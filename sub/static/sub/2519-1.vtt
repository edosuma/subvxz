I work at the mill,
you little fucker.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.919
It's good enough for me.
It was good enough for our dad.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.487
The fucking mill killed our dad!

35:59.960 --> 36:01.719
Just don't be... Hey.

36:01.720 --> 36:05.639
Just don't be too proud
to work for a living.

36:05.640 --> 36:07.199
There's nothing wrong with it.

36:07.200 --> 36:09.159
What'd you say?

36:09.160 --> 36:11.799
Nothing wrong with
working for a living.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.729
- Working for a living?
- Yeah.

36:14.480 --> 36:16.603
What do you call this,
motherfucker?

36:17.720 --> 36:19.919
Is that working for a living, huh?

36:19.920 --> 36:22.559
Is it working for a living when
I carried my best friend's legs

36:22.560 --> 36:25.639
under this arm, and the rest
of him under this arm?

36:25.640 --> 36:29.839
I saw a fucking baby with
his fucking head cut off!

36:29.840 --> 36:31.719
I saw a fucking pile of feet

36:31.720 --> 36:34.239
in the middle of the street,
and I had to clean it up!

36:34.240 --> 36:37.039
I gave my fucking life
for this country.

36:37.040 --> 36:38.159
That's not work?

36:38.160 --> 36:40.599
And what's it done for me, huh?

36:40.600 --> 36:42.404
What's it fucking done for me?!

bring that up again.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.399
I need one last
fucking fight, John.

37:22.400 --> 37:25.959
Just give me one good fight, please.
One good fucking fight, please!

37:25.960 --> 37:27.959
That's all I'm asking you.
Can you please do that for me?

37:27.960 --> 37:29.519
No, you gotta trust
me when I tell you,

37:29.520 --> 37:32.079
you don't want to set foot
in those mountains.

37:32.080 --> 37:33.999
What is the big fucking deal?

37:34.000 --> 37:35.599
The big fucking deal?

37:35.600 --> 37:38.639
The big fucking deal is I've dealt
with these guys for a long time,

37:38.640 --> 37:41.399
and when they don't get what
they want, they get nasty.

37:41.400 --> 37:43.639
They get nasty, do they?

37:43.640 --> 37:45.171
- Yeah. You don't know.
- RODNEY: Yeah?

37:47.240 --> 37:50.239
Well, John, I don't really have

37:50.240 --> 37:52.519
a lot of fucking options, man.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.519
I can't fucking catch up
doing this small-town shit!

37:55.520 --> 37:57.519
- Calm the fuck down.
- Come the fuck on, man!

37:57.520 --> 38:00.319
- Come on, please! I'm sorry!
- I'm trying to protect you!

38:00.320 --> 38:02.682
Just fucking call them up,
John. Please?

38:04.640 --> 38:07.571
I'm not doing it, Rodney.
I'm not gonna call them.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.999
Well, I'm not leaving until you do.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.319

38:21.040 --> 38:22.919
I'm asking you for one fight.
Please call them up.

38:22.920 --> 38:25.566
- Please call them up.
- Fuck, Rodney!

38:32.440 --> 38:36.999
