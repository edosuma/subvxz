00:05.709 --> 00:08.417
-When Mr. Duncan was discussing the Republic, he cited

00:08.458 --> 00:11.625
John Grisham as the author which is obviously wrong.

00:11.667 --> 00:13.625
Can anyone tell me who actually wrote the Republic?

00:13.667 --> 00:15.834
-Correct.

00:18.542 --> 00:20.375
-Definitely.

00:28.125 --> 00:32.417
: You're not as late

00:28.125 --> 00:32.417
as usual, sir.

00:32.458 --> 00:35.083
-Looks like you're teaching the class.

00:35.125 --> 00:37.458
Behind my back.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.500
-Sorry, I'll just... -No, no, no, this is great.

00:39.542 --> 00:41.917
You think this is easy? Good luck. Go ahead.

00:41.959 --> 00:44.917
What's ah...Tell them who Aristotle is.

00:44.959 --> 00:47.959
-Aristotle was a Greek philosopher and scientist.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.750
He's quoted as saying: "We are what we repeatedly do.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.750
So excellence..."

00:51.792 --> 00:54.166
-Okay, no one knows what that means.

00:54.208 --> 00:57.291
-He had no last name.

00:57.333 --> 00:59.542
-Sit down, sit down.

00:59.583 --> 01:02.041
Stupid...Little idea.

01:02.083 --> 01:04.250
Everybody has a last name.

01:04.291 --> 01:06.667
Aristotle Onassis.

01:06.709 --> 01:11.125
Maybe I need to bring her in here as a guest speaker one day.

01:11.166 --> 01:15.500
Please leave the teaching to the professionals.

01:15.542 --> 01:18.083

01:18.125 --> 01:20.792

01:27.333 --> 01:29.250
-My contract got renewed for next year!

01:29.291 --> 01:31.959
: Ha, me too! : And I got all the same

01:29.291 --> 01:31.959
classes.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.333
What a relief to know that there

01:34.375 --> 01:37.041
is a permanent position here waiting for me.

01:39.625 --> 01:42.750
-I'm sorry Gerry, I forgot you were long term occasional.

01:42.792 --> 01:46.583
-Yeah, for now. Maybe that'll... You know...I don't know what...

01:46.625 --> 01:48.875
-Maybe you haven't spoke to Lisa yet.

01:46.625 --> 01:48.875
-Yes!

01:48.917 --> 01:51.709
-Just talked to her... For like, ten minutes.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.917
-Hey! I know what it could be.

01:53.959 --> 01:57.583
Somebody who does have one of these contracts gets, like, sick

01:57.625 --> 02:01.500
I'm talkin' real sick! Goes on long term disability.

02:01.542 --> 02:04.458
So then you got the LTO on the LTD.

02:04.500 --> 02:08.250
Maybe they get and STD and you're coming back in as an LTO.

02:08.291 --> 02:10.959
-Yeah, that didn't help what

02:08.291 --> 02:10.959
you guys...

02:17.083 --> 02:19.291
But listen though, I knew you were coming back.

02:19.333 --> 02:21.667
-I am so happy though, really! 'Cause I just wasn't sure!

02:21.709 --> 02:23.875
Can I at least leave?

02:23.917 --> 02:26.208
: Sorry Gerry. -Before you do that in front

02:23.917 --> 02:26.208
of me?

02:26.250 --> 02:28.667
-I'm sorry too.

02:28.709 --> 02:31.208
Sorry. -I knew you were coming back!

02:31.250 --> 02:34.041
-Oh my gosh! I'm going to get a new apartment I think...

02:34.083 --> 02:36.000
-Okay, maybe I can get around the corner.

02:36.041 --> 02:38.375
Maybe that would help, if I could get around the corner.

02:38.417 --> 02:40.667
It's not like you're whispering. -No, it's...

02:40.709 --> 02:43.250
-I can even hear your feet jumping in celebration.

02:43.291 --> 02:46.083
: Sorry.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.208
: Just wait, for him to go.

02:48.250 --> 02:51.917
: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

02:48.250 --> 02:51.917
he's gone!

02:54.166 --> 02:56.333
: I know!

02:56.375 --> 02:58.583
-I was just like, I hope it all works and then it worked...

03:00.917 --> 03:03.917
-Mr. Cheeley, Miss Duncan-Mason.

03:03.959 --> 03:06.542
You gave everyone a contract today, but me?

03:06.583 --> 03:08.750
-Gerry, you're an LTO. -Exactly!

03:08.792 --> 03:11.583
And I did you both a huge favour taking that LTO 'cause

03:08.792 --> 03:11.583
you had nobody else.

03:11.625 --> 03:15.125
-Mmm, pretty sure we did you the favour letting you back in the

03:11.625 --> 03:15.125
school.

03:15.166 --> 03:17.375
-I want a full-time contract.

03:17.417 --> 03:19.583
-I want a pillow made of Cottonelle kittens.

03:19.625 --> 03:22.625
Just if we're saying out loud all the things we want.

03:19.625 --> 03:22.625
: That's funny.

03:22.667 --> 03:24.792
-I think what Robert's trying to say is that we don't have any

03:24.834 --> 03:27.000
full-time positions right now, Gerry.

03:27.041 --> 03:31.041
-Let me make this even more clear. I need a full-time

03:27.041 --> 03:31.041
contract by end of today,

03:31.083 --> 03:33.875
Or I'm going to another school. -You said end of the day...

03:33.917 --> 03:36.834
Do you mean like end of the school day? Or like, end of

03:33.917 --> 03:36.834
the calendar day?

03:36.875 --> 03:39.875
-The school day's almost over. -End of the day, day, like,

03:36.875 --> 03:39.875
midnight.

03:39.917 --> 03:41.917
-I'm going to be sleeping at midnight.

03:41.959 --> 03:44.834
That's ridiculous!

03:46.291 --> 03:49.792
I just wanted to be absolutely certain how much time we had...

03:49.834 --> 03:51.875
To not give him a contract. -Yup, good call.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
-As you can probably tell, our Head of Phys Ed will be taking

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
maternity leave...

03:57.041 --> 03:59.208
-I don't think you can see. -To give birth to...

03:59.250 --> 04:01.333
: Our : Child.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.542
-You don't need to tell anybody that.

04:03.583 --> 04:07.625
Wow.

04:07.667 --> 04:09.959
Bobbi here can barely even swim. -No, I can swim.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.500
-You should swim more 'cause it would be good for your

04:10.000 --> 04:12.500
arthritis.

04:14.750 --> 04:17.875
: Speaking of swimming, do, do, do, do.

04:14.750 --> 04:17.875
: Wow.

04:17.917 --> 04:20.834
-I mean...You guys are icons.

04:20.875 --> 04:23.458
-We're just so thrilled that you'd consider us for this

04:20.875 --> 04:23.458
position.

04:23.500 --> 04:27.041
-You know, we have over twenty-five years of teaching

04:23.500 --> 04:27.041
fitness.

04:27.083 --> 04:29.750
And we were contestants on The Amazing Race.

04:29.792 --> 04:31.959
So, we think we have a lot to offer the school.

04:32.041 --> 04:35.583
-Understatement of the millennium! You ever done

04:32.041 --> 04:35.583
The Amazing Race?

04:35.625 --> 04:37.583
-Well no, but that doesn't say anything.

04:35.625 --> 04:37.583
-Right.

04:37.625 --> 04:39.834
-You should try it. It is amazing!

04:42.083 --> 04:45.250
-In the circle of honesty, there is one thing I feel a tiny bit

04:42.083 --> 04:45.250
weird about.

04:45.291 --> 04:48.709
It's the idea of you two sharing a salary. Are you sure you're

04:45.291 --> 04:48.709
okay with that?

04:48.750 --> 04:51.041
-This isn't about money for us, at all.

04:51.083 --> 04:53.375
-I have to say, I think you're very worthy candidates.

04:53.417 --> 04:55.667
-These guys don't even have their education degree

04:55.709 --> 04:59.917
If you have a degree but you don't have the

04:55.709 --> 04:59.917
passion to help kids get active.

04:59.959 --> 05:03.959
Are you looking got somebody that doesn't want to really

04:59.959 --> 05:03.959
make it their passion...

05:04.000 --> 05:06.417
Their life : Why are you yelling

05:04.000 --> 05:06.417
at me?

05:06.458 --> 05:08.625
-You've got to move. -We have done stuff on the job.

05:08.667 --> 05:11.375
: Okay. -We have been in the trenches.

05:08.667 --> 05:11.375
We know what these kids need.

05:11.417 --> 05:15.375
-Strapping on a helmut and storming the beaches of physical

05:11.417 --> 05:15.375
fitness is what it's about!

05:15.417 --> 05:17.583
: Exactly! : It's not important.

05:17.625 --> 05:20.458
: It's not important. -That's what I always say, those

05:17.625 --> 05:20.458
who can't teach, do!

05:20.500 --> 05:23.583
:

05:20.500 --> 05:23.583
And have fun.

05:23.625 --> 05:26.208
-Body Break! -Oh God.

05:29.375 --> 05:32.458
Okay, it seems as though I've come in under budget this year.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.667
Yay me!

05:34.709 --> 05:37.625
So, I just wanted to spend all of that money on the staff!

05:37.667 --> 05:40.917
So, I'm planning a little soirée at Maison de Lisa.

05:40.959 --> 05:44.959
I hope you can all attend. Just a thank you for all of

05:40.959 --> 05:44.959
your hard work this year.

05:47.208 --> 05:49.542
-Oh, I'm sure I can arrange something.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.750
Is a magician!

05:51.792 --> 05:55.125
-You should get a Mariachi band. -Or yeah, you know what else is

05:51.792 --> 05:55.125
a huge party pleaser?

05:55.166 --> 05:58.834
-Condoms and lube. -No, well I was going to say

05:55.166 --> 05:58.834
chocolate fountain!

05:58.875 --> 06:01.375
-You guys really know how to throw a soirée.

06:01.417 --> 06:05.291
Alright, tell everyone that you know it's going to be at 7:30

06:01.417 --> 06:05.291
tomorrow night.

06:05.333 --> 06:07.417
Don't be late! : Okay.

06:07.458 --> 06:11.458
-Maybe I bring wifey. -Oh, Mr. Malik, I'm so sorry.

06:11.500 --> 06:14.333
It's actually kind of more of an admin/faculty thing.

06:14.375 --> 06:16.834
Plus, I need you to lock up. I hope you understand.

06:16.875 --> 06:19.375
: Malik only joking.

06:16.875 --> 06:19.375
-Good one.

06:27.667 --> 06:30.709
-How could they not offer me a position after everything I've

06:27.667 --> 06:30.709
done for that school? -I see what you've done to that

06:30.750 --> 06:33.792
school, not so much what you've done for it.

06:33.834 --> 06:36.458
-They wouldn't know talent if it slapped them in the face.

06:33.834 --> 06:36.458
-Yeah.

06:38.917 --> 06:42.291
-Absolutely. I mean, the board, technically. But I know what you

06:38.917 --> 06:42.291
mean.

06:42.333 --> 06:44.500
-If I was in charge, things would be pretty different.

06:46.750 --> 06:50.250
-I'd also value teachers who realize it's not just about

06:46.750 --> 06:50.250
teaching when you're a teacher.

06:50.291 --> 06:52.291
-No. -No, not with you.

06:52.333 --> 06:55.166
-Connecting with the students.

06:55.208 --> 06:57.875
-Connecting with the students. It's not about education and

06:55.208 --> 06:57.875
learning.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.792
It's about connecting, and I'm the best at that.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.792
-I think you're a visionary.

07:00.834 --> 07:04.208
And I've said it before and I still believe it and it's too

07:00.834 --> 07:04.208
bad you're not in charge.

07:07.667 --> 07:10.375
-Too bad I'm not in charge...

07:10.417 --> 07:14.375
Yet. : Oh.

07:10.417 --> 07:14.375
What does he mean by yet?

07:14.417 --> 07:17.875
-I don't know what the hell he's talking about most of the time.

07:14.417 --> 07:17.875
-Okay.

07:17.917 --> 07:20.166
-It's been a couple of days of interviews with Robert, so...

07:20.208 --> 07:23.208
-Well, I'll tell you how

07:20.208 --> 07:23.208
it's not going...

07:23.250 --> 07:27.208
Terrible! 'Cause it's not going terrible. It's going so well.

07:27.250 --> 07:30.166
-Okay, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say something's

07:27.250 --> 07:30.166
wrong.

07:30.208 --> 07:32.500
I'm just...

07:32.542 --> 07:36.166
Interviewing one overqualified candidate after another to

07:32.542 --> 07:36.166
take my job.

07:36.208 --> 07:38.750
And that's cool. Right? It's fun for me.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.291
Good times. Hey! -Okay. Hello.

07:44.291 --> 07:48.125
Fat chance.

07:50.458 --> 07:54.208
-Yeah. -They're kind and fit and oozing

07:50.458 --> 07:54.208
charisma.

07:54.250 --> 07:57.959
You really shot yourself in the foot bringing them in, Bobbi.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.542
-Okay, well...Thanks, I feel way better.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.417
: So...

08:05.458 --> 08:09.667
By now you've all heard that I did not get a contract next

08:05.458 --> 08:09.667
year.

08:09.709 --> 08:13.375
Shocking as that seems. So I'm starting my own private school.

08:13.417 --> 08:17.041
-I don't know, private school,

08:13.417 --> 08:17.041
charter school, whatever!

08:17.083 --> 08:20.041
Who's coming? My own school, I'm starting it, who wants to

08:17.083 --> 08:20.041
come?

08:20.083 --> 08:23.583
Let's go! Who's in? No, not you. Someone else.

08:23.625 --> 08:26.917
Private school! I'm your boss. Think of that for a second.

08:26.959 --> 08:29.125
Who's coming? Dwyer, come on.

08:29.166 --> 08:31.083
: I think I'll pass Gerry.

08:31.125 --> 08:33.291
-You know, I was just being polite.

08:33.333 --> 08:36.542
'Cause there's only one Mr. D at this school and you're

08:33.333 --> 08:36.542
looking at him, so you're out.

08:36.583 --> 08:39.125
Who's in

08:39.166 --> 08:41.875
Let's do this. -Yeah, Gerry I would come...

08:41.917 --> 08:44.792
-There you go! -But I don't want to at all.

08:44.834 --> 08:47.083
So, I can't.

08:47.125 --> 08:49.333
Come on Simon. Let's go.

08:51.959 --> 08:55.333
-Simon. -This is the hardest decision

08:51.959 --> 08:55.333
I've ever made...

08:55.375 --> 08:57.709
But I don't think I can come with you.

08:57.750 --> 09:00.667
: I believe in you!

09:00.709 --> 09:04.000
I just think you won't succeed.

09:04.041 --> 09:07.041
Well this is embarrassing now.

09:07.083 --> 09:09.834
It's embarrassing now. Okay.

09:09.875 --> 09:12.250
-I will join you. -Thank you Mr. Malik!

09:12.291 --> 09:15.625
Not my first choice. But we need a caretaker.

09:15.667 --> 09:17.834
It's a start.

09:17.875 --> 09:19.333
We're gonna have a clean school.

09:20.625 --> 09:22.959
: Bring those supplies, I have nothing

09:20.625 --> 09:22.959
right now.

09:26.083 --> 09:29.291
Peace out, Xavier Academy! Peace out!

09:32.792 --> 09:34.834
: Mr. Malik?

09:35.500 --> 09:38.125
We need a copier at the school.

09:39.333 --> 09:41.792
: We're gonna go get this fixed.

09:45.417 --> 09:48.083
See what I'm doin' when I fix it?

09:48.125 --> 09:50.291
-It's okay.

09:59.041 --> 10:01.208
-So excited to start next chapter in Malik's life.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.500
Where exactly is this new school?

10:03.542 --> 10:05.709
-Oh, the school is... Ah, still looking.

10:05.750 --> 10:08.166
But I have a building that I saw...

10:08.208 --> 10:11.583
And I'm thinking of, real fixer upper so you'll...

10:11.625 --> 10:13.583
-I fix it. -That's why we're a team.

10:13.625 --> 10:16.500
Oh, speaking of team, I also need your cut of the deposit.

10:16.542 --> 10:19.333
-We all have to contribute

10:16.542 --> 10:19.333
money to this.

10:19.375 --> 10:21.625
-But, you're the owner. You must have money.

10:21.667 --> 10:24.041
-I'm the idea guy. You're the money guy.

10:24.083 --> 10:26.834
That's what I forgot to tell ya. -I clean waste...

10:26.875 --> 10:30.166
For a living. Obviously I have no money.

10:30.208 --> 10:32.667
-I just assumed you had money...

10:32.709 --> 10:35.375
Back overseas...Hidden and...

10:35.417 --> 10:38.125
So what are you bringing to this partnership?

10:38.166 --> 10:40.166
-I bring...The mop.

10:40.959 --> 10:43.125
The mop.

10:43.166 --> 10:46.041
-First of all, we have no floors right now to clean.

10:46.083 --> 10:49.333
So a mop is useless. -Ah, the chicken and the egg.

10:49.375 --> 10:53.041
: Forget it, I'll figure this out. This isn't going well.

10:53.083 --> 10:56.125
-Hey. -Just looking at Hal and

10:53.083 --> 10:56.125
Joanne's website.

10:56.166 --> 10:58.333
But I could take a Bobbi break. Yeah, that's actually what I

10:58.375 --> 11:00.542
want to talk to you about.

11:00.583 --> 11:02.792
Why would they be coming down to slum it with the rest of us?

11:02.834 --> 11:06.375
It's a publicity stunt, Robert.  For us!

11:06.417 --> 11:10.166
We get Hal and Joanne on staff, suddenly it's raining students.

11:10.208 --> 11:13.625
-I don't trust them! They smile too much and they look to clean.

11:13.667 --> 11:15.583
Alright? And this stresses me out!

11:15.625 --> 11:17.792
And when I get stressed out the baby gets stressed out.

11:17.834 --> 11:20.000
Is that what you want

11:20.041 --> 11:23.625
No. No, of course not. Just calm down!

11:23.667 --> 11:25.834
: Hush little fetus.

11:25.875 --> 11:28.709
A stressed out baby's the leading cause of adult

11:25.875 --> 11:28.709
delinquency.

11:28.750 --> 11:32.959
-If you want to have a baby that's a delinquent, then you

11:28.750 --> 11:32.959
should hire Hal and Joanne.

11:36.125 --> 11:38.291
: I don't know what to do.

11:38.333 --> 11:42.250
-Robbie, I think we need to have a fresh new round of interviews.

11:42.291 --> 11:44.792
You know, for the baby.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.834
-Starting to look like his old man.

11:54.875 --> 11:59.500
-I'm wondering how well you sanitize your chocolate

11:54.875 --> 11:59.500
fountains between parties.

11:59.542 --> 12:02.542
I'm just concerned that... Gerry!

12:02.583 --> 12:06.041
-I'm more important. Um, you may have heard.

12:06.083 --> 12:09.417
Good news, I'm starting a charter school.

12:09.458 --> 12:12.000
-And, as my wife, I would like to offer you

12:12.041 --> 12:14.542
a chance to be a major shareholder.

12:14.583 --> 12:16.750
-No, thank you.

12:21.667 --> 12:23.625
Fine, I'm going to be principal of the school...

12:24.917 --> 12:27.333
I will make you vice principal if you lend me some money.

12:27.375 --> 12:29.500
-Okay, I'll tell you what Gerry.

12:29.542 --> 12:34.208
You get one kid to sign up for your stupid idea and I'll give

12:29.542 --> 12:34.208
you every dollar I have.

12:34.250 --> 12:36.750
-Well, I will take it all, if you are serious.

12:36.792 --> 12:41.375
-If it gets you out of my office, yes!

12:36.792 --> 12:41.375
-It will! Challenge accepted.

12:41.417 --> 12:43.333
♪ Music

12:43.375 --> 12:46.583
-This has been such a treat. You are exactly what Xavier needs.

12:46.625 --> 12:48.291
Isn't that right, Robert?

12:49.208 --> 12:53.166
: Yes! We'll definitely have to consider it.

12:53.208 --> 12:56.792
-And by "consider," he means you're definitely going to get a

12:53.208 --> 12:56.792
phone call.

12:56.834 --> 12:59.917
: Aww.

12:59.959 --> 13:03.083
-It's a real pleasure. -And us too. Thank you.

13:03.125 --> 13:05.917
: Thank you.

13:05.959 --> 13:09.709
And so wise and experienced.

13:09.750 --> 13:12.667
-I was thinking maybe he could teach the war of 1812...

13:12.709 --> 13:15.208
Because he was there. -Robert!

13:15.250 --> 13:18.500
That is very ageist. I'm really excited about this.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.166
Oh, my goodness!

13:22.208 --> 13:24.917
-The baby just kicked, Robert.

13:24.959 --> 13:27.125
This is what the baby wants too.

13:29.125 --> 13:31.917
Well, if that's what you want Little Guy, that's what you're

13:29.125 --> 13:31.917
gonna get.

13:31.959 --> 13:34.125
: Mmm, thank you daddy.

13:34.166 --> 13:36.959
-Hello! I'm here for the interview.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.500
-Bit of a red flag. -Aren't you both sweet.

13:39.542 --> 13:41.792
It's been a real pleasure. -Okay.

13:41.834 --> 13:43.458
-Mmm, bye bye. -Thank you, bye bye.

13:44.959 --> 13:48.250
-Hi, grab a flyer. Any questions, come on back.

13:44.959 --> 13:48.250
Let us know, email us.

13:48.291 --> 13:50.542
Hi, good evening. Welcome. -Hi.

13:50.583 --> 13:53.333
I don't understand why you're having the open house here.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.542
Is the school going to be part of Xavier?

13:55.583 --> 13:58.083
-Ah, well, we're showing you a replica of our school.

13:58.125 --> 14:00.875
So, we like to show you, this is what it will look like.

14:00.917 --> 14:04.041
But better. With, you know, lockers, gym, halls.

14:04.083 --> 14:07.542
Everything the same, but better. -And cleaner. Malik bring mop.

14:07.583 --> 14:10.250
-That's Malik. Mr. Malik. So...

14:10.291 --> 14:12.417
-Hi, welcome. Hello there.

14:18.041 --> 14:21.000
We ahhh...Rugby. Yeah, that's a big one right now.

14:21.041 --> 14:23.959
And you will be my hooker. That's an important roll.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Ah, basketball. We'll do some of that. Ah...

14:27.041 --> 14:29.458
-Swimming. -No, no swimming.

14:27.041 --> 14:29.458
No. We're not...

14:29.500 --> 14:32.333
: There's no swimming. : We're not getting a

14:29.500 --> 14:32.333
pool.

14:32.375 --> 14:35.625
-And what sort of assistance will you have for autistic

14:32.375 --> 14:35.625
children.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.000
-Um, hello. Hi.

Autistic, autistic... -We will ah...

14:41.875 --> 14:44.792

14:44.834 --> 14:47.208
: To teach all of our autistic students.

14:47.250 --> 14:49.458
-Yeah, so they can relate.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.792
We'll have an autistic teacher to relate to the kids.

14:51.834 --> 14:55.041
-Hi, my daughter's deaf, how would the school accommodate

14:51.834 --> 14:55.041
her?

14:55.083 --> 14:57.709
-We will hire a deaf teacher.

14:58.709 --> 15:02.291
-Thank you. -Thank you. I know some sign.

15:02.333 --> 15:04.709
: That's thank you.

15:04.750 --> 15:07.166
That's chocolate bar. Yeah.

15:07.208 --> 15:09.375
Chocolate bar, right?

15:09.417 --> 15:11.583
That's how you say chocolate bar?

15:11.625 --> 15:13.709
Would you like a chocolate bar?

15:14.917 --> 15:17.625
Haha, we don't have any. Anyway, grab some flyers.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.709
If you need to copy anything for your own stuff at home.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.458
Questions, email us.

15:23.792 --> 15:27.250
Oh my gosh. Oh no, I know why they were all special needs.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.834
Idiots?

15:31.875 --> 15:34.250
: We

15:34.291 --> 15:36.709
Alright, alright.

15:36.750 --> 15:38.750
We'll do a school for special needs kids.

15:38.792 --> 15:41.542
That's how we'll market it. You teach the deaf kids.

15:41.583 --> 15:44.083
-I will teach deaf kids. -'Cause they...just do

15:41.583 --> 15:44.083
that a lot.

15:44.125 --> 15:46.333
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

15:44.125 --> 15:46.333
-Thank you.

15:46.375 --> 15:49.250
Want a chocolate bar?

15:49.291 --> 15:52.000
-One more won't hurt.

15:52.041 --> 15:54.166
: What? -Lisa's paying.

15:54.208 --> 15:56.375
-Right!

15:56.417 --> 15:58.583
Has anybody seen Lisa?

15:58.625 --> 16:00.542
-Yeah, kind of rude to miss your own shindig.

16:00.583 --> 16:02.834
-Ah, give her a break. She's had a rough year.

16:02.875 --> 16:05.333
: Awww. -So true Robert, I mean Lisa's

16:02.875 --> 16:05.333
a great person.

16:05.375 --> 16:07.542
: Yes she is. -To Lisa!

16:07.583 --> 16:09.750
: Aw. : To Lisa.

16:09.792 --> 16:11.709
: Alright.

16:11.750 --> 16:14.125
: This water's strong.

16:19.458 --> 16:21.917
-It's my own fault for trusting a gang of idiots.

16:24.166 --> 16:26.458
-Everybody get out! Ándele!

16:26.500 --> 16:28.458
-Vamonos!

16:36.500 --> 16:38.834
-No, we're not agreed.

16:38.875 --> 16:42.417
I would rather stick shards of glass in my nipples.

16:42.458 --> 16:45.917
-Yeah, but I just think it's the best compromise. I mean we both

16:42.458 --> 16:45.917
think so.

16:45.959 --> 16:48.542
Right Mmm mm.

16:48.583 --> 16:50.750
: I need to grab a couple more things.

16:53.041 --> 16:56.375
-It's going really well Frank. We had an open house last night.

16:56.417 --> 16:58.709
It was packed, very successful. So...

16:58.750 --> 17:01.875
When the school takes off don't come running...Don't come...

17:01.917 --> 17:04.333
Walking to the best of your ability to me.

17:04.375 --> 17:07.458
-Don't hold your breath, Gerry. I'm pretty happy right where

17:04.375 --> 17:07.458
I am.

17:09.583 --> 17:11.333
-Our library is called Google.

17:12.542 --> 17:15.417
-Google is our library. -I just said that Mr. Malik.

17:15.458 --> 17:18.166
-Well, look who it is!

17:18.208 --> 17:21.959
My esteemed "friends" and colleagues.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.125
: What are you doing? -So nice of you all to show up

17:22.000 --> 17:25.125
to this dump.

17:25.166 --> 17:27.375
-Oh my God. -Where the hell were you

17:25.166 --> 17:27.375
guys last night?

17:27.417 --> 17:29.417
: Open house. -We were at "Maison de Lisa!"

17:29.458 --> 17:32.166
-Best boeuf boill...ah borg...

17:32.208 --> 17:34.875
: It's hard to say. -Bourguignon I've ever had.

17:34.917 --> 17:37.709
I didn't care for it.

17:37.750 --> 17:40.291
-I liked it. -Boeuf wasn't for me.

17:40.333 --> 17:42.542
-I can't believe you didn't show up. Lisa, why weren't

17:40.333 --> 17:42.542
you there?

17:42.583 --> 17:45.750
-Okay, stop! Do not mock me!

17:45.792 --> 17:47.875
How dare you!

17:47.917 --> 17:51.625
You're all nothing but a bunch of ungrateful, worthless...

17:51.667 --> 17:54.041
Soul sucking liars!

17:54.083 --> 17:56.375
-Which is why we're not hiring you at our new school.

17:56.417 --> 17:58.583
-Lisa Mason!

17:58.625 --> 18:01.250
-I am done with all of you!

18:01.291 --> 18:03.959
And Gerry, that stupid charter school thing?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.166
-Let me just... -You can count me in.

18:06.208 --> 18:08.375
: Really? -Because I quit!

18:08.417 --> 18:10.834
: That's going to help

18:08.417 --> 18:10.834
us financially, a lot!

18:10.875 --> 18:13.125
With us getting more people!

18:10.875 --> 18:13.125
: Yeah?

18:15.417 --> 18:17.959
: Gerry.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.792
: Shhh, I'm out. Sorry.

18:20.834 --> 18:25.542
Oh man...And Lisa's leaving. She's starting a charter school.

18:25.583 --> 18:29.208
-Me.

18:29.250 --> 18:31.583
-Your wish too. I'm pretty excited.

18:33.834 --> 18:36.208
-I would like a hug... From my boss.

18:39.417 --> 18:42.542
-That's a great day for all of us...Two of us.

18:42.583 --> 18:44.834
-Ahh...Lisa, shhh.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.917
-I have tears as well.

18:49.208 --> 18:51.417
-Lisa! Lisa! -Leave me alone Gerry.

18:51.458 --> 18:53.625
Aren't you supposed to be in class?

18:53.667 --> 18:55.834
-You don't even work here, so mind your own business.

18:55.875 --> 18:58.041
-I can't believe you did that to me.

18:58.083 --> 19:00.250
I can't believe you just threw me under the bus like that.

19:00.291 --> 19:02.875
-I got offered Phys Ed. I'm sorry but you know how

19:00.291 --> 19:02.875
badly I want Phys Ed.

19:02.917 --> 19:05.125
It's my dream job.

19:05.166 --> 19:07.333
: I don't know. You'll figure it out.

19:07.375 --> 19:09.583
You land on your feet. You're Lisa Mason!

19:09.625 --> 19:12.250
You're a strong independent woman.

19:12.291 --> 19:15.291
-You're right, I am strong.

19:15.333 --> 19:17.959
And I can bounce back from anything. Thank you.

19:20.375 --> 19:24.083
-You know, the moments are few and far between.

19:24.125 --> 19:28.709
But every once in a blue moon you can be a pretty half

19:24.125 --> 19:28.709
decent husband.

19:28.750 --> 19:32.834
-Oh! Almost forgot, that's why I came after you.

19:32.875 --> 19:37.083
Ahh, gotta get an annulment. Gotta get out of this.

19:37.125 --> 19:41.083
-Come on. I'm on the upswing, you're on a downward spiral to

19:37.125 --> 19:41.083
a nervous breakdown.

19:41.125 --> 19:43.917
I can't be married to that. Right? You get it.

19:43.959 --> 19:46.208
I'm done with this. I have class right now.

19:46.250 --> 19:49.583
I left just to... Okay, I gotta go.

19:49.625 --> 19:51.792
Good luck.
