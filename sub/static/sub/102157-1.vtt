11:15.109 --> 11:16.197
Work going okay?

11:16.240 --> 11:17.154
Yeah.

11:17.198 --> 11:19.896
It's just, you know, busy.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.726
Saul, could you
please get some plates

11:23.770 --> 11:26.120
and forks and cups in the back?

11:26.163 --> 11:28.165
- Sure thing.
- Great.

11:28.209 --> 11:33.997
I can't believe your dad managed
to get 100 people in here.

11:34.041 --> 11:34.955
I remember.

11:36.304 --> 11:39.176
I remember running around
through people's legs

11:39.220 --> 11:40.134
trying to help out.

11:41.352 --> 11:42.745
Whew, that was fun.

11:42.789 --> 11:45.226
I loved watching
you help your dad.

11:45.269 --> 11:47.924
You've certainly inherited
his work ethic.

11:52.276 --> 11:54.801
Is today a good day for him?

11:54.844 --> 11:57.238
He got a little
confused on the drive,

11:57.281 --> 12:00.284
but otherwise, he's
been very present all day.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.071
Oh, you forgot the cups.

12:06.508 --> 12:09.293
It's okay, we can do without.

12:14.429 --> 12:19.434
So, any time in your
schedule this week for a date?

12:23.090 --> 12:26.180
You guys are the only reason
I'm eating dinner tonight.

12:26.223 --> 12:28.138
Billie, it's been three years.

12:29.357 --> 12:32.186
When I have the time,
I will make the time.

12:32.229 --> 12:33.404
Okay?

12:33.448 --> 12:34.362
All right.

12:34.405 --> 12:36.799
Woof and I are starving.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.932
You think we can get
this party started?

12:38.975 --> 12:39.802
Yes.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.152
Here you go.

12:49.333 --> 12:50.857
Why are you here?

12:50.900 --> 12:52.815
And why are you not out scouting
the location on Broadway,

12:52.859 --> 12:54.643
or the lot on 5th?

12:54.686 --> 12:57.037
Or any of the other spaces
Leopold

12:57.080 --> 12:59.300
included in his
very time consuming

12:59.343 --> 13:01.650
yet ambitious list
he made for you?

13:01.693 --> 13:03.826
I've actually got a
new property to move on.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.393
Warehouse space
on Meridian Street.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.743
Prime real estate,
solid long-term investment.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.179
Interesting...

13:09.223 --> 13:11.007
And I need to push the
property scout to next week.

13:11.051 --> 13:11.921
Unacceptable.

13:11.965 --> 13:13.270
I need the time for Max.

13:13.314 --> 13:14.837
And it's important.

13:14.881 --> 13:17.971
I would never ask for any
other reason than family.

13:18.014 --> 13:19.581
Yes.

13:19.624 --> 13:22.323
I understand a thing or two
about doing things for family.

13:22.366 --> 13:23.498
Don't I, Charlie?

13:23.541 --> 13:25.761
Yes, you are
quite the family man

13:25.805 --> 13:27.937
and we all respect
and appreciate that

13:27.981 --> 13:29.199
about you very much.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.113
Okay then.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.379
Thanks, Uncle Edward.

13:44.693 --> 13:45.520
Wow.

13:46.477 --> 13:49.611
Exposed brick, concrete floors.

13:49.654 --> 13:51.091
Not too shabby, Billie.

13:52.135 --> 13:54.137
We haven't officially met.

13:55.443 --> 13:56.313
What's your name?

13:57.271 --> 13:58.054
Woof.

13:58.098 --> 13:58.925
Come again?

13:58.968 --> 14:00.448
It's after my favorite chef.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.189
You know, Wolfgang Puck.

14:02.232 --> 14:03.581
Creative.

14:03.625 --> 14:04.669
[Woof barking]

14:04.713 --> 14:05.888
Oh I know buddy, I know.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.542
Time for your walk, let's go.

14:07.585 --> 14:09.631
Let me take that off your plate,
I'll take him.

14:09.674 --> 14:10.980
Oh, I doubt that.

14:11.024 --> 14:13.243
You can only take him
if you can pass this test.

14:13.287 --> 14:14.636
What's that?

14:14.679 --> 14:16.420
Give him his favorite treat.

14:16.464 --> 14:18.031
Crunchy bacon.

14:18.074 --> 14:19.510
Child's play.

14:19.554 --> 14:20.903
First of all, much
like everybody else,

14:20.947 --> 14:22.209
dogs love me.

14:22.252 --> 14:23.427
Ugh.

14:23.471 --> 14:25.386
And besides, what
dog won't take bacon?

14:32.915 --> 14:34.177
See?

14:34.221 --> 14:37.354
He can tell when someone
is overly compensating

14:37.398 --> 14:38.921
and being difficult.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.792
Not even bacon can fix it.

14:43.491 --> 14:45.014
Your loss, champ.

14:45.058 --> 14:47.930
Right, so I'm gonna walk him,

14:47.974 --> 14:50.715
and you have some reading to do.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.239
Come on! Let's go!

14:55.895 --> 15:00.551
Cake, cocktails, DJ, food.

15:00.595 --> 15:02.336
As a fierce believer
in the old adage,

15:02.379 --> 15:04.686
"Communication is key,"
they both had a lot

15:04.729 --> 15:07.123
of trouble staying
on the same page.

15:07.167 --> 15:09.996
What, caviar didn't pair well
with mac and cheese?

15:10.039 --> 15:11.780
Yeah. I told him to add bacon.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.043
Nevermind.

15:14.087 --> 15:16.567
Usually they're great
at talking things through.

15:16.611 --> 15:18.178
Maybe you could talk to Jess?

15:18.221 --> 15:21.050
I can try, but I don't know
how receptive she'll be.

15:21.094 --> 15:22.791
I mean, I did just meet her.

15:22.834 --> 15:23.792
Yeah, I love this idea too.

15:23.835 --> 15:24.924
Let's run with it.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.621
And I can talk to Max again.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.057
One on one.

15:28.101 --> 15:28.928
You ready?

15:28.971 --> 15:29.754
Now?

15:29.798 --> 15:30.930
Oh, and hey Billie,

15:30.973 --> 15:33.671
maybe this time try
positive advice

15:33.715 --> 15:35.891
as opposed to the opposite,
which is bad.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.548
That was too soon, Chuck.

15:43.551 --> 15:45.161
Do me a favor and load these.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.078
Thanks a million.

15:52.647 --> 15:54.388
[Charlie sneezing]

15:54.431 --> 15:56.520
All right, all five
million allergy traps

15:56.564 --> 15:58.000
have been successfully deposited

15:58.044 --> 16:00.742
into your ancient
submarine on wheels.

16:00.785 --> 16:03.614
Betsy is the sturdiest.

16:03.658 --> 16:05.007
Of course you named her.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.053
Okay, Operation Save
Max and Jess commences now!

16:07.096 --> 16:07.967
Oh!

16:08.010 --> 16:09.620
Jess just responded to me.

16:09.664 --> 16:11.100
She wants to meet
back here in an hour.

16:11.144 --> 16:12.275
Sold.

16:12.319 --> 16:13.189
I'm headed to Max,
let's regroup after.

16:13.233 --> 16:14.277
Can't wait!

16:20.022 --> 16:21.763
Thanks for meeting me.

16:21.806 --> 16:24.635
I spoke to Charlie and reviewed
all your wedding items.

16:24.679 --> 16:29.466
And step one, donating all
the non-returnable items.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.251
Oh, yes, of course.

16:31.294 --> 16:32.165
Great idea.

16:32.208 --> 16:35.472
First, I wanted to apologize.

16:35.516 --> 16:36.299
If I said anything that...

16:36.343 --> 16:37.431
Oh, no, no, no, no.

16:37.474 --> 16:38.649
Don't.

16:38.693 --> 16:40.738
This was our decision
and it was better

16:40.782 --> 16:41.652
sooner than later.

16:41.696 --> 16:42.784
I understand...

16:45.221 --> 16:46.918
Can I ask you something?

16:46.962 --> 16:48.050
Of course!

16:48.094 --> 16:49.443
How'd you get through it?

16:50.661 --> 16:52.663
Sorry if I'm prying.

16:52.707 --> 16:53.621
No, it's okay.

16:55.710 --> 16:58.191
The absence of the
person is the hardest.

16:59.714 --> 17:02.934
You're so used to
them being there.

17:04.675 --> 17:06.068
Yeah.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.897
Eventually, it does get better.

17:10.246 --> 17:11.900
Mornings are the hardest.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.685
We had this routine where
we jogged together

17:14.729 --> 17:17.384
down to the bay
and then stop for coffee.

17:17.427 --> 17:18.950
And then he'd make eggs
while I showered

17:18.994 --> 17:20.648
and then I'd clean
while he showered.

17:20.691 --> 17:22.389
But before we'd
say goodbye he'd...

17:24.260 --> 17:25.479
I am so sorry.

17:25.522 --> 17:28.525
I do not know why I am
telling you all of this.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.092
Besides, it's all
in the past now.

17:30.136 --> 17:32.486
When it should be
about moving forward.

17:42.496 --> 17:44.150
That breakfast routine
sounds pretty cool.

17:44.193 --> 17:45.934
And hard to come by,
if you ask me.

17:45.977 --> 17:48.545
I always made the eggs
'cause hers are like rubber.

17:48.589 --> 17:50.460
I never tell her that though.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.027
She thought hers were perfect.

17:53.202 --> 17:54.247
It has to be perfect.

17:54.290 --> 17:55.857
It's not fair, Max.

17:55.900 --> 17:59.208
This one small wedding
turned into a major expense.

17:59.252 --> 18:01.993
I'm a public school teacher,
not a bank.

18:03.038 --> 18:05.301
Don't you think you're
overreacting just a touch?

18:05.345 --> 18:06.520
This wedding should have had

18:06.563 --> 18:08.087
personal meaning
leading the way.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.305
It's what mom would've wanted.

18:09.349 --> 18:10.654
Look, I'm all for honoring mom.

18:10.698 --> 18:12.134
And she would've
loved the sentiment,

18:12.178 --> 18:14.093
but what about what you want?

18:14.136 --> 18:15.224
And what Jess wants?

18:15.268 --> 18:16.399
What about what you both want?

18:16.443 --> 18:17.705
Charlie, listen to me.

18:17.748 --> 18:19.359
No, I really need
you to hear me on this.

18:19.402 --> 18:21.622
It just wasn't meant to be.

18:21.665 --> 18:23.406
How can you say that?

18:23.450 --> 18:25.016
I know Jess still loves you

18:25.060 --> 18:26.148
no matter how
stubborn you can be.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.280
Why can't you let this go?

18:27.323 --> 18:29.108
Because you're
making a huge mistake!

18:30.457 --> 18:33.329
All I'm saying is someone needs
to give it to you straight.

18:33.373 --> 18:34.765
And you're not my parent.

18:35.810 --> 18:36.637
Drop it.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.165
And your swing is embarrassing.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.428
Yeah, says the guy who
brought a putter to chip.

18:45.472 --> 18:49.476
They're your clubs,
and I shoot left.

18:55.351 --> 18:57.484
We're gonna need
to get sneakier.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.747
Let's start with what
needs to happen on my end.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.792
Wedding cake is non-refundable.

19:01.836 --> 19:02.967
Anything I can do there?

19:03.011 --> 19:06.014
No, the cake is
still a sore subject,

19:06.057 --> 19:07.581
but they did both
love the tasting.

19:07.624 --> 19:09.800
Food is a shared
passion of theirs.

19:09.844 --> 19:11.672
Clearly that runs in the family.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.239
But you might be onto something.

19:13.282 --> 19:16.111
Breaking bread does have a way
of diffusing most issues.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.635
And they did both just mention
a cute cooking routine.

19:18.679 --> 19:21.160
They also love making
brownies together.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.946
Just a hunch, baked
goods aren't likely

19:24.989 --> 19:26.121
gonna sell anything.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.470
You have to start somewhere.

19:27.514 --> 19:28.819
If you spend too much
time staring a problem,

19:28.863 --> 19:30.430
it only gets bigger.

19:30.473 --> 19:33.084
You are aware that doesn't
make any sense, right?

19:33.128 --> 19:34.651
It makes a lot of sense.

19:34.695 --> 19:37.524
Okay, I will call the bakery
and see if they have any ideas.

19:37.567 --> 19:38.742
See?

19:38.786 --> 19:40.614
We're already breaking bread,
you and I.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.710
[Charlie sneezing]

19:53.279 --> 19:54.410
Wow...

19:55.977 --> 19:57.326
Are you okay?

19:57.370 --> 19:59.241
I think I might be allergic.

19:59.285 --> 20:00.808
I think you might be dying.

20:00.851 --> 20:01.722
I'll be fine.

20:01.765 --> 20:03.376
Now, tell me, how'd I do?

20:04.377 --> 20:06.509
And I won't let it
go to my head.

20:07.815 --> 20:09.251
Back to the play.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.210
Okay, so, I talked to
the owner of the bakeshop

20:11.253 --> 20:12.733
and I arranged
for the four of us

20:12.776 --> 20:14.256
to relieve his staff
in the morning,

20:14.300 --> 20:17.738
and in exchange, he's gonna
discount the cake by half.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.087
I'm not a professional baker.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.262
Oh no, I'm aware.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.656
But, guess what
we're gonna be making?

20:22.699 --> 20:23.483
Brownies?

20:23.526 --> 20:24.397
Yeah!

20:24.440 --> 20:25.702
And the recipe's super simple.

20:25.746 --> 20:27.008
Awesome.

20:27.051 --> 20:28.618
Yeah! But we're gonna
need to up the workload,

20:28.662 --> 20:30.011
however if we're gonna dedicate

20:30.054 --> 20:32.056
the entire morning
to baking brownies.

20:34.102 --> 20:35.625
Wait.

20:35.669 --> 20:36.887
More bouquets?

20:39.368 --> 20:40.891
[Charlie sneezes]

20:45.069 --> 20:46.984
Sorry it's so cramped in here.

20:47.028 --> 20:48.247
The wedding venue
needed these out

20:48.290 --> 20:49.465
and I had to scramble to find

20:49.509 --> 20:51.598
a place to store them
before donating them

20:51.641 --> 20:53.339
to the Senior Center
this weekend.

20:53.382 --> 20:54.557
Must have been quite the show.

20:54.601 --> 20:56.516
Yeah, the wedding was enormous.

20:56.559 --> 20:58.257
The bride and groom
really went all out

20:58.300 --> 20:59.258
on their celebrations.

21:01.129 --> 21:03.349
They wanted to find a way
to spread the love even more.

21:04.654 --> 21:07.266
[Charlie sneezes]

21:07.309 --> 21:08.136
Sorry.

21:11.008 --> 21:16.144
I guess you could say
I repurpose resources.

21:16.187 --> 21:17.406
It may seem small but,

21:17.450 --> 21:18.755

he had to sell it.

33:43.151 --> 33:47.155
But he used to run all kinds
of events in that space.

33:47.199 --> 33:48.809
Weddings my favorite, of course.

33:48.852 --> 33:50.071
Shocking.

33:50.115 --> 33:54.467
I want that space
to preserve love.

33:54.510 --> 33:55.816
And it's a way for my family

33:55.859 --> 33:57.644
to preserve something
special as well.

33:57.687 --> 33:59.167
When I first
started my business,

33:59.211 --> 34:00.995
I had to wait a few years
before I could afford the rent.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.824
But my ultimate goal
is to own it

34:03.867 --> 34:05.521
so that it stays in the family.

34:05.565 --> 34:08.307
I definitely know about
family and business.

34:08.350 --> 34:11.049
My uncle owns the real
estate firm I work for.

34:11.092 --> 34:12.311
That's complicated.

34:12.354 --> 34:14.052
Extremely.

34:14.095 --> 34:16.358
Just like everything
with Max and the wedding,

34:16.402 --> 34:19.013
and pretty much
all the stuff that

34:19.057 --> 34:21.276
comes with being
a parental figure.

34:22.669 --> 34:23.496
Yeah.

34:32.940 --> 34:34.246
Do you ever sleep?

34:34.289 --> 34:35.769
Have you met your uncle?

34:35.812 --> 34:37.771
Fair point. I stopped
by to see if I could help.

34:37.814 --> 34:39.120
If it's to help with
your warehouse property

34:39.164 --> 34:40.078
I wouldn't bother.

34:40.121 --> 34:41.731
Edward wants us to take a pause.

34:41.775 --> 34:42.645
Why is that?

34:42.689 --> 34:43.690
The issues keep piling up

34:43.733 --> 34:45.083
and I am bogged
down in paperwork

34:45.126 --> 34:47.215
and to be honest,
there are properties

34:47.259 --> 34:48.477
with a higher
return of investment

34:48.521 --> 34:49.739
that I should be focusing on.

34:49.783 --> 34:51.001
Where's the file?

34:51.045 --> 34:52.133
Let me work through it,
I'll get it closed.

34:52.177 --> 34:53.569
Yeah, Edward told us not to.

34:53.613 --> 34:54.831
Let me handle this.

34:54.875 --> 34:56.094
I'll talk to him.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.084
You're back!

35:30.128 --> 35:31.216
About time.

35:31.259 --> 35:32.347
You look terrible.

35:32.391 --> 35:33.914
All nighters will do that.

35:33.957 --> 35:36.395
You wanna tell me what you
should have told me earlier?

35:36.438 --> 35:38.223
I know it's a hairy situation,

35:38.266 --> 35:39.789
but I'm willing
to put in the hours.

35:39.833 --> 35:40.964
Not according to Max.

35:41.008 --> 35:41.922
What?

35:41.965 --> 35:43.489
Max told me the wedding is off.

35:43.532 --> 35:45.491
But everyone else seems to
think the wedding is still on.

35:45.534 --> 35:48.885
Uncle Edward, I need for
you to trust me on this.

35:48.929 --> 35:50.322
I have a plan.

35:50.365 --> 35:51.497
I trust you.

35:53.063 --> 35:53.847
You do?

35:53.890 --> 35:55.283
Yes.

35:55.327 --> 35:56.893
Because when you really put
your heart into something,

35:56.937 --> 35:58.373
there's no stopping you.

35:58.417 --> 36:01.159
If only that were true
of you and this company.

36:01.202 --> 36:03.422
Speaking of, I finished
and submitted the paperwork

36:03.465 --> 36:04.988
for the warehouse
on Meridian Street.

36:05.032 --> 36:06.207
The permit approval
should only take

36:06.251 --> 36:07.991
a couple of business days.

36:08.035 --> 36:09.428
I left Leopold with instructions

36:09.471 --> 36:11.560
in case there are any
curve balls during closing.

36:11.604 --> 36:13.214
What is it with this property?

36:13.258 --> 36:15.390
It's important to me.

36:15.434 --> 36:16.652
Just let me have this one.

36:16.696 --> 36:18.219
I specifically
put this one on hold.

36:18.263 --> 36:19.438
It is not moving forward.

36:19.481 --> 36:20.613
Why?

36:20.656 --> 36:22.789
Far too much risk,
for far too little gain.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.225
I don't see a reason why...

36:24.269 --> 36:26.401
Look, I make a lot of
exceptions for you, Charlie,

36:26.445 --> 36:29.012
this is not
gonna be one of them.

36:29.056 --> 36:30.536
My decision is final.

36:33.103 --> 36:34.844
We're gonna have a
long talk about this

36:34.888 --> 36:36.194
once you get back.

36:36.237 --> 36:38.544
Yes, we definitely are.

36:38.587 --> 36:39.893
Right now, I have
somewhere to be.

36:39.936 --> 36:41.286
Of course.

36:41.329 --> 36:43.418
And you are going to work
several weekends

36:43.462 --> 36:45.333
to make up for the time off.

36:45.377 --> 36:47.117
So everybody wins.

What's the occasion?

37:43.652 --> 37:44.479
What?

37:45.654 --> 37:50.180
It's professional to look cute.

37:50.224 --> 37:52.574
Well, I'm dropping
by because I received

37:52.618 --> 37:54.097
a phone call that
I think is for you.

37:54.141 --> 37:56.622
Something about a new buyer
for the warehouse.

37:56.665 --> 37:58.319
Oh don't worry, I have
someone helping me with that.

37:58.363 --> 37:59.973
Helping you out with what?

38:00.016 --> 38:01.366
The owner of the building
wants to sell

38:01.409 --> 38:02.932
so I need to be out in a week,

38:02.976 --> 38:05.413
but I think I found
a way for me to stay

38:05.457 --> 38:07.372
and maybe a rent to own.

38:07.415 --> 38:10.113
Honey, we have been down
this road a million times.

38:10.157 --> 38:11.376
It's the perfect space

38:11.419 --> 38:13.595
that needs to stay
in the family.

38:13.639 --> 38:16.555
Under that lady boss
and feisty exterior,

38:16.598 --> 38:19.471
your heart remains big and true.

38:20.689 --> 38:21.951
Oh look at you!

38:23.344 --> 38:25.520
Maybe it's time you share
it with someone new.

38:26.434 --> 38:27.522
I gotta go to work.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.357
Oh honey.

38:36.401 --> 38:37.315
I love you, Mom.

38:37.358 --> 38:38.751
I love you.

38:38.794 --> 38:41.144
There's no reason to feel guilt.

38:41.188 --> 38:43.756
It's just business.

38:43.799 --> 38:46.411
A business decision,
that's what business is.

38:46.454 --> 38:47.977
Not everybody wins.

38:49.414 --> 38:51.807
And maybe that's a
little unfair, but that's life.

38:51.851 --> 38:55.289
My uncle is never
going to change his mind.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.030
He's a tough business person.

38:57.073 --> 38:58.118
A smart one.

38:59.119 --> 39:01.382
We move forward
with other options.

39:01.426 --> 39:04.603
Goldenworth moves on,
I find Billie a new place,

39:04.646 --> 39:06.344
problem solved, life goes on,

39:06.387 --> 39:08.215
everyone is happy.

39:11.914 --> 39:12.915
Except Billie.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.136
Except me.

39:16.179 --> 39:17.485
Everything's gonna be fine.

39:18.443 --> 39:19.269
Right?

39:20.488 --> 39:21.837
[door creaking]

39:22.838 --> 39:25.014
I was wondering where
you two went off to.

39:25.058 --> 39:26.407
Come on Woof,
time for your walk!

39:26.451 --> 39:27.277
Come on!

39:32.326 --> 39:33.414
Ugh!

39:33.458 --> 39:34.676
The internet's out again.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.983
This place loses
signal every day.

39:37.026 --> 39:39.115
Looks like we have
to take a forced leave.

39:39.159 --> 39:40.378
Where should we have lunch?

39:40.421 --> 39:42.249
What are you in the mood for?
Thai, Mexican?

39:42.292 --> 39:44.643
No, no, we have
loads of work to do.

39:44.686 --> 39:46.819
Hey, why don't we go to your
office, it's close right?

39:46.862 --> 39:48.081
What? No!

39:48.908 --> 39:50.039
Yikes, okay.

39:50.083 --> 39:51.867
I'm sorry.

39:51.911 --> 39:53.652
I'm just really losing steam

39:53.695 --> 39:56.916
and I'm really starting
to worry about Max and Jess.

39:56.959 --> 39:58.352
And we only have
a few days left.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.223
All right, just breathe.

40:00.267 --> 40:01.442
Zen.

40:01.486 --> 40:02.400
You're hilarious.

40:03.618 --> 40:05.664
[phone beeping]

40:10.016 --> 40:12.540
A few days in and she
already prefers you to me.

40:12.584 --> 40:14.194
Can you blame her?

40:14.237 --> 40:15.761
This is me tapping out
and tapping you in.

40:15.804 --> 40:16.936
I'm out!

40:19.939 --> 40:20.896
As in, in.

40:20.940 --> 40:21.984
Cool!

40:22.028 --> 40:23.246
And if you're
gonna head to Jess,

40:23.290 --> 40:25.640
then I'll head to
the office after all.

40:25.684 --> 40:26.554
Okay!

40:32.299 --> 40:33.431
Oh, honey.

40:35.302 --> 40:36.782
I forgot all about it.

40:37.739 --> 40:39.698
Of course, the dress.

40:39.741 --> 40:40.786
Maybe we can return it.

40:40.829 --> 40:42.048
Did you still have the tags?

40:42.091 --> 40:43.528
No!

40:45.878 --> 40:50.230
That's the thing,
we can't return it.

40:50.273 --> 40:51.492
Okay.

40:51.536 --> 40:53.407
We can't because
it's custom made.

40:54.800 --> 40:57.150
Using the fabric
from Max's Mom's dress.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.763
See, I can
personalize things too.

41:01.807 --> 41:04.592
Not everything I do
is pitch perfect.

41:04.636 --> 41:06.638
I'm human, just
like everyone else.

41:09.989 --> 41:11.207
I miss her too, you know.

41:12.121 --> 41:13.688
She was like a mom to me, too.

41:15.516 --> 41:20.434
And when my own fiance questions
my willingness to honor her,

41:20.478 --> 41:22.262
it cuts like a knife.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.832
He may be a really
simple guy at heart,

41:26.875 --> 41:29.399
but this is complicated.

41:34.927 --> 41:36.189
I understand.

41:37.582 --> 41:38.539
I really do.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.542
I live every day wondering

41:41.586 --> 41:43.631
if I'm losing the
person closest to me

41:43.675 --> 41:45.285
even more than the day before.

41:47.722 --> 41:48.680
Really?

41:49.898 --> 41:51.073
I'm sorry.

41:51.117 --> 41:52.684
The point is,

41:52.727 --> 41:55.034
that we all need
to learn how to cope.

41:56.209 --> 41:57.863
And it isn't up to anyone else.

42:00.169 --> 42:02.955
Well, I guess the silver
lining in all of this

42:02.998 --> 42:04.609
is that we met
each other, right?

42:05.566 --> 42:07.481
I know I could have
called anybody today,

42:07.525 --> 42:11.572
but I just knew that you
would handle it the best.

42:11.616 --> 42:13.922
I'd really like
for us to be friends.

42:13.966 --> 42:15.228
I would like that, too.

42:21.713 --> 42:26.456
I think the right thing to do
is give Max the dress.

42:26.500 --> 42:27.675
What do you think?

42:29.068 --> 42:30.548
I think that's a great idea.

42:31.766 --> 42:34.769
But, why don't we
wait a few days?

42:34.813 --> 42:37.119
There's no need to
rush this right now.

42:38.294 --> 42:39.818
One foot in front of the other.

42:40.906 --> 42:42.037
One step at a time.

42:46.651 --> 42:51.612
And you absolutely have to
keep those or donate them.

42:52.874 --> 42:54.397
To me.

42:54.441 --> 42:56.008
They are perfect.

43:02.144 --> 43:03.885
[dog whining]

43:03.929 --> 43:05.713
I know, I know, Woof.

43:06.627 --> 43:08.586
We're gonna
figure it out, though.

43:08.629 --> 43:09.848
Just one more...

43:12.807 --> 43:14.374
property to try.

43:21.729 --> 43:23.339
Good boy!

43:25.515 --> 43:27.605
I think Jess is really
starting to reconsider.

43:27.648 --> 43:28.693
Same with Max.

43:30.999 --> 43:32.044
Hi, hi.

43:34.263 --> 43:35.090
Hi.

43:37.919 --> 43:39.660
I think Woof is on board too.

43:45.231 --> 43:46.841
You're seriously
running out of time.

43:46.885 --> 43:48.147
Hey, it's okay.

43:48.190 --> 43:49.757
The center said to
just bring them after six.

43:49.801 --> 43:51.193
Hey, no, yeah.

43:51.237 --> 43:52.542
Remember that time we were
trying to save the wedding?

43:52.586 --> 43:53.718
Yeah.

43:53.761 --> 43:55.937
No, we're at DEFCON 1 for sure.

43:55.981 --> 43:57.199
We're at DEFCON 5.

43:57.243 --> 43:59.114
Oh no, actually,
that's a common error

43:59.158 --> 44:02.074
because DEFCON 1 is
actually the most severe.

44:02.117 --> 44:03.684
Well at least we agree
it's the most severe.

44:03.728 --> 44:05.033
We're still running
out of options here.

44:05.077 --> 44:06.339
We only have a
few components left.

44:06.382 --> 44:07.949
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

44:07.993 --> 44:09.168
Now give me the binder.

44:11.736 --> 44:12.562
Think.

44:14.477 --> 44:18.481
Weddings are... beautiful.

44:18.525 --> 44:21.702
Weddings are... emotional.

44:21.746 --> 44:23.922
Weddings are...

44:23.965 --> 44:25.314
Experiential.

44:25.358 --> 44:26.141
Good one.

44:26.185 --> 44:27.447
Salesman.

44:27.490 --> 44:28.448
Right.

44:28.491 --> 44:29.318
Okay.

44:30.319 --> 44:33.322
Okay experiential, experience.

44:33.366 --> 44:35.368
Being there in the moment.

44:37.936 --> 44:40.547
Based on what we both
respectively just witnessed,

44:40.590 --> 44:42.505
Jess and Max are
far more susceptible

44:42.549 --> 44:43.724
to tearing down their walls

44:43.768 --> 44:45.160
when they're being
kind to one another,

44:45.204 --> 44:47.989
and then subsequently
getting sentimental.

44:48.033 --> 44:48.990
That's it.

44:49.034 --> 44:50.296
That's the key,
acts of kindness.

44:50.339 --> 44:52.428
They need to be
part of the experience.

44:52.472 --> 44:54.213
How about we get
them to participate

44:54.256 --> 44:56.650
in all of the
upcoming donations?

44:56.694 --> 44:57.520
Yes!

45:00.045 --> 45:02.047
We still gotta
do lip balm, so...

45:04.571 --> 45:06.051
More lip balm.

45:14.233 --> 45:15.321
[Clerk] Here you go.

45:16.148 --> 45:17.584
I think those
are the ones I made.

45:17.627 --> 45:18.759
Yes, I know.

45:19.629 --> 45:20.718
You two ready for this?

45:21.893 --> 45:22.894
Yes.

45:22.937 --> 45:24.330
It's going to a good cause.

45:36.646 --> 45:37.647
Okay.

45:39.867 --> 45:40.868
Okay, ready.

45:45.264 --> 45:47.179
- Hello.
- Thank you.

45:55.840 --> 45:58.103
Everyone, meet my parents!

45:58.146 --> 45:59.060
Hi.

45:59.887 --> 46:01.410
Sweetie pie!

46:02.368 --> 46:03.499
The couple came?

46:03.543 --> 46:05.414
Yeah, they wanted
to be here for this.

46:06.589 --> 46:09.027
But honestly, we're
both hoping that this

46:09.070 --> 46:10.419
might fix things between them.

46:10.463 --> 46:11.507
We?

46:11.551 --> 46:13.335
It's not what you're thinking.

46:14.162 --> 46:16.512
I'm not thinking anything
other than the outfit,

46:16.556 --> 46:18.514
the makeup,
the non-special occasion

46:18.558 --> 46:19.864
you were dolling up for.

46:19.907 --> 46:21.996
And I'm also not noticing
that the other half

46:22.040 --> 46:24.694
of this non-we
is quite handsome.

46:25.870 --> 46:29.264
So, we still get to eat
the cake today though, right?

46:29.308 --> 46:31.440
No matter what happens?

46:31.484 --> 46:32.572
Saul!

46:35.488 --> 46:37.446
Well uh, come on you two!

46:37.490 --> 46:40.145
Carol and I would love
to show you around.

46:40.188 --> 46:42.364
Mom, everyone else
in the rec room?

46:42.408 --> 46:44.018
You know it, Billie.

46:44.062 --> 46:44.889
Come on.

46:50.590 --> 46:51.634
Madame.

46:51.678 --> 46:54.246
[laughing]

46:54.289 --> 46:56.726
Cassie, this is Charlie.
Charlie, this is Cassie.

46:56.770 --> 46:57.597
Hi, Cassie.

46:59.904 --> 47:01.557
That's a pretty cool basketball.

47:01.601 --> 47:02.776
I love basketball.

47:04.169 --> 47:05.344
Let's pick teams.

47:06.867 --> 47:08.042
I'll start.

47:08.086 --> 47:10.305
I pick you.

47:10.349 --> 47:11.741
[laughing]

47:11.785 --> 47:12.917
Billie's gonna be on her own.

47:12.960 --> 47:14.919
You think we can take her?

47:14.962 --> 47:15.833
Yeah!

47:18.705 --> 47:19.706
It's on.

47:20.838 --> 47:21.882
You got it.

47:24.058 --> 47:26.017
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?

47:29.716 --> 47:30.804
Yes!

47:33.198 --> 47:36.679
And, he does this
clicking sound with his tongue

47:36.723 --> 47:38.290
every time he eats a sandwich!

47:38.333 --> 47:39.987
Drives me up the wall.

47:40.031 --> 47:42.076
Speaking of getting
driven up walls.

47:42.120 --> 47:44.818
How about when you
turn your cell phone off

47:44.862 --> 47:47.342
every time she ends a call.

47:47.386 --> 47:49.040
Why would I waste the battery?

47:51.085 --> 47:53.044
Oh you're dodging
a bullet, my friend.

47:56.830 --> 47:58.832
Who wants a lifetime
of this, huh?

48:00.225 --> 48:01.052
Oh.

48:02.140 --> 48:03.576
Yeah.

48:03.619 --> 48:04.925
It's the pits.

48:08.755 --> 48:12.715
Here's my very
unsolicited advice.

48:12.759 --> 48:13.978
Marriage is tough...

48:14.021 --> 48:17.895
But, real love is
worth fighting for.

48:27.426 --> 48:29.515
[laughing]

48:30.385 --> 48:31.169
No, no, no, no!

48:31.212 --> 48:32.387
Ow!

48:32.431 --> 48:33.258
Go!

48:34.824 --> 48:35.913
It was worth it!

48:38.176 --> 48:39.438
Hey, hey, hey!

48:39.481 --> 48:40.395
Foul! Foul!

48:40.439 --> 48:41.440
Did anyone see that?

48:41.483 --> 48:42.920
That was a foul.

48:44.008 --> 48:45.009
Fine, you win.

48:45.052 --> 48:47.576
- Yes!
- Yes!

48:47.620 --> 48:48.926
Good work.

48:48.969 --> 48:50.971
Can I ask you something, mister?

48:52.059 --> 48:55.454
Only if you promise to never,
ever call me mister again.

48:55.497 --> 48:56.934
What am I, old?

48:56.977 --> 48:58.239
Yeah, kind of.

48:58.283 --> 48:59.588
Fair enough.

48:59.632 --> 49:01.547
Why do you want
to play a kids game?

49:01.590 --> 49:03.201
Is it even fun for you?

49:04.942 --> 49:05.812
Are you kidding?

49:07.988 --> 49:08.946
Of course!

49:10.643 --> 49:11.992
Here's my thinking.

49:12.036 --> 49:15.953
No matter what I do,
or where I go,

49:15.996 --> 49:18.651
I want to enjoy every moment.

49:18.694 --> 49:20.392
Make every moment count.

49:23.830 --> 49:25.049
Life's short.

49:26.659 --> 49:28.139
I learned that this year.

49:28.182 --> 49:31.969
You gotta live every moment,
you know?

49:33.057 --> 49:34.406
Yeah, I guess.

49:40.325 --> 49:41.456
[Woman] Beautiful!

49:43.067 --> 49:45.939
Notice them putting it together?

49:45.983 --> 49:47.419
Together.

49:47.462 --> 49:48.986
Cut the cake!

49:49.029 --> 49:50.248
Cut the cake!

49:53.860 --> 49:54.861
Dad...

49:57.255 --> 49:58.299
Who wants cake?

49:59.692 --> 50:00.693
We all do, Dad.

50:01.737 --> 50:03.087
Let's do it.

50:03.130 --> 50:04.175
Yeah.

50:10.355 --> 50:13.271
[everyone laughing]

50:15.099 --> 50:17.797
I had no idea you
were dealing with this...

50:18.798 --> 50:21.018
issue, on top of
everything else.

50:22.410 --> 50:23.716
I'm really sorry.

50:23.759 --> 50:24.586
Thanks.

50:26.545 --> 50:28.025
It's a new normal.

50:28.068 --> 50:29.591
But we're optimistic.

50:29.635 --> 50:31.376
We just have to create
situations of stability

50:31.419 --> 50:34.596
and take him to places
that can jog good memories.

50:41.386 --> 50:43.475
Billie, we don't
need to do this.

50:43.518 --> 50:46.347
You don't need to worry
about Jess and Max.

50:46.391 --> 50:47.479
Thank you...

50:48.915 --> 50:50.525
It's a fun distraction.

50:50.569 --> 50:52.919
And right now, a necessary one.

50:52.962 --> 50:55.269
Besides, we are
running out of time.

50:56.140 --> 50:57.184
What's next?

50:57.228 --> 50:58.490
Not sure.

50:58.533 --> 51:00.448
I am sure this cake
is delicious though.

51:00.492 --> 51:01.493
More?

51:01.536 --> 51:02.885
No, enough sugar for me.

51:03.712 --> 51:05.975
Is it weird I can go for
an actual dinner, though?

51:06.019 --> 51:07.238
Always room for dinner.

51:10.980 --> 51:12.286
[together] Dinner.

51:14.158 --> 51:16.073
We conveniently
know just the place.

51:22.601 --> 51:24.516
I love this place!

51:24.559 --> 51:26.518
I can see now why you
chose it for the catering.

51:26.561 --> 51:27.780
Did you know that years ago,

51:27.823 --> 51:29.129
it was gonna be turned
into a parking lot?

51:29.173 --> 51:30.913
Really?
How'd you know?

51:30.957 --> 51:32.132
I'm actually on the junior board

51:32.176 --> 51:34.091
of the Bellingham
Historical Society.

51:34.134 --> 51:36.571
One day in a meeting, in
walks this guy named Vinnie...

51:36.615 --> 51:38.921
And this one helped
save the day.

51:38.965 --> 51:39.792
Vinnie!

51:41.446 --> 51:43.535
Man, that was years ago!

51:43.578 --> 51:45.841
Then we had our first date here.

51:45.885 --> 51:48.409
Oh, and do you remember
how hard it was raining?

51:48.453 --> 51:49.715
I almost canceled.

51:49.758 --> 51:51.630
I'm sorry to hear
about everything,

51:51.673 --> 51:52.848
you're breaking my heart.

51:52.892 --> 51:55.503
But I guess we
should just get to it.

51:55.547 --> 51:57.157

You never really
mentioned why you

52:46.728 --> 52:48.295
got into this line of work.

52:48.339 --> 52:50.341
I was engaged once.

52:50.384 --> 52:51.472
Real or imaginary?

52:51.516 --> 52:53.866
Real, thanks.

52:53.909 --> 52:55.172
Very real.

52:55.215 --> 52:57.565
Nah, he called it off
before the wedding.

52:57.609 --> 52:59.524
And all that stuff
just went to waste.

52:59.567 --> 53:02.483
And then I started to notice
that every wedding I went to,

53:02.527 --> 53:04.311
every one my parents did,

53:04.355 --> 53:06.661
all of those beautiful things

53:06.705 --> 53:09.316
that were intended
to celebrate love

53:09.360 --> 53:11.623
were just being discarded.

53:12.580 --> 53:15.844
So, I wanted to find a new way

53:15.888 --> 53:19.544
to share that love with
people that really needed it.

53:19.587 --> 53:22.024
Strange way to cope,
but here we are.

53:23.722 --> 53:25.463
I'm really sorry, Billie.

53:25.506 --> 53:26.333
Don't be.

53:27.334 --> 53:28.509
It was a long time ago.

53:28.553 --> 53:31.164
But I'm not sorry for
where it brought you.

53:31.208 --> 53:33.775
What you do is amazing.

53:33.819 --> 53:38.824
You're smart, and sweet,
and so beautiful.

53:39.868 --> 53:40.695
And...

53:42.610 --> 53:44.699
I care about you.

53:51.445 --> 53:53.578
I care about you, too.

53:58.670 --> 54:00.846
[Jess and Max laughing]

54:02.587 --> 54:03.849
Oh my god.

54:03.892 --> 54:05.416
Hey, thanks for letting
me try the Bolognese.

54:05.459 --> 54:07.461
It's not as good
as the carbonara.

54:07.505 --> 54:09.811
Yeah, so what's
on tap for tomorrow?

54:09.855 --> 54:11.248
Yeah, what are we doing next?

54:19.734 --> 54:22.259
So, am I getting
my tux out or not?

54:22.302 --> 54:24.391
Keep it ready,
everything's looking good.

54:24.435 --> 54:25.697
Fantastic.

54:25.740 --> 54:27.089
Listen, I wanna talk to you

54:27.133 --> 54:28.569
about the Meridian
Street warehouse.

54:28.613 --> 54:31.268
Good timing, we actually
decided yesterday

54:31.311 --> 54:33.052
to move forward on it.

54:33.095 --> 54:35.097
You're kidding me, great.

54:35.141 --> 54:36.708
What made you change your mind?

54:36.751 --> 54:38.231
Large profit margins.

54:39.276 --> 54:41.582
Leopold came up with
a model that works.

54:41.626 --> 54:44.672
We tear it down, build
luxury condos in its place.

54:44.716 --> 54:47.545
Huge upside in five to 10 years.

54:47.588 --> 54:48.937
I don't understand.

54:48.981 --> 54:51.200
Every lavish feature a
high-rise condo can offer.

54:51.244 --> 54:53.072
The showers will be
equipped with speakers

54:53.115 --> 54:55.292
that will play music and
sounds of the amazon jungle.

54:55.335 --> 54:57.555
You had no right to make that
deal without consulting me.

54:57.598 --> 54:59.774
I promised the current
tenant a rent-to-own lease.

54:59.818 --> 55:01.907
To consult you?
You're never here!

55:01.950 --> 55:03.169
And this is my business.

55:03.212 --> 55:04.475
Someone very important to me

55:04.518 --> 55:06.259
has a lot invested
in that property.

55:06.303 --> 55:08.087
They'll have their
chance to outbid us.

55:08.130 --> 55:09.131
She can't afford to.

55:09.175 --> 55:10.568
Even better.

55:10.611 --> 55:12.657
This is business, end of story.

55:13.484 --> 55:14.789
But we're family!

55:16.269 --> 55:19.141
And you need to learn when
to pick your battles, hmm?

55:19.185 --> 55:20.621
You still got a lot
to learn, Charlie.

55:20.665 --> 55:23.624
And remember who picked up
the pieces for you, okay.

55:23.668 --> 55:24.930
Life isn't easy.

55:24.973 --> 55:27.976
We don't always get
to choose our paths.

55:28.020 --> 55:30.631
But you stepped into a role
you need to see through.

55:30.675 --> 55:31.502
Got it?

55:34.374 --> 55:36.333
What was originally
intended to transport

55:36.376 --> 55:38.509
the bridal party from
the church to the reception

55:38.552 --> 55:41.555
is now being used
as a spiffy way

55:41.599 --> 55:43.427
to bring some much
needed volunteers,

55:43.470 --> 55:45.167
thank you guys for this,

55:45.211 --> 55:47.518
to a truly wonderful
soup kitchen.

55:47.561 --> 55:48.606
Okay, let's go!

Paliotti's restaurant.

56:02.663 --> 56:04.535

on the west coast.

56:07.233 --> 56:11.455
I'm having so much fun,
I can do this every day.

56:11.498 --> 56:14.501
[people chattering]

56:21.160 --> 56:22.204
That'll do it.

56:22.248 --> 56:23.162
A job well done.

56:25.077 --> 56:27.296
Yeah, I guess we should go.

56:27.340 --> 56:29.429
Oh, okay.

56:29.473 --> 56:30.691
Yeah.

56:30.735 --> 56:31.823
Walk you home?

56:33.955 --> 56:35.043
I'd like that.

56:40.658 --> 56:41.528
Walk you home?

56:44.270 --> 56:45.576
I'd like that.

56:52.844 --> 56:55.107
Your parents for the win,
by the way.

56:55.150 --> 56:56.369
That was a real turning point.

56:56.413 --> 56:57.239
Yeah, totally.

56:57.283 --> 56:58.415
And Vinnie.

56:58.458 --> 56:59.633
Everyone's been so great.

57:01.330 --> 57:05.465
Hey... do you think what
we're doing is right?

57:05.509 --> 57:06.727
What do you mean?

57:06.771 --> 57:08.381
They're so clearly meant to be.

57:08.425 --> 57:09.251
No, no, not that.

57:09.295 --> 57:10.427
It's just...

57:12.385 --> 57:13.604
I feel bad.

57:13.647 --> 57:15.736
Manipulating the situation,
you know?

57:15.780 --> 57:18.870
We're just creating situations
for them to be together.

57:18.913 --> 57:20.785
They could easily walk,
but they aren't.

57:20.828 --> 57:23.614
They wanna be together,
just look at today.

57:23.657 --> 57:24.745
Yeah.

57:25.746 --> 57:27.182
Yeah, you're right.

57:27.226 --> 57:31.230
Besides, it's not like we're
lying to them or anything.

57:31.273 --> 57:32.100
You okay?

57:33.493 --> 57:34.842
Yeah...

57:34.886 --> 57:35.800
Of course.

57:44.156 --> 57:45.679
Hey, good boy.

57:46.332 --> 57:47.464

58:17.537 --> 58:18.625
You're uncle is in a meeting.

58:18.669 --> 58:19.931
I don't care.

58:19.974 --> 58:21.323
You're not gonna
destroy the warehouse.

58:21.367 --> 58:23.587
Listen: I like you, Charlie.

58:23.630 --> 58:26.459
I always have, but you
really need to take a breath.

58:26.503 --> 58:28.417
Frankly, this is none
of your business, Leopold.

58:28.461 --> 58:30.202
It is my business.

58:30.245 --> 58:32.117
Every time you leave,
I have to pick up your slack,

58:32.160 --> 58:34.162
and your uncle gives
you pass after pass

58:34.206 --> 58:36.817
and I get it, you're family.

58:36.861 --> 58:39.777
But as a colleague and
someone I've come to respect,

58:39.820 --> 58:41.518
you really need to let this go.

58:41.561 --> 58:43.650
This is bigger than
margins and risks.

58:43.694 --> 58:46.218
Margins and risks are
your uncle's whole company.

58:47.524 --> 58:49.438
Look man, all I'm trying to do

58:49.482 --> 58:51.615
is help you from making
a really stupid move.

58:51.658 --> 58:53.181
I get it, I really do,

58:53.225 --> 58:55.140
but I made a promise
to someone I care about

58:55.183 --> 58:57.838
and I'm not just
gonna go back on that.

58:57.882 --> 58:58.883
It's already done.

59:00.232 --> 59:01.842
Is there really no
way to reverse this?

59:02.756 --> 59:03.844
The wheel's already turning.

59:03.888 --> 59:05.716
What am I supposed to tell her?

59:05.759 --> 59:11.939
You could tell her to her face,
that you've been lying to her.

59:11.983 --> 59:13.593
This whole time.

59:13.637 --> 59:15.595
Billie, what are you doing here?

59:15.639 --> 59:17.031
It doesn't matter.

59:17.075 --> 59:18.424
Billie, I tried.

59:20.513 --> 59:22.036
This is worse than lying.

59:24.082 --> 59:25.344
This is deceit.

59:29.957 --> 59:32.177
You must've known their plans
and just kept them from me.

59:32.220 --> 59:33.961
No, I did everything I could

59:34.005 --> 59:36.007
but this was about
profit for my uncle...

59:36.050 --> 59:37.748
This is so typical of you.

59:37.791 --> 59:40.272
Just pass the buck and
not take any of the blame.

opening up to you.

59:44.711 --> 59:45.799

59:47.932 --> 59:51.239
I was wrong about you, Charlie.

59:51.283 --> 59:53.720
I was wrong about everything.

1:00:04.339 --> 1:00:05.645
You're going after her, right?

1:00:18.353 --> 1:00:20.007
I know you hate my guts.

1:00:20.051 --> 1:00:21.748

1:00:21.792 --> 1:00:22.749
I don't hate you.

1:00:24.055 --> 1:00:26.710
I hate your arrogance,

1:00:26.753 --> 1:00:29.843
and your deceit,
and your stubborn nature.

1:00:32.759 --> 1:00:34.456

1:00:34.500 --> 1:00:36.110
you really have a lot
of gall coming here.

I apologize for
all those things,

1:00:39.374 --> 1:00:41.072
but more importantly,
we have an agreement.

1:00:41.115 --> 1:00:43.727
And I'm not gonna bail on that.

1:00:43.770 --> 1:00:45.816

see Jess and Max together,

1:07:16.684 --> 1:07:18.947
the reason you
won't let anyone in,

1:07:18.991 --> 1:07:21.776
the reason you feel
like nothing works out,

1:07:21.820 --> 1:07:23.082
the reason you feel bailed on,

1:07:23.126 --> 1:07:24.823
the reason you don't trust...

1:07:27.086 --> 1:07:29.132
is because idiots
like me make you feel

1:07:29.175 --> 1:07:32.048
like you're not the
incredible woman you are.

1:07:33.614 --> 1:07:35.051
Even though it's
impossible for you

1:07:35.094 --> 1:07:37.053
to be anything less than magic.

1:07:40.099 --> 1:07:41.796
And nothing will
ever change that.

1:07:43.929 --> 1:07:47.585
And I know life still happens,
like with your father,

1:07:47.628 --> 1:07:51.893

will bring him home.

or how anxious you feel,

Hey, I knew you'd be up.

1:11:32.331 --> 1:11:35.073
Listen, I know you're crazy busy

1:11:35.116 --> 1:11:37.162
but I have a small
favor to ask you.

1:11:39.643 --> 1:11:40.948
Hi!

1:11:40.992 --> 1:11:41.819
Hello!

1:11:44.038 --> 1:11:44.865
Hello!

1:11:46.171 --> 1:11:48.173
The structure was
constructed in the 1900's.

1:11:48.216 --> 1:11:50.001
Years later my
grandfather acquired it

1:11:50.044 --> 1:11:51.655
and then eventually
my dad inherited it

1:11:51.698 --> 1:11:53.396
and turned it into a
successful event space

1:11:53.439 --> 1:11:55.136
for many years.

1:11:55.180 --> 1:11:57.356
Do you have
archival documentation

1:11:57.400 --> 1:11:58.792
about the history
of this building?

1:11:58.836 --> 1:12:00.228
Yes, in my presentation...

1:12:00.272 --> 1:12:02.622
Only some structural elements

1:12:02.666 --> 1:12:04.711
of this historical
building still exist.

1:12:04.755 --> 1:12:05.712
Isn't that right?

1:12:05.756 --> 1:12:06.583
Yes... that's right.

1:12:11.501 --> 1:12:15.592
The foundation was laid in 1909,
the walls went up in 1910.

1:12:15.635 --> 1:12:17.855
A fire destroyed much
of the interior in 1940,

1:12:17.898 --> 1:12:20.118
but was restored
the following year.

1:12:22.860 --> 1:12:26.646
But those are just facts, right?

1:12:29.519 --> 1:12:31.956
What I came to do here today,

1:12:31.999 --> 1:12:34.480
and the reason this emergency
meeting came together

1:12:34.524 --> 1:12:36.700
is more about memory.

1:12:37.918 --> 1:12:39.485
And the memories
that people will get

1:12:39.529 --> 1:12:41.400
from knowing that
their celebratory items

1:12:41.444 --> 1:12:44.838
will spread love
to those in need.

1:12:44.882 --> 1:12:47.188
And the feeling that
comes from sharing

1:12:47.232 --> 1:12:48.451
that celebration of love

1:12:48.494 --> 1:12:53.281
in a city they love,
in a space they love.

1:12:55.458 --> 1:12:57.895
The foundation of this
building still exists.

1:12:59.375 --> 1:13:00.201
But...

1:13:02.465 --> 1:13:05.642
isn't that what love is
built on in the first place?

1:13:05.685 --> 1:13:07.818
We all have to start somewhere.

1:13:07.861 --> 1:13:09.036
And with your help...

1:13:12.126 --> 1:13:13.084
I wanna start here.

1:13:25.096 --> 1:13:26.576
[Woof barking]

1:13:26.619 --> 1:13:28.882
Hey, what do you have here?

1:13:36.107 --> 1:13:37.195
Yes.

1:13:37.238 --> 1:13:38.022
No.

1:13:38.065 --> 1:13:38.892
Wait, no.

1:13:41.025 --> 1:13:42.243
Okay fine.

1:13:42.287 --> 1:13:44.376
But I am only going
to support Max and Jess.

1:13:45.769 --> 1:13:47.248
[phone beeping]

1:13:51.905 --> 1:13:53.777
Hey, Billie.

1:13:53.820 --> 1:13:55.692
I've done a lot of
things that I regret.

1:13:55.735 --> 1:13:58.956
Give me the chance to
explain in person tonight.

1:13:58.999 --> 1:14:00.305
Please, Billie.

1:14:00.348 --> 1:14:01.915
Woof already RSVP'd
that you'd be there

1:14:01.959 --> 1:14:03.351
so don't stand him up, too.

1:14:04.309 --> 1:14:05.789
You did, did you?

1:14:33.251 --> 1:14:34.861
Hey man, thanks for coming.

1:14:49.659 --> 1:14:50.486
Wow.

1:14:53.358 --> 1:14:54.315
You came!

1:14:55.403 --> 1:14:56.579
Here I am.

1:14:57.580 --> 1:14:58.537
Thank you.

1:14:59.582 --> 1:15:01.932
We all thank you.

1:15:05.196 --> 1:15:09.156
Listen, I know I
can't fix everything.

1:15:09.200 --> 1:15:12.029
I know because I actually
tried and I failed.

1:15:14.422 --> 1:15:16.512
So let me start by apologizing.

1:15:18.949 --> 1:15:20.385
I'm sorry I lied.

1:15:21.342 --> 1:15:22.518
I'm sorry I didn't come clean

1:15:22.561 --> 1:15:24.868
and I'm really sorry
for what's about

1:15:24.911 --> 1:15:26.304
to happen to this building.

1:15:29.437 --> 1:15:31.352
I know that when I
try to control things,

1:15:31.396 --> 1:15:33.746
there are repercussions
for my actions.

1:15:34.617 --> 1:15:35.487
Real ones.

1:15:36.836 --> 1:15:41.972
Ones that affect people
and their emotions

1:15:42.015 --> 1:15:43.321
and ones that affect you.

1:15:44.714 --> 1:15:47.673
And that breaks my heart
more than anything.

1:15:47.717 --> 1:15:48.544
Because...

1:15:51.242 --> 1:15:52.852
well, I've fallen
for you, Billie.

1:15:57.204 --> 1:15:58.466
That's the truth.

1:16:01.469 --> 1:16:03.123
Even though I can't fix this...

1:16:04.298 --> 1:16:05.909
I can do my best
to make it better.

1:16:06.779 --> 1:16:12.568
We can all enjoy this space
one last time.

1:16:12.611 --> 1:16:13.656
Together.

1:16:14.874 --> 1:16:17.398
The way it was always
meant to be enjoyed.

1:16:19.270 --> 1:16:21.272
With a very special
celebration of love.

1:16:35.982 --> 1:16:36.809
Jess...

1:16:39.507 --> 1:16:45.383
I give you this ring
as a symbol of my love.

1:16:45.426 --> 1:16:49.082
And as it encircles your finger,
may it remind you always

1:16:49.126 --> 1:16:51.345
that you are surrounded
by my enduring love.

1:16:52.303 --> 1:16:53.521
I will wear it gladly.

1:16:56.133 --> 1:16:56.960

1:16:58.222 --> 1:17:00.920
I give you this ring
as a symbol of my love.

1:17:00.964 --> 1:17:02.618
As it encircles your finger,

1:17:02.661 --> 1:17:05.098
