00:00.001 --> 00:03.469
<i>Previously on</i> Teen Wolf...

00:03.471 --> 00:05.170
Scott! Help me! No, no!

00:06.840 --> 00:08.039
So, what's the plan then?

00:08.042 --> 00:09.608
I'm goin' through the portal.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.110
Who's Peter?
My dad.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.378
He has something.

00:13.546 --> 00:15.147
Stiles, is this you?

00:15.149 --> 00:17.049
<i>Alright, just remember this.</i>

00:17.051 --> 00:18.450
<i>We're comin' to get you.</i>

00:18.452 --> 00:20.686
<i>No, you can't.
You won't be able to find me.</i>

01:19.846 --> 01:21.180
Hello?

01:24.451 --> 01:25.517
Wait!

03:12.959 --> 03:15.060
It's not real!

03:15.062 --> 03:16.962
Not real!

03:16.964 --> 03:18.230
It's not real!

03:18.731 --> 03:19.798
It's not...

04:13.519 --> 04:16.454
All right. You heard a voice
coming through the radio,

04:16.457 --> 04:18.857
and now you're convinced
that it's the voice of...

04:18.858 --> 04:20.993
Stiles. Your son.

04:23.196 --> 04:26.498
Uh-huh. And maybe it's just
a random signal cross?

04:28.635 --> 04:30.269
Peter gave us
the keys to the Jeep

04:30.271 --> 04:33.038
and it started right up.
Claudia's Jeep.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.941
Oh, wait, wait, so, now I'm
supposed to trust Peter hale?

04:35.943 --> 04:37.542
I want you to trust me.

04:37.544 --> 04:40.312
I heard stiles on that radio,
I'm sure of it.

04:40.314 --> 04:41.880
- If you had heard it too...
- Well, I didn't.

04:41.882 --> 04:46.852
Yeah. But if you had...
Enough, Scott! Enough.

04:51.891 --> 04:53.292
<i>You saw a carousel?</i>

04:53.294 --> 04:54.559
And a big sign
that said "Canaan."

04:54.561 --> 04:56.995
And people disappearing
in clouds of smoke.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.463
Do you ever have nice dreams?

04:59.966 --> 05:02.401
We need to go to Canaan.

05:02.403 --> 05:05.237
It will be helpful if we knew
anything about the place.

05:05.239 --> 05:07.739
I keep calling the number for city hall,
and no one answers.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.876
The only map I can find
it on is 30 years old.

05:12.478 --> 05:16.348
So far, the only thing I know
about Canaan is where it is.

05:18.918 --> 05:20.385
That's all we need to know.

05:22.955 --> 05:25.090
Scott, Malia and Lydia
are going out to Canaan.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.993
He said to go through with the plan
as long as it doesn't destroy his house.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.594
What plan?

05:29.596 --> 05:30.762
Your plan.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.031
Well, you said you had
all these ideas about

05:33.033 --> 05:34.099
how to catch a ghost rider.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.767
I had one idea.
It was pretty bad.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.436
And then I had another
really bad idea.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.371
Anything that could work?

05:39.373 --> 05:40.439
Yeah, but it's terrible.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.040
Great. Let's do it.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.140
We need to break

05:43.164 --> 05:44.142
into the faculty storage room.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.720
To save the whole town

05:45.745 --> 05:48.037
from ghost riders? No problem.

06:01.828 --> 06:02.961
It's spreading, isn't it?

06:03.529 --> 06:04.796
You don't wanna know.

06:08.634 --> 06:11.570
Uh, how did a whip do this?

06:12.405 --> 06:14.873
It was a ghost rider's whip.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.843
Well, the regular doctors think
that they can surgically remove

06:17.845 --> 06:20.512
You're scheduled for
emergency surgery in an hour.

06:22.316 --> 06:24.616
Hey... hey...

06:25.585 --> 06:27.452
Wait!
Where are you going?

06:29.856 --> 06:31.490
It's a supernatural toxin.

06:31.492 --> 06:34.326
If they try to cut it out,
it will spread.

06:37.864 --> 06:39.498
Tell me what you need.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.567
I can't go in
the operating room.

06:44.504 --> 06:46.571
I won't come out alive.

06:51.511 --> 06:53.612
Then we gotta get you
out of here.

07:03.122 --> 07:04.423
Where are we?

07:05.358 --> 07:07.426
According to the GPS,
this is it.

07:30.416 --> 07:31.683
This is it.

07:32.485 --> 07:33.985
Canaan's a ghost town.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.301
I don't hear a single heartbeat.

07:49.303 --> 07:50.969
I'm not catching any scents.

07:53.606 --> 07:55.474
I wonder why stiles
would send us here.

08:13.526 --> 08:15.660
This is the place
I saw in the mirror.

09:13.386 --> 09:17.389
Uh, tell doctor Geyer they
wanted to do a few more tests

09:17.391 --> 09:19.491
before surgery.

09:19.493 --> 09:21.860
If he even asks.

09:21.862 --> 09:25.263
He probably won't.
But if he does ask, tell him that.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.016
Mom? Kylie?

10:08.074 --> 10:09.975
Is that your adoptive family?

10:15.414 --> 10:18.416
I know what you're thinking.
You should've died with them.

10:19.553 --> 10:20.819
Let me help you with that.

11:00.192 --> 11:01.259
Do you have the list?

11:01.961 --> 11:03.328
It's in my head.

11:03.330 --> 11:07.032
What if you forget something?
Is that a good idea?

11:07.034 --> 11:08.767
If we get caught
stealing school supplies,

11:08.769 --> 11:10.035
it's a great idea.

11:12.304 --> 11:13.371
Okay, now.

11:22.782 --> 11:24.683
Can't we just buy
a lightning rod?

11:25.284 --> 11:27.352
Sure, if you've got $2500.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.434
What are you doing here?

11:43.803 --> 11:45.670
This is faculty only.

11:45.672 --> 11:47.405
Then why are you
the one leaving?

11:47.407 --> 11:49.340
What are you doing?

11:49.342 --> 11:52.010
Plugs and wires?
Are... are you making a taser?

11:52.012 --> 11:54.379
No. No, of course not.

11:56.315 --> 11:57.382
You saw them, didn't you?

11:58.217 --> 11:59.150
You should be in class.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.819
Was it the night
of the lacrosse game?

12:02.321 --> 12:04.789
You saw the lightning,
the men, and the horses?

12:06.759 --> 12:08.059
Dozens of them.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.128
Then what?

12:11.063 --> 12:12.130
It was chaos.

12:13.365 --> 12:15.400
They were everywhere.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.535
Some of the kids were running.

12:17.537 --> 12:20.872
But for everyone else it,
it was like there was nothing there.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.274
They couldn't see a thing.

12:24.610 --> 12:26.411
We did.

12:26.413 --> 12:30.248
And we've got a lot more to tell you
if you really wanna fight back.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.862
Hello?

12:52.571 --> 12:53.838
Hey!

13:01.413 --> 13:02.480
Mom?

13:18.798 --> 13:21.132
It's okay, your mom's not here.

13:23.502 --> 13:24.803
You're okay.

13:25.571 --> 13:26.805
I saw her.

13:27.740 --> 13:28.973
And her head,

13:30.342 --> 13:32.302
looked like somebody
took a bite out of her skull.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.012
It wasn't real.

13:34.914 --> 13:36.447
Yeah, but it felt real.

13:36.449 --> 13:39.751
The energy here,
it's causing hallucinations.

13:39.753 --> 13:41.319
We can't stay here.

13:41.321 --> 13:41.971
We can't leave.

13:41.996 --> 13:43.922
Not until we figure out
why stiles sent us here.

13:43.924 --> 13:46.791
Who are we going to ask?
There's no one here.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.059
We can ask him.

13:51.931 --> 13:52.997
Hey!

13:55.100 --> 13:56.267
What do we do?

13:56.269 --> 13:57.335
Go after him!

14:11.283 --> 14:14.552
I think we both know that this
medication isn't gonna work, either.

14:15.721 --> 14:17.889
So I'm open for suggestions.

14:17.891 --> 14:21.292
I had an idea,
but it's asking a lot.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.662
Asking more than risking my job

14:24.664 --> 14:26.264
by losing a patient
in this hospital?

14:28.167 --> 14:32.804
It's the nine herbs.
They counteract nine supernatural venoms.

14:32.806 --> 14:34.973
If the herbs are combined
in the wrong way,

14:34.975 --> 14:38.209
it increases the venom's power.

14:39.478 --> 14:42.313
So if I screw up...
You'll kill me.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.287
Can you talk me through it?

14:50.322 --> 14:51.823
Yeah, I can try.

14:51.825 --> 14:53.491
Well, we don't have a choice.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.161
You don't have much time.

14:58.497 --> 15:01.666
Okay, what are they?

15:01.668 --> 15:04.402
I only know the names in Celtic.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.205
Okay.

15:07.207 --> 15:11.910
First one is <i> mugwort.</i>

15:13.112 --> 15:14.612
I'm gonna need you
to spell that.

15:14.614 --> 15:15.914
Yeah.

15:47.413 --> 15:48.513
Hello?

15:57.423 --> 15:58.489
Anybody here?

16:05.898 --> 16:07.198
Visitors?

16:08.934 --> 16:11.369
I can't believe
we have visitors.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.175
Oh, Caleb will be
so happy to see you.

16:17.177 --> 16:20.511
It's been such a long time since
he's had anyone to play with.

16:22.147 --> 16:23.982
Oh, you must be thirsty.

16:25.317 --> 16:28.987
Come on in and have a seat while
I get you something to drink.

16:30.789 --> 16:33.424
Seriously?
What is with her?

16:33.426 --> 16:36.561
She's the woman
I saw in the mirror.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.167
<i>Mugwort</i>

16:43.969 --> 16:45.703
<i>mugwort.</i>
That sounds so familiar.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.376
Hmm, of course.
It's prescribed for anxiety.

16:51.378 --> 16:54.012
Most of these herbs
are used in modern drugs.

16:54.014 --> 16:57.949
So, between raiding the hospital pharmacy,
the homeopath downtown

16:57.951 --> 16:59.617
and the salad bar,

16:59.619 --> 17:01.352
I think I can find them all.

17:01.354 --> 17:04.989
Yeah. I'm gonna be back
as soon as I can.

17:04.991 --> 17:07.258
You try to stay awake.

17:10.628 --> 17:13.631
Mil... I'm right here.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.067
Mil... you have to add...

17:16.801 --> 17:18.536
You have to add...

17:19.338 --> 17:22.140
What? What do
I have to add?

17:25.377 --> 17:26.577
The lightning strikes the rod,

17:26.579 --> 17:28.713
which sends the bolt
down into the tunnel.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.249
We grab the ghost rider
push him into the bunker,

17:32.184 --> 17:33.484
and we trap him there.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.887
Okay.

17:35.889 --> 17:38.322
How do you keep him from riding
the lightning back out of the tunnels

17:38.324 --> 17:39.824
before you get him
into the trap?

17:39.826 --> 17:42.994
Well, if the lightning strikes again,
it'll just hit our rod.

17:42.996 --> 17:44.195
He won't be close enough
to grab on.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.430
But, shouldn't we assume
the ghost riders

17:45.432 --> 17:47.732
have some kind of control
over where it strikes?

17:51.737 --> 17:54.205
Just because physics
can't explain it today

17:54.207 --> 17:57.608
doesn't mean there won't be
a logical explanation tomorrow.

17:57.610 --> 18:01.746
So, if they have control,
then how do we stop 'em?

18:03.248 --> 18:05.450
We need to absorb
a lightning bolt.

18:06.018 --> 18:07.852
Can we do that?

18:07.854 --> 18:09.420
Not with anything we have here.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.922
I can't build
a conduit strong enough

18:10.924 --> 18:12.790
to absorb even
half that much energy.

18:17.629 --> 18:20.598
Instead of a conduit, maybe we can
find a person to absorb the lightning.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.266
I don't even think Kira
could do that.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.535
Josh could.
He ate electricity.

18:24.537 --> 18:25.536
Josh is dead.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.305
Yeah, but his power
didn't die with him.

18:27.307 --> 18:30.108
May as well have.
We can't get to it.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.376
We don't know that.
Not for sure.

18:34.146 --> 18:35.947
What are you saying?

18:35.949 --> 18:38.316
You know what I'm saying.

18:38.318 --> 18:41.619
If you're saying what I think
you're saying, you're insane.

18:41.621 --> 18:42.687
I know it's insane.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.290
But I need you with me on this.

18:54.566 --> 18:58.169
This was my mother's
lemonade recipe.

18:58.171 --> 19:01.139
At least as much as I can remember.

19:01.141 --> 19:04.809
We always served this
when we had friends to visit.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.083
We didn't come to visit.
We're looking for someone.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.086
A friend of ours.

19:15.088 --> 19:17.755
Maybe you've seen him.
His name is stiles?

19:17.757 --> 19:20.658
It's been a while since
anyone came through Canaan.

19:21.493 --> 19:22.560
How long?

19:26.765 --> 19:29.667
Since April 8th, 1987?

19:32.638 --> 19:35.840
Why would you disturb those things?
They don't belong to you.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.175
We need to know what happened.

19:38.210 --> 19:40.878
There was a picnic.
A community party.

19:42.314 --> 19:45.049
It seems like everyone
left in a hurry.

19:45.051 --> 19:46.931
People have been leaving
Canaan for a long time.

19:48.287 --> 19:49.727
That's the day
the last of them left.

19:51.456 --> 19:54.959
All at once? They all
just disappeared?

19:54.961 --> 19:57.862
I didn't say they disappeared.
I said they left.

20:00.499 --> 20:03.734
Did they leave in a
cloud of green smoke?

20:03.736 --> 20:04.802
They just left!

20:13.545 --> 20:14.946
We didn't mean to upset you.

20:18.717 --> 20:19.784
We'll go now.

20:32.197 --> 20:33.598
No one is leaving.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.635
No one is leaving Canaan

20:38.070 --> 20:39.470
ever again.

20:49.948 --> 20:52.950
I think the last thing that you were
trying to say was my name.

20:54.019 --> 20:55.253
You said,

20:56.355 --> 20:58.489
"Mel, you need to add..."

21:00.759 --> 21:01.826
Wait.

21:03.362 --> 21:05.229
Since when
do you call me "Mel?"

21:05.231 --> 21:06.631
Since when do you use
a nickname for anybody?

21:06.633 --> 21:09.467
You don't even use
your own first name.

21:09.469 --> 21:10.768
Everybody calls you argent.

21:11.703 --> 21:12.770
You...

21:13.572 --> 21:14.705
You weren't trying
to say my name,

21:14.707 --> 21:16.067
you were saying
something in Celtic

21:19.278 --> 21:20.878
Of course.

21:26.585 --> 21:28.619
Scott, open the door,
you're a werewolf.

21:28.621 --> 21:29.720
I'm trying.

21:44.236 --> 21:45.903
What the hell is wrong
with this place?

21:48.240 --> 21:52.343
Lenore? Could you
unlock the door, please?

21:52.345 --> 21:55.713
Now that you're here,
you need to stay.

21:57.783 --> 21:58.849
Caleb likes you.

22:01.653 --> 22:02.720
And we like him.

22:07.192 --> 22:08.993
But we need to help our town.

22:08.995 --> 22:13.331
People are disappearing,
uh, leaving, I mean leaving.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.032
You could really help us.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.434
No one can help you.

22:16.436 --> 22:18.769
If they want to leave,
they're going to leave.

22:19.538 --> 22:22.473
They'll go, and they'll go,

22:22.475 --> 22:24.508
and there won't be anything
you can do about it.

22:28.947 --> 22:30.014
Come with me.

22:43.128 --> 22:44.395
Go.

23:24.436 --> 23:26.236
Caleb, can you help us
find a way out of here?

23:40.685 --> 23:42.486
You have to stay
because mommy said so.

23:43.722 --> 23:45.756
No, we can't stay.
We have to go home.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.591
<i>This is home.</i>
This is home.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.601
Scott? Come here
for a sec.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.441
Look at the date.

24:09.414 --> 24:11.615
Uh, Caleb?
Do you know

24:11.617 --> 24:13.451
what year you were born?

24:21.960 --> 24:24.128
1976.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.031
And when did you die?

24:28.300 --> 24:29.767
Why didn't you leave too?

24:29.769 --> 24:31.302
What is that supposed to mean?

24:31.304 --> 24:34.505
Is that an accusation?
Are you accusing me of something?

24:34.507 --> 24:36.140
How come you're
the only one left?

24:37.342 --> 24:39.910
Did you hide?
Did you fight them?

24:39.912 --> 24:42.246
Fight who? Who are you
talking about?

24:42.248 --> 24:43.647
They're called the ghost riders.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.017
They took everyone from Canaan.

24:48.186 --> 24:49.520
Why did they leave you?

24:49.522 --> 24:50.855
I don't know!

24:50.857 --> 24:52.323
They took everyone.

24:52.325 --> 24:55.826
But they didn't take...
Me!

25:05.504 --> 25:06.770
You're a banshee.

25:09.474 --> 25:11.475
Almost there.
Last chance to bail.

25:11.477 --> 25:12.610
If we're gonna stand a chance,

25:12.612 --> 25:14.111
we have to do something drastic.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.614
There's drastic
and then there's this.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.182
I know, it's not
the perfect plan.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.451
But we need the bad part of
the plan to make the good part work.

25:20.453 --> 25:22.319
You think she knows
it's a bad plan?

25:22.321 --> 25:24.522
Anyone would know
this is a bad plan.

25:28.527 --> 25:32.463
Which is why I have
to ask you one more time,

25:32.465 --> 25:36.233
are you sure you don't wanna
change your minds?

25:36.235 --> 25:37.868
We don't know what else to do.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.971
It's like the ghost
riders are unstoppable.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.673
They are unstoppable.

25:42.675 --> 25:45.142
They've been riding the
storm and taking souls

25:45.144 --> 25:47.811
since long before I was born.

25:47.813 --> 25:51.649
Yeah, we won't survive them.
Not without your help.

25:54.352 --> 25:58.422
Kira entrusted me with her sword
while she's with the skinwalkers.

25:58.424 --> 26:04.562
And now, I'm trusting you because
I believe she would want me to.

26:04.564 --> 26:08.065
Do not mistake this for me
agreeing with your decision.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.035
I understand.

26:11.037 --> 26:16.073
Kira just stabbed her
sword into the ground.

26:16.075 --> 26:19.743
If you want to do this,
you'll have to do it yourself.

26:40.932 --> 26:46.937
Once it's done, whatever happens
will be your responsibility.

27:11.262 --> 27:12.363
Liam, wait!

27:54.873 --> 27:58.108
<i>Mil.</i> Celtic for honey.

27:58.110 --> 28:02.946
It's not an herb, but it is a
binding agent and a natural antibiotic.

28:27.706 --> 28:30.374
Oh, God.
Bite down on this, bite down on this.

28:30.376 --> 28:33.243
It'll help. It's okay.
It's okay.

28:53.665 --> 28:55.399
Am I having another
hallucination?

29:00.505 --> 29:02.940
If you are, I'm having
the same one.

29:04.909 --> 29:07.277
We've got to get out of here.

29:07.279 --> 29:09.079
I know you're not gonna beat
an eight-year-old's ass,

29:09.081 --> 29:10.147
but I will.

29:17.856 --> 29:19.790
You don't look so good.

29:23.561 --> 29:25.095
Maybe you should sit down.

29:26.631 --> 29:28.966
It's not my fault
they didn't take me.

29:28.968 --> 29:30.534
I know why they didn't...

29:30.536 --> 29:33.937
You think I helped them because
they brought back my dead son.

29:36.407 --> 29:37.508
What did you say?

31:25.884 --> 31:28.185
Theo! We're not
trying to hurt you.

31:28.187 --> 31:30.153
We're the ones that
brought you back.

31:31.389 --> 31:32.656
Where's my sister?

31:32.658 --> 31:34.391
Your sister's dead.

31:35.828 --> 31:37.761
She died a long time ago.

31:37.763 --> 31:39.296
You killed her, remember?

31:42.368 --> 31:43.867
I'm gonna kill you, too.

31:43.869 --> 31:45.669
I'm gonna kill all of you.

31:45.671 --> 31:47.271
Okay. Send him back.

31:49.674 --> 31:51.008
You know what this does?

31:57.015 --> 31:59.049
We need your power to help us.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.351
Then you can kill
whoever you want.

32:01.353 --> 32:05.088
But if you do kill us, you're gonna
end up worse off than ever.

32:07.358 --> 32:10.193
There's nothing worse than
what I've been through.

32:10.195 --> 32:11.635
You ever hear about
the ghost riders?

32:22.740 --> 32:24.300
What makes you think
this is gonna work?

32:25.877 --> 32:29.179
You took Josh's power.
You can do it.

32:36.621 --> 32:37.688
Here we go.

32:47.899 --> 32:49.199
Hey, what the hell?

32:51.102 --> 32:52.736
That was only
one billion joules.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.071
Only?

32:54.073 --> 32:55.993
Well, how many joules are
in a bolt of lightning?

32:57.342 --> 32:58.475
Five billion.

33:00.244 --> 33:04.614
Well, I'm fine, by the way.
Thank you for your concern.

33:04.616 --> 33:06.336
You don't have Josh's
power anymore, do you?

33:10.321 --> 33:11.989
Or Tracy's.

33:11.991 --> 33:13.991
Guess I'm back to classic Theo.

33:13.993 --> 33:15.792
Maybe you should
try some remorse,

33:15.794 --> 33:17.427
since you killed them
for their powers.

33:17.429 --> 33:19.596
I just put them back
the way I found them.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.164
Okay.
Send him back.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.101
Hold on. I can help.

33:25.336 --> 33:28.005
I know about the wild hunt
from the dread doctors.

33:28.007 --> 33:29.847
I also know about things
I'm betting you don't.

33:38.182 --> 33:39.683
I'm with Ms. Romero
on this one.

33:41.386 --> 33:42.452
Send him back.

33:43.287 --> 33:45.222
Who's making decisions
around here?

33:45.224 --> 33:47.090
Where's Scott?
Where's stiles?

33:49.127 --> 33:51.128
You remember stiles?

33:51.130 --> 33:52.596
Why wouldn't I remember stiles?

33:55.233 --> 33:57.267
Maybe he's useful after all.

33:58.469 --> 34:00.470
You didn't know what
was happening, did you?

34:00.472 --> 34:02.739
You only saw them
at the very end.

34:02.741 --> 34:04.374
They were all around me

34:05.143 --> 34:06.743
but they didn't take me.

34:08.179 --> 34:09.646
It's because you're a banshee.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.216
Like me.

34:25.029 --> 34:26.295
How long has it been?

34:27.165 --> 34:28.431
Almost 30 years.

34:32.335 --> 34:34.603
Breathe, Malia, you have to breathe.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.241
Lydia!

34:43.181 --> 34:44.947
What are you doing to us?

34:44.949 --> 34:46.416
You're drowning.
Just like me.

34:47.251 --> 34:49.853
Now we can be friends forever.

34:52.056 --> 34:53.322
You won't be taken.

34:55.525 --> 34:56.693
You'll be safe.

34:57.862 --> 34:59.296
I don't want to be safe.

35:00.731 --> 35:02.499
I want to save stiles.

35:09.073 --> 35:11.274
Don't let me be the only one left behind.

35:13.878 --> 35:15.445
I don't have a Caleb.

35:17.815 --> 35:19.116
Go.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.631
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

35:35.633 --> 35:37.400
Mommy says you can go now.

35:51.315 --> 35:52.716
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.417
Yeah, absolutely.

36:01.492 --> 36:03.360
You know you can still
come with us.

36:05.029 --> 36:07.264
I couldn't leave Caleb.

36:07.266 --> 36:09.266
Lenore, you know he's not real.

36:17.108 --> 36:18.675
I couldn't leave Caleb.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.524
<i>You know all about
the ghost riders.</i>

36:34.526 --> 36:37.360
How do we get stiles
and the others back?

36:38.129 --> 36:40.130
You can't.

36:40.132 --> 36:42.866
The wild hunt comes.
The wild hunt goes.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.660
But they're still here. And

36:45.685 --> 36:47.895
they're still taking people.

36:49.907 --> 36:51.208
That's not possible.

36:52.643 --> 36:53.991
They're the wild hunt.
They're not

36:54.016 --> 36:55.402
just gonna stick around.
Unless...

36:56.514 --> 36:58.081
Unless what?

36:58.083 --> 36:59.416
Unless they're stuck.

37:03.421 --> 37:05.889
You guys think stiles
sent us here to warn us?

37:05.891 --> 37:07.386
Maybe beacon hills is gonna

37:07.411 --> 37:08.825
be the next ghost town.

37:08.827 --> 37:11.361
If we don't stop it, yes.

37:11.363 --> 37:12.829
We need to get them
to leave. Now.

37:12.831 --> 37:14.831
We can't. Not yet.

37:18.102 --> 37:19.369
You're gonna help us.

37:19.371 --> 37:20.870
Liam, I don't know what to do.

37:20.872 --> 37:21.938
Well, you remember stiles,

37:21.940 --> 37:24.374
so clearly you know
more than we do.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.643
You're gonna help us
or you're going back.

37:28.679 --> 37:30.072
Let me guess. Scott wasn't a

37:30.097 --> 37:31.538
part of this plan, was he?

37:33.451 --> 37:35.252
Why can't we get rid of them?

37:35.254 --> 37:37.120
Because I saw what happens
to the people they've taken

37:37.122 --> 37:38.788
when they leave.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.257
Do they all die?

37:40.259 --> 37:42.792
No. It's something
worse than death.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.296
I felt it in Lenore's memory.

37:48.032 --> 37:50.900
It's like their souls
hollowed out.

37:50.902 --> 37:52.535
They became something else.

37:52.537 --> 37:54.304
I think they became
ghost riders.

37:55.406 --> 37:57.674
And then, they were gone.

38:14.759 --> 38:16.599
Somehow I don't think
we're gonna hug this out.

38:21.098 --> 38:22.365
Are you okay?

38:23.501 --> 38:24.634
I'm fine.

38:29.173 --> 38:31.775
Okay, I was thinking
about Lenore.

38:31.777 --> 38:32.920
There's myths about the

38:32.945 --> 38:34.411
wild hunt and the Morrigan.

38:34.413 --> 38:36.246
They left Lenore behind.

38:36.248 --> 38:37.514
I thought Lenore was a banshee?

38:38.316 --> 38:39.816
The Morrigan was a banshee.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.531
So when the wild hunt moves

38:42.556 --> 38:44.020
on from beacon hills...

38:44.022 --> 38:45.322
I'll be like Lenore.

38:47.758 --> 38:48.925
Left behind.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.428
Alone.

38:52.763 --> 38:53.515
I hope you realize it's

38:53.540 --> 38:54.431
taking all of my strength

38:54.433 --> 38:55.999
to not tear you
in half right now.

39:01.772 --> 39:03.540
Hey, Malia. You
aren't still upset

39:03.542 --> 39:06.533
about the whole shooting
thing, are you?

39:27.164 --> 39:28.431
What are you doing?

39:30.534 --> 39:32.869
Sorry, didn't mean to wake you.

39:34.405 --> 39:36.887
I was just, uh, I
was just thinking

39:36.912 --> 39:39.576
about how strong and
amazing you are.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.060
Mmm... keep talking, I

39:41.085 --> 39:42.970
like the way that sounds.

39:45.316 --> 39:45.983
You know, someone should

39:46.008 --> 39:46.649
write a medical paper

39:46.651 --> 39:48.818
about how you beat
frontal temporal dementia.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.888
That is not at all the direction

39:51.890 --> 39:54.524
I thought this
conversation was heading.

39:54.526 --> 39:55.592
Sorry.

39:56.994 --> 39:58.661
Hmm, let's turn in.

39:58.663 --> 40:00.239
We gotta be up early
to talk to the

40:00.264 --> 40:02.165
contractor about replacing
that wallpaper.

40:02.167 --> 40:03.666
I'll be there in a minute.

40:03.668 --> 40:04.734
Okay.
