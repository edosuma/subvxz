WEBVTT

00:03.090 --> 00:07.007
Good job on your chores.
Emme, that's for you.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.486
Teddy, that's for you.

00:08.530 --> 00:09.922
Two dollars?

00:09.966 --> 00:11.924
That's less than I pay Emme
to do my chores for me.

00:14.101 --> 00:14.579
Ah!

00:14.623 --> 00:15.537
Not so fast.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.539
You still have one more chore.

00:17.582 --> 00:18.670
Fine.

00:22.979 --> 00:24.676
Okay, paying for a hug

00:24.720 --> 00:27.679
doesn't make it
any less special!

00:27.723 --> 00:28.941
Hey.

00:28.985 --> 00:30.639
So, that Halloween store
downtown

00:30.682 --> 00:31.944
is going out of business.

00:31.988 --> 00:33.381
And you know how
I love a good deal.

00:33.424 --> 00:34.599
Right?Mm.

00:34.643 --> 00:36.166
So I got this for Emme.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.733
Huh?

00:37.776 --> 00:38.864
Princess dress

00:38.908 --> 00:40.475
for my little princess.

00:40.518 --> 00:42.085
Huh?

00:42.129 --> 00:44.087
Look, it's sweet of you
to think of Emme,

00:44.131 --> 00:45.915
but you can't give that to her.

00:45.958 --> 00:47.525
What

00:47.569 --> 00:50.528
Because princess stories
are just a bad influence

00:50.572 --> 00:52.095
on little girls, you know?

00:52.139 --> 00:55.011
It teaches 'em stuff
like you need a man to save you.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.405
Who told you that?

00:58.319 --> 00:59.581
Was it Beyoncé? 'Cause I know

00:59.624 --> 01:01.757
she's got
some mysterious hold on you.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.759
No, no, no.
Think about it, okay?

01:03.802 --> 01:06.370
In Beauty and the Beast,
that girl was just a hostage.

01:06.414 --> 01:08.677
Yeah.
She had Stockholm syndrome.

01:09.939 --> 01:11.375
And-and in Sleeping Beauty,uh,

01:11.419 --> 01:12.637
she marries the first guy
that kisses her

01:12.681 --> 01:15.075
because she got roofied.

01:16.119 --> 01:17.599
What kind of message

01:17.642 --> 01:19.731
do you think that dress sends
to Emme?

01:19.775 --> 01:22.647
"I love you
and I got you a present."

01:22.691 --> 01:25.172
It's just,
I've been working for years

01:25.215 --> 01:27.739
to keep that stuff out
of the house.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.915
I mean, when Kate was little
and she wanted a princess dress,

01:29.959 --> 01:33.484
I told her
she was allergic to glitter.

01:33.528 --> 01:36.183
I didn't know
you were doing that.Yeah, it's how I keep

01:36.226 --> 01:38.010
the kids from doing things
that are bad for them.

01:38.054 --> 01:41.579
I call it
my protective love bubble.

01:41.623 --> 01:44.321
Your what bubble?

01:44.365 --> 01:45.801
My love bubble.

01:45.844 --> 01:48.673
You know, little white lies
that are for their own good.

01:48.717 --> 01:51.763
Oh. Hey, I'm not opposed
to lying to our children.

01:51.807 --> 01:53.896
Great. So we're agreed.

01:53.939 --> 01:55.419
No, no.

01:55.463 --> 01:57.639
I don't think these
dresses are bad.

01:57.682 --> 01:59.641
You kept princesses away
from Katie,

01:59.684 --> 02:02.818
and-- let's be honest--
she's kind of a frowner.

02:02.861 --> 02:04.515
No, she's not.

02:04.559 --> 02:07.127
I happen to know
you pay her for hugs.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.216
Emme's my last one.

02:09.259 --> 02:10.565
I want a smiler.

02:10.608 --> 02:13.133
I want a huggy smiler.

02:13.176 --> 02:15.396
I'm taking that dress back.No, you're not.

02:15.439 --> 02:16.614
Okay.

02:16.658 --> 02:19.835
We've been
in this situation before,

02:19.878 --> 02:22.533
and it usually doesn't end well
for you.

02:22.577 --> 02:26.058
You... you may recall I have
a few tricks up my sleeve.

02:26.102 --> 02:27.756
Uh

02:27.799 --> 02:30.193
It's a protective love bubble.

02:30.237 --> 02:31.716
Well, I'm popping it.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.153
Bubble time is over.

02:33.196 --> 02:36.156
Emme, put down those
gender-neutral toys!

02:36.199 --> 02:38.593
Daddy got you
something sparkly!

02:42.901 --> 02:45.861
A toast to Princess Emme.

02:45.904 --> 02:47.254
Who got you that
pretty dress?

02:47.297 --> 02:48.951
You did.

02:48.994 --> 02:50.953
That's right. Daddy did.

02:50.996 --> 02:53.869
And who loved it so much
she wore it to bed last night?

02:53.912 --> 02:55.827
I did.That's right.

02:55.871 --> 02:59.222
Mommy's face was so funny.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.658
Hey, guys.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.094
ADAM:
There she is.

03:02.138 --> 03:03.661
Don't mind us.

03:03.705 --> 03:06.142
We're just having another
princess tea party.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.753
There's Mommy's
funny face again.

03:08.797 --> 03:11.539
Emme, honey, um,

03:11.582 --> 03:13.758
I hate to pull you away
from all this fun,

03:13.802 --> 03:14.759
but, um,

03:14.803 --> 03:16.370
I got you a new doll.

03:16.413 --> 03:18.676
Yeah. And I think
you are gonna love her

03:18.720 --> 03:19.721
even more
than you love your dress.

03:19.764 --> 03:21.157
Who is it

03:21.201 --> 03:22.506
Snow White?

03:22.550 --> 03:24.508
No. E-Even better.

03:24.552 --> 03:28.164
Supreme Court Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg!

03:29.296 --> 03:30.993
Oh, Andi.

03:32.734 --> 03:35.563
Why does this man have
a girl name?

03:35.606 --> 03:37.782
No, it's a girl.

03:37.826 --> 03:41.917
She just has more important
things to do than fix her hair.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.788
Where are her sparkles?

03:43.832 --> 03:44.963
On her brain.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.356
Yeah.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.923
Ruth here has done

03:47.966 --> 03:50.578
a lot of important
work for our country.

03:50.621 --> 03:51.796
Oh, yeah

03:51.840 --> 03:54.016
What?

03:55.800 --> 03:58.760
Well, you're such an expert
on her accomplishments.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.762
We'd like to hear a few.

04:00.805 --> 04:03.808
Let's see what happens.

04:05.506 --> 04:07.682
One of her accomplishments is
that she doesn't have a husband

04:07.725 --> 04:09.249
that asks too many questions.

04:11.860 --> 04:14.515
Thanks, Mommy.
I love her.

04:14.558 --> 04:17.822
Oh. Really?

04:17.866 --> 04:20.912
She can be the witch who puts
a curse on the princess!

04:20.956 --> 04:23.263
No, no!
She's not a witch!

04:23.306 --> 04:25.265
She's a judge
who's famous for...

04:25.308 --> 04:27.136
She's famous for...

04:27.179 --> 04:29.312
I should've kept the box.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.314
It was all on the box!

04:33.577 --> 04:37.015
And Adam
lived happily ever after.

04:38.321 --> 04:40.758
♪

04:49.289 --> 04:51.552
Check out what happened
to Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

04:51.595 --> 04:53.554
She went upstairs
in her judge's robe,

04:53.597 --> 04:57.601
and she came back down
in a coconut bra.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.172
Aw,

05:03.215 --> 05:04.391
man.

05:04.434 --> 05:06.741
Emme glittered Ginsburg?

05:06.784 --> 05:10.310
I don't mind seeing
Ruth cut loose a little.

05:11.615 --> 05:13.095
This is what happens
when you bring princesses

05:13.138 --> 05:14.575
into our house.

05:14.618 --> 05:16.316
They bully the smart girls.

05:17.621 --> 05:20.842
This dinner took an odd turn.

05:20.885 --> 05:22.322
Hit 'em with the dessert
we brought, Don.Ooh.

05:23.410 --> 05:24.846
Bear claws.

05:24.889 --> 05:27.370
The tastiest of all claws.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.416
Ah, I haven't had one of these

05:29.459 --> 05:31.548
since Zellner's Bakery
closed down.

05:31.592 --> 05:33.507
Oh, no, no, it's not closed;
that's where we got them.

05:33.550 --> 05:35.073
What?

05:35.117 --> 05:36.466
You told me
they went out of business.

05:36.510 --> 05:38.033
No, I didn't.

05:38.076 --> 05:40.601
Mm-mm.

05:41.863 --> 05:43.865
You know, that seems
like something

05:43.908 --> 05:46.607
you might've dreamed. Yeah.

05:46.650 --> 05:49.827
Ah, y-you do dream
about bakeries a lot.

05:49.871 --> 05:52.700
Like you're trapped, and
have to eat your way out?

05:52.743 --> 05:54.484
I had that one.

05:54.528 --> 05:56.268
No, no, I'm pretty sure
this was real.

05:56.312 --> 05:58.053
Why would you say it was closed
if it wasn't?

05:58.096 --> 06:00.882
Eh, I guess I can
tell you now.

06:00.925 --> 06:03.014
It's just, e-every weekend,
you'd make yourself sick

06:03.058 --> 06:04.538
by eating too many bear claws.

06:04.581 --> 06:06.366
You'd swear not to do it again,

06:06.409 --> 06:09.978
but then, the next weekend,
you'd be right back on the claw.

06:10.021 --> 06:12.720
But they made me happy
when they were in my mouth.

06:12.763 --> 06:14.461
Well...

06:14.504 --> 06:17.812
it was just a little white
lie, for your own good.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.117
ADAM: But that's
what you do

06:19.161 --> 06:20.380
to the kids.
I...

06:23.731 --> 06:26.821
You put me in your lie balloon.

06:26.864 --> 06:29.606
It's a love bubble.

06:29.650 --> 06:32.566
And who wouldn't want to
be surrounded by love?

06:32.609 --> 06:34.350
Okay, just because you put
the word "love"

06:34.394 --> 06:36.613
in front of something
doesn't make it good.

06:36.657 --> 06:38.572
"Love murder" is still murder.

06:40.617 --> 06:43.403
Well, at least "love
bubble" is a fun name.

06:43.446 --> 06:45.753
Marcy does the same thing
to me, but she just calls it

06:45.796 --> 06:47.102
"take it or leave it."

06:48.538 --> 06:50.453
I had it engraved on the inside
of his wedding band.

06:50.497 --> 06:51.498
Mm-hmm.

06:51.541 --> 06:53.848
Right. I make my own decisions

06:53.891 --> 06:56.459
about what's good for me--
even if it's bad for me.

06:56.503 --> 06:58.983
I'm an American man,
that's what we do.

06:59.027 --> 07:01.464
Adam, relax.

07:01.508 --> 07:02.596
You guys
are diamonds,

07:02.639 --> 07:03.684
and we love you.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.120
But what makes a diamond?

07:05.163 --> 07:08.819
A chunk of coal
under constant pressure.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.299
DON:
I did just fine

07:10.342 --> 07:11.822
for 30 years
without your help.

07:11.866 --> 07:13.345
I did.Oh, please. Without me,
you'd still be

07:13.389 --> 07:15.478
living in that sad apartment
where I found you.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.525
Hey, that was my
groovy bachelor pad.
Ugh.

07:18.568 --> 07:21.179
I put up some respectable
numbers in there.

07:21.223 --> 07:22.920
When I first met Adam,

07:22.964 --> 07:25.662
everything he wore had the
name of a sports team on it.

07:25.706 --> 07:27.316
His whole wardrobe
looked like it got shot

07:27.359 --> 07:29.144
out of a T-shirt cannon.

07:30.014 --> 07:31.494
That's not true.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.714
My-- I had that one,
it looked like a tuxedo.

07:33.757 --> 07:34.758
Remember?

07:34.802 --> 07:36.499
I wore it to your
cousin's wedding.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.501
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Remember?

07:38.545 --> 07:40.503
It took me six Christmases

07:40.547 --> 07:43.158
to gently replace every
shirt in Adam's drawer.

07:43.201 --> 07:45.377
Oh, I remember. Every time we'd
come to dinner, I'd smuggle out

07:45.421 --> 07:47.162
some of your old T-shirts
in my coat.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.078
Was that what it was?

07:50.121 --> 07:51.558
I just thought after you ate,
your stomach got real big,

07:51.601 --> 07:53.168
like a snake.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.741
I love you.

08:00.784 --> 08:04.005
You told me the washing
machine ripped them.

08:04.048 --> 08:07.225
Mm, washing machine, garbage
truck, me and my scissors,

08:07.269 --> 08:08.836
something ripped them.

08:09.793 --> 08:10.881
So, first the bear claws,

08:10.925 --> 08:12.535
now the T-shirts; that's two.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.319
Is there anything else?

08:14.363 --> 08:15.582
No.

08:15.625 --> 08:18.019
That's a yes.

08:18.062 --> 08:20.412
What is it

08:20.456 --> 08:21.588
Hey.

08:21.631 --> 08:26.114
Who wants a bear claw?

08:26.157 --> 08:28.072
Me, for the last seven years.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.685
ADAM:
I know

08:31.728 --> 08:33.077
there's something big
Andi's keeping from me,

08:33.121 --> 08:35.645
'cause she's clammed
up, like a... a...

08:35.689 --> 08:37.908
Clam?
Yes.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.475
You've got to put
a stop to this.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.781
I didn't, and look at me.

08:40.824 --> 08:42.478
I haven't had a sweater
with sleeves on it

08:42.522 --> 08:43.610
since my wedding day.

08:43.653 --> 08:45.699
Where did my sleeves go?

08:45.742 --> 08:48.310
I don't know,
my wife won't tell me.

08:48.353 --> 08:51.139
Look, I am gonna figure out
what she's been hiding, because

08:51.182 --> 08:55.143
there is no love bubble big
enough to contain Adam Burns.

08:55.186 --> 08:56.318
You're doing
God's work, brother.

08:56.361 --> 08:57.841
Ha.
LOWELL:
Okay, so think.

08:57.885 --> 08:59.669
What are some big things
that you've wanted

08:59.713 --> 09:01.366
that Andi has said no to?

09:01.410 --> 09:04.326
Well, uh, I've always wanted
a grill for the patio,

09:04.369 --> 09:06.154
but Andi said it wouldn't fit.

09:06.197 --> 09:07.329
I bet that's it.

09:07.372 --> 09:09.157
Women are anti-grill.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.812
They don't like anything we can
do while we're drinking beer.

09:11.855 --> 09:15.206
No, no, I measured the patio;
she's right.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.208
Oh, she's good. She's peppering
the lies with truth

09:17.252 --> 09:19.689
to create maximum confusion.

09:19.733 --> 09:21.865
Okay, so what else?

09:21.909 --> 09:23.606
Well, who knows
what she's hiding?

09:23.650 --> 09:24.912
We've been married 17 years.

09:24.955 --> 09:27.218
We both hide lots of stuff.

09:27.262 --> 09:31.832
I got a hollowed out book
just for M&M's.

09:31.875 --> 09:34.617
Stay focused.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.271
You're doing work
for all men, here.

09:36.314 --> 09:37.664
You need to crawl up
out of the swamp,

09:37.707 --> 09:39.491
and tell us what
fresh air smells like.

09:39.535 --> 09:42.756
Okay, uh, well, she knows
I've always wanted a recliner,

09:42.799 --> 09:44.801
but obviously,
I can't have one of those,

09:44.845 --> 09:46.803
because over half
of childhood broken bones

09:46.847 --> 09:49.501
come from recliners. Ha.

09:51.852 --> 09:55.856
Maybe I should
remeasure the patio.

09:55.899 --> 09:58.815
Back up. What was that thing
about recliners?

09:58.859 --> 10:00.600
Yeah, that's what
Andi told me.

10:00.643 --> 10:01.862
She saw it on the news.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.603
It's true, over half of all...

10:03.646 --> 10:04.647
Uh-uh.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.649
What? No, no, really. Seriously.

10:06.693 --> 10:07.955
If you-- when you pull
the lever,

10:07.998 --> 10:09.086
your arm could get caught...

10:09.130 --> 10:10.305
Nope.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.830
But don't those things shoot
kids right across the...

10:13.874 --> 10:16.267
It's not a rocket, it's a chair.

10:17.225 --> 10:18.835
I can't believe this.

10:18.879 --> 10:20.663
Why would she
lie about a chair?

10:20.707 --> 10:22.883
Why wouldn't she
lie about a chair?

10:22.926 --> 10:25.973
That's what you need
to be asking yourself.

10:26.016 --> 10:29.629
Oh. So it's the recliner?

10:29.672 --> 10:33.720
She has been keeping me
needlessly upright for years.

10:33.763 --> 10:35.330
Men came down
from the trees.

10:35.373 --> 10:37.201
We started walking and then
we started reclining.

10:37.245 --> 10:39.551
Andi's messing
with evolution.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.119
What are you gonna do?

10:42.163 --> 10:44.687
I don't know, but I need
one of those chairs,

10:44.731 --> 10:47.516
because if I'm like this,
I'm uncomfortable.

10:47.559 --> 10:50.301
If I'm like this, I'm asleep.

10:50.345 --> 10:52.521
This is where I need to be.

10:52.564 --> 10:54.654
This is the sweet spot.

11:02.574 --> 11:04.620
Hello, darling.

11:12.846 --> 11:16.153
Uh-oh.

11:16.197 --> 11:18.242
Yup.

11:18.286 --> 11:21.768
I'm in the sweet spot.

11:21.811 --> 11:24.161
Ah...

11:24.205 --> 11:27.034
I didn't think
you'd figure it out.

11:27.077 --> 11:31.603
You give me 17 years,
I can figure anything out.

11:36.652 --> 11:43.703
So, recliners cause over half
of childhood broken bones, huh?

11:43.746 --> 11:46.227
Okay, I may have rounded it up.

11:46.270 --> 11:49.447
Or made it up.

11:49.491 --> 11:52.537
The point is it was up and when
things are up, they're good.

11:52.581 --> 11:55.540
That's the rule of up.

11:57.804 --> 11:58.805
Look, okay.

11:58.848 --> 12:01.329
Let me give you
a real statistic.

12:01.372 --> 12:06.029
This is where I'm gonna be
spending over half of my time,

12:06.073 --> 12:09.293
eating over half of my meals

12:09.337 --> 12:13.515
and believing less than half
of what you say.

12:13.558 --> 12:15.865
Let's not make a big deal
out of this.

12:15.909 --> 12:16.823
Oh, I'm gonna.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.395
I've never been on the
not-lying side of a lie before.

12:24.439 --> 12:25.832
I am gonna enjoy this.

12:25.875 --> 12:28.791
I guess you deserve that.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.271
Oh, I do. Yeah.

12:30.314 --> 12:32.012
Because you know
what I was thinking,

12:32.055 --> 12:35.276
sitting in the warm embrace of
my Pittsburgh spirit chair?

12:35.319 --> 12:37.321
And, yes, that's
what we're calling it.

12:38.975 --> 12:40.716
Why would you lie
about a recliner?

12:40.760 --> 12:44.546
How is that part of the
protective love bubble?

12:44.589 --> 12:48.942
Well, I was protecting you

12:48.985 --> 12:50.900
from bringing that ugly chair
into my living room.

12:50.944 --> 12:54.991
Ah. So this was
for you, not me.

12:55.035 --> 12:56.558
Yes. You caught me.

12:56.601 --> 12:57.733
Ah-ha! I caught you.

12:59.561 --> 13:01.345
Yeah, I just said that.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.304
I know. I had it
in the chamber.

13:03.347 --> 13:04.914
I was gonna say it
no matter what.

13:04.958 --> 13:10.006
Honey, the love bubble
started out innocently.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.400
Right? I-I'd tell the kids
not to do something

13:12.443 --> 13:15.011
and then they keep asking,
"Why Why?"

13:15.055 --> 13:17.797
It was just easier
to tell a little fib.

13:17.840 --> 13:18.841
Mm-hmm.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.408
But-but then I
used it on you

13:20.451 --> 13:23.846
and-and-and my love bubble
became a...

13:23.890 --> 13:24.978
Lie balloon.

13:26.631 --> 13:29.852
Just like I said.
Ah-ha again.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.942
And you were right
and I'm really sorry.

13:32.986 --> 13:35.031
What?

13:35.075 --> 13:38.643
You were right
and I'm sorry.

13:43.431 --> 13:44.954
Okay, I don't
know what to say

13:44.998 --> 13:46.390
because I never thought
this would happen.

13:48.915 --> 13:51.047
Well, it's happening.

13:51.091 --> 13:54.050
I don't buy it.
You're up to something.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.486
What, do you think
I'm lying?

13:55.530 --> 13:57.401
After a multiyear
recliner conspiracy,

13:57.445 --> 13:59.099
I tend to be a
little skeptical.

14:03.451 --> 14:04.974
I got my eye on you.

14:09.065 --> 14:12.982
Ah, damn. I should've sprung
for the swiveler.

14:15.376 --> 14:17.073
Andi said she was sorry?
Yup.

14:17.117 --> 14:18.901
Like she's sorry
she married you?

14:18.945 --> 14:24.472
No, no, but something's...
something's definitely fishy.

14:24.515 --> 14:26.387
She said I was right.

14:27.779 --> 14:29.781
That's not the woman
I married.

14:29.825 --> 14:32.697
I bet she's buying
time to regroup.

14:32.741 --> 14:34.961
Has she done anything
else suspicious?

14:35.004 --> 14:39.574
Yeah. Yeah, she said she felt
so bad that her and Marcy

14:39.617 --> 14:41.924
went all the way
across town to Tony's

14:41.968 --> 14:43.578
to get my favorite pizza
for dinner.

14:43.621 --> 14:44.971
That's a diversion.

14:45.014 --> 14:47.930
There's definitely gonna
be a counterattack.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.584
Although I do hope
she got breadsticks.

14:49.627 --> 14:51.978
It's gonna take more
than great pizza to fool me.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.980
That's right.

14:54.023 --> 14:55.720
But all bets are off if
she got the breadsticks.

14:55.764 --> 14:57.940
Okay.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.116
Uh-huh.

15:00.160 --> 15:04.033
O-Okay. Uh, can you hold on
just for one second?

15:04.077 --> 15:06.427
The principal from Emme's school
is on the phone.

15:06.470 --> 15:08.646
Emme's been kissing boys.

15:08.690 --> 15:11.867
What? I don't want my baby
doing that.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.477
Yeah, well, apparently,
she's been looking

15:13.521 --> 15:15.915
for her Prince Charming, thanks
to your little princess kick.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.919
You're good.

15:20.963 --> 15:23.661
I see what's happening here.

15:23.705 --> 15:25.968
I thought you'd come after
the recliner,

15:26.012 --> 15:29.667
but you're doing an end run
all the way back to princesses.

15:31.582 --> 15:32.975
What?

15:33.019 --> 15:34.977
Got to admire the technique.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.979
Yeah. So what's your game, huh?

15:37.023 --> 15:38.763
I'm supposed to feel so bad
about Emme

15:38.807 --> 15:41.027
that I give up my recliner

15:41.070 --> 15:42.115
Is that it

15:42.158 --> 15:45.118
Adam, I have a job
and three children.

15:45.161 --> 15:48.469
I don't have time to be
a criminal mastermind. Okay?

15:48.512 --> 15:51.341
I'm-I'm telling you that Emme's
principal is on the phone.

15:51.385 --> 15:54.214
Oh, sure.
The old fake phone call.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.999
Yeah, well, the kid is one step
ahead of you this time, huh?

15:57.043 --> 15:58.479
What do you think, Don?

15:58.522 --> 16:01.961
It's the sauce.
That's the secret.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.878
It's Marcy on the phone,
isn't it?

16:06.922 --> 16:08.054
Huh

16:08.097 --> 16:10.012
Upstairs

16:10.056 --> 16:11.840
Okay.

16:11.883 --> 16:13.755
Yeah. This is Adam Burns.

16:13.798 --> 16:15.017
Let me tell you something.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.671
My daughter can kiss
whoever she wants.

16:16.714 --> 16:19.195
In fact, maybe I'll
come down there

16:19.239 --> 16:22.851
and give you a big kiss, too,
Principal Marcy.

16:22.894 --> 16:24.244
Who's he talking to?

16:29.075 --> 16:30.119
:
It's for you.

16:30.163 --> 16:32.861
Nope. Mm-mm.

16:35.081 --> 16:37.648
Hi.

16:38.910 --> 16:41.217
Uh-huh.

16:41.261 --> 16:42.653
We'll be there first thing
in the morning.

16:45.091 --> 16:48.050
Yes, ma'am, I do need to work
on my attitude.

16:52.098 --> 16:55.188
You want to tell me
what just happened here?

16:55.231 --> 16:59.061
:
It's funny because I thought

16:59.105 --> 17:01.063
you were doing something,

17:01.107 --> 17:03.326
but you were actually
just being honest.

17:04.545 --> 17:07.287
I hide M&M's in a book.

17:09.854 --> 17:12.118
I guess we got ourselves worked
up for nothing out there, huh?

17:14.163 --> 17:16.209
Ah, what are you
gonna do, right?

17:20.430 --> 17:21.997
Although, after your
behavior on the phone,

17:22.041 --> 17:23.694
I shouldn't be too surprised
about your daughter.

17:23.738 --> 17:25.131
And I'll tell you
something else.

17:25.174 --> 17:27.002
Kissing boys
is a perfect example

17:27.046 --> 17:30.179
of why we discourage these
ridiculous princess obsessions.

17:32.616 --> 17:34.096
Stop looking at me.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.620
You're making my ear hot.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.189
All right, listen.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.104
We need to go in together
and talk to Emme

17:42.148 --> 17:43.932
about this boy-kissing
business. Okay?

17:43.975 --> 17:45.847
Now, I know we both
made some mistakes.

17:45.890 --> 17:49.242
Well, I made a mistake and then
you made a much bigger mistake.

17:49.285 --> 17:52.549
The important thing is

17:52.593 --> 17:55.422
that when we talk to Emme
we do it bubble-free. No lies.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.554
Agreed. But it's
a shame, you know?

17:57.598 --> 17:59.991
I mean, the bubble
and I had a good run.

18:00.035 --> 18:02.168
Oh. Um...

18:02.211 --> 18:05.475
well, I should tell you
that guys in tank tops

18:05.519 --> 18:07.521
don't really get
more speeding tickets.

18:07.564 --> 18:09.262
I knew it.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.439
Summer can't come fast enough.

18:12.482 --> 18:15.181
Hey, sweetie.

18:15.224 --> 18:19.620
Hey, Emme. Uh...

18:19.663 --> 18:22.884
we talked to your principal
today and...

18:22.927 --> 18:25.626
it's not okay
to kiss boys.

18:25.669 --> 18:28.150
But I was just looking
for my prince.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.325
I know, honey.

18:29.369 --> 18:30.239
But those princess stories,

18:30.283 --> 18:31.762
they're-they're just made-up.

18:31.806 --> 18:34.548
You can't act like that
in real life.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.767
Why?

18:38.204 --> 18:41.076
Because little girls
are strong, too,

18:41.120 --> 18:43.296
and it's better if
they stand on their own.

18:43.339 --> 18:46.037
Why?

18:47.343 --> 18:50.433
Because it's a big world
out there, okay?

18:50.477 --> 18:53.480
And the only thing that
you can really depend on

18:53.523 --> 18:56.700
is your own self-respect.

18:56.744 --> 18:58.920
Why?

19:01.270 --> 19:02.706
Because Snow White called

19:02.750 --> 19:04.317
and said you were being
too cute in your dress

19:04.360 --> 19:06.362
and made her look bad.

19:06.406 --> 19:08.190
That makes sense.
Mm.

19:11.846 --> 19:13.369
Welcome back to the bubble.

19:20.811 --> 19:22.030
How about this?

19:22.073 --> 19:23.292
You get rid of the chair

19:23.336 --> 19:26.513
and I'll talk to Teddy
about using deodorant.

19:26.556 --> 19:27.818
Doesn't bother me.

19:27.862 --> 19:30.647
His smell is just my
smell on a little kid.

19:30.691 --> 19:32.606
Okay, how about this?

19:32.649 --> 19:37.915
You and I can have sex,
lots of sex.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.874
Already having it. You
like it as much as me.

19:39.917 --> 19:40.788
Try again.

19:40.831 --> 19:43.007
I got it.

19:43.051 --> 19:46.010
You get rid of the chair, I'll
move the furniture off the patio

19:46.054 --> 19:48.752
and you can put in
a big built-in grill.

19:48.796 --> 19:49.971
Huh?

19:54.628 --> 19:55.629
Deal.
Ah.

19:56.934 --> 19:59.241
So, uh, what are you gonna
do with the chair?

19:59.285 --> 20:00.851
Well, I'll just

20:00.895 --> 20:03.245
put it out on the curb and
hope it finds a good home.

20:03.289 --> 20:06.030
What kind of nitwit
would take that?

20:07.902 --> 20:12.211
There's the sweet spot.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.040
No.

20:16.084 --> 20:19.043
Okay, I'll give up the recliner
if you agree...

20:19.087 --> 20:21.045
Honey, it's me or the chair.

20:21.089 --> 20:23.004
I'm gonna miss you, baby.

20:23.047 --> 20:24.092
Don.

20:24.135 --> 20:25.659
I was talking to the chair.

20:25.702 --> 20:27.051
Ugh.

20:27.095 --> 20:30.054
I wasn't talking to you.
