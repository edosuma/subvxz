<i>Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker,
with Channel Five News.</i>

00:08.183 --> 00:10.779
We now go live to Ollie Williams
recapping the events

00:10.887 --> 00:12.752
<i>of the last episode of Family Guy.</i>

00:12.856 --> 00:14.847
- What happened last time, Ollie?
- Stewie killed Lois!

00:14.958 --> 00:16.084
- Then what?
- Peter got blamed!

00:16.193 --> 00:17.217
- Then what?
- Peter went to court!

00:17.328 --> 00:18.352
- Then what?
- Lois came back!

00:18.462 --> 00:19.520
- How?
- Wasn't really dead!

00:19.630 --> 00:21.359
Thanks, Ollie. And now Part Two.

00:22.233 --> 00:25.601
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:25.704 --> 00:28.935
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:29.041 --> 00:32.603
<i>But where are those
good old-fashioned values</i>

00:32.712 --> 00:35.681
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:35.782 --> 00:38.876
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:38.985 --> 00:42.319
<i>Lucky there's a man who
positively can do</i>

00:42.423 --> 00:43.890
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:43.991 --> 00:45.618
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:45.726 --> 00:50.494
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:55.003 --> 00:57.438
Oh, Lois, sweetheart,
I'm so glad you're alive!

00:57.540 --> 00:59.371
You gotta tell me everything
that happened.

00:59.475 --> 01:01.136
I mean, not tonight,
'cause I got plans with the guys,

01:01.244 --> 01:02.802
but tomorrow night
I wanna hear all about it.

01:02.945 --> 01:06.575
Peter, didn't you hear what I said?
Stewie tried to kill me!

01:06.683 --> 01:10.915
- Mom, Stewie's just a baby.
- No, he's not, Meg! He's evil.

01:11.022 --> 01:13.582
He shot me point-blank
right on the deck of the cruise ship.

<i>I would have been dead
if it hadn't been for a passing merman</i>

01:38.119 --> 01:41.247
<i>who treated my wounds
and carried me to safety.</i>

01:41.857 --> 01:43.449
<i>It sounds romantic, I know,</i>

01:43.558 --> 01:47.961
<i>but unfortunately he was kind of a reverse
of what you'd expect a merman to be.</i>

01:48.063 --> 01:53.559
- I wish to make love to you.
- Oh, no, thank you.

01:53.670 --> 01:55.865
What are you talking about?
I thought this was a woman's fantasy.

01:55.972 --> 01:58.168
Yeah, but this is sort of the opposite.

01:58.275 --> 02:02.336
Like, if you had a man's body and fish legs,
then it'd be different.

02:02.446 --> 02:04.346
- Yeah, but then I wouldn't have a penis.
- Well, but...

02:04.448 --> 02:07.009
See, there you go.
I just poked a huge hole in your logic.

02:07.118 --> 02:10.019
I'm sorry, I'm...
I'm just gonna have to say no.

02:10.121 --> 02:11.884
Maybe I feel like you owe me a little.

02:11.990 --> 02:13.458
Ah! Damn it!

02:15.361 --> 02:18.421
<i>Unfortunately, I was suffering
from total amnesia</i>

02:18.531 --> 02:20.659
<i>and had no idea who I was.</i>

02:20.767 --> 02:23.930
<i>After wandering around for a while,
I discovered I was in North Carolina,</i>

02:25.472 --> 02:28.601
<i>where I managed to get a job
at a summer camp for fat kids.</i>

02:30.578 --> 02:33.513
<i>It was my job to keep the children
from eating each other.</i>

02:33.781 --> 02:39.186
Hey! Hey! No. No, no, no.
Spit him out! Jeffrey! Spit him out now!

02:39.288 --> 02:41.449
And Mike, you spit out Timmy!

02:42.858 --> 02:45.851
<i>Over the next several months,
I developed a relationship</i>

02:45.962 --> 02:49.022
<i>with a seemingly nice, young townie,
named Derek.</i>

02:51.302 --> 02:55.932
<i>Eventually, he got comfortable enough
with me to introduce me to his friends.</i>

02:58.242 --> 03:01.644
<i>That's how I found out
he was a white supremacist.</i>

03:01.747 --> 03:05.342
Okay, first order of business,
I'd like to thank Paul and Tracy,

03:05.450 --> 03:08.443
who have agreed to bring cookies
for next week's punch social.

03:08.554 --> 03:11.921
Just remember, you two,
Fred is allergic to peanuts.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.994
Peanuts and Jews.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.354
No, but Jews are bad.

03:17.464 --> 03:20.399
You know, it's remarks like that
that started the Holocaust,

03:20.501 --> 03:22.868
and I know none of us want that
to happen again.

03:24.072 --> 03:28.304
<i>And after that blow to the head,
it all started coming back to me.</i>

03:29.245 --> 03:32.112
So I rushed back to Quahog,
and here I am.

03:32.214 --> 03:35.945
So what you're saying is we've got
a homicidal baby on our hands.

03:36.052 --> 03:38.248
Mom! Dad! Stewie's gone!

03:41.460 --> 03:44.589
Don't worry, Lois, we'll catch him.
Hobey, radio for backup.

03:44.798 --> 03:46.265
Uh...

03:46.366 --> 03:48.800
<i>- Hello?
This is dispatch, go ahead.</i>

03:48.902 --> 03:50.096
Uh...

03:50.237 --> 03:54.641
We need more cars

03:54.742 --> 03:59.304
'cause we're trying to find...

03:59.413 --> 04:01.279
All right, we'll do it on the way!
We'll do it on the way!

04:04.553 --> 04:07.386
Sorry to bother you,
but we have a fugitive baby on our hands.

04:07.489 --> 04:08.889
Have you seen this child?

04:08.992 --> 04:12.428
No, I haven't, Officer,
but I sure will keep my eyes open.

04:12.529 --> 04:13.518
What is it?

04:13.630 --> 04:16.565
That killer baby
from the trial's gone missing.

04:16.666 --> 04:19.500
- Oh, no!
- I know!

04:22.439 --> 04:23.429
Uh-oh.

04:23.542 --> 04:27.808
The police.
Looks like I got some explaining to do.

04:27.913 --> 04:30.610
No, but how could I help you, Officer?

04:30.716 --> 04:33.014
We're looking for this baby.
Have you seen him?

04:33.119 --> 04:37.453
I'm looking for Kareem under the hoop.
Have you seen him?

04:37.557 --> 04:39.617
No, but I'll let you know if I see anything.

04:45.794 --> 04:49.287
- Mr. Superman no here.
- Well, we're looking for a missing...

04:49.399 --> 04:53.426
No, Mr. Superman, he no is here.

04:53.537 --> 04:56.939
Yeah, okay.
Well, can you just give him this flier?

04:57.041 --> 05:00.977
I... No. No, I have no money.

05:01.078 --> 05:02.842
Just take this flier,
and if you see this baby...

05:02.948 --> 05:04.643
No, no.

05:08.353 --> 05:10.652
Boy, I sure hope they find him.
Otherwise, we're all gonna be...

05:13.059 --> 05:15.721
So it's all out in the open now, isn't it?

05:15.828 --> 05:19.629
Stewie, how long
you been all messed up and evil like this?

05:19.934 --> 05:21.925
So now you're interested in Stewie?

05:22.036 --> 05:24.403
Last week, when I made
that macaroni picture of an owl,

05:24.506 --> 05:25.564
you didn't give a damn!

05:25.674 --> 05:26.834
- That was an owl?
- Yes.

05:26.942 --> 05:29.137
And now we're going to look at it again.

05:31.446 --> 05:33.847
- Look, look! Do you like it?
- Yes!

05:33.950 --> 05:36.544
- What do you like about it, specifically?
- I don't know.

05:36.652 --> 05:38.415
Pick something,
or I'll blow your brains out!

05:38.521 --> 05:42.549
- I like how it looks like an owl.
- Thank you for the compliment!

05:49.167 --> 05:52.136
Hey, everything okay in there?
I heard shouting.

05:53.338 --> 05:56.604
Dog, answer it.
Tell him, "Yes, everything's fine."

05:56.709 --> 05:58.506
Yes, Joe, everything's fine.

05:59.011 --> 06:01.104
- Okay, good.
- Make fun of his wheelchair.

06:01.213 --> 06:02.180
- What?
- What?

06:02.281 --> 06:04.807
Do it.
Say, "Ha-ha-ha, you're in a wheelchair."

06:04.918 --> 06:07.284
Ha-ha-ha, you're in a wheelchair.

06:07.387 --> 06:08.684
What's that supposed to mean?

06:08.788 --> 06:12.623
- Say, "I bet you can't get a boner."
- I bet you can't get a boner.

06:12.727 --> 06:14.092
That's not very nice, Brian.

06:14.195 --> 06:16.959
- "Neither is your mother's ass."
- Neither is your mother's ass.

06:17.064 --> 06:19.397
Well, I'll give you that one.

06:19.501 --> 06:21.469
Now tell him
you've always thought he was handsome.

06:21.570 --> 06:23.470
I've always thought you were handsome.

06:23.572 --> 06:26.940
Well, I got to tell you, Brian,
I'm relieved to hear you say that.

06:27.043 --> 06:29.204
Please call me
if you see any sign of Stewie.

06:29.312 --> 06:31.906
Tell him, " Ha-ha-ha, just kidding
about the handsome thing."

06:32.015 --> 06:33.004
- Come on.
- Do it!

06:33.116 --> 06:34.243
Come on, that meant a lot to him.

06:35.419 --> 06:38.149
Ha-ha-ha, just kidding
about the handsome thing.

06:38.255 --> 06:42.158
Well, that's disappointing.
I needed that boost today.

06:42.260 --> 06:43.989
All right, I'll see you later.

06:46.297 --> 06:49.563
All right, Lois, I'm hungry.
Take those breasts out.

06:50.670 --> 06:52.763
Wait a minute. You could've drugged this.

06:52.872 --> 06:55.170
- Well, I'm no fool. Brian, taste this.
- What?

06:55.274 --> 06:58.836
- Go on, taste it! You're the guinea pig.
- Lois, he's got a gun.

06:58.945 --> 07:03.279
- Look, I'll do it myself. How about that?
- I don't know, he kind of asked me.

07:03.383 --> 07:04.908
I mean, I think we should do what he says.

07:05.053 --> 07:06.418
Well, yeah, but, Brian...

07:06.521 --> 07:08.352
I'm totally willing
to do this for the family.

07:08.456 --> 07:10.890
- I'm not sure...
- I'll do it.

07:10.992 --> 07:13.484
Hey, Griffins, just checking in.

07:13.595 --> 07:15.495
- Oh, my God!
- Holy crap!

07:18.434 --> 07:20.801
Stewie, you killed him! He's dead!

07:20.904 --> 07:23.668
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, what are we gonna do?

07:23.773 --> 07:27.733
- Oh, poor Cleveland.
- It's all right, Lois, he's in Heaven now.

07:28.012 --> 07:31.675
I don't understand why I need to give you
a credit card imprint.

07:31.782 --> 07:33.306
It's kind of a new policy.

07:33.417 --> 07:35.386
I didn't see you ask the guy in front of me.

07:35.487 --> 07:38.923
It's kind of brand new.
Do you have a credit card?

07:39.024 --> 07:42.984
- I got a Sears card.
- They're doing pretty well, huh?

07:43.096 --> 07:46.429
One by my house
got a McDonald's right in the store.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.958
It won't be long before the police notice
Cleveland's disappearance.

07:50.069 --> 07:53.005
Black man gone missing, my God,
the media will be all over that!

07:53.107 --> 07:56.770
All right, if I see any cops following me,
the dog gets it!

08:00.115 --> 08:02.675
Get in. Come on, drive, drive, drive!

08:05.688 --> 08:08.088
There's Joe. Say, "Joe, I think you're cool."

08:08.190 --> 08:11.455
- Joe, I think you're cool.
- Well, thank you, Brian.

08:11.560 --> 08:14.121
That's gonna get me through the rest
of this yard work.

08:14.231 --> 08:16.756
- "No, just kidding, you suck."
- No, just kidding, you suck.

08:16.867 --> 08:18.494
- "Queer."
- Queer.

08:20.170 --> 08:21.866
Well, there goes my smile.

08:26.944 --> 08:28.172
You know,
you're not gonna get away with this.

08:28.279 --> 08:30.805
Kidnapping me is one thing,
but you killed Cleveland!

08:30.916 --> 08:33.043
You forget,
I'm the one holding the gun, Brian.

08:33.184 --> 08:35.346
And you're gonna do exactly as I say.

08:35.453 --> 08:37.183
You mind if I ask where we're going?

08:37.323 --> 08:41.419
You'll know soon enough, Brian.
The world will know soon enough.

08:41.528 --> 08:44.362
<i>I'll be as big as I should have been
when I was on American Idol.</i>

08:44.765 --> 08:50.294
<i>I don't mind not knowing
What I'm headed for</i>

08:50.404 --> 08:53.932
<i>You can take me to the skies</i>

08:55.343 --> 09:00.646
<i>It's like being lost in heaven</i>

09:00.750 --> 09:05.813
<i>When I'm lost in your eyes</i>

09:06.656 --> 09:09.785
Stewie, what the hell was that?

09:09.893 --> 09:12.191
<i>That was Lost In Your Eyes
by Debbie Gibson.</i>

09:12.296 --> 09:14.527
- One of the worst I've ever heard.
- Okay.

09:14.632 --> 09:19.626
Stewie, you shouldn't actually
even be alive, you sniveling little creep.

09:19.737 --> 09:23.765
I hate you so much,
I want to shoot you in your face.

09:23.876 --> 09:25.571
- All right.
- Honey, I like you,

09:25.678 --> 09:28.647
but you're just not right
for this competition.

09:28.747 --> 09:33.276
Yo, dawg, I gotta tell you, for me, man,
that was not even half good, dude.

09:33.386 --> 09:35.445
You can't sing.
What are you doing, Stewie?

09:35.922 --> 09:38.653
I don't even care.
They don't know what they's talking about.

09:38.759 --> 09:40.090
Next time they hear about me,

09:40.194 --> 09:43.027
they's gonna be, like,
"We was wrong about Stewie."

09:43.130 --> 09:44.825
'Cause I's gonna be huge.

09:44.932 --> 09:48.061
I's gonna be bigger
than every one of all y'alls.

09:51.696 --> 09:53.392
Hey. Hey, you know
what we should do, guys,

09:53.499 --> 09:55.490
- while we're here tied up like this?
- What?

09:55.601 --> 09:58.661
We should come up with
a totally bogus rumor about a celebrity.

09:58.771 --> 10:01.502
And then when we get out of here,
we'll spread it around as much as we can.

10:01.608 --> 10:04.839
- That sounds like fun!
- Actually, that does sound like fun.

10:04.945 --> 10:08.176
- What'd you have in mind?
- Okay, okay, how about this?

10:08.283 --> 10:10.615
Hey, did you guys hear
about Rob Schneider?

10:10.718 --> 10:13.209
Somebody told me
he goes down to Home Depot

10:13.321 --> 10:16.052
and pays the migrant workers
to go to his house

10:16.158 --> 10:18.558
and choke him
while he masturbates in the shower.

10:18.661 --> 10:20.925
I could buy that.
That sounds like something he'd do.

10:21.030 --> 10:24.023
Well, I think that's awful
that Rob Schneider does that.

10:24.134 --> 10:26.295
Yeah, isn't that a disgusting,
absolute fact?

10:26.436 --> 10:28.870
Yeah! We're starting a rumor!

10:28.972 --> 10:31.737
- Wait a minute. Chris, are you clapping?
- Yeah!

10:31.876 --> 10:33.741
- So your hands are free.
- Yeah!

10:33.844 --> 10:36.938
- Stewie didn't tie up your hands.
- No, he must have forgot.

10:37.048 --> 10:40.143
You've realized,
we've been sitting here for 14 hours.

10:40.252 --> 10:41.981
Well, get pissy if you want, Mom.

10:42.087 --> 10:43.111
I've enjoyed the time
we've had as a family.

11:05.078 --> 11:07.911
- What is it? What did you do?
- You almost shot me, you son of a bitch!

11:08.015 --> 11:09.004
That's because you yelled!

11:09.116 --> 11:11.984
No, you shot the gun first.
That's why I yelled!

11:12.086 --> 11:16.250
"That's why I yelled."
I'm watching you, buddy.

11:18.494 --> 11:20.155
There's gotta be some clue in here

11:20.262 --> 11:22.093
that'll tell us
where Stewie might have gone.

11:34.278 --> 11:40.308
- Wow! Look at all this cool stuff!
- Man, what do you think these things do?

11:43.055 --> 11:44.113
Guess it doesn't do anything.

11:44.222 --> 11:45.655
Well, that seems odd.

11:46.858 --> 11:50.852
- Oh, my God, Peter! You're me!
- Holy crap!

11:52.165 --> 11:53.291
Sweet!

11:59.473 --> 12:00.462
Squeeze, squeeze.

12:02.375 --> 12:04.003
What does this do?

12:08.515 --> 12:11.212
Admiral, there be whales here!

12:12.854 --> 12:14.788
All right, pull in here.

12:16.958 --> 12:19.655
The CIA. What the hell are we doing here?

12:19.762 --> 12:22.822
You'll need CIA credentials, Brian.
What do you want your alias to be?

12:22.931 --> 12:23.989
What are you talking about?
I'm not gonna...

12:24.099 --> 12:26.067
- Pick a name for yourself!
- Willem Dafoe.

12:26.168 --> 12:27.966
Not that one. I used to have
a Willem Dafoe living under my bed.

12:33.287 --> 12:35.051
Hey, you asleep yet?

12:36.858 --> 12:38.985
- No.
- Just checking.

12:52.169 --> 12:53.636
What exactly are you looking for?

12:53.771 --> 12:57.401
According to my schematics,
it should be right in here.

12:59.978 --> 13:01.843
Well, this isn't quite right, is it?

13:03.115 --> 13:04.082
Hello, gentlemen.

13:04.182 --> 13:06.811
Great day to be protecting freedom,
wouldn't you say?

13:06.919 --> 13:10.480
Yeah, US of freakin' A. We're number one.

13:10.590 --> 13:13.719
- Space shuttle and all that.
- Terrific.

13:13.827 --> 13:16.887
- Hello, Smith. How are you today?
- Fine, sir. What's new?

13:16.997 --> 13:18.760
Do you know what I heard this morning?

13:18.866 --> 13:22.064
Apparently, Rob Schneider goes down
to Home Depot...

13:22.170 --> 13:24.001
And pays the migrant workers
to come home and choke him

13:24.105 --> 13:25.129
while he masturbates in the shower.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.937
- Yeah, he's been doing that for years.
- Sick bastard.

13:36.953 --> 13:37.942
This is it, Brian.

13:38.055 --> 13:41.388
My plan for world domination
is about to come to fruition.

13:46.964 --> 13:48.431
Stewie, for God's sake,
they know we're here.

13:48.533 --> 13:49.500
What are you trying to do?

13:49.600 --> 13:51.466
Once I locate the proper code sequence,

13:51.570 --> 13:54.061
this terminal will allow me
to take command of the satellites

13:54.173 --> 13:57.336
which control the world's power grid.
Once they're under my control,

13:57.443 --> 13:59.810
the entire world will be subject
to my whims.

14:04.008 --> 14:05.134
Go away, you paperclip! No one likes you!

14:06.345 --> 14:09.508
Open up in there,
or we're breaking down the door!

14:19.559 --> 14:22.324
- I love you, Katie.
- I love you, too, Tom.

14:24.198 --> 14:26.166
Oh, my God! I'm free!

14:30.405 --> 14:32.771
The force field is down! Go! Now!

14:35.811 --> 14:39.213
- I'd drop the gun if I were you, Joe.
- What? It's Stan.

14:39.315 --> 14:41.283
Sorry,
you look sort of like someone from...

14:41.384 --> 14:43.011
Anyway, I'd drop the gun if I were you.

14:43.119 --> 14:45.884
I now control
the entire planet's power grid,

14:45.989 --> 14:48.617
and unless you want me
to send you all back to the Dark Ages,

14:48.725 --> 14:50.784
you'll do exactly as I say.

14:51.995 --> 14:53.258
What are your demands?

14:57.268 --> 14:59.566
We interrupt this program
to bring you a special message

14:59.671 --> 15:01.537
from the new president of the world.

15:01.740 --> 15:03.264
Greetings, loyal minions.

15:04.443 --> 15:06.240
- Stewie?
- Oh, my God!

15:06.345 --> 15:07.312
What the hell!

15:07.413 --> 15:08.438
Good gravy!

15:08.548 --> 15:11.142
<i>Señor Rob Schneider,
you must come see the news!</i>

15:11.251 --> 15:14.687
I'm not paying you guys to watch TV.
Now get in the damn shower!

15:22.463 --> 15:23.453
Brian, come here.

15:23.565 --> 15:26.432
I want you to hear my presidential address
for St. Rupert's Day.

15:26.535 --> 15:28.935
I'm unveiling all the new laws
I have passed.

15:29.071 --> 15:32.269
Screw off. I don't want anything to do
with you or your damn laws.

15:32.575 --> 15:33.837
Just take a look, will you?

15:35.912 --> 15:38.313
You're banning straight-to-video
Disney films?

15:38.415 --> 15:43.580
<i>Absolutely. I mean, look at this.
Jafar May Need Glasses.</i>

15:44.054 --> 15:46.182
Number one, number two.

15:49.561 --> 15:51.825
Number one, number two.

15:53.699 --> 15:56.793
About the same.
Number one might be a tiny bit better.

15:56.903 --> 16:01.101
- Number three, number four.
- Number three.

16:01.207 --> 16:03.369
Five and six.

16:06.914 --> 16:09.110
Five and six.

16:12.687 --> 16:13.881
About the same?

16:13.988 --> 16:17.322
Yeah, they're pretty much...
Can I see five one more time?

16:17.426 --> 16:21.385
- Five and six.
- Yeah, they're about the same.

16:23.832 --> 16:24.857
Greetings, unwashed masses.

16:26.505 --> 16:29.235
The following laws
will go into effect immediately.

16:29.341 --> 16:32.209
Henceforth, sexual intercourse is illegal.

16:32.311 --> 16:35.474
It is gross and disgusting
and punishable by death.

16:35.848 --> 16:39.808
Origami keeps my hands busy
and my mind off sex.

16:39.920 --> 16:44.755
There we go. I made a swan.
Stewie's a good leader.

16:45.659 --> 16:48.993
I wonder how many of these swans
I can fit in my bum.

16:49.631 --> 16:51.462
In addition, from this day forward,

16:51.566 --> 16:53.466
all the nation's milk
must come from Hilary Swank's breasts.

16:55.456 --> 16:59.085
Hey, I don't give a damn what you want.
Just get the hell off of my property!

16:59.193 --> 17:01.787
Look, Hilary,
all I know is, it's breakfast time,

17:01.896 --> 17:04.888
I've got this bowl of cornflakes,
and I gotta be at work at 9:00.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.332
- So what are we gonna do here?
- Not so fast.

17:07.435 --> 17:10.463
Did you know you'd have
to eat 17 bowls of those cornflakes

17:10.573 --> 17:13.736
to get the same nutritional value
in one bowl of Total?

17:13.843 --> 17:16.641
Say, that's a lot easier
than eating 17 bowls!

17:16.746 --> 17:19.944
- And it's easier on my breasts!
- Everybody wins!

17:21.050 --> 17:24.714
<i>Hilary Swank
Get your milk from her</i>

17:24.821 --> 17:25.790
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

17:26.391 --> 17:29.292
Also, as I've had quite enough
of the fat man,

17:29.394 --> 17:32.386
anyone who sees Peter Griffin
must throw apples at him.

17:33.298 --> 17:34.664
Yeah, I'd like to make a deposit.
What the hell?

17:34.767 --> 17:35.756
It's the law, sir.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.618
Now, I have no doubt

17:38.724 --> 17:41.694
that perhaps there may exist some
mild discontent amongst some of you

17:41.795 --> 17:43.888
at the recent changes I have implemented.

17:43.997 --> 17:46.227
Lest you be considering
any sort of uprising,

17:46.333 --> 17:48.802
I warn you,
I am quite prepared to make an example

17:48.903 --> 17:53.067
of any undesirable elements.
And don't think I don't know who you are.

17:53.441 --> 17:56.969
<i>As someday it may happen
That a victim must be found</i>

17:57.079 --> 18:00.139
<i>I've got a little list
I've got a little list</i>

18:00.249 --> 18:03.685
<i>Of society offenders
Who might well be underground</i>

18:03.786 --> 18:06.915
<i>And who never would be missed
Who never would be missed</i>

18:07.023 --> 18:08.854
<i>There's the white kid
With the baggy clothes</i>

18:08.959 --> 18:10.483
<i>Who's talking like he's black</i>

18:10.593 --> 18:13.859
<i>The girl you date who doesn't get
The jokes in Caddyshack</i>

18:13.965 --> 18:17.264
<i>The Asian guy who cuts in front
Of every single line</i>

18:17.368 --> 18:20.736
<i>And Britney Spears
For accidentally showing her vagine</i>

18:20.839 --> 18:24.070
<i>And Bill O'Reilly's
Ineffective dermatologist</i>

18:24.176 --> 18:27.476
<i>They'd none of them be missed
They'd none of them be missed</i>

18:27.580 --> 18:30.515
<i>He's got them on the list
He's got them on the list</i>

18:30.616 --> 18:34.780
<i>And they'd none of them be missed
They'd none of them be missed</i>

18:40.961 --> 18:44.523
<i>There's the guy behind the news reporter
Waving like a fool</i>

18:44.632 --> 18:47.760
<i>And senator Bill Frist
I've got him on the list</i>

18:47.869 --> 18:51.499
<i>And the fat kid smiling warmly
While he's peeing in the pool</i>

18:51.607 --> 18:54.770
<i>He never would be missed
He never would be missed</i>

18:54.877 --> 18:58.541
<i>There's the foul-smelling boy
Who comes to school in camouflage</i>

18:58.648 --> 19:01.947
<i>And every bleeding member
Of the cast ofEntourage</i>

19:02.052 --> 19:05.419
<i>And while we're on the subject
HBO deserves a whack</i>

19:05.523 --> 19:08.924
<i>For ending The Sopranos
With a fucking cut to black</i>

19:09.027 --> 19:12.360
<i>And guys who when you shake their hand
Just bump you with their fist</i>

19:12.463 --> 19:15.763
<i>I don't think they'd be missed
I'm sure they'd not be missed</i>

19:15.868 --> 19:19.065
<i>He's got them on the list
He's got them on the list</i>

19:19.171 --> 19:23.541
<i>And they'd none of them be missed
They'd none of them be missed</i>

19:26.146 --> 19:29.583
<i>There's the guy who sits beside you
And keeps farting on the plane</i>

19:29.683 --> 19:32.982
<i>And Shakira 's lyricist
I've got him on the list</i>

19:33.087 --> 19:36.717
<i>And the smarty on Thanksgiving
Who says it's the tryptophane</i>

19:36.825 --> 19:39.988
<i>He never would be missed
He never would be missed</i>

19:40.095 --> 19:43.690
<i>There's the blonde who tells you loudly
With a voice just like a knife</i>

19:43.799 --> 19:47.236
<i>'"You know, someone should do a sitcom
Based around my life'"</i>

19:47.336 --> 19:50.669
<i>The guy who watchedThe Simpsons
Back in 1994</i>

19:50.773 --> 19:53.937
<i>And won't admit the damn thing
Isn't funny anymore</i>

19:54.244 --> 20:00.013
<i>And anyone and everyone
Who's ever made me pissed!</i>

20:00.118 --> 20:02.609
<i>Made me pissed
Made me really, really pissed</i>

20:02.720 --> 20:05.382
<i>I've got them on the list</i>

20:06.224 --> 20:11.754
<i>They'd none of them be missed!</i>

20:11.864 --> 20:14.766
<i>He's got them on the list
He's got them on the list</i>

20:14.868 --> 20:16.460
<i>And they'd none of them be missed</i>

20:16.570 --> 20:21.303
<i>They'd none of them be missed</i>

20:21.408 --> 20:23.240
<i>None of them be missed</i>

20:24.412 --> 20:26.141
That is enough!

20:26.247 --> 20:27.942
Peter, I am not gonna stand by

20:28.049 --> 20:31.019
while other people suffer
at the hands of my own baby.

20:31.120 --> 20:35.352
I brought Stewie into this world.
It's time for me to take him out.

20:35.457 --> 20:36.424
How the hell are you gonna do...

20:37.593 --> 20:38.561
Sorry, Dad!

20:38.661 --> 20:41.824
That's okay, Chris.
You're a good boy following the law.

20:41.931 --> 20:43.558
But you, Meg, you're going to jail.

21:00.088 --> 21:03.058
All right, Peter, I'm going to kill Stewie.
Dinner's in the oven.

21:03.158 --> 21:06.184
All you have to do is turn it to 350
at about 5:15.

21:06.295 --> 21:08.058
- Yeah, okay, Lois.
- Are you listening?

21:08.163 --> 21:09.461
- Yeah.
- What did I just say?

21:09.566 --> 21:11.830
Turn the oven to 350 at 5:15. I heard it!

21:14.638 --> 21:16.834
All right, sir,
your presidential portrait is finished.

21:16.941 --> 21:17.965
Let me see.

21:19.110 --> 21:20.338
Excellent.

21:20.444 --> 21:23.242
Much better than the one Gary Larson did.

21:24.583 --> 21:27.347
Why would I even be talking to a chicken?

21:31.023 --> 21:32.013
Lois!

21:32.125 --> 21:35.686
Stewie, your reign of terror
has come to an end.

21:35.795 --> 21:39.288
I will not stand by
while you make innocent people suffer.

21:39.400 --> 21:43.336
Bring it on, bitch. Time for me to finish
what I started anyway.

23:17.977 --> 23:23.314
Go ahead, Lois, do it. Shoot me.
Shoot your little baby Stewie.

23:30.525 --> 23:35.691
I can't do it. You're a terrible, evil child,
but you're still my baby,

23:35.798 --> 23:38.460
and I could never hurt you.

23:38.567 --> 23:40.899
Well, that works out perfectly,
because I can hurt you.

23:41.003 --> 23:43.905
Say hi to Cleveland for me.
Oh, and Mr. Weed.

23:53.784 --> 23:56.981
It's just been revoked.

23:57.087 --> 23:59.579
<i>Peter, he didn't really set you up
for that Lethal Weapon line.</i>

23:59.691 --> 24:01.090
It doesn't really work here.

24:02.294 --> 24:05.128
I'll have what she's having.

24:05.231 --> 24:07.199
That's better.

24:28.657 --> 24:31.592
Hey, Stewie, we got a postcard
from Peter and Lois on the cruise.

24:31.694 --> 24:32.991
What are you doing?

24:33.095 --> 24:36.031
Oh, hello, Brian.
Well, you recall my complaining about Lois

24:36.132 --> 24:38.430
- and the fat man not taking me with them?
- Yeah.

24:38.535 --> 24:41.129
Yes, well,
you said I didn't have it in me to kill Lois,

24:41.238 --> 24:44.504
so I was just running a simulation
to find out exactly how killing her

24:44.609 --> 24:46.509
and taking over the world
would play out for me.

24:46.611 --> 24:50.308
- Yeah? How'd that go?
- Not well, Brian. Not well.

24:50.414 --> 24:54.146
I suppose I'm not ready to kill Lois
or take over the world.

24:54.253 --> 24:55.220
Yet.

24:55.320 --> 24:57.720
So, what you're saying is
that what you experienced

24:57.823 --> 25:00.657
in the simulation
didn't really happen or even matter.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.729
- Yes, that's correct.
- So it was sort of like a dream.

25:03.830 --> 25:05.229
No, it was a simulation.

25:05.331 --> 25:07.960
Yes, but theoretically,
if someone watched the events

25:08.068 --> 25:10.229
of that simulation from start to finish,

25:10.337 --> 25:12.669
only to find out
that none of it really happened...

25:12.773 --> 25:17.108
I mean, you don't think that would be
just like a giant middle finger to them?

25:17.212 --> 25:19.908
Well, hopefully,
they would have enjoyed the ride.

25:20.015 --> 25:23.383
I don't know, man. I think you piss
a lot of people off that way.

25:23.486 --> 25:25.351
<i>Well, at least it didn't end
like The Sopranos,</i>

25:25.454 --> 25:27.081
where it just cut to black in mid...
