WEBVTT

00:50.633 --> 00:52.886
I guess someone got the romance going.

00:52.969 --> 00:54.220
It's unnecessarily pretty.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.473
-It really is pretty.
-Hey--

01:21.081 --> 01:22.415
I nearly died just now.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.084
Death was right in my face.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.835
-What?
-What?

01:28.004 --> 01:31.090
I've been looking everywhere for you.
I finally found you.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.592
Seong-hyeon?

01:32.675 --> 01:34.427
It's been a while, Hye-jin.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.975
I don't know what's going on,

01:41.059 --> 01:44.145
-but will you get me up first?
-Sorry.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.071
What are you doing here?

01:53.154 --> 01:55.782
We meet again. Hold on a second.

01:55.865 --> 01:59.327
I just saved your life, didn't I?
We're even now, right?

01:59.410 --> 02:02.831
I guess. But you didn't
have to repay me all at once.

02:03.414 --> 02:05.792
You see, I don't like being in debt.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.378
Anyway, this is incredible.
What a coincidence.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.505
I know.

02:10.588 --> 02:13.967
Do you two know each other?

02:14.050 --> 02:15.218
You two know each other?

02:15.301 --> 02:16.219
And you two?

02:19.222 --> 02:22.308
You wandered off again.
Maybe I should get you an ID bracelet?

02:22.392 --> 02:25.270
This is assault.
Maybe I should get you arrested.

02:25.353 --> 02:27.522
Be quiet. The village chief is waiting.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.315
-Let's go.
-Right now?

02:29.399 --> 02:30.859
Chief Hong, come with us.

02:30.942 --> 02:32.110
Sure.

02:32.193 --> 02:33.903
By the way, who are you?

02:36.531 --> 02:39.033
It's me. Wang Ji-won, the writer.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.579
You don't remember
after spending two days together?

02:48.418 --> 02:49.335
It's okay.

02:49.419 --> 02:53.006
I can sometimes look totally different.
I did <i>Get Me Beauty</i> for many years.

02:53.089 --> 02:55.466
You look totally…

02:55.550 --> 02:57.260
Have you two been introduced?

02:57.343 --> 02:59.971
This is Chief Hong,
who guided me around Gongjin.

03:00.054 --> 03:00.889
And this is

03:01.556 --> 03:04.058
OVN's troublemaker and…

03:04.142 --> 03:07.353
…star director, Ji Seong-hyeon.

03:07.437 --> 03:11.441
Hello, I'm Ji Seong-hyeon.
Nice to meet you all.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.695
Aren't you the young man
who came by my house?

03:15.778 --> 03:17.780
-Who?
-Everyone.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.283
Today we're in Gongjin to visit

03:20.366 --> 03:23.995
the oldest fresh pollack soup restaurant
in the country.

03:24.579 --> 03:27.790
We explore the oldest restaurants
throughout the country.

03:27.874 --> 03:28.791
Who are we?

03:28.875 --> 03:30.293
-<i>The First Taste Ever</i>.
-<i>The First Taste Ever</i>.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.294
That's right.

03:31.377 --> 03:35.548
Can you guess what goes into
the dish you're having?

03:35.632 --> 03:36.841
-Water celery.
-Chives.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.384
-Tofu?
-Radish?

03:38.468 --> 03:39.928
-Chili powder.
-Crown daisy.

03:40.428 --> 03:41.471
-Rice wine.
-Soy sauce.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.975
No one has guessed
the most important ingredient yet.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.810
-Fresh pollack.
-Oh, right.

03:47.894 --> 03:48.811
That's right.

03:48.895 --> 03:49.812
Correct!

03:49.896 --> 03:52.982
What's the food show
where you have to guess the ingredients?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.442
<i>We Eat Anything</i>.

03:54.525 --> 03:56.945
-You're incredible.
-That's right.

03:57.028 --> 03:59.280
And this man here is
the director of that show.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.406
-Oh, my.
-Hey.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.867
I knew it. I did think he looked familiar.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.911
And what brings you here to Gongjin?

04:04.994 --> 04:07.789
Well, I'm planning to shoot
a new variety show

04:07.872 --> 04:11.542
named <i>The Seashore Grasshopper</i> in Gongjin.

04:11.626 --> 04:15.421
We'll try our best not to cause
any inconvenience for you.

04:15.505 --> 04:18.258
I hope you'll understand. Thank you.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.719
And that means

04:21.803 --> 04:25.682
our town, Gongjin, will be on TV.

04:25.765 --> 04:26.933
You have no idea how--

04:27.016 --> 04:31.354
Mr. Ji, next time, come to my restaurant.
I'll serve you the best <i>jjajangmyeon</i> ever.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.982
-Okay, I--
-A team dinner would be even better…

04:34.065 --> 04:36.317
Ms. Dentist, how do you know him?

04:36.901 --> 04:38.695
We went to college together.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.447
-What about you?
-We met on the street.

04:41.531 --> 04:44.492
You could say
our relationship is based on lies.

04:44.575 --> 04:45.576
What?

04:45.660 --> 04:46.786
Wait a second.

04:47.745 --> 04:49.872
So he really knows Baek Jong-won?

04:50.790 --> 04:51.624
There you go.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.584
-Give me your business card.
-Attention.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.712
I'll book a table for your team.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.756
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

04:58.840 --> 05:00.508
-I can't believe you.
-Eat up.

05:00.591 --> 05:02.218
Will you stop?

05:02.302 --> 05:03.803
-By the way--
-Excuse me.

05:03.886 --> 05:05.346
-I'll be right back.
-Sure.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.306
Thank you.

05:06.389 --> 05:07.640
Go ahead.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.976
-What did I do?
-How could you say that?

05:10.059 --> 05:12.854
-Don't be like that.
-Stop it, both of you.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.190
Sorry it took me so long.

05:16.274 --> 05:19.527
Don't worry.
You were popular back in college too.

05:19.610 --> 05:20.570
Gosh.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.405
How long has it been?

05:22.989 --> 05:24.073
Ten years?

05:24.157 --> 05:27.869
Ms. Dentist, let me steal this guy
from you for a second.

05:27.952 --> 05:30.204
I'd like for you to explain something.

05:31.622 --> 05:34.125
You knew I got the wrong idea.
Why didn't you tell me?

05:34.208 --> 05:36.878
Because there's not
much of a difference anyway.

05:36.961 --> 05:39.505
I visit restaurants
and analyze the flavors.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.674
What I do is basically <i>mukbang</i> shows.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.844
Besides, I got to get some valuable advice
from you thanks to that.

05:44.927 --> 05:47.180
It was quite valuable, right?

05:47.764 --> 05:49.432
Anyway, nice to see you again.

05:49.515 --> 05:52.226
You too.
Will you let me talk to Hye-jin now?

05:52.310 --> 05:53.478
She's all yours.

05:53.561 --> 05:58.399
The other day, I saw someone who looked
just like you and followed her.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.485
It must've been you.

06:00.568 --> 06:02.737
-Really?
-Yes!

06:02.820 --> 06:04.072
What are you doing here?

06:04.155 --> 06:07.617
I opened a clinic here. Recently.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.827
-Yoon Dental Clinic?
-How do you know?

06:09.911 --> 06:12.038
Unbelievable. I just happened to see it.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.915
-I even took a picture.
-Really?

06:13.998 --> 06:15.041
Is that your clinic?

06:15.124 --> 06:17.752
-Yes--
-I found the spot and renovated it myself.

06:17.835 --> 06:19.545
-Is that how you met?
-Exactly.

06:19.629 --> 06:22.590
Well, yes. That's what happened.

06:22.673 --> 06:24.383
My goodness.

06:24.467 --> 06:28.346
Mr. Ji. Dr. Yoon. Do you know each other?
You seem pretty close.

06:28.429 --> 06:30.473
-We went to college together.
-I see.

06:30.556 --> 06:34.060
But you seem to be
more than just college friends.

06:34.143 --> 06:37.897
Is it just me or is there something
going on between you two?

06:37.980 --> 06:39.899
It's not like that. Seriously.

06:39.982 --> 06:42.193
-It's not like that.
-Why are you so upset?

06:42.276 --> 06:44.612
What is it? Did I guess right?

06:44.695 --> 06:48.074
It's not like that.
She's just a friend I really care about.

06:48.157 --> 06:49.283
A friend you care about?

06:49.367 --> 06:52.078
See? I knew you weren't just friends.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.332
Hey, wait. I'm not finished yet.

06:56.415 --> 06:59.919
You were talking the entire time,
so I assumed you were done.

07:00.002 --> 07:01.295
I'm not. Put it back down.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.339
Hey, you have water celery in your teeth.

07:03.422 --> 07:04.423
Oh, my.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.217
Did you enjoy the soup so much?

07:06.300 --> 07:07.260
That little…

07:08.094 --> 07:11.430
I'm sorry, but I have to work tomorrow.
I'll get going now.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.599
Since when was that a problem?

07:13.683 --> 07:14.642
Be quiet.

07:15.643 --> 07:18.229
Hye-jin, where do you live?
Let me walk you home.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.898
No, I live close by. It's okay.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.736
-He's walking her home.
-Whatever.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.572
I'm stepping out for some air.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.949
-All right.
-I'll be right back.

07:30.032 --> 07:32.368
-Are you leaving too?
-I'll get going.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.953
-What?
-Where are you going?

07:34.036 --> 07:35.121
Move.

07:35.204 --> 07:37.748
-Are you going home?
-Yes. See you.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.334
Why did you have to sit there
and mess everything up?

07:40.418 --> 07:41.836
-Let's all go home.
-They all suddenly left.

07:43.337 --> 07:45.047
This is really unnecessary.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.174
Exactly.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.427
She lives just around the corner.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.680
Then why are you following me?

07:52.763 --> 07:56.225
I'm not following you.
I'm just worried about that guy.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.186
He might get lost on his way back.

07:59.979 --> 08:00.980
That makes sense.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.941
Hey, I'm not that hopeless.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.360
-Yes, you are.
-You are.

08:06.444 --> 08:10.031
How many times did you get lost on campus
and I had to help you out?

08:11.782 --> 08:12.700
That's true.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.368
Listen, I have an idea.

08:14.452 --> 08:17.747
After taking Ms. Dentist home,
how about you and I grab a drink?

08:17.830 --> 08:18.956
Sounds good.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.666
-What is this?
-What?

08:20.750 --> 08:23.294
Why would you go for a drink without me?

08:23.920 --> 08:25.671
You said you have to work tomorrow.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.633
I can stay out until midnight.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.885
This is where Chief Hong lives.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.096
Let's go in.

08:35.598 --> 08:36.807
Is this your house?

08:36.891 --> 08:37.934
Isn't it amazing?

08:39.435 --> 08:41.062
It has such a fantastic view.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.358
The place looks great.
You have good taste.

08:45.942 --> 08:49.904
From the furniture to the lamps,
I put everything together.

08:49.987 --> 08:53.324
I painted, hung, made,
and bought everything in here.

08:53.407 --> 08:54.408
All by myself.

08:54.492 --> 08:57.078
Did you make all these liquors
yourself too?

08:57.161 --> 08:58.079
Of course.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.456
It's my collection.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.501
Liquors on the bottom shelves,
and teas on the top shelves.

09:03.584 --> 09:06.003
What's this empty space for?

09:06.754 --> 09:10.258
Oh, that? I had an unwelcome guest over.

09:10.341 --> 09:13.761
It was for a bottle of ginseng liquor
that had aged for a whole year.

09:13.844 --> 09:16.430
Seong-hyeon. Hey.

09:17.348 --> 09:18.474
Have a seat.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.893
I was thinking of helping him.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.521
It's okay. Don't worry about Chief Hong.

09:23.604 --> 09:26.691
He can do everything on his own.

09:26.774 --> 09:29.151
That's right. Go ahead and have a seat.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.069
Okay.

09:30.152 --> 09:32.655
-By the way, where's the bathroom?
-Seong-hyeon.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.448
Open that door and you'll find it.

09:35.783 --> 09:38.035
I see. Okay.

09:47.378 --> 09:50.673
Why did you want to bring him here
without me?

09:51.257 --> 09:52.258
To talk about me?

09:52.341 --> 09:55.011
Sometimes, doctors don't realize
their own disease.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.846
-What?
-You should see a doctor.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.889
You seem to be excessively self-conscious.

09:58.973 --> 10:02.643
Let go of the delusion
that everyone is interested in you.

10:02.727 --> 10:06.105
Whatever. And not a word to him, okay?

10:06.188 --> 10:08.608
Especially about that night.

10:08.691 --> 10:11.402
Oh, you mean our biological crisis--

10:11.485 --> 10:13.487
-Stop it.
-Hey, I'm holding a knife.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.323
-It's dangerous.
-I'll hit you here.

10:15.406 --> 10:16.616
-Careful.
-What are you doing?

10:21.871 --> 10:23.956
-Are you done?
-Yes.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.876
Well, let's go sit on the sofa.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.045
The sofa here is extremely comfy.

10:34.675 --> 10:35.718
Officer Choi.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.054
Ms. Pyo.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.016
Aren't you off duty? Why are you so busy?

10:42.099 --> 10:44.268
-I've been waiting for you.
-For me?

10:45.186 --> 10:46.771
-Why?
-What?

10:49.690 --> 10:51.192
Well, I…

10:52.526 --> 10:54.028
Hey.

10:54.111 --> 10:56.113
Why don't we have that together?

10:56.197 --> 10:58.699
I love rotisserie chicken.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.702
I'm sorry.
I don't eat anything after 6 p.m.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.997
I see. You're on a diet?

11:05.956 --> 11:09.293
No wonder you're so fit.

11:10.544 --> 11:13.673
-Then should we take a walk--
-Gosh, who did this?

11:13.756 --> 11:14.632
Pardon?

11:16.217 --> 11:17.718
Jeez.

11:20.388 --> 11:21.347
What are you doing?

11:21.430 --> 11:23.516
It's illegal to put these up here.

11:23.599 --> 11:25.184
Whoever did this,

11:25.267 --> 11:28.854
they didn't know it's against
Article 3 of the Minor Offenses Act.

11:28.938 --> 11:32.775
You must've been born to be a cop.

11:32.858 --> 11:33.901
Thank you.

11:33.984 --> 11:36.028
Gosh, it won't come off.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.738
Hold on.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.033
Let me see.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.078
How about now?

11:44.161 --> 11:46.747
It's probably easier to scrape it off
when it's wet.

11:47.456 --> 11:49.166
Isn't that expensive?

11:50.501 --> 11:53.295
No, it's not expensive at all.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.714
Should I spray some more?

11:55.798 --> 11:58.050
Yes, please. Spray generously.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.135
-Generously?
-Yes.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.345
Over here. Where you just sprayed.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.180
-Here?
-Yes.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.683
Spray generously all over, please.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.852
How much does one of these cost?

12:07.935 --> 12:10.688
I think I paid 67,000 won.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.398
What? 67,000…

12:13.566 --> 12:16.360
Did you say… What are you thinking?

12:17.361 --> 12:18.779
-It's fine.
-But…

12:20.072 --> 12:20.990
Why didn't you…

12:21.490 --> 12:23.367
Finally.

12:24.952 --> 12:26.162
Dig in.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.747
It looks fancy. And you work so fast.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.500
-Tell me if you need more.
-Look at the shrimp.

12:32.626 --> 12:34.628
Just soju and beer?

12:35.212 --> 12:37.173
Not going to share
your collection with us?

12:37.256 --> 12:39.383
We'll start with these.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.177
After drinking them with some food,

12:41.260 --> 12:45.473
we'll switch to my homemade liquor
when we can genuinely appreciate it.

12:45.556 --> 12:48.350
-Sounds like a plan.
-Allergic to shrimp, by any chance?

12:48.434 --> 12:52.354
In the past 34 years and 2 months,
I haven't found anything that I can't eat.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.107
Hold on. 34 years and 2 months?

12:55.191 --> 12:57.943
-We're the same age.
-We are?

12:58.027 --> 13:00.905
-Let's be friends.
-Yes, let's.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.283
You're suddenly friends?

13:04.867 --> 13:07.995
-Of course, why not?
-Exactly.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.789
-Let me make some <i>somaek</i> for you.
-Please.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.253
-Hey, stop!
-Chief Hong!

13:16.337 --> 13:18.464
-Are you crazy?
-That's too much beer!

13:18.547 --> 13:20.049
What are you talking about?

13:20.132 --> 13:23.761
I followed the nation's favorite ratio,
the golden ratio of 7:3.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.679
Come on. You don't understand.

13:25.763 --> 13:28.974
To fully enjoy the soft and clean flavors
of soju,

13:29.058 --> 13:31.602
-the ratio should be 6:4.
-Well said.

13:31.685 --> 13:32.895
Is that your favorite?

13:32.978 --> 13:34.063
-Of course.
-Mine too.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.065
-Good.
-Then make some for yourselves.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.316
I'll do it for you.

13:37.399 --> 13:40.152
-You will?
-All right. Let's see here.

13:41.153 --> 13:42.988
One, two, three, four.

13:43.697 --> 13:46.784
-One, two, three, four.
-There you go.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.120
You're very meticulous.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.457
Okay. One second.

13:53.541 --> 13:54.583
Watch this.

13:56.794 --> 13:59.046
-Here you go.
-You're so good.

13:59.129 --> 14:00.464
He spilled it everywhere.

14:00.548 --> 14:01.924
It's no big deal.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.384
All right. Let's drink.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.303
-Ch-- Oh…
-Ch--

14:06.387 --> 14:08.597
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

14:08.681 --> 14:09.765
Cheers.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.480
-This is nice.
-It's smooth.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.692
Hye-jin, you still don't finish
the first glass at once?

14:19.775 --> 14:20.693
You remember that?

14:20.776 --> 14:23.779
You always drank the first three glasses
slowly to warm up.

14:23.862 --> 14:26.657
God, you haven't changed a bit.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.993
-I don't think so.
-She's always been like this?

14:29.076 --> 14:31.370
Yes, she's still the same person
I used to know.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.455
Opening a clinic here and everything.

14:34.039 --> 14:34.957
-What?
-What?

14:35.040 --> 14:36.500
Instead of chasing big goals,

14:36.584 --> 14:40.629
you probably opened it here
to help those who really need you.

14:41.630 --> 14:44.675
I hear the countryside has
a lot fewer clinics than Seoul.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.427
This is so like you, Hye-jin.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.221
Are we really talking
about the same person?

14:49.305 --> 14:50.639
The Ms. Dentist I know--

14:51.891 --> 14:53.934
-What's with you?
-Sorry.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.270
My leg fell asleep,
so I had to straighten it.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.647
I didn't mean to touch your foot.
I'm sorry.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.774
But that felt pretty intentional.

15:00.858 --> 15:03.903
Wow, this gambas looks really delicious.

15:03.986 --> 15:06.196
It would go well with wine.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.741
-You like wine too?
-Yes, I love it.

15:08.824 --> 15:09.909
What kind?

15:09.992 --> 15:13.621
I like Burgundy wines. Pinot noir.

15:13.704 --> 15:15.164
-For real?
-Yes.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.624
Me too.

15:16.707 --> 15:20.044
-Really?
-They are soft and have the right acidity,

15:20.127 --> 15:22.046
-so they go well with food.
-Right?

15:22.129 --> 15:23.047
-Yes.
-Come on.

15:23.130 --> 15:26.050
Burgundy wines are too bland.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.801
Bordeaux wines are superior.

15:27.885 --> 15:31.805
The richness of
the Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot blend.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.099
You said you didn't know much about wine.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.601
It's just…

15:36.518 --> 15:37.770
I'm just saying.

15:37.853 --> 15:38.854
Okay.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.900
Time flies.

15:42.983 --> 15:45.444
Yoon Hye-jin likes wine now?

15:46.528 --> 15:50.115
The Yoon Hye-jin I remember
liked comic books and <i>tteokbokki</i>.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.326
I still like them.
Especially spicy <i>tteokbokki</i>.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.995
-Spicy <i>tteokbokki</i>?
-Yes.

15:55.079 --> 15:58.958
Me too. I know an amazing restaurant
near my workplace.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.043
I eat it every time I'm editing.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.545
-It's nice and spicy.
-Is it good?

16:03.629 --> 16:06.715
I don't understand
why people like <i>tteokbokki</i> so much.

16:10.844 --> 16:11.679
What?

16:13.639 --> 16:15.057
What about comic books?

16:15.140 --> 16:18.894
These days, I've switched to webtoons.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.523
But they definitely lack
the sentiment of paperbacks.

16:22.606 --> 16:25.401
I agree.
The texture, the smell, and everything.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.903
I'm still holed up in comic book cafés
when I'm free.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.697
-Really?
-Yes. Oh, right.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.741
Have you heard
that Seok-hun is married with kids now?

16:33.367 --> 16:35.160
-He got married?
-Yes!

16:35.828 --> 16:37.621
-I'll show you some pictures.
-Please.

16:39.623 --> 16:41.709
-Here.
-How cute.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.293
My goodness. Is it a girl?

16:43.377 --> 16:45.671
-Yes. She's adorable.
-She's really cute.

16:45.754 --> 16:47.297
-Cute.
-She looks like Seok-hun.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.299
-Yes. She just turned one.
-Adorable.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.265
Now that we're friends,

16:56.974 --> 16:58.434
can I ask you a favor?

16:59.184 --> 17:00.561
Sure, let's hear it.

17:00.644 --> 17:03.689
-Please be my team's guide.
-What?

17:03.772 --> 17:06.984
Ms. Wang said you were very helpful.

17:07.067 --> 17:09.903
What do you say?
Do you want to work with me?

17:09.987 --> 17:12.906
I'm not sure. I'm pretty busy.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.659
Yes, Chief Hong is way too busy.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.245
That only makes me more desperate.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.292
How about we play a game to decide?

17:23.375 --> 17:24.877
-A game?
-Yes.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.379
If I win, you'll accept my offer.

17:27.463 --> 17:30.090
If you win, I'll give up.

17:30.174 --> 17:32.468
-What's in it for--
-Hold on.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.303
I'll prepare the game.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.765
-Seong-hyeon.
-What are you thinking?

17:37.848 --> 17:39.308
What are you going to do?

17:39.391 --> 17:41.477
Why are you going through my stuff?

17:43.020 --> 17:45.439
Okay. Let the game begin.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.650
One of them is normal Americano.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.945
The other is Americano
with sand lance sauce.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.908
We'll guess which one
is the normal Americano.

17:55.991 --> 17:57.576
I've seen it on TV.

17:57.659 --> 18:01.038
I'm sure you have.
I have a feeling you're familiar with it.

18:01.121 --> 18:04.333
Just by looking at them,
it's impossible to tell them apart.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.087
To make sure it's fair,
I'll ask you to shuffle them.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.130
-Me?
-Yes.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.257
-This guy scares me.
-Please.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.093
-I mean…
-He's too enthusiastic.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.344
Why are we doing this?

18:17.262 --> 18:18.263
I'll shuffle them.

18:18.847 --> 18:20.599
I'm a little nervous.

18:25.104 --> 18:25.979
Here you go.

18:27.731 --> 18:30.109
-Stay away.
-Gosh, you startled me.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.235
You can't smell them.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.529
What's with you? I get it.

18:33.612 --> 18:36.115
-All right.
-Goodness, you scare me.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.117
-I'll pick one.
-Go ahead.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.744
Go ahead and pick one.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.414
The one on the right.

18:45.332 --> 18:46.625
Then I choose the left.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.546
Well then.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.090
Let's start.

18:54.424 --> 18:55.509
My goodness.

18:59.346 --> 19:01.640
What's going on?
Chief Hong, did you get coffee?

19:01.723 --> 19:04.309
Both of them can't be coffee, right?

19:04.393 --> 19:05.769
Mine is coffee.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.897
Are you going to drink it?

19:09.940 --> 19:11.358
Look at his eyes.

19:11.441 --> 19:12.901
Seong-hyeon.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.988
There's a whole lot of
sand lance sauce in there. Oh, my.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.323
Damn.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.331
-Jesus!
-Oh, dear.

19:28.041 --> 19:30.085
There were about 36,000 sand lances
in there.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.712
Are you okay? Gosh, it stinks.

19:31.795 --> 19:33.255
I finished it, so it's a tie.

19:34.840 --> 19:35.674
Next!

19:35.757 --> 19:36.592
<i>-Tang.
-Su.</i>

19:36.675 --> 19:37.509
<i>-Yuk.
-Tang.</i>

19:37.593 --> 19:38.427
<i>-Su.
-Yuk.</i>

19:38.510 --> 19:39.511
<i>Tang.</i>

19:42.181 --> 19:43.348
It's never going to end!

19:43.432 --> 19:44.474
Next game.

19:44.558 --> 19:45.726
<i>Yorkshire Terrier</i>

19:45.809 --> 19:46.852
<i>Yorkshire Terrier</i>

19:46.935 --> 19:47.978
<i>Yorkshire Terrier</i>

19:48.061 --> 19:49.188
<i>Yorkshire Terrier</i>

19:49.271 --> 19:50.439
<i>Yorkshire Terrier</i>

19:50.522 --> 19:51.481
<i>Yorkshire Terrier</i>

19:51.565 --> 19:53.192
<i>Yorkshire Terrier</i>

19:53.275 --> 19:54.776
<i>Yorkshire Terrier</i>

19:54.860 --> 19:56.403
<i>Yorkshire Terrier</i>

19:57.070 --> 19:59.072
Next, Golden Retriever. Start.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.032
<i>Golden Retriever…</i>

20:01.158 --> 20:02.117
Strawberry, three.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.786
Strawberry, strawberry, strawberry.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.539
Strawberry, seven.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.416
Strawberry, strawberry, strawberry,

20:09.499 --> 20:11.585
strawberry, strawberry,
strawberry, strawberry.

20:12.669 --> 20:14.004
Strawberry, five.

20:15.631 --> 20:18.675
Strawberry, strawberry, strawberry,
strawberry, strawberry…

20:18.759 --> 20:21.803
I'll do it. I'll be your team's guide.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.347
Let's stop.

20:23.430 --> 20:26.350
I don't want to decide this way.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.685
I want a fair result.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.898
Now let's see who can put
the most clothespins on his face.

20:32.981 --> 20:35.400
Damn it.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.944
Please stop.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.747
Seong-hyeon is drunk.

20:49.831 --> 20:52.626
Where's Chief Hong?

20:56.588 --> 20:59.007
I should go home.

21:14.064 --> 21:15.399
Chief Hong.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.991
You're so heavy! Gosh.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.868
You'll freeze to death
if you sleep outside.

21:27.411 --> 21:30.956
Chief Hong, I saved your life.

21:34.334 --> 21:35.585
I'm going home.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.365
Darn it.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.708
<i>Why is it
Everything's so hard</i>…

22:14.791 --> 22:17.836
I feel heavy all day if I don't go
to the bathroom in the morning.

22:24.676 --> 22:25.552
Hye-jin!

22:26.553 --> 22:29.389
Seong-hyeon, did I wake you up?

22:29.473 --> 22:30.599
No, you didn't.

22:31.308 --> 22:34.102
I drank too much.
I don't really remember what happened.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.021
Me neither.

22:36.855 --> 22:39.608
By the way, can I have your number?

22:39.691 --> 22:41.485
-I forgot to ask yesterday.
-Sure.

22:46.239 --> 22:47.407
Here you go.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.868
-Still the same last four digits?
-You remember that?

22:49.951 --> 22:52.370
I do, for some reason.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.624
I have to go to work, so I'll get going.

22:55.707 --> 22:58.168
-Have a nice day. I'll call you.
-Okay.

22:59.127 --> 23:00.253
Where's Ms. Dentist?

23:00.337 --> 23:01.838
She left.

23:02.339 --> 23:03.632
-She did?
-Yes.

23:04.257 --> 23:05.425
I'll get going too.

23:06.468 --> 23:07.302
Hey.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.972
Do you want some <i>ramyeon</i>?

23:20.690 --> 23:21.691
Gosh, you startled me.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.610
Another night at Chief Hong's?

23:23.693 --> 23:27.197
Yes. But we just slept. Again.

23:27.781 --> 23:28.949
And we weren't alone.

23:29.032 --> 23:31.076
I see. Who else was there?

23:31.660 --> 23:33.328
Do you remember Seong-hyeon?

23:33.411 --> 23:35.330
Of course. Ji Seong-hyeon?

23:35.413 --> 23:38.416
Yes. He's in Gongjin now.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.043
He's shooting a show here.

23:40.127 --> 23:41.878
Unbelievable.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.631
Can I take a shower first?

23:45.132 --> 23:46.508
My head is splitting.

23:48.009 --> 23:50.512
Why is my whole body aching?

23:50.595 --> 23:55.100
Caught between a rock and a hard place,
Chief Hong and Ji Seong-hyeon.

23:55.183 --> 23:59.896
Will Yoon Hye-jin's simple life
finally get more complicated?

24:01.690 --> 24:02.899
-I can hear you.
-Gosh.

24:02.983 --> 24:05.110
This is really exciting.

24:06.111 --> 24:08.113
I made a lot. Eat as much as you want.

24:09.948 --> 24:13.326
Hold on. Did you put eggs in it?

24:13.410 --> 24:14.911
Yes, to add some protein.

24:14.995 --> 24:18.165
Come on. This is unacceptable.

24:18.248 --> 24:20.208
Eggs ruin the flavor of the soup.

24:20.292 --> 24:24.045
It's best to follow the instructions
on the back of the packet to a T.

24:24.129 --> 24:27.132
Come on. To each his own, isn't it?

24:27.215 --> 24:28.967
Why are you so strict?

24:29.050 --> 24:30.510
Forget it. Don't eat it then.

24:30.594 --> 24:33.096
-I'll eat it all.
-No. I'm sorry. I'll eat it.

24:36.474 --> 24:39.311
-You'll be our guide, right?
-The noodles are getting soggy.

24:39.394 --> 24:40.270
Eat up.

24:51.573 --> 24:52.782
I need more allowance.

24:52.866 --> 24:57.162
Times have changed. 20,000 won a week
is not even close to enough.

24:57.245 --> 25:02.125
You'll just spend all your allowance
on magazines that feature DOS anyway.

25:02.209 --> 25:04.628
You want me to run away from home again?

25:05.670 --> 25:08.089
Sure, do that. Leave right now!

25:08.173 --> 25:10.634
-What?
-Do you think I'll bat an eye?

25:11.134 --> 25:12.385
Hye-jin.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.971
-Hey.
-Hello.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.265
Will DOS really be on that variety show?

25:17.349 --> 25:19.100
-Will they?
-Dr. Yoon.

25:19.601 --> 25:21.770
-Is the director really--
-Can I order first?

25:23.688 --> 25:25.357
Ju-ri. Aren't you going to school?

25:25.982 --> 25:27.651
-What time is it?
-No!

25:28.151 --> 25:30.237
Hurry up and go to school!

25:30.320 --> 25:32.697
Did you pack everything? Go now.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.741
-Hye-jin, I'll call you.
-Okay.

25:34.824 --> 25:36.952
You'll get penalty points again!

25:37.827 --> 25:40.580
-Ms. Yoon, an iced Americano for you?
-Yes, please.

25:40.664 --> 25:41.748
Coming right up.

25:42.582 --> 25:43.583
Let's see here.

25:44.584 --> 25:45.919
SEONG-HYEON

25:46.002 --> 25:49.339
<i>Hye-jin, it was really nice
seeing you again.</i>

25:49.422 --> 25:52.217
<i>See you soon. I'll call you.</i>

25:53.677 --> 25:56.096
Ms. Yoon, are you listening to me?

25:56.179 --> 25:57.389
Oh, yes.

25:57.472 --> 25:59.140
Come on. No, you're not.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.438
I drank too much.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.490
What's this?

26:15.573 --> 26:16.825
Coffee-flavored candy.

26:16.908 --> 26:19.452
It really wakes you up in the morning.

26:21.579 --> 26:24.082
Do you have a whole supermarket
in your bag or what?

26:24.165 --> 26:25.458
Pretty much.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.212
It's good.

26:30.380 --> 26:33.174
Look at you two.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.302
I can tell you tortured
your livers all night.

26:35.385 --> 26:36.886
He did, but I didn't.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.805
Don't put me in the same boat as him.

26:38.888 --> 26:40.932
Aren't we though? Why do you have to--

26:41.016 --> 26:43.184
Sand lance sauce, <i>tangsuyuk</i>,
and what else?

26:43.268 --> 26:44.686
-Strawberry, seven.
-Exactly.

26:44.769 --> 26:46.521
Do you want to play some more games?

26:47.230 --> 26:49.733
-No, thanks.
-Have pity on him.

26:49.816 --> 26:52.777
Even his subconscious is
swamped in his work.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.279
I thought I'd die playing games.

26:54.362 --> 26:56.031
Good job. Keep it up.

27:01.578 --> 27:04.372
Did you sleep well?
Your eyes are all puffy.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.709
I'm glad I did. I'll be sleep-deprived
for the next few months.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.711
-Good thinking.
-Why do you look a mess?

27:09.794 --> 27:12.088
Well, let me introduce our guide to you.

27:12.172 --> 27:16.509
This is Chief Hong of Gongjin-dong.
He'll be our guide while we're here.

27:16.593 --> 27:18.136
Nice to meet you all.

27:18.219 --> 27:20.138
He'll be working closely with you.

27:20.221 --> 27:22.766
Hello, I'm Kim Do-ha,
the assistant director.

27:22.849 --> 27:24.559
I'll be in your care.

27:24.642 --> 27:25.935
Looking forward, buddy.

27:26.019 --> 27:27.687
"Buddy"? We only just met.

27:28.271 --> 27:31.941
Just get used to it. It's his style.

27:32.025 --> 27:33.568
It's more of a philosophy.

27:33.651 --> 27:35.320
Hand in hand. We are the world.

27:35.403 --> 27:37.697
We're all friends, aren't we?

27:37.781 --> 27:38.740
-We are.
-Let's go.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.827
What a cool guy. I like him.

27:42.911 --> 27:43.953
Let's go.

27:49.459 --> 27:50.710
-I know this place.
-Right?

27:50.794 --> 27:52.462
Ms. Wang, you've been here.

27:52.545 --> 27:53.838
I have.

27:53.922 --> 27:54.756
It's nice here.

27:54.839 --> 27:57.467
-There's a lake over there.
-Is it nice?

27:57.550 --> 28:00.220
That's a port. You can't surf there.

28:00.303 --> 28:01.846
-I can take a picture of you.
-No.

28:02.597 --> 28:04.224
That's not what I meant. I'm sorry.

28:04.307 --> 28:06.017
I meant for work.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.644
Did you two just meet?

28:08.144 --> 28:10.355
Snow crab season is almost over.

28:13.149 --> 28:17.070
So tell me.
Where will the main shoot location be?

28:17.153 --> 28:18.905
I have a place in mind.

28:21.449 --> 28:22.283
All right.

28:23.618 --> 28:27.247
No, you can't. You came here for nothing.

28:27.330 --> 28:30.708
I've lived in this house all my life.

28:30.792 --> 28:32.877
I can't give it up for you.

28:32.961 --> 28:35.797
Ma'am, we're not asking you
to give it up for us.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.383
We're just asking if we could borrow it.

28:38.466 --> 28:41.386
Three days, five times.
So fifteen days in total.

28:41.469 --> 28:46.266
Just leave. Whatever you say,
it's not going to work.

28:46.349 --> 28:48.977
-Grandma, you know--
-Shut it.

28:49.060 --> 28:52.772
I'm not going to fall
for whatever you say.

28:52.856 --> 28:56.317
You don't have to decide right now.
Give it some thought and--

28:56.401 --> 28:59.571
Even if you ask me a hundred times,
my answer will be the same.

28:59.654 --> 29:01.906
Beg me all you want,

29:01.990 --> 29:05.076
but my house is off-limits.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.547
Okay, I understand.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.550
If you're so strongly against the idea,

29:20.633 --> 29:23.011
I shouldn't try to force it upon you.

29:24.012 --> 29:26.723
I'm sorry for all the trouble, ma'am.

29:28.433 --> 29:29.726
See you again.

29:30.393 --> 29:31.227
All right.

29:31.853 --> 29:33.813
-Let's go.
-Okay.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.274
Grandma, take it easy.

29:46.868 --> 29:48.661
-Thank you.
-Don't thank me.

29:48.745 --> 29:50.038
Director Ji bought them.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.708
I didn't expect Ms. Gam-ri
to be so adamant.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.920
Hey, I've seen a few more houses.
Do you want to check them out?

29:57.003 --> 29:59.839
You mean Mr. Kim's house
with the red front door? I'll call.

29:59.923 --> 30:01.549
-Forget it.
-What?

30:01.633 --> 30:03.885
I won't film it unless it's that house.

30:08.973 --> 30:11.935
What are you talking about?
I thought you gave up.

30:12.644 --> 30:16.189
I didn't. I just said
I'd stop persuading or forcing her.

30:16.773 --> 30:19.609
Isn't that the same thing?
Then what's your plan?

30:20.735 --> 30:21.569
I'm hungry.

30:22.153 --> 30:24.447
All of a sudden? In this situation?

30:26.658 --> 30:29.035
Chief Hong, let's have lunch first.

30:29.118 --> 30:30.286
You're hungry too?

30:30.370 --> 30:32.163
Seong-hyeon has to eat right now.

30:32.247 --> 30:33.748
He can't stand being hungry.

30:33.832 --> 30:34.999
He just had breakfast.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.751
He had both <i>ramyeon</i> and rice.

30:36.835 --> 30:40.380
That's not enough.
His stomach is a bottomless pit.

30:42.590 --> 30:43.883
Unbelievable.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.386
You never cease to surprise me.

30:46.469 --> 30:48.179
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

30:48.805 --> 30:50.974
This is the third time I've been here.

30:51.057 --> 30:53.977
Are you involved with them in some way?

30:54.060 --> 30:57.313
I know you liked the food here.
Today I'm not going to cook.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.149
What can I get you?

31:00.233 --> 31:01.234
-Hello.
-Hello.

31:02.235 --> 31:04.195
-No. Let me surprise you.
-Sure.

31:06.739 --> 31:08.032
Here it comes.

31:09.576 --> 31:11.244
Enjoy.

31:11.327 --> 31:12.579
It looks fantastic.

31:12.662 --> 31:15.707
I told you you wouldn't be disappointed.

31:15.790 --> 31:18.001
I've never seen this before.
What fish is this?

31:18.084 --> 31:19.210
Fringed blenny.

31:19.919 --> 31:22.547
They're impossible to farm,
so they're always wild.

31:22.630 --> 31:26.175
I haven't had this in forever.

31:26.259 --> 31:28.845
You can have this at this price only here.

31:28.928 --> 31:31.347
-In Seoul, it's 100,000 won per kilo.
-That's right.

31:32.307 --> 31:33.683
-I can't wait.
-Thank you.

31:33.766 --> 31:35.768
-Enjoy.
-Dig in.

31:35.852 --> 31:36.728
Oh, my.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.105
Dip it in soy sauce.

31:39.188 --> 31:40.356
It's delicious.

31:41.357 --> 31:42.191
It's amazing.

31:55.204 --> 31:57.123
Sweet, chewy, soft.

31:57.206 --> 31:59.792
The flavors form
a perfectly-balanced triangle.

31:59.876 --> 32:02.670
It's as if the fish comes back alive and…

32:05.423 --> 32:06.549
swims in my mouth.

32:06.633 --> 32:09.802
On top of that,
the perfect texture and fresh flavors.

32:09.886 --> 32:10.887
You know what this is?

32:10.970 --> 32:12.972
-The Holy Trinity.
-The Holy Trinity.

32:17.101 --> 32:20.063
-Do-ha, observe them closely.
-Why?

32:20.146 --> 32:22.148
You don't want to end up like them.

32:22.231 --> 32:25.151
-It's so good.
-I'll kill you if you do.

32:25.818 --> 32:27.028
-Okay.
-Eat up.

32:27.111 --> 32:28.821
-Enjoy.
-Go ahead.

32:28.905 --> 32:30.323
Let's eat.

32:32.116 --> 32:33.493
They're so noisy.

32:39.874 --> 32:41.376
My stomach is about to burst.

32:41.459 --> 32:42.460
Me too.

32:43.419 --> 32:44.754
Same here.

32:44.837 --> 32:47.090
But one person is still going strong.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.342
-Unbelievable.
-No way.

32:49.425 --> 32:51.678
Hey, Ms. Dentist. Are you here for lunch?

32:52.261 --> 32:54.722
-My gosh. Hye-jin.
-Seong-hyeon.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.016
Oh, hello.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.185
I'm Hye-jin's friend, Pyo Mi-seon.

32:59.268 --> 33:01.688
We met once a long time ago.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.564
-When?
-A while back.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.900
I remember. Hello.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.110
Hello.

33:07.193 --> 33:09.612
Am I invisible? No one says hi to me.

33:09.696 --> 33:11.114
-Hi, Chief Hong.
-Hi.

33:11.197 --> 33:13.032
-Dr. Yoon's here?
-Hello.

33:13.116 --> 33:14.867
Do you want to sit with them?

33:14.951 --> 33:17.328
We're finished. Let's get going.

33:17.912 --> 33:19.539
-Pay with our company card.
-Okay.

33:19.622 --> 33:20.999
I'll go look at the menu.

33:21.082 --> 33:22.125
-Okay.
-Let's go.

33:23.584 --> 33:25.837
-It's hot out, isn't it?
-It is.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.881
We would've come later
if we'd known you were coming.

33:28.965 --> 33:31.551
It's nice to see you anyway.

33:31.634 --> 33:34.137
-Aren't you hung over?
-That's why I came here.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.848
-The <i>jiri</i> was really good. Have that.
-Let me decide.

33:36.931 --> 33:38.266
Order <i>jiri</i>.

33:38.349 --> 33:42.020
By the way, it looks like
he's decided to accept the job.

33:42.103 --> 33:44.689
-Yes.
-I'm devoting myself to Gongjin.

33:44.772 --> 33:46.065
As if.

33:46.774 --> 33:49.193
Has he told you about his fees yet?

33:50.028 --> 33:51.612
-Not yet.
-Oh, right.

33:51.696 --> 33:56.200
I'm glad you brought that up.
Will you explain to him about my fees?

33:56.284 --> 33:58.327
I'm not your spokesperson or anything.

33:58.411 --> 34:00.747
Explain it to him yourself.

34:00.830 --> 34:01.664
I'm all ears.

34:03.624 --> 34:08.337
You just have to pay him
the minimum wage. By the hour.

34:08.421 --> 34:11.924
The overtime rate is
1.5 times the regular wage.

34:12.008 --> 34:13.009
Good job.

34:13.092 --> 34:15.636
And other than that,
he doesn't accept any money.

34:16.345 --> 34:18.264
He's a bit of a weirdo.

34:18.347 --> 34:20.641
Why would you say that?

34:20.725 --> 34:22.060
He needs some days off too.

34:22.143 --> 34:25.229
And on his days off,
he refuses to do any work.

34:25.313 --> 34:28.107
So make sure you agree
on the schedule in advance.

34:28.191 --> 34:29.150
Is that right?

34:30.359 --> 34:33.571
But do you have to work with him?

34:33.654 --> 34:36.532
-What?
-Seong-hyeon, we should get going.

34:36.616 --> 34:38.785
-Bye.
-Get going then.

34:39.368 --> 34:42.747
-I'll treat you to something nice soon.
-Okay. I'll look forward to it.

34:44.207 --> 34:45.708
-See you.
-Bye.

34:46.334 --> 34:48.795
"I'll look forward to it."

34:48.878 --> 34:50.379
Is there a problem?

34:50.463 --> 34:52.381
I thought you didn't let anyone treat you.

34:52.465 --> 34:54.926
-Aren't you leaving?
-"I'll look forward to it."

34:55.510 --> 34:56.928
Were you trying to sound cute?

34:57.011 --> 34:58.346
-You're annoying.
-Enjoy.

34:58.429 --> 34:59.430
Go away.

34:59.514 --> 35:03.267
Man, the sky is amazing today!
The air is fresh too!

35:03.351 --> 35:05.311
You're in a good mood again.

35:05.394 --> 35:08.606
Your biorhythm sways on what you eat.

35:09.148 --> 35:12.068
Seong-hyeon, are you really not going
to check out other houses?

35:12.151 --> 35:14.195
Since we're full,
why don't we go shopping?

35:14.278 --> 35:15.446
What? Shopping?

35:15.530 --> 35:16.948
The market is that way, right?

35:17.031 --> 35:18.032
Shopping?

35:18.116 --> 35:21.619
Mr. Ji, you don't even know
where you're going!

35:21.702 --> 35:23.287
Don't tell him where it is.

35:23.371 --> 35:24.705
Well…

35:25.289 --> 35:27.458
I have a serious question for you.

35:27.542 --> 35:30.545
Why do you work with a guy like that?
You're a freelance writer.

35:30.628 --> 35:32.130
You must have a choice.

35:33.464 --> 35:36.509
I look up to Director Ji.

35:37.176 --> 35:39.303
What? You look up to him?

35:39.387 --> 35:40.221
Yes.

35:42.056 --> 35:45.184
-Resp…
-Gosh, that was cheesy.

35:45.268 --> 35:49.230
Respect? I see, none of you are normal.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.399
These must have come in today.

35:51.482 --> 35:53.067
-The onions?
-Yes.

35:54.277 --> 35:55.736
They have a lot over there.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.197
-Hello, I'll have a look around.
-Hello.

35:58.281 --> 36:00.491
-These look nice.
-Are these your style?

36:00.575 --> 36:01.617
-Come here.
-Why?

36:01.701 --> 36:03.619
-What are you doing?
-Stay still.

36:03.703 --> 36:04.912
Gosh.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.581
These look good.

36:06.664 --> 36:08.749
-These suit me better.
-I'll take these three.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.501
-Are they for me?
-Hold on.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.837
-You look good.
-Look at me.

36:12.920 --> 36:16.299
-We'll buy ten squid.
-Sure.

36:16.382 --> 36:17.508
Dried pufferfish…

36:17.592 --> 36:19.510
Why are you buying so much?

36:19.594 --> 36:20.469
These are small.

36:20.553 --> 36:23.514
-They're different sizes.
-They're used for different dishes?

36:24.265 --> 36:25.808
-I'll take both.
-What?

36:25.892 --> 36:27.393
Guys, let's try that!

36:29.312 --> 36:30.313
Go follow him.

36:30.396 --> 36:31.480
What did he find?

36:31.564 --> 36:33.733
What is it?

36:34.650 --> 36:35.902
Is he eating again?

36:35.985 --> 36:37.695
-Hello, sir.
-Welcome.

36:37.778 --> 36:40.031
-I'll take all of these.
-Sure.

36:40.114 --> 36:41.866
-Take this.
-Hey, take this.

36:41.949 --> 36:43.492
-Eat it!
-The whole thing?

36:43.576 --> 36:45.411
-Look at the legs.
-It'll be an insert.

36:45.494 --> 36:46.579
Here.

36:47.246 --> 36:48.998
Bite it off.

36:49.081 --> 36:50.833
There you go. Are you eating it?

36:50.917 --> 36:53.002
This candy… Hold on.

36:53.085 --> 36:54.545
-Come on.
-What's wrong?

36:54.629 --> 36:57.048
-Why are you buying so much?
-Please pack it for me.

36:57.131 --> 36:58.716
-This.
-I'll carry it.

36:58.799 --> 37:00.092
-Somebody stop him.
-This.

37:00.176 --> 37:02.929
-<i>Senbei</i>?
-I'll take these three.

37:03.012 --> 37:04.263
Do we have everything?

37:10.228 --> 37:11.229
Ms. Kim.

37:12.188 --> 37:15.399
Here. This is <i>gangnaengi</i>.

37:15.483 --> 37:19.362
This is <i>hangwa</i>.
Aren't the colors so beautiful?

37:20.488 --> 37:24.992
Look how shiny they are.
I'm sure they taste great.

37:25.076 --> 37:28.037
Do you think I'll fall for this?

37:28.120 --> 37:30.456
Put them away or I'll kick you out.

37:30.539 --> 37:34.377
Come on. Don't be like that.

37:34.460 --> 37:36.963
Stop bothering me.

37:37.463 --> 37:40.967
I made myself clear yesterday.

37:41.550 --> 37:43.010
I know.

37:43.094 --> 37:46.806
I'm just repaying you for the delicious
meal you made for me the other day.

37:46.889 --> 37:48.891
Stop lying.

37:49.558 --> 37:52.853
Do you think I don't know this is a bribe?

37:52.937 --> 37:55.064
No, it's really not.

37:55.147 --> 37:59.068
I'm not going to shoot anything here
because you said no.

38:00.027 --> 38:03.948
Ms. Kim, today I just came by to say hi.

38:04.615 --> 38:08.327
So please take these, okay?

38:09.078 --> 38:10.079
Gam-ri.

38:10.997 --> 38:15.793
You shouldn't ignore his kind gesture.
That's not right.

38:15.876 --> 38:17.295
She's right.

38:18.421 --> 38:20.256
Just this once then.

38:21.424 --> 38:24.593
I'm only taking these to save your face.

38:24.677 --> 38:28.055
Sure. Please enjoy. Help yourselves.

38:30.182 --> 38:32.226
-Here.
-Come on.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.062
Ms. Kim!

38:35.146 --> 38:36.772
-What?
-Put it down!

38:36.856 --> 38:38.733
-I'll carry it. Put it down.
-It's okay.

38:38.816 --> 38:40.693
I'll carry it for you.

38:40.776 --> 38:42.778
It's really fine.

38:42.862 --> 38:43.988
I was going to wash it.

38:44.071 --> 38:46.741
I'll wash it. Rest up.

38:48.492 --> 38:49.327
I'll wash it.

38:49.994 --> 38:51.454
It's very dirty.

38:52.288 --> 38:54.915
I saw it at the market
and thought it was so pretty.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.000
Oh, my.

38:56.083 --> 38:57.168
Try it on.

38:57.251 --> 38:58.502
No way.

38:58.586 --> 38:59.962
Don't be like that. Try it on.

39:00.046 --> 39:01.505
I have many hats.

39:01.589 --> 39:06.260
I'll leave it here,
so try it on later. Okay?

39:06.927 --> 39:07.928
Goodness.

39:15.269 --> 39:17.480
Let's see if it looks good on me.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.318
Oh, my.

39:28.532 --> 39:31.202
Like this… There you go.

39:31.285 --> 39:32.286
It's back on!

39:32.370 --> 39:34.497
-It's fixed.
-Good.

39:36.374 --> 39:39.126
Here. Drink this.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.753
-Thank you.
-Good job.

39:43.339 --> 39:45.299
You did a great job.

39:45.925 --> 39:47.718
There you go.

39:48.719 --> 39:50.304
It's very good.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.597
It won't go off now.

39:51.680 --> 39:53.891
Okay. Thank you.

40:21.043 --> 40:23.963
That young man's given up so easily.

40:32.680 --> 40:37.184
You saw Dr. Yoon and Director Ji
coming out of Chief Hong's place?

40:37.268 --> 40:39.353
How many times do I have to tell you?

40:39.437 --> 40:40.312
-Really?
-Yes.

40:40.396 --> 40:43.107
-Why?
-How should I know?

40:43.190 --> 40:47.319
Anyway, a love triangle seems to be
the new trend in Gongjin.

40:47.403 --> 40:49.113
A trend? Who else?

40:49.196 --> 40:50.114
I can't believe you.

40:50.739 --> 40:53.075
Yeo Hwa-jeong, Chang Yeong-guk,
and Yu Cho-hui.

40:53.159 --> 40:54.869
They're the ones who started it.

40:54.952 --> 40:57.496
Tell me more. I don't remember it well.

40:58.706 --> 40:59.957
You don't?

41:00.040 --> 41:01.500
Why would you look so happy?

41:01.584 --> 41:03.377
Then I'll have to tell you.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.629
It was 15 years ago.

41:05.713 --> 41:08.757
That's when Cho-hui was
first transferred to Gongjin.

41:09.508 --> 41:11.719
And she boarded at Hwa-jeong's house.

41:11.802 --> 41:13.512
BOARDING HOUSE

41:14.346 --> 41:15.764
You have so many books.

41:16.432 --> 41:17.892
Isn't that heavy?

41:17.975 --> 41:19.143
I'll put it here.

41:19.226 --> 41:22.897
Hwa-jeong, I brought some dried fish.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.023
Come…

41:40.456 --> 41:42.958
Hey! You dropped it.

41:44.502 --> 41:47.630
<i>You all know what Hwa-jeong was like.</i>

41:47.713 --> 41:49.507
<i>-She was a tomboy.
</i>-You want to die?

41:49.590 --> 41:50.633
<i>You're right.</i>

41:50.716 --> 41:52.760
<i>And what was Cho-hui like?</i>

41:52.843 --> 41:55.930
<i>She was delicate like a wild flower
swaying in the wind.</i>

41:56.013 --> 41:57.473
<i>Imagine how Yeong-guk felt.</i>

41:57.556 --> 41:59.934
<i>He fell in love at first sight.</i>

42:00.017 --> 42:02.353
<i>Soon the three of them
started hanging out together.</i>

42:02.436 --> 42:03.979
<i>Only they didn't seem to know</i>

42:04.480 --> 42:07.608
<i>that they were trapped
in the Bermuda Love Triangle.</i>

42:07.691 --> 42:09.401
<i>-Bermuda?
-Yes.</i>

42:09.485 --> 42:12.071
<i>And? What happened next?</i>

42:12.154 --> 42:12.988
BOARDING HOUSE

42:13.072 --> 42:15.741
-Cho-hui, take care.
-You too.

42:15.824 --> 42:17.743
-Call me when you arrive.
-Go back inside.

42:17.826 --> 42:18.869
Bye.

42:18.953 --> 42:19.787
See you.

42:20.829 --> 42:21.830
Goodbye.

42:23.666 --> 42:27.378
<i>And then one of Cho-hui's parents
became unwell.</i>

42:27.461 --> 42:29.171
<i>-Right.
-It was her mother.</i>

42:29.255 --> 42:30.714
<i>Her mother fell ill.</i>

42:30.798 --> 42:33.676
<i>After just a year, Cho-hui
moved back home, and that was it.</i>

42:34.510 --> 42:37.429
<i>That's it? It's nothing.</i>

42:37.513 --> 42:38.597
<i>Exactly. It's nothing.</i>

42:39.598 --> 42:43.269
Well, I guess it wasn't anything special.

42:43.978 --> 42:47.147
But you should know this.
Guys never forget their first love.

42:49.733 --> 42:52.778
-Is that the case for you too?
-Me?

42:54.071 --> 42:56.490
I don't even remember
who my first love was.

42:57.908 --> 43:00.578
-You're lying.
-No, I'm not.

43:00.661 --> 43:04.164
You're wrong.
First love is no big deal to men.

43:04.248 --> 43:06.083
Since we were so inexperienced.

43:06.166 --> 43:07.835
-Exactly.
-Inexperienced in what?

43:07.918 --> 43:09.336
I mean, it's incomplete.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.130
How does it become complete then?

43:11.213 --> 43:14.425
You're unbelievable.
When it's incomplete, how is it?

43:14.508 --> 43:16.260
-I don't know.
-It's more meaningful.

43:18.679 --> 43:20.306
Hello.

43:21.098 --> 43:22.850
Hello.

43:22.933 --> 43:24.893
-Hello.
-We were cleaning the fish.

43:24.977 --> 43:26.854
-I see.
-Do you want to try some?

43:26.937 --> 43:29.231
-Sorry?
-What can I get you?

43:29.315 --> 43:30.524
A cup of coffee, please.

43:30.608 --> 43:33.527
Coming right up.
Guys, clean the fish somewhere else.

43:39.658 --> 43:44.330
I-jun, stop reading and play with me.
How about wrestling?

43:44.413 --> 43:45.664
Or should we play catch?

43:46.707 --> 43:48.751
Have you forgotten you broke a vase

43:48.834 --> 43:50.628
and Mom kicked you out last time?

43:50.711 --> 43:52.671
Right. I remember now.

43:54.715 --> 43:56.967
Next time, come to my place.

43:57.051 --> 43:59.428
There's nothing to break there.
You can play catch.

44:01.430 --> 44:02.848
But your place smells bad.

44:02.931 --> 44:04.183
Really?

44:04.892 --> 44:08.646
Do I smell bad too?

44:09.647 --> 44:13.317
No, you don't. But your place does.

44:14.276 --> 44:15.194
Dad.

44:15.694 --> 44:20.616
Wash your clothes and feet often,
and don't forget to air out the house.

44:21.241 --> 44:22.201
Okay?

44:24.953 --> 44:25.996
Okay.

44:26.080 --> 44:27.706
My boy is all grown up.

44:32.878 --> 44:34.922
I have to use the bathroom.

44:35.005 --> 44:38.801
Okay. It must be all the water you drank.

44:49.061 --> 44:52.731
I think I saw it somewhere around here
some time ago.

44:53.732 --> 44:55.901
Where could it be?

44:55.984 --> 44:57.486
Let's see here.

45:08.122 --> 45:09.623
I found it.

45:11.333 --> 45:12.751
That's mine.

45:14.795 --> 45:16.964
You said you'd be home late.

45:17.047 --> 45:19.967
Why would you go through my drawer?
Put that down.

45:20.050 --> 45:22.219
I was just wondering…

45:22.302 --> 45:25.055
You know, just in case.
It looks exactly the same.

45:25.139 --> 45:27.933
Are you sure it's yours?

45:28.016 --> 45:30.644
Nothing in this house belongs to you.

45:30.727 --> 45:32.980
Is that right? Then I'm sorry.

45:43.031 --> 45:44.658
Why aren't you coming out?

45:46.952 --> 45:50.164
I have something to tell you.

45:52.332 --> 45:55.919
I'm thinking of having a meal
with Cho-hui. Alone.

45:56.920 --> 45:58.672
Is that okay?

46:00.466 --> 46:03.635
-Are you out of your mind?
-Sorry, I thought I saw a mosquito.

46:03.719 --> 46:05.429
-Hey!
-A fruit fly, maybe?

46:08.390 --> 46:09.558
Hey!

46:09.641 --> 46:10.642
I caught it.

46:14.062 --> 46:14.897
What?

46:15.647 --> 46:17.483
There really was one?

46:18.275 --> 46:19.735
I want to join you two.

46:19.818 --> 46:20.903
What?

46:20.986 --> 46:24.156
The other day, Cho-hui said
we should all have a meal together.

46:25.532 --> 46:26.450
That's…

46:26.533 --> 46:30.078
Let's meet at Mozart tomorrow.

46:32.539 --> 46:34.208
Sure, let's do that.

46:34.958 --> 46:36.460
Gosh, that stings.

47:06.782 --> 47:09.326
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Min-ju, is that you?

47:09.409 --> 47:10.410
<i>Grandma?</i>

47:10.994 --> 47:15.123
Yes, it's me.
I'm glad you answered my call.

47:15.207 --> 47:17.960
What time is it there in America?

47:18.043 --> 47:20.712
<i>Here? It's 6 a.m.</i>

47:20.796 --> 47:24.258
Oh, no.
You must be so busy with your studies.

47:24.341 --> 47:29.596
I'm so sorry I woke you up.

47:29.680 --> 47:32.808
<i>It's fine. Anyway, why did you call me?</i>

47:32.891 --> 47:38.814
I just missed you. That's why I called.

47:39.690 --> 47:43.694
Your vacation starts soon.
Are you coming to Korea?

47:44.236 --> 47:46.530
If you come to Gongjin,

47:46.613 --> 47:52.119
I'll cook you any dish you want.

47:53.203 --> 47:57.457
<i>I'm going to California
for vacation with my friends.</i>

47:57.541 --> 47:59.459
<i>But I'll try to visit you.</i>

47:59.543 --> 48:03.922
I see. Don't worry about me.

48:04.006 --> 48:06.049
Do whatever suits you best.

48:07.050 --> 48:10.012
Eat well and take care of yourself.

48:10.554 --> 48:13.307
Okay. Bye.

48:28.280 --> 48:29.948
Oh, that?

48:30.032 --> 48:33.535
The implant will be angled
to fit inside the bone.

48:33.619 --> 48:36.121
In that case,
an SCRP might reveal the hole.

48:36.204 --> 48:38.123
That's why I asked for the cement type.

48:41.168 --> 48:42.085
Yes.

48:42.878 --> 48:43.879
Okay.

48:56.016 --> 48:57.893
BORA SUPERMARKET

48:58.852 --> 49:00.312
Someone won 1.4 billion won?

49:02.356 --> 49:04.733
-Hello.
-Hi, Mi-seon.

49:05.776 --> 49:07.527
-I'll take these.
-Sure.

49:08.028 --> 49:09.321
One, two, three, four.

49:10.489 --> 49:12.115
-Yun-gyeong.
-Yes?

49:12.199 --> 49:15.535
Is it true? The third mystery of Gongjin?

49:15.619 --> 49:21.458
Yes. Three years ago,
someone in Gongjin won the lottery.

49:21.541 --> 49:24.002
The prize was
no less than 1.4 billion won.

49:24.503 --> 49:26.296
That's incredible.

49:26.380 --> 49:30.592
But how do you know
it was someone living in Gongjin?

49:30.676 --> 49:34.554
A typhoon swept through
the entire city that week.

49:34.638 --> 49:36.765
All the roads were blocked,

49:36.848 --> 49:39.142
and some parts were completely flooded.

49:39.226 --> 49:40.852
No outsiders could enter Gongjin.

49:40.936 --> 49:45.399
I remember it clearly.
We were open for only two days that week.

49:45.482 --> 49:50.612
I see. But don't you remember
who you sold the ticket to?

49:50.696 --> 49:52.030
The thing is,

49:52.864 --> 49:56.118
most neighbors bought
lottery tickets around that time.

49:56.201 --> 49:59.371
Since the situation was so grave,
they wanted some kind of hope.

49:59.454 --> 50:02.958
All we know is
one of Gongjin residents won the lottery.

50:03.041 --> 50:05.085
But no one's life seems
to have gotten rich.

50:05.669 --> 50:06.920
I'm dying to know myself.

50:12.592 --> 50:15.345
Two five-thousand-won
lottery tickets, please.

50:17.472 --> 50:18.306
Officer Choi.

50:18.974 --> 50:20.851
Ms. Pyo. Did you just get off work?

50:20.934 --> 50:23.103
Yes. What about you?

50:23.186 --> 50:25.147
I'm still on duty. Get home safe.

50:25.230 --> 50:28.483
Hold on. Take this.

50:28.567 --> 50:30.902
I bought two. I'm giving you one.

50:30.986 --> 50:33.113
What? No, I'm fine.

50:33.196 --> 50:36.908
You can have it. Treat me if you win.

50:36.992 --> 50:38.827
No. I'm really fine.

50:40.996 --> 50:43.457
-Can't you just take it?
-What?

50:43.540 --> 50:45.751
It's not like this is a bribe.

50:45.834 --> 50:49.880
It's just a 5,000-won gift.
Why do you have to turn it down so coldly?

50:51.423 --> 50:53.008
Throw it away if you want.

50:54.593 --> 50:55.594
Wait…

51:08.064 --> 51:11.067
-What are you up to?
-Can't you see? I'm washing the blankets.

51:11.151 --> 51:13.570
-Oh, my.
-Hello.

51:13.653 --> 51:16.281
What brings you here?

51:16.364 --> 51:18.533
You forgot your wallet at the clinic.

51:18.617 --> 51:23.413
My goodness. What was I thinking?

51:23.497 --> 51:26.291
Thank you so much
for coming all the way here.

51:26.374 --> 51:28.376
Don't worry. I'll be going then.

51:28.460 --> 51:29.294
Okay.

51:30.754 --> 51:31.922
What's with you?

51:36.218 --> 51:37.552
-What's wrong?
-Grandma!

51:37.636 --> 51:39.429
Ms. Dentist wants to help out.

51:39.513 --> 51:43.391
Oh, my. That would be so great.

51:43.475 --> 51:48.063
Dr. Yoon, you're such a kind young lady.

51:48.563 --> 51:49.773
It's nothing.

51:50.357 --> 51:52.692
What are you waiting for? Go change.

51:55.946 --> 51:58.031
Do you have any clothes she can borrow?

52:07.749 --> 52:10.293
What do you think? Are they comfy?

52:10.377 --> 52:14.005
They're nice and airy.
They're the best work clothes.

52:14.089 --> 52:16.174
So? Do they fit you?

52:16.258 --> 52:17.300
Yes, they do.

52:17.384 --> 52:20.095
What are you doing?
Come here and get to work.

52:21.596 --> 52:23.014
What am I supposed to do?

52:23.098 --> 52:25.225
Just get in here and start stomping.

52:25.308 --> 52:28.061
You're as heavy as a sack of rice.
Put it to use.

52:28.937 --> 52:30.564
I'm not that heavy.

52:35.694 --> 52:40.031
By the way, why do you wash them this way
and not use a washing machine?

52:40.115 --> 52:43.034
Blankets are meant to be washed this way.

52:43.660 --> 52:45.287
It also relieves stress.

52:45.370 --> 52:48.874
If it's that good, you can do it alone.
Why drag me into it?

52:48.957 --> 52:50.750
It's too good to enjoy it alone.

52:50.834 --> 52:53.336
-I should share it with my friend.
-As if.

52:54.629 --> 52:59.009
I thought you'd throw a fit.
But you're pretty calm today.

52:59.092 --> 53:02.012
Have you decided to be friends with me?

53:02.095 --> 53:03.388
Whatever.

53:05.056 --> 53:06.558
You're making the water dirty.

53:06.641 --> 53:08.935
No. You're the one making it dirty.

53:09.019 --> 53:12.147
That's ridiculous.
The ground is tilted and everything.

53:12.230 --> 53:14.858
Yes, that's why the dirt flows
toward me from you.

53:14.941 --> 53:17.444
When did you last wash your feet?
Gosh, Chief Hong.

53:17.527 --> 53:19.487
The fact that you imagine that--

53:19.571 --> 53:21.364
Be quiet and stomp harder.

53:21.448 --> 53:22.616
Hey, that hurts.

53:45.430 --> 53:46.473
What are you doing?

53:46.556 --> 53:50.769
Wait a second.
I just remembered something weird.

53:50.852 --> 53:53.438
Don't you think this situation
could look weirder?

53:54.272 --> 53:55.231
-Sorry.
-Gosh.

53:56.107 --> 53:57.317
Are you a rhino or what?

53:57.400 --> 53:59.569
I thought I was being rammed by a mammoth.

53:59.653 --> 54:00.695
What?

54:00.779 --> 54:04.324
Please keep in mind
that your body can be a deadly weapon.

54:04.407 --> 54:07.285
Watch it. Be careful what you say.

54:07.369 --> 54:08.203
I will.

54:08.286 --> 54:10.997
Keep in mind that your body can--

54:11.581 --> 54:12.499
Stop it.

54:12.582 --> 54:13.583
It's a weapon.

54:17.587 --> 54:20.173
-Are you dancing?
-This is what you're supposed to do.

54:20.256 --> 54:22.926
-Stop splashing me.
-Watch and learn.

54:23.009 --> 54:26.888
It's more fun this way. Stomp harder.

54:40.193 --> 54:42.237
Love and passion to you.

54:42.821 --> 54:46.574
<i>I love you…</i>

54:56.251 --> 54:58.044
ZONE CHIEF YEO

55:02.090 --> 55:03.591
He's not picking up?

55:03.675 --> 55:07.220
No. He never shows up on time.

55:07.303 --> 55:08.638
It drives me crazy.

55:08.722 --> 55:10.974
I hope nothing bad happened.

55:11.057 --> 55:13.143
I don't think so. I'm sure he'll come.

55:13.226 --> 55:14.060
Okay.

55:14.811 --> 55:16.604
Let's look at the menu.

55:19.607 --> 55:23.236
"Seafood tomato pasta,
chicken cream risotto,

55:23.319 --> 55:26.197
lasagne, carbonara, vongole,

55:26.281 --> 55:27.866
aglio e olio"?

55:49.012 --> 55:50.680
Are you okay?

55:50.764 --> 55:52.682
I didn't mean to step on your foot. Sorry.

55:53.308 --> 55:54.726
<i>Sorbang, sorbang</i>

55:54.809 --> 55:55.935
What's that?

55:56.019 --> 55:57.520
Sorry, sorry, bang, bang.

55:58.021 --> 56:01.024
-You're so behind the times?
-Be careful.

56:14.829 --> 56:16.664
Keep twisting it. Keep going.

56:28.134 --> 56:29.552
This goes here. Stretch it.

56:29.636 --> 56:31.304
-Pull that side.
-Okay.

56:46.194 --> 56:49.906
They've been damp all summer.

56:49.989 --> 56:53.076
Take these too.

56:53.159 --> 56:56.579
Well, but… All of them?

56:56.663 --> 56:58.373
-Wash these too.
-I'm going home.

56:58.456 --> 57:00.792
Okay. Hold on.

57:09.384 --> 57:10.510
What's that?

57:10.593 --> 57:12.720
Good work.

57:12.804 --> 57:14.389
Have a little snack first.

57:14.472 --> 57:17.100
-Thanks, Ms. Gam-ri.
-Thank you. It looks tasty.

57:21.855 --> 57:24.065
-It's so good.
-It is?

57:24.149 --> 57:26.025
Labor is a good thing.

57:26.109 --> 57:28.445
It makes a person nice and simple.

57:28.528 --> 57:29.612
Right?

57:30.238 --> 57:31.072
Hye-jin.

57:32.157 --> 57:34.617
-Seong-hyeon!
-Chief Hong is here too?

57:34.701 --> 57:35.952
You want some corn?

57:36.035 --> 57:39.038
No, thanks.
Hye-jin, what are you doing here?

57:39.664 --> 57:44.002
Well, Ms. Kim is a patient at my clinic.

57:44.085 --> 57:47.422
So I was helping her with her laundry.
I look ridiculous, don't I?

57:48.965 --> 57:50.884
-Hey, look at you.
-Hi.

57:50.967 --> 57:53.470
I haven't seen you in a few days.

57:53.553 --> 57:56.139
Wait. Did you miss me?

57:56.222 --> 57:57.474
I didn't say that.

57:59.058 --> 58:00.143
What's going on here?

58:00.727 --> 58:04.314
Why are you being all coy with him?
When did you get so close?

58:04.397 --> 58:06.649
We're not close. Don't be silly.

58:07.734 --> 58:10.904
Ms. Kim, I brought a cake.

58:10.987 --> 58:13.406
It's from a super famous bakery.

58:13.490 --> 58:14.407
Here.

58:14.491 --> 58:18.453
Why do you keep bringing these things?

58:18.536 --> 58:20.747
Did you have dinner?

58:21.331 --> 58:24.375
No. I'm on my way to dinner with a friend.

58:25.585 --> 58:28.463
Should I tell him to come in and say hi?

58:28.546 --> 58:30.840
-Sure.
-All right.

58:30.924 --> 58:32.217
JUNE, come in!

58:37.180 --> 58:38.097
Hello.

58:47.524 --> 58:49.651
Who's that young man?

58:49.734 --> 58:53.780
Do you remember the band
from the Lighthouse Song Festival?

58:53.863 --> 58:55.823
JUNE is a member of that band.

58:55.907 --> 58:57.283
I see.

58:57.909 --> 59:02.705
Goodness, you're skinny as a needle.

59:02.789 --> 59:04.582
That's no good.

59:04.666 --> 59:09.003
I know. It's because he's been
only eating salads lately to lose weight.

59:09.087 --> 59:12.840
You can't live on just salad.

59:12.924 --> 59:14.425
Have dinner with us.

59:14.509 --> 59:15.885
Can we do that?

59:15.969 --> 59:18.721
You must be tired
after coming here from Seoul.

59:18.805 --> 59:20.890
Take it easy while I prepare dinner.

59:21.558 --> 59:24.018
Goodness. What should I make?

59:24.102 --> 59:25.186
Thank you.

59:26.396 --> 59:28.648
-What?
-You said we were having something nice.

59:28.731 --> 59:30.525
Hey, you'll be amazed.

59:30.608 --> 59:32.610
You can't find anything like it in Seoul.

59:32.694 --> 59:35.822
-This was your plan all along, wasn't it?
-Come on, Chief Hong.

59:36.823 --> 59:39.492
Guys, you know who JUNE is, right?

59:39.576 --> 59:40.743
<i>Please come back</i>

59:40.827 --> 59:42.787
<i>-Just a feeling
</i>-You're good.

59:42.870 --> 59:45.790
I've seen so many pictures of you,
I feel like I know you.

59:45.873 --> 59:47.375
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

59:48.543 --> 59:50.753
Do you remember me?

59:50.837 --> 59:52.130
-Yes.
-What?

59:52.213 --> 59:54.716
You're the dentist who treated me, right?

59:54.799 --> 59:57.552
Yes, that's me. It's been a while.

59:57.635 --> 59:59.679
-What a small world.
-I know.

59:59.762 --> 1:00:01.139
You two know each other?

1:00:01.723 --> 1:00:03.349
What a tiny world.

1:00:04.183 --> 1:00:06.185
I've never seen her light up like that.

1:00:08.938 --> 1:00:12.317
<i>Hye-jin. Is it true
that DOS will be shooting here?</i>

1:00:12.400 --> 1:00:14.193
<i>Is JUNE really coming here? Is he?</i>

1:00:17.572 --> 1:00:19.699
By the way, JUNE…

1:00:20.325 --> 1:00:21.200
Yes?

1:00:23.578 --> 1:00:24.829
Oh, my gosh.

1:00:25.496 --> 1:00:27.415
-Dad!
-Gosh, you startled me.

1:00:27.498 --> 1:00:29.334
You ruined my heart.

1:00:29.417 --> 1:00:32.587
Dad, pinch me. Right now.

1:00:32.670 --> 1:00:34.380
-You want me to pinch you?
-Yes.

1:00:34.464 --> 1:00:35.423
Okay.

1:00:38.676 --> 1:00:41.262
I'm not dreaming? This is real.

1:00:41.346 --> 1:00:44.015
This is real! What should I do?

1:00:44.098 --> 1:00:50.104
God, what's with her?
I feel like I don't know her anymore.

1:00:52.732 --> 1:00:54.734
It's not much, but help yourselves.

1:00:54.817 --> 1:00:56.611
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

1:00:56.694 --> 1:00:57.737
Ms. Kim, have a seat.

1:00:57.820 --> 1:00:59.614
Yes, eat with us.

1:00:59.697 --> 1:01:01.157
Okay. Gosh.

1:01:01.240 --> 1:01:03.576
-You must be hungry. Dig in.
-Okay.

1:01:11.167 --> 1:01:13.002
-This is fantastic.
-What?

1:01:13.086 --> 1:01:15.588
It's the best <i>doenjang jjigae</i>
I've ever tried.

1:01:16.589 --> 1:01:20.385
It's made with soybean paste
I made from scratch.

1:01:20.468 --> 1:01:21.844
It tastes incredible.

1:01:23.471 --> 1:01:26.015
I haven't had
a home-cooked meal in a while.

1:01:26.516 --> 1:01:30.103
It's nothing like the delivery food
you have in Seoul, right?

1:01:30.186 --> 1:01:32.188
-I totally agree.
-That's right.

1:01:32.271 --> 1:01:34.816
You must be too busy to have proper meals.

1:01:34.899 --> 1:01:40.613
Right. Ms. Kim,
this guy has been working nonstop

1:01:40.697 --> 1:01:42.448
since he was very young.

1:01:42.532 --> 1:01:46.077
You're still so young,
and you work so much?

1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:48.830
Try this.

1:01:50.081 --> 1:01:51.082
Here.

1:01:52.667 --> 1:01:54.168
-Try it.
-Thank you.

1:01:54.252 --> 1:01:55.503
What about me?

1:01:55.586 --> 1:01:57.088
You're a grown-up.

1:01:57.171 --> 1:01:59.465
Eat on your own.

1:02:00.091 --> 1:02:02.552
Fine. Here you go.

1:02:05.430 --> 1:02:07.932
I make it look tastier, don't I?

1:02:09.183 --> 1:02:12.937
See? It tastes even better
when you give it to me.

1:02:14.188 --> 1:02:16.357
Try some pollack too.

1:02:16.441 --> 1:02:19.986
-It's been simmered in sauce.
-Okay.

1:02:20.069 --> 1:02:21.779
-Eat up.
-Hye-jin, is JUNE really--

1:02:21.863 --> 1:02:22.697
What?

1:02:26.242 --> 1:02:28.202
How does it feel to see him in person?

1:02:28.703 --> 1:02:32.206
All the walls in her room are covered
with pictures of you.

1:02:32.290 --> 1:02:35.960
Is she the fan you told me about earlier?

1:02:36.043 --> 1:02:37.545
-Yes.
-You know her?

1:02:37.628 --> 1:02:39.464
-I know her very well.
-What?

1:02:39.547 --> 1:02:42.175
You're Oh Ju-ri, 14 years old, right?

1:02:42.258 --> 1:02:44.218
Yes, that's… right.

1:02:45.011 --> 1:02:47.597
Did you eat something?

1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:49.098
-Why the hiccups?
-It's just…

1:02:49.182 --> 1:02:50.099
-Are you okay?
-What?

1:02:50.183 --> 1:02:51.893
-Drink some water.
-Thank you.

1:02:55.021 --> 1:02:56.939
-Oh, my.
-Ju-ri, what's with you?

1:02:57.023 --> 1:03:00.151
You're not helping her hiccups go away.

1:03:00.234 --> 1:03:02.069
Drink slowly.

1:03:02.570 --> 1:03:03.821
-Drink this.
-Hey!

1:03:05.198 --> 1:03:07.784
-Did it stop?
-No, it didn't.

1:03:08.367 --> 1:03:10.077
My goodness.

1:03:10.161 --> 1:03:11.245
She's so cute.

1:03:11.329 --> 1:03:12.872
Ju-ri, are you okay?

1:03:17.502 --> 1:03:18.503
Goodness.

1:03:19.712 --> 1:03:21.964
I didn't realize how late it was.

1:03:22.590 --> 1:03:24.759
Cho-hui must've been waiting long.

1:03:26.427 --> 1:03:27.678
What?

1:03:28.387 --> 1:03:30.306
A thief in this situation?

1:03:30.389 --> 1:03:31.766
-He must be asleep.
-Gosh.

1:03:33.142 --> 1:03:34.560
Darn, my eyes.

1:03:35.186 --> 1:03:37.939
Are you nuts? Why are you lying there for?

1:03:38.022 --> 1:03:39.732
It's a long story.

1:03:39.816 --> 1:03:42.276
Anyway, where's Cho-hui?

1:03:42.360 --> 1:03:43.528
Yeong-guk.

1:03:44.946 --> 1:03:46.197
Cho-hui.

1:03:46.906 --> 1:03:51.369
I sprained my back and can't move.

1:03:53.329 --> 1:03:55.873
What? Stay away.

1:03:57.667 --> 1:03:59.168
Stay away.

1:03:59.252 --> 1:04:00.211
Much better.

1:04:02.171 --> 1:04:04.215
-Cho-hui, will you help me?
-Okay.

1:04:04.298 --> 1:04:05.341
Don't come closer!

1:04:05.424 --> 1:04:07.969
I'm fine. I'd rather be found as a mummy.

1:04:08.052 --> 1:04:11.806
-I'll grab his arms. You grab his legs.
-Okay. Are you okay?

1:04:11.889 --> 1:04:14.433
I'm fine. Please stay away.

1:04:14.517 --> 1:04:16.477
-Lift him on three. One, two,
-Okay.

1:04:16.561 --> 1:04:18.271
-three!
-Just don't!

1:04:20.398 --> 1:04:23.401
Well? Should I dress you?
Should I take you to the hospital?

1:04:24.318 --> 1:04:27.488
Forget it. I can take care of myself.
You can leave.

1:04:28.656 --> 1:04:31.409
Cho-hui, I'm sorry
that you had to see me like this.

1:04:31.492 --> 1:04:32.577
Don't worry.

1:04:33.160 --> 1:04:35.079
Should I go get some pain-relief patches?

1:04:35.162 --> 1:04:37.456
No, I'm fine. Oh, right.

1:04:37.540 --> 1:04:40.418
You'll find a first-aid kit
in one of the TV stand drawers.

1:04:40.501 --> 1:04:41.919
I'll go look for it.

1:04:46.007 --> 1:04:49.385
Hwa-jeong, will you pass me
that hairspray?

1:04:50.386 --> 1:04:51.762
What do you need it for?

1:04:54.432 --> 1:04:57.393
Gosh! Stop spraying me!

1:04:58.394 --> 1:05:00.813
I-jun said my place smells weird.

1:05:00.897 --> 1:05:03.232
-And Cho-hui's here now.
-Unbelievable.

1:05:03.316 --> 1:05:05.651
Can't you try to be nice?

1:05:05.735 --> 1:05:08.195
Yeong-guk, there's no pain-relief patch,

1:05:08.279 --> 1:05:10.448
but I found a muscle relaxant. Take this.

1:05:10.531 --> 1:05:12.658
Cho-hui, will you get me up?

1:05:14.368 --> 1:05:15.620
Easy now.

1:05:16.203 --> 1:05:18.372
There you go. Oh, my.

1:05:27.673 --> 1:05:29.592
I-jun takes after you.

1:05:31.218 --> 1:05:35.056
That's news to me.
I think he looks just like Yeong-guk.

1:05:35.640 --> 1:05:36.849
I mean his personality.

1:05:38.017 --> 1:05:42.104
He's smart and thoughtful.
He helps out his friends a lot.

1:05:42.688 --> 1:05:45.816
Just like you helped me out
back in the day.

1:05:47.568 --> 1:05:49.654
That was a long time ago.

1:05:51.364 --> 1:05:53.282
But I still remember it clearly.

1:05:54.951 --> 1:05:57.703
Those were the happiest days in my life.

1:06:01.165 --> 1:06:02.208
I…

1:06:03.459 --> 1:06:07.505
want us to go back
to the way we used to be.

1:06:08.130 --> 1:06:09.131
What?

1:06:09.757 --> 1:06:12.343
The three of us, hanging out together.

1:06:19.266 --> 1:06:20.977
-I'm so full.
-Are you okay now?

1:06:21.060 --> 1:06:23.020
What? Well, yes.

1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:27.775
Hey, are you really the Ju-ri I know?

1:06:27.858 --> 1:06:31.779
I don't know what you're talking about.
What did I do?

1:06:31.862 --> 1:06:34.740
You're scaring me.
Stop speaking so politely.

1:06:36.951 --> 1:06:40.705
Ms. Kim, thank you for the food.
I really enjoyed it.

1:06:40.788 --> 1:06:43.624
I'm glad to hear that.

1:06:44.375 --> 1:06:46.961
But you're too skinny.

1:06:47.044 --> 1:06:50.047
-You need to put on some weight.
-I will.

1:06:50.131 --> 1:06:52.758
Ms. Gam-ri, start a restaurant.
It's not too late.

1:06:52.842 --> 1:06:57.304
If you keep being silly,
I'll kick you out.

1:06:57.388 --> 1:06:59.265
All right, guys.

1:06:59.849 --> 1:07:02.518
I'll do the dishes
in return for the delicious food.

1:07:02.601 --> 1:07:04.270
I'll help you, Seong-hyeon.

1:07:04.353 --> 1:07:07.648
No, you have back problems.
And you washed blankets today.

1:07:07.732 --> 1:07:09.775
-It's okay.
-She has back problems?

1:07:09.859 --> 1:07:12.737
Yes. She got a herniated disc
after a car accident.

1:07:12.820 --> 1:07:14.405
Back in high school, right?

1:07:14.488 --> 1:07:17.616
You remember everything.
How is that possible?

1:07:17.700 --> 1:07:19.160
Of course.

1:07:19.243 --> 1:07:22.872
You guys can take it easy.
Leave everything to me.

1:07:22.955 --> 1:07:24.832
-No.
-I'll help you.

1:07:24.915 --> 1:07:26.584
Well, if you insist.

1:07:26.667 --> 1:07:29.086
-Gosh.
-Come on.

1:07:29.170 --> 1:07:35.176
You're practically washing
all the dishes I have.

1:07:35.259 --> 1:07:40.222
There are so many to wash. I feel bad.

1:07:40.306 --> 1:07:44.268
Don't worry. It won't take long.
I'm very good at this.

1:07:44.351 --> 1:07:46.145
That's a relief.

1:07:46.896 --> 1:07:48.856
I even brought a friend along today.

1:07:49.440 --> 1:07:52.276
Thank you for the delicious food again.

1:07:52.359 --> 1:07:57.281
Don't mention it.
It's just the food I eat every day.

1:07:57.865 --> 1:07:59.700
I thought it was quite a feast.

1:07:59.784 --> 1:08:00.701
What?

1:08:02.161 --> 1:08:06.165
I can't remember the last time

1:08:06.248 --> 1:08:08.709
I had to take out so many spoons.

1:08:08.793 --> 1:08:13.172
I'm sure the spoons were happy
to be used for the first time in a while.

1:08:14.632 --> 1:08:16.175
I had a great time, Ms. Kim.

1:08:16.759 --> 1:08:17.635
What?

1:08:18.344 --> 1:08:21.180
I enjoy hanging out with people

1:08:21.722 --> 1:08:24.892
more than anything else.

1:08:25.935 --> 1:08:29.188
Eating, laughing, and talking together.

1:08:30.397 --> 1:08:32.316
That's all there's to life, isn't it?

1:08:34.443 --> 1:08:35.444
I guess so.

1:08:53.504 --> 1:08:54.797
Good morning.

1:08:54.880 --> 1:08:56.882
-Chief Hong, is that you?
-Yes.

1:08:56.966 --> 1:08:58.551
It's very hot this morning.

1:09:03.389 --> 1:09:04.640
CHUNG-HO MILK

1:09:10.146 --> 1:09:11.230
Ms. Gam-ri!

1:09:12.356 --> 1:09:13.190
What?

1:09:14.191 --> 1:09:15.025
Hey.

1:09:19.697 --> 1:09:21.115
This is tasty.

1:09:22.199 --> 1:09:25.703
Thanks to you,
I get to drink milk for free.

1:09:27.037 --> 1:09:29.165
Drink as much as you want.

1:09:29.248 --> 1:09:31.250
It's good for your bones.

1:09:32.334 --> 1:09:35.421
Can you bring me chocolate milk tomorrow?

1:09:35.504 --> 1:09:38.549
I can't. Do you like going to the dentist?

1:09:39.633 --> 1:09:44.013
I need you to bring
that director guy to me today.

1:09:44.597 --> 1:09:45.472
What?

1:09:46.348 --> 1:09:48.100
Tell him he can borrow my house.

1:09:49.727 --> 1:09:52.271
Are you sure? Is that really okay?

1:09:52.354 --> 1:09:53.230
Yes.

1:09:55.816 --> 1:09:59.737
I've been living in this house
for 50 years now.

1:10:00.613 --> 1:10:02.656
I gave births in this house,

1:10:02.740 --> 1:10:07.453
and all my children are
now grown up and married.

1:10:08.162 --> 1:10:10.581
I'm left alone in this empty house.

1:10:11.165 --> 1:10:13.500
If I let people have fun here,

1:10:13.584 --> 1:10:16.670
the house will feel less lonely. Right?

1:10:17.213 --> 1:10:19.381
You didn't feel lonely yesterday, did you?

1:10:19.465 --> 1:10:22.676
Stop teasing this old lady.

1:10:24.011 --> 1:10:25.137
I'll tell him today.

1:10:25.638 --> 1:10:27.348
I'm happy as long as you're happy.

1:10:29.391 --> 1:10:30.226
Goodness.

1:10:50.454 --> 1:10:52.581
<i>If you're up, open the front door.</i>

1:11:13.394 --> 1:11:14.478
Seong-hyeon.

1:11:14.561 --> 1:11:17.273
<i>Are you up? I hope I didn't wake you up.</i>

1:11:17.356 --> 1:11:20.359
No, you didn't. But what's this?

1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:23.112
Did you drop by?

1:11:23.779 --> 1:11:25.990
I promised to treat you to something nice.

1:11:26.991 --> 1:11:30.035
But since you must want to rest at home,
I delivered it to your door.

1:11:30.536 --> 1:11:33.497
There aren't any brunch places
around here.

1:11:33.580 --> 1:11:34.999
Did you travel a long way?

1:11:35.082 --> 1:11:37.793
<i>Don't worry. I'm not that busy yet.</i>

1:11:38.377 --> 1:11:41.630
But let's have a proper meal soon.

1:11:42.548 --> 1:11:45.467
Okay. Let me treat you then.

1:11:45.551 --> 1:11:47.594
I'll have a five-course meal at least.

1:11:47.678 --> 1:11:50.681
A meal that takes forever
and leaves you stuffed.

1:11:50.764 --> 1:11:51.974
Sure.

1:11:52.474 --> 1:11:56.103
My clinic is doing well these days.
So let me treat you.

1:12:00.691 --> 1:12:01.692
I'm relieved.

1:12:02.443 --> 1:12:03.360
<i>What?</i>

1:12:04.153 --> 1:12:06.363
I sometimes wondered

1:12:06.447 --> 1:12:09.366
if you were still running around
in a hurry all the time

1:12:09.450 --> 1:12:12.536
<i>and if you were sleeping and eating well.</i>

1:12:13.746 --> 1:12:17.333
<i>The 20-year-old Yoon Hye-jin I knew
was always busy and stressed.</i>

1:12:18.292 --> 1:12:21.920
But you don't seem to be
like that anymore. I'm glad.

1:12:24.423 --> 1:12:26.133
<i>I'm relieved, Hye-jin.</i>

1:12:28.802 --> 1:12:31.096
<i>The call is busy…</i>

1:12:31.180 --> 1:12:34.600
She's still on the phone?
Should I pick up breakfast or not?

1:12:35.100 --> 1:12:36.101
Ms. Pyo.

1:12:37.519 --> 1:12:39.313
Hello.

1:12:39.396 --> 1:12:40.522
Did you take a bath?

1:12:40.606 --> 1:12:43.400
Yes. See you around.

1:12:43.484 --> 1:12:44.777
Hold on.

1:12:44.860 --> 1:12:47.404
Please, wait here for a second.

1:12:47.488 --> 1:12:50.616
No, I… Officer Choi!

1:12:51.408 --> 1:12:54.870
Gosh. I don't have any makeup on.

1:12:55.579 --> 1:12:57.790
I look so unkempt right now.

1:13:06.340 --> 1:13:07.966
-Take this.
-What?

1:13:08.050 --> 1:13:11.345
It's rotisserie chicken.
You said you like it.

1:13:12.805 --> 1:13:14.681
Thank you.

1:13:15.307 --> 1:13:16.809
But why are you giving me this?

1:13:16.892 --> 1:13:18.852
With the lottery ticket you gave me,

1:13:19.812 --> 1:13:21.105
I won 5,000 won.

1:13:23.649 --> 1:13:24.608
Enjoy then.

1:13:30.739 --> 1:13:32.616
But this is more expensive.

1:13:33.534 --> 1:13:35.077
This costs 7,000 won.

1:13:38.705 --> 1:13:41.792
You're not allowed to change
the way the house looks.

1:13:41.875 --> 1:13:44.837
-I wasn't planning to.
-Even inside.

1:13:44.920 --> 1:13:48.257
Ask Ms. Gam-ri's permission
before making even the slightest change.

1:13:48.340 --> 1:13:50.592
The moment you change anything,

1:13:50.676 --> 1:13:54.096
you're forced to return the house to her.
Add that in the contract.

1:13:54.179 --> 1:13:56.432
Sure, no problem.

1:13:58.142 --> 1:14:01.687
Also, it's your responsibility
to restore any damages found afterwards.

1:14:01.770 --> 1:14:04.314
Add that as a special clause.

1:14:04.398 --> 1:14:05.732
-Deal.
-Write it down.

1:14:08.944 --> 1:14:10.904
-Make sure to pay her enough.
-Of course.

1:14:11.697 --> 1:14:13.615
I know it's none of my business,

1:14:13.699 --> 1:14:17.619
but is it okay to say yes to everything?
Shouldn't you be more meticulous?

1:14:17.703 --> 1:14:20.372
Chief Hong, do you like baseball?

1:14:20.456 --> 1:14:24.084
Not really, but I know the rules.

1:14:24.626 --> 1:14:27.504
They say baseball is a pitchers' game.

1:14:27.588 --> 1:14:30.841
Good pitchers don't always
throw the ball as hard as they can.

1:14:30.924 --> 1:14:35.554
Sometimes, they save their energy
and control their power

1:14:35.637 --> 1:14:38.348
so that they can throw at full speed
at a crucial moment.

1:14:38.432 --> 1:14:40.142
I'm the same.

1:14:40.225 --> 1:14:41.852
I don't sweat the small stuff.

1:14:41.935 --> 1:14:43.896
So you're saying you're a good director.

1:14:43.979 --> 1:14:45.564
You're unbelievable.

1:14:45.647 --> 1:14:47.524
Is that how it sounds?

1:14:50.986 --> 1:14:53.780
There's something I want to know.

1:14:53.864 --> 1:14:54.740
Okay.

1:14:56.950 --> 1:14:58.494
Is Hye-jin seeing anyone?

1:15:08.921 --> 1:15:10.047
I can't believe him.

1:15:10.881 --> 1:15:14.426
How am I going to eat all this?

1:15:24.728 --> 1:15:26.271
Is she seeing anyone or not?

1:15:27.481 --> 1:15:28.982
I don't think she is.

1:15:32.152 --> 1:15:33.237
That's good.

1:15:58.595 --> 1:15:59.721
Hey.

1:16:03.225 --> 1:16:04.351
Du-sik.

1:16:05.185 --> 1:16:06.186
Chief Hong.

1:16:08.605 --> 1:16:09.773
What are you doing here?

1:16:11.066 --> 1:16:12.234
Are you asleep?

1:16:13.777 --> 1:16:16.655
So you can't hold your liquor after all.

1:16:21.326 --> 1:16:26.790
Chief Hong, if you sleep here,
you'll get facial nerve paralysis.

1:16:26.873 --> 1:16:28.750
Do you know what that is?

1:16:29.543 --> 1:16:31.086
Did you watch the show, <i>Hur Jun</i>?

1:16:31.670 --> 1:16:33.589
If you did, you'd know.

1:16:34.923 --> 1:16:39.303
Gosh, what do I do?
I have to work tomorrow.

1:16:41.888 --> 1:16:42.931
Chief Hong.

1:16:44.850 --> 1:16:47.269
Facial paralysis means
your face will get twisted.

1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:56.320
Hey. You opened your eyes.

1:17:03.952 --> 1:17:05.746
Why are you looking at me like that?

1:17:08.540 --> 1:17:11.960
Hold on. I know that look in your eyes.

1:17:13.337 --> 1:17:17.549
It means you want to cry.

1:17:22.012 --> 1:17:23.305
Are you crying?

1:17:24.681 --> 1:17:25.557
Don't cry.

1:17:29.561 --> 1:17:31.813
Do you cry when you're drunk?

1:17:32.397 --> 1:17:34.816
It's dangerous to sleep outside.

1:17:34.900 --> 1:17:37.778
Let me get you up on three.

1:17:37.861 --> 1:17:41.615
Here we go. One, two, three.

1:17:42.240 --> 1:17:43.617
Gosh.

1:17:47.245 --> 1:17:48.246
Don't go.

1:17:56.380 --> 1:17:57.714
Don't…

1:17:59.508 --> 1:18:00.759
leave me behind.

1:18:08.558 --> 1:18:09.559
Don't go…

1:18:12.437 --> 1:18:13.522
I won't.

1:18:16.316 --> 1:18:17.943
I'm not going anywhere.

1:18:19.653 --> 1:18:21.613
Don't worry, Chief Hong.

1:18:24.991 --> 1:18:26.660
I'm not going anywhere.

1:19:16.710 --> 1:19:20.088
<i>Guys aren't nice for just any girl.</i>

1:19:20.172 --> 1:19:23.300
<i>Being kind is just
a part of Seong-hyeon's nature.</i>

1:19:23.383 --> 1:19:25.469
For three seconds,
shout at the top of your lungs!

1:19:26.344 --> 1:19:27.679
Down on the board!

1:19:28.513 --> 1:19:30.932
<i>-This looks so good.
-Excuse me.</i>

1:19:31.016 --> 1:19:32.642
Are you Yoon Hye-jin, the dental major?

1:19:32.726 --> 1:19:34.644
I'm Ji Seong-hyeon.

1:19:34.728 --> 1:19:38.482
<i>I'm just asking
because it's all in the past now.</i>

1:19:38.565 --> 1:19:40.442
-Is Chief Hong a good kisser?
-Are you nuts?

1:19:48.700 --> 1:19:53.705
