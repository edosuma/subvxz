You think if your boyfriend

00:10.873 --> 00:12.870
- You're leaving?
- There's nothing left for me here.

Tandy: Last week's number 1
came on the charts at 68,000,

Number 2 or lower is not an option.

All right, Merle Haggard
or Waylon Jennings?

00:59.814 --> 01:02.933
Oh. Uh, Waylon never took me on
the road, so I'm gonna say Merle.

- I'm gonna give it to her.
- That's a nice present.

01:24.055 --> 01:25.561
Yeah, well, it's fun
to be able to spoil her.

01:25.562 --> 01:27.555
Plus, she's getting really good.

01:28.023 --> 01:29.719
Much better than some people I know.

01:29.720 --> 01:31.480
I never had to be good. I always had you.

sign us all to Highway 65,

be better than flowers.

up against each other

I also have a call in to the stage
company... live-stream setup, too.

08:24.970 --> 08:26.226
Yeah, we're gonna have
to get the word out there.

08:26.227 --> 08:28.162
- Get the team facebooking and tweeting.
- Yep.

08:28.163 --> 08:30.625
Let's get ahold of radio...
whatever we have to do to set up

08:30.626 --> 08:32.539
a stadium show in five minutes flat.

08:33.065 --> 08:35.030
- Screw Jeff Fordham.
- Great job.

08:35.032 --> 08:36.546
Thanks, y'all. [Knock on door]

08:36.547 --> 08:37.669
Oh, I think that's Juliette.

08:37.669 --> 08:38.611
She wanted to have a
meeting for some reason.

08:38.613 --> 08:39.828
Tandy: Bye.

08:39.828 --> 08:41.176
[Groans]

08:41.177 --> 08:42.437
Hey. What's going on?

08:42.438 --> 08:44.715
I think I made a terrible
mistake signing with you,

08:44.716 --> 08:45.850
and I would like out.

08:45.851 --> 08:47.040
Juliette, we have a contract.

08:47.041 --> 08:49.756
I'm aware of that, and I
would like it nullified...

08:49.757 --> 08:52.317
Or voided or whatever
it is that we have to do.

08:52.318 --> 08:55.414
We can shake hands and part friends...

08:55.415 --> 08:56.673
Or whatever it is we are.

08:56.674 --> 08:59.203
Okay, would you mind sharing
with me what happened,

08:59.204 --> 09:01.807
considering the fact that I just
came through for you at fort Campbell?

09:01.808 --> 09:04.754
See, you come through for
me at some dinky, little show

09:04.755 --> 09:06.079
that's totally off the grid,

09:06.080 --> 09:07.506
and you think that that's a big deal.

09:07.507 --> 09:08.857
I mean, let's get real, Rayna.

09:08.858 --> 09:12.592
You are not big enough to
service an artist like me.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.671
Juliette, you are dangerously close

09:14.999 --> 09:19.407
<i>to seeing exactly what I
am big enough to do to you.</i>

09:19.408 --> 09:22.102
I am about to put on a
huge show at LP Field,

09:22.103 --> 09:23.386
which you will be a part of,

09:23.387 --> 09:25.950
and if my album doesn't hit
the charts like a hammer,

09:25.951 --> 09:29.602
<i>there will be no Highway 65
for you or for me, all right?</i>

09:29.603 --> 09:31.577
So get out of my face, you're not fired,

09:31.578 --> 09:33.248
and I don't want to hear about this again!

09:33.249 --> 09:34.818
You don't get this now,

09:34.819 --> 09:37.195
but you are seriously ruining my life!

Hey, have you guys seen Juliette?

09:47.995 --> 09:49.992
She's supposed to be here.
She's performing later.

09:49.993 --> 09:51.487
Uh, no, I haven't seen her. Why?

09:51.488 --> 09:53.817
<i>I mean, it's pretty crowded.
She's probably somewhere.</i>

09:53.818 --> 09:55.426
I mean, that's true. She could be anywhere.

09:56.884 --> 09:58.045
Everything okay?

09:59.609 --> 10:00.835
All right.

10:00.836 --> 10:02.633
Well, thanks again for doing this for me.

10:09.019 --> 10:10.038
Hey.

10:10.039 --> 10:11.168
Rayna: Hey, can I catch
up with you in a second?

10:11.169 --> 10:12.981
- Yeah, I'll get us some seats.
- Thanks, babe.

10:12.982 --> 10:14.947
- Hey!
- [Chuckling] Hey.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.089
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

10:17.090 --> 10:18.860
Good. I'm glad to see you.

10:18.861 --> 10:20.688
You too. I was gonna call you.

10:20.689 --> 10:23.839
Um, I'm leaving town soon.
I'm gonna go back to school.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.173
I just wanted to thank you for everything.

10:26.536 --> 10:27.984
I didn't mean to put you through all that.

10:27.985 --> 10:29.372
You know, you're gonna be amazing

10:29.373 --> 10:31.017
at whatever you decide to do.

10:31.018 --> 10:32.513
Jeff: Hello, ladies.

10:33.519 --> 10:34.835
[Groans]

10:34.836 --> 10:36.482
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:37.167 --> 10:38.849
Pretty slick move with LP Field.

10:39.285 --> 10:41.451
Guess you're not above using
your personal connections

10:41.452 --> 10:42.520
to get what you want.

10:42.521 --> 10:44.889
You mean, the way you used
your "personal connections"

10:44.890 --> 10:46.763
to snake my GMA appearance?

10:46.764 --> 10:48.547
And, you know, Will's just a newbie.

10:48.548 --> 10:49.956
It's not like one appearance like that's

10:49.957 --> 10:51.088
gonna make a dent for him.

10:51.089 --> 10:51.802
Touché.

10:51.803 --> 10:54.304
However, sadly for you,
even if you pack the place,

10:54.305 --> 10:56.649
it won't be enough to
top the 200,000 downloads

10:56.650 --> 10:58.473
that I've guaranteed my newbie.

10:58.474 --> 11:01.796
<i>And meanwhile, until Juliette leaves
you to come back to a real label,</i>

11:01.797 --> 11:03.793
you can keep yourself
busy doing damage control

11:03.794 --> 11:05.900
<i>for your one remaining artist.</i>

11:06.830 --> 11:08.677
And you'll have your hands full.

11:09.545 --> 11:11.177
<i>I know I did.</i>

11:14.604 --> 11:16.075
Hey, did y'all pick a movie?

11:16.076 --> 11:17.395
No, not yet.

11:17.396 --> 11:19.337
- Where's Maddie?
- She's in her room.

11:19.338 --> 11:21.767
She said, "I don't want to watch
any stupid movies with you,"

11:21.768 --> 11:22.847
so I said, "fine.

11:22.848 --> 11:25.010
I don't want to watch any
stupid movies with you, either."

11:25.011 --> 11:26.419
- And then...
- Okay. Okay, okay, I get it.

11:26.420 --> 11:28.397
Don't worry about your sister.
You pick whatever you want.

11:29.732 --> 11:32.300
Hey, dad, since Maddie's
taking guitar lessons,

11:32.301 --> 11:34.187
can I maybe take lessons, too?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.431
I mean, ukulele, mandolin.

11:37.432 --> 11:40.094
Ooh. Or drums. Luke
plays drums. They're cool.

11:40.907 --> 11:42.622
I appreciate y'all coming out tonight

11:42.623 --> 11:44.943
to support the Heart
Fellowship Recovery Center.

11:44.944 --> 11:47.074
Sobriety is not a onetime fight.

11:47.075 --> 11:49.654
It goes on... one day
at a time, as we say...

11:49.655 --> 11:50.944
for your entire life.

11:50.945 --> 11:52.180
If you're gonna do a fight that long,

11:52.181 --> 11:54.466
you better have yourself a support system.

11:54.467 --> 11:56.496
For me, that happens to be my family.

11:56.497 --> 11:58.908
Got my niece Scarlett, who keeps me honest.

11:58.909 --> 12:01.455
I also got my daughter,
Maddie, who's helped me...

12:01.456 --> 12:03.317
well, to see the world
through brand-new eyes.

12:03.318 --> 12:05.600
And both of them have shown me
what it means to love somebody

12:05.601 --> 12:09.154
more than I love myself, which
has given my life meaning.

12:09.155 --> 12:11.379
That's what this center's about.
That's what this night is about.

12:11.380 --> 12:13.433
It's about not being defined by your past.

12:13.434 --> 12:15.329
It's about finding a way to move forward.

12:15.330 --> 12:18.166
- Good speech.
- We thank y'all for your help.

12:18.167 --> 12:19.434
Yeah, it is.

12:19.435 --> 12:20.730
I'm excited to introduce
some great musicians,

12:20.731 --> 12:21.723
some good friends of mine...

12:21.724 --> 12:24.801
Gunnar Scott, Avery
barkley, and Zoey Dalton.

12:24.802 --> 12:26.120

him. He's gonna enjoy it.

hell's going on here?

17:23.578 --> 17:25.871
You two have been acting
weird around me for days.

17:25.872 --> 17:27.193
Is it Juliette?

17:28.218 --> 17:29.905
Something happen?

17:31.981 --> 17:33.576
Tell me.

17:36.283 --> 17:37.611
[Door closes]

17:46.829 --> 17:48.311
Tell me it isn't true.

17:52.791 --> 17:54.106
Please.

17:55.413 --> 17:57.143
Tell me I heard wrong.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.634
[Voice breaking] You didn't hear wrong.

17:58.635 --> 18:01.337
It's... It's true.

18:01.338 --> 18:02.862
I don't know why.

18:02.863 --> 18:04.795
I hate myself for it.

18:04.796 --> 18:07.916
It was a mistake. It was a
mistake. It meant nothing.

18:07.917 --> 18:09.259
- It meant nothing?
- Nothing.

18:09.260 --> 18:10.696
That almost makes it worse.

18:11.851 --> 18:14.576
<i>Does it ever mean anything to you?</i>

18:14.577 --> 18:16.781
<i>Yes! Yes, it does with you.</i>

18:16.782 --> 18:18.320
How the hell am I supposed to believe that?

18:18.321 --> 18:20.822
Because it's true, and
you know it. I love you.

18:20.823 --> 18:23.096
Hey, don't... Don't say that.

18:23.531 --> 18:26.688
You have no clue what love is.

18:26.689 --> 18:30.404
To you, love is... is 50,000
fans worshipping you every night.

18:30.405 --> 18:31.964
All hail queen Juliette!

18:31.965 --> 18:36.111
You have no idea what it means
to actually love another person,

18:36.112 --> 18:37.553
because when you do,

18:37.554 --> 18:41.181
you wod rather die than hurt them.

18:42.700 --> 18:47.194
I'm [Sniffles] I'm sorry. I love you.

18:47.195 --> 18:49.090
<i>I love you, and you love me.</i>

18:49.450 --> 18:51.686
- You love me.
- Yes.

18:52.523 --> 18:53.533
[Gulps]

18:53.534 --> 18:56.062
You have no idea how much I love you.

18:56.416 --> 18:57.467
I do.

18:58.352 --> 19:00.902
But that's something I'm
gonna have to get over.

19:03.626 --> 19:04.988
No.

19:06.273 --> 19:07.834
[Sobbing]

19:08.162 --> 19:11.361
[Door opens] I'm sorry!

19:17.674 --> 19:19.278
- Gift cards.
- What?

19:19.279 --> 19:21.115
Sam Boone's Superstore gift cards.

19:21.116 --> 19:23.711
200,000 of them all come
with Will's smiling face

19:23.712 --> 19:25.630
and a download of his album.

19:25.631 --> 19:26.804
[Bucky sighs] Oh, my God.

19:26.805 --> 19:28.835
Okay, I went to business
school with Sam Boone's son.

19:28.836 --> 19:30.874
Well, I know Sam Boone.

19:30.875 --> 19:32.446
I swear, why can't anything ever be easy?

19:32.447 --> 19:34.091
<i>It is easy. All you do is
you make the phone call.</i>

19:34.092 --> 19:35.551
Oh, how's that phone call gonna go?

19:35.552 --> 19:36.763
Okay, what am I missing here?

19:36.764 --> 19:38.896
Sam Boone... the one I
basically told to go to hell

19:38.897 --> 19:41.153
when he was gonna pull all of Juliette
Barnes' records off the shelves

19:41.154 --> 19:43.631
in my great effort to
combat corporate censorship.

19:43.632 --> 19:47.105
There is a place for principles
and ethics and all of that,

19:47.106 --> 19:48.391
but it's not in business.

19:48.392 --> 19:50.408
- Oh, hello, daddy.
- Point taken.

19:50.409 --> 19:53.228
Are you going to make
the phone call or not?

20:00.859 --> 20:01.942
Morning.

20:05.420 --> 20:06.597
You drink coffee now?

20:06.598 --> 20:08.059
Why? Do you think I shouldn't?

20:09.581 --> 20:10.803
[Chuckles]

20:11.252 --> 20:12.585
What?!

20:12.586 --> 20:13.942
What is going ok?

20:13.943 --> 20:15.919
You know you can talk to me
about anything. What is it?

20:15.920 --> 20:16.971
Is it boy trouble?

20:16.972 --> 20:18.970
I'm not talking to my dad about boys.

20:18.971 --> 20:20.271
It's not even that.

20:20.272 --> 20:21.893
Mom and Deacon are just being lame.

20:23.382 --> 20:25.202
I want mom to sign me to her label,

20:25.203 --> 20:27.840
and they don't think it's a
good idea because I'm too young.

20:27.841 --> 20:29.216
I understand. It's frustrating.

20:29.217 --> 20:31.154
But it's not always
such a bad thing to wait.

20:31.155 --> 20:33.087
- Please don't start.
- Hey, I get where you're coming from.

20:33.088 --> 20:34.961
No, you don't... you're not musical at all,

20:34.962 --> 20:36.300
so there's no way that you can undand

20:36.612 --> 20:38.876
how much it hurts when you
just shut down my dreams.

20:39.408 --> 20:40.623
Honey...

20:44.580 --> 20:45.938
Crazy how things turn out.

20:45.939 --> 20:48.516
I mean, who would have thought
I'd be going off on a big tour

20:48.517 --> 20:50.814
and you'd be moving back to Mississippi?

20:51.218 --> 20:52.708
All worked out for the best.

20:52.709 --> 20:54.589
I just wish I hadn't wasted so much time

20:54.590 --> 20:55.574
being angry at y'all.

20:56.530 --> 20:58.708
I should have just been
happy for you from the start.

20:58.709 --> 20:59.953
Gunnar's a great guy.

21:00.653 --> 21:03.647
Think you might... Swing
by on your way out of town,

21:03.648 --> 21:04.616
say goodbye?

21:04.617 --> 21:07.303
Uh, I don't think he's particularly
interested in talking to me.

21:07.304 --> 21:08.574
I ven't heard from him in a while.

21:08.575 --> 21:10.606
Oh. Well, he gave me this to give to you.

21:10.945 --> 21:13.114
It's on a thumb drive. You need to hear it.

21:15.235 --> 21:18.147
What I need is one last
round at the loveless café.

21:18.148 --> 21:19.214
You up for it?

21:19.215 --> 21:21.741
Sure. I'll even spring for the check.

21:21.742 --> 21:23.498
Lord, I'll even let you.

21:23.499 --> 21:24.444
[Chuckles]

21:24.445 --> 21:26.013
<i>God knows that I try,</i>

21:26.014 --> 21:29.204
<i>and he has to meet me halfway, you know?</i>

21:29.205 --> 21:30.954
<i>I mean, that's what marriage is.</i>

21:31.323 --> 21:32.420
<i>I don't know.</i>

21:32.421 --> 21:34.887
<i>Sometimes I think maybe
he's tired of me already.</i>

21:37.088 --> 21:38.813
Will, how does that make you feel?

21:38.814 --> 21:40.806
<i>How do you think it makes me feel?</i>

21:40.807 --> 21:43.282
I feel terrible seeing the hurt in her eyes

21:43.283 --> 21:45.773
and knowing I'm the one that caused it.

21:45.774 --> 21:46.649
But it...

21:47.352 --> 21:50.513
<i>I do love her, even if I'm
not always great at showing it.</i>

21:50.514 --> 21:52.175
It's just the pressure, you know?

21:52.176 --> 21:55.484
I mean...[Sighs] This is my shot.

21:56.064 --> 21:58.177
Everything is riding on this album.

21:58.481 --> 22:00.026
Everything.

22:05.184 --> 22:06.594
Deacon: You know, you
didn't have to do this.

22:06.595 --> 22:07.744
I could have dropped it off for you.

22:07.745 --> 22:09.668
No, you know, I was over at soundcheck.

22:09.669 --> 22:10.985
It's right on the way.

22:10.986 --> 22:12.465
- How's that album launch going?
- Good.

22:15.207 --> 22:16.599
Yeah.

22:16.944 --> 22:18.344
Something on your mind, Ray?

22:18.345 --> 22:19.858
No, I...

22:19.859 --> 22:22.435
Well, you know, I mean, it's
just... it's a huge week,

22:22.436 --> 22:25.256
and I have bet the house
on this album, literally,

22:25.257 --> 22:26.804
and that idiot at Edgehill

22:26.805 --> 22:28.533
is trying to complely screw me over.

22:28.534 --> 22:31.093
<i>And I have the opportunity
to, you know, screw him over</i>

22:31.094 --> 22:32.120
and actually win the week,

22:32.121 --> 22:34.376
but then it would make me feel
like I was just basically...

22:35.077 --> 22:36.196
Selling out.

22:36.197 --> 22:37.172
Like what?

22:37.173 --> 22:40.087
Like, it involves plastic,
and... it doesn't even matter.

22:40.088 --> 22:42.615
Look, I know we're a long
way from where we started...

22:43.580 --> 22:45.415
that business we grew up in...

22:47.231 --> 22:48.932
yeah, that's gone.

22:48.933 --> 22:50.426
You got everything riding on this,

22:50.427 --> 22:52.902
I say that you do what
you have to to make it fly,

22:52.903 --> 22:54.383
and you kick his ass.

22:54.384 --> 22:56.269
You won't find any judgment here.

22:56.270 --> 22:57.462
Thank you.

22:57.463 --> 22:58.521
[Chuckles]

22:58.970 --> 23:01.443
I sure as hell wish it
was the way it used to be.

23:07.221 --> 23:08.368
[Clears throat]

23:09.094 --> 23:10.388
[Sighing] All right.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.532
- [Whistles]
- Oh.

23:12.857 --> 23:14.310
Thank you.

23:22.355 --> 23:24.096
I was never good with guitars.

23:25.331 --> 23:26.582
[Door closes]

23:34.242 --> 23:37.609
Launch day! Check out this prototype.

23:37.610 --> 23:39.244
You're gonna see this
gorgeous, smiling face

23:39.245 --> 23:41.512
all over Boone's
Superstores starting today.

23:41.513 --> 23:43.108
[Cellphone buzzing] Oh.

23:43.109 --> 23:44.557
Jeff Fordham.

23:45.078 --> 23:46.248
Hey, Jeff.

23:47.183 --> 23:48.650
Wait... what?

23:49.730 --> 23:50.963
How is that even possible?

23:56.396 --> 23:58.181
Went with another artist?

24:00.253 --> 24:02.026
What do you mean, you don't know?

24:02.027 --> 24:03.723
Wha... I thought this was a done deal.

24:07.778 --> 24:09.709
Aww. They're from Luke.

24:09.710 --> 24:11.288
I know. Aren't they gorgeous?

24:11.289 --> 24:13.208
Wow! Look at those!

24:13.209 --> 24:14.993
You can put those right over here.

24:14.994 --> 24:17.156
- Sam Boone. Ha!
- Oh.

24:17.157 --> 24:18.317
[Both laugh]

24:18.318 --> 24:19.412
Thank you.

24:20.653 --> 24:21.600
Hey.

24:28.283 --> 24:29.267
So?

24:29.268 --> 24:30.524
I hurt him.

24:31.242 --> 24:32.594
Really bad.

24:32.595 --> 24:34.890
And I don't think he's coming back, so...

24:35.865 --> 24:37.269
I'm here. [Chuckles]

24:37.270 --> 24:38.819
You don't have to go on
tonight if you don't want to.

24:38.820 --> 24:42.533
No. No. We're gonna go up there
and do exactly what you said

24:42.534 --> 24:43.935
we're gonna kill it.

24:43.936 --> 24:45.946
<i>And I'm gonna have your
back, like you had mine.</i>

24:45.947 --> 24:46.905
[Knock on door]

24:46.906 --> 24:48.973
Here he is. Is now a good time?

24:48.974 --> 24:52.376
<i>Now is a perfect time.</i>

24:52.377 --> 24:53.997
Okay.

24:53.998 --> 24:55.191
Hey, Jeff.

24:55.192 --> 24:57.000
<i>Didn't expect tickets to this show.</i>

24:57.001 --> 24:59.159
You see Will crush it on GMA?

24:59.160 --> 25:00.347
- Oh, I missed that.
- Yeah.

25:00.348 --> 25:01.981
- Yeah.
- Hey, Jeff.

25:01.982 --> 25:04.230
Thanks for the worst minute
and a half of my life.

25:04.231 --> 25:07.079
And you don't have to trouble
yourself with telling Avery.

25:07.080 --> 25:09.728
You were right... he didn't understand.

25:09.729 --> 25:12.379
<i>In fact, I don't think
I understand, either.</i>

25:12.380 --> 25:13.884
I-I definitely don't understand.

25:13.885 --> 25:15.500
Oh, she's staying at Highway 65.

25:15.501 --> 25:16.541
Shs not going back to Edgehill.

25:17.729 --> 25:18.854
[Scoffs]

25:18.855 --> 25:20.289
Is that why you invited me?

25:20.290 --> 25:22.859
To let me know that you're
holding on to damaged goods?

25:23.375 --> 25:24.653
Good one.

25:25.423 --> 25:27.120
Hey, you didn't happen to, uh,

25:27.458 --> 25:29.242
tell Luke about any of this, did you?

25:29.243 --> 25:30.459
Oh, your adventures in blackmail?

25:30.460 --> 25:32.661
No, I thought I would hold
on to that card for later.

25:32.662 --> 25:35.680
<i>And I have a card for you to hold on to.</i>

25:35.681 --> 25:38.221
About 250,000 of those
are going out this week...

25:38.222 --> 25:41.060
in place of the Will Lexington ones.

25:41.061 --> 25:42.207
Hey, Jeff.

25:43.117 --> 25:44.679
The door's over here.

25:46.481 --> 25:47.663
No?

25:48.271 --> 25:49.549
Enjoy the show.

25:59.075 --> 26:00.588
Hey, hey, look. Look. [Laughs]

26:01.389 --> 26:02.851
Isn't this amazing?

26:02.852 --> 26:04.164
Yes!

26:05.315 --> 26:06.733
Deacon: Hey, guys.

26:06.734 --> 26:07.877
Hey.

26:07.878 --> 26:09.578
- Pretty amazing, huh?
- It is!

26:10.448 --> 26:11.729
So amazing.

26:13.015 --> 26:14.227
[Knock on door]

26:14.228 --> 26:15.712
- Luke: Knock, knock.
- Hey!

26:15.713 --> 26:17.156
[Laughs]

26:17.961 --> 26:19.377
You are a vision.

26:19.808 --> 26:21.225
You're not so bad yourself.

26:21.226 --> 26:23.319
I know... lips. I won't mess you up.

26:23.320 --> 26:24.873
Oh. [Laughs, smooches]

26:24.874 --> 26:26.070
I hope you can mess me up later.

26:26.071 --> 26:27.004
[Laughs]

26:27.005 --> 26:28.853
Oh, I got nothing but surprises
in store for you later.

26:28.854 --> 26:30.072
Ooh. Good.

26:30.073 --> 26:32.253
Oh, girl, I am so proud of you.

26:32.581 --> 26:35.721
You are the most amazing, most beautiful...

26:35.722 --> 26:37.196
[knock on door] Sorry, guys.

26:37.197 --> 26:39.159
- Time to suit up, Ray.
- Thank you.

26:39.160 --> 26:40.735
Luke: I will finish this later.

26:41.234 --> 26:42.824
You still want to close
with "Ball and Chain"?

26:43.161 --> 26:44.839
- You bet.
- All right.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.668
I'm gonna go put on my rig
and, uh, powder my nose.

26:47.669 --> 26:48.390
[Laughing] Okay.

26:48.391 --> 26:49.852
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:59.714 --> 27:01.215
Thank you...

27:02.227 --> 27:03.983
For my children...

27:05.650 --> 27:07.905
And for that wonderful man.

27:09.697 --> 27:11.855
Thank you for making me strong...

27:13.268 --> 27:15.287
And for so many blessings.

27:21.065 --> 27:23.040
Thank you for letting me live.

27:23.765 --> 27:25.405
[Cheers and applause]

27:28.485 --> 27:31.228
[Audience chanting "Rayna!"]

Deacon.

40:37.460 --> 40:38.438
Come on, now.

40:38.439 --> 40:40.365
What... I just wanted to come
over and say congratulations

40:40.366 --> 40:41.995
and what a great guy he is

40:41.996 --> 40:43.630
and that I hope you'll both be very happy.

40:44.337 --> 40:45.754
Thank you.

40:46.306 --> 40:47.882
But I can't.

40:48.388 --> 40:49.859
[Sighs] Why not?

40:49.860 --> 40:51.252
'Cause it's a lie.

40:51.253 --> 40:52.804
I was angry when I thought
you were lying to me,

40:52.805 --> 40:54.305
<i>so I'm not gonna lie to you.</i>

40:54.306 --> 40:55.509

No, you don't.

This thing of ours...

I know what I've done.

41:02.874 --> 41:04.591
I broke your heart a
thousand different ways,

41:04.592 --> 41:06.409
and, God, I am sorry for that.

41:06.410 --> 41:07.690
But something changed.

me to be... I am that man.</i>

And I can be a husband
now, and I can be a father.

41:21.737 --> 41:22.847
And I can give you everything

41:22.848 --> 41:24.620
that we were always meant to have.

41:24.621 --> 41:26.897
And maybe I'm too late, and
maybe I should just move on,

41:26.898 --> 41:28.189

I've tried like hell, but
all that ever happens...
