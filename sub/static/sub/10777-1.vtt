01:18.455 --> 01:20.780
<i>Bowfinger International Pictures.</i>

01:20.874 --> 01:22.701
<i>This is Cherisse from AT&T.</i>

01:22.835 --> 01:26.880
<i>We're wondering if your payment
for $5.43 has gone astray. Call us.</i>

01:27.173 --> 01:28.336
<i>Just a reminder.</i>

01:28.424 --> 01:32.209
<i>We no longer need access to
your residence to disconnect your phone.</i>

02:21.400 --> 02:23.274
Great script.

02:37.626 --> 02:39.999
Betsy, it's now or never.

02:41.380 --> 02:43.373
We are gonna make a movie.

02:43.466 --> 02:46.586
<i>- Bowfinger International Pictures.
- It's Carol.</i>

02:46.928 --> 02:50.878
<i>How do I say this? I have an offer
to go to Edmonton to do Cats.</i>

02:51.099 --> 02:53.306
<i>It's a small role, but I've got to take it.</i>

02:53.394 --> 02:55.517
<i>- You keep promising me...
- No!</i>

02:55.896 --> 02:58.684
<i>...but it's been 8 months.
- Carol, don't take that job.</i>

02:58.775 --> 03:01.266
We're gonna make a motion picture.
I promise you.

03:01.361 --> 03:03.899
<i>- But you've promised before.
- I know.</i>

03:03.989 --> 03:06.527
<i>- Be here tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.
- I can't afford...</i>

03:06.617 --> 03:08.610
<i>- Please!
- But you always...</i>

03:16.044 --> 03:18.084
<i>This is Dave. Beep comin'.</i>

03:18.880 --> 03:21.253
Dave, can you get me
a Mercedes tomorrow?

03:21.341 --> 03:24.877
I want you to find out when
and where Jerry Renfro is having lunch.

03:24.970 --> 03:27.972
Just do it. Don't think about it.
You're my buddy.

03:35.065 --> 03:36.346
Come on.

03:37.818 --> 03:41.187
<i>- Hello?
- Afrim? It's Bowfinger. Great script.</i>

03:41.822 --> 03:44.574
You wrote a great script.
Your accounting days are over.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.782
<i>He likes my script!</i>

03:48.496 --> 03:49.991
Afrim? Afrim?

03:50.374 --> 03:53.209
<i>- Be here tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.
- Yes, Boss.</i>

04:06.975 --> 04:08.386
<i>- Slater.
- Who is this?</i>

04:08.477 --> 04:09.852
<i>- Bowfinger.
- 'Bye.</i>

04:09.937 --> 04:12.772
Don't hang up. Be here tomorrow at 10:00.

04:13.858 --> 04:17.310
<i>- That's early.
- Big meeting, 10:00 a.m. Please?</i>

04:32.128 --> 04:34.417
You believe in me, don't you, Betsy?

05:02.620 --> 05:04.862
First of all, thank you for coming.

05:06.333 --> 05:08.907
I know things have been a little slow.

05:09.002 --> 05:11.541
- Very slow.
- Slow and low.

05:11.630 --> 05:12.959
Let him speak.

05:13.633 --> 05:16.717
We are not the big guys.
We are the little guys.

05:16.803 --> 05:20.504
We never had muscle before,
but now we do.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.214
Because last night I read a screenplay...

05:23.352 --> 05:25.890
...that every studio in town
is going to want.

05:25.980 --> 05:29.183
And how did we get this screenplay?
Because Afrim here...

05:29.275 --> 05:33.356
...is a damn fine writer,
and accountant and part-time receptionist.

05:33.697 --> 05:37.362
I said, "Afrim, if you can write
as well as you can add..."

05:37.492 --> 05:39.735
I didn't have to finish my sentence.

05:39.828 --> 05:44.372
Twelve days later
he hands me this masterpiece.

05:45.042 --> 05:46.667
Thank you, Boss.

05:47.253 --> 05:48.961
Tell them the title.

05:49.089 --> 05:50.548
<i>Chubby Rain.</i>

05:51.508 --> 05:52.374
What?

05:52.467 --> 05:54.460
<i>Chubby Rain. Tell them why.</i>

05:54.553 --> 05:58.883
- The aliens come to Earth in raindrops.
- Yeah!

05:59.851 --> 06:02.009
Making the raindrops chubby.

06:02.228 --> 06:05.432
Aliens in the raindrops.
At the end of this movie...

06:05.565 --> 06:09.860
...when our hero, Keith Kincaid,
looks up at the alien antenna and says:

06:10.195 --> 06:11.820
"Gotcha, suckers!"

06:14.116 --> 06:16.275
I mean, that is a moment.

06:19.497 --> 06:20.696
I don't know.

06:20.790 --> 06:24.623
I'll close the deal today.
If I don't, you can go anywhere you want.

06:28.925 --> 06:30.253
Come here.

06:35.849 --> 06:37.640
See that FedEx truck?

06:43.065 --> 06:46.399
Every day, it delivers important papers
to people around the world.

06:46.486 --> 06:48.942
And one day, it is going to stop here...

06:49.030 --> 06:53.858
...a man is going to walk up and casually
toss a couple of FedExes on my desk.

06:54.119 --> 06:56.077
And at that moment, we...

06:56.205 --> 06:59.241
...and by "we" I mean "me,"
will be important.

07:02.128 --> 07:03.457
Now, today...

07:03.546 --> 07:07.046
...I have a very important meeting
with Jerry Renfro.

07:08.302 --> 07:13.178
If it goes the way I think it's gonna go,
I will see you at the Oscars.

08:12.915 --> 08:14.243
Good job, Dave.

08:14.333 --> 08:16.824
Return it in 45 minutes.
I'm supposed to wash it.

08:16.919 --> 08:18.034
Has Renfro left?

08:18.129 --> 08:21.083
Fifteen minutes ago.
He should be at the restaurant now.

08:21.174 --> 08:23.962
If this goes like I think,
I'm making you cameraman.

08:24.052 --> 08:25.215
Know what that means?

08:25.304 --> 08:28.424
- You'd be living up to your promise?
- That's right.

08:28.849 --> 08:32.301
If this movie gets made,
I'm giving you my van.

08:35.690 --> 08:37.184
It is my van.

09:16.527 --> 09:19.897
Could you seat me next to Jerry Renfro?
Thank you.

09:21.533 --> 09:22.992
Tony, how are you?

09:24.161 --> 09:26.118
No. Say the deal back to me.

09:26.538 --> 09:27.783
Net net?

09:27.998 --> 09:30.668
If I'm putting $85 million
into an avalanche movie...

09:30.751 --> 09:33.918
...I gotta know where the snow is.
And it better be Aspen.

09:34.005 --> 09:35.962
And what asshole will direct.

09:36.049 --> 09:38.670
We gotta get a director. Get me a list.

09:38.760 --> 09:42.593
- The star has to be international.
- I need an international star.

09:43.974 --> 09:46.892
- Who's my star?
- How about Kit Ramsey?

09:47.228 --> 09:50.597
Kit Ramsey is the hottest,
sexiest action star in the world.

09:50.690 --> 09:54.605
When I think of Kit Ramsey in this movie,
I get very comfortable.

09:54.695 --> 09:57.233
Yeah, but I won't bid
against Flanehfastah...

09:57.322 --> 10:01.321
...because even if Kit Ramsey's interested,
we might not want him.

10:02.370 --> 10:06.368
Can you believe this? Now they try
to tell us who's gonna be in our movies.

10:06.458 --> 10:08.830
Get me Kit. Get me Kit right now.

10:10.003 --> 10:12.673
You don't put me on hold,
I put you on hold.

10:12.756 --> 10:15.330
Put me on hold and you're a dead man.

10:16.636 --> 10:19.091
How are you? Bobby Bowfinger,
Bowfinger Films.

10:19.180 --> 10:22.134
- We worked on that thing years ago.
- What thing?

10:22.267 --> 10:24.343
The... famous movie.

10:26.605 --> 10:29.061
Hi, Kit. How are you?

10:29.608 --> 10:32.146
My man! How's Dolores?

10:32.904 --> 10:36.071
Good. You are first in line for the script.

10:36.574 --> 10:39.778
- You can't be more first than first.
- Can I talk to him?

10:40.579 --> 10:44.529
- Can I talk to Kit?
- Absolutely. Kit?

10:45.209 --> 10:48.993
Got a surprise for you. Kit?
I'm losing you...

10:50.256 --> 10:52.961
- Bad line?
- These cell phones are so bad.

10:53.051 --> 10:55.459
Universal's begging me for this script.

10:55.554 --> 10:58.923
They screwed me once.
You ought to take a look.

11:02.895 --> 11:05.565
- It starts nice.
- It does, doesn't it?

11:05.690 --> 11:07.683
- All this.
- Yeah. Right.

11:09.277 --> 11:13.110
- "Gotcha, suckers!" That is a catch phrase.
- Isn't that good?

11:13.490 --> 11:15.364
I just saw the poster.

11:16.660 --> 11:19.234
Let's be risky today. I'm going with this.

11:19.330 --> 11:23.827
You bring me this script and Kit Ramsey
and you got yourself a go picture, Bobby.

11:25.504 --> 11:26.998
Okay. Thanks.

11:31.427 --> 11:33.918
I love what you do. Here's my card.

11:36.015 --> 11:37.807
Just keep that.

11:42.230 --> 11:43.476
What was that?

11:43.565 --> 11:46.650
"A go picture! A go picture!"

11:48.070 --> 11:50.396
Do you know anyone who knows
Kit Ramsey?

11:50.782 --> 11:53.451
Damn it! I'm the biggest black
action star in the world!

11:53.535 --> 11:56.204
<i>- Where's my "Hasta la vista, baby"?
- What?</i>

11:56.288 --> 12:00.156
If Arnold Schwarnzen-cracker
is gettin' to say lines like that...

12:00.292 --> 12:03.080
...then I deserve equally well-written shit.

12:03.379 --> 12:05.621
- The script has that moment.
- When?

12:05.798 --> 12:10.461
You say, "I enjoyed meeting you, Cliff."
Then you push the guy right over the cliff.

12:10.554 --> 12:15.299
But the audience has to know
the guy's name is Cliff, and he's on a cliff.

12:15.434 --> 12:18.471
It's too cerebral. We're trying
to make a movie, not a film.

12:18.562 --> 12:20.639
You're supposed to be the agent!

12:20.815 --> 12:24.019
You better find me a line
like the time I told Tommy Lee Jones...

12:24.110 --> 12:26.103
..."Fuck you," and blew his brains out.

12:26.196 --> 12:27.940
You know what's happening?

12:28.073 --> 12:31.774
Another example of the white man
taking all the best catch phrases...

12:31.869 --> 12:34.194
...and then giving them
to Arnold or Stallone.

12:34.288 --> 12:36.862
Exactly. And Jackie Chan and Van Damme.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.206
They can't even speak English good.

12:39.377 --> 12:42.877
There's covert stuff goin' on.
Some covert shit I just found out.

12:42.965 --> 12:45.254
I'm glad you're here. Come in here.

12:45.342 --> 12:47.252
Right now, everybody. Come here.

12:47.344 --> 12:49.883
- What you talkin' about?
- Just for fun...

12:49.972 --> 12:53.887
...I scanned the script to see
how many times the letter "K" appears.

12:55.979 --> 12:59.479
The letter "K" appears
in this script 1,456 times.

12:59.608 --> 13:01.648
That's perfectly divisible by three.

13:01.735 --> 13:04.227
- So what're you saying?
- What am I sayin'?

13:04.322 --> 13:07.691
"KKK" appears in this script 486 times.

13:15.793 --> 13:18.201
- The sickness is deep.
- He's playing you.

13:18.295 --> 13:21.001
- I've been played.
- That's really not the case here.

13:21.090 --> 13:24.625
This is a great script.
It's not Shakespeare, but...

13:24.761 --> 13:28.629
- What'd you just say?
- I said, "It's not Shakespeare, but..."

13:28.724 --> 13:31.215
It's not... Did you hear what he's doing?

13:31.310 --> 13:34.513
He's doing something.
I just can't put my finger on it.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.183
What's he doing?

13:36.357 --> 13:38.599
- Shakespeare, Freddy.
- Shakespeare!

13:38.818 --> 13:41.819
- "Shake-a-spear. Spear-chucker."
- "Shake-a-spear!"

13:41.947 --> 13:43.738
I'm a spear-chucker now.

13:43.824 --> 13:46.397
- Call me a spear-chucker.
- It doesn't mean that!

13:46.493 --> 13:48.451
It's my imagination?

13:48.662 --> 13:51.284
There's no computer chip
in LaToya Jackson's brain.

13:51.374 --> 13:54.577
She just acts like that.
Teddy Kennedy ain't 1/16 black.

13:54.753 --> 13:58.086
- Teddy Kennedy?
- He's different to the other Kennedys.

13:58.173 --> 14:02.218
- I got some calls to make.
- Go make some calls. Call Arnold and Sly!

14:02.344 --> 14:06.259
And Van Damme and Jackie Chan.
Tell 'em the spear-chucker said hello!

14:45.309 --> 14:47.847
Get my door just as fast
as you get Tom Hanks'!

14:47.937 --> 14:51.223
- Wait. Who are you?
- Script delivery from Paramount.

14:51.357 --> 14:54.442
- I ain't expectin' no script from Paramount.
- I mean Universal.

14:54.527 --> 14:57.363
- Maybe so. Come on.
- Gotta have you sign.

14:57.697 --> 15:01.530
- I ain't signing shit.
- It's all good. This script is butter.

15:01.618 --> 15:04.288
- What?
- Butter, butter. This stuff is butter.

15:05.081 --> 15:07.951
It's all good. It's jiggy baby.

15:08.042 --> 15:10.331
How you know it's all good and jiggy baby?

15:10.420 --> 15:13.125
- I was reading it on the way over.
- You read my script?

15:13.215 --> 15:15.967
I loved this script 'cause
it's a twist on the usual.

15:16.051 --> 15:19.302
- It's science fiction, which we know sells...
- You shut up.

15:19.388 --> 15:22.093
I'll whip your ass.
You don't be reading my stuff.

15:22.183 --> 15:25.101
- Get off the property!
- I just got a little excited.

15:25.186 --> 15:27.678
I gotta get over to my MindHead meeting.

15:28.774 --> 15:30.019
MindHead?

15:30.943 --> 15:33.564
- MindHead?
- MindHead! You need a lift?

15:34.196 --> 15:37.363
- I can't believe that!
- Yeah! Come on in.

15:37.658 --> 15:39.319
- Thank you.
- What a coincidence!

15:39.410 --> 15:41.487
- Who's your guide?
- Terry Stricter. Yours?

15:41.579 --> 15:43.371
- Ray.
- Ray?

16:02.561 --> 16:05.728
It's people like you
that give MindHead a bad name!

16:05.815 --> 16:07.724
You lying sack of shit!

16:10.028 --> 16:13.397
Read the script.
I'm really a big-time producer with clout.

16:26.212 --> 16:28.289
<i>Welcome to MindHead.</i>

16:29.841 --> 16:32.130
<i>Welcome to MindHead.</i>

16:43.523 --> 16:46.311
Seems as though
you're doing much better.

16:47.444 --> 16:49.852
- Yes. Yes.
- Your paranoia...

16:50.322 --> 16:53.858
...is definitely under control
since you came to understand...

16:54.202 --> 16:56.111
...Happy Premise Number One.

16:56.955 --> 17:00.039
Happy Premise Number One:
There are no aliens.

17:00.459 --> 17:02.202
Happy Premise Number Two.

17:02.503 --> 17:06.416
Happy Premise Number Two:
There is no giant foot trying to squash me.

17:06.549 --> 17:08.376
Happy Premise Number Three.

17:08.593 --> 17:12.507
Happy Premise Number Three:
Even though I feel like I might ignite...

17:12.806 --> 17:14.430
...I probably won't.

17:14.723 --> 17:16.348
What do we do?

17:20.356 --> 17:22.183
Keep it together.

17:22.316 --> 17:24.771
Keep it together. Keep it together.

17:24.902 --> 17:28.568
And what is it we don't do
under any circumstances?

17:29.699 --> 17:31.739
- Oh, man!
- What is it?

17:32.369 --> 17:34.825
I have to show it to the Laker Girls.

17:34.955 --> 17:37.328
You cannot show it to the Laker Girls.

17:38.167 --> 17:41.168
Keep Mr. Weenie in the pants.

17:41.629 --> 17:43.373
Always in the pants.

17:43.673 --> 17:46.129
I know you want to show it
to the Laker Girls...

17:46.218 --> 17:49.089
...but you must never show it
to the Laker Girls.

18:23.134 --> 18:25.008
What did he say?

18:26.971 --> 18:28.596
Betsy, come here.

18:29.599 --> 18:31.639
Sit! Come.

18:32.603 --> 18:33.682
Sit!

18:35.272 --> 18:38.772
Good girl! Come here. What a good girl.

18:38.901 --> 18:41.653
- Is she amazing, or what?
- What did he say?

18:46.201 --> 18:49.487
I'm at the meeting with Jerry Renfro,
and it's going very well.

18:49.580 --> 18:54.041
But, I'm looking at him and I'm thinking,
I don't need him.

18:54.544 --> 18:57.414
What I need is someone like a Kit Ramsey.

18:57.505 --> 19:00.506
Kit Ramsey makes this a go picture.

19:00.675 --> 19:04.294
- So, I went to see Kit at his home.
- My God.

19:06.724 --> 19:08.099
What did he say?

19:09.852 --> 19:12.474
- What did who say?
- What did Kit Ramsey say?

19:14.941 --> 19:20.067
I'm meeting with Kit at his home...
By the way, he knew who I was.

19:20.948 --> 19:23.819
I gave him the script,
and he looked through the script.

19:23.909 --> 19:28.121
And I said, "So, what do you think?
Are you interested in doing this movie?"

19:32.252 --> 19:34.161
Kit looked at me...

19:36.757 --> 19:38.002
...he said...

19:44.891 --> 19:47.762
Kit, just...

19:50.272 --> 19:51.470
...said:

19:55.111 --> 19:56.190
"Yes."

20:01.660 --> 20:03.617
Kit Ramsey said yes?

20:04.705 --> 20:08.370
Kit Ramsey is doing this movie!

20:21.181 --> 20:24.882
- You told them we'd make this movie?
- That's right, I did.

20:25.061 --> 20:27.813
- You have to tell them.
- Tell them what?

20:27.897 --> 20:31.812
- We're not gonna make the movie.
- Dave, I made them a promise.

20:32.152 --> 20:35.106
How will you make the movie
with Kit Ramsey? He said no.

20:35.197 --> 20:37.688
You don't think I worked that out?

20:37.867 --> 20:40.702
We'll make the movie
with Kit Ramsey, except...

20:40.828 --> 20:43.580
- Except what?
- Except he won't know he's in it.

20:45.625 --> 20:46.704
What?

20:47.419 --> 20:49.625
We secretly follow him around
with a camera.

20:49.713 --> 20:52.085
Our actors walk up to him
and say their lines.

20:52.174 --> 20:54.844
And he's in our movie,
and we don't have to pay him.

20:54.927 --> 20:58.877
- What's he gonna say?
- What difference does it make?

20:58.973 --> 21:01.678
It's an action movie.
All he's gotta do is run.

21:01.768 --> 21:04.972
He runs away from the aliens,
he runs toward the aliens.

21:05.063 --> 21:07.021
I want to show you something.

21:08.359 --> 21:10.767
Got this all worked out, I think.

21:12.780 --> 21:15.532
There are six major scenes with Kit.
The ones in red.

21:15.617 --> 21:17.444
He's not in any of the other scenes...

21:17.536 --> 21:20.656
...so we just shoot those
with our own actors on our own time.

21:20.747 --> 21:23.036
Bingo, we've got a movie.

21:23.584 --> 21:24.782
That's crazy.

21:26.128 --> 21:27.920
But we're desperate.

21:28.297 --> 21:31.797
Why don't you wait till you get a star
who wants to be in it?

21:31.968 --> 21:33.760
I'm 49 years old.

21:34.012 --> 21:38.307
Admittedly, I could get away
with 44, 41, maybe 38.

21:38.642 --> 21:41.181
But when you hit 50,
they don't hire you anymore.

21:41.270 --> 21:43.429
It's like they can smell 50.

21:43.564 --> 21:44.940
What's that?

21:47.569 --> 21:49.977
When I was 10,
I knew I wanted to make movies...

21:50.072 --> 21:52.397
...but I knew no one
was going to give me that.

21:52.491 --> 21:55.991
So I started putting away
one dollar every week of my life.

21:56.203 --> 21:59.787
If I missed a week, I made it up later,
from age 10 on.

22:00.625 --> 22:04.623
And now, you're looking at enough
to get us started.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.754
$2,184.

22:08.592 --> 22:11.000
But movies cost millions of dollars
to make.

22:11.095 --> 22:14.595
That's after gross net deduction
profit percentage...

22:14.974 --> 22:17.513
...deferment ten percent of the nut.

22:17.936 --> 22:20.688
Cash? Every movie costs $2,184.

22:41.253 --> 22:43.542
Where do I go to be an actress?

23:19.588 --> 23:21.746
Okay. That was nice.

23:21.840 --> 23:24.545
We have your photos,
and we'll call you when we decide.

23:24.635 --> 23:27.043
- I have new photos.
- No, these are good.

23:27.471 --> 23:30.508
- You hated me, didn't you?
- No. You were very good.

23:35.814 --> 23:37.308
She was good.

23:37.983 --> 23:40.818
She had the personality
of a zip code in Kansas.

23:41.237 --> 23:44.357
- She didn't have "it."
- What do you mean, "it"?

23:45.658 --> 23:47.402
"Lt" is a special quality.

23:47.744 --> 23:51.030
No matter what,
you cannot take your eyes off that person.

23:51.248 --> 23:54.866
Every word they say,
every gesture you're interested in.

23:55.461 --> 23:56.741
Do I have "it"?

23:58.172 --> 24:00.545
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. What?

24:02.802 --> 24:04.083
Do I have "it"?

24:06.598 --> 24:07.974
Yes, you do.

24:09.476 --> 24:11.054
I thought I did.

24:12.480 --> 24:14.140
Next. Who's next?

24:14.690 --> 24:16.600
Is this where I go to be a star?

24:16.693 --> 24:20.773
This is where you go to sacrifice,
learn your craft and work hard.

24:20.947 --> 24:24.198
Does that take more than a week?
I gave myself one week.

24:24.368 --> 24:29.363
- That's this office.
- We'll take a chance, see if you have "it."

24:29.707 --> 24:31.830
See if you have a special quality.

24:31.918 --> 24:34.670
See if you have the illusion
of the first time.

24:36.298 --> 24:38.504
Where do I pay? It's $25, right?

24:38.842 --> 24:40.716
- A check?
- I have ID.

24:41.595 --> 24:45.807
Maybe a less solid movie company
could take a check, but we only take cash.

24:47.644 --> 24:49.683
But I don't have any cash on me.

24:49.771 --> 24:53.520
I have cash, but just not on me,
and the banks aren't open.

24:53.609 --> 24:55.352
There, there, there.

24:55.945 --> 24:58.946
There's the door.
We can't let you audition.

24:59.365 --> 25:02.200
- But I drove in from Ohio and...
- I'm sorry.

25:02.285 --> 25:03.945
- Well...
- I'm sorry.

25:04.287 --> 25:06.114
There you are. Goodbye.

25:07.040 --> 25:09.958
She looked pretty good, like she could act.

25:10.127 --> 25:13.496
Yeah, but if they don't pay to audition,
it could be dangerous.

25:13.589 --> 25:14.538
How?

25:14.632 --> 25:17.302
If she gets the part.
She might want to be paid.

25:17.385 --> 25:18.666
Maybe she had "it"!

25:18.762 --> 25:21.597
I didn't make the system.
The system is bigger...

25:24.810 --> 25:27.681
All right. If you want
the responsibility, fine.

25:35.530 --> 25:39.149
I talked it over with the man.
Says he'll take a check.

25:39.409 --> 25:40.987
- He will?
- Yes.

25:42.538 --> 25:44.531
- He listens to you?
- Yeah.

25:49.462 --> 25:51.502
"I could never be with you, Todd.

25:51.590 --> 25:54.295
"I'm loyal to Keith. I'm loyal to him.

25:54.551 --> 25:57.553
"I could never, never kiss you."

26:46.234 --> 26:49.401
Okay, that was very good.
Let's try it one more time.

26:49.529 --> 26:52.067
Slater, this time without the erection.

26:53.492 --> 26:56.030
Thank you, Mr. Bowfinger! Thank you!

27:01.793 --> 27:05.541
We gotta get a crew.
The best damn crew we can afford.

27:07.507 --> 27:09.215
<i>Ándale, muchachos!</i>

27:13.013 --> 27:14.674
In here. In here.

27:15.933 --> 27:17.760
Come on. In here.

27:19.145 --> 27:20.889
Welcome to America.

27:32.535 --> 27:35.406
I'm so happy to meet you.
This is gonna be great.

27:35.622 --> 27:38.327
I can tell you know what you're doing...

27:43.339 --> 27:46.008
Thanks for making the trip.
Glad to have you aboard.

27:46.092 --> 27:48.500
Guess what? We just closed Kit's deal.

27:49.178 --> 27:52.014
Typical deal. Points. Name over the title.

27:52.182 --> 27:54.673
- We get only one take with Kit.
- One take?

27:54.768 --> 27:57.259
- He doesn't want to see the camera.
- How come?

27:57.354 --> 27:58.683
It's his way of working.

27:58.772 --> 28:02.901
He's so into his character, that if he sees
the camera, it breaks his concentration.

28:02.985 --> 28:06.818
- When do we start?
- We start tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.

28:16.250 --> 28:17.579
What is it?

28:18.169 --> 28:20.209
I wish you could see what I see.

28:20.296 --> 28:22.123
What do you see, Boss?

28:23.425 --> 28:27.340
The most promising group of young
professionals I've ever worked with.

28:39.943 --> 28:42.517
- Hey, Cliff.
- 'Morning, Dave.

28:58.881 --> 29:00.126
- Good camera.
- Yeah.

29:00.216 --> 29:02.339
It goes back each night or it's a felony.

29:02.426 --> 29:05.297
- Years you'd get.
- You'd get. Daisy, come on.

29:05.471 --> 29:09.007
What if Daisy said, "It's a tough world"
instead of "rough world"?

29:09.100 --> 29:11.093
That's good. Got that briefcase?

29:11.186 --> 29:13.309
She'd bring his briefcase
if she was worried?

29:13.397 --> 29:16.184
The briefcase is a metaphor
for the relationship.

29:16.525 --> 29:20.476
Shouldn't I be in this scene?
I could be lurking behind a bush.

29:38.842 --> 29:41.333
Okay, this is it. Places, everyone.

29:42.596 --> 29:44.423
Roll! Speed! Marker!

29:46.726 --> 29:49.431
Remember, don't let him see the camera.

29:51.648 --> 29:52.893
Action.

29:58.238 --> 29:59.697
Come on, Daisy, go.

30:03.536 --> 30:04.864
Back to Daisy.

30:05.204 --> 30:07.530
Keith, you forgot your briefcase!

30:07.624 --> 30:10.459
Keith, you forgot... You're upset!

30:10.627 --> 30:14.625
One slip-up in your tough,
crime-filled world and you could die.

30:15.382 --> 30:17.174
Keith! Keith!

30:21.014 --> 30:23.968
- Your name Keith?
- No, I'm Jimmy.

30:24.309 --> 30:26.183
But thanks for asking.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.149
And, cut!

30:33.402 --> 30:35.276
We got our first shot.

30:40.952 --> 30:42.363
Here it comes.

30:45.916 --> 30:47.956
Come on. Work, baby, work.

30:59.264 --> 31:01.886
<i>Keith, you forgot your briefcase.</i>

31:02.059 --> 31:04.633
<i>You forgot... You're upset.</i>

31:04.729 --> 31:08.727
<i>One slip-up in your tough,
crime-filled world and you could die.</i>

31:09.275 --> 31:12.063
It worked. It looked like Daisy
came out of the house.

31:12.154 --> 31:13.862
This movie's gonna work!

31:22.582 --> 31:25.500
- Dave, did you wash my car?
- Workin' on it.

31:27.713 --> 31:29.255
One scene down.

31:33.427 --> 31:35.919
<i>- Yeah?
- Bowfinger, here's what I got.</i>

31:36.013 --> 31:39.347
Kit and his agent will be
at the Rodeo Grille tomorrow at 12:45 p.m.

31:39.434 --> 31:40.845
Are we gonna be there?

31:40.936 --> 31:43.178
Better believe it. You're a genius.

32:01.208 --> 32:02.868
Can you see over there?

32:02.960 --> 32:05.498
- What do you see? Can you see Kit?
- Yeah.

32:06.464 --> 32:08.373
Am I trying for you or not trying?

32:08.466 --> 32:10.839
You're trying,
but I want at least the same...

32:12.262 --> 32:15.429
I know I ain't gonna be treated like
Mighty Whitey in this town.

32:19.604 --> 32:23.055
I put in 25 years in the theater
before coming to Hollywood.

32:25.318 --> 32:26.694
We're almost ready.

32:26.778 --> 32:30.444
I still don't see why I can't meet the man
I'm going to be working with.

32:30.532 --> 32:34.780
He wants to impress you with his acting,
and he needs his total concentration.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.495
- That's just young!
- I know.

32:36.581 --> 32:39.784
I wish once I could work with someone
who had honed their craft.

32:39.876 --> 32:43.577
- But right now we need that scene.
- You'll get your scene.

32:44.172 --> 32:46.878
He may not be a professional, but I am.

32:47.218 --> 32:48.416
Carol.

33:01.817 --> 33:04.106
White boys get all the Oscars. It's a fact.

33:04.195 --> 33:06.603
- We know that, but...
- Did I get a nomination?

33:06.697 --> 33:10.067
No. 'Cause I ain't played none
of them slave roles.

33:10.160 --> 33:11.702
That's when you get nominated.

33:11.786 --> 33:14.112
Black dude plays a slave role,
gets nominated.

33:14.206 --> 33:16.697
White boy plays an idiot, gets the Oscar.

33:16.792 --> 33:20.161
Find me a script as a retarded slave,
then I get the Oscar.

33:21.255 --> 33:23.925
I'm gonna schmooze. I'll be right back.

33:24.300 --> 33:26.044
Go find that script.

33:26.803 --> 33:28.463
<i>Buck, the Wonder Slave.</i>

33:28.555 --> 33:29.931
Here we go.

33:37.273 --> 33:38.436
Sound.

33:42.529 --> 33:43.692
Lights!

34:01.216 --> 34:02.461
Roll it.

34:06.097 --> 34:09.632
When you left Phoenix, it wasn't
because you wanted to raise soybeans.

34:09.726 --> 34:11.849
You had to get away. Why?

34:12.062 --> 34:15.348
Was it because you wanted me
and it burned inside of you?

34:15.482 --> 34:17.605
- I beg your pardon?
- Come back to Phoenix.

34:17.693 --> 34:21.940
Stop this madness. Let me in on whatever
mission this is that you're doing.

34:22.031 --> 34:23.905
<i>- Do you know who I am?
- Of course.</i>

34:23.992 --> 34:27.324
<i>You're Keith Kincaid.
You've come down from Wyoming...</i>

34:27.495 --> 34:29.453
...with your damn UFOs.

34:29.581 --> 34:31.408
You bastard! Bastard!

34:33.085 --> 34:37.083
- Because you prefer alien love!
- Alien love?

34:37.507 --> 34:40.922
- Why did you say "alien love"?
- I must get my umbrella.

34:41.094 --> 34:42.837
You triggered the voices.

34:45.891 --> 34:47.089
Freddy!

34:50.771 --> 34:53.097
Take me to Terry Stricter! Now!

34:57.570 --> 34:58.816
We got it.

34:58.905 --> 35:01.361
Strange people are coming
to me on the street...

35:01.450 --> 35:04.985
...and they're speaking in Jupiterian
or Venutian or something.

35:05.079 --> 35:08.246
Strangers come up to you,
and you don't understand them.

35:08.332 --> 35:10.491
- What is that?
- Maybe they're fans.

35:10.960 --> 35:13.286
- Crazy fans.
- They speak to me...

35:13.380 --> 35:16.749
...only they speak in a secret
white language that I can't decode.

35:16.842 --> 35:18.467
It's horrifying!

35:18.677 --> 35:23.174
What do these crazy people
who speak to you and make no sense say?

35:23.599 --> 35:26.885
They talk about things I never heard of,
about people I don't know.

35:26.978 --> 35:30.597
Somebody named Keith.
And aliens, sex and umbrellas.

35:32.568 --> 35:33.730
I see.

35:34.570 --> 35:35.685
Kit?

35:38.324 --> 35:40.696
Do you think you can keep it together?

35:42.036 --> 35:43.614
Yes, I can keep it together.

35:43.705 --> 35:47.489
I'm K-l-T, Kit. I'm keeping it together now.

35:47.668 --> 35:50.669
Keep it together. I'm keeping it together.

35:50.796 --> 35:54.794
- Don't I look together?
- Have you heard any more voices?

35:56.344 --> 35:57.375
No.

36:01.600 --> 36:05.349
Every now and then I hear a voice.
I haven't heard voices.

36:06.564 --> 36:08.687
What did this one voice say?

36:14.781 --> 36:17.189
"As I stand here before you today...

36:17.701 --> 36:20.275
"...the Laker Girls' cheerleading squad...

36:20.371 --> 36:22.909
"...needs to be taken down a peg or two."

36:29.214 --> 36:32.417
You know, last night was really special.

36:33.051 --> 36:36.136
It was. I've never done it
lying down before.

36:37.640 --> 36:39.716
- You know, next time...
- Yeah?

36:40.226 --> 36:43.927
Next time, I think I'd like to do it
with just two condoms.

36:44.272 --> 36:46.645
If I was in the movie more, yeah.

36:47.776 --> 36:52.439
If I was in the movie more,
we'd be equals, and I'd trust you more.

36:52.531 --> 36:55.319
- We have lots of scenes together.
- I love our scenes.

36:55.410 --> 36:59.408
Our scenes are the best,
but I should have more scenes with Kit.

36:59.497 --> 37:03.875
If I had more scenes with Kit,
then that would really pump up our scenes.

37:05.087 --> 37:09.299
Afrim would be in charge of that.
He's the screenwriter.

37:10.843 --> 37:13.679
- So the writer's in charge of that?
- Yeah.

37:21.605 --> 37:24.179
- Boss, I've got those pages.
- What pages?

37:24.275 --> 37:26.268
The new pages.

37:26.945 --> 37:29.352
I think if Daisy had more scenes with Kit...

37:29.447 --> 37:32.199
...it would pump up the scenes with Slater.

37:32.451 --> 37:36.319
So I wrote more scenes for Daisy and Kit,
some hot scenes...

37:36.664 --> 37:39.867
...where there's heat and chemistry.

37:40.042 --> 37:42.534
- I don't think we need...
- I think you will see...

37:42.629 --> 37:46.709
...these new hot scenes, the ones
in which Daisy exposes her breasts...

37:46.800 --> 37:48.959
...will increase sales in Thailand.

37:49.470 --> 37:50.798
Daisy agreed to this?

37:50.888 --> 37:53.426
That is the case,
although I haven't talked to her.

37:53.516 --> 37:55.010
- Baby.
- Hi.

37:58.646 --> 37:59.809
Hello.

38:00.732 --> 38:03.223
"A vixen in stretch pants.

38:03.694 --> 38:06.481
"What man wouldn't want a hot virgin?"

38:08.866 --> 38:09.862
You'll do this?

38:09.951 --> 38:13.071
If I have to. If it's for the movie,
and you really want me to.

38:13.163 --> 38:16.366
If it's artistic and says something
about reality...

38:16.458 --> 38:18.996
If it's in character and for the scene...

38:19.461 --> 38:20.872
Right, right.

38:22.006 --> 38:25.340
Bowfinger International Pictures.
How may I direct your call? What?

38:25.426 --> 38:29.211
I tracked Kit to MindHead.
He could be coming down any time.

38:34.394 --> 38:35.972
All right, all right.

38:36.063 --> 38:38.685
Kit feels he's ready to shoot
the parking lot scene.

38:38.774 --> 38:41.266
I just love the way this guy works.

40:34.361 --> 40:36.899
Keep it together. Keep it together.

40:38.657 --> 40:40.068
Keep it together.

41:00.056 --> 41:01.432
And, cut!

41:02.475 --> 41:04.801
- Did you get that?
- Nice.

41:05.020 --> 41:07.725
- What'd you see?
- Fear. Mostly fear.

41:07.815 --> 41:10.650
- Some insane looks.
- You saw insane looks?

41:11.152 --> 41:13.608
Betsy, you were such a good girl.

41:15.490 --> 41:19.405
Let's get Carol out of her trailer,
shoot the other side of this masterpiece.

41:38.599 --> 41:40.508
- He's brilliant.
- He is.

41:41.769 --> 41:45.269
His fear is so real.
It's like it's actually happening.

41:58.246 --> 42:01.947
- We work really well together.
- That's what he was saying.

42:08.716 --> 42:10.590
<i>Bastard!</i>

42:12.511 --> 42:13.757
Darling.

42:17.600 --> 42:20.352
Darling, I respect Kit's way of working.

42:20.479 --> 42:22.970
The no rehearsal, no contact off screen.

42:23.065 --> 42:27.526
But it's so traditional to actually meet
the person you're working with.

42:27.653 --> 42:31.486
No, you should not meet Kit because
we're not doing anything traditional here.

42:31.574 --> 42:35.442
We're working in a new style.
We're working in cinema nouveau.

42:37.164 --> 42:38.706
Cinema nouveau.

42:45.340 --> 42:47.961
It felt so good today to quit my job.

42:48.677 --> 42:51.250
I told them, "I'm a screenwriter now."

42:51.555 --> 42:54.224
They said,
"You have eight brothers and four sisters.

42:54.308 --> 42:58.140
"How will you earn your money?"
I said, "This is more important.

42:58.437 --> 43:03.230
"Bowfinger has given me a chance,
and I'm going to take it."

43:03.902 --> 43:06.227
You are a great writer. You really are.

43:06.321 --> 43:10.022
I love my new scenes. They're so great.
Are they going in?

43:10.159 --> 43:13.077
- That's up to Bowfinger.
- It is?

43:34.519 --> 43:36.975
That's sharp. Do the thing.

43:39.066 --> 43:41.557
I'm gonna look good in that. That's bad.

43:41.652 --> 43:43.941
Send it up to the house for me.

43:44.155 --> 43:47.856
The store would be happy to offer you
these clothes without charge...

43:47.951 --> 43:50.656
...if you'd come back Friday,
let us take a picture...

43:50.745 --> 43:53.830
<i>...for LA Style of you wearing the clothes.</i>

43:54.249 --> 43:57.701
I can do that. It'll cost you $1,000.
I'll be here Friday, 4:00.

43:57.795 --> 44:00.630
- I'm sure that could be arranged.
- Hundred-dollar bills.

44:00.715 --> 44:01.878
Right.

44:03.510 --> 44:06.179
I know I shouldn't do this,
I just want you to know...

44:06.263 --> 44:09.466
...that you were so real
in your response to the aliens.

44:09.558 --> 44:12.595
I wasn't even sure
I could be a pod person...

44:12.770 --> 44:16.720
...but now I'm enjoying it
because you made the aliens come alive.

44:16.816 --> 44:19.188
It was like they were living inside of me.

44:19.277 --> 44:21.947
At first I was nervous
about us having sex...

44:22.072 --> 44:25.856
...but now I think it's fine as long
as we do it in a professional manner.

44:25.951 --> 44:27.991
There'll be a lot of people watching.

44:28.079 --> 44:30.202
I won't bother you anymore.

44:42.636 --> 44:44.345
He's in the grotto.

44:48.393 --> 44:50.801
What did this alien want from you?

44:51.480 --> 44:53.519
She wanted to inhale my gonads!

44:53.732 --> 44:56.306
- Say again?
- My gonads!

44:56.485 --> 44:59.985
They come down, pretend they're shaking
your hands, but they're not.

45:00.072 --> 45:03.074
They inhale your gonads
for special research.

45:03.576 --> 45:05.368
I got rid of the Sports Channel.

45:05.453 --> 45:08.573
No more gamma beams from Jupiter
messing with my mind.

45:09.249 --> 45:10.660
Keep it together.

45:10.876 --> 45:14.957
Kit, maybe you should stay
with us for a few days...

45:15.339 --> 45:19.254
...in our special celebrity relaxing quarters.

45:20.637 --> 45:23.175
- You think I need that?
- I do.

45:25.350 --> 45:26.928
Go get my checkbook.

45:28.979 --> 45:30.390
Keep it together.

45:34.319 --> 45:37.024
- Can't find Kit.
- What do you mean you can't find Kit?

45:37.113 --> 45:40.862
He's one of the most famous faces
in the world. You can find him.

45:40.993 --> 45:44.943
No. We staked out his house,
MindHead, everywhere.

45:45.122 --> 45:47.530
- He's vanished, gone.
- Where is the guy?

45:47.667 --> 45:51.712
We can't shoot movie without our star.
Actors have no work ethic these days.

45:51.796 --> 45:54.667
They keep his movements secret.
They control him.

45:54.758 --> 45:58.507
A lot of guys must look like Kit.
We'll get a look-alike for the long shots.

45:58.596 --> 46:01.087
We'll shoot him from behind
and not show his face.

46:01.182 --> 46:03.507
Kit showed his ass
in eight of his ten films...

46:03.601 --> 46:07.302
...eight of his ten films were hits,
so we need a guy with a fabulous ass...

46:07.397 --> 46:09.473
...and mine is the wrong color.

46:17.158 --> 46:20.159
Then I studied at the Moscow Arts Theater
for two years...

46:20.245 --> 46:22.617
...and did a year at the National in London.

46:22.706 --> 46:27.249
<i>I'm currently doing a midnight production
of Waiting for Godot here in L.A.</i>

46:27.711 --> 46:29.621
And are you in the union?

46:29.839 --> 46:31.167
Yes, I am.

46:35.178 --> 46:38.797
Currently, I'm packing fries
at the Burger King on Douglas.

46:38.932 --> 46:42.467
- Do you have experience in film?
- Quite a bit, actually.

46:42.645 --> 46:47.521
Quite a bit of experience.
I'm an active renter at Blockbuster...

46:47.900 --> 46:51.104
...and I attend the Film du Cinema...

46:51.237 --> 46:53.526
...as much as possible.

46:53.740 --> 46:58.070
Weekly, biweekly, inter-weekly,
intermediately.

46:58.829 --> 47:01.202
Would you be willing to cut your hair?

47:03.918 --> 47:07.334
Yes, but it's usually better
if someone else does it.

47:11.093 --> 47:13.086
I've had a few accidents.

47:16.641 --> 47:20.508
- Can you see without your glasses?
- Yeah. I can see.

47:22.439 --> 47:25.144
I don't really see well, but I can see.

47:26.151 --> 47:28.773
- Do you have contacts?
- I have contact lenses.

47:28.862 --> 47:31.614
I can wear contact lenses. That'd help.

47:32.325 --> 47:34.994
- Can I put my glasses back on?
- Sure, put them back on.

47:35.078 --> 47:37.035
I'm getting a little headache.

47:37.706 --> 47:41.157
Would you be willing to show
your naked rear end in a movie?

47:50.720 --> 47:52.380
Yeah, I guess so.

47:58.896 --> 48:02.941
- This is hard.
- Just one more question.

48:03.568 --> 48:08.195
In addition to being a star in this film,
would you also be willing to run errands?

48:09.699 --> 48:12.654
I'm really hoping
to get a career running errands.

48:12.745 --> 48:14.784
That'd be a major boost for me.

48:20.003 --> 48:22.494
- What did you say your name was?
- Jiffrenson.

48:22.589 --> 48:25.590
- Jiffrenson?
- Jiff. My friends call me Jiff.

48:25.717 --> 48:27.959
Jiff, welcome aboard.

48:28.429 --> 48:30.220
Here's your wardrobe.

48:31.265 --> 48:33.887
All right! All right.

48:34.102 --> 48:36.723
Awesome. Awesome.

48:37.731 --> 48:39.059
All right.

48:47.158 --> 48:49.731
- How do you feel?
- I feel kind of strange.

48:49.952 --> 48:52.360
- You look good. You look tough.
- I do?

48:52.455 --> 48:54.662
Like an action star.

48:55.709 --> 48:58.544
Shoulders out. Take a good, deep breath.

48:59.129 --> 49:00.505
Suck it in.

49:02.216 --> 49:05.751
In this scene, you're hurting inside.
You're not sure who to trust.

49:05.845 --> 49:08.799
You want to run into the arms
of your beloved.

49:10.225 --> 49:12.597
- Hi, I'm Daisy.
- Hi. How are you?

49:13.228 --> 49:17.061
When I yell "action," you are gonna run
from point "A" over there...

49:18.818 --> 49:20.692
...to point "B" over here.

49:22.030 --> 49:23.773
That seems kind of hard.

49:23.865 --> 49:26.356
Think of it as an errand.

49:26.743 --> 49:30.195
Your errand is to run across
the freeway until I yell, "Cut."

49:31.749 --> 49:35.201
I get it. But doesn't that seem
a little dangerous?

49:35.628 --> 49:38.380
No. We have professional stuntmen
doing the driving.

49:38.465 --> 49:40.256
You'll be completely safe.

49:40.509 --> 49:44.376
Professional stuntmen.
That's how they do it! I was wondering.

49:44.805 --> 49:47.676
- Stunt drivers.
- Okay, you ready to do one?

49:48.309 --> 49:50.634
Sure. They're going really fast!

50:02.616 --> 50:04.111
Action!

50:06.913 --> 50:08.407
Come on, Jiff!

50:09.416 --> 50:10.578
Action!

50:18.384 --> 50:21.551
Keith! I love you!

50:33.526 --> 50:34.724
Action!

51:04.518 --> 51:05.550
Cut!

51:09.566 --> 51:11.772
Heavenly Father! Heavenly Father!

51:11.860 --> 51:15.229
That was so great! You were fantastic!
Wasn't he great?

51:15.489 --> 51:17.814
Congratulations! That was so good!

51:17.908 --> 51:20.364
- I don't want to do this anymore.
- What?

51:20.453 --> 51:23.620
I just want to run errands. Heavenly God!

51:23.957 --> 51:28.121
Not many people can do what you just did.
The stunt drivers were really impressed.

51:28.211 --> 51:30.335
- Weren't they?
- Really?

51:30.422 --> 51:33.459
- We got an errand we want you to do.
- Really?

51:33.676 --> 51:37.888
We want you to go to Starbucks.
Get coffee for everybody.

51:37.972 --> 51:41.342
- I would love to go get coffee.
- You're the only one who can do it.

51:41.434 --> 51:43.474
I want to get the coffee now.

51:43.562 --> 51:45.970
But first, let's do this one more time.

51:46.357 --> 51:47.815
Heavenly God!

51:53.072 --> 51:54.401
Good work.

51:56.159 --> 51:59.077
Mr. Bowfinger, Bob,
can I talk to you about the new scenes?

51:59.162 --> 52:01.832
- I haven't decided yet.
- Can I talk to you about them?

52:01.915 --> 52:03.493
- Okay.
- I mean tonight?

52:07.964 --> 52:09.079
Okay.

52:55.350 --> 52:57.093
I'll be right there.

53:32.307 --> 53:35.225
Gets so tiring going out.
I thought we'd eat here.

53:35.352 --> 53:38.686
- I know the maitre d' at the lvy.
- That's so trendy.

53:38.773 --> 53:42.723
- Do you like Vienna sausages?
- Yeah. Do you smell burning hair?

53:48.325 --> 53:52.110
This wine is so good. You can drink
all you want and not get drunk.

53:52.288 --> 53:53.533
Yeah.

53:54.707 --> 53:58.159
A big local hit in South Dakota.
What are your favorite TV shows?

53:58.253 --> 54:01.753
<i>- I love The Flintstones.
- I love The Flintstones too! That's so good.</i>

54:01.840 --> 54:04.841
- Do you like walks in the park?
- In the rain!

54:05.177 --> 54:07.799
<i>I want you to see The Music Man because...</i>

54:07.930 --> 54:10.504
<i>- I love The Music Man.
- Isn't Robert Preston good?</i>

54:10.600 --> 54:13.008
He's so good.
Do you love Smashing Pumpkins?

54:13.103 --> 54:16.602
I love to do that.
Have you ever had a shiatsu massage?

54:24.198 --> 54:26.606
- I love you so much!
- I love you!

54:26.826 --> 54:29.993
- I'm so alive!
- I've never been alive until now.

54:30.622 --> 54:31.903
Never till now.

54:35.085 --> 54:36.995
But I worry about our age difference.

54:37.088 --> 54:40.753
- What is age? It's a state of mind.
- That's the way I feel.

54:40.842 --> 54:43.333
Who cares if when I hit my sexual peak
you'll be 70?

54:43.428 --> 54:45.635
I know! It's Bogey and Bacall.

54:45.973 --> 54:47.052
Who?

54:48.767 --> 54:53.015
I promise to never play mind games
with your head.

54:53.105 --> 54:54.730
You are so today.

54:55.316 --> 54:57.558
- I want to make love to you!
- I do too!

54:57.652 --> 55:00.060
- I want you so much!
- I want you!

55:01.198 --> 55:04.199
- But I worry.
- Our love is bigger than worry.

55:04.493 --> 55:06.450
- I worry about the scenes.
- The scenes?

55:06.537 --> 55:08.613
If we're gonna shoot the new scenes.

55:08.706 --> 55:11.494
It's so hard to make love,
to give yourself to a man.

55:11.584 --> 55:14.289
It's the woman who's entered,
the woman who's violated.

55:14.379 --> 55:15.755
I so understand that.

55:15.839 --> 55:18.330
To know that the man inside you
is part of you...

55:18.425 --> 55:22.174
...and that he would not prevent
the added scenes of yours from being shot.

55:22.263 --> 55:23.971
- We're doing the scenes.
- We are?

55:24.056 --> 55:25.255
We're doing them 'cause...

55:25.350 --> 55:29.395
...you're brilliant. I want you in this movie,
and this movie is your movie.

55:29.479 --> 55:31.472
Let me just go get ready.

55:49.501 --> 55:51.245
I love you.

56:03.100 --> 56:04.808
I'll never use you.

56:05.603 --> 56:07.809
I will never abuse your trust.

56:13.236 --> 56:14.814
Thank you, Daisy.

56:14.905 --> 56:16.778
Not at all, not at all.

56:33.091 --> 56:35.049
Are we almost ready?

56:35.135 --> 56:37.045
Are you seeing the fireplace?

56:37.555 --> 56:39.797
We should light the fireplace.

56:40.183 --> 56:41.926
Is this a good mark?

56:45.856 --> 56:48.347
Daisy, my sweetness.

56:48.817 --> 56:50.395
Hi, how are you?

56:52.404 --> 56:54.148
- Hi.
- Are you okay?

56:54.323 --> 56:56.779
- Do you want to relax first or shoot?
- Shoot.

56:56.868 --> 56:59.822
You have such a good work ethic.
I so admire that.

57:00.163 --> 57:03.449
Here's your mark, it's a little small.
Will you be okay...

57:03.542 --> 57:04.573
All right, yeah.

57:04.668 --> 57:06.328
We have a very important scene.

57:06.420 --> 57:10.086
This is one of the hot scenes
that is about heat and...

57:13.470 --> 57:14.750
...chemistry.

57:15.263 --> 57:17.386
So it's the artistic portion of the film.

57:17.474 --> 57:21.686
Right, so give her a little room,
react normally, be sensitive above all...

57:21.812 --> 57:25.181
...because in this scene
Daisy's gonna take off her blouse.

57:28.486 --> 57:30.111
All right. There's your mark.

57:30.196 --> 57:32.818
The scene is, you're not sure
if you still love Keith...

57:32.908 --> 57:35.862
...but you offer yourself to him
in order to save the planet.

57:35.953 --> 57:38.907
Right up here. We're starting here.

57:39.123 --> 57:41.793
Pan up. And roll sound.

57:41.876 --> 57:44.581
- All right, let's go.
- Speed.

57:46.131 --> 57:48.622
- Mark.
- You're not sure if you love him...

57:48.717 --> 57:51.802
...but you want to save the planet,
and, action.

57:52.763 --> 57:55.551
Keith, I don't know what's right anymore.

57:55.808 --> 57:59.142
All I know is I have feelings
that make me need you.

57:59.479 --> 58:00.938
Need you now!

58:13.369 --> 58:14.614
Awesome!

58:18.208 --> 58:19.916
You're doing great!

58:22.588 --> 58:24.462
You're gonna be a star.

58:25.091 --> 58:26.466
And, cut.

58:36.019 --> 58:37.644
How's this, Boss?

58:53.706 --> 58:55.699
What's going on with him?

58:56.417 --> 58:59.786
The alien arrival scene is next
and Kit hasn't called in.

58:59.879 --> 59:01.956
Someone must know where he is.

59:02.299 --> 59:05.750
I know where Kit Ramsey's going
to be this afternoon.

59:08.597 --> 59:09.593
You do?

59:09.765 --> 59:13.633
At 4:00 he's going to be
at Max's clothing store for a photo.

59:20.903 --> 59:24.189
Every day I get an offer on this thing.
It's the only one in L.A.

59:24.281 --> 59:27.117
- It's a beauty.
- Not a scratch. An award-winner.

59:27.201 --> 59:30.784
- Sold three cars to get this.
- You have a great eye for cars.

59:30.872 --> 59:34.491
My wife tried to take it in the divorce.
That would have really hurt.

59:34.584 --> 59:36.791
- Who got the kids?
- She did.

59:57.568 --> 59:59.276
Wait here a minute.

01:00:12.043 --> 01:00:14.499
- Manager in?
- No, he's home today.

01:00:15.004 --> 01:00:17.756
That's odd. We have a permit
to shoot here today.

01:00:17.841 --> 01:00:20.676
Weird. We'll just start loading
in the equipment.

01:00:20.761 --> 01:00:24.759
- You want me to call him?
- No, I'll call him from the cell phone.

01:00:31.773 --> 01:00:35.818
There's a guy in there who's vacuuming.
Tell him you're from the studio.

01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:46.491
- Who's in charge here?
- I am.

01:00:46.956 --> 01:00:49.993
- Do you have a permit to film here today?
- Yeah.

01:00:50.085 --> 01:00:51.663
May I see it, please?

01:00:53.088 --> 01:00:56.789
Can I talk to you for a second?
Did you ever think about acting?

01:01:20.494 --> 01:01:22.949
- This is it. Roll it.
- Mark!

01:01:29.170 --> 01:01:30.201
Action!

01:01:43.102 --> 01:01:45.937
That time away really helped calm my ass.

01:01:46.105 --> 01:01:48.478
Thought I was startin' to crack up.

01:01:48.566 --> 01:01:51.105
You ever think, there are no conspiracies?

01:01:51.194 --> 01:01:54.445
Maybe there's no aliens.
Everything's just as it seems.

01:01:54.615 --> 01:01:57.236
Being alone, by myself, in a chamber...

01:01:58.744 --> 01:02:00.369
<i>That was really helpful to me.</i>

01:02:00.455 --> 01:02:02.697
Freddy? Where the hell... Freddy?

01:02:04.167 --> 01:02:05.875
- Freddy!
- Hey, you!

01:02:06.837 --> 01:02:09.293
- Kincaid!
- Freddy!

01:02:11.008 --> 01:02:14.045
- You heard me, Kincaid!
- Freddy, don't play with me.

01:02:14.136 --> 01:02:15.797
Nice try, Kincaid.

01:02:16.347 --> 01:02:18.969
Don't act dumb. Where's the plutonium?

01:02:20.227 --> 01:02:24.439
That plutonium is mine. It's registered
to be used for religious purposes.

01:02:24.815 --> 01:02:26.689
You actually have some plutonium?

01:02:26.775 --> 01:02:28.151
He has plutonium?

01:02:28.235 --> 01:02:29.481
Don't play around.

01:02:29.570 --> 01:02:33.189
Freddy's about to have his guts replaced
with alien hardware.

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:36.949
- Aliens?
- They told me you were dead!

01:02:37.037 --> 01:02:38.994
And now you are dead!

01:02:44.378 --> 01:02:48.211
Keith, whenever you kill a pod person,
another one takes its place!

01:02:48.341 --> 01:02:51.627
- You won't take me in your spaceship!
- I love you!

01:02:51.803 --> 01:02:53.428
Keith! Keith!

01:02:56.016 --> 01:02:57.261
I love you!

01:02:57.476 --> 01:02:59.019
Stay with him!

01:03:03.608 --> 01:03:07.227
I came down because I wanted
to see them shoot you today.

01:03:07.446 --> 01:03:08.988
Shoot me today?

01:03:09.156 --> 01:03:11.196
My darling! Please, Keith!

01:03:11.617 --> 01:03:14.239
Let me love you! My darling baby!

01:03:14.412 --> 01:03:15.871
Come with me!

01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:23.248
He's coming! Stay with him.

01:03:30.638 --> 01:03:31.669
Keith!

01:03:32.724 --> 01:03:34.467
He's coming in here!

01:03:39.439 --> 01:03:40.471
Cut!

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:45.184
Lyle, you might have won an Emmy,
but that doesn't mean anything here.

01:03:45.279 --> 01:03:48.316
I need to see the moment
where you realize he loves you.

01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:51.611
He's embroidering for you.
Doesn't that affect you in your heart?

01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:53.660
- Doesn't that make you...
- Kit Ramsey!

01:03:53.747 --> 01:03:55.740
Over here. I got the car running.

01:03:55.833 --> 01:03:57.991
- Freddy, show me your guts!
- What?

01:03:58.169 --> 01:04:00.624
Show me your guts right now!

01:04:01.923 --> 01:04:03.797
Pod people are all over the place!

01:04:03.883 --> 01:04:05.426
Pod people?

01:04:06.469 --> 01:04:08.795
Come on. We're gonna shoot scene 35!

01:04:10.224 --> 01:04:11.718
Keith!

01:04:12.852 --> 01:04:15.473
Who the hell is Keith? Open the door!

01:04:16.314 --> 01:04:17.476
Keith!

01:04:23.196 --> 01:04:24.607
Go, go, Freddy!

01:04:27.284 --> 01:04:28.316
Cut!

01:04:31.456 --> 01:04:32.914
I must say...

01:04:32.999 --> 01:04:36.867
...I am becoming more and more
impressed with Mr. Ramsey's acting style.

01:04:36.962 --> 01:04:38.504
I'm learning a lot from him.

01:04:38.588 --> 01:04:41.839
- I haven't done much of anything.
- What are you talking about?

01:04:41.925 --> 01:04:44.084
You look like Kit Ramsey. That's talent.

01:04:44.178 --> 01:04:46.385
Not everybody could look like Kit Ramsey.

01:04:46.472 --> 01:04:48.714
Robert DeNiro
could not look like Kit Ramsey.

01:04:48.808 --> 01:04:50.433
He annoys me anyway.

01:04:50.518 --> 01:04:53.057
If I go to the store to get some coffee...

01:04:53.146 --> 01:04:56.017
...I know that I'm the one
who'll get the coffee.

01:04:56.275 --> 01:04:58.351
I'm the one that got the coffee.

01:04:58.527 --> 01:05:01.482
I made sure the napkin was in the bag.

01:05:01.656 --> 01:05:04.740
I made sure there was cream,
there was sugar in the bag.

01:05:04.826 --> 01:05:07.448
I did it. Me! You know?

01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:11.955
It's weird for...
To get credit for lookin' like somebody.

01:05:12.626 --> 01:05:14.915
- What is that?
- That's a gift!

01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:19.248
I don't know how much of a gift it is.
I am his brother.

01:05:22.345 --> 01:05:24.919
That's what's so great
about working with you guys.

01:05:25.015 --> 01:05:28.550
Whenever someone finds out
I'm related to Kit Ramsey...

01:05:28.644 --> 01:05:32.060
...they want me to introduce them to him,
and I can understand that.

01:05:32.148 --> 01:05:36.360
But it feels good to have somebody
like you for you.

01:05:36.444 --> 01:05:38.437
It's great. I feel great.

01:05:42.618 --> 01:05:44.860
- You get along with your brother?
- Yeah.

01:05:44.954 --> 01:05:47.706
We haven't seen him in a while.
He's been so busy.

01:05:47.790 --> 01:05:49.830
He's crankin' them out, back-to-back.

01:05:49.918 --> 01:05:52.872
He didn't even come home
for last Christmas.

01:05:53.547 --> 01:05:56.418
- I'm sorry, darling.
- That's okay.

01:05:57.092 --> 01:06:01.387
I'm here with this fantastic group of people
who accept me for who I am.

01:06:01.472 --> 01:06:05.256
Just the poor, stupid brother of someone
who everybody loves.

01:06:12.651 --> 01:06:14.858
So, are you from a show-business family?

01:06:14.945 --> 01:06:16.060
We're screwed.

01:06:16.155 --> 01:06:19.904
We luck into the brother
of the world's hottest movie star...

01:06:20.201 --> 01:06:23.119
...but I have a conscience.
- Don't be so hard on yourself.

01:06:23.205 --> 01:06:24.948
You hear him? He's an innocent.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.365
He told us how much he loved us.

01:06:27.626 --> 01:06:29.334
I just can't do it.

01:06:30.296 --> 01:06:33.499
I gotta take the camera back.
You'll work it out.

01:06:34.467 --> 01:06:36.009
I can't do it.

01:06:36.928 --> 01:06:39.929
<i>What I like is Citizen Kane.
Very good movie.</i>

01:06:41.141 --> 01:06:43.300
<i>What's good is Apocalypse Now.</i>

01:06:43.394 --> 01:06:46.311
<i>Godfather. Dr. Strangelove.</i>

01:06:47.064 --> 01:06:49.734
<i>- Stanley Kubrick.
- A Clockwork Orange.</i>

01:06:49.817 --> 01:06:51.312
Mr. Bowfinger.

01:06:51.861 --> 01:06:54.779
Mr. Bowfinger, I got something to tell you.

01:06:54.906 --> 01:06:57.232
I have something to tell you.
Come over here.

01:06:57.326 --> 01:06:59.817
- Can I talk first?
- All right, all right.

01:07:00.496 --> 01:07:03.166
Being Kit Ramsey's brother...

01:07:03.249 --> 01:07:06.167
...sometimes it has its fringe benefits.

01:07:06.669 --> 01:07:08.294
How do you mean?

01:07:09.965 --> 01:07:13.583
You'll never guess
who I had intercourse with in the van.

01:07:22.103 --> 01:07:23.977
Isn't that cool?

01:07:26.066 --> 01:07:29.649
She gave me the works.
She is the most inventive girl.

01:07:29.778 --> 01:07:33.362
- Can I see you in my office?
- Yeah, sure. She's so strong.

01:07:33.533 --> 01:07:36.487
She's pure power and speed. Real hot.

01:07:38.538 --> 01:07:40.495
I got an errand for you.

01:07:41.249 --> 01:07:45.034
Go to Starbucks,
and I want you to get some coffee.

01:07:45.129 --> 01:07:47.252
Go to Starbucks and get some coffee.

01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:50.175
- You're gonna need napkins for everybody.
- I got that.

01:07:50.259 --> 01:07:53.593
Call your brother,
find out where he's going today.

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:55.803
Find out where Kit's going.

01:07:55.891 --> 01:07:59.640
- Then pick up pencils from store...
- Pencils from the store.

01:07:59.728 --> 01:08:01.353
Then sharpen the pencils.

01:08:01.439 --> 01:08:03.312
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

01:08:03.441 --> 01:08:07.439
Coffee, napkins, stationery,
find out where my brother's going.

01:08:08.071 --> 01:08:10.906
- Ride like the wind.
- I'm gone, man! Gone!

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.778
I want to see you.

01:08:20.001 --> 01:08:22.243
- We are finished. We are over.
- How come?

01:08:22.337 --> 01:08:24.163
- You had sex with Jiff.
- So?

01:08:25.006 --> 01:08:27.961
- Never thought of it that way.
- I'll see you tonight at 8:00?

01:08:28.051 --> 01:08:28.917
Okay.

01:09:12.559 --> 01:09:15.133
There's someone who thinks
he should talk to you.

01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:17.518
He says it concerns Kit Ramsey.

01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:29.488
This is Bob, a Level Six.
He's been with us for four years.

01:09:29.828 --> 01:09:32.497
There's something he wants to tell you.

01:09:36.711 --> 01:09:39.961
- Jack, just taking her out for a wash.
- Okay.

01:09:55.857 --> 01:09:59.523
We still have this one last scene,
the big ending or we don't have a movie.

01:09:59.611 --> 01:10:02.648
- I know what else we don't have.
- What?

01:10:03.991 --> 01:10:05.320
Permission.

01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:09.493
Did you know Tom Cruise had no idea...

01:10:09.581 --> 01:10:12.665
...he was in that vampire movie
till two years later?

01:10:13.502 --> 01:10:14.581
Hello?

01:10:15.546 --> 01:10:16.791
Hi, Jiff.

01:10:19.842 --> 01:10:23.461
He's leaving his house at 4:45
to go to MindHead. Great work.

01:10:23.596 --> 01:10:26.716
Now, we really need those pencils, buddy.

01:10:27.893 --> 01:10:30.016
I will see you at the location.

01:10:30.354 --> 01:10:32.975
We are about to shoot
the final scene in this movie.

01:10:33.065 --> 01:10:35.224
I just talked with Kit. He is very excited.

01:10:35.318 --> 01:10:37.773
So know your jobs. Don't screw up.
Let's go.

01:10:37.862 --> 01:10:39.938
We have one hour to get there.

01:10:40.198 --> 01:10:43.733
Make sure Slater has finished painting
that car! Let's go!

01:10:44.119 --> 01:10:46.657
- Can I talk to you about the scene?
- Sure.

01:10:47.706 --> 01:10:49.284
This is a hard scene for Kit.

01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:51.997
He probably won't want
to get in that car with you.

01:10:52.086 --> 01:10:54.756
He'll probably really resist
because of his character.

01:10:54.839 --> 01:10:56.797
So you have to be very persuasive...

01:10:56.883 --> 01:10:59.719
Because he doesn't know
he's in the movie.

01:11:01.221 --> 01:11:05.220
I know what's going on.
I may be from Ohio, but I'm not from Ohio.

01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:08.974
I'm not mad.

01:11:09.063 --> 01:11:11.436
- I'm working, aren't I?
- But...

01:11:13.485 --> 01:11:14.944
Who told you?

01:11:15.279 --> 01:11:16.987
We're packed and loaded.

01:11:17.114 --> 01:11:18.229
Hi, honey.

01:11:18.449 --> 01:11:22.317
Hi, sweetie. Will you make sure
my makeup case is in the van?

01:11:27.375 --> 01:11:28.870
Let's hit it!

01:12:29.236 --> 01:12:31.359
Anybody want a Frostee Freeze?

01:12:31.488 --> 01:12:34.110
I look like I want
some damn Frostee Freeze?

01:12:43.418 --> 01:12:45.078
Holy shit!

01:12:47.214 --> 01:12:49.123
- Reverse it!
- I got it.

01:12:51.135 --> 01:12:52.333
Hold on!

01:12:54.222 --> 01:12:55.467
What the hell?

01:13:01.855 --> 01:13:03.515
It's the dead guy!

01:13:17.456 --> 01:13:19.579
Please don't let me die!

01:13:28.677 --> 01:13:30.254
This is awesome!

01:13:54.247 --> 01:13:55.871
It's going down!

01:13:56.457 --> 01:13:59.328
Right now, it's going down.
I'm so glad you're here.

01:13:59.419 --> 01:14:02.207
- I'm Kit Ramsey!
- That's Kit Ramsey.

01:14:02.297 --> 01:14:04.290
You know who I am, right?

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:07.126
Please, one at a time. I can't hear you.

01:14:07.219 --> 01:14:10.589
<i>I'm Number 13 on Premiere's power list.
What are you doin'?</i>

01:14:10.890 --> 01:14:14.675
Tough guys like you
don't get far in this world.

01:14:14.811 --> 01:14:17.433
We've been getting pursued
by alien forces!

01:14:17.731 --> 01:14:18.929
Aliens!

01:14:39.922 --> 01:14:45.083
I should never have slept with the alien
life form from the star system Neon!

01:14:54.605 --> 01:14:55.886
Shit!

01:15:00.028 --> 01:15:01.902
My gonads! My gonads!

01:15:03.407 --> 01:15:06.776
Keith, there's only one way out of this.
Follow me!

01:15:09.455 --> 01:15:10.997
Kiss you? Now?

01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:14.373
Danger really turns you on!

01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:18.172
Get in the car.

01:15:18.465 --> 01:15:21.502
We must get to the alien antenna
before the summer solstice!

01:15:21.594 --> 01:15:24.299
You best hurry! I'm Keith.

01:15:59.052 --> 01:16:01.045
That way, Carol. This way.

01:16:07.019 --> 01:16:10.353
Bill, we're here! Put the tripod there.
All right, ready?

01:16:10.857 --> 01:16:13.430
We gotta eat.
How we could know if we're starving?

01:16:13.526 --> 01:16:17.145
I needed love, love so strong,
but the alien embryos had already...

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:18.781
Hit the lights!

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:22.906
Action.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:25.992
Get out!

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:29.959
There's the alien antenna.

01:16:30.045 --> 01:16:32.666
That's where you must go to say,
"Gotcha, suckers!"

01:16:32.756 --> 01:16:35.426
If you don't, we will all become pod people.

01:16:36.093 --> 01:16:38.133
Cut! Let's move the camera.

01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:42.053
They will impregnate everyone,
including the CIA and the FBI!

01:16:43.101 --> 01:16:46.102
Soon as you're set,
start rolling on the stairwell.

01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:48.225
In here!

01:16:53.696 --> 01:16:56.863
They're all aliens worshipping
their false gods.

01:17:01.288 --> 01:17:03.411
- Come on! Come on!
- No! No!

01:17:04.333 --> 01:17:06.705
<i>Keep running since you're
with the one person...</i>

01:17:06.794 --> 01:17:08.122
I got them.

01:17:10.798 --> 01:17:11.498
Shit!

01:17:11.591 --> 01:17:13.334
Cut to the stairwell.

01:17:13.426 --> 01:17:16.878
<i>Then I realized it was you
that I loved and...</i>

01:17:18.056 --> 01:17:20.014
The roof is your next shot.

01:17:21.643 --> 01:17:23.304
Bastard! Bastard!

01:17:23.938 --> 01:17:26.346
- No, no, I'm Keith!
- Bastard!

01:17:32.072 --> 01:17:33.186
<i>Stop it!</i>

01:17:34.449 --> 01:17:35.564
Stop it!

01:17:45.837 --> 01:17:47.082
Shit!

01:17:48.715 --> 01:17:50.874
She was from the planet Neon!

01:17:51.385 --> 01:17:53.508
Don't bring that shit over here!

01:17:53.721 --> 01:17:54.717
<i>Put that down!</i>

01:17:54.805 --> 01:17:56.679
Cut! Okay, outside.

01:17:57.725 --> 01:17:59.268
Drop that shit!

01:18:02.522 --> 01:18:06.651
We must run. We have only 40 seconds!

01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:16.115
This is it. We only need one shot.

01:18:25.131 --> 01:18:27.538
Only one thing can stop them now.

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:30.374
- Lf you say, "Gotcha, suckers!"
- What?

01:18:31.221 --> 01:18:33.427
- Put your hands right here.
- What?

01:18:33.515 --> 01:18:35.508
Go! Cue the pyrotechnics.

01:18:38.395 --> 01:18:39.427
Shit!

01:18:39.522 --> 01:18:41.349
My God! It's time!

01:18:42.733 --> 01:18:45.307
Look into the sky and say,
"Gotcha, suckers!"

01:18:45.403 --> 01:18:46.648
Kincaid!

01:18:53.662 --> 01:18:55.205
Gotcha, suckers!

01:18:56.332 --> 01:18:57.910
Come on, say it.

01:19:01.087 --> 01:19:02.665
Come on, say it!

01:19:47.472 --> 01:19:52.549
It seems the paranoid
are sometimes actually being followed.

01:19:53.145 --> 01:19:55.434
This film is only for Madagascar and Iran...

01:19:55.523 --> 01:19:58.477
...neither of which
accept American copyright law.

01:19:58.651 --> 01:20:01.771
Terry! I'm Keith Kincaid.

01:20:02.489 --> 01:20:04.565
I saved the world.

01:20:05.993 --> 01:20:07.368
I saved it.

01:20:22.719 --> 01:20:27.429
I have eight brothers, four sisters,
and no job! I'm screwed!

01:20:27.516 --> 01:20:30.387
There's no movie!
I can't believe there's no movie!

01:20:30.478 --> 01:20:32.720
I didn't look for work,
I thought I was working.

01:20:32.814 --> 01:20:36.397
- I showed my breasts on film. For what?
- I'm a felon.

01:20:36.735 --> 01:20:39.487
My friends, I have a cousin who's a lawyer.

01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:43.280
I say we take action. We sue. Sue! Sue!

01:20:43.826 --> 01:20:45.819
Carol, what do you think?

01:20:49.082 --> 01:20:50.327
I think...

01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:54.958
I think it was a beautiful lie.

01:21:18.823 --> 01:21:20.567
It could've worked.

01:21:27.166 --> 01:21:29.574
Boss, what you want me to do
with this stuff?

01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:31.329
- What is it?
- It's the film.

01:21:31.421 --> 01:21:34.292
I told him to follow Kit around
and get some random shots.

01:21:34.382 --> 01:21:36.671
You never know. We could've used it.

01:21:36.843 --> 01:21:38.124
The trash is outside.

01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:41.007
- I wanna take a look at it.
- Why hurt ourselves?

01:21:41.098 --> 01:21:43.174
We need Kit Ramsey's permission.

01:21:43.267 --> 01:21:46.352
Why didn't someone bring that up
to me at some point?

01:21:47.522 --> 01:21:49.515
<i>Hold up, hold up.</i>

01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:58.031
Useless. A tennis-playing alien fighter.

01:22:04.541 --> 01:22:05.952
Nice work, guys.

01:22:06.084 --> 01:22:09.085
Thank you, Mr. Bowfinger.
We used a Pro-Mist...

01:22:09.171 --> 01:22:13.216
...and tried to open up the aperture
to give him a rim light.

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:21.724
What's he doing?

01:22:34.324 --> 01:22:36.897
I think we just got our permission.

01:22:54.847 --> 01:22:56.507
<i>Hey, Laker Girls.</i>

01:23:03.273 --> 01:23:04.815
<i>It's not funny!</i>

01:23:17.956 --> 01:23:22.665
You realize all courts in the country
would consider this blackmail!

01:23:25.923 --> 01:23:30.087
I don't know anything about blackmail.
I'm just a guy with a great film.

01:23:30.177 --> 01:23:32.633
I need a shot of Kit saying,
"Gotcha, suckers"...

01:23:32.722 --> 01:23:34.347
...and a couple of close-ups.

01:23:34.432 --> 01:23:38.644
Or we'll use a shot of Kit wagging his thing
at the Laker Girls.

01:23:38.854 --> 01:23:41.226
Which is a great ending.

01:23:41.315 --> 01:23:43.687
Though not such a good ending for Kit.

01:23:43.776 --> 01:23:46.314
It could sort of stop his money flow...

01:23:46.404 --> 01:23:51.031
...and possibly make that family film
he's about to do, just...

01:23:56.290 --> 01:23:58.496
We'll have to think about it.

01:24:00.461 --> 01:24:04.411
We'll have to think about it, for Kit.

01:24:09.221 --> 01:24:11.794
Now that you've had time
to think about it...

01:24:11.890 --> 01:24:15.758
...what do you and the other fellows
here at MindFu... Head think?

01:24:53.228 --> 01:24:54.853
Good to see you.

01:24:57.983 --> 01:24:59.526
This way.

01:25:19.298 --> 01:25:21.422
Not bad seats at all!

01:25:41.532 --> 01:25:44.402
<i>CIA operative, Todd Delmonico...</i>

01:25:44.535 --> 01:25:48.153
<i>... drove his '53 Buick to meet Keith Kincaid.</i>

01:25:49.624 --> 01:25:51.118
<i>Kincaid!</i>

01:25:51.459 --> 01:25:53.582
<i>It had rained that day.</i>

01:25:53.795 --> 01:25:57.295
<i>But was it normal rain?
Or was it Chubby Rain?</i>

01:25:57.591 --> 01:26:00.213
<i>- Freddy?
- You heard me there, Kincaid.</i>

01:26:00.970 --> 01:26:02.168
<i>Freddy?</i>

01:26:05.850 --> 01:26:09.718
<i>Freddy's about to have his guts replaced
with alien hardware!</i>

01:26:32.421 --> 01:26:33.916
<i>Gotcha, suckers!</i>

01:26:51.943 --> 01:26:54.399
A hit. A hit.

01:27:17.722 --> 01:27:19.216
Hey, you guys!

01:27:20.224 --> 01:27:22.348
I want you to meet somebody.

01:27:22.894 --> 01:27:25.468
This is Farrah.
Farrah and I met at the premiere.

01:27:25.564 --> 01:27:28.767
Farrah's one of the most powerful lesbians
in Hollywood.

01:27:29.276 --> 01:27:30.439
Bravo!

01:27:40.247 --> 01:27:42.489
I can't talk to you right now.

01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:58.907
It's an offer to direct a movie in Taiwan
starring Kit Ramsey's brother.

01:28:59.001 --> 01:29:01.077
Oh, my God! Are you serious?

01:29:03.214 --> 01:29:05.088
We're goin' to Taiwan!

01:30:10.663 --> 01:30:12.039
Jiff! Jiff!

01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:31.139
Good to see you again, brother.

01:35:58.591 --> 01:36:00.667
