¶¶

00:03.604 --> 00:06.271
(theme song playing)

00:08.442 --> 00:11.477
<i> ¶ I got the wind in my hair</i>
<i> and a fire within ¶</i>

00:11.479 --> 00:14.213
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's</i>
<i> something beginning ¶</i>

00:14.215 --> 00:18.517
<i> ¶ I got a mystery to solve</i>
<i> and excitement to spare ¶</i>

00:19.487 --> 00:22.621
<i> ¶ That beautiful breeze</i>
<i> blowing through ¶</i>

00:22.623 --> 00:27.226
<i> ¶ I'm ready to follow it</i>
<i> who knows where ¶</i>

00:27.228 --> 00:30.362
<i>¶ And I'll get there, I swear ¶</i>

00:30.364 --> 00:34.466
<i> ¶ With the wind in my hair ¶</i>

00:45.212 --> 00:47.479
Narrator:
<i> Centuries ago,</i>
<i> Corona was engaged</i>

00:47.481 --> 00:52.284
<i> in a years-long war with</i>
<i> its rival kingdom, Saporia.</i>

00:53.354 --> 00:54.486
<i> Corona's then-king,</i>

00:54.488 --> 00:56.255
<i> Herz Der Sonne,</i>

00:56.257 --> 00:58.357
<i> created a complex system</i>
<i> of tunnels to move</i>

00:58.359 --> 01:01.493
<i> his knights and supplies</i>
<i> wherever he needed.</i>

01:01.495 --> 01:03.495
<i> He then made a detailed map</i>

01:03.497 --> 01:05.364
<i> of these tunnels</i>
<i> and their secrets</i>

01:05.366 --> 01:07.366
<i> in a secure journal.</i>

01:07.368 --> 01:08.667
<i> At the height of the war,</i>

01:08.669 --> 01:12.237
<i> Der Sonne's sworn enemy,</i>
<i> General Shampanier,</i>

01:12.239 --> 01:15.641
<i> launched a full-scale invasion</i>
<i> on Corona.</i>

01:22.416 --> 01:24.216
<i> Shampanier fought her way</i>

01:24.218 --> 01:25.584
<i> through the castle to face</i>

01:25.586 --> 01:27.553
<i> King Herz Der Sonne himself.</i>

01:27.555 --> 01:32.558
<i> Their battle waged for hours</i>
<i> with neither side relenting.</i>

01:32.560 --> 01:37.429
<i> That is, until Shampanier</i>
<i> discovered that the book's</i>
<i> final pages contained</i>

01:37.431 --> 01:40.532
<i> Herz's profession</i>
<i> of love for her.</i>

01:40.534 --> 01:42.367
<i> It was then</i>
<i> she realized</i>

01:42.369 --> 01:46.438
<i> she held similar feelings</i>
<i> for him as well.</i>

01:46.440 --> 01:49.374
<i>And soon, the two were married.</i>

01:49.376 --> 01:51.710
(cheering)

01:51.712 --> 01:53.479
And a lasting piece
was brought

01:53.481 --> 01:55.547
to the newly united nations

01:55.549 --> 01:56.615
forevermore.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.451
(sobbing)
Gets me every time.

01:59.453 --> 02:03.555
Oh! Isn't that
the most romantic story
you've ever heard?

02:03.557 --> 02:07.259
I guess.
If you're into romance
and that kinda thing.

02:07.261 --> 02:11.463
And our kingdom
commemorates this day,
the Day of Hearts,

02:11.465 --> 02:13.665
each year
by displaying the book,

02:13.667 --> 02:15.667
so all those
who have found true love

02:15.669 --> 02:17.703
may sign its pages.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.376
(cheering)

02:26.247 --> 02:28.614
Happy Day of Hearts, my lady.

02:28.616 --> 02:34.553
(growling)
Can't this kingdom go one day
without celebrating something?

02:35.589 --> 02:38.323
I'm a little worried
about Cass.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.359
She's been acting
kind of weird lately.

02:40.361 --> 02:44.429
Probably just the Day of Hearts.
People either love it
or loathe it.

02:44.431 --> 02:48.634
Cass obviously
falls into the latter category
because she hates everything.

02:48.636 --> 02:49.768
Nothing we can do.

02:49.770 --> 02:53.438
Ahh! Or maybe there is.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.311
Ladies lunch!
And I brought cupcakes!

02:59.313 --> 03:03.315
Each one is a single serving,
because there's nothing wrong
with being single,

03:06.520 --> 03:08.103
right, Friedborg?

03:08.104 --> 03:09.687
This is great, Raps,
but I don't have time
right now, okay?

03:09.690 --> 03:11.623
You two have fun, though.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.364
Uh, wait! What is that?

03:19.366 --> 03:21.767
Is something caught up
in my hair?

03:23.504 --> 03:26.805
(gasp)
Now how did that
get in there?

03:28.642 --> 03:30.609
(knocking)

03:31.545 --> 03:33.378
(whistling)

03:33.380 --> 03:36.481
-Will you just stop, Rapunzel?
-(door slamming)

03:36.483 --> 03:39.651
Drastic times
call for drastic measures.

03:43.490 --> 03:44.656
-(sing-song) Cass!
-(Cass gasps)

03:44.658 --> 03:49.394
Look what I got for you.
I know you are gonna
love this.

03:49.396 --> 03:52.764
I painted Eugene's face
on your sparring dummy
like you always wanted!

03:52.766 --> 03:56.401
I mean, it kinda felt horrible
doing it, but I'm sure
he won't mind.

03:56.403 --> 03:59.538
You know if we...
don't tell him, obviously,
please don't tell him.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.573
Thanks.
You're sweet.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.843
(as Eugene)
Come on, Cassandra.
Look at my adorable,

04:04.845 --> 04:07.512
well-chiseled face.
Don't you just wanna
hit it?

04:07.514 --> 04:10.382
Look, Raps, I get
what you're doing,
and I appreciate it,

04:10.384 --> 04:12.784
-but I'm fine.
-Cass, no.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.854
Something is clearly wrong.
You never wanna hang out,

04:15.856 --> 04:19.691
you keep disappearing.
You don't even wanna
beat up Eugene.

04:19.693 --> 04:22.628
I'm dealing with...
uh, some stuff.

04:22.630 --> 04:25.564
Stuff I'm not ready
to share, but when
I am ready,

04:25.566 --> 04:27.432
you'll be the first person
I go to.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.634
Trust me.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.802
Okay.
I trust you.

04:41.749 --> 04:45.584
So, we've just gotta let Cass
come to us when she's ready

04:45.586 --> 04:48.453
-to share what's going on.
-(squeaking)

04:50.557 --> 04:52.557
Rapunzel:
(gasp) That's Cass!

04:52.559 --> 04:54.459
What is she up to?

04:54.461 --> 04:56.461
-Maybe we should find out.
-(squeaks)

04:56.463 --> 04:59.798
Not to be nosy,
just to make sure she's okay.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.677
Ah-ohh!

05:12.613 --> 05:13.679
Huh?

05:26.627 --> 05:28.593
Oh. There you are.

05:28.595 --> 05:30.829
I couldn't resist
the invitation.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.534
So that's what's going on!

05:35.536 --> 05:37.602
Cass is in love!

05:37.604 --> 05:38.670
(squeaking)

05:38.672 --> 05:39.838
Whoa-whoa!

05:39.840 --> 05:41.773
(splash)

05:41.775 --> 05:43.909
(coughing)

05:45.946 --> 05:48.880
Cass?
And friend of Cass?

05:50.718 --> 05:52.684
No introduction?
Okay. Yeah, that's fine.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.686
Oh, I-- I'm sorry.
I'm Andrew.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.689
You must be cold.
Please, take my jacket.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.792
Thank you.
Ooh, nice and warm.

06:00.794 --> 06:05.731
I made it myself.
It was shorn from the fleece
of<i> poquito</i> Juan Pablo,

06:05.733 --> 06:07.833
a blind orphan
mountain sheep I rescued

06:07.835 --> 06:09.701
from a pack
of ravenous wolves.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.870
I gave him a home,
he gave me warmth.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.840
I often ask myself,
who rescued whom?

06:14.842 --> 06:16.875
Wow!
This guy is smooth.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.478
Actually, Rapunzel
was just leaving.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.912
Oh! Right. Yes, of course!

06:20.914 --> 06:24.549
It's-- It's getting
late and... I have
to rest my muscles

06:24.551 --> 06:26.585
after a swim like that,
wouldn't wanna cramp up.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.588
-Rapunzel!
-Right, right, sorry.
Good night!

06:29.590 --> 06:31.656
-Whoa!
-(splash)

06:32.860 --> 06:35.994
Rapunzel:
(gasp) Someone left crates
all over the dock.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.996
Sorry about that.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.931
Well, she seemed nice.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.946
Wow.
Cassandra actually
found a boyfriend.

06:54.948 --> 06:59.684
He is so hand--
Hands-- His, um--

06:59.686 --> 07:03.522
They aren't proportional
to the rest of his body,
gross, uchh, not attractive.

07:03.524 --> 07:06.108
You think he's handsome?

07:06.109 --> 07:08.693
His eyebrows
are clearly asymmetrical,
and you call that facial hair?

07:08.695 --> 07:10.962
-Come on.
-How great would it be
if the four of us

07:10.964 --> 07:14.900
became best friends
and did couple-y things
all the time together?

07:14.902 --> 07:18.603
Uh, great isn't the first word
that comes to mind.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.605
Honestly.
Stomach-churning.
That does.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.642
The only problem
is I think Cass is kinda shy

07:23.644 --> 07:26.795
when it comes
to admirers.

07:26.796 --> 07:29.947
Cassandra may be
a lotta things, and I mean,
(laughs) a lot of things,

07:29.950 --> 07:32.717
but shy ain't one of 'em.
You're better off letting her
handle this

07:32.719 --> 07:33.952
however she sees best.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.588
I agree with you,
to a point.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.590
And to which point
would that be?

07:38.592 --> 07:40.659
-A double date?
-Yes!

07:40.661 --> 07:42.828
They're four-person
fun machines!

07:42.830 --> 07:45.664
-(cabinet doors opening)
-Rapunzel, I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

07:45.666 --> 07:48.934
I really, really do,
but I-- I'm not at a place
where I wanna go public.

07:48.936 --> 07:54.673
Which is why
I've come up with an itinerary
of private activities for us.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.577
(sigh)

07:58.579 --> 08:00.812
But we really aren't
that serious yet.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.080
Uh, no problem.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.915
We'll keep it short
and sweet, then.

08:10.657 --> 08:16.061
(mandolin music playing)

08:18.966 --> 08:20.832
(finishes playing, croaks)

08:20.834 --> 08:23.702
So, Andrew, I couldn't
help but notice you're
goin' steady

08:23.704 --> 08:26.771
-with our Cassandra.
-W-- We're not going steady.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.707
But, you are interested, right?

08:28.709 --> 08:31.710
I-- I just wanna be clear,
because you strike me
as a guy who really

08:31.712 --> 08:33.845
has his game together.
I mean, you're smart,

08:33.847 --> 08:36.815
attractive,
not the most attractive man
in the room, clearly--

08:36.817 --> 08:40.785
-Eugene!
-What? Cass knows
I'm kidding, right?

08:40.787 --> 08:42.687
No, seriously, though,
is she blackmailing you?

08:42.689 --> 08:44.789
Blink three times
if the answer is yes.

08:44.791 --> 08:49.127
-Ah-yeee!
-So, Andrew, tell us everything.
How did you and Cass meet?

08:49.129 --> 08:51.796
Well, see,
I'm somewhat bibliophilic.

08:51.798 --> 08:54.866
Bibliophilic?
Oh, I am so sorry,
but don't you worry, Andrew.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.736
Corona has the best
medical professionals
in the world.

08:57.738 --> 09:01.840
(chuckles)
Actually, a bibliophile
is someone who loves books.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.643
Oh, bibliophilic, of course.

09:04.645 --> 09:05.810
I've read about that.

09:05.812 --> 09:07.712
I told you
this was a bad idea.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.014
-(bowl hitting table)
-(squeaking)

09:09.016 --> 09:11.917
I simply had to see
King Herz Der Sonne's book.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.919
As an anthropologist,
as a historian,

09:13.921 --> 09:18.757
and, as a mere
amateur chirographist,
well, it's been my dream.

09:18.759 --> 09:23.862
Anyway, I sent the Captain
of the Guards many letters
requesting an opportunity

09:23.864 --> 09:25.997
to study the book up close.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.733
But my dad asked me
to send a letter
rejecting his request,

09:28.735 --> 09:32.737
for security reasons.
So instead, I invited him
to come see the book

09:32.739 --> 09:34.773
on the Day of Hearts,
when it's available
to the public.

09:34.775 --> 09:38.176
And our letters continued
and well, (chuckles)
Cassie and I

09:38.178 --> 09:40.912
got to know each other,
very well.

09:40.914 --> 09:44.182
(mandolin music playing)

09:44.184 --> 09:46.751
That is so cute!

09:46.753 --> 09:49.854
Yeah, our Cassie
is quite the catch.

09:49.856 --> 09:52.958
You know, she's
the most skilled fighter
for miles around.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.025
(kicks table)

09:54.027 --> 09:55.860
(laughs)
Oh-- R-- Really?

09:55.862 --> 09:58.897
A-- (chuckling)
And on that note,

09:58.899 --> 10:00.098
I think we should
call it a night.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.200
Andrew has to fly home
in the morning.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.802
Rapunzel/Eugene: Fly?

10:04.871 --> 10:07.172
(birds crying)

10:10.777 --> 10:13.361
Andrew:
Ballooning
is one of my passions.

10:13.362 --> 10:15.946
What better way
to see nature's gifts
than from a bird's perspective?

10:15.949 --> 10:19.784
Besides, I don't condone
modes of transportation
that exploit animals.

10:19.786 --> 10:20.986
Woo-hoo!

10:20.988 --> 10:24.089
(gasp)
It's like being
in a giant lantern!

10:24.091 --> 10:25.924
It's magic!

10:25.926 --> 10:28.893
It's simple science,
actually, but yes,
your Highness,

10:28.895 --> 10:30.829
it can be quite magical.

10:30.831 --> 10:34.065
You wanna make your life
easier, have Cass here
pull those cords for you.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.201
She's got some
serious pythons under there.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.971
Okay, this double date
needs to end, now.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.906
You guys are totally
embarrassing me.

10:41.908 --> 10:44.843
We are?
I'm sorry, we didn't mean to.

10:44.845 --> 10:48.013
It's fine, but can
you two please stop talking
about my muscles

10:48.015 --> 10:51.816
or my fighting skills?
I want Andrew to know
a different side of me.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.785
Oh! Yeah!
Of course.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.754
And as soon
as the balloon
touches down,

10:55.756 --> 10:57.155
I'd like to be alone with him.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.859
But we haven't even gotten
to the tandem horseback
ride y--

11:01.928 --> 11:03.762
Okay. Yeah. Got it.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.832
Cass wants some alone time.

11:07.834 --> 11:11.002
Ahh! Thank goodness!
If I have to spend
one more minute with this guy--

11:11.004 --> 11:12.203
Eugene!
You wanna take us down?

11:12.205 --> 11:14.005
(excited laugh)

11:14.007 --> 11:17.142
Gently twist the valve
counterclockwise to vent
the hot air.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.943
Thanks, ace,
I'll take it from here.

11:22.215 --> 11:25.884
Wow! That necklace
is so beautiful.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.285
May I see?

11:31.124 --> 11:36.961
It's been in my family
for decades, it means,
"Love is true inner wealth."

11:36.963 --> 11:39.097
You said clockwise, right?

11:43.170 --> 11:46.004
(birds cawing)

11:46.005 --> 11:48.839
Don't worry!
Eugene and I will find it.
You guys go finish your date.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.076
Ooh, it was counterclockwise,
wasn't it?

11:51.078 --> 11:52.277
Right.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.919
Ouch!
I feel terrible about this!

12:00.921 --> 12:03.054
Ow!
I know I might've
come on a bit strong,

12:03.056 --> 12:05.256
but I'm really happy
for Cass.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.859
Ow!
I just wish she weren't
so guarded.

12:07.861 --> 12:10.261
Aah!
Look, it's not
all your fault.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.230
I know it's not all
my fault.

12:12.232 --> 12:15.900
You were the one
that turned the valve
the wrong way.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.869
But it's mostly your fault.

12:17.871 --> 12:21.206
-What?
-Okay, I'm the last person
to defend Cassandra,

12:21.208 --> 12:24.109
but not everyone is as open
with their feelings as you are.

12:24.111 --> 12:27.178
Okay?
Cass plays things
closer to her vest.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.848
And if you wanna
be her friend,
which is something

12:29.850 --> 12:32.917
I will never, ever,
ever, ever understand,

12:32.919 --> 12:34.886
you'll have to accept that,
and back off a bit.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.221
-Hmm.
-(Pascal squeaks)

12:36.223 --> 12:38.156
-(squeaking)
-Rapunzel:
The pendant!

12:47.367 --> 12:50.201
And the other half
of the pendant!

12:51.972 --> 12:53.304
You got any gum?

13:02.382 --> 13:04.382
Sorry my friends
have been so intrusive.

13:04.384 --> 13:07.118
And I am really sorry
about your pendant.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.054
Don't worry about it,
Cassie, I-- I'm just glad

13:10.056 --> 13:11.956
that we finally get to be alone.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.191
Me, too.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.978
-(both grunting)
-(thud)

13:37.117 --> 13:39.083
You know how you've
been saying it'd be great

13:39.085 --> 13:41.352
to get a private,
up close look
at the book?

13:42.322 --> 13:45.423
Well, I thought
we might sneak a peek,

13:45.425 --> 13:49.093
and, I don't know,
I saw some other couples
signing it together,

13:49.095 --> 13:51.296
so, if you wanted to...

13:51.298 --> 13:55.266
Cassie.
I-- I thought you'd never ask.

13:55.268 --> 13:58.970
But isn't it
after visiting hours?

13:58.972 --> 14:01.206
Perks of being
a guard's daughter.

14:08.982 --> 14:13.184
Xavier, I can't thank you
enough for getting out of bed
to do this for us.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.121
It's my pleasure.

14:16.122 --> 14:19.057
I'm just surprised
you would want to fix something
like (clears throat) this.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.226
But why?
It's so sweet.

14:21.228 --> 14:24.195
It means,
"Love is true inner wealth."

14:24.197 --> 14:28.066
(chuckles)
Whoever told you that
was lying.

14:28.068 --> 14:32.470
This is the emblem
of the separatists
of Saporia.

14:32.472 --> 14:36.374
-The what, now?
-Centuries ago, after the war

14:36.376 --> 14:39.077
brought Saporia
and Corona together,

14:39.079 --> 14:44.182
there was a small sect
of Saporians who felt betrayed,
and swore revenge

14:44.184 --> 14:45.250
on our kingdom.

14:45.252 --> 14:48.419
Some say their descendants
are still around,

14:48.421 --> 14:53.258
waiting
for the perfect opportunity
to strike back at Corona.

14:55.028 --> 14:58.096
(giggles)
We don't have a lot of time.

14:58.098 --> 15:01.132
Oh, don't worry.
This won't take long.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.437
Cass is gonna be
devastated when she finds out

15:06.439 --> 15:08.106
the truth about Andrew.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.508
Yeah.
The only guy who can mess
with Cass is me.

15:11.511 --> 15:14.012
Okay. We'd better split up.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.281
I'll check the throne room,
you take the courtyard.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.351
It's exactly
as I imagined.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.488
Find the perfect space
for us.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.201
(grunts)

15:37.203 --> 15:40.271
Sorry, sweetie,
but the book stays here.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.107
-But how did you--
-I knew you were a fraud
from day one.

15:43.109 --> 15:46.377
You misspelled "bibliophile"
in your letters, bonehead.

15:46.379 --> 15:49.113
I was only playing you
long enough to see
what your angle was,

15:49.115 --> 15:52.483
and from my angle,
it looks like you've
been shut down, Andrew.

15:52.485 --> 15:56.087
-If that's even
your real name.
-It's-- (sigh) It's Hubert.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.289
-Aah!
-Put these on
and don't say another word.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.491
Cassandra! Watch out!
Andrew is...

16:00.493 --> 16:02.393
Ahh!

16:02.395 --> 16:04.329
not who he says he is.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.500
Cuff yourselves
to the podium.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.105
I'd say see you later,

16:14.107 --> 16:16.407
but there's not gonna
be a later for Corona.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.477
Huh, huh, Stan! Pete!

16:19.479 --> 16:21.179
Have you seen Andrew anywhere?

16:21.181 --> 16:24.415
Have I?
Let me tell you somethin'.
That is one handsome fella.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.185
He sounds so like, worldly.
Which makes him handsome
on the inside.

16:27.187 --> 16:30.154
He is not that handsome, okay?

16:30.156 --> 16:34.325
Did you not notice
his wonky eyebrows
with the-- Oh, never mind!

16:35.261 --> 16:36.294
Cassandra:
(sigh) You know?

16:36.296 --> 16:37.528
After the exposition debacle,

16:37.530 --> 16:39.163
this was my big chance

16:39.165 --> 16:41.466
to prove to my dad
I have what it takes
to be a guard.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.434
But you messed
that all up, Rapunzel!

16:43.436 --> 16:46.371
Well, maybe if you had told me
what you were planning,

16:46.373 --> 16:48.306
I wouldn't have messed it up.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.508
I couldn't count on you
not letting anything slip!

16:50.510 --> 16:53.111
Hey, I can keep things
to myself.

16:53.113 --> 16:56.180
Oh, yeah?
Kinda like when you told Eugene
about the night we snuck out?

16:56.182 --> 16:59.117
-How did you know--
-Or, when you told
about those rocks I showed you?

16:59.119 --> 17:01.519
-I had to. He was gonna--
-And how'd your mom find out

17:01.521 --> 17:03.621
who ate her last
chocolate truffle, hmm?

17:03.623 --> 17:06.290
I turned myself in.
The guilt was just--

17:06.292 --> 17:08.292
Look, Raps,
you're my best friend.

17:08.294 --> 17:11.295
(sigh)
But you're a sharer.
It's in your nature,

17:11.297 --> 17:14.332
and I'm fine with that.
But you'll have to be fine
with respecting things

17:14.334 --> 17:16.167
I wanna keep to myself.

17:16.169 --> 17:19.370
Even if those things
have life-threatening
consequences?

17:19.372 --> 17:21.539
Okay, in my defense,
no one's life

17:21.541 --> 17:23.508
was really threatened
until you showed up.

17:23.510 --> 17:26.177
You're right. Tell you what.
Let's make a deal.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.312
I'll understand
you keeping some things
to yourself,

17:28.314 --> 17:31.315
if you understand
that when something's
bothering you,

17:31.317 --> 17:33.317
I'm gonna wanna help.

17:33.319 --> 17:36.354
You've got my back,
so let me have yours.

17:36.356 --> 17:37.555
I suppose I can live with that.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.490
Rapunzel!

17:39.492 --> 17:43.194
Ahh, I bet we don't think
Andrew's so handsome anymore,

17:43.196 --> 17:44.562
now do we, ladies?

17:44.564 --> 17:47.231
I wouldn't say
he's un-handsome, right?

17:47.233 --> 17:50.601
I mean him being a rebel
doesn't really take away
from the fact--

17:50.603 --> 17:53.571
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me!

17:53.573 --> 17:56.441
Oh, go after the book.
Don't waste time trying
to pick the cuffs,

17:56.443 --> 17:59.210
-they're double-locking,
black steel--
-Got 'em.

17:59.212 --> 18:02.246
Huh. All right. We may just
have a chance to catch him
if we hurry.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.457
Ha-ha!
So long, Corona!

18:12.459 --> 18:16.260
I just realized,
I never gave you
your good night kiss.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.295
(grunts) Aah!

18:17.297 --> 18:19.363
Now, hand over that book.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.365
(breathing heavily)

18:21.367 --> 18:22.533
(grunt)

18:28.408 --> 18:30.608
(grunting)

18:30.610 --> 18:33.277
Oh, that was insanely hard.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.579
(grunting)

18:34.581 --> 18:38.282
Uh, you guys...
who's drivin' this thing?

18:48.628 --> 18:50.528
-Ahh!
-Yaah!

18:53.399 --> 18:55.333
(screams)

18:55.335 --> 18:56.400
(gasps) Ohh!

18:58.471 --> 18:59.604
(squeaks)

18:59.606 --> 19:01.506
I knew you cared after all.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.307
-Well, I don't!
-(smack)

19:03.309 --> 19:04.408
Aah-- Bibliophilic!

19:04.410 --> 19:06.277
-Enough! Give me the book!
-(grunting)

19:06.279 --> 19:07.311
-(smack)
-Ooh!

19:07.313 --> 19:09.580
-Hey!
-Get us down from here!

19:09.582 --> 19:11.616
Now that I can do!

19:11.618 --> 19:13.651
Come on, Pascal!
We're almost there.

19:13.653 --> 19:17.321
Now, was it clockwise
or counterclockwise?

19:17.323 --> 19:18.356
Oooh.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.657
Ahh!

19:20.660 --> 19:22.493
Whoa!

19:22.495 --> 19:24.762
Ohh... the book!

19:27.600 --> 19:28.699
Huh!

19:35.375 --> 19:37.742
-Eugene, grab the book
and get us down.
-Working on it!

19:38.778 --> 19:40.344
Whoa!

19:55.628 --> 19:58.563
Ha! You know, I'm starting
to enjoy this. Aah!

20:03.369 --> 20:05.436
Whoa!

20:07.507 --> 20:09.373
Give me the book, Eugene.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.709
And have Cassandra mad at me?
I think not.

20:11.711 --> 20:15.379
Oh, believe me,
you would much rather
have Cassandra mad at you

20:15.381 --> 20:17.381
than me! Ahh!

20:17.817 --> 20:20.351
Aah! Aahh!

20:20.353 --> 20:21.719
Whoa!

20:21.721 --> 20:23.487
(squeaking)

20:25.525 --> 20:27.425
Gee, a bunch
of butterfingers up there.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.660
-Eugene, the book!
-Yeah, got it!

20:29.662 --> 20:32.496
And I'm fine, too!
Thank you for asking.

20:32.498 --> 20:33.564
Yeee!

20:36.703 --> 20:38.569
Yeah-- No! No!
No, no, no, no!

20:38.571 --> 20:40.738
Huh! Huh...

20:45.678 --> 20:46.844
You know, it's too bad,

20:46.846 --> 20:50.414
I was almost starting
to like you. (grunts)

20:50.416 --> 20:51.482
Pascal!

20:53.519 --> 20:54.785
(squeaks)

20:55.855 --> 20:57.421
Uhh!

20:59.525 --> 21:01.859
(grunting)

21:01.861 --> 21:03.461
(grunts)

21:05.598 --> 21:09.767
Oh, Cassandra.
Saporia will rise again...

21:09.769 --> 21:12.603
and we'll have you
to thank for it.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.639
Eugene:
Cassandra!
You're welcome!

21:14.641 --> 21:16.407
(tearing balloon)

21:16.409 --> 21:18.442
Huh?

21:18.444 --> 21:19.610
(tearing)

21:19.612 --> 21:22.480
-Ugh!
-I wouldn't count
on a second date

21:22.482 --> 21:23.714
if I were you.

21:23.716 --> 21:24.782
(smack)

21:33.760 --> 21:37.461
Here's Corona's hero.
Everyone is talking

21:37.463 --> 21:39.597
about how you saved
Herz De Sonne's book.

21:39.599 --> 21:42.667
Eh, I'm just glad to be back
on my dad's good side.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.575
-(gasp)
-What?

21:51.577 --> 21:53.678
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.513
-I'm proud of you.
-(laughs)

21:55.515 --> 21:56.914
I'm proud of you, too.

22:06.859 --> 22:10.461
(theme music playing)

22:10.463 --> 22:13.431
<i> ¶ Now I got my eyes open</i>
<i> and wide ¶</i>

22:13.433 --> 22:15.666
