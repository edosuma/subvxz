WEBVTT

00:08.548 --> 00:10.178
Ryan ?

00:11.901 --> 00:13.791
Buddy, come on.

00:15.512 --> 00:20.125
Look, I know you're bummed that Lindsay left, but you can't live like this, all right ?

00:22.348 --> 00:26.822
Hey, do you remember when Summer was leaving for Italy with Zach,

00:27.072 --> 00:29.447
you refused to let me stay bedridden and depressed?

00:29.998 --> 00:33.448
No, I didn't. I gave you your space,
said do what you have to do.

00:33.644 --> 00:36.897
True, but right now what I have to do is help you, so

00:37.733 --> 00:41.290
what can I do? Level with me.
Ask and it shall be yours.

00:42.320 --> 00:46.410
- Fine. You leaving, right now.
- Okay, anything but that.

00:48.223 --> 00:51.815
What about Captain Oats?
I've seen the way you look at him.

00:52.028 --> 00:54.571
- You say the word and your pool house is his manger.
- Seth...

00:54.696 --> 00:57.878
Speaking of which, are you getting, like, a little bit sick of the pool house?

00:57.967 --> 01:01.915
Because we can actually switch rooms.
You can have mine; we just thought you'd like the privacy.

01:02.021 --> 01:04.846
I do like the privacy. I would like some right now, actually.

01:04.914 --> 01:08.692
What about a nice private booth at our favorite diner, huh?

01:08.806 --> 01:11.451
Cup of coffee, short stack, little syrup,

01:11.807 --> 01:14.837
- side of bacon...
- Seth, I mean it.
- ...extra crispy like the man likes it.

01:15.099 --> 01:17.675
- Maybe one of those nice little sausage patties.
- Seth, shut up.

01:19.678 --> 01:20.889
Please.

01:24.773 --> 01:27.021
This thing with Lindsay is...

01:27.477 --> 01:28.578
different.

01:30.138 --> 01:35.312
- Different how?
- Different, as in not fixed by pancakes.

01:36.707 --> 01:39.547
- And don't ask me how I feel about waffles
- Got it.

01:43.071 --> 01:45.857
- I don't mean to take this out on you.
- No, it's fine. It's what I'm here for.

01:46.003 --> 01:50.273
I just had a lot of people in my life who just left.

01:52.970 --> 01:57.103
Thought those days were gone,
but guess they aren't.

02:04.397 --> 02:05.749
Okay.

02:07.029 --> 02:09.429
All right, well, I'm just going to leave.

02:09.872 --> 02:13.293
Not leave, but you know what I'm saying.

02:13.827 --> 02:17.471
I can get you something to go... stupid.
Okay.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:27.867 --> 03:30.283
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, honey.

03:37.812 --> 03:39.589
Oh, right, coffee.

03:42.423 --> 03:46.099
- Thanks. Oh, hey! I thought you were...
- No, no, no, no.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.457
BOTH: No, it's my fault. Let me... oh.

03:52.294 --> 03:53.628
Everything's going to be fine.

03:53.878 --> 03:57.933
- Well, if we just act like nothing happened, then it'll just be as if...
- Nothing happened.

04:05.254 --> 04:07.282
Where's your ring?

04:08.176 --> 04:11.371
Two carats, platinum setting, lives on your left hand, second finger.

04:12.025 --> 04:14.240
I can't find it.

04:15.826 --> 04:18.839
- You never take that ring off.
- That's not true.

04:19.058 --> 04:22.271
Sometimes when I'm washing the dishes or gardening, I leave it by the sink.

04:22.416 --> 04:25.537
I bet it fell in. I bet it's stuck in the drain.

04:25.646 --> 04:27.261
I'll call the plumber tomorrow.

04:31.235 --> 04:33.305
I'm sure it's not lost.

04:51.051 --> 04:52.358
Hey.

04:53.175 --> 04:55.027
- Wait a sec.
- But I've been waiting.

04:55.136 --> 04:57.658
Yeah, I know, I'm afraid we have a man down, though.

04:57.803 --> 05:01.107
This thing with Lindsay has just really kicked Ryan's ass.

05:01.307 --> 05:03.576
Which is why it's a good thing we're like the Marines.

05:03.919 --> 05:06.987
- How are we like the Marines?
- We leave no man behind.

05:07.132 --> 05:09.674
Look, Lindsay may have turned her back on Ryan, but we won't, no.

05:09.783 --> 05:11.997
You have got to cheer him up. Semper Fi.

05:12.324 --> 05:14.700
- Oh, Semper Fi, that's so cute.
- Wait.

05:15.027 --> 05:17.405
That has to wait. Plan and action.

05:17.532 --> 05:20.020
I'm going to ask Marissa to the mall later. Maybe you guys can come, too.

05:20.147 --> 05:23.286
The mall, that would cheer him up for sure.

05:23.722 --> 05:27.080
All right, you know what? Fine, I will ask him to the mall. You know what?

05:27.443 --> 05:30.383
Now that you and I are back together and Lindsay's out of the picture,

05:30.731 --> 05:34.308
- who knows, maybe Marissa and Ryan might get it together.
- Are you crazy?

05:34.436 --> 05:37.851
They were, like, the worst couple ever.
And besides, Marissa's happy now.

05:38.048 --> 05:40.522
Ok, and by happy you mean, you mean gay.

05:41.428 --> 05:42.648
That's funny.

05:48.185 --> 05:50.172
Our clothes are all pink.

05:51.321 --> 05:53.749
Pink is the new black. I read it in W.

05:56.966 --> 05:58.802
Separating your whites, who knew?

05:59.127 --> 06:01.659
Everyone who's ever had to do their own laundry.

06:02.031 --> 06:04.180
- I'm sorry. We'll get new stuff.
- With what?

06:04.366 --> 06:06.491
- Have you found an after-school job?
- I'm working on it.

06:11.816 --> 06:14.523
Lucky for you, I look really good in pink

06:15.264 --> 06:18.134
Maybe today we could do something fun.
It's the weekend.

06:18.366 --> 06:20.910
Maybe we could go to the beach or the pier.

06:20.980 --> 06:23.658
That sounds great and I would love to,
but I have to work.

06:26.109 --> 06:29.427
But maybe tonight I could pick up some take-out and we can go sit by the water?

06:30.545 --> 06:32.506
Okay, sounds good.

06:35.890 --> 06:39.243
If a big fat guy with an
"I heart NASCAR" tattoo shows up,

06:39.432 --> 06:43.833
don't answer the door, because he's our landlord and we're late on rent. Bye.

06:51.554 --> 06:54.851
Sanford. Glad to see you finally found your calling.

06:55.984 --> 06:58.816
- Where's Kiki?
- Kirsten's at the office with your wife

06:59.018 --> 07:01.167
They're working on the magazine.

07:01.980 --> 07:05.829
I must tell you I'm really disturbed by Lindsay's departure.

07:06.047 --> 07:08.892
Must you tell me? Isn't there anyone else you could tell?

07:10.693 --> 07:12.741
I lost my daughter.

07:15.126 --> 07:16.680
I'm sorry, Cal.

07:16.840 --> 07:19.004
If you want to talk, I'll listen.

07:19.498 --> 07:21.807
I hate to admit it, but I really screwed up

07:22.328 --> 07:23.955
Hand me the pliers.

07:25.814 --> 07:29.916
- Why can't I edit my own magazine?
- Because you've never edited a magazine

07:30.152 --> 07:35.061
Yeah, but why this guy? He launched a magazine called The Ugly American.

07:35.360 --> 07:39.972
I've heard of that. It's an independent travel magazine. It's won a bunch of awards.

07:41.171 --> 07:44.965
Fine, but our magazine is about beautiful Americans.

07:50.500 --> 07:54.022
She works here, she's, like, the big boss.

07:54.186 --> 07:57.036
Julie, promise me that you will make the best...

08:00.301 --> 08:03.278
Julie Cooper. Or is it Nichol now?

08:03.569 --> 08:06.528
I'm sorry, Mrs. Cooper-Nichol is behind closed doors.

08:06.780 --> 08:09.340
Tell her Lance stopped by looking for her.

08:09.503 --> 08:12.880
She knows me. A little blast from the past.

08:15.855 --> 08:19.377
Julie? Did you hear a word that I just said?

08:19.629 --> 08:24.017
Yeah, of course, um... Yeah, I couldn't have said it better myself.

08:29.848 --> 08:33.515
The girl really got to me.
I worry about her all the time.

08:34.496 --> 08:37.073
How she is, what she's doing.

08:38.198 --> 08:42.945
I was watching a peanut butter commercial on television. I was blubbering like a baby.

08:43.470 --> 08:48.034
Well, there's nothing like a good cry to release the tension. Is the crescent wrench over there?

08:48.208 --> 08:50.986
- What in the devil are you doing anyway?
- Looking for Kirsten's wedding ring.

08:52.002 --> 08:55.123
Oh, Father, I'm glad to see you finally found your calling.

08:55.216 --> 08:58.644
- Exactly what I said.
- Nothing like a good crack about a plumber.

08:59.016 --> 09:01.292
Plumber, crack. That's funny.

09:07.306 --> 09:08.932
Ryan, buddy?

09:10.582 --> 09:12.874
You in the latrine, soldier?

09:46.229 --> 09:47.635
Hey, Summer, it's just you.

09:47.705 --> 09:50.307
I thought you were this big fat guy with an
"I heart NASCAR" tattoo.

09:50.945 --> 09:52.572
Okay, not asking why.

09:55.279 --> 09:58.518
What is that earthy, musky smell, potpourri ?

09:58.659 --> 10:02.934
- No, that's skunked beer.
- Well, hey, it must be awesome to get away from your mom, huh?

10:03.294 --> 10:08.458
- To be out of Caleb's mansion.
- Totally. I don't miss it at all.

10:10.016 --> 10:14.700
So, I'm sure that you have, like, these really cool, edgy plans with Alex today,

10:15.245 --> 10:18.912
but I have to go to the mall for the clothing drive, Battered Women Shelter...

10:19.075 --> 10:22.554
The mall? Sounds great.
Let me just grab my purse.

10:31.721 --> 10:34.335
I hope you brought a lot of snacks.

10:34.535 --> 10:36.840
It's a long ride to Chicago.

10:37.110 --> 10:39.815
- I forgot you were an expert.
- Oh, dude, running away?

10:39.924 --> 10:42.593
- It's very Seth Cohen...
- No, I'm not.

10:43.737 --> 10:45.806
I mean, I am, but I'm coming back.

10:46.115 --> 10:49.151
I just thought I'd show up for the weekend, you know, surprise her.

10:51.015 --> 10:53.538
I don't know, man. I think Lindsay's had

10:53.774 --> 10:57.370
enough surprises. You should really try and give her some time.

10:59.672 --> 11:01.760
How am I supposed to do that?

11:02.284 --> 11:05.552
Well, for starters, you can keep yourself distracted.

11:06.188 --> 11:10.944
Now, Marissa and Summer are heading over to the mall to pick up some clothes for charity.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.620
Think about what's at the mall.
There's a movie theater.

11:13.856 --> 11:17.197
There's an arcade. There's a CPK

11:17.431 --> 11:22.061
featuring exotic toppings from around the world on a seasoned herb crust.

11:22.242 --> 11:27.397
And I'll tell you this much. If by tomorrow morning you still want to go to Chicago,

11:27.559 --> 11:31.227
I promise you, I will drive you to the bus stop myself

11:31.544 --> 11:35.220
and I will generate a fantastic cover story for the parents.

11:42.324 --> 11:45.792
- Yeah.
- Good. It's settled.

11:46.010 --> 11:48.696
"Bus 5675, Camp Pendleton, is now boarding"

11:48.860 --> 11:51.236
I'm saving Private Ryan.

11:57.607 --> 12:00.802
Ah, home, sweet home. Sweet, sweet shopping.

12:01.110 --> 12:04.386
24 hours, buddy. You're gonna feel like a new man.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.138
- How's our trouper?
- Work's not done yet.

12:12.227 --> 12:14.967
Hey, the Tower of Pisa.
That's in Italy, right?

12:15.131 --> 12:17.854
Come on! Ryan and Marissa alone?
Just awkward. Let's go.

12:23.599 --> 12:27.329
The stuff for the women's shelter's in these boxes and on this rack.

12:27.438 --> 12:28.346
Ah. Thanks.

12:28.491 --> 12:31.473
As if those poor women's lives weren't hard enough.

12:32.026 --> 12:34.350
Someone should get a restraining order against that coat.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.694
We close early today, so don't take too long.

12:39.854 --> 12:42.787
Okay. Looks like somebody missed the sensitivity training seminar.

12:43.410 --> 12:48.580
You guys, this is gonna be so much fun, though. It's like we have a backstage pass to the mall.

12:48.813 --> 12:52.621
Backstage pass to the mall.
Summer, come here. You're so cute.

12:54.707 --> 12:57.713
- I'll take pants, you take sweaters.
- Sounds perfect.

13:02.768 --> 13:05.135
Do you think we should put your photo on the cover every month?

13:05.266 --> 13:09.114
Maybe sometimes we could show Newport.
You know, a house... the beach?

13:09.357 --> 13:13.646
Then what's the incentive to buy the magazine? I mean, if people want to see the beach, they could just go there.

13:14.317 --> 13:15.934
That would just be wrong.

13:17.205 --> 13:22.333
- Hi, Carter. I'm Kirsten. This is Julie.
- A pleasure to meet you both.

13:22.478 --> 13:26.706
Julie Cooper-Nichol, CEO of the Newport Group and founder of Newport Living.

13:27.214 --> 13:31.154
What Julie meant to say was that she is also pleased... to meet you.

13:32.449 --> 13:35.826
Look, I don't know you, and I'm not going to lie to you:

13:35.953 --> 13:38.603
- This magazine is about us.
- It's really more about her.

13:38.694 --> 13:44.363
And people who aspire to be like us. We don't need some outsider coming in and telling us what to do, no offense.

13:44.719 --> 13:48.511
None taken. If it's any consolation, I don't want to be here and more than you want me here.

13:49.455 --> 13:51.307
- You don't.
- Why not? What's wrong with here?

13:51.543 --> 13:56.733
I just don't think the world needs more proclamations about how mukluks are the new Uggs

13:56.824 --> 13:58.981
- Our bar's not that low.
- He's right about mukluks. Write that down.

13:59.144 --> 14:00.781
Look, this can be painless.

14:01.048 --> 14:05.843
I know that you resent the publisher foisting me on your magazine and I resent being foisted.

14:06.569 --> 14:09.181
May this be the first of many things we have in common.

14:09.508 --> 14:13.357
We'll sit down a couple of times a week, you guys'll do what you want, and I'll go home with my paycheck.

14:14.410 --> 14:17.409
Now... who wants a cocktail?

14:20.218 --> 14:22.795
CALEB: Sorry about the ring, Sanford.
SANDY: Star?

14:22.904 --> 14:25.688
Come, come. Never picked you for a rum man. Thank you.

14:26.824 --> 14:30.600
Thank you... for your help,
much as I resisted it.

14:32.014 --> 14:34.628
Your support has been alarmingly genuine.

14:35.046 --> 14:38.459
What you're doing is a nice thing for Kiki.

14:39.421 --> 14:43.997
Guess I figured making one daughter happy might take the edge off hurting the other one.

14:44.176 --> 14:46.118
Oh, I don't know if that's possible.

14:47.135 --> 14:50.583
How would you know, Mr. Self-Righteous I Never Hurt People, I Only Help Them?

14:51.055 --> 14:54.776
- I hurt Kirsten.
- What did you do?

14:57.536 --> 15:01.144
- An old relationship came back into my life
- You had an affair?

15:01.257 --> 15:04.639
No... but... this woman, Rebecca,

15:05.002 --> 15:07.793
was very important to me once and...

15:07.997 --> 15:11.421
having her around took a real toll on me and my marriage.

15:11.739 --> 15:15.098
So... I'm trying to make it up to Kirsten.

15:15.801 --> 15:18.002
Hence, my foray into plumbing.

15:18.479 --> 15:23.652
- That ring means a lot to her.
- Well, it took me a long time to save up enough money to buy it.

15:23.923 --> 15:27.735
If memory serves, you proposed using a prize from a Cracker Jack box.

15:28.030 --> 15:33.840
No, it wasn't from a Cracker Jack box.
I won that ring from the Cliff House Arcade in San Francisco.

15:34.677 --> 15:38.920
And my beautiful daughter walked around for years with a hunk of plastic on her finger.

15:51.336 --> 15:53.151
Marissa?

16:12.274 --> 16:14.525
Hey, it's Marissa, leave a message.

16:15.868 --> 16:17.375
Hey, uh...

16:18.156 --> 16:21.897
house isn't broken into, so I'm assuming you haven't been abducted, but, uh...

16:24.926 --> 16:27.504
Guess I'm gonna jump in the shower.
Call me.

16:33.727 --> 16:38.465
- Stop, it's creepy. I'm gonna break out.
- Aw... Break out. You're so cute.

16:48.715 --> 16:51.964
So, how are you...
with Lindsay and everything?

16:52.309 --> 16:55.468
Honestly, I'm not so good. How about you?

16:56.084 --> 16:59.243
- I'm thrilled to get out of the house.
- Yeah? You back to your mom's?

17:00.078 --> 17:02.311
No. Alex's.

17:03.237 --> 17:05.830
I mean... our place, I guess.

17:16.525 --> 17:18.286
You guys, I think we're stuck in here.

17:18.432 --> 17:21.194
That clueless sales skank!
She probably did it on purpose.

17:21.251 --> 17:23.648
- Well, let's just call someone.
- Help!

17:24.002 --> 17:27.255
- On the phone.
- Yeah, except there is no phone...

17:27.347 --> 17:28.490
I have a c...

17:30.377 --> 17:32.858
There's no cell service!
Wait. I have an idea.

17:34.875 --> 17:37.487
Good idea! Here you go, buddy.
Go to town.

17:38.154 --> 17:40.094
Now, why would you assume I know how to pick a lock?

17:40.499 --> 17:43.009
- I didn't think anything.
- Come on. Think.
- ...give it a try.

17:45.217 --> 17:47.168
So, not my specialty....

17:49.045 --> 17:52.727
- Come on. You getting it?
- Talk to me, baby.

17:54.118 --> 17:56.728
- Is it coming?
- Yeah, I'm hearing something, all right

17:57.465 --> 18:02.174
Okay, good news, guys. I almost got it, but then what happened was, uh, I broke it.

18:03.289 --> 18:09.043
This is like the episode of The Valley where Jake goes to the bank to get his bar mitzvah money out, and him and April get locked in the vault.

18:09.220 --> 18:12.147
- Well, how'd they get out?
- They didn't; they had to wait till the bank opened in the morning.

18:12.282 --> 18:14.511
- That's how April got pregnant.
- I know, sweetie.

18:14.596 --> 18:16.639
There's gotta be a way out of here.

18:19.418 --> 18:20.834
- You guys...
- What's up?

18:21.016 --> 18:23.067
What about over there?

18:38.862 --> 18:41.440
Hey, Ryan, what did I tell you?
Isn't this great?

18:42.312 --> 18:46.687
It's like Goonies meets Die Hard
by way of Mission: Impossible.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.718
With, I think, a... ( sniffing )

18:49.571 --> 18:51.459
slight hint of National Treasure thrown in

18:51.568 --> 18:53.366
Hey, about before, when I told you to shut up?

18:53.983 --> 18:57.993
- Yeah, no, I'm doing it again.
- Uh, no, no, uh... thanks, man...

18:58.683 --> 19:00.789
for getting me out of here... in here.

19:02.187 --> 19:05.978
Yeah... not giving up.
Yeah... That's good. That's what I do.

19:10.718 --> 19:12.963
Ryan, I think I found a quicker way out.

19:13.075 --> 19:15.616
Return to the ladies.
I will liberate you all.

19:16.088 --> 19:19.229
- Well, I think this is the last of it.
- Yes.

19:20.645 --> 19:22.461
So, you and Seth seem happy.

19:25.635 --> 19:30.863
I really want it to be different this time.
For better or for worse. I really feel connected to him.

19:33.775 --> 19:37.098
- I mean, do you feel that way with Alex?
- Well, truthfully,

19:37.697 --> 19:41.417
I think the only person I've ever really felt that way with... is...

19:45.919 --> 19:48.822
Is it weird being here with him and me and Cohen?

19:48.931 --> 19:51.563
- No, it's fine.
- Good.

19:52.199 --> 19:55.247
Because I know you're, like, you know, into chicks now and everything but

19:55.356 --> 19:57.680
do you ever think about getting back together with him?

19:57.879 --> 20:00.128
I mean, Lindsay's gone now and...

20:00.419 --> 20:03.160
Yeah, Lindsay's gone. And he's heartbroken.

20:03.705 --> 20:05.393
Do you miss him?

20:08.174 --> 20:09.971
Every day.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.778
Hey, guys. Where's, um...?

20:17.994 --> 20:19.900
Hey, Ryan!

20:23.801 --> 20:25.490
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

20:30.500 --> 20:33.675
RYAN: So why is no one else here?
SUMMER: The store's closed?

20:34.692 --> 20:37.379
SETH: Let's find an exit and get out of here.
RYAN: Good idea.

20:37.978 --> 20:39.955
SUMMER: Wait, wait, wait.
We're not going anywhere.

20:40.209 --> 20:42.279
Yeah, I know, 'cause we're trapped,
so let's...

20:42.406 --> 20:45.127
Yes, trapped... in a department store.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.778
Which is my ultimate fantasy.

20:48.250 --> 20:50.864
- M'kay. And what if we get caught?
- We'll be stealth.

20:51.043 --> 20:54.838
Come on, you guys. What could be cooler?
Go to sleep in a mall and wake up in a mall?

20:56.288 --> 20:58.303
Come on, it's like being awake, but still dreaming.

20:58.648 --> 21:02.805
The mall doesn't open till 10:00 a.m.
We'll be out before then.
We could get McMuffins.

21:06.053 --> 21:10.501
I suppose we could all use a night to forget our troubles, and by all, I mean Ryan.

21:11.826 --> 21:13.024
That's true.

21:13.260 --> 21:14.767
So it's settled then.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.997
What happens in the mall stays in the mall

21:20.105 --> 21:21.557
SUMMER: Cool!

21:21.972 --> 21:25.131
Sorry to wake you... at 8:00 at night.

21:25.240 --> 21:28.000
Can you tell my dad that I'm sleeping at Marissa's?

21:28.127 --> 21:32.355
Hey, sorry I missed your call. I just brought some laundry over to my mom's place.

21:32.882 --> 21:35.658
I was thinking I might just spend the night

21:35.785 --> 21:38.199
Yeah, so, anyway... call my cell.

21:38.417 --> 21:41.540
Dad, so, Ryan and I are trapped in the mall and we're gonna spend the night here.

21:41.703 --> 21:46.352
I know that credit card is just for emergencies, but I may have to shell out for a few supplies.

21:48.164 --> 21:51.902
It's a little something I like to call the truth. So what do we do now?

21:52.029 --> 21:53.372
Hmm... I have an idea.

21:59.817 --> 22:01.741
You're gonna kill us all with a chain saw?

22:01.869 --> 22:06.063
No... high score gets the bed in the Ethan Allen showroom, low score takes the tent.

22:06.390 --> 22:07.787
We're playing sports?!

22:17.953 --> 22:19.115
Oh, what?! Come on!

22:27.286 --> 22:29.228
- Cohen! Offsides!
- What?

23:01.876 --> 23:03.510
Oh, my God.

23:05.004 --> 23:07.455
Hey, it's the new body shimmer.
Hmm, shimmery.

23:08.885 --> 23:11.721
You guys... Enough with the sports.
Let's eat.

23:37.373 --> 23:41.094
- Uh... I think I'll go to the bar.
- Great. I'll have a Pinot Grigio.

23:46.574 --> 23:48.680
- Can I get you something?
- No, thank you.

23:49.368 --> 23:53.021
- What the hell are you doing here, Lance?
- That's no way to greet your first love.

23:53.162 --> 23:56.433
- You weren't my first love, just my first
- They say a girl never forgets.

23:56.646 --> 24:00.050
Maybe she had so much Southern Comfort she never remembered in the first place.

24:00.227 --> 24:02.696
Maybe we should try a reenactment.

24:06.401 --> 24:09.942
I know you, okay? So cut to the chase.
You wouldn't be here if you didn't want something.

24:10.087 --> 24:12.302
Actually, I have something for you.

24:12.465 --> 24:16.115
Yeah? Last time you gave me something,
I drank cranberry juice for a week.

24:23.044 --> 24:26.385
- What did I ever do to you?
- I've been watching you rise, baby.

24:26.820 --> 24:29.870
Married to the richest man in town,
living in the biggest house.

24:30.851 --> 24:33.192
- You want money?
- Take a look.

24:33.647 --> 24:35.571
Tell me how much it's worth to you.

24:36.334 --> 24:39.547
- I have two daughters now.
- I know.

24:39.892 --> 24:42.179
And aren't they worth protecting?

24:50.906 --> 24:54.102
Guys, I'm suddenly not feeling so well.

24:55.081 --> 24:57.731
Food poisoning or something.

24:57.840 --> 24:59.982
You haven't eaten.

25:03.266 --> 25:06.370
Cohen! Cohen!

25:07.024 --> 25:09.402
I was foraging. Here.

25:10.473 --> 25:13.576
What is it? "Chicken-flavored soy malt".

25:14.157 --> 25:17.225
- It's kosher.
- It's only 3,600 calories.

25:28.562 --> 25:30.068
- Hey, Summer.
- What?

25:30.159 --> 25:34.462
Could you maybe go grab another papier-mach log for the faux fire?

25:34.680 --> 25:36.658
That way we can make fake s'mores.

25:39.766 --> 25:41.690
Yeah, sure.

25:54.384 --> 25:56.924
Don't do it... Don't do it.

25:57.759 --> 25:59.756
Okay, let's do it.

26:08.761 --> 26:12.023
Hey, I can't find... Cohen,

26:12.789 --> 26:14.377
what are you doing?

26:18.392 --> 26:20.888
"Hey, I got a pizza for, uh..."

26:22.476 --> 26:25.483
"...you. Didn't we have sex?"

26:26.051 --> 26:28.291
"No. I'm a virgin."

26:28.575 --> 26:31.071
"At least I think I am."

26:39.155 --> 26:41.821
"Why don't you stay for a slice?
Are you hungry?"

26:42.048 --> 26:45.821
"Starving. You really don't remember me?"

26:46.417 --> 26:50.047
"No. I have amnesia. I don't remember anything."

26:57.704 --> 27:00.116
Oh, my God.
"Remember that?"

27:02.356 --> 27:05.278
It's cool. A little porn on a Saturday night.

27:05.533 --> 27:07.774
- My lips are sealed.
- What are you doing here?

27:07.973 --> 27:11.856
- Looking for Marissa. She left a message that she was here.
- Well, she's not.

27:14.948 --> 27:17.671
I guess I'm not the only one she lies to, huh?

27:22.689 --> 27:24.902
I know my daughter.

27:25.469 --> 27:29.554
I only let her go with you because I knew it was a matter of time before she came back.

27:30.547 --> 27:35.255
As much as Marissa likes to complain, she had a very nice life, thanks to me,

27:36.106 --> 27:40.317
one she'll miss once the novelty wears off, which I'm guessing is about now.

27:45.804 --> 27:47.818
Marissa...

27:48.669 --> 27:50.456
Marissa is not happy.

27:52.268 --> 27:55.218
Marissa and "happy" parted ways about her 16th birthday.

27:55.360 --> 27:58.650
But have you met her new friends "sullen" and "vindictive"?

28:00.097 --> 28:05.430
No. The only ones she's brought over to the house are "scared" and "overwhelmed."

28:09.185 --> 28:11.028
Alex...

28:12.759 --> 28:15.737
and I'm not saying this to be mean because

28:15.907 --> 28:19.567
you actually seem like a nice enough girl and I like your pants...

28:20.730 --> 28:23.963
but you are this week's yard guy,

28:25.733 --> 28:29.676
Marissa's latest drama-weapon of torture to inflict against me.

28:31.832 --> 28:34.810
- You don't know that.
- Yeah, honey, I do.

28:36.342 --> 28:38.554
Marissa's only been in love once,

28:38.753 --> 28:41.476
and he looked a whole lot different in a wife-beater.

28:48.845 --> 28:51.310
- What'd you find?
- Gift baskets.

28:51.480 --> 28:55.820
- Crackers, brie, raspberry preserves.
- Nice.

28:57.068 --> 28:59.106
Oh, candy counter.

28:59.508 --> 29:02.231
Macaroons, licorice bits.

29:06.922 --> 29:09.228
- Why are you so mad?
- Why were you looking in my purse?

29:09.391 --> 29:13.875
- Why were you getting postcard from Zach?
- Because when I talked to him, I told him to send me a postcard.

29:14.491 --> 29:16.488
- You talked to him?
- Yes.

29:16.688 --> 29:19.556
What, am I going to ditch him at the airport and then not take his calls?

29:19.883 --> 29:22.933
Look. Cohen, he's my friend.
He's your friend, too.

29:23.223 --> 29:26.798
Yeah, and friends let friends read postcards, so why can't I just see it?

29:26.997 --> 29:31.264
- Why can't you just trust me that it doesn't say anything?
- Because I know it says something hot.

29:31.536 --> 29:35.347
I saw what he wrote.
"Do you remember how hot it was?"
And the rest was covered up by a stamp.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.496
MARISSA: Hey. We brought macaroons.
RYAN: Spray cheese.

29:38.678 --> 29:40.566
Ooh! Who's hungry?

29:48.902 --> 29:50.954
CALEB: That big yellow one there.

29:51.131 --> 29:53.128
Relax. Relax.

29:53.273 --> 29:56.028
You're talking to a master here.
It's all in the timing.

30:05.384 --> 30:08.089
Another keychain.

30:08.541 --> 30:11.518
I really wanted to win this for Kirsten,
prove to her.

30:12.197 --> 30:16.663
- Prove to her what?
- That she's the love of my life, that I cherish her above all others.

30:16.808 --> 30:19.930
You don't need a crappy piece of plastic to do that. Just tell her.

30:25.652 --> 30:29.011
- But you really want that ring, don't you?
- More than anything.

30:30.717 --> 30:33.475
I'll get more quarters.

30:36.361 --> 30:39.284
- We're really roughing it, huh?
- Yeah.

30:42.568 --> 30:45.291
All alone in the wilderness.

30:53.629 --> 30:58.104
Maybe we should find Seth and Summer, watch a movie. We do have, like, 500 TV screens all to ourselves.

30:58.467 --> 31:01.860
- Yeah, that sounds good, but...
- Right, probably want their privacy.

31:03.603 --> 31:05.691
What happens at the mall stays at the mall.

31:13.569 --> 31:15.366
- I should, uh...
- Yeah.

31:20.701 --> 31:23.334
Oh, yeah, I didn't end up going to my mom's.

31:25.057 --> 31:26.564
Well, I ran into Summer.

31:29.051 --> 31:33.263
I think I'm just going to hang at her place. I'll see you in the morning?

31:34.550 --> 31:36.002
Okay, bye.

31:44.902 --> 31:46.645
- Alex?
- Yeah.

31:48.751 --> 31:50.530
Oh, it's not that she's the jealous type.

31:51.982 --> 31:54.578
- Right, I mean, why would she be jealous?
- Exactly.

31:55.726 --> 31:58.958
- She'd just be bummed to be missing...
- All this.

32:08.754 --> 32:10.914
- Tired?
- Exhausted.

32:11.114 --> 32:14.255
Go for it. I'll camp out here.
Keep an eye out for bears and mall cops.

32:14.509 --> 32:17.800
- No, you take it.
- No offense, but you're not really the "roughing it" type.

32:18.211 --> 32:20.625
It's big enough for two.
It says it sleeps four.

32:42.491 --> 32:45.233
- I'm not mad at you anymore.
- Well, I'm mad at you.

32:45.505 --> 32:47.538
Fine. Then I am mad at you.

32:47.792 --> 32:51.133
I don't get it, why can't you just tell me what happened with you and Zach that was so hot?

32:51.287 --> 32:53.954
- Shh!
- What? Don't-don't shush me. Listen...

32:54.081 --> 32:57.040
Shh! Company.

33:01.607 --> 33:03.150
What?

33:04.094 --> 33:06.327
- That means "due south." Just...
- Get... ow!

33:09.940 --> 33:12.835
I can't believe Seth and Summer...
back together.

33:13.206 --> 33:15.185
Finally. Now we don't have to hear about it

33:15.403 --> 33:19.270
- I'm sure we'll still be hearing about it.
- They're probably fighting right now.

33:21.938 --> 33:25.024
You remember last year when she went over to his house for Thanksgiving?

33:25.224 --> 33:28.655
- Yeah. And Anna was over there.
- She was so pissed.

33:28.764 --> 33:31.231
I wish we could've been there to see it.

33:33.264 --> 33:37.022
Yeah. Too bad we were busy driving stolen cars around Chino.

33:40.786 --> 33:42.547
Yeah, that's my brother Trey.

33:42.693 --> 33:45.416
- Even though we were almost killed, it was
- Kind of fun.

33:51.488 --> 33:53.558
We need to go right now.

33:53.794 --> 33:58.260
So, you're going to spend the next six months devoted to Julie Cooper's vanity project?

33:58.351 --> 34:03.515
What happened to The Ugly American?
That was the hottest travel magazine.

34:03.650 --> 34:05.883
Yeah, well, it's a long story.

34:05.992 --> 34:08.648
Actually, it's a short story...
about a long bender.

34:09.694 --> 34:11.726
I was in the middle of a divorce at the time.

34:12.253 --> 34:14.447
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:15.828 --> 34:19.440
Why is it whenever I say I'm divorced, people act like somebody's just died?

34:21.726 --> 34:24.359
- You ever been married?
- I am married.

34:24.902 --> 34:28.716
- You're not wearing a ring.
- I-I lost it.

34:29.260 --> 34:32.219
I mean, I took it off and I can't find it.

34:32.980 --> 34:35.757
That's a strong statement, taking off your wedding ring.

34:36.429 --> 34:38.245
I was potting geraniums.

34:41.469 --> 34:44.936
The night I realized my wife didn't love me anymore

34:45.027 --> 34:47.060
I found her ring by the kitchen sink.

34:47.242 --> 34:51.107
She said she'd been scrubbing a casserole dish.

34:51.306 --> 34:54.918
- Those casseroles can be a bitch.
- So could my ex.

35:00.716 --> 35:03.750
You know, I don't think we've said two words about the magazine since

35:03.841 --> 35:06.473
Julie Cooper Nichol left the building.

35:07.761 --> 35:10.284
I don't think we've accomplished our goals for the day.

35:10.847 --> 35:13.607
Well, I thought your goal was getting paid for doing nothing.

35:13.806 --> 35:16.709
Let's just say I'm finding Newport Living

35:16.818 --> 35:19.305
a lot more interesting than I thought it would be.

35:22.301 --> 35:24.661
GIRL: "She is so into you."
GUY: "You think?"

35:24.866 --> 35:28.814
GIRL: "I know. April told me so herself."
GUY: "I don't get it. Sometimes..."

35:29.041 --> 35:30.380
We got 'em.

35:30.607 --> 35:34.440
GUY: "...and then she just ignores me."
GIRL: "It's called playing you hot and cold."

35:34.621 --> 35:37.732
GIRL: "And it's totally working. April is a genius."

35:37.859 --> 35:40.455
"If they've gave MacArthur grants for pulling guys,"

35:40.564 --> 35:42.732
"she would win, like, every year."

35:56.643 --> 35:59.983
- That was awesome.
- Dude, it's called triple time. twood, floor it, man.

36:01.850 --> 36:05.136
- Anyone hungry?
- I'm sure Summer would like Italian.

36:05.444 --> 36:09.449
- God, give it up, Cohen.
- Okay, I will stop with the teasing when you confess.

36:09.600 --> 36:12.323
Okay, and I'll stop punching you when you shut up!

36:15.026 --> 36:17.858
- We thinking cheeseburgers?
- And chili fries? Perfect.

36:18.076 --> 36:19.655
Come on, I could drop you.

36:24.550 --> 36:27.473
- Hello?
- Enjoy the show?

36:27.927 --> 36:31.592
- I'll write you a check for $50,000 right now.
- 50 Gs.

36:31.992 --> 36:36.367
You spend that much to keep your pool clean. I was thinking more like $500,000.

36:37.999 --> 36:41.648
- Are you crazy?
- I could make more than that selling that tape on the Internet.

36:43.064 --> 36:45.188
- I cannot get that kind of money...
- I think you can.

36:45.352 --> 36:48.073
- without my husband knowing. What am I supposed to tell him?
- Tell him the truth,

36:48.237 --> 36:53.215
that your mom was sick and your sister was pregnant, and you realized your tips from waitressing weren't going to pay the rent that month.

36:54.413 --> 36:58.185
Or... make something up.

37:01.752 --> 37:04.385
SETH: So why can't I see it?
SUMMER: Because it's not a big deal.

37:06.479 --> 37:09.702
- God, what does it matter, Cohen?
- It matters to me.
- All right, we'll be inside.

37:09.838 --> 37:13.287
- You guys coming?
- No, I think we need to stay here so I don't strangle him in public.

37:13.423 --> 37:15.093
Okay, we'll save room in the booth.

37:20.741 --> 37:23.882
How is it that Ryan and Marissa are now the functional couple?

37:24.336 --> 37:28.410
Oh, my God. Okay, we cannot be more annoying than Ryan and Marissa.

37:28.927 --> 37:31.451
- We're monsters.
- I like monsters, but not us.

37:31.614 --> 37:33.670
Do we not work as a couple anymore?

37:33.833 --> 37:37.101
- Are we all setup and no payoff?
- All preparation, no H.

37:38.335 --> 37:40.530
Okay... pinkie swear.

37:40.657 --> 37:44.778
- If I tell you what's on the postcard,
we stop bickering.
- About the postcard.

37:45.795 --> 37:47.192
Okay, pinkie swear.

37:53.336 --> 37:54.988
Okay. Look...

37:56.059 --> 37:59.761
Here. Right under the stamp, what's so hot...

38:00.360 --> 38:02.230
is the weather.

38:03.480 --> 38:06.085
Oh, yeah. Right there.

38:06.284 --> 38:09.350
And if you look down here, the sign-off?

38:09.750 --> 38:12.182
No "I love you", not even an "I miss you",
but...

38:12.346 --> 38:14.561
"Say hi to Seth." That's from Zach.

38:30.293 --> 38:32.780
I definitely think we work as a couple.

38:39.175 --> 38:41.262
Sorry, I didn't think I was going to be so late.

38:45.057 --> 38:46.273
I didn't find your ring.

38:47.725 --> 38:50.156
- Oh, you were looking for my ring?
- Me and your father.

38:50.446 --> 38:54.622
We made a day of it. He was upset about Lindsay, and I was upset about...

38:56.508 --> 38:58.215
I was just upset.

38:58.977 --> 39:01.120
We'll find our groove... and my ring.

39:02.463 --> 39:06.274
In the meantime, we're going to have to do the dishes and things

39:06.491 --> 39:08.452
in the bathroom sink because I...

39:09.196 --> 39:13.856
I lost the bolt and all the... that keeps the pipe and the... the thing together.

39:15.076 --> 39:16.637
But just know this...

39:25.762 --> 39:27.178
I love you.

39:28.519 --> 39:31.896
And I'm so sorry I did anything to make you doubt it.

40:29.718 --> 40:31.877
You know, it's funny,

40:32.004 --> 40:36.642
or not funny really, but we've been apart longer than we were together.

40:38.259 --> 40:41.726
- It has been a while.
- Yeah, a lot's happened.

40:44.776 --> 40:47.064
I guess you could say we're kind of like strangers.

40:50.895 --> 40:53.854
Yeah? So who are you?

40:55.397 --> 40:57.013
Whoever you want me to be.

41:08.664 --> 41:10.806
Look at that, my little Summer.

41:11.061 --> 41:14.328
Seems like the Fantastic Four is becoming fantastic again.
