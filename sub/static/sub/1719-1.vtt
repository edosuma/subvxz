01:19.662 --> 01:22.499
Did you see what's happening?

01:25.126 --> 01:26.628
Come on, come on, let's go!

01:41.309 --> 01:42.477
Hey, what's going on?

01:42.686 --> 01:44.688
In there. It's on the news.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.572
<i>Then, 18 minutes later,</i>

01:54.656 --> 01:57.242
<i>a second one went into
the other twin tower.</i>

01:57.325 --> 02:01.287
<i>Can you paint us a picture
of the situation in New York...</i>

02:01.371 --> 02:04.374
<i>An everyday morning situation,
presumably pretty busy in the streets,</i>

02:04.457 --> 02:05.625
<i>people going about their business.</i>

02:05.709 --> 02:08.044
<i>Well, it's a beautiful day
here in New York.</i>

02:08.086 --> 02:10.505
<i>Everyone is out in the street,
everyone's on their rooftops,</i>

02:10.547 --> 02:12.632
<i>everyone's on their mobile phones.</i>

02:12.716 --> 02:15.385
<i>I don't think people can quite
believe what's happened.</i>

02:15.427 --> 02:17.178
<i>Given that this is the financial district,</i>

02:17.220 --> 02:18.304
<i>is it your understanding that people...</i>

02:18.388 --> 02:20.098
You're American, aren't you?
Sorry, mate.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.474
<i>May actually be inside
the World Trade Center?</i>

02:21.558 --> 02:22.958
<i>I mean, without a shadow of a doubt</i>

02:23.018 --> 02:25.520
<i>there will be people in there.
They get to work very early.</i>

02:25.562 --> 02:28.106
<i>And what about
the emergency services?</i>

02:30.066 --> 02:32.444
<i>I, John Patrick Ryan,</i>

02:32.527 --> 02:35.030
<i>do solemnly swear that
I will support and defend</i>

02:35.071 --> 02:37.323
<i>the Constitution of the United States</i>

02:37.407 --> 02:39.534
<i>against all enemies,
foreign and domestic,</i>

02:39.576 --> 02:42.328
<i>that I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same</i>

02:42.996 --> 02:46.374
<i>and that I will obey the orders
of the President of the United States</i>

02:46.416 --> 02:49.085
<i>and the orders of the officers
appointed over me</i>

02:49.169 --> 02:52.422
<i>according to regulations and the
Uniform Code of Military Justice,</i>

02:52.464 --> 02:54.215
<i>so help me, God.</i>

02:54.257 --> 02:55.592
- Come on, then!
- I got one!

02:55.633 --> 02:57.344
- Let's hear it!
- Richmond Webb.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.428
You serious?

02:58.511 --> 03:00.388
My man was a seven-time Pro Bowler.

03:00.430 --> 03:01.931
I'm just saying Brown's better.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.767
Man, how come every
cat from Baltimore

03:03.808 --> 03:05.977
always got to bring up Orlando Brown?

03:06.102 --> 03:08.823
Because Brown's the most underrated
offensive tackle in the business.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.774
- Have you ever seen him play?
- What? Aw, man.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.109
Yes, this is Lieutenant Ryan.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.196
Yes, sir, I did. I was wondering

03:16.279 --> 03:19.991
if you had a chance to forward my
report on the Saabir Khan Bridge

03:20.075 --> 03:21.993
to anyone in intel.

03:22.077 --> 03:25.622
Yes, sir, they are
the same findings I already reported.

03:25.705 --> 03:29.793
I just can't help noticing a correlation
between traffic patterns there

03:29.876 --> 03:31.044
and the region's other...

03:32.796 --> 03:34.673
Well, if they do respond,

03:34.756 --> 03:37.842
I would be happy to explain it to
whoever's in charge of regional...

03:38.510 --> 03:39.803
Sir?

03:41.221 --> 03:43.181
Still no love from the C.O.?

03:43.264 --> 03:45.725
I don't get it. I'm just trying to help.

03:45.809 --> 03:47.352
Hey, guys. Buckle up in the back.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.688
We're running into a little turbulence.

03:49.771 --> 03:50.814
You all right there, Private?

03:50.855 --> 03:52.315
- Sir, yes, sir!
- Good man!

03:52.399 --> 03:55.402
Man, I still don't get
why you requested this detail.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.113
Big brain like yours, man, why aren't
you behind some desk somewhere?

03:58.154 --> 03:59.614
You requested this?

03:59.656 --> 04:01.825
I just figured if I was gonna serve,
I should serve.

04:01.866 --> 04:04.619
Man, that's some patriotic
shit right there, you see that?

04:04.661 --> 04:07.288
You're all right, Lieutenant.
Even if your team is wack.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.708
Oh, stop talking trash
on my Ravens, homeboy.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.502
I'm a Bengals fan.

04:12.544 --> 04:13.837
The Bengals?

04:14.796 --> 04:17.632
Rookie, get that harness on
and stop trying to be down.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.843
Man, you got a lot to learn, Davies.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.762
Left in, right twist, click.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.014
Thank you, sir!

04:30.562 --> 04:31.813
You want some help?

04:48.705 --> 04:49.706
Move, move, move!

04:49.789 --> 04:51.458
Chopper crash.
Spinal cord should be okay,

04:51.541 --> 04:53.877
but he's got two shattered vertebrae
and no feeling in his legs.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.045
Lieutenant Ryan!

04:55.545 --> 04:58.048
Lieutenant Ryan!
Did anyone else make it out alive?

04:58.381 --> 04:59.883
Yeah, two.
Ryan dragged them both out.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.634
With a broken back?

05:01.718 --> 05:03.970
Okay, we're gonna have a look at
you and it's gonna hurt, okay?

05:04.054 --> 05:05.555
X-rays are on the board.

05:05.638 --> 05:06.765
Okay, turn him!

05:12.228 --> 05:13.355
Okay, clear him!

05:13.396 --> 05:15.398
Down on three. One, two, three.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.608
Can't do anything from here.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.735
Evac him to NATO trauma
in Kandahar right now.

05:18.777 --> 05:21.363
Get an ear out to Dr. Hardesty.
Tell him to prep for a foraminotomy

05:21.404 --> 05:23.239
or possible spondylolisthesis.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.492
We've got spinal compression
and root damage at minimum.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.911
Lieutenant has about a 90-minute
window if he wants to walk again.

05:27.952 --> 05:29.037
Okay, move, move!

05:29.079 --> 05:30.413
Let's go. Come on, come on!

05:30.455 --> 05:31.706
Out of the way! Out of the way!

05:32.165 --> 05:33.625
That guy's done in this war.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.139
Gently.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.560
Push more to the next level.

05:55.563 --> 05:56.731
Good.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.276
That's really good, Jack.

06:04.155 --> 06:05.573
Come on. You can do this.

06:05.615 --> 06:06.783
Get up.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.785
I don't like you very much, Doctor.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.788
I'm not a doctor.
I'm a 3rd-year med student

06:11.830 --> 06:15.208
who is four credits short in P.T.
until you decide to walk.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.544
You're sick. You're a sadist.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.923
Come on, meet me halfway.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.263
Give me two Percocet.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.349
Get up and I'll ask them for one.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.280
How long's he been here?

06:45.321 --> 06:46.656
Eight months.

06:47.323 --> 06:49.868
Think he'll ever walk
without the crutches?

06:50.827 --> 06:51.911
Maybe.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.081
If he decides he has somewhere to go.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.513
I'd like to talk to him.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.349
Sure.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.100
Not yet.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.604
But soon.

07:20.357 --> 07:23.109
Will you do me a favor and wait two
minutes before you take that?

07:24.277 --> 07:25.362
Why?

07:25.987 --> 07:27.864
So that you know you can.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.184
- Lieutenant Ryan?
- Yes, sir?

07:56.226 --> 07:57.477
Please, at ease.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.938
Commander Thomas Harper, U.S. Navy.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.401
Why the uniform today?

08:05.026 --> 08:06.403
I beg your pardon?

08:06.444 --> 08:09.572
I mean, you were wearing a suit and tie
the last time you were here.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.825
You watched me from
behind the glass in rehab.

08:12.283 --> 08:13.910
What can I do for you, Commander?

08:14.285 --> 08:15.745
You've already done it.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.540
I just want to say thank you
for your service.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.208
I appreciate that.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.835
John P. Ryan, right?

08:22.919 --> 08:23.920
That's right.

08:24.087 --> 08:27.048
The one who wrote <i>Liquidity
Events in Post-Soviet Markets?</i>

08:28.508 --> 08:31.845
Two-thirds of it, yes.
My... My dissertation.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.597
The same John P. Ryan
who filed three separate reports

08:34.681 --> 08:37.851
on traffic patterns in and around
the Saabir Khan Bridge?

08:38.018 --> 08:39.561
Yes, sir.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.229
It's impressive work.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.111
How did you get a hold of that, sir?

08:51.740 --> 08:53.658
I'm in the CIA.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.004
Jack?

09:06.629 --> 09:07.797
Oh, hey.

09:11.801 --> 09:15.680
So, this is... This is good-bye.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.891
I'm glad I found you.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.186
No more P.T. work for you?

09:21.644 --> 09:24.105
No, just eye-doctoring.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.983
Congratulations.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.905
I'm hungry. You wanna buy me dinner?

09:33.948 --> 09:34.991
You know I can't.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.369
All right, you win. I'll buy.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.121
I'll make you a deal.

09:40.163 --> 09:42.415
The day you run all the way out of here,

09:42.499 --> 09:43.667
we'll have dinner.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.002
And split the check.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.090
See ya.

09:50.382 --> 09:51.466
See ya.

10:00.850 --> 10:01.893
Good luck.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.924
Jesus, you weren't kidding.
You are in the CIA.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.385
Somebody has to be.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.848
Why didn't you finish your Ph.D.?

10:40.223 --> 10:43.101
- I joined the Marines.
- And saved two of your men.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.062
You handled yourself like a hero.

10:50.775 --> 10:53.069
If you still want to serve your country,

10:53.570 --> 10:55.280
there's another way.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.574
You're not really in the CIA, are you?

10:59.909 --> 11:02.871
What are you? Treasury?
Foreign Asset Control?

11:05.582 --> 11:08.793
You know, I'm not supposed to tell
anybody what I do for a living.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.755
And now, look, I've just told you twice.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.798
What do you want from me?

11:14.582 --> 11:16.902
I want to send you
back to school to finish your doctorate.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.596
Then you'll join
Financial Intelligence as an analyst.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.765
You'll work in a
series of private banks on Wall Street,

11:21.806 --> 11:25.143
where you'll use your position
to uncover funding for terror groups.

11:25.977 --> 11:27.020
Covertly.

11:27.145 --> 11:30.357
Yep. So you have to keep it to yourself.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.318
Your employers
won't know you work for us.

11:33.401 --> 11:36.154
The people you
love won't know you do, either.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.822
It's gonna get lonely,

11:38.239 --> 11:40.158
but it's how we like to do things.

11:40.784 --> 11:43.912
You know, people don't like you
guys very much these days.

11:44.788 --> 11:46.539
Waterboarding. Rendition.

11:46.623 --> 11:47.916
Not my unit.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.376
Come on. You can do better than that.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.627
I can.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.463
And I do.
And so do the people in my unit.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.090
Which unit is that?

11:56.424 --> 11:59.302
The one that
makes sure we don't get hit again.

12:34.921 --> 12:35.964
I knew.

12:36.006 --> 12:38.299
I knew when you saw me ride it,
you'd want one.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.554
- Nice.
- Yeah.

12:42.846 --> 12:44.180
Oh, her name's Sarah, by the way.

12:44.222 --> 12:45.223
Who?

12:45.306 --> 12:47.142
The one you like in Arbitrage.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.184
How'd you know that?

12:48.268 --> 12:51.104
Why else would anybody
buy a motorcycle?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.356
- Teddy Hefferman?
- Sarah, yes.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.359
Jack Ryan said you could help me
with the Balfour arbitrage.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.485
- How're you doing?
- Hi.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.113
What do you have?

13:01.197 --> 13:02.866
This looks good.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.661
<i>The World Bank urging caution</i>

13:06.703 --> 13:10.123
<i>as volatilities in emerging markets
continue to remind investors</i>

13:10.206 --> 13:12.667
<i>that with unprecedented
global interconnectivity,</i>

13:12.751 --> 13:16.046
<i>even the strongest economies
are vulnerable to collapse.</i>

13:16.129 --> 13:17.172
<i>This just in.</i>

13:17.505 --> 13:19.883
<i>Last minute negotiations
are expected today</i>

13:19.966 --> 13:23.011
<i>as the security council of
the United Nations votes.</i>

13:23.053 --> 13:26.056
<i>Russia's bitterly opposed
to a new Turkish pipeline,</i>

13:26.139 --> 13:30.185
<i>which could see Russian economic
dominance of oil exports shattered.</i>

13:30.268 --> 13:33.605
<i>The big question,
will the U.S. defy Russia?</i>

13:39.527 --> 13:42.655
The only thing that
the Turks and the Georgians

13:42.739 --> 13:45.408
would undermine with their pipeline

13:45.492 --> 13:49.746
is Russia's monopoly on the Eastern
European natural gas market.

13:49.829 --> 13:50.830
We both know that.

13:50.914 --> 13:54.501
If you block our proposal
and the pipeline is approved,

13:54.959 --> 13:57.671
oil falls below $79 a barrel

13:57.754 --> 13:59.422
and the Russian government
goes bankrupt.

13:59.464 --> 14:02.008
In our judgment,
your assessment is extreme.

14:02.092 --> 14:03.259
Thank you.

14:04.928 --> 14:08.390
Our request comes
from my country's highest level.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.851
And it is respectfully denied from mine.

14:12.852 --> 14:17.190
Then we will regard this as
an act of economic war.

14:17.273 --> 14:20.068
<i>While Wall Street talks up
the robust performance of the dollar,</i>

14:20.110 --> 14:21.903
<i>many commentators look to the U.N.</i>

14:21.945 --> 14:24.948
<i>and the bitter standoff
between the United States and Russia.</i>

14:24.989 --> 14:26.783
<i>The U.S. has the upper hand for now,</i>

14:26.825 --> 14:29.160
<i>but fears exist about exactly how
an angry Russia</i>

14:29.285 --> 14:32.706
<i>and Russian business
will react to the likely disastrous effects</i>

14:32.789 --> 14:35.625
<i>for the Russian economy
of America's U.N. veto.</i>

15:07.574 --> 15:10.160
Tell him he will need
somebody in Moscow.

15:10.326 --> 15:13.163
- He'll want you.
- No, I'm just an analyst.

15:13.455 --> 15:16.124
Our Russian partners
are hiding accounts from us.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.793
It's all in the data.

15:19.336 --> 15:21.379
Nobody else understands the data.

15:21.463 --> 15:24.507
Harper will want you.
Just get yourself to Moscow.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.885
<i>Operator. Operator. Operator!</i>

15:26.968 --> 15:28.178
<i>Your call, please.</i>

15:28.219 --> 15:30.889
<i>Operator,
I've been ringing Murray Hill, 35097,</i>

15:30.972 --> 15:32.972
<i>for the last half hour
and the line is always busy.</i>

15:32.974 --> 15:34.601
<i>Will you ring it for me, please?</i>

15:41.274 --> 15:42.525
Hello?

15:47.364 --> 15:48.615
Jack?

16:21.940 --> 16:23.316
You home yet?

16:57.642 --> 16:59.310
I bet you looked cute.

16:59.477 --> 17:01.146
<i>Overseas, where we see</i>

17:01.229 --> 17:03.565
<i>a surprisingly sturdy
performance by the dollar,</i>

17:03.606 --> 17:07.609
<i>holding its ground in spite of
the Turkish pipeline vote at the U.N.</i>

17:07.694 --> 17:09.362
<i>and the latest deficit news.
Anika, your reaction?</i>

17:09.445 --> 17:10.739
<i>Well, surprised,</i>

17:10.780 --> 17:14.284
<i>pleased certainly, but this is extremely
unusual behavior by the market.</i>

17:14.367 --> 17:17.287
<i>Commodities should be moving in
the opposite direction of the dollar.</i>

17:17.317 --> 17:19.598
<i>You'd see a very
different direction by investors as well.</i>

17:19.622 --> 17:21.423
<i>They usually waver
from one day to the next...</i>

17:21.458 --> 17:22.709
Is work okay?

17:24.294 --> 17:27.047
Yeah. Yeah, it was good.
Sorry about that. Yeah.

17:29.591 --> 17:32.594
So, you feel like a movie this weekend?

17:33.053 --> 17:34.137
Sure.

17:34.346 --> 17:37.682
There's a revival of <i>Sorry,
Wrong Number</i> at the Film Forum.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.642
I was thinking that might be fun.

17:42.937 --> 17:43.938
Yeah.

17:46.358 --> 17:47.609
Have you ever seen it?

17:50.070 --> 17:52.447
You know what
I haven't seen is the waiter for, like,

17:52.697 --> 17:54.074
10 minutes. Have you seen him?

17:54.157 --> 17:55.317
- No.
- Where'd he run off to?

17:55.325 --> 17:57.994
Okay. So, should we go?

17:58.078 --> 17:59.954
- Sounds good.
- Good.

18:00.538 --> 18:01.664
Yeah. Let's do it.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.459
- For you, sir?
- Ah. Yeah, the lady will try it.

18:04.501 --> 18:07.003
Yes, I will try it. Thank you.

21:10.020 --> 21:11.187
You want to go to Moscow?

21:11.396 --> 21:12.522
I think we have to.

21:12.731 --> 21:15.442
They're unnamed, uncategorized,
scattered all over the world.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.110
They're hidden accounts, Rob.

21:17.694 --> 21:19.571
These are just the ones
I managed to find.

21:19.696 --> 21:20.739
How did you find them?

21:21.698 --> 21:24.242
- You pay me to look.
- Not to look that hard.

21:26.286 --> 21:27.537
Joke.

21:28.413 --> 21:30.973
- You think they're ripping us off?
- I don't know what to think.

21:31.332 --> 21:33.585
Jesus H. Christ.

21:34.961 --> 21:39.549
You're the compliance officer.
It's your call, but can I ask one thing?

21:39.883 --> 21:42.761
Don't screw up the most
lucrative partnership this company has.

21:44.012 --> 21:46.097
Please? I'm not kidding.

21:46.348 --> 21:48.933
Viktor Cherevin is
completely unpredictable.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.436
And it's Russia.

21:51.519 --> 21:54.230
Insider trading is legal over there.
It's the Wild West.

21:54.314 --> 21:57.067
They're still ideologues,
but the new ideology is money.

21:57.368 --> 21:59.128
They're not a country,
they're a corporation.

21:59.152 --> 22:00.403
Which is why
we're there in the first place.

22:00.445 --> 22:02.572
- I know, don't rock the boat.
- It's not a boat.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.033
It's a goddamn luxury yacht
and we're all on it together.

22:05.075 --> 22:06.785
So, don't fucking sink us.

22:08.147 --> 22:09.347
Why don't you want me to come?

22:09.371 --> 22:11.081
Because I think
you'd be bored out of your mind.

22:11.122 --> 22:13.667
It's Moscow. How would I be bored?

22:13.750 --> 22:15.669
I'll be working the whole time.

22:15.919 --> 22:17.420
What about Paris?

22:18.088 --> 22:19.881
- What about Paris?
- Well, it isn't boring.

22:20.423 --> 22:21.800
And you won't be working.

22:22.175 --> 22:25.011
They owe me a long weekend. You can
meet me there when you're done.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.433
What do I have
to do to take a vacation with you?

22:30.934 --> 22:32.811
You can marry me
and call it a honeymoon.

22:33.812 --> 22:35.897
Why didn't you tell me about the movie?

22:36.481 --> 22:37.482
What?

22:38.566 --> 22:40.276
<i>Sorry, Wrong Number.</i>
You'd already seen it.

22:40.318 --> 22:41.778
There was a stub in your pocket.

22:42.112 --> 22:43.446
You went through my pockets.

22:44.781 --> 22:47.242
I folded your pants
because you throw them on the floor

22:47.283 --> 22:49.763
- and what I asked you...
- Why won't you just marry me, Cathy?

22:50.078 --> 22:51.746
Are you having an affair?

22:52.789 --> 22:54.791
Oh, God, no. No.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.501
Is that what this is?
Is that what you think?

22:56.530 --> 22:57.770
Who did you see the movie with?

22:57.794 --> 22:59.337
By myself.

22:59.421 --> 23:02.966
I'm a compliance officer.
I do everything by myself!

23:03.008 --> 23:04.134
It was a 1:45 show.

23:04.175 --> 23:05.927
I couldn't stare at
the goddamn computer screen anymore.

23:05.969 --> 23:09.472
You know what? If the job isn't right for
you, Jack, maybe it's time to move on!

23:23.987 --> 23:25.238
Paris.

23:26.573 --> 23:27.824
You and me.

23:29.242 --> 23:30.577
Okay?

23:53.850 --> 23:55.935
Dr. Ryan. Embee Deng.

23:56.019 --> 23:57.687
Private security for Cherevin Group.

23:58.188 --> 24:00.190
I'm your protective detail.

24:00.857 --> 24:01.941
I need a bodyguard?

24:02.067 --> 24:05.445
Think of me as your fancy driver.

24:10.658 --> 24:12.786
- Where are you from, Embee?
- Uganda.

24:12.869 --> 24:15.121
Cherevin only hires foreigners
for security.

24:15.205 --> 24:18.625
That way they know we're not FSB.

24:19.709 --> 24:22.170
Good afternoon, good afternoon.

24:29.302 --> 24:30.970
This way, Mr. Deng.

24:47.570 --> 24:50.490
Wow, St. Basil's Cathedral. Beautiful.

24:50.657 --> 24:53.660
It looks like ice cream. Ice cream top.

25:03.044 --> 25:04.963
Ah, you speak some Russian.

25:08.717 --> 25:11.428
You go and register.
I'll help you upstairs with the bags.

25:11.469 --> 25:12.804
No. That's okay. I can get it from here.

25:12.887 --> 25:14.514
I'm supposed to check the room.

25:14.597 --> 25:15.724
Okay.

25:17.100 --> 25:18.977
- Welcome, Mr. Ryan.
- Hi.

25:20.103 --> 25:22.772
- Just your signature, please.
- All right.

25:37.454 --> 25:40.915
Mr. Cherevin hopes
the room will be to your satisfaction.

25:46.129 --> 25:49.632
Ah, yes. And the view is second to none.

25:51.134 --> 25:52.635
Wow.

25:56.348 --> 25:57.474
It's magnificent!

29:11.001 --> 29:12.627
This is Cornerback. I have a situation.

29:12.669 --> 29:13.962
<i>You have 85 seconds.</i>

29:14.295 --> 29:15.755
- I need help.<i>
- Category?</i>

29:15.922 --> 29:17.340
Somebody tried to kill me.
There's a body.

29:17.424 --> 29:18.508
<i>Are you intact?</i>

29:18.717 --> 29:20.010
Close enough.

29:20.176 --> 29:22.387
<i>Location?</i>

29:22.470 --> 29:23.763
<i>Cornerback?</i>

29:23.847 --> 29:26.683
The Grushnitsky Hotel, Moscow.

29:28.810 --> 29:29.936
Oh, no.

29:30.478 --> 29:32.063
<i>15 to 20 minutes.</i>

29:32.188 --> 29:35.233
<i>Maintain the room.
Wait for two rings, then exit.</i>

29:35.734 --> 29:39.112
<i>Go quiet until 21:30 local
and surface at location Gamma.</i>

29:39.195 --> 29:40.447
I...

29:40.530 --> 29:42.532
<i>Contact bench at the base of the stairs.</i>

29:42.615 --> 29:45.869
I don't remember where that is.

29:47.037 --> 29:48.038
<i>Confirm.</i>

29:48.079 --> 29:51.332
I heard you, I just don't
remember the address, okay?

29:51.499 --> 29:54.085
I'm just an analyst.
I only did three weeks at the Farm.

29:54.169 --> 29:56.171
<i>You are breaking protocol, Cornerback.</i>

29:56.212 --> 29:58.506
I'm out of my goddamn element
is what I am.

29:58.548 --> 30:00.133
I just need the address.

30:00.216 --> 30:03.053
<i>Go back to your room and stay
there until the phone rings twice.</i>

30:03.094 --> 30:04.929
<i>Then leave quickly and quietly.</i>

30:05.013 --> 30:07.182
<i>Keep out of sight until 9:30 local time.</i>

30:07.223 --> 30:09.392
<i>- Then, go to Staraya Square, the steps.</i>
- Okay.

30:09.476 --> 30:11.853
<i>Your contact will be on the bench.</i>

30:11.895 --> 30:13.229
<i>Cornerback?</i>

30:13.313 --> 30:14.439
Yeah.

30:14.981 --> 30:16.107
<i>You're a Marine.</i>

30:16.191 --> 30:18.735
<i>It's the reason
you're still alive right now.</i>

30:18.860 --> 30:21.738
<i>Remember your tradecraft
and you'll be fine.</i>

30:23.448 --> 30:24.783
Thank you.

30:24.908 --> 30:26.034
<i>Time's up.</i>

32:07.427 --> 32:09.012
Hey, I was just about to call you.

32:09.095 --> 32:10.138
<i>Hey.</i>

32:10.180 --> 32:12.349
Yeah, I only landed
a couple hours ago, so...

32:12.432 --> 32:15.185
<i>Oh, good.
I'm not trying to hassle you, I just...</i>

32:15.560 --> 32:17.979
<i>I just wanted to make sure
the trip was okay.</i>

32:18.021 --> 32:20.357
Yeah. Yeah, it was,
you know, uneventful.

32:20.690 --> 32:23.401
Well, that's the best kind.

32:23.610 --> 32:24.778
<i>So, what are you doing now?</i>

32:24.903 --> 32:27.530
I just left the hotel. Gonna...

32:28.031 --> 32:29.908
Got to go meet a colleague.

32:30.367 --> 32:31.493
Anybody interesting?

32:31.993 --> 32:35.538
I don't think you know him.
What are you up to?

32:35.955 --> 32:38.375
<i>Well, I was just on call for a 48,</i>

32:38.416 --> 32:42.253
<i>but Saidelman says
that he can cover me for the weekend.</i>

32:43.421 --> 32:45.173
<i>So I thought,</i>

32:45.215 --> 32:48.635
if I got on a plane tonight,
I could be in Paris in the morning.

32:48.968 --> 32:50.368
You think you could get away early?

32:56.101 --> 32:57.185
Hello?

32:57.977 --> 33:00.230
Yeah, you know, I...

33:02.732 --> 33:04.401
<i>I don't think so, Cath.</i>

33:04.442 --> 33:06.736
<i>I think I'm gonna be
tied up longer than I thought.</i>

33:06.778 --> 33:07.946
I'm not...

33:09.531 --> 33:12.617
I'm not sure
I'm gonna be able to make it there at all.

33:13.868 --> 33:16.329
Well, it sounds like you're having fun.

33:16.663 --> 33:18.540
Look, sweetheart, I'm...

33:19.124 --> 33:21.751
I'm late and I'm tired.
I'm pretty jetlagged.

33:21.876 --> 33:23.677
Can I give you a call
in the morning, my time?

33:24.546 --> 33:25.755
Okay.

33:29.718 --> 33:32.429
I love you desperately.
You know that, don't you?

33:33.263 --> 33:34.431
Yep.

33:35.890 --> 33:37.434
Don't lose faith in me.

33:41.146 --> 33:42.272
Okay.

34:11.551 --> 34:12.802
You okay?

34:15.138 --> 34:16.348
Sit down.

34:20.476 --> 34:23.563
You got to pick somebody to trust, Jack.
Now, sit down.

34:34.866 --> 34:35.949
You brought your dog?

34:38.786 --> 34:40.538
Q.P. dog.

34:40.663 --> 34:43.833
Quasi-Personal.
Why else am I out for a walk?

34:44.617 --> 34:45.978
Grabbed it out of somebody's yard.

34:46.002 --> 34:48.797
They'll be thrilled when
he turns up in the morning.

34:52.425 --> 34:55.136
It's better they're shaking
afterwards than during.

35:02.268 --> 35:04.979
First person I ever killed,
Jack, was innocent.

35:06.731 --> 35:09.192
- What did he do?
- She.

35:11.361 --> 35:14.114
She didn't do anything.
She was a bystander.

35:15.323 --> 35:16.908
Somebody who just...

35:18.284 --> 35:20.745
Just came up behind me too quick.

35:21.621 --> 35:22.747
Jesus.

35:23.289 --> 35:25.375
How do you get over
something like that?

35:26.042 --> 35:28.044
If you're lucky, you get past it.

35:30.130 --> 35:32.507
- That's not the same thing.
- No, it isn't.

35:32.549 --> 35:35.301
Now talk me through
your very scary memo,

35:36.469 --> 35:40.181
but keep in mind I don't have your Ph.D.

35:42.225 --> 35:44.394
Two weeks ago, I noticed
a series of accounts

35:44.436 --> 35:45.979
in our Russian partner's records

35:46.062 --> 35:49.149
to which our company's
computers are denied access.

35:49.566 --> 35:51.651
Massive currency accounts,

35:52.110 --> 35:54.070
all in U.S. Treasuries.

35:55.238 --> 35:57.741
Cherevin's made a total
commitment to U.S. dollars

35:57.824 --> 35:59.951
when there's been
a hurricane in the Gulf

36:00.035 --> 36:02.454
and a string of negative
economic reports.

36:03.788 --> 36:04.789
What does it mean?

36:04.914 --> 36:06.666
It's external sterilized intervention.

36:06.833 --> 36:08.293
Like I'm an idiot, please?

36:08.418 --> 36:11.755
The dollar should be
going down, but it's up.

36:12.130 --> 36:14.424
A few cents every day, the past week.

36:15.759 --> 36:17.135
I think they're propping us up.

36:17.886 --> 36:18.928
Why?

36:21.264 --> 36:24.434
I think there's
a coordinated plot within Russia

36:25.268 --> 36:27.687
to collapse the dollar
and crash the U.S. economy.

36:27.771 --> 36:30.023
And it's going to happen soon.

36:30.815 --> 36:34.027
It'll be timed to
follow a terrorist attack on U.S. soil.

36:34.110 --> 36:35.862
No, that'd be crazy.
The Russians would lose

36:35.945 --> 36:37.822
- as much as anybody in a collapse.
- No. No, no, no,

36:37.906 --> 36:40.075
the Chinese will lose more.

36:40.450 --> 36:41.910
And once the Russians start to sell,

36:41.951 --> 36:45.455
the rest of the world
is gonna dump every dollar they have.

36:47.916 --> 36:50.460
All right, let's say it's happened.
Let's say you're right.

36:50.543 --> 36:52.295
What's the aftermath?

36:52.545 --> 36:53.630
They'll recover.

36:54.297 --> 36:57.425
We won't.
We don't have their oil reserves.

36:58.176 --> 37:00.053
We're looking at the Panic of 1837,

37:00.136 --> 37:03.348
the Panic of 1893,
the Soviet Famine of 1932.

37:03.431 --> 37:04.516
Hyperinflation.

37:04.599 --> 37:06.935
Bread lines. Rioting.

37:06.976 --> 37:08.311
I know, I get it.

37:09.051 --> 37:11.332
And at first, though,
they'll call it the American crisis,

37:11.356 --> 37:14.117
but within about six weeks,
they're gonna start calling it what it is.

37:17.737 --> 37:19.280
The Second Great Depression.

37:21.825 --> 37:24.327
The attack and the sell-off have to be
timed to each other.

37:25.161 --> 37:26.955
A massive series
of transactions like that

37:26.996 --> 37:28.456
have to be programmed in advance

37:28.498 --> 37:30.291
and stored in Cherevin's system.

37:30.917 --> 37:32.597
Once I start the audit, I can get the date

37:32.669 --> 37:34.629
and time of the attack
down to the minute.

37:41.511 --> 37:43.513
You stick to
the scheduled audit tomorrow.

37:44.139 --> 37:46.141
Everything official, everything in public.

37:46.641 --> 37:47.767
You'll be fine.

37:49.227 --> 37:51.021
I need for you to be fine.

37:53.064 --> 37:56.818
Your room should be clean by now.
We'll put a watch on it.

37:58.403 --> 37:59.821
I drowned him.

38:02.532 --> 38:04.242
In about that much water.

38:08.538 --> 38:11.082
You know, you sold this as an office job.

38:20.717 --> 38:22.802
You're not just an analyst anymore.

38:24.054 --> 38:25.555
You're operational now.

42:05.400 --> 42:07.944
Hi. Jack Ryan to see Mr. Cherevin.

42:08.028 --> 42:10.947
- One moment, please.
- Dr. Ryan? I'm Katya,

42:11.114 --> 42:13.783
Mr. Cherevin's assistant.
He's expecting you.

42:47.525 --> 42:49.694
I may be here a few days.
Will I get my own card?

42:49.861 --> 42:53.406
As a foreign guest,
you'll need to be accompanied.

42:54.324 --> 42:55.700
You understand?

42:56.701 --> 42:57.786
Of course.

43:27.482 --> 43:28.817
Viktor Cherevin.

43:28.942 --> 43:30.026
Jack Ryan.

43:30.902 --> 43:33.697
- How was your flight?
- Fine, thank you.

43:34.072 --> 43:35.699
And the jet lag?

43:38.702 --> 43:40.704
That first night can be brutal.

43:42.205 --> 43:43.456
I survived.

43:44.916 --> 43:47.877
That's a nice painting. Napoleon at war.

43:48.378 --> 43:50.046
So, you know your history.

43:50.630 --> 43:52.007
What can I do for you?

43:52.841 --> 43:54.050
Routine audit.

43:54.509 --> 43:56.761
So routine it couldn't
be done from New York?

43:57.387 --> 43:59.889
Not when you're
concealing accounts from us.

44:02.475 --> 44:05.562
You Americans like to think
of yourselves as direct.

44:05.854 --> 44:08.189
But I wonder if perhaps
you are just rude.

44:10.525 --> 44:12.318
You Russians think
of yourselves as poets,

44:12.402 --> 44:14.654
but perhaps you're just touchy.

44:19.242 --> 44:22.037
Nothing here is concealed.
Only secured.

44:24.539 --> 44:25.790
Excuse me.

44:29.502 --> 44:32.422
I hope I can count on
full access to your account files?

44:33.089 --> 44:34.341
You won't need it.

44:34.966 --> 44:37.010
I ordered the companies
which concerned you,

44:37.093 --> 44:38.636
quite unnecessarily, I might add,

44:38.720 --> 44:40.597
to be sold, at a profit.

44:40.638 --> 44:42.849
Your firm's percentages
are detailed in this report.

44:42.932 --> 44:44.309
The funds were
transferred this morning,

44:44.392 --> 44:46.603
too late, alas,
to stop you from getting on your flight.

44:46.644 --> 44:48.396
So, you see, an audit would be

44:48.438 --> 44:50.899
quite without purpose
at this point, Mr. Ryan.

44:52.609 --> 44:53.777
I see.

44:54.944 --> 44:57.238
Partnerships are delicate, Mr. Ryan.

44:58.490 --> 45:00.450
Sometimes, they end violently.

45:01.576 --> 45:03.787
Dimitri Lemkov, our head of security.

45:04.496 --> 45:05.622
Jack Ryan.

45:08.291 --> 45:11.169
I'm sorry you had to come all this
way for nothing, Mr. Ryan.

45:16.716 --> 45:18.968
I hear the finest restaurant

45:19.010 --> 45:21.971
in Moscow is across the street.

45:23.973 --> 45:26.810
In honor of our partnership
and to, quite frankly,

45:26.851 --> 45:29.854
apologize for my mistake,

45:30.647 --> 45:32.232
perhaps I could take you to dinner.

45:33.650 --> 45:34.693
No.

45:35.944 --> 45:37.112
But I'll take you.

45:37.987 --> 45:40.699
And I insist my driver
pick you up from your hotel.

45:41.032 --> 45:42.992
Moscow can be very dangerous.

45:43.326 --> 45:44.994
Our own man, for example,

45:45.036 --> 45:47.664
who collected you from the airport.
Embee.

45:47.914 --> 45:51.668
We are very concerned.
He has simply disappeared.

45:51.876 --> 45:53.003
I'm sorry to hear that.

45:53.128 --> 45:55.672
No doubt he will turn up in a day or two,

45:55.839 --> 45:57.757
hung-over and remorseful.

45:58.008 --> 46:00.301
Will your wife be joining us tonight?

46:03.930 --> 46:05.473
I'm not married.

46:05.849 --> 46:09.310
I was just told that
she had arrived at your hotel.

46:10.520 --> 46:11.938
My girlfriend.

46:12.022 --> 46:13.898
Even better, and our little secret.

46:15.400 --> 46:16.693
You're having fun with me.

46:16.860 --> 46:19.571
Not nearly enough. Bring her along
tonight. We won't go otherwise.

46:20.113 --> 46:21.573
I'll be sure to ask.

46:22.866 --> 46:24.451
A pleasure to have met you both.

47:06.159 --> 47:07.577
You're done already?

47:07.660 --> 47:08.703
He's outplayed us.

47:08.745 --> 47:10.246
You didn't get anything?

47:10.997 --> 47:13.458
Nothing. Not one thing.

47:14.209 --> 47:16.503
He sold all the assets.

47:17.003 --> 47:19.172
He probably moved them
to other shell companies.

47:19.255 --> 47:21.424
But I can't audit
what they technically don't own.

47:22.425 --> 47:24.761
- All right. We still need the algorithm.
- Yeah.

47:26.596 --> 47:28.473
Yeah. I invited him to dinner.

47:29.391 --> 47:32.018
The restaurant is across
the street from his building.

47:33.478 --> 47:35.146
What if we...

47:36.439 --> 47:37.691
What if what?

47:37.713 --> 47:38.834
- I don't know.
- What, Jack?

47:38.858 --> 47:40.110
Well, what if we...

47:40.235 --> 47:41.444
You wanna break into their system?

47:41.528 --> 47:43.113
- Yeah, I think someone should.
- You think we can?

47:43.154 --> 47:44.531
Yeah... I don't know.

47:44.614 --> 47:46.116
Put it up, the restaurant.

47:46.157 --> 47:48.076
The orders to sell the dollar would be

47:48.118 --> 47:50.495
encrypted on the computer
of the security director.

47:50.870 --> 47:52.205
Dimitri Lemkov?

47:52.747 --> 47:54.332
Former FSB.

47:54.416 --> 47:55.792
We can't break into his office.

47:55.875 --> 47:57.293
It's secured six different ways.

47:57.335 --> 47:59.045
So, what about the office next to his?

47:59.587 --> 48:00.797
Well, that's Cherevin's.

48:00.839 --> 48:01.965
Can we get into that?

48:02.048 --> 48:05.969
Maybe someone could
if they had his access card.

48:06.052 --> 48:09.097
We're developing a security guard,
but we don't have him yet.

48:09.139 --> 48:10.473
Well, develop harder.

48:12.892 --> 48:14.144
He drinks, right?

48:14.227 --> 48:15.520
Like a Russian.

48:16.146 --> 48:19.399
Also chases women.
The more married, the better.

48:22.318 --> 48:24.779
Okay, tell your guy once he's in there,

48:24.904 --> 48:28.950
he needs to enable all encrypted
financial sell order packages.

48:29.075 --> 48:31.327
Tell him to look
for dark pool algorithms.

48:31.953 --> 48:34.205
And if your guy, if the guy...

48:38.752 --> 48:40.378
I'm the guy, aren't I?

48:40.962 --> 48:43.798
Yeah. You're going to be great.

48:44.799 --> 48:46.676
But you've got another problem, Jack.

48:57.812 --> 48:59.189
So I dropped everything,

48:59.481 --> 49:01.941
and I called in every favor that I knew

49:02.025 --> 49:05.487
and I spent four hours
at the consulate begging for a visa.

49:05.737 --> 49:08.740
You know,
I wanted to make this grand gesture.

49:08.823 --> 49:11.034
I wanted you to see
what you meant to me.

49:11.117 --> 49:13.411
So, I'm here.

49:14.079 --> 49:16.414
And you have to say something.

49:17.374 --> 49:22.128
Well, maybe it's...
Maybe it's awful or hurtful or shameful.

49:22.462 --> 49:26.091
I don't know. But you have to talk to me.

49:27.467 --> 49:29.678
You can't let me think
that I'm crazy anymore.

49:31.262 --> 49:33.390
Because now I know that I'm not.

49:35.892 --> 49:37.394
Just talk to me.

49:39.396 --> 49:40.939
Will you meet me halfway?

49:53.118 --> 49:54.703
I'm in the CIA.

49:58.623 --> 50:00.041
Thank God.

50:03.837 --> 50:06.047
I thought you were having an affair.

50:43.710 --> 50:45.879
And this must be Aleksandr.

50:45.962 --> 50:47.589
The prodigal returns.

50:47.964 --> 50:51.718
He may not be a regular churchgoer,
but he's a good man, my son.

50:51.801 --> 50:53.595
He just turned 21.

50:53.636 --> 50:56.389
And he already
has a job at the auto plant.

52:18.388 --> 52:20.974
<i>Playing the hottest music in Detroit.</i>

52:21.057 --> 52:22.976
<i>Feel the heat now.</i>

52:45.582 --> 52:46.750
Hey.

52:47.334 --> 52:48.335
Hey.

52:48.418 --> 52:49.419
Excuse me.

52:50.587 --> 52:51.838
You look kind of lost.

53:19.449 --> 53:23.203
So, I'll have to
keep him busy at the table for what?

53:23.286 --> 53:24.788
Ten minutes? To be on the safe side?

53:24.913 --> 53:26.122
What are you talking about?
You're not going.

53:26.164 --> 53:27.749
You said he insisted I come to dinner.

53:27.791 --> 53:30.085
- It'll look suspicious if I don't show up.
- No, no, it won't.

53:30.126 --> 53:31.127
She's right, Jack.

53:31.211 --> 53:32.462
To him, something will be off.

53:32.545 --> 53:33.672
You're not involving her in this.

53:33.755 --> 53:35.965
You involved me in this
by not telling me.

53:36.049 --> 53:37.175
You got to get her out of here.
Send her home.

53:37.258 --> 53:38.927
Well, what are you gonna tell Cherevin?
That I'm homesick?

53:38.968 --> 53:41.304
These are dangerous people, Cathy.
You cannot be here.

53:41.388 --> 53:43.431
If you'd told me who you really were,
I wouldn't be.

53:43.473 --> 53:44.641
I took an oath!

53:45.100 --> 53:46.393
I took an oath.

53:46.476 --> 53:48.186
I couldn't tell you
unless we were married.

53:48.269 --> 53:50.188
- And you wouldn't marry me!
- That's why you wanted to marry me,

53:50.271 --> 53:51.356
so that you could tell somebody

53:51.439 --> 53:52.482
- that you were in the CIA?
- No, of course not.

53:52.524 --> 53:54.734
You lied to me for three years
and you were good at it.

53:54.818 --> 53:56.236
I think you actually enjoyed it.

53:56.319 --> 53:58.363
Can we have a minute, please?

53:58.446 --> 53:59.614
No, you can't.

53:59.656 --> 54:01.199
I would like to talk to Jack alone.

54:01.282 --> 54:03.785
This is geopolitics,
it's not couples therapy.

54:06.871 --> 54:09.666
Do I really have to remind you
what's at stake here, Jack?

54:10.208 --> 54:13.545
There's a very real scenario here
where we don't get out of this alive.

54:16.131 --> 54:17.424
Any of us.

54:18.008 --> 54:20.010
And neither do a lot
of innocent people back home.

54:20.093 --> 54:23.013
Now, we had about
eight minutes to discuss this little...

54:23.763 --> 54:26.016
This little development.
We just used four of them.

54:26.349 --> 54:28.893
We don't need you to break
into Lemkov's computer,

54:29.019 --> 54:30.437
just into the office next to his.

54:30.520 --> 54:32.397
You plug this into any 220 outlet

54:32.480 --> 54:34.107
that shares the same wall with him.

54:34.190 --> 54:37.861
We use the building's own electrical
wiring to access Lemkov's hard drive.

54:37.986 --> 54:40.739
How much time will he need
to run the program?

54:40.822 --> 54:43.033
Five, six minutes, including movement.

54:43.116 --> 54:45.326
So the answer to your question, yes.

54:45.452 --> 54:47.537
10 minutes at the table ought to do it.

54:49.205 --> 54:50.540
All right.

54:50.582 --> 54:52.876
You know, we catch a few breaks,
we can all be

54:53.001 --> 54:55.170
headed home on a plane by midnight.

54:55.211 --> 54:57.505
Cherevin will be at dinner in...

54:57.547 --> 54:59.716
- Cathy.
- 55 minutes.

55:00.175 --> 55:01.968
- Then I should get dressed.
- Cathy.

55:08.350 --> 55:09.476
I like her.

55:10.143 --> 55:12.270
If Cherevin touches her, I'll kill him.

55:12.896 --> 55:14.647
It's just dinner, Jack.

55:15.440 --> 55:17.275
The most he can do is look.

55:18.026 --> 55:19.903
And to be honest, we need him to.

55:47.263 --> 55:49.766
- Good morning.
- Morning.

55:53.436 --> 55:55.438
Do you know what happened
three years ago today?

55:56.564 --> 55:58.483
You agreed to stop
wearing cargo shorts?

55:58.733 --> 56:01.861
I did. I did, it broke my heart.

56:02.404 --> 56:05.281
All that storage capacity.
Incredible. Incredible shorts.

56:05.615 --> 56:07.784
No, but once I did

56:07.826 --> 56:09.828
agree to make pants
a part of the new me,

56:09.911 --> 56:12.622
you finally agreed to go out with me.

56:12.831 --> 56:15.291
Well, I couldn't very well
date a patient, could I?

56:16.960 --> 56:18.461
Could you marry one?

56:22.382 --> 56:24.134
'Cause I'm in love with you, Doctor.

56:32.934 --> 56:34.436
Oh, my God.

56:46.448 --> 56:49.284
I'd appreciate it if you would wear
the ring in public.

56:53.371 --> 56:55.957
I left it in the hotel room.

56:57.334 --> 56:58.501
I know.

56:59.502 --> 57:00.754
I found it.

57:04.632 --> 57:07.802
He's expecting to meet my fiancÃ©e.
And this is

57:09.387 --> 57:11.890
his driver.
So please don't embarrass me.

57:44.047 --> 57:46.216
Ah, the Ryans.

57:46.257 --> 57:49.010
Perfect American couple. Welcome.

57:49.469 --> 57:52.430
Viktor Cherevin, my fiancÃ©e, Dr. Muller.

57:52.681 --> 57:55.642
Dr. Muller, you are so beautiful.

58:09.489 --> 58:10.907
Lemkov's headed out.

58:17.163 --> 58:19.207
Jack, it's show time.

58:21.793 --> 58:25.088
I hope you will enjoy the Haut-Brion.
It's a very special wine.

58:28.258 --> 58:30.552
You find it amusing.

58:32.595 --> 58:33.847
Jack had an early start.

58:33.930 --> 58:35.015
So it seems.

58:38.309 --> 58:40.603
Hey. Can I get another one of these?

58:40.687 --> 58:43.314
This is good, Viktor.

58:46.735 --> 58:48.611
Jack has a back injury.

58:50.113 --> 58:51.364
From Afghanistan.

58:51.823 --> 58:53.116
Me, too.

58:53.491 --> 58:55.994
Different time, different empire,
same graveyard.

58:56.786 --> 58:58.997
- My son's, also.
- Sorry to hear that.

58:59.748 --> 59:03.084
Mujahideen grenade fragment
is lodged in my hip to this day.

59:03.209 --> 59:05.420
I wouldn't think a hand grenade

59:05.462 --> 59:07.672
would be the first thing
you'd wanna keep on your desk.

59:07.756 --> 59:09.215
A reminder of a vanquished rival.

59:09.507 --> 59:11.593
- You lost the war.
- But I beat your grenade.

59:11.760 --> 59:12.802
My grenade?

59:12.886 --> 59:14.846
One supplied by your CIA.

59:19.017 --> 59:20.143
Perhaps.

59:20.685 --> 59:21.853
Perhaps.

59:24.522 --> 59:28.234
Well, I'm no medical doctor
like my illustrious fiancÃ©e here,

59:28.318 --> 59:30.904
but I would recommend
a Percocet or three for that hip.

59:30.987 --> 59:33.239
With a nice, hearty red like this,

59:33.323 --> 59:35.575
you won't know
your own name in an hour.

59:36.284 --> 59:38.286
What? Come on,
don't give me that look, Cathy.

59:38.328 --> 59:40.830
I'm not gonna be policed
at the dinner table.

59:42.082 --> 59:43.500
Do you want one?

59:43.792 --> 59:45.710
- I think not.
- Are you sure?

59:46.294 --> 59:47.671
Oh, I'm sure.

59:50.507 --> 59:52.509
You are so attractive like this.

59:52.676 --> 59:53.843
Chin-chin.

59:53.885 --> 59:55.303
Will you excuse me, please?

59:58.890 --> 01:00:00.809
Jack, I speak no Russian.

01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:02.644
Is it too much to ask to be escorted?

01:00:02.686 --> 01:00:05.146
Oh, it's just the bathroom, Cathy.
It's just the bathroom.

01:00:05.188 --> 01:00:07.148
- Please. Allow me.
- Thank you.

01:00:07.816 --> 01:00:09.192
<i>Nice work, Jack.</i>

01:00:29.421 --> 01:00:30.630
I got it.

01:00:31.047 --> 01:00:32.257
Okay.

01:00:35.844 --> 01:00:36.845
<i>Exit.</i>

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:38.471
Snowball is rolling.

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.891
Okay to go.

01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:43.184
<i>Step it up.</i>

01:00:45.395 --> 01:00:46.646
Viktor!

01:00:47.856 --> 01:00:49.524
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor. Tell me.

01:00:49.566 --> 01:00:51.651
Which would you rather? Pick one.

01:00:52.277 --> 01:00:55.739
Either you live in some
miserable shithole, you have no money,

01:00:56.364 --> 01:00:57.574
but you're single.

01:00:58.575 --> 01:01:02.370
Or you're rich,
you live in some fantastic apartment,

01:01:02.412 --> 01:01:04.497
but you have to be, good God,

01:01:04.581 --> 01:01:07.667
you have to be in a relationship.

01:01:10.545 --> 01:01:12.172
What do you think?

01:01:13.506 --> 01:01:16.092
- I'll leave the night to the two of you.
- I won't allow it.

01:01:16.634 --> 01:01:18.887
I think one of us needs to take a walk.

01:01:20.138 --> 01:01:22.474
I think you should
consider her suggestion.

01:01:39.157 --> 01:01:41.034
Please, sit down.

01:02:39.426 --> 01:02:40.510
He's in.

01:02:56.818 --> 01:02:59.029
You flew all the way to Moscow
to surprise him

01:02:59.112 --> 01:03:01.239
or to catch him, which was it?

01:03:01.781 --> 01:03:03.199
That's a rather personal question.

01:03:03.742 --> 01:03:05.535
Would you prefer impersonal?

01:03:05.618 --> 01:03:08.163
I'd rather talk than make
chit-chat, wouldn't you?

01:03:10.331 --> 01:03:13.012
If we're going to be married,
I'd like to know that I can trust him.

01:03:13.084 --> 01:03:14.169
Trust.

01:03:14.919 --> 01:03:15.962
Truth.

01:03:16.212 --> 01:03:19.049
I think it's like most opinions,
best unexpressed.

01:03:21.468 --> 01:03:23.219
You talk like Pechorin.

01:03:24.387 --> 01:03:26.139
You've read <i>A Hero Of Our Time?</i>

01:03:26.389 --> 01:03:28.224
I had a misspent sophomore year.

01:03:28.266 --> 01:03:29.517
Really?

01:03:29.726 --> 01:03:32.687
I love Lermontov.
That Russian romanticism is so

01:03:34.147 --> 01:03:35.523
achingly desperate.

01:03:35.857 --> 01:03:39.027
Desperate, yes. And insatiable.

01:04:27.867 --> 01:04:31.413
It's about not aging before your time.

01:04:31.454 --> 01:04:34.040
You don't understand.
Aging isn't the problem.

01:04:34.124 --> 01:04:36.459
Dying the proper way,
that is the problem.

01:04:36.501 --> 01:04:38.181
Not if you've lived a life without regret.

01:04:38.211 --> 01:04:40.296
How on earth does one do that?

01:04:40.422 --> 01:04:43.758
Regret. It piles up around us
like books we never read.

01:04:44.551 --> 01:04:46.011
Well, that's the past.

01:04:47.155 --> 01:04:49.115
Can you live the rest
of your life without regret?

01:04:49.139 --> 01:04:52.183
Yes, perhaps.
If I feel I have done something

01:04:52.267 --> 01:04:54.811
truly great for my country.

01:04:56.688 --> 01:04:59.149
Something my children
would have found important.

01:05:02.110 --> 01:05:03.361
Would have?

01:05:05.947 --> 01:05:07.490
You're incredibly beautiful.

01:05:09.534 --> 01:05:12.662
I hope Jack Ryan realizes
how fortunate he is.

01:05:14.497 --> 01:05:15.540
- Ready.<i>
- Okay.</i>

01:05:16.332 --> 01:05:17.334
Go.

01:05:34.184 --> 01:05:35.185
Okay.

01:05:56.289 --> 01:05:57.874
Lemkov's on his way back.

01:05:57.916 --> 01:05:59.501
Okay, you're on the clock.

01:05:59.584 --> 01:06:01.044
Three minutes, 37.

01:06:22.607 --> 01:06:24.526
How advanced is your cirrhosis?

01:06:26.152 --> 01:06:27.487
You have a

01:06:28.822 --> 01:06:31.324
yellow tinge to your skin tone.

01:06:32.075 --> 01:06:34.494
Spider-web veins
on the backs of your hands.

01:06:35.745 --> 01:06:37.664
You're stage three, aren't you?

01:06:41.668 --> 01:06:43.211
You see? Now we're talking.

01:06:44.796 --> 01:06:47.090
- Excuse me.
- No, please take the call.

01:06:51.219 --> 01:06:52.971
They tell me I have
less than three months

01:06:53.054 --> 01:06:54.431
but you probably know that

01:06:54.472 --> 01:06:56.766
because you are clearly
a brilliant doctor.

01:07:08.737 --> 01:07:09.779
Jack.

01:07:09.821 --> 01:07:11.781
<i>Hey, Teddy, it's Jack.
I'm in Cherevin's office</i>

01:07:11.823 --> 01:07:13.908
<i>- and I need your help really quick...</i>
- I'm having dinner with her.

01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:14.951
What?

01:07:15.035 --> 01:07:16.619
Sarah in Arbitrage.

01:07:17.495 --> 01:07:19.956
That's great.
Look, I need a favor, Teddy.

01:07:20.081 --> 01:07:22.834
I'm at Cherevin.
I'm having a little trouble accessing

01:07:23.168 --> 01:07:25.837
a group file code without
a partner-level ABA dodge.

01:07:25.962 --> 01:07:27.380
Can you grab Rob for me?

01:07:27.464 --> 01:07:28.923
<i>I know he's in a meeting right now.</i>

01:07:28.965 --> 01:07:30.717
For you, the world.

01:07:34.387 --> 01:07:35.472
Jack!

01:07:35.638 --> 01:07:36.681
Hey, Rob.

01:07:36.765 --> 01:07:38.475
You find anything juicy over there?

01:07:38.558 --> 01:07:40.685
Oh, you know, accounts bullshit,

01:07:40.769 --> 01:07:42.289
hookers and hotels,
same old, same old.

01:07:42.312 --> 01:07:44.105
Did Teddy tell you I need that dodge?

01:07:44.397 --> 01:07:46.566
I'll give it to you on one condition.

01:07:46.941 --> 01:07:47.984
Shoot.

01:07:48.068 --> 01:07:52.280
If you get one whiff that FSB
is involved in whatever this is,

01:07:52.614 --> 01:07:55.325
<i>you run, do not walk,
to the nearest airport.</i>

01:07:55.992 --> 01:07:57.452
They play rough over there, Jack.

01:07:57.494 --> 01:07:59.496
Under two, Jack. Step it up.

01:07:59.662 --> 01:08:01.623
Understood. Yeah, understood, Rob.

01:08:01.664 --> 01:08:03.083
<i>I worry about you, you know.</i>

01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:06.046
Thanks. I appreciate it. Look, I'm a little
pressed for time on this end.

01:08:06.378 --> 01:08:07.962
- Ready?
- Yeah. Shoot.

01:08:09.839 --> 01:08:12.300
Four... One...

01:08:12.884 --> 01:08:14.052
<i>Seven.</i>

01:08:14.427 --> 01:08:15.679
<i>You getting this?</i>

01:08:15.762 --> 01:08:18.014
<i>One... Eight...</i>

01:08:18.555 --> 01:08:19.849
<i>Three...</i>

01:08:20.015 --> 01:08:21.100
Six.

01:08:28.733 --> 01:08:29.776
Jack?

01:08:30.109 --> 01:08:31.403
We're in.

01:08:31.819 --> 01:08:33.363
I'm not there yet. How we doing?

01:08:33.446 --> 01:08:35.073
Okay, unless he ran the red lights.

01:08:37.367 --> 01:08:38.451
Back on site.

01:08:38.535 --> 01:08:40.203
He ran the red lights. Get out.

01:08:53.383 --> 01:08:54.426
Got it! Got it!

01:09:05.228 --> 01:09:07.439
Jack? You got trouble.

01:09:08.898 --> 01:09:10.399
Oh, my God.

01:09:12.527 --> 01:09:13.737
Oh, my God.

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:16.573
Main elevator is N.G.

01:09:16.698 --> 01:09:18.241
<i>We're working on another exit.</i>

01:09:18.908 --> 01:09:20.243
I need it now.

01:09:20.452 --> 01:09:21.828
Yep, yep, yep.

01:09:22.703 --> 01:09:24.038
There it is. Private elevator.

01:09:24.747 --> 01:09:26.832
Back of Cherevin's office. Go.

01:09:33.756 --> 01:09:35.759
<i>Hit the service entrance button.</i>

01:09:35.841 --> 01:09:39.179
Texting you Cyrillic icon now.

01:09:43.099 --> 01:09:44.934
There's an external staircase.

01:09:53.151 --> 01:09:54.402
Harper.

01:09:54.778 --> 01:09:55.779
Jack.

01:09:57.155 --> 01:09:58.281
Jack.

01:09:59.282 --> 01:10:00.992
Harper. Harper, can you hear me?

01:10:01.409 --> 01:10:02.619
Damn it.

01:10:10.293 --> 01:10:12.420
I'm flushed. Must be the wine.

01:10:12.462 --> 01:10:13.797
Or perhaps the company.

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:16.132
- Are you about to misbehave?
- Would you like me to?

01:10:16.174 --> 01:10:17.550
I haven't decided yet.

01:10:21.513 --> 01:10:22.722
Telephone.

01:10:59.718 --> 01:11:01.011
<i>Jack, stop.</i>

01:11:07.517 --> 01:11:09.060
<i>Hurry up, Jack. He's got Cathy</i>

01:11:09.144 --> 01:11:10.745
<i>and he's on his way
back to the building.</i>

01:11:11.187 --> 01:11:12.313
<i>Duck.</i>

01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:18.028
Keep moving, Jack.

01:11:18.111 --> 01:11:20.321
<i>Staircase is clear to the ground. Go.</i>

01:11:22.157 --> 01:11:23.324
Control, you're on.

01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:02.947
Cathy.

01:12:05.492 --> 01:12:06.743
I'm so sorry.

01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:09.579
Did you enjoy your walk, Dr. Ryan?

01:12:09.662 --> 01:12:12.248
Mr. Cherevin, I have to apologize.
I had too much to drink.

01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:13.541
Excuse me, Doctor!

01:12:13.583 --> 01:12:14.668
- Yes?
- Yes?

01:12:15.919 --> 01:12:17.003
Viktor.

01:12:19.923 --> 01:12:21.091
What is this?

01:12:29.766 --> 01:12:32.769
You missed a fascinating
conversation I had with Dr. Muller.

01:12:34.312 --> 01:12:36.064
I did? What was that?

01:12:36.147 --> 01:12:37.607
Things we regret.

01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:40.443
Let's you and I
have that same talk soon.

01:12:40.944 --> 01:12:43.738
You know, we should get home.
I am so sorry about tonight.

01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:57.127
Get us to Beta.

01:12:57.252 --> 01:12:59.087
<i>Copy that. Let's hit the safe house.</i>

01:12:59.129 --> 01:13:01.169
<i>We clean the premises
and get the hell out of there.</i>

01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:07.303
I have max-level data
coming in for analysis now.

01:14:21.044 --> 01:14:23.088
The algorithm's uploading to Langley.

01:14:23.213 --> 01:14:24.214
Once we break it down...

01:14:24.339 --> 01:14:25.465
It's tomorrow.

01:14:27.133 --> 01:14:28.885
- What?
- The sell order.

01:14:29.177 --> 01:14:32.389
It's programmed for 9:06 a.m. Eastern
Time. They're dumping everywhere.

01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:34.724
Tokyo, London, Shanghai,
a dozen other exchanges.

01:14:34.766 --> 01:14:36.726
It's almost two trillion.
It's gonna be a wipeout.

01:14:36.976 --> 01:14:38.353
That's 18 hours.

01:14:39.896 --> 01:14:41.147
How do we stop it?

01:14:41.231 --> 01:14:44.526
They're not gonna flood the market
unless the terror attack is successful.

01:14:44.567 --> 01:14:45.860
They'd lose everything.

01:14:46.236 --> 01:14:48.613
And the attack
will be coordinated right before that,

01:14:48.697 --> 01:14:50.448
9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

01:15:03.169 --> 01:15:04.295
Get down!

01:15:07.298 --> 01:15:08.591
Go, go, go!

01:15:08.758 --> 01:15:11.011
Albatross, we are compromised
at rendezvous Beta.

01:15:11.094 --> 01:15:12.429
Request immediate backup.

01:15:20.770 --> 01:15:22.147
No! Get off me!

01:15:23.523 --> 01:15:24.566
Get off me!

01:15:24.607 --> 01:15:25.650
Jack!

01:15:25.984 --> 01:15:27.027
Cathy!

01:15:32.157 --> 01:15:33.283
Jack!

01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:35.035
Jack!

01:16:10.153 --> 01:16:11.433
I don't know what you're saying.

01:16:13.114 --> 01:16:14.115
Harper.

01:16:14.157 --> 01:16:15.992
Harper, can you hear me?
Do you have her?

01:16:16.076 --> 01:16:17.827
Are you sure she's wearing it?

01:16:17.911 --> 01:16:19.996
Yes! Of course! I put it on her myself!

01:16:20.205 --> 01:16:21.998
We played the whole scene
for the driver.

01:16:22.082 --> 01:16:23.375
Now where is she?

01:16:29.172 --> 01:16:30.340
Got her.

01:16:30.507 --> 01:16:31.758
It's working.

01:16:31.841 --> 01:16:33.677
<i>Jack, send me a ping from yours.</i>

01:16:36.262 --> 01:16:39.599
Southwest on Kashirskoye Shosse.
It's a kilometer from you.

01:16:48.024 --> 01:16:49.734
Go! Go!

01:17:08.211 --> 01:17:09.212
<i>Off the highway.</i>

01:17:09.254 --> 01:17:11.381
Headed north toward Kuznetsky Most.

01:17:11.464 --> 01:17:13.383
Third exit ahead of you, due north.

01:17:32.944 --> 01:17:34.696
I hope you enjoyed your meal.

01:17:42.370 --> 01:17:43.413
Cathy.

01:17:43.705 --> 01:17:46.207
I hope for her sake
you have not yet transmitted

01:17:46.249 --> 01:17:48.251
the information you stole from me.

01:17:48.835 --> 01:17:51.755
I'm going to find you.
I'm going to find you.

01:17:54.257 --> 01:17:55.383
How far?

01:17:55.425 --> 01:17:57.594
Nine blocks behind him and closing.

01:17:58.762 --> 01:18:01.598
We haven't started transmitting yet.
I still have the stick drive.

01:18:04.768 --> 01:18:06.686
Very good, very good, Jack.

01:18:06.770 --> 01:18:09.564
Let us hope Cathy and I can believe you.

01:18:09.606 --> 01:18:12.776
If not, I have always found
that in these situations

01:18:12.859 --> 01:18:15.945
the swiftest results are achieved
by working with loved ones.

01:18:16.446 --> 01:18:19.115
You know I have what you want.
Put her on the phone!

01:18:19.449 --> 01:18:20.658
Doctor?

01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:21.951
<i>Cathy!</i>

01:18:21.993 --> 01:18:23.328
Talk to your fiancÃ©.

01:18:23.536 --> 01:18:24.996
Cathy, talk to me!

01:18:26.373 --> 01:18:28.458
What? You think your...

01:18:28.792 --> 01:18:32.420
Silence is in some way heroic?

01:18:36.257 --> 01:18:37.425
Cathy!

01:18:37.467 --> 01:18:39.552
We will do this other way.

01:18:41.846 --> 01:18:45.183
So let me tell you something, Jack.

01:18:47.894 --> 01:18:52.565
If you squeeze a neck just right,

01:18:53.692 --> 01:18:56.111
human beings can't keep
their mouths closed.

01:18:59.155 --> 01:19:00.323
<i>Jack.</i>

01:19:00.365 --> 01:19:03.159
A light bulb will go into her mouth

01:19:03.535 --> 01:19:05.120
because in

01:19:05.203 --> 01:19:06.955
<i>Lubyanka and Lefortovo prisons,</i>

01:19:06.996 --> 01:19:10.542
<i>we discovered in torture
that vacuum glass explosion</i>

01:19:10.625 --> 01:19:14.671
inside mouth causes damage to...

01:19:15.046 --> 01:19:17.841
Soft tissue, to enamel, to bone,

01:19:18.216 --> 01:19:21.428
and to lungs, also.

01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:25.140
It's quite a bit of, what do you say,

01:19:27.392 --> 01:19:30.145
havoc for forty watts.

01:19:30.478 --> 01:19:31.855
Hard left coming up.

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:33.356
Just two blocks and you got him.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.066
- Push it!
- I am!

01:19:36.943 --> 01:19:39.946
But when you look at this,
Cathy, you will know

01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:43.241
and, Jack, you will understand,
that I am very serious

01:19:43.324 --> 01:19:45.702
when I say that
I want what you stole from me

01:19:45.785 --> 01:19:47.454
and I want it now.

01:19:50.999 --> 01:19:53.710
Do you think Jack will get to you?

01:19:56.713 --> 01:20:00.550
Or do you think
he thinks it is a game?

01:20:08.558 --> 01:20:10.185
<i>You think this is game, Jack?</i>

01:20:10.226 --> 01:20:11.269
<i>You think</i>

01:20:11.519 --> 01:20:15.899
my country bled for so many years
before your feet for game?

01:20:23.073 --> 01:20:24.157
Cathy!

01:20:28.286 --> 01:20:30.914
You think my son died for game?

01:20:30.997 --> 01:20:33.249
You think I will
let myself die for nothing?

01:20:33.291 --> 01:20:34.834
No, it is America

01:20:34.918 --> 01:20:37.754
that will soon
know what it is to have nothing.

01:20:38.171 --> 01:20:39.422
<i>He's got to cut back, Jack.</i>

01:20:39.506 --> 01:20:41.925
<i>You can catch him at the corner.
Run straight ahead.</i>

01:20:43.635 --> 01:20:46.388
I put bulb in her mouth, Jack!

01:20:46.429 --> 01:20:50.433
Now, I have my hand
beneath your bitch chin!

01:20:50.809 --> 01:20:53.770
<i>And now in moment, I will crush her jaw</i>

01:20:53.853 --> 01:20:57.190
so she bites down on it
and begins slow and painful death!

01:20:57.315 --> 01:20:58.900
<i>So, I will say it once more,</i>

01:20:58.942 --> 01:21:01.695
I want what you
stole from me and I want it now!

01:21:12.414 --> 01:21:13.748
Cathy!

01:21:13.915 --> 01:21:14.916
Cathy!

01:21:18.795 --> 01:21:20.296
Come on! Let's go!

01:21:20.338 --> 01:21:21.965
- Let's go. You're all right.
- We need to go, now!

01:21:22.048 --> 01:21:23.133
Keep moving! We need to go!

01:21:23.174 --> 01:21:25.218
The attack is going to happen, Ryan!

01:21:25.301 --> 01:21:26.970
You can't stop it.

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.281
Jack, we need to get out of here.

01:21:29.305 --> 01:21:30.515
The police are coming!

01:21:30.598 --> 01:21:32.017
I got her! She's in! She's in! She's in!

01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:33.977
Turn it on! Let's move! Let's move!

01:21:58.501 --> 01:22:00.128
Okay. Here's what we have.

01:22:00.170 --> 01:22:03.840
Aleksandr Borovsky,
AKA Andrew Bornstein, age 23.

01:22:03.923 --> 01:22:05.842
Last known address,
in Dearborn, Michigan.

01:22:06.259 --> 01:22:08.094
Move, move, move!

01:22:08.386 --> 01:22:09.512
- Let's go!
- Going in.

01:22:09.554 --> 01:22:10.597
Cover my six!

01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:14.351
The location's burned.
They're up and out recently.

01:22:14.434 --> 01:22:15.477
<i>They leave anything?</i>

01:22:15.518 --> 01:22:17.145
Ashes and melted plastic.

01:22:17.228 --> 01:22:19.481
FBI was tipped that
he might be a sleeper agent.

01:22:22.984 --> 01:22:24.778
A sleeper agent who was handpicked.

01:22:24.861 --> 01:22:26.196
This guy was groomed for it.

01:22:26.279 --> 01:22:27.572
This is personal.

01:22:29.074 --> 01:22:30.950
Wait a minute. Cherevin's son.

01:22:31.034 --> 01:22:32.035
What?

01:22:32.118 --> 01:22:35.038
Last night, Cherevin mentioned
something about his son

01:22:35.121 --> 01:22:36.873
having died. What if he didn't?

01:22:36.956 --> 01:22:39.125
Cross-referencing Moscow
hospital records,

01:22:39.209 --> 01:22:40.877
coroner's reports. Got it!

01:22:40.919 --> 01:22:42.837
Aleksandr Cherevin, age nine.

01:22:42.879 --> 01:22:44.714
Apparently died in a drowning accident,

01:22:44.798 --> 01:22:47.884
June 2004. Cherevin's own
signature is on the certificate.

01:22:47.967 --> 01:22:51.179
Aleksandr Borovsky entered
the country in '04 with his parents.

01:22:51.304 --> 01:22:52.806
Aleksandr Cherevin, age nine,

01:22:52.889 --> 01:22:54.724
and Aleksandr Borovsky, age nine.

01:22:54.808 --> 01:22:56.059
They're the same kid.

01:22:56.101 --> 01:22:58.687
He took a cash advance of $6,000.

01:22:58.770 --> 01:23:00.355
- And then he went black?
- Right.

01:23:00.438 --> 01:23:02.190
By now, he could be anywhere.

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:12.742
Hey, Al. Where you been?

01:23:12.826 --> 01:23:14.035
You in some kind of shit?

01:23:14.077 --> 01:23:16.318
FBI was crawling
all over here yesterday looking for you.

01:23:21.418 --> 01:23:24.004
Wait. The guy knew that
the FBI made his phone.

01:23:24.129 --> 01:23:25.964
He would dump it, right? He'd dump it.

01:23:26.464 --> 01:23:29.175
Michigan Bell.
Is there a listing near his house?

01:23:29.259 --> 01:23:30.427
Bear with me.

01:23:31.553 --> 01:23:32.554
Off-site delivery?

01:23:32.595 --> 01:23:34.180
<i>There's a way into him, I know it.</i>

01:23:34.264 --> 01:23:36.266
<i>- We just got to find it.</i>
- All right, drive safe.

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:42.939
That fake death certificate,
pull it up again.

01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:45.483
Cherevin couldn't do this alone.

01:23:45.984 --> 01:23:47.527
That second signature right there.

01:23:47.610 --> 01:23:49.404
The attending physician,
Mikhail Yureyovich,

01:23:49.446 --> 01:23:51.031
emigrated to the U.S. in '08.

01:23:51.114 --> 01:23:53.116
Attained U.S. citizenship
two years later.

01:23:53.199 --> 01:23:55.243
Give me his Social Security number.

01:23:56.536 --> 01:23:58.830
377-31-8622.

01:23:58.913 --> 01:24:00.790
Perfect. You have that?

01:24:00.832 --> 01:24:03.126
The doctor served
with Cherevin in Afghanistan.

01:24:03.168 --> 01:24:06.254
It looks like he's been subsidized
for years by Cherevin's firm.

01:24:06.296 --> 01:24:08.631
He's got at least four offshore accounts.

01:24:08.715 --> 01:24:09.966
Found the pay phone!

01:24:10.008 --> 01:24:11.676
- Six blocks away.
- Let me see.

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:13.386
They ran it, but it didn't
cross with anything.

01:24:13.470 --> 01:24:15.597
All right. All right. Here, here.

01:24:15.638 --> 01:24:17.974
Someone called a pay phone
in Pennsylvania

01:24:18.058 --> 01:24:20.602
from the pay phone
nearest to his house.

01:24:20.643 --> 01:24:21.883
Pennsylvania... Pennsylvania...

01:24:21.936 --> 01:24:23.146
Pennsylvania... Seventeen calls.

01:24:23.188 --> 01:24:24.731
That's it! That's it. That's it.

01:24:24.898 --> 01:24:28.818
We're searching for recent
nonresidential real estate transactions

01:24:28.902 --> 01:24:30.487
made by Yureyovich.

01:24:30.737 --> 01:24:32.364
Like a warehouse or storage facility.

01:24:32.447 --> 01:24:36.159
Got it. Barn at 211 Swallowsdale Road
and same zip code as the pay phone.

01:24:36.201 --> 01:24:39.537
<i>Sold six months ago
to Dr. Mikhail Yureyovich. All cash.</i>

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:43.583
He's in Pennsylvania.

01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:47.462
Nobody blows up Pennsylvania, Jack.

01:24:47.545 --> 01:24:49.422
Tom, he's in Pennsylvania.

01:24:59.683 --> 01:25:01.393
You're going to Pennsylvania.

01:25:01.518 --> 01:25:03.436
That's right. Get FBI to that barn.

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:05.563
I need people there now. Thank you.

01:25:17.394 --> 01:25:19.595
We still don't know
where the attack's gonna come, Jack.

01:25:19.619 --> 01:25:22.664
If Borovsky's on the move, we need
to know where the hell he's going.

01:25:22.706 --> 01:25:25.542
Cell phone triangulation.
Where does this guy travel to?

01:25:25.625 --> 01:25:27.669
- Where has he gone?
- Michigan, Michigan.

01:25:27.711 --> 01:25:29.129
Michigan. He hasn't been anywhere.

01:25:29.212 --> 01:25:31.881
Bullshit! We're not digging hard enough!

01:25:31.965 --> 01:25:33.967
Everybody goes somewhere.

01:25:36.261 --> 01:25:37.554
It's his parents.

01:25:37.637 --> 01:25:39.222
They're a unit, right? They're a unit.

01:25:39.305 --> 01:25:42.392
If he didn't travel somewhere,
maybe they did. Where did they go?

01:25:42.434 --> 01:25:44.227
Did they post pictures online?

01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:46.563
No, no, no. They wouldn't do that.
They're too smart for that.

01:25:46.646 --> 01:25:48.231
We're looking for extended family.

01:25:48.273 --> 01:25:49.983
Look for extended family.

01:25:50.150 --> 01:25:54.237
Oh, did they hit anybody's Instagram,
Facebook, Hopscotch? Reddit?

01:25:54.279 --> 01:25:55.488
Nope, none.

01:25:55.572 --> 01:25:56.823
Here. Image Looker.

01:25:56.906 --> 01:25:59.159
An uncle in New York. Borovsky's father

01:25:59.242 --> 01:26:03.121
accessed the account
from his phone four times, right here.

01:26:03.204 --> 01:26:05.290
Put it up on the main screen. Get it up.

01:26:07.292 --> 01:26:09.085
They're going to hit Manhattan.

01:26:09.419 --> 01:26:10.837
Jesus.

01:26:11.588 --> 01:26:13.590
Our guy never went to New York.

01:26:13.965 --> 01:26:15.759
He had someone scout it for him.

01:26:16.134 --> 01:26:17.927
And they posted the pictures

01:26:18.136 --> 01:26:19.929
so he could plan the attack.

01:26:28.563 --> 01:26:30.190
Wait, wait, stop.

01:26:30.732 --> 01:26:31.983
Back up.

01:26:33.985 --> 01:26:35.403
There, that.

01:26:40.450 --> 01:26:42.118
You know that building?

01:26:42.619 --> 01:26:45.288
- Jack works there. It's Wall Street.
- Oh, Jesus.

01:26:45.997 --> 01:26:48.083
An attack on downtown Manhattan.

01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:51.628
I'd say that'd start a panic.

01:26:58.885 --> 01:27:00.470
Get me Harper.

01:27:00.595 --> 01:27:01.805
Feds just uncovered evidence

01:27:01.846 --> 01:27:04.641
suggesting he camouflaged
a van stolen from work.

01:27:04.683 --> 01:27:07.394
Discarded tags,
auto paint, paint thinner.

01:27:18.947 --> 01:27:20.657
Tire tracks indicate we're looking for

01:27:20.699 --> 01:27:23.702
a Ford Econoline,
white or blue body, long wheel base.

01:27:23.785 --> 01:27:26.538
Tell FBI we can
be at the site in ten minutes.

01:27:26.621 --> 01:27:28.415
Dr. Muller, there's a car
to take you home.

01:27:28.498 --> 01:27:29.499
An agent will stay with you.

01:27:29.541 --> 01:27:31.835
No. Take me to Lennox Hill Hospital.
They might need me.

01:27:31.918 --> 01:27:33.003
If I don't make it back...

01:27:33.086 --> 01:27:35.213
Look. I will see you tonight.
We're having dinner.

01:27:35.296 --> 01:27:37.632
And we're gonna split the check.

01:27:37.674 --> 01:27:40.844
Sir? Excuse me. The chopper is ready.

01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:48.560
Have you been in one since?

01:27:48.685 --> 01:27:50.520
Don't worry about me.

01:27:51.187 --> 01:27:52.689
I haven't yet.

01:28:22.427 --> 01:28:23.887
Move! Bomb disposal going in!

01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:26.181
- Hold on!
- Get back, get back!

01:28:34.064 --> 01:28:36.733
<i>Please proceed as directed by officers.</i>

01:28:37.150 --> 01:28:39.069
<i>I repeat, a total evacuation...</i>

01:28:40.487 --> 01:28:41.571
Jesus Christ.

01:28:43.239 --> 01:28:45.325
<i>Emergency vehicles only</i>

01:28:45.408 --> 01:28:47.202
<i>are allowed access
beyond this perimeter.</i>

01:28:50.747 --> 01:28:52.165
<i>Emergency vehicles only...</i>

01:28:52.248 --> 01:28:54.501
We got a dozen
ESU trucks coming in right now.

01:28:54.584 --> 01:28:56.586
I put the alert out
to the FBI and Counterterrorism

01:28:56.628 --> 01:28:59.506
to expand the EBU's search
to a 30-block radius.

01:28:59.589 --> 01:29:01.049
No, this isn't right.

01:29:01.091 --> 01:29:03.259
<i>I repeat, emergency vehicles only</i>

01:29:03.343 --> 01:29:06.304
<i>are allowed access
beyond this perimeter.</i>

01:29:22.404 --> 01:29:24.614
I want air traffic shut down over the city.

01:29:27.117 --> 01:29:29.077
<i>Emergency vehicles only</i>

01:29:29.119 --> 01:29:31.121
<i>are allowed access
beyond this perimeter.</i>

01:29:42.716 --> 01:29:43.758
Harper!

01:29:43.967 --> 01:29:45.218
Harper!

01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:48.471
Harper!

01:29:51.599 --> 01:29:52.726
Teddy!

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:55.121
- Teddy.
- Jack! I thought you were in Moscow.

01:29:55.145 --> 01:29:56.563
I was. I need the bike.

01:29:56.646 --> 01:29:57.731
Jack!

01:30:14.122 --> 01:30:15.248
Jack.

01:30:15.457 --> 01:30:17.000
- I got him!
- Jack, where are you?

01:30:17.042 --> 01:30:18.084
<i>It's a diversion!</i>

01:30:18.168 --> 01:30:19.294
<i>The painting in Cherevin's office,</i>

01:30:19.336 --> 01:30:21.838
<i>it's right out of Napoleon's playbook.
It's Waterloo!</i>

01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:23.673
He's not going to the building,

01:30:23.715 --> 01:30:24.799
he's going under it!

01:30:26.092 --> 01:30:27.135
Jack?

01:30:39.606 --> 01:30:40.607
Jack!

01:30:41.649 --> 01:30:44.529
I need a cross-section of what's
underneath this building. I need it now.

01:30:59.042 --> 01:31:01.836
The greatest upward blast amplification,
where would it be?

01:31:01.878 --> 01:31:03.421
The convection chimney. Here.

01:31:03.505 --> 01:31:05.298
If the force
of the blast is channeled up through it,

01:31:05.382 --> 01:31:06.716
you're looking at shock over pressure,

01:31:06.758 --> 01:31:07.842
six or seven buildings come down.

01:31:07.884 --> 01:31:09.511
Jesus. That's half of Wall Street.

01:31:56.224 --> 01:31:57.600
Let's get this thing up!

01:31:58.643 --> 01:32:00.353
Come on, clear the area!
We got to move!

01:32:00.478 --> 01:32:01.813
Open it.

01:32:02.105 --> 01:32:03.505
Secure the ropes. We're going down!

01:32:33.136 --> 01:32:34.637
Oh, God, no.

01:33:25.605 --> 01:33:27.941
Where are you, Jack?
I've got people coming to you!

01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:37.033
We got nothing here, Harper!

01:33:45.542 --> 01:33:46.543
<i>Jack.</i>

01:33:46.626 --> 01:33:49.379
The sell-off's programmed for
9:06, that's two minutes from now.

01:33:49.421 --> 01:33:51.673
Harper, we're not talking about 10
or 15,000 people.

01:33:51.715 --> 01:33:52.882
More like 100,000.

01:33:53.174 --> 01:33:55.010
Just get me a clear path to the water!

01:33:55.301 --> 01:33:56.970
<i>Head north on Front Street.</i>

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:26.971
You didn't pick this life. I did.

01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:34.104
But I picked you.

01:37:37.691 --> 01:37:38.942
I can't even kiss you.

01:37:39.484 --> 01:37:40.777
- Yeah, you can.
- That side?

01:37:40.819 --> 01:37:43.571
- It doesn't hurt that much.
- Really? You sure?

01:37:58.837 --> 01:38:02.132
Commander Harper? Dr. Ryan?
They're ready for you.

01:38:04.050 --> 01:38:06.052
Direct. Clear.

01:38:06.803 --> 01:38:10.473
Concise. If he doesn't ask,
he doesn't want to know.

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:11.766
Yeah.

01:38:12.726 --> 01:38:13.977
Okay.

01:38:15.770 --> 01:38:19.357
Any way you can get that boy-scout-on-
a-field-trip look off your face?

01:38:19.774 --> 01:38:21.317
Not a chance.

01:38:23.987 --> 01:38:26.197
That's what I like about you.

01:38:32.746 --> 01:38:34.748
Harper, when do you ever sleep?

01:38:34.831 --> 01:38:36.332
You know what, don't answer that.

01:38:36.624 --> 01:38:39.669
I kind of like the idea that you don't.
Let me keep thinking it.

01:38:42.464 --> 01:38:44.049
And what's your name, son?

01:38:45.305 --> 01:38:51.618
