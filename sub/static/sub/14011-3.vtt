<i> by two separate</i>
<i> yet equally important groups--</i>

00:06.240 --> 00:08.140
<i> the police</i>
<i> who investigate crime</i>

00:08.142 --> 00:10.609
<i> and the district attorneys</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:10.611 --> 00:13.312
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:13.314 --> 00:16.448
Upstairs neighbor
complained about the smell.

00:16.450 --> 00:19.451
Don't worry, Max. There's
just three more flights.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.587
(<i> sirens wailing</i> )

00:21.589 --> 00:24.089
Didn't somebody
fry the coffee yet?

00:24.091 --> 00:25.357
Whoa!

00:25.359 --> 00:29.261
(<i> indistinct voices</i> )

00:35.136 --> 00:37.069
Yo, Profaci.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.508
Hey, Mikey.

00:42.510 --> 00:46.078
(<i> indistinct voices</i> )

00:48.182 --> 00:50.382
Holland, Bobby, 26, 27.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.583
Shot in back
of the head.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.218
Probably two days.

00:53.220 --> 00:56.321
Ask me,
he was probably a dealer.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.258
Weapon?

00:59.260 --> 01:00.526
Still looking.

01:00.528 --> 01:03.562
Who shoots in the head
besides dealers?

01:03.564 --> 01:06.432
A robber who gets surprised?

01:06.434 --> 01:12.404
A burglar so surprised,
he leaves behind a full wallet?

01:15.609 --> 01:20.079
   Captioning sponsored by
   NBC/UNIVERSAL

02:36.624 --> 02:38.323
Needs a paint job.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.225
The guy's dead.

02:40.227 --> 02:42.561
If they had
downstairs...

02:42.563 --> 02:44.563
I'm below him, in 2a.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.565
You ever talk to him?

02:46.567 --> 02:48.400
He listened
to sad music.

02:48.402 --> 02:51.470
Piano stuff, Gershwin.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.571
Left early.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.306
Came home late.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.308
See anybody with him
Saturday night?

02:56.310 --> 02:57.809
Saturday night
about 1:30

02:57.811 --> 02:59.444
I'm coming back

02:59.446 --> 03:01.513
from Symphony Space.
This guy tears past me.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.815
Did you get
a good look at him?

03:03.817 --> 03:07.419
1:00 a.m., guy goes running
down the steps in this city?

03:07.421 --> 03:08.654
I've learned not to look.

03:10.491 --> 03:11.823
Brownstones?

03:11.825 --> 03:13.825
They're invitations
to get robbed.

03:13.827 --> 03:16.295
How many sets of prints
have you got?

03:16.297 --> 03:18.297
We got partials from about
a dozen people.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.299
It's what you'd expect,

03:20.301 --> 03:22.467
unless somebody
wiped the place down.

03:22.469 --> 03:23.702
You run them?

03:23.704 --> 03:25.237
No match.

03:25.239 --> 03:27.606
None of his friends
had records.

03:27.608 --> 03:28.807
Neither did he.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.742
What'd they used to say?

03:30.744 --> 03:34.413
Live fast, die young,
leave a beautiful corpse.

03:34.415 --> 03:37.616
Whoever shot this one didn't
care much about beautiful.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.618
You should have seen
the apartment.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.587
More trashed
than the victim.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.789
Not to boil your coffee
or anything

03:43.791 --> 03:46.391
but a guy fights
with a burglar...

03:46.393 --> 03:47.826
He gets
banged up.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.795
Not the late Mr. Holland.

03:49.797 --> 03:53.599
Not a bruise, not a mark,
not a scratch on the body.

03:53.601 --> 03:56.268
Just a nice, clean
.38 entrance wound.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.269
Close range?

03:57.271 --> 03:59.271
A foot, maybe 18 inches.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.505
Powder burns...

04:00.507 --> 04:02.774
Stippling.
You check both hands?

04:02.776 --> 04:04.643
Clean, not a
trace of powder.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.511
The guy didn't shoot himself,
that's dead certain.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.654
WOMAN:
Bobby was big. He...

04:15.656 --> 04:18.924
When he was born,
he was over 11 pounds.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.760
He's always been big.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.663
They don't attack big people.

04:24.665 --> 04:27.399
I read it in the<i> Post.</i>

04:29.803 --> 04:33.405
Could you tell us
about your son's friends--

04:33.407 --> 04:35.474
places he used to hang out?

04:38.679 --> 04:41.647
He kept to himself a lot.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.715
He didn't have a lot of friends.

04:45.886 --> 04:49.554
I should go get his mail.

04:49.556 --> 04:53.625
Bobby have any brothers,
sisters?

04:56.430 --> 04:59.731
After Bobby,
we didn't have any more.

05:02.770 --> 05:06.672
He was a very difficult birth,
and I had...

05:06.674 --> 05:08.740
well, there were just...

05:08.742 --> 05:11.510
there were no more children.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.848
And now we've lost him.

05:16.850 --> 05:20.385
We lost him when he moved
over the bridge.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.628
(<i> moans</i> )

05:29.630 --> 05:31.463
GREEVEY:
Personal possessions.

05:31.465 --> 05:35.667
Things they found on him
when he was brought in.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.470
Would you sign
for them, please?

05:38.472 --> 05:39.871
Took the watch, huh?

05:39.873 --> 05:41.673
An Omega.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.675
Big, heavy job, steel.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.677
High school graduation.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.880
It cost me a week's pay.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.449
The band?

05:50.451 --> 05:54.453
It had links, tight,
steel, too.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.888
He wore it to work
without worry.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.691
When he first moved
to the city

05:59.693 --> 06:01.693
I bought him a gun.

06:01.695 --> 06:02.894
A pistol?

06:02.896 --> 06:04.896
.38. It was licensed.

06:04.898 --> 06:08.500
I told him to keep it
next to the bed.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.569
Why didn't he
defend himself?

06:10.571 --> 06:12.804
You got a big, tough guy,
big enough to toss

06:12.806 --> 06:14.473
most people around
like a pillow.

06:14.475 --> 06:15.907
There's always somebody bigger.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.542
Captain, the apartment
looked like Beirut.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.678
And our vic,
not a bruise
or a cut lip.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.480
Now, you fight
with a crackhead

06:21.482 --> 06:23.648
you're going to get hit,
something.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.550
A bullet in the head.
Isn't that something?

06:25.552 --> 06:27.786
How did the perp
get in?

06:27.788 --> 06:28.920
Fire escape?

06:28.922 --> 06:30.555
Nope. One door,
no fire escape.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.791
Well, then, maybe we're talking
about a friend here.

06:32.793 --> 06:33.859
A friend with
a grudge?

06:33.861 --> 06:35.660
You got something better?

06:35.662 --> 06:37.996
Maybe you should go out,
shake up the ground

06:37.998 --> 06:39.765
a little bit,
see who he knew.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.672
MAN:
Lock it down, tie it off!

06:47.674 --> 06:50.942
Whoa, whoa, whoa, right there,
right there. Hold up.

06:50.944 --> 06:54.513
I hope to God
you get who did it.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.815
Bobby was a good man.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.784
Women problems?

06:58.786 --> 07:01.486
Bobby didn't cat around.

07:01.488 --> 07:03.455
Gambling?

07:03.457 --> 07:05.791
Not even
a football pool.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.926
Did Bobby Holland hang out
after work?

07:07.928 --> 07:10.595
Didn't even come
to union meetings.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.998
Mr. Massacio, come on, he must
have hung out with somebody.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.900
Go ask Suarez. Angel.

07:14.902 --> 07:17.502
Sometimes they
had lunch together.

07:17.504 --> 07:18.837
Thanks.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.510
Angel Suarez?

07:25.512 --> 07:28.013
Detective Logan,
Sergeant Greevey.

07:31.051 --> 07:34.085
I already heard about Bobby.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.821
You a friend of his?

07:35.823 --> 07:37.923
I knew him.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.891
Real broken up, huh?

07:39.893 --> 07:41.860
If I knew who did him,
I'd let you know.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.528
Where were you
Saturday night?

07:44.932 --> 07:47.632
In San Juan,
visiting my parents.

07:47.634 --> 07:50.068
I got back Sunday night.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.638
You want to see my plane ticket?

07:53.640 --> 07:57.008
We're talking murder here.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.678
Look, the night Bobby got it

07:59.680 --> 08:03.682
he was having a drink
with a friend, Lois Rivera.

08:03.684 --> 08:07.886
She has a gourmet sandwich cart
up on Upper Westside.

08:07.888 --> 08:11.623
If you guys find the killer
and want to save the state

08:11.625 --> 08:14.092
the price of the trial,
give me a call.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.599
Thanks.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.001
That night
before I met my sister,

08:23.003 --> 08:25.570
I had a drink
with Bobby.

08:25.572 --> 08:28.006
We talked a while,
about nothing really.

08:28.008 --> 08:31.576
I just told him I thought he
should go back to school.

08:31.578 --> 08:33.912
City College,
part-time.

08:33.914 --> 08:36.581
Bobby was real smart.

08:36.583 --> 08:39.951
He knew a lot about music,
he read a lot of books.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.120
Would anybody
want to hurt him?

08:44.024 --> 08:45.190
No.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.559
Nobody I can think of.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.895
Where did he go
after he left you?

08:52.833 --> 08:54.933
It's Lois, right?

08:54.935 --> 08:56.601
Listen.

08:56.603 --> 09:01.873
Somebody blew your boyfriend's
brains out with a .38, okay?

09:03.677 --> 09:06.011
He went to a bar downtown.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.212
Paradise Lost.

09:10.083 --> 09:15.620
Look,
I really wasn't Bobby's girl--

09:15.622 --> 09:17.789
just a good friend.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.697
Bobby was gay.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.638
You couldn't miss the guy.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.940
Why not?

09:34.942 --> 09:37.609
The kind of crowd we get.
You know, average guys.

09:37.611 --> 09:40.845
Construction workers,
grad students from
N.Y.U., easy mix.

09:40.847 --> 09:42.080
Neighborhood.
So here's this character

09:42.082 --> 09:43.848
dressed kind of<i> charivari.</i>

09:43.850 --> 09:45.884
Black t-shirt,
gray silk jacket.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.218
You know the look--

09:47.220 --> 09:48.853
"I'm cool and you're not."

09:48.855 --> 09:50.855
You ever seen him
with Holland before?

09:50.857 --> 09:53.892
Bobby doesn't come in
a lot lately.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.995
More like,
after work for a Michelob.

09:56.997 --> 10:01.132
The silk jacket and Bobby
were sitting over there.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.901
Couldn't hear them.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.703
Then they were gone.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.805
Silk jacket...

10:06.807 --> 10:08.206
want to know the truth?

10:08.208 --> 10:10.675
I thought he was a hustler.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.777
Something about him.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.813
I don't know.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.850
I don't know.

10:19.886 --> 10:22.687
LOGAN:
<i> So he was rough-trade.</i>

10:22.689 --> 10:24.689
So they do their thing.

10:24.691 --> 10:26.825
Mr. Silk jacket
does it all.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.361
Sex, kills the guy

10:29.362 --> 10:31.896
then trashes the place
looking for something to take.

10:31.898 --> 10:34.232
Yeah. Any odds
on finding him?

10:34.234 --> 10:38.236
About as good as finding
true love at Paradise Lost.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.205
I don't know.
His parents, his boss,

10:40.207 --> 10:42.807
his co-workers,
his neighbors...

10:42.809 --> 10:45.010
no one knew this guy was gay.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.112
If they're out there,
I don't see them either.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.314
Think a lot of cops are gay?

10:49.316 --> 10:51.082
No way, man.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.051
The department's
got a special test.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.320
They look you in the eye.
If your left eye blinks

10:55.322 --> 10:57.255
before your right eye,
they know you're gay.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.163
They say
one in ten, max.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.931
That's a lot.

11:06.933 --> 11:09.067
They just fade in.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.835
Silk jacket?

11:10.837 --> 11:13.738
Five to one
he's not in any of these.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.240
Good news and bad news.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.142
Let me guess.
The good news is,

11:17.144 --> 11:19.044
somebody just walked in
and confessed?

11:19.046 --> 11:21.246
The good news
is they found the gun.

11:21.248 --> 11:23.214
Empty lot, six blocks away.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.016
Bad news? Wiped clean.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.184
GREEVEY:
Registration?

11:26.186 --> 11:28.019
You're going to love this.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.888
Your vic, Bobby Holland.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.023
Terrific.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.733
Bobby was always popular
with the girls.

11:41.735 --> 11:44.736
He was a halfback
on the football team.

11:44.738 --> 11:48.740
He was on the student council.
He was king of the prom.

11:48.742 --> 11:51.409
He hid his magazines
under the mattress.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.712
<i> Playboy.</i>

11:53.714 --> 11:57.315
My son was not homosexual.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.458
She knows.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.293
She just can't admit it.

12:08.295 --> 12:11.129
And you?
Bobby had everything
going for him.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.198
Any girl he wanted.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.734
His friends would
come over, hang out
in the yard,

12:15.736 --> 12:17.302
just to be around him.

12:17.304 --> 12:20.338
Have him throw the football...
like that.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.908
When he dropped
his high-school girlfriend...

12:25.312 --> 12:27.345
a beauty.

12:27.347 --> 12:28.346
She was a beauty.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.748
Gorgeous.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.350
He moved
to Manhattan.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.452
Hmm.

12:34.454 --> 12:37.455
I'd go to visit him in the city.

12:37.457 --> 12:42.460
Sometimes I'd just stare.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.863
He looked like everybody else.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.132
He talked like everybody else.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.933
Do you know if he

12:48.935 --> 12:50.301
brought people home a lot?

12:50.303 --> 12:52.537
I told him

12:52.538 --> 12:54.772
"You don't know what kind
of nuts you're meeting.

12:54.775 --> 12:57.776
There's all kinds
of loonies out there."

12:57.778 --> 13:00.311
That's when
I bought him the gun.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.946
What about
boyfriends?

13:01.948 --> 13:03.815
He ever tell you anything
about any of them?

13:03.817 --> 13:05.416
What do you want to hear?

13:05.418 --> 13:07.418
Want to rub my nose in it?

13:12.225 --> 13:14.559
He mentioned one guy.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.163
Angel.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.401
Angel somebody.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.239
Danny Massacio in there?

13:28.241 --> 13:30.241
What do you think he'd say?

13:30.243 --> 13:32.243
You told him Bobby was gay.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.378
Or that you are.

13:33.380 --> 13:34.913
He'd never believe it.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.181
He'd laugh.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.582
And that's how I want it.

13:37.584 --> 13:41.452
What about you
and Bobby Holland?

13:41.454 --> 13:43.388
I used to hate being gay.

13:43.390 --> 13:46.157
I used to make
fag jokes all the time.

13:46.159 --> 13:49.394
You know, the way blacks
call each other "nigger."

13:49.396 --> 13:52.897
Anyway, Bobby would never
let me get away with it.

13:52.899 --> 13:55.366
I was in love with Bobby.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.903
So you take a weekend
out of town

13:58.905 --> 14:01.406
and he picks up
somebody else, huh?

14:01.408 --> 14:04.876
Six, eight weeks ago,
he started seeing somebody new.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.411
Um... we were over.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.847
Anyway, I don't know
what this guy had for him

14:08.849 --> 14:10.248
but they met at the gym.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.883
You know his name?

14:11.885 --> 14:14.352
He lives somewhere
on the Eastside.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.287
Jack.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.256
I don't know his last name.

14:21.428 --> 14:23.895
Gray silk jacket
named Jack?

14:23.897 --> 14:25.029
Great.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.497
Bullet to the head.

14:26.499 --> 14:29.300
This case,
I heard about it before.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.402
What are you,
a psychic now?

14:31.404 --> 14:34.305
Month ago, maybe two,
same kind of killing.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.857
Gay bashing?

14:35.858 --> 14:37.408
I read about it
in<i> Time, Newsweek.</i>

14:37.410 --> 14:39.377
Last week or week before.

14:41.615 --> 14:45.383
You sure you didn't read
about this in your dreams?

14:45.385 --> 14:47.485

14:53.426 --> 14:55.927
One of them interests you.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.595
Earthquakes...

14:59.466 --> 15:01.666
And murder.

15:05.972 --> 15:08.539
GREEVEY:
No prints here either.

15:10.977 --> 15:13.978
Gun was found
in an empty lot wiped clean.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.947
Burglary?

15:17.984 --> 15:19.684
Uh-huh.

15:19.686 --> 15:22.353
Ripped the place apart.

15:22.355 --> 15:25.556
A week later, another one just
like it in L.A.

15:26.960 --> 15:30.361
The vic's address book?

15:30.363 --> 15:32.497
Can you fax it?

15:32.499 --> 15:36.434
212-555-8342.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.005
Yeah. All right.

15:41.007 --> 15:42.440
Thanks.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.277

15:53.520 --> 15:56.587
They're not as friendly
in Los Angeles.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.290
Too much sun
makes them crazy.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.410
Am I sure
it's a similar case?

16:02.411 --> 16:05.529
Look, I'm as sure
as I can be not looking
at the bodies, okay?

16:05.532 --> 16:06.965
Right. Uh-huh.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.533
The victim had
no address book.

16:08.535 --> 16:12.036
Just a lot of phone numbers
on scraps of paper.

16:12.038 --> 16:13.404
Copies?

16:13.406 --> 16:15.707
Oh, an open
homicide investigation?

16:15.709 --> 16:20.144
What do you think we're doing,
getting cats out of trees?

16:20.146 --> 16:23.147
Huh? Look, we link the victims,
we got a case, okay?

16:23.149 --> 16:25.416
Now if you can just send us...

16:25.418 --> 16:28.152
Nobody's asking
for the originals, huh?

16:28.154 --> 16:30.688
Just fax us
whatever you got, okay?

16:30.690 --> 16:32.023
What?

16:32.025 --> 16:34.325
Hey, fax you, okay?

Put the fire out

Yes, yes, Captain.

Mm-hmm.

Yeah, if it's
their collar.

16:59.652 --> 17:02.203
Well, of course
we understand.

17:02.204 --> 17:04.755
Well, Detective Logan
has been under a little pressure

17:04.758 --> 17:06.357
on this case.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.759
Pressure?

17:07.761 --> 17:09.594
Yes.

17:09.596 --> 17:12.563
Yes, we would appreciate that
very much.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.399
A courier?

17:15.435 --> 17:17.502
Well, the city is bankrupt

17:17.504 --> 17:21.205
but yes, yes, I think we could
spring for a courier.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.373

Yeah.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.644

They don't want to lose
even a copy of this stuff.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.682
What's with them?

17:31.684 --> 17:34.102
You know, fellows,

17:34.103 --> 17:36.521

That's Holland's J. Curry.

18:37.584 --> 18:41.552
San Francisco's got John C.,

18:41.554 --> 18:46.858
who lives in New York
and has the same phone number.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.796
Yeah.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.832
And L.A.'s got...

18:59.239 --> 19:03.708
J.R.C., New York...

19:08.748 --> 19:10.648
Same number.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.519
You got the odds
on three murder victims

19:14.521 --> 19:18.689

19:18.691 --> 19:22.326
He was in San Francisco and L.A.
when the others were killed.

19:22.328 --> 19:23.261
Same days?

19:23.263 --> 19:25.763
And one on either side.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.166
And all three of them had his
name in their address book?

Not to mention, Bobby Holland's
new boyfriend's name is Jack.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.339

19:35.341 --> 19:36.874
Pick him up.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.514
Bust the door
and then stand back.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.183

19:56.629 --> 19:57.695

Which one of you
is Jack Curry?
I'm Jack Curry.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.936
You're under arrest
for the murder
of Bobby Holland.

20:04.938 --> 20:07.805
Put your hands on
top of your head! Now!
But I...

20:08.641 --> 20:10.575
Check it out.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.777
Get up. Get up.

20:12.779 --> 20:15.613

Get your hands down!

You have the right
to an attorney.

an attorney

20:24.324 --> 20:26.624

Geez, we tried to get him
a private suite.

20:50.984 --> 20:53.284
Eh, he looks like
he survived.

20:53.286 --> 20:54.885
Well, it isn't my
business, Counselor,

20:54.887 --> 20:57.321
but this case, it isn't
exactly your ball game.

20:57.323 --> 20:58.956
How wrong you are,
Mr. Robinette.

20:58.958 --> 21:03.027
We're building a whole
new ball park with this one.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.863
I'll allow my client
to answer questions,

21:05.865 --> 21:08.299
but I may cut this off
at any time.

21:08.301 --> 21:09.433
Let's start with
the wristwatch, Jack--

21:09.435 --> 21:11.969
engraved to Bobby Holland
on the back?

21:14.007 --> 21:16.807
Bobby gave it to me
as a present.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.743
Just before you
blew his head off.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.444
To thank me

21:20.446 --> 21:23.014
for helping him
to shoot himself.

21:23.016 --> 21:25.549
You want to run that
by us again?

21:25.551 --> 21:29.987
Bobby wanted help
to commit suicide.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.857
Look, he had AIDS.

21:32.859 --> 21:35.893
He wanted it to look
like a robbery

21:35.895 --> 21:38.529
so his mother
wouldn't know.

21:38.531 --> 21:42.533
And when you went to visit
Uncle Joe in Los Angeles?

21:42.535 --> 21:45.403
And Aunt Millie
in San Francisco?

21:52.345 --> 21:54.412
You know about them.

21:57.850 --> 22:00.051
Uh, look...

22:00.053 --> 22:04.355
if you commit suicide,
you don't get the insurance.

22:04.357 --> 22:05.589
Those men...

22:05.591 --> 22:06.590
Forrest?

22:06.592 --> 22:08.359
Dodge?

22:08.361 --> 22:11.495
Yes. They pulled
the triggers themselves.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.431
And you just wiped the gun
clean?

22:13.433 --> 22:17.101
My client has nothing
to say about those cases.

22:17.103 --> 22:19.970
What about Bobby Holland?

22:19.972 --> 22:22.473
Do you know
what AIDS looks like?

22:22.475 --> 22:25.076
Have you seen Kaposi's sarcoma?

22:25.078 --> 22:27.978
You know what pneumocystis does?

22:27.980 --> 22:30.815
What it's like
when you can't breathe?

22:30.817 --> 22:33.351
Dodge won a silver medal
in Seoul.

22:33.353 --> 22:36.587
Forrest used to be
a professor out at U.C.L.A.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.456
Ph.D. in linguistics.

22:38.458 --> 22:42.393
The last month of his life,
he forgot how to tell time.

22:42.395 --> 22:45.096
Did you shoot Bobby Holland?

22:45.098 --> 22:48.032
Bobby didn't want to waste away.

22:48.034 --> 22:51.035
Who pulled the trigger?

22:52.538 --> 22:55.439
I held the gun.

22:55.441 --> 22:58.609
Bobby wrapped his hand
around mine.

22:58.611 --> 23:01.112
He said he wanted to die.

23:01.114 --> 23:04.482
I helped Bobby
do what he wanted.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.653
I didn't...

23:09.655 --> 23:11.655
I didn't<i> want</i> to do it,

23:11.657 --> 23:14.091
but I wasn't considering myself.

23:14.093 --> 23:16.627
It's called mercy killing.

23:16.629 --> 23:20.965
You have 48 hours to arraign him
or let him go.

23:20.967 --> 23:22.933
Ask the medical examiner
if Holland did have AIDS.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.435
You'll get answers
faster than I will.

23:24.437 --> 23:25.903
And if Holland did?

23:25.905 --> 23:29.540
Find out about the victims
in L.A. and San Francisco.

23:29.542 --> 23:32.043
What if they
had AIDS, too?

23:32.044 --> 23:34.545
We'll need answers to questions
we haven't even thought of.

23:34.547 --> 23:35.880
The guy's jive,
I'm telling you.

23:35.882 --> 23:37.615
Yeah? Well, the jury
might not think so.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.717
Yeah, well, what's the jury
gonna think when they hear

23:39.719 --> 23:41.452
that Holland
never even touched the gun?

23:41.454 --> 23:43.654
No powder residue
on his hands.

23:44.590 --> 23:45.923
Holland had AIDS.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.125
So did San Francisco
and L.A.

23:48.127 --> 23:51.095
So Curry's telling the truth.
Or part of the truth.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.597
You say it's a mercy killing,
you don't do 15 to life.

23:53.599 --> 23:56.133
Because someone has AIDS doesn't
mean he can't be murdered.

23:56.135 --> 23:59.003
But where does that get us?
He's killing these AIDS
patients for kicks?

23:59.005 --> 24:02.206
I hated Bobby being that way.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.141
I hated the people
he hung out with.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.644
I hated the way
he lived his life,

24:06.646 --> 24:10.948
but this guy Curry--
you shouldn't put him in jail.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.516
He shot your son.

24:12.518 --> 24:15.920
You read the articles?
Newspapers?

24:15.922 --> 24:18.489
Not an easy way to go.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.928
Bobby wanted to die.

24:23.930 --> 24:26.063
You can't be sure of that.

24:28.034 --> 24:31.936
Yes, I can.

24:31.938 --> 24:36.073
Bobby asked me
to shoot him first.

24:38.945 --> 24:42.646
I knew Bobby was gay.

24:42.648 --> 24:47.618
We just couldn't talk
about it.

24:47.620 --> 24:51.021
I'll never
have that chance now.

24:51.023 --> 24:55.759
That bastard Curry
killed my son.

24:55.761 --> 24:58.662
You have to put that man
in jail.

24:58.664 --> 25:02.266
The defense is going to make
a very strong case

25:02.268 --> 25:05.135
that your son
intended to die.

25:08.074 --> 25:10.808
I've been getting Bobby's mail.

25:10.810 --> 25:12.276
This letter--

25:12.278 --> 25:15.079
"Gay Men Allied Against AIDS."

25:15.081 --> 25:18.082
Bobby had an appointment
with someone

25:18.084 --> 25:20.251
to talk about
taking A.Z.T.

25:23.256 --> 25:25.623
My son wanted to live.

25:27.693 --> 25:31.061
JUDGE:
The charges are murder
in the second degree

25:31.063 --> 25:35.599
conspiracy in the first degree,
manslaughter in the first degree

25:35.601 --> 25:39.303
criminally negligent homicide,
promoting a suicide attempt

25:39.305 --> 25:41.305
and reckless endangerment
in the second degree.

25:41.307 --> 25:44.074
Does the defendant
wish to enter a plea?

25:44.076 --> 25:46.210
Yes, Your Honor, not
guilty on all counts.

25:46.212 --> 25:49.580
Do the people have a bail
recommendation, Mr. Stone?

25:49.582 --> 25:51.933
This case is a
homicide, Your Honor.

25:51.934 --> 25:54.285
Despite the circumstances,
we feel that some
bail is necessary.

25:54.287 --> 25:56.554
Personally, I'm uncomfortable

25:56.555 --> 25:58.822
releasing any
homicide defendant
without substantial bail,

25:58.824 --> 26:03.827
but I do not feel this defendant
is a major flight risk.

26:03.829 --> 26:05.596
$50,000,
short date.

26:05.598 --> 26:07.097
(<i> gavel bangs</i> )

26:08.701 --> 26:11.602
Our government is killing us
through neglect.

26:11.604 --> 26:14.104
The mayor, the governor,
the president,

26:14.106 --> 26:15.773
they have blood on their hands.

26:15.775 --> 26:19.310
While we're dying,
they're prosecuting Jack Curry.

26:19.312 --> 26:22.112
Take the money
from the district attorney

26:22.114 --> 26:24.615
and give it
to the health department.

26:24.617 --> 26:28.052
Mr. Gordon, do you think
the prosecution is hostile
to people with AIDS?

26:28.054 --> 26:31.088
GORDON:
If Bobby Holland was dying of
Alzheimer's and Jack Curry

26:31.090 --> 26:32.823
wasn't gay, would they charge
him with murder?

26:32.825 --> 26:35.059
(<i> shuts off TV</i> )

26:35.060 --> 26:37.294
Every gay activist in
the country's gonna be after us.

26:37.296 --> 26:39.630
I understand, Adam, but
gay-straight is not the issue.

26:39.632 --> 26:42.199
Murder masquerading as assisted
suicide is the issue.

26:42.201 --> 26:44.168
Now, let's say we drop
all the charges

26:44.170 --> 26:46.070
and we just go
for a misdemeanor.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.671
We're not ignoring the
gay-straight question;

26:47.673 --> 26:49.206
we're making it
the<i> only</i> question.

26:49.208 --> 26:50.841
You know what that is?

26:50.843 --> 26:52.176
Good politics.

26:52.178 --> 26:53.677
Yes, and bad law.

26:53.679 --> 26:55.279
It is not compassion.

26:55.281 --> 26:58.649
It's pity for gay people,
and pity is one step away

26:58.651 --> 27:00.317
from ridicule.

27:00.319 --> 27:03.320
Now what if Bobby Holland
wanted to die?

27:03.322 --> 27:08.125
How does anybody know what went
through Bobby Holland's mind

27:08.127 --> 27:10.327
five minutes before he died?

27:10.329 --> 27:12.730
Or two minutes? Or 20 seconds?

27:12.732 --> 27:14.198
Or one second?

27:14.200 --> 27:17.635
And Jack Curry,
who's done this twice before,

27:17.637 --> 27:19.670
did he talk him into it?

27:19.672 --> 27:21.739
You can't change the fact

27:21.741 --> 27:24.675
that Holland was gay
and Curry is gay.

27:24.677 --> 27:26.243
What I can't change

27:26.245 --> 27:29.747
is that Jack Curry didn't
bring pills and leave them.

27:29.749 --> 27:32.216
He didn't bring a gun
and leave it.

27:32.218 --> 27:34.284
He pulled the trigger.

27:36.222 --> 27:38.222
MAN:
<i> Gay Men Allied Against AIDS.</i>

27:38.224 --> 27:41.225
Bobby Holland didn't need
an angel of death.

27:41.227 --> 27:43.127
He wasn't that sick yet.

27:43.129 --> 27:44.662
Did he want to die?

27:44.664 --> 27:47.131
Look, you're H.I.V.-positive.

27:47.133 --> 27:51.168
You think you'll hang around
till you get sick.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.803
You start to feel lousy,

27:52.805 --> 27:56.173
it's hardly unusual
to think about suicide.

27:58.744 --> 28:00.744
Bobby wanted to kill himself.

28:00.746 --> 28:02.212
I told him not to.

28:03.449 --> 28:04.782
And?

28:04.784 --> 28:07.251
He said he'd think about it--

28:07.253 --> 28:09.453
going on A.Z.T.,
trying experimental drugs.

28:09.455 --> 28:13.223
I saw Conrad
Gordon on TV.

28:13.225 --> 28:15.859
Anybody want
to call Jack Curry a hero

28:15.861 --> 28:17.828
I tell them to look at me.

28:17.830 --> 28:19.396
I was diagnosed

28:19.398 --> 28:23.000
with AIDS when it was still
called "GRID," for God's sake.

28:23.002 --> 28:24.435
I'm still here.

28:25.938 --> 28:32.409
Curry had no right
to shoot Bobby Holland.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.345
Okay, thanks.

28:41.020 --> 28:43.287
You're saying Bobby Holland
might have reconsidered?

28:43.289 --> 28:45.823
If he'd reconsidered,
my client wouldn't be here.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.424
You don't know that,
I don't know that.

28:47.426 --> 28:49.493
And even you don't
know that, Mr. Curry.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.428
You were involved
in those cases in California.

28:51.430 --> 28:54.965
Do you have a stake
in getting these people to die?

28:54.967 --> 28:57.401
No, Mr. Stone, I don't.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.770
Did you try
to talk Bobby Holland out of it?

28:59.772 --> 29:02.372
Several times
over several hours.

29:02.374 --> 29:05.375
He didn't want
to turn into a zombie.

29:05.377 --> 29:08.312
What if it were your son,
Mr. Stone?

29:08.314 --> 29:11.482
If it were my son, I'd take him
to every hospital in America

29:11.484 --> 29:13.383
to try to save him.

29:13.385 --> 29:16.353
We'll plead
to promoting a suicide.

29:16.355 --> 29:17.788
You'll plead

29:17.790 --> 29:19.356
to manslaughter one.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.391
We'll drop the other charges

29:21.393 --> 29:24.294
and we'll make
a sentencing recommendation.

29:24.296 --> 29:26.497
Bobby Holland intended
to shoot himself.

29:26.499 --> 29:30.801
Manslaughter one is an admission
my client intended to shoot him.

29:30.803 --> 29:33.871
He didn't shoot him
full of penicillin.

29:35.808 --> 29:37.875
We're finished here, Jack.

29:39.779 --> 29:41.278
Mr. Stone...

29:41.280 --> 29:44.915
I hope you never have to face
these choices yourself.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.484
I hope you never
see anybody dying

29:47.486 --> 29:49.820
the way I've seen
people die.

29:49.822 --> 29:53.090
But if you do,
I hope you have the courage

29:53.092 --> 29:56.426
to do whatever has to be done.

30:08.107 --> 30:11.575
DEBAKEY:
And what is your position
at the hospice, Mr. Wellman?

30:11.577 --> 30:13.510
WELLMAN:
I counsel people
with AIDS.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.412
Over the past year

30:15.414 --> 30:17.581
how many people
have you counseled?

30:17.583 --> 30:20.384
Short-term, over 100;
long-term, perhaps two dozen.

30:20.386 --> 30:23.453
And how long
have you worked there?

30:23.455 --> 30:25.055
Eleven years.

30:25.057 --> 30:27.391
Everyone you care for is dying?

30:27.393 --> 30:30.327
We're all dying, Ms. Debakey.

30:30.329 --> 30:35.399
I mean the people in the hospice
are terminally ill.

30:35.401 --> 30:38.468
Most of those who come to us
will die within a year.

30:38.470 --> 30:41.572
Isn't it true
that many cancer patients

30:41.574 --> 30:44.408
experience excruciating pain?

30:44.410 --> 30:46.343
Yes, that's common.

30:48.147 --> 30:51.448
You ever counseled anyone
to commit suicide?

30:51.450 --> 30:52.850
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

30:52.852 --> 30:55.319
This trial
isn't about the right to die.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.421
It's about whether the defendant
shot Bobby Holland.

30:57.423 --> 30:59.056
The issues surrounding
right-to-die are murky

30:59.058 --> 31:00.591
in this state, Mr. Stone.

31:00.593 --> 31:03.126
The testimony
seems to me relevant.

31:03.128 --> 31:04.862
The witness
will continue.

31:04.864 --> 31:08.932
I've counseled people
on suicide, yes.

31:08.934 --> 31:12.569
We call it "letting yourself
be snowed under."

31:12.571 --> 31:14.037
And what do you
counsel them?

31:14.039 --> 31:15.906
Well, we suggest
that they go to England

31:15.908 --> 31:19.176
where doctors have the right to
assist their patients in dying.

31:19.178 --> 31:20.978
Thank you.

31:22.414 --> 31:25.582
Mr. Wellman, have you ever given
to anyone in your hospice

31:25.584 --> 31:28.118
lethal chemicals, a gun,
any device

31:28.120 --> 31:30.654
that might help them
commit suicide?

31:30.656 --> 31:32.389
No.

31:32.391 --> 31:33.590
Why not?

31:33.592 --> 31:37.928
I've been told
it's against the law.

31:37.930 --> 31:40.497
GORDON:
We've established a hot line to
answer questions about AIDS.

31:40.499 --> 31:44.601
How many of those
calls have you answered
personally, Mr. Gordon?

31:44.603 --> 31:45.636
Thousands.

31:45.638 --> 31:48.105
I volunteer
three nights a week.

31:48.107 --> 31:49.940
I've been doing
it for seven years.

31:49.942 --> 31:51.608
Do the callers
ever ask you about suicide?

31:51.610 --> 31:54.077
Frequently.
And what do you tell them?

31:54.079 --> 31:57.581
That dying of AIDS
is a difficult death

31:57.583 --> 32:02.219
and that they have
the right to take their own life

32:02.221 --> 32:05.555
when the pain becomes too great.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.660
Your witness, Mr. Stone.

32:09.662 --> 32:12.195
Mr. Gordon, as a gay activist,
you're familiar

32:12.197 --> 32:14.197
with the current state
of treatment for AIDS?

32:14.199 --> 32:17.167
Reasonably.
And you're aware that A.Z.T.
and other drugs

32:17.169 --> 32:19.569
will prolong
the life of these patients?

32:19.571 --> 32:21.571
Yes.

32:21.573 --> 32:25.575
And that people have lived
with AIDS for several years?

32:25.577 --> 32:27.978
Yes, I know that,
but I also know

32:27.980 --> 32:30.213
that in the end,
it's a gruesome death.

32:30.215 --> 32:34.451
People with AIDS do not
go gently into that good night.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.987
But you also know that some gay
men, out of embarrassment,

32:36.989 --> 32:39.222
might not seek treatment,
and commit suicide instead.

32:39.224 --> 32:40.624
Are you in favor of that?

32:42.594 --> 32:47.597
I'm in favor of gay men
taking power over their lives.

32:52.037 --> 32:55.605
Uh, no more questions,
Your Honor.

33:09.021 --> 33:11.221
Excuse me.
Are you Ben Stone?

33:11.223 --> 33:12.289
Yes, sir.

33:13.258 --> 33:15.759
You gay-bashing
son of a bitch!

33:15.761 --> 33:19.629
Leave us alone
to run our own lives<i> and</i> deaths.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.553
It could get worse.

33:26.554 --> 33:28.604
You think
I need a police guard?
You think it's a joke?

33:28.607 --> 33:30.640
Gay activists
don't shoot people.

33:30.642 --> 33:32.709
I wouldn't be so sure
you're safe, Ben.

33:34.046 --> 33:36.480
Jack Curry has AIDS.

33:36.482 --> 33:39.049
Julia Debakey
just released it.

33:41.587 --> 33:45.055
It's time
to bail out of this.

33:52.798 --> 33:55.799
It just seems like revenge
at this point.

33:55.801 --> 33:57.501
Find us something, anything.

33:57.503 --> 33:59.036
Tonight?

33:59.038 --> 34:01.038
Go back over the evidence.

34:01.040 --> 34:05.108
Give us a reason to drop
the charges against Curry.

34:10.783 --> 34:14.718
Anybody got an idea
what we're looking for?

34:14.720 --> 34:16.253
Remeasure everything.

34:16.255 --> 34:18.822
Distance of the body
from the bed.

34:18.824 --> 34:21.124
Blood markings, all of it.

34:21.126 --> 34:23.527
And redust
for prints.

34:23.529 --> 34:26.229
Make a map
of where you get every print.

34:32.438 --> 34:33.670
How's the jaw?

34:33.672 --> 34:35.839
Only hurts
when I prosecute,

34:35.841 --> 34:40.644
so keep me out of court
until the swelling goes down.

34:40.646 --> 34:42.646
Two bookcases
were turned over--

34:42.648 --> 34:43.747
pushed from behind.

34:43.749 --> 34:44.848
Yeah, we redusted.

34:44.850 --> 34:47.818
Full palm prints
on the back of both.

34:47.820 --> 34:51.088
Both sets of prints
belong to Bobby Holland.

34:51.090 --> 34:53.290
Curry's prints weren't on them.

34:53.292 --> 34:56.460
Which means Holland
trashed the place himself

34:56.462 --> 34:58.228
to make it look
like a burglary.

34:58.230 --> 35:01.665
Which means
he wanted to die.

35:02.634 --> 35:04.634
Maybe to us.

35:04.636 --> 35:06.136
Meaning?

35:06.138 --> 35:08.839
It's convincing emotionally,
but not legally.

35:08.841 --> 35:11.875
The prints could have been
put there a year before.

35:11.877 --> 35:15.112
And as to state of mind,
he could have changed it

35:15.114 --> 35:16.847
the micro-second
before Curry pulled the trigger.

35:16.849 --> 35:18.882
But does it convince you?

35:23.222 --> 35:26.723
Curry's already under
a sentence of death.

35:26.725 --> 35:30.694
That's as much payment
as anyone could ask for.

35:31.663 --> 35:34.197
Drop it completely?

35:34.199 --> 35:36.266
It's the right thing to do.

35:36.268 --> 35:38.335
He pleads
to promoting a suicide.

35:38.337 --> 35:41.171
He does no time.

35:41.173 --> 35:43.206
(<i> buzzer</i> )

35:46.512 --> 35:48.311
(<i> buzzer</i> )

35:50.249 --> 35:51.681
Yeah.

36:00.259 --> 36:01.758
You got a copycat.

36:01.760 --> 36:05.762
A woman from Queens
just shot her retarded son.

36:05.764 --> 36:09.733
She says she got the idea
of a mercy killing

36:09.735 --> 36:12.302
from the Holland case.

36:19.645 --> 36:21.344
Well?

36:23.749 --> 36:25.815
We have no choice.

36:30.656 --> 36:32.956
We keep going.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.959
This morning I was just
another ruthless D.A.

36:35.961 --> 36:38.328
Now I'm running
the inquisition.

36:40.265 --> 36:44.734
Mr. Stone, why do you want
to put a dying man in jail?

36:44.736 --> 36:47.270
Mr. Stone,
if you were dying of AIDS

36:47.272 --> 36:48.972
would you want someone
to end your misery?

36:48.974 --> 36:50.740
Would you comment
on that, sir?

36:50.742 --> 36:53.910
Mr. Gordon asks do I want to put
a dying man in jail.

36:53.912 --> 36:55.679
The answer is no,
but we're asking

36:55.681 --> 36:57.214
a more important question
in this courthouse.

36:57.216 --> 36:58.982
Does Jack Curry have the right,
all by himself,

36:58.984 --> 37:01.585
to put a dying man in his grave?

37:01.587 --> 37:05.422
DEBAKEY:
You allow regular customers
to charge their drinks?

37:05.424 --> 37:07.591
MAN:
Well, not exactly charge.

37:07.592 --> 37:09.759
You got to make a
payment on your tab
every once in awhile.

37:09.761 --> 37:12.395
Did Bobby Holland
pay his bill regularly?

37:12.397 --> 37:13.964
He ran a tab
on and off

37:13.966 --> 37:16.666
for the last two
or three years.

37:16.668 --> 37:18.868
Paid a little on it
now and then.

37:18.870 --> 37:21.404
Never let it
get much over 100 bucks.

37:21.406 --> 37:24.674
Did that change, Mr. Rowan?

37:24.676 --> 37:26.643
Couple...

37:26.645 --> 37:28.745
a couple of weeks
before Bobby died

37:28.747 --> 37:33.817
he comes in,
he lays 120 on the bar

37:33.819 --> 37:36.786
and says this is for the bill
plus a tip for me.

37:36.788 --> 37:38.688
I said

37:38.690 --> 37:40.991
"Bobby, what,
you hit the lottery?"

37:40.993 --> 37:46.663
He said, "No. I just want
to pay my bill."

37:48.300 --> 37:52.369
After that, he paid cash.

37:55.007 --> 37:57.274
Your own son.

37:58.944 --> 38:01.778
He handed you the gun.

38:06.818 --> 38:08.785
What did you say?

38:08.787 --> 38:14.924
I told him I didn't think
I could go through with it.

38:14.926 --> 38:16.760
And what did he say?

38:16.762 --> 38:20.330
What words
did he use?

38:20.332 --> 38:23.333
He said, "Dad...

38:23.335 --> 38:27.337
"if you ever wanted
to do anything for me...

38:27.339 --> 38:28.905
do this."

38:28.907 --> 38:31.741
Thank you.

38:31.743 --> 38:34.811
No more questions.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.781
Mr. Holland,
I know this is difficult

38:37.783 --> 38:39.416
so bear with me.

38:39.418 --> 38:42.419
You testified that your son
wanted to shoot himself.

38:42.421 --> 38:44.854
He had a gun.
Why didn't he?

38:52.331 --> 38:54.064
Were his reasons religious?

38:54.066 --> 38:57.400
No.

38:57.402 --> 39:01.504
Was he worried about the pain
he'd cause other people?

39:02.474 --> 39:04.908
No.

39:04.910 --> 39:08.445
Then why do you think your son
was unable to take his life?

39:10.949 --> 39:15.952
He said he was afraid to die.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.787
Thank you, sir.

39:30.102 --> 39:32.969
ROBINETTE:
Debakey's putting Curry
on the stand.

39:32.971 --> 39:35.839
Tough to win the hearts
and minds of a jury

39:35.841 --> 39:38.842
by cross-examining a guy
dying of AIDS.

39:38.844 --> 39:40.910
STONE:
It's still a trial.

39:43.749 --> 39:46.082
DEBAKEY:
And early in the disease,

39:46.084 --> 39:49.085
what symptoms
have you personally witnessed?

39:49.087 --> 39:51.087
Exhaustion, dizziness.

39:51.089 --> 39:53.990
The inability
to hold down food.

39:53.992 --> 39:56.960
Loss of weight
is the most visible symptom.

39:56.962 --> 39:59.028
And later
in the disease?

39:59.030 --> 40:02.966
A friend of mine--
I'd gone to college with him--

40:02.968 --> 40:04.167
he went blind

40:04.169 --> 40:07.504
and then he got pneumonia.

40:07.506 --> 40:10.173
Have you ever heard
what it sounds like

40:10.175 --> 40:13.843
when somebody is drowning?

40:13.845 --> 40:16.112
That's what
he sounded like

40:16.114 --> 40:18.615
for six weeks.

40:18.617 --> 40:22.152
You have been diagnosed
with AIDS, is that correct?

40:22.154 --> 40:23.620
Yes.

40:23.622 --> 40:26.189
What do you hope for?

40:26.191 --> 40:28.858
A cure.

40:28.860 --> 40:32.095
And if one does not

40:32.097 --> 40:33.997
come along soon enough?

40:33.999 --> 40:36.599
Hope I'll be lucky enough

40:36.601 --> 40:41.538
to find someone who will help me
commit suicide.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.175
No more questions.

40:45.177 --> 40:47.577
Your witness.

40:51.483 --> 40:57.120
Mr. Curry, who pulled
the trigger on the gun?

41:00.091 --> 41:03.993
Answer the question, please,
Mr. Curry.

41:06.932 --> 41:08.231
Me.

41:08.233 --> 41:11.935
Did Mr. Holland
have his hand on the gun at all?

41:11.937 --> 41:16.005
No.

41:16.007 --> 41:19.209
No more questions, Your Honor.

41:19.211 --> 41:24.581
JUDGE:
You may step down,
Mr. Curry.

41:24.583 --> 41:27.984
Your Honor,
on the basis of new information

41:27.986 --> 41:30.887
the defense would like to call
an unscheduled witness.

41:30.889 --> 41:32.188
Detective Michael Logan.

41:32.190 --> 41:34.023
Mr. Stone?

41:34.025 --> 41:36.893
No objection, Your Honor.

41:41.233 --> 41:43.600
She has very
good sources.

41:44.503 --> 41:47.036
I'd like to know
who they are.

41:49.608 --> 41:52.208
Do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth,

41:52.210 --> 41:53.643
so help you God?

41:53.645 --> 41:54.644
I do.

41:54.646 --> 41:55.645
State your name.

41:55.647 --> 41:57.948
Michael Logan.

41:57.949 --> 42:00.250
Your Honor, I would like
Detective Logan treated as

42:00.252 --> 42:02.051
a hostile witness.
So noted.

42:04.990 --> 42:08.625
Tell the jury
your profession, please.

42:08.627 --> 42:11.661
I'm a detective with the New
York City Police Department.

42:11.663 --> 42:16.032
Detective Logan,
shortly after this trial began

42:16.034 --> 42:19.235
did you have a conversation
with Assistant District
Attorney Ben Stone

42:19.237 --> 42:20.937
about this case?

42:24.209 --> 42:26.142
Yes, I did.

42:26.144 --> 42:30.280
Tell us the substance
of your conversation.

42:30.282 --> 42:33.149
Do I have to answer that, Judge?

42:33.151 --> 42:35.585
Yes, you do, Detective.

42:38.256 --> 42:40.256
JUDGE:
Answer the question,
Detective.

42:40.258 --> 42:44.260
Mr. Stone said he thought
continuing the prosecution

42:44.262 --> 42:47.030
seemed like revenge to him.

42:47.032 --> 42:49.165
And what was
his solution?

42:49.167 --> 42:53.136
Mr. Stone directed myself
and Sergeant Greevey

42:53.138 --> 42:55.338
to find a reason
for him to drop the charges

42:55.340 --> 42:57.106
against Jack Curry.

43:00.178 --> 43:02.245
(<i> spectators murmuring</i> )

43:10.755 --> 43:12.689
Will the defendant please rise?

43:16.661 --> 43:19.596
On the first count
of the indictment--

43:19.598 --> 43:22.599
the charge of murder
in the second degree--
how does the jury find?

43:22.601 --> 43:24.067
Not guilty.

43:24.069 --> 43:26.135
(<i> courtroom cheering</i>
<i> and clapping</i> )

43:29.774 --> 43:31.674
On the second count--

43:31.676 --> 43:34.077
the charge of conspiracy
in the first degree--

43:34.079 --> 43:35.278
how does the jury find?

43:35.280 --> 43:36.279
Not guilty.

43:36.281 --> 43:38.281
On the third count--

43:38.283 --> 43:39.682
manslaughter
in the first degree--

43:39.684 --> 43:41.284
how does the jury find?

43:41.286 --> 43:42.819
Not guilty.

43:42.821 --> 43:44.387
On the fourth
count, the charge

43:44.389 --> 43:47.090
of criminally negligent
homicide--

43:47.092 --> 43:48.257
how does the jury find?

43:48.259 --> 43:50.777
Not guilty.

43:50.778 --> 43:53.296
On the fifth count--
promoting a suicide attempt--

43:53.298 --> 43:55.798
how does the jury find?

43:55.800 --> 43:57.200
Not guilty.

43:57.202 --> 43:58.701
On the sixth count--

43:58.703 --> 44:00.103
reckless endangerment
in the second degree--

44:00.105 --> 44:02.839
how does the jury find?
Guilty.

44:02.841 --> 44:05.308
That's it?!

44:15.720 --> 44:17.387
Some people aren't going
to be happy.

44:17.389 --> 44:19.689
Depends on
what you want--

44:19.691 --> 44:21.157
vengeance or justice?

44:21.159 --> 44:23.109
Stone! Excuse me.

44:23.110 --> 44:25.060
Did you really think
that I was guilty of murder?

44:25.063 --> 44:27.196
We bring the charges when they
should be brought

44:27.198 --> 44:28.398
and then
let the people decide.

44:28.400 --> 44:32.101
Well, I may not have
a very long life left

44:32.103 --> 44:33.703
but it is<i> my</i> life.

44:33.705 --> 44:35.705
This wasn't a prosecution.

44:35.707 --> 44:38.041
This was a warning,
wasn't it?

44:38.043 --> 44:40.843
To anybody else thinking
about a mercy killing.

44:40.845 --> 44:43.279
What gave you the right
to use me?

44:43.281 --> 44:45.281
Unfortunately, you did.

44:45.283 --> 44:48.184
Not once, not twice,
but three times.

44:49.754 --> 44:51.788
Thanks, Adam.

44:54.292 --> 44:56.292
After all that,
misdemeanor.

44:56.294 --> 44:58.728
Six months suspended
with probation.

44:58.730 --> 45:01.130
No judge will put
Jack Curry

45:01.132 --> 45:03.066
in jail.

45:03.068 --> 45:05.435
If you had gone
only for manslaughter one

45:05.437 --> 45:08.871
the jury probably
would have found him guilty

45:08.873 --> 45:10.873
and he'd
have done time.

45:10.875 --> 45:15.078
I wonder who told a secretary
in your office

45:15.080 --> 45:18.781
to call me about
your conversation with Logan.

45:18.783 --> 45:18.814
I'll have to look into that.
