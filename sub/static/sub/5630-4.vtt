00:02.270 --> 00:03.171
- There's a young girl
and she's my daughter.

00:04.638 --> 00:06.740
She has nobody else.
- You need to leave, now.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.409
- I've been trying to figure out
how to tell you that

00:08.409 --> 00:11.279
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

00:11.279 --> 00:12.980
- The name James Beckett
ring a bell?

00:12.980 --> 00:15.349
- Picked 'em off
on a murder rap 15 years back.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.584
- Her mom is saying
you lied about

00:16.584 --> 00:19.587
witnessing Beckett that night.
She has proof.

00:19.587 --> 00:20.588
- Do you really want to end
your career

00:20.588 --> 00:21.855
for making a false statement?

00:21.855 --> 00:24.392
- To keep a scumbag
like Beckett off my streets?

00:24.392 --> 00:25.759
You bet your ass.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.728
- I look forward to getting
my life back on track.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.063
- Justin?
- Pops, hey.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.065
- I'm really looking forward
to seeing you guys.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.268

Get down!

00:47.548 --> 00:48.782
- Justin!

00:48.782 --> 00:49.883
- Olive, you okay, baby?

00:49.883 --> 00:50.918
[baby crying]

00:50.918 --> 00:53.254
- It's okay.
Shh.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.822
Shh.
- Come on, it's okay.

00:54.822 --> 00:55.989
[baby crying]

00:55.989 --> 00:57.125
It's okay.

*

01:03.564 --> 01:06.134
It's okay.
You're okay.

01:08.802 --> 01:14.542
- This is Sergeant Hank Voight,
badge number 32419.

01:14.542 --> 01:18.679
I need a 10-1
at 2069 West 14th Place.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.149
*

01:25.653 --> 01:27.988
- Hey.
Where is he?

01:27.988 --> 01:29.823
- On his way back from med.

01:29.823 --> 01:31.492
They kept the baby all night
for tests,

01:31.492 --> 01:34.495
but it looks like
everything's gonna be fine.

01:34.495 --> 01:38.966
- What the hell's this?
- Oh, this is the Intelliboard,

01:38.966 --> 01:41.202
and with it we can
cross-correlate in real-time

01:41.202 --> 01:42.503
all of our investigative
efforts,

01:42.503 --> 01:43.637
department-wide.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.773
Got instant GPS tracking,
OCR scanning,

01:45.773 --> 01:47.175
and searchable databases.

01:47.175 --> 01:48.509
IP channeling.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.544
This is next level.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.182
Sergeant, you don't have
to do that.

01:54.182 --> 01:56.217
I started inputting the--

[dark music]

02:01.755 --> 02:03.924
*

02:03.924 --> 02:05.926
- James Beckett.

02:05.926 --> 02:08.262
He's a triple-homicide felon

02:08.262 --> 02:10.931
Olinsky and I put away
15 years ago.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.066
Most of you know he's back out
on the streets again

02:13.066 --> 02:14.835
on a technicality.

02:14.835 --> 02:18.606
Nothing more needs to be said
about that.

02:18.606 --> 02:21.675
What does need to be said

02:21.675 --> 02:24.245
is he tried to kill me,
Olive, Justin,

02:24.245 --> 02:27.748
and my grandson
in front of my house.

02:30.318 --> 02:34.054
So the sooner he is in a box
or a bag, the better.

02:34.054 --> 02:36.357
Am I clear?

02:36.357 --> 02:38.492
- You okay, Hank?
- I will be.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.361
[cell phone rings]

02:40.361 --> 02:43.664
- Olinsky.
- Where is this guy?

02:43.664 --> 02:46.099
I want to know if his
discharge papers from Stateville

02:46.099 --> 02:48.236
listed a residential
forwarding address.

02:48.236 --> 02:50.003
What properties he still owns.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.505
- Hank, we got to roll.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.840
Now.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.735
- Who's the driver?

03:21.735 --> 03:26.340
- Jacob Logan.
Retired CPD.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.141
He was on the team with us
when we took down Beckett.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.913
- Dios mio.

03:45.326 --> 03:50.598
.

03:50.631 --> 03:51.532
- The Wild Bunch of Cicero
rides again, huh?

03:54.402 --> 03:56.003
- Yeah, Cicero.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.037
That was a long time ago.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.906
- You look good.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.808
You look good.
And you don't.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.943
- No?
- He does.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.845
- You heard about Logan?
- Yeah.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.547
That was insanity.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.516
Any idea who?
- James Beckett.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.818
Released from Stateville
yesterday.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.320
- And he took a run at you too?
- Yeah.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.355
All right, we're gonna detail
a couple uniforms to you

04:14.355 --> 04:15.756
for protection.
- Like hell you are.

04:15.756 --> 04:16.957
- It's procedure.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.493
- Who's your detail, Hank?
Al?

04:19.493 --> 04:21.928
I handle myself.

04:23.831 --> 04:27.701
- Listen, you see him, you think
you see him, you call us.

04:27.701 --> 04:28.702
- All right.
- Okay?

04:28.702 --> 04:31.339
And change vehicles
or take the train.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.240
Bombed a couple cars already.

04:33.240 --> 04:36.910
- If I see him I'll call you
guys to clean up the bloodstain.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.380
How about that?

04:39.380 --> 04:40.981
- It's the guy
who was just released?

04:40.981 --> 04:42.416
- Yeah, he went after Voight
and then took out a guy

04:42.416 --> 04:44.385
from me and Al's crew
from back in the day.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.253
- Hey, listen.
Be careful today, okay?

04:46.253 --> 04:47.355
- Yeah, of course.
Of course.

04:47.355 --> 04:48.356
You too, okay?

04:48.356 --> 04:49.657
- Ugh, okay,
come on, come on.

04:49.657 --> 04:50.724
- Come on.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.360
- I just talked to your buddy,
Oliver.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.827
I don't think he's gonna make
it to the bachelor party, bro.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.062
- Why?
- I don't know.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.497
He said he went to
the first two,

04:56.497 --> 04:57.598
nothing came of 'em,

04:57.598 --> 04:59.733
so the third one
kind of seemed pointless.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.268
- Come on.

05:01.268 --> 05:02.269
No, I'm gonna call him.

05:02.269 --> 05:05.373
[beeping]

05:05.373 --> 05:07.408
- They need us upstairs, bro.
[door buzzes]

05:09.477 --> 05:10.744
- What?

05:10.744 --> 05:12.279
- You were engaged twice?

05:12.279 --> 05:13.381
- Yeah.

05:13.381 --> 05:15.416
Before Wendy,
there was Nicole.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.585
You knew that.
- No, I didn't.

05:17.585 --> 05:20.454
- You didn't?

05:20.454 --> 05:21.989
You didn't.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.223
Okay, I have to go upstairs,

05:23.223 --> 05:25.092
but we're gonna talk
about this later.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.694
- Oh yeah.

05:29.763 --> 05:30.898
- Hey, someone went
after Voight?

05:30.898 --> 05:32.433
[door buzzes, opens]
- Starsky and Putz,

05:32.433 --> 05:33.934
get over here.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.035
- You need us upstairs?

05:35.035 --> 05:36.804
- Yeah, something like that.

05:36.804 --> 05:39.006
Pipe bomb fragments found
on the scene at Voight's house

05:39.006 --> 05:42.410
have partial prints belonging to
these two upstanding citizens.

05:42.410 --> 05:45.446
- They look like brothers.

05:45.446 --> 05:48.115
I can see it in their, uh, eyes.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.117
- Enrique and Vicente Dominguez.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.285
Last known address is
1608 Ridgeland.

05:52.285 --> 05:53.687
We want you to sit on the house.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.456
- Should we do a knock-and-talk?

05:55.456 --> 05:57.324
- On a house that could be
filled with explosives.

05:57.324 --> 06:00.060
That's a great idea.
Go do that.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.032
- Hey.
If we see these guys

06:05.032 --> 06:06.434
on the street,
we take 'em.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.235
I don't care if
they're wrapped in dynamite.

06:08.235 --> 06:10.471
- Yeah.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.173
Hey.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.709
Did you know that Adam was
engaged before he was engaged?

06:15.709 --> 06:16.744
- To you?
Yeah.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.579
- No, before that.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.013
- You mean you're the third?

06:20.013 --> 06:22.716
- Yeah, I just found out.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.918
- Just think of it
like the Olympics.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.621
Bronze medal's nothing
to sneeze at.

06:31.191 --> 06:34.261
- She's the real deal,
and you know anything about me,

06:34.261 --> 06:37.565
you know I don't joke
about the sweet science.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.132
Al, I'm talking to you.
- Yeah.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.834
Yeah, as long
as it keeps her parole officer

06:40.834 --> 06:42.169
checking the boxes...

06:42.169 --> 06:43.904
- She's gonna be too tired
to get into trouble.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.939
Trust me.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.114
- Meredith.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.950
- I only came to say my piece
and then I'm leaving.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.152
- Okay.
Okay.

06:59.152 --> 07:02.189
- This girl who says
she's your daughter.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.524
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you even get

07:03.524 --> 07:05.493
a paternity test, Alvin?

07:05.493 --> 07:07.094
- No, no.
No test.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.096
- You're just gonna
take it on faith then?

07:09.096 --> 07:12.866
Willing to blow up
your whole family for that?

07:12.866 --> 07:15.703
- Believe me, I'm not trying
to blow anything up.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.671
- If you have any hope
of getting out of that garage

07:17.671 --> 07:20.240
and getting back in our lives
and keeping us together,

07:20.240 --> 07:22.610
you better find out.

07:25.412 --> 07:27.515
- Show me the warrant.
Oh, that's right.

07:27.515 --> 07:30.383
You don't have one
because my client is protected.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.219
- We're all just friends here,

07:32.219 --> 07:35.222
looking for a lead on
where to find our mutual friend,

07:35.222 --> 07:37.525
James Beckett.

07:37.525 --> 07:39.960
You know, a phone number,
a forwarding address.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.962
Why's it got
to be so adversarial?

07:41.962 --> 07:43.096
- [laughs softly]

07:43.096 --> 07:45.165
You work at
Hank Voight's district?

07:45.165 --> 07:46.433
- That's right.

07:46.433 --> 07:49.369
- That's why it's adversarial.

07:49.369 --> 07:50.638
Shelby, honey.

07:50.638 --> 07:51.939
I said no interruptions.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.975
That means when my door's shut,
it stays shut.

08:13.761 --> 08:15.262
- Where are we at?

08:15.262 --> 08:16.363
- Hank.
- Yeah?

08:16.363 --> 08:17.998
- I think we found a way
to get to Beckett.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.733
- Well, let's have it.
- His lawyer's secretary

08:19.733 --> 08:22.269
gave us the phone number Beckett
used to call the law office

08:22.269 --> 08:23.904
after getting out.
- And we pinged the phone.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.205
It's gone dark.
- Right,

08:25.205 --> 08:26.907
but we checked where and when
the phone was purchased.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.643
It was bought in a convenience
store on Highway 94

08:29.643 --> 08:31.078
along with four other
drop phones.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.780
What are the odds
that five phones would be

08:32.780 --> 08:34.715
purchased by different people
in the same hour?

08:34.715 --> 08:37.317
- I pulled the serial numbers
of all five phones.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.720
One of them is active right now.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.721
I got an address.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.023
- All right.
- Let's go.

08:43.023 --> 08:46.026
[suspenseful music]

08:46.026 --> 08:48.629
*

08:48.629 --> 08:51.031
- This is the address.

08:51.031 --> 08:57.304
*

08:57.304 --> 08:59.773
- That's him.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.214
Move in.

09:07.214 --> 09:10.250
[tires screeching]

09:11.451 --> 09:13.621
- Chicago PD.
Show me your hands.

09:13.621 --> 09:14.955
Show me your hands!

09:14.955 --> 09:17.725
*

09:17.725 --> 09:19.059
Step out of the car.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.629
Get out of the car slowly.

09:21.629 --> 09:22.896
Turn around.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.165
Walk backwards towards me.

09:25.165 --> 09:28.001
Keep walking.
Keep walking.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.970
Keep walking.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.639
Sit down.
Don't move.

09:31.639 --> 09:35.175
- Come on, Beckett.
Get out of the car.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.744
Move.

09:36.744 --> 09:41.114
*

09:41.114 --> 09:42.449
Open the door slowly.

09:42.449 --> 09:45.719
Put your hands
out of the vehicle.

10:02.703 --> 10:02.836
.

10:05.305 --> 10:05.639
- He's in there?

10:07.040 --> 10:08.842
- Slow it down, Hank.
- What, are you kidding me?

10:08.842 --> 10:10.644
He came after
my family, Alvin!

10:10.644 --> 10:13.313
- I know, I know, but the big
eye's watching you on this one.

10:13.313 --> 10:17.651
So anything goes sideways
and it's over for you.

10:17.651 --> 10:19.486
All right?

10:22.790 --> 10:24.024
Okay.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.392
All right.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.873
- Lot of people
sit in that chair

10:39.873 --> 10:42.910
and think how unlucky
they are to be here.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.815
I want you to know
if I had it my way,

10:47.815 --> 10:49.482
you wouldn't have made it
to the District.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.617
- You know what you did.
- Yeah,

10:50.617 --> 10:52.519
I put you away for murder
is what I did.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.454
- Hank.
- Yeah, and enjoyed my money

10:54.454 --> 10:56.656
in the process.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.228
I had 15 years
to think about that.

11:01.228 --> 11:02.462
- Police corruption.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.497
That's real original.

11:05.966 --> 11:09.770
- What money?
Hm?

11:09.770 --> 11:11.404
- Oh, I see.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.173
One of you dirty Cicero cops

11:13.173 --> 11:14.742
took a million dollars
of my money

11:14.742 --> 11:16.343
but didn't cut the others in.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.812
[tense music]

11:18.812 --> 11:20.213
[chuckles]
Perfect.

11:20.213 --> 11:23.616
Greedy pigs
backstabbing their own kind.

11:23.616 --> 11:27.654
*

11:27.654 --> 11:32.659
So if it wasn't you...

11:32.659 --> 11:33.827
it was you.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.628
[door opens]

11:35.628 --> 11:38.631
- We got a problem, Sarge.

11:38.631 --> 11:46.506
*

11:46.506 --> 11:48.608
- I'm gonna assume your phones
are down is why

11:48.608 --> 11:51.244
I wasn't notified immediately
of my client's detention.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.913
- He's under arrest.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.048
- For what?

11:55.048 --> 11:57.918
Are you referring to
involvement in a homicide

11:57.918 --> 11:59.953
and an attempted homicide
that occurred last night

11:59.953 --> 12:01.922
and this morning
between the hours of

12:01.922 --> 12:03.991
9:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.?

12:03.991 --> 12:07.327
Because I'm sure that you
would be interested to know

12:07.327 --> 12:11.464
that my client was at my office
with me and my associates

12:11.464 --> 12:15.302
working all night on the lawsuit
we are filing against the city.

12:15.302 --> 12:18.438
And the personal lawsuit
against you, Sergeant Voight.

12:18.438 --> 12:21.809
Now, are you really sure
you want to keep harassing him?

12:21.809 --> 12:29.817
*

12:31.819 --> 12:34.487
I assume we're free to go?

12:34.487 --> 12:42.529
*

12:50.270 --> 12:53.073
- Oh, hey.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.842
[whispers]
Alvin.

12:54.842 --> 12:55.843
- Yeah, kid?

12:55.843 --> 12:58.078
- I got that test you asked for.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.179
- What?

12:59.179 --> 13:01.281
- The DNA kit.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.851
You just swab the inside
of your mouth,

13:03.851 --> 13:05.552
get a sample from your daughter,
maybe your daughter,

13:05.552 --> 13:06.753
seal it up, send it out.

13:06.753 --> 13:07.754
You'll get the results
in a couple weeks.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.156
- Okay, thanks.

13:09.156 --> 13:12.893
- We got the sealed transcript

13:12.893 --> 13:14.995
from the grand jury trial
on Beckett.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.697
There's an unidentified voice
on the wire.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.599
- Uh-huh.
- After the raid,

13:19.599 --> 13:22.870
this guy's on the tap telling
Beckett that guns, heroin,

13:22.870 --> 13:26.874
and $2 million in cash
were seized by the police.

13:26.874 --> 13:29.642
- Which is, uh,
where there's a discrepancy.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.412
Evidence tags from the raid
show that there was...

13:32.412 --> 13:33.881
one million seized.

13:33.881 --> 13:36.749
- Looks like Beckett was right.

13:36.749 --> 13:39.786
There's a million dollars
missing.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.493
[dark music]

13:46.493 --> 13:54.534
*

14:07.480 --> 14:09.749
- Look, I remember
where your head was back then.

14:09.749 --> 14:12.519
- Meaning?

14:12.519 --> 14:16.056
- Meaning you were jammed up
on some bad investments.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.124
Underwater on your house.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.592
Asked me and Camille
for a floater.

14:19.592 --> 14:20.760
Didn't want Meredith to know.

14:20.760 --> 14:24.531
- Which I paid back
to the penny.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.033
- Al, I'm not gonna
lose respect for you.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.667
I just got to know
what I'm dealing with here

14:27.667 --> 14:30.137
so I can move forward.

14:30.137 --> 14:34.141
*

14:34.141 --> 14:38.611
- You know, I've done a lot
of questionable things.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.248
I'll admit that.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.752
But I've never taken
a damn dime in my life.

14:45.752 --> 14:47.320
- Al.
- No, Hank.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.022
Seriously.

14:50.690 --> 14:53.693
Screw yourself, man.

14:53.693 --> 15:01.801
*

15:10.577 --> 15:18.618
*

15:22.422 --> 15:23.890
- Hey, Burgess, heads-up.

15:23.890 --> 15:24.891
We're on a stakeout.

15:24.891 --> 15:25.993
- I mean, sure.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.460
Adam is really
into the engagement,

15:27.460 --> 15:28.895
but that's a good thing,
right?

15:28.895 --> 15:31.298
Like, so what if he's been
engaged twice before?

15:31.298 --> 15:33.433
I would rather have somebody
excited about wanting

15:33.433 --> 15:36.036
to marry me than moping around
like Debbie Downer.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.404
You know?

15:41.274 --> 15:43.776
I'm asking.
That's me asking.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.078
- Well...

15:45.078 --> 15:47.280
I had a cousin
who was engaged five times.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.782
Never married.
- What d--what does that mean?

15:49.782 --> 15:53.020
- Some people like the movie
trailers more than the movie.

15:56.556 --> 15:57.924
[groans]
- Hey.

15:57.924 --> 15:59.426
How are those shots
going?

15:59.426 --> 16:00.827
- [sighs]

16:00.827 --> 16:02.095
They suck,

16:02.095 --> 16:04.031
but they're worth it.

16:04.031 --> 16:07.500
Andrew will get my bone marrow,
and he'll be a new little man.

16:07.500 --> 16:11.538
As long as he gets a long life,
I don't care.

Yeah, I want to order a taxi.

Good, good.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.180
- Hey, Al.

talk about?

- No.

You know,
I was in a confessional

17:57.377 --> 18:00.647
every other day for about
ten years when I was a kid.

18:00.647 --> 18:03.916

All right, Michelle.

You hit the weights.

18:07.854 --> 18:08.921
Angela, you got speed bag.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.157
- All right.

18:10.157 --> 18:12.792
- Think about what I said.

All right, let's go.

from that batch just lit up,

19:04.211 --> 19:07.247
and you're not gonna believe
who Beckett is calling.

19:12.084 --> 19:14.787

[suspenseful music]

19:24.030 --> 19:32.071

19:49.322 --> 19:52.359
- What the hell?

19:58.298 --> 19:58.431
.

19:59.966 --> 20:00.833
- So you found two million,
vouchered one,

20:01.934 --> 20:02.935
and kept the other
for yourself.

20:02.935 --> 20:03.936
That about right?

20:03.936 --> 20:04.971
- No, that's wrong.
- Hm.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.138
- I've been straight
my entire career.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.840
I live in a little house
in Garfield Ridge

20:07.840 --> 20:09.509

to junior college.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.544
You think that if I came
into a million dollars,

20:11.544 --> 20:13.646
I could sit on it for 15 years
and live like a monk?

20:13.646 --> 20:19.319
- Hey, Schultz, I couldn't give
a good God about the money.

20:19.319 --> 20:22.255
These are calls
Beckett made to your number.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.357
Five of 'em.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.592
He alibis out.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.494
That means somebody else
is out there killing cops.

20:27.494 --> 20:30.297
- Those calls were threats,
Hank.

20:30.297 --> 20:31.798
I swear it.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.132
He said I was next

20:33.132 --> 20:34.601
if I didn't come clean
as to who took his money,

20:34.601 --> 20:38.204
you or Alvin.

20:38.204 --> 20:39.739
This guy Beckett
wants revenge, man.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.541
He said he'd kill my kid
if I didn't find out.

20:41.541 --> 20:44.544
Had Jace's dorm room number
and everything.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.083
I'm telling you straight up.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.052
I didn't know about the missing
million until a day ago.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.220
- So you didn't think to call us

20:54.220 --> 20:55.655
and clue us in that
you had made contact?

20:55.655 --> 20:59.526
- With what Beckett was saying?
How could I trust you?

20:59.526 --> 21:02.595
I sure didn't take his money.

21:02.595 --> 21:06.165
*

21:06.165 --> 21:09.168
So, Hank,
who do you suppose did?

21:09.168 --> 21:11.838

21:30.823 --> 21:32.925
I was 20.
Nicole was 19.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.394
It was a summer of puppy love
that ended with

21:34.394 --> 21:36.563
a $40 ring and six-pack of beer.

21:36.563 --> 21:39.466
It was over before Halloween.

21:39.466 --> 21:40.633
- Is that from Ruzek?

21:40.633 --> 21:42.101
- Yeah.

21:42.101 --> 21:44.837
- Yeah, see?
Nothing to worry about.

21:44.837 --> 21:47.273
- Guess not.

21:51.411 --> 21:52.479
Let me ask you a question.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.780
- Good lord.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.682
- Hey, what you said about Adam
really liking the trailer

21:55.682 --> 21:57.384
more than the movie
got me thinking, okay?

21:57.384 --> 21:58.451
So this is your fault.

21:58.451 --> 22:02.455
- Burgess,
just give him the push test.

22:02.455 --> 22:03.756
- What's that?

22:03.756 --> 22:04.924
- Mention that maybe you guys

22:04.924 --> 22:06.125
should push the wedding date
a year.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.660
If he gives you a lip about it,

22:07.660 --> 22:09.729
then he really
wants to get married.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.398
If he agrees to push it,
then he doesn't.

22:11.398 --> 22:13.433
Simple.

22:15.134 --> 22:17.169
- Yeah.

See, I input
all the old paper transcripts

24:42.549 --> 24:45.084
and ran OCR
so they're searchable now.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.285
- Well, do you have
the grand jury stuff in there?

24:46.285 --> 24:47.654
- Of course.

24:50.022 --> 24:53.025
You can scroll through
by just running your finger.

24:53.025 --> 24:56.696
Here are the testimonies.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.698
- No, this isn't anything.

24:58.698 --> 24:59.832
Do you have the wire in here?

24:59.832 --> 25:01.701
- Mm-hmm.

There.

- See, there's a reference
here to wit.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.254
- Whit.
Hm.

25:22.254 --> 25:23.656
Whit, what's Whit?

25:23.656 --> 25:25.692
A witness?

25:25.692 --> 25:28.861
- Son of a bitch.

25:28.861 --> 25:33.499
Whit was a guy
named Nathan Whitcomb.

25:33.499 --> 25:34.901
- Nathan Whitcomb.

25:34.901 --> 25:36.302
- He supposedly
worked for Beckett,

25:36.302 --> 25:40.172
but we didn't have
anything on him.

25:40.172 --> 25:42.308
Hey.
That's him.

25:42.308 --> 25:43.776
Mouse, do you have
the original wire recordings?

25:43.776 --> 25:45.044
- Well, I--I can get it.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.979
- Call everybody.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.981
Now.
- Yeah.

26:03.830 --> 26:06.065
- Well, it's the only thing
that makes sense.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.934
- All right, Nathan Whitcomb.

26:07.934 --> 26:10.536
Don't let the nice house
fool you.

26:10.536 --> 26:12.038
Hit it.

- Chicago PD! Put your hands
up where I can see them now!

26:33.726 --> 26:35.027
- Don't move! Keep your hands
where I can see them!

26:35.027 --> 26:36.228
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

26:36.228 --> 26:37.897
- Ma'am, I want you to sit down
in the chair

26:37.897 --> 26:39.398
and keep your hands
on the table.

26:39.398 --> 26:40.667
- What is this?

26:40.667 --> 26:44.503
- Your past catching up
with you.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.809
Hm.

26:51.410 --> 26:53.412
- A lawyer.
- Uh-huh.

26:53.412 --> 26:55.281
- My lawyer.
- Right.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.717
- Yeah.
I requested a lawyer.

26:57.717 --> 27:00.519
- Hm.

27:00.519 --> 27:03.022
- He should be here by now.
- No one's coming for you.

27:03.022 --> 27:05.057
- Hey, look. I'd like a chance
to explain this whole thing out.

27:05.057 --> 27:06.558
No, man, no.

27:06.558 --> 27:08.527
I left for like 15 minutes
to get something to eat,

27:08.527 --> 27:10.429
and like, an army of cops
were raiding the place.

27:10.429 --> 27:13.065
They arrested Meachum,
Garrigus, and Wilpon.

27:13.065 --> 27:15.034
- That's you.
- What'd they get?

27:15.034 --> 27:17.770
- That's Beckett.
- 50 bricks, all the weapons.

27:17.770 --> 27:20.206
Two mil in cash.
- Hm.

27:20.206 --> 27:23.475
- All right, now, tell me
when I get off track, Whitcomb.

27:23.475 --> 27:24.844
15 years ago,

27:24.844 --> 27:28.014
we raided your stash house
and confiscated drugs, guns,

27:28.014 --> 27:29.982
and one million in cash,

27:29.982 --> 27:32.518
but you had stashed
another million

27:32.518 --> 27:35.287
of Beckett's money
somewhere else.

27:35.287 --> 27:39.625
Yeah?
I mean, we never found it.

27:39.625 --> 27:41.093
And when it came time
to call the boss,

27:41.093 --> 27:42.261
you said, "Hey, the full boat.

27:42.261 --> 27:45.798
Two million has been
confiscated,"

27:45.798 --> 27:49.235
and then waited
for Beckett to get busted.

27:49.235 --> 27:51.771
He goes away to Stateville...

27:51.771 --> 27:52.905
[laughs softly]

27:52.905 --> 27:54.273
And you make off
with a million dollars

27:54.273 --> 27:57.543
no one even knows is missing.

27:57.543 --> 27:59.946
[laughs]
Besides Beckett.

27:59.946 --> 28:01.447
- Look, I don't know
what you're talking about--

28:01.447 --> 28:04.784
- And now, 15 years later...

28:04.784 --> 28:06.552
one cop is dead.

28:06.552 --> 28:08.320
Another's facing IA charges,

28:08.320 --> 28:11.858
all 'cause the chickens
came home to roost on your lie.

28:11.858 --> 28:13.459
- You're making up lies.

You're covering your own ass.

There was a pipe bomb
tied to the door lock.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.319

28:40.319 --> 28:42.521
Prints on the bomb are a match
for the brothers

28:42.521 --> 28:44.791

arrested today.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.135
Oh.

- You hired kids to pack bombs?

29:00.372 --> 29:01.908
Hm?

29:01.908 --> 29:03.209
For my car?
For Voight's?

29:03.209 --> 29:05.311
- It was Beckett's idea.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.513
He's the one with the vendetta,
not me.

29:07.513 --> 29:09.481
He's insane.
I just facilitated

29:09.481 --> 29:11.383
what he wanted--oh!

29:11.383 --> 29:13.552
You're right, you're right!

29:13.552 --> 29:15.487
I took his money.

29:15.487 --> 29:18.257
If he found out,
he'd kill me.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.692
I don't want any of this, man.
I was out!

29:20.692 --> 29:22.361
- But you were more than happy
to let him believe

29:22.361 --> 29:23.362
that it was us, right?

29:23.362 --> 29:24.363
- I wasn't thinking.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.933
It was all Beckett's!

I swear to you!

- Bait.

anyway, so I'm coming clean.

And now look around.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.351
What do you see?

38:05.351 --> 38:06.485
[bar music playing]

38:06.485 --> 38:09.120
- Well...kind of looks
the same to me, Herrm.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.622
- [scoffs]

38:10.622 --> 38:12.591
I see potential.

38:12.591 --> 38:15.093

38:15.093 --> 38:16.528
- Dr. Charles.

38:16.528 --> 38:17.863
- Detective.

38:17.863 --> 38:18.997
- Thanks, Herrmann.

38:18.997 --> 38:19.998
- You got it, sweetheart.

38:19.998 --> 38:22.233
All right.

38:22.233 --> 38:25.671
- To the elephant.

38:25.671 --> 38:28.907
- The one we eat a piece
at a time instead of whole.

38:28.907 --> 38:31.877
- That's kind of how you get the
son of a bitch out of the room.

38:31.877 --> 38:33.044
- [laughs]
- Right?

38:33.044 --> 38:35.046
- Yeah.

38:35.046 --> 38:42.788
*

38:42.788 --> 38:44.623
We're celebrating.

38:44.623 --> 38:46.091
- What are we celebrating?

38:46.091 --> 38:48.960
- Hank is letting me
move back into my apartment.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.228
He trusts me.

38:50.228 --> 38:52.063
- Wow.
That's huge.

38:52.063 --> 38:53.399
- Yeah.

38:53.399 --> 38:55.601
I think he just wants
his bathroom back, but whatever.

38:55.601 --> 38:58.670
- Well, you can do some serious
damage in a bathroom.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.006
What?
I just meant you're messy.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.708
Like, you're a messy person.

39:02.708 --> 39:03.909
God.

39:03.909 --> 39:06.878
Seriously, though,
this is good.

39:06.878 --> 39:11.783
I was worried that hole you were
digging was gonna be too deep.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.118
- I was lucky.

39:13.118 --> 39:16.154
I had a lot of people
reaching in to pull me out.

39:17.288 --> 39:18.590
[glasses clink]

39:23.328 --> 39:24.730
- Alvin.

39:24.730 --> 39:26.765
- Hank.

39:28.066 --> 39:29.601
- Burgundy, right?

39:29.601 --> 39:32.303
- That a...

39:32.303 --> 39:34.072
that a peace offering?

39:34.072 --> 39:37.543
- I'm in an apologetic mood.

39:37.543 --> 39:39.077
[sighs]

39:39.077 --> 39:42.481
[dark music]

39:42.481 --> 39:44.149
Oh, man.

39:44.149 --> 39:47.018
*

39:47.018 --> 39:48.086
- We're always gonna
be paying for

39:48.086 --> 39:51.557
the debts of the past,
aren't we?

39:51.557 --> 39:52.891
- Yeah.

39:52.891 --> 39:56.127
*

39:56.127 --> 39:58.630
I guess we are.

39:58.630 --> 39:59.798
Hm.

39:59.798 --> 40:01.132
- You know something?

40:01.132 --> 40:04.570
*

40:04.570 --> 40:08.607
I'll do it for the rest
of my days if I have to.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.742
No regrets.

40:10.742 --> 40:14.412
*

40:14.412 --> 40:15.413
- Amen.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.815
- Amen.
