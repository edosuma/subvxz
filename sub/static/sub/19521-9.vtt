00:03.703 --> 00:06.405
<i>- Every day,
we face adversity,</i>

00:06.407 --> 00:11.343
<i>and with each challenge,
we face a choice.</i>

00:11.345 --> 00:12.611
- Hard times are coming.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.079
There's gonna be obstacles
in your way,

00:14.081 --> 00:17.249
<i>whether it's a Warped Wall
or a sick child,</i>

00:17.251 --> 00:19.952
and it's how
you deal with that.

00:19.954 --> 00:21.754
- The strongest person
I've ever met

00:21.756 --> 00:23.522
is an 8-year-old little girl,

00:23.524 --> 00:25.891
<i>and thanks to Zoey,
I refuse to stay down.</i>

00:25.893 --> 00:27.893
<i>The only way I will give up</i>

00:27.895 --> 00:30.062
isf you lock me up
and throw away the key.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.442
<i>- No!</i>

00:43.444 --> 00:45.477
<i>- I will never give up.
- I'm never gonna quit.</i>

00:45.479 --> 00:49.381
That's not me.
That's not how I do things.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.316
<i>- Tonight, 34 athletes</i>

00:51.318 --> 00:54.186
<i>will give it everything
they've got.</i>

00:58.059 --> 00:59.625
<i>- Oh!
- Ooh!</i>

00:59.627 --> 01:01.927
<i>What a save!</i>

01:01.929 --> 01:03.595
<i>Looking stronger than ever.</i>

01:03.597 --> 01:05.030
<i>- When the going gets tough,</i>

01:05.032 --> 01:08.233
you keep going and keep pushing
and do not quit.

01:08.235 --> 01:11.537
- I want to grow up
and be strong and fly.

01:11.539 --> 01:14.740
<i>- Nice.
- So smooth.</i>

01:14.742 --> 01:16.875
<i>- The road to
the "American Ninja Warrior"</i>

01:16.877 --> 01:20.879
<i>national finals
winds back down south.</i>

01:20.881 --> 01:24.349
- I can't wait to face
this city finals course.

01:24.351 --> 01:26.085
- City finals course,
I'm coming for you.

01:34.095 --> 01:35.761
<i>- Start your engines.</i>

01:35.763 --> 01:38.230
<i>We're at the Daytona
International Speedway,</i>

01:38.232 --> 01:40.566
<i>home of the Daytona 500,</i>

01:40.568 --> 01:44.403
<i>and tonight, home for
"American Ninja Warrior."</i>

01:44.405 --> 01:46.572
<i>Hello, everyone, and welcome
to Florida.</i>

01:46.574 --> 01:48.140
I'm Matt Iseman.

01:48.142 --> 01:51.877
- And I'm Akbar Gbajabiamila,
and what a combination.

01:51.879 --> 01:55.781
Our great ninja fans here
at this iconic home of NASCAR.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.149
Look at this.

01:57.151 --> 01:58.617
<i>- And they're in
for something special.</i>

01:58.619 --> 02:00.018
<i>We've got the top men
and woman</i>

02:00.020 --> 02:02.187
<i>in a loaded field tonight,</i>

02:02.189 --> 02:04.957
racing for a spot at the
national finals in Las Vegas.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.792
- And just like NASCAR,

02:06.794 --> 02:08.393
we're probably gonna
see some crashes,

02:08.395 --> 02:10.529
and we're definitely
gonna see some speed.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.498
<i>- We've got the man
who went further</i>

02:12.500 --> 02:15.601
<i>than anyone last season,
Drew Drechsel...</i>

02:15.603 --> 02:17.336
<i>The best ninja on the planet!</i>

02:17.338 --> 02:20.539
<i>Who blew away the field
in qualifying.</i>

02:20.541 --> 02:23.976
<i>The fastest time
by over 30 seconds!</i>

02:23.978 --> 02:27.312
<i>Plus a Miami stuntman,
JJ Woods.</i>

02:27.314 --> 02:29.114
- It's good to be back!

02:29.116 --> 02:30.549
<i>- And the athlete who made
history</i>

02:30.551 --> 02:33.819
<i>on the course last season,
Jessie Graff.</i>

02:33.821 --> 02:37.055
<i>- She is a rock star!</i>

02:37.057 --> 02:39.424
For a look at this longer,
tougher finals course,

02:39.426 --> 02:42.127
let's go down trackside to
the third member of our team,

02:42.129 --> 02:44.062
Kristine Leahy.

02:44.064 --> 02:45.597
- Thanks, Matt.

02:45.599 --> 02:48.634
The course tonight features
ten grueling obstacles.

02:48.636 --> 02:49.935
<i>The first six are the ones</i>

02:49.937 --> 02:51.670
<i>these athletes saw
in qualifying,</i>

02:51.672 --> 02:55.407
<i>including the Wingnuts and
the grueling Rolling Thunder.</i>

02:55.409 --> 02:56.675
<i>Then it's on to the
four obstacles</i>

02:56.677 --> 02:58.310
<i>added for the finals,</i>

02:58.312 --> 03:00.379
<i>starting with
the Salmon Ladder,</i>

03:00.381 --> 03:01.980
followed by a new obstacle,

03:01.982 --> 03:05.584
<i>the Giant Cubes: two
massive Plexiglas structures</i>

03:05.586 --> 03:09.555
<i>with tiny handholds floating
18 feet above the water.</i>

03:09.557 --> 03:11.557
<i>Then they'll have to use
their upper body</i>

03:11.559 --> 03:14.760
<i>to work their way across the
slots on the Circuit Board.</i>

03:14.762 --> 03:17.129
<i>And finally,
one last brutal obstacle,</i>

03:17.131 --> 03:18.864
<i>the Elevator Climb.</i>

03:18.866 --> 03:20.899
<i>Competitors have to
use their upper body</i>

03:20.901 --> 03:24.369
<i>to pump those handles up
the 35-foot chute to the top.</i>

03:24.371 --> 03:26.505
<i>If they can survive
and hit the buzzer,</i>

03:26.507 --> 03:28.207
they've guaranteed
themselves a spot

03:28.209 --> 03:29.608
in Las Vegas.
Matt?

03:29.610 --> 03:31.944
<i>- Thanks, Kristine.

<i>Well, we're down south, and
we're gonna kick things off</i>

03:43.490 --> 03:46.158
<i>with a competitor
from Hueytown, Alabama.</i>

03:46.160 --> 03:50.729
<i>It's the pec-flexing
firefighter, Eddy Stewart,</i>

03:50.731 --> 03:51.997
<i>taking the jacket off
to reveal</i>

03:51.999 --> 03:54.566
<i>that 200-pound physique,</i>

03:54.568 --> 03:56.401
<i>and you know what comes next.</i>

03:56.403 --> 03:58.770
<i>- Oh, and there it is.
- Left, right, double, double.</i>

03:58.772 --> 04:00.539
<i>- And with that big body,</i>

04:00.541 --> 04:01.540
<i>he's always one of the most
entertaining</i>

04:01.542 --> 04:02.741
<i>runs of the night.</i>

04:04.878 --> 04:07.446
<i>Ooh!</i>

04:07.448 --> 04:10.716
<i>- I'm 200 pounds, and so
I'm not your average ninja.</i>

04:10.718 --> 04:12.951
It's a little more difficult
holding your bodyweight up.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.954
<i>- Oh! Oh!
- Right there on his elbow.</i>

04:16.957 --> 04:19.558
<i>- The balance obstacles always
get me real nervous.</i>

04:19.560 --> 04:21.093
<i>- Oh!
- Ooh!</i>

04:21.095 --> 04:23.262
<i>- Hard impact.
- Right there in the obliques!</i>

04:23.264 --> 04:25.564
<i>- During qualifying on Broken
Bridge, I thought I had it.</i>

04:25.566 --> 04:27.332
<i>Maybe I was leaning
forward too much,</i>

04:27.334 --> 04:31.970
<i>and I just did a head dive,
straight over it, and flopped.</i>

04:31.972 --> 04:35.741
<i>- Oh!
- What a Save!</i>

04:35.743 --> 04:37.376
<i>- It would make my year
to hit the buzzer</i>

04:37.378 --> 04:39.211
<i>in the Daytona city finals.</i>

04:39.213 --> 04:41.546
Yeah!
I'm gonna flex my pecs

04:41.548 --> 04:42.681
all the way to Vegas.

04:42.683 --> 04:46.251
Left, right, double, double.

04:46.253 --> 04:48.520
<i>- And Eddy's has a lot of fans
here tonight,</i>

04:48.522 --> 04:50.422
<i>, including his wife Natalie.</i>

04:53.727 --> 04:55.594
<i>- All right, look at him
taking a double step</i>

04:55.596 --> 04:58.130
<i>here after the double bounce
on the pec.</i>

04:58.132 --> 05:01.099
<i>Stewart made it to the
national finals two years ago,</i>

05:01.101 --> 05:02.801
<i>and he's through the Floating
Steps.</i>

05:03.904 --> 05:06.171
<i>And now the Rolling Pin.</i>

05:06.173 --> 05:07.906
<i>You got to wrap those arms
around the cylinders</i>

05:07.908 --> 05:11.209
<i>for that jolting 28-foot ride.</i>

05:11.211 --> 05:12.844
<i>Ooh.
Hard landing,</i>

05:12.846 --> 05:15.847
<i>but that's what we expect
from Eddy Stewart.</i>

05:15.849 --> 05:17.115
- Watch it last!

05:17.117 --> 05:20.152
<i>- He's checking his lip
for blood.</i>

05:20.154 --> 05:21.887
<i>Well, oh, boy.
Let's look at it.</i>

05:21.889 --> 05:23.889
<i>He got his face
against that cylinder,</i>

05:23.891 --> 05:26.258
<i>and when he hits
those jolts, boom!</i>

05:26.260 --> 05:30.929
<i>It's like taking a punch,
and it busted his lip.</i>

05:30.931 --> 05:34.299
<i>- Now this dangerous
new obstacle, the Wingnuts.</i>

05:34.301 --> 05:37.402
<i>Took out about 1/3 of
the competitors in qualifying.</i>

05:37.404 --> 05:39.705
<i>He has to swing sideways
across the three Wingnuts.</i>

05:39.707 --> 05:43.742
<i>It's a challenging move,
but he gets the first one.</i>

05:43.744 --> 05:45.510
<i>- And those transitions...
that's not easy,</i>

05:45.512 --> 05:47.145
<i>especially when
you're 200 pounds,</i>

05:47.147 --> 05:49.648
<i>walking, carrying
all that weight.</i>

05:49.650 --> 05:53.652
<i>That's extremely difficult.
And look at that.</i>

05:53.654 --> 05:54.920
<i>- Very easy for the big man.</i>

05:54.922 --> 05:57.689
<i>On now to the Broken Bridge.</i>

05:57.691 --> 06:00.025
<i>That bloody lip
is still bothering him.</i>

06:00.027 --> 06:02.828
- Breathe now!
<i>- His Alabama buddy,</i>

06:02.830 --> 06:05.731
<i>JoJo Bynum,
giving some advice.</i>

06:05.733 --> 06:09.735
<i>- And remember, he barely
survived this in qualifying.</i>

06:09.737 --> 06:11.470
<i>- Oh!
- Look at that.</i>

06:11.472 --> 06:13.472
<i>A hard impact headfirst.</i>

06:13.474 --> 06:17.976
<i>Once again, Eddy Stewart
is just beating himself up.</i>

06:17.978 --> 06:19.611
<i>- Well, he was just
stumbling forward,</i>

06:19.613 --> 06:21.847
<i>so he dives over
the last step,</i>

06:21.849 --> 06:23.982
<i>and he lands headfirst
on the pad.</i>

06:23.984 --> 06:27.052
<i>He's going to have some
bruises after this one.</i>

06:27.054 --> 06:29.588
<i>- And you can really see
that blood on his lip,</i>

06:29.590 --> 06:31.223
<i>but things don't get any
easier.</i>

06:31.225 --> 06:34.659
<i>Now it's Rolling Thunder,
which just wears you down.</i>

06:34.661 --> 06:37.028
<i>- I expect to see him
go fast here.</i>

06:37.030 --> 06:39.798
<i>Get it moving.</i>

06:39.800 --> 06:43.068
<i>You can see JoJo down
there, JoJo screaming to him,</i>

06:43.070 --> 06:45.070
<i>"Move, move!
Get that thing moving!"</i>

06:45.072 --> 06:48.540
<i>- 200 pounds, a lot of weight
to carry across this obstacle.</i>

06:48.542 --> 06:51.042
<i>23 feet across.</i>

06:51.044 --> 06:53.678
<i>- Oh, that's that 'Bama
strength. 'Bama strong.</i>

06:53.680 --> 06:55.947
<i>- And just telling him
to move it, keep it moving.</i>

06:55.949 --> 06:57.449
<i>- You know how they do
in Alabama.</i>

06:57.451 --> 07:00.719
<i>He's rolling with it.
He's rolling with it.</i>

07:00.721 --> 07:03.622
<i>- Roll tide,
roll this thunder.</i>

07:03.624 --> 07:05.557
- You can jump!
- You can jump!

07:05.559 --> 07:08.860
<i>- Going for the dismount,
and he's got it.</i>

07:08.862 --> 07:10.462
- Whoo!
- Yes! Yes!

07:10.464 --> 07:12.564
<i>- He's bloodied,
but Eddy Stewart</i>

07:12.566 --> 07:14.866
<i>now facing the Warped Wall.</i>

07:14.868 --> 07:17.702
- I know your limbs hurting.
- Go! Get up the wall!

07:17.704 --> 07:19.838
- A little blood in your mouth?
- That's good.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.140
He got busted
right in the mouth.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.542
- And he's up it.

07:23.544 --> 07:26.111
Eddy Stewart, our first
runner, is gonna give us

07:26.113 --> 07:28.447
<i>our first look at
these back-half obstacles.</i>

07:28.449 --> 07:31.383
<i>These final four are
upper-body-intensive,</i>

07:31.385 --> 07:33.285
<i>and it starts here
with the Salmon Ladder.</i>

07:34.354 --> 07:36.621
- Whoo!

07:36.623 --> 07:38.323
- Come on, man.
- Breathe!

07:38.325 --> 07:40.358
Breathe. Let's go.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.594
<i>- Got to jump it four rungs
to the top.</i>

07:42.596 --> 07:44.963
<i>Here he goes. Here he goes.</i>

07:44.965 --> 07:47.432
<i>- This is where you want to
use all the muscle.</i>

07:47.434 --> 07:49.601
<i>You got 'em; use 'em.
That's it!</i>

07:49.603 --> 07:51.503
<i>- Look at this.
- Found his second wind.</i>

07:51.505 --> 07:53.839
<i>- Yeah.
- I see you, Eddy Stewart!</i>

07:53.841 --> 07:55.707
<i>- And he completes
the Salmon Ladder,</i>

07:55.709 --> 07:58.643
<i>moving on to the new
obstacle, the Giant Cubes.</i>

07:58.645 --> 08:01.046
<i>- Let me tell you,
it's tough being the first.</i>

08:01.048 --> 08:03.014
<i>He hasn't seen
anyone else try this.</i>

08:03.016 --> 08:05.116
<i>He's gonna have
to figure it out.</i>

08:05.118 --> 08:06.718
<i>- He's trying to use
those small handholds</i>

08:06.720 --> 08:09.554
<i>to get up to the top and
use that red ledge up there</i>

08:09.556 --> 08:12.524
<i>to work his way around
the box, but that is not easy.</i>

08:12.526 --> 08:15.760
- Breathe!

08:15.762 --> 08:17.796
<i>- You can see
he's really struggling,</i>

08:17.798 --> 08:21.700
<i>holding his 200-pound body
on those tiny handholds,</i>

08:21.702 --> 08:23.401
<i>trying to reach up.</i>

08:23.403 --> 08:24.903
<i>- Pull yourself up.
- Tag it!</i>

08:24.905 --> 08:27.138
<i>Oh!</i>

08:27.140 --> 08:29.241
<i>- Splashes down,
but the firefighter</i>

08:29.243 --> 08:31.409
<i>makes it to
the eighth obstacle,</i>

08:31.411 --> 08:35.714
<i>and as always, Eddy Stewart
left it all on the course.</i>

08:35.716 --> 08:38.015
<i>- Big Eddy took a shot
at the rolling pin,</i>

08:38.018 --> 08:40.784
<i>and the face plant
on the Broken Bridge.</i>

08:40.787 --> 08:42.721
<i>The blood didn't stop
Eddy Stewart,</i>

08:42.722 --> 08:44.756
<i>but the Giant Cubes did,</i>

08:44.758 --> 08:49.427
<i>as he just gassed out
trying to pull himself up.</i>

08:49.429 --> 08:52.664
- Got tired.
- Super tired.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.766
Whoo!

08:54.768 --> 08:59.404
<i>- Tonight, ninja favorites hit
the starting line in Daytona,</i>

08:59.406 --> 09:01.106
<i>including Jessie Graff.</i>

09:01.108 --> 09:04.509
<i>- She is a beast!
- JJ Woods.</i>

09:04.511 --> 09:07.512
- I'm back, baby!
<i>- And Drew Drechsel.</i>

09:07.514 --> 09:10.448
<i>The real-life ninja!</i>

09:10.450 --> 09:12.717
- Daytona city finals,
start your engines.

09:12.719 --> 09:16.288
<i>- But up next, one of the
most inspirational stories</i>

09:16.290 --> 09:18.890
<i>we've ever had on
"American Ninja Warrior,"</i>

09:18.892 --> 09:23.361
<i>how one family came back from
a heartbreaking loss.</i>

09:23.363 --> 09:24.663
- It's definitely gonna be
a special moment

09:24.665 --> 09:26.965
when I see them saying,
"Go, Daddy, go!"

09:26.967 --> 09:28.433
Come on, buddy.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.669
<i>- When "American Ninja
Warrior" returns.</i>

09:34.006 --> 09:36.741
<i>- Welcome back to
"American Ninja Warrior."</i>

09:36.743 --> 09:38.643
<i>While we were away,
three more athletes took</i>

09:38.645 --> 09:41.179
<i>on this Daytona
city finals course.</i>

09:41.181 --> 09:43.748
<i>Rookie Cedric Idudu came out</i>

09:43.750 --> 09:46.885
<i>with the flag and wardrobe
of his native Nigeria.</i>

09:46.887 --> 09:49.154
<i>- But when you take of the
dashiki, you mean business.</i>

09:49.156 --> 09:50.789
<i>- The Atlanta IT consultant</i>

09:50.791 --> 09:54.092
<i>quickly went offline
at the Wingnuts.</i>

09:54.094 --> 09:57.095
<i>- Ooh!
- Idudu doesn't do it.</i>

09:57.097 --> 09:59.264
<i>Haunted house makeup artist
Bree Widener</i>

09:59.266 --> 10:02.000
<i>and her scary-looking
co-workers were back</i>

10:02.002 --> 10:04.069
<i>for another shot
at the course.</i>

10:04.071 --> 10:05.670
<i>- Yeah, I get my eyes
on you, Bree.</i>

10:05.672 --> 10:07.973
<i>- The 23-year-old from
Augusta, Georgia,</i>

10:07.975 --> 10:10.809
<i>looked strong early,
but just as in qualifying,</i>

10:10.811 --> 10:13.678
<i>she was worn down
by Rolling Thunder.</i>

10:13.680 --> 10:15.780
<i>No!</i>

10:15.782 --> 10:19.084
<i>- Widener once again out
on the Rolling Thunder.</i>

10:19.086 --> 10:21.252
<i>- Greenville,
South Carolina's Brett Sims</i>

10:21.254 --> 10:24.289
<i>made an impressive leap
to get past Rolling Thunder.</i>

10:24.291 --> 10:25.624
<i>- Looked like he almost got
a swing right there.</i>

10:25.626 --> 10:28.026
<i>- Wow!
- But in a major shock,</i>

10:28.028 --> 10:29.928
<i>this seven-time veteran
slipped up</i>

10:29.930 --> 10:31.262
<i>on the Salmon Ladder.</i>

10:31.264 --> 10:33.198
<i>Oh. No!</i>

10:33.200 --> 10:35.166
<i>And that's how quickly
it can end.</i>

10:35.168 --> 10:37.936
<i>Disappointment for Brett Sims.</i>

10:37.938 --> 10:40.572
<i>Well, if you're a fan
of the hit show,</i>

10:40.574 --> 10:42.440
<i>"This Is Us,"
or even if you're not,</i>

10:42.442 --> 10:44.576
<i>you'll want to meet
our next competitor.</i>

10:44.578 --> 10:48.013
<i>This is Nashville
bus driver Josh Butler,</i>

10:48.015 --> 10:51.249
<i>Right there he's saying
"Dad" in sign language.</i>

10:51.251 --> 10:53.852
<i>That's to communicate with
his two-year-old son Braxtel.</i>

10:53.854 --> 10:56.321
<i>On "This Is Us,"
a couple adopts a baby</i>

10:56.323 --> 10:58.223
<i>after a terrible loss...
the same thing</i>

10:58.225 --> 11:01.459
<i>Josh and his wife have done.</i>

11:01.461 --> 11:05.697
<i>- Hi, Dewey.
- Good morning, Dewey.</i>

11:05.699 --> 11:09.734
<i>- Our first son, Dewey,
was born in May 2015</i>

11:09.736 --> 11:12.003
<i>with a genetic disorder</i>

11:12.005 --> 11:14.572
<i>that had never been
documented before.</i>

11:14.574 --> 11:20.612
He had trouble breathing
and he had trouble eating.

11:20.614 --> 11:25.150
<i>They were definitely some
dark times, some sad times.</i>

11:26.653 --> 11:27.986
Yeah.

11:29.556 --> 11:33.324
<i>Basically, all our waking
hours were in the hospital.</i>

11:33.326 --> 11:36.961
That's where he passed away
after 132 days.

11:40.967 --> 11:45.503
<i>- His little body had been
working so hard.</i>

11:47.074 --> 11:49.007
So hard.

11:53.814 --> 11:57.215
<i>But we knew that God was
preparing us</i>

11:57.217 --> 12:00.418
<i>for something with Dewey.</i>

12:00.420 --> 12:03.221
<i>- One of the nurses from
the hospital told us</i>

12:03.223 --> 12:07.258
<i>that there was a baby
on the fifth floor, Braxtel.</i>

12:07.260 --> 12:09.828
<i>His family had deserted him,
really,</i>

12:09.830 --> 12:16.101
and he had some of the same
illnesses that Dewey did.

12:16.103 --> 12:18.503
<i>- Right away, I knew it
was an answer to a prayer.</i>

12:18.505 --> 12:21.239
<i>This baby needed a home,
needed a family.</i>

12:21.241 --> 12:27.045
<i>- And so we met him, and
we fell in love with him,</i>

12:27.047 --> 12:29.114
<i>so we fostered
and then adopted him.</i>

12:32.185 --> 12:34.486
<i>Eventually, our new son,
Braxtel,</i>

12:34.488 --> 12:35.954
we got to bring him home.

12:35.956 --> 12:39.824
Come to Mommy and Daddy.
Come on, buddy.

12:39.826 --> 12:42.393
<i>- He's experienced such
healing,</i>

12:42.395 --> 12:43.695
such supernatural healing.

12:43.697 --> 12:45.263
We are so grateful.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.031
- Here's the one thing you need
to know about the claw,

12:47.033 --> 12:48.900
is it's gonna get you
in the tum!

12:48.902 --> 12:50.602
It's gonna get you in the tum!

12:50.604 --> 12:51.970
<i>It's definitely gonna be
a special moment</i>

12:51.972 --> 12:53.438
<i>when I'm running the course</i>

12:53.440 --> 12:55.473
<i>and I see them down
there... see them smiling</i>

12:55.475 --> 12:57.609
and saying, "Go, Daddy, go!"

12:57.611 --> 12:59.277
<i>And I'm gonna be
thinking about Dewey</i>

12:59.279 --> 13:01.346
<i>and thinking about Braxtel,
and it's past his bedtime,</i>

13:01.348 --> 13:02.981
<i>but I'll let him stay up
this one time.</i>

13:06.419 --> 13:09.687
<i>- You see Braxtel has that
special breathing tube</i>

13:09.689 --> 13:11.656
<i>to make sure
he gets enough oxygen.</i>

13:11.658 --> 13:14.492
<i>Because of that tube, Braxtel
isn't able to speak yet.</i>

13:14.494 --> 13:16.494
<i>That's why they communicate
in sign language.</i>

13:19.266 --> 13:21.800
<i>Someone should nominate this
guy for Father of the Year.</i>

13:21.802 --> 13:23.668
<i>Not only does he help
take care of Braxtel;</i>

13:23.670 --> 13:26.171
<i>he drives a bus for
a nonprofit in Nashville</i>

13:26.173 --> 13:28.339
<i>that helps
underprivileged kids.</i>

13:28.341 --> 13:31.876
<i>- This is a 31-year-old
ninja rookie.</i>

13:31.878 --> 13:36.114
<i>Qualifying was his first time
on a course.</i>

13:36.116 --> 13:37.782
<i>- He's through
the first obstacle,</i>

13:37.784 --> 13:40.585
<i>and moves up
to the rolling pin.</i>

13:40.587 --> 13:44.055
<i>- Oh, look at this.
- He's wrapping around his knee.</i>

13:44.057 --> 13:45.690
<i>That keeps his leg
from pulling him off.</i>

13:45.692 --> 13:50.228
<i>- Ooh, but that technique
makes for a hard landing.</i>

13:50.230 --> 13:53.998
<i>And Mom and Braxtel giving him
that sign for "Daddy,"</i>

13:54.000 --> 13:56.601
<i>as he faces off against
the Wingnuts.</i>

13:56.603 --> 13:58.036
<i>- And this could be a tough
one for someone</i>

13:58.038 --> 14:00.271
<i>who doesn't have
a lot of obstacle experience.</i>

14:00.273 --> 14:02.740
<i>- He built a few obstacles
in his backyard,</i>

14:02.742 --> 14:04.409
<i>but between his job
and his family,</i>

14:04.411 --> 14:06.044
<i>he hasn't got
much time to train,</i>

14:06.046 --> 14:08.213
<i>so it's impressive
he's made it this far.</i>

14:08.215 --> 14:12.717
<i>- Oh! Come on,
come on, come on. Ooh!</i>

14:12.719 --> 14:15.920
<i>- Having trouble getting that
left hand up. He's got it.</i>

14:15.922 --> 14:18.256
- You got it, Josh.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.294
<i>- Nice!</i>

14:23.296 --> 14:24.696
<i>- Barely making those
transitions,</i>

14:24.698 --> 14:26.831
<i>and you can see
there's not a lot to grab</i>

14:26.833 --> 14:28.366
<i>on to... only about two inches</i>

14:28.368 --> 14:30.668
<i>for your fingers
in those handholds.</i>

14:30.670 --> 14:31.903
<i>- Get off there!</i>

14:31.905 --> 14:35.907
<i>- But Josh Butler gets
through.</i>

14:35.909 --> 14:40.144
<i>On, now, to the Broken Bridge.</i>

14:40.146 --> 14:42.113
<i>- Come on. You got it.
- You got it.</i>

14:42.115 --> 14:43.982
<i>You got it!
Whoo!</i>

14:43.984 --> 14:47.252
<i>- Excellent balance
for the Butler.</i>

14:47.254 --> 14:48.820
- I need you!

14:48.822 --> 14:50.922
<i>- And he's telling the crowd,
"I need you!"</i>

14:50.924 --> 14:52.891
- Go, Josh!

14:52.893 --> 14:55.026
<i>- That's because this next
obstacle, the Rolling Thunder,</i>

14:55.028 --> 14:57.562
<i>is where he went out
in qualifying.</i>

14:57.564 --> 14:59.831
<i>Only made it about
halfway down the track.</i>

14:59.833 --> 15:03.268
<i>- And we saw this take out
so many six weeks ago.</i>

15:03.270 --> 15:05.737
<i>- He's moving a lot quicker
than he was in qualifying.</i>

15:05.739 --> 15:08.273
<i>Can he get that hundred-pound
Rolling Thunder moving?</i>

15:08.275 --> 15:09.574
<i>- All right, come on.
- Go get it.</i>

15:09.576 --> 15:12.176
<i>- Good power out
of the bus driver.</i>

15:12.178 --> 15:16.481
<i>- See what happens when
you call the Butler?</i>

15:16.483 --> 15:18.950
<i>He comes.
He's at your service.</i>

15:18.952 --> 15:22.820
<i>Yes!
Serve this Rolling Thunder!</i>

15:22.822 --> 15:25.990
<i>- Fighting for it. That grip's
starting to give out.</i>

15:25.992 --> 15:29.093
<i>Looking for the dismount.</i>

15:29.095 --> 15:30.962
- Keep going! Keep going!
- Keep going! Keep going!

15:30.964 --> 15:34.632
<i>- Still needs a few more feet.
- Okay, come on, Josh.</i>

15:34.634 --> 15:37.135
<i>- As you can see, as he sways,
the wheel counteracts it,</i>

15:37.137 --> 15:40.705
<i>moving the opposite
direction.</i>

15:40.707 --> 15:43.975
<i>- His wife's telling him,
"Turn around and go forward."</i>

15:43.977 --> 15:46.110
<i>- I love it. The husband
listening to his wife</i>

15:46.112 --> 15:50.248
<i>in the middle of his run.</i>

15:50.250 --> 15:53.017
<i>- And he's got it!
- Yes!</i>

15:53.019 --> 15:55.720
Rolling Thunder just got
served by the Butler!

15:55.722 --> 15:58.589
<i>- And look, that's sign
language for "thank you."</i>

15:58.591 --> 16:00.692
<i>He's thanking his son,
Braxtel,</i>

16:00.694 --> 16:04.228
<i>and really the whole audience
for helping him get through.</i>

16:04.230 --> 16:07.865
<i>Now for the first time ever
he's facing the Warped Wall.</i>

16:07.867 --> 16:10.168
Beat that wall!
Beat that wall!

16:10.170 --> 16:14.205
- Here we go!
- Oh, yeah!

16:14.207 --> 16:16.374
No problem on the Warped Wall.

16:16.376 --> 16:19.010
- And yeah. Wow.

16:19.012 --> 16:22.280
<i>- And again says "thank you."</i>

16:22.282 --> 16:23.281
- Whoo!

16:23.283 --> 16:25.116
<i>- And now Josh Butler's</i>

16:25.118 --> 16:27.685
<i>gonna take on the back half
of this course.</i>

16:27.687 --> 16:29.520
<i>- Well, he's breathing
heavily.</i>

16:29.522 --> 16:30.621
<i>He looks a little winded,
Matt.</i>

16:30.623 --> 16:33.791
- Josh, backyard.
- Backyard all day.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.393
<i>- His wife saying "backyard,"</i>

16:35.395 --> 16:36.594
<i>a reference to
the Salmon Ladder</i>

16:36.596 --> 16:37.895
<i>he built in their backyard,</i>

16:37.897 --> 16:39.364
<i>but it's always tougher</i>

16:39.366 --> 16:41.666
<i>after doing the six obstacles
before this.</i>

16:41.668 --> 16:44.268
<i>- Ooh, ooh! Come on!</i>

16:44.270 --> 16:45.570
<i>- Got that bar uneven.</i>

16:45.572 --> 16:46.904
<i>You got to fight to
correct it.</i>

16:46.906 --> 16:48.106
<i>- Get that auto correct.
- Auto correct.</i>

16:48.108 --> 16:49.107
<i>Nice.</i>

16:49.109 --> 16:51.009
<i>- No!
- Ooh!</i>

16:51.011 --> 16:55.146
<i>- Josh Butler just gives out
on the Salmon Ladder,</i>

16:55.148 --> 16:57.682
<i>and yet what a courageous run
in front of his son.</i>

16:57.684 --> 16:59.217
- Good job, Dad.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.785
<i>- It really was, Matt.</i>

17:00.787 --> 17:02.153
<i>He got past Rolling Thunder,</i>

17:02.155 --> 17:04.422
<i>which took him out
in qualifying,</i>

17:04.424 --> 17:06.156
<i>but at the Salmon Ladder,</i>

17:06.159 --> 17:09.160
<i>you could see his fingers peel
off the bar after one jump.</i>

17:09.162 --> 17:10.595
<i>He was exhausted.</i>

17:10.597 --> 17:11.896
<i>Let's go down to Kristine</i>

17:11.897 --> 17:14.398
<i>for the POM post-run
interview.</i>

17:14.401 --> 17:16.166
- Josh, let's first go back
to the Rolling Thunder.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.301
How were you able to
get through it tonight?

17:18.304 --> 17:20.003
- You know, me and my wife
talk about it,

17:20.006 --> 17:21.271
and Braxtel talked about it,

17:21.273 --> 17:22.740
and how he gets
stronger every day,

17:22.742 --> 17:24.474
and so I just got through it.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.777
<i>- What did you hope
to accomplish</i>

17:25.779 --> 17:27.278
<i>by being here tonight?</i>

17:27.280 --> 17:29.914
- Just to share a little bit
about my family's story

17:29.916 --> 17:32.583
and, you know, hope,
perseverance, faith...

17:32.585 --> 17:34.986
it's all important,

17:34.988 --> 17:36.721
and dreaming big dreams
is also important too.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.389
- That's a great message.
- Thank you so much.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.124
- Thank you.
- Guys?

17:40.126 --> 17:46.464
<i>- Thanks, Kristine. Braxtel's
got to be proud of his dad.</i>

17:46.466 --> 17:49.033
<i>Well, a lot of ninja
heavyweights here in Daytona,</i>

17:49.035 --> 17:51.669
<i>including eight-time veteran
Travis Rosen.</i>

17:51.671 --> 17:53.371
<i>His run's coming up later.</i>

17:53.373 --> 17:56.541
<i>Then, get ready
for some fast times.</i>

17:56.543 --> 17:59.477
<i>- Whoo!
- Wow!</i>

17:59.479 --> 18:03.915
<i>As movie lookalike Rigel
Henry hits the course.</i>

18:03.917 --> 18:05.550
- Hey, bud. Let's ninja!

18:05.552 --> 18:06.984
Whoo!

18:06.986 --> 18:09.620
<i>- When "American Ninja
Warrior" returns.</i>

18:12.124 --> 18:15.093
<i>- Welcome back to
the Daytona city finals.</i>

18:15.095 --> 18:16.561
<i>While we were away,</i>

18:16.563 --> 18:18.863
<i>two more ninjas
took their shot at the course.</i>

18:18.865 --> 18:20.698
- All right! All right!

18:20.700 --> 18:24.702
<i>- Hampton, Georgia's Ricky Vu
had dancing feet at the start.</i>

18:24.704 --> 18:26.871
<i>- He's so happy.
- But the fun faded quickly.</i>

18:26.873 --> 18:28.439
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

18:28.441 --> 18:30.908
<i>As he developed cramps
in both legs</i>

18:30.910 --> 18:32.910
<i>and had to be
carried off the course.</i>

18:32.912 --> 18:35.113
<i>He is in a lot of pain.</i>

18:35.115 --> 18:37.482
<i>The pride of Possum Kingdom,
South Carolina,</i>

18:37.484 --> 18:39.083
<i>Bootie Cothran,</i>

18:39.085 --> 18:41.886
<i>was making his first
appearance in the city finals.</i>

18:41.888 --> 18:43.354
<i>48 years old.</i>

18:43.356 --> 18:45.790
<i>This guy seems to get
better every season.</i>

18:45.792 --> 18:48.493
<i>With his Bootie bandwagon
cheering him on,</i>

18:48.495 --> 18:51.963
<i>the 105-pound athlete
made it to Rolling Thunder.</i>

18:51.965 --> 18:53.331
<i>Oh!</i>

18:53.333 --> 18:55.867
<i>The same place
he fell in qualifying.</i>

18:55.869 --> 18:58.436
- That Rolling Thunder's
got my number.

18:58.438 --> 18:59.704
<i>- Well, our next athlete
weighs</i>

18:59.706 --> 19:01.539
<i>almost twice as much
as Bootie,</i>

19:01.541 --> 19:03.741
<i>and he's got ice in his veins.</i>

19:03.743 --> 19:07.545
<i>This is Michael Johnson
from Stone Mountain, Georgia,</i>

19:07.547 --> 19:10.314
<i>and you can see him blow
a kiss to his late mother.</i>

19:10.316 --> 19:14.485
<i>She's one of the three women
who helped raise him.</i>

19:14.487 --> 19:16.287
<i>- I'm running this course
mainly for three women</i>

19:16.289 --> 19:17.355
in my life.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.090
First off, it would be my mom.

19:19.092 --> 19:21.792
<i>She died due
to vehicular homicide.</i>

19:21.794 --> 19:23.628
<i>I was six years old.</i>

19:23.630 --> 19:25.830
<i>After my mom passed,
my aunt Charmaine,</i>

19:25.832 --> 19:27.298
she stepped up big time.

19:27.300 --> 19:31.169
- I know you're gonna be
the next Ninja Warrior.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.503
<i>- She filled in
the mother role.</i>

19:32.505 --> 19:34.172
She still pays my phone bill.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.840
<i>And last but not least,
my grandmother.</i>

19:35.842 --> 19:38.809
She used to hate this.
Watch.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.311
<i>She's one of the
strongest people I know.</i>

19:40.313 --> 19:42.713
<i>She came straight off
the boat from Jamaica.</i>

19:42.715 --> 19:46.784
<i>They played such
a big role in my life.</i>

19:46.786 --> 19:50.655
<i>- This guy is jacked,
in tremendous shape.</i>

19:50.657 --> 19:53.791
- In qualifying a few weeks
ago, it was super surreal.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.726
<i>- Somebody came here
ready as a rookie.</i>

19:55.728 --> 19:56.761
<i>- And in my mind,
I'm just going,</i>

19:56.763 --> 19:59.030
"Holy snap. I'm here."

20:00.266 --> 20:02.066
Let's go!

20:02.068 --> 20:03.668
As soon as I got up on the wall

20:03.670 --> 20:04.735
I had to let the crowd know.

20:04.737 --> 20:11.175
I have ice in my veins!

20:11.177 --> 20:13.611
It was a beautiful moment.

20:13.613 --> 20:16.914
<i>I think that my mom is
extremely elated right now.</i>

20:16.916 --> 20:18.816
<i>She's looking down smiling
and is like,</i>

20:18.818 --> 20:20.851
<i>"That's my son,
and I put ice there."</i>

20:20.853 --> 20:24.589
<i>This city finals, I'm going
to run this course for them.</i>

20:24.591 --> 20:28.326
<i>Tell them, Mom. Blood doesn't
flow through these veins.</i>

20:28.328 --> 20:29.794
<i>Ice does.</i>

20:31.564 --> 20:33.164
<i>- What an impressive kid.</i>

20:33.166 --> 20:35.866
<i>He's on the course now,
on the Wingnuts.</i>

20:35.868 --> 20:37.768
<i>- Ooh!</i>

20:37.770 --> 20:41.339
<i>That was a near fall
for Michael Johnson.</i>

20:41.341 --> 20:44.408
<i>- Swinging wildly, but going
for the dismount.</i>

20:44.410 --> 20:47.044
<i>Oh, and he survives,
making it interesting.</i>

20:47.046 --> 20:48.679
<i>- Well, with a name
like Michael Johnson,</i>

20:48.681 --> 20:50.715
<i>better sprint through here
on Broken Bridge.</i>

20:50.717 --> 20:53.184
<i>High knees. High knees.
High knees.</i>

20:53.186 --> 20:54.185
<i>Light on your feet.
High knees.</i>

20:54.187 --> 20:57.088
<i>He just jumped over it.</i>

20:57.090 --> 20:58.656
He gets me worked up.

20:58.658 --> 21:01.125
Every time he screams like
that, he gets me worked up.

21:01.127 --> 21:03.361
<i>- Well, well ahead of his pace
in qualifying,</i>

21:03.363 --> 21:04.962
<i>and the shirt comes off.</i>

21:04.964 --> 21:06.864
<i>His aunt and grandma are
watching</i>

21:06.866 --> 21:08.266
<i>back in New York City,</i>

21:08.268 --> 21:10.635
<i>but he's got some friends
on the sideline.</i>

21:10.637 --> 21:12.470
<i>Hard to believe this guy</i>

21:12.472 --> 21:14.272
<i>started training just
a couple years ago.</i>

21:14.274 --> 21:18.542
<i>- That's right.
- Now, he deadlifts 500 pounds.</i>

21:18.544 --> 21:20.044
<i>That's amazing.</i>

21:20.046 --> 21:21.445
<i>- 24 years old.</i>

21:21.447 --> 21:23.648
<i>This guy is a specimen.</i>

21:23.650 --> 21:27.451
<i>- Yes, he is, Matt.</i>
- You got it.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.086
You got it.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.621
Whoo!

21:30.623 --> 21:33.424
<i>- And really moving
the Rolling Thunder.</i>

21:33.426 --> 21:36.727
<i>- Tremendous power out of MJ.
- Nice tempo.</i>

21:36.729 --> 21:38.829
- All your might.
- Let's go, man. Come on.

21:38.831 --> 21:41.032
<i>- Keep that pace going.
- Keep that pace.</i>

21:41.034 --> 21:43.100
- Keep going, baby.
- Keep going. Keep going.

21:43.102 --> 21:45.469
<i>- Keep that pace. You got it.</i>

21:45.471 --> 21:48.172
<i>- And remember,
this guy weighs 200 pounds.</i>

21:48.174 --> 21:50.174
<i>Not easy to carry
that weight for this long.</i>

21:50.176 --> 21:52.476
<i>- He's in a good position
right now.</i>

21:52.478 --> 21:54.211
<i>He's in good position.</i>

21:54.213 --> 21:58.549
<i>- Oh, but you can see that
wheel wants to roll backwards.</i>

21:58.551 --> 22:01.652
<i>- Oh!
- Fighting for the dismount.</i>

22:01.654 --> 22:05.556
<i>- Come on. Get it. Nice.
- Got it!</i>

22:05.558 --> 22:07.058
- Whoo!

22:07.060 --> 22:08.659
- Tell them what you got
in your veins, baby.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.061
- There's a smile.

22:10.063 --> 22:11.696
Oh, and the flex!

22:11.698 --> 22:14.932
Beat that wall. Beat
that wall. Beat that wall.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.268
- Takes a big breath
for the Warped Wall.

22:19.739 --> 22:23.107
- And he's got it!
- I love this guy.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.710
I love this guy!

22:27.080 --> 22:28.713
- But now the back half,

22:28.715 --> 22:31.082
<i>and this is gonna be a
challenge with that big body.</i>

22:31.084 --> 22:32.416
- This is you, man.
- This is you.

22:32.418 --> 22:33.918
<i>- Remember, he's a rookie.</i>

22:33.920 --> 22:36.454
<i>Never faced the Salmon Ladder
in competition.</i>

22:36.456 --> 22:38.856
<i>Come on. You got this.</i>

22:38.858 --> 22:40.558
<i>- And this is where we see
the effects</i>

22:40.560 --> 22:42.193
<i>of the Rolling Thunder,</i>

22:42.195 --> 22:43.994
<i>deep into this course.</i>

22:43.996 --> 22:45.062
<i>- Yeah.
- He's straightening out.</i>

22:45.064 --> 22:46.230
<i>I don't like that.</i>

22:46.232 --> 22:47.531
<i>You want to keep that form.</i>

22:47.533 --> 22:49.033
<i>Nice. Okay.</i>

22:49.035 --> 22:50.568
<i>- Oh, he looks comfortable.
- Good power.</i>

22:50.570 --> 22:53.771
<i>- He looks comfortable.
- He looks real comfortable!</i>

22:53.773 --> 22:56.607
<i>One more rung.</i>

22:56.609 --> 22:57.808
<i>- Nice.
- Got it!</i>

22:57.810 --> 22:59.143
<i>- All right.</i>

22:59.145 --> 23:00.778
<i>- Now moves on
to the Giant Cubes,</i>

23:00.780 --> 23:02.380
<i>but what does he have left?</i>

23:02.382 --> 23:05.182
- Shake it out. Shake it out.

23:05.184 --> 23:06.784
<i>- Matt, it's gonna take them
a while</i>

23:06.786 --> 23:09.820
<i>to figure out how
to attack these cubes.</i>

23:09.822 --> 23:11.188
<i>- Well, those red handholds,</i>

23:11.190 --> 23:13.090
<i>only a couple of inches wide.</i>

23:13.092 --> 23:15.159
<i>Ideally, you want to work
your way up to the top</i>

23:15.161 --> 23:19.263
<i>and use the ledge, but that's
easier said than done.</i>

23:19.265 --> 23:21.399
<i>200 pounds.</i>

23:21.401 --> 23:23.000
<i>- I can feel it.</i>

23:23.002 --> 23:24.769
<i>- Can he get up?</i>

23:24.771 --> 23:26.537
<i>- Oh!
- Feet are down.</i>

23:26.539 --> 23:28.005
<i>- Save your life right now.</i>

23:28.007 --> 23:29.473
<i>- It's gonna take
a superhuman effort</i>

23:29.475 --> 23:31.208
<i>to get that foot back up!</i>

23:31.210 --> 23:32.676
<i>I don't know how he did that.</i>

23:32.678 --> 23:34.378
<i>- 40 seconds he's been
on this thing now.</i>

23:34.380 --> 23:37.948
<i>Come on, now.
Don't look back; look up!</i>

23:37.950 --> 23:40.418
<i>- No!
- No!</i>

23:40.420 --> 23:42.920
<i>Splashes down, and
we'll have to wait and see</i>

23:42.922 --> 23:45.523
<i>if that's good enough
to stay in the top 15.</i>

23:45.525 --> 23:47.958
<i>He lost his grip and his
glasses.</i>

23:47.960 --> 23:49.827
<i>Now he's got 'em.</i>

23:49.829 --> 23:52.329
<i>- Michael Johnson made it
interesting.</i>

23:52.331 --> 23:55.032
<i>Had some crazy swings
on the Wingnuts</i>

23:55.034 --> 23:57.868
<i>and made a big jump right
at the Broken Bridge,</i>

23:57.870 --> 24:01.872
<i>before falling on
the first cube.</i>

24:01.874 --> 24:03.507
- I know what I got
to do next year.

24:03.509 --> 24:05.709
I'm hanging 24/7.

24:05.711 --> 24:07.711
Whoo!

24:07.713 --> 24:09.814
<i>- Coming up, Emily Durham's</i>

24:09.816 --> 24:12.383
<i>already a superstar
in one sport.</i>

24:12.385 --> 24:16.821
<i>Now this mom's ready to take
the next step as a ninja.</i>

24:16.823 --> 24:18.189
- I'm walking into something
totally different,

24:18.191 --> 24:19.657
and it's so fun.

24:19.659 --> 24:22.927
<i>- Plus, JJ Woods' inspiration
for this season</i>

24:22.929 --> 24:25.429
<i>comes from an unlikely source.</i>

24:25.431 --> 24:26.897
- That's the sharp one, right?

24:26.899 --> 24:28.332
<i>She knows it hurts,</i>

24:28.334 --> 24:30.201
<i>but she still has
a smile on her face.</i>

24:30.203 --> 24:31.535
<i>- That story's coming up</i>

24:31.537 --> 24:34.538
<i>when "American Ninja Warrior"
returns.</i>

24:37.642 --> 24:39.076
<i>- Welcome back to
the city finals</i>

24:39.078 --> 24:40.511
<i>in Daytona Beach, Florida.</i>

24:40.513 --> 24:43.747
<i>Our coverage is brought to you
in part by SB Nation.</i>

24:43.749 --> 24:45.216
<i>For everything you need
to know</i>

24:45.218 --> 24:46.851
<i>about "American Ninja
Warrior,"</i>

24:46.853 --> 24:48.586
<i>go to ANWNation.com.</i>

24:48.588 --> 24:50.321
<i>Up next</i>

24:50.323 --> 24:53.357
<i>is one of the best water
sports athletes in history.</i>

24:53.359 --> 24:54.792
<i>This is Emily Durham,</i>

24:54.794 --> 24:57.895
<i>a four-time world champion
in wakeboarding.</i>

24:57.897 --> 25:00.698
<i>She's also a wife and
a mom to two kids,</i>

25:00.700 --> 25:03.434
<i>and they're one of the reasons
she's out here competing.</i>

25:07.240 --> 25:10.074
- I was a professional
wakeboarder for 16 years,

25:10.076 --> 25:12.977
<i>and walked away with the
biggest titles in the world,</i>

25:12.979 --> 25:14.979
<i>from world champion,
X Games champion.</i>

25:14.981 --> 25:17.081
<i>I got to the point where I
was just satisfied,</i>

25:17.083 --> 25:18.616
<i>and I was like,
"You know what?</i>

25:18.618 --> 25:20.150
<i>I'm gonna hang it
up while I'm on top."</i>

25:20.152 --> 25:21.685
<i>And I walked away, and now</i>

25:21.687 --> 25:23.287
I'm walking into something
totally different,

25:23.289 --> 25:24.755
and it's so fun.

25:24.757 --> 25:26.657
<i>- As a wakeboarder,
a lot of body control.</i>

25:26.659 --> 25:28.325
<i>- I feel like
"American Ninja Warrior"</i>

25:28.327 --> 25:30.394
<i>is, like, something as a goal</i>

25:30.396 --> 25:32.530
<i>for myself, seeing
how strong I could get.</i>

25:32.532 --> 25:36.200
<i>- Durham, we know she has
tremendous athletic prowess.</i>

25:36.202 --> 25:39.036
<i>- I have two kids
that I absolutely adore.</i>

25:39.038 --> 25:41.005
I want to show other moms
that you can do both.

25:41.007 --> 25:43.340
<i>I mean, you can have this
awesome home life</i>

25:43.342 --> 25:44.608
<i>with your kids,</i>

25:44.610 --> 25:46.143
<i>but then you can
also go work out.</i>

25:46.145 --> 25:47.778
<i>My whole family will go in the
ninja gym</i>

25:47.780 --> 25:49.246
<i>and go play on obstacles.</i>

25:49.248 --> 25:50.614
And jump. Ah!

25:50.616 --> 25:51.916
<i>My daughter honestly tells</i>

25:51.918 --> 25:53.284
<i>every single person
we run into,</i>

25:53.286 --> 25:55.853
<i>"My mom's an
American Ninja Warrior."</i>

25:55.855 --> 25:58.322
Vegas is so close,
I can feel it.

26:00.359 --> 26:04.028
<i>- There are her kids, husband,
and her brother on the right,</i>

26:04.030 --> 26:05.229
<i>and on the left
is Shaun Murray,</i>

26:05.231 --> 26:07.498
<i>another champion wakeboarder.</i>

26:07.500 --> 26:09.199
<i>He's competed
on the show twice,</i>

26:09.201 --> 26:11.235
<i>and Emily trains
on his backyard course.</i>

26:13.573 --> 26:15.005
<i>This is Durham's third time</i>

26:15.007 --> 26:16.574
<i>competing on
"American Ninja Warrior,"</i>

26:16.576 --> 26:19.143
<i>but the first time she's
made it to the city finals.</i>

26:19.145 --> 26:21.345
<i>- And it's worth noting:
no more wildcards</i>

26:21.347 --> 26:22.947
<i>into the national finals.</i>

26:22.949 --> 26:24.648
<i>Now, they have to earn it.</i>

26:24.650 --> 26:27.751
<i>These women tonight are
competing for just two spots.</i>

26:27.753 --> 26:29.320
<i>You can feel the pressure,</i>

26:29.322 --> 26:31.455
<i>and I think she steps up
with the big lights on.</i>

26:31.457 --> 26:34.124
<i>- There's Emily's biggest fan,
her seven-year-old daughter,</i>

26:34.126 --> 26:36.827
<i>Hope, who loves Mom
being a ninja.</i>

26:36.829 --> 26:38.996
<i>Durham's 5'8",
one of the taller women.</i>

26:38.998 --> 26:42.366
<i>About to wrap those arms
around the rolling pin.</i>

26:42.368 --> 26:45.302
<i>- This mom's got muscles.
- She is fit.</i>

26:45.304 --> 26:48.205
<i>- Look at her. Hold on. Oh!
- No!</i>

26:48.207 --> 26:49.640
<i>- Ooh, wow. Elbows.
- Hard impact, and stays safe.</i>

26:49.642 --> 26:50.975
<i>- Did you see the way
she got up?</i>

26:50.977 --> 26:52.042
<i>She got up like a G.</i>

26:52.044 --> 26:53.711
<i>- Well, this is the obstacle</i>

26:53.713 --> 26:55.279
<i>that took her out
of qualifying:</i>

26:55.281 --> 26:56.880
<i>the Wingnuts.</i>

26:56.882 --> 26:58.182
<i>- The thing about
professional athletes:</i>

26:58.184 --> 26:59.683
<i>they have the mentality.</i>

26:59.685 --> 27:01.418
<i>I don't see this thing
getting her again.</i>

27:01.420 --> 27:03.354
<i>- She's really stepped up her
ninja training this year,</i>

27:03.356 --> 27:06.557
<i>going to local competitions
around the country.</i>

27:06.559 --> 27:10.961
<i>- She's got a swing
going here.</i>

27:10.963 --> 27:12.429
<i>- And what a catch,</i>

27:12.431 --> 27:15.499
<i>hanging on one side,
but she saves it.</i>

27:15.501 --> 27:17.901
<i>- Hey, look, when stuff
gets tough, stay calm,</i>

27:17.903 --> 27:22.106
<i>and she is.</i>

27:22.108 --> 27:23.807
<i>Yes. Yes!</i>

27:23.809 --> 27:25.776
<i>- Another great save.
- All that wakeboarding,</i>

27:25.778 --> 27:28.212
<i>she understands what to do
with her body in space.</i>

27:28.214 --> 27:30.614
<i>Looking for the dismount.</i>

27:30.616 --> 27:32.316
<i>And she's through.</i>

27:32.318 --> 27:35.085
<i>And her daughter is excited
about what Mommy's doing.</i>

27:35.087 --> 27:37.221
<i>I love the improvement
out of Durham.</i>

27:37.223 --> 27:39.256
<i>- That's a professional
athlete right there.</i>

27:39.258 --> 27:40.858
<i>You know who that is?</i>

27:40.860 --> 27:43.961
- Come on, Emily.
<i>- Now for the Broken Bridge.</i>

27:43.963 --> 27:45.496
<i>- You float on water.</i>

27:45.498 --> 27:47.431
<i>You can float here
on the Broken Bridge.</i>

27:47.433 --> 27:49.533
<i>- Right through.
- Yeah.</i>

27:49.535 --> 27:52.236
<i>- Great balance out of Durham.
- Man, I love this.</i>

27:52.238 --> 27:53.804
<i>I love this.
Come on, Emily.</i>

27:53.806 --> 27:56.807
<i>- Now facing the fifth
obstacle, Rolling Thunder.</i>

27:56.809 --> 27:59.043
<i>Keep in mind, we've never
had a mom</i>

27:59.045 --> 28:01.011
<i>make it up the Warped Wall.</i>

28:01.013 --> 28:03.414
<i>Durham now
just one obstacle away.</i>

28:03.416 --> 28:05.349
<i>- There's a confidence
I'm seeing in her, Matt.</i>

28:05.351 --> 28:06.817
<i>There's a confidence.</i>

28:06.819 --> 28:08.786
<i>We've got some stars
developing here tonight.</i>

28:08.788 --> 28:10.554
<i>- Well, this is the best
performance Durham's</i>

28:10.556 --> 28:11.989
<i>had in
"American Ninja Warrior"...</i>

28:11.991 --> 28:13.590
<i>- Yeah, girl!
- And look at that,</i>

28:13.592 --> 28:16.360
<i>keeping the body tight,
another long reach.</i>

28:19.965 --> 28:23.467
<i>Well, no woman has bested
the Rolling Thunder this year.</i>

28:23.469 --> 28:28.539
<i>Last year, it took "Flex"
Labreck to get through it.</i>

28:28.541 --> 28:31.675
<i>The arms extending.
She may be in trouble here.</i>

28:31.677 --> 28:33.944
<i>Oh, a tremendous second wind!</i>

28:33.946 --> 28:35.646
<i>- 30 seconds on here already.</i>

28:35.648 --> 28:37.581
<i>You got to get out of there,
Emily.</i>

28:37.583 --> 28:39.817
<i>- Down on that final leg.</i>

28:39.819 --> 28:43.253
<i>- Come on.</i>

28:43.255 --> 28:44.555
<i>You got to be smooth.</i>

28:44.557 --> 28:45.856
<i>- Maybe looking
for the dismount,</i>

28:45.858 --> 28:47.458
<i>and this is where
it's trouble.</i>

28:47.460 --> 28:50.861
<i>That Plexiglas making
the next spoke a long reach.</i>

28:50.863 --> 28:52.296
<i>She's got it.</i>

28:52.298 --> 28:53.430
<i>- Oh, she's starting
to show some teeth.</i>

28:53.432 --> 28:54.965
<i>She's showing some teeth.</i>

28:54.967 --> 28:56.967
<i>She's a fighter.
She understands what it takes.</i>

28:56.969 --> 29:00.337
<i>- What does she have left?
- No!</i>

29:00.339 --> 29:03.907
<i>A strong run by Emily Durham.</i>

29:03.909 --> 29:05.843
<i>We'll have to wait and see
if it's good enough</i>

29:05.845 --> 29:09.413
<i>to move her on
to the national finals.</i>

29:09.415 --> 29:10.848
<i>- I tell you, she made</i>

29:10.850 --> 29:12.950
<i>a couple of great catches
on the Wingnuts,</i>

29:12.952 --> 29:15.919
<i>and then battled to the end
of Rolling Thunder</i>

29:15.921 --> 29:17.488
<i>before the arms gave out,</i>

29:17.490 --> 29:21.625
<i>but she still put a smile
on her daughter's face.</i>

29:21.627 --> 29:23.427
- I made it so much father
than qualifying,

29:23.429 --> 29:26.497
so I'm proud of myself.

29:26.499 --> 29:29.867
I'm excited, so...

29:29.869 --> 29:32.402
<i>- Still a lot of big names
to come tonight,</i>

29:32.404 --> 29:34.071
<i>including JJ Woods.</i>

29:34.073 --> 29:38.008
<i>He's trying to stay loose.
We'll see him in a bit.</i>

29:38.010 --> 29:40.577
<i>In early runs, the Salmon
Ladder's been a factor,</i>

29:40.579 --> 29:43.046
<i>taking out architect
Oscar Ramirez.</i>

29:43.048 --> 29:45.015
<i>- No!</i>

29:45.017 --> 29:47.584
<i>- And Orlando's Faris Xero.</i>

29:47.586 --> 29:49.353
<i>- Ooh, he doesn't have it.
- He doesn't have it.</i>

29:49.355 --> 29:51.221
<i>- But horse trainer
Adriane Alvord</i>

29:51.223 --> 29:52.890
<i>didn't get that far,</i>

29:52.892 --> 29:55.225
<i>and she washed out
on the rolling pin.</i>

29:55.227 --> 29:57.294
<i>- Oh, no, no!
- Yo, Adriane!</i>

29:57.296 --> 30:00.631
<i>- But there's more to come
on "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

30:05.370 --> 30:06.937
<i>- Welcome back to
"American Ninja Warrior"</i>

30:06.939 --> 30:08.872
<i>in Daytona Beach, Florida.</i>

30:08.874 --> 30:10.808
<i>While we were away,
two more athletes tried</i>

30:10.810 --> 30:13.811
<i>to run their way into
the national finals.</i>

30:13.813 --> 30:16.914
<i>Connecticut's Nick Patel
was one of seven walk-ons</i>

30:16.916 --> 30:19.850
<i>from qualifying to make it
to this city finals round.</i>

30:19.852 --> 30:22.553
<i>- Oh, boy. He flipped right
into it. He was up.</i>

30:22.555 --> 30:25.022
<i>- The massage therapist
nicknamed "Nicky Thumbs"</i>

30:25.024 --> 30:27.024
<i>made it all the way
to the Giant Cubes</i>

30:27.026 --> 30:28.926
<i>before losing his grip.</i>

30:28.928 --> 30:32.062
<i>- Yeah, thumbs down!</i>

30:32.064 --> 30:35.098
<i>- Alexio Gomes, oldest
of the two Brazi Bros,</i>

30:35.100 --> 30:38.001
<i>finally figured out a way
to get around the first cube.</i>

30:38.003 --> 30:39.770
<i>- Look at that.
- Nice.</i>

30:39.772 --> 30:42.239
<i>And he became the first
to attempt the leap</i>

30:42.241 --> 30:45.008
<i>to the second cube,
though it didn't end well.</i>

30:45.010 --> 30:46.543
<i>- Oh!
- Ooh! Ooh!</i>

30:46.545 --> 30:48.178
<i>- Oh! He bricked.</i>

30:48.180 --> 30:52.049
<i>My goodness, he face-planted
into that second cube.</i>

30:54.220 --> 30:55.586
<i>- Well, get ready for one of</i>

30:55.588 --> 30:57.621
<i>the craziest characters
of the night.</i>

30:57.623 --> 30:59.823
<i>This is North Carolina
construction</i>

30:59.825 --> 31:01.425
<i>worker Rigel Henry.</i>

31:01.427 --> 31:03.060
- Yeah!

31:03.062 --> 31:05.229
<i>- Yes, he has his own
scream,</i>

31:05.231 --> 31:06.630
<i>and with that wild hair,</i>

31:06.632 --> 31:08.065
<i>he looks like
Sean Penn's character</i>

31:08.067 --> 31:09.833
<i>from "Fast Times at
Ridgemont High."</i>

31:09.835 --> 31:13.537
<i>This dude is
definitely one of a kind.</i>

31:13.539 --> 31:17.374
<i>- People say I totally look
like Spicoli.</i>

31:17.376 --> 31:19.776
Hey, bud. Let's ninja.

31:19.778 --> 31:22.512
You can't judge
a book by its cover.

31:22.514 --> 31:24.314
Whoo!

31:24.316 --> 31:25.916
<i>I don't drink,
don't smoke...</i>

31:25.918 --> 31:27.317
Whoo!

31:27.319 --> 31:29.586
But I will say,
I'm completely high on life.

31:29.588 --> 31:32.823
Mount Midoriyama, that's
the good stuff, all right?

31:32.825 --> 31:35.459
<i>- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
- Wow!</i>

31:35.461 --> 31:37.027
<i>- I seem like
a pretty chill guy,</i>

31:37.029 --> 31:39.429
<i>but I got a great way to get
fired up on the course.</i>

31:39.431 --> 31:41.098
Yeah!

31:41.100 --> 31:44.201
If I'm really going for it,
you know, it'll come out,

31:44.203 --> 31:45.936
"Skeeaap!"

31:45.938 --> 31:48.472
And then I'm there.

31:48.474 --> 31:49.873
Skeeaap!

31:49.875 --> 31:51.808
Whatever it is,
it's been snatched.

31:51.810 --> 31:53.143
Skeeaap!

31:53.145 --> 31:54.811
That's that battle cry.

31:54.813 --> 31:59.283
All I need is a tasty run,
a cool buzzer, and I'm fine.

31:59.285 --> 32:03.020
Skeeaap!

32:03.022 --> 32:05.555
<i>- Rigel's also got a wife
and two kids.</i>

32:05.557 --> 32:07.224
<i>They're back in
North Carolina,</i>

32:07.226 --> 32:08.625
<i>but he has a few friends</i>

32:08.627 --> 32:09.927
<i>he trains with
on the sidelines,</i>

32:09.929 --> 32:12.062
<i>including 74-year-old</i>

32:12.064 --> 32:14.831
<i>former competitor
Chuck Mammay, the Chuckster.</i>

32:18.470 --> 32:20.304
<i>- This guy came out of nowhere
in qualifying.</i>

32:20.306 --> 32:21.872
<i>He finished the course</i>

32:21.874 --> 32:23.941
<i>and looked like
a wild man doing it.</i>

32:23.943 --> 32:26.009
<i>- Well, he's a 29-year-old
rookie who just started</i>

32:26.011 --> 32:29.179
<i>ninja training this past year.</i>

32:29.181 --> 32:33.016
<i>He's quickly through
the floating steps.</i>

32:33.018 --> 32:35.185
<i>This guy works
in industrial construction.</i>

32:35.187 --> 32:36.653
<i>Has some strong arms,</i>

32:36.655 --> 32:40.257
<i>and he'll need them here
on the Rolling Pin.</i>

32:40.259 --> 32:42.626
<i>Ooh, a hard landing,</i>

32:42.628 --> 32:45.128
<i>but bounces up
to take on the Wingnuts.</i>

32:45.130 --> 32:47.497
<i>5'10", 165.</i>

32:47.499 --> 32:49.032
<i>- Got a lot of hair.</i>

32:49.034 --> 32:51.401
<i>Just gotta hope that hair
doesn't get in his way.</i>

32:51.403 --> 32:54.037
<i>He's like Samson.
Gives him a lot of strength.</i>

32:54.039 --> 32:56.573
<i>And he's got nice form here,
nice technique.</i>

32:56.575 --> 32:58.842
<i>- And makes
the first transition.</i>

32:58.844 --> 33:00.444
<i>Has a good pace so far.</i>

33:00.446 --> 33:03.180
<i>Remember, time is often
a factor in the city finals.</i>

33:03.182 --> 33:05.382
<i>You want to go
the farthest the fastest.</i>

33:05.384 --> 33:07.884
<i>- Nice.
- Right now, it looks like</i>

33:07.886 --> 33:10.053
<i>he'll at least have to get
to the Giant Cubes</i>

33:10.055 --> 33:11.822
<i>to stay in the top 15.</i>

33:11.824 --> 33:12.823
<i>And he's through.</i>

33:12.825 --> 33:15.859
- Whoo!

33:15.861 --> 33:17.794
<i>- He's having a lot of fun
out here, Matt,</i>

33:17.796 --> 33:21.665
<i>but I love how calm he is.
He doesn't look spooked.</i>

33:21.667 --> 33:23.166
<i>- He breezes through
the Broken Bridge.</i>

33:24.903 --> 33:27.337
<i>We talk about fast times.</i>

33:27.339 --> 33:28.939
<i>Rigel's only 1 minute 20 in,</i>

33:28.941 --> 33:31.274
<i>and he's already taking on
Rolling Thunder.</i>

33:31.276 --> 33:33.677
<i>- All right, Rigel.</i>

33:33.679 --> 33:35.712
<i>- Had to really fight
through this in qualifying.</i>

33:35.714 --> 33:37.547
<i>Getting a good pace here.</i>

33:37.549 --> 33:41.018
<i>- Look at Rigel, all that
hair, just hanging loose,</i>

33:41.020 --> 33:43.253
<i>going side to side,</i>

33:43.255 --> 33:46.790
<i>moving the Rolling Thunder
round and round.</i>

33:46.792 --> 33:49.593
<i>- Mr. Hand would be
impressed by this run.</i>

33:49.595 --> 33:50.727
<i>Rigel's wife is watching
at home</i>

33:50.729 --> 33:52.262
<i>with their two young kids,</i>

33:52.264 --> 33:55.265
<i>but she said she'll come
to Vegas if he qualifies.</i>

33:55.267 --> 33:56.733
<i>Looking for the dismount.</i>

33:56.735 --> 33:58.568
<i>- He doesn't look fazed
at all, does he?</i>

33:58.570 --> 34:00.070
<i>I haven't seen him grimace,
not once.</i>

34:00.072 --> 34:01.838
<i>He's Mr. Cool.</i>

34:01.840 --> 34:04.975
<i>- Gets through, and now
facing the Warped Wall.</i>

34:04.977 --> 34:08.145
<i>And a blazing pace
to this point.</i>

34:08.147 --> 34:11.748
- I see you, Rigel!
- I see you, baby.

34:11.750 --> 34:14.351
- Just a rookie trying to get

34:14.353 --> 34:16.219
to the back half
of the course.

34:16.221 --> 34:19.188
Right up the Warped Wall,
Rigel.

34:19.190 --> 34:22.059
I don't think he's done, Akbar.

34:22.061 --> 34:24.860
His time to this point
is the fastest so far,

34:24.862 --> 34:26.063
<i>and we're still waiting
for the first</i>

34:26.065 --> 34:28.732
<i>to get past the Giant Cubes.</i>

34:28.734 --> 34:30.300
- Come on, Rigel!

34:30.302 --> 34:32.436
<i>- What's he gonna do here
on the Salmon Ladder?</i>

34:32.438 --> 34:35.505
<i>He's a rookie. Never faced
this obstacle in competition.</i>

34:35.507 --> 34:37.274
<i>- Well, first off,
he's being smart,</i>

34:37.275 --> 34:39.141
<i>trying to slow his swing</i>

34:39.143 --> 34:41.545
<i>and calm the body
before he starts up.</i>

34:41.547 --> 34:43.679
<i>Nice. Whoo!</i>

34:43.681 --> 34:45.348
<i>- Great acceleration.</i>

34:45.350 --> 34:46.716
<i>And he's through
the Salmon Ladder</i>

34:46.717 --> 34:50.320
<i>and moving down to the Cubes.</i>

34:50.322 --> 34:51.955
<i>- Matt, look at that.</i>

34:51.956 --> 34:55.192
<i>He puts his feet up right away
to take the weight off.</i>

34:55.194 --> 34:56.592
<i>Another smart move.</i>

34:56.594 --> 34:59.029
<i>- Well, these ninjas
figure things out.</i>

34:59.031 --> 35:00.564
<i>We've seen a few others
try this,</i>

35:00.566 --> 35:02.466
<i>and he's taking
a different approach.</i>

35:02.468 --> 35:04.267
<i>Has his hand on the top.</i>

35:04.269 --> 35:06.203
<i>- Strength matters,
and reach matters here</i>

35:06.205 --> 35:08.171
<i>on the Giant Cubes.</i>

35:08.173 --> 35:09.940
<i>Look, he's standing up
real tall.</i>

35:09.942 --> 35:13.443
<i>- The first to do that, and
the Chuckster likes it.</i>

35:16.849 --> 35:18.415
<i>And now that he's on top,</i>

35:18.417 --> 35:22.119
<i>he can use his fingers
to move around the sides.</i>

35:22.121 --> 35:25.655
<i>No one's been able to get
to the second cube thus far.</i>

35:25.657 --> 35:28.525
<i>- Turn now, 180 turn.</i>

35:28.527 --> 35:29.926
<i>Ooh!</i>

35:29.928 --> 35:31.695
<i>- The first to make
the transition!</i>

35:31.697 --> 35:36.399
<i>- Oh!
- Unreal Rigel Henry</i>

35:36.401 --> 35:38.635
<i>showing these ninjas
how it's done.</i>

35:38.637 --> 35:40.837
<i>- Oh, he is clean right now.
- Clean.</i>

35:40.839 --> 35:44.141
<i>- Can a rookie be the first to
complete this new obstacle?</i>

35:44.143 --> 35:45.575
<i>- Hold on.
- What is he doing?</i>

35:45.577 --> 35:47.310
<i>He should move around
to the other side.</i>

35:47.312 --> 35:48.545
<i>- He's going for the dismount!</i>

35:48.547 --> 35:51.882
<i>- Oh!
- No!</i>

35:51.884 --> 35:52.883
No!

35:52.885 --> 35:54.384
Dang!

35:54.386 --> 35:57.554
<i>- Well, a great run,
but a strange ending.</i>

35:57.556 --> 36:00.624
<i>Rigel Henry comes up short
on the Giant Cubes.</i>

36:00.626 --> 36:03.727
<i>- Man, he's the first to make
that five-foot jump</i>

36:03.729 --> 36:06.196
<i>to the second cube,
and he looked home free,</i>

36:06.198 --> 36:10.033
<i>but instead of working his way
around the side of the cube,</i>

36:10.035 --> 36:11.968
<i>he goes for an early dismount,</i>

36:11.970 --> 36:15.405
<i>but doesn't get enough swing,
and comes up short.</i>

36:15.407 --> 36:17.541
- He's standing by
with Kristine Leahy.

36:17.543 --> 36:20.010
- Rigel, amazing run on
the Giant Cubes.

36:20.012 --> 36:21.411
You were able to do
something tonight that

36:21.413 --> 36:23.013
so many others were not.

36:23.015 --> 36:24.481
How did you do it?

36:24.483 --> 36:28.051
- You know, I got the whole
lunar rays going on.

36:28.053 --> 36:29.986
You know, the crowd going on.

36:29.988 --> 36:33.924
You know, it was... I was
feeling it, you know, for sure.

36:33.926 --> 36:36.526
<i>- Why did you decided
to attempt the dismount</i>

36:36.528 --> 36:37.627
from that side of the cube?

36:37.629 --> 36:39.462
- Well, honestly,

36:39.464 --> 36:41.665
I was starting to burn out,
and, you know,

36:41.667 --> 36:43.066
I thought maybe I'd
shake things up a little bit.

36:43.068 --> 36:45.001
<i>- Well, you had a fast time
to that point.</i>

36:45.003 --> 36:46.937
<i>There's a good chance you're
gonna be going to Vegas.</i>

36:46.939 --> 36:49.272
Can I get your battle cry?

36:49.274 --> 36:51.942
- Skeeaap!

36:51.944 --> 36:53.610
- Matt and Akbar,
back to you.

36:53.612 --> 36:55.512
- Whoo!

36:55.514 --> 36:57.581
<i>- Well, he went farther
than anyone</i>

36:57.583 --> 36:59.249
<i>in the competition last year.</i>

36:59.251 --> 37:02.319
<i>Everyone's gonna be watching
when Drew Drechsel</i>

37:02.321 --> 37:03.520
<i>runs later tonight.</i>

37:03.522 --> 37:06.456
<i>Plus, her history making runs</i>

37:06.458 --> 37:09.025
<i>have inspired
a generation of young fans.</i>

37:09.027 --> 37:11.695
<i>- I want to be a ninja
just like you.</i>

37:11.697 --> 37:13.663
<i>Thank you for being
my role model.</i>

37:13.665 --> 37:16.132
<i>- So just how far can
Jessie Graff go tonight?</i>

37:16.134 --> 37:19.369
- I can't wait to face
this city finals course.

37:19.371 --> 37:22.072
<i>- When "American Ninja
Warrior" returns.</i>

37:25.876 --> 37:27.577
<i>- Welcome back to
"American Ninja Warrior"</i>

37:27.579 --> 37:29.613
<i>at the Daytona city finals.</i>

37:29.615 --> 37:31.615
<i>We're about halfway
through the night,</i>

37:31.617 --> 37:33.650
and Akbar, there's a big
roadblock in the speedway.

37:33.652 --> 37:36.486
- Yeah, that's right, Matt.
- It's the Giant Cubes.

37:36.488 --> 37:37.921
They're more like
Rubik's Cubes,

37:37.923 --> 37:40.924
because our ninjas
can't figure them out.

37:40.926 --> 37:44.127
<i>Minutes ago, we saw rookie
Dustin Fishman</i>

37:44.129 --> 37:45.996
<i>make it to that first cube,</i>

37:45.998 --> 37:48.031
<i>but then, the arms gave out.</i>

37:48.033 --> 37:49.733
<i>Ooh!</i>

37:49.735 --> 37:51.768
<i>- Then, Miami line cook
Royall Eason</i>

37:51.770 --> 37:54.904
<i>battled for almost a minute</i>

37:54.906 --> 37:57.173
<i>until he too ran out of gas.</i>

37:57.175 --> 37:58.508
<i>- He's losing real estate.
- Cannonball.</i>

37:58.510 --> 38:00.644
<i>- Oh, splashes down.</i>

38:00.646 --> 38:03.346
<i>Six-time ninja veteran
Reko Rivera</i>

38:03.348 --> 38:06.783
<i>was able to solve the
first cube. Look at that.</i>

38:06.785 --> 38:08.818
<i>- Nice!
- But the costumed competitor</i>

38:08.820 --> 38:10.754
<i>had nothing left
for the second.</i>

38:10.756 --> 38:12.389
<i>Whoa!</i>

38:12.391 --> 38:15.925
<i>- With so many falls here,
the top 15 may come down</i>

38:15.927 --> 38:20.297
<i>to who gets to this
obstacle the fastest.</i>

38:20.299 --> 38:23.166
<i>Our next competitor
is a ninja super fan</i>

38:23.168 --> 38:24.868
<i>who is living the dream.</i>

38:24.870 --> 38:27.570
<i>This is 21-year-old
Kevin Carbone.</i>

38:27.572 --> 38:30.173
<i>Not only did he finish
the course in qualifying,</i>

38:30.175 --> 38:32.108
<i>earning his spot
here in the city finals;</i>

38:32.110 --> 38:35.745
<i>he also entered our obstacle
design challenge last season.</i>

38:35.747 --> 38:38.315
<i>He sent in an idea,
and it was selected,</i>

38:38.317 --> 38:41.918
<i>and it's on the course
here in Daytona.</i>

38:41.920 --> 38:45.422
<i>- The Wingnuts! There's very
little to grab on to.</i>

38:45.424 --> 38:48.058
<i>Oh! No!</i>

38:48.060 --> 38:49.526
<i>- Oh!</i>

38:49.528 --> 38:51.461
- It's great and awful
at the same time

38:51.463 --> 38:54.364
watching people fall on
an obstacle that I created.

38:54.366 --> 38:55.799
<i>- Ooh. Oh!
- So close!</i>

38:55.801 --> 38:57.701
<i>- No!
- She missed it.</i>

38:57.703 --> 38:59.035
- It's almost like
"The Hunger Games,"

38:59.037 --> 39:00.503
when, you know, someone
dies, and it goes,

39:00.505 --> 39:01.905
"Pfew."

39:01.907 --> 39:02.906
<i>No!</i>

39:02.908 --> 39:05.842
- "Pfew."
<i>- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.</i>

39:05.844 --> 39:08.011
- I see the ninja ghosts
just kind of float away.

39:08.013 --> 39:11.948
<i>- Oh, no! No! No!</i>

39:11.950 --> 39:14.884
- I am so happy
that I was able to beat it.

39:14.886 --> 39:16.186
<i>- Oh, look at this.</i>

39:16.188 --> 39:20.857
<i>The maker survives
the Wingnuts.</i>

39:20.859 --> 39:22.525
<i>- Since qualifying,
I've come up</i>

39:22.527 --> 39:23.727
<i>with a bunch of new designs.</i>

39:23.729 --> 39:25.495
<i>They're really, really cool.</i>

39:25.497 --> 39:27.263
<i>One of them's called Pegasus,</i>

39:27.265 --> 39:29.733
<i>a new type of peg
salmon ladder.</i>

39:29.735 --> 39:31.368
- Pegasus.

39:31.370 --> 39:35.505
<i>- Another one of the obstacles
is called Chopsticks.</i>

39:35.507 --> 39:38.875
It's so hard, because
it's, like, all arms.

39:38.877 --> 39:42.579
<i>Your legs can only help you
if you time it right.</i>

39:42.581 --> 39:44.748
<i>A few weeks ago, I was
waiting in the walk-on line.</i>

39:44.750 --> 39:46.116
<i>I kept training.</i>

39:46.118 --> 39:47.517
<i>Now I'm out here
for the finals night,</i>

39:47.519 --> 39:48.618
<i>and I couldn't be more ready.</i>

39:51.390 --> 39:53.757
<i>- His parents are here
from Georgia.</i>

39:53.759 --> 39:56.359
<i>I think Mom's more nervous
than Kevin is.</i>

39:59.331 --> 40:01.431
<i>Well, Carbone had a memorable
run in qualifying...</i>

40:01.433 --> 40:03.733
<i>got past his own obstacle,
the Wingnuts,</i>

40:03.735 --> 40:06.669
<i>and then hit the buzzer
in his rookie debut.</i>

40:06.671 --> 40:09.706
<i>- It's a great story for him,
and the perfect ending</i>

40:09.708 --> 40:12.809
<i>would be to earn a ticket
to the national finals.</i>

40:12.811 --> 40:14.544
<i>- Gets through
the Floating Steps.</i>

40:14.546 --> 40:16.446
- Breathe, baby.
- Breathe.

40:16.448 --> 40:18.548
<i>- Only 5'8", 140 pounds.</i>

40:18.550 --> 40:22.652
<i>Got to ride out
the Rolling Pin.</i>

40:22.654 --> 40:25.855
<i>- Ooh! Came close to
falling off the course.</i>

40:25.857 --> 40:28.191
<i>- He's out here giving his
mom heart palpitations.</i>

40:28.193 --> 40:29.993
<i>- Well, she should be proud,</i>

40:29.995 --> 40:32.395
<i>because this is the obstacle
her son designed.</i>

40:32.397 --> 40:34.230
<i>It's the Wingnuts.</i>

40:34.232 --> 40:37.801
<i>- This is full circle for him.
- This is everything... one dream.</i>

40:37.803 --> 40:39.102
<i>You're on the obstacle</i>

40:39.104 --> 40:41.704
<i>that you created
and in the finals...</i>

40:41.706 --> 40:43.440
<i>- Makes the first leap.</i>

40:43.442 --> 40:45.475
<i>Remember, we're doing
the Obstacle Design Challenge</i>

40:45.477 --> 40:47.043
<i>again this year,</i>

40:47.045 --> 40:49.078
<i>so if you have an idea
just like Kevin Carbone,</i>

40:49.080 --> 40:52.282
<i>just go to ANWNation.com.</i>

40:52.284 --> 40:54.818
<i>Makes it
to the final Wingnut.</i>

40:54.820 --> 40:57.954
<i>Just needs the dismount.</i>

40:57.956 --> 41:02.325
<i>No problem for
the maker, Carbone.</i>

41:02.327 --> 41:06.362
<i>- Now, the Broken Bridge.</i>

41:06.364 --> 41:07.797
<i>- Ooh, nice speed.</i>

41:07.799 --> 41:10.133
<i>Nice speed through here
on Broken Bridge.</i>

41:10.135 --> 41:12.001
<i>I see you, Carbone.</i>

41:14.406 --> 41:18.241
<i>- And he's smiling as he jumps
up to take on Rolling Thunder.</i>

41:18.243 --> 41:20.276
- All right, breathe, baby.
- Breathe.

41:20.278 --> 41:22.312
<i>- Got through this in
qualifying,</i>

41:22.314 --> 41:23.913
<i>and he is really attacking it.</i>

41:23.915 --> 41:27.951
<i>He's going after it.</i>

41:27.953 --> 41:29.385
- You got it. You got it.

41:29.387 --> 41:31.054
<i>- You see that tank top says
"The Maker."</i>

41:31.056 --> 41:33.523
<i>He's not being blasphemous;
he made his own obstacle.</i>

41:33.525 --> 41:35.792
<i>He feels like he can make it
through this one here.</i>

41:35.794 --> 41:39.729
<i>- A good pace. Really powering
this 100-pound obstacle.</i>

41:39.731 --> 41:42.332
<i>- Yeah, he is.
- Well, I love the technique.</i>

41:42.334 --> 41:44.734
You give yourself a chance
after the Warped Wall,

41:44.736 --> 41:46.970
where you just roll through
Rolling Thunder.

41:46.972 --> 41:50.306
- Ready for the dismount.

41:50.308 --> 41:53.977
He's through,

41:53.979 --> 41:57.547
and the dream continues
for this rookie.

41:57.549 --> 42:00.016
Now he's facing
the Warped Wall.

42:00.018 --> 42:03.052
14 1/2 feet, and he's headed
to the back half.

42:03.054 --> 42:05.421
Beat that wall!
Beat that wall!

42:05.423 --> 42:08.391
- Right up it.
- Yes!

42:08.393 --> 42:10.126
Up and over. Up and over.

42:10.128 --> 42:11.127
<i>- One of the great things
about</i>

42:11.129 --> 42:12.729
<i>"American Ninja Warrior,"</i>

42:12.731 --> 42:15.465
<i>you can go from fan
to competitor in a short time</i>

42:15.467 --> 42:17.700
<i>if you've got the skills.</i>

42:17.702 --> 42:20.436
<i>This guy's 21st birthday
came just in time.</i>

42:20.438 --> 42:22.372
- I got this!

42:22.374 --> 42:23.973
<i>- Oh, he says, "I got this."</i>

42:23.975 --> 42:25.909
<i>I love the confidence.</i>

42:25.911 --> 42:28.011
You got this!
You got this! You got this!

42:28.013 --> 42:30.813
<i>- And now the crowd's
chanting, "You got this!"</i>

42:30.815 --> 42:32.782
<i>- There's a lot of love
in the crowd.</i>

42:32.784 --> 42:35.118
<i>Lot of love for you, Kev.</i>

42:35.120 --> 42:38.721
<i>- Got to get up four rungs.</i>

42:38.723 --> 42:44.460
<i>And look at this: The rookie
destroys the Salmon Ladder.</i>

42:44.462 --> 42:46.362
<i>Got to reach out
and touch it.</i>

42:46.364 --> 42:47.397
<i>- There you go.
- All right.</i>

42:47.399 --> 42:48.831
<i>- He's completed it.</i>

42:48.833 --> 42:51.901
<i>- Now he has to go into
overdrive here, Carbone.</i>

42:51.903 --> 42:54.938
<i>- And the second-fastest time
of the night to this point.</i>

42:54.940 --> 42:57.574
<i>We know he can
design obstacles,</i>

42:57.576 --> 42:59.642
<i>but can he solve this one?</i>

42:59.644 --> 43:04.581
<i>No one has done it so far.</i>

43:04.583 --> 43:08.251
<i>- What is this?
- What, is this new?</i>

43:08.253 --> 43:10.086
<i>- Using that pole
to try to get up there.</i>

43:10.088 --> 43:12.455
<i>- I like this, you
innovative rookie, you.</i>

43:12.457 --> 43:16.559
<i>- Well, the Maker thinking
outside the box of the Cube.</i>

43:16.561 --> 43:19.095
<i>- That's why he is the Maker.</i>

43:19.097 --> 43:21.631
<i>- Oh, my.
- Shaking out those forearms.</i>

43:21.633 --> 43:23.232
<i>- Oh, he's trying to take
this show to Vegas.</i>

43:23.234 --> 43:24.667
<i>- The 21-year-old...</i>

43:24.669 --> 43:26.369
<i>- Looking like a magician
over there.</i>

43:26.371 --> 43:30.206
<i>- I love it. That's showing
these vets how it's done.</i>

43:30.208 --> 43:31.774
<i>- All right, now here
it is right here now.</i>

43:31.776 --> 43:34.210
<i>If you haven't done
a lot of this... a lot of 180</i>

43:34.212 --> 43:36.279
<i>mid-air, this could be
challenging here.</i>

43:36.281 --> 43:39.115
<i>- Yeah!
- He made it.</i>

43:39.117 --> 43:40.583
<i>- I can't believe...</i>

43:40.585 --> 43:42.452
<i>- Come on; is a rookie gonna
do it here?</i>

43:42.454 --> 43:43.886
<i>A 21-year-old.</i>

43:43.888 --> 43:46.055
<i>- Oh, my goodness.
- Look at him.</i>

43:46.057 --> 43:48.558
<i>- Yes!
- Yes!</i>

43:48.560 --> 43:51.427
<i>Kevin Carbone has done it!</i>

43:51.429 --> 43:54.864
<i>The first to complete
the Giant Cubes.</i>

43:54.866 --> 43:57.133
<i>We've seen a lot this year.</i>

43:57.135 --> 43:59.135
<i>These kids have been
ninja training for years</i>

43:59.137 --> 44:01.237
<i>finally get their shot
at the course,</i>

44:01.239 --> 44:03.940
<i>and they are excelling.</i>

44:03.942 --> 44:07.010
<i>Now he'll be the first to
take on the Circuit Board,</i>

44:07.012 --> 44:08.978
<i>another tough obstacle.</i>

44:08.980 --> 44:10.980
<i>Has to move those handles in
and out</i>

44:10.982 --> 44:15.118
<i>of the slots across 24 feet.</i>

44:15.120 --> 44:17.487
<i>- And you have to
understand, your upper body</i>

44:17.489 --> 44:19.422
<i>is exhausted at this point.</i>

44:19.424 --> 44:21.324
<i>- Well, you can see how
they have</i>

44:21.326 --> 44:22.992
<i>that large ball on the top...</i>

44:22.994 --> 44:25.395
<i>Putting it out and
finding it. Look at this.</i>

44:25.397 --> 44:29.098
<i>Kevin Carbone... we saw this
obstacle for the first time</i>

44:29.100 --> 44:31.968
<i>in last year's
Indianapolis city finals,</i>

44:31.970 --> 44:35.204
<i>and now stage three
in Vegas.</i>

44:35.206 --> 44:38.141
<i>- What'd I tell you?
- And those arms are extended.</i>

44:38.143 --> 44:39.575
<i>He's getting tired.</i>

44:39.577 --> 44:41.811
<i>- These courses get
tougher every year,</i>

44:41.813 --> 44:46.149
<i>because the athletes
get better and stronger.</i>

44:46.151 --> 44:48.251
<i>Oh!</i>

44:48.253 --> 44:51.821
<i>- Well, the run comes to
an end, but Kevin Carbone,</i>

44:51.823 --> 44:55.258
<i>the rookie, has gone
farther than anyone tonight.</i>

44:55.260 --> 44:56.859
<i>It's not official yet,</i>

44:56.861 --> 44:58.594
<i>but a good chance he'll be
moving on</i>

44:58.596 --> 45:00.129
<i>to the national finals.</i>

45:00.131 --> 45:01.698
<i>- I see you, young pup!</i>

45:01.700 --> 45:04.600
<i>He's the first to make it
past both Giant Cubes.</i>

45:04.602 --> 45:06.803
<i>You know, he showed
it can be done,</i>

45:06.805 --> 45:09.906
<i>but on the Circuit Board,
he was just gassed.</i>

45:09.908 --> 45:11.641
<i>As he moved to
the second panel,</i>

45:11.643 --> 45:14.343
<i>his hands slipped
right off the handle.</i>

45:14.345 --> 45:15.912
- I mean, that was awesome.

45:15.914 --> 45:17.747
Freaking unbelievable
experience.

45:17.749 --> 45:20.216
<i>- JJ Woods is warming up</i>

45:20.218 --> 45:21.851
<i>down in the Toyota Pit Stop.</i>

45:21.853 --> 45:24.487
<i>We'll see his run
when we come back.</i>

45:24.489 --> 45:27.924
<i>Plus, would you buy
a used car from this guy?</i>

45:27.926 --> 45:30.126
- Hey, guys.
- My name's Drew Drechsel.

45:30.128 --> 45:32.095
<i>- It's a blast from the past.</i>

45:32.097 --> 45:33.896
<i>Drew Drechsel's evolution</i>

45:33.898 --> 45:36.966
<i>from car salesman
to ninja superstar.</i>

45:36.968 --> 45:39.335
- Whoo!

45:39.337 --> 45:42.004
<i>- When "American Ninja
Warrior" returns.</i>

45:46.043 --> 45:47.610
<i>- Welcome back to
"American Ninja Warrior"</i>

45:47.612 --> 45:49.746
.<i>in Daytona Beach, Florida.</i>

45:49.748 --> 45:51.347
<i>While we were away,</i>

45:51.349 --> 45:53.750
<i>two more athletes got
their shot on the course.</i>

45:53.752 --> 45:56.953
<i>Look at that.
Georgia's Ryan Stratis</i>

45:56.955 --> 46:00.423
<i>got a ceremonial backslap from
his students at the start.</i>

46:00.425 --> 46:02.091
<i>And right up the Warped Wall.</i>

46:02.093 --> 46:04.427
<i>The nine-time veteran then
cruised through the course,</i>

46:04.429 --> 46:07.430
<i>but even this ninja legend
couldn't pull off the leap</i>

46:07.432 --> 46:09.499
<i>to the second Giant Cube.</i>

46:09.501 --> 46:11.400
<i>Oh!</i>

46:11.402 --> 46:13.336
<i>- Shoot!</i>

46:13.338 --> 46:15.872
<i>- Jimmy John's delivery
driver Tyler Gillett</i>

46:15.874 --> 46:18.641
<i>delivered another strong run.</i>

46:18.643 --> 46:20.409
<i>- He's got it!</i>

46:20.411 --> 46:22.311
<i>- The impressive rookie
made it all the way</i>

46:22.313 --> 46:23.646
<i>to the Circuit Board,</i>

46:23.648 --> 46:25.882
<i>one of the best runs
of the night.</i>

46:25.884 --> 46:30.019
<i>Oh, no!</i>

46:30.021 --> 46:32.722
<i>Up next,
another ninja favorite.</i>

46:32.724 --> 46:35.992
<i>It's Miami stuntman JJ Woods.</i>

46:35.994 --> 46:38.995
<i>He's back in the city finals
after missing out last year,</i>

46:38.997 --> 46:41.030
<i>and he's getting
extra motivation</i>

46:41.032 --> 46:43.966
<i>from an eight-year-old girl.</i>

46:43.968 --> 46:45.802
- JJ, come on. I want
to show you all my flowers.

46:45.804 --> 46:47.603
- Show me.

46:47.605 --> 46:49.806
<i>This year in qualifying, I was
running for a special someone.</i>

46:49.808 --> 46:52.308
That's the sharp one, right?
That's the sharp one, right?

46:52.310 --> 46:54.043
- Yep.
- Ahh!

46:54.045 --> 46:55.812
<i>Her name is Zoey,</i>

46:55.814 --> 46:57.413
<i>and she is as close to me</i>

46:57.415 --> 47:00.449
<i>as anybody in my family,
if not closer.</i>

47:00.451 --> 47:02.919
<i>I've known Zoey's family
for years.</i>

47:02.921 --> 47:06.022
I've trained her,
her family members.

47:06.024 --> 47:08.457
You know Uncle JJ's
terrified of spiders, right?

47:08.459 --> 47:10.893
- Me too.
- Yep. They ain't coming.

47:10.895 --> 47:15.231
She was diagnosed
with stage 4 neuroblastoma.

47:15.233 --> 47:19.368
<i>She's been undergoing numerous
sessions of chemotherapy</i>

47:19.370 --> 47:23.539
<i>as well as surgery,
and she knows it hurts.</i>

47:23.541 --> 47:25.641
She knows she's in pain.
She can't help but feel it.

47:25.643 --> 47:28.044
But she still has
a smile on her face.

47:32.083 --> 47:35.484
<i>I would never think
I would look at the lineup</i>

47:35.486 --> 47:37.153
<i>of people I know</i>

47:37.155 --> 47:39.488
and say that the strongest
person I've ever met

47:39.490 --> 47:41.490
is an eight-year-old
little girl.

47:41.492 --> 47:43.726
Helmet.
Go. Ow!

47:43.728 --> 47:45.995
<i>No matter what gets thrown
her way,</i>

47:45.997 --> 47:47.396
<i>she keeps fighting it,</i>

47:47.398 --> 47:48.764
<i>and she approaches it with
confidence,</i>

47:48.766 --> 47:50.199
<i>her head held high.</i>

47:50.201 --> 47:54.971
I won't let you fall.
It's coming back to you.

47:54.973 --> 47:57.707
Doing it.
Yeah, girl.

47:57.709 --> 48:00.643
<i>This season,
every buzzer that I hit,</i>

48:00.645 --> 48:02.211
she's with me
every step of the way.

48:02.213 --> 48:03.212
- Yep.
- Bam!

48:03.214 --> 48:04.580
Oh, JJ's not falling again.

48:04.582 --> 48:06.682
- Yay.

48:06.684 --> 48:08.084
<i>- A sweet story,</i>

48:08.086 --> 48:10.219
<i>and JJ clearly inspired.</i>

48:10.221 --> 48:12.488
<i>He's already blazing
through the course.</i>

48:12.490 --> 48:15.925
<i>Looking for the dismount
on Rolling Thunder.</i>

48:15.927 --> 48:17.526
- Come on, JJ. Got it!

48:17.528 --> 48:18.694
- All right.

48:18.696 --> 48:20.296
And right in to the Warped
Wall.

48:20.298 --> 48:21.964
- Flying.

48:21.966 --> 48:23.766
- And this veteran has a sense
of urgency here.

48:23.768 --> 48:25.201
- Oh, he's sprinting.

48:25.203 --> 48:26.736
<i>- Got to get up
the Salmon Ladder, though.</i>

48:26.738 --> 48:28.437
- Let's go, JJ!

48:28.439 --> 48:31.641
<i>- And this crowd,
getting into this run.</i>

48:31.643 --> 48:34.043
<i>JJ's has his family
and friend Tiana Webberley</i>

48:34.045 --> 48:36.112
<i>down on the sideline.</i>

48:36.114 --> 48:38.314
<i>His friend, Zoey,
was too ill to make the trip,</i>

48:38.316 --> 48:40.383
<i>but you know she's watching.</i>

48:40.385 --> 48:42.385
<i>Just needs to get up
the Salmon Ladder</i>

48:42.387 --> 48:44.553
<i>to ensure a spot in Vegas.</i>

48:44.555 --> 48:46.656
<i>- Well, he is the crowd
favorite.</i>

48:46.658 --> 48:49.692
<i>You cannot underestimate
any of these obstacles,</i>

48:49.694 --> 48:53.462
<i>even if it is an iconic one
like the Salmon Ladder.</i>

48:53.464 --> 48:55.197
<i>Nice!</i>

48:55.199 --> 48:57.833
<i>- Just needs to reach over,
and there it is.</i>

48:57.835 --> 49:00.670
<i>He's guaranteed a spot
in the top 15.</i>

49:00.672 --> 49:02.905
<i>He's going to
the national finals.</i>

49:02.907 --> 49:05.541
<i>Now he's on the Giant Cubes.</i>

49:05.543 --> 49:07.343
<i>- Oh, and look.</i>

49:07.345 --> 49:10.313
<i>He's using the Kevin Carbone
technique to lift himself up.</i>

49:10.315 --> 49:12.148
<i>- I like that approach.</i>

49:12.150 --> 49:14.183
<i>You can see, it just gives him
a brief respite there.</i>

49:14.185 --> 49:16.118
<i>- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- Now, that cube, it moves.</i>

49:16.120 --> 49:17.620
<i>It's slippery.
You know how ice cubes are.</i>

49:17.622 --> 49:19.655
<i>- This obstacle is diabolical.</i>

49:19.657 --> 49:21.791
<i>- He's using his feet
to hold himself up.</i>

49:21.793 --> 49:24.860
<i>Oh, but they slide off!</i>

49:24.862 --> 49:27.730
<i>- Recovers.
- Nice!</i>

49:27.732 --> 49:30.833
<i>- Great power, great control
out of JJ Woods.</i>

49:30.835 --> 49:35.371
<i>Only two others have
made it past this obstacle.</i>

49:35.373 --> 49:36.839
<i>And he's done it.</i>

49:39.410 --> 49:42.311
<i>JJ Woods,
only two obstacles left,</i>

49:42.313 --> 49:44.947
<i>starting here
with the Circuit Board.</i>

49:44.949 --> 49:47.550
- First finisher!
- First finisher!

49:47.552 --> 49:49.418
You got that.
The first finisher!

49:49.420 --> 49:51.921
<i>- You heard it. He says JJ's
gonna be the first finisher.</i>

49:51.923 --> 49:54.090
<i>But right now, JJ has to
survive</i>

49:54.092 --> 49:55.925
<i>this Circuit Board.</i>

49:55.927 --> 49:58.427
<i>No one's made it through
this obstacle so far.</i>

49:58.429 --> 50:01.330
<i>JJ did a good job
conserving his energy.</i>

50:01.332 --> 50:02.732
<i>I think he can be the guy</i>

50:02.734 --> 50:04.200
<i>to go all the way,
but this Circuit Board,</i>

50:04.202 --> 50:06.068
<i>now, you really have
to be efficient.</i>

50:06.070 --> 50:07.269
<i>- Yeah, not only efficient;
you got to see</i>

50:07.271 --> 50:08.738
<i>where the heck you're going.</i>

50:08.740 --> 50:10.673
<i>- Oh, it's such a challenge
to be up there</i>

50:10.675 --> 50:12.708
<i>and have the precision
to hold your body up,</i>

50:12.710 --> 50:16.779
<i>especially at 175 pounds.</i>

50:16.781 --> 50:18.647
<i>He's moving quickly.</i>

50:18.649 --> 50:20.249
<i>I believe that's helping.</i>

50:20.251 --> 50:22.151
<i>Some of the other guys
had a more deliberate pace,</i>

50:22.153 --> 50:23.819
<i>and they just wore out.</i>

50:23.821 --> 50:25.788
<i>- He's staying very calm,</i>

50:25.790 --> 50:28.324
<i>even if one of those handles
slip out, like that.</i>

50:28.326 --> 50:31.894
<i>He's moving the right side
and then the left side,</i>

50:31.896 --> 50:33.496
<i>not trying to do too much.</i>

50:33.498 --> 50:36.098
<i>- Has made it
to the final panel,</i>

50:36.100 --> 50:39.402
<i>close enough to consider
a dismount.</i>

50:39.404 --> 50:40.836
<i>These are shorter slots.</i>

50:40.838 --> 50:42.538
<i>That makes it
a little more frustrating.</i>

50:42.540 --> 50:45.474
<i>Trying to lock it in,
and Woods... oh, my.</i>

50:45.476 --> 50:46.809
<i>The third board.</i>

50:46.811 --> 50:49.378
<i>- Come on.
- He's going for it.</i>

50:49.380 --> 50:51.113
<i>- He's going for the dismount.</i>

50:51.115 --> 50:53.049
<i>- Yeah!
- Got it!</i>

50:54.952 --> 50:58.154
<i>And what a feeling that
has to be for JJ Woods.</i>

50:58.156 --> 51:01.357
<i>- Matt, he is gassed.
- He is gassed.</i>

51:01.359 --> 51:04.326
<i>He put everything
into that one.</i>

51:04.328 --> 51:06.162
<i>- Now he'll be
the first tonight to take</i>

51:06.164 --> 51:07.696
<i>on this final obstacle,</i>

51:07.698 --> 51:11.333
<i>the Elevator Climb...
35 feet up to the buzzer,</i>

51:11.335 --> 51:13.669
<i>and only a few have beaten
it this year.</i>

51:16.607 --> 51:20.876
<i>- The crowd chanting his name
as he backs into the tower.</i>

51:20.878 --> 51:23.579
<i>- Come on, JJ.
- Can he be the first</i>

51:23.581 --> 51:27.049
<i>to hit the buzzer
here in Daytona?</i>

51:27.051 --> 51:28.818
<i>Last week in San Antonio,</i>

51:28.820 --> 51:32.321
<i>only the great Daniel Gil
reached the top.</i>

51:32.323 --> 51:34.457
<i>Here we go. 35 feet.</i>

51:34.459 --> 51:36.459
<i>- Come on, JJ.
- Oh, boy.</i>

51:36.461 --> 51:38.761
<i>He's climbing that 15 feet.</i>

51:38.763 --> 51:40.996
<i>He's going.
He's going.</i>

51:40.998 --> 51:44.834
- Come on, J!
- Fight. Fight.

51:44.836 --> 51:46.469
<i>- The eyes closing.</i>

51:46.471 --> 51:48.237
<i>- You start closing your eyes,
you start feeling it.</i>

51:48.239 --> 51:50.840
<i>- And the arms extended.
- Zoned out.</i>

51:50.842 --> 51:54.477
<i>- It's like he's not
even doing it.</i>

51:54.479 --> 51:58.614
<i>JJ Woods!
He looks unconscious now.</i>

51:58.616 --> 52:00.716
<i>- Come on. Oh, no.
- Oh!</i>

52:00.718 --> 52:02.985
<i>He was about ten feet away,</i>

52:02.987 --> 52:05.721
<i>but couldn't
quite reach the top.</i>

52:05.723 --> 52:08.224
<i>Has the best run of
the night so far, though,</i>

52:08.226 --> 52:11.861
<i>and little Zoey has got to
be proud of her Uncle JJ.</i>

52:11.863 --> 52:15.764
<i>He got past the tough ones.
He flew past the Giant Cubes</i>

52:15.766 --> 52:18.067
<i>and just dominated
on the Circuit Board,</i>

52:18.069 --> 52:20.002
<i>but it all took a toll,</i>

52:20.004 --> 52:22.338
<i>and as he neared the top
of the Elevator Climb,</i>

52:22.340 --> 52:24.373
<i>he just runs out of gas,</i>

52:24.375 --> 52:28.577
<i>but JJ's going back
to the national finals.</i>

52:28.579 --> 52:30.012
<i>- Coming up...
- Oh!</i>

52:30.014 --> 52:33.482
<i>- Before he became
a superstar ninja,</i>

52:33.484 --> 52:37.219
<i>Drew Drechsel was
a superstar car salesman.</i>

52:37.221 --> 52:38.754
- Just like these
used cars here,

52:38.756 --> 52:40.289
I got plenty of fight
left in me.

52:40.291 --> 52:42.458
<i>- The real-life ninja's
secret past</i>

52:42.460 --> 52:45.561
<i>when "American Ninja
Warrior" returns.</i>

52:48.565 --> 52:51.066
<i>- Welcome back to the Daytona
International Speedway.</i>

52:51.068 --> 52:54.003
<i>If you ever get to visit here,
check out the Toyota Injector,</i>

52:54.005 --> 52:55.704
<i>where you'll find vehicles,
displays,</i>

52:55.706 --> 52:57.506
<i>and activities like
the Canyon Run,</i>

52:57.508 --> 53:00.376
<i>featuring the 2017
Toyota 4Runner.</i>

53:00.378 --> 53:04.647
<i>It's a real treat for race
fans and auto enthusiasts.</i>

53:04.649 --> 53:07.349
<i>Up next, another one of our
impressive women competitors.</i>

53:07.351 --> 53:09.652
<i>This is Lindsay Eskildsen.</i>

53:09.654 --> 53:12.421
<i>She's flown across the country
from Sacramento, California,</i>

53:12.423 --> 53:14.256
<i>to compete here in Florida,</i>

53:14.258 --> 53:16.825
<i>but she's got plenty
of frequent flyer miles.</i>

53:20.298 --> 53:23.899
<i>- I was a competitive gymnast
for a total of 12 years,</i>

53:23.901 --> 53:26.468
and then I transitioned
into cheerleading.

53:26.470 --> 53:28.604
<i>I started off
with an all-star team,</i>

53:28.606 --> 53:31.707
<i>and then I also cheered
for the WNBA.</i>

53:31.709 --> 53:34.543
<i>After cheerleading
kind of came to an end,</i>

53:34.545 --> 53:37.713
I was always looking for a way
to kind of fill that void,

53:37.715 --> 53:42.017
<i>so I got really involved
in the ninja thing.</i>

53:42.019 --> 53:43.852
<i>I train in the office.
I train in the gym.</i>

53:43.854 --> 53:45.254
<i>I train at home.</i>

53:45.256 --> 53:47.089
<i>Went to different
ninja competitions</i>

53:47.091 --> 53:48.824
<i>all across the country,</i>

53:48.826 --> 53:51.427
<i>and then I went to a ninja
competition in North Carolina,</i>

53:51.429 --> 53:54.330
<i>where I met another ninja,
Joe Green,</i>

53:54.332 --> 53:56.732
<i>who was in the Atlanta
finals last year.</i>

53:56.734 --> 53:59.501
<i>- You know, I'm gonna call
him Mean Joe Green.</i>

53:59.503 --> 54:01.670
<i>- So we met on a ninja course,</i>

54:01.672 --> 54:04.440
<i>but we had to conquer
a much tougher obstacle.</i>

54:04.442 --> 54:07.076
I live in California,
and he lives in Alabama.

54:10.982 --> 54:12.781
<i>- She's a go-getter.</i>

54:12.783 --> 54:15.851
When she wants something,
she gets it.

54:15.853 --> 54:18.287
- I missed you.
- I missed you too, baby.

54:18.289 --> 54:21.357
<i>I come out to visit him
in Huntsville,</i>

54:21.359 --> 54:26.729
<i>so I fly back and forth
2,300 miles every time.</i>

54:26.731 --> 54:28.964
<i>- We have a ton of fun
together all the time.</i>

54:28.966 --> 54:31.133
<i>We're best friends.</i>

54:31.135 --> 54:32.635
<i>- It's tough,
but it's worth it.</i>

54:32.637 --> 54:34.136
<i>I love being with Joe,</i>

54:34.138 --> 54:37.172
and I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to make it work.

54:40.044 --> 54:43.445
<i>- And there's Joe, ready
to cheer her on,</i>

54:43.447 --> 54:45.347
<i>along with Lindsay's parents.</i>

54:48.986 --> 54:50.953
<i>Well, Eskildsen was serious
about her cheerleading.</i>

54:50.955 --> 54:53.689
<i>She was on the college
cheer squads at Fresno State</i>

54:53.691 --> 54:55.391
<i>and at Sacramento State.</i>

54:55.393 --> 54:57.926
<i>You have to be a very good
athlete to reach that level.</i>

54:57.928 --> 55:01.964
<i>- Just 5'2", 103 pounds,
but she's a bundle of energy.</i>

55:01.966 --> 55:03.565
<i>You better believe
she's still got</i>

55:03.567 --> 55:06.168
<i>that cheerleader spirit
in her.</i>

55:06.170 --> 55:07.903
<i>- She was impressive
in qualifying,</i>

55:07.905 --> 55:10.139
<i>made it all the way
to Rolling Thunder,</i>

55:10.141 --> 55:14.109
<i>and looking very comfortable,
very strong doing it.</i>

55:14.111 --> 55:15.511
- Grab it tight.
- Let's go.

55:15.513 --> 55:17.446
<i>- Now the Rolling Pin.</i>

55:17.448 --> 55:19.181
<i>- And at just over 100 pounds,</i>

55:19.183 --> 55:24.286
<i>this obstacle is really
gonna throw her around.</i>

55:24.288 --> 55:27.022
<i>Hard impact,
but she bounces right up.</i>

55:29.560 --> 55:30.993
<i>- Now the Wingnuts.</i>

55:30.995 --> 55:35.564
<i>Her size may be
a challenge on this.</i>

55:35.566 --> 55:38.200
<i>- 5'2", 103, but excellent
body control</i>

55:38.202 --> 55:39.935
<i>as a gymnast and
a cheerleader.</i>

55:39.937 --> 55:42.438
<i>Body control
is crucial here,</i>

55:42.440 --> 55:44.039
<i>but the landing is even more.</i>

55:44.041 --> 55:45.774
<i>- Wow. And good power.</i>

55:45.776 --> 55:47.343
<i>- Matt, you can see that</i>

55:47.345 --> 55:49.311
<i>she's really been prepping
for this opportunity.</i>

55:49.313 --> 55:51.013
<i>She's not coming around
here, playing around.</i>

55:51.015 --> 55:55.084
<i>This isn't a playground.
This is serious.</i>

55:55.086 --> 55:56.852
<i>Whoo!
There we go.</i>

55:56.854 --> 55:59.655
<i>- I'm telling you, business
is booming for Lindsay.</i>

55:59.657 --> 56:02.658
<i>She's just looking so calm,
this web developer.</i>

56:02.660 --> 56:05.527
<i>You can see, she hasn't
forgotten her athletic roots.</i>

56:05.529 --> 56:08.897
<i>- No.
- Really great power.</i>

56:08.899 --> 56:10.699
- Yeah!

56:10.701 --> 56:12.234
<i>- Well, Joe Green's loving it.</i>

56:12.236 --> 56:13.569
<i>He made it to the
Warped Wall last year.</i>

56:13.571 --> 56:15.504
<i>His girlfriend
trying to top that.</i>

56:15.506 --> 56:17.039
<i>First up, though,
the Broken Bridge.</i>

56:21.145 --> 56:23.078
<i>Gets through it, and
now facing the obstacle</i>

56:23.080 --> 56:24.346
<i>that took her out
in qualifying,</i>

56:24.348 --> 56:26.415
<i>Rolling Thunder.</i>

56:28.853 --> 56:30.886
<i>- I think she understands
what it takes.</i>

56:30.888 --> 56:31.987
<i>She's gonna have to have
better speed</i>

56:31.989 --> 56:34.823
<i>here on Rolling Thunder.</i>

56:34.825 --> 56:37.493
<i>- Ooh!
- Just barely grabbed the bar.</i>

56:37.495 --> 56:40.429
<i>Only had one hand on it,
but saves it.</i>

56:40.431 --> 56:42.564
<i>Again, she's only 5'2"
and 100 pounds,</i>

56:42.566 --> 56:46.101
<i>and moving
that 100-pound wheel... oh!</i>

56:46.103 --> 56:47.970
<i>Took a shot to the face.</i>

56:47.972 --> 56:50.773
<i>- Right in the kisser.
- Well, at this point,</i>

56:50.775 --> 56:54.276
<i>Lindsay Eskildsen is the
fastest woman to get here.</i>

56:54.278 --> 56:57.379
<i>With only Jessie Graff
remaining, Lindsay Eskildsen</i>

56:57.381 --> 56:59.415
<i>has punched her ticket
to Vegas.</i>

56:59.417 --> 57:01.016
<i>And look at this.</i>

57:01.018 --> 57:02.751
<i>This apparatus
weighs 100 pounds,</i>

57:02.753 --> 57:04.586
<i>about as much as Lindsay does.</i>

57:04.588 --> 57:06.722
<i>- She is scrappy.
- I like it, Lindsay.</i>

57:06.724 --> 57:08.457
<i>- Oh, my.</i>

57:08.459 --> 57:10.125
<i>This is where it gets tough,
though, on the Plexiglas.</i>

57:10.127 --> 57:11.827
<i>The long reach for the 5'2"
Eskildsen.</i>

57:11.829 --> 57:13.162
<i>Got it!</i>

57:13.164 --> 57:14.530
<i>- You see a turn
in her body now.</i>

57:14.532 --> 57:16.298
<i>She's looking for the exit,</i>

57:16.300 --> 57:18.667
<i>but she needs a few more
turns.</i>

57:18.669 --> 57:20.035
<i>- Long reach!</i>

57:20.037 --> 57:21.603
<i>- That extra reach she had
to go for.</i>

57:21.605 --> 57:23.505
<i>- Oh, my. I don't know
how she's doing it.</i>

57:23.507 --> 57:25.574
<i>- 45 seconds, Matt.
- When you start flirting around</i>

57:25.576 --> 57:28.410
<i>with a minute on this thing...</i>

57:28.412 --> 57:31.547
<i>- And still moving it!
- Man, Rolling Thunder,</i>

57:31.549 --> 57:33.182
<i>that's a good record,
if you only...</i>

57:33.184 --> 57:35.117
<i>- No!</i>

57:35.119 --> 57:36.952
<i>Splashes down!</i>

57:36.954 --> 57:40.722
<i>I thought she was gonna do it,
but still a good enough run</i>

57:40.724 --> 57:44.026
<i>and to guarantee her a spot
in the national finals.</i>

57:44.028 --> 57:47.162
<i>- Watch this.
- She was barely able to jump up</i>

57:47.164 --> 57:49.865
<i>to reach the bar and start
Rolling Thunder.</i>

57:49.867 --> 57:53.235
<i>Then she took a shot
to the face, so it's no wonder</i>

57:53.237 --> 57:54.970
<i>she was exhausted at the end,</i>

57:54.972 --> 57:57.339
<i>and her hands
just peeled right off.</i>

57:57.341 --> 57:58.507
<i>- She's down with Kristine</i>

57:58.509 --> 58:00.609
<i>for the
POM post-run interview.</i>

58:00.611 --> 58:04.279
- Lindsay, what an incredible
run... so incredible

58:04.281 --> 58:06.849
that we actually want you
to look up at the Jumbotron,

58:06.851 --> 58:09.551
and we're gonna replay
some highlights here.

58:09.553 --> 58:10.786
This is on the Rolling Pin.

58:10.788 --> 58:12.354
Can you walk me
through what's happening

58:12.356 --> 58:13.822
as it hits you
right in the face?

58:13.824 --> 58:16.091
- Oh, that was... I didn't
even know

58:16.093 --> 58:17.826
I got hit in the face
right there.

58:17.828 --> 58:21.964
I mean, honestly, I didn't have
as tight of a grab as I wanted,

58:21.966 --> 58:23.699
so I really grabbed on tight,

58:23.701 --> 58:25.400
and then my chin kind of
was in the wrong spot, so...

58:25.402 --> 58:27.035
- And here's
the Rolling Thunder.

58:27.037 --> 58:30.272
Watch is it hits you
right in the face again.

58:30.274 --> 58:31.673
Did you know it happened there?

58:31.675 --> 58:33.742
- That one I really felt.

58:33.744 --> 58:35.177
It really... it kind
of rocked me.

58:35.179 --> 58:38.280
Oh, my gosh! That's even
worse than I thought.

58:38.282 --> 58:41.750
- Well, Lindsay, the great
news is, it was all worth it,

58:41.752 --> 58:43.352
because I can officially
tell you

58:43.354 --> 58:46.321
that you've qualified
to go Las Vegas.

58:46.323 --> 58:48.657
Congratulations.

58:48.659 --> 58:50.826
Matt,
we'll send it back to you.

58:50.828 --> 58:54.229
<i>- So now only one woman
left tonight,</i>

58:54.231 --> 58:56.798
<i>but it's the great
Jessie Graff.</i>

58:56.800 --> 58:58.800
<i>Her run's just minutes away.</i>

58:58.802 --> 59:01.703
<i>A couple of earlier runs
came up short.</i>

59:01.705 --> 59:04.907
<i>- Oh!
- Ooh, he is fighting for it.</i>

59:04.909 --> 59:08.343
<i>Miami Realtor Les Bradley
battled to the Salmon Ladder.</i>

59:08.345 --> 59:10.078
<i>Oh!</i>

59:10.080 --> 59:13.115
<i>- And med student Steven Cen
took a tumble</i>

59:13.117 --> 59:15.517
<i>- on the Broken Bridge.
- Boom!</i>

59:15.519 --> 59:18.720
<i>- We've got more to come
on "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

59:22.425 --> 59:24.593
<i>- Welcome back to
Daytona Beach, Florida.</i>

59:24.595 --> 59:26.128
<i>While we were away,</i>

59:26.130 --> 59:29.331
<i>two more ninjas took on
this city finals course.</i>

59:29.333 --> 59:31.934
<i>Florida's Casidy Marks
was one of the few</i>

59:31.936 --> 59:34.736
<i>to get past the Giant Cubes.</i>

59:34.738 --> 59:36.538
<i>Got it!</i>

59:36.540 --> 59:38.740
<i>And what a feeling
for Casidy Marks.</i>

59:38.742 --> 59:40.709
<i>However, the three-time
walk-on</i>

59:40.711 --> 59:42.811
<i>finally fell
at the Circuit Board.</i>

59:42.813 --> 59:45.547
<i>- No!
- But it was good enough</i>

59:45.549 --> 59:48.083
<i>to get him
into the national finals.</i>

59:48.085 --> 59:50.819
<i>Brazi Bro Lucas Gomes,
the other competitor</i>

59:50.821 --> 59:53.188
<i>from that fun-loving
Brazilian family</i>

59:53.190 --> 59:56.224
<i>was back for his second
straight city finals.</i>

59:56.226 --> 59:59.127
<i>Oh, look at that!</i>

59:59.129 --> 01:00:01.597
<i>Just like his brother, though,
the worship leader</i>

01:00:01.599 --> 01:00:03.332
<i>couldn't get past
the Giant Cubes.</i>

01:00:03.334 --> 01:00:05.701
<i>- Oh!
- What?</i>

01:00:05.703 --> 01:00:07.703
<i>- But because he had
a fast time to that point,</i>

01:00:07.705 --> 01:00:10.005
<i>he got some good news.</i>

01:00:10.007 --> 01:00:12.541
- He's officially qualified
for Las Vegas.

01:00:12.543 --> 01:00:15.110
Congratulations.

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:18.080
<i>- On the course right now,
facing the Warped Wall,</i>

01:00:18.082 --> 01:00:20.716
one of the most
popular athletes out here:

01:00:20.718 --> 01:00:24.553
Sean Darling-Hammond, a lawyer
based in Washington, D.C.

01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:30.425
- Yes!
- And right up it.

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:34.296
This guy has one
impressive résumé:

01:00:34.298 --> 01:00:36.698
<i>undergraduate degree
from Harvard,</i>

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.567
<i>law degree from Cal Berkeley,</i>

01:00:38.569 --> 01:00:40.168
<i>clerked for a federal judge.</i>

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:42.237
<i>This guy's known as
The Giving Ninja,</i>

01:00:42.239 --> 01:00:44.039
<i>because he's dedicated
his life</i>

01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:46.274
<i>to helping others.</i>

01:00:46.276 --> 01:00:47.843
<i>He and his wife,
always thinking of others.</i>

01:00:47.845 --> 01:00:49.544
<i>He said, Akbar, he
wins a million dollars,</i>

01:00:49.546 --> 01:00:50.946
<i>not taking a penny of it.</i>

01:00:50.948 --> 01:00:52.481
<i>- Yep.
- He's giving it all away,</i>

01:00:52.483 --> 01:00:54.549
<i>and that's why he has been
named The Giving Ninja.</i>

01:00:54.551 --> 01:00:56.518
<i>- Well, he'd be a step closer
to that million dollars</i>

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.587
<i>if he finishes
the Salmon Ladder.</i>

01:00:58.589 --> 01:01:00.422
<i>His time, he'll be
guaranteed a spot</i>

01:01:00.424 --> 01:01:01.623
<i>in the top 15.</i>

01:01:05.629 --> 01:01:07.229
<i>And there it is.</i>

01:01:07.231 --> 01:01:10.932
<i>Sean Darling-Hammond qualifies
for the national finals.</i>

01:01:10.934 --> 01:01:12.567
<i>His second time in the
four years</i>

01:01:12.569 --> 01:01:14.302
<i>that he's competed here.</i>

01:01:14.304 --> 01:01:15.971
<i>"Flex" Labreck among
the ninjas</i>

01:01:15.973 --> 01:01:17.873
<i>offering advice down
on the sideline.</i>

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:20.809
<i>- And that's as fast as anyone
getting up to the top.</i>

01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:23.145
<i>He's taking a different route.
He's taking his own path.</i>

01:01:23.147 --> 01:01:25.814
<i>- Well, he got up there.
- That was the difficult part.</i>

01:01:25.816 --> 01:01:29.217
<i>Using his feet to take the
pressure off his fingertips.</i>

01:01:29.219 --> 01:01:31.319
<i>That's a climbing technique.</i>

01:01:31.321 --> 01:01:34.923
<i>- Now he's got to leap over
to the other one.</i>

01:01:34.925 --> 01:01:36.792
<i>- Ooh!
- Yes.</i>

01:01:36.794 --> 01:01:38.293
<i>- Okay!</i>

01:01:38.295 --> 01:01:40.429
<i>Yeah! Oh, yeah.
He's got enough energy.</i>

01:01:40.431 --> 01:01:42.864
<i>- I love it.
- Sean Darling-Hammond.</i>

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:45.400
<i>I think, we talk about
The Giving Ninja.</i>

01:01:45.402 --> 01:01:47.302
<i>This guy's got a big heart,</i>

01:01:47.304 --> 01:01:49.037
<i>and he's showing it here
on the Giant Cubes.</i>

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:52.240
<i>- Yes.
- Look at that.</i>

01:01:52.242 --> 01:01:55.911
<i>- He wants that million
dollars to give it all away.</i>

01:01:55.913 --> 01:01:57.646
<i>- And talk about giving.</i>

01:01:57.648 --> 01:02:00.382
<i>Get this: Sean actually handed
out sandwiches and drinks</i>

01:02:00.384 --> 01:02:01.717
<i>to all the folks waiting in</i>

01:02:01.719 --> 01:02:04.519
<i>our walk-on line
for Daytona this year.</i>

01:02:04.521 --> 01:02:06.154
- Come on, babe.

01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:07.856
<i>- Now the Circuit Board,</i>

01:02:07.858 --> 01:02:09.891
<i>and how much does
he have left?</i>

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:15.263
<i>JJ Woods the only one to get
past this so far tonight.</i>

01:02:15.265 --> 01:02:17.666
<i>- He's really stretching,</i>

01:02:17.668 --> 01:02:20.268
<i>covering a lot of distance
with each move.</i>

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:22.070
<i>- And you can see just
how precise</i>

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:24.406
<i>you have to be with
those placements.</i>

01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:26.842
<i>- Mm-mm. Not that one.
- He tried the wrong slot.</i>

01:02:26.844 --> 01:02:29.077
<i>- Well, those handles
are two different sizes.</i>

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:32.881
<i>The big one won't fit in the
small slot, and vice versa.</i>

01:02:32.883 --> 01:02:34.783
<i>And look at him just keeping</i>

01:02:34.785 --> 01:02:37.519
<i>those arms looking
utterly in control.</i>

01:02:37.521 --> 01:02:39.821
<i>- Look how crazy this is.
- Oh, my.</i>

01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:41.490
<i>- Look at this.
- He's making a transfer.</i>

01:02:41.492 --> 01:02:42.991
<i>I told you with that smile</i>

01:02:42.993 --> 01:02:44.426
<i>he was gonna be able
to make it through.</i>

01:02:44.428 --> 01:02:46.695
<i>He's already on the third
Circuit Board.</i>

01:02:46.697 --> 01:02:50.332
<i>- Repositioning it.
- Come on! Unreal.</i>

01:02:50.334 --> 01:02:53.101
<i>Sean Darling-Hammond
looking utterly in control</i>

01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:55.670
<i>on this upper body.

01:02:55.672 --> 01:02:58.840
<i>- Ooh. Watch that left hand.
- Watch that left hand.</i>

01:02:58.842 --> 01:03:00.709
<i>- He's gonna go for it.
- He's going for it.</i>

01:03:00.711 --> 01:03:03.211
<i>Get out of there.
Get out of there.</i>

01:03:03.213 --> 01:03:04.546
<i>Fly! Fly! Fly!</i>

01:03:04.548 --> 01:03:06.014
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:03:06.016 --> 01:03:10.952
<i>The Giving Ninja
giving it his all.</i>

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:12.154
<i>And throwing up
that heart sign.</i>

01:03:12.156 --> 01:03:14.322
<i>That's his trademark.</i>

01:03:14.324 --> 01:03:15.891
<i>- Man, he just gave it
to the Circuit Board.</i>

01:03:15.893 --> 01:03:18.126
<i>- He's already punched
his ticket to Vegas,</i>

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:20.095
<i>but The Giving Ninja could
give</i>

01:03:20.097 --> 01:03:21.963
<i>this night a special boost</i>

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:25.634
<i>by getting to the top of this
obstacle, the Elevator Climb.</i>

01:03:25.636 --> 01:03:27.569
- Let it go.
- Let's go. Come on!

01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:29.938
<i>- No one's made it
to the top tonight.</i>

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.674
<i>We saw JJ Woods, though,
get very close.</i>

01:03:32.676 --> 01:03:34.409
<i>- This thing is 35 feet tall.</i>

01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:35.744
<i>- Well, in L.A.,</i>

01:03:35.746 --> 01:03:37.279
<i>we saw a few athletes
get up it,</i>

01:03:37.281 --> 01:03:39.414
<i>but San Antonio,
only Daniel Gil did it.</i>

01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:40.949
<i>- Right. He's got a slow
start here, Matt.</i>

01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:42.617
<i>You can tell, this is taxing.</i>

01:03:42.619 --> 01:03:45.620
<i>Punch that third floor.
Get up to the top.</i>

01:03:45.622 --> 01:03:47.823
- Come on, babe.

01:03:47.825 --> 01:03:50.225
<i>- Another 20 feet to go.</i>

01:03:50.227 --> 01:03:51.560
<i>- Come on, Sean.</i>

01:03:51.562 --> 01:03:53.461
<i>It's all shoulder joints
right there.</i>

01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:55.397
<i>Ain't no muscles
involved in that.</i>

01:03:55.399 --> 01:03:57.566
<i>- Look at this, just
going inch by inch</i>

01:03:57.568 --> 01:03:58.567
<i>at this point.</i>

01:03:58.569 --> 01:03:59.835
<i>- Just ignore the pain.</i>

01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:02.103
<i>Pain don't make no noise.
Come on.</i>

01:04:02.105 --> 01:04:03.672
<i>- Well, I love it.
- The arms are extended.</i>

01:04:03.674 --> 01:04:05.774
<i>Barely move the handles
going up,</i>

01:04:05.776 --> 01:04:07.142
<i>but he's not advancing.</i>

01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:08.577
<i>- Oh, man.
- You can see all teeth.</i>

01:04:08.579 --> 01:04:11.046
<i>- Oh!</i>

01:04:11.048 --> 01:04:12.614
<i>What a run!</i>

01:04:12.616 --> 01:04:15.183
<i>We saw Sean Darling-Hammond,
The Giving Ninja.</i>

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:17.619
<i>This man has heart.</i>

01:04:17.621 --> 01:04:19.387
<i>- Look at him
on the Circuit Board.</i>

01:04:19.389 --> 01:04:22.991
<i>He was 10 feet away, and he
just goes for the dismount.</i>

01:04:22.993 --> 01:04:26.394
<i>Barely survives, and you got
to love his reaction,</i>

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:29.931
<i>but just had nothing left
for the Elevator Climb.</i>

01:04:29.933 --> 01:04:31.633
<i>- He's standing by with
Kristine.</i>

01:04:31.635 --> 01:04:34.870
- Sean, the Elevator Climb, can
you describe to me the feeling,

01:04:34.872 --> 01:04:36.771
what it's like to be
hanging up there

01:04:36.773 --> 01:04:38.707
and trying to make it
all the way to the top?

01:04:38.709 --> 01:04:41.343
- You're pouring every drop
of effort you have left

01:04:41.345 --> 01:04:43.144
inside of you out
onto the course.

01:04:43.146 --> 01:04:45.013
Your fans are cheering you on,
you've got all the love

01:04:45.015 --> 01:04:47.082
of everybody, and everything I
had, it's up there.

01:04:47.084 --> 01:04:49.951
- I notice that you were kind
of making a heart sign

01:04:49.953 --> 01:04:52.287
in between obstacles.
What was that all about?

01:04:52.289 --> 01:04:53.755
- I think everybody
should love themselves

01:04:53.757 --> 01:04:55.790
and love each other.
That's what I'm all about.

01:04:55.792 --> 01:04:57.058
That's what I'm gonna
do... inspire people

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.627
<i>to be more loving
and more giving.</i>

01:04:58.629 --> 01:05:01.229
- Well, we love you too,
and we're so excited for you

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:03.732
to bring all of that love
to Las Vegas, Sean.

01:05:03.734 --> 01:05:06.534
- Whoo!
- Congratulations.

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:07.836
You guys go celebrate.

01:05:07.838 --> 01:05:09.671
Matt and Akbar, back to you.

01:05:12.342 --> 01:05:14.075
<i>- Well, she seems to make
history every time</i>

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:16.144
<i>she hits the course.</i>

01:05:16.146 --> 01:05:18.346
<i>What is Jessie Graff
gonna do tonight?</i>

01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:20.448
<i>We'll see her run
when we come back</i>

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:22.784
<i>on "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:27.989
<i>- The Internet
is about to blow up!</i>

01:05:27.991 --> 01:05:30.725
<i>Last season, Jessie Graff,
broke barriers,</i>

01:05:30.727 --> 01:05:34.029
<i>becoming the first woman
to finish Stage 1.</i>

01:05:34.031 --> 01:05:37.065
<i>Jessie Graff has done it!</i>

01:05:37.067 --> 01:05:39.935
<i>And then, in our USA vs.
The World competition,</i>

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:42.771
<i>she finished Stage 2.</i>

01:05:42.773 --> 01:05:45.941
<i>Making history again!</i>

01:05:45.943 --> 01:05:48.743
<i>Now here she comes again.</i>

01:05:48.745 --> 01:05:51.012
<i>What's Jessie
gonna do this time?</i>

01:05:51.014 --> 01:05:53.381
<i>This stuntwoman
from Calabasas, California,</i>

01:05:53.383 --> 01:05:55.350
<i>is trying to earn her
third straight trip</i>

01:05:55.352 --> 01:05:57.018
<i>to the national finals,</i>

01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:59.854
<i>but there's one obstacle
in her way.</i>

01:05:59.856 --> 01:06:02.390
Jessie! Jessie!
Jessie! Jessie!

01:06:02.392 --> 01:06:04.559
<i>- I thought I would be able
to finish this qualifier.</i>

01:06:04.561 --> 01:06:06.928
<i>- This is a beast.
- This is a monster.</i>

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:09.898
- I'm definitely disappointed
that I didn't.

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.366
<i>- Over a minute.</i>

01:06:11.368 --> 01:06:12.801
- No!
- No!

01:06:12.803 --> 01:06:15.470
<i>- Rolling Thunder...
it's just so tricky.</i>

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:18.206
The women who I saw do it
last year... a lot of them

01:06:18.208 --> 01:06:19.975
I think are
a bit stronger than me.

01:06:19.977 --> 01:06:21.943
<i>- Oh!
- No!</i>

01:06:21.945 --> 01:06:25.914
<i>- So, like, seeing them
fall on it, I was like,</i>

01:06:25.916 --> 01:06:27.816
"Okay, this is harder
than it looks."

01:06:27.818 --> 01:06:30.919
<i>- This is the obstacle that
took her out in qualifying.</i>

01:06:30.921 --> 01:06:33.288
<i>In fact, no woman
has made it past it.</i>

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:35.123
<i>- The Rolling Thunder
was definitely</i>

01:06:35.125 --> 01:06:36.725
a difficult obstacle.

01:06:36.727 --> 01:06:38.460
<i>Having to move
backwards through it,</i>

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:39.527
<i>keeping your momentum going.</i>

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:40.528
It was a struggle.

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:41.830
<i>- She's going for it.</i>

01:06:41.832 --> 01:06:43.531
<i>- She's going for
the dismount!</i>

01:06:43.533 --> 01:06:45.867
<i>Yes! Yes!</i>

01:06:45.869 --> 01:06:47.135
- I believe that Jessie Graff
definitely

01:06:47.137 --> 01:06:50.071
is gonna be able
to get through it.

01:06:50.073 --> 01:06:51.473
<i>- It's definitely a relief
knowing</i>

01:06:51.475 --> 01:06:52.974
<i>that I have a second chance,</i>

01:06:52.976 --> 01:06:56.111
but it's also intimidating
knowing that, "Oh, snag.

01:06:56.113 --> 01:06:57.846
<i>I didn't even finish
Rolling Thunder."</i>

01:06:57.848 --> 01:07:00.615
So I'm just gonna have
to be smarter and faster

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:02.917
and see what I can do
to get it done.

01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:08.089
<i>- Well, everyone's gonna be
watching this,</i>

01:07:08.091 --> 01:07:09.657
<i>including Jessie Labreck,</i>

01:07:09.659 --> 01:07:11.026
<i>who we just heard from.</i>

01:07:11.028 --> 01:07:12.961
<i>- And Daniel Gil...</i>
- You got it, Jess!

01:07:12.963 --> 01:07:15.730
<i>- Plus Jessie's mom
and good friend, Maggi Thorne,</i>

01:07:15.732 --> 01:07:17.432
<i>all on the sidelines.</i>

01:07:19.102 --> 01:07:20.435
- You got it, Jess!

01:07:20.437 --> 01:07:21.770
<i>- Well, Jessie's runs
from last season</i>

01:07:21.772 --> 01:07:23.738
<i>all became viral sensations.</i>

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:26.708
<i>Something like
80 million views.</i>

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:28.443
<i>Gets through the Floating
Steps,</i>

01:07:28.445 --> 01:07:31.012
<i>heading up
to the Rolling Pin.</i>

01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:34.716
<i>- Trying to figure it out,
thinking it through,</i>

01:07:34.718 --> 01:07:36.885
<i>and look, grabbing her leg
like a pretzel</i>

01:07:36.887 --> 01:07:39.320
<i>to keep them from
falling down.</i>

01:07:39.322 --> 01:07:40.622
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:07:40.624 --> 01:07:42.290
<i>- Hard fall,
but she is through.</i>

01:07:42.292 --> 01:07:44.359
- Deep breath, Jessie!

01:07:44.361 --> 01:07:46.661
<i>- And now steps up
to the Wingnuts.</i>

01:07:46.663 --> 01:07:50.031
<i>Jessie does stunt work in many
top TV shows and movies,</i>

01:07:50.033 --> 01:07:53.501
<i>and also does trapeze work,
so she knows how to fly.</i>

01:07:53.503 --> 01:07:55.437
<i>Makes the first grab.</i>

01:07:55.439 --> 01:07:57.972
<i>- She's also got that
experience as a pole vaulter</i>

01:07:57.974 --> 01:07:59.908
<i>back at the University
of Nebraska.</i>

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:03.278
<i>She's strong upper
and lower body.</i>

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.213
<i>- Taking a couple
extra swings here.</i>

01:08:05.215 --> 01:08:06.948
<i>- Whoa, whoa.</i>

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:08.817
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, come on now. Come on.</i>

01:08:08.819 --> 01:08:12.020
<i>Don't play with my feelings
like that, Jessie.</i>

01:08:12.022 --> 01:08:14.456
<i>- And now she's through.</i>

01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:16.591
<i>And now to the Broken Bridge.</i>

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:19.060
<i>It's the extreme variations
on these steps</i>

01:08:19.062 --> 01:08:22.162
<i>that makes it so hard,
going down, then up.</i>

01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:23.465
<i>- Nice on the feet. Yep.</i>

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:25.233
<i>- All right,
and she's done it.</i>

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:29.470
<i>So now it's the one she really
wants, Rolling Thunder.</i>

01:08:29.473 --> 01:08:31.473
- You know what it feels
like now. Come on.

01:08:31.475 --> 01:08:33.241
<i>- As we mentioned earlier,
"Flex" Labreck,</i>

01:08:33.243 --> 01:08:37.045
<i>the only woman
to get past this obstacle.</i>

01:08:37.046 --> 01:08:39.046
<i>Let's see if Jessie takes
a different approach.</i>

01:08:39.049 --> 01:08:40.849
<i>Already moving quickly.</i>

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.716
<i>- Well, watch it. Okay, so
qualifying, it got her...</i>

01:08:42.719 --> 01:08:44.185
<i>- Whoa.
- She took off her sleeves.</i>

01:08:44.187 --> 01:08:46.386
<i>She's ready to fight
this big old thing.</i>

01:08:46.389 --> 01:08:48.523
<i>- But you could see that drop
was a hard impact, Akbar.</i>

01:08:48.524 --> 01:08:50.258
<i>it seemed to interrupt
her rhythm.</i>

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:51.725
<i>- Yeah. Watch her
slow it down there.</i>

01:08:51.728 --> 01:08:53.194
<i>- There we go. Much better.</i>

01:08:53.196 --> 01:08:54.496
<i>- Did you see, though,
when she did that?</i>

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:55.897
<i>She slowed down that last
drop,</i>

01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:57.465
<i>so it didn't bounce her
off.</i>

01:08:57.466 --> 01:09:00.234
<i>Now look at all those
muscles coming through.</i>

01:09:00.237 --> 01:09:02.036
<i>- Ooh, slow it down.
- Oh, long reach!</i>

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:03.537
<i>- That danged old
Plexiglas again.</i>

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:04.805
<i>- Got it.</i>

01:09:04.808 --> 01:09:06.006
<i>- Break that Plexiglas.
- Oh, my,</i>

01:09:06.009 --> 01:09:08.510
<i>those arms fully extended,</i>

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:11.179
<i>and she flipped around, Akbar,</i>

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:14.381
<i>- looking for the dismount.
- Yeah!</i>

01:09:14.384 --> 01:09:17.152
<i>- Only Jessie Labreck
has gotten through it.</i>

01:09:17.154 --> 01:09:20.388
<i>- Whoo-hoo!</i>

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:21.890
Yes!

01:09:21.892 --> 01:09:24.626
<i>- Jessie Graff does it.</i>

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:26.461
- Well, we saw Jesse
Labreck do it last year,

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:30.298
and now we see Jessie Graff
do it this year.

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.834
- Now facing the Warped Wall.

01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:34.636
<i>Jessie's one of
the handful of women</i>

01:09:34.638 --> 01:09:38.406
<i>who've made it up
in competition.</i>

01:09:38.408 --> 01:09:41.776
<i>And she does it again!</i>

01:09:42.812 --> 01:09:45.313
<i>And this crowd loving it.</i>

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:48.383
<i>Well, she's gone farther
than any women tonight,</i>

01:09:48.385 --> 01:09:51.319
<i>so she's guaranteed to go
back to the national finals,</i>

01:09:51.321 --> 01:09:55.523
<i>but how far can she go
on this grueling course?</i>

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:57.725
- Stay calm!
<i>- In case you didn't notice,</i>

01:09:57.727 --> 01:09:59.460
<i>there's still
no finisher tonight.</i>

01:09:59.462 --> 01:10:01.329
<i>I think Jessie can do it.</i>

01:10:01.331 --> 01:10:03.131
<i>- Well, the first test
is the Salmon Ladder.</i>

01:10:03.133 --> 01:10:05.333
<i>She faced this
in the city finals the past</i>

01:10:05.335 --> 01:10:08.536
<i>two years;
got past it both times.</i>

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:11.739
<i>Good precision.</i>

01:10:11.741 --> 01:10:13.374
<i>- All right, one more.
- There we go.</i>

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:15.109
<i>- That's it.
- Look at this.</i>

01:10:15.111 --> 01:10:17.478
<i>Jessie Graff just warming up.</i>

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.481
<i>But these Giant Cubes have
been giant killers all night.</i>

01:10:20.483 --> 01:10:22.150
<i>Can she figure it out?</i>

01:10:22.152 --> 01:10:24.452
<i>Well, the pole vaulter... this
is a familiar position,</i>

01:10:24.454 --> 01:10:25.787
<i>keeping that body around.</i>

01:10:25.789 --> 01:10:28.389
<i>- Oh, yes. Nice.
- But reaching up.</i>

01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:30.792
<i>- Uh-oh. She's using that
rock climbing technique.</i>

01:10:30.794 --> 01:10:33.761
<i>- Look at the flexibility.
- Oh, my goodness.</i>

01:10:33.763 --> 01:10:37.232
<i>You look like Spider Woman.</i>

01:10:37.234 --> 01:10:43.504
<i>- Jessie Graff, 5'8", 130.</i>

01:10:43.506 --> 01:10:46.841
<i>So powerful.</i>

01:10:46.843 --> 01:10:49.310
<i>- Yeah,
get your feet on the wall.</i>

01:10:49.312 --> 01:10:50.712
<i>Get your feet on the wall.</i>

01:10:50.714 --> 01:10:52.413
<i>It takes stress off
of the upper body.</i>

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:54.015
<i>- There we go.
- Now they're just dangling.</i>

01:10:54.017 --> 01:10:55.350
<i>- Yeah, she's just showing
off.</i>

01:10:55.352 --> 01:10:57.485
<i>She's just showing off
her upper body.</i>

01:10:57.487 --> 01:10:59.187
<i>- Just a great transition
there</i>

01:10:59.189 --> 01:11:00.355
<i>to get those feet back up.</i>

01:11:00.357 --> 01:11:02.657
<i>Can she make this flip?</i>

01:11:02.659 --> 01:11:05.193
<i>- Whoa!
- She's reaching out!</i>

01:11:05.195 --> 01:11:06.628
- You're kidding me!

01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:09.497
- She's doing the splits!
- What? Oh, my goodness.

01:11:09.499 --> 01:11:11.566
<i>- Oh, wow.
- Shut the front door!</i>

01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:14.002
<i>- I don't know that anyone
even thought of doing that.</i>

01:11:14.004 --> 01:11:15.003
<i>- I don't know,
she just reached out</i>

01:11:15.005 --> 01:11:16.471
<i>and touched somebody.</i>

01:11:16.473 --> 01:11:20.775
<i>That's the Jessie Graff way!</i>

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:24.345
<i>- That's why we love watching
this woman perform,</i>

01:11:24.347 --> 01:11:26.814
<i>redefining the limits.</i>

01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:30.018
<i>- I am signing up
for yoga class today.</i>

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:32.754
<i>- Are you kidding me?</i>

01:11:32.756 --> 01:11:36.057
<i>Still has to get around
to the other side.</i>

01:11:36.059 --> 01:11:37.759
<i>- Well, once again,
we saw this</i>

01:11:37.761 --> 01:11:39.227
<i>in Los Angeles. Jessie Graff...</i>

01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:40.495
<i>- She didn't use her
spider webs!</i>

01:11:40.497 --> 01:11:42.030
<i>She didn't use her
spider webs!</i>

01:11:42.032 --> 01:11:44.432
<i>- And she's through!</i>

01:11:45.502 --> 01:11:48.536
<i>The greatness of Jessie Graff!</i>

01:11:48.538 --> 01:11:52.740
<i>Tonight, we are seeing what
this woman is capable of.</i>

01:11:52.742 --> 01:11:56.477
<i>And now facing another brutal
challenge, the Circuit Board.</i>

01:11:56.479 --> 01:12:00.515
<i>Only two competitors
have survived it tonight.</i>

01:12:00.517 --> 01:12:02.050
<i>She's has actually made it
to the ninth obstacle</i>

01:12:02.052 --> 01:12:03.384
<i>the past two years,</i>

01:12:03.386 --> 01:12:06.754
<i>but hasn't been able
to get past it,</i>

01:12:06.756 --> 01:12:08.122
<i>and it won't be easy tonight.</i>

01:12:08.124 --> 01:12:10.191
<i>This Circuit Board
can be so taxing,</i>

01:12:10.193 --> 01:12:14.495
<i>especially coming after
the eight obstacles before it.</i>

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:17.231
<i>And look at this precise
approach out of Jessie Graff,</i>

01:12:17.233 --> 01:12:19.167
<i>really using the lower body
for momentum.</i>

01:12:19.169 --> 01:12:21.936
<i>- I like it, Akbar.
- She doesn't even look tired.</i>

01:12:21.938 --> 01:12:24.272
<i>- Gets through
the first board.</i>

01:12:24.274 --> 01:12:26.307
<i>Down to just one hand.</i>

01:12:26.309 --> 01:12:31.212
<i>But doesn't panic. Saves it
and just keeps moving.</i>

01:12:31.214 --> 01:12:33.548
<i>- I'm telling you, she's
dressed like a superhero,</i>

01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:35.283
<i>and she's performing like one.</i>

01:12:35.285 --> 01:12:38.019
<i>- Only about halfway through,</i>

01:12:38.021 --> 01:12:40.655
<i>and again, down to one
hand.</i>

01:12:40.657 --> 01:12:41.923
<i>Saves it once more.</i>

01:12:41.925 --> 01:12:44.992
<i>- Look at that.
- Come on, Jessie.</i>

01:12:44.994 --> 01:12:47.428
- Move in control, Jess.

01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:49.630
<i>- Almost through
the second board,</i>

01:12:49.632 --> 01:12:53.234
<i>and she's smiling,
like it's a walk in the park.</i>

01:12:53.236 --> 01:12:54.769
<i>- You don't really see
her grimace.</i>

01:12:54.771 --> 01:12:57.872
<i>- Making that transition.
- Onto the third board!</i>

01:12:57.874 --> 01:12:59.340
<i>She's on the third board,
Matt.</i>

01:12:59.342 --> 01:13:00.808
<i>- I think she's gonna go
for the dismount!</i>

01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:02.910
<i>- She's going for it!
- She's going for it!</i>

01:13:02.912 --> 01:13:04.779
- All right!
- Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:13:04.781 --> 01:13:07.482
- She got it!

01:13:08.985 --> 01:13:12.687
<i>- I think even she's
a bit surprised.</i>

01:13:12.689 --> 01:13:14.789
<i>Kacy Catanzaro,
the only other woman</i>

01:13:14.791 --> 01:13:17.525
<i>to make it this far
on a city finals course,</i>

01:13:17.527 --> 01:13:19.360
<i>and now Jessie is looking up</i>

01:13:19.362 --> 01:13:23.431
<i>at the 35-foot tower
of the Elevator Climb.</i>

01:13:23.433 --> 01:13:25.500
- Come on, Jessie!

01:13:25.502 --> 01:13:27.201
<i>- She'll be the first woman
ever</i>

01:13:27.203 --> 01:13:31.606
<i>to try this obstacle, and
no one has beaten it tonight.</i>

01:13:31.608 --> 01:13:33.908
<i>- I'm telling you,
if she gets to the top,</i>

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:36.511
<i>I'm running out of the booth,
and I'm running up there.</i>

01:13:36.513 --> 01:13:39.313
<i>- And here we go.
- On the elevator climb.</i>

01:13:39.315 --> 01:13:41.682
<i>- She's got that extra thing.</i>

01:13:41.684 --> 01:13:44.051
<i>She's got the "get" factor,
and that's for sure.</i>

01:13:44.053 --> 01:13:45.653
<i>- The arms are straight.</i>

01:13:45.655 --> 01:13:47.722
<i>She's using the body,
and she's smiling.</i>

01:13:47.724 --> 01:13:49.824
<i>Come on!</i>

01:13:49.826 --> 01:13:51.559
<i>- At this point she's...
- 15 feet!</i>

01:13:51.561 --> 01:13:53.528
<i>- 15 feet.
- She's got a lot... come on.</i>

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:55.530
<i>I don't see spider webs
coming out.</i>

01:13:55.532 --> 01:13:59.434
<i>I just see Jessie Graff.</i>

01:14:02.872 --> 01:14:06.174
<i>- Everyone here trying
to will her to the top.</i>

01:14:06.176 --> 01:14:08.409
<i>Does she have anything left?</i>

01:14:08.411 --> 01:14:10.578
<i>- She's saying "no mas."
- Come on!</i>

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:12.780
<i>- She's saying "no mas."
I say yes.</i>

01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:14.782
<i>- Oh!
- Oh.</i>

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:17.251
<i>- Can't quite make it
to the top,</i>

01:14:17.253 --> 01:14:22.156
<i>as we got to witness
the amazing Jessie Graff.</i>

01:14:22.158 --> 01:14:23.658
<i>- Namaste!</i>

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:25.193
<i>Check out her
doing the splits</i>

01:14:25.195 --> 01:14:28.429
<i>across that six-foot gap
between the Giant Cubes.</i>

01:14:28.431 --> 01:14:30.331
<i>No one had tried that before.</i>

01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:32.133
<i>Then she barely makes it</i>

01:14:32.135 --> 01:14:34.001
<i>to the landing pad
on the Circuit Board,</i>

01:14:34.003 --> 01:14:37.205
<i>but halfway up the Elevator
Climb, she was done.</i>

01:14:37.207 --> 01:14:40.141
<i>- Let's go down to Kristine,
who's standing by with Jessie.</i>

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:42.076
- Jessie, describe to me
the feeling

01:14:42.078 --> 01:14:43.911
when you're going up
the Elevator Climb.

01:14:43.913 --> 01:14:46.047
I know you were so pumped.
What's that like?

01:14:46.049 --> 01:14:48.649
- Well, obviously, like,

01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:51.385
finishing
and hitting the buzzer

01:14:51.387 --> 01:14:53.788
is an amazingly
satisfying feeling,

01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:55.823
but to me, like,
the biggest thing

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:57.959
I've gotten out of this whole
"Ninja Warrior" experience

01:14:57.961 --> 01:14:59.994
is enjoying that moment of,

01:14:59.996 --> 01:15:02.497
like, I am at my limit,
I am pushing as hard as I can.

01:15:02.499 --> 01:15:04.065
<i>In that moment, like,</i>

01:15:04.067 --> 01:15:06.467
<i>I think you can see me
just smiling my face off,</i>

01:15:06.469 --> 01:15:09.971
<i>because I'm like, "I'm getting
so much stronger right now."</i>

01:15:09.973 --> 01:15:11.439
- You look like you're having
such a great time.

01:15:11.441 --> 01:15:13.774
You gave us the splits
tonight, smiles tonight,

01:15:13.776 --> 01:15:15.676
so thank you for that, Jessie.

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:17.945
Enjoy your evening,
and congratulations.

01:15:17.947 --> 01:15:19.814
- I will. Thank you so much.

01:15:19.816 --> 01:15:22.383
- Matt and Akbar, back to you.

01:15:22.385 --> 01:15:24.418
<i>- Always tough to top
Jessie Graff,</i>

01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:27.655
<i>but our final runner
is gonna be Drew Drechsel.</i>

01:15:27.657 --> 01:15:29.724
<i>Can he be our first finisher?</i>

01:15:29.726 --> 01:15:33.160
<i>His run's up next on
"American Ninja Warrior."</i>

01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:39.800
<i>- Welcome back to the last few
minutes of the city finals</i>

01:15:39.802 --> 01:15:41.802
.<i>in Daytona Beach, Florida.</i>

01:15:41.804 --> 01:15:44.739
<i>While we were away,
eight-time ninja veteran</i>

01:15:44.741 --> 01:15:47.208
<i>Travis Rosen got his shot
at the course.</i>

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:50.278
<i>He gets better with age.</i>

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:53.948
<i>At 42 years old, he did
the splits on the Giant Cubes,</i>

01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:56.951
<i>just like Jessie Graff
did minutes ago.</i>

01:15:56.953 --> 01:15:58.853
<i>He's got a little longer
reach.</i>

01:15:58.855 --> 01:16:00.755
<i>Aha!</i>

01:16:00.757 --> 01:16:02.823
<i>The stock trader from
Franklin, Tennessee,</i>

01:16:02.825 --> 01:16:05.226
<i>finally gassed out
on the Circuit Board...</i>

01:16:05.228 --> 01:16:07.261
<i>- No!
- Sha na na.</i>

01:16:07.263 --> 01:16:09.130
<i>- But it's good enough
to send him back</i>

01:16:09.132 --> 01:16:10.898
<i>to the national finals.</i>

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:14.468
<i>Eighth time back to Vegas.</i>

01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:17.038
<i>Well, there's only
one athlete left with a chance</i>

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.573
<i>to beat this course,</i>

01:16:18.575 --> 01:16:21.108
<i>but he really is one of
the best ever.</i>

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:24.045
<i>It's the real life ninja,
Drew Drechsel.</i>

01:16:24.047 --> 01:16:25.780
<i>- Whoo!
- Running here at</i>

01:16:25.782 --> 01:16:27.348
<i>the Daytona
International Speedway</i>

01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:29.083
<i>has special meaning for Drew.</i>

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:33.521
<i>In fact, his career
started in cars.</i>

01:16:34.857 --> 01:16:36.824
<i>- Before I was the real-life
ninja,</i>

01:16:36.826 --> 01:16:38.359
I was a real-life car salesman.

01:16:38.361 --> 01:16:39.961
Hey, guys.
My name's Drew Drechsel.

01:16:39.963 --> 01:16:42.096
I'm here in Gainesville,
Florida, at Magic Imports.

01:16:42.098 --> 01:16:43.798
<i>I used to work
at a car dealership</i>

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:45.399
<i>selling cars
and doing marketing,</i>

01:16:45.401 --> 01:16:47.034
<i>and before that,
it was detailing.</i>

01:16:47.036 --> 01:16:49.737
<i>Is this stow-and-go?
Sweet.</i>

01:16:49.739 --> 01:16:51.839
<i>I look back, and I wish
I had realized earlier that,</i>

01:16:51.841 --> 01:16:54.041
<i>when I was working
at a car dealership,</i>

01:16:54.043 --> 01:16:56.777
<i>I was wasting myself.</i>

01:16:56.779 --> 01:16:58.813
It just wasn't enough
to work that 9:00 to 5:00,

01:16:58.815 --> 01:17:00.414
<i>get off work,
and go to the gym,</i>

01:17:00.416 --> 01:17:01.849
<i>and train for three
or four hours.</i>

01:17:01.851 --> 01:17:04.318
<i>I definitely needed
to take a step back</i>

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.621
<i>and reevaluate what
I was doing with my life,</i>

01:17:06.623 --> 01:17:10.891
<i>and I decided to become
a full-time ninja.</i>

01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:14.128
<i>- He's a 23-year-old used car
lot marketing manager.</i>

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:15.730
<i>- This is my seventh year
competing.</i>

01:17:15.732 --> 01:17:18.866
<i>- He blows away
the fastest time threshold!</i>

01:17:18.868 --> 01:17:20.401
<i>- Every year, I'm getting
a little bit stronger,</i>

01:17:20.403 --> 01:17:21.702
<i>I'm learning a lot more
things.</i>

01:17:21.704 --> 01:17:23.604
<i>- He is destroying
this course.</i>

01:17:23.606 --> 01:17:25.239
<i>- Yeah, baby!</i>

01:17:25.241 --> 01:17:26.974
<i>- This is what
I was born to do,</i>

01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:29.143
<i>is just demolish
obstacle courses.</i>

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:32.113
<i>- We haven't seen anyone
remotely close to this point.</i>

01:17:32.115 --> 01:17:33.781
- Pretty cool that I went
from selling cars

01:17:33.783 --> 01:17:36.817
to now taking the
checkered flag in Daytona.

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:40.454
<i>- The fastest time
by over 30 seconds!</i>

01:17:40.456 --> 01:17:41.956
<i>- I mean, what's left other
than</i>

01:17:41.958 --> 01:17:43.224
<i>just winning it all, right?</i>

01:17:45.928 --> 01:17:48.763
<i>- Drew's girlfriend, April,
will be watching,</i>

01:17:48.765 --> 01:17:50.765
<i>along with every ninja here,</i>

01:17:50.767 --> 01:17:53.701
<i>but especially the pec-flexing
firefighter, Eddy Stewart.</i>

01:17:53.703 --> 01:17:56.704
<i>He's on the bubble
in 15th place.</i>

01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:02.677
<i>Well, only once in "American
Ninja Warrior" history</i>

01:18:02.679 --> 01:18:04.779
<i>has a course
remained undefeated.</i>

01:18:04.781 --> 01:18:06.914
<i>That was last year in
the Philadelphia city finals.</i>

01:18:06.916 --> 01:18:09.550
<i>Right now, Drew Drechsel
is the only one</i>

01:18:09.552 --> 01:18:10.985
<i>who can keep Daytona</i>

01:18:10.987 --> 01:18:13.087
<i>from joining that
undistinguished list.</i>

01:18:17.493 --> 01:18:19.293
<i>- Ooh, a little funky
on the landing.</i>

01:18:19.295 --> 01:18:22.430
<i>All right. Gets right back up
to take on the Wingnuts.</i>

01:18:22.432 --> 01:18:24.131
<i>- Well, he's known
for going fast,</i>

01:18:24.133 --> 01:18:26.434
<i>but last year,
we saw he could go far.</i>

01:18:26.436 --> 01:18:29.904
<i>He dominated every phase of
"American Ninja Warrior,"</i>

01:18:29.906 --> 01:18:32.306
<i>going farther than anyone
in the regular season,</i>

01:18:32.308 --> 01:18:35.342
<i>winning the skills competition
and the Supersonic Shelf Grab,</i>

01:18:35.344 --> 01:18:37.311
<i>leading Team USA to victory</i>

01:18:37.313 --> 01:18:39.180
<i>and completing Stage 3
in the process.</i>

01:18:39.182 --> 01:18:41.048
<i>- Just go ahead and say it.
- He's a metahuman.</i>

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:45.453
<i>Watch him work here
on the Broken Bridge.</i>

01:18:45.455 --> 01:18:47.221
<i>Wow.</i>

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:50.157
<i>- Drechsel has confidence.
- He is destroying this course.</i>

01:18:50.159 --> 01:18:53.494
- You've got this, Drew.
- You've got this.

01:18:53.496 --> 01:18:55.162
<i>- All right,
hit the Ninja Speedway</i>

01:18:55.164 --> 01:18:56.864
<i>here on Rolling Thunder.</i>

01:18:56.866 --> 01:18:59.700
<i>- Drew Drechsel really relied
on athleticism early on,</i>

01:18:59.702 --> 01:19:01.502
<i>but now he's combined
a mental approach.</i>

01:19:01.504 --> 01:19:03.671
<i>- Drew Drechsel
throws a big punch. 5'9",</i>

01:19:03.673 --> 01:19:05.339
<i>160 pounds,</i>

01:19:05.341 --> 01:19:07.374
<i>and he is throwing this big
wheel around</i>

01:19:07.376 --> 01:19:08.743
<i>like it's nothing.</i>

01:19:08.745 --> 01:19:10.411
<i>He's moving through this
faster</i>

01:19:10.413 --> 01:19:11.746
<i>than anyone we've seen.</i>

01:19:11.748 --> 01:19:13.114
<i>- He's getting close
to the dismount.</i>

01:19:13.116 --> 01:19:16.517
<i>This guy is a beast.</i>

01:19:16.519 --> 01:19:18.152
<i>Wow!</i>

01:19:18.154 --> 01:19:21.222
<i>Just 17 seconds through
the Rolling Thunder.</i>

01:19:21.224 --> 01:19:24.925
Listening to some music
to get up the Warped Wall.

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:27.695
- He might have Michael
Jackson's "Beat It" here.

01:19:27.697 --> 01:19:32.700
- Right up the Warped Wall!
- No surprise.

01:19:32.702 --> 01:19:34.869
<i>So now if he finishes
the Salmon Ladder,</i>

01:19:34.871 --> 01:19:37.938
<i>he ensures himself
a spot in the top 15,</i>

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.039
<i>and he'll have three
more obstacles to go</i>

01:19:39.041 --> 01:19:41.642
<i>if he wants to finish.</i>

01:19:41.644 --> 01:19:45.079
<i>- This crowd definitely wants
to see him reach the buzzer.</i>

01:19:45.081 --> 01:19:48.082
<i>- And Drechsel goes right up
onto the Salmon Ladder.</i>

01:19:48.084 --> 01:19:52.853
<i>He is not playing around.</i>

01:19:52.855 --> 01:19:55.322
<i>Gotta touch that bar.
Got it!</i>

01:19:55.324 --> 01:19:57.892
<i>And we say good-bye
to Eddy Stewart.</i>

01:19:57.894 --> 01:19:59.794
<i>Maybe next year, man.</i>

01:19:59.796 --> 01:20:02.830
<i>Drew Drechsel is
going back to Vegas.</i>

01:20:02.832 --> 01:20:04.765
<i>- Okay, his spot is safe.</i>

01:20:04.767 --> 01:20:06.467
<i>Now, I want to see
Drew Drechsel</i>

01:20:06.469 --> 01:20:08.936
<i>let it all out
and go for that buzzer.</i>

01:20:08.938 --> 01:20:11.338
<i>- First up are
these Giant Cubes.</i>

01:20:14.210 --> 01:20:16.210
<i>- Let's see if he applies
the Jessie Graff technique</i>

01:20:16.212 --> 01:20:19.613
<i>on the back half
of this Giant Cube.</i>

01:20:19.615 --> 01:20:21.816
<i>Oh, oh, oh.</i>

01:20:21.818 --> 01:20:24.451
<i>- I don't know if he has
the flexibility.</i>

01:20:24.453 --> 01:20:26.554
<i>At 5'9", he's about Graff's
size.</i>

01:20:26.556 --> 01:20:28.055
<i>There we go!</i>

01:20:28.057 --> 01:20:29.990
<i>- You do all the flying
and the hopping.</i>

01:20:29.992 --> 01:20:31.525
<i>Let Jessie Graff do
the yoga.</i>

01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:32.827
<i>- I love that he tested it,</i>

01:20:32.829 --> 01:20:34.261
<i>and he goes,
"No, I can't do it."</i>

01:20:34.263 --> 01:20:38.966
<i>Dismounts from the side,
the real-life ninja.</i>

01:20:41.537 --> 01:20:46.140
<i>He's barely stopping
to catch his breath.</i>

01:20:46.142 --> 01:20:48.509
<i>Stepping right up
to the Circuit Board.</i>

01:20:48.511 --> 01:20:51.445
<i>This is another obstacle that
just wears you down</i>

01:20:51.447 --> 01:20:54.114
<i>for the Elevator Climb
that comes after it.</i>

01:20:54.116 --> 01:20:57.952
<i>- And you can tell,
he came in with a plan.</i>

01:20:57.954 --> 01:21:00.054
<i>- Just perfect placement.</i>

01:21:00.056 --> 01:21:03.157
<i>Not moving fast, but moving
in perfect control.</i>

01:21:03.159 --> 01:21:06.827
<i>- You know, I think Drew made
a good career decision</i>

01:21:06.829 --> 01:21:09.864
<i>to give up selling cars
to become a full-time ninja.</i>

01:21:09.866 --> 01:21:11.832
<i>I think that decision's
paying off.</i>

01:21:16.372 --> 01:21:20.908
<i>- Already on that third board,
and he's looking to dismount,</i>

01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:23.978
<i>and he's going for the lache.
Yeah!</i>

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:25.913
<i>- And he's through.</i>

01:21:25.915 --> 01:21:28.349
<i>Got through
that obstacle quickly.</i>

01:21:28.351 --> 01:21:30.851
<i>And I like it... save some
energy</i>

01:21:30.853 --> 01:21:34.255
<i>for this, the Elevator Climb.</i>

01:21:34.257 --> 01:21:37.558
<i>The course has been
undefeated tonight.</i>

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:41.795
<i>Drew Drechsel, the last man
with a chance to hit a buzzer.</i>

01:21:41.797 --> 01:21:43.631
Go, Drew, go!
Go, Drew, go!

01:21:43.633 --> 01:21:46.100
<i>- All right. Here we go.</i>

01:21:46.102 --> 01:21:47.935
<i>And he's up.</i>

01:21:47.937 --> 01:21:49.870
<i>- That's it. That's it.</i>

01:21:49.872 --> 01:21:51.438
<i>Uh-oh.
Matt, that's good rhythm.</i>

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:52.606
<i>- Climbing it.
- That's good rhythm.</i>

01:21:52.608 --> 01:21:54.742
<i>- And look at those long
reaches.</i>

01:21:54.744 --> 01:21:55.976
<i>- He's got plenty
of strength left.</i>

01:21:55.978 --> 01:21:57.378
<i>- Oh, my!</i>

01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:59.313
<i>- He's about
to bring this house down!</i>

01:21:59.315 --> 01:22:02.783
<i>- Daniel Gil did it on
the final run last week.</i>

01:22:02.785 --> 01:22:05.686
<i>Can Drew Drechsel
the same tonight?</i>

01:22:05.688 --> 01:22:08.656
<i>And you can use your feet,
but if the elevator tries</i>

01:22:08.658 --> 01:22:11.358
<i>to bring you down,
go crazy.</i>

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:13.661
<i>- Come on, now.
- He's tipping.</i>

01:22:13.663 --> 01:22:16.330
<i>- If this elevator stops,
go right through the top.</i>

01:22:16.332 --> 01:22:18.132
<i>- It's your only exit.
- Five feet away!</i>

01:22:18.134 --> 01:22:20.167
<i>- There's
the button.</i>

01:22:20.169 --> 01:22:23.170
<i>- Yes!
- There's a real-life ninja!</i>

01:22:23.172 --> 01:22:24.705
<i>- Oh, my!</i>

01:22:24.707 --> 01:22:27.374
<i>- The last run of the night,
he's gonna do it!</i>

01:22:27.376 --> 01:22:31.211
<i>- I see you, boy!</i>

01:22:31.213 --> 01:22:32.980
<i>The crowd is going nuts,
Matt.</i>

01:22:32.982 --> 01:22:34.515
<i>They're going nuts!</i>

01:22:34.517 --> 01:22:37.618
<i>- Drew Drechsel hits the
buzzer in the city finals.</i>

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:41.789
- Whoo! Yeah!

01:22:41.791 --> 01:22:43.857
<i>- That man was thirsty
for success,</i>

01:22:43.859 --> 01:22:46.160
<i>and of course that's our
POM Wonderful</i>

01:22:46.162 --> 01:22:48.262
<i>Crazy Healthy
Run of the Night.</i>

01:22:48.264 --> 01:22:51.465
<i>Drew Drechsel had a big
dismount on the Circuit Board</i>

01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:53.867
<i>and managed to fight
all the way to the top</i>

01:22:53.869 --> 01:22:56.370
<i>for the only buzzer
of the night.</i>

01:22:56.372 --> 01:22:57.938
<i>- Right now, he's standing
by with Kristine.</i>

01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:00.975
- Drew, I am so happy for you.

01:23:00.977 --> 01:23:02.609
Congratulations.

01:23:02.611 --> 01:23:06.580
The only finished of the night.
How did you do it?

01:23:06.582 --> 01:23:09.516
- It was really hard,
but I live in a gym.

01:23:09.518 --> 01:23:12.886
I basically live in a gym,
so as much as someone works

01:23:12.888 --> 01:23:14.455
is as much as I'm spending off

01:23:14.457 --> 01:23:16.423
<i>the ground hanging
from anything.</i>

01:23:16.425 --> 01:23:18.759
- How excited are you
to get back to Las Vegas?

01:23:18.761 --> 01:23:20.627
- Oh, man, I can't wait to
hang out with my friends

01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:23.030
and attack that course, and
to just... it's a great time.

01:23:23.032 --> 01:23:24.098
I'm super excited
to be going back.

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:25.466
<i>- All right, Drew.</i>

01:23:25.468 --> 01:23:27.534
<i>I am so excited
to see you in Las Vegas.</i>

01:23:27.536 --> 01:23:30.704
Congratulations.
The only finisher of the night.

01:23:30.706 --> 01:23:32.006
- Thank you very much,
Kristine. Thank you.

01:23:32.008 --> 01:23:35.809
- Matt and Akbar,
back to you.

01:23:35.811 --> 01:23:38.245
<i>- Drew Drechsel sits atop
the leaderboard,</i>

01:23:38.247 --> 01:23:40.781
<i>the only finisher tonight.</i>

01:23:40.783 --> 01:23:44.785
<i>Jessie Graff ended up 4th
among all competitors.</i>

01:23:44.787 --> 01:23:47.221
<i>He'll see all these athletes
at the national finals</i>

01:23:47.223 --> 01:23:49.590
<i>in a few weeks,
including Wingnut</i>

01:23:49.592 --> 01:23:52.426
<i>creator Kevin Carbone</i>

01:23:52.428 --> 01:23:54.595
<i>and Michael "Ice In His Veins"
Johnson,</i>

01:23:54.597 --> 01:23:57.464
<i>who got the 15th
and final spot.</i>

01:23:57.466 --> 01:24:00.167
<i>Joining Jessie Graff as
the second woman to advance</i>

01:24:00.169 --> 01:24:02.770
<i>is web developer
Lindsay Eskildsen.</i>

01:24:02.772 --> 01:24:05.539
<i>Next week, we'll be
in Cleveland, Ohio,</i>

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:08.675
<i>the fourth stop for our
city finals competition.</i>

01:24:08.677 --> 01:24:10.444
For Akbar Gbajabiamila
and Kristine Leahy,

01:24:10.446 --> 01:24:12.246
I'm Matt Iseman.

01:24:12.248 --> 01:24:15.749
<i>We'll see you next time
on "American Ninja Warrior."</i>
