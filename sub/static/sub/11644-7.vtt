00:00.575 --> 00:03.054
He said picking up litter
was the best time of his life.

00:03.055 --> 00:05.214
That demonstrates
his rather low expectations.

00:05.215 --> 00:08.134
I never said that about the litter.

00:08.135 --> 00:10.134
Where did you get that?
The guy in the mask.

00:10.135 --> 00:12.693
Who is he?
It's you.

00:12.695 --> 00:15.934
It's over. No more community service.

00:15.935 --> 00:18.894
And I have no job,
no money, no girlfriend.

00:18.895 --> 00:21.134
OK, so I'm immortal...

00:21.135 --> 00:24.294
but other than that I've basically
got fuck all going for me.

00:24.295 --> 00:25.734
Does anyone fancy a drink?

00:25.735 --> 00:27.774
Yeah, sure, man.

00:27.775 --> 00:30.414
You know, apart from all
the killing and the dying and stuff,

00:30.415 --> 00:34.414
it really wasn't as bad
as I thought it was going to be.

00:39.215 --> 00:43.214
# EELS: Christmas Is
Going To The Dogs

00:47.855 --> 00:50.814
# Get off your sled, and go to bed

00:50.815 --> 00:53.614
# Don't you ever tire?

00:53.615 --> 00:56.694
# Throw a bone, I'm finally home

00:56.695 --> 00:59.414
# Curled up by the fire

00:59.415 --> 01:01.894
# Snow is fallin' from the sky

01:01.895 --> 01:05.294
# Like ashes from an urn

01:05.295 --> 01:07.934
# Sweet dreams, my little one... #

01:07.935 --> 01:09.414
What a loser.

01:09.415 --> 01:11.014
# Now it's my turn... #

01:11.015 --> 01:13.094
Fuck you!

01:13.095 --> 01:17.094
# Well, Christmas
is going to the dogs... #

01:20.215 --> 01:24.214
Ah! Merry Christmas, little fella!

01:28.735 --> 01:30.974
Hey, I'm not a paedophile!

01:30.975 --> 01:34.094
Yeah... Ah... Ah... Ah...

01:34.095 --> 01:36.294
Oh! No! No...

01:36.295 --> 01:40.294
Oh, shit!

01:47.855 --> 01:51.854
# And Christmas is going to the dogs

01:53.535 --> 01:57.534
# We're scarfin' down the turkey
and eggnog

01:59.535 --> 02:03.534
# And things aren't looking
very good, it's true

02:05.335 --> 02:09.334
# So I'll just lay here, and chew

02:11.175 --> 02:15.094
# So I'll just stay here

02:15.095 --> 02:19.094
# And chew #

# The city breathing

02:37.575 --> 02:39.414
# The people churning

02:39.415 --> 02:41.094
# The conversating

02:41.095 --> 02:45.094
# The price is what?

02:57.095 --> 02:59.094
# The conversating

02:59.095 --> 03:00.974
# This place is heaven

03:00.975 --> 03:04.974
# And if you see them... #

03:29.452 --> 03:33.451
It was crap,
he nearly came in his pants...

03:34.172 --> 03:38.171
You should try giving him one...!
>

03:45.892 --> 03:48.091
You're going to break your neck.

03:48.092 --> 03:50.011
I'm not pushing you around
in a wheelchair.

03:50.012 --> 03:52.291
I have to learn sometime.

03:52.292 --> 03:56.131
Show me...

03:56.132 --> 03:59.651
You'd better do it.

03:59.652 --> 04:02.931
So being Santa sucks a big fat cock.

04:02.932 --> 04:04.891
Two pints of lager please, barmaid.

04:04.892 --> 04:07.331
Are you going to pay for them?
No.

04:07.332 --> 04:11.011
Oh, come on! I've been working for
the council scraping up dog shit.

04:11.012 --> 04:14.691
That's thirsty work.

04:14.692 --> 04:17.211
So how did it all
go so right for you?

04:17.212 --> 04:20.250
You end up with a cool flat,
and a beautiful girlfriend?

04:20.252 --> 04:21.771
I think it's dead romantic, I do.

04:21.772 --> 04:25.771
I think I liked it better when you
suffered from a crippling shyness.

04:28.332 --> 04:32.331
No way! No more free drink...

04:38.932 --> 04:40.891
You're going to get us both sacked.

04:40.892 --> 04:43.811
Do you really want to spend your
life working in some shitty bar?

04:43.812 --> 04:44.811
No...

04:44.812 --> 04:48.371
Then I'm doing you a favour.
Refill!

04:48.372 --> 04:51.171
This is fucking ridiculous!

04:51.172 --> 04:53.331
I had to walk back
from the other side of the estate.

04:53.332 --> 04:54.931
Are you OK?

05:05.212 --> 05:06.171
Want a look?!

05:06.172 --> 05:07.891
I wouldn't mind.

05:07.892 --> 05:11.891
After all, it is nearly Christmas.

05:18.692 --> 05:22.331
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
That's how babies become dwarfs.

05:22.332 --> 05:24.531
I like dwarfs.

05:24.532 --> 05:26.051
Me too. Who are you?

05:26.052 --> 05:28.011
I'm Marnie.

05:28.012 --> 05:30.691
And this baby of yours,
who's the dad?

05:30.692 --> 05:34.691
Depends if it's white, or black,
or Chinese or...French.

05:35.292 --> 05:36.811
Those brown babies are very cute.

05:36.812 --> 05:39.411
And I like a Chinese baby
as much as the next man.

05:39.412 --> 05:41.371
Me too.

05:41.372 --> 05:43.771
Whoever the dad is, he's not around.

05:43.772 --> 05:45.331
So you're all alone in the world...

05:45.332 --> 05:47.611
apart from the living organism
growing inside you?

05:47.612 --> 05:51.611
Looks that way.

05:51.732 --> 05:53.451
We should probably go for a drink.

05:53.452 --> 05:55.051
Swap some funny stories.

05:55.052 --> 05:57.411
See if we have
similar tastes and interests.

05:57.412 --> 06:00.731
Overcome some emotional hurdles.
And have a few huge rows.

06:00.732 --> 06:03.291
What did you do, you stupid prick?!

06:03.292 --> 06:04.411
I'm sorry, baby,

06:04.412 --> 06:07.331
I didn't know we were exclusive -
and she had massive tits.

06:07.332 --> 06:08.531
It'll never happen again.

06:08.532 --> 06:10.211
We make up, and before you know what

06:10.212 --> 06:12.371
I've trapped you
in a serious relationship.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.411
That would be
the conventional way to do it.

06:14.412 --> 06:16.891
There's just one problem.

06:16.892 --> 06:18.891
I can't drink.

06:18.892 --> 06:21.291
So...I guess we should
skip all that other stuff

06:21.292 --> 06:25.291
and get straight down
to the shagging.

06:48.092 --> 06:50.051
I don't want to poke
the baby in the eye.

06:50.052 --> 06:52.131
Just...do it gently.

06:52.132 --> 06:56.131
Fuck me, Santa.

07:15.372 --> 07:19.371
I'm here about my power.

07:42.252 --> 07:46.251
Take a seat.

07:48.452 --> 07:51.851
So what can you do?

07:51.852 --> 07:54.251
Er...

07:54.252 --> 07:57.011
Anyone who touches me,

07:57.012 --> 07:58.491
they want to shag me.

07:58.492 --> 08:02.491
super-horny or something.

08:02.492 --> 08:05.931
I can see how that
would be a problem.

08:05.932 --> 08:09.931
How much do you want for it?

08:10.212 --> 08:14.211
I don't want anything,
I...just want it gone.

08:14.412 --> 08:18.411
Can you do that?

08:19.292 --> 08:23.291
That's why I'm here.

08:24.092 --> 08:26.211
You won't use it on anyone, will you?

08:26.212 --> 08:29.531
I can't use the powers
while I'm holding them.

08:29.532 --> 08:31.051
What will you do with it, then?

08:31.052 --> 08:35.051
That's not your problem.

08:36.172 --> 08:38.251
Look...

08:38.251 --> 08:42.251
..I can give you your life back.

08:42.652 --> 08:46.651
That's what you want, right? >

08:47.892 --> 08:51.891
Give me your hand.

09:58.132 --> 10:02.131
It's all there.

10:27.412 --> 10:31.451
Hi.
Hi.

10:31.452 --> 10:33.171
I don't want you to freak out...

10:33.172 --> 10:36.651
Why would I...

10:36.652 --> 10:40.451
There's this guy. I went to see him.
He took my power.

10:40.452 --> 10:42.211
How?

10:42.212 --> 10:45.131
He touched me. It's gone.

10:45.132 --> 10:47.011
What's he going to do with it?

10:47.012 --> 10:48.411
I don't know.

10:48.412 --> 10:52.411
Doesn't matter. It's gone.

10:53.092 --> 10:57.091
I want to be able to touch you.

10:59.892 --> 11:03.891
I want it to be like it was.

11:05.412 --> 11:09.411
We had great sex.

11:09.772 --> 11:13.771
I miss having sex with you.

11:15.052 --> 11:19.051
Kiss me.

11:20.052 --> 11:22.051
# ..when my baby

11:22.052 --> 11:26.051
# When my baby comes home

11:29.932 --> 11:33.051
# He said not to worry

11:33.052 --> 11:35.971
# Don't sit by the phone

11:35.972 --> 11:38.771
# Soon I'll be home, baby

11:38.772 --> 11:42.011
# You'll never be alone

11:42.012 --> 11:45.011
# I expect to see him

11:45.012 --> 11:47.371
# Sometime today

11:47.372 --> 11:50.251
# I know my baby

11:50.252 --> 11:53.491
# Is never going away... #

11:55.012 --> 11:58.451
Doesn't matter.

11:58.452 --> 12:00.811
Simon...

12:00.812 --> 12:04.811
..look at me.

12:05.972 --> 12:08.811
He was much better than me,
wasn't he?

12:08.812 --> 12:12.811
No... It was different.

12:16.892 --> 12:20.451
I hate thinking about
you being with him.

12:20.452 --> 12:22.691
It was you!

12:22.692 --> 12:26.171
You're the same person.

12:26.172 --> 12:30.171
Except he's much better than me,
isn't he?

12:36.692 --> 12:40.691
You'll always love him
more than you love me.

12:42.772 --> 12:46.771
Simon...

13:27.972 --> 13:31.971
How are you doing that? >

13:37.892 --> 13:41.491
I'm Jesus Christ...

13:41.492 --> 13:44.331
..and I have been reborn.

14:16.497 --> 14:19.016
I want to be there for you,
you and the baby.

14:19.017 --> 14:20.336
Have you got any money?

14:20.337 --> 14:22.376
I'm not being funny,
you look seriously poor.

14:22.377 --> 14:26.296
Maybe I'm a multimillionaire who just
chooses to live in the community centre.

14:26.297 --> 14:27.456
And are you?

14:27.457 --> 14:31.456
No. That would be ridiculous!

14:34.577 --> 14:38.576
40, 60...

14:38.977 --> 14:41.936
1.67. Oh!

14:41.937 --> 14:44.456
1.68.

14:44.457 --> 14:47.576
That's everything I have
in the entire world. Take it.

14:47.577 --> 14:50.256
I want you to have it.

14:50.257 --> 14:54.256
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

14:54.297 --> 14:58.296
Actually, can I just get
50p back for a Kit-Kat?

15:02.977 --> 15:04.376
Oh, Jesus!

15:04.377 --> 15:05.576
What's wrong?

15:05.577 --> 15:07.696
The baby's on my bladder.
I pissed myself.

15:07.697 --> 15:09.096
Oh. Don't worry about it.

15:09.097 --> 15:12.896
I've pissed and shit myself
more times than I can remember.

15:12.897 --> 15:16.896
Me too.

15:25.017 --> 15:27.576
I'll be right with you.
Hiya. You must be Barry?

15:27.577 --> 15:30.296
Nathan's told me so much about you.

15:34.857 --> 15:36.936
Phew!

15:36.937 --> 15:38.776
Who's she?

15:38.777 --> 15:40.256
He took her power.

15:40.257 --> 15:42.376
So how much did she get for it?

15:42.377 --> 15:44.896
Nothing.
She wanted to get rid of it.

15:44.897 --> 15:46.536
She can touch people.

15:46.537 --> 15:50.536
I can touch her.

15:51.657 --> 15:52.696
We had sex.

15:52.697 --> 15:56.696
Ah! So you finally get to
sample the goods, and they're...

15:58.377 --> 16:00.376
Not as advertised?

16:00.377 --> 16:04.176
Is she one of those girls with really
long pubes, down to her knees?

16:04.177 --> 16:05.016
No.

16:05.017 --> 16:06.816
No.
Has she got an extroverted vagina?

16:06.817 --> 16:09.296
Because they can fix that
in an operation, man!

16:09.297 --> 16:10.616
I was shit.

16:10.617 --> 16:12.016
Oh!

16:12.017 --> 16:15.696
So you're after some sex tips
from a far more experienced lover!

16:15.697 --> 16:16.896
Two words.

16:16.897 --> 16:18.816
Fisherman's Friend.

16:18.817 --> 16:21.096
Isn't that a cough sweet?

16:21.097 --> 16:24.616
You pop one of those bad boys in your
mouth and then you head due south

16:24.617 --> 16:26.896
and you pleasure her, orally.

16:26.897 --> 16:30.296
And it's the menthol.
She'll feel like her pussy's on fire.

16:30.297 --> 16:32.096
Huh?

16:32.097 --> 16:36.016
Ah, I always keep some on me,
just in case I'm required to perform.

16:36.017 --> 16:37.616
Go on.

16:37.617 --> 16:38.856
That's for you.

16:38.857 --> 16:42.856
I think that young lady is going
to have a very merry Christmas!

16:44.297 --> 16:46.096
I'll tell you something else, man,

16:46.097 --> 16:50.096
if the girl's pregnant,
it makes the baby kick like a nutter!

16:52.737 --> 16:56.736
See you, man.

17:03.817 --> 17:07.816
Hi.

17:15.977 --> 17:17.616
So, what have you got?

17:17.617 --> 17:19.496
Immortality.

17:19.497 --> 17:23.496
So that's off the A list.

17:25.537 --> 17:27.415
How much d'you want for it?

17:27.416 --> 17:29.696
I will not settle for a penny less...

17:29.697 --> 17:33.696
than one million pounds.

17:34.177 --> 17:38.176
# EARTHA KITT: Santa, Baby

17:43.257 --> 17:44.736
What's this?

17:44.737 --> 17:48.136
That's two grand,
for you and the baby.

17:48.137 --> 17:52.016
Yeah, it should've been more, but I
got really beaten down on the price.

17:52.017 --> 17:53.616
How did you get it?

17:53.617 --> 17:55.856
Did you suck off
some fat German tourist?

17:55.857 --> 17:59.856
No! No. I sold my immortality.

18:00.617 --> 18:01.976
What?

18:01.977 --> 18:05.976
It's a long and
totally ridiculous story.

18:06.057 --> 18:10.056
I am here to help you change your
life today, right now, this moment.

18:10.897 --> 18:13.736
I know what it's like
living on this estate.

18:13.737 --> 18:16.896
I know what it's like to feel
disappointment, to feel pain,

18:16.897 --> 18:18.736
to feel angry...
What's all this?

18:18.737 --> 18:21.096
Our Lord, Jesus Christ,
has risen again.

18:21.097 --> 18:22.176
Right.

18:22.177 --> 18:23.896
Good for him.

18:23.897 --> 18:26.536
- It's nice he's come back in time
for Christmas. - Yeah.

18:26.537 --> 18:30.216
I promise I will change your lives
forever, this day, this moment.

18:30.217 --> 18:32.856
Give us the money. Do it!

18:32.857 --> 18:35.776
I know what it's like to...

18:35.777 --> 18:39.496
Did no-one ever tell you
that stealing is a sin?

18:39.497 --> 18:42.256
Who are you?
I'm Jesus Christ.

18:42.257 --> 18:49.096
- Yeah? Well, I need to score, so you're
getting robbed. - I don't think so.

19:00.137 --> 19:04.136
It's another miracle!

19:04.377 --> 19:08.096
You need to do
some serious repenting.

19:08.097 --> 19:10.896
If you wish to enter
the Kingdom of Heaven,

19:10.897 --> 19:14.896
you must give generously, so that
we can spread the word of our Lord.

19:17.577 --> 19:21.576
Spread.

19:35.097 --> 19:37.896
It's so weird that I can do this.

19:37.897 --> 19:39.376
How does it feel?

19:39.377 --> 19:42.776
It's so nice not to have
to think about it anymore.

19:42.777 --> 19:44.616
Maybe we'd all be better off
without them.

19:44.617 --> 19:45.696
What're you saying?

19:45.697 --> 19:49.616
I'm saying this random teleporting
all over the place,

19:49.617 --> 19:51.256
it's a pain in the arse.

19:51.257 --> 19:53.616
What has any of us
actually achieved with our powers?

19:53.617 --> 19:55.256
Apart from saving all our lives?

19:55.257 --> 19:57.536
We wouldn't need saving
if it wasn't for the powers.

19:57.537 --> 19:59.496
We don't need to be caught up
in this bullshit.

19:59.497 --> 20:03.016
D'you think it's all right
to just flog our powers like that?

20:03.017 --> 20:05.536
I don't know if you've noticed, but
we're not exactly living the dream.

20:05.537 --> 20:08.336
You always hated hearing
what people thought about you.

20:08.337 --> 20:09.736
That's because most people
are two-faced dickheads.

20:09.737 --> 20:11.296
I think we should see this guy.

20:11.297 --> 20:15.296
See how much he offers us.

20:18.097 --> 20:22.096
Look, it's worth
having a conversation.

20:24.057 --> 20:28.056
All right.

20:37.657 --> 20:40.056
What're you doing here?

20:40.057 --> 20:42.136
I wanted to know what he was doing
with the powers. Why are you here?

20:42.137 --> 20:44.576
20 fucking grand!

20:44.577 --> 20:45.976
You sold your powers?

20:45.977 --> 20:46.976
Yeah, mate.

20:46.977 --> 20:50.176
Yeah, mate. You shouldn't be doing this.
We were given them for a reason.

20:50.177 --> 20:50.656
And what reason's that?

20:50.657 --> 20:53.496
- And what reason's that? - I'll give you
20,000 reasons for getting rid of 'em.

20:53.497 --> 20:54.816
It's like in Superman II,

20:54.817 --> 20:58.056
when Superman gives up his powers
so he could be with Lois Lane.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.536
And?

20:59.537 --> 21:01.056
General Zod took over the world!

21:01.057 --> 21:03.736
That's totally relevant,
except there ain't no General Zod,

21:03.737 --> 21:06.656
and that's 20,000.

21:06.657 --> 21:10.656
Later.

21:11.777 --> 21:14.056
I just want us
to be a normal couple.

21:14.057 --> 21:16.376
I don't think we ever can be.

21:16.377 --> 21:19.656
Yeah, but...
You don't need to be invisible.

21:19.657 --> 21:22.296
You're not that person anymore.

21:22.297 --> 21:25.376
You've moved on. We've all moved on.

21:25.377 --> 21:29.376
It's part of who I am.

21:30.337 --> 21:34.336
You told me we should do this.

21:34.577 --> 21:37.656
Are you from the future?

21:37.657 --> 21:39.256
I told you we should
give up our powers?

21:39.257 --> 21:40.456
Yeah.

21:40.457 --> 21:44.456
We're supposed to do this.

21:59.257 --> 22:03.256
Are you buying or selling?

22:22.938 --> 22:26.737
Coming to bed?

22:26.738 --> 22:30.337
This is part of the sex.
You just need some practice.

22:30.338 --> 22:33.777
It's how you get good.

22:33.778 --> 22:37.697
# Oh, happy day

22:37.698 --> 22:40.417
# Oh, happy day

22:40.418 --> 22:42.617
# Oh, happy day

22:42.618 --> 22:44.977
# When Jesus washed

22:44.978 --> 22:46.817
# When Jesus washed

22:46.818 --> 22:50.137
# Oh, when he washed

22:50.138 --> 22:51.297
# When he washed

22:51.298 --> 22:53.177
# When Jesus washed

22:53.178 --> 22:54.817
# When Jesus washed

22:54.818 --> 22:56.337
# He washed my sins away

22:56.338 --> 22:57.657
#Oh, happy day

22:57.658 --> 22:59.817
# Oh, happy day

22:59.818 --> 23:01.817
# Oh, happy day

23:01.818 --> 23:05.817
# When Jesus washed

23:06.018 --> 23:07.497
# When Jesus washed

23:07.498 --> 23:10.017
# Oh, when he washed

23:10.018 --> 23:12.017
# When Jesus washed

23:12.018 --> 23:13.617
# When Jesus washed

23:13.618 --> 23:15.217
# When Jesus washed

23:15.218 --> 23:17.177
# He washed my sins away

23:17.178 --> 23:18.457
# Oh, happy day

23:18.458 --> 23:20.057
# Oh, happy day

23:20.058 --> 23:21.177
# Oh, happy day

23:21.178 --> 23:22.337
# It's a happy day

23:22.338 --> 23:26.337
# He taught me how to watch

23:32.258 --> 23:35.817
# Fight and pray

23:35.818 --> 23:39.697
# Fight and pray

23:39.698 --> 23:43.697
# And he'll rejoice

23:44.898 --> 23:48.897
# In things we say

23:49.818 --> 23:51.777
# Things we say

23:51.778 --> 23:55.377
# Oh, happy day

23:55.378 --> 23:57.857
# Oh happy day

23:57.858 --> 23:59.857
# Oh, happy day

23:59.858 --> 24:01.657
# Oh, happy day

24:01.658 --> 24:03.177
# Oh, happy day

24:03.178 --> 24:05.617
# Oh, happy day

24:05.618 --> 24:08.577
# Oh, happy day

24:08.578 --> 24:12.537
# Oh, happy day, oh, happy day

24:12.538 --> 24:16.537
# Oh, happy day, oh, happy day

24:17.218 --> 24:20.057
# Oh, happy day, oh, oh, yeah

24:20.058 --> 24:23.697
# Oh, happy day, oh, happy day

24:23.698 --> 24:27.697
# Oh, happy day... #

24:35.458 --> 24:37.697
Jesus?

24:37.698 --> 24:41.697
Hi.

24:51.578 --> 24:55.577
Is that really the best you can do?

24:57.258 --> 24:59.417
I'll break it down for you.

24:59.418 --> 25:02.577
Do you want to go to heaven,

25:02.578 --> 25:06.537
or d'you want to burn in hell
for all eternity? Hm.

25:06.538 --> 25:07.897
That's all they had to give.

25:07.898 --> 25:11.897
If they won't give willingly,
you take it from them.

25:12.538 --> 25:16.537
You said robbing people was wrong.

25:17.778 --> 25:21.777
Now you're doing it for God, it's OK.

25:23.938 --> 25:27.937
Go forth unto the world,
and bring me some money!

25:49.418 --> 25:53.417
Chin chin! Here's to life.

26:00.698 --> 26:04.657
So now you're going travelling, suddenly
you're all cool about giving out free drinks?

26:04.658 --> 26:06.857
I am so looking forward to not
having to listen to your shit.

26:06.858 --> 26:10.857
I'll miss you, too.

26:15.938 --> 26:17.257
What?

26:17.258 --> 26:19.017
You look amazing.

26:19.018 --> 26:20.537
Do you think so?

26:20.538 --> 26:24.057
Yeah, well classy.

26:24.058 --> 26:25.977
The woman in the shop
thought I was shoplifting.

26:25.978 --> 26:28.457
Got my wad of cash out.
She looked proper sick.

26:28.458 --> 26:30.537
Should've seen her.

26:30.538 --> 26:33.537
Set me up.

26:33.538 --> 26:34.937
So where are you going first?

26:34.938 --> 26:37.577
Thailand. We fly to Bangkok,
then we hit the beaches.

26:37.578 --> 26:41.577
D'you think you might have a go
on one of those Thai lady boys?

26:41.738 --> 26:43.817
Yeah. I see that happening.

26:43.818 --> 26:46.937
You may not know until it's too late.
I didn't have a clue, man.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.337
Have you been to Thailand?

26:48.338 --> 26:51.257
No. I met this little fella
at a party on the estate.

26:51.258 --> 26:53.177
What, and you went with him?

26:53.178 --> 26:56.217
Let's just say,
I didn't not go with him.

26:56.218 --> 26:59.217
I was very drunk, and he had his cock
and balls taped into his arse crack.

26:59.218 --> 27:03.217
From where I was kneeling,
it looked like a bald little pussy.

27:05.258 --> 27:08.897
Can I get you something?
Empty the till and the safe!

27:08.898 --> 27:10.497
Yeah, good one, mate.

27:10.498 --> 27:14.017
What the fuck are you doing?!

27:14.018 --> 27:19.257
Just give us the money. Do it!
All right.

27:19.258 --> 27:21.017
And the safe.

27:21.018 --> 27:23.057
They don't trust me with
the keys to the safe.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.697
That's because you're always
giving people free drinks.

27:24.698 --> 27:26.777
Back off!
Move!

27:26.778 --> 27:30.777
Give us your money!
Give us your cash!

27:34.738 --> 27:35.737
Where's yours?

27:35.738 --> 27:38.097
I haven't got any.
I never have any. Ask anyone.

27:38.098 --> 27:39.217
Hand it over.

27:39.218 --> 27:40.497
Just give him the money!

27:40.498 --> 27:42.217
No. That's for Marnie and the baby!

27:42.218 --> 27:44.857
Do you think I'm joking?

27:44.858 --> 27:47.777
Actually,
I really couldn't give a fuck.

27:47.778 --> 27:49.457
Back off!

27:49.458 --> 27:51.777
Go ahead.

27:51.778 --> 27:55.417
Shoot me!

27:55.418 --> 27:57.817
I'm immortal!

27:57.818 --> 28:01.457
No, you're not.

28:01.458 --> 28:05.457
Nikki!

28:08.698 --> 28:12.697
Someone call an ambulance!

28:18.738 --> 28:21.817
Is she breathing?

28:21.818 --> 28:25.817
Nikki!

29:00.938 --> 29:04.937
I'm going to get my power back.
I'm going to turn back time.

29:06.778 --> 29:10.777
I'm going to save her.

29:11.738 --> 29:14.297
I knew there was
something up with that lad.

29:14.298 --> 29:18.297
If I'd had my power,
I could've stopped it.

29:21.058 --> 29:25.057
If I die, I won't be there
for Marnie and the baby.

29:33.098 --> 29:36.697
I can't go back to being like that.

29:36.698 --> 29:40.697
I'm sorry.

30:00.498 --> 30:02.457
I need my power back.

30:02.458 --> 30:04.657
That's not going to be possible.

30:04.658 --> 30:06.177
What're you talking about?

30:06.178 --> 30:07.377
I don't have it.

30:07.378 --> 30:08.417
What d'you mean, you don't have it?

30:08.418 --> 30:10.777
I sold it to an old Jewish guy.

30:10.778 --> 30:14.777
He said he wanted to
rewind time and kill Hitler.

30:15.098 --> 30:16.817
You've got to admire his ambition.

30:16.818 --> 30:19.057
My girlfriend's dead.
I need my power.

30:19.058 --> 30:20.777
C'mon, man!

30:20.778 --> 30:24.417
I'm sorry about your girlfriend,
but I can't help you.

30:24.418 --> 30:26.777
What about the rest of our powers?

30:26.778 --> 30:28.297
We're gonna need those back, too.

30:28.298 --> 30:30.817
They're still available, at a price.

30:30.818 --> 30:34.737
How much?

30:34.738 --> 30:38.257
Shall we say 40,000, each.

30:38.258 --> 30:40.537
You only paid us 20 grand!

30:40.538 --> 30:43.817
What, you got 20,000 for your power?

30:43.818 --> 30:45.377
Yeah. How much did you get?

30:45.378 --> 30:47.857
We don't need to get into that now.

30:47.858 --> 30:49.137
You robbed me, you bastard!

30:49.138 --> 30:52.017
You all agreed a price
you were happy to sell at.

30:52.018 --> 30:56.017
I didn't think it through,
so legally, it's still mine.

30:58.018 --> 31:02.017
You get me my power.

31:02.138 --> 31:06.137
It's not going to happen.

31:08.338 --> 31:12.017
You either get him his power back,
or I start kicking you in the balls.

31:12.018 --> 31:16.017
Yeah, I've seen her do it.
You won't enjoy it one little bit.

31:17.178 --> 31:21.177
I really wouldn't do
that if I were you.

31:23.258 --> 31:26.577
Him?
Are you for real?

31:26.578 --> 31:28.497
He couldn't fuck his way
out of a paper bag, mate.

31:28.498 --> 31:32.497
Look at him. He's got the body of a small,
malnourished, prepubescent child.

31:35.458 --> 31:38.377
Oh? Hey there, little fella...

31:38.378 --> 31:42.377
Argh!

31:48.898 --> 31:52.817
Open the fucking door!
Open the fuck...

31:52.818 --> 31:54.897
Open it!

31:54.898 --> 31:58.897
What're you gonna do?

32:03.498 --> 32:07.497
Argh. I think he broke a rib.

32:30.538 --> 32:32.577
Hi.

32:32.578 --> 32:36.217
Fuck off.

32:36.218 --> 32:38.617
That wasn't very friendly.

32:38.618 --> 32:40.857
What do you want?

32:40.858 --> 32:43.297
I just want to chat.
I'm Jesus.

32:43.298 --> 32:47.297
I know you. The guy who takes
the powers. You were there.

32:49.058 --> 32:52.897
You got me.

32:52.898 --> 32:54.217
You're very pretty.

32:54.218 --> 32:58.217
That's original.

32:58.258 --> 33:02.257
I want to fuck your brains out.

33:04.418 --> 33:08.417
Come on, let's go.

33:12.778 --> 33:16.457
Jesus?

33:16.458 --> 33:19.937
I, er... I shot someone.

33:19.938 --> 33:21.257
You did what?

33:21.258 --> 33:23.617
I didn't mean to.

33:23.618 --> 33:27.617
She's dead.

33:31.498 --> 33:35.497
You've got my power.

33:42.098 --> 33:44.137
She was just a girl.

33:44.138 --> 33:45.857
I killed her!

33:45.858 --> 33:49.857
Are you sorry?

33:50.378 --> 33:54.377
Then God forgives you.

33:54.778 --> 33:58.577
Seriously?
Just like that?

33:58.578 --> 34:01.697
Just like that.
Everything bad you've ever done.

34:01.698 --> 34:05.697
All the stealing,
drugs and masturbating.

34:09.737 --> 34:13.737
Don't worry about it.
You're forgiven!

34:18.338 --> 34:22.337
Off you go, then.

34:44.737 --> 34:48.737
Alisha? What is it? What happened?

34:48.777 --> 34:50.217
I lied to you.

34:50.217 --> 34:54.217
You never said we were
supposed to give up our powers.

34:56.978 --> 35:00.977
But I just wanted us to be normal.

35:02.018 --> 35:03.697
You shouldn't have done that.

35:03.698 --> 35:07.697
Sorry!

35:08.258 --> 35:12.257
We started this,
and now Nikki's dead.

35:12.738 --> 35:14.137
It's OK.

35:14.138 --> 35:18.137
No, it's not OK.

35:18.738 --> 35:21.937
What is it?

35:21.938 --> 35:25.697
There's a guy calling himself Jesus.

35:25.698 --> 35:29.697
He's got my power.
He used it on me.

35:29.858 --> 35:31.417
Did you...?

35:31.418 --> 35:35.417
No. I got away,

35:35.618 --> 35:38.257
but the boy who robbed the
bar, he was there, and...

35:38.258 --> 35:42.257
I think the Jesus guy
put him up to it.

35:44.938 --> 35:48.217
Where're you going?

35:48.218 --> 35:50.737
I'm going to kill Jesus.

35:50.738 --> 35:54.737
I'm coming with you.

36:06.248 --> 36:09.487
Ah! Everybody, this is Marnie.

36:09.488 --> 36:10.087
Hi.

36:10.088 --> 36:11.367
Hi.
These are my friends.

36:11.368 --> 36:12.487
I'm not your friend.

36:12.488 --> 36:13.647
She's lying.

36:13.648 --> 36:17.647
The guy who killed Nikki.
He was doing it for Jesus.

36:29.448 --> 36:31.047
Oh, what?

36:31.048 --> 36:33.047
Is that the guy?

36:33.048 --> 36:34.287
Can I help you?

36:34.288 --> 36:37.807
You can't go around pretending
to be Jesus. What's God gonna say?

36:37.808 --> 36:39.767
You haven't even got a beard!

36:39.768 --> 36:41.807
Hey! I gave my life to him.

36:41.808 --> 36:44.687
I went without money and sex.
What a joke!

36:44.688 --> 36:47.527
I preached and prayed,
and no-one gave a shit.

36:47.528 --> 36:49.887
You do a few miracles, everyone
thinks you're the messiah.

36:49.888 --> 36:51.847
Have you seen that lot out there?

36:51.848 --> 36:55.287
I've given their lives....meaning.

36:55.288 --> 36:56.807
I'm sorry. Would you mind

36:56.808 --> 36:58.767
getting her to stop?
That's very distracting.

36:58.768 --> 37:00.447
One of your followers
killed my girlfriend...

37:00.448 --> 37:02.327
You're exploiting the vulnerable.

37:02.328 --> 37:04.927
You're taking money off pupils.
You're sexually assaulting girls.

37:04.928 --> 37:07.687
Hey.
That's the Catholic Church for you.

37:07.688 --> 37:09.927
He's got a point.
When I was growing up in Ireland,

37:09.928 --> 37:12.607
if the priests weren't fiddling with
you, you were one of the ugly kids.

37:12.608 --> 37:16.607
I'm going to finish you.

37:35.968 --> 37:38.287
We may have done sod all with our
powers, but we never abused them.

37:38.288 --> 37:40.847
We never raped or murdered anyone.

37:40.848 --> 37:43.367
She raped me, and we
killed loads of people.

37:43.368 --> 37:45.247
OK. But we're the good guys.

37:45.248 --> 37:47.767
Every time we get anywhere near him,
he'll just fuck off somewhere else.

37:47.768 --> 37:50.407
We need our powers.
We can use this to buy them back.

37:50.408 --> 37:52.327
And then we're kicking
the shit out of Jesus!

37:52.328 --> 37:56.327
He's not Jesus, all right?

37:57.408 --> 37:59.807
This way.

37:59.808 --> 38:01.527
Should you be carrying
something heavy like this?

38:01.528 --> 38:05.527
I'm fine.

38:06.008 --> 38:07.207
I think that belongs to me.

38:07.208 --> 38:09.447
Come and get it
if you fucking want it.

38:09.448 --> 38:11.327
Back this way, back this way.

38:11.328 --> 38:13.607
If the mountain won't come
to Mohammed...

38:13.608 --> 38:17.607
Now he's starting on the Muslims!

38:44.648 --> 38:48.647
Ah, shit! We've killed Jesus!

38:52.288 --> 38:53.967
Just in case he really is Jesus.

38:53.968 --> 38:56.687
Our Lord has sacrificed himself,
again.

38:56.688 --> 39:00.207
He's not Jesus! He's just a
dickhead with a few super powers.

39:00.208 --> 39:02.367
Super powers?

39:02.368 --> 39:06.367
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

39:06.408 --> 39:08.007
Ah! Did you piss yourself again?

39:08.008 --> 39:12.007
My waters have broken.
The baby's coming... Ow!

39:15.808 --> 39:18.327
What do we do?

39:18.328 --> 39:20.247
Where's the fucking ambulance, mate?

39:20.248 --> 39:22.207
I've called it two times!

39:26.728 --> 39:29.607
You've got
to be fucking kidding me.

39:29.608 --> 39:31.927
Does anyone know anything about
delivering babies,

39:31.928 --> 39:33.487
because I think this is happening
right now...

39:33.488 --> 39:34.247
Hot towels!

39:34.248 --> 39:36.167
Hot towels!
Right!

39:36.168 --> 39:37.647
We haven't got any.

39:37.648 --> 39:38.687
Oh, you're a big fucking help(!)

39:38.688 --> 39:40.167
Where's the ambulance?

39:40.168 --> 39:41.447
- Oh, you're a big fucking help(!)
Where's the ambulance? - It's on its way!

39:41.448 --> 39:42.807
How close is it
to actually coming out?

39:42.808 --> 39:43.807
I don't know.
...How does it feel, baby?

39:43.808 --> 39:46.127
It feels like my cunt's
being ripped apart!

39:46.128 --> 39:48.767
I'm no expert,
but that sounds normal.

39:48.768 --> 39:52.767
Right.
I'm going down for a quick peak.

39:57.768 --> 40:01.167
There's a little baby
coming out of your twat!

40:01.168 --> 40:03.367
Me and Marnie talked about it,

40:03.368 --> 40:05.327
and we want all of you
to be the baby's godparents.

40:05.328 --> 40:06.887
She doesn't even know us.

40:06.888 --> 40:09.527
She hasn't got any other friends,
and neither have I.

40:09.528 --> 40:12.967
I told her there's no-one in the
world I trust more than you guys.

40:12.968 --> 40:14.207
You said that about us?

40:14.208 --> 40:17.127
Well, no, not really.
So what d'you say?

40:17.128 --> 40:19.847
Will you please shut the fuck up?!

40:19.848 --> 40:23.847
Sorry. Sorry.
Sorry, baby. Come on. Just push.

40:35.888 --> 40:39.887
Hello!

40:39.888 --> 40:43.887
He looks like me.

40:52.248 --> 40:55.367
Hey, there, little fella.

40:55.368 --> 40:57.367
It's OK. Daddy's here.

40:57.368 --> 41:01.367
# Little donkey, little donkey

41:03.328 --> 41:07.327
# On the dusky road

41:08.448 --> 41:12.447
# Gotta keep on plodding onwards

41:13.848 --> 41:17.847
# With your precious load

41:18.968 --> 41:22.967
# Been a long time, little donkey

41:24.008 --> 41:28.007
# Through the winter's night

41:28.688 --> 41:32.687
# Don't give up now, little donkey

41:33.928 --> 41:37.927
# Bethlehem's in sight

41:38.928 --> 41:42.927
# Ring out the bells tonight

41:44.408 --> 41:48.407
# Bethlehem, Bethlehem

41:49.648 --> 41:53.647
# Follow the star tonight

41:55.288 --> 41:59.287
# Bethlehem, Bethlehem. #

42:03.968 --> 42:06.007
You've seriously lost your cool.

42:06.008 --> 42:10.007
Oh, shut up. It's Christmas.

42:13.968 --> 42:17.967
Sorry, Jesus.

42:21.088 --> 42:23.687
I think I'm having another!
I think I'm having twins!

42:23.688 --> 42:26.407
What?! Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

42:26.408 --> 42:27.127
What is it?

42:27.128 --> 42:28.367
What is it?
You're giving birth to an alien!

42:28.368 --> 42:32.367
Get it out, get it out!

42:43.328 --> 42:47.327
It's the afterbirth, you dickhead!

43:01.488 --> 43:03.327
Anyway, so...

43:03.328 --> 43:07.327
happy Christmas, one and all.

43:33.648 --> 43:35.087
That is a fucking horrible jumper.

43:35.088 --> 43:39.087
Shut up. It was a Christmas present
from Marnie. That's very rude.

43:44.248 --> 43:46.847
Is there any reason why have
to have the same powers as before?

43:46.848 --> 43:49.927
Mine died with that Jesus guy.

43:49.928 --> 43:53.927
He said if we've got the money,
we can take our pick.

44:05.608 --> 44:09.607
OK.

44:13.488 --> 44:17.487
So who's first?

44:18.088 --> 44:22.087
You're all such pussies! I'll do it.
