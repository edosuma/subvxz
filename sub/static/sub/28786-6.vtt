00:11.620 --> 00:13.758
- Oh, God.
Tarps.

00:13.827 --> 00:15.137
Are you, uh,

00:15.206 --> 00:17.689
are you having another
one of your special parties?

00:17.758 --> 00:20.482
- No, I am going to
paint the ceiling

00:20.551 --> 00:22.137
like the Sistine Chapel.

00:22.206 --> 00:23.586
Suspended.

00:23.655 --> 00:24.965
- Ooh, hot!

00:25.034 --> 00:27.241
- Ugh, you know what?
I'm not feeling so hot today.

00:27.310 --> 00:30.517
I waited ten minutes last night
to get a drink at Cubby Hole.

00:30.586 --> 00:32.137
- Well, that doesn't
seem so bad.

00:32.206 --> 00:35.275
- Liza, the bartenders used to
fight over who would serve me.

00:35.344 --> 00:37.275
Not argue, fight.

00:37.344 --> 00:39.344
I'm telling you,
I'm losing my mojo.

00:39.413 --> 00:40.724
- Come on, I heard
someone sneaking out

00:40.793 --> 00:42.379
of your room last night.
- That was me

00:42.448 --> 00:44.310
sneaking into the fridge.
- Oh.

00:44.379 --> 00:45.655
- Is Charles still here?

00:45.724 --> 00:47.310
- Uh, no.
He's not here.

00:47.379 --> 00:48.827
We are not in a good place.

00:48.896 --> 00:51.206
It's the whole corporate
competition thing.

00:51.275 --> 00:53.275
- Wait, that is
still happening?

00:53.344 --> 00:54.413
Oh, my God.

00:54.482 --> 00:56.517
It must be driving
Kelsey insane.

00:56.586 --> 00:58.103
It is.

00:58.172 --> 00:59.586
It's driving me insane.

00:59.655 --> 01:01.103
But apparently for Charles,

01:01.172 --> 01:03.758
it's a win-win, 'cause
he owns both companies.

01:03.827 --> 01:05.724
- Well, if he owns
both companies,

01:05.793 --> 01:07.689
why not just merge them,
right?

01:07.758 --> 01:10.827
- I don't think Kelsey
or Charles would go for that.

01:10.896 --> 01:12.689
How would I convince
either of them?

01:12.758 --> 01:15.413
- Just say that you'll
all be working together again.

01:15.482 --> 01:17.482
Charles still gets
all the profits.

01:17.551 --> 01:19.862

- After the success of
my intermittent fasting book,

01:35.103 --> 01:36.344
"Think Fast,"

01:36.413 --> 01:37.551
I'm focused on a new biohack

01:37.620 --> 01:40.103
to achieve self-actualization.

01:40.172 --> 01:43.413
Diana, what do you do when
your phone stops working?

01:43.482 --> 01:45.758
- Send Liza to the Genius Bar.

01:45.827 --> 01:47.482
- Okay. So, Liza,

01:47.551 --> 01:49.655
what advice
do they usually give you?

01:49.724 --> 01:51.413
- Uh, turn it off
and turn it back on.

01:51.482 --> 01:53.103
- Exactly. Reset.

01:53.172 --> 01:57.827
Which brings me to
my new book: "Microdosing."

01:57.896 --> 02:00.068
- And, uh, what is that?

02:00.137 --> 02:02.827
- Microdosing is ingesting
a small amount of a substance.

02:02.896 --> 02:04.068
Yes, illicit.

02:04.137 --> 02:06.448
It improves energy levels,
creativity,

02:06.517 --> 02:08.862
a general sense
of well-being.

02:08.931 --> 02:12.068
- How, uh, illicit
are we talking?

02:12.137 --> 02:17.482
- LSD, MDMA, Psilocybin,
commonly known as Mushrooms.

02:17.551 --> 02:19.551
- Isn't promoting drug use
a little dicey?

02:19.620 --> 02:21.379
I mean,
from a legal standpoint?

02:21.448 --> 02:22.655
- You have to think of these
substances

02:22.724 --> 02:24.275
as medicine for your mind.

02:24.344 --> 02:26.931
Microdosing can silence fears.
It can push aside ego.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.551
It can expand
our consciousness.

02:29.620 --> 02:31.482
I'm hosting
a medically-supervised retreat

02:31.551 --> 02:32.758
upstate this weekend.

02:32.827 --> 02:35.000
You can come see for yourself.

02:35.068 --> 02:37.241
- Me?
- Whoever's gonna edit my book

02:37.310 --> 02:38.758
has to be invested.

02:38.827 --> 02:41.344
They have to experience
microdosing firsthand.

02:41.413 --> 02:43.310
If you're not open to that...

02:43.379 --> 02:44.862
- No, I'm open. I'm open.

02:44.931 --> 02:46.206
I'm wide open.

02:46.275 --> 02:48.586
Uh, I've done Molly.

02:48.655 --> 02:50.655
Uh, and--I'm not bragging.

02:50.724 --> 02:52.379
I'm just saying that I would--

02:52.448 --> 02:54.793
yeah, I will see you there.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.551
- That book's gonna make
a lot of noise.

02:57.620 --> 02:59.310
I'm really glad you're up
for that retreat.

02:59.379 --> 03:01.137
- It's micro, right?

03:01.206 --> 03:02.551
- Totally micro.

03:02.620 --> 03:04.172
But you just have
to promise me one thing.

03:04.241 --> 03:05.482
- Sure.

03:05.551 --> 03:07.103
- You're gonna bring me
back samples.

03:07.172 --> 03:09.344
- Ladies, we have some voice
auditions to attend

03:09.413 --> 03:10.827
for Bronwyn Madigan's
Audible book.

03:10.896 --> 03:12.379
- Ooh, exciting!

03:12.448 --> 03:14.931
- It's Boomer Erotica, Liza.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.758
- Hmm.

03:16.827 --> 03:18.827
- "Cathy slid into the bathtub.

03:18.896 --> 03:21.310
"Noticing that Frank was
as hard as the titanium

03:21.379 --> 03:22.862
"in his hip, she said,

03:22.931 --> 03:25.206
'Rub-a-dub-dub, who's
the big boy in this tub?'"

03:25.275 --> 03:29.241
- "Rub-a-dub-dub, who is
the big boy in this tub?"

03:29.310 --> 03:31.206
- Rub-a-dub-dub,

03:31.275 --> 03:34.482
who's the big boy
in this tub?

03:34.551 --> 03:36.517
- Thank you for your time.

03:38.827 --> 03:40.931
- No one popped for me.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.482
It's like they're
not understanding Cathy.

03:43.551 --> 03:45.068
- I mean, what's not to get?

03:45.137 --> 03:46.793
"Kathy slid into the bathtub.

03:46.862 --> 03:48.655
"Noticing that Frank was

03:48.724 --> 03:50.655
"in his hip, she said,

03:50.724 --> 03:53.896
'Rub-a-dub-dub, who's
the big boy in this tub?'"

03:53.965 --> 03:55.620
- That I liked.

03:55.689 --> 03:57.517
- I mean, it's not hard.
What's the problem?

03:57.586 --> 03:59.758
- The problem is
you didn't audition.

03:59.827 --> 04:02.931
- Yeah, Diana, you should
totally be reading this.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.448
- Well, I have to agree with
my publisher.

04:07.517 --> 04:10.689
Diana Trout,
will you voice my book?

04:12.137 --> 04:13.586
- I think we found
our Seasoned Slut!

04:13.655 --> 04:16.448
- Stop.
- Sorry.

04:21.551 --> 04:23.793
Hey, working late?

04:23.862 --> 04:25.793
Always.

04:25.862 --> 04:27.586
- Well, do you need anything
before I go?

04:27.655 --> 04:29.448
We've got drinks at 8:00.

04:29.517 --> 04:31.724
- Mmm, Charles.

04:31.793 --> 04:33.931
- He's not the enemy, Kelsey.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.758
- I just--I hate
competing against him.

04:38.965 --> 04:41.448
- Maybe there's a way
we don't have to.

04:43.034 --> 04:44.620
I got to go.

04:46.206 --> 04:49.482
- ♪ Feel I,
should I let it go ♪

04:49.551 --> 04:51.620

04:51.689 --> 04:53.689
- Bing, bang, boom.
Merger.

04:53.758 --> 04:56.655
Millennial and Mercury
are one company.

04:56.724 --> 04:58.724
Your imprint stays the same,
so does ours,

04:58.793 --> 05:00.551
we all just work under one roof

05:00.620 --> 05:02.724
and take away the competition.

05:02.793 --> 05:04.482
You come out on top!

05:04.551 --> 05:07.896
- It's a great idea.

05:07.965 --> 05:09.517
In spirit.

05:09.586 --> 05:11.655
Mercury has
no cash flow yet.

05:11.724 --> 05:14.034
Its valuation is
purely speculative.

05:14.103 --> 05:17.724
The board would never
agree to a merger.

05:17.793 --> 05:19.448
- I just--I wish
there was a way

05:19.517 --> 05:22.275
that we could work together.

05:22.344 --> 05:24.275
- Come work at Mercury.

05:24.344 --> 05:25.344
- Ah, very funny.

05:25.413 --> 05:27.620
- I'm serious.

05:27.689 --> 05:28.896
- You are serious.

05:28.965 --> 05:32.448
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

05:32.517 --> 05:34.172
- I can't just leave Kelsey.

05:34.241 --> 05:36.482
- We would have to find you
a very, very competent editor

05:36.551 --> 05:39.620
to replace you at Millennial,
but that's not impossible.

05:39.689 --> 05:41.758
- But we're friends.
We're very close friends.

05:41.827 --> 05:44.172
You know that.
- Yes, and if you are friends,

05:44.241 --> 05:45.896
then she will understand.

05:45.965 --> 05:48.586
- Not if I leave her for you.

05:48.655 --> 05:52.379
- I left my company
to be with you.

05:52.448 --> 05:54.724
How can there even
be a choice?

05:54.793 --> 05:57.931
- You're kind of
making it a choice.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.586
I'm trying to bring
us all together.

06:00.655 --> 06:02.551
- Thank you.
Why don't we--

06:02.620 --> 06:05.068
why don't we
talk about this at home?

06:06.275 --> 06:07.793
- I have to pack.

06:07.862 --> 06:09.551
I'm going upstate tomorrow
for the night.

06:09.620 --> 06:13.413
- The microdosing retreat?
- You're going to that?

06:13.482 --> 06:15.206
- Yeah.
Why wouldn't I be?

06:15.275 --> 06:17.344
It's gonna be the hottest
nonfiction book of the year.

06:17.413 --> 06:19.448
- Millennial needs that book.
- So does Mercury.

06:21.344 --> 06:23.517
- Can I at least give you
a ride home?

06:23.586 --> 06:24.862
- Nope.
I'm good.

06:24.931 --> 06:27.137
See you tomorrow.

06:36.241 --> 06:38.379
- We have you in room three,
Ms. Miller.

06:38.448 --> 06:39.793
Let me just grab your keys,

06:39.862 --> 06:41.241
and I'll show you to your room.
- Okay.

06:43.482 --> 06:46.172
- You beat me.

06:46.241 --> 06:47.793
- For once, huh?

06:47.862 --> 06:49.413
- How was the train?

06:49.482 --> 06:50.758
- Uh, I got the quiet car.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.034
- Can we please just
call a truce?

06:53.103 --> 06:55.724
Maybe we can start
by sharing a room?

06:55.793 --> 06:56.965
- Are we still competing
for this book?

06:57.034 --> 06:59.103
- Yes.
- Then no.

07:01.206 --> 07:02.413
- Checking in?

07:02.482 --> 07:05.689
Tomorrow we wake,
meet in the great hall,

07:05.758 --> 07:07.517
and start the journey.

07:07.586 --> 07:09.034
- Oh!

07:09.103 --> 07:11.482
- In order to prep
your stomachs and psyches,

07:11.551 --> 07:13.206
here is an amuse-bouche.

07:13.275 --> 07:15.000
- Oh, wow.

07:17.517 --> 07:19.034
Uh, is this our dose?

07:19.103 --> 07:21.896
- It's a nanodose.
It's very mild.

07:21.965 --> 07:23.896
It's more to test out
how your system will react

07:23.965 --> 07:25.482
to the microdose tomorrow.

07:25.551 --> 07:26.827
- Oh.

07:26.896 --> 07:30.034
Uh, have you ever done
drugs before?

07:30.103 --> 07:32.827
- Uh, we were more
of a drinking family.

07:32.896 --> 07:35.724
- Oh, alcohol is so bad
for your system.

07:35.793 --> 07:39.103
- And LSD is healthy?

07:39.172 --> 07:41.620
- Legally, we can't say
it's LSD.

07:41.689 --> 07:43.586
- But it is LSD.

07:43.655 --> 07:47.517
- Legally, I can neither
confirm nor deny.

07:49.103 --> 07:50.931
- So what do you call it?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.965
- Not LSD.

07:54.034 --> 07:56.344
- Oh!

07:56.413 --> 07:58.448
- Your rooms.

07:58.517 --> 08:01.586
By the way, if you have
any questions, just call me.

08:01.655 --> 08:02.931
I'm literally a doctor.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.482
- Oh, uh, awesome.

08:06.344 --> 08:07.793
Bye.

08:10.689 --> 08:12.586
- Josh?

08:12.655 --> 08:14.310
Oh, my God.
Hi!

08:14.379 --> 08:16.068
What are you doing here?

08:16.137 --> 08:18.000
- I--I've known Travis
forever.

08:18.068 --> 08:21.482
He, uh, he told me there's
some venture capitalists here

08:21.551 --> 08:23.379
that he thinks I should meet.

08:23.448 --> 08:24.758
- Ab--about what?

08:24.827 --> 08:26.931
- He, uh, he thinks I should
franchise Inkburg.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.517
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:28.586 --> 08:32.206
I got a little girl and
a littler bank account, so...

08:33.724 --> 08:35.034
Uh, but, I mean,
the real question is

08:35.103 --> 08:36.965
what are you two doing
at a psychedelics retreat?

08:37.034 --> 08:40.241
- Uh, um, we're both trying
to land Travis's book.

08:40.310 --> 08:41.655
Separately.

08:41.724 --> 08:43.689
- Ah!
Sounds complicated.

08:43.758 --> 08:44.896
But fun?

08:44.965 --> 08:47.689
- Mm.
- Huh?

08:47.758 --> 08:51.896
- Well, I'm, uh, going to get
into whatever's in this can.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.379
Definitely not LSD.

08:54.448 --> 08:55.724
- Definitely not.

08:55.793 --> 08:58.448
- Bye.

08:58.517 --> 08:59.827
- Um...

08:59.896 --> 09:02.206
- Well, this should
be interesting.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.965
- Yeah.

09:04.034 --> 09:05.724
Should we do this?

09:09.379 --> 09:11.241
Cheers.

09:11.310 --> 09:12.758
- Cheers.

09:43.379 --> 09:45.068
- Yeah?
Great.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.379
- Oh, hi.

09:49.448 --> 09:52.413
- Oh, hello, Zane.
Uh, we're not quite done here.

09:52.482 --> 09:54.896
- I think we're actually
all out of time for today.

09:54.965 --> 09:56.620
- Yeah?
I thought I could maybe

09:56.689 --> 09:58.034
hit nipple a little harder.

09:58.103 --> 10:00.655
- Nah.
- Oh, okay. Great.

10:00.724 --> 10:02.517
Throbbing nipple.
Yeah.

10:02.586 --> 10:04.551
- You remember Audrey Colbert.

10:04.620 --> 10:06.034
- Of course.
- How you doing?

10:06.103 --> 10:07.620
- She's going to be voicing
her memoir.

10:07.689 --> 10:10.034
- Oh, well,
best of luck to you.

10:12.275 --> 10:14.000
- Don't you want to hear
a little?

10:14.068 --> 10:16.137
- Of the book
you stole from me?

10:16.206 --> 10:19.103
- Outbid, not stole.
- Right, stealing's a crime.

10:19.172 --> 10:22.000
You would never promote
anything like that.

10:29.448 --> 10:31.068
- Okay.

10:31.137 --> 10:32.655
"It was unlike any night

10:32.724 --> 10:35.827
"I've spent in Manhattan.
I was dressed to the nines,

10:35.896 --> 10:38.000
staring at my reflection in the
bathroom at the Four Seasons."

10:38.068 --> 10:40.620
- Uh, what do you think?
-  I mean,

10:40.689 --> 10:42.724
she's too
matter-of-fact.

10:42.793 --> 10:44.758
liked zoned out,
callous.

10:44.827 --> 10:47.275
- So, um, guilty.
- Yeah.

10:47.344 --> 10:51.275
- "I have no idea how it
happened, but they were dead."

10:51.344 --> 10:53.586
- Okay, that was great.
Good start.

10:53.655 --> 10:57.827
Um, but let's try one more with
a little bit more feeling.

10:57.896 --> 11:00.793
- Okay.
Let me try that.

11:03.103 --> 11:06.034
"I thought to myself,

11:06.103 --> 11:08.000
"am I really doing this?

11:08.068 --> 11:10.068
"Am I going to have
a three-way

11:10.137 --> 11:11.931
"with a married couple?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.172
"I took a deep breath,
opened the door,

11:14.241 --> 11:16.517
then I saw it!"

11:17.793 --> 11:21.344
"There was blood everywhere!

11:21.413 --> 11:24.413
I have no idea how it happened,
but they were dead!"

11:30.448 --> 11:32.655
That's how I did it
for the jury.

11:32.724 --> 11:34.758
Was that better?

11:34.827 --> 11:36.931
- That's great.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.758
- She's terrifying.
She's totally guilty.

11:39.827 --> 11:41.689
My God,
she's a psychopath.

11:41.758 --> 11:43.827
- You know, I gotta admit,
I'm a little scared of her.

11:43.896 --> 11:45.793
She's hot but...scary.

11:45.862 --> 11:47.793
- Your mic is open.

11:47.862 --> 11:51.413
But great to know
how you really feel.

11:53.172 --> 11:55.068
- W--

12:04.206 --> 12:07.000
-  Okay--now, that
was some crazy shit back there.

12:07.068 --> 12:09.793
I really enjoyed teaming up
with you again.

12:09.862 --> 12:11.172
We should do it long-term.

12:11.241 --> 12:13.896
If a spot at Millennial
opens up.

12:13.965 --> 12:15.517
- If you're trying to
tell me

12:15.586 --> 12:18.068
that Charles offered Liza
at job at Mercury...

12:18.137 --> 12:19.793
I know.
She told me.

12:19.862 --> 12:21.586
And she's staying
where she is.

12:21.655 --> 12:23.586
- Yeah, but for how long?

12:23.655 --> 12:26.068
Face it, Peters, Liza
and Charles won't stay apart.

12:26.137 --> 12:28.724
They're gonna work together.
It's inevitable.

12:28.793 --> 12:32.034
And where does that leave us?
- I don't know.

12:32.103 --> 12:35.448
But you and me--
we're a mess.

12:35.517 --> 12:38.206
- Hey, you're way more
of a mess than me.

12:38.275 --> 12:41.413
- Oh, um...I'm not the one
with stains on my tie.

12:42.103 --> 12:44.034
Boop!

12:44.103 --> 12:46.482
Can't believe I fell
for that.

12:55.655 --> 12:58.862
- This thing that's keeping us
apart is killing me.

13:03.344 --> 13:09.275
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:09.344 --> 13:11.000
We shouldn't be doing this.

13:11.068 --> 13:14.689
- Why not?
I came to apologize.

13:16.172 --> 13:18.827
- Uh, yes, you did, and...

13:18.896 --> 13:22.241
I let you in,
and I accept your apology.

13:23.068 --> 13:25.448
- I didn't take my dose.
Did you?

13:27.310 --> 13:28.551
Ah.

13:28.620 --> 13:30.275
That explains it.
You were...

13:30.344 --> 13:32.586
kind of a different
person there.

13:34.206 --> 13:37.413
- Yeah. You were kind of
a different person too.

13:43.310 --> 13:47.758
- Welcome to my retreat,
away from the ordinary.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.482
We wanna open your minds.

13:50.551 --> 13:52.689
It's one thing to read about
microdosing.

13:52.758 --> 13:55.379
It's another to experience it.

13:55.448 --> 13:58.379
And although your doses
have been carefully calibrated,

13:58.448 --> 14:00.896
everyone metabolizes
the chemicals differently,

14:00.965 --> 14:03.448
so if you have any reaction,

14:03.517 --> 14:07.172
please, go see one of
the doctors who welcomed you,

14:07.241 --> 14:09.689
or see the nurse Maureen
in the lobby.

Hey, guys.

You havin' fun yet?

14:41.172 --> 14:42.620
Uh...

14:42.689 --> 14:44.482
learning a lot, for sure.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.827
- That's a neat trick.

14:46.896 --> 14:49.379
What trick?

14:49.448 --> 14:52.379
-  Are you
seeing tricky things, Liza?

14:55.862 --> 14:57.413
- Nev--never mind me.

14:57.482 --> 15:00.413
I'm just--I'm just

15:00.482 --> 15:03.655
Oh, that's right.

15:03.724 --> 15:05.620
You're a drug super-taster.

15:05.689 --> 15:07.068
- I am?

15:07.137 --> 15:10.517
- Yeah! Remember
the lollipot in Jersey?

15:10.586 --> 15:12.310
What's a lollipot?

15:12.379 --> 15:14.448
-  It's
a weird story from the past.

15:14.517 --> 15:16.965
- You know, I'm gonna--
I'm gonna go see the nurse.

15:17.034 --> 15:18.172
I'll go with you.

15:18.241 --> 15:19.275
I'll go with you.

15:19.344 --> 15:20.448
- We'll go with you.

15:20.517 --> 15:21.931
- No.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.068
No.

15:24.137 --> 15:25.793
Don't...just...

15:25.862 --> 15:28.517
stay.

15:28.586 --> 15:31.172
Just...you stay.

15:31.241 --> 15:34.655
Okay...

15:45.586 --> 15:47.275
- Oh. Okay.

15:48.862 --> 15:51.137
Hi.
- Hi.

15:51.206 --> 15:53.172
- I'm feeling a little weird.

15:53.241 --> 15:55.137
Are you Nurse Maureen?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.896
Travis Jason
said to come find you

15:57.965 --> 16:00.068
if I was having any issues,

16:00.137 --> 16:02.965
and I am definitely
having some issues.

16:03.034 --> 16:05.551
- This is a safe space.

16:05.620 --> 16:07.551
- Help!

16:07.620 --> 16:09.172
Oh! Wait.

16:09.241 --> 16:11.896
Wait--

16:11.965 --> 16:14.517
Hey! You!

16:14.586 --> 16:15.862
Hey, you! Help!

16:15.931 --> 16:18.448
Oh!

16:18.517 --> 16:20.931
Hi! Call 911!

16:24.793 --> 16:27.517
Really?

16:27.586 --> 16:29.517
Oh, God!

16:29.586 --> 16:32.413
Help!

16:39.275 --> 16:40.689
Okay.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.172
Aah!

16:49.241 --> 16:51.689
Oh.
Whew.

16:52.827 --> 16:54.310
I'm done.
Are you?

16:54.379 --> 16:56.034
Oh, God.

16:56.103 --> 16:58.137
- Is the universe trying
to tell me something

16:58.206 --> 16:59.965
by putting Josh here
just when Charles and I

17:00.034 --> 17:02.103
are having this roadblock?

17:02.172 --> 17:05.241
I imagined Josh
in my room last night.

17:05.310 --> 17:08.344
I mean, it wasn't even real,
but I feel guilty

17:08.413 --> 17:10.551
for my own thoughts.
- Been there.

17:10.620 --> 17:13.793
- Oh, Josh is so beautiful.

17:13.862 --> 17:16.000
Every time I look at him,

17:16.068 --> 17:17.551
I have flashes of our sex.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.896
Oh, Maureen...
our sex!

17:19.965 --> 17:21.206
- Well!

17:21.275 --> 17:22.862
How is it with Charles?

17:22.931 --> 17:24.275
- Oh, don't get me wrong.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.241
It is really hot
with Charles too.

17:26.310 --> 17:29.172
- They bring out
different things in you.

17:29.241 --> 17:31.241
Why not just have both?
- Oh!

17:31.310 --> 17:33.827
but it doesn't work that way,
Nurse Maureen.

17:33.896 --> 17:35.413
I can't do that!

17:35.482 --> 17:37.103
- But can you do this?

17:44.000 --> 17:45.896
Yeah!
- Wow!

17:45.965 --> 17:47.241
I can't do that.

17:47.310 --> 17:49.137
- I bet you can!

17:56.310 --> 17:58.275
-  Whoa...

17:58.344 --> 17:59.896
I'm amazing!

17:59.965 --> 18:01.482
Ohh...ohh!

18:01.551 --> 18:04.000
- Look at you go!
- Oh!

18:39.827 --> 18:41.586
- ♪ Hey ♪

18:41.655 --> 18:43.620
♪ Hey ♪

18:43.689 --> 18:44.793
♪ Hey ♪

19:20.517 --> 19:22.310
- Yep.

19:22.379 --> 19:24.241
Super-taster.

19:30.413 --> 19:31.931
- You sure
you're okay?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.620
I burn bright,

19:33.689 --> 19:35.655
but I fade faster.

19:35.724 --> 19:37.965
- You know, I had
a really, uh,

19:38.034 --> 19:40.379
interesting conversation
with Josh.

19:40.448 --> 19:43.034
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, it's, uh,

19:43.103 --> 19:45.172
it's nice to see him
start a family.

19:45.241 --> 19:47.965
Makes me think about

19:48.034 --> 19:50.068
how important
family is to me.

19:50.137 --> 19:52.068
- For both of us.

19:52.137 --> 19:54.103
- You know,
I think this weekend

19:54.172 --> 19:56.206
really did expand
my mind...

19:57.586 --> 20:00.172
- In ways I wasn't
expecting.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.689
- You sure
you're okay to drive?

20:02.758 --> 20:05.379
- Yeah. Come on.

20:14.655 --> 20:16.241
- Hey.

20:16.310 --> 20:17.965
How was your weekend?

20:18.034 --> 20:21.448
- Well, I got hog-tied
in my painting harness.

20:21.517 --> 20:23.413
- Wh--
- And the guy that lives

20:23.482 --> 20:24.689
across the street
watched me

20:24.758 --> 20:26.482
while he jerked off
to it.

20:26.551 --> 20:28.034
- Oh, my God!
That is awful.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.965
Are you okay?
- Am I okay?

20:30.034 --> 20:33.344
I'm great.
I got my mojo back.

20:39.931 --> 20:42.206
-  And how was
your drug escapade?

20:42.275 --> 20:43.827
- Oh, do you have a cold?

20:43.896 --> 20:46.758
I have a lozenge in my purse.
- No, I'm--

20:46.827 --> 20:48.241
Don't you find it sexy?

20:48.310 --> 20:50.689
A lot of people
find it sexy.

20:50.758 --> 20:51.793
- Oh!

20:52.758 --> 20:53.827
Yes.

20:53.896 --> 20:56.103
- Never mind.
Just--where's my plant?

20:56.172 --> 20:57.862
- What?
- You kept sending me photos

20:57.931 --> 21:01.482
of a plant--I just assumed
it was a gift for me.

21:03.068 --> 21:05.000
- Maureen.

21:05.068 --> 21:06.379
- Hey,
did you get the book?

21:06.448 --> 21:07.793
- We don't know,

21:07.862 --> 21:09.827
but we got something
even better.

21:09.896 --> 21:11.103
- What?

21:11.172 --> 21:12.965
- Charles wants to
tell you himself.

21:15.551 --> 21:19.068
- Mercury's success has
started to hurt my family,

21:19.137 --> 21:21.862
which is...all of you.

21:21.931 --> 21:23.896
And it is time

21:23.965 --> 21:26.517
to let that go.

21:27.862 --> 21:30.586
- You're closing up Mercury.

21:30.655 --> 21:32.379
- I want you to buy it.

21:32.448 --> 21:35.172
- We'd love to, Charles,
but...

21:35.241 --> 21:37.793
we can't afford it.

21:46.965 --> 21:48.758
- Here's how much I want.

21:50.482 --> 21:52.827
Million dollars.

21:54.275 --> 21:56.482
We don't have
a million dollars.

21:56.551 --> 21:58.482
- I don't see any zeros.

21:58.551 --> 22:01.310
- $1.

22:01.379 --> 22:03.517
My grandfather mortgaged

22:03.586 --> 22:05.655
everything to start this place.

22:05.724 --> 22:08.620
He was doing something
to keep his family together,

22:08.689 --> 22:12.000
and I am tired
of fighting with mine.

22:13.413 --> 22:16.206
I want to come home.

22:16.275 --> 22:18.206
- As publisher.

22:18.275 --> 22:20.172
- If I come back,
it would be as an editor.

22:20.241 --> 22:23.862
An editor whose relationship
with a fellow editor

22:23.931 --> 22:26.068
is nobody's business.

22:26.137 --> 22:30.172
You would be publisher, Kelsey.
I would be working for you.

22:30.241 --> 22:31.689
Next to Liza.

22:33.068 --> 22:35.758
On those terms, uh,

22:35.827 --> 22:37.482
I say yes.

22:38.586 --> 22:40.379
Ladies?
- I say yes.

22:40.448 --> 22:41.862
- Oh, I absolutely
say yes.

22:41.931 --> 22:44.137
I'll give you a fiver.
You can keep the change.

22:44.206 --> 22:47.241
-  Thank you.

22:47.310 --> 22:49.413
I think we'll be stronger
together.
