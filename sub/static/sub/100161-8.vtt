Previously, on Ray Donovan...

00:24.610 --> 00:26.026
Aah!

00:26.027 --> 00:29.859
I taped every fuckin' thing
Jimmy ever said to me.

00:29.860 --> 00:32.189
_

00:48.800 --> 00:49.880
They're all dated.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.890
What the...

01:01.895 --> 01:03.229
Hands up!

01:21.320 --> 01:23.334
_

01:24.500 --> 01:26.127
Fuck this.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.569
I wanna... run the company.

01:53.570 --> 01:55.360
No.

01:56.540 --> 01:58.440
Your sister was my babysitter.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.830
No, no, no, no, no! No!

02:02.831 --> 02:04.589
You know, I've always liked Ray.

02:04.590 --> 02:06.668
Creative with violence.

02:21.250 --> 02:22.432
I'll kill him, Ray.

02:22.433 --> 02:23.894
I'll fuckin' kill him.

02:31.420 --> 02:33.069
Mick's your father, huh?

02:33.070 --> 02:35.189
That knife for him?

02:53.180 --> 02:55.000
What have I got this afternoon?

02:55.008 --> 02:57.059
Cancel them both.

02:57.060 --> 02:59.759
And get Miss Lee to come in at four.

02:59.760 --> 03:03.859
Tell her I need a full Swedish.
I'm a fuckin' wreck.

03:03.860 --> 03:07.399
And that, uh, that
acupuncture, uh, guy...

03:07.400 --> 03:09.109
what's his name?

03:09.110 --> 03:10.899
Yeah, him.

03:13.950 --> 03:15.863
Ah...

03:51.320 --> 03:53.479
Die, you motherfucker!

03:54.490 --> 03:56.019
- Get down!
- Fucker!

04:13.170 --> 04:15.213
Fuckin' O'Malley.

04:17.216 --> 04:20.761
Piece a shit.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.989
You sleep at all?

05:28.700 --> 05:30.389
The first time I met your father,

05:30.390 --> 05:32.599
I was ten years old...

05:32.600 --> 05:34.900
in a bar.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.579
I was lookin' for my father.

05:37.580 --> 05:39.739
I went in there with a...

05:39.740 --> 05:42.359
uh... with a kitchen knife,

05:42.360 --> 05:44.000
thinkin' I was gonna kill him.

05:45.430 --> 05:47.049
Your father stopped me.

05:47.050 --> 05:50.517
Sent me back home.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.080
Hello?

06:15.140 --> 06:16.580
Oh, my God.

06:43.695 --> 06:44.905
_

07:04.340 --> 07:06.169
Hey, you.

07:06.170 --> 07:08.349
Hey, Jas, listen,

07:08.350 --> 07:10.599
I need you to bring me my passport,

07:10.600 --> 07:12.057
and then bring your passport.

07:12.058 --> 07:15.769
- What?
- And I need you to bring my gun.

07:15.770 --> 07:17.853
What the fuck is goin' on, Daryll?

07:30.450 --> 07:32.451
- What's goin' on?
- We got a broken main.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.162
It's gonna be a while.

08:29.720 --> 08:30.759
Smitty?

08:32.720 --> 08:35.269
Oh!

08:35.270 --> 08:37.130
Hey, Ray.

08:38.934 --> 08:40.139
Ya all right?

08:40.140 --> 08:43.089
Yeah, oh, I'm great.
I, uh, came in early.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.529
I was gonna get a head start on, uh,

08:44.530 --> 08:47.360
some... some work, you know.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.322
All right.

08:51.323 --> 08:54.359
Why don't you go to the corner
and get us a couple coffees.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.819
Yeah, yeah, coff... Ab-absolutely.

09:17.270 --> 09:20.269
Hey, Ray, that, um,
detective picked me up

09:20.270 --> 09:22.269
and she brought me in for questioning.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.759
Yeah, I know. Terry told me.

09:23.760 --> 09:26.759
Yeah, well, it was just
kinda more of the same...

09:26.760 --> 09:29.692
showed me pictures of
heads, went over the alibi.

09:29.693 --> 09:31.947
- I didn't say anything different.
- All right.

09:31.948 --> 09:34.616
Yeah. I ju-just wanted you to know.

09:37.520 --> 09:42.499
Okay. Right, um... coffee.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.041
Aw, shit.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.499
- I got it.
- No, I got it.

09:46.500 --> 09:50.215
Good morning. Ray Donovan's office.

09:54.100 --> 09:55.799
Hey, it's a... it's a collect call

09:55.800 --> 09:57.620
from a Manhattan detention complex.

09:57.630 --> 09:58.849
Guy named Gary O'Malley?

10:02.940 --> 10:04.519
- Gary?
- Ray.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.099
Aw, thank God.

10:06.100 --> 10:09.029
Listen, I need your help.

10:09.030 --> 10:12.819
That fuck Jim Sullivan...
cocksucker thinks

10:12.820 --> 10:14.698
he can get away with
murder. Well, fuck that!

10:15.840 --> 10:17.570
What are you talkin' about, Gary?

10:17.576 --> 10:19.079
Fuckin' Sullivan!

10:19.080 --> 10:22.780
He fucking killed my father and Ronny!

10:24.660 --> 10:26.259
Gary, you got a lawyer?

10:26.260 --> 10:28.002
This ain't about goddamn lawyers.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.839
It's about gettin' even
with that piece of shit.

10:30.840 --> 10:33.669
What makes you so sure it was Sullivan?

10:33.670 --> 10:37.219
'Cause I got pictures
of that fat little fuck.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.199
At my brother's house.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.809
- Pictures?
- Just come down here.

10:51.760 --> 10:54.159
First you fuck over my brother,

10:54.160 --> 10:56.329
then you're literally fucking my sister.

10:56.330 --> 10:59.409
Jesus Christ, Ray, what's that about?

10:59.410 --> 11:01.909
Can't find anybody better than Molly?

11:01.910 --> 11:03.779
What're you doin' here, Declan?

11:03.780 --> 11:05.289
My dad wants those stocks back.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.209
Says your half-breed brother took 'em.

11:07.210 --> 11:08.759
So take it up with him.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.919
See, I was thinkin', you know,
since he's your brother and all

11:11.920 --> 11:14.299
maybe you should be the one to do that.

11:14.300 --> 11:15.719
Yeah?

11:15.720 --> 11:17.979
I mean, I could do it but, you know,

11:17.980 --> 11:20.130
might get messy.

11:20.138 --> 11:22.432
You remember that time in sixth grade

11:22.433 --> 11:25.100
when I kicked the shit outta you?

11:25.101 --> 11:27.880
No, I don't.

11:29.110 --> 11:30.599
Well, let me ask you somethin'.

11:30.600 --> 11:33.619
Were you... were you already
suckin' Father O'Connor's dick

11:33.620 --> 11:35.619
at that point?

11:35.620 --> 11:37.279
One way or another,

11:37.280 --> 11:39.759
I'm gonna get back what's ours.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.909
If you don't wanna help
with Sammy Davis Donovan,

11:41.910 --> 11:44.529
I'll do it myself.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.179
Yeah, Ray.

12:07.180 --> 12:09.720
I need you to rent a car and
go stake out Daryll's place.

12:12.260 --> 12:14.649
Fine.

12:43.140 --> 12:45.473
I had an emerald necklace.

12:47.780 --> 12:50.239
Wha... w-w-what was that?

12:50.240 --> 12:52.839
An emerald necklace.

12:52.840 --> 12:57.339
Been handed down mother
to daughter in my family

12:57.340 --> 12:59.219
for three generations.

12:59.220 --> 13:01.519
I promised it to my daughter.

13:01.520 --> 13:05.702
Oh, that's, uh... that's nice.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.359
W... w...

13:09.360 --> 13:11.490
when I first went to the Center,

13:11.499 --> 13:15.839
we were told all jewelry
and m-m-money...

13:15.840 --> 13:19.849
We were told we had to hand them over

13:19.850 --> 13:20.880
to the shaman.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.239
What?

13:23.240 --> 13:25.779
But when I called to get it back,

13:25.780 --> 13:29.729
they said they didn't have it,
I must have misremembered.

13:29.730 --> 13:31.729
I didn't misremember.

13:31.730 --> 13:35.399
I didn't. I gave it to them to keep.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.640
They stole it from me.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.520
Dolores, are you sure?

13:41.529 --> 13:43.989
I need you to get it back for me.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.999
No, I... Dolores, I-I can't just... I...

13:47.000 --> 13:49.629
Oh, please, I just wanna
give it to my daughter

13:49.630 --> 13:52.079
before I die.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.899
Ohh...

13:53.900 --> 13:56.879
All right.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.219
- It's all right.
- Ohh...

13:59.220 --> 14:01.589
It's all right.

14:05.160 --> 14:09.279
He pulled my father
outta his nursing home.

14:09.280 --> 14:12.819
Ray, he fuckin' electrocuted him.

14:12.820 --> 14:15.439
Then he went after Ronny.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.779
He stabbed him to death.

14:17.780 --> 14:20.069
All because of these fuckin' tapes!

14:22.620 --> 14:25.659
You know, you remember...

14:25.660 --> 14:27.409
what a piece of shit

14:27.410 --> 14:29.744
that Jim Sullivan was when we was kids.

14:29.745 --> 14:32.340
My father had to protect himself.

14:32.350 --> 14:34.745
He recorded a bunch of his
conversations with him.

14:34.746 --> 14:35.799
Sullivan's the only one

14:35.800 --> 14:38.709
who woulda given a
fuck about them tapes.

14:38.710 --> 14:41.213
What'd you mean about
there bein' pictures?

14:41.214 --> 14:43.679
Ronny rigged a surveillance camera.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.889
He hid it above the safe.

14:45.890 --> 14:50.170
It's gotta have pictures of
that murderin' motherfucker.

14:52.380 --> 14:54.359
All right.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.979
I'll check it out.

14:55.980 --> 14:57.480
Thanks, Ray.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.041
See, that's what I call reliable.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.669
Like a Timex, this kid.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.339
Why can't you clods
be that reliable, huh?

15:22.340 --> 15:24.799
That's for you, Ray.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.349
- Thanks, Mr. Sullivan.
- You got it.

15:27.350 --> 15:28.386
Ray.

15:30.060 --> 15:32.514
When I first laid eyes on you, I said,

15:32.515 --> 15:36.479
"That kid's gonna make himself
fuckin' useful one day."

15:36.480 --> 15:38.319
And ya did.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.680
I was right.

15:42.110 --> 15:44.409
One more thing I want ya to do.

15:44.410 --> 15:47.439
You make it to school today?

15:47.440 --> 15:50.449
You know how important education is.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.019
Aw...

15:56.020 --> 15:59.740
And, um... before ya leave...

16:02.800 --> 16:06.591
Make sure he knows... you speak for me.

16:27.870 --> 16:29.530
Hey, what the fuck?

16:29.531 --> 16:32.159
- Are you Ricky Ronsen?
- Who the hell are you?

16:32.160 --> 16:35.328
You owe Jim Sullivan $600.

16:35.329 --> 16:37.279
So what?

16:37.280 --> 16:39.372
- I'm here to collect.
- No shit.

16:39.373 --> 16:40.917
Should I go get it for ya?

16:40.918 --> 16:42.709
Yeah.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.754
Fuck off.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.633
Fuck!

17:17.912 --> 17:20.858
What the fuck?

17:20.859 --> 17:23.279
You owe Jim Sullivan $600.

17:23.280 --> 17:24.959
Tell Jim Sullivan he wants his money

17:24.960 --> 17:27.239
come back and ask for it himself.

17:27.240 --> 17:30.539
Now get your ass outta here
before I kick ya in the balls.

17:30.540 --> 17:33.427
Now.

17:33.428 --> 17:34.929
Hey, what the fuck are you doin'?

17:34.930 --> 17:36.889
Aah!

17:36.890 --> 17:38.699
You gonna gimme the money?

17:38.700 --> 17:39.929
Fuck you!

17:39.930 --> 17:41.640
Aah!

17:41.650 --> 17:43.479
Aah!

17:43.480 --> 17:46.819
$600.

17:49.420 --> 17:51.659
It's all I got, I swear to God.

17:54.100 --> 17:55.569
Wait... maybe my brother'll come by

17:55.570 --> 17:56.993
with another hundred tomorrow.

17:56.994 --> 17:59.339
Along the inside...

17:59.340 --> 18:02.619
- This real?
- 'Course it's fuckin' real.

18:02.620 --> 18:04.139
What do ya think?

18:04.140 --> 18:06.129
As they head down the far side.

18:06.130 --> 18:08.259
Mighty Bull and Captain Courageous

18:08.260 --> 18:10.719
opening up a three and a half lengths...

18:48.400 --> 18:50.380
- Hey, Ter.
- I need a ride.

18:51.590 --> 18:53.199
I'm sorry. I gotta do something for Ray.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.339
Fuck that. This is important.

18:55.340 --> 18:57.019
- Ter...
- When have I ever asked you

18:57.020 --> 18:58.589
for anything, Bunch?

18:58.590 --> 19:02.300
I need a ride fuckin'
upstate, and I need it now.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.979
Hey, you need, uh, help

19:48.980 --> 19:50.732
with whatever it is that you're doin'?

19:50.733 --> 19:51.839
No.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.639
I just thought that I
could come with you

19:53.640 --> 19:56.069
- in case you needed me.
- I don't need you.

19:56.070 --> 19:58.029
I-I-I could do stuff. I could, you know,

19:58.030 --> 20:00.699
create a diversion, or...

20:00.700 --> 20:02.827
I could go get coffee.

20:06.320 --> 20:07.599
I'm sure you're wondering why

20:07.600 --> 20:10.379
I slept at the office last night.

20:10.380 --> 20:12.969
Well...

20:12.970 --> 20:14.759
Bridget and me...

20:14.760 --> 20:17.139
we're still on the outs.

20:17.140 --> 20:20.303
I know that you think that I
should just get over it, but...

20:23.340 --> 20:26.309
You're an adult. She's an adult.

20:26.310 --> 20:28.561
You'll figure it out.

20:42.620 --> 20:45.619
I keep having dreams about those cops.

20:45.620 --> 20:49.790
It's all just so clear
and then it takes over.

20:49.791 --> 20:53.589
I just... I don't know
where to put it all.

20:53.590 --> 20:57.300
Do you still think about what we did?

20:59.260 --> 21:01.579
Get some sleep.

21:01.580 --> 21:04.160
You need it.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.519
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.959
I brought what you asked me for.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.560
No, no, no, not... not out here, inside.

21:30.060 --> 21:32.000
Stay in the car.

22:31.060 --> 22:35.199
Oh... Holy shit, that's a lotta blood.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.856
Thought I told you to stay in the car.

22:39.860 --> 22:41.903
Is this a crime scene?

22:45.300 --> 22:48.360
Think that Gary guy did this?

22:50.420 --> 22:52.160
Ah, fuck.

22:52.163 --> 22:54.619
Ah...

22:54.620 --> 22:57.280
Wait... is that Daryll?

23:01.714 --> 23:03.090
_

23:04.500 --> 23:06.400
You just erased all that?

23:10.680 --> 23:12.039
Let's go.

23:21.150 --> 23:23.299
Hey, that was pretty awesome.

23:23.300 --> 23:25.159
You're very stealth.

23:25.160 --> 23:27.680
Like a fuckin' ninja.

24:03.600 --> 24:07.680
Wow. This is nice.

24:16.220 --> 24:18.160
Wait here.

24:19.590 --> 24:20.879
Hey, Terry.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.540
Fuck you.

24:27.940 --> 24:29.680
Hey.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.510
Hey.

24:42.380 --> 24:45.734
Terry. It's so nice to see you.

24:45.735 --> 24:49.189
I come for Dolores's necklace.

24:49.190 --> 24:51.281
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

24:51.282 --> 24:53.868
I need the necklace.

24:55.620 --> 25:00.159
This is something that transpired
between myself and Dolores,

25:00.160 --> 25:02.379
something she gave up freely

25:02.380 --> 25:06.479
and generously to rid
herself of negative energy

25:06.480 --> 25:08.359
and to benefit the Center.

25:08.360 --> 25:11.879
I'm gonna ask you one more fuckin' time.

25:11.880 --> 25:15.849
Terry, forget this false quest...

25:15.850 --> 25:20.339
and let me help you move through
your own phases of mortality.

25:20.340 --> 25:22.479
Don't do this to yourself, Terr...

25:22.480 --> 25:25.439
You fuck... Ohh... Aah!

25:26.690 --> 25:28.239
- Aah!
- Fuck!

25:28.240 --> 25:29.779
- Now, where is it?
- Uhh...

25:29.780 --> 25:32.489
Where's the fuckin' necklace?

25:32.490 --> 25:35.099
I'd tell him where it is, I were you.

25:35.100 --> 25:36.118
Up there!

25:36.119 --> 25:38.499
Box on the top shelf!

25:38.500 --> 25:39.580
Bunch.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.499
Holy shit.

25:45.500 --> 25:48.672
- Which one?
- The emerald.

25:55.100 --> 25:56.430
Got it.

25:57.640 --> 25:58.929
All right.

26:20.200 --> 26:22.919
Can I ask you somethin'?

26:22.920 --> 26:25.079
Terry said that

26:25.080 --> 26:28.059
whatever happens between me and Bridget

26:28.060 --> 26:31.239
I can't leave the family 'cause
we killed all those cops.

26:31.240 --> 26:33.009
What?

26:33.010 --> 26:35.094
I-I think about it all the time.

26:35.095 --> 26:37.019
Do you think about it?

26:37.020 --> 26:38.848
You think about what you did?

26:38.849 --> 26:42.269
I mean, just the sound
of that fire poker

26:42.270 --> 26:44.102
goin' through that guy, I...

26:44.103 --> 26:48.439
I-I-I can't get that outta my head.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.949
Never done anything like that before.

26:50.950 --> 26:55.071
And Daryll said that you
went crazy on that cop.

26:55.072 --> 26:57.532
He said that you shot him like 20 times.

26:57.533 --> 27:00.150
I shot him, he's dead.
What's the difference?

27:02.370 --> 27:03.979
You don't feel bad?

27:03.980 --> 27:06.629
You don't feel bad for the families?

27:06.630 --> 27:09.259
No, I don't feel bad.

27:09.260 --> 27:11.379
He got what he deserved.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.756
Yeah.

27:13.757 --> 27:16.049
I don't feel bad either.

27:16.050 --> 27:19.370
That cop was gonna kill Aunt Sandy.

27:21.320 --> 27:24.180
I did what I had to do too.

27:40.110 --> 27:42.119
This is not automatic.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.079
- What?
- Just so you know.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.899
- What you talkin' 'bout?
- I don't date thugs.

27:46.900 --> 27:48.919
I ain't no thug.

27:48.920 --> 27:51.239
"Bring me my passport and my gun."

27:51.240 --> 27:52.259
I didn't sound like that.

27:53.720 --> 27:54.924
Daryll Donovan.

27:54.925 --> 27:56.919
You in there?

27:56.920 --> 27:58.761
It's Declan Sullivan.
I know you're in there.

27:58.762 --> 28:01.960
Hide, hide.

28:06.480 --> 28:08.646
- What you want?
- Wanna make a deal.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.199
What kinda deal?

28:17.200 --> 28:19.159
You got somethin' that
I want back, that's all.

28:19.160 --> 28:22.576
I'm prepared to pay to
get it... cash, today.

28:24.400 --> 28:25.859
How much we talkin'?

28:25.860 --> 28:27.915
Two million.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.330
Come in.

28:40.080 --> 28:41.939
It's not as simple as you think,

28:41.940 --> 28:44.097
transferring those stocks to cash.

28:44.098 --> 28:46.514
If you don't have any experience
with this type o' thing,

28:46.515 --> 28:48.309
it's very easy to get caught.

28:48.310 --> 28:51.109
Very easy.

28:51.110 --> 28:53.779
This way, two million in cash...

28:53.780 --> 28:55.890
bird in the hand.

28:58.660 --> 29:00.980
It's cash.

29:04.790 --> 29:06.159
All right.

29:06.160 --> 29:07.809
Gotta give me about an hour though.

29:07.810 --> 29:10.629
All right. And...

29:10.630 --> 29:12.835
you know, call me when you're ready.

29:35.566 --> 29:37.489
So... did you find it?

29:37.490 --> 29:39.611
- Yeah.
- And?

29:40.660 --> 29:42.281
Nothin'.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.480
What do ya mean, nothin'?

29:45.660 --> 29:48.039
I dunno. Wasn't workin'.

29:48.040 --> 29:50.539
Looks like it hadn't been
workin' for a while.

29:50.540 --> 29:52.081
What the fuck?

29:52.082 --> 29:55.043
It was workin' last time I checked.

29:56.860 --> 29:58.750
I don't know what to tell ya, Gary.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.550
Fuck...

30:04.620 --> 30:07.019
Look...

30:07.020 --> 30:08.779
I'm gonna...

30:08.780 --> 30:10.059
I'm gonna call a lawyer right now,

30:10.060 --> 30:12.700
we'll see if he can help ya out here.

30:14.380 --> 30:16.809
Are you still workin'
for that piece a shit?

30:16.810 --> 30:18.299
What?

30:18.300 --> 30:21.612
Sullivan! Are you still
in his fuckin' pocket?

30:24.080 --> 30:25.909
Look, Gary, I'm sorry for you...

30:25.910 --> 30:27.867
After everything he did to your family?

30:27.868 --> 30:30.820
To your wife and to your sister?

30:33.760 --> 30:35.330
What are you talkin' about?

30:36.120 --> 30:38.779
Fuck you, Ray.

30:38.780 --> 30:43.219
You go ask that motherfuckin'
subhuman yourself.

30:43.220 --> 30:45.599
Guard!

30:48.500 --> 30:50.059
All right.

30:50.060 --> 30:51.933
Let's go.

31:05.370 --> 31:08.990
- Hi.
- Hey.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.909
Hey, where are you?

31:10.910 --> 31:13.359
I wanted to ask you about those tapes.

31:13.360 --> 31:14.659
Yeah?

31:14.660 --> 31:17.589
Is there anything in there
from the fall of '87?

31:17.590 --> 31:19.837
Around the time Bridget passed?

31:21.240 --> 31:24.049
Um... I can check.

31:24.050 --> 31:26.259
Think you can get 'em to me?

31:26.260 --> 31:27.509
Why?

31:27.510 --> 31:30.219
Are you okay?

31:30.220 --> 31:32.059
Yeah.

31:32.060 --> 31:33.558
I'll call ya later.

32:30.660 --> 32:32.369
It's Ray.

32:32.370 --> 32:34.100
Come on in, Ray.

32:42.800 --> 32:45.049
And McKinley, the Pro
Bowl defensive tackle...

32:45.050 --> 32:48.460
That, uh, degenerate Ronsen
give you any problems?

32:48.470 --> 32:51.210
Gave me this.

32:52.280 --> 32:54.259
- That real?
- Yeah.

32:54.260 --> 32:56.559
Ha ha ha.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.170
Oh...

33:01.740 --> 33:03.999
Hand-off to Jackson,
up the middle for a no gain.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.539
Second and ten from the 25.

33:06.540 --> 33:08.579
That's really poor execution there

33:08.580 --> 33:09.989
that time by the offense.

33:16.860 --> 33:18.039
Yastrzemski.

33:18.040 --> 33:20.369
That's worth more than 600 bucks.

33:27.970 --> 33:29.429
That's for you.

33:29.430 --> 33:30.679
No, I'm all right.

33:30.680 --> 33:32.970
What, you don't like dogs?

33:34.310 --> 33:35.899
You want a drink?

33:35.900 --> 33:37.460
Sure.

33:38.920 --> 33:41.470
Cortez, who was almost
immediately taken down

33:41.478 --> 33:43.439
by the defense...

33:52.600 --> 33:54.740
Sláinte.

33:57.330 --> 33:59.099
Ahh.

33:59.100 --> 34:01.379
You're a good kid, Ray.

34:01.380 --> 34:04.629
Look, I know you had a rough life.

34:04.630 --> 34:06.199
I know.

34:06.200 --> 34:09.579
You need anything, anything at all,

34:09.580 --> 34:11.839
you come see me.

34:11.840 --> 34:13.620
Yeah?

34:18.179 --> 34:20.040
Uhh!

34:30.440 --> 34:32.699
- I'm thinkin'...
- What you thinkin'?

34:32.699 --> 34:35.018
There's this island on Galapagos, right?

34:35.020 --> 34:37.399
- Mmm.
- And like they have these birds

34:37.400 --> 34:39.219
that you can just pull off the branch.

34:39.219 --> 34:40.958
So there's not... there's
no predators out there,

34:40.960 --> 34:43.080
so they don't know what
it's like to be scared.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.583
- Like, fear is not in their vocabulary.
- Wow.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.799
So I'm figurin'...

34:47.800 --> 34:49.799
we get a one-way ticket.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.179
- One way?
- Yeah.

34:51.179 --> 34:54.175
- What?
- To Antigua or the Caribbean.

34:54.176 --> 34:57.804
- One way?
- See the sunset, yes, around...

35:01.310 --> 35:02.934
All right, here we go.

35:10.070 --> 35:12.611
What's up, fellas?

35:20.240 --> 35:21.328
Ha.

35:23.320 --> 35:25.959
The fuck? Where's the re...

35:25.960 --> 35:28.399
Sorry... cash flow's a
little tight right now.

35:28.400 --> 35:29.919
Hand over the stocks.

35:37.800 --> 35:40.514
Jasmine, pop the trunk.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.736
Shit, get... Yo, get in
the car! Get in the car!

35:55.737 --> 35:58.531
Aah...

36:01.410 --> 36:02.952
Holy shit!

36:04.770 --> 36:05.899
Goddamn...

36:05.900 --> 36:07.207
Oh, shit!

36:10.836 --> 36:12.629
Jas!

36:12.630 --> 36:14.172
Oh, fu...

36:16.216 --> 36:17.843
Fuck!

37:04.140 --> 37:07.349
Ray, what are you doin' here?

37:07.350 --> 37:09.640
- Nothin'.
- What is that?

37:10.820 --> 37:12.353
Cute.

37:12.354 --> 37:14.319
- Bridget!
- Hi, Ray.

37:14.320 --> 37:15.819
- Hi, Gary.
- Hi, Molly!

37:15.820 --> 37:16.999
Ready to make pies?

37:17.000 --> 37:19.570
We got a ton of limes!

37:20.760 --> 37:22.319
You want me to pick you up later?

37:22.320 --> 37:24.119
Nah. Mr. Sullivan'll give me a ride.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.839
- Come on!
- Okay.

37:29.420 --> 37:30.700
Good night.

37:30.710 --> 37:32.751
Good night.

37:34.670 --> 37:37.030
What happened to you?

37:38.660 --> 37:40.679
This?

37:40.680 --> 37:43.599
You workin' for him now?

37:43.600 --> 37:45.019
Me?

37:45.020 --> 37:48.590
Jesus, Ray. Seriously?

40:16.330 --> 40:19.089
This is Dr. Arthur Amiot.

40:19.090 --> 40:21.419
Please leave a detailed message,

40:21.420 --> 40:23.659
and I'll return your
call as soon as possible.

40:40.360 --> 40:43.900
Is it okay if I stay here again tonight?

40:45.400 --> 40:46.519
Sure.

40:48.410 --> 40:49.780
Night.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.890
'Kay, good night.

41:34.080 --> 41:35.700
What's wrong?

41:46.510 --> 41:48.589
Take your shirt off.

41:48.590 --> 41:52.859
Ray...

41:52.860 --> 41:56.130
I didn't know what else to do.

41:57.440 --> 41:59.919
That detective was gonna
come after Bridget.

41:59.920 --> 42:02.089
I didn't have any other option.

42:02.090 --> 42:04.731
Take your fuckin' shirt off.

42:32.960 --> 42:35.010
I'm sorry.

42:57.534 --> 43:00.249
All right, Mr. Donovan,
I need you to relax, okay?

43:00.250 --> 43:02.879
I need you to stop right there, okay?

43:02.880 --> 43:04.957
I said I need you to stop.

43:04.958 --> 43:07.251
God damn it, I said sto... Uhh...

43:07.252 --> 43:09.169
On the ground.

43:09.170 --> 43:10.964
I said get on the fucking ground.

43:20.940 --> 43:24.340
Get on the fucking ground.

43:29.180 --> 43:32.569
You wanna talk?

43:32.570 --> 43:34.559
Let's talk.
