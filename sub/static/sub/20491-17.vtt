01:40.834 --> 01:43.334
I HEARD SHOUTING.
ARE YOU OKAY?

01:43.434 --> 01:45.901
YEAH.
SORRY.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.901
I JUST HAD A
BRUTAL NIGHTMARE.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.300
OH, I COULD USE
SOME ASPIRIN TOO.

01:53.400 --> 01:56.501
I THINK ONE OF US NEEDS
TO LAY OFF THE TEQUILA.

01:59.167 --> 02:00.834
LEXA...

02:00.934 --> 02:04.200
WHAT?

02:04.300 --> 02:06.033
DON'T MOVE.

02:09.501 --> 02:12.300
OH, MY GOD.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.434
WHAT HAPPENED?

02:13.534 --> 02:14.801
WHERE ARE YOU HURT?

02:14.901 --> 02:18.033
I'M... I'M FINE.

02:19.934 --> 02:23.534
IT'S NOT MY BLOOD.

02:27.100 --> 02:31.100
<i>SCIENTIST ADAM KANE WAS A
<i>PIONEER OF GENETIC RESEARCH,</i></i>

02:31.200 --> 02:35.834

03:20.033 --> 03:23.100
<i>THEY ARE... MUTANT X.</i>

03:31.000 --> 03:32.734
IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY?

03:32.834 --> 03:33.901
WELL, LET'S SEE.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.167
YOU CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST THREE HOURS.

03:35.267 --> 03:36.534
YOU WOKE UP COVERED
WITH BLOOD.

03:36.634 --> 03:40.300
SO, YEAH...
I KINDA SAY IT IS.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.634
RELAX.

03:41.734 --> 03:42.801
I'M GOING TO DO A BIOSCAN,

03:42.901 --> 03:45.501
JUST TO RULE OUT
ANYTHING INTERNAL, OKAY?

03:45.601 --> 03:47.901
I THINK YOU JUST
LIKE PLAYING DOCTOR.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.601
YEAH, YOU WISH.

03:49.701 --> 03:51.567
LOOK, WHATEVER IT IS
THAT'S GOING ON HERE,

03:51.667 --> 03:54.067
WE'RE GOING TO
FIGURE IT OUT.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.334
ANYTHING YET?

04:02.434 --> 04:04.567
YEAH, YOUR SYNAPSES ARE
FIRING AT AN ODD RATE.

04:04.667 --> 04:06.567
IT COULD BE WHAT'S
CAUSING THE...

04:06.667 --> 04:08.000
HEADACHE.

04:08.100 --> 04:09.200
WHAT?

04:09.300 --> 04:11.801
YOUR IMPLANT.

04:11.901 --> 04:14.367
YOU NEVER DID SAY WHAT
ECKHART USED IT FOR.

04:14.467 --> 04:16.634
WELL, TRUST ME,
IT'S A NON-ISSUE.

04:16.733 --> 04:17.901
IT WAS JUST A DATA JACK.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.334
THE DOMINION DEACTIVATED
IT YEARS AGO.

04:20.434 --> 04:23.234
YOU KNOW, MAYBE THIS WAS
ALL A BAD DREAM, YOU KNOW?

04:23.334 --> 04:24.434
AND A NOSEBLEED?

04:24.534 --> 04:25.767
DOUBT IT.

04:25.868 --> 04:27.033
I CHECKED OUT THE HELIX.

04:27.133 --> 04:28.701
LOOKS LIKE YOU TOOK HER
OUT SOLO A FEW HOURS AGO.

04:28.801 --> 04:29.968
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

04:30.067 --> 04:31.601
WHERE DID I GO?

04:31.701 --> 04:32.901
I CAN RECONSTRUCT
THE FLIGHT PATH.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.300
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T
GO BACK THERE, LEXA.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.434
NOT IF THERE'S ANY CHANCE
YOUR NIGHTMARE WAS REAL

04:36.534 --> 04:38.200
SHAL AND I WILL
HANDLE THE RECON.

04:38.300 --> 04:40.200
YEAH, NOW WHO'S DREAMING?

05:02.434 --> 05:04.100
<whispering>
SHAL...

05:04.200 --> 05:10.334
ARE YOU, UH, BUYING
THIS WHOLE AMNESIA CRAP?

05:10.434 --> 05:11.901
THINK SHE'S LYING?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.667
WHO? COMPLEXA?

05:13.767 --> 05:14.868
I MEAN, COME ON,

05:14.968 --> 05:16.734
WHENEVER HAS SHE EVER
TOLD US THE WHOLE STORY?

05:16.834 --> 05:20.033
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU KNOW, IF IT
WAS ME AND I WOKE UP COVERED IN
SOMEBODY ELSE'S BLOOD,

05:20.133 --> 05:22.100
I'M SURE I'D REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.167
WELL, MAYBE SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO REMEMBER.

05:24.267 --> 05:27.767
YEAH, MAYBE SHE'S JUST TRYING
TO HIDE SOMETHING ELSE.

05:53.400 --> 05:56.434
WELL, IF YOU WERE GOING
FOR SUBTLE, YOU MISSED.

05:56.534 --> 05:59.033
LOOKS LIKE YOU WERE TRYING TO
SEND SOMEONE A MESSAGE, LEX.

05:59.133 --> 06:03.133
YEAH, JUST WISH
WE KNEW WHO.

06:03.234 --> 06:07.033
WELL, AT LEAST SHE CUT
OFF COMMUNICATIONS.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.534
SHOULD BUY US SOME TIME.

06:11.467 --> 06:13.367
WHAT IS IT, LEX?

06:13.467 --> 06:16.200
THERE'S MORE.

06:26.367 --> 06:27.534
<Shal>
<i>THE GOOD NEWS IS</i>

06:27.634 --> 06:28.968
<i>LEXA DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY
<i>ABOUT ANY WITNESSES.</i></i>

06:29.067 --> 06:32.934
<Brennan>
THE BAD NEWS IS
THEY'RE ALL DEAD.

06:33.033 --> 06:35.434
SO FAR I COUNT FIVE.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.667
MAKE THAT SIX.

06:52.434 --> 06:54.267
TRAIL ENDS HERE.

06:54.367 --> 06:55.701
AND YOU'RE TRYING
TO TELL ME

06:55.801 --> 06:57.033
YOU DON'T REMEMBER
DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

06:57.133 --> 06:59.067
I REMEMBER KILLING
HIM IN MY DREAM.

06:59.167 --> 07:02.434
HE BEGGED, BUT IT
DIDN'T DO MUCH GOOD.

07:07.701 --> 07:09.000
HEY, JESS?

07:09.100 --> 07:13.133
SEE WHAT YOU CAN GET
ME ON DR. REMY ARNOT
IN THE DATABASE.

07:13.234 --> 07:14.501
JESS?

07:14.601 --> 07:15.467
YEAH.

07:15.567 --> 07:17.267
UH...

07:17.367 --> 07:21.868
DR. REMY ARNOT.

07:21.968 --> 07:24.501
OH, ONE TIME HEAD
RESEARCHER AT GENOMEX.

07:24.601 --> 07:29.267
LAST WORKED IN SOMETHING
CALLED PROJECT NINE.

07:29.367 --> 07:32.067
WHICH HE CO-CREATED WITH
THREE OTHER DOCTORS...

07:32.167 --> 07:35.701
DOCTOR SAMUEL HOWELL, BEATRICE
LANG AND JOHN GONSALVES.

07:35.801 --> 07:37.834
OKAY, WHAT'S
PROJECT NINE?

07:37.934 --> 07:41.567
<i>I'M WORKING ON THAT.
<i>JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE.</i></i>

07:41.667 --> 07:45.100
GUYS... WE HAVE TO
GET OUT OF HERE FAST.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.334
LEX, WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:47.434 --> 07:48.834
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIM.

07:48.934 --> 07:51.801
YEAH, BUT I KNOW
WHO HE WORKS FOR.

07:55.834 --> 08:01.534
<gunfire>

08:01.634 --> 08:03.834
COVER ME.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.501
PRETTY WELL-ARMED
FOR ALARM TECHS.

08:16.601 --> 08:18.167
WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:18.267 --> 08:19.300
THEY'RE JUST RECON.

08:19.400 --> 08:20.701
THEIR BACKUP WILL BE
HERE IN A FEW MINUTES.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.434
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH
WITH THE CRYPTIC, LEX.

08:22.534 --> 08:23.567
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:23.667 --> 08:25.000
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?

08:25.100 --> 08:26.234
BECAUSE IT'S OUR PROTOCOL.

08:26.334 --> 08:27.501
THIS IS A DOMINION FACILITY.

08:27.601 --> 08:28.901
ARNOT WAS A
DOMINION DOCTOR.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.968
I JUST ATTACKED MY OWN PEOPLE
AND I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHY.

08:31.067 --> 08:32.567
<i>JESS, YOU GETTING THIS, MAN?</i>

08:32.667 --> 08:33.833
YEAH, EVERY WORD OF IT.

08:33.933 --> 08:35.100
LISTEN, WE GOT OTHER PROBLEMS.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.200
BRING LEXA STRAIGHT IN.

08:36.299 --> 08:37.467
DON'T LET HER STOP
FOR ANYTHING,

08:37.567 --> 08:40.167
AND DO NOT LET
DOWN YOUR GUARD.

08:43.667 --> 08:44.868
<i>LEXA.</i>

08:46.334 --> 08:47.734
YOU LIED TO ME.

08:47.834 --> 08:49.300
YOU TOLD ME THIS
THING WAS NEUTRALIZED.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.067
SOMEBODY'S ACTIVATING IT AGAIN.

08:51.167 --> 08:52.334
<i>THAT ISN'T POSSIBLE.</i>

08:52.434 --> 08:53.400
REALLY?

08:53.501 --> 08:54.667
WHY DON'T YOU TELL IT
TO THE FIVE MEN

08:54.767 --> 08:56.200
I JUST BUTCHERED AT MAXXLON.
INCLUDING DR. ARNOT.

08:57.467 --> 08:59.234
<i>YOU NEED TO COME IN.</i>

08:59.334 --> 09:00.267
NO.

09:00.367 --> 09:01.534
<i>I CAN CONTAIN THIS FOR NOW.</i>

09:01.634 --> 09:02.968
<i>BUT ONCE THE
<i>BOARD LEARNS</i></i>

09:03.067 --> 09:05.767
<i>SOMEONE'S USING
<i>YOU AGAINST US...</i></i>

09:06.968 --> 09:09.634
DON'T GO IN.

09:15.434 --> 09:17.634
AM I DREAMING?

09:17.734 --> 09:19.200
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THE
RIGHT TIME TO TELL YOU

09:19.300 --> 09:21.467
THAT I'M STILL ALIVE.

09:21.567 --> 09:24.701
BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
I COULDN'T WAIT ANY LONGER.

09:24.801 --> 09:29.467
LEXA, WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOU.

09:29.567 --> 09:32.901
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO FACE IT.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.968
IT REALLY IS YOU,
ISN'T IT?

09:37.067 --> 09:39.067
ONLY ADAM KANE WOULD BE
ARROGANT ENOUGH

09:39.167 --> 09:42.667
TO SHOW UP HERE AFTER
A YEAR WITH ADVICE...

09:42.767 --> 09:44.267
INSTEAD OF APOLOGIES.

09:44.367 --> 09:45.234
LEXA.

09:45.334 --> 09:46.434
YOU PICKED A LOUSY TIME

09:46.534 --> 09:48.534
TO GO ALL "GHOST OF
CHRISTMAS PAST" ON ME, ADAM.

09:48.634 --> 09:50.300
YOU TOLD ME YOU WOULD
HANDLE THIS AND YOU FAILED.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.200
DON'T YOU DARE EXPECT
ME TO TRUST YOU NOW.

09:53.300 --> 09:55.534
YOU'RE THINKING WITH
YOUR ANGER AGAIN.

09:55.634 --> 09:57.400
IT'S A MISTAKE.

09:57.501 --> 09:58.501
YEAH?

09:58.601 --> 10:01.400
SO WAS WAITING A YEAR
TO CONTACT US.

10:04.033 --> 10:05.767
WELCOME TO PROJECT NINE.

10:05.868 --> 10:07.067
WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT THING?

10:07.167 --> 10:08.367
IT'S A NEURAL JACK.

10:08.467 --> 10:09.834
IT HIGHJACKS LEXA'S
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM,

10:09.934 --> 10:12.167
GIVES SOMEBODY COMPLETE
REMOTE CONTROL OVER HER.

10:12.267 --> 10:13.934
OH, GREAT.

10:14.033 --> 10:16.167
MAN, SHE'S A FIRECRACKER
ON A GOOD DAY.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.901
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO
BE ABLE TO TRUST HER NOW?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.567
SO ECKHART DID THIS?

10:20.667 --> 10:21.901
SHE TRIED LEAVING THE G.S.A.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.968
AFTER WHAT ECKHART
DID TO HER BROTHER.

10:24.067 --> 10:26.801
THAT WAS HER PUNISHMENT.

10:26.901 --> 10:28.234
WE GOTTA GET IT OUT OF HER.

10:28.334 --> 10:30.968
I DON'T THINK I CAN.

10:31.067 --> 10:33.033
ADAM WORKED ON THE
PROBLEM FOR YEARS.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.000
RAN DOZENS OF DIFFERENT
EXTRACTION SCENARIOS.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.734
IN 97% OF THEM SHE DIED.

10:38.834 --> 10:41.234
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

10:46.300 --> 10:48.367
CAN'T TALK, JESS.
I'M IN A HURRY.

10:48.467 --> 10:52.801
WE KNOW ABOUT
PROJECT NINE.

10:52.901 --> 10:54.567
WE DON'T BLAME YOU.

10:54.667 --> 10:58.033
NONE OF THIS IS
ANY OF YOUR FAULT.

10:58.133 --> 10:59.000
OH.

10:59.100 --> 11:00.567
WELL, THANKS.

11:00.667 --> 11:03.200
DON'T THANK ME YET.

11:08.267 --> 11:09.501
DON'T DO THIS, JESS.

11:09.601 --> 11:10.801
COME ON!

11:10.901 --> 11:12.200
I GOTTA.

11:12.300 --> 11:13.501
YOU'RE A WEAPON AS LONG AS
SOMEBODY'S CONTROLLING YOU,

11:13.601 --> 11:14.801
AND I CAN'T LET YOU OUT

11:14.901 --> 11:16.901
UNTIL WE GET THEIR
FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.601
YEAH.

11:27.601 --> 11:29.400
AGH!

11:29.501 --> 11:31.834
JESSE!

11:52.601 --> 11:54.901
ALL RIGHT, IT TOOK FOUR
DOCTORS TO CREATE PROJECT NINE.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.434
BUT THE ONLY ONES WHO
KNOW HOW IT WORKS

11:56.534 --> 11:58.267
ARE ALL MISSING AS
OF A FEW DAYS AGO.

11:58.367 --> 11:59.501
WHAT, ARE THEY DEAD?

11:59.601 --> 12:01.467
WELL, HOPEFULLY
THEY'RE IN HIDING.

12:01.567 --> 12:04.501
NOW, WE KNOW THAT AT LEAST ONE
OF THEM IS CONTROLLING HER.

12:04.601 --> 12:05.701
AND ARNOT IS
DEFINITELY DEAD,

12:05.801 --> 12:07.634
SO THAT LEAVES US WITH
THREE POSSIBILITIES.

12:07.734 --> 12:09.000
RIGHT.

12:09.100 --> 12:10.634
GUYS, I'M HOPING TO HELL
THAT ONE OF THEM KNOWS

12:10.734 --> 12:13.133
HOW TO GET THIS THING
OUT OF HER NECK.

12:13.234 --> 12:14.968
OKAY.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.300
CALL ME OLD-FASHIONED.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.000
I SAY WE START WITH THE LADY.

12:18.100 --> 12:19.434
NAME IS DR. BEATRICE LANG.

12:19.534 --> 12:20.834
SHE'S THE TECHIE OF THE GROUP

12:20.934 --> 12:23.133
RESPONSIBLE FOR ENGINEERING
THE IMPLANT ITSELF.

12:23.234 --> 12:26.000
I SAY WE MAKE A HOUSE CALL.

12:45.734 --> 12:47.634
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING?

12:47.734 --> 12:49.901
YEAH.
HOW 'BOUT OUT?

12:50.000 --> 12:54.534
I'M WORKING ON THAT.

12:54.634 --> 12:58.300
IS IT EVEN WORTH
SAYING I'M SORRY?

12:58.400 --> 13:02.334
JUST WORDS, JESS.

13:04.534 --> 13:09.100
YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP ME?

13:09.200 --> 13:13.200
GET THIS THING OUT OF ME.

13:13.300 --> 13:16.434
THEY ATTACHED A SENSOR
TO YOUR IMPLANT.

13:16.534 --> 13:17.834
ANY ATTEMPT TO REMOVE IT,

13:17.934 --> 13:20.534
AND IT SENDS AN ELECTRICAL
SURGE INTO YOUR BRAIN -

13:20.634 --> 13:23.734
IMMEDIATE HEMORRHAGE.

13:23.834 --> 13:26.033
I WISH THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY.

13:26.133 --> 13:28.567
WELL, FIND ONE.

13:28.667 --> 13:29.667
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:29.767 --> 13:31.300
I'D RATHER BE DEAD
THAN SOMEBODY'S PUPPET.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.334
LEXA...

13:32.434 --> 13:35.000
MY LIFE. MY RISK.

13:37.367 --> 13:39.200
YEAH.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.868
DR. LANG?

13:45.968 --> 13:49.234
HELLO?

13:51.968 --> 13:54.300
DR. LANG?

14:01.067 --> 14:02.901
AIN'T NOBODY HOME.

14:03.767 --> 14:06.234
SHE'S HOME.

14:13.334 --> 14:15.400
DR. LANG?

14:26.701 --> 14:28.601
DID YOU BRING YOUR
LIBRARY CARD?

14:33.834 --> 14:35.767
SECRET ROOM?

14:37.767 --> 14:40.200
PANIC ROOM.

14:41.367 --> 14:43.901
TEN BUCKS WHO WAS
MAKING HER PANIC.

14:48.234 --> 14:50.701
OH, DAMN.

14:50.801 --> 14:52.534
WELL, WE FOUND HER.

14:52.634 --> 14:53.734
WHAT DID LEX DO?

14:53.834 --> 14:56.067
VAPOURIZE HER?

14:59.934 --> 15:01.534
SHE'S A FEW DAYS OLD.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.567
LEX MUST'VE KILLED
HER FIRST.

15:03.667 --> 15:04.968
OH, YEAH, GREAT.

15:05.067 --> 15:06.968
THEN COMES BACK TO SANCTUARY
AND CRAWLS BACK INTO BED.

15:07.067 --> 15:08.534
THAT'S NICE.

15:08.634 --> 15:11.234
LUCKY SHE DIDN'T TRY AND
KILL US IN HER SLEEP.

15:11.334 --> 15:14.501
WELL, ONE DOC DOWN,
TWO TO GO.

15:14.601 --> 15:17.534
HOW ABOUT A DYING
DECLARATION?

15:19.200 --> 15:21.400
DR. JOHN GONZALES.

15:22.634 --> 15:27.334
OKAY... YOU READY FOR THIS?

15:27.434 --> 15:29.901
YEAH. ME EITHER.

15:45.868 --> 15:48.234
HERE WE GO.

15:49.868 --> 15:52.067
COMPUTER,
VOICE MODE ACTIVATED.

15:52.167 --> 15:53.601
BEGINNING PROCEDURE.

15:53.701 --> 15:56.801
3:26 A.M.

16:00.167 --> 16:03.133
CAUTERIZING
SEVERED ATTACHMENTS.

16:11.167 --> 16:13.234
<gasps>

16:14.667 --> 16:15.434
WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:15.534 --> 16:16.801
WHAT'S GOING WRONG?

16:16.901 --> 16:20.467
<i>IMPLANT DEFENCE MECHANISMS
<i>HAVE BEEN ACTIVATED.</i></i>

16:20.567 --> 16:22.634
<i>HEART RATE FALLING.</i>

16:22.734 --> 16:25.200
<i>BLOOD PRESSURE, 40 OVER 20.</i>

16:25.300 --> 16:27.100
COME ON, DON'T DO THIS. COME ON!

16:27.200 --> 16:29.934
<i>HEART RATE CRITICAL.</i>

16:30.033 --> 16:33.467
<i>COMPLETE LOSS OF
<i>NEURAL FUNCTION.</i></i>

16:33.567 --> 16:36.634
COME ON...

16:36.734 --> 16:41.968
<i>TIME OF DEATH, 4:02.</i>

16:55.334 --> 16:56.634
RESET.

16:56.734 --> 16:58.834
<i>RESETTING SIMULATION.</i>

17:08.467 --> 17:10.934
YOUR FINAL REPORT?

17:11.032 --> 17:13.300
NO CHANGES.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.334
THERE WERE NO SURVIVORS OF
THE MAXXLON LAB BREAK-IN.

17:16.434 --> 17:18.300
THE VIDEO SYSTEM WAS DISABLED,

17:18.400 --> 17:20.467
THE TRAIL OF ARNOT'S
KILLER IS COLD.

17:20.567 --> 17:22.233
UNACCEPTABLE.

17:22.334 --> 17:23.901
YOU KNOW THE SITUATION.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.666
THE THREAT THIS
REPRESENTS TO US.

17:26.767 --> 17:28.801
PERHAPS EVEN TO THE CREATOR.

17:28.901 --> 17:30.467
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO
LET THIS GO BY...

17:30.567 --> 17:34.634
NEITHER CAN WE ASSUME THAT
THESE ATTACKS ON US WILL STOP.

17:34.734 --> 17:38.667
SO, WE'RE AGREED?

17:40.868 --> 17:42.734
WE'RE MOVING TO THE NEXT PHASE.

17:42.834 --> 17:44.901
HAND OVER WHAT INFORMATION
YOU'VE GATHERED.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.701
THIS ISN'T NECESSARY.

17:46.801 --> 17:47.934
GIVE ME TIME.

17:48.033 --> 17:49.467
THE KILLER WILL BE FOUND...

17:49.567 --> 17:51.234
AND EXECUTED.

17:51.334 --> 17:54.467
WE'RE ASSIGNING THE FIXERS.

18:06.801 --> 18:08.801
THERE'S THREE HUNDRED
FEET OF ROCK ABOVE YOU.

18:08.901 --> 18:11.467
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE
THAT KIND OF TIME.

18:11.567 --> 18:13.334
IF YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP
POPPING UP LIKE THIS

18:13.434 --> 18:15.234
YOU REALLY SHOULD
START WEARING A BELL.

18:15.334 --> 18:16.634
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN I
FIRST BROUGHT YOU HERE,

18:16.734 --> 18:17.968
I TOLD YOU THERE WAS
A POINT AT WHICH

18:18.067 --> 18:20.968
YOUR INDEPENDENCE
BECAME A LIABILITY.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.968
THE SAFEST PLACE FOR
YOU IS RIGHT IN HERE.

18:24.067 --> 18:25.701
LET THE OTHERS HANDLE THIS.

18:25.801 --> 18:28.634
YOU GAVE UP THE RIGHT TO ADVISE
US WHEN YOU ABANDONED MUTANT X.

18:28.734 --> 18:29.968
I DIDN'T ABANDON ANYTHING.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.467
REALLY?

18:31.567 --> 18:32.801
THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH
HELL THIS PAST YEAR.

18:32.901 --> 18:36.434
WHERE WERE YOU?

18:36.534 --> 18:39.634
I'M SORRY THAT I COULDN'T
HAVE BEEN HERE FOR YOU

18:39.734 --> 18:43.300
WHEN YOUR BROTHER PASSED AWAY.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.767
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF GAME
YOU'RE PLAYING HERE, ADAM.

18:45.868 --> 18:47.567
BUT MUTANT X DOESN'T
NEED YOU ANYMORE.

18:47.667 --> 18:49.400
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I NEVER DID.

18:49.501 --> 18:52.868
ALL THAT MATTERS TO ME
IS THAT YOU NEED THEM.

18:52.968 --> 18:55.133
I WORKED BACK CHANNELS TO
HAVE YOU INSERTED HERE,

18:55.234 --> 18:57.300
NOT SO YOU COULD SAVE THEM,
SO THEY COULD SAVE YOU

18:57.400 --> 19:00.701
FROM WHO YOU WERE BECOMING.

19:00.801 --> 19:04.000
WELL, YOU WASTED YOUR TIME.

19:04.100 --> 19:06.133
THANKS TO THIS THING, I'M
BACK TO MY OLD TRICKS.

19:06.234 --> 19:08.567
THERE'S A CHANCE
WE CAN CHANGE THAT.

19:08.667 --> 19:12.534
JESSE LIED TO YOU.

19:12.634 --> 19:14.200
HE LET HIS FEELINGS FOR
YOU CLOUD HIS JUDGEMENT.

19:14.300 --> 19:16.234
THERE IS A CHANCE,
A SMALL CHANCE

19:16.334 --> 19:18.167
THAT I CAN REMOVE THE
IMPLANT, ALL RIGHT?

19:18.267 --> 19:22.300
BUT - IT'S VERY RISKY.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.434
AND YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.

19:24.534 --> 19:29.033
DO ME A FAVOUR:
HOLD YOUR BREATH ON THAT ONE.

19:29.133 --> 19:30.767
OKAY. FINE.

19:30.868 --> 19:33.667
I CAN'T FORCE YOU
TO LET ME HELP.

19:33.767 --> 19:37.734
BUT THE OFFER STILL STANDS.

19:49.834 --> 19:51.434
<i>MR. KILMARTIN.</i>

19:51.534 --> 19:53.033
WHAT...? WHO...?
HOW DID YOU...?

19:53.133 --> 19:57.133
<i>NO TIME FOR
<i>ELOQUENT QUESTIONS.</i></i>

19:57.234 --> 19:58.634
WHAT IS THAT?

19:58.734 --> 20:02.000
<i>PROFILES ON EACH OF THE DOCTORS
<i>RESPONSIBLE FOR LEXA'S IMPLANT.</i></i>

20:02.100 --> 20:04.667
<i>IT'S THE LAST HELP
<i>I CAN OFFER HER.</i></i>

20:04.767 --> 20:06.033
<i>I HOPE IT'S ENOUGH.</i>

20:06.133 --> 20:07.534
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

20:07.634 --> 20:09.601
<i>IF LEXA TAKES ANY FURTHER
<i>ACTIONS AGAINST THE DOMINION,</i></i>

20:09.701 --> 20:12.200
<i>I WON'T BE ABLE TO
<i>HIDE IT FROM THEM.</i></i>

20:12.300 --> 20:14.567
<i>IN PLAIN ENGLISH,
<i>MR. KILMARTIN,</i></i>

20:14.667 --> 20:16.334
<i>SHE WILL BE TERMINATED.</i>

20:16.434 --> 20:18.267
ALL RIGHT, NOW YOU
GO TELL THE DOMINION

20:18.367 --> 20:20.167
THAT IF THEY GO NEAR LEXA
OR ANY MEMBER OF MY TEAM,

20:20.267 --> 20:23.601
THEN I WILL BECOME A
THREAT TO THEIR SURVIVAL.

20:27.934 --> 20:29.701
LEXA!

20:38.701 --> 20:40.300
LEXA!

20:40.400 --> 20:43.968
LEXA! CAN YOU HEAR ME?

20:44.067 --> 20:47.000
LEXA?

20:47.100 --> 20:49.801
LEXA.

20:49.901 --> 20:52.100
LEXA, WAKE UP.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.734
WAKE UP! COME ON!

20:53.834 --> 20:54.734
WHAT HAPPENED?

20:54.834 --> 20:56.000
I DON'T KNOW.

20:56.100 --> 20:57.167
UH, THE IMPLANT MUST'VE
OVERLOADED YOU SOMEHOW.

20:57.267 --> 20:58.767
ARE YOU OKAY?

20:58.868 --> 21:00.901
NO, JESS, I'M NOT.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.334
HAVING SOMEONE INSIDE MY HEAD,

21:02.434 --> 21:04.400
KNOWING HE CAN
MAKE ME DO WHATEVER HE WANTS...

21:04.501 --> 21:06.300
I REFUSE TO BE THAT POWERLESS.

21:06.400 --> 21:07.601
I WON'T.

21:07.701 --> 21:11.801
HEY, YOU'RE ABOUT THE LEAST
POWERLESS WOMAN I KNOW.

21:11.901 --> 21:13.200
ANY MORE POWERFUL I'LL
HAVE TO BUY YOU A CAPE.

21:13.300 --> 21:15.868
<laugh>

21:16.701 --> 21:17.934
LET ME OUT OF HERE, JESS.

21:18.033 --> 21:20.567
I CAN'T.

21:20.667 --> 21:23.100
LOOK, I JUST SPOKE TO YOUR
CONTACT WITH THE DOMINION.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.200
IF YOU ATTACK AND GET
CAUGHT ONE MORE TIME...

21:25.300 --> 21:26.501
I KNOW. THEY'LL KILL ME.

21:26.601 --> 21:27.734
YEAH.

21:27.834 --> 21:30.801
I'M WAY TOO DANGEROUS
FOR THEM LIKE THIS.

21:30.901 --> 21:32.434
THEY'LL FIND OUT EVENTUALLY,

21:32.534 --> 21:33.701
SO I GUESS
DEAD IF YOU DO,

21:33.801 --> 21:34.734
DEAD IF YOU DON'T.

21:34.834 --> 21:37.834
HEY, I'M NEVER GOING
TO LET THAT HAPPEN.

21:56.133 --> 21:58.868
WHAT WAS THAT?

21:58.968 --> 22:01.467
THAT WAS GOODBYE.

22:03.100 --> 22:05.400
UGH...!

22:07.701 --> 22:09.667
LEXA!
DON'T BE STUPID!

22:09.767 --> 22:11.968
SORRY, JESS, I HAVE
TO DO THIS MYSELF.

22:12.067 --> 22:14.000
AGH!

22:14.100 --> 22:15.767
LEXA!

22:18.467 --> 22:20.501
LEXA, COME BACK!

22:29.267 --> 22:33.701
<grunting>

22:47.334 --> 22:48.834
AGH!

23:07.434 --> 23:09.868
ALL RIGHT,
HERE GOES SOMETHING.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.567
AGH!

23:15.434 --> 23:16.200
UGH!

23:16.300 --> 23:18.300
<i>JESS, WHERE ARE YOU, MAN?</i>

23:18.400 --> 23:20.501
I'M A LITTLE BIT BUSY RIGHT NOW.

23:20.601 --> 23:21.701
DR. LANG IS DEAD.

23:21.801 --> 23:23.634
WE THINK GONSALVES
IS OUR KILLER.

23:23.734 --> 23:27.400
WELL, THEN WE
GOT BIG PROBLEMS.

23:27.501 --> 23:29.701
LEXA'S TURNED
AND ON THE RUN.

23:29.801 --> 23:32.367
OKAY, I NEED YOU TO STOP HER
BEFORE SHE GETS TO HOWELL.

23:32.467 --> 23:34.834
HE WAS THE SURGICAL
SPECIALIST OF THE TEAM.

23:34.934 --> 23:37.334
IF ANYBODY CAN GET THIS
OUT OF HER NECK, IT'S HIM.

23:37.434 --> 23:38.567
HE'S OUR LAST SHOT.

23:38.667 --> 23:39.801
YEAH, WELL, HOLD ON, JESS.

23:39.901 --> 23:41.067
STOP HER HOW?

23:41.167 --> 23:42.767
I MEAN, ASSUMING WE
CAN EVEN FIND HER.

23:42.868 --> 23:44.200
OKAY, I GOT AN IDEA,

23:44.300 --> 23:47.067
BUT I NEED YOU TO CHECK OUT
THE MED KIT IN THE HELIX.

23:50.601 --> 23:51.534
<Shal>
<i>GOT IT.</i>

23:51.634 --> 23:52.701
OKAY, GOOD.

23:52.801 --> 23:54.033
NOW TELL ME WHAT
DRUGS YOU SEE.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.501
UM...

23:55.601 --> 23:57.667
WE GOT CORTISOL...

23:57.767 --> 24:00.133
CODEINE, MORPHINE,
EPINEPHRINE...

24:00.234 --> 24:01.234
EPINEPHRINE!

24:01.334 --> 24:02.834
EPINEPHRINE,
OKAY, THAT'S GOOD.

24:02.934 --> 24:04.667
WHEN GONSALVES
ACTIVATES THE IMPLANT,

24:04.767 --> 24:06.767
IT PUTS LEXA
INTO A <i>REM TRANCE.</i>

24:06.868 --> 24:08.501
EPINEPHRINE SHOULD SNAP
HER OUT OF THAT TRANCE

24:08.601 --> 24:11.334
LONG ENOUGH TO WAKE HER UP
- AT LEAST TEMPORARILY.

24:11.434 --> 24:13.234
WELL, WE STILL NEED A
LOCATION ON HER, BUD...

24:13.334 --> 24:15.133
<i>RIGHT. UH...</i>

24:15.234 --> 24:16.567
OKAY, WELL, LET'S JUST
HOPE THAT GONSALVES

24:16.667 --> 24:19.567
DOESN'T KNOW ENOUGH TO TELL
HER TAKE OFF HER COMLINK RING.

24:41.868 --> 24:43.133
LITTLE HELP HERE, JESS?

24:43.234 --> 24:45.033
UH, YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.

24:45.133 --> 24:47.834
TAKE YOUR NEXT HALL, LEFT.

24:50.334 --> 24:52.133
WELL, SHE'S HERE.

24:52.234 --> 24:54.200
MUST'VE JUST MISSED HER.

24:57.300 --> 24:58.367
FREEZE!

24:58.467 --> 25:00.367
DON'T MOVE!

25:00.467 --> 25:01.434
CAN YOU GET THIS?

25:01.534 --> 25:02.667
OH, YEAH.

25:02.767 --> 25:04.567
I SAID FREEZE!

25:04.667 --> 25:07.067
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THE ODDS HERE, BOYS.

25:13.901 --> 25:16.133
HARDLY SEEMS FAIR.

25:27.901 --> 25:30.100
GET BACK TO WORK!

25:36.501 --> 25:38.367
LEXA, DON'T DO IT.

25:38.467 --> 25:40.667
NO, NO... DON'T!

25:43.234 --> 25:45.701
YOU JUST KILLED THE ONLY
CHANCE WE HAVE OF FIXING YOU.

25:45.801 --> 25:47.834
I'M WORKING JUST FINE.

25:49.534 --> 25:51.267
SEE?

26:29.167 --> 26:31.734
JESS, WE'RE
BRINGING HER HOME.

26:36.868 --> 26:40.067
JESSE, WE HAVE TO DO THIS.

26:40.167 --> 26:41.501
ADAM, YOU GOT A
HABIT OF TURNING UP

26:41.601 --> 26:43.567
WHEN I LEAST
WANT TO SEE YOU.

26:43.667 --> 26:45.033
YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE TOLD HER.

26:45.133 --> 26:47.167
YOU KNEW THAT SHE'D
WANT TO TAKE THE RISK.

26:47.267 --> 26:48.734
IT'S HERS TO TAKE.

26:48.834 --> 26:53.601
JESSE, CARING FOR SOMEONE MEANS
TELLING THEM ALL TRUTHS,

26:53.701 --> 26:56.133
EVEN THE ONES YOU WANT
TO PROTECT THEM FROM.

26:56.234 --> 26:57.501
TOOK ME A LONG
TIME TO LEARN THAT.

26:57.601 --> 26:59.067
BUT YOU STILL HAVEN'T.

26:59.167 --> 27:00.434
YOU WANT TO HELP?

27:00.534 --> 27:02.133
TRY PUTTING
YOURSELF OUT THERE.

27:06.701 --> 27:08.868
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING.

27:08.968 --> 27:12.000
OH, MY GOD.

27:12.100 --> 27:13.934
YOU'RE REALLY HERE THIS TIME.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.968
THIS TIME?

27:17.067 --> 27:21.667
YEAH WELL, I GUESS WE'RE
ALL REALLY GOOD AT KEEPING
YOUR SECRETS, HUH?

27:21.767 --> 27:23.634
WHY NOW?

27:23.734 --> 27:25.901
LEXA.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.434
THE SURGICAL PROCEDURE.

27:28.534 --> 27:31.667
YOU'RE THINKING THAT IT'LL
WORK WITH THE TWO OF US.

27:31.767 --> 27:33.634
WELL, COME ON. WILL IT?
ARE YOU SURE?

27:33.734 --> 27:35.667
I'M SURE IT'S HER ONLY CHANCE.

27:35.767 --> 27:37.667
TRUST ME.

27:37.767 --> 27:40.567
WELL, THAT'S THE
ISSUE, ISN'T IT?

27:42.868 --> 27:44.234
NOW?

27:44.334 --> 27:45.701
I SEE SPOTS.

27:45.801 --> 27:47.801
THAT'S THE OCCIPITAL LOBE.

27:50.100 --> 27:51.601
KEEP TALKING.

27:51.701 --> 27:54.467
THERE ONCE WAS A MAN
FROM NANTUCKET...

27:56.667 --> 27:59.200
OKAY, AND TWO...

27:59.300 --> 28:00.567
OH, HER HANDS MOVED.

28:00.667 --> 28:01.534
THAT'S THE UH...

28:01.634 --> 28:03.200
THE... THE GROSS MOTOR.

28:03.300 --> 28:05.100
IT'S THE PRECENTRAL GYRUS.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.901
IT'S JUST IN FRONT
OF THE PARIETAL LOBE.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.067
ALL RIGHT. GOOD.

28:09.167 --> 28:11.767
SO WE HAVE THE SURGICAL
AREA COMPLETELY MAPPED.

28:11.868 --> 28:14.267
NOW, I THINK THAT WE SHOULD
DO THIS IN TWO PHASES.

28:14.367 --> 28:18.601
FIRST, WE SHOULD NEUTRALIZE
THE IMPLANT HARDWARE.

28:18.701 --> 28:22.234
SO THAT IT DOESN'T SELF-DESTRUCT
WHEN IT SENSES OUR INTRUSION,

28:22.334 --> 28:24.801
WE NEUTRALIZE IT HERE.

28:24.901 --> 28:27.834
AND THEN WE CAN COMPLETELY
SEVER IT FROM THE NERVE HERE.

28:27.934 --> 28:30.734
NOW WE BOTH REMEMBER THAT
I'M NOT A DOCTOR, RIGHT?

28:30.834 --> 28:31.834
RIGHT.

28:31.934 --> 28:33.100
WELL, WE'RE BOTH A
LITTLE OVER OUR HEADS HERE

28:33.200 --> 28:34.567
SO I'VE UPLOADED THE
PROCEDURAL SPECS

28:34.667 --> 28:36.534
SO THAT THE COMPUTER
CAN GIVE US A HAND.

28:36.634 --> 28:37.868
GREAT.

28:37.968 --> 28:39.200
JUST REMEMBER THAT
ONCE WE BEGIN

28:39.300 --> 28:40.601
WE HAVE LESS THAN
THIRTY-FIVE MINUTES

28:40.701 --> 28:43.601
TO COMPLETE THE
ENTIRE PROCEDURE.

28:47.334 --> 28:50.000
YOU READY?

28:52.767 --> 28:53.901
I'LL START AT THE SOURCE.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.467
YOU CAUTERIZE
THE CONNECTIONS.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.601
ALL RIGHT.

29:00.367 --> 29:04.100
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S BEGIN.

29:06.300 --> 29:08.367
HANG IN THERE, LEXA.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.434
JESS?

29:18.534 --> 29:22.300
IF THIS DOESN'T WORK,
KILL GONSALVES FOR ME.

29:22.400 --> 29:25.968
DON'T WORRY... YOU
CAN KILL HIM YOURSELF.

29:42.501 --> 29:44.000
SHAL, LEXA'S
GOING TO BE FINE.

29:44.100 --> 29:46.033
WE'RE ALL FIGHTING
FOR HER NOW.

29:46.133 --> 29:48.400
SOMETIMES THAT
ISN'T ENOUGH.

29:48.501 --> 29:49.634
WELL, I THINK WE
SHOULD BE WORRIED

29:49.734 --> 29:51.334
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS
AFTER THE SURGERY.

29:51.434 --> 29:54.200
JESS SAID THE DOMINION SENT A
BUNCH OF ASSASSINS AFTER HER.

29:54.300 --> 29:56.534
WHAT?

29:56.634 --> 29:59.100
AND THEY THINK WE'RE JUST
GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN?

29:59.200 --> 30:00.968
THEY THINK IT'S THE
ONLY WAY TO STOP HER.

30:01.067 --> 30:03.100
JESS SAID THAT THEY
WON'T BEND ON IT.

30:03.200 --> 30:06.067
YEAH, WE'LL SEE
ABOUT THAT.

30:07.100 --> 30:11.634
<gasping>

30:11.734 --> 30:14.534
WE HAVE
TO WORK QUICKLY.

30:21.167 --> 30:22.901
<i>OUR HANDS ARE TIED.</i>

30:23.000 --> 30:24.534
<i>LEXA IS A THREAT TO US.</i>

30:24.634 --> 30:26.267
SHE'S RISKED HER LIFE
FOR YOU COUNTLESS TIMES.

30:26.367 --> 30:27.968
YOU OWE HER MORE THAN THIS.

30:28.067 --> 30:30.100
ALL WE'RE ASKING IS THAT
YOU CALL OFF YOUR DOGS.

30:30.200 --> 30:33.067
<i>THE ASSASSINS ARE
<i>ALREADY ON HER TRAIL.</i></i>

30:33.167 --> 30:35.033
<i>YOU ARE THE ONES WHO LET
<i>LEXA OUT TO KILL AGAIN,</i></i>

30:35.133 --> 30:36.734
<i>LEAVING PROOF OF HER CRIMES.</i>

30:36.834 --> 30:38.601
<i>IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO
<i>ASSIGN BLAME HERE,</i></i>

30:38.701 --> 30:40.033
<i>LOOK TO YOURSELVES.</i>

30:40.133 --> 30:41.534
THEN MEET US HALF WAY,
ALL RIGHT?

30:41.634 --> 30:42.767
BUY US SOME TIME.

30:42.868 --> 30:44.834
WE'VE ALREADY STARTED
TO REMOVE THE IMPLANT.

30:44.934 --> 30:46.901
SHE WASN'T IN
CONTROL OF HERSELF.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.601
<i>AND I AM NOT IN
<i>CONTROL OF THEM.</i></i>

30:49.701 --> 30:52.634
<i>I CANNOT STOP THIS.</i>

30:57.067 --> 30:58.100
ALL RIGHT, JESSE, GOOD.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.601
BUT WE HAVE TO
KEEP UP THE PACE.

30:59.701 --> 31:02.067
THE INPUT AND THE OUTPUT
ENDS HAVE TO BE HANDLED
SIMULTANEOUSLY.

31:02.167 --> 31:03.601
ADAM, IT'S BUILDING
UP TOO FAST.

31:03.701 --> 31:04.834
STAY CALM.

31:04.934 --> 31:06.434
WE CAN DO THIS.

31:06.534 --> 31:08.033
COMPUTER,
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

31:08.133 --> 31:09.167
STATUS?

31:09.267 --> 31:11.801
<i>APPROACHING NERVOUS
<i>SYSTEM OVERLOAD.</i></i>

31:11.901 --> 31:13.133
ADAM, WHAT DO WE DO?

31:13.234 --> 31:14.300
STAY CALM.

31:14.400 --> 31:15.934
IT'S NOT WORKING.

31:16.033 --> 31:17.467
<i>BLOOD PRESSURE FALLING.</i>

31:17.567 --> 31:18.534
THE IMPLANT
HAS DETECTED US.

31:18.634 --> 31:21.767
IT'S FLOODING
HER SYNAPSES.

31:21.868 --> 31:23.734
IT'S KILLING HER!

31:23.834 --> 31:27.334
<gasps>

31:30.000 --> 31:31.667
ADAM, THIS IS WHAT
HAPPENED BEFORE.

31:31.767 --> 31:32.868
WE'RE LOSING HER.

31:32.968 --> 31:34.634
JESSE, SIT DOWN.

31:34.734 --> 31:35.601
JESSE!

31:35.701 --> 31:36.901
DON'T STOP!

31:37.000 --> 31:38.601
WE GOTTA GET IT
OUT OF HER NOW.

31:38.701 --> 31:40.000
HER SYSTEM CAN
HANDLE THE STRESS.

31:40.100 --> 31:41.200
I'VE BEEN
THROUGH THIS.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.100
IF WE WAIT,
SHE WILL DIE.

31:43.200 --> 31:44.434
JESSE, THIS IS
NOT A SIMULATION.

31:44.534 --> 31:46.701
COMPUTER, SEVER PRIMARY
NERVE CONNECTION NOW.

31:46.801 --> 31:47.834
<i>SEVERING CONNECTION.</i>

31:47.934 --> 31:50.267
COMPUTER, ABORT!

31:50.367 --> 31:51.801
COME ON.

31:51.901 --> 31:53.100
<i>CONNECTION SEVERED.</i>

31:53.200 --> 31:55.667
AH!

32:00.501 --> 32:04.701
<i>CAUTERIZING
<i>INITIALIZED.</i></i>

32:06.767 --> 32:09.167
<i>PROCEDURE SUCCESSFUL.</i>

32:18.834 --> 32:21.334
LEXA, YOU MADE IT.

32:25.701 --> 32:27.033
HOW'D WE DO?

32:27.133 --> 32:29.901
WELL, YOU WEREN'T
MUCH HELP.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.934
BUT WE WERE
UNBELIEVABLE.

32:40.834 --> 32:42.467
WHY ARE YOU LEAVING?

32:42.567 --> 32:45.300
BECAUSE I MADE MYSELF A
TARGET AS SOON AS I CAME HERE.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.200
NOW MY ENEMIES
KNOW I'M ALIVE.

32:47.300 --> 32:48.267
WHAT ABOUT LEXA?

32:48.367 --> 32:49.667
IT'S NOT OVER.

32:49.767 --> 32:51.033
HE DOESN'T CARE.

32:51.133 --> 32:52.167
YOU'RE RIGHT, BRENNAN.

32:52.267 --> 32:53.467
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHY I CAME HERE.

32:53.567 --> 32:56.133
PUTTING MYSELF IN PERSONAL
DANGER BECAUSE I DON'T CARE.

32:56.234 --> 32:59.133
WHAT ABOUT THE DANGER YOU PUT
US IN WHEN YOU ABANDONED US?

32:59.234 --> 33:00.234
YOU WERE READY.

33:00.334 --> 33:01.601
AND YOU WERE SCARED.

33:01.701 --> 33:02.934
WHATEVER WAS GOING
ON, WHATEVER YOUR...

33:03.033 --> 33:05.767
YOUR BIG SECRET WAS, YOU
DIDN'T JUST RUN FROM IT,

33:05.868 --> 33:07.000
YOU RAN FROM US.

33:07.100 --> 33:08.167
AND THAT'S WHAT
I CAN'T FORGIVE.

33:08.267 --> 33:09.000
BRENNAN, STOP IT!

33:09.100 --> 33:10.033
NO.

33:10.133 --> 33:11.400
NO, WE BURIED HIM
AND HE LET US.

33:11.501 --> 33:13.501
THAT'S SICK.

33:14.734 --> 33:15.934
HE DIDN'T MEAN IT.

33:16.033 --> 33:17.400
IT'S OKAY.

33:17.501 --> 33:20.067
ARE WE GOING TO
SEE YOU AGAIN?

33:29.534 --> 33:31.501
IF I'M LUCKY.

33:37.734 --> 33:40.701
I THINK OUR ONLY HOPE IS TO
TRY TO TAKE DOWN GONSALVES.

33:40.801 --> 33:43.868
SHOW THE DOMINION THAT LEXA'S
AT LEAST USEFUL TO THEM.

33:43.968 --> 33:45.267
YEAH, BUT WE DON'T
HAVE ANY LEADS

33:45.367 --> 33:46.834
AND WE DON'T
HAVE ANY TIME.

33:46.934 --> 33:48.434
BOY, YOU GUYS REALLY
DO GIVE UP EASY.

33:48.534 --> 33:49.434
WELL...

33:49.534 --> 33:50.501
NO, NO, NO... YOU
SHOULD BE IN BED.

33:50.601 --> 33:52.367
I WAS.

33:52.467 --> 33:55.234
UNTIL THIS WOKE ME.

33:55.334 --> 33:57.400
GUESS WHO'S TRYING TO REACH
OUT AND TOUCH SOMEBODY.

33:57.501 --> 34:00.701
HEY, CAN YOU USE THAT TO TRACE
THE SIGNAL BACK TO GONSALVES?

34:00.801 --> 34:02.667
NOW THAT IT'S OUT
OF HER, HELL, YEAH.

34:02.767 --> 34:04.133
GOOD.

34:04.234 --> 34:05.834
BECAUSE ONCE YOU FIND HIM I'M
COMING ALONG FOR THE CLEANUP.

34:05.934 --> 34:06.968
NO.

34:07.067 --> 34:08.367
NO, YOU'RE TOO WEAK.

34:08.467 --> 34:09.601
YOU NEED SOME
TIME TO HEAL.

34:09.701 --> 34:11.601
NOT UNTIL I MAKE HIM PAY.

34:11.701 --> 34:15.300
AFTER EVERYTHING HE PUT ME
THROUGH, I NEED THIS, SHAL.

34:15.400 --> 34:16.801
OKAY?

34:16.900 --> 34:18.167
THIS IS CRAZY.

34:18.266 --> 34:19.501
THE DOMINION KNOWS AS MUCH
ABOUT THAT IMPLANT AS WE DO.

34:19.601 --> 34:20.634
THEY PROBABLY HAVE
THEIR ASSASSINS

34:20.734 --> 34:21.967
TRACING THE SIGNAL
RIGHT NOW.

34:22.067 --> 34:24.701
SO LET 'EM.

34:24.801 --> 34:27.067
EVERYBODY WANTS
A PIECE OF LEXA?

34:27.167 --> 34:30.967
LET'S MAKE SURE THERE'S
ENOUGH OF HER TO GO AROUND.

35:43.901 --> 35:45.701
IT'S A BIG KNIFE.

35:45.801 --> 35:47.901
COMPENSATING FOR SOMETHING?

35:48.000 --> 35:49.167
YOU TALK TOO MUCH.

35:49.267 --> 35:50.434
YOU KNOW THAT?

35:50.534 --> 35:52.934
LET'S SEE IF I CAN DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

36:20.133 --> 36:21.634
THEY JUST NEVER
WANT TO STAY DOWN.

36:21.734 --> 36:23.100
TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.

36:23.200 --> 36:24.701
YOU'RE GETTIN' RUSTY.

36:24.801 --> 36:26.467
SURE.

36:38.067 --> 36:41.033
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

36:41.133 --> 36:43.000
DID YOU FINISH THE JOB?

36:43.100 --> 36:44.000
YEAH.

36:44.100 --> 36:46.601
ABOUT THAT...

36:46.701 --> 36:49.234
SHE QUIT.

36:49.334 --> 36:51.567
WHO IS THIS?

36:54.267 --> 36:55.734
WHAT DID YOU DO?

36:55.834 --> 36:58.167
OH... SORRY, DOC.

36:58.267 --> 37:01.334
THIS PUPPET'S
CUT HER STRINGS.

37:17.601 --> 37:24.601
<gunshots>

37:24.701 --> 37:26.167
DAMMIT!

37:47.200 --> 37:48.634
DON'T BE RASH, LEXA.

37:48.734 --> 37:51.467
WE CAN STILL ENJOY A
PROFITABLE PARTNERSHIP.

37:51.567 --> 37:53.200
ALL OF US.

37:53.300 --> 37:54.601
I'LL PASS.

37:54.701 --> 37:57.634
BUT I'M ABOUT TO ENJOY THE HELL
OUT OF THE NEXT TEN SECONDS.

38:00.567 --> 38:02.701
YOU SHOULD BE THANKING ME.

38:02.801 --> 38:04.200
WHEN ECKHART FIRST
BROUGHT YOU TO ME

38:04.300 --> 38:06.434
YOU WERE JUST AN
AVERAGE OPERATIVE.

38:06.534 --> 38:10.067
UNDER MY CONTROL YOU WERE
A VIRTUOSO OF VIOLENCE.

38:10.167 --> 38:11.367
I DISAGREE.

38:14.234 --> 38:15.701
AGH!

38:16.534 --> 38:18.133
I WAS NEVER AVERAGE.

38:20.167 --> 38:23.868
TEN POINTS.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.934
FIRST INSTALLMENT
FOR THE DOMINION.

38:26.033 --> 38:28.767
I ALWAYS PAY MY DEBTS.

38:30.701 --> 38:32.701
ALL OF THEM.

38:47.367 --> 38:48.501
IT'S DONE.

38:48.601 --> 38:50.701
LEXA HAS RETURNED TO THE FOLD.

38:50.801 --> 38:52.167
YOU'RE QUITE SURE?

38:52.267 --> 38:53.667
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

38:53.767 --> 38:55.834
THE PIERCE SITUATION
HAS BEEN HANDLED.

38:55.934 --> 38:58.601
THE THREAT TO THE
DOMINION NEUTRALIZED.

38:58.701 --> 39:00.767
NOT YET.

39:00.868 --> 39:04.167
BUT IT WILL BE.

39:10.100 --> 39:12.133
BRENNAN WAS RIGHT.

39:12.234 --> 39:14.400
I ABANDONED YOU.

39:14.501 --> 39:17.133
BUT I HAD MY REASONS.

39:17.234 --> 39:19.267
AND IT'S TIME THAT
YOU HEARD THEM.

39:19.367 --> 39:21.567
WE'RE LISTENING.

39:23.601 --> 39:25.567
DURING THE LAST YEAR
THAT WE WERE TOGETHER,

39:25.667 --> 39:27.934
I BECAME AWARE OF
CERTAIN FACTIONS

39:28.033 --> 39:30.601
THAT WERE WORKING
AGAINST US.

39:30.701 --> 39:33.234
BUT I WASN'T QUITE
SURE WHO OUR ENEMY WAS

39:33.334 --> 39:37.434
UNTIL RECENT EVENTS
CONFIRMED MY SUSPICIONS.

39:37.534 --> 39:43.367
OUR ENEMY
IS THE DOMINION.

39:43.467 --> 39:46.033
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

39:46.133 --> 39:48.834
ALL THE PLAGUES
THAT YOU'VE STOPPED,

39:48.934 --> 39:52.534
ALL THE GENETIC RESEARCH THAT
YOU'VE GATHERED FOR THEM,

39:52.634 --> 39:55.567
THERE'S A FACTION
WITHIN THE DOMINION

39:55.667 --> 39:57.334
THAT HAS BEEN
DIVERTING ALL OF THIS

39:57.434 --> 39:59.734
FOR THEIR OWN
SECRET AGENDA.

39:59.834 --> 40:01.067
YOU MEAN FOR THIS PAST YEAR

40:01.167 --> 40:04.100
WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING
FOR THE WRONG SIDE?

40:04.200 --> 40:06.200
ADAM, HOW COULD
YOU LET US DO THAT?

40:06.300 --> 40:08.133
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
KNOW THE WHOLE TRUTH.

40:08.234 --> 40:11.133
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
DEEP THE CORRUPTION WENT.

40:11.234 --> 40:12.934
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
KNOW WHO TO TRUST.

40:13.033 --> 40:14.701
YOU MEAN ME?

40:14.801 --> 40:17.801
YOU WEREN'T SURE IF
YOU COULD TRUST ME?

40:20.434 --> 40:23.334
SO WHY COME
BACK AT ALL?

40:23.434 --> 40:26.734
YOU SAY HOW THE SECRECY'S
BEEN FOR OUR OWN GOOD.

40:26.834 --> 40:29.334
HE NEEDS
SOMETHING FROM US.

40:29.434 --> 40:31.267
DON'T YOU?

40:34.133 --> 40:37.133
THIS YEAR'S BEEN
HARD ON ALL OF US.

40:37.234 --> 40:39.300
BUT MUTANT X HASN'T
JUST SURVIVED.

40:39.400 --> 40:41.601
YOU'VE THRIVED.

40:41.701 --> 40:44.267
AND I COME TO YOU NOW
BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE READY.

40:44.367 --> 40:46.367
READY FOR WHAT?

40:46.467 --> 40:49.000
FOR WAR.

40:49.100 --> 40:50.567
THIS NEW FACE
OF THE DOMINION

40:50.667 --> 40:53.167
THREATENS EVERYTHING
WE STAND FOR.

40:53.267 --> 40:55.234
EVERYTHING WE'VE EVER STOOD FOR.

40:55.334 --> 40:58.200
FORGET ASHLOCKE,
YOU CAN FORGET ECKHART.

40:58.300 --> 41:02.601
THIS WOULD BE A WAR UNLIKE
ANY WAR WE'VE EVER FOUGHT.

41:02.701 --> 41:07.033
MAYBE A WAR THAT I'M NOT
EVEN SURE THAT WE COULD WIN.

41:07.133 --> 41:13.367
BUT I AM SURE THAT I DON'T
CONTROL MUTANT X ANY MORE.

41:13.467 --> 41:16.167
SO, IT'S UP TO YOU.

41:18.434 --> 41:22.367
WHAT IF WE SAY YES?

41:22.467 --> 41:27.200
AS LONG AS I'M ON THE
RUN YOU'RE NOT THE FOCUS.

41:27.300 --> 41:30.667
BY MAKING MYSELF A TARGET,

41:30.767 --> 41:32.868
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
THAT I CAN PROTECT YOU.

41:32.968 --> 41:34.868
ADAM, THERE'S GOT
TO BE ANOTHER WAY.

41:34.968 --> 41:36.667
THERE ISN'T.

41:36.767 --> 41:38.434
I JUST FOUND YOU.

41:38.534 --> 41:40.701
I CAN'T LOSE YOU AGAIN.

41:40.801 --> 41:42.601
YOU WON'T.

41:44.834 --> 41:51.300
LOOK, LEAVING MUTANT X WAS THE
HARDEST THING I'VE EVER DONE.

41:51.400 --> 41:53.567

MY LIFE'S WORK.

41:53.667 --> 41:55.701
YOU'RE MY LIFE.

41:58.834 --> 42:03.167
AND I'LL RISK EVERYTHING
TO PROTECT YOU.
