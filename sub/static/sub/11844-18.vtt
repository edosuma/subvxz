00:02.302 --> 00:05.499
Okay. What you need to know
about Alex is that he loved life.

00:05.572 --> 00:09.440
<i>He loved it. He played the bass, he traveled,
he'd just gotten back from his trip to Sweden...</i>

00:09.509 --> 00:13.104
<i>only a couple months ago, and he had
his whole life ahead of him.</i>

00:13.179 --> 00:17.616
And then this one stupid accident
just came and took it all away.

00:18.618 --> 00:20.143
<i>Forever.</i>

00:20.220 --> 00:25.886
Liz, she's on this crusade to prove
that Alex's death wasn't accidental.

00:25.959 --> 00:29.122
<i>She's convinced that what happened
to Alex was alien related.</i>

00:29.195 --> 00:31.892
You don't want to think that Alex was killed
by an alien because that would mean...

00:31.965 --> 00:33.899
you are responsible.

00:33.967 --> 00:38.700
- <i>Let's go.</i> - <i>The podsquad was
not too happy about that one.</i>

00:40.140 --> 00:42.404
I guess it's us versus them.

00:42.475 --> 00:45.638
I know what I know, and
I am gonna find out the truth.

00:45.712 --> 00:49.842
And believe me, she will.

00:57.190 --> 01:01.024
It's a two-page yearbook spread.
A collage that... captures...

01:01.094 --> 01:03.028
you know, everything Alex was.

01:03.096 --> 01:07.499
<i>You guys are just great friends
to Alex, you know, still.</i>

01:07.567 --> 01:10.502
Oh, and Liz, tell your folks thanks
for the food they sent over.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.766
Yeah. I'm sure.

01:12.839 --> 01:17.242
- What are these? - Uh, condolence
cards from the floral arrangements.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.301
You can take a look
at them if you'd like.

01:20.547 --> 01:23.710
- “The Olsens“?
- Alex's host family in Sweden.

01:23.783 --> 01:27.048
It's awful to admit, but Gloria and I
didn't even think about contacting them.

01:27.120 --> 01:30.579
- Well, then who did?
- I'm assuming someone from the school.

01:30.657 --> 01:33.422
Alex's entire trip was set up
through the guidance office.

01:34.828 --> 01:37.126
Well. Looks like you guys
are gonna be here for a while.

01:37.197 --> 01:39.791
- <i>I'll</i> order a pizza.
- Oh, no. You really don't have to.

01:39.866 --> 01:41.925
L-lt's nothing.

01:46.372 --> 01:49.637
- Liz, you're being rude.
- Alex put every single thing...

01:49.709 --> 01:52.076
about his entire life
in this computer.

01:52.145 --> 01:54.807
There has got to be something in here to
help us figure out what really happened.

01:54.881 --> 01:58.044
Mr. Whitman let us go through stuff
for the yearbook spread.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.315
You can't look through stuff
for clues. It's immoral.

02:01.387 --> 02:03.913
What's immoral is that
someone murdered Alex.

02:03.990 --> 02:07.085
<i>Look, we have got two clues here.
The numbers on the Thai food receipt...</i>

02:07.160 --> 02:09.094
and his girlfriend Leanna.

02:09.162 --> 02:11.096
Will you start looking through his desk
drawer? See if you can find anything.

02:11.164 --> 02:14.930
- I don't think so. No. - Why, Maria?
Come on. We've only got a few hours here.

02:15.001 --> 02:17.231
Does Max know that you're doing this?

02:17.303 --> 02:20.170
I'm just looking for the truth.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.971
I don't think that Max is interested
in that right now.

02:23.042 --> 02:25.101
God, I hate this.

02:25.178 --> 02:29.012
It's like this chasm has formed
between everybody since-

02:29.082 --> 02:34.680
<i>Since I said aliens were
responsible forA/exs death.</i>

02:34.754 --> 02:37.280
Yes. Look, I really don't think
we should do this...

02:37.357 --> 02:39.451
<i>without them knowing;
it's just gonna make things worse.</i>

02:39.526 --> 02:42.359
As it is, Michael and I haven't
even talked to each other in days.

02:42.428 --> 02:45.921
- Why would he lock this document?
- What?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.331
Inside this folder,
there's five subfolders.

02:48.401 --> 02:52.304
In the last subfolder, there's one locked
file. None of the other files are locked.

02:52.372 --> 02:54.306
It's like he was hiding it.

02:54.374 --> 02:59.813
Do you have any idea what his
security code is? Oh, Maria-

02:59.879 --> 03:02.974
- Look, I really don't think-
-just tell me.

03:04.617 --> 03:06.881
Try “I The Stud.“

03:06.953 --> 03:09.923
He's let me log onto
his e-mail account a few times.

04:16.221 --> 04:19.589
So you're saying this has nothing
to do with A. P. Computer?

04:19.659 --> 04:21.593
Nothing we've been working on lately.

04:21.661 --> 04:24.028
This is binary code. The ones and zeroes...

04:24.097 --> 04:26.589
are usually used to tell a computer
how to operate.

04:26.666 --> 04:28.760
I need you to be more specific.

04:28.835 --> 04:31.497
What does
this particular sequence mean?

04:31.571 --> 04:34.734
Without an application,
it means nothing.

04:36.976 --> 04:39.001
So, are we, uh, still on for study?

04:39.078 --> 04:41.877
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, at your house?
- Yeah.</i>

04:41.948 --> 04:44.610
<i>I'll see you there.</i>

04:45.685 --> 04:47.619
I'll talk to you about this later.

04:52.525 --> 04:57.190
- What's up?
- Liz, I just want to talk this through.

04:57.263 --> 04:59.459
I don't want this to
turn into a war between us.

04:59.532 --> 05:01.796
Between everyone.

05:01.868 --> 05:04.462
Yeah, neither do I.

05:04.537 --> 05:09.373
Look, the other day at the wake,
you were upset about Alex.

05:09.442 --> 05:13.640
I understand how you might have said
some of the things you said.

05:13.713 --> 05:17.775
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm willing to forget about it.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.909
- Wipe the slate clean.
- <i>Max.</i>

05:19.986 --> 05:24.685
Maybe it wasn't right for me
to say what I said just then...

05:24.757 --> 05:27.988
and maybe I could have
said it a little bit calmer...

05:29.095 --> 05:31.655
but I don't regret it- it's true.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.259
Liz, the way you're going
about doing this isn't safe.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.601
Talking to people at school?
Asking questions?

05:41.207 --> 05:44.404
Whenever we decided to do something,
we always decided as a group.

05:45.545 --> 05:49.504
<i>Do you believe</i> me...
about Alex?

05:55.221 --> 05:58.054
No.

05:58.124 --> 06:00.525
Well then we can't act
as a group right now, Max.

06:04.997 --> 06:08.023
Look, whatever happened to Alex
happened while he was in Sweden.

06:08.101 --> 06:11.264
You know that “Leanna is not Leanna“
document? It was created onjanuary16.

06:11.337 --> 06:13.271
- While Alex was still there!
- Will you hold this like this?

06:13.339 --> 06:15.637
Yes. Leanna is not Leanna.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.642
Will you think about it in alien terms?

06:17.710 --> 06:20.008
It could mean that she's
a shape-shifter, or a Skin...

06:20.079 --> 06:22.514
or some other type of alien
that we don't even know about yet.

06:22.582 --> 06:25.552
<i>You know what, think about it
in human terms, okay?</i>

06:25.618 --> 06:27.552
What if he and Leanna
got into a fight, or what if...

06:27.620 --> 06:30.817
he caught Leanna flirting
with another boy or something?

06:30.890 --> 06:33.518
I started playing around with
the sequence of ones and zeroes...

06:33.593 --> 06:36.153
<i>that Alex wrote on the delivery food
receipt the night he was murdered.</i>

06:36.229 --> 06:38.823
Please. Do not use
that word, Liz. Please.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.125
There are 2O altogether.

06:43.202 --> 06:46.797
Then I counted the number of letters
in the phrase, “Leanna is not Leanna.“

06:46.873 --> 06:51.208
Seventeen. Not a match- until I counted
the number of spaces between the words.

06:51.277 --> 06:54.212
Seventeen letters plus
three spaces equals 20.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.874
What if there's a connection?

06:56.949 --> 06:59.111
Hey, can I talk to Maria
for a minute?

07:00.186 --> 07:03.156
- Sure.
- Give me that.

07:04.791 --> 07:06.725
[Sighs] So what's Liz
accusing us of now?

07:06.793 --> 07:09.922
You know what? If you're here to trash talk,
I'm gonna have to take a rain check.

07:09.996 --> 07:13.523
Because that is the only way I'm gonna get
through a simple school day without losing it.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.931
- All right? - Well, you gotta tell
her to get off this Alex thing.

07:17.537 --> 07:20.097
What if she's right though?
You know, what if-

07:20.173 --> 07:22.107
All the more reason
for her not to get involved.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.542
It's dangerous. It's not
for Liz to look into- or you.

07:24.610 --> 07:29.980
[Sighing] God, I hate this. I just hate
that there's this division between all of us.

07:30.049 --> 07:32.518
Well, then maybe Liz shouldn't
have blamed us for killing Alex.

07:32.585 --> 07:35.179
That is not
what she said, Michael.

07:39.592 --> 07:42.425
<i>[ Michael]
What are you doin'?</i>

07:42.495 --> 07:45.465
It's a yearbook collage me and Liz
are doing in memory of Alex.

07:45.531 --> 07:49.559
- And this would be the-
- It's a picture of all his instruments.

<i>Kind or'. Need help?</i>

07:57.910 --> 08:00.106
- Why? Are you serious?
- Yeah.

08:01.714 --> 08:03.705
Well, I, um-

08:03.783 --> 08:07.583
<i>[ Inhales ] I could use a ride to
the photo shop to get some color copies.</i>

08:07.653 --> 08:12.215
- Okay. - Then I gotta track down
this non-clump spray adhesive...

08:12.291 --> 08:15.022
and- [ Sighs]
My X-Acto knife is missing.

08:15.094 --> 08:18.155
And I haven't collected half of the stuff
that we want to put in the collage...

08:18.231 --> 08:22.759
and on top of everything,
I have a major deadline to meet.

08:24.437 --> 08:29.568
[Max] She's obsessed. She keeps
talking to people, asking questions.

08:29.642 --> 08:32.804
Has anybody thought about
the possibility that Liz is right?

08:35.147 --> 08:38.845
I'm the last person who wants to
even remotely consider it, but it's us.

08:38.918 --> 08:41.943
- Stranger things have happened.
- No. She isn't right.

08:42.020 --> 08:44.011
- Max, ifwejust thought about
it for a minute- - Isabel, no.

08:45.324 --> 08:47.816
Liz is wrong.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.864
And even if there were anything remotely
alien about this, our cover is the best defense.

08:50.930 --> 08:54.025
Like it always has been.

08:56.636 --> 08:59.628
Not quite.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.867
I got a letter from San Francisco.
They wait-listed me.

09:03.843 --> 09:06.210
- <i>Really?</i>
- <i>Yeah. It'; good news, you know?</i>

09:06.279 --> 09:08.213
Mrs. Fleischauer's got everybody working
in the guidance counselor's office...

09:08.281 --> 09:11.216
to get me recommendations,
and my teachers are helping-

09:11.284 --> 09:13.548
I mean, this could really
be a good chance for me.

09:17.189 --> 09:19.988
Some people would say,
“Congratulations?

09:22.628 --> 09:25.620
- We'll talk about this later.
- Sure.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.345
<i>I can understand putting
the subject on hold.</i>

09:49.422 --> 09:51.550
I couldn't deal with it either.

09:51.624 --> 09:56.562
But now, ljust- I can't help
wondering where we are.

to understand it more and more.

I mean, did you use like,

You know, to open the lock. I thought
that you stuck a knife in andjiggled.

11:50.276 --> 11:54.509

that I made from a bicycle spoke.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.981
