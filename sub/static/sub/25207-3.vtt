WEBVTT

00:00.032 --> 00:01.835
<i>Previously on "The Bold Type"...</i>

00:01.870 --> 00:03.905
You could add the fact
that you're black.

00:04.021 --> 00:05.377
It's what's on the inside that matters.

00:05.412 --> 00:07.303
Why are labels a bad thing?

00:07.403 --> 00:11.305
I am "Scarlet" magazine's first
black female department head.

00:11.340 --> 00:13.582
I like her.
That's why Oliver gave her the job.

00:13.610 --> 00:15.874
This slut-shaming thing you're doing;
It's gotta stop.

00:15.909 --> 00:17.277
I wasn't.
You were.

00:18.347 --> 00:19.374
I screwed up.

00:19.449 --> 00:21.381
I've already booked
an interview on NY14.

00:21.417 --> 00:24.151
So "Incite" was factually inaccurate.

00:24.186 --> 00:25.986
When we sensationalize people,

00:26.021 --> 00:27.254
that story gets lost.

00:27.289 --> 00:29.027
<i>I made a mistake when I thought
you would be a good fit.</i>

00:29.059 --> 00:31.358
I was trying to make a point.
Jane, you're fired.

00:35.197 --> 00:37.064
<i>Aw, you brought me
breakfast to cheer me up...</i>

00:37.099 --> 00:38.065
<i>and tequila.</i>

00:39.134 --> 00:41.068
Well, you guys
are so sweet for doing this.

00:41.103 --> 00:44.238
Thank you, but seriously... I'm fine.

00:44.273 --> 00:45.405
I mean...

00:45.441 --> 00:47.407
I got fired. Big deal.

00:47.443 --> 00:49.343
You're nobody until you get fired.

00:49.378 --> 00:52.112
I mean, uh, Steve Jobs got fired.

00:52.147 --> 00:54.348
Oprah got fired.
Hmm?

00:54.383 --> 00:57.217
And besides,
I went out in a blaze of glory.

00:57.253 --> 00:59.019
Becoming a meme

00:59.054 --> 01:01.321
is basically like a
millennial rite of passage.

01:03.158 --> 01:05.092
Do you think Jacqueline saw?

01:05.126 --> 01:06.994
Babe, everybody saw.

01:07.029 --> 01:08.228
Great.

01:08.264 --> 01:11.131
Well, anyways,
"Scarlet's" in the rearview.

01:11.166 --> 01:12.399
Onwards and upwards.

01:13.327 --> 01:14.523
Look.

01:14.558 --> 01:15.532
It's my plan for the day.

01:15.567 --> 01:16.970
She made a list.
Of course she did.

01:17.006 --> 01:19.339
Yes, I made a list because I'm a writer.

01:19.375 --> 01:22.042
We'll let you get to it.
So no tequila?

01:22.077 --> 01:24.278
Uh, no. No tequila.

01:24.313 --> 01:26.313
All right.

01:26.348 --> 01:28.315
Have a great day.
You too.

01:28.350 --> 01:30.284
See ya.
Bye.

01:37.293 --> 01:39.026
Wait.

01:39.061 --> 01:41.944
I was just thinking
there is Maya Angelou.

01:41.979 --> 01:44.264
She used to have a glass
of sherry before she wrote,

01:44.300 --> 01:47.100
and I always thought
it was kind of cool.

01:47.136 --> 01:48.402
So...

01:50.372 --> 01:52.139
Go, Tiny Jane.

01:52.174 --> 01:53.340
Oh, you're having it too.

01:53.375 --> 01:55.208
No.
We have to go to work today.

01:55.244 --> 01:57.210
You can have all three.
I'm working today too.

01:57.246 --> 01:59.212
Are you, though?

01:59.248 --> 02:02.015
Yep.
Solidarity.

02:02.051 --> 02:03.283
Thank you.

02:03.319 --> 02:06.153
To Tiny Jane.
To Tiny Jane!

02:09.024 --> 02:10.056
Ugh!

02:12.744 --> 02:16.646
Hi, this is Jane Sloan
calling for Hillary Lin.

02:16.682 --> 02:19.416
No, I was not aware
that she left the magazine.

02:19.451 --> 02:21.718
Anyways,
I worked for the editorial staff

02:21.753 --> 02:23.553
at "Incite," and...

02:25.524 --> 02:28.625
Yes. Yes, that was me on TV.

02:28.660 --> 02:30.560
Well, I was formerly at "Incite."

02:30.595 --> 02:32.462
Parted because of creative differences.

02:32.497 --> 02:34.698
I guess fired is another
way of saying that.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:43.842 --> 02:45.642
For all of the making out
I'm gonna be doing later

02:45.677 --> 02:46.710
with the men of "Scarlet."

02:46.745 --> 02:48.545
How long will this continue?

02:48.580 --> 02:50.747
Hard to say, Mitz. It's real fun.

02:50.782 --> 02:52.649
Red. Follow.

02:52.684 --> 02:55.418
My accessories shoot needs
a photographer, someone new.

02:55.454 --> 02:56.753
You use them three times, and they think

02:56.788 --> 02:58.755
that they're creative partners,
not hired guns.

02:58.790 --> 02:59.683
Style?

02:59.692 --> 03:01.491
Just get someone who can shoot product

03:01.526 --> 03:03.626
and who can make it pop.

03:03.662 --> 03:05.562
I already have an idea. A photographer.

03:05.597 --> 03:06.663
I've been tracking him on Instagram.

03:06.698 --> 03:08.431
He's gotten real hot real fast.

03:08.467 --> 03:09.532
Then why are you still standing here?

03:09.568 --> 03:10.707
No good reason.

03:10.803 --> 03:13.336
I think plus-sized model
Tess Holliday will agree to do

03:13.371 --> 03:15.705
a top ten fashion trends
story for our Snapchat,

03:15.741 --> 03:17.540
<i>and I'm totally geeking out.</i>

03:18.814 --> 03:21.377
I love hearing you get
excited about your work.

03:21.413 --> 03:22.779
What about you? How was your morning?

03:22.814 --> 03:24.414
Didn't you have that meeting?

03:24.449 --> 03:25.582
Mm-hmm. I did.

03:25.617 --> 03:27.450
I met with a few galleries.

03:27.486 --> 03:29.686
<i>No one has availability
right now, but...</i>

03:29.721 --> 03:31.387
<i>at least I have time to get organized,</i>

03:31.423 --> 03:32.756
get inspired.

03:32.791 --> 03:35.391
Time's kinda something
you don't really have, though,

03:35.427 --> 03:36.659
<i>with your visa and all.</i>

03:36.695 --> 03:38.728
<i>Yes, but until I find a gallery,</i>

03:38.764 --> 03:41.564
I just have to focus
on creating the work.

03:41.600 --> 03:42.665
<i>Well, have fun.</i>

03:42.701 --> 03:44.400
<i>Thank you.</i>

03:51.777 --> 03:54.444
Hey, Alex.
Hey.

03:55.244 --> 03:56.613
Is that Le Labo?

03:56.648 --> 03:58.448
Yes. Body wash.

03:58.483 --> 03:59.549
Wow.

04:01.553 --> 04:03.353
Did you have a question?
Yes, I do.

04:03.388 --> 04:05.321
Do you still have the
hookup with the Yankees?

04:05.357 --> 04:06.556
I'm trying to book this photographer.

04:06.591 --> 04:08.725
He's from the Bronx. Pelham123.

04:08.760 --> 04:11.761
And according to his Instagram,
he loves the Yankees, so...

04:11.797 --> 04:14.397
figured I'd sweeten
the deal with some tix.

04:14.432 --> 04:15.632
Straight to the bribery.

04:15.667 --> 04:17.600
It's called greasing the skids, kid.

04:17.636 --> 04:20.570
Someday I'll show you
how the world really works.

04:20.605 --> 04:23.773
Can you get these to Oliver?

04:23.809 --> 04:25.775
Yeah.

04:25.811 --> 04:27.777
Cleo. Hi.

04:27.813 --> 04:30.446
Jacqueline. Hello.

04:30.482 --> 04:32.749
Terrific-looking issue
you've got in the works.

04:32.784 --> 04:34.033
You know, in the board's mind,

04:34.053 --> 04:36.586
this whole theme of body
positivity is evergreen.

04:36.621 --> 04:39.455
Good.
There's just one thing.

04:39.491 --> 04:42.792
This piece on being fit and fat...

04:42.828 --> 04:46.429
the science on that
isn't really there yet.

04:46.464 --> 04:48.531
Well, it's not really
a scientific article.

04:48.567 --> 04:51.734
We're just normalizing the notion
that there's no one ideal body type,

04:51.770 --> 04:54.370
which I think is a very
important message to convey.

04:54.406 --> 04:56.606
But we still need to promote health.

04:58.510 --> 05:00.677
Body positivity is about self-love,

05:00.712 --> 05:03.279
self-acceptance, which is very healthy.

05:03.315 --> 05:05.615
Listen, you can fight this
if you want, but...

05:05.650 --> 05:07.450
you're really swimming upstream.

05:07.485 --> 05:08.518
You should pull it.

05:08.553 --> 05:10.286
The men on the board agree.

05:10.322 --> 05:11.487
I just wanted to give
you a little heads-up.

05:11.523 --> 05:12.622
Well, thank you for that, Cleo.

05:12.657 --> 05:13.806
Of course.

05:13.826 --> 05:15.491
We really need to look
out for each other.

05:15.527 --> 05:16.559
We do.
Mm.

05:17.796 --> 05:19.462
So I'm just gonna head
back upstairs, then.

05:19.497 --> 05:21.431
Good.
Hmm. Bye.

05:21.466 --> 05:22.765
Bye-bye.

05:26.638 --> 05:29.505
I left... Why'd I leave?

05:29.541 --> 05:31.641
That is a great question.

05:31.676 --> 05:33.743
Mm-hmm. Yes, I am that girl.

05:33.778 --> 05:36.312
Where was I previously?
"Scarlet" magazine.

05:36.348 --> 05:37.614
"Scarlet" magazine.
No, thank you for your time.

05:37.649 --> 05:39.782
Great question.

05:39.818 --> 05:41.484
This place is disgusting.

05:47.359 --> 05:48.691
Oh, my goodness.
Wow.

05:48.727 --> 05:51.561
It is so fresh and so clean.
Do you see this?

05:51.596 --> 05:53.529
Wow, wow, wow.
Damn.

05:53.565 --> 05:54.731
Oh, now this makes sense.

05:54.766 --> 05:56.466
Step away from the cleaning supplies.

05:56.501 --> 05:59.335
You gotta stop.
It's therapeutic,

05:59.371 --> 06:01.638
and I honestly don't know
what to do with myself right now.

06:03.642 --> 06:05.475
The fridge is nice and clean.

06:05.510 --> 06:06.643
That was my 3:00.

06:06.678 --> 06:09.646
Please tell me color coordinating
the bookshelf was not your happy hour.

06:09.681 --> 06:12.448
Look, it has been a rough day.

06:12.484 --> 06:15.485
I brought you some "Scarlet" swag.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.620
What is this? Ooh.

06:17.656 --> 06:20.556
A nervous breakdown kit. Cute.

06:20.592 --> 06:24.694
Yeah, guys, it turns out that Tiny Jane
is not so great at being unemployed.

06:24.729 --> 06:26.462
It's been one day.
Have you met me?

06:26.498 --> 06:27.730
You know what else?

06:27.766 --> 06:31.401
All of the answers to your
problems are in that bag.

06:31.436 --> 06:33.636
Come back to "Scarlet."
Nonstarter.

06:33.672 --> 06:35.672
Why?
Because I told Jacqueline

06:35.707 --> 06:37.473
that I need to broaden my horizons.

06:37.509 --> 06:39.642
I'm not gonna go crawling back.

06:43.481 --> 06:45.682
Hello.

06:45.717 --> 06:48.651
Yes, this is Jane Sloan.

06:48.687 --> 06:49.802
It's a job.

06:51.273 --> 06:52.388
Yes, thank you.

06:52.424 --> 06:53.656
That was impressive.

06:53.692 --> 06:54.928
She's calling every friend she knows.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.592
She'll have a job in, like, two weeks.

06:56.628 --> 06:57.705
Yeah, probably.

06:57.829 --> 06:59.495
The house has never been
this clean, though.

06:59.531 --> 07:01.331
I'm really gonna miss it.

07:01.366 --> 07:03.433
Ah, yes. Alex got the Yankees tickets.

07:03.468 --> 07:04.701
What now?

07:04.736 --> 07:06.502
I'm trying to get this
really cool photographer

07:06.538 --> 07:08.404
for an accessories shoot that I'm doing.

07:08.440 --> 07:09.672
Oh.
I really wanna introduce Oliver

07:09.708 --> 07:13.276
to somebody new and cool, you know?

07:13.311 --> 07:15.578
Yeah, hey, um...

07:15.613 --> 07:19.349
crazy idea... uh, what about Adena?

07:20.785 --> 07:22.452
For the photographer?
Yeah.

07:22.487 --> 07:24.420
I mean, you've seen her work, right?

07:24.456 --> 07:26.723
Yeah, she's... amazing.

07:26.758 --> 07:29.625
But she does, like,
gallery stuff, right?

07:29.661 --> 07:32.328
Not really editorial.

07:32.364 --> 07:35.431
Yeah... I'm sure she could, though.

07:35.467 --> 07:36.666
Okay. Um...

07:36.701 --> 07:38.601
does she have a portfolio
and a résumé?

07:38.636 --> 07:40.436
Mm-hmm. I can get it to you.

07:40.472 --> 07:41.504
Great.

07:41.539 --> 07:42.672
Awesome.
Cool.

07:42.707 --> 07:44.440
You guys...

07:44.476 --> 07:45.708
I have a job interview.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.745
Cheers.

07:48.780 --> 07:52.615
Yeah, apparently this editor at
"Next Century" got my résumé

07:52.650 --> 07:55.279
and he wants to meet with me tomorrow.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.754
Cool.
Thank you so much for all this food.

07:57.789 --> 07:59.722
It was so sweet. Um...

07:59.758 --> 08:02.658
but I'm going to need to
excuse myself from this hang.

08:02.694 --> 08:05.561
What...
I have to prep.

08:05.597 --> 08:07.263
It's, like, 7:00.

08:10.468 --> 08:12.502
I think there's dish soap in this glass.

08:13.913 --> 08:15.638
I'm a big fan of "Next Century."

08:15.673 --> 08:17.707
I thought your piece on
charter versus public schools

08:17.742 --> 08:19.609
was fascinating.
Great.

08:19.644 --> 08:22.378
And I don't even have kids.

08:22.414 --> 08:23.679
Even more impressive.

08:25.316 --> 08:27.650
Great résumé. Great samples.

08:27.685 --> 08:28.651
Thank you.

08:30.488 --> 08:32.355
You look so familiar.

08:32.390 --> 08:35.457
What do I know you from?

08:35.493 --> 08:37.293
Petite white girl. Brown hair.

08:37.328 --> 08:38.693
There are a lot of us.

08:38.730 --> 08:41.530
Jane Sloan from "Incite,"

08:41.566 --> 08:43.399
of "Sorry, Not Sorry" fame.

08:43.434 --> 08:45.535
Oh... mild fame.

08:45.570 --> 08:47.370
You kinda threw "Incite" under the bus.

08:47.405 --> 08:50.473
Well, I think that they lost sight
of what was really important.

08:53.445 --> 08:54.644
Well, thanks for coming in...

08:54.679 --> 08:58.347
but I don't see this
as a staff position fit.

08:58.383 --> 09:01.317
But it was nice to meet you, Jane...
What about freelance stuff?

09:01.352 --> 09:02.618
Uh, stringer.

09:02.654 --> 09:05.321
We tend to use those for
more specific assignments.

09:05.356 --> 09:06.522
Okay, like?

09:06.558 --> 09:09.725
Well, we're working on an issue
on the next century of health care.

09:09.761 --> 09:11.561
So who are the innovators?

09:11.596 --> 09:13.463
What are the ripple effects
of a health-care industry

09:13.498 --> 09:14.697
under attack? That sort of thing.

09:14.732 --> 09:17.300
Okay. Okay, I could work with that.

09:17.335 --> 09:18.401
Um...

09:21.339 --> 09:22.538
Jane.

09:22.574 --> 09:24.640
I have another interview.

09:24.676 --> 09:27.376
Right. Right, okay, um...

09:27.412 --> 09:31.614
but I have an idea, and so I will be
getting back to you with a pitch.

09:31.649 --> 09:33.316
Okay.
Okay.

09:33.351 --> 09:35.451
Okay. Perfect.

09:35.487 --> 09:37.620
Um, thank you so much.

09:45.408 --> 09:47.708
Yankees tickets, as requested.

09:47.744 --> 09:49.710
Ugh, I owe you my firstborn.

09:49.746 --> 09:51.579
It's gonna be a while.

09:51.614 --> 09:53.514
Actually, you owe me $185.
Copy that.

09:53.549 --> 09:55.449
And no Bitcoin this time.
Ripple?

09:55.485 --> 09:57.418
Cash.
Mm, we'll see.

09:57.453 --> 09:58.586
Hope you get that photographer.

09:58.621 --> 09:59.687
Me too.
What's up, Alex?

09:59.722 --> 10:02.490
Hey.
Bad news, Red.

10:02.525 --> 10:03.724
My country chic shoot in the Berkshires

10:03.760 --> 10:05.726
has gone sideways.
The designer dropped out

10:05.762 --> 10:08.496
once he realized this was
for our body positivity issue.

10:08.531 --> 10:10.665
He doesn't want his brand
associated with anything

10:10.700 --> 10:12.466
but a size zero.

10:12.502 --> 10:14.735
That is horrific.
Preach.

10:14.771 --> 10:17.438
Anyway, now I have
to drive up to the boondocks

10:17.473 --> 10:20.341
and banish his negative
juju from my set.

10:20.376 --> 10:22.576
If there are mosquitoes, they love me.

10:22.612 --> 10:24.137
Apparently I'm delicious.

10:24.172 --> 10:27.515
All of this means you're in charge
of tomorrow's accessories shoot.

10:27.550 --> 10:29.450
Was anything I said confusing?

10:29.485 --> 10:31.452
No, uh... it's just my processing face.

10:31.487 --> 10:33.354
They're accessories.

10:33.389 --> 10:34.722
They don't demand
grapefruit sparkling water

10:34.757 --> 10:36.691
at exactly 61.3 degrees,

10:36.726 --> 10:39.694
and they don't accidentally walk off
with a pair of Louboutins.

10:39.729 --> 10:42.463
They're the size of your fists
and they stay where you put them.

10:43.833 --> 10:44.819
Just follow the lookbook,

10:44.820 --> 10:46.180
and make sure the candy pops.
Okay.

10:46.215 --> 10:48.983
As long as the photographer
has film in the camera, you'll be fine.

10:49.072 --> 10:50.538
But don't let me down.

10:54.711 --> 10:57.378
Well, you should be all set.
This is so dope. Thank you, Kat.

10:57.413 --> 10:58.379
Yeah.
Tess.

10:58.414 --> 10:59.413
I'm Sutton Brady.

10:59.449 --> 11:00.614
I just had to come meet you.

11:00.650 --> 11:02.450
I work in the fashion department.

11:02.485 --> 11:04.485
Your swimsuit line is incredible.

11:04.520 --> 11:05.686
Thanks, girl.

11:05.722 --> 11:08.456
Uh, Tess is taking over our Snapchat
for a day of shopping.

11:08.491 --> 11:10.424
Yeah. It's gonna be really tough

11:10.460 --> 11:12.326
shopping in New York
on "Scarlet's" credit card,

11:12.362 --> 11:14.396
but I'm mentally preparing.

11:14.731 --> 11:17.365
Like, honestly,
we are so excited to have you

11:17.400 --> 11:18.699
and your body positivity message.

11:18.735 --> 11:21.302
Well, I love "Scarlet" a whole bunch,

11:21.337 --> 11:22.470
but I have to run.
Yeah.

11:22.505 --> 11:23.637
It was so good to see you, Kat.

11:23.673 --> 11:24.772
It was nice to meet you, Sutton.

11:24.807 --> 11:25.674
You too.
All right.

11:25.756 --> 11:27.475
I'll see you later, okay?
Bye.

11:27.510 --> 11:28.576
All right, bye.

11:28.611 --> 11:29.918
Ah!

11:30.813 --> 11:33.347
She's amazing.
Okay, I gotta go.

11:33.383 --> 11:35.649
Oh, hey, wait. I have something for you.

11:35.685 --> 11:37.585
Adena's material.

11:37.620 --> 11:39.320
Oh, I'm kind of in the middle
of something with Oliver.

11:39.355 --> 11:42.390
No, no, come on.
It'll take, like, two seconds.

11:42.425 --> 11:43.624
Okay.

11:44.560 --> 11:47.495
Okay. Uh, this is her tearbook,

11:47.530 --> 11:50.664
and here is a flash drive
with her most recent work.

11:50.700 --> 11:53.367
Cool. Thanks.

11:53.403 --> 11:54.769
Well, you should take a look.

11:54.804 --> 11:56.437
Okay.

12:00.410 --> 12:01.409
Mm.

12:01.444 --> 12:02.676
Oh, wow.
Yeah.

12:02.712 --> 12:04.512
Very artistic.

12:04.547 --> 12:06.414
Did you know she studied at Speos?

12:06.449 --> 12:07.715
I don't even know what Speos is.

12:07.750 --> 12:11.318
It's a photography institute in Paris.

12:11.354 --> 12:13.354
Oh... Paris.

12:13.389 --> 12:14.622
Very impressive.

12:14.657 --> 12:16.323
Yeah.

12:16.359 --> 12:17.625
So what do you think?

12:17.660 --> 12:19.360
I think that she's an option,

12:19.395 --> 12:21.395
but I'm looking at other people too.

12:21.431 --> 12:23.497
Okay, well,
you know you can trust me, right?

12:23.533 --> 12:25.399
I'd never put you in a bad position.

12:25.435 --> 12:26.634
I know.

12:28.504 --> 12:30.304
What?

12:30.339 --> 12:32.573
Well, I mean...

12:32.608 --> 12:34.742
have you considered what I want?

12:34.777 --> 12:37.711
A good photographer?

12:37.747 --> 12:39.747
We don't even know if Adena can do this.

12:39.782 --> 12:42.716
I mean, product photography
isn't what she does.

12:42.752 --> 12:45.519
Yeah, but she's a professional, so...

12:45.555 --> 12:47.621
She's also a little off-brand
for "Scarlet."

12:47.657 --> 12:48.682
Um...

12:49.358 --> 12:52.460
It wasn't that long ago that she was
actually featured in the magazine.

12:52.495 --> 12:54.662
And besides which,
maybe she can spice it up, you know?

12:54.697 --> 12:56.464
Yeah, I don't need
somebody to spice it up.

12:56.499 --> 12:58.532
I just need someone
who can get it right.

12:58.568 --> 13:01.669
Oliver put me in charge,
and I can't mess this up.

13:01.704 --> 13:03.737
Uh, you think...

13:03.773 --> 13:05.673
Adena's gonna mess it up?

13:05.708 --> 13:07.641
Look...
She needs this job, okay?

13:07.677 --> 13:09.310
I mean, if she doesn't

13:09.345 --> 13:11.579
show her photography
and get good press...

13:13.783 --> 13:15.749
This is about Adena's visa?

13:19.522 --> 13:22.690
Yeah. Partly, yes.

13:24.327 --> 13:26.460
That's a lot.
I know.

13:29.765 --> 13:33.334
Look, I get it. You wanna help her.

13:33.369 --> 13:36.337
I wanna help her too.

13:36.372 --> 13:37.605
I just...

13:37.640 --> 13:40.774
don't think that this
is the right shoot.

13:40.810 --> 13:42.776
Why?
Because.

13:42.812 --> 13:44.512
Adena has a great career.

13:44.547 --> 13:46.514
She can find other opportunities.

13:46.549 --> 13:47.715
But Oliver...

13:47.750 --> 13:50.417
putting his trust in me to run something

13:50.453 --> 13:53.387
and me doing a good job,
that could be huge.

13:53.422 --> 13:55.689
A huge step.

13:55.725 --> 13:58.392
I don't see how you don't get that.

14:01.330 --> 14:03.397
Okay.

14:03.432 --> 14:07.334
All right, well,
just let me know what you decide.

14:07.370 --> 14:09.270
Thanks.

14:10.573 --> 14:11.911
Damn it.

14:14.544 --> 14:15.709
Hello.

14:15.745 --> 14:17.678
Wow, you sound worse than me,

14:17.713 --> 14:19.680
and I am super unemployed

14:19.715 --> 14:21.615
and currently in a tangerine eye mask

14:21.651 --> 14:23.384
<i>trying to fend off a panic attack.</i>

14:23.419 --> 14:24.718
What's up?

14:24.754 --> 14:28.656
Do you remember that doctor
from the other night at the bar?

14:28.691 --> 14:30.591
<i>The one that specialized
in low-income patients?</i>

14:30.626 --> 14:33.394
Ben with the biceps and the dimples?

14:33.429 --> 14:35.596
Uh, not the point, but yeah.

14:35.631 --> 14:36.730
<i>Do you think I could interview him?</i>

14:36.766 --> 14:38.632
Yeah. I don't see why not.

14:38.668 --> 14:40.367
Oh. How was your interview?

14:40.403 --> 14:41.368
<i>Ugh.</i>

14:41.404 --> 14:43.304
Not great.

14:43.339 --> 14:45.439
The editor saw me on New York 14

14:45.474 --> 14:47.408
and was not impressed.

14:47.443 --> 14:51.545
But I convinced him to take
a look at a freelance pitch.

14:51.581 --> 14:52.679
Yeah, you did.

14:52.782 --> 14:56.383
Yeah, except now
I need said freelance pitch.

14:56.419 --> 14:57.618
They're doing an issue

14:57.653 --> 14:59.653
on the problems facing
health care today,

14:59.689 --> 15:02.590
so I figured Ben would
have an opinion on that

15:02.625 --> 15:05.292
and maybe I could pick his brain.

15:05.328 --> 15:08.462
I am sending you his number
right... now.

15:08.497 --> 15:09.630
Do you think he'll remember me?

15:09.665 --> 15:11.398
<i>Yeah. Meeting you at the bar</i>

15:11.434 --> 15:13.500
was definitely the
highlight of his week.

15:13.536 --> 15:14.735
<i>I mean...</i>

15:14.770 --> 15:17.471
I'm sure he delivered a couple babies
and witnessed the miracle of life,

15:17.506 --> 15:19.273
but you were a close second.

15:19.308 --> 15:20.608
Oh, hey,
how's the photographer search going?

15:20.643 --> 15:22.376
<i>Not great.</i>

15:22.411 --> 15:25.446
Kat is really pressuring
me to hire Adena.

15:25.481 --> 15:26.714
What do you think I should do?

15:26.749 --> 15:28.616
That's tough.

15:28.651 --> 15:29.543
<i>I don't know...</i>

15:29.586 --> 15:33.621
<i>but I know you'll make the right choice.</i>

15:33.656 --> 15:36.690
I really miss you. I wish you were here.

15:36.726 --> 15:38.559
<i>I know. I miss you too, Munchkin.</i>

15:38.625 --> 15:40.394
Oh.

15:40.429 --> 15:42.563
Dr. Ben just texted me back. I gotta go.

15:42.598 --> 15:43.731
<i>I love you. You got this.</i>

15:43.766 --> 15:45.599
Okay. Bye.

15:51.641 --> 15:52.773
Thank you for seeing me so soon.

15:52.808 --> 15:54.742
Uh-huh. So what's your article about?

15:55.183 --> 15:58.812
I wanna explore the business
of pro bono medicine post-Obamacare.

15:58.847 --> 16:00.481
Oh, sorry, it's my clinic.

16:00.516 --> 16:02.316
Hey, yeah.

16:02.351 --> 16:03.778
Yeah, just make sure Mrs.
Flores gets a free sample

16:03.820 --> 16:05.719
of that Z-pak, and I want
to see her in two weeks.

16:05.755 --> 16:08.255
And get her number before
she leaves and test it.

16:08.291 --> 16:09.590
Cool. Thanks.

16:09.625 --> 16:11.425
Wow.

16:11.460 --> 16:13.394
You run a free clinic,
and you work for a hospital.

16:13.429 --> 16:14.628
Well, I have a lot of patients in need.

16:14.664 --> 16:16.397
There are programs
for low-income people,

16:16.432 --> 16:17.498
but they're a scam.

16:17.533 --> 16:19.433
The paperwork's byzantine.

16:19.468 --> 16:20.634
Byzantine.

16:20.670 --> 16:22.503
It means administratively
overcomplicated.

16:22.538 --> 16:24.271
I know what it means.

16:24.307 --> 16:26.273
They do it on purpose.
I mean, to save money.

16:26.309 --> 16:28.335
Get people who are ESL
to just give up on the filing

16:28.370 --> 16:29.410
'cause it's too difficult.

16:29.445 --> 16:32.446
So I do a lot of the paperwork myself.

16:32.481 --> 16:34.415
Sometimes all of it.

16:34.450 --> 16:38.552
Lucia Marie Villapando.

16:38.587 --> 16:40.287
Can't you get in trouble for that?

16:40.323 --> 16:41.722
Yeah, but it's unlikely.

16:41.757 --> 16:43.724
And Lucia needs a pap smear, so...

16:45.461 --> 16:47.461
Hey, I'm happy to answer more questions,

16:47.496 --> 16:48.629
but you're gonna have to come with me.

16:48.664 --> 16:50.497
Where?
Maternity ward.

16:50.533 --> 16:51.598
Patient's in labor.

16:53.636 --> 16:55.636
Coming?
Oh, yeah.

17:11.938 --> 17:13.790
Hi.
Oh, hey. Sorry.

17:13.795 --> 17:16.662
I was just looking for
some things for Oliver.

17:16.696 --> 17:18.696
Well, I just need
an accessory for this outfit.

17:22.469 --> 17:25.503
Everything okay?
Yeah.

17:25.539 --> 17:28.473
Help you...

17:28.509 --> 17:30.842
Do you... do you ever work with friends?

17:30.878 --> 17:31.910
Yeah.

17:33.747 --> 17:35.547
You thinking of working with a friend?

17:35.583 --> 17:36.882
Sort of. A friend of a friend.

17:36.917 --> 17:38.650
Hiring her.
Mm.

17:38.686 --> 17:40.485
Could she do the job?

17:40.521 --> 17:42.621
I think so. I hope so.

17:42.656 --> 17:43.922
I would be...

17:43.958 --> 17:45.657
taking a chance on her.

17:45.693 --> 17:46.825
Hmm.

17:51.565 --> 17:53.799
Oh. Try this.

17:58.606 --> 18:01.773
Good eye.
Thanks.

18:03.711 --> 18:05.444
Look...

18:05.479 --> 18:07.479
hiring anyone is always
a game of chance.

18:07.514 --> 18:10.649
Have a seat.

18:10.684 --> 18:14.453
The best work comes
when taking the biggest risk.

18:14.488 --> 18:15.787
You know how I got my first writing gig?

18:15.823 --> 18:17.422
I don't.

18:17.458 --> 18:18.724
Adele Ritter.

18:18.759 --> 18:20.559
Former editor in chief of "Scarlet."

18:20.594 --> 18:21.847
When I was in my 20s,

18:21.863 --> 18:24.463
I used to go to this little
coffee shop down on Amsterdam,

18:24.498 --> 18:26.019
where I would write,
and Adele would see me there,

18:26.067 --> 18:28.500
and one day, she just sat down
right in front of me.

18:28.535 --> 18:29.868
She said, "Oh, my God,
every time I see you",

18:29.903 --> 18:31.870
"you're just writing away
like there's no tomorrow.

18:31.905 --> 18:35.841
I must know what the story is
you're so determined to tell."

18:35.876 --> 18:37.709
What were you writing about?

18:37.745 --> 18:38.910
Benazir Bhutto.

18:38.946 --> 18:40.779
First woman to lead an Islamic country.

18:40.814 --> 18:42.447
1988.

18:42.483 --> 18:44.516
I gave a copy to Adele...

18:44.551 --> 18:48.920
and a few days later,
she offered me an internship here.

18:48.956 --> 18:51.523
She took a chance.

18:53.961 --> 18:56.495
I know you're really busy, but...

18:56.530 --> 18:58.897
why don't you write anymore?

19:02.603 --> 19:03.802
You know, I don't know.

19:05.773 --> 19:08.507
Thanks for the bauble.

19:08.542 --> 19:10.442
Thanks for the advice.

19:23.791 --> 19:25.490
Hey.

19:25.526 --> 19:27.426
Hey.
What are you doing?

19:27.461 --> 19:28.860
I am helping young women
love their bodies

19:28.896 --> 19:30.896
without the help of modern corsets.

19:30.931 --> 19:32.497
No, thanks, Spanx.

19:33.634 --> 19:35.867
Cool.
Yeah.

19:35.903 --> 19:37.836
Here is the paperwork.

19:37.871 --> 19:40.739
She'll get the concept
abstract via email, but...

19:40.774 --> 19:42.708
I wanna hire Adena.

19:42.743 --> 19:44.843
What happened to the
photographer you liked?

19:44.878 --> 19:46.678
I told him it wasn't gonna work out.

19:46.714 --> 19:48.814
I let him keep the Yankees tickets
to soften the blow.

19:50.884 --> 19:52.784
Hey, thank you.

19:52.820 --> 19:55.587
I know you're going out
on a limb for Adena.

19:55.622 --> 19:58.457
Adena's a pro. She deserves a shot.

19:58.492 --> 19:59.891
Yeah.

20:00.894 --> 20:01.907
Yeah.

20:07.768 --> 20:09.468
Where's she at?

20:09.503 --> 20:10.736
Water broke at 10:00 a.m.

20:10.771 --> 20:12.471
Contractions are six minutes apart,

20:12.506 --> 20:13.905
but she's only dilated 3 centimeters.

20:13.941 --> 20:16.475
Mrs. Nunes, I'm Dr. Ben Chau.

20:16.510 --> 20:18.610
Ay, no, no, no. Where's Dr. Harrison?

20:18.645 --> 20:20.846
Well, he's not here, so I'm on call.

20:20.881 --> 20:23.515
But we need to get you dilated
so you can meet your baby.

20:23.550 --> 20:24.816
What do you mean he's not here?

20:24.852 --> 20:26.752
Dr. Harrison is at his
daughter's graduation.

20:26.787 --> 20:28.920
But do not worry because,
Dr. Chau is gonna take

20:28.956 --> 20:30.689
such good care of you.

20:30.724 --> 20:33.658
He looks like a baby himself.

20:33.694 --> 20:35.727
I've been practicing for five years,

20:35.763 --> 20:38.864
and I've delivered 1,272 babies...

20:38.899 --> 20:39.931
and yours...

20:39.967 --> 20:42.901
will be 1,273.

20:42.936 --> 20:44.936
So... let's do this.

20:44.972 --> 20:47.739
I am not listening to you.
That's fine...

20:47.775 --> 20:50.575
'cause now it's time to dance.

20:52.980 --> 20:55.547
What the hell?

20:55.582 --> 20:57.916
I could give you pitocin,
but your chart says "natural."

20:57.951 --> 20:59.785
So I'd rather get you
on your feet dancing.

20:59.820 --> 21:01.553
It helps speed up labor.

21:06.660 --> 21:08.894
I am going to sue.
Well, that's fine.

21:08.929 --> 21:11.463
You can have my golf clubs,
which I never use anyway,

21:11.498 --> 21:12.697
but dance first.

21:12.733 --> 21:15.700
Otherwise, you'll have
nothing to sue about.

21:15.736 --> 21:17.836
He keeps a boombox in his backpack?

21:17.871 --> 21:19.771
He swears the sound is
better than bluetooth.

21:19.807 --> 21:22.607
Come on, Jane, Miriam.
You don't get to just watch.

21:23.844 --> 21:25.544
Come on.

21:25.579 --> 21:27.712
<i>♪ When we're in a disco ♪</i>

21:27.748 --> 21:29.815
<i>♪ Doin' our favorite moves ♪</i>

21:29.850 --> 21:31.650
Disco sucks.

21:31.685 --> 21:34.719
There we go. Let's bring that baby out.

21:34.755 --> 21:36.788
You feel it? It's coming?

21:36.824 --> 21:37.823
There we go.

21:54.675 --> 21:55.974
No, she's in a meeting.

21:56.009 --> 21:57.943
No, I can't get her out right now.

21:57.978 --> 21:59.544
She's very busy.

21:59.580 --> 22:00.779
Hold my calls for the next hour.

22:00.814 --> 22:02.781
Oh. Okay.

22:02.816 --> 22:04.482
No, that wasn't her.

22:29.943 --> 22:31.186
Are we doing atmosphere?

22:31.212 --> 22:33.578
No, Oliver wants all these
shots to be pin sharp.

22:33.614 --> 22:34.846
Copy that.

22:34.882 --> 22:36.548
Hey, how's it going?

22:36.583 --> 22:37.749
Good.
Yeah.

22:37.784 --> 22:38.689
I'm excited to be here.
Oh, good.

22:38.753 --> 22:40.685
I was looking at the concept last night.

22:40.721 --> 22:42.520
Mm-hmm.
Using candy as a backdrop

22:42.556 --> 22:44.522
for the jewelry is fun.

22:44.558 --> 22:45.657
Yeah.

22:45.692 --> 22:46.992
I think what we're trying to explore

22:47.027 --> 22:49.661
is that jewelry can be
fancy but also playful,

22:49.696 --> 22:52.664
so all of the candy is over
there for you to play with.

22:52.699 --> 22:55.834
We wanna use contrasting colors
to make all the pieces pop.

22:57.571 --> 22:59.537
Can I make a suggestion?

22:59.573 --> 23:02.540
Sure, um, but I also have to kind of...

23:02.576 --> 23:04.609
stick to what was approved.

23:04.645 --> 23:06.511
I have a few thoughts
that could make it better.

23:06.546 --> 23:08.580
You want this to be great?

23:08.615 --> 23:09.814
Yes. Um...

23:09.850 --> 23:11.883
I also have a really tight timeline.

23:11.919 --> 23:13.718
Let me put together a shot and show you.

23:13.754 --> 23:15.620
This won't take long.
I'll be right back, okay?

23:15.656 --> 23:16.888
Okay.

23:21.895 --> 23:23.628
Hi, boss.

23:23.664 --> 23:24.863
<i>Just checking in. How's it going?</i>

23:24.898 --> 23:26.564
Great. Fantastic.

23:26.600 --> 23:27.449
Really good.

23:27.468 --> 23:29.122
<i>I'll be back in the
office in the morning.</i>

23:29.203 --> 23:30.936
<i>Can't wait to see the proofs.</i>

23:30.971 --> 23:33.505
I can't wait to show you.

23:33.556 --> 23:36.608
<i>You sound optimistic.</i>

23:36.643 --> 23:38.632
Definitely gonna have
some really good stuff.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.327
Thank you for letting me
tag along today.

23:42.423 --> 23:43.588
No worries.

23:43.624 --> 23:44.963
Hey make sure L&D has a room ready,

23:45.026 --> 23:47.592
and let me know when it's time.
Of course.

23:47.628 --> 23:49.628
So I'm guessing it worked.

23:49.663 --> 23:52.230
Yeah, she's headed down
to delivery soon.

23:52.266 --> 23:53.265
It was fun...

23:53.300 --> 23:55.267
dancing, watching you dance.

23:55.302 --> 23:56.435
Uh...

23:56.470 --> 23:57.832
fun and a little painful.

23:58.572 --> 24:01.273
Well, I never said I was any good.

24:01.308 --> 24:03.442
You care a lot.

24:03.477 --> 24:05.410
Just write a good story.

24:05.446 --> 24:06.478
I will.

24:06.513 --> 24:08.380
The struggle for low-income women

24:08.415 --> 24:11.650
to navigate a health-care system
that's designed to leave them out.

24:11.685 --> 24:14.186
Sounds about right.

24:17.257 --> 24:19.191
Um, can I ask you a question?

24:19.760 --> 24:20.592
What, like you haven't been all day?

24:22.496 --> 24:27.332
You went to UCSF and Columbia
Med School on scholarship?

24:27.367 --> 24:29.401
That's on the Internet?

24:29.436 --> 24:31.570
I am a journalist. I can dig.

24:31.605 --> 24:33.238
Apparently.

24:34.475 --> 24:36.341
Yeah, when I was 15,
my parents split up,

24:36.376 --> 24:38.577
and I came to the U.S. with my mom.

24:38.612 --> 24:40.412
She couldn't afford
to send me to college,

24:40.447 --> 24:41.513
let alone med school.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.248
And we weren't rich, so...

24:43.283 --> 24:44.583
had to be smart.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.619
But you could be working somewhere else,

24:47.654 --> 24:50.489
making a lot more money
and working a lot less.

24:50.524 --> 24:53.225
Why would I do that?

24:53.260 --> 24:55.260
Because you could be
making a lot more money

24:55.295 --> 24:56.922
and working a lot less.

24:57.564 --> 25:00.565
Jane, money's nice, and I'm fine,

25:00.601 --> 25:02.334
but...

25:02.369 --> 25:04.503
I love doing what I do.

25:04.538 --> 25:06.571
I mean, I love the people I work with.

25:06.607 --> 25:08.373
I jump out of bed every morning

25:08.408 --> 25:11.476
and I wish there were
more hours in the day.

25:11.512 --> 25:13.411
Like you, I'm guessing.

25:13.447 --> 25:15.347
It's pretty obvious to me
you love doing what you do.

25:21.622 --> 25:24.623
Yeah, I-I do.

25:25.281 --> 25:27.492
Um, that was meant
to be a compliment, sorry.

25:27.528 --> 25:29.294
Oh, no, no, I know.

25:29.329 --> 25:30.495
Um...

25:30.531 --> 25:32.531
I really appreciate it.

25:33.567 --> 25:35.500
They're ready for you, Dr. Chau.

25:37.671 --> 25:39.571
I've gotta go.

25:39.606 --> 25:41.273
Yeah. Of course.

25:41.308 --> 25:43.642
You better, uh, boogie to it.

25:44.316 --> 25:45.610
Bye, Jane.
Bye.

26:12.472 --> 26:13.638
Hi. Hi.

26:13.674 --> 26:16.608
Um, smashed candy
was not part of the plan.

26:16.643 --> 26:19.611
I know, but I think it captures
the sense of playfulness you want

26:19.646 --> 26:22.480
in an unexpected and irreverent way.

26:22.516 --> 26:26.484
Oliver's expecting the... expected.

26:26.520 --> 26:28.220
Just let me finish lighting it.

26:28.255 --> 26:29.321
I think you'll like it.

26:29.356 --> 26:31.256
Just trust me, okay?

26:34.394 --> 26:36.695
Hey. How's it going?

26:36.730 --> 26:38.597
Oh. What?

26:38.632 --> 26:41.433
It's a disaster.
I knew this was gonna happen.

26:41.468 --> 26:44.336
Why, though?
She's going full artiste.

26:44.371 --> 26:46.538
Oh, okay. Um...

26:46.573 --> 26:48.673
Well, maybe that's not such a bad thing.

26:48.709 --> 26:50.709
No, it is a bad thing.

26:50.744 --> 26:53.345
"Scarlet" is not the place
for her edgy protest art.

26:53.380 --> 26:54.479
She doesn't get it.

26:54.514 --> 26:56.314
And she is not listening to me.

26:56.350 --> 26:58.450
No, I'm sure she's just trying
to help, you know?

26:58.485 --> 27:00.352
I don't even think she respects me, Kat.

27:00.387 --> 27:02.320
What are you talking about?
Of course she respects you.

27:02.356 --> 27:05.624
She blew right past my idea
like it was somehow inferior.

27:05.659 --> 27:07.659
Because she hangs her art
in galleries and goes to Paris

27:07.694 --> 27:09.361
and I'm an assistant?

27:09.396 --> 27:11.229
You act like she's so different.

27:11.265 --> 27:12.530
She is so different.

27:14.434 --> 27:16.201
Let's go back to the original plan.

27:16.236 --> 27:19.271
Let's get the unbroken candy
over here, please.

27:19.306 --> 27:20.538
Thank you.

27:24.278 --> 27:26.511
Fortunately for the women
of east New York,

27:26.546 --> 27:28.647
it is Dr. Ben Chau's
profound love for his job

27:28.682 --> 27:30.448
that fuels him.

27:30.484 --> 27:34.552
Everyone in that low-income community
is much better for it.

27:37.557 --> 27:40.525
Even Ben...

27:40.560 --> 27:42.494
who truly loves his job.

27:49.403 --> 27:51.670
Hey, can I take a look?

27:51.705 --> 27:53.471
Yeah, of course.

27:53.507 --> 27:56.441
Uh, I'm still working
on the color balance,

27:56.476 --> 27:57.542
but we're almost there.

28:02.249 --> 28:03.515
Um...

28:03.550 --> 28:06.351
I am sorry about earlier.

28:06.386 --> 28:09.287
I was disrespectful.

28:09.323 --> 28:12.390
This is your shoot,
and I respect you very much.

28:12.426 --> 28:14.192
You did hear that?

28:14.227 --> 28:15.560
Um, yes.
Ugh, Adena...

28:15.595 --> 28:17.228
No.
I'm so sorry.

28:17.264 --> 28:19.197
No, no, no, no. Um...

28:19.232 --> 28:20.432
you were right.

28:20.467 --> 28:23.401
The fact is,
we are very different, but...

28:23.437 --> 28:26.338
I believe we're also alike. Um...

28:26.373 --> 28:27.539
we both have passion.

28:27.574 --> 28:28.640
We're both outsiders,

28:28.675 --> 28:30.575
but we never let that stop us.

28:30.610 --> 28:34.245
We both care deeply for Kat.

28:37.284 --> 28:39.484
You're right... about all of that.

28:41.355 --> 28:43.254
And you're right about this.

28:43.290 --> 28:45.557
This concept, it's...

28:45.592 --> 28:47.592
it's not working.

28:47.627 --> 28:49.661
It's childish, right?

28:51.598 --> 28:53.398
It's not connecting with me either.

28:53.433 --> 28:55.266
Yeah, it's...

28:55.302 --> 28:56.501
Ugh, this was supposed to be easy.

28:56.536 --> 28:59.537
Okay, um...

28:59.573 --> 29:01.172
well, we can fix it.

29:01.208 --> 29:03.441
If Oliver were here, he would improvise.

29:04.308 --> 29:06.378
This is our body positivity issue.

29:09.583 --> 29:13.585
We could use a real woman, not a model.

29:17.424 --> 29:19.424
That's unexpected.
Yeah...

29:19.459 --> 29:21.359
and crazy, so shoot this

29:21.395 --> 29:23.228
in case Oliver tries to kill me.

29:23.263 --> 29:25.563
Um, but do it fast and leave
us some time at the end.

29:28.368 --> 29:29.667
Okay, you got it.

29:29.703 --> 29:31.236
Hey.
Hey, uh,

29:31.271 --> 29:32.604
look, Sutton, I know that I...

29:32.639 --> 29:34.439
I put you in a really
awkward position...

29:34.474 --> 29:35.773
Oh, don't worry about it.

29:35.776 --> 29:37.340
I know you were just trying
to help your girlfriend,

29:37.411 --> 29:40.578
and, honestly, something
really cool came out of it.

29:40.614 --> 29:42.414
Well, that's cool.
Yeah.

29:42.449 --> 29:43.448
What came out of it?

29:44.260 --> 29:45.350
Oh.

29:45.385 --> 29:47.685
Tiny Jane's coming.
Oh, good, we can use her.

29:47.721 --> 29:49.587
We're getting naked.

29:49.623 --> 29:50.588
Okay, cool.

29:55.730 --> 29:58.321
Okay, homies.
Everybody good with the plan?

29:58.356 --> 29:59.522
Mm-hmm.
No makeup.

29:59.557 --> 30:01.424
No airbrush. Just embracing the flaws.

30:01.459 --> 30:03.626
Pimples and moles
and stretch marks, oh, my.

30:03.661 --> 30:05.528
Just happy to be with my girls.

30:05.563 --> 30:07.296
What do you think Oliver's gonna say?

30:07.332 --> 30:10.400
Hopefully that he loves it. Otherwise...

30:10.435 --> 30:11.667
I don't want to think about otherwise.

30:11.703 --> 30:13.436
Hey, no matter what, I'm proud of you.

30:13.471 --> 30:14.637
I'm proud of all of us.

30:14.672 --> 30:17.673
Is everyone ready?

30:17.709 --> 30:19.609
Adena.
What?

30:19.644 --> 30:21.511
I am making my models more comfortable.

30:21.546 --> 30:24.480
And we don't have all day.
Drop those robes, girls.

30:24.516 --> 30:25.748
Everyone ready?

30:25.784 --> 30:29.285
She ready.
Ah, showtime.

31:14.732 --> 31:16.466
I forgot how good your boobs looked.

31:16.501 --> 31:18.501
Thank you!
I didn't forget.

31:20.752 --> 31:22.538
It was so much fun. I loved it.

31:22.574 --> 31:24.540
Yeah. We noticed.

31:24.576 --> 31:26.709
God, I miss this.

31:26.744 --> 31:28.611
The three of us in here.

31:28.646 --> 31:30.546
You know, it feels like old times.

31:30.582 --> 31:33.416
I know.

31:33.451 --> 31:36.652
Ugh, seeing Ben with his
patients and his coworkers,

31:36.688 --> 31:41.691
it, like, made me miss being
part of a squad, you know?

31:41.726 --> 31:44.460
Writing alone is real lonely.

31:44.496 --> 31:46.662
Why do you think Sylvia Plath
put her head in an oven?

31:48.700 --> 31:49.699
Dark.

31:52.804 --> 31:55.304
I mean, like, what we did today,

31:55.340 --> 31:57.306
that's something that I wish
that I saw in magazines

31:57.342 --> 31:58.307
when I was growing up.

31:58.343 --> 31:59.342
That was so great.

31:59.377 --> 32:01.477
And we were together.

32:01.513 --> 32:02.712
That was the best part.

32:03.354 --> 32:04.380
Come back.

32:04.415 --> 32:06.315
This is where you belong, Jane.

32:07.552 --> 32:08.618
I know.

32:08.653 --> 32:10.586
So what are you gonna do?

32:12.657 --> 32:14.357
Go see Jacqueline

32:14.392 --> 32:16.392
and see if I could come back.

32:19.274 --> 32:20.463
I was right!

32:35.613 --> 32:37.713
I didn't hear you come in last night.

32:37.749 --> 32:39.549
Yeah, you know, fashion closet

32:39.584 --> 32:42.418
turned into happy hour turned into...

32:42.453 --> 32:45.321
almost closing the place down.

32:45.356 --> 32:47.490
Jane was pounding liquid courage.

32:47.525 --> 32:48.558
How is Jane?

32:48.593 --> 32:49.759
With any luck, she'll be...

32:49.794 --> 32:52.562
back at "Scarlet" soon.

32:52.597 --> 32:54.430
It was a fun shoot.

32:56.181 --> 32:57.144
Yes, it was.

32:57.179 --> 32:59.435
I was happy to be a part
of your "Scarlet" world,

32:59.470 --> 33:00.536
even if it was brief.

33:00.572 --> 33:02.371
It was brief but...

33:02.407 --> 33:03.639
definitely memorable.
Mm-hmm.

33:03.675 --> 33:06.242
I had no idea you were a full-on nudist.

33:06.277 --> 33:07.376
Oh, well, now you know.

33:07.412 --> 33:08.711
And thank you

33:08.746 --> 33:10.646
for putting me up for the job,

33:10.682 --> 33:12.481
for being so supportive.

33:12.517 --> 33:14.350
Felt good to be working.

33:14.385 --> 33:16.719
Well, you know I got your back, always.

33:16.754 --> 33:19.522
I heard, um,

33:19.557 --> 33:21.390
you and Sutton fighting...

33:21.426 --> 33:22.425
about me.

33:22.460 --> 33:23.659
Yeah, Adena...

33:23.695 --> 33:25.294
It's okay.

33:25.330 --> 33:26.462
She wasn't wrong.

33:26.497 --> 33:28.497
You know, we are different people.

33:28.533 --> 33:30.433
But we both want you to be happy.

33:30.468 --> 33:34.270
And you're at your happiest
when your friends are too.

33:34.305 --> 33:36.472
And I love that about you.

33:36.507 --> 33:39.442
So don't ever let me come
between you and them, okay?

33:40.745 --> 33:42.511
Okay.

33:42.547 --> 33:44.614
All right.

33:44.649 --> 33:47.416
So what about these sheets, though?

33:47.452 --> 33:49.352
Do they have to keep coming between us?

33:49.387 --> 33:50.553
Oh, they seem unnecessary.

33:50.588 --> 33:52.421
They're so stupid. I hate them.

33:53.240 --> 33:56.292
I hate them so much.

33:58.663 --> 34:00.263
Morning breath.

34:00.298 --> 34:01.497
Oh, I don't care. We're past that.

34:01.532 --> 34:02.565
I'm gonna be late again.

34:13.927 --> 34:16.434
Jacqueline.
Cleo.

34:16.469 --> 34:17.435
Do we have a meeting?

34:17.469 --> 34:18.536
No. No, no.

34:18.571 --> 34:20.705
Just wanted to come and check in.

34:20.739 --> 34:22.606
I heard from the board.

34:22.641 --> 34:24.475
You're doing a letter from
the editor this month?

34:24.510 --> 34:27.610
I am. In fact, I'm planning
on making it a monthly feature.

34:27.647 --> 34:31.449
Oh! You know, this magazine hasn't done
an editor's letter since the '90s.

34:31.484 --> 34:33.551
Well, what's old is new again.

34:33.585 --> 34:35.686
So tell me, what is
this inaugural letter about?

34:35.722 --> 34:38.589
The notion that fit and fat
don't need to be mutually exclusive

34:38.623 --> 34:41.692
and embracing our bodies
is the healthiest thing we can do.

34:43.696 --> 34:46.563
You know, I should thank you.

34:46.599 --> 34:50.368
In trying to figure out the best thing
to replace the "Fit and Fat" story,

34:50.402 --> 34:53.804
I realized that I had some
experiences I wanted to share.

34:53.840 --> 34:56.841
I have not written for a long time.

34:56.876 --> 35:00.778
And getting back to it was invigorating.

35:00.813 --> 35:04.482
Turns out I still have
a lot I want to say.

35:06.586 --> 35:10.354
Well, I cannot wait to see
what you have in store.

35:10.390 --> 35:11.756
I appreciate the support.

35:11.791 --> 35:14.558
Now, if you'll excuse me.

35:29.542 --> 35:31.542
I know it isn't what
you originally pitched.

35:31.577 --> 35:34.345
Oh, and here I thought we
simply had different ideas

35:34.380 --> 35:35.780
of what "candy" meant.

35:38.384 --> 35:39.717
I love them.

35:39.752 --> 35:43.587
I think they're fierce and real

35:43.623 --> 35:46.390
and important.

35:46.426 --> 35:48.426
I think this is what our
readers need to be seeing...

35:48.461 --> 35:50.561
reflections of themselves,
not some airbrushed...

35:50.596 --> 35:52.496
I never said I disagreed.

35:52.532 --> 35:54.398
They're captivating.

35:54.434 --> 35:57.435
And they fit the real-people,
body-positivity theme of this issue.

35:57.470 --> 36:00.404
The photographer is Adena El-Amin.

36:00.440 --> 36:01.472
I don't know her.

36:01.507 --> 36:02.540
You should.

36:02.575 --> 36:03.741
We should use her again.

36:03.776 --> 36:05.509
Well, she's certainly on my radar now,

36:05.545 --> 36:07.545
and maybe we will.

36:10.417 --> 36:12.583
This was very risky, Red.

36:12.618 --> 36:14.351
I know.

36:15.421 --> 36:16.720
Nice work.

36:16.756 --> 36:20.324
I have a model coming in for a fitting.

36:20.359 --> 36:22.393
Why don't you help me
pick out a few looks?

36:37.577 --> 36:38.709
Hi. Good to see you.

36:38.744 --> 36:40.678
I have a meeting with Jacqueline.

36:40.713 --> 36:42.680
Jane.

36:42.715 --> 36:43.747
Hi.

36:43.783 --> 36:45.516
Good to see you. Come on down.

36:58.397 --> 36:59.730
Go ahead and take a seat.

37:02.802 --> 37:07.438
So I saw your interview on NY14.

37:07.473 --> 37:08.706
That was quite a moment.

37:08.741 --> 37:10.374
Yeah, it was.

37:10.409 --> 37:12.676
Victoria doesn't know who she's lost.

37:12.712 --> 37:16.514
Uh, that's actually why
I wanted to talk to you.

37:16.549 --> 37:19.750
Going to "Incite" was...

37:19.785 --> 37:21.352
a huge mistake.

37:21.387 --> 37:22.269
I...

37:22.455 --> 37:23.521
I really screwed up.

37:23.556 --> 37:25.489
No, don't beat yourself up.

37:25.525 --> 37:28.592
If anyone's to blame, it's Victoria.

37:28.628 --> 37:30.528
An editor is supposed
to support their staff,

37:30.563 --> 37:32.563
not exploit them.

37:32.598 --> 37:34.632
Yeah, I know that now.

37:36.636 --> 37:38.702
I took you for granted.

37:38.738 --> 37:42.439
I took for granted
how special "Scarlet" is,

37:42.475 --> 37:46.644
how empowered I felt every day
walking through that lobby,

37:46.679 --> 37:50.648
how challenged I was when you pushed me
outside of my comfort zone,

37:50.683 --> 37:53.651
and the community that you fostered.

37:55.388 --> 37:58.756
It wasn't just a job. It was home.

37:58.791 --> 38:03.627
I left without truly understanding
how lucky I was.

38:05.431 --> 38:10.534
I know that no one has been hired
to replace me yet.

38:14.340 --> 38:15.773
When you left,

38:15.808 --> 38:18.342
the board made an executive decision

38:18.377 --> 38:22.313
to reallocate your salary
towards the relaunch of the dot-com.

38:22.348 --> 38:25.649
I don't have any room in my
budget to bring you back.

38:27.553 --> 38:28.719
Oh.

38:28.754 --> 38:32.423
Okay, um...

38:32.458 --> 38:35.459
well, is there any room
to revisit the issue?

38:35.494 --> 38:36.660
I mean...

38:36.696 --> 38:37.728
you're Jacqueline.

38:37.763 --> 38:39.730
You always get what you want.

38:41.367 --> 38:42.633
I could ask.

38:42.668 --> 38:45.402
And I could...

38:45.438 --> 38:46.670
probably get the money.

38:50.443 --> 38:54.745
But I'm not sure that that
is the best thing for you right now.

38:56.649 --> 38:58.649
You have some growing up to do, Jane.

38:58.684 --> 39:01.485
You need to live in this failure.

39:01.520 --> 39:03.554
You can't be afraid of it.

39:03.589 --> 39:05.389
I'm not here because I'm afraid.

39:05.424 --> 39:07.424
I'm here because I love "Scarlet."

39:07.460 --> 39:10.728
Mm, I think, if you're really
being honest with yourself,

39:10.763 --> 39:12.429
it's both.

39:12.465 --> 39:14.331
You just lost your job,

39:14.367 --> 39:15.466
so you want to feel safe,

39:15.501 --> 39:21.472
and you think that if I fix this,
everything will get right back on track.

39:24.710 --> 39:27.344
Now, I know this is not
what you wanted to hear,

39:27.380 --> 39:28.746
but this is going to be

39:28.781 --> 39:31.582
an invaluable learning
experience for you.

39:39.358 --> 39:41.492
Now I have a meeting.

39:51.637 --> 39:54.371
I believe in you, Jane.

39:57.543 --> 39:59.476
Thank you for taking the time.
