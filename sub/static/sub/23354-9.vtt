WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:04.004
Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares...

00:04.037 --> 00:06.740
Chef Ramsay heads
to Boca Raton, Florida

00:06.773 --> 00:09.309
and finds a chef-owner who
is much better at fighting...

00:09.343 --> 00:11.578
When people talk
about my food,

00:11.612 --> 00:13.347
- Yeah, that pisses me off.
- Then cooking.

00:13.380 --> 00:14.748
He was lucky I didn't
hit him with something.

00:14.781 --> 00:16.116
I was that close.

00:16.149 --> 00:17.985
From the minute
Chef Ramsay steps foot

00:18.018 --> 00:19.520
in Anna Vincenzo's...

00:19.553 --> 00:20.954
Ah, you know a lot of people
said you were a jerk.

00:20.988 --> 00:22.489
I think I believe it.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.958
Cece battles Gordon
every step of the way.

00:24.992 --> 00:27.794
the food or the attitude.

00:27.828 --> 00:30.000
This hotheaded chef
seems incapable

00:30.000 --> 00:30.230
This hotheaded chef
seems incapable

00:30.264 --> 00:31.832
of taking any criticism.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.635
He's British and he doesn't know
anything about pizza.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.069
But Gordon's not the only one

00:36.103 --> 00:37.471
Who suffers her wrath.

00:37.504 --> 00:39.540
Can I get some
service back here?

00:39.573 --> 00:42.910
Cece rules her restaurant
with an iron fist.

00:42.943 --> 00:45.479
And nobody dares
stand up to her.

00:45.512 --> 00:47.247
Here's your!
Jeez!

00:47.281 --> 00:48.348
Not her staff...

00:48.382 --> 00:49.883
Cece always seems
to point the finger

00:49.917 --> 00:50.918
in the other direction.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.286
And not her husband.

00:52.319 --> 00:53.487
Can you get
out of my way?

00:53.520 --> 00:54.855
Well, life for Cece

00:54.888 --> 00:57.291
is about to take
a dramatic turn.

00:59.259 --> 01:00.000
As Chef Ramsay
tries everything

01:00.000 --> 01:01.194
As Chef Ramsay
tries everything

01:01.228 --> 01:02.329
to get through to her.

01:02.362 --> 01:03.664
I'm not here to get
cross-examined by you.

01:03.697 --> 01:05.599
Let's get that right.

01:05.632 --> 01:07.868
She may have asked for his help
to save her restaurant...

01:07.901 --> 01:09.269
And he's supposed to be here
to help me.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.371
He's not supposed to be telling
me that nothing's good.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.407
But her unwillingness
to change...

01:13.440 --> 01:14.942
You're off the wall
with what you're saying.

01:14.975 --> 01:16.443
Or even listen...

01:16.476 --> 01:17.911
I just don't even want
to hear it right now.

01:17.945 --> 01:19.379
May push Chef Ramsay
over the edge....

01:19.413 --> 01:21.915
None of you have seen me
go  crazy yet!

01:21.949 --> 01:23.483
And right out the door.

01:23.517 --> 01:24.851
What a sad case.

01:46.206 --> 01:48.208
Boca Raton, Florida.

01:48.241 --> 01:50.811
A wealthy community
filled with stately homes,

01:50.844 --> 01:52.412
luxurious golf courses,

01:52.446 --> 01:54.881
and miles
of picturesque beaches.

01:54.915 --> 01:57.718
It's this good life that
attracted Cece and her family

01:57.751 --> 02:00.000
to move here from New York
ten years ago.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.253
to move here from New York
ten years ago.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.756
Hi. What a good girl.
Mwah!

02:02.789 --> 02:05.659
Her father, a former
pizzeria owner,

02:05.692 --> 02:09.496
helped Cece open
Anna Vincenzo's in 2001.

02:09.529 --> 02:14.001
My father gave me over $300,000
to open up Anna Vincenzo's.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.002
My father's been
in the restaurant business

02:16.035 --> 02:17.803
since before I was born.

02:17.837 --> 02:18.938
And I've always been
around a kitchen

02:18.971 --> 02:21.073
since I was a baby.

02:21.107 --> 02:23.509
Okay, pumpkin, bye.
I love you.

02:23.543 --> 02:25.945
Now Cece is raising
her own family

02:25.978 --> 02:26.979
along with her husband,

02:27.013 --> 02:28.414
and facing
the challenging demands

02:28.447 --> 02:30.000
of being owner and head chef
of Anna Vincenzo's.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.384
of being owner and head chef
of Anna Vincenzo's.

02:31.417 --> 02:33.486
Welcome to Anna Vincenzo's.
How are you tonight?
Good.

02:33.519 --> 02:35.288
Two veal piccatas,
please!

02:35.321 --> 02:37.657
I'm a self-taught cook.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.725
Veal Marsala,
quatro formaggi.

02:39.759 --> 02:41.894
I don't think there's
any rules in cooking.

02:41.928 --> 02:43.462
My menu, I cook
what I like.

02:43.496 --> 02:46.132
Chicken Marsala,
padrino, snapper Anna.

02:46.165 --> 02:48.668
I am passionate
about what I do.

02:48.701 --> 02:51.003
Can you tell Michael
to pick up his  calamari?

02:51.037 --> 02:52.038
Wherever they go.

02:52.071 --> 02:54.073
After I opened,
business was insane.

02:54.106 --> 02:55.575
It was fun to come to work.

02:55.608 --> 02:58.544
The adrenaline's going
and it's fun, it's great.

02:58.578 --> 02:59.845
And you make money.

02:59.879 --> 03:00.000
Some more lasagna?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.147
Some more lasagna?

03:01.180 --> 03:03.449
Oh, no, thanks.
No?

03:03.482 --> 03:05.718
About two year ago,
it started to change.

03:05.751 --> 03:07.320
Let's see,
everything that you could

03:07.353 --> 03:09.188
possibly think of went wrong
has gone wrong.

03:09.221 --> 03:12.191
I don't really know why
or what happened.

03:12.224 --> 03:13.593
That looks like.

03:13.626 --> 03:16.262
When it's slow,
I don't even want to come here.

03:16.295 --> 03:18.097
I've lost my desire
to come.

03:18.130 --> 03:19.298
I don't know how
to cook snapper.

03:19.332 --> 03:20.566
Maybe it's not
cooked enough.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.934
To be honest, I got to say

03:21.968 --> 03:23.035
Cece's probably
the biggest reason

03:23.069 --> 03:24.604
why we're having trouble
right now.

03:24.637 --> 03:25.771
Okay, forget it.

03:25.805 --> 03:27.273
Let's go to another
table.

03:27.306 --> 03:28.574
She never really
cares what's going out.

03:28.608 --> 03:30.000
Why is this still here?
Table 42!

03:30.000 --> 03:31.043
Why is this still here?
Table 42!

03:31.077 --> 03:33.045
She'll serve crap
to a table.

03:33.079 --> 03:34.880
It's not cooked.

03:34.914 --> 03:36.816
When she gets mad,
she's aggressive

03:36.849 --> 03:37.850
and angry.

03:37.883 --> 03:39.485
Here's your.

03:39.518 --> 03:40.653
Tell everybody to
go home.

03:40.686 --> 03:41.721
I'm shutting
the place down.

03:41.754 --> 03:43.556
Yeah, Cece
has to be hurting

03:43.589 --> 03:45.157
now that business
is going bad.

03:45.191 --> 03:48.427
There's no customers left.

03:48.461 --> 03:49.762
I don't know
what happened to them.

03:49.795 --> 03:52.465
Where did they go?

03:52.498 --> 03:54.100
As of right now, I--

03:54.133 --> 03:57.670
I'm in debt about $190,000
to my father.

03:57.703 --> 03:59.705
I stay up at night
just thinking,

03:59.739 --> 04:00.000
how am I gonna
give him his money?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.807
how am I gonna
give him his money?

04:01.841 --> 04:03.576
There's like nobody
coming here,

04:03.609 --> 04:06.779
and five tables we have,
and everything's ed up!

04:06.812 --> 04:08.014
It's so hard for me

04:08.047 --> 04:09.382
to see my daughter
losing money every day...

04:13.653 --> 04:15.121
I love you.

04:15.154 --> 04:16.255
It is very stressful

04:16.288 --> 04:18.658
and very difficult
for Cece.

04:18.691 --> 04:21.894
Now that we have a son,
the restaurant has to work

04:21.927 --> 04:22.928
for our personal lives,

04:22.962 --> 04:24.697
just--just to even live.

04:26.599 --> 04:27.767
I'm a failure.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.235
I'm afraid we're gonna
lose our house.

04:29.268 --> 04:30.000
I always tell Michael
I'm afraid

04:30.000 --> 04:30.803
I always tell Michael
I'm afraid

04:30.836 --> 04:32.238
we're not gonna be able
to feed the baby.

04:32.271 --> 04:34.273
Hi! Hey.

04:34.306 --> 04:36.676
I have, like, a weight
on my shoulders that, you know,

04:36.709 --> 04:38.911
weighs 1,000 pounds.

04:38.944 --> 04:40.780
And that kills me.

04:40.813 --> 04:42.314
Oh, my God.

04:42.348 --> 04:44.583
Chef Ramsay's
my last hope.

04:55.127 --> 04:56.996
Anna Vincenzo's.

05:00.332 --> 05:03.002
Wow.
Hello.

05:03.035 --> 05:04.036
Hello.
How are you?

05:04.070 --> 05:05.738
Good. How are you?
Anna Vincenzo.

05:05.771 --> 05:07.773
Anna Vincenzo's the restaurant.
I'm Cece.

05:07.807 --> 05:08.841
You're Cece.
Nice to meet you.

05:08.874 --> 05:09.909
Would you like to eat?

05:09.942 --> 05:11.010
Uh, yeah.

05:11.043 --> 05:12.411
Okay.
Good to see you.
Thank you.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.280
I would say that he
should like everything.

05:14.313 --> 05:15.381
There's really nothing
on there

05:15.414 --> 05:16.749
that I make
that I don't like.

05:16.782 --> 05:18.451
This is your restaurant?

05:18.484 --> 05:20.486
Correct.
Yeah, you're the owner?

05:20.519 --> 05:21.987
And by the look
of the state of the apron,

05:22.021 --> 05:23.723
the chef as well.

05:23.756 --> 05:24.757
Yep!

05:24.790 --> 05:25.958
And where have you
learned to cook?

05:25.991 --> 05:27.526
My father had a restaurant

05:27.560 --> 05:28.594
since before I was born.

05:28.627 --> 05:29.595
Wow.

05:29.628 --> 05:30.000
So I was raised, uh,

05:30.000 --> 05:30.830
So I was raised, uh,

05:30.863 --> 05:32.231
pretty much in the kitchen.

05:32.264 --> 05:34.133
There's a line cook
over there

05:34.166 --> 05:35.668
with white hair
that keeps on staring at me.

05:35.701 --> 05:37.536
Is he all right?

05:37.570 --> 05:38.571
That's my father!

05:38.604 --> 05:40.406
He works for you?

05:40.439 --> 05:42.374
Yes, and my husband
is head server.

05:42.408 --> 05:43.476
Oh, your husband's
here as well?

05:43.509 --> 05:44.944
Yeah, he helps me out

05:44.977 --> 05:46.545
because, uh, we need it.

05:46.579 --> 05:47.580
Where is he?
You wanna meet him?

05:47.613 --> 05:48.848
I'd love to meet
your husband.

05:48.881 --> 05:50.583
I'll get him.
Michael!

05:50.616 --> 05:51.617
Yes?

05:51.650 --> 05:54.620
Um, Mr...

05:54.653 --> 05:56.055
Chef Ramsay
wants to meet you.

05:56.088 --> 05:58.124
Well, Michael.
There he is.

05:58.157 --> 05:59.225
I can't believe it.

05:59.258 --> 06:00.000
Good to see you.
Thank you very much.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.292
Good to see you.
Thank you very much.

06:00.326 --> 06:01.327
Uh, look nice and smart.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.995
You dress like this
normal for work or--

06:03.028 --> 06:05.231
I always like to look
nice for the guests, so...

06:05.264 --> 06:07.032
You look like you're gonna
do a hit after dinner.

06:08.134 --> 06:09.034
Huh?

06:09.068 --> 06:10.102
You never know.

06:10.136 --> 06:12.605
I, uh, sweat
a little extra

06:12.638 --> 06:14.640
just to look nice
for the customers.

06:14.673 --> 06:16.242
I gotta get back
into the kitchen.

06:16.275 --> 06:18.043
Ashton.
How are you?

06:18.077 --> 06:19.145
I'm doing good.
How are you doing?

06:19.178 --> 06:20.212
Very well, thank you.
Good to see you too.

06:20.246 --> 06:21.914
I guess we'll be
talking to each other.

06:21.947 --> 06:22.915
Oh, yes.

06:22.948 --> 06:25.117
Oh, good.
Right, Ashton...

06:25.151 --> 06:26.619
I'll take
one of everything.

06:26.652 --> 06:28.487
One of everything?
Yeah.

06:28.521 --> 06:29.622
One ofeverything?

06:29.655 --> 06:30.000
Why not? Great way
of really getting to see

06:30.000 --> 06:32.324
Why not? Great way
of really getting to see

06:32.358 --> 06:34.193
each and every dish,
understanding the flavors,

06:34.226 --> 06:36.462
and getting a touch of that
authentic Italian cuisine.

06:36.495 --> 06:37.830
One of everything
on the menu?

06:37.863 --> 06:38.964
Yes, please.
Okay!

06:38.998 --> 06:41.267
Thank you, darling.
You're welcome.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.869
The Anna Vincenzo menu
is gi-normous.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.605
He must be insane, 'cause
we're gonna be here all day.

06:46.639 --> 06:48.040
He wants
one of everything.

06:48.073 --> 06:49.041
What happened?

06:49.074 --> 06:50.743
He said he wants
one of everything.

06:50.776 --> 06:52.411
Just say to him,
"Let me understand:

06:52.444 --> 06:53.979
You want one thing
on the whole entire--"

06:54.013 --> 06:57.082
So Cece wants to clarify that
you do want one of everything.

06:57.116 --> 06:58.951
'Cause I hope he hasn't
eaten in a week.

06:58.984 --> 07:00.000
Ahh.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.419
Ahh.

07:00.452 --> 07:01.487
Ay, yi yi yi.

07:01.520 --> 07:04.089
This is gonna be
harder than I thought.

07:04.123 --> 07:06.358
Cece says she hopes
you haven't eaten in a week.

07:06.392 --> 07:07.860
It's a big menu.
Have you seen it?

07:07.893 --> 07:09.762
I haven't seen the menu.
Have a quick look?

07:09.795 --> 07:11.130
Yes.

07:11.163 --> 07:13.365
Ohh, what did I
get myself into?

07:13.399 --> 07:15.234
It's quite large.

07:15.267 --> 07:16.535
Yeah, like that's just--

07:16.569 --> 07:19.205
1, 2, 3--Oh, my God.

07:19.238 --> 07:21.540
It's that big?
How many dishes are on there?

07:21.574 --> 07:22.775
A lot,
then you have--

07:22.808 --> 07:24.009
Look at it!
Mm-hmm.

07:24.043 --> 07:25.444
Ay, yi.

07:25.477 --> 07:26.579
That was a joke,
by the way.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.114
I hadn't even
looked at the menu.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.281
I figured that.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.000
There must be hundreds
of dishes on there.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.483
There must be hundreds
of dishes on there.

07:30.516 --> 07:31.818
Now, if you haven't eaten
for a while,

07:31.851 --> 07:33.152
I'll be more than happy
to prepare that.

07:33.152 --> 07:35.387
Let me have a look at the menu,
and I'll order, yes?

07:35.421 --> 07:37.122
I was like,
"Oh, thank God."

07:37.156 --> 07:39.124
Okay, so I'm ready
to order, thank you.

07:39.158 --> 07:40.225
All right.

07:40.226 --> 07:41.460
So I would like
to start off with...

07:41.461 --> 07:44.497
Salmon divino.
Thank you.

07:44.497 --> 07:46.565
And then throw in
the, uh, snapper Anna.

07:46.599 --> 07:48.234
Snapper Anna?
Yeah.

07:48.267 --> 07:49.468
The favorito del nonna.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.837
Yeah?

07:50.870 --> 07:52.138
Thank you.
You're welcome.

07:52.171 --> 07:53.172
Wow.

07:54.507 --> 07:56.075
Okay, here we go.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.878
You got
a salmon divino ready?

08:01.047 --> 08:03.015
Here's your
salmon divino salad.

08:03.049 --> 08:05.318
Wow, this looks like
a -up version

08:05.351 --> 08:06.986
of a science lab.

08:07.019 --> 08:08.154
Thank you.
You're welcome.

08:08.187 --> 08:09.522
Wow.

08:11.357 --> 08:13.025
Salmon is dry.

08:16.529 --> 08:17.697
And overcooked.

08:19.031 --> 08:20.566
Where the
did she get that thing?

08:20.600 --> 08:22.735
Huh?
What is that?

08:26.272 --> 08:27.440
Do they paste that
together in the morning

08:27.473 --> 08:28.441
and stick it together?

08:28.474 --> 08:29.809
Sliced it just now.

08:29.842 --> 08:30.000
And is the salmon fresh,
or is that frozen?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.544
And is the salmon fresh,
or is that frozen?

08:31.577 --> 08:33.045
Um, I couldn't tell you,
to be honest.

08:33.079 --> 08:34.814
Would you ask her,
'cause it tastes frozen.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.182
Okay, let me go ask.
Thank you.

08:36.215 --> 08:37.850
He wants to know if your
salmon's fresh or frozen.

08:37.884 --> 08:41.220
Tell him it's fresh,
but it is frozen.

08:42.922 --> 08:44.156
She said the salmon
comes in fresh,

08:44.190 --> 08:45.691
and then they freeze it.

08:45.725 --> 08:47.426
It's like eating
a piece of cardboard there.

08:47.460 --> 08:50.830
That has to be Florida's
worst dish ever.

08:52.298 --> 08:53.933
He said
the salmon divino...

08:53.966 --> 08:54.901
He said what?

08:54.934 --> 08:56.035
Tastes like cardboard.

08:56.068 --> 08:57.870
He's supposed
to be here to help me.

08:57.904 --> 08:59.739
He's not supposed to be telling
me that nothing's good.

08:59.772 --> 09:00.000
Give me the snapper Anna.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.741
Give me the snapper Anna.

09:01.774 --> 09:03.242
If he complains about this,

09:03.276 --> 09:05.645
I'm really gonna
kick his ass.

09:05.678 --> 09:08.214
My God.
And there's
the snapper Anna for you.

09:08.247 --> 09:09.982
The snapper Anna?
Mm-hmm.

09:10.016 --> 09:11.751
Just out of interest,
where is the snapper?

09:11.784 --> 09:12.952
Well, under all that.

09:12.985 --> 09:15.288
Under all that.
All right.

09:15.321 --> 09:17.623
This one looks like a, uh,
a dog's dinner.

09:17.657 --> 09:19.792
I don't know how well
this is gonna work.

09:19.825 --> 09:21.661
My God.

09:21.694 --> 09:23.930
I just tasted mush.

09:23.963 --> 09:25.264
Is Michael nearby?

09:25.298 --> 09:26.566
I'll get him for you.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.000
Um, just taste that
for me, would you?

09:30.000 --> 09:30.002
Um, just taste that
for me, would you?

09:30.036 --> 09:32.538
Please?
That's the snapper Anna.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.308
It's soggy.

09:35.341 --> 09:37.577
Should be baked
a little longer.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.679
That is  disgusting.

09:39.712 --> 09:41.514
Yes, sir.

09:41.547 --> 09:42.949
Thank you.
Would you do me a favor?

09:42.982 --> 09:44.650
Will you make sure
that Cece tastes that, yeah?

09:44.684 --> 09:45.785
I think
it's really important.

09:45.818 --> 09:47.753
All right.
Thank you.

09:47.787 --> 09:49.555
What did he say?

09:49.556 --> 09:51.124
For you taste.

09:51.157 --> 09:52.292
Taste what?

09:52.325 --> 09:53.660
He says it's soggy.

09:53.693 --> 09:55.061
I'm not eat--
he touched it.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.462
I'm not gonna
put my mouth on that.

09:56.462 --> 09:58.297
The snapper was soft.

09:58.330 --> 10:00.000
Well, what the hell
you want it to be?

10:00.000 --> 10:00.065
Well, what the hell
you want it to be?

10:00.099 --> 10:01.634
Hard, like a rock?

10:01.667 --> 10:03.135
I mean,
I don't even get that.

10:03.168 --> 10:04.436
Tell him, "You know what?

10:04.470 --> 10:05.804
Cece doesn't even
want to cook you the rest."

10:05.838 --> 10:07.039
Now I'm really getting
pissed off, I'm not kidding.

10:07.072 --> 10:08.040
She's getting mad.

10:08.073 --> 10:09.308
Does she always
shout like that?

10:09.341 --> 10:10.476
Huh?

10:10.509 --> 10:11.977
Tell him that I said

10:12.011 --> 10:13.379
there's starving people
in the world,

10:13.412 --> 10:15.481
and if I have to keep making
food to go in the garbage,

10:15.514 --> 10:16.649
I don't want
to make anymore.

10:16.682 --> 10:18.050
Right now, or when
I bring in the next--

10:18.083 --> 10:19.852
No, right now!

10:22.087 --> 10:23.589
him, why should
I make him anything else?

10:25.991 --> 10:28.727
Cece said that there's
starving people in the world--

10:28.761 --> 10:30.000
Let me just stop you there
for two seconds.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.362
Let me just stop you there
for two seconds.

10:30.396 --> 10:31.664
She got something
to tell me,

10:31.697 --> 10:34.033
she should come
and tell me herself.
Okay.

10:34.066 --> 10:35.100
I don't think it's fair

10:35.134 --> 10:36.502
that you have to do
her dirty work for her.

10:36.535 --> 10:37.903
So tell Cece,
when she's finished cooking,

10:37.937 --> 10:39.572
she can tell me
everything she wants.

10:39.605 --> 10:41.640
Until then, I'm here
to eat and to taste the food.

10:41.674 --> 10:42.708
I'll tell her.
I appreciate that.

10:42.741 --> 10:43.876
Okay.
Thank you so much.

10:43.909 --> 10:45.144
You're welcome.

10:45.177 --> 10:47.413
I didn't want to tell
Cece the truth at all

10:47.446 --> 10:48.981
about anything he said.

10:49.014 --> 10:50.549
She's gonna
probably kill me.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.785
She's gonna kill the messenger
before she kills

10:52.818 --> 10:54.019
Gordon Ramsay.

10:54.053 --> 10:55.054
What'd he say?

10:56.689 --> 10:59.491
He said just, later,
you can tell him yourself.

10:59.525 --> 11:00.000
But right now, he wants
to try and eat everything.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.660
But right now, he wants
to try and eat everything.

11:01.694 --> 11:04.063
So he is a bigger
than I thought.

11:04.096 --> 11:05.664
him.
What?

11:05.698 --> 11:07.266
- him.
- him?

11:11.036 --> 11:12.338
Here's your pizza.

11:12.371 --> 11:13.672
Thank you, darling.

11:13.706 --> 11:15.140
And which one is the--

11:15.174 --> 11:16.542
That's the favorito del nonna.

11:16.575 --> 11:17.977
Pizza's an honor.
Lovely.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.212
I don't care how many
stars he has.

11:20.245 --> 11:22.514
He can kiss my stars.

11:25.117 --> 11:27.052
I'm so pissed off
right now.

11:27.086 --> 11:28.387
That's just not nice.

11:28.420 --> 11:29.555
Soggy in the middle.

11:29.588 --> 11:30.000
And crispy on the outside.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.023
And crispy on the outside.

11:31.056 --> 11:33.058
It's dreadful.
What a shame.

11:33.092 --> 11:35.327
It's a bit plain.
Boring. Yeah.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.229
Bland.
Thank you.

11:37.262 --> 11:38.263
Can I go over there
and scream at him?

11:38.297 --> 11:40.766
Yeah, take
your knife with you.

11:42.568 --> 11:44.503
I tried to throw it in
the garbage before she saw me,

11:44.536 --> 11:46.205
'cause I knew
she was gonna flip.

11:48.807 --> 11:52.244
Oh, no  way!
What's wrong with that now?

11:52.277 --> 11:54.013
He said it was bland.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.180
Oh, my God!

11:55.214 --> 11:57.483
He said it needed
more flavors to it.

11:57.516 --> 11:59.685
I was so mad at him,
I wanted to rip his head off.

11:59.718 --> 12:00.000
He's British, he doesn't
know anything about pizza.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.322
He's British, he doesn't
know anything about pizza.

12:03.355 --> 12:04.990
Coming up...

12:05.024 --> 12:06.425
He's lucky I didn't
hit him with something.

12:06.458 --> 12:08.327
If you thought lunch
was bad...

12:08.360 --> 12:09.628
Are we gonna
be able to cook,

12:09.662 --> 12:10.963
or are you gonna
keep busting my balls?

12:10.996 --> 12:12.631
You haven't seen anything yet.

12:12.665 --> 12:14.400
Don't  with me.

12:14.433 --> 12:17.036
As things at Anna Vincenzo's
go from bad to worse.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.104
I can't do it anymore.
I'm done.

12:19.138 --> 12:20.506
Cece is on the warpath.

12:20.539 --> 12:22.908
Can I get some
service back here?

12:22.941 --> 12:24.943
And Chef Ramsay
is the enemy.

12:24.977 --> 12:25.911
You have
an attitude problem.

12:25.944 --> 12:27.246
This stubborn chef

12:27.279 --> 12:28.947
May have
wanted Gordon's help...

12:28.981 --> 12:30.000
He's a pig-headed
British jerk.

12:30.000 --> 12:30.983
He's a pig-headed
British jerk.

12:31.016 --> 12:33.218
But now she wants him
out the door.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.253
Can you get out of my way?

12:34.286 --> 12:35.854
Shut it down.

12:35.888 --> 12:38.290
Find out what sends Gordon
out the front door...

12:38.323 --> 12:39.491
What a sad case.

12:39.525 --> 12:40.993
And Cece out the back.

12:41.026 --> 12:42.795
I've had it,
I'm finished, I'm done.

12:42.828 --> 12:44.563
On a combative
Kitchen Nightmares

12:44.596 --> 12:46.065
You have to see
to believe.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.133
This is my life!

12:55.192 --> 12:56.293
After a terrible lunch...

12:56.327 --> 12:58.362
This is dreadful.
What a shame.

12:58.395 --> 13:00.764
Chef Ramsay is ready
to give his input.

13:00.797 --> 13:03.133
But this owner doesn't appear
ready to listen.

13:03.166 --> 13:04.768
Let's start from
the top, shall we?

13:04.801 --> 13:06.436
Sure, let's start.
The salmon...

13:06.470 --> 13:08.972
Yeah.
Yeah? Hideous.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.941
The decoration
with the cucumber--

13:10.974 --> 13:12.709
Everybody loves
that salad.

13:12.742 --> 13:15.245
Who's "everybody"?
The restaurant's empty.

13:15.278 --> 13:17.814
Okay, the snapper--
bitterly disappointed.

13:17.848 --> 13:20.217
It was macerated
in crap and mozzarella

13:20.250 --> 13:20.603
and didn't even
taste of snapper.

13:20.603 --> 13:21.985
and didn't even
taste of snapper.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.787
That's.

13:23.820 --> 13:25.288
Yeah. You didn't
taste the snapper

13:25.322 --> 13:26.456
with the mozzarella on top?

13:26.490 --> 13:27.657
What's wrong with that?

13:27.691 --> 13:28.959
I asked Michael to make sure
that you tasted it.

13:28.992 --> 13:30.527
I'm not gonna eat
something off your plate.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.229
You are a piece of work,
aren't you?

13:32.262 --> 13:33.730
Yes, I am.

13:33.763 --> 13:35.031
When people talk
about my food,

13:35.065 --> 13:36.066
Yeah, that pisses me off.

13:36.099 --> 13:37.367
Where's Michael?

13:37.400 --> 13:39.169
What difference does it make
where  Michael is?

13:39.202 --> 13:40.303
He's got nothing
to do with this!

13:40.337 --> 13:41.771
He tasted it.
And what did he say?

13:41.805 --> 13:42.839
He said it was mush.

13:42.873 --> 13:44.508
Are you  kidding me?

13:44.541 --> 13:45.609
Where is he?

13:45.642 --> 13:47.244
I don't like
being criticized at all.

13:47.277 --> 13:48.578
Maybe he's talking
out of hisbum,

13:48.612 --> 13:50.603
as they say in--
in England.

13:50.603 --> 13:50.914
as they say in--
in England.

13:50.947 --> 13:53.550
You said the  fish
was mush?

13:53.583 --> 13:55.752
No, it was tender, the way
everybody else enjoys it.

13:55.785 --> 13:57.487
There it was tender!

13:57.521 --> 14:00.023
Michael, are you honestly
trying to tell me

14:00.056 --> 14:01.625
that you're now saying
that it was perfectly cooked?

14:01.658 --> 14:02.726
It's soggy.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.694
It should be baked
a little longer.

14:04.728 --> 14:07.030
It was a little bit
on the softer side.

14:07.063 --> 14:08.098
A little bit
on the softer side?

14:08.131 --> 14:09.266
Right.

14:09.299 --> 14:10.367
I'm not expecting you
to stand there

14:10.400 --> 14:11.601
and stick up for me
but, trust me,

14:11.635 --> 14:14.170
the food was overcooked,
and it was bland and mush.

14:14.204 --> 14:16.773
There's nothing wrong
with that snapper.

14:16.806 --> 14:18.708
I think it was very foolish
and very hard-headed

14:18.742 --> 14:19.943
that she wouldn't listen.

14:19.976 --> 14:20.603
I was like,
oh, what are you doing?

14:20.603 --> 14:21.111
I was like,
oh, what are you doing?

14:21.144 --> 14:22.445
What's with
the defense mechanism?

14:22.479 --> 14:24.314
Oh, my God.
Huh?

14:24.347 --> 14:25.582
Don't you get defensive

14:25.615 --> 14:27.117
if somebody comments
about your food like that?

14:27.150 --> 14:28.251
I don't cook
like that.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.088
When was the last time

14:32.122 --> 14:33.890
a customer complained
about the food?

14:33.924 --> 14:35.859
Well, last night.

14:35.892 --> 14:36.960
Mm-hmm, and what
did they say?

14:36.993 --> 14:38.528
It was bland.

14:38.562 --> 14:39.596
And were they right
or were they wrong?

14:39.629 --> 14:41.765
No, they were right, but...

14:41.798 --> 14:43.667
You're off the wall
with what you're saying.

14:43.700 --> 14:44.634
Here's the difference
between you and me.

14:44.668 --> 14:46.803
I listen for feedback.

14:46.836 --> 14:48.038
You can't handle it.

14:49.172 --> 14:50.603
I came here
because you asked me

14:50.603 --> 14:50.640
I came here
because you asked me

14:50.674 --> 14:52.175
to come and help you.

14:52.208 --> 14:53.209
And your reaction to me

14:53.243 --> 14:54.511
telling you something
quite constructive,

14:54.544 --> 14:56.813
in a very calm manner,
is a joke.

14:56.846 --> 14:58.348
Okay, so you want me
to be your  puppet--

14:58.381 --> 14:59.549
Why are you shouting?

14:59.583 --> 15:01.318
Because you're pissing me
the  off!

15:01.351 --> 15:03.920
So shut the  up
and talk properly.

15:03.954 --> 15:05.455
Is this the way you react
when I'm not here?

15:05.488 --> 15:07.724
Is this the normal procedure
when--it is, yeah?

15:07.757 --> 15:09.259
Oh, you're gonna get
your  ass kicked.

15:09.292 --> 15:10.293
Oh, there you go.

15:10.327 --> 15:11.895
Madame, you have
an attitude problem.

15:11.928 --> 15:13.997
I'm not too sure
which is worse:

15:14.030 --> 15:15.599
the food or the attitude.

15:17.167 --> 15:18.935
Ooh, can I hit him now?

15:20.737 --> 15:21.871
You know, a lot of people
said you were a jerk.

15:21.905 --> 15:23.907
I think I believe it.

15:23.940 --> 15:24.941
Anything else?

15:27.377 --> 15:29.045
this.

15:32.549 --> 15:34.017
No  way.

15:34.050 --> 15:35.919
What a sad case.

15:35.952 --> 15:37.020
Am I supposed to run after him

15:37.053 --> 15:38.855
And say, "Oh, please
come and help me"?

15:38.888 --> 15:40.190
Well,  you.

15:40.223 --> 15:41.591
He's lucky I didn't
hit him with something.

15:41.625 --> 15:42.826
I was that close.

15:48.264 --> 15:50.433
In spite of his rude welcoming,

15:50.467 --> 15:50.603
Gordon decides to give Cece
another chance

15:50.603 --> 15:52.736
Gordon decides to give Cece
another chance

15:52.769 --> 15:54.504
and returns to the restaurant

15:54.537 --> 15:57.340
to observe Cece
and her staff in action

15:57.374 --> 15:58.508
during a dinner service.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.777
Right...so...

16:00.810 --> 16:02.379
What do you keep in here?

16:02.412 --> 16:04.648
Tartufos,
our gnocchi.

16:04.681 --> 16:05.682
And who makes the gnocchi?

16:05.715 --> 16:07.550
Uh, we used
to make them ourselves,

16:07.584 --> 16:08.618
but we buy them now.

16:08.652 --> 16:09.719
They look
definitely frozen.

16:11.521 --> 16:12.989
And what are these
little babies here?
Meatballs.

16:13.023 --> 16:15.558
They're a little,
uh, overcooked.

16:15.592 --> 16:16.893
And when they're that
overcooked,

16:16.926 --> 16:18.061
would you serve them?

16:18.094 --> 16:20.603
We can't just
throw them away.

16:20.603 --> 16:20.664
We can't just
throw them away.

16:20.697 --> 16:21.665
They smell like cat food.

16:21.698 --> 16:22.932
Cat food?

16:22.966 --> 16:25.301
That smells like an authentic
meatball to you?

16:25.335 --> 16:26.569
Well, I don't have cats,

16:26.603 --> 16:27.837
so I don't know
what cat foods smell like.

16:27.871 --> 16:29.539
Oh, my God.

16:29.572 --> 16:30.607
Are we gonna be able to cook?

16:30.640 --> 16:31.808
Or are you gonna
keep busting my balls?

16:33.910 --> 16:35.912
I swear to God, I'm not here
to get cross-examined by you.

16:35.945 --> 16:36.913
Let's get that right, yeah?

16:36.946 --> 16:38.048
There's only one person

16:38.081 --> 16:39.115
that's gonna be
losing out on this,

16:39.149 --> 16:40.884
and it's certainly not me,
okay?

16:40.917 --> 16:42.619
So don't  with me.

16:42.652 --> 16:45.088
I really want to prove
to that pig-headed British jerk

16:45.121 --> 16:46.389
that I can do it.

16:46.423 --> 16:47.557
Nice.

16:49.893 --> 16:50.603
Hi, welcome
to Anna Vincenzo's.

16:50.603 --> 16:51.561
Hi, welcome
to Anna Vincenzo's.

16:51.594 --> 16:52.629
We're gonna
go right this way.

16:53.797 --> 16:55.799
We'll sit
right over here, guys.

16:55.832 --> 16:57.300
Who wants to go first?

16:57.333 --> 16:59.202
Can I get
a chicken parm?
Chicken parm?

16:59.235 --> 17:00.637
You want veal piccata?
Very good.

17:00.670 --> 17:02.172
Thank you.

17:02.205 --> 17:03.573
You ready?
Yes, please.

17:03.606 --> 17:04.808
Rigatoni vodka
with chicken.

17:04.841 --> 17:06.543
A rigatoni angelino.

17:06.576 --> 17:08.144
A fettuccine alfredo.

17:08.178 --> 17:10.080
Veal piccata,
fried veal chops.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.282
Table 11.

17:13.583 --> 17:15.218
Can somebody
pick up this food?

17:17.253 --> 17:20.603
Can I get some
service back here?

17:20.603 --> 17:21.057
Can I get some
service back here?

17:21.058 --> 17:22.091
Cece always seems
to point the finger

17:22.125 --> 17:23.159
in the other direction.

17:23.192 --> 17:25.228
She's always
blaming the servers.

17:25.261 --> 17:26.396
She never once
thought maybe

17:26.429 --> 17:27.830
there was something wrong
with herself.

17:27.864 --> 17:29.966
Get that  out
of the window, please!

17:29.999 --> 17:31.501
Ouch.

17:31.534 --> 17:33.836
Cece pushes the first orders
out quickly,

17:33.870 --> 17:35.037
But her customers...

17:35.071 --> 17:36.739
Okay, we have
the grilled chicken?

17:36.773 --> 17:38.775
Are unhappy
with what they received.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.510
The veal has no flavor
at all.

17:40.543 --> 17:41.577
I'm sorry about that.

17:41.611 --> 17:43.446
I'll be back to get
those plates, okay?

17:43.479 --> 17:45.214
What happened there?

17:45.248 --> 17:49.118
They said there's just like
one giant chunk of it there.

17:49.152 --> 17:50.603
That's what happens when
you use frozen food

17:50.603 --> 17:51.020
That's what happens when
you use frozen food

17:51.053 --> 17:52.488
and dip it in flour

17:52.522 --> 17:54.190
that was not even shaken off
before it goes in the fryer.

17:54.223 --> 17:55.958
Do you tell Cece that
now, or--

17:55.992 --> 17:57.026
Um, I'm afraid to,

17:57.059 --> 17:58.227
'cause she's so busy.

17:58.261 --> 18:00.296
She needs to know,
trust me.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.731
Cece, the customers
are saying

18:01.764 --> 18:03.032
that they're too chunky.

18:03.065 --> 18:05.568
Like they're just
like one giant piece.

18:05.601 --> 18:07.236
The calamari
was in a big clump.

18:07.270 --> 18:08.471
I saw that.

18:08.504 --> 18:09.572
Do you expect people

18:09.605 --> 18:10.673
to pay money for that
and eat that?

18:10.706 --> 18:11.707
Come on!

18:11.741 --> 18:12.775
Why don't I just
work by myself

18:12.809 --> 18:14.310
and fire all these
people?

18:14.343 --> 18:15.945
You think I can
handle it by myself?

18:17.180 --> 18:19.582
I'm trying to help,
and you get so defensive.

18:19.615 --> 18:20.603
Continue serving
then.

18:20.603 --> 18:21.684
Continue serving
then.

18:25.721 --> 18:28.057
Hey, Cece...
No, wai-wai-wait.

18:28.090 --> 18:29.792
They just say
it's no flavor,

18:29.826 --> 18:32.428
but they're willing to let you
try to put some flavor in it.

18:32.462 --> 18:35.598
Like garlic.
No, I just don't want
to put nothing in it.

18:35.631 --> 18:37.767
It's like they're just
spitting in your face,

18:37.800 --> 18:40.269
and, "Oh, it isn't ,
it's not good."

18:40.303 --> 18:41.704
Cece...

18:41.737 --> 18:44.841
I need this reduced down
a little more and add a...

18:44.874 --> 18:46.108
Michael, you know what?

18:46.142 --> 18:47.543
I'm ready to tell everybody
just to leave.

18:47.577 --> 18:48.945
It's coming back
for a reason, right?

18:48.978 --> 18:50.603
Don't even...
Huh?

18:50.603 --> 18:50.880
Don't even...
Huh?

18:50.913 --> 18:52.615
I just don't even
want to hear it right now.

18:52.648 --> 18:54.784
Well, you can't just start
acting like a precious princess.

18:54.817 --> 18:57.320
Yeah, I--I look like
a  princess, right?

18:57.353 --> 18:59.088
Sorry, I thought this
was your restaurant.

18:59.121 --> 19:01.691
I think princess Diana didn't
hang out in a  kitchen.

19:01.724 --> 19:02.725
She's from
your neck of the woods,

19:02.758 --> 19:03.759
isn't she?

19:03.793 --> 19:05.361
Wow.

19:05.394 --> 19:08.231
Exasperated by the number
of returned dishes...

19:08.264 --> 19:09.866
I can't keep doing it.

19:09.899 --> 19:13.169
An immature Cece is ready
to throw in the towel.

19:13.202 --> 19:14.770
I'm done.
What do you mean,
you're done?

19:14.804 --> 19:16.138
Everything's coming back!

19:16.172 --> 19:18.074
Why do I gotta stand here
and keep cooking for nothing?

19:18.107 --> 19:19.342
It's a disaster.

19:19.375 --> 19:20.603
I've had it,
I'm finished, I'm done.

19:20.603 --> 19:21.344
I've had it,
I'm finished, I'm done.

19:39.049 --> 19:40.350
Everything's coming back!

19:40.384 --> 19:42.419
Why do I gotta stand here
and keep cooking for nothing?

19:42.452 --> 19:45.890
Just 90 minutes into
a disastrous dinner service,

19:45.923 --> 19:47.124
Cece is not only frustrated...

19:47.157 --> 19:48.125
I'm done.

19:48.158 --> 19:49.726
She is embarrassed

19:49.760 --> 19:51.528
And has reached
her breaking point.

19:57.301 --> 19:59.303
Are you gonna be all right?
You gonna finish up?

20:00.804 --> 20:02.906
You want oxygen?

20:04.908 --> 20:06.543
Huh?

20:06.577 --> 20:08.946
I reached the breaking point
in the middle of everything.

20:08.979 --> 20:10.714
I just totally
wanted to go home.

20:10.747 --> 20:13.450
Even though Cece
has calmed down

20:13.484 --> 20:14.685
And returned
to the kitchen...

20:16.854 --> 20:19.823
She has no interest
in continuing to cook.

20:19.857 --> 20:20.924
Shut the restaurant down.

20:20.958 --> 20:23.126
What's the point
of having a  chef

20:23.160 --> 20:24.127
Who doesn't want to cook
for them?

20:24.161 --> 20:25.229
Shut it down.

20:25.262 --> 20:26.630
Well, we gotta--
I'll get back there.

20:26.663 --> 20:29.366
It's too important.
It's too important.

20:29.399 --> 20:32.636
As Michael and the line cooks
try to push the last orders out,

20:32.669 --> 20:34.740
Back in the dining room,
many customers are fed up...

20:34.740 --> 20:36.707
Back in the dining room,
many customers are fed up...

20:36.740 --> 20:39.276
And leave without
ever receiving any food.

20:42.646 --> 20:44.314
Have two minutes with you?

20:44.348 --> 20:45.782
Thank you.

20:45.816 --> 20:47.985
You all right?

20:49.353 --> 20:50.821
Now, come on.

20:57.528 --> 21:00.764
I can't start
to even attempt to help

21:00.797 --> 21:03.333
unless you come to terms
with the problem,

21:03.367 --> 21:04.434
and that is the food.

21:04.468 --> 21:04.740
It's good when I cook.

21:04.740 --> 21:05.669
It's good when I cook.

21:05.702 --> 21:07.070
Come on!

21:07.104 --> 21:08.438
This is not a game
for me.

21:08.472 --> 21:10.007
It's not a
game for me!

21:10.040 --> 21:11.508
This is my life!

21:11.542 --> 21:13.677
It's not a joke for me.

21:13.710 --> 21:17.047
Stop staying that.
It's not a joke.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.383
It's not a joke for me.
I care.

21:19.416 --> 21:21.318
If I didn't care,
I wouldn't  be here.

21:21.351 --> 21:23.654
So stop just saying
I don't care.

21:23.687 --> 21:25.589
Just stop, please.

21:25.622 --> 21:26.924
I haven't said that.

21:26.957 --> 21:28.258
Yes, you did.

21:28.292 --> 21:29.593
What I'm trying to tell you

21:29.626 --> 21:32.396
is that you have
to come to terms internally

21:32.429 --> 21:34.740
that there's a huge problem,
and that is with the food.

21:34.740 --> 21:34.865
that there's a huge problem,
and that is with the food.

21:36.366 --> 21:39.236
Nobody wants to hear that
anything that they do sucks.

21:39.269 --> 21:41.471
I don't like to fail.

21:41.505 --> 21:43.774
Death would be
better than failing.

21:43.807 --> 21:45.642
It's certainly
not a sign of weakness

21:45.676 --> 21:48.045
to admit your failings.

21:48.078 --> 21:49.212
I've closed
three restaurants,

21:49.246 --> 21:51.915
but I also have
a number of successful ones,

21:51.949 --> 21:54.318
and 1,650 members--
I know who you are.

21:54.351 --> 21:55.752
And it's--it's--I--

21:55.786 --> 21:57.554
Yeah, a jerk,
you told me earlier.

21:57.588 --> 21:59.189
Well, you can be a jerk!

21:59.222 --> 22:01.058
Stop acting like
a petulant teenager.

22:01.091 --> 22:03.560
I'm not going to stand there
and be a doormat

22:03.594 --> 22:04.740
for you to take
the piss out of me.
But--

22:04.740 --> 22:05.262
for you to take
the piss out of me.
But--

22:05.295 --> 22:06.530
Let's get one thing right.

22:06.563 --> 22:09.399
You asked me here,
and I'm here to help.

22:09.433 --> 22:11.468
So let me in.

22:11.501 --> 22:12.836
Okay, the food sucks.

22:12.869 --> 22:14.671
There, you happy?

22:14.705 --> 22:16.773
There's a problem with
the way the food is prepared.

22:16.807 --> 22:18.375
There's a problem with the way
the food is ordered.

22:18.408 --> 22:20.744
There's a problem with the way
the food's not respected.

22:20.777 --> 22:23.513
I'm sorry, Cece,
but it's just not good enough.

22:35.192 --> 22:37.094
New day tomorrow.
Okay?

22:37.127 --> 22:39.262
What do you want me to do?

22:39.296 --> 22:41.565
I want you to go home
and get some rest.

22:41.598 --> 22:43.467
Right.

22:43.500 --> 22:45.168
We start to rebuild.

22:45.202 --> 22:47.204
I'm sorry
I called you names.

22:47.237 --> 22:48.205
Let's go.

22:48.238 --> 22:49.539
Up.

22:49.573 --> 22:51.108
Let's get in there.

22:51.141 --> 22:52.743
Let them clear down,

22:52.776 --> 22:53.744
and I want you
out of here.

22:53.777 --> 22:55.379
Okay?
Where am I going?

22:55.412 --> 22:56.880
Home.

22:56.913 --> 22:59.650
He says he wants to help me,
and I believe him.

22:59.683 --> 23:02.686
This place means
everything to me.

23:02.719 --> 23:04.621
And I don't want
to just give up.

23:11.762 --> 23:13.196
Chef Ramsay
now believes that Cece

23:13.230 --> 23:14.798
is finally prepared
to listen,

23:14.831 --> 23:17.067
so he comes in early
the next morning

23:17.100 --> 23:20.203
to put the first part
of his plan into action.

23:20.237 --> 23:21.905
Now, all of you together...

23:21.938 --> 23:24.341
No problem.
Cook me the whole menu.

23:24.374 --> 23:26.343
That will be like 180.

23:26.376 --> 23:27.844
181.

23:29.312 --> 23:31.915
All right, we're gonna
give it a try then.

23:31.948 --> 23:33.417
The cooks only
have three hours

23:33.450 --> 23:34.740
to prepare the 181 dishes

23:34.740 --> 23:35.552
to prepare the 181 dishes

23:35.585 --> 23:38.121
before Cece and the rest
of the staff arrive.

23:39.656 --> 23:41.191
Good morning.
Good morning, Chef.

23:41.224 --> 23:42.859
Today's a new day.
Yes?

23:42.893 --> 23:44.828
New start.
New attitude.

23:44.861 --> 23:46.229
I've got a little
surprise for you.

23:46.263 --> 23:48.231
A small surprise.
Let's go.

23:52.569 --> 23:54.204
Oh, my God.

23:54.237 --> 23:55.305
Like, holy.

23:55.338 --> 23:56.707
There's food everywhere.

23:56.740 --> 23:59.209
One of every dish.

23:59.242 --> 24:00.444
Oh, my God.

24:00.477 --> 24:02.045
Oh, my God.

24:02.079 --> 24:04.014
Oh, my God.

24:04.047 --> 24:04.740
I'm shocked at all
the food over here.

24:04.740 --> 24:05.449
I'm shocked at all
the food over here.

24:05.482 --> 24:07.918
Like, I knew the menu
was big,

24:07.951 --> 24:11.021
but seeing it all
in front of me now is amazing.

24:11.054 --> 24:12.989
Like, I'm just like, really?

24:13.023 --> 24:14.558
The menu's far too big.

24:14.591 --> 24:15.792
Yes.
Yes?

24:15.826 --> 24:18.495
That has a huge impact
on a number of things.

24:18.528 --> 24:20.297
Slow production
coming out of the kitchen,

24:20.330 --> 24:22.299
high food costs,
and more importantly,

24:22.332 --> 24:23.967
inconsistency.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.602
The bottom line is,

24:25.635 --> 24:27.003
you're producing

24:27.037 --> 24:29.973
quantity over quality.

24:30.006 --> 24:32.175
So we've seen
the menu visually.

24:32.209 --> 24:34.740
I've got another way
of getting this menu across.

24:34.740 --> 24:35.712
I've got another way
of getting this menu across.

24:35.746 --> 24:39.783
I want to show you
how big your menu really is.

24:41.618 --> 24:43.854
Oh, my God.

24:43.887 --> 24:44.955
Debbie, Ashton,
I need your help.

24:44.988 --> 24:46.857
Yes? Two seconds.
Come around.

24:46.890 --> 24:48.325
I'm gonna start off
with each and every dish.

24:48.358 --> 24:49.793
You're the frozen lady.

24:49.826 --> 24:53.130
Yes? Ashton,
you are the fresh lady.

24:53.163 --> 24:54.931
Let's go.
Calamari fritti.

24:54.965 --> 24:56.700
You have tender squid,
lightly floured and fried.

24:56.733 --> 24:58.268
Fresh or frozen?
Frozen.

24:58.301 --> 25:00.170
Stick it here.
On we go.

25:00.203 --> 25:01.905
Vongole--fresh or frozen?
Frozen.

25:01.938 --> 25:03.073
Can't hear you.
Frozen!

25:03.106 --> 25:04.141
Thank you.
Fresh-grilled salmon.

25:04.174 --> 25:04.740
Fresh or frozen.
Frozen.

25:04.740 --> 25:05.609
Fresh or frozen.
Frozen.

25:05.642 --> 25:06.710
Frozen, frozen.

25:06.743 --> 25:08.345
Frozen.
Frozen.
Frozen, please.

25:08.378 --> 25:10.013
Frozen, let's go.
Frozen.

25:10.046 --> 25:12.048
I've been in the freezer.
Frozen on there.

25:12.082 --> 25:13.450
Frozen.
Definitely frozen.

25:13.483 --> 25:15.452
Keep up, girls.
Struggling to keep up?

25:15.485 --> 25:16.453
Trying.
Trying.

25:16.486 --> 25:17.621
I didn't even think

25:17.654 --> 25:19.523
I was gonna even put
a fresh sticker on that.

25:19.556 --> 25:20.891
I'm going, okay,
I'm gonna stand here,

25:20.924 --> 25:22.859
I guess, the whole day,
just doing nothing.

25:22.893 --> 25:24.561
Caesar salad--
fresh or frozen?

25:24.594 --> 25:26.129
- Fresh.
- Thank  for that.

25:26.163 --> 25:27.197
Fresh salmon
grilled to perfection,

25:27.230 --> 25:28.565
topped with
a citrus-mango salsa.

25:28.598 --> 25:30.400
That's fresh.
Okay, let's go.

25:30.433 --> 25:31.701
It's a rude awakening

25:31.735 --> 25:34.740
to see how much stuff
on the menu is actually frozen.

25:34.740 --> 25:34.938
to see how much stuff
on the menu is actually frozen.

25:34.971 --> 25:37.307
Just over 80% frozen

25:37.340 --> 25:38.942
and 20% fresh.

25:38.975 --> 25:41.711
We're gonna start off
by reducing the menu.

25:41.745 --> 25:43.413
Cece, I'm gonna be working
with you in the kitchen

25:43.446 --> 25:45.649
and coming up with a plan

25:45.682 --> 25:48.652
for the Anna Vincenzo
family-style meal.

25:48.685 --> 25:51.621
Soup, salad, pizza,
homemade lasagna.

25:51.655 --> 25:53.690
I'm gonna do that
with you personally, okay?

25:53.723 --> 25:54.858
Sure.

25:56.826 --> 25:57.928
For the next dinner service,

25:57.961 --> 26:00.030
Chef Ramsay is determined
to introduce

26:00.063 --> 26:02.666
a special that is not only
fresh and delicious,

26:02.699 --> 26:04.668
but positions this restaurant
as the ideal place

26:04.701 --> 26:04.740
to get value and quality
for a family.

26:04.740 --> 26:08.171
to get value and quality
for a family.

26:08.204 --> 26:09.739
Okay, simple lasagna.

26:09.773 --> 26:10.774
The meat lasagna.

26:10.807 --> 26:12.676
Fried beef.

26:12.709 --> 26:14.678
A little touch of the sauce.

26:14.711 --> 26:16.813
Okay, it's gonna be
one third sauce,

26:16.846 --> 26:17.814
one third meat.

26:17.847 --> 26:19.783
A touch of our ricotta.

26:19.816 --> 26:20.917
Sauce on top.

26:20.951 --> 26:24.120
I personally like
this family-style idea,

26:24.154 --> 26:26.056
'cause this is definitely
something that we should do.

26:26.089 --> 26:28.091
'Cause that's gonna
help the kitchen.

26:28.124 --> 26:30.927
It's gonna totally help us
get the food out faster.

26:30.961 --> 26:32.295
Lasagna's in.

26:32.329 --> 26:33.697
Okay, we've got the soup.

26:33.730 --> 26:34.740
Have a little taste.

26:34.740 --> 26:35.098
Have a little taste.

26:35.131 --> 26:37.367
In terms of flavor,
it's extraordinary, yeah?

26:37.400 --> 26:39.169
Yesterday, I really
hated Chef Ramsay

26:39.202 --> 26:40.303
and I wanted to kill him.

26:40.337 --> 26:43.473
Today, I really believe
he wants to help me.

26:45.208 --> 26:46.409
Coming up...

26:46.443 --> 26:48.678
It's , guys.
Do not send it out.

26:48.712 --> 26:51.247
Chef Ramsay raises the bar
at Anna Vincenzo's...

26:51.281 --> 26:53.049
That's establishing
a standard.

26:53.083 --> 26:54.985
But is Cece up
for the challenge?

26:55.018 --> 26:56.519
Whatever.
Just send it out.

26:56.553 --> 26:59.222
Or will she go back
to her old, familiar ways?

26:59.255 --> 27:00.890
- You know what?
- I don't  give a.

27:00.924 --> 27:02.392
It's a relaunch like no other.

27:02.425 --> 27:04.194
If something's ready,
don't wait.

27:04.227 --> 27:04.740
There's a showdown,

27:04.740 --> 27:05.362
There's a showdown,

27:05.395 --> 27:07.464
And this time Cece
may have gone too far.

27:07.497 --> 27:09.366
I'm gonna flip
my  lid.

27:09.399 --> 27:11.701
And none of you have seen me
go  crazy yet!

27:19.197 --> 27:22.267
Chef Ramsay believes Cece is now
willing to take his advice

27:22.300 --> 27:23.401
and move forward.

27:23.401 --> 27:25.136
So he and his team
work together

27:25.169 --> 27:29.039
to pull of a huge surprise
for Cece and her staff.

27:29.073 --> 27:30.040
Good morning.

27:30.074 --> 27:31.475
Morning.

27:31.476 --> 27:32.510
I'd like to welcome you all

27:32.543 --> 27:35.113
to the new Anna Vincenzo's.

27:35.146 --> 27:38.516
Take your blindfolds off,
please.

27:38.549 --> 27:42.120
Welcome to the new
Anna Vincenzo's.

27:42.153 --> 27:43.721
Oh, my God.

27:43.755 --> 27:45.223
It's so bright
and beautiful.

27:45.256 --> 27:45.801
Look at the space created.

27:45.801 --> 27:48.826
Look at the space created.

27:48.860 --> 27:52.196
Gone are those dark,
sedated colors.

27:52.230 --> 27:53.698
We've got lightness.

27:53.731 --> 27:56.100
It's contemporary
and it's timeless.

27:56.134 --> 27:58.703
Doesn't it bring so much light
in here with the windows?

28:00.104 --> 28:02.440
I can't even describe
the difference.

28:02.473 --> 28:06.711
And I think this change
is gonna change everything.

28:09.347 --> 28:12.049
It's classic.
It's contemporary.

28:12.083 --> 28:15.801
You can sit on every table
and view across the room.

28:15.801 --> 28:16.053
You can sit on every table
and view across the room.

28:16.087 --> 28:18.356
Webstaurant stores
have donated

28:18.389 --> 28:21.893
$10,000 worth of plates,
knife, and forks.

28:22.960 --> 28:24.662
Tableware, chairs.

28:24.695 --> 28:25.963
God bless you.

28:25.997 --> 28:27.165
And, Cece,

28:27.198 --> 28:28.366
you, my darling,

28:28.399 --> 28:30.301
are gonna be the star
of your new restaurant.

28:30.334 --> 28:33.337
Have a little look
at that.

28:33.371 --> 28:36.073
"Kiss the cook."
How cool is that?

28:36.107 --> 28:38.843
Make it yours.
Yeah?

28:38.876 --> 28:40.278
The color...

28:40.311 --> 28:43.214
It felt awesome to see
Cece that happy.

28:43.247 --> 28:45.016
Like she was blown away.

28:45.049 --> 28:45.801
She gave him a hug.

28:45.801 --> 28:46.317
She gave him a hug.

28:46.350 --> 28:47.318
Before she wanted
to rip his head off,

28:47.351 --> 28:48.386
and she just
gave him a hug.

28:48.419 --> 28:49.420
It was cool to see.

28:49.454 --> 28:50.488
You happy?

28:50.521 --> 28:51.722
Yes.

28:51.756 --> 28:52.824
Angelo, you happy?

28:55.126 --> 28:56.427
Good.
And what do you think?

29:00.465 --> 29:01.466
Thank you.

29:06.270 --> 29:08.206
God, it's so different.

29:08.239 --> 29:09.674
It looks like
a different place.

29:09.707 --> 29:11.142
I can't get over it!

29:11.175 --> 29:13.144
I'm ecstatic.

29:13.177 --> 29:14.946
I'm just a little nervous
about the new menu.

29:14.979 --> 29:15.801
After this, I don't know
what else he's got in store.

29:15.801 --> 29:17.982
After this, I don't know
what else he's got in store.

29:20.251 --> 29:22.854
The menu has gone down
by half.

29:22.887 --> 29:24.255
It looks better.
Why?

29:24.288 --> 29:26.390
So's you can keep
the cost down

29:26.424 --> 29:28.092
and the freshness up.

29:28.125 --> 29:29.193
Yeah?

29:29.227 --> 29:32.129
You have to think forward.

29:32.163 --> 29:33.931
Your kitchen needs help.

29:33.965 --> 29:34.966
I know.
Yeah?

29:34.999 --> 29:37.468
So I've arranged

29:37.502 --> 29:39.270
for a top
restaurant consultant,

29:39.303 --> 29:41.205
okay, which
I'm taking care of

29:41.239 --> 29:42.707
for the first month,

29:42.740 --> 29:45.801
to help you get through
this difficult time, okay?

29:45.801 --> 29:46.911
to help you get through
this difficult time, okay?

29:46.944 --> 29:48.946
His name is Daniel Serfer.

29:48.980 --> 29:50.715
Daniel.

29:50.748 --> 29:52.149
Hi, Chef.
Yeah, how are you?

29:52.183 --> 29:53.651
I'm doing well, thanks.
Good.

29:53.684 --> 29:55.553
Now, here's
our owner, Cece.

29:55.586 --> 29:57.121
Yes?
Nice to meet you.

29:57.154 --> 29:59.657
He's been
hand-picked by myself.

29:59.690 --> 30:01.225
Years of experience

30:01.259 --> 30:03.561
in some of the best
restaurants across Florida.

30:03.594 --> 30:05.963
Now, this man's gonna be
by your side for the next month.

30:05.997 --> 30:07.231
Yeah?
Look after him.

30:07.265 --> 30:08.232
Listen to him.

30:08.266 --> 30:09.333
I won't yell at him.

30:09.367 --> 30:10.468
Yeah.

30:10.501 --> 30:12.603
You have
a phenomenal chance here

30:12.637 --> 30:13.604
to turn this around.

30:13.638 --> 30:15.673
Today is the start.

30:15.706 --> 30:15.801
Ready? Good.

30:15.801 --> 30:18.109
Ready? Good.

30:18.142 --> 30:19.610
I couldn't even believe

30:19.644 --> 30:21.546
that he got
a chef consultant for us.

30:21.579 --> 30:24.315
I feel more hope now.

30:24.348 --> 30:26.984
I know that this is gonna
make a total difference.

30:33.658 --> 30:35.793
You like the menu,
you like the decor.

30:35.826 --> 30:37.528
Yes.
Good, what's missing?

30:37.562 --> 30:38.829
Customers.

30:38.863 --> 30:39.997
Customers.

30:40.031 --> 30:42.133
So now we have to use
our initiative

30:42.166 --> 30:43.534
and spread the word.

30:43.568 --> 30:45.801
I started putting together
with my team

30:45.801 --> 30:46.304
I started putting together
with my team

30:46.337 --> 30:48.306
the most amazing
marketing plan.

30:48.339 --> 30:52.043
So today,
five Florida radio stations

30:52.076 --> 30:54.078
will be outside
that front door

30:54.111 --> 30:55.479
in your parking lot.

30:55.513 --> 30:56.647
Why?

30:56.681 --> 30:58.349
We are having

30:58.382 --> 31:00.351
the Anna Vincenzo's

31:00.384 --> 31:02.353
Pizza-making Contest.

31:02.386 --> 31:03.988
Oh, my God.

31:04.021 --> 31:06.023
Now, that's not all.

31:06.057 --> 31:09.360
We have three teams
competing in this contest.

31:09.393 --> 31:11.462
Team One, representatives

31:11.495 --> 31:12.863
of the Miami Dolphins.

31:12.897 --> 31:14.599
Yes?

31:14.632 --> 31:15.801
Team Two:

31:15.801 --> 31:16.167
Team Two:

31:16.200 --> 31:17.635
No way.
Representatives

31:17.668 --> 31:19.303
of the Miami Heat.

31:19.337 --> 31:20.671
Oh, my God.

31:20.705 --> 31:23.574
Team Three!

31:23.608 --> 31:25.509
Representatives of

31:25.543 --> 31:27.311
the Florida Panthers.

31:27.345 --> 31:29.280
This is crazy.

31:29.313 --> 31:31.215
The most important
objective of this contest

31:31.248 --> 31:33.050
is, by tonight,

31:33.084 --> 31:35.252
the whole of south Florida,
yeah,

31:35.286 --> 31:37.955
will have heard of Anna
Vincenzo's, yes?

31:37.989 --> 31:39.890
Excited?

31:39.924 --> 31:41.559
Good?

31:41.592 --> 31:43.761
Oh, no.
Why you unhappy now?

31:46.530 --> 31:47.565
Gonna call me a jerk again?

31:47.598 --> 31:49.000
No?

31:49.033 --> 31:50.034
'Cause you haven't today
so far.

31:51.102 --> 31:52.937
It's a jerk-free day?

31:52.970 --> 31:55.139
Wow! Oh, yes!

31:55.172 --> 31:57.108
It's a special day for us.

31:57.141 --> 31:58.542
The whole family
at Anna Vincenzo's,

31:58.542 --> 32:00.077
not just me.

32:08.142 --> 32:09.877
After a drastic makeover...

32:09.911 --> 32:11.446
God, it's so different.

32:11.479 --> 32:13.247
And a dramatic menu change...

32:13.281 --> 32:16.117
The Anna Vincenzo family meal.

32:16.150 --> 32:18.286
Gordon has created
a huge marketing event

32:18.319 --> 32:20.855
to spread the word.

32:20.888 --> 32:23.424
Featuring south Florida's
top pro sports teams.

32:23.458 --> 32:25.259
The Miami Dolphins.

32:25.293 --> 32:27.695
The Miami Heat.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.230
The Florida Panthers.

32:29.263 --> 32:30.298
They will be competing

32:30.331 --> 32:32.600
In the first annual
Anna Vincenzo's

32:32.633 --> 32:34.602
Pizza-making Contest.

32:34.635 --> 32:34.956
The turnout today is amazing.

32:34.956 --> 32:35.870
The turnout today is amazing.

32:35.903 --> 32:37.271
There's camera crews.

32:37.305 --> 32:40.608
There's news crews.
There's radio stations.

32:40.641 --> 32:42.777
I'm like, I don't even
know where to turn.

32:42.810 --> 32:45.346
Each team has the most amazing
ingredients in front of you guys

32:45.379 --> 32:46.948
to make their own pizza.

32:46.981 --> 32:50.451
You have three minutes...
to make that stunning pizza.

32:50.485 --> 32:52.520
Take your stations.

32:52.553 --> 32:53.654
On your marks...

32:53.688 --> 32:54.755
Get set...

32:54.789 --> 32:56.891
Go! Let's go!

32:59.293 --> 33:00.628
Roll and twist!

33:00.661 --> 33:03.064
Slap your baby's butt!

33:03.097 --> 33:04.956
Easy, easy.
Just it flow in your hands.

33:04.956 --> 33:06.234
Easy, easy.
Just it flow in your hands.

33:06.267 --> 33:08.402
You gotta keep it
in a circle.

33:08.436 --> 33:10.638
I'm trying to get it round.
How do you get it round?

33:12.573 --> 33:14.275
10...

33:14.308 --> 33:15.309
9...

33:15.343 --> 33:17.378
8...7...

33:17.411 --> 33:19.280
6...5...

33:19.313 --> 33:20.615
4...3...

33:20.648 --> 33:22.817
2...1!

33:22.850 --> 33:24.986
Now stop!

33:25.019 --> 33:27.488
There we go.
Masterpiece!

33:29.056 --> 33:30.024
Give us a little inspiration

33:30.057 --> 33:31.526
behind the thought
in the process.

33:31.559 --> 33:32.927
We want to make it even.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.956
We wanted to make it a success,
just like the Panthers.

33:34.956 --> 33:35.162
We wanted to make it a success,
just like the Panthers.

33:35.196 --> 33:36.430
Panther pride.

33:36.464 --> 33:38.266
I don't even eat meat,
but I put meat on the pizza.

33:38.299 --> 33:40.568
Just because I didn't know
what else to do, so...

33:40.601 --> 33:41.903
The one ingredient on there

33:41.936 --> 33:43.471
that you think is gonna
blow the mind of the judges.

33:43.504 --> 33:45.573
Put a lot of love in it.
A lotta love?

33:45.606 --> 33:46.741
Okay.

33:46.774 --> 33:47.942
Excellent.
Right!

33:49.110 --> 33:50.611
They all did
a really good job.

33:50.645 --> 33:51.712
Even though it looks
really easy,

33:51.746 --> 33:54.181
it's not that easy
to make pizza.

33:54.215 --> 33:56.050
We're gonna find out
who the winner is.

33:56.083 --> 33:57.618
The Florida Panthers.

34:00.721 --> 34:01.923
Cheesy.

34:01.956 --> 34:02.957
Miami Heat.

34:02.990 --> 34:04.492
Ooh, that one's good.

34:04.525 --> 34:04.956
Here we go.
It's gonna
be tough.

34:04.956 --> 34:06.027
Here we go.
It's gonna
be tough.

34:06.060 --> 34:07.728
The Miami Dolphins.

34:07.762 --> 34:08.863
Beautiful.

34:08.896 --> 34:10.231
Beautiful.
Good-tasting.

34:12.400 --> 34:15.102
The winner
of the first-ever

34:15.136 --> 34:17.471
Anna Vincenzo's
Pizza-making Contest

34:17.505 --> 34:20.207
is gonna be Panthers,
Heat, or Dolphins?

34:20.241 --> 34:21.676
Which one is it?

34:21.709 --> 34:24.378
I have to say them.

34:24.412 --> 34:26.747
The Miami Dolphins.

34:28.015 --> 34:30.251
I'm coming that way.
Pepperoni pizza.

34:30.284 --> 34:31.819
Pepperoni pizza!

34:31.852 --> 34:33.588
Chef Ramsay's
marketing event

34:33.621 --> 34:34.956
did definitely
get the word out

34:34.956 --> 34:35.623
did definitely
get the word out

34:35.656 --> 34:37.692
about the new Anna Vincenzo's
restaurant opening.

34:37.725 --> 34:40.027
The whole Boca knows
that we're doing a relaunch.

34:40.061 --> 34:41.662
It's like a dream.

34:41.696 --> 34:42.830
It's an amazing experience

34:42.863 --> 34:44.465
that I would never
expect in my life.

34:44.498 --> 34:46.167
It's a new beginning.

34:46.200 --> 34:47.401
It's gonna be awesome!

34:52.039 --> 34:54.508
After the extraordinary
marketing event,

34:54.542 --> 34:56.310
Consultant Chef Dan Serfer

34:56.344 --> 34:58.512
works with Cece to prepare
the new menu.

34:58.546 --> 34:59.914
Put these in the oven.

34:59.947 --> 35:02.583
Then Chef Ramsay
introduces the dishes

35:02.617 --> 35:03.684
to the staff.

35:03.718 --> 35:04.956
We cut the menu in half,

35:04.956 --> 35:05.052
We cut the menu in half,

35:05.086 --> 35:06.087
increase the freshness

35:06.120 --> 35:07.655
and the quality.

35:07.688 --> 35:09.457
First impressions--
how does it look?

35:09.490 --> 35:10.458
Smaller.

35:10.491 --> 35:11.726
Smaller, yes.

35:11.759 --> 35:13.127
Okay, let's start
from the top.

35:13.160 --> 35:15.696
Baby fried mozzarella balls
with marinara sauce.

35:15.730 --> 35:17.565
Shrimp scampi, yes?
Calamari fritti.

35:17.598 --> 35:19.567
Not clumped,
glooped together.

35:19.600 --> 35:21.469
Sea mussels, yes, with
white wine and tomato sauce.

35:21.502 --> 35:22.770
Baked clams.

35:22.803 --> 35:23.871
They're not frozen,
they're baked.

35:23.904 --> 35:25.172
It's so beautiful.
Wow.

35:25.206 --> 35:26.941
Parmesan-breaded
pork chop.

35:26.974 --> 35:29.610
The pizzas, they're
a bit of a Hallmark here,

35:29.644 --> 35:30.711
so we just tarted them up
a little bit.

35:30.745 --> 35:32.179
Spaghetti and meatballs,
fresh.

35:32.213 --> 35:33.981
If you're not happy with it,
you don't send it.

35:34.015 --> 35:34.956
End of story.

35:34.956 --> 35:35.182
End of story.

35:35.216 --> 35:38.319
The line stops with you.
Have a taste of the food.

35:38.352 --> 35:39.353
Let's dig in.

35:39.387 --> 35:40.421
Mmm.

35:40.454 --> 35:41.555
The eggplant tastes good.

35:41.589 --> 35:42.823
This is my favorite.

35:42.857 --> 35:44.258
This is my favorite.

35:44.291 --> 35:45.526
I'm very excited
about the menu.

35:45.559 --> 35:46.527
The family meals,

35:46.560 --> 35:47.762
I could do stuff
like we make at home

35:47.795 --> 35:49.764
and serve that family-style.

35:49.797 --> 35:52.566
The Anna Vincenzo
family-style menu.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.502
Push it, okay?
Let's go, eh?

35:54.535 --> 35:56.404
Let's get set up
in the kitchen.

36:01.442 --> 36:02.610
Hi, welcome
to Anna Vincenzo's tonight.

36:02.643 --> 36:04.178
How are you?
Just a party of two?

36:04.211 --> 36:04.956
You want to do
the family special?

36:04.956 --> 36:06.814
You want to do
the family special?

36:06.847 --> 36:08.215
Nice and easy, okay.
You're gonna love it.

36:08.249 --> 36:09.750
I'm very nervous.

36:09.784 --> 36:11.485
Everything's
at stake right now.

36:11.519 --> 36:14.255
We need to get this
relaunch, like, going.

36:15.623 --> 36:17.792
Tonight's about
standards, yeah?

36:17.825 --> 36:20.327
Quality over quantity,
yes?

36:20.361 --> 36:22.697
Anna Vincenzo's
family meal, yeah?

36:22.730 --> 36:24.365
Gotta work tonight.
Let's go.

36:24.398 --> 36:25.599
Give it all you've got.
Yeah?

36:25.633 --> 36:27.034
Yes.
Okay. Please.

36:27.068 --> 36:28.936
I feel really,
really nervous.

36:28.969 --> 36:30.404
Tonight's a really big night.

36:30.438 --> 36:32.006
It means so much to us.

36:32.039 --> 36:33.240
And I just don't want
to mess it up.

36:33.274 --> 36:34.275
Let him know the difference

36:34.308 --> 36:34.956
between what
you're waiting for

36:34.956 --> 36:35.576
between what
you're waiting for

36:35.609 --> 36:36.811
and what's ordering in.

36:36.844 --> 36:38.679
Can you start me

36:38.713 --> 36:41.148
Two veal piccatas
and three whole lasagna.

36:41.182 --> 36:43.617
But don't, like,
don't call it again.

36:43.651 --> 36:45.686
Right, Cece, these first
three or four tables

36:45.720 --> 36:47.021
have got to get out
quickly, yes?

36:47.054 --> 36:49.156
Gordon's overhaul of the menu

36:49.190 --> 36:50.524
has been dramatic,

36:50.558 --> 36:52.660
with an infusion
of quality and freshness.

36:52.693 --> 36:54.161
More salad in there, please.

36:54.195 --> 36:56.497
His family-style meal
and smaller menu

36:56.530 --> 36:57.798
Have made the load
on the kitchen

36:57.832 --> 36:58.866
much more manageable.

36:58.899 --> 37:00.768
Come on, guys,
get it together--timing.

37:00.801 --> 37:02.036
And as a result,

37:02.069 --> 37:04.572
Cece pushes the first orders
out quickly.

37:04.605 --> 37:04.956
Service!

37:04.956 --> 37:06.040
Service!

37:07.274 --> 37:09.376
Okay, very hot plate
there.

37:13.247 --> 37:16.050
It's amazing to see how much fun
everyone's having right now

37:16.083 --> 37:17.485
with this family-style meal.

37:17.518 --> 37:19.019
The atmosphere in here
is magical.

37:19.053 --> 37:20.254
All right, that's good.

37:20.287 --> 37:21.489
I'm glad you guys
are enjoying it.

37:21.522 --> 37:23.624
I need family lasagna,
table ten.

37:23.657 --> 37:25.426
After that,
there's no more.

37:25.459 --> 37:27.328
It's only half an hour
into service

37:27.361 --> 37:29.363
and we've nearly sold out
of the Anna Vincenzo's

37:29.396 --> 37:30.798
family-style meals.

37:30.831 --> 37:32.700
So, as a result, the kitchen's
running a lot smoother.

37:32.733 --> 37:34.956
But the night
is still young.

37:34.956 --> 37:35.336
But the night
is still young.

37:35.369 --> 37:37.738
Those onions are a little
too cooked, I think, no?

37:37.772 --> 37:38.806
No, man.

37:38.839 --> 37:41.842
Whatever.

37:41.876 --> 37:42.943
If something's ready,
don't wait.

37:42.977 --> 37:44.578
Just send it out.

37:44.612 --> 37:45.713
Does that
look good to you?

37:45.746 --> 37:47.047
It doesn't matter.

37:47.081 --> 37:48.415
Get the  out.

37:48.449 --> 37:50.551
That little chop
looks burned from here.

37:50.584 --> 37:52.787
Are you  me?
Is it burnt?

37:52.820 --> 37:54.688
Pork chop?
Yeah.

37:54.722 --> 37:56.123
It's done like that.

37:56.157 --> 37:57.758
Just send it out.
Just send it out.

37:57.792 --> 37:59.627
It looks black from here.

37:59.660 --> 38:01.562
Well, we don't have
time for mistakes.

38:01.595 --> 38:02.830
Service!

38:04.064 --> 38:04.956
It's , guys.

38:04.956 --> 38:07.334
It's , guys.

38:07.368 --> 38:10.271
Is it just plain ignorance,
or are people thick round here?

38:10.304 --> 38:11.705
I'd rather you
go to the table and tell them

38:11.739 --> 38:13.207
it'll be an extra ten minutes
'cause we burnt it

38:13.240 --> 38:14.542
than stand there
sending them.

38:14.575 --> 38:15.976
I'm gonna flip my lid.

38:16.010 --> 38:18.279
And none of you have seen me
go  crazy yet!

38:18.312 --> 38:20.514
- You know what?
- I don't  give a.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.049
hell.

38:32.877 --> 38:34.546
I'd rather
you go to the table

38:34.579 --> 38:35.880
and tell them we burnt it
than stand there

38:35.914 --> 38:37.081
sending them.

38:37.114 --> 38:38.349
It's relaunch night,

38:38.382 --> 38:40.151
And although Cece
has come a long way,

38:40.184 --> 38:41.752
it appears as though
she is slipping back

38:41.786 --> 38:42.887
to her old habits.

38:42.920 --> 38:45.056
It's , guys.

38:45.089 --> 38:47.124
And Gordon is having
none of that.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.125
I know it's hard.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.094
You do not have
to send it out.

38:52.097 --> 38:53.064
Make another one, now!

38:53.098 --> 38:54.065
Thank you!

38:54.099 --> 38:55.233
Start this table.

38:55.267 --> 38:56.801
Eggplant parmesan,

38:56.835 --> 38:59.040
veal parmesan, veal marsala,
spaghetti bolognese.

38:59.040 --> 38:59.104
veal parmesan, veal marsala,
spaghetti bolognese.

38:59.137 --> 39:00.405
No more -ups.
We don't have time.

39:00.438 --> 39:01.973
Thank you.
That's what I need to hear!

39:02.007 --> 39:03.108
We're gonna handle it.

39:03.141 --> 39:05.410
Please keep an eye
on that pork chop.

39:05.443 --> 39:07.412
Don't  burn it,
please.

39:07.445 --> 39:08.647
I was like, you know what?

39:08.680 --> 39:10.515
New place, new rules.

39:10.549 --> 39:12.784
Come on, we're almost there.
We're almost there!

39:12.817 --> 39:15.053
We're gonna start following
what Gordon said.

39:15.086 --> 39:16.621
It's like starting
all over again.

39:16.655 --> 39:17.622
Come on, guys!

39:17.656 --> 39:18.857
Now there's harmony now.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.292
Yeah?

39:20.325 --> 39:23.328
I need the pork chop
before it gets burned again.

39:23.361 --> 39:24.963
Awesome!
Good work!

39:24.996 --> 39:26.398
Good work.

39:26.431 --> 39:28.567
Perfect.
Okay, pork chop.

39:28.600 --> 39:29.040
It's a different Cece

39:29.040 --> 39:29.834
It's a different Cece

39:29.868 --> 39:31.436
than I've ever seen
working in the kitchen.

39:31.469 --> 39:32.704
Now she really cares
what's going on.

39:32.737 --> 39:34.639
She's not gonna
serve crap to a table.

39:34.673 --> 39:36.141
She's gonna make sure
it's good.

39:36.174 --> 39:38.743
That's establishing
a standard, Cece.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.478
That's estab--
not there, but there, yes?

39:40.512 --> 39:41.513
Yes, Chef.

39:46.518 --> 39:49.454
Yeah, that's the way
I like it.

39:49.487 --> 39:51.990
Cece, they said
that pork chop was amazing.

39:52.023 --> 39:53.725
On table 30,
they loved your flounder.

39:53.758 --> 39:54.859
Everything was perfect.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.595
Awesome.

39:56.628 --> 39:59.040
Cece proved she had
accepted Chef Ramsay's plan.

39:59.040 --> 39:59.064
Cece proved she had
accepted Chef Ramsay's plan.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.399
She maintained a high standard
in the kitchen

40:01.433 --> 40:03.935
and she was rewarded
with happy customers.

40:03.969 --> 40:05.770
Everything good, guys?
Yes.

40:05.804 --> 40:07.072
Good.
You enjoying everything?

40:07.105 --> 40:08.073
Good job.
Thank you.

40:08.106 --> 40:09.307
I was just like,

40:09.341 --> 40:11.076
oh, my God,
this feels so good again,

40:11.109 --> 40:13.178
seeing the restaurant full.

40:13.211 --> 40:14.913
This is wonderful!

40:14.946 --> 40:16.481
You know, when you
see the place empty,

40:16.514 --> 40:18.149
it--it hurts.

40:18.183 --> 40:19.651
And when you see it full,

40:19.684 --> 40:21.653
and everybody's like,
"Wow, this is great,"

40:21.686 --> 40:22.988
it's, uh, it's amazing.

40:23.021 --> 40:25.190
I got all my passion back.

40:25.223 --> 40:27.459
Good to see you guys.
I hope to see you again.

40:27.492 --> 40:29.040
Have a good night.
Thank you.

40:29.040 --> 40:29.761
Have a good night.
Thank you.

40:29.794 --> 40:32.063
Thanks for coming.
Come back and see us.

40:34.566 --> 40:37.102
Okay, what a difference...

40:37.135 --> 40:38.603
From the first night
I was here.

40:38.637 --> 40:41.239
This is the restaurant

40:41.272 --> 40:42.307
that Boca Raton

40:42.340 --> 40:43.842
needs and wants.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.276
You did very well tonight.

40:45.310 --> 40:48.179
And even when
problems started,

40:48.213 --> 40:51.683
you didn't start
throwing out mediocre food.

40:51.716 --> 40:53.051
And that
was a telling point.

40:53.084 --> 40:54.486
And that pork chop

40:54.519 --> 40:56.087
that you didn't send

40:56.121 --> 40:57.522
made me happy.

40:57.555 --> 40:58.957
Mediocre doesn't sit

40:58.990 --> 40:59.040
in this town.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.358
in this town.

41:00.392 --> 41:01.493
You're above that now.

41:01.526 --> 41:02.494
Well done.

41:02.527 --> 41:03.595
Thank you.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.463
If you would have
asked me three days ago,

41:05.497 --> 41:07.832
I would have said,
"Oh, good riddance."

41:07.866 --> 41:09.968
I'm sorry to see him go,
actually.

41:10.001 --> 41:11.169
He did a lot.

41:11.202 --> 41:13.304
It's something
I'll never forget.

41:13.338 --> 41:14.939
You've got the restaurant.

41:14.973 --> 41:17.609
You've got the menu.
Yeah?

41:17.642 --> 41:19.177
You've got the family
behind you.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.413
You've got everything
you need, Cece, here

41:21.446 --> 41:23.048
to make this place work.

41:23.081 --> 41:23.982
Go for it.

41:24.015 --> 41:26.117
Yeah?
Stay with it.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.852
'Cause I know you can do it.

41:27.886 --> 41:29.020
Thank you.

41:29.054 --> 41:30.121
Okay?

41:30.155 --> 41:31.222
Can I hug you?

41:31.256 --> 41:32.657
Of course you can.
Come here, you.

41:32.691 --> 41:33.858
- Well done.
- Well done.

41:33.892 --> 41:35.827
Good job.
Really good job.

41:35.860 --> 41:37.862
Yes? And good luck.

41:37.896 --> 41:39.130
I really mean it, okay?

41:39.164 --> 41:40.598
Thank you.
Yeah? Good look.

41:40.632 --> 41:41.733
Thank you.
Okay?

41:41.766 --> 41:43.601
You can do it.
Hey.

41:43.635 --> 41:45.170
Okay.
Good to see you.

41:45.203 --> 41:46.705
Don't be scared to take
that jacket off

41:46.738 --> 41:47.839
from time to time,
yeah?

41:47.872 --> 41:48.940
Loosen up a little bit.

41:48.973 --> 41:50.909
Thank you.
Look after your daughter.

41:50.942 --> 41:53.445
Yes? Trust me.
The money's coming back.

41:53.478 --> 41:54.813
I can smell the dough.

41:57.515 --> 41:58.783
Give me a hug.

41:58.817 --> 41:59.040
Ohh.

41:59.040 --> 42:00.051
Ohh.

42:06.257 --> 42:07.459
Thank you so much.
Take care.

42:07.492 --> 42:08.727
Look after her, yes?
Thank you.

42:08.760 --> 42:09.728
Excellent.
Bye, Chef.

42:09.761 --> 42:10.729
God bless.

42:10.762 --> 42:12.197
Thank you.
Thank you.

42:15.099 --> 42:16.267
Whew, what a week.

42:16.267 --> 42:17.902
Florida may be called
the sunshine state,

42:17.935 --> 42:20.571
but when I first arrived,
it was anything but sunny.

42:20.604 --> 42:22.540
Cece and the restaurant
have come a long way

42:22.573 --> 42:24.141
in just a few days.

42:24.142 --> 42:25.810
Quite frankly,
I'm surprised.

42:25.843 --> 42:28.279
I only hope the sun
continues to shine down

42:28.279 --> 42:29.040
on Anna Vincenzo's.

42:29.040 --> 42:30.180
on Anna Vincenzo's.

42:30.181 --> 42:32.850
Please.

42:32.883 --> 42:35.486
Forecast for tomorrow:

42:35.519 --> 42:38.723
100% chance of tears.

42:38.756 --> 42:40.658
See?
We made friends.

42:40.691 --> 42:42.560
I know you did.

42:44.862 --> 42:46.664
He's not that bad.

42:46.697 --> 42:48.165
I take it back.

42:48.166 --> 42:50.335
He's not a jerk.

42:50.368 --> 42:53.104
After Chef Ramsay
left Anna Vincenzo's,

42:53.137 --> 42:55.473
Cece continued
to follow his advice.

42:55.506 --> 42:56.975
Welcome
to Anna Vincenzo's.

42:57.008 --> 42:58.643
She kept a smaller menu

42:58.676 --> 42:59.040
and buys fresh ingredients.

42:59.040 --> 43:00.511
and buys fresh ingredients.

43:00.511 --> 43:02.980
New and fresh and...
exciting.

43:03.013 --> 43:05.549
And for the first time
in a long time,

43:05.583 --> 43:09.768
Cece is hopeful
for the future.
