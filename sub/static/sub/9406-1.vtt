02:15.235 --> 02:18.541
One video camera...
Beta!

02:31.419 --> 02:33.022
Good evening, my friend.
Welcome.

02:33.121 --> 02:34.556
So nice to see you.

02:34.656 --> 02:37.627
I need money to buy gas,
so I can get out of this place.

02:37.725 --> 02:38.861
Yes, of course.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.332
You will be showing me
what is in the sack?

02:41.430 --> 02:43.367
I can give you a hand.
May I?

02:47.802 --> 02:49.105
Let's iust open up here...

02:54.077 --> 02:56.615
Oh, my, my, my!
What is this horrible thing?

02:56.713 --> 02:59.317
It's a good luck charm.

02:59.417 --> 03:01.955
Yes, I can see
it's working very well.

03:04.923 --> 03:08.162
Whatever you do,
don't touch the medallion.

03:08.259 --> 03:10.129
No, I won't.

03:12.364 --> 03:14.234
I am giving you...

03:14.334 --> 03:17.841
- Ten...
- No!

03:17.938 --> 03:19.307
Twenty dollars.

03:20.941 --> 03:22.109
Goodbye.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.215
Come back soon!

03:36.491 --> 03:39.663
Oh, my!
A face only a mother could love.

04:04.623 --> 04:06.327
What a piece ofiunk!

04:07.859 --> 04:09.763
''0on't touch ''
he says.

04:09.862 --> 04:12.065
Because it might break,
it's so cheap.

04:37.593 --> 04:40.366
Oh, Gupta, by golly!
You're a bloody genius!

04:46.603 --> 04:48.708
You're making
a wonderful deal for _20.

04:49.906 --> 04:51.342
Ahh!

04:56.180 --> 04:59.854
I like Indian food!
So spicy!

05:00.519 --> 05:04.058
- Who are you?
- I'm a leprechaun, me lad,

05:04.156 --> 05:05.993
and you're a greedy thief.

05:06.091 --> 05:09.631
For trying to steal me gold,
I'll be giving you some grief.

05:10.730 --> 05:11.865
Ouch! Ouch!

05:11.964 --> 05:13.400
Have a lie-down, lad?

05:17.337 --> 05:19.074
Nice leather!

05:19.173 --> 05:21.110
I appreciate
a good pair of shoes.

05:22.843 --> 05:25.648
Oh, don't mind if I do!

05:31.886 --> 05:35.425
I think I'll whack you in the head
a dozen times until you're dead.

05:37.259 --> 05:38.795
Take it away!
Take it away!

05:40.029 --> 05:43.971
- You're very afraid of this?
- Stay away, I'm warning you.

05:44.067 --> 05:46.771
I'll tear your eyes out
and I'll rip your face off.

05:46.869 --> 05:48.205
You're a bloody devilish
creature!

05:50.040 --> 05:53.247
You wanted me gold,
and you suffer the consequences.

05:53.344 --> 05:56.683
Now I'll take what's mine,
and be gone from here.

06:06.725 --> 06:10.433
No! You and your gold
belong to Gupta.

06:48.705 --> 06:50.108
Well, you missed us both.

06:50.207 --> 06:52.412
You wanna back up
and try that again?

06:52.510 --> 06:53.678
Sorry.

06:53.778 --> 06:55.515
It's all right,
happens all the time.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.619
0o you know
anything about cars?

06:59.718 --> 07:01.455
'Cause this one
doesn't work.

07:01.554 --> 07:04.126
- Name's Scott.
- Tammy.

07:04.223 --> 07:06.528
Tammy. Great.

07:06.626 --> 07:08.696
What seems
to be the problem?

07:08.795 --> 07:12.569
Obviously, I don't know.
Itjust... died on me.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.503
Well
Iet's take a' look.

07:19.073 --> 07:21.510
Ah, see,
someone stole your engine.

07:25.347 --> 07:27.284
Start it up for me,
if you can.

07:36.860 --> 07:38.096
So what do you think?

07:38.194 --> 07:40.265
Have you ever
blown a rod before?

07:40.364 --> 07:42.433
I beg your pardon?

07:42.532 --> 07:44.904
The engine, I meant.
See, you got your pistons,

07:45.001 --> 07:48.007
and your rods, and...

07:48.105 --> 07:49.741
You don't wanna
know this, right?

07:49.841 --> 07:52.245
No, actually I don't.

07:55.580 --> 07:58.453
I'll give you 1 O bucks
if you give me a ride to work.

07:58.551 --> 07:59.819
Forget it.

07:59.918 --> 08:02.222
You don't have to pay me.
Where do you work?

08:02.320 --> 08:03.790
Chicago.

08:04.923 --> 08:07.228
Huh, yeah, got me.

08:08.896 --> 08:10.099
Chicago.

08:11.098 --> 08:13.702
That's very good.
I would have taken you there, too.

08:21.810 --> 08:22.844
Where is it?

08:24.712 --> 08:26.917
Oh, here it is.
''Legends and Folklore.''

08:44.702 --> 08:47.841
G'day to ya.
The name's O'Reilly,

08:47.940 --> 08:50.578
and I'm here to tell you
about leprechauns.

08:50.676 --> 08:54.717
Legend has it that they were once
magical elves in ancient times...

08:54.813 --> 08:57.418
who became obsessed
with riches and gold.

09:00.887 --> 09:02.724
96...

09:02.823 --> 09:04.526
97...

09:04.624 --> 09:06.361
98...

09:06.459 --> 09:06.893
99...

09:10.297 --> 09:12.735
I'm one shilling short!

09:23.011 --> 09:25.615
Wow! Look at all the lights!

09:25.714 --> 09:27.952
It's unbelievable!

09:28.049 --> 09:30.087
Yeah, it's a quaint little place.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.427
- So where do you work?
- ''The Lucky Shamrock.''

09:34.524 --> 09:36.159
Oh. What's that?

09:36.258 --> 09:38.161
It's a casino, Scott.

09:40.464 --> 09:41.767
What do you do there?

09:44.903 --> 09:47.239
- I'm a magician.
- Right on!

09:47.337 --> 09:51.112
Actually, right now,
I'm just a magician's assistant,

09:51.209 --> 09:55.686
but one of these days,
I'm gonna have my own act.

09:55.782 --> 09:57.351
I believe you.

09:59.451 --> 10:04.395
One-little, two-little,
three little leprechauns.. .

10:04.491 --> 10:06.762
four-little, five.. .

10:08.829 --> 10:11.233
...little, six...

10:11.332 --> 10:13.502
little leprechauns.

10:14.970 --> 10:18.376
This place is unknown,
no one lives here.

10:18.472 --> 10:21.645
Me own savings and loan.
I'll have nothing to fear.

10:26.249 --> 10:28.386
Remember,
his power lies in his gold,

10:28.483 --> 10:31.122
and he'll use all his magic
to protect it.

10:31.220 --> 10:33.390
Yes, try to protect it
from this.

10:39.463 --> 10:41.935
So is this your first trip
to Vegas?

10:42.033 --> 10:45.173
Yeah. I'm iust passing through.
I'm on my way to L.A.

10:45.270 --> 10:48.109
Oh. You gonna be
a movie star?

10:48.206 --> 10:50.209
No, actually,
I'm on my way to school.

10:50.308 --> 10:52.211
My first year of college.

10:52.310 --> 10:55.250
G reat!
It's a smart move.

10:55.347 --> 10:57.785
Go to school.
Learn something worthwhile.

10:57.884 --> 11:01.891
I iust thought I'd swing through
Vegas, see what it's like.

11:01.988 --> 11:05.261
Take my advice
and don't stay long.

11:05.358 --> 11:06.928
Yeah?

11:07.028 --> 11:10.235
Vegas has a way of
Iatching on to a person.

11:10.331 --> 11:13.102
You wanna go,
but you can't.

11:15.236 --> 11:16.706
I'll remember that.

11:19.274 --> 11:22.045
Potatoes are
a leprechaun's favorite meal.

11:22.143 --> 11:24.883
Like all good ol' Irishmen,
he loves his spuds,

11:24.981 --> 11:28.488
but he'll take a bite out of anybody
who threatens to steal his gold.

11:28.585 --> 11:32.759
Woe betide the man who covets
a leprechaun's shillings.

11:32.856 --> 11:35.194
He'll batter and brain them,
he'll mangle..

11:35.291 --> 11:36.494
My, my, my!

11:42.333 --> 11:46.742
Now let us go find
your little brothers and sisters.

11:46.838 --> 11:48.809
ln fact,

11:48.908 --> 11:50.811
let us find the entire family.

11:52.644 --> 11:55.049
If a mortal gets hold
of the leprechaun's gold,

11:55.148 --> 11:58.088
he'll be given one wish for
every shilling in his possession.

11:58.184 --> 12:00.722
He can have anything
he wants in the whole world.

12:37.360 --> 12:40.166
Thanks for the ride.
I really appreciate it.

12:40.264 --> 12:41.634
- Sure.
- Bye.

12:51.744 --> 12:55.017
Hey, I've never been inside
a real casino.

12:55.115 --> 12:57.619
Oh, forget it.
You gotta be 21 .

12:57.717 --> 13:00.189
I know, but I thought
you could sneak me in,

13:00.286 --> 13:02.391
so I can see
what it's like inside.

13:02.489 --> 13:04.526
What do you think,
this is like 0isneyland?

13:04.625 --> 13:06.628
I could lose
my job for that.

13:06.727 --> 13:08.831
My boss
could lose his license.

13:08.930 --> 13:11.669
And you
will lose your shirt.

13:11.766 --> 13:14.739
Right. I didn't think about that.
I'm sorry.

13:17.106 --> 13:18.274
All right, look.

13:18.373 --> 13:22.115
lf I get you into the den of iniquity,
you gotta promise me something.

13:22.212 --> 13:23.347
No gambling.

13:23.446 --> 13:25.651
- Okay.
- Just take a look around,

13:25.749 --> 13:27.953
see what you gotta see,
and beat it.

13:28.051 --> 13:29.721
- I'm out of there.
- All right.

13:30.854 --> 13:32.892
So who do you work for,
magician-wise?

13:32.991 --> 13:35.596
Right now, I'm assisting
The Great Fazio.

13:35.693 --> 13:38.932
- What's a Fazio?
- Well, Scott,

13:39.030 --> 13:42.003
a Fazio is a mediocre magician
who couldn't pull a rabbit

13:42.101 --> 13:43.571
out of a pet store.

13:43.669 --> 13:45.906
But it pays the bills.

13:46.006 --> 13:48.209
Remember now,
no trouble, okay?

13:48.306 --> 13:49.575
ln and out.

13:49.675 --> 13:51.211
Okay.

13:51.310 --> 13:53.013
Maybe I could come
see your show,

13:53.113 --> 13:56.053
and we could have dinner
afterwards.

13:57.785 --> 14:00.456
It's a possibility,
if I'm not busy...

14:00.553 --> 14:01.889
who knows?

14:02.657 --> 14:03.825
ln you go.

14:55.248 --> 14:56.951
You are mine,
you little bugger.

15:04.158 --> 15:05.327
Ahhh!

15:07.428 --> 15:08.496
Ha, ha, ha!

15:11.766 --> 15:13.837
you missed me!
you missed me!

15:13.936 --> 15:16.107
lf you're gonna linger,
I'll give you the finger.

15:18.875 --> 15:20.345
Ahh!

15:32.524 --> 15:33.992
Ahhh!

15:44.436 --> 15:47.208
Stay away from me,
you steaming pile of cannibal dung!

15:49.209 --> 15:51.079
I'm a dangerous man!

15:53.646 --> 15:54.748
Stay away from me!

15:57.985 --> 16:00.725
I remember when
Paddy McGinty got sick with...

16:07.396 --> 16:09.433
I want me shilling!

16:52.012 --> 16:53.615
Oh, yes, yes!

16:57.318 --> 16:58.587
All right.

16:58.686 --> 17:00.556
Oh!

17:00.654 --> 17:01.689
Thank you, Marissa.

17:06.595 --> 17:08.064
You're terrible.

17:08.762 --> 17:09.965
Seyen!

17:11.834 --> 17:14.673
- Whoo!
- All right!

17:14.770 --> 17:17.008
Roll again, Father Bob!

17:17.107 --> 17:20.981
Give me those dice here.
More money, come on.

17:22.179 --> 17:23.448
Ready?

17:24.415 --> 17:25.885
Here she goes.
Look at this!

17:26.885 --> 17:28.887
All right.

17:33.125 --> 17:35.529
What time is it?

17:35.628 --> 17:37.798
OO.
Where's Tammy?

17:37.897 --> 17:39.967
I don't know, damn it!
She's got work to do!

17:40.065 --> 17:42.804
Why do you keep her around?
She's not worth a damn.

17:42.902 --> 17:45.775
She's got a way
of filling out a costume.

17:45.872 --> 17:48.410
I could look
just as good, you know.

17:48.509 --> 17:50.311
Why don't you hire me?

17:50.410 --> 17:53.650
20 years ago, Loretta,
or should I say 20 Ibs. ago?

17:55.016 --> 17:58.156
I'm not always gonna look
just like this, pally.

17:58.253 --> 18:00.122
No? You found
the fountain of youth?

18:00.221 --> 18:02.459
I've been saving my pennies,
buddy boy,

18:02.558 --> 18:05.130
and one of these days,
I'll come waltzing in that door...

18:05.227 --> 18:07.599
with everything packed
into all the right places.

18:07.696 --> 18:10.033
You need more
than a boob job, Loretta.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.570
You need
a personality transplant.

18:12.668 --> 18:14.138
Bitch!

18:14.237 --> 18:16.575
Oh, I'm sorry
I'm late, Fazio.

18:16.673 --> 18:19.145
I told you, you will
address me as ''Great One.''

18:19.243 --> 18:20.812
Off stage and on.

18:20.910 --> 18:23.048
You're a magician,
not the Pope.

18:23.147 --> 18:25.886
I am your teacher.
You will show me respect.

18:25.984 --> 18:27.319
Right.

18:28.588 --> 18:29.823
Loretta.

18:29.921 --> 18:31.256
Mm-hmm.

18:31.356 --> 18:32.559
Throw me that lighter.

18:35.127 --> 18:36.062
Ow!

18:36.162 --> 18:37.732
Are you doing
the magic rings tonight?

18:37.830 --> 18:39.065
Screw the magic rings!

18:41.101 --> 18:42.435
Oh, my God!

18:42.536 --> 18:45.041
I've got something
1 O times better.

18:45.138 --> 18:48.478
You're in the box,
I do the standard switch gag,

18:48.576 --> 18:51.381
and then I set fire
to the box!

18:51.479 --> 18:53.916
The audience goes nuts,
thinking you're in there...

18:54.015 --> 18:56.185
being burnt alive.

18:56.284 --> 18:59.090
I'm gonna call it
''The Burning Beauty.''

19:03.492 --> 19:04.727
Oh, God!

19:09.032 --> 19:11.771
What the hell
is going on here?

19:11.868 --> 19:15.775
Fazio, is this the fabulous stunt
you wanted me to see?

19:15.872 --> 19:17.508
What are you, nuts?

19:17.608 --> 19:19.879
Only a moron would
try something like this.

19:19.977 --> 19:20.978
You believe this guy?

19:21.078 --> 19:23.215
It'll be great. I'll make sure
she's got protection.

19:23.314 --> 19:24.884
Forget it.
End of discussion.

19:24.982 --> 19:28.022
I'm not taking any chances
with my future headliner.

19:28.120 --> 19:29.957
How you're doing, babe?
You look sensational.

19:30.055 --> 19:31.191
Now, you...

19:31.290 --> 19:34.328
get out there and mix with
the suckers. 0o something like...

19:34.426 --> 19:38.067
do some card tricks or something.
Keep them entertained.

19:38.164 --> 19:40.669
Out of the question!
I work the main room!

19:40.767 --> 19:42.738
- I'm a star.
- You're a schmuck.

19:42.836 --> 19:45.574
Now get out there
and earn your pay, Fazio.

19:48.942 --> 19:51.080
That goes for you, too.
Break is over.

19:51.179 --> 19:52.715
Back to work.

19:59.721 --> 20:03.563
So, you need anything,
you know who to come to, right?

20:03.660 --> 20:04.595
Right.

20:04.695 --> 20:07.066
Yeah, you keep playing
hard to get,

20:07.163 --> 20:09.434
but mark my words,
you'll come around.

20:09.533 --> 20:10.936
I guarantee.

20:13.904 --> 20:15.474
I saw that.

20:21.145 --> 20:22.815
Rolling, rolling, rolling!

20:22.914 --> 20:24.852
Where she stops,
nobody knows.

20:26.484 --> 20:28.322
And winner,
wi n ner, wi n ner!

20:28.420 --> 20:31.225
We haye a winner!

20:31.323 --> 20:33.428
To the sharp-dressed man!

20:33.526 --> 20:34.561
Thank you.

20:35.663 --> 20:38.834
You'll need a dump truck
to take it all home, Mister.

20:38.932 --> 20:40.534
A rack for you.

20:43.971 --> 20:46.008
Yeah, this is for you.

20:46.107 --> 20:49.647
What a gentleman! Uh-huh!

20:49.745 --> 20:51.949
Everyone's a winner today.

21:25.917 --> 21:28.690
Excuse me, do you know
where I can cash a check?

21:28.789 --> 21:30.892
Are you old enough
to be in here?

21:30.990 --> 21:33.962
Uh--oh! Yes!
You're old enough.

21:34.059 --> 21:36.899
Right over there.
You have a good day.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.103
Hey, Mitch,
how's it hanging?

21:42.202 --> 21:44.975
Hi, fellas!
Listen, not now, okay?

21:45.072 --> 21:46.809
I've got business.

21:46.908 --> 21:49.045
Stay here!

21:49.144 --> 21:50.712
What are you, a 44 regular?

21:50.813 --> 21:54.019
You know, I've got a plaid that'll
make you look 20 Ibs. younger.

21:54.116 --> 21:55.284
What do you want, Art?

21:55.384 --> 21:58.056
What do I want?
I want brown hair.

21:58.153 --> 22:00.725
I want health insurance
for all Americans.

22:00.824 --> 22:02.928
I want the Mets to get
their shit together.

22:03.025 --> 22:05.965
Let's not worry about what I want,
but about what I need.

22:06.062 --> 22:08.267
- I need my money.
- Tomorrow. Tomorrow's good.

22:08.365 --> 22:10.737
I'll stop by your store,
we'll take care of everything.

22:10.836 --> 22:12.137
- Tell him.
- Okay? Excuse me.

22:12.236 --> 22:15.008
Look sharp, be sharp.

22:18.009 --> 22:20.079
No, tell him the other thing,
the threat thing.

22:20.178 --> 22:21.680
Oh...

22:21.780 --> 22:24.920
You pay Arthur the money
you owe him,

22:25.016 --> 22:26.919
or I will kill you.

22:27.018 --> 22:28.054
That's good.

22:28.154 --> 22:31.126
What are you, tough guys?
I got hemorrhoids tougher than you.

22:31.225 --> 22:32.459
Hey!

22:32.558 --> 22:35.263
On the other hand, why don't
we meet a little later...

22:35.362 --> 22:37.299
over by the cashier's cage?

22:37.397 --> 22:40.403
OO?
It's good for me if it's good for you.

22:40.501 --> 22:42.437
OO? When do you take
your break?

22:42.536 --> 22:45.910
- 9:30.
- 9:30 to 9:45? Can you make it?

22:46.006 --> 22:47.542
- Sure.
- OO is good.

22:47.642 --> 22:49.245
- You mind?
- Yeah.

22:51.914 --> 22:54.017
You buy off the rack,
that's what happens.

22:56.887 --> 22:58.991
I could've taken him.

22:59.088 --> 23:01.493
No, no, he couldn't.
You, bigger.

23:11.870 --> 23:15.176
Get 'em down,
before the wheel goes 'round.

23:15.273 --> 23:17.911
We're gonna have somebody lucky
before the night is over.

23:18.009 --> 23:21.015
You feelin' lucky?
You feelin' lucky, sugar?

23:21.113 --> 23:23.116
What you gonna do
with all that, huh?

23:24.950 --> 23:27.355
I believe I'll try this one.

23:27.453 --> 23:29.825
0angerous man, I like it.

23:32.258 --> 23:35.865
And the wheel goes round and round,
no more bets, no more bets.

24:00.289 --> 24:01.325
Ah!

24:02.793 --> 24:07.669
There was an old man of Madras
whose balls were made of fine brass,

24:07.764 --> 24:10.971
so, in stormy weather,
they both clanged together,

24:11.068 --> 24:13.006
and sparks flew
out of his ass.

24:16.040 --> 24:19.146
I'm finding this to be a very funny
and poetic leprechaun.

24:19.243 --> 24:21.949
I'm glad you liked it, lad.

24:22.047 --> 24:25.954
Now you left the door open,
so I assumed you wanted to see me.

24:26.052 --> 24:29.023
Yes, I'm wanting
to discuss things with you.

24:29.121 --> 24:33.029
- For instance?
- I want to negotiate.

24:33.126 --> 24:35.397
I am for giving you
this medallion,

24:35.496 --> 24:38.501
which you are terribly,
terribly afraid of,

24:38.599 --> 24:40.169
for half your gold.

24:40.267 --> 24:42.505
Half me gold
for a worthless medallion?!

24:42.604 --> 24:45.242
This is my final offer!
You are taking it or leaving it.

24:47.409 --> 24:50.114
You got a deal, lad.

24:50.212 --> 24:52.349
Now, put it away,
why don't you?

24:59.722 --> 25:01.726
Perhaps I'll do
a little fishing.

25:14.606 --> 25:17.713
I told you a terrible lie,
and now you're going to die.

25:21.547 --> 25:23.550
18 red.
We got a winner!

25:23.649 --> 25:26.689
I can't...
I can't belieye it!

25:26.787 --> 25:28.724
How could this happen to me?

25:28.823 --> 25:31.227
Place your bets, place your bets.
Tough luck, kid.

25:31.324 --> 25:33.996
So, you gonna bet or what?
Get 'em down.

25:34.094 --> 25:35.530
You want me to bet?

25:35.630 --> 25:38.102
I had _23,OOO.

25:38.199 --> 25:40.304
So? Looks like you got
a couple hundred.

25:40.402 --> 25:41.903
You can get hot.

25:42.004 --> 25:45.243
Get 'em down, get 'em down.
Big spender, big spender.

25:45.340 --> 25:48.613
And the wheel goes round
and round and round, get 'em down.

25:50.747 --> 25:51.848
There you go.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.720
- Where the hell were you?
- I told you,

27:25.818 --> 27:28.089
the trap door
keeps getting stuck.

27:28.189 --> 27:31.529
That's what I get for working at
a dump like this, nothing works.

27:34.062 --> 27:36.699
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

27:44.373 --> 27:46.043
No more bets, no more bets!

27:46.143 --> 27:49.349
Feelin' lucky,
Mr. Big Time Spender?

27:49.445 --> 27:51.282
Here she's dropping...

27:51.380 --> 27:53.150
Oh! Green, double zero!

27:53.250 --> 27:55.220
The house makes out.
Sorry, folks!

27:57.353 --> 28:01.462
What have I done?
I'm ruined, I'm finished.

28:01.559 --> 28:04.999
What, are you kidding me?
You're due, you're gonna make it big.

28:05.097 --> 28:07.201
- Place your bets!
- What?!

28:07.299 --> 28:08.333
Trust me.

28:08.433 --> 28:11.238
Bad streak of luck like that,
no way you're gonna lose.

28:11.336 --> 28:13.607
Get 'em down
before the wheel goes around!

28:13.706 --> 28:15.342
Oh, yeah, trust me.

28:15.441 --> 28:17.044
But I don't have
any more money.

28:17.143 --> 28:19.380
Nice watch there.
Could bring a nice chunk o'change.

28:20.847 --> 28:24.054
My grandpa gave me this watch,
for graduation.

28:24.986 --> 28:27.524
Make him proud.
Make a comeback. Win!

28:30.357 --> 28:32.762
Pawn shop across the street,
tell 'em Loretta sent you.

28:32.860 --> 28:34.363
Get 'em down, get 'em down!

28:36.698 --> 28:37.800
- Ha!
- Ow!

28:39.735 --> 28:41.638
Where's me shilling?

28:41.737 --> 28:43.140
I want me shilling!

28:43.239 --> 28:43.974
Help!

29:08.634 --> 29:10.904
No! No! No!

29:11.003 --> 29:14.075
Tell me where it is,
or by me sainted mother,

29:14.174 --> 29:15.509
I'll strangle you!

29:20.347 --> 29:21.849
This must be the place.

29:25.686 --> 29:28.426
This is your last chance.
I'm warning you.

29:28.523 --> 29:30.326
I want me shilling!

29:40.904 --> 29:43.775
Oh, no!
What was I thinking?

29:43.872 --> 29:46.411
With all this killing,
I've lost me shilling!

29:48.545 --> 29:49.513
Hello!

29:51.615 --> 29:53.184
Anybody here?

30:01.059 --> 30:02.562
Hello?

30:05.731 --> 30:07.101
Oh, my God!

30:16.442 --> 30:17.744
Oh, man!

30:19.113 --> 30:21.016
I thought I had problems.

30:25.786 --> 30:28.526
Operator, listen,
I'm in a pawn shop

30:28.623 --> 30:32.163
across the street from
the Lucky Shamrock Casino.

30:32.261 --> 30:34.263
And I found a dead person.

30:34.363 --> 30:35.565
Yeah, I'm sure.

30:36.165 --> 30:38.670
Yeah.

30:38.768 --> 30:40.271
All right,
I'll wait right here.

30:44.040 --> 30:46.077
A leprechaun
is very territorial.

30:46.176 --> 30:49.383
He can never tolerate another
Ieprechaun crossing his boundaries.

30:52.583 --> 30:54.520
One leprechaun
can be aggravating,

30:54.619 --> 30:57.624
but two can be devastating.

30:57.722 --> 30:59.258
With that in mind,

30:59.358 --> 31:02.163
let's review what we've learned
about leprechauns.

31:02.261 --> 31:05.701
Number one,
his power lies in his gold.

31:05.798 --> 31:08.870
Without it, he's iust another gnome
full of mischief.

31:10.103 --> 31:12.441
Number two,
each of his gold shillings

31:12.539 --> 31:16.279
will bring a wish come true
to anyone who possesses them.

31:17.644 --> 31:18.980
A wish, huh?

31:19.612 --> 31:22.518
I wish I was back at the casino
on a winning streak.

31:25.520 --> 31:26.521
Aargh!

31:27.788 --> 31:30.461
I've lost him!

31:30.559 --> 31:32.529
He's got me shilling!

31:32.627 --> 31:34.297
He's got me shilling!

31:36.966 --> 31:38.535
What the heck
am I doing here?

31:38.633 --> 31:41.239
There are no other bets,
no other bettors.

31:41.338 --> 31:43.408
Just the house
and the golden boy!

31:47.245 --> 31:50.384
He's riding seven red,
Iet's see how lucky he gets.

31:58.289 --> 31:59.925
Oh, hell!
The seven red!

32:00.024 --> 32:01.193
We got a winner!

32:07.634 --> 32:09.336
You gonna let that ride,
golden boy?

32:27.189 --> 32:33.067
And the luckiest man in Las Vegas
puts the whole load on 1 3 black.

32:33.161 --> 32:36.536
13 black is up,
nobody else is betting.

32:41.204 --> 32:45.546
Ah! Lovely golden palaces
completely full of riches,

32:45.643 --> 32:49.317
I'll rip them off and rob them blind,
those dirty sons of bitches!

32:58.057 --> 33:01.329
- Yeah!
- Oh, oh, oh! Black 1 3!

33:01.427 --> 33:03.697
Another winner,
another wi n ner!

33:03.796 --> 33:06.033
This guy's got
a hell of a winning streak.

33:07.868 --> 33:10.172
Winning streak.
I wished for a winning streak!

33:13.941 --> 33:15.978
What the hell is going on here?

33:16.076 --> 33:17.446
Unbelievable! He can't lose!

33:17.545 --> 33:20.451
Two hours ago, he's losing his shirt.
Now, I can't stop him.

33:20.549 --> 33:22.518
You better stop him,
or else.

33:23.785 --> 33:25.588
Any other bettors?
No other bettors!

33:27.456 --> 33:29.828
On the way to being
a millionaire.

33:29.925 --> 33:31.662
Six black.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.028
Here we go!

33:37.334 --> 33:39.171
Come on, baby,
make me a wi n ner!

33:43.139 --> 33:44.642
And it's a...

33:48.746 --> 33:52.521
Whoa!
The hits just keep on coming!

33:52.619 --> 33:54.421
A winner!

33:54.519 --> 33:57.157
I've about had it with you,
Loretta.

33:57.255 --> 33:58.725
I did what you told me.

33:58.824 --> 33:59.960
Something went wrong.

34:00.059 --> 34:03.733
You better get the money back
or something will go wrong.

34:03.830 --> 34:05.767
With you.
You know what I mean?

34:05.865 --> 34:07.267
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

34:35.364 --> 34:38.103
Golden Nugget.
I'd like one of those.

34:39.503 --> 34:41.106
Loretta; He's a winner again!

34:43.541 --> 34:46.246
Ladies and gentlemen,

34:46.344 --> 34:48.982
due to a slight quivering
in the stem of the wheel,

34:49.080 --> 34:50.315
the situation is thus--

34:50.416 --> 34:53.355
this table is closed,
but it's only temporary.

34:53.452 --> 34:55.022
Come back
in a little while.

34:55.120 --> 34:56.089
- Aw!
- All right?

34:56.188 --> 34:57.758
Thank you very much.

35:01.461 --> 35:03.398
Hey, kid...

35:03.497 --> 35:04.665
congratulations.

35:04.764 --> 35:06.968
You've had some--
some amazing streak of luck.

35:07.067 --> 35:09.472
- I mean, truly amazing.
- Thanks!

35:09.570 --> 35:12.275
I don't know how it happened.
I was losing everything...

35:12.373 --> 35:13.542
and all of a sudden...

35:13.642 --> 35:16.414
Yeah, you see, that's how
it happens sometimes.

35:16.511 --> 35:19.884
Tell me, kid, you--
you staying here at the hotel?

35:19.980 --> 35:21.216
No, actually I'm not.

35:21.316 --> 35:23.788
Oh, well
Iet's just chang'e that.

35:23.885 --> 35:25.288
Here you go.

35:25.388 --> 35:28.794
We'd like you to be our guest.
Anything you want, it's on me.

35:28.890 --> 35:30.460
- Okay?
- Wow!

35:30.560 --> 35:31.696
Thanks a lot!

35:31.794 --> 35:34.901
Oh, no problem.
Listen, why don't you just relax,

35:34.998 --> 35:37.636
take a break,
come back in a hour or so,

35:37.736 --> 35:40.140
and see if you can keep
that winning streak going?

35:40.237 --> 35:41.974
- What do you say, kid, huh?
- Yeah!

35:42.072 --> 35:43.976
I can't wait
to get back into it.

35:44.075 --> 35:47.047
Las Vegas is really
turning out to be a great place.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.817
Vegas, the greatest
little town in the world!

35:49.914 --> 35:51.450
I'll see you in a while.

35:51.550 --> 35:54.289
Oh, we'll keep the same
table reserved just for you.

35:54.386 --> 35:55.856
Okay, I'll be here.

35:55.955 --> 35:57.123
That's good.

35:57.591 --> 35:59.027
Jesus!

35:59.126 --> 36:00.293
Schmuck!

36:01.661 --> 36:03.731
Tammy, you won't believe
what happened!

36:03.830 --> 36:07.404
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be gambling!

36:07.502 --> 36:10.139
- I won!
- All that?

36:10.237 --> 36:12.542
Scott, you said
you wouldn't gamble!

36:12.640 --> 36:14.410
I know,
but something happened to me,

36:14.510 --> 36:16.347
it's like I've got
the fever or something.

36:16.445 --> 36:20.052
I mean, I was losing my shirt,
and then I went to pawn my watch,

36:20.149 --> 36:21.885
and then
I found a dead guy...

36:21.984 --> 36:23.119
You what?!

36:23.218 --> 36:25.756
At the pawn shop,
but the next thing you know,

36:25.854 --> 36:28.092
I'm back at the casino
winning everything.

36:28.191 --> 36:29.427
Listen to me...

36:29.527 --> 36:31.964
They gave me my own room!
On the house, see?

36:32.061 --> 36:34.165
Scott, iust shut up
and listen to me.

36:34.264 --> 36:36.903
I want you to cash in your chips
and go home.

36:37.001 --> 36:39.439
Get in your car
and leave Las Vegas.

36:39.538 --> 36:41.808
No, Tammy, no, listen.

36:41.906 --> 36:44.845
All this happened
because of you.

36:44.942 --> 36:46.780
I wanna share it
with you.

36:46.878 --> 36:49.516
Scott!
Oh, my God!

36:49.615 --> 36:51.318
Are you serious?

36:53.786 --> 36:55.756
Look, I've got a show,
I gotta go.

36:55.855 --> 36:57.658
Just...
all right, cash in the chips

36:57.758 --> 36:59.695
and go to your room
and stay there.

36:59.793 --> 37:03.734
0on't let anybody in!
I cannot stress that enough.

37:03.831 --> 37:05.501
Nobody comes in.

37:05.599 --> 37:07.737
And keep the money
right beside you.

37:07.836 --> 37:09.639
- Okay?
- Okay.

37:09.737 --> 37:12.843
When I'm done with my next show,
I'll come up and we'll talk.

37:12.940 --> 37:14.343
- Okay?
- All right.

37:14.442 --> 37:16.345
I'll be up
as soon as I can.

37:18.547 --> 37:20.017
This is so great,
I can't...

37:20.115 --> 37:21.283
Shh!
Scott!

37:21.384 --> 37:22.419
Shh!

37:25.522 --> 37:26.891
Are you gonna
cash those in?

37:26.989 --> 37:28.425
Oh, yeah.

37:28.525 --> 37:30.295
You've done
well for yourself.

37:30.393 --> 37:31.729
lt was a good night.

37:41.773 --> 37:42.774
Nope!

37:47.546 --> 37:48.916
Me shilling!

37:50.783 --> 37:52.153
A lucky sign.

37:52.252 --> 37:54.623
The gold inside
will soon be mine.

38:11.406 --> 38:13.376
Fine suit of clothes, lad!

38:13.476 --> 38:15.079
Well, thank you,
thank you very much.

38:15.177 --> 38:17.213
Those shoes...
do they come in blue suede?

38:17.312 --> 38:19.417
I really like 'em, man.

38:19.515 --> 38:21.652
Well, thank you,
thank you very much.

38:21.752 --> 38:23.489
Hey, man,
you do that pretty good.

38:23.587 --> 38:26.358
Next time, make sure
you get paid for it.

38:26.455 --> 38:28.493
Hey, man,
see you on the flipside.

38:33.865 --> 38:36.303
Vegas!
My kind o' town!

38:45.144 --> 38:47.314
Thank you.
No, thank you.

38:47.413 --> 38:50.152
And now,
using all my magic,

38:50.249 --> 38:53.422
I will summon forth
a member of the animal kingdom.

38:56.891 --> 38:57.725
Bah!

39:04.766 --> 39:06.001
fazio!

39:10.137 --> 39:13.143
Of course, the casino won't
allow me to use a real bunny.

39:14.544 --> 39:15.712
Oh, my God!

39:19.682 --> 39:21.285
Hello, little one.

39:21.384 --> 39:23.221
What an interesting costume.

39:23.319 --> 39:24.755
Watch this...

39:30.059 --> 39:31.195
Oh, shit!

39:32.897 --> 39:34.500
A little token of my esteem,

39:34.599 --> 39:36.469
it is exactly what it seems.

39:36.568 --> 39:39.473
Made fresh daily
OO

39:39.571 --> 39:42.844
lt comes from my shillelagh,
you can keep it in a crock.

39:59.962 --> 40:01.798
Fazio!
J ust the girl I wanna see.

40:01.896 --> 40:03.566
Not now!
Some little butthead...

40:03.664 --> 40:05.367
What is that smell?
Is that my shoe?

40:05.466 --> 40:07.971
- It was in my hand!
- Oh, my God!

40:08.069 --> 40:10.641
Have you seen that
little tramp that works for me?

40:10.740 --> 40:13.611
Oh, Tammy? Forget her.
Focus on that punk at the elevator.

40:15.745 --> 40:17.214
What about him?

40:17.313 --> 40:20.052
He iust won over a hundred
thou with the roulette wheel.

40:20.150 --> 40:22.721
You're kidding! How did you
Iet him win that much?

40:22.819 --> 40:25.124
Something went wrong.
He still got it on him.

40:25.221 --> 40:26.156
Cash and carry.

40:28.092 --> 40:30.897
- In cash?
- He's got this gold coin I want.

40:30.996 --> 40:31.996
Really?

40:32.095 --> 40:33.531
I figured we split
the green,

40:33.631 --> 40:35.902
I get the gold coin.
You know, good luck charm.

40:38.437 --> 40:40.408
What's his room number?

40:51.318 --> 40:52.788
Room service?

41:00.428 --> 41:02.800
Like taking candy from a baby!

41:04.899 --> 41:07.471
- Go and throw me a winner!
- Yeah!

41:09.905 --> 41:11.041
Yeah!

41:13.076 --> 41:16.215
- Oh, I never lose!
- Hey, Tony, look what we got here.

41:16.312 --> 41:17.414
- A high roller.
- Move!

41:17.513 --> 41:20.753
Nice duds.
What is that, lederhosen?

41:20.851 --> 41:22.487
- Take a break, pal.
- Hey, crappier,

41:22.587 --> 41:24.556
you give me them dice,
I'm feeling lucky!

41:25.589 --> 41:27.760
But I'm not through
winning, lad!

41:27.859 --> 41:29.964
Get outta here...

41:30.062 --> 41:31.665
Aaargh!

41:35.333 --> 41:37.036
Looks like a slot machine!

41:38.871 --> 41:40.809
You wanna try your luck?

41:43.676 --> 41:46.414
This is my kind of place,
crooked and sleazy,

41:46.513 --> 41:49.085
stealing gold from humans
is awfully easy.

41:50.283 --> 41:53.723
Look out, Vegas!
I'm taking over!

41:56.924 --> 42:00.064
Money, money,
money, money...

42:00.162 --> 42:01.765
Oh, it's good!

42:01.863 --> 42:04.168
Money is good!

42:04.266 --> 42:05.535
Money...

42:27.026 --> 42:28.728
That's silk.
I'll keep that.

42:52.920 --> 42:53.454
Hey!

42:54.522 --> 42:56.225
What are you doing
in my room?

42:58.493 --> 42:59.493
Oof!

43:06.202 --> 43:07.103
Ow!

43:16.780 --> 43:18.216
Room seryice!

43:20.651 --> 43:22.053
What the hell...?

43:22.152 --> 43:24.090
Now, me boyo,

43:24.189 --> 43:26.092
I smell me shilling.

43:26.191 --> 43:28.829
Tell me where it is
or there'll be another killing.

43:28.928 --> 43:30.730
What the hell are you?!

43:30.829 --> 43:33.634
I'm a leprechaun,
come to claim me gold.

43:35.433 --> 43:36.369
Aah!

43:44.211 --> 43:45.346
Aaah!

43:50.218 --> 43:52.221
Aaah!

43:55.390 --> 43:57.393
God!

44:02.231 --> 44:04.134
Yeah, give me hotel security.

44:05.367 --> 44:09.141
Yeah, I'd like to report
a leprechaun in your hotel.

44:09.239 --> 44:11.344
No, a leprechaun.

44:11.441 --> 44:13.310
Yeah, a little green guy.

44:14.210 --> 44:16.415
He tried to kill me!!

44:16.513 --> 44:17.983
Hello?

44:20.818 --> 44:23.857
The coin.
The bastard took my coin!

44:36.769 --> 44:39.741
Next time,
I'll take the elevator!

44:53.122 --> 44:54.223
Oh!

45:16.947 --> 45:19.720
I have been looking
all over hell for you.

45:19.817 --> 45:22.189
- You got the coin?
- Yes, I got the coin.

45:22.287 --> 45:23.923
I didn't find any money.

45:24.022 --> 45:25.257
- Gimme!
- Forget it!

45:25.358 --> 45:26.692
We're splitting it 50l50.

45:26.791 --> 45:28.595
We made a deal,
that coin belongs to me.

45:28.694 --> 45:30.998
I didn't get the money,
so now we're splitting it.

45:31.097 --> 45:33.434
I'm not gonna sell it,
you putz!

45:34.467 --> 45:35.435
It's got powers!

45:35.535 --> 45:37.037
What kind of powers?

45:37.137 --> 45:39.140
Put it on the table,
you won't believe this.

45:39.239 --> 45:40.642
It's amazing!

45:40.740 --> 45:41.809
Come on!

45:43.277 --> 45:45.882
I can't,
it's magically disappeared.

45:45.981 --> 45:48.618
- Put it on the table!
- All right. What number?

45:48.716 --> 45:50.453
Oh, iust any one!
Any one!

45:50.551 --> 45:51.887
1 1 black.

45:59.461 --> 46:00.964
I don't get it.

46:01.063 --> 46:03.368
Get what?
Are you losing your mind?

46:03.466 --> 46:06.940
lt moves!
It moves to the winning number!

46:07.037 --> 46:08.239
- By itself!
- Oh, I see!

46:08.338 --> 46:11.110
lt moves to the winning number
by itself, which means that...

46:11.208 --> 46:13.045
you're nuts!

46:13.143 --> 46:16.183
I gotta go do my show.
Find a coin dealer,

46:16.281 --> 46:18.986
get it appraised
and we will sell it.

46:19.083 --> 46:21.187
I swear,
on my mother's grave,

46:21.286 --> 46:23.090
it has magic.

46:23.189 --> 46:25.794
Loretta, darling,
if you want magic,

46:25.891 --> 46:28.729
bend over. I'll pull a rabbit
out of your ass.

46:28.827 --> 46:31.232
0o what I tell you.
I'll see you tonight.

46:31.330 --> 46:33.401
fazio!

46:33.499 --> 46:36.204
I know you've got work
to do backstage.

46:36.304 --> 46:37.406
I'm gone.

46:40.907 --> 46:42.410
He's gone.

46:43.344 --> 46:46.517
- 0id you get my money back yet?
- I'm working on it.

46:46.614 --> 46:47.582
- What's that?
- That's mine!

46:47.682 --> 46:49.786
That looks like gold to me.
Give me it.

46:49.884 --> 46:52.456
- Give me it!
- It's my personal property!

46:52.553 --> 46:55.626
I'm gonna keep this until
you get my money back for me.

46:55.724 --> 46:58.797
That's my personal property.
I want it back!

46:58.895 --> 47:00.029
Keep your voice down.

47:00.128 --> 47:03.368
One thing I can't stand
is a fat broad with a big mouth.

47:03.466 --> 47:05.938
Who's calling fat fat,
Mr. Porker?

47:07.037 --> 47:07.938
- Really!
- Yeah, really.

47:08.038 --> 47:10.942
You couldn't get a woman
if your life depended on it.

47:11.041 --> 47:14.046
I could have
any broad that I wanted.

47:14.144 --> 47:16.382
Like that bubblehead
little bimbo, Miss Tammy?

47:16.481 --> 47:19.053
Yeah, I could have
Tammy if I wanted her.

47:19.150 --> 47:20.453
Oh, you wish!

47:20.552 --> 47:21.854
Yeah...

47:21.953 --> 47:23.188
I wish!

47:27.693 --> 47:29.196
What was that?

47:31.731 --> 47:32.899
Oh!

47:33.933 --> 47:35.202
Ah!

47:36.770 --> 47:40.577
lf wishes were horses, a fat man
like you couldn't get in the saddle.

47:40.674 --> 47:42.811
Mitch!

47:42.910 --> 47:44.413
Tammy, what's the matter?

47:44.512 --> 47:46.683
- I want you.
- You do?

47:46.781 --> 47:50.789
I want you more than any man
I've ever known in my life.

47:50.886 --> 47:52.822
Have you got a fever?

47:52.921 --> 47:54.792
Oh, right now, Mitch!

47:54.890 --> 47:56.793
Take me!

47:56.892 --> 47:59.664
Take me right here!
On the floor!

48:01.097 --> 48:02.799
Oh! Oh!

48:03.666 --> 48:04.567
Yes!

48:06.036 --> 48:07.839
''fatso '' huh?

48:08.940 --> 48:11.378
Look, whatever it is,
don't change a thing.

48:11.476 --> 48:12.911
You iust stay like this.

48:13.011 --> 48:15.114
Oh, yes!

48:15.212 --> 48:16.848
Come on,
Iet's go to my room.

48:19.885 --> 48:23.259
Mandatory drug testing
for all employees, that's it.

48:23.822 --> 48:26.494
- Mitchy, Mitchy...
- We're going right to my room.

48:26.593 --> 48:29.733
- Oh, it's time, Mitchy.
- Oh, I'm ready!

48:32.766 --> 48:35.537
- I can get really nasty!
- You can?

48:35.635 --> 48:37.271
- Yeah!
- Then you just do it.

48:44.480 --> 48:46.616
- Come on, baby!
- Yeah!

48:49.352 --> 48:53.126
Wait a minute.
That's what he said.

48:53.222 --> 48:54.491
''l wish.''

49:05.636 --> 49:10.146
Oh, Mitchy,
where have you been all my life?

49:10.241 --> 49:12.546
I've been right here, baby,
waiting for you.

49:14.580 --> 49:15.683
Gimme a kiss!

49:15.781 --> 49:17.850
Oh, Mitchy!

49:17.949 --> 49:19.752
I like my loving...

49:19.852 --> 49:23.192
the same way
I like my men--

49:23.289 --> 49:24.424
- tough.
- Tough?

49:24.524 --> 49:26.995
And hard, like this.

49:27.092 --> 49:27.993
Whoa!

49:29.529 --> 49:32.067
Ooh, that's wonderful!

49:32.165 --> 49:35.372
I wanna make you feel it,
like this.

49:35.469 --> 49:37.606
Oh!

49:37.704 --> 49:40.109
Ooh!
you're turning me on!

49:40.207 --> 49:43.514
I think I got the idea.
Let me do it for you.

49:44.846 --> 49:46.616
Oh, Mitchy! Yeah!

49:48.050 --> 49:50.755
Oh, I love it! Ooh!

49:50.852 --> 49:53.224
Now, can we...
can we do it?

50:00.564 --> 50:03.169
My boxers
keep crawling up my butt.

50:03.267 --> 50:05.472
I hate that.
I go with jockeys now.

50:05.570 --> 50:07.841
lt kinda makes me feel
like a sissy.

50:07.939 --> 50:08.873
Yeah.

50:10.241 --> 50:12.211
You can't hang,
like you really want to...

50:15.448 --> 50:18.454
- How do you want it hanging?
- Loose. I wanna be comfortable.

50:18.552 --> 50:20.989
- I like the support.
- Oh, yeah? Feels good.

50:21.087 --> 50:22.957
- How's my tie look?
- Fine. Good.

50:24.324 --> 50:26.261
My socks are hanging
down my ankles.

50:26.359 --> 50:29.732
I wear those ones that come
over the calves, like tubers.

50:29.829 --> 50:33.671
I'd get those garters,
but they make me feel like a sissy.

50:35.570 --> 50:37.340
Where the hell is that guy?

50:41.275 --> 50:42.310
Enough with the pain.

50:42.411 --> 50:43.646
Okay, no more pain.

50:45.380 --> 50:50.556
Oh, sweetie, mama's
go n na make yo u feel so good!

50:50.653 --> 50:52.623
Oh, well, good is good,
pain is...

50:55.825 --> 50:59.800
What tasteful decor!

50:59.897 --> 51:02.301
Mitchy, it's like a museum.

51:02.399 --> 51:04.402
Let's do it...

51:04.502 --> 51:06.038
- Let's do it!
- Oh, Mitchy!

51:06.137 --> 51:08.709
- This is good.
- 0own, boy.

51:08.806 --> 51:09.808
Now, first...

51:09.908 --> 51:12.245
- First what?
- I'm gonna make you hot.

51:12.344 --> 51:14.114
- Yes, I like that.
- And then...

51:14.212 --> 51:16.850
- What?
- I'm gonna make you burn.

51:16.948 --> 51:18.685
Burn?

51:23.923 --> 51:25.660
Oh, boy!

51:35.303 --> 51:36.538
That--
that's very nice!

51:42.845 --> 51:44.747
Oh, that's nice,
that's good! yes!

51:57.628 --> 51:59.631
0o it! 0o it...
Yes!

52:03.900 --> 52:05.303
You got real talent.

52:23.490 --> 52:25.359
Whoo-whee-- yes!

52:32.868 --> 52:35.106
Have I got a wish for you!

52:40.543 --> 52:43.015
- Mitch?
- Come and get me, baby!

52:43.112 --> 52:46.318
What did you do to me?
How did you get me here?

52:46.415 --> 52:48.185
- Hey, wait!
- How did I get here?

52:48.284 --> 52:51.156
It's me, remember?
The loye mac hi ne! Come o n!

52:51.255 --> 52:52.992
Get away from me!
You letch!

52:54.859 --> 52:58.498
Oh-hh! You bitch!
You ballbreaking tease!

52:58.595 --> 53:01.100
You're fired
as of tonight!

53:01.199 --> 53:03.169
You're finished
i n s how business!

53:03.268 --> 53:05.706
You'll never get a iob
in this town again.

53:10.242 --> 53:13.481
Belongs to me,
this gold I smell.

53:13.580 --> 53:15.417
Whoever's got it
is going to hell.

53:44.614 --> 53:46.618
Ah, potatoes!

54:13.145 --> 54:15.349
I was gonna
make her a star.

54:17.484 --> 54:19.889
All she had to do
was cooperate.

54:24.826 --> 54:26.563
What the hell
is going on?

54:30.332 --> 54:32.101
What channel is this?

54:36.005 --> 54:39.312
What do you need her for, Mitch,
when you can have me?

54:40.410 --> 54:42.012
She called me Mitch?

54:44.014 --> 54:45.784
Take a look at these,
Mitch...

54:46.483 --> 54:47.719
Huh! Coincidence.

54:51.621 --> 54:53.057
I like this!

54:55.526 --> 54:58.933
Here you go!
Baked potato, broiled potato,

54:59.031 --> 55:02.671
french fries,
potato skins, potato salad

55:02.768 --> 55:06.175
and six potato pancakes.

55:06.271 --> 55:07.474
Anything else?

55:07.573 --> 55:10.545
There once was a lady
of Totten

55:10.643 --> 55:12.713
whose taste grew perverted
and rotten.

55:12.812 --> 55:16.987
She cared not for steaks,
or for pastries and cakes

55:17.083 --> 55:19.321
but lived upon
penis au gratin.

55:19.420 --> 55:21.558
Metallica!

55:21.656 --> 55:22.724
No, wait!

55:25.592 --> 55:28.699
White Zombie.
I've got the album.

55:30.398 --> 55:31.934
Enioy your spuds!

55:33.436 --> 55:35.372
What the hell
did I just say?

55:35.470 --> 55:38.076
I'm coming for you, Mitch!

55:38.174 --> 55:39.643
I must be dreaming.

55:39.743 --> 55:42.148
I'm coming!

55:42.245 --> 55:44.348
- Come on, baby!
- I can't wait to reach you.

55:44.447 --> 55:46.618
Well, come and get me!

55:50.822 --> 55:52.659
Oh!

55:56.627 --> 55:59.600
- I must be dreaming.
- No.

55:59.698 --> 56:01.501
- I'm not dreaming?
- No.

56:01.600 --> 56:05.874
- Ah, this is nice, this is good.
- Oh, Mitch!

56:05.971 --> 56:09.078
What can I do for you?
Where did you come from?

56:09.174 --> 56:10.977
- What's the difference?
- I'll show you...

56:11.078 --> 56:14.452
Hey, you want my heatseeking
moisture missile, don't you?

56:19.920 --> 56:23.060
What a lovely treat
for a fine lad like meself!

56:23.157 --> 56:26.630
What's wrong with me?
Why am I talking like that?

56:26.727 --> 56:27.996
- Hey, rich kid!
- Loretta!

56:28.096 --> 56:30.067
Eating up
all your winnings already!

56:30.165 --> 56:32.035
Where's Tammy?
Have you seen her?

56:32.135 --> 56:35.208
Ha! She's up in Mitch's office
getting her clock cleaned.

56:35.304 --> 56:36.305
What?!

56:36.405 --> 56:39.076
- Life's a bitch, ain't it?
- Where's Mitch's office?

56:39.175 --> 56:41.412
Third floor, room 31 8.

56:41.511 --> 56:43.883
Elevator left, then a right.
Bon appetit!

56:50.487 --> 56:52.825
That's the freak
that broke into my room!

56:54.126 --> 56:55.729
Oh, yeah, baby!

56:56.829 --> 56:58.765
Feeling sick?
Stubbed your toe?

56:58.863 --> 57:00.366
Call this lawyer.

57:00.465 --> 57:03.505
I'll fix your woe.
Agony is my business.

57:03.602 --> 57:05.707
I'll fight for you!

57:05.805 --> 57:07.508
Even you, Mitch!

57:07.607 --> 57:08.942
Oh, excuse me...

57:09.042 --> 57:11.045
You... did you hear
my name mentioned?

57:11.144 --> 57:12.547
- No.
- Oh, good!

57:15.315 --> 57:18.055
- Tammy! Are you all right?
- Stay away from me!

57:18.153 --> 57:20.289
What happened?
What's wrong?

57:20.387 --> 57:23.293
Nothing happened.
Nothing's wrong.

57:23.391 --> 57:25.161
Just business as usual.

57:25.259 --> 57:27.797
What did he do to you?
Tell me what he did!

57:27.897 --> 57:31.971
It's what he tried
to do, okay?

57:32.068 --> 57:35.508
It's not like this is the first time
this has happened to me.

57:35.605 --> 57:39.913
It's iust that this time,
along with everything else,

57:40.009 --> 57:43.917
I got fired.
So let's just forget it.

57:44.014 --> 57:49.091
No. I'm not gonna forget it.
And neither are you.

57:49.187 --> 57:52.827
lf we let him get away with it,
he'll do it again to somebody else.

57:52.924 --> 57:54.861
And I don't know
about you,

57:54.960 --> 57:57.131
but I'm not gonna
Iet that happen.

58:11.144 --> 58:15.686
Praise the Lord!
And send in your money!

58:15.783 --> 58:19.090
Otherwise, you're all doomed
to hellfire and damnation

58:19.188 --> 58:21.592
for fornicating
with the devil's harlot.

58:21.689 --> 58:25.630
Especially you, Mitch!
You're a prime offender!

58:25.728 --> 58:28.433
- Thatiust sounded like my name!
- No.

58:28.530 --> 58:30.066
- No?
- No.

58:35.537 --> 58:39.178
The signs point to
a tragedy about to happen.

58:40.778 --> 58:43.716
Casino owner dies...

58:43.814 --> 58:45.717
in a bed of lies.

58:45.816 --> 58:47.719
Whoa!

58:47.818 --> 58:50.658
- That was my name, right?
- Yes!

58:50.756 --> 58:52.526
Oh, shit.

58:54.726 --> 58:57.131
What the hell
is happening here?

58:57.230 --> 58:59.835
No, no!
Get off of me!

59:01.868 --> 59:02.769
Oh!

59:06.974 --> 59:08.977
Where the hell is that asshole?
Come on!

59:10.177 --> 59:13.450
A dream,
this is a bad dream!

59:18.119 --> 59:22.261
You'll get what's due
when I electrocute you!

59:32.836 --> 59:35.207
Scott.. .

59:35.305 --> 59:36.741
thank you.

59:43.514 --> 59:45.216
- Mitch...
- Sir?

59:46.351 --> 59:47.487
My God!

59:51.090 --> 59:52.693
Oh, Scott!

59:54.327 --> 59:56.898
Where's me shilling?

59:57.763 --> 59:59.500
You again?

59:59.598 --> 01:00:01.001
Now, me boyo,

01:00:01.101 --> 01:00:03.473
it's time to cut you
down to size.

01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:04.638
Who are you?

01:00:07.907 --> 01:00:09.310
Let's get out of here!

01:00:09.409 --> 01:00:13.351
Mitch, I want my money,
and I want my money now.

01:00:13.447 --> 01:00:15.618
What the hell's
going on here?

01:00:21.723 --> 01:00:23.126
You're in
a lot of trouble.

01:00:23.226 --> 01:00:25.664
- Out of me way!
- Hey! Stay there.

01:00:25.762 --> 01:00:28.166
I know you, you're that guy
from the craps table.

01:00:28.264 --> 01:00:31.003
You know, you really should see
a dermatologist or something,

01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:32.269
that's really bad.

01:00:32.369 --> 01:00:34.941
Beauty is in the eye
of the beholder.

01:00:35.773 --> 01:00:37.009
Ahhh!

01:00:48.586 --> 01:00:50.323
That really hurt!

01:00:56.997 --> 01:00:58.265
We dance.

01:01:09.643 --> 01:01:13.117
Tell me, what was
Judy Garland really like?

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:27.400
They should have been willing
to give me me shilling.

01:01:27.497 --> 01:01:30.401
But I've done well
by sending them to hell!

01:01:35.039 --> 01:01:37.444
What are we gonna do?
He's a monster!

01:01:37.541 --> 01:01:40.680
Nobody's gonna believe us
if we tell them what we've seen!

01:01:40.778 --> 01:01:42.214
Oh!

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:47.320
Scott, what's wrong?

01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:49.691
I don't know...

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:51.023
My insides...

01:01:51.122 --> 01:01:53.227
It's like everything's
twisted up.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:55.563
Oh, my God!

01:01:55.661 --> 01:01:57.531
What is it?
What's wrong?

01:01:57.630 --> 01:01:58.966
Your face!

01:01:59.066 --> 01:02:00.602
I'm in trouble, Tammy.

01:02:01.734 --> 01:02:03.104
Help me!

01:02:05.606 --> 01:02:08.578
Scott,
we gotta get out of here.

01:02:08.676 --> 01:02:10.111
Like you said...

01:02:10.211 --> 01:02:12.214
who's gonna believe us?

01:02:12.313 --> 01:02:13.582
I don't know...

01:02:16.551 --> 01:02:18.388
That's where
it all happened.

01:02:18.487 --> 01:02:20.625
- Where?
- At the pawn shop across the street.

01:02:20.723 --> 01:02:24.330
That's where I found the coin.
I think that's where the answer is.

01:02:24.427 --> 01:02:26.364
Let's go check it out.

01:02:30.567 --> 01:02:32.571
Huh! I smell me shilling...

01:02:34.638 --> 01:02:38.212
and the gentle fragrance
of a lady's perfume.

01:02:43.415 --> 01:02:45.685
Let it work,
Iet it work, let it work!

01:02:47.453 --> 01:02:49.356
Let me be beautiful.

01:02:50.857 --> 01:02:53.928
Give me the body
of a stacked 20 year-old.

01:02:57.697 --> 01:02:58.765
Please...

01:03:01.101 --> 01:03:03.739
I wanna be sexy...

01:03:03.837 --> 01:03:05.874
and beautiful again.

01:03:08.776 --> 01:03:10.279
I wish.

01:03:22.725 --> 01:03:23.894
Yeah!

01:03:27.197 --> 01:03:28.599
Enter!

01:03:33.771 --> 01:03:35.240
Loretta?

01:03:35.341 --> 01:03:37.777
That's right, sweetheart!

01:03:37.875 --> 01:03:39.545
Little ol' me.

01:03:39.644 --> 01:03:43.251
0idn't I tell you one of these days
I was gonna turn it around?

01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:45.520
But how?

01:03:45.619 --> 01:03:47.254
Magic.

01:03:47.353 --> 01:03:48.856
All I had to do...

01:03:48.954 --> 01:03:50.290
was wish for it.

01:03:51.858 --> 01:03:53.595
Pretty! Yours?

01:03:56.197 --> 01:03:59.235
Man, oh, man,
o h Manisc heyitz!

01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:01.070
Look at those tits!

01:04:01.168 --> 01:04:06.012
I wish I was a man so I could iust
screw myself right on the floor.

01:04:06.108 --> 01:04:08.512
And I dare you
to feel that ass, Fazio.

01:04:08.610 --> 01:04:10.180
That's prime.

01:04:10.278 --> 01:04:12.348
All you had to do
was wish for it?

01:04:12.447 --> 01:04:13.650
You got it!

01:04:13.749 --> 01:04:16.187
- Thanks!
- You! Give that back to me!

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:18.288
Give it back!
Give it back right now!

01:04:19.455 --> 01:04:21.325
Thanks for the loan, Loretta.
I owe you.

01:04:22.493 --> 01:04:24.663
You flaming faggot!

01:04:27.164 --> 01:04:30.036
But since there's a mirror
in the room,

01:04:30.134 --> 01:04:32.271
I might as well
stick around...

01:04:33.704 --> 01:04:35.174
and enioy it!

01:04:41.046 --> 01:04:43.986
All right,
this had better work!

01:04:44.083 --> 01:04:45.251
I wish...

01:04:48.889 --> 01:04:50.257
I wish...

01:04:50.356 --> 01:04:53.964
that I was the greatest magician
in the world!

01:05:07.142 --> 01:05:10.348
I am iust so damn
gorgeous!

01:05:10.446 --> 01:05:14.353
They're gonna want me like
they never wanted anybody before.

01:05:15.618 --> 01:05:17.588
And I'm gonna
make 'em pay.

01:05:20.424 --> 01:05:21.893
Who the hell are you?

01:05:21.991 --> 01:05:23.994
I'm a leprechaun, me lass,

01:05:24.094 --> 01:05:25.831
and I'm gonna make you pay!

01:05:29.534 --> 01:05:30.602
What do you want?

01:05:30.702 --> 01:05:33.173
Your boobs are big,
your butt is small,

01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:35.642
but still you're in
for quite a fall!

01:05:35.741 --> 01:05:37.077
What are you talking about?

01:05:37.175 --> 01:05:39.179
Oh, what,
didn't you hear?

01:05:39.278 --> 01:05:41.782
Bigger is good,
butjumbo is dear.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:44.151
I'll give you boobs
that come out to here.

01:05:50.290 --> 01:05:51.693
My babies!

01:05:54.628 --> 01:05:56.298
What are you doing
to my babies?

01:05:57.766 --> 01:06:01.039
Those delightful lips,
they'll get you some tips.

01:06:01.136 --> 01:06:04.910
But what about these?
Aren't they big enough to please?

01:06:05.006 --> 01:06:07.243
No! What are you doing?

01:06:13.149 --> 01:06:15.386
Oh, a delightful little slut!

01:06:15.484 --> 01:06:17.255
But what about your butt?

01:06:22.859 --> 01:06:25.263
You little monster!

01:06:25.362 --> 01:06:27.266
Oh, my God!

01:06:51.392 --> 01:06:53.429
Feels like rain!

01:07:08.310 --> 01:07:10.983
Now that was quite a load
to have to explode!

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:14.019
What a lovely lass!
I had to blow up your ass!

01:07:14.116 --> 01:07:15.920
But now
I must hit the road.

01:07:24.629 --> 01:07:26.833
That's where I found
the poor guy lying.

01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:28.833
And you think
the leprechaun did it?

01:07:28.932 --> 01:07:30.135
Who else?

01:07:31.570 --> 01:07:33.774
Now, there was something
on the computer...

01:07:33.873 --> 01:07:36.211
about gold coins and wishes...

01:07:36.308 --> 01:07:39.380
Finding the
Ieprechaun's gold is hard to do.

01:07:39.478 --> 01:07:42.751
He sometimes keeps it in his hat,
or hides it in the loo.

01:07:42.849 --> 01:07:43.850
That's a big help.

01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:46.989
lf you destroy his gold,
you destroy the leprechaun,

01:07:47.087 --> 01:07:49.926
but mortals can never
resist the power of gold.

01:07:50.023 --> 01:07:51.893
To them, being rich
is more important...

01:07:51.992 --> 01:07:53.830
than doing
what needs to be done.

01:07:53.928 --> 01:07:54.896
No way!

01:07:54.996 --> 01:07:57.101
We find that gold,
we're getting rid of it!

01:07:57.199 --> 01:08:00.003
Oh, no!
How can you say that, darling?

01:08:00.101 --> 01:08:01.203
What?

01:08:01.303 --> 01:08:03.306
I didn't say that.
0id l?

01:08:04.139 --> 01:08:05.140
Oh!

01:08:06.209 --> 01:08:07.177
What's wrong?

01:08:07.277 --> 01:08:09.046
- Get it out of sight!
- What is it?

01:08:09.144 --> 01:08:10.246
Get it out!

01:08:10.346 --> 01:08:13.085
Okay.
Is that better?

01:08:13.182 --> 01:08:14.652
Yeah.

01:08:14.752 --> 01:08:16.522
I'm okay, l--

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:18.624
I feel so weird...

01:08:18.723 --> 01:08:21.227
Scott, I think we should
just get in your car

01:08:21.325 --> 01:08:23.930
and get out of here.
While we still can.

01:08:24.028 --> 01:08:25.663
I can't.

01:08:25.764 --> 01:08:27.835
You need to see a doctor.

01:08:27.934 --> 01:08:29.770
Not yet.

01:08:29.868 --> 01:08:31.738
There's something here,

01:08:31.837 --> 01:08:35.912
something I need
or want very badly.

01:08:36.008 --> 01:08:38.580
I don't know what it is.

01:08:38.679 --> 01:08:40.548
Maybe you should go.

01:08:40.645 --> 01:08:43.251
No way.
I'm not leaving you, Scott.

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:56.832
Wow.

01:08:56.932 --> 01:08:58.835
Look at all this stuff.

01:09:01.703 --> 01:09:04.341
Yeah, it's like
a junkyard in here.

01:09:05.607 --> 01:09:07.444
Spooky!

01:09:08.812 --> 01:09:10.850
What exactly
are we looking for?

01:09:10.948 --> 01:09:12.582
I'm not sure.

01:09:12.682 --> 01:09:14.519
Some clue
as to what happened to me.

01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:33.573
Wait here, darlin'.
I think I'm onto somethin'.

01:09:53.928 --> 01:09:55.731
I can smell it!

01:09:56.765 --> 01:09:58.636
0elicious!

01:10:15.152 --> 01:10:18.124
Oh! Isn't it lovely?

01:10:18.221 --> 01:10:20.359
A pot of gold for the taking.

01:10:33.105 --> 01:10:36.077
- Scott, you found it!
- Aye, that I did!

01:10:36.175 --> 01:10:37.311
We can destroy it.

01:10:37.410 --> 01:10:38.779
Remember
what the computer said?

01:10:38.878 --> 01:10:42.386
lf we destroy the gold, we get rid
of the leprechaun once and for all.

01:10:42.483 --> 01:10:43.651
0estroy it?

01:10:43.751 --> 01:10:45.788
Yeah! We have to.

01:10:45.886 --> 01:10:48.324
No, lass.
We need to study it.

01:10:48.422 --> 01:10:51.161
We need to look at
whatjingles and jangles.

01:10:51.258 --> 01:10:54.365
For science, you know,
is the study of angles.

01:10:54.463 --> 01:10:56.667
Scott!
What is happening?

01:10:56.765 --> 01:10:58.268
Nothing.

01:10:58.366 --> 01:10:59.736
Nothing, my beauty,
nothing at all.

01:10:59.836 --> 01:11:01.171
I'm iust being sensible.

01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:02.872
No, you're not!

01:11:02.973 --> 01:11:05.411
0on't take
a leprechaun's gold!

01:11:05.509 --> 01:11:08.213
Not if you want to live
to be ripe and old.

01:11:08.311 --> 01:11:10.114
- You're hurting me!
- Am l?

01:11:12.716 --> 01:11:14.319
Wow!

01:11:14.418 --> 01:11:15.888
What happened?

01:11:15.987 --> 01:11:18.291
I don't know, but don't
Iet it happen again,

01:11:18.388 --> 01:11:20.259
because you're scaring
me to death.

01:11:20.358 --> 01:11:22.361
lf anyone's
scared to death...

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:24.565
then let it be me
doing the scaring.

01:11:25.498 --> 01:11:26.934
What...?

01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:29.337
I don't like
what I'm seeing.

01:11:29.435 --> 01:11:31.873
Two leprechauns
is one too many, lad.

01:11:33.172 --> 01:11:35.243
Scott! The gold!
The gold! Make a wish!

01:11:35.342 --> 01:11:36.644
Wish him dead!

01:11:36.744 --> 01:11:39.013
All right, little monster!

01:11:39.112 --> 01:11:43.020
I wish you were encased in cement
at the bottom of the ocean!

01:11:43.117 --> 01:11:45.755
Oh, no, please!
Anything but that!

01:11:48.090 --> 01:11:49.892
You silly little twit!

01:11:49.992 --> 01:11:51.862
Have you forgotten
the charm?

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:53.963
A leprechaun's gold

01:11:54.062 --> 01:11:55.966
can do him no harm!

01:11:59.768 --> 01:12:00.669
Scott!

01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:02.105
Oh!

01:12:02.204 --> 01:12:04.409
So,
for pulling this trick,

01:12:04.507 --> 01:12:05.877
I'll chop off your dick!

01:12:11.148 --> 01:12:12.718
Oh, me little darling!

01:12:19.025 --> 01:12:20.059
Oh!

01:12:21.193 --> 01:12:22.128
- Come on!
- Nice pitch!

01:12:22.227 --> 01:12:24.130
I pitch for
the Vegas All Stars.

01:12:25.798 --> 01:12:27.301
Oh, me aching noggin!

01:12:34.407 --> 01:12:38.015
When I catch up with those two
I'll give them a good scragging.

01:12:50.593 --> 01:12:51.560
Oh!

01:12:51.659 --> 01:12:53.563
Oh, no, Scott!
Is it starting again?

01:12:53.662 --> 01:12:55.198
Yeah.

01:12:55.297 --> 01:12:56.532
My insides...

01:12:56.632 --> 01:12:58.770
I feel like
I'm being torn apart.

01:12:59.936 --> 01:13:01.706
Oh, no!

01:13:01.806 --> 01:13:03.742
Scott, we're going
to the hospital now!

01:13:05.775 --> 01:13:06.978
Get in!

01:13:17.388 --> 01:13:20.628
You can run, me boyo,
but yo u can't hide!

01:13:23.595 --> 01:13:25.031
Scott!

01:13:25.131 --> 01:13:27.936
- What happened?
- He bit me.

01:13:28.034 --> 01:13:29.804
At the casino.

01:13:29.903 --> 01:13:32.541
Miss! Miss!

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.941
Jesus Christ!

01:13:34.041 --> 01:13:37.247
- Can we get some help here?
- What's the trouble here?

01:13:40.081 --> 01:13:41.851
What the hell is this?

01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:44.989
Get me a gurney.
Get this man into isolation, stat!

01:13:47.722 --> 01:13:48.857
Come on!

01:13:49.892 --> 01:13:52.029
- Just wait here.
- No, I wanna be with him.

01:13:52.128 --> 01:13:55.334
Nobody's gonna be with him
until we know what the problem is.

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:56.633
God!

01:14:01.371 --> 01:14:02.873
Get out of the road!

01:14:14.753 --> 01:14:16.755
Oh!

01:14:25.465 --> 01:14:27.836
Looks like some kind
of virulent fungus.

01:14:27.934 --> 01:14:29.537
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:14:29.636 --> 01:14:31.874
Hmm... must be metastasizing
down the right quadrant,

01:14:31.972 --> 01:14:33.875
moving into
the lower thoracic area.

01:14:33.974 --> 01:14:36.212
Let's get this man
on antibiotics right away!

01:14:42.651 --> 01:14:43.986
Hold him,
for God's sake!

01:14:44.086 --> 01:14:46.090
Take it easy, son.
We're here to help.

01:15:10.749 --> 01:15:12.786
Give him a sedative,
damn it!

01:15:13.718 --> 01:15:15.054
Now listen to me!

01:15:15.154 --> 01:15:17.325
This may mean the difference
between living and dying.

01:15:19.859 --> 01:15:21.929
0o you have health insurance?

01:15:22.027 --> 01:15:23.898
0o you take Green Cross?

01:15:28.468 --> 01:15:29.602
Good God!

01:15:31.305 --> 01:15:33.008
Forktus glottis!

01:16:12.918 --> 01:16:15.323
What the hell
is taking them so long?

01:16:15.421 --> 01:16:19.296
Tammy Larson,
please report to the morgue.

01:16:19.393 --> 01:16:20.361
Oh, no!

01:16:20.461 --> 01:16:23.500
Tammy Larson,
please report to the morgue.

01:16:29.670 --> 01:16:31.774
0octor, look at this!

01:16:34.708 --> 01:16:36.913
- This is blood?
- What the hell is going on?

01:16:37.011 --> 01:16:38.814
Bring me
his encephalogram.

01:16:43.618 --> 01:16:44.519
Really?

01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:48.160
Where's his EKG?

01:16:52.728 --> 01:16:57.205
lf this is some sort ofioke,
I don't find it at all amusing.

01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:06.212
Well, maybe he doesn't
need health insurance.

01:17:06.311 --> 01:17:10.285
Wow! Should I order
a few more tests, doctor?

01:17:10.383 --> 01:17:11.318
Let's see, uh...

01:17:11.417 --> 01:17:14.723
He can afford an MRl, and
Iet's give him a couple more EKGs,

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:17.993
- and he can use a spinal tap.
- Maybe a bone scan?

01:17:18.091 --> 01:17:20.830
Let's start with every test
beginning with the letter A,

01:17:20.927 --> 01:17:22.030
tomorrow the B's,

01:17:22.129 --> 01:17:23.732
- and Thursday...
- You play golf on Thursday.

01:17:23.831 --> 01:17:25.934
Well, this is an emergency.

01:17:29.703 --> 01:17:30.704
Hello?

01:17:32.507 --> 01:17:33.710
Hello?

01:17:35.176 --> 01:17:36.545
ls anybody here?

01:17:40.048 --> 01:17:41.351
Hello?

01:17:47.957 --> 01:17:49.760
Hello? Sir?

01:17:51.228 --> 01:17:52.664
Excuse me?

01:17:54.399 --> 01:17:55.501
Sir?

01:17:58.835 --> 01:18:00.672
Excuse me, sir...

01:18:12.251 --> 01:18:13.721
Oh, God! No!

01:18:21.127 --> 01:18:23.098
Let me go,
you son of a bitch!

01:18:24.198 --> 01:18:27.704
Now, that's no way to speak about
me mother, bless her greedy soul.

01:18:44.921 --> 01:18:47.159
Now, me boyos,
I'll be checking out!

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:51.028
Take care
of the patient!

01:18:51.128 --> 01:18:53.098
Ah, an angel of mercy!

01:18:58.136 --> 01:18:59.771
Nurse!
Take this patient!

01:19:17.558 --> 01:19:20.296
Now that's what I call
managed health care.

01:19:24.698 --> 01:19:26.535
What's that I smell?

01:19:26.635 --> 01:19:29.006
Would it be
me brother from hell?

01:19:30.071 --> 01:19:30.806
Right.

01:19:30.905 --> 01:19:33.844
Now that you're in place,
I'll slice up your face.

01:19:33.941 --> 01:19:35.945
Oh, no!
Scott!

01:19:36.045 --> 01:19:37.615
Scott, help me!
Please!

01:19:38.947 --> 01:19:41.084
Now don't be afraid,
Iass.

01:19:41.183 --> 01:19:42.719
I'll only remove
the front part.

01:19:42.818 --> 01:19:44.454
No, please!

01:19:44.554 --> 01:19:46.425
I want me shilling!

01:19:46.524 --> 01:19:49.563
I don't have it.
I swear, I don't have it.

01:19:51.361 --> 01:19:53.099
What a pity.

01:19:53.197 --> 01:19:55.635
What? I don't suppose
you want that nose...

01:19:55.733 --> 01:19:58.338
There will be no charge
for removing it.

01:19:58.437 --> 01:20:00.174
No! No! No!

01:20:01.673 --> 01:20:03.811
Cut her nose and
I'll hack off your toes!

01:20:10.718 --> 01:20:12.287
Back off,
you renegade,

01:20:12.385 --> 01:20:14.923
before I make you
eat that blade!

01:20:15.021 --> 01:20:16.924
Power to power,

01:20:17.024 --> 01:20:18.861
you've much to learn,

01:20:18.959 --> 01:20:20.595
taller or shorter,

01:20:20.695 --> 01:20:22.431
I'll make you burn.

01:20:24.432 --> 01:20:25.534
Whoa!

01:20:28.236 --> 01:20:30.139
Now where's me shilling?

01:20:30.239 --> 01:20:32.076
Fazio's the one
with your shilling!

01:20:32.174 --> 01:20:33.943
It's him
you should be killing!

01:20:35.211 --> 01:20:36.279
Fazio's magic,

01:20:36.378 --> 01:20:38.048
pathetic and lame,

01:20:38.147 --> 01:20:39.850
will soon turn tragic

01:20:39.949 --> 01:20:41.787
and me shilling I'll claim!

01:20:50.027 --> 01:20:52.599
Leave him alone.
You've got what you want.

01:20:52.698 --> 01:20:54.901
No, me dear,
you shall not pass.

01:20:54.999 --> 01:20:57.069
I'll raise me boot
and kick your...

01:20:57.168 --> 01:20:58.604
Aaah!

01:21:07.012 --> 01:21:08.548
Put it away!

01:21:11.752 --> 01:21:16.327
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Burning Beauty!

01:21:21.061 --> 01:21:24.234
A new illusion
I have just developed!

01:21:24.332 --> 01:21:28.206
Now, for the first time
on any stage,

01:21:28.303 --> 01:21:31.175
our lovely volunteer
from the audience...

01:21:31.273 --> 01:21:34.881
trapped inside
a burning hell...

01:21:38.414 --> 01:21:39.850
Will she come out alive?

01:21:41.385 --> 01:21:43.322
Or medium well?

01:21:52.463 --> 01:21:54.634
He's going after
the shilling.

01:21:54.733 --> 01:21:56.269
Fazio has it.

01:21:57.837 --> 01:22:00.876
I've got to destroy him
to save meself.

01:22:00.972 --> 01:22:03.177
ls that possible?
Will that work?

01:22:03.275 --> 01:22:05.580
I feel it.

01:22:05.679 --> 01:22:07.849
I'm part of whatever he is.

01:22:07.947 --> 01:22:10.218
Well, maybe we won't
have to destroy him.

01:22:10.317 --> 01:22:13.924
lf we can find the shilling,
we can wish you back to normal.

01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:15.823
Listen to me.

01:22:15.923 --> 01:22:17.759
I don't want you
going in with me.

01:22:17.859 --> 01:22:20.564
When we get to the casino,
drop me off.

01:22:20.661 --> 01:22:23.567
I want you to get out of there.
Go someplace safe.

01:22:23.665 --> 01:22:24.767
No!

01:22:25.901 --> 01:22:27.938
We started
this together.

01:22:28.036 --> 01:22:29.838
We're gonna
finish it that way.

01:22:33.643 --> 01:22:35.613
And now,
a word of warning.

01:22:35.713 --> 01:22:39.653
lf any of you in the audience
are the least bit squeamish,

01:22:39.749 --> 01:22:43.056
I suggest
you leave the theatre.

01:22:43.153 --> 01:22:47.529
Fazio's illusions
are very, very...

01:22:47.626 --> 01:22:48.761
real!

01:23:10.784 --> 01:23:13.322
- Who the hell are you?
- No reason for alarm.

01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:15.892
Give me the coin
and you'll come to no harm.

01:23:17.792 --> 01:23:21.031
lt'd be a cold day in hell
before I give up this coin,

01:23:21.129 --> 01:23:23.433
so take a hike
before I call security?

01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:24.867
You're making a mistake.

01:23:24.966 --> 01:23:27.004
As a magician,
you're a pathetic fake.

01:23:35.211 --> 01:23:37.181
Scott, hang on!
We're almost there!

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:38.549
Hang on!

01:23:49.394 --> 01:23:51.766
Get me out of this thing.
Get me out!

01:23:51.864 --> 01:23:54.668
A pleasure it'll be
to get you out, and set you free--

01:23:56.468 --> 01:23:58.004
with this!

01:24:02.008 --> 01:24:03.243
With Fazio the Great

01:24:03.343 --> 01:24:04.745
we had a good laugh.

01:24:04.844 --> 01:24:06.480
Shall I start up this saw

01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:07.949
and cut him in half?

01:24:08.047 --> 01:24:09.316
Yeah or nay?

01:24:09.416 --> 01:24:11.253
Audience; yes, yes, yes!

01:24:12.454 --> 01:24:13.421
No!

01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:16.025
No, no!

01:24:17.959 --> 01:24:19.863
My audience, no!
Nó, you loye me!

01:24:19.962 --> 01:24:21.130
you loye me, no!

01:24:22.798 --> 01:24:24.500
I can't hear you!

01:24:39.082 --> 01:24:39.983
Oh, no!

01:24:40.083 --> 01:24:41.051
Now, me boyo,

01:24:41.151 --> 01:24:43.022
where's me shilling?

01:24:43.121 --> 01:24:44.489
You're bluffing!

01:24:44.589 --> 01:24:46.626
There's a whole room
full of witnesses.

01:24:46.724 --> 01:24:48.360
Oh, too bad!

01:24:48.459 --> 01:24:50.229
Forcing me
to split in two

01:24:50.329 --> 01:24:52.399
a nice young lad
such as you.

01:24:54.901 --> 01:24:58.007
I wish I was in
Caesar's Palace right now!

01:24:58.103 --> 01:25:00.207
No, lad.
You've had your wish.

01:25:00.306 --> 01:25:02.343
Now I'll have mine.

01:25:07.113 --> 01:25:08.281
Aahh!

01:25:10.351 --> 01:25:12.021
This way!

01:25:40.785 --> 01:25:42.287
Caesar's Palace...

01:26:00.774 --> 01:26:03.279
- Liste n to me , eyerybody!
- This man's a ma\codeiac#

01:26:03.376 --> 01:26:06.850
For your own safety,
get out of the room!

01:26:09.917 --> 01:26:11.453
Come on, everybody out,
hurry!

01:26:13.789 --> 01:26:14.891
Aaah!

01:26:36.747 --> 01:26:37.716
Hurry, hurry!

01:26:37.816 --> 01:26:39.151
Oh, God!

01:26:39.250 --> 01:26:40.785
Scott!
The shilling!

01:26:40.885 --> 01:26:42.221
I wish Scott was...

01:26:45.023 --> 01:26:46.894
No wish for you,
darling.

01:26:46.993 --> 01:26:49.063
Now I'll peel you
like a grape.

01:26:49.162 --> 01:26:50.664
Hold it!

01:26:52.932 --> 01:26:54.000
Now wait, lad.

01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:55.971
What are you doing?
We're brothers.

01:26:56.069 --> 01:26:57.972
I don't think so.

01:27:05.279 --> 01:27:07.417
Scott.. .

01:27:07.515 --> 01:27:10.187
come over to the green side.
I'll make you rich.

01:27:13.855 --> 01:27:15.158
There it is,

01:27:15.256 --> 01:27:16.826
yours for the taking.

01:27:16.926 --> 01:27:18.529
You'll share nothing!

01:27:18.627 --> 01:27:20.530
I know how you are,
you're only bluffing.

01:27:20.630 --> 01:27:22.299
Trust me, lad,

01:27:22.398 --> 01:27:24.301
one devilish creature
to another.

01:27:29.673 --> 01:27:31.477
Ah! That's me boy.

01:27:31.576 --> 01:27:33.045
We're alike,
me and you.

01:27:33.144 --> 01:27:34.814
Evil as hell
all the way thro'ugh.

01:27:36.314 --> 01:27:37.582
No, Scott!

01:27:40.018 --> 01:27:42.123
He's not like you!

01:27:42.222 --> 01:27:44.191
0on't listen to him.

01:27:47.227 --> 01:27:48.495
She's right!

01:27:48.594 --> 01:27:50.365
I'm not like you.

01:27:50.463 --> 01:27:52.200
I'll never be like you!

01:27:52.298 --> 01:27:54.802
Put it down, lad,
you can't hurt me.

01:27:54.901 --> 01:27:57.206
You should know that by now.

01:27:57.303 --> 01:27:59.140
Think of the gold, Scott,

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:01.078
the power it can give you.

01:28:01.176 --> 01:28:03.179
The gold, Scott.

01:28:03.277 --> 01:28:05.414
His power lies in the gold.

01:28:05.512 --> 01:28:07.884
We'll share it, I promise.

01:28:07.983 --> 01:28:09.853
Share this, pal!

01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:12.923
Aaargh!

01:28:13.022 --> 01:28:14.124
No, me gold!

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:15.358
Aaargh!

01:28:41.687 --> 01:28:42.955
Scott... Scott!

01:28:52.632 --> 01:28:55.237
Oh, my God!
You're back!

01:28:55.335 --> 01:28:57.238
You're normal again.

01:29:02.343 --> 01:29:04.013
Oh, I can't believe it!

01:29:19.996 --> 01:29:23.871
I can't wait to get out of here
and leave this nightmare behind.

01:29:23.967 --> 01:29:26.739
Well, we won't be
Ieaving it all behind.

01:29:26.837 --> 01:29:28.339
What do you mean?

01:29:28.438 --> 01:29:30.509
I found this.

01:29:30.607 --> 01:29:32.510
What do you think?

01:29:32.609 --> 01:29:35.081
We can have iust about
anything we want.

01:29:38.650 --> 01:29:40.085
It's your call.

01:29:46.059 --> 01:29:47.528
I don't know...

01:29:47.627 --> 01:29:50.098
I think I have
everything I want.

01:29:53.767 --> 01:29:55.337
You know something,
sweetheart?

01:29:55.435 --> 01:29:58.207
This could be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
