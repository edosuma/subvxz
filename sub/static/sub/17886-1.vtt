DROP DEAD!

03:01.647 --> 03:05.242
Det. Horibe, were you and Nishi
classmates in junior high?

03:05.407 --> 03:07.238
In senior high, too.

03:07.487 --> 03:09.523
And your wives are friends, too?

03:09.687 --> 03:12.440
That's right.
Do you remember, Nishi?

03:12.887 --> 03:14.479
At the amusement park.

03:14.647 --> 03:16.603
We picked them up, didn't we?

03:16.767 --> 03:18.439
Nishi got the pretty one

03:18.687 --> 03:20.279
and I got the dog.

03:21.007 --> 03:22.599
What are you laughing at?

03:23.167 --> 03:24.361
Hey, stop the car.

03:24.527 --> 03:26.358
Go get some bean cakes.

03:26.527 --> 03:27.676
Yes, sir.

03:41.527 --> 03:43.279
How is your wife?

03:46.127 --> 03:48.402
It's been two years, hasn't it?

03:50.367 --> 03:54.485
My wife is healthy as hell,
but it must be tough for you.

03:56.407 --> 03:58.557
Been to the hospital lately?

03:58.727 --> 04:01.480
The stakeout's near the hospital.
Go see her.

04:02.167 --> 04:04.727
Go on.
We don't have much to do today.

04:14.607 --> 04:16.598
- How much?
- 1,200 yen.

04:16.767 --> 04:19.644
- For bean cakes?
- Yes, just the bean cakes.

04:19.807 --> 04:23.800
Idiot! There's too much
for the 3 of us! You pay for it.

04:24.047 --> 04:25.275
But...

04:25.607 --> 04:27.199
These are the wrong ones.

04:27.367 --> 04:30.279
- Were there any chestnut ones?
- Steamed?

04:30.447 --> 04:32.438
Not the hot spring kind!

04:32.807 --> 04:37.085
It's straight to the amusement park
with no sleep for me tomorrow.

04:37.247 --> 04:39.442
I spoil my daughter.

04:46.767 --> 04:49.839
Smart place to park!
I can't even get out!

04:51.127 --> 04:52.765
I'll go check.

05:10.047 --> 05:12.402
Don't play ball here, you idiots!

05:16.127 --> 05:17.162
Sorry!

05:26.847 --> 05:27.916
Well?

05:28.087 --> 05:29.839
No way he'd come here.

05:30.007 --> 05:33.636
He won't come back to his apartment
after that massacre.

05:34.047 --> 05:36.003
What's the chief thinking of?

05:36.167 --> 05:37.486
I know.

05:37.647 --> 05:40.605
Is that how you dress
for a stakeout?

05:41.007 --> 05:42.998
You're not on a date.

05:43.367 --> 05:47.076
Nishi's going to the hospital.
Can you stay on?

05:47.567 --> 05:49.285
Well, I have a date...

05:49.447 --> 05:50.926
Screw you!

05:51.527 --> 05:53.483
How is Nishi's wife?

05:54.247 --> 05:56.203
Not too good, I hear.

05:56.887 --> 05:58.320
Is it cancer?

05:58.887 --> 06:00.479
Watch what you say.

06:01.807 --> 06:03.718
First their daughter died...

06:03.887 --> 06:06.276
She was only 4 or 5, wasn't she?

06:06.447 --> 06:09.166
That was a bigger shock
than her illness.

06:10.847 --> 06:13.361
I visited his wife a while back.

06:13.527 --> 06:15.358
She didn't say a word.

06:16.087 --> 06:18.157
I'm glad my wife is so healthy.

06:18.327 --> 06:20.158
Must be hard on Nishi.

06:20.327 --> 06:23.956
Daughter dies, wife gets sick,
and he's a damn cop.

06:25.487 --> 06:27.796
So busy he can't even visit her.

06:28.327 --> 06:29.806
I'll stay on.

06:30.007 --> 06:32.646
Not you, Tanaka.
You're a family man.

06:32.887 --> 06:35.196
Come on, stay on for 3 hours.

06:35.607 --> 06:37.165
No, I can't.

06:37.887 --> 06:40.355
OK, I'll stay. You can go.

06:54.167 --> 06:55.839
Can I get a lift?

07:00.447 --> 07:02.119
How's your wife?

07:03.087 --> 07:05.237
I'll go visit her some time.

07:18.927 --> 07:20.360
Hello. It's me.

07:21.407 --> 07:23.238
I'm not coming home tonight.

07:23.887 --> 07:25.240
I know that.

07:25.847 --> 07:27.997
What can I do? It's my job.

07:28.207 --> 07:29.925
Let me talk to Michi.

07:31.567 --> 07:33.637
Michi, it's daddy.

07:34.807 --> 07:36.399
I'm at work.

07:37.487 --> 07:40.047
The amusement park? Another time.

07:41.327 --> 07:45.240
What? You drew a picture?
Where did you draw it?

07:52.287 --> 07:54.437
You shouldn't do that.

07:54.887 --> 07:57.355
Yes, it's very pretty.

08:55.327 --> 08:58.364
- Drive me to Shibuya.
- I can't.

08:58.607 --> 09:00.643
My date's waiting for me there.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.798
No. I have to wait for him.

09:04.207 --> 09:05.959
I'll go by cab then.

09:06.967 --> 09:09.117
Is Nishi's wife really dying?

09:09.287 --> 09:12.245
Damn it! Don't say that.
It's bad luck.

09:12.407 --> 09:15.479
- Leukemia, right?
- Why don't you shut up?

10:24.367 --> 10:25.846
Excuse me.

10:26.607 --> 10:29.201
The doctor wants to speak to you.

10:56.527 --> 10:59.963
Modern medicine
can't work miracles.

11:01.407 --> 11:03.443
We've done all we can.

11:04.687 --> 11:08.646
I think it would be better
to take her home.

11:09.807 --> 11:13.038
The child's death was a real blow.

11:14.287 --> 11:17.996
She'll be better off at home
than in the hospital.

11:29.687 --> 11:32.997
Excuse me. Could you call Mr. Nishi?

11:33.167 --> 11:34.520
Just a moment.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.318
Mr. Nishi, someone to see you.

11:51.567 --> 11:53.285
Det. Horibe's been shot.

12:38.167 --> 12:40.237
Even when they're married,

12:40.967 --> 12:43.401
people just think about themselves.

12:45.767 --> 12:47.917
When I came home,

12:48.087 --> 12:51.124
my wife and child
couldn't even look at me.

12:51.487 --> 12:53.603
The light wasn't even on.

12:54.287 --> 12:56.323
They just said goodbye.

12:58.047 --> 12:59.878
Now that I'm a wreck

13:00.047 --> 13:02.117
they leave me just like that.

13:02.887 --> 13:07.165
Actually, it may be better this way.

13:08.167 --> 13:10.203
But I've got nothing to do.

13:11.127 --> 13:15.518
My mom says I should
take up a hobby or something.

13:16.287 --> 13:17.959
Haiku.

13:18.407 --> 13:20.716
She wanted me to join
a poetry group.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.162
Give me a break.

13:23.647 --> 13:26.480
Work is all I've ever known.

13:29.207 --> 13:31.721
Since I live by the seaside,

13:32.127 --> 13:34.083
maybe I should try painting.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.363
But I've never painted anything.

13:36.967 --> 13:39.242
I wouldn't know where to start.

13:40.807 --> 13:43.275
And the materials don't come cheap.

13:47.047 --> 13:49.800
Don't get me wrong.
It's not your fault.

13:52.607 --> 13:54.837
Maybe I'll buy a beret.

15:22.927 --> 15:24.360
Don't worry.

15:24.527 --> 15:26.882
You're very kind.

15:28.367 --> 15:31.723
After all, my husband
died in the line of duty.

15:34.087 --> 15:38.399
Because of the recession,
good jobs are hard to come by,

15:40.287 --> 15:43.404
but I'm helping out at a deli.

15:44.927 --> 15:46.565
The hardest part is...

15:52.487 --> 15:57.197
when my son tells me
he misses his dad.

15:58.007 --> 15:59.156
It's so sad...

16:03.687 --> 16:06.759
But I'm sure he'll understand soon.

16:07.207 --> 16:08.845
We'll be OK.

16:14.367 --> 16:17.006
I have to get back to work.

16:46.047 --> 16:47.480
I've decided...

16:49.407 --> 16:51.284
to get married.

16:52.367 --> 16:53.720
Who to?

16:55.087 --> 16:57.078
I really wasn't serious about her,

16:57.447 --> 17:01.156
but when I was injured,
she visited me every day.

17:01.607 --> 17:03.404
I was touched by that.

17:10.207 --> 17:11.720
Can you answer that?

17:12.367 --> 17:13.880
Excuse me.

17:17.207 --> 17:18.925
Kudo speaking.

17:24.406 --> 17:26.045
The other day,

17:26.967 --> 17:29.356
I went to see Mr. Horibe.

17:33.167 --> 17:35.476
He seemed so lonely.

17:39.167 --> 17:41.920
They were
such a close-knit family...

17:42.087 --> 17:44.760
but his wife and child left him.

17:59.967 --> 18:03.880
You know,
you really shouldn't feel guilty...

18:06.847 --> 18:09.441
Tanaka's death
isn't your fault either.

18:11.207 --> 18:13.163
He died in the line of duty.

18:16.127 --> 18:18.038
It's nobody's fault.

18:54.847 --> 18:56.439
This way, please.

18:56.607 --> 18:58.040
Shut up!

19:08.447 --> 19:10.756
- Yes, sir?
- Shut up!

19:14.047 --> 19:15.480
Hey, Nishi.

19:16.607 --> 19:20.156
The boss is mad. You haven't paid
the interest this month.

19:20.967 --> 19:23.197
You better pay up!

19:24.447 --> 19:27.007
You know what we yakuza are like!

19:27.407 --> 19:29.318
After all, you were a cop.

19:29.487 --> 19:33.196
Without the badge,
he's just an ordinary guy.

19:33.367 --> 19:36.200
He's less than that - he's a bum.

22:09.967 --> 22:11.719
How's your wife?

22:14.967 --> 22:17.959
Here are her usual pills.

22:19.927 --> 22:22.441
But I don't think
they'll do her much good.

22:24.327 --> 22:27.319
Don't think about it too much.

22:27.687 --> 22:31.362
When you're with her,
talk to her as much as possible.

22:32.727 --> 22:36.800
You could even take her on a trip.

22:37.767 --> 22:40.327
If anything happens, call me.

22:44.127 --> 22:46.516
Here's a shirt for you.

22:46.687 --> 22:50.236
It might be too big for you,
but you can have it.

22:51.607 --> 22:53.598
Please try to be more careful.

23:47.047 --> 23:48.196
Hello.

24:15.127 --> 24:16.719
It's Horibe...

24:18.087 --> 24:20.203
He attempted suicide.

24:21.047 --> 24:23.607
Luckily his landlord found him.

24:23.767 --> 24:25.997
I think he'll make it,

24:26.367 --> 24:27.356
but he took

24:28.407 --> 24:30.557
a lot of sleeping pills.

24:39.927 --> 24:43.476
Are his wife and daughter there?

25:05.767 --> 25:07.917
He's asleep now.

25:08.087 --> 25:11.363
He should be OK
in a couple of days.

25:31.127 --> 25:32.685
Shall we go?

26:24.887 --> 26:27.242
- Let me out here.
- I'll take you home.

26:27.407 --> 26:29.159
It's OK. I'll get out.

26:30.487 --> 26:32.000
Stop the car.

26:52.407 --> 26:55.444
What sort of a detective
was Mr. Nishi?

26:56.287 --> 26:58.278
He was a great cop.

26:59.087 --> 27:01.396
Decorated lots of times.

27:04.367 --> 27:07.325
He and Mr. Horibe were a great team.

27:07.847 --> 27:11.999
Whenever Mr. Horibe got too rough,
Mr. Nishi would stop him.

27:20.367 --> 27:24.883
You haven't even paid back your debt
and you want another 4 million!

27:26.007 --> 27:30.000
Why should we lend it to you?
You can't even pay the interest.

27:30.167 --> 27:34.877
You poked my guy's eye out.
Who's going to pay for that?

27:35.087 --> 27:37.203
- Is that a loan, too?
- Forget it!

27:37.367 --> 27:40.359
If he can't pay us back,
he can work for us.

27:40.727 --> 27:42.558
What do you have in mind?

27:42.887 --> 27:45.242
He could be my bodyguard.

27:46.847 --> 27:48.678
Great idea!

27:49.047 --> 27:52.005
He keeps shooting
when the other guy's gun

27:52.167 --> 27:53.361
is empty.

27:55.807 --> 28:00.756
But when Mr. Nishi really lost it,
he was more frightening.

28:03.167 --> 28:04.839
Like that time...

28:06.007 --> 28:09.363
when he emptied his gun
into a corpse.

30:26.767 --> 30:28.200
Hello.

30:29.487 --> 30:30.886
How are you?

30:31.327 --> 30:33.238
Doing all right.

30:37.927 --> 30:39.997
Watch out, asshole!

30:40.167 --> 30:42.317
I had the right of way!

30:42.487 --> 30:44.842
On narrow roads,
big cars should yield!

30:45.007 --> 30:46.440
- Are you crazy?
- What?

30:46.607 --> 30:49.519
- Driving such a tiny car!
- What's it to you?

30:49.687 --> 30:51.996
- Fix it yourself.
- Mind your business!

30:52.207 --> 30:54.880
- Want some more?
- What?

30:55.047 --> 30:56.605
Well?

30:56.887 --> 30:58.479
I'm sorry.

30:58.647 --> 31:00.285
Are you done?

32:25.447 --> 32:28.086
- What's going on?
- He's in a coffee shop.

32:31.007 --> 32:34.716
He has a gun and with all
these people, we can't do a thing.

32:36.287 --> 32:37.276
How's Horibe?

32:37.447 --> 32:39.722
Don't know yet.
He's at the hospital.

32:39.887 --> 32:42.242
He got hit in the belly.

35:07.887 --> 35:09.684
What are you doing?

35:11.447 --> 35:13.563
Can you sell me that light?

35:14.607 --> 35:17.201
You mean the police light?

35:17.367 --> 35:18.880
What do you want it for?

35:19.207 --> 35:21.437
I'm thinking of robbing a bank.

35:27.407 --> 35:28.840
Sounds great!

35:29.007 --> 35:31.726
Take it. You can have it.

35:32.967 --> 35:34.525
Good luck.

35:42.647 --> 35:45.764
Do some work,
you glue-sniffing bum!

38:37.607 --> 38:39.643
You want 500,000 for this?

38:39.807 --> 38:41.320
No, not this one.

38:41.487 --> 38:42.886
The other one.

38:48.087 --> 38:49.406
What other one?

38:49.567 --> 38:51.000
This one.

38:53.727 --> 38:55.285
But it's a taxi cab!

38:55.567 --> 38:57.239
It's mine.

38:58.767 --> 39:00.086
How come?

39:00.327 --> 39:02.966
- It belongs to me.
- You didn't steal it?

39:03.127 --> 39:04.765
No, it's mine.

39:04.967 --> 39:07.117
- How old are you?
- 20.

39:07.287 --> 39:09.278
You can't get a cab license at 20!

39:10.327 --> 39:12.158
I'll call the cops!

40:01.407 --> 40:05.764
The fender's a bit dented,
but you can have it for 200,000.

40:06.407 --> 40:08.398
This car is hot.

40:09.647 --> 40:11.524
How about 50,000?

40:18.127 --> 40:20.197
What happened at the bar?

40:20.367 --> 40:22.927
Like I said, the waiter apologized

40:23.087 --> 40:26.159
for spilling soy sauce on my jacket.

40:26.327 --> 40:28.079
And gave you 100,000 yen!

40:28.967 --> 40:31.481
It was an Armani suit and...

40:31.647 --> 40:34.115
Armani? You're kidding!

40:34.287 --> 40:35.925
Genuine Armani.

40:37.407 --> 40:38.396
And?

40:38.567 --> 40:41.365
And I needed
some money for the taxi and...

40:41.527 --> 40:42.960
For the taxi?

40:43.127 --> 40:45.595
100,000 yen for the taxi! Where to?

40:45.767 --> 40:47.405
Oita, on the southern isle.

40:47.567 --> 40:49.558
Don't bullshit me.

40:51.167 --> 40:53.317
Do you take us for fools?

40:53.487 --> 40:56.559
- He offered it to me.
- That's extortion!

40:56.727 --> 40:57.955
Not at all.

40:58.127 --> 41:00.038
Cut the crap!

41:57.807 --> 41:59.763
I'll throw this in, too.

46:15.687 --> 46:16.403
Hi!

46:19.767 --> 46:21.962
Can I help you?

46:34.727 --> 46:38.003
METROPOLITAN POLICE

48:23.727 --> 48:27.003
You're just a yakuza loan shark!

48:27.407 --> 48:29.602
An expert at dirty tricks.

48:32.407 --> 48:36.241
You borrow money off me
and call me a loan shark!

48:36.407 --> 48:40.286
Well, aren't you? You don't
respect the terms of the contract.

48:40.447 --> 48:45.123
Your interest rate's outrageous.
You can wait a while!

48:46.247 --> 48:49.796
You've been saying that
for months, you bastard!

48:49.967 --> 48:52.003
We're running a business!

48:52.567 --> 48:54.797
You can't get blood from a stone.

48:56.487 --> 48:58.318
Want a bullet in your head?

48:59.007 --> 49:01.362
I dare you, you two-bit punk!

49:11.767 --> 49:13.120
Hey!

49:23.967 --> 49:25.366
What do you want, boy?

51:22.207 --> 51:24.926
Good luck with the bank robbery.

51:45.287 --> 51:46.606
Miss...

51:47.367 --> 51:49.722
I found it there. How much?

51:49.887 --> 51:51.957
You can have it. It's junk.

51:52.127 --> 51:55.324
Junk, huh? Is the rest junk, too?

52:08.287 --> 52:10.881
- What are you doing?
- Salvaging junk.

52:11.087 --> 52:12.566
What do you mean "junk"?

52:12.727 --> 52:14.206
Isn't this junk?

52:14.367 --> 52:16.597
It's merchandise, asshole!

52:17.767 --> 52:19.598
Hey, I recognize you!

55:11.847 --> 55:14.407
Hey! I've been hit!

55:14.727 --> 55:15.876
Hey, wait!

55:16.087 --> 55:17.918
Stupid cop, wait!

55:19.847 --> 55:22.839
I'm a hit-and-run victim!

55:23.007 --> 55:24.804
You waste of public money!

56:12.447 --> 56:14.756
I should've sold it for 200,000.

56:20.047 --> 56:22.038
Wake up!

56:36.647 --> 56:38.239
8 of hearts.

56:43.607 --> 56:45.438
4 of clubs.

56:51.407 --> 56:53.238
Queen of diamonds.

56:56.847 --> 56:58.599
10 of hearts.

57:03.367 --> 57:05.085
Ace of diamonds.

57:10.367 --> 57:12.483
Queen of clubs.

57:23.207 --> 57:24.879
Crunchy chocolate!

59:17.287 --> 59:18.197
Goodbye.

59:18.367 --> 59:20.085
Thank you very much.

59:36.967 --> 59:39.003
Why don't you keep it?

59:39.407 --> 59:42.046
I'm sure he wants you to.

59:51.847 --> 59:55.522
Mr. Nishi was really worried
about you.

59:58.527 --> 59:59.801
Goodbye.

01:00:38.247 --> 01:00:41.637
I can't believe it!
He paid back all his debts!

01:00:41.927 --> 01:00:43.918
Did he rob a bank?

01:00:44.087 --> 01:00:46.203
No, he wouldn't do that!

01:00:46.367 --> 01:00:48.323
Right. He's not like you!

01:00:48.487 --> 01:00:52.002
To make a fortune,
I'd play the stock market.

01:00:52.447 --> 01:00:54.915
- Extort companies?
- Don't use that word!

01:00:55.087 --> 01:00:57.237
The boss is a legit businessman.

01:00:57.407 --> 01:00:59.363
A businessman packing a piece!

01:01:49.687 --> 01:01:51.564
HANDLE WITH CARE

01:02:18.887 --> 01:02:20.320
Nobody home.

01:02:21.287 --> 01:02:23.323
Did you ask the neighbors?

01:02:23.807 --> 01:02:25.718
Go ask them, you fool!

01:06:17.447 --> 01:06:20.564
More! A bit more!

01:06:20.727 --> 01:06:22.365
More, I said!

01:08:22.407 --> 01:08:23.999
Look.

01:08:24.846 --> 01:08:27.407
What a big bell!

01:08:28.567 --> 01:08:30.636
Look at the size of it!

01:08:30.807 --> 01:08:35.243
It goes "gong" when you hit it.

01:08:38.846 --> 01:08:41.520
You can't hit it now.

01:08:41.846 --> 01:08:45.362
But you'll hear it this evening.

01:08:51.727 --> 01:08:54.799
Well, it's time to go home now.

01:09:53.087 --> 01:09:55.726
LUCKY CHARM

01:10:07.487 --> 01:10:09.876
All this free time is tough.

01:10:10.927 --> 01:10:13.760
I paint pictures to kill time,

01:10:14.207 --> 01:10:16.198
but I'm only an amateur.

01:10:16.647 --> 01:10:18.922
I can't find anything to paint.

01:10:26.607 --> 01:10:28.837
Hasn't Mr. Nishi been in touch?

01:10:29.287 --> 01:10:30.925
Not recently.

01:10:31.847 --> 01:10:34.964
But he sent me
some art materials a while ago.

01:10:35.127 --> 01:10:37.163
I didn't know what to say.

01:10:37.847 --> 01:10:40.566
With his wife sick,
he must be very busy.

01:10:49.207 --> 01:10:50.196
To be honest...

01:10:50.727 --> 01:10:53.605
I don't think
his wife has long to live.

01:10:54.207 --> 01:10:57.882
But in a way,
he's better off than me.

01:11:28.847 --> 01:11:31.202
What are you giving them water for?

01:11:32.527 --> 01:11:34.404
Those flowers are dead.

01:11:40.287 --> 01:11:44.917
Hey, it's no use
watering dead flowers!

01:11:45.447 --> 01:11:48.678
Did you get ditched by a guy
and lose your mind?

01:13:44.047 --> 01:13:45.605
I'll be right back.

01:14:27.007 --> 01:14:30.204
Boss says you forgot the interest.

01:14:53.887 --> 01:14:55.320
Hey!

01:15:09.887 --> 01:15:12.321
Go on, shoot me, punk.

01:15:13.007 --> 01:15:14.360
Go on.

01:15:20.007 --> 01:15:21.440
Open your mouth.

01:15:26.727 --> 01:15:28.638
Next time, I'll kill you.

01:16:53.887 --> 01:16:56.037
There! Italian-style cooking.

01:17:20.927 --> 01:17:22.360
Step on it!

01:17:22.607 --> 01:17:23.483
Go on!

01:17:24.367 --> 01:17:25.766
No. Forward!

01:17:26.807 --> 01:17:28.320
Forward!

01:17:38.447 --> 01:17:40.756
Why did you want to see the snow?

01:17:41.367 --> 01:17:43.198
It's freezing cold.

01:17:43.847 --> 01:17:46.122
You're going to catch a cold.

01:17:47.407 --> 01:17:49.079
My hand hurts.

01:18:03.087 --> 01:18:04.759
Can't you hold it?

01:18:06.647 --> 01:18:08.478
Go over there.

01:18:09.647 --> 01:18:11.603
Don't worry. I'll keep watch.

01:19:25.487 --> 01:19:27.557
Just you?

01:19:28.407 --> 01:19:30.523
Don't you want one
with your husband?

01:19:38.367 --> 01:19:39.322
Ready?

01:19:39.687 --> 01:19:40.517
Smile.

01:19:43.967 --> 01:19:45.161
Cheese!

01:19:50.607 --> 01:19:54.316
A souvenir for you.
Enjoy your stay.

01:20:19.887 --> 01:20:21.957
SNOW

01:20:28.847 --> 01:20:31.725
LIGHT

01:21:00.527 --> 01:21:03.041
SUICIDE

01:21:55.647 --> 01:21:57.285
Excuse me.

01:21:58.847 --> 01:22:02.157
There's someone to see you.

01:22:38.007 --> 01:22:39.201
What do you want?

01:22:39.367 --> 01:22:42.245
The boss is here. Come with me.

01:22:42.767 --> 01:22:45.486
- Where are we going?
- You'll find out.

01:22:46.367 --> 01:22:48.244
Come with me.

01:22:57.687 --> 01:22:59.200
Sorry about your eye.

01:24:05.327 --> 01:24:07.602
How much money do you have left?

01:24:08.327 --> 01:24:10.557
Why don't you hand the rest over
to us?

01:24:14.367 --> 01:24:16.961
After prison
you'll get it back with interest.

01:24:40.087 --> 01:24:42.555
I warned you.

01:25:41.687 --> 01:25:44.042
SUICIDE

01:27:41.487 --> 01:27:43.523
Shove him in and close the door.

01:29:36.207 --> 01:29:37.959
I saw them...

01:29:38.767 --> 01:29:40.359
the yakuza corpses...

01:29:48.687 --> 01:29:50.962
Can you wait a moment?

01:30:00.647 --> 01:30:02.558
Just a moment.

01:30:31.567 --> 01:30:34.400
I could never live like that.

01:32:38.567 --> 01:32:40.319
Thank you.

01:32:49.887 --> 01:32:51.684
