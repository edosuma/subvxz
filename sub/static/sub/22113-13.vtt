<i>Previously on The Last Man on Earth...</i>

00:02.501 --> 00:03.584
I want you to have a baby.

00:03.669 --> 00:06.148
- Let's do this.
- Whoa! Easy there.

00:06.167 --> 00:07.376
I'm not having a baby.

00:07.407 --> 00:10.408
There's a serious
biological impediment here.

00:10.459 --> 00:11.542
Not necessarily.

00:11.670 --> 00:14.571
We have a question for you.

00:20.044 --> 00:22.589
Um, oh, oh, okay.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.498
Um...

00:29.632 --> 00:31.465
Sorry. You know, I-I can't do it.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.992
- Then I'm gonna do it.
- No, I think I should do it.

00:34.017 --> 00:36.687
- Then do it.
- Okay, fine. God. Mm.

00:37.734 --> 00:39.462
(CLEARS THROAT)

00:39.565 --> 00:42.432
Okay, um, Erica...

00:43.769 --> 00:46.336
As-as you know, I, um...

00:46.438 --> 00:49.472
I-I real... really
want to have a child.

00:49.497 --> 00:50.919
Uh, very clear on that.

00:50.956 --> 00:53.453
Okay, great, and as you also know,

00:53.478 --> 00:58.187
Melissa does not want
to... h-have a child, so...

00:58.212 --> 00:59.845
Yeah, I don't.

00:59.870 --> 01:01.307
Clear on that, too.

01:01.332 --> 01:05.432
So, um, you already have a-a child.

01:05.456 --> 01:08.458
Is-is that fair to say?

01:08.560 --> 01:11.628
I think I feel comfortable
confirming that.

01:11.730 --> 01:14.431
And, uh, do-do you like your baby?

01:14.533 --> 01:17.300
Eh, I don't know. She's
all right, I guess.

01:17.402 --> 01:20.370
Oh. Oh. Oh.

01:20.395 --> 01:22.865
Oh, Todd, I'm kidding. I-I love her.

01:23.193 --> 01:24.674
Cool.

01:24.979 --> 01:27.680
It's very, very cool.

01:35.597 --> 01:37.213
Do you want to have a baby with Todd?

01:37.238 --> 01:39.689
- I'm sorry?
- TODD: Oh, we have our answer.

01:39.791 --> 01:42.355
You know, this was a fool's
errand, and I am a fool.

01:42.449 --> 01:43.693
Thank you very much, Erica.

01:43.795 --> 01:47.564
You've been nothing but gracious
throughout this entire ordeal.

01:47.666 --> 01:49.399
I-I didn't say "no."

01:49.501 --> 01:50.500
Oh. Oh, my God!

01:50.602 --> 01:52.435
I'm gonna be a dad! What?! Really?!

01:52.537 --> 01:55.372
Whoa, no. I mean, I... I
didn't say "yes," either.

01:55.474 --> 01:57.574
R-Real roller coaster
here, I got to tell you.

01:57.676 --> 02:01.207
Well, Todd, this is, like, a huge thing.

02:01.232 --> 02:03.680
Can I have a little bit
of time to think about it?

02:03.782 --> 02:05.248
Yeah. No.

02:05.350 --> 02:07.272
Of course. Of course. Absolutely.

02:07.297 --> 02:09.297
I mean, you-you take your time.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.721
Um, yeah.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.096
Todd?

02:17.121 --> 02:19.088
Is it a more than a
few minutes situation?

02:19.431 --> 02:21.431
More than a few minutes situation.

02:22.678 --> 02:24.300
(WHISPERING): We should go. Okay.

02:24.403 --> 02:26.369
Let's go.

02:34.207 --> 02:36.446
Oh. Who just got her bath?

02:36.471 --> 02:39.126
You did. You did.

02:39.212 --> 02:41.685
And who just did a huge poop?

02:41.787 --> 02:43.653
That's right. Daddy did.

02:43.755 --> 02:46.623
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

02:46.725 --> 02:48.525
Oh, hey, Care Bear.
Didn't see you there.

02:48.627 --> 02:51.594
Don't mind me. Just do
your thang. (CHUCKLES)

02:51.697 --> 02:53.730
You want Daddy to put you to bed?

02:53.832 --> 02:55.532
Huh? Huh?

02:55.634 --> 02:57.333
(GASPS SOFTLY)

02:57.436 --> 02:58.635
Stop right there.

02:59.417 --> 03:02.459

03:02.897 --> 03:05.272
Your lower back hair
is catching the light

03:05.303 --> 03:07.369
in the most beautiful way.

03:07.612 --> 03:10.647
It's like I'm seeing
it for the first time.

03:11.498 --> 03:14.098
Must be some residual push sweat.

03:14.155 --> 03:15.241
I don't know if you heard,

03:15.266 --> 03:17.676
but I just took a
pretty aggressive dump.

03:17.756 --> 03:19.723
I did hear.

03:19.825 --> 03:22.392
Whatever you're doing, keep doing it,

03:22.494 --> 03:24.402
'cause Mommy likey.

03:24.427 --> 03:26.594
Well, Daddy aimsy to pleasey.

03:33.792 --> 03:35.792
Slowly.

03:39.778 --> 03:42.445
Ooh.

03:43.042 --> 03:45.584
Stop right there.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.684
Now raise the baby.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.759
- Mmm.
- Yeah, that's right.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.627
Get lost in it.

03:57.729 --> 04:01.431
Why don't you come over here
and give me a little taste?

Ooh.

04:31.630 --> 04:34.397
- My compliments to the chef.
- Careful.

04:34.499 --> 04:36.399
I don't want to spoil your dinner.

04:36.424 --> 04:38.324
Lucky for you, I have a tapeworm,

04:38.349 --> 04:40.249
and he skipped lunch.

04:40.307 --> 04:41.704
- Oh, Carol.
- Tandy.

You just gave birth.

04:45.477 --> 04:47.477
I mean, isn't it too soon for sex?

04:47.883 --> 04:50.547
Well, just 'cause the
doggy door's busted

04:50.649 --> 04:53.449
doesn't mean we can't
look through the peep hole.

(BOTH MOANING)

(LAUGHS) A baby? You...
you said no, right?

05:02.794 --> 05:06.055
I didn't say anything. I was
too in shock to be honest.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.456
- Oh, you got to shut this down.
- Yeah, I-I know.

05:08.481 --> 05:10.211
I-I just... I feel bad.

05:10.250 --> 05:13.876
I mean, Dawn is the light
of my life, and by saying no,

05:13.918 --> 05:17.168
I'm denying Todd his only
chance at this experience.

05:17.242 --> 05:19.109
It's pretty cut and dry, Shug.

05:19.211 --> 05:23.446
"Aw, Todd, you're so sweet,
but no way in freaking hell,

05:23.548 --> 05:26.988
and my smoke-show of a
wife supports me in that."

05:27.013 --> 05:28.913
You're right. I got to be direct.

05:28.938 --> 05:31.608
I'll just pull him aside after dinner.

05:31.633 --> 05:33.788
Ugh. He's gonna be crushed.

05:33.813 --> 05:35.258
He knows it's a long shot.

05:35.360 --> 05:37.560
I'm sure he hadn't gotten his hopes up.

05:52.344 --> 05:54.077
Sorry we're late.

05:54.179 --> 05:57.280
Tandy and I were engaged in
a spirited petting session.

05:57.382 --> 05:59.416
- (CAROL AND TANDY CHUCKLE)
- MELISSA: Ugh.

05:59.518 --> 06:02.318
With outercourse like that,
who <i> needs</i> intercourse?

06:02.421 --> 06:05.121
JK. I do, and hopefully soon. (CHUCKLES)

06:05.223 --> 06:07.557
Todd, uh, please pass
the garbanzo beans.

06:10.490 --> 06:11.892
Todd?

06:11.917 --> 06:13.096
Oh. I'm-I'm sorry.

06:13.198 --> 06:14.917
- Here. Coming at you.
- (CAROL CHUCKLES)

06:15.542 --> 06:17.300
(WHISPERS): I'll get it.

06:19.371 --> 06:22.272
- What you thinking about, bud?
- Nothing! God!

06:22.297 --> 06:24.174
- Sorry. I'm-I'm...
- No.

06:24.209 --> 06:26.209
It's just, I-I wasn't thinking
about anything in particular.

06:26.311 --> 06:28.411
And I answered your question
to the best of my ability

06:28.513 --> 06:30.246
given the available
knowledge at the time.

06:30.348 --> 06:31.481
You were saying something interesting

06:31.584 --> 06:33.626
about garbanzo beans?

06:34.251 --> 06:36.352
You okay, bud?

06:37.040 --> 06:39.314
Uh, okay, you know, I'm just
gonna come out and say it.

06:39.424 --> 06:44.327
Melissa and I have asked
Erica to have my baby.

06:44.429 --> 06:45.428
- (CAROL GASPS)
- No way.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.163
That is so exciting! Oh!

06:47.265 --> 06:49.265
No, but, guys, please just
leave... no, leave her alone.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.167
She's taking some time
to-to think about it.

06:51.269 --> 06:52.335
Isn't that right?

06:54.639 --> 06:58.208
- Oh, my God, have you decided?
- Oh, uh...

06:58.310 --> 07:00.410
maybe we should talk about this later.

07:00.512 --> 07:02.845
Actually, um, later doesn't work for me.

07:02.870 --> 07:05.115
Uh, I'm-I'm real busy in
all my later time slots.

07:05.140 --> 07:07.040
Could you just tell me now?

07:07.065 --> 07:09.219
- In-in front of everyone?
- Oh, yeah.

07:09.321 --> 07:11.702
What was I thinking? W-We
should do this in the other room.

07:11.727 --> 07:13.456
- Come on.
- (SIGHS): Okay.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.291

- I don't really want to go.
- Please.

Oh, you have a bean in your beard.

07:31.243 --> 07:32.442
Oh, that's embarrassing. Where is it?

- Got it.

08:00.205 --> 08:02.105
(BOTH MOANING)

08:13.318 --> 08:15.351
So?

08:20.083 --> 08:21.476
CAROL: Mom.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.168
We need to ask you something.

08:24.270 --> 08:28.139
As you know, Tandy and I
recently had twin baby girls.

08:28.241 --> 08:30.107
Can we agree on that?

08:30.209 --> 08:32.009
- Yeah.
- And both births

08:32.125 --> 08:34.500
came via the traditional
birthing causeway.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.413
- The female vagina.
- Mm-hmm.

08:36.438 --> 08:38.270
Can we agree on that?

08:38.451 --> 08:40.914
Uh, yeah.

08:40.940 --> 08:43.039
As we alluded to at dinner,

08:43.159 --> 08:48.536
Tandy and I have begun dabbling
in the sensual arts again.

08:49.307 --> 08:52.429
(PANTING) And despite powerful,

08:52.459 --> 08:56.876
even violent urges on both sides,

08:56.956 --> 09:00.641
our liaisons have been
anything but <i> dangereux.</i>

09:00.666 --> 09:02.766
Could y'all just cut
to the chase, please?

09:02.791 --> 09:06.078
Gail, Carol and I would like
your medical blessing to pork.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.782
What has it been?

09:10.807 --> 09:14.608
Like, less than two weeks
since you gave birth?

09:14.836 --> 09:16.220
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:16.245 --> 09:19.179
Look, the normal waiting
time is four to six weeks.

09:19.358 --> 09:21.000
- (GROANS): Oh.
- No.

09:21.042 --> 09:24.376
But your birth experience
was anything but normal,

09:24.417 --> 09:27.823
so maybe your freak show
of a reproductive system

09:27.824 --> 09:28.823
can handle it.

09:29.186 --> 09:30.998
Mom, are you saying

09:31.042 --> 09:33.749
that Tandy can release the hounds?

09:33.750 --> 09:37.143
I will never say that,
and I would request

09:37.167 --> 09:39.918
that you never make me hear that again.

09:40.005 --> 09:43.206
But the answer I think
you're looking for is yes.

09:43.308 --> 09:45.074
- Oh, thanks, Mom!

fun stuff at the mall.

I got some board games, cat puzzle,

10:07.265 --> 10:09.032
uh, a couple joke books.

10:09.057 --> 10:11.277
- Doesn't that sound fun?
- No.

which I've ever been a part?

12:17.228 --> 12:19.295

- Oh.

Oh, no, table four says
the meat is undercooked.

- Throwing it back on the grill.
- Table six has a nut allergy.

12:46.970 --> 12:49.806
I know the whole "Erica
not having your baby" thing

12:49.834 --> 12:51.126

- Tandy.

13:07.111 --> 13:09.245
Can I talk to you?

13:11.049 --> 13:12.882
Stop talking to him about babies.

13:13.061 --> 13:14.961
That's the last thing
he needs right now.

- I...
- I've got this handled, okay?

13:20.992 --> 13:22.291

him. It's killing me.

15:04.644 --> 15:06.444
He hasn't mentioned babies in months.

Hey, thanks so much for joining me, bud.

15:48.346 --> 15:50.462

15:50.487 --> 15:51.622
the real reason I brought you here

15:51.724 --> 15:54.224
was not to help me
dispose of dirty diapers.

what I'm about to say
