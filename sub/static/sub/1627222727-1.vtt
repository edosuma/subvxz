01:13.073 --> 01:16.032
-

01:47.107 --> 01:49.109
-

02:35.285 --> 02:36.982
: Thank you
for making my Sonic your Sonic.

02:37.026 --> 02:38.897
My name is McKayla.
How can I help you tonight?

02:38.941 --> 02:41.857
I need a Footlong Cheese Coney
with mustard and onions,

02:41.900 --> 02:43.989
large Tots
and a large Cherry Limeade.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.218
:
We're on the road showing

02:55.262 --> 02:58.743
real people the stain-fighting
power of OxiClean.

02:58.787 --> 03:01.311
: Thank you, Lord, for
this and many other blessings.

03:01.355 --> 03:03.618
Please keep a watchful eye
over Ally.

03:03.661 --> 03:06.011
In Jesus' name. Amen.

03:06.055 --> 03:07.796
: Do you
know how annoying that is?

03:07.839 --> 03:09.841
Not to mention you could
blow out your eye that way.

03:42.744 --> 03:44.702
-MAN: Where you from?
-BILL: Stillwater.

03:44.746 --> 03:46.878
Who's the last drilling company
you worked for?

03:46.922 --> 03:49.968
-ITA.
-Why'd you quit?

03:50.012 --> 03:51.709
Operator dropped the rig.
We stacked.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.711
I got laid off six months ago.

03:53.755 --> 03:54.756
What are you doing now?

03:54.799 --> 03:56.714
I work construction.

03:56.758 --> 04:00.065
But it's been slow
since the rig's been down.

04:00.109 --> 04:03.199
I've been doing cleanup
after that tornado by Shawnee.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.766
Getting after it.

04:15.646 --> 04:16.952
Hey, Sharon.

04:16.995 --> 04:19.041
Let me finish this page.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.178
One more page.

04:26.222 --> 04:29.312
Thank you for this food and for
all that is good in this world.

04:29.356 --> 04:32.141
Keep Allison
in your watchful eye.

04:32.184 --> 04:34.230
-Amen.
-Amen.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.321
You get hired out yet?

04:40.889 --> 04:42.934
Had an interview this morning.

04:45.110 --> 04:48.244
Got a call from your mother
a few days ago.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.811
She moved to Tampa.

04:50.812 --> 04:52.422
She ask for money or some shit?

04:52.466 --> 04:53.423
No.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.686
She asked about you.

04:56.861 --> 04:58.341
You should call her sometime.

04:58.385 --> 05:01.344
I got enough
I'm dealing with here.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.827
Did you pick up
my car registration?

05:06.828 --> 05:08.090
Yeah.

05:08.133 --> 05:09.352
I got it at home.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.180
Spent all morning
waiting for it.

05:14.966 --> 05:16.794
Got it online.

05:16.838 --> 05:18.666
Everything's online.

05:18.709 --> 05:21.930
Can't get a real human being
if you try.

05:21.973 --> 05:24.324
Didn't stop them
from charging me $23.

05:24.367 --> 05:25.977
I'll pay it.

05:26.021 --> 05:27.979
That's not what I meant.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.677
I know.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.813
SHARON:
There's a bag of things

05:35.857 --> 05:37.902
by the front door
for you to take.

05:37.946 --> 05:40.775
And an envelope of photos
in on her desk.

05:40.818 --> 05:42.037
Those are important.

06:11.109 --> 06:12.763
WOMAN:
Okay, you have two stopovers,

06:12.807 --> 06:14.983
the first in Atlanta,
the second in Frankfurt.

06:15.026 --> 06:17.072
-You're at gate 22.
-Thank you.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.948
I just need
your signature please.

07:09.559 --> 07:12.301
-You are with us for two weeks?
-Yes, ma'am.

07:13.607 --> 07:15.260
Thanks.

07:15.304 --> 07:18.263
Here's your key. Room 156.

07:18.307 --> 07:20.309
Thank you, ma'am.

07:21.484 --> 07:23.225
Welcome back, Mr. Baker.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.315
Hey.

07:26.358 --> 07:28.404
-

07:31.276 --> 07:32.495
Oh, pardon.

07:32.539 --> 07:33.931
Merci.

07:56.388 --> 07:57.389
-

07:57.433 --> 07:59.087
Hey. Hey.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.958
Y'all mind keeping it down?
I'm trying to sleep.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.134
-The music.
-Hein?

08:03.178 --> 08:04.527
-

08:04.571 --> 08:06.268
-No-no English.
-

08:06.311 --> 08:07.574
-No speak English.
-

08:07.617 --> 08:08.966
Yeah, all right.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.141
Hey, good night.

08:17.975 --> 08:20.325
-

08:31.206 --> 08:33.556
-Bonjour.
-Baker.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.541
:
Salim, neuf.

09:01.584 --> 09:03.891
Moussa, dix.

09:04.979 --> 09:06.633
Baker, onze.

09:19.602 --> 09:21.038
Merci.

09:21.082 --> 09:23.432
-Hey, baby girl.
- Hey, Dad.

09:24.651 --> 09:26.696
You look good.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.698
:
Thanks.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.570
How was the flight?

09:30.613 --> 09:32.963
Okay.

09:33.007 --> 09:34.356
You doing all right?

09:34.399 --> 09:36.619
-I'm okay, yeah.
-Good.

09:37.968 --> 09:40.144
Good.
You got some laundry for me?

09:40.188 --> 09:41.624
Yeah. Some.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.365
I'll get it done.

09:46.542 --> 09:48.413
They gave us
two more visiting days.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.546
The next one's, uh, Friday,
2:00 p.m.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.592
How's Gram?

09:52.635 --> 09:53.723
She's good.

09:53.767 --> 09:56.204
Still got the oxygen tank.

09:56.247 --> 09:58.598
Still got plenty of opinions.

09:59.686 --> 10:02.123
Miss her.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.168
She bought you
everything you wanted.

10:04.212 --> 10:05.648
Uh, we got you a extra pair
of socks

10:05.692 --> 10:08.216
and, uh, good new pair
of sneakers.

10:09.217 --> 10:11.001
Thanks.

10:11.045 --> 10:14.178
Uh, Gram said that she was
giving you some photos for me.

10:14.222 --> 10:16.659
Ah, shit. I forgot them.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.269
Oh, just bring them next time.

10:18.313 --> 10:20.445
No, I mean I forgot them
at home in Stillwater.

10:20.489 --> 10:22.099
Sorry.

10:22.143 --> 10:23.579
Doesn't matter.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.451
I got you, uh, a Cowboys
sweatshirt at the airport.

10:26.495 --> 10:28.105
They're gonna be good
this year.

10:28.149 --> 10:31.543
They got this big ol' tight end
out of Guthrie.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.458
Takes about three guys
to bring him down.

10:33.502 --> 10:35.678
He gonna go pro for sure.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.333
Cool.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.205
You still working
at the library?

10:41.249 --> 10:42.685
No, I quit.

10:42.729 --> 10:45.645
Um, Dad, I need you
to do something.

10:47.603 --> 10:49.170
I need you
to get that to Leparq,

10:49.213 --> 10:50.650
make sure she reads it.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.173
-Okay?
-Wh-What is it?

10:52.216 --> 10:55.132
It's-it's a letter.
Just give it to her.

10:55.176 --> 10:57.395
-Yeah, yeah. -The-the address
is on the envelope, okay?

10:57.439 --> 10:58.788
Yeah, okay.

10:58.832 --> 11:00.616
But are you good?

11:00.660 --> 11:03.271
Dad, please.

11:03.314 --> 11:05.142
I'll do it today.

11:05.186 --> 11:06.535
I'll make sure she reads it.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.276
Okay.

11:10.234 --> 11:12.149
Mind if we pray a bit?

11:13.150 --> 11:14.804
Yeah, sure, Dad.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.373
Thank you, Lord,

11:18.416 --> 11:20.070
for bringing us together
on this blessed day and

11:20.114 --> 11:21.811
thank you for keeping
a watchful eye on Allison.

11:42.614 --> 11:45.356
Mr. Baker.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.315
I'm sorry you had to wait,
but MaÃ®tre Leparq

11:47.358 --> 11:49.752
is not coming back
to the office today.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.711
I'll come back tomorrow, then.
Thank you, ma'am.

11:51.754 --> 11:54.191
Mr. Baker,
she's in court all week.

11:54.235 --> 11:55.540
Why don't you give me
your letter

11:55.584 --> 11:57.238
and I will make sure
she gets it.

11:57.281 --> 11:58.718
Can't do that.
Thank you, ma'am.

11:58.761 --> 12:01.068
-As you wish.
-

12:08.423 --> 12:10.599
-Bonjour.
-Hey.

12:19.477 --> 12:20.609
You locked out?

12:22.132 --> 12:23.264
Quoi?

12:24.265 --> 12:25.701
Key. You got a key?

12:25.745 --> 12:27.442
Ah, euh, non.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.750
:
Come on, let's go get it.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.537
Come on.
I'm gonna get you a new key.

12:44.546 --> 12:45.808
GIRL:
Bell?

12:45.852 --> 12:47.244
BILL:
Bill.

12:47.288 --> 12:48.419
Beal?

12:48.463 --> 12:49.856
Closer.

12:49.899 --> 12:51.248
What's your name?

12:51.292 --> 12:53.424
-Hmm?
-You.

12:53.468 --> 12:54.469
Maya.

12:54.512 --> 12:56.863
Maya. Ah, that's nice.

12:58.299 --> 12:59.648
CÃ‡'est quoi?

12:59.691 --> 13:02.651
It's a tattoo.

13:02.694 --> 13:05.436
-Hmm?

13:06.786 --> 13:08.309
Oh, it's a eagle.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.701
-Eagle?
-Eagle.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.312
Bald eagle. America.

13:12.966 --> 13:15.490
Yeah, and I got a skull
with a knife going through it.

13:17.579 --> 13:18.710
-Merci.
-BILL: Thank you, ma'am.

13:21.365 --> 13:23.628
-MAN: Merci.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.543
-Thank you.
-

13:31.506 --> 13:35.684
Afternoon. I'm looking for, uh,
for that person, MaÃ®tre Leparq.

13:56.705 --> 13:58.533
Ms. Leparq?

13:59.708 --> 14:01.666
-Mr. Baker?
-Yes, ma'am.

14:01.710 --> 14:02.972
I just need a few minutes
of your time.

14:03.016 --> 14:05.670
Letter from my daughter.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.500
LEPARQ:
I'm sorry, Mr. Baker,

14:09.544 --> 14:12.416
but I cannot honor
your daughter's request.

14:12.460 --> 14:13.809
Why's that?

14:13.853 --> 14:17.291
Mr. Baker, a judge
will not reopen this case

14:17.334 --> 14:18.683
based on hearsay.

14:18.727 --> 14:20.381
This is not possible.

14:21.382 --> 14:22.731
Okay.

14:22.774 --> 14:26.343
We have exhausted
every possible legal action.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.519
This letter tells me
that your daughter

14:28.563 --> 14:30.782
has not accepted her sentence.

14:30.826 --> 14:31.871
And she must.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.698
Do you understand?

14:33.742 --> 14:34.961
Yes, ma'am.

14:35.004 --> 14:36.701
I must go.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.660
I have a full day.

14:38.703 --> 14:40.662
Can I get that letter back?

14:41.663 --> 14:42.882
As you wish.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.753
-Thank you.
-Mr. Baker,

14:44.796 --> 14:48.539
there's a time for hope and
there's a time for acceptance.

14:48.583 --> 14:52.717
The last thing you want to give
your daughter is false hope.

14:52.761 --> 14:54.937
That could make her situation
very dire.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.026
Do you understand?

14:57.070 --> 14:58.593
Yes, ma'am.

15:26.838 --> 15:27.927
Hello.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.581
Hey.

15:30.625 --> 15:33.584
Uh, thank you for helping
my daughter Maya yesterday.

15:33.628 --> 15:36.283
I was a little bit late
coming back.

15:36.326 --> 15:38.589
It's, uh, you know,
we're between apartments,

15:38.633 --> 15:41.592
and we don't have electricity
at our new place.

15:41.636 --> 15:42.767
So...

15:42.811 --> 15:44.813
Sorry, I...

15:44.856 --> 15:46.336
I don't speak English.

15:47.598 --> 15:49.470
Oh, yes.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.602
The balcony. Yeah.

15:51.646 --> 15:54.954
Um, well, my-my English
came back to me.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.434
Uh, I'm-I'm sorry
for the loud noise.

15:57.478 --> 15:59.045
It's because of
my girlfriend Nedjma.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.960
She's a bad influence on me.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.658
I'm, uh, Virginie.

16:03.701 --> 16:04.789
I'm Bill.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.400
Hello, Bill.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.445
You're in Marseille
for vacation?

16:08.489 --> 16:10.491
Uh, visiting my daughter.

16:10.534 --> 16:11.666
It's cool.

16:13.233 --> 16:15.104
Well, hopefully we're only here
for one or two more days,

16:15.148 --> 16:17.802
but if you need anything,
you know, we're next door.

16:17.846 --> 16:19.500
Thank you, ma'am.

16:19.543 --> 16:21.589
Thank you. Bye, Bill.

16:27.508 --> 16:29.814
VIRGINIE:
"Dear MaÃ®tre Leparq,

16:29.858 --> 16:33.862
"I'm writing to you
because I was contacted by

16:33.905 --> 16:36.604
"Dr. Patrick Okonedo,

16:36.647 --> 16:38.998
"uh, chief of
the outreach program

"I was involved in
at university.

16:42.653 --> 16:45.047
"Patrick was approached
by a student

"who met a guy named Akim
at a party.

16:49.008 --> 16:53.360
"She was told he had
stabbed a girl years ago

16:53.403 --> 16:55.753
"and got away with it.

16:56.972 --> 17:01.498
It must be the same Akim
who killed Lina."

17:03.805 --> 17:07.722
You're the father of the girl,
the-the American student?

17:08.723 --> 17:10.464
Yes, ma'am.

17:14.816 --> 17:15.904
Um...

17:15.946 --> 17:18.602

17:18.646 --> 17:21.518
"to the unknown DNA

17:43.192 --> 17:46.717
"He's not capable.

17:46.761 --> 17:51.113
"Please do not abandon me
in this horrible place.

17:51.157 --> 17:53.115
"I have lost five years
of my life,

17:53.159 --> 17:56.118
"and I still have four to go.

17:56.162 --> 17:59.513
Sincerely, Allison Baker."

18:01.819 --> 18:02.864
I'm sorry.

18:02.907 --> 18:04.953
Appreciate your help.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.963
Please don't say anything
to anybody about this.

18:15.006 --> 18:17.183
Oui, bien sÃ»r.

18:26.844 --> 18:28.890
Mr. Baker. Please, this way.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.678
So, how can I help you?

18:35.679 --> 18:37.942
Well, I want to see Mrs. Leparq
about the case.

18:37.986 --> 18:40.119
MaÃ®tre Leparq
is not available today.

18:42.686 --> 18:45.733
There's a new lead.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.517
This guy...

18:47.561 --> 18:50.041
was talking at a party
about the murder.

18:50.085 --> 18:52.174
-Mr. Baker... -So somebody
needs to talk to this teacher,

18:52.218 --> 18:53.784
this guy, Patrick Okonedo.

18:53.828 --> 18:55.743
We need to hear
what he has to say.

18:55.786 --> 18:59.964
Mr. Baker, MaÃ®tre Leparq was
very clear with you yesterday.

19:00.008 --> 19:01.792
She cannot pursue this case.

19:01.836 --> 19:04.795
But if you wish to pursue
a further investigation,

19:04.839 --> 19:07.624
we can recommend this.

19:07.668 --> 19:10.018
It's a list of private
detectives you can engage.

19:10.061 --> 19:11.802
No, I don't want,
I don't want a detective.

19:11.846 --> 19:13.804
We have worked with
the people on this list,

19:13.848 --> 19:15.284
and they're all very capable.

19:15.328 --> 19:17.199
I don't care how capable
they are. I don't want...

19:17.243 --> 19:19.636
-I'm circling the names that
you can... -Stop circling that.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.986
-My daughter's in fucking jail.
-

19:22.030 --> 19:23.945
I don't need some fucking list.

19:24.946 --> 19:26.513
Euh, Ã§a va?

19:27.340 --> 19:29.124
Oui, oui, Ã§a va, oui.

19:30.343 --> 19:31.996
Merci.

19:35.696 --> 19:37.176
As you want.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.874
Fuck this.

19:57.805 --> 19:59.198
Merci, Sybille.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.938
-Hey. Mm.
-Hi.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.028
-You good?
-Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

20:04.072 --> 20:06.248
Let you out a bit late today.
They shouldn't do that.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.250
You know they're gonna
call you back in on time.

20:08.294 --> 20:10.209
It's okay.
It happens sometimes.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.211
-I did your laundry.
-Thanks.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.691
Um, did you give
my letter to Leparq?

20:14.735 --> 20:16.780
Yeah, of course.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.305
And what'd she say?

20:20.306 --> 20:25.049
Well, uh, she told me
what you wrote about Akim

20:25.093 --> 20:27.704
-and the girl at the party.
-And what'd she say?

20:27.748 --> 20:29.358
Well, she said, you know,

20:29.402 --> 20:31.969
she works on
a lot of these cases...

20:32.013 --> 20:33.971
Dad.

20:34.015 --> 20:37.061
Is she gonna
investigate it or not?

20:37.105 --> 20:39.107
Just tell me.

20:40.761 --> 20:42.589
Yeah, she's gonna look into it.

20:42.632 --> 20:44.243
Really?

20:45.940 --> 20:47.246
She said that?

20:47.289 --> 20:49.073
She said
she's gonna look into it?

20:49.117 --> 20:50.988
That's right.

20:51.032 --> 20:53.164
I told her how strongly
you felt about it.

20:53.208 --> 20:55.602
Does she need me
to do anything?

20:55.645 --> 20:59.780
No. She said she just needs
some time, and, uh...

20:59.823 --> 21:03.262
She did say, uh, she didn't
want to make any promises.

21:03.305 --> 21:06.308
She-she didn't want
to give you any false hope

21:06.352 --> 21:07.831
-or nothing like that.
-No, no, no, no, no.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.833
But that's-that's still great.

21:09.877 --> 21:11.835
Akim exists.

21:11.879 --> 21:13.402
He killed Lina.

21:13.446 --> 21:14.795
I know.

21:14.838 --> 21:16.753
-I know that.
-

21:16.797 --> 21:18.233
You have no idea how many times

21:18.277 --> 21:20.191
I-I wrote and then rewrote
that letter.

21:20.235 --> 21:21.410
:
Oh, my God.

21:21.454 --> 21:23.107
Well, it worked.

21:23.151 --> 21:24.892
:
Yeah.

21:24.935 --> 21:26.981
Maybe God answered our prayers.

21:27.024 --> 21:28.852
Thank you, Dad.

21:28.896 --> 21:31.159
Thank you so much.

21:47.088 --> 21:48.350
Excuse me, ma'am.

21:48.394 --> 21:51.222
Bill Baker.
Called about a list.

21:51.266 --> 21:53.181
One moment please.

21:53.224 --> 21:55.096
BILL: I don't know
how much you remember

21:55.139 --> 21:57.794
about the case, but
Allison came here for college,

21:57.838 --> 22:00.188
and that's where
she met this girl, Lina.

22:00.231 --> 22:02.408
Allison and Lina were...
together,

22:02.451 --> 22:04.801
and one night
they got in a big fight,

22:04.845 --> 22:06.803
and Allison went to a bar.

22:06.847 --> 22:09.371
That's where she met
this Akim guy.

22:09.415 --> 22:10.851
And they had some drinks.

22:10.894 --> 22:13.332
He stole her purse, and...

22:13.375 --> 22:15.377
when Allison got home,
she found Lina dead

22:15.421 --> 22:17.248
and called the police.

22:17.292 --> 22:19.207
And they never could find
this Akim.

22:19.250 --> 22:21.775
He's the one who killed Lina.

22:22.732 --> 22:24.865
What do you think?

22:27.041 --> 22:28.434
Mm-hmm.

22:29.435 --> 22:31.350
You speak English, right?

22:32.394 --> 22:33.743
English?

22:33.787 --> 22:35.702
Yes. I am.

22:36.485 --> 22:38.052
:
Fuck.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.316
Give me back the letter.

22:58.159 --> 23:00.074
:
Mr. Baker.

23:01.031 --> 23:03.251
Please.

23:03.294 --> 23:05.166
My office.

23:05.209 --> 23:09.083
I was in service
at the time of this case.

23:09.126 --> 23:11.172
In the police.

23:11.215 --> 23:13.479
Have you talked
to this Okonedo?

23:13.522 --> 23:16.046
-The professor.
-No, sir.

23:17.483 --> 23:20.877
I see why your lawyer
doesn't want to help.

23:20.921 --> 23:24.185
Some kid at a party
hears gossip about a murder.

23:24.228 --> 23:26.405
Maybe she remembers
this famous case.

23:26.448 --> 23:29.233
Why now? It was five years ago.

23:29.277 --> 23:33.020
That's... that's how long my
kid's been in jail, five years.

23:34.325 --> 23:36.458
Does she know we are meeting?

23:36.502 --> 23:37.894
Your kid.

23:37.938 --> 23:39.374
No, sir.

23:45.467 --> 23:47.426
Are you rich, Mr. Baker?

23:48.470 --> 23:49.819
No, sir.

23:49.863 --> 23:52.474
This is a DNA case.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.302
It means two steps.

23:54.345 --> 23:57.218
First, I look for
the young man.

23:57.261 --> 23:59.002
That will not be easy.

23:59.046 --> 24:02.223
People will talk.
He will try to disappear.

24:02.266 --> 24:05.313
Then, if I find this Akim,

24:05.356 --> 24:07.489
I have to get
a sample of his DNA

24:07.533 --> 24:10.927
and use my connections
in the police to test it

24:10.971 --> 24:13.321
against the DNA
from the crime scene.

24:14.322 --> 24:16.237
How much?

24:23.549 --> 24:25.899
$12,000?

24:25.942 --> 24:27.814
Euros.

24:30.251 --> 24:32.296
Thank you for your time.

24:33.341 --> 24:35.299
Mr. Baker.

24:35.343 --> 24:38.172
Do you believe
your daughter is innocent?

24:38.215 --> 24:40.174
I know she is.

24:41.915 --> 24:45.048
Then maybe it's not so much
to see her go free.

25:30.485 --> 25:32.574
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-Yes?

25:32.618 --> 25:35.185
-Ask you a question, please?
-Yes, of course.

25:35.229 --> 25:38.319
I'm just too much of a dumbass
to figure this out on my own.

25:38.362 --> 25:39.581
I don't speak French.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.975
Uh, how can I help you?

25:42.018 --> 25:43.367
I'm looking for a guy,

25:43.411 --> 25:45.413
uh, who works here.

26:01.429 --> 26:03.605
-Oui?
-Sorry to interrupt.

26:05.302 --> 26:06.434
Do you speak English?

26:09.219 --> 26:11.482
I do.

26:11.526 --> 26:13.441
Looking for Patrick Okonedo.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.358
-Have a seat please.

26:17.401 --> 26:18.707
That's all right.
I'll wait outside.

26:18.751 --> 26:21.623
No, no, please. Join the party.

26:37.421 --> 26:38.640
It's impressive, huh?

26:41.556 --> 26:44.080
It's the kind of office
a PhD will get you.

26:44.124 --> 26:45.952
Mint tea.

26:47.693 --> 26:50.086
I want to talk to the girl
you told Allison about

26:50.130 --> 26:51.261
from the party.

26:51.305 --> 26:53.524
Yes. I assumed as much.

26:54.656 --> 26:57.267
To be honest, I've always felt
guilty about what happened.

26:57.311 --> 26:59.269
I should've warned Allison.

26:59.313 --> 27:01.184
Warned her? About what?

27:01.228 --> 27:03.360
Well, I knew Allison and Lina
were sleeping together,

27:03.404 --> 27:06.537
but I had no idea
Lina had moved in with her.

27:06.581 --> 27:10.324
I try to not be cynical about
these type of relationships--

27:10.367 --> 27:12.413
poor girl from the ghetto,
rich American student--

27:12.456 --> 27:14.589
but then I end up
being guilty of naivete.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.112
Allison grew up poor.

27:16.156 --> 27:17.418
She isn't rich.

27:17.461 --> 27:19.594
Educated.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.466
There is a lot of resentments
towards the cultural elite.

27:22.510 --> 27:24.251
But I'm sure
you're aware of that.

27:25.556 --> 27:27.515
What about the girl
from the party?

27:27.558 --> 27:28.777
-My student?
-Yeah.

27:28.821 --> 27:30.692
Her name is Souad.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.346
She's from
the outreach program,

27:32.389 --> 27:33.608
the same one Lina and Allison

27:33.652 --> 27:35.305
were involved with
when they met.

27:35.349 --> 27:37.656
And she heard some guy
talking about Lina's murder?

27:37.699 --> 27:40.441
This is what she told me.

27:40.484 --> 27:42.312
Could I talk to her?

27:42.356 --> 27:44.010
She'll talk to you, yes.

27:44.053 --> 27:46.490
I'll give you her phone number.

27:47.491 --> 27:50.669
Souad doesn't speak English
very well.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.322
You will need someone
to translate.

27:52.366 --> 27:55.108
Oh, could you do that for me?

27:56.109 --> 27:57.676
No, I'd rather not.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.201
I'm still running
the outreach program.

28:01.244 --> 28:02.681
I cannot be associated with you.

28:02.724 --> 28:05.684
Or your daughter,
after what happened.

28:05.727 --> 28:07.555
Whatever my personal opinion
may be.

28:08.556 --> 28:10.297
My daughter's innocent.

28:15.215 --> 28:17.478
I wish you good luck.

28:17.521 --> 28:19.567
-

28:28.271 --> 28:31.100
BILL: Hey, Patricia,
afraid I need some help again.

28:31.144 --> 28:34.103
I'm supposed to attend a
very special birthday tomorrow,

28:34.147 --> 28:35.757
and I lost the address.

28:53.862 --> 28:55.559
:
Bonjour?

28:55.603 --> 28:56.822
BILL:
Hi. It's Bill Baker.

28:56.865 --> 28:58.780
Pardon?

28:58.824 --> 29:01.783
-Bill, from the hotel.
-Ah, Bill.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.393
Yeah, I was stopping by.
Sorry to...

29:04.612 --> 29:06.788
-Uh, last floor.
-All right.

29:09.704 --> 29:11.619
Hi, Bill.

29:11.662 --> 29:13.795
Hey, Maya.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.579
I got something for you.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.581
It's a robot.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.721
-Hi.
-Hi. Sorry to intrude.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.462
No, it's okay. Come in.

29:29.463 --> 29:31.552
Um, I have some friends over.

29:31.595 --> 29:33.249
Oh.

29:33.293 --> 29:34.773
How did you find us?

29:34.816 --> 29:36.775
Oh, the lady at reception
gave me your address

29:36.818 --> 29:38.559
'cause there's this girl
I need to call,

29:38.602 --> 29:41.823
but she don't speak English,
and it's kind of personal.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.825
Ah, you want me to make the
call for you. Is that right?

29:43.869 --> 29:45.261
Yes, ma'am, but I'll come back
another time.

29:45.305 --> 29:47.133
No, it's fine.
Uh, just come in.

29:47.176 --> 29:48.830
Just let me grab my phone.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.484
Come.

29:53.661 --> 29:54.793
-Hey.

29:54.836 --> 29:56.707
VIRGINIE:
Bill, this is, uh,

29:56.751 --> 29:59.406
the crÃ¨me de la crme
of the Marseille theater scene.

30:03.627 --> 30:04.715
VIRGINIE:
Ouais.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.632
Uh, we're doing
this, uh, mask exercise.

30:08.676 --> 30:09.808
-All right.
-Yeah.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.593
Excuse the mess.

30:12.636 --> 30:14.334
This is going to be my office,
but we're still moving in.

30:14.377 --> 30:16.205
Have a seat.

30:16.249 --> 30:17.554
So, who am I calling?

30:17.598 --> 30:19.295
Um...

30:19.339 --> 30:21.254
the girl from the letter.

30:21.297 --> 30:23.865
-Ah, it's about the case?
-Yes, ma'am.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.606
I want to meet with her.

30:25.649 --> 30:27.869
Is the lawyer not helping you?

30:27.913 --> 30:30.872
Uh, doing it myself for now.

30:30.916 --> 30:32.874
Oh. Wow.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.354
Okay. Um...

30:36.530 --> 30:39.185
-Oui.
-Um...

30:45.539 --> 30:46.975
What a great deal,
I got this place

30:47.019 --> 30:49.456
through this friend of mine.

30:49.499 --> 30:53.286
I fell in love with this view,
but, uh, has a few defects.

30:54.330 --> 30:55.810
Probably just
a circuit breaker.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.420
I could look at it if you want.

30:57.464 --> 30:59.945
-Yeah. You know how to do that?
-Yes, ma'am.

30:59.988 --> 31:02.338
Well, that would be great.

31:02.382 --> 31:04.471
Souad? Souad?

31:04.514 --> 31:06.212
Oui, bonjour. Souad?

31:06.255 --> 31:07.213
Bonjour.

31:10.912 --> 31:12.522
...Bill Baker.

31:12.566 --> 31:14.437
Bill Baker...

31:14.481 --> 31:16.222
Oh, non.

31:19.790 --> 31:21.705
Let me see. Let me see.

31:25.492 --> 31:27.537
Hey
-Cool.

31:27.581 --> 31:29.626
Sexy lady...
-

31:31.890 --> 31:33.892
I didn't know it did that.

31:41.464 --> 31:44.554
That-that goes on easy.
Hold on. There you go.

31:44.598 --> 31:45.947
Looks good.

31:47.688 --> 31:48.907
VIRGINIE:
Merci beaucoup.

31:48.950 --> 31:51.039
Au revoir.

31:51.083 --> 31:54.608
Okay. She agrees to see you
tomorrow at 6:00.

31:54.651 --> 31:56.566
All right.

31:56.610 --> 31:58.394
Um, she was nice.

31:58.438 --> 32:00.266
Bit shy.

32:00.309 --> 32:02.268
So how are you gonna talk to
her if you don't speak French?

32:03.095 --> 32:04.923
Well, that's a fair question.

32:04.966 --> 32:06.968
I'll figure it out.

32:07.012 --> 32:08.578
Okay.

32:08.622 --> 32:10.580
Well, I could come
and translate if you need.

32:10.624 --> 32:12.452
You sure?

32:12.495 --> 32:14.584
Uh, yeah.

32:14.628 --> 32:17.848
Yeah, Maya has art class,
so if you come here at 5:30,

32:17.892 --> 32:19.502
then we take my car.

32:20.503 --> 32:21.852
Appreciate it.

32:21.896 --> 32:23.289
Uh, you show me
where that fuse box is,

32:23.332 --> 32:24.507
I'll work on
that breaker for you.

32:24.551 --> 32:26.292
No, it's okay.

32:26.335 --> 32:27.684
You don't have to do that.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.382
Oh, non, non.

32:30.426 --> 32:32.776
Just give me that damn thing.
I-- Come on.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.478
MAYA:
Bill!

32:40.349 --> 32:42.351
Bye, Bill!

32:43.962 --> 32:45.485
Bye.

32:55.451 --> 32:57.801
VIRGINIE: I have to confess,
uh, I went online and I read

32:57.845 --> 32:59.673
about Allison's case.

32:59.716 --> 33:01.805
It was a big story at the time.

33:01.849 --> 33:04.895
I mean, the-the press
was ferocious, no?

33:04.939 --> 33:07.942
Y-You say "f-ferocious"?

33:07.986 --> 33:10.727
-Yes, ma'am, we say that.
-Yeah?

33:10.771 --> 33:13.382
-Putain.

33:13.426 --> 33:14.993
Dumbass.

33:15.036 --> 33:16.777
Yeah, people--
they don't know how to drive

33:16.820 --> 33:18.083
in this fucking town.

33:18.126 --> 33:20.346
It's a crazy place, Marseille.

33:20.389 --> 33:22.130
But I still prefer it to Paris.

33:22.174 --> 33:25.394
You know, people actually
talk to each other here.

33:25.438 --> 33:27.483
And plus, it's cheaper.

33:29.137 --> 33:31.096
And why did Allison
come here for school?

33:31.139 --> 33:32.575
I'm curious.

33:32.619 --> 33:34.969
-Don't know.
-No?

33:35.013 --> 33:37.015
Yeah, she was going
to Oklahoma State.

33:37.058 --> 33:38.973
She just called me up
one day, said,

33:39.017 --> 33:41.019
"I'm going to France," to here.

33:42.063 --> 33:43.760
She's independent.

33:43.804 --> 33:46.502
Yes, ma'am. Always been.

33:46.546 --> 33:47.721
Are you close?

33:48.896 --> 33:50.637
Well, you read her letter.

33:51.855 --> 33:53.857
And where is her mother?

33:53.901 --> 33:55.685
She passed.

33:55.729 --> 33:57.035
Killed herself.

34:00.647 --> 34:02.605
Allison was raised
by her grandmother mostly.

34:02.649 --> 34:04.042
I wasn't around much.

34:04.085 --> 34:05.521
Where were you?

34:05.565 --> 34:08.784
Working oil rigs and...

34:08.829 --> 34:10.831
being a fuckup when I wasn't.

34:12.746 --> 34:14.791
It's not easy
being a single parent.

34:14.835 --> 34:17.446
I often work at night, and
Maya, she gets really upset.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.708
-What do you do?
-I'm an actress.

34:19.753 --> 34:21.797
-Oh, on TV?
-No.

34:21.842 --> 34:23.887
Theater.

34:23.931 --> 34:25.541
Do you go to theater?

34:25.585 --> 34:27.717
No, ma'am.

34:27.761 --> 34:29.893
-Never?
-No, ma'am.

34:31.808 --> 34:33.418
Okay.

34:38.815 --> 34:40.774
BILL: Uh, thank y'all
for talking to me.

34:42.210 --> 34:45.126
So, this guy that she met
at the party, Akim--

34:45.170 --> 34:48.650
uh, anything she could
tell us about him?

34:55.702 --> 34:58.139
She said he was quiet and nice.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.619
Nice?

35:04.232 --> 35:06.582
And then he told her friend
he'd stabbed a girl

35:06.626 --> 35:08.932
and that the police
never caught him.

35:08.976 --> 35:10.760
-So...
-BILL: Okay.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.458
Does she know where he lives?

35:18.290 --> 35:20.161
BILL:
Does she know where he lives?

35:23.164 --> 35:25.645
-AÃ€ Kalliste.
-Kalliste?

35:25.688 --> 35:27.821
VIRGINIE: She says he lives
in a different project.

35:27.864 --> 35:29.605
It's called Kalliste.

35:41.661 --> 35:43.141
-BILL: What's she saying?
-Nothing helpful.

35:44.185 --> 35:47.623
I-I'm, uh... le pÃ¨re.

35:47.667 --> 35:50.060
Uh, Allison.

35:50.104 --> 35:51.975
That's my little girl.

35:52.019 --> 35:54.021
Allison is my... ma fille.

35:54.064 --> 35:56.110
You understand?

36:03.683 --> 36:05.902
She doesn't want to help.

36:05.946 --> 36:07.904
Can she tell me anything?

36:07.948 --> 36:09.602
Wh-What does this guy
look like?

36:17.175 --> 36:18.872
-Where they going?
-They're leaving.

36:18.915 --> 36:20.787
Uh, no, no, no. Hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

36:20.830 --> 36:23.181
Wait, no, no. Hold on.
Just wait. No, no.

36:23.224 --> 36:24.312
-All right, all right.
-Wouah, wouah, wouah! Wouah!

36:24.356 --> 36:26.923
Souad. Hey, Souad! Souad!

36:26.967 --> 36:28.795
Bill, Bill, let them go, okay?
She's afraid.

36:28.838 --> 36:30.231
Afraid of what?
I'm talking to her.

36:30.275 --> 36:31.928
Yeah, but that's not
how it works here.

36:31.972 --> 36:33.539
Well, you tell me
how it works then,

36:33.582 --> 36:34.888
'cause nobody here's
doing shit for me.

36:34.931 --> 36:36.977
VIRGINIE:
I do shit for you, okay?

36:37.020 --> 36:40.154
We should go. Now.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.200
Okay?

36:43.201 --> 36:44.854
-Yeah, all right.
-All right?

36:53.254 --> 36:56.083
VIRGINIE:
That's it. Kalliste.

36:56.126 --> 36:58.085
That's where she says
Akim lives.

36:58.128 --> 36:59.913
Well, can we go look around?

36:59.956 --> 37:01.610
No. Not at this time.

37:01.654 --> 37:04.222
It's not safe for us.

37:04.265 --> 37:05.832
'Cause we're white?

37:07.834 --> 37:10.010
'Cause we're not from there.

37:10.053 --> 37:12.230
And there's a lot of dealing.

37:12.273 --> 37:14.057
Well, I got to do something.

37:14.101 --> 37:16.234
No one will talk to you,
trust me.

37:17.974 --> 37:20.890
Bill, what if there's no Akim?

37:20.934 --> 37:22.892
There is.

37:22.936 --> 37:24.981
Okay, but they never
found this person

37:25.025 --> 37:26.766
during the investigation.

37:26.809 --> 37:28.289
My daughter's not a liar.

37:28.333 --> 37:29.899
No, I didn't say she was.

37:29.943 --> 37:31.336
It's just that everything
I read about the case...

37:31.379 --> 37:33.599
So you're some kind
of expert now?

37:35.383 --> 37:37.037
No, I'm not.

37:41.694 --> 37:43.609
The press was against us.

37:44.784 --> 37:46.699
All they cared about was

37:46.742 --> 37:49.136
Allison was sleeping
with some Arab girl.

37:50.180 --> 37:51.921
Bunch of...

37:51.965 --> 37:53.662
fake news scumbags.

37:55.142 --> 37:57.187
That's why you punched
that English reporter?

37:59.842 --> 38:02.062
I was drinking then.

38:11.985 --> 38:14.117
ALLISON: Hey, did you
tell Gram about Leparq?

38:14.161 --> 38:15.989
No.

38:16.032 --> 38:19.297
No, I didn't want to get her
hopes up until we know more.

38:19.340 --> 38:21.299
She's getting on,
your grandmother.

38:23.039 --> 38:25.303
Oh, I had a meeting
with the judge yesterday.

38:26.347 --> 38:28.306
Oh, yeah? About what?

38:28.349 --> 38:29.829
Well, I have my parole review

38:29.872 --> 38:31.874
coming up
in about three months.

38:31.918 --> 38:34.050
And, uh, it's the thing
where I get out of here

38:34.094 --> 38:35.051
one day a month.

38:35.095 --> 38:36.444
Yeah, okay.

38:36.488 --> 38:39.099
-So what'd he say?
-She. She said.

38:39.142 --> 38:42.972
Uh, you know, as long as
my behavior remained good,

38:43.016 --> 38:44.452
shouldn't be a problem.

38:44.496 --> 38:47.760
I felt like saying,
"Fuck parole.

38:47.803 --> 38:49.805
My lawyer's working on getting
me out of here for good."

38:49.849 --> 38:51.416
No, we don't know that yet,
Ally.

38:51.459 --> 38:53.809
-You got to keep...
-I know, I know, I know, Dad.

38:53.853 --> 38:56.986
I-I didn't say that.
But I wanted to.

38:57.030 --> 39:00.033
And... somebody from
Leparq's office was there.

39:01.034 --> 39:02.470
Oh, yeah?

39:02.514 --> 39:05.212
Yeah. I never met her,
but I asked her

39:05.255 --> 39:07.301
how the investigation was going.

39:08.258 --> 39:09.825
What'd she tell you?

39:09.869 --> 39:11.697
She said she didn't know
anything about it,

39:11.740 --> 39:14.047
but she also said
she just started working there.

39:15.048 --> 39:16.876
Leparq's probably
taking care of it herself.

39:16.919 --> 39:18.356
It's a big case.

39:18.399 --> 39:19.835
:
Yeah.

39:19.879 --> 39:21.837
I told her I wanted
to talk to Leparq.

39:21.881 --> 39:23.361
She should be
keeping us informed.

39:23.404 --> 39:25.319
-You know what I mean?
-I'll talk to her.

39:27.974 --> 39:30.933
Okay. Well...

39:30.977 --> 39:32.718
I'll see you in a couple days.

39:32.761 --> 39:34.763
Uh, Dad, do you think that
you could stay in Marseille

39:34.807 --> 39:36.199
a little longer?

39:36.243 --> 39:37.940
Just in case
something comes up.

39:38.941 --> 39:40.160
Yeah, I could do that.

39:40.203 --> 39:43.206
I'll check in on work
and stuff.

39:44.947 --> 39:46.819
I-I can have Gram wire you
some money if you need.

39:46.862 --> 39:48.777
No, no, don't do that.
I-I'll figure it out.

39:48.821 --> 39:50.257
Thanks, Dad.

39:51.301 --> 39:52.912
Bye.

40:06.229 --> 40:08.231
Uh, Max.

40:08.275 --> 40:09.842
Salut.

41:11.860 --> 41:13.906
-D'accord.
-Ay.

41:16.648 --> 41:18.954
Now, once the oil company
has a lease--

41:18.998 --> 41:20.347
Give it here, M.

41:20.390 --> 41:21.479
Come on.

41:22.523 --> 41:25.308
Once that oil company
has that lease,

41:25.352 --> 41:27.180
they hire a drilling company.

41:27.223 --> 41:28.964
That's who I work for.

41:29.008 --> 41:31.010
And then we get there,
we rig up

41:31.053 --> 41:32.402
and we put
all that shit together.

41:32.446 --> 41:35.449
Once we have that rig up,

41:35.493 --> 41:37.190
we start making hole.

41:37.233 --> 41:38.974
That's what a roughneck does.

41:39.018 --> 41:40.106
We make hole.

41:40.149 --> 41:42.500
All right, test it.

41:44.197 --> 41:45.328
Go on, flush it.

41:45.372 --> 41:47.026
Get it.

41:47.069 --> 41:48.244
-Flush.
-Ah, flush.

41:48.288 --> 41:50.420
-Yeah.
-D'accord.

41:50.464 --> 41:52.248
-Flush.
-

41:52.292 --> 41:54.555
-CÃ‡a va?
-Hell yeah, Ã§a va!

41:54.599 --> 41:57.863
-

42:00.039 --> 42:01.344
VIRGINIE:
Bill, come.

42:01.388 --> 42:02.520
Come here.

42:02.563 --> 42:04.913
Come and see this.

42:04.957 --> 42:06.567
Nedjma is a technical genius.

42:06.611 --> 42:08.569
I'm not a genius.
I'm just younger.

42:11.137 --> 42:13.443
-Okay...
-These are online or some shit?

42:13.487 --> 42:15.358
These are all from
Instagram accounts

42:15.402 --> 42:17.491
of Souad and her bitchy friend.

42:17.535 --> 42:20.102
And these photos
are all from the party.

42:20.146 --> 42:21.408
How'd y'all get them?

42:21.451 --> 42:23.541
I set up
a false Instagram account,

42:23.584 --> 42:26.500
followed Souad and her lovely
friend whose name is Samira,

42:26.544 --> 42:28.067
and then geotagged the party

42:28.110 --> 42:29.895
Souad was at
when she saw this guy.

42:29.938 --> 42:33.246
So there's a chance
Akim is in one of these photos.

42:38.338 --> 42:40.253
VIRGINIE:
...Arab and light skin.

42:40.296 --> 42:42.037
Yeah, uh, light skin,
yeah, and tall.

42:48.478 --> 42:50.132
So we're going
to print them up,

42:50.176 --> 42:52.047
and then you can show them
to Allison.

42:53.048 --> 42:55.355
-No, I'm not gonna do that.
-Why?

42:55.398 --> 42:57.400
If Akim is there, she'll know.

42:57.444 --> 42:59.141
I don't care.

42:59.185 --> 43:01.274
I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna do it to her.

43:01.317 --> 43:02.928
I got to protect her.

43:02.971 --> 43:04.407
I don't understand.

43:04.451 --> 43:07.410
Wh-why you're being
so stubborn about Allison?

43:07.454 --> 43:09.325
What we should do
is go back to Souad

43:09.369 --> 43:10.936
now we got those pictures.

43:10.979 --> 43:13.634
Well, we stole these photos
from Instagram,

43:13.678 --> 43:15.505
so I'm not sure
this is a good idea.

43:17.246 --> 43:19.335
-Well...
-NEDJMA: Can I say something?

43:19.379 --> 43:20.989
Ouais, vas-y.

43:21.033 --> 43:23.426
Did anyone else in Marseille
see this Akim guy

43:23.470 --> 43:25.254
or just Allison?

43:25.298 --> 43:27.039
Bar owner.

43:27.082 --> 43:28.257
Where they met.

43:28.301 --> 43:29.737
He was at the trial.

43:29.781 --> 43:31.565
-He didn't do shit, but...
-VIRGINIE: Okay.

43:31.609 --> 43:34.089
Uh, what's it called, the bar?
What's the name?

43:34.133 --> 43:35.961
I don't remember
the name of it.

43:36.004 --> 43:38.616
-It was near her apartment.
-Yeah. Okay.

43:38.659 --> 43:39.704
-Mm.
-Mm.

43:58.200 --> 43:59.332
Okay.

43:59.375 --> 44:01.508
Bill, did you vote for Trump?

44:02.640 --> 44:03.989
No.

44:04.032 --> 44:06.469
Ah. VoilÃ .

44:06.513 --> 44:08.733
-I didn't vote.
-VIRGINIE: What?

44:08.776 --> 44:11.605
-Why didn't you vote?
-Got a record.

44:11.649 --> 44:14.129
I was arrested.

44:14.173 --> 44:16.218
They don't let you vote
when that happens.

44:34.236 --> 44:36.586
VIRGINIE:
It's there, around that corner.

44:38.545 --> 44:42.244
Your friend, uh, Nedjma...

44:42.288 --> 44:44.682
she mad at you for helping me?

44:44.725 --> 44:47.772
Don't worry about Nedjma;
she's generally hostile.

44:47.815 --> 44:50.209
You know, she's very protective
with me,

44:50.252 --> 44:51.689
but she's a good friend.

44:51.732 --> 44:54.169
She helps me with Maya.

44:54.213 --> 44:56.781
BILL:
Where's Maya's father?

44:56.824 --> 45:00.088
VIRGINIE: Corsica, running
a nightclub on the beach.

45:00.132 --> 45:02.612
He was a... a fling.

45:02.656 --> 45:04.527
-That's how you say?
-Fling, yeah.

45:04.571 --> 45:06.225
Yeah.

45:06.268 --> 45:07.748
Does he visit?

45:07.792 --> 45:10.055
He used to, but it's better
when he doesn't.

45:12.622 --> 45:14.189
What?

45:15.147 --> 45:17.192
BILL:
That's where Allison lived.

45:19.455 --> 45:20.805
Twenty-one.

45:21.806 --> 45:24.765
That's where it happened?

45:24.809 --> 45:26.375
Yeah.

45:33.731 --> 45:35.602
-Bonjour.
-Bonjour.

45:48.441 --> 45:49.790
He's the new owner.

45:49.834 --> 45:52.401
He wasn't there
when the crime happened.

45:52.445 --> 45:54.447
Does he know where we could
find the old owner?

45:54.490 --> 45:56.579
Yes, I know.

45:56.623 --> 45:57.755
He's right there.

45:57.798 --> 45:59.800
Drinking my profits.

46:14.815 --> 46:16.382
Euhm...

46:21.430 --> 46:24.303
He recognize anybody?

46:40.275 --> 46:41.799
BILL:
What's he saying?

46:59.904 --> 47:01.296
Putain.

47:01.340 --> 47:03.646
Okay. CÃ‡'est bon.Let's go.

47:03.690 --> 47:04.778
What'd he say?

47:04.822 --> 47:06.345
Nothing. He's useless.

47:09.565 --> 47:10.915
Hey.

47:14.353 --> 47:16.311
Hey!

47:16.355 --> 47:18.574
Hey! What happened?

47:18.618 --> 47:20.881
I'm sorry. I just, uh-- I can't
talk to that guy anymore.

47:20.925 --> 47:23.275
He was just saying
some horrible things.

47:23.318 --> 47:24.885
Like what?

47:24.929 --> 47:26.931
Like he just wants to put
an Arab kid in jail, you know?

47:26.974 --> 47:28.758
He doesn't care which one.

47:28.802 --> 47:30.804
That's it?

47:31.805 --> 47:33.502
That's it?
What do you mean, "That's it"?

47:33.546 --> 47:34.677
He's a racist.

47:34.721 --> 47:36.375
Okay, he's a racist.

47:36.418 --> 47:37.680
We still got to talk to him.

47:37.724 --> 47:39.682
No. I don't talk to him, no.

47:39.726 --> 47:41.554
Well, he might know something.

47:41.597 --> 47:43.208
No, he doesn't know something!

47:43.251 --> 47:45.471
Bill, we're not gonna send
an innocent boy to jail.

47:45.514 --> 47:47.386
My daughter is innocent.

47:47.429 --> 47:50.215
Quoi? Oh, putain.Can't believe
this conversation.

47:50.258 --> 47:53.348
Well, then y-you live
in some fancy-ass world, honey,

47:53.392 --> 47:55.394
'cause I work with guys
like that all the time.

47:55.437 --> 47:57.352
No, but it doesn't matter, okay?
It's not right.

47:57.396 --> 47:58.788
I'm not saying it's ri...

47:58.832 --> 47:59.877
I'm trying to get
my little girl out of jail.

47:59.920 --> 48:01.356
That's all I give a fuck about.

48:01.400 --> 48:04.011
And you sound
very American right now.

48:04.055 --> 48:06.231
Good. I am.

48:06.274 --> 48:07.623
Yeah, and you're also
a stranger here.

48:07.667 --> 48:09.234
You don't understand shit.
You know what?

48:34.781 --> 48:36.609
Mr. Baker, one moment please.

48:36.652 --> 48:38.002
You have a message.

48:39.046 --> 48:41.005
:
She said you need more money

48:41.048 --> 48:43.050
because Leparq
reopened the case?

48:43.094 --> 48:44.834
BILL:
I'm dealing with it, Sharon.

48:44.878 --> 48:46.836
-Dealing with what?
-Nothing.

48:46.880 --> 48:49.491
I mean, Allison told me
to give her a letter.

48:49.535 --> 48:52.016
I did, and now Leparq's
looking into it.

48:52.059 --> 48:54.583
Well, i-is she looking
for Akim again?

48:54.627 --> 48:57.282
I'm-I'm-- I told you
I'm dealing with it, Sharon.

48:57.325 --> 49:00.024
-Who is gonna pay for this?
-Nobody's talking about money.

49:00.067 --> 49:01.373
Okay?

49:01.416 --> 49:03.375
Bill, have you been drinking?

49:03.418 --> 49:04.724
No.

49:04.767 --> 49:06.030
Listen, Sharon, I'm her father.

49:06.073 --> 49:07.857
Oh, my God, Bill.

49:07.901 --> 49:09.772
You're supposed to visit
and come home.

49:09.816 --> 49:11.339
Don't mess with this.

49:11.383 --> 49:12.950
Y-You're gonna need
to trust me on this.

49:12.993 --> 49:14.516
That's it.

49:14.560 --> 49:15.909
I'm gonna call Leparq.

49:15.953 --> 49:17.563
No, don't do that, Sharon.

49:17.606 --> 49:18.781
-Sharon!
-

49:23.699 --> 49:26.441
-

49:31.881 --> 49:33.753
Dad, what is going on?

49:33.796 --> 49:35.624
I talked to Gram, she said that
you're acting really weird.

49:35.668 --> 49:37.452
All right, I just need you
to trust me, all right?

49:37.496 --> 49:40.020
I need you to look
at these pictures.

49:40.064 --> 49:41.674
ALLISON:
Dad?

49:41.717 --> 49:43.632
Dad...

49:43.676 --> 49:44.894
are you drinking?

49:44.938 --> 49:47.593
What? No, never.

49:47.636 --> 49:49.029
Are you using?

49:49.073 --> 49:51.466
Ally, I'm done with that shit.
You know that.

49:51.510 --> 49:52.859
Now, come on,
look at these pictures.

49:52.902 --> 49:54.817
Wh-What the fuck are these?!
Where's Leparq?!

49:54.861 --> 49:56.471
-Wh-Why isn't she here?!
-Just look at the photos

49:56.515 --> 49:58.604
and tell me if you see Akim!

50:00.040 --> 50:01.999
I think he's in there.

50:03.478 --> 50:05.045
Please, baby.

50:05.089 --> 50:07.482
Please.

50:09.049 --> 50:10.790
Please.

50:19.625 --> 50:22.671
-No, I don't see him.
-Okay, all right. There's more.

50:22.715 --> 50:24.543
There's more.

50:36.685 --> 50:37.991
Holy shit.

50:39.732 --> 50:40.863
Holy shit.

50:40.907 --> 50:42.039
You see him? Which one?

50:42.082 --> 50:44.084
That's him.

50:44.128 --> 50:45.781
That's him. That's Akim.

50:45.825 --> 50:48.523
You're sure?
That's the guy from that night?

50:48.567 --> 50:51.439
Daddy, that's him.

50:55.835 --> 50:57.576
Kalliste?

51:00.013 --> 51:01.928
Yeah. Uh, oui.In there.

51:01.971 --> 51:03.843
Just drive on in.

51:12.156 --> 51:13.896
Thank you.

51:27.780 --> 51:29.216
Excuse me, ma'am.

51:29.260 --> 51:30.870
Ma'am, you seen that guy before?

51:32.654 --> 51:34.134

51:34.178 --> 51:37.877
Ma'am, have you
seen him before? Akim?

51:41.924 --> 51:43.143
Excuse me, sir.

51:43.187 --> 51:45.537
-You seen that guy before?
-Non.

51:45.580 --> 51:47.582
BILL: How about you?
Have you seen this guy before?

51:47.626 --> 51:48.801
WOMAN:
Nan.

51:53.501 --> 51:56.156
-Looking for him. Akim.
-No.

51:56.200 --> 51:58.158
You know him? Akim?

51:58.202 --> 51:59.768
Non.

52:09.996 --> 52:11.128
Excuse me.

Y'all know this guy?

52:12.868 --> 52:14.522

52:28.928 --> 52:30.059
BILL:

52:30.103 --> 52:31.496
Akim?

52:31.539 --> 52:32.975
Non, non. Non, non, non.

52:33.019 --> 52:34.281

52:52.691 --> 52:54.649
Hey. You know that guy?

52:54.693 --> 52:56.608
-Right there? Akim?

52:56.651 --> 52:58.175
You know him?

52:58.218 --> 52:59.915
-This guy, Akim, he lives here?
-

52:59.959 --> 53:01.656
Yeah.

53:03.223 --> 53:04.746
How about... Akim?

53:04.790 --> 53:06.183
-Non, non.

53:07.271 --> 53:08.750
MAN:
Bye-bye, cowboy.

53:24.984 --> 53:26.942

53:41.043 --> 53:42.044
You speak English?

53:44.090 --> 53:46.745
Hey, you know this guy?
This-- His name's Akim.

53:46.788 --> 53:48.355
He li-- he lives here.

53:48.399 --> 53:49.878
Akim?

53:49.922 --> 53:51.315
-The guy lives here.

53:58.104 --> 54:00.585
I-I speak English.
You suck my dick.

55:18.358 --> 55:19.881
MAN:
Allez!

55:32.198 --> 55:34.200
-Ici.
-Merci.

55:37.769 --> 55:39.161
Hi.

55:41.773 --> 55:43.862
They asked me
if I knew anybody.

55:45.124 --> 55:46.343
Are you okay?

55:47.735 --> 55:49.694
I saw him.

55:49.737 --> 55:51.260
I saw Akim.

55:51.304 --> 55:53.437
In Kalliste.

55:53.480 --> 55:55.221
Did you tell the police?

56:02.097 --> 56:04.056
That was my chance.

56:06.275 --> 56:08.321
That was my chance.

56:44.488 --> 56:46.315
What the fuck did you do?

56:46.359 --> 56:48.317
I was trying to help.

56:48.361 --> 56:50.494
Tell me exactly
what you did, Dad.

56:52.104 --> 56:53.322
Dad.

56:54.454 --> 56:56.456
She wouldn't do it, Ally.

56:56.500 --> 56:58.850
Leparq wouldn't
look into the case.

57:01.592 --> 57:03.332
:
Oh, my God.

57:04.333 --> 57:06.379
You fucking lied.

57:07.598 --> 57:09.295
About all of it.

57:09.338 --> 57:11.123
Of course you did.

57:11.166 --> 57:13.908
I found him, Ally.

57:13.952 --> 57:15.344
I found Akim.

57:15.388 --> 57:18.913
And why didn't you
call the police?

57:18.957 --> 57:20.219
Why?!

57:21.220 --> 57:22.787
Why?!

57:23.527 --> 57:25.485
You let him get away!

57:25.529 --> 57:27.356
-He's fucking gone now!
-

57:27.400 --> 57:29.446
He's fucking gone!

57:30.490 --> 57:33.798
I feel so stupid.
I feel so stupid.

57:33.841 --> 57:38.193
You've always lied to me,
my entire life, always!

57:38.237 --> 57:41.240
I hate myself
for ever trusting you!

57:47.507 --> 57:49.466
-Ally, listen to me.
-No!

57:49.509 --> 57:51.511
No! No.

57:53.295 --> 57:56.821
You are done
fucking up my life.

57:57.604 --> 57:59.476
Do you get that?

58:00.564 --> 58:03.305
Do you?

58:03.349 --> 58:05.917
Stay the fuck away from me.

58:24.544 --> 58:27.242
MAN:
Bill! Bill!

58:31.638 --> 58:33.858
-Hey, guys.

58:44.129 --> 58:46.087
HÃ©, Bill.

58:46.131 --> 58:48.525
-Yeah, I got it.

59:02.495 --> 59:05.237
the TV screen

59:13.419 --> 59:16.640
just like a loaded gun

59:16.683 --> 59:21.079
I'm six feet underground...

59:34.396 --> 59:36.355
-HÃ©, Bill.
-How we doing?

59:36.398 --> 59:37.574
How was school today? Good?

59:37.617 --> 59:39.140
-You get it done?
-

59:39.184 --> 59:40.446
All right, come on. Let's go.

59:40.489 --> 59:42.143
-Yeah, I got it.

59:42.187 --> 59:44.145
-Here. I got you that.
-

59:46.495 --> 59:48.976
Maya, you got to eat
the whole thing.

59:51.370 --> 59:52.937
I see what you're doing,

59:52.980 --> 59:55.200
but you got to eat
the bread part, too.

01:00:00.292 --> 01:00:02.076
Oh, you gonna
pawn it off on me?

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:03.382
All right.

01:00:08.474 --> 01:00:09.997
Bill.

01:00:11.129 --> 01:00:13.479
Uh... un marteau.

01:00:13.522 --> 01:00:15.394
Oui. TrÃ¨s bien. Marteau.

01:00:15.437 --> 01:00:17.483
-Hammer.
-Hammer.

01:00:19.746 --> 01:00:22.401
Uh... ciseau...

01:00:22.444 --> 01:00:24.446
Uh... ciseausomething.

01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:26.753
-Ciseau Ã  bois.
-Ciseau Ã  bois.

01:00:26.797 --> 01:00:29.451
That's a shitload of words
for "chisel."

01:00:29.495 --> 01:00:31.540
-Chisel.
-Come on in. Get the light.

01:00:32.672 --> 01:00:35.370
-LumiÃ¨re.
-LumiÃ¨re.

01:00:35.414 --> 01:00:37.459
-

01:00:44.075 --> 01:00:45.598
Maya, supper.

01:00:47.426 --> 01:00:48.645
Maya.

01:00:51.256 --> 01:00:53.388
That bald guy's
gonna lose his shirt.

01:00:59.699 --> 01:01:00.744
-Oh, non.
-

01:01:00.787 --> 01:01:02.267
Yeah, that's how they do it.

01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:05.444
Cut to commercial
before the big reveal.

01:01:05.487 --> 01:01:07.185
Come on, let's eat.

01:01:07.228 --> 01:01:09.274
-Come on.
-

01:01:11.711 --> 01:01:13.757
You do your homework?

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.455
-Homework?
-Ah, non.

01:01:16.498 --> 01:01:18.326
Well, appreciate the honesty.

01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:20.328
Yeah, I used to
hate school, too.

01:01:20.372 --> 01:01:22.156
Hated everything about it.

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:25.682
Dropped out of high school,
worked a rig like my daddy,

01:01:25.725 --> 01:01:27.292
started making hole.

01:01:27.335 --> 01:01:29.729
That what you gonna do?
You gonna make hole?

01:01:29.773 --> 01:01:32.601
-Oui,I make hole.
-: No shit.

01:01:32.645 --> 01:01:34.429
You got to start out a worm,
you know.

01:01:34.473 --> 01:01:36.823
That's the lowest of the low.
A worm.

01:01:36.867 --> 01:01:38.695
Non, pas unworm.

01:01:38.738 --> 01:01:40.609
Je veux travailler
sur le derrick,like you.

01:01:40.653 --> 01:01:42.133
You going right to the derrick?

01:01:42.176 --> 01:01:44.309
You got to have the want-to.

01:01:44.352 --> 01:01:45.832
You got the want-to?

01:01:45.876 --> 01:01:48.139
Ben, oui.

01:01:48.182 --> 01:01:49.575
Hey.

01:01:52.752 --> 01:01:54.841
-Thank you, Lord, for this and
other blessings. -

01:01:54.885 --> 01:01:56.234
-Please look after Ally.
-

01:01:56.277 --> 01:01:57.278
Keep a close eye on her.

01:01:57.322 --> 01:01:59.411
We ask this in Jesus' name.

01:01:59.454 --> 01:02:00.586
Amen.

01:02:00.629 --> 01:02:02.109
-Dig in.
-Dig in.

01:02:02.153 --> 01:02:03.720
-VIRGINIE: Bonsoir.
-Bonsoir, maman.

01:02:03.763 --> 01:02:05.286
-Hey.
-BILL: Hey.

01:02:11.597 --> 01:02:14.513
-There's a burger up there
if you want it. -Thanks. Ah.

01:02:14.556 --> 01:02:15.688
For me?

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.081
Yes, ma'am.

01:02:17.124 --> 01:02:18.430
-That's rent.
-Thank you.

01:02:20.824 --> 01:02:23.609
Would you please
get me the ketchup?

01:02:27.656 --> 01:02:29.223
MAYA:
Non.

01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:32.705
-Mais oui.
-BILL: Thank you.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.881
Bill, she has to do
her homework.

01:02:34.925 --> 01:02:38.145
I know. Hundred percent.

01:02:38.189 --> 01:02:39.407
Do your homework.

01:02:41.496 --> 01:02:43.368
-Yeah?
-Mm.

01:02:43.411 --> 01:02:45.326
Merci.

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:48.329
When I see what you guys eat, I
understand why you pray before.

01:02:49.678 --> 01:02:52.681
-How was play practice?
-Rehearsal.

01:02:52.725 --> 01:02:55.293
Uh, it was shit.

01:02:55.336 --> 01:02:58.296
We do a lot of stage writing,
so it's messy,

01:02:58.339 --> 01:03:02.343
and, uh, the-the director--
he's young and provincial.

01:03:02.387 --> 01:03:04.476
What's stage writing?

01:03:04.519 --> 01:03:08.306
We don't know what we're doing,
so we make it up instead.

01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:09.611
Cool.

01:03:09.655 --> 01:03:11.831
Cool Raoul.

01:03:14.399 --> 01:03:16.270
Drops back,
scrambles to the middle.

01:03:16.314 --> 01:03:19.447
Down inside the ten,
so the clock is running,

01:03:19.491 --> 01:03:20.797
-clock is running.

01:03:22.668 --> 01:03:24.452
BILL:
Back to bed.

01:03:24.496 --> 01:03:25.932
I look with you?

01:03:25.976 --> 01:03:28.369
No way.

01:03:28.413 --> 01:03:29.544
Bed.

01:03:29.588 --> 01:03:31.633
You're gonna get me in trouble.

01:03:31.677 --> 01:03:32.896
My tablet.

01:03:32.939 --> 01:03:34.854
Yeah, I'm using it.

01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:36.377
Bed, now.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:43.558
SPORTSCASTER: ...fourth
quarter. Well, why not?

01:03:43.602 --> 01:03:45.647
-

01:04:00.662 --> 01:04:02.186
Hello?

01:04:03.274 --> 01:04:04.536
Yeah, this is him.

01:04:06.364 --> 01:04:08.192
LEPARQ:
It's a one-day leave.

01:04:08.235 --> 01:04:09.671
She goes out in the morning,

01:04:09.715 --> 01:04:11.456
comes back to the prison
at night.

01:04:11.499 --> 01:04:12.849
Then if it goes well,

01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:14.938
she'll get another day
the following month.

01:04:14.981 --> 01:04:16.983
The idea is for inmates
to acclimate

01:04:17.027 --> 01:04:18.855
to the outside world again.

01:04:18.898 --> 01:04:20.291
Understand?

01:04:20.334 --> 01:04:21.596
Yes, ma'am, I do.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:25.209
The judge requires a chaperone,

01:04:25.252 --> 01:04:27.646
someone who is
going to vouch for her.

01:04:28.908 --> 01:04:30.649
Did she ask for me?

01:04:31.693 --> 01:04:32.869
No.

01:04:32.912 --> 01:04:35.872
But you are the only option.

01:04:35.915 --> 01:04:37.874
Okay.
A-Allison hasn't talked to me

01:04:37.917 --> 01:04:39.571
for more than four months.

01:04:40.572 --> 01:04:41.965
I am aware.

01:04:43.662 --> 01:04:45.359
:
Mr. Baker,

01:04:45.403 --> 01:04:47.535
do not take any initiative
this time.

01:04:47.579 --> 01:04:49.798
Understand?

01:04:49.842 --> 01:04:51.931
Yes, ma'am, I do.

01:05:35.496 --> 01:05:36.758
Huh?

01:05:36.802 --> 01:05:38.760
Color she love.

01:05:38.804 --> 01:05:40.371
Oh, her favorite color?

01:05:40.414 --> 01:05:41.459
Ah, oui,"favorite."

01:05:41.502 --> 01:05:42.764
Yeah, not sure.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:49.989
Hey, Maya?

01:05:51.077 --> 01:05:52.644
No.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.431
I thought it was pretty.

01:05:57.475 --> 01:05:58.824
Bill! Bill!

01:06:04.003 --> 01:06:06.484
Ah, soccer, no.
Allison likes Oklahoma State.

01:06:06.527 --> 01:06:08.355
She likes real football.

01:06:08.399 --> 01:06:09.835
This is football,
favorite foot.

01:06:09.878 --> 01:06:11.924
No, these guys
are a bunch of babies.

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:13.317
Bunch of crybabies.

01:06:18.626 --> 01:06:20.846
All right, all right, don't
get all wound up. How much?

01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:27.679
Maman.

01:06:33.032 --> 01:06:34.555
Euh, non.

01:06:34.599 --> 01:06:35.948
Merci, Bill.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:38.342
-All right.
-VIRGINIE: Merci, Bill.

01:06:39.604 --> 01:06:40.953
-Oui.
-Bonjour, Maya.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:43.042
Bonjour.

01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:45.044
Hi. You must be Bill.

01:06:45.088 --> 01:06:46.437
Yes, sir. Hi.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.395
Good to meet you.

01:06:48.439 --> 01:06:52.356
Uh, Virginie told me
you-you are from Oklahoma.

01:06:52.399 --> 01:06:53.705
That's so cool.

01:06:55.098 --> 01:06:56.534
Okay.

01:06:56.577 --> 01:06:59.145
Renaud is
a rising star director.

01:06:59.189 --> 01:07:00.842
That's me.

01:07:00.886 --> 01:07:02.888
Oh, you're the one
who does the stage writing?

01:07:02.931 --> 01:07:05.499
Yeah. You know about
stage writing?

01:07:05.543 --> 01:07:07.023
Great.

01:07:07.066 --> 01:07:09.895
Y-You know, man, I really love
working like this.

01:07:09.938 --> 01:07:11.027
It's real, you know?

01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:14.639
Stage writing? It's truth.

01:07:14.682 --> 01:07:16.684
It's from life.

01:07:17.903 --> 01:07:19.513
Virginie been telling me
about it, right?

01:07:19.557 --> 01:07:21.559
Yeah. Merci, Bill.

01:07:21.602 --> 01:07:23.778
Um, would you help me
move the table?

01:07:23.822 --> 01:07:25.519
-'Cause dinner is...
-Yeah, I got it.

01:07:25.563 --> 01:07:27.043
Merci, Bill.

01:07:27.086 --> 01:07:29.871
RENAUD: Seriously, for me,
it makes total sense.

01:07:29.915 --> 01:07:31.569
People should be able
to carry guns.

01:07:33.136 --> 01:07:34.093
You know, but they got freedom.

01:07:34.137 --> 01:07:35.703
It's basic freedom.

01:07:35.747 --> 01:07:37.575
-I would love to have a gun.
-

01:07:40.491 --> 01:07:41.970
I'm sure you have a gun.

01:07:42.014 --> 01:07:44.190
-Don't you, Bill?
-Yes, sir, I do.

01:07:44.234 --> 01:07:47.063
-Yes!
-No, you do not.

01:07:47.106 --> 01:07:49.065
Why wouldn't I?
I got two of them.

01:07:49.108 --> 01:07:51.110
I got a shotgun and a Glock.

01:07:51.154 --> 01:07:53.504
-Oh, non, putain. C'est pas
vrai.-Two guns! It's perfect!

01:07:53.547 --> 01:07:55.810
Non, non. ArrÃªte, arrte.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:07:55.854 --> 01:07:57.203
It's-it's his...

01:07:57.247 --> 01:07:59.510
-His-his... his culture.
-: Culture.

01:07:59.553 --> 01:08:01.164
Culture is
such a broad concept, huh?

01:08:02.948 --> 01:08:04.645
I'm gonna call it
a night, y'all.

01:08:04.689 --> 01:08:06.473
Come on, Bill. It's early.

01:08:06.517 --> 01:08:08.649
-I'll put Maya to bed.
-Oh, I can do it.

01:08:08.693 --> 01:08:10.738
-I got it.
-Okay.

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.136
You're my favorite.

01:08:18.964 --> 01:08:20.444
Favorite what?

01:08:21.270 --> 01:08:24.055
Favorite American.

01:08:29.017 --> 01:08:31.063
Sweet dreams, little girl.

01:08:59.831 --> 01:09:02.094
VIRGINIE: You know
it's Sunday morning, right?

01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:03.617
BILL:
Where's your friend?

01:09:04.662 --> 01:09:07.185
Oh, he left early this morning.

01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:08.970
Mm.

01:09:09.014 --> 01:09:10.971
We had a bit too much to drink.

01:09:11.015 --> 01:09:12.800
Ain't no shit.

01:09:16.282 --> 01:09:21.200
I was thinking, uh, I'd like
to bring Allison by the house.

01:09:22.245 --> 01:09:24.769
Won't it be too much for her?

01:09:24.812 --> 01:09:27.162
I'd like her to see
where I live.

01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:29.948
If you're okay with it.

01:09:29.991 --> 01:09:32.037
Why wouldn't I be?

01:09:33.212 --> 01:09:35.214
Not everybody is.

01:09:54.581 --> 01:09:57.149
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:09:59.282 --> 01:10:00.848
This your van?

01:10:00.892 --> 01:10:02.850
From work.

01:10:02.894 --> 01:10:04.765
What work?

01:10:04.809 --> 01:10:06.158
Construction.

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:08.247
I told you about it
in my letters.

01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:09.553
You didn't get them?

01:10:09.596 --> 01:10:11.294
I did.

01:10:12.904 --> 01:10:14.210
I didn't read them.

01:10:16.864 --> 01:10:18.910
-You want to get going?
-Yeah.

01:10:30.269 --> 01:10:31.836
Merci.

01:11:17.838 --> 01:11:19.884
Life is brutal.

01:11:27.108 --> 01:11:28.980
Can I drive?

01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:40.121
by brothers

01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:45.953
ALLISON: I haven't heard
this song in a while.

01:11:45.997 --> 01:11:47.825
BILL:
Special playlist for today.

01:11:49.174 --> 01:11:51.959
How old is that thing?

01:11:52.003 --> 01:11:53.439
It still works.

01:11:53.483 --> 01:11:57.095
foggy feeling when I'm...

01:11:57.138 --> 01:11:59.184
So you never went home?

01:12:00.185 --> 01:12:01.969
Nope.

01:12:02.013 --> 01:12:04.015
How come?

01:12:04.058 --> 01:12:06.974
to keep believing

01:12:09.368 --> 01:12:15.200
beats your hope in the ground

01:12:15.243 --> 01:12:20.205
it's really coming down

01:12:20.248 --> 01:12:22.163
I'm...
-

01:12:22.207 --> 01:12:24.165
Are you sure we can park here?

01:12:24.209 --> 01:12:25.906
What are they gonna do?

01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:27.691
Arrest me?

01:14:10.184 --> 01:14:11.795
O.M.

01:14:11.838 --> 01:14:13.927
You really are a local now.

01:14:13.971 --> 01:14:15.320
Maya sold me on it.

01:14:15.363 --> 01:14:17.061
That's her favorite team.

01:14:18.105 --> 01:14:19.542
Does this kid have a father?

01:14:19.585 --> 01:14:21.892
He's not around.

01:14:21.935 --> 01:14:23.894
Lives on a beach or some shit.

01:14:23.937 --> 01:14:25.809
Groovy.

01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:30.248
So is this woman
your girlfriend?

01:14:30.291 --> 01:14:31.858
It's not like that.

01:14:31.902 --> 01:14:33.947
I just live with them.

01:14:33.991 --> 01:14:35.471
Like roommates.

01:14:37.037 --> 01:14:38.430
What does she do?

01:14:39.562 --> 01:14:41.955
She's sort of an actress.

01:14:41.999 --> 01:14:43.522
Sort of an actress?

01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:46.830
She a stripper?

01:14:46.873 --> 01:14:48.266
No.

01:14:50.311 --> 01:14:52.270
She just don't do
TV acting or anything.

01:14:52.313 --> 01:14:54.533
She does theater.

01:14:55.578 --> 01:14:57.144
Theater.

01:14:58.885 --> 01:15:01.235
Have you seen her act?

01:15:01.279 --> 01:15:04.848
What am I gonna do
in a fucking theater?

01:15:06.545 --> 01:15:08.068
Yeah.

01:15:16.163 --> 01:15:18.209
You know what's messed-up?

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.518
I never had a chance
to mourn her.

01:15:22.561 --> 01:15:24.084
Lina.

01:15:27.305 --> 01:15:30.177
It was so intense
when we first met.

01:15:32.136 --> 01:15:34.051
She was so funny.

01:15:35.139 --> 01:15:37.533
And cool and beautiful.

01:15:41.972 --> 01:15:44.191
Then she moved in,
and everything got fucked-up.

01:15:45.715 --> 01:15:48.500
She started sleeping
with other people.

01:15:50.197 --> 01:15:52.243
Like it didn't matter.

01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:58.336
Like she was just using me.

01:15:59.424 --> 01:16:01.121
Or something.

01:16:05.082 --> 01:16:08.172
:
And I felt so humiliated.

01:16:11.044 --> 01:16:13.438
But, you know, the really
fucked-up thing is...

01:16:15.483 --> 01:16:17.529
...I just want to see her.

01:16:20.445 --> 01:16:22.490
I just want to be with her.

01:16:24.971 --> 01:16:26.364
So much.

01:16:31.543 --> 01:16:33.501
VIRGINIE:
Oui.

01:16:33.545 --> 01:16:35.634
Ouais.

01:16:37.375 --> 01:16:38.637
-

01:16:38.681 --> 01:16:39.595
-

01:16:45.644 --> 01:16:48.691
-Bonjour. -Bonjour.
-BILL: This is Allison.

01:16:48.734 --> 01:16:50.344
Thanks, Dad.
I think she knew that.

01:16:50.388 --> 01:16:52.608
:
I'm Virginie.

01:16:52.651 --> 01:16:54.305
I'm Allison.

01:16:54.348 --> 01:16:55.523
-EnchantÃ©e.
-EnchantÃ©e.

01:16:55.567 --> 01:16:57.961
-Come. Come in.
-Merci.

01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:02.139
Maya? Maya?

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:04.707
BILL:
Get out here.

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:07.274
Wait. Attends.

01:17:20.766 --> 01:17:22.072
Ouais.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:27.991
MAYA:
Oui.

01:17:42.527 --> 01:17:43.659
Ouais.

01:18:06.072 --> 01:18:07.247
Oui.

01:18:13.645 --> 01:18:15.255
:
Hey, y'all.

01:18:21.174 --> 01:18:22.785
-Ah, watch out. It's hot.
It's hot. -Ow, that's...

01:18:22.828 --> 01:18:25.396
-Yeah. Well, then take this.
-I got it.

01:18:25.439 --> 01:18:28.225
I got it. I got it. I got it.

01:18:35.449 --> 01:18:36.450
Let's pray.

01:18:38.278 --> 01:18:40.063
Thank you, Lord, for this
and many other blessings.

01:18:40.106 --> 01:18:42.326
Thank you for this special day
with Ally.

01:18:42.369 --> 01:18:45.459
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

01:18:45.503 --> 01:18:46.504
Maya?

01:18:46.547 --> 01:18:48.375
Dig in.

01:18:51.683 --> 01:18:53.772
-There you go.
-Merci.

01:18:54.817 --> 01:18:56.383
Thank you.

01:18:58.646 --> 01:19:00.692
So you two
really aren't having sex?

01:19:01.911 --> 01:19:03.347
Allison Baker.

01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:05.088
What?

01:19:05.131 --> 01:19:06.872
You're so French now,
I-I thought it was okay

01:19:06.916 --> 01:19:09.353
to talk about sex
at the dinner table.

01:19:09.396 --> 01:19:10.746
Sorry.

01:19:11.834 --> 01:19:13.444
Is it okay?

01:19:13.487 --> 01:19:14.706
The food.

01:19:15.707 --> 01:19:17.317
It's honestly
the best meal I've had

01:19:17.361 --> 01:19:19.145
in a really long time.

01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:20.581
Good.

01:19:21.713 --> 01:19:23.410
And, no, we don't have sex.

01:19:23.454 --> 01:19:24.760
Jesus.

01:19:26.718 --> 01:19:28.111
VIRGINIE:
Oui.

01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:34.160
So where did you
have lunch today?

01:19:34.204 --> 01:19:36.684
-Pizza.
-Pizza?

01:19:36.728 --> 01:19:39.600
-Chez Sauveur.
It's my favorite place. -Oh.

01:19:39.644 --> 01:19:41.646
-It's so good.

01:19:43.387 --> 01:19:46.782
And, uh, I'm curious, why did
you come to Marseille to study?

01:19:47.913 --> 01:19:49.306
It was far away.

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.831
And completely different.

01:19:55.181 --> 01:19:56.400
And the pizza.

01:20:00.317 --> 01:20:02.362
-I like it, too.

01:20:17.203 --> 01:20:18.814
BILL:
Uh, oh, no.

01:21:30.973 --> 01:21:32.888
He's a fuckup.

01:21:32.931 --> 01:21:34.933
Always has been.

01:22:20.761 --> 01:22:23.677
It's more beautiful
on this side of the wall.

01:22:29.335 --> 01:22:30.858
I like them.

01:22:30.902 --> 01:22:32.469
Virginie and Maya.

01:22:32.512 --> 01:22:34.732
It's good what you have.

01:22:34.775 --> 01:22:36.952
I'm just trying to do it right.

01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:39.998
I'm happy for you, Dad.

01:22:53.055 --> 01:22:54.360
-WOMAN: Bonsoir.
-Bonsoir.

01:23:00.932 --> 01:23:02.499
:
Hey.

01:23:05.589 --> 01:23:06.982
How are you doing?

01:23:08.635 --> 01:23:09.810
Pretty good.

01:23:09.854 --> 01:23:11.638
Yeah?

01:23:11.682 --> 01:23:12.988
The day was nice?

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:15.686
Flew by.

01:23:20.691 --> 01:23:21.997
Merci.

01:23:23.389 --> 01:23:24.869
Pourquoi?

01:23:26.044 --> 01:23:28.090
Everything, I guess.

01:23:32.094 --> 01:23:34.661
Oh. Bonne nuit.

01:23:34.705 --> 01:23:36.011
Good night.

01:23:49.807 --> 01:23:51.852
Hello?

01:23:57.945 --> 01:23:59.686
Excuse me.

01:23:59.730 --> 01:24:02.472
I'm Bill Baker, father of
Allison Baker, from Baumettes.

01:24:18.183 --> 01:24:20.533
What happened to her?

01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:23.580
What does that mean?

01:24:46.081 --> 01:24:47.778
Fuck off me.

01:25:08.625 --> 01:25:12.063
: I don't leave you,
you don't leave me.

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:14.935
I don't leave you,
you don't leave me.

01:25:19.636 --> 01:25:21.942
Is she okay?

01:25:21.986 --> 01:25:23.727
She's stable.

01:26:00.198 --> 01:26:02.069
Hey, Bill.

01:26:05.856 --> 01:26:07.640
BILL:
I talked to Sharon again,

01:26:07.684 --> 01:26:10.034
told her you was back in here.

01:26:11.035 --> 01:26:12.993
And work's been going good.

01:26:13.037 --> 01:26:16.083
Uh... good group of guys.

01:26:51.684 --> 01:26:54.774
16, 17,

01:26:54.818 --> 01:26:57.690
18, 16...

01:26:57.734 --> 01:26:59.214
Ah, Bill.

01:26:59.257 --> 01:27:00.737
What, did I mess it up?

01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:02.304
Oui,you messed it up.

01:27:07.265 --> 01:27:08.745
"Love at first sight.

01:27:08.788 --> 01:27:11.051
I was trapped by
how you looked at me."

01:27:11.095 --> 01:27:12.879
LumiÃ¨re.

01:27:12.923 --> 01:27:14.620
Light.

01:27:18.711 --> 01:27:20.757
Casquette.

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:22.280
Cap.

01:27:22.324 --> 01:27:24.282
-Glasses.

01:27:24.326 --> 01:27:26.023
Lunettes.

01:27:27.024 --> 01:27:28.591
Merci,hand.

01:27:35.772 --> 01:27:37.252
VIRGINIE:
Mathilde...

01:28:11.982 --> 01:28:13.157
Ah. Merci.

01:28:16.247 --> 01:28:18.031
VIRGINIE:
So, what did you think?

01:28:18.075 --> 01:28:19.772
What'd I think?

01:28:19.816 --> 01:28:22.122
Yeah. Of the play.
What did you think?

01:28:22.166 --> 01:28:24.386
Oh, it was good, yeah.

01:28:24.429 --> 01:28:26.649
Yeah? What was good?

01:28:27.998 --> 01:28:29.391
Well...

01:28:31.001 --> 01:28:33.351
I don't fucking know.
I don't know shit about plays.

01:28:33.395 --> 01:28:36.963
-Plus, it's all in French.
-Oh, come on, Bill. One thing.

01:28:39.357 --> 01:28:41.316
Uh, no one stands
like real people.

01:28:41.359 --> 01:28:43.796
: What?
-It just looks weird.

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:45.320
Look, it's great, I'm sure.

01:28:45.363 --> 01:28:46.930
I don't-- D-Don't-don't ask me.

01:28:46.973 --> 01:28:48.323
-I'm a dumbass.
-No, you're not.

01:28:48.366 --> 01:28:51.717
And, no, it's not great, no.

01:28:52.849 --> 01:28:54.024
Ah, merci.

01:28:56.418 --> 01:28:58.333
Cheers.

01:28:59.377 --> 01:29:01.858
I will say, you were...

01:29:01.901 --> 01:29:03.250
really good.

01:29:03.294 --> 01:29:04.774
Best thing up there.

01:29:08.125 --> 01:29:11.171
So, I got exciting news.

01:29:12.434 --> 01:29:14.000
I got the part.

01:29:14.044 --> 01:29:15.959
-On the TV show?
-Mm-hmm.

01:29:16.002 --> 01:29:17.874
-Yeah, and I said I'd do it.
-No shit.

01:29:17.917 --> 01:29:19.441
-That's great.
-Yeah.

01:29:19.484 --> 01:29:21.921
But...

01:29:21.965 --> 01:29:24.315
it's more money,
but it's also more hours,

01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:27.013
so that means I'll have to pay
for a babysitter

01:29:27.057 --> 01:29:28.841
and I'll be away more
from Maya.

01:29:28.885 --> 01:29:31.191
Well, I could help
with Maya, too.

01:29:31.235 --> 01:29:32.410
No, you help enough, you know?

01:29:32.454 --> 01:29:33.933
You got a job. You're busy.

01:29:33.977 --> 01:29:36.762
I don't care. I want to.

01:29:40.287 --> 01:29:41.767
Why?

01:29:42.768 --> 01:29:43.987
-Why?
-Mm.

01:29:45.336 --> 01:29:47.904
I like spending time with her.

01:29:48.905 --> 01:29:50.385
And with me, too?

01:29:52.299 --> 01:29:53.953
Yeah.

01:29:53.997 --> 01:29:55.259
And you, too.

01:29:56.826 --> 01:29:59.002
How much do you enjoy it?

01:30:01.221 --> 01:30:02.962
A lot.

01:30:03.006 --> 01:30:06.096
I would say a lot.

01:30:08.272 --> 01:30:10.927
This would be
a serious change for us.

01:30:11.928 --> 01:30:13.930
Guess it would.

01:30:13.973 --> 01:30:16.498
You guess?

01:30:16.541 --> 01:30:19.239
Well, I mean, I know.

01:30:19.283 --> 01:30:20.240
Oh.

01:30:20.284 --> 01:30:23.809
And you know... what?

01:30:23.853 --> 01:30:25.942
-Ah, for fuck's sake.
-

01:30:25.985 --> 01:30:28.161
-

01:30:35.299 --> 01:30:37.257
:
Do you have cash?

01:30:37.301 --> 01:30:39.869
Yeah. Yeah.

01:30:39.912 --> 01:30:41.523
Uh, how much is it?

01:30:45.831 --> 01:30:47.920
Sixty.

01:30:47.964 --> 01:30:49.922
No shit?

01:30:59.976 --> 01:31:02.282
-Hey.
-: Hey.

01:31:02.326 --> 01:31:03.806
This is your music.

01:31:03.849 --> 01:31:05.460
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:31:05.503 --> 01:31:07.331
I-It's a bit sad, no?
Maybe I...

01:31:07.374 --> 01:31:09.246
-Ah, hell no.
-Huh?

01:31:09.289 --> 01:31:11.944
-No, it's beautiful.
-Yeah?

01:31:11.988 --> 01:31:13.946
Yeah, you can dance to it.

01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:15.470
Really?

01:31:16.514 --> 01:31:18.516
No, no, no. Come here.

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:20.213
-Come here.

01:31:20.257 --> 01:31:21.867
I'll show you.

01:31:21.911 --> 01:31:24.304
-You show me?
-Yeah, I'll show you.

01:31:24.348 --> 01:31:26.916
by my side

01:31:26.959 --> 01:31:28.831
This is Sammi Smith.

01:31:30.615 --> 01:31:36.882
morning light

01:31:43.019 --> 01:31:45.978
through the night...

01:31:46.022 --> 01:31:48.024
Oh, we got eyes on us.

01:31:49.068 --> 01:31:50.461
Ben...

01:31:52.028 --> 01:31:53.420
Non.

01:31:54.552 --> 01:31:55.640
Oui.

01:31:55.684 --> 01:31:57.903
Viens.

01:32:11.177 --> 01:32:13.092
BILL:
Hey.

01:32:13.136 --> 01:32:14.572
-Ready for it?
-Mm-hmm.

01:32:20.056 --> 01:32:22.580
out of sight...

01:32:24.321 --> 01:32:26.149
-Hey.
-Huh?

01:32:26.192 --> 01:32:28.978
-I need to ask you something.
-What?

01:32:29.021 --> 01:32:31.067
Do you really own a gun?

01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:34.549
-Oh.
-

01:32:34.592 --> 01:32:36.986
-Two guns.
-

01:33:11.150 --> 01:33:13.196
-Hey, Maya.
-MAYA: Hmm?

01:33:13.239 --> 01:33:15.285
Want to hand me my casque?

01:33:16.503 --> 01:33:18.593
My casque.My helmet.
My hard hat.

01:33:18.636 --> 01:33:20.507
-Oh.
-Will you get it for me?

01:33:31.214 --> 01:33:33.085
Yes, ma'am.

01:33:33.129 --> 01:33:35.653
Ouais!

01:33:39.614 --> 01:33:41.616
-

01:34:05.683 --> 01:34:06.684
BILL:
Here we go.

01:34:06.728 --> 01:34:07.990
Whoa!

01:34:22.569 --> 01:34:23.527
BILL:
Oh.

01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:26.008
-Wow.
-

01:34:50.641 --> 01:34:52.687
Damn, the place is heating up.

01:34:52.730 --> 01:34:55.124
-Quoi?
-A lot of fans.

01:34:55.167 --> 01:34:56.560
Going nuts.

01:34:58.867 --> 01:35:00.738
Someone should tell them
they're winning.

01:35:51.267 --> 01:35:53.748
-All right, let's go.

01:36:25.823 --> 01:36:27.782
Pardon, pardon, pardon.

01:36:53.372 --> 01:36:54.591
Bill.

01:36:56.723 --> 01:36:59.204
Oh, I think I see
a friend from work.

01:36:59.248 --> 01:37:00.510
Want to see if it's him.

01:37:36.241 --> 01:37:37.852
Okay, let's go get the van.

01:37:37.895 --> 01:37:40.419
-MAYA: Is it your friend?
-No, that wasn't him.

01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:44.510
-Hey.
-VIRGINIE: Hey.

01:37:44.554 --> 01:37:46.599
-How's it going?
-Uh, good. Game just ended.

01:37:46.643 --> 01:37:48.210
Be home soon.

01:37:48.253 --> 01:37:49.776
-Okay, take your time.
-CÃ‡'est maman?

01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:51.691
-It's your night.
-Okay.

01:37:51.735 --> 01:37:53.780
Uh, see you in a bit.

01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:09.291
Wouah!

01:39:25.437 --> 01:39:26.786
Go back to sleep.

01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:28.963
Go on.

01:39:29.006 --> 01:39:30.660
We're going home.

01:39:48.591 --> 01:39:49.722
CÃ‡a va.

01:39:54.075 --> 01:39:55.902
Nice to see you again.

01:39:55.946 --> 01:39:56.991
You're late.

01:39:57.034 --> 01:39:58.949
Oh.

01:39:58.993 --> 01:40:00.342
Excusez-moi.

01:40:02.866 --> 01:40:04.694
What can I do for you,
Mr. Baker?

01:40:06.522 --> 01:40:08.828
That DNA test we talked about--
I want to get it done.

01:40:08.872 --> 01:40:12.354
First I will need, uh,
the DNA sample.

01:40:25.541 --> 01:40:27.891
Can I ask you how you got this?

01:40:27.934 --> 01:40:29.893
Can you do it or not?

01:40:29.936 --> 01:40:32.722
Yes, I can.

01:40:34.158 --> 01:40:37.596
But I am an ex-cop,
so let me tell you,

01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:39.859
it will be a serious mistake
to commit a crime

01:40:39.903 --> 01:40:42.601
to prove your daughter innocent.

01:40:42.645 --> 01:40:44.864
It will not get her out of jail.

01:40:44.908 --> 01:40:46.475
And it will send you in.

01:40:46.518 --> 01:40:48.868
-Do you understand?
-How fast can you do it?

01:40:51.088 --> 01:40:52.655
It's hard to say.

01:40:52.698 --> 01:40:56.093
A week at least,
but it will cost you.

01:40:56.137 --> 01:40:57.877
BILL:
Here's 3,000 now.

01:40:57.921 --> 01:40:59.705
I'll give you another 3,000
when you get it done,

01:40:59.749 --> 01:41:01.403
but it's got to be quicker
than a week.

01:41:01.446 --> 01:41:04.058
Even if it matches,
I still have to find this guy.

01:41:04.101 --> 01:41:05.755
No, you don't.

01:41:05.798 --> 01:41:07.539
You know where he is?

01:41:10.977 --> 01:41:13.980
He could still disappear
before the results come back.

01:41:14.024 --> 01:41:16.809
He won't.
Call me when you get it done.

01:41:31.215 --> 01:41:32.912
Come on.

01:41:33.913 --> 01:41:35.872
-

01:41:37.874 --> 01:41:39.441
BILL:
Maya?

01:41:42.618 --> 01:41:44.010
Maya?

01:41:49.190 --> 01:41:50.582
Hey, Maya?

01:41:54.151 --> 01:41:56.066
-Hey.

01:41:56.110 --> 01:41:57.633
-VIRGINIE: Hey.
-

01:41:57.676 --> 01:41:59.069
-This is quite a greeting.
-You seen Maya?

01:41:59.113 --> 01:42:00.505
-I was in the shower.
-Yeah.

01:42:00.549 --> 01:42:02.116
She's playing soccer
in the courtyard.

01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:04.944
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:42:04.988 --> 01:42:07.121
-Oh, that's all right.
-It...

01:42:07.164 --> 01:42:09.514
Don't you want to ask me
about my first day at work?

01:42:09.558 --> 01:42:11.125
Uh, yeah, yeah. How'd it go?

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.003
-

01:42:29.230 --> 01:42:31.188
-Bill?
-Hmm?

01:42:31.232 --> 01:42:33.495
Who is the man in the cave?

01:42:36.628 --> 01:42:37.847
In the cave?

01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:40.719
With the tools.

01:42:40.763 --> 01:42:42.808
I saw him.

01:42:48.684 --> 01:42:51.730
Um, I'm gonna need your help.

01:42:51.774 --> 01:42:53.819
Okay?

01:42:53.863 --> 01:42:56.822
'Cause it's a secret.

01:42:56.866 --> 01:42:59.564
You can't tell anyone.

01:42:59.608 --> 01:43:01.000
Even your mom.

01:43:01.044 --> 01:43:02.611
Okay?

01:43:04.265 --> 01:43:06.180
He's a bad man.

01:43:06.223 --> 01:43:08.747
He'll be gone soon.

01:43:09.879 --> 01:43:11.837
It's gonna be our secret.

01:43:11.881 --> 01:43:13.578
Okay?

01:43:17.321 --> 01:43:19.541
That's my girl.

01:45:20.836 --> 01:45:22.185
:
Shit.

01:45:53.347 --> 01:45:55.349
ALLISON: I learned
something new actually.

01:45:56.393 --> 01:45:58.830
It's helped me a lot.

01:45:58.874 --> 01:46:01.442
It's something called
the "Mektub."

01:46:01.485 --> 01:46:04.488
A nurse told me about it.

01:46:04.532 --> 01:46:06.011
It's about acceptance.

01:46:06.055 --> 01:46:08.362
Acceptance of what?

01:46:09.406 --> 01:46:10.973
Your fate.

01:46:12.366 --> 01:46:15.107
It's helping me
to stop struggling so much.

01:46:15.151 --> 01:46:17.414
Stop questioning everything.

01:46:19.111 --> 01:46:22.376
You just embrace your fate

01:46:22.419 --> 01:46:24.378
and learn to live in peace
with it.

01:46:26.075 --> 01:46:28.425
It's a Muslim idea.

01:46:28.469 --> 01:46:30.471
It's about...

01:46:30.514 --> 01:46:33.430
letting go of all of that...

01:46:35.911 --> 01:46:37.260
...shame...

01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:42.221
...and guilt
that pushes you down

01:46:42.265 --> 01:46:44.398
and keeps you down

01:46:44.441 --> 01:46:48.184
and makes you feel
so powerless.

01:46:49.141 --> 01:46:51.970
And that's how I felt
for a really long time.

01:46:55.060 --> 01:46:57.106
Powerless and forgotten.

01:46:59.325 --> 01:47:01.240
And...

01:47:01.284 --> 01:47:04.243
that makes living really hard.

01:47:05.244 --> 01:47:07.290
You know what I mean?

01:47:10.511 --> 01:47:13.122
But you're innocent.

01:47:14.428 --> 01:47:16.865
So we got to keep fighting.

01:47:16.908 --> 01:47:19.955
It doesn't matter
that I'm innocent, Dad.

01:47:21.217 --> 01:47:23.262
It's not about justice.

01:47:25.613 --> 01:47:28.050
It's about finding peace.

01:48:06.088 --> 01:48:07.872
I don't know
what you're saying,

01:48:07.916 --> 01:48:09.918
but you're wasting your breath.

01:48:09.961 --> 01:48:14.531
We're gonna wait for that DNA,
and then we'll know.

01:48:14.575 --> 01:48:17.926
She ask me. She pay me.

01:48:17.969 --> 01:48:19.362
You want more water?

01:48:19.405 --> 01:48:22.496
Allison, she say,
"Go. You put Lina out."

01:48:22.539 --> 01:48:23.497
-That's enough, now.
-"Money for you."

01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:25.368
That's enough, now.

01:48:25.411 --> 01:48:27.588
She tell me take it.

01:48:27.631 --> 01:48:29.154
She gave me collier.

01:48:29.198 --> 01:48:30.286
"You take it.

01:48:30.329 --> 01:48:31.983
-Money after."
-Here.

01:48:32.027 --> 01:48:33.507
Drink that.

01:48:33.550 --> 01:48:34.899
Go on.

01:48:36.031 --> 01:48:38.250
Un collier.
"You take it for you."

01:48:38.294 --> 01:48:40.426
Collier.Gold.

01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:43.212
Like this. Like this.

01:48:43.255 --> 01:48:45.519
The necklace?
I-I don't want that.

01:48:45.562 --> 01:48:47.477
No!

01:48:47.521 --> 01:48:48.870
She gave me.

01:48:48.913 --> 01:48:51.350
She say,
"Go. You put Lina out.

01:48:51.394 --> 01:48:54.310
Necklace now. Money after."

01:48:54.353 --> 01:48:56.007
You're not even making sense.

01:48:56.051 --> 01:48:57.574
Time to shut the fuck up.

01:48:57.618 --> 01:48:59.489
S-Stillwater!

01:49:03.449 --> 01:49:04.973
What'd you say?

01:49:05.016 --> 01:49:07.105
The collier.

01:49:07.149 --> 01:49:09.020
He say "Stillwater."

01:49:10.021 --> 01:49:11.893
Gold.

01:49:11.936 --> 01:49:13.938
She say...

01:49:14.939 --> 01:49:18.290
"Do it. Make her go.

01:49:18.334 --> 01:49:20.292
Make her go out."

01:49:39.616 --> 01:49:40.617
Hey.

01:49:40.661 --> 01:49:42.140
-Hey.
-Where were you?

01:49:42.184 --> 01:49:44.534
I walked back from
the, uh, Baumettes.

01:49:44.578 --> 01:49:46.536
We have to go and see Isabelle.

01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:48.016
We'll be late
if we don't leave now.

01:49:48.059 --> 01:49:51.367
Do, uh... do I have to go?

01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:53.064
Yes, of course.

01:49:53.108 --> 01:49:54.718
I told her you were coming.

01:49:54.762 --> 01:49:57.242
Hurry up, please. Maya...

01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:01.638
MAYA:
Oui, maman.

01:50:01.682 --> 01:50:03.727
VIRGINIE:
So, Isabelle is

01:50:03.771 --> 01:50:06.991
a sort of like godmother
for us.

01:50:07.035 --> 01:50:08.689
Maya really loves her.

01:50:09.690 --> 01:50:11.256
Well, you'll see.

01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:13.432
This is really
the other side of Marseille.

01:50:18.699 --> 01:50:20.222
MAYA:
Marraine!

01:50:20.265 --> 01:50:21.615
ISABELLE:
Ah.

01:50:49.730 --> 01:50:51.645
: I don't
know what you're talking about.

01:50:51.688 --> 01:50:54.386
BILL: The gold necklace
I gave her the day she left.

01:50:54.430 --> 01:50:56.214
Said "Stillwater" on it.

01:50:56.258 --> 01:50:58.129
Yeah, I remember it.
What about it?

01:50:58.173 --> 01:51:00.305
D-Do you remember, was
she wearing it at the trial?

01:51:00.349 --> 01:51:02.351
Did she still have it on?

01:51:02.394 --> 01:51:04.135
What are you getting into,
Bill?

01:51:04.179 --> 01:51:07.182
Wh-When we went to get
her stuff, did you see it?

01:51:07.225 --> 01:51:08.444
Oh, I don't know.

01:51:08.487 --> 01:51:10.359
I don't remember. Why?

01:51:10.402 --> 01:51:12.317
I'll talk to you later, Sharon.
Bye.

01:51:14.406 --> 01:51:16.321
VIRGINIE:
CÃ‡a va?

01:51:16.365 --> 01:51:18.280
Yeah. Yeah, Ã§a va.

01:51:19.324 --> 01:51:20.674
Uh, talking to Sharon.

01:51:20.717 --> 01:51:23.328
-Is she okay?
-Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

01:51:23.372 --> 01:51:24.503
Are you?

01:51:24.547 --> 01:51:26.505
What do you mean?

01:51:26.549 --> 01:51:29.291
You just seem distrait.

01:51:30.292 --> 01:51:32.555
I am. Sorry.

01:51:34.122 --> 01:51:35.514
I'm happy you're here.

01:51:36.690 --> 01:51:38.343
Me, too.

01:51:38.387 --> 01:51:40.650
You, too?

01:51:40.694 --> 01:51:42.652
Y-You're-you're happy
you're here?

01:51:42.696 --> 01:51:44.698
-I am.

01:51:45.742 --> 01:51:47.222
Really.

01:51:48.745 --> 01:51:50.312
Me, too.

01:51:51.792 --> 01:51:53.750
I like you, Bill Baker.

01:52:03.194 --> 01:52:04.413
Okay, come.

01:52:15.816 --> 01:52:17.556
-BILL: Mr. Dirosa,

01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:18.862
it's Bill Baker.

01:52:18.906 --> 01:52:21.343
Uh, really need that result.

01:52:21.386 --> 01:52:23.824
Uh, it's kind of urgent.

01:53:03.254 --> 01:53:05.126
DIROSA:
Bonjour, madame.

01:53:05.169 --> 01:53:06.301
Bonjour.

01:53:49.997 --> 01:53:51.172
Bonne journÃ©e.

01:53:51.215 --> 01:53:52.608
Au revoir.

01:54:15.587 --> 01:54:17.546
You know, I used to fight
a lot at school

01:54:17.589 --> 01:54:19.809
when I was a kid, too.

01:54:19.853 --> 01:54:22.856
But that's not good. Fight? No.

01:54:26.381 --> 01:54:28.426
You sure you don't want this?

01:54:29.906 --> 01:54:33.214
The man in the cave,
you will kill?

01:54:33.257 --> 01:54:35.216
What? No.

01:54:35.259 --> 01:54:36.826
Of course not.

01:54:42.832 --> 01:54:45.879
I would never, ever do anything
to hurt you or your mother.

01:54:45.922 --> 01:54:46.880
Never.

01:54:50.405 --> 01:54:52.276
Because I love both of you.

01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:53.887
So much.

01:54:54.931 --> 01:54:56.498
I do.

01:54:59.544 --> 01:55:01.677
You just have to trust me.

01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:02.896
Okay?

01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:07.248
Okay.

01:55:29.879 --> 01:55:32.534
Mr. Baker, a word please.

01:55:32.577 --> 01:55:34.318
Police.

01:55:34.362 --> 01:55:37.278
Can I see your I.D. please?

01:55:37.321 --> 01:55:39.367
Your I.D., Mr. Baker.

01:55:44.589 --> 01:55:45.982
Thank you.

01:55:46.026 --> 01:55:47.941
Take off your cap.

01:55:52.336 --> 01:55:54.556
Okay. Thank you.

01:55:56.079 --> 01:55:57.776
So, Mr. Baker, my colleagues

01:55:57.820 --> 01:55:59.604
are gonna take
the little girl inside.

01:55:59.648 --> 01:56:01.302
Okay?

01:56:01.345 --> 01:56:02.781
-No, Bill. -Okay, all right,
all right, all right.

01:56:02.825 --> 01:56:04.522
It's okay. It's all right.

01:56:04.566 --> 01:56:05.741
-You go with her.
-No.

01:56:05.784 --> 01:56:07.438
Tout va bien. Tout va bien.

01:56:07.482 --> 01:56:08.526
It's all right.

01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:12.791
You're all right.

01:56:12.835 --> 01:56:14.837
CAPTAIN:
So, Mr. Baker, look at me.

01:56:16.491 --> 01:56:18.841
Do you have a basement here?

01:56:20.843 --> 01:56:22.410
Yes or no?

01:56:23.889 --> 01:56:25.021
Yes, sir.

01:56:25.065 --> 01:56:27.632
Okay. Give me the keys please.

01:56:49.959 --> 01:56:51.004
CAPTAIN:
Please.

01:57:06.541 --> 01:57:08.412
Stop.

01:57:27.605 --> 01:57:29.085
Stop.

01:57:45.667 --> 01:57:46.929
Do you have the key?

01:57:47.930 --> 01:57:50.063
Mr. Baker.

01:57:50.106 --> 01:57:51.760
He's got it.

01:58:16.045 --> 01:58:18.743
CAPTAIN:
Let's go upstairs.

01:58:24.749 --> 01:58:26.534
DETECTIVE:
Sit.

01:58:58.914 --> 01:59:00.089
Viens.

01:59:03.527 --> 01:59:04.833
:
Vas-y, chÃ©rie.

01:59:19.848 --> 01:59:20.849
Oui.

01:59:24.287 --> 01:59:25.984
-Oui.
-Ah.

01:59:35.168 --> 01:59:36.517
Oui.

01:59:45.047 --> 01:59:46.222
Ah.

02:00:16.861 --> 02:00:18.036
-Non?
-Non.

02:00:19.647 --> 02:00:21.214
-Oui.
-Mm.

02:01:12.700 --> 02:01:13.918
Okay.

02:01:40.336 --> 02:01:41.685
Virginie, I didn't mean to...

02:01:41.729 --> 02:01:43.383
How did you find him?

02:01:45.254 --> 02:01:47.169
Pure chance.

02:01:47.212 --> 02:01:48.866
The soccer game.

02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:52.000
With Maya?

02:01:59.399 --> 02:02:01.314
Did you ask her to lie?

02:02:02.967 --> 02:02:04.665
Did you?

02:02:05.796 --> 02:02:08.321
I never meant
to involve you or Maya.

02:02:12.325 --> 02:02:14.022
-I know...
-You...

02:02:16.024 --> 02:02:17.721
You have to leave now.

02:02:21.246 --> 02:02:24.424
Okay. You pack your things,
you leave.

02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:39.352
May I come in?

02:02:45.227 --> 02:02:46.794
Maya?

02:02:52.234 --> 02:02:54.236
You don't want to talk to me?

02:02:55.542 --> 02:02:57.326
All right.

02:03:00.068 --> 02:03:01.765
I'm sorry.

02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:07.945
I'm so sorry.

02:03:14.256 --> 02:03:15.431
I love you.

02:03:48.159 --> 02:03:49.509
VIRGINIE:
Bill.

02:03:50.510 --> 02:03:51.772
MAYA:
Non.

02:04:45.478 --> 02:04:46.957
Mr. Baker,

02:04:47.001 --> 02:04:49.960
I've come with some
extraordinary news.

02:04:50.004 --> 02:04:52.354
The judge in your daughter's
case called me this morning.

02:04:52.397 --> 02:04:54.095
New evidence has surfaced.

02:04:54.138 --> 02:04:56.097
Apparently, a retired cop

02:04:56.140 --> 02:04:59.317
came up with a DNA match
on the unknown sample.

02:04:59.361 --> 02:05:02.320
It also matched
a sample the police collected

02:05:02.364 --> 02:05:04.192
on a burglary case
four years ago,

02:05:04.235 --> 02:05:06.194
after the trial.

02:05:06.237 --> 02:05:07.543
Did they catch him?

02:05:07.587 --> 02:05:10.024
No, not yet.

02:05:10.067 --> 02:05:13.462
But all we need to prove
is sufficient doubt.

02:05:13.506 --> 02:05:16.160
So even if they can't
find the suspect,

02:05:16.204 --> 02:05:18.336
there's a real chance
they will release Allison.

02:05:19.337 --> 02:05:21.557
In fact, the judge
has already agreed

02:05:21.601 --> 02:05:26.214
to reopen the investigation,
which is almost unheard of.

02:05:27.258 --> 02:05:29.565
I think this could only happen
in Marseille.

02:05:36.703 --> 02:05:39.227
Thank you for coming
to tell me, ma'am.

02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:43.013
Mr. Baker, this is
the best possible outcome

02:05:43.057 --> 02:05:44.537
for your family.

02:05:44.580 --> 02:05:46.060
Do you understand?

02:05:46.103 --> 02:05:48.018
I do.

02:05:49.063 --> 02:05:50.543
Thank you, ma'am.

02:06:16.090 --> 02:06:17.613
-MAN: Go, Pokes!

02:06:22.618 --> 02:06:24.707
I told you we were gonna
bring our girl home,

02:06:24.751 --> 02:06:27.188
and that's exactly what we did.

02:06:31.584 --> 02:06:33.455
Welcome home, Allison.

02:06:34.717 --> 02:06:36.371
Welcome back to Oklahoma.

02:06:37.720 --> 02:06:39.417
Welcome back to America!

02:07:07.707 --> 02:07:09.404
-

02:07:29.424 --> 02:07:31.165
You're being antisocial?

02:07:36.605 --> 02:07:38.215
You all right?

02:07:44.744 --> 02:07:48.486
The day you left for Marseille,

02:07:48.530 --> 02:07:51.489
Sharon and I drove you
to the airport, and...

02:07:51.533 --> 02:07:54.318
when we got there,

02:07:54.362 --> 02:07:57.626
I was embarrassed I didn't have
a present or nothing,

02:07:57.670 --> 02:08:00.629
so I went to the gift shop.

02:08:01.630 --> 02:08:05.286
I thought I'd get you a book
or a key chain or something.

02:08:06.374 --> 02:08:08.419
Then I saw this necklace.

02:08:10.334 --> 02:08:14.208
I thought it'd be like a little
piece of home to take with you.

02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:17.646
It was gold.

02:08:17.690 --> 02:08:19.561
Said "Stillwater" on it.

02:08:33.662 --> 02:08:36.578
:
I didn't want it to happen.

02:08:40.277 --> 02:08:42.540
He told me that
he would just help me

02:08:42.584 --> 02:08:44.760
get her out of the apartment,
that's all.

02:08:46.588 --> 02:08:49.156
I didn't want her to die.

02:08:50.766 --> 02:08:52.725
I loved her.

02:08:54.248 --> 02:08:56.380
I know you did.

02:08:58.252 --> 02:09:00.254
You think I'm a monster?

02:09:01.646 --> 02:09:02.778
You're my daughter.

02:09:02.822 --> 02:09:05.781
I... I could never think that.

02:09:08.697 --> 02:09:11.178
Dad, what is wrong with us?

02:09:14.442 --> 02:09:17.140
I don't know, baby girl.

02:09:17.184 --> 02:09:19.142
I don't know.

02:09:19.186 --> 02:09:21.492
:
I'm sorry.

02:09:21.536 --> 02:09:23.103
I'm so sorry.

02:09:24.539 --> 02:09:27.150
I'm sorry.

02:09:31.328 --> 02:09:32.852
Me, too.

02:10:17.897 --> 02:10:21.204
from my hair

02:10:23.772 --> 02:10:28.342
and let it fall

02:10:30.344 --> 02:10:33.869
against your skin

02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:39.875
on the wall...

02:10:46.926 --> 02:10:48.753
Morning.

02:10:48.797 --> 02:10:50.364
Hey.

02:10:53.019 --> 02:10:55.586
Couldn't sleep.

02:10:56.761 --> 02:10:59.416
Went for a walk, and...

02:10:59.460 --> 02:11:01.592
ended up here.

02:11:04.291 --> 02:11:05.858
I'm glad you did.

02:11:11.602 --> 02:11:13.343
You miss them?

02:11:17.434 --> 02:11:18.958
I do.

02:11:20.568 --> 02:11:21.917
Can you go back?

02:11:23.963 --> 02:11:25.747
No, I can't.

02:11:28.576 --> 02:11:30.491
But it was good.

02:11:30.534 --> 02:11:32.406
That don't change.

02:11:37.324 --> 02:11:38.891
:
I'm sorry.

02:11:41.850 --> 02:11:43.765
Life is brutal.

02:12:00.913 --> 02:12:03.437
Everything looks the same here.

02:12:05.787 --> 02:12:07.658
Nothing's changed.

02:12:09.747 --> 02:12:11.314
Don't you think?

02:12:15.318 --> 02:12:17.364
No, Ally, I don't.

02:12:19.670 --> 02:12:21.890
It all looks different to me.

02:12:23.805 --> 02:12:26.329
I don't hardly
recognize it anymore.
