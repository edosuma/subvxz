00:02.702 --> 00:05.068
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, Daniel, it's Betty.</i>

00:05.138 --> 00:08.505
- I need to talk to you about Sofia.
- Perfect timing! I proposed!

00:08.575 --> 00:10.805
- It was a lie.
- What are you talking about?

00:10.877 --> 00:14.210
Sofia set him up.
She used Daniel to get her cover story.

00:14.280 --> 00:17.215
"From Fling to Ring in 60 Days."

00:17.884 --> 00:20.478
Thank you for being such a good sport.

00:20.553 --> 00:25.320
I fully intend to take over the company
sooner rather than later.

00:25.392 --> 00:28.122
You manipulated me
and lied to my face about Daniel.

00:28.194 --> 00:29.525
I quit.

00:29.596 --> 00:32.121
- Where's Daniel?
- He disappeared.

Look, I know you're upset
about leaving that big New York job,

00:40.807 --> 00:43.298
but you have to eat something.

00:43.777 --> 00:47.372
I never should've taken that
stupid position at Sofia's magazine.

00:47.447 --> 00:49.005
<i>I should have stayed at Mode.</i>

00:49.082 --> 00:52.415
Yeah, Aunt Betty. I miss the swag.

00:55.121 --> 00:59.148
OK, is there a sign on my forehead
that says "Crap here"?

01:00.393 --> 01:03.521
- What's the matter with you?
- There's an Herbalux recall.

01:03.596 --> 01:08.260
They're pulling the products because
housewives in Secaucus lost their hair!

01:08.334 --> 01:10.598
Why don't they change
what's in the shampoo?

01:10.670 --> 01:12.604
They were using the hand cream.

01:12.672 --> 01:15.607
The FDA is recalling the whole line.

01:15.675 --> 01:18.235
- I don't have a job anymore!
- Are you serious?

01:18.311 --> 01:20.245
Maybe Oprah can adopt us.

01:20.313 --> 01:22.508
Wait a minute, I use that hand cream.

01:22.582 --> 01:26.143
What am I gonna do?
I have bills, car payments...

01:26.219 --> 01:28.551

01:31.624 --> 01:34.650

with the "When I left Mode."</i>

01:34.727 --> 01:38.219
OK, this is totally different!
Herbalux was all I had.

01:38.298 --> 01:40.266
You? You already have another job!

01:41.434 --> 01:44.460
Betty! That four top wants chips. Now!

01:49.509 --> 01:52.603
You're right.
Sometimes I forget how lucky I am.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.946
[Steve] I've got e-mails,
voice mails, phone records.

02:00.019 --> 02:01.953
And the location of the wrecked car.

02:02.021 --> 02:05.752
Everything you'd need to put Bradford
away for Fey Sommers' death.

02:05.825 --> 02:08.055
Oh, one million dollars.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.596
Do I look like I'm made of money?

02:10.663 --> 02:13.325
Frankly, lady, I don't know
what you look like,

02:13.399 --> 02:16.800
but that figure's non-negotiable.
Oh, and you've got 24 hours.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.830
Leaves a bit of a stench, doesn't he?

02:23.910 --> 02:26.640
- [Spraying]
- He has what we've been looking for.

02:26.713 --> 02:28.908
You do realize,
once I hand over the money,

02:28.982 --> 02:31.746
we need to be ready
for an immediate takeover.

Bald ain't gonna make
much of a difference!

02:59.879 --> 03:02.279
I don't think
you need another one of these.

03:02.348 --> 03:06.079
I'm done, I'm done.
Let's just go home.

03:06.152 --> 03:07.676
Can you help me fake a resume?

03:07.754 --> 03:09.813
I was planning on going into the city.

03:09.889 --> 03:11.686
Daniel's home from Rio tomorrow.

03:11.758 --> 03:14.989
I thought I could stock his fridge,
pick up his dry-cleaning.

03:15.061 --> 03:17.894
Why? You're not his assistant anymore.

03:17.964 --> 03:21.161
I just... This wouldn't
have happened if it wasn't for me.

03:21.234 --> 03:25.364
I pushed him to propose to Sofia.
I want to make coming home easy for him.

03:25.438 --> 03:27.201
Betty...

03:27.273 --> 03:29.503
...you're such a good person.

She's got an eye for vintage.

03:55.868 --> 03:58.200
I need her for the layouts. She stays.

03:58.738 --> 04:03.607

I am not sitting in Betty's old chair.

- I need a talented seamstress.
- Her work is impeccable.

04:14.587 --> 04:19.081
- I can't understand a word she says.
- "Have a crumpet, guvner?" So annoying.

04:19.158 --> 04:22.457
Then again, she's the only one
who knows my real measurements.

She's Daniel's girl.
What has she ever done for me?

- She leaves when he leaves.
- Right, but she could...

She's not loyal to him.

04:53.326 --> 04:56.124
She's just working
her way up the ladder.

04:56.863 --> 04:59.457
But until she proves
her loyalty to me...

05:00.900 --> 05:01.992

27:02.153 --> 27:05.213
- We don't have a town car now.
- It's fine, we'll hail a cab.

27:06.658 --> 27:09.491
We could walk.
I mean, it's a nice night.

27:09.561 --> 27:12.496
Not exactly in any rush to
get back to an empty apartment.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.596
- OK.
- Cool.

27:17.569 --> 27:20.333
- How'd you enjoy the dinner?
- I thought it was good.

27:20.405 --> 27:22.896
- The snails were pretty good.
- You liked them?

27:22.974 --> 27:24.669
Here. Have mine.

27:24.743 --> 27:27.337
- [Snails hitting pavement]
- Whoa.

27:27.412 --> 27:29.778
You know what?
I'm gonna buy you a slice.

27:29.848 --> 27:31.748
- Come on.
- I could do a slice.

27:35.587 --> 27:38.647
<i>[Masked Lady] Did our smelly friend
bring you the evidence?</i>

27:38.723 --> 27:40.953
I have it on my desk right now.

27:41.026 --> 27:45.292
Now all we need is someone
to deliver it to the police.

27:45.363 --> 27:48.924
Someone who is not
connected directly to you.

27:56.775 --> 28:00.802
[Wilhelmina] I assume these will end up
on my desk again this year?

28:00.879 --> 28:03.677
Doesn't hurt to apply, does it?

28:03.748 --> 28:05.978
Christina, as much
as I'd love to help you,

28:06.051 --> 28:10.249
there's only room for ten
up-and-coming designers for the show.

28:10.321 --> 28:11.413
Oh.

28:12.390 --> 28:14.756
This is...

28:14.826 --> 28:18.353
...somewhat, um... interesting.

28:18.930 --> 28:20.557
Really?

28:20.632 --> 28:24.568
Because, well, I did try something
that was a bit different, so...

28:24.636 --> 28:28.003
Last year your designs
were a bit too bohemian.

28:28.073 --> 28:30.405
Your exact words were "hippie hideous."

28:31.443 --> 28:33.968
It's not just about the designs.

28:34.045 --> 28:36.673
Christina, it's about the designer.

28:36.748 --> 28:40.184
- What do you mean?
- Don't be afraid of office politics.

28:40.251 --> 28:42.742
Do favors for the right people.

28:42.821 --> 28:44.914
You just might get rewarded at the end.

28:46.624 --> 28:49.923
Unfortunately, that is the cruel
reality in this business.

28:49.994 --> 28:53.395
OK, and you can stop right there.
I know how you work, Wilhelmina.

28:53.465 --> 28:59.426
- I'd rather make it on my own. Thanks.
- Admirable, but stupid.

29:00.905 --> 29:03.567
It's too bad.
Those were your best designs yet.

29:07.178 --> 29:09.976
But you are a wonderful seamstress.

29:23.595 --> 29:27.122
<i>[Man singing Volare]</i>

29:41.613 --> 29:43.137
You're thinking about her?

29:44.916 --> 29:49.285
You know you're in bad shape when a
tone-deaf, karaoke-singing truck driver

29:49.354 --> 29:53.415
- reminds you of your ex.
- I know this sounds weird, but...

29:53.491 --> 29:55.260
...I think, in some ways,
you're pretty lucky.

29:55.260 --> 29:56.056
...I think, in some ways,
you're pretty lucky.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.755
I am curious to hear
where you're going with this.

29:58.830 --> 30:01.663
You opened your heart,
you put yourself out there.

30:01.733 --> 30:04.258
You were ready to make that leap.

30:04.335 --> 30:07.361
- Betty, come on, really...
- I mean it. I'm envious.

30:07.438 --> 30:09.406
I wish I knew what that felt like,

30:09.474 --> 30:13.911
to find someone who makes you want to
swim across the East River in January.

30:13.978 --> 30:16.572
- Yeah, but don't you have that with...
- Walter.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.981
Oh, no, I'm talking about Henry,
the guy from Accounting.

30:20.051 --> 30:23.316
No, no, no, he doesn't
think about me that way.

30:23.388 --> 30:26.050
Are you serious?
I've seen the way he looks at you.

30:26.124 --> 30:30.185
Believe me, I know that look.
He's totally into you.

30:30.261 --> 30:33.094
- [Singing stops]
- [Scattered applause]

30:33.164 --> 30:37.100
- [Man] Number 34, you're up.
- Oh, wipe your mouth, that's us!

30:37.168 --> 30:39.864
What're you talking about?
Did you sign us up?

30:39.938 --> 30:41.929
It's half off if you sing.

30:42.740 --> 30:44.731
Yeah, but I'm rich!

- What time is it?
- 5:00 AM.

32:36.788 --> 32:40.349
Check it out, $180!

32:40.425 --> 32:43.553
And the best part is,
they doubled our order for tomorrow!

32:43.628 --> 32:47.029
We are officially "in"
with the Roosevelt Diner!

32:47.098 --> 32:50.727
$180? Let me run
the numbers by you, Hilda.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.327
Materials, ingredients, the new mixer.

32:53.404 --> 32:57.340
This little money-making scheme,
so far, has set us back $230.

32:58.443 --> 33:01.810
We are investing in our future.

33:02.313 --> 33:06.511
Grandma Suarez's future
involves a pillow and a blanket.

33:06.584 --> 33:10.918
No, no, no, you cannot quit on me now.
I need this to work.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.355
I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'm exhausted.

33:14.292 --> 33:16.385
Fine. Fine. You know what?

33:16.461 --> 33:20.659
- I will make the cupcakes myself.
- If you believe you can do it...

33:21.265 --> 33:22.926
I believe you can do it.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.265
That green thing...

33:25.336 --> 33:27.167
That's the oven.

33:33.711 --> 33:35.679
Is it hot?

33:36.614 --> 33:39.174
I've never crashed
a wedding reception before.

33:39.250 --> 33:42.742
- What an amazing way to get free cake!
- And bridesmaids.

33:42.820 --> 33:45.755
That blonde chick was into you.
You have to call her.

33:45.823 --> 33:48.223
Promise me that you're gonna call her.

33:48.292 --> 33:51.056
- I'll say "boobs" again.
- All right, we'll see.

33:51.129 --> 33:53.120
Maybe. Wow.

33:54.899 --> 33:58.096
I'm not used to seeing the city
from across the river.

33:58.169 --> 34:01.627
Really? It's the only way
I've ever seen it.

34:01.706 --> 34:05.164
Wow. It's almost as good as a blizzard.

34:06.677 --> 34:08.338
What do you mean?

34:08.413 --> 34:13.146
You know, when the city stops,
and there's this silence and...

34:13.217 --> 34:16.014
...everything kind of sparkles.

34:18.589 --> 34:22.855
Next time I can't sleep, I'm coming
right back to this exact spot.

34:22.927 --> 34:25.554
5:00 AM, I'll be on this bridge.

34:25.630 --> 34:27.791
Call me, I'll meet you.

34:32.402 --> 34:35.201
You know, my brother used to do that.

34:35.273 --> 34:37.503
Stay up partying all night,

34:38.275 --> 34:42.507
then find some after-hours in Chinatown,
call me and tell me to meet him there.

34:45.149 --> 34:48.175
You don't really
talk about him very much.

34:48.252 --> 34:51.880
I guess I don't really think of
Alex as being gone.

34:55.659 --> 34:58.959
More like he's on some
endless trip around the world.

35:00.565 --> 35:03.625
- How did he...
- Jumped out of a helicopter...

35:04.535 --> 35:06.969
...to ski down Mount Juno.

35:08.206 --> 35:09.935
He found chair lifts tedious.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.271
Well, I bet you really miss him.

35:16.514 --> 35:18.982
At least he died the way he lived.

35:21.152 --> 35:23.848
If there was no risk involved,
Alex wasn't into it.

35:27.692 --> 35:31.219
So... What's stopping you
from going after this Henry guy, hmm?

35:31.996 --> 35:35.625
Oh, God, please, Daniel,
it's not worth talking about.

35:35.700 --> 35:38.260
Why not?

35:38.336 --> 35:42.397
I don't feel like competing with a model
who weighs less than my shoes.

35:42.473 --> 35:45.465
- What model?
- Aerin.

35:47.311 --> 35:49.905
He kissed her at the
Christmas party. I saw them.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.312
- Aerin?
- Your ex.

35:51.382 --> 35:53.179
That's who you're worried about?

35:53.251 --> 35:55.913
She must have kissed
six other guys that night.

35:55.987 --> 35:59.388
For her, it's like saying,
"Where's my coat?"

35:59.457 --> 36:02.187
Yeah, well,
it didn't look that way to me.

36:02.260 --> 36:04.728
Fine, you can make
excuses if you want, but...

36:06.264 --> 36:08.494
...you're better than any model, Betty.

36:09.367 --> 36:11.801
Much better.

36:31.289 --> 36:34.315
Eggs, eggs, eggs... I need eggs.

36:34.992 --> 36:36.823
I need more milk!

- I never went down. I have a big order.

36:43.201 --> 36:46.364
- Where were you?
- All over. Brooklyn, mostly.

36:46.437 --> 36:48.234
- With who?
- Daniel.

36:48.306 --> 36:51.901
We met for dinner, the food sucked,
so we had pizza, then we hung out.

36:51.976 --> 36:53.443
Are you insane?

36:54.712 --> 36:56.976
You went on an all-night date
with your boss?

36:57.048 --> 36:58.572
No, it wasn't a date.

36:58.649 --> 37:01.277
First, you set your sights
on a guy in Accounting,

37:01.352 --> 37:04.344
and now a man whose wristwatch
costs more than our house.

37:04.422 --> 37:06.788
It was a business dinner.
And you know what?

37:06.857 --> 37:09.189
Some people think it's OK
for me to aim high.

37:10.828 --> 37:14.696
- What's that smell?
- Oh, my God!

37:14.765 --> 37:17.256
Oh, I can't believe this!

37:17.335 --> 37:19.360
The timer never went off!

37:20.238 --> 37:22.570
- Do you have a clean pan? I can...
- Forget it!

37:22.640 --> 37:25.973
I can't even make
a freaking batch of cupcakes!

37:27.812 --> 37:30.474
I'm 30 years old,
I got no employable skills!

37:30.548 --> 37:34.040
- Everyone went to college, I had a kid!
- What are you trying to say?

37:34.118 --> 37:37.212
I don't know.
Look, don't get me wrong.

37:37.288 --> 37:38.619
Justin...

37:38.689 --> 37:42.523
Justin is the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

37:44.528 --> 37:46.359
But, sometimes,

37:46.430 --> 37:48.898
I can't help but wonder what my life

37:48.966 --> 37:51.833
- would've been like if I'd never...
- Hilda, stop it.

37:52.970 --> 37:54.767
You are an amazing mother.

37:56.507 --> 37:57.997
Great.

37:58.576 --> 38:01.101
How much does that pay an hour?

38:01.612 --> 38:04.206
You're just going through
a transition period.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.682
You needed this change.

38:06.751 --> 38:09.879
You're going to come out
the other side better than ever.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.307
- Gotcha!
- Betty, hey!

38:37.982 --> 38:40.610
- What are you doing here?
- We're done with this.

38:40.685 --> 38:42.550
You can't take the stairs forever.

38:46.390 --> 38:49.985
Don't be so smug. I'm not the only one
who's trying to avoid someone.

38:51.062 --> 38:54.395
You know, I don't think
I want to avoid him anymore.

a seamstress her whole life...

...what exactly would she have to do?

39:54.525 --> 39:56.254
Anonymously.

Did you put it in the men's room again?

40:13.611 --> 40:15.579
You don't need it anymore.

40:15.646 --> 40:19.207
- This is your desk.
- What?

40:19.283 --> 40:22.411
Betty, it doesn't matter
if you're sitting on a chair,

40:22.486 --> 40:24.886
or a stool, or a donkey.

40:25.856 --> 40:28.882

His only one.

- Yeah.

40:36.133 --> 40:38.328
is that we both want
what's best for you.

40:38.402 --> 40:40.267
I'd really like my old job back.

40:40.337 --> 40:43.465

40:43.541 --> 40:46.271
Well... OK.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.542
That sounds fair.

Oh, and when you're done getting
settled, I would love a bagel.
