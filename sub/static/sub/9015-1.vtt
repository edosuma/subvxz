You're Watching 123Movies.to

00:22.000 --> 00:23.727
This is something
everybody should see.

00:23.729 --> 00:25.297
Aw, come on,
take those off,

00:25.299 --> 00:27.866
would ya?

00:27.868 --> 00:30.067
This is so cool.

00:30.069 --> 00:32.637
Look. Look at that.

00:32.639 --> 00:35.106
You see? You see the guy
with the goofy hair?

00:35.108 --> 00:39.143
That's
Thomas Jefferson.

00:39.145 --> 00:40.644
Originally, he was
supposed to be

00:40.646 --> 00:42.280
on the other side
of Washington,

00:42.282 --> 00:43.747
but they
screwed it up,

00:43.749 --> 00:45.250
so they had to
blow his face off

00:45.252 --> 00:46.851
with dynamite.

00:46.853 --> 00:48.085
Cool.

00:48.087 --> 00:49.219
Did they ever
parkour it?

00:49.221 --> 00:51.790
Nah. Only
in the movies.

00:51.792 --> 00:55.960
"North By Northwest."
Classic Hitchcock.

00:55.962 --> 00:58.896
Aw, come on.
"Hitchcock."

00:58.898 --> 01:00.932
The director?
Alfred Hitchcock!

01:00.934 --> 01:06.337
Big, fat guy,...
fatter than your Uncle Ted.

01:12.078 --> 01:14.915
Do you hear that?

01:16.616 --> 01:18.351
Look! Up there!

01:24.223 --> 01:25.956
Man, look at that!

01:25.958 --> 01:27.025
Whoa!

01:41.408 --> 01:43.641
Walter, get me data from VRM4

01:43.643 --> 01:46.076
and reposition
the space weather satellites

01:46.078 --> 01:47.311
from its polar orbit.

01:47.313 --> 01:49.914
I want to know why
we didn't see this coming.

01:49.916 --> 01:52.349
Sir? We could bring
A.L.A.T. online.

01:52.351 --> 01:54.385
You know damn well

01:54.387 --> 01:56.021
why that satellite
was decommissioned.

01:56.023 --> 01:58.423
Adams! Where's the feed
from Helios 2B?

01:58.425 --> 02:00.992
We need to see
what they're seeing!

02:00.994 --> 02:03.227
And where the hell
is that line to N.O.R.A.D.?

02:03.229 --> 02:04.396
Sir!

02:04.398 --> 02:05.897
We have projected
trajectories

02:05.899 --> 02:07.866
on three of
the largest meteoroids.

02:07.868 --> 02:09.299
The rest won't survive entry.

02:09.300 --> 02:12.269
Estimated impact...
30 minutes.

02:30.090 --> 02:32.390
I want a public alert.

02:32.392 --> 02:33.357
Alert for what?

02:33.359 --> 02:36.428
Whatever gets people indoors
and under cover.

02:36.430 --> 02:39.297
I want a high alert for
the Pacific Northwest.

02:39.299 --> 02:42.069
Now.

02:54.047 --> 02:55.747
<i>The International Space Program</i>

02:55.749 --> 02:56.748

I feel horrible,

04:03.216 --> 04:05.784
because I'm hungover,
big brother.

04:05.786 --> 04:08.386
Well, you're not getting
any sympathy from me.

04:08.388 --> 04:09.987
I don't want sympathy.

04:18.732 --> 04:20.564
<i>...The "Asteroid Location

04:20.565 --> 04:21.600

04:24.003 --> 04:26.136
You know, for a patriot,
you look like a terrorist.

04:26.138 --> 04:27.571
<i>Classified documents

What is this? Quiche?

04:41.854 --> 04:43.955
It's crustless.

04:43.957 --> 04:47.859
Doesn't that
make it an omelet?

04:47.861 --> 04:49.561
Why do I bother?

04:49.563 --> 04:50.895
Why do you bother?

04:50.897 --> 04:52.864
Because you needed
a place to stay,

04:52.866 --> 04:54.598
and I was good enough
to give you one.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.201
That's why you bother.

04:56.203 --> 04:57.335
Just a little reminder,

04:57.337 --> 04:58.569
this was
Mom and Dad's place,

04:58.571 --> 05:00.571
and they left it
to both of us.

05:00.573 --> 05:03.208
Speaking
of moving in...

05:03.210 --> 05:07.110
you talk to Maggie?

05:07.112 --> 05:08.648
No.

05:10.183 --> 05:11.549
That's okay.

05:11.551 --> 05:14.251
Just try not
to cramp my style

05:14.253 --> 05:15.420
while you're here.

05:15.422 --> 05:16.386
Oh! Your style?

05:16.388 --> 05:17.388
Yeah.

05:17.390 --> 05:19.624
Like, say if I wanted
to bring a girl home.

05:19.626 --> 05:21.158
Oh! A girl, huh?

05:21.160 --> 05:22.593
- What? That's funny to you?
- Uh-huh.

05:22.595 --> 05:24.561
Because it almost
happened last night.

05:24.563 --> 05:25.896
You should've
seen this girl.

05:25.898 --> 05:28.066
She was gorgeous.

05:28.068 --> 05:29.234
And smart!

05:29.236 --> 05:31.001
And...

05:31.003 --> 05:33.339
And?

05:36.876 --> 05:38.376
I think
she was a reporter.

05:38.378 --> 05:39.477
You "think" she was?

05:39.479 --> 05:40.444
No, no. I'm actually...

05:40.446 --> 05:42.547
I'm actually pretty sure
she was a reporter.

05:42.549 --> 05:43.948
Look, I know
we're not supposed

05:43.950 --> 05:45.617
to talk to the press,
but you're famous,

05:45.619 --> 05:47.451
and if I don't use that
to pick up girls,

05:47.453 --> 05:48.518
then what good is it?

05:48.520 --> 05:50.355
What did
you tell her?

05:50.357 --> 05:51.622
I don't remember,

05:51.624 --> 05:53.290
but I'm sure
it wasn't bad.

05:53.292 --> 05:54.525
Come on!
You know me!

05:54.527 --> 05:55.626
I'm a vault.

05:55.628 --> 05:57.996
Did I mention
she was gorgeous?

05:57.998 --> 06:00.230
Come on.
It won't happen again.

06:00.232 --> 06:02.135
I'm sorry.

06:03.636 --> 06:06.203
I gotta go.

06:06.205 --> 06:09.506
Don't forget to take out
the garbage.

06:09.508 --> 06:12.309
Okay, so now we're mad?

06:23.088 --> 06:23.987
Hey.

06:23.989 --> 06:25.489
I thought you two
might like a coffee.

06:25.491 --> 06:26.691
It's a new Columbian
free-trade roast

06:26.693 --> 06:27.691
I picked up.

06:27.693 --> 06:28.826
Mr. Thomas.

06:28.828 --> 06:30.595
Please, you guys have
been tailing me for three weeks.

06:30.597 --> 06:32.597
I figure we should be
on a first-name basis.

06:32.599 --> 06:34.264
Mr. Thomas, we don't
want your coffee.

06:34.266 --> 06:35.668
I do.

06:45.412 --> 06:46.511
I'm gonna head
to my house now.

06:46.513 --> 06:49.483
I'll try not to run
any red lights on the way over.

06:54.087 --> 06:56.586
Mm! That's good.

06:56.588 --> 06:58.456
It's good coffee.

06:58.458 --> 07:00.458
Shut up,
Douglas.

07:05.164 --> 07:07.500
Are they ever
going to leave us alone?

07:09.268 --> 07:11.501
It's nothing
a little paint won't fix.

07:11.503 --> 07:13.670
Okay? It'll sell quick.

07:13.672 --> 07:15.239
You'll see.

07:15.241 --> 07:16.073
Yeah. I doubt it.

07:16.075 --> 07:17.641
My dad's the biggest
whistle-blower

07:17.643 --> 07:18.710
since Snowden.

07:18.712 --> 07:20.311
People hate him.

07:20.313 --> 07:21.446
They hate us!

07:21.448 --> 07:24.351
Hey.
Not everybody.

07:36.662 --> 07:39.597
Ah. You are still
being harassed.

07:39.599 --> 07:42.266
Yeah, your tax dollars
hard at work.

07:42.268 --> 07:43.600
Wow...

07:43.602 --> 07:45.203
the yard looks empty

07:45.205 --> 07:47.405
without all those
reporters camping out.

07:47.407 --> 07:48.739
Hey. What happened?

07:48.741 --> 07:49.773
Uh, it's nothing.

07:49.775 --> 07:51.576
Kyle got in
a fight at school.

07:51.578 --> 07:52.744
Again?

07:52.746 --> 07:54.211
Again? How many times
has this happened?

07:54.213 --> 07:55.312
Mom.

07:55.314 --> 07:56.280
Too many.

07:56.282 --> 07:57.581
The sooner
we sell this house

07:57.583 --> 07:59.417
and get out of town,
the better.

07:59.419 --> 08:01.752
Look, I...
I can take care of myself. Okay?

08:01.754 --> 08:04.088
I'm sorry, bud.

08:04.090 --> 08:05.756
The real
estate agent

08:05.758 --> 08:08.759
said she'd be here
by now, so...

08:08.761 --> 08:10.395
How was dinner
with nosey Nora?

08:10.397 --> 08:11.629
Hey! Don't call her that.

08:11.631 --> 08:13.196
Okay, my sister cares.

08:13.198 --> 08:16.033
I care.

08:16.035 --> 08:18.502
Really? Do you?

08:18.504 --> 08:19.670
I'm not invisible.

08:19.672 --> 08:21.571
Of course,
you're not, honey.

08:21.573 --> 08:23.641
You're not supposed to fight
in front of your children.

08:23.643 --> 08:24.475
It's, like, "Parenting 101."

08:24.477 --> 08:26.210
- We're not fighting.
- Yeah, we are.

08:26.212 --> 08:28.112
No, we're not.
We're discussing.

08:28.114 --> 08:29.480
Well, hey.
If we're "discussing,"

08:29.482 --> 08:31.516
then let's talk about
not selling the house.

08:31.518 --> 08:33.818
Sweetheart...

08:37.389 --> 08:39.625
Is this your agent?

08:42.561 --> 08:44.795
No.

08:44.797 --> 08:47.098
Steve Thomas, it is
an honor to meet you.

08:47.100 --> 08:48.299
I'm Sandra Gibbons.

08:48.301 --> 08:49.833
Oh! Kyle Thomas.

08:49.835 --> 08:50.834
You're the youngest scientist

08:50.836 --> 08:53.136
to compete in
the U.I.A.F. rocket competition.

08:53.138 --> 08:54.237
I really enjoyed
your article

08:54.239 --> 08:56.174
on how technology
represents

08:56.176 --> 08:58.543
the biggest threat
to civil liberties.

08:58.545 --> 08:59.709
It was great!

08:59.711 --> 09:00.777
And you are?

09:00.779 --> 09:03.747
I'm a reporter for
the Wyman University newspaper.

09:03.749 --> 09:06.583
Okay, please don't
talk to my son.

09:06.585 --> 09:08.586
I'm sorry, Mr. Thomas,

09:08.588 --> 09:11.555
but if I could just have
a few minutes of your time...

09:11.557 --> 09:13.591
No interviews.
Please get off my property.

09:13.593 --> 09:14.758
I'm a friend
of Bill's.

09:14.760 --> 09:16.227
He said that if
I mentioned his name,

09:16.229 --> 09:17.562
that you would
talk to me.

09:17.564 --> 09:19.197
Bill?

09:19.199 --> 09:21.165
He told you
I was gonna be here?

09:21.167 --> 09:23.568
He's a nice guy,
really nice.

09:23.570 --> 09:24.734
I met him just...

09:24.736 --> 09:27.838
At the bar,
last night.

09:32.579 --> 09:34.344
<i>This is the emergency
broadcast system...</i>

09:34.346 --> 09:35.612
Tornado?

09:35.614 --> 09:39.851
<i>...This is not a test.
Repeat. This is not a test.</i>

09:39.853 --> 09:42.587
This isn't tornado weather.

09:45.591 --> 09:48.159
You know why
I have a television?

09:48.161 --> 09:50.261
Can't say that I do.

09:50.263 --> 09:52.229
I want to watch <i>Bonanza,</i>

09:52.231 --> 09:55.198
but instead
I had to purchase

09:55.200 --> 09:56.601
"bundled channels."

09:56.603 --> 09:58.202
Now I got
entire stations

09:58.204 --> 10:00.872
dedicated
to chopping vegetables.

10:00.874 --> 10:03.207
Yeah. I feel your pain.

10:03.209 --> 10:05.142
Hey, you want me
to hold the ladder?

10:05.144 --> 10:06.810
Nah, I'm all right.

10:09.715 --> 10:12.216
You hear that?

10:12.218 --> 10:14.788
Can't hear a damn thing.

10:21.860 --> 10:25.262
Oh! Oh, ho, ho...

10:25.264 --> 10:27.433
What the hell
was that?

10:28.768 --> 10:30.904
It's a meteor shower.

10:32.638 --> 10:33.939
Get down!

10:38.545 --> 10:40.343
Everyone okay?

10:40.345 --> 10:41.212
You okay?

10:41.214 --> 10:45.248
Yeah. That was close.

10:45.250 --> 10:47.318
I'm going to go take a look.

10:47.320 --> 10:48.519
Okay.

11:04.537 --> 11:07.371
This is so cool.

11:07.373 --> 11:08.673
Be careful,
though.

11:08.675 --> 11:11.472
Keep your distance.

11:15.348 --> 11:17.348
Well, how big do you think?

11:17.350 --> 11:19.852
Size of a football, maybe.

11:20.887 --> 11:21.953
We were lucky.

11:21.955 --> 11:22.953
Dr. Thomas?

11:22.955 --> 11:24.955
The warning said tornado.

11:24.957 --> 11:26.958
Why weren't we notified earlier?

11:26.960 --> 11:28.258
I don't know.

11:28.260 --> 11:29.227
Do you think there
are more coming?

11:29.229 --> 11:30.660
Hard to say,
but the odds

11:30.662 --> 11:33.500
of another one landing anywhere
near here are pretty slim.

11:37.570 --> 11:38.703
Hey, you okay?

11:38.705 --> 11:40.371
Kinda.

11:40.373 --> 11:44.407
I think I sprained my tailbone.
Is that a thing?

11:44.409 --> 11:46.243
You there
with Kyle and Maggie?

11:46.245 --> 11:47.545
<i>Yeah. They're fine.</i>

11:47.547 --> 11:50.481
So is
your little reporter friend.

11:50.483 --> 11:51.982
<i>She's there?</i>

11:51.984 --> 11:54.751
Uh-uh, she is.

11:54.753 --> 11:56.253
She's drop-dead gorgeous,
right?

11:56.255 --> 11:58.757
I gotta go.

12:00.493 --> 12:01.525
Is Bill okay?

12:01.527 --> 12:04.628
He's good.

12:04.630 --> 12:07.732
Listen, I need your help.

12:07.734 --> 12:09.299
Hmm.

12:09.301 --> 12:11.804
And I need an interview.

12:13.538 --> 12:16.909
Stay back.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.049
Be careful, Dad.

12:24.550 --> 12:26.284
It's clean.

12:26.286 --> 12:28.922
No radiation.

12:44.870 --> 12:46.304
Wow...

12:46.306 --> 12:47.938
A real-life meteorite.

12:47.940 --> 12:50.006
Just looks like
an ordinary rock.

12:50.008 --> 12:52.044
Doesn't look
ordinary to me.

12:53.879 --> 12:56.514
Okay, where are you...

12:56.516 --> 12:57.982
If you're going to dissect
that in the house...

12:57.984 --> 12:59.317
I'll clean up my mess.

12:59.319 --> 13:00.483
Okay, 'cause
the real estate agent's

13:00.485 --> 13:01.452
gonna be here any minute.

13:01.454 --> 13:04.021
Dr. Thomas, why didn't
it burn up on entry?

13:04.023 --> 13:05.923
Well, it did, sort of.

13:05.925 --> 13:07.525
The Earth is constantly

13:07.527 --> 13:09.760
bombarded by meteors
all the time.

13:09.762 --> 13:12.429
About 90% burn off
on entry.

13:12.431 --> 13:15.766
The entry velocity puts
so much pressure on the object,

13:15.768 --> 13:17.601
that it causes it to fragment.

13:17.603 --> 13:19.402
You're a smart kid.

13:19.404 --> 13:22.707
Hey, I'm not a kid.
I'm 16.

13:22.709 --> 13:23.774
Okay.

13:23.776 --> 13:25.543
He's got
an I.Q. of 154.

13:25.545 --> 13:29.579
Wow.
Like father like son.

13:39.591 --> 13:42.093
Our preliminary calculations
indicate

13:42.095 --> 13:46.130
that it'll be confined
to the northern latitudes.

13:46.132 --> 13:48.998
Sir, we don't know
what this is.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.135
This is unprecedented.

13:51.137 --> 13:52.069
No, sir.

13:52.071 --> 13:56.008
We still haven't been able
to locate GX210.

13:57.576 --> 14:00.111
Yes, sir, a media blackout
is a good idea

14:00.113 --> 14:03.546
until we have the answers.

14:03.548 --> 14:07.117
I'll make a statement
to deflect. Agreed.

14:07.119 --> 14:09.923
Yes, sir,
I'll keep you posted.

14:11.858 --> 14:14.791
Case?

14:14.793 --> 14:16.993
I want all satellites
that still have eyes

14:16.995 --> 14:18.228
redirected,

14:18.230 --> 14:20.631
and I want operational status
on those that were damaged.

14:20.633 --> 14:22.902
Okay.

14:31.710 --> 14:33.743
Hmm.

14:33.745 --> 14:34.812
That's interesting.

14:34.814 --> 14:36.182
What?

14:38.017 --> 14:39.817
Look
at the texture.

14:39.819 --> 14:41.751
It's almost...

14:41.753 --> 14:43.756
zero porosity.

14:45.957 --> 14:48.525
I've never seen
anything like it.

14:48.527 --> 14:50.194
Steve, you're gonna
want to see this.

14:50.196 --> 14:51.495
<i>The asteroid GX210</i>

14:51.497 --> 14:52.829
<i>was being tracked</i>

14:52.831 --> 14:54.899
<i>by the International
Satellite Program</i>

14:54.901 --> 14:56.099
<i>when it suddenly disappeared.</i>

14:56.101 --> 14:58.902
<i>Did the meteor storm
have anything to do with GX210?</i>

14:58.904 --> 15:01.771
<i>I can't answer
that question at this time.</i>

15:01.773 --> 15:04.107
<i>We're still in the process of
investigating this phenomenon.</i>

15:04.109 --> 15:06.644
<i>This phenomenon,
as you call it,</i>

15:06.646 --> 15:08.612
<i>killed 12 Americans
and injured dozens more.</i>

15:08.614 --> 15:11.048
<i>What assurance can you give us
that this won't happen again?</i>

15:11.050 --> 15:13.016
<i>This won't
happen again.</i>

15:13.018 --> 15:14.517
<i>You're evading the question.</i>

15:14.519 --> 15:16.620
<i>And you, ma'am,
are fear-mongering.</i>

15:16.622 --> 15:19.055
<i>I have nothing further
to say at this mom...</i>

15:19.057 --> 15:21.625
Wow, he's arrogant.

15:21.627 --> 15:24.627
And he's
hiding something.

15:24.629 --> 15:26.630
I need
a strong microscope.

15:26.632 --> 15:28.466
I'm going to go to the lab.

15:28.468 --> 15:30.568
Your lab
is on lock-down.

15:30.570 --> 15:31.836
Someone
will let me in.

15:31.838 --> 15:33.102
Who?

15:33.104 --> 15:35.139
You alienated
everybody you know

15:35.141 --> 15:36.740
with your little
whistle-blowing stunt.

15:39.744 --> 15:41.981
You stay.

15:43.782 --> 15:46.118
I can get you into
a lab at the university.

15:47.186 --> 15:48.218
Yeah?

15:48.220 --> 15:49.987
It's fully loaded.

15:49.989 --> 15:51.722
Maggie,
I am so sorry I'm late.

15:51.724 --> 15:54.157
I was on my way over here
when the meteor storm hit.

15:54.159 --> 15:55.159
I know, we saw.

15:55.161 --> 15:57.862
Goodness, wasn't that
just the scariest thing?

15:57.864 --> 16:01.832
Um, Steve, this is Roberta,
our real estate agent.

16:01.834 --> 16:05.236
I don't know if what you did
was right or wrong,

16:05.238 --> 16:07.070
but I will tell you this,
Mr. Thomas,

16:07.072 --> 16:10.075
I am going to sell your house
and get you top dollar.

16:15.748 --> 16:18.115
Sorry, you're gonna
have to brief me later.

16:18.117 --> 16:19.250
I have to go.

16:19.252 --> 16:20.617
Steve, you promised me

16:20.619 --> 16:22.586
that we were gonna list
this house today.

16:22.588 --> 16:25.756
The market's tight,
we need to act fast.

16:25.758 --> 16:27.257
Steve...

16:27.259 --> 16:28.258
I'm sorry, Maggie,

16:28.260 --> 16:31.163
but I have to figure out
exactly what this is.

16:32.797 --> 16:35.000
I'll call you.

16:36.902 --> 16:38.203
Give me five minutes.

16:47.113 --> 16:49.179
Hey, bud...

16:49.181 --> 16:51.080
you okay?

16:51.082 --> 16:53.819
Yup. Fine.

16:55.321 --> 16:57.253
You sure?

16:57.255 --> 17:00.092
I'm fine, okay?

17:01.627 --> 17:03.327
Sandra's gonna take me
to the university,

17:03.329 --> 17:05.060
but when I'm done,

17:05.063 --> 17:07.932
we'll grab a burger,
take in a movie.

17:07.934 --> 17:09.767
Heck, guys' night out.

17:09.769 --> 17:11.601
We'll grab two burgers
and watch two movies.

17:11.603 --> 17:12.970
What do you think?

17:12.972 --> 17:15.308
Sure, whatever.

17:16.742 --> 17:18.943
Hey, bud.

17:18.944 --> 17:21.109
Just go, okay?

17:21.112 --> 17:23.048
Just go!

17:30.156 --> 17:33.126
Think of a movie.

17:41.833 --> 17:42.832
Tell me about A.L.A.T.,

17:42.834 --> 17:45.802
your "Asteroid
Locating and Tracking" project.

17:45.804 --> 17:46.971
I'm busy.

17:46.973 --> 17:48.705
We had a deal.

17:48.707 --> 17:50.640
I record everything you discover
about the space rock,

17:50.642 --> 17:52.909
and you give me an interview.

17:54.179 --> 17:55.878
The A.L.A.T. program
is a satellite

17:55.880 --> 17:57.748
equipped with radar
and infrared technology

17:57.750 --> 18:00.017
that enables us
to detect asteroids

18:00.019 --> 18:01.784
by their heat signatures

18:01.786 --> 18:03.186
instead of
reflected sunlight alone.

18:03.188 --> 18:05.390
I already know that.

18:07.158 --> 18:08.358
You leaked
the information.

18:08.360 --> 18:09.827
Remember?

18:09.829 --> 18:12.365
Look, I need
a real story.

18:14.699 --> 18:15.799
When did you know
that your project

18:15.801 --> 18:17.800
was just another illegal
global surveillance program?

18:17.802 --> 18:19.269
It wasn't "my" program,

18:19.271 --> 18:21.805
there were other scientists
involved in its development.

18:21.807 --> 18:23.374
You were
the team leader.

18:23.376 --> 18:24.907
It was your baby.

18:24.909 --> 18:26.676
How did you find out

18:26.678 --> 18:27.711
that the military
had turned A.L.A.T.

18:27.713 --> 18:28.846
into a spy satellite

18:28.848 --> 18:31.117
being used against
our allies?

18:33.686 --> 18:35.019
Would you go public again,

18:35.021 --> 18:37.421
if you knew
what the fall-out would be?

18:37.423 --> 18:39.056
I'll be damned.

18:39.058 --> 18:41.125
Is that a yes?

18:43.294 --> 18:45.729
When a meteor
enters Earth's atmosphere,

18:45.731 --> 18:48.264
the air friction
causes its surface to burn,

18:48.266 --> 18:51.069
creating a glass-like shell.

18:54.273 --> 18:55.705
And?

18:55.707 --> 18:57.407
This one didn't.

18:57.409 --> 19:00.210
Something about its composition

19:00.212 --> 19:03.917
makes its surface
non-reflective.

19:16.227 --> 19:18.997
Oh! Whoa!

19:20.032 --> 19:21.298
What happened?

19:21.300 --> 19:22.799
It expanded

19:22.801 --> 19:25.435
because our space rock contains
sodium phosphide.

19:25.437 --> 19:26.904
Sodium phosphide?
Like detergent?

19:26.906 --> 19:28.838
No. It's a black, ionic salt
that contains

19:28.840 --> 19:31.241
the alkali metal sodium
and...

19:31.243 --> 19:34.310
the phosphide anion.

19:34.312 --> 19:35.945
Hey. Can I have a piece?

19:35.947 --> 19:38.217
Help yourself.

19:41.020 --> 19:43.119
Hey, isn't that
the disgraced scientist?

19:43.121 --> 19:44.120
This interview's over.

19:44.122 --> 19:45.321
Send me the footage.

19:45.323 --> 19:47.023
Are you kidding me?
That's it?

19:47.025 --> 19:49.059
Oh!

19:57.869 --> 19:59.336
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

19:59.338 --> 20:00.471
What do you want?

20:00.473 --> 20:01.504
<i>Can you talk?</i>

20:01.506 --> 20:04.007
And get fired?
I don't think so.

20:04.009 --> 20:06.210
Sodium phosphide.

20:06.212 --> 20:08.011
What about it?

20:08.013 --> 20:09.812
It, along with
several metal alloys

20:09.814 --> 20:11.147
that I'm not familiar with,

20:11.149 --> 20:12.415
showed up in the meteorite

20:12.417 --> 20:14.751
I dug up out of my backyard
this morning.

20:14.753 --> 20:15.686
Impossible.

20:15.688 --> 20:17.855
All of the samples
we collected and tested

20:17.857 --> 20:19.155
are classic stony-iron.

20:19.157 --> 20:21.224
Remnants of GX210?

20:21.226 --> 20:24.027
<i>Looks like it suffered
an integrity breakdown</i>

20:24.029 --> 20:26.195
from Earth's
gravitational pull.

20:26.197 --> 20:27.798
We think it
imploded.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.500
I just tested mine
at the university.

20:29.502 --> 20:31.434
<i>It's not
a remnant of GX210.</i>

20:31.436 --> 20:33.236
Well, bring it in.
I'll have a look.

20:33.238 --> 20:34.871
No.

20:34.873 --> 20:37.242
Until I know what it is,
it stays with me.

20:38.843 --> 20:40.543
For what it's worth,
Steve...

20:40.545 --> 20:42.146
I'm sorry.

20:42.148 --> 20:45.048
I should have spoken out
when you did.

20:45.050 --> 20:48.487
Why didn't you?

20:50.822 --> 20:53.523
<i>I couldn't.
I gotta go.</i>

21:08.573 --> 21:10.174
Lose something?

21:10.176 --> 21:12.341
My car.

21:12.343 --> 21:14.978
You came with me,
Dr. Thomas.

21:14.980 --> 21:16.245
Right.

21:16.247 --> 21:18.147
Do you want
a ride home?

21:18.149 --> 21:21.885
Yes. Thank you.

21:21.887 --> 21:24.421
So, is this sodium phosphide
in a meteor rare?

21:24.423 --> 21:26.155
Yes.

21:26.157 --> 21:28.826
The kind of "rare"

21:28.828 --> 21:31.330
your A.L.A.T. satellite
would pick up?

21:33.032 --> 21:35.432
No comment.

21:52.451 --> 21:53.584
<i>Flight 114,</i>

21:53.586 --> 21:56.220
<i>we're tracing
multiple objects inbound.</i>

21:56.222 --> 21:57.657
<i>Can you visualize?</i>

22:00.458 --> 22:01.693
<i>Whoa!</i>

22:03.462 --> 22:04.664
<i>That was a near miss!</i>

22:06.031 --> 22:07.897
<i>I have no idea what that was.</i>

22:07.899 --> 22:10.702
<i>Tower, looked like a meteor.</i>

22:33.958 --> 22:36.158
Thanks again
for all your help.

22:36.160 --> 22:38.528
You're welcome.

22:38.530 --> 22:40.463
You don't need Bill
to get to me.

22:40.465 --> 22:42.665
Until I get the rest of
my no-holds-barred interview,

22:42.667 --> 22:43.934
he's fair game.

22:43.936 --> 22:45.969
Why are you so pushy?

22:45.971 --> 22:47.337
Because I need this,
Dr. Thomas.

22:47.339 --> 22:49.106
For a thesis report,

22:49.108 --> 22:51.508
and right now this story
is my best shot at graduating.

22:51.510 --> 22:53.309
Well...

22:53.311 --> 22:56.346
don't be surprised if you don't
get what you're expecting.

22:56.348 --> 22:59.515
When I think of the mess
my life has become,

22:59.517 --> 23:01.117
I'm not so sure
I did the right thing.

23:01.119 --> 23:02.551
You did.

23:02.553 --> 23:05.323
And don't you forget it.

23:07.493 --> 23:09.661
Goodnight.

23:22.373 --> 23:25.608
Don't you people have
anything better to do?

23:25.610 --> 23:27.210
You are a national
security risk,

23:27.212 --> 23:28.345
Mr. Thomas.

23:28.347 --> 23:29.445
We will continue
to monitor

23:29.447 --> 23:30.579
you and your family.

23:30.581 --> 23:32.014
You leave my family
out of this.

23:32.016 --> 23:34.084
You broke the law
and betrayed the country.

23:34.086 --> 23:35.284
You don't get to make demands.

23:35.286 --> 23:37.553
Since when is it illegal to tell
the truth in this country?

23:37.555 --> 23:40.723
Just doing
our jobs, Steve.

23:40.725 --> 23:44.994
I hope you and Maggie
work out these trust issues.

24:06.251 --> 24:07.149
...I tell you,

24:07.151 --> 24:08.385
I make more working direct

24:08.387 --> 24:11.490
than I ever did
for the cable companies.

24:12.590 --> 24:16.026
Hey, Maggie brought us pizza,
and there's beers in the fridge.

24:16.028 --> 24:17.293
Thanks.

24:17.295 --> 24:23.666
What did you think
of Sandra? Huh?

24:23.668 --> 24:24.734
Smart girl.

24:24.736 --> 24:27.738
Yeah, she's smart!
And she's hot!

24:27.740 --> 24:29.106
Who would've thought
a girl like that

24:29.108 --> 24:31.472
would be interested
in a guy like me?

24:31.474 --> 24:32.642
But it happens.

24:32.644 --> 24:35.278
So how did it go with
the real estate agent?

24:35.280 --> 24:36.746
Fine.

24:36.748 --> 24:38.714
She took
some pictures.

24:38.716 --> 24:42.520
Place is gonna be listed
at the end of the week.

24:43.589 --> 24:45.155
Kyle come with you?

24:45.157 --> 24:46.423
No.

24:46.425 --> 24:47.491
He's with my sister.

24:47.493 --> 24:49.126
"Nosy Nora."

24:49.128 --> 24:52.194
"Nosy Nora" takes an interest.

24:52.196 --> 24:54.097
Kyle knows the importance
of that meteorite find.

24:54.099 --> 24:55.699
It's unlike anything
I've ever seen before.

24:55.701 --> 24:56.799
Right. Mm-hmm.

24:56.801 --> 24:58.568
Your teenaged son
is perfectly fine

24:58.570 --> 25:00.369
coming second
to a flying rock.

25:00.371 --> 25:02.172
You know what?

25:02.174 --> 25:05.709
I feel like, um,
you two need to talk,

25:05.711 --> 25:08.078
so I'll just be
in the other room,

25:08.080 --> 25:09.346
creeping on
a reporter's Facebook.

25:09.348 --> 25:10.379
If you need me,

25:10.381 --> 25:14.286
that's where I'll be.

25:17.321 --> 25:19.655
Kyle's rocket
launch competition

25:19.657 --> 25:20.790
is in two days.

25:20.792 --> 25:22.192
Does that ring a bell?

25:22.194 --> 25:24.194
Oh, no.

25:24.196 --> 25:25.628
Told you about it
over a month ago,

25:25.630 --> 25:27.630
when he won
the state preliminary.

25:27.632 --> 25:29.132
- I'll call him.
- Don't bother.

25:29.134 --> 25:32.135
You don't take
an interest, Steve.

25:32.137 --> 25:33.537
You prioritize
everything else over Kyle,

25:33.539 --> 25:34.637
and he feels that.

25:34.639 --> 25:36.540
I thought he was upset
about us selling the house.

25:36.542 --> 25:39.776
He's upset about
a lot of things!

25:39.778 --> 25:41.544
This is such a mess.

25:41.546 --> 25:42.611
Yeah, it is.

25:42.613 --> 25:43.613
Kyle and I understand

25:43.615 --> 25:45.682
the courage that it took
for you to go public,

25:45.684 --> 25:47.416
but I don't think
that you understand

25:47.418 --> 25:52.155
the courage that it took for us
to deal with the aftermath.

25:52.157 --> 25:55.625
He's been bullied
and beaten,

25:55.627 --> 25:57.626
trying to defend you.

25:57.628 --> 26:00.262
And where are you
when he needs you?

26:00.264 --> 26:01.697
Hmm?

26:01.699 --> 26:03.500
Where are you
when I need you?

26:03.502 --> 26:05.668
I'm here! I've always been here
for you and Kyle!

26:05.670 --> 26:06.802
Part of the team!

26:06.804 --> 26:08.805
You went public
about a spy satellite

26:08.807 --> 26:10.173
without telling us!

26:10.175 --> 26:12.142
We had no way
to prepare ourselves!

26:12.144 --> 26:13.643
How is that
being part of a team?

26:13.645 --> 26:14.711
I was trying to protect you.

26:14.713 --> 26:17.783
Well, you failed!

26:38.337 --> 26:40.706
So, uh...

26:42.741 --> 26:46.276
You, uh...
gonna go after her?

26:46.278 --> 26:49.915
No, I can't.
She's right.

27:01.627 --> 27:04.563
What do you want, weirdos?

27:09.767 --> 27:11.734
I could do that job.

27:11.736 --> 27:12.769
What?

27:12.771 --> 27:14.370
Ah, sitting
on my ass all day,

27:14.372 --> 27:16.740
drinking coffee,
watching people.

27:16.742 --> 27:18.508
You think they use
hemorrhoid cushions?

27:18.510 --> 27:20.676
I got to go.

27:20.678 --> 27:21.711
Hey, I'm just trying...

27:21.713 --> 27:22.846
No. I got to
get out of here

27:22.848 --> 27:24.213
without those goons
following me.

27:24.215 --> 27:25.348
Whoa, whoa, what's up?

27:25.350 --> 27:26.482
I have a meeting
with Casey.

27:26.484 --> 27:28.484
It's important.

27:28.486 --> 27:30.287
How important?

27:30.289 --> 27:31.820
I may have to bring
my old satellite

27:31.822 --> 27:33.690
back online
to prove the existence

27:33.692 --> 27:35.961
of a very
dangerous asteroid.

27:39.197 --> 27:41.364
I have an idea.

27:41.366 --> 27:43.934
It's an oldie,
but a goodie.

27:43.936 --> 27:47.503
Give me two minutes.

28:09.227 --> 28:11.630
What the hell's he up to?

28:13.331 --> 28:15.767
Is he bird-watching?

28:17.668 --> 28:19.638
I don't see anything.

28:40.725 --> 28:43.027
He's on the move.

28:54.872 --> 28:55.871
What the hell?

28:59.543 --> 29:01.580
Shoot!

29:03.415 --> 29:05.751
Damn it!

29:24.602 --> 29:26.502
I've got to ask you
another favor.

29:26.504 --> 29:27.805
<i>I don't think
they're gonna fall</i>

29:27.807 --> 29:29.405
<i>for the ol' banana-
in-the-tail-pipe thing again.</i>

29:29.407 --> 29:30.740
Plus, I'm out of bananas.

29:30.742 --> 29:32.309
<i>I need you
to come to Wyman U.</i>

29:32.311 --> 29:34.077
<i>Drive into the underground
parking lot.</i>

29:34.079 --> 29:35.878
You'll see my car.
Wait for me.

29:35.880 --> 29:38.447
Ooh. Cloak-and-dagger.
I like it.

29:38.449 --> 29:40.015
This is serious, Bill.

29:40.017 --> 29:41.050
<i>I know
it's serious.</i>

29:41.052 --> 29:42.519
I'll be there in an hour.

29:42.521 --> 29:43.619
I just got some installations
to do.

29:43.621 --> 29:44.854
- An hour?
- <i>Yeah!</i>

29:44.856 --> 29:46.322
I got bills to pay, buddy.

29:46.324 --> 29:47.389
<i>As a reminder,</i>

29:47.391 --> 29:49.626
I said
"very dangerous asteroid."

29:49.628 --> 29:51.360
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

29:51.362 --> 29:53.064
I'll drop everything
and meet you.

30:07.646 --> 30:09.678
- You're two minutes late.
- Would you relax?

30:09.680 --> 30:11.348
They think you're
a threat to the country.

30:11.350 --> 30:12.382
If I'm caught...

30:12.384 --> 30:14.084
Casey, I get it.

30:14.086 --> 30:16.989
But it's worth
the risk.

30:26.697 --> 30:28.732
What the hell
is this?

30:28.734 --> 30:29.866
That's what I said.

30:29.868 --> 30:30.934
Here.

30:30.936 --> 30:33.037
Check it out.

30:36.808 --> 30:39.842
I think GX210 collided
with a dark asteroid

30:39.844 --> 30:40.976
and shattered.

30:40.978 --> 30:42.678
That's what caused
this meteor storm.

30:42.680 --> 30:44.580
A "dark asteroid,"
are you kidding me?

30:44.582 --> 30:46.383
It's like nothing
I've ever seen before.

30:46.385 --> 30:47.649
Almost non-
existent albedo

30:47.651 --> 30:51.120
with a featureless
electromagnetic spectrum.

30:51.122 --> 30:52.688
The x-ray
diffractometer

30:52.690 --> 30:55.524
could only detect traces
of sodium phosphide.

30:55.526 --> 30:58.461
Unknown silicates make up
the rest of the composition.

30:58.463 --> 31:00.864
This is way out
in left-field.

31:00.866 --> 31:02.831
I mean, we don't even know
what this is made out of.

31:02.833 --> 31:05.136
That why I roughed in
a simulation this morning.

31:09.140 --> 31:12.244
Look at
the original trajectory.

31:13.578 --> 31:15.444
I mean...

31:15.446 --> 31:19.816
GX210 didn't just fall apart...
it was knocked off-course.

31:19.818 --> 31:21.984
There's
too many variables

31:21.986 --> 31:23.653
to know exactly
what happened.

31:23.655 --> 31:24.788
That's why
we need a visual.

31:24.790 --> 31:25.723
If this is out there,

31:25.725 --> 31:29.492
we need to do a complete
orbit computation.

31:29.494 --> 31:31.828
Dark asteroids
don't reflect the sunlight,

31:31.830 --> 31:32.963
they absorb it.

31:32.965 --> 31:34.998
The only way that they can
be seen is with infrared.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.098
Exactly.

31:36.100 --> 31:38.600
That's why we need to
get A.L.A.T. up and running.

31:40.004 --> 31:41.738
Are you nuts?

31:41.740 --> 31:44.507
That entire wing got shut down
once the scandal hit.

31:44.509 --> 31:45.575
If the Feds see you
anywhere near there,

31:45.577 --> 31:49.148
they're gonna shoot first
and ask questions later.

31:50.849 --> 31:52.048
What if you're wrong?

31:52.050 --> 31:56.088
What if GX210
simply did implode?

31:58.523 --> 32:00.522
Your asteroid chunk
could've been floating by

32:00.524 --> 32:02.492
and got caught up
in the debris.

32:02.494 --> 32:05.561
I won't go to jail
on a hunch.

32:05.563 --> 32:07.530
We designed
and built A.L.A.T.

32:07.532 --> 32:08.932
for this exact situation.

32:08.934 --> 32:10.732
It's an unknown, Casey.

32:10.734 --> 32:12.836
Right now, there
could be an asteroid

32:12.838 --> 32:14.604
on the same trajectory
as that meteor storm.

32:14.606 --> 32:17.807
An asteroid
we can't see coming.

32:17.809 --> 32:21.644
If it's big enough
to take out GX210...

32:21.646 --> 32:24.949
We're talking about
a potential planet-killer.

32:28.820 --> 32:30.089
Okay.

32:39.196 --> 32:40.762
New access codes.

32:40.764 --> 32:42.065
Do whatever
you have to do,

32:42.067 --> 32:43.098
but don't include me.

32:43.100 --> 32:44.166
We're done.

32:44.168 --> 32:45.734
I need more than
access codes, Casey.

32:45.736 --> 32:46.970
I don't want you
near me ever again.

33:19.971 --> 33:21.738
<i>Yesterday's meteor storm</i>

33:21.740 --> 33:24.240
<i>has been classified
as a freak celestial occurrence,</i>

33:24.242 --> 33:25.508
<i>but unconfirmed reports</i>

33:25.510 --> 33:28.243
<i>of similar meteor activity
from around the globe</i>

33:28.245 --> 33:29.945
<i>are appearing online.</i>

33:29.947 --> 33:34.919
<i>Officials
are unavailable for comment.</i>

33:37.955 --> 33:38.954
You want to tell me

33:38.956 --> 33:42.559
why you've got me
watching your car all day?

33:42.561 --> 33:44.761
Casey's gonna help me get
the satellite up and running.

33:44.763 --> 33:45.761
To do that,

33:45.763 --> 33:48.196
I need you to help me
break into my old lab.

33:48.198 --> 33:50.165
Serious?

33:50.167 --> 33:53.235
"End of the world" serious.

33:53.237 --> 33:55.038
What's the plan?

33:55.040 --> 33:56.673
I've got an idea.

33:56.675 --> 33:59.011
I hope it's a good one.

34:11.221 --> 34:12.621
Hello?

34:12.623 --> 34:13.757
Can I come in?

34:15.159 --> 34:19.030
Yeah. Sure.
It's not my room anymore.

34:20.732 --> 34:23.032
So...

34:23.034 --> 34:27.070
You, uh, getting nervous about
the competition tomorrow?

34:27.072 --> 34:28.670
Nope.

34:28.672 --> 34:30.306
Probably not gonna win anyway.

34:30.308 --> 34:32.208
Hey! You don't know that.

34:32.210 --> 34:33.976
Your rocket
made it into the finals.

34:33.978 --> 34:37.148
There's a very good chance
it could win.

34:38.215 --> 34:40.083
Are you and Dad
getting a divorce?

34:43.355 --> 34:44.954
Honey, it's complicated.

34:44.956 --> 34:48.824
Oh, my God.

34:48.826 --> 34:51.226
We're living at Aunt Nora's
and you're selling the house!

34:51.228 --> 34:52.829
You're getting a divorce, Mom!

34:52.831 --> 34:54.663
No matter what happens, honey,

34:54.665 --> 34:55.732
what's most important

34:55.734 --> 34:58.000
is that you know your dad and I
love you so much.

34:58.002 --> 34:59.235
Well, where is he?

34:59.237 --> 35:01.137
Why'd he forget the competition?

35:01.139 --> 35:02.672
He's under a lot of pressure.

35:02.674 --> 35:04.007
Yeah, he's not
the only one!

35:04.009 --> 35:05.141
I know, I know.

35:05.143 --> 35:08.177
Okay?

35:08.179 --> 35:09.481
I don't want to talk.

35:15.386 --> 35:17.288
All right.

35:18.857 --> 35:22.190
Um, I'll get
started on lunch.

35:22.192 --> 35:23.461
Yeah.

35:39.710 --> 35:41.309
There are
two guards here.

35:41.311 --> 35:42.811
Does one of them
look a little scary?

35:42.813 --> 35:44.846
Yeah, one guy looks
a little scary.

35:44.848 --> 35:46.882
That's Hank.
He's a football fan.

35:46.884 --> 35:49.085
Ask him if the U Of O
Ducks won today.

35:49.087 --> 35:50.085
- U of O what?
- Ducks.

35:50.087 --> 35:52.387
Hey, how you doing?

35:52.389 --> 35:53.855
Sorry I'm late,

35:53.857 --> 35:55.291
but that, uh,
that meteor storm yesterday

35:55.293 --> 35:56.893
really screwed everything up.

35:56.895 --> 35:59.161
You got
some picture I.D.?

35:59.163 --> 36:00.697
Yes! Yes, I do.

36:00.699 --> 36:05.268
Did that, uh, that Ducks game
get canceled?

36:05.270 --> 36:06.835
No. They won.

36:06.837 --> 36:09.438
They won, huh?
That's great.

36:09.440 --> 36:10.000
That's good.
I really like that team.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.208
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to
That's good.
I really like that team.

36:12.208 --> 36:12.210
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:12.210 --> 36:13.942
They're gonna go
all the way this year, I think.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:13.944 --> 36:15.212
Wait here.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:15.212 --> 36:16.980
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:16.980 --> 36:19.949
Oh, he went away.
He looks mad.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:19.949 --> 36:19.951
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:19.951 --> 36:21.817
Damn.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:21.819 --> 36:22.000
Maybe he's
a Beavers fan.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:22.000 --> 36:23.386
Maybe he's
a Beavers fan.

36:23.388 --> 36:26.188
Shut up.

36:26.190 --> 36:28.023
You shut up.

36:28.025 --> 36:31.059
You're not on
the visitor roster.

36:31.061 --> 36:33.962
Really? Because they called
about the cable receptors.

36:33.964 --> 36:36.132
Must be some kind of problem on
the east side of the building.

36:36.134 --> 36:38.233
We're gonna need
to search your vehicle.

36:38.235 --> 36:39.735
- Sure.
- Okay?

36:39.737 --> 36:41.837
Sure. Yeah.

36:41.839 --> 36:44.075
He's searching the vehicle.

36:46.344 --> 36:48.009
Can you unlock

36:48.011 --> 36:48.945
this door, please?

36:48.947 --> 36:50.480
Yeah! Uh, sure.
One second.

36:50.482 --> 36:52.949
What are we doing here?
We're just going to jail?

36:52.951 --> 36:55.250
Here comes the cavalry.

36:55.252 --> 36:57.388
- What cavalry?
- Your girl.

37:04.962 --> 37:07.395
Hey! Hey, you can't be here.
This is private property.

37:07.397 --> 37:08.998
Actually, this is
government property

37:09.000 --> 37:11.467
and it's paid for
by our tax dollars.

37:11.469 --> 37:14.170
And we have
the constitutional right...

37:14.172 --> 37:16.072
- ...To a peaceful protest.
- Are you serious?

37:16.074 --> 37:17.306
Isn't she something?

37:17.308 --> 37:19.407
This is not
a safe place for...

37:19.409 --> 37:20.543
Hey!

37:20.545 --> 37:22.445
Let him through.

37:22.447 --> 37:23.846
Put your camera down...

37:23.848 --> 37:25.249
Talk to me
like a person.

37:26.484 --> 37:28.416
Let him through.

37:28.418 --> 37:30.786
Can you people move back
10 or 15?

37:30.788 --> 37:32.989
This is...
this is a public road we're on.

37:32.991 --> 37:34.857
Hey, if you can pull the wax
out of your ears.

37:34.859 --> 37:36.391
You know, if you people

37:36.393 --> 37:38.295
took a bath
every once in a while...

38:23.942 --> 38:27.210
I feel a little claustrophobic.

38:27.212 --> 38:28.543
We can do this.

38:28.545 --> 38:30.313
Yeah, right. Okay.

38:30.315 --> 38:33.317
Here we go.

38:38.456 --> 38:40.489
What is this place?

38:40.491 --> 38:42.491
This is where
we built my satellite.

38:42.493 --> 38:44.360
Crazy.

38:44.362 --> 38:48.297
They shut this wing down
the day after the scandal hit.

38:48.299 --> 38:50.602
Come on.

38:57.475 --> 39:01.076
- I feel like I'm at a...
- Hello.

39:01.078 --> 39:03.478
- Pajama party or something.
- So far, so good.

39:03.480 --> 39:05.480
Here. This one,
this one, this one.

39:05.482 --> 39:07.449
This one.

39:07.451 --> 39:09.351
Okay...

39:09.353 --> 39:10.920
Open it.

39:10.922 --> 39:11.954
Yeah. Just give me a second..

39:11.956 --> 39:13.358
What am I, a magician?

39:16.094 --> 39:18.126
All right...

39:18.128 --> 39:19.128
All right.

39:19.130 --> 39:21.396
There we go.

39:21.398 --> 39:24.032
There we go...

39:26.603 --> 39:27.637
You okay?

39:27.639 --> 39:31.139
Yeah. Yeah.
Everything's fine.

39:31.141 --> 39:32.675
Smudges? Really?

39:32.677 --> 39:33.942
Fingerprints.

39:33.944 --> 39:36.313
You can't
do that at home?

39:42.686 --> 39:44.219
Thank God,
they didn't dismantle it.

39:44.221 --> 39:46.422
All right.
I need you to secure the door.

39:46.424 --> 39:48.559
Okay! You got it.

39:51.529 --> 39:53.596
Once we get this thing
booted up,

39:53.598 --> 39:55.331
we're gonna have company
pretty quick, right?

39:55.333 --> 39:58.467
Yep. We're only gonna have
a few minutes to make this work.

40:03.607 --> 40:05.273
This is so cool.

40:05.275 --> 40:06.541
Don't touch anything!

40:06.543 --> 40:08.579
I'm not.

40:14.085 --> 40:16.217
That wasn't me,
I swear.

40:16.219 --> 40:17.686
I know.

40:17.688 --> 40:18.855
We're in.

40:18.857 --> 40:22.291
Are you actually controlling
a spy satellite right now?

40:22.293 --> 40:24.159
"Retired" satellite.

40:24.161 --> 40:28.264
We're finally going to use this
as it was intended.

40:54.125 --> 40:56.192
What are
you doing now?

40:56.194 --> 40:58.126
I'm using the satellite's
frequency generator

40:58.128 --> 41:00.295
to send out
electromagnetic pulses

41:00.297 --> 41:02.030
at 2-5 microns.

41:02.032 --> 41:04.065
It's following the same
trajectory as the meteor storm.

41:04.067 --> 41:04.866
Okay. English.
English.

41:04.868 --> 41:07.268
Will that let us
find the asteroid?

41:07.270 --> 41:08.670
I hope not.

41:08.672 --> 41:10.105
What?

41:10.107 --> 41:11.639
I'm praying that there's
nothing else out there.

41:11.641 --> 41:12.675
Oh. Right.

41:19.250 --> 41:20.215
Barker.

41:20.217 --> 41:21.616
<i>Sir, we have
a security breach.</i>

41:21.618 --> 41:23.585
Excuse me?

41:23.587 --> 41:25.487
A cable repairman,
unscheduled.

41:25.489 --> 41:27.056
<i>We suspect he's somewhere
in the building.</i>

41:27.058 --> 41:29.157
How the hell
did he get past security?

41:29.159 --> 41:30.726
The disturbance
due to the protestors.

41:30.728 --> 41:31.761
Well, find him!

41:31.763 --> 41:33.429
Sir!

41:33.431 --> 41:35.764
A.L.A.T.'s operating system's
been accessed.

41:35.766 --> 41:37.132
It's online!

41:37.134 --> 41:40.404
I want security
at the A.L.A.T. lab now!

41:53.618 --> 41:55.317
Damn.

41:55.319 --> 41:57.253
"Damn." What damn?

41:57.255 --> 41:59.454
It's another meteor storm...

41:59.456 --> 42:01.389
but that's not the problem.

42:01.391 --> 42:04.496
That's not the problem?
What's the problem?

42:11.168 --> 42:11.833
That.

42:18.509 --> 42:21.313
It's a dark asteroid.

42:33.090 --> 42:35.726
It's not working!

42:37.194 --> 42:40.364
Calculating point of impact.

42:46.804 --> 42:49.674
We've got company.

42:54.679 --> 42:55.947
Look out,
look out, look out!

43:03.121 --> 43:06.558
Shut the power down
in the lab now!

43:08.326 --> 43:10.226
We're going to prison, right?

43:10.228 --> 43:12.831
Prison's the last thing
we should be worried about.

43:19.804 --> 43:22.538
Is that thing
coming towards us?

43:22.540 --> 43:23.572
Yes.

43:23.574 --> 43:25.541
What?

43:25.543 --> 43:27.476
Shouldn't we...
I don't know,

43:27.478 --> 43:30.813
get out there and tell
people or something?

43:36.821 --> 43:38.487
They cut the power.

43:40.525 --> 43:42.794
We're unarmed!

43:46.864 --> 43:49.498
Thank you so much, gentlemen.

43:49.500 --> 43:51.803
We'll have that report
on your desk within the hour.

43:52.904 --> 43:55.974
Time to get back to work.

43:57.542 --> 43:58.741
Do you realize

43:58.743 --> 44:00.875
how much trouble
your brother is in

44:00.877 --> 44:02.043
because of you?

44:02.045 --> 44:05.648
I take full responsibility
for breaking into that lab.

44:05.650 --> 44:07.416
And I take
full responsibility

44:07.418 --> 44:08.217
for helping him.

44:08.219 --> 44:10.920
You broke into
a federal building

44:10.922 --> 44:12.654
and hacked into a satellite

44:12.656 --> 44:15.391
decommissioned on direct order
from the President.

44:15.393 --> 44:18.460
You're both going to prison
for a very long time.

44:18.462 --> 44:19.527
We had no choice.

44:19.529 --> 44:21.896
I had to prove the existence
of a dark asteroid.

44:21.898 --> 44:24.900
What "dark asteroid"?

44:24.902 --> 44:26.969
The massive one
that collided with GX210,

44:26.971 --> 44:29.804
turning it into
that meteor storm.

44:29.806 --> 44:30.940
A.L.A.T. located it.
The data indicates

44:30.942 --> 44:32.808
it's on a collision
course with Earth.

44:32.810 --> 44:34.476
That's impossible.

44:34.478 --> 44:36.744
Russia's about to get hit
by a meteor storm,

44:36.746 --> 44:39.415
then Berlin, then London.

44:39.417 --> 44:40.748
The meteors
will keep getting bigger.

44:40.750 --> 44:42.684
And you know this how?

44:42.686 --> 44:43.819
It's fundamental physics, Phil.

44:43.821 --> 44:45.487
In an asteroid collision,

44:45.489 --> 44:48.757
the resulting explosion flings
debris further into space.

44:48.759 --> 44:50.925
The rest of GX210
is still coming.

44:50.927 --> 44:52.962
But that's not
the worst of it.

44:52.964 --> 44:55.297
Really, and what is?

44:55.299 --> 44:57.565
The second wave of destruction
will be the dark asteroid.

44:57.567 --> 44:58.800
It is going to hit

44:58.802 --> 44:59.969
somewhere in
the continental U.S.,

44:59.971 --> 45:01.536
and it will be catastrophic.

45:01.538 --> 45:02.938
It's true.
I saw it with my own eyes,

45:02.940 --> 45:04.773
right before you cut the power.
Thanks for that.

45:04.775 --> 45:05.773
Why won't you listen to me?

45:05.775 --> 45:07.543
Because I don't trust you.

45:07.545 --> 45:08.978
There's millions of lives
at stake, Phil.

45:08.980 --> 45:10.346
This isn't about you and me.

45:10.348 --> 45:11.947
We need A.L.A.T. now.

45:11.949 --> 45:13.616
Call the Secretary
of Defense!

45:13.618 --> 45:15.951
while we still
have time!

45:15.953 --> 45:17.453
Get them out of here now.

45:17.455 --> 45:20.288
Casey! Tell him to put
A.L.A.T. back on-line!

45:20.290 --> 45:21.956
We need to find
a way to fix this!

45:21.958 --> 45:24.927
Casey!

45:24.929 --> 45:26.395
Sir...

45:26.397 --> 45:27.862
maybe we should
explore this.

45:27.864 --> 45:29.864
Harris...

45:29.866 --> 45:32.735
did you help
Thomas break into the lab?

45:32.737 --> 45:34.973
No, sir.

45:37.875 --> 45:39.775
I hope not...

45:39.777 --> 45:41.744
because, if you did,

45:41.746 --> 45:43.478
you will be tried as a traitor
along with him

45:43.480 --> 45:44.880
and his brother,
do you understand me?

45:44.882 --> 45:47.483
Yes, sir.

45:47.485 --> 45:49.521
- Get back to work.
- Yes, sir.

46:04.902 --> 46:06.534
Hon', I know
this sucks,

46:06.536 --> 46:08.536
but we have to
get it done.

46:08.538 --> 46:11.639
Okay? Staging's going
to help sell the house.

46:11.641 --> 46:13.875
I know.

46:13.877 --> 46:15.511
Have you even

46:15.513 --> 46:17.712
touched your
telescope room yet?

46:17.714 --> 46:20.083
I'll get around to it.

46:22.552 --> 46:25.654
Today, please.

46:39.804 --> 46:42.603
<i>It's Steve. I'm not here,
so leave me a message.</i>

46:42.605 --> 46:45.007
Steve, you can
keep running from me,

46:45.009 --> 46:46.074
I can handle that,

46:46.076 --> 46:48.576
but you cannot do that
to our son.

46:48.578 --> 46:49.677
Okay? You're gonna
break his heart

46:49.679 --> 46:52.883
if you're not at that
rocket competition tomorrow.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.067
You okay?

47:12.069 --> 47:13.802
I'm great,

47:13.804 --> 47:15.670
considering
we're handcuffed

47:15.672 --> 47:17.105
and, you know,
locked in a room.

47:17.107 --> 47:19.574
Sorry I ever got you
into this mess.

47:19.576 --> 47:20.809
Think about the fun
we could have

47:20.811 --> 47:22.978
if we got into serious trouble
like this all the time, huh?

47:22.980 --> 47:24.512
Time is running out.

47:24.514 --> 47:26.114
I need to fine
to Maggie and Kyle

47:26.116 --> 47:26.983
before all hell
breaks loose.

47:26.985 --> 47:28.884
Okay, but something's
gonna happen.

47:28.886 --> 47:32.621
It always does.
We're the good guys, remember?

47:32.623 --> 47:35.159
Yeah... right.

47:39.929 --> 47:40.795
What is it?

47:40.797 --> 47:44.735
It's about to get intense
out there.

48:06.656 --> 48:09.893
Just let me know
if that number gets any higher.

48:11.895 --> 48:14.996
Can I help you?

48:14.998 --> 48:16.498
I'm Agent Jenkins.

48:16.500 --> 48:19.101
We're here
to transfer Steve Thomas.

48:19.103 --> 48:20.168
And none to soon.

48:20.170 --> 48:23.073
I hope he's locked up
for the rest of his life.

48:24.107 --> 48:26.175
We need to ask you
a few questions.

48:26.177 --> 48:28.680
Of course.
Come into my office.

49:16.527 --> 49:18.594
Hey, Michael.

49:18.596 --> 49:21.563
Sounds like those protesters
are causing more trouble,

49:21.565 --> 49:24.500
and Barker needs
you at the gate.

49:24.502 --> 49:26.268
What about these guys?

49:26.270 --> 49:28.773
The Feds just arrived
and they're handling it.

49:37.248 --> 49:38.579
Come to say goodbye?

49:38.581 --> 49:42.153
No. I've, um...
come to break you out.

49:50.094 --> 49:51.125
Are they close?

49:51.127 --> 49:52.963
A minute away.

49:56.065 --> 49:57.565
Are you sure
about what you saw?

49:57.567 --> 49:59.268
Zero doubt.
Try to convince them.

49:59.270 --> 50:01.136
- I'll do what I can.
- I'll be in contact.

50:01.138 --> 50:02.670
Casey...

50:02.672 --> 50:03.974
Thanks.

50:05.976 --> 50:09.011
Yeah. Okay.

50:09.013 --> 50:11.081
This way.

50:38.842 --> 50:39.840
Call Douglas.

50:39.842 --> 50:40.842
Let him know

50:40.844 --> 50:42.610
we're wrapping this up
in the next 10 minutes.

50:42.612 --> 50:44.179
So, yeah,
we were just thinking...

50:44.181 --> 50:45.179
This one?

50:45.181 --> 50:46.581
Yeah. Should be
the one.

50:46.583 --> 50:48.318
Should be the one.

50:55.826 --> 50:57.328
Go.

51:06.904 --> 51:08.170
Act natural.

51:08.172 --> 51:10.072
Oh, no.

51:10.074 --> 51:12.340
Are they looking?

51:12.342 --> 51:15.213
- Run. Run, run! Run!
- Oh, no!

51:17.214 --> 51:19.047
This way!

51:19.049 --> 51:20.852
Oh!

51:23.621 --> 51:25.286
Walking... walking...

51:25.288 --> 51:26.855
Walking...

51:26.857 --> 51:28.690
Oh, no, agents.

51:28.692 --> 51:30.625
Go, go, go!
Run! Go, go!

51:30.627 --> 51:32.128
Up the stairs!

51:37.801 --> 51:38.599
Go! Go!

51:38.601 --> 51:42.139
- Do they got guns?
- They have guns!

51:44.708 --> 51:46.974
They stole my van!

51:49.813 --> 51:53.248
Stop spying
from outer space!

51:53.250 --> 51:54.815
This way!

51:54.817 --> 51:57.284
Go! Move!

51:57.286 --> 52:00.255
I.S.P., get out of our face!

52:00.257 --> 52:03.257
Stop spying from outer space!

52:03.259 --> 52:06.427
I.S.P., get out of our face!

52:06.429 --> 52:08.965
Over here!

52:14.404 --> 52:17.239
Clear the way!
FBI! Clear the way!

52:17.241 --> 52:18.273
Out of the way! FBI!

52:23.147 --> 52:24.980
That was close.

52:24.982 --> 52:27.282
Close? That was intense!
That's what that was.

52:27.284 --> 52:28.349
And you!

52:28.351 --> 52:30.152
With the pepper spray?
I mean, that was amazing!

52:30.154 --> 52:31.152
That was...
That was hot.

52:31.154 --> 52:32.087
Sorry if that's...

52:32.089 --> 52:33.788
I'm sorry if that's weird
for me to say,

52:33.790 --> 52:35.424
but it was totally hot.

53:05.322 --> 53:06.887
Okay, what did we find out?

53:06.889 --> 53:08.223
Are there
more surveillance programs?

53:08.225 --> 53:09.291
Is A.L.A.T.
back online?

53:09.293 --> 53:11.793
There's lots to explain,
but first, another favor.

53:11.795 --> 53:13.161
- Ask away.
- Isn't she great?

53:13.163 --> 53:14.295
You're totally great.

53:14.297 --> 53:16.364
I need to get into the computer
lab at the university.

53:16.366 --> 53:17.398
Okay.

53:21.071 --> 53:22.369
What?

53:22.371 --> 53:24.072
Berlin.

53:24.074 --> 53:26.373
If my calculations are correct,
they're about to get pummeled.

53:26.375 --> 53:29.244
I think
I missed something.

53:29.246 --> 53:31.215
Who's about to get pummeled?

53:58.375 --> 54:00.909
You surprised me, Harris.

54:00.911 --> 54:03.011
I didn't think
you had the guts.

54:03.013 --> 54:05.480
I don't know
what you're talking about.

54:05.482 --> 54:06.915
Don't be stupid.
I saw the security cameras.

54:06.917 --> 54:09.153
What were you thinking?

54:10.186 --> 54:13.188
I was thinking
you were blinded by your own ego

54:13.190 --> 54:15.389
and I had to act.

54:21.031 --> 54:23.233
Ahem.

54:34.110 --> 54:38.349
You are on very dangerous
ground, my friend.

54:40.417 --> 54:42.449
I don't care.

54:42.451 --> 54:44.552
I'm not going to stand by
and let you ignore

54:44.554 --> 54:47.490
a potential threat
to this planet.

54:49.159 --> 54:50.491
Gentlemen!

54:50.493 --> 54:52.994
Escort Mr. Harris
from the premises, please.

54:52.996 --> 54:56.498
You may have just
signed humanity's death warrant.

54:56.500 --> 54:59.233
Sir, Berlin just got
hit with a meteor storm.

54:59.235 --> 55:03.038
Bigger than Russia!

55:03.040 --> 55:05.608
Get this man out of my sight.
What do you got, Walter?

56:36.532 --> 56:38.369
The rocket show.

56:39.603 --> 56:42.436
I'm doing it to them
all over again.

56:42.438 --> 56:44.405
I feel you, but you gotta look
at the big picture here.

56:44.407 --> 56:45.474
What's
the big picture?

56:45.476 --> 56:49.411
Somebody wanna tell me
what the hell is going on?

56:49.413 --> 56:51.679
Tell her.

56:51.681 --> 56:53.681
I got A.L.A.T. back online.

56:53.683 --> 56:55.382
It picked up
another meteor storm,

56:55.384 --> 56:59.286
followed by a large asteroid
headed towards Earth.

56:59.288 --> 57:00.554
How large?

57:00.556 --> 57:03.224
A diameter about twice the size
of the Empire State Building,

57:03.226 --> 57:05.427
impact some time
in the next 12 hours.

57:05.429 --> 57:07.228
Where, exactly?

57:07.230 --> 57:09.331
Somewhere in
the western continental U.S.

57:09.333 --> 57:10.734
My God.

57:12.002 --> 57:14.001
- How bad is it?
- Bad.

57:14.003 --> 57:15.536
Fallout could affect
the entire planet.

57:23.647 --> 57:24.612
You're telling me

57:24.614 --> 57:26.014
that no other country
with a space program

57:26.016 --> 57:27.382
saw this coming?

57:27.384 --> 57:29.050
Not every satellite
has infrared technology,

57:29.052 --> 57:30.719
and not every asteroid
reflects sunlight.

57:30.721 --> 57:33.755
It was invisible
until A.L.A.T. saw it.

57:33.757 --> 57:35.357
Well, we have to
warn the world.

57:35.359 --> 57:36.523
Where's the proof?

57:36.525 --> 57:38.726
That's what
we're here to get.

57:38.728 --> 57:40.195
How are
we going to do it

57:40.197 --> 57:42.197
if the access codes
don't work?

57:42.199 --> 57:44.199
Before Barker
shut everything down,

57:44.201 --> 57:46.201
I opened a back door
in their firewall.

57:46.203 --> 57:48.469
Impressive!
You're gonna hack the hackers?

57:48.471 --> 57:52.306
I am, as soon as I can decipher
this last encrypted password.

57:54.377 --> 57:55.476
How long
will that take?

57:55.478 --> 57:56.780
A couple hours.

57:59.116 --> 58:00.248
Is there anything we can do?

58:00.250 --> 58:02.282
Yeah, you can
find us some food.

58:02.284 --> 58:03.585
Food's good.

58:03.587 --> 58:05.456
Come with me.

58:16.766 --> 58:18.032
Keep pressing it.

58:18.034 --> 58:19.366
- Okay.
- Keep pressing it.

58:19.368 --> 58:20.768
I got it.
Chocolate.

58:20.770 --> 58:22.302
And...

58:27.177 --> 58:28.009
Huh?

58:28.011 --> 58:30.712
Where did you learn
how to do that?

58:30.714 --> 58:33.748
I got expelled from
a lot of schools.

58:33.750 --> 58:35.282
Drove my parents nuts.

58:35.284 --> 58:37.485
But at least
they had Steve,

58:37.487 --> 58:38.552
the star
of the family.

58:38.554 --> 58:40.188
He had all the brains.

58:40.190 --> 58:42.056
Well, there are
different kids of smarts.

58:42.058 --> 58:45.393
I like yours better.

58:45.395 --> 58:47.161
I like you.

58:47.163 --> 58:50.700
I mean, I-I...
I "like" you.

58:52.402 --> 58:54.501
I know where we can
find a hot drinks machine.

58:54.503 --> 58:56.637
Yes!

58:56.639 --> 58:58.206
Hey, listen, um...

58:58.208 --> 59:00.141
Wait.

59:00.143 --> 59:03.177
I know that
I'm not the kind of guy

59:03.179 --> 59:05.279
that a woman like you
hooks up with...

59:05.281 --> 59:07.549
I don't mean "Hook up."
You know what I mean.

59:07.551 --> 59:09.284
"A woman like" me?

59:09.286 --> 59:12.219
Yeah, you know,
somebody who's..

59:12.221 --> 59:14.655
beautiful,
and-and smart...

59:14.657 --> 59:15.790
and...

59:15.792 --> 59:17.593
And what?

59:19.563 --> 59:22.163
I just want you to know

59:22.165 --> 59:24.232
that I know
you're out of my league,

59:24.234 --> 59:28.103
and I'm okay
with that.

59:28.105 --> 59:30.170
Don't put me
on a pedestal, Bill.

59:30.172 --> 59:31.639
- I'm not!
- I'm not an angel.

59:31.641 --> 59:32.706
I know.

59:32.708 --> 59:34.775
I used you
to get to your brother.

59:35.878 --> 59:38.112
I'm cool with that.

59:38.114 --> 59:40.514
I'm serious.

59:40.516 --> 59:43.750
Look, I really needed
that story, and then...

59:43.752 --> 59:45.753
I got to know
this goofball

59:45.755 --> 59:47.491
a little bit
better and...

59:52.194 --> 59:52.994
And?

59:52.996 --> 59:54.061
And there's
a really good chance

59:54.063 --> 59:58.900
that something terrible's
gonna happen tomorrow.

59:58.902 --> 01:00:01.939
This could be
our last night on Earth.

01:00:05.741 --> 01:00:07.677
Yeah. You're right.

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:15.349
Would you like to hug?

01:00:15.351 --> 01:00:16.817
Yeah.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:00.964
I thought
I'd find you here.

01:01:02.766 --> 01:01:04.532
You doing some
last-minute calculations

01:01:04.534 --> 01:01:06.537
in your head again?

01:01:07.904 --> 01:01:10.538
This competition
is important.

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:11.371
Mm-hmm.

01:01:11.373 --> 01:01:13.208
I came up with
a whole new design,

01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:15.944
where I could reduce the drag
and increase the range...

01:01:15.946 --> 01:01:18.947
and the weather changed.

01:01:18.949 --> 01:01:22.483
My math,
it has to be right.

01:01:24.821 --> 01:01:27.657
You sound just
like your dad.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.895
Hey! Did you
see that?

01:01:33.897 --> 01:01:36.297
Yeah.

01:01:36.299 --> 01:01:38.866
After what
we saw yesterday,

01:01:38.868 --> 01:01:41.268
a shooting star doesn't
seem all that lucky.

01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:43.706
Mm. Some of them
still are.

01:01:45.275 --> 01:01:48.479
I think you should
make a wish.

01:01:51.514 --> 01:01:54.985
I don't want you and Dad
to get a divorce.

01:01:56.953 --> 01:01:59.490
I know.

01:02:01.290 --> 01:02:02.322
It's late, okay,

01:02:02.324 --> 01:02:03.925
and you have
a big day tomorrow.

01:02:03.927 --> 01:02:06.530
I think
we should go to Nora's

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.974
And where are
these news reports?

01:02:53.976 --> 01:02:55.342
It's not news.

01:02:55.344 --> 01:02:56.911
The media blackout
seems to be holding.

01:02:56.913 --> 01:02:57.978
It's social media.

01:02:57.980 --> 01:02:59.547
They're popping up
everywhere...

01:02:59.549 --> 01:03:01.650
London, France.

01:03:01.652 --> 01:03:05.585
Sir... New York just
took the biggest hit.

01:03:05.587 --> 01:03:07.521
Casualties
in the thousands.

01:03:07.523 --> 01:03:10.126
Bring it up.

01:03:24.507 --> 01:03:27.711
Damn it.

01:03:28.944 --> 01:03:31.881
Where is this storm coming from?

01:03:32.982 --> 01:03:35.550
Um, sir, Casey
mentioned to me

01:03:35.552 --> 01:03:37.751
the possibility
of a dark asteroid.

01:03:37.753 --> 01:03:40.587
There is no dark asteroid!

01:03:40.589 --> 01:03:42.690
And Mr. Harris
is no longer with us.

01:03:42.692 --> 01:03:45.559
I want facts, Walter!
Not theories.

01:03:45.561 --> 01:03:49.463
Adams! I need the diagnostic
of our tracking systems.

01:03:49.465 --> 01:03:51.699
All right, let's get
on that diagnostic right now.

01:04:08.451 --> 01:04:09.817
Okay, look, you said
a couple of hours,

01:04:09.819 --> 01:04:10.851
and now it's been all night.

01:04:10.853 --> 01:04:11.853
We have get out of here...

01:04:11.855 --> 01:04:14.621
- ...Before classes start.
- I'm nearly there.

01:04:14.623 --> 01:04:15.456
Bill, wake up.

01:04:15.458 --> 01:04:18.558
Yep, yep. I'm awake.
I'm awake. Ahem.

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.860
Did you get
the encryption?

01:04:19.862 --> 01:04:22.829
No, he didn't.

01:04:22.831 --> 01:04:23.931
Yes, I did.

01:04:23.933 --> 01:04:25.866
I'm in.

01:04:44.487 --> 01:04:45.820
I'm linking you in.

01:04:45.822 --> 01:04:47.621
Start a... a file.

01:04:47.623 --> 01:04:50.090
Print up everything you have.
I need hard copies.

01:04:50.092 --> 01:04:51.692
What can I do?

01:04:51.694 --> 01:04:53.994
I can... I can send e-mails,
I can save stuff...

01:04:53.996 --> 01:04:56.132
I could really use
some more coffee.

01:04:57.667 --> 01:04:59.235
Great.

01:05:01.203 --> 01:05:03.603
I had A.L.A.T. track

01:05:03.605 --> 01:05:04.771
the dark asteroid's
dust residual

01:05:04.773 --> 01:05:05.605
back to its origin.

01:05:05.607 --> 01:05:08.108
It was a Trojan
in Jupiter's orbit.

01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:09.777
Well, why didn't it stay there?

01:05:09.779 --> 01:05:10.878
Perturbation.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.880
Competition between
the sun's gravitational pull,

01:05:12.882 --> 01:05:14.849
and Jupiter's created
enough orbital energy

01:05:14.851 --> 01:05:16.483
to fling it into space.

01:05:16.485 --> 01:05:17.617
Like a sling-shot?

01:05:17.619 --> 01:05:18.886
It's more like
a cue ball.

01:05:18.888 --> 01:05:20.987
It's hitting every other
asteroid in its path,

01:05:20.989 --> 01:05:22.623
causing these meteor storms

01:05:22.625 --> 01:05:24.025
with incredible
debris velocity.

01:05:24.027 --> 01:05:26.460
It's why we're having
so much trouble tracking it.

01:05:26.462 --> 01:05:29.529
Okay, but when exactly is
the dark asteroid gonna hit?

01:05:29.531 --> 01:05:31.065
That's what
I'm calculating now...

01:05:31.067 --> 01:05:32.199
including
exact location.

01:05:32.201 --> 01:05:34.768
We need to send all of this out,

01:05:34.770 --> 01:05:38.174
blanket every newsfeed
you can think of.

01:05:41.777 --> 01:05:43.677
We have a firewall breach.

01:05:43.679 --> 01:05:48.949
Someone's hacking into
the A.L.A.T. system.

01:05:48.951 --> 01:05:50.150
Can you track
the intruder?

01:05:50.152 --> 01:05:52.288
Yes, sir.

01:05:55.257 --> 01:05:56.858
Wyman University.

01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:58.092
'Kay. Block him.

01:05:58.094 --> 01:05:59.930
Trying, sir.

01:06:03.866 --> 01:06:05.233
Agent Jenkins?

01:06:05.235 --> 01:06:07.037
I have his location.

01:06:10.739 --> 01:06:11.706
Damn!

01:06:11.708 --> 01:06:12.674
What?

01:06:12.676 --> 01:06:15.242
Barker knows I'm in,
he's trying to block me.

01:06:15.244 --> 01:06:17.811
He doesn't know
we're here, does he?

01:06:17.813 --> 01:06:19.246
It's an easy trace.

01:06:19.248 --> 01:06:22.016
Well, if Barker
knows that we're here,

01:06:22.018 --> 01:06:23.050
maybe Jenkins does, too.

01:06:23.052 --> 01:06:24.217
Who's Jenkins?

01:06:24.219 --> 01:06:26.654
An agent with an attitude.
You don't want to meet her.

01:06:26.656 --> 01:06:27.788
We should really
get outta here.

01:06:27.790 --> 01:06:29.523
I'm almost there.

01:06:29.525 --> 01:06:31.726
Still calculating the exact
size, velocity and angle.

01:06:31.728 --> 01:06:35.096
The density measurement
is problematic, but...

01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:00.288
Head that way,
in case he comes for his kid.

01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:03.891
The rest of you are with me.

01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:11.632
Okay, so you got...
you got everything?

01:07:11.634 --> 01:07:13.333
I got the rocket,
I've got the computer.

01:07:13.335 --> 01:07:14.634
- We're good.
- You're good?

01:07:14.636 --> 01:07:15.636
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:07:15.638 --> 01:07:17.204
There's a lot of
people here.

01:07:17.206 --> 01:07:20.174
Whoa! That is some rocket
they got there.

01:07:20.176 --> 01:07:21.108
Yeah, well, it sure

01:07:21.110 --> 01:07:23.009
made the students
who designed it rich.

01:07:23.011 --> 01:07:26.179
Thing launches
cable satellites into space.

01:07:26.181 --> 01:07:28.114
That's could be
you someday!

01:07:45.802 --> 01:07:48.636
We're at ground zero
for the meteors?

01:07:48.638 --> 01:07:49.971
That's not the problem.

01:07:49.973 --> 01:07:52.273
Within the hour,
an asteroid 3/4 of a mile wide

01:07:52.275 --> 01:07:54.308
is gonna hit
off the coast of Oregon

01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:56.309
at roughly 30,000 miles an hour.

01:07:56.311 --> 01:07:57.311
We gotta call Maggie!

01:07:57.313 --> 01:07:58.878
Tell her and Kyle to get
the hell out of town!

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.146
I can't call them.
There's no escape.

01:08:00.148 --> 01:08:04.184
What about Washington? Montana?
Ida... The rest of the country?

01:08:04.186 --> 01:08:07.221
No! The impact is going to
destroy the West Coast.

01:08:07.223 --> 01:08:08.389
The consequences
on the biosphere

01:08:08.391 --> 01:08:09.956
will be even more
catastrophic.

01:08:09.958 --> 01:08:11.358
The sun will be
blocked out by dust

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.360
for at least a year,

01:08:12.362 --> 01:08:13.360
plant life will die,

01:08:13.362 --> 01:08:14.728
temperatures will plummet...

01:08:14.730 --> 01:08:15.795
there's nowhere to run!

01:08:15.797 --> 01:08:17.898
We can contact the military.

01:08:17.899 --> 01:08:18.765
They can nuke it!

01:08:18.767 --> 01:08:20.033
- Blow it up!
- Yes!

01:08:20.035 --> 01:08:21.769
I'm not exactly
on their Christmas list.

01:08:21.770 --> 01:08:23.403
Even if they would listen to us,
there's not enough time.

01:08:23.404 --> 01:08:24.805
It's too close!

01:08:24.807 --> 01:08:26.974
And we have
another problem.

01:08:26.975 --> 01:08:28.242
Another problem?

01:08:28.243 --> 01:08:29.777
What else could
there possibly be?

01:08:29.779 --> 01:08:32.145
The last of GX210
is about to hit us.

01:08:32.147 --> 01:08:33.381
So are you telling me

01:08:33.383 --> 01:08:35.783
that <i>if</i> we survive the meteors,

01:08:35.785 --> 01:08:37.716
we're just gonna wait around
to get hit by the big one?

01:08:37.719 --> 01:08:39.955
We have to try
to convince them!

01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:43.823
I may have an idea.

01:08:43.825 --> 01:08:45.091
Do you still have that piece
of meteorite I gave you?

01:08:45.093 --> 01:08:46.426
Yeah. Right over here.

01:08:46.428 --> 01:08:49.863
I need to get back
into the chemistry lab.

01:08:49.865 --> 01:08:51.265
All right,
flood all the data

01:08:51.267 --> 01:08:52.966
to your online contacts.

01:08:52.968 --> 01:08:54.435
Do you remember
how to get there?

01:08:54.437 --> 01:08:57.837
I think so.

01:08:57.839 --> 01:08:59.238
What're we going to do?

01:08:59.241 --> 01:09:00.305
If we can't blow up
that monster,

01:09:00.308 --> 01:09:02.009
maybe we can shrink it.

01:09:02.011 --> 01:09:03.109
What? How?

01:09:03.111 --> 01:09:05.314
I'll explain later.
Come on!

01:09:06.883 --> 01:09:08.015
Be careful.

01:09:08.017 --> 01:09:11.020
You too.

01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:38.310
There are so many here.

01:09:38.313 --> 01:09:40.715
Hey.

01:09:40.716 --> 01:09:43.086
- Do you want to...
- Yeah.

01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:46.953
Thank you.

01:09:46.955 --> 01:09:48.723
Thanks.

01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:51.826
Thank you.

01:09:51.828 --> 01:09:55.195
Hey. He's gonna
be here. Okay?

01:09:55.197 --> 01:09:56.963
Let's go get set up.

01:10:09.044 --> 01:10:10.000
Okay. We're looking
for hydrochloric acid.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:10.810
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to
Okay. We're looking
for hydrochloric acid.

01:10:10.812 --> 01:10:13.215
Hydrochloric
acid...
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:13.215 --> 01:10:15.051
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:15.051 --> 01:10:18.018
Do you remember that acid bomb
I made in the 11th grade?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:18.018 --> 01:10:18.020
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.920
Yeah, you took out
a row of lockers.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:19.922 --> 01:10:21.255
You were lucky
no one was hurt.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:21.257 --> 01:10:22.000
I was hurt.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.123
I was hurt.

01:10:23.125 --> 01:10:25.326
Got second-degree burns.
Still got the scars.

01:10:25.328 --> 01:10:28.328
No one's fault
but your own.

01:10:28.330 --> 01:10:29.462
Grab me that cart.

01:10:29.464 --> 01:10:31.165
Unbelievable.

01:10:31.167 --> 01:10:33.100
That was 20 years ago,

01:10:33.102 --> 01:10:36.039
and you're still
lecturing me about it.

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:39.506
I'm sorry.
What was your point?

01:10:39.508 --> 01:10:40.975
How is
hydrochloric acid

01:10:40.977 --> 01:10:43.443
supposed to shrink
an asteroid?

01:10:43.445 --> 01:10:46.281
You may need this.

01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:50.850
Now, when I tested
the meteorite before...

01:10:50.852 --> 01:10:53.787
ammonia reacted to trace
elements of sodium phosphide.

01:10:53.789 --> 01:10:56.191
It caused the sample
to expand rapidly.

01:11:01.364 --> 01:11:04.832
Acid molecules
are ionized water...

01:11:04.834 --> 01:11:06.500
sodium phosphide is ionic.

01:11:06.502 --> 01:11:08.568
The two together
should cancel one another out

01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:10.336
and cause the meteor to shrink.

01:11:10.338 --> 01:11:11.971
"Should"?

01:11:11.973 --> 01:11:14.440
Yeah, I know it's a long shot,
but...

01:11:14.442 --> 01:11:17.046
You should stand back.

01:11:22.517 --> 01:11:24.620
Whoa!

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:31.591
It's gone!

01:11:31.593 --> 01:11:33.060
No, it imploded.

01:11:33.062 --> 01:11:34.095
Instantaneous chain reaction!

01:11:34.097 --> 01:11:36.564
Okay, but can it take out
an entire asteroid?

01:11:36.566 --> 01:11:37.431
Yeah, it might,

01:11:37.433 --> 01:11:39.033
if we had
the right delivery system.

01:11:39.035 --> 01:11:40.234
Well,
in that case,

01:11:40.236 --> 01:11:42.869
why don't we just go over
to Kyle's rocket competition?

01:11:42.871 --> 01:11:45.506
That's a great idea!

01:11:45.508 --> 01:11:47.006
Come on!

01:11:47.008 --> 01:11:49.342
What? I was kidding!
They're children!

01:12:00.589 --> 01:12:02.857
There she is!

01:12:02.859 --> 01:12:05.094
Move, move!

01:12:17.874 --> 01:12:19.340
Where are they?

01:12:19.342 --> 01:12:20.440
Who?

01:12:20.442 --> 01:12:22.076
The Thomas brothers.
Where are they?

01:12:22.078 --> 01:12:24.345
Sorry, I don't know
who you're talking about.

01:12:24.347 --> 01:12:25.945
Talk,

01:12:25.947 --> 01:12:27.948
or I'll arrest you
for abetting a felon

01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:30.286
and inciting a riot
at a federal building.

01:12:41.563 --> 01:12:43.396
Stay here and don't
let her touch anything.

01:12:43.398 --> 01:12:46.634
You two are with me.

01:12:58.414 --> 01:13:01.314
Come on, Steve. Pick up.

01:13:01.316 --> 01:13:02.483
<i>Hey, it's Steve.</i>

01:13:02.485 --> 01:13:06.386
<i>I'm not here
so leave me a message.</i>

01:13:06.388 --> 01:13:08.354
You talk to him?

01:13:08.356 --> 01:13:10.591
No, Hon',
he didn't answer.

01:13:10.593 --> 01:13:13.496
Okay, well, what
about Uncle Bill?

01:13:15.196 --> 01:13:17.264
No.

01:13:19.401 --> 01:13:21.503
I'm sorry.
I'll keep trying him.

01:14:59.134 --> 01:15:00.266
When you said
"within an hour"

01:15:00.268 --> 01:15:02.269
I thought you meant,
you know, an hour.

01:15:02.271 --> 01:15:03.804
This is
the remains of GX210.

01:15:03.806 --> 01:15:06.239
The asteroid's
still coming!

01:15:06.241 --> 01:15:08.509
Don't move!

01:15:08.511 --> 01:15:10.580
Everybody on the floor!

01:15:27.562 --> 01:15:30.432
Go!

01:15:47.282 --> 01:15:49.382
Detective! Do you copy?
Do you copy?

01:15:49.384 --> 01:15:51.318
You have to let me go!
We're going to die in here!

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:52.318
Just stay there!

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.823
We're not going anywhere
until I get an order!

01:16:09.137 --> 01:16:10.570
Detective!
What's your 20?

01:16:21.450 --> 01:16:23.619
- Over here!
- Sandra!

01:16:28.757 --> 01:16:30.224
Oh!

01:16:30.226 --> 01:16:31.792
Go! Get out of here!

01:16:31.794 --> 01:16:34.193
Bill! Don't!

01:16:34.195 --> 01:16:35.828
Bill!

01:16:39.834 --> 01:16:41.400
No!

01:16:41.402 --> 01:16:44.738
Go!

01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:47.875
Everybody down!

01:17:07.228 --> 01:17:10.264
Shut it down.
Shut it down, now!

01:17:10.266 --> 01:17:12.698
Sir! There's an e-mail
flooding our network.

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:14.268
It's a warning from Steve Thomas

01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:15.601
about some kind of
incoming asteroid.

01:17:15.603 --> 01:17:17.637
Bring it up!

01:17:24.746 --> 01:17:26.212
Oh, God.

01:17:26.214 --> 01:17:28.683
What have I done?

01:17:48.637 --> 01:17:51.040
Cut him off!

01:18:00.682 --> 01:18:01.948
Mom!

01:18:01.950 --> 01:18:04.784
Hey! Stay close!
Stay with me.

01:18:04.786 --> 01:18:05.885
What about Dad?

01:18:05.887 --> 01:18:07.220
Your dad will
find us, okay?

01:18:07.222 --> 01:18:08.555
We cannot stay in here.

01:18:08.557 --> 01:18:09.792
This way! This way.

01:18:17.266 --> 01:18:19.469
Give it up, Thomas!

01:19:04.679 --> 01:19:06.747
- Dad!
- Oh!

01:19:10.785 --> 01:19:13.789
I thought
I lost you two.

01:19:16.892 --> 01:19:20.662
How long
is this gonna last?

01:19:47.789 --> 01:19:48.988
Is it over?

01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:52.626
No.

01:19:57.566 --> 01:20:00.636
It's not over.

01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:10.012
Uh... guys?

01:20:11.646 --> 01:20:13.412
What's that?

01:20:13.414 --> 01:20:16.785
It's a planet-killer.

01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:22.555
Maggie,
I'm sorry for everything,

01:20:22.557 --> 01:20:25.792
but I think I can stop this
with this chemical reaction.

01:20:25.794 --> 01:20:28.028
Gonna need your help, bud.

01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:30.529
Is there anything here that can
carry a three-pound payload

01:20:30.531 --> 01:20:32.064
to a 10,000-kilometer range?

01:20:32.066 --> 01:20:33.433
There's only
one rocket here

01:20:33.435 --> 01:20:34.568
that can reach
that altitude.

01:20:34.570 --> 01:20:35.668
Take me to it.
Come on! Let's go!

01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:37.906
Let's go. Come on.

01:20:41.944 --> 01:20:43.844
It uses a ramjet engine.

01:20:43.846 --> 01:20:45.444
It's fully loaded for launch.

01:20:45.446 --> 01:20:47.381
I think I can access
its operating system.

01:20:47.383 --> 01:20:52.118
Here is all the data,
including trajectory.

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:54.086
Okay, help me
brace this.

01:20:54.088 --> 01:20:55.087
Can you hold it?

01:20:55.089 --> 01:20:56.825
Right there.

01:20:58.526 --> 01:21:00.127
We only get one shot at this,
don't we?

01:21:00.129 --> 01:21:02.131
We'll make it count.

01:21:09.170 --> 01:21:12.773
General, the...
the asteroid is too damn big.

01:21:12.775 --> 01:21:14.073
Even if we do nuke it,

01:21:14.075 --> 01:21:16.646
the resulting debris
would kill us.

01:21:17.945 --> 01:21:20.180
Yes, sir.

01:21:20.182 --> 01:21:22.015
I understand.

01:21:22.017 --> 01:21:24.887
Asteroid will impact
in five minutes.

01:21:45.574 --> 01:21:47.207
I'm in.

01:21:47.209 --> 01:21:49.743
Okay. Great. Now you have
to target the Asteroid.

01:21:49.745 --> 01:21:51.912
Dad, it's traveling at, like,
30,000 kilometers an hour!

01:21:51.914 --> 01:21:53.646
Look at me.

01:21:53.648 --> 01:21:57.184
You are the smartest
rocket scientist I know, Kyle,

01:21:57.186 --> 01:21:59.185
and you can do this math
in your sleep.

01:21:59.187 --> 01:22:00.519
- But, Dad...
- No. There's no time.

01:22:00.521 --> 01:22:02.488
Now, I need to hard-wire this.

01:22:02.490 --> 01:22:04.890
You have to do the calculations.

01:22:04.892 --> 01:22:07.993
I know you can do this.

01:22:07.995 --> 01:22:10.930
Three minutes to impact.

01:22:14.902 --> 01:22:18.137
I am so sorry.

01:22:22.177 --> 01:22:24.046
How are you doing, Kyle?

01:22:25.213 --> 01:22:26.046
Stay focused, bud.

01:22:26.048 --> 01:22:30.216
The velocity...
and mass...

01:22:30.218 --> 01:22:31.717
divided by the distance...

01:22:31.719 --> 01:22:35.087
multiplied by Pi.

01:22:46.133 --> 01:22:48.269
Uh, Dad?

01:22:53.141 --> 01:22:54.777
Steve?

01:22:55.977 --> 01:22:58.213
Come on.

01:23:08.289 --> 01:23:09.891
Okay, it's ready!

01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:17.197
Upload the data.

01:23:17.199 --> 01:23:18.230
Okay. Ready.

01:23:18.232 --> 01:23:20.166
Launching!

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:34.014
I hope
I got that right.

01:23:35.150 --> 01:23:37.183
Sir...

01:23:37.185 --> 01:23:38.851
we're tracking
a missile launch

01:23:38.853 --> 01:23:40.854
from the University.

01:23:45.761 --> 01:23:48.863
Come on. Please work.
Please work!

01:24:02.710 --> 01:24:04.877
Wasn't something
supposed to happen?

01:24:04.879 --> 01:24:07.046
Wait.

01:24:26.234 --> 01:24:28.838
Thank you, Steve Thomas.

01:24:52.227 --> 01:24:54.728
Can someone bring me
some ice water with no ice,

01:24:54.730 --> 01:24:56.197
please?

01:25:00.736 --> 01:25:02.368
Hey, pal,
I'm pretty sure

01:25:02.370 --> 01:25:04.269
you didn't get
shot in the leg.

01:25:04.271 --> 01:25:05.704
- It hurts.
- Oh...

01:25:05.706 --> 01:25:07.806
Hey, check it out.
Sandra's new vlog is up.

01:25:07.808 --> 01:25:09.708
Good, good, good.
Put it on.

01:25:09.710 --> 01:25:11.010
There you go,
Your Majesty.

01:25:11.012 --> 01:25:12.645
Thank you.

01:25:12.647 --> 01:25:14.747
