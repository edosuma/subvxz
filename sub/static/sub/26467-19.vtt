00:02.600 --> 00:03.875
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

00:03.960 --> 00:06.111
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.200 --> 00:07.200
<i>To the outside world,</i>

00:07.280 --> 00:09.192
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist.</i>

00:09.320 --> 00:10.595
<i>But secretly, with the help</i>

00:10.680 --> 00:12.319
<i>of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.400 --> 00:13.960
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans</i>

00:14.000 --> 00:15.275
<i>like me.</i>

00:15.360 --> 00:17.556
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help,</i>

00:17.640 --> 00:19.871
<i>she changed the present</i>

00:19.960 --> 00:22.475
<i>and now our world is
more dangerous than ever.</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:24.870
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:27.435
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:28.320 --> 00:30.391
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:30.480 --> 00:32.870
- Is my dad even really...
- Caitlin, your father is dead.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.394
- Dad?
- You found me.

00:34.480 --> 00:35.914
I want to make it up
to you, Caity.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.674
I really should've
been there for you.

00:38.760 --> 00:40.536
<i>Icicle wouldn't have gone
to all this trouble</i>

00:40.560 --> 00:43.519
to kill my dad if there wasn't
a piece of him still left.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.512
We got Dwyer,
we gave him the cure,

00:45.600 --> 00:46.954
<i>but another Cicada showed up.</i>

00:47.040 --> 00:48.440
She wants to tell you
her secret.

00:48.520 --> 00:49.874
Someone instructed you
to do it.

00:49.960 --> 00:51.758
Eobard Thawne.

00:51.840 --> 00:54.719
Dad, please don't do this!

00:54.800 --> 00:57.076
Nora, if you try to run back
in time again,

00:57.200 --> 00:58.759
I will feel it in
the Speed Force.

00:58.840 --> 00:59.910
Good-bye, Nora.

01:05.720 --> 01:08.394
You took our daughter
back to the future?

01:08.480 --> 01:10.278
I didn't have
any other choice.

01:10.360 --> 01:13.034
I? It's we, Barry.

01:13.120 --> 01:14.349
We. She's <i>our</i> daughter,

01:14.440 --> 01:15.760
- not just yours.
- I know that.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.069
But you left her there
anyway?

01:17.160 --> 01:19.675
I can't trust her, Iris!

01:19.760 --> 01:21.513
That puts all of us in danger!

01:21.640 --> 01:23.632
That's how you feel, Barry.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.313
What about asking how I feel?

01:25.400 --> 01:27.471
I didn't think I had to!

01:27.560 --> 01:30.120
Of course you didn't.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.395
Of course you didn't, Barry!

01:31.480 --> 01:32.936
You always see one way
through a problem

01:32.960 --> 01:34.155
and damn what I think.

01:34.280 --> 01:35.919
Wait, wait, what the hell
does that mean?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.037
You know, we have been
through so much crap,

01:38.120 --> 01:39.554
we have been through
so much therapy

01:39.640 --> 01:40.790
and you are still...

01:40.880 --> 01:43.156
still making decisions
based on your emotions!

01:43.240 --> 01:45.072
'Cause I'm right this time!

01:49.920 --> 01:52.389
Flashpoint?

01:52.480 --> 01:54.233
Going to the Speed Force
and leaving me?

01:54.320 --> 01:55.754
Were you right those times too?

01:55.840 --> 01:58.400
You think I wanted
to do this?

01:58.480 --> 02:00.278
That this was easy?

02:00.360 --> 02:04.274
Seeing Nora looking at me,
asking for forgiveness,

02:04.360 --> 02:07.353
knowing it might be
the last time I ever see her?

02:07.480 --> 02:11.235
What about the last time
that I get to see her, Barry?

02:11.320 --> 02:13.471
I didn't even get a chance
to say good-bye!

02:13.560 --> 02:16.314
Damn it, Iris,
she lied to us for months!

02:16.400 --> 02:18.278
And she explained why!

02:18.360 --> 02:20.352
That she was working
with Thawne?

02:32.040 --> 02:33.952
That doesn't bother you.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.318
No, it doesn't.

02:41.440 --> 02:44.194
Maybe if he killed
your mother in front of you,

02:44.280 --> 02:45.953
you'd feel differently.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.878
Maybe you feeling
differently, Barry,

02:50.960 --> 02:52.816
is why we should have made
this decision together.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.672
She just wanted to meet you,
Barry.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.240
The father that she never knew,

02:56.360 --> 02:59.558
and there was one person
who could teach her how to do that.

02:59.640 --> 03:02.155
Is it really so hard
to understand

03:02.240 --> 03:03.799
why she would go to him?

03:03.880 --> 03:05.439
It doesn't matter
if I understand it.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.915
Thawne is manipulating her.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.999
He's on death row, Barry.
How is he manipulating her?

03:14.040 --> 03:17.795
You know, if this were
anybody else, you'd back me.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.030
But because it's Nora,
because it's our daughter,

03:21.120 --> 03:25.034
the person who finally
stopped hating you,

03:25.720 --> 03:28.599
you refuse to see
how dangerous this is.

03:29.240 --> 03:34.440
I mean, you talk about making
decisions based on emotion.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.193
Look in the mirror.

03:59.400 --> 04:02.472
All those years without
my father

04:02.560 --> 04:05.075
and you gave me
a second chance.

04:05.160 --> 04:07.994
And now I've lost him
all over again.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.152
I failed you,
Little Runner.

04:11.240 --> 04:15.393
No, this is my fault.

04:15.480 --> 04:18.279
I should've never lied to them
about working with you.

04:18.399 --> 04:21.279
Well, perhaps not.

04:21.360 --> 04:25.115
I screwed everything up.

04:25.240 --> 04:27.232
And now I can't even help them
catch Cicada

04:27.320 --> 04:29.789
because my dad will know
if I run into the Speed Force.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.236
Mm-hmm.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.437
He most certainly will.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.314
Wait.

04:40.560 --> 04:43.234
Wait.

04:43.320 --> 04:46.233
You've run into the Speed Force
hundreds of times.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.960
And my father,
other speedsters,

04:49.040 --> 04:51.760
they never felt you coming.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.274
How did you do that?

04:55.120 --> 04:56.600
Thawne,
tell me how you did it.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.239
- Nora.
- Tell me. Thawne!

04:58.320 --> 05:00.710
It's not for you.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.157
I need to see my father.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.272
Please, if there is a way

05:06.360 --> 05:08.670
I can go back in time
to see him undetected,

05:08.760 --> 05:10.433
you have to tell me how.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.677
I used to idolize
your father.

05:20.280 --> 05:21.714
I wanted to be just like him.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.193
But that was not my fate.
I was to be the reverse.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.351
Opposite of him...

05:28.520 --> 05:30.830
in every way.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.560
And so instead of tapping
into the Speed Force

05:33.640 --> 05:37.270
to access my powers...

05:37.920 --> 05:39.957
I created my own.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.794
You created
your own Speed Force?

05:42.880 --> 05:44.280
Yes, I did.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.272
And I can access it
to go back in time?

05:46.360 --> 05:49.717
That and more.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.837
Can you teach me
how to use it?

05:53.880 --> 05:57.396
Well, I... I have to warn you,
Nora.

05:57.480 --> 06:01.235
It's a little bit negative.

06:13.520 --> 06:17.480
Hey, where is Cecile
and Cisco?

06:17.560 --> 06:19.153
Cecile's relieving
the nanny.

06:19.240 --> 06:20.674
And Cisco went
to talk to Breacher

06:20.760 --> 06:22.080
about how to track Cicada Il.

06:22.160 --> 06:23.560
Okay.

06:23.640 --> 06:25.552
Where's Iris?

06:25.640 --> 06:27.791
Uh, I honestly don't know.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.917
We're not really seeing
eye to eye right now.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.196
Because?

06:32.280 --> 06:35.478
Because I took Nora home
for good.

06:36.680 --> 06:38.433
Nora's gone?

06:38.520 --> 06:40.000
Just like that?

06:40.640 --> 06:42.677
Well, only thing to do,
really,

06:42.760 --> 06:45.355
because Nora can't be trusted.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.837
I can deduce from your faces
that you're upset,

06:50.920 --> 06:53.355
but you understand the truth
need to be exposed.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.080
Yes, we understand that.

06:56.160 --> 06:59.312
What you don't understand
is that this is a family.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.790
You didn't include anyone
in this.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.473
Oh, look. Baby Giraffe...

07:03.560 --> 07:05.472
Sherloque,
you've done enough.

07:05.560 --> 07:06.976
- All right?
- Oh, I have not done enough.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.136
We still have another Cicada
to catch.

07:08.160 --> 07:10.072
Man, he says
you've done enough.

07:12.040 --> 07:15.238
Well, perhaps I have.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.431
I got to take this. Yeah?

07:20.520 --> 07:22.637
Look, since Cisco
didn't take me with him,

07:22.720 --> 07:24.598
I'm gonna round up
the Cicada Il files.

07:24.680 --> 07:26.536
Cecile and I are going
to go over them tomorrow,

07:26.560 --> 07:29.473
see if anything makes
my nose wiggle.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.635
Are you gonna be okay?

07:35.720 --> 07:37.712
I honestly don't know.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.598
Guys, it's CCPD.

07:39.680 --> 07:41.319
We've got a big problem.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.160
The nurses heard a crash
in the middle of the night

07:47.200 --> 07:48.316
but nobody saw anything.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.198
By the time they got here,

07:50.320 --> 07:51.879
Grace was gone.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.555
Judging by the thermal
warping in this glass,

07:54.640 --> 07:58.714
an energy blast with a lot
of heat took out the window.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.678
But I don't really think
we need any clues

08:00.760 --> 08:03.036
to know who took her.

08:03.120 --> 08:05.555
Future Grace steals
past Grace.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.632
I don't even know if there's
a police code

08:07.720 --> 08:09.154
for kidnapping yourself.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.515
Hey, what's it say?

08:10.600 --> 08:11.875
Grace's coma is stable.

08:11.960 --> 08:13.896
As long as future Grace is
looking after younger Grace,

08:13.920 --> 08:15.434
her life's not in any danger.

08:15.520 --> 08:18.752
We still have no way
to find either of them.

08:18.840 --> 08:21.071
Could things get any worse?

08:30.320 --> 08:32.357
Working late,
Dr. Tannhauser?

08:32.440 --> 08:34.955
Or working early,
depending how you see it.

08:35.039 --> 08:36.759
Well, I stopped by
to say good night.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.910
So I guess I'll say
good morning.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.798
Good morning, J.P.

08:48.720 --> 08:49.896
<i>Get back!
Hold it right there!</i>

09:45.040 --> 09:46.599
Thomas?

09:51.120 --> 09:52.395
I don't suppose Icicle

09:52.480 --> 09:54.312
left any frozen fingerprints
behind?

09:54.400 --> 09:56.756
No, but this docking station

09:56.840 --> 09:59.275
is lined with a carbon-filled
Kapton polyimide.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.192
NASA uses it to build probes

10:01.280 --> 10:03.795
meant for the coldest reaches
of space.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.553
There's a lot
of fresh puddles in here.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.871
You think he stole whatever
kept this place cold?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.356
- Try way beyond cold.
- Why would he want it?

10:10.440 --> 10:11.496
You're going to have
to ask Carla

10:11.520 --> 10:13.113
when she's done filing
the theft report,

10:13.200 --> 10:14.839
or Caitlyn when she gets here.

10:14.920 --> 10:18.197
I'm not sure about much lately.

10:19.040 --> 10:21.396
Hey, Barr.

10:21.480 --> 10:24.632
Have you talked to Iris
since she left?

10:24.720 --> 10:27.110
I'm just giving her
some space.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.715
Well, all right. Just make sure
you don't give her too much.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.075
<i>The right choice?</i>

10:31.160 --> 10:32.753
What the
hell are you talking about?

10:32.840 --> 10:35.912
You lied to me for 20 years
and told me my father was dead.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.514
How the hell is that
the right choice?

10:37.600 --> 10:40.195
Your father is trapped
inside an ice monster, Caitlyn.

10:40.280 --> 10:41.320
What was I supposed to do?

10:41.400 --> 10:43.153
Split custody with him
on the weekends?

10:43.240 --> 10:45.357
I don't know. You could try
telling me the truth.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.318
But why tell your daughter
anything?

10:47.400 --> 10:49.153
Funny, I don't recall you
telling me

10:49.240 --> 10:50.993
that you let the monster
out of the prison.

10:51.080 --> 10:54.198
Because you never told me
he was in a prison!

10:54.280 --> 10:56.336
And now all these years
that I could've been working on

10:56.360 --> 10:58.591
a cure for dad are gone!

10:58.680 --> 11:00.672
We may never get him back.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.956
Well, at least you have
someone to blame.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.872
Mom's always here for that.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.196
Are you okay?

11:14.280 --> 11:16.636
I will be as soon as
we find Icicle.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.359
My mom told me what he stole.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.557
It's a prototype Cryo-Atomizer.

11:20.640 --> 11:24.270
- And what can he do with that?
- Nothing good.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.317
My contacts upstate
got nothing.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.437
I even tried Kritschgau
at the DOD. Nada.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.240
Nobody can spare the manpower
to help find Cicada 2.0.

11:32.320 --> 11:33.993
Hey, what about the <i>Citizen?</i>

11:34.080 --> 11:37.790
Any fresh leads on Cicada?
Iris?

11:37.880 --> 11:41.191
Hello? Um, Earth to Iris?

11:41.280 --> 11:43.192
Ralph, wait!

11:43.280 --> 11:47.354
"Barry, I don't know if I can
ever forgive you for this."

11:48.120 --> 11:49.176
I think you missed
a comma there.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.839
Can you stay out of it
for once?

11:50.920 --> 11:52.195
She's not kidding.
Super mad.

11:52.760 --> 11:56.117
No. Look, um, Iris,

11:56.200 --> 11:58.157
I know how Barry can be.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.038
But you guys are like

12:00.120 --> 12:02.715
the Meghan and Harry
of superhero royalty.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.951
Your love is eternal.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.952
- You two will talk and... and...
- We did talk.

12:07.040 --> 12:10.112
I want Nora to stay here,
he doesn't.

12:10.200 --> 12:13.034
How do we solve that?

12:13.120 --> 12:15.589
Okay, Iris, honey.

12:17.840 --> 12:21.117
I haven't always been in the
near-perfect relationship

12:21.200 --> 12:22.600
that I'm in now.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.076
So take it from someone
with experience,

12:25.160 --> 12:29.120
the only way you two solve
this problem is together.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.880
And you're not going
to find your answers here.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.714
Yeah, you're right.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.557
- You need to go after her.
- Oh, come on.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.632
Give me a break.
Have you seen her right hook?

12:48.720 --> 12:51.394
Ralph, she's hurt,
I know.

12:51.480 --> 12:54.234
But there's something more.
I feel it.

12:54.320 --> 12:57.631
She's determined.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.951
<i>Reprogramming complete.</i>

13:00.040 --> 13:02.032
The Time Sphere's
navigation core is now locked

13:02.120 --> 13:04.032
onto Nora West-Allen's
temporal signature.

13:04.120 --> 13:06.040
And you disabled the
tracker that Cisco installed

13:06.120 --> 13:07.679
- into the Sphere?
- Yes.

13:07.760 --> 13:09.752
However, there are still
alarms in S.T.A.R. Labs.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.877
If you wish to use
the Sphere undetected,

13:11.960 --> 13:14.475
you must activate it off-site.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.509
Planning a trip?

13:19.600 --> 13:21.159
How did you get in here?

13:21.240 --> 13:22.896
Followed you then stretched
under the door.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.016
By the way,
was anybody ever gonna

13:24.040 --> 13:25.599
tell me about this secret room?

13:25.680 --> 13:27.416
What else do we got in here?
A bowling alley or something?

13:27.440 --> 13:29.352
Ralph, I don't have time
for this.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.760
Actually, it looks like you
have all the time in the world.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.240
You're not gonna stop me.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.312
Who said anything
about stopping you?

13:41.920 --> 13:43.320
<i>I'm in position.</i>

13:43.400 --> 13:45.198
<i>Thawne, I said I'm ready.</i>

13:45.280 --> 13:46.953
We shall see if you're ready.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.111
<i>Now run.</i>

13:51.840 --> 13:54.036
Now listen to me, Nora.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.589
Breathe. Breathe.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.911
You're reaching out
and nobody's there.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.593
<i>The loneliness is pain.</i>

14:01.680 --> 14:04.149
Pain racing through your mind.

14:04.280 --> 14:05.714
Crushing you, wrecking you,

14:05.800 --> 14:09.874
<i>shattering your soul into
a million little pieces.</i>

14:09.960 --> 14:13.237
And suddenly,
you are no longer you.

14:16.400 --> 14:19.359
<i>You're part of something
different now.</i>

14:19.440 --> 14:21.671
Part of a negative force.

14:33.360 --> 14:35.591
It didn't work.

14:35.680 --> 14:38.115
<i>Thawne, why didn't it work?</i>

14:43.400 --> 14:45.153
- Are you ready?
- All set to hit

14:45.240 --> 14:46.720
88 miles an hour!

14:48.480 --> 14:50.312
Here we go.

14:53.480 --> 14:54.960
Open the time breach!

15:02.360 --> 15:04.636
Ralph, hurry up!

15:12.800 --> 15:14.560
So the Cryo-Atomizer
has the ability

15:14.640 --> 15:17.155
to disperse particles
into the atmosphere.

15:17.240 --> 15:20.153
Particles that slow down atoms
to a grinding halt.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.516
And the slower they get...
The colder they get.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.592
- How cold are we talking?
- Absolute zero.

15:24.680 --> 15:27.400
And if we combine them
with Icicle's meta-powers...

15:27.480 --> 15:29.597
He could plunge Central City
into a new Ice Age.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.273
There is some good news.

15:31.360 --> 15:33.238
I think we can track
the nano-cryoparticles

15:33.320 --> 15:34.913
inside the atomizer.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.754
We just have to reprogram an
oscillating inversion scanner.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.656
Do you mind running to the
downstairs storage area

15:39.680 --> 15:41.717
- and grabbing it?
- Mm-hmm.

15:41.800 --> 15:44.634
Wait. You should use
a modified field array.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.160
There's one in
the upstairs archives.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.720
No, no, actually
the inversion scanner

15:47.800 --> 15:49.200
would work best.
Thank you.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.239
No, no. Not since we upgraded
our field arrays last year.

15:52.320 --> 15:54.280
You know, you would know that
if you visited more,

15:54.360 --> 15:56.033
not just when
you needed something.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.476
Apparently, only when
I need the wrong thing.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.559
- The inversion scanner.
- The field array.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.679
I'll get both.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.353
Might take my time.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.840
You need help?

16:10.920 --> 16:12.070
No.

16:15.560 --> 16:19.679
Is it me or is it getting
really cold in here?

16:19.760 --> 16:21.240
Run!

16:42.720 --> 16:44.677
Two for one.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.914
So who wants
a family reunion?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.071
Hm?

16:59.680 --> 17:03.879
<i>Adieu,</i> Team Flash.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.435
Barry. Barry, come on!

17:15.520 --> 17:18.752
Come on, Barr!

17:18.839 --> 17:20.398
I can barely feel his pulse.

17:20.480 --> 17:22.836
He has hypothermia.
His heart rate's dropping.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.070
We only have seconds
to save him.

17:25.160 --> 17:27.435
What are you doing?
Well, this...

17:27.520 --> 17:29.159
this machine has
a large power source

17:29.240 --> 17:30.959
I need to access
to save Monsieur Allen.

17:31.040 --> 17:33.680
Watch out.

17:33.760 --> 17:36.594
That'll work.
Stand back.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.353
All right.

17:38.440 --> 17:41.000
This current should heat up
the copper wiring

17:41.120 --> 17:43.016
of his suit's circuitry and
we just need to heat it up enough

17:43.040 --> 17:44.599
so that his speed healing
kicks in.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.558
- Is this safe?
- Safer than dying.

17:46.640 --> 17:49.360
- Come on, Monsieur Allen.
- Barry?

17:49.440 --> 17:51.079
- Come on!
- Barr!

17:54.080 --> 17:55.799
Icicle. He has them.

17:55.880 --> 17:57.872
No, no, no, no, Monsieur.
No, no, wait. No, wait.

17:57.960 --> 18:00.316
In time. In time.
First, you rest.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.359
Then we bring them home
together.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.000
Where are we?

18:15.080 --> 18:18.118
In another decommissioned
Tannhauser site.

18:18.240 --> 18:21.199
This site is a little more
off-the-grid than usual.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.715
It's where we kept our
most classified projects.

18:23.800 --> 18:27.396
Great. I guess we are
Icicle's next project.

18:27.480 --> 18:29.437
We need to get out of here.

18:29.520 --> 18:31.318
Well, there's a circuit panel
over here.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.000
I think we can hack it
and open the door.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.311
Neither one of us knows
about electrical engineering.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.437
Our best bet is to break me out
of these meta-cuffs

18:37.520 --> 18:39.000
and let Killer Frost
do the rest.

18:39.080 --> 18:40.760
Don't be foolish.
You'll never break those.

18:40.840 --> 18:42.416
Well, it's no more foolish
than you electrocuting

18:42.440 --> 18:45.035
yourself, but if you want to,
knock yourself out.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.713
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

18:49.080 --> 18:51.675
How did we get here?

18:51.760 --> 18:53.991
I mean, you're my mother
and I'm your daughter.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.151
But it has never felt
like that.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.511
You've always
been cold, distant.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.592
You never wanted to be
a part of my life.

19:00.680 --> 19:03.240
Not then and certainly not now.

19:03.320 --> 19:04.720
Why?

19:04.800 --> 19:07.076
I mean, what did I ever do
to get treated like this?

19:07.160 --> 19:09.880
- What?
- Why did you leave me?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.639
You left me first.

19:11.720 --> 19:15.396
You went to school across the
country to get away from me.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.153
You took a job in Central City

19:17.240 --> 19:19.436
instead of working in
the same zip code as my lab.

19:19.520 --> 19:22.957
Caitlin, you were married
to a man I never even met.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.594
I got the hint,

19:25.680 --> 19:28.400
but don't you dare
mistake things.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.352
I didn't leave first.

19:34.520 --> 19:36.376
What are we doing here?
What do you want with us?

19:36.400 --> 19:39.472
I want what you could be.

19:39.560 --> 19:42.280
- Stop it!
- It's just a small blood sample.

19:48.560 --> 19:52.076
See you soon, Snow Pack.

19:56.360 --> 19:59.114
- What?
- Snow Pack.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.078
That was your father's nickname
for our family.

20:01.160 --> 20:04.232
I remember,
and why is that scaring you?

20:05.520 --> 20:07.477
He said he wanted
what we could be

20:07.600 --> 20:09.239
and then he took a sample
of your blood.

20:09.320 --> 20:11.471
Theoretically, he could use
the Cryo-Atomizer

20:11.560 --> 20:14.598
to recreate the process
that created Killer Frost.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.673
So if he did that to you...
I would gain an ice persona.

20:17.760 --> 20:19.096
And now with
a sample of my blood...

20:19.120 --> 20:20.349
He can create a serum

20:20.440 --> 20:22.216
that will permanently suppress
our human sides.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.072
He wants an ice family

20:24.200 --> 20:25.953
and he's willing
to erase us to get it.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.718
- Hold my suit.
- Oh, my God, Ralph.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.792
- Do you ever wash this thing?
- Focus, okay?

20:35.920 --> 20:38.136
You sure you're ready to talk
to "he who shall not be named"?

20:38.160 --> 20:39.674
Well, whether I am or not,
Gideon said

20:39.800 --> 20:42.360
that these were
Nora's last known coordinates.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.912
You're up.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.429
Hey, bro.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.233
Uh, what a day.
Am I right?

20:54.320 --> 20:56.960
You mind if I get a quick word
there with Hannibal Speedster?

20:57.040 --> 20:59.839
It's just going to take,
like, a second.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.115
Is that right?

21:01.200 --> 21:04.352
Well, unless you got a signed
Shift Change Order,

21:04.440 --> 21:07.797
nobody goes in there
but me, bro.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.633
Only you, huh?

21:09.720 --> 21:12.519
Okay, if you insist.

21:18.640 --> 21:21.314
- Hm.
- Oh, shrap.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.714
Oh. Ooh.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.154
<i>You need to hurry.</i>

21:27.240 --> 21:28.833
This guy's such a dick,
I got to think

21:28.920 --> 21:31.594
super douchey thoughts
just to keep this face on.

21:35.120 --> 21:36.634
Douchey, douchey, douchey.

21:36.720 --> 21:39.872
I did everything exactly
like you told me.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.599
How come I can't do this?

21:41.680 --> 21:44.639
Listen, not harboring
enough rage to fuel your trip

21:44.720 --> 21:45.936
is not something
to be ashamed of.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.120
You're just like your father.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.159
Your light,
it's your greatest strength.

21:54.240 --> 21:56.391
- Nora.
- Mom?

21:57.840 --> 21:59.240
Step away from him, please.

21:59.320 --> 22:01.357
Mom, it's okay.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.318
Eobard is helping me.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.232
He has a way for me
to get back home.

22:05.320 --> 22:08.279
Nora, step away from him now.

22:08.360 --> 22:12.149
Nora, listen to your mother.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.240
Where's Dad?

22:18.320 --> 22:20.391
It's just me.

22:20.480 --> 22:22.995
It's probably for the best.
Come on, we have to hurry.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.276
What do you mean,
it's probably for the best?

22:25.360 --> 22:26.840
Nora, the last thing
your father needs

22:26.920 --> 22:28.752
is to see you
here with him.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.877
She's right about that.

22:30.960 --> 22:32.030
No.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.470
No, she's not,
and neither is my dad.

22:34.560 --> 22:36.313
Nora, your dad was wrong,

22:36.400 --> 22:37.800
but he still cares about you.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.633
Why are you here
and he isn't?

22:39.720 --> 22:41.313
Look, I understand
how you feel...

22:41.400 --> 22:42.800
Do you?

22:42.920 --> 22:45.151
Do you know what it's like
to want something more

22:45.240 --> 22:47.391
than anything else
in your whole life?

22:47.480 --> 22:49.119
To know your father?

22:49.200 --> 22:52.432
To do your best to follow
in his footsteps?

22:52.520 --> 22:53.920
To make him proud?

22:55.440 --> 22:56.794
How could he leave me?

22:56.880 --> 22:58.712
- Wait, wait! That's enough!
- Nora.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.678
How could he stop loving me?

23:23.440 --> 23:26.000
Lia! No!

23:29.560 --> 23:30.960
<i>It's always
the same condescending</i>

23:31.040 --> 23:33.396
<i>"I know better than you"
crap,</i>

23:33.480 --> 23:34.800
and you never change!

23:34.880 --> 23:36.056
<i>She's trying to kill me.</i>

23:38.680 --> 23:41.240
<i>- Who else knows?</i>
- Everyone.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.720
It's time for you to go home.

23:42.760 --> 23:44.194
Good-bye, Nora.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.112
<i>Goodbye, Nora.
Goodbye, Nora.</i>

23:52.800 --> 23:53.995
She's gone.

23:54.080 --> 23:55.594
What the hell do you mean,
she's gone?

23:55.680 --> 23:57.114
- Gone where?
- I don't know where.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.839
I only know when. 2019.

24:00.760 --> 24:04.071
When Nora said you
showed her a way back...

24:04.160 --> 24:05.674
she meant your way.

24:05.760 --> 24:08.355
Yes.
And I made a mistake.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.397
She wanted to go home,
I tried to help her.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.119
But listen, Iris,
you have to find her.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.839
She needs her family.

24:13.920 --> 24:16.879
And that family
does not include you.

24:16.960 --> 24:19.316
But it does include Barry.

24:19.400 --> 24:21.756
She needs you both, united.

24:21.840 --> 24:23.593
I'm only going
to say this once.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.717
You don't get
to comment on us.

24:25.800 --> 24:27.473
You stay the hell out
of our business

24:27.560 --> 24:29.296
or you won't even make it
to the end of that timer.

24:29.320 --> 24:31.880
I like your anger,

24:31.960 --> 24:34.475
but don't let it drive
Barry away.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.597
The only way for you
to help Nora

24:36.680 --> 24:38.273
is by doing it as a family.

24:38.360 --> 24:43.310
Otherwise, you're simply
leaving Barry

24:43.400 --> 24:45.835
the exact same way
he left Nora.

24:48.760 --> 24:52.197
Iris, we got to bail.
They found Officer Jackass.

24:52.280 --> 24:55.079
Think about it.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.674
Iris, please.

25:13.080 --> 25:17.040
What's it like having
another person in your head?

25:17.160 --> 25:18.674
Pretty crazy.

25:18.760 --> 25:20.877
I mean, when she first
showed up,

25:20.960 --> 25:22.360
I couldn't wait
to get rid of her,

25:22.440 --> 25:25.319
but when she disappeared,

25:26.080 --> 25:28.197
I tried even harder
to get her back.

25:29.440 --> 25:32.239
What finally brought
her back?

25:32.320 --> 25:34.516
Family.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.796
She protected us.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.911
Well, I'm glad you had
someone there for you.

25:42.120 --> 25:46.000
Hey, Mom, that was pretty
clever what you did.

25:46.080 --> 25:48.231
Figuring out Icicle's plan.

25:48.320 --> 25:51.119
Well, I recall you
helped with that too.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.476
It's amazing what we can do

25:53.560 --> 25:56.473
when we're not trying
to rip each other's heads off.

26:00.640 --> 26:01.640
Stay away from her.

26:01.720 --> 26:03.279
I'll come back
for her later.

26:03.360 --> 26:06.273
First, we have
some catching up to do.

26:06.360 --> 26:07.760
What?

26:07.840 --> 26:09.479
No!

26:10.680 --> 26:12.160
Caitlyn!

26:22.120 --> 26:24.396
There's no leads.

26:24.480 --> 26:27.393
There's no hits
on Icicle's cryosignature,

26:27.520 --> 26:29.352
no reads on facial recognition,
nothing.

26:29.480 --> 26:31.119
Barr, we'll find him.
We always do.

26:31.200 --> 26:33.032
How, Joe?
How are we gonna find them?

26:33.120 --> 26:34.395
Caitlyn's kidnapped.

26:34.480 --> 26:35.536
We need Caitlyn
to find Caitlyn.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.119
Cisco's on another Earth

26:37.240 --> 26:38.993
and Iris won't even answer
my calls!

26:39.080 --> 26:41.311
I...

26:41.400 --> 26:43.119
I don't know how to fix
any of this.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.759
If I might?

26:44.840 --> 26:46.797
It occurs to me that hiding

26:46.880 --> 26:49.679
a needle
in a haystack is good.

26:49.760 --> 26:51.717
Hiding a needle in
a stack of needles?

26:51.800 --> 26:54.235
That's better.

26:56.280 --> 26:58.431
These are all the cold spots
in the area.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.830
You think Icicle is masking
his cryo-signature

27:00.920 --> 27:02.320
with someplace
that's already cold?

27:02.400 --> 27:03.993
Giving him the perfect cover.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.240
So we just refocus
our search,

27:05.320 --> 27:07.551
look for temperature anomalies

27:07.640 --> 27:09.359
in already existing cold spots,
<i>et voila.</i>

27:09.480 --> 27:12.791
This is great. I'll start
retasking the satellites.

27:13.520 --> 27:16.080
- Hey, thanks for your help.
- The least I could do.

27:16.160 --> 27:17.958
I've got a cold spike.

27:21.520 --> 27:23.716
That's quite a stack
of needles.

27:31.960 --> 27:35.032
Thomas, are you in there?

27:35.120 --> 27:37.396
Thomas, please.

27:39.440 --> 27:43.480
Now it's time to meet
your better half.

27:58.640 --> 28:00.597
Perfection.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.558
Boo.

28:07.600 --> 28:11.150
How did you get out?

28:11.240 --> 28:13.630
Me? I just raised my hands.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.393
You're the one
who froze my cuffs

28:15.480 --> 28:17.870
so they shattered like glass.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.280
Clever Caitlyn.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.636
I'm almost gonna miss her
when she's dead.

28:26.720 --> 28:29.394
No turning back now.
Time to make a choice.

28:29.480 --> 28:31.756
You either save her...

28:33.280 --> 28:35.112
Or fight me.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.429
Save her.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.838
I'm gonna go get him.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.078
Okay, explain again
why I'm here doing this

29:17.160 --> 29:18.674
and not anybody else?

29:18.760 --> 29:20.877
It appears we're a bit
short staffed at the moment.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.376
All right, if it's just us,
it's just us.

29:22.400 --> 29:23.776
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this thing.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.216
- What's happening?
- Oh, great timing.

29:25.240 --> 29:26.856
Oh, yeah, good timing.
Oh, you do this.

29:26.880 --> 29:28.314
Okay, Icicle has Caitlyn

29:28.400 --> 29:30.710
and her mom in some caves
north of the Badlands.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.296
Yes, but the Flash
is already on the scene.

29:32.320 --> 29:34.391
So for all we know,
the problem is already solved.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.631
<i>- Guys, I have a problem.</i>
- Or not.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.598
I need to phase Carla
out of a cryo-chamber

29:38.680 --> 29:40.399
but it's too cold.
I can't even touch it.

29:40.480 --> 29:42.073
All right,
we need heat fast.

29:42.160 --> 29:43.958
What if he generates
a lightning bolt?

29:44.040 --> 29:45.576
He can't throw a bolt.
That would kill her.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.831
Then why doesn't
he just, uh, hold onto it?

29:47.920 --> 29:49.856
- That could kill him!
- No, no. He's right.

29:49.880 --> 29:52.440
The lightning cannot hurt you
if you are in phase.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.392
If half my molecules
are in phase,

29:54.520 --> 29:56.256
the electricity would hop
from stable molecule

29:56.280 --> 29:57.280
to stable molecule.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.456
<i>Creating an electron bridge</i>

29:58.480 --> 30:00.456
that will generate the heat
that you need, <i>et voila.</i>

30:00.480 --> 30:02.016
Without electrocuting him,
he can phase in,

30:02.040 --> 30:03.235
grab her,
and then phase out.

30:03.360 --> 30:05.352
All in three tenths of a second.

30:05.440 --> 30:06.920
Uh-huh.

30:25.520 --> 30:27.576
- I got you.
- I got you.

30:27.600 --> 30:30.160
<i>I'm going to warm her up,
all right?</i>

31:06.400 --> 31:08.471
What a waste.

31:12.880 --> 31:16.112
I wanted to make you perfect.

31:16.200 --> 31:19.591
Now I must end you.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.119
Impossible.

31:50.480 --> 31:51.914
Caity?

31:52.000 --> 31:53.320
Dad?

31:53.400 --> 31:55.357
Are you okay?

31:55.440 --> 31:58.319
Is it you?
Is it really you?

31:58.400 --> 32:00.756
It's me.

32:00.840 --> 32:03.560
- It's really me.
- Oh. Oh, my God.

32:16.320 --> 32:19.677
You're going to be okay.
You just need to take it slow.

32:24.960 --> 32:26.519
Thomas?

32:27.280 --> 32:29.351
Oh, my God!

32:32.440 --> 32:33.840
- Are you...
- I'm okay.

32:33.920 --> 32:34.920
I took quite a beating

32:35.000 --> 32:36.798
but Killer Frost's
ice healing kicked in.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.600
I'm going to be fine
thanks to Dad.

32:39.680 --> 32:41.751
Well, how...
how is this possible?

32:41.840 --> 32:44.196
Well, I saw Icicle
about to kill Caitlyn,

32:44.280 --> 32:46.556
and I found the strength
to break through.

32:46.640 --> 32:49.360
Just like Killer Frost,
Dad saved me.

32:49.440 --> 32:50.920
Well, you saved me too,
Caity.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.480
I mean, thanks to you, I think

32:52.560 --> 32:54.358
I may have finally
banished this monster.

32:58.840 --> 33:00.877
That's good.

33:00.960 --> 33:04.351
That just leaves one more
monster for me to kill.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.154
Run!

33:18.280 --> 33:20.112
Get out of here.
I'll take care of this.

33:25.160 --> 33:27.550
Cool knife. I've got two.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.751
Caitlyn!

34:13.760 --> 34:16.911
Dad? Dad. Please.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.831
Caitlyn.

34:23.080 --> 34:24.434
Dad, I told you to go.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.398
I already left once before.

34:26.480 --> 34:28.949
I left both of you.

34:29.040 --> 34:31.998
Worst mistake I've ever made
in my entire life.

34:33.120 --> 34:35.077
I wasn't going
to make that again.

34:37.120 --> 34:40.511
Family shouldn't leave family.

34:47.159 --> 34:48.879
I'll always love you.

35:06.360 --> 35:07.919
How's Caitlyn and her mom?

35:08.040 --> 35:09.554
Caitlin's still running
some tests,

35:09.640 --> 35:11.359
but she thinks Carla's
gonna be okay.

35:11.440 --> 35:15.912
I mean, as okay as she can be
given the circumstances.

35:16.920 --> 35:18.673
Why was Cicada Il even there
tonight?

35:18.800 --> 35:21.190
I mean, why attack Icicle
and Caitlin?

35:21.280 --> 35:23.840
Perhaps the ice meta were
not the primary target.

35:23.920 --> 35:26.833
What could Cicada Il want
with the Cryo-Atomizer?

35:26.920 --> 35:28.216
Well, we're not gonna figure
it out tonight.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.072
So let's rest tonight.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.719
Are you coming back
to the house?

35:31.800 --> 35:33.951
Um...

35:35.400 --> 35:37.631
No, I'm gonna stay
at the loft tonight.

35:39.120 --> 35:41.077
You are?

35:41.200 --> 35:42.873
Yeah.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.394
We should talk.

35:48.360 --> 35:49.840
Awkward a bit.

35:49.920 --> 35:52.151
So you went to the future?

35:52.240 --> 35:55.153
Yeah. John Stamos,
still handsome.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.515
He'll never not age.

35:56.600 --> 35:59.991
No, never.
Man, he looks good.

36:00.080 --> 36:02.151
So this endothermic
litmus test

36:02.240 --> 36:04.277
would've created
a stoichiometric reaction.

36:04.360 --> 36:07.558
If there was any residual
meta DNA in your system, it...

36:07.640 --> 36:10.951
Would've turned white.
I know.

36:11.040 --> 36:14.192
And it's still green,
so you're clean.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.476
You're not a meta.

36:18.720 --> 36:21.713
Those are all the clues
that I used to find Dad.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.276
Including some files
that I may have stolen

36:25.360 --> 36:26.510
from your file room.

36:29.160 --> 36:34.679
Aww, Caitlin and Thomas'
infamous Periodic Table.

36:35.280 --> 36:36.999
Nerdonium.

36:37.080 --> 36:38.719
You know,
he stole that one from me.

36:38.840 --> 36:40.593
Really? I thought
he came up with that

36:40.680 --> 36:42.512
while he was fixing
the kitchen sink.

36:42.600 --> 36:45.752
No, I thought of that.

36:45.840 --> 36:48.753
Come to think of it,
I also fixed the kitchen sink.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.637
Well, I... I better be going.

36:55.520 --> 36:57.079
Good night, Caity.

37:01.280 --> 37:04.079
Mom?
Um...

37:06.000 --> 37:09.118
Do you want to maybe
go get a drink?

37:09.200 --> 37:13.638
You can tell me more about
elements you invented.

37:13.720 --> 37:17.316
Now or whenever.

37:17.400 --> 37:21.519
No, actually,
now would be perfect.

37:26.400 --> 37:30.110
I know a little wine bar
around the corner.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.357
Heading home?

37:45.280 --> 37:48.671
Well, it's like
Barry said... and Joe...

37:48.760 --> 37:50.991
- I've done enough.
- They did say that.

37:51.120 --> 37:53.396
But you hung around anyway.

37:53.480 --> 37:54.994
<i>Oui,</i> I did.

37:55.080 --> 37:58.278
You were there for Barry
when he needed you.

37:58.360 --> 38:00.636
<i>Oui,</i> I was.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.359
And you helped saved
Caitlyn's mom.

38:02.440 --> 38:04.272
Yes, that's right.
I did all those things.

38:04.360 --> 38:06.272
I should not have done
those things?

38:06.360 --> 38:08.750
I'm just saying
maybe you have more to do...

38:10.960 --> 38:12.679
for your family.

38:31.320 --> 38:34.518
I just wanted
my family back together.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.637
Even if that meant doing
something drastic

38:36.720 --> 38:38.837
like time travel.

38:40.200 --> 38:41.600
Yeah, I get that.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.153
More than anyone.

38:44.240 --> 38:46.118
You were right about Thawne.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.310
I think he's manipulating
Nora,

38:49.400 --> 38:52.279
but I also believe him.

38:53.920 --> 38:56.560
Nora is back here in our time.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.873
I was...

39:07.760 --> 39:09.194
wrong.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.749
I shouldn't have left Nora

39:11.840 --> 39:16.915
or made that decision
without you.

39:17.040 --> 39:21.193
Whatever it is that
we have to figure out,

39:21.280 --> 39:23.954
we should've done it together.

39:25.600 --> 39:27.956
Family doesn't leave family.

39:31.440 --> 39:34.478
Well, I mean, you weren't the
only one to make that mistake.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.919
I shouldn't have gone to
the future without you.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.719
I shouldn't have left you
like that.

39:40.800 --> 39:44.237
I mean, that was the same thing
that I got so mad at you for.

39:44.360 --> 39:48.752
But I know now that we can't
solve this

39:48.840 --> 39:50.638
if we don't stick together.

39:52.240 --> 39:54.038
I can barely
solve things with you,

39:54.160 --> 39:56.311
so without you...

39:56.400 --> 39:59.598
Are we making jokes already?
Really?

40:02.640 --> 40:04.711
Let's bring our kid home.

40:08.360 --> 40:11.273
There's something else
that I wanted to tell you.

40:12.400 --> 40:17.077
Barry, the way that Thawne
looks when he talks about Nora.

40:19.160 --> 40:21.755
I've only ever seen that
in one other person.

40:23.120 --> 40:24.270
You.
