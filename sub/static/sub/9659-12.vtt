00:11.757 --> 00:13.316

00:13.317 --> 00:15.996

TYLER: It's a very surreal

04:43.006 --> 04:46.515
I know that the other two teams
are bringing their A-game

04:46.516 --> 04:48.765

this entire thing.

04:48.766 --> 04:50.325

MATT: It's going to take a lot
to beat these teams

04:55.366 --> 04:57.605
but we've been talking a lot
about our communication

04:57.606 --> 05:00.805

stronger as the legs progress.

Korey and Tyler,

05:52.366 --> 05:54.726

like, neck and neck in first place.

05:55.766 --> 05:57.485
Today is going to be the day
we get our first first.

05:57.486 --> 06:00.006
Yeah, this will be our first first.
-The only first that matters.

06:02.206 --> 06:03.725

It's right there.

it's at top of the stairs?

06:18.326 --> 06:19.365
Do you think it's up here?

06:19.366 --> 06:21.405
I mean, we'd better just check.

-Alright. I'm going to do it.

afraid of heights,

07:28.966 --> 07:30.525

This is all you. -OK, I got it.

07:34.166 --> 07:35.725
You've got it, Mom.

Dude, I think it is down there.

07:39.806 --> 07:41.565
Ah, dammit.

We were, like, why did
the other teams not pick this guy?

07:56.766 --> 08:00.965
Because he was tall and handsome
and his smile...

08:00.966 --> 08:02.806
..he was everything.

08:05.046 --> 08:07.085

09:17.726 --> 09:20.005
Alright, "Take a helicopter ride

09:20.006 --> 09:21.566
"up the coastline to Santa Barbara."

09:22.846 --> 09:24.725
Dana and Matt now have the lead

09:24.726 --> 09:26.485
and will fly 90 miles north

09:26.486 --> 09:28.445
to the city of Santa Barbara.

09:28.446 --> 09:30.365
<i>Once there,
they will find their next clue</i>

09:30.366 --> 09:33.285
<i>hidden somewhere in this maze
of colourful boats</i>

09:33.286 --> 09:35.285
<i>on board the Theresa Ann,</i>

09:35.286 --> 09:36.485
<i>in the hands of this fisherman.</i>

09:36.486 --> 09:38.565
Matt's favourite place
is Santa Barbara.

09:38.566 --> 09:40.795
Oh, my gosh. This leg keeps getting
better and better.

09:40.796 --> 09:42.285
Oh, my God.

09:42.286 --> 09:43.485
I know he's nervous

09:43.486 --> 09:47.485
about his jumping ability
and his depth perception.

09:47.486 --> 09:49.795
It looks kind of far.

09:49.796 --> 09:50.915
He's feeling good though

09:50.916 --> 09:54.035
'cause he got
a really cute jump instructor.

09:54.036 --> 09:57.246
His future husband is going to help
him jump off the building.

09:58.246 --> 09:59.365
Oh, man.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.885
Whoo!
-Alright.

10:00.886 --> 10:03.365
This is cool. Are you taking us
to Santa Barbara?

10:03.366 --> 10:04.965
You've got it, Sheri.

10:04.966 --> 10:06.885
Let's go, Sheri.
Oh. (SOBS)

10:06.886 --> 10:08.565
We'll see if Sheri gets it
on her first jump.

10:08.566 --> 10:09.915
(WHIMPERS)

10:09.916 --> 10:11.155
Oh, my God.

10:11.156 --> 10:13.035
I'm so scared.

10:13.036 --> 10:14.765
I don't know if I can look.

10:14.766 --> 10:15.965
I don't know if I can look.

10:15.966 --> 10:18.085
That's so far.

10:18.086 --> 10:20.685
Oh, my God.

10:20.686 --> 10:22.155
Oh, God.

10:22.156 --> 10:24.005
Oh, my God, I'm so scared.

10:24.006 --> 10:25.915
(CRIES)

10:25.916 --> 10:27.005
Oh, my God.

10:27.006 --> 10:28.365
Oh, my God!

10:28.366 --> 10:30.885
I don't know if I can do this.

10:30.886 --> 10:32.726
(CRIES)

10:37.329 --> 10:38.648
Oh, my God.

10:38.649 --> 10:40.328
That's so far.

10:40.329 --> 10:41.528
Oh, God.

10:41.529 --> 10:43.008
Oh, my God. I'm so scared.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.968
(CRIES)

10:44.969 --> 10:46.238
Oh, my God.

10:46.239 --> 10:47.598
Oh, my God!

10:47.599 --> 10:49.089
I don't know if I can do this.

10:50.889 --> 10:52.288
You've got it, Mom!

10:52.289 --> 10:54.238
Don't worry,
you're going to be fine.

10:54.239 --> 10:58.368
(CRIES)

10:58.369 --> 10:59.728
I can't even look.

10:59.729 --> 11:01.009
I'm just so nervous.

11:05.409 --> 11:07.168
Oh!

11:07.169 --> 11:09.368
Mom, good try. Good try.

11:09.369 --> 11:12.048
(CRIES)

11:12.049 --> 11:14.168
Yeah, Sheri missed it
on her first go.

11:14.169 --> 11:16.368
She just didn't really jump
that much.

11:16.369 --> 11:18.008
It's, honestly,
it's a lot of a head game.

11:18.009 --> 11:19.728
(SOBS)

11:19.729 --> 11:20.888
It's just so scary.

11:20.889 --> 11:21.889
I know.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.408
Mom, you just leapt off a building.

11:23.409 --> 11:25.008
OK.

11:25.009 --> 11:26.128
You OK?

11:26.129 --> 11:27.929
Yeah. I'll do it. I'll do it.

11:30.409 --> 11:33.528
Tyler can definitely get this
on his first try.

11:33.529 --> 11:36.448
Throughout the race we've been
a two-try kind of team.

11:36.449 --> 11:40.608
Today would be a good day
for us to be a one-try kind of team.

11:40.609 --> 11:41.728
Oh, my God.

11:41.729 --> 11:43.408
OK. Ready.

11:43.409 --> 11:45.089
You've got it, Ty!

11:46.729 --> 11:49.289
One, two, three.

11:51.569 --> 11:52.689
Ah!

11:53.769 --> 11:55.049
Oh. Holy crap.

11:56.409 --> 11:59.728
I told you we're a two-try
kind of team. (LAUGHS)

11:59.729 --> 12:01.288
Brandon, right?
-That's right.

12:01.289 --> 12:02.289
Have you met Brandon?

12:02.290 --> 12:04.488
Yeah, he told me he was going
to catch you if you fell.

12:04.489 --> 12:07.009
Oh, that is so Brandon of Brandon.

12:10.969 --> 12:12.609
Good job, baby.

12:14.169 --> 12:16.208
Take off, baby.

12:16.209 --> 12:18.048
Whoo!

12:18.049 --> 12:19.328
Oh, my gosh.

12:19.329 --> 12:21.848
This is so freaking cool.

12:21.849 --> 12:24.128
This is crazy.

12:24.129 --> 12:26.528
We have a little lead on
Tyler and Korey

12:26.529 --> 12:27.928
and on Sheri and Cole

12:27.929 --> 12:30.208
but we've seen so many times
in this race

12:30.209 --> 12:32.568
that a five-minute lead,
a 10-minute lead,

12:32.569 --> 12:35.288
even sometimes a 30-minute lead
can just disappear

12:35.289 --> 12:38.489
so we're going to keep pushing
as if we're in last.

12:41.769 --> 12:43.968
That's just so scary.

12:43.969 --> 12:45.248
With each failed attempt,

12:45.249 --> 12:47.128
the clue was moved
a little bit closer

12:47.129 --> 12:50.248
so that meant that I didn't have
to jump as far.

12:50.249 --> 12:52.968
I didn't realise how scared she was.

12:52.969 --> 12:55.088
I just hope that it's closer
this time so that she can get it

12:55.089 --> 12:58.768
so she doesn't have to keep doing it
fear-wise, you know.

12:58.769 --> 13:01.248
Deep breath, Mom.

13:01.249 --> 13:02.848
You're OK.

13:02.849 --> 13:04.528
She'll get it this time.

13:04.529 --> 13:06.328
There's a lot of race left,
I'm sure.

13:06.329 --> 13:08.529
A lot of this leg left
and we'll catch up.

13:09.769 --> 13:11.728
(SCREAMS)
Yeah!

13:11.729 --> 13:13.968
Yeah, Mom! Whoo!

13:13.969 --> 13:15.448
Whoo!

13:15.449 --> 13:17.008
I'll get the bags.

13:17.009 --> 13:18.288
Good job, Momma.

13:18.289 --> 13:21.048
It was so scary jumping off.

13:21.049 --> 13:22.568
Tyler and Korey
haven't even left yet though.

13:22.569 --> 13:23.688
Oh, they haven't?
No.

13:23.689 --> 13:25.848
He'll get it this time.

13:25.849 --> 13:27.609
He doesn't want disappoint Brandon.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.928
His new boyfriend Brandon.

13:30.929 --> 13:31.929
Come on. (LAUGHS)

13:33.089 --> 13:34.608
The wind is blowing.

13:34.609 --> 13:36.328
That is not what I want.

13:36.329 --> 13:38.569
You have that wind.
What are you doing?

13:40.929 --> 13:42.728
Oh, the wind.

13:42.729 --> 13:44.169
Stay still.

13:47.369 --> 13:49.248
Ah! Fudge.

13:49.249 --> 13:50.448
That's frustrating.

13:50.449 --> 13:53.488
OK, so maybe we're
a three-try kind of team.

13:53.489 --> 13:54.928
Oh, wow.

13:54.929 --> 13:57.008
(LAUGHS) This is so cool!

13:57.009 --> 14:00.488
We're close
so we've got to give it our all.

14:00.489 --> 14:02.688
Who knows how much more of the race
there is.

14:02.689 --> 14:04.968
Lots of time for mistakes
to be made.

14:04.969 --> 14:07.088
We just do our race
to the best that we can

14:07.089 --> 14:09.089
and you never know
what could happen, right?

14:10.729 --> 14:12.528
Totally doable.

14:12.529 --> 14:14.128
I got it. I've got this.

14:14.129 --> 14:15.689
OK.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.208
Yes!
-Yeah!

14:23.209 --> 14:25.208
Got it!
-You got it.

14:25.209 --> 14:26.448
Yay!

14:26.449 --> 14:27.848
I'm sorry, Korey.

14:27.849 --> 14:29.648
Don't apologise.

14:29.649 --> 14:31.608
I think you were
just missing the clue

14:31.609 --> 14:33.048
so you could hang out with Brandon.

14:33.049 --> 14:34.648
Bye, Brandon!
-Bye, guys.

14:34.649 --> 14:35.728
Alright, hop up in there.

14:35.729 --> 14:36.769
Oh, my gosh.

14:37.809 --> 14:40.288
I'm embarrassed that it took me
that many tries.

14:40.289 --> 14:41.608
Put it behind you.

14:41.609 --> 14:43.768
That's half the fun.

14:43.769 --> 14:46.728
That's what you say
when you think we're going to lose.

14:46.729 --> 14:49.608
Dude, you know how many times I said
"Let's have fun" and we got first?

14:49.609 --> 14:51.088
True.
-Five.

14:51.089 --> 14:52.609
Then let's have fun.

15:02.868 --> 15:04.667
Looks like we're coming up
on the ocean.

15:04.668 --> 15:06.188
I think we must be getting close.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.147
Wow, this is so cool.

15:09.148 --> 15:10.987
Alright. Let's go. Whoo!

15:10.988 --> 15:12.227
Over this way.

15:12.228 --> 15:15.347
Santa Barbara Harbor
as fast as you can, please.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.628
Do you think we could
borrow your Google?

15:17.629 --> 15:18.729
Yes, you can.

15:18.828 --> 15:21.197
Have you ever heard
of the Theresa Ann?

15:21.198 --> 15:22.398
No idea.

15:22.428 --> 15:25.987
It's a 1926 Monterey fishing boat,

15:25.988 --> 15:27.427
it sits in the water.

15:27.428 --> 15:30.467
But how are we going to find that
on a freaking dinghy?

15:30.468 --> 15:32.187
We have not seen
any other teams yet,

15:32.188 --> 15:34.827
but we know that they're close
behind us, we just know.

15:34.828 --> 15:36.387
I can just feel that
it's going to be a tight leg.

15:36.388 --> 15:39.268
That's one of the teams there.
-Yeah, for sure.

15:40.868 --> 15:43.227
I still feel like
we're getting first.

15:43.228 --> 15:44.667
I've got a good feeling.

15:44.668 --> 15:46.507
There's so much race left.
We'll catch up.

15:46.508 --> 15:47.787
No doubt. We're catching up.

15:47.788 --> 15:49.547
What do you think Theresa Ann is?

15:49.548 --> 15:51.347
It sounds like a Real Housewife.

15:51.348 --> 15:53.108
I think that is a Housewife name.

15:54.708 --> 15:56.347
We saw the Maritime Museum,

15:56.348 --> 15:59.667
which was in a few photos
that we saw of the Theresa Ann,

15:59.668 --> 16:03.707
so, we think the boat is docked
somewhere near the museum.

16:03.708 --> 16:05.347
There are hundreds...

16:05.348 --> 16:07.667
Thousands of boats.
-..of boats out there.

16:07.668 --> 16:09.867
There it is.
In front of you on the left.

16:09.868 --> 16:13.507
Alright, marked dinghy. Whoo-hoo!

16:13.508 --> 16:14.947
Alright.

16:14.948 --> 16:19.147
We're looking for the Theresa Ann
and we're going to try to pull out

16:19.148 --> 16:20.587
and not run into the dock.

16:20.588 --> 16:23.387
We're still attached.
-Yeah, we're attached.

16:23.388 --> 16:25.707
Do you want to undo that
or should I?

16:25.708 --> 16:26.988
Yeah.
-We don't boat.

16:29.148 --> 16:31.867
Alright, let's go.
Theresa Ann, here we go.

16:31.868 --> 16:33.588
That way.

16:37.708 --> 16:39.307
I feel like you're supposed
to go that way.

16:39.308 --> 16:42.267
Listen to me, look.
This way?

16:42.268 --> 16:43.867
Turn right and then take it
all the way down.

16:43.868 --> 16:44.948
OK.

16:46.388 --> 16:47.467
Over there?
-Ah.

16:47.468 --> 16:50.067
Let's go! Let's go, Mom!

16:50.068 --> 16:52.907
To the harbour.
-Come on, Theresa Ann.

16:52.908 --> 16:56.548
Where you at, girl?
-There's the Maritime Museum.

17:00.308 --> 17:03.868
There! Whoo!
-Theresa Ann.

17:05.258 --> 17:09.068
Let's go. What do we do?
What do we do? Stop.

17:10.588 --> 17:14.067
I need you to move a little bit.
-What do you want me to do?

17:14.068 --> 17:16.146
Hello.
-Alright.

17:16.147 --> 17:17.666
How are you?

17:17.667 --> 17:20.387
Do you have the clue? Whoo!
-Thank you so much, thank you.

17:20.387 --> 17:21.827
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

17:21.828 --> 17:25.587
"Make your way up to Gibraltar Rock
and search for your next clue."

17:25.588 --> 17:28.146
Whoo! That's how you find a boat!

17:28.147 --> 17:30.187
Let's get out of here.

17:30.188 --> 17:32.667
Do you have a phone
that we could use, sir?

17:32.668 --> 17:34.147
A cell phone?
-Oh, wonderful.

17:34.148 --> 17:35.748
Theresa Ann, Santa Barbara.

17:37.018 --> 17:40.668
It's a museum.
-Are you sure?

17:41.908 --> 17:43.987
Yeah, looks like
it's a Maritime Museum.

17:43.988 --> 17:45.227
Yeah.

17:45.228 --> 17:47.427
But we've got to take a dinghy,

17:47.428 --> 17:49.427
I guess, to the Theresa Ann museum.
-Right.

17:49.428 --> 17:51.107
Find a taxi.

17:51.108 --> 17:52.467
I heard ya.

17:52.468 --> 17:54.307
I see one.
-You do?

17:54.308 --> 17:55.667
Way down there,
he's turning, though.

17:55.668 --> 17:57.347
Go, go, get him.

17:57.348 --> 17:59.187
Ah, he turned.
We should've had our guy wait.

17:59.188 --> 18:01.427
We need a taxi. It's not going
to be easy to find one here.

18:01.428 --> 18:02.987
Come this way towards
the front of the harbour.

18:02.988 --> 18:05.148
Hello, is there any way
we could get a taxi?

18:05.939 --> 18:07.849
Oh, we don't have
a taxi area around here.

18:07.948 --> 18:10.387
OK. Let's go.

18:10.388 --> 18:13.587
Come on.
-This was a mistake. -Yeah.

18:13.588 --> 18:15.587
SEA Landing. That's it.

18:15.588 --> 18:18.067
The marked dinghies.
Those look like dinghies over there.

18:18.068 --> 18:19.627
Yeah, this is it, this is it.
-OK.

18:19.628 --> 18:22.187
Hello! Dinghy, dinghy.
-There we go.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.307
Now we've got to look
for the Theresa Ann,

18:24.308 --> 18:26.628
which we know is a museum.

18:27.778 --> 18:30.107
Yeah, that's the harbour.

18:30.108 --> 18:32.307
So, it's going to be one
of them boats in that harbour.

18:32.308 --> 18:35.748
That looks like one of the team's
already out there.

18:37.548 --> 18:39.257
What are you thinking,
left or right?

18:39.258 --> 18:41.947
It doesn't look like there's
anything on the ground.

18:41.948 --> 18:43.497
Could it be that right there?

18:43.498 --> 18:45.777
Do you want to go look?

18:45.778 --> 18:48.707
Hey! Do y'all know
where the Theresa Ann museum is?

18:48.708 --> 18:49.948
No, OK.

18:51.428 --> 18:52.867
Let's go to the row we were on,
I guess.

18:52.868 --> 18:54.347
Over there?
-I don't know, I can't see.

18:54.348 --> 18:55.467
I can't hear what you're saying.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.777
You're saying things,
I can't hear you.

18:56.778 --> 18:59.778
OK, I'm sorry.
Go where you think it is.

19:02.948 --> 19:05.708
Hi, do you guys know where
we might be able to get a taxi?

19:05.792 --> 19:07.509
Oh... You're
gonna to have to call one.

19:07.588 --> 19:08.588
Call one.

19:08.589 --> 19:09.689
You want a number?
I have it here.

19:09.708 --> 19:10.708
That would be great,

19:10.709 --> 19:11.907
could you call us a taxi?

19:11.908 --> 19:14.257
We let our taxi go,
we shouldn't have done that,

19:14.258 --> 19:16.067
we've got a nice man
that's calling us a taxi

19:16.068 --> 19:18.067
and we're hoping we'll get out
of here as fast as possible.

19:18.068 --> 19:19.587
Alright, 10 minutes.

19:19.588 --> 19:21.947
10 minutes, that's a 20-minute
mistake right there, kids.

19:21.948 --> 19:23.348
Touchdown.

19:24.388 --> 19:26.587
Those green and white vans.

19:26.588 --> 19:28.107
Cabs.

19:28.108 --> 19:30.987
Do you know Sea Landing
at the Santa Barbara Harbor?

19:30.988 --> 19:33.187
Yes.
-OK.

19:33.188 --> 19:35.307
Let's pass one team on the dinghies

19:35.308 --> 19:38.067
and then we'll catch the next team
at the next thing.

19:38.068 --> 19:41.667
I just don't know
if I can stand here for 10 minutes.

19:41.668 --> 19:45.707
Well, this is the most likely
intersection.

19:45.708 --> 19:47.227
What if it doesn't come?

19:47.228 --> 19:49.307
Every minute is precious
on the final leg,

19:49.308 --> 19:51.707
so it's frustrating to make
any kind of mistake.

19:51.708 --> 19:54.987
Why did we let the taxi go?
-I don't know.

19:54.988 --> 19:57.308
Oh, my God, this is killing me.
This is our lead.

20:05.059 --> 20:06.258
I think this is the taxi.

20:06.259 --> 20:10.178
Hi, can you please take us to
Gibraltar Rock? Thank you so much.

20:10.179 --> 20:12.138
Where you going?
-BOTH: Gibraltar Rock.

20:12.139 --> 20:14.018
I've been looking,
I didn't see an opening.

20:14.019 --> 20:15.298
I don't think it's a museum.

20:15.299 --> 20:17.018
OK, think it's a boat?

20:17.019 --> 20:18.618
It's got to be, Mom.

20:18.619 --> 20:20.298
OK, let's start looking for boats.

20:20.299 --> 20:22.928
I would love to see some teams.

20:22.929 --> 20:24.738
There's SEA Landing.
-Right there.

20:24.739 --> 20:27.058
Will you wait for us?
-Thank you.

20:27.059 --> 20:30.449
OK, marked dinghy. Marked dinghy.

20:31.539 --> 20:33.979
No. Theresa Ann?
-I don't see one.

20:35.179 --> 20:37.778
Summer Spirit.
-Catherine.

20:37.779 --> 20:39.929
Fuego.
-Lady J.

20:41.139 --> 20:43.018
None of these say Theresa Ann
on them.

20:43.019 --> 20:44.379
None of them say Theresa Ann.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.578
Theresa Ann.

20:48.579 --> 20:50.818
Oh, careful.
-Oh, my God.

20:50.819 --> 20:54.258
Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

20:54.259 --> 20:57.059
It's fine.
-OK.

20:58.259 --> 20:59.899
You want to go straight?
-Yeah.

21:03.139 --> 21:06.778
Cole! Right there, right there!
-Theresa Ann.

21:06.779 --> 21:08.819
Damn, and we passed it twice.
-I know.

21:10.179 --> 21:11.658
Hi, we need a clue.

21:11.659 --> 21:13.338
Thank you very much.
-Thank you, thank you.

21:13.339 --> 21:14.819
OK, go back to where we were.

21:15.188 --> 21:16.620
Do you see the other teams?

21:16.689 --> 21:18.018
I'm going to keep an eye out.

21:18.019 --> 21:19.418
There's a team.

21:19.419 --> 21:20.818
Sheri and Cole.

21:20.819 --> 21:22.858
Ahh, there's Tyler and Korey.

21:22.859 --> 21:24.378
Mom, make it obvious
that you have the clue,

21:24.379 --> 21:25.738
make it obvious
that you have the clue.

21:25.739 --> 21:27.178
What do you mean?

21:27.179 --> 21:28.688
'Cause then they'll think
it's down here.

21:28.689 --> 21:30.208
We want them
to think it's down here.

21:30.209 --> 21:31.658
I know, so make it obvious
you have the clue,

21:31.659 --> 21:33.538
'cause then they'll think
we got it from down here

21:33.539 --> 21:35.898
and it's not from down here. Oh.

21:35.899 --> 21:39.258
They're turning the other way,
so let's get out of here.

21:39.259 --> 21:40.858
Well, we know they didn't
get the clue.

21:40.859 --> 21:42.928
Well, part of me thinks they tried
to turn down that way,

21:42.929 --> 21:44.618
thinking that was how you exit.
-Oh.

21:44.619 --> 21:46.658
Should we just get a taxi,
is that what it all said?

21:46.659 --> 21:47.738
Yeah, we'll have to.

21:47.739 --> 21:49.018
Here's a taxi.

21:49.019 --> 21:50.378
Can we take you?

21:50.379 --> 21:51.978
Gibraltar Rock?

21:51.979 --> 21:54.378
Try and go that way.

21:54.379 --> 21:55.738
You know where it's at?

21:55.739 --> 21:57.698
No.
-Oh, you don't know?

21:57.699 --> 21:59.738
OK, she doesn't know where it's at.
-OK.

21:59.739 --> 22:02.178
Are you going to run down this way?
-Well, there's a road where.

22:02.179 --> 22:04.618
Do you think Matt and Dana
have found it already?

22:04.619 --> 22:05.778
We don't...

22:05.779 --> 22:07.458
We've just got to look.

22:07.459 --> 22:09.138
Theresa Ann.

22:09.139 --> 22:10.658
We were so quick.

22:10.659 --> 22:13.138
Oh, my God, I'm so bad at this.
-It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

22:13.139 --> 22:14.698
Slow and steady.

22:14.699 --> 22:16.978
Watch out, watch out, watch out.
-Just push off, push off.

22:16.979 --> 22:18.939
Sorry.
-Sorry.

22:20.619 --> 22:21.818
Do you have a clue for us?

22:21.819 --> 22:24.098
Thank you, so much.
-Thank you, so much.

22:24.099 --> 22:26.658
(CIRCUS MUSIC PLAYS)
-Ty, put it in your jacket.

22:26.659 --> 22:29.019
I can put it in my jacket
if you want me to.

22:30.859 --> 22:33.898
Stop pushing.
-I'm trying to make it...

22:33.899 --> 22:35.818
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
-Now go.

22:35.819 --> 22:37.458
What do you want to do?

22:37.459 --> 22:40.018
Go back to her and have her
get us a taxi that...

22:40.019 --> 22:41.938
We could be running around forever.

22:41.939 --> 22:43.619
Rosa. OK.

22:45.579 --> 22:48.658
Ahh. Tyler and Korey
just got in that one.

22:48.659 --> 22:50.258
Oh, my God, we're so screwed.

22:50.259 --> 22:52.179
Yeah, but she don't know
where Gibraltar Rock is.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.058
Can we look on your phone?
Thank you.

22:55.059 --> 22:57.178
So, we're searching
for Gibraltar Rock

22:57.179 --> 22:58.818
to see how to get there.

22:58.819 --> 23:00.058
That's got to be it, dude.

23:00.059 --> 23:01.738
Here you go. Thank you.

23:01.739 --> 23:03.418
That's Gibraltar Rock.

23:03.419 --> 23:06.098
Wait, Mom, Mom, taxi!

23:06.099 --> 23:08.738
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!
Taxi, taxi!

23:08.739 --> 23:11.099
Do you know how
to get to Gibraltar Rock?

23:11.439 --> 23:12.100
I can Google it.

23:12.139 --> 23:13.938
OK, thank you.

23:13.939 --> 23:15.858
I would assume that we're ahead
of Tyler and Korey

23:15.859 --> 23:17.338
if their lady had no idea
where it was.

23:17.339 --> 23:19.898
Will she be able to follow this?
-Hopefully.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.418
She's going to have to.

23:21.419 --> 23:23.098
Here are our directions.

23:23.099 --> 23:24.378
<i>Direcciones.</i>

23:24.379 --> 23:26.339
Just step by step.

23:27.819 --> 23:30.539
There's not much more
I can do for her.

23:31.619 --> 23:33.178
Hopefully, we're still in first,

23:33.179 --> 23:35.658
but we know that they can really
be closing the gap.

23:35.659 --> 23:37.579
Oh, yeah.
-It's a tight race at this point.

23:38.899 --> 23:40.698
What is this? What is this?
What is this?

23:40.699 --> 23:42.899
Clue Box.

23:47.019 --> 23:49.618
"Are you ready for some synchronised

23:49.619 --> 23:54.658
This is Gibraltar Rock, <i>rising
a 1,000ft above Rattlesnake Canyon.</i>

23:54.659 --> 23:59.018
<i>While one team member attempts
a 300ft Tyrolean traverse</i>

<i>to retrieve half their clue,</i>

24:01.219 --> 24:02.458
<i>they will simultaneously</i>

24:02.459 --> 24:05.618
<i>lower their partner down
Gibraltar's vertical rock face</i>

24:05.619 --> 24:07.018
<i>for the other half.</i>

24:07.019 --> 24:10.378
Once both team members return
to their starting point,

24:10.379 --> 24:15.098
they can reunite and then piece
together the next clue.

24:15.099 --> 24:16.898
Alright, let's do it.
-See you there.

24:16.899 --> 24:19.698
If I can't move, you can't move.
Good lesson.

24:19.699 --> 24:22.618
This is crazy, we're really, really
high up coming out over this cliff.

24:22.619 --> 24:25.978
Honestly, I have very few fears
and not much fear of heights

24:25.979 --> 24:28.378
or anything, but rockclimbing,
like rocks,

24:28.379 --> 24:29.658
freak me out a little bit.

24:29.659 --> 24:32.858
I'm going out, there's a half a clue
hanging out there

24:32.859 --> 24:36.658
and Dana is rappelling down
the mountain to her half of the clue

24:36.659 --> 24:39.658
and then we have to work together
to get back to our sides.

24:39.659 --> 24:41.779
I feel like a less cool version
of Lara Croft.

24:42.819 --> 24:44.338
Like a scared version of Lara Croft.

24:44.339 --> 24:46.058
It seems like we're the first ones
here.

24:46.059 --> 24:47.778
I don't see anybody else right now,
but I'm sure

24:47.779 --> 24:49.738
they're right behind us.

24:49.739 --> 24:51.139
Go.

24:52.139 --> 24:53.778
Whoo!

24:53.779 --> 24:55.499
Come on, babe!

24:58.099 --> 24:59.419
Slow and steady.

25:00.899 --> 25:03.498
Oh, my God, that's far down.

25:03.499 --> 25:05.058
Maybe I shouldn't have looked.

25:05.059 --> 25:07.578
MATT: Going out,
I was basically controlling how fast

25:07.579 --> 25:09.178
she went down the mountain,

25:09.179 --> 25:12.058
so I just took it out slowly
to make sure she could get down.

25:12.059 --> 25:13.378
DANA: You took it out slowly?!

25:13.379 --> 25:15.418
Yeah, you know.
-I flew down the side of that thing.

25:15.419 --> 25:16.858
Well, I mean, we're in a race.

25:16.859 --> 25:19.978
Good job, babe!
-Stop! Stop!

25:19.979 --> 25:22.818
Stop! STOP!

25:22.819 --> 25:24.298
Babe, listen!

25:24.299 --> 25:26.299
Hold on,
I have to get mine first.

25:31.019 --> 25:33.578
I need you to start to go back.

25:33.579 --> 25:36.338
Can you hear me?
-Yeah.

25:36.339 --> 25:38.699
I have to still get my clue!

25:53.659 --> 25:55.538
You know?

25:55.539 --> 25:57.699
We're in a hurry, we have to go.

25:59.299 --> 26:02.499
Can you follow on the <i>mapas</i> ?
-Yeah.

26:03.819 --> 26:05.778

This is step-by-step directions.

26:07.659 --> 26:09.618
So, go across,
we need to get back the other way.

26:09.619 --> 26:11.498
Yeah.

26:11.499 --> 26:14.218
Did you get it?
-Start to go back and then stop!

26:14.219 --> 26:15.858
Alright, I'm going to help you,
ready?

26:15.859 --> 26:17.978
Be really careful. Get it.

26:17.979 --> 26:19.218
Oh... Careful.

26:19.219 --> 26:21.338
Alright. Go!

26:21.339 --> 26:23.418
Let's go.

26:23.419 --> 26:24.699
Use your legs!

26:26.419 --> 26:30.498
MATT: Going back, I was basically
pulling myself in

26:30.499 --> 26:33.578
and simultaneously pulling her up
the mountain.

26:33.579 --> 26:37.139
DANA: It's hard to climb up like
that when you're hanging.

26:38.379 --> 26:40.539
(PANTS)
-Whoa-whoa-whoa.

26:41.739 --> 26:45.218
It's so hard to pull up.

26:45.219 --> 26:47.098
Come on.

26:47.099 --> 26:49.459
Almost there, baby, let's go.

26:51.179 --> 26:54.179
(HEAVES)
-(HEAVES)

26:58.139 --> 27:01.218
Oh, crap, holy crap, this is hard.

27:01.219 --> 27:03.619
OK. Alright.

27:06.339 --> 27:07.658
Come on, babe!
-I've got it.

27:07.659 --> 27:10.859
Almost there!
-Just give me a sec, OK?

27:12.299 --> 27:13.939
OK. Go!

27:15.179 --> 27:17.138
Come on, almost there.

27:17.139 --> 27:19.379
So close, come on. Come on.

27:20.899 --> 27:23.378
Oh, man, this sucks.

27:23.379 --> 27:26.258
Ah. So close.

27:26.259 --> 27:30.178
Ah. Don't stop, don't stop. (PANTS)

27:30.179 --> 27:32.299
OK. Yeah.

27:35.139 --> 27:37.738
Wow, that was so hard.

27:37.739 --> 27:39.539
That's so difficult. Oh, my God.

27:43.017 --> 27:45.056
It's definitely going to be
something with heights.

27:45.057 --> 27:47.216
I'm so done with it.

27:47.217 --> 27:48.977
I'm so done with heights.

27:50.577 --> 27:52.296
That's Cole and Sheri.

You got it, Mom.

It's a wine bottle.

<i>PHIL: Teams must now make their way

28:04.457 --> 28:06.696
<i>where they'll find their next clue.</i>

28:06.697 --> 28:08.176
We did good.

28:08.177 --> 28:10.296
Cole is not going
to like that one.

28:10.297 --> 28:12.976
I'm so scared of heights,
this is going to be awesome.

28:12.977 --> 28:16.536
Very nervous,
but I want to just do it.

28:16.537 --> 28:19.896
I can't believe I'm doing this.
This looks pretty terrifying.

28:19.897 --> 28:21.536
I'm not going to lie,
I'm pretty terrified.

28:21.537 --> 28:25.057
This is crazy,
I just jumped off a building.

28:26.057 --> 28:28.096
If you're afraid of heights, people,

28:28.097 --> 28:30.536
don't make it to the finale
of The Amazing Race.

28:30.537 --> 28:31.576
(LAUGHS)

28:31.577 --> 28:34.737
MAN: Three, two, one. Go.

28:45.657 --> 28:49.896
I went off course, I'm good.

28:49.897 --> 28:52.777
Come on, Cole! Ahh!

29:01.137 --> 29:03.177
Cole, you're doing a good job, baby.

29:04.657 --> 29:05.976
COLE: I did not enjoy
a single second

29:05.977 --> 29:07.056
of being out in that gorge.

29:07.057 --> 29:09.177
That was one of the most terrifying
things in my life.

29:10.217 --> 29:11.776
Stop!

29:11.777 --> 29:13.376
I need you to stop!

29:13.377 --> 29:14.656
Are you OK?

29:14.657 --> 29:15.817
Stop!

29:19.817 --> 29:21.616
OK. I'm ready to go up.

29:21.617 --> 29:22.936
Mom, you've got to go down.

29:22.937 --> 29:24.936
No, I've got to go up.

29:24.937 --> 29:26.256
Do you have your clue?

29:26.257 --> 29:27.257
Not yet.

29:27.258 --> 29:28.657
OK. Go down.

29:32.017 --> 29:33.137
We're very close.

29:34.177 --> 29:36.176
All the teams are pretty close.

29:36.177 --> 29:37.496
Everyone's really tight.

29:37.497 --> 29:38.936
We just keep racing
like we have no lead.

29:38.937 --> 29:40.696
There they are.
-That's them.

29:40.697 --> 29:43.416
Here comes Tyler and Korey now.
They're on their way up.

29:43.417 --> 29:44.776
TYLER:
We didn't even think about it.

29:44.777 --> 29:47.936
We knew we were in third
at that moment and we had to go.

29:47.937 --> 29:50.216
There was no discussion.
It was just, "Run."

29:50.217 --> 29:52.616
We know the red team
is terrified to do this.

29:52.617 --> 29:53.856
(LAUGHS)

29:53.857 --> 29:56.136
Come on, Cole!

29:56.137 --> 29:58.856
I need you to pull me up!

29:58.857 --> 30:01.016
(GROANS)

30:01.017 --> 30:03.336
Cole, I need you to help me, please!

30:03.337 --> 30:06.016
I'm coming!

30:06.017 --> 30:08.056
Pull!

30:08.057 --> 30:09.537
(GROANS)

30:11.297 --> 30:13.096
I need you to pull.

30:13.097 --> 30:14.497
I am!

30:15.577 --> 30:17.577
You're almost there, Mom.

30:20.817 --> 30:22.616
Sheri!

30:22.617 --> 30:24.896
You're killing it.
-Thank you.

30:24.897 --> 30:27.416
How did you do?
-Honey, we did it.

30:27.417 --> 30:28.776
You did it.

30:28.777 --> 30:30.536
Have you seen the dancers?

30:30.537 --> 30:32.336
Yes,
they finished right before we did.

30:32.337 --> 30:34.136
They already finished. OK.

30:34.137 --> 30:35.537
Ready, Ty?

30:38.257 --> 30:39.377
Pull! Pull!

30:40.377 --> 30:41.537
Slower!

30:43.497 --> 30:45.297
OK, you're good. Keep going.

30:46.497 --> 30:47.737
Holy crap.

30:52.217 --> 30:53.217
Good job, Kor!

30:55.497 --> 30:57.097
Make up some time!

30:59.097 --> 31:00.097
Oh!

31:00.098 --> 31:02.656
I could use some line.

31:02.657 --> 31:05.416
Not too far behind.
-No, I know.

31:05.417 --> 31:06.576
Oh, my God.

31:06.577 --> 31:09.056
So Korey is...

31:09.057 --> 31:10.736
(LAUGHS)

31:10.737 --> 31:13.016
Slow, slow, slow!

31:13.017 --> 31:14.457
Hold! Stop!

31:16.377 --> 31:17.936
You got your clue?

31:17.937 --> 31:19.256
Yeah!

31:19.257 --> 31:21.096
OK. I'm going.

31:21.097 --> 31:22.736
How does it feel?

31:22.737 --> 31:24.097
Good!

31:25.657 --> 31:28.496
Keep going, Ty!

31:28.497 --> 31:29.976
Good job!

31:29.977 --> 31:31.257
(GROANS)

31:32.897 --> 31:34.217
Almost there!

31:36.137 --> 31:40.297
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

31:42.897 --> 31:44.776
Oh, my God.

31:44.777 --> 31:46.216
I feel like we just made up time.

31:46.217 --> 31:48.217
I feel like we just did that
in five minutes.

31:49.697 --> 31:51.096
Got the clue?

31:51.097 --> 31:52.496
Yeah. Are you ready?

31:52.497 --> 31:53.657
Let's go.

31:57.494 --> 31:58.773
There.
You see it?

31:58.774 --> 32:00.694
This is it. This is it. Perfect.

32:02.974 --> 32:06.013
Do you see anything?
-I don't know.

32:06.014 --> 32:07.813
Alright. Keep going.

32:07.814 --> 32:09.853
Yeah, to the left, to the left.

32:09.854 --> 32:11.533
Yeah, you can go all the way down.

32:11.534 --> 32:12.933
Yeah, that's right. Keep going.

32:12.934 --> 32:13.934
Perfect.
-Perfect.

32:13.935 --> 32:16.015
Keep going all the way round.
-Yeah, keep going round.

32:16.974 --> 32:18.214
Alright.
-Alright, let us out.

32:20.254 --> 32:21.294
Where's the Clue Box?

32:22.454 --> 32:24.333
Focus your eyes. Don't walk past it.

32:24.334 --> 32:26.453
Let's go around this way.
-Where are you going?

32:26.454 --> 32:28.213
Maybe over here.

32:28.214 --> 32:29.493
I don't see anything.

32:29.494 --> 32:31.093
It's not here.

32:31.094 --> 32:32.213
Are you kidding me?

32:32.214 --> 32:33.893
We're missing a Clue Box
or something.

32:33.894 --> 32:34.894
Yeah, no crap.

32:34.895 --> 32:37.494
Oh, man. This is so frustrating.
-Oh, my God, babe.

32:39.986 --> 32:41.065
Oh, my God, babe.

32:41.066 --> 32:43.025
We're missing a Clue Box
or something.

32:43.026 --> 32:44.585
Yeah, no crap.

32:44.586 --> 32:45.985
I don't see it anywhere.

32:45.986 --> 32:48.825
I think the Clue Box
was back somewhere else.

32:48.826 --> 32:51.705
What do you think?
-Maybe over here.

32:51.706 --> 32:53.986
Oh, there. Go, go! Rip it!

32:55.546 --> 32:59.785
<i>California produces 90%
of America's wines.</i>

32:59.786 --> 33:05.145
Almost 12 million barrels
like this every year.

33:05.146 --> 33:07.425
Starting with a hashtag,

33:07.426 --> 33:10.266
they must use these barrel lids
stamped with letters...

33:16.426 --> 33:19.025
..to spell nine cities
they've visited on the race

33:19.026 --> 33:22.145
<i>and all hashtagged in their clues.</i>

33:22.146 --> 33:23.465
You've got it, babe!

33:23.466 --> 33:25.705
I swear I was born for this.
I know this.

33:25.706 --> 33:28.865
When we got the first clue in leg 1
that had a hashtag in it.

33:28.866 --> 33:31.585
I said to Matt right away,
"This is the final challenge."

33:31.586 --> 33:32.905
I just knew the hashtags
were involved.

33:32.906 --> 33:34.345
Oh, here are the hashtags.

33:34.346 --> 33:35.625
Beautiful. Museo Soumaya.

33:35.626 --> 33:37.426
That's Mexico City. That's one.

33:38.746 --> 33:41.705
DANA: So the first hashtag
was Museo Soumaya

33:41.706 --> 33:44.625
and that was from our leg 1
in Mexico City.

33:44.626 --> 33:47.586
That was actually our Pit Stop
where we won the first leg.

33:48.986 --> 33:50.785
Dang, being short!

33:50.786 --> 33:52.865
The tall ones are hard for me.

33:52.866 --> 33:53.905
Get it, babe, get it!

33:53.906 --> 33:55.465
It's really going to come down

33:55.466 --> 33:58.585
to who can do this Roadblock
the fastest and get out of here.

33:58.586 --> 34:00.465
We could be pretty close
to the Pit Stop at this point.

34:00.466 --> 34:02.425
And I have a lot of faith in Dana.

34:02.426 --> 34:04.625
She's really good
at stuff like this.

34:04.626 --> 34:07.025
Walled City, that's Cartagena,
leg 2.

34:07.026 --> 34:09.225
(SIGHS) I really hope
that we can make some ground.

34:09.226 --> 34:11.344
I mean, we're all pretty close.

34:11.346 --> 34:14.065
I feel like we may have closed
a little bit of a gap.

34:14.065 --> 34:16.304
It's anyone's game.
-It's anyone's game.

34:16.306 --> 34:17.864
We definitely made up on time,
I think.

34:17.866 --> 34:20.505
We for sure did it faster
than Sheri and Cole.

34:20.505 --> 34:22.185
Yeah.

34:22.186 --> 34:26.375
Come on. (PANTS)

34:26.376 --> 34:28.025
OK. Next up was Switzerland.

34:28.025 --> 34:29.665
Come on. Let's go to Geneva.

34:29.666 --> 34:31.065
Good job, Babe!

34:31.065 --> 34:33.415
I'm nervous to have
the last Roadblock fall on me

34:33.416 --> 34:36.545
and to have the whole race,
basically, on my shoulders.

34:36.545 --> 34:39.665
If I slip up or if I mess that up,
I could lose it for us,

34:39.666 --> 34:41.065
even if we're winning.

34:41.065 --> 34:43.585
After Geneva, we went to Chamonix.

34:43.585 --> 34:45.025
I felt that pressure.

34:45.025 --> 34:46.226
I was nervous about that.

34:48.505 --> 34:49.505
OK.

34:49.507 --> 34:52.545
After Chamonix, we went to Yerevan,

34:52.545 --> 34:54.346
that's the 12th Capital of Armenia.

34:57.626 --> 34:59.345
We're ready to do whatever's next.
We're ready.

34:59.346 --> 35:01.225
I just climbed across a gorge.

35:01.226 --> 35:03.105
I want to pass this person.

35:03.106 --> 35:04.985
Can you go past her?

35:04.986 --> 35:05.986
Go.

35:05.987 --> 35:08.585
We're in a hurry,
so will you get out of the way?

35:08.586 --> 35:10.145
Smile and wave, Kor.

35:10.146 --> 35:11.825
Thank you.
-Thank you.

35:11.826 --> 35:12.826
Oh, my gosh.

35:14.866 --> 35:17.146
That's all you have to do
is yell politely. (CHUCKLES)

35:18.546 --> 35:20.545
I've got three hashtags left.

35:20.546 --> 35:22.225
Three slots left.

35:22.226 --> 35:23.665
I'm doing this right.

35:23.666 --> 35:25.585
T.

35:25.586 --> 35:27.025
B.

35:27.026 --> 35:29.065
Spelling the cities could be tricky.

35:29.066 --> 35:31.705
Some of the cities
like Yerevan and Cartagena

35:31.706 --> 35:33.865
were a little bit difficult
to spell.

35:33.866 --> 35:36.265
After Dubai... we went to Bali.

35:36.266 --> 35:38.665
OK. We went to Bali. Let's go, baby.

35:38.666 --> 35:40.825
I just want to get this done so bad.

35:40.826 --> 35:42.545
Come on, Dana! Go, go, go!

35:42.546 --> 35:43.546
H.

35:45.376 --> 35:46.825
E.

35:46.826 --> 35:47.826
N.

35:47.827 --> 35:50.185
DANA: The final one
was Parametric Design,

35:50.186 --> 35:51.585
which was our leg in Shenzhen.

35:51.586 --> 35:53.185
Shenzhen.

35:53.186 --> 35:54.346
Can I get a check?

35:59.146 --> 36:00.586
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

36:04.546 --> 36:06.745
Thank you so much.

36:06.746 --> 36:08.625
Matt!

36:08.626 --> 36:10.025
Baby, I've got it!

36:10.026 --> 36:12.625
Whoo! Come on!

36:12.626 --> 36:14.825
MATT: When I saw her coming
around the corner with the clue,

36:14.826 --> 36:18.745
I was just praying that it said,
"Finish line - go see Phil."

36:18.746 --> 36:20.225
Anything that meant
that we were close

36:20.226 --> 36:21.545
to the end of the race.

36:21.546 --> 36:23.305
"Cross the finish line.
Run to the lake."

36:23.306 --> 36:27.065
Along the way,
these eight teams were eliminated,

36:27.066 --> 36:30.585
and now the final three
are racing here to the finish line.

36:30.586 --> 36:35.226
In the end, only one team
will win $1 million and...

36:36.376 --> 36:38.465
..The Amazing Race.

36:38.466 --> 36:39.825
Do you see the lake?

36:39.826 --> 36:42.065
Did you see it on the way in?
No.

36:42.066 --> 36:44.895
I feel like we would have seen
Phil or something, though.

36:44.896 --> 36:48.145
We're about to go and kick some butt
doing whatever we're about to do.

36:48.146 --> 36:50.265
This may be it. Go to your left.

36:50.266 --> 36:51.785
Here. This is good.

36:51.786 --> 36:52.865
This is it.

36:52.866 --> 36:55.465
"Who wants to roll up the barrels?"

36:55.466 --> 36:57.105
OK. I'm rolling up the barrels.
OK. OK.

36:57.106 --> 36:58.415
Alright. Bye, Mom!

36:58.416 --> 36:59.865
I'm going to win us $1 million.

36:59.866 --> 37:03.145
I feel like we would have seen it
if it was obvious on the way in.

37:03.146 --> 37:05.225
But it could be, like,
off to the right.

37:05.226 --> 37:09.145
I've got to spell out the cities
in the order that we arrive to them.

37:09.146 --> 37:10.505
I know them all.

37:10.506 --> 37:13.415
Oh! Hashtags. OK. Awesome.

37:13.416 --> 37:15.745
"Who wants to roll out the barrels?"
Me.

37:15.746 --> 37:17.785
This is a big deal.

37:17.786 --> 37:19.065
We've got to figure this out fast.

37:19.066 --> 37:20.585
Use your gut.
-I don't...

37:20.586 --> 37:22.305
Use everything that brought us
to this point,

37:22.306 --> 37:23.306
don't say you don't know.

37:25.416 --> 37:27.505
OK. Next.

37:27.506 --> 37:29.825
So first city was Mexico City.

37:29.826 --> 37:31.415
Switzerland.

37:31.416 --> 37:32.785
So this is all the hashtags?

37:32.786 --> 37:34.785
These are all the hashtags.
Did you study them?

37:34.786 --> 37:36.745
Yeah, we know them by heart.
-OK. That's good.

37:36.746 --> 37:39.665
So two was Cartagena.

37:39.666 --> 37:41.415
Oh, my gosh!

37:41.416 --> 37:42.416
This has got to be it.

37:44.826 --> 37:47.065
There! Lake! It's on that sign.
-That way?

37:47.066 --> 37:48.375
It looks like here.

37:48.376 --> 37:49.625
Right here, right here. Come, on.

37:49.626 --> 37:51.345
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

37:51.346 --> 37:53.415
I see them! Come on.
-No, you don't.

37:53.416 --> 37:55.866
(PLAY THE AMAZING RACE THEME MUSIC)

37:57.626 --> 37:59.465
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

37:59.466 --> 38:01.105
Oh, my God!

38:01.106 --> 38:02.106
Come on, baby!

38:02.107 --> 38:04.025
Whoo! Come on!

38:04.026 --> 38:07.546
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

38:19.706 --> 38:22.465
18 cities, 10 countries

38:22.466 --> 38:26.305
and more than 27,000 miles,

38:26.306 --> 38:30.345
Dana and Matt, you are the winners
of The Amazing Race

38:30.346 --> 38:33.105
and you have won $1 million.
-Whoo!

38:33.106 --> 38:35.466
(SOBS)

38:37.066 --> 38:39.105
DANA: It's surreal. I'm stunned.

38:39.106 --> 38:42.585
To see all the other teams
that we competed so hard against,

38:42.586 --> 38:43.865
having them applaud for us

38:43.866 --> 38:46.225
and to hear Phil say
that we've won the race

38:46.226 --> 38:47.745
is something
that we'll never forget.

38:47.746 --> 38:49.785
There was a point through the race,

38:49.786 --> 38:51.825
where I thought that you guys
might just implode.

38:51.826 --> 38:54.185
Because, I don't know,
from the outside it was, like,

38:54.186 --> 38:57.305
"Wow, this is either, like,
some really fiery relationship

38:57.306 --> 38:58.785
"or they're about to selfdestruct."

38:58.786 --> 39:01.505
Yeah, it's fiery. I mean...
-(LAUGHS)

39:01.506 --> 39:03.895
Is it fiery, everybody?
-OTHERS: Yeah!

39:03.896 --> 39:05.895
We've been like that since day one.

39:05.896 --> 39:07.025
I mean, we have ups and downs,

39:07.026 --> 39:09.935
but we always said that we would
rather be passionate than boring.

39:09.936 --> 39:11.935
Well, you're passionate
and you're not boring.

39:11.936 --> 39:12.936
At the end of the day,

39:12.937 --> 39:15.145
we have nothing
but love and respect for each other.

39:15.146 --> 39:18.345
I think he is
the most amazing person, competitor.

39:18.346 --> 39:20.585
I just feel blessed
to have him in my life at all.

39:20.586 --> 39:21.865
And he knows that deep down.

39:21.866 --> 39:23.865
So if we yell a little bit
in the process,

39:23.866 --> 39:25.375
as long as it gets us
to the finish line.

39:25.376 --> 39:28.415
Well, it did get you here.
Congratulations.

39:28.416 --> 39:30.106
Oh, yeah!

39:31.466 --> 39:34.265
DANA: Through the race
we had ups and downs for sure.

39:34.266 --> 39:36.345
And we just,
we really hung together,

39:36.346 --> 39:38.985
we always came back to each other

39:38.986 --> 39:41.585
and we worked hard to
keep our relationship strong.

39:41.586 --> 39:44.345
MATT: I think that some
of our weaknesses were really tested

39:44.346 --> 39:45.346
on this race.

39:45.347 --> 39:47.465
And we fought through a lot
on the race.

39:47.466 --> 39:49.185
I think it's definitely
brought us closer.

39:49.186 --> 39:51.705
I think it's brought us
1,000 times closer.

39:51.706 --> 39:54.826
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

39:56.866 --> 39:58.375
The last one is...

39:58.376 --> 39:59.586
..Shenzhen.

40:00.746 --> 40:02.265
Is it correct?

40:02.266 --> 40:03.345
Yes?

40:03.346 --> 40:04.465
Oh, OK.

40:04.466 --> 40:06.265
Mom!
-Oh.

40:06.266 --> 40:07.895
Good job, guys.
-Good job, baby.

40:07.896 --> 40:08.985
Good job, Cole.

40:08.986 --> 40:09.986
You've got this, Kor.

40:09.987 --> 40:11.865
What's the city in France?

40:11.866 --> 40:13.225
Chamonix.

40:13.226 --> 40:15.665
Man!
-You did it, baby.

40:15.666 --> 40:18.896
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

40:21.666 --> 40:24.785
Sheri and Cole,
it's huge what you guys have done.

40:24.786 --> 40:26.545
Really incredible effort today.

40:26.546 --> 40:27.625
You've finished.

40:27.626 --> 40:30.585
You've run all 12 legs
of The Amazing Race.

40:30.586 --> 40:31.895
Congratulations.

40:31.896 --> 40:33.505
Thank you.
-Second's not bad.

40:33.506 --> 40:35.185
It's not the best, but it's not bad.

40:35.186 --> 40:36.415
I tell you what,

40:36.416 --> 40:40.185
I think your family right now,
Sheri, is so proud of you guys.

40:40.186 --> 40:41.785
Yeah.

40:41.786 --> 40:43.265
We've really grown.

40:43.266 --> 40:46.625
It's just an amazing journey
to see the world.

40:46.626 --> 40:49.345
And getting to do this with my son,
for a mom,

40:49.346 --> 40:50.745
it's just really touching.

40:50.746 --> 40:54.415
I think they'll be proud of us
'cause we did the whole race

40:54.416 --> 40:56.865
and I think we did it
with a good spirit

40:56.866 --> 40:58.065
and had a great time doing it.

40:58.066 --> 40:59.785
Started off rough.

40:59.786 --> 41:02.545
You know, we were just happy
to be a part of it all.

41:02.546 --> 41:03.665
And now here we are, you know,

41:03.666 --> 41:06.265
it's been a real buzz
being able to make it this far.

41:06.266 --> 41:07.625
And this is our best finish, so...

41:07.626 --> 41:10.665
Hey, we finally got a second.

41:10.666 --> 41:15.506
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

41:20.416 --> 41:22.825
You guys should be so proud.
-BOTH: We are.

41:22.826 --> 41:25.825
You guys have not stopped smiling
this entire race.

41:25.826 --> 41:27.105
You had a good time?

41:27.106 --> 41:28.865
Absolutely. Best time of my life.
-Time of my life.

41:28.866 --> 41:30.935
And you're still friends!

41:30.936 --> 41:33.265
I mean, I don't know how.

41:33.266 --> 41:37.065
TYLER: I am so glad that Korey and I
did the race together.

41:37.066 --> 41:39.265
There's no-one else
I would want to run it with.

41:39.266 --> 41:41.375
Korey knows how to bring out
the best in me

41:41.376 --> 41:42.545
and we had so much fun.

41:42.546 --> 41:43.665
I feel like I won,

41:43.666 --> 41:45.865
'cause I had the trip of a lifetime
with my best friend.

41:45.866 --> 41:47.305
Korey, what about your partner?

41:47.306 --> 41:49.785
Why did you enjoy
running this race with him?

41:49.786 --> 41:51.625
Tyler and I met in college

41:51.626 --> 41:53.415
and even though
he's four years younger than me,

41:53.416 --> 41:55.185
I look up to him so much...

41:55.186 --> 41:59.545
..which is a different
dynamic for our relationship.

41:59.546 --> 42:02.375
I mean, he's one of the most
confident people I know.

42:02.376 --> 42:04.665
Spending every day with him,
working together,

42:04.666 --> 42:06.985
he makes me more confident in myself

42:06.986 --> 42:09.545
and makes me comfortable
in my own skin.

42:09.546 --> 42:11.546
And he's just,
I look up to him so much.

42:16.106 --> 42:17.825
I have been given
so many opportunities

42:17.826 --> 42:20.705
that I never would have thought
to even try my own

42:20.706 --> 42:22.705
and I got to do it
with my best friend.

42:22.706 --> 42:26.305
It's like my expectations
were exceeded a million-fold.

42:26.306 --> 42:28.465
It was the opportunity
of a lifetime.

42:28.466 --> 42:29.865
Thank you!

42:29.866 --> 42:32.465
The Amazing Race
is nonetheless amazing.

42:32.466 --> 42:36.225
We travelled the world
and I'm very proud of my mom,

42:36.226 --> 42:37.375
she did a great job.

42:37.376 --> 42:39.145
We came here
and accomplished so much.

42:39.146 --> 42:41.415
To win is just...

42:41.416 --> 42:43.025
I can't even really
put it into words.

42:43.026 --> 42:45.505
It was just
such an incredible experience.

42:45.506 --> 42:46.665
Love you.

42:46.666 --> 42:47.666
Love you too.
