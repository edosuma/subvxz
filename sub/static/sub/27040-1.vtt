00:52.130 --> 00:55.164
<i>Welcome to
the World Extreme Games.</i>

00:59.937 --> 01:03.173
<i>Up next,
we have Tommy Schooner,</i>

01:03.175 --> 01:06.944
<i>attempting his calling card,
the "Schoonerama."</i>

01:09.014 --> 01:11.249
<i>This is an incredibly
difficult trick.</i>

01:15.020 --> 01:18.088
<i>Tommy is the only one
to successfully pull off</i>

01:18.090 --> 01:20.092
<i>this daring maneuver
in competition.</i>

01:27.934 --> 01:30.334
<i>He's beginning his approach,
gathering speed.</i>

01:33.306 --> 01:35.274
<i>There's no turning back now!</i>

01:44.919 --> 01:47.987
<i>Oh! And Tommy Schooner
is down!</i>

01:48.755 --> 01:51.558
Trash can: 30, Tommy: 0.

01:52.093 --> 01:53.327
You okay?

01:55.729 --> 01:56.997
Yeah.

01:57.698 --> 01:59.198
Ugh. I really thought
you had it that time.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.567
I didn't.

02:02.870 --> 02:04.337
You think you have
one more in you?

02:04.339 --> 02:07.272
I think we've done
enough damage for one day.

02:07.274 --> 02:08.740
You're probably right.

02:08.741 --> 02:10.410
I have to go home
for dinner soon anyway.

02:10.412 --> 02:13.245
Ooh! Watcha having? Steak?
I could really go for a steak.

02:13.247 --> 02:14.448
You wanna take
the footage home?

02:14.450 --> 02:15.617
Add it to the collection?

02:16.051 --> 02:17.217
Uh, we get anything good?

02:17.219 --> 02:18.686
Yeah, we got
some cool stuff of...

02:19.221 --> 02:20.154
Buddy.

02:20.156 --> 02:21.356
As usual.

02:22.090 --> 02:24.057
And plenty of you falling.

02:24.059 --> 02:25.758
As usual.

02:25.760 --> 02:27.194
Thanks, I'll be sure
to use those.

02:27.196 --> 02:27.927
See you tomorrow?

02:27.929 --> 02:29.330
Yeah, first day
of summer break.

02:29.332 --> 02:31.366
Yeah, freedom!

04:37.566 --> 04:39.501
Oh! I can smell dinner.

04:40.135 --> 04:41.336
Steak!

04:41.570 --> 04:42.602
Give me my board, Tommy.

04:42.604 --> 04:44.205
Come on! Come on!

04:44.574 --> 04:46.074
Give me my board.

04:47.376 --> 04:48.874
No.

04:48.876 --> 04:50.680
That smells like vegetables.

04:50.946 --> 04:52.514
Your flight comes in
on Thursday, right?

04:53.650 --> 04:55.383
<i>Yup, mid-morning. The tour
scheduled a car for me.</i>

04:55.385 --> 04:57.251
<i>Should I meet you guys
at the office?</i>

04:57.253 --> 04:59.185
That'd be perfect.
Can you grab your board?

04:59.187 --> 05:01.422
I wanna look at it, make sure
it's holding up all right.

05:01.424 --> 05:03.491
<i>It's holding up great.
No problems at all.</i>

05:03.493 --> 05:05.428
<i>The trucks were a little
tight but I loosen them.</i>

05:09.232 --> 05:10.531
Hey, guys.

05:10.533 --> 05:11.500
Oh! Hey, Tommy.

05:12.535 --> 05:14.170
How was the skateboarding?

05:14.371 --> 05:15.304
Don't ask.

05:15.306 --> 05:16.305
What's for dinner?

05:16.906 --> 05:19.141
It was... okay.

05:21.278 --> 05:23.010
Hey, Sally.

05:23.012 --> 05:24.681
<i>Hey, Tommy.
Looking sharp in the get-up.</i>

05:25.417 --> 05:27.184
Oh. Yeah.

05:28.319 --> 05:29.286
Thanks.

05:30.987 --> 05:32.757
Oh, man, quinoa?

05:33.090 --> 05:34.490
Gross.

05:34.492 --> 05:35.290
How's London?

05:35.292 --> 05:37.527
<i>Great. It's such a cool city.</i>

05:37.529 --> 05:39.562
<i>I'm ready for the tour
to be over, though.</i>

05:39.564 --> 05:40.663
Bring me back anything cool?

05:40.665 --> 05:42.331
Actually, that reminds me,

05:42.333 --> 05:43.634
make sure you come home
with your new board.

05:43.636 --> 05:45.435
We wanna make sure
that they can see

05:45.437 --> 05:47.805
that you're definitely using the
Mark III on the competition circuit.

05:48.173 --> 05:50.239
<i>Yes, Dad, you mentioned
that yesterday.</i>

05:50.241 --> 05:52.208
Oh. Right, sorry.

05:52.210 --> 05:54.412
Uh, I've got some ideas
on the new campaign, too.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.782
I've got some mock-ups
I can show you in the office.

05:57.316 --> 05:59.417
Smells great, Mom,
what is it?

06:00.051 --> 06:01.219
Garbage.

06:01.722 --> 06:03.389
I'm gonna try
to order delivery.

06:04.090 --> 06:06.590
I am calling it
"quinoa-meanwa."

06:06.592 --> 06:10.229
It's got kale,
quinoa and tofu...

06:10.696 --> 06:12.062
and a whole lot of spices.

06:12.064 --> 06:13.398
Everything a
growing boy needs.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.633
And no meat?

06:15.635 --> 06:18.637
Hey, you two promised that we would
eat my way on Sundays, all right?

06:19.306 --> 06:21.675
I'm just kidding,
I'm sure it's delish.

06:21.941 --> 06:23.273
Uh, I'll be back
when it's ready?

06:23.275 --> 06:25.711
Uh, no, you'll be back five
minutes before it's ready,

06:25.713 --> 06:27.078
so you can set the table.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.213
Probably in about 20.

06:28.215 --> 06:29.449
All right, will do.

06:30.150 --> 06:31.316
Come on, Bud.

07:44.662 --> 07:46.361
I don't see what's so funny.

07:46.363 --> 07:48.031
Those were some sick moves.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.301
Tommy, dinner's ready.

07:52.770 --> 07:54.571
Okay, be right down.

07:56.073 --> 07:58.607
He can rush down
for "quinoa-meanwa,"

07:58.609 --> 08:00.811
but I'm holding out
for real food.

08:01.178 --> 08:02.712
I'm Buddy, by the way.
Bulldog.

08:02.714 --> 08:04.481
<i>Man's best friend.</i>

08:04.483 --> 08:06.316
<i>Skateboarder extraordinaire.</i>

08:07.686 --> 08:10.687
The filmmaker you saw
is my best mate Tommy.

08:10.689 --> 08:13.088
A couple months ago,
he took up skateboarding.

08:13.090 --> 08:14.425
I'm not sure why,

08:14.794 --> 08:16.294
he's not so great at it.

08:26.272 --> 08:28.639
His sister, Sally,
on the other hand,

08:28.641 --> 08:30.473
she was the one
calling from London,

08:30.475 --> 08:32.344
she's one heck of a skater.

08:42.388 --> 08:44.623
<i>She's so good in fact,
a few months ago,</i>

08:44.625 --> 08:47.859
<i>she went onto some sort of
world skateboarding tour.</i>

08:47.861 --> 08:48.828
<i>It's pretty cool.</i>

08:50.430 --> 08:53.465
<i>This year, Sally became
the face of Modern Skate,</i>

08:53.867 --> 08:56.570
<i>the skate company
that Tommy's parents started.</i>

08:56.804 --> 08:59.137
<i>I don't totally understand how
all the business stuff works,</i>

08:59.139 --> 09:01.607
<i>because, you know, I'm a dog,</i>

09:01.609 --> 09:03.543
but I think it's working
out pretty well.

09:03.545 --> 09:05.778
Oh, yeah, and that's Alice,

09:05.780 --> 09:08.848
<i>she's Tommy's best friend.
Well, after me.</i>

09:08.850 --> 09:09.884
<i>She's really cool.</i>

09:10.385 --> 09:11.518
<i>She likes to make movies, too.</i>

09:11.953 --> 09:13.754
<i>She gives great belly rubs.</i>

09:14.122 --> 09:15.555
Buddy, dinner!

09:15.557 --> 09:17.792
Oh, man, the good stuff!

09:25.634 --> 09:26.902
Come on!

09:28.537 --> 09:29.938
Dig in, Buddy.

09:31.774 --> 09:32.941
Thank you.

09:38.380 --> 09:40.449
Okay.

09:41.750 --> 09:43.418
Smells great, Mom.

09:43.420 --> 09:44.852
Well, it tastes even better.

09:44.854 --> 09:45.989
George?

09:46.288 --> 09:47.656
- Dinner.
- Oh. Sorry.

09:48.791 --> 09:51.559
Sally seems super
stoked for the new campaign.

09:51.561 --> 09:53.162
I can't wait
to see her Thursday.

09:53.395 --> 09:55.163
Oh. Did she say
how the tour was going?

09:55.165 --> 09:57.165
Yeah, great, yeah, she's
definitely the crowd favorite.

09:57.167 --> 09:58.499
She said at the autograph
tent yesterday,

09:58.501 --> 10:00.233
her line was twice as long
as the others.

10:00.235 --> 10:01.202
That's awesome.

10:01.204 --> 10:03.504
Yeah, we couldn't buy
this kind of publicity.

10:03.506 --> 10:05.173
Yeah, well, we could,
but it'd be expensive.

10:05.175 --> 10:07.076
Yeah, well, we definitely
are fortunate.

10:07.411 --> 10:09.512
So, Tommy, how was your day?

10:09.714 --> 10:11.212
Pretty good. Oh, I'm getting
better at the move...

10:11.214 --> 10:12.246
You know, I was thinking,

10:12.248 --> 10:13.849
I wonder if anyone else
on the tour

10:13.851 --> 10:15.653
would wanna be part
of the campaign.

10:19.891 --> 10:21.724
Uh, I don't know.

10:21.726 --> 10:23.392
And I really don't think
that we have it in the budget

10:23.394 --> 10:24.762
to have another spokesperson.

10:25.464 --> 10:26.896
So, Tommy, you were saying...

10:26.898 --> 10:27.897
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

10:27.899 --> 10:30.532
Besides, Sally should be enough,
she's the best.

10:30.534 --> 10:32.535
This meeting just has
to go perfect on Friday,

10:32.537 --> 10:34.303
I really wanna
knock their socks off.

10:34.305 --> 10:35.972
But tomorrow we should go over
the posters again,

10:35.974 --> 10:37.575
gotta nail the layout.

10:38.844 --> 10:40.011
May I be excused?

10:40.946 --> 10:43.547
Also, Jerome should
dial in Sally's board,

10:43.549 --> 10:45.548
and we have some
backups ready, too.

10:45.550 --> 10:47.585
You know, we don't want anything
to go wrong in the demo.

10:50.323 --> 10:52.557
You agree? What?
What? What'd I do?

10:56.929 --> 10:59.497
Tommy was trying to tell you how
his skateboarding went today.

10:59.732 --> 11:00.965
What?

11:00.967 --> 11:02.566
Oh, well, gee, I'm sorry.

11:02.568 --> 11:05.004
Yeah, you should know
I'm amped for this meeting.

11:05.371 --> 11:07.806
If we wow the investors, it
could take the company global.

11:07.808 --> 11:09.709
I know.

11:10.778 --> 11:11.844
But will you please just spend
some time with Tommy this week?

11:12.745 --> 11:13.714
Yeah, I will.

11:16.349 --> 11:18.817
What is this stuff anyway?
Let me try this.

11:18.819 --> 11:19.953
Quinoa.

11:20.521 --> 11:21.788
- What is it?
- Quinoa.

11:22.389 --> 11:24.958
Well, it looks...
looks delicious.

11:25.259 --> 11:27.359
Yeah, it looks great.

11:27.361 --> 11:28.794
Hmm.

11:28.796 --> 11:29.763
Hold on.

11:30.564 --> 11:31.766
Yeah, it's Mr. Hoffman.

11:33.367 --> 11:34.634
<i>Hello, Mr. Hoffman?</i>

11:34.636 --> 11:36.401
Hello, George.

11:36.403 --> 11:38.538
I'm just calling to make sure we're
still on track for our meeting.

11:38.540 --> 11:41.075
My time is valuable,
and I don't want to waste it.

11:41.408 --> 11:42.709
Yes, sir, absolutely, sir.

11:42.711 --> 11:44.744
Everything is coming together
very well,

11:44.746 --> 11:46.512
I think you're
going to be impressed.

11:46.514 --> 11:47.749
Excellent.

11:48.683 --> 11:51.153
Time is money, George, and I
will not waste either one.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.753
Great, uh, looking forward
to meeting you.

11:53.755 --> 11:54.921
Thank you.

11:54.923 --> 11:55.891
All right, bye.

11:58.060 --> 12:00.060
This meeting's
going to be great.

12:00.062 --> 12:01.530
Are you going
to finish your...

12:01.864 --> 12:02.763
great dinner?

12:02.765 --> 12:04.031
Yeah, yep.

12:04.033 --> 12:06.001
Can you pass me
whatever's in that bowl?

12:06.434 --> 12:08.335
It's called tofu
and vegetables.

12:08.337 --> 12:09.703
You should get to know them.

12:09.705 --> 12:10.838
Can you just eat it
like normal food, though?

12:10.840 --> 12:14.144
Mmm-hmm. They can be your
friends, unlike pizza.

12:14.678 --> 12:16.645
- Pizza's my friend.
- Mmm.

12:17.047 --> 12:19.582
Okay.

12:41.338 --> 12:42.739
I'm late for school!

12:51.415 --> 12:52.583
Wait a minute...

12:53.351 --> 12:54.585
It's summer break.

13:12.371 --> 13:13.705
Morning, sleepyhead.

13:14.140 --> 13:15.308
Hey, there, Tommy.

13:15.641 --> 13:16.740
Hey, guys.

13:16.742 --> 13:18.542
Welcome to the world,
sleepyhead.

13:18.544 --> 13:20.713
Oh. That must be Mrs. Crowley.

13:20.980 --> 13:22.580
Crotchety Crowley?

13:22.582 --> 13:23.547
What is she doing here?

13:23.549 --> 13:25.683
Be nice,
she's your sitter today.

13:25.685 --> 13:26.853
Sitter?

13:27.387 --> 13:28.553
But I'm too old
to have a sitter.

13:28.555 --> 13:29.954
Yes, Tommy, a sitter.

13:29.956 --> 13:31.990
You're not old enough
to be home alone.

13:31.992 --> 13:33.992
I didn't have
a sitter last summer.

13:33.994 --> 13:35.626
That's because
Sally was here.

13:35.628 --> 13:37.763
It's just for a few days
until she gets back.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.833
You can still play around
the neighborhood.

13:41.835 --> 13:44.069
We're just not gonna leave you
here totally by yourself.

13:44.071 --> 13:45.771
Oh, boy.

13:45.773 --> 13:48.173
Nobody in the neighborhood
likes Mrs. Crowley.

13:48.175 --> 13:51.010
No candy, no TV,
no loud noises.

13:51.012 --> 13:52.477
The worst.

13:52.479 --> 13:53.679
Well, welcome back,
Mrs. Crowley,

13:53.681 --> 13:54.847
I know that
it's been a few years.

13:54.849 --> 13:56.284
Yes, it has been.

13:56.751 --> 13:57.918
Tommy?

13:58.153 --> 14:00.086
You've gotten... taller.

14:02.858 --> 14:04.025
Thanks?

14:04.659 --> 14:07.060
Well, everything
appears to be the same here.

14:07.429 --> 14:08.895
Do you still have
that lovely grill out back?

14:08.897 --> 14:10.530
Uh, we do.

14:10.532 --> 14:12.665
Excellent. I would love
to cook my lunch on it,

14:12.667 --> 14:16.669
I'm using a special spice rub that
was taught to me by the maharaja,

14:16.671 --> 14:18.406
when I watched his children.

14:19.475 --> 14:22.209
Uh, sure, you can help yourself
to the pool area and the grill.

14:22.211 --> 14:23.978
Our house is your house.

14:23.980 --> 14:26.013
Uh, okay, dear,
shall we get going?

14:26.015 --> 14:26.981
Uh, yes.

14:26.983 --> 14:29.884
Hey, will you please be good
for Mrs. Crowley?

14:31.487 --> 14:32.755
She always cooks weird food.

14:33.489 --> 14:34.688
It smells funny.

14:34.690 --> 14:36.358
Hey, be nice.

14:37.194 --> 14:40.527
Okay, let me know, give me a
call if you need anything,

14:40.529 --> 14:42.496
and we'll be back by 6:00.

14:42.498 --> 14:43.867
- Thanks again.
- Mmm.

14:52.776 --> 14:53.944
Hey,

14:54.577 --> 14:55.443
there's a new trend
sweeping the nation

14:55.445 --> 14:57.013
and now I'll never know
what it is.

14:57.015 --> 14:59.648
Children... and dogs...

14:59.650 --> 15:02.320
should spend
their days outside.

15:26.178 --> 15:28.245
Man, I just don't get it.

15:28.247 --> 15:30.914
Sally gets to travel the
world on her stupid tour,

15:30.916 --> 15:34.051
but I can't even relax
on my first day off in months.

15:34.053 --> 15:36.955
A well-earned day off,
algebra was a killer this year.

15:36.957 --> 15:39.890
Does anyone care
what I think? Huh?

15:39.892 --> 15:42.394
"Children must spend
their days outside."

15:43.096 --> 15:44.464
Kicked out of my own house.

15:45.899 --> 15:47.898
It's not like anyone pays
attention to me while I'm home.

15:47.900 --> 15:49.701
- Which reminds me...
- Uh, Tommy? Tommy?

15:49.703 --> 15:50.935
- ...why is it so hard for Dad to listen to me...
- Tommy!

15:50.937 --> 15:52.038
You might wanna watch
where you're going!

15:54.540 --> 15:56.975
Scooter! Why don't you
watch where you're going?

15:56.977 --> 15:58.109
Oh, boy.

15:58.111 --> 15:59.577
That's Frankie.

15:59.579 --> 16:01.415
He's kind of got it out for
Tommy for some reason.

16:04.318 --> 16:06.019
Scooter...

16:07.054 --> 16:09.188
...the goal is
to stay on your board.

16:09.190 --> 16:11.458
Didn't your sister
ever teach you that?

16:16.831 --> 16:19.631
Oh, hey, Schooner...
or should I say "Scooter,"

16:19.633 --> 16:21.134
since that's more your speed.

16:21.136 --> 16:22.936
How's your best friend,
the pavement?

16:33.615 --> 16:34.881
Ouch!

16:34.883 --> 16:36.249
Better call the doctor,

16:36.251 --> 16:38.953
someone's gonna have
a bad case of road rash.

16:40.022 --> 16:41.256
Back at it again?

16:41.890 --> 16:44.126
For a smart kid,
you don't learn, do you?

16:44.360 --> 16:47.028
Why don't you just leave the
skateboarding to your sister?

16:48.230 --> 16:51.033
I'm sorry, Frankie, I didn't
mean to run into you.

16:51.868 --> 16:54.368
I'm a good dog, but I'll bark at
him a bunch if you want, Tommy.

16:54.370 --> 16:56.105
Good luck, Scooter,

16:56.939 --> 16:58.906
maybe if they add "asphalt
belly flopping" as an event,

16:58.908 --> 17:00.476
you can join your
sister on tour.

17:01.245 --> 17:03.045
Oh, yeah, Frankie?

17:03.047 --> 17:04.811
Why don't you put your money
where your mouth is?

17:04.814 --> 17:05.948
You wanna dance, Schooner?

17:06.281 --> 17:07.983
Yeah, yeah, I do.

17:07.984 --> 17:10.051
You think you're so much better than me?
Prove it.

17:10.054 --> 17:11.987
You don't wanna go down
this road, Tommy.

17:12.321 --> 17:15.156
Skate-off, you and me.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.359
Pick a time.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.326
Friday, the Oaks Skate Park.

17:18.328 --> 17:19.530
You're on.

17:20.330 --> 17:22.196
I can't wait to embarrass you
out there, Scooter.

17:22.199 --> 17:24.067
I'm about to tell
everybody about this.

17:26.070 --> 17:27.505
Oh, yeah, Scooter!

17:28.039 --> 17:29.574
Scooter!

17:30.275 --> 17:31.909
And it's "Schooner"!

17:34.012 --> 17:36.280
Uh... what just happened?

17:36.748 --> 17:39.384
Tommy, what did you just do?

17:41.286 --> 17:45.056
I think I just challenged Frankie
to a skate-off on Friday.

17:46.057 --> 17:49.461
I'm not sure though, I think I
might've blacked out for a sec.

17:49.929 --> 17:51.428
Nope, you totally did.

17:51.430 --> 17:53.231
What were you thinking?

17:53.731 --> 17:55.134
I don't know, he just...

17:57.236 --> 17:58.936
What did I do?

18:00.106 --> 18:01.974
Okay. It's okay.

18:02.708 --> 18:04.842
You've been practicing a lot.

18:04.844 --> 18:06.945
I can't skate!
I'm terrible at it.

18:06.947 --> 18:08.446
Well, maybe you
can't beat Frankie,

18:08.448 --> 18:12.050
but at least you can avoid
embarrassing yourself?

18:18.992 --> 18:19.959
Oh.

18:31.405 --> 18:33.407
You were saying?

18:34.275 --> 18:36.342
Okay, well, there's gotta
be some way out of this.

18:36.344 --> 18:38.277
Nope, we shook on it.

18:38.279 --> 18:40.247
Backing out now
would only be worse.

18:41.015 --> 18:43.951
I'd be the spineless kid who
backed out of his own challenge.

18:44.253 --> 18:45.419
Yeah...

18:46.988 --> 18:48.255
We have to move.

18:48.857 --> 18:50.057
I hear Vancouver's nice
this time of year.

18:51.393 --> 18:54.728
I can't go to Canada,
I don't have a passport.

18:54.730 --> 18:56.863
I do love
Canadian bacon, though.

18:56.865 --> 18:59.033
Well, now I think
you might be overreacting.

18:59.334 --> 19:01.704
Do they have skateboarding
in Paraguay?

19:03.506 --> 19:05.338
They do.

19:05.340 --> 19:07.508
There's literally nowhere
on Earth I can escape this.

19:07.510 --> 19:08.808
Tommy!

19:08.810 --> 19:10.545
Five more minutes in the room!

19:10.779 --> 19:13.716
Don't want that computer
rotting your brain!

19:17.052 --> 19:18.956
Crazy Crowley's gonna kick
me out of the house again.

19:19.923 --> 19:21.424
I can't even hide, how does
she always know where I am?

19:22.292 --> 19:24.227
Well, she is a babysitter,
and that's kind of her job.

19:30.366 --> 19:32.101
Ah.

19:32.336 --> 19:33.504
She's ready.

19:58.296 --> 20:00.030
W-What? It...

20:00.332 --> 20:01.798
It can't be!

20:01.800 --> 20:03.299
Okay, Tommy,
let's think about this,

20:03.301 --> 20:05.803
there's got to be some alternative
to leaving the country.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.775
What's that smell?

20:10.710 --> 20:12.075
Mrs. Crowley's probably cooking
some of her weird food.

20:12.077 --> 20:13.310
Weird?

20:13.312 --> 20:15.579
That's the sweet smell
of certified angus.

20:15.581 --> 20:17.382
Somebody open this door.

20:18.283 --> 20:19.550
If Sally were here, she can
give me a few pointers,

20:19.552 --> 20:21.518
maybe a trick or two?

20:21.520 --> 20:23.789
Well, we have a week, I'm
sure you can learn something.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.560
But she doesn't get back till
Thursday, that's way too late.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.196
What is that?

20:31.998 --> 20:33.065
It kind of smells like...

20:35.167 --> 20:36.835
<i>Steak!</i>

20:38.438 --> 20:39.706
<i>No!</i>

21:38.967 --> 21:41.569
Excellent job with
the marinade, Mrs. Crowley.

21:41.571 --> 21:43.172
Is that turmeric
I'm tasting?

21:44.007 --> 21:45.375
Tommy Schooner!

21:46.309 --> 21:49.545
If I could swim the English
Channel as a 70-year-old,

21:49.547 --> 21:52.215
I think I can make my way
out of your parents' pool!

22:00.958 --> 22:02.391
Hey, do you got a sec?

22:02.393 --> 22:04.862
Yeah, I'm just on hold
with Mr. Hoffman's office.

22:05.095 --> 22:06.995
Oh, yeah,
these are looking great.

22:06.997 --> 22:07.899
Yeah, what are your thoughts?

22:08.499 --> 22:10.199
Uh, I mean,
I think it's a good start.

22:10.201 --> 22:11.400
- I've got a few notes for the printer.
- Hmm.

22:11.402 --> 22:13.001
But I think
that would be pretty good.

22:13.003 --> 22:14.537
Yeah. No, I love it.
This one's great.

22:17.708 --> 22:19.344
Hello, Mrs. Crowley?

22:21.446 --> 22:22.714
He did what?

22:24.382 --> 22:26.383
I am so sorry,
we will be right home.

22:26.385 --> 22:28.284
- We gotta go.
- No, what about Mr. Hoffman?

22:28.286 --> 22:29.754
You're gonna have
to call him back.

22:32.157 --> 22:33.925
What did she say happened?

22:35.360 --> 22:36.628
<i>Hello, George.</i>

22:37.530 --> 22:38.596
George?

22:38.598 --> 22:40.331
Hello? George?

22:48.609 --> 22:51.811
And here's a little extra
for your dry cleaning.

22:52.645 --> 22:55.012
Again, Mrs. Crowley,
we are just so sorry.

22:55.014 --> 22:58.382
Not half as sorry as you're going
to be tomorrow, young lady.

22:58.384 --> 23:00.752
I'm putting you two
on the babysitter blacklist

23:00.754 --> 23:05.256
until you two teach that boy
and his mutt some manners!

23:05.258 --> 23:06.827
- Mrs. Crowley, if there's anything...
- Mmm!

23:07.528 --> 23:08.695
Blacklist.

23:17.004 --> 23:18.336
That can't be
a real thing, right?

23:18.338 --> 23:19.874
Uh, no.

23:20.341 --> 23:22.776
So, what was up
with that, Tommy?

23:23.678 --> 23:26.479
- Dad, I...
- You know what, I get it.

23:26.481 --> 23:28.448
You think you're too old
for a babysitter,

23:28.450 --> 23:30.484
so you pushed
an old woman in a pool?

23:30.486 --> 23:31.652
No, what happened was...

23:31.654 --> 23:33.386
Great way to demonstrate
your maturity.

23:33.388 --> 23:34.787
I mean, if that's supposed
to prove to us

23:34.789 --> 23:36.690
that you're responsible enough that
you don't need a babysitter...

23:36.692 --> 23:38.625
No, I was just trying to...

23:38.627 --> 23:41.596
Don't interrupt me, young man.
Just go straight up to your room.

23:42.197 --> 23:43.665
We'll call you down
for dinner.

23:48.604 --> 23:50.539
Don't you think you were
just a little harsh on him?

23:51.774 --> 23:53.507
Maybe.

23:53.509 --> 23:55.610
I wouldn't wanna spend all day
with Mrs. Crowley, either.

23:55.612 --> 23:56.913
Well, no one does.

23:59.615 --> 24:00.582
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:01.518 --> 24:03.519
See the board
Sheckler just released?

24:03.820 --> 24:04.888
Doesn't look that great.

24:05.421 --> 24:06.421
Oh.

24:09.359 --> 24:10.325
So...

24:14.698 --> 24:16.332
What are we gonna do
about Tommy?

24:17.367 --> 24:18.601
Oh, no luck with
the babysitter?

24:19.504 --> 24:22.472
No, everyone was booked.

24:23.206 --> 24:24.909
Well, we'll try
a couple in the morning.

24:25.376 --> 24:27.812
I mean, babysitter blacklist
can't be a real thing.

24:28.479 --> 24:30.748
Thanks, but I meant in
general, not just tomorrow.

24:32.216 --> 24:35.385
He's a pre-teen, I'm sure he's just
trying to figure out who he is.

24:37.556 --> 24:38.522
Who is he?

24:39.657 --> 24:40.825
What do you mean?

24:43.795 --> 24:45.429
You and Sally...

24:46.531 --> 24:48.967
have been best buds
since she was born.

24:50.636 --> 24:54.005
And I'm just a little worried
that Tommy feels left out.

24:54.473 --> 24:56.540
I mean, you know that is why

24:56.542 --> 24:58.742
he started taking up all this
skateboarding stuff recently.

24:58.744 --> 25:00.109
No, he always skated.

25:00.111 --> 25:01.379
No.

25:01.981 --> 25:04.783
We have always given him
skateboard stuff.

25:05.183 --> 25:07.687
It's only recently that
he started focusing on it.

25:09.722 --> 25:12.091
Okay, I'll talk to him
this week.

25:12.592 --> 25:15.094
Uh, next week,
after the pitch meeting.

25:16.663 --> 25:17.630
Okay.

25:19.332 --> 25:20.666
- Thank you.
- Sure.

25:22.302 --> 25:23.870
- Good night.
- Good night.

25:26.807 --> 25:28.707
Seriously, it's like, they
didn't make any improvements

25:28.709 --> 25:30.744
to the last model,
though, you know?

25:31.412 --> 25:34.147
Please, don't stay up all night
scouting the competition.

25:34.715 --> 25:35.883
I know how you get.

25:37.886 --> 25:40.520
Just... what are
they thinking?

25:41.455 --> 25:43.057
They didn't even change
the graphics.

25:43.558 --> 25:44.825
George.

25:47.361 --> 25:49.530
It's like they don't
wanna sell skateboards.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.599
- George.
- No, that's good for us.

25:52.601 --> 25:53.567
We'll sell more.

25:57.339 --> 25:59.271
No, it's fine,
we'll sell 'em, you know?

25:59.273 --> 26:00.406
- George!
- Okay, good night.

26:00.408 --> 26:01.576
Love you.

26:10.886 --> 26:12.053
Are you sure?

26:12.688 --> 26:14.156
Okay, thank you.

26:15.156 --> 26:17.691
No. No one can come. I think
the blacklist is a real thing.

26:17.693 --> 26:20.194
Oh, man, that just means I'm gonna
have to work from home today.

26:20.196 --> 26:21.662
Well, no,
that's not a good idea,

26:21.664 --> 26:23.564
the posters have to get out to the printer.
I'll stay home.

26:23.566 --> 26:25.135
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

26:25.535 --> 26:26.768
No, wait, you have a meeting.

26:26.770 --> 26:28.537
No, I think it's a call...

26:29.538 --> 26:31.606
No, you're right,
it's a meeting.

26:31.608 --> 26:33.043
I could come with you guys.

26:34.477 --> 26:36.311
Really?

26:36.313 --> 26:38.715
Yeah, it's cool. I could come
to work with you guys, and...

26:39.449 --> 26:41.783
I'm sorry about yesterday.

26:41.785 --> 26:43.753
Well, the office
isn't gonna be much fun.

26:43.755 --> 26:45.453
It's cool, I don't mind,

26:45.455 --> 26:48.457
and it is my fault that we
can't get a babysitter.

26:48.459 --> 26:50.094
I promise I won't
cause problems.

26:52.429 --> 26:54.097
- Can you be ready in 15?
- You bet.

26:56.901 --> 26:58.768
They hand down
our sentence?

26:58.770 --> 27:00.569
We're off to the big house,
aren't we?

27:00.571 --> 27:02.006
It's gonna be perfect.

27:03.042 --> 27:05.609
I'm gonna pick up a few pointers
at the skate company, and...

27:06.445 --> 27:09.814
Watch out, Frankie, I'm gonna get a
crash course at kicking your butt.

27:10.015 --> 27:11.615
Crash course?

27:12.451 --> 27:14.052
You might wanna rethink
your choice of words, Tommy.

27:21.694 --> 27:24.629
I just wanna thank you guys
for letting me tag along today.

27:24.931 --> 27:27.764
I've been thinking about taking
some business courses online,

27:27.766 --> 27:30.937
and I think it'll really help
getting some real world experience.

27:35.741 --> 27:38.009
You can hang out
in my office if you want.

27:38.011 --> 27:40.780
Tommy, my man! Haven't seen you
in a minute. How's it hanging?

27:41.346 --> 27:43.748
Yeah, pretty good, I just
started summer break, so...

27:43.750 --> 27:45.316
Nice.

27:45.318 --> 27:47.220
How I miss those
carefree summer days.

27:47.520 --> 27:50.421
I was looking at the Mark
III, by the way, sick trucks.

27:50.423 --> 27:51.789
- Thanks, buddy.
- Yeah.

27:51.791 --> 27:55.295
The Mark IV is gonna
blow your mind.

27:56.397 --> 27:58.132
You wanna come check out
our prototype?

27:58.733 --> 27:59.630
Go ahead.

27:59.632 --> 28:00.434
- Yeah, sure.
- Sweet.

28:02.470 --> 28:04.304
Welcome to the workshop.

28:07.441 --> 28:08.942
When it comes
to skateboarding,

28:08.944 --> 28:11.677
it's all about manipulating
the center of mass

28:11.679 --> 28:14.215
to increase the inertial
payout of the bearings.

28:15.349 --> 28:17.616
Of course, it helps if you can
get the coefficient of friction

28:17.618 --> 28:21.387
down to about
point-five, point-two.

28:21.389 --> 28:23.957
But by increasing
the drag ratio

28:23.959 --> 28:26.061
and decreasing the weight,

28:26.595 --> 28:28.995
I've hit a real
Lorentzian transformation

28:28.997 --> 28:31.065
between the rider
and the board,

28:31.067 --> 28:35.635
which obviously is gonna give you
some ridiculous speed yields

28:35.637 --> 28:37.738
when you run it
outside of the simulations.

28:37.740 --> 28:41.775
I was hoping for a business practical,
not a lesson in space-time.

28:41.777 --> 28:45.079
Uh, Jerome, all this
is pretty fascinating.

28:45.081 --> 28:46.782
Right?

28:47.617 --> 28:51.654
Yeah, totes, but how can I
relate this to, say, a trick?

28:53.623 --> 28:57.327
Dude, like every
single way possible.

28:57.828 --> 28:59.329
All right, check it.

29:00.130 --> 29:01.932
Let's say you're booking along
at some velocity...

29:02.399 --> 29:04.633
V, right?

29:04.635 --> 29:08.605
And you wanna maximize your airtime
and your delta T, over here, right?

29:09.072 --> 29:11.973
It's all about this integral
over the cosine of the vector,

29:11.975 --> 29:15.146
which spits out your
Y component, and...

29:17.014 --> 29:21.684
ultimately, the amount of force you
gotta spit out on this distance, X,

29:21.686 --> 29:23.221
in relation to
your fulcrum point.

29:24.689 --> 29:26.889
I think he's saying
you gotta push down hard

29:26.891 --> 29:29.391
on the back of the board
to make it go high,

29:29.393 --> 29:30.894
but I might've missed a step.

29:30.896 --> 29:32.628
Uh, let me start over.

29:32.630 --> 29:35.765
Uh, Jerome,
I just remembered,

29:35.767 --> 29:39.737
I gotta help my mom out
with... something.

29:40.438 --> 29:42.573
All good, little man.

29:42.575 --> 29:44.810
Anytime you wanna unlock the secrets
to the skateboard universe,

29:45.044 --> 29:46.145
stop on by.

29:46.912 --> 29:48.045
All right, thanks.

29:48.047 --> 29:49.215
Come on, Buddy.

29:53.085 --> 29:54.386
That was fast.

29:54.621 --> 29:55.787
Ugh.

29:56.122 --> 29:57.888
Way over my head.

29:57.890 --> 29:59.756
Yeah, most
people are with him.

29:59.758 --> 30:02.594
I think I noticed a
miscalculation on his notes.

30:02.596 --> 30:05.196
But my trigonometry
is a little rusty.

30:05.198 --> 30:07.066
Are these for
the pitch meeting on Friday?

30:07.434 --> 30:09.836
Yep, gotta impress
Mr. Hoffman.

30:11.037 --> 30:14.006
He represents one of the largest
investment firms in Los Angeles,

30:14.008 --> 30:17.141
so if they see
something they like,

30:17.143 --> 30:19.812
it could take Modern Skate
to the global market,

30:20.214 --> 30:23.748
and maybe it would get
your dad enough funding

30:23.750 --> 30:25.786
to get that skate park built
that he's always wanted.

30:26.187 --> 30:27.421
That's exciting.

30:27.889 --> 30:29.021
Mmm-hmm.

30:29.023 --> 30:30.691
Can we get a bigger pool?

30:31.492 --> 30:33.694
Ha-ha. What? So you can push
another babysitter in?

30:35.463 --> 30:37.630
I'm never going to be able
to live that down, am I?

30:37.632 --> 30:38.799
Nope.

30:39.967 --> 30:40.935
Huh.

30:41.969 --> 30:43.136
What? What's wrong?

30:43.138 --> 30:44.105
Ah...

30:44.505 --> 30:46.505
I just can't put
my finger on it.

30:46.507 --> 30:49.009
I just feel like something is
missing from this campaign.

30:49.011 --> 30:51.246
Nah, Sally's great.

30:51.647 --> 30:52.914
She's gonna
knock their socks off.

30:55.517 --> 30:57.517
What, what's so funny?

30:57.519 --> 30:59.888
Oh, that's just a phrase your
father used the other night.

31:02.591 --> 31:04.859
How did Sally get so good
at skateboarding?

31:08.164 --> 31:12.033
Oh, geez, I mean, she started
with your dad when she was four.

31:12.769 --> 31:14.502
Did you ever go out with her?

31:14.504 --> 31:17.271
Who me?
No. I never learned.

31:17.273 --> 31:19.607
Um, your father tried to teach
me when we were dating

31:19.609 --> 31:21.077
and I thought I was
gonna break my neck.

31:23.846 --> 31:25.816
Dad skated when he was a kid?

31:27.184 --> 31:29.453
What, are you kidding?

31:30.754 --> 31:32.921
I mean, your father
lived for skateboarding,

31:32.923 --> 31:34.524
that's why he started
this company.

31:35.893 --> 31:37.859
I guess I never
thought of him

31:37.861 --> 31:40.364
being involved in any other
way than the business.

31:42.867 --> 31:46.002
Well, maybe you
should go talk to him.

31:46.004 --> 31:48.038
You know, I'm sure he would
love to share that with you.

31:48.540 --> 31:50.208
Yeah, maybe.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.844
Do you mind if I go
mess around on the half pipe?

31:55.281 --> 31:57.949
Be my guest, I have to finish
proofing these, anyway.

32:17.169 --> 32:19.137
Is this leftover quinoa?

32:19.139 --> 32:22.542
Mmm-hmm. Yeah,
you said you liked it.

32:22.942 --> 32:25.545
I did say that,
I love it, thank you.

32:27.280 --> 32:28.881
Does Tommy want some?

32:29.615 --> 32:31.284
Oh, no, he already ate.

32:31.685 --> 32:33.118
I made him a sandwich earlier.

32:33.120 --> 32:34.853
Mmm. Sandwich.

32:36.623 --> 32:38.190
Hey, how'd the meeting
go this morning?

32:38.192 --> 32:40.725
Good, good, the factory said
they can triple the units

32:40.727 --> 32:41.626
as soon as we
give them the word.

32:41.628 --> 32:42.596
That's great.

32:43.297 --> 32:45.165
Did Tommy come
and talk to you earlier today?

32:45.732 --> 32:46.933
No, what's up?

32:48.169 --> 32:50.369
He just asked me how Sally
got so good at skateboarding,

32:50.371 --> 32:51.905
so I told him
to come talk to you.

32:52.106 --> 32:54.842
Really? Yeah,
tell him that's fine.

32:55.143 --> 32:58.010
Well, if he does, will you please
just make some time for him?

32:58.012 --> 32:59.180
Of course.

33:28.143 --> 33:31.813
Hi, yeah, the pepperoni pizza I
ordered for the Modern Skate offices,

33:31.815 --> 33:34.315
yeah, I just wanted to remind
you to, when you get here,

33:34.317 --> 33:36.386
call my cell phone,
not the main line.

33:36.886 --> 33:38.186
Okay.

33:38.188 --> 33:39.956
Oh, yeah, just five minutes?
Great, thank you.

33:40.957 --> 33:42.091
Hey, Tommy, what's up?

33:42.560 --> 33:44.259
Sorry to bother you
on the phone.

33:44.261 --> 33:46.362
No worries,
nothing important.

33:47.097 --> 33:48.665
How's everything going
for the campaign?

33:48.933 --> 33:50.099
Great, really great.

33:50.101 --> 33:52.068
Gonna launch us
into the stratosphere.

33:53.703 --> 33:57.239
I was looking at the Mark IV with
Jerome, it looks really cool.

33:57.241 --> 33:59.209
Yeah, he's doing some
next level stuff over there.

34:00.078 --> 34:03.112
I cannot wait to try it out
when it's available.

34:03.114 --> 34:04.481
Really?

34:05.282 --> 34:08.284
Yeah? Uh... I mean, I'm sure
he can lend you a board,

34:08.286 --> 34:10.286
a prototype,
if you're interested.

34:10.721 --> 34:14.324
Well, you know,
I'm okay with my board.

34:14.326 --> 34:16.092
Old reliable, you know?

34:16.793 --> 34:17.995
Let me see it.

34:18.730 --> 34:21.364
All right, here you go.

34:21.366 --> 34:22.667
Yeah, it's a good board.

34:23.201 --> 34:25.069
Solid construction...

34:26.004 --> 34:28.338
Wait, is this
Sally's old Mark II?

34:28.340 --> 34:30.007
It sure is, yeah.

34:30.810 --> 34:32.143
Yeah, this is a good board.

34:32.710 --> 34:34.380
Think she did
her first 50-50 on it.

34:34.980 --> 34:38.350
Man, would I love to unlock
some of that magic.

34:38.885 --> 34:42.389
Well, you know, it's not about the
board, it's all in the shoes.

34:42.822 --> 34:44.089
Oh, really?

34:44.891 --> 34:47.092
No, no,
I'm just kidding.

34:47.426 --> 34:49.726
It's all in the rider, I mean,
you just gotta put the time in.

34:49.728 --> 34:50.963
You wanna practice a little?

34:51.498 --> 34:53.299
- That'd be awesome!
- Tonight?

34:54.434 --> 34:57.269
Oh, man, really?
You sure you aren't too busy?

34:57.271 --> 34:58.869
I'm never too busy
for you, buddy.

34:58.871 --> 35:00.373
Yeah, we'll hit the skate
park by the house.

35:00.375 --> 35:02.475
Thanks, Dad.

35:02.477 --> 35:04.242
Sure. Yeah, I've got a few more
hours of work here to finish up,

35:04.244 --> 35:05.143
and then we'll go.

35:05.145 --> 35:06.379
Nice.

35:06.381 --> 35:07.582
This came for you.

35:08.015 --> 35:09.247
Uh, me? I didn't...

35:09.249 --> 35:11.249
I didn't order a pizza.

35:11.251 --> 35:13.319
Oh, that's funny because
it's got your name on it.

35:13.321 --> 35:15.388
Well, I gotta go.

35:15.390 --> 35:16.591
Thanks again, Dad.

35:17.258 --> 35:19.759
I'm taking him to
the skate park tonight.

35:19.761 --> 35:22.230
Oh, good, I'm glad you're
doing one thing I ask of you.

35:22.829 --> 35:25.199
I love you,
and your quinoa-meanwa.

35:27.503 --> 35:29.003
But it's not pizza.

35:31.073 --> 35:32.307
Oh, there you are.

35:42.452 --> 35:45.252
I'm just glad
all this stuff still fits.

35:45.254 --> 35:47.556
It's been a while.
All right, here goes nothing.

36:25.430 --> 36:27.531
That was pretty good.

36:28.399 --> 36:30.567
Well, thanks, I don't know
how I missed that one,

36:30.569 --> 36:32.069
I used to do those
in my sleep.

36:33.137 --> 36:35.472
I'd score it an 8.6.

36:36.408 --> 36:38.343
Okay, your turn, Tommy.

37:03.636 --> 37:06.238
I'd give it a... 2.1.

37:07.240 --> 37:08.341
Okay, pretty good.

37:09.142 --> 37:11.442
I didn't fall,
that's an improvement.

37:11.444 --> 37:14.180
He's self-taught. I'm changing
my score to a five-even.

37:15.181 --> 37:17.383
It's fine,
these things take time.

37:18.652 --> 37:21.187
Say I didn't have time.

37:21.555 --> 37:22.889
What do you mean?

37:23.490 --> 37:25.125
Say I didn't have until...

37:25.359 --> 37:27.492
I don't know... Friday?

37:27.494 --> 37:29.228
What happens Friday?

37:30.265 --> 37:32.364
Nothing, nothing
is happening on Friday.

37:32.366 --> 37:33.667
Nothing good.

37:34.635 --> 37:38.906
But say, hypothetically, I had
to learn a trick by Friday,

37:39.641 --> 37:40.808
where would you start?

37:42.210 --> 37:43.478
Okay. Uh...

37:43.678 --> 37:44.879
How's your ollie?

37:45.613 --> 37:50.385
Let's say, hypothetically,
that I can't do one.

37:51.152 --> 37:55.658
Okay, we have
our work cut out for us.

37:56.492 --> 37:57.826
Let's head down here.

37:58.828 --> 38:00.994
Okay, so when you're ready to jump,
you're gonna bend your knees,

38:00.996 --> 38:03.564
push down on the back,
and then when you jump,

38:03.566 --> 38:06.233
that's when you slide your front
foot forward, like that, okay?

38:06.235 --> 38:07.935
And it should make that sound
as you do it...

38:09.205 --> 38:10.471
...just tearing up your shoes,

38:10.473 --> 38:12.742
so we have to buy new shoes
all the time, okay?

38:13.042 --> 38:16.577
When you do that, that's what makes the
board kind of come up and level out.

38:16.579 --> 38:17.746
All right?

38:18.081 --> 38:19.214
Simple, right?

38:19.216 --> 38:20.050
Yep.

38:20.717 --> 38:22.450
I got four knees to bend.

38:22.452 --> 38:23.887
I'll sit this lesson out.

38:25.989 --> 38:27.023
All right, you got this.

38:28.291 --> 38:30.058
- Okay, so I bend the knees...
- Yes.

38:30.060 --> 38:31.292
- Back...
- Yep.

38:31.294 --> 38:33.094
- Slide up...
- Yep.

38:33.096 --> 38:35.398
When you're jumping, you tear up
your shoes, just like I taught you.

38:36.167 --> 38:37.935
Okay. Did Sally
learn this way?

38:38.335 --> 38:40.636
Oh, yeah, I mean, I think
we were skating together

38:40.638 --> 38:42.671
since she was like,
four, I think.

38:42.673 --> 38:44.207
She was a quick learner?

38:45.041 --> 38:48.645
She was, uh, she took to a
board like a duck to water.

38:48.647 --> 38:51.682
And, you know, I was skating more
then, too, I had more time...

38:52.550 --> 38:55.351
I don't know, I think by the
time you were old enough,

38:55.353 --> 38:58.053
she was so advanced, and I was
busy with the company and...

38:58.055 --> 39:00.224
It's cool, this is fun now.

39:00.659 --> 39:02.492
- Yeah, right?
- Oh, yeah.

39:02.494 --> 39:03.993
You know what, let's...
Wanna try another one?

39:03.995 --> 39:05.730
I'll be your human safety net.

39:05.732 --> 39:07.432
All right, whoa. Got it.

39:08.767 --> 39:10.267
- All right, ready?
- Yep.

39:10.869 --> 39:13.873
Bend your knees,
and three, two, one, pop!

39:15.274 --> 39:17.474
- All right!
- I didn't fall!

39:17.476 --> 39:19.477
No, but you got
the baby ollie.

39:19.479 --> 39:21.813
- All right, let's go for a toddler ollie.
- Okay.

39:22.715 --> 39:24.617
Three, two, one, pop!

39:25.618 --> 39:29.085
Okay, might've been another baby,
but three years old maybe,

39:29.087 --> 39:30.388
I don't know
what toddlers are.

39:30.390 --> 39:32.390
- Okay, we're good though.
- I didn't fall, so...

39:32.392 --> 39:35.260
We're making progress,
we're both still alive.

40:11.398 --> 40:13.500
Thanks for coaching
me today, Dad.

40:13.502 --> 40:15.568
No problem.

40:15.570 --> 40:18.204
I don't know if you'll be ready for
anything on Friday, hypothetically,

40:18.206 --> 40:20.842
but you're definitely better now
than you were even a few hours ago.

40:21.343 --> 40:22.742
Hey, Tommy. Hey, Mr. Schooner.

40:22.744 --> 40:24.847
- Hey, Alice, nice to see you.
- You, too.

40:25.080 --> 40:26.714
You guys skate around a bit?

40:26.716 --> 40:28.483
Yeah, he was just teaching
me a few moves for...

40:29.652 --> 40:31.320
you know, Friday.

40:34.089 --> 40:35.355
- Oh. Okay, okay!
- Yeah.

40:35.357 --> 40:36.927
Oh. Oh, cool.

40:37.794 --> 40:39.193
Yeah, actually turns out he's
got some pretty sweet moves.

40:39.195 --> 40:43.066
Okay, all right, I'm gonna go home,
it's my night to cook dinner.

40:43.299 --> 40:44.500
Uh, you'll be there soon?

40:45.101 --> 40:46.200
Yeah.

40:46.202 --> 40:47.703
Okay, Alice,
you guys have fun.

40:49.673 --> 40:50.907
So...

40:53.109 --> 40:54.245
still up
for that skate-off?

40:54.846 --> 40:57.714
Gotta. I mean,
my reputation's on the line.

40:58.148 --> 41:00.181
Plus, my dad taught me
a bunch today,

41:00.183 --> 41:02.619
and with Sally's help on Thursday, I
think I'll be able to hold my own.

41:03.186 --> 41:04.354
If you say so.

41:04.555 --> 41:05.855
You wanna practice some more?

41:05.857 --> 41:07.690
No. You brought
the camera, right?

41:07.692 --> 41:09.794
- Oh, yeah. Okay.
- Let's shoot around a little.

41:17.435 --> 41:18.603
Alice, is the camera rolling?

41:20.772 --> 41:21.939
Rolling.

41:22.140 --> 41:23.608
All right.

41:24.677 --> 41:27.912
Okay, I just need better than an
8.6 and I take home the gold.

41:33.151 --> 41:34.250
Hey, Scooter.

41:34.252 --> 41:35.853
Hey, Frankie.

41:35.855 --> 41:37.789
Your dog skates, too?

41:38.958 --> 41:41.693
Man, is there anyone in your family
who can't skate, other than you?

41:42.161 --> 41:44.194
Nice one, Frankie.

41:44.196 --> 41:47.466
Listen, why don't we do this
right now, and get it over with?

41:48.335 --> 41:49.601
Really?

41:49.603 --> 41:50.737
Psych!

41:51.303 --> 41:52.804
No way I'm letting you off
that easy.

41:52.806 --> 41:56.874
I'm gonna make you look silly in
front of the biggest crowd possible.

41:56.876 --> 41:59.578
Hey, Frankie, you mind
getting out of my shot?

41:59.580 --> 42:01.148
Your big head's
getting in the way.

42:01.581 --> 42:03.815
I'm done wasting my time
with you nerds, anyway.

42:03.817 --> 42:04.951
Laters.

42:06.854 --> 42:08.655
Thanks, Alice.
Camera still rolling?

42:09.589 --> 42:11.222
Rolling.

42:11.224 --> 42:13.827
All right, ready,
and three, two, action!

42:14.862 --> 42:16.596
Coming in
for my close-up.

42:21.502 --> 42:24.705
9.1.
Buddy takes home the gold!

42:26.407 --> 42:27.473
Buddy!

42:27.475 --> 42:28.574
Buddy!

42:28.576 --> 42:29.510
Buddy!

42:29.811 --> 42:31.813
Good job, Buddy!

42:38.787 --> 42:40.687
Come on, Frankie!

42:40.689 --> 42:42.992
Sally's never gonna respect
moves like that.

42:56.271 --> 42:58.839
You're a pro, yes, you are.

42:58.841 --> 43:01.575
Good job, Buddy, good job.

43:01.577 --> 43:03.145
Okay, let's go,
let's go back, boy.

43:11.588 --> 43:13.589
Thanks again for dinner,
Mr. and Mrs. S.

43:17.761 --> 43:21.264
I gave you pure gold
to work with, as usual.

43:33.011 --> 43:35.712
Nice job, good job, Buddy.

43:35.714 --> 43:36.814
You're welcome.

43:50.628 --> 43:53.598
Wait a minute, replay that.

43:58.703 --> 44:00.105
<i>Come on, Frankie.</i>

44:01.006 --> 44:02.574
<i>Sally's never gonna respect
moves like that.</i>

44:05.044 --> 44:06.779
- Oh!
- Did he just say "Sally"?

44:07.513 --> 44:09.413
Looks like someone's
got a little crush.

44:09.415 --> 44:10.781
Ugh!

44:10.783 --> 44:13.119
Gross, no way.

44:13.519 --> 44:14.553
This is too good.

44:15.454 --> 44:17.290
We can't use this, right?

44:18.492 --> 44:20.892
Not unless you wanna make him the
laughing stock of the entire school.

44:20.894 --> 44:22.661
So tempting.

44:24.431 --> 44:25.598
Wait.

44:31.973 --> 44:33.673
<i>Come on, Frankie.</i>

44:34.341 --> 44:35.875
You guys mind keeping it down?

44:35.877 --> 44:37.677
I had a tough day riding.

44:42.884 --> 44:44.652
Same thing we did
at the park, yep.

44:44.852 --> 44:46.253
Great.

44:52.760 --> 44:53.693
Modern Skate.

44:53.695 --> 44:54.896
All right, ready?

45:19.989 --> 45:21.157
Yes!

46:11.009 --> 46:13.312
So, what do you think?

46:14.213 --> 46:17.581
Whoa. Mom, these look awesome.

46:17.583 --> 46:21.153
Aw. Thanks. I think the printer
did a pretty good job.

46:21.453 --> 46:22.719
You've got
a great eye, though.

46:22.721 --> 46:24.790
The image, like, really pops.

46:25.024 --> 46:26.859
Aw. That's so sweet.

46:28.560 --> 46:31.331
So, how is skateboard
training coming along?

46:31.697 --> 46:33.697
Okay, yeah,
Dad's a good teacher.

46:33.699 --> 46:36.467
And you were right, he's a pretty
baller skateboarder still.

46:36.469 --> 46:38.405
I don't doubt that.

46:39.839 --> 46:43.742
So, why the sudden interest
in skateboarding?

46:45.812 --> 46:49.282
Oh, no reason, I just really...

46:50.017 --> 46:51.418
What in the world?

46:53.620 --> 46:54.721
Welcome home, Sal.

46:58.492 --> 47:01.060
Oh! So good to see you!

47:01.062 --> 47:02.228
Oh, good, you came.

47:02.230 --> 47:04.230
I was trying to tell you,
Sally's here!

47:04.232 --> 47:06.899
- You got in early.
- Yeah, about an hour or so.

47:06.901 --> 47:09.237
- Luckily, the driver was already there.
- Oh, good.

47:09.837 --> 47:11.203
Hey, monkey, good to see you.

47:11.205 --> 47:12.374
Hey.

47:22.184 --> 47:23.884
Welcome back.

47:23.886 --> 47:27.287
Okay, well, gang, in honor
of my lovely daughter,

47:27.289 --> 47:30.958
and the face of our company,
returning home from her... 13?

47:30.960 --> 47:31.959
Fifteen.

47:31.961 --> 47:33.996
Fifteen-country tour,

47:34.529 --> 47:36.999
what do you say we take the
rest of the afternoon off?

47:37.900 --> 47:38.867
Yeah!

47:39.969 --> 47:41.336
Billy, wanna get us
some pizzas?

47:41.805 --> 47:43.172
Okay. Put it on
the company card.

47:47.042 --> 47:50.812
So, which was your
favorite country?

47:51.081 --> 47:54.615
- Uh, either Italy or England.
- Nice.

47:54.617 --> 47:57.852
Italy was just gorgeous, and we
didn't have great weather in England,

47:57.854 --> 47:59.722
but London was super cool.

47:59.724 --> 48:00.856
Nice.

48:00.858 --> 48:02.157
How was the end
of the school year?

48:02.159 --> 48:03.725
Uh, it was okay.

48:03.727 --> 48:06.130
One B, the rest were As.

48:06.564 --> 48:08.265
Mark Jacobson
got his bike stolen.

48:09.300 --> 48:12.302
And then someone let a frog loose
in the girls' locker room, so...

48:12.304 --> 48:14.269
Was it you?

48:14.271 --> 48:17.072
No, I did convince
one of the teachers

48:17.074 --> 48:21.278
to play a movie for three straight
classes for "cultural purposes."

48:22.279 --> 48:25.483
So Dad told me yesterday that
you guys were skateboarding?

48:25.716 --> 48:28.919
Yeah, he was just teaching me
a few moves.

48:29.322 --> 48:30.322
What brought that on?

48:31.023 --> 48:33.655
Well, I've been trying
a little, since you left.

48:33.657 --> 48:36.562
You could tell, he was bummed
when you were gone, so...

48:36.762 --> 48:39.295
Aw. That's really
sweet of you.

48:39.297 --> 48:41.166
Shut up.

48:41.666 --> 48:45.403
Ugh. And then I went and did
something pretty stupid.

48:45.837 --> 48:47.005
Uh-oh.

48:47.874 --> 48:51.275
So I was mad at Dad 'cause he
made me have a babysitter,

48:51.277 --> 48:53.077
and for some other things,

48:53.079 --> 48:56.115
and then I ran into Frankie,

48:56.315 --> 49:01.253
like, literally, ran into
Frankie, on the street.

49:01.255 --> 49:03.087
- Frankie from the skate park?
- Yes.

49:03.089 --> 49:04.924
Always hung around
with Stewart and Worm?

49:05.225 --> 49:07.394
Yeah, that Frankie.

49:07.928 --> 49:11.297
And he said some things, that
like, normally doesn't bug me,

49:11.299 --> 49:13.467
but I just let it get to me,

49:13.901 --> 49:18.138
and I challenged him
to a skate-off...

49:19.207 --> 49:20.374
tomorrow.

49:21.175 --> 49:22.342
Oh, monkey.

49:23.178 --> 49:25.244
You were always good at getting
yourself into trouble.

49:25.246 --> 49:27.979
And you were always good at
getting me out of trouble, so...

49:27.981 --> 49:29.816
There you are, I want you
to meet the sales team,

49:29.818 --> 49:31.150
they're gonna be a big part
of the meeting tomorrow.

49:31.152 --> 49:32.353
Talk later.

49:35.824 --> 49:39.594
Hey, buddy, it's okay, your dad's
just really excited for this meeting.

49:39.828 --> 49:41.963
It's fine, I get it.

49:46.801 --> 49:50.003
Mike, here's the one who decided to
use the softer metal on the trucks.

49:50.005 --> 49:51.838
Too much
excitement today.

49:51.840 --> 49:53.173
I think I overdid it.

49:53.175 --> 49:55.010
But it hasn't been
a problem, right?

49:56.078 --> 49:58.112
Well, she's been
on cement parks,

49:58.114 --> 50:00.215
pre-fab, kind of
traditional parks as well,

50:00.217 --> 50:01.950
and no real issues.

50:05.455 --> 50:07.457
...designs and color wise,
I mean...

50:08.924 --> 50:10.292
She's all about
purples...

50:12.696 --> 50:13.795
What is it, Tommy?

50:13.797 --> 50:15.130
I think Mr. Hoffman is here.

50:15.132 --> 50:16.098
What?

50:19.202 --> 50:20.370
Okay.

50:22.439 --> 50:23.707
Uh, Mr. Hoffman...

50:24.908 --> 50:26.741
My goodness...

50:26.743 --> 50:29.145
George, it's a pleasure
to finally meet you in person.

50:29.147 --> 50:31.380
Good to finally meet you, too,
Mr. Hoffman.

50:31.382 --> 50:33.449
You're here early.

50:33.451 --> 50:35.317
Yeah, I tried to tell you that
the other day on the phone,

50:35.319 --> 50:37.486
but we got disconnected.

50:37.488 --> 50:40.022
Anyway, I thought I'd come by and introduce
myself before our meeting tomorrow.

50:40.024 --> 50:42.024
I hope that didn't cause
any inconvenience.

50:42.026 --> 50:43.759
No, not at all.

50:43.761 --> 50:44.994
We're just taking
a little break

50:44.996 --> 50:46.963
because my daughter
came in early as well.

50:48.100 --> 50:50.233
Hi, Mr. Hoffman, I'm Sally Schooner.
I've heard so much about you.

50:50.235 --> 50:52.402
That's good.

50:52.404 --> 50:54.971
She actually just got back from a
world tour, she's been skating...

50:54.973 --> 50:59.142
Oh, yes, I am very well aware of Sally
and her skateboarding accomplishments.

50:59.144 --> 51:00.512
Ah.

51:00.946 --> 51:03.280
Well, great, I'm sure you'll
learn even more tomorrow

51:03.282 --> 51:04.881
when you see
the great ad campaign

51:04.883 --> 51:07.218
that our marketing team
has been working on.

51:07.220 --> 51:10.353
Mr. Hoffman, Mary Schooner, head
of marketing here at Modern Skate.

51:10.355 --> 51:12.924
And yet another Schooner,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

51:12.926 --> 51:15.126
You truly have
a family company here.

51:15.328 --> 51:17.195
Yes, very much so.

51:17.197 --> 51:18.963
And please come in,
we got pizza coming.

51:18.965 --> 51:20.700
Oh, no, thank you.

51:21.833 --> 51:23.302
I appreciate that, but we're gonna go.
We do look forward to seeing

51:23.304 --> 51:25.970
what you're going to be presenting
us in the morning. Good evening.

51:25.972 --> 51:27.004
Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.

51:27.006 --> 51:27.905
Schooner family.

51:27.907 --> 51:29.075
Thank you.

51:35.014 --> 51:37.282
Did that feel like...

51:37.284 --> 51:39.151
Tomorrow's gonna be
a total disaster?

51:40.221 --> 51:43.055
He seemed much more pleasant
on the phone.

51:43.057 --> 51:44.022
Yeah.

51:44.024 --> 51:45.791
Who wants pizza?

51:45.793 --> 51:48.061
Ooh! I'll have a slice.

51:48.063 --> 51:49.029
I'm sorry.

52:06.915 --> 52:08.549
So let me get this straight.

52:08.551 --> 52:10.316
You challenged Frankie,

52:10.318 --> 52:12.488
who's probably been skateboarding
since he was seven,

52:12.821 --> 52:14.690
to a skate-off tomorrow,

52:15.123 --> 52:18.193
and you've kind of been skating,
for what, three months?

52:18.828 --> 52:21.530
I'd say like 80/20, like...

52:22.231 --> 52:24.599
skating to goofing off.

52:24.601 --> 52:29.203
But I envision myself pulling, like, this
sweet move that nobody's seen before.

52:29.473 --> 52:30.871
That's helpful, right?

52:30.873 --> 52:32.306
What's the trick?

52:32.308 --> 52:34.508
I don't know, I'm not an
expert at this stuff.

52:34.510 --> 52:36.112
You're ridiculous.

52:36.413 --> 52:38.480
Is Vancouver
out of the question?

52:38.482 --> 52:39.649
What?

52:39.949 --> 52:41.718
It's a little town in Canada.

52:42.119 --> 52:43.420
They make
a lot of movies there.

52:44.354 --> 52:46.321
Some say it looks like New
York, but I can always tell.

52:46.323 --> 52:47.692
Never mind.

52:48.559 --> 52:52.060
I've just been working
really hard this past week,

52:52.062 --> 52:55.265
and wondering if you could give me
a few, like, last minute pointers?

52:56.334 --> 52:59.235
Tommy, it takes more than a
week to get good at anything,

52:59.237 --> 53:00.738
let alone skateboarding.

53:18.657 --> 53:21.258
I don't think my scale
goes high enough for that.

53:21.260 --> 53:23.362
Maybe a 12?
Fifteen?

53:25.631 --> 53:28.900
You think I could learn how to do any
part of what I just did in a week?

53:29.502 --> 53:32.469
That sequence alone took months
of practice for each part,

53:32.471 --> 53:35.375
based on years of effort to
master the most basic skills.

53:36.009 --> 53:37.275
So I'm doomed.

53:37.577 --> 53:39.644
Vancouver it is.

53:39.646 --> 53:40.746
I'll pack a bag...

53:41.014 --> 53:43.114
Of what, I don't quite know.

53:43.116 --> 53:44.948
I didn't say that.

53:44.950 --> 53:47.318
I just think you need to set
realistic goals for yourself,

53:47.320 --> 53:49.288
and appreciate how much
work goes into things.

53:53.260 --> 53:57.095
You think I could get as good as you
are with one of these in just a week?

53:57.097 --> 53:59.598
I've seen you and Alice running
around with the camera every day

53:59.600 --> 54:01.835
since Dad got his for
Christmas three years ago.

54:02.236 --> 54:05.239
Not to mention all the time you
spend watching movies in your room.

54:05.640 --> 54:09.341
I've seen like ten movies in my
life, and they're all rom-coms.

54:09.343 --> 54:10.576
Not true.

54:10.578 --> 54:12.446
I made you watch
<i>Cowboys vs Dinosaurs.</i>

54:12.714 --> 54:14.248
Classic.

54:15.616 --> 54:17.250
And it was very good.

54:17.252 --> 54:19.621
All I'm saying is,
these things take time.

54:20.655 --> 54:22.589
But I don't have time.

54:22.591 --> 54:25.558
I'm gonna embarrass myself if I
don't do something tomorrow.

54:25.560 --> 54:27.261
Well, let's see
what you've got.

54:48.050 --> 54:50.586
I hear Vancouver is lovely
this time of year.

54:51.154 --> 54:52.621
Seventy-eight
and sunny yesterday.

54:55.458 --> 54:57.658
You're like the best skater
in the world,

54:57.660 --> 55:00.464
isn't there a piece of magical
advice you can give me?

55:01.130 --> 55:03.330
All I can suggest is,
do your best.

55:03.332 --> 55:05.569
Whatever you're best at,
do it the best you can.

55:05.770 --> 55:07.602
Whatever you're worst at,

55:07.604 --> 55:09.238
do that to the best of
your abilities, as well.

55:10.206 --> 55:12.242
Eight grade is gonna be rough.

55:13.377 --> 55:16.244
Hopefully, everyone has a great summer
and they'll forget about tomorrow.

55:16.246 --> 55:18.180
I'm sure some
dance craze viral video

55:18.182 --> 55:20.784
will bump you down to the
number three spot this summer.

55:21.218 --> 55:22.252
Let's get home.

55:44.042 --> 55:46.542
You've definitely got the riding
straight and stopping thing down.

55:46.544 --> 55:48.779
Thanks, but even
Buddy can do that.

55:48.781 --> 55:50.716
What exactly
is that supposed to mean?

55:52.518 --> 55:56.587
Please don't tell Mom and Dad
about this stupid bet,

55:56.589 --> 55:59.491
I don't want them to know how
much of an idiot I was about it.

55:59.493 --> 56:01.693
All good, mum's the word.

56:01.695 --> 56:04.696
Besides, I think they're still a little
stressed over the meeting tomorrow.

56:21.147 --> 56:23.282
It's fine, right? I mean,
tell me it's gonna be fine,

56:23.284 --> 56:26.150
because maybe they were just tired
from traveling all day, right?

56:26.152 --> 56:28.754
I mean, I hope so, because they
basically walked into a pizza party.

56:28.756 --> 56:30.589
I mean, they think they're
coming to a place of business,

56:30.591 --> 56:33.325
and there we all are,
4:00 p.m. on a Thursday,

56:33.327 --> 56:36.395
just relaxing, about to
chow down on some pizza,

56:36.397 --> 56:39.231
and then, I ask them
if they wanna stay?

56:39.233 --> 56:41.401
I mean, we don't even know if
they like pizza, they're from LA!

56:41.403 --> 56:44.336
Yes, George, I'm sure they like
pizza, everyone likes pizza.

56:44.338 --> 56:46.539
Okay, that's true, good point,
everyone likes pizza.

56:46.541 --> 56:49.543
So, yeah, they're probably just tired,
it's what, a seven-hour flight from LA?

56:49.545 --> 56:50.879
Hon, will you relax?

56:51.480 --> 56:52.446
Take a seat.

56:56.518 --> 56:59.352
I have been going over all the
boards for the presentation,

56:59.354 --> 57:01.890
and you know
this material cold.

57:03.325 --> 57:07.862
And if they pass, then I'm perfectly
content with the pool size we have.

57:07.864 --> 57:10.465
I'm sorry. Sally, what was
your read on Mr. Hoffman?

57:10.801 --> 57:12.433
I thought he was nice.

57:12.435 --> 57:14.468
Quiet but
he was probably tired.

57:14.470 --> 57:16.336
Tired. Yeah, right, see?

57:16.338 --> 57:18.272
I'm just overreacting.

57:18.274 --> 57:20.241
Oh, here's an idea, have you guys
ever thought about trying to...

57:20.243 --> 57:21.375
Mary, can I take
a look at your tablet?

57:21.377 --> 57:22.878
I wanna review
the earnings reports.

57:22.880 --> 57:25.146
Maybe if we can't wow them
with the campaign,

57:25.148 --> 57:26.415
we can do it with the numbers.

57:27.784 --> 57:30.419
Tommy, I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

57:30.421 --> 57:32.923
It's fine, it doesn't matter.

57:33.222 --> 57:35.126
Hey, Tommy. Just do your best.

57:35.659 --> 57:38.493
Thanks, and thanks for going
to the skate park with me.

57:38.495 --> 57:39.663
Ah-ha!

57:40.129 --> 57:40.964
There's a mistake
in the numbers.

57:40.966 --> 57:42.934
Ah, there's a mistake
in the numbers.

57:43.835 --> 57:45.634
I told Steve to double check
all these reports, and...

57:45.636 --> 57:49.237
Oh, no, no, no.
These reports are perfect.

57:49.239 --> 57:51.909
Is everything gonna be all right?
Dad's really stressing.

57:53.211 --> 57:55.945
This pitch meeting
is really important,

57:55.947 --> 57:58.716
and Dad just found out

57:58.718 --> 58:01.452
that Sheckler Boards just signed a
huge deal with a Chinese company.

58:03.388 --> 58:05.658
If we can't compete,
we could lose the business.

58:06.626 --> 58:09.560
I don't want you to worry,
you're gonna be great.

58:10.428 --> 58:12.429
I just hope that we have
what Mr. Hoffman wants,

58:12.431 --> 58:14.733
and if we don't, we don't.

58:15.200 --> 58:17.003
All right? And we're gonna
figure something out.

58:17.570 --> 58:18.802
- Okay?
- Yeah.

58:18.804 --> 58:21.305
We spend how much
every year on staplers?

58:21.307 --> 58:23.575
Oh. I need to rein
your father in.

59:10.693 --> 59:13.660
Okay, Mr. Hoffman,
esteemed colleagues,

59:13.662 --> 59:16.231
we want to extend
our warmest thanks to you

59:16.597 --> 59:19.201
for traveling so far
to meet with us today...

59:19.435 --> 59:21.903
Um, it's too much, though,
right, it's too formal?

59:22.270 --> 59:23.570
I had this perfect,
it was perfect,

59:23.572 --> 59:25.338
and now I can't
remember how I started it.

59:25.340 --> 59:28.276
I just think that we need
to get some sleep.

59:30.747 --> 59:32.780
You are going to nail
this presentation tomorrow.

59:32.782 --> 59:35.349
This deal is dead if it
doesn't go well tomorrow.

59:35.351 --> 59:37.820
George, I am well aware.

59:38.353 --> 59:40.554
We have both put
months of work into this,

59:40.556 --> 59:43.159
and a few extra hours tonight
isn't going to save it.

59:43.927 --> 59:47.965
Okay? It's just going to make us
both tired and unable to focus.

59:48.331 --> 59:50.099
Okay, okay, you're right.

59:50.400 --> 59:52.602
Thank you. Sorry.

59:54.872 --> 59:55.839
Good night.

59:57.842 --> 59:59.310
If it goes well,
we could...

59:59.910 --> 01:00:01.844
there could be
a Modern Skate park downtown.

01:00:01.846 --> 01:00:03.013
George...

01:00:03.848 --> 01:00:04.814
sleep.

01:00:08.586 --> 01:00:10.352
Did you like
"esteemed colleagues"

01:00:10.354 --> 01:00:11.588
because I could say
"honored colleagues..."

01:00:11.590 --> 01:00:12.756
George...

01:00:13.524 --> 01:00:15.592
- I'm just saying it's an easy switch.
- Sleep.

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.629
Sleep.

01:00:21.867 --> 01:00:23.034
Okay.

01:00:24.469 --> 01:00:26.805
- But you feel good about it, right?
- George, oh, my goodness!

01:00:27.639 --> 01:00:28.839
I love you.

01:00:28.841 --> 01:00:30.707
- I love you, too.
- Thanks for loving me.

01:00:30.709 --> 01:00:31.876
I know it's hard.

01:01:27.068 --> 01:01:28.236
Mom?

01:01:29.804 --> 01:01:30.972
Sally?

01:01:32.774 --> 01:01:33.741
Dad?

01:01:38.013 --> 01:01:39.214
Ahh!

01:01:41.851 --> 01:01:43.385
Mrs. Crowley.

01:01:44.086 --> 01:01:45.718
What are you doing here?

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:49.224
Mmm. I dropped the blacklist
a few days early.

01:01:49.558 --> 01:01:52.025
Your father sounded desperate
on the phone.

01:01:52.027 --> 01:01:55.163
And he promised to make me
some saffron risotto.

01:02:01.537 --> 01:02:02.671
Hello?

01:02:03.273 --> 01:02:06.142
Hello, Mom.
Why is Mrs. Crowley here?

01:02:06.443 --> 01:02:08.744
Your father thought it was gonna
be best for you to stay home.

01:02:09.012 --> 01:02:11.080
<i>He just wasn't sure
how Mr. Hoffman would feel</i>

01:02:11.082 --> 01:02:13.048
with a kid running
around at the meeting.

01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:15.116
But I thought I was going
with you guys today.

01:02:15.118 --> 01:02:17.019
Tommy, I'm sorry.

01:02:17.021 --> 01:02:19.390
<i>I... Maybe you can stop by
after the meeting, okay?</i>

01:02:20.091 --> 01:02:21.724
I'm sorry, I have to go.

01:02:22.193 --> 01:02:23.761
No, no, no...

01:02:26.529 --> 01:02:27.864
That's too late.

01:02:28.766 --> 01:02:29.965
I'm toast.

01:02:29.967 --> 01:02:31.700
<i>Toast?</i>

01:02:31.702 --> 01:02:33.903
<i>No, that smells more
like creamed wheat.</i>

01:02:33.905 --> 01:02:35.340
I don't think she's looking.

01:02:35.606 --> 01:02:36.874
Okay, come on, let's go.

01:03:01.134 --> 01:03:02.268
Hey, Tommy!

01:03:06.005 --> 01:03:06.973
Hey, Buddy!

01:03:09.042 --> 01:03:10.910
Good morning, Alice.
Always a pleasure.

01:03:12.545 --> 01:03:14.045
You ready for this?

01:03:14.047 --> 01:03:15.780
As I'll ever be.

01:03:16.082 --> 01:03:17.950
All right, what tricks
are you gonna do?

01:03:17.952 --> 01:03:19.917
Did Sal give you pointers
last night?

01:03:19.919 --> 01:03:22.888
I don't know,
I don't have any tricks.

01:03:22.890 --> 01:03:24.424
Look, you gotta
have something.

01:03:25.793 --> 01:03:27.725
- Wait, not even an ollie-to-manual?
- No.

01:03:27.727 --> 01:03:29.295
It's pretty simple, here,
let me show you how to do it.

01:03:29.297 --> 01:03:30.562
Alice!

01:03:30.564 --> 01:03:32.197
I don't want you to show me!

01:03:32.199 --> 01:03:34.032
I suck at skateboarding.

01:03:34.034 --> 01:03:36.802
I get it, and everyone else
is better at it than I am.

01:03:36.804 --> 01:03:38.637
Well, I didn't
mean it like that.

01:03:38.639 --> 01:03:41.207
It's fine, okay?

01:03:41.209 --> 01:03:44.445
This is my problem, and I
need to deal with it myself.

01:03:46.881 --> 01:03:50.251
Fine, you wanna be by yourself
so bad, then be my guest.

01:03:52.554 --> 01:03:54.188
Alice, I'm sorry, I...

01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:56.990
You know, I think I'm
gonna ride on ahead myself.

01:03:56.992 --> 01:03:58.257
I'll see you there, Tommy.

01:03:58.259 --> 01:03:59.861
You, too? Buddy?

01:04:09.238 --> 01:04:11.138
How cute.

01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:13.040
Looks like the whole pack
is here except the leader.

01:04:13.042 --> 01:04:14.443
Excuse me?

01:04:14.777 --> 01:04:16.878
I'm sorry, Alice.
I didn't mean to...

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.015
Hey, I'm a lone wolf,
and you better watch yourself.

01:04:25.788 --> 01:04:27.156
Let's get this over with.

01:04:27.857 --> 01:04:28.858
Agreed.

01:04:35.099 --> 01:04:36.199
Hey, George.

01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:37.967
Mr. Hoffman's here.

01:04:38.602 --> 01:04:39.569
Okay.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.875
Mr. Hoffman, esteemed
colleagues, friends...

01:04:58.856 --> 01:05:01.757
Scooter! I'm glad
you could make it.

01:05:01.759 --> 01:05:03.859
For a minute there, I thought
you weren't gonna show,

01:05:03.861 --> 01:05:06.129
but from what I've seen, that
may have been the wiser choice.

01:05:06.131 --> 01:05:08.031
Let's just get
this over with.

01:05:08.033 --> 01:05:10.232
What's that? I don't
think they heard you.

01:05:10.234 --> 01:05:12.736
I said, let's just
get this over with.

01:05:12.738 --> 01:05:14.406
Oh. We're just
getting started.

01:05:16.342 --> 01:05:19.276
On Monday, I was riding down the
street, minding my own business,

01:05:19.278 --> 01:05:23.049
when Tommy Schooner here, in a hurry
to get somewhere, bowled me over.

01:05:28.855 --> 01:05:32.223
I never seen him coming, but seeing
how much of a skilled skater he is,

01:05:32.225 --> 01:05:33.393
he had to see me.

01:05:34.194 --> 01:05:35.428
<i>He said to me...</i>

01:05:36.062 --> 01:05:37.695
Get out of my way,
you little pip-squeak.

01:05:37.697 --> 01:05:39.898
"Get out of my way,
you pip-squeak."

01:05:41.202 --> 01:05:42.401
I never said that.

01:05:42.403 --> 01:05:44.303
Quiet, I'm telling a story.

01:05:45.405 --> 01:05:48.840
<i>So there I was, afraid of
what this big bully...</i>

01:05:50.944 --> 01:05:52.614
...of a kid was
gonna do to me.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.048
Was he gonna take
my lunch money?

01:05:59.053 --> 01:06:01.421
There wasn't school on Monday.
Why would you have lunch money?

01:06:01.423 --> 01:06:03.991
Was he gonna take
my beloved skateboard?

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:06.461
<i>What would I do
with two skateboards?</i>

01:06:07.661 --> 01:06:09.997
Or was he just gonna beat me up and
leave me on the side of the street?

01:06:11.199 --> 01:06:13.967
<i>Not to mention, my dad
owns a skateboarding company.</i>

01:06:13.969 --> 01:06:16.236
I really have
no use for your board.

01:06:16.238 --> 01:06:18.238
You're really hung up
on that point, aren't you?

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.974
Yeah, yeah, kind of.

01:06:20.475 --> 01:06:22.909
No, instead, he said...

01:06:22.911 --> 01:06:24.844
I'm gonna humiliate you
in front of everybody.

01:06:24.846 --> 01:06:27.046
...this Friday,
at the skate-off.

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:47.402
Wow, I really remember those
events happening differently.

01:06:47.404 --> 01:06:49.371
Hope I'm not
sleepwalking again.

01:06:49.373 --> 01:06:53.610
Mr. Hoffman, esteemed friends,
welcome, again, to Modern Skate.

01:07:18.203 --> 01:07:21.037
So here we are.
Today's the day.

01:07:21.039 --> 01:07:23.906
The gauntlet was thrown,
the challenge was accepted.

01:07:23.908 --> 01:07:26.509
I feel like I represent
all little guys when I say,

01:07:26.511 --> 01:07:29.912
enough is enough,
and stand up to this bully.

01:07:29.914 --> 01:07:32.181
I'm vastly outmatched
by his superior skill,

01:07:32.183 --> 01:07:33.115
but I can only hope that...

01:07:33.117 --> 01:07:34.318
Just go on with it already!

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:35.320
Right, yeah.

01:07:35.521 --> 01:07:36.655
Sorry.

01:07:37.089 --> 01:07:38.657
Grip or graphic?

01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:40.157
Grip.

01:07:50.402 --> 01:07:51.370
Grip it is.

01:07:52.104 --> 01:07:53.473
You wanna go first or second?

01:07:53.873 --> 01:07:55.340
Uh, you can go first.

01:07:55.342 --> 01:07:58.377
My "superior" skills can wait
just a little bit longer.

01:08:01.348 --> 01:08:03.381
Okay, video is one thing,

01:08:03.383 --> 01:08:06.485
but let's see how it compares
to the real deal.

01:08:06.487 --> 01:08:10.591
Now as you can see, Sally is
riding on the new Talon Mark IV.

01:08:10.857 --> 01:08:12.157
Now this model
isn't even out yet,

01:08:12.159 --> 01:08:13.958
but I can assure you,

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.595
it's going to blow the Mark
III numbers out of the water.

01:08:16.598 --> 01:08:19.163
Now, our chief engineer,
Jerome Walker,

01:08:19.166 --> 01:08:21.134
can explain
the improvements we've made.

01:08:21.569 --> 01:08:22.804
Right on, thank you, George.

01:08:23.104 --> 01:08:25.072
Sure, and in English, please.

01:08:26.207 --> 01:08:29.542
The Mark IV uses a new polycarbon
synthetic in the board

01:08:29.544 --> 01:08:31.444
which increases
the tensile strength

01:08:31.446 --> 01:08:33.511
and decreases the mass
by an order of 25.

01:08:33.514 --> 01:08:35.283
But...

01:08:36.318 --> 01:08:39.654
In other words, we've made our
boards stronger and lighter.

01:08:39.854 --> 01:08:41.254
We've also increased
the coeffic...

01:08:41.256 --> 01:08:43.658
The
slipperiness of the bearings,

01:08:43.992 --> 01:08:46.796
making this the smoothest gliding
board that has ever been made.

01:08:47.062 --> 01:08:49.363
It's like... It's like
you're riding on a cloud.

01:08:49.599 --> 01:08:51.466
- George.
- Thanks, Jerome.

01:08:51.899 --> 01:08:54.335
And we've already spoken
with our manufacturers,

01:08:54.337 --> 01:08:57.171
and they're ready to increase
output to match demand.

01:08:58.374 --> 01:08:59.341
Any questions?

01:09:05.482 --> 01:09:07.247
Rules are as follows:

01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:10.787
each person has 30 seconds to
complete as many tricks as possible.

01:09:11.087 --> 01:09:14.423
When finished, our panel of
judges will hold up their scores.

01:09:14.924 --> 01:09:15.890
The highest score wins.

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:17.560
Good luck.

01:09:18.162 --> 01:09:19.228
You're gonna need it.

01:09:19.996 --> 01:09:21.062
Thanks.

01:09:21.064 --> 01:09:22.264
You, too, Frankie.

01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:24.701
Start the clock!

01:09:48.393 --> 01:09:49.959
You can have the rest
of my time, Tommy.

01:09:49.961 --> 01:09:51.629
I don't think
I'm gonna need it.

01:09:52.231 --> 01:09:54.465
I give the rest of my time
to my opponent.

01:09:57.369 --> 01:09:58.671
What's the score?

01:09:59.271 --> 01:10:01.540
I'd give it a six.
Six and a half.

01:10:08.547 --> 01:10:09.548
A 9.1?

01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:11.918
What routine
were you watching?

01:10:12.385 --> 01:10:15.254
All right, Tommy,
give him what he deserves.

01:10:16.223 --> 01:10:17.724
So what's it gonna be, Tommy?

01:10:18.057 --> 01:10:19.793
I hope your sister
gave you some good advice.

01:10:20.727 --> 01:10:25.732
She did, actually, and she
said to do what I do best.

01:10:26.031 --> 01:10:27.767
Oh! I can't watch.

01:10:28.067 --> 01:10:30.336
And what I do best...

01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:34.239
isn't skateboarding, and I
stand no chance beating you.

01:10:35.309 --> 01:10:36.376
What I do best...

01:10:38.345 --> 01:10:39.312
is this.

01:10:46.087 --> 01:10:47.455
<i>Come on, Frankie!</i>

01:10:48.322 --> 01:10:49.957
<i>Sally's never gonna respect
moves like that.</i>

01:10:51.292 --> 01:10:53.693
That's what I do best.

01:10:53.695 --> 01:10:56.562
And if you don't stop bullying
these kids in this neighborhood,

01:10:56.564 --> 01:11:00.401
I'm gonna make sure everyone
in our school sees that video.

01:11:00.769 --> 01:11:03.703
And everybody knows
that I'm not a great skater,

01:11:03.705 --> 01:11:06.241
and I realize I have
nothing to lose,

01:11:06.442 --> 01:11:10.445
but you just proved how great
of a skateboarder you are,

01:11:10.447 --> 01:11:12.712
and when this video comes out,

01:11:12.714 --> 01:11:15.350
and that cute little
"eek" sound you make...

01:11:16.319 --> 01:11:18.587
Well, the bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

01:11:19.722 --> 01:11:23.359
Look, Tommy, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

01:11:24.294 --> 01:11:25.260
Really?

01:11:26.629 --> 01:11:29.530
Yeah, I mean,
your family is super cool.

01:11:29.532 --> 01:11:31.432
Your dad makes skateboards,
that's awesome.

01:11:31.434 --> 01:11:32.633
And your sister...

01:11:32.635 --> 01:11:35.571
Wait, you do have
a crush on my sister.

01:11:35.573 --> 01:11:37.373
What? No.

01:11:37.674 --> 01:11:38.841
Ugh!

01:11:39.375 --> 01:11:40.844
Gross, you do!

01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:42.243
- Ugh!
- Shut up, man!

01:11:42.245 --> 01:11:44.646
Man, it's cool.

01:11:44.648 --> 01:11:48.418
Just be a little nicer to me, and
I'll put in a few good words.

01:11:49.186 --> 01:11:51.755
Come on, is someone gonna skate?
I've got stuff to do!

01:11:52.691 --> 01:11:56.360
Hey, man, I'm sorry about
everything and here...

01:12:01.766 --> 01:12:04.502
I yield the rest of my time.

01:12:05.237 --> 01:12:06.403
Phew.

01:12:17.517 --> 01:12:20.385
A 2.0? What competition
were you watching?

01:12:20.719 --> 01:12:22.753
Right?

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:24.990
Let me know when the guy starts
judging dog shows, I'm in.

01:12:26.391 --> 01:12:31.228
I officially declare Frankie,
winner of today's skate-off.

01:12:39.438 --> 01:12:43.542
Frankie! Frankie!
Frankie! Frankie! Frankie!

01:12:52.586 --> 01:12:54.719
So that's who we are
as a company,

01:12:54.721 --> 01:12:59.291
and we hope that you'll see us
as a valuable investment,

01:12:59.293 --> 01:13:03.029
and agree to partner with us as we
go to the next level, together.

01:13:03.764 --> 01:13:05.633
Mr. Schooner, um...

01:13:06.701 --> 01:13:09.402
thank you very much for the
presentation, and for your hospitality.

01:13:10.204 --> 01:13:11.439
Uh...

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.407
Unfortunately, I cannot
invest in your company.

01:13:16.444 --> 01:13:19.013
Oh, uh...
Do you mind if I ask why?

01:13:19.614 --> 01:13:20.581
Quite simply...

01:13:22.351 --> 01:13:24.052
there's just nothing
special about it.

01:13:24.285 --> 01:13:25.887
I mean, you have
a lovely family,

01:13:26.354 --> 01:13:27.653
and your product seems
to be very good,

01:13:27.655 --> 01:13:29.791
and your daughter
is exceptionally talented,

01:13:30.158 --> 01:13:31.793
but I've seen this all before.

01:13:33.629 --> 01:13:36.665
I was really hoping to witness
something unique here today.

01:13:39.902 --> 01:13:41.037
I understand.

01:13:41.605 --> 01:13:43.772
Uh, would you at least
stay for lunch?

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:47.509
It'll be ready soon,
and we've got so much food.

01:13:49.411 --> 01:13:50.980
I appreciate the offer. Uh...

01:13:52.716 --> 01:13:54.484
Sure. We can stay for lunch.

01:13:55.719 --> 01:13:57.854
Okay, great, lunch it is.

01:14:03.493 --> 01:14:04.662
You lost.

01:14:05.596 --> 01:14:09.098
I know, the skate-off at least.
And hopefully, not a friend.

01:14:09.934 --> 01:14:13.602
I was being a jerk back
there, and I was stressed,

01:14:13.604 --> 01:14:15.471
and I knew you were
trying to help,

01:14:16.574 --> 01:14:19.710
but took my stress out on you, and
I've just gotta stop doing that.

01:14:20.678 --> 01:14:21.979
We cool?

01:14:24.515 --> 01:14:27.551
I left my 50-millimeter lens
at your house, so...

01:14:28.387 --> 01:14:29.654
I guess we're cool.

01:14:31.355 --> 01:14:32.822
Any news from Sally
on the presentation?

01:14:32.824 --> 01:14:34.726
Oh. Yeah, let me check.

01:14:57.349 --> 01:14:58.517
Oh, man.

01:14:59.485 --> 01:15:01.485
It's not going good.

01:15:01.487 --> 01:15:03.956
I knew I should've gone to the
meeting, my talents are wasted here.

01:15:04.257 --> 01:15:05.858
That's not good,
what was wrong?

01:15:06.927 --> 01:15:09.495
They wanted something unique.

01:15:09.696 --> 01:15:12.329
How about a skateboard
wrapped in bacon?

01:15:12.331 --> 01:15:14.267
Bet you've never seen
one of those before.

01:15:15.301 --> 01:15:16.270
Come on!

01:15:16.503 --> 01:15:17.769
Where are we going?

01:15:17.771 --> 01:15:19.740
Modern headquarters!
I have an idea!

01:15:22.777 --> 01:15:24.509
What's your idea?

01:15:24.511 --> 01:15:26.613
I'm gonna give
them something "unique."

01:15:27.548 --> 01:15:28.716
Whoa, wait!

01:15:33.353 --> 01:15:35.690
<i>Stop!</i>

01:15:50.572 --> 01:15:53.842
That was awesome!

01:15:54.710 --> 01:15:55.976
You are getting better.

01:15:55.978 --> 01:15:58.812
I give that a 20! Paws down!

01:15:58.814 --> 01:16:01.650
Maybe I should've tried a move
back there, against Frankie, huh?

01:16:02.785 --> 01:16:04.853
Well, let's not get ahead
of ourselves, okay?

01:16:04.855 --> 01:16:06.688
Oh.
We gotta get to Modern.

01:16:27.343 --> 01:16:28.978
George, you know what, we
actually misjudged the time,

01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:30.478
we have to get
to another meeting.

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:31.846
Oh, are you sure? It's just
gonna be a few minutes.

01:16:31.848 --> 01:16:33.016
No, no, it's fine.

01:16:36.854 --> 01:16:39.889
When we get there, we gotta
assess the situation, okay?

01:16:39.891 --> 01:16:42.958
We can't just be two kids and a dog
barging into an important meeting.

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:44.627
You got it, chief!

01:16:44.962 --> 01:16:46.864
Alice, I'm gonna need
your help with the TV.

01:16:50.601 --> 01:16:53.637
That smell. It's...
It's incredible!

01:16:53.639 --> 01:16:55.773
Sorry, Tommy,
no time to waste!

01:16:56.507 --> 01:16:57.775
Buddy, wait!

01:17:02.513 --> 01:17:04.447
- We do have to go, thank you, though.
- Okay.

01:17:04.449 --> 01:17:05.782
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you, Mr. Hoffman, thank you for your time.

01:17:05.784 --> 01:17:06.751
Of course.

01:17:07.019 --> 01:17:08.186
Buddy!

01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:07.148
Oh!

01:18:07.482 --> 01:18:09.648
- Uh... We're very sorry.
- So sorry!

01:18:09.650 --> 01:18:11.953
Uh, we are sorry.

01:18:12.721 --> 01:18:13.721
Alice?

01:18:14.456 --> 01:18:16.926
Oh. Sorry about the mess.

01:18:46.657 --> 01:18:50.225
I'm Tommy Schooner, I'm head
of special marketing projects,

01:18:50.227 --> 01:18:53.464
and I'm sure you've already
met Buddy Schooner,

01:18:53.897 --> 01:18:55.765
the other face
of Modern Skate.

01:18:56.833 --> 01:18:58.701
Pleasure!

01:18:58.703 --> 01:19:02.171
You wanted something unique, and
I give you, Buddy and Sally,

01:19:02.173 --> 01:19:07.744
the family skateboarding
human-dog team.

01:19:09.747 --> 01:19:11.782
We're still
work-shopping the name.

01:19:17.122 --> 01:19:17.888
Now that...

01:19:20.825 --> 01:19:22.027
is something unique.

01:19:23.929 --> 01:19:25.464
A skateboarding dog?

01:19:26.999 --> 01:19:27.966
It's brilliant.

01:19:31.003 --> 01:19:31.970
Mr. Schooner...

01:19:33.706 --> 01:19:35.341
I'm gonna invest
in your company.

01:19:36.642 --> 01:19:37.708
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

01:19:37.710 --> 01:19:38.910
Congratulations.

01:19:39.746 --> 01:19:41.946
- Thank you, Mr. Hoffman, thank you.
- Thank you so much.

01:19:41.948 --> 01:19:43.549
Sorry about your face.

01:19:44.150 --> 01:19:45.417
Thanks. Thanks, Bill.

01:19:46.219 --> 01:19:48.219
I do think the food's
still okay if we're careful.

01:19:48.221 --> 01:19:50.288
- No, we're fine.
- Or we could just order pizza.

01:19:50.290 --> 01:19:52.091
We'll order pizza.

01:19:52.093 --> 01:19:53.993
Bill, can we get some...
Put it on the company card.

01:20:06.673 --> 01:20:09.842
Great job, everybody. Now,
less hugging, more eating.

01:20:09.844 --> 01:20:11.344
Well, it was
certainly a pleasure

01:20:11.346 --> 01:20:13.612
to meet you and your lovely
family, Mr. Schooner.

01:20:13.614 --> 01:20:15.915
Hopefully, one day, you'll get out
to Los Angeles so you can meet mine.

01:20:15.917 --> 01:20:17.649
We'd be happy to.

01:20:17.651 --> 01:20:20.087
Thanks again for the opportunity.
You won't regret it.

01:20:20.821 --> 01:20:22.856
I know I won't. We're gonna
make a lot of money together.

01:20:22.858 --> 01:20:24.124
Great.

01:20:24.126 --> 01:20:25.758
Come on, honey,
let's show Mr. Hoffman out.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:27.227
Sounds good. Gentlemen.

01:20:30.298 --> 01:20:32.598
Tommy Schooner,
I owe you an apology.

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:34.836
I never knew you had such
a talent for filmmaking.

01:20:35.971 --> 01:20:38.306
Thanks, and it's okay.

01:20:39.007 --> 01:20:41.674
No. It was easy for me
to connect with your sister

01:20:41.676 --> 01:20:43.311
because we both like
the same things.

01:20:44.546 --> 01:20:47.148
But I should've spent more time getting
to know you and your interests,

01:20:47.150 --> 01:20:49.316
not just going to
the skate park with you

01:20:49.318 --> 01:20:51.554
because you started
being interested in mine.

01:20:52.622 --> 01:20:55.990
Thanks, Dad, and I know you've
had a lot on your plate.

01:20:55.992 --> 01:20:58.326
No, that's no excuse,
you're my son.

01:20:58.328 --> 01:21:00.429
I love you and I've
always got time for you.

01:21:01.297 --> 01:21:03.030
Plus, that video is amazing!

01:21:03.032 --> 01:21:04.534
You have more of those?

01:21:05.701 --> 01:21:09.905
Well, Alice and I did make a short
film about a ghost in our basement.

01:21:09.907 --> 01:21:11.408
Oh, what's it called?

01:21:12.009 --> 01:21:13.809
<i>The Ghost in the Basement.</i>

01:21:13.811 --> 01:21:15.277
Of course it is, all right.

01:21:15.279 --> 01:21:17.314
What did we know?
We were ten.

01:21:17.781 --> 01:21:19.983
Okay, I'll tell you what.

01:21:20.684 --> 01:21:23.419
When we get home tonight, we'll
watch <i>The Ghost in the Basement.</i>

01:21:23.421 --> 01:21:26.189
And then if you want,
spend the summer here,

01:21:26.723 --> 01:21:28.159
making videos
for the campaign.

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:31.860
You gave yourself a title, the
least I can do is give you a desk.

01:21:31.862 --> 01:21:34.232
- Sound good?
- Sounds great!

01:21:36.267 --> 01:21:38.868
Now be honest,
do you like the quinoa?

01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:41.105
Ugh. No, I've been flushing it down
the toilet for about a week...

01:21:41.107 --> 01:21:42.206
Thank you.

01:21:42.408 --> 01:21:44.140
I see
you guys watching me.

01:21:44.142 --> 01:21:45.543
I'm always in the spotlight.

01:21:46.212 --> 01:21:47.613
Nice job with the video.

01:21:48.114 --> 01:21:49.981
Thanks.

01:21:50.949 --> 01:21:51.516
I hope you don't mind sharing
the spotlight with a dog.

01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:52.850
It's not just any dog.

01:21:52.852 --> 01:21:55.621
It's the best skateboarding
dog in the whole world.

01:21:55.988 --> 01:21:59.823
Go ahead, shower me with compliments,
but I still won't work on weekends.

01:21:59.825 --> 01:22:00.993
So how'd your skate-off go?

01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:03.462
Okay. I lost.

01:22:04.697 --> 01:22:06.999
- There's no surprise there.
- Nope.

01:22:07.267 --> 01:22:08.934
Did you attempt any tricks?

01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:14.139
No. I did take your advice,
and kind of feel bad about it.

01:22:14.141 --> 01:22:15.307
How so?

01:22:17.811 --> 01:22:19.844
It's wrong to bully someone,

01:22:19.846 --> 01:22:22.383
even though you're trying to
get him to stop bullying you.

01:22:23.217 --> 01:22:24.383
Correct.

01:22:24.385 --> 01:22:26.386
Two wrongs don't
make a right.

01:22:26.753 --> 01:22:30.089
Two wrongs don't make
a right, but three lefts do!

01:22:31.192 --> 01:22:33.493
Do you think you could
give me a hand with something?

01:22:33.495 --> 01:22:34.728
Of course.

01:22:35.196 --> 01:22:36.163
Thanks.

01:22:38.732 --> 01:22:40.569
Oh, yeah,
I'm shredding!

01:22:41.303 --> 01:22:42.603
Check it out!

01:22:46.208 --> 01:22:47.375
Hey, Frankie!

01:22:48.075 --> 01:22:49.409
Oh. Hey, Scoot...

01:22:49.411 --> 01:22:50.978
I mean, Schooner.

01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:54.349
Come to say hi?

01:22:55.417 --> 01:22:57.984
Yeah, and to apologize.

01:22:57.986 --> 01:23:01.022
Kind of a bully move I pulled
back there, using the video.

01:23:06.329 --> 01:23:08.497
- We good?
- Yeah, we good.

01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:12.933
Oh, and...
someone's here to see you.

01:23:12.935 --> 01:23:14.135
Huh?

01:23:15.506 --> 01:23:16.504
Sa...

01:23:16.506 --> 01:23:17.538
Hey, Frankie.

01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:19.275
Sally Schooner?

01:23:19.542 --> 01:23:21.409
It's good to see you again.

01:23:21.411 --> 01:23:23.513
I heard you won some sort of
amateur skate competition today?

01:23:23.947 --> 01:23:26.280
Yup, I guess I did.

01:23:26.282 --> 01:23:29.252
Well, I just wanna say
congratulations, and give you this.

01:23:31.921 --> 01:23:33.356
See you around, Frankie.

01:23:37.428 --> 01:23:39.193
Hey, thanks for
your help today.

01:23:39.195 --> 01:23:41.163
You did a great job pretending
to flirt with Frankie.

01:23:41.165 --> 01:23:42.432
Who said I was pretending?

01:23:43.801 --> 01:23:45.867
Ugh. Gross, no, Frankie?

01:23:45.869 --> 01:23:48.170
What?
He's kind of cute.

01:23:48.172 --> 01:23:50.240
Ugh. I can't,
I'm gonna be sick.

01:23:57.849 --> 01:23:59.215
You coming, dear?

01:23:59.217 --> 01:24:00.316
We're about to watch
<i>Ghost in the Basement.</i>

01:24:00.318 --> 01:24:02.151
In the basement.

01:24:02.153 --> 01:24:04.355
I'm coming, I'm coming.
All right, who wants popcorn?

01:24:04.357 --> 01:24:08.092
Uh, I think everybody. So,
Tommy, how long is this movie?

01:24:08.426 --> 01:24:10.529
It's about... four hours.

01:24:11.963 --> 01:24:13.464
Okay, wow.

01:24:13.466 --> 01:24:15.466
No. He's kidding, it's like 12 minutes.

01:24:15.468 --> 01:24:18.102
Thank goodness, because I did not
make enough popcorn for that.

01:24:18.104 --> 01:24:22.107
All right, I guess it's time to
hit it on <i>Ghost in the Basement.</i>

01:24:23.209 --> 01:24:24.376
And...

01:24:24.877 --> 01:24:26.110
Action!

01:24:50.370 --> 01:24:51.672
And cut!

01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:53.239
Nice.

01:24:53.241 --> 01:24:55.040
All right,
that work for you guys?

01:24:55.042 --> 01:24:56.474
- Yeah, great.
- Yeah, that works for us.

01:24:56.476 --> 01:24:58.444
Then that's the last shot
before lunch.

01:24:58.446 --> 01:24:59.979
- Good!
- Great!

01:24:59.981 --> 01:25:01.913
Hey, Sally, Buddy, why don't
you guys come over here?

01:25:01.915 --> 01:25:03.517
I wanna get a nice group photo
of all of us for the website.

01:25:03.519 --> 01:25:05.451
Good idea, Ma Schooner.

01:25:05.453 --> 01:25:07.888
Let's make sure the Modern
banner's in the picture.

01:25:08.323 --> 01:25:10.692
There we go... all right.

01:25:16.532 --> 01:25:18.634
Hold the phone.
Do I smell...

01:25:20.569 --> 01:25:23.305
Oh, my gosh.
That smells like...

01:25:23.539 --> 01:25:25.807
Oh, it can't be.
Oh, it is!

01:25:33.516 --> 01:25:35.683
Oh, my gosh, it's steak!

01:25:35.685 --> 01:25:38.218
Oh, come on, guys, I'm being
good, take the picture.

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:40.556
Hurry up, I'm so hungry!

01:25:41.391 --> 01:25:43.258
Oh, man, I can't wait!

01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:45.829
- Take the picture.
- Come on, guys, I'm being good.

01:25:46.262 --> 01:25:47.330
I'm a good boy!

01:26:18.129 --> 01:26:20.932
<i>Please
welcome Tony Hawk!</i>

01:26:22.634 --> 01:26:24.467
- Hey, what's up, George?
- Hey, man.

01:26:24.469 --> 01:26:26.603
- Good to see you!
- You, too. Thanks for coming out.

01:26:26.605 --> 01:26:29.439
Congrats on taking Modern
Skate global, that's huge.

01:26:29.441 --> 01:26:32.208
Yeah, dude, well, we couldn't
have done it without you.

01:26:32.210 --> 01:26:34.010
- Seriously, thanks, man.
- See you, man.

01:26:34.012 --> 01:26:35.346
Yeah, get back to your stuff.

01:27:02.408 --> 01:27:05.312
Oh, man. I just had
the craziest dream.

01:27:05.512 --> 01:27:07.514
Wouldn't it be cool
if I could snowboard?

01:27:10.067 --> 01:27:15.067
