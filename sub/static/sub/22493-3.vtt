I'm Trapped
Episode 4x3 (63)

00:35.563 --> 00:37.697
Synchro : ianOnTheNet
ian-and-robot-chicken.blogspot.com

00:38.286 --> 00:40.631
Oh, looks like he was saying,

00:40.756 --> 00:42.521
"Grape, Grape Ape".

00:42.646 --> 00:44.552
Now I understand.
I didn't hear the "g", though.

00:44.677 --> 00:45.993
Did anybody hear the "g"?

00:46.424 --> 00:48.948
# Well, there are words
that you can say #

00:49.073 --> 00:50.761
like nouns, adjectives,
and verbs.

00:50.886 --> 00:53.409
# And there are things
you just can't say #

00:53.534 --> 00:55.122
Like curses and racist remarks.

00:55.247 --> 00:57.815
# And people say it's not okay #

00:57.940 --> 00:59.331
To ever confuse the two.

00:59.456 --> 01:01.248
# 'Cause it makes them frown #

01:01.610 --> 01:03.406
# But I think it's profound #

01:03.531 --> 01:06.990
# 'Cause my teacher tells
my folks I've got tourettes #

01:07.115 --> 01:08.248
# Do, do, do, do, do #

01:08.758 --> 01:11.516
# I say "bitch" and "pussy",
but I really mean two of my pets #

01:11.641 --> 01:12.775
# Do, do, do, do, do #

01:13.365 --> 01:16.310
# I can say "ass" 'cause it's something
I saw some say it's a curse #

01:16.435 --> 01:17.674
# I say, "hee-haw" #

01:17.799 --> 01:20.454
# I talk in a way
that no one gets #

01:21.235 --> 01:23.890
# 'Cause there are words that
sound the same #

01:24.015 --> 01:25.712
like "dam" and "pecker" and "gay".

01:25.837 --> 01:28.155
# and then some words are
spelled the same #

01:28.280 --> 01:30.048
like "knockers" and "cock"
and "snatch".

01:30.173 --> 01:32.615
# So people really can't complain

01:32.740 --> 01:34.306
when I use them as I please #

01:34.431 --> 01:36.411
# 'Cause they're homonyms #

01:36.536 --> 01:38.283
# Yes, they're homonyms #

01:38.408 --> 01:42.558
# So, when I yell out "fag"
and "chink" and "dike" #

01:43.593 --> 01:46.862
# They mean different things,
so I'm clearly within my right #

01:48.181 --> 01:52.517
# I could just yell out "homonym",
but I prefer the "homo" spin #

01:52.642 --> 01:55.697
# I'm teaching the world
'bout homo-nyms #

01:55.822 --> 01:56.753
Yeah!

01:56.954 --> 01:59.658
# I'm teaching the world
'bout homo-nyms #

01:59.783 --> 02:01.066
Everybody!

02:01.191 --> 02:02.485
# I'm teaching the world #

02:02.610 --> 02:04.880
# let class begin #

02:05.719 --> 02:07.871
Ahh, Afghanistan!

02:07.996 --> 02:10.854
An appearance by the vice president
should really perk up the troops.

02:10.979 --> 02:12.850
Sir, I'm concerned about
the security risks.

02:12.975 --> 02:15.177
Don't be such
a bed-wetting a-hole!

02:15.302 --> 02:16.742
We're totally incognito!

02:34.611 --> 02:35.916
Mr. American Vice President,

02:36.041 --> 02:37.826
you have suffered
a severe heart attack!

02:37.951 --> 02:39.505
35 and counting, Jafar.

02:39.630 --> 02:42.391
I had to construct a pacemaker
to keep your heart beating.

02:42.516 --> 02:44.305
I'm afraid I did not have
much to work with,

02:44.430 --> 02:46.385
but on the bright side,
you can play Simon on it.

02:47.656 --> 02:49.848
That's very funny.
Could keep yourself occupied for hours.

02:50.595 --> 02:53.485
Now you will use
your American military secrets

02:53.610 --> 02:55.664
to build us weapons or die!

02:55.789 --> 02:57.405
Look, I made one already!

02:58.697 --> 03:00.615
I call it the Cheney special.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.338
We'll take 1 ,000.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.921
Mr. Vice President,
is that really you?

03:05.046 --> 03:06.343
Who wants to know?

03:06.468 --> 03:07.410
I'm Tony Stark.

03:07.535 --> 03:09.970
I've built weapons for
the U.S. military for decades.

03:10.095 --> 03:10.940
Don't worry.

03:11.065 --> 03:11.969
I have a plan.

03:12.094 --> 03:14.896
i've spent the last month
secretly building this battle armor

03:15.021 --> 03:16.215
right under their noses.

03:16.340 --> 03:18.798
I'll wear the armor,
fight my way out of here,

03:18.923 --> 03:22.552
cross the desert, find civilization,
and get you rescued!

03:27.096 --> 03:28.235
Booyah.

03:31.893 --> 03:33.554
Go fuck yourselves!

03:34.529 --> 03:36.053
Go fuck yourself!

03:36.178 --> 03:38.024
Go fuck yourself!

03:38.485 --> 03:40.233
Go fuck yourself!

03:40.575 --> 03:41.563
Go fuck yourself!

03:41.688 --> 03:42.966
Go fuck yourself!

03:43.560 --> 03:45.181
Go fuck yourself!
Go fuck yourself!

03:45.306 --> 03:46.840
Go fuck yourself!
Go fuck yourself!

03:46.965 --> 03:48.184
Fuck yourself!

03:48.309 --> 03:49.232
Fuck yourself!

03:49.357 --> 03:50.344
Go fuck yourself!

03:57.116 --> 03:59.089
Eh, thought he was a bird.

03:59.628 --> 04:02.153
Me Chunk. Me friend!

04:02.278 --> 04:03.032
Unh!

04:03.157 --> 04:03.941
Huh?

04:07.228 --> 04:08.771
No, stop it!

04:08.896 --> 04:11.369
Sloth love Chunk!

04:12.714 --> 04:14.831
I was wrong about you,
Christmas Jones.

04:14.956 --> 04:15.714
How so?

04:15.839 --> 04:18.382
I thought Christmas
only came once a year.

04:18.838 --> 04:20.137
Oh, James.

04:20.262 --> 04:21.341
There he is!

04:21.466 --> 04:23.059
I heard you saved
the world... again!

04:23.184 --> 04:25.294
So you and Christmas Jones, huh?

04:25.419 --> 04:27.045
I can't believe
you're tapping that!

04:27.170 --> 04:28.619
Sorry to break it to you, boys...

04:28.744 --> 04:31.247
Miss Jones is already
yesterday's news.

04:31.949 --> 04:33.227
This is me, up on the left.

04:33.352 --> 04:36.315
Oh, that's odd. I'd have thought
you lived on 34th street.

04:36.440 --> 04:38.982
Oh, right, because of...
my name.

04:39.609 --> 04:42.375
All right, love,
time to dick your halls.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.091
Could you maybe stop doing
the pun thing?

04:45.216 --> 04:47.429
I can't believe I made it
this far into Christmas

04:47.554 --> 04:49.176
without wrapping my present.

04:49.301 --> 04:51.612
Wha... wait a second!
I'm not on the pill!

04:51.737 --> 04:54.560
Well, I hope you've been
dreaming of a white Christmas.

04:55.419 --> 04:56.549
I just got a headache.

04:56.674 --> 04:59.088
So, when do I get to meet
your friends?

04:59.213 --> 05:00.462
Uh...

05:01.055 --> 05:04.195
So I said, "I thought Christmas
only came once a year".

05:04.320 --> 05:05.243
James...

05:05.368 --> 05:06.863
This guy's a tool.

05:07.330 --> 05:09.147
He's got a really cool car.

05:09.538 --> 05:11.203
You're breaking up with me?

05:11.328 --> 05:13.066
There's nothing wrong
with you, James.

05:13.191 --> 05:14.903
Maybe it's just an age thing.

05:15.028 --> 05:17.807
What, you think I'm too old
for Christmas?

05:17.932 --> 05:19.194
If that helps you, yes.

05:25.190 --> 05:26.118
Oh, come on!

05:26.243 --> 05:28.505
One of these fucking things
has to be loaded!

05:32.963 --> 05:35.137
So I just looked at her,
and I said,

05:35.262 --> 05:38.580
"well, I'm sorry, dear,
but I'm canceling Christmas".

05:38.705 --> 05:40.587
Oh, you dog!

05:40.712 --> 05:43.070
You're always humping and dumping.
You're the best, James!

05:43.195 --> 05:46.724
Ah, you know me...
I got to be James.

05:50.838 --> 05:52.468
Did you enjoy the movie, sir?

06:07.364 --> 06:08.545
Delete, delete!

06:14.622 --> 06:15.916
I'm on...

06:16.041 --> 06:19.740
...fire!

06:38.359 --> 06:40.525
I've got the weekend
box-office numbers, sir.

06:49.088 --> 06:50.623
Who wants to see
where daddy works?

06:50.748 --> 06:52.842
Me, me! I do, I do!

06:55.326 --> 06:58.010
The box-office returns from
"The Adventures of Pluto Nash"

06:58.135 --> 06:59.948
claimed over 57 lives.

07:00.073 --> 07:01.946
In 2003,
the United States Congress

07:02.071 --> 07:03.821
memorialized
the terrible tragedy

07:03.946 --> 07:07.035
by establishing
August 16th as Pluto Nash day.

07:09.487 --> 07:10.603
Who packed my chute?

07:10.728 --> 07:13.179
I did.
Why? Don't you trust me?

07:13.878 --> 07:14.972
Are we gonna jump,

07:15.097 --> 07:16.866
or are we just gonna
jerk each other off?

07:25.328 --> 07:26.438
Behold!

07:26.563 --> 07:30.562
An invitation to King Randor's
birthday party!

07:30.687 --> 07:33.492
This is our chance to conquer
Castle Grayskull

07:33.617 --> 07:35.150
once and for all!

07:35.275 --> 07:39.008
I'm sure we're not on
the guest list, Skeletor.

07:39.133 --> 07:41.323
Of course not,
you stupid twat

07:41.448 --> 07:45.405
but what if we had a magical
clone of He-Man?

07:45.530 --> 07:48.268
Well, I suppose,
hypothetically.

07:48.393 --> 07:49.607
Unh-unh-unh, we do!

07:49.732 --> 07:52.408
We have a magical clone
of He-Man.

07:53.187 --> 07:54.568
# Da da-da daa #

07:54.693 --> 07:57.619
What the hell is this,
Beast Man?

07:57.744 --> 07:58.757
He's blue!

07:58.882 --> 08:00.026
Well, I'm half-dog.

08:00.151 --> 08:01.654
Everything's shades of gray
to me.

08:01.779 --> 08:03.071
Me He-Man!

08:03.196 --> 08:05.951
Oh, and his personal pronouns
are all fucked up.

08:06.076 --> 08:08.210
I mean, where's the verb
in that sentence?

08:11.072 --> 08:12.926
Eh, I'm a gambler.

08:19.098 --> 08:22.011
That's the thing
about feudal agriculture.

08:27.616 --> 08:30.261
Hey, just who the heck do you
think you...

08:30.386 --> 08:31.798
Out my way, homo!

08:31.923 --> 08:33.755
He hit that nail on the head.

08:36.578 --> 08:39.130
He-Man!
What a pleasant surprise!

08:39.255 --> 08:40.741
We weren't expecting you.

08:40.866 --> 08:42.716
Nice boobies!

08:42.841 --> 08:43.429
Oh!

08:43.830 --> 08:44.691
Oh, my.

08:44.816 --> 08:45.837
Thank you, He-Man.

08:45.962 --> 08:48.042
He-man, you look cold!

08:48.167 --> 08:49.842
I brought you some piping-hot...

08:50.953 --> 08:53.090
My eyes are blistering!

08:53.215 --> 08:54.372
Why-y-y?!

08:57.049 --> 08:59.052
We'll see about this!

08:59.177 --> 08:59.935
Ha!

09:01.892 --> 09:02.795
You hear that?

09:02.920 --> 09:05.550
Faker must be going all
blood-crazy on their asses!

09:05.675 --> 09:07.568
# Let's have a party #

09:09.811 --> 09:10.779
What did I miss?

09:10.904 --> 09:12.825
He-man pulled the stick out
of his butt,

09:12.950 --> 09:15.783
and he's whipping
this party's ass with it!

09:20.055 --> 09:21.824
What the hell, man?

09:22.731 --> 09:25.019
Well, what do you have to say
for yourself?

09:30.595 --> 09:32.719
# Let's have a party #

09:34.722 --> 09:36.078
Oh, poopie.

09:38.885 --> 09:40.102
Hey, everybody!

09:40.227 --> 09:41.275
I'm here!

09:41.400 --> 09:43.747
It's me, the real He-Man!

09:53.988 --> 09:55.286
You little turds!

09:55.670 --> 09:58.237
Those... those were
my archenemies!

09:58.362 --> 09:59.590
How dare you!

09:59.715 --> 10:01.207
Two He-Mans?

10:01.764 --> 10:03.806
Wouldn't the plural be
He-Men?

10:04.239 --> 10:06.418
Which one is the real
He-Men?

10:06.543 --> 10:10.317
Citizens of Eternia, I am
shocked at this behavior!

10:10.442 --> 10:11.531
Excessive violence?

10:11.656 --> 10:12.769
Binge drinking?

10:12.894 --> 10:15.114
Haven't I set a better example
than that?

10:15.866 --> 10:16.726
You stink!

10:16.851 --> 10:18.789
This He-Man sure sucks
the fun out of a room.

10:19.206 --> 10:21.076
You're ruining my party!

10:21.585 --> 10:23.210
- L...
- I'll make this simple.

10:23.335 --> 10:26.585
Everyone who thinks this is the
real He-Man, raise your hands!

10:27.670 --> 10:30.016
Everyone who thinks this is
the real He-Man,

10:30.141 --> 10:31.205
raise your hands!

10:31.978 --> 10:33.728
Well, then it's settled.

10:33.958 --> 10:35.853
# Let's have a party #

10:36.707 --> 10:38.151
Dance, dance, dance!

10:38.276 --> 10:39.970
Oh, yeah, I boogie, boogie!

10:40.095 --> 10:41.219
Dance, dance, dance!

10:41.344 --> 10:43.208
Well done, Prince Adam!

10:43.333 --> 10:44.809
Who Prince Adam?

10:45.083 --> 10:45.972
Oops!

10:46.097 --> 10:47.376
Boogie, boogie, boogie!

10:56.780 --> 10:58.922
# Let's have a party #

10:59.047 --> 11:01.186
# Don't you be tardy #

11:01.311 --> 11:03.415
# Let's have a party #

11:03.540 --> 11:05.943
# Don't be a smarty #

11:06.480 --> 11:07.468
Go fuck yourself!

11:07.593 --> 11:08.581
Go fuck yourself!

Go fuck yourself!

Go fuck yourself!

Go fuck yourself!

Booyah!
