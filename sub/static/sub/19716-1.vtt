00:15.750 --> 00:17.282
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

00:17.284 --> 00:20.119
<i>What's your emergency, sir?</i>

00:22.256 --> 00:23.455
<i>Okay, what's the address?</i>

00:23.457 --> 00:25.657
<i>Sir, sir, what address?</i>

00:28.329 --> 00:29.728
<i>20 south brook road.</i>

00:29.730 --> 00:31.196
<i>I'm sending an ambulance
right now.</i>

00:31.198 --> 00:32.531
<i>Tell us what happened?</i>

00:49.983 --> 00:51.116
<i>Sir?</i>

01:04.931 --> 01:06.031
Ah.

01:09.936 --> 01:11.470
How do you work?

01:26.553 --> 01:30.089
Earthquake!

01:31.458 --> 01:33.759
Reaction shot.

01:33.761 --> 01:37.262
Farhang is going to kill me
when he sees your price tag.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.539
Look who's home.

01:48.575 --> 01:50.109
Hey, honey.

01:50.111 --> 01:52.878
Hi, how are you?

01:54.314 --> 01:55.747
Look what I got.

01:55.749 --> 01:56.915
- You bought that?
- Look what I got.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.183
Hold on a sec, wait, wait.
Say hello again.

01:58.185 --> 01:59.351
- Hello.
- Say it again.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.385
Hello, hello.

02:00.387 --> 02:01.487
Say it one more time.

02:01.489 --> 02:02.554
- Hey.
- My mic's working.

02:02.556 --> 02:03.956
That's a cool thing.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.357
- Isn't it beautiful?
- You got that today?

02:05.359 --> 02:05.357
I did.

02:05.359 --> 02:08.327
Do I just talk into the...
Can I come in?

02:08.329 --> 02:11.163
Yeah, come in, come in.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.498
The camera's not here.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.832
Just pretend
the camera's not here.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.994
- Pretend it's... okay.
- Yeah, pretend it's not there.

02:16.270 --> 02:16.268
Can I see it?

02:16.270 --> 02:18.437
- Yeah, you wanna see it?
- Yeah

02:18.439 --> 02:20.472
you gonna come get it?

02:20.474 --> 02:21.974
You're gonna fall
and you're going to break

02:21.976 --> 02:24.143
your brand new camera
that you just bought.

02:24.145 --> 02:25.277
No, no, no!
You're gonna break it.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.546
Don't wrestle for it!
What are you doing?

02:30.083 --> 02:31.517
Up in your grill.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.152
Whatcha doing?

02:33.154 --> 02:34.019
Reading.

02:34.021 --> 02:36.522
Show us some skin.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.857
Okay, okay, come on.

02:38.859 --> 02:42.294
Do you have to be
filming me reading?

02:42.296 --> 02:43.629
I'm filming everything.

02:43.631 --> 02:46.198
It's really weird having
that thing in my face.

02:46.200 --> 02:46.932
Really?

02:46.934 --> 02:48.133
You don't like it?

02:48.135 --> 02:49.935
You don't like having
it up in your face?

02:49.937 --> 02:51.637
Farhang, you're gonna break it.
No!

02:51.639 --> 02:53.238
How do you like it, huh?

02:53.240 --> 02:55.307
Do I look okay?

02:55.309 --> 02:57.042
You look great.

02:57.044 --> 02:58.010
Mm-hm?

02:58.012 --> 02:58.744
Yeah.

02:58.746 --> 02:59.444
Yeah.

02:59.446 --> 02:59.444
Mm-hm.

02:59.446 --> 03:03.382
Wow, you really like this
whole directorial role.

03:03.384 --> 03:06.485
Yeah. Oh my god, yes.
Yes I do.

03:06.487 --> 03:07.686
So we have to
film everything, right?

03:07.688 --> 03:08.487
Everything.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.389
- Mm-hm?
- Mm-hm.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.690
Hold on a sec, get a high angle.
Look.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.225
What do you think?

03:15.128 --> 03:17.329
I think I really
like this camera.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.096
Yeah?

03:18.098 --> 03:19.098
Yeah.

03:27.441 --> 03:30.242
Could you give me a massage?

03:30.910 --> 03:32.811
Yes, I can.

03:39.552 --> 03:40.552
Yeah.

03:42.121 --> 03:46.024
Here, let me put this down.

04:02.609 --> 04:03.709
Baby.

04:14.954 --> 04:15.887
Baby.

04:15.889 --> 04:16.922
Mm-hm.

04:18.190 --> 04:19.558
You asleep?

04:19.560 --> 04:20.659
Mm-hm.

04:29.502 --> 04:32.504
Welcome to blue balls,
the movie.

04:32.506 --> 04:36.475
A table saw, really?

04:36.477 --> 04:37.609
But it's more efficient, right?

04:37.611 --> 04:38.851
We don't have to use man power.

04:39.779 --> 04:43.148
- It's not wide enough.
- - Oh, to go... yeah, okay.

04:43.150 --> 04:45.751
Well there's a huge one there.

04:45.753 --> 04:46.918
Jesus.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.621
Look at the teeth on it.
Look at the teeth.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.889
I feel like I'm in a video game.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.691
- Pew pew pew.
- Okay.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.013
It's actually
not even that heavy.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.728
I could do this.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.398
Safety orange
seems a little ironic.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.367
What about this?
It's like a lobotomy.

05:02.369 --> 05:05.570
You have hold things
like not an insane person.

05:07.206 --> 05:08.466
Would this be enough?

05:09.742 --> 05:12.577
Do you think this would
work for like fingerprints?

05:12.579 --> 05:13.645
Bleach.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.447
We're going to have to
clean up the body

05:15.449 --> 05:17.683
and disinfect it and everything
anyways, so like...

05:17.685 --> 05:19.451
- Shh, baby.
- What? What?

05:19.453 --> 05:21.920
Oh, we need a caulking gun.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.488
A caulking gun?

05:23.490 --> 05:24.556
- Yes.
- What for?

05:25.091 --> 05:26.892
For the windows.
I just thought...

05:26.894 --> 05:28.293
For the windows?

05:28.295 --> 05:30.095
Yeah, in the den
and also in the...

05:30.097 --> 05:31.196
Okay, give me the camera.

05:31.864 --> 05:31.863
What?

05:31.865 --> 05:37.336
So what do we need next
that isn't a caulking gun?

05:37.338 --> 05:39.171
We need a tarp.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.372
Some caulking.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.007
Go, baby, go.

05:42.742 --> 05:44.276
So what's the next thing
we need?

05:45.878 --> 05:46.878
Uh...

05:48.014 --> 05:48.714
Hmm?

05:48.716 --> 05:49.881
Oh, here.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.484
Tarp, rags, stuff.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.052
We should probably
get some rags.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.555
Rat poison, would that
be enough do you think?

05:56.557 --> 05:58.190
Are you sure we should get two?

05:58.192 --> 05:58.190
Yes, we need two.

05:58.192 --> 06:01.393
Unless, do you want to
do all the digging?

06:01.395 --> 06:03.128
Do you want to do
all the digging?

06:03.896 --> 06:06.531
Yeah... okay.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.799
All right.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.302
Can I just take the camera
and you take the lead again?

06:10.304 --> 06:12.037
Yes, yes, babe.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.505
You know what?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.706
You did good.
You did really good.

06:14.708 --> 06:14.706
And you know what?

06:14.708 --> 06:18.377
We can get the caulking gun,
okay?

06:21.881 --> 06:23.548
Okay.

06:26.452 --> 06:27.919
- I like the weight.
- Yeah.

06:27.921 --> 06:30.422
Have you ever even
held an ax before?

06:31.424 --> 06:33.892
I think it looks like I have,
don't you?

06:33.894 --> 06:35.827
It might be
a little bit small maybe.

06:35.829 --> 06:40.298
- What's the size on this?
- Baby, put that down.

06:40.300 --> 06:40.298
Don't put it to your neck.

06:40.300 --> 06:44.369
I'm just playing around,
nobody's going to be, oh my god.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.411
Whatever, we're getting it

06:51.144 --> 06:53.078
Look who's studying.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.179
- Mm-hm.
- Hey, babe.

06:54.181 --> 06:54.179
Hey.

06:54.181 --> 06:58.183
So I understand the medical
books to a certain extent.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.418
I think it's overkill.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.853
But this print out...

07:01.855 --> 07:03.688
You'd be amazed
at the resources out there.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.690
So many people think about this.

07:05.692 --> 07:06.691
This is really fucked up.

07:06.693 --> 07:08.226
This is like
from the deep dark...

07:08.228 --> 07:09.428
Are you calling me fucked up

07:09.430 --> 07:10.562
because I'm doing my research?

07:10.564 --> 07:11.663
No, but this is fucked up.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.165
Pull out the teeth
and smash them.

07:13.167 --> 07:14.433
Babe, we need the information.

07:14.435 --> 07:15.867
We can't go into this
completely blind.

07:15.869 --> 07:15.867
What would you do?

07:15.869 --> 07:21.106
You can kill someone
with your bare hands.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.608
They make guns.

07:23.610 --> 07:27.179
If a gun is too noisy
then you can use a bat.

07:27.181 --> 07:28.914
- You hit them in the face.
- Also, blood everywhere.

07:28.916 --> 07:29.948
Just everywhere.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.450
It's really easy.

07:31.452 --> 07:33.452
You just, you kill them
with any of the ways

07:33.454 --> 07:35.153
that I just said
and then you chop them up

07:35.155 --> 07:37.122
and then you're done.
How would you?

07:37.124 --> 07:40.025
Okay, take the camera.
Sit down.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.159
I'm going to sit.

07:41.229 --> 07:42.128
Okay.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.996
We'd have to knock them out
first, obviously right?

07:44.998 --> 07:44.996
Okay.

07:44.998 --> 07:49.000
Something to make them sleep and then
I'd take them down to the basement

07:49.002 --> 07:51.503
because it's quiet
and there's no windows.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.438
You tie them up down
there while he's sleeping,

07:53.440 --> 07:56.274
but then you have to wait for
him to wake up first, right.

07:56.276 --> 07:57.576
This is key.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.212
I'd probably throttle him
somehow.

08:00.214 --> 08:02.113
Like take a rope
or a belt because

08:02.115 --> 08:05.417
it's quiet and it's quick and you
can really, like, feel them move.

08:05.419 --> 08:06.985
Like you feel them move.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.553
You can probably even hear
them fight for the breath.

08:08.555 --> 08:09.521
Oh, god.

08:09.523 --> 08:10.622
Okay.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.457
You can take them in the bathtub

08:12.459 --> 08:13.992
and you'd drain them out.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.328
So you'd probably start
by slitting his throat

08:16.330 --> 08:18.563
and let that bleed out
a little bit.

08:18.565 --> 08:21.166
After you drain them out,

08:21.168 --> 08:25.003
then you'd have to chop
them up into little pieces

08:25.005 --> 08:28.340
with a power saw.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.174
A quick one.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.141
Like a saber saw?

08:30.143 --> 08:31.376
Yes, whatever that is.

08:31.378 --> 08:33.211
Yeah, you have to chop them up.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.578
It would go right through
like butter,

08:34.581 --> 08:36.347
like something with some
serious power behind it.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.316
The hands, you have to get
rid of the fingerprints,

08:38.318 --> 08:40.952
so you could either
chop that up with razors

08:40.953 --> 08:43.188
or you could blow torch it,
melt it off.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.258
I think that's the most
efficient way to do it.

08:46.260 --> 08:47.526
Oh the head, the head,
the teeth,

08:47.528 --> 08:49.461
we'd have to get a pair
of pliers and rip

08:49.463 --> 08:51.496
the teeth out because
they can identify you

08:51.498 --> 08:52.797
from your dentals so you just.

08:52.799 --> 08:56.768
You would need to wrap the
pieces up individually, yeah?

08:56.770 --> 08:57.669
Mm-hm.

08:57.671 --> 09:00.772
And you put them
in garbage bags.

09:00.774 --> 09:01.907
And we would leave them
in the freezer,

09:01.909 --> 09:03.629
because you know,
we don't want it to stink.

09:04.343 --> 09:08.880
And then,
we put him in garbage bags,

09:08.882 --> 09:11.783
put him in the car,
take him out somewhere quiet

09:11.785 --> 09:14.286
and secluded, bury the pieces

09:16.188 --> 09:17.522
and he never comes back.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.392
What do you think?

09:25.298 --> 09:26.731
You know it could really
be anybody.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.768
How about those bros?
Let's go kill those bros.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.870
They're like that's hot, bro,

09:31.872 --> 09:33.204
let's like go get some slushies.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.439
Fuck some bitches.

09:34.441 --> 09:35.907
If I were to kill anybody,

09:35.909 --> 09:37.709
it would probably be my boss.

09:37.711 --> 09:42.180
Or the fucking it guy that
doesn't know how to say my name.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.915
The guy, what did he call you?

09:43.917 --> 09:46.284
- Uh, Jorge, that was it.
- Yeah.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.753
- Fucking Jorge. Let's kill Jorge.
- Way off!

09:48.755 --> 09:51.890
No, that's a little too close,
love, it has to be random.

09:51.892 --> 09:55.794
It can't be somebody
that either of us knows.

09:55.796 --> 09:56.661
Look at them.

09:56.663 --> 09:59.564
It's like a buffet.

09:59.566 --> 10:02.767
It's like pick you
lobster out of the tank.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.235
What about that girl
right there?

10:04.237 --> 10:05.470
No, she looks a bit young.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.606
I think it's pretty safe
to rule out kids.

10:07.608 --> 10:08.740
- Yeah.
- No children.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.475
I'm not a child killer.

10:10.477 --> 10:10.475
That's just fucked up.

10:10.477 --> 10:13.545
Yeah. I mean we could go
for teenagers

10:13.547 --> 10:14.980
because everybody
hates teenagers.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.381
There's gotta be at least
one person who would

10:16.383 --> 10:18.483
thank us for killing
any given teenager.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.885
But you never know,
they could always get better.

10:20.887 --> 10:23.622
I would rather
it not be a woman.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.522
Why not?

10:24.524 --> 10:24.522
If people find out,

10:24.524 --> 10:28.159
they're going to think
it's like some weird

10:28.161 --> 10:30.729
like rapey sex thing.

10:30.731 --> 10:33.898
Just because you kill a woman
doesn't mean you raped her.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.501
Tell that to
every other serial killer.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.470
They test a woman to
see if she was raped.

10:38.472 --> 10:42.140
Yeah, but they would immediately
assume that I was...

10:42.142 --> 10:44.943
Why would they assume that?
We're not going to get caught.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.645
You have completely the
wrong mentality with this.

10:46.647 --> 10:47.846
You're talking like
we're going to get caught

10:47.848 --> 10:49.280
and it'll be less bad
as opposed to

10:49.282 --> 10:50.915
if we do it properly
and never get caught at all.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.684
I'm just
talking in hypotheticals.

10:52.686 --> 10:52.684
I know.

10:52.686 --> 10:58.289
I would say no pregnant women
for sure.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.091
Maybe not old people.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.128
Like old within reason.
Let's say like...

11:03.130 --> 11:08.133
I don't know...
20 to 50.

11:08.135 --> 11:12.370
No handicaps, I think.
Nobody that's handicapped.

11:12.372 --> 11:16.474
I just want to be
completely sure

11:16.476 --> 11:20.311
that they are 100% aware
of what is going on

11:20.313 --> 11:22.447
and what's happening to them
as it happens, you know?

11:24.016 --> 11:24.716
Yeah.

11:24.718 --> 11:27.018
Yeah, they have to know.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.287
And I can't guarantee
that if it's someone

11:29.289 --> 11:30.488
that's mentally handicapped and

11:30.490 --> 11:32.023
that's not me
holding anything against

11:32.025 --> 11:36.194
that group,
it's just my not knowing.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.697
It defeats the purpose
of why I'm doing this,

11:38.699 --> 11:40.665
why we're doing this,
if we don't know.

11:40.667 --> 11:43.902
What about
physically handicapped?

11:43.904 --> 11:45.670
No. Really?

11:45.672 --> 11:47.739
Cripples?
What's wrong with you, farhang?

11:47.741 --> 11:49.974
Like, their life is bad enough.

11:49.976 --> 11:53.344
Well, I think we need to
establish some ground rules.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.346
And I think
we've established a few.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.315
All right, so what else
are your ground rules?

11:58.884 --> 12:01.119
Uh, no gay guys.

12:01.121 --> 12:01.886
What?

12:01.888 --> 12:03.054
Seriously?

12:03.056 --> 12:05.023
Farhang, I did not think
you were like that.

12:05.025 --> 12:09.427
No, what I'm saying
is not to kill anybody

12:09.429 --> 12:10.562
that's homosexual.

12:10.564 --> 12:11.930
Why would you think that?

12:11.932 --> 12:13.898
Because then
it looks like a hate crime.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.201
Nobody that's a minority.

12:16.203 --> 12:16.201
What?

12:16.203 --> 12:19.137
Because then again,
it's like a hate crime.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.672
Farhang, you're a minority.

12:21.008 --> 12:21.907
Yeah.

12:21.908 --> 12:27.712
You have been homophobic,
racist and sexist.

12:27.714 --> 12:30.715
By saying that I don't
want to kill gay people

12:30.717 --> 12:32.250
minorities and women?

12:32.252 --> 12:34.185
I think it should be
equal murder opportunity

12:34.187 --> 12:35.153
for everyone.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.255
I'm giving them
life opportunities.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.290
Just live and flourish.

12:41.994 --> 12:43.261
Farhang, I need your help
with something.

12:43.263 --> 12:43.261
Mm-hm?

12:43.263 --> 12:45.363
I need your help.
Can you come with me please?

12:45.365 --> 12:45.363
Is everything okay?

12:45.365 --> 12:48.433
Yes, yes, there's
just a thing in the basement,

12:48.435 --> 12:51.169
it's not fitting
and I need assistance.

12:51.171 --> 12:51.169
- Come, come, come.
- Can it wait?

12:51.171 --> 12:53.805
No, it can't.
Come, it's gotta be now.

12:53.807 --> 12:55.807
- Okay.
- We're going, come on.

12:56.742 --> 12:56.741
Into the bathroom?

12:56.743 --> 12:58.710
Yes, into the bathroom.

13:00.312 --> 13:01.312
Come here.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.482
I don't think it's big enough.

13:04.484 --> 13:05.917
- Seriously.
- Big enough for what?

13:05.919 --> 13:08.153
It's not going to
fit a whole body in there.

13:08.155 --> 13:11.689
Bathtubs are made
to fit a whole body.

13:11.691 --> 13:13.591
That's like the whole
purpose of a bathtub.

13:13.593 --> 13:14.492
Get in the tub?

13:14.494 --> 13:15.426
Yeah, yeah.

13:15.428 --> 13:16.561
It might be wet.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.663
No, lie down.
Lie down, lie down.

13:18.665 --> 13:19.430
Lie down?

13:19.432 --> 13:20.365
Yeah, lie down.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.000
We need to see if you fit.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.434
It's totally wet.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.803
Quit your bitching.

13:24.805 --> 13:25.804
My socks are going to be wet.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.705
Lie down, like a body.

13:27.707 --> 13:28.873
Like a dead body?

13:28.875 --> 13:29.974
Yeah, like a dead body.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.477
If he's bigger, look, okay,

13:33.112 --> 13:34.179
here give me the camera.

13:36.115 --> 13:38.349
Babe, I think we might need
to buy another tub.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.450
No, no, come here.

13:39.452 --> 13:40.452
Get on your knees.

13:40.953 --> 13:42.287
Seriously?

13:42.289 --> 13:44.255
Just get on your knees.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.323
You want me to get down
on my knees?

13:45.325 --> 13:46.325
Yes.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.627
Okay. So, check it out.

13:49.629 --> 13:52.730
So we drain body
part by body part.

13:52.732 --> 13:53.464
All right?

13:53.466 --> 13:54.486
Give me your arm.

13:55.100 --> 13:59.938
We take the forearm and
we make an incision up...

13:59.940 --> 14:04.209
along like the major arteries
and we drain it into the tub.

14:04.211 --> 14:07.212
Then we grab the neck...

14:11.717 --> 14:15.153
Then we can drain it
in this way, yeah?

14:15.988 --> 14:17.388
- Yeah.
- Right?

14:18.424 --> 14:21.559
And then, here...

14:21.561 --> 14:27.532
So put the other arm up and
then we drain that arm, okay?

14:27.534 --> 14:27.532
Yeah.

14:27.534 --> 14:33.304
And then we can cut
along the sides

14:34.306 --> 14:38.243
along the major arteries,
where the organs are.

14:40.679 --> 14:41.679
Yeah.

14:43.682 --> 14:46.017
I have to fuck.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.219
Fuck.

15:00.766 --> 15:02.033
Bend over.

15:37.336 --> 15:38.670
Oh, these are dirty.

15:39.538 --> 15:41.806
Where did all the squirrels go?

15:42.775 --> 15:44.409
Nice camera.

15:44.411 --> 15:47.145
Oh, thanks.
How's it going, man?

15:47.147 --> 15:48.146
Pretty good.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.348
Is it okay if I film you?

15:50.350 --> 15:52.483
Yeah, sure, are you a
photographer or something?

15:52.485 --> 15:55.186
Budding director, I think.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.287
Budding director, eh?

15:56.289 --> 15:57.021
What's your name?

15:57.023 --> 15:59.123
Oh, Gary.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.658
- I'm Jen.
- Jen.

16:00.660 --> 16:01.426
Nice to meet you.

16:01.428 --> 16:02.460
Jen the director.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.129
Where do I fit
into this movie of yours?

16:05.131 --> 16:06.564
- I'm not sure yet.
- Need a hero?

16:06.566 --> 16:07.432
What?

16:07.434 --> 16:08.466
Need a hero?

16:08.468 --> 16:09.334
I do.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.869
With me as your lead, you know,

16:11.871 --> 16:14.672
I'm willing to go
anywhere and do anything.

16:14.674 --> 16:20.044
You don't have to pay
me millions of dollars.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.946
So less of an investment.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.282
Got an open schedule.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.517
Ah, you're really
selling me on this, Gary.

16:26.519 --> 16:26.517
You look like a star.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.320
If you're going
to be a big star, Gary,

16:29.322 --> 16:30.521
I need to get
a full shot of you.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.056
- Come here.
- Uh, sure.

16:32.058 --> 16:32.824
Can I stand you up?

16:32.826 --> 16:33.992
My god, you are tall.

16:33.994 --> 16:34.959
Look at you.

16:34.961 --> 16:35.927
Work that camera.

16:35.929 --> 16:36.929
You look fantastic.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.964
Pose it-
oh, sorry, man.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.166
Oh, you've got to be
fucking kidding me.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.301
- Sorry.
- Unbelievable.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.469
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.037
Are you okay?

16:46.039 --> 16:46.804
Come on. Fuck.

16:46.806 --> 16:49.307
Just... watch it will you?

16:49.309 --> 16:51.009
If you weren't backing up.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.543
She didn't mean nothing by it.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.012
Buddy, look, just hands off,
okay?

16:54.014 --> 16:54.012
I got nothing for you.

16:54.014 --> 16:57.248
Hey, he was just
trying to help me, man. Relax.

16:57.250 --> 17:00.151
Look, if you didn't back up and
bump into me... is that thing on?

17:00.153 --> 17:01.119
Get it out of my face.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.120
Okay, it's off.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.121
I'm filming Gary.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.156
Fine, keep filming Gary.

17:05.157 --> 17:06.324
He's more interesting anyway.

17:06.326 --> 17:07.025
Fucking bitch.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.027
Excuse me?

17:08.993 --> 17:11.462
I'm sorry, can I get that one
more time on camera, please?

17:11.464 --> 17:11.462
What was that?

17:11.464 --> 17:14.699
Look, I already told you,
get that out of my face.

17:14.701 --> 17:15.599
Back off.

17:15.602 --> 17:15.599
I am backed off.
I'm nowhere near you.

17:15.602 --> 17:15.599
Shut it off, shut it off.

17:15.602 --> 17:15.599
No, I don't.
I don't have to shut it off.

17:15.602 --> 17:21.305
What are you gonna do about it?
- This is un-fucking-believable.

17:21.307 --> 17:23.741
Get that shit out of my face
and take off.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.609
Touch my fucking camera
and I will kill you.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.744
- Oh, really?
- You know what? This is perfect,

17:27.747 --> 17:29.380
'cause my movie needs
a fucking villain,

17:29.382 --> 17:29.380
you piece of shit.
- Oh, you're filming a movie.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.583
You're going to be a famous
director or something, right?

17:32.585 --> 17:34.619
Great, great.
- You know what, buddy...

17:34.621 --> 17:36.054
Good luck with that.
Good luck with that.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.655
- You'll get yours!
- Yeah.

17:37.657 --> 17:38.923
Keep walking!

17:38.925 --> 17:40.158
Yeah, see ya, you slut.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.526
Bye!

17:42.027 --> 17:44.262
Fuckin'...

17:44.264 --> 17:47.331
You... are a piece of work.

17:50.302 --> 17:52.336
Can you believe that guy, Gary?

17:53.872 --> 17:55.406
Can't all be winners.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.674
- You know what?
- Huh?

17:56.676 --> 17:57.975
Here.

17:58.544 --> 17:59.610
- You sure?
- Yeah.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.446
Grab something warm
for dinner tonight.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.081
Jen, the director, right?

18:03.083 --> 18:04.749
All right, well...

18:04.751 --> 18:06.751
- Gary, my star.
- God bless, eh?

18:06.753 --> 18:08.486
Yeah, take care, man.

18:14.360 --> 18:15.993
Yes! Oh, god.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.727
And thus exitus our villain.

18:53.665 --> 18:55.433
How the other half lives.

18:59.605 --> 19:03.307
Shit, there's a Mrs. douchebag.

19:04.611 --> 19:07.044
What kind of woman
marries a guy like that?

19:07.046 --> 19:08.613
Fuckin' cunt.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.485
Hey! Farhang!

19:14.487 --> 19:15.686
Hello! Farhang?

19:16.923 --> 19:18.556
What?

19:18.558 --> 19:20.791
Farhang, for god's sake.

19:22.794 --> 19:24.529
Hi!
- Hey!

19:24.531 --> 19:26.130
- Hi.
- How you doin'?

19:26.132 --> 19:26.998
Not...

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Why is there meat...
- what?

19:29.002 --> 19:31.302
Why is there meat
in the bathtub?

19:31.304 --> 19:34.805
You know, I figured if we're going
to do the body in here, right?

19:34.807 --> 19:36.807
So this way we can practice...

19:36.809 --> 19:38.442
and, you know,
work out all the logistics.

19:38.444 --> 19:40.244
- Practice. Okay.
- This thing is amazing.

19:40.246 --> 19:43.581
How was your day?

19:43.583 --> 19:44.949
Can you turn that off, please?

19:44.951 --> 19:46.684
Yeah, sure.
What's up?

19:46.686 --> 19:48.052
I just got fucking yelled at

19:48.054 --> 19:50.087
by this asshole in the street.

19:50.089 --> 19:50.087
Jesus!

19:50.089 --> 19:52.823
Yeah, I was filming
this really nice guy

19:52.825 --> 19:54.091
and I accidentally
backed into him.

19:54.093 --> 19:56.627
He called me, like...
He called me a fucking cunt.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.296
- What?
- Yeah, I know!

19:58.298 --> 19:59.964
Don't worry.
We'll just-we'll cut him up

19:59.966 --> 20:02.833
with this awesome new saber saw
that I just got.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.502
Huh? Huh?

20:04.504 --> 20:07.572
- I see-i see the new...
- 42% off!

20:07.574 --> 20:09.840
I found a knick on the box.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.242
You wouldn't even
believe this guy.

20:11.244 --> 20:13.411
Nobody would miss him,
he's just such a piece of shit.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.645
You know.
- Yeah?

20:14.647 --> 20:15.813
Yeah, man, it's just like...

20:15.815 --> 20:17.415
He just wouldn't leave it alone.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.017
Sounds like an asshole!

20:22.020 --> 20:24.522
- Hey, babe.
- Got the tarp...

20:24.524 --> 20:27.024
and I also got a surprise.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.960
Sweet! Sweet.

20:28.962 --> 20:30.228
Shall we, uh, roll it out?

20:30.230 --> 20:32.797
- Sure.
- Cool, okay.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.865
Document the whole process.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.801
Just, like, right here?

20:36.803 --> 20:38.169
Here, just roll it my way.

20:42.708 --> 20:44.041
Perfect.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.376
This really folds out well, eh?

20:45.378 --> 20:46.510
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.079
Why do we need a tarp?

20:49.047 --> 20:52.450
Well, 'cause bodies
are messy, love.

20:52.452 --> 20:55.553
Yeah, but I thought we were going
to, like, minimize the spillage.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.188
Yeah, but I mean,
for safety's sake.

20:57.190 --> 20:58.756
You don't want DNA
on the floor, you know, like,

20:58.758 --> 21:00.625
they can find
that shit even if you clean it,

21:00.627 --> 21:02.660
and dead bodies shit, obviously.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.262
- Ew!
- So, yeah.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.830
Yeah, and I don't...
Yeah.

21:05.832 --> 21:08.165
- For real? Like, actually?
- Yeah.

21:09.234 --> 21:11.135
So what was the other thing
you got?

21:11.137 --> 21:13.838
Oh, I got...

21:15.340 --> 21:17.642
some handcuffs so we can...

21:17.644 --> 21:19.210
restrain the body.

21:23.382 --> 21:26.951
These are a little light, babe.
Where'd you...

21:26.953 --> 21:29.287
- Hm?
- They're a little light.

21:29.289 --> 21:31.222
I got-i got them
from the sex shop.

21:31.224 --> 21:33.924
You got them
from a fucking sex shop?

21:33.926 --> 21:36.427
Farhang, these are designed
to be able to get out of.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.296
I can get out of these
in like five seconds.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.497
Yeah, they're in front
of you, though.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.766
If they were behind your back,
you wouldn't...

21:41.768 --> 21:43.968
be able to see how they work.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.336
Right you are.

21:45.338 --> 21:46.637
Let's test that theory,
shall we?

21:46.639 --> 21:48.172
Can I have the camera, please?

21:52.110 --> 21:56.881
You're very right.
They were in front of my body.

21:56.883 --> 22:01.252
So if you put them... behind.
- Ooh, ah, fuck!

22:01.254 --> 22:03.120
Baby Jesus!
- How's that work?

22:03.122 --> 22:04.455
Are they tight enough?
Tight?

22:04.457 --> 22:05.856
- That's really fuckin' tight.
- Yeah?

22:05.858 --> 22:07.725
Down you go. Down.
- Ah!

22:08.360 --> 22:10.094
Jesus!

22:10.096 --> 22:12.196
Baby, that actually
really fuckin' hurts!

22:12.198 --> 22:13.731
- Yeah?
- Yes.

22:13.733 --> 22:16.434
- All right, better?
- Ah!

22:16.436 --> 22:18.135
- Hmm?
- Fuck.

22:18.137 --> 22:19.837
Over you go!

22:21.474 --> 22:22.773
Does it hurt to lie on them?

22:22.775 --> 22:24.175
They're behind your back, though.
- Yeah.

22:24.177 --> 22:25.643
- Can you get out of 'em?
- No, I can't.

22:25.645 --> 22:27.845
- No, you can't get out of 'em?
- Please. Please.

22:27.847 --> 22:27.845
Please, baby.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.781
What? They're not supposed
to be comfortable.

22:30.783 --> 22:32.717
Please, just...
Please, can you just...

22:32.719 --> 22:34.051
Get out of them!

22:34.053 --> 22:35.319
Okay, just get out of them.

22:35.321 --> 22:36.854
You've proved your point.
They really fuckin' hurt.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.422
Can you just get them
off me, please?

22:38.424 --> 22:39.824
- Roll over.
- Fuck.

22:40.926 --> 22:42.493
I'm going to leave you alone
with my camera

22:42.495 --> 22:44.061
and these handcuffs
and whenever you're out of them

22:44.063 --> 22:45.529
you can come up.

22:45.531 --> 22:47.765
Turn it off
when you're done, please.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.265
Fuck!

23:26.105 --> 23:27.271
Fuck.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.646
Oh, my god.

24:10.248 --> 24:11.315
Hi, guys!

24:11.317 --> 24:12.650
Hey, mommy.
How are you?

24:12.652 --> 24:13.984
Good!

24:13.986 --> 24:15.219
- Hey, mom.
- Hi!

24:15.221 --> 24:16.287
- How's it going?
- How are you?

24:16.289 --> 24:18.055
I can't-i can't...

24:19.058 --> 24:20.991
How's it going?
What's new?

24:20.993 --> 24:22.593
Oh, not much.

24:22.595 --> 24:23.961
Sit with mommy.

24:23.963 --> 24:24.963
Ugh!

24:25.664 --> 24:27.465
It's good to see ya!
- Nice to see you, too.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.868
We're making a movie.
- What's with this?

24:30.870 --> 24:33.037
- It's new.
- Well, why did you buy that?

24:33.039 --> 24:34.738
There's one downstairs
you could have had.

24:34.740 --> 24:37.208
That one is new and shiny,
but...

24:37.210 --> 24:38.843
Oh, like, the old one.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.244
Do you still have
any of the tapes?

24:40.246 --> 24:40.244
Oh, my god.

24:40.246 --> 24:42.480
I wonder what's down there.
I wanna go...

24:42.482 --> 24:44.348
Can I go through the box
at some point?

24:44.350 --> 24:45.783
- Sure. - I wanna go through the
box and see what's in there.

24:45.785 --> 24:48.486
Okay, why are you filming this?

24:48.488 --> 24:50.354
We're sort of documenting
everything, actually.

24:50.356 --> 24:52.356
We took it-we took it
to the hardware store with us,

24:52.358 --> 24:53.591
I take it out on walks,

24:53.593 --> 24:55.025
I've taken it driving.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.027
- Documentary?
- Yeah, exactly.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.596
A documentary.
- Uh-huh.

24:58.598 --> 25:00.498
Do you-do you still have
those tapes

25:00.500 --> 25:02.800
that she would-she would make
when she was younger?

25:02.802 --> 25:04.335
I've got some of 'em. Yeah.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.437
Yeah? I'd love to see...

25:06.439 --> 25:08.372
Like, what kind of stuff
did she film?

25:08.374 --> 25:10.040
What did she...

25:13.912 --> 25:15.312
What did she film?

25:19.317 --> 25:21.085
Stuff like what
you're doing now.

25:21.087 --> 25:23.921
Sticking a camera in everybody's
face and bugging them.

25:23.923 --> 25:26.090
Yeah.

25:26.092 --> 25:29.527
There's this one time, like,
when I was a little kid.

25:29.529 --> 25:31.495
I didn't believe that cats
always landed on their feet.

25:31.497 --> 25:33.297
And I might have filmed this. It
might be on one of the tapes.

25:33.299 --> 25:33.297
Oh, my god.

25:33.299 --> 25:36.634
Where I didn't believe that
cats always land on their feet,

25:36.636 --> 25:38.469
so I took Toto up
to the top of the stairs

25:38.471 --> 25:41.238
and held him, like, on his back
and dropped him.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.908
Like, not down the stairs,
like, down on the landing

25:43.910 --> 25:46.076
to see if he would land on his feet,
and I might have filmed that.

25:46.078 --> 25:46.076
You might have filmed that.

25:46.078 --> 25:50.314
Sarah got really mad when I did it
to the other-to her cat, though.

25:50.316 --> 25:51.949
- I'll bet she was.
- He was fine.

25:51.951 --> 25:53.884
Nothing happened.
He didn't die or anything.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.719
But he did land on his feet.

25:56.521 --> 25:58.355
They do, they twist
very quickly.

25:58.357 --> 26:01.825
Although you do hit... there is
a terminal velocity of cats.

26:01.827 --> 26:01.825
They found this out in New York

26:01.827 --> 26:06.430
from, like, statistics of cats
falling out of high rises.

26:06.432 --> 26:09.400
Below something, like,
the sixth or the seventh floor,

26:09.402 --> 26:11.869
they can-they turn
and they can land.

26:11.871 --> 26:14.705
From, like, the sixth to, like,
the 15th floor, they die,

26:14.707 --> 26:16.874
and above that, they usually-
they land on their feet,

26:16.876 --> 26:18.709
and if they don't, like,
break all of their legs,

26:18.711 --> 26:19.810
they actually hit
a terminal velocity,

26:19.812 --> 26:21.579
can figure
how fast they're going

26:21.581 --> 26:23.013
and right themselves
so they can land.

26:23.015 --> 26:23.013
Wow.

26:23.015 --> 26:26.417
So, like, if you live in an
apartment building between s-

26:26.419 --> 26:28.786
like, on the floor between six
and 15, your cats are goners,

26:28.788 --> 26:30.788
but if you're below or above,
you're good.

26:35.061 --> 26:36.527
Hi, Jen.

26:36.529 --> 26:39.263
Jennifer Leigh.
Hi.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.999
Say something intelligent,
Jennifer.

26:54.513 --> 26:56.480
Okay, she most certainly has.

26:59.919 --> 27:02.886
Meh-meh-meh-meh-meh-meh!

27:03.622 --> 27:05.022
Yum, yum.

27:06.424 --> 27:07.691
Yum!

27:12.831 --> 27:14.331
Hello.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.900
Welcome to the future.

27:18.269 --> 27:20.771
Space technology...

27:20.773 --> 27:22.439
has allowed us...

27:23.675 --> 27:26.477
to voyage beyond our star.

27:26.479 --> 27:28.012
This is so cool.

27:28.813 --> 27:30.514
This is amazing.

27:31.683 --> 27:33.817
Oh, it sucks.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.953
This thing weighs like...

27:35.955 --> 27:39.456
It's like two dead babies...
In weight.

27:39.458 --> 27:42.793
This camera
is the coolest horrible thing.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.194
It's-it's huge.

27:44.196 --> 27:46.463
Yeah, it's amazing.

27:46.465 --> 27:48.365
What are you doin'?

27:48.367 --> 27:51.635
Nothing, just going through
some old movies I...

27:51.637 --> 27:53.270
I made.

27:54.707 --> 27:56.840
I don't even remember this one.

27:56.842 --> 27:57.875
You made all of these?

27:57.877 --> 27:59.276
Most of them, yeah.

27:59.278 --> 28:01.879
I mean some of them are just-
are, like, film off-

28:01.881 --> 28:04.081
like, filmed movies
off TV, but...

28:04.083 --> 28:06.350
most of them are mine.

28:06.352 --> 28:07.451
That's awesome.

28:07.453 --> 28:08.819
This is what I wanted
to do with my life.

28:08.821 --> 28:10.421
I wanted to make movies.

28:11.256 --> 28:13.190
But we're making this one now,
right?

28:13.192 --> 28:15.225
So, it's okay.

28:15.227 --> 28:18.896
Come on, let's go for a walk,
film some stuff.

28:18.898 --> 28:21.165
I'm bringing this camera.

28:21.167 --> 28:23.400
You know what? Fine.
We can take it with us,

28:23.402 --> 28:25.636
as long as you don't
forget the real camera.

28:25.638 --> 28:26.737
And you can play
with that piece of crap

28:26.739 --> 28:30.140
while I continue with...
Our movie.

28:30.142 --> 28:31.675
- Perfect.
- Yep.

28:31.677 --> 28:33.644
I'll shoot a better movie
with this.

28:33.646 --> 28:35.927
Those can stay there and never
see the light of day again.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.185
I don't...

28:41.187 --> 28:45.089
I just don't get why,
like, this guy specifically.

28:45.091 --> 28:47.324
Like, why do we have to
follow this guy?

28:47.326 --> 28:50.761
Well, for one,
he called me a cunt.

28:50.763 --> 28:52.162
Thanks for the loyalty.

28:53.198 --> 28:55.265
Well yeah, but is that
a reason to kill somebody?

28:55.267 --> 28:56.700
Like, if somebody
called me an asshole,

28:56.702 --> 28:58.268
you would kill them?
- Yes!

28:58.270 --> 29:00.504
Hell yes, I would. Yeah!
- Are you kidding me?

29:00.506 --> 29:02.072
Can we just write him off
as an asshole

29:02.074 --> 29:03.574
and then go home?

29:03.576 --> 29:04.975
Tandem bike.

29:05.777 --> 29:07.578
You know what sucks
about stakeouts?

29:07.580 --> 29:08.580
Hmm?

29:09.047 --> 29:12.583
The whole... stake out part.

29:12.585 --> 29:14.585
It seems so much shorter
in movies,

29:14.587 --> 29:16.019
but they're always tired,
and I guess-

29:16.021 --> 29:17.554
It's because
they cut it together.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.656
They only keep
the interesting bits, love.

29:19.658 --> 29:21.725
In our movie, like,
when this is all done

29:21.727 --> 29:24.294
and we're making up our movie
and putting it together, like,

29:24.296 --> 29:26.130
this stuff-
this isn't going to be in it.

29:26.132 --> 29:28.599
There's only going to be
the interesting parts.

29:28.601 --> 29:30.334
Like, what you're... this bullshit
that you're saying right now,

29:30.336 --> 29:33.403
thank god, will never
see the light of day.

29:33.405 --> 29:35.539
I don't think what I say
is bullshit.

29:35.541 --> 29:37.141
What if he has guests?

29:37.143 --> 29:39.843
And we're just...
Outside his house.

29:39.845 --> 29:42.479
They just come out like,
"okay, bye."

29:42.481 --> 29:43.981
Thanks for having us.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.716
"Whoa, what are
these strangers doing?"

29:45.718 --> 29:47.050
Wait, shh. Look, look, look.

29:47.052 --> 29:48.819
Farhang, look, look.
There he is.

29:48.821 --> 29:49.920
Oh, shit.

29:49.922 --> 29:52.222
Oh! Are they fighting?

29:52.224 --> 29:54.191
Doesn't he look
like a complete asshole?

29:55.660 --> 29:56.994
Farhang, I want you
to follow him.

29:56.996 --> 29:58.829
- What?
- Follow him!

29:58.831 --> 30:00.330
Baby... oh, my god.

30:00.332 --> 30:02.432
- Go, go, go. Drive, go, drive!
- Are you kidding me?

30:02.434 --> 30:04.701
- Farhang, drive! Go, please!
- Seriously?

30:04.703 --> 30:06.036
We're gonna lose him!

30:06.038 --> 30:07.738
It's exciting now, isn't it?

30:07.740 --> 30:10.007
It's way more illegal.
I don't know why we're follow...

30:10.009 --> 30:11.742
Where are we going?
- We're following him.

30:11.744 --> 30:13.110
We don't know where we're going.

30:13.112 --> 30:14.278
We're going where he's going.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.847
I just wanna know
more about him.

30:16.849 --> 30:18.715
Like, who is this person?

30:18.717 --> 30:18.715
What kind of life do they lead?

30:18.717 --> 30:22.986
Aren't you not supposed to,
like, make it person?

30:22.988 --> 30:24.555
Like, the less you know...

30:25.290 --> 30:27.391
Maybe, but I'm curious.

30:27.393 --> 30:29.960
And this guy's a piece of shit, I
want to see how deep that goes.

30:35.033 --> 30:36.366
He's stopping!

30:36.368 --> 30:38.402
Uh... what should I do?
What should I do?

30:38.404 --> 30:40.938
Just go ahead, drive ahead.
Drive ahead, drive ahead.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.472
- He's gonna see us.
- No he's not.

30:42.474 --> 30:45.709
He's not even looking.
Pull up here.

30:49.347 --> 30:50.881
Where is he going?

30:50.883 --> 30:55.118
This is not your house, mister.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.321
Could be anybody's house.

30:57.323 --> 30:58.655
Visiting a friend.

30:58.657 --> 31:00.090
I don't think
this guy has friends.

31:00.092 --> 31:03.927
Look at her.

31:09.601 --> 31:12.002
Yeah, farhang,
he's visiting a friend.

31:12.004 --> 31:16.139
He fucking called me a slut,
he has a fucking slut.

31:16.141 --> 31:18.108
We should get out of here.
Like, this is not...

31:18.110 --> 31:21.178
Love, come on,
he has a mistress.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.846
It couldn't get any better.

31:22.848 --> 31:25.282
That's not any of our business.
We could, like...

31:25.284 --> 31:26.884
I don't give a fuck
about this guy.

31:26.886 --> 31:28.986
I don't care what he does.
We should get out of here.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.320
He's going to fucking
look at us.

31:30.322 --> 31:33.423
Okay, okay, all right, go.
Let's go.

31:33.425 --> 31:37.427
Bye, bye, asshole!
We'll be back.

31:38.363 --> 31:42.432
Oh, god, he's perfect!
He's perfect!

31:42.434 --> 31:45.335
So, I think we've got
everything that we need, right?

31:45.337 --> 31:46.637
We know where he lives,

31:46.639 --> 31:48.138
and we know what his routine is,

31:48.140 --> 31:51.074
and-and, oh,
if he goes missing,

31:51.076 --> 31:52.809
there's-there's motive.

31:53.678 --> 31:57.080
Oh god, this could not
get any better!

31:57.082 --> 31:58.448
I'm so glad,

31:58.450 --> 32:01.318
mcdouche turned out to be
what I thought he was.

32:01.320 --> 32:02.552
I just-i don't know.

32:03.855 --> 32:05.689
He's perfect.

32:05.691 --> 32:07.457
Jen, you're making this
so personal.

32:07.459 --> 32:09.259
- No, I'm not.
- You said...

32:09.261 --> 32:11.862
that it should not be personal
because that's traceable

32:11.864 --> 32:13.263
and now you're
making it personal.

32:13.265 --> 32:13.263
No, I'm not making it personal,

32:13.265 --> 32:16.967
I'm pointing out what an
obvious piece of shit he is.

32:16.969 --> 32:19.069
I'm not debating whether
or not he's an asshole.

32:19.071 --> 32:20.404
You're just making it personal

32:20.406 --> 32:22.439
by observing
his asshole behavior

32:22.441 --> 32:24.007
and having an opinion about it.

32:25.377 --> 32:27.210
You know what?
Fine, fine.

32:27.212 --> 32:28.946
If we kill somebody else,
it's fuckin' on you.

32:28.948 --> 32:30.280
It's on you.

32:41.993 --> 32:43.393
Farhang, wake up.

32:44.095 --> 32:45.562
Farhang, wake up.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.465
Hello, wake up!

32:48.467 --> 32:49.766
What's wrong?
You okay?

32:49.768 --> 32:51.101
- Good. You're awake.
- Ow.

32:51.103 --> 32:51.101
- Yes, we're awake?
- What's going on?

32:51.103 --> 32:53.637
- Are you listening?
- Are you filming right now?

32:53.639 --> 32:54.771
Yes, I'm filming.

32:54.773 --> 32:56.873
When is this gonna happen?

32:56.875 --> 32:58.475
Soon, baby, soon.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.744
- Keep your eyes open. Look at me.
- Okay, okay, okay.

33:00.746 --> 33:02.879
- Are you serious about this?
- Yes, I'm serious about this.

33:02.881 --> 33:04.281
- Do you promise?
- Yes, I am.

33:04.283 --> 33:05.916
It's just not the time
to talk right now.

33:05.918 --> 33:08.752
No, now is exactly the time.
Okay? No we're...

33:08.754 --> 33:10.587
Get out of bed.
I gotta show you something.

33:10.589 --> 33:12.289
Get out, get out,
get out of bed.

33:12.291 --> 33:13.523
Go! Get out of bed!

33:13.525 --> 33:15.258
You think I'm joking?! Go!

33:15.260 --> 33:17.127
Get out of bed! Go!

33:18.296 --> 33:20.230
So, what're we-
what are we doing?

33:20.232 --> 33:21.531
Where are we going?

33:21.533 --> 33:23.000
Shh. Keep your voice down.

33:23.002 --> 33:24.768
We're here.

33:25.803 --> 33:28.138
I know you live
around here somewhere.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.473
I know he's around here.

33:29.475 --> 33:30.640
Can we just do this tomorrow?

33:30.642 --> 33:32.476
Which house is your house?

33:32.478 --> 33:34.978
Come on, come on.
- I don't know what I'm coming on to.

33:34.980 --> 33:37.014
What're we doing?

33:37.016 --> 33:38.515
Can you tell me what's going on?

33:38.517 --> 33:40.183
No, you'll know him
when you see him.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.385
You'll see.

33:41.387 --> 33:44.121
Babe, I think I saw him.
I think he's down there.

33:44.123 --> 33:46.156
I found you.
Come on, buddy.

33:46.158 --> 33:48.325
I know he's back here.
- Okay, baby, baby...

33:48.327 --> 33:49.760
Shh. Shh. Come on.

33:49.762 --> 33:50.994
We're gonna get caught.

33:50.996 --> 33:52.729
We're not gonna get caught.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.197
Shh, shh, shh.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.033
I know he's back here somewhere.

33:56.035 --> 33:58.568
Go on, go on.

33:58.570 --> 33:59.736
Shh.

34:00.705 --> 34:02.906
It's just a motion sensor.
Calm down.

34:02.908 --> 34:06.009
He's around here.

34:06.011 --> 34:07.577
I saw him, I saw him,
I saw him, I see him,

34:07.579 --> 34:11.081
farhang, take the camera.
Take it, take it, take it.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.649
Come here, kitty.

34:14.819 --> 34:16.353
Come here.

34:17.621 --> 34:19.688
Baby.

34:19.690 --> 34:20.690
Got you.

34:24.562 --> 34:26.362
Okay, what the fuck?

34:26.364 --> 34:28.931
Have you seen my friend?

34:28.934 --> 34:30.467
Hello, buddy.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.237
Okay, what the fuck?

34:34.239 --> 34:35.938
Okay, okay, baby, we gotta-

34:36.873 --> 34:38.275
okay, okay, let's go.

34:38.277 --> 34:40.342
Can you put him back please?

34:40.344 --> 34:42.612
What the fuck?
- Come on, baby.

34:43.514 --> 34:45.215
Isn't he sweet?

34:45.917 --> 34:48.284
You are just the cutest.

34:49.853 --> 34:52.289
Come on.
- Baby, okay...

34:52.291 --> 34:55.358
I think we should-i think we
should take the cat back, baby.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.394
No, the cat's not coming back.

34:57.396 --> 34:59.129
Kitty's gonna go
for a little swim.

34:59.131 --> 35:02.833
Um... what's that
supposed to mean?

35:05.069 --> 35:07.204
Could you do me a favor
and fill up the sink, please?

35:08.339 --> 35:10.173
Baby... can...

35:11.008 --> 35:12.943
Can we please
take the cat back now?

35:12.945 --> 35:14.311
I don't want to be a catnapper.

35:14.313 --> 35:16.246
He's just a cat.

35:16.248 --> 35:17.380
You're just a cat.

35:17.382 --> 35:18.982
Yeah, someone else's cat.

35:18.984 --> 35:22.018
They're going to be concerned when
they notice that their cat is gone.

35:22.020 --> 35:23.553
Farhang,
it's just a fucking cat.

35:23.555 --> 35:24.788
If you can't do this with a cat,

35:24.790 --> 35:26.456
how are you gonna do it
with a person?

35:26.458 --> 35:29.426
Could you please do me a favor
and fill up the sink?

35:30.962 --> 35:33.830
Yes, we're gonna...
Do you like water?

35:33.832 --> 35:35.799
Oh my god, fuck.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.767
We'll name you Davy Jones.

35:41.506 --> 35:44.074
Oh, look how sweet he is.

35:44.076 --> 35:45.342
Baby.

35:45.344 --> 35:46.743
- Ooh.
- Baby.

35:47.612 --> 35:49.513
Listen, you've proved
your point, okay?

35:49.515 --> 35:51.248
Just... just...

35:51.250 --> 35:53.383
Relax, farhang,
it's not even a big deal.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.452
It's not even a big deal.

35:57.156 --> 35:58.555
Bye-bye.
- Baby.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.157
The kitty is saying goodbye.

36:00.159 --> 36:02.125
Look, look, he likes it.
He's looking right at it.

36:02.127 --> 36:05.762
Jen, Jen, please, Jen.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.097
Babe, could you do me a favor
and get me a bag?

36:07.099 --> 36:09.633
Please? Like a garbage bag?
Something plastic.

36:09.635 --> 36:11.067
Are you...

36:11.836 --> 36:13.470
Are you serious?
Can we...

36:13.472 --> 36:15.639
Yes, I'm serious. Can you
please just go get a bag?

36:15.641 --> 36:17.174
My arms are full right now.

36:17.176 --> 36:18.341
Baby...

36:18.343 --> 36:20.477
My arms are full
with Davy Jones.

36:20.479 --> 36:23.246
Jen. Jen, please.

36:23.248 --> 36:24.481
Jen, can we please just...

36:24.483 --> 36:27.217
Farhang, could you go
fucking do it, please?

36:37.428 --> 36:39.162
Okay...

36:39.164 --> 36:40.164
Okay.

36:40.631 --> 36:42.098
You've proved your point.
Okay?

36:42.100 --> 36:43.366
Can we just...

36:47.439 --> 36:49.272
Jen! Jen!
Jen, what the f...

36:50.776 --> 36:52.709
- Shit!
- Jen!

36:52.711 --> 36:54.611
What are you fucking doing
with the fucking sink?!

36:54.613 --> 36:55.912
Get the cat out!

36:55.914 --> 36:58.381
Stop! Stop!

36:58.383 --> 36:59.916
Stop right...

36:59.918 --> 37:00.951
Stop!

37:01.385 --> 37:02.185
Stop! Stop, baby!

37:02.187 --> 37:02.185
- Fine.
- Baby, please!

37:02.187 --> 37:06.156
Shut up, farhang. Shut up or I'm
gonna fucking make you do this!

37:06.158 --> 37:07.824
- Stop, please.
- Do you wanna fucking do this?

37:07.826 --> 37:09.159
Can you, please...
How can...

37:09.161 --> 37:10.860
- Shh, shh, shh.
- Stop!

37:10.862 --> 37:12.963
- Shh.
- Baby...

37:12.965 --> 37:14.130
Baby...

37:15.333 --> 37:16.700
Baby...

37:16.702 --> 37:17.867
Oh, my fucking god.

37:20.037 --> 37:21.538
Holy fuck.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.274
Holy fuck, Jen!

37:24.276 --> 37:27.110
Fucking cat tore me to shit.

37:27.112 --> 37:28.612
Fuck me. Ow.

37:29.413 --> 37:31.081
He wanted to go swimming!

37:31.083 --> 37:32.482
Oh, my god.

37:34.885 --> 37:37.287
Oh, baby, was that hard?

37:37.888 --> 37:39.328
It's just a fucking cat.

37:40.992 --> 37:42.726
Don't be such a baby. It's going
to be a lot easier with a person.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.060
Don't worry.

37:44.062 --> 37:45.729
Can you do me a big favor
and clean this up?

37:45.731 --> 37:48.231
I'm really tired
and I want to go to bed, okay?

37:48.233 --> 37:49.499
Just put him
in a dry garbage bag,

37:49.501 --> 37:50.533
and we can drop him off...

37:50.535 --> 37:51.835
Put him in the freezer
and we can drop it off

37:51.837 --> 37:54.137
at a park tomorrow,
or something.

37:54.139 --> 37:55.405
Okay?

38:00.312 --> 38:01.678
Morning.

38:01.680 --> 38:02.946
Mornin'!

38:02.948 --> 38:05.148
How's it goin'?

38:05.150 --> 38:07.550
- It's going well.
- Ooh, you're looking good today.

38:07.552 --> 38:09.319
Yeah, I have like a...

38:09.321 --> 38:11.121
like a year-end review
kind of thing.

38:11.123 --> 38:13.423
Oh babe, you're gonna kill it.
You look fantastic.

38:13.425 --> 38:15.558
I like the tie combo.
- Thank you.

38:15.560 --> 38:17.594
Are you not
goin' into work today?

38:17.596 --> 38:19.729
Oh, I'm-I'm playing hooky.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.668
Are-are you okay?

38:24.670 --> 38:28.705
You seem a little bit...
Upset about last night.

38:28.707 --> 38:30.273
- No, no.
- You sure?

38:30.275 --> 38:31.808
No, it's fine.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.043
It's fine.

38:33.045 --> 38:34.477
I should probably get goin'.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.112
Yeah. Come here.
Gimme a kiss!

38:36.114 --> 38:37.514
You'll be great.
You'll be great today.

38:37.516 --> 38:38.848
I believe in you.

38:43.387 --> 38:45.789
And I have a busy day, too.

38:45.791 --> 38:47.190
Shh.

38:50.761 --> 38:58.234
He should be...
Somewhere around... here.

38:58.236 --> 38:59.769
Ah, there he is.

39:02.139 --> 39:03.473
Hey, Gary.

39:03.475 --> 39:05.975
- Oh, hey!
- What's goin' on?

39:05.977 --> 39:08.044
Not a whole lot.
You, uh...

39:08.046 --> 39:09.279
You remembered me!

39:09.281 --> 39:10.814
Of course, I remember you.

39:10.816 --> 39:14.117
It's uh...
Jen the director lady, right?

39:14.119 --> 39:16.119
- Yeah, sure is.
- How's your movie comin'?

39:16.121 --> 39:17.654
The big picture.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.122
It's really comin' along.

39:19.124 --> 39:21.991
You know what, actually,
I think it's almost done.

39:21.993 --> 39:24.327
So, I had this idea...

39:24.329 --> 39:27.364
and feel free
to say no if you want,

39:27.366 --> 39:29.366
but I was wondering if you would

39:29.368 --> 39:32.102
grace us with your presence
for dinner tonight.

39:32.104 --> 39:34.003
- Uh.
- At my house.

39:34.005 --> 39:35.538
- Yeah, sure, sure.
- Yeah?

39:35.540 --> 39:35.538
- Yeah!
- Really?!

39:35.540 --> 39:38.842
- Yeah!
- Oh, great! I'm so excited!

39:38.844 --> 39:41.077
I'm really glad.
Does tonight work for you?

39:41.079 --> 39:42.846
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

39:42.848 --> 39:45.048
I'm parked around the corner.
Let's go.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.783
- Right now?
- Yeah, right now.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.885
I gotta
get my things together...

39:48.887 --> 39:50.987
- Of course, of course.
- And tidy up the place.

39:50.989 --> 39:53.056
Lock the door before we leave.

39:53.058 --> 39:56.326
Yeah, yeah, you don't wanna
get your stuff jacked.

39:56.328 --> 39:58.094
You don't mind if I film you
while we go?

39:58.096 --> 40:00.463
No, sure.
That's-that's fine.

40:00.465 --> 40:02.198
You're my muse, Gary.

40:02.200 --> 40:05.468
Thank you, thank you.

40:05.470 --> 40:06.870
This one right here?

40:06.872 --> 40:08.037
Just throw your stuff anywhere,

40:08.039 --> 40:09.806
wherever you're comfortable.

40:09.808 --> 40:11.307
Okay.

40:13.110 --> 40:14.677
Look at you.
The camera loves you.

40:14.679 --> 40:16.346
Hey, do you wanna-
do you wanna try?

40:16.348 --> 40:19.215
- Uh, yeah, sure.
- Take it, take it.

40:19.217 --> 40:21.251
Go for it.
Give her a shot.

40:21.253 --> 40:22.919
Just play with it.
- Okay.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.387
That's how I figured it out.

40:24.389 --> 40:26.756
This makes it
longer and shorter.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.324
That's zooming in
and zooming out.

40:29.594 --> 40:31.127
Look, you're a natural.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.564
Long and short.

40:34.566 --> 40:36.065
Our starlet.

40:36.901 --> 40:38.301
What do you like to eat, Gary?

40:38.303 --> 40:39.736
Um...

40:39.738 --> 40:41.538
I-I dunno, uh...

40:41.540 --> 40:45.074
I'm sure anything-anything you
wanna make is gonna be great.

40:45.076 --> 40:49.479
- And what about dessert?
- Uh, oh, boy... dessert?

40:49.481 --> 40:50.680
Yeah!

40:51.415 --> 40:53.316
I dunno.
What do-what do you like?

40:53.318 --> 40:55.652
I make-
I make pretty good apple pie,

40:55.654 --> 40:58.154
if we're going, like,
American classic.

40:58.156 --> 41:00.223
Or, um...
- American classic. That sounds good.

41:00.225 --> 41:02.492
All right, let's do it. We'll
do apple pie. Good to go?

41:02.494 --> 41:04.027
- Yeah, good to go.
- All right. Don't forget your seatbelt.

41:04.029 --> 41:05.795
We don't want you dyin'
on the way there.

41:05.797 --> 41:06.797
Yeah, sure.

41:07.832 --> 41:10.934
Make yourself at home, please.
Drop your coat anywhere.

41:10.936 --> 41:13.002
- Yeah, sure.
- Bannister, couch.

41:13.004 --> 41:14.504
- Bannister, okay.
- Tell you what, Gary.

41:14.506 --> 41:16.473
I'm just-I'm just gonna
get dinner started,

41:16.475 --> 41:20.276
uh, so why don't we get you
in a hot shower?

41:20.278 --> 41:22.345
I'll grab you a towel.
- Are you sure?

41:22.347 --> 41:24.848
Yeah, yeah, no, please, please.

41:24.850 --> 41:26.883
Get you cleaned up
and warmed up and whatnot.

41:26.885 --> 41:28.017
Okay.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.385
I'm sure I have some
of my dad's clothes

41:29.387 --> 41:31.788
kicking around here somewhere
I can grab you.

41:31.790 --> 41:33.957
Right up the stairs behind you.
I'll grab you a towel.

41:33.959 --> 41:35.225
All right. Up here?

41:35.227 --> 41:36.559
Yeah, yeah, right up that way.

41:36.561 --> 41:38.728
Get a hot shower going for you
while I start dinner.

41:38.730 --> 41:40.263
Okay.

41:44.301 --> 41:46.035
Hey!

41:46.037 --> 41:47.504
Hey, babe!

41:47.506 --> 41:48.872
How's it goin'?

41:48.874 --> 41:49.906
Good. How are ya?

41:49.908 --> 41:51.541
Welcome home, sweetie.

41:51.543 --> 41:54.210
Uh, you're cooking.
That smells incredible.

41:54.212 --> 41:57.614
Yeah, I'm making us dinner
and I have a little surprise.

41:57.616 --> 41:59.048
Hello!

41:59.050 --> 42:01.551
Oh, yep!
Just gown here, Gary!

42:01.553 --> 42:02.819
Come on down!

42:03.687 --> 42:05.054
Hey!

42:05.056 --> 42:07.557
You must be farhang, right?

42:07.559 --> 42:09.025
- Hi.
- Hey. Gary.

42:09.027 --> 42:10.393
- Gary.
- Yeah.

42:10.395 --> 42:12.262
Farhang.
Where's that name from?

42:12.264 --> 42:14.597
Uh, it's a persian name.

42:14.599 --> 42:16.032
Okay, yeah, yeah!

42:16.034 --> 42:17.233
Me and my buddy, Kenny,

42:17.235 --> 42:19.369
we were at this, like,
Ethiopian place the other day,

42:19.371 --> 42:21.004
and we bit of extra money,

42:21.006 --> 42:23.740
and, like, they have this,
like, soggy bread,

42:23.742 --> 42:25.108
it's kind of weird. It's...

42:25.110 --> 42:26.743
And they say, you know, like...

42:26.745 --> 42:28.912
everyone's always saying
jokes about Ethiopia,

42:28.914 --> 42:31.014
how it's like
they don't have much food.

42:31.016 --> 42:34.183
- Yeah, it's crazy. - But they
actually have... the servings are huge.

42:34.185 --> 42:35.685
It's crazy!

42:35.687 --> 42:37.053
I know you like it, right?
- That's great.

42:37.055 --> 42:39.722
Uh, Jen, do you mind if we...
Can we talk in the kitchen?

42:39.724 --> 42:41.257
Sorry to...
- okay, yeah.

42:41.259 --> 42:43.226
- You can tell me about the food...
- Okay, yeah.

42:43.228 --> 42:44.994
Sorry, he's just going to help
me out with something, Gary.

42:44.996 --> 42:47.297
Uh, you... why don't you
sit down on the couch?

42:47.299 --> 42:49.265
You can turn the TV on,

42:49.267 --> 42:50.300
you know,
make yourself comfortable.

42:50.302 --> 42:51.935
We'll be back in just a sec,
all right?

42:51.937 --> 42:53.336
Yeah.

42:54.772 --> 42:56.172
What...

42:56.874 --> 42:59.208
What's going on?
Who is that?

42:59.210 --> 43:00.710
That's Gary.

43:00.712 --> 43:02.612
He's gonna be
our dinner guest tonight.

43:02.614 --> 43:04.514
And I thought, you know,
he could use a hot meal

43:04.516 --> 43:06.649
and a hot shower, and, um...

43:06.651 --> 43:07.750
I just wanna...

43:07.752 --> 43:09.185
Why is he here?

43:09.187 --> 43:11.454
Because I'd like
to move some things along

43:11.456 --> 43:13.489
and get some stuff done

43:13.491 --> 43:15.224
and I'm the person to do it,
it seems.

43:15.226 --> 43:17.327
So I'm just gonna...

43:17.329 --> 43:18.728
So why don't you go in,

43:18.730 --> 43:21.564
keep Gary company
while I finish up dinner?

43:21.566 --> 43:24.367
- Uh... what do you mean,
move things along? - Go, go!

43:24.369 --> 43:26.035
- We never talked about this.
- It doesn't matter.

43:26.037 --> 43:28.204
Just go keep Gary company.
Chat with him.

43:28.206 --> 43:31.407
He's really nice, actually.
So go.

43:31.409 --> 43:33.876
I'm gonna stay in here
and get things done.

43:33.878 --> 43:33.876
Yeah.

43:33.878 --> 43:37.080
And I'm gonna get dinner done.
Okay?

43:38.148 --> 43:40.149
It'll be great.
I promise.

43:41.518 --> 43:43.386
Hey, where'd you get
these coasters?

43:43.388 --> 43:44.554
They're really cool.

43:44.556 --> 43:47.156
Uh, I think my mom
gave them to us.

43:47.158 --> 43:50.627
They're made of, like,
glass or something?

43:50.629 --> 43:52.962
Oh, man.

43:52.964 --> 43:55.798
This pork is, like...
It's just right.

43:55.800 --> 43:55.798
It's...

43:55.800 --> 43:59.068
I don't know what you did
about it, or with it,

43:59.070 --> 44:00.637
or whatever, it's, like...

44:00.639 --> 44:02.338
I dunno, it's, like,
soft on the inside,

44:02.340 --> 44:05.341
but, like, not gross soft,
but, like, a good soft.

44:05.343 --> 44:06.576
I... mm.

44:06.578 --> 44:08.478
It's a shame, though,
there's, like...

44:08.480 --> 44:12.315
Pork is so good and only, like,
I dunno,

44:12.317 --> 44:14.050
some people eat it.

44:14.052 --> 44:15.551
Like, theres...
You know, like,

44:15.553 --> 44:17.020
some religions, or whatever,

44:17.022 --> 44:18.454
are just like,
"no, I don't want any."

44:18.456 --> 44:21.991
I don't know why, but...
I don't know.

44:21.993 --> 44:24.027
It's good, it's good.
Good stuff.

44:24.029 --> 44:25.561
Those people are missing out.

44:25.563 --> 44:27.397
Sweetie, you're not eating.

44:27.399 --> 44:29.365
Is there something wrong
with your pork chop?

44:29.367 --> 44:33.102
Um... no, I just had
a late lunch is all.

44:33.104 --> 44:34.470
- Oh.
- It's a shame, man.

44:34.472 --> 44:36.139
It's good stuff.

44:37.508 --> 44:40.276
I'm just not hungry... is all.

44:41.445 --> 44:42.879
You know what?
You know what I think you need?

44:42.881 --> 44:45.081
I know what I need
is a glass of wine.

44:45.083 --> 44:46.482
Gary? Wine?

44:47.651 --> 44:50.653
Come on, you know... - yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's do it.

44:50.655 --> 44:52.155
Great, great.
Farhang, wine?

44:52.157 --> 44:53.723
I know you want wine.

44:55.592 --> 44:57.527
- Sure.
- Perfect, perfect.

44:57.529 --> 44:59.295
Gary, would you do me
a huge favor

44:59.297 --> 44:59.295
and hold the camera for me

44:59.297 --> 45:02.732
while I grab us
some libations, please?

45:02.734 --> 45:05.735
Okay.
For using it in the movie?

45:05.737 --> 45:08.538
Yeah, yeah, I really want
to see your perspective.

45:08.540 --> 45:10.540
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

45:10.542 --> 45:12.008
You remember where the zoom is.

45:12.010 --> 45:14.077
And the focus?
- I think so. I think so.

45:14.079 --> 45:15.511
You'll be fine.

45:15.513 --> 45:17.847
Farhang in the film.

45:17.849 --> 45:19.182
Yeah?

45:19.184 --> 45:21.050
Yeah, he's like a leading role.

45:21.052 --> 45:22.285
Leading role.

45:22.287 --> 45:23.920
Uh...

45:23.922 --> 45:28.224
So, like, what's your plan
for how to end the movie?

45:28.226 --> 45:30.560
Or I guess
you can't really plan it.

45:30.562 --> 45:32.128
It's like, uh...

45:32.130 --> 45:34.664
When you make a documentary,
it just sort of happens.

45:34.666 --> 45:39.135
It's not really my movie.
It's more... her thing.

45:41.371 --> 45:43.806
That's for you, Gary.

45:43.808 --> 45:45.208
There you go, sweetheart.

45:45.210 --> 45:45.208
Thanks.

45:45.210 --> 45:48.444
Here, I can take the camera
back from you.

45:48.446 --> 45:50.179
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:50.181 --> 45:52.749
Cheers, gents.
Gary, here's to your health.

45:52.751 --> 45:54.751
Oh, yeah, um...
I mean, I should...

45:54.753 --> 45:58.054
You guys are hosting,
so I should maybe do something,

45:58.056 --> 46:00.423
like maybe say a cheers
or whatever, or a toast.

46:00.425 --> 46:02.125
That's really sweet
of you, Gary. Go ahead.

46:02.127 --> 46:03.426
Yeah, um...

46:03.428 --> 46:05.895
I was just thinking, like,
you know,

46:05.897 --> 46:10.032
it's pretty cool
how, like, you know,

46:10.034 --> 46:11.901
a lot of people,
they don't really...

46:11.903 --> 46:14.637
You guys treated me
like family, like...

46:14.639 --> 46:19.008
Farhang's been really nice
and that's cool.

46:19.010 --> 46:20.843
Uh, and just, like,

46:20.845 --> 46:22.979
you know, most people
don't treat you like family.

46:22.981 --> 46:25.047
Me and Kenny we're always saying
how, like, at the shelter

46:25.049 --> 46:26.949
they just kind of move you
through and check a box,

46:26.951 --> 46:28.518
and they're just like,
"yeah, okay."

46:28.520 --> 46:31.854
So yeah, thanks.
Thanks to you guys.

46:31.856 --> 46:33.990
Thanks... uh, cheers.

46:33.992 --> 46:36.926
- Cheers, Gary.
- Awesome.

46:39.897 --> 46:41.531
How's that wine treatin' ya?

46:42.499 --> 46:44.500
- It's good, yeah.
- Great!

46:44.502 --> 46:46.068
Good wine.
Really good wine.

46:46.070 --> 46:47.670
Well, there's a whole
other bottle

46:47.672 --> 46:49.505
where that came from.
- Nice.

46:49.507 --> 46:51.674
Please, drink your fill.

46:51.676 --> 46:55.011
Farhang, it's rude not to drink
at a toast, sweetie.

47:00.117 --> 47:02.218
You know why people cheers?

47:02.220 --> 47:03.319
It's actually a show of faith

47:03.321 --> 47:06.088
that when you
clink your glasses together

47:06.090 --> 47:08.424
you get some of your wine
into their cup,

47:08.426 --> 47:09.792
and they get some of theirs
into yours,

47:09.794 --> 47:12.528
as a show of faith that you're
not actually poisoning them.

47:12.530 --> 47:13.696
- Oh.
- Isn't that cool?

47:13.698 --> 47:15.198
That's where cheersing comes from.
- Cool.

47:15.200 --> 47:16.632
- Yeah.
- Cool.

47:18.102 --> 47:20.469
So drink up, farhang.
We did our show of faith.

47:20.471 --> 47:23.306
Yeah, it's not like she
poisoned your wine. It's...

47:23.308 --> 47:25.107
That is really good.

47:26.176 --> 47:27.944
You're not going to have any?
I mean, like, she...

47:27.946 --> 47:28.978
Farhang, drink up.

47:28.980 --> 47:30.379
I don't mean, like,
I don't know...

47:30.381 --> 47:32.048
This is your meal, so it's...

47:32.050 --> 47:34.016
Uh...

47:34.018 --> 47:35.718
Listen, it's getting
kind of late.

47:35.720 --> 47:36.919
Um...

47:37.588 --> 47:39.021
You must be getting tired.

47:39.990 --> 47:42.592
How about...
I can take you over to a hotel.

47:42.594 --> 47:45.895
I can get you a room. I can drive you over.
- Yeah. Yeah, no.

47:45.897 --> 47:49.031
- A place to stay overnight.
- Farhang. Farhang!

47:49.033 --> 47:51.000
Sure, yeah. I mean...
Don't worry about it.

47:51.002 --> 47:53.569
I know that it's, like,

47:53.571 --> 47:54.904
a lot of stuff to deal with.

47:54.906 --> 47:57.673
Gary, please don't.
He didn't mean it.

47:57.675 --> 47:58.941
I wake up early for work,

47:58.943 --> 48:00.443
and I don't want you
to have to wake up early.

48:00.445 --> 48:02.044
You guys have already
done a lot.

48:02.046 --> 48:03.713
Please, Gary.
Please sit down.

48:03.715 --> 48:06.415
Farhang!
That is incredibly...

48:06.417 --> 48:08.351
Please, please, please.

48:08.353 --> 48:09.685
You can't leave
without having dessert.

48:09.687 --> 48:11.954
I made-i made pie.
- Uh...

48:11.956 --> 48:13.823
Gary, sit, please.

48:13.825 --> 48:16.025
- I mean...
- Please, at least stay for dessert.

48:16.027 --> 48:18.895
Okay? Please?
- Uh... yeah, yeah.

48:18.897 --> 48:20.196
I'm sorry.
Farhang, he didn't mean it.

48:20.198 --> 48:22.832
He's just cranky
after a long day at work.

48:22.834 --> 48:26.035
Sweetie, will you help me
with dessert please?

48:26.037 --> 48:27.236
Now.

48:32.542 --> 48:35.611
What the fuck was that?
What is he doing in our house?

48:35.613 --> 48:37.780
Just tell me what he's doing
in our house please.

48:37.782 --> 48:40.516
Farhang, is it so unreasonable
that a guy can get some charity

48:40.518 --> 48:42.251
and a warm meal
and a hot shower?

48:42.253 --> 48:43.719
Yes, it is.
That's bullshit.

48:43.721 --> 48:45.421
Tell me what he's doing here.

48:45.423 --> 48:47.857
Farhang, this is happening
sooner or later.

48:47.859 --> 48:49.292
I'm just getting the ball rolling.
- I'm not ready for it.

48:49.294 --> 48:50.826
You can't just spring this
on me.

48:50.828 --> 48:53.896
Jen, you can't just
bring someone home

48:53.898 --> 48:56.399
and poison them
and leave them in our house.

48:56.401 --> 48:59.468
Farhang, I didn't poison him.
I didn't poison him.

48:59.470 --> 49:01.971
Well, I can't do this.
I can't do this today.

49:01.973 --> 49:04.840
Fine, fine, you're right.
I didn't tell you, so what?

49:06.243 --> 49:08.244
Screw it.
Let's just...

49:08.246 --> 49:09.912
have some dessert...

49:09.914 --> 49:12.348
and then we'll send Gary
on his way.

49:12.350 --> 49:13.616
Did you poison the wine?

49:13.618 --> 49:15.818
No I did not poison the wine.

49:16.954 --> 49:20.489
I didn't poison the wine.
I promise.

49:20.491 --> 49:23.059
You had the wine,
I had the wine.

49:23.061 --> 49:24.794
I didn't poison the wine.

49:24.796 --> 49:26.929
Could you grab the pie
for me, please?

49:33.770 --> 49:37.073
We'll just have some dessert
and we'll send Gary on his way.

49:37.075 --> 49:38.941
If you still want to
really get him a hotel room,

49:38.943 --> 49:40.309
you can get him a hotel room.
Okay?

49:40.311 --> 49:41.444
Give me the pie.

49:41.446 --> 49:42.945
Promise me
you didn't poison the wine.

49:42.947 --> 49:44.113
I promise you
I didn't poison the wine.

49:44.115 --> 49:45.581
Give me the pie.
- Did you poison the pie?

49:45.583 --> 49:47.149
I didn't.

49:48.251 --> 49:50.653
Honey, I will eat the entire
pie right in front of you

49:50.655 --> 49:54.590
if that's what you want.
The pie is perfectly fine.

49:54.592 --> 49:55.725
Okay?
- Okay.

49:55.727 --> 49:57.226
Now give me the pie.

49:58.362 --> 50:00.496
Go... go apologize to Gary.

50:00.498 --> 50:01.630
Okay.

50:01.632 --> 50:03.332
So rude.

50:06.704 --> 50:08.270
What the fuck did you do?

50:08.272 --> 50:10.272
What the fuck did you do?
- Oh, Gary!

50:10.274 --> 50:13.009
What the fuck did you just
fucking promise me?

50:13.011 --> 50:14.477
One too many glasses of wine,
Gary?

50:14.479 --> 50:18.381
Want some pie?
Want some dessert, Gary?

50:18.383 --> 50:19.882
I told you...
- you just lied to me.

50:19.884 --> 50:21.484
Baby, I told you
I didn't poison him.

50:21.486 --> 50:22.752
He's not poisoned.

50:22.754 --> 50:24.820
Well, what the fuck is he doing?
He's fucking dead.

50:24.822 --> 50:26.455
No, he's not.
Look, he's breathing.

50:26.457 --> 50:27.957
He's perfectly alive and well.

50:27.959 --> 50:29.525
He's asleep.

50:29.527 --> 50:32.595
Aren't you, Gary?
He's just a little sleepy.

50:32.597 --> 50:34.063
He's a sleepy Gary.

50:34.065 --> 50:35.131
I can't do this.

50:35.133 --> 50:36.499
I can't do this.
- He looks so peaceful.

50:36.501 --> 50:38.868
Farhang, it's fine, it's fine.

50:38.870 --> 50:41.137
We are so prepared for this!

50:41.139 --> 50:43.806
Why did you bring a fucking stranger
into our house and poison him?

50:43.808 --> 50:43.806
What the fuck is wrong with you?

50:43.808 --> 50:46.876
- I didn't poison him.
- - What the fuck is wrong with you?

50:46.878 --> 50:48.077
I knocked him out.

50:48.079 --> 50:49.645
There's a huge difference.

50:49.647 --> 50:51.347
I wouldn't poison
some random person.

50:51.349 --> 50:52.581
I can't do this.
I can't fucking do this.

50:52.583 --> 50:54.450
- Farhang, yes, you can.
- This is so fucked.

50:54.452 --> 50:56.218
I can't fucking do this, baby.
I can't.

50:56.220 --> 50:57.787
- We have been preparing...
- I can't, can't, I can't.

50:57.789 --> 50:59.555
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up.

50:59.557 --> 51:01.023
Farhang, shut the fuck up.

51:01.025 --> 51:03.526
We have been... we have been...

51:03.528 --> 51:04.760
Shut the fuck up!

51:04.762 --> 51:05.961
We have been preparing for this
for months.

51:05.963 --> 51:08.431
You are not taking this
away from me. Okay?

51:08.433 --> 51:10.866
No, sit.
Get over here. Get over here.

51:10.868 --> 51:12.568
- I'm not fucking doing this.
- Farhang!

51:12.570 --> 51:13.836
Farhang, then what
are you gonna do?

51:13.838 --> 51:15.871
You just going to leave
this guy in our house?

51:15.873 --> 51:17.473
I'm not fucking doing this. I'm
getting out of this fucking house.

51:17.475 --> 51:19.909
All right, you're gonna
leave this guy in our house

51:19.911 --> 51:22.211
to wake up or call the cops.

51:22.213 --> 51:23.546
Farhang, get the fuck
over there.

51:23.548 --> 51:25.848
You're fucking ruining my fucking life.
I can't fucking do this!

51:25.850 --> 51:27.383
- Get over there, and pick him up...
- I'm not fucking touching him.

51:27.385 --> 51:28.784
- And put him in the fucking basement!
- I'm not touching him.

51:28.786 --> 51:30.553
- Put him in the goddamn basement!
- Get the fuck away from me!

51:30.555 --> 51:32.221
- Farhang!
- You lied to me!

51:32.223 --> 51:35.024
- I didn't lie to you!
- You lied to me!

51:35.026 --> 51:37.793
We're ready for this!
Get him up!

51:37.795 --> 51:39.061
Get him up!

51:40.465 --> 51:42.598
For fuck's sake,
you're being a fucking pussy.

51:42.600 --> 51:44.533
Crying about this.

51:44.535 --> 51:46.535
Acting like this is coming
out of goddamn nowhere.

51:46.537 --> 51:47.837
I can't fucking do this.

51:47.839 --> 51:50.339
Fuck! Get up!

51:50.341 --> 51:51.574
Get the arm.

51:51.576 --> 51:52.842
Okay? Get it!

51:52.844 --> 51:54.977
Get it! Stop crying!

51:59.784 --> 52:02.118
See, this is why I need
your fucking help.

52:27.812 --> 52:29.345
Oh, Gary.

52:34.484 --> 52:39.622
Not my first choice...
But you will do beautifully.

52:41.159 --> 52:42.892
Hey babe,
do you have everything?

52:43.960 --> 52:45.761
- Yeah.
- Good.

52:50.467 --> 52:52.535
Hey, Gary.

52:53.336 --> 52:54.837
Rise and shine.

52:56.273 --> 52:58.641
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

52:58.643 --> 53:00.843
Wake up, Gary.

53:00.845 --> 53:02.044
Wake up.

53:05.283 --> 53:07.883
Oh, great.
Hey, Gary.

53:07.885 --> 53:09.185
What are you waiting for?

53:09.187 --> 53:10.819
He has to be awake.
He has to know.

53:10.821 --> 53:13.622
Hi, Gary!
Morning.

53:13.624 --> 53:15.024
Wake up. Shh, shh, shh.

53:15.026 --> 53:16.258
Hey, hey, hey, no.
It's okay, it's okay.

53:16.260 --> 53:17.927
Remember me?

53:17.929 --> 53:19.929
Jen with the camera?

53:19.931 --> 53:21.797
Miss big director lady?

53:21.799 --> 53:23.532
We're making a movie, remember?

53:23.534 --> 53:25.334
Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay, it's okay.

53:25.336 --> 53:27.836
I told you you'd be a star.

53:27.838 --> 53:30.005
Remember me? With the camera?
Shh!

53:30.007 --> 53:31.373
Gary, Gary, Gary, shh.

53:31.375 --> 53:32.741
Listen to me.

53:32.743 --> 53:35.211
Gary! Shh!

53:35.213 --> 53:36.445
Gary!

53:36.447 --> 53:37.646
Look at me, look at me,
look at me.

53:37.648 --> 53:38.814
Look at me, look at me.

53:38.816 --> 53:41.016
Hi. It's okay.
It's all right.

53:41.018 --> 53:43.052
No, no, no!

53:43.054 --> 53:46.322
It's a great thing
that you're doing!

53:46.324 --> 53:49.325
No, shh. Shh.

53:50.060 --> 53:51.193
Shh.

53:51.195 --> 53:52.728
Farhang, can you come
get the camera, please?

53:52.730 --> 53:54.029
Now?!

53:54.698 --> 53:57.366
Can you take the damn camera?!

53:57.368 --> 53:59.535
For god's sake,
take the fucking camera.

54:01.138 --> 54:03.138
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

54:05.909 --> 54:07.042
It's okay.

54:17.721 --> 54:19.588
I can't, I can't.
Baby, no, I can't.

54:19.590 --> 54:21.390
Farhang, don't you take that
fucking camera off go me.

54:21.392 --> 54:22.992
After all the work
we put into this,

54:22.994 --> 54:24.660
you don't turn
that goddamn camera off.

54:24.662 --> 54:25.594
Ever.

54:25.596 --> 54:26.962
Don't move that goddamn camera,

54:26.964 --> 54:31.100
otherwise I've got fucking nothing.
You're ruining my shot.

54:32.570 --> 54:33.602
Are we ready?

54:34.571 --> 54:36.939
I'm really sorry that we
have to do this twice.

54:36.941 --> 54:38.741
It was supposed to go right
the first time.

54:41.544 --> 54:43.078
Farhang, get me...

54:46.550 --> 54:48.250
Farhang, he's gonna
break the chair.

54:48.252 --> 54:49.685
I need help.

54:49.687 --> 54:52.354
Farhang, put the camera down,
I need your help!

54:52.356 --> 54:53.589
Can you help me, please?

54:57.460 --> 54:58.961
Shh.

55:05.201 --> 55:06.568
Shh.

55:09.874 --> 55:13.542
Almost there.
It's's almost there.

55:13.544 --> 55:15.077
He's almost there.

55:15.712 --> 55:17.212
Pull.

55:32.696 --> 55:34.296
Oh, my god.

55:34.298 --> 55:35.864
Holy shit.

55:41.471 --> 55:43.539
He bit down so hard
it won't come out.

55:45.642 --> 55:47.109
Babe, we did it.

55:49.612 --> 55:52.181
Come here, come here.

56:35.125 --> 56:36.759
Okay.

56:37.560 --> 56:39.027
Now the hard part.

56:43.266 --> 56:44.566
Whoa!

56:45.535 --> 56:48.103
So they don't call it
dead weight for nothing.

56:48.105 --> 56:49.571
We've learned...
What did we learn today?

56:49.573 --> 56:50.906
Can you be careful
with the knife?

56:50.908 --> 56:52.541
Yes, yes, yes.

56:53.209 --> 56:55.277
This is a tool, not a toy.

56:55.279 --> 56:58.414
Gary's a big boy.
Aren't you, Gary?

56:58.416 --> 57:00.516
You're doing a good job. So...

57:00.518 --> 57:04.887
we're gonna...
Bleed him out now.

57:04.889 --> 57:07.289
I imagine it's like
sticking a pig.

57:07.291 --> 57:08.957
I've never stuck a pig before.

57:08.959 --> 57:11.460
But it's like prom night
for murder.

57:11.462 --> 57:14.463
Gary, you're taking my kill virginity.
I'm stoked.

57:14.465 --> 57:16.064
Are you stoked?

57:16.066 --> 57:17.800
Babe, could you go down
so we can...

57:17.802 --> 57:19.268
get all of that brutal glory?

57:19.270 --> 57:20.969
It's going to be so exciting.

57:20.971 --> 57:22.371
You ready, Gary?

57:25.442 --> 57:27.142
Oh!

57:28.244 --> 57:29.511
Yes.

57:50.333 --> 57:51.667
That was awesome.

57:52.168 --> 57:53.836
Holy shit.

57:54.370 --> 57:56.305
You're bloody guy, Gary.

57:56.307 --> 57:57.906
Babe, you wanna hand me
the bleach?

57:58.908 --> 58:00.108
Yeah.

58:00.110 --> 58:01.343
Thanks, babe.

58:04.147 --> 58:06.348
So we just gotta...

58:06.350 --> 58:08.183
let him, you know,

58:08.185 --> 58:09.518
drain for a little while

58:09.520 --> 58:11.353
then we'll chop up the rest,
yeah?

58:12.789 --> 58:13.856
Shall we?

58:19.662 --> 58:20.996
Oh, that's awesome.

58:20.998 --> 58:22.097
Be careful.

58:22.099 --> 58:25.467
The power between my legs!

58:25.469 --> 58:27.903
This was a good buy, babe.
Good buy, good job.

58:27.905 --> 58:29.838
All right cool,
give me the camera. Switch.

58:29.840 --> 58:31.540
- What?
- Switch!

58:31.542 --> 58:33.375
Farhang, switch.
- No.

58:33.377 --> 58:34.576
What do you mean, no?

58:34.578 --> 58:37.246
I... why don't...
You can just do it.

58:37.248 --> 58:39.581
Don't be such a fucking baby.
I bled him out from the neck.

58:39.583 --> 58:41.483
- Yeah, you can do the rest.
- Take the saber saw.

58:41.485 --> 58:43.352
- Just grab it and you do it.
- You practiced.

58:43.354 --> 58:44.820
Don't be such a baby.
- It's easy.

58:44.822 --> 58:46.188
You just press the button,
and it works.

58:46.190 --> 58:47.923
Oh, my god. We have...

58:47.925 --> 58:50.158
a decomposing body
in our bathtub right now.

58:50.160 --> 58:52.027
You don't need practice,
you can just do it.

58:52.029 --> 58:52.027
It's not about practice,
it's about,

58:52.029 --> 58:55.130
I did that part and now
it's your turn to do yours.

58:55.132 --> 58:57.199
Give me the camera.

58:57.201 --> 58:59.568
Give me the camera, switch.
- Okay, all right.

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:22.484
I brought you a garbage bag.

01:00:26.422 --> 01:00:28.090
Are you gonna help me with this?

01:00:28.092 --> 01:00:30.826
I'm filming, babe.
I have my own job to do.

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:33.729
Okay, babe, good job.

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:35.897
Yep, just give it a...

01:00:36.899 --> 01:00:39.201
I think red is really
your color, sweetheart.

01:00:41.604 --> 01:00:44.006
Geez, Gary is starting to stank.

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:47.676
Here.

01:00:55.118 --> 01:00:56.485
Babe.

01:00:56.487 --> 01:00:57.786
Babe, he's decomposing.

01:00:57.788 --> 01:00:58.954
We gotta-
we gotta get this done.

01:00:58.956 --> 01:01:00.555
We have to
get this done tonight.

01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:07.729
Babe, all of th-all of that is not
gonna fit in that tiny little...

01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:10.799
Yeah, yeah, okay.

01:01:10.801 --> 01:01:12.034
Okay...

01:01:12.036 --> 01:01:13.935
You think you can
do some, or...?

01:01:15.038 --> 01:01:17.005
Babe, I am documenting
all of this.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:20.976
It's an important job too,
you know, seriously.

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:28.083
Looking good, Gary.

01:01:28.085 --> 01:01:30.852
Can you not-
can you not call him that?

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:32.254
Call him what?

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:35.257
What? Call him Gary?

01:01:35.259 --> 01:01:35.257
Babe.
- Just don't use his name.

01:01:35.259 --> 01:01:38.226
It's really fucked up
that you're using his name.

01:01:38.228 --> 01:01:39.428
Well, he was a person.
I think we should

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:41.463
pay some respect to that.
- Yeah, was.

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:44.399
It's fucking starting to smell.

01:01:44.401 --> 01:01:47.302
That's why we need to get him
in the freezer, babe.

01:01:47.304 --> 01:01:50.372
Blood fucking all over me.

01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:52.040
You're doing
a really good job, babe.

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:55.177
We're almost there.
We're almost there.

01:01:55.179 --> 01:01:57.145
Just take a minute.
Take whatever time you need

01:01:57.147 --> 01:01:59.214
but we need to get him
in the freezer

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:01.249
before he starts to stink
any more.

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:07.622
Did you hear that?

01:02:07.624 --> 01:02:08.790
What the fuck was that?

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:11.246
I think it sounded
like the door, babe.

01:02:13.664 --> 01:02:14.763
Oh, yep, yep.
That was definitely the door.

01:02:14.765 --> 01:02:14.763
Do you think somebody
heard something?

01:02:14.765 --> 01:02:17.999
They know that we're home.
Our fucking lights are on.

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:22.471
Okay, fine. You know what?
I'll go... see who it is.

01:02:22.473 --> 01:02:23.538
You've got blood on you.

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.574
I'll put a sweater on.

01:02:25.576 --> 01:02:27.409
Here, I'll take the mic...

01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:29.344
you take the headphones.

01:02:29.346 --> 01:02:31.413
You'll be able to hear
everything that's going on.

01:02:31.415 --> 01:02:32.415
Okay?

01:02:33.015 --> 01:02:35.217
Just stay here, stay quiet,

01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:36.885
and I will be right back, okay?

01:02:36.887 --> 01:02:38.286
Take the camera.

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:42.691
All right?

01:02:50.034 --> 01:02:50.933
<i>Hi.</i>

01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:53.401
<i>I am really sorry to bother you.</i>

01:02:53.403 --> 01:02:54.603
<i>I am looking for my cat.</i>

01:02:54.605 --> 01:02:58.406
<i>His name is mittens
and this is the picture.</i>

01:02:58.408 --> 01:03:00.308
<i>What an adorable kitty.</i>

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:01.843
<i>How long has he been missing?</i>

01:03:01.845 --> 01:03:03.745
<i>In the night he went out</i>

01:03:03.747 --> 01:03:05.380
<i>and he didn't come back
in the morning.</i>

01:03:05.382 --> 01:03:06.815
<i>Oh, honey, I'm so sorry
to hear that.</i>

01:03:06.817 --> 01:03:08.316
<i>You know, I had
the cutest little thing</i>

01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:09.951
<i>that looked just like that
when I was a kid.</i>

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:12.087
<i>I was devastated
when he ran away.</i>

01:03:12.089 --> 01:03:14.589
<i>Just all day walking around,</i>

01:03:14.591 --> 01:03:17.292
<i>and all these cars
are driving so fast</i>

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:20.128
<i>and these dogs
not on a leash around.</i>

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:20.128
<i>Well, I haven't seen him.</i>

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:23.832
<i>I'll ask my husband when he-
when he gets back.</i>

01:03:23.962 --> 01:03:25.101
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

01:03:25.102 --> 01:03:27.569
<i>Of course.
We'll keep an eye out for him.</i>

01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:29.504
<i>I'm sure-I'm sure
he'll come back eventually.</i>

01:03:29.506 --> 01:03:31.139
<i>Thank you, thank you, thank you.</i>

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:32.774
<i>Have a good night, sweetie.</i>

01:03:32.776 --> 01:03:33.975
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:42.717
How'd that go?

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:45.487
How'd it go, how'd it go?

01:03:45.489 --> 01:03:48.290
Relax, babe, some old lady
just lost her cat.

01:03:48.292 --> 01:03:50.659
And he was just
the cutest little thing.

01:03:50.661 --> 01:03:52.661
Little white mittens
and little black face.

01:03:52.663 --> 01:03:54.563
Did she see any blood?
Did she suspect anything?

01:03:54.565 --> 01:03:56.198
You have blood on your collar.

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:58.800
I wrapped up.

01:03:58.802 --> 01:04:02.370
No blood on my hands.
Nothing up my sleeve.

01:04:02.372 --> 01:04:03.538
Babe, calm down.

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:05.674
She was just looking
for her cat, okay?

01:04:05.676 --> 01:04:06.842
Cat's long gone.

01:04:06.844 --> 01:04:08.677
Why don't I take over from here?

01:04:08.679 --> 01:04:10.478
You can hold the camera

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.048
and I will finish this up, okay?

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:15.083
Yeah? Okay.

01:04:23.108 --> 01:04:25.027
Shit babe, you know, we gotta...

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:28.864
We should probably do something
about fingerprints, eh?

01:04:28.866 --> 01:04:30.232
Teeth.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.933
We gotta do the teeth.

01:04:31.935 --> 01:04:33.168
Uh, could you
go back to the freezer

01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:34.903
and get the bag
with his head in it...

01:04:34.905 --> 01:04:36.571
and some pliers, please?

01:04:36.573 --> 01:04:37.706
Yeah, sure.

01:04:37.708 --> 01:04:38.940
Thank you.

01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:53.588
Nice pearlies, Gary.

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:00.262
Ah, fuck!

01:05:00.264 --> 01:05:01.663
Jesus!

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:10.805
I think there's a reason why dentists
make more money than butchers.

01:05:10.807 --> 01:05:12.140
Okay.

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:21.149
There we go.

01:05:36.532 --> 01:05:38.066
Watch your head.

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:42.470
I guess we can tell
who cleans in this house, yeah?

01:05:42.472 --> 01:05:45.540
Don't use paper towel,
your wasting trees!

01:05:45.542 --> 01:05:47.309
It's not coming off
with the sponge.

01:05:47.311 --> 01:05:49.277
- Of course, it's coming off.
- No, I have to absorb it.

01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:50.478
Well babe, why don't we just do

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:51.646
a first pass at it

01:05:51.648 --> 01:05:53.682
and we'll get down
to the finer details later.

01:05:53.684 --> 01:05:55.283
The sponge is just
moving it, though.

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:57.118
If I use the paper towel,
I'll absorb it.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.287
If you use the green side
of the sponge,

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:01.856
it smears it around. If you use
the yellow side of the sponge...

01:06:01.858 --> 01:06:03.425
I used both! I just did it.

01:06:03.427 --> 01:06:04.626
It's like a wine stain.

01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:06.761
Just sop of up the worst of it

01:06:06.763 --> 01:06:10.899
and then we'll use the products
to clean it up after.

01:06:10.901 --> 01:06:14.302
Can you let me just do it
the way that I'm doing it?

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:15.737
Okay.

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:19.607
There you go!
That's using your head.

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:40.228
Babe, make-make-make sure
you get the outer sides too.

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:42.263
And there's a whole bunch
along the outside.

01:06:42.265 --> 01:06:43.531
I'm getting there,
I'm starting here.

01:06:43.533 --> 01:06:44.799
And there's shit
all over the floor.

01:06:44.801 --> 01:06:47.235
Can you shut the fuck up?!
Can you shut up?!

01:06:53.542 --> 01:06:55.076
Okay.

01:06:56.145 --> 01:06:58.813
Well, you know, babe,
if we ever needed an excuse

01:06:58.815 --> 01:07:01.116
to redo the floors
and the bathtub,

01:07:01.118 --> 01:07:02.951
I would say this
is a decent one.

01:07:06.255 --> 01:07:07.756
Oh gross.

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:10.792
I think I found...

01:07:10.794 --> 01:07:12.894
a piece of something, anyway.

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:33.882
You know, I think...

01:07:33.884 --> 01:07:35.683
I think that went
really well, right?

01:07:35.685 --> 01:07:36.951
Don't you?

01:07:39.488 --> 01:07:41.089
It's not done yet, so...

01:07:41.091 --> 01:07:42.524
No, I'm feeling good.
I'm good about this.

01:07:42.526 --> 01:07:43.925
We're good.

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:45.660
We got it done.

01:07:45.662 --> 01:07:47.362
It's not done.

01:07:47.364 --> 01:07:48.563
Well, almost.
It's just, like,

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:50.331
the last little bit.

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:54.202
Come on, babe, we should
be proud of ourselves.

01:07:54.204 --> 01:07:56.004
We're not out of the woods yet.

01:07:58.007 --> 01:08:00.875
No, we're going into the woods.

01:08:18.794 --> 01:08:20.161
Can you help me?

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:21.395
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Put the camera down.

01:08:21.398 --> 01:08:23.298
All right.
Okay, okay, sorry.

01:08:33.408 --> 01:08:35.243
- Okay?
- Yep, yep.

01:08:35.245 --> 01:08:36.444
Take it from the bottom.

01:08:48.858 --> 01:08:50.225
Watch the shovel.

01:08:58.134 --> 01:08:59.533
You're doing such a good job,
babe.

01:08:59.536 --> 01:09:01.603
Look how fucking strong you are.

01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:04.104
Keep an eye out
for poison Ivy, too.

01:09:04.107 --> 01:09:06.241
I'm pretty sure it's bad
in there.

01:09:35.938 --> 01:09:37.205
Ah, fuck.

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:51.486
Oh!

01:09:51.488 --> 01:09:52.886
Fuck. Ugh.

01:09:52.889 --> 01:09:54.422
Close it.

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:57.592
Attract some fucking dogs
or something.

01:09:58.627 --> 01:09:59.894
Can you shine the light
right here?

01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:01.296
Yep, yep.

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:09.304
Oh, fuck.

01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:20.515
Good job, babe.

01:10:20.517 --> 01:10:21.816
You're doing great.

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:25.286
Fuck.

01:10:28.257 --> 01:10:29.958
Oh, fuck.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.226
Are you okay?

01:10:31.228 --> 01:10:32.293
What's the matter?
What happened? What happened?

01:10:32.295 --> 01:10:34.662
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

01:10:34.664 --> 01:10:36.364
Nothing!
Can you fucking help me?

01:10:36.366 --> 01:10:37.632
Put the camera down and help me.

01:10:37.634 --> 01:10:39.534
Um, babe, I'm documenting
the process.

01:10:39.536 --> 01:10:39.534
This is going to take all night

01:10:39.536 --> 01:10:42.537
if you're just fucking filming
the whole thing.

01:10:42.539 --> 01:10:44.939
Can you just put the fucking camera
down so we can dig a fucking hole?

01:10:44.941 --> 01:10:46.674
This is fucking going to take
all fucking night.

01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:48.376
Okay, geez.
Okay, no, babe.

01:10:48.378 --> 01:10:49.444
But, like, just...

01:10:49.446 --> 01:10:51.346
Can I get a little bit more
of you digging,

01:10:51.348 --> 01:10:53.381
like a little bit more of you digging?
- No! No, you can't!

01:10:53.383 --> 01:10:55.583
No you fucking can't!
Turn off the fucking camera!

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:58.553
We need to dig
this fucking hole!

01:10:58.555 --> 01:11:00.355
I'm gonna fucking blow
my fucking shoulder out!

01:11:00.357 --> 01:11:00.355
Shh. Stop yelling at me, okay?

01:11:00.357 --> 01:11:04.092
I'm not fucking yelling. Put the
fucking camera down, turn it off!

01:11:04.094 --> 01:11:05.760
- Okay, okay.
- Is it off? Turn it off!

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:05.760
Okay, turning it off.
I'm turning it off.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:08.963
I'm turning it off. I'm turning it off.
I'm putting it down.

01:11:08.965 --> 01:11:10.665
Just calm down. Relax.
- Is it off?

01:11:10.667 --> 01:11:13.401
Yes, it's off.
It's down. Relax, okay?

01:11:13.403 --> 01:11:14.702
Just let me...
I want to put it somewhere.

01:11:14.704 --> 01:11:17.772
I don't want to kick it
or lose it in the dark.

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:19.941
It fucking stinks, god damn it.

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:21.776
Yeah, geez, Gary.
You're a smelly man.

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:23.244
Come on, I'm helping.

01:11:23.246 --> 01:11:24.812
Can you grab the shovel?

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:27.315
You could at least laugh.

01:11:31.754 --> 01:11:33.521
This isn't that hard.

01:12:12.661 --> 01:12:14.529
All fresh and clean?

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:16.731
Huh?

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:28.643
Farhang?

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:33.381
Farhang?

01:12:40.222 --> 01:12:42.323
Do you really need to be
filming right now?

01:12:42.325 --> 01:12:44.892
Well, yeah, there's a couple
of little things to get.

01:12:44.894 --> 01:12:46.227
We have to burn the clothes

01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:49.163
and I'm probably going to do
another run of the bathroom.

01:12:49.165 --> 01:12:51.199
Probably pick up
some more bleach at the store.

01:12:51.201 --> 01:12:52.800
I'm too fucking tired
to do that.

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:11.853
We did it.

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:41.549
Cheers, Gary.

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:53.628
Ah.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:07.875
You like the pork, Gary?
Yeah?

01:14:07.877 --> 01:14:09.410
This is some great pork,
you know.

01:14:09.412 --> 01:14:12.213
It's squishy, but not
gross squishy on the inside.

01:14:12.215 --> 01:14:13.281
You know?

01:14:13.283 --> 01:14:14.882
You like wine, Gary?

01:14:14.884 --> 01:14:16.884
Good wine, yeah?
Yeah?

01:14:16.886 --> 01:14:20.588
Yeah, this is-this is
the best wine I've ever had.

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:23.424
I think I'd like to make
a cheers to you guys.

01:14:23.426 --> 01:14:25.026
You know,
you take me into your house

01:14:25.028 --> 01:14:27.161
and you treat me like family.

01:14:28.063 --> 01:14:29.197
You know, farhang,

01:14:29.199 --> 01:14:31.899
why aren't you eating
your dinner here?

01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:33.434
Poor bastard.

01:14:41.443 --> 01:14:42.844
Hello, babe!

01:14:42.846 --> 01:14:44.846
- Hey.
- How are we?

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:47.915
- Not bad.
- Good. Good day?

01:14:47.917 --> 01:14:49.484
I got lots done today.

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.254
Yeah?

01:14:53.256 --> 01:14:54.689
Don't you want to hear
what I did?

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:57.124
Go ahead.

01:14:57.126 --> 01:15:01.295
I... did another once-over
of the bathroom,

01:15:01.297 --> 01:15:03.197
and it is spotless,

01:15:03.199 --> 01:15:05.633
and I...

01:15:05.635 --> 01:15:09.337
checked the basement
for hair and blood traces,

01:15:09.339 --> 01:15:11.639
and I burned the clothes,

01:15:11.641 --> 01:15:14.942
and I made a necklace
out of Gary's teeth.

01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:18.045
Oh, there he is.

01:15:18.047 --> 01:15:21.816
I've done more cleaning in the basement
than I have since we moved in here.

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:25.653
- Okay.
- Yeah!

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:28.723
You didn't grab a beer for me?

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:31.893
I'm joking, I'm joking.
- What're you doing?

01:15:31.895 --> 01:15:33.895
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:37.231
What do you mean?

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:41.235
I thought this was over.
We did everything.

01:15:41.237 --> 01:15:42.237
Yeah...

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:45.172
Doesn't mean we can't play
with it and use it.

01:15:45.174 --> 01:15:46.707
Yeah, but this is over.

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:48.376
This whole thing.

01:15:48.378 --> 01:15:50.344
Babe. Hey, careful!

01:15:50.346 --> 01:15:52.046
Why don't you understand that I
don't want to see it right now?

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:54.982
You can't piece together
why I'm uncomfortable with it?

01:15:54.984 --> 01:15:57.518
I want to get the after effect.

01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.420
Put the camera-
put the camera away.

01:15:59.422 --> 01:16:01.522
- Farhang.
- Please put the camera away.

01:16:01.524 --> 01:16:03.624
Promise me that it's over.

01:16:03.626 --> 01:16:05.793
Okay, I promise. I promise.

01:16:05.795 --> 01:16:07.562
And we can go back to normal.

01:16:07.564 --> 01:16:09.797
Okay, we'll go back to normal.

01:16:18.974 --> 01:16:23.377
There you are,
you fucking little rat.

01:16:23.379 --> 01:16:24.512
Come on out.

01:16:45.435 --> 01:16:46.901
Really, buddy?

01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:58.446
Hey!

01:16:58.448 --> 01:16:59.780
Hey.

01:17:00.917 --> 01:17:03.050
How's it going, babe?

01:17:03.052 --> 01:17:04.318
Not bad.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.427
Do you need something?

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:20.501
Why the fuck do you have that?

01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:22.637
What do you mean?

01:17:22.639 --> 01:17:23.838
Don't give me that.

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.407
Why do you have the camera
in your hand?

01:17:26.409 --> 01:17:28.876
Were you outside
with the camera right now?

01:17:28.878 --> 01:17:30.544
- Yeah.
- Why?

01:17:30.546 --> 01:17:32.913
Why do you need the camera
outside for a walk?

01:17:32.915 --> 01:17:35.616
Weren't you just saying
we were done with this?

01:17:35.618 --> 01:17:37.752
Why are you pointing
the fucking camera at me?

01:17:37.754 --> 01:17:38.819
Okay, fine.

01:17:38.821 --> 01:17:40.454
You just said
we were done fucking filming.

01:17:40.456 --> 01:17:42.189
Farhang, careful,
you're gonna break it!

01:17:42.191 --> 01:17:43.724
- Stop!
- - You just said we were fucking done.

01:17:43.726 --> 01:17:45.126
Listen to me. Okay?

01:17:45.128 --> 01:17:47.928
We went through every fucking
step of your disgusting plan.

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:47.928
All right?

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:52.800
We did every fucking thing
that you asked me to.

01:17:52.802 --> 01:17:54.969
And I asked you for one thing.

01:17:57.039 --> 01:17:58.105
You fine?

01:17:58.107 --> 01:18:01.375
You feel really proud
of what you did the other day?

01:18:01.377 --> 01:18:02.910
Tell me what you did.

01:18:03.712 --> 01:18:06.313
What we did?
What we did, farhang?

01:18:06.315 --> 01:18:08.649
Yeah, what you made me do,
and I fucking followed through.

01:18:08.651 --> 01:18:10.451
You feel good about what you did...
- I feel fine.

01:18:10.453 --> 01:18:13.287
To that innocent
fucking homeless,

01:18:13.289 --> 01:18:16.057
did nothing wrong in his fucking life guy?
- I didn't want to kill Gary.

01:18:16.059 --> 01:18:18.059
He was not my first choice.

01:18:18.061 --> 01:18:19.927
So it's my fucking fault?

01:18:19.929 --> 01:18:21.462
Don't you fucking
put that shit...

01:18:21.464 --> 01:18:23.230
Don't you fucking
put that shit on me.

01:18:23.232 --> 01:18:24.865
- I wanted to... - Don't you
fucking put that shit on me.

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:27.968
Fine, I wanted to kill somebody
who wasn't innocent!

01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:29.670
Gary was a nice guy
and I liked him,

01:18:29.672 --> 01:18:30.971
- I didn't want to kill him.
- - Yes, he didn't deserve to die.

01:18:30.973 --> 01:18:30.971
There was an asshole out there.

01:18:30.973 --> 01:18:34.175
But you fucking decided that
we have to commit murder now.

01:18:34.177 --> 01:18:35.776
There was an asshole out there
who deserved to die

01:18:35.778 --> 01:18:37.178
but you wouldn't let me.

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:39.580
No, he fucking doesn't either.

01:18:39.582 --> 01:18:41.382
- Babe, please.
- We're done!

01:18:41.384 --> 01:18:42.516
- Please, just come here.
- We're done!

01:18:42.518 --> 01:18:44.518
Stop it. We're done!

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:46.687
Promise me.

01:18:46.689 --> 01:18:48.189
Tell me we're done.

01:18:48.191 --> 01:18:50.424
We're done, okay?
God.

01:18:50.426 --> 01:18:53.060
How the fuck am I supposed
to have a life with you?

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:55.429
I can't fucking trust
anything that you say.

01:18:55.431 --> 01:18:56.597
Farhang, don't talk like that!

01:18:56.599 --> 01:18:58.632
The one thing I fucking
asked you for,

01:18:58.634 --> 01:18:59.634
you couldn't do.

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:03.504
Fine, okay. The camera,
it's gone, you have it.

01:19:03.506 --> 01:19:06.574
It's done.
Okay, it's done.

01:19:06.576 --> 01:19:07.641
Promise me!

01:19:07.643 --> 01:19:09.844
I promise.
Just put it away.

01:19:11.513 --> 01:19:13.447
Want it gone? It's gone.
- Fucking...

01:19:13.449 --> 01:19:16.016
Like, your words fucking
mean nothing to me.

01:19:25.026 --> 01:19:26.160
Hey.

01:19:29.831 --> 01:19:31.031
Hey.

01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:45.546
You okay?

01:19:47.816 --> 01:19:49.583
I'm trying to be.

01:19:50.552 --> 01:19:53.154
Sorry I got
completely carried away.

01:19:57.459 --> 01:20:00.094
I'll try and do better, okay?

01:20:00.096 --> 01:20:01.829
I just want...

01:20:03.498 --> 01:20:06.066
I just want everything
to go back to normal.

01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:09.937
No more filming.

01:20:11.206 --> 01:20:13.774
No more cameras,
no more craziness.

01:20:14.609 --> 01:20:16.577
Things'll get better.
Okay? I...

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:20.214
I love you.

01:20:20.216 --> 01:20:21.348
I'm sorry.

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:24.819
What was that?

01:20:24.821 --> 01:20:26.120
What was what?

01:20:26.688 --> 01:20:27.822
What're you looking at?

01:20:27.824 --> 01:20:29.623
I'm not looking at anything.

01:20:29.625 --> 01:20:30.825
Come here.

01:20:30.827 --> 01:20:32.960
Farhang, come here and kiss me.

01:20:32.962 --> 01:20:34.028
What were you looking at?

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:35.629
Stop. Come on.
Come here and take me.

01:20:35.631 --> 01:20:37.231
- Jen...
- Come on, come to bed.

01:20:37.233 --> 01:20:39.466
Stop, stop, stop. Farhang!

01:20:39.468 --> 01:20:42.102
- What do you...
- Nothing, nothing, nothing!

01:20:42.104 --> 01:20:44.238
Stop! Please, stop.

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.773
Are you filming me
while you're telling me

01:20:45.775 --> 01:20:48.008
that you're not fucking
gonna film me anymore?!

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:49.410
Are you kidding me?!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:20:49.412 --> 01:20:50.945
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:20:50.947 --> 01:20:52.346
Please, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:55.149
You're fucking-you're fucking
lying to me, right?

01:20:55.151 --> 01:20:56.817
You just said
that you're not filming,

01:20:56.819 --> 01:20:58.118
and you said no more filming,

01:20:58.120 --> 01:20:59.553
and you're fucking filming me
right now?

01:20:59.555 --> 01:21:00.888
I wanted to film something fun.

01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:03.390
I just wanted to film
something fun. Come here.

01:21:03.392 --> 01:21:05.025
What did you want to film, huh?

01:21:05.027 --> 01:21:06.560
What did you want to film?

01:21:07.495 --> 01:21:10.397
Remember what you first
wanted to film?

01:21:10.399 --> 01:21:12.833
Right? Right?

01:21:26.214 --> 01:21:28.182
Are you gonna stop
fucking filming me?

01:21:28.184 --> 01:21:28.182
Huh?

01:21:28.184 --> 01:21:31.919
Are you gonna stop
fucking lying to me?

01:21:31.921 --> 01:21:33.187
You're gonna stop lying to me.

01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:34.588
- Mmh.
- Yeah.

01:21:36.391 --> 01:21:38.425
You're gonna fucking stop.
You better fucking stop.

01:21:38.427 --> 01:21:40.094
Farhang, no!

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:42.730
<i>Jennifer.</i>

01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:49.703
<i>All our lives
have just been so...</i>

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:55.209
<i>So much together, and...</i>

01:21:56.811 --> 01:21:58.879
<i>You know, one of the things
that's interesting?</i>

01:21:58.881 --> 01:22:00.381
<i>It's the oldest friends</i>

01:22:00.383 --> 01:22:02.850
<i>that in most cases
last the longest.</i>

01:22:03.985 --> 01:22:06.887
<i>Oh, you got another one!</i>

01:22:06.889 --> 01:22:08.322
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:10.925
<i>That's it, Jennifer.</i>

01:22:10.927 --> 01:22:13.294
<i>You just carry it in there.
That's it, kid.</i>

01:22:13.296 --> 01:22:14.628
<i>Move it.</i>

01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:19.400
<i>That's right.
Light up a cigarette.</i>

01:22:21.236 --> 01:22:22.703
<i>Jennifer!</i>

01:22:26.342 --> 01:22:27.841
<i>Yes.</i>

01:22:30.278 --> 01:22:31.278
<i>Good job.</i>

01:22:37.519 --> 01:22:39.153
Hello.

01:22:42.191 --> 01:22:44.491
1983.

01:22:44.493 --> 01:22:47.328
Good thing my mom didn't
throw out this camera.

01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:50.931
And hopefully...
Farhang won't break you.

01:22:50.933 --> 01:22:53.300
To make up for the loss
of my old toy,

01:22:53.302 --> 01:22:56.470
I've got... a new one.

01:22:59.241 --> 01:23:00.908
This is gonna be so much fun.

01:23:03.445 --> 01:23:04.478
Yo!

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.046
Testing, one, two, three.

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:09.016
We're here to give...

01:23:10.118 --> 01:23:11.852
mr. rich man...

01:23:11.854 --> 01:23:15.789
and his girlfriend...
A bit of a surprise.

01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:17.157
A shock, if you will.

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:18.892
But you're gonna wait here
and watch from a distance.

01:23:18.894 --> 01:23:20.260
So don't blink.

01:23:49.557 --> 01:23:50.724
Hi.
- Hi.

01:23:50.726 --> 01:23:52.426
I'm sorry to bother you,
but, um,

01:23:52.428 --> 01:23:54.194
I lost my cat
a little while back

01:23:54.196 --> 01:23:55.629
and I'm just in the area

01:23:55.631 --> 01:23:57.765
and I wasn't sure if anybody
maybe had seen him

01:23:57.767 --> 01:23:57.765
or picked him up.
- Who's at the door?

01:23:57.767 --> 01:24:00.534
No I haven't.
It's just someone here.

01:24:00.536 --> 01:24:02.403
No, he's really sweet and small

01:24:02.405 --> 01:24:03.837
and he's black and white.

01:24:03.839 --> 01:24:05.539
- I haven't seen him.
- No?

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:06.740
No, I'm sorry.

01:24:06.742 --> 01:24:07.841
Geez, I'm sorry to bother you,

01:24:07.843 --> 01:24:09.243
has anybody in the house
maybe seen him?

01:24:09.245 --> 01:24:10.878
Did you see a cat, hun?

01:24:11.981 --> 01:24:13.180
No, fuck that.

01:24:14.549 --> 01:24:16.016
What's all the noise over there?

01:24:16.018 --> 01:24:17.384
Who the fuck are you?
What...

01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:18.585
Remember me?

01:24:18.587 --> 01:24:19.753
Do I know you?

01:24:20.956 --> 01:24:23.290
Who's the cunt now?

01:24:44.312 --> 01:24:47.347
Geez, how long are you guys
gonna be out? Wake up.

01:24:47.349 --> 01:24:49.016
Hey, wake up.

01:24:49.018 --> 01:24:50.451
Hey, wake up!

01:24:50.453 --> 01:24:52.920
Hello!
Morning, sunshine.

01:24:52.922 --> 01:24:54.488
Richy, shut up. Shut up.

01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:55.622
You!

01:24:55.624 --> 01:24:56.623
Yeah, me. Remember me?

01:24:56.625 --> 01:24:57.658
- Bitch!
- Hi!

01:24:57.660 --> 01:24:58.926
Bitch, sure!
- Fuck you!

01:24:58.928 --> 01:25:00.260
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up!

01:25:00.262 --> 01:25:02.129
I will hit you in the head
with this fucking hammer!

01:25:02.131 --> 01:25:04.331
I will cave
your fucking head in.

01:25:05.768 --> 01:25:08.902
That's better.
Shh. Sh-sh-sh.

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:14.074
Sh-sh-sh. Hey, hey, hey,
I brought you a present.

01:25:14.076 --> 01:25:16.043
Take a look around,
you have company.

01:25:16.045 --> 01:25:17.377
Why?

01:25:17.379 --> 01:25:19.079
- Yeah.
- Fuck!

01:25:19.081 --> 01:25:20.848
You picked a good one, though.
She looks fantastic.

01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:23.283
She is gorgeous.
Look at that.

01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:25.719
Do you know what she looks like
with a ball gag in her mouth?

01:25:27.155 --> 01:25:30.023
Trophy wife
and a trophy girlfriend.

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:32.626
Get your hair so we can see
that pretty face.

01:25:32.628 --> 01:25:33.961
Don't touch her!

01:25:41.469 --> 01:25:43.203
Got a little excited there.

01:25:45.941 --> 01:25:48.575
And... wake... up!

01:25:48.577 --> 01:25:51.979
Sweetheart, you got a needle...
There's a needle in your neck,

01:25:51.981 --> 01:25:53.180
and if you move around too much,

01:25:53.182 --> 01:25:54.481
I might push the plunger

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:55.649
and I don't really know
exactly what's gonna happen

01:25:55.651 --> 01:25:57.484
with cleaning fluid
in the human body.

01:25:57.486 --> 01:25:59.720
Has he told you he loves you,
sweetheart?

01:25:59.722 --> 01:26:02.656
Aw, that's so sweet.

01:26:02.658 --> 01:26:05.192
Do you love her more
than you love your wife?

01:26:05.194 --> 01:26:06.827
Probably. I dunno.

01:26:06.829 --> 01:26:08.795
Do you love her more
than you love yourself?

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:13.300
'Cause I don't-i don't need
to plunge both of you.

01:26:13.302 --> 01:26:14.902
Would you rather...

01:26:14.904 --> 01:26:17.738
I take this needle
out of her neck,

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:20.607
stick you with it,
and let her walk away?

01:26:20.609 --> 01:26:22.376
Do you love her that much?

01:26:22.378 --> 01:26:24.545
Or would rather I let you go

01:26:24.547 --> 01:26:26.246
and I will stick her instead?

01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:30.884
Give me the go ahead
and you can walk outta here.

01:26:30.886 --> 01:26:33.220
Give me a nod.
I just wanna know it's okay.

01:26:34.223 --> 01:26:35.789
You gonna save yourself?

01:26:36.891 --> 01:26:37.958
Yeah?

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:40.360
Wow, that took a lot less
effort than I fucking thought.

01:26:40.362 --> 01:26:42.082
Sorry, sweetheart.
You picked the wrong guy.

01:26:51.907 --> 01:26:53.640
Holy shit.

01:26:53.642 --> 01:26:55.475
Rich, are you getting this?

01:26:56.678 --> 01:26:58.045
Shit.

01:27:03.419 --> 01:27:05.085
Is that upsetting?

01:27:05.087 --> 01:27:06.887
Hey?

01:27:06.889 --> 01:27:08.322
Hey, suit man!

01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:10.390
Hey.

01:27:10.392 --> 01:27:12.092
That's gotta be
pretty traumatizing for you.

01:27:12.094 --> 01:27:13.994
She died right on your back.

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:16.296
And right on your word.

01:27:16.298 --> 01:27:18.832
Are you seriously fucking
crying and drooling

01:27:18.834 --> 01:27:20.834
like a fucking baby?

01:27:20.836 --> 01:27:22.569
Fucking bitch!

01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:24.871
Fuckin'... I... I...

01:27:24.873 --> 01:27:24.871
Given the circumstances,

01:27:24.873 --> 01:27:29.176
I don't think I'm the bitch
in this room right now.

01:27:33.315 --> 01:27:36.750
I didn't even think you were
capable of producing tears!

01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:38.518
You must have really liked her.

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:40.220
Not nearly as much
as you like your-fucking-self,

01:27:40.222 --> 01:27:41.488
you piece of shit.

01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:44.658
You worthless piece
of fucking shit!

01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:47.194
You did this yourself!

01:27:54.369 --> 01:27:55.369
Fuck...

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.173
Let me go...

01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:03.877
Let me go! Let me go!

01:28:03.879 --> 01:28:07.414
You want to go home...
To your wife?

01:28:07.416 --> 01:28:10.117
Or, you know, we could actually
bring her into the party.

01:28:10.119 --> 01:28:11.818
Have the two of them ever met?

01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:13.754
- Fucking no!
- Have those two ever met?

01:28:13.756 --> 01:28:15.222
Let me go!

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:18.091
Would you prefer me
to use the...

01:28:18.093 --> 01:28:20.227
hammer or the syringe on her?

01:28:21.463 --> 01:28:22.829
Hey, I'm home.

01:28:22.831 --> 01:28:25.999
Shh, shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

01:28:26.001 --> 01:28:27.567
Do you want to get out of here?

01:28:27.569 --> 01:28:29.403
Do you want to get out of here?

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:31.972
Then not another goddamn word

01:28:31.974 --> 01:28:35.108
or I will smash your fucking head
in with this fucking hammer.

01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:36.176
Good boy.

01:28:36.178 --> 01:28:38.478
You sit tight.
I will be right back.

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:39.613
Hey, I'm home.

01:28:39.615 --> 01:28:41.148
Hey!

01:28:41.150 --> 01:28:43.116
Hey, babe, I'm downstairs!

01:28:43.118 --> 01:28:44.651
Sweetie?

01:28:44.653 --> 01:28:46.019
Honey, I'm downstairs.

01:28:46.021 --> 01:28:48.288
Come on down, come on down.
I have a surprise for you.

01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:48.288
Hey!

01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:51.291
- What the fuck is that?
- It's a camera!

01:28:51.293 --> 01:28:51.291
You bought another camera?

01:28:51.293 --> 01:28:53.327
Come here, I have something
to show you.

01:28:53.329 --> 01:28:53.327
You bought another
fucking camera?

01:28:53.329 --> 01:28:53.327
Come here, come here.
I'm gonna show you.

01:28:53.329 --> 01:28:53.327
No, seriously,
I thought this was over.

01:28:53.329 --> 01:28:58.832
I smashed the first fucking camera
and I'll break this one too!

01:28:58.834 --> 01:29:00.434
You're not gonna touch
this fucking...

01:29:00.436 --> 01:29:02.002
- Did you fucking buy that camera?
- - No!

01:29:02.004 --> 01:29:03.270
What the fuck is going on?

01:29:03.272 --> 01:29:05.305
We can fix it, babe.

01:29:05.307 --> 01:29:06.473
What the fuck is wrong with her?

01:29:06.475 --> 01:29:06.473
What's wrong with her?
She's dead.

01:29:06.475 --> 01:29:09.109
That's what's wrong with her.
- Oh, my god.

01:29:09.111 --> 01:29:10.444
It's not like you don't know
what this looks like.

01:29:10.446 --> 01:29:11.878
What the fuck are you doing?

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:13.046
Do you remember the guy
that I told you about

01:29:13.048 --> 01:29:15.716
that we were supposed to kill,
not Gary? I got him.

01:29:15.718 --> 01:29:17.684
What the fuck are you doing?!

01:29:17.686 --> 01:29:19.419
- We killed Gary first.
- You can't fucking...

01:29:19.421 --> 01:29:21.822
Get these fucking people
out of my fucking house!

01:29:21.824 --> 01:29:24.057
Get these people out of my house!
I can't fucking do this!

01:29:24.059 --> 01:29:24.057
I cannot do this!

01:29:24.059 --> 01:29:27.794
- We have to do this right!
- Get that thing outta my face!

01:29:27.796 --> 01:29:29.663
We have to
do this right, farhang.

01:29:29.665 --> 01:29:32.833
I just want to do this right
and then it'll be like before.

01:29:32.835 --> 01:29:33.867
It'll be fine.

01:29:33.869 --> 01:29:35.035
- No, it won't.
- Yes, it will.

01:29:35.037 --> 01:29:36.069
No, it won't.

01:29:36.071 --> 01:29:38.004
Get these fucking people
out of our house.

01:29:38.006 --> 01:29:39.239
This is our house.

01:29:39.241 --> 01:29:41.842
This piece of shit
deserves to die, farhang.

01:29:41.844 --> 01:29:43.343
- No, he doesn't.
- Yes, he does!

01:29:43.345 --> 01:29:45.045
Who the fuck are you
to decide that?

01:29:45.047 --> 01:29:47.147
This guy killed Gary.

01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:48.482
You killed Gary!

01:29:48.484 --> 01:29:49.616
No, we killed Gary.

01:29:49.618 --> 01:29:50.717
You fucking killed, Gary.

01:29:50.719 --> 01:29:51.985
We killed Gary.

01:29:51.987 --> 01:29:53.653
And it's the asshole's fault.

01:29:54.623 --> 01:29:56.123
I did everything for you.

01:29:56.125 --> 01:29:57.824
No, that's not true.

01:29:57.826 --> 01:29:59.926
This would be doing everything.
And then it'll be better.

01:29:59.928 --> 01:30:01.528
Get that out of my face.
I did everything for you.

01:30:01.530 --> 01:30:02.763
It'll be better
if you just do it.

01:30:02.765 --> 01:30:04.531
I can't, no.
I can't fucking do this.

01:30:04.533 --> 01:30:05.899
I can't do this.
- Farhang, come back.

01:30:05.901 --> 01:30:07.434
Come here, please.
- I won't.

01:30:07.436 --> 01:30:08.568
I won't fucking do this.
- Please.

01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:10.237
I won't fucking do this.

01:30:10.239 --> 01:30:12.973
I fucking did this for you.
I did all of the fucking things

01:30:12.975 --> 01:30:15.142
that you fucking asked me
to do for us.

01:30:15.144 --> 01:30:16.877
Please, we just need
to do it right

01:30:16.879 --> 01:30:16.877
and it will go away.
- Jen, what about me?

01:30:16.879 --> 01:30:20.213
- We need to do it right... - what're
you gonna fucking do for me?

01:30:20.215 --> 01:30:20.213
What?

01:30:20.215 --> 01:30:22.682
Because of this asshole,
we had to kill Gary.

01:30:22.684 --> 01:30:22.682
Because of this piece of shit.

01:30:22.684 --> 01:30:25.685
Because of you we had to fucking kill Gary!
That was you!

01:30:25.687 --> 01:30:28.755
You're the fucking worst thing that's
ever fucking happened in my life!

01:30:28.757 --> 01:30:30.357
Get that out of my fucking face.

01:30:30.359 --> 01:30:32.058
- You need to do it!
- Get that out of my face!

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:33.960
I will fucking call the police!

01:30:33.962 --> 01:30:35.262
You won't call
the fucking police.

01:30:35.264 --> 01:30:37.297
Yes, I will!
Fucking try me!

01:30:37.299 --> 01:30:39.633
Listen to him.
You can hear for yourself.

01:30:39.635 --> 01:30:41.401
Why don't you tell him
what a piece of shit you are?

01:30:41.403 --> 01:30:41.401
I don't know what I did.
I don't know.

01:30:41.403 --> 01:30:44.671
You don't fucking know,
you lying piece of shit.

01:30:44.673 --> 01:30:46.506
Come on, untie me.
Let me go, man.

01:30:46.508 --> 01:30:47.674
He's not gonna help you.

01:30:47.676 --> 01:30:49.810
Farhang, this piece of shit,

01:30:49.812 --> 01:30:51.978
that is cheating on his wife
with that woman.

01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:55.715
Shut up! Don't listen to her.
She's a fucking crazy bitch.

01:30:55.717 --> 01:30:59.152
Okay? Just kill him,
and everything will be fine.

01:30:59.154 --> 01:31:01.521
- You want money?
- - Just kill him, and everything will be fine.

01:31:01.523 --> 01:31:03.089
Can you fucking not do this?

01:31:03.091 --> 01:31:06.560
- No.
- I did everything I fucking had to do!

01:31:06.562 --> 01:31:07.828
Shut the fuck up!

01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:09.729
Listen to him, listen to him.

01:31:09.731 --> 01:31:13.633
- Please just do this.
- - Please, listen to him, you crazy bitch!

01:31:13.635 --> 01:31:15.602
Fuck you!

01:31:16.304 --> 01:31:18.672
Farhang, let go!
Let go! Farhang!

01:31:18.674 --> 01:31:20.574
