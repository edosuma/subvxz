KNOW THAT.

00:45.875 --> 00:47.000
YOU ALMOST DELIVERED

LOOK, SCOTT'S A GREAT GUY,

GOOD MORNING.

WHO JUST DELIVERED.

BUT I'D APPRECIATE A CONSULT.

01:55.083 --> 01:56.875
I'M SLAMMED AT THE MOMENT.
CAN IT WAIT TILL THIS AFTERNOON?

01:56.917 --> 01:57.959
WHATEVER YOU CAN SPARE.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.500
HEY, HEY. IT WAS,
UH, REALLY GREAT

I HAD NO IDEA YOU HAD
A STEPDAUGHTER.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.250
YEAH?

02:06.291 --> 02:08.250
DO YOU--DO YOU--YOU GET
TO SEE HER OFTEN?

02:08.291 --> 02:10.542
NOT OFTEN ENOUGH.
I MISS HER.

BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S--
IT'S COOL.

02:12.083 --> 02:14.041

WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN LIFE.

02:15.417 --> 02:18.125

YOU WERE PRETTY NEAT, TOO.

02:18.166 --> 02:19.542
(Pete) HEY.

02:19.583 --> 02:20.959
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
GO RUNNING THIS MORNING.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.125
I'M SORRY. I JUST WASN'T
FEELING UP TO IT.

02:22.166 --> 02:23.750
WHAT HAPPENED?
THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU.

02:23.792 --> 02:24.959

02:47.417 --> 02:48.959
SHE'S WITH SCOTT.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.166
NO, SHE'S NOT. ACCORDING TO
THE NURSES, THAT'S DONE.

02:51.208 --> 02:53.041

02:53.083 --> 02:55.125

ELISE?

02:55.166 --> 02:58.417
(people speaking indistinctly)

02:58.458 --> 02:59.917
YOU KNOW, THE LAST TIME
I WAS HERE,

02:59.959 --> 03:01.208
WE DIDN'T GET VERY FAR,

03:01.250 --> 03:04.041
AND I WAS HOPING TODAY, YOU'D
LIKE TO SHARE A LITTLE MORE.

03:04.083 --> 03:06.041
I KNOW IT'S PAINFUL,

03:06.083 --> 03:08.750
BUT I TRULY BELIEVE THAT
TALKING ABOUT IT WILL HELP.

03:08.792 --> 03:10.041
YOU CAN'T HELP ME.

03:10.083 --> 03:12.041
I'D LIKE TO TRY.

03:12.083 --> 03:14.333
YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW I FEEL TODAY?

03:14.375 --> 03:18.375
THE SAME AS EVERY DAY.
I FEEL LIKE I'M A MONSTER.

03:20.458 --> 03:22.208
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE A MONSTER.

03:26.375 --> 03:28.834
I MURDERED
MY TWO CHILDREN.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.083
WHAT WOULD YOU CALL ME?

03:39.667 --> 03:41.041
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

03:41.083 --> 03:42.041
HEY.

03:42.083 --> 03:43.625
HEY. I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO PAGE YOU.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.041
I'VE GOT ABOUT ANOTHER
15 MINUTES

03:45.083 --> 03:46.709
BEFORE I HEAD TO THE O.R.
FOR A C-SECTION.

03:46.750 --> 03:49.083
BET I COULD DO
AN ULTRASOUND.

03:49.125 --> 03:50.500
OH, UH, YEAH.

03:50.542 --> 03:52.083
I'M WAY BEHIND TODAY.

03:52.125 --> 03:53.291
I'LL BE QUICK.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.291
I'LL EVEN WARM UP
THE GEL FOR YOU.

03:55.333 --> 03:56.792
ANOTHER TIME.

03:56.834 --> 03:58.500
AMELIA...
YOU REALLY SHOULD DO THIS.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.417
SO I CAN SEE EVERYTHING
THAT IS WRONG WITH MY BABY--

04:00.458 --> 04:02.041
THE HORNS STICKING OUT
OF ITS HEAD...

04:02.083 --> 04:04.041
(laughs)
ITS LONG CORKSCREW TAIL?

04:04.083 --> 04:06.041
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE FREAKED OUT,
BUT PART OF IT

04:06.083 --> 04:08.667
IS BECAUSE NONE OF THIS
IS REAL FOR YOU YET.

04:08.709 --> 04:11.041
BUT AS SOON AS YOU SEE IT
ON THE ULTRASOUND

04:11.083 --> 04:13.291
AND YOU HEAR THE HEARTBEAT,
IT'S ALL GONNA CHANGE FOR YOU.

04:13.333 --> 04:14.542
IT'S GONNA BE REAL.

04:14.583 --> 04:16.041
I'LL DO IT TOMORROW,
OKAY?

04:16.083 --> 04:18.041
ALL RIGHT. YOU'VE GOT
ABOUT ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES

04:18.083 --> 04:20.417
BEFORE THOSE BAGGY SWEATERS
AREN'T GONNA HIDE THAT BUMP.

04:20.458 --> 04:23.041
HEY. THIS IS A GOOD THING.

04:23.083 --> 04:26.041

04:33.458 --> 04:34.834
ME, TOO.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.041
UH, YOU WANT TO GO TO
THE BREAKFAST BURRITO PLACE

04:36.083 --> 04:37.417
DOWN AT THE PIER OR...

04:37.458 --> 04:39.417
IT'S A SCHOOL DAY.
I DON'T WANT TO BE LATE.

04:39.458 --> 04:40.834

I THINK SHE'D UNDERSTAND.

04:45.083 --> 04:47.041

I COULD PLAY HOOKY FROM WORK,

04:47.083 --> 04:49.041
AND WE COULD
GO DO SOMETHING FUN.

04:49.083 --> 04:51.041
UH, UH, THAT'S OKAY.
WE COULD GO FISHING.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.667
HEY, IF I
EAT SOME CEREAL FAST,

04:52.709 --> 04:54.041
COULD YOU DRIVE ME
SO I'M NOT LATE FOR MATH?

04:54.083 --> 04:55.500
YEAH, OF COURSE.

04:55.542 --> 04:56.959
COOL.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.750

PICTURE OF YOU FOR MY PHONE.

05:01.792 --> 05:03.041

05:19.083 --> 05:20.959
HE'S...

05:21.000 --> 05:23.041
(labored breathing) GOING...

05:23.083 --> 05:25.291
GOING TO SCHOOL?

05:25.333 --> 05:27.041
MM-HMM.

05:27.083 --> 05:29.291
GOOD.

05:29.333 --> 05:33.041
I COULD HAVE COOP
BRING HIM BY THIS AFTERNOON.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.041
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:35.083 --> 05:36.083
NO.

05:36.125 --> 05:38.625
IT MIGHT BE GOOD,
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

05:38.667 --> 05:40.709
I SAID NO.

05:40.750 --> 05:42.291
DON'T...

05:42.333 --> 05:43.917
ARGUE...

05:43.959 --> 05:45.959

05:50.083 --> 05:51.166
(elevator bell dings)

05:51.208 --> 05:54.041
(indistinct conversations)

05:54.083 --> 05:55.333

05:55.375 --> 05:57.041

06:03.500 --> 06:05.041
THE PROSECUTORS JUST TOLD ME

06:05.083 --> 06:08.041
THAT ELISE'S LAWYERS ARE

06:08.083 --> 06:09.458

06:09.500 --> 06:11.458
YOU'RE MY DOCTOR, TOO.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.875
YOU GAVE US A FAMILY,

06:12.917 --> 06:14.041
AND NOW YOU'RE HELPING
THE WOMAN WHO TOOK IT AWAY?

06:14.083 --> 06:15.458
ELISE WAS ON SUICIDE WATCH.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.583
I ONLY ASKED DR. WALLACE
TO TALK TO HER.

06:17.625 --> 06:19.375
DO YOU REMEMBER JOSIE?

06:19.417 --> 06:21.041
SHE HAD RED HAIR AND FRECKLES.

06:21.083 --> 06:22.792
SHE WAS 4.

06:22.834 --> 06:24.375
MAX WAS 2.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.041
STILL IN DIAPERS.

06:26.083 --> 06:27.917
THEY WERE AWAKE.

06:27.959 --> 06:31.041
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN
SO SCARED.

06:31.083 --> 06:35.041
MY WIFE MURDERED
OUR CHILDREN.

06:35.083 --> 06:38.375
SHE SHOULD ROT IN JAIL.

06:38.417 --> 06:40.041
AND YOU SHOULD BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELF

06:40.083 --> 06:42.041
FOR HELPING HER AT ALL.

06:46.083 --> 06:47.041
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO ASKED ME

06:47.083 --> 06:48.250
TO TALK TO ELISE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

06:48.291 --> 06:49.458
SHE WAS IN JAIL AND SUICIDAL.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.667
I ASKED YOU TO HELP
WITH HER MENTAL STATE,

06:50.709 --> 06:51.875
NOT TO WORK TO SET HER FREE.

06:51.917 --> 06:53.041
WHAT ELISE DID
WAS HORRIFIC.

06:53.083 --> 06:54.250
IT WAS BEYOND HORRIFIC.

06:54.291 --> 06:56.375
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE HAD
A PSYCHOTIC EPISODE,

06:56.417 --> 06:58.500
BROUGHT ON BY AN UNDIAGNOSED
POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION.

06:58.542 --> 07:00.041
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT,
BUT YOU SHOULD'VE COME TO ME

07:00.083 --> 07:01.750
BEFORE YOU AGREED
TO HELP HER OUT.

07:01.792 --> 07:04.500
I'M NOT TRYING TO JUSTIFY
WHAT SHE DID.

07:04.542 --> 07:06.208
I'M TRYING TO SHED LIGHT
ON WHAT HAPPENED.

07:06.250 --> 07:08.041
RIGHT, AND THE EFFECT OF THAT
COULD BE A COURT

07:08.083 --> 07:09.458
SETTING THAT WOMAN FREE.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.834
(Addison) OKAY, POSTPARTUM

07:10.875 --> 07:12.875
IS A REAL THING, ALL RIGHT?

07:12.917 --> 07:15.041
JAKE, 80% OF MOTHERS SUFFER
FROM SOME FORM OF IT.

07:15.083 --> 07:16.834
YEAH, BUT THEY DON'T ASPHYXIATE
THEIR OWN CHILDREN.

07:16.875 --> 07:19.041
SAM, YOU KNOW HOW BRUTAL
MENTAL ILLNESS CAN BE.

07:19.083 --> 07:20.083
THIS IS
A KIND OF MENTAL ILLNESS.

07:20.125 --> 07:22.458
LOOK, GUYS,
THIS IS ABOUT ELISE.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.041
SHELDON, YOU CAN HELP HER
ALL YOU WANT,

07:24.083 --> 07:25.417
JUST DON'T DEFEND
WHAT SHE DID IN COURT.

07:25.458 --> 07:27.417
YES, WELL, I'M SORRY, JAKE,
BUT SHE'S MY PATIENT NOW.

07:27.458 --> 07:29.709
OKAY? YOU DON'T GET
TO MAKE THAT CALL.

07:31.083 --> 07:32.333
(exhales deeply)

07:32.375 --> 07:34.333
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

07:34.375 --> 07:37.375
(indistinct conversations)

07:41.083 --> 07:42.875
HEY, YOU OKAY?

07:42.917 --> 07:46.542
UH... I'M FINE. YEAH.

07:46.583 --> 07:48.375
HOW MUCH LONGER
DOES SHE HAVE?

07:48.417 --> 07:50.291
I DON'T KNOW.

07:50.333 --> 07:52.500
DAYS MAYBE, BUT...

07:52.542 --> 07:54.041
IT'S STILL, UH...

07:54.083 --> 07:55.166
TOO LONG.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.750
I'M WEARING DOWN.

07:57.792 --> 08:00.083
WELL, BECAUSE...

08:00.125 --> 08:01.375
SHE'S NOT JUST A PATIENT.

08:01.417 --> 08:02.750
SHE'S IN YOUR LIFE,

08:02.792 --> 08:04.500
WHICH MEANS YOU CAN'T GET
ANY EMOTIONAL DISTANCE.

08:04.542 --> 08:06.041
AND WITHOUT THAT,
YOU'RE NOT A DOCTOR ANYMORE.

08:06.083 --> 08:07.667
YOU'RE...

08:07.709 --> 08:09.709
WELL...

08:09.750 --> 08:11.917
YOU'RE FAMILY.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.208
(indistinct conversations
continue)

08:13.250 --> 08:15.500
I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO DO THIS.

08:15.542 --> 08:17.834
(blows air)

08:17.875 --> 08:20.625
THERE'S NO RIGHT WAY
TO DO IT.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.792
JUST...

08:22.834 --> 08:24.917
BE THERE.

08:24.959 --> 08:27.417
(indistinct conversations
continue)

08:27.458 --> 08:30.250
COOPER'S WITH MASON.

08:32.083 --> 08:35.083
AND I...

08:35.125 --> 08:36.917
I...

08:36.959 --> 08:40.000
(sighs deeply)

08:48.041 --> 08:51.417
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:51.458 --> 08:53.542
(inhales)

08:53.583 --> 08:55.041
(exhales deeply)

08:55.083 --> 08:58.041
CURT AND ELISE CAME TO ME
THREE YEARS AGO.

08:58.083 --> 09:01.834
THEY ALREADY HAD
A LITTLE GIRL--JOSIE.

09:01.875 --> 09:05.208
BUT THEY HAD TROUBLE
CONCEIVING AGAIN, SO...

09:05.250 --> 09:08.041
AFTER TWO ROUNDS OF I.V.F.,
THEY HAD MAX.

09:08.083 --> 09:10.333
AFTER ANOTHER YEAR,
THEY, UH...

09:10.375 --> 09:12.000
(clears throat)

09:12.041 --> 09:16.208
THEY SAID THEY WERE READY
FOR A THIRD.

09:16.250 --> 09:20.041
THAT ONE TOOK A LITTLE LONGER,
BUT, UM...

09:20.083 --> 09:22.041
EVERY TIME ELISE
CAME INTO THE OFFICE,

09:22.083 --> 09:24.041
CURT WOULD COME WITH HER.

09:24.083 --> 09:26.667
THEY'D BRING THE KIDS.

09:26.709 --> 09:29.625
I REMEMBER, UH...

09:29.667 --> 09:32.291
ELISE SEEMED A LITTLE OFF.

09:32.333 --> 09:35.041
BUT WITH TWO KIDS AND--AND MORE
FERTILITY TREATMENTS,

09:35.083 --> 09:37.458
I-I FIGURED,
SHE WAS OVERWHELMED

09:37.500 --> 09:39.041
AND AFFECTED BY THE HORMONES,

09:39.083 --> 09:41.041
BUT SHE SAID
SHE COULD HANDLE IT.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.875
MY JOB
IS TO GIVE PEOPLE BABIES,

09:43.917 --> 09:47.000
NOT JUDGE WHETHER
THEY SHOULD BE PARENTS.

09:49.959 --> 09:51.750
SO I...

09:53.291 --> 09:54.834
I HELPED ELISE

09:54.875 --> 09:56.458
TO GET PREGNANT AGAIN.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.750
THERE'S NO WAY ANYONE
COULD'VE KNOWN

09:58.792 --> 10:00.458
WHAT ELISE WAS GOING TO DO.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.041
BUT I WAS HER DOCTOR.

10:02.083 --> 10:04.333
I MEAN, I COULD'VE...

10:04.375 --> 10:06.291
I COULD'VE BEEN
MORE TUNED IN,

10:06.333 --> 10:07.500
COULD'VE ASKED MORE QUESTIONS.

10:07.542 --> 10:09.917
BUT INSTEAD, I SHOT HER UP
WITH FERTILITY DRUGS

10:09.959 --> 10:11.625
AND PROBABLY MADE
THE PROBLEM WORSE.

10:11.667 --> 10:13.875
JAKE...

10:13.917 --> 10:15.625
YOU DIDN'T CAUSE THIS.

10:15.667 --> 10:17.875
YOU HAVE NO IDEA THE EFFECT
THAT MEDICATION HAD ON HER.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.875
EXCEPT I KNOW
THAT I MADE IT POSSIBLE

10:19.917 --> 10:21.709
FOR HER TO HAVE
ANOTHER BABY.

10:21.750 --> 10:24.041
BECAUSE OF ME, THIS WOMAN

10:24.083 --> 10:26.959
WHO KILLED HER TWO CHILDREN

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
IS ABOUT TO HAVE ANOTHER.

10:32.208 --> 10:34.500
ALL RIGHT, SPELLING.
YOU OBVIOUSLY NAILED THAT.

10:34.542 --> 10:36.166
YEAH.

10:36.208 --> 10:38.125
MATH, YOU GOT 8 OUT OF 10.

10:38.166 --> 10:40.166
WHAT ABOUT
THE OTHER 2 POINTS?

10:40.208 --> 10:42.125
KIDDING.

10:42.166 --> 10:43.750
GOOD JOB
ON YOUR HISTORY.

10:43.792 --> 10:46.041
AND A DRAWING...

10:46.083 --> 10:48.083
DO YOU LIKE IT?
YEAH.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.500
YOU AND YOUR MOM?

10:49.542 --> 10:51.583
WHENEVER I'M SCARED,
SHE LETS ME GET IN HER BED.

10:51.625 --> 10:53.166
THEN I'M NOT SCARED ANYMORE.

10:53.208 --> 10:55.959
THAT'S GREAT.
THAT IS A GREAT DRAWING.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.750
I WAS THINKING MAYBE YOU COULD
HELP ME FIND A FRAME FOR IT,

10:58.792 --> 11:02.083
AND WE CAN PUT IT IN HER ROOM
FOR WHEN SHE COMES HOME.

11:02.125 --> 11:04.041
MASE...

11:04.083 --> 11:05.792
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.
SHE'S NOT--

11:05.834 --> 11:07.709
SHE'S...
SHE'S NOT COMING HOME.

11:07.750 --> 11:08.917
SHE'S DYING.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.375
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
LAST TIME IN SEATTLE,

11:10.417 --> 11:12.000
BUT THEN THE DOCTORS
FIXED HER.

11:12.041 --> 11:13.917
RIGHT, BUT, MASON...

11:13.959 --> 11:18.041
(sighs) THEY CAN'T HELP
YOUR MOM THERE ANYMORE.

11:18.083 --> 11:19.875
NOBODY CAN.

11:21.625 --> 11:23.000
SOMEBODY WILL.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.041
(buzzer sounds)

11:28.083 --> 11:30.041
(hinges squeak)

11:30.083 --> 11:31.542
WHY ARE YOU BACK?

11:31.583 --> 11:32.875
I WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE.

11:32.917 --> 11:34.458
I WANT TO TRY TO HELP
WITH YOUR DEFENSE,

11:34.500 --> 11:37.041
BUT TO DO THAT,
YOU HAVE TO TALK TO ME.

11:37.083 --> 11:39.041
I DON'T DESERVE YOUR HELP.

11:39.083 --> 11:41.959
ELISE, YOU HAVE TO GET
BEYOND THE SELF-CONDEMNATION

11:42.000 --> 11:44.041
AND OPEN UP.

11:44.083 --> 11:46.250
DON'T YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:46.291 --> 11:48.208
(keys jangle)

11:48.250 --> 11:51.250
(people speaking indistinctly)

11:54.083 --> 11:57.875
CURT WAS OUT--OUT OF TOWN
ON BUSINESS THAT WEEK.

11:57.917 --> 11:59.834
MAX HAD BEEN SICK.

11:59.875 --> 12:01.542
HE WOULDN'T STOP CRYING.

12:01.583 --> 12:03.000
I TOOK HIM TO THE DOCTOR.

12:03.041 --> 12:04.500
I DID EVERYTHING
THAT THEY TOLD ME TO DO,

12:04.542 --> 12:06.834
BUT HE JUST...

12:06.875 --> 12:09.375
HE WOULDN'T STOP.

12:09.417 --> 12:11.500
JOSIE WAS UPSET BECAUSE...

12:11.542 --> 12:14.000
I COULDN'T GIVE HER
THE ATTENTION THAT SHE NEEDED.

12:14.041 --> 12:16.208
NEITHER OF THEM WOULD SLEEP.

12:16.250 --> 12:18.166
IT TOOK THEM HOURS
TO GO DOWN,

12:18.208 --> 12:20.041
AND THEN...

12:20.083 --> 12:23.041
THEY WOULD WAKE UP
OVER AND OVER AT NIGHT.

12:23.083 --> 12:25.041
I WAS EXHAUSTED.

12:25.083 --> 12:27.667
IT WAS LIKE TORTURE.

12:27.709 --> 12:29.917
AND THEN I REALIZED...

12:29.959 --> 12:31.709
THAT IT WAS MY FAULT.

12:31.750 --> 12:34.709
I HAD TO HAVE
DONE SOMETHING WRONG.

12:34.750 --> 12:38.041
(crying)
MY CHILDREN WERE...

12:38.083 --> 12:40.458
UPSET AND IN PAIN...

12:40.500 --> 12:42.417
BECAUSE I WAS A BAD MOTHER,

12:42.458 --> 12:44.834
A TERRIBLE MOTHER,

12:44.875 --> 12:48.041
WHICH MADE IT EVEN HARDER
TO WATCH THEM SUFFERING.

12:48.083 --> 12:51.041
(crying)

12:52.959 --> 12:55.542
(sniffles) SO...

12:55.583 --> 12:59.041
I TOLD THEM THAT WE WERE
GOING TO THE PARK.

12:59.083 --> 13:00.959
I GOT THEM DRESSED,

13:01.000 --> 13:02.875
AND I PUT THE SAND TOYS
IN THE BACK,

13:02.917 --> 13:05.875
AND I... I...

13:05.917 --> 13:08.041
I PUT THEM IN THEIR CAR SEATS.

13:08.083 --> 13:09.041
(sobs)

13:09.083 --> 13:11.458
AND I STARTED THE CAR.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.917
(crying)

13:12.959 --> 13:15.166
AND THEN I TOLD THEM
THAT I WAS GOING TO GO BACK

13:15.208 --> 13:17.041
AND GET THEIR SNACKS.

13:17.083 --> 13:21.000
(continues crying)

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
OHH.

13:26.709 --> 13:28.709
THE PAIN AND THE GUILT
THAT YOU FEEL NOW

13:28.750 --> 13:30.083
IS A REACTION...

13:30.125 --> 13:31.291
(continues crying)

13:31.333 --> 13:32.917
TO WHAT YOU DID.

13:32.959 --> 13:35.041
IT'S A RATIONAL REACTION.

13:35.083 --> 13:37.250
BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU,
WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED THAT NIGHT

13:37.291 --> 13:40.709
WAS SOMETHING
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

13:40.750 --> 13:42.041
I THINK YOU HAD
A PSYCHOTIC EPISODE,

13:42.083 --> 13:45.375
THE RESULT OF YEARS OF
UNTREATED POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION,

13:45.417 --> 13:47.000
COMPOUNDED BY
A HORMONAL IMBALANCE.

13:47.041 --> 13:49.291
YOU'RE NOT THE SAME WOMAN
YOU WERE THAT NIGHT.

13:49.333 --> 13:51.291
THAT NIGHT,
YOU WERE NOT RATIONAL.

13:51.333 --> 13:53.417
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT,
AND I HAVE TO HELP YOUR LAWYERS

13:53.458 --> 13:55.291
HELP THE COURT
UNDERSTAND THAT.

13:55.333 --> 13:58.000
I DON'T DESERVE YOUR HELP.
I DON'T DESERVE ANYTHING!

13:58.041 --> 14:00.041
(sobs) NO, I KILLED THEM!

14:00.083 --> 14:02.917
I KILLED MY BABIES!

14:02.959 --> 14:06.041
I KILLED THEM! OH!
(moans)

14:06.083 --> 14:08.500
(grunting)

14:08.542 --> 14:10.291
CALL 9-1-1!

14:10.333 --> 14:11.834
(continues grunting)

14:21.291 --> 14:23.041
SO HOW'S HE SEEM TO YOU?

14:23.083 --> 14:25.125
HE SEEMS LIKE A LITTLE BOY

14:25.166 --> 14:27.125
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO ACCEPT
THAT HIS MOTHER'S GONNA DIE.

14:27.166 --> 14:29.458
WE'VE BEEN AS HONEST WITH HIM
AS WE COULD BE.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.625
I KNOW.
I THOUGHT WE--
I THOUGHT HE UNDERSTOOD.

14:31.667 --> 14:33.458
KIDS MASON'S AGE
CAN'T PROCESS A TRAGEDY.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.458
THEY'LL OFTEN RESORT
TO MAGICAL THINKING.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.041
BUT HE ALREADY
SAID GOOD-BYE TO HER.

14:37.083 --> 14:38.750
HE KNOWS THAT CHARLOTTE'S
AT THE HOSPITAL WITH ERICA.

14:38.792 --> 14:41.125
HE KNOWS ERICA'S STILL ALIVE.

14:41.166 --> 14:43.834
I JUST DON'T THINK I SHOULD LET
HIM KEEP THINKING THERE'S HOPE.

14:43.875 --> 14:46.458
I THINK YOU'VE DONE
EVERYTHING YOU CAN DO.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.208
BUT...

14:48.250 --> 14:51.041
IF I DIDN'T KNOW THAT ERICA
HAD ALREADY REFUSED,

14:51.083 --> 14:53.041
I WOULD SAY,
TAKE HIM TO THE HOSPITAL.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.709
LET HIM SEE HIS MOM.
LET HER EXPLAIN.

14:54.750 --> 14:56.000
RIGHT.
I-I MEAN, I TRIED.

14:56.041 --> 14:57.875
CHARLOTTE TRIED.
ERICA WON'T BUDGE.

14:57.917 --> 14:59.250
WELL, MAYBE TAKE HIM ANYWAY.

14:59.291 --> 15:02.000
YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT
HE--HE CAN'T SEE HIS MOM,

15:02.041 --> 15:03.709
BUT AT LEAST
HE'LL BE CLOSE TO HER.

15:03.750 --> 15:05.041
THEN WHAT?

15:05.083 --> 15:06.375
AND THEN HOPE LIKE HELL
ERICA CHANGES HER MIND

15:06.417 --> 15:08.041
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

15:08.083 --> 15:10.166
(sighs)

15:10.208 --> 15:13.375
(pencil scratches paper)

15:13.417 --> 15:15.083
(coughing)

15:15.125 --> 15:17.500
OH. STOP. STOP.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.667
HUSH. YOUR MOUTH'S
LEAKING LIKE A FAUCET.

15:19.709 --> 15:20.875
(chuckles)

15:20.917 --> 15:23.041
(labored breathing)
WHO CARES?

15:23.083 --> 15:25.959
YOU WANT TO BE DROOLY, FINE.
BUT IT'S FREAKING ME OUT.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.750
I CAN'T HANDLE IT,
SISTER. (laughs)

15:27.792 --> 15:29.041
(chuckles)

15:29.083 --> 15:31.041
(coughing)

15:31.083 --> 15:33.041
OKAY. OKAY.

15:33.083 --> 15:36.125
(continues coughing)

15:36.166 --> 15:39.083
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

15:39.125 --> 15:40.500
(labored breathing)

15:40.542 --> 15:42.083
OKAY.

15:44.083 --> 15:47.041
HERE WE GO.

15:47.083 --> 15:48.750
I'M SORRY.

15:48.792 --> 15:50.917
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.000
I'M SCARED.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.041
(labored breathing
continues)

16:07.083 --> 16:10.458
I AM GONNA BE HERE WITH YOU
THE WHOLE TIME.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.125
I AM HERE.

16:12.166 --> 16:13.875
YOU'RE HERE.

16:13.917 --> 16:17.375
I'M HERE.

16:17.417 --> 16:20.417
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

16:25.083 --> 16:26.750
WHAT HAPPENED?

16:26.792 --> 16:29.000
I'M DR. MONTGOMERY,
ELISE.

16:29.041 --> 16:30.625
YOU HAD
AN ECLAMPTIC SEIZURE.

16:30.667 --> 16:32.500
MY BABY--W--
IS SHE OKAY?

16:32.542 --> 16:34.083
I DID AN ULTRASOUND,

16:34.125 --> 16:35.709
AND YOU'RE ON A FETAL MONITOR.

16:35.750 --> 16:37.083
THE BABY'S GONNA BE FINE.

16:37.125 --> 16:38.709
I PUT YOU ON MEDICATION

16:38.750 --> 16:40.083
TO GET YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE
UNDER CONTROL

16:40.125 --> 16:42.291
AND MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
HAVE ANOTHER SEIZURE.

16:42.333 --> 16:44.041
JUST AS SOON
AS YOU'RE STABLE,

16:44.083 --> 16:45.709
WE'LL GO AHEAD
AND INDUCE LABOR.

16:45.750 --> 16:46.917
HOW SOON?

16:46.959 --> 16:48.792
HOPEFULLY TOMORROW.
SHOULD BE ROUTINE.

16:48.834 --> 16:52.041
YOU'LL DELIVER VAGINALLY
UNLESS THERE'S A COMPLICATION.

16:52.083 --> 16:54.041
YOU'LL HAVE A FEW MOMENTS
WITH YOUR BABY,

16:54.083 --> 16:56.041
AND THEN SHE'LL BE
TURNED OVER TO YOUR HUSBAND.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.333
AS SOON AS YOU RECOVER,

16:57.375 --> 16:59.583
YOU'LL BE DISCHARGED
BACK TO COUNTY.

17:01.083 --> 17:03.542
THE FIRST TIME,
I WAS SO HAPPY.

17:03.583 --> 17:06.875
CURT AND I WANTED A FAMILY
SO MUCH.

17:06.917 --> 17:09.750
BUT THEY DON'T TELL YOU.
IT'S SO HARD.

17:09.792 --> 17:12.333
WANTING TO BE A MOM

17:12.375 --> 17:15.041
AND HAVING A BABY...

17:15.083 --> 17:16.875
THEY'RE DIFFERENT.

17:19.041 --> 17:23.041
MY BABIES DESERVED
SOMETHING MORE...

17:23.083 --> 17:25.583
SOMEONE BETTER THAN ME.

17:25.625 --> 17:28.875
(sighs) I TRIED MY BEST,
BUT I...

17:28.917 --> 17:30.583
(voice breaking)
I WASN'T GOOD.

17:30.625 --> 17:34.041
I WASN'T...
A GOOD MOTHER.

17:34.083 --> 17:36.917
AND THEN, I--
AND THEN I BECAME...

17:42.542 --> 17:46.291
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

17:46.333 --> 17:48.667
(people speaking indistinctly)

17:48.709 --> 17:50.041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
SO LATE?

17:50.083 --> 17:52.458
I WAS JUST, UH, SIGNING OFF
ON A PATIENT DISCHARGE.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.041
WELL, I-I'D INVITE YOU
FOR A CUP OF COFFEE,

17:54.083 --> 17:55.458
BUT I GOTTA GET BACK
TO THE E.R. SOON.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.083
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO. I JUST
STOPPED BY TO SAY HELLO.

17:57.125 --> 17:58.500
SO HELLO.

17:58.542 --> 18:00.041
HI.

18:00.083 --> 18:02.834
M-MAYBE WE COULD
HAVE LUNCH TOMORROW.

18:02.875 --> 18:05.083
I-I MEAN, UNLESS YOU'RE
DOING SOMETHING WITH SCOTT.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.166
NO.

18:06.208 --> 18:07.583
OH, OKAY.

18:07.625 --> 18:09.625
UH, I--IT'S NO PROBLEM.
I GET IT.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.041
NO, NO, NO.

18:11.083 --> 18:14.500
I MEANT, NO, I DON'T HAVE PLANS
WITH SCOTT, BECAUSE...

18:14.542 --> 18:16.542
SCOTT AND I BROKE UP.

18:16.583 --> 18:19.959
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

18:20.000 --> 18:21.458
YEAH, I KNOW.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.834
YOU DO?

18:22.875 --> 18:24.208
THEN WHY...

18:24.250 --> 18:26.291
I WAS JUST--I WAS TRY--
(laughs)

18:26.333 --> 18:27.917
I DON'T KNOW. I WAS...

18:27.959 --> 18:29.250
(laughs) PETE.

18:29.291 --> 18:31.500
(chuckles)

18:31.542 --> 18:33.083
(laughs) WELL, I, UM...

18:33.125 --> 18:34.500
(clears throat) I DO HAVE
A LOT OF PAT--

18:34.542 --> 18:37.625
I HAVE PATIENTS
ALL DAY TOMORROW, SO...

18:37.667 --> 18:39.041
SOME OTHER TIME THEN.

18:39.083 --> 18:41.458
OKAY.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.333
OKAY.

18:48.959 --> 18:50.625
OKAY.

18:57.375 --> 18:59.250
(Amelia) ADDISON,
ARE YOU HOME?

18:59.291 --> 19:01.959
YEAH, UP HERE.

19:06.959 --> 19:08.291
SURPRISE.

19:08.333 --> 19:11.250
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR OFFICE?

19:11.291 --> 19:12.375
I GOT RID OF EVERYTHING

19:12.417 --> 19:15.458
SO YOU COULD FILL IT UP.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.500
I FIGURED WE COULD PUT
THE CRIB RIGHT OVER THERE,

19:17.542 --> 19:20.083
THE CHANGING TABLE
RIGHT UNDER THE WINDOW

19:20.125 --> 19:22.083
SO YOU GET PLENTY OF FRESH AIR,
AND THESE...

19:22.125 --> 19:24.417
THESE ARE
ALL OF MY BABY BOOKS--

19:24.458 --> 19:27.041
EVERYTHING FROM WHAT
TO NAME YOUR BABY TO,

19:27.083 --> 19:29.083
OH, WHAT WEIRD FOOD OBJECT
YOUR BABY

19:29.125 --> 19:31.125
IS THE SAME SIZE AS
EACH WEEK.

19:31.166 --> 19:33.041
SOME OF THEM--
SOME OF THEM ARE HIGHLIGHTED.

19:33.083 --> 19:35.041
ACTUALLY--ACTUALLY,
ALL OF THEM ARE HIGHLIGHTED.

19:35.083 --> 19:37.041
THAT--A LOT OF PEOPLE
DON'T LIKE THAT.

19:37.083 --> 19:38.500
BUT THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
YOUR NURSERY.

19:38.542 --> 19:40.417
DOESN'T MATTER.

19:40.458 --> 19:44.709
I DON'T THINK I AM
EVER GONNA HAVE A BABY.

19:44.750 --> 19:47.375
BUT THE UNIVERSE WORKS
IN AMAZING WAYS,

19:47.417 --> 19:49.083
AND YOU...

19:49.125 --> 19:51.041
ARE.

19:51.083 --> 19:52.750
(sighs)

19:52.792 --> 19:55.375
I'M SORRY. ALL THIS IS...
WONDERFUL, ADDIE.

19:55.417 --> 19:58.250
I JUST--
THIS IS TOO FAST.

19:58.291 --> 20:01.500
AND I'M NOT READY.

20:03.875 --> 20:06.000
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

20:06.041 --> 20:07.875
OKAY.

20:07.917 --> 20:10.000
WHERE'S MY MOM?

20:10.041 --> 20:12.000
RIGHT UPSTAIRS.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.834
THIS ISN'T FAIR, BUDDY.

20:15.875 --> 20:18.041
THIS IS JUST--
IT'S NOWHERE NEAR FAIR.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.625
AND I WISH I COULD KEEP

20:19.667 --> 20:23.667
ALL THE BAD THINGS
IN THE WORLD AWAY FROM YOU.

20:23.709 --> 20:25.166
BUT I CAN'T.

20:25.208 --> 20:28.041
I'M JUST SO SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

20:29.542 --> 20:31.709
DAD, IF THERE'S NO CURE,

20:31.750 --> 20:35.125
HOW'S MY MOM
GONNA GET BETTER?

20:36.709 --> 20:39.041
I-I READ THIS STORY ONCE
ABOUT A GRANDMA

20:39.083 --> 20:40.709
WHO GOT SICK.

20:40.750 --> 20:42.417
AND THE ENTIRE FAMILY PRAYED,

20:42.458 --> 20:45.709
AND SHE GOT BETTER.

20:45.750 --> 20:47.458
SHOULD WE BE DOING THAT?

20:47.500 --> 20:49.500
DOES PRAYING HELP?

20:49.542 --> 20:51.875
SOMETIMES, YEAH.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.917
CAN YOU TEACH ME?

20:55.083 --> 20:57.458
YEAH, UM...

20:57.500 --> 20:58.875
LET'S SEE.

20:58.917 --> 21:01.750
I THINK YOU START BY FOLDING
YOUR HANDS TOGETHER.

21:01.792 --> 21:03.500
YOU, TOO.

21:03.542 --> 21:05.083
OKAY.

21:05.125 --> 21:07.542
UM...

21:07.583 --> 21:10.709
AND THEN YOU JUST... TALK

21:10.750 --> 21:15.667
ABOUT YOUR LIFE
AND ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.000
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO KNEEL?

21:18.792 --> 21:20.542
UH, UH, I DON'T.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.333
THEN I WON'T.

21:22.375 --> 21:24.375
OKAY.

21:49.417 --> 21:51.083
AMEN.

21:51.125 --> 21:53.000
AMEN.

21:53.041 --> 21:54.083
DAD.

21:54.125 --> 21:55.333
MM-HMM.

21:55.375 --> 21:57.375
DID I DO IT RIGHT? DO YOU
THINK GOD HEARD ME?

21:57.417 --> 21:59.291
YEAH, I DO.

21:59.333 --> 22:00.792
(sniffles)

22:00.834 --> 22:02.041
(grunts)

22:07.208 --> 22:08.375
HEY.

22:08.417 --> 22:09.792
HEY. ANOTHER SESSION
WITH THE CRAZY CAT LADY?

22:09.834 --> 22:11.166
UH, NO.
COMBATIVE SCHIZOPHRENIC.

22:11.208 --> 22:12.583
APPARENTLY, I LOOK LIKE
HIS MOTHER,

22:12.625 --> 22:14.000
AND, UH, HE HATES HIS MOTHER.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.041
(chuckles)

22:15.083 --> 22:16.166
TOOK TWO NURSES
AND A SECURITY GUARD

22:16.208 --> 22:17.792
TO HOLD HIM WHILE I PUSHED
THE HALOPERIDOL.

22:17.834 --> 22:19.000
COFFEE OR TEA?

22:19.041 --> 22:21.083
TEA. UM, SO, UH,

22:21.125 --> 22:23.291
PETE AND I RAN INTO
EACH OTHER LAST NIGHT.

22:23.333 --> 22:24.917
MM-HMM.

22:24.959 --> 22:27.041
I THINK HE WANTED
TO KISS ME.

22:27.083 --> 22:28.166
DID YOU LET HIM?

22:28.208 --> 22:29.917
NO.
VIOLET.

22:29.959 --> 22:31.041
OH, I WANTED TO,
BELIEVE ME.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.375
BUT?

22:32.417 --> 22:33.792
WELL, I JUST--
IT SEEMED LAZY AFTER,

22:33.834 --> 22:35.041
YOU KNOW,
EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN THROUGH.

22:35.083 --> 22:36.417
YEAH.
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:36.458 --> 22:38.250
EVERY TIME
SAM AND I'D HAVE A FIGHT,

22:38.291 --> 22:39.875
HE'D SHOW UP LATER

22:39.917 --> 22:41.625
ALL SEXY,
SMELLING LIKE COOKIES.

22:41.667 --> 22:42.959
AND WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

22:43.000 --> 22:45.625
OOF. I FELL FOR IT,
EVERY SINGLE TIME.

22:45.667 --> 22:47.250
WELL, MAYBE
I'M OVERTHINKING THIS.

22:47.291 --> 22:49.250
MM. I DON'T KNOW.
DIDN'T WORK FOR US.

22:49.291 --> 22:52.250
TURNS OUT, SOME PROBLEMS
ARE TOO BIG FOR EVEN...

22:52.291 --> 22:54.291
MIND-BLOWING SEX TO SOLVE.

22:56.917 --> 22:59.917
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

23:01.375 --> 23:02.750
MM.

23:02.792 --> 23:04.667
HEY.

23:04.709 --> 23:06.208
THANK YOU.

23:06.250 --> 23:08.250
YOU TWO DOING OKAY?

23:08.291 --> 23:10.250
I COULDN'T GET HIM
TO GO HOME LAST NIGHT, BUT...

23:10.291 --> 23:13.041
(inhales deeply)
HOW'S ERICA DOING?

23:13.083 --> 23:15.083
IT'S ALMOST OVER.

23:18.959 --> 23:20.500
(groans)

23:20.542 --> 23:22.667
HEY, SWEETIE.

23:22.709 --> 23:24.041
YOU WANT TO HEAD HOME
FOR A WHILE,

23:24.083 --> 23:25.375
MAYBE SLEEP
IN YOUR OWN BED?

23:25.417 --> 23:27.250
I THINK I KINDA WANT
TO STAY HERE.

23:27.291 --> 23:29.041
IS THAT OKAY?
OF COURSE.

23:29.083 --> 23:30.291
OH, UM...

23:30.333 --> 23:32.667
I HAVE SOMETHING
FOR MY MOM.

23:32.709 --> 23:34.041
UH, DO YOU MIND
GIVING IT TO HER?

23:34.083 --> 23:35.291
SURE.

23:35.333 --> 23:37.458
I DIDN'T GET TO FRAME IT,
BUT, UM, I WAS THINKING,

23:37.500 --> 23:41.041
MAYBE IF SHE SAW IT,
SHE WOULDN'T FEEL SO ALONE.

23:41.083 --> 23:43.709
WELL, THAT'S REAL SWEET.

23:43.750 --> 23:47.625
HEY, UH, MAYBE I COULD
HANG OUT WITH YOU FOR A WHILE

23:47.667 --> 23:49.834
SO YOUR DAD CAN GO
TAKE CARE OF SOME THINGS.

23:49.875 --> 23:51.000
OKAY.

23:53.083 --> 23:55.333
(Cooper clears throat)

23:56.750 --> 23:58.458
(lowered voice) YOU NEED
TO GO SEE ERICA.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.041
NOW?

24:00.083 --> 24:01.291
NOW.

24:01.333 --> 24:02.500
(mouths word)

24:07.166 --> 24:10.125
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

24:10.166 --> 24:12.875
(people speak indistinctly)

24:17.083 --> 24:18.500
HEY.

24:20.083 --> 24:22.667
HI.

24:22.709 --> 24:26.709
(beeping continues)

24:26.750 --> 24:29.041
I'M SO SORRY YOU WERE ALONE
ALL THOSE YEARS,

24:29.083 --> 24:31.291
RAISING MASON.

24:31.333 --> 24:35.125
I WISH I'D KNOWN. I WISH
I'D BEEN ABLE TO HELP.

24:35.166 --> 24:37.333
BUT THIS KID
THAT YOU RAISED?

24:37.375 --> 24:39.083
(labored breathing)

24:39.125 --> 24:41.375
MY GOD, ERICA,
HE'S AMAZING.

24:41.417 --> 24:44.125
AND YOU DID THAT.

24:44.166 --> 24:47.000
YOU.

24:52.458 --> 24:56.500
AND I AM SO GRATEFUL
YOU BROUGHT HIM TO ME.

24:56.542 --> 24:59.542
(labored breathing
continues)

25:07.166 --> 25:10.041
(voice breaks)
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

25:10.083 --> 25:13.000
(labored breathing
continues)

25:15.750 --> 25:19.333
I'M SO... GLAD YOU'RE...

25:22.083 --> 25:23.583
HIS DAD.

25:26.500 --> 25:28.041
COME ON, JUDI.
YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.

25:28.083 --> 25:30.041
(grunts)
DID YOU PAGE ME?

25:30.083 --> 25:31.250
YEAH. I THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD SEE THIS.

25:31.291 --> 25:32.458
(grunts and exhales)

25:32.500 --> 25:33.667
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

25:33.709 --> 25:35.417
JUST YOUR
GARDEN-VARIETY MIRACLE.

25:35.458 --> 25:36.625
AH!

25:36.667 --> 25:38.542
IT'S OKAY.
YOU CAN DO THIS...

25:38.583 --> 25:39.750
(mouths word)

25:39.792 --> 25:41.250
JUDI.
(panting)

25:41.291 --> 25:43.250
I'M JUST HERE
FOR MORAL SUPPORT.

25:43.291 --> 25:45.667
I'M HAVING A--OH--
A BOY.

25:45.709 --> 25:47.208
AND HE'S ALMOST HERE.
PUSH.

25:47.250 --> 25:48.542
GOOD.

25:48.583 --> 25:49.875
THERE.

25:49.917 --> 25:51.041
OHH.
THERE HE IS.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.875
(baby crying)
GOOD.

25:52.917 --> 25:54.208
(continues crying)

25:54.250 --> 25:55.583
OHH.

25:55.625 --> 25:58.667
(continues crying)

26:00.583 --> 26:02.041
HE'S PERFECT.

26:02.083 --> 26:05.709
(continues crying)

26:05.750 --> 26:08.208
CAN YOU BELIEVE I GOT TO
DO THAT SEVEN TIMES TODAY?

26:08.250 --> 26:09.917
HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

26:09.959 --> 26:11.208
AND YOUR BABY
WILL BE, TOO.

26:11.250 --> 26:14.125
(continues crying)
SHH.

26:16.917 --> 26:20.041
I JUST WATCHED ADDISON
DELIVER A BABY,

26:20.083 --> 26:22.041
WHICH IS ABOUT THE THOUSANDTH
TIME I'VE SEEN IT,

26:22.083 --> 26:24.250
BUT... (sighs)

26:24.291 --> 26:26.417
BUT WHAT?

26:26.458 --> 26:29.166
BUT NOTHING. IT...

26:29.208 --> 26:30.792
IT WAS SURREAL.

26:30.834 --> 26:32.709
YEAH, I REMEMBER WATCHING
MAYA BEING BORN.

26:32.750 --> 26:35.041
IT WAS--
IT WAS MAGICAL.

26:35.083 --> 26:37.834
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY--
WHY ADDISON WANTS IT SO BADLY.

26:37.875 --> 26:40.750
MM. WELL, NOT ANYMORE.

26:40.792 --> 26:42.959
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

26:43.000 --> 26:46.625
SHE TOLD ME, SHE'S GIVEN UP
ON HAVING A BABY.

26:46.667 --> 26:49.041
ELISE'S LABOR
IS PROGRESSING QUICKLY.

26:49.083 --> 26:50.959
SHE SHOULD GIVE BIRTH
RELATIVELY SOON.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.875
SHE'LL GET TO SPEND
A LITTLE TIME WITH THE BABY,

26:52.917 --> 26:54.667
AND THEN--
THE SECOND MY DAUGHTER
IS BORN,

26:54.709 --> 26:55.875
YOU BRING HER TO ME.

26:55.917 --> 26:57.250
ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT?

26:57.291 --> 26:59.959
LOOK, I'M NOT DEFENDING ELISE.
I'M NOT DEFENDING MYSELF.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.417
THIS NEVER SHOULD'VE HAPPENED.

27:01.458 --> 27:03.959
BUT YOU AND ELISE ARE ABOUT
TO HAVE ANOTHER BABY TOGETHER.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.291
YOU KNOW, EVERYONE IS SO
CONCERNED WITH ELISE'S FEELINGS.

27:07.333 --> 27:08.917
WELL, WHAT ABOUT MINE?

27:08.959 --> 27:10.917
WHAT ABOUT
MY RIGHT AS A FATHER

27:10.959 --> 27:13.083
TO WATCH MY CHILDREN
GROW UP?

27:13.125 --> 27:14.375
CURT...

27:14.417 --> 27:17.166
IF ELISE IS SET FREE
BECAUSE OF THAT SHRINK,

27:17.208 --> 27:18.500
I WILL SUE YOU.

27:18.542 --> 27:20.000
I WILL SUE ALL OF YOU.

27:20.041 --> 27:21.959
I'LL RUIN YOU.

27:26.083 --> 27:28.083
ELISE,
ON THE COUNT OF THREE,

27:28.125 --> 27:30.041
I NEED YOU TO START
REALLY BEARING DOWN, OKAY?

27:30.083 --> 27:31.125
MM-HMM.

27:31.166 --> 27:33.667
OKAY. ONE, TWO, THREE.

27:33.709 --> 27:35.041
PUSH.

27:35.083 --> 27:37.667
OH, IT HURTS.
I CAN'T DO IT.

27:37.709 --> 27:39.500
ELISE,
