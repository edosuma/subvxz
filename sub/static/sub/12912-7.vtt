<i>* In this world *</i>

00:05.300 --> 00:06.500
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

00:06.580 --> 00:10.300

00:34.100 --> 00:37.780

00:37.860 --> 00:38.980

00:44.900 --> 00:48.460
<i>* I just wanna be... *</i>

01:07.300 --> 01:08.500
Hey!

01:09.060 --> 01:10.380
It almost hit me!

01:10.460 --> 01:13.340
The full moon will bring the dragon.
We have to sharpen our reflexes.

01:22.580 --> 01:24.780
Does it have to move so fast?

01:26.620 --> 01:28.220
Nice shot, Rita.

01:31.580 --> 01:33.460
You won't get a chance
to miss with the dragon.

01:36.300 --> 01:37.420
Again.

01:47.700 --> 01:50.420
I like this ball.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.180
I'm so sorry, Rita.
I didn't mean to.

02:22.260 --> 02:25.540
That's quite okay, Weilan.
- That thing you did was incredible.

02:26.380 --> 02:27.380
What was it?

02:27.460 --> 02:30.740
It's a form of Eastern mermaid
self-defense. Am I right?

02:30.820 --> 02:31.900
Turn the tide.

02:31.980 --> 02:34.300
Its purpose is
to turn magic back on itself.

02:34.380 --> 02:36.500
It must have taken
you ages to master it.

02:36.580 --> 02:38.660
It's very difficult to learn.

02:38.740 --> 02:40.660
Eastern mermaids are taught it
from when they're hatchlings.

02:40.740 --> 02:43.460
So it's not that special.

02:43.540 --> 02:46.260
Except that no Southern mermaid
has ever mastered it.

02:53.420 --> 02:56.700
"Locate and catalog
a marine ecosystem."

02:58.820 --> 03:00.140
How hard can that be?

03:00.220 --> 03:03.500
Doing a biology assignment on the
weekend? It's not hard, it's torture.

03:04.940 --> 03:08.260
I've already scoped out Mako.
The rock pools are ideal.

03:08.340 --> 03:10.940
Hundreds of species living
in symbiotic harmony.

03:11.020 --> 03:12.460
Sounds perfect.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.700
Except, I can't go.

03:14.780 --> 03:17.580
I have to work. So you guys have
to do the assignment without me.

03:17.660 --> 03:19.660
This was meant to
be a group project.

03:19.740 --> 03:23.580
If it's that important, Ondina and
I could cover your shift for you.

03:23.660 --> 03:25.660
What?
-I don't know, Mimmi.

03:25.740 --> 03:27.420
It's a lot of responsibility.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.900
Yeah, Mimmi.

03:28.980 --> 03:31.740
I've been a customer here long
enough to know what to do,

03:31.820 --> 03:34.580
and Ondina already has some experience.
- Thanks.

03:34.660 --> 03:37.260
I really appreciate it.
-No problem.

03:40.940 --> 03:43.580
My time as a waitress
wasn't pretty, remember?

03:43.660 --> 03:47.500
And besides, I planned on mastering
Weilan's little party trick today.

03:47.580 --> 03:50.340
You're going to learn turn
the tide? Just like that?

03:50.420 --> 03:52.580
If Weilan can do it,
how hard can it be?

03:52.660 --> 03:53.820
Turn the what?

03:53.900 --> 03:55.700
Weilan knows this
awesome technique.

03:55.780 --> 03:58.900
She can turn magic force around and
throw it back where it came from.

04:00.420 --> 04:03.140
So she can turn magic back on itself?
-Mmm.

04:09.620 --> 04:11.940
Turn the tide. Show it to me.

04:12.020 --> 04:14.140
I want a demonstration.
-Why?

04:14.220 --> 04:15.700
Humor me.

04:16.820 --> 04:17.940
Okay.

04:21.660 --> 04:23.060
Zap me.

04:23.140 --> 04:24.340
Well, I don't want to hurt you.

04:24.420 --> 04:25.980
You won't.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.220
Okay.

04:35.620 --> 04:38.300
Ow.
-I never said you wouldn't hurt yourself.

04:43.780 --> 04:46.060
You got back exactly
what you sent at me.

04:46.140 --> 04:49.060
If you'd sent me a gentle breeze,
you would have gotten that back.

04:50.300 --> 04:53.500
What about cold dragon fire?

04:54.900 --> 04:56.620
Forget it. It can't be done.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.700
Well, why not?
It's a defensive move, right?

04:59.780 --> 05:01.780
We can turn it into
an attacking move.

05:03.060 --> 05:04.900
Teach me.

05:04.980 --> 05:09.460
If I can turn the dragon fire back
on itself, maybe I can destroy it.

05:09.540 --> 05:13.820
The entire Eastern pod,
including tenth level mermaids,

05:13.900 --> 05:15.900
lost their powers
to this creature.

05:16.820 --> 05:18.580
What makes you any different?

05:21.540 --> 05:22.660
I'm a merman.

05:24.060 --> 05:26.060
I've saved the pod before.
I can do it again.

05:26.140 --> 05:28.900
It takes years to
master this technique.

05:29.980 --> 05:32.180
You think you can do it
in a couple of days?

05:33.860 --> 05:36.020
We'll never know
if you don't give me a chance.

05:49.700 --> 05:51.340
There should be some seafood
arriving soon.

05:51.420 --> 05:53.140
And make sure the drink fridge
is stocked from the back.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.500
The back. Got it.

05:54.580 --> 05:56.860
Don't worry, David.
Everything is under control.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.460
You don't have to
worry about a thing.

05:58.540 --> 06:00.220
Thanks again.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.100
This is going to be awesome.

06:02.180 --> 06:05.100
I was up till midnight researching
a rare species of algae

06:05.180 --> 06:06.580
that's unique to the area.

06:06.660 --> 06:09.140
And I thought this was
going to be a boring trip.

06:09.220 --> 06:12.020
Where's Evie?
-Oh, she said she'd meet us there.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.740
Why use a boat when you can
use a tail, right?

06:16.180 --> 06:17.700
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>you're not coming?</i>

06:17.780 --> 06:20.100
We're meant to do
this assignment together.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.580
I have another idea for it.
<i>-What idea?</i>

06:22.660 --> 06:24.100
And since when?

06:24.180 --> 06:25.860
<i>Well, I don't want to say
in case it doesn't pan out.</i>

06:25.940 --> 06:28.420
You get going and we'll
talk when you get back.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.620
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

06:43.900 --> 06:45.820
You don't mind lying to Evie?

06:45.900 --> 06:47.660
Of course I mind.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.100
But she can't know about this or
she'll try and talk me out of it.

06:50.180 --> 06:53.180
Mmm. So would the others.
-Mmm.

06:53.260 --> 06:55.340
What we're doing
is very dangerous.

06:55.420 --> 06:57.900
So it has to be our secret,
all right?

07:04.220 --> 07:06.700
Well, are you going to order?

07:09.940 --> 07:11.540
You've been sitting
here for five minutes.

07:11.620 --> 07:14.820
If you don't know what you want to
eat, you're obviously not hungry.

07:14.900 --> 07:18.340
Trouble with the customer?
-I know. Rude, huh?

07:20.940 --> 07:23.420
Is something on your mind?
-No.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.140
Come on.

07:25.220 --> 07:28.220
Ondina,
you've been grouchy all morning.

07:29.660 --> 07:30.780
It doesn't make sense

07:30.860 --> 07:32.980
that Eastern mermaids
can do things we can't.

07:33.060 --> 07:35.260
It's not like we're
made differently.

07:35.340 --> 07:37.180
You're still thinking
about turn the tide?

07:38.260 --> 07:41.340
Northern mermaids can do things
that Southern mermaids can't.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.660
It's never bothered you before.

07:43.740 --> 07:46.260
Who's bothered? I'm just saying.

07:58.980 --> 08:01.060
Okay. Conjure me a water ball.

08:02.620 --> 08:04.620
What? In here?

08:04.700 --> 08:07.420
Yes. I'm going to master this.

08:09.340 --> 08:10.580
Fine.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.820
That was way too fast!

08:20.900 --> 08:23.180
Not for an Eastern mermaid.

08:25.820 --> 08:27.420
When you're done...

08:28.220 --> 08:30.900
maybe you could try your
hand at clearing plates.

08:41.380 --> 08:45.220
There's a clearing inland. It's
totally hidden. It'll be perfect.

08:45.300 --> 08:48.780
Slow down, Zac. You need
to know the ground rules.

08:48.860 --> 08:51.580
You must do everything I say.

08:51.660 --> 08:53.780
No arguing. I'm in charge.

08:53.860 --> 08:56.660
Understand?
-Okay.

08:58.340 --> 09:01.620
This is going to be the
hardest thing you've ever done.

09:01.700 --> 09:04.740
Trust me. You're going to wish
you'd never asked for it.

09:04.820 --> 09:06.860
I think I can handle it.

09:09.900 --> 09:10.980
We'll see.

09:29.060 --> 09:30.660
Okay.

09:30.740 --> 09:32.300
What's first?

09:32.380 --> 09:33.740
Do this.

09:38.140 --> 09:41.260
Back straight, feet apart,
right leg forward.

09:41.340 --> 09:42.460
Good.

09:43.380 --> 09:44.460
Hmm.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.340
Won't I be in the
water on the night?

09:47.420 --> 09:50.460
Once you've mastered the technique,
you'll be able to do it anywhere,

09:50.540 --> 09:52.220
in the water or on land.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.940
Arms slightly forward,
bent at the elbow.

09:56.860 --> 09:58.060
Like this.

09:58.540 --> 10:00.140
Here, let me show you.

10:11.900 --> 10:13.660
Whoa. What was that?

10:13.740 --> 10:15.420
This isn't a race.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.100
The dragon won't take it slow.

10:17.180 --> 10:18.860
You need to focus
on getting the move right first.

10:18.940 --> 10:19.940
I got the move.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.980
No, I say when you've got it
and you're not even close.

10:22.060 --> 10:23.260
Now watch and copy me again.

10:24.180 --> 10:25.220
Ready?

10:26.140 --> 10:27.180
Yes.

10:36.260 --> 10:37.660
Okay, show me.

10:44.660 --> 10:47.260
Good. Now give me 60 like that.

10:48.220 --> 10:52.020
Sixty?
-No arguing, remember?

10:57.460 --> 10:59.500
One.

10:59.580 --> 11:00.820
One.

11:03.780 --> 11:04.900
Two.

11:09.140 --> 11:10.140
Three.

11:24.860 --> 11:26.900
Ugh! Stupid move!

11:30.140 --> 11:31.940
David! Fish is here!

11:33.700 --> 11:36.780
Oi! It's staff only back there.

11:37.660 --> 11:39.220
Hello, Joe.

11:39.300 --> 11:40.980
David's gone for the day.

11:41.060 --> 11:44.940
He has an important assignment with
school so... I'm taking his place.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.540
You?
-Mmm.

11:47.620 --> 11:49.740
Where's Cam?

11:49.820 --> 11:51.860
He's gone, too.

11:51.940 --> 11:53.380
Can I do something for you?

11:53.460 --> 11:55.980
Yeah, you can. You can grab
your stuff and you can go.

11:56.060 --> 11:57.860
I'm taking over.
-What?

11:57.940 --> 11:59.180
You're not trained
in proper food handling.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.540
David should know better.
-But...

12:01.700 --> 12:03.100
<i>Adiós.</i>
- Wait!

12:03.180 --> 12:04.900
No, don't go in there!

12:09.540 --> 12:11.700
And what are you doing in here?

12:11.780 --> 12:13.260
Uh...

12:13.340 --> 12:16.220
Ondina's helping David, too.
She's, uh...

12:17.500 --> 12:19.460
cleaning the cool room.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.340
Well,
I'll be having words with David.

12:23.340 --> 12:25.060
Go on. Out!

12:27.140 --> 12:30.180
Come on, vamoose! Let's go!

12:42.020 --> 12:43.020
What kept you?

12:44.700 --> 12:47.340
Yes, well, as a fish,
you do have an unfair advantage.

12:47.420 --> 12:49.700
Find any good rock pools?
-Take your pick.

12:49.780 --> 12:51.060
The place is teeming with life.

12:51.140 --> 12:53.860
This is going to be so great.
-Where's Zac?

12:53.940 --> 12:57.180
Oh, he just decided
at the last minute

12:57.260 --> 12:59.780
that he had a better idea
for the assignment.

12:59.860 --> 13:01.900
What?
- He didn't say.

13:01.980 --> 13:03.020
That's weird.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.780
That's my boyfriend.

13:07.980 --> 13:09.100
Come on.

13:18.580 --> 13:21.100
Okay, that was 60.

13:21.740 --> 13:24.100
I've got it. I'm ready to go.

13:24.180 --> 13:26.540
Another 60.
-No, no, no. I'm good to go.

13:28.300 --> 13:32.620
What part of me being in charge
do you not understand?

13:32.700 --> 13:36.060
Please.
I'm going to surprise you.

13:38.180 --> 13:39.300
Okay.

13:50.820 --> 13:52.780
What was I meant
to be surprised by?

13:55.260 --> 13:56.900
Another 60...

14:03.740 --> 14:04.820
One.

14:13.380 --> 14:15.820
We have to get rid of the
water ball before he sees it.

14:16.780 --> 14:17.900
Now.

14:27.020 --> 14:28.060
Oi!

14:33.460 --> 14:34.540
Out.

14:38.380 --> 14:39.980
Unbelievable.

15:05.500 --> 15:06.500
Joe?

15:08.500 --> 15:11.700
There is a flying ball
of water in there.

15:11.780 --> 15:15.420
Are you okay? You look... pale.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.140
No...

15:17.220 --> 15:19.100
It's in there.
It looked right at me.

15:19.180 --> 15:23.100
I think you need to sit down
and have a drink of water.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.220
Yeah.

15:44.660 --> 15:46.940
Here, bally-ball.

15:52.300 --> 15:53.460
Here, ball.

16:09.860 --> 16:11.820
No.

16:11.900 --> 16:13.420
Forty-eight.

16:15.740 --> 16:18.260
Forty-nine.

16:19.140 --> 16:21.380
Can we take a break?
I'm busting a sweat here.

16:22.260 --> 16:23.620
Forty-nine.

16:34.860 --> 16:36.660
You were probably dehydrated.

16:36.740 --> 16:39.340
I mean,
that can affect your vision.

16:39.420 --> 16:40.820
You think I'm seeing things?

16:42.060 --> 16:43.420
Come on. I'll show you.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.740
Come on. No, come on.
-I really don't think that's a good idea.

16:51.020 --> 16:52.820
Maybe you need to eat something.

16:52.900 --> 16:54.940
I can make you a sandwich.
It's really no problem.

16:55.020 --> 16:57.020
Oh...

16:58.860 --> 17:00.700
I think I need a rest.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.780
I don't understand.
It was right here.

17:34.980 --> 17:37.860
It's a hot day.

17:37.940 --> 17:40.260
The temperature probably
made you see something.

17:41.340 --> 17:42.500
Maybe.

17:47.660 --> 17:49.300
How did you...

17:49.380 --> 17:51.980
I was... I was just...
-Shall we go?

17:52.060 --> 17:53.580
Good idea.

17:53.660 --> 17:55.740
Bye, Joe.
-Bye.

17:59.300 --> 18:02.100
I didn't know soldier crabs
lived this far north.

18:02.180 --> 18:04.940
And there's heaps of them in here.
- That's really interesting.

18:05.020 --> 18:06.260
Carly, can we file that under

18:06.340 --> 18:08.300
"I think we've got enough.
Can we go home now?"

18:08.380 --> 18:09.860
I need some more photos first.

18:12.780 --> 18:14.220
Is there any more water?

18:14.300 --> 18:17.740
I'll get some.
There's a spring nearby.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.660
Watch out for leeches.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.420
Get up.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.380
You think the dragon's
going to wait for you?

18:35.460 --> 18:37.220
Get up.

18:38.380 --> 18:42.700
You were right.
I can't do this. Not in a day.

18:42.780 --> 18:44.420
You're thinking
about it too much.

18:44.500 --> 18:47.660
Of course I'm thinking about it.
What do you expect me to do?

18:47.740 --> 18:49.340
Defend yourself.

18:50.980 --> 18:52.020
How?

18:53.300 --> 18:54.820
What are you doing?

19:01.780 --> 19:03.540
That is not funny.

19:31.140 --> 19:33.420
You did it! You turned the tide!

19:33.500 --> 19:35.020
I did it!

19:36.100 --> 19:38.220
Thank you so much.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.780
I couldn't have
done it without you.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.380
So this was your new idea?

19:52.620 --> 19:55.140
Evie, stop, stop! This is
not what you think it is.

19:56.100 --> 19:58.180
The others are waiting for me.

19:58.260 --> 20:00.780
You should get back to whatever
it is you two were doing.

20:03.420 --> 20:04.980
Evie!

20:11.060 --> 20:12.340
Evie?

20:13.660 --> 20:14.660
Evie!

20:17.180 --> 20:18.180
Evie!

20:19.700 --> 20:20.700
Evie!

20:20.780 --> 20:22.100
Zac?

20:32.660 --> 20:36.060
Evie... what you saw on Mako,
it was nothing.

20:36.140 --> 20:37.940
It didn't look like nothing.

20:38.020 --> 20:40.180
Weilan was showing me some
Eastern magic. That's it.

20:40.260 --> 20:42.540
You ditched me to
hang out with her.

20:44.020 --> 20:46.100
When she told me
about these cool Eastern spells,

20:46.180 --> 20:48.300
I couldn't wait to try them out.

20:48.380 --> 20:49.900
And you know what it's like.

20:49.980 --> 20:52.300
Magic versus schoolwork, it's
not a hard choice to make, right?

20:55.980 --> 20:57.500
You could have let me know.

20:59.060 --> 21:01.260
You would have told me to get
back to work on my assignment.

21:04.660 --> 21:07.340
You're right. I would have.

21:09.220 --> 21:11.900
You're lucky David
took a lot of notes.

21:17.100 --> 21:18.660
I promise you...

21:19.740 --> 21:22.140
there is nothing going on
between me and Weilan.

21:30.980 --> 21:35.140
I can't believe you did that today.
-Okay. Maybe I got a bit carried away.

21:35.220 --> 21:38.820
A bit? You're obsessed!
-I am not obsessed.

21:38.900 --> 21:42.180
Weilan only gets under your
scales because she is like you.

21:42.260 --> 21:43.580
She is not like me.

21:43.660 --> 21:47.060
Headstrong, gifted,
always thinks she's right.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.420
Sound familiar?

21:48.500 --> 21:49.940
She is not that gifted.

21:50.020 --> 21:52.900
You could just ask her
to teach you turn the tide,

21:52.980 --> 21:55.780
and in return,
you could teach her something.

21:57.380 --> 21:59.020
Hmm. Like?

22:00.580 --> 22:01.660
Um...

22:03.820 --> 22:05.380
Like?
-Oh, hang on.

22:05.460 --> 22:07.060
I mean, I'll think of something.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.820
Everything is good
with Evie now.

22:12.900 --> 22:14.940
Are you sure
she won't get in our way?

22:15.020 --> 22:18.340
Yeah. I just feel awful
about lying to her.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.060
It's for her own safety.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.300
Yeah, I guess.

22:22.380 --> 22:24.740
At least now I've a real shot
at destroying this dragon.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.660
Make no mistake, Zac.

22:28.740 --> 22:31.660
This will be the most dangerous
thing you've ever done.

22:32.420 --> 22:34.940
Yeah, I get that.
-Do you?

22:35.020 --> 22:36.780
When a mermaid is
caught by the dragon,

22:36.860 --> 22:39.660
they lose their tail
and their powers for life.

22:41.580 --> 22:44.260
Nobody knows what will
happen to a merman.

22:51.460 --> 22:53.180
<i>* In this world *</i>

22:53.260 --> 22:54.580
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

22:54.660 --> 22:57.980

22:58.060 --> 22:59.940

23:46.700 --> 23:48.220
