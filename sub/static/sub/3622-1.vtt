( <i>bell ringing</i>) <i>Overall,</i>

00:06.507 --> 00:08.240
I found the results
of yesterday's pop quiz to be...

than usual.

Nice work, K.P.

00:13.914 --> 00:15.214
Uh, yeah.
I crammed

00:15.216 --> 00:17.916
on that riverboat ride
down the Congo.

Cramming? I don't
remember any cramming.

00:42.043 --> 00:43.642
the nightmare I had.

Kim, we got trouble.

There's been a breach

with heated seats
and lumbar support?

02:36.857 --> 02:38.690
Because it also had a sun roof,

02:38.692 --> 02:41.894
which, on a subterranean
vehicle, seemed a little...

I'll become
even more brilliant...

02:53.774 --> 02:55.140
perhaps ridiculously brilliant!

Certainly brilliant enough

We need a way
to get into that lab.

The only way is through
that tiny ventilation duct.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.327
first thing this morning,

I took the liberty
of grading it early.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.065
Well, is there a grade
higher than A+,

07:47.067 --> 07:48.733
or are you just going
to make one up for me?

07:48.735 --> 07:50.569
We'll go with
the traditional "F."

07:50.571 --> 07:51.670
Hmm?
What?

07:51.672 --> 07:53.004
But I did it longhand,

07:53.006 --> 07:54.639
and I showed my
work and everything.

07:54.641 --> 07:55.640
Uh-huh.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.309
Your assignment demonstrates

a comprehension
of not only algebra,

07:59.213 --> 08:00.445
but also advanced calculus

and chaos theory mathematics.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.215
It does?

08:03.217 --> 08:04.449
Yes, which means,

08:04.451 --> 08:06.017
it was clearly completed
by someone else.

I swear, Miss Wisp.

09:15.521 --> 09:16.621
( <i>Ron clears throat</i> )

09:16.623 --> 09:17.756
And, um, as you can see,

09:17.758 --> 09:19.591
the rest
is mathematical history.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.059
Can I go now?

Mr. Stoppable, please to explain
your procedure

for finding exponents
in polynomials.

but let me just show you.

to let us go soon.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.573
Wade, I just don't get it.

09:34.575 --> 09:37.409
It's like Ron's been abducted

09:37.411 --> 09:40.445
and replaced by someone...
smart.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.180
Granted, Ron's sudden genius
is a little odd,

09:42.182 --> 09:44.316
but some students blossom late
in their academic careers.

09:44.318 --> 09:46.785
Come on, Wade. This is Ron.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.653
Last night he had

09:48.655 --> 09:50.689
to take off his shoes
to count to 12,

09:50.691 --> 09:54.192
and today he's taking
some genius aptitude test?

09:54.194 --> 09:55.427
Really? How'd he do?

09:55.429 --> 09:56.361
186.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.263
( <i>coughs</i> )

09:58.265 --> 10:01.299
186?! That's 40 points higher
than my score!

10:01.301 --> 10:02.701
That's impossible!

10:02.703 --> 10:04.169
Welcome to my disbelief.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.804
Have Mr. Genius meet me online.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.606
I'll get to the bottom of this.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.874
Something tells me getting close
to Mr. Genius

10:09.876 --> 10:11.176
is not going to be easy.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.244
Sorry, but Ron's time is up.

10:13.246 --> 10:14.245
He's on a very tight schedule.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.246
I am?

10:15.248 --> 10:16.147
Of course.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.616
Ron, your genius is a gift.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.684
A gift you must share
with the world.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.419
( <i>cameras clicking</i> )

10:23.623 --> 10:25.357
Good evening, Middleton.

10:25.359 --> 10:27.425
We begin tonight with the story

10:27.427 --> 10:29.861
of a boy genius
named Ron Stoppable.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.796
After coming out of nowhere,

10:31.798 --> 10:35.133
he's taken the country
and the world by storm.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.534
<i>He's designed the plans</i>

10:36.536 --> 10:38.670
<i>for a new international</i>
<i>space station,</i>

10:38.672 --> 10:41.606
<i>created the world's first</i>
<i>cold fusion reactor</i>

10:41.608 --> 10:43.875
<i>and has even completed</i>

10:43.877 --> 10:47.445
<i>Schubert's</i>
<i>"Unfinished Symphony."</i>

10:47.447 --> 10:50.148
And what does this whiz kid
have to say

10:50.150 --> 10:51.349
about his newfound success?

10:51.351 --> 10:53.385
Um, I just want to pass algebra.

10:53.387 --> 10:54.686
( <i>all laugh</i> )

10:54.688 --> 10:55.820
That's funny.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.789
Trisha Lapowski reporting.

10:57.791 --> 11:02.627
And now, Shego, I shall use
my newly acquired brilliance

11:02.629 --> 11:06.231
to begin the design
of my doomsday device.

11:06.233 --> 11:09.567
( <i>muttering</i> )

11:09.569 --> 11:12.504
Yes, I can feel my brilliance
blossoming.

11:12.506 --> 11:16.307
It's as if my hand
is but a humble servant

11:16.309 --> 11:18.243
to the power
of my advanced mind. Oh!

11:18.245 --> 11:20.345
So, what do you think?

11:20.347 --> 11:21.946
Um, nothing personal,

11:21.948 --> 11:26.384
but it doesn't exactly scream
doomsday or brilliance.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.419
Hmm.

11:27.421 --> 11:28.787
Nonsense.

11:28.789 --> 11:32.824
It must be so advanced
that your own puny intellect

11:32.826 --> 11:34.826
cannot grasp it.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.661
Here.

11:36.663 --> 11:37.662
Take a look at this one.

11:37.664 --> 11:40.799
A puppy and a
horsey. Cute.

11:40.801 --> 11:41.866
Mm. Mm.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.568
( <i>muttering</i> )

11:47.907 --> 11:49.941
Well, look who's back
from his whirlwind press tour.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.943
Yep, tap into
a little inner genius,

11:51.945 --> 11:54.279
and suddenly everybody
wants a piece.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.781
But enough about me.
What have you been up to?

11:56.783 --> 11:58.650
Saw the sequel
to <i>Potential Boy.</i>

11:58.652 --> 12:00.318
It was called <i>Genius Boy.</i>

12:00.320 --> 12:02.887
Good acting, but the plot
seemed a bit farfetched.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.255
Uh-oh.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.490
What is up
with the whiz kid deal?

12:05.492 --> 12:07.325
Well, you know how it is.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.960
I'm a late bloomer, you know?

12:08.962 --> 12:11.262
First with the ladies
and now this.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.364
Did I miss the ladies' bloom?

12:13.366 --> 12:15.266
Hey, Ron, what do you say
we compete

12:15.268 --> 12:17.569
in a little Internet battle
of the geniuses?

12:17.571 --> 12:19.304
Oh, you know,
as much as I'd love to,

12:19.306 --> 12:20.405
I should really be...

12:20.407 --> 12:22.006
There can be only one.

12:22.008 --> 12:23.775
Okay, I guess.
How do we...?

12:23.777 --> 12:25.243
Begin.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.945
Calculate the area

12:26.947 --> 12:28.646
of this four-dimensional,
theoretical object.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.982
Break this DNA sequence
down into its base strings.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.751
Explain Pythagorean's theorem

12:32.753 --> 12:34.352
in relation to exponents,

12:34.354 --> 12:36.588
roots and scientific notation
formulas.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.324
Write a 400-word essay
examining the popularity

12:39.326 --> 12:41.926
of sailor uniforms in
Japanimation and cite examples.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.695
Correct.

12:43.697 --> 12:44.462
Correct.

12:44.464 --> 12:45.463
Correct!

12:46.432 --> 12:47.699
( <i>sighs</i> )

12:47.701 --> 12:49.768
One again, correct.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.402
Well, Kim, he's a genius.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.438
More of a genius
than I'll ever be.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.606
There you are, Ronald.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.274
You're supposed to be
in the auditorium

12:56.276 --> 12:57.876
rehearsing for your press
conference tomorrow.

12:57.878 --> 12:58.943
( <i>sighs</i> )

12:58.945 --> 13:00.678
What's it for again?

13:00.680 --> 13:01.946
You're announcing your cure
for the common cold.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.114
I found it

13:03.116 --> 13:04.783
on your desk the other day

13:04.785 --> 13:06.718
next to your little mole rat.

13:06.720 --> 13:07.719
Great.

13:07.721 --> 13:09.387
Could this get any more wrong?

13:09.389 --> 13:11.456
When did the whole boy genius
miracle start to happen?

13:11.458 --> 13:14.359
Come to think of it,
it was right after

13:14.361 --> 13:16.528
we got back from that lab
in Iowa.

13:20.666 --> 13:21.966
Thanks for the ride, Bernice.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.401
It's the least I could do

13:23.403 --> 13:25.303
after you saved
my artists colony

13:25.305 --> 13:26.704
from that dam break last year.

13:26.706 --> 13:27.939
No big.

13:27.941 --> 13:30.475
It was just like patching up
the cracks

13:30.477 --> 13:33.745
in my fish tank back home,
only it took a lot more gum.

13:52.631 --> 13:55.033
What are you, land developer,

13:55.035 --> 13:57.402
tax collector, sales lady?

13:57.404 --> 13:58.736
Doctor Zaruda, I need
to talk to you

13:58.738 --> 14:00.738
about a device you developed
for the government.

14:00.740 --> 14:04.108
You may be the only person
who actually knows what it does.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.377
Project Phoebus?

14:06.379 --> 14:08.880
Oh, well...

14:08.882 --> 14:10.515
come in.

14:13.986 --> 14:15.753
<i>Okay, Shego...</i>

14:15.755 --> 14:19.858
feast your eyes on this vision
of doomsday genius.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.594
Ooh, try again, Picasso.

14:22.596 --> 14:23.695
Oh, it doesn't make sense!

14:23.697 --> 14:26.364
I was in the chair,
the beam surged,

14:26.366 --> 14:27.432
we all saw it.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.067
Why am I not...

14:29.069 --> 14:30.134
more brilliant?

14:30.136 --> 14:32.036
Brillianter?!
More brillianter?!

14:32.038 --> 14:33.137
Dr. D, check this out.

14:33.139 --> 14:35.974
I'm in front
of the Middleton Mall

14:35.976 --> 14:38.910
where tomorrow morning
resident genius Ron Stoppable

14:38.912 --> 14:39.878
will unveil his cure

14:39.880 --> 14:41.479
for the common cold.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.481
Could this boy be
any more brilliant?

14:43.483 --> 14:45.617
Ron Stoppable?
Help me out.

14:45.619 --> 14:47.986
Kim Possible's dopey sidekick.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.054
Since when is he a genius?!

14:50.056 --> 14:51.122
I'm the one that...

14:51.124 --> 14:52.523
Wait a second.

14:52.525 --> 14:55.960
That boy has my brains
and I want them back.

14:55.962 --> 14:58.830
So let me get this straight.

14:58.832 --> 15:01.132
Project Phoebus contains
the brain-wave patterns

15:01.134 --> 15:03.468
of the world's most
brilliant scientists?

15:03.470 --> 15:04.502
We all used
to be poker buddies...

15:04.504 --> 15:05.703
Gates, Nash, Salk.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.138
They were all over one night.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.173
I wanted to try out
my new project.

15:09.175 --> 15:11.476
Bing, bang, boom,
the rest is history.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.611
So if someone like,
say, my friend Ron

15:13.613 --> 15:16.147
were to accidentally
get struck by the beam,

15:16.149 --> 15:17.548
it could turn him into...

15:17.550 --> 15:21.119
Unparalleled genius,
but not permanently.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.153
The effects
of the Project Phoebus beam

15:22.155 --> 15:23.788
are only temporary.

15:23.790 --> 15:26.658
I'd give it another two to four
days before it wears off.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.793
Sure I can't tempt you
with some squirrel stew?

15:28.795 --> 15:30.728
Oh, gosh, I,
I had it for lunch.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.697
Well, at least that Drakken
fellow didn't get his mitts

15:32.699 --> 15:33.898
on those brain waves.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.700
That much brain power
in the wrong hands

15:35.702 --> 15:36.901
could spell disaster.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.102
Wait a sec.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.171
If Drakken needs
those brain waves,

15:40.173 --> 15:41.839
then he's going to need Ron.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.741
So, this little doohickey here

15:43.743 --> 15:45.810
should reduce
car emissions by...

15:45.812 --> 15:46.911
Well, a lot.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.813
But Mr. Stoppable,

15:48.815 --> 15:50.481
that is your fuel cell equation.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.183
You're pointing
to a time-space theorem.

15:54.520 --> 15:55.586
Right, time-space.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.021
Mm-hmm, you can tell that

15:57.023 --> 15:59.724
by the sideways eight thingy
right over there.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.059
Uh, that's a symbol
for infinity.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.060
Don't you know that?

16:02.062 --> 16:04.629
Are there any other questions?

16:05.898 --> 16:07.098
I have a questions.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.733
Care for a lift?

16:11.236 --> 16:12.870
( <i>all yelling</i>)

16:12.872 --> 16:14.973
Help!

16:14.975 --> 16:17.075
( <i>gasps</i> )

16:17.077 --> 16:19.644
Rufus!

16:21.046 --> 16:23.247
Oh, no.

16:26.952 --> 16:28.152
KIM:
<i>Still nothing?</i>

16:28.154 --> 16:30.188
Wait. We have to find
Drakken's new lair

16:30.190 --> 16:31.990
before he forces Ron
to build him

16:31.992 --> 16:33.791
that new doomsday device.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.626
I know. But there are
more leads I'm checking out.

16:35.628 --> 16:36.861
Stand by.

16:36.863 --> 16:37.996
( <i>crying</i> )

16:37.998 --> 16:39.697
Don't worry, Rufus.
We'll find Ron.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.532
In the meantime,
keep yourself busy.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.834
It'll help take your mind
off things.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.202
Kim, I got a news flash.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.536
Ron's no genius.

16:45.538 --> 16:46.738
What do you mean?

16:46.740 --> 16:49.640
I reexamined
the main security cam for clues.

16:49.642 --> 16:50.608
Check this out.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.910
Wade, what's the big?

16:52.912 --> 16:54.779
That's just Ron writing
an equation.

16:54.781 --> 16:58.616
Sure, that's what it looks like,
but watch when I zoom in.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.022
It's Rufus?

17:04.024 --> 17:04.989
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

17:04.991 --> 17:06.791
So if Rufus is the genius,

17:06.793 --> 17:09.594
then how is Ron going to build
Drakken a doomsday device?

17:09.596 --> 17:10.595
He's not.

17:10.597 --> 17:13.231
<i>So, Kim Possible's sidekick</i>

17:13.233 --> 17:16.034
thinks he can stick his nose
into my business

17:16.036 --> 17:18.136
and steal
my precious brain waves.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.705
Okay, believe it or not,
that's not how it went down.

17:20.707 --> 17:21.672
Shush, boy!

17:21.674 --> 17:23.841
Now is not the time for words.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.143
Now is the time for action.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.677
Well, actually, thought.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.312
Yes, now is the time
for thought,

17:28.314 --> 17:30.248
followed soon after by action.

17:31.183 --> 17:34.052
Ooh, having a garage sale?

17:34.054 --> 17:36.020
You, boy, will use
these supplies

17:36.022 --> 17:37.622
and your stolen genius

17:37.624 --> 17:39.957
to build me a horrific
doomsday device

17:39.959 --> 17:41.926
that will allow me
to conquer the world.

17:41.928 --> 17:42.927
Yeah, you know, sorry

17:42.929 --> 17:44.629
to throw a wrench
into the works,

17:44.631 --> 17:46.197
but it's just not going
to happen 'cause...

17:46.199 --> 17:50.601
Oh, it's going to happen,
because if it doesn't...

17:54.706 --> 17:57.175
( <i>yells</i> )

17:57.177 --> 17:59.710
Okay, so who's up
for a little doomsday device?

17:59.712 --> 18:01.946
KIM:
<i>Don't worry, Wade,</i>

18:01.948 --> 18:04.849
Drakken may have Ron,
but we have the real genius.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.350
( <i>clears throat</i> )

18:06.352 --> 18:07.952
I mean, the other real genius.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.353
( <i>chittering</i> )

18:09.355 --> 18:10.922
Wade, we got a listing:

18:10.924 --> 18:13.758
a recently purchased,
ten-bedroom, 6h-acid-bath lair.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.793
Here's the address.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.864
Is it ready yet, boy?

18:19.866 --> 18:23.701
Uh, it may be another
two or three or 16 weeks.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.037
Now might be a great time
to take that superfreak

18:26.039 --> 18:28.806
singles cruise
you've been thinking about.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.942
That doomsday device
better work.

18:30.944 --> 18:34.145
Otherwise, you'll be swimming
with the fish.

18:34.147 --> 18:36.214
Fish, right?
Or is it fishes?

18:36.216 --> 18:37.248
Fish or fishes.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.916
Well, which is it?

18:38.918 --> 18:42.120
Both are correct plural forms
of the singular word fish.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.888
You're very smug right now,
aren't you?

18:43.890 --> 18:45.056
A little bit.

18:45.058 --> 18:48.759
Okay, then, here it is,
my doomsday device

18:48.761 --> 18:51.162
right here under
the sheet here.

18:51.164 --> 18:54.832
Or as they say in France,
<i>mon device de doom.</i>

18:54.834 --> 18:55.867
French.

18:55.869 --> 18:57.702
Show it to me!

18:57.704 --> 19:02.306
Drakken, Shego,
I give you The Mangler.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.643
( <i>gasps</i> )

19:05.645 --> 19:09.814
Well, Mr. Stoppable,
have fun with the fish...

19:09.816 --> 19:11.649
or fishes.

19:21.093 --> 19:24.395
Can't there ever by
a one-story ranch-style lair?

19:24.397 --> 19:26.697
( <i>chittering</i> )

19:30.936 --> 19:31.969
( <i>yelling</i> )

19:31.971 --> 19:33.204
We're too late!

19:34.273 --> 19:35.773
( <i>screams</i> )

19:38.210 --> 19:40.111
( <i>yells</i> )

19:40.113 --> 19:41.746
( <i>grunts</i> )

19:41.748 --> 19:42.346
How did that...?

19:42.348 --> 19:43.281
Did you outfit

19:43.283 --> 19:44.882
my clothes with gadgets

19:44.884 --> 19:46.117
when I wasn't looking?

19:46.119 --> 19:47.385
Mm-hmm. Yep.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.353
Rufus, you are one
rocking mole rat.

19:50.255 --> 19:51.255
K.P.!

19:51.257 --> 19:54.192
K.P.? Don't try
and trick me, boy.

19:54.194 --> 19:56.761
I know Kim Possible
when I see her.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.896
Yeah, the lame outfit
is always a dead giveaway.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.831
( <i>grunts</i> )

20:10.108 --> 20:11.275
Falling bookcases...

20:11.277 --> 20:13.244
Yeah, you'll have
to do better than that.

20:13.246 --> 20:14.278
Suits me.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.714
Suits of armor, that is.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.916
Armors, advance!

20:18.918 --> 20:20.251
RON:
Armor?

20:21.386 --> 20:22.887
What happened
to your regular henchmen?

20:22.889 --> 20:24.455
DRAKKEN:
They're at a wedding.

20:24.457 --> 20:25.756
( <i>laughs</i> )

20:27.359 --> 20:28.726
Jump!

20:41.206 --> 20:44.008
( <i>grunting</i> )

20:44.010 --> 20:45.076
( <i>gasps</i> )

20:46.044 --> 20:46.944
( <i>screams</i> )

20:48.880 --> 20:51.415
( <i>screams</i> )

20:53.418 --> 20:55.286
Don't just stand there,
finish them.

20:58.890 --> 20:59.890
Hey, look, it works!

20:59.892 --> 21:01.025
My doomsday device works!

21:01.027 --> 21:03.494
DRAKKEN ( <i>screaming</i> ):
No!

21:07.065 --> 21:07.798
RON:
Look out!

21:11.870 --> 21:13.471
( <i>grunts</i> )

21:13.473 --> 21:16.807
( <i>engine whine slows</i> )

21:16.809 --> 21:18.242
Nice move, genius.

21:18.244 --> 21:20.845
I am what I is.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.446
Hey!

21:22.448 --> 21:24.882
This isn't over, Kim Possible.

21:24.884 --> 21:27.385
You capture us,
we'll just come back

21:27.387 --> 21:29.086
more evil than before.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.354
<i>Eviler!</i>

21:30.356 --> 21:31.422
<i>More eviler?</i>

21:31.424 --> 21:32.790
<i>Less not-gooder?</i>

21:32.792 --> 21:34.458
SHEGO:
<i>Please stop talking.</i>

21:34.460 --> 21:38.396
Ron:
<i>X =... let's see.</i>

21:38.398 --> 21:39.430
<i>Eight?</i>

21:39.432 --> 21:41.299
You know something,
Potential Boy?

21:41.301 --> 21:42.566
That's actually right.

21:42.568 --> 21:44.068
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.336
Algebra's cake for a guy

21:45.338 --> 21:47.038
who can build
a doomsday machine.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.506
Speaking of doomsday,

21:48.508 --> 21:50.808
how much detention time
did Miss Wisp give you?

21:50.810 --> 21:52.343
Well, let me put it this way.

21:52.345 --> 21:54.145
On my detention slip
she just wrote

21:54.147 --> 21:56.847
one of those sideways eight,
infinity symbol things.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.349
And what about
our rodent genius?

21:58.351 --> 22:00.384
Has the Phoebus effect
worn off yet?

22:00.386 --> 22:01.986
I'm not sure.
Where is Rufus anyway?

22:01.988 --> 22:04.221
Okay, little smart guy,

22:04.223 --> 22:05.323
there can be only one.

22:05.325 --> 22:06.390
Shall we begin?

22:06.392 --> 22:08.426
Bring it on.

22:08.428 --> 22:11.462
Plot the eliptical orbit
of Jupiter's third moon.

22:11.464 --> 22:12.830
Correct.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.265
Name the four capitals
of the ancient...

22:14.267 --> 22:15.533
Mm, I don't miss it.

22:15.535 --> 22:16.934
Correct.
