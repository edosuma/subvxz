- To the books?
- Sports books.

but I gotta do it here.

So, I gotta send guys that run
and take the money down there

08:51.416 --> 08:52.416
and make the bets for me.

08:52.550 --> 08:54.879
Maybe that's something you could do
if you come down here to work.

- Come on, it was one bet.

49:46.116 --> 49:47.741
Just one bet?
Oh, is that what it was?

49:47.882 --> 49:49.541
- Yeah, it was just one bet!
- What do you know about gambling?

49:49.682 --> 49:51.080
Do you think you understand
how this works?

49:51.215 --> 49:53.977
How my business works?
You don't. Get out!

49:54.116 --> 49:57.809
Just get out! Get, get out!

49:57.949 --> 50:00.608
Help her out. You, too. Get out!
You, too. Scott!

50:00.749 --> 50:03.715
Get out! Get out! Hurry up!
Get your fucking bag!

50:03.849 --> 50:05.815
- Get out! Get out!
- OK, we're going!

50:05.949 --> 50:08.142
Scott, go! Please! Get out!

50:09.716 --> 50:10.875
Oh, my God, what was that?

50:11.016 --> 50:12.914
He's been firing everybody
every couple of days.

50:13.049 --> 50:15.072
- Only lasts an hour or two.
- Why is he being like this?

50:15.215 --> 50:17.695
- It's like he's not Dink.
- That is Dink. That is Dink losing.

50:17.782 --> 50:19.543
Bad, like he could be headed
towards a broke

50:19.682 --> 50:21.362
if he doesn't pull out
of this debt spiral.

50:21.382 --> 50:22.973
Well, what do we do?
How do we help him?

50:23.116 --> 50:24.775
There's nothing
we can do for him.

50:24.916 --> 50:26.313
What do you mean? What are we
going to do if he goes broke?

50:26.449 --> 50:27.972
Go to work for somebody else.

You should know that by now.

50:32.182 --> 50:34.705
- This is gambling.
- They call this gambling for a reason.

50:34.849 --> 50:36.439
Yeah, I just... I didn't think...

50:36.582 --> 50:37.639
Didn't think what?
That it'd happen to Dink?

in the world, man.

- All right.

You're buying, though,
you cheap bastard.

51:03.349 --> 51:06.338
You were supposed to bring it back.

51:07.782 --> 51:11.044
Bring what back?
Your luck?

51:13.682 --> 51:16.773
I can't do that.
It's not my responsibility.

51:19.248 --> 51:22.681
So you're just going to leave me now
when I'm falling apart?

51:24.949 --> 51:27.938
Well, I can't stay here
when you're like this. It's too...

51:29.116 --> 51:31.048
...depressing.

51:31.182 --> 51:34.307
You are a very selfish person.

51:35.215 --> 51:36.476
What?

51:36.615 --> 51:40.809
Hey, what do you want me to do?

51:41.449 --> 51:44.472
What do you want me to do?

51:44.615 --> 51:48.048
Take it.
I accept your resignation.

51:49.415 --> 51:52.973
It's been nice knowing you.
Bye, Beth.

51:53.116 --> 51:55.877
Hey Dink, you sure you want to be
giving away money right now?

51:56.016 --> 51:58.447
Just get out.

51:58.582 --> 52:04.208
If you want to quit,
that's fine. OK?

52:04.349 --> 52:08.372
Just don't go do one of your stupid
hustles for money.

52:08.515 --> 52:12.607
- Mm-hm.
- Just go do something.

52:12.749 --> 52:15.214

...would you hang out with me?

53:11.949 --> 53:16.210
I mean, there are people with MBAs
waiting tables at the Olive Garden.

53:16.349 --> 53:18.542
What is someone going
to hire me to do?

53:18.682 --> 53:20.614
How did you finagle
getting your job?

53:20.749 --> 53:22.977
Well, it wasn't exactly
a finagling kind of thing.

53:23.116 --> 53:24.706
Well then, what was it?

53:24.849 --> 53:25.930
It's what I've always done.

53:25.982 --> 53:28.812

I interned, and I got a job.

It's not crazy.

You're lucky.

53:40.049 --> 53:42.947
Look, you just got out
of a shitty situation.

53:43.083 --> 53:44.878
- You got fired...
- I didn't get fired.

53:45.016 --> 53:49.414
- You quit.
- I don't know what happened.

53:50.782 --> 53:52.145
I gotta say,

53:52.282 --> 53:56.113
I don't want to be around him
if he can be like that.

53:56.248 --> 53:59.612
I don't want to see him like that.

- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

54:09.382 --> 54:13.144
For bitching and moaning.
I'll find something to do.

54:13.282 --> 54:16.078
Six months ago, all I wanted to do
was be a cocktail waitress.

54:16.215 --> 54:18.579
And now you want something more.
That's a good thing, right?

54:18.716 --> 54:21.238
Yes, definitely.

You're so... great, Jeremy.

- No, but you do not bet like Dink.

how big Rosie's bets are?

58:21.515 --> 58:24.208
It's New York,
where gambling is illegal

58:24.349 --> 58:26.212
and bookmaking is a felony.

You know, because of you
I'm finally good at something,

58:28.549 --> 58:31.481

59:47.716 --> 59:49.306
I like it when they keep winning.

59:49.449 --> 59:51.972
That means when they lose,
they lose huge.

59:52.115 --> 59:53.445
Rosie, do you ever worry

59:53.582 --> 59:56.810

by the police or the FBI?

59:56.949 --> 59:58.938
Eh, never happen.

No, you're not.

while you take bets on the phone.

01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:08.981

Everybody knows you're a bookie.

01:00:13.515 --> 01:00:16.038
I do not like having
these kinds of conversations.

And, Beth, I think you know that.

01:00:18.282 --> 01:00:21.976
And, besides, as far as
what is legal or not legal,

01:00:22.115 --> 01:00:24.308
it's about to become a moot point,
but I will not talk about that.

01:00:24.449 --> 01:00:26.176
Because that...
that is a secret!

01:00:30.215 --> 01:00:31.545
Tell me.

01:00:31.682 --> 01:00:34.204
OK, the Curacao thing

01:00:54.182 --> 01:00:56.876

You're back. You are back.

01:01:20.615 --> 01:01:22.240
Two weeks ago,
she looked like a mess.

01:01:22.382 --> 01:01:24.814
But I thought she was starting to get
her head around the whole thing.

Ruby Lane...

01:01:30.449 --> 01:01:32.438

Well, I'm not really talking
to Dink right now.

01:01:37.549 --> 01:01:40.310
Beth, you made a lot of money
in the last couple of months.

01:01:40.449 --> 01:01:41.642
Why don't you just
stay here with me?

01:01:41.782 --> 01:01:43.304
And do what?

01:01:43.449 --> 01:01:45.472
Continue to have
the completely fantastic time

01:01:45.615 --> 01:01:46.546

01:01:46.682 --> 01:01:47.978
Look, Jeremy,
I don't think you realize

01:01:48.115 --> 01:01:51.206
what a huge deal
this Curacao thing is for me.

01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:55.406
I mean, I'm going to actually
be in charge of something.

01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:57.509
Something that's going
to take you someplace else.

01:01:57.549 --> 01:02:00.572
Yeah, but I'll come back.
I'll miss you.

01:02:03.415 --> 01:02:05.608
- So, what about...?
- Otis. I know.

01:02:05.749 --> 01:02:07.874
I have to find somewhere
for him to stay.

01:02:08.015 --> 01:02:10.535
I'll take care of Otis. I don't
want him to stay with strangers.

01:02:10.582 --> 01:02:11.980
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:02:12.115 --> 01:02:14.547
Oh, my God, that would be great.
He loves you.

01:02:14.682 --> 01:02:16.443
- You know that, right?
- And I love him.

Otis, you lucky dog.

01:02:22.048 --> 01:02:25.708
Now my only problem is finding
someone to do my pay and collects.

01:02:25.849 --> 01:02:29.246
Hey. You could do that, too.

01:02:29.382 --> 01:02:31.041
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:02:31.182 --> 01:02:33.614
You can keep my cut and feed Otis,

01:02:33.749 --> 01:02:35.772
It's easy money.

01:02:35.916 --> 01:02:38.211
I'll talk you through the whole thing.

01:02:55.882 --> 01:02:57.848
Bye.

01:03:00.515 --> 01:03:02.538
So, what's your number?

01:03:02.682 --> 01:03:04.375
I'm gonna have a plain burger.

01:03:04.515 --> 01:03:06.777
No bun, no sauce,
no nothing on it.

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:08.142
I know.

01:03:08.282 --> 01:03:09.962
It had some barbecue sauce
on it last time,

01:03:10.015 --> 01:03:11.743
and I really don't want
to go through that again.

01:03:11.882 --> 01:03:14.347
So a very plain burger
and nothing else,

01:03:14.482 --> 01:03:16.243
and a regular Coke.

01:03:16.382 --> 01:03:18.314
- Got it.
- Thanks.

01:03:18.449 --> 01:03:20.915
- Stomach?
- Oh, yeah.

01:03:21.048 --> 01:03:24.139
Why? What's on your mind?
You're doing so good.

01:03:24.282 --> 01:03:27.646
Yeah, yeah. I'm just
a little worried about Beth.

01:03:27.782 --> 01:03:29.611
Dink.

01:03:29.749 --> 01:03:32.408
She's working for that maniac
Rosie in New York.

01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:36.208
I blew up at her, and now
she's not calling me back.

01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:38.212
Look, I wasn't going to say anything,
but do you notice

01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:41.577
when Beth is around,
you were doing a lot of losing.

01:03:41.716 --> 01:03:45.045
And now that she's gone,
you're doing really good.

01:03:45.182 --> 01:03:47.808
Hey, if anyone's the jinx,
it's Beth.

01:03:48.749 --> 01:03:49.874
But I owe her.

01:03:50.015 --> 01:03:51.709
Owe her for what?

01:03:51.849 --> 01:03:53.974
I owe her for messing everything up.

01:03:54.115 --> 01:03:57.912
I usually just think about
how much money I could've made

01:03:58.048 --> 01:04:00.742
if I'd just focused just a little bit
more when I was younger.

01:04:00.882 --> 01:04:02.814
And I usually give myself
a hard time about it.

01:04:03.816 --> 01:04:07.441
But now, I'm looking at all the things
that I got to do instead.

01:04:07.582 --> 01:04:09.775
I got to be with you.

01:04:10.682 --> 01:04:15.046
And it's not like I don't appreciate you
on a daily basis, because I do.

01:04:15.182 --> 01:04:17.740
But for the first time
since our wedding,

01:04:17.882 --> 01:04:19.279
I look at my situation,

01:04:19.415 --> 01:04:22.210
and I'm looking at it
from an oddsmaker's perspective.

01:04:22.349 --> 01:04:24.941
And I am a really lucky guy.

01:04:28.415 --> 01:04:32.177
And to be honest, a big part of that
is because of Beth.

No, no. It's not not a big deal.

01:09:40.215 --> 01:09:41.613
That's just Rosie saying that,

01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:43.374
so you'll forget about it
and go back to work.

01:09:43.515 --> 01:09:46.606
Look, I'm sorry
that I abandoned you.

01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:48.975
Now will you please calm down
and talk to me.

01:09:49.115 --> 01:09:51.581
I appreciate your apology.

01:09:51.716 --> 01:09:56.546
But I want you to know
this is a very serious situation, OK?

01:09:56.682 --> 01:10:00.739
You have a felon,
the parole, the FBI...

01:10:00.882 --> 01:10:03.780
I've seen things go down
just like this in the past,

01:10:03.915 --> 01:10:07.848
and I'm not just talking
about my circumstances, OK?

01:10:07.981 --> 01:10:10.106
<i>This is a very big problem.</i>

01:10:10.248 --> 01:10:12.441
How is it down there?

01:10:12.582 --> 01:10:15.309
What the heck's going on?

01:10:15.449 --> 01:10:18.244
I'm earning $5,000 a week.

01:10:18.382 --> 01:10:19.972
<i>Beth, you never cared about money.</i>

01:10:20.948 --> 01:10:22.988
I thought you went down there
because it's paradise.

01:10:23.782 --> 01:10:25.441
<i>Is it paradise?</i>

01:10:26.215 --> 01:10:28.942
<font color="#D900D9">(SOBBING)</font> No.
<i>- Don't cry.</i>

01:10:29.082 --> 01:10:31.071
<i>Don't cry, just...</i>

01:10:31.215 --> 01:10:34.477
Listen to me, Beth. You are
the book in this New York thing.

01:10:34.615 --> 01:10:36.478
You have got to
take care of your people.

01:10:36.615 --> 01:10:40.047
Your decisions are no longer
just about you anymore.

01:10:40.182 --> 01:10:41.142
You have to handle this.

01:10:41.248 --> 01:10:44.112
<font color="#D900D9">(SOBBING)</font> But I don't know
how to handle it.

01:10:45.282 --> 01:10:49.112
Yes, you do, or you will.

01:10:51.382 --> 01:10:53.109

01:11:02.749 --> 01:11:04.442
but she... she hates flying.

01:11:04.582 --> 01:11:05.822
So, if we come out to New York,

01:11:05.849 --> 01:11:07.508
she doesn't have to come out here
for her birthday,

01:11:07.649 --> 01:11:09.842
which she'd love, right, honey?

01:11:09.981 --> 01:11:10.969
Yeah.

01:11:11.948 --> 01:11:13.914
We could meet you there.

Yes, we'll help you help Jeremy.

01:11:28.782 --> 01:11:33.271
Hey, you know when you don't
need to be taken care of anymore?

01:11:33.415 --> 01:11:37.541
It's when you decide to start
taking care of someone else.

01:11:43.248 --> 01:11:45.009
You still there, Beth?

01:11:48.849 --> 01:11:50.439
Beth, you're being crazy.

01:11:50.582 --> 01:11:53.070
It's 75,000 grand
this idiot Greenberg owes me.

01:11:53.215 --> 01:11:56.579
Who cares? I need you here.
I forgive you the Greenberg.

01:11:56.716 --> 01:11:58.705
A clean slate,
you owe me nothing.

01:11:58.849 --> 01:12:00.905
- But you have to stay.
- It's not about the money.

01:12:01.048 --> 01:12:03.571
Well, what's it about?
Jerry, the non-boyfriend?

01:12:03.716 --> 01:12:06.943
Jeremy may be in huge trouble
because of me.

01:12:07.082 --> 01:12:08.048
He chose to do something

01:12:08.182 --> 01:12:09.983
not completely legal
in the state of New York.

01:12:10.115 --> 01:12:14.070
- You didn't force him to do that!
- Yeah, well, he did it for me!

01:12:15.115 --> 01:12:18.240
Come on, Beth!
People do things for themselves.

01:12:18.382 --> 01:12:22.144
Yeah, what about saints
and famously selfless people?

01:12:22.282 --> 01:12:25.077
They do things so people think
that they're saints or selfless people.

01:12:25.215 --> 01:12:26.806
People do things for themselves.

01:12:26.948 --> 01:12:28.937
Being nice,
that's just another racket!

01:12:29.082 --> 01:12:30.048
Now, listen to me, Beth.

01:12:30.182 --> 01:12:32.909
I forgive the 75,000
as long as you stay.

01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:34.605
What does that mean?

01:12:34.749 --> 01:12:39.306
It means if you stay,
you're Beth. My Beth.

01:12:39.449 --> 01:12:41.540
And all is forgiven.

01:12:41.682 --> 01:12:44.079
But if you leave,

01:12:44.215 --> 01:12:47.375
well, then you're just another
New York agent

01:12:47.515 --> 01:12:51.345
on the hook for her losers' losses.

01:12:52.215 --> 01:12:53.874
Fuck you, Rosie!

01:12:54.015 --> 01:12:56.481
No, actually, Beth.
Fuck you!

01:12:56.615 --> 01:12:58.944
All of your pay
is in the ASAP account.

01:12:59.082 --> 01:13:01.207
Which means, I have it!

01:13:01.349 --> 01:13:03.871
It's like, what is it?
Is it 60,000, give or take?

01:13:04.015 --> 01:13:06.311
So you're just going
to steal my money from me?

01:13:06.449 --> 01:13:07.710
Of course not.

01:13:07.849 --> 01:13:12.747
I'm going to hold on to it
as collateral for your losers' losses.

01:13:12.881 --> 01:13:15.712
You wanna go to New York? Fine.

01:13:15.849 --> 01:13:17.905
Give me my Greenberg money!

01:13:18.048 --> 01:13:20.241
Then you get your Beth money!

01:13:20.382 --> 01:13:22.041
You know, I am going
to deal with it.

01:13:22.182 --> 01:13:23.546
And then I'm going
to come back to you,

01:13:23.682 --> 01:13:25.909
and then I am going to...

01:13:26.048 --> 01:13:30.071
...stab you in the groin artery
with a steak knife

01:13:30.215 --> 01:13:34.807
and watch TV while you bleed out,
you fucking horrible person!

01:13:34.948 --> 01:13:36.269
- Come on, let's go.
- Whoa, Beth!

01:13:36.382 --> 01:13:39.644
I think everyone is saying things here
that they don't mean, except for me!

01:13:39.782 --> 01:13:42.906

There's 8,000 David Greenbergs
in Long Island.

01:14:55.115 --> 01:14:57.979
That's the name he's listed under,
if he's listed at all.

01:14:58.115 --> 01:15:01.639
Why? Why would you
put all your money

01:15:01.782 --> 01:15:03.304

...try not to worry.

Why are you doing this?

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:22.315
We're just here visiting family.

01:15:22.449 --> 01:15:23.889
You already got a felony conviction.

01:15:24.015 --> 01:15:26.243
If this thing doesn't go down nicely
and you're anywhere nearby,

01:15:26.382 --> 01:15:28.742
you're going to go to prison
for a lot longer than we would.

01:15:28.782 --> 01:15:31.304
Well, then let's just stop.
Let's just give up, right now.

01:15:31.449 --> 01:15:32.745
Anyway, we can't even
find Dave Greenberg...

01:15:32.881 --> 01:15:34.211

- You do? Let me see, let me see.

How did you...?

01:15:40.449 --> 01:15:42.290
I have access
to a government Web site at work,

01:15:42.382 --> 01:15:44.280
and I can get in a lot of trouble
for showing you this,

01:15:44.415 --> 01:15:45.346
but that's Greenberg.

01:15:45.482 --> 01:15:47.879
It's everything. It's his home address,
property records,

01:15:48.015 --> 01:15:50.379
employment records, phone numbers,
family, everything.

01:15:50.515 --> 01:15:51.276
I can never lay a hand
on this douche

01:15:51.415 --> 01:15:52.903
because of my personal relationship
with God,

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:54.639
but I know two guys
about four stops from here

01:15:54.782 --> 01:15:56.940
who'll come and threaten
to saw his feet off for $900.

01:15:57.082 --> 01:15:57.741
Yes.

01:15:57.881 --> 01:15:58.904
If you're seriously considering
doing something like that,

01:15:59.048 --> 01:16:00.639
I'm going to take the file and leave.

01:16:00.782 --> 01:16:03.111
- Why, is he some kind of cop?
- No, he's a reporter.

01:16:03.248 --> 01:16:05.373
Greenberg has a felony conviction.

01:16:05.515 --> 01:16:07.071
And he's on parole.

01:16:07.215 --> 01:16:09.613
That's very bad.

01:16:09.749 --> 01:16:11.772
We can't go anywhere near this guy.

01:16:11.915 --> 01:16:14.040
And, if he's working with the Feds,

01:16:14.182 --> 01:16:17.046
we can't even walk on his lawn
without getting in trouble.

on the phone.

01:16:30.349 --> 01:16:32.338

I'll call you" bullshit.

01:16:51.048 --> 01:16:51.742
