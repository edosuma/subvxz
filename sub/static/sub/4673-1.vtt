<i>Do you ever pretend you're dead
at home, just practise?</i>

00:33.917 --> 00:37.042
<i>Do you ever pretend you're dead
in the bath...</i>

00:37.167 --> 00:40.001
<i>just hold your nose and float around
like a bloated corpse?</i>

00:45.376 --> 00:49.209
<i>Have you ever contemplated suicide</i>

00:49.334 --> 00:51.792
<i>just because you're
in a convenient spot to do it?</i>

00:54.501 --> 00:57.084
<i>You're not particularly unhappy...</i>

00:57.209 --> 01:00.959
<i>'Yeah, that'd work,
if I was going to do it.'</i>

01:01.084 --> 01:03.917
<i>Like, I was bushwalking the other day
with some friends.</i>

01:04.042 --> 01:07.209
<i>It was a beautiful day.
We were all connecting and chatting.</i>

01:07.334 --> 01:09.667
<i>We went on this big ridge,
we looked at the horizon.</i>

01:09.792 --> 01:13.417
<i>There's a huge drop. I looked over,
and the voice in my head went, 'Jump.'</i>

01:15.376 --> 01:17.834
<i>'What?' 'You heard me.'</i>

01:17.959 --> 01:19.667
<i>'Why?' 'You know why.'</i>

01:21.542 --> 01:24.126
<i>I was making some toast
the other morning.</i>

01:24.251 --> 01:29.667
<i>Had the knife in my hand, looking at
the toaster, waiting for it to come up.</i>

01:29.792 --> 01:32.584
<i>The voice said, 'Stick it in.'</i>

01:32.709 --> 01:34.417
<i>'Why?' 'You know why.'</i>

01:38.001 --> 01:39.376
<i>I blame my father.</i>

01:39.501 --> 01:42.626
<i>People always say to me, 'Where do you
get your sense of humour from?'</i>

01:42.751 --> 01:44.251
<i>I say, 'My old man,'</i>

01:44.376 --> 01:47.876
<i>'cause I figured out early on that there
was something really wrong with him.</i>

01:58.334 --> 02:02.042
<i>She goes,
'You're better looking in real life.'</i>

02:02.167 --> 02:04.126
<i>Sounds like a compliment.</i>

02:07.376 --> 02:11.334
<i>What it means is,
'Because on TV, you look like shit.'</i>

02:11.459 --> 02:15.834
<i>You know, my whole life,
I've tried to improve myself,</i>

02:15.959 --> 02:19.334
<i>ever since I was a young kid. I used to
read a lot, try and make myself better.</i>

02:19.459 --> 02:25.042
<i>You know what I've realised now that
I'm older? You can't. It's hopeless.</i>

02:25.167 --> 02:28.751
<i>You'll never be anything different than
what you are.</i>

02:28.876 --> 02:31.042
<i>It's a happy story!</i>

02:35.501 --> 02:37.001
<i>When I was a kid...</i>

02:37.126 --> 02:41.126
<i>For a long time, I thought my mother
was dead, when I was a kid.</i>

02:41.251 --> 02:45.084
<i>I walked in the lounge room... 'Dad?'
He goes, 'What?'</i>

02:45.209 --> 02:46.834
<i>'Where's Mum?' 'Your mother?</i>

02:46.959 --> 02:49.334
<i>She went mad and shot herself.'</i>

02:51.792 --> 02:53.292
<i>I was eight.</i>

02:57.542 --> 03:02.167
<i>I recently went to an old girlfriend's
wedding. I don't recommend it.</i>

03:02.292 --> 03:05.084
<i>I thought it'd be cool,
going to an old girlfriend's wedding.</i>

03:05.209 --> 03:09.042
<i>It's all a bit French and everything...
'Cool. We're all happy now.'</i>

03:09.167 --> 03:10.667
<i>Shit.</i>

03:10.792 --> 03:16.417
<i>The predominant feeling at
an old girlfriend's wedding is, failure.</i>

03:16.542 --> 03:20.626
<i>Look at the happy couple on the altar.
'She's happy now.</i>

03:20.751 --> 03:24.167
<i>I've never seen her smile
like that before.'</i>

03:27.334 --> 03:33.167
<i>I've still got old girlfriends' numbers
in my phone. I can't let go.</i>

03:33.292 --> 03:37.126
<i>Some part of me thinks,
'Maybe we'll get back together.</i>

03:37.251 --> 03:40.876
<i>Maybe I'll ring them, drunk,
at two in the morning...</i>

03:41.001 --> 03:45.376
<i>'Hey! How are you?
I've been thinking about you lately.</i>

03:45.501 --> 03:47.042
<i>Let's have a kid.'</i>

03:55.167 --> 03:58.751
What can I say
about this fella? I mean...

03:58.876 --> 04:00.376
We both met starting out,

04:00.501 --> 04:04.001
and it's just been
an absolute pleasure, watching him grow.

04:04.126 --> 04:08.667
I love him like a brother, and I'd like
to propose a toast to my friend.

04:08.792 --> 04:12.376
Manny, congratulations
on a really successful tour, mate.

04:12.501 --> 04:14.334
Here's to Manny.

04:14.459 --> 04:16.541
Thanks, everyone. Cheers.

04:20.041 --> 04:22.251
Is your old man coming?

04:22.376 --> 04:24.376
Nah. Knew he wouldn't.

04:24.501 --> 04:27.376
- Never does.
- Ah.

04:27.501 --> 04:31.667
Oh, anyway,
let's just go and enjoy ourselves, eh?

04:31.792 --> 04:33.292
Yeah.

04:33.417 --> 04:35.167
Come on, get into it.

04:35.292 --> 04:37.251
I can't be bothered.

04:37.376 --> 04:38.917
Mate, you need a woman.

04:39.042 --> 04:41.042
Who are half these people, anyway?

04:41.167 --> 04:44.084
It doesn't matter. There's some
fucking gold in there, mate.

04:44.209 --> 04:45.709
Yeah.

04:45.834 --> 04:48.959
Just come and meet some of them.
Come on.

04:49.084 --> 04:52.542
Come on, mate. Just go and have a dance!

04:52.667 --> 04:54.834
Come on!

04:54.959 --> 04:57.209
I really connect to everything you say.

04:57.334 --> 05:01.167
Thanks.
I appreciate that, but it's just jokes.

05:01.292 --> 05:02.959
No, you don't understand.

05:03.084 --> 05:05.209
What you say is the truth.

05:05.334 --> 05:06.834
You mean, like a prophet?

05:06.959 --> 05:09.126
Yes, you are, in a way.

05:09.251 --> 05:12.001
Would it be strange
if I asked you for a hug?

05:12.126 --> 05:13.834
Probably.

05:13.959 --> 05:16.167
OK. Ah, sorry.

05:16.292 --> 05:17.792
Nah, it's alright.

05:19.001 --> 05:20.501
Anyway, um...

05:22.792 --> 05:27.626
When we had hangovers,
we would have these Manny days.

05:27.751 --> 05:32.209
We'd all get together and make these
really strong bloody Marys

05:32.334 --> 05:33.917
and watch your DVDs.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.792
What, you only find me funny
when you're drunk?

05:38.126 --> 05:39.626
No, no. I...

05:41.709 --> 05:43.584
So, are you, like,

05:43.709 --> 05:45.709
a manic depressive?

05:45.834 --> 05:48.417
- Yeah, I am, a bit.
- So am I.

05:48.542 --> 05:51.084
No, I'm not really. Sorry.

05:54.501 --> 05:58.334
Apparently, you need, like, four hugs
a day to actually survive.

05:58.459 --> 06:01.209
If you don't get hugs,
if people don't get hugs,

06:01.334 --> 06:03.042
they can actually die.

06:04.042 --> 06:07.417
How do you know? How do you know
if it's manic depression?

06:07.542 --> 06:10.834
You might just be miserable.
Misery's not a disease.

06:10.959 --> 06:12.459
It's just misery.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.792
Nothing wrong with being miserable,

06:16.917 --> 06:19.834
unless you hang around
a bunch of happy people.

06:19.959 --> 06:21.584
- They shit me.
- Do they?

06:21.709 --> 06:23.792
Yeah. Happy people shit me.

06:24.792 --> 06:26.334
You don't shit me.

06:26.459 --> 06:27.959
Thank you.

06:28.084 --> 06:30.459
'Cause you look like how I feel.

06:31.626 --> 06:34.751
You To Me Are Everything

06:45.292 --> 06:49.001
Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again?

06:52.126 --> 06:55.126
I'm Not Coming Back

07:05.667 --> 07:08.584
What are you doing out here, mate?
There's girls in there.

07:08.709 --> 07:10.626
What am <i>I</i> going to do with them?

07:10.751 --> 07:12.501
Have sex with one of them.

07:12.626 --> 07:14.167
I might just go home.

07:16.042 --> 07:18.417
I've got some good news for you.

07:19.792 --> 07:22.042
That's Joel Hillman.

07:22.167 --> 07:23.876
- Who?
- Joel Hillman.

07:24.001 --> 07:26.667
- The American promoter. Remember?
- Oh! Yeah, yeah.

07:26.792 --> 07:28.667
Mate, the big US tour's coming off.

07:28.792 --> 07:30.292
Yeah, right. Yeah.

07:31.917 --> 07:33.417
You're a classic, mate.

07:33.542 --> 07:35.042
What?

07:35.167 --> 07:37.584
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm alright.

07:37.709 --> 07:39.209
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:40.334 --> 07:42.876
- Cheers, mate.
- Cheers, mate.

07:43.001 --> 07:44.709
All good.

07:46.126 --> 07:47.834
America, here we come.

07:50.501 --> 07:52.209
I've never been there.

07:54.376 --> 07:56.334
They shouldn't let you in.

08:48.376 --> 08:53.459
<i>You know how they say, 'Smile,
and the whole world smiles with you'?</i>

08:53.584 --> 08:57.709
<i>No, they don't. They think
there's something wrong with you.</i>

08:57.834 --> 09:00.042
<i>I see someone walking down the street,
smiling,</i>

09:00.167 --> 09:02.876
<i>the first thing I think is, 'Drugs.'</i>

09:04.917 --> 09:08.751
<i>If you see someone happy, you think
there's something wrong with them.</i>

09:08.876 --> 09:11.626
<i>You don't notice all the miserable,
unhappy people though.</i>

09:11.751 --> 09:14.167
<i>They fade in the background,
because that's normal.</i>

09:15.709 --> 09:17.917
<i>You know, when you're famous...</i>

09:18.042 --> 09:21.001
<i>Being famous is, well,
it's hard sometimes.</i>

09:21.126 --> 09:23.042
<i>It's like you're a marked man.</i>

09:23.167 --> 09:25.542
<i>You walk the street,
people are staring at you.</i>

09:25.667 --> 09:29.292
<i>They point, whisper your name.
'There's Manny over there. Look at him.</i>

09:29.417 --> 09:31.251
<i>He's got a funny head.'</i>

09:31.376 --> 09:34.542
<i>Like you've done something wrong.
Sometimes I feel like a criminal.</i>

09:34.667 --> 09:36.626
<i>All I did was make them laugh.</i>

09:36.751 --> 09:39.167
<i>Even prostitutes recognise me.</i>

09:39.292 --> 09:44.126
<i>I walked past one the other day. 'Hey,
Manny, want to come up for a freebie?'</i>

09:44.251 --> 09:46.042
<i>'No, thanks. I'll pay.'</i>

10:18.126 --> 10:19.626
G'day, mate.

10:21.001 --> 10:22.501
How are you?

10:23.751 --> 10:25.292
You're a nice puppy.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.792
You by yourself tonight, hm?

10:30.042 --> 10:31.542
By yourself?

10:33.792 --> 10:35.334
Where's your mates?

10:36.501 --> 10:38.542
Where's your mates?

10:38.667 --> 10:40.167
Did they go on?

10:43.751 --> 10:45.251
See you next time.

10:52.209 --> 10:55.126
<i>Abs workout
targets all those flabby bits</i>

10:55.251 --> 10:56.751
<i>I just couldn't get rid of.</i>

10:56.876 --> 10:58.376
<i>I have been working out...</i>

11:25.667 --> 11:29.417
<i>Welcome to Fantasy Hotline. We're
just putting you through to our first...</i>

11:44.167 --> 11:45.876
<i>Welcome to Fantasy Hotline.</i>

11:46.001 --> 11:49.459
<i>I'm just putting you through
to our first available lady.</i>

11:49.584 --> 11:54.167
<i>The young and beautiful Caroline is
ready to take your call.</i>

11:55.709 --> 11:57.501
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello?

11:57.626 --> 12:00.126
<i>Hi. I'm Caroline.</i>

12:00.251 --> 12:01.959
<i>Who am I talking to?</i>

12:02.084 --> 12:03.834
Me. I'm... Thomas.

12:03.959 --> 12:08.501
<i>Thomas! Tell me what you
look like, Thomas.</i>

12:09.501 --> 12:12.167
I've got brown skin. I'm really tall.

12:12.292 --> 12:16.709
<i>Mmm! Tall men turn me on, Thomas.</i>

12:16.834 --> 12:21.167
Yeah. We're all tall in my family.
What do you look like?

12:21.292 --> 12:25.834
- <i>Long, leggy, curvaceous.</i>
- Oh, yeah?

12:25.959 --> 12:28.501
I love long, leggy, curvaceous.

12:28.626 --> 12:32.376
<i>Tell me, Thomas, what turns you on?</i>

12:32.501 --> 12:37.042
Whatever. I like to do anything.
What do you like?

12:37.167 --> 12:41.001
<i>Let's start with a long and slow
back massage.</i>

12:41.126 --> 12:43.876
What?
You're going to give me a back massage?

12:44.001 --> 12:46.001
<i>Oh, yeah! You'll love it.</i>

12:46.126 --> 12:49.167
- I don't really want a back massage.
- <i>You're so tense!</i>

12:49.292 --> 12:51.959
- No, I don't want one.
- <i>Let me press my thumb...</i>

12:52.084 --> 12:53.792
I said I don't want one.

12:58.042 --> 12:59.876
Back massage?

13:00.001 --> 13:02.001
I don't want a back massage!

13:02.126 --> 13:04.126
It's my money. $5 a minute.

13:04.251 --> 13:07.292
Fuck. It's cheaper
to go and get a proper massage.

13:24.417 --> 13:26.292
Hello?

13:26.417 --> 13:28.459
<i>This is</i> my <i>fantasy.</i>

13:28.584 --> 13:32.459
<i>I don't lay in bed at night thinking,
'I'd love to have a back massage</i>

13:32.584 --> 13:34.792
<i>over the phone.'</i>

13:34.917 --> 13:40.084
Well. Mm, I really upset you.

13:40.209 --> 13:42.376
Oh, sorry.

13:42.501 --> 13:44.626
Sorry I snapped at you.

13:44.751 --> 13:47.042
I just feel like talking, really.

13:49.167 --> 13:51.417
What do you want to talk about?

13:52.417 --> 13:55.834
<i>Um, back massages? Just kidding.</i>

13:56.834 --> 13:58.667
Whatever.

13:58.792 --> 14:01.042
It's better than watching TV.

14:03.084 --> 14:06.542
Thomas. Sounds like a Czech name.

14:06.667 --> 14:08.167
<i>Are you Czech?</i>

14:09.292 --> 14:10.959
I don't know.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.001
I'm a bit of everything, really.

14:13.126 --> 14:14.667
<i>I'm a mongrel.</i>

14:14.792 --> 14:17.084
Mm, sounds strong.

14:17.209 --> 14:18.709
Yeah.

14:18.834 --> 14:20.459
I got big arms.

14:21.834 --> 14:23.876
I've got a beard.

14:24.001 --> 14:25.501
I'm really manly.

14:27.876 --> 14:29.376
No, I'm not.

14:30.376 --> 14:32.542
<i>I'm bullshitting.</i>

14:32.667 --> 14:36.292
<i>I'm 5'7", bald. I've got wing nuts.</i>

14:36.417 --> 14:37.917
What's a wing nut?

14:38.042 --> 14:42.334
<i>Wing nuts. You know when your ears
stick out like a wing nut?</i>

14:42.459 --> 14:44.042
Wing nut?

14:44.167 --> 14:47.001
Yeah, that's what you call someone
with big ears... wing nuts.

14:47.126 --> 14:50.042
Anyway, that's what I've got...
fucking wing nuts.

14:51.792 --> 14:54.459
You think it's funny that
somebody's got wing nuts, do you?

14:54.584 --> 14:58.459
No! I think it's funny that
you call them 'wing nuts'.

14:58.584 --> 15:01.917
Anyway, let's get off my wing nuts.
Let's talk about something else.

15:02.042 --> 15:05.084
<i>This is supposed to be
an erotic phone call, isn't it?</i>

15:05.209 --> 15:07.209
If you want it to be.

15:07.334 --> 15:08.834
Do you want it to be?

15:09.834 --> 15:12.167
<i>Not really.</i>

15:12.292 --> 15:13.792
You're funny.

15:16.209 --> 15:19.584
Yeah, well,
that's one thing I'm good at.

15:19.709 --> 15:23.251
What, you're only good at one thing?

15:24.251 --> 15:26.167
Probably.

15:26.292 --> 15:31.417
I'm not good at anything else, really.
I mean, sometimes I feel like a loser.

15:31.542 --> 15:35.001
Yeah? Why do you feel like that?

15:35.126 --> 15:38.709
<i>Ah, let me see... it's three in the
morning, I've got the curtains drawn.</i>

15:38.834 --> 15:42.501
I'm talking to someone I don't even
know, having an erotic phone call.

15:42.626 --> 15:44.126
<i>I mean... loser.</i>

15:45.417 --> 15:47.834
I'm kind of doing the same thing.

15:47.959 --> 15:50.667
Yeah, but at least you're
getting paid for it.

15:50.792 --> 15:52.834
Anyway...

15:52.959 --> 15:56.667
it's late. Probably should go.

15:56.792 --> 15:59.876
<i>It's been nice talking to you though.
Caroline, was it?</i>

16:00.001 --> 16:02.751
Yeah. OK, Thomas.

16:02.876 --> 16:04.501
See ya.

16:04.626 --> 16:06.126
<i>Bye.</i>

16:40.167 --> 16:41.667
<i>Hello?</i>

16:41.792 --> 16:43.709
- Hello?
- <i>Hello.</i>

16:43.834 --> 16:45.917
- Is that Caroline?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

16:46.042 --> 16:48.667
<i>It's me, Wing Nuts.</i>

16:48.792 --> 16:53.001
Thomas. You're back again.

16:53.126 --> 16:54.626
Yeah.

16:57.792 --> 16:59.501
Um...

16:59.626 --> 17:01.334
do you ever...

17:01.459 --> 17:06.291
Do you guys, I mean,
people that do your thing,

17:06.416 --> 17:10.791
are you allowed to kind of meet up with
people you talk on the phone with?

17:10.916 --> 17:12.916
<i>I'm not saying
I was thinking of doing that.</i>

17:13.041 --> 17:17.584
I'm glad you're not thinking about it,
Thomas, because unfortunately, I can't.

17:17.709 --> 17:19.209
<i>I was just asking.</i>

17:19.334 --> 17:22.916
I'm not saying I was going to do it
anyway.

17:23.041 --> 17:26.041
I don't even know you. I mean,
you could be a freak or whatever.

17:28.041 --> 17:31.292
- You can always call.
- <i>Yeah, I know.</i>

17:31.417 --> 17:33.667
I feel a bit stupid now.

17:33.792 --> 17:37.792
Anyway, I'd better go to bed.
It's $5 a minute.

17:37.917 --> 17:39.667
<i>OK.</i>

17:39.792 --> 17:44.584
Anyway, I'll see you. I won't see you.
I mean, I'll...

17:44.709 --> 17:46.792
I'll talk to you, whatever.

17:48.084 --> 17:49.584
<i>OK. Bye.</i>

17:56.001 --> 17:57.501
Dickhead.

18:01.001 --> 18:02.501
Yoo!

18:03.667 --> 18:05.584
Go and score a goal, mate.

18:11.001 --> 18:12.626
How did you end up?

18:12.751 --> 18:15.292
Oh, you know, the usual.

18:15.417 --> 18:18.376
Jo was pissed off, I had a spew.

18:18.501 --> 18:20.834
Yeah, good times.

18:20.959 --> 18:23.376
You are a disaster.

18:23.501 --> 18:25.209
Yeah, I know.

18:25.334 --> 18:27.542
So how are you feeling
about your time off?

18:28.626 --> 18:30.126
Yeah.

18:30.251 --> 18:32.084
What are you going to do for two months?

18:32.209 --> 18:36.084
Dunno. Sit around, stare out the window,

18:36.209 --> 18:40.459
wonder what's happening in my life,
cup of tea, kill myself.

18:40.584 --> 18:43.709
You know, normal shit.

18:43.834 --> 18:48.042
Before you top yourself, Sad Sack,
think about the American offer.

18:48.167 --> 18:50.667
Yeah, I will. What are you going to do?

18:50.792 --> 18:52.334
I'm doing it.

18:52.459 --> 18:53.959
Come to Dad, mate!

19:00.292 --> 19:01.834
Jump on Uncle Manny.

19:01.959 --> 19:03.959
Oh! Alright.

19:04.084 --> 19:06.917
- Is that your dad?
- No.

19:07.042 --> 19:08.626
Oh, yeah.

19:08.751 --> 19:10.501
He can't say that!

19:10.626 --> 19:12.834
- I'm your real dad.
- You're not my daddy.

19:12.959 --> 19:15.251
- He's my dad.
- No, he's a drunk.

19:15.376 --> 19:19.209
No, my dad's over there,
my dad's over there!

19:20.251 --> 19:23.167
<i>You talk a lot about your father.
What does he feel about it?</i>

19:23.292 --> 19:26.209
<i>Ah, he whinges a bit.
He's always whingeing.</i>

19:26.334 --> 19:32.292
<i>He's always saying, 'Comb your hair.
It looks like a bloody half-sucked mango.'</i>

19:32.417 --> 19:37.459
<i>My head's too big for my body.
I've got no arse. I look like a foetus.</i>

19:37.584 --> 19:39.792
<i>You're being a bit hard on yourself,
Manny.</i>

19:39.917 --> 19:43.209
- <i>And I've got wing nuts.
- You really think you've got wing nuts?</i>

19:43.334 --> 19:45.001
<i>Yeah, look at them.</i>

19:45.126 --> 19:47.876
<i>Either that
or my head's too small for my ears.</i>

19:48.001 --> 19:52.042
<i>People always come up and say,
'I just look at you and laugh.'</i>

19:52.167 --> 19:54.751
<i>I don't know whether to take that
as a compliment or not.</i>

19:57.042 --> 19:59.834
Right... America.
So, do you want to do it or not?

19:59.959 --> 20:02.042
'Cause I need an answer.

20:02.167 --> 20:04.376
Yeah. Why not?

20:04.501 --> 20:07.084
OK. You know it means living there.

20:07.209 --> 20:09.417
They'll effectively own you.
Is that a problem?

20:09.542 --> 20:11.209
No. Let's go, let's go.

20:12.209 --> 20:15.834
OK. Alright,
we'll get them out here for a show.

20:15.959 --> 20:17.459
Yep.

20:17.584 --> 20:20.834
- There's just one more thing.
- What's that?

20:20.959 --> 20:24.542
They want you to go out live
on national television, the whole show.

20:24.667 --> 20:26.876
Why?

20:27.001 --> 20:28.709
To see if you can do it.

20:28.834 --> 20:30.542
- What, perform?
- Yeah.

20:30.667 --> 20:32.167
I've done it a million times.

20:32.292 --> 20:35.042
What difference does it make
if there's a camera in my face?

20:35.167 --> 20:38.584
That's just the way they do it, mate.
That's the deal.

20:38.709 --> 20:40.876
So do you want to do it or not?

20:41.001 --> 20:42.501
Yeah, I'll do it.

20:42.626 --> 20:46.084
Gold!
Alright, well, I'll book the State.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.917
What the fuck is that?

20:54.042 --> 20:55.876
Dunno, mate. Just eat it.

21:07.876 --> 21:09.917
You love your caramel slice.

21:10.042 --> 21:12.459
Yeah, just like Mum used to make.

21:15.084 --> 21:17.334
- See you, mate.
- Ciao, Manny.

21:22.501 --> 21:24.459
Ah, Hermann Hesse.

21:25.542 --> 21:27.042
It's a good book.

21:27.167 --> 21:28.834
- You've read it?
- Yeah.

21:28.959 --> 21:31.834
It's about a miserable bloke
who wants to kill himself

21:31.959 --> 21:35.584
until he meets a woman who teaches him
how to dance and enjoy life.

21:37.001 --> 21:39.167
- Well, there goes the ending.
- Oh, sorry.

21:39.292 --> 21:40.792
It's OK.

21:40.917 --> 21:43.459
Anyway, I'm Manny. I ruin novels.

21:43.584 --> 21:45.417
I'm Maria.

21:45.542 --> 21:48.584
- I think I've seen you.
- I was just here.

21:48.709 --> 21:51.917
- Anyway, I'd better get going.
- OK.

21:52.042 --> 21:54.792
Even though I've got nowhere to go.

21:54.917 --> 21:57.001
- I'll see you around.
- OK.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.459
Hey, ah...

22:08.584 --> 22:10.084
Sorry.

22:12.626 --> 22:15.292
Do you reckon I could get your number
and call you,

22:15.417 --> 22:19.251
and maybe have a coffee
and ruin another book?

22:22.376 --> 22:24.376
Um, sure.

22:24.501 --> 22:26.001
Great.

22:27.751 --> 22:29.251
Do you have a pen?

22:29.376 --> 22:31.001
No. Do you have one?

22:31.126 --> 22:32.626
No.

22:34.001 --> 22:36.126
I think Armando...

22:36.251 --> 22:37.751
Man, here!

22:39.876 --> 22:41.376
Oh. Yep.

23:24.751 --> 23:27.042
The finest comedian!

23:27.167 --> 23:28.667
How are you going, Dad?

23:28.792 --> 23:30.542
How the bloody hell are you?

23:30.667 --> 23:32.792
You finally decided
to visit your old man.

23:32.917 --> 23:35.417
- You could visit me.
- Here we go. Don't start.

23:35.542 --> 23:37.792
- You started.
- You can't argue with you, can you?

23:37.917 --> 23:39.709
You've always got to have the last word.

23:39.834 --> 23:42.001
- If I don't, you will.
- How's your shows going?

23:42.126 --> 23:44.376
- Good. You should come one time.
- I don't have to.

23:44.501 --> 23:47.626
I know what you talk about.
You talk about me half the time.

23:47.751 --> 23:50.167
It's all bloody bullshit anyway.

24:24.292 --> 24:26.209
- What's that?
- What?

24:26.334 --> 24:28.626
DVD with a naked girl on the front.

24:28.751 --> 24:31.792
Oh. Cloudy gave me that awhile back.

24:31.917 --> 24:33.542
- You ever watch it?
- Nah.

24:33.667 --> 24:35.709
Bullshit. Stick it on.

24:41.667 --> 24:43.917
You've got to be fit to do that.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.542
You had enough?

24:46.667 --> 24:48.209
You wanted to watch it.

24:48.334 --> 24:51.834
Just wanted to have a look.
I didn't want to watch the whole thing.

24:51.959 --> 24:53.501
I feel a bit sick now.

24:59.751 --> 25:01.834
Well, what do you want to do?

25:03.042 --> 25:06.334
Do you want to go out for lunch
or something?

25:06.459 --> 25:07.959
Lunch? Don't be fucking stupid!

25:08.084 --> 25:11.209
- Why's it stupid?
- Go to some bloody poofy cafe

25:11.334 --> 25:14.709
and pay ten bucks for one carrot?
There's bloody food in the fridge.

25:14.834 --> 25:16.917
Well, forget it.

25:17.042 --> 25:19.167
Do you want to go for a walk?

25:19.292 --> 25:21.667
What am I, your girlfriend?

25:23.042 --> 25:25.709
You never bring your girlfriends
out here.

25:25.834 --> 25:27.834
I would if I had one.

25:27.959 --> 25:30.876
When you going to make me a grandfather?

25:31.001 --> 25:33.501
When I get one of them pregnant.

25:37.292 --> 25:39.542
- Beer?
- Beer?

25:39.667 --> 25:41.167
It's 11:30.

25:41.292 --> 25:43.917
Didn't the doctor say
you shouldn't be drinking?

25:44.042 --> 25:45.834
Mate, I gave up smoking.

25:45.959 --> 25:48.584
Haven't had a root
since your mother died.

25:48.709 --> 25:53.876
Drinking's the only thing I've got left.
I'm drinking. Do you want one or not?

25:54.001 --> 25:55.501
Yeah, righto.

26:04.001 --> 26:06.501
Right. Ring her up, say hello,

26:06.626 --> 26:10.959
ask her how she is, try to listen
to the answer, if that's possible.

26:11.084 --> 26:14.167
Talk about the weather,
not for too long.

26:14.292 --> 26:17.959
Then just ask her out
and get the fuck off the phone.

26:27.542 --> 26:29.042
Hi. Maria speaking.

26:29.167 --> 26:33.001
Oh, hi. It's Manny from down the cafe.

26:33.126 --> 26:36.084
Oh, hi, Manny. How are you?

26:36.209 --> 26:37.709
<i>Yeah, I'm good.</i>

26:37.834 --> 26:40.959
How are you?
It was warm today, wasn't it?

26:43.959 --> 26:45.459
Yeah, a little bit.

26:47.667 --> 26:52.667
I was just wondering, are you
doing anything on Saturday night?

26:52.792 --> 26:55.751
<i>Saturday I'm busy. I'm sorry.</i>

26:56.751 --> 26:59.501
<i>Oh, OK. Well, what about Sunday?</i>

26:59.626 --> 27:02.209
No, Sunday, I'm busy all day and night.

27:03.459 --> 27:04.959
Oh.

27:06.792 --> 27:10.876
OK, well, maybe I'll just see you around
some time.

27:11.001 --> 27:13.334
Um, I'm not busy tonight.

27:14.417 --> 27:16.209
<i>If you're free tonight.</i>

27:16.334 --> 27:20.209
Yeah, I am. I forgot about tonight.
That would be good.

27:20.334 --> 27:22.126
Great!

27:22.251 --> 27:25.042
<i>Perfect! Alright, I'll see you then.</i>

27:25.167 --> 27:26.667
OK.

27:29.376 --> 27:30.917
Yeah!

27:31.042 --> 27:34.417
This Charming Man

28:18.876 --> 28:20.376
Jesus.

28:20.501 --> 28:23.251
Can you be normal tonight,
is that possible?

28:23.376 --> 28:27.251
Just be normal.
Don't tell her about your colonic.

28:27.376 --> 28:29.667
You know what,
don't even talk about your arse.

28:29.792 --> 28:33.251
Just leave your arse
out of the conversation.

28:33.376 --> 28:35.834
When she talks, listen, you know?

28:35.959 --> 28:39.751
Don't glaze over while she's talking,
otherwise you look bored.

28:39.876 --> 28:42.834
You might be a bit bored at some point.
That's cool.

28:42.959 --> 28:45.459
Just don't let on that you're bored.

28:45.584 --> 28:48.167
Don't act sexy, whatever that is.
We can't be sexy.

28:48.292 --> 28:51.376
I'm not sexy. You sexy? Nobody's sexy.

28:51.501 --> 28:54.292
Pay for the meal. That's a good idea,
'cause you asked her out.

28:54.417 --> 28:58.292
That's the law.
If you ask them out, you've got to pay.

28:58.417 --> 29:02.626
Don't shovel the food in your mouth
like a guts, even though you are a guts.

29:02.751 --> 29:06.792
Just pretend that you're not a guts,
for one night.

29:06.917 --> 29:09.251
Can you do that, please?

29:09.376 --> 29:12.042
Just be normal, alright?

29:12.167 --> 29:13.667
Normal.

29:33.209 --> 29:34.917
He always does that.

29:35.042 --> 29:36.667
First time I came here, I got beers.

29:36.792 --> 29:40.126
Now every time I come here, he gives me
beer before I have a chance to order.

29:40.251 --> 29:43.167
I kind of like it, even though
I don't feel like beer sometimes.

29:43.292 --> 29:45.042
Would you mind if I had wine?

29:45.167 --> 29:47.751
He might get pissed off.
He's from Czechoslovakia.

29:47.876 --> 29:50.459
They're all a bit depressed there.

29:51.501 --> 29:53.001
Excuse me?

29:53.126 --> 29:56.001
Could I get a glass of red wine, please?

29:56.126 --> 29:58.209
OK.

29:58.334 --> 30:02.376
It's alright. I'll have hers.
I feel like two anyway.

30:06.959 --> 30:09.042
Hey, look, it's a mandorla.

30:11.584 --> 30:14.542
- What's a mandorla?
- Mandorla is the almond shape

30:14.667 --> 30:16.709
that the two circles make
when they overlap.

30:16.834 --> 30:18.334
That's the mandorla.

30:18.459 --> 30:19.959
Right.

30:21.042 --> 30:23.251
Yo, funny guy!

30:23.376 --> 30:24.876
Mate, great!

30:26.251 --> 30:28.376
- Friend of yours?
- Yeah, no.

30:28.501 --> 30:30.501
I know him from work and stuff.

30:30.626 --> 30:32.126
I know. I've seen you perform.

30:32.251 --> 30:35.084
Oh, yeah? Hope you got a few laughs.

30:35.209 --> 30:37.959
- Yeah, I did.
- Just a few?

30:38.084 --> 30:40.042
Oh, no. I thought it was really funny.

30:40.167 --> 30:41.876
All of it?

30:42.001 --> 30:43.667
Do you like feedback about your show?

30:45.167 --> 30:48.251
Sort of. I mean,
over the years, I've heard it all.

30:48.376 --> 30:50.751
Some people say I'm great,
some people say I'm shit.

30:50.876 --> 30:54.751
No, I loved it.
Manny, I think you're really funny.

30:56.042 --> 30:57.542
But, um,

30:57.667 --> 31:01.959
if you don't mind me being honest,
you looked a bit tired.

31:05.959 --> 31:07.459
I am.

31:07.584 --> 31:10.292
20 years of telling people what I think,
what I reckon...

31:10.417 --> 31:14.834
I mean, I like making people laugh,
but I'm worn out.

31:14.959 --> 31:17.084
Anyway, what do <i>you</i> do?

31:19.084 --> 31:20.584
Um...

31:20.709 --> 31:22.417
I work in a call centre.

31:22.542 --> 31:25.042
Oh, yeah? What do you call people about?

31:25.167 --> 31:27.126
All sorts of stuff.

31:27.251 --> 31:29.459
Mysterious! What sort of stuff?

31:29.584 --> 31:33.376
Just all sorts of jobs.

31:33.501 --> 31:35.042
It's confidential.

31:35.167 --> 31:40.792
You know you've got a really nice voice?
Really feminine and calming.

31:40.917 --> 31:42.417
Thank you.

31:42.542 --> 31:44.842
If I didn't know you
and I was talking to you on the phone,

31:44.967 --> 31:47.559
I'd think you were really sexy.

31:48.084 --> 31:49.751
I wouldn't tell you what to do,

31:49.876 --> 31:52.251
but you could make a lot of money,
using your voice.

31:52.376 --> 31:54.084
There's something I should tell you.

31:54.209 --> 31:58.917
Radio commercials and GPS
and fantasy hotlines.

31:59.042 --> 32:00.542
I'm not saying you do that, but...

32:00.667 --> 32:05.917
Anyway, that's just what I reckon.
Sorry. What were you saying?

32:06.042 --> 32:10.042
I... I forget.
Thanks for saying all that.

32:16.667 --> 32:19.417
I should go.
You've probably got things to do.

32:19.542 --> 32:21.376
Oh, OK.

32:21.501 --> 32:24.626
No... I'm sure you're busy too.

32:26.251 --> 32:27.751
Yeah. Anyway...

32:27.876 --> 32:29.376
OK.

32:31.334 --> 32:34.417
I'm up for another drink if you are.

32:34.542 --> 32:36.042
Sure.

32:36.167 --> 32:37.667
Right.

32:37.792 --> 32:40.667
I know this really nice place
around the corner.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.292
Let's go.

32:42.417 --> 32:43.917
Mambo!

33:08.959 --> 33:10.501
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

33:17.501 --> 33:19.001
Mm, salt.

33:26.167 --> 33:27.876
- I love salsa.
- Yeah?

33:29.376 --> 33:31.292
What do you like about it?

33:31.417 --> 33:34.209
- Look how happy they all are.
- Yeah.

33:34.334 --> 33:36.126
- It's pretty sexy.
- Yeah.

33:36.251 --> 33:38.084
Can you salsa?

33:38.209 --> 33:41.792
Yeah, probably when I'm pissed,
do my own version.

33:43.626 --> 33:45.459
- You want to give it a go?
- Really?

33:45.584 --> 33:47.084
- Yeah.
- Ah...

33:47.209 --> 33:48.709
- Come on.
- Come on!

33:50.417 --> 33:51.917
Hang on.

33:56.417 --> 33:57.917
OK

36:41.001 --> 36:43.292
<i>Hello?</i>

36:43.417 --> 36:44.917
Hi, it's Manny.

36:45.042 --> 36:47.417
You know, the guy from the awkward hug
in the street?

36:47.542 --> 36:49.126
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:49.251 --> 36:52.834
I just wanted to say,
thanks for tonight. I enjoyed it.

36:52.959 --> 36:55.001
And um, see you soon.

36:55.126 --> 36:57.042
<i>See you soon.</i>

36:57.167 --> 37:00.626
Alright. Oh, by the way,
I'm not stalking you.

37:01.876 --> 37:03.709
Alright. See ya.

37:03.834 --> 37:05.334
<i>Bye.</i>

37:11.917 --> 37:15.042
Probably should have waited
a couple of days before I called her.

37:15.167 --> 37:18.917
Wait for what,
some other bloke to call her?

37:19.042 --> 37:21.626
I don't want to look too desperate.

37:21.751 --> 37:23.292
I <i>am</i> desperate!

37:23.417 --> 37:26.084
I don't go out with anyone.

37:26.209 --> 37:28.459
You can't look too keen.

37:28.584 --> 37:32.167
What do you want to look like, then... a
fucking zombie who doesn't give a shit?

37:32.292 --> 37:33.834
<i>That's</i> attractive.

37:47.667 --> 37:49.209
Hello?

37:49.334 --> 37:50.834
<i>Caroline?</i>

37:51.834 --> 37:53.334
Thomas?

37:54.459 --> 37:56.292
I haven't heard from you in awhile.

37:56.417 --> 37:59.251
Believe it or not, I've met a girl.

38:01.167 --> 38:02.751
How's it going?

38:02.876 --> 38:05.042
<i>Mm, good.</i>

38:05.167 --> 38:06.667
Just 'good'?

38:07.876 --> 38:09.709
<i>It's got potential.</i>

38:09.834 --> 38:12.917
<i>But, you know,
the normal stuff comes up.</i>

38:13.042 --> 38:16.292
<i>You know... you always
find something wrong with them.</i>

38:16.417 --> 38:18.042
Like what?

38:18.167 --> 38:22.667
<i>Nothing serious. Just normal stuff.
I mean, it's just boring.</i>

38:22.792 --> 38:24.917
Oh, no. This is interesting.

38:25.042 --> 38:28.292
Well, I feel bad for saying it, but...

38:28.417 --> 38:31.251
she makes this noise with her lips
when she's eating.

38:33.709 --> 38:35.209
What noise?

38:35.334 --> 38:37.042
<i>'Mm-num-num-num...'</i>

38:38.209 --> 38:39.959
<i>Drives me nuts.</i>

38:40.084 --> 38:41.584
Yeah.

38:42.876 --> 38:45.709
So what else bothers you about her?

38:45.834 --> 38:47.917
<i>She's a bit straight.</i>

38:48.042 --> 38:49.542
Straight?

38:49.667 --> 38:54.334
Yeah, just a bit old-fashioned.
But, you know, I can get around that.

38:57.376 --> 39:01.126
Well, there must be something you like
about her.

39:02.376 --> 39:04.584
Do you find her attractive?

39:04.709 --> 39:06.209
<i>Yeah.</i>

39:06.334 --> 39:09.001
Well, what do you mean, 'yeah'?

39:09.126 --> 39:13.709
<i>Well, she's not a glamour,
but I don't like glamours anyway.</i>

39:13.834 --> 39:18.292
<i>I like girls that look like
they want to make soup and watch DVDs.</i>

39:18.417 --> 39:20.792
I don't know. I always feel this way.

39:20.917 --> 39:25.626
I start going out with someone,
I feel like bolting at the same time.

39:25.751 --> 39:27.251
<i>Why?</i>

39:29.792 --> 39:33.001
Getting close to someone
and all that stuff.

39:33.126 --> 39:34.626
I just get scared.

39:37.584 --> 39:39.459
<i>But I like her.</i>

39:39.584 --> 39:42.751
<i>She looks to me in the eye
when she's talking to me.</i>

39:42.876 --> 39:46.167
<i>I've been having fun with her.
She's great.</i>

39:47.167 --> 39:50.709
Dad, can I please go
and play with the ducks, please?

39:50.834 --> 39:52.459
Yes, mate. Off you go.

39:58.792 --> 40:02.459
Ever think about leaving your wife and
kids and going back to your old life?

40:04.584 --> 40:06.292
Every day.

40:06.417 --> 40:08.667
Why don't you?

40:08.792 --> 40:10.376
'Cause I love my family.

40:10.501 --> 40:12.501
Fair enough.

40:12.626 --> 40:14.126
You should have one, you know.

40:14.251 --> 40:16.084
I reckon you'd love it.

40:16.209 --> 40:19.084
A bit of balance in your life
instead of performing all the time.

40:19.209 --> 40:23.126
Yeah, I know. I'm not against it.
Just got to get a girlfriend first.

40:23.251 --> 40:25.292
Well, stop fart-arseing around
and get one.

40:25.417 --> 40:28.376
Sure. What else am I going to do,
sit around and blow-dry my pubes?

40:32.376 --> 40:34.501
Right. So that's a yes, then?

40:34.626 --> 40:36.376
Yeah, alright.

40:38.126 --> 40:40.834
Ethan! Don't piss on the ducks, son.

41:02.959 --> 41:04.459
- Hello.
- Hi.

41:04.584 --> 41:06.084
Come in.

41:08.126 --> 41:09.626
Oh!

41:10.834 --> 41:13.167
- Wow!
- Yeah.

41:13.292 --> 41:15.834
My God, you have the harbour
<i>and</i> the city.

41:15.959 --> 41:19.376
When I'm feeling happy,
I look at the harbour

41:19.501 --> 41:22.501
and when I'm feeling depressed,
I look at the city.

41:22.626 --> 41:25.417
When I don't feel anything at all,
I just stare at the carpet.

41:25.542 --> 41:27.167
Do you want a cup of tea?

41:27.292 --> 41:28.792
That'd be great.

41:32.834 --> 41:35.292
Mm, yum!

41:35.417 --> 41:37.876
Iced VoVos. I love Iced VoVos.

41:38.001 --> 41:40.001
- Do you?
- Mm-hm.

41:40.126 --> 41:42.542
- Ever do that thing?
- What thing?

41:42.667 --> 41:45.667
You know, where you take the
pink stripes off first, then leave...

41:45.792 --> 41:47.334
I'll show you.

41:47.459 --> 41:49.584
- Watching?
- I'm watching.

41:49.709 --> 41:51.626
Mm...

41:58.042 --> 41:59.667
What's so good about the red bit?

41:59.792 --> 42:01.626
I don't know.

42:01.751 --> 42:04.709
I've been doing it since I was a kid.
It's just fun.

42:06.959 --> 42:08.459
I got a little bit of the rim.

42:08.584 --> 42:12.334
I didn't understand any of that...
'Rr-rr-rr-rp.'

42:13.334 --> 42:16.334
- What are you looking at me for?
- You've got coconut...

42:16.459 --> 42:19.626
You're not supposed to make eye contact
when you do it. Quite creepy.

42:19.751 --> 42:21.251
Good.

42:21.376 --> 42:23.459
You've got some coconut...

42:24.542 --> 42:26.667
- Yeah. I want it there.
- Just leaving it?

42:26.792 --> 42:28.584
- Yeah.
- For dinner?

42:28.709 --> 42:30.542
- For Ron.
- Who's Ron?

42:30.667 --> 42:32.334
Later on.

42:32.459 --> 42:34.126
Boom!

42:34.251 --> 42:36.876
You don't know that one? That's so old.

42:41.001 --> 42:42.501
Boom!

42:42.626 --> 42:44.126
Champion.

42:45.417 --> 42:46.917
Loser.

42:49.501 --> 42:51.001
Are you watching?

42:53.959 --> 42:55.459
Tada!

42:58.417 --> 42:59.917
What is it?

43:00.042 --> 43:02.209
It's my trick. It's the Opera House.

43:02.334 --> 43:04.459
- Oh, yeah!
- That was my trick, growing up.

43:04.584 --> 43:06.501
Oh, right. Where'd you grow up?

43:06.626 --> 43:08.126
- Gympie.
- Gympie?

43:08.251 --> 43:09.751
Gympie.

43:09.876 --> 43:13.167
- Parents still out there?
- Mum's still there.

43:13.292 --> 43:15.001
Oh, yeah? What about your old man?

43:15.126 --> 43:18.501
My dad, I haven't seen since I was 13.

43:18.626 --> 43:20.126
Oh, right.

43:28.459 --> 43:30.001
<i>♪ Shy and pretty girl</i>

43:32.834 --> 43:34.334
<i>♪ All the way</i>

43:34.459 --> 43:35.959
<i>♪ From Gympie</i>

44:06.501 --> 44:09.334
That was very sweet,
you wrote a song about me.

44:09.459 --> 44:12.542
Actually, it's about this other girl
in Gympie called Maria.

44:12.667 --> 44:14.376
Bad joke, sorry. Yeah.

44:16.084 --> 44:18.084
Um, so...

44:19.792 --> 44:21.876
what do you want to do now?

44:22.001 --> 44:24.667
I brought some soup.
I don't know if you like soup.

44:24.792 --> 44:26.751
You made soup?

44:26.876 --> 44:28.376
I love soup.

44:28.501 --> 44:31.251
And I don't know if you feel like
watching a movie.

44:31.376 --> 44:34.834
Yeah You brought a movie and soup.
Good guess.

44:34.959 --> 44:36.459
Let's watch it.

44:37.459 --> 44:42.417
She's great. We got along really well.
It was like a perfect date.

44:42.542 --> 44:45.542
- Great!
- <i>Well, not perfect.</i>

44:45.667 --> 44:47.334
<i>There's always something missing.</i>

44:47.459 --> 44:48.959
<i>Like?</i>

44:50.292 --> 44:53.792
She always has her hair up.
Kind of looks like a librarian.

44:53.917 --> 44:59.751
<i>She wears loose clothes. I mean,
what's she hiding, what's under there?</i>

44:59.876 --> 45:01.751
Who knows?

45:01.876 --> 45:03.376
<i>It's not the only thing.</i>

45:05.251 --> 45:06.751
The thing is...

45:07.959 --> 45:09.501
I think she's beautiful.

45:11.626 --> 45:13.167
<i>She doesn't know it.</i>

45:16.876 --> 45:19.584
<i>That's what I really like about her.</i>

45:35.792 --> 45:37.292
What is it?

45:39.459 --> 45:40.959
You look great.

45:41.084 --> 45:42.834
Really?

45:42.959 --> 45:44.459
Yeah!

45:44.584 --> 45:46.084
OK. Thanks.

45:47.959 --> 45:49.459
Shall we?

46:06.626 --> 46:09.251
Oh, no, this is going
to be embarrassing.

46:09.376 --> 46:11.584
Come. Armando!

46:11.709 --> 46:13.501
- Hey!
- Hey.

46:15.667 --> 46:16.709
Maria!

46:20.167 --> 46:22.084
How are you?

46:22.209 --> 46:23.709
This is Manny.

46:23.834 --> 46:26.084
- You're very muscly, very brown.
- Oh, thank you.

46:28.667 --> 46:31.084
Are you enjoying it?

46:31.209 --> 46:33.251
Yeah.

46:33.376 --> 46:35.584
It's kind of like beans and meat,
really.

46:35.709 --> 46:37.626
It's feijoada.

46:37.751 --> 46:39.251
Fezh-what?

46:39.376 --> 46:40.876
Feijoada.

46:41.001 --> 46:44.126
Sounds like you're saying, 'Fish water'.

46:46.292 --> 46:47.834
Aren't they great?

46:51.209 --> 46:52.751
Yeah. No, it's good.

46:52.876 --> 46:54.667
Bit loud, don't you reckon?

46:54.792 --> 46:58.167
They offered me a spot on the boat
back to Hio.

47:00.042 --> 47:01.667
Back to where?

47:01.792 --> 47:03.584
Rio de Janeiro.

47:03.709 --> 47:05.209
Oh, I see.

47:05.334 --> 47:06.876
What?

47:07.001 --> 47:08.709
I mean, Rio de Janeiro?

47:08.834 --> 47:11.792
No. In Brazil, we say, 'Hio de Janeiro'.

47:11.917 --> 47:13.584
I'm soh-hy.

47:13.709 --> 47:15.667
I'm Hong.

47:16.876 --> 47:18.834
So...

47:18.959 --> 47:20.917
you going to go?

47:21.042 --> 47:22.584
I'd love to.

47:24.542 --> 47:26.751
I don't know. It's a fantasy.

47:37.751 --> 47:39.751
What, who?

47:39.876 --> 47:42.001
Did you always want to go to Brazil?

47:42.126 --> 47:45.751
Well, they all seem really happy.

47:45.876 --> 47:47.542
They know how to have fun.

47:47.667 --> 47:49.167
Yeah, right.

47:49.292 --> 47:51.209
- Hey, funnyman!
- Incoming.

47:51.334 --> 47:53.459
- Can we swap chairs?
- Yeah.

47:55.376 --> 47:58.709
If he comes over,
we'll pretend we're having an argument,

47:58.834 --> 48:00.667
and he'll leave us alone.

48:00.792 --> 48:02.667
What did you just say?!

48:02.792 --> 48:05.292
- I was just...
- How dare you!

48:05.417 --> 48:08.834
I don't have to put up with this.
I'm leaving.

48:19.001 --> 48:22.042
Jesus! You don't hold back, do you?

48:22.167 --> 48:23.667
That really hurt!

48:23.792 --> 48:26.959
- Does it really hurt?
- Yeah. Ow!

48:36.542 --> 48:39.751
<i>She's thinking about going to Brazil.</i>

48:39.876 --> 48:42.126
And how do you feel about that?

48:42.251 --> 48:45.709
To be honest, there's always part of me
that feels relief.

48:45.834 --> 48:47.959
<i>Relieved of what?</i>

48:48.084 --> 48:50.584
The burden of having a girlfriend.

48:50.709 --> 48:53.417
<i>You've got to deal with their shit,</i>

48:53.542 --> 48:56.584
<i>you've got to listen to all the things
they have to say about you.</i>

48:56.709 --> 48:59.667
I mean, I don't need help hating myself.

49:01.417 --> 49:04.876
It's exhausting, being a boyfriend.

49:06.626 --> 49:08.126
But you know...

49:09.334 --> 49:11.126
I don't want her to go.

49:15.376 --> 49:16.876
So?

49:18.167 --> 49:20.876
How's it going with the new girlfriend?

49:21.001 --> 49:23.209
It's great.

49:23.334 --> 49:25.292
I just love talking to her.

49:30.292 --> 49:31.792
What?

49:31.917 --> 49:34.876
Your whole face changes
when you talk about her.

49:35.001 --> 49:37.001
Yeah, I know.

49:38.834 --> 49:41.417
I've got that sick feeling though.

49:41.542 --> 49:43.042
What do you mean?

49:45.001 --> 49:47.209
You know,
when something good is happening?

49:49.501 --> 49:52.209
What? Stop looking at me.

49:52.334 --> 49:54.084
Don't be like that.

50:00.917 --> 50:01.917
Hi.

50:03.417 --> 50:05.459
Do you like kids?

50:05.584 --> 50:07.417
Sort of.

50:07.542 --> 50:09.334
You ever think about having them?

50:09.459 --> 50:13.084
Jesus! Three dates,
we're having the kid conversation.

50:13.209 --> 50:14.959
No, I'm just curious.

50:15.084 --> 50:18.584
I'm not against them,
I mean, if the right person comes along.

50:18.709 --> 50:20.376
I don't really think about that much.

50:20.501 --> 50:24.042
Except their parents with their fucking
eyeballs bulging out of their heads,

50:24.167 --> 50:26.626
going, 'I haven't slept in two years!'

50:26.751 --> 50:28.417
- It's him!
- Uh-oh.

50:28.542 --> 50:30.959
- What?
- Incoming.

50:31.084 --> 50:33.667
- What do you want me to do?
- Dunno.

50:49.709 --> 50:52.251
Was that a real kiss or a fake kiss?

50:54.792 --> 50:56.292
This is a fake one.

50:59.959 --> 51:02.001
And this is a real one.

51:08.876 --> 51:10.667
What did that feel like?

51:11.709 --> 51:13.209
A real one.

51:13.334 --> 51:15.876
I wish those guys would come back.

51:18.001 --> 51:19.501
Let's go for a swim.

51:19.626 --> 51:21.542
- Serious?
- Yeah, let's do it.

51:21.667 --> 51:24.251
- No way!
- Come on, it'll be great.

51:24.376 --> 51:26.167
- We'll get wet!
- Yeah!

51:26.292 --> 51:28.584
- You go in.
- You don't think I will?

51:28.709 --> 51:30.584
Go on, then.

51:34.917 --> 51:36.417
What about now?

51:36.542 --> 51:38.584
- I'm still not going in.
- Come on!

51:38.709 --> 51:40.459
- I don't want to.
- Stop thinking!

51:40.584 --> 51:42.709
Come on, it'll be fun.
Don't be such a killjoy.

51:42.834 --> 51:44.542
I said, I don't want to!

51:51.542 --> 51:53.167
Anyway.

52:05.876 --> 52:07.417
Sorry for snapping.

52:07.542 --> 52:09.334
I just don't like water.

52:10.584 --> 52:12.084
Why don't you like water?

52:12.209 --> 52:13.709
I just don't.

52:17.959 --> 52:19.917
Can we just go home? So...

52:22.001 --> 52:23.834
I'm OK. I'm just going to get a cab.

52:23.959 --> 52:25.001
Yeah.

52:27.501 --> 52:29.001
Bye.

52:49.167 --> 52:53.376
<i>People who have one-night stands,
some people have judgement about...</i>

52:53.501 --> 52:57.792
<i>'That's disgusting,
sleeping with someone you don't know.'</i>

52:57.917 --> 52:59.709
<i>Don't you think it's just as disgusting</i>

52:59.834 --> 53:02.126
<i>to sleep with the same person
for 40 years?</i>

53:02.251 --> 53:04.667
<i>'Good morning. You again.'</i>

53:04.792 --> 53:09.709
<i>Performing live in a one-off special,
8pm Sunday night on Seven.</i>

53:16.292 --> 53:18.126
<i>Hello?</i>

53:18.251 --> 53:19.876
Caroline?

53:20.001 --> 53:21.501
<i>Thomas?</i>

53:22.709 --> 53:24.209
<i>How are you?</i>

53:24.334 --> 53:26.292
I've felt better.

53:27.667 --> 53:29.167
<i>Why, what's up?</i>

53:32.417 --> 53:33.959
<i>Do you really want to know this?</i>

53:34.084 --> 53:36.834
Yeah. What happened?

53:36.959 --> 53:41.751
<i>This girl I've been seeing,
we had a bit of a weird fight tonight.</i>

53:41.876 --> 53:45.459
<i>Basically, I didn't want
to do something, she kept pushing me,</i>

53:45.584 --> 53:47.084
<i>and I snapped.</i>

53:48.542 --> 53:50.417
What do you mean, pushing you?

53:52.251 --> 53:55.501
I said
I didn't want to swim in the harbour.

53:56.834 --> 54:00.209
And she just kept going, and...

54:01.209 --> 54:03.542
trying to make me do it,
and I didn't want to.

54:03.667 --> 54:07.334
Maybe she was trying to be romantic.

54:07.459 --> 54:11.001
<i>Yeah, that's what she said,
but I don't like to be pushed.</i>

54:11.126 --> 54:13.542
I've just always had this thing.

54:14.959 --> 54:17.459
I just hate getting wet.

54:17.584 --> 54:19.084
<i>Why?</i>

54:21.084 --> 54:22.584
Well...

54:22.709 --> 54:26.167
when I was a kid,
I remember having a bath...

54:27.667 --> 54:31.792
my old man coming in,
furious about something

54:31.917 --> 54:34.334
and holding my head underwater.

54:34.459 --> 54:37.251
I mean, I don't know what I done wrong.

54:38.501 --> 54:40.251
It's kind of funny though.

54:40.376 --> 54:43.876
<i>Crying and blowing a bubble
at the same time.</i>

54:44.001 --> 54:45.751
That's terrible, Manny.

54:45.876 --> 54:47.584
<i>Yeah, I know. It</i> was <i>terrible, but...</i>

54:50.501 --> 54:53.459
Sorry, what did you...

54:53.584 --> 54:55.501
<i>What did you just call me?</i>

54:58.251 --> 54:59.751
Hello?

55:16.376 --> 55:18.167
Did she call me 'Manny'?

55:20.251 --> 55:21.792
Did I say I was Manny?

55:27.542 --> 55:29.042
How would she know?

56:10.751 --> 56:12.251
<i>Hello?</i>

56:15.209 --> 56:17.501
Caroline? It's Thomas.

56:20.542 --> 56:22.417
<i>Is everything OK?</i>

56:23.876 --> 56:28.334
Well, I just found out something really
weird about the girl I've been seeing.

56:28.459 --> 56:29.959
<i>Mm. What's that?</i>

56:31.376 --> 56:33.626
I don't think she's being honest
with me.

56:33.751 --> 56:37.167
I just feel like
she's not who she says she is.

56:39.042 --> 56:42.792
<i>I guess we're all a bit like that
sometimes, aren't we, Thomas?</i>

56:42.917 --> 56:45.084
No. I'm honest.

56:46.084 --> 56:47.834
<i>I'm sure you are.</i>

56:47.959 --> 56:50.917
<i>Maybe she has reasons
for doing what she does.</i>

56:51.042 --> 56:54.167
Yeah? What reasons?

57:17.376 --> 57:20.334
<i>Yeah, so, meet the woman of your dreams?</i>

57:20.459 --> 57:23.167
<i>I don't want to meet
the woman of my dreams.</i>

57:23.292 --> 57:25.084
<i>I have nightmares.</i>

57:25.209 --> 57:27.167
<i>She's going to have three heads
and a tail,</i>

57:27.292 --> 57:30.417
<i>vomit coming out her eyeballs...
'Aaargh!'</i>

57:30.542 --> 57:33.334
<i>Actually, there's an easy way
to break up with someone.</i>

57:33.459 --> 57:38.751
<i>Next time you're making love to them,
just whisper in their ear, 'Mummy.</i>

57:38.876 --> 57:41.376
<i>You remind me of my mother.'</i>

57:43.542 --> 57:45.209
<i>That'll do the job.</i>

57:45.334 --> 57:49.042
<i>If she stays after that,
then you're in trouble.</i>

58:11.584 --> 58:14.167
When I was a kid, I was having a bath.

58:15.167 --> 58:19.459
I must have done something wrong,
'cause Dad came in all pissed off

58:19.584 --> 58:21.834
and held my head underwater.

58:21.959 --> 58:26.084
I don't know if he was punishing me
or teaching me to swim.

58:36.376 --> 58:38.834
Before he used to belt me,
he used to say, 'Hey, son!'

58:40.626 --> 58:42.126
I'd say, 'Yeah?'

58:44.376 --> 58:46.917
'This is going to hurt me
more than it hurts you.'

58:47.042 --> 58:49.292
I used to think, 'Yeah?

58:49.417 --> 58:52.084
Not unless you miss and hit the chair.'

58:59.626 --> 59:03.501
Before he used to hit me,
he used to test my eyesight.

59:03.626 --> 59:05.251
'See that, son?'

59:06.542 --> 59:08.376
'Yeah, I see it.'

59:08.501 --> 59:10.334
Ah, fuck!

59:26.917 --> 59:29.292
<i>Hi, Manny. It's me.</i>

59:29.417 --> 59:32.001
<i>Would you please call me? I just...</i>

59:33.334 --> 59:34.959
<i>I just want to talk.</i>

01:01:24.459 --> 01:01:27.001
I had to go all over the place

I'll give you a good belting!

01:01:32.042 --> 01:01:33.542
Hey!

01:01:37.501 --> 01:01:39.667
What are you doing?

01:01:39.792 --> 01:01:41.459
What?

01:01:41.584 --> 01:01:44.042
What do you have a dog for,
if you treat it like shit?

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:46.876
It licks my feet, Manny, not yours.

01:01:47.001 --> 01:01:50.292
- Don't beat the dog up, you cockhead.
- Wanker!

01:01:50.417 --> 01:01:53.292
Doesn't matter. Don't beat your dog up.
What's wrong with you?

01:01:53.417 --> 01:01:56.959
- Just stick to your jokes, Manny.
- Don't push me, you dickhead.

01:01:57.084 --> 01:01:59.126
What?

01:01:59.251 --> 01:02:01.542
Why don't you try me?

01:02:03.167 --> 01:02:05.959
It's my dog! Get your fucking own dog.

01:02:08.251 --> 01:02:11.042
Why don't <i>you</i> feed the fucking thing?

01:02:14.584 --> 01:02:16.459
Oi!

01:02:16.584 --> 01:02:18.417
Coppers!

01:02:18.542 --> 01:02:21.334
- The cop shop's right there.
- Yeah, well...

01:02:21.459 --> 01:02:23.501
- What's going on?
- He punched me in the face.

01:02:23.626 --> 01:02:24.876
No, I didn't.

01:02:26.501 --> 01:02:28.001
Let's go.

01:02:52.792 --> 01:02:54.292
So...

01:02:55.376 --> 01:02:57.751
what was going on last night?

01:02:57.876 --> 01:03:01.001
It's all over the internet, mate.
It's in the papers.

01:03:01.126 --> 01:03:03.167
So what?

01:03:03.292 --> 01:03:04.792
People get pissed.

01:03:09.667 --> 01:03:13.417
You know
they've all got those camera phones now.

01:03:13.542 --> 01:03:15.334
- Everyone's seen it.
- Who cares?

01:03:15.459 --> 01:03:16.959
Manny, I care.

01:03:18.417 --> 01:03:21.834
And the Americans that I just picked up
from the airport, they care.

01:03:21.959 --> 01:03:26.876
And the network that's forking out
a shitload of money for your show care.

01:03:27.001 --> 01:03:30.417
As long as I do a funny show,
what's the problem?

01:03:30.542 --> 01:03:32.709
OK, I'll tell you the problem.

01:03:32.834 --> 01:03:35.959
It's not just about the show, Manny.

01:03:36.084 --> 01:03:38.001
I've been on the phone to them
for an hour

01:03:38.126 --> 01:03:41.626
trying to convince them that
you're not a total disaster.

01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:44.542
I'm sorry
you have to work for your money.

01:03:44.667 --> 01:03:49.292
What do you want for 20%?
To shake people's hands,

01:03:49.417 --> 01:03:53.626
take your family out for a good time
on the weekend, huh?

01:03:54.834 --> 01:03:58.459
Alright, mate,
you're a bit out of control.

01:03:58.584 --> 01:04:03.376
All I'm saying is, just try not
to ruin everything while they're here.

01:04:03.501 --> 01:04:05.209
Just stay off the piss.

01:04:08.709 --> 01:04:10.334
That's rich, coming from you.

01:04:11.542 --> 01:04:14.584
At least I'm not drunk
in front of my kid.

01:04:19.209 --> 01:04:21.501
I think I might just walk home.

01:04:21.626 --> 01:04:23.126
Yeah, good idea.

01:05:04.709 --> 01:05:06.459
Hello?

01:05:06.584 --> 01:05:08.084
How are you?

01:05:09.709 --> 01:05:11.209
Are you home?

01:05:12.584 --> 01:05:14.376
Can I come over for a bit?

01:05:16.001 --> 01:05:17.501
Righto.

01:05:17.626 --> 01:05:19.126
See ya.

01:05:39.251 --> 01:05:41.459
What happened to your hand?

01:05:45.459 --> 01:05:46.959
I punched a mirror.

01:05:49.042 --> 01:05:51.459
Why'd you punch a mirror for?

01:05:51.584 --> 01:05:53.084
Pissed off.

01:05:55.459 --> 01:05:56.959
What with?

01:05:58.959 --> 01:06:01.917
What did you think of me
when I was a kid?

01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:05.126
Well, you were a good kid.

01:06:06.834 --> 01:06:09.334
You were a funny little bastard.

01:06:09.459 --> 01:06:12.584
You used to make me and your mother
laugh.

01:06:17.001 --> 01:06:19.376
Why do you want to know that for?

01:06:20.792 --> 01:06:23.751
You know I was terrified of you
as a kid?

01:06:23.876 --> 01:06:25.376
Were you?

01:06:26.417 --> 01:06:27.917
Why?

01:06:29.792 --> 01:06:31.292
You used to hit me.

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:39.751
I ain't been thinking about that lately.

01:06:45.042 --> 01:06:46.542
Life's been shit.

01:06:47.876 --> 01:06:52.334
I've been thinking about
when I was young, for some reason.

01:07:03.876 --> 01:07:06.917
Well, I apologise for hitting you, mate.

01:07:46.209 --> 01:07:47.251
Alright...

01:07:50.876 --> 01:07:52.376
Bye.

01:07:56.376 --> 01:07:57.876
Bye, friend.

01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:10.126
Where's your girlfriend?

01:08:12.417 --> 01:08:14.209
Too hard, Pieter.

01:08:14.334 --> 01:08:16.376
What too hard... girl?

01:08:16.501 --> 01:08:18.001
Yeah.

01:08:23.042 --> 01:08:24.542
Hey, Pieter?

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:26.167
Yeah?

01:08:26.292 --> 01:08:28.917
Why do you always give me a beer
when I don't even order one?

01:08:29.042 --> 01:08:31.209
I know you. I know your brain.

01:08:31.334 --> 01:08:34.334
You think, think, think, never decide.

01:08:34.459 --> 01:08:36.417
I give you beer, you drink.

01:08:36.542 --> 01:08:39.501
Have beer, have woman.

01:08:39.626 --> 01:08:41.501
Don't think.

01:09:07.334 --> 01:09:11.251
<i>The number you have dialled
has been disconnected.</i>

01:09:23.501 --> 01:09:25.292
<i>Hello, Fantasy Hotline.</i>

01:09:25.417 --> 01:09:31.001
Ah, hi. I was
hoping to speak to Caroline, PIN 713?

01:09:31.126 --> 01:09:34.167
<i>PIN 713 is no longer with us,
I'm afraid,</i>

01:09:34.292 --> 01:09:36.501
<i>but I can put you through
to another lovely lady.</i>

01:09:36.626 --> 01:09:40.084
Oh. Well, where'd she go?

01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:42.376
<i>I'm sorry, I can't say.
But I can put you through</i>

01:09:42.501 --> 01:09:46.042
<i>to another one of our gorgeous girls,
if you'd like to chat with one of them.</i>

01:09:46.167 --> 01:09:47.876
No, that's OK. Thanks.

01:10:03.001 --> 01:10:04.501
Maria!

01:10:06.334 --> 01:10:07.834
Maria!

01:10:09.917 --> 01:10:11.751
Manny?

01:10:11.876 --> 01:10:14.167
She's gone, Manny.

01:10:15.376 --> 01:10:17.501
Do you know where she's going?

01:10:17.626 --> 01:10:21.417
Man, she's going on the boat
to South America.

01:10:21.542 --> 01:10:23.042
South America?

01:10:24.292 --> 01:10:26.292
You didn't know?

01:10:26.417 --> 01:10:28.251
No.

01:10:28.376 --> 01:10:30.501
They sail tonight.

01:10:30.626 --> 01:10:32.626
I'm sorry.

01:10:33.917 --> 01:10:37.292
Oh, Manny,
she wanted me to give you something.

01:10:43.709 --> 01:10:46.167
Thanks, mate.

01:10:46.292 --> 01:10:49.834
Hey, Manny...
good luck for the show tonight.

01:10:49.959 --> 01:10:51.667
Thanks, mate. Cheers.

01:11:33.167 --> 01:11:36.876
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please make your way into the theatre.</i>

01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:40.042
<i>Manny Lewis Live will commence shortly.</i>

01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:55.626
G'day, mate.

01:11:55.751 --> 01:11:59.417
Ah, Joel, this is Manny.
Manny, this is Joel.

01:11:59.542 --> 01:12:03.167
- How are you going, Joel?
- I hear you're a funny guy.

01:12:03.292 --> 01:12:05.626
That's a great crowd you've got
out there.

01:12:05.751 --> 01:12:07.251
Yeah, they're alright.

01:12:08.626 --> 01:12:11.042
- Congratulations.
- Well...

01:12:11.167 --> 01:12:14.334
if it wasn't for this bloke,
I wouldn't have anything.

01:12:14.459 --> 01:12:18.251
I'd still be working on a building site.
So...

01:12:18.376 --> 01:12:19.876
thanks, mate.

01:12:24.751 --> 01:12:27.459
Well, as they say in the business...

01:12:29.209 --> 01:12:32.167
chookers. We'll talk later.

01:12:32.292 --> 01:12:34.751
OK! Nice to meet you.

01:12:34.876 --> 01:12:36.917
- Got everything?
- Yeah, mate, I'm alright.

01:12:37.042 --> 01:12:38.542
- OK.
- Hey, ah...

01:12:40.126 --> 01:12:41.751
is the old man in?

01:12:41.876 --> 01:12:43.501
No. Sorry, mate.

01:12:53.584 --> 01:12:56.042
<i>Two minutes, Mr Lewis.</i>

01:12:56.167 --> 01:12:57.667
Yeah, righto.

01:13:01.209 --> 01:13:03.751
Right. Let's go be funny.

01:13:15.001 --> 01:13:16.834
<i>Live across Australia,</i>

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:19.917
<i>please welcome our very own funnyman,
Manny Lewis.</i>

01:13:32.251 --> 01:13:33.751
So, where were we?

01:13:35.501 --> 01:13:37.167
Nice to be here. I was just over there,

01:13:37.292 --> 01:13:40.001
and it wasn't very nice over there.
It's better over here.

01:13:40.126 --> 01:13:42.459
I hope you laugh tonight.

01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:44.084
I hope you laugh a lot.

01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:47.126
Actually,
I hope a little bit of wee comes out.

01:13:47.251 --> 01:13:48.959
That's a good night.

01:13:49.084 --> 01:13:55.042
You go home... 'How was the show?'
'Look at my pants! Great show.'

01:13:55.167 --> 01:13:58.334
I love performing. I've always
performed, ever since I was a kid.

01:13:58.459 --> 01:14:02.751
I had no choice. My parents used to
get drunk and dress me up.

01:14:02.876 --> 01:14:05.542
We used to have these African nights.

01:14:05.667 --> 01:14:07.584
Mum would take all my clothes off,

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:11.292
get a lettuce leaf and a bit of string
and wrap it around here.

01:14:11.417 --> 01:14:14.126
'Do the dance.' 'Righto.'

01:14:16.292 --> 01:14:18.376
But I don't like watching performers.

01:14:18.501 --> 01:14:21.292
I went and saw a country singer
the other day, and they shit me.

01:14:21.417 --> 01:14:23.042
Before every song, he'd say,

01:14:23.167 --> 01:14:27.042
'It's a beautiful song, and
it goes a little something like this.'

01:14:27.167 --> 01:14:31.542
I feel like saying, 'Mate,
just play it exactly the way it goes.

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:34.834
How long have you been playing
that song, and you haven't nailed it?

01:14:34.959 --> 01:14:38.834
You should say, "It's a beautiful song,
and it goes exactly like this."'

01:14:42.376 --> 01:14:47.584
I don't know what 'wrong' is.
It's a funny thing, wrong.

01:14:47.709 --> 01:14:50.251
What's wrong?

01:14:50.376 --> 01:14:53.834
Washing your tea towels
with your underwear?

01:14:56.834 --> 01:15:00.417
I mean, it all gets in the mix.
The soap powder washes it out,

01:15:00.542 --> 01:15:03.209
but it just feels like
I'm drying the dishes with my bum.

01:15:06.834 --> 01:15:08.709
Yeah, but anyway.

01:15:08.834 --> 01:15:10.459
My dad was very precise, you know?

01:15:10.584 --> 01:15:15.251
He said, 'Listen, son,
don't use this in life, use this,'

01:15:15.376 --> 01:15:18.209
which I took to mean,
don't hit people, headbutt them.

01:15:25.584 --> 01:15:28.126
<i>When I was a kid,
walking into the lounge...</i>

01:15:28.251 --> 01:15:32.084
- You alright there?
- Yeah. Go ahead, I'll catch up.

01:15:32.209 --> 01:15:34.334
<i>I was eight.</i>

01:15:37.334 --> 01:15:41.084
<i>When I was a kid,
I was having a bath once.</i>

01:15:45.751 --> 01:15:48.459
I must have done something wrong...

01:15:50.209 --> 01:15:51.709
'cause Dad...

01:15:54.376 --> 01:15:55.876
Dad came in...

01:16:08.542 --> 01:16:11.126
Come on, son. Spit it out!

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:23.876
People always ask me about the stuff
I do about Dad.

01:16:24.001 --> 01:16:27.417
They say,
'Your father sounds like a hard man.'

01:16:27.542 --> 01:16:30.626
He's probably not as hard as
I make out he is.

01:16:30.751 --> 01:16:32.251
I do love him.

01:16:33.626 --> 01:16:36.501
I probably should leave him alone
for awhile.

01:16:37.667 --> 01:16:39.167
How am I doing, Dad?

01:16:42.001 --> 01:16:43.501
Proud of you, son.

01:16:49.167 --> 01:16:51.167
I'm proud of him.

01:16:51.292 --> 01:16:54.542
Except for the time that
he shit his pants.

01:16:55.751 --> 01:16:57.292
He's making that up.

01:16:59.834 --> 01:17:02.626
I threatened to tell Mum for years...

01:17:05.542 --> 01:17:07.667
but she was doing the same.

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:13.751
I'd like to sing a song now,
dedicated to a girl.

01:17:13.876 --> 01:17:15.917
It goes exactly like this.

01:17:21.459 --> 01:17:23.001
<i>♪ Met her downstairs</i>

01:17:26.001 --> 01:17:28.792
<i>♪ In the cafe underneath her flat</i>

01:17:37.042 --> 01:17:38.751
<i>♪ She was reading a book</i>

01:17:40.584 --> 01:17:43.917
<i>♪ About some old guy
about to top himself</i>

01:17:49.001 --> 01:17:50.959
<i>♪ She looked kind of lonely</i>

01:17:54.792 --> 01:17:56.751
<i>♪ She looked kind of sad</i>

01:18:01.667 --> 01:18:03.376
<i>♪ The reason that I knew</i>

01:18:07.334 --> 01:18:10.084
<i>♪ These were feelings that I had</i>

01:18:18.876 --> 01:18:20.376
<i>♪ To make her happy</i>

01:18:23.251 --> 01:18:25.667
<i>♪ Is all I wanted to do</i>

01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:35.167
<i>♪ We went out dancing</i>

01:18:35.292 --> 01:18:37.334

01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:52.084
<i>♪ The more that we forgot</i>

01:18:56.584 --> 01:18:58.376

<i>♪ Underneath her flat. ♪</i>

01:19:33.542 --> 01:19:35.042
Thank you.

01:19:45.459 --> 01:19:50.084
Here's to a fantastic performance
and a brilliant career.

01:19:50.209 --> 01:19:54.251
I'm going to make your son a star
in America.

01:19:54.376 --> 01:19:56.042
He's already a star.

01:19:56.167 --> 01:19:58.584
- He certainly is, sir.
- I know.

01:19:58.709 --> 01:20:00.751
OK.

01:20:03.084 --> 01:20:04.584
Sa'ude!

01:20:06.751 --> 01:20:08.251
Brazil!

01:20:08.376 --> 01:20:10.417
Brazil, Maria!

01:20:10.542 --> 01:20:14.709
We're all very happy.
It's going to be a great adventure.

01:20:14.834 --> 01:20:18.001
This is for you to sign.

01:20:18.126 --> 01:20:19.626
Thanks, mate.

01:20:27.584 --> 01:20:32.042
It's, ah, it's everything
we agreed upon, mate. It's fine.

01:20:38.917 --> 01:20:40.417
You cool?

01:20:41.709 --> 01:20:43.417
Yeah.

01:20:48.459 --> 01:20:50.542
Just give me a minute, mate.

01:20:53.876 --> 01:20:55.876
I'll just go have a word.

01:20:56.001 --> 01:20:57.501
Let me, Jimmy.

01:21:00.542 --> 01:21:02.042
We got a problem?

01:21:03.042 --> 01:21:05.917
No, Joel.
I think it's just a bit of cold feet.

01:21:06.042 --> 01:21:07.542
Maria!

01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:38.417
I don't feel good, Dad.

01:21:41.459 --> 01:21:42.959
Listen, son...

01:21:44.792 --> 01:21:47.376
I never did much right in my life.

01:21:48.792 --> 01:21:51.542
Could have been a better father...

01:21:51.667 --> 01:21:53.167
better husband.

01:21:53.292 --> 01:21:55.709
But one thing I can be proud of...

01:21:57.792 --> 01:22:00.834
the day I told your mother I loved her.

01:22:02.001 --> 01:22:03.876
I was scared!

01:22:04.001 --> 01:22:06.084
I thought she'd laugh at me.

01:22:07.584 --> 01:22:09.959
It was the best thing I ever did.

01:22:10.084 --> 01:22:12.626
It gave me everything I have.

01:22:14.876 --> 01:22:16.417
All I'm saying is...

01:22:18.751 --> 01:22:20.542
don't be afraid, son.

01:22:21.917 --> 01:22:23.417
Don't be afraid.

01:22:27.417 --> 01:22:28.917
Thanks, Dad.

01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:59.084
Is everything alright, Jimmy?

01:22:59.209 --> 01:23:01.667
Oh, everything's fine, Joel.

01:23:01.792 --> 01:23:03.417
Let me buy you a drink.
