<i>Black Manta
to Deathstroke.</i>

00:25.394 --> 00:27.128
<i>Awaiting progress report.</i>

00:27.195 --> 00:29.130
Progress is slow.

00:29.198 --> 00:32.299
<i>Miss Martian has partially
restored your son's psyche,</i>

00:32.368 --> 00:35.503
<i>but he remains
far from whole.</i>

00:35.571 --> 00:39.374
All right. Keep the manta flyer
at a safe distance from the sub,

00:39.442 --> 00:42.544
beyond the range
of Miss Martian's psychic power.

00:52.054 --> 00:56.757
He's still not himself.
<i>But then, who is?</i>

00:58.017 --> 00:59.941
<i>So what's our next move?</i>

01:00.034 --> 01:02.731
<i>With that inhibitor collar
disabling your shape shifting</i>

01:02.764 --> 01:06.018
<i>and telekinetic abilities,
I'm not sure.</i>

01:06.835 --> 01:09.236
<i>I guess we're lucky Deathstroke
hasn't pressed a button</i>

01:09.264 --> 01:11.172
<i>to block my psychic powers, too.</i>

01:11.332 --> 01:13.622
<i>Or pressed another button
to blow your head off,</i>

01:13.654 --> 01:15.966
<i>with the explosives
built into the collar.</i>

01:15.989 --> 01:17.405
<i>It hardly matters.</i>

01:17.427 --> 01:20.691
<i>You know Manta plans to kill me
as soon as I've cured his son.</i>

01:20.750 --> 01:24.087
<i>Which is why he must not
learn I am already cured</i>

01:24.154 --> 01:27.524
<i>until we devise some way
to save M'gann's life.</i>

01:27.592 --> 01:31.914
<i>Yeah, but the question is,
how long can we continue to stall?</i>

01:33.669 --> 01:37.872
My patience has run out, Martian.
You have 24 hours.

01:38.135 --> 01:41.605
<i>Finish curing my son,
or die.</i>

01:44.775 --> 01:49.312
<i>Guess that answers your question.
I'm doomed either way.</i>

<b>Season 2: Invasion</b>
Episode 16: "Complications"

Sync & corrections: Reef
www.addic7ed.com

02:10.836 --> 02:12.535
All right, what happened?

02:12.603 --> 02:14.837
What happened to
the rest of my Team?

02:14.905 --> 02:18.174
- It's all my fault.
- That assessment is inaccurate.

02:18.242 --> 02:21.243
Just tell him
what you told us.

02:22.946 --> 02:24.214
We'd won.

02:24.247 --> 02:28.017
We were all here in this bay, and
Wondergirl had Mongul hogtied.

02:28.085 --> 02:31.320
Then suddenly a boomtube opened up
right beneath our feet.

02:31.388 --> 02:33.656
<i>I flew up and out.
It was instinct, you know.</i>

02:33.724 --> 02:35.491
But before I could do
anything else,

02:35.559 --> 02:39.209
the boomtube closed,
and the others were gone.

02:39.248 --> 02:41.966
Definitely reading
traces of boomtube activity.

02:42.033 --> 02:45.369
We think Mongul may have opened
the boomtube as a mean of escape,

02:45.437 --> 02:47.805
gaining the Team as captives
in the bargain.

02:48.035 --> 02:51.634
- The Team and worse.
- Impulse had the crystal key.

02:51.658 --> 02:55.913
So the priority is making sure no one
uses it to reactivate the Warworld.

02:55.981 --> 02:58.982
Captain Marvel and Rocket are
already guarding the key chamber.

02:59.050 --> 03:01.620
And the Justice League will
continue guarding it in shifts

03:01.651 --> 03:04.621
until the key is found
and the threat is ended.

03:04.689 --> 03:07.758
- It's all my fault.
- Stop.

03:07.826 --> 03:11.161
You didn't do anything wrong.
We'll figure this out.

03:11.229 --> 03:14.030
- For now...
- I will ensure he gets home safely.

03:14.098 --> 03:16.500
No, I want to stay.
I want to help.

03:16.567 --> 03:20.033
You will help.
But right now, you need rest.

03:20.079 --> 03:22.695
Sleep. Go.

03:25.776 --> 03:31.581
- I'm sorry.
- No. Whoever did this, they'll be sorry.

04:50.764 --> 04:53.065
I want to make
one thing clear.

04:54.034 --> 04:57.203
I'm only working with you
to avenge my sister.

04:57.271 --> 05:01.060
Yeah, 'cause you and Artemis
were always so close.

05:01.099 --> 05:03.514
<i>Rationalize it however
you want, little girl,</i>

05:03.545 --> 05:07.355
just handle Aqualad
and leave Black Manta to me.

05:07.382 --> 05:10.351
I need to put him down
to preserve my rep.

05:10.418 --> 05:14.755
- And that's all you care about.
- Don't kid yourself, Jade.

05:14.822 --> 05:16.957
We're not that different.

06:04.102 --> 06:06.955
<i>- So we're all agreed?
- No, we're not.</i>

06:06.986 --> 06:09.649
<i>I don't want the two of you
risking exposure for me.</i>

06:09.674 --> 06:12.232
<i>Instead you expect us
to sit back and let you die?</i>

06:12.264 --> 06:14.612
<i>No.
Artemis, begin.</i>

06:14.679 --> 06:17.285
<i>Deathstroke, been on duty
for 12 hours straight.</i>

06:17.316 --> 06:19.950
<i>I need to stretch my legs,
and I need coffee.</i>

06:20.344 --> 06:21.956
Understood.

06:22.729 --> 06:25.106
Take over.
I'll be back in five.

06:30.596 --> 06:33.165
- Fresh pot.
- No thanks.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.869
<i>- This should not take long.
- No, assuming she isn't caught.</i>

06:44.676 --> 06:46.911
This is for Artemis.

06:51.560 --> 06:52.760
No!

06:54.771 --> 06:57.819
You protect the man
who murdered your best friend?

06:57.857 --> 07:01.191
<i>Cheshire, stop.
You don't understand.</i>

07:01.251 --> 07:05.120
- No, not now.
- What? What don't I understand?

07:05.164 --> 07:07.720
Deathstroke to Manta.
You have an intruder aboard.

07:07.744 --> 07:09.841
Cheshire's in
your son's cabin.

07:10.734 --> 07:13.042
Manta's Communications.
Intruder alert.

07:13.086 --> 07:15.630
<i>Reinforcements
to my son's room, now!</i>

07:30.185 --> 07:33.427
<i>M'gann, what's going on?
M'gann?</i>

07:33.822 --> 07:37.362
I'll coordinate from here.
You two protect Kaldur'ahm.

08:40.345 --> 08:42.947
<i>Looks like someone
already got to Aqualad.</i>

08:43.014 --> 08:45.615
<i>In fact, it looks like
that someone was you.</i>

08:45.683 --> 08:48.318
Which makes you defending him
even more inexplicable

08:48.385 --> 08:51.732
and me killing him a lot
less amusing.

08:51.772 --> 08:55.875
But then again, I'm not here
for the giggles.

09:09.041 --> 09:14.279
<i>Inhibitor collar.
So no Martian powers. Pity.</i>

09:14.346 --> 09:16.214
Deathstroke to Tigress.

09:16.239 --> 09:19.517
<i>The assassin Cheshire has locked
herself inside Kaldur'ahm's cabin.</i>

09:19.584 --> 09:21.819
<i>The Martian's attempting
to save him.</i>

09:21.886 --> 09:25.088
<i>She knows if her patient dies,
we have no reason to keep her alive.</i>

09:25.156 --> 09:26.590
<i>But you better
get back there now.</i>

09:26.657 --> 09:28.344
On my way.

09:40.705 --> 09:44.175
OK, now we can talk.

09:44.243 --> 09:45.643
Cheshire, stop.

09:45.711 --> 09:48.279
All is not what it seems.

09:48.680 --> 09:52.065
So it would appear, "Mr. Fake some
mental condition". That's fine.

09:52.118 --> 09:55.687
Killing you will be
so much more satisfying now.

09:55.755 --> 09:58.638
Wait. You seek my death
because of your sister.

09:58.686 --> 10:00.388
But Artemis is alive.

10:00.435 --> 10:02.828
In fact, she is
aboard this vessel.

10:02.896 --> 10:05.854
Artemis is alive?

10:06.833 --> 10:10.737
You didn't really think
I'd buy that, did you?

10:46.222 --> 10:48.390
Airlock's damaged.

10:52.982 --> 10:55.484
Robin's <i>birdarang</i>.

11:07.297 --> 11:10.739
Birdarang must have
scratched Blue's armor.

11:15.950 --> 11:17.317
Finally!

11:22.579 --> 11:25.315
You betrayed your friends,
murdered my sister.

11:25.361 --> 11:30.688
Perhaps when I cut you open,
I'll find you truly are heartless.

11:30.755 --> 11:35.025
M'gann, the collar's deactivated.
You should have all your powers back.

11:35.093 --> 11:37.570
M'gann? M'gann!

11:51.021 --> 11:53.744
- Tigress! To my side!
- Yes, boss!

11:58.071 --> 12:02.754
- Take him! I'm saving my son!
- You won't get away that easy, Manta!

12:12.032 --> 12:15.534
You're playing for
the wrong team, girly-girl.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.970
Game over.

12:27.732 --> 12:30.166
Sir, we have an explosive
charge ready to detonate...

12:36.173 --> 12:38.008
Kaldur'ahm!

12:47.953 --> 12:53.447
Father and son.
My lucky day.

12:58.330 --> 13:00.264
<i>Enough!</i>

13:34.833 --> 13:36.467
How dare you...!

13:36.501 --> 13:40.345
What gives you the right to invade my mind
and steal this memory from our childhood?

13:40.353 --> 13:44.056
This isn't your memory, Jade.
It's mine.

13:51.618 --> 13:55.287
I'm alive.
I'm here.

13:55.355 --> 13:56.755
Look.

14:02.666 --> 14:05.660
<i>Aqualad did not kill Artemis.</i>

14:08.035 --> 14:11.872
<i>She only pretended to be dead,
so she could become Tigress</i>

14:11.939 --> 14:17.244
<i>and join Aqualad's deep cover mission
to infiltrate The Light and The Reach.</i>

14:20.515 --> 14:24.718
- You're alive.
- I'm alive.

14:24.786 --> 14:27.154
So you don't need to take
vengeance on Kaldur.

14:27.222 --> 14:31.392
I guess I don't.
You so dodged a bullet, <i>fish boy</i>.

14:31.459 --> 14:34.857
- We appreciate the cooperation.
- Are you serious?

14:34.896 --> 14:38.699
You're not really buying this.
It's some kind of Martian illusion.

14:38.767 --> 14:43.337
Artemis is still dead,
and I still have my rep to preserve.

14:43.405 --> 14:47.430
Come on, crusher.
Artemis is your daughter.

14:47.454 --> 14:52.146
- Can't you feel her presence here?
- I don't even <i>feel</i> your presence here.

14:52.214 --> 14:56.061
He's hopeless, and I don't know
why I'm surprised.

14:56.319 --> 15:01.347
- Release us. I'll convince him.
- Yeah. Good luck with that.

15:12.469 --> 15:17.248
- I taught you that move!
- Uh, duh, dad.

15:17.287 --> 15:21.429
So you and Aqualad <i>are</i> playing
Manta and The Light for chumps.

15:21.478 --> 15:24.948
Ha! I can live with that,
baby girl.

15:27.685 --> 15:30.187
Good.
Because I need a favor.

15:44.315 --> 15:47.275
<i>I realize, Cheshire,
that we'll probably never be friends.</i>

15:47.304 --> 15:49.138
<i>You can leave out
the "probably."</i>

15:49.206 --> 15:51.707
<i>But we both want
to keep your sister safe.</i>

15:51.774 --> 15:54.810
<i>So we play it out.
You start.</i>

15:54.877 --> 15:58.814
Well, Cheshire, I don't usually
condone the behavior of assassins,

15:58.882 --> 16:01.884
but given the way Manta's
treated me the last few weeks...

16:01.952 --> 16:04.386
The enemy of your enemy
is your friend.

16:04.454 --> 16:06.823
Exactly.

16:06.890 --> 16:09.025
Make your escape.
I'll buy all the time you need.

16:09.092 --> 16:13.896
It's not that simple.
I still want Aqualad and Manta dead.

16:13.940 --> 16:17.809
- Leave that to me.
- I insist.

16:24.040 --> 16:27.410
So, who's first,
you or your degenerate son?

16:33.083 --> 16:34.350
Kaldur'ahm!

16:34.418 --> 16:40.456
- Father, are you all right?
- Fine. Just fine, now.

16:59.815 --> 17:03.146
Yeah. "So glad it turned out
you're not dead, baby girl."

17:08.484 --> 17:10.185
Favor done, baby girl.

17:10.253 --> 17:13.423
Now, no one will know
what you've been up to.

17:17.694 --> 17:22.065
Well, that was a nice father-daughter
outing. We should do this more often.

17:22.133 --> 17:25.128
- Don't push it, dad.
- Leaving so soon?

17:28.373 --> 17:32.197
- And without a good-bye?
- Good-bye.

17:52.798 --> 17:54.398
I've got Cheshire!

17:59.789 --> 18:01.506
You're a chump, Slade.

18:01.574 --> 18:04.109
The Light betrayed me.
They'll betray you, too.

18:04.177 --> 18:07.045
Not if I take
a seat at their table.

18:09.215 --> 18:13.118
Love the new look, sis.
Reminds me of me.

18:13.186 --> 18:15.820
So I know dad was only here
to protect his rep,

18:15.888 --> 18:18.656
but you risked everything
to avenge me.

18:18.724 --> 18:21.945
- That's so sweet.
- Let's not get teary-eyed.

18:21.994 --> 18:25.096
I was just mad you weren't
around to baby-sit your niece.

18:30.369 --> 18:32.370
Stop toying with her
and finish it!

18:36.754 --> 18:39.084
<i>- M'gann!
- Incoming!</i>

18:46.652 --> 18:49.320
- I'll finish him.
- Sorry, no.

18:49.388 --> 18:52.123
I've been dreaming
of my revenge for weeks.

18:52.191 --> 18:54.258
<i>Don't push your luck, Sporty.</i>

18:54.326 --> 18:58.730
- You're lucky I'm letting you get away.
- Fine. We're gone.

19:04.069 --> 19:08.072
Now, let's see what fun
I can have with you two.

19:08.140 --> 19:11.275
Yes, let's.

19:16.748 --> 19:19.182
<i>M'gann, get out
before he captures you again!</i>

19:19.250 --> 19:22.085
<i>- Right, right! And sorry.
- About what?</i>

19:47.871 --> 19:52.951
- Thanks again for watching Lian.
- My pleasure.

19:53.887 --> 19:57.918
You should cherish this time
with your daughter, Jade.

19:57.996 --> 20:00.077
You never know.

20:01.026 --> 20:05.530
Mom, I've got something
to tell you about Artemis.

20:05.597 --> 20:08.157
Some good news.

20:09.463 --> 20:12.223
<i>It is the best of news.</i>

20:13.008 --> 20:16.067
My son is whole again.

20:16.331 --> 20:21.168
Seeing me in mortal danger was
the vital catalyst his recovery required.

20:21.214 --> 20:23.615
I truly feel blessed.

20:23.683 --> 20:25.484
<i>Congratulations.</i>

20:25.552 --> 20:29.722
<i>In fact, it has been a good day
for us all.</i>

20:33.060 --> 20:37.098
<i>And in my role as The Reach's
ambassador to your world,</i>

20:37.144 --> 20:41.601
<i>I want to take this opportunity
to thank this great hero,</i>

20:41.669 --> 20:46.739
<i>a hero who almost single-handedly saved
the planet Earth from the Warworld.</i>

20:46.807 --> 20:50.830
<i>He saved your lives.
He saved our lives.</i>

20:50.862 --> 20:54.281
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you...</i>

20:54.348 --> 20:57.250
<i>Blue Beetle!</i>

20:59.115 --> 21:01.822
<i>Thank you.
Thank you all.</i>

21:01.890 --> 21:05.126
<i>But it is I who should express
gratitude to you, Ambassador,</i>

21:05.166 --> 21:08.166
<i>for giving a normal,
average human being like me</i>

21:08.205 --> 21:12.534
<i>the power of The Reach,
the power to save the world.</i>
