Immigrated to New York

Says on his lease he's
a "freelance I.T. consultant."

02:07.170 --> 02:09.433
Looks like whoever
killed him

02:09.477 --> 02:12.349
hit him from behind
with a blunt object,

02:12.393 --> 02:14.917
tied his wrists
with zip ties,

02:14.960 --> 02:17.006
then went to work
with that knife.

02:17.049 --> 02:18.747
When they were done,
they slashed his throat.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.488
The knife is from
Ando's kitchen.

02:20.531 --> 02:23.665
He was probably hit with
that bronze Buddha.

02:23.708 --> 02:25.319
What about the zip ties?

02:25.362 --> 02:27.016
Right, well, those I'm guessing
the killer brought,

02:27.059 --> 02:28.452
but it's hard to know for sure.

02:28.496 --> 02:30.019
The fire really tore
through this place,

02:30.062 --> 02:31.673
which was probably
the point.

02:31.716 --> 02:35.155
Killer didn't want to
leave any evidence behind.

02:35.198 --> 02:36.330
Still, I think I know

02:36.373 --> 02:37.679
what this was about.

02:37.722 --> 02:39.159
Look at his left hand.

02:43.598 --> 02:46.253
He's missing the mid and distal
bones of his pinky finger.

02:46.296 --> 02:48.385
BELL:
At first, I thought the killer

02:48.429 --> 02:49.952
did it before
he set the fire,

02:49.995 --> 02:51.562
but there's no exposed bone.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.173
So it healed a
long time ago.

02:53.216 --> 02:58.395
So, Japanese man
plus severed pinky plus...

03:02.138 --> 03:06.229
...full body tattoos
usually equals yakuza.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.927
To be fair, Ando's pinky
does seem to indicate

03:08.971 --> 03:10.581
that he participated
in yubitsume,

03:10.625 --> 03:11.887
the ritual
by which yakuza

03:11.930 --> 03:13.584
repay their sins
against their clan

03:13.628 --> 03:15.586
by slicing off a finger joint,

03:15.630 --> 03:18.241
but this keyboard
adds an important detail.

03:18.285 --> 03:21.375
There is a lack of grime
on the far left-hand keys.

03:21.418 --> 03:23.855
If you couple that with
the oil-free grooming products

03:23.899 --> 03:26.118
and the silicone repair putty
I found in Ando's bedroom,

03:26.162 --> 03:27.468
it becomes clear
that our victim

03:27.511 --> 03:29.252
wore a prosthetic finger.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.385
And that changes things how?

03:31.428 --> 03:35.258
Active yakuza proudly display
their stumps as a sign of honor.

Ex-members, they do their best
to conceal their criminal pasts.

03:38.653 --> 03:41.264
I think he was a retired yakuza.

03:41.308 --> 03:44.311
Retired or not, this would be
a good way to start a gang war.

03:44.354 --> 03:46.878
Perhaps, but I don't believe
that Ando's death

03:46.922 --> 03:48.358
was the sole objective
of our killer.

03:48.402 --> 03:49.490
Whoever killed him

03:49.533 --> 03:51.056
also took something.

03:52.144 --> 03:53.537

03:53.581 --> 03:56.061
Silicone burns much less
readily than human flesh.

03:56.105 --> 03:58.281
If he were wearing it,
there would be some evidence

03:58.325 --> 04:00.370
of it near the body,
but there isn't,

04:00.414 --> 04:02.067

He was a computer wiz, and they

07:18.699 --> 07:21.702
but Hannah telling
you is a good thing.

07:23.225 --> 07:25.619
It means that she knows
that she needs help

07:25.662 --> 07:27.751
and that she wants your support.

07:27.795 --> 07:30.275
Those are important steps

If you had asked me about her

He said that, uh,
he's got you working

08:12.579 --> 08:14.668
on Ando Azuma's
dark Web account, right?

08:14.711 --> 08:16.670
By "looking into,"
you mean warring

08:16.713 --> 08:19.455
with the most depraved
encryption coding, like, ever?

08:19.499 --> 08:22.153
[Holmes continues shouting]While he's been doing
that for hours?

08:24.504 --> 08:26.462
Mason is indulging
in his generation's

08:26.506 --> 08:28.072
regrettable tendency
towards hyperbole.

08:28.116 --> 08:29.596
The call was only
15 minutes long.

08:29.639 --> 08:31.162
It merely felt eternal.

08:31.206 --> 08:33.730
So, the Tokyo Police
got back to you?

08:33.774 --> 08:35.732
Inspector Natsuo
was enormously helpful.

08:35.775 --> 08:37.255
We just had a bad connection.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.388
He consulted an
informant and confirmed

08:39.431 --> 08:41.303
that after ten years
of faithful service

08:41.346 --> 08:42.957
Ando Azuma retired
from the yakuza.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.915
He sliced off
his pinky,

08:44.959 --> 08:46.917
paid his exit fee
and swore to never again

08:46.961 --> 08:48.440
engage in criminal activity.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.138
Now, yakuzas who retire
with honor,

08:50.181 --> 08:52.619
as Ando did,
are generally left in peace,

08:52.662 --> 08:55.752
so the inspector was surprised
to hear that he'd been murdered.

08:55.796 --> 08:58.059
Why? He could have been killed
by a rival gang member.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.887
You don't spend ten years
in organized crime

08:59.930 --> 09:01.497
without making some enemies.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.760
Well, the inspector
had a theory of his own.

09:03.804 --> 09:05.849
Turns out Ando was not
your typical yakuza thug.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.764
He was what was known
as sokaiya,

09:07.808 --> 09:11.551
a specialist in industrial
espionage and blackmail.

09:11.594 --> 09:13.161
So, that hidden flash drive

09:13.204 --> 09:15.250
that you and Marcus
found out about--

09:15.293 --> 09:17.861
he could have had
blackmail material on it.Mm-hmm.

09:17.905 --> 09:19.341
Would've been
a good place to keep

09:19.384 --> 09:20.560

09:20.603 --> 09:22.387
Sadly, we may
never know

09:22.431 --> 09:25.608
what he was up to, because Mason
has so far failed spectacularly

09:25.652 --> 09:27.784
at cracking Ando's
dark Web account.

09:27.828 --> 09:29.786
I'm starting to wonder
if I should turn

09:29.830 --> 09:31.527
to a computer expert
with more experience.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.181
A member of Everyone, perhaps.

09:33.224 --> 09:34.791
Oh, I'm a hundred times better

09:34.835 --> 09:37.141
than those hacktivist dude-bros,
and you know it.

09:37.185 --> 09:39.622
If you want results, how
about you leave me alone

09:39.666 --> 09:41.450
and let me work?

09:45.976 --> 09:48.152
Do you think you were
a little hard on Mason?

09:48.196 --> 09:50.894
A young man works best when
he has something to prove.

09:50.938 --> 09:52.592
He needs to feel embattled.
Speaking of embattled,

09:52.635 --> 09:54.768
how went your summons to
the captain's chambers?

09:54.811 --> 09:57.031
I assume he wanted an
update on my condition.

09:57.074 --> 10:01.122
Of course he did, because it's
all about you all the time.

10:01.165 --> 10:03.472
He did say he'd be
keeping tabs on me.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.300
[sighs]
Actually, you didn't come up.

10:05.343 --> 10:06.867
Then what did he want?

10:06.910 --> 10:08.999
He's dealing with an issue,
and he wanted my advice.

10:09.043 --> 10:11.393
Why your advice?MASON: Ha! Deal with it!

10:14.352 --> 10:16.833
You really think
some Everyone drone

10:16.877 --> 10:18.618
could've cracked
this kind of ice?

10:18.661 --> 10:20.924
They'd be crying in
their basements.

10:20.968 --> 10:24.841
But no, I destroyed
it like a boss.

10:24.885 --> 10:27.670
WATSON: This account only has
about 30 grand in it.

10:27.714 --> 10:29.150
Oh, no, I know,
right? I mean...

10:29.193 --> 10:30.934
I figured, with this
kind of security,

10:30.978 --> 10:32.675
Ando would've had like
millions of dollars in there.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.329
Instead, it was more
like millions of yen,

10:34.372 --> 10:35.591
but this wasn't
a total bust.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.636
Check this out.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.030
HOLMES:
Regular deposits.

10:40.074 --> 10:42.859
$3,000 a month, all from
yet another dark Web account.

10:42.903 --> 10:45.035
Yeah. You said he was some
kind of blackmailer, right?

10:45.079 --> 10:46.602
I'm betting those are
blackmail payments.

10:46.646 --> 10:47.951
Did you back-trace them?

10:47.995 --> 10:49.649
The money came from
someone named Go Shinura.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.259
I figure he's
another yakuza.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.130
Okay, just because
the victim is Japanese,

10:53.174 --> 10:55.611
it does not necessarily
make him a yakuza.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.569
Watson is correct.
We must not jump to conclusions.

10:57.613 --> 11:00.355
That being said,
Inspector Natsuo e-mailed me

11:00.398 --> 11:02.923
a list of Ando's former
yakuza associates,

11:02.966 --> 11:05.360
with an emphasis on those
currently living in New York,

11:05.403 --> 11:07.101
and guess who's on it?

11:09.538 --> 11:12.454
[men panting][man shouts in Japanese]

11:12.497 --> 11:14.674
[grunting]

11:23.204 --> 11:25.423
[speaking Japanese]

11:25.467 --> 11:28.339
There's something
you wouldn't see in Japan.

11:28.383 --> 11:30.037
Back home, a known yakuza
wouldn't be allowed

11:30.080 --> 11:31.865
anywhere near the sport
of sumo wrestling

11:31.908 --> 11:33.823
for fear you'd fix the matches.

11:33.867 --> 11:36.478
Isn't that right, Mr. Shinura?

11:36.521 --> 11:38.741
We're not in Japan.

11:38.785 --> 11:41.439
We're with the NYPD.
We're here about a murder.

11:41.483 --> 11:44.312
I'm pretty sure that's
against the rules everywhere.

11:48.751 --> 11:50.797
You think Ando
was blackmailing me?

11:50.840 --> 11:53.582
We do. We also think you
got sick of paying him

11:53.625 --> 11:55.323
so you tortured him
until he told you

11:55.366 --> 11:56.628
where he kept his
blackmail material,

11:56.672 --> 11:57.978
and then you
killed him.

11:58.021 --> 12:00.371
[chuckles]

12:00.415 --> 12:03.331
That money I was
sending him every month--

12:03.374 --> 12:05.376
it was to pay off
a gambling debt.

12:05.420 --> 12:08.684
A hundred grand
on the NBA Finals.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.512
Ando won.

12:10.555 --> 12:13.210
Gambling debt is still
motive for murder.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.430
But not for torture
or stealing that...

12:15.473 --> 12:17.562
What did you call it?
"Pinky drive"?

12:17.606 --> 12:20.000
I didn't even know he had that.

12:20.043 --> 12:22.089
Ando was killed between 11:00
and midnight last night.

12:22.132 --> 12:23.481
Can you account for
your whereabouts?

12:23.525 --> 12:25.919
I could, but I won't,

12:25.962 --> 12:28.835
because I don't want
to lose any of my fingers.

12:28.878 --> 12:30.924
Are you saying you were
conducting yakuza business

12:30.967 --> 12:32.447
at the time of his murder?

12:33.753 --> 12:35.667
You realize you
basically admitted

12:35.711 --> 12:38.148
to a motive but no alibi.

12:38.192 --> 12:39.802
I'll admit more than that.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.369
I wanted Ando dead.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.545
He held
that debt over me,

12:43.588 --> 12:46.591
charged me interest,
like a civilian,

12:46.635 --> 12:48.768
but I couldn't
kill him.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.508
Not yet.

12:50.552 --> 12:51.945
"Not yet"?

12:51.988 --> 12:53.685
He was protected,

12:53.729 --> 12:57.080
because he retired
from the yakuza with honor,

12:57.124 --> 12:59.561
but if he violated that honor...

12:59.604 --> 13:01.476
It would be open season on him.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.260
The yakuza frown
on their retired members

13:03.304 --> 13:05.872
resuming
their criminal ways.

13:05.915 --> 13:09.789
Given Ando's carefully concealed
hard drive...

13:09.832 --> 13:12.182
Stands to reason
he was up to something sketchy.

13:12.226 --> 13:13.836
GO: I'd been
following him.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.620
A few nights ago, I saw him

13:15.664 --> 13:18.449
break into
an industrial compound.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.843
I think he robbed the place.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.628
I took pictures,
sent them to Japan.

13:23.672 --> 13:24.934
And?

13:24.978 --> 13:27.154
These things take time.

13:27.197 --> 13:28.590
HOLMES: So, your point
is you're innocent

13:28.633 --> 13:30.592
of Ando Azuma's murder
because you were still

13:30.635 --> 13:32.768
waiting for permission
to kill him?

13:32.812 --> 13:36.554
My point is that if you
are looking for Ando's killer,

13:36.598 --> 13:39.906
you might want to start
with the people he robbed.

13:39.949 --> 13:42.212
This place
looks deserted.

13:42.256 --> 13:44.084
Well, let's hope not.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.650
That was Inspector Natsuo.

13:45.694 --> 13:48.044
His informants
confirmed Go's story.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.481
No one was given permission
to execute Ando,

13:50.525 --> 13:52.092
so unless Go is suicidal...

13:52.135 --> 13:53.702
He's innocent.

13:53.745 --> 13:55.835
Making this our only lead.

13:59.229 --> 14:00.883
Marcus was not
able to identify

14:00.927 --> 14:02.276
the person who owns this place,

14:02.319 --> 14:04.060
so maybe we
should come back in the morning,

14:04.104 --> 14:05.540
wait for someone who
actually works here?

14:05.583 --> 14:07.194
Why would we do that
when we've got

14:07.237 --> 14:09.326
the whole place
to ourselves now?

14:12.286 --> 14:14.288
♪

14:35.831 --> 14:36.832
Freeze!

14:38.921 --> 14:41.141
U.S. Air Force.
On your knees.

14:41.184 --> 14:43.186
Hands behind heads.

14:45.667 --> 14:46.973
Yeah, you were
right, Watson.

14:47.016 --> 14:49.149
We should have waited
till morning.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.943
Red-eyes.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.903
Figured you'd need them,
given how tired I am.

15:03.946 --> 15:06.557
We heard you went to bat
for us last night. Thanks.

15:06.601 --> 15:07.863
Oh, it's not over.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.691
I got two people
from the Air Force

15:09.734 --> 15:12.346
waiting for you
in the conference room.

15:12.389 --> 15:14.304
Seems like they still
have questions

15:14.348 --> 15:17.525
about why you broke
into a U.S. military facility

15:17.568 --> 15:19.483
in the middle of the night.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.311
To be fair, it was an
unmarked military facility.

15:21.355 --> 15:22.791
If there'd been
proper signage,

15:22.834 --> 15:24.662
it would have obviated
the need for a break-in.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.664
Don't tell me. Tell them.

15:26.708 --> 15:28.101
'Cause I get the feeling,

15:28.144 --> 15:29.798
if they don't like
your answers,

15:29.841 --> 15:31.931
you're getting back in the van.

15:33.976 --> 15:36.674
Major Beckam here did background
checks on both of you.

15:36.718 --> 15:37.806
Dr. Watson,

15:37.849 --> 15:38.894
you came back clear.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.156
Mr. Holmes,
on the other hand,

15:40.200 --> 15:42.593
turns out to be a
known foreign agent.

15:42.637 --> 15:44.856
As I said last night,
I've consulted

15:44.900 --> 15:46.597
for a variety of
America's allies.

15:46.641 --> 15:49.513
I'm certainly no enemy
of the United States.

15:49.557 --> 15:50.775
I was told there were questions

15:50.819 --> 15:52.734
regarding
the Ando Azuma homicide,

15:52.777 --> 15:55.389
so why don't we get to it?

15:55.432 --> 15:56.694
That's a capital idea.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.261
Are either of you or
your subordinates

15:58.305 --> 15:59.871
responsible for
Mr. Azuma's murder?

15:59.915 --> 16:03.527
Excuse me? Why would we
have killed Mr. Azuma?

16:03.571 --> 16:05.921
Perhaps to protect
America's nuclear arsenal?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.575
Major Beckam, you are
Air Force Security.

16:07.618 --> 16:11.013
Colonel Deakins has an ICBM
badge on her uniform,

16:11.057 --> 16:12.754
so it's obvious
what her specialization is.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.451
The facility
that my partner and I

16:14.495 --> 16:16.497
attempted to
infiltrate is part of

16:16.540 --> 16:18.803
the nuclear missile
control system, is it not?

16:20.805 --> 16:22.546
Given its lack of radar
and satellite relays,

16:22.590 --> 16:24.984
it can't be a launch site
or an early warning station,

16:25.027 --> 16:27.116
so it must be
a command and control hub?

16:27.160 --> 16:28.813
We know that Ando broke
into the base.

16:28.857 --> 16:30.554
If he uncovered something
that endangered

16:30.598 --> 16:32.600
national security...

16:32.643 --> 16:34.950
You still in touch with
that reporter at The Times?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.691
BECKAM:
We didn't kill
Ando Azuma.

16:36.734 --> 16:38.736
In fact, he was working
for us when he died.

16:38.780 --> 16:41.087
That "break-in" you mentioned--
we paid him to do that.

16:41.130 --> 16:44.525
The U.S. Air Force
wanted a yakuza

16:44.568 --> 16:46.309
to breach one of their bases?

16:46.353 --> 16:48.616
A former yakuza
who'd become one of the top

16:48.659 --> 16:50.792
security consultants
in the country.

16:50.835 --> 16:54.013
What he did was part
of an assessment.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.405
He was thoroughly vetted.

16:55.449 --> 16:57.016
And we can't get
into the details,

16:57.059 --> 16:59.888
but suffice it to say
we're in the process

16:59.931 --> 17:02.847
of testing a sensitive...
upgrade

17:02.891 --> 17:04.848
to some of
our technology.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.415
Likely an upgrade to the current

17:06.460 --> 17:08.679
nuclear missile command
and control network.

17:08.723 --> 17:10.811
It's been reported in
the news that an upgrade

17:10.855 --> 17:12.335
to the network is in the works,

17:12.378 --> 17:14.424
and that's a wise move,
given that the computers

17:14.468 --> 17:16.122
currently running the system
are dinosaurs

17:16.165 --> 17:19.473
from the 1970s that still
use eight-inch floppy disks.

17:19.516 --> 17:23.085
What we need to know now is--
how compromised are we?

17:23.128 --> 17:26.175
It's our understanding
that Ando was tortured.

17:26.219 --> 17:27.915
Did he give anything up?

17:27.959 --> 17:29.483
We're not sure.

17:29.526 --> 17:31.354
But did you know
about his pinky?

17:32.399 --> 17:33.965
What about his pinky?

17:34.009 --> 17:36.968
DEAKINS: We had no idea
he was wearing this.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.448
He had access
to everything--

17:38.492 --> 17:40.363
every computer,
every file...

17:40.407 --> 17:43.714
If we were-- hypothetically--
testing an upgrade

17:43.758 --> 17:45.455
to our missile
control network,

17:45.499 --> 17:47.370
our entire new operating system

17:47.414 --> 17:49.503
could be on that flash drive,

17:49.546 --> 17:51.113
and now it's missing.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.593
I got one question.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.116
No hypotheticals.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.857
How bad is this?

17:55.900 --> 17:57.685
The nukes you control--
are they safe?

17:57.728 --> 17:58.990
A hundred percent.

17:59.034 --> 18:00.862
The system we were testing
isn't linked

18:00.905 --> 18:02.342
to any other bases yet.

18:02.385 --> 18:04.474
But we'll have to put a hold
on our project,

18:04.518 --> 18:06.607
at least until we know
exactly what's on that drive

18:06.650 --> 18:07.999
and where it landed.

18:08.043 --> 18:10.045
What if the data
is in enemy hands?

18:10.089 --> 18:14.658
Then the whole system would need
to be redesigned from scratch.

18:14.702 --> 18:16.878
We'd lose years,

18:16.921 --> 18:19.010
not to mention billions
of dollars.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.537
[door opens]

18:25.495 --> 18:26.757
Any news?

18:26.801 --> 18:28.368
Yes, by which I mean "no."

18:28.411 --> 18:30.326
According to our favorite
Man in Black,

18:30.370 --> 18:32.894
Agent McNally of the NSA,
there's been no chatter

18:32.937 --> 18:34.722
about Ando Azuma's pinky
or its contents

18:34.765 --> 18:37.638
on the world's inter-,
intra- or dark nets.

18:37.681 --> 18:40.771
Could be whoever has it is
sitting on it for some reason.

18:40.815 --> 18:42.295
Or our killer
and his prospective buyers

18:42.338 --> 18:44.210
are being extremely discreet.

18:44.253 --> 18:46.908
There is one other possibility
I think we should look at.

18:46.951 --> 18:48.997
So, while you were out,
the fire marshal

18:49.040 --> 18:50.999
issued her preliminary report
on the fire at Ando's.

18:51.042 --> 18:53.306
Now, she does not think
that the killer

18:53.349 --> 18:55.395
set the fire
to cover his tracks,

18:55.438 --> 18:57.223
but rather it was an accident.

18:57.266 --> 19:00.182
"The fire was the result of
an unattended pan on the stove."

19:00.226 --> 19:02.358
She theorizes
that Ando Azuma was cooking

19:02.402 --> 19:04.055
when he let the killer
into his house.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.753
With no one
to turn down the heat,

19:05.796 --> 19:07.624
the oil in the pan
caught fire.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.583
Now, if she's right,
it would mean

19:09.626 --> 19:12.107
that the killer
left Ando there to be found,

19:12.151 --> 19:14.196
which would have made it easier
for someone to realize

19:14.240 --> 19:16.111
that his prosthetic was missing,
which would've then

19:16.155 --> 19:18.418
made it easier to figure out
what it really was.

19:18.461 --> 19:19.810
His Air Force employers would've

19:19.854 --> 19:21.247
shut down their upgrade
that much sooner,

19:21.290 --> 19:22.726
meaning whoever
possessed the pinky

19:22.770 --> 19:24.380
would no longer be able
to hack America's

19:24.424 --> 19:26.339
nuclear missile system
with impunity.

19:26.382 --> 19:27.775
Which got me thinking--
what if

19:27.818 --> 19:29.385
hacking the system
wasn't the point?

19:29.429 --> 19:31.909
What if all the killer wanted
was to shut it down?

19:31.953 --> 19:33.737
So, according
to some experts,

19:33.781 --> 19:36.262
the '70s-era system that
the military currently uses--

19:36.305 --> 19:37.567
it's called "legacy tech"--

19:37.611 --> 19:40.004
is safer than
any modern replacement

19:40.048 --> 19:42.006
because it's basically
immune to hacking,

19:42.050 --> 19:43.617
so there are plenty of people

19:43.660 --> 19:45.401
who oppose the upgrade
on principle.

19:45.445 --> 19:47.751
The "if it ain't broke,
don't fix it" crowd.

19:47.795 --> 19:50.145
One of the upgrade
opponents stood out.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.235
A blogger who calls himself
Tree-Of-Liberty.

19:56.934 --> 19:59.850
HOLMES: He calls the upgrade
"murderously incompetent."

19:59.894 --> 20:01.243
The more you read,
the more he sounds

20:01.287 --> 20:02.244
like someone
who might kill

20:02.288 --> 20:03.985
to protect our nuclear security.

20:04.028 --> 20:05.769
If he killed Ando Azuma,
he would first

20:05.813 --> 20:07.554
have to have known
that Azuma existed,

20:07.597 --> 20:10.165
and that would suggest he was
involved in the upgrade somehow.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.254
I thought the same thing,
so I looked for insiders

20:12.298 --> 20:14.952
who argued against the upgrade,
and I found this.

20:14.996 --> 20:16.302
It's an op-ed from
the Air Force Ledger

20:16.345 --> 20:17.825
by a General Alvero.

20:17.868 --> 20:19.435
So that highlighted
phrase--

20:19.479 --> 20:22.003
"an existential threat
to America's future"--

20:22.046 --> 20:25.267
also appears in two
of Tree-Of-Liberty's posts.

20:25.311 --> 20:27.269
I found other repetitions, too.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.010
You think Alvero
and Tree-Of-Liberty

20:29.053 --> 20:30.794
are one and the same?

20:30.838 --> 20:32.666
I think, when his op-ed
didn't change anyone's mind,

20:32.709 --> 20:35.495
he created Tree-Of-Liberty
to get more aggressive.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.148
And when that didn't work,

20:37.192 --> 20:40.151
he killed Azuma
to derail the upgrade.

20:40.195 --> 20:43.894
Like you said, it only works as
a theory if he knew about Ando.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.853
I asked the captain to
reach out to the Air Force,

20:45.896 --> 20:47.115
see if Alvero
had any connection

20:47.158 --> 20:48.421
to the base or
the upgrade.

20:48.464 --> 20:49.900
With any luck, we'll
hear back soon.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.686
You know,
you still didn't tell me

20:52.729 --> 20:54.688
what he wanted yesterday,
the captain.

20:54.731 --> 20:56.646
It was private.Well, you can see

20:56.690 --> 20:57.995
how that doesn't alleviate
my concerns

20:58.039 --> 20:59.693
that he was checking up on me.

21:00.781 --> 21:02.696
Look, I'll just go
and ask him myself.

21:04.480 --> 21:07.091
He wanted to talk about Hannah.

21:07.135 --> 21:08.658
His daughter?

21:08.702 --> 21:10.443
A couple of nights ago,

21:10.486 --> 21:13.054
she told him
that she is an alcoholic.

21:13.097 --> 21:14.360
She's going
to meetings,

21:14.403 --> 21:16.187
and she even has her
30-day chip, but...

21:16.231 --> 21:19.060
the captain felt blindsided,
and he blames himself,

21:19.103 --> 21:22.542
so he wanted to talk
about what he should do next.

21:22.585 --> 21:23.891
Huh.

21:23.934 --> 21:25.719
[cell phone chimes]

21:28.765 --> 21:30.289
He heard back from

21:30.332 --> 21:32.291
the lieutenant colonel
we talked to-- Deakins.

21:32.334 --> 21:35.729
So, not only is General Alvero
stationed at her base;

21:35.772 --> 21:37.513
he's her boss.

21:37.557 --> 21:39.776
GREGSON:
Our Computer Crime Squad
thinks it's gonna be

21:39.820 --> 21:42.431
pretty easy to trace
Tree-Of-Liberty's blog

21:42.475 --> 21:44.651
to your home computer, General.

21:44.694 --> 21:46.740
HOLMES:
So, unless you want
us to think that it's

21:46.783 --> 21:49.308
your wife or teenage daughter
who holds the view

21:49.351 --> 21:51.135
that "the Joint Chiefs

21:51.179 --> 21:53.964
can drown in their own
cuck blood..."

21:54.008 --> 21:57.316
I have photos in my phone.

21:57.359 --> 22:00.319
They'll prove
I didn't kill Azuma.

22:00.362 --> 22:01.581
Now...

22:01.624 --> 22:04.497
if I show them to you,
you have to promise

22:04.540 --> 22:06.455
you won't share them
with my colleagues.

22:06.499 --> 22:07.935
I can't make any promises,
General,

22:07.978 --> 22:10.067
but if they prove
you're innocent,

22:10.111 --> 22:12.113
I'm pretty sure
we're done with you.

22:16.770 --> 22:18.989
These photos...

22:19.033 --> 22:21.818
[sighs]

22:21.862 --> 22:24.299
They're of a sensitive nature.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.519
I'd ask Ms. Watson to...

22:26.562 --> 22:28.129
step outside.

22:28.172 --> 22:30.392
"Ms." Watson is a doctor.

22:30.436 --> 22:33.395
There's little she hasn't seen.

22:38.748 --> 22:41.534
I was wrong, Watson.
You likely haven't seen this.

22:47.235 --> 22:50.151
That's what you were doing
the night Azuma was killed?

22:50.194 --> 22:51.631
It relieves stress.

22:51.674 --> 22:53.850
And the woman in
these photos--

22:53.894 --> 22:56.462
she can confirm when
these were taken?

22:56.505 --> 22:58.333
I don't know her real name.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.074
She calls herself Nurse Jessy.

23:00.117 --> 23:02.511
Um, but if you...

23:02.555 --> 23:05.645
hand me the phone,
I can dig up her e-mail.

23:08.125 --> 23:10.301
Listen, you should
take a hard look

23:10.345 --> 23:12.347
at a man named Eddy Dunbridge.

23:12.391 --> 23:13.914
He's got a company
out on the island--

23:13.957 --> 23:15.176
ReIssue Computing.

23:15.219 --> 23:16.743
ReIssue supplies us
with the legacy tech

23:16.786 --> 23:19.789
we use to run
our missile network.

23:19.833 --> 23:22.836
Eddy buys and refurbishes
old computer equipment,

23:22.879 --> 23:24.838
deletes the data,
resells it to us.

23:24.881 --> 23:26.840
Why would a used
computer salesman

23:26.883 --> 23:28.189
want to kill an ex-yakuza?

23:28.232 --> 23:30.234
Once the upgrade
goes through,

23:30.278 --> 23:33.237
the Air Force is going
to destroy all its legacy tech.

23:33.281 --> 23:36.197
[chuckles] Eddy's sitting
on a lot of inventory.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.721
Yeah, old computers,
storage media.

23:38.765 --> 23:40.506
He'll go out of business.

23:40.549 --> 23:42.421
GREGSON: The longer
the upgrade's delayed,

23:42.464 --> 23:44.597
the more of his stock
he can sell to the military?

23:44.640 --> 23:46.076
Mm-hmm.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.730
And how would he have known
about Ando?

23:47.774 --> 23:52.779
Part of how Eddy keeps
his Air Force contract is...

23:52.822 --> 23:54.998
customer relations.

23:55.042 --> 23:58.001
He wines and dines
the big decision makers.

23:58.045 --> 24:00.787
He takes us to dinners,
Yankee games.

24:00.830 --> 24:02.353
At our last dinner,
I may have complained

24:02.397 --> 24:05.226
that our new system
was being tested

24:05.269 --> 24:08.229
by a former yakuza.

24:08.272 --> 24:11.667
I didn't name Ando,

24:11.711 --> 24:14.191
but Eddy is resourceful.

24:14.235 --> 24:17.804
What if he put it together?

24:20.981 --> 24:22.809
[door opens]

24:22.852 --> 24:26.116
[footsteps approaching;
door closes]

24:26.160 --> 24:27.814
Hey, Hannah.

24:27.857 --> 24:30.556
Tell me you remembered
the ginger ale.

24:30.599 --> 24:33.254
I got you covered,
but there's a guy outside,

24:33.297 --> 24:34.734
says he's looking
for the owner

24:34.777 --> 24:36.518
of a parked car
that he just hit.

24:36.562 --> 24:40.304
Don't freak out,
but it's yours.

24:45.919 --> 24:48.008
Hey. You Hannah?

24:48.051 --> 24:49.270
Afraid so.

24:49.313 --> 24:50.619
Yeah, I was just
telling your roommate

24:50.663 --> 24:52.882
I backed into your car. Sorry.

24:52.926 --> 24:55.755
When I was a kid, we used to
call that "parking by feel."

24:55.798 --> 24:57.583
Yeah, uh, I'm an idiot.

24:57.626 --> 25:00.368
I just got this new car
and tried to save money

25:00.411 --> 25:02.109
not getting parking sensors.

25:02.152 --> 25:04.241
There's really not
that much damage.

25:04.285 --> 25:06.548
Well, then it won't
cost much to fix.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.463
Honestly, it's...Please, I insist.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.030
We'll exchange information.

25:10.073 --> 25:13.076
Send me the bill,
and I'll take care of it.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.818
Think I have a notepad
in here somewhere.

25:20.736 --> 25:23.652
Pretty sure most people
would've just driven away.

25:23.696 --> 25:27.395
Well, I guess
I'm not most people.

25:31.399 --> 25:32.792
BELL:
There you are.

25:34.315 --> 25:37.231
Thought maybe I'd driven
to the wrong place.

25:37.274 --> 25:39.494
How did it go
with Nurse Jessy?

25:39.538 --> 25:40.669
[chuckles]

25:40.713 --> 25:42.497
Interesting woman.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.499
She confirmed
General Alvero's story,

25:44.543 --> 25:46.588
then gave me a tour
of her "establishment."

25:46.632 --> 25:48.416
And?

25:48.459 --> 25:50.679
Let's just say there's
a few things I'd like to unsee.

25:50.723 --> 25:51.941
Wh-What-What are we
doing out here?

25:51.985 --> 25:53.813
I thought we were
gonna meet at the home

25:53.856 --> 25:55.075
of that guy
the general mentioned.

25:55.118 --> 25:56.511
Uh, Eddy Dunbridge?

25:56.555 --> 25:58.382
We were, but when we
got to Eddy's home,

25:58.426 --> 26:00.123
the door was ajar,
and he was gone.

26:00.167 --> 26:02.604
Looked like he left in a hurry.
We found his cell phone

26:02.648 --> 26:04.301
on the kitchen counter
with the battery removed,

26:04.345 --> 26:06.173
along with his ATM
and credit cards.

26:06.216 --> 26:07.609
Think he's on the run?

26:07.653 --> 26:09.132
Watson's at the house now

26:09.176 --> 26:11.004
with a few detectives
in case he comes back,

26:11.047 --> 26:13.659
but I noticed the empty box
to a new pair of boat shoes

26:13.702 --> 26:15.574
in the mess he made
when he was packing.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.967
That and some framed photographs
of him on a fishing boat

26:18.011 --> 26:19.795
made us think he might
have sailed away,

26:19.839 --> 26:21.449
but when I looked
into his boat,

26:21.492 --> 26:24.104
it wasn't at sea;
it was here.

26:24.147 --> 26:26.149
Now, the boat's not
going anywhere,

26:26.193 --> 26:28.108
but that doesn't mean
he's not on it.

26:29.588 --> 26:33.853
So, Eddy's boat
was assigned...

26:33.896 --> 26:36.116
spot 63.

26:36.159 --> 26:38.335
Should be one of these.

26:38.379 --> 26:40.337
[gunfire]

26:43.427 --> 26:44.907
Police!

26:44.951 --> 26:47.083
Drop your weapon
and show yourself!

26:47.127 --> 26:49.564
MAN:
You gotta help me! I'm stuck!

26:49.608 --> 26:51.740
What do you mean, "stuck"?

26:51.784 --> 26:53.394
I wasn't firing at you.

26:53.437 --> 26:56.223
I had to shoot the glass out
so you could hear me.

26:56.266 --> 26:58.486
My name's Eddy Dunbridge.

26:58.529 --> 27:00.140
I've been here
for days--

27:00.183 --> 27:02.055
ever since they
tried to kill me.

27:02.098 --> 27:03.839
Who tried to kill you?

27:03.883 --> 27:05.232
I don't know.

27:05.275 --> 27:07.321
They hit me on the head,
then zip-tied me.

27:07.364 --> 27:09.366
Just like Ando Azuma.

27:09.410 --> 27:10.846
I ran here to hide,

27:10.890 --> 27:12.979
but I sort of broke
the door handle

27:13.022 --> 27:15.024
when I tried
to barricade the hatch.

27:15.068 --> 27:17.897
Listen, Eddy, I'm gonna
call ESU to get you out,

27:17.940 --> 27:19.942
but you gotta show
me your hands.

27:24.425 --> 27:25.774
Look at his wrists.

27:25.818 --> 27:28.298
He was telling the truth
about being zip-tied.

27:28.342 --> 27:29.560
Not only is he
not our killer...

27:29.604 --> 27:32.172
He was almost
another victim.

27:38.787 --> 27:40.702
[knock at door]Come in.

27:40.746 --> 27:43.357
Eddy Dunbridge
should be here soon.

27:43.400 --> 27:46.795
E.R. patched him up,
rehydrated him.

27:46.839 --> 27:49.711
He suffered a concussion
but should recover.

27:49.755 --> 27:52.801
Common theme these days.
[chuckles]

27:52.845 --> 27:55.891
Surveillance from the boatyard
shows him arriving

27:55.935 --> 27:59.678
five days ago,
and he never left.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.723
How sure are we that
what happened to him

28:01.767 --> 28:03.899
is connected to what
happened to Ando Azuma?

28:03.943 --> 28:05.596
Both men were attacked
in a similar fashion--

28:05.640 --> 28:07.250
a blow to the back of the head,

28:07.294 --> 28:08.730
followed by a binding
of the wrists,

28:08.774 --> 28:10.166
and it appears
that the same brand

28:10.210 --> 28:12.299
of zip tie was used
on both occasions.

28:13.561 --> 28:15.563
Anything else?

28:16.912 --> 28:18.871
You were wondering
if you missed something.

28:20.176 --> 28:21.917
With Hannah.

28:21.961 --> 28:25.660
I know about
her recent disclosure.

28:27.053 --> 28:28.707
You might be concerned
that her addiction

28:28.750 --> 28:30.621
was triggered
by some genetic issue

28:30.665 --> 28:33.407
or failure in parenting,
and-and that's quite normal.

28:33.450 --> 28:35.583
Although, to be fair,
I usually hear these stories

28:35.626 --> 28:37.977
from the side of the addicts,
not their families.

28:38.020 --> 28:41.458
What makes you think I want
to talk about this with you?

28:41.502 --> 28:44.244
Nothing. I know you don't,
but this is not about me or you.

28:44.287 --> 28:47.290
It's about Hannah
and her sobriety.

28:49.989 --> 28:54.341
Worrying about the origin of
her issues is counterproductive.

28:54.384 --> 28:58.562
In doing so, you risk making
her substance abuse about you,

28:58.606 --> 29:01.870
when, in fact, your energy
and hers are best spent

29:01.914 --> 29:03.393
focusing on her recovery.

29:03.437 --> 29:04.873
You think I don't know that?

29:04.917 --> 29:06.875
I think that you're in pain,
and...

29:06.919 --> 29:09.965
despite our recent troubles,
that bothers me.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.187
Look, my father
was an abject failure

29:14.230 --> 29:16.624
as both a parent
and a human being,

29:16.667 --> 29:18.365
but when it came
to my own struggles,

29:18.408 --> 29:19.801
he did one thing right.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.977
He kept my recovery about me.

29:22.021 --> 29:25.589
You're ten times
the man that he is,

29:25.633 --> 29:27.243
so if he can do right by me,

29:27.287 --> 29:29.376
I'm confident that you
can do right by Hannah--

29:29.419 --> 29:32.335
but only once
you move past blame.

29:35.295 --> 29:38.733
Let me know how things go
with Dunbridge.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.566
[door closes]

29:45.609 --> 29:47.742
They hit me from behind.
I'm an insomniac,

29:47.786 --> 29:50.092
so I got to work
around 4:00 a.m.,

29:50.136 --> 29:53.617
but when I got to my office,
someone was waiting for me.

29:53.661 --> 29:54.923
They bashed me in the head,

29:54.967 --> 29:56.925
and I woke up zip-tied
in a closet.

29:56.969 --> 29:58.622
Big mistake.

29:58.666 --> 30:01.016
I watch all those
survival shows on TV,

30:01.060 --> 30:03.366
so I know how
to break out of zip ties.

30:03.410 --> 30:05.542
I snapped 'em in half,
then escaped out a window

30:05.586 --> 30:07.414
before they could come back
and finish me off.

30:07.457 --> 30:10.417
HOLMES:
At this point, Mr. Dunbridge,
only one thing is certain.

30:10.460 --> 30:12.201
No one wanted you dead.

30:12.245 --> 30:14.769
The person who attacked you
killed a former yakuza.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.771
If your assailant
had wanted you dead,

30:16.815 --> 30:18.077
they would have slit your throat

30:18.120 --> 30:19.818
as they did
with their other victim.

30:19.861 --> 30:22.516
BELL:
Yeah, it sounds more like
you interrupted a burglary

30:22.559 --> 30:25.519
and the perp thumped you
to get you out of the way.

30:25.562 --> 30:27.260
Well, if that's correct,
the question becomes--

30:27.303 --> 30:29.523
what did the intruder want?

30:29.566 --> 30:31.133
And did they kill
Ando Azuma

30:31.177 --> 30:34.267
two nights later
because they didn't find it...

30:34.310 --> 30:35.834
or because they did?

30:38.445 --> 30:41.143
[sighs]

30:41.187 --> 30:43.624
HOLMES: Now, the last time
you were in this position,

30:43.667 --> 30:45.234
do you remember
seeing anything?

30:45.278 --> 30:46.540
No.

30:46.583 --> 30:48.063
I mean, I was seeing stars.

30:48.107 --> 30:50.457
My head hurt.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.415
Wait. I remember
hearing something

30:52.459 --> 30:54.722
before I got put in the closet.

30:54.765 --> 30:57.856
The copier was running.

31:02.686 --> 31:06.038
This is set to make
eight-and-a-half-by-14 copies.

31:06.081 --> 31:08.562
Last ones I made
were regular sized,

31:08.605 --> 31:10.651
and no one was in here
while I was gone.

31:10.694 --> 31:12.131
I don't have
any permanent staff.

31:12.174 --> 31:14.785
Must have copied something
from your records.

31:17.832 --> 31:21.227
These are eight and a half
by 14.

31:21.270 --> 31:23.838
"Acquisitions
and Sales."

31:25.971 --> 31:28.843
The dust has been
disturbed on this one.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.286
Those are records for a batch
of eight-inch floppy disks

31:37.330 --> 31:38.418
I bought at auction.

31:38.461 --> 31:42.422
July 2015, thousand-count.

31:42.465 --> 31:45.599
Resold them to missile bases
all over the country.

31:45.642 --> 31:47.601
It's our understanding
you delete your disks

31:47.644 --> 31:49.298
before you send them
to your customers.

31:49.342 --> 31:52.214
Could there be valuable
data on them nonetheless?

31:52.258 --> 31:53.955
Oh, with legacy tech,
anything you delete

31:53.999 --> 31:55.696
can theoretically be undeleted,

31:55.739 --> 31:57.785
but as for what's on them,
I don't check.

31:57.828 --> 31:59.743
Considering someone
went to all this trouble,

31:59.787 --> 32:01.876
good chance they think
there's something valuable

32:01.920 --> 32:03.617
on one of those disks.

32:03.660 --> 32:06.446
If that's true,
finding our killer

32:06.489 --> 32:08.665
would mean doing what
they're likely doing--

32:08.709 --> 32:11.712
tracking down every
last one of these disks

32:11.755 --> 32:14.541
and identifying the one or
ones worth killing over,

32:14.584 --> 32:16.282
and that's no mean feat,
considering they've been

32:16.325 --> 32:17.892
shipped all over
the country.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.894
EDDY:
They haven't.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.591
I mean, not all of them, anyway.

32:21.635 --> 32:23.463
My sales ledgers
record sales,

32:23.506 --> 32:24.768
not deliveries.

32:24.812 --> 32:25.900
Disks aren't
actually shipped

32:25.944 --> 32:27.162
until they're needed.

32:27.206 --> 32:29.773
Yeah, I've still got
a few boxes on hand.

32:29.817 --> 32:31.514
Want to see 'em?

32:33.255 --> 32:35.823
[rapid typing]

32:35.866 --> 32:38.260
And boom.

32:38.304 --> 32:40.001
Easy-peasy.

32:40.045 --> 32:42.438
A lot of these disks
weren't even properly deleted.

32:42.482 --> 32:45.920
I'm printing out hard copies
of the first batch of data.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.227
Most of these disks are from
some stationery company.

32:48.270 --> 32:51.795
We got orders, cost projections,
inventory sheets,

32:51.839 --> 32:53.536
paper milling instructions.

32:53.580 --> 32:54.581
What's the name of the company?

32:54.624 --> 32:56.365
Uh...

32:56.409 --> 32:57.932
Crake & Rail.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.238
They're still around.

32:59.281 --> 33:02.589
Oh, I see you bought
a new fridge

33:02.632 --> 33:03.677
while I was out.

33:03.720 --> 33:04.939
It's legacy tech--

33:04.983 --> 33:06.767
on loan from
Mr. Eddy Dunbridge.

33:06.810 --> 33:09.030
How was your meeting
with the fire marshal?

33:09.074 --> 33:11.380
She says that her final report
on the fire at Ando's

33:11.424 --> 33:12.860
won't come out for a few hours,

33:12.903 --> 33:14.601
but she is officially ruling it
an accident.

33:14.644 --> 33:16.081
Based on
the burn patterns

33:16.124 --> 33:18.257
around the stove and the
charred materials in the pan,

33:18.300 --> 33:21.608
Ando had just started frying up
some hot peppers and garlic

33:21.651 --> 33:23.392
when the killer interrupted.

33:23.436 --> 33:25.046
Hot peppers and garlic?

33:25.090 --> 33:26.787
Yeah. Why?

33:26.830 --> 33:28.528
Well, the smell would have
filled the apartment.

33:28.571 --> 33:30.399
So?So you can go home.

33:30.443 --> 33:33.011
But I still have all those
disks to go through.

33:33.054 --> 33:34.273
That won't be necessary.

33:34.316 --> 33:36.579
Not only do I now have
a very good idea

33:36.623 --> 33:40.105
why Ando Azuma was murdered,
but I think the fire marshal

33:40.148 --> 33:42.977
has just given us a way
to root out the killer.

33:44.718 --> 33:47.286
This is the reason
Ando Azuma was murdered.

33:47.329 --> 33:49.462
Or at least half of it.

33:49.505 --> 33:50.637
This disk came from

33:50.680 --> 33:52.204
Eddy Dunbridge's
warehouse,

33:52.247 --> 33:55.729
but it originated at a
company called Crake & Rail,

33:55.772 --> 33:58.819
a stationery company who make,
amongst other products,

33:58.862 --> 34:02.170
the paper upon which all
American currency is printed.

34:02.214 --> 34:04.825
WATSON: Naturally, the recipe
is a closely guarded secret,

34:04.868 --> 34:06.392
and even though
the Treasury Department

34:06.435 --> 34:08.176
has added raised ink,
holograms

34:08.219 --> 34:10.396
and other security features
to our money,

34:10.438 --> 34:13.051
the recipe
has not changed in decades.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.661
HOLMES: Technically,
it's not even paper.

34:14.704 --> 34:16.141
It's a textile.

34:16.184 --> 34:18.186
It's a blend of cotton,
linen and other fibers.

34:18.230 --> 34:21.494
It's what gives American money
its look, weight, feel.

34:21.536 --> 34:23.148
These old disks don't
store much data,

34:23.190 --> 34:26.281
so Crake & Rail had to split
the recipe onto two disks:

34:26.324 --> 34:29.154
that one, Disk B, and
its companion, called--

34:29.197 --> 34:31.112
big surprise-- Disk A.

34:31.156 --> 34:33.636
If a counterfeiter got his
hands on both of them,

34:33.679 --> 34:35.681
he could literally
print money.

34:35.725 --> 34:38.598
GREGSON: I spoke with
Crake & Rail's CEO this morning.

34:38.641 --> 34:41.121
He confirmed the authenticity
of the recipe.

34:41.166 --> 34:42.993
He also said
that the disks

34:43.036 --> 34:45.822
were probably
accidentally recycled

34:45.866 --> 34:48.695
when the company upgraded
their computers in the '90s.

34:48.737 --> 34:50.262
WATSON: Eventually,
the disks made their way

34:50.304 --> 34:53.917
to Eddy Dunbridge, who had
no idea what they contained,

34:53.960 --> 34:56.311
so he deleted them,
and then he added them

34:56.355 --> 34:58.313
to his inventory
of legacy tech.

34:58.357 --> 35:00.359
HOLMES:
Sometime later, Disk A

35:00.402 --> 35:01.751
was included in a batch

35:01.795 --> 35:04.754
that was delivered
to your secret facility,

35:04.798 --> 35:07.888
which is how it made its way
onto one of your desks.

35:07.931 --> 35:10.760
Are you approaching anything
resembling a point?

35:10.804 --> 35:12.501
My point is that
one of you realized

35:12.545 --> 35:15.113
you'd stumbled upon
one half of a lottery ticket

35:15.156 --> 35:16.940
with an infinite number
of zeros,

35:16.984 --> 35:19.421
and all you needed to cash it
was the other half--

35:19.465 --> 35:21.075
Disk B.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.946
A few days ago,
one of you

35:22.990 --> 35:26.515
broke into Eddy Dunbridge's
warehouse and copied a list

35:26.559 --> 35:30.084
of all the bases that had
bought Crake & Rail's disks,

35:30.128 --> 35:32.130
hoping to track it down.

35:32.173 --> 35:34.567
But the guilty party
had a problem.

35:34.610 --> 35:39.746
Even with the list, you would
need time to find Disk B.

35:39.789 --> 35:42.227
Time that,
with the impending upgrade

35:42.270 --> 35:43.793
to the Air Force's
missile control system,

35:43.837 --> 35:45.186
you just didn't have.

35:45.230 --> 35:47.841
Legacy tech at bases
all across the country,

35:47.884 --> 35:50.887
including Disk B,
was about to be binned.

35:50.931 --> 35:52.628
That's when one of
you had an idea:

35:52.672 --> 35:54.630
kill the guy
who was testing

35:54.674 --> 35:57.503
the new system's
security-- Ando Azuma.

35:57.546 --> 36:00.462
The fallout would compel the
Air Force to slam on the brakes,

36:00.506 --> 36:02.464
make sure they
weren't compromised.

36:02.508 --> 36:04.510
Suddenly, there'd
be more time

36:04.553 --> 36:06.120
to find the missing disk.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.991
This is outrageous.

36:08.035 --> 36:09.210
[cell phone ringing]

36:09.254 --> 36:11.995
Oh, sorry.

36:12.039 --> 36:15.347
Sorry. I'm-I'm suffering
from a condition called PCS.

36:15.390 --> 36:17.000
I, um... [clears throat]

36:17.044 --> 36:19.699
I just... I have to eat
regularly to stave off the, uh,

36:19.742 --> 36:21.396
symptoms, so if
you don't mind...

36:21.440 --> 36:23.181
What the hell is that?

36:23.224 --> 36:25.487
Again, apologies.

36:25.531 --> 36:27.359
The mingled stench
of rotting flesh,

36:27.402 --> 36:28.882
ammonia and gym socks

36:28.925 --> 36:30.362
is the hallmark
odor of the durian.

36:30.405 --> 36:31.841
It's a fruit from
Southeast Asia.

36:31.885 --> 36:34.235
My doctor says its blend
of minerals and vitamins

36:34.279 --> 36:36.150
is highly therapeutic.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.196
It also just helped us
identify the killer.

36:38.239 --> 36:40.415
Hmm. Colonel Deakins...

36:41.721 --> 36:44.027
...would you join us
in an interview room?

36:47.205 --> 36:49.903
BELL:
You want to have
a seat, Colonel?

36:49.946 --> 36:52.035
No, I don't.
I'm not staying.

36:52.079 --> 36:54.908
I-I just want to know, why
do you think I killed Ando?

36:54.951 --> 36:56.344
Your nose gave you away.

36:56.388 --> 36:58.259
Everyone else had
an involuntary reaction

36:58.303 --> 37:00.043
to the durian's stench.

37:00.087 --> 37:02.394
But not you.
You had no reaction whatsoever.

37:02.437 --> 37:04.222
Fine. You got me.

37:04.265 --> 37:06.485
I-I have no sense of smell.

37:06.528 --> 37:09.139
Head injury at the academy.

37:09.183 --> 37:11.054
What does that have
to do with anything?

37:11.098 --> 37:13.274
It has to do with
the fire at Ando's--

37:13.318 --> 37:15.537
the one that almost
ruined your plan.

37:15.581 --> 37:17.235
What plan?
WATSON: You knew
the Air Force

37:17.278 --> 37:18.671
would investigate
his death.

37:18.714 --> 37:20.063
You wanted them to realize

37:20.107 --> 37:21.804
that his prosthetic finger
was missing.

37:21.848 --> 37:24.894
When it came out that there
was a hidden thumb drive in it,

37:24.938 --> 37:26.244
they would panic.

37:26.287 --> 37:27.593
You're forgetting something.

37:27.636 --> 37:30.291
No one knew he had
a fake finger.

37:30.335 --> 37:31.771
We don't think
that's true.

37:31.814 --> 37:33.903
You're the one
who hired him, correct?

37:33.947 --> 37:35.340
We're guessing
he disclosed it to you,

37:35.383 --> 37:37.080
but you kept it
to yourself.

37:37.124 --> 37:39.474
You were gonna tell everyone
about it after he was dead.

37:39.518 --> 37:42.390
HOLMES: Just one problem--
you let a pan full of oil,

37:42.434 --> 37:44.653
garlic and peppers
burn down his apartment.

37:44.697 --> 37:45.959
Anyone else would have

37:46.002 --> 37:49.005
noticed the smell
and shut off the stove,

37:49.049 --> 37:50.180
but not you.

37:50.224 --> 37:51.530
The sooner
you cop to it,

37:51.573 --> 37:53.183
the better it's
gonna go for you.

37:56.143 --> 37:57.971
Colonel.

37:59.189 --> 38:01.017
We'll be watching you.

38:01.061 --> 38:03.019
Watch all you want.

38:03.063 --> 38:05.065
You're fishing.

38:05.108 --> 38:06.806
And I'm not biting.

38:22.343 --> 38:24.302
Mr. Shinura.

38:24.345 --> 38:26.391
Call me Go.

38:26.434 --> 38:28.175
You weren't
followed, were you?

38:28.218 --> 38:29.872
No. Positive.

38:33.223 --> 38:35.356
Your new passport.

38:35.400 --> 38:38.054
I hope you like the
name Laura Harrison.

38:38.098 --> 38:39.969
If you don't...

38:41.406 --> 38:43.233
...this should help
you get used to it.

38:45.714 --> 38:47.237
Yeah.

38:47.281 --> 38:50.284
Lieutenant Colonel Deakins
was done anyway.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.504
Air Force made that clear
when they passed me over

38:52.547 --> 38:54.244
for full-bird colonel.

38:54.288 --> 38:56.203
Might as well
retire in style.

38:56.246 --> 38:58.336
After you give me
what I asked for.

38:58.379 --> 38:59.902
Of course.

39:10.348 --> 39:14.308
I must confess, when our
informant in the NYPD

39:14.352 --> 39:17.572
told me you are the one
accused of murdering Ando,

39:17.616 --> 39:19.313
I was skeptical.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.010
Ando was yakuza.

39:21.054 --> 39:22.882
He could defend himself.

39:22.925 --> 39:25.188
Just a reminder--
the drive is encrypted.

39:25.232 --> 39:27.016
Your boss said
that would be okay.

39:29.149 --> 39:32.805
My oyabunsays this was
a worthwhile investment.

39:32.848 --> 39:35.547
There could be anything
on this drive--

39:35.590 --> 39:39.202
information that could
hurt our organization,

39:39.246 --> 39:42.597
data we could sell, or
perhaps it's nothing.

39:42.641 --> 39:45.600
In which case we are
paying for peace of mind.

39:45.644 --> 39:49.604
Regardless, this
concludes our business.

39:49.648 --> 39:52.564
Please, enjoy
your retirement.

39:52.607 --> 39:55.305
I plan to.

39:55.349 --> 39:57.699
Uh, please, you must tell me...

40:00.180 --> 40:02.530
How did you manage
to best Ando?

40:03.662 --> 40:06.360
How did you kill him?

40:06.404 --> 40:09.885
Why the hell do you care
so much how I...

40:09.929 --> 40:11.800
BELL:
NYPD.

40:11.844 --> 40:14.412
Keep your hands where I can
see 'em, Colonel Deakins.

40:15.804 --> 40:17.632
We owe you an apology.

40:17.676 --> 40:19.329
We told you we'd
be watching

40:19.373 --> 40:22.289
but neglected to say
we'd be listening also.

40:22.332 --> 40:23.986
You got enough?

40:24.030 --> 40:25.510
Mm... full confession

40:25.553 --> 40:27.381
might have been too
much to hope for,

40:27.425 --> 40:29.296
but we have the
pinky, so...

40:29.339 --> 40:30.863
I'd say you're done.

40:30.906 --> 40:33.300
As are you, Colonel.

40:35.345 --> 40:37.522
You did good, Mr. Shinura.

40:37.565 --> 40:38.914
Department
appreciates you

40:38.958 --> 40:40.742
holding up your end
of the deal.

40:40.786 --> 40:42.527
We are through?

40:42.570 --> 40:44.354
So long as you're
on a plane

40:44.398 --> 40:47.270
to Japan in the next 24 hours,
we don't see any reason to dig

40:47.314 --> 40:50.404
into the offshore account you
were using to pay Ando Azuma.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.797
That's great.

40:51.840 --> 40:54.147
But I didn't do this for me.

40:54.190 --> 40:56.541
I did this for Ando.

40:56.584 --> 41:00.632
No one kills a yakuza
but a yakuza.
