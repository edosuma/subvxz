00:02.000 --> 00:03.149
Men...

00:04.320 --> 00:07.357
...flip around the television
more than women, I think.

00:08.880 --> 00:10.552
Men get that remote control
in their hands...

00:10.720 --> 00:12.676
They don't even know
what they're not watching.

00:12.840 --> 00:15.195
"Rerun, don't wanna watch it."
"What are you watching?"

00:15.360 --> 00:17.112
"Don't care." "Who was that?"
"Don't know."

00:17.280 --> 00:19.999
"Isn't that your father?"
"Doesn't matter, I gotta keep going."

00:21.280 --> 00:23.510
Women don't do that.
See, now, women...

00:23.680 --> 00:26.877
...will stop and go, "Well,
let me see what the show is...

00:27.040 --> 00:29.110
...before I change the channel."

00:29.280 --> 00:31.475
You see, but men just fly.
Because women...

00:31.640 --> 00:34.950
You see, women nest,
and men hunt.

00:35.120 --> 00:37.270
That's why we watch TV differently.

00:39.200 --> 00:43.159
Before there was flipping around,
before there was television...

00:43.320 --> 00:45.356
...kings and emperors
and pharaohs and such...

00:45.520 --> 00:47.795
...had storytellers that would
tell them stories.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.188
That was their entertainment.

00:49.360 --> 00:53.035
I always wonder in that era if they
would get 30 storytellers together...

00:53.200 --> 00:55.031
...so they could still flip around.
Just go:

00:55.200 --> 00:57.475
"Tell me your story.
I don't wanna hear anymore.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.551
Shut up. Next guy.
What are you talking about?

00:59.720 --> 01:01.517
Is there a girl in that story?
No? Shut up.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.557
What have you got?
I don't wanna hear that.

01:03.720 --> 01:05.756
What are you talking about?
Don't wanna hear it.

01:05.920 --> 01:08.388
Now, the whole of you,
get out of here. I'm going to bed."

01:13.920 --> 01:15.399
She's pregnant?

01:16.000 --> 01:19.549
Leslie is pregnant?
Oh, see, there is no justice.

01:19.720 --> 01:21.278
She's the performance artist, right?

01:21.440 --> 01:24.398
Yeah, performance artist.
She's a performer, a real trouper.

01:24.680 --> 01:27.194
What's her husband's name again?
Chip?

01:27.360 --> 01:28.588
Kip?

01:28.800 --> 01:30.028
Skip?

01:30.640 --> 01:32.596
- Todd.
- Todd.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.751
Oh, yeah.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.672
- He's a Kennedy.
- No, he's not.

01:36.840 --> 01:40.116
- Come on, he's a third cousin.
- By marriage.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.875
Oh, by marriage, yeah.
We went to the wedding.

01:43.040 --> 01:44.951
Should've heard them talk
about Chappaquiddick.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.680
Tried to blame the whole thing
on bad directions.

01:47.840 --> 01:50.400
That woman was unequivocally
the worst date of my life.

01:51.120 --> 01:55.318
Pardon me for setting you up
with a beautiful, intelligent woman.

01:55.480 --> 01:58.392
What, you don't think I can attract
beautiful, intelligent women?

01:58.560 --> 02:02.235
Thin ice, George, very thin ice.

02:02.640 --> 02:05.552
Maybe for her new performance
piece, she'll give birth on-stage.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.913
She stopped performing.

02:08.080 --> 02:10.877
What a huge blow to the culture.

02:11.039 --> 02:14.237
You believe this guy?
He holds a grudge like Khomeini.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.072
She dragged me down
to that warehouse...

02:16.240 --> 02:19.312
...on the waterfront in Brooklyn
to see one of her performances.

02:19.680 --> 02:22.831
Oh, and she's on-stage cooking
dinner for some celebrity?

02:23.320 --> 02:24.594
God.

02:24.760 --> 02:26.910
She's cooking dinner for God.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.957
She's yelling,
and the next thing I know...

02:29.120 --> 02:32.476
...she throws a big can of chocolate
syrup all over my new red shirt.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.870
- It was an accident.
- Oh, yeah, accident, right.

02:35.040 --> 02:37.600
She was aiming at me,
like she was putting out a fire.

02:38.080 --> 02:41.152
So for the rest of the show I'm sitting
there with chocolate all over me.

02:41.320 --> 02:43.788
Flies are landing on me.

02:43.960 --> 02:47.032
I'm boiling, I'm fantasizing
all the things I'm gonna say to her.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.270
Later, finally, backstage,
when I talk to her...

02:49.440 --> 02:51.396
...l'm like a little grovelling worm:

02:51.560 --> 02:53.676
"What kind of chocolate was that?"

02:53.840 --> 02:55.990
"Do you throw any other foods?"
You know...

02:56.160 --> 02:57.479
He thought he still had a shot.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.994
Then, then, then...

03:01.160 --> 03:02.991
...she leaves with somebody else.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.752
Never even...
Never even said goodbye.

03:05.920 --> 03:08.229
Never called me back.
Never apologized. Nothing.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.152
Like I was dirt.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.236
What ever happened with the shirt?

03:14.280 --> 03:15.508
I still have it.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.598
The collar's okay.
I wear it under sweaters.

03:19.520 --> 03:20.839
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.036
She asked me to give her
a baby shower.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.714
Asked you?
You're not gonna do that, are you?

03:26.080 --> 03:29.277
Anyone else, never.
But Leslie...

03:29.440 --> 03:31.032
I have a problem saying no to her.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.270
For some reason,
I seem to want her approval.

03:33.440 --> 03:36.398
Let Maria Shriver
give her a baby shower.

03:36.560 --> 03:39.028
Ask not what I can do for you,
ask what you can do for me.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.349
Ich bin ein sucker.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.831
Would you two stop
with the Kennedys?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.753
Why does everyone make such
a big deal about the Kennedys?

03:46.920 --> 03:51.152
I mean, what is this fascination?
Who cares? It's all so boring.

03:51.320 --> 03:53.197
Look, she doesn't deserve
a baby shower.

03:53.360 --> 03:56.796
She deserves a baby monsoon.
She deserves Rosemary's baby.

03:59.360 --> 04:02.193
I do have one teeny
little problem, though.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.999
Never said goodbye.
Never apologized. Nothing.

04:07.320 --> 04:11.711
See, I was gonna give
the shower in my apartment...

04:11.880 --> 04:14.792
- But?
- My roommate has Lyme disease.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.678
Lyme disease? I thought she had
Epstein-Barr syndrome.

04:17.839 --> 04:20.399
She has this in addition
to Epstein-Barr.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.950
It's like Epstein-Barr
with a twist of Lyme disease.

04:24.120 --> 04:27.317
- How'd she get Lyme disease?
- I don't know.

04:27.480 --> 04:30.756
She did some outdoor version of Hair
in Danbury, Connecticut.

04:30.920 --> 04:33.229
- They still do that play?
- It's a classic.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.357
- With the nudity?
- I guess.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.197
She must've rolled over
on a tick during the love-in.

04:41.760 --> 04:44.672
Never said goodbye. Goodbye.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.630
Explain to me how
this baby shower thing works.

04:48.160 --> 04:49.434
What do you want to know?

04:49.600 --> 04:53.115
Well, I mean does it ever erupt
into a drunken orgy of violence?

04:54.600 --> 04:56.158
Rarely.

04:56.320 --> 04:59.835
There's no hazing of the foetus
or anything, is there?

05:01.280 --> 05:02.793
No.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.916
- When is this supposed to be?
- Saturday.

05:05.080 --> 05:08.834
Saturday. Well, I have a show
in Buffalo on Saturday.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.036
They're not gonna bust up
my apartment, are they?

05:11.200 --> 05:12.952
No, I'll take full responsibility.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.633
Because I've seen pregnant women...

05:14.800 --> 05:17.155
...and they sometimes
misjudge their foetal girth.

05:17.320 --> 05:18.514
And they'll...

05:18.680 --> 05:22.275
Just, like, one wrong turn, the whole
buffet is, like, right off the table.

05:22.880 --> 05:25.440
Someday, before I die,
mark my words...

05:25.600 --> 05:27.795
...l'm gonna tell that woman
what I think of her.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.679
I'll never be able
to forgive myself until I do.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.876
- And if you do?
- I still won't forgive myself...

05:33.040 --> 05:35.349
...but at least it won't be about this.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:44.000 --> 05:46.275
What are you doing this for?
Look at you.

05:46.440 --> 05:49.113
- Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.
- But you don't have to.

05:49.280 --> 05:51.953
- The guy is waiting in my house.
- Leave me alone.

05:52.120 --> 05:54.429
It's a one-time fee, 150 bucks.

05:54.600 --> 05:58.036
- Why live like this?
- I'm not getting illegal cable.

05:58.640 --> 06:02.394
So you're gonna wait for the cable
companies to resolve their dispute?

06:02.720 --> 06:03.994
They'll be in court for years.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.912
- I read in the paper...
- Oh, the paper...

06:06.080 --> 06:09.311
- They might hook us up again.
- Oh, God. You're so naive.

06:09.480 --> 06:13.109
All the cable companies care about
is the big "mamoo."

06:14.840 --> 06:18.230
Look at you. You're banging things.
You're just pathetic.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.630
Just wasting your life.

06:20.800 --> 06:23.360
I'm offering you 56 channels.

06:23.520 --> 06:28.514
Movies, sports, nudity,
and it's free for life!

06:28.800 --> 06:30.711
Stop shouting.
You're ruining the reception.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.677
Can you hear yourself?
Can...?

06:32.840 --> 06:35.070
Do you know what you're saying?

06:35.240 --> 06:38.516
- What you're suggesting is illegal.
- It's not illegal.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.513
- It's against the law.
- Well, yeah.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.311
Just hold this.
Can you hold that?

06:46.480 --> 06:48.948
Look, will you at least
let me bring the guy over?

06:49.120 --> 06:51.395
He's an amazing man.
He's a Russian immigrant.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.152
He escaped from the Gulag.

06:53.320 --> 06:56.278
He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.

06:56.640 --> 06:59.757
He'll slow down your gas meter.
He sells slugs, Jerry.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.673
Slugs for the subway.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.479
- He's a real human-rights nut, huh?
- Yeah.

07:05.840 --> 07:07.159
He's intense, man.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.033
I don't know.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.509
- What if I get caught?
- You're not gonna get caught.

07:11.680 --> 07:15.878
Let me get him in. It's the '90s.
It's Hammer Time. Come on.

07:16.040 --> 07:17.837
Just let me get him.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.309
Jerry, Jerry,
this is the cable man.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.597
You know, why don't we wait...

07:25.760 --> 07:27.671
...because I'm going
out of town tomorrow...

07:27.840 --> 07:29.671
Tomorrow okay.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.150
No problem. You'll have
the whole thing installed...

07:32.320 --> 07:33.469
...by the time you get back.

07:33.640 --> 07:36.871
No, every time I turn on a TV,
sirens are gonna go off.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.395
They're gonna track me down
like a dog, I know it.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.552
Look, now, Jerry, it's no risk.
I swear.

07:42.880 --> 07:46.714
The Mets have 75 games
on cable this year.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.194
Put it in.

07:52.400 --> 07:53.594
You won't regret it.

07:53.760 --> 07:58.231
Yeah, Jerry's gonna be a cable boy
A cable boy, a cable boy

08:03.200 --> 08:05.760
- Mr. Steinfeld?
- Seinfeld.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.913
We're with the FBI. You wanna
tell us about your cable hookup?

08:09.920 --> 08:11.512
My cable hookup?
What about it?

08:11.680 --> 08:13.432
It's been illegally installed.

08:13.840 --> 08:16.274
It has? I've been out of town.
How did you know?

08:17.040 --> 08:21.591
Jerry, I had to tell them.
I had to. I had no choice.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.793
They were onto the scam
from the very beginning.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.996
You're in very serious trouble,
Mr. Steinfeld.

08:27.160 --> 08:29.879
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold on. We're just patsies.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.315
We're just a couple of users.
We never sold the stuff.

08:32.480 --> 08:35.198
What about the Russian guy?
The Russian guy's the guy you want.

08:35.360 --> 08:38.989
Mr. Seinfeld? Agent Stone,
FBI undercover.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.917
No, Jerry!

09:01.120 --> 09:02.872
No!

09:07.160 --> 09:08.832
Cable boy?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.877
Cable boy?

09:13.160 --> 09:16.311
What have you done
to my little cable boy?

09:22.880 --> 09:24.677
Excuse me, could I get
something to drink?

09:24.840 --> 09:26.558
I'm afraid not.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.555
What's with this airline?
You're cutting out the drinks?

09:31.160 --> 09:34.357
No, sir, we're flying into a blizzard.
Please fasten your seat belt.

09:34.520 --> 09:36.158
We're making an emergency landing.

09:38.840 --> 09:41.308
Are they gonna go over
the instructions again?

09:42.680 --> 09:44.875
My name is Bill.

09:45.040 --> 09:48.635
I might be the last person
you ever see.

09:55.200 --> 09:58.078
I'm not afraid of flying, although
many people do have fear of flying.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.437
And I have no argument with that.
I think fear of flying...

10:01.600 --> 10:04.956
...is quite rational,
because human beings cannot fly.

10:05.760 --> 10:10.231
Humans have fear of flying,
same way fish have fear of driving.

10:11.360 --> 10:15.592
You put a fish behind the wheel,
and they go, "This isn't right.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.836
I shouldn't be doing this.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.516
I don't belong here."

10:24.320 --> 10:25.912
- Sounds like a rough trip.
- Well...

10:26.080 --> 10:28.799
...there were fire engines and
ambulances all on the runway.

10:28.960 --> 10:32.475
And then when we landed safely,
they all seemed so disappointed.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.393
So the college cancelled the gig?

10:34.560 --> 10:36.516
There was so much snow,
the roads were closed.

10:36.680 --> 10:38.910
I really appreciate
you picking me up. Thanks again.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.839
- Forget it.
- No, really, an airport run.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.433
It's nothing.

10:43.600 --> 10:46.273
It's one thing if I asked you,
"Could you do me a favour?"

10:46.440 --> 10:47.634
But to suggest it...

10:48.160 --> 10:50.549
When you told me what
you went through on the plane...

10:50.720 --> 10:52.472
...it makes you stop and think.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.995
I appreciate having a real friend.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.116
If Richie Brandis did this,
I'd be suspicious.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.714
You know how he's always got
some ulterior motive?

11:00.560 --> 11:02.551
Ulterior motive...

11:03.520 --> 11:05.715
Wait a minute. Don't take
the bridge. Get off here.

11:05.880 --> 11:08.394
We can't go back to my place.
Elaine's having the shower.

11:08.560 --> 11:12.269
- What, tonight? Now?
- Yeah. Yeah, I forgot all about it.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.237
No big deal.
We'll go back to your place.

11:14.400 --> 11:18.029
My place? No, no. I hate my place.
I don't wanna go back to my place.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.679
Well, you wanna get a bite?

11:19.840 --> 11:23.071
Well, yeah, I would. It's just that
I just ate a whole pot roast.

11:25.440 --> 11:27.351
Well, so, what should we do?

11:28.400 --> 11:31.153
You know, shouldn't we
at least drop off your bag?

11:32.840 --> 11:36.549
Red shirt! Red shirt!
That's the red shirt!

11:36.720 --> 11:39.553
- What are you talking about?
- You're wearing the chocolate shirt!

11:39.720 --> 11:41.756
I am. What a strange coincidence.

11:42.720 --> 11:47.191
Nice try, my friend, but you gotta
get up pretty early in the morning.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.634
You gotta let me go over there.

11:48.800 --> 11:52.156
What, you're gonna badger a pregnant
woman at her own baby shower?

11:52.320 --> 11:54.914
You're gonna take it off and
make her rinse it in club soda?

11:55.080 --> 11:57.913
No. I'm gonna hold it under her nose
so she can smell the scent...

11:58.080 --> 12:00.548
...of stale Bosco that I had
to live with for three years.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.280
Then I'm gonna say, "Remember
this shirt, baby? Well, now...

12:03.440 --> 12:04.668
...it's payback time!"

12:09.200 --> 12:11.316
We just bought an apartment
on Riverside Drive.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.318
Bernard Goetz's mother
used to live there.

12:15.480 --> 12:18.552
- So where's Todd?
- Up in Hyannisport.

12:18.760 --> 12:21.832
Oh, my God, Hyannisport?
With the Kennedys?

12:22.000 --> 12:25.117
Who else is up there?
Is Rose up there?

12:25.480 --> 12:29.234
- So when's your due date?
- March 20th, 9 a.m.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.198
- You know the time?
- I'm having a planned C-section.

12:32.360 --> 12:36.035
My therapist told me if I go
through labour, I might get psychotic.

12:36.200 --> 12:39.112
Leslie, Leslie, what ever
happened to Sargent Shriver?

12:39.280 --> 12:41.999
Is he still with them? You don't hear
much about him these days.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.958
Is he, like, out of the loop, or...?

12:45.440 --> 12:48.477
Elaine, who catered this, Sears?

12:54.360 --> 12:56.430
What is this?
What are you doing here?

12:56.600 --> 12:58.238
- We're putting in the cable.
- The cable?

12:58.400 --> 13:00.595
No, I'm having a party here.
You can't do this now.

13:00.760 --> 13:03.274
Oh, we have to do this now.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.829
- Who is this guy?
- Which one?

13:06.000 --> 13:08.958
- Both of them.
- They're Soviet cable guys.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.839
Okay. Does Jerry know about this?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.275
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's all authorized. Yeah.

13:13.440 --> 13:16.512
- You can't. You can't do this now!
- Elaine...

13:16.680 --> 13:19.035
Do you know how booked up
this guy is?

13:19.200 --> 13:22.715
If I send him away now, it's gonna take
Jerry months to get him back.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.074
He won't like that.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.353
All right. Just do it fast,
and then get out.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.838
Anatole? Giddap. Go.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.632
It's only gonna take
a few minutes.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.631
Then you and the gals
can take a load off...

13:36.800 --> 13:39.075
...and watch something on Lifetime.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.794
What if we go up there,
what are you gonna say to her?

13:45.960 --> 13:48.349
- What am I gonna say?
- Yeah.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.111
"What did you go out
with me for?

13:52.280 --> 13:56.319
Just to dump chocolate on my shirt,
and then dump me altogether?

13:56.480 --> 13:58.869
I don't deserve
that kind of treatment.

13:59.360 --> 14:03.399
You don't have the common courtesy
to return my calls? To apologize?

14:03.560 --> 14:07.758
You think I'm some sort of a loser
that likes to be abused and ignored?

14:07.920 --> 14:11.356
Whose shirt can be ruined
without financial restitution?

14:11.760 --> 14:14.513
Some sort of a masochist
who enjoys being humiliated?

14:14.680 --> 14:18.514
You think you can just avoid me
like I have some disease?

14:18.680 --> 14:20.910
You have the disease!
You have the disease!

14:21.080 --> 14:23.799
You may be beautiful and
rich and physically...

14:23.960 --> 14:25.757
...just unbelievable,
but you sicken me.

14:25.920 --> 14:29.276
You disgust me.
You and everyone like you."

14:30.360 --> 14:33.272
- You'll never say that to her face.
- Watch me.

14:33.440 --> 14:38.070
Yeah, I eat the whole apple.
Core, stem, seeds, just everything.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.592
Kramer. Kramer, look at him.

14:41.760 --> 14:45.514
- Look. He's eating all the food.
- Yeah, yeah.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.636
Well, you know,
there are many differences...

14:47.800 --> 14:50.758
...between American and Soviet
cultures that you're not aware of.

14:51.520 --> 14:55.593
See, in Russia, the cable guy,
they got the whole run of the house.

14:55.760 --> 14:57.751
Yeah, that's tradition.

14:58.880 --> 15:01.394
You ever eat the bark
off of a pineapple?

15:03.520 --> 15:05.556
- Kramer! Kramer!
- Excuse me.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.348
Wow, man!

15:23.880 --> 15:26.314
What are you doing here?
I thought you were out of town.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.357
The show was cancelled.
There was a blizzard.

15:28.520 --> 15:31.671
I can't believe you told Kramer
to install cable during the shower.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.593
Jerry, look, look.
They've eaten everything.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.830
Jerry, what a surprise.
I thought you'd left town.

15:37.080 --> 15:40.470
Well, Leslie, sometimes
the road less travelled...

15:40.640 --> 15:42.198
...is less travelled for a reason.

15:45.120 --> 15:49.557
George, don't even think about it.
Don't even dream about it.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.199
- About what?
- Kramer!

16:08.440 --> 16:09.919
Leslie.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.108
Yeah?

16:12.920 --> 16:14.433
George.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.712
George Costanza.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.352
Hi.

16:25.920 --> 16:28.275
I guess you don't remember me...

16:28.440 --> 16:31.876
...but we actually went out
a couple years ago...

16:32.040 --> 16:34.998
...once. Remember?

16:35.200 --> 16:36.519
- Vaguely.
- Yeah.

16:36.680 --> 16:39.513
You took me to see one
of your shows.

16:40.640 --> 16:42.392
And?

16:42.760 --> 16:44.751
And...

16:45.280 --> 16:47.157
...it was quite good.

16:47.320 --> 16:51.711
In fact, you even incorporated me
into the show.

16:51.880 --> 16:55.668
I'm not actually a performer,
although my parents felt I had talent...

16:55.840 --> 16:57.558
Jerry?

16:57.920 --> 16:59.717
Remember me?

17:00.520 --> 17:03.830
- I'm sorry...
- Mary Contardi. No?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.877
Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry?
We had a date three years ago.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.758
You took me to one of your shows.

17:09.119 --> 17:11.509
- I think I remember.
- Told me you had a great time.

17:11.680 --> 17:14.240
- Said you'd call me the next day.
- I'm sure I meant to call.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.152
- I probably just lost your...
- Liar!

17:16.319 --> 17:17.548
Liar!

17:17.720 --> 17:19.233
You were never going to call me.

17:19.400 --> 17:22.436
You thought you could waltz through
life and never bump into me again.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.954
But you were wrong, Jerry.
You were wrong.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.275
What do you think?
I'm some poor pathetic wretch?

17:28.440 --> 17:30.749
- I didn't think that.
- To be dismissed and ignored.

17:30.920 --> 17:32.319
Some insignificant piece of dust?

17:32.480 --> 17:34.789
Some person who doesn't
deserve respect and attention?

17:34.960 --> 17:37.793
Well, you're the one who doesn't
deserve my respect and attention!

17:37.960 --> 17:40.793
You're the insignificant piece of dust!

17:48.960 --> 17:51.474
Actually, I never had
any formal training.

17:51.640 --> 17:54.757
I guess I'd be better suited
for improvs or something...

17:55.760 --> 17:57.557
Thanks a lot.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.519
Oh, bye.

18:03.920 --> 18:07.196
- Oh, I'm so sorry you have to go.
- Yeah, I really have to be going.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.678
All right, listen. I've changed my mind.
I don't want the cable.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.111
- Jerry, don't be a fool.
- You don't want?

18:13.280 --> 18:15.999
No, I don't want. Tell me what
I owe you for your trouble...

18:22.480 --> 18:23.674
Four hundred dollars.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.070
Four hundred dollars.

18:30.320 --> 18:32.151
You told me 150.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.676
Oh, well...

18:38.080 --> 18:40.150
I'm going. Obviously.

18:40.640 --> 18:44.189
Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about
everything that went on here tonight.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.554
- I had no idea...
- Elaine...

18:45.720 --> 18:48.075
...I was watching you tonight,
and I realized something.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.753
You're just like you were
in college.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.791
Thank you.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.430
What was I like in college?

18:58.680 --> 19:00.398
Come on, let's go.

19:10.280 --> 19:11.838
Be right back.

19:13.960 --> 19:18.272
I'm not paying $400.
I don't even want the thing.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.438
What are you gonna do?

19:29.040 --> 19:31.634
Every woman on the face
of the earth...

19:31.800 --> 19:34.712
...has complete control of my life...

19:35.880 --> 19:38.155
...and yet I want them all.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.797
Is that irony?

19:41.920 --> 19:44.673
Why can't I meet a Kennedy?

19:45.640 --> 19:49.030
I saw John Jr. Once downtown.
I was on a bus.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.758
I hit the...

19:50.920 --> 19:52.512
...ding.

19:53.160 --> 19:55.037
It didn't stop.

19:56.040 --> 19:59.112
All right. I said I had
a good time and I'd call...

19:59.280 --> 20:01.555
...but who takes that literally?

20:02.480 --> 20:05.597
Hey, come on over. Doctor Zhivago's
on cable in five minutes.

20:07.360 --> 20:09.430
I'm making popcorn!

20:11.800 --> 20:15.998
What do you do at the end
of a date when you know...

20:16.160 --> 20:20.472
...you don't want to see this person
ever again for the rest of your life?

20:20.640 --> 20:22.915
What do you say? What do you say?

20:23.080 --> 20:26.516
It doesn't...
No matter what you say, it's a lie.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.356
"I'll see you around.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.071
See you around.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.189
If you're around and I'm around...

20:35.800 --> 20:38.758
...l'll see you around that area.

20:39.520 --> 20:42.876
You'll be around other people,
you won't be around me...

20:43.040 --> 20:45.474
...but you will be around.

20:46.600 --> 20:48.318
Take care now."

20:48.480 --> 20:51.631
You ever say that to somebody?
"Take care now.

20:52.840 --> 20:56.230
Take care... now.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.959
Because I'm not gonna be
taking care of you...

21:00.120 --> 21:03.317
...so you should take care now."

21:03.480 --> 21:07.189
"Take care, take care."
What does that mean? "Take care."

21:07.360 --> 21:10.238
"Take off." Isn't that what
you really wanna say?

21:10.400 --> 21:12.311
"Take off now.

21:13.080 --> 21:14.832
Get out of here."
