Synch: Arrow, Breys,
Walid20-101

00:41.578 --> 00:43.935
Jack-a-fucking-nory!

00:55.664 --> 00:56.664
Smashing.

01:12.841 --> 01:14.190
See you later, yeah?

01:33.818 --> 01:36.492
<i>You're through
to Freddie's Dyslexia helpline.</i>

01:36.612 --> 01:38.130
<i>Please leave a massage.</i>

01:50.245 --> 01:51.960
Jamie Oliver. Bastard.

01:52.893 --> 01:53.993
Stephen Fry.

01:54.208 --> 01:55.208
Bastard.

01:55.693 --> 01:56.856
Nelson Mandela.

01:57.321 --> 01:59.120
Bastard. Bastard.

02:01.214 --> 02:03.890
Big, fat, ugly Irish bastard!

02:05.338 --> 02:06.778
What are you doing?

02:06.898 --> 02:09.654
I'm just looking at pictures of men,
saying which ones are bastards.

02:09.774 --> 02:10.827
Nice...

02:12.465 --> 02:13.565
Cook's gone.

02:15.406 --> 02:16.594
We broke up.

02:17.776 --> 02:20.144
Never mind, sweetheart. You OK?

02:24.505 --> 02:26.640
It's just gonna make it
really hard raising our baby.

02:49.744 --> 02:50.520
Bastard.

03:16.268 --> 03:17.869
Karen, I told you...

03:24.930 --> 03:28.592
Babe, not being funny, but you look
like microwaved shit. What's up?

03:29.241 --> 03:30.240
Nothing.

03:30.594 --> 03:34.162
My God, it's really good you're here,
actually. You can drive, right?

03:35.181 --> 03:36.520
- Why?
- Cos...

03:37.076 --> 03:39.663
Me and Freddie are having
a party tonight, in the woods...

03:40.386 --> 03:42.004
What's it called again, honey?

03:42.680 --> 03:43.635
Gobblers End.

03:44.051 --> 03:45.434
That's right. You should come!

03:45.601 --> 03:47.770
I was gonna borrow my dad's car,
but now he has to...

03:47.890 --> 03:49.611
Take Karen to an audition.

03:51.667 --> 03:52.963
We're always doing that!

03:54.032 --> 03:56.754
Maybe. I have to ask my mum
if I can borrow the car.

03:58.217 --> 04:00.311
Can we ask you something, though?

04:01.785 --> 04:04.475
Me and Freddie want this to be like,
a quiet thing,

04:05.203 --> 04:06.565
not some kind of...

04:07.201 --> 04:09.555
- What did I call it before?
- Pikey hoe-down.

04:09.943 --> 04:11.013
Thanks, babe.

04:11.660 --> 04:14.022
- So?
- So Cook's not invited.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.064
Cos we don't like him.

04:17.536 --> 04:18.565
Like I said.

04:18.978 --> 04:21.548
- I have to ask my mum.
- You just have a little think about it

04:21.668 --> 04:22.960
and let us know, yeah?

04:23.761 --> 04:25.217
I'm going to have a shower.

04:25.337 --> 04:26.627
You coming, juicy?

04:27.399 --> 04:28.875
Yeah. In a minute, hon.

04:38.653 --> 04:39.700
You should come.

04:42.329 --> 04:43.832
You want me to come?

04:48.779 --> 04:50.098
Why are you here?

04:52.906 --> 04:54.585
Came to tell you something.

05:02.674 --> 05:04.046
Your shed's changed.

05:06.123 --> 05:07.719
I'll see you later, yeah?

06:32.560 --> 06:35.320
All right? Take me to your kitchen!
Your daughter's in for a fucking treat.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.367
Four courses, real fancy shit.

06:37.487 --> 06:40.012
Pesto. Salmon. Salad.

06:40.883 --> 06:43.680
- Love, she's gone.
- OK. What time's she back?

06:44.186 --> 06:45.761
Oh, not till tomorrow.

06:46.180 --> 06:48.675
They've gone to some party
at Gobblers End.

06:51.690 --> 06:53.200
We're supposed to hang out tonight.

06:53.554 --> 06:56.165
Was that before you broke up
or after?

07:02.778 --> 07:04.421
I bought a fucking gateau.

07:07.017 --> 07:08.680
- Black Forest...
- My favourite.

07:09.426 --> 07:10.280
Cheers.

08:06.560 --> 08:09.221
Can't talk now, Mum.
Later. Later, OK?

08:19.129 --> 08:22.600
- You sure this is the right way?
- That's what the map says!

08:25.544 --> 08:27.840
- Oh, my God!
- No, we haven't...

08:28.000 --> 08:29.128
Yes, we have!

08:29.622 --> 08:31.726
Whatever! Where do we go now?

08:34.306 --> 08:36.062
Right. Turn right.

08:36.813 --> 08:39.015
- You're not indicating.
- No, that's left!

08:39.135 --> 08:42.385
- Turn right and go straight on...
- I'm sure it's left, right, Fred?

08:43.782 --> 08:45.199
What are we doing?

08:46.193 --> 08:48.119
This isn't the right way,
I told you!

09:01.907 --> 09:03.880
Stupid piece of crap.

09:04.742 --> 09:07.610
We're just gonna have
to ask someone for directions.

09:07.730 --> 09:08.730
Who?

09:10.777 --> 09:11.777
Hello?

09:13.829 --> 09:16.520
Is anybody here? For fuck's sake!

09:21.420 --> 09:22.849
Excuse me, gentlemen,

09:22.969 --> 09:25.051
could you tell me,
how to get to Gobblers End, please?

09:25.171 --> 09:28.520
I wouldn't start from here, love.
No, I reckon I could show you.

09:28.680 --> 09:30.012
- Great.
- All right.

09:30.509 --> 09:31.960
Listen to the nice man.

09:40.138 --> 09:41.200
Come on.

09:49.251 --> 09:51.927
Right. Gobblers Knob...

09:54.480 --> 09:57.000
Gobblers End, you call it...

09:57.160 --> 09:59.280
See the roundabout?
Well, go back there...

10:05.363 --> 10:06.513
Anybody here?

10:11.402 --> 10:13.693
Second on the right.
You got that?

10:14.699 --> 10:15.699
Thanks.

10:16.767 --> 10:19.274
You kids want to see something
before you go?

10:39.270 --> 10:41.200
Are you leaving
something for me, lovely?

10:43.157 --> 10:45.762
- Let me out, please.
- Cos I've got something for you.

10:46.245 --> 10:47.578
Get out of the way!

10:49.671 --> 10:51.276
Little tradition of ours.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.400
- Hang on, mate, do you really think...
- Shut up, kid.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.560
- Sweetheart, you know you want it.
- Get off!

11:08.726 --> 11:09.926
Get off of me!

11:12.542 --> 11:13.360
Help!

11:23.323 --> 11:25.202
You made me miss.

11:25.575 --> 11:27.313
- Sorry, but...
- I've never...

11:27.660 --> 11:28.665
missed...

11:28.785 --> 11:29.785
before.

11:32.649 --> 11:35.165
All right! That's it,
that's enough, leave her alone!

11:35.598 --> 11:36.598
Go.

11:40.204 --> 11:41.504
Beware the moon.

11:46.526 --> 11:47.800
Whatever. Freak!

11:54.988 --> 11:57.920
- Did you {\fucking }see the size of that gun?
- Let's get out of here.

12:03.544 --> 12:04.880
Katie, what happened?

12:05.040 --> 12:07.440
He just started shouting at me.
I didn't even do anything.

12:21.836 --> 12:23.497
Thomas, is she OK?

12:27.135 --> 12:28.520
It's them. It's them.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.160
Just stay calm.
It's probably nothing. Just chill out.

12:47.712 --> 12:49.212
What are they doing?

12:52.600 --> 12:54.680
Pull the car over. Stop the car.

12:54.840 --> 12:55.960
Stop the car now!

13:01.240 --> 13:02.759
Effy, stop the car!

13:03.482 --> 13:04.360
Wankers.

13:33.050 --> 13:34.250
Are they gone?

13:41.583 --> 13:43.240
I think we should go home.

13:44.541 --> 13:46.306
They're gone now. We're safe.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.776
As long as we, "Beware the moon".

13:49.342 --> 13:50.342
Obviously.

13:58.574 --> 14:00.452
Why are you laughing?

14:03.680 --> 14:06.200
- It's not fucking funny!
- All right, babes. Chill out.

14:06.513 --> 14:07.667
Sorry. I was...

14:12.992 --> 14:14.000
Come on.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.220
Not far now.

14:39.726 --> 14:40.956
It's so heavy.

14:42.543 --> 14:44.064
This way, right, Freds?

14:44.877 --> 14:47.240
You'll like it here, mate.
It's all right.

15:04.961 --> 15:06.635
So what's the deal with Thomas?

15:06.960 --> 15:07.887
I don't know!

15:08.319 --> 15:10.411
Cook, like, had carnal relations
with Pandora!

15:10.531 --> 15:11.863
Don't call it that.

15:12.532 --> 15:16.349
His girlfriend's a no-good hussy
and he's acting like everything's fine!

15:16.469 --> 15:17.968
It's messing with my head!

15:23.715 --> 15:25.095
How you doing, mate?

15:26.347 --> 15:28.431
Wasn't expecting to see you tonight.

15:28.958 --> 15:30.476
I mean it's great you're here.

15:30.596 --> 15:34.440
Just thought.
After what Cook said at your gig.

15:35.020 --> 15:37.978
I would like that we keep
that between us for now, yes?

15:39.200 --> 15:40.804
Course. Whatever you say.

15:44.264 --> 15:45.729
Is this the right way?

15:46.253 --> 15:47.706
That's right, sweetheart.

15:49.445 --> 15:50.591
Just up here.

18:08.654 --> 18:09.827
Are you all right?

18:11.473 --> 18:12.276
Fine!

18:15.064 --> 18:16.064
I mean,

18:17.142 --> 18:20.058
relationships just can't stay
the same, can they?

18:20.178 --> 18:23.740
Can't always be lovely and lush and
not full of weird silences all the time.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.680
People can't always be perfect
cos that's not real, is it?

18:28.757 --> 18:31.920
It's not real cos things change.
Don't they?

18:36.092 --> 18:37.092
They do.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.839
But you can tell me.

18:40.234 --> 18:42.840
If something's up, I can help you.

18:46.702 --> 18:48.089
Everything's great.

18:48.209 --> 18:50.111
I love Thomas, he loves me,

18:50.874 --> 18:53.183
everything's just
tickety-flippin-boo!

18:53.303 --> 18:54.840
OK, if you say so.

18:55.767 --> 18:57.063
Look what I found.

18:59.024 --> 19:00.156
Shroooms.

19:01.087 --> 19:02.587
Are they funny ones?

19:03.220 --> 19:04.525
What are you doing?

19:05.994 --> 19:07.760
Found some shrooms. Want some?

19:09.894 --> 19:11.981
How d'you know
they're not poisonous?

19:12.276 --> 19:15.323
I don't want you ruining
my party by, like, vomming blood!

19:16.000 --> 19:18.268
And this isn't supposed to be
that kind of party.

19:18.388 --> 19:20.388
It's just drinks and sausages.

19:20.721 --> 19:22.003
No mushrooms.

19:22.888 --> 19:23.911
Mushrooms!

19:25.938 --> 19:27.238
Who's got mushrooms?

19:29.880 --> 19:31.877
Give me some!
What? Chill out.

19:31.997 --> 19:33.360
Did I hear mushrooms?

19:34.765 --> 19:36.515
Don't you fucking dare!

19:38.056 --> 19:39.806
Don't listen to her, Ems.

19:41.846 --> 19:43.378
All part of the fun, I suppose.

19:46.683 --> 19:48.683
Come on, Panda. Live a little.

19:49.148 --> 19:51.000
No, thanks! Love is our drug!

19:52.449 --> 19:53.480
Sometimes

19:53.739 --> 19:56.141
you need a little more sugar
in your bowl, though.

20:07.355 --> 20:08.505
Go on, Panda.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.400
Don't cry.

20:28.615 --> 20:30.015
Don't fucking cry.

20:34.374 --> 20:36.120
How long till it kicks in, Eff?

20:37.374 --> 20:38.374
Not long.

21:27.579 --> 21:28.880
I am so fucked.

21:30.343 --> 21:31.612
Do I look fucked?

21:35.680 --> 21:37.715
In the shed. I just wondered...

21:38.610 --> 21:40.469
What were you gonna say?

21:42.911 --> 21:44.640
I'll tell you later.

21:49.497 --> 21:50.647
Katie's cold.

22:57.817 --> 23:01.617
Cos that's what it's about, isn't it?
Forget all that other shit,

23:02.939 --> 23:05.810
cos it's not about that,
it's about everything else.

23:06.515 --> 23:09.120
Like when you open
your eyes in the night

23:09.240 --> 23:10.951
and you see that face...

23:16.778 --> 23:18.077
Listen, Effy.

23:18.240 --> 23:20.743
I didn't even want you here{\ in the first place}
and you've ruined my night.

23:20.863 --> 23:23.179
The reason I invited you here
was because you can drive

23:23.299 --> 23:25.120
and you're embarrassing yourself.

23:25.768 --> 23:28.560
It's pretty sad. Throwing yourself
at your mates' boyfriends, really.

23:31.838 --> 23:33.840
- Come sit down.
- I'm not being nasty or anything!

23:34.702 --> 23:36.760
I don't even think
you realise you're doing it,

23:36.920 --> 23:39.501
it's just it makes you look
like a desperate whore.

24:09.959 --> 24:11.459
Who moved the stuff?

24:12.201 --> 24:13.074
What?

24:13.720 --> 24:14.886
Who moved the stuff?

24:15.977 --> 24:17.377
The bags are gone.

24:19.343 --> 24:20.720
What are you talking about?

24:25.360 --> 24:26.660
For God's sakes.

24:27.190 --> 24:30.440
- This is so not funny, guys.
- Chill out, somebody...

24:36.926 --> 24:38.376
Turn the music off!

24:45.608 --> 24:46.608
Shit!

25:00.805 --> 25:02.055
I don't like it.

25:02.318 --> 25:03.568
It's OK, Panda.

25:06.680 --> 25:09.920
Turn the lights off now. Everything off.
Quick. JJ, get that fire out!

25:12.915 --> 25:15.715
Everyone, round the fire!
Get down, get down.

26:14.867 --> 26:16.167
What the fuck...

26:16.905 --> 26:20.245
do you think you're playing at?
You fucking idiot. You nearly had...

26:24.967 --> 26:26.320
You fucking prick!

26:31.636 --> 26:34.560
- I should fucking kill you!
- You scared the shit out of us,{\ stupid} prick.

26:35.104 --> 26:36.254
It wasn't me!

26:36.946 --> 26:39.355
There were psychos
in the woods with a gun!

26:39.743 --> 26:42.560
I saw them nick your stuff so they
started shooting. They're{\ fucking} mental!

26:43.100 --> 26:44.356
Shut up. Joke's over.

26:44.476 --> 26:46.995
Bloody scared us,
you stupid fucking tosser.

26:47.115 --> 26:48.557
All right, calm down.

26:49.880 --> 26:52.171
I took your sodding
knapsacks, children.

26:52.438 --> 26:55.000
- They're just poachers, you {\daft }wankers.
- Poachers?

26:57.209 --> 26:59.309
After rabbits and shit. Not you.

27:00.021 --> 27:02.814
- I was just trying to freak you out.
- Why?

27:03.032 --> 27:05.699
Cos I thought it'd be funny!
And it totally was!

27:06.640 --> 27:09.200
Turn off the lights!
We're going to die!

27:14.479 --> 27:17.276
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- I smell a shindig, I'm there.

27:17.396 --> 27:20.196
You weren't invited
so you can just fuck off!

27:20.769 --> 27:22.780
But we're having such a nice time!

27:23.289 --> 27:26.420
Your tits look fucking mint
from this angle by the way, Kit Kat.

27:26.540 --> 27:29.790
- What is your fucking problem?
- Come on then, Rambo.

27:31.452 --> 27:33.200
What do you want? My fucking blood?

27:34.417 --> 27:37.253
Cos you've fucking taken
everything else! You've taken fucking JJ

27:37.373 --> 27:39.457
and now,
he's nicking her off me as well!

27:48.303 --> 27:49.908
She hasn't told you, has she?

27:50.028 --> 27:53.292
Fuck me,
I'm so glad I didn't miss this.

27:53.666 --> 27:54.966
What's going on?

27:58.134 --> 28:00.134
Effy doesn't want me any more.

28:02.144 --> 28:03.494
Do you, princess?

28:11.118 --> 28:12.118
So?

28:13.167 --> 28:15.572
Why should we care?
Freddie's with me now.

28:16.117 --> 28:17.367
Right, Freddie?

28:22.921 --> 28:23.680
Right.

28:29.482 --> 28:31.032
I'm going for a walk.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.088
I think she took
that pretty well, don't you?

28:41.980 --> 28:42.980
Just go!

28:43.840 --> 28:47.559
No-one wants you here!
No-one likes you! Just fucking go!

28:51.449 --> 28:52.479
Do what he says.

28:52.863 --> 28:53.863
Fuck off.

28:55.813 --> 28:56.813
Whatever.

28:59.584 --> 29:01.584
Have nice lives, all of youse.

29:03.431 --> 29:04.480
You coming?

29:06.054 --> 29:08.004
Stay here. With your friends.

29:09.626 --> 29:11.974
Look at them.
Look at their little faces.

29:13.793 --> 29:16.124
You're all such whizzo chums,
aren't you?

29:19.031 --> 29:21.317
Ain't that right, Eff?
Ain't that right, Panda?

29:22.688 --> 29:24.416
Panda's been worried lately.

29:25.338 --> 29:28.080
Says you don't see each other
as much as you used to.

29:28.565 --> 29:29.965
That right, Panda?

29:30.864 --> 29:32.564
I said to her, "Cupcake,

29:33.382 --> 29:35.861
maybe if you didn't spend as much
time with my cock in your mouth."

29:35.981 --> 29:37.781
Shut up! Come on, Thomas, let's go!

29:39.250 --> 29:40.080
It's fine.

29:41.187 --> 29:42.187
I know.

29:44.482 --> 29:45.482
Know what?

29:46.354 --> 29:47.354
Wait.

29:49.375 --> 29:51.025
It was one time, right?

29:52.240 --> 29:53.200
Your party.

29:54.972 --> 29:56.672
It was only once, right?

29:59.724 --> 30:01.078
I need to sit down.

30:07.407 --> 30:08.657
Sorry, slugger,

30:10.220 --> 30:11.751
I don't think you heard.

30:11.871 --> 30:12.871
Me...

30:13.766 --> 30:14.766
fucked...

30:15.206 --> 30:16.280
your girlfriend,

30:17.287 --> 30:18.287
like,

30:18.717 --> 30:19.967
multiple times.

30:21.517 --> 30:24.269
- What do you want me to say?
- Say nothing! Hit me.

30:27.057 --> 30:27.920
Come on!

30:29.131 --> 30:30.431
Come on, hit me!

30:32.142 --> 30:34.142
You are such a sad little boy.

30:35.731 --> 30:37.687
Thomas, please. I stopped it.

30:37.807 --> 30:40.301
- I love you. Just give me a chance.
- I have given you chances!

30:40.421 --> 30:43.299
And you have not taken them!
Time and again. You've lied to me!

30:43.419 --> 30:44.818
It's too late now!

30:45.291 --> 30:47.840
I fell in love with this girl,
she was good.

30:48.320 --> 30:49.670
She was honest...

30:50.200 --> 30:51.700
and doughnuts and...

30:52.764 --> 30:54.914
Now she is gone and this new one,

30:55.446 --> 30:56.595
I don't like her.

30:57.253 --> 30:58.934
She makes my heart hurt.

31:11.707 --> 31:14.009
Please, please, Thomas, come back.

31:24.993 --> 31:26.240
Effy, are you OK?

31:26.400 --> 31:28.981
I'm really tripping,
there's something on me.

31:31.321 --> 31:33.680
- Calm down.
- Get off me!

31:34.017 --> 31:35.467
Calm down! It's me!

32:15.156 --> 32:16.237
Who's that?

32:20.338 --> 32:21.405
Is that you?

32:22.367 --> 32:24.097
It's all right. It's me.

32:25.060 --> 32:26.397
Why are you crying?

32:28.533 --> 32:29.559
I don't know.

32:31.955 --> 32:33.035
Look at you.

32:33.155 --> 32:35.786
You're, like,
totally monged, aren't you?

32:37.579 --> 32:38.293
What?

32:38.413 --> 32:40.630
Fuck, there's loads of,
like, bugs in your hair!

32:40.750 --> 32:43.600
Where? Get them out!
Get them off me!

32:44.276 --> 32:45.620
What you doing?

32:46.138 --> 32:49.202
- The bugs! The bugs!
- What bugs? There's nothing there.

33:07.248 --> 33:09.271
Please don't take him from me.

33:09.720 --> 33:10.481
What?

33:10.601 --> 33:13.577
Freddie.
Please don't take him from me.

33:19.330 --> 33:20.576
Don't do that.

33:24.288 --> 33:26.625
Get your fucking hands off me!

33:27.608 --> 33:31.598
As if you could take him from me!
God, you're so up yourself!

33:31.760 --> 33:34.309
Your life's so shit,
you want to crap all over mine!

33:34.429 --> 33:36.737
Don't invite fucking
psychos to my party

33:36.857 --> 33:40.857
and don't push your flat little
tits in my boyfriend's face, OK?

33:41.915 --> 33:43.131
I said, OK?

33:43.759 --> 33:45.615
Cos I swear, babes, I'm serious,

33:45.752 --> 33:48.610
if you ever try and touch anything
that belongs to me ever again,

33:48.730 --> 33:50.466
I will fuck you up.

33:53.680 --> 33:54.799
I said OK?

33:55.344 --> 33:56.458
I said OK?

35:46.983 --> 35:48.369
- Hit me.
- What?

35:51.910 --> 35:52.927
Just once.

35:54.851 --> 35:56.336
I want to feel something.

35:56.707 --> 35:57.707
Hit me!

35:59.821 --> 36:00.720
I dare you.

37:25.005 --> 37:26.343
Bit cramped in there.

37:26.463 --> 37:28.853
Me, two girls
and one tent nightmare!

37:29.697 --> 37:31.839
You ladies like to wriggle,
don't you?

37:33.632 --> 37:36.015
Anyway.
I need a wee and a Tic Tac.

37:38.803 --> 37:39.803
Morning.

37:40.203 --> 37:41.353
Good morning.

37:46.252 --> 37:48.227
Anyone seen Pandora and Thomas?

37:49.400 --> 37:52.057
And where's Katie?
Thought she'd be with you, Fred.

37:53.156 --> 37:54.700
She's probably still asleep.

38:10.588 --> 38:12.782
Thomas has gone home. He's gone.

38:13.592 --> 38:15.432
I got to go now, please.

38:41.589 --> 38:42.589
Nothing.

38:43.611 --> 38:45.680
Just need to find her, OK?

39:39.531 --> 39:41.321
<i>Are you saying
you don't know where you are?</i>

39:41.441 --> 39:44.200
- No, I mean I can't find her.
- <i>Why not?</i>

39:45.315 --> 39:47.129
Because I just fucking can't, OK!

39:47.249 --> 39:49.776
- Just send an ambulance, will you?
- <i>Keep calm... Calm down.</i>

39:49.896 --> 39:53.233
I think I hit her.
No, I mean I can't find her.

39:53.503 --> 39:55.880
With a rock, and now she's...

40:01.279 --> 40:04.246
- I was tripping, I didn't mean to.
- How long does it take to have a wee?

40:04.366 --> 40:06.531
- <i>Tell me where you are.</i>
- It's Gobblers End.

40:06.651 --> 40:07.651
Coming!

41:22.293 --> 41:23.519
<i>This is Pandora.</i>

41:23.680 --> 41:26.504
<i>I can't get to the phone right now.
Please leave a message. Bye.</i>

41:26.624 --> 41:28.662
<i>You're through
to Freddie's dyslexia helpline.</i>

41:28.782 --> 41:30.852
<i>Sorry I can't take your call
right now.</i>

41:30.972 --> 41:32.971
- <i>I'm not here. Wait for the beep.
- JJ's phone.</i>

41:33.091 --> 41:36.584
<i>I can't take your call
so just leave me a message.</i>

41:37.560 --> 41:39.198
<i>Please call again later.</i>

41:44.597 --> 41:46.771
- Are you...
- <i>I should've gone with her.</i>

41:46.891 --> 41:49.235
<i>Middle of the night,
I just let her go.</i>

41:50.226 --> 41:52.403
<i>She's got nine stitches in her head.</i>

41:52.523 --> 41:54.851
<i>She was lying
in those woods all night. Alone.</i>

41:54.971 --> 41:56.665
<i>Fuck knows what happened to her.</i>

41:56.937 --> 41:58.462
<i>She's not even woken up yet.</i>

41:58.582 --> 42:00.091
But she's OK, right?

42:00.211 --> 42:01.458
She is OK?

42:01.801 --> 42:02.787
<i>I guess.</i>

42:06.372 --> 42:09.328
<i>Eff, you there? I gotta go.
I'm meeting Em at the hospital.</i>

42:09.448 --> 42:11.082
- Freddie, wait.
- <i>Call you later.</i>

42:33.241 --> 42:35.468
- She woke up, then?
- Yeah. She woke up.

42:36.380 --> 42:39.080
Fred, listen, she... pulled my hair.

42:39.241 --> 42:42.440
So what?! She pulled your hair
so you smashed her head open?

42:43.679 --> 42:45.960
It was an accident! I was tripping!

42:46.120 --> 42:47.908
She choked me, I couldn't breathe!

42:48.028 --> 42:51.720
I can't see any bruises.
I can't see nine fucking stitches!

42:53.174 --> 42:54.727
But when did it happen?

43:08.468 --> 43:11.004
Em, it was an accident. I promise.

43:11.944 --> 43:13.520
You hit her with a rock.

43:13.953 --> 43:15.760
You just left her there.

43:16.366 --> 43:18.120
She could have died.

43:20.549 --> 43:21.747
Panda, listen.

44:17.245 --> 44:18.730
Whose car is this?

44:19.237 --> 44:20.237
Dunno.

44:20.651 --> 44:23.080
But they do have a sterling
collection of power ballads.

44:26.089 --> 44:27.160
Where we going?

44:32.840 --> 44:33.990
Where are we?

45:02.056 --> 45:03.546
It's you and me, babe.

45:04.814 --> 45:06.856
It's always gonna be you and me.

45:09.530 --> 45:11.437
It's always you and me.

45:52.200 --> 45:56.080
I hope they lock that stupid girl up
when they find her.

45:56.633 --> 45:58.960
We're going shopping.
For Love Ball dresses.

45:59.120 --> 46:02.680
Come to the college ball with me.
Like we're... together.

46:02.840 --> 46:05.880
You humiliated me.
Effy doesn't even want you.

46:07.040 --> 46:08.760
But you fucking owe me, Freddy.

46:11.443 --> 46:12.489
Fuck off!

46:14.576 --> 46:16.557
We're really not shagging tonight.
