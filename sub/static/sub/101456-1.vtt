02:32.736 --> 02:34.505
Will you take me
to a love hotel?

02:37.441 --> 02:38.275
Sure.

03:05.335 --> 03:07.805
<i>I tell myself
there is no happy ending.</i>

03:11.240 --> 03:13.911
<i>All the pieces do not
fit together perfectly.</i>

03:17.281 --> 03:19.316
<i>Things are ragged and messy.</i>

04:44.019 --> 04:45.919
Good morning, Tamiko.

04:55.863 --> 04:58.266
I like your outfit.

04:58.300 --> 04:59.267
Thank you.

05:01.670 --> 05:04.205
Rockstar.

05:04.239 --> 05:07.342
Rockstar, I like
that, we have to go.

05:17.152 --> 05:19.987
Margaret, we are
waiting for you.

05:20.021 --> 05:21.289
Is everything okay?

05:23.291 --> 05:26.494
I'm fine, thank you.

05:29.464 --> 05:34.169
Hi.

06:36.164 --> 06:37.232
Hi.

06:37.265 --> 06:38.066
Hi.

06:38.099 --> 06:39.234
Hello.

06:39.267 --> 06:40.101
Hi!

06:42.970 --> 06:46.107
God, I really love this place.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.276
You keep saying that.

06:49.711 --> 06:51.012
Come by.

06:51.045 --> 06:52.113
Cheers to that!

06:52.147 --> 06:52.980
Cheers.

07:05.260 --> 07:07.829
I wonder what it's
like to be a drunk.

07:07.862 --> 07:08.696
You wonder?

07:12.133 --> 07:15.270
No, no, no, I don't mean
like a drunk, like us.

07:15.303 --> 07:17.238
I mean like a real drunk.

07:17.272 --> 07:18.907
Absolutely.

07:19.007 --> 07:22.008
If you wear a helmet
and B-pads to a bar

07:22.010 --> 07:24.412
because know you're
going to fall over,

07:24.446 --> 07:27.382
like that kind of drunk, all in.

07:27.415 --> 07:28.316
You get it?

07:28.349 --> 07:29.250
Yeah, no fucking around.

07:29.284 --> 07:31.619
No fucking around, exactly.

08:40.655 --> 08:42.624
What did I miss?

08:42.657 --> 08:44.659
Are you guys talking about me?

08:44.692 --> 08:46.995
No, no, never.

08:48.663 --> 08:50.765
Let's go find trouble.

08:54.936 --> 08:55.937
Thank you.

09:02.343 --> 09:03.912
How come you never take me

09:03.945 --> 09:05.446
to a love hotel?

09:05.480 --> 09:07.815
You know, we could,

09:07.849 --> 09:09.450
we could go half along the bell.

09:11.853 --> 09:14.122
No pressure, like.

09:34.442 --> 09:36.244
You're like a brother to me.

10:29.297 --> 10:30.765
There you are.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.001
Where did you go?

10:32.034 --> 10:33.201
Come on, I need a drink.

10:33.234 --> 10:35.570
You know, I actually,
I think I'm good.

10:35.603 --> 10:36.404
I'm going to go.

10:37.438 --> 10:38.973
Fair enough.

10:39.008 --> 10:39.907
Bye, bye!

11:21.749 --> 11:23.251
Yeah, it's nice.

11:24.919 --> 11:26.254
Get yourself.

11:31.926 --> 11:33.128
Which one do you want?

11:34.696 --> 11:36.131
This one, yeah?

11:36.964 --> 11:38.033
Okay.

11:38.067 --> 11:39.534
You like the blue?

11:39.567 --> 11:40.401
Yeah.

11:41.335 --> 11:42.837
It's good, I haven't been here.

12:20.308 --> 12:21.143
Kawaii.

12:22.643 --> 12:23.478
Cute.

12:44.832 --> 12:45.666
Here, pull.

12:48.736 --> 12:50.538
What?

12:50.571 --> 12:51.372
Pull.

12:55.943 --> 12:56.744
Okay.

13:05.154 --> 13:05.987
Pull, hard.

13:08.723 --> 13:09.557
Hard.

13:12.161 --> 13:15.730
Pull, pull.

13:18.066 --> 13:19.734
Harder, harder.

13:24.239 --> 13:25.073
Harder.

13:29.610 --> 13:30.444
I can't.

13:40.022 --> 13:40.855
I'm sorry.

13:47.562 --> 13:49.730
I want to know your mind.

13:53.868 --> 14:02.211
No, you don't.

14:16.225 --> 14:17.226
I'm sorry.

14:17.326 --> 14:20.329
Hi, sorry

14:28.170 --> 14:30.005
I think you have the flu.

14:31.173 --> 14:35.244
You should take the day
off, don't you think?

15:08.809 --> 15:12.080
I'm going to speak
bluntly, I'm sorry.

15:15.284 --> 15:17.718
Do you know why I hired you?

15:21.489 --> 15:26.261
Because nobody else applied.

15:28.896 --> 15:37.772
I hired you because
you remind me of me.

15:38.506 --> 15:39.640
That's crazy.

15:39.674 --> 15:44.379
I mean, you're
like, you're a lady.

15:47.581 --> 15:49.084
I mean that in a good way.

15:50.685 --> 15:52.187
Yes.

15:52.220 --> 15:55.623
I'm a middle-aged
lady with no husband,

15:55.656 --> 15:57.359
and no children

15:57.392 --> 16:01.729
and everyone here
thinks I'm kind of sad

16:01.762 --> 16:03.564
and strange.

16:04.433 --> 16:05.666
No, they don't.

16:07.235 --> 16:09.837
And if they do, then fuck them.

16:13.741 --> 16:16.378
But they still know
they can learn something

16:16.411 --> 16:20.982
from me and you.

16:24.186 --> 16:27.621
But you can teach
them something too.

17:56.211 --> 17:59.914
Hawkseye, do you like?

18:05.487 --> 18:07.255
Yeah, it looks like fun.

18:09.191 --> 18:15.263
No, I mean, do you like
Hawkseye, the artist?

18:16.664 --> 18:18.666
Yeah, him too.

18:28.176 --> 18:29.411
What are you looking for?

20:33.435 --> 20:34.269
My bag.

20:35.470 --> 20:36.271
My bag.

21:03.265 --> 21:06.668
How do you know that
I'm not a bad man?

21:07.602 --> 21:12.607
I don't.

21:42.337 --> 21:44.870
If I don't sleep in
the next five minutes.

21:44.872 --> 21:46.107
What?

21:46.141 --> 21:48.376
I think I'm gonna
die, don't laugh.

21:48.410 --> 21:50.578
You're gonna be fine,
you're gonna be fine.

21:50.612 --> 21:53.381
Can you help me,
please, Katrine.

21:53.415 --> 21:54.449
Well, hello.

21:54.482 --> 21:55.750
Hello!

21:55.784 --> 21:57.352
Hi.

21:57.385 --> 22:00.255
Let's get on me, three.

22:02.290 --> 22:04.125
I think someone's
been deflowered.

22:05.660 --> 22:07.462
Compliments to the lord

22:07.495 --> 22:09.997
I don't think I was
ever truly flowered.

22:10.031 --> 22:11.099
Come on, who is it?

22:12.734 --> 22:16.571
His name is Kazu and he
is the most beautiful man

22:16.604 --> 22:18.707
I have ever seen.

22:18.740 --> 22:19.907
Be careful then.

22:24.746 --> 22:27.682
All these days
have came and went,

22:27.716 --> 22:29.517
little did I know
what it's like.

22:31.119 --> 22:31.952
What?

22:48.269 --> 22:51.937
You think it's
ridiculous, I know.

22:51.939 --> 22:52.940
What?

22:53.974 --> 22:54.776
Roleplaying?

22:56.778 --> 22:59.180
I kind of like it actually,

22:59.214 --> 23:01.683
it's kind of fun to be
someone other than myself,

23:01.716 --> 23:03.151
you know?

23:03.184 --> 23:04.652
I meant the whole thing.

23:04.686 --> 23:06.287
Flight attendant school.

23:08.956 --> 23:12.327
I'm in no position
to be a snob, at all.

23:15.963 --> 23:18.299
Here, that's right, right?

23:18.333 --> 23:19.367
Yes.

23:19.401 --> 23:22.837
Just a bit over here, okay.

23:33.515 --> 23:35.784
Did you ever want
to get married?

23:37.519 --> 23:38.686
I did.

23:41.989 --> 23:44.626
But I fell in love
with the wrong man.

23:53.067 --> 23:56.171
Okay, so what
will it be today?

23:56.204 --> 23:58.673
Screaming baby, terrorist?

23:58.706 --> 23:59.507
Vegan?

24:02.277 --> 24:04.546
Oh, Mr. Pervert, very good.

24:07.782 --> 24:09.150
So you need to be strong.

24:31.606 --> 24:33.041
Konnichi wa.

24:34.542 --> 24:36.744
Yeah, I could eat.

24:36.778 --> 24:37.612
Okay.

24:45.086 --> 24:46.087
Thank you.

24:58.099 --> 24:59.501
I like this car.

24:59.534 --> 25:00.301
Yeah?

25:02.337 --> 25:03.872
I'm scared to touch anything.

25:07.408 --> 25:11.713
Don't worry, we're
just eating, talk,

25:11.746 --> 25:13.248
no funny business.

25:14.782 --> 25:15.917
No hanky panky?

25:20.154 --> 25:25.091
So, sushi, beer if you want?

25:25.093 --> 25:26.694
I want, yeah.

25:28.329 --> 25:29.631
What do you do up there?

25:32.100 --> 25:34.168
Basically it's
a group of girls

25:34.202 --> 25:36.671
that want to be
flight attendants.

25:36.704 --> 25:42.377
So I basically pronounce
English to them.

25:43.111 --> 25:46.981
So you are English teacher?

25:47.016 --> 25:51.419
Not really.

25:51.452 --> 25:55.121
More like a
pronunciation teacher.

25:55.123 --> 25:56.858
How's my pronunciation?

25:56.891 --> 25:58.426
It's good, it's really good.

25:58.459 --> 25:59.394
Good?

25:59.427 --> 26:00.695
Yeah, you could teach.

26:07.769 --> 26:11.272
Can I ask, hanky panky?

26:54.616 --> 26:55.917
Can we go somewhere else?

26:55.950 --> 26:56.784
Yes.

27:26.015 --> 27:26.914
You like?

27:26.948 --> 27:27.782
This is better.

27:37.659 --> 27:39.661
So, why Japan?

27:43.398 --> 27:44.232
To be alone.

27:47.268 --> 27:48.703
I came to Japan to be alone.

27:50.772 --> 27:53.142
Sometimes being alone
isn't about other people.

28:05.586 --> 28:07.253
Did you try this?

28:07.255 --> 28:08.057
Is it chicken?

28:09.158 --> 28:09.991
Chicken...

28:11.726 --> 28:12.527
Elbow.

28:12.560 --> 28:13.361
Elbow

28:13.394 --> 28:14.260
Chicken elbow.

28:14.262 --> 28:15.261
Chicken elbow.

28:15.263 --> 28:17.298
Chicken elbow on a stake.

28:21.369 --> 28:22.270
It's crunchy.

28:25.807 --> 28:26.708
Cartilage.

28:26.741 --> 28:28.476
Cartilage, yes.

28:34.682 --> 28:35.883
Yes.

28:35.917 --> 28:36.918
Crunchy.

28:39.520 --> 28:40.555
Sorry, sorry.

28:55.104 --> 28:56.871
Don't worry about it.

28:56.904 --> 28:57.739
Okay.

29:22.697 --> 29:23.598
Margaret.

29:49.357 --> 29:52.927
Sometimes alone
is about people.

31:13.441 --> 31:14.442
Why do you like me?

31:15.743 --> 31:16.611
You're special.

31:19.881 --> 31:21.449
How do you know?

31:23.018 --> 31:25.920
Difficult to make
you happy, I think.

31:27.755 --> 31:29.457
But I like the challenge.

31:30.591 --> 31:32.760
How about you, can
I make you happy?

31:41.636 --> 31:43.205
Again, I'm happy.

31:45.340 --> 31:47.309
I like a challenge too.

31:58.619 --> 31:59.687
I'm getting married.

32:30.052 --> 32:30.885
What?

32:37.558 --> 32:39.361
means happy and sad.

32:51.973 --> 32:52.807
Happy-sad.

32:54.909 --> 32:57.845
Yes, happy-sad.

33:04.685 --> 33:09.690
Wait, we still
have time for sleep.

33:10.558 --> 33:12.094
I'm not a napper.

33:49.331 --> 33:50.931
Do you ever clean this place?

33:53.035 --> 33:54.600
Really?

33:54.602 --> 33:55.603
Yeah, it doesn't bother me.

33:57.472 --> 34:03.378
It's like I was born
with no ability to clean,

34:03.911 --> 34:07.516
like how sociopaths are
born without a conscience.

34:16.491 --> 34:18.360
I think I'm destined to go nuts.

34:21.829 --> 34:22.763
I think it's
happening right now.

34:26.201 --> 34:27.802
I think it might be, you know,

34:27.835 --> 34:30.871
your gangster guy.

34:30.905 --> 34:32.773
Love is insanity
by another name.

34:37.645 --> 34:39.181
He said he's getting married.

34:40.082 --> 34:40.981
Oh yeah.

34:41.016 --> 34:41.816
That sucks.

34:43.385 --> 34:44.386
It sucks?

34:45.886 --> 34:46.987
It does.

34:47.022 --> 34:48.156
That's it?

34:48.190 --> 34:49.657
Is that the best you can do?

34:50.858 --> 34:51.692
I'm sorry.

34:55.430 --> 34:57.532
Do you know why the
Japanese love their fucking

34:57.566 --> 34:59.301
cherry blossom trees so much?

35:01.436 --> 35:04.705
No, it's not because
they're pink and pretty,

35:05.240 --> 35:07.309
it's because they don't last.

35:08.843 --> 35:12.447
Like everything that's
perfect and beautiful.

35:12.481 --> 35:14.815
It just doesn't last.

35:14.849 --> 35:15.950
It's not the point.

35:18.953 --> 35:21.456
Come on, take this.

35:21.490 --> 35:22.690
Look at you.

35:22.723 --> 35:24.426
You've bruises, that
doesn't look good.

35:25.527 --> 35:26.361
Come here.

35:37.972 --> 35:40.008
Enjoy the fucking ride, okay?

36:18.846 --> 36:19.880
I'm going to find my pill guy.

36:19.914 --> 36:20.748
Okay.

37:51.972 --> 37:53.874
Your individual life vest

37:53.907 --> 37:56.711
is located in a pouch
beneath your seat.

37:56.745 --> 37:59.180
Should its use become necessary,

37:59.214 --> 38:01.549
remove it from the
plastic packet.

38:01.583 --> 38:06.588
Slip it over your head and pull
downward on the front panel.

38:08.023 --> 38:11.126
Bring the straps around
your waist and insert them

38:11.159 --> 38:14.729
into the buckle
on the front hole.

38:14.763 --> 38:17.863
Pull on the loose straps
until the vest fits snugly

38:17.865 --> 38:19.567
as we are now demonstrating.

38:20.468 --> 38:22.237
As you leave the aircraft,

38:22.270 --> 38:26.675
inflate the vest by pulling
down firmly on the red tabs.

38:26.708 --> 38:29.744
The vest may be orally inflated

38:29.778 --> 38:33.014
by blowing into the inflation
tubes at shoulder level.

38:34.482 --> 38:36.184
Thank you for your attention.

38:36.217 --> 38:38.019
We will be airborne shortly.

38:50.065 --> 38:52.801
They were so good,
they were so good.

38:52.900 --> 38:53.901
They were.

38:55.103 --> 38:57.806
You were great.

38:57.905 --> 38:59.708
Thank you.

39:00.475 --> 39:02.410
I'm so proud.

39:02.444 --> 39:04.079
Me too.

39:04.112 --> 39:06.681
Do you think they're
ready for mock interviews

39:06.715 --> 39:07.782
after graduation?

39:07.816 --> 39:10.618
Yeah, yeah, of course.

40:07.041 --> 40:09.077
Have you ever cut
off someone's finger?

40:12.080 --> 40:14.082
Cutting fingers
is for apology.

40:16.151 --> 40:18.720
Like, I'm sorry,
here's my finger?

40:21.955 --> 40:26.927
Every time you look, you
remember what you've done.

40:30.732 --> 40:33.401
You know, in Japanese, we say,

40:35.737 --> 40:37.372
Not saying is the flower.

40:39.441 --> 40:41.609
What does that mean?

40:44.045 --> 40:46.047
It means shut up.

41:01.563 --> 41:03.364
My brother, Frank tried
to cut his finger off

41:03.398 --> 41:05.200
once when we were kids.

41:07.335 --> 41:09.103
He said he wanted a wound.

41:11.239 --> 41:13.408
You never say anything
about your family.

41:16.511 --> 41:19.280
I don't have a family.

41:19.314 --> 41:20.682
Everybody has a family.

41:22.217 --> 41:24.419
How about your father?

41:26.120 --> 41:26.955
Gone.

41:27.889 --> 41:28.723
Left.

41:30.358 --> 41:31.192
Ages ago.

41:35.663 --> 41:36.331
Mother?

41:38.233 --> 41:39.067
Cancer.

41:40.368 --> 41:41.202
Last year.

41:43.605 --> 41:45.607
And your brother?

41:50.445 --> 41:53.314
He hears voices in his head,

41:53.348 --> 41:54.716
telling him to do things.

42:02.690 --> 42:03.758
Do you love her?

42:11.766 --> 42:12.600
Do you?

42:19.908 --> 42:29.918
I feel like
loyalty, guilty, duty.

42:33.121 --> 42:34.355
How romantic.

42:40.128 --> 42:45.333
It's not exciting
kind of love, but love.

42:48.970 --> 42:53.741
Look, you cannot be
alone in this world,

42:54.208 --> 42:55.777
even if you want to be.

42:58.379 --> 43:00.348
You have to think
about other people,

43:00.381 --> 43:02.717
like a family,
people who become...

43:02.750 --> 43:08.456
Look, not speaking is,
what is it?

43:09.157 --> 43:11.659
I don't remember
what you've said.

43:13.328 --> 43:14.362
A flower.

43:14.395 --> 43:15.563
A flower.

43:15.597 --> 43:18.033
Not speaking is the flower.

43:19.300 --> 43:20.168
Shut up.

44:54.096 --> 44:55.030
Why this?

45:00.368 --> 45:02.336
It's the only thing
that turns me on.

45:14.565 --> 45:15.432
<i>And so it begins.</i>

45:18.187 --> 45:20.688
<i>This sore, shrieking something,</i>

45:22.790 --> 45:26.394
<i>is it nothing or everything?</i>

45:29.497 --> 45:30.531
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

45:32.867 --> 45:33.701
<i>It's yours.</i>

45:36.205 --> 45:37.039
<i>It's you.</i>

45:50.219 --> 45:52.553
Tell me about the word cunt.

45:52.587 --> 45:54.655
Well, in Scotland,
we use it all the time.

45:54.689 --> 45:55.490
Really?

45:55.523 --> 45:56.624
Yeah.

45:56.657 --> 45:57.825
I mean, in America, it's
the worst thing you can say.

45:57.859 --> 45:58.659
It's bad.

45:58.693 --> 46:00.095
Yeah, it's really bad.

46:00.129 --> 46:04.032
But over in Scotland, I
could call my friends a cunt.

46:04.066 --> 46:06.367
But honestly, you could
use it for anything.

46:09.604 --> 46:10.838
Welcome.

46:11.339 --> 46:14.842
Could you call
your mom a cunt?

46:14.876 --> 46:16.342
Definitely not.

46:16.344 --> 46:17.578
And if I called my mom a cunt,
you'd never see her again.

46:17.612 --> 46:19.514
Would you call a child a cunt?

46:19.547 --> 46:20.448
No.

46:20.481 --> 46:22.251
Oh sorry, that's ridiculous.

46:22.350 --> 46:23.651
I know, for
instance, you'd call,

46:23.684 --> 46:25.553
look at the state of that cunt.

46:25.586 --> 46:26.621
Like look at the state of you,

46:26.654 --> 46:27.555
or you made a right cunt of us,

46:27.588 --> 46:28.623
so you really fucked it up.

46:28.656 --> 46:30.358
Really Shakespearian cunt.

46:30.391 --> 46:32.227
So we have
Shakespeare to blame.

46:32.261 --> 46:33.461
I would.

46:33.494 --> 46:34.762
But if you ever
said anything...

46:34.796 --> 46:35.963
Louise.

46:35.997 --> 46:36.764
Hi.

46:36.798 --> 46:37.932
How are you?

46:37.965 --> 46:39.634
Good, I missed you.

46:39.667 --> 46:41.636
I missed you too.

46:41.669 --> 46:43.371
This place is so
cool, I love it.

46:44.906 --> 46:46.607
Louise, this is Margaret.

46:46.641 --> 46:47.708
Hi.

46:47.742 --> 46:49.211
Hi, it's so nice to meet you.

46:49.244 --> 46:52.214
Liam has told me
so much about you.

46:52.247 --> 46:57.252
That's crazy because he
has not even mentioned you.

47:03.225 --> 47:07.229
Liam tells me that
you teach English.

47:07.262 --> 47:10.299
I pronounce
English to a class.

47:13.235 --> 47:14.269
Louise is a doctor.

47:15.304 --> 47:17.705
I'm not a medical doctor,

47:17.738 --> 47:22.077
but yeah, I'm getting
my PhD in linguistics.

47:22.110 --> 47:23.644
Wow.

47:23.678 --> 47:26.581
That's crazy.

47:26.614 --> 47:28.083
This is Louise.

47:28.116 --> 47:29.951
Hi, so nice to meet you.

47:32.054 --> 47:34.856
Sorry you guys, sorry
I have to take this.

47:34.889 --> 47:39.527
Mom, hi, can you hold
on for one second.

47:39.560 --> 47:42.730
Yeah.

47:44.866 --> 47:47.202
Liam is attempting
to bring a third party

47:47.236 --> 47:49.137
into this situation.

47:49.171 --> 47:51.073
Maybe he should be convicted?

47:51.106 --> 47:52.506
Are you two jealous?

47:52.540 --> 47:54.876
No, we're really,
really happy for you,

47:54.909 --> 47:58.046
and that really smart
girl from high school.

47:58.080 --> 48:00.448
Marg, you're being a cunt.

48:01.083 --> 48:02.450
And you know you are.

48:02.483 --> 48:03.218
I'm not.

48:03.252 --> 48:04.719
Yes, you are.

48:04.752 --> 48:05.920
Oh my God, you guys, I'm
literally freaking out,

48:05.953 --> 48:09.091
my sister is, she's pregnant!

48:09.124 --> 48:14.129
Oh, congratulations!

48:16.231 --> 48:18.833
Can you imagine
having sex with Liam?

48:18.866 --> 48:22.371
He's actually kind
of sweet, look at him.

48:22.470 --> 48:25.471
We could both do worse,
we have done worse.

48:25.473 --> 48:26.308
That's true.

48:32.281 --> 48:33.848
Be nice.

48:35.483 --> 48:38.519
So, how did you two meet?

48:49.197 --> 48:50.065
Hi.

48:50.098 --> 48:50.932
Hey.

48:53.001 --> 48:54.169
This isn't much.

48:58.906 --> 49:00.675
Socks, thank you.

49:01.542 --> 49:02.977
That's so sweet.

49:04.246 --> 49:07.282
Today, we take a train.

49:07.316 --> 49:08.417
Where?

49:08.516 --> 49:09.550
Can I have your day?

49:13.921 --> 49:15.756
The whole day?

49:15.790 --> 49:16.624
Yes.

49:19.927 --> 49:21.662
Can we do it tomorrow?

49:23.165 --> 49:24.199
Has to be today.

49:34.343 --> 49:39.348
Okay.

49:58.566 --> 50:01.802
Look how good that
looks, it looks great.

50:11.213 --> 50:14.182
Is that, that's your mother.

50:14.216 --> 50:15.916
Yeah.

50:15.950 --> 50:16.784
And that's you?

50:19.054 --> 50:22.224
And that's me and my sister.

50:23.291 --> 50:24.959
Oh my God.

50:24.992 --> 50:29.730
We celebrate our ceremony,
we have this Japanese armor.

50:31.033 --> 50:33.101
Oh my God, is that your mom?

50:33.135 --> 50:35.070
She looks like a movie star.

50:35.103 --> 50:36.937
No, she's a housewife.

50:36.971 --> 50:37.872
She left?

50:37.905 --> 50:38.839
Yeah.

50:38.873 --> 50:39.707
What did your father do?

50:40.608 --> 50:41.675
Is that him?

50:41.709 --> 50:43.045
Yeah.

50:43.078 --> 50:49.051
My father is, he runs
a family business.

50:49.418 --> 50:50.218
Okay.

51:58.553 --> 52:00.055
I have another gift for you.

52:04.326 --> 52:06.394
I want to show you
a place, called

52:09.697 --> 52:10.599
Buddha's room.

52:15.470 --> 52:18.473
They say that here
you can be reborn

52:20.375 --> 52:21.976
and let go of your past.

53:29.544 --> 53:30.778
Congratulations.

53:31.779 --> 53:33.948
Congratulations on what?

53:34.815 --> 53:36.017
Today's your birthday.

53:39.688 --> 53:40.522
No, it's not.

53:42.557 --> 53:43.924
You don't feel it?

53:45.126 --> 53:46.228
Today you're born.

53:48.029 --> 53:49.497
What are you talking about?

53:54.835 --> 53:58.573
Oh, so today's
your birthday too.

54:02.810 --> 54:03.612
Yeah.

56:14.709 --> 56:17.145
I've been here
now for three years.

56:17.178 --> 56:19.980
I look forward to meeting
each and every one of you.

56:21.182 --> 56:22.817
What's your name?

56:22.851 --> 56:24.085
My name is Suzan.

56:24.119 --> 56:26.588
Hi, Suzan, nice to meet you.

56:26.621 --> 56:27.622
And you are?

56:27.655 --> 56:29.190
My name is Mao Hatakura.

56:29.224 --> 56:31.126
Hi, Mao,
nice to meet you.

56:33.061 --> 56:35.130
My name
is Saruna Takashi.

56:35.163 --> 56:40.168
Hi, Saruna,
nice to meet you.

56:55.417 --> 56:57.218
This is your final pay.

57:00.121 --> 57:01.656
I'm sorry, but I didn't.

57:01.689 --> 57:05.026
There are
consequences, Margaret.

57:05.059 --> 57:06.994
I let you down, I know.

57:07.028 --> 57:09.864
No, you let the girls down.

57:11.633 --> 57:12.767
I can do better.

57:15.003 --> 57:16.337
I know you can.

57:17.205 --> 57:18.273
But not here.

58:50.164 --> 58:51.132
I'm leaving.

58:57.939 --> 58:59.507
Now?

58:59.541 --> 59:01.576
What now, I mean,
I'm leaving Japan.

59:06.414 --> 59:08.017
You're coming back, right?

59:16.691 --> 59:19.527
Of course you're
not coming back.

59:28.636 --> 59:30.405
Everything goes away.

59:37.712 --> 59:38.880
Nothing lasts.

59:42.017 --> 59:42.850
I get it.

59:46.721 --> 59:49.223
Get enough to fucking make it.

1:00:23.758 --> 1:00:24.592
Well.

1:00:25.860 --> 1:00:27.096
That's it for me.

1:00:27.128 --> 1:00:28.030
If I have another one,

1:00:28.063 --> 1:00:29.597
they won't let me on the flight.

1:00:33.401 --> 1:00:37.872
How did you know
that I was one of you?

1:00:37.905 --> 1:00:39.340
Why didn't you give me the look?

1:00:39.374 --> 1:00:40.842
The look?

1:00:40.875 --> 1:00:41.676
Yeah.

1:00:43.244 --> 1:00:44.812
Why didn't I
give you the look,

1:00:44.846 --> 1:00:49.051
you know, because there's
two kinds of people.

1:00:51.319 --> 1:00:54.522
There's the regular people.

1:00:54.555 --> 1:00:59.527
And there's the ones that
were raised by wolves.

1:01:02.864 --> 1:01:04.499
Could you tell?

1:01:04.532 --> 1:01:05.366
Oh yeah.

1:01:06.901 --> 1:01:09.038
You came in here
howling at the Moon.

1:04:43.151 --> 1:04:43.985
Kazu.

1:04:49.091 --> 1:04:49.924
Kazu.

1:04:53.895 --> 1:04:54.729
Kazu.

1:05:02.904 --> 1:05:03.738
Kazu!

1:05:06.607 --> 1:05:07.475
Kazu!

1:05:24.059 --> 1:05:24.892
Kazu.

1:05:48.016 --> 1:05:48.849
Hi.

1:06:09.237 --> 1:06:10.538
This isn't good for you.

1:06:13.275 --> 1:06:14.443
What isn't?

1:06:14.542 --> 1:06:15.310
Me!

1:06:18.313 --> 1:06:20.449
It could be your
dirty little secret.

1:06:25.253 --> 1:06:26.088
Fine.

1:06:35.896 --> 1:06:37.999
I saw you with your family.

1:06:44.572 --> 1:06:47.708
Listen, I am in charge.

1:07:07.995 --> 1:07:09.097
I love you.

1:07:13.934 --> 1:07:14.835
I love you.

1:07:18.706 --> 1:07:20.108
Say that again.

1:07:21.842 --> 1:07:22.943
I love you.

1:07:26.014 --> 1:07:27.015
Say that again.

1:07:27.049 --> 1:07:28.616
I love you.

1:07:28.649 --> 1:07:30.052
I love you.

1:07:30.085 --> 1:07:31.019
I love you.

1:07:41.163 --> 1:07:42.097
I love you.

1:07:44.965 --> 1:07:45.900
I love you.

1:07:47.502 --> 1:07:48.437
I love you.

1:07:49.637 --> 1:07:50.638
I love you.

1:09:27.902 --> 1:09:30.804
This job isn't for everybody.

1:09:30.838 --> 1:09:32.040
Does it pay cash?

1:09:32.073 --> 1:09:33.508
Yeah.

1:09:33.542 --> 1:09:35.443
Great, when can I start?

1:10:23.458 --> 1:10:24.792
Show me your titty!

1:10:36.404 --> 1:10:37.339
I'll have one more.

1:10:41.710 --> 1:10:43.245
Hi.

1:10:43.278 --> 1:10:45.347
Is this too much for you?

1:10:45.380 --> 1:10:46.181
No.

1:10:48.283 --> 1:10:49.484
Then, please.

1:12:48.536 --> 1:12:49.437
Margaret?

1:12:51.606 --> 1:12:54.275
Hi, it's Louise.

1:12:56.311 --> 1:12:58.179
Interest in linguistics.

1:12:58.213 --> 1:12:59.114
Yes.

1:12:59.147 --> 1:12:59.945
Right.

1:12:59.947 --> 1:13:01.383
How are you?

1:13:01.416 --> 1:13:03.051
I'm good.

1:13:03.084 --> 1:13:04.085
Are you okay?

1:13:04.119 --> 1:13:04.985
I'm fine, yeah.

1:13:08.456 --> 1:13:10.325
Are you still with Liam?

1:13:10.358 --> 1:13:11.459
Liam got deported.

1:13:12.327 --> 1:13:13.361
You didn't know that?

1:13:14.729 --> 1:13:17.098
His visa ran out ages ago,

1:13:17.132 --> 1:13:18.299
but you know, Liam.

1:13:19.467 --> 1:13:21.035
But he's okay, we're
actually gonna meet up

1:13:21.069 --> 1:13:23.004
in Thailand in a month.

1:13:24.239 --> 1:13:25.971
That's really good.

1:13:25.973 --> 1:13:27.208
Tell him hi from me.

1:13:27.242 --> 1:13:28.076
I will.

1:13:31.746 --> 1:13:33.148
Can I take you to breakfast?

1:13:36.785 --> 1:13:38.186
And we do this just like,

1:13:38.219 --> 1:13:40.622
okay, not the cappuccino.

1:13:40.655 --> 1:13:43.825
Oh my God, this is literally
my version of heaven right now.

1:13:46.294 --> 1:13:47.862
Do you ever get homesick?

1:13:47.896 --> 1:13:49.030
I get bar sick.

1:13:50.131 --> 1:13:51.466
Like people really want to be,

1:13:51.499 --> 1:13:53.501
and all of a sudden
they want to be home.

1:13:53.535 --> 1:13:58.540
But I really want to
be far away from home

1:13:59.441 --> 1:14:01.242
all of a sudden and then I go.

1:14:02.577 --> 1:14:05.011
You know there's
actually a word for that.

1:14:05.013 --> 1:14:06.147
Yeah?

1:14:06.181 --> 1:14:08.016
Fernweh.

1:14:08.383 --> 1:14:15.089
Fernweh is a longing for
distance, just pure distance.

1:14:18.860 --> 1:14:22.230
Do you know what means?

1:14:22.263 --> 1:14:23.097
No.

1:14:26.034 --> 1:14:28.503
Means sobering up
by drinking more.

1:15:24.592 --> 1:15:25.426
Hey.

1:18:47.595 --> 1:18:52.201
I like to be submissive,
do you know what that means?

1:18:55.336 --> 1:18:56.671
Get undressed.

1:20:08.676 --> 1:20:13.681
Lie on the bed.

1:20:17.718 --> 1:20:18.553
Face down.

1:20:59.094 --> 1:20:59.861
Left hand.

1:22:03.491 --> 1:22:04.293
Good.

1:23:53.934 --> 1:23:57.305
It doesn't make you
special or interesting

1:23:57.339 --> 1:23:58.939
that you like this.

1:24:01.642 --> 1:24:02.477
I know.

1:24:20.462 --> 1:24:23.398
I like this
presence, the hotels.

1:24:28.636 --> 1:24:29.538
I do too.

1:24:32.074 --> 1:24:35.976
Nobody uses their public
face in these places.

1:24:38.646 --> 1:24:42.117
We shouldn't use ,

1:24:42.150 --> 1:24:43.485
the public face.

1:24:44.486 --> 1:24:45.320
The mask.

1:24:47.822 --> 1:24:52.060
When I was a kid, I
used to come here.

1:24:56.864 --> 1:24:59.468
With your girlfriend?

1:24:59.501 --> 1:25:02.370
She wasn't my girlfriend,
but she came here

1:25:02.404 --> 1:25:03.238
with me.

1:25:04.772 --> 1:25:06.807
So you got to see
her without the mask.

1:25:40.774 --> 1:25:45.779
Sometimes the mask is prettier
than the thing behind it.

1:25:53.721 --> 1:25:55.423
I could kill you now.

1:26:00.761 --> 1:26:01.762
Please do.

1:26:08.036 --> 1:26:08.869
Please do.

1:26:11.739 --> 1:26:12.574
Do it.

1:28:14.862 --> 1:28:16.864
Is this really you?

1:28:16.897 --> 1:28:17.732
Yes.

1:28:29.877 --> 1:28:31.379
You followed me.

1:28:34.082 --> 1:28:34.915
Yes.

1:28:39.953 --> 1:28:41.955
You're a coward.

1:28:48.163 --> 1:28:48.996
It's okay.

1:28:52.500 --> 1:28:53.501
It's okay.

1:29:37.479 --> 1:29:38.313
<i>Hi.</i>

1:29:40.248 --> 1:29:43.418
<i>I just wanted to say
that you're right</i>

1:29:45.220 --> 1:29:46.954
<i>about Buddha's room.</i>

1:29:49.224 --> 1:29:50.225
<i>My birthday.</i>

1:29:52.427 --> 1:29:53.595
<i>I feel it now.</i>

1:29:59.501 --> 1:30:00.435
I'm glad.

1:30:04.205 --> 1:30:05.039
Goodbye.

1:30:23.725 --> 1:30:25.493
<i>Welcome onboard.</i>

1:30:29.697 --> 1:30:32.634
<i>Your attention for the
following safety instructions.</i>

1:30:36.538 --> 1:30:39.574
<i>Secure your seatbelts
with a buckle</i>

1:30:39.607 --> 1:30:41.743
<i>to fasten the seatbelt.</i>

1:30:41.776 --> 1:30:43.745
<i>Please keep your
seatbelt fastened</i>

1:30:43.778 --> 1:30:45.480
whenever it's needed.

1:30:48.550 --> 1:30:50.885
Your individual
life vest is located

1:30:50.919 --> 1:30:53.087
in a pouch under the seat.

1:30:53.121 --> 1:30:54.322
Should its use become necessary,

1:30:54.355 --> 1:30:56.324
<i>remove it from
the plastic packet</i>

1:30:56.357 --> 1:30:57.892
<i>and put it over your head,</i>

1:30:57.926 --> 1:31:00.295
<i>and pull downward
on the front panel.</i>

1:31:00.328 --> 1:31:01.962
<i>When you leave the aircraft,</i>

1:31:01.995 --> 1:31:04.032
<i>inflate the vest by
pulling down firmly</i>

1:31:04.065 --> 1:31:05.700
<i>on the red tabs.</i>

1:31:05.733 --> 1:31:08.069
<i>The vest may be orally inflated</i>

1:31:08.102 --> 1:31:10.071
<i>by blowing into
the inflation tubes</i>

1:31:10.104 --> 1:31:11.806
<i>at shoulder level.</i>

1:31:17.111 --> 1:31:18.880
<i>Emergency exits on the aircraft</i>

1:31:18.913 --> 1:31:21.749
<i>can be found in the
safety instructions.</i>

1:31:21.783 --> 1:31:23.151
<i>Should you have any questions,</i>

1:31:23.184 --> 1:31:25.487
<i>please contact the
cabin attendant.</i>

1:31:31.059 --> 1:31:32.961
<i>Thank you for your attention,</i>

1:31:33.061 --> 1:31:35.430
<i>we will be airborne shortly.</i>

1:31:44.072 --> 1:31:46.574
<i>I tell myself
there is no happy ending.</i>

1:31:49.944 --> 1:31:52.547
<i>All the pieces do not
fit together perfectly.</i>

1:31:54.415 --> 1:31:57.585
<i>Things are ragged and messy.</i>

1:32:01.990 --> 1:32:04.659
<i>We are torn apart by events.</i>

1:32:08.696 --> 1:32:12.100
<i>Put back together
differently by others.</i>

1:32:16.304 --> 1:32:18.573
<i>But somehow everything
is beautiful.</i>
