01:33.650 --> 01:35.970
You know how blind I am without them.

01:36.236 --> 01:38.116
Howard, don't cry.

01:59.219 --> 02:02.059
Murder.

02:34.880 --> 02:37.080
- Good luck, John.
- Any contractions?

02:37.342 --> 02:39.022
Only the ones you give me.

02:53.942 --> 02:56.622
- What's coming?
- Red Ball, double homicide.

02:56.904 --> 02:59.984
One male, one female.
Killer's male, white, 40s.

03:00.282 --> 03:04.922
Agatha nailed the time at 8:04 a.m.
The twins are a little fuzzy on that.

03:05.288 --> 03:08.728
Location's still uncertain.
Remote witnesses are plugged in.

03:09.041 --> 03:11.681
This will be case number 1108.

03:16.048 --> 03:17.888
Morning, detectives.

03:19.135 --> 03:22.215
Case number 1108,
previsualized by the Pre-Cogs...

03:22.514 --> 03:24.354
...recorded on holosphere
by Precrime's Q-stacks.

03:24.599 --> 03:28.999
My fellow witnesses are Dr. Katherine
James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.

03:29.355 --> 03:30.355
Good morning.

03:30.564 --> 03:34.044
Will the witness preview and validate
1108 at this time?

03:34.360 --> 03:36.240
Affirmative. I will validate.

03:36.487 --> 03:37.887
Go get them.

03:38.197 --> 03:40.877
- Standby.
- Time of murder: 8:04 a.m.

03:41.158 --> 03:45.358
That is 24 minutes, 13 seconds
from now. This is a Red Ball.

04:11.274 --> 04:13.554
You know how blind I am without them.

04:15.444 --> 04:18.084
All right, Howard Marks,
where are you?

04:19.031 --> 04:22.552
Howard? Howard, breakfast.

04:38.385 --> 04:40.545
Four score and seven years ago...

04:40.971 --> 04:43.971
- He looked familiar.
- Who?

04:44.267 --> 04:47.187
A man standing in the park
across the street.

04:47.478 --> 04:49.678
- Seen him before.
- How can you tell?

04:49.939 --> 04:52.779
You're blind without your glasses.
Where are your glasses?

04:53.067 --> 04:55.787
- In the bedroom.
- You're running out of time.

04:56.154 --> 04:57.954
- You know how blind I am...

05:11.837 --> 05:16.077
I show eight Howard Markses in the
District. Sorting by race and age.

05:16.425 --> 05:21.065
Run their license and registration.
See if I can capture an address here.

05:23.266 --> 05:25.546
I was thinking I'd stay home today.

05:25.809 --> 05:28.649
- What about your meeting?
- I've been working too much.

05:28.938 --> 05:31.738
- Can you grab that?
- It's unclear.

05:33.859 --> 05:37.219
- Six licenses. Where do you want them?
- Over here, please.

05:58.093 --> 06:01.053
You know how blind I am without them.

06:05.393 --> 06:08.393
Got him in the Foxhall.
4421 Gainsborough.

06:08.729 --> 06:11.809
Send DCPD. Set up a perimeter.
Tell them we're en route.

06:12.108 --> 06:15.828
I was thinking maybe I'd play hooky,
stay home today.

06:16.488 --> 06:20.128
- "We've come to dedicate a portion..."
- What do you think?

06:20.451 --> 06:23.491
- What about your meeting?
- I'll reschedule.

06:23.787 --> 06:26.187
I've been working too much anyway.

06:27.291 --> 06:30.331
- "But in a larger s..." Good.
- We could have lunch together.

06:30.627 --> 06:32.907
- What do you say?
- "We cannot consecrate...

06:33.213 --> 06:36.053
- I would love to.
- "The brave men, living and dead...

06:36.342 --> 06:39.022
I have an open house
at the Ressler place.

06:39.303 --> 06:43.543
- Have consecrated, far above our
poor power to add or detract. "

06:44.017 --> 06:46.537
I guess that's why you look so nice.

06:48.312 --> 06:52.352
Chief! We got a problem
with our location.

06:56.738 --> 06:58.618
- It's no longer there.
- Shit!

06:58.865 --> 07:00.785
- Time frame?
- Thirteen minutes.

07:01.035 --> 07:02.955
Investigator from the fed's here.

07:03.203 --> 07:05.563
I don't need some twink
from the fed poking around.

07:05.831 --> 07:07.311
I wrote it on your calendar.

07:07.541 --> 07:09.861
See if the neighbors knew
where they went.

07:10.128 --> 07:11.968
- Check all relations.
- Checking.

07:12.212 --> 07:16.372
Just get him some coffee,
tell him how I save your ass every day.

07:16.801 --> 07:18.161
I got coffee, thanks.

07:18.386 --> 07:20.946
Danny Witwer,
the twink from the fed.

07:21.222 --> 07:22.982
Oops. Gum?

07:23.224 --> 07:25.624
I'll give you the full tour
some other time.

07:25.894 --> 07:29.694
They moved two weeks ago. Nobody
knows where. Still searching for family.

07:30.023 --> 07:31.663
Time horizon, 12 minutes.

07:31.984 --> 07:33.984
He's scrubbing the image, looking for...

07:34.153 --> 07:36.433
...clues as to where
the murder will happen.

07:36.696 --> 07:41.656
Original running bond brick pattern,
Georgian details. Brick was repointed.

07:42.912 --> 07:47.632
And that this nation, under God,
shall not perish from the earth.

07:48.084 --> 07:50.604
Victims are pronounced here,
killers here.

07:50.879 --> 07:55.159
Beyond that, all we have to run on
are the images that they produce.

08:05.602 --> 08:08.322
- Show a cop on horseback.
- Near the Capitol?

08:08.605 --> 08:11.165
- No Maglev system.
- The Mall?

08:12.192 --> 08:13.392
Georgetown.

08:13.652 --> 08:16.692
The Pre-Cogs can see a murder
four days out. Why the late call?

08:16.988 --> 08:21.268
A Red Ball. Crimes of passion have no
premeditation, so they show up late.

08:21.619 --> 08:25.979
Most of our scrambles are flash events.
We rarely see premeditation anymore.

08:26.332 --> 08:28.092
People have gotten the message.

08:28.334 --> 08:32.573
I show a match with Dwight Kingsley,
18th-century architect.

08:32.922 --> 08:37.162
- He did two dozen houses in D.C.
- Time horizon, 10 minutes.

08:42.682 --> 08:44.282
Look at this kid.

08:44.893 --> 08:47.453
In this one,
he's on the left side of the man.

08:47.730 --> 08:49.250
Yes. So?

08:49.481 --> 08:51.241
This one he's on the right.

09:08.418 --> 09:10.258
Merry-go-round.

09:10.879 --> 09:12.199
It's a park.

09:15.884 --> 09:19.164
There's only 16 of these old
merry-go-rounds left in the city.

09:19.471 --> 09:22.071
Two in Georgetown, one in
Barnaby Woods, the others in Woodley.

09:22.349 --> 09:24.869
It's gotta be Barnaby Woods.
Evanna, flight time?

09:25.144 --> 09:27.624
The way I drive?
Three minutes after wheels up.

09:41.202 --> 09:42.602
- Clear.
- Clear.

10:02.724 --> 10:05.444
Time horizon, six minutes.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.599
Let's go to bed.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.856
Let's do it in here.

10:47.230 --> 10:50.430
- But the bed is soft.
- I'm soft.

11:36.573 --> 11:37.933
Shit.

11:39.617 --> 11:40.977
Which one is it?

11:47.667 --> 11:50.307
- Not the bed.
- Come on.

11:50.587 --> 11:52.787
I don't want to be on the bed.

11:56.301 --> 12:00.381
- We're catching up to the future.
- Shut up, Evanna. Jad?

12:01.057 --> 12:03.217
- Jad?
- Go ahead.

12:03.476 --> 12:06.156
- Did he close the front door?
- What?

12:06.437 --> 12:08.797
Did Marks close the front door?

12:16.990 --> 12:18.350
Front door...

12:22.079 --> 12:24.439
I didn't wanna be on the bed.

12:28.919 --> 12:33.239
- Negative. The front door is open.
- Time horizon, 30 seconds.

12:40.890 --> 12:43.330
I forgot my glasses.

12:43.602 --> 12:44.682
Howard.

12:56.573 --> 12:58.693
You know how blind I am without them.

13:00.244 --> 13:02.004
Howard, don't cry.

13:02.454 --> 13:03.494
Marks!

13:22.642 --> 13:24.402
Look at me. Look at me.

13:29.399 --> 13:31.479
Positive for Howard Marks.

13:31.735 --> 13:34.855
By mandate of the District of Columbia
Precrime Division...

13:35.155 --> 13:39.195
...you're under arrest for the future
murder of Mrs. Marks and Mr. Dubin...

13:39.535 --> 13:42.895
...that was to take place today
at 0800 hours and four minutes.

13:43.205 --> 13:46.965
- I didn't do anything. Sarah?
- Give the man his hat.

13:47.293 --> 13:51.453
Oh, God.
Don't put that halo on me. Sarah!

13:51.797 --> 13:56.197
- Put your hand on your head.
- Help me! I wasn't gonna do anything!

13:56.553 --> 13:59.193
I'm Officer Scott with the
Precrime Trauma Response Unit.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.712
Sit here a minute and listen to me.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.735
Your husband is being arrested
by Precrime.

14:05.020 --> 14:07.740
Oh, God, Howard, no.

14:08.190 --> 14:12.350
Howard, don't cry.
Howard, don't cry.

14:15.280 --> 14:20.080
Please, don't cry.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

14:22.454 --> 14:24.854
I thought they stopped the murder.

14:25.416 --> 14:29.376
That's just an echo.
Pre-Cog deja vu, if you will.

14:29.713 --> 14:32.873
The really bad ones
the Pre-Cogs see over and over again.

14:33.174 --> 14:35.334
Wally, erase the incoming.

14:50.317 --> 14:53.117
Imagine a world without murder.

14:54.155 --> 14:56.115
- I lost my best friend.
- I lost my aunt.

14:56.407 --> 14:58.407
- I lost my dad.
- I lost my wife.

14:58.743 --> 15:03.183
Just six years ago, the homicide rate
had reached epidemic proportions.

15:03.706 --> 15:06.546
It seemed that only a miracle
could stop the bloodshed.

15:06.876 --> 15:10.916
But instead of one miracle, we
were given three: The Pre-Cognitives.

15:11.297 --> 15:13.977
Within just one month
under the Precrime program...

15:14.301 --> 15:17.741
...the murder rate in the District
of Columbia was reduced 90%% .

15:18.097 --> 15:20.137
- They were waiting for me.
- He was gonna rape me.

15:20.432 --> 15:22.192
- I was going to be stabbed.
- Right here.

15:22.434 --> 15:26.794
Within a year, Precrime effectively
stopped murder in our nation 's capital.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.270
In the six years of our experiment...

15:30.735 --> 15:32.975
...there hasn't been a single murder.

15:33.237 --> 15:35.357
And now Precrime can work for you.

15:35.698 --> 15:38.458
We want to make certain
that every American...

15:38.785 --> 15:41.745
...can bank on the infallibility
of the system.

15:42.205 --> 15:47.365
And to ensure that what keeps us safe
will also keep us free.

15:48.921 --> 15:50.881
- Precrime. It works.
- It works.

15:51.172 --> 15:52.492
- It works.
- It works.

15:52.716 --> 15:54.316
- It works.
- It works.

15:54.968 --> 15:57.248
Precrime. It works.

15:57.596 --> 16:02.356
On Tuesday, April 22, vote "yes"
on the National Precrime Initiative.

16:05.646 --> 16:08.846
What's the matter? Can't sleep?

16:14.197 --> 16:16.997
- Just need a little clarity.
- True that.

16:17.658 --> 16:22.258
You want the customary clarity or
the new and improved kind of clarity?

16:22.998 --> 16:24.278
Give me the new stuff.

16:24.916 --> 16:29.956
New and improved clarity.
Clarity, clarity. Yes, indeed.

16:30.714 --> 16:32.034
Come on. Come on.

16:32.299 --> 16:35.539
Don't bust my balls. You've only given
me four, and some of these are duds.

16:36.136 --> 16:37.616
Sweet dreams, chief.

16:40.682 --> 16:43.082
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

16:43.352 --> 16:45.672
I could use a little juice on my side.

16:45.939 --> 16:48.139
What do you think you know?

16:48.399 --> 16:51.039
It's like my daddy used to say:

16:51.819 --> 16:54.739
"In the land of the blind...

16:55.949 --> 17:00.149
...the one-eyed man is king. "

17:21.474 --> 17:22.795
I'm home.

17:31.402 --> 17:32.402
Overhead.

18:29.213 --> 18:30.213
Wall screen.

18:36.971 --> 18:39.211
- Sean.
- Hi, Daddy.

18:39.849 --> 18:42.049
Can you teach me how to run faster?

18:42.310 --> 18:47.150
Because all the kids in my class
run faster than me.

18:47.774 --> 18:48.854
That's good.

18:49.109 --> 18:51.269
Keep your knees up.

18:52.112 --> 18:55.032
Like that. Like that.
High. High. Like that.

18:55.699 --> 18:58.859
- See, you're a natural runner.
- Gotta keep running.

18:59.202 --> 19:01.962
Yeah. Gotta keep running.

19:02.832 --> 19:04.352
Gotta keep running.

19:05.376 --> 19:09.536
- Will I be as fast as you someday?
- Oh, I think you'll beat me someday.

19:10.089 --> 19:13.489
- You're gonna beat everybody.
- I think you'll beat everyone someday.

19:13.802 --> 19:16.962
- I gotta go. Bye.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait.

19:17.263 --> 19:19.943
- You gotta give me a kiss.
- Not on the lips.

19:20.642 --> 19:23.722
Only Mommy kisses me on the lips.

19:24.020 --> 19:25.460
Yeah, all right. All right.

19:26.106 --> 19:27.426
I love you.

19:28.025 --> 19:31.265
- I love you, Sean.
- I love you, Daddy.

20:06.523 --> 20:08.723
Reminds me of Rosarito Beach.

20:10.486 --> 20:11.726
Remember?

20:12.780 --> 20:15.140
We had 20 dollars and...

20:15.825 --> 20:19.985
Waiting in that van so the sun
would shine on our vacation.

20:22.498 --> 20:26.418
John. John. John,
put the camera down.

20:26.753 --> 20:31.713
Look, I'm all ready for bed.
What is this? No. Put it away.

20:32.092 --> 20:34.452
It's time to put the camera
to sleep...

20:34.720 --> 20:37.920
...and time to come
and take care of your wife.

20:40.517 --> 20:45.917
Why don 't you put the camera down
and come and watch the rain with me?

20:46.648 --> 20:50.248
No? I promise I'll make it
a memorable moment.

20:54.448 --> 20:57.808
Put the camera down
or you're not getting anything tonight.

21:39.538 --> 21:42.818
A gentleman at Justice
wants to take this away from us.

21:43.124 --> 21:45.804
In a week, people will vote
on whether or not...

21:46.086 --> 21:49.286
...what we've been doing has been
a noble-minded enterprise...

21:49.589 --> 21:52.829
...or a chance to change the way
this country fights crime.

21:53.218 --> 21:54.458
John...

21:55.096 --> 21:59.296
...watch this Danny Witwer,
the observer from Justice.

21:59.642 --> 22:02.442
- I met him yesterday.
- Let him look around.

22:02.728 --> 22:04.928
Answer his questions,
but watch him.

22:05.189 --> 22:07.909
If there's any problem,
make sure we know about it.

22:08.818 --> 22:12.378
When the Pre-Cogs declare a killer,
their name is embedded in the wood.

22:12.697 --> 22:17.177
Since the shape and grain of each piece
is unique, they're impossible to forge.

22:17.535 --> 22:21.135
You understand the legalistic
drawback to Precrime methodology.

22:21.456 --> 22:24.096
- Here we go again.
- I'm not with the ACLU on this...

22:24.376 --> 22:26.936
...but we arrest individuals
who've broken no law.

22:27.212 --> 22:29.772
- They will.
- The commission is metaphysics.

22:30.048 --> 22:32.688
The Pre-Cogs see the future,
and they're never wrong.

22:32.968 --> 22:34.688
But it's not the future if you stop it.

22:34.929 --> 22:38.249
- Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
- Yes.

22:38.557 --> 22:42.357
You're talking about predetermination,
which happens all the time.

22:45.440 --> 22:47.840
- Why'd you catch that?
- It was gonna fall.

22:48.109 --> 22:49.309
You're certain?

22:49.569 --> 22:51.889
But it didn't fall. You caught it.

22:53.574 --> 22:56.774
Preventing it doesn't change
the fact that it was going to happen.

22:57.077 --> 22:59.397
You ever get any false positives?

22:59.663 --> 23:04.503
Someone intends to kill, but doesn't.
How do the Pre-Cogs tell the difference?

23:04.876 --> 23:08.596
They don't see what you intend to do,
only what you will do.

23:08.923 --> 23:11.763
Why can't they see
rapes, assaults, suicides?

23:12.051 --> 23:14.011
Because of the nature of murder.

23:14.261 --> 23:17.501
Nothing's more destructive to the
metaphysical fabric that binds us...

23:17.807 --> 23:21.687
...than the untimely murder of a human.
- That wasn't Walt Whitman.

23:22.020 --> 23:26.580
Iris Hineman. She developed Pre-Cogs,
designed the system and the interface.

23:26.941 --> 23:29.741
Speaking of interfacing,
I'd love to say hello.

23:30.028 --> 23:33.308
- To Hineman?
- To them.

23:34.074 --> 23:38.394
- Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
- You've never been inside?

23:38.745 --> 23:42.025
We keep strict separation so that
no one can be accused of tampering.

23:42.333 --> 23:46.413
- I'll be the first one to go in then?
- Maybe you didn't hear me.

23:46.796 --> 23:50.476
- If it's a question of authority...
- There is no question.

23:50.799 --> 23:52.559
You don't have any.

23:53.010 --> 23:56.010
I have a warrant in my pocket
that says different.

24:07.692 --> 24:10.612
- Show it to me.
- Sure.

24:15.909 --> 24:18.629
This investigation of Precrime
and its personnel is conducted...

24:18.912 --> 24:23.352
...under the direct supervision and
permission from the attorney general.

24:23.917 --> 24:25.917
I'm here as his representative...

24:26.170 --> 24:30.090
...which means you're now operating
under my supervision.

24:34.637 --> 24:37.837
Seems you've been left
out of the loop.

24:47.526 --> 24:50.486
All right, we're ready. Let's go.

24:56.535 --> 25:00.455
- Hold it right there. Hold on.
- Not cleared for access.

25:02.041 --> 25:04.401
Eye-dent: John Anderton. Approved.

25:11.843 --> 25:13.683
- Wally.
- No, no, no, no.

25:13.928 --> 25:17.128
Danny Witwer from Justice.
We're to give him the run of the farm.

25:17.432 --> 25:19.952
- I can't touch you.
- Don't touch anything.

25:20.226 --> 25:23.386
- You can't be in here.
- Just answer his questions.

25:23.689 --> 25:26.169
- Tell me how...
- They're sleeping.

25:26.442 --> 25:29.282
Sorry. Tell me how all this works.

25:30.571 --> 25:33.331
The photon milk acts as both a
nutrient supply and conductor.

25:33.616 --> 25:37.736
It enhances the images they receive.
We call the female Agatha.

25:38.078 --> 25:42.878
The twins are Arthur and Dashiell.
We scan by way of optical tomography.

25:43.251 --> 25:46.011
White-light pinpoints pulse
along the length of the headgear...

25:46.295 --> 25:49.295
...and are reread after absorption
through their brain tissue.

25:50.217 --> 25:52.977
In other words, we see what they see.

25:54.512 --> 25:57.912
They don't feel pain. We keep
their heads stocked with dopamine.

25:58.225 --> 26:01.585
Plus, we maintain careful control
over their serotonin levels.

26:02.103 --> 26:04.783
Don't want them to drift off
into too deep a sleep.

26:05.065 --> 26:09.545
- They can't be kept too awake either.
- Don't think of them as human.

26:10.529 --> 26:13.449
No. They're much more than that.

26:15.910 --> 26:18.830
Science has stolen
most of our miracles.

26:20.707 --> 26:24.627
In a way, they give us hope,
hope of the existence of the divine.

26:24.962 --> 26:28.642
It's interesting that some people
have begun to deify the Pre-Cogs.

26:28.965 --> 26:31.125
Pre-Cogs are pattern-recognition filters.
That's all.

26:31.385 --> 26:34.345
- Yet you call this room the "temple. "
- A nickname.

26:34.638 --> 26:36.718
The oracle isn't where
the power is, anyway.

26:36.974 --> 26:41.454
The power is with the priests,
even if they had to invent the oracle.

26:43.147 --> 26:46.027
You guys are nodding like you know
what he's talking about.

26:46.567 --> 26:50.607
Well, come on, chief. The way we work,
changing destiny and all...

26:50.946 --> 26:52.946
...we're more like clergy than cops.

26:53.199 --> 26:54.759
- Jad.
- Yeah?

26:55.201 --> 26:58.441
Go to work. All of you.

27:06.671 --> 27:08.751
Sorry. Old habit.

27:09.007 --> 27:12.527
I spent three years at Fuller Seminary
before I became a cop.

27:12.845 --> 27:15.965
- My father was proud.
- What does he think of your work?

27:16.265 --> 27:20.785
I don't know. He was shot and killed
when I was 15 at our church in Dublin.

27:21.145 --> 27:23.945
I know what it's like
to lose someone close.

27:24.231 --> 27:26.391
Nothing's like the loss of a child.

27:26.651 --> 27:30.731
I don't have any children, so I can
only imagine what that was like.

27:31.072 --> 27:34.592
To lose your son
in such a public place like that...

27:34.909 --> 27:37.989
Now we can make sure that
kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone.

27:38.288 --> 27:41.888
- Tell me what it is you're looking for.
- Flaws.

27:42.375 --> 27:44.975
There hasn't been a murder
in six years. This system is...

27:45.254 --> 27:49.694
Perfect. I agree.
If there's a flaw, it's human.

27:50.342 --> 27:52.302
It always is.

27:53.220 --> 27:55.100
John.

28:37.767 --> 28:38.847
Wally.

28:44.774 --> 28:48.614
Can you see?

29:20.812 --> 29:24.292
What happened? Her ACTH levels
just shot through the roof!

29:24.607 --> 29:26.487
- What'd you do?
- She grabbed me.

29:26.735 --> 29:30.415
Impossible. They're not aware of us.
In the milk, all they see is the future.

29:30.739 --> 29:34.619
- She looked straight at me.
- It could have been a nightmare.

29:34.951 --> 29:38.071
- She spoke to me.
- To you?

29:38.372 --> 29:40.132
What'd she say?

29:40.373 --> 29:42.773
"Can you see?"

30:02.689 --> 30:04.209
You the sentry?

30:05.024 --> 30:07.664
Yes, sir, I'm Gideon.

30:07.944 --> 30:09.944
You're Chief Anderton.

30:10.781 --> 30:13.341
The music relaxes the prisoners.

30:13.617 --> 30:16.977
I don't ever see you Precops down here.
Am I in trouble?

30:17.413 --> 30:20.373
Not yet.
I'm interested in a murder.

30:20.667 --> 30:24.107
- I got plenty of those. Kill type?
- Drowning.

30:24.420 --> 30:27.220
That narrows it down.
Not too many in here for that.

30:27.507 --> 30:30.827
- Victim's Caucasian, female.
- This about the Justice Department?

30:31.135 --> 30:35.415
I'm supposed to spruce up for a tour
they got tomorrow. You like this tie?

30:35.766 --> 30:36.766
Stop.

30:40.520 --> 30:41.840
Roll back.

30:43.399 --> 30:44.639
There.

30:44.859 --> 30:50.459
She's a golden oldie. One of our first.
Probably before your time.

30:51.073 --> 30:54.993
- This is the composite of the three?
- That's right.

30:55.327 --> 30:58.247
Combined data stream
based on all three previsions.

30:58.539 --> 31:01.779
- Just show me Agatha's data stream.
- For that...

31:03.961 --> 31:05.681
...we go for a ride.

31:27.486 --> 31:29.286
My God.

31:29.655 --> 31:31.735
I'd forgotten there were so many.

31:31.991 --> 31:36.711
And to think they'd all be out there
killing people if it wasn't for you.

31:37.371 --> 31:40.171
Look at them.
Look at how peaceful they seem.

31:40.458 --> 31:44.218
But on the inside: Busy, busy, busy.

31:44.545 --> 31:48.905
Okey-pokey.
Now that is one bad man.

31:49.301 --> 31:52.661
He drowned a woman named
Anne Lively out at Roland Lake.

31:52.971 --> 31:56.651
The killer's a John Doe,
never identified.

32:12.200 --> 32:16.240
Why is he still a John Doe?
Why wasn't he ID'd from the eye scan?

32:16.579 --> 32:21.139
Those are not his eyes. He had them
swapped out to fool the scanners.

32:21.501 --> 32:25.341
You can get it done on the street
for a few thousand bucks these days.

32:25.672 --> 32:29.352
Okay, so you want
just the female prevision.

32:29.677 --> 32:31.237
That's right.

32:37.393 --> 32:40.553
We don't seem to have her data.

32:41.438 --> 32:43.078
Try again.

32:44.567 --> 32:48.047
This is odd. See?

32:48.362 --> 32:53.042
We have the two previsions. We got
what Art saw. We got what Dash saw.

32:53.410 --> 32:56.330
But Agatha's isn't here.

32:58.790 --> 33:00.270
Probably just a glitch.

33:00.500 --> 33:04.660
Tell me about the intended victim,
this Anne Lively.

33:05.213 --> 33:09.053
Looks like she's a neuroin addict,
like our John Doe here.

33:09.385 --> 33:12.225
Address history
includes the Beaton Clinic.

33:12.512 --> 33:15.592
So she cleaned up.
Where is she now?

33:17.393 --> 33:20.113
I guess glitches come in twos.

33:21.605 --> 33:26.445
You finally crawl your way out
of one hole just to fall into another.

33:31.825 --> 33:32.825
No.

33:34.244 --> 33:37.164
Can't let you take that out of here,
chief.

33:38.081 --> 33:41.721
- It's against the rules.
- Anything else against the rules?

33:47.341 --> 33:53.341
Careful, chief. You dig up the past,
all you get is dirty.

33:58.269 --> 34:01.709
The third prevision was what,
kind of fuzzy or something?

34:02.064 --> 34:06.104
No, the third prevision,
Agatha's prevision, wasn't there.

34:06.486 --> 34:11.406
That's not all. There are a dozen more
cases with missing previsions.

34:11.783 --> 34:14.902
You'd think we'd have found
the cure for the common cold.

34:15.245 --> 34:17.445
- It's stress.
- What's this?

34:17.746 --> 34:19.627
Herbal tea with honey.

34:19.917 --> 34:23.277
I hate herbal tea.
Almost as much as I hate honey.

34:23.629 --> 34:26.349
Just drink it,
before I pour it in your lap.

34:26.632 --> 34:29.391
- Can I get you anything, John?
- No, thank you.

34:29.886 --> 34:33.326
Witwer's scheduled for a tour
of Containment tomorrow.

34:33.681 --> 34:35.561
Yeah, give him a tour.

34:37.018 --> 34:39.418
- Lara called me.
- What?

34:40.147 --> 34:43.347
She's worried about you.
Quite frankly, so am I.

34:44.234 --> 34:45.514
I'm fine.

34:45.777 --> 34:49.496
I understand you've been spending
a lot of time in the Sprawl.

34:50.991 --> 34:53.871
- I go running down there.
- In the middle of the night.

34:54.661 --> 34:57.621
What if Danny Witwer
insisted on a full chem run?

34:57.956 --> 34:59.556
I'm fine.

35:01.126 --> 35:05.406
The minute Precrime goes national,
they are going to take it away.

35:05.798 --> 35:08.038
- We won't let them.
- No?

35:08.342 --> 35:12.462
How is an old man and a cop on the
whiff ever going to stop them?

35:13.348 --> 35:15.548
My father once said to me...

35:15.850 --> 35:19.850
..."You don't choose the things
you believe in. They choose you. "

35:20.188 --> 35:22.028
There's a reason you are here.

35:22.315 --> 35:27.835
Had Precrime been in place earlier,
your loss would have been prevented.

35:28.280 --> 35:29.760
Remember, the eyes...

35:32.159 --> 35:35.439
The eyes of the nation
are on us right now.

35:35.913 --> 35:38.993
I'm not the generation
anyone listens to...

35:39.333 --> 35:43.333
...but people trust you when you
speak of your belief in Precrime.

35:44.088 --> 35:48.368
They know that it's a belief born of
pain, not politics. I understood that.

35:48.718 --> 35:52.158
I may have even encouraged it
to help with the cause.

35:53.890 --> 35:57.730
But now,
your pain is hurting both of us.

36:01.899 --> 36:04.459
They're not going to take it
away from us.

36:05.569 --> 36:07.169
I won't let them.

36:37.894 --> 36:39.254
Bingo.

36:52.493 --> 36:54.253
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, buddy.

36:54.537 --> 36:56.377
- I made up a club.
- Yeah?

36:56.664 --> 37:00.144
- We're called the Crescos.
- The Crescos.

37:00.501 --> 37:02.901
- We made up a soccer team.
- Yeah?

37:03.213 --> 37:05.813
- We practice at school.
- With Connor?

37:06.133 --> 37:09.053
Your daddy's in a lot of trouble,
Sean.

37:34.203 --> 37:36.563
- Wait!
- No!

37:39.334 --> 37:41.934
Jad, how come you're not with
Father Witwer?

37:42.253 --> 37:47.773
We're in motion on something. We got a
white, male victim, about 5' 10", 170.

37:48.176 --> 37:50.656
He takes a round in the 10-ring
and goes out a window.

37:50.971 --> 37:52.691
- Red Ball?
- Nope. Brown Ball.

37:52.973 --> 37:54.133
It's premeditated.

37:54.391 --> 37:57.871
Amazing. There's someone within
200 miles still dumb enough to do that.

37:58.187 --> 37:59.667
The victim's name is Leo Crow.

37:59.939 --> 38:04.299
This is case number 1109. Time of
occurrence: Friday, 1506 hours.

38:04.693 --> 38:08.973
Start search for Leo Crow. Case 1109,
previsualized by the Pre-Cogs...

38:09.365 --> 38:12.525
...recorded on holosphere
by Precrime's Q-stacks.

38:12.868 --> 38:17.148
My fellow witnesses are Dr. Katherine
James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.

38:17.540 --> 38:18.740
Good morning.

38:19.001 --> 38:21.561
Are you ready
to preview and validate 1109?

38:21.878 --> 38:24.678
- Ready when you are, John.
- Standing by.

38:30.554 --> 38:32.274
I love this part.

38:33.390 --> 38:38.190
I've got no address. No tax returns
for the last five years.

38:38.562 --> 38:41.042
Check NCIC.
Maybe he's got a number.

38:41.983 --> 38:45.583
We'll send a protection team
as soon as we lock location.

38:48.865 --> 38:51.465
It looks like federal housing.
Concrete, glass, egg crates.

38:51.743 --> 38:54.703
Ouch. About a thousand of those
in the District.

38:56.331 --> 38:58.051
Fractured images coming in.

38:58.333 --> 39:00.613
Numbers nine...

39:03.255 --> 39:04.895
Nine, six.

39:09.553 --> 39:13.393
Female, senior. She's smoking a pipe.

39:14.392 --> 39:15.632
She's laughing.

39:19.271 --> 39:21.311
Okay, now I'm inside a room.

39:22.317 --> 39:24.957
Windowpanes, aluminum extrusion.

39:25.611 --> 39:28.651
Two figures resolving in the room.

39:29.824 --> 39:31.864
- Wait!
- No...

39:35.497 --> 39:37.617
Looks like we got a third party.

39:38.584 --> 39:41.144
Wearing sunglasses,
just out the window.

39:41.962 --> 39:43.842
You're not gonna kill me.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.067
Goodbye, Crow.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.858
You're not gonna kill me.

39:56.311 --> 39:58.231
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Wait!

40:02.192 --> 40:04.232
Wait. Wait.

40:04.820 --> 40:06.660
You say something, chief?

40:06.946 --> 40:08.106
No.

40:11.660 --> 40:13.260
I'll get this one.

40:13.787 --> 40:15.747
We got time on this one, Jad.

40:15.997 --> 40:18.837
Mind getting me a piece
of cake they're eating?

40:19.168 --> 40:20.928
- I'm starving.
- Sure, chief.

40:21.170 --> 40:23.890
I think I'll get one for myself too.

40:24.173 --> 40:25.613
Take your time.

40:42.359 --> 40:45.879
Chief Anderton,
what is this that I'm seeing?

40:46.738 --> 40:48.178
I'm confused about...

41:20.148 --> 41:22.108
- Anderton, wait!
- Goodbye, Crow.

41:22.400 --> 41:23.680
Anderton, wait!

41:25.612 --> 41:27.452
Anderton, wait!

41:33.704 --> 41:37.344
I like you, chief.
You've always been nice to me.

41:39.752 --> 41:42.632
Give you two minutes
before I hit the alarm.

41:59.148 --> 42:00.508
Hold that, please.

42:01.858 --> 42:03.058
Thanks.

42:06.405 --> 42:09.925
- You're in a lot of trouble, John.
- You set me up.

42:10.284 --> 42:13.084
I'll write the paranoia off to the
whiff you've been doping on.

42:13.412 --> 42:14.612
Easy.

42:14.872 --> 42:17.032
- Easy.
- Seems I've found a flaw.

42:19.627 --> 42:20.787
What are you gonna do?

42:21.045 --> 42:23.845
Possession will cost you six months
and your badge.

42:24.132 --> 42:26.532
I guess we won't be working together
after all.

42:26.843 --> 42:30.323
Now put the gun down, John.
I don't hear a Red Ball.

42:51.911 --> 42:53.911
Lamar. Lamar.

42:56.583 --> 42:58.863
- Lamar?
- John, what is happening?

42:59.168 --> 43:01.088
It's Witwer. He set me up!

43:01.337 --> 43:02.617
Stop, just wait.

43:02.839 --> 43:05.679
- Witwer! It's Witwer.
- Who's the victim?

43:06.009 --> 43:07.569
- Somebody.
- Who?

43:07.844 --> 43:09.764
- Somebody... Leo Crow.
- Who is he?

43:10.055 --> 43:12.695
I have no idea!
I've never heard of him.

43:13.017 --> 43:15.897
But I'm supposed to kill him
in less than 36 hours.

43:16.186 --> 43:19.346
- How could Witwer have access?
- Can you fake a cerebral output?

43:19.690 --> 43:21.250
- Why would anyone want to?
- Can you?

43:21.525 --> 43:23.765
- I doubt it.
- Would Hineman know?

43:24.028 --> 43:26.028
- Now listen, come in.
- What?

43:26.322 --> 43:28.642
I'll protect you until we
get to the bottom of this.

43:28.950 --> 43:31.870
Talk to Wally. See if Witwer's gone
inside the temple again.

43:32.203 --> 43:35.523
Ask Jad for any off-hour
eye-dents into the analytical room.

43:36.416 --> 43:38.136
Who's Leo Crow?

43:38.418 --> 43:41.098
Security lockdown enabled.
Revised destination: Office.

43:41.379 --> 43:43.979
Lamar, they found me.

43:48.512 --> 43:51.592
Is there any way to override
the lockdown?

43:51.932 --> 43:53.772
- No, no, no.
- No?

43:54.059 --> 43:57.419
I'll meet you anywhere you say.
You can come to my house, John.

43:57.771 --> 44:00.251
I can't. They'll get me.
I'm not gonna get haloed.

44:00.566 --> 44:01.646
You can't run.

44:02.651 --> 44:03.851
Everybody runs.

44:50.952 --> 44:52.792
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, hey.

45:07.469 --> 45:10.029
Oh, my gosh, are you okay?

45:13.393 --> 45:15.513
I'll bring him in. Unharmed.

45:15.811 --> 45:18.371
You're not gonna do that.
I'm taking control.

45:18.648 --> 45:19.848
What?

45:20.108 --> 45:24.348
Fletcher is second in command.
It's his show to run. You can observe.

45:24.737 --> 45:27.977
- Do it. Find him.
- Yes, sir.

45:30.119 --> 45:33.599
He came to see you the other day
right before he was tagged.

45:33.955 --> 45:36.435
- What did you talk about?
- The Mets.

45:36.750 --> 45:39.470
John doesn't think they have a deep
enough pitching roster.

45:39.795 --> 45:43.515
Why are you protecting him? You knew
he was doping, yet you did nothing.

45:43.883 --> 45:47.083
- The man lost a child, for chrissake.
- Six years ago.

45:47.428 --> 45:50.348
- What did you talk about?
- None of your business.

45:50.681 --> 45:55.001
It's my business. Investigation of a
supervising officer for a capital crime...

45:55.353 --> 45:59.313
...falls under federal jurisdiction
so as to rule out any conspiracy.

45:59.691 --> 46:02.011
- He's my suspect.
- He's my subordinate.

46:02.319 --> 46:05.799
Call the attorney general. I'm sure
he'd clarify the issue for you.

46:06.156 --> 46:09.356
I don't want John Anderton hurt.

46:11.370 --> 46:13.650
I'm going to enjoy working here.

46:16.625 --> 46:18.785
A road diverges in the desert.

46:19.462 --> 46:20.742
Lexus.

46:21.004 --> 46:24.724
The road you're on, John Anderton,
is the one less-traveled.

46:25.092 --> 46:28.092
- Make sure you...
- Diamonds...

46:30.389 --> 46:32.429
Good evening, John Anderton.

46:35.729 --> 46:39.489
John Anderton! You could use
a Guinness right about now.

46:42.152 --> 46:44.792
- John Anderton...
- Escape from it all.

46:45.113 --> 46:49.593
Get away, John Anderton.
Forget your troubles.

47:06.761 --> 47:11.041
He's been eye-dented on the Metro.
The train stops at 20th and 33rd.

47:11.432 --> 47:13.152
Send units to each location.

47:13.435 --> 47:15.155
- Better make 20th.
- Have faith.

47:56.271 --> 47:57.631
Fire them up!

48:21.840 --> 48:23.760
- Hey, Fletch.
- Hey, John.

48:24.008 --> 48:26.088
- That was a rough landing.
- Yeah.

48:26.344 --> 48:28.704
- Work on that.
- It's the shit knee of mine.

48:29.014 --> 48:30.854
- Yeah.
- Don't do it.

48:31.683 --> 48:33.443
Hey, don't do this.

48:34.269 --> 48:35.469
John?

48:35.854 --> 48:37.134
Don't run.

48:37.690 --> 48:39.650
You don't have to chase me.

48:40.317 --> 48:41.917
You don't have to run.

48:42.319 --> 48:44.119
Everybody runs, Fletch.

48:44.405 --> 48:46.325
You know we'll catch you.

48:47.408 --> 48:49.048
Everybody runs.

48:51.079 --> 48:55.039
- It doesn't have to be like this, John.
- Everybody runs.

48:55.374 --> 48:57.414
Get your sick-sticks ready.

48:58.878 --> 49:00.558
Everybody runs, Fletch.

49:01.173 --> 49:03.653
Slow down, chief. Just take it easy.

49:07.763 --> 49:09.603
No sudden moves, chief.

49:10.890 --> 49:12.810
John, it's okay.

49:13.352 --> 49:15.472
- Fletch...
- Easy does it, chief.

49:44.175 --> 49:45.375
Got a grip?

49:45.594 --> 49:47.274
- Got a grip?
- Yeah.

50:16.125 --> 50:17.485
Anderton!

50:48.701 --> 50:51.301
Go away! Get out of my kitchen!

50:51.621 --> 50:54.541
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house! Go!

50:57.669 --> 51:00.069
- Get them out of here!
- Anderton, stop!

51:00.339 --> 51:02.939
Pull him off me, Fletcher.
Get him off me.

51:04.760 --> 51:07.840
Get him out of here!
What's the matter with you?!

51:13.060 --> 51:15.180
Get out of my house! Go!

51:35.835 --> 51:39.955
By mandate of the District of Columbia,
I'm placing you under arrest for...

51:40.339 --> 51:41.619
Go to sleep.

52:02.570 --> 52:04.050
You two stay with me!

56:34.981 --> 56:36.341
Dr. Hineman.

56:37.025 --> 56:40.105
You're trespassing.
I don't have visitors.

56:45.534 --> 56:48.414
That would be from the doll's eye,
the vine...

56:48.703 --> 56:51.903
...the baneberry that scratched you
during your illegal climb over my wall.

56:52.207 --> 56:55.887
It's not a true doll's eye.
It's a little hybrid I designed.

56:56.253 --> 56:59.853
Once the poison gets into your
bloodstream, you'll start to see...

57:00.216 --> 57:04.216
...the most extraordinary display
of blue objects.

57:04.553 --> 57:07.913
This just isn't your week, is it?

57:09.559 --> 57:10.999
Chief Anderton.

57:13.479 --> 57:14.999
I'm not a killer.

57:21.112 --> 57:22.512
You better drink this.

57:22.781 --> 57:26.661
Soon you won't be able to swallow,
and then you'll be totally buggered.

57:28.078 --> 57:29.278
All of it.

57:30.080 --> 57:33.360
Okay, now take a minute
to right yourself.

57:34.876 --> 57:38.316
Just what is it you think
I can do for you?

57:40.925 --> 57:45.165
You could tell me how someone
can fake a prevision.

57:45.555 --> 57:47.435
How would I know that?

57:47.891 --> 57:50.291
Because you invented Precrime.

57:52.437 --> 57:53.957
What's so funny?

57:54.522 --> 57:59.402
If the consequences of several genetic
mistakes and science gone haywire...

57:59.777 --> 58:02.537
...can be called an invention,
then I invented Precrime.

58:02.864 --> 58:04.784
- You don't seem proud.
- I'm not.

58:05.075 --> 58:08.115
I was trying to heal them,
not turn them into something else.

58:08.412 --> 58:11.092
- Heal who?
- The innocents we use to stop the guilty.

58:11.415 --> 58:14.495
You're talking about the Pre-Cogs.

58:14.836 --> 58:19.796
You think they came from a test tube?
They are merely the ones who survived.

58:20.216 --> 58:23.856
I was doing genetic research,
treating children of drug addicts.

58:24.220 --> 58:27.700
This was 10 years ago,
when neuroin first hit the streets.

58:28.058 --> 58:33.978
It was impure, not the engineered
cocktail popular among the educated.

58:35.148 --> 58:40.668
All of these kids were born with severe
brain damage. Most died before age 12.

58:41.113 --> 58:43.713
Those few who survived,
they had a gift.

58:43.991 --> 58:47.191
I call it a gift. For them,
it was more like a cosmic joke.

58:47.537 --> 58:50.177
They would wake up in the night,
curled in the corner...

58:50.497 --> 58:52.337
...screaming, clawing at the walls.

58:52.625 --> 58:56.785
Because when these children
closed their eyes at night...

58:57.129 --> 59:01.409
...they dreamt only of murder
over and over, one after the other.

59:01.760 --> 59:05.200
It didn't take for us long to realize
that the real nightmare was...

59:05.555 --> 59:10.315
...that these dreams were about to come
true, these murders were happening.

59:14.439 --> 59:16.759
You say some of the children died?

59:17.067 --> 59:20.147
So many of them.
Despite what we did for them.

59:20.487 --> 59:24.567
Or maybe because of what we
did to them. But it doesn't matter.

59:24.950 --> 59:27.630
It's a perfect system now, isn't it?

59:28.871 --> 59:30.911
I'm not going to commit murder.

59:31.207 --> 59:33.487
I've never met the man
I'm supposed to kill.

59:33.793 --> 59:37.873
And yet a chain of events has started
that will lead you to his murder.

59:38.256 --> 59:40.936
- Not if I stay away from him.
- Can you avoid a man you've never met?

59:41.259 --> 59:44.099
- You won't help?
- I can't help you. Nobody can.

59:44.430 --> 59:47.110
The Pre-Cogs are never wrong.

59:49.601 --> 59:51.641
But occasionally...

59:52.271 --> 59:54.311
...they do disagree.

59:55.899 --> 59:57.019
What?

59:57.359 --> 01:00:01.879
Most of the time, all three Pre-Cogs
will see an event in the same way...

01:00:02.239 --> 01:00:06.039
...but once in a while, one of them will
see things differently than the others.

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:10.249
Jesus Christ.
Why didn't I know about this?

01:00:11.165 --> 01:00:14.245
Because these Minority Reports
are destroyed the instant they occur.

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:15.664
Why?

01:00:15.879 --> 01:00:20.639
For Precrime to function, there can't
be any suggestion of fallibility.

01:00:21.009 --> 01:00:24.009
Who wants a justice system
that instills doubt?

01:00:24.305 --> 01:00:27.105
It may be reasonable,
but it's still doubt.

01:00:28.642 --> 01:00:31.362
Are you saying
I've haloed innocent people?

01:00:31.645 --> 01:00:35.245
I'm saying that every so often,
those accused of a Precrime...

01:00:35.566 --> 01:00:38.046
...just might have
an alternate future.

01:00:38.319 --> 01:00:42.079
Does Burgess know about this,
about this Minority Report?

01:00:42.448 --> 01:00:45.848
I used to joke with Lamar that
we were the parents of Precrime.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.880
Parents often see their children as they
want them to be and not as they are.

01:00:51.249 --> 01:00:56.209
Answer my question: Does Lamar
Burgess know about the Minority Report?

01:00:56.588 --> 01:00:58.188
Yes, of course, he knew.

01:00:58.423 --> 01:01:03.463
But at the time, we felt their existence
was an insignificant variable.

01:01:03.846 --> 01:01:05.726
Insignificant to you, maybe.

01:01:05.972 --> 01:01:09.612
But what about those people that
I put away with alternate futures?

01:01:09.977 --> 01:01:13.497
- My God, if the country knew...
- The system would collapse.

01:01:15.691 --> 01:01:18.211
- I believe in that system.
- Do you really?

01:01:18.486 --> 01:01:20.046
You wanna bring it down.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:24.040
You will bring it down
if you manage to kill your victim.

01:01:24.367 --> 01:01:29.247
That'll be the most spectacular public
display of how Precrime didn't work.

01:01:29.623 --> 01:01:32.463
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.
- Hold that thought.

01:01:32.751 --> 01:01:36.071
- Why should I trust you?
- You shouldn't trust anyone.

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:39.500
Certainly not the attorney general,
who wants it all for himself.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.440
And not the young federal agent,
who wants your job.

01:01:42.761 --> 01:01:46.801
Not even the old man who just wants
to hang on to what he created.

01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:50.420
Don't trust anyone.
Just find the Minority Report.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.160
You said the Minority Report
is destroyed.

01:01:54.482 --> 01:01:58.042
The record is destroyed.
The original report still exists.

01:01:58.361 --> 01:02:03.401
I designed it so the report is stored
in a safe place, but not declared.

01:02:03.783 --> 01:02:05.983
What safe place is that?

01:02:06.244 --> 01:02:09.364
The safest place there is.

01:02:09.707 --> 01:02:12.547
Where is it?

01:02:14.795 --> 01:02:18.635
Inside the Pre-Cog who predicted it.

01:02:23.387 --> 01:02:27.747
All you have to do
is download it, darling.

01:02:29.518 --> 01:02:31.118
That's all, huh?

01:02:34.608 --> 01:02:37.328
Just walk into Precrime,
get into the temple...

01:02:37.610 --> 01:02:42.090
...somehow tap into these Pre-Cogs
and download this Minority Report.

01:02:42.449 --> 01:02:44.849
- If you have one.
- And then walk out.

01:02:45.118 --> 01:02:49.438
Actually, you'll have to run out.
But yes, that's what you have to do.

01:02:50.499 --> 01:02:52.459
You're insane.

01:02:53.168 --> 01:02:55.208
Or you think I am.

01:02:55.462 --> 01:03:00.462
I'll get eye-scanned a dozen times
before I get within 10 miles of Precrime.

01:03:00.843 --> 01:03:05.483
Sometimes in order to see the light,
you have to risk the dark.

01:03:05.849 --> 01:03:09.049
As a policeman...
Excuse me, as a former policeman...

01:03:09.352 --> 01:03:11.952
...I'm sure that you know
all sorts of people...

01:03:12.272 --> 01:03:15.432
...who can help you out
in this regard.

01:03:21.698 --> 01:03:24.618
It's funny how all
living organisms are alike.

01:03:24.909 --> 01:03:28.469
When the chips are down,
when the pressure is on...

01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:31.629
...every creature
on the face of the earth...

01:03:31.918 --> 01:03:35.238
...is interested in one thing
and one thing only:

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.500
Its own survival.

01:03:40.218 --> 01:03:42.298
Find the Minority Report.

01:03:47.476 --> 01:03:50.116
How do I even know which one has it?

01:03:50.395 --> 01:03:53.595
It's always in the more gifted
of the three.

01:03:55.317 --> 01:03:57.157
Which one is that?

01:04:00.197 --> 01:04:01.997
The female.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:08.720
We've got three men in a room.
The victim is here...

01:04:09.039 --> 01:04:13.079
...John is here, and this
unidentified male, at the window.

01:04:13.419 --> 01:04:17.099
The adjacent building suggests
public housing, which means...

01:04:17.423 --> 01:04:20.143
- There's thousands like this one.
- They're everywhere.

01:04:20.427 --> 01:04:23.227
But he doesn't go there to kill Crow
for another 22 hours.

01:04:23.513 --> 01:04:25.633
This is Chief Anderton's space.

01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:27.730
- He's not here.
- He'll be back.

01:04:27.976 --> 01:04:31.576
I doubt that. I'm betting
he's somewhere in the Sprawl.

01:04:31.897 --> 01:04:35.577
He's smart enough to go
where billboards can't ID him.

01:04:35.901 --> 01:04:38.181
There's fewer consumers,
which means fewer scanners.

01:04:38.445 --> 01:04:42.525
- Why won't he just run?
- Because he thinks he's innocent.

01:04:43.951 --> 01:04:45.711
We concentrate on the Sprawl.

01:04:45.953 --> 01:04:48.873
We do fly-overs in ships,
with two spyder teams on the ground.

01:04:49.165 --> 01:04:53.325
Thermal scan the entire area. Read
anything with eyes and a heartbeat.

01:05:09.353 --> 01:05:10.593
Where is she?

01:05:29.165 --> 01:05:34.925
Started blowing buttons for no reason
whatsoever, and I knew that.

01:05:38.758 --> 01:05:40.758
This damn cold.

01:05:42.012 --> 01:05:46.092
Don't worry. I could cut open your
chest and sew a dead cat in there...

01:05:46.433 --> 01:05:50.913
...you wouldn't get an infection. Not
with the antibios I'll shoot into you.

01:05:51.271 --> 01:05:52.711
That's comforting.

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:56.220
You do understand I can't just
give you new irises?

01:05:56.527 --> 01:05:57.927
Please, don't touch.

01:05:58.154 --> 01:06:01.954
Because the scanners would read the
new scar tissue, alarms will go off...

01:06:02.283 --> 01:06:04.763
...and large men with guns will appear.

01:06:07.329 --> 01:06:09.009
What was that?

01:06:09.248 --> 01:06:10.368
What was that?

01:06:10.583 --> 01:06:15.023
- It's anesthesia. It's all downhill...
- You always sneak up on your patients?

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:19.340
You wouldn't break the hand
of a violinist before the concert.

01:06:19.676 --> 01:06:21.236
Please, relax.

01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:30.929
All I'm trying to tell you is that I'll
have to remove your eyes completely.

01:06:31.313 --> 01:06:32.433
I know.

01:06:33.399 --> 01:06:37.439
- I have to replace them with new ones.
- I know. But I wanna keep the old ones.

01:06:37.779 --> 01:06:41.299
- Why?
- Because my mother gave them to me.

01:06:41.616 --> 01:06:43.896
What's it to you?
You can't resell them.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.960
Whatever you say. It's your money.

01:06:54.338 --> 01:06:58.818
Let me introduce my gorgeous
assistant, Miss Van Eyck.

01:07:19.781 --> 01:07:24.021
- This is not a lot of money.
- It's all that I could safely move.

01:07:27.122 --> 01:07:28.682
Okay.

01:07:32.544 --> 01:07:35.784
- What did you give me?
- Smile medicine.

01:07:36.089 --> 01:07:38.489
Tell you what, since we go way back...

01:07:38.759 --> 01:07:42.879
...why don't I give you my old pal
discount? What do you say?

01:07:43.222 --> 01:07:45.382
You don't remember me, do you?

01:07:45.641 --> 01:07:49.001
- We know each other?
- Yes, we do.

01:07:49.395 --> 01:07:51.275
From where? D.C.?

01:07:51.523 --> 01:07:55.923
- Baltimore. The East Side.
- Baltimore? We go way back.

01:07:56.277 --> 01:08:00.157
Solomon P. Eddie, M.D.
I was a plastic surgeon.

01:08:00.490 --> 01:08:05.530
You remember? Specialized
in burn victims, mostly women.

01:08:05.913 --> 01:08:09.433
- I put you away.
- Yeah, you did.

01:08:11.376 --> 01:08:13.536
You made those tapes.

01:08:13.796 --> 01:08:16.276
They were performance pieces.

01:08:17.674 --> 01:08:21.674
- You set your patients on fire.
- I put them out.

01:08:22.013 --> 01:08:27.173
Some not as quickly as others, but
let's change the subject, shall we?

01:08:29.145 --> 01:08:34.585
The future's so much more interesting
than the past, don't you think?

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:41.408
Miss Van Eyck.
I'm afraid she's already smitten.

01:08:42.158 --> 01:08:46.318
She only has eyes for you.

01:08:47.497 --> 01:08:51.178
I know what you're thinking, John:
How can I do what I do now?

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:56.022
Let's say that I spent an awful lot
of time in the prison library.

01:08:56.381 --> 01:09:01.381
That was a great way to avoid the more
unpleasant aspects of prison life.

01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:05.002
Confinement was
a real education, a real...

01:09:07.268 --> 01:09:08.707
...eye-opener.

01:09:13.233 --> 01:09:16.273
For true enlightenment,
there's nothing quite like...

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:19.810
...well, let's say, taking a shower
while this large fellow...

01:09:20.157 --> 01:09:23.517
...with an attitude you can't
knock down with a hammer...

01:09:23.827 --> 01:09:25.907
...whispers in your ear, "Oh, Nancy. "

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:29.683
That was a lot of fun.
Thank you for putting me there...

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.080
...and giving me the opportunity to
get to know myself so much better.

01:09:34.421 --> 01:09:36.782
And now to return the favor.

01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:51.229
- This your work?
- Yes.

01:09:52.024 --> 01:09:53.544
I like it.

01:09:53.776 --> 01:09:56.736
- How do you take your coffee?
- Cream and sugar.

01:09:57.029 --> 01:09:59.469
- I don't have any cream. Sorry.
- Just sugar then.

01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:02.020
- You and John ever come here?
- We used to.

01:10:02.285 --> 01:10:04.045
He's not here now, is he?

01:10:06.288 --> 01:10:08.048
I had to ask.

01:10:10.542 --> 01:10:13.382
- I don't have any sugar either.
- Thank you.

01:10:13.671 --> 01:10:16.511
- He hasn't tried to contact you?
- No.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.320
Did he ever mention the name
Leo Crow?

01:10:19.594 --> 01:10:22.354
No, but I don't talk
to John much anymore.

01:10:22.639 --> 01:10:26.079
- So you haven't seen his apartment.
- That was our apartment.

01:10:26.393 --> 01:10:29.233
Have you been there recently?
It's full of these.

01:10:29.521 --> 01:10:33.961
- How long has he been doping?
- Since right after we lost our son.

01:10:34.318 --> 01:10:39.558
- You mean after he lost your son.
- It was nobody's fault.

01:10:41.367 --> 01:10:45.367
But John was with him
at the public pool.

01:10:45.913 --> 01:10:48.393
You said in your divorce papers
that John tried to kill himself.

01:10:48.666 --> 01:10:51.866
- It wasn't a suicide attempt.
- What was it then?

01:10:52.169 --> 01:10:56.089
The FBI found something
that belonged to my son, a sandal.

01:10:56.424 --> 01:10:57.944
John was upset. He...

01:10:58.218 --> 01:11:01.058
He took out his gun
and watched home movies.

01:11:01.346 --> 01:11:05.466
- This is all in your statement.
- He shot a hole in the ceiling. So what?

01:11:05.809 --> 01:11:09.329
You lose your son,
let's see how well you handle it.

01:11:09.896 --> 01:11:14.776
Lamar thinks you left John because he
lost himself in Precrime instead of you.

01:11:15.486 --> 01:11:20.006
I left him because every time
I looked at him, I saw my son.

01:11:21.075 --> 01:11:25.355
Every time I got close to him,
I smelled my little boy.

01:11:25.705 --> 01:11:28.225
That's why I left him.

01:11:29.334 --> 01:11:31.454
And now you can leave.

01:11:33.504 --> 01:11:36.544
Don't take the bandages off
for 12 hours.

01:11:41.471 --> 01:11:45.591
If you take them off before then,
you'll go blind. Understand?

01:11:46.894 --> 01:11:50.734
In the fridge, there's milk.
Greta made you a sandwich.

01:11:51.065 --> 01:11:53.785
Make sure you drink a lot of water.

01:11:54.068 --> 01:11:55.988
How do I find the bathroom?

01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:59.970
The bathroom?
Now that's your right hand.

01:12:02.661 --> 01:12:05.181
The kitchen is your left.

01:12:07.498 --> 01:12:10.218
Don't scratch. Never scratch!

01:12:10.752 --> 01:12:15.232
Seeing as we're being pals, I'll give
you a bonus that may come in handy.

01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:19.790
This is a temporary paralytic enzyme.
You're gonna shoot this under your chin.

01:12:20.304 --> 01:12:23.544
- What is this?
- It'll turn your pretty face into mush.

01:12:23.849 --> 01:12:26.169
People won't even recognize you.

01:12:26.435 --> 01:12:30.595
In 30 minutes, it'll tighten up again.
But it'll hurt like you've never felt.

01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:34.780
I'm gonna put this in your goody-bag,
together with your...

01:12:35.153 --> 01:12:36.913
...leftovers.

01:12:38.656 --> 01:12:44.096
I'm setting up a timer. When it rings,
you can remove the bandages and leave.

01:12:44.496 --> 01:12:48.296
- But not before then, or you will...
- Go blind. I know.

01:12:48.625 --> 01:12:50.465
Don't scratch.

01:12:51.503 --> 01:12:56.063
A little something from
a mutual friend of ours.

01:13:32.963 --> 01:13:35.443
Don 't take the bandages off
for 12 hours.

01:13:36.508 --> 01:13:41.068
If you take them off before then,
you'll go blind. Understand?

01:14:01.952 --> 01:14:06.552
- 25. 16 seconds. That's a new record.
- Is that a world record?

01:14:06.915 --> 01:14:10.275
Is it a world record?
It's a personal best.

01:14:10.586 --> 01:14:13.506
- Now I wanna time you.
- You gotta be kidding.

01:14:13.798 --> 01:14:16.638
There's no way
I can beat 25. 16 seconds.

01:14:16.926 --> 01:14:19.646
How long can a whale hold its breath?

01:14:19.929 --> 01:14:22.009
For about 20 minutes.

01:14:22.265 --> 01:14:25.465
- So we gotta beat the whale.
- Okay.

01:14:27.312 --> 01:14:29.632
We gotta beat the whale.

01:14:30.357 --> 01:14:31.637
Here you go.

01:14:31.858 --> 01:14:35.578
It's gonna be 20 minutes. You sure
you don't wanna go for an ice cream?

01:14:35.904 --> 01:14:38.784
Because you know
I'm gonna beat that whale.

01:14:39.324 --> 01:14:40.884
- Ready?
- Give me the count.

01:14:41.118 --> 01:14:43.278
Three, two, one, go!

01:15:01.097 --> 01:15:02.537
Sean?

01:15:05.393 --> 01:15:06.553
Sean?

01:15:09.564 --> 01:15:10.844
Sean.

01:15:17.406 --> 01:15:19.086
Have you seen...?

01:15:20.701 --> 01:15:25.021
I'm looking for my son. Have you
seen a boy in a red bathing suit?

01:15:26.874 --> 01:15:30.234
You seen my boy?
He's wearing a red bathing suit.

01:17:18.449 --> 01:17:23.169
Jad, we're ready to begin thermal scan
on all residences on North Powell.

01:17:24.414 --> 01:17:26.814
You must really like me, don't you?

01:17:27.083 --> 01:17:29.843
That's why you asked to partner
with me on this sortie.

01:17:30.128 --> 01:17:31.528
You're swell company.

01:17:31.754 --> 01:17:34.914
It's not that you don't trust me
to be alone with the chief, is it?

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:37.377
That you think I might, you know,
futz with him?

01:17:37.635 --> 01:17:41.355
No, I just wanna watch him use your
body to sandblast another building.

01:17:41.682 --> 01:17:42.682
Evanna, go.

01:17:43.184 --> 01:17:46.464
I show 27 warm bodies.

01:17:46.770 --> 01:17:49.490
Roger that. Confirmed, 27 warm bodies.

01:17:49.774 --> 01:17:54.534
- Four spyders, one per floor?
- Let's do eight. I gotta eat.

01:18:10.128 --> 01:18:15.128
Residents of 931 Powell, this is
Officer Fletcher of D.C. Precrime.

01:18:15.509 --> 01:18:20.589
Under authority of P.C. section 6409, we
are deploying spyders into your complex.

01:18:22.016 --> 01:18:24.296
Mom, I'm scared.

01:18:24.602 --> 01:18:27.002
Mommy, I'm scared. Mommy.

01:18:27.271 --> 01:18:31.071
That's gonna scan you.
Keep your eyes open. Stay still.

01:18:31.401 --> 01:18:33.161
- It's okay.
- I don't like it.

01:18:33.403 --> 01:18:35.403
Stay still. Stay still.

01:18:59.012 --> 01:19:00.132
Come on!

01:19:00.347 --> 01:19:02.827
You stepped out on me
for the last time.

01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:04.620
I told you where I was.

01:19:04.852 --> 01:19:07.652
You're a no-good liar.
I know you was with that ho.

01:19:07.938 --> 01:19:09.498
You're lucky we...

01:19:13.778 --> 01:19:15.778
Leave me alone!

01:20:32.194 --> 01:20:33.674
We lost one.

01:20:34.071 --> 01:20:37.871
Roger that. Maybe it was
a cat jumping through a window.

01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:40.050
It's an awful big cat.

01:20:40.285 --> 01:20:41.605
Fletcher.

01:20:42.663 --> 01:20:44.543
I'll go check it out.

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:26.320
They're crying their eyes out.
You terrified them.

01:21:26.625 --> 01:21:28.745
Keep your kids away from me.

01:21:44.185 --> 01:21:48.385
The big cat's back. What do you think?
A drunk, maybe can't wake up?

01:21:48.732 --> 01:21:51.252
Or a guy who doesn't want to get read.

01:21:51.526 --> 01:21:54.006
Folks, be quiet, go back inside.

01:22:04.999 --> 01:22:07.119
Be quiet and close the door.

01:22:14.258 --> 01:22:16.458
We got an ID. It's not him.

01:22:18.472 --> 01:22:21.232
- Standing down.
- Let's eat.

01:22:34.739 --> 01:22:37.419
Fletcher, take a look.

01:22:39.201 --> 01:22:42.281
There's four people in this room,
not three.

01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:45.940
Four? There's Anderton, Crow
and the man in sunglasses.

01:22:46.251 --> 01:22:49.411
The man in the sunglasses
is outside the window.

01:22:52.007 --> 01:22:56.487
There's also someone here
in the mirror.

01:22:57.345 --> 01:22:59.385
Definitely female.

01:22:59.932 --> 01:23:04.012
The Precrime program began in 2046
with a federal grant.

01:23:04.353 --> 01:23:09.393
And now, nine years later,
D.C. is the safest city in America.

01:23:09.776 --> 01:23:12.056
Why? Because Precrime works.

01:23:12.319 --> 01:23:15.439
Precrime has eliminated the need
for conventional detectives.

01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:20.380
What happens now is the verification
and protection of future victims.

01:23:20.745 --> 01:23:22.305
Can we see the Pre-Cogs?

01:23:22.539 --> 01:23:26.859
They have such a powerful gift,
they're kept in peaceful seclusion...

01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:29.130
...so as not to be distracted.

01:23:29.379 --> 01:23:33.699
This display should give you some idea
of what their daily life is like.

01:23:34.635 --> 01:23:38.315
The Pre-Cogs get over
8 million letters every year.

01:23:38.639 --> 01:23:40.559
That's more than Santa Claus gets.

01:23:40.808 --> 01:23:44.328
Each Pre-Cog has their own bedroom,
TV and weight room.

01:23:44.645 --> 01:23:46.725
It's wonderful to be a Pre-Cog.

01:24:12.174 --> 01:24:14.654
My mom's new boyfriend
came over again last night.

01:24:14.969 --> 01:24:17.129
He's just not very intelligent.

01:24:17.387 --> 01:24:22.987
My mom wouldn't let me eat upstairs.
I had to listen to him go on and on.

01:24:31.945 --> 01:24:33.625
Shit!

01:24:51.548 --> 01:24:54.268
Eye-dent: John Anderton.
Approved for entry.

01:24:58.472 --> 01:25:02.232
- Which I told her I'd be able to do.
I'm so good at taking care of you.

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:06.920
But she thinks I'll be irresponsible.
It's ridiculous because...

01:25:09.609 --> 01:25:13.249
You can't be in here.
What are you doing here?

01:25:17.868 --> 01:25:20.588
Easy there, old-timer.
Who cleared you?

01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:22.830
- You're not allowed here.
- Listen, Wally.

01:25:23.081 --> 01:25:24.761
- Do I know you?
- I like you.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.960
So I don't wanna have
to kick you or hit you.

01:25:28.254 --> 01:25:30.654
But only if you promise to help me.

01:25:31.924 --> 01:25:33.764
Hi, John.

01:25:42.185 --> 01:25:44.505
Who does that look like to you?

01:25:46.105 --> 01:25:47.785
I don't know.

01:25:51.695 --> 01:25:55.815
It's Agatha.
He's coming here to get her.

01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:02.160
- Are these all of her previsions?
- I'm rewinding her right now.

01:26:04.124 --> 01:26:06.404
Just take me to the Leo Crow murder.

01:26:06.669 --> 01:26:10.909
They don't come out in any order.
I'm getting them as she's giving them.

01:26:14.177 --> 01:26:15.937
Can you see?

01:26:29.442 --> 01:26:32.162
- He's inside.
- He has some kind of mask on.

01:26:32.446 --> 01:26:34.326
- He sealed the door.
- Shit!

01:26:34.572 --> 01:26:37.372
Nobody fires a weapon inside
the temple. Use bindfoam.

01:26:37.659 --> 01:26:40.979
- Is there another way out of there?
- All the doors are covered.

01:26:41.289 --> 01:26:46.689
John, move away from the tank.
Move away from the tank, John.

01:27:04.104 --> 01:27:05.944
What does he want with a Pre-Cog?

01:27:06.190 --> 01:27:09.270
So he can kill whoever he wants to
without anyone knowing.

01:27:09.568 --> 01:27:14.608
Well, there's still the other two.
The other two can still function, right?

01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:21.030
They're a hive mind. It takes all three
for their predictive abilities to work.

01:27:23.415 --> 01:27:25.255
They can't see murders anymore?

01:27:25.501 --> 01:27:29.181
Agatha, she's the key.
She's the one they listen to...

01:27:29.506 --> 01:27:31.626
...the one with the most talent.

01:27:31.883 --> 01:27:35.163
- She takes care of the other two.
- Jesus.

01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:39.390
- Please bring her back.
- Every team underground, now!

01:27:39.724 --> 01:27:42.684
- It doesn't matter. He wins.
- We'll stop him.

01:27:42.978 --> 01:27:47.658
She's with him when he kills Crow.
She's already a part of his future.

01:27:48.024 --> 01:27:51.264
Jad, put everything you've got into
finding that room, and we stop a murder.

01:27:51.570 --> 01:27:54.690
- How much time have we got, Gordon?
- We've got...

01:27:55.158 --> 01:27:57.598
...51 minutes, 30 seconds.

01:27:59.871 --> 01:28:02.751
You cold? Can you understand me?

01:28:03.041 --> 01:28:06.841
Are you cold? The shivers,
it's the drugs we gave you.

01:28:07.170 --> 01:28:11.290
It should wear off soon.
I'm sorry. I need your help.

01:28:11.632 --> 01:28:15.272
You contain information.
I need to know how to get at it.

01:28:16.471 --> 01:28:19.311
Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.400
- Is it now?
- What?

01:28:21.643 --> 01:28:23.403
Is it now?

01:28:25.105 --> 01:28:28.465
Yes, this is all happening right now.

01:28:29.318 --> 01:28:31.438
I'm taking you some place in public...

01:28:31.695 --> 01:28:34.415
...which means you need
something else to wear.

01:28:34.699 --> 01:28:38.579
I'm tired. I'm tired of the future.

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:47.580
Hello, Mr. Yakamoto,
welcome back to the Gap.

01:28:47.879 --> 01:28:51.079
How'd those assorted tank tops
work out for you?

01:28:51.550 --> 01:28:53.670
Mr. Yakamoto?

01:28:57.890 --> 01:29:03.290
Miss Belfor, did you come back for
another pair of those chammy lace-ups?

01:29:17.410 --> 01:29:21.570
- If it's ransom, where's the damn note?
- It has nothing to do with ransom.

01:29:21.915 --> 01:29:25.555
It has to do with the information
inside of Agatha.

01:29:26.836 --> 01:29:31.236
- He's trying to prove his innocence.
- He can't download her without support.

01:29:31.592 --> 01:29:34.072
Your average consumer can't buy
any of this stuff.

01:29:34.344 --> 01:29:38.664
It's been assembled and scrounged
from spare parts made to order.

01:29:40.059 --> 01:29:43.659
Assuming Anderton ordered this,
who put it together?

01:29:53.239 --> 01:29:56.199
Who's Rufus T. Riley?

01:29:58.453 --> 01:30:01.213
What's your pleasure? We got it
all here: Sports fantasies...

01:30:01.498 --> 01:30:03.538
..."Look, Ma, I can fly" fantasies...

01:30:03.792 --> 01:30:07.752
...which covers everything from bungee
jumping to flying over the Grand Canyon.

01:30:08.088 --> 01:30:10.448
You can experience sex as a woman.

01:30:10.716 --> 01:30:14.436
Women come in to get laid
by their favorite soap star.

01:30:14.761 --> 01:30:17.481
Or just some good, clean fun.

01:30:20.226 --> 01:30:23.106
It's a big rush, but you come out
without a heart attack.

01:30:23.395 --> 01:30:26.115
I wanna kill my boss.

01:30:27.734 --> 01:30:28.854
Okay.

01:30:29.528 --> 01:30:33.328
- You got some images I can work with?
- Rufus.

01:30:33.823 --> 01:30:37.143
Yeah, being concertmaster
for the Philadelphia Symphony...

01:30:37.453 --> 01:30:39.133
...is a popular choice.

01:30:39.371 --> 01:30:42.051
- I wanna kill my boss.
- You sick bastard.

01:30:42.332 --> 01:30:45.132
You make this a terrible world
to live in!

01:30:45.419 --> 01:30:49.419
Detective, nice of you to come here,
seeing how every cop is looking for you.

01:30:49.757 --> 01:30:52.317
- I need your help.
- Why'd you come here?

01:30:52.593 --> 01:30:55.673
- I make house calls.
- I need your help with her.

01:30:55.971 --> 01:30:59.451
Hello, honey pie.
I'm impressed. You're on the lam...

01:30:59.809 --> 01:31:03.849
...and you still have the time to
slice off a little... jerky for yourself.

01:31:04.188 --> 01:31:07.268
- She's a Pre-Cog.
- Oh, yeah, okay.

01:31:07.567 --> 01:31:09.727
- That's right.
- She's a Pre-Cog.

01:31:11.613 --> 01:31:14.893
You brought a Pre-Cog here.

01:31:28.964 --> 01:31:30.884
Jesus Christ.

01:31:31.467 --> 01:31:34.267
- Are you reading my mind right now?
- Get up.

01:31:34.762 --> 01:31:39.962
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do.
I swear I didn't do that stuff I did.

01:31:42.562 --> 01:31:46.402
She has information inside her.
I need you to get it out.

01:31:46.733 --> 01:31:49.813
No way. I wouldn't even know
where to begin.

01:31:50.112 --> 01:31:53.432
Those thoughts about my cousin
were just thoughts.

01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:56.060
- You've been busted for felony hacking.
- So?

01:31:56.327 --> 01:31:58.647
So I need you to hack into her.

01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:06.630
I do this, I get to keep
whatever images I get from her head.

01:32:07.005 --> 01:32:10.725
- They don't belong to anybody.
- Take her to RadioShack.

01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:13.910
You're gonna help me.

01:32:20.393 --> 01:32:24.793
Agatha, I need to see. I need to see
what's gonna happen to me.

01:32:26.191 --> 01:32:27.871
And then we'll go.

01:32:42.875 --> 01:32:45.315
- She works.
- Slow it down.

01:32:46.546 --> 01:32:50.186
How do I slow this down?
I should hit her on the head?

01:32:56.222 --> 01:32:59.182
- Are you recording this?
- Shit.

01:32:59.893 --> 01:33:01.613
Yeah, recording.

01:33:28.215 --> 01:33:30.735
I know this already.
Come on. Move on.

01:33:34.054 --> 01:33:35.614
Goodbye, Crow.

01:33:36.557 --> 01:33:38.117
Goodbye, Crow.

01:33:46.233 --> 01:33:48.353
- What happened?
- I don't know.

01:33:48.611 --> 01:33:50.211
- What happened?
- I don't...

01:33:50.446 --> 01:33:53.726
- Where's the rest of it?
- I guess that's all of it.

01:33:55.242 --> 01:33:59.082
Where's my Minority Report?

01:34:00.624 --> 01:34:02.944
Do I even have one?

01:34:07.798 --> 01:34:10.838
- Do I have one?
- No.

01:34:12.636 --> 01:34:15.076
- What?
- No.

01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:24.300
What?

01:34:24.565 --> 01:34:27.605
Agatha? What? What?

01:34:27.943 --> 01:34:30.663
- Can you see?
- See what?

01:34:46.838 --> 01:34:48.638
Anne Lively.

01:34:56.599 --> 01:35:01.079
You want me to see who killed
Anne Lively. Are you recording this?

01:35:01.437 --> 01:35:04.317
Yeah, but it's pouring
out of her backwards.

01:35:09.737 --> 01:35:12.217
I like my life. Everything's good.

01:35:23.460 --> 01:35:25.100
They're inside.

01:35:25.754 --> 01:35:27.314
Who?

01:35:28.382 --> 01:35:30.182
All your old teammates.

01:35:31.259 --> 01:35:34.019
Kenny, left chamber.
Alan, straight across.

01:35:34.305 --> 01:35:35.305
Negative!

01:35:36.474 --> 01:35:37.874
- Negative!
- Negative!

01:35:38.101 --> 01:35:39.541
I don't deserve that.

01:35:39.768 --> 01:35:42.168
- You are the man.
- No, you're the man.

01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:51.230
Can you see the umbrella?

01:35:51.865 --> 01:35:53.465
Take it.

01:35:53.742 --> 01:35:55.342
Take it!

01:35:59.498 --> 01:36:03.858
A man in a blue suit.
He drops his briefcase.

01:36:11.259 --> 01:36:15.099
You see a woman in a brown dress.
She knows your face.

01:36:16.724 --> 01:36:18.564
Turn in here.

01:36:25.275 --> 01:36:26.795
Let's go.

01:36:32.365 --> 01:36:34.285
- Wait.
- No, we can't stop here.

01:36:34.535 --> 01:36:36.535
Can you see the balloon man?

01:36:38.830 --> 01:36:40.230
Wait.

01:36:43.044 --> 01:36:46.684
- Wait.
- What are we waiting for?

01:36:51.885 --> 01:36:54.005
Wait. Wait.

01:36:54.555 --> 01:36:56.075
Wait.

01:36:56.557 --> 01:36:59.717
- Please, Mommy, can I have one?
- All right.

01:37:02.271 --> 01:37:03.271
Wait.

01:37:08.486 --> 01:37:10.326
Thank you.

01:37:10.864 --> 01:37:13.864
- Anybody got an ID? Anybody?
- Negative.

01:37:14.159 --> 01:37:18.479
Scott, Ramos, take the east end.
Everyone else, follow me. Let's go.

01:37:30.385 --> 01:37:32.905
He knows. Don't go home.

01:37:41.479 --> 01:37:42.799
We've got eyes on.

01:37:43.022 --> 01:37:45.582
They're working,
but they're standing on it.

01:37:45.859 --> 01:37:48.659
Please! Please!
Have you got a quarter?

01:37:48.945 --> 01:37:50.825
Drop some money.

01:37:53.117 --> 01:37:55.957
Can't you put it in my hand?

01:37:56.245 --> 01:37:58.765
May the Lord bless you.

01:37:59.039 --> 01:38:02.559
May God take care of you.

01:38:22.564 --> 01:38:23.684
Damn!

01:38:52.512 --> 01:38:55.952
That's the guy.
The man in the window.

01:39:12.366 --> 01:39:16.126
- Rooms are 95 a night.
- Mind if I look at the registry?

01:39:16.454 --> 01:39:18.134
I mind.

01:39:18.622 --> 01:39:19.902
How about now?

01:39:20.207 --> 01:39:22.007
Help yourself.

01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:37.040
He's here.

01:39:37.684 --> 01:39:39.724
Anderton, leave.

01:39:46.694 --> 01:39:49.534
You have a choice.
Walk away. Do it now.

01:39:49.822 --> 01:39:53.342
I can't. I have to find out
what happened in my life.

01:39:53.659 --> 01:39:54.779
Please.

01:39:54.994 --> 01:39:58.994
Agatha, I'm not gonna kill the man.
I don't even know him.

01:39:59.332 --> 01:40:01.452
- What room is Crow in?
- 1006.

01:40:02.419 --> 01:40:03.939
Come on.

01:40:04.296 --> 01:40:05.456
Come on.

01:41:24.755 --> 01:41:26.435
Wrong room.

01:41:55.287 --> 01:41:56.767
Leave.

01:41:57.289 --> 01:41:58.689
Leave.

01:42:55.308 --> 01:42:56.708
Oh, God.

01:43:01.564 --> 01:43:02.804
This is Sean.

01:43:03.483 --> 01:43:05.123
My son.

01:43:09.364 --> 01:43:14.884
Every day for the last six years
I've thought about only two things:

01:43:16.371 --> 01:43:20.611
The first is what my son would
look like if he were alive today...

01:43:21.836 --> 01:43:25.476
...if I would recognize him
if I saw him on the street.

01:43:29.219 --> 01:43:32.779
And the second is what I would do
to the man who took him.

01:43:37.811 --> 01:43:39.371
You're right.

01:43:40.855 --> 01:43:42.495
I'm not being set up.

01:43:45.736 --> 01:43:48.096
You have to take me home.

01:43:53.828 --> 01:43:57.628
You said so yourself.
There is no Minority Report.

01:43:57.957 --> 01:44:00.597
I don't have an alternate future.

01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:04.320
I am going to kill this man.

01:44:07.133 --> 01:44:11.253
You still have a choice.
The others never saw their future.

01:44:11.596 --> 01:44:14.116
You still have a choice.

01:44:15.141 --> 01:44:17.541
- Leo Crow?
- Who the hell are you?

01:44:23.734 --> 01:44:25.174
Six years ago, Baltimore...

01:44:25.402 --> 01:44:29.042
...you grabbed a kid at Francis
public pool on the West End.

01:44:29.448 --> 01:44:33.568
Did I? I don't remember
anything about that place.

01:44:37.832 --> 01:44:39.592
Who am I? Who am I?

01:44:39.834 --> 01:44:41.754
Do you know who I am?

01:44:42.003 --> 01:44:45.403
- You're somebody's father.
- His name is Sean!

01:44:47.592 --> 01:44:48.592
Sean!

01:44:49.511 --> 01:44:52.471
I told him I was a policeman
and needed his help.

01:44:52.764 --> 01:44:57.604
It wasn't so bad. I sang him a song.
I bought him a pretzel.

01:44:57.978 --> 01:45:00.018
He was happy. He was happy.

01:45:00.522 --> 01:45:03.322
Is he alive?
He's alive. Where have you got him?

01:45:03.609 --> 01:45:06.809
Is he all right?
Tell me, you fuck, where is he?!

01:45:07.113 --> 01:45:10.993
I put him in a barrel.
I sunk him in the bay.

01:45:11.325 --> 01:45:14.325
He floated back up. I took him out.

01:45:14.662 --> 01:45:17.702
I was gentle. I was gentle.

01:45:18.833 --> 01:45:20.553
I was gentle.

01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:26.790
I'm sorry.

01:45:27.050 --> 01:45:28.170
I'm sorry.

01:45:28.427 --> 01:45:29.587
I'm sorry.

01:45:29.803 --> 01:45:30.923
I'm sorry.

01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:33.580
I'm so very sorry.

01:45:35.934 --> 01:45:38.254
How could you do that to my...?

01:46:10.804 --> 01:46:12.964
You can choose.

01:46:16.685 --> 01:46:18.325
You can choose.

01:46:37.123 --> 01:46:39.723
You have the right to remain silent.

01:46:40.126 --> 01:46:44.606
Anything you say or do can be used
against you in a court of law.

01:46:45.465 --> 01:46:47.865
You have the right to an attorney...

01:46:48.177 --> 01:46:52.377
...now and during any
further questioning.

01:46:52.765 --> 01:46:55.485
If you can't afford an attorney...

01:46:57.770 --> 01:46:59.730
...we will appoint one.

01:47:01.607 --> 01:47:04.247
Do you understand these rights?

01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:07.440
You're not gonna kill me?

01:47:10.324 --> 01:47:14.444
- Do you understand these rights?
- You're not gonna kill me?

01:47:17.499 --> 01:47:21.379
If you don't go through with this,
my family gets nothing.

01:47:21.712 --> 01:47:25.872
You're supposed to kill me.
He said you would.

01:47:27.301 --> 01:47:29.501
He? Who's he?

01:47:29.762 --> 01:47:32.522
I don't know.
He called me in my cell.

01:47:32.807 --> 01:47:36.927
He told me I'd be released if I went
along, and my family would be cared for.

01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:38.870
If you did what?

01:47:39.105 --> 01:47:40.425
If you did what?

01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:45.509
If I acted like I killed your kid.
Okay?

01:47:47.405 --> 01:47:49.445
If you killed my kid?

01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:53.340
Look, you don't kill me,
my family gets nothing. Okay?

01:47:54.121 --> 01:47:56.321
What about the pictures?

01:47:57.124 --> 01:48:00.924
They're fake. He gave them to me.

01:48:01.462 --> 01:48:03.822
Now, listen to me. You...

01:48:04.131 --> 01:48:07.051
You tell me:
Who was it that set this up?

01:48:08.385 --> 01:48:10.265
I don't know.

01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:12.680
- Come on.
- I'm asking you again:

01:48:12.932 --> 01:48:16.012
- Who put you up to this?
- I didn't see his face.

01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:18.070
I tell you who,
and my family gets nothing.

01:48:18.313 --> 01:48:20.433
- Who made you do this?
- Kill me.

01:48:20.690 --> 01:48:22.930
- You can do this. Kill me.
- Tell me.

01:48:23.192 --> 01:48:26.232
- Kill me.
- Leo, let go of the gun.

01:48:26.530 --> 01:48:28.850
Let go of the gun. It's okay.

01:48:31.117 --> 01:48:35.037
Let go of the gun. That's it.
Let go of the gun.

01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:38.540
You're not gonna kill me.

01:48:39.251 --> 01:48:41.611
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Anderton, wait a sec...!

01:48:55.810 --> 01:48:57.690
- Did you see it?
- Stay back!

01:48:57.937 --> 01:49:00.137
What's happening down there?

01:49:01.275 --> 01:49:02.795
Murder!

01:49:03.152 --> 01:49:05.072
Murder!

01:49:06.947 --> 01:49:08.347
Doesn't make sense.

01:49:08.574 --> 01:49:12.494
If you were a child killer,
would you leave these photos out?

01:49:12.828 --> 01:49:14.828
Anderton might have found them.

01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:17.880
- What kind of cop were you before this?
- Treasury agent.

01:49:18.167 --> 01:49:22.167
This will be your first murder scene?
I worked homicide before federal.

01:49:22.505 --> 01:49:24.465
This is an orgy of evidence.

01:49:24.716 --> 01:49:28.596
- Know how many orgies I had as a cop?
- How many?

01:49:28.928 --> 01:49:30.208
None.

01:49:35.394 --> 01:49:37.234
This was all arranged.

01:49:37.479 --> 01:49:42.399
Today we saw the first murder in the
six years of the Precrime experiment.

01:49:42.776 --> 01:49:45.336
Sadly enough, this failure was human.

01:49:45.612 --> 01:49:48.812
The protection team
simply didn't get there in time.

01:49:49.116 --> 01:49:53.956
But the murder itself happened exactly
as the Pre-Cogs predicted it would.

01:49:54.330 --> 01:49:58.130
Today's event put a human face
on the Precrime system.

01:49:58.459 --> 01:50:02.659
Danny Witwer's on the phone.
He says it's important.

01:50:04.966 --> 01:50:06.566
Lamar?

01:50:13.767 --> 01:50:15.767
- What?
- There's something wrong.

01:50:16.061 --> 01:50:19.981
We're chasing the wrong man.
I don 't wanna say over the phone.

01:50:20.315 --> 01:50:21.995
Meet me at Anderton 's.

01:50:22.234 --> 01:50:25.274
We recovered that
from Leo Crow's hotel room.

01:50:30.952 --> 01:50:34.352
I remember when I gave this
to him, back in Baltimore.

01:50:35.831 --> 01:50:37.431
Please, sir.

01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:41.780
Tell me what you have.

01:50:46.885 --> 01:50:50.245
This is the murder of a woman
named Anne Lively.

01:50:51.807 --> 01:50:55.647
John told me about this.
You got this from Containment?

01:50:55.978 --> 01:50:58.898
Yes. This is from the twins,
Arthur and Dashiell.

01:50:59.189 --> 01:51:01.389
Agatha's stream was missing.

01:51:03.027 --> 01:51:05.467
This one is from the Cyber Parlor.

01:51:05.737 --> 01:51:10.657
Anderton downloaded this directly
from Agatha. Rufus Riley recorded it.

01:51:13.412 --> 01:51:17.052
- It's the same prevision.
- Not quite.

01:51:18.877 --> 01:51:23.237
Look at the surface wind
across the water. Watch the ripples.

01:51:23.757 --> 01:51:26.517
Moving away from shore.

01:51:27.886 --> 01:51:32.526
Now the second image, the one from
Containment that Art and Dash saw.

01:51:33.058 --> 01:51:34.858
Watch the water.

01:51:36.145 --> 01:51:40.985
The wind's changed.
The ripples are moving the other way.

01:51:42.401 --> 01:51:45.761
This murder's taking place
at two different times.

01:51:46.071 --> 01:51:49.551
Anderton was watching this
right before he was tagged.

01:51:49.867 --> 01:51:52.747
He told me about
the missing data stream.

01:51:53.038 --> 01:51:56.758
- He was concerned you might find it.
- He was right. I did.

01:51:57.083 --> 01:51:58.683
It was inside of Agatha.

01:51:58.919 --> 01:52:03.799
So the question is, why would someone
want this erased from the data file?

01:52:04.174 --> 01:52:08.214
Danny, just tell me
what you're thinking.

01:52:08.596 --> 01:52:11.436
I'm thinking someone
got away with murder.

01:52:12.224 --> 01:52:13.344
How?

01:52:13.767 --> 01:52:18.127
Jad told me that sometimes the Pre-Cogs
see the same murder more than once.

01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:22.200
- It's called an echo.
- Jad called it Pre-Cog deja vu.

01:52:22.527 --> 01:52:25.967
We teach the techs to identify
and disregard them.

01:52:26.572 --> 01:52:31.692
Yeah, but what if a technician only
thought he was looking at an echo?

01:52:32.078 --> 01:52:36.638
What if he was looking at a completely
different murder altogether?

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.560
I don't understand.

01:52:38.919 --> 01:52:41.119
All you'd have to do is hire someone
to kill Anne Lively...

01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:44.900
...like a drifter, a neuroin addict,
someone with nothing to lose.

01:52:45.217 --> 01:52:48.017
Precrime stops the murder
from taking place...

01:52:48.304 --> 01:52:53.024
...haloes the killer, takes him away.
But then, right then, someone else...

01:52:53.392 --> 01:52:57.312
...having reviewed the prevision
and dressed in the same clothes...

01:52:57.647 --> 01:53:01.287
...commits the murder
in exactly the same way.

01:53:01.609 --> 01:53:06.769
Technician takes a look, thinks he's
looking at an echo, erases it.

01:53:11.495 --> 01:53:16.135
It'd have to be someone with access
to the previsions in the first place.

01:53:16.499 --> 01:53:18.499
Someone fairly high-up.

01:53:20.754 --> 01:53:22.754
Do you know what I hear?

01:53:24.508 --> 01:53:27.748
Nothing.
No footsteps up the stairs.

01:53:28.054 --> 01:53:32.174
No hovercraft out the window.
No clickety-click of little spyders.

01:53:32.516 --> 01:53:33.916
Do you know why?

01:53:34.143 --> 01:53:37.423
Because right now,
the Pre-Cogs can't see a thing.

01:54:02.465 --> 01:54:05.705
Can you see? It's beautiful.

01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:09.580
- Where are we going?
- Someplace safe.

01:54:17.063 --> 01:54:18.943
- Burgess.
- Lamar, it's Lara.

01:54:19.191 --> 01:54:21.631
- Yes, Lara.
- You have to help him.

01:54:22.902 --> 01:54:23.942
Is he there?

01:54:26.490 --> 01:54:28.010
Is the Pre-Cog with him?

01:54:32.079 --> 01:54:34.559
Keep them there. I'm on my way.

01:54:34.832 --> 01:54:38.272
Please don't tell Danny Witwer.
I don't trust him.

01:54:39.754 --> 01:54:41.914
I won't say a word.

01:54:42.882 --> 01:54:46.602
You just don't let John leave,
all right?

01:54:48.388 --> 01:54:50.028
He's no killer, Lamar.

01:54:50.724 --> 01:54:51.884
I know.

01:55:03.653 --> 01:55:05.093
It's cold.

01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:13.040
Lara, this is Agatha.

01:55:18.294 --> 01:55:23.414
You remember when I would read
Tom Sawyer to you and Sean?

01:55:26.469 --> 01:55:31.669
He got so scared when Tom and Becky
were lost in the cave.

01:55:34.352 --> 01:55:36.592
I gotta sit down.

01:55:37.481 --> 01:55:39.561
I gotta figure this out.

01:55:40.150 --> 01:55:42.310
I gotta figure this out.

01:56:21.861 --> 01:56:23.701
They used Sean.

01:56:25.531 --> 01:56:28.251
They wanted me to think
Crow killed him.

01:56:29.536 --> 01:56:31.016
But he didn't.

01:56:32.663 --> 01:56:34.023
He didn't.

01:56:35.834 --> 01:56:38.274
Why would they set you up?

01:56:45.969 --> 01:56:48.769
Because I found out about her.

01:56:49.806 --> 01:56:51.526
About who?

01:56:51.809 --> 01:56:55.449
- How could I not have seen this?
- Seen what?

01:56:56.814 --> 01:56:58.814
Anne Lively.

01:57:01.402 --> 01:57:02.842
Agatha.

01:57:07.617 --> 01:57:10.617
Dr. Hineman once said,
"The dead don't die...

01:57:10.912 --> 01:57:12.912
...they look on and help. "

01:57:13.748 --> 01:57:15.908
Remember that, John.

01:57:17.085 --> 01:57:18.205
Agatha.

01:57:18.420 --> 01:57:19.980
Sean.

01:57:24.176 --> 01:57:26.536
He's on the beach now...

01:57:27.262 --> 01:57:29.422
...toe in the water.

01:57:30.599 --> 01:57:33.319
He's asking you to come in with him.

01:57:34.103 --> 01:57:37.343
He's been racing his mother
up and down the sand.

01:57:39.275 --> 01:57:42.035
There's so much love in this house.

01:57:47.158 --> 01:57:48.998
He's 10 years old.

01:57:51.496 --> 01:57:54.056
He's surrounded by animals.

01:57:55.417 --> 01:57:57.617
He wants to be a vet.

01:57:59.547 --> 01:58:04.107
You keep a rabbit for him,
a bird and a fox.

01:58:05.803 --> 01:58:07.563
He's in high school.

01:58:08.138 --> 01:58:10.858
He likes to run, like his father.

01:58:11.475 --> 01:58:14.675
He runs the two-mile
and the long relay.

01:58:16.146 --> 01:58:17.826
He's 23.

01:58:19.317 --> 01:58:21.477
He's at a university.

01:58:22.028 --> 01:58:25.108
He makes love
to a pretty girl named Claire.

01:58:25.406 --> 01:58:27.766
He asks her to be his wife.

01:58:28.493 --> 01:58:31.973
He calls here and tells Lara,
who cries.

01:58:33.748 --> 01:58:35.668
He still runs...

01:58:35.959 --> 01:58:40.039
...across the university and
in the stadium, where John watches.

01:58:40.422 --> 01:58:44.782
Oh, God. He's running so fast,
just like his daddy.

01:58:45.553 --> 01:58:49.593
He sees his daddy.
He wants to run to him.

01:58:51.225 --> 01:58:55.625
But he's only 6 years old,
and he can't do it.

01:58:56.314 --> 01:58:58.554
And the other man is so fast.

01:59:02.487 --> 01:59:05.127
There was so much love in this house.

01:59:06.491 --> 01:59:08.731
I want him back so bad.

01:59:11.330 --> 01:59:13.050
So did she.

01:59:13.832 --> 01:59:15.472
Can't you see?

01:59:19.380 --> 01:59:22.460
She just wanted her little girl back.

01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:26.920
But it was too late.

01:59:28.681 --> 01:59:31.081
Her little girl was already gone.

01:59:31.934 --> 01:59:33.454
She's still alive.

01:59:35.146 --> 01:59:36.946
She didn't die.

01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:39.280
But she's not alive.

01:59:41.194 --> 01:59:42.634
Agatha?

01:59:45.324 --> 01:59:46.644
Just tell me...

01:59:47.284 --> 01:59:49.284
...who killed your mother?

01:59:50.037 --> 01:59:52.077
Who killed Anne Lively?

01:59:53.790 --> 01:59:58.510
I'm sorry, John,
but you're gonna have to run again.

01:59:59.505 --> 02:00:01.585
- What?
- Run!

02:00:18.524 --> 02:00:20.124
I love you.

02:00:21.069 --> 02:00:23.749
- It's okay.
- You'll be fine with them.

02:00:24.031 --> 02:00:26.711
- No! No!
- Stay with me. Stay with me.

02:00:26.992 --> 02:00:29.352
- John, no.
- Don't talk.

02:00:46.930 --> 02:00:48.210
John Anderton.

02:00:49.558 --> 02:00:52.638
By mandate of the D.C.
Precrime Division...

02:00:52.936 --> 02:00:57.896
...I'm placing you under arrest for the
murders of Leo Crow and Danny Witwer.

02:01:01.278 --> 02:01:02.838
That's it.

02:01:03.322 --> 02:01:05.002
That's my girl.

02:01:06.908 --> 02:01:09.108
I was so worried about you.

02:01:13.249 --> 02:01:14.969
Did he hurt you?

02:01:18.087 --> 02:01:19.647
I missed you so much.

02:01:19.881 --> 02:01:22.041
It's okay. Wally's here.

02:01:22.843 --> 02:01:24.203
Wally's here.

02:01:29.433 --> 02:01:32.713
You're a part of my flock now, John.

02:01:33.061 --> 02:01:34.501
Welcome.

02:01:35.522 --> 02:01:39.882
It's actually kind of a rush.
They say you have visions...

02:01:40.235 --> 02:01:43.195
...that your life flashes
before your eyes...

02:01:43.489 --> 02:01:46.809
...that all your dreams come true.

02:02:03.718 --> 02:02:05.918
This is all my fault.

02:02:07.013 --> 02:02:09.493
There was nothing anyone could do.

02:02:14.021 --> 02:02:16.701
I thought you might want
to have those.

02:02:22.613 --> 02:02:27.493
I haven't worn this in years. I wanted
to make sure it fits before tonight.

02:02:27.869 --> 02:02:29.149
You look great.

02:02:29.370 --> 02:02:33.450
I knew he was having trouble
for some time, yet I did nothing.

02:02:33.792 --> 02:02:37.192
- The guy from USA Today is here.
- Tell him not now.

02:02:37.503 --> 02:02:40.823
- He just wanted a few minutes before...
- Not now!

02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:46.910
- I thought you were retiring.
- Well, I was.

02:02:47.264 --> 02:02:52.784
But this incident with John made me
realize the fragility of all this.

02:02:53.562 --> 02:02:56.762
This is John's legacy
as much as it is my own.

02:02:57.692 --> 02:03:01.012
Now I have an obligation
to protect that.

02:03:01.695 --> 02:03:05.095
Lara, I know how difficult
this is for you.

02:03:05.408 --> 02:03:08.648
But maybe you can find
some closure in the fact...

02:03:08.953 --> 02:03:13.233
...that John finally found
the man who killed your son.

02:03:16.253 --> 02:03:17.533
Who's Anne Lively?

02:03:20.424 --> 02:03:22.784
- Who?
- Anne Lively.

02:03:23.344 --> 02:03:27.104
John was talking about her
right before they took him.

02:03:27.431 --> 02:03:29.511
I don't know who that is.

02:03:30.768 --> 02:03:35.768
John said something about him being
set up because he found out about her.

02:03:36.148 --> 02:03:40.908
- Well, we know why John was tagged.
- He also said Crow was a fake.

02:03:41.278 --> 02:03:45.638
And Witwer? He was killed with
John's gun inside John's apartment.

02:03:45.992 --> 02:03:50.032
Do you know the reason why
John came here to work for you?

02:03:50.371 --> 02:03:51.691
- Sean.
- Yes.

02:03:52.540 --> 02:03:55.700
He came here to work for you
because he thought...

02:03:56.003 --> 02:04:00.443
...if he could just stop
that kind of thing from happening...

02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:04.380
- I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.

02:04:04.679 --> 02:04:09.239
Sir, they wanna start
the press conference in two minutes.

02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:10.720
Lara...

02:04:11.227 --> 02:04:13.987
...John was the best cop I ever knew...

02:04:14.313 --> 02:04:17.033
...and, in some ways,
also the best man.

02:04:17.316 --> 02:04:19.676
But the scars he carried around...

02:04:19.945 --> 02:04:25.105
Well, I know he'd want us to honor
the good things we remember about him.

02:04:25.492 --> 02:04:30.932
And I also know why he married you:
You're as stubborn as he is.

02:04:31.331 --> 02:04:35.531
- Lamar...
- Do you know how to tie one of these?

02:04:35.878 --> 02:04:40.118
Could you please give me a hand?
I'm all thumbs, as you see.

02:04:48.140 --> 02:04:50.820
Listen, I'll tell you what I'll do.

02:04:51.102 --> 02:04:55.222
First thing Monday,
I'll look over the Witwer evidence.

02:04:55.565 --> 02:04:59.085
And I'll have Gideon
run the Containment files...

02:04:59.402 --> 02:05:02.322
...see if anyone drowned a woman
by the name of...

02:05:02.613 --> 02:05:05.293
What did you say her name was?

02:05:07.494 --> 02:05:09.134
Anne Lively.

02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:12.270
But I never said she drowned.

02:05:32.228 --> 02:05:36.868
- Sir, the press conference is starting.
- I'll be right there.

02:05:41.739 --> 02:05:44.059
We'll talk about this later.

02:05:44.908 --> 02:05:49.308
Perhaps tomorrow,
I'll come by the cottage.

02:06:26.243 --> 02:06:28.683
I'd like a word with my husband.

02:06:29.497 --> 02:06:32.417
You're not authorized.

02:06:32.750 --> 02:06:35.350
How did you get in here?

02:06:44.137 --> 02:06:45.417
Thank you.

02:06:45.639 --> 02:06:50.759
Ladies and gentlemen, Lamar Burgess,
director of the new National Precrime.

02:06:53.605 --> 02:06:57.325
On behalf of your staff,
we present you with this.

02:06:57.651 --> 02:07:01.331
- Congratulations, sir.
- My God.

02:07:02.615 --> 02:07:04.055
How did you get this?

02:07:04.283 --> 02:07:07.283
I padded your expense account
for six months.

02:07:09.831 --> 02:07:13.511
Revolvers like this one
were given to generals...

02:07:13.834 --> 02:07:16.874
...at the end of the Civil War
by their troops.

02:07:17.172 --> 02:07:20.972
The cylinders were loaded
with five gold-plated bullets...

02:07:21.300 --> 02:07:24.460
...to symbolize the end
of the destruction and death...

02:07:24.763 --> 02:07:27.163
...that had ripped the country apart
for five years.

02:07:27.433 --> 02:07:30.793
Ladies and gentlemen,
with Precrime going national...

02:07:31.103 --> 02:07:34.983
...maybe we can all look forward
to a time when none of us...

02:07:35.316 --> 02:07:38.516
...will have to discharge
another firearm ever again.

02:07:39.987 --> 02:07:44.507
Now enjoy yourselves.
Enjoy yourselves! That's an order.

02:07:47.578 --> 02:07:51.698
Does this mean we can finally use
the lake house on weekends?

02:07:54.627 --> 02:07:55.827
Hello.

02:07:56.045 --> 02:07:58.445
Yes. Right away.

02:07:58.840 --> 02:08:01.840
- Excuse me, so sorry.
- Excuse me.

02:08:02.177 --> 02:08:03.497
- Sir?
- Yes.

02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:07.280
Sir, you have an emergency call
on your private line.

02:08:08.517 --> 02:08:10.157
Yes, this is Burgess.

02:08:10.393 --> 02:08:14.793
Hello, Lamar. I just wanted
to congratulate you. You did it.

02:08:15.149 --> 02:08:17.549
You created a world without murder.

02:08:17.818 --> 02:08:20.858
Everyone wants your name on a hat.
Can you sign these?

02:08:21.155 --> 02:08:23.515
All you had to do was kill someone
to do it.

02:08:28.371 --> 02:08:29.371
A-room. Jad.

02:08:30.415 --> 02:08:33.615
Jad, it's Lara. John needs a favor.

02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:38.360
- What are you talking about?
- Agatha 's mother, Anne Lively.

02:08:38.715 --> 02:08:42.875
Just a junkie who had a kid once
and had to give her up, but surprise!

02:08:43.220 --> 02:08:46.060
She cleaned herself up,
and she wanted her daughter back.

02:08:46.348 --> 02:08:48.228
She wanted Agatha.

02:08:50.811 --> 02:08:55.051
Jad, you getting this? It's from the
female only. No time or incident data.

02:08:55.399 --> 02:08:57.759
It isn't the future.
It already happened.

02:08:58.028 --> 02:09:01.628
And the problem was, without Agatha,
there was no Precrime.

02:09:01.948 --> 02:09:06.548
She's the strongest of the three.
Without Agatha, you had nothing.

02:09:06.911 --> 02:09:12.111
You wouldn't be where you are now,
standing there, signing autographs.

02:09:20.175 --> 02:09:23.455
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing with that?

02:09:23.762 --> 02:09:27.202
- What you up to, big man?
- Think before you send that.

02:09:27.516 --> 02:09:28.516
Slow down.

02:09:49.164 --> 02:09:53.684
Now you had to get rid of Anne Lively,
which presented a problem:

02:09:54.044 --> 02:09:57.564
How can you kill her
without the Pre-Cogs seeing it?

02:09:57.881 --> 02:10:01.961
Simple. Use a system
you control against her.

02:10:02.345 --> 02:10:07.345
You hired someone to kill her, knowing
the Pre-Cogs would see that murder.

02:10:07.725 --> 02:10:11.125
You lured Anne Lively
out to the lake...

02:10:11.437 --> 02:10:15.277
...with the promise of reuniting her
with her daughter.

02:10:59.947 --> 02:11:01.867
Where's my daughter?

02:11:09.206 --> 02:11:10.366
Where?

02:11:12.459 --> 02:11:13.699
Run!

02:11:17.172 --> 02:11:18.252
Run!

02:11:29.936 --> 02:11:33.136
When you were all alone,
you killed her yourself...

02:11:33.439 --> 02:11:37.239
...in the same way the Pre-Cogs
predicted your John Doe would kill her.

02:11:37.569 --> 02:11:40.369
You made the real murder
look like an echo...

02:11:40.655 --> 02:11:45.215
...knowing the tech would do what
he was trained to do: Disregard it.

02:11:51.166 --> 02:11:55.446
Anne Lively became
just another missing person.

02:11:56.256 --> 02:11:59.296
So, what are you gonna do, Lamar?

02:12:00.176 --> 02:12:02.016
What are you gonna do?

02:12:13.231 --> 02:12:14.511
We got a Red Ball!

02:12:20.740 --> 02:12:23.540
Think about the lives
that little girl has saved.

02:12:23.826 --> 02:12:26.586
Think about the lives
that little girl has saved.

02:12:26.871 --> 02:12:31.271
Think of all the lives she will save.
She could have saved Sean.

02:12:31.625 --> 02:12:34.105
Don't you ever say his name!

02:12:36.423 --> 02:12:39.463
You used the memory of my dead son
to set me up.

02:12:39.759 --> 02:12:42.639
You used the memory of my dead son
to set me up.

02:12:42.929 --> 02:12:45.809
You knew that would
drive me to murder.

02:12:46.099 --> 02:12:49.379
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?

02:12:49.686 --> 02:12:51.606
- How are you gonna...?
- Shut me up?

02:12:51.855 --> 02:12:54.095
Forgive me, John.

02:13:02.533 --> 02:13:04.253
Forgive me, John.

02:13:15.922 --> 02:13:17.202
Lamar.

02:13:17.674 --> 02:13:19.034
It's over.

02:13:19.759 --> 02:13:24.839
The question you have to ask is,
what are you gonna do now?

02:13:38.237 --> 02:13:41.157
No doubt the Pre-Cogs have
already seen this.

02:13:41.449 --> 02:13:43.049
No doubt.

02:13:44.118 --> 02:13:46.358
You see the dilemma, don't you?

02:13:47.121 --> 02:13:51.361
If you don't kill me, Pre-Cogs were
wrong and Precrime is over.

02:13:52.585 --> 02:13:55.985
If you do kill me, you go away...

02:13:56.632 --> 02:14:00.912
...but it proves the system works.
Pre-Cogs were right.

02:14:07.184 --> 02:14:10.424
So, what are you gonna do now?

02:14:11.856 --> 02:14:13.776
What's it worth?

02:14:14.651 --> 02:14:16.891
Just one more murder.

02:14:19.822 --> 02:14:24.742
You'll rot in hell with a halo, but
people will still believe in Precrime.

02:14:25.119 --> 02:14:28.999
All you have to do is kill me,
like they said you would.

02:14:32.502 --> 02:14:34.022
Except...

02:14:34.963 --> 02:14:37.323
...you know your own future...

02:14:37.633 --> 02:14:41.113
...which means you can change it
if you want to.

02:14:42.304 --> 02:14:45.224
You still have a choice, Lamar.

02:14:45.808 --> 02:14:47.608
Like I did.

02:14:52.356 --> 02:14:54.996
Yes, I have a choice...

02:14:56.402 --> 02:14:58.322
...and I made it.

02:14:59.322 --> 02:15:01.242
Forgive me, John.

02:15:02.909 --> 02:15:04.629
Forgive me.

02:15:09.958 --> 02:15:11.598
Forgive me, my boy.

02:15:30.312 --> 02:15:31.832
Lamar!

02:15:43.076 --> 02:15:47.716
In 2054, the six-year Precrime
experiment was abandoned.

02:15:55.339 --> 02:15:58.699
All prisoners were unconditionally
pardoned and released...

02:15:59.010 --> 02:16:03.130
...although police departments
kept watch on many of them for years.

02:16:51.064 --> 02:16:53.343
Agatha and the twins...

02:16:53.608 --> 02:16:56.848
...were transferred
to an undisclosed location...

02:16:57.820 --> 02:17:01.260
...a place where they could
find relief from their gifts...

02:17:01.700 --> 02:17:05.540
...a place where they could
live out their lives in peace.
