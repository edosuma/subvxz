00:01.920 --> 00:04.255
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:05.131 --> 00:07.050
A team centred
around people with powers?

00:07.133 --> 00:09.594
<i>There exists a small percentage
of the population</i>

00:09.719 --> 00:11.137
<i>with a dormant alien gene.</i>

00:11.763 --> 00:14.849
<i>There's a chemical compound
that activates this gene.</i>

00:14.933 --> 00:17.143
And you, Joey,
are one of the first people

00:17.268 --> 00:18.561
to come into contact with it.

00:18.645 --> 00:21.481
No leadership
means nobody giving orders,

00:21.606 --> 00:23.566
and that sure as hell includes you.

00:25.402 --> 00:26.528
I'm done flying solo.

00:26.611 --> 00:28.113
I miss having a team around me.

00:28.238 --> 00:31.991
I miss her too. I'm having
a hard time accepting it. All of it.

00:32.116 --> 00:34.119
I'm on my third hand.

00:34.244 --> 00:36.413
<i>May took off on vacation
and never came back,</i>

00:36.496 --> 00:37.831
<i>so I lost my right hand too.</i>

00:38.289 --> 00:39.708
<i>We need to say goodbye.</i>

00:39.791 --> 00:41.751
<i>Jemma would want us to do that.</i>

00:44.963 --> 00:47.966
Do something!

01:26.921 --> 01:29.382
May our gifts see you
through the journey.

01:42.353 --> 01:43.521
Perhaps it would...

01:43.605 --> 01:44.814
What if I fail to return?

01:44.898 --> 01:46.775
Be brave, My Lord.

02:11.382 --> 02:12.467
Will he come back?

02:12.550 --> 02:16.137
Our best minds are
working to understand this,

02:16.221 --> 02:19.390
but as far as we know, in all of history,

02:21.434 --> 02:23.895
no one has ever returned.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.319
I think Joey's a real candidate.

02:31.402 --> 02:33.238
Sure, he's Inhuman.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.698
But doesn't meet my criteria.

02:35.782 --> 02:37.909
He's a decent guy and you know it.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.953
Getting that unit up and running
is priority.

02:40.078 --> 02:42.080
Yeah, but it doesn't mean
it has to be a rush job.

02:42.163 --> 02:45.500
Look, Dr Garner will
make his recommendation.

02:45.583 --> 02:46.709
And it'll be the same as always.

02:46.793 --> 02:49.921
"Three months' observation
and counselling before reassessment."

02:50.004 --> 02:52.131
He's as much of a buzzkill as you are.

02:53.258 --> 02:56.386
And if you haven't been keeping score,
our team is down to three musketeers.

02:56.469 --> 02:58.012
May and Simmons are gone,

02:58.096 --> 03:00.014
Fitz might as well be,
Bobbi's on the DL,

03:00.098 --> 03:01.850
and from what I hear,
Hunter's planning to leave?

03:01.933 --> 03:04.811
Yeah, but not for good.
He's got a score to settle.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.815
- It's Fitz!
- Fitz broke into containment!

03:15.989 --> 03:17.198
- Fitz!
- Get out of there!

03:17.282 --> 03:18.449
Are you crazy?

03:18.533 --> 03:19.617
Close it! Close it!

03:19.701 --> 03:20.827
I've got it!

03:33.214 --> 03:34.674
Damn it, Fitz!

03:34.799 --> 03:36.217
I had to know. I had to know...

03:36.301 --> 03:38.928
I already lost Simmons to that thing,
I cannot afford to lose you too.

03:39.012 --> 03:40.263
You trying to get yourself killed?

03:40.346 --> 03:42.473
Sorry.

03:43.016 --> 03:46.060
I won't give up. I can't give up.

03:46.144 --> 03:48.021
None of us want to, Fitz. But...

03:49.856 --> 03:52.150
Fitz, you tried.

03:52.233 --> 03:54.152
Okay? You tried your hardest.

03:54.235 --> 03:55.361
Everybody knows that.

03:55.486 --> 03:58.239
No, I've missed something.

03:58.323 --> 04:00.533
I'm... I've missed something.

04:04.245 --> 04:05.371
What is that?

04:06.998 --> 04:08.666
Proof.

04:12.170 --> 04:13.338
Sand.

04:13.421 --> 04:16.214
Not just sand, impossible sand.

04:16.341 --> 04:17.841
The Monolith's case is a clean room.

04:17.926 --> 04:19.969
There's nothing in there but that rock,
not even dust.

04:20.053 --> 04:23.514
Unless you blast it open with a shotgun
and contaminate everything.

04:23.598 --> 04:24.724
That's not what this is.

04:24.849 --> 04:26.225
Okay, the sand itself, not unusual.

04:26.351 --> 04:29.020
Mostly silicon dioxide particles.
Just like on Earth.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.480
But you're saying
this sand is not from Earth.

04:30.563 --> 04:31.773
Sir, carbon dating shows that...

04:31.856 --> 04:33.858
It pre-dates the Earth by a billion years.

04:36.736 --> 04:38.279
So you think the rock is a portal?

04:38.363 --> 04:41.240
No. No, I'm proving that it's a portal.

04:41.366 --> 04:43.910
Okay? To another planet.
A very old planet.

04:44.035 --> 04:46.746
A crack in space-time
that carried Simmons away

04:46.871 --> 04:49.040
and carried the sand back.

04:49.123 --> 04:50.458
Which means...

04:50.541 --> 04:52.043
She's out there.

04:54.420 --> 04:55.588
But it's been months.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.215
Yeah.

04:58.716 --> 05:01.219
She could be long gone
from wherever this thing dropped her.

05:01.302 --> 05:02.595
- Yeah.
- She could be dead.

05:03.554 --> 05:04.889
Yes.

05:06.724 --> 05:08.309
But we're going to find out, aren't we?

05:08.434 --> 05:09.519
- Yeah.
- Damn right.

05:09.602 --> 05:10.687
Yeah.

05:10.770 --> 05:13.106
Okay, Fitz, what do you need?

05:13.231 --> 05:14.565
Uh, uh...

05:14.649 --> 05:17.860
Well, more historical data. People
have studied this thing for centuries.

05:17.944 --> 05:23.074
I need an expert on quantum mechanics
and Einstein-Rosen Bridge theory.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.450
And a sandwich would be nice.

05:24.575 --> 05:25.952
I might have an idea.

05:26.077 --> 05:27.745
About the other things.

05:27.829 --> 05:30.289
You two,
stay with our new Inhuman guest.

05:30.415 --> 05:32.000
Be here for Dr Garner's assessment.

05:32.083 --> 05:34.127
Building that team is still the priority.

05:34.252 --> 05:35.586
- What did I say?
- Bobbi.

05:35.670 --> 05:36.796
I'm on this with Fitz.

05:36.921 --> 05:40.466
Yeah. Haven't you been
on this with Fitz the whole time?

05:40.591 --> 05:43.928
Hiding his trip to Morocco,
covering for him on a constant basis.

05:44.012 --> 05:45.471
Have I?

05:48.474 --> 05:49.600
And you know where you're going.

05:53.271 --> 05:54.814
Coulson would be pissed
if he knew what you had planned.

05:54.939 --> 05:56.065
Part of our agreement.

05:56.149 --> 05:58.443
He won't sweat the details
and I won't share them.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.611
You really think
Ward is back with HYDRA?

06:02.363 --> 06:03.865
Damn, I want to go after him with you.

06:03.948 --> 06:05.199
You're still on the mend.

06:05.283 --> 06:06.409
Plus, you've been undercover
at HYDRA,

06:06.492 --> 06:07.702
and that face makes an impression.

06:08.828 --> 06:10.955
The rest of you
makes a bloody statement.

06:12.123 --> 06:13.958
You like me stuck here in the lab.

06:14.042 --> 06:15.501
Too bloody right.

06:16.794 --> 06:18.337
You're missing half a lung
because you took a bullet

06:18.463 --> 06:20.923
that Ward intended for me,
nearly bled out in my arms.

06:21.007 --> 06:22.133
If you being in the lab means

06:22.216 --> 06:24.343
I never have to see something
like that again, I'm all for it.

06:24.469 --> 06:26.345
Bobbi, you want to fly?

06:26.471 --> 06:27.722
- Desperately.
- Good.

06:27.805 --> 06:29.265
Here's our destination.

06:29.348 --> 06:31.059
Who's Professor Randolph?

06:31.142 --> 06:33.102
This monolith has been
studied for centuries?

06:33.186 --> 06:36.481
Well, Randolph has actually
been on the planet for those centuries.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.483
And he's travelled
through space in a portal.

06:38.566 --> 06:42.153
And he's also an alien,
so he's got a lot going for him.

06:49.494 --> 06:50.912
Don't die out there.

06:52.538 --> 06:53.998
And Hunter?

06:54.082 --> 06:55.500
Make sure he does.

07:08.513 --> 07:09.764
Hell of a machine, Kebo.

07:09.847 --> 07:12.725
Built for precision and speed.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.230
Designed to handle flawlessly
under any conditions.

07:18.106 --> 07:20.691
Carmine here
bought it as a status symbol.

07:20.775 --> 07:22.193
To show off.

07:22.276 --> 07:23.778
Never opened it up.

07:23.861 --> 07:26.030
Denied it of its true purpose.

07:29.117 --> 07:30.701
HYDRA's full of guys like him.

07:30.785 --> 07:34.664
Soft, entitled,
mistaking wealth for success.

07:34.747 --> 07:36.415
Privilege for power.

07:37.083 --> 07:40.128
Their greed splintered HYDRA
into a thousand pieces.

07:40.211 --> 07:41.712
Their time is over.

07:42.130 --> 07:44.882
Time for a leaner generation.

07:55.143 --> 07:57.311
These people have
proven themselves in blood.

07:57.395 --> 07:58.980
See how they didn't even flinch?

07:59.063 --> 08:00.523
Now's your chance.

08:00.606 --> 08:03.192
To prove you still have purpose.

08:03.276 --> 08:05.444
Show me you're not dead weight.

08:10.408 --> 08:11.826
So tell me.

08:13.077 --> 08:14.579
Where's the kid?

08:15.413 --> 08:17.331
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

08:17.415 --> 08:18.499
Can't or won't?

08:19.333 --> 08:20.835
Potato, puh-tah-toe.

08:20.918 --> 08:22.044
And your reason?

08:22.128 --> 08:25.298
The nightly news,
cities flying into the atmosphere,

08:25.381 --> 08:26.966
government task forces.

08:27.049 --> 08:30.261
And now the public is freaking out
about alien outbreaks.

08:30.344 --> 08:34.849
Pretty crappy time to be on Earth
if you're not a local, so I am laying low.

08:34.932 --> 08:39.061
And of course,
there is my current situation.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.981
Destruction of property,
public drunkenness.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.901
Yes. Well, Asgardians can generally
hold their drink.

08:44.984 --> 08:48.237
It's just, well, one night
I tried to hold all the drinks.

08:48.321 --> 08:51.782
Asgardians are also strong, right?
You could easily break out.

08:51.866 --> 08:54.410
What, and miss dinner?

08:54.744 --> 08:57.830
Oh, no, Norwegian prisons
are surprisingly evolved.

08:57.914 --> 09:02.043
Decent food, comfy bed,
extensive library.

09:02.126 --> 09:04.754
And no attention being drawn to me.

09:04.837 --> 09:06.631
Come back in a few months,
why don't you?

09:06.714 --> 09:07.965
Maybe then I'll be in the mood.

09:08.049 --> 09:09.967
We don't have a few months.

09:10.051 --> 09:11.177
And neither do you.

09:12.053 --> 09:14.639
I don't have to remind you
that I saved your life,

09:14.722 --> 09:16.849
though I did just mention it
in case you forgot.

09:16.933 --> 09:20.561
But I'd still have no problems contacting
those task forces you mentioned.

09:20.645 --> 09:23.522
I bet they'd go bonkers
to have a real live Asgardian

09:23.606 --> 09:25.775
to dissect in their labs.

09:25.858 --> 09:28.027
I don't know how comfy you'd be there.

09:28.110 --> 09:30.488
Why, Agent Coulson,

09:33.282 --> 09:35.159
are you threatening me?

09:35.243 --> 09:37.536
I wouldn't call it a...

09:37.620 --> 09:40.623
Well, yeah, I guess I am.

09:40.706 --> 09:42.458
That's absolutely a threat.

09:42.541 --> 09:44.377
You're different now, you know that?

09:44.460 --> 09:47.171
One must accommodate the times.

09:47.255 --> 09:48.547
Or things get messy.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.549
What's with the hand?

09:51.509 --> 09:52.885
Things got messy.

09:57.974 --> 09:59.517
Well, you'll have to cover my release.

10:00.142 --> 10:02.561
And if there is a portal,
which I will have to see to believe,

10:02.645 --> 10:04.939
you are diving into
very dangerous waters here.

10:08.192 --> 10:12.071
All right. Well, it's not like
you're giving me any choice.

10:20.538 --> 10:21.622
He did it.

10:33.551 --> 10:35.052
Good to see you, Dr Garner.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.930
Hmm, enjoying the use
of the private jet?

10:38.014 --> 10:39.307
It's very helpful, thanks.

10:39.390 --> 10:41.642
Those jump seats aren't made
for transcontinental trips,

10:41.726 --> 10:42.810
I'll tell you that.

10:42.893 --> 10:45.146
Are you hungry? I can
have something whipped up for you.

10:45.229 --> 10:46.439
That'd be great, thanks.

10:46.522 --> 10:48.107
Anything to drink?

10:48.190 --> 10:49.650
Daisy, trying to butter me up?

10:50.735 --> 10:52.111
What, are you not hungry?

10:52.194 --> 10:54.613
Hey, look, my job is
to keep everyone safe.

10:54.697 --> 10:57.408
Not just potential recruits,
but you as well.

10:57.491 --> 11:00.077
Bribery's not going to get this guy
approved for the team any faster.

11:00.161 --> 11:02.830
Wouldn't know because
you haven't approved anyone yet.

11:03.205 --> 11:05.583
Well, here's Joey Gutierrez.

11:06.459 --> 11:08.336
Yeah, I was reading his file
on the flight.

11:08.419 --> 11:10.463
Liquefies metal. How's he holding up?

11:10.546 --> 11:11.714
Well, he's terrified.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.716
That's a healthy response.

11:13.799 --> 11:15.176
What about you two?
How are you guys...

11:15.259 --> 11:17.219
Uh-uh-uh. You're not getting me
on the couch today, Doc,

11:17.303 --> 11:18.888
unless it's a conversation
between friends.

11:18.971 --> 11:20.890
That's all I meant.

11:20.973 --> 11:22.433
Great. How's May?

11:22.516 --> 11:24.518
Where is she?
Is she ever coming back?

11:25.186 --> 11:26.896
You should ask her yourself.

11:28.397 --> 11:30.733
I would if I knew where she was.

11:36.405 --> 11:39.158
No, no, no.
You don't watch where the ball goes.

11:39.241 --> 11:40.326
Then how would I find it?

11:40.409 --> 11:43.537
You're usually very good
at things like this, a natural.

11:43.621 --> 11:45.623
Well, there's nothing natural
about this game.

11:45.706 --> 11:49.168
But your comments
after every swing make it super fun.

11:49.251 --> 11:50.961
You'll get hooked. You'll see.

11:51.045 --> 11:53.130
All right. Fair's fair.

11:53.214 --> 11:55.424
Ten shots for me, five reps for you.

11:55.508 --> 11:56.759
That's why we're here.

11:56.842 --> 11:58.052
Work that hip.

11:58.135 --> 12:00.471
You don't have to worry
about my rehab.

12:00.554 --> 12:03.057
And that's not why you're here.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.435
I may not be a spy,

12:06.519 --> 12:10.439
but 20 years with your mother
has taught me to pick up on things.

12:10.523 --> 12:12.525
You're not here
because you care about me.

12:12.608 --> 12:13.984
Oh, now I don't care about you?

12:14.068 --> 12:15.861
I didn't say that.

12:15.945 --> 12:18.989
I said that's not why you're here.

12:20.241 --> 12:21.617
Come on, Mellie.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.621
You take a trip to Honolulu
with Andrew...

12:25.704 --> 12:27.081
It was Maui.

12:27.164 --> 12:29.375
...and you come back
the daughter of the year.

12:29.458 --> 12:31.419
Something is not right.

12:33.754 --> 12:36.215
All right, I'll figure it out for myself.

12:42.972 --> 12:46.475
Well, I hate to disappoint,
but it looks like a regular old...

12:50.479 --> 12:51.564
Oh.

12:52.356 --> 12:54.358
How often does it do that?

12:54.442 --> 12:55.568
- It's random.
- No.

12:55.651 --> 12:58.320
No, no, no, no.
It may seem random, but this...

12:58.404 --> 12:59.905
Something is clearly triggering it.

12:59.989 --> 13:02.491
I've checked it against tides,
relation to the sun, rotation...

13:02.575 --> 13:04.201
On this planet.

13:04.285 --> 13:06.328
So you have no idea how to control it.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.583
Why come to me?
I'm no interstellar travel expert.

13:10.666 --> 13:12.835
I've never even studied
gravitational lensing,

13:12.918 --> 13:15.212
or zero-point energy fields,

13:16.255 --> 13:18.799
or quantum harmonic
oscillation theory...

13:18.883 --> 13:20.426
Yet you know all those words
you just said.

13:20.509 --> 13:21.886
And you're scared of portals.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.638
You're scared of being dragged back
home through a portal.

13:24.722 --> 13:26.932
So I think, in your drunken stumble
through history,

13:27.016 --> 13:29.477
you've probably investigated
every story involving one.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.937
And I've seen you eyeing all your exits.

13:32.021 --> 13:34.815
My knee brace.
Wondering if you can get away with it.

13:34.899 --> 13:37.568
The only reason you came with us
was to confirm its existence.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.361
And destroy it.

13:39.445 --> 13:41.405
You'll have to go through me.

13:43.949 --> 13:46.202
And I could, literally.

13:46.285 --> 13:49.371
But then, I don't know
what Amazon Woman and Robot Hand

13:49.455 --> 13:50.998
are capable of these days.

13:51.081 --> 13:52.875
So, I will help you get her back.

13:52.958 --> 13:54.376
I'm not entirely heartless.

13:54.460 --> 13:58.714
But if I do, I want your word
that we will demolish this portal.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.591
And no one passes through it again.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.468
- I'll sleep better at night.
- Good.

14:02.551 --> 14:05.095
Well, I've investigated
a lot of these wormhole rumours.

14:05.179 --> 14:07.681
But that's all they were, rumours.
None have panned out.

14:07.765 --> 14:09.350
So we know nothing of its origin?

14:09.433 --> 14:10.559
Kree, maybe.

14:10.643 --> 14:12.436
And this parchment was found with it.

14:17.399 --> 14:18.776
Well, hello.

14:20.986 --> 14:22.404
I've seen this.

14:22.488 --> 14:23.906
It's a common Hebrew word.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.282
Yes.

14:26.242 --> 14:27.743
What else do we know, Mr Fitz?

14:27.826 --> 14:30.246
Uh, the Monolith changed hands a lot.
Germanic tribes.

14:30.329 --> 14:31.747
Spent the Hundred Years' War
in France.

14:31.830 --> 14:33.791
But before the Napoleon era,
it was moved again.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.960
- I lost track of it somewhere in...
- England.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.962
Yeah. How'd you know that?

14:38.045 --> 14:41.173
Because I have seen this word
carved into the walls of the castle

14:41.257 --> 14:44.260
in Gloucestershire, England in 1853.

14:44.343 --> 14:45.427
To the plane!

14:49.974 --> 14:51.308
Am I allowed to say that?

14:52.309 --> 14:54.311
Let's all go to the plane, I guess.

15:00.609 --> 15:03.696
What's the point of a boat
if you never take it out of the dock?

15:03.779 --> 15:05.573
It's like camping in a living room.

15:07.408 --> 15:09.076
There.

15:09.159 --> 15:12.288
There are easier ways
of getting money than kidnapping.

15:12.371 --> 15:16.083
Mr Braun needs to see the world
for what it really is.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.377
He can open many doors for us.

15:18.460 --> 15:22.840
Sorry, girls. I'm not allowed to post.
But I'm happy to take some of you.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.383
That's great.

15:25.009 --> 15:28.470
Great. Get closer together? Perfect.

15:43.068 --> 15:44.486
What's going on down there?

15:49.742 --> 15:50.826
Private party.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.953
It's okay. I'm on the list.

15:58.459 --> 15:59.543
Down below!

16:30.699 --> 16:32.493
It's a good thing I dropped by.

16:32.576 --> 16:33.911
Why's that?

16:33.994 --> 16:35.496
I'm an exterminator.

16:41.877 --> 16:43.837
Yes, yes. Yes.

16:43.921 --> 16:47.257
I came here for a costume ball.

16:47.341 --> 16:49.218
That was the pretext, of course.

16:49.301 --> 16:51.804
I'd heard rumours of travel to the stars.

16:51.887 --> 16:54.431
Found it all to be nonsense.

16:54.515 --> 16:55.933
But it was a fun party.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.184
The carvings?

16:57.267 --> 16:58.769
Oh, right. Right, of course.

16:58.852 --> 17:02.231
So I was here,
admiring the stone work, and...

17:06.944 --> 17:08.612
Same as the scroll.

17:08.695 --> 17:09.780
"Death."

17:09.863 --> 17:10.948
<i>Maveth.</i>

17:11.573 --> 17:15.452
Yeah, one of its translations
is actually, "Death by punishment."

17:15.536 --> 17:17.413
Could mean "No trespassing."

17:17.496 --> 17:20.290
A Hebrew warning
carved in an English castle

17:20.374 --> 17:23.502
struck me as odd, out of place.

17:23.585 --> 17:24.920
Seems ancient.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.380
But you stopped looking into it?

17:26.463 --> 17:28.966
A man dressed as an owl, of all things,

17:29.049 --> 17:30.426
I got him drunk enough to admit

17:30.509 --> 17:33.679
that no travel to other worlds
was even occurring,

17:33.762 --> 17:36.390
just ritualistic killings.

17:36.473 --> 17:39.268
Yeah, the whole thing stunk
of half-baked Satanism,

17:39.351 --> 17:43.647
just fabrications
to entice new members.

17:43.731 --> 17:47.651
And, well, there were fire-dancers.
I got distracted.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.154
Here's another one.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.531
This is why I got rid of all
the S.H.I.E.L.D. logos on our vehicles.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.616
It's like screaming for attention.

17:54.700 --> 17:58.245
You know, there's a ginormous
eagle symbol on top of our jet.

17:58.328 --> 18:01.206
Yeah. Sometimes I can't help myself
with the cool.

18:09.339 --> 18:13.093
You're certain about this?
It does say "death by punishment."

18:16.430 --> 18:17.639
After you.

18:32.488 --> 18:34.948
Let me guess,
Joey Gutierrez is unfit for action.

18:35.032 --> 18:37.534
Physically, psychologically
and emotionally.

18:37.618 --> 18:40.913
The man can't open a doorknob
without melting it.

18:40.996 --> 18:43.874
My Psych 101 students could tell you
he's not ready.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.043
Maybe, in time.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.212
We are running out of time.

18:48.295 --> 18:51.131
Things keep coming at us.
It's like punching a waterfall.

18:51.215 --> 18:52.883
New Inhumans. The ATCU.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.968
And this... This new guy,
you should have seen him.

18:55.052 --> 18:56.428
It was a whole new level.

18:56.512 --> 18:59.348
You want to fight fire with fire.
I get it.

18:59.431 --> 19:00.557
But you can't be reckless about it.

19:00.641 --> 19:04.436
All these people who transform
have the potential to turn into monsters.

19:04.520 --> 19:07.356
But the team you do have
has that danger as well.

19:07.439 --> 19:09.274
Sounds like
there's some sage advice coming.

19:09.358 --> 19:11.485
Everywhere you turn, fires are burning.

19:11.568 --> 19:13.779
Coulson's desperate to win
on any front,

19:13.862 --> 19:17.199
but desperation leads to mistakes.

19:17.282 --> 19:19.785
Giving Hunter carte blanche
to get payback.

19:19.868 --> 19:23.121
Letting Fitz try to open a portal
to save one life.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.790
These are questionable decisions.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.375
Then you should be telling him that.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.585
He doesn't want to hear it
right now. He's...

19:28.669 --> 19:30.420
He is who he is.

19:30.504 --> 19:32.172
But you, you're still changing.

19:32.256 --> 19:34.258
You see something I don't?

19:34.341 --> 19:35.884
Horns?

19:36.677 --> 19:38.554
You're turning into a leader.

19:38.637 --> 19:41.473
And I'm concerned about
how you're handling the adjustment.

19:41.598 --> 19:42.683
Wow.

19:42.891 --> 19:45.394
I totally just gave you permission
to analyse me, didn't I?

19:45.477 --> 19:47.437
You are on a couch.

19:47.521 --> 19:52.359
Look, you're laser-focused
on finding members for this team.

19:52.442 --> 19:54.862
I understand the need
for these Secret Warriors, but...

19:54.945 --> 19:56.989
No, it's more than that.

19:57.072 --> 20:00.075
When I changed, I felt like a monster.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.243
I needed help.

20:01.326 --> 20:04.454
This is a chance to show people
they have a place to belong.

20:05.581 --> 20:08.083
It sounds stupid.

20:08.166 --> 20:12.129
No, but what you're describing
sounds more like a halfway house,

20:12.212 --> 20:13.463
I'll gladly help you build that.

20:13.547 --> 20:17.217
My mother created a halfway house
for Inhumans, and it was not enough.

20:17.301 --> 20:20.721
I want Inhumans
taking action with S.H.I.E.L.D.

20:20.804 --> 20:24.433
to see that being different
can mean making a difference.

20:30.564 --> 20:31.732
Whoa.

20:32.441 --> 20:34.067
You chop like your mother.

20:34.151 --> 20:38.280
I think she chopped her vegetables
like that as a warning to me.

20:39.531 --> 20:41.491
"Stay in line, old man."

20:42.159 --> 20:44.161
You left the kitchen window open again.

20:44.244 --> 20:48.165
Paranoid, a quality
you share with your mother.

20:48.749 --> 20:50.042
You see her much?

20:50.125 --> 20:54.504
Mmm, she calls me now and then
to see if I'm still living.

20:55.964 --> 20:58.425
You haven't called anybody yourself.

20:58.508 --> 20:59.968
Are you in hiding?

21:02.137 --> 21:04.806
Come on over,
I want to show you something.

21:04.890 --> 21:07.768
I found it while I was downsizing.

21:10.354 --> 21:12.105
- Ta-da!
- Oh, my God.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.901
You put on skates at seven years old,

21:15.984 --> 21:19.655
and you didn't take them off
until five years later.

21:19.738 --> 21:20.864
A natural.

21:20.948 --> 21:23.241
I was obsessed with Dorothy Hamill.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.618
I remember that well.

21:24.701 --> 21:28.121
Mostly, I remember
how hard the ice was when I'd fall.

21:28.205 --> 21:30.123
Over and over.

21:30.207 --> 21:31.833
That's why I switched to martial arts.

21:32.626 --> 21:34.086
Padded floors.

21:34.169 --> 21:36.088
Well, and you could hit people.

21:39.091 --> 21:40.801
- You expecting company?
- No.

21:40.884 --> 21:43.095
But I'm not afraid of the prospect.

21:51.853 --> 21:53.897
What the hell are you doing here?

21:54.314 --> 21:56.233
Uh, neighbourhood watch?

22:09.705 --> 22:10.747
Okay.

22:10.831 --> 22:13.041
Well, this room wasn't on the last tour.

22:13.959 --> 22:16.712
It's an odd shape for architecture
of this period.

22:16.795 --> 22:18.630
Definitely built after I was here.

22:18.714 --> 22:20.549
Reminds me of the bunker
under the Louvre.

22:21.508 --> 22:24.469
What? There's no bunker
under the Louvre.

22:24.553 --> 22:26.888
That's a joke, right?

22:26.972 --> 22:29.558
You're messing with me.

22:29.641 --> 22:32.352
All right, great, now I'll have to check.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.108
It's late 1800s.

22:42.863 --> 22:44.406
Still got some life to it.

22:46.408 --> 22:48.410
I hear water.

22:48.493 --> 22:51.747
Could be a stream underground,
maybe hydroelectric power.

23:04.301 --> 23:05.802
This looks a lot like
it was made to hold...

23:05.886 --> 23:06.970
The Monolith.

23:07.054 --> 23:09.306
This machine was designed
to control the portal.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.391
To open and close it at will.

23:11.475 --> 23:13.143
Do you know that?

23:13.226 --> 23:15.520
Or is that just what you hope it to be?

23:15.604 --> 23:17.606
Well, there's only one way to find out.

23:22.486 --> 23:26.323
Mack, I need you to load something
onto Zephyr One and bring it to us.

23:26.406 --> 23:27.574
<i>What exactly am I bringing, sir?</i>

23:27.657 --> 23:28.742
Yeah,

23:29.534 --> 23:31.078
you're not gonna like it.

23:33.872 --> 23:36.458
You never earned
a single thing in your life.

23:36.541 --> 23:38.585
You're wasting your family money.

23:40.796 --> 23:41.922
So we're taking everything.

23:43.048 --> 23:45.509
Starting with banking passwords.

23:46.134 --> 23:47.886
Go screw...

23:49.554 --> 23:51.223
I'm not asking.

23:51.306 --> 23:54.101
From here on out,
you want something, you earn it.

23:56.228 --> 23:59.731
Teeth, eyes, fingers, whatever it takes,

24:00.899 --> 24:02.234
get the passwords.

24:12.077 --> 24:15.705
A lot of speculation back at HQ
as to why you went AWOL.

24:15.789 --> 24:17.040
Spiritual walkabout.

24:17.124 --> 24:18.667
Mid-life crisis.

24:18.750 --> 24:21.795
Early mid-life crisis.

24:21.878 --> 24:26.341
I know you didn't elope with your ex,
'cause he's actually been around.

24:26.424 --> 24:29.344
Hawaiian islands
couldn't rekindle that old flame, eh?

24:32.806 --> 24:34.099
You heard about Simmons.

24:35.350 --> 24:36.977
Coulson and I spoke on the phone.

24:37.060 --> 24:38.645
I know. We traced it.

24:38.728 --> 24:40.856
Payphone at LAX,
one of the surviving few.

24:40.939 --> 24:42.190
How did you find me?

24:42.274 --> 24:46.862
I've been reaching out to
some of my less savoury associates.

24:46.945 --> 24:48.864
Trying to dig up anything I can
on HYDRA.

24:48.947 --> 24:51.908
My mate in Leavenworth said
that he'd received an anonymous call

24:51.992 --> 24:54.327
from a woman asking
the same questions.

24:54.411 --> 24:57.038
Payphone again. Careless.

24:57.122 --> 25:00.458
You do know that only 0.3%
of the population of Sun City are Asian?

25:00.542 --> 25:01.668
What do you want?

25:01.751 --> 25:02.794
Your skills.

25:04.254 --> 25:06.464
I plan to put Ward six feet underground.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.508
At the least.

25:08.592 --> 25:10.552
Your help would be appreciated.

25:10.635 --> 25:13.180
I'm out. My father needs me.

25:13.263 --> 25:17.309
Oh, yeah, car accident. Broke his hip.

25:17.392 --> 25:19.936
Police called it a hit-and-run.

25:20.020 --> 25:22.397
Looks like Mr May is doing okay to me.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.441
He's getting there.

25:24.524 --> 25:26.443
But they never found the driver.

25:26.526 --> 25:27.861
It was an accident,

25:27.944 --> 25:29.905
and I'm here to help him
get back on his feet.

25:29.988 --> 25:31.031
Yeah?

25:31.114 --> 25:34.075
Is that why you nearly decapitated me
for dropping by?

25:34.159 --> 25:36.494
Why you're making anonymous calls
to old CIs?

25:38.538 --> 25:42.125
Part of you wonders if it was Ward
going after the people you care about.

25:42.209 --> 25:43.501
We both know he's capable of it.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.086
And unless I'm off the mark,

25:45.170 --> 25:47.923
he is out there pumping new life
into HYDRA.

25:48.006 --> 25:49.966
And we both know
where they'll come knocking first.

25:50.050 --> 25:51.927
- What's your way in?
- From below.

25:52.010 --> 25:53.845
Climb the ranks.
Hail HYDRA and all that.

25:53.929 --> 25:55.430
He sees your face, you're made.

25:55.513 --> 25:56.973
If he's close enough to see my face,

25:57.057 --> 25:59.434
then I'm close enough
to put a bullet in his.

26:03.521 --> 26:04.814
I'm out.

26:08.735 --> 26:12.447
I'm gonna nab a payload from these
gunrunners to establish my cover.

26:13.448 --> 26:16.076
If you change your mind...

26:18.453 --> 26:19.955
Whatever your reason,

26:20.038 --> 26:22.832
you can never truly be out if you're
always looking over your shoulder.

26:22.916 --> 26:25.543
And next time
it won't be me outside the window.

26:52.570 --> 26:54.531
Zephyr One, you're clear to retract.

26:56.074 --> 26:58.368
Wow. A room full of ancient Gak.

26:58.451 --> 27:01.079
Kind of reminds me
of your office, Director.

27:01.162 --> 27:03.623
Realistically, what are the odds
of this thing working?

27:03.707 --> 27:06.209
If we were realistic,
we'd never have gotten this far.

27:06.293 --> 27:08.378
Well, Andrew Garner thinks
I need to be more so.

27:08.461 --> 27:10.547
He recommended three months'
observation and counselling

27:10.630 --> 27:11.673
before reassessment for Joey.

27:11.756 --> 27:13.049
Says I'm reckless.

27:13.133 --> 27:14.592
Don't take it personally.
He probably just meant...

27:14.676 --> 27:15.760
He said you're desperate.

27:15.844 --> 27:18.847
What? He didn't say that.

27:18.930 --> 27:19.973
Did he say that?

27:20.056 --> 27:21.641
Let me guess.

27:21.725 --> 27:24.311
I'm struggling to come to terms
with physical limitations

27:24.394 --> 27:26.688
and losing my sense of self
instead of redefining it.

27:26.771 --> 27:28.106
No, he didn't mention you.

27:28.189 --> 27:29.274
Oh.

27:29.357 --> 27:30.567
Oh, he did, that's what he said.

27:30.650 --> 27:31.693
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

27:31.776 --> 27:34.821
Mack? Mack, push that lever.

27:34.904 --> 27:36.239
No, the one... The one with the stone...

27:36.323 --> 27:37.574
The one beside it, push it.

28:07.103 --> 28:08.146
Everybody, stay clear.

28:08.229 --> 28:09.564
Fitz, it's working!

28:14.027 --> 28:16.237
It's staying open! Light.
I need more light!

28:25.914 --> 28:27.540
We've got a problem!

28:27.624 --> 28:28.917
I need some bloody light!

28:29.000 --> 28:30.085
Fitz!

28:39.177 --> 28:40.970
The gears have locked! Bobbi!

29:01.866 --> 29:03.660
Skye... Hey.

29:03.743 --> 29:05.662
Skye, are you okay?

29:05.745 --> 29:06.955
Skye?

29:07.038 --> 29:08.498
It's Daisy.

29:08.581 --> 29:09.791
What?

29:09.874 --> 29:12.001
It's Daisy now, sir.

29:12.085 --> 29:13.253
You're really having
a hard time with this, huh?

29:13.336 --> 29:16.214
Damn it. Yeah, Daisy.
Hey, are you all right?

29:16.297 --> 29:18.216
Yeah. I'm better.

29:19.717 --> 29:21.511
That pulsing sound was killing me.

29:22.554 --> 29:23.847
What pulsing sound?

29:23.930 --> 29:25.598
Are you serious? It was deafening.

29:27.767 --> 29:30.311
Slow down, slow down. Slow down.

29:30.395 --> 29:31.646
It holds the portal open.

29:31.729 --> 29:32.981
That flare shot straight through.

29:33.064 --> 29:35.400
If we can send a hard-wired probe
through, we can see the other side.

29:35.483 --> 29:36.985
- We can find her!
- We'll fix the machine.

29:37.068 --> 29:40.029
- We have to fix it.
- But you've got to chill.

29:40.113 --> 29:43.283
How are we supposed to fix a machine
when we don't know how it works?

29:46.077 --> 29:47.579
I figured you for a mama's boy.

29:47.662 --> 29:50.748
One slap and you'd spit out the info.

29:50.915 --> 29:52.500
It's been a good run, kid,

29:52.584 --> 29:55.462
now, let's just skip to the end.

29:58.965 --> 30:00.133
Come on.

30:02.510 --> 30:04.637
Okay, you win.

30:09.684 --> 30:11.769
Nobody treats me like that and lives.

30:12.896 --> 30:14.105
Ah!

30:16.566 --> 30:18.943
Do you even know
who the hell I am? Do you?

30:19.569 --> 30:21.988
You're Werner Von Strucker.

30:22.071 --> 30:26.284
Your father was
Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker.

30:26.367 --> 30:28.203
One of HYDRA's greatest leaders.

30:29.204 --> 30:31.831
A powerful family name
doesn't mean you deserve respect.

30:32.874 --> 30:34.501
You earn that.

30:36.294 --> 30:37.837
I wondered if you had it in you.

30:39.756 --> 30:42.550
Your old man would be proud.

30:43.551 --> 30:44.594
Come on.

30:45.803 --> 30:46.846
I brought tacos.

30:54.687 --> 30:56.356
Unfinished business?

30:57.982 --> 30:59.943
Is that what you're hiding from?

31:03.655 --> 31:05.532
You and your mother.

31:05.615 --> 31:08.535
Silence always means yes.

31:09.494 --> 31:12.205
You take after her in that way.

31:12.288 --> 31:14.499
In every way.

31:14.582 --> 31:18.169
So that's what this visit is all about?

31:18.253 --> 31:21.130
Things with you and Andrew
did not work out so well,

31:21.214 --> 31:23.550
so you feel damaged in some way.

31:23.633 --> 31:27.345
But there are worse things to be
than your mother's daughter.

31:29.847 --> 31:31.933
I just want to have a normal life, Dad.

31:32.016 --> 31:33.434
Away from S.H.I.E.L.D.

31:34.644 --> 31:36.229
I want to see if I can.

31:36.312 --> 31:37.814
Normal?

31:37.897 --> 31:40.483
With a handgun in your golf bag?

31:40.567 --> 31:43.403
And trying to protect me
from some unfinished business

31:43.486 --> 31:46.281
that follows you like a shadow?

31:55.498 --> 31:58.835
You remember the pain
when you hit the ice,

31:58.918 --> 32:02.839
but I always remember
how quickly you would get up.

32:02.922 --> 32:04.424
I was a kid.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.385
It didn't hurt as much then.

32:13.558 --> 32:16.185
My daughter always got back up.

32:30.366 --> 32:34.746
You needed a push.
I had to know you could handle the fall.

32:34.829 --> 32:36.581
I should have you killed.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.083
Okay, first thing.

32:39.167 --> 32:42.211
If you're going to kill someone,
don't threaten them, just do it.

32:42.295 --> 32:43.671
Oh, my father would have you...

32:43.755 --> 32:47.634
Your father kept you in the dark
and then died a meaningless death.

32:47.717 --> 32:49.802
Leaving you to hide your face
with no answers.

32:50.511 --> 32:53.306
I know what it's like
to come from a complicated family.

32:55.183 --> 32:57.769
HYDRA's fractured, in pieces.

32:58.936 --> 33:01.397
We're going to rebuild it the right way.

33:03.358 --> 33:04.651
By force.

33:07.153 --> 33:10.406
My father so rarely
let me see any of his world.

33:10.490 --> 33:12.575
It's your world now.

33:12.659 --> 33:15.078
And when we put these pieces
back together,

33:15.161 --> 33:17.538
they'll be stronger than the original.

33:17.622 --> 33:20.833
It'll just rattle apart again.
We have to reinforce the connections.

33:20.917 --> 33:21.959
Reinforce?

33:22.043 --> 33:24.003
Look, most of the workings
are under the ground.

33:24.087 --> 33:25.963
We just can't tear the castle down.

33:26.047 --> 33:27.840
And actually, we're lucky
the room is shaped this way,

33:27.924 --> 33:31.177
or the machine might have
shaken apart on top of us.

33:31.260 --> 33:32.345
Wait.

33:33.054 --> 33:34.931
Wait, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's the point.

33:35.014 --> 33:38.393
Quantum harmonic oscillation theory,
like the professor said.

33:38.476 --> 33:39.519
I know that look.

33:39.602 --> 33:41.688
It's a strange shape for this time period

33:41.771 --> 33:43.314
because it's made to resonate,

33:43.398 --> 33:46.776
to create a quantised field
within the stone.

33:46.859 --> 33:48.861
Fitz, you're talking,
but we're not totally following.

33:48.945 --> 33:51.864
The room is a speaker,
the machine is an amplifier.

33:52.073 --> 33:56.035
Uh, a sub-sonic frequency,
to resonate with the Monolith.

33:56.119 --> 33:57.787
You're saying you figured out
a way to fix the machine?

33:59.497 --> 34:02.166
No, I'm saying I've figured out...

34:02.250 --> 34:04.293
We don't have to.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.591
I can do it.

34:10.675 --> 34:12.510
I can open the portal myself.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.476
Well, it turns out we're
standing in the middle

34:20.560 --> 34:22.853
of the world's largest sub-woofer.

34:22.937 --> 34:24.272
Yeah.

34:25.565 --> 34:27.817
If the point of the machine was to
resonate the room

34:27.900 --> 34:29.777
at a certain frequency, I can do that.

34:29.860 --> 34:30.987
And you can replicate it?

34:31.070 --> 34:32.487
Kind of drilled into my brain.

34:32.572 --> 34:34.322
And it could kill you.

34:34.407 --> 34:35.658
How long do you think you can hold it?

34:35.742 --> 34:37.034
Maybe a minute.

34:37.118 --> 34:40.163
If it's too much, you pull back.
I can't lose you too.

34:40.246 --> 34:41.956
I got this.

34:42.956 --> 34:44.542
Here we go.

34:44.625 --> 34:47.170
Camera and data sensors are
hard-lined back to us through a cable.

34:47.253 --> 34:49.005
No signal loss that way.

34:49.088 --> 34:51.757
If Daisy can hold it,
we'll get a visual of the other side.

34:51.841 --> 34:53.259
That's what we're looking for.

34:53.342 --> 34:56.012
All right, you listen to me.
You take care of yourself.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.805
We lose that probe, nobody cares.

34:57.889 --> 34:59.724
Uh, I'm confused.

34:59.807 --> 35:02.393
What exactly
is she planning to do here?

35:17.283 --> 35:19.786
Sorry, still tuning.

35:40.515 --> 35:41.808
Hold it open as long as you can.

35:44.560 --> 35:45.853
Fitz, no!

36:01.160 --> 36:02.245
Jemma!

36:05.206 --> 36:06.833
Jemma!

36:21.180 --> 36:22.306
Jemma!

36:24.851 --> 36:26.185
Jemma!

36:27.061 --> 36:28.229
Fitz!

36:28.813 --> 36:30.690
- Fitz!
- Jemma?

36:43.411 --> 36:44.537
Jemma?

36:52.420 --> 36:53.588
Jemma!

36:53.671 --> 36:54.714
Oh!

36:54.964 --> 36:56.048
Fitz!

37:10.104 --> 37:12.106
Damn it, pull him back!
Get him back here.

37:19.363 --> 37:20.531
No!

37:47.767 --> 37:49.352
I can't hold it!

38:52.665 --> 38:54.750
You did good, Tremors.

38:54.834 --> 38:55.960
You did good.

39:01.298 --> 39:02.508
Fitz...

39:13.686 --> 39:16.772
No sign of radiation
or infection.

39:16.856 --> 39:20.067
Fitz would never have found her,
but she saw the flare.

39:20.151 --> 39:21.986
We brought a woman back
from the dead today.

39:22.945 --> 39:25.364
And happily you kept up
your end of the bargain.

39:25.448 --> 39:26.532
The portal is destroyed.

39:26.615 --> 39:27.742
Thank Daisy for that.

39:27.825 --> 39:28.909
Yeah.

39:30.411 --> 39:31.954
Agent Coulson,

39:33.998 --> 39:36.208
what exactly is Daisy?

39:37.209 --> 39:38.794
They call themselves Inhumans.

39:41.964 --> 39:46.052
I have not heard that word
in a very long time.

40:00.608 --> 40:01.692
Yes?

40:01.776 --> 40:04.445
Your team pulled off a miracle today.

40:04.528 --> 40:05.988
Fitz got Simmons back.

40:06.447 --> 40:09.033
<i>I thought you deserved to know.</i>

40:09.116 --> 40:10.534
They think she's going to be okay.

40:10.618 --> 40:12.828
If you wanna come back and see her,

40:12.912 --> 40:14.622
or stay,

40:14.705 --> 40:17.166
<i>I think headquarters is
big enough for the two of us.</i>

40:19.085 --> 40:20.795
I'm glad she's safe.

40:27.468 --> 40:28.594
Simmons is back.

40:29.178 --> 40:30.513
She's okay.

40:30.596 --> 40:33.432
Are you serious? She's alive?

40:33.516 --> 40:36.769
Fitz, you absolute beauty!

40:36.852 --> 40:38.562
Come on. Beers?
Let's get beers in, then.

40:39.063 --> 40:41.023
Come on, mate.
Smile for once in your life.

41:33.909 --> 41:36.036
- First thing tomorrow morning, all right?
- Dr Garner?

41:36.120 --> 41:37.204
Yeah. Yeah.

41:37.288 --> 41:40.207
I'm sorry for the intrusion,
but I was hoping to add your class.

41:40.291 --> 41:42.042
You okay with a few weeks'
makeup work?

41:42.126 --> 41:43.544
Yeah. I just transferred.

41:43.627 --> 41:45.754
I think psychology might be my major.

41:45.838 --> 41:49.216
Okay. You know why most people
take Psych, right?

41:49.967 --> 41:52.970
Ah, damn this pen.
Here, give me your back.

41:54.013 --> 41:56.015
They're trying to
figure out their families.

41:58.350 --> 42:00.019
You got me there.

42:01.687 --> 42:04.273
You wouldn't believe
how messed up mine is.
