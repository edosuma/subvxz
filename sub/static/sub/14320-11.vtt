01:06.375 --> 01:08.458
MOIRA:
Try to remember, Jean.

01:08.458 --> 01:11.166
You were possessed
by the Phoenix.

01:11.166 --> 01:14.750
You took the M'Kraan Crystal
into the sun.

01:14.750 --> 01:18.458
What happened
to you, Jean,
inside the sun?

01:18.458 --> 01:20.458
Why hasn't
the Phoenix left you?

01:20.458 --> 01:22.125
(SCREAMS)

01:22.708 --> 01:25.833
Jean, it's Charles.
You're going
to be all right.

01:25.833 --> 01:28.208
We are here
with you on Muir Island.

01:28.208 --> 01:30.458
PHOENIX: So am I.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.000
Phoenix, why do you still
inhabit Jean's body?
Your work is done.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
You do her harm by remaining!

01:35.000 --> 01:36.833
(PHOENIX LAUGHING EVILLY)

(GROANING)

01:53.458 --> 01:58.500
MOIRA: I'm sorry, Charles.
I've done all I know
to do for her.

01:59.125 --> 02:04.500
The psycho-neural therapy
calms her, but the
root problem remains.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.625
It's time
to take her home.

02:09.291 --> 02:10.708
Help me, Scott.

02:12.458 --> 02:14.291
(UPBEAT SONG PLAYING)

02:19.000 --> 02:23.250
Hey, Cyke, loosen up.
How about
that Dazzler, huh?

02:23.250 --> 02:25.583
Didn't I tell you
she's something?

02:33.500 --> 02:34.625
Help me, Scott.

02:34.625 --> 02:35.833
(GROANING)

02:35.833 --> 02:36.958
What's wrong?

02:36.958 --> 02:38.583
It's Jean.

02:38.583 --> 02:40.625
I can feel it.
She needs my help.

02:40.625 --> 02:42.458
I have to put in a call
to Muir Island.

02:42.458 --> 02:44.250
It's all
in your head.

02:44.250 --> 02:47.458
If there was trouble,
Xavier'd
be contacting us.

02:47.458 --> 02:51.833
You've been worrying
too hard about Jean.
You need to relax.

02:51.833 --> 02:54.416
You're probably right,
but I need to be sure.

02:54.416 --> 02:57.000
Go back and enjoy
the rest of the show.

02:59.708 --> 03:01.583
PIERCE: There she is!
Grab her!

03:01.583 --> 03:04.583
(GRUNTING)
Let go of me!

03:04.583 --> 03:06.708
Get her in the car!
Hurry!

03:08.708 --> 03:10.458
Hands off the lady.

03:12.708 --> 03:14.250
Meddling fool!

03:16.458 --> 03:17.708
Don't you know
who you're dealing with?

03:17.708 --> 03:18.875
(WHIRRING)

03:18.875 --> 03:20.583
No, should I?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.333
Whoa!

03:28.708 --> 03:30.458
Not bad shooting.

03:31.708 --> 03:33.458
But not good enough!

03:36.708 --> 03:37.750
Goodbye!

03:37.750 --> 03:39.000
(EXCLAIMS)

03:39.750 --> 03:41.083
I'm blind!

03:42.833 --> 03:44.166
Are you all right?

03:44.166 --> 03:45.875
I'm fine.

03:45.875 --> 03:47.833
Thank you
for saving me.

03:47.833 --> 03:48.875
I should be thanking you.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

03:52.833 --> 03:54.583
Who was he?

03:54.583 --> 03:57.875
Some big shot
who won't take
no for an answer.

03:57.875 --> 03:59.958
I hope you'll be here
tomorrow night,

03:59.958 --> 04:01.500
in case
they come back.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.000
Well, I...

04:03.000 --> 04:05.500
Looks like my car
has seen better days.

04:05.500 --> 04:08.958
I would like to
talk to you about
your mutant powers.

04:08.958 --> 04:11.708
Tomorrow night then.
It's a date.

04:12.583 --> 04:16.166
Where's that blasted salami?
I can smell it!

04:16.708 --> 04:17.750
Ah!

04:17.750 --> 04:19.875
All it needs is slicing!

04:21.375 --> 04:23.750
While you're at it,
fix one for me.

04:23.750 --> 04:26.000
(EXCLAIMS
APPRECIATIVELY)

04:26.000 --> 04:29.458
Looks like you've been
having fun without me.
Where's the Cajun?

04:29.458 --> 04:31.500
He's still back
at the club.

04:33.291 --> 04:35.458
I met an interesting woman
there, a mutant...

04:35.458 --> 04:38.875
Save it. I must be
seeing things!

04:38.875 --> 04:40.166
Jean!

04:43.625 --> 04:46.208
I...
How are you?

04:46.208 --> 04:49.625
The therapy helped.
I'm better.

04:49.625 --> 04:52.708
Scott, the trip
has tired her.

04:52.708 --> 04:55.291
Jean will be better
after some rest.

04:55.291 --> 04:58.500
Storm, will you
take her back
to her room?

04:58.500 --> 05:01.625
Professor Xavier
is right, Jean.

05:01.625 --> 05:05.000
You and Scott
can have a long talk
in the morning.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.125
Jean seems
so distant, Professor.
What can I do?

05:09.125 --> 05:12.375
All those weeks of therapy
and she still
isn't any better!

05:12.375 --> 05:16.208
The Phoenix
is still inside her,
that's the problem.

05:16.208 --> 05:19.958
Moira thought it best
to continue
her treatment here.

05:19.958 --> 05:22.250
What treatment?
It's hopeless!

05:22.250 --> 05:24.875
How can anyone live possessed
by another being?

05:24.875 --> 05:27.583
Especially one with
the power of the Phoenix!

05:27.583 --> 05:30.875
I will continue to do
what I can, Scott.

05:30.875 --> 05:34.458
But if Jean is to have
any chance of survival,

05:34.458 --> 05:37.708
she needs to
draw strength from you.

05:37.708 --> 05:42.375
Through your unique
psychic rapport,
you may be her only hope.

05:49.708 --> 05:51.875
PIERCE: She was
not right for us.

05:51.875 --> 05:54.375
Through the centuries,
only the most gifted
and the most powerful

05:54.375 --> 05:56.875
have been allowed
to join the Inner Circle!

05:56.875 --> 05:57.958
(SCOFFING)

05:57.958 --> 05:59.833
Excuses!

05:59.833 --> 06:02.958
So, Pierce,
your failure with Dazzler
makes me wonder.

06:02.958 --> 06:06.833
Were you trying to recruit
her for the Inner Circle
or for yourself?

06:06.833 --> 06:08.583
I warned you, Shaw,

06:10.750 --> 06:14.083
not to send a cyborg
to do a man's job.

06:14.958 --> 06:18.208
Being half machine
makes me no less
a man, Leland.

06:19.458 --> 06:21.583
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)

06:22.250 --> 06:26.750
I'll see you never lift
that hand against me again!

06:26.750 --> 06:29.875
Leland! Save it
for our enemies.

06:29.875 --> 06:33.166
You have sworn an oath
of allegiance to this club
and all its members.

06:33.166 --> 06:36.166
Remember it.
As for you, Pierce,

06:36.166 --> 06:39.500
the cost of that crystal
will be added
to next quarter's dues!

06:39.500 --> 06:41.583
Forget Dazzler, Shaw!

06:41.583 --> 06:44.166
A far greater prize
awaits recruitment
to our circle!

06:44.166 --> 06:47.833
My psychic abilities
have discovered a creature
with more power

06:47.833 --> 06:50.416
than even
you can imagine!

06:50.416 --> 06:51.875
(CHUCKLES)

06:51.875 --> 06:53.416
Do tell.

06:53.416 --> 06:56.166
They call her the Phoenix.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.458
She was the guardian
of the fantastically powerful
M'Kraan Crystal.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.875
To protect the crystal,
she inhabited
the body of Jean Grey.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.166
(GROANS)

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
JEAN: I must hold on!

07:32.000 --> 07:35.333
FROST: With her energy focused
by Jean's empathic abilities,

07:35.333 --> 07:39.833
the Phoenix flew
with the crystal into
the burning heart of the sun!

07:39.833 --> 07:41.291
(CAWING)

07:46.208 --> 07:47.958
JEAN: (GASPING) The light!

07:51.083 --> 07:55.333
Oh, Scott, if only
you could see it.

07:56.416 --> 07:59.250
The Phoenix
destroyed herself?

07:59.250 --> 08:01.291
No! It lived!

08:02.458 --> 08:08.083
After depositing the crystal
in the sun, this primal force
returned to Earth.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.416
There, a still-possessed
Jean Grey

08:23.416 --> 08:27.833
was found by
Professor Charles Xavier,
her mentor,

08:27.833 --> 08:29.875
and leader
of the X-Men.

08:42.833 --> 08:47.083
How is it you know
so much about
these matters, Frost?

08:47.083 --> 08:50.000
What is the source
of your information?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.708
Xavier's own computer!

08:53.250 --> 08:56.750
LELAND: (LAUGHS) Impossible!

08:56.750 --> 08:59.125
PIERCE: Leland is right,
for once.

08:59.125 --> 09:03.000
Even your psychic powers
are no match for Xavier.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.125
I wish I could
tell you more.

09:05.125 --> 09:08.291
But the visions I have seen
these past days,

09:08.291 --> 09:11.958
make me feel as if
I'm losing control.

09:11.958 --> 09:15.750
Even I don't know
what they mean.

09:15.750 --> 09:18.083
(MOANING)

09:21.250 --> 09:24.875
Phoenix, now we are one!

09:26.083 --> 09:27.166
(MOANING)

09:28.000 --> 09:30.625
Jean Grey's plight
has put Xavier
under great pressure.

09:30.625 --> 09:35.208
Some sort of transformation
has taken place that
none of us yet understands.

09:36.166 --> 09:37.958
FROST:
He's been distracted.

09:40.125 --> 09:43.458
Until I regain control
of my subconscious,

09:43.458 --> 09:45.583
my orders
cannot be trusted.

09:46.208 --> 09:48.333
FROST: And he's been away
for weeks.

09:48.333 --> 09:52.000
Now, if you'll show me
my quarters, Moira,
I need to rest.

09:52.875 --> 09:55.208
I've not seen him
like this, Sean.

09:55.208 --> 09:57.166
It may be even worse
than he told me!

09:58.875 --> 10:01.208
(YELLING)

10:01.750 --> 10:05.625
You are driving me insane!

10:06.250 --> 10:10.208
Still, it took
great skill to breach
his computer's security

10:10.208 --> 10:12.458
and remain undetected.

10:12.458 --> 10:14.375
Shaw, listen to me.

10:14.375 --> 10:17.208
The Phoenix could be
the source
of limitless power!

10:17.208 --> 10:21.000
Tradition demands
that such power
be wielded by us,

10:23.583 --> 10:25.583
the Inner Circle.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.000
If this Phoenix
is so powerful,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.250
how can she be brought
under our control?

10:31.375 --> 10:33.458
Tell them, Wyngarde.

10:33.458 --> 10:36.875
The Phoenix is only
as strong as the mind
that controls her.

10:36.875 --> 10:40.125
The mind
is the place to attack.

10:40.125 --> 10:42.458
Tell us about
the Phoenix, Jean.

10:42.458 --> 10:46.583
What does she want, now that
the M'Kraan Crystal is safe?

10:46.583 --> 10:49.250
JEAN: Phoenix hungers!

10:49.250 --> 10:51.250
PHOENIX: Yes! I hunger!

10:53.166 --> 10:54.958
CYCLOPS: Professor, help her!

10:56.875 --> 11:00.875
XAVIER: Control her, Jean.
Control the Phoenix!

11:02.250 --> 11:03.500
JEAN: Professor...

11:03.500 --> 11:06.250
Relax, it's over.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.291
Relax.

11:13.875 --> 11:17.625
What is it, Professor?
What did you see
in Jean's mind?

11:17.625 --> 11:21.958
It's not what I saw, Beast.
But what I felt.

11:21.958 --> 11:25.083
Phoenix's mind
is becoming dominant.

11:25.083 --> 11:30.458
There is turmoil,
frustration, anger,
yet an excitement.

11:30.458 --> 11:36.291
Perhaps through Jean's body,
the Phoenix is
experiencing sensations

11:36.291 --> 11:40.583
she has never felt before.
That may be why
she refuses to leave.

11:41.083 --> 11:44.500
The man who tried to
kidnap that mutant
Dazzler might return.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.291
I have to go back
to that club tonight.

11:47.291 --> 11:50.500
You would leave me
to be with another woman?
Go then!

11:50.500 --> 11:53.333
Jean! There is nothing
to be jealous of!

11:53.333 --> 11:56.333
Maybe you'll have to
protect her from me!

11:56.333 --> 11:58.291
You don't mean that.

11:59.166 --> 12:03.708
No, of course not.
But I'm afraid
the Phoenix does.

12:03.708 --> 12:07.000
Don't worry, my darling!
I'll stay a while longer.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.333
We will find a way
to help you.

12:16.125 --> 12:18.250
Hmm?

12:18.250 --> 12:22.000
Cyclops, it's late.
You should be going.
I'll stay with her.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.375
Thank you,
Storm.

12:28.333 --> 12:29.958
I'll be back soon.

12:39.375 --> 12:44.875
She's asleep.
I'm in her mind.
Her defenses are down.

12:44.875 --> 12:46.750
You may now enter.

12:46.750 --> 12:49.000
And once
I'm in her mind,

12:49.000 --> 12:53.583
I can use my power of
illusion to create
whatever reality I choose.

12:53.583 --> 12:58.000
I believe you will find her
very susceptible.

13:00.125 --> 13:01.375
WYNGARDE: Jean.

13:06.416 --> 13:07.833
Jean.

13:10.166 --> 13:11.208
(GASPS)

13:14.833 --> 13:15.958
(PANTING)

13:25.708 --> 13:28.416
This is all wrong!

13:29.458 --> 13:31.416
I don't belong here!

13:31.416 --> 13:35.250
Shh. Darling, you're safe.
That's all that matters.

13:35.250 --> 13:38.833
But this isn't my time,
my world.

13:38.833 --> 13:42.958
Of course it is.
But you're upset.
You nearly drowned.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.416
Rest, my Venus.
All is well now.

13:57.333 --> 13:59.833
You don't remember
stowing aboard my ship,

13:59.833 --> 14:01.875
desperate to
sail to America?

14:01.875 --> 14:03.750
My thoughts
are all jumbled.

14:09.750 --> 14:13.583
I seem to remember
another life,
a strange one,

14:13.583 --> 14:19.125
full of unusual people
who were
somehow my friends.

14:19.125 --> 14:22.166
It was a dream,
nothing more.

14:22.166 --> 14:25.375
Don't you remember
how frightened you were
when I found you?

14:25.375 --> 14:27.458
And I took you
in my arms...

14:27.458 --> 14:31.958
And you told me
how beautiful I looked!
Yes, yes, I do remember!

14:31.958 --> 14:35.625
Don't let those dreams
of another life
trouble you.

14:35.625 --> 14:39.458
Remember, my sweet,
I will always be here
when you wake.

14:42.875 --> 14:44.208
(EXCLAIMS IN ALARM)

14:45.958 --> 14:48.125
What is it, Jean?
A nightmare?

14:48.125 --> 14:50.708
No, just a dream.

14:51.250 --> 14:56.375
It's just that
it felt so real.
I'd love a glass of water.

14:56.375 --> 14:57.458
Could you...

14:57.458 --> 14:58.708
Of course.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.166
It was not enough!

15:12.125 --> 15:14.125
This is a delicate business.

15:14.125 --> 15:18.000
I had to break contact.
Someone began to intrude.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.125
There is one with whom
she has a psychic rapport.

15:21.125 --> 15:25.500
Jean's troubled mind
may reflexively
seek his protection.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.458
In my presence,

15:27.458 --> 15:30.833
she will succumb

16:28.000 --> 16:30.583
Jean Grey is inside.
And I...

16:32.000 --> 16:36.083
That's odd.
Her mood suddenly
shifted dramatically!

16:36.083 --> 16:40.458
That's because her mind
has drifted into my world,
to be with me.

16:41.708 --> 16:46.250
Jean, let me
introduce you to,
to Dazzler.

16:46.250 --> 16:50.250
Who's that?
The inevitable
girlfriend?

16:50.250 --> 16:51.875
Hello, my dear.

16:55.250 --> 16:56.583
Darling.

16:58.125 --> 17:00.875
I don't believe it!

17:00.875 --> 17:03.625
Looks like
ex-girlfriend now.

17:04.958 --> 17:07.166
Something's wrong.
I'm going after them!

Are you sure

this is where
they've taken her,

The nose knows, tough guy.
I don't make mistakes
about Jean.

17:35.875 --> 17:40.166
It still bothers me that
Professor Xavier wasn't able
to find Jean telepathically.

17:40.166 --> 17:42.750
Is her mind altered
beyond recognition?

17:42.750 --> 17:45.083
It pains me
to say this, Cyclops,

17:45.083 --> 17:48.458
but perhaps Jean
does not want
to be found.

take Jason as your
lawfully wedded husband,

18:23.083 --> 18:24.875
