CAT: Wow.

00:55.656 --> 00:56.690
GIGI: Kickass, right?
JOHNNY: It's killer.

00:56.723 --> 00:57.724
You were right about the song.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.125
It's really good!

00:59.159 --> 01:00.961
Well, I only got you
into the kitchen,

01:00.994 --> 01:02.195
and you made it cook.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.196
Well, yeah, I made it cook,

01:03.229 --> 01:05.031
but also the band made it cook.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.200
I don't see a single frame
of them in this entire thing.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.201
Yeah.
What happened to all that

01:08.234 --> 01:09.202
performance footage we shot?

01:09.235 --> 01:10.203
I axed it.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.305
very time I cut to them,

01:12.338 --> 01:14.741
they just sucked all the energy
off the screen.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.076
The band's gonna freak
when they find this out.

01:16.109 --> 01:17.377
Yep.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.945
Well,
they probably already know

01:18.979 --> 01:22.315
because I leaked the video
online last night.

01:22.348 --> 01:23.550
‐What?
‐Jesus Christ.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.886
Why? Why did you do that?

01:25.919 --> 01:28.955
Because you don't
sit on something this good.

01:28.989 --> 01:31.658
I mean, the goal is
to get you a deal, right?

01:31.692 --> 01:33.426
Be fielding offers?

01:33.459 --> 01:35.461
Well, I already got an email

01:35.495 --> 01:37.463
from Lana Del Rey's
management team.

01:37.497 --> 01:39.099
‐Really?
‐And two texts

01:39.132 --> 01:40.466
from Jay Z's company,

01:40.501 --> 01:42.002
and you can bet
your sweet little ass

01:42.035 --> 01:43.436
he doesn't want you
to babysit Blue Ivy.

01:43.469 --> 01:44.938
‐God damn.
‐Holy shit.

01:44.971 --> 01:46.406
Babe, you are gonna be

01:46.439 --> 01:49.843
the next giant one‐name‐only
female music star,

01:49.876 --> 01:52.312
just like Beyoncé and Adele...

01:52.345 --> 01:53.379
and Beck.

01:55.381 --> 01:58.852
So, basically, you're telling
me I need to fire the band.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.189
Ugh.

02:03.223 --> 02:06.459
But we are selling you,
not the band.

02:06.492 --> 02:08.795
And besides, they've already got
another gig lined up.

02:08.829 --> 02:11.197
They can focus all their
attentions on Ava X.

02:11.231 --> 02:12.599
I don't want to fire the band
right now, okay?

02:12.633 --> 02:14.267
They sound tighter
than they ever have,

02:14.300 --> 02:16.202
and half the reason that video
was as good as it was

02:16.236 --> 02:18.539
is because the band [...]
kicked ass on the track.

02:18.572 --> 02:23.209
But imagine working
with a younger kickass band

02:23.243 --> 02:25.646
that doesn't have any
of that emotional baggage.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.014
I saw this ballsy band
in Cleveland

02:28.048 --> 02:29.015
called The Red Wedding.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.350
I'm bringing them in

02:30.383 --> 02:32.786
to work on your father's
solo project.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.888
They are such good players.

02:34.921 --> 02:37.524
They are way tighter
than The Assassins,

02:37.558 --> 02:39.292
but they're in their 20s,

02:39.325 --> 02:40.994
so their asses are tight too,

02:41.027 --> 02:42.563
and they happen to be gorgeous.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.064
So when I'm up on stage
with them,

02:44.097 --> 02:45.566
everybody's gonna be
watching them, right?

02:45.599 --> 02:47.568
I mean, that's gonna make‐‐

02:47.601 --> 02:50.537
We play our cards right,
everyone's gonna be watching her

02:50.571 --> 02:52.038
sing on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"

02:52.072 --> 02:54.074
while we're kicking it
in the green room

02:54.107 --> 02:57.578
listening to Jay Z's shit
all over Spotify.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.312
Sweetheart, don't stress.

02:59.345 --> 03:01.715
Why don't you
just come to your dad's gig,

03:01.748 --> 03:04.651
you listen to Red Wedding,
and you judge for yourself.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.452
You don't have to fire
anybody yet.

03:08.388 --> 03:09.756

03:09.790 --> 03:11.257
JOHNNY: Who's that?
‐It's Flash.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.392
What's he say?

03:12.425 --> 03:15.061
"[...] you."
Meaning me.

03:15.095 --> 03:17.363
I'm gonna delete him
from my phone.

03:17.397 --> 03:18.932

"Where in the hell
are The Assassins?"

04:13.319 --> 04:15.922
She sends me little dumb hellos

04:15.956 --> 04:18.792
and, you know, whenever she sees
something that pisses her off‐‐

04:18.825 --> 04:21.327
just a couple of old friends,
you know?

04:21.361 --> 04:24.397
No. I don't know.
Is she still married?

04:24.430 --> 04:26.266
She just split
from her third husband.

04:26.299 --> 04:28.068
You know, she's one of the
biggest hedge fund chicks

04:28.101 --> 04:29.670
in the last 20 years.

04:29.703 --> 04:32.105

they get a little threatened

04:32.138 --> 04:33.674
when the wife's
the actual bread winner.

04:33.707 --> 04:36.276
She just texted you all that?

04:36.309 --> 04:37.944
Sometimes we talk
on the phone.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.279
Mm‐hm.

04:39.312 --> 04:41.848
When's the last time
you saw her?

04:41.882 --> 04:43.584
Two years?

04:43.617 --> 04:46.753
When's the last time
you [...] her?

04:46.787 --> 04:48.354
Two years.

04:48.388 --> 04:50.991
I remember how insane you were
for her, Flash.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.626
It was the whole reason
you left The Heathens

04:52.659 --> 04:54.460
when she slept with Johnny,
and I always thought

04:54.494 --> 04:56.429
that you slept with me
to get back at him,

04:56.462 --> 04:59.633
but really, you slept with me
to get back at her, didn't you?

04:59.666 --> 05:02.435
‐Oh, come on.
‐Does she know we're together?

05:02.468 --> 05:04.470
‐Yes.
‐And she's still texting you?

05:04.505 --> 05:06.807
Well, I didn't tell her
that you moved in.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.175
‐Why not?
‐I'm gonna do it right now.

05:09.209 --> 05:10.777
Well, don't do it now.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.547
You should've done it
on your own, Flash.

05:13.580 --> 05:16.550
I turned my whole world
upside down to be with you.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.484
I turned the band upside down.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.153
‐I did too.
‐So why wouldn't you

05:20.186 --> 05:21.722
tell me about her?

05:22.823 --> 05:23.790
Ugh.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.158
You want me to tell you

05:25.191 --> 05:27.160
every time I text
one of my ex‐flames?

05:27.193 --> 05:28.829
Oh, I don't know.
How many ex‐flames

05:28.862 --> 05:30.997
‐are you still in contact with?
‐Only her.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.733
‐Oh. Ha‐ho.
‐It's no big deal.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.467
Yeah.
Oh, no, that's no big deal.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.404

05:38.438 --> 05:39.706
I'm gonna put one in

05:39.740 --> 05:41.174
Where does she live?

05:41.207 --> 05:42.976
What do you want?
Heart? Chrissie Hynde?

05:43.009 --> 05:45.311
Where does she live?

05:45.345 --> 05:46.713
Everywhere.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.549
She's retired. She's loaded.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.517
She flies around the world
in her plane

05:50.551 --> 05:52.085
doing this charity thing
she started

05:52.118 --> 05:54.054
for kids in war‐torn countries,

05:54.087 --> 05:55.856
African places like Chab.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.991
You mean Chad.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.994
A country called Chad?
No. It's Chab. All right?

06:01.027 --> 06:04.264
Cat Stevens had a peace train.
She's got a peace jet.

06:04.297 --> 06:05.566
And let me guess.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.568
She's in New York right now,
huh?

06:07.601 --> 06:09.335
‐Yeah.
‐Yeah.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.771
Oh, and when were you gonna
see her?

06:10.804 --> 06:12.939
‐Well, I'm not now.
‐No, not now. No.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.240
We were gonna have coffee.

06:14.274 --> 06:16.109
Yeah, you were gonna
do coffee. Right.

06:16.142 --> 06:17.443
She doesn't even know
where I live.

06:17.477 --> 06:18.779
No, doesn't know
where you live.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.346
She doesn't know
where we live.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.516
Why don't you go ahead
and text her your address,

06:22.549 --> 06:25.351
'cause you have her number,
don't you?

06:25.385 --> 06:27.921

she's running

10:04.137 --> 10:05.639
from a couple of Ohio banks.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.841
‐Really?
‐Yeah.

10:09.342 --> 10:12.178
Hmm. Interesting.

10:13.379 --> 10:15.348
That doesn't bother you?

10:15.381 --> 10:17.450
Doesn't change
how I feel about Cat.

10:17.483 --> 10:19.319
Well, that's not
why I'm showing it to you.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.788
So you what‐‐
you came down to warn Gigi?

10:21.822 --> 10:23.356
Yeah, that's exactly why.

10:23.389 --> 10:24.791
And that's why you
showed it to me first?

10:24.825 --> 10:26.092
Johnny, listen.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.694
I don't want things to get
out of hand,

10:27.728 --> 10:29.029
so I just thought that you and I
could have a conversation.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.463
Ava, Ava, Ava.
Ava.

10:30.496 --> 10:32.032
Things are already
way out of hand, okay?

10:32.065 --> 10:34.167
And I'm not blaming anybody.
I'm just saying

10:34.200 --> 10:36.436
you made your choices‐‐
I made mine.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.071
All right?
I'm not breaking up with Cat.

10:39.573 --> 10:43.443
Because you're
in love with her now?

10:43.476 --> 10:45.011
I don't know.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.647
I actually don't know
what's gonna happen.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.649
But I do know one thing.

10:50.183 --> 10:53.319
Between you and me,
just like the song says,

10:53.353 --> 10:54.821
it's over.

10:56.422 --> 10:58.859
I guess those god damn
Micki maracas

10:58.892 --> 11:00.961
weren't so lucky after all.

11:00.994 --> 11:08.001
♪ ♪

11:12.673 --> 11:14.340
So what did you guys think?

11:14.374 --> 11:16.042
They're hot, right?

11:16.076 --> 11:18.144
Yeah, they are!
Especially the lead guitarist.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.580
He is absurdly handsome.

11:19.613 --> 11:22.015
‐I wasn't asking you, Noah.
‐Oh.

11:22.048 --> 11:24.050
Yeah, they're cute
and they're cool,

11:24.084 --> 11:25.151
‐but they're young.
‐Yeah.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.486
And they're new, like me.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.154
I think there's
something to be said

11:28.188 --> 11:30.023
for a group
of experienced musicians

11:30.056 --> 11:32.092
playing behind a singer
that's just starting out.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.159
‐Right.
‐Yeah,

11:33.193 --> 11:34.828
but there is something magical

11:34.861 --> 11:40.000
about three talented,
virile young men on a stage.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.334
‐Marketing‐wise.
‐Right.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.503
(laughs)

11:42.536 --> 11:44.905
So what did you think,
Johnny?

11:44.938 --> 11:47.440
I think we should
probably sleep on it.

11:47.473 --> 11:50.110
‐Yeah.
‐You do?

11:50.143 --> 11:51.144
Yep.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.715
(door slams)
We should sleep on it?

11:54.748 --> 11:56.717
What kind of pussy move is that?

11:56.750 --> 12:00.020
She was impressed by those guys
tonight, you idiot.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.788
You should've pushed her
in the right direction,

12:01.822 --> 12:04.290
but‐‐I don't know‐‐is that
not what you want anymore?

12:04.324 --> 12:05.592
Oh,
it's clearly what you want.

12:05.626 --> 12:07.728
I'm just wondering exactly why.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.897
Oh.
(chuckles)

12:10.931 --> 12:12.398
Let me guess.
Ava.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.867
That's right.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.101
(paper crumbles)

12:16.102 --> 12:17.237
(scoffs)

12:21.474 --> 12:23.476
I ran out of song ideas.

12:23.510 --> 12:26.479
It's like I hit
this huge dry spell,

12:26.513 --> 12:30.316
and I thought it was because I
was so focused on raising Gigi,

12:30.350 --> 12:34.154
but then she left,
and my writer's block got worse,

12:34.187 --> 12:36.923
and the phone stopped ringing,
and the cash stopped flowing.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.992
And what? You just decided
to come to the big city

12:39.025 --> 12:41.094
and use Gigi
to get some more cash to flow?

12:41.127 --> 12:44.665
I came here to use you

12:44.698 --> 12:48.334
to, you know, recharge my...

12:48.368 --> 12:50.971
creative impulses.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.773
And‐‐I don't know.

12:52.806 --> 12:56.176
I think that we are
coming up aces.

12:56.209 --> 13:00.080
I mean, we've written what?
Like three songs already?

13:00.113 --> 13:01.114
Four.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.750
I rest my case.

13:03.784 --> 13:07.287
I took all the cash I had left

13:07.320 --> 13:09.455
and I rolled the dice

13:09.489 --> 13:11.625
on my talented daughter.

13:11.658 --> 13:12.826
Mm.

13:12.859 --> 13:17.698
And her gifted, [...] up,
sexy dad.

13:17.731 --> 13:18.732
Yeah?

13:22.135 --> 13:25.005
I'm all in, Johnny.

13:25.038 --> 13:28.208
‐Financially...
‐Mm‐hm.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.544
And emotionally.
So...

13:31.978 --> 13:33.980
Are you in?

13:34.014 --> 13:34.981
(moans)

13:35.015 --> 13:36.382
Or are you out?

13:36.416 --> 13:37.851
(moans)

13:42.889 --> 13:45.025
No, no.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.560
I'm sorry‐‐

13:46.593 --> 13:49.162
are you turning down
one of my blow jobs?

13:49.195 --> 13:50.664
I know.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.065
I barely believe it myself.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.302
I'm turning into, like,
a responsible dad.

13:56.336 --> 13:59.706
Let me‐‐let me explain, okay?

13:59.740 --> 14:01.207
Emotionally, I'm totally
invested in this kid,

14:01.241 --> 14:02.976
and financially, I was screwed.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.878
So that's why I brought you in.

14:04.911 --> 14:08.649
So I'm a god damn dollar sign?
That is why you called me?

14:08.682 --> 14:09.883
That was a part of it,
but I wanted

14:09.916 --> 14:11.384
to give the relationship
a real shot

14:11.417 --> 14:13.319
because I thought it was
the best thing for Gigi

14:13.353 --> 14:16.056
to have both her parents
together under one roof.

14:16.089 --> 14:19.392
Well, that is one
very expensive god damn roof,

14:19.425 --> 14:21.361
which I [...] paid for.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.196
Okay, listen.
You're taking it the wrong way.

14:23.229 --> 14:24.230
Shut it!

14:31.104 --> 14:33.874
You need to quit
your solo career.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.041
I'm not quitting
my solo career.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.042
‐Mm‐mm.
‐I'm never quitting

14:36.076 --> 14:37.077
my solo career.

14:37.110 --> 14:40.113
We are past our fame due date.

14:40.146 --> 14:41.915
We need to be behind the scenes

14:41.948 --> 14:44.284
figuring out ways
to generate cash

14:44.317 --> 14:47.721
to tide the three of us over
until Gigi gets a deal.

14:47.754 --> 14:52.292
But first, we need to convince
her to fire The Assassins.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.294
And I tried.

14:54.327 --> 14:57.263
I laid out my best guilt trip
on her.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.566
‐And?
‐And nothing.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.034
She laughed at me.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.704
She had no shame
in shooting me down, which‐‐

15:03.737 --> 15:05.205
I don't know.
I wonder who she gets that from.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.040
‐Doesn't get it from me.
‐Pfft.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.209
I could literally never shame
or guilt you into anything.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.477
You were a brick house
when it came to that shit.

15:11.512 --> 15:14.447
Okay, so she got my voice,
my body,

15:14.480 --> 15:16.950
and my steely
Armenian resolve.

15:16.983 --> 15:19.385
‐Mm‐hm.
‐What did she get from you?

15:19.419 --> 15:23.223
I don't know.
That is a good question.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.725
I don't think she got anything
from me,

15:24.758 --> 15:27.093
which is probably a blessing
in disguise, you know?

15:31.364 --> 15:33.734
I'll tell you what she got
from me.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.101
Irish Alzheimer's.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.170
I forget everything
except the grudges, right?

15:37.203 --> 15:40.741
You know what I'm saying?
She's got my black Irish rage.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.142
The night that Flash broke up
with her,

15:42.175 --> 15:43.644
she went back to his apartment

15:43.677 --> 15:45.512
and destroyed 15
of his favorite guitars

15:45.546 --> 15:46.847
with a god damn chainsaw.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.515
And then she came back here
with ice cream.

15:48.549 --> 15:50.684
We had an ice cream party
watching TV together.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.418
It was, like, the happiest
she's been all year.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.155
I'm telling you,
that look she had in her eyes

15:55.188 --> 15:58.091
when she said she was gonna
delete Flash from her phone‐‐

15:58.124 --> 16:00.026
that's the side
we need to nurture.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.328
Just work on the revenge gene.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.830
This is a good approach.

16:03.864 --> 16:05.131
Oh, my God.
I love this approach.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.199
‐Right?
‐Yes.

16:06.232 --> 16:07.200
(together)
Mm‐hm.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.002
(laughs)
Look at you.

16:09.035 --> 16:10.336
You're a proud papa.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.772
Yes, I am.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.640
And you're the concerned
and caring mom.

16:13.674 --> 16:16.009
(laughing)

16:16.042 --> 16:17.010
Okay.
(zipper unzips)

16:17.043 --> 16:19.045
Oh, what are you doing?

16:19.079 --> 16:20.113
I'm ready for the blow job.

16:20.146 --> 16:21.682
No, no, nope.

16:21.715 --> 16:23.984
I'm not in the mood anymore.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.687
But you got me
all revved up here.

16:26.720 --> 16:27.621
I'm ready to go.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.556
I don't do guilt.

16:29.590 --> 16:32.392
And neither does
my entertainment system.

16:32.425 --> 16:35.729
But revenge‐‐
that there gets me hot.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.298
So you know what?

16:38.331 --> 16:40.233
You go get
your daughter's Irish up,

16:40.266 --> 16:42.803
and then, you know,
we'll see what happens.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.338
If she fires the old band,

16:45.371 --> 16:48.241
then your cock is gonna get
all the credit.

16:51.912 --> 16:53.246
I'm gonna go talk to her.

16:59.085 --> 17:02.088
(band checking sound)

17:04.791 --> 17:05.792
(bands stops playing)

17:08.228 --> 17:11.164
GIGI: Hey, guys.

17:11.197 --> 17:12.432
This is my new band,

17:12.465 --> 17:14.067
Red Wedding.

17:14.100 --> 17:15.168
They're from Ohio.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.603
Who the hell are these dudes?

17:19.372 --> 17:20.941
(sighs)

17:20.974 --> 17:24.578
We're what you dudes are
gonna look like in 25 years.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.847
Guys, this is my old band,
The Assassins.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.414
Yeah, old is right.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.617
Hey, which one of you guys shot
President Reagan?

17:30.651 --> 17:32.553
(laughter)

17:32.586 --> 17:34.588
Mommy and Daddy
put you up to this?

17:34.621 --> 17:37.090
No. Actually, this was all me.

17:37.123 --> 17:38.559
I figured inviting them
here today was

17:38.592 --> 17:40.360
cheaper than hiring a shrink.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.728
And am I supposed to believe

17:41.762 --> 17:44.097
you had nothing
to do with this, Cat?

17:44.130 --> 17:46.399
Gigi and I
discussed the idea.

17:46.432 --> 17:48.234
Yes.
But I pulled the trigger.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.904
This is not about you guys.
This is about me.

17:50.937 --> 17:52.706
I need to have a band
that is not carrying around

17:52.739 --> 17:54.641
ancient history
like a god damn chain gang.

17:55.809 --> 17:57.077
Look. It's not a total loss.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.745
You guys can keep
"So Many Miles,"

17:58.779 --> 17:59.780
and you have Ava X.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.917
That's right.
We still got Ava X.

18:03.950 --> 18:06.252
Yeah, and one good song.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.121
(chuckles)

18:08.154 --> 18:11.457
This is on you two.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.226
If you hadn't started
sleeping together,

18:13.259 --> 18:15.161
none of this shit would be
happening to this band.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.462
Mind your own business,
bird face.

18:16.496 --> 18:17.798
‐No, he's right.
‐Why is this‐‐

18:17.831 --> 18:20.100
(overlapping yelling)

18:20.133 --> 18:21.568
‐Why's he right?
‐Because if you guys

18:21.602 --> 18:22.769
just kept your shit together‐‐

18:22.803 --> 18:24.337
Jesus Christ.
Enough!

18:26.139 --> 18:27.941
We have to rehearse.

18:27.974 --> 18:28.975
Thank you.

18:31.277 --> 18:32.378
Okay.

18:34.047 --> 18:35.882
Thank you, guys.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.822
Get off me, man.

18:48.494 --> 18:49.495
(door slams)

18:49.530 --> 18:50.731
(sighs)

18:51.732 --> 18:54.034
Well...

18:54.067 --> 18:55.201
how did that feel?

18:57.704 --> 18:59.640
Fan‐[...]‐tastic.

18:59.673 --> 19:01.207
Oh, high five!

19:01.241 --> 19:03.376
Hey, can we jam now,
or what?

19:03.409 --> 19:04.344
Absolutely.

19:06.146 --> 19:09.115
(band begins playing)

19:09.149 --> 19:11.718
These maracas are not cursed.

19:12.719 --> 19:14.487
They're cursed, Flash.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.322
Okay?
This is how a curse works.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.625
You think everything's great
and lucky and amazing,

19:18.659 --> 19:19.960
and then the next thing
you know,

19:19.993 --> 19:21.562
you're sucked
into Satan's vortex.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.463
Well, we haven't turned
to shit.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.699
Still have your solo career.
Still have each other.

19:25.732 --> 19:28.468
Ha! Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Me, you, and Jojo. Whoo!

19:28.502 --> 19:30.904
I told you Jojo is
out of my phone

19:30.937 --> 19:32.806
and out of my life
forever.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.408
What did I do to my life?

19:35.441 --> 19:36.442
What does that mean?

19:37.944 --> 19:40.346
It means I don't know
how I feel, Flash, okay?

19:40.380 --> 19:42.683
I don't know how I feel.
Damn it.

19:42.716 --> 19:46.687
Okay, I think
that these maracas are cursed,

19:46.720 --> 19:48.154
so I'm gonna break the curse.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.255
(gasps, coughs)

19:49.289 --> 19:51.224
‐Oh, shit.
‐Oh, God.

19:51.257 --> 19:52.726
Are you okay?

19:52.759 --> 19:54.360
I got something in my eye.
Ugh.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.596
Oh, let me see.

19:55.629 --> 19:57.063
I think it's
a piece of maraca.

19:57.097 --> 19:58.765
Oh, God.

19:58.799 --> 20:01.668
Hold still. Hold still.

20:01.702 --> 20:03.269
Hold‐‐okay.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.346
What is it?

20:13.379 --> 20:14.648
I think it's
a little piece of bone.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.118
Bone?

20:18.151 --> 20:19.620
Oh, my God!

20:19.653 --> 20:21.588
Oh, my God.
Oh, shit.

20:21.622 --> 20:23.356
Oh! Ugh!

20:23.389 --> 20:26.059
I'm blind. Help me.

20:27.761 --> 20:29.295
(groans)

20:29.329 --> 20:31.565
‐Stay down, girl.
‐It's not a tooth, right?

20:31.598 --> 20:33.233
It's not a tooth in my eye?

20:33.266 --> 20:35.268
Come on. Help me up.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.437
I see that.

you were blind.
