00:22.561 --> 00:24.431
Ahem.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.160
Yes?

00:29.518 --> 00:31.040
We need to, er...

00:32.345 --> 00:34.355
We need to get to the Louvre.

00:40.294 --> 00:41.344
I'm sorry.

00:46.816 --> 00:49.706
What kind of a Godless brute
robs the Queen of England?

00:50.566 --> 00:52.636
He, he appeared from nowhere, Louis,

00:52.661 --> 00:54.591
masked and cloaked in black.

00:57.374 --> 00:58.955
I tried to stop him.

00:59.274 --> 01:00.682
But he showed no mercy.

01:04.274 --> 01:06.324
He took everything, Louis.

01:07.573 --> 01:08.583
Everything.

01:15.284 --> 01:16.334
Not everything.

01:19.354 --> 01:22.304
I managed to save
your most precious ring.

01:36.294 --> 01:38.294
Right, mount your horses.

01:38.304 --> 01:40.244
You have a thief to catch.

01:40.254 --> 01:41.937
There are only four Musketeers?

01:42.284 --> 01:44.913
He is fast, powerful and dangerous.

01:45.274 --> 01:47.023
This is no ordinary man.

01:50.284 --> 01:53.113
Why would the Queen of England
travel without an escort?

01:53.138 --> 01:54.580
And how are we supposed
to catch this thief?

01:54.605 --> 01:56.274
They didn't even give us
a clear description.

01:56.284 --> 01:58.551
We'll start the search in Saint Antoine.

01:58.777 --> 02:01.078
The most likely place
to sell stolen jewels.

02:01.103 --> 02:04.324
Only an idiot would stay in Paris
after robbing the king's sister.

02:04.334 --> 02:06.906
Two words. Needle, haystack.

02:06.931 --> 02:09.273
I've got two more. Move, now.

02:09.274 --> 02:12.234
I've got two better ones.
Coitus, interruptus.

02:12.244 --> 02:13.884
I heard that.

02:32.684 --> 02:33.733
Porthos?

02:33.758 --> 02:35.024
I know that face.

02:35.049 --> 02:36.334
Now is not the time.

02:37.469 --> 02:39.569
No, no, no, no, I know it too.

02:40.853 --> 02:42.927
- Oh, that is not a good face.
- That's Bonnaire.

02:45.509 --> 02:47.099
Bonnaire!

02:47.473 --> 02:48.474
Come here!

02:49.364 --> 02:50.830
Bonnaire!

02:51.239 --> 02:52.283
Come here!

02:52.308 --> 02:53.822
Stop! Head him off!

02:59.150 --> 03:00.595
Other side! Other side!

03:10.324 --> 03:11.324
Over there!

03:12.318 --> 03:13.772
- Come here!
- Hey!

03:46.939 --> 03:49.514
Musketeers, how lovely
to see you all again.

03:51.139 --> 03:54.304
Emile Bonnaire, my friends,
arisen from the dead.

04:24.645 --> 04:27.345

04:40.659 --> 04:41.668
Diamonds?

04:41.669 --> 04:43.090
Me?

04:43.599 --> 04:46.207
Why and how would
I have come into diamonds?

04:46.325 --> 04:47.629
You ran for a reason.

04:47.699 --> 04:49.345
As any sane fellow would.

04:49.355 --> 04:52.705
The last time our paths crossed,
you threw me on a Spanish prison ship

04:52.730 --> 04:54.752
despite my having
the Cardinal's blessings.

04:54.777 --> 04:56.526
I will throw you off of this building!

04:56.551 --> 04:58.129
Where are the diamonds?

04:58.154 --> 05:00.645
I am sure that there is
a better way to resolve this.

05:00.670 --> 05:03.272
I say, let bygones be bygones.

05:03.297 --> 05:04.327
Drop him.

05:04.352 --> 05:06.749
Oh, the diamonds! You mean the diamonds?

05:06.774 --> 05:09.295
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
now I recall, now I recall.

05:11.415 --> 05:15.205
This weather is enough
to freeze the blood.

05:15.814 --> 05:20.244
Or perhaps it's just that
basilisk stare of yours, Grimaud?

05:20.541 --> 05:22.325
I have bad news.

05:25.485 --> 05:27.355
The Cerberus is lost.

05:27.365 --> 05:28.580
Your ship has sunk.

05:28.605 --> 05:29.675
What?

05:29.855 --> 05:32.355
Wrecked off Corsica.

05:35.776 --> 05:37.058
My cargo?

05:37.667 --> 05:41.375
You promised me a fortune, Grimaud.

05:42.609 --> 05:43.988
I have nothing left.

05:44.013 --> 05:45.125
Nothing!

05:45.395 --> 05:46.967
There will be other ships.

05:46.992 --> 05:48.525
It's too late!

05:49.250 --> 05:52.706
I have invested
everything I have in that cargo!

05:55.948 --> 05:57.088
What is it?

05:57.449 --> 05:59.252
What are you not telling me, Feron?

06:03.842 --> 06:05.470
I have debts to settle.

06:05.698 --> 06:06.921
Help me.

06:16.365 --> 06:18.084
Not now, Georges.

06:18.756 --> 06:21.248
The Queen of England is at the Louvre.

06:21.419 --> 06:23.429
She's been robbed of all her jewels.

06:25.395 --> 06:28.532
London has fallen
to that upstart Cromwell.

06:28.557 --> 06:31.040
Troops loyal to my husband, the king,

06:31.065 --> 06:32.807
stand ready at Oxford.

06:33.264 --> 06:36.414
We need help from France,
Louis, from you.

06:36.627 --> 06:39.385
We need weapons and supplies
to begin the fight back.

06:39.620 --> 06:41.990
I'm afraid, in France,
we are far from immune.

06:42.024 --> 06:44.004
We are protected
by the love of our people.

06:45.433 --> 06:47.373
Without question, Majesty.

06:49.653 --> 06:50.989
Your Majesty,

06:51.600 --> 06:53.630
the Dutch financier is on his way.

06:54.911 --> 06:56.192
What are we to do?

06:56.481 --> 06:59.335
We've nothing to sell him.
The diamonds are all gone.

06:59.345 --> 07:02.355
Perhaps I could intervene on your behalf

07:02.380 --> 07:04.556
with this financier?

07:05.555 --> 07:08.633
Suggest Your Majesty has been delayed.

07:09.203 --> 07:11.535
And who might you be, monsieur?

07:12.246 --> 07:14.627
Henrietta Maria. Surely you
recognise your own brother?

07:14.652 --> 07:15.715
Half-brother.

07:15.982 --> 07:19.472
It's true, I have greatly
changed since last we met.

07:20.315 --> 07:21.514
But Your Majesty

07:22.171 --> 07:26.342
is more beautiful now than she
was on the day she left France.

07:28.385 --> 07:29.545
There.

07:30.239 --> 07:31.989
France comes to England's aid.

07:32.547 --> 07:34.575
Which is more than England
has done against Spain.

07:42.345 --> 07:44.249
You have my gratitude, Philippe.

07:44.694 --> 07:47.116
You may meet the Dutch financier.

07:47.405 --> 07:48.475
Your Majesty.

07:56.681 --> 07:59.257
It must be all of six years since
we last encountered one another.

07:59.282 --> 08:01.515
I think we can safely say that
we have all worn quite well.

08:01.540 --> 08:02.507
The diamonds.

08:02.532 --> 08:04.311
Yes, well, about that.

08:04.336 --> 08:08.310
Look, can I have your word from one
gentleman to another?

08:08.335 --> 08:11.385
You, you're not a gentleman.

08:13.395 --> 08:14.405
No.

08:15.638 --> 08:17.138
But I am gentle.

08:17.786 --> 08:21.044
So from this one gentle man
to you four gentlemen,

08:21.654 --> 08:25.325
can we guarantee that upon receipt
of the desired information,

08:25.350 --> 08:27.460
you're not going to toss me
into the street?

08:30.118 --> 08:32.618
You sold them? Of course you did.

08:34.558 --> 08:36.352
Keep walking, Pauline.

08:37.258 --> 08:38.298
Pauline?

08:41.909 --> 08:43.188
Aramis?

08:46.955 --> 08:48.118
Is that really you?

08:52.201 --> 08:53.221
Pauline?

08:57.709 --> 08:58.709
Aramis.

09:06.345 --> 09:08.168
One day, you will write your memoirs

09:08.193 --> 09:11.073
and there will be
a woman's name on every page.

09:14.375 --> 09:16.375
The money for
the jewels. We'll take that.

09:16.385 --> 09:19.305
I would love to give
you the money, I would,

09:19.315 --> 09:21.190
but sadly, it is not on my person.

09:21.784 --> 09:24.355
My partner, my partner has it, alas.

09:24.365 --> 09:26.603
No, a dog like you has no friends.

09:26.628 --> 09:28.745
Yes, but I didn't say "friends," did I?

09:28.823 --> 09:30.382
Did I? I said "partner."

09:30.407 --> 09:31.785
Yeah. You should, er...

09:31.871 --> 09:33.145
- Porthos?
- No, no, no, no.

09:33.170 --> 09:34.220
Porthos.

09:34.245 --> 09:36.309
We shouldn't upset this man,
I'm disappointed in you.

09:36.334 --> 09:39.298
Look at him, he is the equal
of all four of us combined.

09:39.323 --> 09:41.493
There just really is no
telling what he could do.

09:42.389 --> 09:44.665
Take us to the buyers, quickly.

09:44.847 --> 09:46.747
The Queen of England demands it.

09:47.805 --> 09:49.155
I beg your pardon? Who?

09:49.180 --> 09:50.991
You robbed Louis' sister.

09:51.916 --> 09:52.926
No.

09:56.858 --> 09:58.475
They were royal gems?

09:58.813 --> 10:01.149
Come on. Take us to the diamonds.

10:01.174 --> 10:02.445
All right, all right.

10:03.125 --> 10:04.185
So?

10:05.582 --> 10:07.442
Come on, that woman. Who was she?

10:09.190 --> 10:11.200
Someone from the first page.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.791
You know a Musketeer.

10:17.838 --> 10:19.305
We grew up together.

10:19.782 --> 10:21.562
I haven't seen him for years.

10:21.587 --> 10:23.219
And you never thought to tell me?

10:24.385 --> 10:27.305
A lady must always have secrets.

10:28.270 --> 10:30.515
You'd grow bored of me
if you knew everything.

10:30.962 --> 10:32.293
That could never happen.

10:40.345 --> 10:42.365
Help for an old soldier?

10:45.418 --> 10:46.851
Here.

10:47.195 --> 10:49.056
- Thank you, my lady.
- Pauline.

10:50.445 --> 10:52.335
If we can, we must.

10:56.855 --> 10:58.681
Much further to this buyer?

10:59.435 --> 11:00.618
Not far now.

11:00.907 --> 11:03.118
Anyway, as I was saying,

11:03.516 --> 11:05.375
do you know how long
I was in prison for?

11:05.385 --> 11:07.102
Not long enough.

11:07.190 --> 11:08.370
Five years.

11:09.032 --> 11:12.172
I was tortured, they would
tie my body to the rack,

11:12.633 --> 11:14.821
pull my poor limbs beyond the pale.

11:14.922 --> 11:17.606
And yet, Bonnaire,
you're still the same height.

11:19.215 --> 11:21.723
It just pulls your bones
out of your sockets, actually.

11:22.375 --> 11:26.395
But, before I made my meticulously
planned and daring escape,

11:26.629 --> 11:29.528
I suffered every day because
you would not heed my pardon.

11:29.903 --> 11:31.334
But I would like it to be known,

11:31.335 --> 11:34.168
and give me a moment because
I am a touch emotional,

11:35.395 --> 11:36.445
I forgive you.

11:36.837 --> 11:38.630
Yes, I do. Each and every one of you,

11:38.655 --> 11:40.645
I forgive you from
the bottom of my heart.

11:42.355 --> 11:45.375
Despite the many hardships
I have had to endure,

11:46.023 --> 11:47.609
I find I bear you no ill will.

12:02.692 --> 12:05.692
Don't be alarmed,
monsieur, you're quite safe.

12:06.480 --> 12:08.440
Governor Feron will explain.

12:14.937 --> 12:15.991
Come on.

12:16.531 --> 12:20.038
Your transaction with the Queen
of England is perfectly secure.

12:20.265 --> 12:23.102
Her Majesty has merely
been delayed by the storm.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.179
She hasn't changed her mind?

12:25.204 --> 12:26.633
Oh, far from it.

12:28.883 --> 12:32.354
You Dutch and your diamonds, hmm?

12:32.746 --> 12:36.686
The crown jewels of England are a
prize any merchant would covet.

12:39.214 --> 12:41.424
They will be yours very soon.

12:42.184 --> 12:43.475
While we await her arrival,

12:43.500 --> 12:45.690
the king has personally requested

12:45.715 --> 12:49.953
that I extend to you
the very best hospitality

12:50.758 --> 12:52.708
our great city has to offer.

12:53.304 --> 12:54.374
Hmm?

12:57.855 --> 12:59.599
That's Lady Francoise there.

13:02.856 --> 13:06.082
The diamonds I sold to her were to
be a gift for her darling Serena.

13:06.898 --> 13:08.402
Right, so what's our plan?

13:09.027 --> 13:11.088
Well, since you're the one who asked...

13:14.639 --> 13:17.766
I am terribly sorry for intruding
unannounced like this.

13:17.791 --> 13:19.464
Oh, please, intrude.

13:20.426 --> 13:21.722
Intrude.

13:24.491 --> 13:25.491
Ah.

13:29.216 --> 13:31.231
- Good afternoon. I'm D'Artagnan.
- Hello.

13:31.256 --> 13:32.630
Lovely to meet you. Who's this?

13:32.731 --> 13:34.786
Esmerelda. My youngest.

13:35.246 --> 13:36.497
- Esmerelda?
- Mmm-hmm.

13:36.770 --> 13:38.255
- Right.
- Oh.

13:38.371 --> 13:40.130
Ah, of course.

13:40.544 --> 13:42.316
Of course you have
more than one daughter.

13:42.326 --> 13:44.226
- Christine.
- Miss Christine.

13:45.286 --> 13:47.959
She's not the one I... Ah.

13:48.266 --> 13:51.266
Meet the feisty Rosalie.

13:52.226 --> 13:53.670
Rosalie, she's not the...

13:54.498 --> 13:55.528
Nice to meet you.

13:56.772 --> 13:59.255
You don't happen to have
any other daughters

13:59.256 --> 14:00.362
lying around in the oven...

14:00.387 --> 14:02.991
Please, never mind them.

14:03.316 --> 14:05.702
They are but girls.

14:05.727 --> 14:09.734
Of course. I was actually looking
to spend some time with Serena.

14:11.206 --> 14:12.841
- Hmm?
- Serena?

14:16.226 --> 14:17.833
That is Serena.

14:18.794 --> 14:21.331
The diamonds have been
woven into her tail.

14:21.559 --> 14:22.954
Unbelievable.

14:23.626 --> 14:26.366
Labourers toiling in
that field and in this one,

14:26.634 --> 14:28.366
a horse wears diamonds.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.820
And they wonder why
civil war looms in England.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.540
Stay here.

14:34.565 --> 14:36.148
This won't take long.

14:42.461 --> 14:44.516
Ah, magnificent animal.

14:45.073 --> 14:46.113
Rope.

14:48.854 --> 14:50.432
Off, off, off! Go in there.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.017
Go in there. Get the tail. Get the tail.

14:58.195 --> 14:59.195
Whoa!

15:02.306 --> 15:03.800
Shh! Easy.

15:04.266 --> 15:05.266
Easy.

15:06.256 --> 15:07.879
Get back, get back, get back.

15:08.662 --> 15:10.642
D'Artagnan, thanks for helping us out.

15:11.860 --> 15:13.290
- Go that way!
- Oh, oh, oh.

15:13.314 --> 15:14.569
All right, all right, all right! Oi!

15:16.953 --> 15:18.320
Okay.

15:18.515 --> 15:20.172
Let's do this.

15:21.656 --> 15:23.942
Get his head that way,
I'll get the tail.

15:23.967 --> 15:25.125
Right.

15:27.815 --> 15:29.266
I loathe this horse.

15:29.456 --> 15:32.426
Aramis, shoot the horse.

15:35.266 --> 15:36.305
Serena?

15:36.306 --> 15:37.286
- Yeah.
- No.

15:37.296 --> 15:39.226
Eh? I'm not shooting a horse.

15:42.783 --> 15:44.193
- Athos?
- Hey!

15:46.564 --> 15:47.614
Wait.

15:51.673 --> 15:52.683
Give me the rope.

15:54.419 --> 15:56.709
Shame on you. Shooting a horse, Athos?

16:00.236 --> 16:01.416
Be careful, D'Artagnan.

16:01.441 --> 16:03.097
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

16:03.403 --> 16:05.152
Trust me, I used to be a farmer.

16:06.082 --> 16:08.725
Shh, shh, shh.

16:15.216 --> 16:16.436
You could have done that before.

16:16.446 --> 16:18.346
Well, of course,
but where's the fun in that?

16:19.729 --> 16:21.609
Bonnaire. Grab the diamonds.

16:22.216 --> 16:23.536
Me? Er...

16:23.568 --> 16:25.707
Well, aren't you
the fearless highwayman?

16:26.276 --> 16:27.276
Yes.

16:28.029 --> 16:29.332
Yes, I suppose I am.

16:33.761 --> 16:36.391
Pass me a blade, someone.

16:38.641 --> 16:42.255
Yes, I suppose the horse's tail
will just grow back, won't it?

16:42.256 --> 16:44.246
But your head won't if you try anything.

16:49.607 --> 16:51.306
Oh, God. Shh.

16:56.141 --> 16:57.763
I thank you.

16:57.788 --> 16:59.316
It's easy when you know how.

16:59.341 --> 17:00.567
Thank you.

17:00.592 --> 17:01.435
Yes.

17:02.197 --> 17:03.791
A Musketeer's sword.

17:04.246 --> 17:05.869
It's all coming back to me now.

17:07.097 --> 17:09.017
Yeah, this is a fine piece of steel.

17:09.532 --> 17:11.702
Come on, that's enough fun
for one day, give it here.

17:12.473 --> 17:13.523
Come on.

17:21.054 --> 17:24.306
How long do you think I'd have to serve
to buy Constance just one of these?

17:24.558 --> 17:27.179
Well, there are other ways
to keep a woman content.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.347
Erm, Porthos?

17:36.660 --> 17:39.640
They'll find that
and put it to better use.

17:40.671 --> 17:41.681
Bonnaire.

17:44.226 --> 17:45.306
Bonnaire!

17:58.286 --> 18:00.206
- Come.
- How many?

18:11.266 --> 18:15.975
Rich or poor, we all deserve
the same chances.

18:16.433 --> 18:17.621
Liberty,

18:17.933 --> 18:20.144
equality aren't just words

18:20.361 --> 18:23.213
beloved of poets and dreamers,

18:23.730 --> 18:27.286
they should be
the core of every man's life.

18:27.527 --> 18:30.752
Why should a man
born in a Paris backstreet

18:30.777 --> 18:33.679
not have the same chances
as a man born into a palace?

18:36.356 --> 18:38.226
Yes!

18:39.812 --> 18:41.712
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

18:41.737 --> 18:43.088
- Thank you.
- You inspired me.

18:43.567 --> 18:45.567
- You know where to take these.
- Yes.

18:48.382 --> 18:50.211
- Powerful words.
- Oh.

18:51.023 --> 18:53.485
I hope we'll see you again, monsieur?

18:57.246 --> 18:58.107
What's this?

18:58.490 --> 18:59.570
Assistance.

19:00.099 --> 19:02.045
To use in whatever way you feel most...

19:02.615 --> 19:03.654
appropriate.

19:04.340 --> 19:05.370
Thank you,

19:06.206 --> 19:07.226
but no.

19:10.918 --> 19:12.426
I was like you.

19:13.362 --> 19:15.342
Dragged from place to place as a child.

19:16.528 --> 19:18.283
Nothing but darkness ahead.

19:18.707 --> 19:20.416
And behind?

19:20.824 --> 19:22.844
- Chaos.
- You fled the war?

19:23.497 --> 19:24.708
Many wars.

19:25.529 --> 19:27.693
My mother and I
settled for a time in Eparcy,

19:27.718 --> 19:29.882
but it didn't last.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.545
You fought alongside
the Musketeers at the Tavern.

19:37.756 --> 19:39.842
They care about the people of Paris.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.702
And yet now they are chasing
down diamonds for the king

19:43.727 --> 19:45.280
while you and your friends starve.

19:56.251 --> 19:57.978
Yes, it made me stronger.

19:58.412 --> 20:01.775
The torture, you understand,
not weaker, stronger.

20:02.372 --> 20:05.067
And, gentlemen, the evidence
is in front of your very eyes

20:05.092 --> 20:07.865
because it takes a very strong man

20:08.342 --> 20:10.426
to realise and admit
the error of his ways.

20:10.451 --> 20:12.623
And lesson learned,
you became a jewel thief.

20:12.865 --> 20:14.497
Preying on the defenceless.

20:14.895 --> 20:16.622
So no change there, then.

20:17.312 --> 20:19.386
Ahem, mitigating
circumstances, my friends,

20:19.411 --> 20:20.778
mitigating circumstances.

20:22.833 --> 20:26.038
Some of the diamonds, take them to
Treville, tell him there's more to come.

20:31.850 --> 20:34.241
You'll have one of your own
one day, I promise you.

20:35.578 --> 20:36.885
In the meantime, go.

20:37.714 --> 20:41.511
A-ha, you must be Madame D'Artagnan.

20:42.855 --> 20:45.872
Which goes to show, that
behind every great Musketeer,

20:47.560 --> 20:50.380
there is a beautiful
and rather fabulous...

20:52.200 --> 20:54.371
That is for the woman you robbed.

20:56.421 --> 20:59.446
And I accept your
kind token with gratitude.

20:59.471 --> 21:02.085
Now, pleasantries aside,

21:02.110 --> 21:04.461
I don't suppose there's anything to eat?
I'm famished.

21:04.471 --> 21:06.134
- Get back on your horse.
- Really rather hungry...

21:06.159 --> 21:07.527
We need to find the other two buyers.

21:07.552 --> 21:09.869
Erm, thank you.

21:10.541 --> 21:13.100
Thank you, Porthos.

21:13.449 --> 21:14.649
Thank you so much.

21:17.421 --> 21:18.421
Aramis!

21:20.615 --> 21:22.424
Your friend looks distressed.

21:23.391 --> 21:25.565
I'd feel less so
if I could speak to Aramis.

21:26.441 --> 21:28.237
Will it really take four Musketeers

21:28.262 --> 21:29.549
to retrieve a few diamonds?

21:29.870 --> 21:31.144
Do what you have to do.

21:45.947 --> 21:47.806
Fate has brought us back together.

21:48.355 --> 21:50.220
Just when I need you the most.

21:59.859 --> 22:00.958
Majesty,

22:01.474 --> 22:03.911
the Musketeers have
recovered some of your diamonds.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.501
They caught the highwayman?

22:06.661 --> 22:08.309
And got the better of him?

22:08.786 --> 22:12.381
He isn't quite the formidable
outlaw you imagined him to be.

22:12.391 --> 22:14.256
This is a pitiable amount.

22:15.982 --> 22:17.990
I shall need to borrow
the money from you.

22:18.225 --> 22:21.122
That is money for the Dauphin,
have some faith.

22:21.147 --> 22:23.451
Faith? England is set to burn, Louis!

22:23.602 --> 22:24.864
France shall be next!

22:25.854 --> 22:27.146
Settle, sister.

22:29.411 --> 22:31.896
How long can the Governor
distract Van Laar?

22:32.411 --> 22:34.685
Feron has a talent for distraction.

22:47.159 --> 22:48.491
Welcome, my friend.

22:50.481 --> 22:52.149
We have all evening.

22:52.174 --> 22:54.297
Surely you have an appetite for food?

23:00.828 --> 23:04.460
I need time to conduct my
business with Van Laar, Georges.

23:04.461 --> 23:06.831
Plenty of distractions,
no interruptions?

23:06.856 --> 23:08.963
And not the Queen of England.

23:16.439 --> 23:18.064
Just look at us, Aramis,

23:18.838 --> 23:22.057
you, a Musketeer and I, a Lady.

23:24.261 --> 23:26.129
Look how far we have come, eh?

23:29.721 --> 23:31.741
Oh, look, you must see these gloves!

23:34.683 --> 23:35.810
And this.

23:35.910 --> 23:38.448
If I hold it to a candlelight.

23:38.473 --> 23:41.042
There! You see? You see how it shimmers?

23:41.067 --> 23:43.924
Oh, and the house, the house.
You've got to see the house.

23:43.949 --> 23:46.957
Well, I say house. It's more
like a castle from a fairy tale.

23:47.245 --> 23:48.621
Pauline.

23:50.254 --> 23:52.211
You didn't come here
to show me your gloves.

23:53.883 --> 23:55.297
Now, they are beautiful

23:56.391 --> 23:58.859
and you have the brooch,
the castle. But still...

24:00.421 --> 24:02.351
Something's wrong. What is it?

24:04.289 --> 24:05.424
Yes.

24:06.401 --> 24:08.127
It does appear like I have everything,

24:11.026 --> 24:13.071
including a blackmailer.

24:19.774 --> 24:20.930
I'm really sorry,

24:20.955 --> 24:22.952
I had no idea you'd still be here.

24:24.030 --> 24:26.194
I needed somewhere quiet to work.

24:26.546 --> 24:28.872
Constance is practically family.

24:28.897 --> 24:30.807
You can speak freely. I...

24:31.421 --> 24:32.951
I trust her with my life.

24:36.657 --> 24:38.607
God, I'm in so much trouble.

24:40.481 --> 24:42.105
Aramis, wine.

24:46.351 --> 24:47.503
Tell me everything.

24:50.996 --> 24:52.855
Well, these, er,

24:53.471 --> 24:54.571
these letters.

24:55.176 --> 24:58.551
They started arriving just after
my engagement to St Pierre.

24:58.879 --> 25:01.235
I don't understand.
What will they tell of you?

25:03.195 --> 25:05.000
That I was a prostitute

25:05.907 --> 25:07.675
in the brothel that I grew up in.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.000
That we grew up in.

25:12.781 --> 25:13.883
My mother worked there,

25:13.908 --> 25:16.411
I lived with her till my
father came to take me away.

25:18.381 --> 25:20.361
I haven't seen Pauline since.

25:21.458 --> 25:23.373
- Your mother was...
- My mother.

25:25.576 --> 25:26.909
She was a beautiful woman.

25:26.933 --> 25:29.112
Her choices were always
for the sake of her children.

25:32.481 --> 25:33.481
Well,

25:34.823 --> 25:36.421
we all come from somewhere.

25:37.741 --> 25:39.913
I fear that, for all his virtues,

25:39.938 --> 25:42.334
St Pierre may not take a similar view.

25:44.834 --> 25:47.381
But won't your fiance
love you regardless?

25:48.189 --> 25:49.865
We can't change our pasts.

25:50.214 --> 25:52.607
Yes, but I feel like my old
life doesn't even exist.

25:54.481 --> 25:55.520
I am...

25:55.794 --> 25:57.176
I'm a new lady.

25:57.293 --> 25:59.283
I am who you see before you.

26:03.105 --> 26:04.692
Do you promise you'll help me?

26:07.701 --> 26:09.079
Of course he will.

26:14.683 --> 26:16.307
Van Laar!

26:16.613 --> 26:19.993
These Moroccan sweetmeats
are particularly delightful.

26:20.018 --> 26:22.510
No, thank you, Feron. I've had enough.

26:22.835 --> 26:24.855
They are an acquired taste, I suppose.

26:27.988 --> 26:29.291
What is that?

26:32.157 --> 26:33.207
Want a try?

26:38.259 --> 26:39.309
No?

26:39.334 --> 26:40.394
Oh, come.

26:40.419 --> 26:43.369
I thought you were a man of adventure?

26:43.394 --> 26:44.474
Where is the queen?

26:47.130 --> 26:48.140
Georges?

26:48.773 --> 26:50.703
Still no news, Governor.

26:53.855 --> 26:55.156
Alas.

26:57.633 --> 26:59.993
There is a matter I would
like to discuss with you.

27:01.048 --> 27:03.978
My king is curious to know

27:05.336 --> 27:08.246
if you would consider
making him a private loan.

27:09.466 --> 27:11.376
Wars are expensive.

27:12.739 --> 27:14.534
Wives are expensive.

27:15.516 --> 27:20.628
The queen has set her heart on
a rare and exquisite necklace.

27:21.659 --> 27:23.206
I'm sure you can appreciate

27:23.231 --> 27:28.366
the king cannot ask his ministers to finance
such a gift at this difficult time.

27:30.416 --> 27:33.736
You can be assured of my
complete discretion, Governor.

27:35.302 --> 27:37.119
But the rate of interest

27:37.728 --> 27:38.775
will be high.

27:39.008 --> 27:40.275
Mmm.

27:43.358 --> 27:44.518
Where are we going?

27:44.882 --> 27:46.312
To see Monsieur Dube.

27:46.859 --> 27:49.172
He is a tricky man with a short fuse.

27:49.386 --> 27:50.522
Surely it would be prudent

27:50.547 --> 27:52.242
if I were to go in unaccompanied.

27:52.506 --> 27:55.934
Then I can speak
to him first myself, alone,

27:56.396 --> 28:00.419
make him see sense, pave the way.
You understand?

28:01.293 --> 28:02.863
Yes, well, we'll decide that, Bonnaire.

28:05.486 --> 28:06.886
I have an idea.

28:07.581 --> 28:09.300
Let us employ a code.

28:09.769 --> 28:12.245
If things are going well,
then I shall say nothing.

28:13.151 --> 28:14.456
But if things go badly,

28:14.925 --> 28:17.136
then I shall signal to you
with the words,

28:17.602 --> 28:18.712
"Well, I never did!"

28:20.336 --> 28:21.579
What does that mean?

28:21.604 --> 28:22.809
I've no idea.

28:23.106 --> 28:24.270
The English say it all the time.

28:24.295 --> 28:26.450
- They don't know what it means either...
- Oh, just get in there!

28:28.169 --> 28:29.599
Trust me, my friends.

28:30.376 --> 28:31.631
We're not your friends.

28:33.173 --> 28:34.561
Comrades, surely?

28:43.761 --> 28:44.771
I hate him.

28:44.796 --> 28:46.326
You do know he'll try to run.

28:46.351 --> 28:48.046
Good. Then we can kill him

28:48.070 --> 28:49.391
and be done with this.

28:49.416 --> 28:51.476
Hello? Ahem.

28:52.866 --> 28:55.270
Hello, er,

28:56.416 --> 28:57.505
Monsieur Dube?

29:02.963 --> 29:03.998
Yeah.

29:04.023 --> 29:07.206
Thank you, thank you so much, gentlemen.

29:08.635 --> 29:09.665
Thank you.

29:11.612 --> 29:12.642
Ah.

29:21.426 --> 29:22.446
Dube.

29:23.697 --> 29:24.807
Bonnaire?

29:25.072 --> 29:27.038
Erm, the Musketeers and I...

29:27.063 --> 29:29.022
We, the Musketeers,

29:29.080 --> 29:32.054
are here to take back
the diamonds that I sold you.

29:33.346 --> 29:34.591
And I am here to counsel you,

29:34.616 --> 29:36.765
that should you try to stand in our way,

29:37.616 --> 29:39.599
you will likely
lose your head, monsieur.

29:40.064 --> 29:40.955
But I...

29:40.980 --> 29:44.908
I'm sorry, my hands are tied,
metaphorically, tied.

29:46.056 --> 29:49.496
Then I can only thank you
for your warning, Emile.

29:49.862 --> 29:52.416
Oh, that's ever so good of you, Dube!

29:52.635 --> 29:54.982
Thank you, honour amongst thieves.

29:55.007 --> 29:56.937
Not that we're thieves, erm, even...

29:58.828 --> 30:00.547
Musketeers!

30:02.426 --> 30:03.515
Wait there

30:04.000 --> 30:06.950
and I will give you
what is rightfully yours.

30:09.007 --> 30:10.917
Well, I never...

30:21.855 --> 30:23.405
Ah!

30:56.885 --> 30:58.046
Let's see how many there are.

31:10.734 --> 31:11.734
Look at that.

31:13.325 --> 31:14.416
There they are.

31:25.746 --> 31:29.134
I paid good money for these.

31:32.396 --> 31:33.586
Well, why don't you hand those over

31:33.611 --> 31:35.396
and not another word will be said.

31:36.012 --> 31:37.654
Not from your lips, no.

31:53.568 --> 31:54.608
Kill him, men!

32:02.346 --> 32:04.556
The great D'Artagnan.

32:04.783 --> 32:08.440
Killing you will greatly
enhance my reputation.

32:32.506 --> 32:33.606
All right.

32:33.631 --> 32:35.170
Fetch Aramis.

32:36.202 --> 32:38.376
I have seen him stitch men before.

32:38.386 --> 32:40.386
Oh, it's all right,
I've watched him many times.

32:40.396 --> 32:41.936
- You?
- Please find me a needle.

32:41.961 --> 32:43.795
Oh, for the love of God,
I beseech you, I beg you.

32:43.820 --> 32:45.608
No, not you, please, please.

32:45.633 --> 32:48.623
Actually, I feel a lot better,
I'm content to bleed.

32:48.648 --> 32:50.648
As you were when you were
being tortured, I imagine?

32:51.142 --> 32:53.118
You will find this funny,
my friends, but I...

32:53.306 --> 32:54.642
Look, the fact is,

32:54.946 --> 32:57.204
as soon as you put me on
that ship, I jumped overboard.

32:57.229 --> 32:58.657
I have never been in Spain.

32:59.196 --> 33:01.030
I have never been tortured.

33:01.396 --> 33:03.521
I have been in England for five years

33:03.546 --> 33:05.976
trying not to get infested with lice.

33:06.052 --> 33:07.984
Please, please.

33:08.009 --> 33:09.164
Go gentle with me, Porthos...

33:11.156 --> 33:13.321
Oh, mother of God!

33:13.346 --> 33:14.950
Shh, shh.

33:14.975 --> 33:16.319
Hey, hey.

33:16.344 --> 33:19.214
This is going to hurt me a lot more
than it's going to hurt you, all right?

33:19.239 --> 33:20.396
- Really?
- No.

33:20.406 --> 33:21.416
Hold him down.

33:31.264 --> 33:33.234
Good evening, Mademoiselle Boden.

33:36.542 --> 33:37.858
There's a meeting later.

33:37.883 --> 33:39.387
I thought you might like to come along.

33:43.221 --> 33:44.241
Please?

33:44.416 --> 33:46.573
You might even find
the discussion interesting.

33:47.516 --> 33:49.784
It would not be appropriate.

33:50.674 --> 33:52.744
I can't think of anything
more appropriate.

33:53.104 --> 33:55.559
Show the people of Paris the
Musketeers are their friends.

33:58.459 --> 33:59.509
Come inside.

34:01.278 --> 34:02.448
Let's drink some wine.

34:07.783 --> 34:09.713
You're chasing diamonds, I heard.

34:11.485 --> 34:13.107
I was chasing a thief.

34:13.398 --> 34:14.652
The people I speak for don't care

34:14.677 --> 34:16.081
if some duchess loses her necklace.

34:16.114 --> 34:18.264
They are having enough trouble
trying to feed their children!

34:18.302 --> 34:19.312
Sylvie?

34:21.376 --> 34:24.187
I want to understand you, Athos.

34:24.905 --> 34:26.321
I want to know who you are.

34:26.346 --> 34:28.734
I can't do that if you're not
willing to try and know me.

34:34.753 --> 34:36.723
Or perhaps that's not what you want.

34:43.416 --> 34:44.496
Perhaps.

35:41.256 --> 35:42.446
Mademoiselle has company.

35:42.456 --> 35:45.043
Yes, most enjoyable company, Corelle.

35:45.426 --> 35:47.801
- Pauline.
- Ah!

35:49.216 --> 35:50.286
You have brought your old friend.

35:50.296 --> 35:51.386
Yes.

35:51.630 --> 35:52.946
I am Aramis.

35:54.079 --> 35:55.600
Pauline and I grew up together.

35:55.625 --> 35:58.446
We... Our families were very close.

35:58.758 --> 36:00.522
- Welcome, Aramis.
- Thank you.

36:00.547 --> 36:01.890
I'm St Pierre.

36:02.226 --> 36:03.346
Will you be staying for the wedding?

36:03.621 --> 36:04.624
Yes, indeed.

36:04.703 --> 36:07.258
Aramis has agreed
to walk me down the aisle.

36:07.586 --> 36:09.456
Father, brother, friend.

36:10.216 --> 36:12.256
It seems you are all things to Pauline.

36:13.216 --> 36:14.701
Stop! Stop her!

36:14.726 --> 36:15.986
Come back here!

36:16.011 --> 36:17.851
- Hey.
- Thief! Thief!

36:18.178 --> 36:20.226
That is for the wedding feast.

36:21.722 --> 36:22.972
Give that to me.

36:23.256 --> 36:24.456
Come here.

36:27.937 --> 36:29.378
No.

36:31.981 --> 36:33.633
- Let her have what she likes.
- Monsieur?

36:33.658 --> 36:34.708
Feed her.

36:37.067 --> 36:38.863
Do as monsieur says. Feed the girl!

36:43.306 --> 36:44.306
Come on!

36:45.445 --> 36:46.738
If we can, we must.

36:48.034 --> 36:49.348
Yes.

36:51.853 --> 36:54.006
And that is why I'm marrying you today.

36:59.782 --> 37:00.812
Come.

37:21.236 --> 37:22.588
We need him awake.

37:23.250 --> 37:24.986
Oh, perfect. Give me the water.

37:25.011 --> 37:26.322
No!

37:35.346 --> 37:36.346
Oh!

37:38.073 --> 37:40.097
If you ever tire of being
a Musketeer, Porthos,

37:40.122 --> 37:41.316
I'm sure the medical profession

37:41.326 --> 37:42.946
would welcome you with open arms.

37:42.971 --> 37:45.704
We only have one more diamond to find.

37:45.729 --> 37:48.748
Yes, a blue one, worth a king's ransom.

37:48.749 --> 37:50.112
So wake him up,

37:51.308 --> 37:52.388
or I will.

37:58.121 --> 37:59.442
God forgive me.

38:08.769 --> 38:10.516
The blue diamond?

38:12.846 --> 38:14.666
Oh, God.

38:19.384 --> 38:21.464
I thought this
was going to be difficult.

38:21.489 --> 38:22.539
A mystery.

38:22.791 --> 38:24.955
A game of cat and mouse.

38:24.980 --> 38:26.378
But there you were.

38:26.403 --> 38:28.204
Feel free to tell me I'm mistaken,

38:28.229 --> 38:33.669
but whoever sent these
has a serious problem.

38:34.189 --> 38:35.299
Namely me.

38:36.359 --> 38:39.209
I don't hold with blackmail.

38:39.703 --> 38:40.856
But,

38:42.833 --> 38:44.249
this could end here.

38:46.199 --> 38:48.259
Peacefully, without recourse.

38:50.667 --> 38:52.174
But I know of her past.

38:52.199 --> 38:54.493
That was a different time,
a different life.

38:54.518 --> 38:55.548
I know that,

38:56.376 --> 38:57.496
and you know that,

38:59.229 --> 39:02.219
but do you really think others
will be so liberally minded?

39:02.229 --> 39:03.979
Let me worry about the others.

39:11.537 --> 39:13.205
St Pierre is in love.

39:14.984 --> 39:16.944
You have walked through palaces.

39:16.969 --> 39:18.989
Pauline and St Pierre
will be destroyed by it.

39:21.740 --> 39:23.328
I have to protect him.

39:23.701 --> 39:26.614
Pauline means more to me than
you could possibly imagine.

39:26.639 --> 39:28.966
I will protect her.

39:29.721 --> 39:31.036
Then do so.

39:42.289 --> 39:43.319
Oh, God.

39:43.670 --> 39:45.259
You're not going to
hit me again, are you?

39:45.436 --> 39:48.679
You're in no danger,
so long as you behave.

39:49.804 --> 39:53.412
Though, I can't understand why they
haven't just thrown you in prison.

39:53.437 --> 39:55.491
Well, if I am to have a jailer,

39:55.804 --> 39:58.635
then you would be my preferred choice.

39:59.269 --> 40:02.002
You would, because I like strong women.

40:02.552 --> 40:04.612
Actually, you remind me
very much of my first wife.

40:06.799 --> 40:08.769
Maria, God rest her soul.

40:10.505 --> 40:11.944
Yes, I, er,

40:15.465 --> 40:17.485
I keep her as close as I am able.

40:24.465 --> 40:25.750
She is my charm,

40:25.775 --> 40:26.935
my luck,

40:28.525 --> 40:29.976
my protection.

40:36.655 --> 40:38.843
I'm not really a thief. Not really.

40:40.203 --> 40:42.281
- Of course you're not.
- No, no, I'm not.

40:42.306 --> 40:43.436
I'm an apothecary.

40:43.695 --> 40:45.605
Now, I was a gardener

40:46.445 --> 40:48.151
who happened to fall in love.

40:49.800 --> 40:51.870
I vowed this time

40:51.895 --> 40:54.885
that I would keep my woman
safe from harm.

40:55.205 --> 40:57.245
By stealing the
Queen of England's diamonds?

40:57.435 --> 40:59.763
Which shows how madly in love I am.

41:03.861 --> 41:05.232
Just as you must be

41:05.959 --> 41:07.638
with D'Artagnan.

41:11.745 --> 41:13.250
You know,

41:14.435 --> 41:18.281
it's a shame you didn't use your
charm and wit more wisely, Bonnaire.

41:19.435 --> 41:20.903
You could have been somebody.

41:23.075 --> 41:24.950
Oh, wait, wait, we were having a nice...

41:29.495 --> 41:30.495
Hmm.

41:42.535 --> 41:43.802
For me?

41:46.425 --> 41:48.794
Oh, could you imagine
if they could see us now.

41:49.498 --> 41:50.707
Those other girls,

41:50.958 --> 41:53.281
can you imagine
the looks on their faces?

41:53.771 --> 41:56.761
My mother on the other hand, she would
have loved to be at your wedding.

41:56.786 --> 41:58.816
She would have probably cried.

41:59.055 --> 42:00.553
- Definitely cried.
- Definitely cried.

42:02.475 --> 42:04.585
You know she gave you up
for a better life.

42:05.049 --> 42:06.369
You must remember that.

42:07.125 --> 42:09.135
No mother could do more for her son.

42:12.505 --> 42:14.205
I thought of you often.

42:14.545 --> 42:15.994
You have?

42:16.233 --> 42:18.193
I should have taken you with me.

42:22.415 --> 42:25.223
My father never told me
she'd died until years later.

42:25.248 --> 42:27.365
So many lies, Pauline.

42:27.724 --> 42:30.763
Would it be so bad if you
told St Pierre the truth?

42:31.268 --> 42:32.949
Why build a wall of lies

42:32.974 --> 42:34.687
between you and those you love?

42:36.426 --> 42:37.960
Apologies, Aramis,

42:38.366 --> 42:39.859
may I steal her away?

42:46.388 --> 42:48.348
I have a wedding gift for you.

43:00.229 --> 43:01.415
This will go on my finger.

43:02.660 --> 43:03.683
But...

43:04.559 --> 43:05.814
this...

43:06.536 --> 43:08.064
is to go on yours.

43:18.288 --> 43:19.720
Monsieur, a word please?

43:19.745 --> 43:21.318
More Musketeers?

43:21.328 --> 43:22.449
On royal business.

43:22.473 --> 43:24.832
Yes, we need you to give up
a certain blue diamond.

43:25.338 --> 43:27.428
I will do nothing of the kind.

43:27.941 --> 43:31.041
It won't be of any great loss
to you financially.

43:31.298 --> 43:33.258
Money is not the issue here.

43:33.900 --> 43:35.260
Aramis?

43:36.258 --> 43:38.508
Do not despair, Pauline.
They will not take it from you.

43:38.533 --> 43:40.001
Rest assured we will.

43:41.278 --> 43:42.673
Can you do something?

43:44.318 --> 43:46.238
What is one more diamond?

43:49.258 --> 43:50.356
Gentlemen, take your leave.

43:50.793 --> 43:51.995
When we have what we came for.

43:52.020 --> 43:53.231
I said take your leave.

43:53.256 --> 43:56.082
Monsieur, we are not here
to stop you getting married.

43:56.575 --> 43:59.764
Trust me, nothing will stop that.

44:01.268 --> 44:04.045
- St Pierre!
- There must be another solution here.

44:04.485 --> 44:05.575
Monsieur, stand down.

44:06.211 --> 44:08.041
Ah, really?

44:09.262 --> 44:10.451
Really.

44:12.755 --> 44:13.826
Aramis.

44:14.326 --> 44:16.961
You know I hate following orders.

44:17.185 --> 44:19.295
Then don't make me give you one.

44:19.514 --> 44:21.038
Then lower your pistol!

44:23.977 --> 44:26.328
I never ask three times. Not of anyone.

44:36.278 --> 44:37.624
Fine. Here.

44:39.258 --> 44:42.042
There. Take it,
if it means that much to you.

45:01.962 --> 45:03.655
That was enjoyable.

45:04.238 --> 45:07.288
So, did you shoot him?

45:07.533 --> 45:08.543
No.

45:09.506 --> 45:11.397
No, Aramis is my penance.

45:13.152 --> 45:15.360
Yeah, mine too.

45:28.252 --> 45:30.302
I need your word
you won't stop this wedding.

45:32.853 --> 45:34.001
Corelle?

45:36.613 --> 45:39.533
I have some thoughts that
I'd like to share with you.

45:41.272 --> 45:44.095
Well, Aramis has warned you, has he not?

45:45.056 --> 45:47.292
Mademoiselle, some things
are not changeable.

45:48.611 --> 45:50.056
You have to leave.

45:50.480 --> 45:51.845
Ah.

45:53.134 --> 45:56.918
So you, you won't heed his caution then.

45:57.252 --> 45:58.988
As you failed to heed mine.

46:01.824 --> 46:03.764
I will saddle you a horse.

46:05.081 --> 46:05.917
Corelle...

46:05.941 --> 46:09.276
If you truly loved him, you will do this.

46:25.382 --> 46:26.799
Yes.

46:27.350 --> 46:28.784
Well, the thing is...

46:30.718 --> 46:32.197
I do love him.

46:37.686 --> 46:39.616
I'm ready, I'm ready!

46:40.294 --> 46:42.374
Ah, my dashing Aramis.

46:42.792 --> 46:44.629
Are you ready to walk me down the aisle?

46:45.539 --> 46:46.559
What?

46:51.621 --> 46:53.312
It's nothing, it's nothing.

46:54.114 --> 46:55.334
Pauline...

46:55.462 --> 46:58.496
Aramis, please. I'm different, please.

46:59.252 --> 47:01.144
Look at me, I'm someone new.

47:01.169 --> 47:03.442
I am wearing a silk dress!

47:04.110 --> 47:07.702
Please, please, I want this life
so much, please, I need this!

47:07.727 --> 47:09.534
St Pierre!

47:09.559 --> 47:12.044
Marry me!

47:13.168 --> 47:15.036
Will you marry me now?

47:18.146 --> 47:19.196
Aramis?

47:22.358 --> 47:23.646
I... I...

47:37.394 --> 47:38.414
Pauline...

47:56.282 --> 47:58.342
Bonnaire has escaped!

47:58.469 --> 48:00.054
Find him! Go!

48:18.411 --> 48:22.371
I was growing so, so nervous with worry.

48:22.396 --> 48:24.396
Dear friends, did you find the diamond?

48:25.222 --> 48:27.222
Oh, thank God.

48:27.541 --> 48:28.571
Thank...

48:29.175 --> 48:30.782
Make one move!

48:35.597 --> 48:39.052
Your Majesty, your diamond
and your thief.

48:40.857 --> 48:42.341
My gardener?

48:44.526 --> 48:45.616
Forgive me, ma'am.

48:45.896 --> 48:47.362
I am a thief,

48:47.833 --> 48:50.706
but I am also the principal
agent in the jewels' return.

48:50.731 --> 48:52.511
- Hang him!
- I could double your money for you.

48:52.536 --> 48:54.057
- Hang him now!
- Double your money.

48:54.082 --> 48:56.676
Surely if he could
accomplish that, ma'am.

48:56.701 --> 48:59.476
Don't trust him, every breath is a lie.

49:02.665 --> 49:05.193
He must have the money
he made from the sales.

49:05.226 --> 49:07.629
Yes, yes, I do!

49:09.566 --> 49:11.666
Now you have the diamonds back,

49:11.988 --> 49:13.283
you might sell them...

49:13.900 --> 49:15.182
again.

49:15.658 --> 49:18.244
Thereby all but doubling your money.

49:18.276 --> 49:20.339
We'd better send for your partner then.

49:20.456 --> 49:21.466
Partner?

49:21.491 --> 49:22.706
He has a partner.

49:23.546 --> 49:25.246
And the partner has the money.

49:25.546 --> 49:27.160
There shall be no bargaining.

49:27.576 --> 49:29.964
Give me your sword
and I will execute him myself.

49:29.989 --> 49:31.613
Wait, wait, wait. Double the money

49:31.638 --> 49:33.357
means double the arms for soldiers.

49:33.382 --> 49:35.902
And I for one would like to see you
win your war, Henrietta Maria.

49:35.927 --> 49:37.576
He betrayed me.

49:37.586 --> 49:38.626
Hmm.

49:38.636 --> 49:41.763
And yet, he has the means
to keep England safe.

49:47.161 --> 49:48.490
Show me this partner.

50:02.176 --> 50:04.789
I fear that is something I cannot do.

50:07.686 --> 50:09.506
Give me your sword!

50:10.666 --> 50:12.828
Emile, you fool!

50:13.158 --> 50:14.336
Caroline,

50:15.211 --> 50:17.211
it is you who are the fool, my love.

50:18.734 --> 50:20.250
What have you done?

50:22.311 --> 50:24.840
This was my plan, my idea.

50:25.098 --> 50:27.893
I was only trying to make
a better life for my wife.

50:27.918 --> 50:29.348
You're married?

50:29.606 --> 50:31.095
Without my permission?

50:31.330 --> 50:33.822
Hang me twice over, but not Caroline.

50:36.523 --> 50:38.483
Please, I beg of you.

50:38.556 --> 50:40.476
She kept your favourite ring.

50:41.169 --> 50:43.219
That was her idea, not mine.

50:43.441 --> 50:45.401
Bonnaire, do you have the money?

50:45.426 --> 50:46.787
I do. It lies hidden.

50:46.812 --> 50:50.205
Musketeers, take him and retrieve it.

50:50.361 --> 50:51.401
- Louis!
- Look.

50:51.411 --> 50:54.220
Don't let your anger
outwit your good sense.

50:58.368 --> 51:00.178
I petition the queen!

51:00.203 --> 51:02.401
I demand immunity from prosecution.

51:02.411 --> 51:03.655
You demand?

51:03.890 --> 51:06.249
Petition to demand.

51:06.405 --> 51:08.542
Not a penny crosses anyone's palm

51:09.660 --> 51:11.580
till you let Caroline walk free

51:12.301 --> 51:13.533
and me with her.

51:20.685 --> 51:22.076
Agreed.

51:23.060 --> 51:25.488
But you shall never
set foot in England again.

51:25.513 --> 51:27.530
I can promise you, ma'am,
that will never happen.

51:27.555 --> 51:28.583
God save you!

51:28.841 --> 51:30.216
God save you!

51:55.331 --> 51:57.331
Down amongst the dead men.

51:58.776 --> 52:00.104
Look at it all.

52:00.450 --> 52:01.612
You could live like a king.

52:02.371 --> 52:03.551
What of us?

52:04.105 --> 52:05.796
We have the Queen's pardon, Caroline.

52:05.821 --> 52:07.136
But not theirs.

52:08.042 --> 52:10.318
Who would know
if we ended up in this grave?

52:17.613 --> 52:18.770
Are we doing this?

52:19.966 --> 52:21.209
Comrades?

52:21.234 --> 52:22.256
Don't push it.

52:22.281 --> 52:24.670
As much as it pains
me to say, he did save my life.

52:24.695 --> 52:26.897
Assuming he wasn't aiming at you.

52:30.523 --> 52:32.127
Porthos?

52:47.131 --> 52:48.170
Well, that's settled then.

52:48.195 --> 52:49.180
Wonderful.

52:49.205 --> 52:50.810
Erm, gentlemen,

52:51.749 --> 52:53.469
it remains for me to say...

52:58.471 --> 52:59.797
All for one...

53:04.235 --> 53:05.656
- Yeah, well...
- Let's go.

53:18.165 --> 53:19.601
You got your money then?

53:21.125 --> 53:24.631
No one ever hears
you coming, do they, Grimaud?

53:26.381 --> 53:28.764
You're like a serpent in the night.

53:30.794 --> 53:35.286
I have resolved my problem
without your help this time.

53:35.757 --> 53:38.169
Tell me what is going on, Feron.

53:43.421 --> 53:44.642
The king

53:46.204 --> 53:47.282
is dying.

53:48.634 --> 53:51.925
The white plague
eating away at his lungs.

53:52.790 --> 53:55.740
That is excellent news.

53:56.431 --> 53:58.222
Hmm. Is it?

53:58.706 --> 54:01.311
Erm, I find myself troubled.

54:02.098 --> 54:03.431
You see,

54:04.791 --> 54:07.761
I know how it feels
to be halfway in the grave,

54:08.642 --> 54:11.302
to almost taste the dirt in one's mouth.

54:11.596 --> 54:14.357
The dirt will have to wait
a long time for me.

54:14.911 --> 54:15.841
Hmm.

54:16.028 --> 54:17.425
I hope so for your sake.

54:17.450 --> 54:21.985
God will certainly not
look upon us with kindness.

54:22.311 --> 54:24.805
I see no God
in this cesspit of an earth.

54:25.274 --> 54:29.461
The thought that Louis will leave
this world before me is strange.

54:29.650 --> 54:31.352
Very, very strange.

54:33.046 --> 54:34.734
We will take advantage of this?

54:35.242 --> 54:36.679
Oh, of course.

54:37.007 --> 54:38.328
The game is everything

54:38.353 --> 54:41.313
and you and I must continue to play it.

54:42.964 --> 54:46.191
Now is the time to bring
Gaston and his allies to heel.

54:46.216 --> 54:48.199
- Mmm.
- We need to pay for an army.

54:48.630 --> 54:50.872
All that is in hand, Lucien.

54:52.451 --> 54:53.793
Listen to this...

54:53.818 --> 54:57.715
I have a very audacious plan
to suggest to you...
