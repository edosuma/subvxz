00:02.736 --> 00:05.004
Hi, how can I help you?
And by that, I mean,

00:05.006 --> 00:07.439
What's the least I can do
to help you?

00:07.441 --> 00:10.209
I'll have the burger
with the fries.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.211
She'll have it
with the salad.

00:14.447 --> 00:16.215
But I want the fries.

00:16.217 --> 00:19.084
Well, you want them,
but you don't need them.

00:21.021 --> 00:25.124
Fine, the salad.
I have to pee.

00:26.993 --> 00:28.961
Hi, what's your name?
David.

00:28.963 --> 00:31.964
David, you should go.

00:31.966 --> 00:33.966
I'm sorry?

00:33.968 --> 00:36.068
You want her to have salad,
she wants you to have hair.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.470
Neither one's
gonna happen tonight.

00:40.073 --> 00:41.073
Yeah, it's not
gonna work out

00:41.075 --> 00:42.875
Between you
and french fries.

00:42.877 --> 00:45.044
Oh, maybe it will
for a week or a year.

00:45.046 --> 00:47.413
Depends if she was molested
as a kid.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.681
But one of these days,
she's coming after you.

00:49.683 --> 00:53.519
Probably in the dark,
probably with a knife.

00:53.521 --> 00:56.055
And she's gonna cut off
one or both of your balls.

00:56.057 --> 00:58.157
And you won't think
a side of fries matters

00:58.159 --> 01:00.826
When you have zero balls.

01:00.828 --> 01:03.195
She'll have the fries.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.197
Yes, she will.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.532
Look at us.

01:06.534 --> 01:07.699
We saved
another woman's dignity

01:07.701 --> 01:09.268
And another man's balls.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.970
Yeah, we're like dr. Phil
but more qualified.

Well, off the top

01:37.765 --> 01:39.131
I ordered a coffee
ten minutes ago,

01:39.133 --> 01:42.301
And you still
haven't gotten it.

01:43.870 --> 01:45.204
Hey, man,
I'm in the weeds here.

01:45.206 --> 01:48.474
Well, if you got weed,

F.Y.I., tiny dancer,

Prepping coffee is
that lazy-ass day waiter's job,

02:16.237 --> 02:18.070
So don't blame us.

02:18.072 --> 02:21.106
It's not our fault you hired
an incompetent waitstaff.

02:21.108 --> 02:23.342
Hurry up.
You two need to make coffee.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.110
And you need to hire
a new day waiter.

02:25.112 --> 02:27.079
And maybe while you're getting
new things around here,

02:27.081 --> 02:28.914

a brand-new coffeemaker?

at your cupcake window.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.306
Unless you're comfortable
with that.

No, I meant
the new day waiter.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.509

we told you to fire?

03:00.848 --> 03:02.281
We loved him.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.349
Okay, we'll go
train the new guy now.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.784
But about
that coffeemaker,

03:05.786 --> 03:07.352
What if go halfsies
with you?

03:07.354 --> 03:08.654
We can't afford
to go halfsies.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.222
We can't even
go quarter-sies

I don't get attached.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.220
All my life,
I've been a waiter,

04:15.222 --> 04:16.788
27 years.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.523
I've been a waiter
27 years too,

04:18.525 --> 04:20.859
And I'm only 26.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.394
And I don't get personal,

04:22.396 --> 04:26.131
So don't ask me
how old I am.

to know mine.

in his mouth

birthday party?

Yes, but I don't
bring that to work.

with you.

with me.

how the tables work.

We got the two-tops.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.668
Are you a top?
Oh, please.

this $25,000 face into a pillow.

take that table?

the new gay waiter.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.621
Oh, I love the gays.

05:56.623 --> 05:58.724

in my neighborhood

has really good crack.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.884

will be here any minute.

06:58.886 --> 07:01.720
Our lives are about to get
a lot more cappuccino-y.

07:01.722 --> 07:05.257
Or should I say a latte
more cappuccino-y?

07:05.259 --> 07:07.426
No, you should not
say any of that.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.561
And as for that
"special price,"

07:09.563 --> 07:10.595

07:37.591 --> 07:39.157
Shut up!

07:39.159 --> 07:40.592
Does it come
with instructions?

07:40.594 --> 07:43.428
The instructions
are to shut up.

07:43.430 --> 07:45.397
We don't want it
if it's stolen.

07:45.399 --> 07:47.766
I still feel guilty
about shaking down that redbox

07:47.768 --> 07:50.469
For <i>I don't know</i>
<i>how she does it.</i>

07:50.471 --> 07:51.803
I did not steal it.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.572
I knowingly bought it
from a man who stole it,

07:53.574 --> 07:55.440
And I'm selling it
at a profit.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.642
It's the armenian way.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.478
You're not armenian.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.514
I know, I'm just saying,
it's the armenian way.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.151
It retails for $600,

08:06.153 --> 08:07.619
But I'll give it to you
for free

08:07.621 --> 08:08.653
If you do me a favor.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.088
Free?

08:10.090 --> 08:11.456
Okay, I guess max
can do you

08:11.458 --> 08:14.092
In that closet over there.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.494
What?

08:15.496 --> 08:17.596
Now that I see it,
I have to have it.

08:17.598 --> 08:21.533
All right, I've been
saving this pill for something.

08:21.535 --> 08:22.934
Talk to sophie.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.536
See if she wants
to get back together.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.671
But don't tell her
I'm interested.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.673
Do it discreetly.
Deal.

08:28.675 --> 08:32.110
And, oleg, I'm touched
and a little surprised.

08:32.112 --> 08:35.647
I didn't know you knew
the word "discreetly."

08:35.649 --> 08:37.482
Oh, yeah. I have
a word-a-day calendar

08:37.484 --> 08:39.985
Near my bed,
next to my big pump jar

08:39.987 --> 08:42.454
Of pineapple lube.

08:45.491 --> 08:48.560
For when you're horny
and hungry.

08:51.130 --> 08:52.497
Max, why'd you take it?

08:52.499 --> 08:53.732
You don't have
to have sex with him.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.301
I know, I'm celebrating.

09:02.408 --> 09:04.209
Hey, I can't find
any of the instructions on here

09:04.211 --> 09:06.077
<i>For our coffeemaker.</i>

09:06.079 --> 09:07.646
In fairness,
I haven't been looking.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.014
I got sidetracked
by this buzzfeed list

09:09.016 --> 09:10.515
Of misspelled tattoos.

09:10.517 --> 09:14.152
This girl got "you go grill"
on her neck.

09:15.721 --> 09:19.291
She must really like
to cook outside.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.227
Did you put yourself
in a time-out?

09:22.229 --> 09:23.728
No, I'm looking for sophie.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.030
She's not upstairs.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.698
Look, this is
a long way to go

09:26.700 --> 09:27.933
To get something for free.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.668
I was happy
to walk into sears

09:29.670 --> 09:32.103
And stuff a cappuccino machine
down my pants.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.673
I'm not doing it
for the free cappuccino machine.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.875
I'm doing it
for the money we'll make

09:36.877 --> 09:39.544
From the free
cappuccino machine

09:39.546 --> 09:42.113
And maybe to help oleg
and sophie get back together.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.582
You know, it's a page
out of shakespeare,

09:43.584 --> 09:44.716
And I'm puck.

09:44.718 --> 09:47.352
Puck from <i>the real world?</i>

09:48.554 --> 09:50.589
Am I the only one
who's read a book?

09:51.557 --> 09:52.958
[thud]
[gasps]

09:52.960 --> 09:54.392
Oh, here she is.
I'll do the talking.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.694
It's kind of
in my wheelhouse.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.062
You have a wheelhouse,

09:57.064 --> 09:58.730
And we're living
in this dump?

09:58.732 --> 10:01.566
Morning, sophie.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.735
You caught me.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.203
I'm doing the walk of shame.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.738
You know what that means,
right?

10:06.740 --> 10:10.775
I was having sex all night
with a stranger.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.577
I had sex with a guy
all night once.

10:12.579 --> 10:15.981
At least that's what he said.
I fell asleep at 10:00.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.549
Sophie, come in.

10:17.551 --> 10:18.917
We wanted to ask you
something kind of important.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.552
Oh, okay.

10:20.554 --> 10:22.587
Well, I'll tell you.

10:22.589 --> 10:24.122
I don't think
you're gonna make it

10:24.124 --> 10:26.658
In the cupcake business.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.960
Not what the psychic
in the subway told me,

10:28.962 --> 10:31.096
But duly noted.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.598
Actually, it's more
of a personal question.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.101
Oh, okay.
Well, I personally

10:36.103 --> 10:37.502
Don't think
you're gonna make it

10:37.504 --> 10:39.004
In the cupcake business.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.905
No, the question
is about oleg.

10:40.907 --> 10:43.108
Oh, yeah,
he agrees with me.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.410
God's sakes, just tell her
before she tells us

10:45.412 --> 10:47.112
We're gonna wind up
in some disgusting apartment,

10:47.114 --> 10:49.247
Hiding from our pimp.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.316
Okay, okay, sophie.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.417
Do you ever think about

10:52.419 --> 10:53.918
Getting back together
with oleg?

10:53.920 --> 10:55.987
Oh, god, no.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.123
I'd rather accidently
have sex again

10:58.125 --> 11:00.625
With my cousin.

11:00.627 --> 11:03.695
I hate when that happens.

11:05.297 --> 11:06.698
Why, did--

11:06.700 --> 11:08.299
Did he ask about me?

11:08.301 --> 11:09.934
Oh, no, no.
I was just wondering.

11:09.936 --> 11:11.536
He never even mentions you.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.138
Oh, good.

11:13.140 --> 11:16.107
'cause I moved on, baby.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.710
Oh, no. No, I--

11:18.712 --> 11:23.314
I left my spanx
on that staten island stoop.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.616
And they're the good ones,
you know,

11:24.618 --> 11:26.017
With the pee hole in them.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.686
I gotta go grab 'em.

11:27.688 --> 11:29.721
All right. Bye-bye.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.463
Okay, good.
Now we've got the power on,

11:38.465 --> 11:40.165
But how do we
steam the milk?

11:40.167 --> 11:41.833
Maybe it's
on this touchpad thing.

11:41.835 --> 11:44.803
[spraying]
holy mother of god!

11:44.805 --> 11:47.972
I just steamed my vagina.

11:47.974 --> 11:50.341
Caroline, your shift

11:50.343 --> 11:52.544
Started three minutes ago.
Who cares about sidework?

11:52.546 --> 11:55.313
I probably
can't have children.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.749
What is wrong with her?

11:57.751 --> 12:01.252
She just had her carpet
steam-cleaned.

12:04.690 --> 12:07.058
You two still haven't
figured out this machine?

12:07.060 --> 12:08.727
Move away.
I'm asian and a man.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.228
I'm good
with this kind of stuff.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.730
Well, han, actually,
it's pretty dangerous.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.666
Hey, han's a man,
according to recent lore.

12:14.668 --> 12:16.668
Let him save the day.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.870
Okay, let's see.
Here's the steam one.

12:18.872 --> 12:22.607
And here's the button for--
ow!

12:22.609 --> 12:24.008
My neck!

12:24.010 --> 12:25.677
It burned my neck!

12:25.679 --> 12:28.580
And that was
my best feature.

12:28.582 --> 12:30.081
Luckily you're not taller.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.517
You would've
burned your vagina.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.954
That cappuccino machine
might have just

12:35.956 --> 12:38.890
Given me
a grande hysterectomy.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.726
Caroline, I know
this might not be a good time.

12:41.728 --> 12:46.297
I heard
about your recent clambake.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.270
But what did sophie say?

12:52.272 --> 12:54.639
I'm sorry, oleg.
Sophie's moved on.

12:54.641 --> 12:55.807
She's seeing other men.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.609
Yeah, but not
in your neighborhood.

12:57.611 --> 12:58.910
She's classy.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.211
She had the decency
to do it on a stoop

13:00.213 --> 13:01.746
In staten island.

13:01.748 --> 13:05.116
She went to the island
without me?

13:05.118 --> 13:09.387
We were going to travel
the world together.

13:10.723 --> 13:11.723
Oleg--

13:11.725 --> 13:12.891
Oleg, are you crying?

13:12.893 --> 13:17.762
No, I have
a booger situation.

13:17.764 --> 13:22.000
Says the man
who cooks the food.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.770
Hey, what's this area
back there?

13:25.772 --> 13:27.906
Uh, it's our closet, why?

13:27.908 --> 13:29.174
I should check it out.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.775
I'm always
looking for places

13:30.777 --> 13:33.144
To have sex with women
who are not sophie.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.747
[crying]

13:35.749 --> 13:37.515
Is oleg in here?

13:37.517 --> 13:39.751
I thought I smelled him.

13:39.753 --> 13:44.055
That delicious mix
of man and butter.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.991
Oleg's in the closet.

13:46.993 --> 13:50.261
Oh, honey,
I could've told you that.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.432
Really, luis,
oleg is straight.

13:54.434 --> 13:55.834
Wait till you
see what happens

13:55.836 --> 13:58.770
When I place an order
for a bone-in rib eye.

13:58.772 --> 14:01.206
It's true.
He shows us his penis every--

14:01.208 --> 14:05.643
Ah-ah-ah-ah, boundaries,
girls, boundaries.

14:05.645 --> 14:09.013
So is it a nice one?

14:10.316 --> 14:12.383
Well, it did open a door
for me once.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.855
Hey, luis,
maybe you can help us.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.656
Since you're a lifer, you have
to know how to work this thing.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.124
No, no, no, no, no, no,
I work for a diner.

14:20.126 --> 14:21.459
I don't work for you.

14:21.461 --> 14:22.894
Don't bring me
into your drama.

14:22.896 --> 14:25.697
<i>[sex and the city</i> theme
ringtone]

14:25.699 --> 14:27.031
Oh, I have to get this.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.466
It's my mother.
She's on death watch.

14:28.468 --> 14:29.901
But we used to have
the same machine

14:29.903 --> 14:31.302
When I worked at starbucks.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.538
<i>Mami, como esta</i>
<i>su lou gehrig's?</i>

14:35.841 --> 14:37.809
No, I am not
working at starbucks.

14:37.811 --> 14:41.012
That's not what
I was gonna say.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.747
Just for two hours.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.016
We can quit after we learn
how to work this damn machine.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.584
Hey, I am not a quitter.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.987
I get fired.
That's my wheelhouse.

14:54.226 --> 14:55.994
I can't believe
we got hired so quickly.

14:55.996 --> 14:59.030
And I can't believe
I'm a medium apron.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.865
And I can't believe
I'm working

15:00.867 --> 15:02.233
For a corporate coffee place.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.835
This might be the lowest point
of my life,

15:03.837 --> 15:06.004
And my mom once lost me
in a craps game

15:06.006 --> 15:08.072
Behind a casino.

15:09.775 --> 15:11.409
Hi, we're here
to be trained.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.878
I know.
That's unfortunate.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.079
My name's devon.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.382
Well, that's unfortunate.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.017
Let's get this over with.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.085
I have a lot of other places
I need to be.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.954
Like your mom's basement?

15:22.956 --> 15:25.290
Hey, you don't have
to give me attitude.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.058
I don't have to,
but it's my pleasure.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.793
Sorry, devon.
It's just that

15:28.795 --> 15:31.629
It's hard for her,
'cause your name is devon.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.798
So what are you girls?
Writers?

15:33.800 --> 15:37.035
Folk duo?
Just bitches?

15:37.037 --> 15:39.637
Nailed it, loser.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.306
Max, pace yourself.
We need this job

15:41.308 --> 15:42.807
For another hour
and 50 minutes.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.409
Okay, but for real,
how long do you

15:44.411 --> 15:46.244
Gotta work here before
the health insurance kicks in?

15:46.246 --> 15:48.079
And is there dental?

15:48.081 --> 15:49.914
'cause I got a dead tooth
doing nothing for me.

15:49.916 --> 15:52.317
The insurance kicks in
after 30 days.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.419
But it's a ppo,
not an hmo.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.087
Oh, we just got an hmo
at our other job.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.956
He's a charlotte.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.924
Okay, here we go.

15:59.926 --> 16:02.627
Look, this is the machine
we use for everything.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.762
It's incredibly easy to work
unless you're stupid,

16:04.764 --> 16:06.230
In which case, tell me now.

16:06.232 --> 16:07.932
Devon, we're not
your mean stepdad.

16:07.934 --> 16:10.735
Just show us
how to use the machine.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.337
Listen up.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.405
Unlatch the portafilter
from the group head.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.074
Press here
for an ounce of grounds.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.142
Tamp it in, pack it down,
turn it on.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.644
I didn't get that,
did you?

16:19.646 --> 16:22.747
Honestly, all I heard
was group head.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.248
So you tamp, pack,
turn the knob,

16:24.250 --> 16:26.617
Wait 3, blast for 30,
then you pour the shot.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.353
Place the steam wand
halfway in the pitcher

16:28.355 --> 16:31.255
At a 45-degree angle
until the milk is 103 degrees.

16:31.257 --> 16:35.093
So what you're saying is
it's easier to make meth?

16:35.095 --> 16:38.096
Syrups, powders,
whipped cream is right here.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.197
You ever work
with one of these?

16:39.199 --> 16:40.999
I think I can handle it.
I went to wharton.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.134
Well, I went to harvard.
And I went to juvie.

16:43.136 --> 16:46.037
And we're all here
wearing an apron.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.842
A grande double cap,
non-fat.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.543
Grande double cap,
non-fat.

16:52.545 --> 16:55.013
Meow, meow, meow,
meow, meow.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.015
A venti triple cap,
no whip.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.716
Venti triple cap,
no whip.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.152
Meow, meow, shmeow, meow.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.954
Grande double soy latte.

17:02.956 --> 17:05.289
Grande double soy latte.
Got it, max?

17:05.291 --> 17:07.525
Nope.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.227
Where's those drinks, max?

17:09.229 --> 17:11.929
Working on it,
getting close.

17:13.165 --> 17:16.734
And I finished
all over myself.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.669
That's so me.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.238
Come on, max,
it can't be that hard.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.806
You two, switch.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.141
I gotta put out
more napkins.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.143
That women's breakup
support group is here,

17:25.145 --> 17:27.011
And they tap us out.

17:27.013 --> 17:28.079
Think they're crying now?

17:28.081 --> 17:30.615
Just wait till we
run out of cake pops.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.252
I'll have a tall cap,
triple-shot half caf.

17:34.254 --> 17:37.321
Small scrap nipple slap
half half.

17:40.159 --> 17:41.759
That's not what I said.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.561
Tall cap triple-shot
half caf?

17:43.563 --> 17:44.929
Girl, you're good at this.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.931
You should
work at starbucks.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.933
I am good. I think
I'm getting the hang of this.

17:48.935 --> 17:50.568
Now I just have to--

17:50.570 --> 17:52.737
Holy mother of--
ouch!

17:52.739 --> 17:54.372
This thing
hates women so much,

17:54.374 --> 17:56.441
We should call it texas.

18:01.046 --> 18:03.448
Or ohio.

18:03.450 --> 18:06.117
Or, to be honest,
most of america.

18:06.119 --> 18:09.220
I'll have a tall drip,
extra hot.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.421
Uh, what's your name?

18:10.423 --> 18:12.290
Gregg, with three "g"s.

18:12.292 --> 18:15.359
Yeah, you're gonna be
this picture of a penis.

18:19.865 --> 18:21.232
That's rude.

18:21.234 --> 18:25.236
Now it has a hat on it.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.472
It's saying, "good day."

18:27.474 --> 18:29.207
Do you want me to talk
to your manager?

18:29.209 --> 18:32.310
Yeah, in about 20 minutes,
after she learns this machine.

18:34.313 --> 18:36.247
Hi.

18:36.249 --> 18:39.283
I'll take a non-fat
venti drip for vera

18:39.285 --> 18:42.487
And a tall latte for fran

18:42.489 --> 18:46.290
And a gingerbread latte
with 11 splendas.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.260
Can you two explain
what this is?

18:49.262 --> 18:50.561
I'd say it's pretty obvious.

18:50.563 --> 18:53.064
That's a penis
wearing a hat.

18:53.066 --> 18:54.832
Why?

18:54.834 --> 18:59.170
Because it's bald
and a little insecure.

18:59.172 --> 19:02.440
Dudes, you're, like, fired.
Come on, devon.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.575
We just need 20 more minutes
to learn that machine.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.310
Please?
No.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.412
Return your aprons
and caps.

19:08.414 --> 19:09.814
And do not even think

19:09.816 --> 19:12.016
About putting sandwiches
in your pockets.

19:12.018 --> 19:13.951
What?

19:13.953 --> 19:16.320
A girl can't
get a morning bun?

19:16.322 --> 19:18.422
No and no.

19:18.424 --> 19:21.492
And take this "crappuccino"
you made with you.

19:24.363 --> 19:27.165
Oh, yeah,
that is not quite right.

19:27.167 --> 19:30.368
And it hit my dead tooth.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.675
How you doing
with that milk?
Great.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.478
Mine's more whipped
than nick cannon.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.013
<i>Hola, chicas.</i>

19:42.015 --> 19:43.381
How's it going
with your new machine?

19:43.383 --> 19:46.284
Not that I care
or am invested at all.

19:46.286 --> 19:47.785
Oh, I think mine's coming.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.820
I think mine's coming.

19:49.822 --> 19:52.190
You don't even know
if you're coming or not?

19:52.192 --> 19:54.158
[chuckles]
that's so you.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.160
Have you seen oleg?

19:56.162 --> 19:58.462
No, not since he came out
of the closet.

19:58.464 --> 20:00.031
Why are you
looking for him?

20:00.033 --> 20:02.300
How is this your business?

20:02.302 --> 20:04.702
Because you said,
"have you seen oleg?"

20:04.704 --> 20:06.470
You got me.

20:06.472 --> 20:08.206
Look at you.

20:08.208 --> 20:11.142
So much spice,
so much pain.

20:11.144 --> 20:12.677
You got me.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.312
Hey, everybody.

20:14.314 --> 20:18.249
<i>Hola,</i> oleg,
and oleg's sister?

20:18.251 --> 20:20.151
This is sasha.

20:20.153 --> 20:23.354
We met last night
and a few times this morning.

20:23.356 --> 20:24.255
But do me a favor.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.423
Don't tell sophie
about this?

20:25.425 --> 20:26.857
No, do tell her.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.259
I've moved on.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.494
I filled
that hole she left.

20:30.496 --> 20:32.697
Come on, let's get you
back to your uncle's house

20:32.699 --> 20:35.866
Before he wakes up.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.735
Oh, it happens
to a lot of gays.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.403
They come out,
they freak out,

20:39.405 --> 20:41.272
They go back in.

20:41.274 --> 20:43.407
But I see him.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.343
And I'll be here
until he sees me.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.678

20:47.680 --> 20:49.513
<i>Hola, mami.</i>

20:49.515 --> 20:53.217
Uh-oh. Charlotte's
headed for a fall.

20:53.219 --> 20:55.853
I did it.
I made a perfect cappuccino.

20:55.855 --> 20:59.857
75% of my body is burned,
but I did it.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.425
So how is it?

21:01.427 --> 21:03.527
We are so putting
the small scrap

21:03.529 --> 21:06.597
Nipple slap half half
on the menu.
