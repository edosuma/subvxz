NARRATOR:
Two weeks ago,

00:03.962 --> 00:06.374
an invisible dome
crashed down on Chester's Mill,

00:06.548 --> 00:08.459
cutting us off
from the rest of the world.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.966
Why the dome is here
or What mysteries lie ahead,

00:11.136 --> 00:14.549
we still don 't know.
Every day, it tests our limits,

00:14.723 --> 00:17.305
bringing out the best
and the worst in us.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.180
Some say
we 7/ be stuck here forever.

00:21.980 --> 00:25.723
But we will never stop ﬁghting
to ﬁnd a way out.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.267
Do you think this is where Lyle
disappeared to?

00:28.445 --> 00:29.810
It's a tunnel.

00:29.988 --> 00:33.276
James, I expect you know
that I’m alive.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.111
Your mother told you to trust Lyle?

00:35.285 --> 00:37.867
- You mean before she died?
- Two days ago, she sent me an e-mail.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.778
She's alive.
She's out there somewhere.

00:39.957 --> 00:41.288
I saw that in my dream.

00:41.458 --> 00:44.700
I've seen it too.
It's in my hometown, Zenith.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.288
That's the same town that I'm from.

00:46.463 --> 00:49.125
You keep saying you're on my side,
but it seems like you turned on me.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.915
You killed a 19-year-old girl
that your nephew loved.

00:52.094 --> 00:56.554
I had to. Everything Pauline
put in herjournal has come true.

00:56.723 --> 01:00.011
It says in here that if those
four kids die, the dome comes down.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.561
You're not gonna touch those kids.

01:01.728 --> 01:02.979
Sam!

01:09.486 --> 01:10.851
Hey.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.066
Bad dream?

01:15.867 --> 01:17.448
Sam jumping off the cliff.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.536
You couldn't stop him.

01:21.707 --> 01:25.199
It's what he said before he jumped.

01:29.965 --> 01:31.956
That he admitted to killing Angie?

01:32.134 --> 01:35.626
- He said a lot of things.
- He's crazy.

01:35.804 --> 01:40.548
I mean, he thought his dead sister's
drawings of Angie and the hands

01:40.726 --> 01:42.933
were some kind of message.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.968
If he killed them,
the dome would come down.

01:45.772 --> 01:46.932

- Aren't you?

wanting to kill us kept me awake.

last night?

Not since it showed us the obelisk
from Zenith.

What?

03:34.798 --> 03:36.004
What happened?

03:36.174 --> 03:39.337
Yesterday when you went
into the tunnels with Sam to find Lyle,

03:39.511 --> 03:42.969
it was because we thought
Lyle killed Angie,

03:43.140 --> 03:44.880
except he didn't.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.673
Sam did.

I saw the scratches
that she left on him.

03:53.108 --> 03:55.975
And once I knew, he jumped off
of a cliff at the end of the tunnel.

Look, the whole reason I got into
trouble in the first place yesterday

04:52.626 --> 04:54.833
is that I wasn't fully equipped
to explore the tunnels.

I need you to get me into the dome.

32:40.417 --> 32:41.998
You want me to get you
to the dome?

32:42.461 --> 32:44.668
I need to get a message to somebody
on the inside.

32:44.838 --> 32:46.248
- Who?
- It doesn't matter.

32:46.423 --> 32:48.505
Obviously it does,
or you wouldn't be here.

32:48.675 --> 32:50.176
Dad, trust me.

32:50.343 --> 32:52.425
I wouldn't be asking you this
if it wasn't important.

32:52.596 --> 32:54.757
Dale, the dome coming down

32:54.931 --> 33:00.176
is arguably the most significant event
in history.

33:00.353 --> 33:01.809
The whole world is watching.

33:01.980 --> 33:05.814
The National Guard has established
a ten-mile nO-go zone

33:05.984 --> 33:07.440

I can't go to my friends in DC.

They're gonna think that I'm a fool.

has been for our family.

If you did, you wouldn't have run off
and joined the army.

- No.

You think it was a coincidence

33:59.204 --> 34:02.696
that she got sick
right after you came home?

She knew
she was running out of time.

She just wanted to say goodbye.

for anything.
