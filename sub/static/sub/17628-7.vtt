WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:02.484
Previously on "Salem"...

00:04.868 --> 00:06.212
Black Sunday is coming.

00:06.243 --> 00:08.328
We have but five days
left of life in Salem.

00:08.383 --> 00:11.125
We must move inside the mansion.
The only safe place is inside.

00:11.160 --> 00:13.189
There's one with child.
Will you have a look?

00:13.244 --> 00:14.304
With child?

00:14.650 --> 00:16.971
- What's your name?
- Gloriana.

00:17.147 --> 00:18.711
- You're the baby's father?
- Mm-hmm.

00:19.017 --> 00:20.732
Cotton Mather.

00:21.451 --> 00:23.553
Wha...

00:23.554 --> 00:27.588
I have ensured your child
a healthy, happy life

00:27.614 --> 00:30.578
as the beloved child of
Cotton Mather and his wife,

00:30.592 --> 00:31.750
Anne Hale.

00:35.422 --> 00:37.046
Isaac is a truth teller!

00:37.243 --> 00:41.241
Three cheers for Isaac!

00:41.478 --> 00:43.570
- Ugh!
- You freed us, Isaac.

00:45.823 --> 00:48.148
We're your men now.

00:48.573 --> 00:49.628
I have a surprise for you.

00:50.315 --> 00:53.322
Black Sunday will be
a new beginning for us.

00:54.714 --> 00:56.701
Our brothers must be released.

00:56.713 --> 00:59.666
While you play with
toys, they burn in hell.

00:59.691 --> 01:00.930
Perhaps I made a mistake

01:00.955 --> 01:02.745
choosing you of all of them to help me.

01:02.776 --> 01:05.102
The devil's brother will destroy Mary

01:05.104 --> 01:06.775
unless you destroy him first.

01:06.812 --> 01:09.822
You must forge a dagger with that in it

01:09.878 --> 01:12.106
and kill him with the dagger.

01:12.128 --> 01:15.046
We must find out what Sebastian knows.

01:15.058 --> 01:16.698
If you have no magic, either,

01:16.737 --> 01:18.524
how can you expect to stop Sebastian?

01:20.003 --> 01:21.820
Alden is my past. You...

01:21.826 --> 01:24.004
- are my future.
- I believe that, Mary.

01:24.558 --> 01:26.650
I may not be able to
change in an instant

01:26.675 --> 01:28.127
the way you feel about him,

01:28.378 --> 01:30.967
but I can change the
way he feels about you.

01:37.433 --> 01:39.783
- No kiss goodnight?
- I hate you.

01:40.823 --> 01:42.110
You cannot deny it was good.

01:42.143 --> 01:44.589
And that is precisely why I hate you.

01:50.737 --> 01:52.422
If that is what your hatred tastes like,

01:52.441 --> 01:53.898
I look forward to your love.

01:54.018 --> 01:55.362
Oh, do they make love in hell?

01:55.731 --> 01:57.753
Because surely as the
sun is near rising,

01:57.778 --> 01:59.719
the boy will see you
there before he lets me go.

01:59.723 --> 02:02.827
I told you I can free
us of him, and I will.

02:04.839 --> 02:07.862
Leave with me before
Sunday's blood dawn.

02:08.601 --> 02:10.496
My family castle lies
far across the ocean,

02:10.514 --> 02:12.361
and I can take us there.

02:16.190 --> 02:19.180
Stop tempting me.

02:19.581 --> 02:20.813
It is no use.

02:20.831 --> 02:24.083
- Even if I wanted to, I cannot.
- Yes, you can.

02:24.690 --> 02:26.041
Let Salem burn.

02:26.079 --> 02:29.263
Let the boy rant over
his charred puppets.

02:29.284 --> 02:31.854
You owe nothing, and
you leave nothing behind.

02:32.034 --> 02:34.813
You've never even seen the world
outside these muddy borders.

02:35.276 --> 02:37.134
The old world is filled with splendors.

02:37.151 --> 02:40.319
This new world is a cesspool...
and Salem its rank bottom.

02:40.581 --> 02:42.289
You do not understand.

02:42.331 --> 02:45.443
The Essex used their sacred
tree to resurrect my life force.

02:45.480 --> 02:46.851
I am forever bound to it.

02:46.882 --> 02:49.529
They warned me I can never
travel beyond its roots.

02:49.714 --> 02:52.157
And you believe those
shriveled tree worshippers?

02:53.246 --> 02:56.756
They knew you would
abandon them and run away

02:56.988 --> 02:59.315
as soon as you returned.
So they had to keep you here

02:59.435 --> 03:01.192
if not with a simple lie.

03:02.330 --> 03:03.763
You don't believe me.

03:21.515 --> 03:23.521
Far from the roots of Salem.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.161
Now do you believe me?

03:44.706 --> 03:47.283
You test my word with my very life.

03:47.305 --> 03:49.795
- Forgive me.
- I am bound to this hell.

03:49.915 --> 03:51.675
At present, this very house.

03:52.368 --> 03:54.234
But if you must go, then go.

03:54.258 --> 03:55.535
No.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.038
I will not leave you here.

03:58.278 --> 04:00.078
A promise easily made,

04:00.109 --> 04:02.499
yet we will see just how
loyal you prove to be.

04:02.518 --> 04:05.577
I worship you. Ask of me anything.

04:05.987 --> 04:08.280
There is only one way
we can be together.

04:08.917 --> 04:10.380
You must choose.

04:10.383 --> 04:12.604
Me or the boy.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.587
Will you help me kill him?

Anne?

05:11.265 --> 05:12.741
I'm here, my love.

05:12.808 --> 05:14.398
I got your message and came at once.

05:14.436 --> 05:16.980
- Are you not well?
- I have vomited twice this morning.

05:17.012 --> 05:19.296
- Ohh.
- Never felt so well.

05:20.896 --> 05:22.710
Then let the light in.

05:22.830 --> 05:25.144
The sun shines but a few more days.

05:25.207 --> 05:27.691
We must make the most of it.

05:31.438 --> 05:32.584
But...

05:46.776 --> 05:48.839
But it is hardly a week.

05:49.339 --> 05:50.752
I believe...

05:50.872 --> 05:54.957
my witch blood has quickened
the speed of life itself.

06:00.798 --> 06:02.345
My child...

06:04.210 --> 06:05.624
Our chance.

06:08.102 --> 06:10.035
Life is a force of nature

06:10.073 --> 06:12.234
that not even the
devil's fire can stifle.

06:15.688 --> 06:17.668
Here, amid all this turmoil...

06:19.273 --> 06:21.223
my dream comes true.

06:25.546 --> 06:27.266
I will be a loving father.

06:27.590 --> 06:30.913
And I will be the best
mother this baby could have.

06:32.274 --> 06:35.530
I implore you to come
to the Sibley house. Now.

06:35.901 --> 06:37.726
I must have you and...

06:38.537 --> 06:40.436
and our child safe.

06:42.351 --> 06:44.452
I must finish a few things.

06:45.022 --> 06:47.093
Then I will gather what I need

06:47.155 --> 06:50.496
and come by the end
of the day. I promise.

Nothing I don't intend to pay for.

08:26.786 --> 08:30.193
Look. This is for you to take off

08:30.218 --> 08:31.683
and not come back before dawn.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.020
I've got work to do.

08:34.635 --> 08:35.725
What kind of work?

08:36.318 --> 08:37.451
Need to make me a knife.

08:37.479 --> 08:38.852
Got no place to make it in.

08:39.928 --> 08:42.294
My knife needs to be
forged by my own two hands.

08:42.832 --> 08:45.474
It's a... family tradition.

08:50.259 --> 08:51.811
John, leave him be.

10:03.684 --> 10:05.142
<i>My dearest John,</i>

10:05.375 --> 10:08.921
<i>my every heartbeat is
ignited by the thought of you.</i>

10:15.077 --> 10:16.854
<i>I have already gained
crucial information</i>

10:16.866 --> 10:18.179
<i>that I must share with you.</i>

10:18.823 --> 10:20.164
<i>But I can hardly confess</i>

10:20.181 --> 10:21.955
<i>what I have had to do to obtain it.</i>

10:25.038 --> 10:26.091
Witch!

10:27.157 --> 10:28.161
Beast!

10:36.803 --> 10:39.955
I don't want to harm you.

10:46.701 --> 10:49.158
Why are you doing this to me?

10:50.497 --> 10:52.001
My baby...

10:52.121 --> 10:54.045
Cotton's baby.

10:55.107 --> 10:57.057
I have saved his child.

10:58.042 --> 11:01.439
This baby would most likely
have died in childbirth

11:01.446 --> 11:03.664
to a woman in such poor health as you.

11:03.898 --> 11:06.556
Do you not see all I have done for you?

11:07.134 --> 11:09.850
You... bitch.

11:10.114 --> 11:12.946
Your bastard child would
have been born out of wedlock,

11:13.066 --> 11:16.310
and Cotton would have had no
choice but to turn his back,

11:16.362 --> 11:18.704
deny his upstanding name to both of you.

11:18.727 --> 11:21.569
So, you see, this is for
the best for everyone.

11:21.689 --> 11:24.989
And I am generous enough to help you.

11:26.100 --> 11:30.918
You stole the life from inside me.

11:32.113 --> 11:34.750
God will strike you.

11:34.777 --> 11:37.837
God will see one of his kind
creatures saving another!

11:38.068 --> 11:40.757
Lie for your own ears' sake,

11:40.806 --> 11:45.377
but you and I both know what
kind of creature you truly are!

12:18.365 --> 12:20.411
I know I am an unwelcome guest here.

12:20.531 --> 12:21.552
No.

12:21.870 --> 12:23.376
You are a gift.

12:24.598 --> 12:27.591
We have all dreamed of
swallowing the warm blood

12:27.622 --> 12:29.227
of the line that betrayed us

12:29.240 --> 12:33.482
and all the hives that
roamed this mossy orb.

12:34.060 --> 12:35.818
I come only as a messenger.

12:36.155 --> 12:38.442
Then it be a fool's errand.

12:39.367 --> 12:44.622
We want no orders from that
foul dwarf hell itself excreted.

12:45.578 --> 12:47.224
I was sent by Mary.

12:48.825 --> 12:50.838
Tonight she plans to vanquish the boy.

12:51.726 --> 12:53.247
She can not do it without you.

12:55.695 --> 12:57.369
Let my truth be heard!

13:00.875 --> 13:01.905
Look around you.

13:04.341 --> 13:06.026
We live in the sludge

13:06.146 --> 13:08.384
running from those fine houses.

13:10.986 --> 13:14.910
Their Puritan piss washes
right into your alleyways.

13:17.375 --> 13:19.812
You ever wonder why
they treat you like dogs?

13:21.733 --> 13:23.690
Because you live like dogs!

13:25.056 --> 13:26.771
Never wash yourselves.

13:27.369 --> 13:29.146
Screw each other in the street,

13:29.153 --> 13:31.112
in the plain sight of children!

13:34.071 --> 13:35.197
I know.

13:35.901 --> 13:39.114
If the truth was easy to
hear, everyone'd tell it.

13:40.547 --> 13:42.018
But it gets you branded.

13:42.928 --> 13:44.509
Made an example of.

13:47.600 --> 13:48.952
Well, here's the hard truth,

13:49.653 --> 13:51.265
and I ain't afraid to tell it.

13:53.890 --> 13:55.502
We're not their equals.

13:57.391 --> 13:58.563
We're their betters!

13:58.643 --> 13:59.832
Yes!
Yes!

13:59.838 --> 14:00.930
Or could be.

14:01.109 --> 14:03.767
That's what them
Puritans are so afraid of.

14:06.315 --> 14:08.832
There's more of us
than there is of them.

14:10.402 --> 14:13.255
And the day we finally respect ourselves

14:13.965 --> 14:16.047
enough to stand up for ourselves,

14:16.779 --> 14:19.085
- that's the day they fear.
- Let us not fear them!

14:19.102 --> 14:20.793
The day of their reckoning.

14:22.369 --> 14:23.809
We don't need their law!

14:25.187 --> 14:26.495
Or their contempt!

14:27.703 --> 14:29.523
We're gonna clean up these streets,

14:29.540 --> 14:31.231
and we're gonna have our own law!

14:32.477 --> 14:34.999
Where being poor don't make you guilty!

14:37.506 --> 14:38.574
Who is with me?

14:39.911 --> 14:42.084
What is that Greek sea
monster that, when you

14:42.820 --> 14:44.326
cut off one of his heads,

14:44.339 --> 14:46.903
another grows back even
more hideous than the last?

14:47.584 --> 14:52.544
I think you refer to the dreaded Hydra
of ancient myth.

14:52.910 --> 14:54.089
No.

14:54.777 --> 14:56.807
I refer to that shit-sayer

14:56.829 --> 14:59.291
whose head swells
even bigger than before

14:59.342 --> 15:01.012
because your cowardly self

15:01.013 --> 15:03.102
couldn't even rid Knockers Hole of him.

15:04.191 --> 15:08.756
Isaac has grown most popular,

15:10.184 --> 15:12.744
but disposing of him permanently,

15:13.762 --> 15:16.232
that would have brought
the worst attention

15:16.266 --> 15:18.294
to our little corner...

15:18.449 --> 15:19.990
and to you.

15:20.248 --> 15:21.670
Well, if you truly loved me,

15:21.672 --> 15:24.507
you wouldn't keep me locked
away in this wretched quarter,

15:24.546 --> 15:26.311
ruled by my own worst enemy.

15:26.339 --> 15:27.580
No, no, no, no.

15:27.700 --> 15:28.834
Yes.

15:29.873 --> 15:30.964
Yes!

15:31.363 --> 15:33.264
You look out the wrong window.

15:34.952 --> 15:36.983
You look in the gutter

15:38.172 --> 15:40.788
when you should look at
the finer side of town.

15:40.844 --> 15:43.733
The side of town you will
be living in soon enough...

15:43.787 --> 15:45.100
- with me.
- How?

15:46.540 --> 15:48.846
Those who don't know I'm
a witch know I'm a whore.

15:49.269 --> 15:51.407
They know nothing of the kind.

15:52.099 --> 15:53.330
Yes, they do.

15:53.356 --> 15:54.569
Nothing.

15:55.339 --> 15:56.831
Let me tell you

15:57.240 --> 15:58.492
a story.

15:59.147 --> 16:00.334
Come.

16:08.491 --> 16:09.804
A story about...

16:11.191 --> 16:12.570
a poor motherless girl.

16:12.690 --> 16:14.587
Preyed upon by witches,

16:14.617 --> 16:18.563
deceived by Mary Sibley herself.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.351
A girl made scapegoat

16:22.237 --> 16:24.217
for the crimes of others,

16:24.466 --> 16:29.272
driven to fend for herself
out in the dangerous woods,

16:29.815 --> 16:32.420
and barely escaped with her life.

16:34.253 --> 16:37.993
Mary Sibley has already been cast out

16:38.075 --> 16:39.770
of polite society...

16:40.171 --> 16:43.139
a servant in her own home.

16:44.377 --> 16:46.249
And I see no reason

16:46.369 --> 16:49.979
why the role she so
dramatically filled...

16:50.293 --> 16:52.057
the Belle of Salem...

16:53.425 --> 16:57.469
should not fall to the worthy beauty

16:57.646 --> 16:59.522
I see before me.

17:13.784 --> 17:16.270
You're the last person I
thought I'd see in this place.

17:16.279 --> 17:17.435
Anne Hale.

17:17.458 --> 17:20.211
Oh! I came to see the
Madame of the house.

17:27.618 --> 17:29.828
Do you not recognize me, old friend?

17:33.709 --> 17:34.778
Mercy?

17:36.935 --> 17:38.250
In the flesh.

17:39.179 --> 17:41.680
But what are you... doing here?

17:42.183 --> 17:43.703
You know what they say...

17:43.987 --> 17:46.766
the only women in this
world with any real powers

17:46.998 --> 17:49.196
are whores and widows.

17:49.992 --> 17:52.225
So you became a whore?

17:53.207 --> 17:54.643
Give it time.

17:54.875 --> 17:57.236
I may yet become a widow.

18:00.082 --> 18:04.783
Now, what brings this pale
paragon of Puritan virtue

18:05.226 --> 18:07.606
into my cozy den of sin?

18:09.004 --> 18:10.574
It is a delicate matter.

18:12.586 --> 18:13.952
That I would prefer

18:14.025 --> 18:16.202
to discuss in private.

18:17.233 --> 18:19.262
My quarters are private, indeed...

18:20.971 --> 18:22.855
and quite occupied.

18:25.956 --> 18:29.208
But I'm always aroused
by delicate situations.

18:34.251 --> 18:35.590
I will come to you.

18:36.294 --> 18:38.020
When it is convenient for me.

18:38.510 --> 18:39.712
Good day.

18:40.766 --> 18:41.884
Good day.

18:50.428 --> 18:51.760
Go away!

18:52.081 --> 18:54.106
You have at every turn damned my life,

18:54.330 --> 18:55.401
this town,

18:55.788 --> 18:57.613
very possibly this entire world.

18:57.733 --> 18:59.097
In just three days' time

18:59.110 --> 19:00.520
there may be nothing left of your life,

19:00.545 --> 19:01.976
this town, this entire world,

19:02.006 --> 19:04.691
unless you help me stop
what I set in motion.

19:06.321 --> 19:07.774
Do you know what this is?

19:08.220 --> 19:09.688
No.

19:10.632 --> 19:12.187
No, it cannot be.

19:12.348 --> 19:13.901
You know what it is.

19:14.936 --> 19:16.446
Red Mercury.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.447
- I want nothing of it.
- Cotton, please.

19:21.479 --> 19:22.894
This is his weapon.

19:22.926 --> 19:24.674
I fear this will bring
about Black Sunday.

19:24.716 --> 19:25.997
You should fear.

19:26.117 --> 19:27.632
Even in the great tomes of Greece

19:27.664 --> 19:29.826
it was said to come from
the bowels of the underworld.

19:31.020 --> 19:32.839
"And the earth shall be scorched."

19:33.889 --> 19:35.591
Every flower, every blade of grass

19:35.625 --> 19:37.426
"shall be licked by the
flames of hell itself."

19:37.453 --> 19:38.503
In all those tomes,

19:38.544 --> 19:40.308
did they ever mention a way to stop it?

19:40.668 --> 19:42.730
Only by stopping he who wields it.

19:43.667 --> 19:45.659
- Cotton...
- I will help you no further.

19:45.678 --> 19:47.347
- You're afraid.
- I am.

19:47.501 --> 19:49.167
But not on my own account.

19:50.109 --> 19:51.816
I have others to think of.

19:54.070 --> 19:55.322
Anne...

19:56.382 --> 19:58.058
who carries my child.

20:00.507 --> 20:02.191
I had no idea.

20:05.294 --> 20:08.800
I will not ask you to risk
theirs or your own life.

20:09.735 --> 20:11.764
But do just this one thing for me.

20:12.527 --> 20:14.191
Deliver this letter to John.

20:14.271 --> 20:17.604
I promise you, I will
ask for nothing more.

20:23.441 --> 20:24.828
<i>Come.</i>

20:31.229 --> 20:32.800
<i>Cotton.</i>

20:44.211 --> 20:47.377
Cotton, my son. Come closer.

20:47.497 --> 20:49.066
Father are you in there?

20:49.214 --> 20:50.632
Yes. Here.

20:50.826 --> 20:52.363
<i>Where you shall be.</i>

20:52.777 --> 20:54.318
<i>Where you already are.</i>

20:54.328 --> 20:56.373
I'm coming, Father. I'll help you!

20:57.006 --> 20:59.200
<i>Your shoulders, Cotton.</i>

20:59.407 --> 21:03.164
<i>The heaviest burden, Salem's
salvation.</i>

21:03.185 --> 21:05.133
<i>Abandon all hope.</i>

21:05.154 --> 21:08.844
<i>Do not abandon hope, you who enter
here.</i>

21:08.870 --> 21:10.764
Father, I don't understand.

21:11.920 --> 21:13.770
What are you trying to tell me?

21:14.281 --> 21:16.203
<i>When you are asked,</i>

21:16.515 --> 21:17.820
<i>say yes.</i>

21:20.702 --> 21:21.972
Stay away from this door!

21:21.982 --> 21:24.198
- My father is in there!
- Then pray for him.

21:24.247 --> 21:25.565
Who lies beyond that door?

21:25.640 --> 21:26.684
Haven't you guessed?

21:26.764 --> 21:28.420
I insist that you tell me now.

21:29.175 --> 21:32.395
Beyond that door lies hell itself.

21:41.992 --> 21:43.694
Stole a loaf and two pheasants.

21:44.915 --> 21:47.533
My boy hasn't had
sustenance in two weeks' time

21:47.553 --> 21:48.832
since we were driven from our home.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.535
You're an educated man.

21:52.078 --> 21:54.488
You find no sympathy from the Puritans?

21:54.805 --> 21:55.854
We are Quaker.

21:55.908 --> 21:58.090
French and Indians
burned all that we had.

21:58.974 --> 22:01.204
And those who toiled to bake that bread

22:01.322 --> 22:02.858
and hunt those pheasants?

22:03.210 --> 22:05.665
Should they have nothing
to show for their efforts?

22:05.911 --> 22:08.197
Thievery will not be tolerated.

22:10.006 --> 22:11.689
But neither will hunger.

22:16.295 --> 22:17.759
This man...

22:18.361 --> 22:20.259
could be any one of us.

22:21.951 --> 22:24.966
And as such, he will
be fed like a brother.

22:27.339 --> 22:29.204
But he will also work off his crime

22:29.229 --> 22:31.533
by cleaning our streets here
for a period of one week.

22:33.431 --> 22:36.132
Let... let... let go!

22:37.836 --> 22:39.079
John Alden?

22:39.784 --> 22:40.805
Isaac?

22:40.925 --> 22:42.603
They caught him red-handed
at the smith's shop.

22:43.018 --> 22:45.835
- We had an arrangement...
- Smith ain't nowhere to be found.

22:46.345 --> 22:47.690
What's this about?

22:47.749 --> 22:49.048
This?

22:51.433 --> 22:53.915
What is all this about?

22:54.531 --> 22:55.908
Where's the Magistrate?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.837
Who made you judge and jury?

22:59.343 --> 23:01.501
They don't care what happens here.

23:03.803 --> 23:05.079
We do.

23:08.386 --> 23:10.658
You swear you done right by the Smith?

23:12.456 --> 23:13.800
Yeah.

23:15.611 --> 23:17.197
I vouch for this man.

23:17.851 --> 23:20.806
But if the smith should
return with another story,

23:21.665 --> 23:23.239
or not return at all,

23:24.014 --> 23:25.977
John Alden will answer for it.

23:30.021 --> 23:31.899
So, are you gonna
tell me why you decided

23:31.925 --> 23:33.986
to take up smithing in your spare time?

23:35.840 --> 23:37.620
Too many bad ears around.

23:37.631 --> 23:39.374
I'll tell you when it's over.

23:41.138 --> 23:42.626
If I'm still around.

23:43.041 --> 23:44.579
If any of us are.

23:45.699 --> 23:47.194
What's coming, John?

23:47.507 --> 23:48.749
An attack.

23:49.355 --> 23:50.948
And it's closer than you think.

23:52.490 --> 23:54.765
- Reverend Mather?
- Speak of the devil.

23:54.949 --> 23:56.819
And his ass-licking servants.

23:57.999 --> 23:59.694
But you don't know the full truth, John.

24:01.041 --> 24:02.446
I was spelled.

24:03.513 --> 24:04.791
I'm better now.

24:05.952 --> 24:07.674
So your sermon the other day...

24:08.014 --> 24:10.599
A charade. An act of survival.

24:10.608 --> 24:13.799
- I'm here to make it right.
- Yeah. Well, it's a little late.

24:13.884 --> 24:15.656
Would you prefer never?

24:15.776 --> 24:18.303
Please. Just spare me
a moment of your time.

24:19.303 --> 24:21.555
There is much to explain.

24:23.340 --> 24:25.112
Red Mercury.

24:26.632 --> 24:30.307
Took less than a thimbleful
to wipe out Sodom and Gomorrah.

24:31.774 --> 24:33.620
And Deerfield.

24:35.266 --> 24:36.901
Saw it myself.

24:36.995 --> 24:38.667
I've got men all over the woods,

24:38.692 --> 24:40.432
watching for any sign of a cannon.

24:40.557 --> 24:42.558
No. The attack will not
come from the forests.

24:42.565 --> 24:44.373
It will come from within.

24:45.777 --> 24:47.440
And you know this?

24:48.571 --> 24:51.581
Mary was able to draw
it out of Sebastian.

24:52.775 --> 24:54.209
How?

25:15.708 --> 25:17.933
- Could you...
- One of these days John,

25:17.954 --> 25:19.347
should the Good Lord spare us,

25:19.352 --> 25:21.563
I intend to teach you proper letters.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.489
"My dearest John,

25:36.859 --> 25:39.606
my every heartbeat is
ignited by the thought of you.

25:41.220 --> 25:43.058
I have already gained
crucial information

25:43.084 --> 25:44.450
that I must share with you.

25:44.961 --> 25:48.505
Already I've learned the attack is not coming
from outside of Salem, but from within.

25:49.455 --> 25:52.239
I can hardly confess what I
have had to do to learn this,

25:53.880 --> 25:55.778
but I believe you may already know.

25:57.616 --> 25:59.880
I have no choice but to stay the course.

26:00.311 --> 26:03.161
Sebastian is their tool,
and I must make him mine.

26:06.718 --> 26:08.880
Please know that we fight the same war.

26:09.690 --> 26:11.763
I in here, you out there.

26:12.875 --> 26:14.197
Try not to think of what I do,

26:14.207 --> 26:16.122
as I try not to imagine
the deadly danger

26:16.167 --> 26:17.770
that you place yourself in.

26:19.444 --> 26:21.099
All that matters is that we stop them.

26:21.506 --> 26:25.212
If we do, we shall have all
the days and nights of our lives

26:25.233 --> 26:26.615
to make it right.

26:28.330 --> 26:29.856
And if we fail,

26:32.067 --> 26:34.802
my sins will burn along
with the rest of us.

26:37.715 --> 26:38.856
All my love...

26:40.285 --> 26:41.395
Mary."

26:46.491 --> 26:49.565
You and I have been cursed...

26:51.254 --> 26:52.849
with complicated women.

26:55.149 --> 26:56.684
Complicated witches.

26:57.713 --> 26:59.911
Yet witches who have
captured our hearts.

27:04.454 --> 27:06.036
And mine is with child.

27:09.017 --> 27:10.677
I am to be a father, John.

27:13.461 --> 27:15.544
I will not let my child be an orphan

27:16.507 --> 27:19.711
before he draws his first
breath of life on this Earth.

27:23.181 --> 27:25.882
I, too, am father to a witch's child.

27:29.388 --> 27:31.567
Look how that turned out.

27:42.775 --> 27:45.431
Behold the bride of Satan.

27:45.754 --> 27:48.247
Queen to the child I myself birthed.

27:50.352 --> 27:53.083
Well, do you not think I
will make a splendid goddess?

28:00.852 --> 28:02.950
I am under no delusions.

28:04.622 --> 28:05.770
Nor are you.

28:06.926 --> 28:10.255
We are but servants to
the newly exalted God

28:10.266 --> 28:11.864
he has fashioned himself into.

29:54.392 --> 29:55.981
I must speak to you, my lord.

29:56.826 --> 29:59.196
I've been expecting you.

30:00.270 --> 30:02.890
It's time we talked about you...

30:04.208 --> 30:05.935
and my mother.

30:06.602 --> 30:08.731
My lord, I have a grave
indiscretion to confess.

30:09.226 --> 30:10.628
How was she?

30:12.571 --> 30:14.059
Have no fear.

30:14.317 --> 30:17.497
Unlike my Father, I have
no taste for virgins.

30:18.576 --> 30:19.669
Enjoy her.

30:20.564 --> 30:21.989
Until Sunday...

30:22.242 --> 30:24.513
when I will finally make her mine...

30:25.309 --> 30:27.239
body and soul.

30:27.890 --> 30:30.716
Now, what is it you wish to speak about?

30:32.800 --> 30:35.809
You have held my loyalty
for centuries, my lord,

30:36.778 --> 30:38.866
but in Mary's embrace I faltered

30:38.895 --> 30:41.434
and, in secret, I've
conspired against you.

30:44.342 --> 30:46.014
I beg your mercy.

30:48.273 --> 30:49.951
You betrayed me?

30:50.348 --> 30:51.764
As we speak,

30:51.791 --> 30:53.964
she plots in the woods with
her Essex kin to slay you.

30:55.447 --> 30:57.691
You allowed her to leave, knowing this?!

30:57.910 --> 31:00.120
I saw a chance to redeem my sins,

31:00.145 --> 31:01.879
allow you to catch her in the act,

31:02.681 --> 31:04.362
to destroy the hive
that has been the cause

31:04.364 --> 31:06.128
of so much dissent.

31:09.446 --> 31:12.647
Destroying those conniving Essex

31:13.200 --> 31:14.970
once and for all...

31:17.071 --> 31:19.741
...this will bring me great pleasure.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.083
Take me to them.

31:32.536 --> 31:34.285
Mercy, a pleasure.

31:34.316 --> 31:35.881
Don't bother.

31:40.793 --> 31:42.245
What do you need from me?

31:44.549 --> 31:46.949
I came across a wayward young lady

31:47.305 --> 31:49.364
among the refugee melee, and

31:49.514 --> 31:52.526
I have nursed her back to health,
but I can do no more for her.

31:54.788 --> 31:56.175
And I can?

31:57.082 --> 31:59.151
I believe in her past this girl was...

31:59.755 --> 32:01.269
employed in...

32:03.296 --> 32:05.308
a profession such as...

32:05.593 --> 32:08.175
the one practiced in the establishment

32:08.386 --> 32:10.277
of which you are a proprietor.

32:12.049 --> 32:14.322
She was a whore, you mean.

32:16.128 --> 32:17.472
Please.

32:20.057 --> 32:23.238
We have both felt the thrust
of the Dark Lord's goat

32:23.325 --> 32:25.259
deep inside us

32:25.692 --> 32:28.425
and given ourselves over to his lust.

32:29.674 --> 32:31.464
Let us not be modest.

32:37.448 --> 32:38.636
Now,

32:39.567 --> 32:41.293
where is this girl?

33:01.166 --> 33:02.769
Aren't you pretty?

33:02.961 --> 33:06.069
If it pleases you, Miss.

33:06.332 --> 33:08.519
My dear, this is Miss Mercy.

33:08.914 --> 33:10.708
She's going to take care of you now.

33:16.568 --> 33:18.202
What is your name?

33:21.783 --> 33:24.117
I don't... remember.

33:26.963 --> 33:28.808
And how did you come here, to Salem?

33:29.209 --> 33:30.545
Oh, why...

33:33.757 --> 33:36.621
I don't... remember that either.

33:38.747 --> 33:41.152
It is the way with
so many of these girls

33:41.294 --> 33:43.613
who've been through
the trauma of the war.

33:48.352 --> 33:50.300
Sometimes it's better that way.

33:51.114 --> 33:53.596
The past only stirs up pain.

33:54.429 --> 33:56.589
Let us create a new life for you,

33:56.753 --> 33:58.135
yes?

34:05.584 --> 34:08.347
You'll owe me for cleaning up your mess.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.550
And congratulations.

34:12.042 --> 34:13.045
What?

34:13.215 --> 34:16.759
I sense a yawning emptiness in her womb.

34:19.721 --> 34:21.313
All is fair in love and war...

34:23.353 --> 34:25.607
if there's really any difference.

34:30.293 --> 34:31.953
Come, my little bird.

35:05.962 --> 35:08.025
My child...

35:08.218 --> 35:10.252
It is a grave hour I fear.

35:10.639 --> 35:13.182
Yet one of ultimate freedom.

35:14.475 --> 35:16.511
I am so proud of you.

35:17.543 --> 35:19.549
Would that this day had never come.

35:19.760 --> 35:22.361
The course of life is not ours to direct

35:23.136 --> 35:25.080
but the primordial right of the Earth.

35:25.105 --> 35:27.314
Hers is the only will we carry forth.

35:27.917 --> 35:29.572
She is indebted to you,

35:30.046 --> 35:31.570
as are we, Mary,

35:32.318 --> 35:34.023
for what you will do.

35:34.956 --> 35:37.010
It is I who am grateful.

35:37.314 --> 35:38.760
Be brave.

35:38.880 --> 35:40.770
It will all be over soon.

35:40.881 --> 35:42.216
Oh, yes.

35:42.241 --> 35:43.947
Very soon.

35:44.885 --> 35:46.643
Why would you conspire against me?

35:47.387 --> 35:50.840
You and I are not only of one
flesh... we are of one soul.

35:51.085 --> 35:52.699
Yours just as black as mine.

35:52.766 --> 35:55.869
No. No, I swallowed the
bitter taste of evil,

35:55.947 --> 35:58.278
but in service of something greater.

35:58.594 --> 36:00.455
You only want greatness for yourself.

36:00.516 --> 36:03.432
- And for you.
- I don't want to be a god.

36:04.171 --> 36:05.573
Only a woman.

36:06.060 --> 36:08.885
Do you think your namesake
asked to be chosen?

36:09.119 --> 36:11.588
Your consent is not required.

36:12.114 --> 36:14.025
I really must thank you, Sebastian,

36:14.050 --> 36:15.916
for arranging this entertainment.

36:24.312 --> 36:27.016
- Do not compound your errors!
- I've made none.

36:27.337 --> 36:28.588
None of us have.

36:28.902 --> 36:32.301
Only you, child.

36:33.393 --> 36:35.691
You think a few rotted
vines can hold me?!

36:37.670 --> 36:41.402
Once you were the
source of Mary's power.

36:42.177 --> 36:43.668
Not anymore.

36:44.123 --> 36:47.543
Now t'will be our power
coursing through our sister.

36:48.277 --> 36:51.176
You've never understood the
real meaning of sacrifice.

36:51.974 --> 36:53.707
Nor its power.

36:54.206 --> 36:56.824
No one may sacrifice another.

36:57.877 --> 36:59.871
Only themselves.

37:08.868 --> 37:10.694
No, don't do this!

37:11.591 --> 37:13.006
No, you can't!

37:24.393 --> 37:26.381
No! No!

37:26.859 --> 37:30.647
Ba'al Zabub! Come,
brother! Now! Save me!

37:33.521 --> 37:35.171
Ba'al Zabub!

37:37.692 --> 37:40.811
Brother! Free me! You waste time!

37:41.007 --> 37:43.010
We challenged our father for one reason,

37:43.031 --> 37:44.467
and only one.

37:44.530 --> 37:47.196
Freedom. The right to say no.

37:47.710 --> 37:50.946
And I say it to you
now, brother, freely...

37:52.226 --> 37:55.643
- No.
- I beg of you, do not do this!

37:55.763 --> 37:58.089
I leave you to your fate, Samael.

37:58.380 --> 37:59.641
And come Black Sunday,

37:59.666 --> 38:02.110
which will rain down as black as night,

38:02.135 --> 38:04.797
my true brothers will rise from hell

38:04.822 --> 38:07.157
and stand beside me, not above me.

38:07.522 --> 38:09.922
Don't be a fool. You are but Thursday.

38:09.970 --> 38:12.626
I am Sunday. Black Sunday is my day!

38:12.819 --> 38:14.255
Not anymore.

38:16.724 --> 38:18.469
Mother! Stop!

38:21.366 --> 38:23.743
Mother! Mother!!

38:24.480 --> 38:25.829
I am not your mother.

38:26.024 --> 38:27.766
I am the last of the Essex.

38:27.923 --> 38:29.492
You cannot do this!

38:29.641 --> 38:31.461
We shall be gods together!

38:31.591 --> 38:34.127
Out of all the many, I chose but one!

38:34.278 --> 38:35.818
And out of the one...

38:36.377 --> 38:37.840
I shall make many...

39:47.185 --> 39:49.099
You are a most remarkable woman.

39:49.611 --> 39:51.388
Only because of the remarkable women

39:51.413 --> 39:52.708
who gave themselves for me.

39:52.954 --> 39:54.591
You know it was the only way.

39:55.169 --> 39:56.381
As did they.

39:56.612 --> 39:58.441
And we are far from done.

39:58.911 --> 40:00.966
Black Sunday still looms heavy.

40:01.468 --> 40:03.141
We are free of my son,

40:03.184 --> 40:05.179
but his brother is still here.

40:05.383 --> 40:07.419
And he intends to leave only ashes

40:07.467 --> 40:08.747
where we would have a home.

40:09.686 --> 40:12.263
Wherever you are will be my home.

40:12.651 --> 40:14.544
And whatever I must do to make it so...

40:14.581 --> 40:16.018
shall be done.

40:24.721 --> 40:27.224
# Married on Wednesday #

40:27.397 --> 40:29.599
# Bedded on Thursday #

40:29.866 --> 40:31.927
# Sickened on Friday #

40:32.391 --> 40:34.536
# Died on Saturday #

40:34.796 --> 40:37.633
# Buried on Sunday #
