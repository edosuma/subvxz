00:11.094 --> 00:13.005
Bill, slow down, please.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.011
Stop this. You're scaring me.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.682
I'm sorry.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.347
She promised she was just
gonna look in the window.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.233
I know I made a mistake,
but they're her family.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.985
She is a vampire. She has no family.

00:31.156 --> 00:33.943
I'm a monster and I'm gonna
be alone forever because of you.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.778
I hate you so fucking much.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.238
-Be quiet.
-Eat shit.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.118
I said, be quiet!

00:41.250 --> 00:43.912
You undermined my authority
as her maker.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.960
You risked those peoples' safety
and your own.

00:47.130 --> 00:51.624
lfl had not glamoured them within an inch
of their sanity, our lives would be shattered.

00:51.802 --> 00:54.589
-I know. I'm sorry.
-You keep saying that!

00:54.763 --> 00:57.630
And I am expected to what?
Forget this ever happened?

00:57.808 --> 01:00.299
What else would you like me to say?

01:00.477 --> 01:02.968
I knew when she asked me to take her
I should say no...

01:03.146 --> 01:06.764
...but all I could think about was Gran
and what I'd give to see her again.

01:06.942 --> 01:11.060
That does not give you license
to behave like an irresponsible child!

01:11.238 --> 01:13.149
She is a loaded gun, Sookie.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.655
Not a doll for you to dress up
and play with.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.233
-What are you doing?
-Walking.

01:19.663 --> 01:22.746
Don't be ridiculous.
Bon Temps is nearly 20 miles away.

01:22.916 --> 01:26.625
I'd rather walk all night than spend
another second in that car with you.

01:34.344 --> 01:37.086
She wants you to go after her.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.505
And she wants you to go after her
and kiss her...

01:39.683 --> 01:42.095
...and tell her that you love her.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.181
She will come back.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.514
When she calms down...

01:49.735 --> 01:51.851
...she will come back.

02:09.004 --> 02:10.540
Bill?

02:13.842 --> 02:18.302
If you're trying to scare me so I get back
into that car with you, it isn't gonna work.

02:37.366 --> 02:38.697
What the--?

04:31.396 --> 04:32.977
SooMe!

04:33.356 --> 04:34.687
SooMe.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.348
SooMe.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.354
What did this to you?

04:43.033 --> 04:44.694
Bull-- Human--

04:44.868 --> 04:46.859
I couldn't see.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.281
Bill, I can't move.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.838
SooMe.SooMe.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.133
Oh, gross.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.885
Get the car, now!

05:12.312 --> 05:14.348
-Drive straight home.
-I wanna go with you.

05:14.523 --> 05:17.185
As your maker, I command you.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.832
Sam?

05:37.003 --> 05:38.379
Yeah?

05:42.968 --> 05:44.083
l'm short.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.843
I went over it three times.
I don't know what happened--

05:47.013 --> 05:48.594
How much?

05:49.099 --> 05:52.432
Sixty-four dollars and, like, eight cents.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.601
Goddamn it, Daphne,
you're gonna have to pay for it.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.104
I'm sorry, but this is a business.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.272
There.

06:08.326 --> 06:11.113
That's all the tips that I made tonight...

06:11.288 --> 06:13.779
...so I'm just gonna have
to owe you the rest.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.874
Fuck.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.784
Fuck.

06:21.673 --> 06:25.131
You can't expect her to learn if you don't
give her positive reinforcement.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.588
-Tara, not now.
-l'm serious.

06:27.762 --> 06:31.129
Nobody succeeds at anything in life
unless somebody believes in them.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.799
Let me guess. Maryann say that?

06:33.977 --> 06:36.889
What is it with you and Maryann?
What's she ever done to you...

06:37.063 --> 06:40.100
...other than just drop almost
$300 in your bar tonight?

06:40.275 --> 06:42.812
I don't want her in here anymore.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.274
And if I were you,
I'd stay the hell away from her.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.735
-You don't even know this person.
-Neither do you.

07:13.850 --> 07:18.184
-What kind of doctor are you?
-The healing kind.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.141
l'm Dr. Ludwig, what's your--?

07:20.690 --> 07:21.770
SooMe.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.516
Sookie Stackhouse.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.982
-Am I dying?
-Yes.

07:28.323 --> 07:31.156
No, she cannot die. You will save her.

07:31.326 --> 07:33.658
Back off, vampire. Let me do my job.

07:34.037 --> 07:37.575
Forgive him. Bill is abnormally
attached to this human.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.991
Well, we don't have a lot of choices,
she's been poisoned.

07:41.378 --> 07:44.040
You ever heard of Komodo dragons?

07:44.214 --> 07:46.205
Their mouths are teeming with bacteria.

07:46.716 --> 07:50.459
After one has bitten you,
it will track you for hours, days...

07:50.637 --> 07:54.221
...just waiting for the toxins to slowly
eat away at your nervous system...

07:54.391 --> 07:57.724
...till you're good and helpless,
then it will devour you alive.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.226
l was scratched by a dragon?

08:00.397 --> 08:04.310
No, but this poison is similar,
but way more efficient.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.226
Don't think I've seen it.
It's hard to tell without testing...

08:07.404 --> 08:09.235
...and we don't have that kind of time.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.740
Give us some privacy.
I need to remove her clothing.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.079
I will be just outside.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.702
I am so sorry.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.247
She's running out of time,
Mr. Compton.

08:31.428 --> 08:34.591
-Head of a bull.
-That's what she said.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.722
It was dark. It all happened in seconds.

08:37.892 --> 08:41.384
So you didn't see this bull man?

08:42.397 --> 08:45.059
-No.
-And you gave her your blood?

08:46.234 --> 08:47.940
It didn't work.

08:48.278 --> 08:51.520
-You ever heard of anything like this?
-Surprisingly, no.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.532
Pam. Chow.

08:58.329 --> 09:01.992
I thought in over a thousand years
I'd seen everything there was to see.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.755
Search the woods around Highway 71.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.299
He can do it.
I'm wearing my favorite pumps.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.383
She is extremely lazy...

09:18.558 --> 09:20.173
...but loyal.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.809
How's yours? Jessica.

09:22.979 --> 09:26.813
Petulant. Dangerous. Afraid.

09:27.484 --> 09:30.191
I'm glad to see you two are bonding.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.477
Being a good maker is very rewarding.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.148
-l have to get back to Sookie.
-Oh, relax.

09:36.326 --> 09:39.989
Dr. Ludwig treated one of Pam's humans
when he was mauled by a werewolf.

09:40.163 --> 09:42.279
Lost an eye, but othen/vise he's fine.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.328
-What are you doing to her?
-Hold her down!

09:49.798 --> 09:51.663
Or let her die, your choice.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.258
Stop!

09:57.639 --> 09:59.004
Stop!

10:27.043 --> 10:29.785
You're so warm.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.371
And I'm so cold.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.915
-Eddie.
-What are you doing here, Jason?

10:35.093 --> 10:37.550
I thought we were friends.

10:38.221 --> 10:42.009
You're fucking dead. I saw you die.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.175
This ain't real. This ain't real.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.637
Does this feel real?

11:05.582 --> 11:07.288
Dear God...

11:07.917 --> 11:10.579
...you gotta help me out, because...

11:10.753 --> 11:13.665
...I don't know what's right
and wrong no more.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.999
Maybe I never did.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.300
Just--

11:20.221 --> 11:22.303
God, please.

11:22.473 --> 11:25.385
Please, give me another sign.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.050
Because”.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.677
...l'm lost.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.852
I'm so fucking lost.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.392
There's your sign.

11:36.571 --> 11:39.438
Now shut up.
Some of us are trying to sleep in here.

11:57.967 --> 12:01.710
You can give her blood now.
Her body should accept it.

12:03.598 --> 12:06.465
Mine is much stronger. Allow me.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.349
Never.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.649
Sookie, can you hear me?
You must drink.

12:25.370 --> 12:28.988
l'll expect my payment
by the end of the week.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.500
It's always a pleasure
doing business with you.

12:34.671 --> 12:37.504
-Fuck off.
-Clearly the pleasure is one-sided.

12:38.216 --> 12:41.003
She's no fan of the fang.

12:41.177 --> 12:45.591
She tolerates us because our blood
is of such great value to healers.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.141
Now, careful. You'll overcook her.

12:53.356 --> 12:55.017
All right.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.193
-All right.
-Thank you.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.279
The area has been scanned.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.369
Tracks were human,
but the smell was distinctly animal.

13:14.544 --> 13:15.624
What kind?

13:15.795 --> 13:17.877
-A filthy one.
-We didn't recognize it.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.127
How intriguing.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.540
Send an alert through
the appropriate channels.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.959
Find out what the neighbors know.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.211
And, Pam...

13:28.224 --> 13:29.509
...those were great pumps.

13:36.566 --> 13:39.148
-I don't wanna move her.
-Of course not.

13:39.569 --> 13:42.902
-|'|| make sure she's taken care of.
-l'm not leaving her.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.981
Longshadow kept a coffin in back.

13:46.159 --> 13:49.743
He liked to feed before resting,
so it might be a bit messy...

13:49.912 --> 13:51.743
...but you're welcome to it.

13:54.292 --> 13:57.375
I wanna thank you for your hospitality.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.081
And for saving Sookie's life.

13:59.255 --> 14:02.338
I'm sure there's a way she can repay me.

14:22.070 --> 14:25.107
That's delicious, Karl.
Could use a little more juniper.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.647
Yes. Yes, of course. You're right.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.123
What's all this?

14:41.589 --> 14:43.750
Oh, I'm having a few people over.

14:43.925 --> 14:45.256
How many people?

14:45.426 --> 14:47.212
You know, I don't remember.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.629
-Karl will make you breakfast.
-That's okay.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.389
I'm more of a breakfast-for—lunch
kind of girl.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.801
But coffee's great. Thanks, Karl.

14:58.648 --> 15:03.517
I don't think I'll ever get used to people
just doing things without me even asking.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.066
Karl knows that if he wants
to find fulfillment in life...

15:07.240 --> 15:08.980
...he needs to learn to be of service.

15:09.158 --> 15:12.241
So everything he does for us
is really a selfish act.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.743
Maryann, why does Sam hate you?

15:15.373 --> 15:16.613
Sam hates me?

15:16.916 --> 15:19.658
Practically jumped down my throat
after you left last night.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.828
Kept saying I need to stay away from you.
Why would he say that?

15:24.257 --> 15:25.667
Well....

15:25.842 --> 15:29.585
I mean, I barely know the man...

15:30.596 --> 15:33.338
...but if I had to guess, I'd say jealousy.

15:33.516 --> 15:34.972
-You two have a history.
-Yeah...

15:35.143 --> 15:37.475
...but we're better as friends
than sleeping together.

15:37.645 --> 15:38.680
We both know that.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.019
Tara.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.181
Still not valuing yourself.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.355
You are a fantastic woman.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.107
Sam lost you.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.281
He's just looking for someone to blame.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.650
But why you?

15:55.538 --> 15:57.529
Because you've moved on.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.119
And hopefully I've been a part
of making that happen.

16:01.294 --> 16:05.003
Sam seems like a sensitive,
wonderful guy...

16:05.840 --> 16:09.628
...but all my instincts scream "unevolved."

16:10.636 --> 16:12.797
You're right.
That man has way too many issues.

16:13.181 --> 16:15.217
And they are not your problem.

16:16.100 --> 16:20.719
Unlike Karl, you've done enough
taking care of people to last a lifetime.

16:21.230 --> 16:24.222
Holy shit, that's beautiful.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.560
It's even got a filter?

16:26.068 --> 16:28.229
Little technique I picked up in Ibiza.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.019
Adorable, isn't it?

16:33.117 --> 16:36.325
Oh, fuck it.
I don't have to be at work till 4.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.838
Hey, Terry.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.253
Thanks for coming.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.259
You taking a trip?

16:59.227 --> 17:01.013
Something like that.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.678
-Where to?
-Not sure yet.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.814
Well, I ain't been a lot of places...

17:06.984 --> 17:09.475
...but better here
than all the places I've been.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.440
Yeah.

17:11.614 --> 17:14.777
Hey, so listen, I was hoping
you'd take care of the bar for me.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.691
You know, just till I get back.

17:17.912 --> 17:19.652
Yeah....

17:20.248 --> 17:22.330
I don't know, Sam.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.788
I like cooking.
It's quiet back there and....

17:26.629 --> 17:29.041
I ain't so good with people.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.131
If I were you,
I wouldn't be my first choice.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.337
Well, actually, you're not.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.468
I can't reach Sookie.

17:36.931 --> 17:39.263
And who knows where the hell
Lafayette is.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.303
Arlene's got enough on her plate.

17:41.477 --> 17:43.263
-And Tara--
-Don't like the pressure.

17:43.437 --> 17:44.893
Tara's--

17:45.648 --> 17:48.390
She's going through
some personal stuff right now.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.559
So you're all I got.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.485
Will you do it for me, buddy?

17:54.031 --> 17:56.488
Well, I guess I ain't got no choice.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.949
I appreciate it.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.823
Appreciate it.
I'll get you a set of keys after closing.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.325
So you're just gonna cut and run.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.373
Just like that.

18:09.964 --> 18:11.249
I'm not running.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.841
Remind me never to get stuck
in a foxhole with you.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.014
Coward.

18:29.275 --> 18:32.358
He used me up...

18:32.945 --> 18:35.357
...till he got bored...

18:36.240 --> 18:39.027
...and then he left me to die.

18:42.913 --> 18:45.700
I thought he loved me...

18:45.875 --> 18:47.786
...but I was nothing...

18:47.960 --> 18:53.796
...but his living, breathing
snack machine.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.460
Thank you for sharing your story, Missy.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.886
That was very brave.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.764
May his holy light shine on you.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.060
Praise his light.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.559
Praise his light.

19:07.730 --> 19:10.392
Jason? Is there something
you'd like to share?

19:10.566 --> 19:12.727
No, thank you.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.400
I ain't much of a sharing kind of guy.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.857
Remember, we all signed
a vow of honesty.

19:18.032 --> 19:20.899
-That's right.
-Are you wearing your honesty ring?

19:22.411 --> 19:23.571
Yeah.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.582
All right, but you ain't gonna like it.

19:30.753 --> 19:34.120
Pretty much goes against
everything y'all have been saying.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.913
You're safe here.

19:39.762 --> 19:42.504
I ain't a vampire victim.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.594
The fact is,
they've never done nothing against me.

19:45.768 --> 19:47.554
My sister's dating one...

19:47.728 --> 19:51.061
...and from everything I can tell,
he seems to treat her pretty decent.

19:51.232 --> 19:54.269
Well, except for the biting,
but I think she likes that.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.693
-Oh, no, please.
-What?

19:58.906 --> 20:00.442
Go on.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.781
My girlfriend, she staked
a vampire right in front of me.

20:11.168 --> 20:15.582
His name was Eddie, and he was gay...

20:16.465 --> 20:19.081
...but he was a real nice person.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.421
He wasn't a person, Jason.

20:22.805 --> 20:25.672
-A person wouldn't do that.
-That's right.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.215
Would they?

20:29.562 --> 20:33.396
Well, my Gran and my girlfriend
were killed by my best friend...

20:33.566 --> 20:36.524
...just because he had a problem
with vampires.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.436
And he was a person.

20:48.414 --> 20:53.329
Look, I'm only here because
I thought God wanted me to be.

20:53.502 --> 20:57.461
Thought maybe he had a purpose for me.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.883
Some shit like that.

21:00.050 --> 21:03.178
Beginning to see
that was just wishful thinking.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.089
No, Jason, wait.

21:05.723 --> 21:08.385
-Becky, take over for a second?
-Sure.

21:08.559 --> 21:09.674
Let's pray.

21:10.603 --> 21:14.016
-Hey, Jason. Just talk to me.
-There ain't nothing to talk about.

21:14.190 --> 21:18.103
The first time I laid eyes on you, I knew
there was something special about this one.

21:18.277 --> 21:22.190
I knew the Lord had sent you to me,
but it wasn't till today that I knew why.

21:22.364 --> 21:25.026
-Why?
-Because we're so much alike.

21:26.202 --> 21:27.533
Sarah....

21:28.204 --> 21:31.446
No, we wanna see
the best in others so badly...

21:31.624 --> 21:34.366
...that sometimes we overlook the worst.

21:35.753 --> 21:37.994
Yeah, that kind of does sound like me.

21:38.172 --> 21:41.380
When the vampires
came out of the coffin...

21:43.344 --> 21:46.882
...I went with my big sister Amber
to march for their equal rights.

21:48.349 --> 21:51.967
-Really?
-Two months later, Amber disappeared.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.552
Got hooked on V.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.186
I know they killed her.

21:56.357 --> 21:59.144
Got rid of her body
in whatever way they do.

22:01.529 --> 22:03.315
I'm sorry.

22:04.490 --> 22:07.323
They stole my sister, Jason.

22:08.327 --> 22:12.536
The same way they stole your girlfriend
and your grandmother.

22:13.207 --> 22:17.041
And I know you believe Eddie
was your friend, but think about it.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.749
If his kind never existed,
the people you love would still be alive.

22:22.383 --> 22:24.123
Well, you're saying...

22:24.301 --> 22:27.634
...ifl hadn't been too messed up
to protect them, they'd still be here?

22:27.805 --> 22:30.672
No, you're just human, but vampires...

22:31.100 --> 22:33.887
Everything they are,
down to their very blood...

22:34.061 --> 22:35.267
...is seductive.

22:37.648 --> 22:39.058
God.

22:39.233 --> 22:42.521
God, I should have done something.

22:44.572 --> 22:47.359
To save Gran, Amy.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.524
All of them.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.489
I know how much it hurts.

22:52.663 --> 22:54.278
Trust me, that's why...

22:54.456 --> 22:58.620
...if we can protect even one family
from this kind of suffering...

22:58.794 --> 23:02.958
...then all the loved ones we've lost,
their deaths won't have been for nothing.

23:06.927 --> 23:09.134
You know, sometimes...

23:12.516 --> 23:13.972
...I wish I was dead too.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.259
But you're not.

23:16.437 --> 23:18.428
God needs you.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.312
93» 2% 375-15

23:20.482 --> 23:23.940
You don't have to carry
this alone anymore.

23:24.111 --> 23:26.648
Give yourself to his light.

23:27.281 --> 23:30.114
Let him carry this pain for you.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.533
Pray with me?

23:33.996 --> 23:35.827
Okay.

23:42.713 --> 23:46.126
Heavenly Father, bless Jason...

23:46.300 --> 23:49.007
...and protect his sister...

23:49.178 --> 23:53.421
...and all those who are still out there
lost in the darkness.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.972
You're awake.

24:34.431 --> 24:36.046
I made you a tube-top sandwich.

24:37.142 --> 24:39.474
Peanut butter and chocolate syrup.

24:39.645 --> 24:42.978
That's very thoughtful, Ginger.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.398
Oh, that's the thing about
being with vamps, ain't it?

24:46.568 --> 24:48.559
You always forget to eat.

24:49.029 --> 24:51.896
I've lost 37 pounds since I got thisjob.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.701
Way better than a fat farm.

24:56.578 --> 25:00.366
-Did Bill leave?
-Oh, he's resting in back, I think.

25:00.749 --> 25:02.705
Do they make you stay here every day?

25:02.876 --> 25:05.083
Well, sometimes Ijust
come in for deliveries...

25:05.254 --> 25:07.245
...but these days
I've been coming in for--

25:11.218 --> 25:12.924
Never mind all that.

25:13.095 --> 25:16.428
You just finish up your sandwich
and go back to sleep.

25:16.598 --> 25:19.260
God, I almost told her
how they threw Lafayette in the basement.

25:19.435 --> 25:20.675
Eric says I can 't tell her.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.844
Lafayette?

25:23.022 --> 25:25.104
Why would Eric have Lafayette
in the basement?

25:25.274 --> 25:26.730
I just work here.

25:27.443 --> 25:30.731
Please don 't make me use that gun
under the cash register. Fuck.

25:35.242 --> 25:36.948
Take me to him.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.280
Now.

25:52.551 --> 25:53.711
Oh, my God.

25:56.847 --> 25:58.712
Lafayette.

25:58.891 --> 26:02.634
-Lafayette.
-Sook, is that really you?

26:03.020 --> 26:04.601
What have they done to you?

26:05.564 --> 26:07.270
Do I look like a vampire?

26:07.816 --> 26:09.352
You look awful.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.391
I feel fucking worse.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.856
I guess that means
I ain't a vampire then...

26:14.031 --> 26:16.147
...which is good.

26:16.450 --> 26:17.610
Uncuff him.

26:17.785 --> 26:18.991
I don't have that key.

26:19.787 --> 26:21.402
I swear.

26:21.580 --> 26:25.289
Eric's gonna be so mad at me.
jesus have mercy.

26:25.459 --> 26:27.666
I'm gonna get you out of here.

26:27.836 --> 26:29.497
I promise.

26:37.012 --> 26:38.343
That's a new song?

26:38.514 --> 26:40.175
Yeah, well.

26:40.349 --> 26:43.091
I didn't get serious till recently,
so I got a lot to learn.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.429
Sounded pretty good to me.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.937
Yeah? Thanks.
Ijust, you know, I love music.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.019
I just wasted most of my life...

26:51.193 --> 26:53.809
...trying to avoid doing the shit
I love the most.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.523
Why?

26:55.697 --> 26:59.690
I guess I just felt like....

27:02.162 --> 27:05.996
If I was good at something,
it was probably just a waste of time...

27:06.166 --> 27:09.033
...and if it felt good
I probably didn't deserve it.

27:10.379 --> 27:14.418
You know, a couple days after
Maryann took me in...

27:14.591 --> 27:19.051
...she put this guitar in my hands,
and I cried like a fucking baby.

27:20.639 --> 27:23.176
It was the first time in my life
anybody's actually...

27:23.350 --> 27:24.965
...encouraged me to do anything.

27:25.936 --> 27:27.392
So....

27:27.563 --> 27:29.053
I'm sorry, I--

27:29.231 --> 27:31.392
Don't apologize.

27:32.776 --> 27:36.485
Only thing my mama ever encouraged me
to learn was how to pour whiskey.

27:38.866 --> 27:40.731
Oh, fuck me.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.490
What?

27:43.579 --> 27:45.365
-What?
-I was supposed to be at work...

27:45.539 --> 27:47.404
...45 minutes ago.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.495
I can give you a ride now.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.250
How many of those have you had?

27:52.796 --> 27:54.206
Four?

27:54.381 --> 27:57.919
I think one DUI between us
is enough, don't you?

27:58.093 --> 28:01.756
Besides, I am way too fucked up
to deal with Sam Merlotte right now.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.928
Well, is he gonna fire you?

28:04.099 --> 28:05.600
Maybe, but it's just a job.

28:05.767 --> 28:08.600
And I go through those as fast
as I go through relationships.

28:09.104 --> 28:12.767
-Maybe you haven't found the right one yet.
-|'ve had a lot ofjobs.

28:12.941 --> 28:15.023
I ain't talking about that shit.

28:35.672 --> 28:37.378
You still angry about our fight?

28:38.217 --> 28:42.711
-Sookie, none of that matters anymore.
-You're right. I'm alive and in one piece.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.219
Unlike my friend Lafayette...

28:44.389 --> 28:47.802
...who Eric chained up like an animal
and left to bleed to death.

28:47.976 --> 28:48.965
What?

28:49.144 --> 28:52.307
You better not have known anything
about this, because if you did...

28:52.481 --> 28:54.767
...I don't think I could ever forgive you.

28:54.942 --> 28:57.058
I have no idea what you're talking about.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.397
She's referring to the human
in my basement.

28:59.571 --> 29:02.108
The human that traded
sexual services with a vampire...

29:02.282 --> 29:03.738
...in order to sell his blood.

29:03.909 --> 29:06.150
Which, as you know, is a grave offense.

29:06.328 --> 29:08.239
His name is Lafayette.

29:08.413 --> 29:11.405
You ought to be ashamed of yourself
for what you've done to him.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.081
SooMe.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.331
I'm glad you're feeling better.

29:17.506 --> 29:20.248
And may I add,
that color suits you very well.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.131
-Go to hell.
-Sookie, enough.

29:22.302 --> 29:24.133
Oh, it's not nearly enough.

29:24.304 --> 29:26.920
They've tortured him
and bitten him and shot him...

29:27.099 --> 29:30.808
...and kept him down there
in his own filth for weeks.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.635
Is this true?

29:32.813 --> 29:35.350
Others would have done far worse,
and you know it.

29:35.524 --> 29:37.890
You're gonna let him go right now...

29:38.068 --> 29:40.354
...or I swear I'm going to the police.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.821
I do not respond well to threats.

29:50.872 --> 29:54.205
But perhaps we can come
to some sort of arrangement.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.374
Please.

30:01.008 --> 30:02.464
Hey, Tara.

30:02.634 --> 30:05.842
So I guess you're not coming in tonight.

30:06.221 --> 30:07.381
I get it.

30:07.556 --> 30:11.549
You're pissed at me
for what I said about Maryann.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.592
Look...

30:13.770 --> 30:17.058
...Tara, I know you're smart, tough,
and you can take care of yourself.

30:17.232 --> 30:19.894
And that's all I'm asking you to do.

30:20.068 --> 30:22.559
Okay? Just keep your eyes open.

30:23.113 --> 30:26.526
And take a good look
at the people around you.

30:27.075 --> 30:29.817
And be careful, okay? Just be careful.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.737
I know. I know I'm late, I'm sorry...

30:33.915 --> 30:37.078
...but Lisa decided to give Coby
a nose piercing...

30:39.421 --> 30:41.002
Well, now he's got an infection--

30:41.173 --> 30:44.210
It's okay, Arlene.
Just go ahead and get changed.

30:45.844 --> 30:50.087
-Is everything all right with you, Sam?
-Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine.

30:51.058 --> 30:53.470
I thought Sookie's supposed
to be working tonight.

30:53.643 --> 30:57.181
Oh, yeah, she was.
She called and asked me to cover for her.

30:57.898 --> 31:00.355
Lord knows I owe her one after....

31:00.525 --> 31:01.605
You know.

31:04.446 --> 31:07.813
Nice and understanding
looks good on you, Sam.

31:50.992 --> 31:52.448
Hello?

31:56.957 --> 31:58.993
Anybody home?

32:03.755 --> 32:04.835
Bill?

32:07.884 --> 32:09.465
SooMe.

32:41.376 --> 32:43.458
Hot chick, 2 o'clock.

33:33.303 --> 33:34.588
Hi.

33:35.138 --> 33:36.253
Hi.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.388
You mind if I join you?

33:40.727 --> 33:42.592
|-- I mean, if you're alone.

33:43.939 --> 33:45.725
I'm alone.

33:52.239 --> 33:53.604
Hi, I'm Hoyt.

33:53.949 --> 33:55.655
Jessica.

33:56.368 --> 34:01.738
So this might sound kind of funny,
but I was just sitting there thinking:

34:02.207 --> 34:06.826
"How come you don't ever
meet a nice girl, Hoyt?"

34:08.755 --> 34:11.792
And then you just walked right in.

34:12.968 --> 34:15.050
And how do you know I'm a nice girl?

34:15.220 --> 34:17.757
Because of your smile, I guess.

34:19.015 --> 34:22.803
You can tell a lot about someone
by the way that they smile, and....

34:23.728 --> 34:26.640
You know, I watch people all the time.

34:28.483 --> 34:30.314
You see? Oh, like that.

34:32.612 --> 34:34.568
That's beautiful.

34:35.740 --> 34:38.117
I could just--
I could stare at that all day long.

34:39.995 --> 34:41.576
Day?

34:41.746 --> 34:42.997
Yeah, right.

34:44.541 --> 34:45.826
Did I say something wrong?

34:47.002 --> 34:49.744
No. Of course not.

34:49.921 --> 34:52.537
Okay. Okay, good,
because I don't wanna...

34:52.716 --> 34:54.001
...scare you away or--

34:54.968 --> 34:58.506
Would you like a drink or some--?
Or food?

34:59.306 --> 35:00.921
You hungry?

35:01.349 --> 35:04.682
You should try the chicken fried steak,
because it's--

35:04.853 --> 35:08.266
It's like a chicken and a steak
got together and made a baby.

35:09.190 --> 35:10.350
This delicious...

35:10.525 --> 35:13.187
...crispy little baby, and....

35:24.372 --> 35:26.283
I'll just have a bottle of Tru Blood.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.370
B positive.

35:37.844 --> 35:39.380
You're a vampire?

35:43.475 --> 35:44.715
For real?

35:50.774 --> 35:53.561
Wow, that is awesome.

35:58.365 --> 36:01.323
A bottle of Tru Blood, coming right up.

36:08.917 --> 36:11.499
So if I agree to go to Dallas...

36:11.670 --> 36:14.582
...to look for this missing vampire,
you'll let Lafayette go?

36:14.756 --> 36:17.589
No, you nearly died last night.
You are not going to Dallas.

36:17.759 --> 36:19.670
Bill, I can make up my own mind.

36:19.844 --> 36:22.096
I will pay all of your expenses,
of course.

36:22.263 --> 36:25.005
And, yes, I will release your friend.

36:25.433 --> 36:27.719
And I want $5000.

36:28.770 --> 36:32.012
I've missed a lot of work
and I need a driveway.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.727
Your human is getting cocky.

36:35.235 --> 36:37.442
She will take 10,000,
and I will escort her.

36:37.612 --> 36:40.194
-I don't think so, no.
-Yes.

36:40.365 --> 36:44.278
Ten thousand and Bill comes with me
or it's a deal breaker.

36:51.084 --> 36:54.451
You surprise me.
And that is a rare quality in a breather.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.039
You disgust me.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.296
-Perhaps I'll grow on you.
-I'd prefer cancer.

37:00.468 --> 37:03.460
-You need to leave immediately.
-I will make travel arrangements...

37:03.638 --> 37:06.220
...but I will need
your credit-card number.

37:09.477 --> 37:12.969
Such a shame. I was hoping I could
convince Eric to let me keep you.

37:13.148 --> 37:14.934
No, you already have enough pets.

37:15.108 --> 37:18.225
No offense, but you ain't
exactly my type, bitch.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.234
-Can I kick him?
-You can try.

37:20.405 --> 37:23.317
Enough. Have Chow fetch their car.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.753
I'll see you around, I'm sure.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.834
Oh, don't bet on it, baby.

37:41.843 --> 37:43.458
I'm retiring.

37:43.636 --> 37:47.003
I'm done with you crazy-ass fuckers.

37:47.474 --> 37:49.010
Done.

38:03.531 --> 38:07.490
-It tastes good.
-This is the best soup I have ever had.

38:32.018 --> 38:35.055
Right when I thought this party
couldn't get any fucking weirder...

38:35.230 --> 38:36.845
...look who shows up.

38:37.023 --> 38:40.732
You'd think Andy'd have better shit to do,
like, I don't know, solve a murder.

38:40.902 --> 38:43.860
Well, you know what they say
about all work and no play.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.237
Seems like you're pretty familiar
with the idea.

38:46.407 --> 38:49.649
It's your fault I missed work
in the first place.

38:50.203 --> 38:52.740
You're just too damn distracting.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.663
-Mike Spencer?
-Howdy, Andy.

39:02.841 --> 39:03.876
Great party, huh?

39:04.050 --> 39:07.338
Less talking. More dancing.

39:07.512 --> 39:13.098
Damn, Jane Bodehouse,
you are one fiery little hellcat.

39:14.394 --> 39:15.884
Come on.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.859
What you doing in there, pig?

39:32.453 --> 39:34.444
Detective Bellefleur?

39:35.164 --> 39:37.075
I'm so glad you made it.

39:37.250 --> 39:40.458
Actually, I'm here because there's been
complaints about the noise.

39:41.754 --> 39:43.585
They sent their best detective
to deal with it?

39:43.756 --> 39:45.542
Well, I am flattered.

39:45.717 --> 39:49.460
But Sheriff Dearborne should really
put your talents to better use.

39:49.637 --> 39:53.095
-|'|| go turn off that music right away.
-Hate to be a party pooper...

39:53.266 --> 39:55.427
...but you got a livestock permit
for that pig?

39:56.769 --> 39:59.146
-What pig?
-That pig.

39:59.314 --> 40:02.477
I don't know what you're talking about.

40:04.777 --> 40:07.314
It was there a second ago.

40:07.488 --> 40:09.774
-Have you been drinking?
-No, damn it.

40:09.949 --> 40:12.156
I know what I saw.

40:12.327 --> 40:14.488
I know what I saw, I'm a good cop.

40:14.662 --> 40:17.825
Of course you are.

40:18.875 --> 40:20.740
Everybody knows that.

40:20.919 --> 40:24.582
Here. Why don't you stay
and relax a little bit.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.336
Just one.

40:29.510 --> 40:31.341
I am on the clock.

40:31.512 --> 40:33.173
Come on.

40:33.890 --> 40:35.801
Yes, God is love.

40:35.975 --> 40:38.261
He's the force of love.

40:38.436 --> 40:43.681
But how do we respond to forces
that block, undermine and destroy love?

40:43.858 --> 40:46.349
Well, you cannot love evil.

40:46.527 --> 40:48.688
You have to hate it.

40:48.863 --> 40:52.856
So hating evil is really...

40:53.201 --> 40:54.987
...loving good.

40:55.161 --> 40:56.526
Good.

40:57.413 --> 40:59.529
I never really thought about it that way.

40:59.707 --> 41:01.208
Hate isn'tjust natural, Jason.

41:01.376 --> 41:04.743
We need it in order to survive.

41:05.546 --> 41:08.583
My father dedicated his life to God...

41:08.758 --> 41:11.295
...to protecting the human race.

41:11.469 --> 41:15.712
And they murdered him and his wife
and my baby sister in cold blood.

41:17.642 --> 41:19.883
They're baby killers.

41:20.853 --> 41:22.559
That's what they're capable of.

41:23.690 --> 41:26.056
Now, if I didn't hate vampires...

41:26.234 --> 41:31.069
...and do everything in my power
to avenge my family's death...

41:32.448 --> 41:34.609
...what kind of man would I be?

41:36.995 --> 41:39.987
-A pretty bad one.
-Yeah.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.702
And what's going on out there is a war.

41:43.876 --> 41:46.208
Not right now, Jason...

41:46.546 --> 41:48.411
...but in general.

41:48.589 --> 41:50.420
And we all gotta choose sides.

41:51.050 --> 41:54.508
Now, you're either on the side of darkness
or the side of light.

41:54.929 --> 41:57.261
-Light.
-There's no in-between.

41:57.432 --> 41:59.844
Hope you boys saved room
for some banana pudding.

42:00.018 --> 42:01.178
Oh, thanks, honey.

42:01.352 --> 42:03.764
Oh, Sarah's pudding
is a little slice of heaven.

42:03.938 --> 42:06.224
Don't go bragging on me
in front of the company.

42:06.399 --> 42:09.266
Well, you stop being such an angel
and maybe I will.

42:16.117 --> 42:18.028
I'm gonna go get the whipped cream.

42:26.294 --> 42:29.286
You know, my wife must think
you're pretty special.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.083
Really?

42:31.257 --> 42:34.420
Well, Sarah doesn't whip out
her pudding forjust anybody.

42:37.972 --> 42:40.634
God's got great things in store
for you, Jason Stackhouse.

42:40.808 --> 42:42.673
Can you feel it?

42:43.519 --> 42:45.100
Yeah.

42:45.772 --> 42:47.808
Yeah, I feel it.

43:01.120 --> 43:05.159
I always wanted to see the inside
of Vampire Bill's house.

43:08.377 --> 43:10.242
So you get to live here?

43:13.591 --> 43:15.092
It's pretty cool.

43:15.510 --> 43:17.250
Not really.

43:17.428 --> 43:20.044
I mean, it's full of his creepy old stuff.

43:20.223 --> 43:21.759
And he makes me sleep in a hole.

43:22.183 --> 43:23.764
Yeah.

43:24.185 --> 43:27.018
My mama keeps her doll collection
in my closet.

43:31.192 --> 43:32.352
Oh, you got a Wii?

43:32.944 --> 43:36.436
-A what?
-A W-- You never played a Wii?

43:37.406 --> 43:39.192
Oh, you'll love it.

43:41.869 --> 43:44.406
Yeah, so you can race cars...

43:45.039 --> 43:46.700
...or you can play tennis...

43:48.126 --> 43:52.085
...or you can dance.

43:55.424 --> 43:57.210
Or you can shoot people.

43:58.386 --> 44:01.549
-Well, I've never done any of that.
-Well, here, I'll show you.

44:01.722 --> 44:04.384
So-- May I?

44:05.268 --> 44:07.475
Okay. So these are the controllers.

44:07.645 --> 44:09.727
You just hold that like that.

44:40.469 --> 44:43.427
No. No, don't do that.

44:45.391 --> 44:48.098
You don't have to hide that from me,
that's natural.

44:48.269 --> 44:49.759
How can you say that?

44:50.271 --> 44:52.262
I mean, I have fangs.

44:52.440 --> 44:55.022
And they just come out
and I can't control them, and--

44:58.112 --> 44:59.477
This is so embarrassing.

44:59.655 --> 45:01.771
I'd die if I wasn't already dead.

45:05.286 --> 45:07.402
Don't be embarrassed
about what you are.

45:10.458 --> 45:12.915
Because what you are...

45:13.961 --> 45:15.041
...is great.

45:17.298 --> 45:18.788
You think I'm great?

45:20.718 --> 45:22.128
I like you.

45:25.223 --> 45:27.134
I like you a lot.

45:29.018 --> 45:32.385
And that's why I think
we ought to wait...

45:32.563 --> 45:36.932
...you know, before we do anything else.

45:41.072 --> 45:43.609
I've waited too long already.

45:52.375 --> 45:54.491
You sure we can't take you
to the hospital?

45:54.669 --> 45:58.378
Three jobs and I still ain't got
no health insurance.

45:58.547 --> 46:01.675
Besides, the bullet went straight through.

46:01.842 --> 46:04.128
I'll get my uncle to stitch it up
in the morning.

46:04.470 --> 46:05.971
Your uncle the veterinarian?

46:06.138 --> 46:09.676
He chops off steer nuts for a living,
I think he can handle a few stitches.

46:10.685 --> 46:13.176
Don't worry, Sook. I'm fine.

46:13.479 --> 46:14.844
You don't look fine.

46:15.022 --> 46:19.015
Far as I'm concerned,
I spent the last two weeks at Club Med...

46:19.193 --> 46:21.855
...drinking a margarita
and getting my chest waxed.

46:25.866 --> 46:28.653
And I appreciate it
if you tell your friends...

46:28.828 --> 46:30.318
...that's how I'll remember it.

46:31.205 --> 46:32.706
That would be wise.

46:34.041 --> 46:36.418
-At least let Bill help you inside.
-No.

46:36.585 --> 46:38.200
Sook, I said I'm fine.

47:59.085 --> 48:00.291
I used to get so mad...

48:00.461 --> 48:03.953
...when people judged vampires
just for being different.

48:04.131 --> 48:05.792
It's like they were judging me too.

48:07.802 --> 48:13.968
I told myself their fear
was nothing but small-mindedness...

48:14.141 --> 48:17.178
...but maybe that's just
what I wanted to believe.

48:17.770 --> 48:20.637
Because the more open my mind gets...

48:21.524 --> 48:23.981
...the more evil I see.

48:25.861 --> 48:27.476
SooMe”.

48:28.155 --> 48:30.191
...most of us...

48:30.699 --> 48:33.862
...vampire, human, or othen/vise...

48:34.036 --> 48:37.449
...are capable of both good and evil.

48:38.666 --> 48:40.031
Often simultaneously.

48:40.209 --> 48:44.077
You can't expect me to believe
that Eric's capable of anything good.

48:44.255 --> 48:46.746
Not after how he tortured Lafayette.

48:47.299 --> 48:49.005
I have had worse sheriffs.

48:49.301 --> 48:52.088
I don't understand
how you can defend him.

48:53.764 --> 48:55.629
He saved your life.

48:55.808 --> 48:57.673
I can still hate him.

48:58.686 --> 49:03.726
I hate that he may be putting you
in harm's way once again...

49:04.233 --> 49:05.894
...for his own selfish reasons.

49:08.195 --> 49:10.857
And I hate that he has shown you
the barbarousness...

49:11.031 --> 49:14.159
...that we call justice.

49:16.370 --> 49:18.952
If I could glamour it away for you...

49:19.123 --> 49:20.863
...I would.

49:21.459 --> 49:23.495
I'm glad you can't.

49:23.669 --> 49:26.536
I'm sick of things sneaking up on me.

49:26.714 --> 49:30.548
Rene and whatever the hell that was
that attacked me last night.

49:32.219 --> 49:34.631
If I'm never gonna be safe...

49:35.139 --> 49:37.505
...l'd rather know what to be afraid of.

49:44.231 --> 49:46.517
Well, after last night...

49:46.775 --> 49:49.312
...I hope that that doesn't include me.

49:55.409 --> 49:58.116
I know there's darkness in you.

50:00.247 --> 50:02.329
I know there is.

50:03.250 --> 50:06.208
And it scares the life out of me.

50:08.839 --> 50:10.500
But you're right.

50:12.801 --> 50:15.338
There's goodness in you too.

50:17.806 --> 50:20.388
And when I look in your eyes...

50:21.769 --> 50:23.805
...that's what I see.

50:35.407 --> 50:39.776
I feel so unbelievably
fucking good right now.

50:40.996 --> 50:43.487
That's how you feel to me too, baby.

50:50.130 --> 50:52.257
Got room for one more?

50:58.639 --> 51:00.971
You guys are so beautiful.

51:02.685 --> 51:04.767
I'm a licensed massage therapist.

51:04.937 --> 51:06.802
Who wants to go first?

51:11.360 --> 51:14.022
Oh, you got a big knot right there.

51:51.483 --> 51:54.020
Tara. Oh, come on, Tara.

52:13.213 --> 52:15.169
Hey, Tara. Hey, come on.

52:15.341 --> 52:18.208
That girl in the tub was drunk.
I don't even know who she was.

52:18.385 --> 52:20.171
It looked like you wanted to know her.

52:20.554 --> 52:22.385
I just got carried away, that's all.

52:22.556 --> 52:25.218
Yeah, you and everybody else out there.

52:25.809 --> 52:27.390
Is this what Maryann's about?

52:27.978 --> 52:29.184
Are you in the lifestyle?

52:29.355 --> 52:31.596
Lifestyle?
That's just a bunch of drunk people...

52:31.774 --> 52:34.390
...trying to let loose.
That's got nothing to do with us.

52:34.568 --> 52:37.480
I don't give a crap what people
do with their own body parts...

52:37.655 --> 52:39.862
...but there's no "us"
if this is your scene.

52:42.868 --> 52:44.574
Goddamn it.

53:08.727 --> 53:10.433
Oh, hell.

53:10.604 --> 53:13.220
I wasn't gonna run off
without saying goodbye to you.

53:14.358 --> 53:16.690
I'm sure gonna miss you, buddy.

53:19.113 --> 53:20.728
All right. One last time.

53:20.906 --> 53:22.771
Let's go. Come on.

53:22.950 --> 53:25.441
Oh, you can't keep up with me.

53:26.203 --> 53:29.286
See, I knew it.
Underneath that tough vampire exterior...

53:29.456 --> 53:31.117
...you're nothing but a big softie.

53:31.291 --> 53:33.202
Don't tell anybody.

53:34.545 --> 53:37.787
That's a lot of pink, Bill.

53:38.215 --> 53:39.796
But I'm sure Jessica will love it.

53:39.967 --> 53:44.631
Yes, well, I remember when
ladies' clothing stores sold petticoats.

53:44.805 --> 53:46.261
That's just weird.

53:46.432 --> 53:48.764
Actually, I kind of miss them at times.

53:49.601 --> 53:51.432
They left something to the imagination.

53:52.396 --> 53:55.308
Unfastening them required a certain skill.

53:56.650 --> 53:59.312
I think there's
a Halloween store around here...

53:59.486 --> 54:01.477
...that might still have some.

54:02.823 --> 54:05.189
You are such a tease.

54:17.838 --> 54:20.454
I wasn't doing anything.
I wasn't gonna bite him.

54:20.632 --> 54:22.088
It's okay.

54:23.093 --> 54:24.708
Bill, don't.

54:33.312 --> 54:34.472
What's your problem?

54:34.855 --> 54:36.265
Come on in, the water's warm.

54:38.484 --> 54:41.476
Fine. Suit yourself.

54:49.203 --> 54:50.864
Were you just talking to that dog?

54:51.830 --> 54:53.161
Daphne.

54:53.332 --> 54:55.664
What are you doing here
in the middle of the night?

54:55.834 --> 54:58.291
Same as you, I guess.
Just trying to cool off.

54:59.296 --> 55:01.628
And I can't sleep.

55:01.799 --> 55:04.882
See, I have this hard-ass boss.

55:05.052 --> 55:08.135
He really laid into me this week.

55:08.639 --> 55:09.799
Sounds like a jerk.

55:11.058 --> 55:14.425
He's not all bad. He can be real nice.

55:14.603 --> 55:15.683
To dogs.

55:16.063 --> 55:19.681
Hey, listen, I'm sorry.
I've had a lot on my mind.

55:21.068 --> 55:24.811
I know how hard you're trying, and I think
you're starting to get the hang of it.

55:24.988 --> 55:26.239
I really do.

55:26.406 --> 55:29.489
You're even worse at lying
than you are at being a boss, Sam.

55:29.660 --> 55:31.901
But I'll take what I can get, so thanks.

55:32.079 --> 55:33.194
You're welcome.

55:33.372 --> 55:35.738
Is this water warm,
or are you lying about that too?

55:35.916 --> 55:38.248
Oh, no, it's great.

55:38.418 --> 55:43.082
Nothing like a midnight swim
to wash away your troubles.

55:43.257 --> 55:44.838
You should try it sometime.

55:45.008 --> 55:46.919
Yeah, I think | Will.

55:47.845 --> 55:49.631
-You mean now?
-|t's a big lake, Sam.

55:49.805 --> 55:52.842
I think there's room
for both of us, ain't there?

55:53.016 --> 55:54.517
Yeah.

55:54.685 --> 55:58.428
Yeah, yeah. I guess so. Come on in.
