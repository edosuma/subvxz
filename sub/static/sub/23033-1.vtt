WEBVTT

02:06.080 --> 02:07.195
We're not clear yet.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.829
There are still 30 pallets
of cannon shells in C bunker.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.755
Forget the munitions, there's no time.
Just get everyone on the transports.

02:13.840 --> 02:16.070
Oh, no.

02:28.080 --> 02:30.276
We've caught them in the middle
of their evacuation.

02:31.200 --> 02:34.636
I have my orders from
Supreme Leader Snoke himself.

02:34.840 --> 02:38.470
This is where we snuff out
the Resistance once and for all.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.680
Tell Captain Canady
to prime his dreadnought.

02:41.840 --> 02:47.358
Incinerate their base, destroy their
transports and obliterate their fleet.

03:02.320 --> 03:05.756
General, Resistance ship approaching.
Guns and shields in attack mode.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.189
A single light fighter.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.029
Happy beeps here, buddy, come on.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.270
We've pulled crazier stunts than this.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.477
Just for the record,
Commander Dameron,

03:24.680 --> 03:26.114
I'm with the droid on this one.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.157
Thank you for your support, General.

03:29.320 --> 03:30.469
Happy beeps.

03:31.640 --> 03:32.630
Attention.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.518
This is Commander Poe Dameron
of the Republic fleet,

03:34.680 --> 03:37.672
I have an urgent
communique' for General Hugs-

03:37.840 --> 03:39.194
Patch him through.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.034
This is General Hux
of the First Order.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.511
The Republic is no more.

03:44.680 --> 03:47.911
Your fleet are Rebel scum
and war criminals.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.555
Tell your precious princess
there will be no terms,

03:50.720 --> 03:53.234
there will be no surrender.

03:54.520 --> 03:56.431
Hi, I'm holding for General Hugs.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.558
This is Hux.
You and your friends are doomed.

03:59.760 --> 04:02.798
We will wipe your filth
from the galaxy.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.757
Okay. I'll hold.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.430
Hello?

04:07.800 --> 04:10.314
Hello? Yup. I'm still here.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.798
Can he hear me?

04:12.960 --> 04:14.189
- Hugs?
- He can.

04:14.360 --> 04:17.591
With an "H." Skinny guy.
Kinda pasty.

04:18.040 --> 04:21.077
I can hear you. Can you hear me?

04:21.279 --> 04:22.793
Look, I can't hold forever.
If you reach him,

04:23.240 --> 04:26.153
tell him Leia has
an urgent message for him...

04:26.320 --> 04:28.596
I believe he's tooling with you, sir.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.512
...about his mother.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.393
Open fire!

04:32.480 --> 04:34.039
BB-8, punch it!

04:43.920 --> 04:45.319
He's going for the dreadnought.

04:45.400 --> 04:46.390
Ha!

04:47.000 --> 04:48.115
He's insane.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.237
Woo-hoo! That's got a kick.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.397
All right, taking out the cannons now.

05:08.480 --> 05:09.550
Tallie, start your approach.

05:09.640 --> 05:10.675
Copy that.

05:12.280 --> 05:15.238
Captain Canady,
why aren't you blasting that puny ship?

05:15.640 --> 05:18.200
That puny ship is too small
and at too close range.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.714
We need to scramble our fighters

05:20.200 --> 05:21.918
five bloody minutes ago.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.275
He'll never penetrate our armor.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.238
He's not trying to penetrate our armor.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.397
He's clearing out our surface cannons.

05:29.760 --> 05:30.989
One cannon left.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.480
And here comes the parade.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.110
Yeah! Yeah, I see him!

05:44.040 --> 05:46.429
No, no, no. Damn it!

05:46.520 --> 05:47.840
BB-8, my weapons systems are down.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.149
We gotta take out that last cannon

05:49.320 --> 05:50.390
or our bombers are toast.

05:50.560 --> 05:51.880
Work your magic, buddy.

06:07.440 --> 06:08.953
Are the auto-cannons primed?

06:09.120 --> 06:10.110
Primed and ready, sir.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.475
What are we waiting for?

06:11.880 --> 06:12.915
Fire on the base!

06:17.520 --> 06:18.510
Punch it!

06:26.880 --> 06:28.996
The last transport is in the air.
The evacuation is complete.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.229
You did it, Poe.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.637
Now get your squad back here
so we can get out of this place.

06:34.720 --> 06:35.790
No, General...

06:35.880 --> 06:37.439
We can do this.
We have the chance

06:37.600 --> 06:38.670
to take out a dreadnought.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.313
These things are fleet killers.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.470
We can't let it get away.

06:45.560 --> 06:46.755
Disengage now...

06:46.920 --> 06:49.719
Commander. That is an or...

06:55.480 --> 06:58.632
Wipe that nervous expression
off your face, Threepio.

06:59.160 --> 07:01.834
Oh. Well, I will certainly try, General.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.149
Nervous?

07:05.960 --> 07:07.314
Let's go, BB-8.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.595
It's now or never!

07:32.280 --> 07:34.396
POE; Yes!

07:36.280 --> 07:38.032
All clear! Bring the bombs.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.110
Captain,

07:39.760 --> 07:41.558
Resistance bombers approaching.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.030
Of course they are.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.474
Bombers, keep that tight formation.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.677
Fighters, protect the bombers.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.319
It's not every day we
get a shot at a dreadnought,

08:01.400 --> 08:02.435
so let's make this count.

08:02.560 --> 08:03.595
Copy that, Blue Leader.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.637
You get us there,
we'll give it to them.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.438
- Copy. We're on it.
- Fighters incoming.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.393
Gunners, look alive.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.675
Snubfighters at two-ten!

08:14.760 --> 08:15.830
- They're coming in!
- Form up!

08:15.920 --> 08:17.319
They're everywhere!

08:17.720 --> 08:18.710
Here they come.

08:18.800 --> 08:19.790
Incoming fighters. Form up.

08:19.880 --> 08:21.234
Vector in at attack speed.

08:21.320 --> 08:23.038
- Pull up!
- Flank right.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.874
Mayday! Mayday!
Mayday! We're going down!

08:27.360 --> 08:29.431
Recharge the auto-cannons.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.598
Target their cruiser.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.311
I see it. Tallie,
they've targeted the fleet

08:39.480 --> 08:41.118
and begun the priming sequence.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.315
Copy that.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.470
We're almost there.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.952
Bombardiers, begin your drop sequence.

08:54.320 --> 08:55.993
I've got a visual on the target.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.595
We're approaching the sweet spot.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.194
Bombs are armed.

09:25.560 --> 09:28.154
- Auto-cannons aimed.
- Forty seconds to full charge.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.675
Destroy that last bomber!

09:35.800 --> 09:38.474
Paige, come in. We're over the target.

09:38.680 --> 09:39.795
Why aren't your bay doors open?

09:39.960 --> 09:42.236
You're the only bomber left.
It's all down to you!

09:51.560 --> 09:52.959
- Nix!
- Paige!

09:53.120 --> 09:54.952
Drop the payload now!

10:04.240 --> 10:05.310
Look out!

10:07.120 --> 10:08.349
No!

11:10.200 --> 11:11.349
Bombs away!

11:38.880 --> 11:40.996
Direct hit! Dreadnought down!

12:15.600 --> 12:16.954
General, Supreme Leader Snoke

12:17.120 --> 12:19.236
is making contact from his ship.

12:20.800 --> 12:21.790
Excellent.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.560
I'll take it in my chambers.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.755
General Hux.

12:28.840 --> 12:31.832
Ah, good. Supreme Lea...

12:35.680 --> 12:36.909
My disappointment

12:37.000 --> 12:41.517
in your performance cannot be overstated.

12:41.680 --> 12:43.830
They can't get away, Supreme Leader.

12:44.920 --> 12:48.197
We have them tied on the end of a string.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.355
Rey!

13:17.000 --> 13:18.399
Well done, pal.

13:22.120 --> 13:25.192
"Finn naked leaking bag"?
What? Did you fry a chip?

13:32.560 --> 13:34.278
Finn! Finn, buddy.

13:35.160 --> 13:36.514
It's so good to see you.

13:36.680 --> 13:37.715
What? Let's...

13:37.920 --> 13:40.958
We need to get you dressed.
Come on.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.349
You must have a thousand questions.

13:42.520 --> 13:43.794
Where's Rey?

14:46.760 --> 14:48.398
Master Skywalker?

15:12.360 --> 15:14.271
Master Skywalker?

15:15.920 --> 15:17.558
I'm from the Resistance.

15:17.720 --> 15:20.599
Your sister Leia sent me.
We need your help.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.033
Hello?

16:02.360 --> 16:03.839
Go away.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.119
Chewie, what are you doing here?

16:12.880 --> 16:14.234
He said you're coming back with us.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.390
How did you find me?

16:15.560 --> 16:17.233
Long story. We'll tell you on the Falcon.

16:18.440 --> 16:19.794
Falcon?

16:22.400 --> 16:23.799
Wait.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.031
Where's Han?

16:34.120 --> 16:37.954
Tied on a string indeed,
General Hux. Well done.

16:38.120 --> 16:41.317
The Resistance will soon
be in our grasp.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.716
Thank you, Supreme Leader.

16:51.320 --> 16:54.119
You wonder why I keep a rabid cur

16:54.320 --> 16:57.631
in such a place of power?

16:57.800 --> 17:01.555
A cur's weakness,
properly manipulated,

17:01.720 --> 17:05.429
can be a sharp tool.

17:07.599 --> 17:09.272
How's your wound?

17:10.480 --> 17:11.628
It's nothing.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.390
Hmm.

17:15.160 --> 17:18.710
The mighty Kylo Ren.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.278
When I found you,

17:22.079 --> 17:26.039
I saw what all masters live to see.

17:26.200 --> 17:30.080
Raw, untamed power.

17:30.240 --> 17:35.679
And beyond that, something truly special.

17:36.440 --> 17:38.954
The potential of your bloodline.

17:39.960 --> 17:44.318
A new Vader.

17:50.040 --> 17:52.554
Now I fear

17:54.240 --> 17:56.880
I was mistaken.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.634
I've given everything I have to you.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.000
To the dark side.

18:04.160 --> 18:07.073
Take that ridiculous thing off.

18:16.280 --> 18:20.035
Yes, there it is.

18:21.440 --> 18:24.876
You have too much
of your father's heart in you,

18:24.960 --> 18:25.995
young Solo.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.793
I killed Han Solo.

18:29.080 --> 18:30.878
When the moment came,
I didn't hesitate.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.599
And look at you,

18:32.680 --> 18:35.991
the deed split your spirit to the bone.

18:36.160 --> 18:38.629
You were unbalanced,

18:38.840 --> 18:42.515
bested by a girl
who had never held a lightsaber!

18:42.720 --> 18:43.949
You failed!

18:47.160 --> 18:48.559
Skywalker lives.

18:49.840 --> 18:54.471
The seed of the Jedi Order lives.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.517
And as long as it does,

18:56.680 --> 18:59.991
hope lives in the galaxy.

19:00.200 --> 19:05.434
I thought you would be the one
to snuff it out.

19:06.640 --> 19:09.678
Alas, you're no Vader.

19:10.840 --> 19:13.354
You're just a child

19:15.280 --> 19:17.476
in a mask.

19:50.280 --> 19:51.315
Prepare my ship.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.032
There's no light
left in Kylo Ren.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.593
He's only getting stronger.

20:01.800 --> 20:05.509
The First Order will control
all the major systems within weeks.

20:05.720 --> 20:07.677
We need your help.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.434
We need the Jedi Order back.

20:12.840 --> 20:15.195
We need Luke Skywalker.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.753
You don't need Luke Skywalker.

20:22.600 --> 20:23.920
Did you hear a word I just said?

20:24.000 --> 20:24.990
You think what?

20:25.200 --> 20:29.797
I'm gonna walk out with a laser sword
and face down the whole First Order?

20:30.840 --> 20:33.639
What did you think
was going to happen here?

20:33.720 --> 20:34.755
You think that I came

20:34.840 --> 20:39.038
to the most unfindable place
in the galaxy for no reason at all?

20:39.520 --> 20:40.954
Go away.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.318
I'm not leaving without you!

21:51.280 --> 21:52.395
Careful!

22:28.520 --> 22:29.954
You're wasting your time.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.472
Who are you?

23:53.240 --> 23:55.436
I know this place.

24:01.160 --> 24:03.834
Built a thousand generations ago

24:04.600 --> 24:06.910
to keep these.

24:07.640 --> 24:10.280
The original Jedi texts.

24:12.600 --> 24:17.310
Just like me,
they're the last of the Jedi religion.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.234
You've seen this place.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.277
You've seen this island.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.871
Only in dreams.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.877
Who are you?

24:30.280 --> 24:31.270
The Resistance sent me.

24:31.440 --> 24:32.635
They sent you?

24:33.040 --> 24:35.031
What's special about you?

24:36.880 --> 24:38.837
- Where are you from?
- Nowhere.

24:39.360 --> 24:41.795
- No one's from nowhere.
- Jakku.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.753
All right,
that is pretty much nowhere.

24:44.960 --> 24:47.554
Why are you here, Rey,
from nowhere?

24:47.720 --> 24:48.755
The Resistance sent me.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.035
We need your help.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.190
The First Order's become unstoppable.

24:52.360 --> 24:55.000
Why are you here?

25:07.600 --> 25:10.991
Something inside me has always been there.

25:13.480 --> 25:15.312
But now it's awake.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.759
And I'm afraid.

25:19.960 --> 25:21.030
I don't know what it is

25:21.720 --> 25:23.552
or what to do with it.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.119
And I need help.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.991
You need a teacher.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.229
I can't teach you.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.075
Why not?

25:33.440 --> 25:35.397
I've seen your daily routine.
You're not busy.

25:35.560 --> 25:39.315
I will never train
another generation of Jedi.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.956
I came to this island to die.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.672
It's time for the Jedi to end.

25:47.520 --> 25:48.715
Why?

25:49.920 --> 25:52.389
Leia sent me here with hope.

25:52.560 --> 25:55.393
If she was wrong,
she deserves to know why.

25:56.480 --> 25:57.754
We all do.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.437
- You're demoted.
- What? Wait!

26:29.600 --> 26:31.830
- We took down a dreadnought.
- At what cost?

26:32.000 --> 26:33.718
You start an attack,
you follow it through.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.473
Poe, get your head out of your cockpit.

26:35.640 --> 26:38.678
There are things that you cannot solve

26:38.840 --> 26:41.753
by jumping in an X-wing
and blowing something up!

26:41.920 --> 26:43.877
I need you to learn that.

26:44.960 --> 26:46.758
There were heroes on that mission.

26:46.920 --> 26:48.399
Dead heroes.

26:49.160 --> 26:50.559
No leaders.

26:55.960 --> 26:57.951
We're really nowhere.

26:58.120 --> 26:59.952
How's Rey gonna find us now?

27:02.480 --> 27:03.879
A cloaked binary beacon.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.553
To light her way home.

27:07.080 --> 27:09.117
All right, so until she gets back,
what's the plan?

27:09.280 --> 27:11.078
We need to find a new base.

27:11.240 --> 27:12.275
One with enough power

27:12.400 --> 27:16.109
to get a distress signal
to our allies scattered in the Outer Rim.

27:18.040 --> 27:19.792
Proximity alert!

27:20.080 --> 27:21.070
They found us.

27:21.280 --> 27:22.679
That's impossible.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.032
That's Snake's ship.

27:37.200 --> 27:38.599
You gotta be kidding me.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.439
- Can we jump to lightspeed?
- We have enough

27:40.520 --> 27:41.840
fuel resources for just one jump.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.195
Well, then, do it.
We gotta get out of here.

27:43.360 --> 27:44.680
Wait.

27:45.800 --> 27:48.360
They've tracked us through lightspeed.

27:49.640 --> 27:50.630
That's impossible.

27:51.160 --> 27:52.150
Yes.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.633
And they've done it.

27:56.800 --> 27:57.835
So if we jump through lightspeed,

27:57.920 --> 27:59.752
they'll just find us again
and we'll be out of fuel.

27:59.840 --> 28:00.830
They've got us.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.752
Not yet, they don't.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.196
Permission to jump in an X-wing
and blow something up?

28:05.280 --> 28:06.679
Permission granted.

28:06.840 --> 28:08.319
Admiral, swing us around!

28:08.480 --> 28:10.596
Full astern. Rotate shields!

28:10.760 --> 28:13.798
To your stations! Move, move, move!

28:27.680 --> 28:28.670
Follow my lead.

28:33.600 --> 28:36.114
Green Squadron to launch position.

28:36.280 --> 28:38.396
Clear all launch traffic.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.071
Don't wait for me!
Jump in and fire her up!

28:44.280 --> 28:48.194
Technicians,
lock down supplies for launch conditions.

29:19.040 --> 29:20.872
Move! Move!

29:37.640 --> 29:39.039
Poe, are you all right?

29:39.200 --> 29:41.396
We need to get out of range
of those Star Destroyers.

29:41.560 --> 29:42.959
We need to what?

29:43.120 --> 29:44.474
Full engines ahead.

29:44.640 --> 29:48.315
Get out of range of the Star Destroyers
and the fighters will fall back.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.153
All craft, full engines!

29:50.320 --> 29:52.357
Concentrate rear shields.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.877
Ren, the Resistance
have pulled out of range.

30:53.080 --> 30:54.593
We can't cover you at this distance.

30:54.760 --> 30:57.115
Return to the fleet.

30:58.960 --> 31:01.349
What is the point of all this

31:01.520 --> 31:04.911
if we can't blow up three tiny cruisers?

31:05.080 --> 31:07.071
Well, they're faster and lighter, sir.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.038
They can't lose us,
but they can keep at a range

31:09.200 --> 31:11.396
where our cannons are ineffective
against their shields.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.679
Well, keep up the barrage.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.309
Let's at least remind them
that we're still here.

31:17.520 --> 31:18.590
Very good, sir.

31:18.760 --> 31:22.151
They won't last long
burning fuel like this.

31:22.320 --> 31:24.516
It's just a matter of time.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.917
Move! Out of the way, everybody!
Give room!

32:34.040 --> 32:36.350
Life signs are weak,
but she's fighting.

34:08.679 --> 34:09.670
Artoo?

34:10.520 --> 34:12.193
Artoo!

34:14.000 --> 34:15.434
Yes.

34:15.560 --> 34:16.958
Yeah, I know.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.471
Hey, sacred island, watch the language.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.996
Old friend.

34:26.719 --> 34:28.677
I wish I could make you understand.

34:29.719 --> 34:31.710
But I'm not coming back.

34:32.440 --> 34:35.795
Nothing can make me
change my mind.

34:40.080 --> 34:42.594
Years ago, you served my father
in the Clone Wars.

34:42.960 --> 34:45.520
Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.

34:45.679 --> 34:47.876
I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request to you in person...

34:47.960 --> 34:49.234
That was a cheap move.

34:49.639 --> 34:51.039
...but my ship
has fallen under attack,

34:51.199 --> 34:53.668
and I'm afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.757
This is our most desperate hour.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.433
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

34:58.560 --> 34:59.755
You're my only hope.

35:11.160 --> 35:13.834
Tomorrow at dawn.

35:14.560 --> 35:15.880
Three lessons.

35:16.040 --> 35:18.634
I will teach you the ways of the Jedi

35:19.320 --> 35:21.072
and why they need to end.

35:31.240 --> 35:32.560
General Organa,

35:33.560 --> 35:34.709
Leia,

35:34.880 --> 35:37.554
is unconscious but recovering.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.997
That's the only good news I have.

35:41.640 --> 35:45.918
Admiral Ackbar,
all our leadership, they're gone.

35:47.160 --> 35:48.992
Leia was the sole survivor
on the bridge.

35:49.240 --> 35:50.435
Oh, dear. Oh, dear!

35:50.600 --> 35:54.719
If she were here, she'd say
save your sorrow for after the fight.

35:55.920 --> 35:56.990
To that end,

35:58.040 --> 36:01.795
the chain of command is clear
as to who should take her place.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.558
Vice Admiral Holdo

36:05.000 --> 36:06.752
of the cruiser Ninka.

36:07.840 --> 36:09.274
Thank you, Commander.

36:15.600 --> 36:16.795
Four hundred of us

36:16.960 --> 36:18.473
on three ships.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.594
We're the very last
of the Resistance.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.830
But we're not alone.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.196
In every corner of the galaxy,

36:29.360 --> 36:32.159
the downtrodden and oppressed
know our symbol,

36:32.440 --> 36:34.192
and they put their hope in it.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.553
We are the spark

36:36.640 --> 36:40.190
that will light the fire that
will restore the Republic.

36:41.240 --> 36:45.711
That spark,
this Resistance, must survive.

36:46.720 --> 36:48.870
That is our mission.

36:50.360 --> 36:51.634
Now, to your stations.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.436
And may the Force be with us.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.274
That's Admiral Holdo?

37:04.280 --> 37:06.317
Battle of Chyron Belt Admiral Holdo?

37:09.680 --> 37:10.954
Not what I expected.

37:12.280 --> 37:14.635
Vice Admiral?
Commander Dameron.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.633
With our current fuel consumption,
there's a very limited amount of time

37:17.800 --> 37:19.518
that we can stay out of range
of those Star Destroyers.

37:19.680 --> 37:22.035
Very kind of you
to make me aware.

37:22.440 --> 37:23.430
Let's get me those fuel projections.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.830
And we need to shake 'em
before we can find a new base, so,

37:26.000 --> 37:27.354
what's our plan?

37:27.520 --> 37:29.318
Our plan, captain?

37:30.200 --> 37:31.873
Not commander, right?

37:32.040 --> 37:34.190
Wasn't it Leia's last official act
to demote you

37:34.360 --> 37:35.714
for your dreadnought plan

37:36.440 --> 37:38.716
where we lost our entire bombing fleet?

37:42.160 --> 37:43.480
"Captain." "Commander."

37:43.560 --> 37:44.675
You can call me whatever you like.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.678
I just wanna know what's going on.

37:47.360 --> 37:48.509
Of course you do.

37:49.000 --> 37:49.990
I understand.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.513
I've dealt with plenty
of trigger-happy flyboys like you.

37:54.040 --> 37:55.030
You're impulsive.

37:56.920 --> 37:58.035
Dangerous.

37:59.400 --> 38:00.993
And the last thing
we need right now.

38:02.040 --> 38:05.954
So stick to your post
and follow my orders.

38:19.040 --> 38:20.872
Turbo/ink banks seven and eight

38:20.960 --> 38:22.837
are offline due to maintenance.

38:56.600 --> 38:57.874
What are you doing here?

38:58.040 --> 38:59.439
Hey. Hi.

38:59.920 --> 39:02.434
Uh, I was...
You know, I was just...

39:02.600 --> 39:03.829
You're Finn!

39:04.800 --> 39:05.995
The Finn!

39:06.480 --> 39:08.232
- The Finn?
- Sorry.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.159
I work behind pipes all day.

39:10.600 --> 39:14.116
Doing talking with Resistance heroes
is not my forte.

39:15.280 --> 39:16.475
Doing...

39:16.640 --> 39:17.755
Doing talking.

39:18.960 --> 39:20.439
I'm Rose.

39:20.800 --> 39:21.915
Breathe.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.116
- Okay.
- Yeah.

39:24.280 --> 39:27.750
Look, I'm not a Resistance hero,
but it was nice talking to you, Rose.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.753
May the Force be with you.

39:33.760 --> 39:36.036
Wow. You, too.

39:37.520 --> 39:40.433
Okay. But you are a hero.

39:41.120 --> 39:44.078
You left the First Order,
what you did on the Starkiller Base...

39:44.240 --> 39:45.719
When we heard about it,
my sister Paige said,

39:45.880 --> 39:47.439
"Rose, that's a real hero."

39:48.080 --> 39:49.150
"Know right from wrong

39:49.280 --> 39:50.839
"and don't run away
when it gets hard," she said.

39:51.280 --> 39:52.270
You know...

39:52.400 --> 39:54.118
Just this morning, I've had to stun

39:54.200 --> 39:56.476
three people trying to
jump ship in this escape pod.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.711
- What?
- They were running away.

39:59.080 --> 40:00.229
That's disgraceful.

40:01.200 --> 40:02.315
I know.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.310
Anyway, uh...

40:06.480 --> 40:08.153
Gotta get back to
what I was doing, so...

40:08.320 --> 40:09.640
What were you doing?

40:10.240 --> 40:11.435
Uh, just...

40:11.520 --> 40:13.352
- Doing some checks.
- Checking the escape pods.

40:13.520 --> 40:15.875
- No, it's routine checks.
- By boarding one

40:17.640 --> 40:19.039
with a packed bag.

40:19.760 --> 40:20.750
Okay.

40:20.920 --> 40:21.910
Listen, I'm...

40:35.720 --> 40:37.631
I can't move. I can't move.

40:37.800 --> 40:39.677
- I know.
- What happened?

40:39.840 --> 40:41.638
I'm taking you to the brig
and turning you in for desertion.

40:41.800 --> 40:42.949
I was not deserting.

40:43.120 --> 40:45.350
- I told you that...
- My sister just died

40:45.520 --> 40:47.113
protecting the fleet.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.191
And you were running away.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.355
I'm sorry.

40:51.760 --> 40:52.750
But this fleet is doomed,

40:52.840 --> 40:55.070
and if my friend comes back to it,
she's doomed, too.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.515
I've gotta get this...

40:58.000 --> 40:59.877
I gotta get this beacon
far away from here.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.394
Then she'll find me and be safe.

41:02.240 --> 41:04.117
You're a selfish traitor.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.278
Look, we can't outrun
the First Order fleet.

41:06.480 --> 41:07.754
We can jump to lightspeed!

41:07.920 --> 41:08.910
Well, they can track us
through lightspeed.

41:09.560 --> 41:10.550
They can track us through lightspeed?

41:10.640 --> 41:11.630
Yeah.

41:11.720 --> 41:12.710
They'd just show up
thirty seconds later

41:12.800 --> 41:13.790
and we'd have
blown a ton of fuel,

41:13.880 --> 41:15.996
which, by the way,
we're dangerously short on.

41:16.680 --> 41:18.398
They can track us through lightspeed.

41:18.720 --> 41:19.710
Yes. And they could...

41:20.240 --> 41:21.230
I can't feel my teeth.

41:21.800 --> 41:23.199
What did you shoot me with?

41:23.360 --> 41:24.350
Active tracking.

41:24.520 --> 41:25.555
What now?

41:26.200 --> 41:27.270
Hyperspace tracking is new tech

41:27.440 --> 41:29.954
but the principle must be
the same as any active tracker.

41:30.120 --> 41:31.679
- They're only tracking us...
- Only tracking us...

41:31.880 --> 41:33.154
...from the lead ship.

41:33.320 --> 41:34.719
But we can't get to the tracker.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.916
It's an A-class process,
they'll control it from the main bridge.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.320
Well, I mean, yes,
but every A-class process...

41:38.480 --> 41:40.869
...has a dedicated power breaker.

41:41.400 --> 41:43.869
But... Wait, but who knows
where the breaker room

41:43.960 --> 41:44.950
is on a Star Destroyer?

41:47.240 --> 41:49.117
I'm the guy that used to mop it.

41:49.600 --> 41:50.829
If I can get us there,

41:51.320 --> 41:53.152
I can shut their tracker down.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.637
Just give it to me
one more time, simpler.

41:55.800 --> 41:59.111
So, the First Order's only tracking us
from one Destroyer, the lead one.

41:59.280 --> 42:00.350
So we blow that one up?

42:00.520 --> 42:01.715
I like where your head's at, but no.

42:01.880 --> 42:03.598
They'd only start tracking us
from another Destroyer.

42:03.720 --> 42:04.710
But if we can...

42:04.800 --> 42:06.996
If we sneak on board the lead Destroyer
and disable the tracker

42:07.080 --> 42:08.275
without them realizing, then we can...

42:08.440 --> 42:10.511
They won't realize it's off
for one system cycle.

42:10.680 --> 42:13.069
- About six minutes.
- Sneak on board.

42:15.400 --> 42:16.913
Disable the tracker.

42:18.320 --> 42:20.516
Our fleet escapes before they realize.

42:22.920 --> 42:23.910
Hmm.

42:28.920 --> 42:29.910
How'd you two meet?

42:32.880 --> 42:33.870
Just luck.

42:35.640 --> 42:36.710
Yeah?

42:37.000 --> 42:38.229
Good luck?

42:38.680 --> 42:39.829
Not sure yet.

42:40.320 --> 42:41.674
Poe, we gotta do this.

42:41.840 --> 42:44.036
It'll save the fleet and it'll save Rey.

42:45.800 --> 42:48.360
If I must be
the sole voice of reason,

42:48.520 --> 42:50.511
Admiral Holdo will never
agree to this plan.

42:51.880 --> 42:54.315
Yeah, you're right, Threepio.

42:54.480 --> 42:57.040
It's a "need-to-know" plan,
and she doesn't.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.838
- That wasn't exactly my...
- All right,

42:59.000 --> 43:00.354
you guys shut down that tracker.

43:00.520 --> 43:01.999
I'll be here to jump us to lightspeed.

43:02.160 --> 43:03.150
The question is,

43:03.320 --> 43:05.357
how do we sneak the two of you
onto Snoke's Destroyer?

43:05.560 --> 43:06.550
We steal clearance codes.

43:06.720 --> 43:08.631
No, they're bio-hexacrypt
and rescrambled every hour.

43:10.560 --> 43:13.120
We can't get through their
security shields undetected.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.029
Nobody can.

43:18.880 --> 43:20.393
Could I do it?

43:20.560 --> 43:22.790
Of course I could do it.
But I can't do it.

43:23.160 --> 43:24.833
I'm a little tied down right now.

43:24.920 --> 43:26.194
Oh!

43:26.280 --> 43:28.191
Maz? What is happening?

43:28.280 --> 43:31.636
Union dispute. You do not want
to hear about it.

43:31.720 --> 43:33.472
But, lucky for you,

43:33.640 --> 43:37.395
there's exactly one guy I trust
who can crack that kind of security!

43:39.880 --> 43:41.518
He's a master codebreaker,

43:41.720 --> 43:44.712
an ace pilot,
a poet with a blaster.

43:47.320 --> 43:48.310
Oh, my.

43:48.520 --> 43:50.750
It sounds like this codebreaker fellow
can do everything.

43:50.920 --> 43:53.389
Oh, yes, he can.

43:54.800 --> 43:58.759
You'll find him with a red
plom bloom on his lapel

43:58.920 --> 44:01.514
rolling at a high stakes table

44:01.880 --> 44:03.871
in the casino on Canto Bight.

44:04.040 --> 44:07.032
Canto Bight? No, no. That's... Maz...

44:07.200 --> 44:09.032
ls there any way that we can
take care of this ourselves?

44:09.200 --> 44:11.874
Sony, kiddo.
This is rarefied cracking.

44:12.400 --> 44:13.754
You wanna get on that Destroyer,

44:13.880 --> 44:15.393
I only know one option.

44:15.920 --> 44:18.434
Find the Master Codebreaker.

45:46.760 --> 45:49.149
You'll bring Luke Skywalker to me.

45:55.360 --> 45:57.636
You're not doing this.
The effort would kill you.

46:02.640 --> 46:03.710
Can you see my surroundings?

46:03.880 --> 46:05.393
You're gonna pay for what you did!

46:05.560 --> 46:06.834
I can't see yours.

46:08.520 --> 46:09.715
Just you.

46:11.960 --> 46:13.359
So, no.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.355
This is something else.

46:23.320 --> 46:24.310
Luke.

46:24.680 --> 46:26.432
What's that about?

46:41.040 --> 46:43.429
I was cleaning my blaster.
It went off.

46:46.480 --> 46:47.629
Let's get started.

46:51.800 --> 46:53.279
Who were those things?

46:54.080 --> 46:55.400
Caretakers.

46:55.560 --> 46:56.675
Island natives.

46:56.840 --> 46:59.229
They've kept up the Jedi structures
since they were built.

46:59.960 --> 47:01.519
I don't think they like me.

47:01.680 --> 47:03.353
Can't imagine why.

47:39.320 --> 47:40.640
Master Skywalker,

47:41.160 --> 47:42.309
we need you to bring the Jedi back

47:42.480 --> 47:45.279
because Kylo Ren is strong
with the dark side of the Force.

47:45.440 --> 47:47.909
Without the Jedi, we won't
stand a chance against him.

47:48.080 --> 47:50.390
What do you know
about the Force?

47:50.920 --> 47:53.753
It's a power that Jedi have
that lets them control people

47:54.480 --> 47:55.914
and make things float.

47:56.000 --> 47:56.990
Impressive.

47:57.160 --> 47:59.117
Every word in that sentence was wrong.

47:59.640 --> 48:02.871
Lesson one, sit here, legs crossed.

48:09.720 --> 48:12.792
The Force is not a power you have.

48:12.960 --> 48:15.270
It's not about lifting rocks.

48:15.640 --> 48:17.472
It's the energy between all things,

48:17.640 --> 48:19.711
a tension, a balance,

48:19.880 --> 48:22.156
that binds the universe together.

48:22.320 --> 48:23.310
Okay.

48:24.480 --> 48:25.629
But what is it?

48:27.120 --> 48:28.315
Close your eyes.

48:30.240 --> 48:31.594
Breathe.

48:32.320 --> 48:33.310
Now,

48:34.760 --> 48:35.909
reach out.

48:42.680 --> 48:43.715
I feel something.

48:43.840 --> 48:44.830
- You feel it?
- Yes, I feel it.

48:44.920 --> 48:45.910
- That's the Force.
- Really?

48:46.080 --> 48:47.559
Wow, it must be
really strong with you.

48:47.720 --> 48:48.710
I've never felt any...

48:48.880 --> 48:49.870
Ow!

48:52.720 --> 48:53.949
You meant reach out like...

48:56.600 --> 48:57.590
I'll try again.

49:00.120 --> 49:01.110
Breathe.

49:03.360 --> 49:05.237
Just breathe.

49:08.400 --> 49:10.630
Reach out with your feelings.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.195
What do you see?

49:21.280 --> 49:22.270
The island.

49:24.200 --> 49:25.235
Life.

49:26.600 --> 49:27.920
Death and decay,

49:29.480 --> 49:30.914
that feeds new life.

49:32.600 --> 49:33.635
Warmth.

49:34.760 --> 49:35.750
Cold.

49:38.040 --> 49:39.439
Peace.

49:41.040 --> 49:42.314
Violence.

49:43.360 --> 49:44.839
And between it all?

49:45.640 --> 49:46.630
Balance.

49:47.400 --> 49:48.629
An energy.

49:51.840 --> 49:53.274
A Force.

49:54.920 --> 49:56.513
And inside you?

49:57.680 --> 49:59.273
Inside me

50:00.440 --> 50:02.511
that same Force.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.799
And this is the lesson.

50:06.960 --> 50:10.078
That Force does not
belong to the Jedi.

50:11.360 --> 50:14.113
To say that if the Jedi die,
the light dies, is vanity.

50:14.320 --> 50:16.436
Can you feel that?

50:18.200 --> 50:19.838
There's something else

50:21.880 --> 50:23.314
beneath the island.

50:24.240 --> 50:25.230
A place.

50:26.600 --> 50:27.749
A dark place.

50:29.880 --> 50:30.995
Balance.

50:31.760 --> 50:33.592
Powerful light, powerful darkness.

50:33.960 --> 50:35.075
It's cold.

50:40.840 --> 50:41.910
It's calling me.

50:43.240 --> 50:44.275
Resist it, Rey.

50:45.400 --> 50:46.595
Rey?

50:49.200 --> 50:50.190
Rey!

50:59.040 --> 51:00.838
You went straight to the dark.

51:02.200 --> 51:03.759
That place was trying
to show me something.

51:03.920 --> 51:05.752
It offered something you needed.

51:06.360 --> 51:08.670
And you didn't even try
to stop yourself.

51:09.840 --> 51:11.433
But I didn't see you.

51:13.400 --> 51:15.073
Nothing from you.

51:18.520 --> 51:20.830
You've closed yourself off
from the Force.

51:24.400 --> 51:25.754
Of course you have.

51:27.120 --> 51:30.192
I've seen this raw strength
only once before,

51:30.720 --> 51:32.472
in Ben Solo.

51:32.640 --> 51:34.358
It didn't scare me enough then.

51:35.560 --> 51:37.073
It does now.

51:49.480 --> 51:50.470
What was that?

51:50.640 --> 51:51.835
Nothing, admiral.

51:52.040 --> 51:53.394
Passing debris.

52:00.720 --> 52:02.552
The fleet's only got
18 hours of fuel left.

52:02.960 --> 52:04.280
We gotta hurry.

52:05.600 --> 52:07.557
Still can't reach the Resistance?

52:07.640 --> 52:09.313
Keep at it.

52:09.520 --> 52:11.158
If you get through, check their status.

52:11.320 --> 52:12.640
And ask about Finn.

52:47.840 --> 52:49.797
Why is the Force connecting us?

52:50.160 --> 52:51.150
You and I.

52:51.320 --> 52:52.719
Murderous snake.

52:53.480 --> 52:56.518
You're too late.
You lost. I found Skywalker.

52:57.800 --> 52:58.995
Did he tell you what happened?

53:00.400 --> 53:02.550
The night I destroyed his temple,
did he tell you why?

53:02.720 --> 53:05.314
I know everything
I need to know about you.

53:05.480 --> 53:06.993
You do?

53:09.560 --> 53:11.471
Ah, you do.

53:12.760 --> 53:14.671
You have that look in your eyes.

53:14.840 --> 53:16.638
From the forest.

53:19.320 --> 53:20.549
When you called me a monster.

53:20.720 --> 53:22.836
You are a monster.

53:28.080 --> 53:29.434
Yes, I am.

53:53.760 --> 53:54.750
Okay.

53:54.960 --> 53:57.190
We get in, we find this codebreaker,
we get out.

53:57.360 --> 53:59.556
You know this town? Canto Bight?

53:59.720 --> 54:00.915
From stories.

54:01.080 --> 54:04.516
It's a terrible place filled with
the worst people in the galaxy.

54:04.640 --> 54:05.630
Great.

54:26.880 --> 54:28.518
I told those two, I said,

54:28.680 --> 54:31.354
"This is a public beach.
You can't park that shuttle here."

54:31.520 --> 54:34.114
But they just lit off toward the casino.

54:41.240 --> 54:42.674
Place your bets. Place your bets.

54:42.880 --> 54:44.632
All bets on the table
right now, right now!

54:44.760 --> 54:45.795
Place your bets here.

54:59.440 --> 55:02.558
Aw, yes!
This place is great!

55:03.200 --> 55:04.520
Okay.

55:06.840 --> 55:10.390
Maz said this Master Codebreaker
would have a red plom bloom on his lapel.

55:10.560 --> 55:12.312
Let's find him and get out of here.

55:12.480 --> 55:14.517
Well played. The house wins.

55:15.800 --> 55:16.790
Where are
your manners, more like?

55:16.880 --> 55:17.950
Come on!

55:41.720 --> 55:42.710
We've covered this whole casino.

55:42.800 --> 55:43.790
Zero red plom blooms.

55:43.880 --> 55:45.109
Where is this guy?

55:50.280 --> 55:51.953
Were those what I think they were?

55:59.160 --> 56:01.151
- What are those things?
- Fathiers.

56:02.080 --> 56:03.593
I've never seen a real one.

56:04.280 --> 56:06.920
Look, this whole place is beautiful.
I mean, come on.

56:07.680 --> 56:09.318
Why do you hate it so much?

56:10.280 --> 56:11.554
Look closer.

56:16.760 --> 56:19.593
My sister and I grew up
in a poor mining system.

56:21.240 --> 56:24.517
The First Order stripped our ore
to finance their military

56:25.920 --> 56:28.036
then shelled us
to test their weapons.

56:34.080 --> 56:36.151
They took everything we had.

56:37.480 --> 56:40.040
And who do you think
these people are?

56:40.520 --> 56:43.956
There's only one business in the galaxy
that'll get you this rich.

56:44.640 --> 56:45.755
War.

56:46.240 --> 56:48.595
Selling weapons to the First Order.

56:50.600 --> 56:55.356
I wish I could put my fist through this
whole lousy, beautiful town.

57:02.800 --> 57:03.835
Red plom bloom!

57:12.080 --> 57:13.115
Red plom bloom!

57:13.320 --> 57:14.469
The Master Codebreaker!

57:20.840 --> 57:22.399
Yep, those are the shuttle Parkers.

57:23.600 --> 57:24.590
All right.

57:24.720 --> 57:29.157
You two are under arrest
for parking violation 27B/6.

57:29.320 --> 57:30.310
You have the right to remain...

57:30.400 --> 57:32.516
- What was that?
- No, no, no. Not now, Lovey.

57:32.600 --> 57:33.635
I'm on a roll.

59:17.680 --> 59:19.034
Lesson two.

59:19.240 --> 59:23.393
Now that they're extinct,
the Jedi are romanticized, deified.

59:23.880 --> 59:26.633
But if you strip away the myth
and look at their deeds,

59:27.120 --> 59:29.157
the legacy of the Jedi is failure.

59:29.480 --> 59:30.629
Hypocrisy, hubris.

59:30.760 --> 59:31.750
That's not true.

59:31.960 --> 59:34.474
At the height of their powers,
they allowed Darth Sidious to rise

59:34.640 --> 59:36.517
create the Empire, and wipe them out.

59:36.920 --> 59:38.831
It was a Jedi Master
who was responsible

59:39.000 --> 59:42.118
for the training
and creation of Darth Vader.

59:42.280 --> 59:43.793
And a Jedi who saved him.

59:44.480 --> 59:46.039
Yes, the most hated man in the galaxy.

59:46.200 --> 59:48.396
But you saw there was conflict inside him.

59:48.600 --> 59:51.194
You believed that he wasn't gone.
That he could be turned.

59:51.560 --> 59:53.233
And I became a legend.

59:54.600 --> 59:56.750
For many years, there was balance

59:56.920 --> 59:58.319
and then I saw

59:58.600 --> 59:59.590
Ben.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:04.715
My nephew
with that mighty Skywalker blood.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.234
And in my hubris,

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.552
I thought I could train him,
I could pass on my strengths.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.071
Han was Han about it, but...

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.153
Leia

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.955
trusted me with her son.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:23.750
I took him,

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.552
and a dozen students,

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.113
and began a training temple.

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.271
By the time I realized

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.597
I was no match for
the darkness rising in him,

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.759
it was too late.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.434
What happened?

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.359
I went to confront him.

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.313
And he turned on me.

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.199
Ben, no!

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.436
He must have thought I was dead.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.349
When I came to,

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.113
the temple was burning-

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.234
He had vanished
with a handful of my students.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.516
And slaughtered the rest.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.951
Leia blamed Snoke,

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:16.869
but it was me.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.999
I failed.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:25.558
Because I was Luke Skywalker.

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:28.391
Jedi Master.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.393
A legend.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.876
The galaxy may need a legend.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:48.758
I need someone to show me
my place in all this.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.318
And you didn't fail Kylo.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.158
Kylo failed you.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.553
I won't.

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.073
The main cruiser's
still keeping beyond range.

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.392
But their medical frigate is out of fuel

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.272
and its shields are down.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.317
The beginning of their end.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.552
Destroy it.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.911
The last of our crew has been evacuated
and heading your way.

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.598
It's been an honor, admiral.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.637
Godspeed, Rebels!

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.035
Admiral,

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.717
fuel reserves at six hours.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.557
Maintain our current course.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.073
Steady on.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.150
Finn,

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.436
Rose, where are you guys?

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:13.949
Deal me in.

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.070
Thanks.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:23.237
Finn, the fleet
is running on fumes.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.873
Without a codebreaker
to break us onto Snake's Star Destroyer...

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.673
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.834
Unless you got a thief in your pocket,
our plan is shot.

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.240
Um, I can do it.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.390
What?

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.195
What?

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.150
What?

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.913
S-S-Sorry, I just

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.357
couldn't help but overhear all the stuff

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:53.398
that you were saying really loudly

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.434
while I was trying to sleep.

01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.039
Codebreaker?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.434
Thief?

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.595
I can do it.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.513
We're not talking about
picking pockets, okay?

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.471
Yeah.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.397
D-D-Don't let the wrapper
fool you, friend.

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:17.636
Me and the First Order
codeage go way back.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:20.595
And,

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:24.197
if the price is right,

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:30.356
I could break you into
old man S-S-Snoke's boudoir.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.037
- No.
- We're... We got it covered.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.954
Ha-Tuk-Ga.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.192
- Did he just...
- Yeah.

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.398
We gotta get out of here!
This way!

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.630
Why you little...

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.558
D-D-Did you do this?

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:09.715
Hey, hands up!

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.110
- Hands up!
- Yeah, man.

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.833
What's your story, roundie?

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.630
They went this way!

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.391
- Lock down all the exits.
- Wait.

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.553
That smelled great.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.552
Those cops will be here
any minute. What now?

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.918
Whoa! Ooh!

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.598
No, wait. Please, don't!

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.229
We're with the Resistance.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:39.197
Roger that.
Checking the stables now.

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:47.110
OFFICER 23 This way.

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:48.190
They must have
come through here.

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.350
Hyah!

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:03.231
Go. Go, go! Whoo!

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.680
Stop enjoying this!
Stop enjoying this!

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.556
We've got them.
They're not going anywhere.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:26.670
Ahhh!

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:37.750
Huh?

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.433
Move, move, move!
Get out of the way!

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:09.510
Our ship's on the beach straight ahead!

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.510
We need cover!

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:24.674
Too much cover!

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.314
There it is!

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.832
- No!
- Come on!

01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.877
Let the herd go.
Stick with the perps.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:06.675
Where 'd they go?

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:10.990
I think we lost him!

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.798
Now we get down to the beach
and circle back around...

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:13.990
Cliff!

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.194
We're trapped.

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.354
It was worth it, though.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.274
To tear up that town,

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.868
make 'em hurt.

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:43.470
Go.

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:49.749
Now it's worth it.

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.030
There they are.

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:09.194
BB-8! Wait, are you flying that thing?

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.234
Ah.

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.913
N-N-Need a lift?

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:11.790
Luke.

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.269
Leia.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.997
I'd rather not do this now.

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:27.034
Yeah, me, too.

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.993
Why did you hate your father?

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.430
Do you have something,

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.914
a cowl or something you could put on?

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:43.996
Why did you hate your father?
Give me an honest answer.

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:48.114
You had a father who loved you,
he gave a damn about you.

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.357
- I didn't hate him.
- Then why?

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:51.750
Why what?

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.714
Why what? Say it.

01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.360
Why did you...

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.117
Why did you kill him?

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.755
I don't understand.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:04.910
No?

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:06.673
Your parents threw you away
like garbage.

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.951
- They didn't!
- They did.

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.918
But you can't stop needing them.

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:12.309
It's your greatest weakness.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.230
Looking for them everywhere,

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.595
in Han Solo,

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.878
now in Skywalker.

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:23.078
Did he tell you what happened
that night?

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.430
Yes.

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:27.590
No.

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.998
He had sensed my power,

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.038
as he senses yours.

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.993
And he feared it.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:55.114
Liar.

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:00.914
Let the past die.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:04.830
Kill it if you have to.

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:10.119
That's the only way to become
what you were meant to be.

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:55.231
No! No!

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:37.119
Rey?

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:08.874
I should have felt
trapped or panicked.

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:10.519
But I didn't.

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:14.910
This didn't go on forever,

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.150
I knew it was leading somewhere.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:20.389
And that, at the end,
it would show me what I came to see.

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.959
Rey.

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.676
Let me see them.

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.151
My parents,

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.391
please.

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:16.591
I thought I'd find answers here.

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.554
I was wrong.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.872
I'd never felt so alone.

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.799
You're not alone.

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:34.240
Neither are you.

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.600
Rey?

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.073
It isn't too late.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:44.835
Stop!

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:57.113
Is it true?
Did you try to murder him?

01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:59.715
Leave this island now!

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.075
Stop.

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:03.350
Stop!

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:08.990
Did you do it?

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:11.191
Did you create Kylo Ren?

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.439
Tell me the truth.

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:50.637
I saw darkness.

01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:54.351
I'd sensed it building in him.

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:57.160
I'd seen it in moments
during his training.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.512
But then I looked inside,

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:02.713
and it was beyond
what I ever imagined.

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:10.110
Snoke had already turned his heart.

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:14.553
He would bring destruction,
and pain, and death,

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:17.678
and the end of everything I love
because of what he will become.

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:19.637
And for the briefest moment
of pure instinct,

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:21.996
I thought I could stop it.

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.549
It passed like a fleeting shadow.

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.317
And I was left with shame,

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.597
and with consequence.

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:35.237
And the last thing I saw

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:37.671
were the eyes of a frightened boy

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:40.229
whose master had failed him.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:42.910
Ben, no!

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:51.956
You failed him by thinking
his choice was made.

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:53.030
It wasn't.

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:55.278
There's still conflict in him.

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:58.080
If he were turned from the dark side,
that could shift the tide.

01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.992
This could be how we win.

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:03.152
This is not going to go
the way you think.

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:04.909
It is.

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.873
Just now when we touched hands,

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.314
I saw his future.

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:11.958
As solid as I'm seeing you.

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:15.956
If I go to him, Ben Solo will turn.

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:17.275
REY,

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.831
don't do this.

01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:37.313
Then he's our last hope.

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:19.834
Master Yoda.

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:23.115
Young Skywalker.

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:26.834
I'm ending all of this.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.629
The tree, the text, the Jedi.

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:30.995
I'm gonna burn it down.

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:51.989
Hmm.

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:09.834
Ah, Skywalker.

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:10.955
Missed you, have I.

01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:25.798
So it is time

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.158
for the Jedi Order to end.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:31.550
Time it is.

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:33.639
Hmm.

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:41.878
For you to look past
a pile of old books, hmm?

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:43.712
The sacred Jedi texts.

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:46.030
Oh. Read them, have you?

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:48.194
- Well, I...
- Page-turners

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:49.629
they were not.

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:52.157
Yes, yes, yes.

01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:53.680
Wisdom they held,

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:57.310
but that library contained
nothing that the girl Rey

01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:59.391
does not already possess.

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.233
Skywalker,

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:07.071
still looking to the horizon.

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.709
Never here, now, hmm?

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:12.480
The need in front of your nose.

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.270
Hmm?

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.798
I was weak.

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.030
Unwise.

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:22.760
Lost Ben Solo, you did.

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:25.915
Lose Rey, we must not.

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:29.159
I can't be what she needs me to be.

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:31.996
Heeded my words not, did you?

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.954
Pass on what you have learned.

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:37.236
Strength, mastery.

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.793
But weakness,

01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:42.349
folly, failure also.

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:45.638
Yes, failure most of all.

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:48.758
The greatest teacher, failure is.

01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:59.070
Luke,

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:05.071
we are what they grow beyond.

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:10.038
That is the true burden of all masters.

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:25.237
Four parsecs to go.
This thing really cooks.

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.073
I just hope we're in time.

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:28.639
You can actually do this, right?

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:31.191
Yeah, about that...

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:38.396
Guys, I can do it.

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:42.039
But there exists a pre-"do it"
conversation about price.

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:45.155
Once we're done, the Resistance
will give you whatever you want.

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:47.075
What you got deposit-wise?

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:50.156
Are you kidding me?
Look at us.

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:52.992
Is that Haysian smelt?

01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:56.960
That's something.

01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:59.316
No, we gave you our word.
You're gonna get paid.

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:00.635
That should be enough.

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.074
Guys, I wanna keep helping.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:06.670
But no something, n-n-no doing.

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.831
Okay, listen here, you've got...

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.038
Do it.

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:15.878
Now I can help.

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:19.430
Give it back.

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:21.910
What?

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.071
Give it back!

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:26.117
You have no idea how much
that medallion means to her.

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:29.718
What are you... Why are you
ransacking your own ship?

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:33.230
It's not your ship.

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.075
He says I stole it.

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:38.436
- Yeah, I got that.
- We stole it.

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:42.590
At least you're stealing
from the bad guys

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:44.230
and helping the good.

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:46.357
Good guys, bad GUYS,

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:48.557
made-up words.

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:52.830
Let's see who formerly owned
this gorgeous hunk-uh.

01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:58.156
Ah, this guy was an arms dealer.

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:02.157
Made his bank selling weapons
to the bad guys.

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:04.870
Oh...

01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:07.959
And the good.

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:12.313
Finn, let me learn you something big.

01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:15.836
It's all a machine, partner.

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:20.353
Live free, don't join.

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.789
That was the last of their support ships.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.035
It's just their main cruiser now.

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:38.079
And their fuel reserve?

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:39.958
By our calculation,

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:41.599
critical.

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:46.830
She in there?

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:47.910
The admiral's banned you
from the bridge.

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.474
- Let's not have a scene.
- No, let's.

01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:51.472
- Holdo?
- You're not allowed in here.

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:53.989
- Flyboy.
- Cut it, lady.

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.798
We had a fleet,
now we're down to one ship,

01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:57.598
and you've told us nothing!

01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:01.311
Tell us that we have a plan!

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:02.470
That there's hope!

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:04.039
When I served under Leia,

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.669
she would say,
hope is like the sun.

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:09.354
If you only believe in it
when you can see it...

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:11.750
You'll never make it
through the night.

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:13.520
Yes.

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:23.636
Are you fueling up the transports?

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.434
You are.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:32.389
All of them?

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:36.274
We're abandoning ship? Is that...

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:38.557
That's what you got?
That's what you brought us to?

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.270
Coward!

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:44.039
Those transport ships
are unarmed, unshielded.

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:46.476
We abandon this cruiser, we're done.

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.359
We don't stand a chance.
No, you are not just a coward,

01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:51.033
you are a traitor.

01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:53.990
Get this man off my bridge.

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:03.110
Finn,
Holdo's loading the crew in the shuttle.

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.998
She's going to abandon ship.
Where are you?

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:06.878
Poe, we're on our way
back to the fleet.

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.189
We're so close.

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:09.395
Did you find the Master Codebreaker?

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.676
Well, we found a codebreaker.

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:13.190
We can shut the tracker down.

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.271
Just buy us a little more time.

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:17.998
All right. Hurry.

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:24.952
As soon as I launch,
you jump back out of range.

01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.873
Stay there until you get my signal
for where to rendezvous.

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:32.479
If you see Finn before I do,

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:33.550
tell him...

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:37.512
Yeah, perfect. Tell him that.

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:46.830
Cloaking our approach.
We should be off their scopes.

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:49.950
Then we slice a slit in their shield.

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:51.758
Blip bloppity bloop,

01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:54.757
and slip right through.

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:16.318
So a stormtrooper
and a who now are doing what?

01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:17.629
They are trying to save us.

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:19.393
This is our best chance for escape.

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:21.511
You have to give Finn and Rose
all the time that you can.

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:24.035
You have bet the survival
of the Resistance

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:26.953
on bad odds and put us all at risk.

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:28.269
There's no time now.

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:30.471
We have to get clear of the cruiser.
Load the transports.

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:31.550
Right away, admiral.

01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:32.755
Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that.

01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:34.797
Vice Admiral Holdo,

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:36.678
I am relieving you
of your command

01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:40.117
for the survival of this ship,
its crew, and the Resistance.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.230
I hope you understand
what you're doing.

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:44.750
Yeah.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.115
I'm going to the bridge.

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.271
If they move, stun them.

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:09.952
...at least three cycles so far.

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:11.633
Yes, sir. We are working on it.

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.751
OFFICER 31 I will do my best, sir.

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:32.155
Almost there.

01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:43.072
You don't have to do this.

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:45.233
I feel the conflict in you.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:47.118
It's tearing you apart.

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:50.515
Ben, when we touched hands,

01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:52.193
I saw your future.

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.789
Just the shape of it,
but solid and clear.

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:57.590
You will not bow before Snoke.

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:02.199
You'll turn.

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:06.078
I'll help you.

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:08.153
I saw it.

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:09.958
I saw something, too.

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:12.390
Because of what I saw,

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.995
I know when the moment comes,
you'll be the one to turn.

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:17.518
You'll stand with me.

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.190
Rey,

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:22.710
I saw who your parents are.

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:41.912
Well done, my good
and faithful apprentice.

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:46.278
My faith in you is restored.

01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:49.630
Young Rey.

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:53.319
Welcome.

01:32:58.680 --> 01:32:59.954
So this is it.

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:01.997
The tracker's right behind this door.

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:17.316
Haysian smelt.

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:19.159
Best conductor.

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:29.273
And you're welcome.

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:33.112
Good time to figure out
how we get back to the fleet?

01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.953
I know where the nearest escape pods are.

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:36.030
Course you do.

01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:37.918
BB-8, tell me something good.

01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:40.995
Poe, we're almost there.

01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:42.389
Have the cruiser prepped for lightspeed.

01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:44.750
Yeah, I'm on it, pal. You just hurry.

01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:48.871
Clear the bridge, escort the
officers down to the hangar.

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:50.553
Commander... Captain Dameron,

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:52.517
Admiral Holdo was looking for you.

01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:53.829
Yeah, we spoke.

01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:57.510
Sir, I am almost afraid to ask.

01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:59.512
Good instinct, Threepio. Go with that.

01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:13.270
Seal that door!

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:17.115
We're running out of time.

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:18.429
Come on, how's it going?

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:20.159
Almost there.

01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:23.032
Threepio, where do you think
you're going?

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:25.191
It would be quite against
my programming

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.078
- to be party to a mutiny.
- Hey!

01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:29.072
It is not correct protocol.

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:32.354
Oh! Neither is this!

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.397
Finn? We're ready to make the jump!

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:35.829
Now or never.

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:40.799
Now.

01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:48.830
You're up.

01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:08.836
- You there, hands up!
- Watch 'em, watch 'em.

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:10.957
- Drop your weapons, now!
- Hands up, Rebel scum.

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:12.713
Get down! I said, down!

01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:24.278
FN-2187.

01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:28.515
So good to have you back.

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:30.475
They didn't make it.

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:45.515
Leia.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.354
Please board the transports

01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:00.756
according to your
evacuation designation.

01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:01.910
All transports must be cleared...

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.149
Okay, help me push him up, guys.

01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:05.039
That one's a troublemaker.

01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:06.909
I like him.

01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:08.675
Me, too.

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:11.391
Now, time to board your transport.

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:14.198
For the transports to escape,

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:18.158
someone needs to stay behind
and pilot the cruiser.

01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:24.319
Too many losses.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.116
I can't take any more.

01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:29.754
Sure you can.

01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:33.197
You taught me how.

01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:36.914
May the Force be...

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:40.678
You go on. I've said it enough.

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:45.910
May the Force be with you always.

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:53.914
Cloaking device activated.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.832
We should be off their scopes.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.389
Let's hope this works.

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.316
Come closer, child.

01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:22.634
So much strength.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.072
Darkness rises,

01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:29.989
and light to meet it.

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:34.834
I warned my young apprentice
that as he grew stronger,

01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:37.720
his equal in the light would rise.

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:41.390
Skywalker...

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:43.312
I assumed.

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:45.390
Wrongly.

01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:50.438
Closer, I said.

01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:58.992
You underestimate Skywalker,

01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:00.835
and Ben Solo,

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:02.794
and me.

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:05.311
It will be your downfall.

01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:06.589
Oh...

01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:08.871
Have you seen something?

01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:12.278
A weakness in my apprentice.

01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:14.431
Is that why you came?

01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:18.873
Young fool.

01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:22.755
It was I who bridged your minds.

01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:26.556
I stoked Ren's conflicted soul.

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:29.838
I knew he was not strong enough
to hide it from you.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.234
And you were not wise enough
to resist the bait.

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:40.120
And now,

01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:45.516
you will give me Skywalker.

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:49.155
Then I will kill you

01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:52.034
with the cruelest stroke.

01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:53.870
No.

01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:55.749
Yes.

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:02.474
Give me

01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:05.518
everything.

01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:07.753
No! No!

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:09.275
No!

01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:17.998
No. No.

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:19.355
No, no, no!

01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:25.350
Poe.

01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:32.070
What is that?

01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:34.038
The mineral planet, Crait.

01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:36.555
An uncharted hideout from
the days of the Rebellion.

01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:38.957
- That's a Rebel base?
- Abandoned,

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:40.430
but heavily armored

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:41.590
with enough power

01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:42.875
to get a distress signal to our allies

01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:44.229
scattered in the Outer Rim.

01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:46.198
Holdo knew the First Order

01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:47.509
was tracking our big ship.

01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:50.513
They're not monitoring
for little transports.

01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:53.236
So we could slip down
to the surface unnoticed

01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:56.677
and hide till the First Order passes.

01:39:58.840 --> 01:39:59.910
That could work.

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:03.517
She was more interested

01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:05.995
in protecting the light than she was

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:09.029
seeming like a hero.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.274
Godspeed,

01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:23.994
Rebels.

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:55.074
Well done, Phasma.

01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:58.953
Your ship and payment, as we agreed.

01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:08.433
You lying snake.

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:15.556
We got caught,

01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:18.311
I cut a d-d-deal.

01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.155
Wait,

01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.160
cut a deal with what?

01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:23.913
Sir, we checked on the
information from the thief.

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:26.875
We ran a decloaking scan,
and sure enough,

01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:29.350
30 Resistance transports
have just launched from the cruiser.

01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:32.710
He told us the truth.

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:35.193
Will wonders never cease?

01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:36.390
No.

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:37.830
Our weapons are ready?

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.354
Ready and aimed, sir.

01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:41.838
Fire at will.

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:44.073
Wait. No, no. No, you can't!

01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:45.994
No!

01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:01.753
Admiral, we're taking fire!

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:03.354
- Do we turn around?
- No, you're too far out.

01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:05.158
Full speed to planetfall.

01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:06.310
Full speed!

01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:14.157
Well, Well,

01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:17.995
I did not expect Skywalker
to be so wise.

01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:21.160
We will give him and the Jedi Order

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:23.715
the death he desires.

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:25.589
After the Rebels are gone,

01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:27.239
we will go to his planet

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:31.234
and obliterate the entire island.

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:39.439
Such spunk.

01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.235
Look here now.

01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:53.709
The entire Resistance
on those transports...

01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:58.069
Soon they will all be gone.

01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:01.558
For you, all is lost.

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:09.594
Ooh. And still that fiery spit of hope.

01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:14.392
You have the spirit of a true Jedi!

01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:24.200
And because of that,

01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:26.719
you must die.

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:31.670
My worthy apprentice,

01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:35.595
son of darkness,
heir apparent to Lord Vader.

01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:39.196
Where there was conflict,
I now sense resolve.

01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:42.074
Where there was weakness, strength.

01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:44.473
Complete your training,

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:49.192
and fulfill your destiny.

01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:00.113
I know what I have to do.

01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:03.275
Ben.

01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:07.156
You think you can turn him?

01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:09.518
Pathetic child.

01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:13.469
I cannot be betrayed,

01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:15.717
I cannot be beaten.

01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:18.235
I see his mind,

01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:21.472
I see his every intent.

01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:22.550
Yes.

01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:29.758
I see him turning
the lightsaber to strike true.

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:31.390
And now,

01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:34.077
foolish child,

01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:36.197
he ignites it,

01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:40.390
and kills his true enemy!

01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:23.238
Come on, give it full thrusters.
Full speed!

01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:24.799
I am, sir.

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:28.993
You murdering bastard!

01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:31.790
T-T-Take it easy, Big F.

01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:35.073
They blow you up today,
you blow them up tomorrow.

01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:37.438
It's just business.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.195
You're wrong.

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:45.915
Maybe.

01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:30.390
Ben!

01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:43.829
The fleet.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:44.990
Order them to stop firing.

01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:46.958
There's still time to save the fleet.

01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:56.750
Ben?

01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:00.917
It's time to let old things die.

01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:04.754
Snoke,

01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:06.194
Skywalker.

01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:09.594
The Sith,

01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:12.112
the Jedi, the Rebels...

01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:13.634
Let it all die.

01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:15.315
Rey.

01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:18.839
I want you to join me.

01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:23.360
We can rule together
and bring a new order to the galaxy.

01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:24.919
Don't do this, Ben.

01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:27.150
Please don't go this way.

01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:30.790
No, no. You're still
holding on! Let go!

01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:34.236
Do you wanna know the truth
about your parents?

01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:36.639
Or have you always known?

01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:40.799
And you've just hidden it away.

01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:44.353
You know the truth.

01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:46.634
Say it.

01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:50.989
Say it.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.513
They were nobody.

01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:56.318
They were filthy junk traders

01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:58.391
who sold you off for drinking money.

01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:03.558
They're dead in a paupers'
grave in the Jakku desert.

01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:06.277
You have no place in this story.

01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:08.431
You come from nothing.
You're nothing.

01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:14.034
But not to me.

01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:19.110
Join me.

01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:33.635
Please.

01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:05.030
Sir,

01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:08.393
the Resistance cruiser's
preparing to jump to lightspeed.

01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:10.270
It's empty-

01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:12.238
They're just trying
to pull our attention away.

01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:13.869
Pathetic.

01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:16.230
Keep your fire on the transports.

01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:46.799
Execution by blaster
is too good for them.

01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:48.997
Let's make this hurt.

01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:55.710
Finn.

01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:01.953
On my command.

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:08.034
She's running away.

01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:11.309
No, she isn't.

01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:28.198
- No!
- Fire on that cruiser!

01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:43.030
Execute.

01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:28.230
Finn!

01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:31.279
There's a shuttle back that way!
We gotta go!

01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:48.114
Traitor!

01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:50.790
What?

01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:15.110
Finn!

01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:36.272
You are a bug in the system.

01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:37.835
Let's go, chrome dome.

01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:46.635
Come on!

01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:57.310
No!

01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:04.270
Hey-

01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:22.880
You were always scum.

01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:25.953
Rebel scum.

01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:41.670
Hey! Need a lift?

01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:21.556
What happened?

01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:23.833
The girl murdered Snoke.

01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:29.634
What happened?

01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:32.360
She took Snake's escape craft.

01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:34.159
We know where she's going.

01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:36.878
Get all our forces down
to that Resistance base.

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:38.794
Let's finish this.

01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:40.749
Finish this?

01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:43.431
Who do you think you're talking to?

01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:46.394
You presume to command my army?

01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:50.516
Our Supreme Leader is dead!
We have no ruler!

01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:58.351
The Supreme Leader is dead.

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:03.438
Long live the Supreme Leader.

01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:23.430
They're coming, shut the door.

01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:32.873
Incoming!

01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:38.357
Go! Go! Move!

01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:41.277
Get that shield door down!

01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:58.440
No! Wait, don't shoot! It's us!

01:56:58.520 --> 01:56:59.555
No! Don't shoot!

01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:00.710
Hold your fire!

01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:02.917
- Don't shoot!
- Hold your fire!

01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:06.709
- Finn?
- Finn!

01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:08.918
Rose! You're not dead!

01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:10.315
Where's my droid?

01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:12.635
Buddy!

01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:15.314
I'm so glad to see you!

01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:18.870
Wait, what?
Wait, wait, wait, slow down.

01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:20.314
Is this all that's left?

01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:32.876
All right, shields are up
so they can't hit us from orbit.

01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:34.429
Use whatever power we've got left

01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:36.637
to broadcast a distress signal
to the Outer Rim.

01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:38.473
Use my personal code.

01:57:38.960 --> 01:57:41.793
If there are any allies to the Resistance,

01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:43.475
it's now or never.

01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:46.111
Rose, what do you got?

01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:50.195
Rotting munitions, rusted artillery,
some half-gutted skim speeders.

01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:51.350
Well,

01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:53.794
let's just pray that big-ass door

01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:56.196
holds long enough for us
to get help.

01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:08.278
A battering ram cannon.

01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:10.078
A what now?

01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:11.919
Miniaturized Death Star tech.

01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:13.832
It'll crack that door open like an egg.

01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:16.318
There has to be a back way
out of here, right?

01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:19.358
BB-8, what do you got?

01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:23.357
BB-8 has analyzed
the mine's schematics.

01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:26.638
This is the only way in or out.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:34.990
Come on.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.229
We have allies.

01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:39.312
People believe in Leia.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.559
They'll get our message, they'll come.

01:58:42.120 --> 01:58:44.350
But we have to buy time.

01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:47.994
We gotta take out that cannon.

01:58:52.280 --> 01:58:53.270
On me! On me!

01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:55.470
SOLDIER 21 Move! Move!

01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:57.154
Go back! Gather your weapons!

01:58:57.320 --> 01:58:58.754
Get over here!

01:58:58.920 --> 01:58:59.910
Hold your fire!

01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:18.190
Salt.

01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:19.634
Ground forces, incoming.

01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:21.473
Copy that. On our way.

01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:40.029
Engage your mono-ski.

01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:41.759
The green toggle.

01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:52.949
All right, listen up.

01:59:53.160 --> 01:59:56.278
I don't like these rust buckets
and I don't like our odds, but...

01:59:56.760 --> 01:59:58.080
What the hell?

01:59:58.240 --> 01:59:59.514
Just keep it tight

01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:02.638
and don't get drawn in too close
till they roll that cannon out front.

02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:24.750
All right, ground forces,
lay down some fire!

02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:39.677
Thirteen incoming light craft.

02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:41.751
Shall we hold until we clear them?

02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:44.839
No. The Resistance is in that mine.

02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:46.509
Push through.

02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:52.873
Fighters, break off!

02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:05.839
Come on! We gotta hold them
till they pull up that cannon!

02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:23.317
Rose, you got three right behind you!

02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:32.190
I can't lose 'em!

02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:40.993
Whoo! Yeah!

02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:55.997
Whoo! I like this!

02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:07.672
Blow that piece of junk out of the sky!

02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:09.234
All fighters!

02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:18.073
Chewie, peel off from the battle.

02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:19.594
Draw them away from the speeders.

02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:27.038
She drew 'em off! All of 'em!

02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:28.793
Oh, they hate that ship!

02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:42.390
Chewie!

02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:14.750
There it is!

02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:21.075
That is a big gun.

02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:22.514
Okay, it's heavily armored.

02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:24.671
Our only shot is right down the throat.

02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:34.232
The cannon's opening. This is our chance.

02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:35.549
All firepower on those speeders.

02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:38.195
Concentrate all fire on the speeders!

02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:46.514
We're taking heavy losses.

02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:00.797
They're picking us all off.
We're not gonna make it.

02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:02.678
All right,
making my final approach.

02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:04.239
Target in sight, guns are hot.

02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:05.629
No! Pull Off!

02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:06.835
What?

02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:08.439
The cannon is charged!
It's a suicide run!

02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:09.954
All craft, pull away!

02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:12.191
- No! I'm almost there!
- Retreat, Finn!

02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:13.589
That's an order!

02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:24.750
Finn? It's too late! Don't do this!

02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:26.911
No! I won't let them win!

02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:30.917
No! Finn, listen to Poe!

02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:32.514
We have to retreat!

02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:46.995
The cannon is warming up now.

02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:48.355
Copy that. We see it.

02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:50.272
Preparing to fire.

02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:33.912
Move! Go, go! Quick!

02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:35.753
Let's go, let's go!

02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:43.355
Rose?

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:50.115
Rose?

02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:51.919
Rose?

02:05:52.840 --> 02:05:54.672
Why would you do that? Huh?

02:05:54.760 --> 02:05:56.637
I was almost there.

02:05:57.440 --> 02:05:58.919
Why would you stop me?

02:05:59.680 --> 02:06:01.796
I saved you,

02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:03.830
dummy.

02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:06.633
That's how we're gonna win.

02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:09.189
Not fighting what we hate,

02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:11.995
saving what we love.

02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:32.794
General Hux,

02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:34.519
advance.

02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:36.553
No quarter.

02:06:37.960 --> 02:06:39.519
No prisoners.

02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:44.511
Our distress signal's been
received at multiple points,

02:06:44.680 --> 02:06:46.751
but no response.

02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:49.072
They've heard us,

02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:51.556
but no one's coming.

02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:58.070
We fought till the end.

02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:05.349
But the galaxy has lost all its hope.

02:07:06.720 --> 02:07:08.154
The spark

02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:11.559
is out.

02:07:37.160 --> 02:07:38.719
Luke.

02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:49.754
I know what you're gonna say.

02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:52.792
I changed my hair.

02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:56.473
It's nice that way.

02:07:58.320 --> 02:07:59.958
Leia,

02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:02.110
I'm sorry.

02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:04.152
I know.

02:08:04.360 --> 02:08:06.556
I know you are.

02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:09.317
I'm just glad you're here

02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:11.799
at the end.

02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:15.032
I came to face him, Leia.

02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:19.270
And I can't save him.

02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:22.917
I held out hope for so long,

02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:28.240
but I know my son is gone.

02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:31.839
No one's ever really gone.

02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:09.272
Master Luke.

02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:33.310
Stop!

02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:02.476
I want every gun we have
to fire on that man.

02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:09.119
Do it.

02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:26.875
More!

02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:31.150
More!

02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:47.358
That's enough.

02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:50.996
That's enough!

02:10:56.920 --> 02:10:58.558
Do you think you got him?

02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:01.712
Now, if we're ready to get moving,

02:11:01.880 --> 02:11:04.076
we can finish this.

02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:05.355
Sir?

02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:33.160
Bring me down to him.

02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:36.353
Keep the door covered
and don't advance until I say.

02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:37.430
Supreme Leader,

02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:39.393
don't get distracted, our goal...

02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:43.109
Right away, sir.

02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:45.753
Med pack!

02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:47.997
I need a med pack!

02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:50.237
She's hurt pretty bad.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:10.274
It's Kylo Ren.

02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:11.675
Luke's facing him alone.

02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:13.194
Well, we should help him. Let's go.

02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:15.073
No, wait. Wait.

02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:31.395
Did you come back to say you forgive me?

02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:34.277
To save my soul?

02:12:36.040 --> 02:12:37.633
No.

02:12:56.520 --> 02:12:58.750
He's doing this for a reason.

02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:02.352
He's stalling so we can escape.

02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:03.430
Escape?

02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:04.590
He's one man against an army.

02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:06.193
We have to help him,
we have to fight.

02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:08.556
No, no. We are the spark
that'll light the fire

02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:10.233
that'll burn the First Order down.

02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:14.432
Skywalker's doing this
so we can survive.

02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:16.079
There's gotta be a way
out of this mine.

02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:17.309
Hell, how did he get in here?

02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:21.519
Sir, it is possible that
a natural unmapped opening exists.

02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:24.678
But this facility is such
a maze of endless tunnels

02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:26.558
that the odds of finding an exit

02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:29.314
- are 15,428...
- Shh. Shush. Hush. Shush up.

02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:30.959
Shut up!

02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:33.878
- To one.
- Listen.

02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:38.790
My audio sensors
no longer detect the...

02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:40.030
Exactly.

02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:48.639
Where'd the crystal critters go?

02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:55.310
Follow me.

02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:01.837
What are you looking at me for?

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:03.479
Follow him.

02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:17.589
If the beacon's right beneath us,
they've got to be somewhere.

02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:19.273
Keep scanning for life forms.

02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:30.593
This way.

02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:36.798
I see them! Chewie, there!

02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:53.359
No. No, no, no.

02:14:56.760 --> 02:14:57.750
No!

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:11.832
Lifting rocks.

02:15:51.920 --> 02:15:54.434
I failed you, Ben.

02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:57.635
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sure you are!

02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:00.871
The Resistance is dead.

02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:02.599
The war is over.

02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:04.791
And when I kill you,

02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:07.395
I will have killed the last Jedi.

02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:08.675
Amazing.

02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:12.995
Every word of what you just said
was wrong.

02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:18.478
The Rebellion is reborn today.

02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:22.671
The war

02:16:22.840 --> 02:16:24.513
is just beginning.

02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:29.600
And I will not be the last Jedi.

02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:11.437
I'll destroy her,

02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:13.637
and you,

02:17:13.799 --> 02:17:15.438
and all of it.

02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:20.270
No.

02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:24.630
Strike me down in anger
and I'll always be with you.

02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:29.351
Just like your father.

02:18:18.799 --> 02:18:19.790
No.

02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:26.236
See you around, kid.

02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:41.318
No!

02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:20.797
C'ai!

02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:22.837
Such a friend.

02:21:23.200 --> 02:21:24.918
Chewie!

02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:27.992
It looks good.

02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:29.589
That was crazy, man.

02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:32.519
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:34.155
I'm Poe.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:35.990
Rey.

02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:37.395
I know.

02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:51.711
When we get to the Outer Rim,
I have a contact there.

02:21:51.800 --> 02:21:53.029
Quite definitely possible.

02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:04.999
Luke is gone.

02:22:05.880 --> 02:22:07.279
I felt it.

02:22:07.880 --> 02:22:09.712
But it wasn't sadness or pain.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.310
It was peace and purpose.

02:22:14.280 --> 02:22:15.600
I felt it, too.

02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:21.193
How do we build a Rebellion from this?

02:22:25.640 --> 02:22:28.359
We have everything we need.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:49.798
Luke Skywalker,

02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:51.758
Jedi Master.
