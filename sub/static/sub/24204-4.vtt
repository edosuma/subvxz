-Everything okay?
-Yeah, just a case
I'm working on.

00:12.500 --> 00:13.819
I went out to confront her.

00:13.830 --> 00:15.491
Hyah!

Let me know what's happening.

06:21.710 --> 06:23.666
He thinks
he found Chris?

06:23.670 --> 06:26.161
He tracked down that nurse
whose phone Chris used.

06:26.170 --> 06:27.376
They were following her.

06:27.380 --> 06:28.950

-Maybe.

In the same place.

Ben, look.

06:37.290 --> 06:40.077
She's been out of the water
for a couple of days now.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.456
Last time,
it only took a day

06:41.460 --> 06:42.950
till she started drying out.

06:42.960 --> 06:46.669
Seems like she's able
to stay on land longer.

07:01.540 --> 07:03.167
Yeah?

07:04.710 --> 07:06.575
No way.

07:07.580 --> 07:09.116
Where are you?

07:10.670 --> 07:12.615
I'll be right there.

07:12.620 --> 07:14.167
They followed that nurse
to some military facility,

07:14.170 --> 07:16.206
got chased away.

07:16.210 --> 07:18.917
They're staked out
in front of her house
In Bremerton.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.615
Hey, wait.
I'm going with you.

07:20.620 --> 07:21.575
-Maddie.
-Ben, don't even.

07:21.580 --> 07:23.377
Me go.

07:23.380 --> 07:25.746
Ryn, I don't think
that's a good idea.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.536
This place,
it's very far from here.

07:27.540 --> 07:29.747
On land. You'd be trapped

07:29.750 --> 07:30.956
if you needed to go
back into the ocean.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.575
Look, if we find your sister,

07:32.580 --> 07:33.956
we'll bring her to you.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.609
We promise.

07:38.210 --> 07:40.166

07:40.170 --> 07:41.489
We can't just leave her here.

the worst coffee in town.

07:45.960 --> 07:47.916
I know, you say that
every morning.

07:47.920 --> 07:49.911
I'm a creature of habit.

That's one word for it.

Morning, Sheriff.

07:53.670 --> 07:55.114
Hey, Janine.

07:59.170 --> 08:00.956
You recover from last night?

08:00.960 --> 08:02.700
[scoffs]
Didn't even have a chance

08:02.710 --> 08:04.496
to get a buzz on
before you guys showed up,

08:04.500 --> 08:05.910
ruined all the fun.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.911
Serve and protect.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.071
Jerry's gonna manage that motel
right into the ground.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.070
Ahh.

08:21.670 --> 08:23.456
Janine, you have a look.

08:24.960 --> 08:27.167
No. No, never seen her.

08:27.170 --> 08:29.661
What's the deal with her?

08:29.670 --> 08:31.786
Just asking if you seen her.

08:31.790 --> 08:34.452
We weren't formally
introduced or anything,

08:34.460 --> 08:37.668
but, yeah, I saw her
at the party last night.

08:37.670 --> 08:39.661
She was with Maddie.

08:43.540 --> 08:44.666
[Ben sighs]

08:46.380 --> 08:48.666
I wonder why she can't
just get in the water

08:48.670 --> 08:49.614
then get back out
like last time?

08:49.620 --> 08:50.780
It's not that simple.

08:50.790 --> 08:52.075
You saw the video.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.957
Her bones_c_rack.
It's agonIZIng.

08:53.960 --> 08:56.997
I just wish we knew
how long she can last.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.456
The stories handed down

08:58.460 --> 09:00.075
say they can stay
longer and longer

09:00.080 --> 09:01.957
each time they come to land.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.871
I will wait

09:03.880 --> 09:05.745
for sister.

09:05.750 --> 09:08.742
I can't say for sure
we're gonna find her.

09:08.750 --> 09:10.570
Okay? We don't know.

09:12.290 --> 09:14.167
I wait.

09:14.170 --> 09:18.072
Stubborn creatures,
aren't they?

09:18.080 --> 09:19.820
Maddie?

09:19.830 --> 09:21.707
Let's go.

09:21.710 --> 09:25.783
Let's see what we _can do
about your skIn.

09:37.880 --> 09:39.700
[Chris] Where are we?

09:39.710 --> 09:42.531
This area, I don't know it.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.070
So what was that place?

09:52.080 --> 09:54.742
-Some kind of prison?
-[buttons click]

10:10.790 --> 10:13.167
Hey, are you all right?

10:13.170 --> 10:15.536
We need to get you
to a hospital, or...

10:17.080 --> 10:19.571
I think you might be
in shock.

10:25.540 --> 10:27.701
My name's Chris,
by the way.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.615
Donna, huh?

10:36.620 --> 10:39.248
You know, I had a nurse
in there named Donna?

[suspenseful music playing]

10:49.880 --> 10:52.496
[electrical circuits buzzing]

11:02.670 --> 11:05.412
We called you as soon
as we secured the site, sir.

11:05.420 --> 11:07.536
This is how we found it.

11:09.420 --> 11:11.285
Any survivors?

11:11.290 --> 11:13.167
[guard]
None, sir.

11:23.790 --> 11:26.998
[song playing on stereo]

11:32.330 --> 11:34.912
When Ryn goes back
in the water,

11:34.920 --> 11:36.706
I want to put
a tracking unit on her.

11:40.710 --> 11:41.745
What?

11:41.750 --> 11:43.991
I don't-- I don't know.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.536
I'm not sure
how I feel about that.

11:45.540 --> 11:46.871
She's not _
one of our sea |Ions.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.529
I know.

11:48.540 --> 11:51.703
What are we saying
if we ask her to do that?

11:51.710 --> 11:54.952
I just-- I wanna know
what she's doing out there.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.531
Her dive rate, range,
velocity.

11:57.540 --> 11:59.952
Yeah, I get it. I do.
And I want to know, too,

11:59.960 --> 12:01.996
but, babe, she trusts us.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.991
I want her to know we don't
think of her

12:04.000 --> 12:05.991
as some kind of experiment.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.456
She knows that.

12:07.460 --> 12:10.372
This way,
we can look out for her,

12:10.380 --> 12:12.371
make sure she's safe
if she gets caught.

12:12.380 --> 12:15.031
We owe that to her.

12:15.040 --> 12:17.747
I don't want
to just let her go.

12:24.210 --> 12:26.451
This should help
for a little while.

12:26.460 --> 12:29.281
It's castor oil, sea salt,

12:29.290 --> 12:31.952
buttermilk, and Boswellia.

12:33.290 --> 12:35.201
Old family recipe.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.956
I wouldn't eat that if--

12:39.960 --> 12:43.532
[laughs]

12:43.540 --> 12:45.326
Can't say
I didn't warn you.

12:45.330 --> 12:47.321
[chuckling]

13:00.080 --> 13:03.709
They call it
an autoimmune response.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.377
That's the word they use

13:09.380 --> 13:12.372
when they don't understand
what something is.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.076
You have to sit still
for a little while.

13:19.080 --> 13:19.910
Let it soak in.

13:39.500 --> 13:44.073
Why did you and your sister
come so close to the surface?

13:44.080 --> 13:46.913
You know better.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.706
I'm sure
you've been warned.

[footsteps]

14:40.420 --> 14:42.820
Hey, wake up.

14:42.830 --> 14:43.956
I wasn't sleeping.

14:43.960 --> 14:45.700
Yeah,
we were surveilling.

14:51.710 --> 14:54.497
It's 10 AM.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.991
She should have
been home by now.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.786
Maybe she's working a double.

15:02.210 --> 15:03.780
Well,
we can't just sit here.

15:03.790 --> 15:05.997
You got a better idea?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.661
Yeah, let's get in there,

15:07.670 --> 15:08.785
figure out
who the hell she is.

15:19.420 --> 15:21.456
They teach you that
in college?

15:21.460 --> 15:23.280
No, grad school.

15:28.210 --> 15:29.609
What are we looking for?

15:29.620 --> 15:32.953
Anything to do with Chris,
that facility, this nurse.

15:32.960 --> 15:35.952
She's got a serious thing
for pigs.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.450
Hey, check this out.

15:39.790 --> 15:41.030
That's her, right?

15:42.210 --> 15:43.575
Yeah, yeah.

15:43.580 --> 15:45.241
Yeah, so she was
in the military, so what?

15:45.250 --> 15:46.376
Those guys who took Chris,

15:46.380 --> 15:47.916
they were
some black ops, right?

15:47.920 --> 15:49.456
That's what it felt like.

15:49.460 --> 15:50.700
I mean, she's gotta be
a part of that, too.

15:50.710 --> 15:52.371
Some kind of specialized
medical unit.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.377
Shit. Someone's here
we gotta go.

16:00.380 --> 16:02.075
Gotta go.
G0, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90!

16:03.830 --> 16:05.536
Go. Right.

16:10.620 --> 16:11.609
Shh!

16:15.670 --> 16:17.114
[bag unzipping]

16:29.670 --> 16:31.570
What are they looking for?

16:35.040 --> 16:36.610
[Calvin] I don't know.

16:36.620 --> 16:39.874
Maybe an ID. or something
tying her to that place.

16:46.290 --> 16:48.918
Something's definitely
going down.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.456
Like what?

16:50.460 --> 16:51.870
I don't know.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.495
But if they're here,

16:53.500 --> 16:55.616
I don't think
Donna's comIng home.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.286
We gotta get back to that site.

17:02.290 --> 17:04.531
Man, we were just there
last night.

17:04.540 --> 17:05.666
They came at us
with machine guns.

17:05.670 --> 17:06.739
You got a plan
to get past that?

17:08.330 --> 17:10.821
I don't want to wind up
in one of those duffel bags.

17:20.170 --> 17:22.912
[mermaid screaming]

17:22.920 --> 17:24.114
[woman screams]

17:45.580 --> 17:48.242
[technicians shouting]

17:48.250 --> 17:50.912
[screams and shouts]

17:54.710 --> 17:55.825
[man]
She's out of the tank!

17:55.830 --> 17:58.492
[crashes and screams]

17:58.500 --> 18:00.491
Fast-forward. Hurry.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.168
[alarm sounding]

18:12.080 --> 18:14.036
Where the hell did she go?

18:14.040 --> 18:15.416
Bring up
the other cameras.

18:23.380 --> 18:25.575
My God.

18:25.580 --> 18:27.821
[technician]
Is that her?

18:27.830 --> 18:28.819
Zoom that in.

18:31.290 --> 18:33.246
[Decker] She's walking.

18:40.120 --> 18:43.453
[Donna screaming]

18:52.250 --> 18:54.787
She knew to put clothes on.

18:58.170 --> 19:01.116
All this time,
we thought we were
studying her.

19:03.380 --> 19:05.245
[Decker, muffled]
Just getting
the blood work results in.

19:12.790 --> 19:14.280
She was studying us.

19:14.290 --> 19:15.666
[keyboard clicking]

19:26.460 --> 19:27.870
[groans]

19:27.880 --> 19:30.451
You, uh...

19:30.460 --> 19:32.325
You have any pills?

19:32.330 --> 19:35.822
You know,
for the pain?

19:35.830 --> 19:37.411
[clears throat]

19:37.420 --> 19:38.614
You all right?

19:38.620 --> 19:40.076
[clicks tongue]

19:40.080 --> 19:43.038
[small gasp]

19:43.040 --> 19:44.826
You just need some water.

19:47.380 --> 19:49.280
Hey, you have a phone.

19:49.290 --> 19:50.951
Hey, can I use--

19:50.960 --> 19:53.326
-[hissing]
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:53.330 --> 19:56.379
Just... the phone, okay?
Just...

19:57.500 --> 19:58.706
All right?

20:02.750 --> 20:04.706
[beeping]

20:06.460 --> 20:08.530
Damn it.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.417
[growls]

20:10.420 --> 20:12.376
There's no signal here.

20:19.620 --> 20:24.114
[rock music playing]

20:33.250 --> 20:35.957
[volume increases]

20:35.960 --> 20:38.451
Metalhead, huh?

20:38.460 --> 20:40.416
[hissing]

20:45.830 --> 20:49.243
-[screaming]
-Wait! Wait! Hey! Hey!

20:49.250 --> 20:51.821
[hissing]

21:08.290 --> 21:11.782
[Helen]
You need to go back now.

21:11.790 --> 21:13.530
You can't wait any longer.

21:13.540 --> 21:14.996
No.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.414
Ryn, I am going to take
you back to the water

21:19.420 --> 21:21.490
if I have to carry you
there myself.

21:21.500 --> 21:23.115
No.

21:25.210 --> 21:27.917
In the water,

21:27.920 --> 21:29.990
I go eat.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.319
Yeah.

21:31.330 --> 21:33.412
You... eat

21:33.420 --> 21:35.411
in the water.

21:35.420 --> 21:39.379
[panﬁng]

21:39.380 --> 21:44.283
My sister, she follow me.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.456
Me.

21:48.580 --> 21:50.286
Oh.

21:58.330 --> 22:01.538
It was your idea
to come close
to the surface.

22:06.040 --> 22:09.453
You blame yourself
for her getting caught.

22:27.420 --> 22:29.240
Yeah, it wasn't
like this yesterday.

22:29.250 --> 22:31.571
Yeah, sounds like
they're on the move.

22:31.580 --> 22:34.071
Holy shit.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.820
You think that's Chris?

22:38.000 --> 22:39.456
That he's dead?

22:39.460 --> 22:41.246
Hang on.
We don't know for sure.

22:43.670 --> 22:44.785
I'm not gonna sit around
and wonder. Come on.

22:44.790 --> 22:46.371
Wait!
Where are you going?

22:46.380 --> 22:47.369
Gonna follow 'em.

22:47.380 --> 22:48.779
Xander, be careful.

22:54.790 --> 22:57.611
[phone vibrating]

22:57.620 --> 22:58.871
Hello?

23:00.380 --> 23:02.575
How bad?

23:05.540 --> 23:07.496
Okay. We're coming.

23:07.500 --> 23:08.956
Helen.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.496
Ryn's in bad shape.

23:11.620 --> 23:13.326
We'll take her
to the Mammal Center.

23:13.330 --> 23:14.456
Maybe we can help her there.

23:16.330 --> 23:17.786
There's nothing we can do here.

23:19.040 --> 23:20.109
-Okay.
-Let's go.

23:34.170 --> 23:35.489
[Chris groans]

23:37.330 --> 23:40.663
I'm gonna see
if they have a map.

23:40.670 --> 23:42.740
[exhales]

23:42.750 --> 23:44.706
[groans]

23:44.710 --> 23:48.532
Wa... ter.

23:51.040 --> 23:52.530
It's right there.

24:02.710 --> 24:05.952
Wa... ter.

24:09.250 --> 24:10.490
Um...

24:12.040 --> 24:13.780
Okay.

24:13.790 --> 24:15.610
Come here.

24:16.620 --> 24:20.579
Look, water.

24:20.580 --> 24:22.912
Have as much as you want.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.206
-[screams]
-Whoa!

24:25.210 --> 24:26.495
What?!

24:36.500 --> 24:38.320
So now you're leaving?

24:41.710 --> 24:43.325
Come on!
It's not safe!

24:45.210 --> 24:47.201
Donna, come back!

24:52.540 --> 24:55.782
[helicopter passing]

24:55.790 --> 24:58.577
I had to lower
her dosage.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.207
She was nonresponsive.

25:00.210 --> 25:02.872
I doubt the families
of the people she killed

25:02.880 --> 25:05.576
would be satisfied
with that explanation.

25:05.580 --> 25:07.787
We would have lost her, sir.

25:07.790 --> 25:10.497
So it was personal.

25:10.500 --> 25:12.206
You didn't
want to let her die.

25:12.210 --> 25:13.575
Personal?

25:13.580 --> 25:15.161
I've been getting reports

25:15.170 --> 25:17.491
that you've been here
at all hours.

25:17.500 --> 25:20.742
That you may have lost
your professional detachment.

25:20.750 --> 25:23.617
I was keeping
a detailed account

25:23.620 --> 25:25.326
of her progress, sir.

25:26.620 --> 25:27.917
Well, the only progress
I see

25:27.920 --> 25:29.706
is we know
they can transform,

25:29.710 --> 25:35.068
which poses
a whole new security threat.

25:35.080 --> 25:37.378
They could be
living among us.

26:12.540 --> 26:13.700
Come on.

26:15.250 --> 26:17.571
Get in.

26:20.670 --> 26:22.956
Here, drink this.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.951
It could help you stay
hydrated from the inside.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.245
[coughing]

26:31.380 --> 26:32.950
Mm, bad.

26:32.960 --> 26:36.327
I know, but it'll keep
your sodium level up.

26:36.330 --> 26:37.911
I added spinach and avocado
for extra potassium.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.160
Come on.

26:40.710 --> 26:42.416
[hisses]

26:45.080 --> 26:47.708
Your body
is breaking down.

26:47.710 --> 26:49.325
Remember last time?

26:49.330 --> 26:51.707
Your lungs
are gonna shut down
if you don't go back.

26:51.710 --> 26:53.246
-[door opens]
-No.

26:53.250 --> 26:54.911
[Dale] Maddie?

26:54.920 --> 26:56.114
-Made|ine!
-Shit.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.451
[Dale] Hello?

26:59.920 --> 27:00.739
Are you here?

27:00.750 --> 27:02.741
-Hi, Dad.
-Mads.

27:02.750 --> 27:05.992
Is this a bad time?

27:06.000 --> 27:07.456
No, no, perfect.

27:07.460 --> 27:08.529
I was just, um, studying.

27:08.540 --> 27:09.916
What's up?

27:09.920 --> 27:12.241
I just... I haven't
seen you around in a while.

27:12.250 --> 27:13.376
I miss you.

27:13.380 --> 27:14.916
Me, too. It's just

27:14.920 --> 27:17.206
between work and classes,
I've been slammed.

27:17.210 --> 27:18.700
Just been crashing at Ben's.

27:18.710 --> 27:21.611
Well, that's good.

27:21.620 --> 27:24.578
_ You haven't seen
thIs gIrl around, have you?

27:24.580 --> 27:25.990
[Maddie] No.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.242
Why? Is this part
of that, uh, murder case?

27:29.250 --> 27:30.615
Trying to figure that out.

27:30.620 --> 27:32.747
Have a good look.

27:32.750 --> 27:34.536
I told you
I haven't seen her.

27:34.540 --> 27:36.110
Why do you keep asking?

27:36.120 --> 27:39.533
Well, it's just somebody
said they saw you with her

27:39.540 --> 27:41.167
at Jerry's party last night.

27:41.170 --> 27:42.740
Someone?

27:42.750 --> 27:44.957
Doug Pownall.

27:44.960 --> 27:47.576
[Maddie] Doug. Figures.

27:47.580 --> 27:49.821
Come on. You really think
I wouldn't tell you?

27:49.830 --> 27:52.788
Mm. Wonder
why he would say that?

27:52.790 --> 27:55.372
Who knows?
He's not my biggest fan.

27:55.380 --> 27:57.701
He keeps asking Ben
when he's gonna upgrade.

27:57.710 --> 27:58.779
She's dangerous, Maddie.

27:58.790 --> 28:00.610
I'm gonna find her.

28:00.620 --> 28:04.613
If you see her anywhere,
you let me know?

28:05.620 --> 28:06.780
Yeah.

28:06.790 --> 28:08.746
Hey, Sheriff?

28:08.750 --> 28:11.071
Dinner tonight?

28:11.080 --> 28:12.320
I'd love that.

28:15.460 --> 28:16.745
Okay.

28:16.750 --> 28:18.661
I'll walk you out.

28:20.620 --> 28:24.909
Look, I know that you
want to keep looking,

28:24.920 --> 28:27.286
but what good would
you be to your sister

28:27.290 --> 28:28.996
if you die?

28:29.000 --> 28:31.742
[wheezing]

28:37.710 --> 28:39.200
He's looking for her.

28:39.210 --> 28:40.450
He has that composite.

28:40.460 --> 28:41.825
He knows she was involved.

28:41.830 --> 28:43.286
Okay.

28:45.880 --> 28:47.780
Okay, what?

28:47.790 --> 28:49.997
I go back.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.490
There are three bags.

29:04.500 --> 29:05.876
Three bodies.

29:05.880 --> 29:07.245
Yeah.

29:09.120 --> 29:11.031
Hey, maybe, uh...

29:11.040 --> 29:13.031
Maybe Ben found something.
Could you just...

29:16.040 --> 29:17.780
[phone ringing]

29:17.790 --> 29:20.167
It's-- It's her.
It's Donna.

29:20.170 --> 29:22.821
Hello?

29:22.830 --> 29:24.536
[Chris] Hey, it's me.

29:24.540 --> 29:26.076
Chris?!

29:26.080 --> 29:27.991
Chris, you're alive?!

29:28.000 --> 29:30.412
I'm pretty messed up,
man.

29:31.710 --> 29:33.575
Uh, wh-where are you?

29:33.580 --> 29:35.912
I'm not far
from Libbey Beach.

29:35.920 --> 29:37.740
[panﬁng]

29:37.750 --> 29:39.877
I can't make it
much farther.

29:39.880 --> 29:42.030
Okay, just--
just hold on, all right?

29:42.040 --> 29:43.917
W-we'll be right there!
We're on our way!

29:46.920 --> 29:48.990
[tires squeal]

29:55.290 --> 29:58.077
[Ben] Ryn, we want you
to have this.

29:59.790 --> 30:01.109
A gift.

30:03.960 --> 30:07.953
Now, this part tells us
where you are,

30:07.960 --> 30:11.873
so if anything happens
to you, we can help.

30:13.290 --> 30:16.373
You don't have to_ wear it.
It's your ch0Ice.

30:33.170 --> 30:35.456
I come back.

30:38.830 --> 30:40.206
Sure.

30:40.210 --> 30:42.326
[wheezing]

30:42.330 --> 30:45.037
[phone vibrating]

30:45.040 --> 30:46.746
What is it?

30:49.830 --> 30:50.910
Ben?

30:50.920 --> 30:53.821
They found Chris.

30:53.830 --> 30:55.457
Sister.

30:55.460 --> 30:56.916
We don't know.

30:56.920 --> 30:58.035
I go with you.

30:58.040 --> 30:59.246
Ryn, you can't.

30:59.250 --> 31:03.243
My sister... is alive.

31:13.920 --> 31:16.616
[wheezing]

31:16.620 --> 31:18.997
Your father...

31:21.120 --> 31:23.076
a hunter?

31:23.080 --> 31:25.992
[wheezing]

31:27.920 --> 31:30.912
He only hunts bad people.

31:32.750 --> 31:34.490
Iam not...

31:35.920 --> 31:37.114
bad.

31:39.210 --> 31:42.828
No. He just
doesn't understand

31:42.830 --> 31:44.491
what happened in that car.

31:44.500 --> 31:46.821
He wants answers.

31:46.830 --> 31:48.991
You're good.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.707
[wheezing and coughing]

31:55.210 --> 31:56.950
-That's Chris!
-We'll be right back.

32:02.210 --> 32:03.996
[coughing]

32:27.500 --> 32:29.456
[Chris moaning]

32:29.460 --> 32:31.667
Chris!
Chris, hang in, man.

32:31.670 --> 32:34.616
Hey.
Hang in there, man.

32:34.620 --> 32:35.917
All right.

32:40.040 --> 32:41.496
Ben.

32:46.580 --> 32:47.786
Go.

32:51.250 --> 32:53.457
It's all right.
We got you.

32:53.460 --> 32:55.371
Hey, stay with me.

Chris! Chris!

33:02.460 --> 33:04.246
He needs help, man.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.787
-We gotta get him
to a hospital.
-No hospital!

33:06.790 --> 33:08.109
All right, the clinic.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.917
Doc Abbott can take
care of him.

33:11.960 --> 33:14.872
[Chris groaning]

33:16.120 --> 33:19.669

Ryn!

35:20.620 --> 35:22.201
That girl... ?

35:22.210 --> 35:24.201
Her sister.

35:25.210 --> 35:27.280
She found her.

35:31.210 --> 35:33.110
[high-pitched call]

35:48.040 --> 35:51.999
Crane arm broke free,
sliced him up.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.618
Whole town's

35:55.620 --> 35:57.281
What hospital was he in?

35:57.290 --> 36:00.168
Uh, military hospital.

36:04.790 --> 36:07.281
And they released him
in this condition?

36:09.960 --> 36:11.325
He's been through a lot.

36:11.330 --> 36:14.743
If there's any way
you can treat him here,

36:14.750 --> 36:17.071
we'd really appreciate it.

36:17.080 --> 36:20.618
This have anything to do
with that girl you've
been calling me about?

36:20.620 --> 36:21.917
No.

36:23.290 --> 36:24.416
Please...

36:24.420 --> 36:26.115
Dr. Abbott.

36:31.290 --> 36:32.496
All right, everyone
clear out of here.

36:32.500 --> 36:33.569
Give me some room to work.

36:33.580 --> 36:35.320

[exhales]

36:55.500 --> 36:56.410
Thank God.

36:56.420 --> 36:58.820
Where's Maddie?

36:58.830 --> 37:00.878
She went
back to my place.

37:00.880 --> 37:03.872
So who's that girl
that, uh, Dr. Abbott
was asking you about?

37:03.880 --> 37:05.416
You know, the one
you were calling about?

37:05.420 --> 37:08.412
Oh, just a volunteer
at the Mammal Center.

37:08.420 --> 37:10.820
Yeah, she started
showing up wasted,

37:10.830 --> 37:14.209
so I thought maybe I
could get her some help.

37:14.210 --> 37:16.371
Well, good, 'cause if I thought
you were cheating on Maddie,

37:16.380 --> 37:18.450
I'd have to kick your ass.

Dude, that's the place.

37:30.540 --> 37:32.371
That's the place where
they were holding Chris.

37:32.380 --> 37:34.701
They're cleaning up
loose ends.

37:34.710 --> 37:36.530
It's just like the dudes
with the duffel bags.

37:36.540 --> 37:37.609
They're wiping out
all of the evidence.

37:40.210 --> 37:41.370
They'll be coming for him.

38:09.460 --> 38:11.496

38:11.500 --> 38:14.287
Is it working?

Yeah. She's moving fast.

38:16.540 --> 38:19.282
Already 200 miles northwest.

38:19.290 --> 38:21.576
Wow.

38:21.580 --> 38:23.286
Where do you think
she's going?

38:25.460 --> 38:27.416
Home.

38:27.420 --> 38:30.787
[Maddie]
She's picking up speed.

38:40.120 --> 38:42.452
