He hadn't taken the car.

Your friend from M17"
was on the news.

00:27.660 --> 00:29.992
He said that Joe Turner
was in the CIA.

00:30.100 --> 00:32.352
The government would have you
believe that they were just
ciwi/ans caught

00:32.460 --> 00:36.237

American service members,

Well, I am a business man.
When I see a business
opportunity, I take It.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.225
Gentlemen, I give you Volaris.

[Gareth] Brutus has four-times
as many lines.

01:44.210 --> 01:46.963
[Ginny] Yeah, but it's called
Julius Caesar,
so don't you
think it's about him?

01:48.820 --> 01:52.278
-[Ginny sighing]
-No, it's about Brutus,

01:52.380 --> 01:55.031

the conflicting demands,

01:55.140 --> 01:57.074
[snorting] you know?

01:57.180 --> 01:59.319
Between what
he owes hIS country,

and what he owes his friend.
You're so fucking hot.

We ’re all friends
of Caesar.

02:06.670 --> 02:08.729
-[moaning]
-To him I say

02:08.840 --> 02:11.695
that Brutus' love to Caesar
was no less than his.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.252
[Brutus]
As he was valiant
I honor him,

02:15.360 --> 02:17.635

02:18.770 --> 02:20.761
I slew him.

-Oh, I can contain that, but,

02:54.400 --> 02:55.890
his greed

02:56.000 --> 02:58.309
has now almost twice cost
us this operation.

03:00.650 --> 03:02.641
And there mustn't be
a third time.

03:03.490 --> 03:05.503
Your allegiance to this mission

03:05.610 --> 03:09.046
has got to be greater than
your loyalty to any one person.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.291
You have a problem with that?

03:12.860 --> 03:14.714
No.

03:14.820 --> 03:18.358
-No, I don't.
-It's an inhuman business,
Nathan, and we must act

accordingly, while

03:20.310 --> 03:22.289
holding onto our humanity.

03:22.390 --> 03:28.329
We must always remind ourselves
that every life sacrificed
to this cause

03:28.430 --> 03:30.375
is a _soul whose loss
IS a tragedy,

This woman who pulled us
over, I could hear her from
the trunk. That was her.

04:36.340 --> 04:39.468
-That was the woman who tried
to kill me.
-Yup. She leaned in the car.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.445
Apparently she thought
she could smell you.

have brought me to your house.

in danger.

already died
over this fucking thing.

Yeah, [sighs] well,
I didn't put myself in this.

You have your Uncle Bob to
thank for that.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.162
Wait, you're working for Bob?

05:04.490 --> 05:06.503
He got shut out of
the Task Force investigation

05:06.610 --> 05:08.225
and he got me assigned.

05:08.330 --> 05:11.629
So, he, he knew that you
and Sarah were having
an undeclared relationship?

05:11.730 --> 05:13.391
-Yup.
-Did he blackmail you?

05:13.500 --> 05:15.434
He didn't have to. He knew
that I would want to know
the truth.

05:15.540 --> 05:18.395
-So what is the truth?
-I know who killed Sarah.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.876
That's just a piece of it.

05:19.980 --> 05:21.470
Well, it's the only piece
that matters to me.

05:21.580 --> 05:23.400
Listen to me, I need to get
in contact with Bob.

05:23.510 --> 05:25.501
He might be able to help me
figure out who's behind
this thing.

-Keep It.

Are you going after Joubert?

05:37.840 --> 05:40.456

she's a professional killer.

all the guns are for.

care of the rest.
-No, no, no, no, no.

from going after Joubert.

and get you.

is her lack of conscience.

11:40.760 --> 11:41.738
All right.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.831
[clerk]
Pressure over time.

11:44.360 --> 11:46.419
That's what makes them.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.499
[Nathan] I'll take them.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.682
-Your wife will love them.
-They're for my daughter.

11:51.290 --> 11:52.666
Very luclq girl.

11:52.770 --> 11:54.499
Is she getting married?

11:54.610 --> 11:57.522
-One day.
-And how will you be paying?

11:58.490 --> 12:00.879
Cash.

12:00.980 --> 12:04.632
[ops guy] These guys switch
phones so much, it's impossible
for us to be 100% certain.

12:04.740 --> 12:07.755
But based on our analysis
of his contact network
and call patterns,

12:07.860 --> 12:10.078
we're pretty sure
it is Abu-Saeed.

12:10.190 --> 12:12.442
He arrived in Jeddah
yesterday by car,

12:12.550 --> 12:15.769
and we triangulated
his cell signal to here.

12:15.870 --> 12:18.839
Now, the location is previously
unknown to us, but,

12:18.950 --> 12:22.249
even assuming it's defended,
we should still be able
to do this guy.

12:22.360 --> 12:23.850
[Bob] This is
a capture mission.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.416
Capture mission in Saudi?

12:25.520 --> 12:27.795
-Am I talking to
the wrong person?
-No, sir.

12:30.450 --> 12:33.942
-Let's make this happen.
-Yes, sir.

12:34.050 --> 12:36.985
[woman on phone]
Today we wﬂl
be discussing how to

12:37.090 --> 12:39.627
incremental/y shift

12:39.730 --> 12:44.349
our focus when we are trying
to recover from anything

12:44.460 --> 12:46.451
-that has...
-[door opens]

12:47.740 --> 12:49.731
Hello?

12:59.670 --> 13:02.150
Is someone there_?
I heard you come In.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.130
I have a gun.

13:06.240 --> 13:09.391
[Iris]
I know you listen.
Elden told me you listen.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.362
But I didn't tell her anything.

13:15.930 --> 13:17.921
[panﬁng]

13:27.220 --> 13:29.780
[ragged breathing]

13:31.790 --> 13:34.065
You heard what I said.
I didn't tell Mae anything.

13:53.610 --> 13:55.601
[sighs in relief]

14:03.260 --> 14:05.239
[woman on phone]
. . .miracu/ous ab/lity.

14:05.340 --> 14:07.331
Creator given. . .

14:09.980 --> 14:11.982
[sighing]

14:13.910 --> 14:17.528
. . .shou/d be able
to be objective

14:17.630 --> 14:21.828
about one is own
thought process.

14:23.960 --> 14:27.976
It’s totally fine,
ifin this moment

14:28.080 --> 14:30.332
you are freaking out a bit.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.442
[Iris muffled screaming]

14:42.090 --> 14:44.092
[Abbott clears throat]

14:46.140 --> 14:48.290
Bob, are you running
a capture op in Saudi?

14:49.900 --> 14:54.599
Ammar Nazari had a conversation
with Saeed Abu-Saeed

14:54.710 --> 14:57.463
in _the Charles De Gaulle
airport two years ago.

14:59.190 --> 15:03.615
Nazari's dead.
Saeed is our only lead.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.814
-I need to talk to him.
-You think this is going
to teach us something

15:06.920 --> 15:08.774
about ComQuest Field?

15:08.880 --> 15:11.451
I don't think we're going
to unlearn anything.

15:11.560 --> 15:14.700
It is only because
I have pulled every string
in my loom

15:14.810 --> 15:16.880
that you are here
in this building.

15:18.090 --> 15:20.081
And do you have any idea
why I did that?

15:22.450 --> 15:25.578
It is because I need you
more than I don't need you.

15:26.940 --> 15:28.931
But that could change.

15:31.140 --> 15:35.042
I do not want to have
to explain to State

15:35.150 --> 15:37.141
why the Saudis are calling.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.132
[door closes]

15:46.240 --> 15:50.552
Mmm-hmm. Bob Partridge is going
after Abu-Saeed.

15:51.720 --> 15:53.824
Now, I don't know
Abu-Saeed's status,

15:53.930 --> 15:56.683
but it could be problematic
if he and Bob speak.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.139
Mmm-hmm.

15:59.250 --> 16:03.027
No, I'm, I'm not worried about
him shutting down
the operation.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.711
He could expose it.

16:04.820 --> 16:07.175
And that could cause problems
for us personally, and for
the country.

16:08.260 --> 16:11.479
Oh, no.
No, we can't get rid of him.

16:11.580 --> 16:15.141
He's a National Intelligence
Officer with a lot of friends.

16:16.110 --> 16:17.247
It would be high risk.

16:17.350 --> 16:19.944
No, I'm... I'm suggesting
we bring him on board.

16:20.830 --> 16:22.889
Yes, I'm serious.

16:22.990 --> 16:25.697
Well, no, he's not one of us,
but he is a company man.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.336
And he is pragmatic.

16:27.440 --> 16:29.658
I'll watch over him closely,
and we'll play it by ear.

16:29.760 --> 16:31.899
Yeah, I gotta go, okay.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.707
-[line ringing]
-[watcher] Yes, sir.

16:34.810 --> 16:36.801
[Abbott]
Let’s start covering
our tracks.

16:37.210 --> 16:39.201
Erase everything.

16:42.450 --> 16:44.441
[key clicks]

17:57.690 --> 17:59.885
[muffled breathing]

18:09.380 --> 18:11.371
[starts engine]

18:43.410 --> 18:45.401
[Iris moaning]

18:47.340 --> 18:49.331
[grunts]

18:54.460 --> 18:56.451
You won't scream?

19:02.430 --> 19:04.364
[exhales]

19:04.470 --> 19:06.244
[Joubert] What do you think
of the suit?

19:06.350 --> 19:08.352
[gaSPSI

19:09.160 --> 19:11.754
Made it myself.
Doesn't leave any marks.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.436
[Iris gasping]

19:16.800 --> 19:18.802
So many drugs.

19:19.650 --> 19:21.925
You have a serious problem.
More than one.

19:23.450 --> 19:25.441
I don't know anything, I swear.

19:26.370 --> 19:28.372
-I swear_!
-Indoor vorce.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.891
Drink.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.331
-Drink.
-No.

19:39.630 --> 19:41.689
There are two ways this can go.

19:41.790 --> 19:43.360
You can have this drink.

19:43.470 --> 19:45.358
You can go peacefully.

19:45.470 --> 19:47.882
Or I can bash your skull in,
break your neck,

19:47.990 --> 19:49.992
and make it look like
you slipped in the shower.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.151
Come on.

19:57.880 --> 19:59.882
[cries out]

20:00.490 --> 20:03.584
Hmm. Slow down.
Tell me about this evidence.

20:03.690 --> 20:05.681
[grunts]

20:08.210 --> 20:10.349
[panﬁng]

20:10.460 --> 20:11.996
There's...

20:12.100 --> 20:14.091
There's nothing.

20:17.420 --> 20:19.820
-[Iris on tape]
I have proof
-It's not true.

20:21.030 --> 20:23.021
I have proof

20:25.510 --> 20:27.284
I was lying.

20:27.390 --> 20:29.392
I was trying
to hurt Mae Barber.

20:30.840 --> 20:32.831
Her husband killed my husband.

20:35.320 --> 20:37.311
No, he didn't.

20:43.890 --> 20:46.040
[splashing]

20:47.530 --> 20:49.816
[Elden]
Lulu, Lulu,

20:51.140 --> 20:53.131
Lulu, come here.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.156
What are you doing?

20:55.260 --> 20:57.353
What does it look like
I'm doing?

20:57.460 --> 20:59.451
[door opens]

21:43.190 --> 21:45.181
[Lulu barks]

21:47.030 --> 21:49.021
[Elden] So what can't wait
until tomorrow?

21:49.950 --> 21:52.214
My wife thinks I wanted
to meet a woman.

21:52.320 --> 21:53.617
[Nathan] Why did she say that?

21:53.720 --> 21:55.711
Did you have to bring him?

22:00.120 --> 22:02.065
[Nathan] You've been telling
tales out of school.

22:02.170 --> 22:03.421
[Elden]
What does that mean?

22:03.530 --> 22:05.384
You don ’t know the phrase
”You’ve been telling tales--”

22:05.490 --> 22:07.469
[Elden]
Why don ’t you
just tell me what you mean?

22:07.570 --> 22:09.561
-[Lulu barks]
-[gasp|ng]

22:12.940 --> 22:15.272
-Caleb Wolfe.
-I don't understand.

22:15.380 --> 22:17.393
[Lulu barking]

22:17.500 --> 22:20.435
What, you think I said
something to Caleb Wolfe
about the operation?

22:20.540 --> 22:22.485
-Yeah.
-I don't fucking know
Caleb Wolfe.

22:22.590 --> 22:25.764
The guy's a fugitive from
the law. How would I
even find him?

22:25.870 --> 22:27.440
[whispering] Back.

22:27.550 --> 22:28.847
Lulu, get the fuck back.

22:28.950 --> 22:32.295
Why the fuck would I say
something to Caleb Wolfe?

22:32.400 --> 22:34.391
Lulu! Come here!

22:35.800 --> 22:37.779
Come here.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.916
[panﬁng]

22:42.850 --> 22:45.307
[Elden] I honestly don't know
what the fuck
you're talking about.

22:45.410 --> 22:46.741
Sam, you want
to say something here?

22:46.850 --> 22:48.499
You're a very good liar,
you know that?

22:48.610 --> 22:50.783
You even got me convinced
I'm wrong.

22:50.890 --> 22:52.551
You are wrong.

22:52.660 --> 22:56.278
Consider what would
happen of it got out
about what we were doing.

22:56.380 --> 22:58.371
Think about it.

22:58.820 --> 23:02.563
The threat alone,
inside our own border.

23:02.670 --> 23:07.209
Instead of neutralizing
our enemy, we would become
their biggest recruiting tool.

23:07.310 --> 23:08.527
So why would I say anything?

23:08.630 --> 23:10.359
Maybe because you don't believe
in what we're doing.

23:10.470 --> 23:12.370
Maybe because you think
we've gone too far.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.493
You know, Nathan, I'm getting
fucking tired of hearing
your voice.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.329
Sam, you wanna chime in here?

23:16.440 --> 23:18.135
Are you telling me you believe
this fucking bullshit?

23:18.240 --> 23:20.231
Listen,
you recruited me, Elden,

23:21.240 --> 23:23.549
which means that my life,

23:23.650 --> 23:26.107
the lives of my family,
they're in your hands, so,

23:26.210 --> 23:28.201
if you did tell anyone

23:29.650 --> 23:31.538
then, brother, I think
you owe it to me to come clean.

23:31.650 --> 23:33.652
I would never do anything
to hurt you, Sam.

23:35.020 --> 23:36.715
This isn't personal.

23:36.820 --> 23:38.390
You know what?
Fuck you, Nathan!

23:38.500 --> 23:39.592
You should hear what
we say about you.

23:39.700 --> 23:42.919
Pathetic, oversized boy
playing soldier.

23:43.030 --> 23:45.601
Trying to win Daddy's love.
But you know what, you're
not a fucking soldier.

23:45.710 --> 23:47.689
-Do not talk to me like--
-[grunts]

23:47.790 --> 23:49.439
[Sam] Hey, let him up, Elden.
Elden!

23:49.550 --> 23:51.541
[Nathan] No, no, no, no.
[Sam] Elden!

23:53.560 --> 23:55.175
If he weren't here,
I'd fucking kill you.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.271
All right, come on.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.711
-Sam.
-It's all right.
Just walk away.

24:07.650 --> 24:09.641
[Sam] All right.

24:10.250 --> 24:11.945
How did we hook up with
these fucking crazy people?

24:12.050 --> 24:14.257
You hooked me up
with these crazy people.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.011
Did you say something, Elden?

24:19.540 --> 24:21.189
-To anyone?
-No.

24:21.300 --> 24:24.019
-Elden?
-No, I didn't, Sam,
but maybe...

24:28.110 --> 24:29.520
Maybe we've gone a bit far.

24:29.630 --> 24:32.724
I mean, the assassination
program was one thing,
but this...

24:32.830 --> 24:34.934
You know how many people
are going to die?

24:35.040 --> 24:37.076
Nobody said this was going
to be easy, Elden.

24:39.760 --> 24:43.435
It's up to us, people in
our positions, to make
that tough call.

24:43.890 --> 24:45.744
[sighing]

24:45.850 --> 24:49.001
Otherwise, there's no future.
You fucking get that, right?

24:51.330 --> 24:54.629
These people, these extremists,
they're spreading like
a fucking virus.

24:54.740 --> 24:56.731
Yeah.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.491
-Yeah, you're right.
-All right.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.091
So is there anything
that you want to tell me?

25:06.790 --> 25:09.463
Am I safe? Is my family safe?

25:10.230 --> 25:12.221
Of course they are, Sam.

25:17.240 --> 25:19.231
Good.

25:20.760 --> 25:22.955
Why don't you go home
to Iris, and we'll talk
tomorrow, okay?

25:29.730 --> 25:31.721
You're like a brother
to me, Sam.

25:32.610 --> 25:34.601
You too.

25:35.380 --> 25:37.359
Come here.

25:37.460 --> 25:39.451
Come here.

25:44.420 --> 25:46.422
[Elden] Lulu, come on.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.791
[panﬁng]

26:02.040 --> 26:03.450
Let's try again.

26:03.560 --> 26:05.562
Where is the evidence?

26:09.130 --> 26:11.701
There's a camera.
It was Elden's.

26:11.810 --> 26:13.801
That's what, not where.

26:14.690 --> 26:16.772
There's a safe in the bedroom.

26:18.460 --> 26:19.597
In the closet.

26:19.700 --> 26:21.691
[safe door opening]

26:26.870 --> 26:28.883
[panﬁng]

26:28.990 --> 26:30.719
Nice camera.

26:30.830 --> 26:32.821
I took it from Elden.

26:33.150 --> 26:35.141
I thought I'd catch him
cheaﬁng.

26:37.720 --> 26:40.609
I was gonna show him.
He probably wouldn't have
given a fuck.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.494
[Nathan ]
Have you been telling
tales out of school?

26:42.600 --> 26:43.771
[Elden]
What does that mean?

26:43.880 --> 26:46.144
You know the phrase
”You’ve been telling tales--”

26:46.250 --> 26:47.547
Why don ’t you just tell me
what you mean?

26:47.650 --> 26:49.641
[Lulu barks]

26:52.730 --> 26:54.925
-I dropped the camera.
-You thought this was evidence?

26:56.980 --> 26:59.278
It shows Elden with
Sam and Nathan.

26:59.380 --> 27:00.756
The night he was killed.

27:00.860 --> 27:02.851
[panﬁng]

27:07.910 --> 27:09.969
The dog surprised me...

27:10.070 --> 27:12.061
Fucking hell.

27:12.630 --> 27:14.621
[splashing]

27:27.690 --> 27:29.681
[exhales]

27:30.330 --> 27:32.025
[rummaging]

27:32.130 --> 27:34.121
Where the fuck is my...

27:36.890 --> 27:39.734
-That guy is an asshole.
-No. No.

27:40.780 --> 27:42.771
He's a traitor.

27:43.660 --> 27:44.831
You're an asshole.

27:44.940 --> 27:47.113
What did I do?

27:47.220 --> 27:49.222
Nothing, Nathan. You just...

27:49.910 --> 27:51.764
You're not a very
likable person.

27:51.870 --> 27:52.882
It's not your fault.

27:52.990 --> 27:57.324
Well, maybe I wouldn't have
to be such an asshole if

27:57.430 --> 27:59.091
you had opened your mouth.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.771
We all don't get the same
enjoyment out of threatening
people as you do.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.871
That was not a threat.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.722
You know what? He's right.

28:08.090 --> 28:10.502
He's right about you.

28:10.610 --> 28:14.125
You're just playing soldier,
but a real soldier has to
get some on him.

28:15.290 --> 28:16.826
See, I remember there
was a time

28:16.930 --> 28:20.798
when you would not
have been able to do that

28:20.900 --> 28:22.197
to one of our own people.

28:22.300 --> 28:24.291
He's not one of my people
anymore.

28:26.340 --> 28:29.400
He looked you in the eyes,
and he lied to you

28:29.510 --> 28:32.502
after you told him that
it put your family at risk.

28:33.270 --> 28:35.261
That's not a friend.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.911
I'll tell you what.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.649
It's your call.

28:43.760 --> 28:48.447
If you want Elden to live
and to walk away from
everything that we've done,

28:49.650 --> 28:51.641
fine.

28:57.490 --> 28:59.492
That's what I thought.

29:07.940 --> 29:09.942
Pick him up.

29:50.070 --> 29:53.062
I'm sorry I didn't believe you
before when you said you saw
Uncle Joe.

29:54.670 --> 29:57.764
I honestly just thought
you had a bad dream.

29:57.870 --> 29:59.872
I'm so sorry you had
to go through that, Jude.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.751
We should leave this house.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.017
Why?

30:06.120 --> 30:08.099
Then Uncle Joe won't know
where we are.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.202
Hey.

30:10.690 --> 30:12.180
Uncle Joe isn't
tryIng to get us.

30:12.290 --> 30:13.905
Then why is he here?

30:14.010 --> 30:16.001
I don't know.

30:18.370 --> 30:20.372
Something else happened,
Mommy.

30:22.660 --> 30:23.911
What?

30:24.020 --> 30:27.535
-Dad and I were
watching TV and...
-Mmm-mmm.

30:31.710 --> 30:33.484
What's that?

30:33.590 --> 30:35.581
I don't know.

30:38.270 --> 30:40.158
It's a storage card.

30:40.270 --> 30:42.272
How did it get in that box?

30:42.800 --> 30:44.791
Iris must have put it in there.

30:54.970 --> 30:56.062
[clicks key]

30:56.170 --> 30:58.161
[Nathan ]
I 7/ tell you what.

30:58.970 --> 31:01.029
It’s your call.

31:01.140 --> 31:04.871
If you want Elden to live

31:04.980 --> 31:09.292
and walk away from everything
that we ’ve done, fine.

31:16.550 --> 31:18.541
Thats what] thought.

31:20.350 --> 31:22.352
Pick him up.

31:40.530 --> 31:42.873
[Gareth]
Bien venidos, am/go.

31:42.980 --> 31:45.437
You did not sound good
on the phone.

31:45.540 --> 31:47.235
-I feel anxious.
-Ha!

31:47.340 --> 31:49.228
Things aren't working out
they way that they--

31:49.340 --> 31:52.400
-You know, I-I'm nervous.
-Come on in.

31:52.510 --> 31:54.501
[Gareth] Let's have a beverage.

31:56.150 --> 31:58.141
-You want another?
-[gags] No.

32:02.160 --> 32:04.572
Nathan, you look stressed.

32:04.680 --> 32:07.092
I think I know why though.
We've put a lot on
your shoulders.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.998
But, you have handled it
beautifully.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.162
[pouring]

32:14.970 --> 32:16.961
That's not the real reason
I came here.

32:17.330 --> 32:18.661
No?

32:18.770 --> 32:20.101
Why did you come here?

32:20.210 --> 32:21.859
-[Ginny] Hey, babe.
-Who's that?

32:21.970 --> 32:24.996
That is Ginny.
She's my new girl. Yeah, babe!

32:25.100 --> 32:26.078
You hungry?

32:26.180 --> 32:28.114
Uh... You hungry, Nathan?

32:28.220 --> 32:30.211
-No,no.
-You sure?

32:31.820 --> 32:34.084
No, we're good. Thanks.

32:35.710 --> 32:38.508
Nathan, from work is here.
You should come in and say hey.

32:40.910 --> 32:42.047
-Hey.
-[Nathan] Hey.

32:42.150 --> 32:43.378
[Gareth] Hey!

32:43.480 --> 32:45.129
You guys don't want to eat?

32:45.240 --> 32:46.650
-You wanna eat?
-Um, no.

32:46.760 --> 32:48.751
No? No, we're good, babe.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.271
-Thank you.
-[Ginny] Mmm-hmm.

32:53.170 --> 32:54.740
I think I know why
you're really here.

32:54.850 --> 32:56.260
-You do?
-Yeah.

32:56.370 --> 32:58.179
-The stock trades?
-What?

32:58.290 --> 33:00.508
[Ginny] Where're the leftovers
from Mastro's?

33:00.610 --> 33:02.623
Uh, I don't know, babe.

33:04.580 --> 33:06.309
-I want-- No, no, no, no.
-[Ginny] Where are they?

33:06.420 --> 33:08.479
[Gareth] I think you and Sheila

33:08.580 --> 33:10.275
-ate them all last night.
-I don't want--

33:10.380 --> 33:12.189
-I don't want any money.
-[Ginny] Oh, no.

33:12.300 --> 33:15.087
It's okay. I don't care.
It doesn't matter.

33:15.190 --> 33:18.205
Okay? 'Cause I already
set up an account for you
in the Caymans.

33:18.310 --> 33:20.483
You know, I take care
of my own, pal.

33:20.590 --> 33:22.205
Oh, you know
what you should do?

33:22.310 --> 33:25.768
You should take my plane
and go down to the Caymans

33:25.880 --> 33:29.134
and you should sit there,
count your money, eat all
the pussy you possibly can,

33:29.240 --> 33:30.650
and empty your balls
for a few weeks.

33:30.760 --> 33:34.548
Did you say that you put
money in a bank account for me?

33:34.650 --> 33:36.902
Yeah, I did. You deserve it.

33:37.010 --> 33:39.023
Come on, none of this would
have happened without you.

33:39.130 --> 33:41.542
[Ginny] Yeah, you're totally
right, we ate that shit
last night.

33:41.650 --> 33:43.140
[Gareth chuckles] I told you!

33:43.250 --> 33:46.037
[Ginny] I'm gonna go pick
something up.
[Gareth] All right.

33:46.140 --> 33:48.153
-[Nathan exhales]
-[Gareth grunts]

33:48.260 --> 33:49.875
-[door opens]
-What do you think?

33:49.980 --> 33:50.958
[door closes]

33:51.060 --> 33:53.654
She is smoking hot, huh?

33:54.630 --> 33:57.098
I think that greed

33:58.070 --> 34:00.129
is an addiction,

34:00.230 --> 34:02.221
-just like booze, drugs,
anything else.
-[cocks gun]

34:05.120 --> 34:06.371
What the fuck is that?

34:06.480 --> 34:08.050
You showed a promotional video

34:08.160 --> 34:10.970
-of our weapon at the Pentagon?
-Relax, Nathan.

34:11.080 --> 34:13.731
Okay? That was
the plan all along.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.820
Volaris was developed
with a legitimate application
in mind

34:16.930 --> 34:18.340
from the very beginning--

34:18.450 --> 34:22.898
As an ostensible application
in case someone came
snooping around.

34:23.010 --> 34:24.671
Okay, you have to calm down.

34:24.780 --> 34:27.556
'Cause I can't think when
you have that thing pointed
in my face, all right?

34:27.660 --> 34:31.152
And you, obviously, are not
thinking at all. Did you
seriously come here

34:31.260 --> 34:32.670
to kill me?

34:32.780 --> 34:34.350
And how did you think you were
going to get away with that?

34:34.460 --> 34:36.860
-Make it look like a suicide.
-A suicide?

34:37.550 --> 34:39.279
[laughs heartily]

34:39.390 --> 34:43.121
-Why are you laughing at me?
-I'm sorry. It's just...

34:43.230 --> 34:45.232
Do you know how ridiculous
that sounds?

34:46.080 --> 34:47.297
I mean, last night,

34:47.400 --> 34:50.130
I smoked a joint and Ginny ate
my asshole,

34:50.240 --> 34:53.368
while her best
friend sucked my cock
for two hours.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.823
Do you know
how that feels, Nathan?

34:55.930 --> 35:00.947
I mean, who in their right mind
would think that I would want
to kill myself, okay?

35:01.050 --> 35:05.020
And, I mean, not to state
the obvious, but you've been
on camera since you got here.

35:05.130 --> 35:08.793
I realized that when
I got here, and that's also
when I realized

35:08.900 --> 35:10.993
that this wasn't a suicide
after all.

35:11.100 --> 35:13.034
Good. So put the gun down,

35:13.140 --> 35:14.198
okay? Hey!

35:14.300 --> 35:15.767
-[door closes]
-Wait a minute.

35:15.870 --> 35:17.724
Hey, babe, my car isn't
charged. Can I borrow your--
[965%]

35:17.830 --> 35:19.286
-What're you doing here?
-What's he doing?

35:19.390 --> 35:23.247
-Just stay still. Stay still!
-Nathan, why don't you
tell her--

35:23.350 --> 35:25.523
-I'm sorry.
-Tell her what you're doing.

35:25.630 --> 35:27.211
[Nathan confused] I--

35:27.320 --> 35:29.652
Yeah, I don't think
you were part of his plan.

35:29.760 --> 35:34.151
-Gareth, what the fuck?
-It's okay. It's just a little
misunderstanding we have here.

35:36.730 --> 35:38.345
Yeah, I can. I can just leave.

35:38.450 --> 35:40.441
Give her the car keys.

35:42.010 --> 35:44.740
So, Ginny...

35:44.850 --> 35:49.469
Nathan and I, have been helping
the CIA to release
a plague Virus

35:49.580 --> 35:51.309
on the Muslim world,
and trying to make it look like

35:51.420 --> 35:54.309
the terrorists accidentally
did it to themselves.

35:54.420 --> 35:57.127
-What are you going to do now?
-Why the hell did you
just do that?

35:57.230 --> 35:59.221
-Why the fuck would
you tell me that?
-Shut the fuck up.

36:02.470 --> 36:04.244
It's your move, Nathan.

36:04.350 --> 36:06.341
[shot fired]

36:08.840 --> 36:12.332
Do you want to sit down,
or uh...

36:12.440 --> 36:14.135
Anything on your mind
you want to talk about?

36:14.240 --> 36:15.650
You wanna...

36:15.760 --> 36:18.308
I'm not very, um...

36:18.410 --> 36:20.469
I just never done this
before so...

36:20.570 --> 36:22.561
All right. Nathan...
[presses button]

36:24.130 --> 36:26.951
See that?
I hit the panic button.

36:27.060 --> 36:29.233
Okay? That means

36:29.340 --> 36:31.672
the cops are going to be here
any fucking minute.

36:31.780 --> 36:36.228
And you are fucked,
and you have no play here, but

36:36.340 --> 36:39.628
you haven't passed the point
of no return yet,
Nathan, okay?

36:41.350 --> 36:42.362
I can fix that.

36:42.470 --> 36:45.030
You don't know what
my next play is.

36:45.830 --> 36:47.411
Because

36:47.520 --> 36:49.511
a man like you

36:49.840 --> 36:51.831
could not conceive

36:52.360 --> 36:54.817
of putting a cause
before his own life.

36:54.920 --> 36:57.377
You are a fucking fanatic

36:57.480 --> 36:59.380
just like the ones
we're fighting against.

36:59.490 --> 37:01.629
You wanna be a soldier,

37:01.730 --> 37:03.425
you gotta get some on you.

37:03.530 --> 37:06.567

a fucking zero--

-What the fuck
are you domg here?
-Listen to me, Paul,

39:17.020 --> 39:20.069
I didn't kill anyone, okay?
I'm just trying to stay alive.

39:20.180 --> 39:21.886
But, I, I need some help.

I need to talk to Janice,

to talk to Caleb.

You're wasting your time, man.
Janice isn't with Caleb
anymore.

Janice gets home,

39:30.190 --> 39:31.691

with her, okay?

You need to get the fuck
out of my house, right now.

I'm not armed,
and I'm not looking for
a fucking fight.

40:43.590 --> 40:45.581
[Bob] Clear the room.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.711
[door opens and closes]

41:03.330 --> 41:05.321
[speaking Arabic]

41:12.700 --> 41:14.975
[speaking Arabic]

43:32.470 --> 43:34.586
[Abu-Saeed raising his voice]

43:42.640 --> 43:46.246
[Joe]
If I ’m right;
it would all have to point
back to a patient zero.

43:48.410 --> 43:51.561
[Abu-Saeed coughing]

44:06.470 --> 44:07.801
[line ringing]

44:07.910 --> 44:09.901
[Chloe] Daddy, I love them.

44:10.670 --> 44:12.729
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

44:12.830 --> 44:14.923
[Nathan ]
You ’re welcome.

44:15.030 --> 44:19.171
Chloe, I ’m going to have
to go away for work
for a wh/le.

44:19.280 --> 44:22.818
I'm likely gonna have
to change my name and,

44:22.920 --> 44:24.911
I would be, like,
undercover and

44:27.130 --> 44:29.223
I might not see you.

44:29.330 --> 44:30.627
But,

44:30.730 --> 44:33.381
it's for the greater good.
Do you know what that is?

44:33.490 --> 44:37.597
It's when you do something
good that's for

44:37.700 --> 44:41.431
everyone else,
but not necessar/ly

44:41.540 --> 44:44.612
for yourself or the people
who you love most.

44:45.940 --> 44:47.760
Listen,

44:47.870 --> 44:51.840
they're gonna probably make
some kind of public explanation
about where I went,

44:51.950 --> 44:54.805
and when I ’rn gone,
people might say things
about me that

44:54.910 --> 44:56.320
just aren ’t true.

44:56.430 --> 44:57.852
What kind of things?

44:57.960 --> 44:59.951
Well, like things, just...

45:01.160 --> 45:03.936
It's just not true.

45:04.040 --> 45:07.203
I have to go now,
and I want you to know that

45:08.050 --> 45:09.460
I love you.

45:09.570 --> 45:11.561
I love you too, Daddy.

45:17.820 --> 45:19.811
[police sirens wailing
in the distance]

45:31.390 --> 45:33.381
