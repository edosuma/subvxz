01:29.161 --> 01:31.427
You're not cold
or anything, are you?

01:31.429 --> 01:33.429
Everything all right?

01:33.431 --> 01:35.464
Are you taking any medication?

01:35.466 --> 01:37.535
Hmm?

01:38.804 --> 01:40.070
Thank you.

01:40.072 --> 01:41.705
How are you doing this morning?

01:41.707 --> 01:43.940
Did you have a restful sleep
last night?

01:43.942 --> 01:45.475
Oh, yeah.

01:45.477 --> 01:46.610
- You did?
- I did.

01:46.612 --> 01:48.445
- Any dreams?
- Nope.

01:48.447 --> 01:49.980
Sometimes we don't
remember our dreams, you know?

01:49.982 --> 01:50.981
That's right.

01:50.983 --> 01:52.849
We do dream,
but we don't remember

01:52.851 --> 01:54.684
- when we wake up.
- No.

01:54.686 --> 01:56.519
But if we are dreaming some

01:56.521 --> 01:58.688
just before we wake up,
we remember those.

01:58.690 --> 01:59.823
That's right.

01:59.825 --> 02:01.225
Did you know...

02:01.227 --> 02:03.760
A little, uh...
uh, useful information.

02:05.497 --> 02:07.098
- Yeah.
- When we wake up

02:07.100 --> 02:08.765
and say, "The whole night,

02:08.768 --> 02:10.567
I was dreaming
this and that and everything,"

02:10.568 --> 02:12.169
it's only 45 minutes maximum.

02:12.171 --> 02:15.239
- Did you know that?
- Yeah. No, I did not. Yeah.

02:15.241 --> 02:18.175
So the ordinary dream
is ten or 15 minutes.

02:18.177 --> 02:19.944
I'll see you all later.

02:19.946 --> 02:22.480
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to see my patients.

02:22.482 --> 02:23.748
Testing. Testing.

02:23.750 --> 02:25.116
Check, check, check.
One, two, three.

02:25.118 --> 02:26.717
Testing. One, two, three.

02:26.719 --> 02:29.887
We are now at Smith's Grove,

02:29.889 --> 02:31.990
uh, rehabilitation facility.

02:31.992 --> 02:34.026
We're here today
to interview a patient

02:34.028 --> 02:38.196
that's spent the last 40 years
in captivity

02:38.198 --> 02:41.667
and, by all accounts,
has not uttered a word.

02:41.669 --> 02:42.701
This monster...

02:48.642 --> 02:50.142
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

02:50.144 --> 02:51.643
I'm Dr. Ranbir Sartain.

02:51.645 --> 02:53.111
Great to finally meet you.

02:53.113 --> 02:55.981
Thank you so much for taking
the time to meet with us today.

02:55.983 --> 02:57.683
We were hoping to have
this opportunity

02:57.685 --> 02:59.918
before he's transferred
to the new facility.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.920
Glass Hill
is far less accommodating.

03:01.922 --> 03:03.822
Glass Hill is the pit of hell.

03:03.824 --> 03:06.558
For years, he's been kept here
to be studied.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.593
I suppose the state
has lost interest

03:08.595 --> 03:09.896
in discovering
anything further.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.799
Well, that's why we're here.

03:12.801 --> 03:14.567
Michael has been
my life's obsession.

03:14.569 --> 03:17.570
I've examined every single
case file written on him.

03:17.572 --> 03:20.840
I was a student of Dr. Loomis
before he passed away.

03:20.842 --> 03:23.042
And then I lobbied
the University of Illinois

03:23.044 --> 03:25.578
to be assigned
to Michael myself.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.046
Any progress?

03:27.048 --> 03:30.583
Well, he's been seen by
over 50 clinical psychiatrists,

03:30.585 --> 03:32.987
and with each,
many different opinions.

03:32.989 --> 03:36.056
Dr. Loomis was the only one
to see him in the wild.

03:36.058 --> 03:38.993
And he concluded he was
nothing more than pure evil.

03:38.995 --> 03:42.062
Our patients get fresh air,
sunshine,

03:42.064 --> 03:46.600
a view, proper exercise,
healthy diet.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.736
It pains me
to see him transferred

03:48.738 --> 03:52.606
to that less-than-desirable
facility.

03:52.608 --> 03:54.744
And there he is.

03:55.678 --> 03:57.144
He can speak.

03:57.146 --> 03:58.879
He just chooses not to.

03:58.881 --> 04:02.016
I'd love to stand
closer to him, if I may.

04:02.018 --> 04:05.020
Get a sense of his awareness,
or lack of awareness.

04:05.022 --> 04:08.156
Oh, make no mistake,
he's aware.

04:08.158 --> 04:10.258
He was watching you
as you arrived.

04:10.260 --> 04:14.162
Perhaps you'd like to tie
your left shoelace?

04:14.164 --> 04:17.932
Mr. Tovoli here, the gentleman
with the umbrella,

04:17.934 --> 04:20.201
has a fixation for such things.

04:20.202 --> 04:22.070
Underestimate no one.

04:22.072 --> 04:23.140
Of course.

04:25.042 --> 04:28.246
And now step up
to the yellow line.

04:29.646 --> 04:31.780
And no further.

04:31.782 --> 04:34.985
Do not cross the line
under any circumstances.

04:36.686 --> 04:38.222
Michael.

04:39.623 --> 04:41.323
Michael.

04:41.325 --> 04:44.929
I've got some people
who'd like to meet you.

04:47.265 --> 04:49.200
Hello, Michael.

04:51.335 --> 04:53.803
My name is Aaron Korey.

04:53.805 --> 04:55.938
I've been following your case
for years

04:55.940 --> 04:59.309
and still know
very little about you.

04:59.311 --> 05:01.246
I'd like to know more.

05:02.680 --> 05:04.682
About that night.

05:05.683 --> 05:08.220
About those involved.

05:10.688 --> 05:13.423
Do you ever think about them,
Michael?

05:13.425 --> 05:16.261
Feel guilt about their fate?

05:32.111 --> 05:33.910
I borrowed something
from a friend

05:33.912 --> 05:36.216
at the attorney general's
office, Michael.

05:57.036 --> 05:59.839
You feel it,
don't you, Michael?

06:04.411 --> 06:07.446
You feel the mask.

06:07.448 --> 06:10.848
Figaro. Figaro!

06:16.790 --> 06:18.190
Say something, Michael.

06:19.927 --> 06:21.460
Say something.

06:32.474 --> 06:34.474
You can feel it, can't you?

06:34.476 --> 06:37.510
It's a part of you, Michael.

06:39.947 --> 06:41.080
It's a part of you.

06:43.418 --> 06:44.750
Say something.

06:45.987 --> 06:47.453
Say something, Michael.

07:01.803 --> 07:02.802
Say something!

08:44.243 --> 08:46.276
<i>What is it we're after?</i>

08:46.278 --> 08:48.345
<i>Okay, well,</i>

08:48.347 --> 08:52.182
having witnessed the animal
in its captive state

08:52.184 --> 08:54.451
and failed to provoke
any sort of response,

08:54.453 --> 08:58.188
we now track down
its counterpart.

08:58.190 --> 09:02.460
Could it be that one monster
has created another?

09:02.462 --> 09:05.195
And although the iron bars
and barbed wire

09:05.197 --> 09:08.433
that separate them
are both strong and sharp,

09:08.435 --> 09:10.635
the metaphysical lines
are blurred and slight.

09:10.637 --> 09:15.306
Both exist in isolation,
fettered by their own fear

09:15.308 --> 09:17.141
- and hatred of one another.
- This one.

09:17.143 --> 09:18.176
Here?

09:18.178 --> 09:20.545
Could it be that the only hope

09:20.547 --> 09:23.247
- of rehabilitation...
- Spooky.

09:23.249 --> 09:24.949
...is through confrontation?

09:24.951 --> 09:26.451
"Access has been denied.

09:26.453 --> 09:28.620
Private property. No trespassing."

09:28.622 --> 09:30.490
You might need this.

09:36.363 --> 09:40.265
Dana, journalists don't pay
for their interviews.

09:40.267 --> 09:41.533
Smile.

09:41.535 --> 09:43.537
We're on camera.

09:50.678 --> 09:52.945
Yes.

09:52.947 --> 09:56.250
Hello. Um, we're looking
for Laurie Strode.

10:02.189 --> 10:04.223
We're, uh, um...

10:04.225 --> 10:07.226
we're-we're making a podcast,
and, uh...

10:07.228 --> 10:09.364
We're investigative
journalists.

10:10.665 --> 10:14.536
If you have a moment,
we've traveled a very long way.

10:16.238 --> 10:19.274
How does $3,000 sound?

11:10.126 --> 11:12.061
Hello.

11:14.498 --> 11:16.063
May we come in?

11:16.065 --> 11:18.335
And-and sit down and talk?

11:29.546 --> 11:31.079
So...

11:31.081 --> 11:33.548
Aaron and I have made several

11:33.550 --> 11:36.719
award-winning
public radio exposÃ©s.

11:36.721 --> 11:38.286
Our last project shed new light

11:38.288 --> 11:40.055
on a murder case
from 20 years ago.

11:40.057 --> 11:45.361
We like to reexamine incidents
with an unbiased lens.

11:45.363 --> 11:47.196
I believe there's
a lot to learn

11:47.198 --> 11:48.666
from the horrors
you experienced.

11:49.801 --> 11:51.767
There's nothing to learn.

11:51.769 --> 11:54.770
There are no new insights

11:54.772 --> 11:57.408
or discoveries.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.109
So, is he real?

12:00.111 --> 12:01.711
Who?

12:01.713 --> 12:03.814
The Boogeyman.

12:03.816 --> 12:05.381
I read you quoted...

12:05.383 --> 12:06.617
You don't believe
in the Boogeyman?

12:06.619 --> 12:13.289
I believe in Michael Myers,
deranged serial killer, but...

12:13.291 --> 12:15.528
the Boogeyman, no.

12:17.363 --> 12:19.698
Well, you should.

12:20.866 --> 12:22.733
Okay.

12:22.735 --> 12:24.768
Michael Myers is a human being

12:24.770 --> 12:27.871
who killed his sister
when he was six years old.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.575
Then he came after you.

12:30.509 --> 12:32.676
We just want to know why.

12:32.678 --> 12:34.578
We want a glimpse
inside his mind.

12:34.580 --> 12:38.148
That's why your story
is so important.

12:38.150 --> 12:40.152
My story?

12:41.153 --> 12:42.687
Two failed marriages.

12:42.689 --> 12:46.624
Rocky relationship with your
daughter and granddaughter.

12:46.626 --> 12:50.697
Michael Myers
murdered five people.

12:52.165 --> 12:55.433
And he's a human being
we need to understand?

12:55.435 --> 12:57.702
I'm twice divorced.

12:57.704 --> 12:59.673
And I'm a basket case.

13:03.343 --> 13:05.209
They're transferring him.

13:05.211 --> 13:07.612
Tomorrow, 7:00.

13:07.614 --> 13:09.815
He'll-he'll be locked away
until the end of his days.

13:09.817 --> 13:11.552
That's the idea.

13:13.588 --> 13:16.154
Let's talk about
when the state came

13:16.156 --> 13:17.723
to take your daughter away.

13:17.725 --> 13:19.458
She was 12 years old.

13:19.460 --> 13:21.760
They said you were
an unfit mother.

13:21.762 --> 13:24.599
How long until
you regained custody?

13:28.169 --> 13:29.835
I didn't.

13:29.837 --> 13:32.773
But you already knew that.

13:34.408 --> 13:36.408
Laurie, we saw him.

13:36.410 --> 13:38.812
We met with Michael.

13:38.814 --> 13:41.246
I showed him the mask.

13:41.248 --> 13:43.215
There was nothing.

13:43.217 --> 13:45.952
No response. Nothing.

13:45.954 --> 13:47.921
He won't talk to anyone.

13:47.923 --> 13:50.423
Never has, but...

13:50.425 --> 13:53.493
I think he might speak
with you.

13:53.495 --> 13:56.229
So, why don't you sit down
with him

13:56.231 --> 14:01.768
and say all the things
you must be longing to say.

14:01.770 --> 14:04.237
Come with us,

14:04.239 --> 14:07.409
and let us help you
free yourself.

14:08.510 --> 14:09.846
Please.

14:16.318 --> 14:17.854
Time's up.

14:20.490 --> 14:22.525
I'll accept my payment.

14:25.995 --> 14:27.864
Get out.

14:29.232 --> 14:31.399
You want to shit under my sink?

14:31.401 --> 14:33.969
I will murder you
and your whole family.

14:36.439 --> 14:38.740
I switched from marshmallow
fluff to peanut butter.

14:38.742 --> 14:41.542
See if those little bastards
eat that.

14:41.544 --> 14:43.310
- That ought to kill them.
- Morning.

14:43.312 --> 14:45.947
I rescheduled my last session,
so I can make it tonight.

14:45.949 --> 14:47.516
You really didn't
have to do that, Mom.

14:47.518 --> 14:48.917
It's not a big deal.

14:48.919 --> 14:50.552
You made it into
the National Honor Society.

14:50.554 --> 14:51.887
- Yeah.
- That is a very big deal.

14:51.889 --> 14:53.922
I just made it to the top
of my shop class,

14:53.924 --> 14:57.959
making birdhouses and, uh,
a checkerboard made of teak.

14:57.961 --> 15:00.829
We're excited to meet Cameron.

15:00.831 --> 15:02.965
That whole family, though,
they had a reputation.

15:02.967 --> 15:04.733
- Ray, come on.
- But it's true.

15:04.735 --> 15:06.401
- It's a relevant factor.
- Ray.

15:06.403 --> 15:08.004
- Ray.
- Do you remember the one time Lonnie

15:08.006 --> 15:09.038
punched that cop in the face?

15:09.040 --> 15:10.338
- Ray.
- That was a...

15:10.340 --> 15:11.841
Oh! Mother...

15:11.843 --> 15:13.609
Oh, man!

15:13.611 --> 15:15.611
I got peanut butter
on my penis.

15:15.613 --> 15:17.046
Ew, Dad.

15:17.048 --> 15:18.548
Instant karma.

15:18.550 --> 15:20.450
Cameron is a good guy.
He's nothing like that.

15:20.452 --> 15:22.051
You're gonna see
when you meet him tonight.

15:22.053 --> 15:25.621
They're all nice guys
until they get you pregnant,

15:25.623 --> 15:27.924
and then you gotta drive
in their pickup trucks,

15:27.926 --> 15:29.892
and you clean their guns,
and you got children,

15:29.894 --> 15:32.595
and you clean guns, and you
like to get high with them,

15:32.597 --> 15:33.863
and then y'all get fat.

15:33.865 --> 15:34.965
Hey, Dad?

15:34.967 --> 15:36.466
- What?
- Can you stop?

15:36.468 --> 15:39.437
I gotta clean
this peanut butter off my hand.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.681
Did you invite Grandmother
like you said you would?

15:50.549 --> 15:53.383
About tonight.
You said that you'd...

15:53.385 --> 15:54.952
- Oh.
- ...invite her.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.354
Right. I did.

15:57.356 --> 15:58.989
- You did?
- Yeah.

15:58.991 --> 16:00.657
I talked to her yesterday.

16:00.659 --> 16:02.860
She's not gonna be able
to come, honey. I'm sorry.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.062
Really?

16:04.064 --> 16:05.896
Yeah.

16:05.898 --> 16:08.398
Baby, she's agoraphobic.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.835
She needs cognitive
behavioral therapy,

16:10.837 --> 16:13.037
so don't take it personally.

16:13.039 --> 16:14.975
That's Vicky. I gotta go.

16:17.376 --> 16:18.777
Hey, I love you.

16:18.779 --> 16:21.513
Have a good day.

16:21.515 --> 16:22.914
- Bye, Dad. Love you.
- Okay.

16:22.916 --> 16:24.582
<i>So, my mom's a liar.</i>

16:24.584 --> 16:26.484
<i>What happened?</i>

16:26.486 --> 16:27.852
She said that she invited

16:27.854 --> 16:29.754
my grandmother tonight,
but she didn't.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.556
I mean, she never even
contacted her.

16:31.558 --> 16:34.093
- How do you know?
- Because I called her myself.

16:34.095 --> 16:35.860
- That's bullshit.
- Yeah.

16:35.862 --> 16:38.931
Dude, what's your mom's deal?
Why would she say that?

16:38.933 --> 16:42.400
I don't know. She just tries
to keep me away from her.

16:42.402 --> 16:43.701
Everyone in my family, like,

16:43.703 --> 16:46.872
turns into a total nutcase
this time of year.

16:46.874 --> 16:48.941
If I were you guys,
I wouldn't celebrate, either.

16:48.943 --> 16:51.644
I would just put up
a Christmas tree instead.

16:51.646 --> 16:54.547
Just skip all over the
creepy Halloween shit, right?

16:54.549 --> 16:56.916
Does your grandma
ever talk about it?

16:56.918 --> 16:59.084
Yeah, it's pretty much
all she talks about.

16:59.086 --> 17:01.453
It defines her life.

17:01.455 --> 17:03.422
She's been traumatized
ever since.

17:03.424 --> 17:05.523
Wasn't it her brother
who, like,

17:05.526 --> 17:07.127
cold-blooded murdilated
all those teenagers?

17:07.128 --> 17:08.560
No.

17:08.563 --> 17:10.529
That's just a bit
that some people made up

17:10.531 --> 17:11.964
to make them feel better,
I think.

17:11.967 --> 17:14.633
I mean, that is scary to have
a bunch of your friends

17:14.635 --> 17:15.969
get butchered
by some random crazy person.

17:15.971 --> 17:18.137
Is it, though?
Because, all things considered,

17:18.140 --> 17:20.740
there's a lot worse stuff
that's happening today.

17:20.742 --> 17:23.175
And, like, I mean, what,
a couple people getting killed

17:23.178 --> 17:26.079
by one guy with a knife
is not that big of a deal.

17:26.080 --> 17:28.548
Dude, her grandmother
was almost fucking murdered.

17:28.550 --> 17:31.518
And she escaped,
and they caught him,

17:31.520 --> 17:33.119
and now he's incarcerated.

17:33.121 --> 17:36.489
I-I'm just saying, like,
by today's standards...

17:36.491 --> 17:38.092
Just shut the fuck up, Dave.

17:38.094 --> 17:39.626
Shut up.

17:39.628 --> 17:41.095
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, shut up, Dave.

17:41.097 --> 17:42.596
Hey, is it cool with you guys

17:42.598 --> 17:44.165
if I explode one
of these pumpkin heads?

17:45.168 --> 17:46.167
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Go for it.

17:46.169 --> 17:47.869
Oh, he's serious?

17:47.871 --> 17:49.804
- He's serious.
- Oh, God, he's really blowing it up.

17:49.806 --> 17:51.806
I know.
He's such a fucking moron.

17:51.808 --> 17:52.974
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Oh, Jesus.

17:52.976 --> 17:55.042
Go, go, go, go, go.

17:55.044 --> 17:56.978
Happy Halloween!

17:56.980 --> 17:59.046
Ah!

17:59.048 --> 18:00.481
Cameron.

18:00.483 --> 18:02.116
I got you.
That was a good one.

18:02.118 --> 18:03.484
Yes, that was very good.

18:03.486 --> 18:04.719
Hey, do you have everything

18:04.721 --> 18:06.221
for your costume
tomorrow night?

18:06.223 --> 18:08.890
- Bonnie and Clyde must roll as one, after all.
- Um...

18:08.892 --> 18:12.094
no, I mean,
I-I'm more focused on tonight.

18:12.096 --> 18:13.661
Tonight?

18:13.663 --> 18:15.496
I-I thought you were joking
when you said

18:15.498 --> 18:17.833
your parents
were old-fashioned.

18:17.835 --> 18:19.167
- Be nice, okay?
- Okay.

18:19.169 --> 18:20.769
It'll be fun.

18:20.771 --> 18:22.704
- I'm excited for tonight.
- I need to calm down.

18:22.706 --> 18:25.908
- I'm excited for tonight, okay?
- Okay.

18:25.910 --> 18:27.809
Ooh...

18:27.811 --> 18:30.679
Ugh. You guys are just barf,
you know.

18:30.681 --> 18:32.481
You're just...
you're two yucky dumpsters,

18:32.483 --> 18:34.783
- and I want to go diving. Come here. Mwah!
- No.

18:34.785 --> 18:35.751
- Dude, dude.
- Right here, right here, right?

18:35.753 --> 18:37.486
- Oh. Mwah, mwah.
- Dude, you-you got

18:37.488 --> 18:39.155
your little chapped-lip
crusties

18:39.157 --> 18:40.622
all over me, man, so thanks.

18:40.624 --> 18:42.091
I know. And you're welcome.

18:42.093 --> 18:44.227
- It's gross.
- It's a little part of me for you.

18:44.229 --> 18:45.661
For the rest of your day.

18:45.663 --> 18:46.996
All right? So, do you have

18:46.998 --> 18:48.666
everything ready
for your costume tomorrow?

18:49.667 --> 18:52.737
- Um... about that...
- What?

18:53.772 --> 18:55.504
Are we seriously not?

18:55.506 --> 18:57.840
You said we were gonna do this
whole Halloween dance together.

18:57.842 --> 18:59.909
Now-now you just...
you ditch me.

18:59.911 --> 19:01.244
I mean, you just...
you-you can't walk

19:01.246 --> 19:02.946
- all over town breaking hearts.
- Okay, okay, okay.

19:02.948 --> 19:04.080
- Hey, listen, listen.
- All right?

19:04.082 --> 19:05.949
- Love. Truly.
- Okay, lovebirds, later.

19:08.019 --> 19:10.553
Now let's open our books to...

19:10.555 --> 19:13.690
Frankl's interpretation.

19:13.692 --> 19:18.561
He said,
"Fate took a different course.

19:18.563 --> 19:22.800
"I understand how someone who
has nothing left in this world

19:22.802 --> 19:25.636
may still know bliss."

19:25.638 --> 19:28.105
His message is totally hopeful.

19:28.107 --> 19:31.809
Even in the most disparaging
of conditions,

19:31.811 --> 19:33.644
life can find its meaning,

19:33.646 --> 19:36.281
and conversely,
so can one's suffering.

19:36.283 --> 19:38.249
I...

19:38.251 --> 19:40.185
can't accept this.

19:40.187 --> 19:42.989
Use it for whatever
your heart desires.

19:44.657 --> 19:46.257
I'll save it for college, then.

19:46.259 --> 19:47.758
Fuck college.

19:47.760 --> 19:50.829
Go somewhere. Go to Mexico.

19:50.831 --> 19:52.297
Could you imagine?

19:52.299 --> 19:54.701
Yeah, I can.

19:56.737 --> 20:00.741
Look, don't worry
about your mom.

20:01.708 --> 20:04.309
She will freak.

20:04.311 --> 20:06.644
But she'll get over it.

20:06.646 --> 20:08.615
Why can't you?

20:12.320 --> 20:14.686
The Boogeyman?

20:14.688 --> 20:17.289
All this hiding,
all this preparation,

20:17.291 --> 20:18.958
it was for nothing.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.193
I mean, it took priority
over your family.

20:21.195 --> 20:23.162
It cost you your family.

20:23.164 --> 20:28.136
If the way I raised your mother
means that she hates me...

20:30.038 --> 20:32.038
...but that she's prepared

20:32.040 --> 20:35.608
for the horrors of this world,
then...

20:35.610 --> 20:37.178
I can live with that.

20:40.848 --> 20:44.786
Say good-bye to Michael,
and get over it.

20:46.654 --> 20:48.121
Good-bye.

21:19.989 --> 21:21.389
Dr. Samuel Loomis,

21:21.391 --> 21:24.926
January 22, 1979.

21:24.928 --> 21:27.128
Do you wish to give
a statement regarding

21:27.130 --> 21:29.197
your former patient,
Michael Myers?

21:29.199 --> 21:32.200
My suggestion is termination.

21:32.202 --> 21:34.669
<i>Death is the only solution
for Michael.</i>

21:34.671 --> 21:36.438
A2201. Myers, Michael.

21:36.440 --> 21:38.373
- Toes in line. Keep a line.
- <i>There's nothing</i>

21:38.375 --> 21:40.942
- <i>to be gained from keeping evil alive.</i>
- Hands up!

21:40.944 --> 21:43.111
Hands up! Stand up!

21:43.113 --> 21:43.911
A22...

21:45.815 --> 21:47.815
<i>A shot of sodium thiopental</i>

21:47.817 --> 21:49.851
<i>would render him unconscious.</i>

21:49.853 --> 21:52.287
- A22...
- <i>I'll be with him to make sure</i>

21:52.289 --> 21:54.890
<i>his life is extinguished.</i>

21:54.892 --> 21:58.727
My ear on his chest
to hear for myself

21:58.729 --> 22:00.762
that his vitals
no longer function

22:00.764 --> 22:03.100
and immediately
incinerate the body.

22:05.269 --> 22:06.270
It needs to die.

22:07.405 --> 22:09.740
It needs to die!

22:25.023 --> 22:27.190
It needs to die!

22:27.192 --> 22:29.959
Keep moving. Let's go.

22:29.961 --> 22:31.861
Don't worry, Michael.

22:31.863 --> 22:34.634
I'll be by your side.

22:44.443 --> 22:46.177
Michael Myers
is still my patient

22:46.179 --> 22:48.245
until he's in
somebody else's care,

22:48.247 --> 22:52.016
so I'm seeing my duty
through till the end.

22:52.018 --> 22:54.187
All right, move out.

23:18.744 --> 23:20.412
...send my DNA away
to a stranger.

23:20.414 --> 23:22.414
Why not? You can find out
some pretty interesting things.

23:22.416 --> 23:24.082
- Don't...
- I found out that I'm part Cherokee.

23:24.084 --> 23:26.284
I guess my dad's, like,
seven percent Cherokee.

23:26.286 --> 23:28.186
I know Lonnie.
I went to high school with him.

23:28.188 --> 23:29.554
- He used to sell me peyote.
- Dad.

23:29.556 --> 23:32.190
- Everyone knows Lonnie.
- Yeah. - Dad.

23:32.192 --> 23:33.391
- I'm sorry.
- All right. Um...

23:33.393 --> 23:35.227
this is a massive overshare

23:35.229 --> 23:36.494
- for our new friend.
- No, he did.

23:36.496 --> 23:38.531
I learned a lot about myself
with his dad.

23:38.533 --> 23:40.466
- Tripped balls out in the woods, me and his dad.
- Dad.

23:40.468 --> 23:42.167
- Boy, Ray...
- Tripping balls. - Dad!

23:42.970 --> 23:44.936
No, really, keep talking.

23:44.938 --> 23:46.439
So, you guys
have big plans for tomorrow

23:46.441 --> 23:48.274
- at the high school?
- What are you doing?

23:48.276 --> 23:49.874
- Is it a dance or something?
- Yeah, it's a Halloween...

23:49.876 --> 23:50.942
- Costumes?
- Halloween dance. Yep.

23:50.944 --> 23:51.943
- Mmm!
- Costume party.

23:51.945 --> 23:53.045
What are you going as?

23:53.047 --> 23:56.115
Uh, well, I don't know
if I'm allowed to say.

23:56.117 --> 23:57.116
- Please say.
- Oh, come on.

23:57.118 --> 23:58.351
- Come on.
- I can...? Okay.

23:58.353 --> 24:00.853
Uh, so we're going
as Bonnie and Clyde.

24:00.855 --> 24:02.054
- Oh, that's a great idea.
- Yeah.

24:02.056 --> 24:03.155
- Except...
- Oh!

24:03.157 --> 24:04.123
- Oh. No.
- Ooh.

24:04.125 --> 24:05.324
Okay, so just Bonnie and Clyde.

24:05.326 --> 24:06.392
That's it. Bonnie and Clyde.

24:06.394 --> 24:07.561
Bonnie and Clyde with a twist.

24:07.563 --> 24:08.995
- Classic.
- Yeah!

24:08.997 --> 24:10.129
- Yeah! - I love that.
- Nice.

24:10.131 --> 24:11.264
- That's so fun.
- You'll see.

24:11.266 --> 24:12.499
You know how it ended, right?

24:12.501 --> 24:14.200
- Their story ended a little...
- Yes. Hopefully...

24:14.202 --> 24:15.835
Yes, with the bullets
and the bleeding.

24:15.837 --> 24:17.203
- Yeah.
- You have a jalopy

24:17.205 --> 24:19.239
filled with bullet holes
from the G-men?

24:19.241 --> 24:20.440
I wish we had one of those.

24:20.442 --> 24:22.476
- It was in Laughlin, like a Model A.
- I know.

24:22.478 --> 24:23.878
Did you talk to Grandmother?

24:25.414 --> 24:27.914
Yeah.

24:27.916 --> 24:29.549
She said she was gonna come.

24:29.551 --> 24:32.019
She came to my office.
We had a nice talk.

24:32.021 --> 24:33.320
Did you? Really?

24:33.322 --> 24:35.122
- That's a first.
- It was nice.

24:35.124 --> 24:36.556
- Oh.
- Do you know where she is, then?

24:36.558 --> 24:39.594
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I...
- That part... Oh.

24:39.596 --> 24:41.295
- Great timing, Mom. Hi.
- Uh, I...

24:41.297 --> 24:42.429
- You made it.
- It ran late. I'm sorry.

24:42.431 --> 24:44.931
- Hi. I'm so happy you came.
- Hi, Mom. - Hi, Laurie.

24:44.933 --> 24:46.567
- Hi. Hi. I'm, uh...
- Hi.

24:46.569 --> 24:48.035
I'm the grandmother.

24:48.037 --> 24:49.537
Nice to meet you.
I'm Cameron Elam.

24:49.539 --> 24:51.004
And we're here
celebrating our daughter

24:51.006 --> 24:52.540
- because of her...
- Yes, I know.

24:52.542 --> 24:54.041
How did it go?

24:54.043 --> 24:56.210
Yes. It looks good on you.

24:56.212 --> 24:58.179
You know, I was in
the Honor Society, too.

24:58.181 --> 24:59.314
That's good.
Why don't you sit down, Mom?

24:59.316 --> 25:00.315
- No, I'm good.
- Yeah, have a seat.

25:00.317 --> 25:02.050
Or we could go for a walk,
if you'd like.

25:02.052 --> 25:03.151
- Really? Did it go great? Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:03.153 --> 25:04.319
It went really...
it went, um...

25:04.321 --> 25:05.987
- Hey, Mom?
- That's mine.

25:05.989 --> 25:08.956
- I thought you quit drinking.
- Mmm.

25:08.958 --> 25:11.225
Mom, what are you doing?
What is this?

25:11.227 --> 25:14.395
You know, this is exactly
why we don't reach out.

25:14.397 --> 25:16.130
Mom.

25:16.132 --> 25:19.301
I'm sorry. I will sit down.

25:19.303 --> 25:20.168
Okay.

25:20.170 --> 25:22.371
Why don't we
press the reset button?

25:22.373 --> 25:24.906
Why don't we just
start over, okay?

25:24.908 --> 25:26.040
Mm-hmm.

25:26.042 --> 25:28.210
All right, Mom...

25:28.212 --> 25:29.611
- Sorry.
- Mom.

25:29.613 --> 25:31.449
Please stop this.

25:35.619 --> 25:38.222
Sorry.

25:39.290 --> 25:40.657
I saw him.

25:40.659 --> 25:42.124
The Shape.

25:42.126 --> 25:44.126
- Mom...
- I wanted to kill him.

25:44.128 --> 25:46.228
Okay, that's enough, Laurie.

25:46.230 --> 25:48.063
- Laurie, that's enough.
- I didn't know what to do.

25:48.065 --> 25:49.599
- That's enough, Laurie.
- Okay.

25:49.601 --> 25:52.369
I think maybe this is a little
bit too much for you, huh?

25:52.371 --> 25:54.270
Why don't we go
for a walk, all right?

25:54.272 --> 25:55.238
You said you were gonna try

25:55.240 --> 25:56.206
- to put the past behind you.
- Laurie.

25:56.208 --> 25:58.341
Okay?
Are you gonna try to do that?

25:58.343 --> 26:00.043
That's what you said
you wanted to do.

26:00.045 --> 26:01.044
I can't.

26:01.046 --> 26:02.645
Mom, look at me.

26:02.647 --> 26:04.383
Look at me.

26:07.720 --> 26:10.353
- I...
- Should we, uh...

26:10.355 --> 26:14.057
...really hate to say
I told you so, but...

26:48.060 --> 26:50.029
I'm glad you got to see that.

26:52.098 --> 26:55.400
I never told you
how I spent my childhood.

26:57.571 --> 26:59.304
Gotcha.

26:59.306 --> 27:02.174
I learned how to shoot a gun
when I was eight.

27:02.176 --> 27:04.077
I learned how to fight.

27:05.479 --> 27:08.046
I had nightmares
about the basement.

27:11.452 --> 27:15.053
Social Services came when I was
12 years old and took me away.

27:18.660 --> 27:23.161
I've spent my entire life
trying to get over the paranoia

27:23.163 --> 27:25.531
and neuroses
that she has projected on me.

27:25.533 --> 27:27.132
Yeah, he kind of reminds me

27:27.134 --> 27:28.501
of, uh, Gary Hogeboom.

27:28.503 --> 27:30.336
Yeah, that quarterback
thing is all messed up.

27:30.338 --> 27:32.474
Good times, right?

27:35.243 --> 27:37.243
What is she gonna do
with herself?

27:37.245 --> 27:39.647
I know.
It's not your job to save her.

27:42.718 --> 27:45.819
She'll be all right.

27:45.821 --> 27:48.354
I can't get reception

27:48.356 --> 27:50.056
on this thing
ever since the antenna

27:50.058 --> 27:51.224
was bent at the car wash.

27:51.226 --> 27:53.226
Why do we have
to come out again?

27:53.228 --> 27:54.495
We do this all the time.

27:54.497 --> 27:56.128
What? You don't...
you don't enjoy it?

27:56.130 --> 27:57.598
I-I like being out
in the woods and...

27:57.600 --> 28:00.634
No, I enjoy it, but I'm missing
dance class for this.

28:00.636 --> 28:02.703
And sometimes I would rather
do that than hunting.

28:02.705 --> 28:04.638
I mean, is-is-is dance class
that important to you?

28:04.640 --> 28:06.473
- Yeah, it is.
- You need some more time

28:06.475 --> 28:08.275
- in the woods to go hunting and fishing.
- No.

28:08.277 --> 28:09.610
On weekends,
I'll do it with you, Dad.

28:09.612 --> 28:11.378
Like, I really love
spending time with you,

28:11.380 --> 28:13.380
but right now dancing
is my thing, you know, and...

28:13.382 --> 28:15.215
it really hits me in the heart.
I mean, I...

28:15.217 --> 28:16.651
- Dad, look out!
- Oh!

28:20.690 --> 28:23.625
What the hell
happened to you, Hoss?

28:23.627 --> 28:25.727
Oh, shit.

28:25.729 --> 28:27.729
Dad, look.

28:27.731 --> 28:30.365
Lumpy, you stay here.

28:30.367 --> 28:32.834
I'm gonna make sure
no one's hurt.

28:32.836 --> 28:34.669
- You call the police.
- Okay.

28:34.671 --> 28:36.804
Dad, be careful, please.

28:36.806 --> 28:38.406
Hey, you fellas okay?

28:41.745 --> 28:43.280
You all right?

28:53.558 --> 28:55.356
911. What is the emergency?

28:55.358 --> 28:59.695
Yes. Um, th-there's been
an accident.

28:59.697 --> 29:01.697
Uh, there's a bus.

29:01.699 --> 29:03.432
People running around
in the road.

29:03.434 --> 29:05.734
My dad went to look.
I-I don't know.

29:05.736 --> 29:08.270
Okay. Hold on.

29:08.272 --> 29:09.838
I'll go check.

29:27.726 --> 29:29.328
Dad?

30:12.238 --> 30:14.238
Run.

30:14.240 --> 30:15.506
Wait here.

30:15.508 --> 30:17.675
I-I'll go get my dad.

30:17.677 --> 30:19.778
N-No.

30:19.780 --> 30:21.278
Run!

30:22.783 --> 30:24.551
Dad!

30:26.920 --> 30:28.352
Daddy!

30:44.805 --> 30:46.471
Don't shoot. Aah!

30:46.473 --> 30:48.607
- Oh, fuck!
- Fuck!

31:17.706 --> 31:20.375
"Don't need a credit card
to ride this train."

31:21.711 --> 31:23.844
Yo, Hawk, listen, the ball come
down loose, that's where

31:23.846 --> 31:25.879
- you're gonna mess up at.
- Yo, Hawkins, would you like

31:25.881 --> 31:27.648
a strawberry slushie
or a blue raspberry slushie?

31:27.650 --> 31:29.450
Can you just bring me
a coffee, will you?

31:29.452 --> 31:30.651
I'll get you back later.

31:30.653 --> 31:32.586
Pull a slingshot, it'll go
straight down the middle.

31:32.588 --> 31:34.321
But you ain't never gonna
beat my score,

31:34.323 --> 31:35.589
so it makes no difference
what you do.

31:35.591 --> 31:36.890
- Say that again.
- You're never gonna

31:36.892 --> 31:38.659
beat my score, so it doesn't
make no difference what you do.

31:38.661 --> 31:39.727
Dispatch to unit 601.

31:39.729 --> 31:41.695
We have a 10-50 on Marla Road.

31:41.697 --> 31:44.298
Copy that, dispatch.
I'm on my way.

31:52.675 --> 31:54.541
Attention, all units.

31:54.543 --> 31:56.010
We got an officer that's 10-23

31:56.012 --> 31:58.913
and a possible 10-50
on Route 20. Will advise.

31:58.915 --> 32:00.615
Sheriff's Department.

32:00.617 --> 32:02.817
Possible 10-98. Over.

32:02.819 --> 32:06.387
If you need assistance,
let yourself be known.

32:06.389 --> 32:08.857
Signal 13.

32:08.859 --> 32:11.361
Officer down.

32:12.329 --> 32:14.664
I repeat: officer down.

32:16.466 --> 32:18.566
I need assistance.
Send backup right away.

32:20.071 --> 32:21.636
Uh, roger that.

32:21.638 --> 32:22.838
Ten-one, officer down.

32:22.840 --> 32:25.875
Sending EMT
and all available units.

32:25.877 --> 32:27.511
Ooh.

32:38.022 --> 32:39.922
Show your hands!

32:42.493 --> 32:44.860
I've been shot.

32:44.862 --> 32:47.563
All right, stay with me.
Help's on the way.

32:47.565 --> 32:49.498
What happened in here?

32:49.500 --> 32:52.836
Did he escape?

32:52.838 --> 32:54.771
Who?

32:54.773 --> 32:56.809
Did who escape?

33:00.979 --> 33:03.379
Well, I got a cousin
works at a graveyard

33:03.381 --> 33:05.482
- not too far from here.
- Hmm.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.117
They got war generals,

33:07.119 --> 33:10.487
philanthropists,
a beatnik poet.

33:10.489 --> 33:11.988
They got Muddy Waters.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.623
Oh, and they got Bernie Mac.

33:13.625 --> 33:16.127
People come from all over
to pay respects.

33:16.129 --> 33:17.828
But this is Haddonfield,

33:17.830 --> 33:20.697
and this is our only claim
to fame.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.766
Maybe you can explain to me

33:22.768 --> 33:24.904
what's so special
about Judith Myers.

33:26.605 --> 33:30.174
As she sat combing her hair,
unaware,

33:30.176 --> 33:32.510
her six-year-old brother
crept in quietly

33:32.512 --> 33:34.812
with a kitchen knife.

33:34.814 --> 33:39.050
He then proceeded
to slice the base of her skull,

33:39.052 --> 33:41.953
scraping her spinal cord.

33:41.955 --> 33:43.855
When she turned,

33:43.857 --> 33:47.658
raising her hands
in self-defense,

33:47.660 --> 33:49.962
he continued stabbing

33:49.964 --> 33:53.000
into the nerves
and arteries of her palms.

33:54.802 --> 33:57.668
Three more stabs
into her sternum,

33:57.670 --> 33:59.773
penetrating her heart.

34:09.016 --> 34:10.985
Hawkins.

34:12.853 --> 34:15.621
Still checking I.D.'s
of the patients we recovered

34:15.623 --> 34:17.489
to figure out who's who.

34:17.491 --> 34:18.991
Almost all accounted for.

34:18.993 --> 34:22.027
Two of them were checking their
e-mails at a local library.

34:22.030 --> 34:23.795
Just found three of 'em
holding hands,

34:23.797 --> 34:26.531
chasing butterflies
at a flea market off the 220.

34:26.533 --> 34:27.900
Butterflies?

34:27.902 --> 34:30.636
Still no idea
what really went down.

34:30.638 --> 34:33.239
Any word from
Mr. Rip van Winkle over here?

34:33.241 --> 34:35.174
Nurses say
he's been in and out,

34:35.176 --> 34:36.542
lost a lot of blood.

34:36.543 --> 34:37.976
Somehow managed
to fall on a bullet.

34:37.978 --> 34:39.746
I'm trying to get
the whole story

34:39.748 --> 34:41.880
because here's my concern:

34:41.882 --> 34:44.150
Take a look at this list.

34:44.152 --> 34:47.620
Most of 'em minor offenders,
mental patients.

34:47.621 --> 34:50.523
One stuck out: A2201.

34:50.525 --> 34:52.092
It's Michael Myers.

34:52.094 --> 34:55.628
Babysitter Murders, 1978.

34:55.630 --> 34:58.899
40 years to this day.

34:58.901 --> 35:02.535
Michael Myers loose
with a bunch of nutbags

35:02.537 --> 35:05.072
in Haddonfield
on Halloween night?

35:05.074 --> 35:08.008
We're gonna have
a fucking circus on our hands.

35:08.010 --> 35:10.044
But hey.

35:10.046 --> 35:12.146
What are we gonna do?

35:12.148 --> 35:14.081
Cancel Halloween?

35:15.685 --> 35:18.688
Dr. Ray,
please pick up line two.

35:33.837 --> 35:36.271
I need to go do a number two
almost immediately.

35:36.273 --> 35:39.776
- Can I drive?
- Come on, get in the car. Move it.

35:49.220 --> 35:51.553
Want anything from the shop?

35:51.555 --> 35:53.191
No. No, thank you.

36:09.607 --> 36:11.142
Hmm.

36:12.877 --> 36:14.710
- Where's the loo?
- Excuse me?

36:14.712 --> 36:16.012
Bathroom.

36:16.014 --> 36:18.149
It's out that way,
around the back.

37:46.040 --> 37:48.441
Excuse me. Sorry.

37:48.443 --> 37:50.144
Someone's in here.

37:58.320 --> 37:59.887
Hello?

38:45.868 --> 38:47.069
What the...?

38:59.183 --> 39:00.448
Help me!

39:00.450 --> 39:02.917
Aah! Help me!

39:02.919 --> 39:05.921
Aaron! Aaron!

39:10.294 --> 39:12.996
Aah! Get off me!

39:15.365 --> 39:19.334
Aaron! Stop!

39:19.336 --> 39:21.338
Help me!

39:25.476 --> 39:26.942
Michael.

39:26.944 --> 39:29.813
Aaron! Aaron!

39:46.231 --> 39:47.096
Dana!

39:47.098 --> 39:48.233
- No!
- No, please.

39:59.110 --> 40:00.410
D-Dana!

40:01.547 --> 40:03.148
Aaron.

40:13.559 --> 40:15.995
No! No...

40:52.332 --> 40:53.865
Police have not determined

40:53.867 --> 40:55.367
a cause of this accident.

40:55.369 --> 40:58.069
Uh, this scene's still
very active, of course.

40:58.071 --> 41:00.071
You can see the police tape
set up behind me.

41:00.073 --> 41:02.441
That prison bus
firmly down in that ditch.

41:02.443 --> 41:04.343
You can see the tow truck,
of course,

41:04.345 --> 41:07.046
that is trying to get
that prison bus out.

41:07.048 --> 41:08.947
A source tells us that bus

41:08.949 --> 41:12.186
was transporting personnel
from a local state hospital.

41:16.324 --> 41:18.390
13 A-9.

41:21.195 --> 41:22.562
Roger.

42:14.550 --> 42:16.152
Ray?

42:21.991 --> 42:23.993
Allyson?

42:26.730 --> 42:29.232
Allyson? Is anyone home?

42:39.143 --> 42:41.211
- Karen?
- Shh.

42:42.546 --> 42:44.148
What?

42:45.282 --> 42:47.115
- Gotcha!
- - Jesus.

42:47.117 --> 42:48.116
You're dead.

42:48.118 --> 42:49.451
You scared me!

42:49.453 --> 42:51.253
What are you doing
in our house?

42:51.255 --> 42:53.321
You mean, how did
I get into your house?

42:53.323 --> 42:55.625
You have no
security system, Karen.

42:55.627 --> 42:57.459
Your side window was wide open.

42:57.461 --> 42:59.462
Sometimes I can't tell
the difference

42:59.464 --> 43:01.464
between your stupidity
and your ignorance.

43:01.466 --> 43:03.231
Hey, Laurie, this is my home,

43:03.233 --> 43:05.435
and I can take care
of my own family, all right?

43:05.437 --> 43:07.035
I know jujitsu.
I have studied...

43:07.037 --> 43:08.204
- The bus crashed.
- Ray.

43:08.206 --> 43:09.605
- What?
- Look, I have a plan.

43:09.607 --> 43:12.074
Where's Allyson?
We need to get out of here now.

43:12.076 --> 43:14.177
What bus crashed?

43:14.179 --> 43:16.646
- Put down that gun. Put down...
- Hey, hey. Back off!

43:16.648 --> 43:19.081
Put down that gun. You're in
my... Put down the gun!

43:19.083 --> 43:21.384
Mom, you need help,

43:21.386 --> 43:24.320
and you are not welcome
in this house until you get it.

43:24.322 --> 43:26.322
I have tried to protect you
and prepare you.

43:26.324 --> 43:28.024
Now we have to hunt him down.

43:28.026 --> 43:31.360
Yeah, and I am trying to
prepare dinner for my family.

43:31.362 --> 43:33.564
The world is not
a dark and evil place.

43:33.566 --> 43:35.699
It is full of love
and understanding,

43:35.701 --> 43:38.769
and I'm not letting your
psychotic rants confuse me

43:38.771 --> 43:40.337
or convince me otherwise.

43:40.339 --> 43:43.073
- Keep the gun.
- No! You need to go.

43:43.075 --> 43:44.677
Get out!

43:53.185 --> 43:55.554
Son of a bitch.

44:07.834 --> 44:10.635
Hawkins.

44:10.637 --> 44:12.704
Frank!

44:12.706 --> 44:14.105
Yeah?

44:14.107 --> 44:16.243
Look at this.

44:17.511 --> 44:20.311
- It's a hospital gown.
- State-issued.

44:20.313 --> 44:21.780
Get on the phone
to Smith's Grove.

44:21.782 --> 44:23.515
Confirm the match.

44:23.517 --> 44:26.117
You know I was there
that night. You know.

44:26.119 --> 44:28.455
I was there.

44:29.790 --> 44:32.390
We have one order of business.

44:32.392 --> 44:35.228
That's to hunt this thing down.

44:38.266 --> 44:42.167
There's a reason we're supposed
to be afraid of this night.

44:42.169 --> 44:44.537
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

44:53.882 --> 44:56.181
Which one should we go to?

44:56.183 --> 44:57.216
They're all spooky.

44:57.218 --> 44:58.484
I'm gonna pick that one

44:58.486 --> 45:00.185
over, um, across the street.

45:00.187 --> 45:02.254
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

45:02.256 --> 45:04.891
- What the...? Sorry.
- Hey. Sorry about that.

45:06.461 --> 45:08.461
Black cats and goblins

45:08.463 --> 45:10.430
and broomsticks and ghosts,

45:10.432 --> 45:14.200
Covens of witches
with all of their hosts,

45:14.202 --> 45:16.469
You may think they scare me,

45:16.471 --> 45:18.438
You're probably right,

45:18.440 --> 45:22.242
Black cats and goblins
on Halloween night.

45:38.728 --> 45:39.894
Please!

45:39.896 --> 45:42.496
- Please let us out of here!
- Where did they come from?

46:04.655 --> 46:08.356
You are from the other side.

46:08.358 --> 46:10.492
You are the sign.

46:38.590 --> 46:41.860
- Trick or treat!
- Hey, guys. Stay together.

46:43.828 --> 46:45.530
Very scary.

46:48.533 --> 46:50.299
- Mila. Mila, no!
- Trick or treat...

46:50.301 --> 46:51.801
- Wait your turn.
- ...smell my feet,

46:51.803 --> 46:53.803
- give me something good to eat.
- Wait, hang on, hang on.

46:53.805 --> 46:55.672
- I don't have my stethoscope.
- Come on!

46:55.674 --> 46:57.540
- I need it. I'm gonna get it.
- We're going to be late.

46:57.542 --> 46:59.544
- I'll be right back.
- Geez!

47:06.552 --> 47:08.786
Look. You're not
gonna believe this.

47:08.788 --> 47:10.788
They were in my pocket
the whole time.

47:10.790 --> 47:12.423
Did Rebecca
give you directions?

47:12.425 --> 47:13.991
Yeah. She did call me.

47:23.703 --> 47:26.305
Hey, Sally. How are you?

47:27.673 --> 47:29.375
Really?

47:32.979 --> 47:34.915
That's awful.

47:36.717 --> 47:38.983
Well, I'll keep
my doors locked.

47:41.387 --> 47:43.490
Thanks for telling me.

47:45.392 --> 47:47.828
Billy's still out at a party.

47:50.297 --> 47:53.366
Let me know if you hear
anything else.

48:01.408 --> 48:03.410
Good night, Sally.

48:25.633 --> 48:27.500
Trick or treat!

48:27.502 --> 48:29.535
Bonnie and Clyde,
you are lady-killers.

48:29.537 --> 48:30.871
You guys are
seriously beautiful.

48:30.873 --> 48:32.505
You're seriously beautif...
Give me a smile.

48:32.507 --> 48:33.907
Give me a big smile.
Just hold her tight.

48:33.909 --> 48:36.542
There we go. Do that.
Do that with your ass.

48:59.601 --> 49:02.569
Okay, so, no, not...

49:02.571 --> 49:04.604
It's Vicky.
One second. One sec.

49:06.009 --> 49:08.542
Okay, you don't...
you don't have to take it.

49:11.548 --> 49:13.648
Hi. Oh, my gosh,
I wish that you were here.

49:13.650 --> 49:15.049
It is so much fun.

49:15.051 --> 49:17.718
God, I wish I was there.
I'm so fuckin' bummed.

49:17.720 --> 49:19.554
It's just, like, so much easier

49:19.556 --> 49:21.756
to actually, like, talk
to people when you have no idea

49:21.758 --> 49:23.958
- who they are.
- Yeah, dude, I told you you'd have fun.

49:23.960 --> 49:26.128
How's Cameron?
Is he looking super fine

49:26.130 --> 49:27.829
in my grandma's skirt?

49:27.831 --> 49:29.597
He is...

49:29.599 --> 49:31.866
so sexy,
it's a little too much to take.

49:31.868 --> 49:33.969
But...

49:33.971 --> 49:37.438
- Where'd you go?
- No, he's so sweet.

49:37.440 --> 49:38.941
- I'm having the best time.
- You know, you guys

49:38.943 --> 49:40.242
should just come over here
when it's done.

49:40.244 --> 49:42.978
Dave's already on his way,
and he's gonna bring the, uh,

49:42.980 --> 49:45.447
you know, the "Alakazam,"
if you know what I mean.

49:45.449 --> 49:47.416
And Julian's parents
aren't gonna be back

49:47.418 --> 49:48.584
until, like, super late.

49:48.586 --> 49:50.118
Okay, well,
it is a school night,

49:50.120 --> 49:52.654
so we're not gonna...
"kazam" too much.

49:52.656 --> 49:54.690
Oh, come on.
It's a "school night."

49:54.692 --> 49:56.959
Don't be a needy bitch.
Get over here.

49:56.961 --> 49:58.727
Okay. I'll see you soon.
We'll come over

49:58.729 --> 50:01.030
- as soon as it's over.
- Okay, bye. Love you.

50:01.032 --> 50:02.966
I heard you telling
your friends to come over here

50:02.968 --> 50:05.001
- and you're gonna smoke some weed.
- No. No.

50:05.003 --> 50:07.003
- That "Alakazam"?
- Julian, I'm talking about,

50:07.005 --> 50:08.905
like, uh, you know,
like, a ma-magic trick,

50:08.907 --> 50:10.807
- like, "abracadabra."
- I know you're talking

50:10.809 --> 50:12.976
about smoking weed.
Don't lie to me.

50:12.978 --> 50:15.144
That's against the rules.
I'm telling my mom.

50:15.146 --> 50:17.146
Well, I'm gonna tell your mom
about your browser history.

50:17.148 --> 50:19.616
- You better not.
- You can get me in trouble,

50:19.618 --> 50:21.985
- I can get you in trouble.
- I'm...

50:21.987 --> 50:23.820
You used to be my favorite,
but now you're,

50:23.822 --> 50:25.788
like, my tenth favorite boy
that I nanny.

50:25.790 --> 50:28.758
And I babysit
some fucking loser kids.

50:28.760 --> 50:30.727
If I had some
other kind of babysitter,

50:30.729 --> 50:32.029
she'd be reading me a story.

50:32.031 --> 50:35.632
I wouldn't be up
clipping my nasty-ass toenails.

50:35.634 --> 50:37.634
- Uh-huh. Go to bed.
- You used to be cool.

50:37.636 --> 50:40.037
We used to be friends.
But now...

50:40.039 --> 50:42.773
Okay. Come on, go to bed.

50:42.775 --> 50:44.942
- Wait.
- It's way past your bedtime.

50:44.944 --> 50:46.577
- You want to be a good kid?
- Mm-hmm.

50:46.579 --> 50:48.579
- Mm-hmm. Go to bed, go to bed.
- How much do you get paid?

50:48.581 --> 50:50.481
Come on, let's go, let's go.

50:50.483 --> 50:52.149
I'll get ya. Come on.

50:53.686 --> 50:56.187
Good night, little dude.

50:56.189 --> 50:57.855
Hey, Vicky.

50:57.857 --> 51:01.059
Can you leave the door open?
Just a crack?

51:01.061 --> 51:03.161
Yeah.

51:03.163 --> 51:04.864
Good night.

51:06.666 --> 51:10.737
By the way, you're actually
my favorite kid I babysit for.

51:11.671 --> 51:13.672
I like you, too.

51:13.674 --> 51:15.206
Good night.

52:11.300 --> 52:14.003
That is not what...

52:15.037 --> 52:17.871
Fuck. Okay, that really...

52:17.873 --> 52:20.173
that fucked me up. Okay.

52:23.245 --> 52:24.644
Allyson!

52:24.646 --> 52:26.980
Allyson, come here!

52:29.018 --> 52:30.951
- Wait. Hey, Allyson.
- No. What was that?

52:30.953 --> 52:32.819
- Okay, what? What? Hey, wh...
- What was that?

52:32.821 --> 52:34.888
- What?
- What's this?

52:34.890 --> 52:37.291
What? Dude, have
some discretion, all right?

52:37.293 --> 52:39.927
I don't know what you
thought you saw, but, like,

52:39.929 --> 52:43.097
I... Kim...
literally was talking to me.

52:43.099 --> 52:44.999
- Really?
- She came up to me and, like,

52:45.001 --> 52:46.300
whispered in my ear, okay?

52:46.302 --> 52:47.769
You don't have to cry about it.

52:47.771 --> 52:49.270
It's not that big a deal.

52:49.272 --> 52:51.639
- So Oscar got you fucked up?
- No, I got...

52:51.641 --> 52:54.242
I mean,
I got me fucked up. I...

52:54.244 --> 52:56.210
Okay.

52:56.212 --> 52:58.913
- Hey, okay, can we just talk? Okay.
- Don't.

52:58.915 --> 53:00.915
Okay, here, you know what? No.

53:00.917 --> 53:02.886
Your fucking precious phone?

53:07.724 --> 53:08.923
What the fuck?

53:08.925 --> 53:09.925
You gonna get that?

53:09.927 --> 53:11.193
Or you want me to get it?

53:21.172 --> 53:23.672
Hold... hold up, hold up.
Wait, wait, wait.

53:23.674 --> 53:25.040
I'm done.

53:27.912 --> 53:29.345
<i>This is Unit 14.</i>

53:29.347 --> 53:30.612
- <i>I'm out by Old Lady Miller's house.</i>
- Oh, shit.

53:30.614 --> 53:33.715
<i>I don't see anything
suspicious out here. Over.</i>

53:33.717 --> 53:36.086
Uh, ten-four.
You want to go ahead and, uh,

53:36.088 --> 53:37.753
show yourself code two,
officially cancel

53:37.755 --> 53:38.821
request for assistance?

53:38.823 --> 53:41.690
Uh, affirmative. Over.

54:13.426 --> 54:15.159
Oh, shit.

54:15.161 --> 54:16.393
- Sorry.
- Hi.

54:16.395 --> 54:18.229
I didn't want to ring the
doorbell and wake up the kid.

54:18.231 --> 54:19.997
- It's okay.
- Check it out. Fresh from my patch.

54:19.999 --> 54:21.398
- Oh, my God.
- His eyes are hearts.

54:21.400 --> 54:22.766
- I love it.
- Yeah.

54:22.768 --> 54:23.901
- This is Tate.
- Hello. Hi, Tate.

54:23.903 --> 54:26.003
- Hello. What's up?
- Hi. How are ya?

54:26.005 --> 54:27.738
Do we have the whole house
to ourselves?

54:27.740 --> 54:29.073
- Is that how this works?
- Yes.

54:29.075 --> 54:31.175
- Sweet.
- Until Allyson and Cameron get here.

54:31.177 --> 54:34.479
Okay, so, in the meantime,
you want to make some popcorn

54:34.481 --> 54:36.181
and watch a spooky movie?

54:36.183 --> 54:38.849
- Mm, no.
- All right, wait, check this out.

54:38.851 --> 54:40.953
You're gonna like this.

54:42.256 --> 54:44.890
I went...

54:44.892 --> 54:46.958
and got this tattoo.

54:46.960 --> 54:48.793
Because tonight is the night,

54:48.795 --> 54:51.229
the one we'll remember
for the rest of our lives.

54:51.231 --> 54:53.198
You are so getting
dry-fucked tonight.

54:53.200 --> 54:56.902
- Oh, yeah?
- Fuckin' come here.

55:06.880 --> 55:08.414
What?

55:08.416 --> 55:11.417
- What was that?
- What was what?

55:11.419 --> 55:13.818
Did you hear something?

55:13.820 --> 55:15.955
No. What was it?

55:15.957 --> 55:17.256
I don't know. I thought...

55:17.258 --> 55:19.325
I thought I heard, like,
a noise or something.

55:19.327 --> 55:22.528
Yeah, it's probably just Julian
taking a dump.

55:22.530 --> 55:24.397
Would you go look?

55:24.399 --> 55:26.365
Do I have to?

55:26.367 --> 55:27.833
Yeah, would you please go look?

55:27.835 --> 55:30.169
Okay.

55:30.171 --> 55:32.838
- It was weird.
- All right.

55:32.840 --> 55:35.311
All right, little buddy.

55:39.113 --> 55:41.348
- Oh, fuck me.
- I saw someone in the hallway,

55:41.350 --> 55:42.782
standing outside my door.

55:42.784 --> 55:43.950
- Oh.
- What's up, buddy?

55:43.952 --> 55:46.852
There was a fucked-up face,
watching me from the dark.

55:46.854 --> 55:48.255
Ghosts and goblins,
little buddy?

55:48.257 --> 55:49.957
Shut up, Dave!
I heard him breathing,

55:49.959 --> 55:52.059
and then I saw him.
He's in here.

55:52.061 --> 55:53.227
Boogeyman's in this house.

55:53.229 --> 55:55.462
Okay. All right.
Come on, I got you.

55:55.464 --> 55:58.799
- Let's check it out.
- Send Dave first.

55:58.801 --> 56:00.468
- No, it's fine. It's fine.
- No, no. No, it's not.

56:00.470 --> 56:02.236
- It's okay. Come on.
- No, it's not. No, it's not.

56:02.238 --> 56:03.371
Come on, show me
where you saw Boogeyman.

56:03.373 --> 56:04.606
- I'll protect you. I'm strong. I got you.
- No.

56:04.608 --> 56:06.840
- No, Vicky, you go up there first.
- I'll fight him off.

56:06.842 --> 56:07.841
- Come on. I promise.
- No.

56:07.843 --> 56:10.345
- Can you call my mom?
- Yeah.

56:10.347 --> 56:12.113
If there's something
in the room, I'll call her.

56:12.115 --> 56:14.349
He was standing right there
in-in the door.

56:14.351 --> 56:16.453
I'll check it out.

56:25.161 --> 56:26.961
Excuse me, sir.

56:26.963 --> 56:29.130
What are you doing in here?

56:29.132 --> 56:31.866
Please, you need to leave.

56:31.868 --> 56:33.370
Please leave.

56:34.538 --> 56:36.137
Vicky?

56:36.139 --> 56:38.108
Get out now!

56:40.844 --> 56:42.977
- Gotcha.
- You fucking kidding me?

56:42.979 --> 56:44.580
You're safe.

56:44.582 --> 56:46.015
Nothing's in here.

56:46.017 --> 56:48.883
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

56:48.885 --> 56:51.020
Y-You check
behind the curtains?

56:51.022 --> 56:53.055
I checked the whole place.

57:32.464 --> 57:34.397
Sick.

57:34.399 --> 57:36.333
See? There's nothing
to be afraid of.

57:36.335 --> 57:38.602
There's no Boogeyman in here.

57:38.604 --> 57:40.338
What if it's a doll?

57:40.340 --> 57:43.607
Ooh, it could be, like, one of
those weird, like, kid dolls,

57:43.609 --> 57:46.076
one of those weird babies,
and they stare at you

57:46.078 --> 57:48.446
with those beady little eyes.

58:02.028 --> 58:03.963
Oh, fuck, that was... Oh!

58:05.031 --> 58:07.200
Ah, sharia.

58:10.269 --> 58:13.438
Uh, c-could you close
the closet door?

58:13.440 --> 58:15.209
Yeah.

58:29.089 --> 58:31.590
Oh, shit!

58:31.592 --> 58:33.992
Oh, God.

58:33.994 --> 58:35.360
No!

58:35.362 --> 58:37.162
Oh!

58:43.405 --> 58:45.671
Help! Dave!

58:45.673 --> 58:47.206
Help me!

58:47.208 --> 58:50.309
Vicky!

58:50.311 --> 58:52.445
Whoa!

58:52.447 --> 58:54.280
Julian, run!

58:54.282 --> 58:57.116
- I'll go get help. Dave! Dave!
- Vicky?

58:57.118 --> 58:59.419
Get out of here!

58:59.421 --> 59:03.122
Don't go up there!
You're gonna get killed, Dave.

59:03.124 --> 59:04.123
Somebody help me!

59:04.125 --> 59:05.224
- Dave, help me!
- Vicky.

59:05.226 --> 59:06.727
No, no, no, no, no, no.

59:06.729 --> 59:08.462
No, no, no.

59:09.698 --> 59:12.566
No! No!

59:12.568 --> 59:14.066
Fuck this.

59:19.575 --> 59:21.508
All units, we have reports

59:21.510 --> 59:23.343
of a domestic disturbance
at 707 Meridian Avenue.

59:23.345 --> 59:25.179
Please respond. Over.

59:25.181 --> 59:26.480
Copy that, Dispatch.

59:31.554 --> 59:34.154
Okay, guys,
don't forget to say thank you.

59:46.736 --> 59:49.304
Come on.
That's enough. No, come on.

59:49.306 --> 59:52.142
No, they can have
a little more, honey.

01:00:05.489 --> 01:00:09.357
Trick or treat, smell my feet,

01:00:09.359 --> 01:00:12.295
give me something good to eat.

01:00:29.447 --> 01:00:32.648
Haddonfield
Sheriff's Department!

01:00:32.650 --> 01:00:35.721
Responding
to a domestic disturbance!

01:00:44.395 --> 01:00:47.864
I repeat.
This is Officer Hawkins.

01:00:47.866 --> 01:00:49.701
Please respond.

01:01:06.786 --> 01:01:09.687
Honey, watch out!

01:01:09.689 --> 01:01:12.355
Get out of here! Now!

01:01:12.357 --> 01:01:13.791
Let's go, guys. Move.

01:01:13.793 --> 01:01:15.294
Get inside!

01:02:09.818 --> 01:02:10.883
Fuck!

01:02:30.739 --> 01:02:32.607
Michael!

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:47.355
Oh, shit.

01:03:10.279 --> 01:03:11.278
Laurie. Fuck!

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:13.280
Jesus Christ, Frank!

01:03:13.282 --> 01:03:14.816
- Fuck me!
- What the fuck?

01:03:17.386 --> 01:03:18.553
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:03:18.555 --> 01:03:20.855
Frank, he's here.

01:03:20.857 --> 01:03:22.457
I know.

01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:36.038
This way, please.

01:03:45.549 --> 01:03:47.819
Look who's up.

01:03:49.453 --> 01:03:51.589
Where is he?

01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:54.625
You tell me.

01:03:58.596 --> 01:04:01.464
<i>The bus lost control
after Michael</i>

01:04:01.466 --> 01:04:03.466
overtook the first guard
and the driver.

01:04:03.468 --> 01:04:05.068
He's no longer dormant.

01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:07.003
He only knows
how to keep moving

01:04:07.005 --> 01:04:08.604
and to keep killing.

01:04:08.606 --> 01:04:10.876
And he will kill again
unless he's captured.

01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:14.745
Come with me for a minute.

01:04:14.747 --> 01:04:16.312
You sit still.

01:04:16.314 --> 01:04:17.848
Well, I was
sitting still anyway.

01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:19.783
- What do you mean?
- He's an asset.

01:04:19.785 --> 01:04:21.718
He's not an asset.
He's a liability.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.520
No, no. He's on this hunt.

01:04:23.522 --> 01:04:25.856
Nobody knows Myers
better than he does.

01:04:25.858 --> 01:04:28.492
- Oh, thank you.
- You want me to take

01:04:28.494 --> 01:04:30.026
this injured civilian
to go look for

01:04:30.028 --> 01:04:32.496
- a psychopathic serial killer?
- Sheriff.

01:04:32.498 --> 01:04:33.897
Frank. Wha-What are we doing?

01:04:33.899 --> 01:04:34.965
We don't need your help
right now, Laurie.

01:04:34.967 --> 01:04:38.335
You're just standing here!
Please do something!

01:04:38.337 --> 01:04:39.538
Excuse me, officers.

01:04:40.472 --> 01:04:42.708
Laurie Strode.

01:04:46.545 --> 01:04:49.881
Laurie Strode,
meet Dr. Sartain.

01:04:49.883 --> 01:04:51.916
I'm Michael's doctor.

01:04:51.918 --> 01:04:53.518
Ranbir Sartain.

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:56.689
Oh, you're the new Loomis.

01:04:57.857 --> 01:05:00.827
I read everything
about you and Michael.

01:05:03.129 --> 01:05:04.998
Everything.

01:05:06.399 --> 01:05:08.599
Did you know
our friend Hawkins here

01:05:08.601 --> 01:05:10.735
was the first responding deputy

01:05:10.737 --> 01:05:14.006
when Michael
was apprehended in 1978?

01:05:14.008 --> 01:05:16.875
He stopped Loomis from
killing Michael that night.

01:05:16.877 --> 01:05:21.512
Do you know
that I pray every night

01:05:21.514 --> 01:05:23.481
that he would escape?

01:05:23.483 --> 01:05:26.018
What the hell
do you do that for?

01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:28.520
So I can kill him.

01:05:28.522 --> 01:05:31.559
Well, that was a dumb thing
to pray for.

01:05:37.865 --> 01:05:40.432
I'm sure he'll apologize.
He just needs to sleep it off.

01:05:40.434 --> 01:05:42.902
Cameron doesn't want anyone
to see him as a bad guy,

01:05:42.904 --> 01:05:46.005
but then he gets drunk
and gets belligerent

01:05:46.007 --> 01:05:47.740
and looks like an idiot.

01:05:47.742 --> 01:05:52.511
And then I look like
an idiot for vouching for him.

01:05:52.513 --> 01:05:57.686
I'm really tired of everybody
letting me down all the time.

01:05:59.487 --> 01:06:02.121
You deserve better.

01:06:02.123 --> 01:06:03.957
I mean...

01:06:03.959 --> 01:06:05.859
Allyson, you're the
coolest, you're the prettiest,

01:06:05.861 --> 01:06:07.827
and you're the nicest girl
in school.

01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:09.529
And if anyone
doesn't appreciate that,

01:06:09.531 --> 01:06:11.999
they're a crazy person.

01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:13.433
Thank you.

01:06:13.435 --> 01:06:15.570
That's very sweet.

01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:20.440
Let's get out of here.

01:06:20.442 --> 01:06:22.475
I know a shortcut.

01:06:22.477 --> 01:06:24.111
<i>From a clinical perspective,</i>

01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:26.480
Doctor, would you say
that Laurie Strode

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:28.015
has lost her fucking marbles?

01:06:28.017 --> 01:06:30.184
There are many ways
for tragedy and violence

01:06:30.186 --> 01:06:31.986
to change a victim.

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:35.589
They can grow accustomed
to always being afraid,

01:06:35.591 --> 01:06:37.758
in constant fear.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.828
They can grow weak,
they can grow strong.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.998
But there's also
the other side.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.498
What other side is that?

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.800
The effect on the victimizer.

01:06:46.802 --> 01:06:49.738
You see, this is
what has intrigued me

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:51.740
through my studies.

01:06:51.742 --> 01:06:54.776
How does a crime
like Michael's affect him?

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:58.713
Hmm? What's that feeling?

01:06:58.715 --> 01:07:02.183
Is he on a random path,
or is he emotionally driven?

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:03.852
Triggered by something?

01:07:03.854 --> 01:07:06.521
Perhaps some
unheard marching order

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:08.890
imprinted on his very being.

01:07:08.892 --> 01:07:11.026
I want to know
what he's feeling.

01:07:11.028 --> 01:07:14.629
I want to know what pleasure
he gets out of killing.

01:07:14.631 --> 01:07:16.866
Where is this killer?
We gotta find him.

01:07:16.868 --> 01:07:19.668
I'm not gonna stand in
the way of justice this time.

01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:21.670
Remember,
he's property of the state.

01:07:21.672 --> 01:07:24.273
- He mustn't be harmed.
- Oh, yeah?

01:07:24.275 --> 01:07:26.676
We'll see about that.

01:07:55.708 --> 01:07:57.710
It's not safe here.

01:07:58.777 --> 01:08:00.277
Where's Allyson?

01:08:00.279 --> 01:08:01.712
Where is she?

01:08:01.714 --> 01:08:03.246
Where's Allyson?!

01:08:03.248 --> 01:08:05.082
Honey, it's Mom.
Can you please call me back

01:08:05.084 --> 01:08:06.717
the second that
you get this, please?

01:08:06.719 --> 01:08:08.118
The police said that
they evacuated the dance,

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.987
and I can't get in touch
with you.

01:08:09.989 --> 01:08:11.722
And they're making us go
to your grandmother's house

01:08:11.724 --> 01:08:12.990
because it's safe...

01:08:12.992 --> 01:08:14.992
Sweetheart,
this is your grandmother.

01:08:14.994 --> 01:08:17.295
There is a police officer
waiting at your house

01:08:17.296 --> 01:08:18.997
to bring you to us.

01:08:18.999 --> 01:08:20.865
We're all gonna be together.

01:08:20.867 --> 01:08:22.966
Now, do as I say.

01:08:22.969 --> 01:08:25.036
Oh, shit.

01:08:25.037 --> 01:08:26.603
It's treacherous as hell here.

01:08:26.604 --> 01:08:27.872
- Okay.
- You good?

01:08:27.874 --> 01:08:29.273
- Take my hand.
- Okay.

01:08:29.274 --> 01:08:30.975
- Right here.
- This is the dumbest shortcut ever.

01:08:30.977 --> 01:08:33.111
Watch out
for all the poison ivy.

01:08:33.113 --> 01:08:34.946
- Don't let me fall on that.
- All right. I got you.

01:08:34.948 --> 01:08:36.714
- I got you. Okay, I got you.
- Okay, go.

01:08:36.716 --> 01:08:38.283
- Oh!
- Okay.

01:08:38.285 --> 01:08:39.283
You did it. Yay.

01:08:39.286 --> 01:08:41.051
Good job.

01:08:41.054 --> 01:08:42.254
Yay.

01:08:42.256 --> 01:08:43.654
What are you doing?

01:08:43.656 --> 01:08:45.756
I mean, you deserve better.

01:08:45.759 --> 01:08:47.759
- Right? I mean...
- No...

01:08:47.761 --> 01:08:49.861
What the fuck?

01:08:49.863 --> 01:08:51.029
I-I... What? You're not
with Cameron anymore.

01:08:51.032 --> 01:08:53.032
That does not...

01:08:53.033 --> 01:08:54.899
That does not mean
I want to be with you.

01:08:54.902 --> 01:08:57.169
I thought... I thought
you were sending me signals.

01:08:57.171 --> 01:08:59.671
- Definitely no signals.
- I'm so sorry.

01:08:59.673 --> 01:09:01.106
Please, you cannot
tell Cameron about this.

01:09:01.108 --> 01:09:03.008
I-I didn't feel anything,
either. I swear.

01:09:03.010 --> 01:09:05.044
- I didn't... Wait, I didn't...
- You are so pathetic.

01:09:05.046 --> 01:09:08.781
I'm going home. You can
figure your own shit out.

01:09:08.783 --> 01:09:10.682
Sh... Who's there?
Wha-What... Hey!

01:09:10.684 --> 01:09:12.819
Motion sensor, dumb-ass!

01:09:14.322 --> 01:09:16.055
Allyson, I'm, like,

01:09:16.058 --> 01:09:18.291
really drunk right now.
Seriously.

01:09:18.292 --> 01:09:20.859
I got really horny
at the party, and, like,

01:09:20.861 --> 01:09:23.395
all these girls were,
like, dancing on me.

01:09:23.398 --> 01:09:26.366
Their beautiful bodies got me
all chubbed out, Allyson.

01:09:26.368 --> 01:09:27.966
I... Allyson, please!

01:09:27.969 --> 01:09:30.270
They, like...
they were feeding me guacamole

01:09:30.272 --> 01:09:33.273
in all these sexy ways.

01:09:33.274 --> 01:09:35.010
It's not my...

01:09:44.653 --> 01:09:47.087
Happy Halloween, Mr. Elrod.
I'm-I'm just...

01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:48.787
I don't know, man. I'm sorry.

01:09:48.790 --> 01:09:51.158
I'm not trying to trespass
on your yard and shit, man.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:53.160
I was just trying
to take a shortcut

01:09:53.162 --> 01:09:55.229
with a really pretty girl,
and I just...

01:09:55.231 --> 01:09:57.098
I just really like her, man,

01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:59.200
and I-I thought
that she liked me, too.

01:09:59.202 --> 01:10:00.768
And I just... it just...

01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:02.403
Have you ever
really liked a girl

01:10:02.405 --> 01:10:04.207
and you just couldn't have her?

01:10:05.408 --> 01:10:07.074
I'm s... I'm sorry, man.

01:10:07.076 --> 01:10:09.176
I'll just... I'll peace out
of your hair, man.

01:10:09.178 --> 01:10:12.849
Thank-thank you for...

01:10:20.190 --> 01:10:21.990
Hey, uh...

01:10:21.992 --> 01:10:23.858
where'd you go, man?
You're acting...

01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:25.759
Dude, you're acting, like,

01:10:25.761 --> 01:10:27.865
really sketchy right now.
I don't...

01:10:29.099 --> 01:10:30.167
Uh...

01:10:32.302 --> 01:10:34.336
What's up?

01:10:36.707 --> 01:10:39.343
I'm-I'm-I'm leaving right...
I don't...

01:10:40.411 --> 01:10:41.879
I'm...

01:10:49.786 --> 01:10:53.356
Ow! Oh, my God! Aah! Aah!

01:10:53.358 --> 01:10:54.423
Help me! Help!

01:10:54.425 --> 01:10:55.757
Please! Somebody!

01:10:55.759 --> 01:10:57.193
Somebody, help me, please!

01:10:57.195 --> 01:10:58.895
Somebody, please!
Please, somebody!

01:10:58.897 --> 01:11:00.796
Somebody, please help me!
Please!

01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:02.765
Please, somebody, help me! Aah!

01:11:02.767 --> 01:11:05.034
- Aah! Anybody!
- Oscar, come on.

01:11:05.036 --> 01:11:06.469
Please, dear God! Please!

01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:08.104
Plea... Please!

01:11:08.106 --> 01:11:10.440
Help me! Help me! Help me!

01:11:10.442 --> 01:11:12.041
Please help me!

01:11:23.489 --> 01:11:25.790
Oscar!

01:11:53.786 --> 01:11:56.454
Help! Let me in!

01:11:56.456 --> 01:11:58.225
Let me in!

01:12:01.528 --> 01:12:03.962
Help!

01:12:03.964 --> 01:12:06.464
Somebody!

01:12:06.466 --> 01:12:08.866
Help!

01:12:08.868 --> 01:12:11.869
Help! Help!

01:12:11.871 --> 01:12:13.472
Somebody!

01:12:13.474 --> 01:12:15.507
Please!

01:12:15.509 --> 01:12:17.108
Help!

01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:18.410
<i>'Cause my daughter
is not calling.</i>

01:12:18.412 --> 01:12:19.744
<i>It's safer for you...</i>

01:12:19.746 --> 01:12:20.812
- She's not texting.
- Come on, Karen, let's go inside.

01:12:20.814 --> 01:12:21.913
Everyone's looking
for your daughter.

01:12:21.915 --> 01:12:24.283
- Let them take care of it.
- So whoever you had

01:12:24.285 --> 01:12:25.417
looking for her is obviously
not able to identify her.

01:12:25.419 --> 01:12:26.652
- We're gonna find your daughter.
- It's Halloween.

01:12:26.654 --> 01:12:27.453
- We're gonna bring her here.
- There are kids everywhere.

01:12:27.455 --> 01:12:29.455
- Karen, come on.
- There is no way.

01:12:29.457 --> 01:12:31.190
- Karen. Karen.
- She had a costume, you know?

01:12:31.192 --> 01:12:33.259
- We need to go in the house.
- We have everybody available...

01:12:33.261 --> 01:12:34.994
In the last 40 years, okay?

01:12:34.996 --> 01:12:37.029
Honey, if you let 'em
do their job, they're gonna...

01:12:37.031 --> 01:12:38.933
Karen!

01:12:44.272 --> 01:12:47.108
Just breathe.
And if you want, we can call...

01:12:51.145 --> 01:12:53.346
Stay in the car, Doctor.

01:12:53.348 --> 01:12:55.148
- You all right?
- Take deep breaths, sweetheart.

01:12:55.150 --> 01:12:56.416
- He's... he's down the street.
- Okay.

01:12:56.418 --> 01:12:58.618
- Okay.
- He's back. He killed my friend.

01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:01.154
Everything's gonna be
all right. It's okay.

01:13:01.156 --> 01:13:02.522
Take a deep breath.

01:13:02.524 --> 01:13:04.891
We're gonna take you back
to your mom, okay?

01:13:04.893 --> 01:13:06.860
I'm a doctor. Lock your doors.

01:13:06.862 --> 01:13:09.362
Everybody, get back to your
houses now and lock your doors.

01:13:09.364 --> 01:13:11.164
We're gonna take you
to your mom.

01:13:11.166 --> 01:13:13.033
Don't worry about him.
Don't worry about him.

01:13:13.035 --> 01:13:14.934
Back in your houses now!

01:13:14.936 --> 01:13:16.437
You heard the officer.

01:13:16.439 --> 01:13:19.005
- What is going on?
- Back in your houses!

01:13:19.007 --> 01:13:20.942
Lock your goddamn doors.

01:13:42.599 --> 01:13:44.198
What's this?

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.202
It's my childhood.

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:51.240
Let's go.

01:14:23.107 --> 01:14:25.042
All right, pick your poison.

01:14:26.177 --> 01:14:29.514
I like a revolver.
They never jam.

01:14:31.483 --> 01:14:34.319
This is accuracy
and stopping power.

01:14:35.954 --> 01:14:37.653
This is tactical.

01:14:37.655 --> 01:14:40.123
He waited for this night.

01:14:40.125 --> 01:14:42.125
He's waited for me.

01:14:42.127 --> 01:14:43.528
I've waited for him.

01:14:45.664 --> 01:14:47.631
Come on, Michael.

01:14:56.342 --> 01:14:58.509
Allyson, keep your eyes open.

01:14:58.511 --> 01:15:00.377
- He is out there somewhere.
- 601.

01:15:00.379 --> 01:15:02.546
Suspect reported on 11th,
near Saint Park.

01:15:02.548 --> 01:15:04.615
Copy that, Dispatch.

01:15:04.617 --> 01:15:06.552
I got eyes.

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:13.424
Look! It's him!

01:15:13.426 --> 01:15:15.294
Here we go.

01:15:16.462 --> 01:15:17.564
Brace yourselves.

01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:21.031
Don't hit him!

01:15:21.033 --> 01:15:22.636
- Watch out!
- Michael!

01:15:29.676 --> 01:15:31.242
Don't shoot him.

01:15:31.244 --> 01:15:34.214
- Doctor, get back in the car.
- No!

01:15:35.148 --> 01:15:37.048
You killed him. He's dead.

01:15:37.050 --> 01:15:38.516
- Stand back.
- No.

01:15:38.518 --> 01:15:40.652
I'm still gonna blow
this motherfucker's brains out.

01:15:40.654 --> 01:15:42.320
Get away.
Leave my patient alone.

01:15:42.322 --> 01:15:44.456
Get away
from the body. Stand back.

01:15:44.458 --> 01:15:47.160
I'm not gonna say it again.
Step away from the suspect.

01:15:48.663 --> 01:15:49.662
Step a...

01:15:56.737 --> 01:15:58.473
Fuck.

01:16:07.048 --> 01:16:09.081
Help! Help!

01:16:09.083 --> 01:16:10.316
Help!

01:16:23.832 --> 01:16:26.833
So this is what it feels like.

01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:33.373
Help!

01:17:15.318 --> 01:17:18.154
- Make room for my patient.
- No!

01:17:19.556 --> 01:17:22.191
No.

01:17:25.563 --> 01:17:27.663
No!

01:17:37.141 --> 01:17:39.575
These people want
to kill this man

01:17:39.577 --> 01:17:41.376
for the crimes you observed.

01:17:41.378 --> 01:17:43.245
The most important opportunity

01:17:43.247 --> 01:17:45.480
to understand the mind
of evil, you see.

01:17:45.482 --> 01:17:48.218
So, when he awakes,
we'll be ready.

01:17:49.253 --> 01:17:50.720
Ready for what?

01:17:50.722 --> 01:17:52.589
The reunion.

01:17:52.591 --> 01:17:55.457
Michael's pursuit
of Laurie Strode

01:17:55.459 --> 01:17:57.860
could be what keeps him alive.

01:17:57.862 --> 01:18:02.498
I would suspect
the notion of being a predator

01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:07.904
or the fear of becoming prey
keeps both of them alive.

01:18:11.576 --> 01:18:13.276
You want a banh mi sandwich?

01:18:13.278 --> 01:18:14.510
A what? What is that?

01:18:14.512 --> 01:18:15.778
- A banh mi sandwich.
- What's a...

01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:17.680
Wh-What is that?
I don't even know what that is.

01:18:17.682 --> 01:18:19.616
I love that about you, Francis.
You're so predictable.

01:18:19.618 --> 01:18:21.885
You're like a PB and J
every day kind of guy.

01:18:21.887 --> 01:18:23.252
Oh, here we go.

01:18:23.254 --> 01:18:24.387
No, a banh mi sandwich.

01:18:24.389 --> 01:18:25.723
Banh mi is essentially just

01:18:25.725 --> 01:18:28.692
the Vietnamese version
of a French baguette.

01:18:28.694 --> 01:18:31.428
- Mm-hmm.
- And the term actually refers

01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:34.598
to the bread and not so much
the contents therein.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:36.834
- Mm.
- But your partner,

01:18:36.836 --> 01:18:38.836
- the greatest partner in the world...
- Oh.

01:18:38.838 --> 01:18:41.405
...made an arrangement
with the Vietnamese folks

01:18:41.407 --> 01:18:42.640
- at the restaurant...
- Mm.

01:18:42.642 --> 01:18:44.508
...and had them make you
your very own

01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:46.746
peanut butter and jelly
banh mi sandwich.

01:18:48.381 --> 01:18:49.914
That sounds disgusting.

01:18:49.916 --> 01:18:51.783
I'm not gonna try that.
I brought my own food.

01:18:51.785 --> 01:18:53.517
- I'm very happy with my...
- What did you bring?

01:18:53.519 --> 01:18:54.786
You want to see what I brought?

01:18:54.788 --> 01:18:57.388
Yeah, I do want to see
what you brought.

01:18:57.390 --> 01:18:58.623
Why don't you look at this?

01:18:58.625 --> 01:19:00.859
- Look at that.
- Oh.

01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:01.926
- Fresh brownie.
- Okay.

01:19:01.928 --> 01:19:04.663
Chocolaty homemade brownie.
I made that myself.

01:19:04.665 --> 01:19:06.564
That's-that's, like,
what a five-year-old would eat

01:19:06.566 --> 01:19:08.500
if they could make
their own lunch.

01:19:08.502 --> 01:19:10.802
I worked
with Michael for years,

01:19:10.804 --> 01:19:13.605
but I've never seen him
in an uncontrolled environment.

01:19:13.607 --> 01:19:15.908
I've never heard him speak,
you see.

01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:19.377
In spite of my encouragements,
he remains unresponsive.

01:19:19.379 --> 01:19:23.685
But tonight,
so many possibilities exist.

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:27.920
He spoke to me.

01:19:27.922 --> 01:19:29.555
- He spoke to you?
- Yeah.

01:19:29.557 --> 01:19:32.290
Um, uh,
when he murdered my friend,

01:19:32.292 --> 01:19:34.927
he saw me,
and-and he spoke to me.

01:19:34.929 --> 01:19:36.295
What did he say?

01:19:36.297 --> 01:19:37.763
- One word.
- What?

01:19:37.765 --> 01:19:40.566
Let me go, and I will tell you
what he said.

01:19:40.568 --> 01:19:41.600
You must tell me.
I must know. You must tell me.

01:19:41.602 --> 01:19:43.536
Let me go, and I'll tell you
what he said.

01:19:43.538 --> 01:19:45.671
Just stop the car,
and I'll tell you what he said.

01:19:52.313 --> 01:19:54.613
What is that?

01:19:54.615 --> 01:19:56.683
That's weird, right?

01:19:56.685 --> 01:19:57.951
Is that Hawkins?

01:19:57.953 --> 01:19:59.753
I don't know.

01:19:59.755 --> 01:20:01.488
What was the word?

01:20:01.490 --> 01:20:03.592
Was it the sister's name?

01:20:06.028 --> 01:20:07.461
Judith?

01:20:14.403 --> 01:20:16.472
- What was the word?
- Fuck.

01:20:18.674 --> 01:20:19.606
Michael.

01:20:26.015 --> 01:20:28.952
606 to 601.

01:20:30.053 --> 01:20:32.053
Hawkins.

01:20:32.055 --> 01:20:33.888
Answer the fucking radio,
burnout.

01:20:33.890 --> 01:20:36.357
Hawkins?

01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:39.093
606, 601.

01:20:39.095 --> 01:20:42.096
Hawkins, please respond.

01:20:42.098 --> 01:20:43.933
Hawkins.

01:20:54.945 --> 01:20:57.748
- Let's go check it out.
- All right.

01:21:07.424 --> 01:21:09.493
Say something.

01:21:32.884 --> 01:21:33.983
Can you see him?

01:21:33.985 --> 01:21:36.553
Hawkins, please respond.

01:21:36.555 --> 01:21:39.825
Hawkins, please respond.

01:21:40.759 --> 01:21:42.392
Let's go and check it out.

01:21:42.394 --> 01:21:43.562
All right.

01:21:57.043 --> 01:21:59.844
Dispatch, be advised,
we got a man down.

01:21:59.846 --> 01:22:00.945
He's ten-seven.

01:22:00.947 --> 01:22:03.049
No sign of 601.

01:22:27.941 --> 01:22:29.808
Karen, the lights.

01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:31.609
What are you doing?

01:22:31.611 --> 01:22:33.178
I thought you said
we were safer here.

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:35.981
You never wanted to listen
when I spoke of that night.

01:22:35.983 --> 01:22:36.982
And this is why.

01:22:36.984 --> 01:22:40.485
I've been preparing for this
for a long time.

01:22:40.487 --> 01:22:41.987
You want him to come here.

01:22:41.989 --> 01:22:45.924
I'm so sorry, Karen.
I'm so sorry, baby.

01:23:33.108 --> 01:23:34.810
Any word?

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:42.885
Hey, any word on Allyson?

01:23:53.196 --> 01:23:54.962
Hey.

01:23:54.964 --> 01:23:56.699
Guys.

01:24:02.272 --> 01:24:04.138
Wha...?

01:24:33.603 --> 01:24:34.872
Ray!

01:24:44.215 --> 01:24:45.916
Karen!

01:24:48.753 --> 01:24:50.721
Where's Ray?

01:24:51.889 --> 01:24:54.126
Michael's here. Get downstairs.

01:24:55.227 --> 01:24:57.195
Go, baby, go!

01:25:50.083 --> 01:25:51.148
Mom!

01:25:58.258 --> 01:25:59.226
Mom!

01:26:56.985 --> 01:26:59.153
I was wrong to raise you
the way I did,

01:26:59.155 --> 01:27:01.288
but at least I can protect you.

01:27:01.290 --> 01:27:04.024
Nothing will happen to you.

01:27:04.026 --> 01:27:06.360
I know you thought
this was my cage.

01:27:10.766 --> 01:27:12.900
I'm scared.

01:27:54.077 --> 01:27:56.213
I have to finish this.

01:28:00.850 --> 01:28:01.849
Mom.

01:28:01.851 --> 01:28:03.051
I love you.

01:28:03.053 --> 01:28:04.886
I love you, baby.

01:28:58.578 --> 01:29:00.879
Come out, Michael.

01:34:01.489 --> 01:34:02.756
Mom.

01:34:07.697 --> 01:34:09.195
Grandmother?

01:34:13.502 --> 01:34:15.605
Grandmother?

01:34:23.212 --> 01:34:24.345
Baby.

01:34:24.347 --> 01:34:25.579
Mom.

01:34:25.581 --> 01:34:26.881
He's coming. Come on.

01:34:26.883 --> 01:34:29.350
- Shh. Come on. Come on.
- Where's Grandmother?

01:34:34.457 --> 01:34:35.790
I couldn't...
I couldn't find you guys.

01:34:35.792 --> 01:34:38.729
- Where is everybody?
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:34:53.644 --> 01:34:55.744
- It's gonna be okay.
- I'm locked in a cage.

01:34:55.746 --> 01:34:57.849
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

01:35:04.554 --> 01:35:06.321
Everything's going to be okay.

01:35:45.397 --> 01:35:46.630
Mom, I'm so sorry.

01:35:46.632 --> 01:35:48.432
I tried to stop him
from coming here.

01:36:03.449 --> 01:36:05.683
Okay. Okay.

01:36:28.875 --> 01:36:30.042
Stay back.

01:36:37.084 --> 01:36:38.919
Get back! Get back, get back.

01:36:41.021 --> 01:36:43.657
Oh, God.

01:36:48.896 --> 01:36:50.831
Stay back.

01:36:58.974 --> 01:37:00.574
Mom?

01:37:03.444 --> 01:37:05.344
Help us!

01:37:05.346 --> 01:37:07.682
I can't do it.

01:37:09.383 --> 01:37:12.621
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

01:37:15.891 --> 01:37:17.824
Gotcha.

01:37:22.831 --> 01:37:25.132
Happy Halloween, Michael.

01:37:35.577 --> 01:37:37.410
Come on, Allyson!

01:37:37.412 --> 01:37:39.146
- Come on, Allyson!
- Allyson, go!

01:37:39.148 --> 01:37:40.515
Allyson, come on!

01:37:42.084 --> 01:37:43.150
Go!

01:37:43.152 --> 01:37:45.553
Karen, come on, baby.
Come on!

01:37:47.089 --> 01:37:49.990
Oh, God!

01:37:55.131 --> 01:37:56.530
I got you!

01:37:57.533 --> 01:37:58.999
Allyson, run!

01:37:59.001 --> 01:38:01.602
Go! Go now!

01:38:01.604 --> 01:38:02.570
Come on, kick him!

01:38:02.572 --> 01:38:06.440
- Allyson! Allyson, go!
- Go!

01:38:10.413 --> 01:38:11.648
Now go!

01:38:35.139 --> 01:38:38.074
Okay. It's not a cage, baby.

01:38:40.078 --> 01:38:42.714
It's a trap.

01:38:53.725 --> 01:38:54.893
Good-bye, Michael.

01:39:52.953 --> 01:39:54.585
Oh, God, someone's coming.

01:39:54.587 --> 01:39:55.954
Someone's coming.

01:39:58.925 --> 01:40:00.225
- Hold her.
- I got her.

01:40:00.227 --> 01:40:01.659
I got her. Go!

01:40:01.661 --> 01:40:03.561
Go, baby, go!

01:40:03.563 --> 01:40:05.099
Hey!

01:40:07.969 --> 01:40:09.667
Help us.
