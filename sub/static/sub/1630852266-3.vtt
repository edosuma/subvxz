00:28.100 --> 00:31.062
I remember falling ill as a child.

00:31.062 --> 00:34.183
It's probably my earliest memory.

00:34.183 --> 00:36.423
My mother fussing over me,

00:36.423 --> 00:40.544
my father saying the healing prayer.

00:40.544 --> 00:42.704
It was the first time I had a sense

00:42.704 --> 00:46.265
of their immense,
overpowering love for me...

00:46.265 --> 00:50.147
..and the fact that I
could entice it from them.

00:51.227 --> 00:54.707
I wanted their love more than anything.

00:54.707 --> 00:58.308
I became greedy.

00:58.988 --> 01:01.430
Children remind us what we have gained

01:01.430 --> 01:04.551
but also, what we have lost.

01:04.551 --> 01:07.671
They make us come face-to-face
with our own mortality.

01:09.672 --> 01:12.193
They are the people that we once were,

01:12.193 --> 01:15.873
the land to which we can never return.

02:09.167 --> 02:10.208
No...

02:10.208 --> 02:13.127
Please...

02:16.648 --> 02:18.290
To my darling husband!

02:18.290 --> 02:19.809
Mazeltov!

02:19.809 --> 02:22.211
Mazeltov!

02:22.211 --> 02:24.130
Well, I may have been a great deal

02:24.130 --> 02:27.011
thinner in London, but I don't
think I've ever been as happy!

02:28.052 --> 02:30.333
Daniel, do you want to give
Grandfather his present?

02:30.333 --> 02:31.853
Aw.

02:31.853 --> 02:34.494
Grandfather. Ah, thank you, Daniel.

02:34.494 --> 02:37.094
Hmm, I wonder what it is.

02:40.695 --> 02:42.856
Oh, it's beautiful.

02:42.856 --> 02:44.816
Thank you, darling.

02:44.816 --> 02:46.656
Ah, good boy.

02:46.656 --> 02:49.817
Ooh, Daniel, we need a knife,
would you run and get one?

02:49.817 --> 02:51.619
Where's Clara tonight, Max?

02:51.619 --> 02:53.138
I'm sorry. She sends her apologies.

02:53.138 --> 02:56.659
Is she unwell? No.
She just had another engagement.

02:56.659 --> 02:58.780
Oh, this had been in
the diary for months.

02:58.780 --> 03:00.260
Is everything all right between you?

03:00.260 --> 03:02.380
Oh, Mother! Stop clucking, will you?

03:02.380 --> 03:06.302
It only makes him feel
important if you fuss.

03:07.943 --> 03:10.744
Max?

03:12.064 --> 03:14.905
Well, actually, er...

03:14.905 --> 03:18.825
I'm sorry to break it to you. What?

03:18.985 --> 03:21.105
Clara and I are no longer engaged, Mama.

03:21.105 --> 03:26.107
Don't be absurd. Of course you are!

03:47.112 --> 03:49.754
The invitations have all gone out.

03:49.754 --> 03:52.393
My mother's lace,

03:52.393 --> 03:55.594
the dress has been planned around it...

03:55.594 --> 03:59.316
Max, what on earth is going on?

04:01.436 --> 04:04.557
Daniel?!

04:05.837 --> 04:08.479
Daniel! Oh, my darling!

04:08.479 --> 04:10.519
Give me your handkerchief!

04:10.519 --> 04:11.838
Daniel!

04:11.838 --> 04:13.320
Daniel?

04:13.320 --> 04:14.679
Oh, my God!

04:14.679 --> 04:16.560
What were you thinking?!

04:16.560 --> 04:18.081
Daniel?

04:18.081 --> 04:21.601
Daniel?!

04:37.206 --> 04:39.846
How is he?

04:39.846 --> 04:42.126
He's lucky.

04:42.126 --> 04:43.648
The wounds weren't too deep.

04:43.648 --> 04:45.328
I don't understand.

04:45.328 --> 04:49.368
What would make him do
something like that to himself?

04:49.368 --> 04:51.210
Well done, Max.

04:51.210 --> 04:53.690
That accident could have
been a great deal worse.

04:53.690 --> 04:56.370
It wasn't an accident.
Don't be ridiculous.

04:56.370 --> 04:59.931
It won't help Daniel
to pretend that it was.

04:59.931 --> 05:03.052
I've seen cases of self-harm before.

05:03.052 --> 05:05.093
Don't talk like that!
He's not a patient.

05:05.093 --> 05:07.974
He's deeply disturbed, Mama.

05:07.974 --> 05:12.975
No use in pretending otherwise.

05:13.735 --> 05:18.577
Oh, my God!

05:18.736 --> 05:20.817
Papa!

05:21.177 --> 05:22.898
Max!

05:23.218 --> 05:27.818
They came to live with us in
Vienna when Daniel's father died.

05:28.019 --> 05:32.701
He was a soldier. Killed in action.

05:32.701 --> 05:36.621
So, Daniel was brought up in Austria.

05:36.621 --> 05:38.421
My sister decided to send him

05:38.421 --> 05:42.622
to St Florian's, the military academy.

05:42.622 --> 05:47.624
I would like you to come
to the school with me.

06:11.870 --> 06:14.511
What is it?

06:14.511 --> 06:16.672
What do they call it?

06:16.672 --> 06:21.312
"The happiest days of your life"!

06:21.312 --> 06:24.313
Julius Reisinger, headmaster,

06:24.313 --> 06:26.355
and this is my deputy, Mr Becker.

06:26.355 --> 06:28.795
Max Liebermann. I'm Daniel's uncle.

06:28.795 --> 06:30.716
This is my colleague,
Inspector Rheinhardt.

06:30.716 --> 06:32.635
Police Department, Leopoldstadt.

06:32.635 --> 06:36.037
So, what is this about?

06:36.037 --> 06:38.678
Why have you brought the police here?

06:38.678 --> 06:42.239
My nephew was the victim of a
serious attack, Herr Reisinger.

06:42.239 --> 06:45.319
He has a pattern of cuts and
bruises all across his body.

06:45.319 --> 06:47.600
I came here on behalf of my sister.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.121
She demands to know who's responsible.

06:50.121 --> 06:55.122
St Florian's is a military academy.

06:56.321 --> 06:59.522
The boys are all trained to fight.

06:59.522 --> 07:02.403
It's a very physical education.

07:02.403 --> 07:05.365
Naturally, there will be
scars from time to time.

07:05.365 --> 07:07.404
This was no accident.

07:07.404 --> 07:09.845
He was deliberately set upon.

07:09.845 --> 07:13.646
May we speak with the boys in his class?

07:13.646 --> 07:15.446
I'm sorry, not without
parental permission.

07:15.446 --> 07:17.128
The family has complained.

07:17.128 --> 07:20.929
This is an official inquiry.
I must insist.

07:20.929 --> 07:25.649
Daniel won't be returning
until we get some answers.

07:27.371 --> 07:29.051
Well...

07:29.051 --> 07:31.372
You need his things.

07:31.372 --> 07:36.373
I will fetch Mr Lang, the housemaster.

07:48.095 --> 07:50.017
Bright lad.

07:50.017 --> 07:52.096
Bright future.

07:52.096 --> 07:55.698
Do you teach Daniel? Calligraphy.

07:55.698 --> 07:58.819
I'm an artist,
but art isn't on the curriculum.

07:58.819 --> 08:03.820
Not appropriate for the military.

08:05.621 --> 08:07.581
Gentlemen?

08:08.741 --> 08:10.901
Excuse me, sir.

08:10.901 --> 08:13.302
I need to be excused from drill.

08:13.302 --> 08:15.302
Anything in particular?

08:15.302 --> 08:19.543
Or shall I just use my imagination?

08:19.543 --> 08:23.304
There you go.

08:23.304 --> 08:26.425
Boys are sent here for
all manner of reasons.

08:26.425 --> 08:28.827
Usually because someone
in the family served,

08:28.827 --> 08:32.707
sometimes because they're
growing up "too delicate".

08:32.707 --> 08:35.587
You're not impressed by the philosophy?

08:35.587 --> 08:37.469
Don't I seem impressed?

08:37.469 --> 08:39.990
Well, you're the only member
of staff not in uniform.

08:39.990 --> 08:41.470
Most of the staff were wounded

08:41.470 --> 08:45.231
in action, careers cut short.

08:45.231 --> 08:47.671
So, they live their lives
through the younger men?

08:47.671 --> 08:52.672
Yes, exactly, Doctor.

09:10.917 --> 09:14.399
When a child is born, it's perfect.

09:14.399 --> 09:18.360
Nothing corrupted, nothing tainted.

09:19.240 --> 09:22.840
What the hell happened to make
him do something like this?

09:30.003 --> 09:35.004
Inspector! Herr Becker.

09:45.287 --> 09:47.367
You run the sick bay, too?

09:47.367 --> 09:49.967
I was in the Army Medical Corps.

09:49.967 --> 09:54.968
I teach the boys chemistry and biology.

09:54.968 --> 09:58.729
Did Daniel ever come
to you for any reason?

09:58.729 --> 10:03.531
Such as? Unhappiness?

10:03.531 --> 10:05.691
Did he want someone to talk to?

10:05.691 --> 10:08.452
I trained as a medical doctor, not a...

10:08.452 --> 10:13.453
What's the word?

10:15.213 --> 10:17.694
Um, Freudian.

10:17.694 --> 10:22.695
I think that's what
they're calling it in Vienna.

10:36.219 --> 10:39.100
Who occupied this bed next
to Daniel's? Thomas Zelenka.

10:39.100 --> 10:41.781
Well, did he leave the school?

10:41.781 --> 10:46.783
There was an accident. He died.

10:55.584 --> 10:57.345
They found his body in the river,

10:57.345 --> 11:00.026
at the bottom of the ravine.

11:00.026 --> 11:03.626
Playing daredevil games,
slipped and drowned.

11:03.626 --> 11:05.788
Boys have been caught
going out to the grounds

11:05.788 --> 11:09.669
from time to time.
A midnight adventure gone wrong.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.029
Found at dawn by the groundsman.

11:12.029 --> 11:14.670
Been in the water all night.

11:14.670 --> 11:18.630
When was this? Ten days ago. Dear God.

11:19.311 --> 11:21.471
But did anyone talk to
the boys afterwards?

11:21.471 --> 11:24.872
"Talk"? They're supposed
to be in training.

11:24.872 --> 11:28.593
Exposure to death is an asset.

11:31.754 --> 11:33.474
They tried to erase his name.

11:33.474 --> 11:38.156
What? Here, at the bedpost.

11:49.199 --> 11:52.440
Daniel was trying to restore it.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.720
The name...

11:54.720 --> 11:56.640
Zelenka.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.081
A "Z"...

11:58.081 --> 11:59.121
That's what Daniel

11:59.121 --> 12:03.683
was cutting into his arm!

12:26.689 --> 12:30.969
Tell the groundsman not to let
them through the gates again.

12:30.969 --> 12:34.051
But if they bring a warrant? They won't.

12:34.051 --> 12:39.011
We have friends at
the Police Department.

12:44.454 --> 12:47.253
Daniel, this is my friend, Oskar.

12:47.253 --> 12:50.654
He's a policeman.

12:50.654 --> 12:54.015
He's agreed to help us, but I
need you to tell him what happened.

12:54.015 --> 12:59.016
We went to your school today.

13:05.339 --> 13:09.420
We went to your school today.

13:09.700 --> 13:14.701
We spoke to your housemaster.

13:21.463 --> 13:23.824
What are these numbers, Daniel?

13:25.224 --> 13:26.864
Are they a code?

13:29.105 --> 13:31.385
I used to make up codes
when I was your age.

13:34.746 --> 13:37.547
I wanted to ask you about the
boy in the bed next to yours.

13:39.387 --> 13:41.308
Thomas Zelenka?

13:43.748 --> 13:45.749
I heard what happened to him.

13:48.629 --> 13:50.431
Was he a friend of yours?

13:51.071 --> 13:53.911
Oh, God, give me clean hands,
clean words, clean thoughts,

13:53.911 --> 13:57.031
and help me to stand for the
hard right against the easy wrong.

13:57.031 --> 13:59.193
Daniel? Forgive me when
I am unkind to others

13:59.193 --> 14:02.074
and help me to forgive those
who are unkind to me... Daniel?

14:02.074 --> 14:04.714
Lend me the chance to do
a little good each day...

14:04.714 --> 14:07.355
Daniel, what, is it? Daniel!
Oh, God, give me clean hands,

14:07.355 --> 14:09.515
clean words, clean thoughts...
It's all right, Daniel, stop...

14:09.515 --> 14:11.675
Forgive me when I am unkind to others

14:11.675 --> 14:14.237
and help me to forgive
those who are unkind...!

14:17.797 --> 14:19.318
I'm sorry! Daniel!

14:19.318 --> 14:21.559
I'm sorry! Stop!

14:21.559 --> 14:23.398
I'm sorry! Daniel, stop it!

14:23.398 --> 14:26.039
I'm sorry...

14:47.846 --> 14:50.165
Zelenka. Pupil at St Florian's.

14:50.165 --> 14:51.646
You were the investigating officer?

14:55.007 --> 14:56.927
Mm.

14:56.927 --> 14:58.449
Tragic case.

14:58.449 --> 15:01.008
Poor boy was 16.

15:01.008 --> 15:04.490
Why are you looking
through my case files?

15:04.490 --> 15:06.810
Seems remarkably thin.

15:06.810 --> 15:08.331
It was an accident.

15:08.331 --> 15:10.332
No arrests necessary.

15:10.332 --> 15:13.171
The Commissioner is asking
for you, both of you.

15:13.171 --> 15:16.412
Gentlemen?

15:16.692 --> 15:19.454
There is something I need to tell both.

15:19.454 --> 15:22.735
This isn't official.
It will be announced next week.

15:22.735 --> 15:25.496
I've been offered Lechner's job.

15:25.496 --> 15:27.935
I'm going to be the
next Chief of Police.

15:27.935 --> 15:30.696
Congratulations, sir! Well done.

15:30.696 --> 15:35.218
Yes, congratulations. Thank you.
I shall miss this place,

15:35.218 --> 15:38.499
but greatness beckons.

15:38.499 --> 15:40.500
Do they know who's taking your job, sir?

15:40.500 --> 15:44.019
As far as I'm concerned,
I'd like it to be one of our own.

15:44.019 --> 15:46.221
You are the two most senior officers.

15:46.221 --> 15:49.342
You should see to it that you
impress over the coming weeks.

15:49.342 --> 15:53.263
That's all.

16:03.304 --> 16:05.746
"Do they know who's taking your job?"

16:05.746 --> 16:08.826
Never miss an opportunity, do you?

16:08.826 --> 16:10.988
Time for you to invest in a new suit.

16:10.988 --> 16:13.388
That one won't get you
a job as a rat-catcher.

16:13.388 --> 16:14.707
It's not a beauty pageant.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.349
You'd better hope not!

16:50.557 --> 16:53.078
Hello, Oskar.

16:53.078 --> 16:55.958
Hello.

16:58.719 --> 17:01.960
I've been in Vienna for a week now.

17:02.761 --> 17:05.961
Where have you been staying?

17:05.961 --> 17:09.042
My sister.

17:10.002 --> 17:11.883
I...

17:11.883 --> 17:15.084
I didn't know how it
would be between us.

17:18.284 --> 17:22.285
So, I read about you in the papers.

17:22.285 --> 17:25.445
Made a name for yourself.

17:30.568 --> 17:33.248
Work is what I have in my life now.

17:34.968 --> 17:38.370
Work is everything.

17:50.773 --> 17:53.094
Have you been to the grave?

17:53.854 --> 17:57.855
Have you seen her?

17:57.855 --> 18:01.656
Oskar, please.

18:01.976 --> 18:06.378
Everyone copes in their own way.

18:06.378 --> 18:08.017
Some do it by staying.

18:08.017 --> 18:11.179
Some do it by running away.

18:20.020 --> 18:23.301
I'm sorry.

18:24.102 --> 18:26.583
You don't deserve that.

18:37.945 --> 18:40.907
Well? Two men. I saw them with Lang.

18:40.907 --> 18:43.546
One of them was a policeman.
How can you be sure?

18:43.546 --> 18:44.947
They called him "Inspector".

18:44.947 --> 18:49.948
I'm not a complete idiot, Drexler!
If they discover... No!

18:51.349 --> 18:54.269
We carry on.

18:54.830 --> 18:56.831
No-one says a thing.

19:20.036 --> 19:21.476
You remember when I was little,

19:21.476 --> 19:24.158
you taught me how to write in code?

19:24.158 --> 19:26.318
Leah and I used to write
each other messages.

19:26.318 --> 19:30.719
Did you teach Daniel, too?
Yes. Yes, I think so.

19:31.319 --> 19:34.201
First number is the line on
the first page of the book,

19:34.201 --> 19:37.000
the second number is the
letter, counting across.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.922
But you have to know the specific book

19:38.922 --> 19:42.083
in order to decipher it.
Did Daniel write this?

19:42.083 --> 19:45.283
I'm just trying to
understand him as best I can.

19:50.964 --> 19:52.926
The world has turned upside down.

19:52.926 --> 19:57.607
Not so long ago, we were a happy family.

19:57.607 --> 20:00.407
So, you came in here
to talk about Clara.

20:00.407 --> 20:03.208
Your mother and I, we don't
understand what's happening.

20:03.208 --> 20:06.288
Some people are just
not meant to be together.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.890
That's not an answer.
That's a line from a romantic novel.

20:08.890 --> 20:10.410
Father.

20:10.410 --> 20:13.330
We care about you... both.

20:13.330 --> 20:16.251
Think about your future, my son.
You stood in this house

20:16.251 --> 20:18.692
and signed a contract
before God. Of course

20:18.692 --> 20:20.933
Everything must be viewed
as a business transaction!

20:20.933 --> 20:24.293
Max...! I'm not in love with her!

20:24.293 --> 20:27.615
I thought I was.

20:27.615 --> 20:31.096
I'd convinced myself.

20:31.975 --> 20:35.457
Are you sure you know what love is?

20:35.457 --> 20:37.897
Perhaps you're looking for
something that doesn't exist.

20:37.897 --> 20:39.577
Father, please...

20:39.577 --> 20:43.338
What if there is no blinding
light, no fairy-tale ending?

20:43.338 --> 20:47.299
Just two people willing
to grow old together.

20:47.299 --> 20:50.260
There are worse ways to live.

20:50.260 --> 20:51.861
Please, my son,

20:51.861 --> 20:54.981
just think about it.

21:09.626 --> 21:14.306
You told them? Well,
I couldn't keep it from them.

21:14.467 --> 21:16.387
My mother plans her
days around the wedding.

21:16.387 --> 21:18.827
She can barely think or
talk about anything else.

21:18.827 --> 21:21.669
Suddenly makes it so real. I know.

21:21.669 --> 21:26.670
I should have spoken to
you about it. I'm sorry.

21:33.831 --> 21:35.991
Did you give them a reason?

21:36.633 --> 21:40.954
We both know. Oh, and what's that?

21:40.954 --> 21:44.915
That I can't love you as
much as you need to be loved.

21:45.354 --> 21:48.355
Did you tell them there's someone else?

21:49.236 --> 21:51.156
I honestly don't know
what I feel, Clara.

21:51.156 --> 21:53.477
So, what are we to do now?

21:53.477 --> 21:55.638
Wait until your feelings
have become clearer?!

21:55.638 --> 21:57.837
I don't want to make
this painful for you...

21:57.837 --> 22:02.399
It's a little late to
worry about that, Max!

22:12.601 --> 22:14.842
Goodbye, Max.

22:30.967 --> 22:32.647
I think I recall the case, yes.

22:34.367 --> 22:36.488
Drowned. Lungs flooded with water.

22:37.449 --> 22:40.489
Evidence of a sharp blow to the head.

22:40.489 --> 22:45.211
Most likely he slipped and fell.

22:45.211 --> 22:47.570
Where's the postmortem?

22:47.570 --> 22:49.611
There was no examination.

22:49.611 --> 22:52.812
It was obviously just a tragic accident.

22:52.812 --> 22:54.973
Well, surely the blow could
have been inflicted first,

22:54.973 --> 22:56.734
before the body entered the water?

22:56.734 --> 22:59.813
I do know how to do my job, Doctor.

22:59.813 --> 23:01.735
Doctor Liebermann didn't
mean to imply that you...

23:01.735 --> 23:03.895
Yes, well, actually I did!

23:03.895 --> 23:07.977
Well?

23:07.977 --> 23:11.817
Such a wound would have
bled more profusely,

23:11.817 --> 23:13.898
or maybe even healed in the night air.

23:13.898 --> 23:16.298
Yes, but if he'd been
in the water all night

23:16.298 --> 23:17.739
it would be difficult to tell.

23:17.739 --> 23:19.179
You were duty-bound to examine him.

23:19.179 --> 23:21.579
Is there somewhere you
have to go to learn this?

23:21.579 --> 23:22.779
Learn what? Your superior manner.

23:22.779 --> 23:24.820
No, it comes quite naturally to him.

23:24.820 --> 23:27.262
You get used to it.

23:27.262 --> 23:30.541
No, actually, you don't.

23:30.541 --> 23:33.503
Well, if you'd both excuse me.

23:33.503 --> 23:36.063
Why would someone feel
guilt about his death -

23:36.063 --> 23:37.984
unless they'd caused it?

23:37.984 --> 23:41.225
Guilt doesn't leave a physical scar.

23:41.225 --> 23:46.025
You are the neurologist.

23:47.907 --> 23:51.188
Well, you haven't lost
your ability to irritate.

23:51.587 --> 23:54.709
I need to know why
Daniel feels responsible.

23:54.709 --> 23:57.910
It says here the body's
still in the morgue.

24:31.918 --> 24:33.439
When we visited the school before,

24:33.439 --> 24:37.639
there was a boy with a mark on his hand.

24:37.639 --> 24:42.640
Thomas Zelenka.

24:43.922 --> 24:46.442
The exact same mark.

24:46.442 --> 24:48.243
It's an identical wound.

24:48.243 --> 24:51.403
What happened?

24:51.403 --> 24:54.323
Help us, please.

24:54.323 --> 24:56.404
You're the only one who can.

24:56.404 --> 25:00.565
I don't know what you're talking about.

25:00.565 --> 25:04.687
I think you know
exactly what's going on.

25:08.567 --> 25:11.648
It happened before.

25:13.729 --> 25:15.809
When I first came here.

25:18.330 --> 25:20.850
Boys playing pernicious games.

25:21.972 --> 25:25.733
I thought I'd put a stop to it.

25:27.852 --> 25:30.413
But...

25:30.653 --> 25:34.334
..you can't ever stop it.

25:34.334 --> 25:35.814
There's something evil

25:35.814 --> 25:37.976
in this institution,

25:37.976 --> 25:42.777
a ritual passed between the generations.

27:27.244 --> 27:31.005
Tell us about Zelenka. His last day.

27:31.364 --> 27:34.445
Just like any other.

27:34.445 --> 27:35.926
Morning chapel.

27:35.926 --> 27:38.686
Studies before lunch. And after?

27:38.686 --> 27:40.647
He was excused from military drill.

27:40.647 --> 27:42.728
He wasn't tough like the other boys,

27:42.728 --> 27:46.209
so I allowed him to work alone.

27:46.769 --> 27:49.129
Dinner at six,

27:49.129 --> 27:52.370
evening prayers, lights out.

27:52.370 --> 27:54.291
He must have slipped
out of the dormitory

27:54.291 --> 27:55.772
when everyone was sleeping.

27:55.772 --> 27:57.371
I think he ran away

27:57.371 --> 27:59.692
because he was tortured in that room.

27:59.692 --> 28:03.214
Because he was
different from the others.

28:03.214 --> 28:06.093
You have no right to
question me about my methods!

28:06.093 --> 28:07.614
We've uncovered a pattern of violence

28:07.614 --> 28:10.895
at St Florian's. You didn't investigate.

28:10.895 --> 28:13.056
A boy was tortured and
you turned your back!

28:13.056 --> 28:14.096
This is absurd!

28:14.096 --> 28:17.978
You were a pupil.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.579
You were a pupil.

28:21.579 --> 28:23.499
I saw your name in the trophy cabinet.

28:23.499 --> 28:26.659
How long has it been
going on? How many years?

28:26.659 --> 28:29.541
Did you see to it that
there was no postmortem?

28:29.541 --> 28:31.981
Now, wait...! Wait a moment!

28:31.981 --> 28:33.542
If you are suggesting...!

28:33.542 --> 28:35.222
We're going back into the Zelenka case,

28:35.222 --> 28:37.783
interviewing all the witnesses
you should have spoken to.

28:37.783 --> 28:39.343
And if we find something...

28:39.343 --> 28:44.264
Well, you can kiss
goodbye to that promotion.

28:50.385 --> 28:52.626
Do you have to enjoy it quite so much?

28:53.106 --> 28:56.268
Enjoy what? Making him squirm.

28:56.268 --> 28:59.028
You were enjoying it, too.

28:59.028 --> 29:01.269
I suppose.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.639
Max, your mind is on something else.

29:44.639 --> 29:47.001
What happened? Something's wrong.

29:47.001 --> 29:48.841
It's not only the boy.

29:48.841 --> 29:50.562
What?

29:50.562 --> 29:52.802
Tell me, please?

29:52.802 --> 29:54.922
Well, I suppose you'll
find out soon enough.

29:54.922 --> 29:59.604
Everybody knows everyone's
business in Vienna.

29:59.604 --> 30:01.565
Clara and I -

30:01.565 --> 30:04.565
we're no longer engaged.

30:04.565 --> 30:05.846
Oh.

30:05.846 --> 30:08.246
I'm sorry.

30:08.246 --> 30:10.047
I liked her.

30:10.047 --> 30:11.327
Yes, well, you're not Jewish.

30:11.327 --> 30:16.008
A broken engagement is like...

30:16.008 --> 30:17.049
The sky has fallen?

30:17.049 --> 30:22.050
Yes, something like that...

30:27.410 --> 30:31.451
What happened between you,
if you don't mind me asking?

30:31.451 --> 30:32.492
Always interrogating, aren't you?

30:32.492 --> 30:35.774
Well, it's my job.

30:35.774 --> 30:39.654
Is there somebody else involved?

30:39.654 --> 30:43.935
Why would you ask that?

30:43.935 --> 30:44.975
Ah, there is.

30:44.975 --> 30:46.695
I thought so.

30:46.695 --> 30:48.736
You're not the only
observer of human behaviour.

30:48.736 --> 30:49.777
Stop smiling.

30:49.777 --> 30:52.897
I wasn't smiling.

30:52.897 --> 30:57.898
Yes, you were trying hard not to.

31:04.541 --> 31:05.581
Doctor Max Liebermann,

31:05.581 --> 31:07.461
expert in the inner
workings of the mind...

31:07.461 --> 31:12.462
..except his own.

31:40.350 --> 31:43.311
I asked you not to
come here. Yes, I know.

31:43.311 --> 31:47.231
I had to.

31:47.231 --> 31:49.192
Well, I would be grateful if you'd say

31:49.192 --> 31:52.314
what you need to say and then go.

31:52.314 --> 31:53.874
How are things going here at...?

31:53.874 --> 31:57.395
You didn't come here to
make polite conversation.

31:57.395 --> 32:02.396
Amelia... Please,
let's not dance around each other.

32:03.155 --> 32:05.996
I came here to tell you...

32:05.996 --> 32:10.997
..that Clara and I
are no longer engaged.

32:11.599 --> 32:14.319
I see.

32:14.319 --> 32:16.479
Anything else?

32:16.479 --> 32:21.480
Yes, actually.

32:22.440 --> 32:25.882
I'm in love with you.

32:25.882 --> 32:28.283
Really?

32:28.283 --> 32:32.044
Well, I can recommend an
article in The Science Journal.

32:32.044 --> 32:36.645
Love is just a chemical.
It... It will explain.

32:36.645 --> 32:39.046
Was there anything else you
wanted to discuss, or is...

32:39.046 --> 32:42.006
..is that all you came to talk about?

32:42.006 --> 32:45.367
I want to kiss you.

32:45.367 --> 32:50.369
Or is there a chemical
substitute for that, as well?

32:52.809 --> 32:57.770
Max...

33:02.451 --> 33:04.251
Um, um...

33:04.251 --> 33:09.253
I really must be going.
Yes! Yes. Of course.

33:45.903 --> 33:48.543
Stoikjavic?

33:48.543 --> 33:51.905
Wake up!

33:51.905 --> 33:55.225
Stoikjavic...

33:55.225 --> 34:00.226
..get dressed.

34:20.312 --> 34:25.274
Go on.

34:40.797 --> 34:45.799
Go on.

34:46.719 --> 34:51.679
Move.

34:55.561 --> 35:00.562
It's your duty.

35:24.128 --> 35:29.129
Oh, stop crying!

35:31.090 --> 35:35.611
Thank you.

35:44.774 --> 35:46.654
Why would he come out here all alone

35:46.654 --> 35:48.494
in the middle of the night?

35:48.494 --> 35:52.135
Boys don't tend to have
adventures all alone.

35:52.135 --> 35:57.137
Who was with him?

35:58.338 --> 36:00.218
Unless...

36:00.218 --> 36:03.819
He was running.

36:03.819 --> 36:06.940
He was trying to escape from someone.

36:06.940 --> 36:09.700
He was being hunted.

36:09.700 --> 36:12.581
We need to speak to Zelenka's family.

36:12.581 --> 36:15.701
My parents were in America.

36:15.701 --> 36:17.982
They are travelling home...

36:17.982 --> 36:21.264
..for the funeral.

36:21.264 --> 36:25.225
An officer came to my home.

36:25.225 --> 36:28.786
He told me that Thomas was dead.

36:28.786 --> 36:33.787
I had to go alone, to the morgue.

36:34.907 --> 36:39.869
16 years old.

36:39.869 --> 36:41.789
My brother was gentle, not strong.

36:41.789 --> 36:46.791
Not at all like a soldier.

36:51.312 --> 36:52.752
Did he ever talk about school?

36:52.752 --> 36:55.873
Did he ever complain
about the treatment there?

36:55.873 --> 36:57.072
He was a good boy.

36:57.072 --> 37:02.074
He wanted to make us all proud of him.

37:13.677 --> 37:16.677
There is one thing,
if you are going to the school?

37:16.677 --> 37:19.399
Yes?

37:19.399 --> 37:23.800
He was a very fine painter.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.921
He was working on a portrait in lessons.

37:25.921 --> 37:28.481
We would like it returned, please.

37:28.481 --> 37:31.601
Something to help us remember.

37:31.601 --> 37:34.883
Of course.

37:59.569 --> 38:01.209
I don't understand.

38:01.209 --> 38:02.850
What's happening, Max?

38:02.850 --> 38:04.851
Please, try not to worry.

38:04.851 --> 38:08.091
There'll be a reason for his behaviour.

38:08.091 --> 38:09.772
No matter how illogical it might seem,

38:09.772 --> 38:12.453
there'll be a rational motive
and we'll find it, Leah,

38:12.453 --> 38:15.173
but Daniel needs to communicate.

38:15.173 --> 38:20.174
Encourage him to paint or draw.

38:20.935 --> 38:25.937
Thomas wanted to run away
and I think you know why.

38:28.977 --> 38:32.617
I think whoever hurt him hurt you, too.

38:32.617 --> 38:37.619
I think you're unhappy because
you couldn't tell anyone about it.

38:59.544 --> 39:01.705
I know there's a lot you want to say.

39:01.705 --> 39:04.105
But I know that it's
painful for you to talk.

39:04.105 --> 39:07.666
So...

39:07.666 --> 39:12.429
..Thomas gave me the idea.

39:12.429 --> 39:17.430
I thought we might paint.

39:36.594 --> 39:41.595
What can you see?

39:45.917 --> 39:48.318
Wolf.

39:48.318 --> 39:52.598
A wolf.

39:52.598 --> 39:53.638
A warrant?

39:53.638 --> 39:57.159
We have sufficient evidence
to interview the boys.

39:57.159 --> 39:59.321
You don't think you're
making too much of this?

39:59.321 --> 40:01.040
Childish pranks? No.

40:01.040 --> 40:04.121
No, sir.

40:04.121 --> 40:07.682
A boy died.

40:07.682 --> 40:12.563
Tread carefully.

41:04.498 --> 41:07.339
Do you know our reputation, Inspector?

41:07.339 --> 41:09.258
Some of the most
important men in Austria

41:09.258 --> 41:12.259
educate their sons here.

41:12.259 --> 41:14.421
Your reputation isn't my concern.

41:18.181 --> 41:23.182
Now get out of my way or
I'll have you arrested!

41:24.823 --> 41:29.344
Is that your idea of treading carefully?

41:29.344 --> 41:30.505
Stefan Wolf?

41:30.505 --> 41:34.546
That's your name?

41:34.546 --> 41:36.225
You know Thomas Zelenka?

41:36.225 --> 41:37.467
What's this about?

41:37.467 --> 41:42.468
Just answer the question, please.

41:42.868 --> 41:47.389
You do know my father's
a general in the Army?

41:47.389 --> 41:52.390
Ah... and that affects your
ability to remember names?

41:53.150 --> 41:54.351
I didn't know him.

41:54.351 --> 41:55.790
But he was in your platoon.

41:55.790 --> 42:00.592
In your dormitory.

42:00.592 --> 42:02.712
I don't know everyone by name.

42:02.712 --> 42:05.273
Well, he died.

42:05.273 --> 42:08.194
Does a drowned corpse jog your memory?

42:08.194 --> 42:12.675
We weren't that close.
And why is that, Stefan?

42:12.675 --> 42:17.557
Did you think he was somehow different?

42:17.557 --> 42:19.717
He was a lousy soldier.

42:19.717 --> 42:21.878
And you didn't mix with the weak ones?

42:21.878 --> 42:25.319
See, I mix with whomever I choose.

42:25.319 --> 42:26.839
Is it any of your business?

42:26.839 --> 42:29.400
I'll tell you what is my business -

42:29.400 --> 42:33.160
torturing a boy who you
thought was inferior.

42:33.160 --> 42:34.562
That's a serious allegation.

42:34.562 --> 42:38.403
Thomas Zelenka had a
scorch mark on his hand.

42:38.403 --> 42:41.483
He was careless with candles.

42:41.483 --> 42:45.404
Someone scorched his
hand with a coin, Stefan.

42:45.404 --> 42:47.565
They heated the coin
up over a candle flame

42:47.565 --> 42:49.966
and then they made him
clutch it in his palm

42:49.966 --> 42:51.165
until the flesh burnt away.

42:51.165 --> 42:53.566
What sort of a boy would
do something like that?

42:53.566 --> 42:56.206
If anyone said it was me,
they were a damned liar!

42:56.206 --> 43:00.127
No-one's accusing you.

43:00.127 --> 43:02.529
Some of the boys are weak.
They don't fit in.

43:02.529 --> 43:07.530
But I'm not to blame.

43:15.412 --> 43:18.092
We need someone to name him.

43:18.092 --> 43:21.293
It'll never happen.

43:21.293 --> 43:24.614
They all stick together, close ranks.

43:24.614 --> 43:28.976
You can't break them.

43:28.976 --> 43:33.977
Silence is our weapon.

43:41.859 --> 43:46.860
I don't understand why I'm here.

43:47.421 --> 43:52.422
What exactly do you want me to say?

43:55.302 --> 43:59.143
What?!

43:59.143 --> 44:03.824
You think I've done something wrong?

44:03.824 --> 44:08.105
Why don't you tell me
why you asked me here?

44:08.105 --> 44:13.106
My father's an ambassador.

44:16.508 --> 44:19.909
I stole a pastry once, yes.

44:19.909 --> 44:24.910
Is that what this is about?

44:25.309 --> 44:30.311
The strudel?

44:31.231 --> 44:35.632
How long am I going to be here?

44:35.632 --> 44:40.633
How long am I going to
be kept sitting around?

44:43.754 --> 44:47.996
All right.

44:47.996 --> 44:50.716
I found it tucked behind his locker.

44:50.716 --> 44:52.878
I get ill, you see.

44:52.878 --> 44:55.277
I often stay back during drill.

44:55.277 --> 44:57.599
Sometimes I...

44:57.599 --> 45:00.480
..just... look around.

45:00.480 --> 45:02.199
You steal things?

45:02.199 --> 45:05.401
Not steal.

45:05.401 --> 45:10.402
I put the letter back where I found it.

45:10.801 --> 45:14.162
But you remember what it said?

45:14.162 --> 45:17.723
It said that they were
going to run away together.

45:17.723 --> 45:21.244
"They"?

45:21.244 --> 45:24.325
The words he used... He
was in love with someone.

45:24.325 --> 45:27.126
Smitten. They were going to run away,

45:27.126 --> 45:28.927
and then they would tell the world

45:28.927 --> 45:31.368
what was going on at St Florian's.

45:31.368 --> 45:34.648
"What's going on"...?

45:34.648 --> 45:38.689
Who was it from, this letter?

45:38.689 --> 45:40.970
Zelenka.

45:40.970 --> 45:43.371
It was his locker.

45:43.371 --> 45:47.052
And who did he write it to?

45:47.052 --> 45:48.691
I don't know.

45:48.691 --> 45:53.693
It just said... "Beloved".

45:59.455 --> 46:02.576
They're schoolboys, not murderers.

46:02.576 --> 46:04.655
Have you ever seen dogs hunt?

46:04.655 --> 46:09.297
As soon as they're in a pack,
their whole mentality changes.

46:09.297 --> 46:12.418
You really think that's what happened?

46:12.418 --> 46:14.298
Zelenka was going to run away.

46:14.298 --> 46:16.900
He was going to tell the
world about his tormentors.

46:16.900 --> 46:20.100
So, somebody stopped him.

46:20.100 --> 46:24.861
We've stumbled into a
murder investigation.

46:24.861 --> 46:29.862
Welcome to the case, Inspector.

46:36.425 --> 46:37.864
Classic case of delusion.

46:37.864 --> 46:40.586
Fascinating patient.
Which one of you would like to conduct

46:40.586 --> 46:44.866
the preliminary examination?

46:44.866 --> 46:47.428
Very well.

46:47.428 --> 46:51.748
Dismissed.

46:51.748 --> 46:52.788
Liebermann?

46:52.788 --> 46:54.228
You're distracted.
Something on your mind?

46:54.228 --> 46:55.269
No, nothing, sir.

46:55.269 --> 46:57.149
Nothing?

46:57.149 --> 47:01.670
What's the nature of your research?
It's a private patient.

47:01.670 --> 47:04.791
Nonsense! You don't have
private patients. What's the name?

47:04.791 --> 47:09.792
If you're working on a case,
then I wish to be kept informed.

47:09.994 --> 47:13.074
Kindly submit a case report.

47:13.074 --> 47:18.076
Yes, sir.

47:19.875 --> 47:21.557
What do you boys want?

47:21.557 --> 47:23.557
You told them.

47:23.557 --> 47:26.197
You gave them our names.

47:26.197 --> 47:28.918
I don't know what you mean.

47:28.918 --> 47:33.239
You took them to the
place in the cellar.

47:33.239 --> 47:35.440
They already knew.

47:35.440 --> 47:40.441
And now, get out of my way!

47:41.881 --> 47:44.963
You've been making up a
lot of stories, Master.

47:44.963 --> 47:47.523
See, we can make up stories, too.

47:47.523 --> 47:52.525
We're all very good at creative writing.

47:57.606 --> 48:01.487
Bauer's going to make up a
story, on how you hurt him.

48:01.487 --> 48:05.727
You conniving bastard!

48:05.727 --> 48:09.529
You can't kill a rumour.

48:09.529 --> 48:11.490
It's like a...

48:11.490 --> 48:14.450
It's like a hydra.

48:14.450 --> 48:16.770
You cut off one head,

48:16.770 --> 48:20.452
two others grow back in its place.

48:51.020 --> 48:52.540
It's dust.

48:52.540 --> 48:55.101
Amelia!

48:55.101 --> 48:58.901
What you're looking at
- prehistoric samples.

48:58.901 --> 49:03.182
But you're not here to discuss my work.

49:03.182 --> 49:04.783
Well...

49:04.783 --> 49:09.784
Actually, I am.

49:11.585 --> 49:16.467
I need to know the story
of his last few hours.

49:16.467 --> 49:19.746
Why come to me?

49:19.746 --> 49:22.347
Well, you can tell
the story of a specimen

49:22.347 --> 49:25.629
when it's been buried in
the earth for centuries.

49:25.629 --> 49:28.229
So, you can tell me what
happened to this boy.

49:28.229 --> 49:32.951
What happened on his final day.

49:32.951 --> 49:35.270
Well, it says he drowned.

49:35.270 --> 49:38.751
Water washes away most
of the useful traces.

49:38.751 --> 49:41.832
Well, the pathologist at the hospital,

49:41.832 --> 49:42.792
he's old-fashioned,

49:42.792 --> 49:43.833
his methods are out-of-date.

49:43.833 --> 49:47.675
He thinks the boy drowned.

49:47.675 --> 49:49.955
I don't.

49:49.955 --> 49:53.556
Help me prove him wrong.

49:53.556 --> 49:58.558
Help me prove that whole hospital wrong.

50:12.641 --> 50:17.643
What?

50:37.287 --> 50:41.208
What have you done?

50:41.208 --> 50:43.169
The pictures.

50:43.169 --> 50:45.130
Her dresses, her shoes.

50:45.130 --> 50:47.409
What did you do with them?

50:47.409 --> 50:50.091
I thought, perhaps,
there were other children who may...

50:50.091 --> 50:52.291
Please don't tell me
you got rid of them!

50:52.291 --> 50:54.532
I gave them to a charity. A poorhouse.

50:54.532 --> 50:56.973
Why didn't you ask me?! Oskar...

50:56.973 --> 51:01.974
Those things are all I've got
left of her! My only memories!

51:12.017 --> 51:16.698
There's a moment, every day...

51:16.698 --> 51:21.699
..when I wake up.

51:23.339 --> 51:25.899
A moment...

51:25.899 --> 51:29.820
..when I forget. Don't.

51:29.820 --> 51:32.542
You need to move on.

51:32.542 --> 51:35.183
You can't live with all the
memories still in the house,

51:35.183 --> 51:36.742
suffocating you... Don't come back here

51:36.742 --> 51:39.464
telling me what I want and what I need!

51:39.464 --> 51:43.424
Oskar, I didn't leave because of Mitzi!

51:43.424 --> 51:46.506
I left because of you,

51:46.506 --> 51:48.506
because of this.

51:48.506 --> 51:51.027
It's destroying you, Oskar.

51:51.027 --> 51:56.028
You have to let go.

52:53.603 --> 52:55.363
It's all right.

52:55.363 --> 53:00.364
Come on.

53:11.367 --> 53:16.368
I'll need to take samples.

54:31.908 --> 54:32.948
Thank you.

54:32.948 --> 54:36.869
I know it was difficult
for you, coming here again.

54:36.869 --> 54:40.511
Goodnight.

55:20.361 --> 55:24.563
Shh!

55:24.563 --> 55:28.443
How is he?

55:28.443 --> 55:33.125
God help me, I don't
recognise my own son, Max.

55:33.125 --> 55:35.646
He feels guilty. Guilt,
more than anything, changes a person.

55:35.646 --> 55:39.647
I couldn't persuade him to draw.
I know you said...

55:39.647 --> 55:43.327
It's all right.
He'll draw when he's ready.

55:43.327 --> 55:45.927
That school, they never studied art.

55:45.927 --> 55:49.769
Just calligraphy, technical drawing.

55:51.530 --> 55:54.410
Max...? I'm an artist,
but art isn't on the curriculum...

55:54.410 --> 55:56.970
He was working on a
portrait in lessons...

55:56.970 --> 55:58.811
What's the matter?

55:58.811 --> 56:03.812
Where are you going?

56:13.176 --> 56:15.375
Are you going to make this a habit?

56:21.417 --> 56:23.857
My wife.

56:23.857 --> 56:26.978
Else, Doctor Liebermann. Hello.

56:26.978 --> 56:29.939
Frau Rheinhardt. Er, forgive me.

56:29.939 --> 56:32.661
What do you want? The painting!

56:32.661 --> 56:36.981
The painting in the school,
we have to find it.

56:36.981 --> 56:39.862
Sorry, I have to go.

56:45.503 --> 56:47.423
Can you tell me what you're looking for?

56:47.423 --> 56:50.944
Be careful, Inspector!
So, where is it, the painting?

56:50.944 --> 56:53.266
His sister told us
that he was a painter.

56:53.266 --> 56:58.267
But you told us the
school doesn't teach art.

56:58.987 --> 57:00.668
Which means you taught
him privately? ..No.

57:00.668 --> 57:01.708
Careful.

57:01.708 --> 57:04.069
Please be careful.

57:04.069 --> 57:09.070
Where is it?
A canvas doesn't just suddenly vanish.

57:16.511 --> 57:19.713
Why would you need to hide it?

57:19.713 --> 57:24.714
Why would you want to keep it a secret?

57:29.195 --> 57:34.197
Don't!

57:49.201 --> 57:51.121
His last painting,

57:51.121 --> 57:55.361
your brilliant protege.

57:55.361 --> 57:56.803
Couldn't bear to destroy it,

57:56.803 --> 58:01.804
but you couldn't let anyone see it. Why?

58:08.246 --> 58:11.445
We know that girl.

58:11.445 --> 58:16.447
Remember?

58:38.774 --> 58:39.814
Fraulein?

58:39.814 --> 58:44.494
Were you expecting someone else?

58:44.494 --> 58:47.055
Herr Becker, he is...?

58:47.055 --> 58:52.056
My father.
And did you know Thomas Zelenka?

58:53.137 --> 58:55.977
The boy that died?

58:55.977 --> 58:58.739
I know his name.

58:58.739 --> 59:01.179
What's this about exactly?

59:01.179 --> 59:06.181
Fraulein, please, don't waste our time.

59:07.980 --> 59:11.341
He must have seen me hereabouts.

59:11.341 --> 59:16.342
Oh, I think you posed
for it in this room.

59:16.382 --> 59:17.543
No!

59:17.543 --> 59:19.144
Don't lie to us.

59:19.144 --> 59:21.625
That's the chair in the painting.

59:21.625 --> 59:23.665
The boy is dead.

59:23.665 --> 59:28.667
We need to know the truth.

59:30.627 --> 59:33.067
There are strict rules.

59:33.067 --> 59:38.068
I'm not allowed to
interact with the boys.

59:39.028 --> 59:44.030
I get... very lonely.

59:46.510 --> 59:48.192
And then Herr Lang approached me.

59:48.192 --> 59:53.193
He said there was a student
who wanted to paint my portrait.

59:55.913 --> 59:59.034
I was very flattered.

59:59.034 --> 01:00:02.514
Lang arranged the sessions?

01:00:02.514 --> 01:00:04.676
How often were you alone
with him together here?

01:00:04.676 --> 01:00:08.317
You and Zelenka?

01:00:08.317 --> 01:00:10.437
I can't recall.

01:00:10.437 --> 01:00:12.357
Maybe four... five times.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:25.201
Gentlemen?

01:00:26.881 --> 01:00:28.842
Great talent.

01:00:28.842 --> 01:00:31.643
So sad.

01:00:31.643 --> 01:00:34.963
Such a loss.

01:00:34.963 --> 01:00:37.165
These boys have no contact with women.

01:00:37.165 --> 01:00:39.725
This sort of thing is
only to be expected.

01:00:39.725 --> 01:00:43.005
"This sort of thing"?

01:00:43.005 --> 01:00:46.086
Youthful infatuation.

01:00:48.207 --> 01:00:50.128
A secret admirer.

01:00:50.128 --> 01:00:52.288
Well, thank you for
bringing this to my attention,

01:00:52.288 --> 01:00:57.290
but my daughter is not
involved, Inspector.

01:00:57.730 --> 01:01:00.530
Well, she must have
sat for him for hours.

01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:01.970
She knew the victim.

01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:04.852
That may be so, but it
has no bearing on the case.

01:01:04.852 --> 01:01:06.971
They were going to run away together.

01:01:16.695 --> 01:01:18.374
They were going to run away together.

01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:23.376
She's the "Beloved" in the letter.

01:01:39.261 --> 01:01:41.980
I'm sorry.

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:44.822
I understand.

01:01:44.822 --> 01:01:49.542
You have to work. No, no.

01:01:49.542 --> 01:01:54.544
I mean, I'm sorry.

01:01:55.705 --> 01:01:59.585
You were right. I...

01:01:59.585 --> 01:02:04.586
My grief...

01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:17.711
Nothing? No. No traces?

01:02:17.711 --> 01:02:20.110
If the body was in the
water for some time,

01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:22.632
then anything incriminating
would have been lost.

01:02:22.632 --> 01:02:25.753
I'm sorry. There's nothing I could find.

01:02:25.753 --> 01:02:28.634
No, thank you for coming here.

01:02:28.634 --> 01:02:33.635
I was eager to help.
Eager enough to risk seeing me again?

01:02:34.675 --> 01:02:38.316
We're scientists, Doctor.

01:02:38.316 --> 01:02:43.318
It's a language we speak.

01:02:43.597 --> 01:02:46.758
Well, you'll stay for tea.

01:02:46.758 --> 01:02:49.598
No, well... Please?
It's the least I can do.

01:02:49.598 --> 01:02:51.959
Don't worry.

01:02:51.959 --> 01:02:54.240
No prying eyes or wagging tongues.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.681
You're completely safe.

01:03:04.163 --> 01:03:07.684
Hmm, apparently,
we're expecting company.

01:03:07.684 --> 01:03:10.044
Max? What are you doing?

01:03:10.044 --> 01:03:12.044
Ah, Father, meet Miss Lydgate.

01:03:12.044 --> 01:03:14.005
Not right now. What?!

01:03:14.005 --> 01:03:16.405
Fraulein, I'm afraid I'm
going to have to ask you

01:03:16.405 --> 01:03:18.807
to leave immediately.
Miss Lydgate is a colleague of mine

01:03:18.807 --> 01:03:20.247
and I've invited her to tea!

01:03:20.247 --> 01:03:22.648
Max, why don't you do
what you're told for once?!

01:03:31.529 --> 01:03:34.371
Hello, everyone.

01:03:34.371 --> 01:03:37.451
I asked Clara here.
I wanted to talk to you both.

01:03:37.451 --> 01:03:39.772
You wanted to do some mending.

01:03:39.772 --> 01:03:41.452
I didn't know you'd be entertaining.

01:03:41.452 --> 01:03:45.854
It's a professional consultation.

01:03:45.854 --> 01:03:49.295
Well, shouldn't we all sit down?

01:03:49.295 --> 01:03:51.695
Perhaps it would be better
if I left? No, please.

01:03:51.695 --> 01:03:53.816
Stay.

01:03:53.816 --> 01:03:58.817
Er, please... Sit here.

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:15.222
Well, I see you wasted no time
in moving on with your life.

01:04:15.222 --> 01:04:17.742
Clara, please...

01:04:17.742 --> 01:04:19.462
Fraulein Lydgate...

01:04:19.462 --> 01:04:20.823
Yes.

01:04:20.823 --> 01:04:23.304
..you don't remember our first meeting?

01:04:23.304 --> 01:04:25.063
You were hysterical when we met.

01:04:25.063 --> 01:04:28.345
I carried you to an ambulance.

01:04:28.345 --> 01:04:30.104
Clara... Clara, I am so sorry...

01:04:30.104 --> 01:04:32.306
Father, your involvement
thus far has not been useful.

01:04:32.306 --> 01:04:36.667
I really must be going.
Please, forgive me.

01:04:36.667 --> 01:04:37.867
No, please... I understand you

01:04:37.867 --> 01:04:39.067
better than you think, Max.

01:04:39.067 --> 01:04:40.947
Can't resist a mystery, can you?

01:04:40.947 --> 01:04:45.389
Always drawn to an enigma. Don't.

01:04:45.389 --> 01:04:48.989
Perhaps I'm too blunt for you,
too straightforward.

01:04:48.989 --> 01:04:51.271
Well, here I go again.

01:04:51.271 --> 01:04:53.912
You can go straight to hell!

01:04:58.913 --> 01:04:59.952
Excuse me.

01:04:59.952 --> 01:05:01.714
Sorry I'm late.

01:05:01.714 --> 01:05:06.715
Clara?

01:05:28.321 --> 01:05:31.201
What the hell were you thinking?
We wanted some answers.

01:05:31.201 --> 01:05:33.362
If I'd known she was going to be here...

01:05:33.362 --> 01:05:36.002
Barely a week has passed since
you broke off your engagement

01:05:36.002 --> 01:05:38.403
and already you're prancing
around town with this other woman.

01:05:38.403 --> 01:05:40.083
Who is she? Her name's Amelia Lydgate.

01:05:40.083 --> 01:05:42.804
Is she British? Yes. She's a scientist.

01:05:42.804 --> 01:05:46.444
She works at the Museum. And?

01:05:46.444 --> 01:05:47.965
Are you going to marry her?!

01:05:47.965 --> 01:05:51.727
Well, I've only known her a month.

01:05:51.727 --> 01:05:53.966
And funnily enough,
it hasn't cropped up yet!

01:05:53.966 --> 01:05:56.487
Did you meet her at the synagogue?

01:05:56.487 --> 01:05:57.808
No, she's not Jewish. Oh!

01:05:57.808 --> 01:06:00.528
It gets better and better!

01:06:00.528 --> 01:06:03.250
I met her at the hospital.
She's a patient of mine.

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:04.290
On the ward?!

01:06:04.290 --> 01:06:05.850
Please tell me you're joking...!

01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:10.852
On the neurology ward?!

01:06:20.093 --> 01:06:21.775
I can't remember the last time

01:06:21.775 --> 01:06:26.776
we all went to the synagogue
together. Can you, Daniel?

01:06:33.057 --> 01:06:38.058
Clean hands, clean thoughts...

01:06:40.178 --> 01:06:45.180
How does he know the
school prayer? What?

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:49.782
St Florian's. The Christian
prayer, I heard him recite it.

01:06:49.782 --> 01:06:54.622
Well, does he attend chapel?
No, of course not.

01:06:54.622 --> 01:06:56.864
But he knows it by heart.

01:06:56.864 --> 01:07:01.385
Well, he must have learned it.

01:07:01.385 --> 01:07:05.826
All the boys would
know it, I suppose. Why?

01:07:05.826 --> 01:07:09.106
They never need to
stare at the prayer book.

01:07:09.106 --> 01:07:14.107
Just comes to each of them naturally.

01:07:17.628 --> 01:07:19.629
I tried every book I could find.

01:07:19.629 --> 01:07:22.230
The Bible, Daniel's school dictionary.

01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:23.431
What are you talking about?

01:07:23.431 --> 01:07:26.511
The code scribbled on Daniel's papers.

01:07:26.511 --> 01:07:28.671
Go back to the beginning,
Max. What's this about?

01:07:28.671 --> 01:07:30.873
The pairs of numbers,
it's a specific schoolboy code.

01:07:30.873 --> 01:07:33.993
The first number is a line
on the first page of a book,

01:07:33.993 --> 01:07:35.914
the second number is the
letter. Counting across.

01:07:35.914 --> 01:07:38.315
If you know the specific book,
you can decipher it.

01:07:38.315 --> 01:07:40.235
But it was never a book at all!

01:07:40.235 --> 01:07:41.916
Every boy knows a verse by heart.

01:07:41.916 --> 01:07:44.195
A prayer. The school prayer.

01:07:44.195 --> 01:07:49.196
That's what these numbers
refer to, Oskar. Look!

01:07:55.359 --> 01:07:58.840
P...

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:00.079
R...

01:08:00.079 --> 01:08:01.361
O...

01:08:01.361 --> 01:08:04.080
V...

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.121
E...

01:08:05.121 --> 01:08:06.161
..H...

01:08:06.161 --> 01:08:07.402
Y...

01:08:07.402 --> 01:08:09.403
OK, that's "worthy".

01:08:09.403 --> 01:08:11.323
"Prove yourself worthy."

01:08:11.323 --> 01:08:12.404
C... H...

01:08:12.404 --> 01:08:13.444
O... O...

01:08:13.444 --> 01:08:14.724
S...

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:17.363
E.

01:08:17.363 --> 01:08:20.085
Z...

01:08:20.085 --> 01:08:25.086
E...

01:08:27.488 --> 01:08:29.127
L...

01:08:29.127 --> 01:08:30.167
E...

01:08:30.167 --> 01:08:31.287
N...

01:08:31.287 --> 01:08:32.328
K...

01:08:32.328 --> 01:08:37.129
A.

01:08:37.129 --> 01:08:40.450
They received coded messages.

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:43.331
It was never a random choice.

01:08:43.331 --> 01:08:46.091
It's not over.

01:08:46.091 --> 01:08:48.813
There'll be others.

01:08:48.813 --> 01:08:50.894
We have to catch them in the act.

01:08:50.894 --> 01:08:55.814
Ah.

01:09:42.787 --> 01:09:44.667
What have I ever done to...? Shut up!

01:09:44.667 --> 01:09:49.669
Don't talk.

01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:57.150
What's that for?

01:10:03.713 --> 01:10:08.714
Tonight, we're going to
teach you some courage.

01:10:13.795 --> 01:10:18.797
Go on.

01:10:26.919 --> 01:10:31.279
Put it in your mouth.

01:10:31.279 --> 01:10:32.720
No.

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.521
Please.

01:10:34.521 --> 01:10:39.522
Don't.

01:10:52.605 --> 01:10:54.285
Do you want to belong?

01:10:54.285 --> 01:10:56.687
Do you want to be one of us?

01:10:56.687 --> 01:10:59.086
Do it!

01:10:59.086 --> 01:11:02.648
Now, go on, Stoikjavic!

01:11:10.409 --> 01:11:12.691
Someone's coming! Someone's here!

01:11:37.657 --> 01:11:41.097
Haussman! That one!

01:11:41.097 --> 01:11:42.217
Ah.

01:11:42.217 --> 01:11:47.219
The Ambassador will be proud.

01:11:54.702 --> 01:11:59.703
Get up, boys! Up!

01:12:01.342 --> 01:12:03.423
What did you think would happen?

01:12:03.423 --> 01:12:08.424
That you'd be an officer one day?

01:12:10.225 --> 01:12:12.385
All you had to do was
drag someone weaker

01:12:12.385 --> 01:12:17.387
down to the crypt and torture them?

01:12:17.868 --> 01:12:20.949
It's our tradition.

01:12:20.949 --> 01:12:24.308
Rite of passage.

01:12:24.308 --> 01:12:29.310
It's what we've always done.

01:12:34.151 --> 01:12:37.873
You can't stop it.

01:12:39.673 --> 01:12:42.634
Max! For God's sake!

01:12:42.634 --> 01:12:46.635
He's just a boy!

01:12:57.517 --> 01:12:59.398
You can't stop it.

01:12:59.398 --> 01:13:04.399
It's how it's always been!

01:13:30.767 --> 01:13:32.727
Don't.

01:13:32.727 --> 01:13:36.247
Put it down. Don't be stupid.

01:13:36.247 --> 01:13:39.528
You think you're better?

01:13:39.528 --> 01:13:43.850
You think you have the
right to hurt us all?

01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:45.330
Perger, please.

01:13:45.330 --> 01:13:49.652
Please...

01:13:49.652 --> 01:13:52.171
Look at him.

01:13:52.171 --> 01:13:57.213
He's just a boy.

01:13:57.253 --> 01:14:02.254
He's just a frightened child.

01:14:09.536 --> 01:14:14.497
It's all right. It's all right.

01:14:37.944 --> 01:14:40.544
There's been a complaint.

01:14:40.544 --> 01:14:42.545
General Wolf.

01:14:42.545 --> 01:14:44.986
Excessive use of force against his son.

01:14:44.986 --> 01:14:48.546
Commissioner... Dammit!

01:14:48.546 --> 01:14:51.107
I warned you.

01:14:51.107 --> 01:14:53.187
This is delicate.

01:14:53.187 --> 01:14:57.589
Who is responsible?

01:14:57.589 --> 01:15:00.109
I am.

01:15:00.109 --> 01:15:05.110
Anything that happened,
I take full responsibility for it.

01:15:05.912 --> 01:15:09.633
This doesn't look good.

01:15:09.633 --> 01:15:14.634
All eyes are on you for a
possible promotion, Rheinhardt.

01:15:24.917 --> 01:15:26.356
I know what's hurting you, Daniel.

01:15:26.356 --> 01:15:30.038
I know what you did to one another.

01:15:30.038 --> 01:15:35.039
Can you tell me what happened
the night Thomas Zelenka died?

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:41.041
It was my turn.

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:47.321
And Thomas was selected for punishment?

01:15:47.321 --> 01:15:51.243
Yes.

01:16:02.565 --> 01:16:04.446
But he ran?

01:16:04.446 --> 01:16:09.048
Yes.

01:16:09.048 --> 01:16:12.689
Zelenka! Boys!

01:16:12.689 --> 01:16:14.890
He refused to submit.

01:16:14.890 --> 01:16:18.330
So, he tried to get away...

01:16:18.330 --> 01:16:20.931
..and he disappeared into the forest.

01:16:22.171 --> 01:16:24.251
We were frightened he would tell.

01:16:24.251 --> 01:16:26.733
You can't escape!

01:16:26.733 --> 01:16:31.734
We chased him down to the river.

01:16:32.774 --> 01:16:36.454
Who dealt the blow, Daniel?

01:16:36.454 --> 01:16:38.495
I don't understand.

01:16:38.495 --> 01:16:41.017
Who hit him?

01:16:41.017 --> 01:16:43.256
No-one.

01:16:43.256 --> 01:16:44.938
No.

01:16:44.938 --> 01:16:46.618
Please...

01:16:46.618 --> 01:16:51.298
..let me go.

01:16:51.298 --> 01:16:55.179
He was sick. He was choking...

01:16:55.179 --> 01:17:00.181
Unable to breathe.

01:17:06.783 --> 01:17:11.785
He died right in front of us.
None of us even touched him.

01:17:14.985 --> 01:17:16.145
We thought...

01:17:16.145 --> 01:17:20.226
We assumed that maybe he'd
had some sort of attack...

01:17:20.226 --> 01:17:25.227
Because of what you'd done to him? Yes.

01:17:25.427 --> 01:17:30.428
So, you threw his
body in the river? Yes.

01:17:36.671 --> 01:17:41.632
I buried his clothes,
so no-one would know.

01:17:41.632 --> 01:17:43.272
What clothes?

01:17:43.272 --> 01:17:48.273
His cape.

01:17:48.273 --> 01:17:50.715
I...

01:17:50.715 --> 01:17:55.475
I was the one who was trying to hide it.

01:17:55.475 --> 01:17:58.117
Poor Thomas... I watched
him die right in front of me.

01:18:03.397 --> 01:18:04.878
I know.

01:18:04.878 --> 01:18:09.399
I'm sorry... I know, darling.

01:18:14.681 --> 01:18:18.642
Zelenka was already dying.

01:18:18.642 --> 01:18:21.442
I think I can prove it, Leah.

01:18:21.442 --> 01:18:26.443
But I need Daniel to come back to
the school with me one more time.

01:18:28.645 --> 01:18:31.444
Please?

01:18:45.729 --> 01:18:49.169
It's some sort of cyanide gas.
There's no marks on it,

01:18:49.169 --> 01:18:52.250
but you can smell it... just.

01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:54.610
No, there's nothing to see.

01:18:54.610 --> 01:18:56.411
It's colourless and odourless to some,

01:18:56.411 --> 01:18:59.853
but, to some, it has a
distinct residue of the scent.

01:18:59.853 --> 01:19:02.053
So, he was poisoned?

01:19:02.053 --> 01:19:03.814
Yes.

01:19:03.814 --> 01:19:05.974
His lungs?

01:19:05.974 --> 01:19:07.895
Well, once the lungs
were clogged with water,

01:19:07.895 --> 01:19:11.335
it would have been impossible to trace.

01:19:11.335 --> 01:19:14.897
Well, how would you
achieve something like that?

01:19:14.897 --> 01:19:18.778
Well, you would need
access to a laboratory or...

01:19:18.778 --> 01:19:23.779
Specialist knowledge of chemistry. Hm.

01:19:24.178 --> 01:19:26.179
I was in the Army Medical Corps...

01:19:26.179 --> 01:19:31.180
I teach the boys
chemistry and biology...

01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:35.662
Where's your father, Fraulein?

01:19:39.863 --> 01:19:44.544
You were having an affair?

01:19:44.544 --> 01:19:48.706
That boy?

01:19:48.706 --> 01:19:49.946
No.

01:19:49.946 --> 01:19:51.385
No, never.

01:19:51.385 --> 01:19:55.346
He was... very kind.

01:19:55.346 --> 01:19:57.347
Oh, God.

01:19:57.347 --> 01:20:00.989
Poor Thomas.

01:20:00.989 --> 01:20:03.750
We know about the letter.

01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:08.751
One of the boys discovered it.

01:20:12.152 --> 01:20:15.472
Those letters weren't from him.

01:20:15.472 --> 01:20:17.153
What?

01:20:17.153 --> 01:20:19.074
I should have told you.

01:20:19.074 --> 01:20:24.075
Zelenka was just a messenger.

01:20:28.796 --> 01:20:33.316
Gentlemen?

01:20:33.316 --> 01:20:34.998
Herr Becker?

01:20:34.998 --> 01:20:37.477
Forgive the intrusion.

01:20:37.477 --> 01:20:39.398
I'm sorry, I thought
you were finished here.

01:20:39.398 --> 01:20:43.760
I have a class, but if you'll wait...?

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:46.881
We came to talk about your daughter.

01:20:50.561 --> 01:20:52.281
Out!

01:20:52.281 --> 01:20:57.283
Get out!

01:21:01.765 --> 01:21:04.165
You left her alone in that
tiny cottage every day,

01:21:04.165 --> 01:21:09.007
bored, discontent...

01:21:09.007 --> 01:21:11.246
I'm sorry, what is this about?

01:21:11.246 --> 01:21:16.247
Zelenka went there often to paint her.

01:21:16.448 --> 01:21:21.449
An adolescent boy and your
little girl, all alone.

01:21:25.570 --> 01:21:28.092
Because of what he did
to her, under your roof,

01:21:28.092 --> 01:21:31.612
right under your nose...

01:21:31.612 --> 01:21:34.973
..you decided to punish him.

01:21:34.973 --> 01:21:38.613
He sat in this room.

01:21:38.613 --> 01:21:42.135
You must have offered him a quiet
place to work in the afternoon.

01:21:45.016 --> 01:21:47.296
You set an experiment...

01:21:47.296 --> 01:21:52.297
..pumping out toxic chemicals.

01:21:55.859 --> 01:21:59.060
She is everything to me, Inspector.

01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:01.219
All I have in this world.

01:22:01.219 --> 01:22:02.420
All the boys were laughing,

01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:07.421
calling her names, taunting us.

01:22:08.461 --> 01:22:10.582
He defiled her.

01:22:10.582 --> 01:22:13.502
Zelenka made a joke of my family.

01:22:13.502 --> 01:22:16.503
Except the messages were from Lang...

01:22:16.503 --> 01:22:19.705
..not the boy.

01:22:19.705 --> 01:22:24.706
Lang arranged for Thomas to paint her.

01:22:27.107 --> 01:22:30.868
He used him as a messenger.

01:22:30.868 --> 01:22:34.829
Lang was her lover.

01:22:34.829 --> 01:22:37.790
Zelenka was just a go-between.

01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:39.469
You forced him to inhale that poison

01:22:39.469 --> 01:22:44.471
when the poor boy was just an innocent.

01:22:55.473 --> 01:22:56.514
Becker!

01:22:56.514 --> 01:22:57.715
Stop! Stop!

01:22:57.715 --> 01:23:00.116
Becker! Stop!

01:23:00.116 --> 01:23:03.596
Becker, give up!

01:23:03.596 --> 01:23:07.798
Becker!

01:23:07.798 --> 01:23:12.799
Becker! It's over!

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:19.841
Becker!

01:23:19.841 --> 01:23:24.241
Becker! Stop!

01:23:26.803 --> 01:23:27.963
Stop!

01:23:27.963 --> 01:23:29.562
Please, don't!

01:23:41.525 --> 01:23:44.127
Think of your daughter.

01:23:44.127 --> 01:23:46.687
Please.

01:23:46.687 --> 01:23:51.408
She will remember me as I was.

01:23:51.408 --> 01:23:54.689
A man of honour.

01:23:54.689 --> 01:23:59.690
No!

01:24:03.531 --> 01:24:05.532
Stop!

01:24:05.532 --> 01:24:10.533
No!

01:24:24.257 --> 01:24:25.938
The school may not survive the scandal.

01:24:25.938 --> 01:24:30.939
That's hardly our concern.

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:37.101
Very well. Well,
why don't you come and join us?

01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:39.862
We are celebrating. Sir?
Von Bulow's promotion.

01:24:39.862 --> 01:24:44.863
He's been named my successor.

01:24:53.785 --> 01:24:57.545
I was a pupil at St Florian's, too.

01:24:57.545 --> 01:25:02.547
You didn't know that, did you?

01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:14.350
Congratulations.

01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:15.710
Thank you, sir.

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:18.711
Honoured to be given the chance
to replace the irreplaceable!

01:25:20.152 --> 01:25:25.154
I will miss his sense of humour.

01:25:25.633 --> 01:25:28.313
Doctor Liebermann!

01:25:28.313 --> 01:25:33.196
A word!

01:25:40.477 --> 01:25:43.557
Sir?

01:25:43.557 --> 01:25:46.199
The morgue.

01:25:46.199 --> 01:25:50.200
You arranged for samples
to be taken from a corpse?

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:53.041
Who was the woman? A scientist.

01:25:53.041 --> 01:25:57.922
A research assistant.
Not an employee of this hospital?

01:25:57.922 --> 01:26:00.402
No, sir.

01:26:00.402 --> 01:26:05.403
I'm afraid this is very unorthodox.

01:26:05.443 --> 01:26:08.644
You will be placed on suspension
until this matter is investigated.

01:26:08.644 --> 01:26:13.645
But... Go home! You're no
longer permitted on the premises!

01:26:37.732 --> 01:26:42.733
Else?

01:27:22.184 --> 01:27:24.225
She's right, of course.

01:27:24.225 --> 01:27:29.226
Impossible for us to be together.

01:27:29.986 --> 01:27:33.227
We have so little time, Max.

01:27:33.227 --> 01:27:34.988
If you have any chance at happiness,

01:27:34.988 --> 01:27:39.308
you should grab it with both hands.

01:27:39.308 --> 01:27:42.709
Don't let the world hold you back.

01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:44.950
If you love her,

01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:48.031
whoever she is...

01:27:48.031 --> 01:27:52.351
..you should be with her.

01:27:52.351 --> 01:27:57.352
And so you're the one
giving me advice now?

01:28:00.473 --> 01:28:04.275
Your nephew, when you introduced us,

01:28:04.275 --> 01:28:08.796
you told him I was your friend.

01:28:08.796 --> 01:28:13.798
Was that true?

01:28:13.998 --> 01:28:18.999
You really don't know by now?

01:28:20.598 --> 01:28:22.800
So...

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:27.640
..tell me, Inspector,
what's our next case?
