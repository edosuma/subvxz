WEBVTT

00:08.524 --> 00:09.774
<i>Now that we're off</i>
<i>the shit list, we back</i>

00:09.858 --> 00:10.823
to big balling, baby.

00:10.943 --> 00:12.345
<i>Previously on</i> House of Lies...

00:12.473 --> 00:15.524
Some sons finding out that their
father had untreatable cancer

00:15.560 --> 00:17.000
<i>might be inclined</i>
<i>to drop everything.</i>

00:17.028 --> 00:19.445
After I told you
that I am carrying your baby,

00:19.480 --> 00:22.531
I kind of can't believe
that you have no reaction.

00:22.567 --> 00:24.317
This is my reaction.

00:24.319 --> 00:26.369
Mark, simply stated,
Ellis Hightower is a predator.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.661
Predator.
She is scary.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.080
Right?
JEANNIE: And we have just given her

00:31.115 --> 00:32.615
controlling interest
in our company.

00:32.667 --> 00:34.166
Holy shit. Blowtorch.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.752
ELLIS: Fuck this!
MARTY: Ell-Jeezy!

00:36.787 --> 00:39.455
The same mega-cunt trashing
my company all over cable news

00:39.457 --> 00:43.125
just happens to dump a load of
cash into Kaan and Associates?

00:43.127 --> 00:44.426
It's nice when dreams
work out, huh?

00:44.462 --> 00:46.261
Yeah.
You wanted me to own you...

00:46.297 --> 00:48.097
and now I do.

00:55.873 --> 00:59.024
♪ Think I'm all right ♪

00:59.060 --> 01:02.878
♪ I think it's not
a good day to die today ♪

01:02.913 --> 01:05.731
♪ You know I feel like flyin' ♪

01:05.783 --> 01:08.984
♪ I'm holding up my hand,
let me see your face, yeah... ♪

01:12.657 --> 01:14.573
All right, nice run.

01:14.625 --> 01:16.158
All right, Dad, look.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.377
This next trick,
it's called a disaster.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.828
"A disaster"?

01:19.880 --> 01:21.664
That's really a messed-up name

01:21.666 --> 01:23.999
for something that you
could actually die doing.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.718
Thus the name.

01:25.753 --> 01:26.719
(short laugh)

01:26.754 --> 01:27.886
All right, let's see it.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.342
(sighs)

01:33.344 --> 01:34.843
Disaster...

01:34.895 --> 01:36.845
averted!
(chuckling)

01:36.847 --> 01:39.314
Uh, yeah!
Economic health restored.

01:39.350 --> 01:41.767
At least for the moment.

01:41.819 --> 01:43.769
But thanks to a shitload
of hard work--

01:43.821 --> 01:46.605
and an endowment
from my billionaire fuck buddy--

01:46.657 --> 01:48.607
K and A is not only
back on its feet,

01:48.659 --> 01:52.361
but poised to go wilding through
the consulting landscape

01:52.363 --> 01:53.829
on an acquisition bender,

01:53.864 --> 01:55.864
scooping up all the little
companies in its path--

01:55.916 --> 01:57.866
one from here,
one from there--

01:57.918 --> 02:01.620
leaving a swath of broken hearts
and dreams in its wake

02:01.672 --> 02:03.622
as we disembowel our foes

02:03.674 --> 02:06.175
and fill our coffers.

02:06.210 --> 02:08.176
Aw, man, I got to say

02:08.211 --> 02:10.211
today is a good day.

02:14.101 --> 02:16.435
Whoa-ho-ho-ho.
(clapping)

02:16.470 --> 02:17.970
(whistles)

02:18.022 --> 02:20.055
Sweet disaster.
Now, come on.

02:20.107 --> 02:21.890
I got to get you
to school before...

02:21.892 --> 02:23.726
Come on, Dad.
T-Ten more minutes.

02:23.728 --> 02:25.611
Five, Ro. I need you to
get to school on time.

02:25.646 --> 02:26.895
Unless you want
to just quit school

02:26.947 --> 02:28.781
and train for the X Games.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.450
Jeannie!

02:32.620 --> 02:34.570
Hey.
Hi.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.572
(Roscoe laughs)

02:36.624 --> 02:38.741
Can you please talk some sense
into my dad tonight at dinner

02:38.743 --> 02:40.576
about, I mean, not tearing this thing down.
I will try.

02:40.578 --> 02:41.577
Hold on. Wait, wait.

02:41.579 --> 02:42.745
At-at dinner?

02:42.747 --> 02:44.580
Grandpa didn't tell you?
I thought you...

02:44.582 --> 02:47.466
Um, Jeremiah called me
yesterday.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.635
Oh. You and Pops are pals now?

02:49.670 --> 02:52.137
I... Well, he invited me
to dinner.

02:52.173 --> 02:54.139
What's the occasion?
You know...

02:54.175 --> 02:55.257
just family dinner.

02:55.259 --> 02:56.558
I think Uncle Malcolm's
coming, too.

02:56.594 --> 02:59.428
Great! Broke-ass Tavis Smiley.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.930
Family dinner.

03:03.484 --> 03:06.568
It should be fun.
(laughs)

03:06.604 --> 03:08.270
You know what else
sounds like fun?

03:08.322 --> 03:10.773
School.

03:10.825 --> 03:12.524
You got to go.

03:12.576 --> 03:14.777
So, do you know
if it's a boy or girl?

03:14.779 --> 03:16.495
It's, um...

03:16.530 --> 03:18.113
it's a girl.

03:19.917 --> 03:22.000
It's a girl.
Cool.

03:22.036 --> 03:23.619
When is she gonna
get to come over?

03:23.671 --> 03:25.087
Hey! Ring, ring, ring, ring!
Well...

03:25.122 --> 03:27.623
I hear school bells.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.091
Bye.
Bye.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.125
I'll see you tonight.

03:30.177 --> 03:31.176
Yeah, we'll pick it up later

03:31.212 --> 03:33.011
at our cozy little
family dinner.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.437
Are...

03:42.473 --> 03:44.773
you fucking serious?

03:44.809 --> 03:45.974
This is... Marty!

03:45.976 --> 03:47.309
(snaps fingers)
Marty, Marty, Marty, Marty!

03:47.361 --> 03:48.644
Jeannie, Jeannie, come.
Come, come, come, come.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.312
Jeannie, please,
come see this, please.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.781
(quietly):
But also be very quiet.

03:54.451 --> 03:55.734
(gasps)

03:55.786 --> 03:57.152
Oh, no. No, no, no.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.822
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Oh, wait.

03:59.874 --> 04:03.158
What...?

04:03.160 --> 04:05.210
Don't!
I shouldn't.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.246
I'm going to!
Don't... don't do that.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.801
(laughter)
Shh.

04:12.837 --> 04:15.003
Gentle, gentle, gentle.
Be very gentle.

04:15.005 --> 04:17.005
Let him sleep.
Be gentle.

04:22.146 --> 04:23.679
Hello, Kitty.

04:26.851 --> 04:28.350
Oh, my God.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.402
Shit! What time is it?

04:30.437 --> 04:31.937
Oh, no. God. Shit.

04:31.989 --> 04:33.488
Oh, my God, you know,
No, no, no. Oh, no.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.574
I would've overslept, too,
if I had some comfy,

04:35.609 --> 04:38.193
snuggly manjamas like those!

04:38.245 --> 04:40.863
Why, oh, why are you
wearing that, Douglas?

04:40.865 --> 04:43.582
Is this, like, a plushy thing
where you and other

04:43.617 --> 04:45.667
Cookie Monster fans
throw your keys in a bowl?

04:45.703 --> 04:47.169
Yeah, you going for that?

04:47.204 --> 04:49.037
It's not entirely sexual.
Come on, grow up.

04:49.089 --> 04:52.007
Look, I-I knew I'd be working
late on the Zobel presentation,

04:52.042 --> 04:53.792
so I thought I'd slip into
something more comfortable.

04:53.844 --> 04:55.210
What's wrong with that?

04:55.212 --> 04:56.879
So many fucking things.

04:56.881 --> 04:58.680
But your dedication
is duly noted.

04:58.716 --> 05:01.049
Yes! Thank you, Marty.
I appreciate that.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.218
Well, I thought that someone
had to roll out the red carpet

05:03.270 --> 05:05.020
for, uh, Ron Zobel and his team.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.855
Why don't we go pick up
some S'muffins, too?

05:06.891 --> 05:08.724
DOUG: Not a bad idea. I mean,
I'm excited to meet him.

05:08.726 --> 05:10.809
You know, the genius
turnaround artist

05:10.861 --> 05:12.227
hand-picked by Denna.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.896
Couple pastries
might not go astray.

05:13.898 --> 05:17.232
Kiddies, he's been brought in
here to aid in our getting huge.

05:17.284 --> 05:18.784
Don't worry about it.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.069
You may want
to change though, Pussy.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.454
Well, yeah, obviously, I mean...

05:22.489 --> 05:23.789
You're such a sweet,
sweet pussy, Doug.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.157
You're a sweet baby.
(laughs)

05:25.209 --> 05:27.075
Why am I a pussy?
(Marty meows)

05:27.077 --> 05:28.327
I don't know. Who knows?

05:28.379 --> 05:29.795
Have you seen these keys?

05:29.830 --> 05:30.829
Yeah.
Yeah.

05:30.881 --> 05:33.415
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

05:33.467 --> 05:35.467
(elevator bell dings)

05:38.555 --> 05:39.888
Ho.

05:39.924 --> 05:41.089
(laughs)

05:41.091 --> 05:43.392
(laughs)
Ron Zobel.

05:43.427 --> 05:44.977
Ron Zobel. What a pleasure.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.646
Wow, you must be
the great Martin Kaan, huh?

05:47.681 --> 05:49.097
Ah. You can call me Marty.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.230
Eh, Martin sounds stronger.

05:50.234 --> 05:51.233
Let's do that.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.435
Denna speaks the world
of you by the way.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.604
Nice work to be hitting
that boss lady, huh? Ooh.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.272
(chuckles)
Okay.

05:57.308 --> 05:58.407
Okay.
Yeah.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.609
And, uh, who...?
No, no. They're with me.

06:00.611 --> 06:01.743
Best not to mix
with them, you know?

06:01.779 --> 06:02.778
Keeps them data pure.

06:02.780 --> 06:04.746
Date pure, data strong.

06:04.782 --> 06:06.415
Know what I mean, Martin?
Okay.

06:06.450 --> 06:09.167
So, what is going on here?

06:09.203 --> 06:11.036
All right, what we's got
going on here then?

06:11.088 --> 06:12.838
Yeah, I'm feeling...

06:12.873 --> 06:15.040
I don't know.
I'm feeling...

06:15.092 --> 06:17.209
I got a feeling of deadness.

06:17.261 --> 06:18.710
Yeah, lack of commerce.

06:18.762 --> 06:21.346
I got the sixth sense--
I see dead business.

06:21.382 --> 06:24.099
Well, uh, we are going through
a rebuilding process...

06:24.134 --> 06:25.434
Okay, Martin, I'm just gonna
stop you right there.

06:25.469 --> 06:26.935
Okay?

06:26.971 --> 06:28.437
So, you're saying, you know,

06:28.472 --> 06:31.189
(gibberish) bullshit,
bullshit, rebuilding.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.524
Okay? But what I hear,

06:32.559 --> 06:35.394
what Ron Zobel is hearing,

06:35.446 --> 06:38.363
is "I'm defending my old ways,

06:38.399 --> 06:39.948
which have only taken
me so far." Am I right?

06:39.984 --> 06:42.034
Well, of course, I'm right...
You're always fucking right.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.318
I'm always fucking right!
Thank you. Oh!

06:43.320 --> 06:44.369
Specfuckintacular.

06:44.405 --> 06:45.370
You and me, we're gonna...

06:45.406 --> 06:47.873
we're gonna...
Huh?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.207
Yeah.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.209
What?

06:51.245 --> 06:52.377
Huh?

06:52.413 --> 06:54.579
Do you he...?

06:54.631 --> 06:55.998
I'm hearing a, you know,

06:56.000 --> 06:57.132
like a...

06:57.167 --> 06:59.334
I hear a sound.
I'm hearing a...

06:59.386 --> 07:01.386
Is it, I don't know,
an AC unit or...?

07:01.422 --> 07:02.587
No, no, no, no.
So-something else.

07:02.639 --> 07:04.222
It's like a...

07:04.258 --> 07:05.307
I mean, it's like a... shh-boof!

07:05.342 --> 07:06.508
Shh-boof, shh-boof sound.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.226
It's like a...

07:08.262 --> 07:09.845
Holy shit!

07:09.847 --> 07:11.179
(quietly):
Fuckin'.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.348
It's coming all the way
from Fort Worth, Texas, man.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.017
It's the sound of one of those

07:15.052 --> 07:16.401
big ol' high-speed
rotary presses

07:16.437 --> 07:17.936
from the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing,

07:17.988 --> 07:19.488
and it is printing money.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.023
Okay?
Okay.

07:21.025 --> 07:22.357
Crisp hundred dollar bills

07:22.359 --> 07:23.492
for us.
I see what you're doing.

07:23.527 --> 07:24.576
Oh, I hear it.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.495
Do you hear it?
(laughs)

07:26.530 --> 07:28.363
I don't mean hear it,
do you hear it?

07:28.415 --> 07:29.414
Say it-- "I hear it."

07:29.450 --> 07:30.699
Well, I don't actually hear it.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.117
Oh, no, but do you hear it?

07:32.169 --> 07:33.668
Do you hear it?

07:33.704 --> 07:34.953
Say it-- "I hear it."

07:35.005 --> 07:37.005
Say it--
"I hear it."

07:37.041 --> 07:38.540
"I hear it." Say it.

07:38.592 --> 07:39.591
Say it-- "I hear it."

07:39.626 --> 07:40.675
I'm good, Ron.

07:40.711 --> 07:41.676
Say it-- "I hear it."

07:41.712 --> 07:44.096
"I hear it." Say it.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.215
I hear it.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.217
(laughs, grunting)

07:51.722 --> 07:53.688
Yeah.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.026
MARTY:
<i>So, as you can see</i>

07:58.062 --> 08:00.729
with our outreach strategy, uh,
K and A's profit margins are

08:00.781 --> 08:02.364
just gonna blast
through the fucking...

08:02.399 --> 08:03.448
Ron? Ron?

08:03.484 --> 08:04.866
Hey.
(snaps his fingers)

08:04.902 --> 08:06.785
It's all happening
up here, buddy.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Pr... profit margins.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.404
I'm listening. Go on.

08:09.456 --> 08:10.906
JEANNIE: Uh, well,
our data lake

08:10.908 --> 08:13.408
illuminates how K and A
is poised for an aggressive

08:13.410 --> 08:15.377
second wave.
CLYDE: By acquiring companies

08:15.412 --> 08:17.412
we targeted that specialize

08:17.414 --> 08:19.965
in emerging technologies
and manufacturing.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.833
Are you playing a fucking game

08:21.885 --> 08:23.085
on your phone?
(laughs)

08:23.137 --> 08:24.886
You know, I'm multitasking,
okay?

08:24.922 --> 08:28.590
I mean, we-we-we'll have
a corner on the marketplace.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.724
Right, yeah, so if you just

08:29.760 --> 08:31.226
take a look at the
competitive landscape

08:31.261 --> 08:33.511
metrics, you'll see that
we have a baseline in place

08:33.563 --> 08:36.481
to oversee the dev cycles
on the other boutique shops.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.265
So, uh, what?
So, that's your big plan

08:38.318 --> 08:39.934
to get huge?
Uh...

08:39.937 --> 08:41.602
Yeah, that's the big plan, Ron.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.020
We are going to build
a mothership

08:43.073 --> 08:46.324
and rule the fucking universe.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.827
Well, if you had
the ability to do that,

08:48.862 --> 08:50.612
then I wouldn't be here.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.998
(Marty and Clyde chuckling)

08:53.033 --> 08:54.616
$22 million investment-- boom!

08:54.618 --> 08:56.751
That's called infrastructure,
then we...

08:56.787 --> 08:58.587
But if you have any suggestions

08:58.622 --> 08:59.955
as to how to enhance our buyout
strategy, we'd love to...

08:59.957 --> 09:01.590
Well, let me stop...

09:01.625 --> 09:02.924
You know what?
Let me stop you right there.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.544
Um, because I really think
it's a bit premature

09:05.596 --> 09:07.345
to begin implementing strategy.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.514
Really? (chuckles)

09:09.550 --> 09:11.800
Because that's the expressed
purpose of this meeting.

09:11.802 --> 09:12.934
Strategy meeting.
Strategy.

09:12.970 --> 09:14.469
Yeah, strategy meeting, I think.

09:14.471 --> 09:17.439
Yeah, that's why I stayed up
all night doing the strategy.

09:17.474 --> 09:18.807
Well, you know what?

09:18.859 --> 09:20.392
Um...

09:20.444 --> 09:22.394
This is really great.

09:22.446 --> 09:23.945
A lot of great stuff.

09:23.981 --> 09:25.113
Uh, awesome.

09:25.149 --> 09:26.948
And we'll take it
under advisement.

09:26.984 --> 09:29.317
Oh, great, you're gonna
take it under advisement.

09:29.319 --> 09:32.320
We're gonna first
need to excavate

09:32.372 --> 09:34.539
the quantitative architecture
of your firm to gain

09:34.575 --> 09:37.993
a better understanding
of what growth strategy is best.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.744
You got to look under the hood.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.329
Right, Janine?

09:41.331 --> 09:44.382
(phone ringing) Okay, so let's just clear
this whole space out.

09:44.418 --> 09:45.967
Oh, my gosh.

09:46.003 --> 09:49.721
And, uh, my team
will set up a war room.

09:49.756 --> 09:53.341
Hey, talk to me, sexy.

09:55.000 --> 10:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:03.270 --> 10:05.987
How's that first day
working out for you?

10:06.023 --> 10:07.022
Oh, it's great, Janine.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.940
(chuckles)
How's yours?

10:08.992 --> 10:12.027
Just wondering what they're
deciding about our future.

10:12.029 --> 10:13.745
Well, they're not deciding shit
without us,

10:13.780 --> 10:15.080
so I wouldn't worry about it.

10:15.115 --> 10:19.251
Their commanding officer
owns 60% of K and A, Marty.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.503
Denna can technically do
whatever the fuck she wants.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.672
I was just under
the assumption that you two

10:23.707 --> 10:25.540
had an understanding about
the roll that she would play.

10:25.592 --> 10:26.841
Yeah, we do.

10:26.877 --> 10:28.793
Okay, so nip it
in the bud, Marty.

10:28.845 --> 10:31.012
Call your girlfriend,
set her straight.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.681
Jeannie, Denna
grubstaked K and A

10:32.716 --> 10:34.216
as an investment, not a favor.

10:34.268 --> 10:35.884
I don't need to check in
with Mommy

10:35.936 --> 10:37.185
on how to run my company.

10:37.221 --> 10:38.720
Our company.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.773
Hey,

10:41.808 --> 10:43.558
about dinner tonight,
don't worry about it.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.443
What does that mean?
I'm gonna call Jeremiah

10:45.479 --> 10:46.840
and tell him I can't come.
Jeannie.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.446
I have so much other shit to do,
anyway, Marty.

10:48.482 --> 10:51.032
You-you cannot. Hey,
look, you can't, okay?

10:52.286 --> 10:54.786
They'd fucking blame me.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.872
Okay.

10:57.908 --> 10:59.908
(phone ringing,
indistinct conversations)

11:02.045 --> 11:04.079
How much fucking longer
do you think they're gonna take

11:04.131 --> 11:05.547
snooping around all our shit?

11:05.582 --> 11:07.249
Is this what it's like
when we come in?

11:07.301 --> 11:09.217
God, I like it much better
being on the other side.

11:09.253 --> 11:10.468
MARTY:
Hey, kiddies.

11:10.504 --> 11:11.836
Get your trunks.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.255
It's time to deliver
these deliverables to SkyEast.

11:13.307 --> 11:14.639
Yep.
Hey, Martin.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.341
Yeah.
Martin?

11:16.393 --> 11:18.843
So we got a few
initial findings, okay?

11:18.895 --> 11:20.145
So let's talk through them.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.680
Yeah, now's not
a great time, Ron.

11:21.732 --> 11:23.515
We've got this local engagement
we've got to go to.

11:23.567 --> 11:24.816
Oh, great.
I'd love to join you.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.985
(snaps) Yes, yes, see some
of that Martin Kaan magic

11:27.020 --> 11:28.270
I've heard so much about.

11:28.322 --> 11:30.355
It's really a do-nothing
implementation meeting.

11:30.407 --> 11:31.573
We'll talk on the way.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.942
(elevator bell dings)

11:37.698 --> 11:40.699
Look, I can't go to my bosses
with this suboptimal shit.

11:40.751 --> 11:42.334
MARTY: We-we understand
how you feel,

11:42.369 --> 11:44.119
and I-I'm glad you brought
this to our attention.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.503
O-Okay, so now how many times

11:45.539 --> 11:47.122
do I have to call you
when it's not an emergency?

11:47.124 --> 11:48.790
DOUG: Listen, you have
our full attention right now.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.875
And we are happy
to resolve any glitches.

11:50.927 --> 11:53.128
So how can we help you?

11:53.130 --> 11:54.462
So, look, okay,

11:54.464 --> 11:56.131
the-the segment models
that you sent.

11:56.133 --> 11:59.768
I mean, look,
it-it's opaque at best.

11:59.803 --> 12:01.636
Well, I'm looking at
the same thing you're looking at

12:01.638 --> 12:02.971
and it seems pretty clear to me.

12:03.023 --> 12:06.308
Really? Could... Hey, maybe
you have glaucoma, Marty.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.026
This right here,
that's cloudy as fuck.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.644
Okay, Derek, if you
don't understand

12:09.696 --> 12:11.646
how segment models work,
we would be happy...

12:11.698 --> 12:13.982
Are-are you calling me an idiot?
No, no, no.

12:15.319 --> 12:16.651
I talk to my bosses, not you.

12:16.703 --> 12:17.986
And they're looking for updates.

12:17.988 --> 12:20.989
So you need to start
explaining this shit

12:21.041 --> 12:23.124
in a language that people on
this planet speak

12:23.160 --> 12:24.626
or we-we-we have to

12:24.661 --> 12:26.494
revisit this arrangement.

12:26.496 --> 12:29.381
Derek, everything here
is exactly as promised.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.499
(door opens)
I can walk you through it step-by-step.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.001
Mr. Rainey,
I've got Chris Crespo for you.

12:33.003 --> 12:34.002
(sighs)

12:34.004 --> 12:35.587
Okay, just e-excuse me a minute.

12:35.639 --> 12:37.589
Of course.

12:41.345 --> 12:43.478
Okay, he's losing
his fucking shit.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.347
We got to turn it up
on this asshole, all right?

12:45.349 --> 12:47.515
He needs his plush toy.
Where's Jeannie?

12:47.517 --> 12:49.484
Um, hey, Marty, can I ask you,

12:49.519 --> 12:51.186
are the mutes going
to be shadowing us

12:51.238 --> 12:52.487
on all our consults?

12:52.522 --> 12:54.022
'Cause they're
kind of freaking me out.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.523
Are you serious right now, Doug?

12:55.575 --> 12:57.158
Go find fucking Jeannie.

12:57.194 --> 12:58.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go find her.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.195
Uh, I have a question for you.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.413
Mind if we step out?

13:02.416 --> 13:03.898
Yeah.

13:03.934 --> 13:05.854
You're gonna leave me
in a room alone with these?

13:05.869 --> 13:07.836
MARTY:
Grow up, Clyde.

13:07.871 --> 13:10.372
(door closes)
This is how I die.

13:10.374 --> 13:11.673
There you are!

13:11.708 --> 13:13.675
Jeannie, we really
need you upstairs.

13:13.710 --> 13:14.709
We're losing him.

13:14.761 --> 13:16.845
I-I...
Are you okay?

13:16.880 --> 13:18.463
I don't know. I...

13:18.515 --> 13:20.215
I just feel a little weird.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.434
Oh, mother of God,
are we having this baby?

13:22.469 --> 13:24.102
Here, sit down.
No, we are not even

13:24.137 --> 13:25.887
having this conversation, Doug.

13:25.889 --> 13:29.391
I just, I'm just having
a little bit of pain.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.059
Oh.

13:31.061 --> 13:32.977
Oh. (chuckles)

13:33.029 --> 13:35.897
Okay, all right,
very interesting.

13:35.899 --> 13:38.116
Interesting how? Okay, what?

13:38.151 --> 13:39.901
Doug...
Nothing, nothing.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.653
If you have something to say,
spit it out.

13:41.705 --> 13:44.372
I don't think you have
to be Queegueg

13:44.408 --> 13:45.740
to read the bones here, Jeannie.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.159
I mean, you suddenly feel sick
What?

13:48.211 --> 13:50.795
on the night that
you're supposed to have dinner

13:50.831 --> 13:52.163
with Marty and his family.
Oh, please.

13:52.215 --> 13:53.248
It makes perfect sense.
Jesus.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.332
It has nothing to...

13:54.384 --> 13:56.418
And this is a good thing.
You should be excited

13:56.470 --> 13:57.752
he's bringing you into the family.
Oh, God.

13:57.754 --> 13:58.803
Ow! Fuck.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.805
(winces) Ooh. Ooh.
Oh, God, miscarriage.

14:00.841 --> 14:03.308
No, I'm not having a miscarriage, Doug!
We got a miscarriage!

14:03.343 --> 14:04.426
It's okay, it's not your fault.

14:04.428 --> 14:05.677
I'm not having the baby, either.

14:05.729 --> 14:07.429
Just, please, would you
go get me some water?

14:07.481 --> 14:08.596
Of course, here.

14:08.598 --> 14:09.931
Wait, do I need to boil it
or anything?

14:09.933 --> 14:11.933
Just water!
Anything, got it.

14:11.935 --> 14:14.269
(exhales)

14:14.271 --> 14:16.237
Look, I was told that
you could have a tendency

14:16.273 --> 14:18.106
to be a little less than careful
with your clients.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.942
Oh, the things people say.
(chuckles)

14:20.994 --> 14:22.327
Now, I'm no consultant...

14:22.362 --> 14:23.495
Correct.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.447
...but I'm a businessman,

14:25.499 --> 14:27.282
(sighs)
and I know better

14:27.334 --> 14:28.783
than to deflect,

14:28.785 --> 14:30.502
uh, when my client is
seeking assurances.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.504
I mean, this is the
service industry, man.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.289
Right? The clients
are always right. 100%.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.624
Well, unless-unless they're
a panicky little bitch

14:36.676 --> 14:38.877
like Derek in there,
and they're not right.

14:38.929 --> 14:40.962
Look, look, Ron,

14:41.014 --> 14:42.764
we've got the fucking job, okay?

14:42.799 --> 14:45.300
This isn't a pitch; we're
running an implementation...

14:45.302 --> 14:47.270
Okay, so maybe I only turned
around 29 Fortune 500 companies.

14:47.390 --> 14:49.971
Oh, my God, then maybe you think
you could run this consult better than I...

14:49.973 --> 14:51.973
Fuck yeah, if I gave a shit
about consulting.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.892
Okay.
So, what?

14:53.944 --> 14:55.664
You think maybe you know
every fucking thing

14:55.695 --> 14:57.228
there is to know
about consulting?

14:57.280 --> 14:59.197
Well, maybe you do, okay.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.574
But I'm here to give you
your goddamn golden ticket.

15:03.023 --> 15:04.402
Huh? The keys to your Bugatti.

15:04.454 --> 15:07.739
- Uh-huh. - I'm here to maximize profits
and eliminate waste.

15:07.791 --> 15:09.707
So maybe you should stop
rolling your eyes

15:09.743 --> 15:11.242
every time I open my mouth

15:11.294 --> 15:12.961
and listen.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.496
Because I'm
spitting wisdom, man.

15:14.498 --> 15:15.663
I am.

15:15.715 --> 15:19.050
I'm holding your
balls in my hand.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.920
So I can either cradle or crush.

15:24.474 --> 15:25.673
You get my drift, Martin?

15:25.725 --> 15:28.176
Yeah.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.566
(sighs)

15:34.601 --> 15:36.768
Hey, so how's it
gonna work, exactly?

15:36.820 --> 15:39.103
How's what gonna work?

15:39.155 --> 15:42.023
Well, with you and Marty
and the baby?

15:42.025 --> 15:43.775
You know, I mean,
I know things have been

15:43.827 --> 15:45.276
a little strained
between you two since, uh...

15:45.328 --> 15:47.362
Doug, I need you to mind your
own business on this, okay?

15:47.364 --> 15:49.080
Okay.
'Cause it's not... Shit!

15:49.115 --> 15:50.415
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Oh, my God.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.866
Oh, shit. You know what,
I'm gonna get Marty.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.251
No, don't get Marty, don't, don't, Doug.
No, I...

15:53.286 --> 15:54.369
Why not?
Because we don't need Marty.

15:54.371 --> 15:55.703
I don't need Marty!

15:55.705 --> 15:57.288
(groaning) Okay.
Ow! Oh!

15:57.340 --> 15:59.090
Hey, I got this.
(sighs loudly)

15:59.125 --> 16:01.543
- I have seen enough <i> House</i>
to know what I'm doing here. - Fuck.

16:01.595 --> 16:03.545
- What are you doing? Ow.
- It's all right; I got it. Just hold...

16:03.597 --> 16:05.213
bite down on this. It's gonna hurt.
Don't. Doug, don't. Oh, my God.

16:05.215 --> 16:06.214
I'm gonna take your pants off.
Doug, don't, stop.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.215
I have to.
Oh, my God!

16:07.217 --> 16:08.883
Doug, no!
It's the baby talking.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.603
Oh!
(farts loudly)

16:11.638 --> 16:14.222
Ugh.
(moans)

16:14.274 --> 16:15.557
(farting continues)
(sighs)

16:15.609 --> 16:17.892
Whew.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.894
(farting continues)

16:19.896 --> 16:22.730
Oh, my God.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.066
It feels so much better.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.618
Does it?

16:26.653 --> 16:29.654
Let's go finish
this fucking consult, right?

16:29.706 --> 16:32.123
(chuckles)

16:33.877 --> 16:35.877
(gags, coughs)

16:41.801 --> 16:44.168
If this is
the customer reference system,

16:44.220 --> 16:46.421
how do I identify which are
the key channel data streams

16:46.473 --> 16:48.089
you mentioned?

16:48.141 --> 16:49.641
(sighs)

16:49.676 --> 16:50.758
I'm sorry.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.260
Ron, what do you think, buddy?

16:52.312 --> 16:54.312
Uh, what? Excuse me?

16:54.347 --> 16:55.980
Why are you asking him?

16:56.016 --> 16:57.181
I'm terribly sorry.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.100
I neglected to, uh, introduce
our colleague.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.102
Uh, this is Ron Zobel.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.604
He has come on board
with K and A

17:02.606 --> 17:04.606
after turning around
several dozen

17:04.657 --> 17:06.858
Fortune 500 companies.
He really is

17:06.910 --> 17:07.942
a certified expert

17:07.944 --> 17:09.193
on growth strategy.

17:09.244 --> 17:11.112
DEREK:
O-Oh.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.829
O-Okay.
Yeah.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.531
So, so what do you think, Ron?
We have a mid-level

17:14.584 --> 17:16.501
regional airline looking
to expand.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.953
Well, I mean,
it depends on what, uh,

17:19.005 --> 17:21.839
benchmarks you guys are
using to, uh, measure growth.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.208
Oh, well, all the touch
points are here

17:24.260 --> 17:25.710
in the GANNT chart.
Uh, Clyde, could you...

17:25.762 --> 17:27.462
Absolutely. Give me one second.

17:27.513 --> 17:29.347
And...

17:29.382 --> 17:30.682
Great.
Check your computer.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.300
Thank you.
(clears throat)

17:32.352 --> 17:33.968
So, uh,

17:34.020 --> 17:35.637
just walk us through it.

17:35.639 --> 17:36.888
Is it a retooling

17:36.940 --> 17:38.723
of the go to market model
or the, uh,

17:38.775 --> 17:40.058
cost model?

17:40.110 --> 17:41.309
Well, naturally, uh,

17:41.311 --> 17:42.694
I'd have to really...

17:44.064 --> 17:45.196
...study the, um,

17:45.231 --> 17:47.532
the specs.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.317
Oh, take your time.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.035
Yeah, really breathe it in.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.072
Fuck. (chuckles)

17:54.124 --> 17:55.657
Now, your eyes

17:55.709 --> 17:57.625
are saying cost model,

17:57.661 --> 17:59.661
but your lips are saying
"I don't know dick

17:59.663 --> 18:02.497
about management consulting."

18:04.718 --> 18:05.833
No, say it.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.001
I get it.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.136
But you should say it.

18:08.171 --> 18:09.387
Make you feel better.
Say it.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.422
No, I get it, asshole.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.842
And...

18:14.844 --> 18:16.844
I will crush.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.566
MARTY: Bye, Ron.
(door opens)

18:21.601 --> 18:23.017
(door closes)
(robotically): Uh... oh, what...

18:23.019 --> 18:25.019
what do we do in this situation?

18:25.071 --> 18:26.432
We are not programmed
to improvise.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.822
CLYDE:
Our heads are made of gears!

18:27.857 --> 18:29.857
MARTY: We, uh, uh, we are fumbling.
We are...

18:29.859 --> 18:31.109
breaking down.

18:31.161 --> 18:33.077
Uh... uh, oh.
Uh, shall we...what should we...

18:33.113 --> 18:34.862
Uh, uh, oh, uh, oh.
Uh, oh.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.164
Hi. I'm so sorry.

18:36.199 --> 18:38.199
I got sick in the car
on the way over,

18:38.251 --> 18:39.417
but I'm better now.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.002
Ah, Jeannie.
Uh, you're glowing.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.704
Uh, please tell me
something good,

18:42.756 --> 18:45.873
because Marty here
has completely freaked me out.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.709
What? Derek...

18:47.761 --> 18:49.794
I have an implementation for you

18:49.846 --> 18:52.764
that is going to make you fall
even deeper in love with me.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.348
May not be possible.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.050
(laughter)

18:57.103 --> 18:58.352
Let's give it a shot.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.021
Okay. Whip it out.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.439
(clears throat)

19:01.474 --> 19:03.725
Start here.
Okay.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.727
(typing)

19:05.729 --> 19:07.729
(door opens, cat meowing)

19:10.650 --> 19:12.533
You're home early.

19:12.569 --> 19:14.285
I don't know how you
expect to make

19:14.320 --> 19:15.620
the big money doing that.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.072
Fine, Dad.
Marty let us out.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.657
Did you open my door again?

19:19.709 --> 19:21.659
Look, Natalie Portman
happens to like it

19:21.711 --> 19:23.077
in your room.
Ah, no, no.

19:23.129 --> 19:24.996
Probably the last time
you ever heard that.

19:25.048 --> 19:26.164
Get the fuck out!
(meows)

19:26.216 --> 19:28.466
Get out.
Please get the fuck out.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.550
Dad?

19:29.586 --> 19:30.752
Dad, we talked about this.

19:30.754 --> 19:32.420
Now there's gonna be
cat hair and dander

19:32.422 --> 19:33.554
all over my fucking pillows.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.173
You know how much of a nancy boy

19:35.225 --> 19:36.791
you sound like
when you say that, right?

19:36.826 --> 19:38.259
I sound like a nancy boy.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.510
And why didn't you
return my texts?

19:39.562 --> 19:41.512
During the day, I'm very
busy, okay, so if you

19:41.564 --> 19:43.648
can ease up on the texts,
that would help me a lot.

19:44.818 --> 19:46.350
Don't... (sighs)

19:46.402 --> 19:49.771
Listen, I know you're trying
to enjoy this time of yours.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.105
I'm sorry.
Just please,

19:51.157 --> 19:53.157
close the door.
How hard is that?

19:53.193 --> 19:56.160
I just need a little bit of help
with the computer. That's all.

19:56.196 --> 19:59.781
Oh, my fucking God.
Are you serious?

19:59.783 --> 20:01.703
You needed me to help you
figure out the computer

20:01.751 --> 20:03.000
so you could watch porno?

20:03.036 --> 20:05.119
(meowing)
Clyde, I'm dying.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.204
Oh, no.
Would you deny

20:06.256 --> 20:07.955
your dying father
<i>la petite mort?</i>

20:08.007 --> 20:09.540
No, you're not allowed
to speak French on top of it.

20:09.592 --> 20:11.459
Well, I've certainly walked in
on you before, right?

20:11.461 --> 20:12.543
That's when I was 15.

20:12.595 --> 20:14.128
It's the circle.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.513
Oh, my God.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.131
We return, we return.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.217
So much death in this family.

20:19.269 --> 20:20.802
That's what it is.
No, no, no.

20:20.854 --> 20:23.387
You're not allowed to justify
your jacking off with cancer

20:23.439 --> 20:25.056
and the Holocaust, Dad.

20:25.108 --> 20:26.808
Do you fucking realize
how crazy that is?

20:29.145 --> 20:30.645
Okay, I am trying my best

20:30.697 --> 20:33.197
to get past everything
that has happened in our family

20:33.233 --> 20:34.365
and to sympathize

20:34.400 --> 20:36.317
with your situation.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.451
Okay?

20:37.487 --> 20:38.986
You know that I care about you.

20:39.038 --> 20:41.372
I... I am fucking trying, man.

20:41.407 --> 20:44.992
You know something?
I don't need your sympathy.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.661
How about just
a little bit of deference

20:46.713 --> 20:48.663
for the man whose <i> shpritz</i>

20:48.715 --> 20:49.831
gave you life?

20:49.833 --> 20:51.415
Sh... It's...

20:51.467 --> 20:54.335
Okay, Dad, you got to find
a new place to stay,

20:54.337 --> 20:56.170
starting tomorrow.

20:56.172 --> 20:58.172
(Natalie Portman meowing)

21:04.347 --> 21:05.596
Hello.

21:05.648 --> 21:06.931
DENNA:
Hey, there.

21:06.983 --> 21:09.066
Guess I know why you're here.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.735
Ron's not happy.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.154
Like...

21:13.189 --> 21:14.488
really fucking mad.

21:14.524 --> 21:15.857
(both chuckle)

21:15.859 --> 21:18.075
I didn't know that, when you
were that fucking crazy,

21:18.111 --> 21:19.410
you still had emotions.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.279
I know he can be
a pain sometimes,

21:21.331 --> 21:23.531
but he's made a ton
of money for Global.

21:23.533 --> 21:25.032
And he'll do the same for you

21:25.084 --> 21:27.535
if I can talk him
into ever coming back here.

21:27.587 --> 21:29.337
Denna, you know how I run
my business, okay?

21:29.372 --> 21:31.088
I don't need somebody looking
over my fucking shoulder.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.423
Now, if this Al Haig asshole...

21:32.458 --> 21:34.041
Marty, calm down.

21:34.043 --> 21:35.543
Isn't this what we discussed?

21:35.595 --> 21:36.878
Making K and A huge?

21:36.930 --> 21:38.796
Yeah. Kaan and Associates.

21:40.266 --> 21:43.384
He's an expert
at building companies.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.936
But you're right, Marty.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.221
Ron doesn't have
any feelings to get

21:47.223 --> 21:49.056
tangled up in-- unlike you.

21:50.109 --> 21:52.393
Oh, this is gonna be fantastic.

21:52.445 --> 21:55.062
Um, what exactly do you mean?

21:55.114 --> 21:57.732
(chuckles) Asks the man
who forked over half his company

21:57.784 --> 22:00.284
to a woman who, in turn,
sent him to federal prison.

22:02.405 --> 22:04.288
We talked about that, Denna.

22:04.324 --> 22:06.290
Marty, I like you,

22:06.326 --> 22:08.075
but I don't have any
complicated feelings

22:08.077 --> 22:09.243
about what we're doing here.

22:09.295 --> 22:10.661
Business is business.

22:10.713 --> 22:13.464
Oh, my God, I've got to
needlepoint that on a pillow.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.660
Now, what... "Business is..."
What was the second part?

22:15.668 --> 22:17.752
Okay.

22:17.804 --> 22:19.503
So, which victory
means more to you?

22:19.555 --> 22:21.339
Saying "fuck you"
to my turnaround artist

22:21.391 --> 22:24.058
or making serious
fuck-you money?

22:27.313 --> 22:28.930
Marty...

22:28.982 --> 22:31.933
I want you to really picture
what it is you want most

22:31.985 --> 22:36.103
and ask yourself,
"What is that worth?"

22:37.273 --> 22:39.273
JEREMIAH:
Okay, wait, wait, wait, so...

22:39.325 --> 22:41.025
so, wait.

22:41.077 --> 22:43.110
When exactly are you due?

22:44.864 --> 22:46.831
Three weeks from tomorrow.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.450
(chuckling):
Whoa.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.085
Yeah.
Whoa.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.120
She's almost here.

22:53.172 --> 22:55.456
MALCOLM:
So I'm gonna be a...

22:55.458 --> 22:57.041
be an uncle all over again.

22:57.093 --> 22:58.292
Yeah.
I'm cool with that.

22:58.344 --> 23:00.628
No need to have any of your own.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.680
Easy there, big papa. Easy.
(light laughter)

23:02.715 --> 23:04.131
I want to make a toast.

23:04.183 --> 23:05.800
But, you know,
I should have some...

23:05.802 --> 23:06.801
Yeah, that ain't gonna happen.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.019
Give him a little drinky drink.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.353
All right.

23:09.389 --> 23:12.106
Okay.

23:12.141 --> 23:13.891
To Jeannie

23:13.943 --> 23:15.693
and my new baby sis.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.144
May she grow

23:17.196 --> 23:18.863
and flourish and...

23:18.898 --> 23:20.364
just be loved.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.699
And, of course,

23:21.734 --> 23:23.901
be, like,
extremely well dressed.

23:23.953 --> 23:27.038
Well, I think,
having you as a big bro-sis,

23:27.073 --> 23:29.240
there's not a chance

23:29.292 --> 23:32.243
that she'll ever look anything
other than fabulous.

23:32.295 --> 23:33.878
"Big bro-sis."

23:33.913 --> 23:35.796
I like that.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.334
I-I think I just heard
my dad's aorta explode.

23:40.386 --> 23:42.219
Little bit.
(chuckling)

23:42.255 --> 23:43.504
Little bit. Little bit.
Yeah. You saw that?

23:43.506 --> 23:45.423
That's what that was.
(laughter)

23:46.809 --> 23:49.894
Well, to...
to Jeannie...

23:49.929 --> 23:51.512
and Marty.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.901
And your happiness, hmm?

23:56.936 --> 23:58.235
Whatever form

23:58.271 --> 24:00.021
that may take.

24:00.023 --> 24:01.272
Truly,

24:01.324 --> 24:04.742
all I can say is that we
want that for the both of you.

24:04.777 --> 24:08.779
And to this new person, well...

24:10.450 --> 24:13.284
...we will love her

24:13.336 --> 24:15.002
completely...

24:16.539 --> 24:19.206
...and unconditionally.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.711
True words.

24:23.713 --> 24:25.096
That's beautiful, Pop.

24:25.131 --> 24:26.430
Come on. Let's put 'em up.

24:26.466 --> 24:28.049
Come on.
Let's put 'em up.

24:28.101 --> 24:29.100
Cheers.

24:37.527 --> 24:40.461
Very nice words for the girl
who blew up your lives.

24:55.912 --> 24:57.378
This was so delicious.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.246
(clears throat)
I really, really liked it.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.749
I unfortunately
did double-book tonight.

25:01.801 --> 25:03.501
And it's a work thing,
so I do have to run.

25:03.553 --> 25:06.087
But, um, thank you so much.

25:06.089 --> 25:07.254
Appreciate everything,
and thank you

25:07.306 --> 25:08.589
so much for the hospitality.

25:08.591 --> 25:10.591
Hey, Jeannie, what are you...?
(Jeannie sniffles)

25:10.643 --> 25:12.760
Jeannie.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:12.762 --> 25:13.844
Where are you going?

25:13.896 --> 25:15.096
I can't do this, Marty.

25:15.098 --> 25:16.430
Yeah, it's too late.

25:16.432 --> 25:18.432
Not this; the...
your family and...

25:18.434 --> 25:20.434
I can't... have them

25:20.486 --> 25:22.319
treating me so nice
when even I hate me.

25:22.355 --> 25:23.487
I can't...
Look.

25:23.523 --> 25:26.023
It's time, okay?
It's fucking time.

25:26.075 --> 25:28.109
We've been acting out
like a couple of teenagers.

25:28.161 --> 25:31.529
Yes, but maybe th-that's exactly how we're...
No... no, no, no, no, no.

25:31.581 --> 25:33.114
We're not gonna do it anymore.

25:33.166 --> 25:35.032
We're not, okay?

25:35.084 --> 25:36.834
We're gonna keep
our shit together

25:36.869 --> 25:38.836
in front of this kid.

25:38.871 --> 25:42.456
In front of both of these kids.

25:42.508 --> 25:44.842
We can do that.

25:46.179 --> 25:49.463
Let's just...
you know, be grown-ups.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.600
And you don't get to walk away

25:52.635 --> 25:54.301
every time you
feel something, Jeannie.

25:56.139 --> 25:58.522
Wow. Did that just come
out of Marty Kaan's mouth?

25:58.558 --> 26:00.224
Yeah.
You just said that to me?

26:00.276 --> 26:01.892
I heard myself say it, too.
It's weird.

26:01.944 --> 26:03.861
Uh, you heard it, right?
It's weird.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.062
(chuckles softly)

26:05.114 --> 26:07.148
I mean it.

26:12.705 --> 26:15.322
Ooh, shit.

26:15.324 --> 26:16.657
(chuckles) She's...

26:20.880 --> 26:22.546
(laughs)

26:22.582 --> 26:24.665
Ninja fetus.

26:27.170 --> 26:28.669
Hey.

26:30.173 --> 26:32.139
Come on.

26:36.512 --> 26:38.312
Okay.

26:39.515 --> 26:41.515
Okay.
Okay.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.520
(sighs)

26:46.572 --> 26:49.190
I told them I was having
pregnancy issues.

26:49.192 --> 26:50.991
That should shut 'em up.
Hey...

26:51.027 --> 26:53.327
And now I would like to know
what is for dessert.

26:53.362 --> 26:55.196
Of course.
(Jeremiah chuckling)

26:55.198 --> 26:57.081
How about...
Whoa.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.415
blackberry cobbler.

26:58.451 --> 26:59.867
So glad I stayed.

26:59.919 --> 27:01.535
Blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice.

27:01.587 --> 27:03.003
And right on time.
Right on time.

27:03.039 --> 27:04.505
She likes what she likes.
He's not wrong.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.207
How big a piece do
you want, Jeannie?

27:06.209 --> 27:08.542
Jeremiah, I don't think
you have a piece big enough.

27:08.544 --> 27:09.627
Are you serious?

27:09.679 --> 27:10.761
I am.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.880
Okay, well...
how is that?

27:12.882 --> 27:14.215
I'll start with that,

27:14.217 --> 27:16.300
but you're going to need
two other cobblers, I think.

27:16.352 --> 27:18.018
Oh, stop it.
