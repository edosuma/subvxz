WEBVTT

00:11.633 --> 00:13.933
- COME ON, DAD, PLEASE.

00:13.967 --> 00:15.700
HOOK A GHOST UP.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.433
- YOU KNOW.
TYPICAL KID STUFF.

00:19.467 --> 00:20.700
- UGH, BEEN THERE.

00:20.733 --> 00:22.667
- LOUIE WANTS
TO POSSESS THE CAT.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.433
- HAVE NOT BEEN THERE.

00:24.467 --> 00:26.300
- HE'S STILL A BEGINNER GHOST,

00:26.333 --> 00:27.767
SO HE NEEDS MY HELP
GETTING IN.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.000
- POSSESSING IS THE BEST PART
OF BEING A GHOST.

00:30.033 --> 00:32.900
WELL, THAT AND BEING INVISIBLE
WHEN I FART.

00:36.567 --> 00:38.733
UGH! EW!

00:38.767 --> 00:43.267
I WONDER
WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.

00:43.300 --> 00:45.000
- SON, GET OVER HERE.

00:45.033 --> 00:47.567
LET'S GIVE YOU
A LITTLE POSSESSING PRACTICE.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.600
- OH, YEAH, CAT ME.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.000
AWESOME.

00:53.033 --> 00:54.467
HEY, DAD, CHECK ME OUT.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.433
* WAVE YOUR PAWS
IN THE AIR *

00:56.467 --> 00:58.700
* POSSESS A CAT
LIKE YOU JUST DON'T CARE *

00:58.733 --> 01:01.067
- I REMEMBER A TIME
IN MY LIFE

01:01.067 --> 01:03.633
WHEN THIS WOULD
HAVE SEEMED WEIRD.

01:03.667 --> 01:07.433
- BALL OF YARN!

01:07.467 --> 01:08.833
- HEY, MOM.
HEY, RAY.

01:08.867 --> 01:10.400
- FRANKIE, YOUR VOLLEYBALL COACH
CALLED.

01:10.433 --> 01:11.567
- BYE, MOM.
BYE, RAY.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.767
- FREEZE.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.333
YOUR COACH SAID THIS TIME
YOU TRIED TO GET OUT OF PLAYING

01:16.367 --> 01:18.567
BY SAYING YOU'RE ALLERGIC
TO GYM WHISTLES?

01:18.600 --> 01:20.833
- WHISTLE-ITIS IS REAL.

01:20.867 --> 01:25.667
WHEN IS AMERICA GONNA WAKE UP
AND TACKLE THIS THING?

01:25.700 --> 01:27.533
FINE.

01:27.567 --> 01:30.067
I DON'T WANNA PLAY BECAUSE
I'M NOT VERY COORDINATED.

01:30.067 --> 01:31.567
- AH, COME ON, FRANKIE.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.433
YOU'RE JUST
BEING HARD ON YOURSELF.

01:33.467 --> 01:36.500
THINK FAST!

01:37.800 --> 01:39.500
YOU JUST WEREN'T READY.

01:39.533 --> 01:42.967
GO.

01:43.067 --> 01:45.733
I'M GONNA STOP
THROWING THINGS NOW.

01:45.767 --> 01:47.267
- TOLD YOU.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.233
I WISH I WAS GOOD
AT SPORTS LIKE TAYLOR,

01:49.267 --> 01:50.333
BUT I'M NOT.

01:50.367 --> 01:52.333
- OH, BABY, I'M SORRY.

01:52.367 --> 01:54.400
BUT PLAYING A SPORT
IS A SCHOOL REQUIREMENT.

01:54.433 --> 01:55.733
YOU HAVE TO DO IT, SWEETIE.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.433
- FINE.

01:57.467 --> 02:00.767
I'LL BE IN MY ROOM...
WORKING ON MY WILL.

02:03.633 --> 02:05.067
- I HATE GOING
TO THESE SPORTING EVENTS.

02:05.067 --> 02:06.733
IT'S TOUGH
WATCHING HER OUT THERE.

02:06.767 --> 02:07.900
POOR THING.

02:07.933 --> 02:10.867
- MAYBE TODAY WILL BE HER DAY.

02:12.967 --> 02:15.967
- OOH, A PRETZEL.

02:18.433 --> 02:20.700
YOU REALLY JUST DID THAT
BEFORE I GOT A CHANCE

02:20.733 --> 02:24.367
TO RUB MY CAT BUTT
AGAINST THE PIANO LEG?

02:24.400 --> 02:25.767
- FORGET THE CAT.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.667
I GOT SOMETHING BETTER
YOU CAN POSSESS.

02:27.700 --> 02:29.467
- FRANKIE!

02:29.500 --> 02:31.733
- YOU READY TO SPIKE
SOME VOLLEYBALLS TODAY?

02:33.067 --> 02:34.533
MY FIRST HUMAN?

02:34.567 --> 02:36.700
LOUIE IS MOVING UP
IN THE WORLD!

02:39.300 --> 02:41.300
FUR BALL.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.067
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

02:49.067 --> 02:51.867
* YOU GOTTA TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

02:51.900 --> 02:53.967
- * SO IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

02:54.067 --> 02:57.933
- * YOU GOTTA BE
ONE BIG, SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

02:57.967 --> 03:00.433
- * DON'T KNOW
HOW WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

03:00.467 --> 03:01.867
- * BUT I GUESS
YOU COULD CALL US *

03:01.900 --> 03:04.733
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

03:04.767 --> 03:07.600
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

03:07.633 --> 03:09.600
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

03:09.633 --> 03:13.367
*

03:13.400 --> 03:15.400
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

03:15.433 --> 03:17.600
*

03:23.467 --> 03:24.467
YAH!

03:24.500 --> 03:25.900
THEN THIS.
AAH!

03:25.933 --> 03:29.833
AND THEN LIKE THIS?
YAH!

03:29.867 --> 03:34.333
OUR PRESENTATION
WOULD TOTALLY GET AN "A."

03:34.367 --> 03:36.733
- YOU DO REALIZE
WE'RE DOING A HISTORY REPORT

03:36.767 --> 03:38.700
ON GEORGE WASHINGTON.

03:38.733 --> 03:41.933
- SO YOU'RE SAYING I SHOULD
DO IT WEARING A WHITE WIG?

03:41.967 --> 03:44.633
NICE.

03:44.667 --> 03:46.700
- LET'S TAKE FIVE.
GLASS OF MILK?

03:46.733 --> 03:50.067
- AH, JUST LIKE WASHINGTON
USED TO DRINK.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.967
- HMM. LET'S SEE.

03:57.067 --> 03:59.833
WHO DO WE HAVE HERE?

03:59.867 --> 04:01.467
KARATE CLUB?

04:01.500 --> 04:02.467
OH, NICE.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.367
I LOVE KARATE.

04:05.967 --> 04:07.667
I KNOW YOU CAN'T
SEE THESE MOVES,

04:07.700 --> 04:10.700
BUT TRUST ME,
THEY'RE QUITE IMPRESSIVE.

04:14.967 --> 04:16.900
HMM.

04:16.933 --> 04:19.067
THAT'S WEIRD.

04:23.067 --> 04:24.767
WHAT

04:24.800 --> 04:26.467
- WHY WOULDN'T I
BE ABLE TO SEE YOU?

04:28.533 --> 04:31.733
- FOUR.

04:31.767 --> 04:34.467
UH, WHAT COLOR'S MY SHIRT?

04:34.500 --> 04:35.567
- PURPLE.

04:35.600 --> 04:36.633
- MM. CLOSE ENOUGH. LAVENDER.

04:38.967 --> 04:41.067
I DON'T GET IT.

04:41.067 --> 04:43.900
ONLY PEOPLE LIVING
IN THE HOUSE CAN SEE ME.

04:43.933 --> 04:46.867
UNLESS...YOU'VE GOT THE GIFT!

04:46.900 --> 04:48.367
I HEARD PEOPLE LIKE YOU EXISTED.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.600
I'VE JUST NEVER MET ONE.

04:49.633 --> 04:52.433
- I'M CONFUSED.

04:53.667 --> 04:56.967
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BRING A GIFT?

04:57.067 --> 04:58.467
- NO.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.567
LOOK, I GOTTA
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.633
IT MAY SHOCK YOU,
BUT MY NAME'S MILES.

05:03.667 --> 05:06.700
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I'M A--

05:08.367 --> 05:12.900
- I'M A NORMAL, AVERAGE BOY,
JUST LIKE YOU.

05:20.667 --> 05:21.933
- JUST HAVE FUN, SWEETIE.

05:21.967 --> 05:23.433
DON'T BE A HERO.

05:23.467 --> 05:26.633
NO SHAME IN DUCKING.

05:26.667 --> 05:28.900
I ALWAYS GET SO NERVOUS FOR HER.
SHE'S SO TINY OUT THERE.

05:28.933 --> 05:30.600
THANKS FOR COMING TO SUPPORT
FRANKIE, BY THE WAY.

05:30.633 --> 05:32.867
CAN YOU GUYS TELL I'M NERVOUS?

05:32.900 --> 05:35.067
- DAD, YOU SIT NEXT TO HER.

05:35.067 --> 05:38.733
[whistle blows,
applause]

05:38.767 --> 05:40.533
- LOOK AT 'EM OVER THERE
IN THEIR LITTLE GROUP.

05:40.567 --> 05:41.833
THE COOL MOMS.

05:41.867 --> 05:43.633
YEAH, THEY THINK
THEY'RE SO COOL.

05:43.667 --> 05:45.733
THEY SHOOT ME THESE LOOKS
WHEN FRANKIE AVOIDS THE BALL,

05:45.767 --> 05:47.567
AS IF I EVEN CARE
WHAT THEY THINK.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.933
"I'M JUDGY JUDGERSON,
AND I JUDGE PEOPLE."

05:50.967 --> 05:52.600
- AT LEAST
IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU.

05:53.967 --> 05:57.067
THE MIDDLE ONE'S
TOTALLY WEARING A WIG.

05:57.067 --> 05:59.500
GO, FRANKIE!
- I DON'T WANT TO. NO.

05:59.533 --> 06:00.967
- OH.

06:01.067 --> 06:02.833
HEY, DAD, CAN YOU
TAKE ME OVER TO--

06:02.867 --> 06:07.633
UH...I MEAN,
I NEED TO SEE, UM--

06:07.667 --> 06:09.833
JUST TELL ME
WHAT I NEED TO SAY.

06:12.600 --> 06:13.933
YOU WANNA GO WATCH
FROM OVER THERE?

06:13.967 --> 06:16.967
SURE, I'LL TAKE YOU.

06:17.067 --> 06:20.833
I KNEW WE SHOULD
HAVE REHEARSED THAT MORE.

06:20.867 --> 06:23.700
READY TO GIVE FRANKIE
A LITTLE CONFIDENCE BOOST, SON?

06:23.733 --> 06:25.067
SHE NEEDS US.

06:25.067 --> 06:29.433
- JUST THROW ME IN,
AND LET ME DO MY THING.

06:29.467 --> 06:32.800
- DON'T HIT IT TO ME,
DON'T HIT IT TO ME.

06:46.433 --> 06:47.833
PEOPLE ARE CLAPPING.
WHY ARE PEOPLE CLAPPING?

06:47.867 --> 06:51.300
- YOU MAY WANT TO WATCH THIS.

07:09.067 --> 07:12.567
- WH-WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK I DID ANYTHING?

07:21.133 --> 07:24.367
OKAY, FINE.
I REALLY FELT FOR THE KID.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.067
AND I'M A PARENT TOO,
REMEMBER?

07:26.100 --> 07:27.600
AND YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT WANTING HER

07:27.633 --> 07:29.467
TO HAVE CONFIDENCE, SO...

07:29.500 --> 07:31.800
I THOUGHT I COULD
GIVE HER A TEENY BIT.

07:33.500 --> 07:34.933
[whistle blows,
cheers and applause]

07:34.967 --> 07:39.700
all: FRANKZILLA! FRANKZILLA!
FRANKZILLA!

07:39.733 --> 07:42.400
- YOU'VE TAKEN IT A LITTLE
TOO FAR, DON'T YOU THINK?

07:42.433 --> 07:45.067
YOU NEED TO END THIS
RIGHT NOW, RAY.

07:45.067 --> 07:47.867
- EXCUSE ME, BUT YOUR DAUGHTER
IS AMAZING.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.500
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US?

07:49.533 --> 07:51.267
- OKAY, YOU CAN END IT
AFTER THE GAME,

07:51.300 --> 07:54.300
BUT THEN
IT IS DEFINITELY OVER.

08:05.900 --> 08:07.633
- OKAY, I GOT ANOTHER.

08:07.667 --> 08:10.067
WHAT DO YOU CALL A PIG
WHO KNOWS KARATE?

08:10.067 --> 08:12.633
A PORK CHOP!

08:14.833 --> 08:18.067
OKAY, JAMES--WHOA, MAMA!

08:18.100 --> 08:21.100
- TAY, THIS GUY IS HYSTERICAL.

08:21.133 --> 08:22.933
- AW.

08:22.967 --> 08:24.667
- YOUR COUSIN MILES HERE.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.900
YOU KNOW WE'RE BOTH GREEN BELTS?

08:30.100 --> 08:31.933
MILES, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

08:33.433 --> 08:36.433
- COUSIN EMERGENCY.

08:39.067 --> 08:41.467
WHAT IS GOING ON?
HOW CAN HE SEE YOU?

08:41.500 --> 08:42.833
- APPARENTLY
HE'S GOT THE ABILITY

08:42.867 --> 08:45.367
TO SEE ALL GHOSTS.
HE JUST DOESN'T KNOW IT.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.867
- WAIT, SO HE DOESN'T KNOW
YOU'RE A GHOST?

08:47.900 --> 08:50.067
- NOPE.
HE SEES ME AS A REGULAR KID.

08:50.067 --> 08:51.900
- OKAY, THANK GOODNESS.

08:51.933 --> 08:53.767
WELL, LET'S MAKE SURE
WE KEEP IT THAT WAY.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.567
- SO, I GOTTA TAKE OFF NOW.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.300
- YES, GOOD IDEA.
WE'LL WORK ON OUR PROJECT

08:57.333 --> 08:58.700
ANOTHER DAY.

08:58.733 --> 09:00.667
MAYBE NEXT TIME AT THE LIBRARY
OR YOUR HOUSE.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.433
I HEAR MALL FOOD COURTS
ARE ALL THE RAGE.

09:02.467 --> 09:04.700
BYE!
- OKAY. LATER.

09:04.733 --> 09:05.867
OH!

09:05.900 --> 09:07.767
AND MILES,
SEE YOU TOMORROW, DUDE.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.567
PORK CHOP.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.567
- THAT'S FUNNY.

09:13.600 --> 09:16.067
SOUNDED LIKE HE SAID
"SEE YOU TOMORROW, DUDE."

09:16.100 --> 09:17.833
- HE DID.

09:17.867 --> 09:20.667
* I GOT A FRIEND COMING OVER

09:23.667 --> 09:25.067
- MILES!

09:25.067 --> 09:26.600
HE CAN'T COME OVER.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.467
NO ONE IS SUPPOSED
TO KNOW ABOUT YOU.

09:29.933 --> 09:31.400
HE'S NOT GONNA
FIND OUT I'M A GHOST.

09:31.433 --> 09:32.800
HOW COOL IS THIS?

09:32.833 --> 09:35.533
UP TOP.

09:35.567 --> 09:37.833
WHOA!

09:37.867 --> 09:41.867
REMIND ME,
NO HIGH FIVING TOMORROW.

09:43.367 --> 09:45.467
- LOOK, MILES, ABOUT JAMES--

09:45.500 --> 09:46.867
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:46.900 --> 09:48.100
- I KNOW YOU WORRIED ABOUT HIM

09:48.133 --> 09:49.467
FINDING OUT I WAS A GHOST,

09:49.500 --> 09:52.067
SO...

09:52.067 --> 09:53.667
PROBLEM SOLVED.

09:53.700 --> 09:55.700
IF ANYONE TRIES TO HIGH FIVE,

09:55.733 --> 09:57.067
THEIR HAND WON'T
GO THROUGH THIS.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.833
IT'LL BE POSSESSED.

09:58.867 --> 10:00.933
PRETTY SMART.

10:00.967 --> 10:03.733
- AND IF HE WANTS TO HIGH FIVE
YOUR OTHER HAND?

10:03.767 --> 10:06.467
- BAM!

10:06.500 --> 10:10.467
HEY, ANYONE SEE
ANY GHOSTS AROUND HERE?

10:10.500 --> 10:12.600
"I SURE HAVEN'T.

10:12.633 --> 10:16.033
ALL I SEE IS A GUY WHO CAN
HIGH FIVE WITH BOTH HANDS."

10:16.067 --> 10:18.900
- MILES, PUT THE PUPPET DOWN
AND LISTEN TO ME.

10:18.933 --> 10:21.467
WHAT IF JAMES FINDS OUT
THE HOUSE IS HAUNTED?

10:21.500 --> 10:23.000
IT'LL RUIN EVERYTHING.

10:23.033 --> 10:26.033
- "DRAMA QUEEN."

10:27.067 --> 10:28.833
- I'M SERIOUS.

10:28.867 --> 10:30.467
HE CAN'T FIND OUT
YOU'RE A GHOST.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.500
- I UNDERSTAND.

10:33.533 --> 10:34.933
YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.600
I'LL CALL JAMES AND CANCEL.

10:36.633 --> 10:38.433
- THANKS, MILES.
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

10:38.467 --> 10:40.400
- MM-HMM.

10:43.400 --> 10:47.033
"YOU'RE NOT GONNA
CALL AND CANCEL, ARE YOU?"

10:48.067 --> 10:50.300
SHH.

10:51.733 --> 10:56.533
- FRANKIE, FRANKIE,
FRANKIE, FRANKIE.

10:57.933 --> 11:00.800
- WHAT A FUN DAY, HONEY.

11:00.833 --> 11:02.333
AREN'T YOU GLAD
YOU PLAYED TODAY?

11:02.367 --> 11:05.100
- IT WAS AWESOME,
THANKS TO THESE GUYS.

11:05.133 --> 11:07.700
- YOU'RE A LOT MORE FUN
TO POSSESS THAN A CAT.

11:07.733 --> 11:10.600
CATS CAN'T MOONWALK.

11:12.133 --> 11:14.067
- WELL, I'M GONNA GO MAKE
YOUR FAVORITE DESSERT,

11:14.067 --> 11:16.400
CHOCOLATE POUND CAKE,
BECAUSE YOUR TEAM WON.

11:16.433 --> 11:17.667
NOT THAT WINNING IS IMPORTANT.

11:17.700 --> 11:20.500
BUT YOU WON!

11:20.533 --> 11:22.767
- SO, AT TOMORROW'S GAME,

11:22.800 --> 11:26.067
I WAS THINKING WE'D TRY
A BEHIND THE BACK SPIKE.

11:26.100 --> 11:30.067
ALSO, COULD YOU MAKE ME
BREATHE FIRE?

11:30.100 --> 11:33.100
- WHOA,
TODAY WAS A ONE TIME THING.

11:33.133 --> 11:35.600
BESIDES, I HAVE TO GO TO
A PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCE

11:35.633 --> 11:36.933
FOR THE BOYS'
GHOST TUTOR TOMORROW.

11:36.967 --> 11:38.533
CAN'T MAKE YOUR GAME.

11:38.567 --> 11:41.500
- THEN I CAN'T MAKE IT EITHER.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.367
DARN.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.467
NO MORE VOLLEYBALL FOR ME.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.400
- COME HERE.

11:54.433 --> 11:57.067
TAKE THAT OFF.

11:57.067 --> 12:00.367
I'LL ADMIT, WHEN I WAS BOUNCING
APPLES OFF YOUR HEAD TODAY

12:00.400 --> 12:02.567
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.067
BUT I WAS WATCHING YOU TODAY

12:04.067 --> 12:06.833
AND IT WASN'T JUST LOUIE
OUT THERE ON THAT COURT.

12:06.867 --> 12:08.900
YOU PLAYED A PART IN IT TOO.

12:08.933 --> 12:10.667
YOU'LL BE FINE ON YOUR OWN.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.800
YOU JUST NEED TO BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF, OKAY?

12:12.833 --> 12:15.367
- I GUESS.

12:19.500 --> 12:23.467
- NO OFFENSE,
BUT HE WAS JUST BEING NICE.

12:23.500 --> 12:26.833
IT WAS ALL ME OUT THERE TODAY.

12:29.133 --> 12:30.733
- TAYLOR, YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO LEAVE

12:30.767 --> 12:32.333
FIVE MINUTES AGO FOR PRACTICE.

12:32.367 --> 12:34.367
LET'S GO.

12:45.600 --> 12:46.900
WHY SO JUMPY?

12:46.933 --> 12:50.067
- I'M NOT JUMPY.

12:50.067 --> 12:52.467
OKAY THEN.
BYE.

12:52.500 --> 12:56.367
- HEY, TAYLOR.
- HEY, JAMES.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.867
JAMES,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:58.900 --> 13:00.400
- I'M HERE TO HANG WITH MILES.

13:00.433 --> 13:02.500
UP TOP, BUDDY.

13:02.533 --> 13:04.533
- NO!

13:07.400 --> 13:08.533
- YEAH.

13:08.567 --> 13:11.100
UM, SORRY TO STOP
THAT HIGH FIVE,

13:11.133 --> 13:12.933
BUT MILES IS GETTING OVER A COLD

13:12.967 --> 13:14.767
AND I AM VERY PASSIONATE
WHEN IT COMES TO GERMS.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.500
- I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT GUM.

13:21.067 --> 13:25.500
- OH, ONLY TO REMIND ME
TO BRING SILENT NINJA 4.

13:25.533 --> 13:28.100
OH, AND TO COME IN
AFTER TAYLOR LEFT.

13:28.133 --> 13:30.133
OH...

13:42.267 --> 13:44.300
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
CANCEL WITH JAMES.

13:44.333 --> 13:47.367
- AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
MAKE IT TO GYMNASTICS ON TIME.

13:47.400 --> 13:50.067
I FEEL LIKE WE WERE ALL MISLED.

13:50.100 --> 13:52.900
- MILES, LET ME
GIVE YOU TWO REASONS

13:52.933 --> 13:55.067
WHY HAVING HIM OVER
IS A HORRIBLE IDEA.

13:55.067 --> 13:56.900
ONE.

13:56.933 --> 13:58.600
AND TWO.

13:58.633 --> 14:00.400
- LOOK.

14:00.433 --> 14:04.333
IS IT A PERFECT SITUATION?
NO.

14:04.367 --> 14:05.767
BUT WHEN YOU FIRST MOVED HERE

14:05.800 --> 14:06.800
AND WERE WORRIED
ABOUT MAKING FRIENDS,

14:06.833 --> 14:08.233
I HAD YOUR BACK.

14:08.267 --> 14:12.067
IT'D BE NICE
IF YOU DID THE SAME FOR ME.

14:12.067 --> 14:15.200
- MILES, CHECK IT OUT.

14:15.233 --> 14:17.267
I BROUGHT MY KARATE GEAR OVER.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.333
WE CAN SPAR TOGETHER, DUDE.

14:19.367 --> 14:22.900
SPAR?

14:22.933 --> 14:25.367
WITH FOAM FINGERS
AND SOCK PUPPETS?

14:25.400 --> 14:26.900
- NO.

14:26.933 --> 14:28.900
HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT.

14:28.933 --> 14:32.367
I KNOW YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD,
SO GO EASY ON ME.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.933
- TRUST ME, JAMES,
YOU WON'T FEEL A THING.

14:38.967 --> 14:40.700
- EXCUSE ME.

14:40.733 --> 14:42.200
COOL MOM COMING THROUGH.

14:42.233 --> 14:43.700
WATCH YOUR BACK.

14:43.733 --> 14:44.967
COOL MOM HERE.

14:45.067 --> 14:46.600
- THERE SHE IS.

14:46.633 --> 14:49.100
MICHELE, YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

14:49.133 --> 14:50.967
THAT DRESS.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.367
I BROUGHT POPCORN.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.833
- YAY.
all: YAY.

14:57.867 --> 15:00.767
FRANKIE'S COME SO FAR,
SO FAST.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.700
DOES SHE GET HER AMAZING
ATHLETIC TALENTS FROM YOU?

15:02.733 --> 15:04.867
- I GUESS I'D BE BRAGGING
IF I SAID YES.

15:08.967 --> 15:10.433
HELLO, SIR.

15:10.467 --> 15:12.300
HOW ARE YOU?

15:12.333 --> 15:15.167
all: FRANKZILLA! FRANKZILLA!

15:15.200 --> 15:17.133
- YOUR DAUGHTER LOOKS
A LITTLE NERVOUS DOWN THERE.

15:17.167 --> 15:20.167
IS SHE GONNA BE OKAY?

15:23.400 --> 15:26.067
- SHE'S JUST TRYING TO PSYCH
THE OTHER TEAM OUT.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.700
WOULD YOU LADIES
EXCUSE ME A SEC?

15:36.367 --> 15:37.900
ARE YOU GOING TO A WEDDING
OR SOMETHING?

15:37.933 --> 15:41.367
- THIS OLD--NEVER MIND.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.100
WHERE'S RAY?

15:43.133 --> 15:44.767
- PARENT-TEACHER MEETINGS.

15:45.933 --> 15:47.267
I-I THOUGHT HE'D BE HERE

15:47.300 --> 15:49.100
DOING HIS LITTLE GHOSTY THING
FOR FRANKIE.

15:49.133 --> 15:51.967
LOOK AT THAT AMAZON.

15:52.067 --> 15:54.267
NOT YOU, MA'AM.
YOU'RE VERY SVELTE.

15:54.300 --> 15:55.900
- DON'T WORRY.

15:55.933 --> 15:57.667
FRANKIE'S GONNA GET
A LITTLE HELP

15:57.700 --> 16:01.067
FROM GUY SOME PEOPLE HAVE
STARTED CALLING "AIR LOUIE."

16:01.100 --> 16:04.100
- ME.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.300
HEY, THIS ISN'T FRANKIE.

16:10.333 --> 16:12.367
IT SMELLS IN HERE.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.200
WHERE AM I?

16:21.267 --> 16:23.767
- MY BABY'S OUT THERE ALL ALONE.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.900
SHE'S GONNA GET CRUSHED.

16:25.933 --> 16:27.200
STOP THE GAME!

16:27.233 --> 16:31.067
MOMMY TIME OUT!

16:32.633 --> 16:34.367
- DON'T WORRY,
MY PRECIOUS ANGEL.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.600
MAMA'S HERE.

16:35.633 --> 16:36.733
NO ONE'S GONNA HURT YOU.

16:43.333 --> 16:45.367
- MILES, YOU HAVE TO
LISTEN TO ME.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.367
GHOSTS CAN'T SPAR.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.800
THIS IS GOING TO END BADLY.

16:47.833 --> 16:49.267
- WHOO.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.800
ALL RIGHT.

16:50.833 --> 16:53.967
IT'S TIME TO PARTY
LIKE IT'S 1999.

16:54.067 --> 16:56.767
GEORGE WASHINGTON SAID THAT.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.133
- NO, HE DIDN'T.

16:59.167 --> 17:02.867
- TAYLOR, ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS AVOID PHYSICAL CONTACT.

17:02.900 --> 17:05.800
HOW HARD CAN THAT BE?

17:05.833 --> 17:09.833
- WA! AH! AH!

17:12.400 --> 17:16.600
- EXCUSE ME FOR A SEC.

17:16.633 --> 17:18.067
DID YOU JUST SEE THAT?

17:18.067 --> 17:20.167
MY FOAM FINGER
CAN'T DEFEND AGAINST THAT.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.367
- SORRY, MILES.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.967
THIS IS WHAT
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT.

17:23.067 --> 17:24.233
- ALL I WANTED WAS TO HANG OUT

17:24.267 --> 17:27.367
LIKE A REGULAR KID
FOR JUST ONE DAY.

17:30.867 --> 17:35.167
CAN YOU JUST TELL JAMES
THAT I WENT HOME?

17:35.200 --> 17:37.100
- NO.

17:38.267 --> 17:40.167
- I MEAN I GOT YOUR BACK.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.667
YOU WANNA HANG OUT
WITH KARATE KID,

17:41.700 --> 17:43.233
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO.

17:43.267 --> 17:45.600
FOLLOW MY LEAD.

17:45.633 --> 17:49.067
SO JAMES, ARE YOU INTERESTED
IN SERIOUS MARTIAL ARTS?

17:49.100 --> 17:54.100
MILES ONLY PRACTICES THE MYSTIC,
ANCIENT ART OF...GAKAMATO.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.900
- EXACTLY.

18:00.067 --> 18:01.767
IT'S AN ANCIENT KARATE TECHNIQUE

18:01.800 --> 18:03.400
WHERE YOU SPAR BLINDFOLDED.

18:03.433 --> 18:06.767
ONLY IN TOTAL DARKNESS WILL
YOUR OTHER SENSES COME ALIVE.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.233
AND ONLY THEN WILL YOU BE ABLE
TO ACHIEVE THE LEVEL OF...

18:09.267 --> 18:13.200
DUNGEON MASTER...TACO SUPREME.

18:14.933 --> 18:17.933
- I SO WANT THAT!

18:19.267 --> 18:20.600
YOU READY, MILES?

18:20.633 --> 18:21.867
- I GUESS SO.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.067
MISSED ME.

18:23.100 --> 18:26.300
NOTHING BUT AIR.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.067
- DUDE, YOU'RE FAST.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.133
- WA!

18:31.100 --> 18:34.100
- RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

18:41.367 --> 18:43.100
IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?

18:43.133 --> 18:45.067
YAH!
- OW!

18:45.100 --> 18:48.733
THAT HURT.

18:48.767 --> 18:52.167
UH, I KNOW YOU KIDS
WANNA START YOUR MOVIE NOW.

18:52.200 --> 18:56.067
- NOT YET.
THIS IS TOO MUCH FUN.

18:56.100 --> 18:57.933
- OOH!
- MISSED ME.

18:57.967 --> 19:00.867
I MEAN, GOT ME, GOT ME.

19:00.900 --> 19:04.900
YOU DEFINITELY JUST MADE CONTACT
WITH MY SOLID FORM.

19:06.433 --> 19:09.433
WE SHOULD TAKE A BREAK.

19:09.467 --> 19:11.400
- WHOO.

19:11.433 --> 19:13.667
AWESOME SPARRING SESSION, MAN.

19:13.700 --> 19:16.333
- BEST ONE I'VE HAD
IN A LONG TIME.

19:16.367 --> 19:17.433
AWESOME.

19:17.467 --> 19:19.433
I'M GONNA GO GET SOME ICE.

19:19.467 --> 19:21.467
FOR MILES.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.800
I CAN'T SEE.

19:29.833 --> 19:33.200
I DO NOT CARE FOR THIS.

19:33.233 --> 19:35.833
- FRANKIE, COME OUT FROM THERE.

19:35.867 --> 19:37.200
- NOT A CHANCE.

19:37.233 --> 19:38.700
YOU HUMILIATED ME.

19:38.733 --> 19:40.200
- I'M PROTECTING YOU.

19:40.233 --> 19:44.233
THOSE GIRLS ON THE OTHER TEAM
LOOK LIKE FROST GIANTS.

19:46.233 --> 19:49.433
- EVERY KID IN SCHOOL SAW YOU
RUN OUT ON THE COURT.

19:49.467 --> 19:51.733
I'LL NEVER LIVE THAT DOWN.

19:54.067 --> 19:56.433
UH-OH.
CHERYL JUST GOT HURT.

19:56.467 --> 19:58.333
- INJURY SUBSTITUTION.

19:58.367 --> 19:59.833
FRANKIE, WE NEED YOU.

19:59.867 --> 20:01.867
- WALK IT OFF, CHERYL.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.433
- FRANKIE, LET'S GO.

20:03.467 --> 20:04.733
NEXT POINT WINS.

20:04.767 --> 20:06.267
all: FRANKZILLA.

20:06.300 --> 20:07.433
FRANKZILLA.

20:07.467 --> 20:10.233
- SORRY.
NO CAN DO.

20:11.700 --> 20:14.733
- HEY!
I MADE THAT POPCORN!

20:14.767 --> 20:16.600
- MOM, I'M GOING OUT THERE.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.267
- HONEY, NO.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.900
I SHOULDN'T HAVE MADE YOU PLAY.

20:19.933 --> 20:22.200
- I'M SCARED TOO,

20:22.233 --> 20:24.967
BUT RAY TOLD ME THAT PART
OF ME WAS SPIKING THAT BALL

20:25.000 --> 20:28.733
THE OTHER DAY AND ALL I NEEDED
WAS A LITTLE CONFIDENCE.

20:28.767 --> 20:31.133
MAYBE HE'S RIGHT.

20:31.167 --> 20:33.767
- MAYBE HE IS.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.367
YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN DO IT?

20:35.400 --> 20:39.300
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

20:39.333 --> 20:42.333
- GO GET 'EM, TIGER.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.200
- DON'T WORRY, MICHELLE.

20:46.233 --> 20:49.033
AIR LOUIE IS GONNA SAVE THE DAY.

21:04.067 --> 21:07.400
- I GOT IT!
I GOT IT!

21:17.733 --> 21:21.067
- THAT'S MY DAUGHTER, EVERYONE!

21:29.067 --> 21:30.267
- I'M COMING, FRANKIE.

21:30.300 --> 21:33.300
I GOT YOUR BACK.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.900
- JUST PROMISE NEXT TIME
YOU WANNA MAKE A FRIEND

21:43.933 --> 21:45.800
YOU'LL FIND A KID
WHO'S INTO JOURNALING.

21:45.833 --> 21:47.400
- DON'T WORRY.

21:47.433 --> 21:50.433
I TOLD JAMES I WAS JUST VISITING
AND GOING BACK HOME AFTER TODAY.

21:50.467 --> 21:52.167
TRYING TO BE A REGULAR KID

21:52.200 --> 21:54.300
WAS WAY HARDER
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

21:54.333 --> 21:56.167
ONE DAY, I'LL BE READY FOR IT.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.367
NOT NOW THOUGH.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.233
- BUT WHAT ABOUT WANTING

21:59.267 --> 22:00.800
TO FIND A FRIEND TO HANG WITH?

22:00.833 --> 22:03.067
- I ALREADY GOT ONE.

22:03.067 --> 22:04.767
- YOU'RE ABOUT TO HIGH FIVE ME

22:04.800 --> 22:05.933
WITH THAT SOCK PUPPET,
AREN'T YOU?

22:05.967 --> 22:08.967
- "BRING IT."
