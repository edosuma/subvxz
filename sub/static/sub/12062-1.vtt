00:44.009 --> 00:49.003
Starring: James Franco
Katherine Kina, Faron Goodson

00:53.419 --> 01:00.655
Title: Wacky DNA

01:00.826 --> 01:03.624
Sometimes it's hard to know where you are.

01:04.696 --> 01:11.465
What are you doing, where are you going?
Even when it's time

01:15.007 --> 01:18.340
It's often hard to remember what you've done in the past.

01:18.944 --> 01:21.139
Or what I want to do next

01:21.914 --> 01:25.714
The next night is like the more abstract concept

01:25.818 --> 01:29.219
I do not even have time to think about it.

01:31.056 --> 01:34.355
The weather is mild and the sun is rising.

01:34.460 --> 01:37.861
The ocean is beautiful and everything is going well.

01:38.697 --> 01:44.260
At point A, you are someone At
point B, you are someone else.

01:44.369 --> 01:49.272
At point C, you become another level...

01:49.808 --> 01:56.270
Angle, fragment, field, area

01:57.950 --> 02:00.783
Some people are very good at converting

02:00.886 --> 02:02.319
Such a break

02:03.722 --> 02:10.184
Others are harmed and unable to do so.

02:25.077 --> 02:26.840
How are you today? James

02:29.915 --> 02:35.217
Where is he? I feel shrunken on my back.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.652
I do not understand where he is.

02:37.756 --> 02:40.156
Do you know where you are? James

02:43.228 --> 02:48.222
Of course New York I
mean, California.

02:48.333 --> 02:51.325
You're not in California, but that does not matter.

02:52.137 --> 02:54.537
Did you sleep well last night? James

02:54.640 --> 02:56.938
I mean, are you asleep?

02:57.042 --> 02:58.407
I slept very well, thank you.

02:59.211 --> 03:02.942
Who is he? Why are you asking these questions?

03:03.048 --> 03:04.948
Can you hear it? James

03:05.584 --> 03:10.783
I have nothing, of course I can hear.
I heard your voice

03:13.759 --> 03:18.458
So many questions are really hard to freak out

03:21.500 --> 03:25.869
I can certainly hear, everyone can hear.

03:27.005 --> 03:29.235
What about your arm? James

03:32.578 --> 03:34.136
Arm?

03:37.416 --> 03:39.475
Is not the arm here?

03:41.420 --> 03:44.548
Look, is not it?

03:45.624 --> 03:47.615
Ok look

03:48.360 --> 03:50.794
Are they still running smoothly? James

03:51.363 --> 03:57.359
Of course, in good
condition Can also fold

03:57.469 --> 03:59.494
Very normal

04:01.073 --> 04:02.631
Why did you ask my arm?

04:02.741 --> 04:07.269
Just confirm, James.
Confirm your arm.

04:09.114 --> 04:13.141
Is that you? James, his people

04:13.252 --> 04:14.480
My people?

04:16.988 --> 04:22.859
My people? I'm here
Right behind the arm

04:24.663 --> 04:30.898
It's just that my people are not as full as their arms.
a little confused

04:31.003 --> 04:33.733
It's not always here.

04:34.473 --> 04:38.102
I can not wear it all the time.

04:41.947 --> 04:45.474
Do you really know where you are? James

04:48.620 --> 04:50.645
There are so many problems

04:54.926 --> 04:59.386
This is the story of an actor
He is no longer acting

05:00.866 --> 05:04.802
This is a story about your sister.
She is always...

05:04.903 --> 05:06.393
Come without a trace

05:08.974 --> 05:11.306
This is a story about his friend.

05:12.177 --> 05:13.769
And its neighbors

05:13.879 --> 05:16.939
I'm not sure I can tell Michael that.

05:17.049 --> 05:19.347
I can not forget the fact that he killed his stepmother.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.645
Entering and leaving home

05:26.058 --> 05:28.356
Tight to each other

05:29.861 --> 05:31.692
Intimacy

05:31.797 --> 05:33.594
Tolerance

05:33.699 --> 05:35.360
Patience

05:35.467 --> 05:37.492
Restless

05:37.602 --> 05:39.092
Even broke

05:42.741 --> 05:44.276
How can anyone know?

05:44.276 --> 05:46.478
How can anyone know?
These photos are in the town of Gayana Jones.

05:46.478 --> 05:46.578
How can anyone know?

05:46.578 --> 05:46.778
How can anyone know?
Filmed a few hours after the collective suicide

05:46.778 --> 05:49.269
How can anyone know?
Filmed a few hours after the collective suicide

05:49.381 --> 05:52.009
900 swollen bodies stacked on the floor

05:52.117 --> 05:54.449
Including 200 children

05:54.553 --> 05:58.546
There is a bucket full of cyanide nearby.

05:58.657 --> 06:01.455
A few months ago, Pastor Jim Jones was in...

06:01.560 --> 06:03.391
- San Francisco People's Temple...
(I.e.

06:03.495 --> 06:04.757
Proverbs in the pulpit

06:04.863 --> 06:08.196
His followers are mostly poor blacks...

06:08.300 --> 06:10.325
Donate Your Property

06:25.817 --> 06:26.806
James

06:26.918 --> 06:28.249
What happened?

06:28.353 --> 06:29.342
James

06:29.454 --> 06:32.218
- What is it?
- We're watching TV, thank you.

06:32.324 --> 06:33.416
(I.e.

06:33.525 --> 06:34.856
You blocked the TV.

06:51.710 --> 06:54.474
"James, how are you doing this?"
As?

06:54.579 --> 06:55.637
The flash is so bright

06:55.747 --> 06:58.011
Are we watching TV?

06:58.116 --> 06:59.606
She likes the pictures taken.

06:59.718 --> 07:00.707
Right? Patricia

07:00.819 --> 07:01.911
Right

07:02.020 --> 07:03.180
Look

07:04.723 --> 07:06.452
Where did the white shirt come from?

07:07.292 --> 07:08.589
- This one?
- right

07:09.728 --> 07:11.059
This shirt is blue

07:12.831 --> 07:14.355
OK

07:14.466 --> 07:17.162
What are you doing? To wash clothes

07:17.269 --> 07:18.964
I have a little time now.

07:19.070 --> 07:23.473
I just want to help you bend your shirt.

07:24.743 --> 07:28.144
I know I'm wearing a white shirt today.

07:28.246 --> 07:30.680
But I prefer the blue answer.

07:31.349 --> 07:34.443
Blue, thanks for helping me fold clothes.

07:34.553 --> 07:36.588
Do you believe in Jim Jones?

07:36.588 --> 07:37.222
"Agricultural Project of Education of the Temple of the People"
Do you believe in Jim Jones?

07:37.222 --> 07:37.322
"Agricultural Project of Education of the Temple of the People"

07:37.322 --> 07:38.290
"Agricultural Project of Education of the Temple of the People"
Too much

07:38.290 --> 07:38.390
"Agricultural Project of Education of the Temple of the People"

07:38.390 --> 07:39.157
"Agricultural Project of Education of the Temple of the People"
What happened?

07:39.157 --> 07:39.885
What happened?

07:39.991 --> 07:42.721
This pastor of St. Francis, Jim Jones

07:42.828 --> 07:45.319
Created a hippie church or something

07:45.430 --> 07:50.265
He and his followers left San Francisco

07:50.368 --> 07:53.929
I moved somewhere in South America

07:54.039 --> 07:55.563
Where did they move? Patricia

07:57.409 --> 07:58.671
- Patricia - Ghana

07:58.777 --> 08:02.543
Is Ghana right?
Patricia That's right

08:02.647 --> 08:06.845
In short, they all moved in and then...
My God.

08:07.686 --> 08:09.449
Strange things happened, all of them...

08:09.554 --> 08:12.648
They committed suicide, a total of 900 people

08:12.757 --> 08:15.385
I mean, who's going to leave San Francisco?

08:15.494 --> 08:17.359
Entering the jungles of South America?

08:17.462 --> 08:19.225
Still following this type of person

08:20.499 --> 08:24.196
He has thick hair.

08:24.302 --> 08:27.863
Do not be funny, James.
These talents are dead.

08:27.973 --> 08:31.170
- Just died - I know,
I just want to say...

08:31.276 --> 08:33.403
What to say? Those people

08:33.511 --> 08:36.379
Follow this guy from San Francisco

08:36.481 --> 08:38.847
In the depths of the jungles of South America

08:38.950 --> 08:42.885
All because he has thick hair

08:42.988 --> 08:46.253
Yes, it is not good.

08:48.660 --> 08:52.323
God, you feel very upset.
Thick hair

08:52.430 --> 08:53.590
I mean...

08:54.165 --> 08:55.894
No

08:56.001 --> 08:58.595
James...

09:02.407 --> 09:03.499
I am only...

09:11.149 --> 09:12.844
You really do not like people touching you, right?

09:12.951 --> 09:14.077
Right

09:15.353 --> 09:17.253
I go...

09:17.355 --> 09:18.822
I'm going to the kitchen for a glass of water.

09:21.359 --> 09:22.348
I'm going to pour a glass of water.

09:22.460 --> 09:23.552
Go ahead

09:25.030 --> 09:26.361
Do you want to drink?

09:26.464 --> 09:28.728
Okay, I also want to drink water.

09:31.570 --> 09:32.969
You know, I have a sense of accomplishment today.

09:34.105 --> 09:36.767
I thought a lot when I was walking.

09:38.410 --> 09:44.838
So I almost finished an entire article.

09:45.383 --> 09:46.680
I mean, do you believe that?

09:46.785 --> 09:48.810
I can finish an entire hike with a walk.

09:49.854 --> 09:52.584
I'm walking at the same time

09:53.024 --> 09:56.391
Did you know that some people love to use the word "simultaneously"?

09:56.494 --> 09:59.657
In the UK, people love to say at the same time

09:59.764 --> 10:02.198
For example

10:02.300 --> 10:05.895
When I ate, the phone rang.

10:06.304 --> 10:09.865
Replace "between" with "media"

10:09.975 --> 10:13.138
I'm eating at the same time

10:13.244 --> 10:17.476
Between the main course and dessert, the phone rang

10:17.582 --> 10:19.379
Yes that's right.

10:21.720 --> 10:24.086
You know, I really like your photo.

10:24.189 --> 10:26.248
Thank you, I also like it.

10:28.460 --> 10:30.360
- A ship - This is a ship.

10:32.597 --> 10:35.293
- a sailing boat -
belongs to a fleet

10:38.003 --> 10:39.265
At sea

10:39.904 --> 10:41.303
At sea

10:43.775 --> 10:46.938
- Atlantic - Not the
Atlantic, James

10:47.045 --> 10:48.910
I told you.

10:49.014 --> 10:51.175
Do you remember what it is?

10:54.986 --> 10:57.181
Indian Ocean

10:57.288 --> 10:58.118
Right

10:58.223 --> 11:01.090
Dolphins and whales in the sea

11:04.295 --> 11:06.195
There is also the protagonist of the beluga whale

11:09.768 --> 11:13.135
Okay, I'll pour water.

11:17.909 --> 11:20.309
James is full of anxiety

11:21.279 --> 11:23.804
Sometimes it's very easy to leave

11:24.649 --> 11:27.447
The simplest thing can also form a storm

11:27.552 --> 11:29.110
Restless moment

11:29.220 --> 11:33.520
Hey, do you want to use a glass or a cup of tea?

11:34.559 --> 11:39.189
I want to use water when I want to put water.

11:39.297 --> 11:40.787
High water cup

11:42.434 --> 11:43.958
Not a cup of tea

11:45.503 --> 11:47.937
High water cup

11:50.208 --> 11:52.608
a glass of water in a tall glass of water

11:58.349 --> 12:03.787
Tall glass of water, not a cup of tea

12:07.459 --> 12:10.223
I found this way from the kitchen to the living room.

12:10.328 --> 12:15.322
Always confused me Although
crossing the kitchen aisle

12:15.433 --> 12:20.200
It's a straight line in the living room.

12:21.573 --> 12:23.939
The hallway still intrigues me.

12:24.576 --> 12:28.239
It is neither a kitchen nor a living room

12:28.346 --> 12:30.211
Only one corridor

12:30.882 --> 12:37.185
The hallway is between the kitchen and the living room

12:38.123 --> 12:39.556
What happened to the hall?

12:40.558 --> 12:46.463
Oh, it's more than it seems.

12:46.564 --> 12:47.622
I know

12:50.201 --> 12:51.668
This glass is for you.

12:51.770 --> 12:52.896
Thank you

12:53.972 --> 12:55.303
Give this cup to me

12:57.442 --> 12:58.500
Go ahead

12:58.610 --> 12:59.634
Thank you

13:01.813 --> 13:02.973
Oh...

13:18.496 --> 13:20.293
Suddenly, I felt I was not so thirsty.

13:20.398 --> 13:21.422
Oh...

13:22.000 --> 13:23.194
I do not know

13:35.013 --> 13:36.981
Does that make you feel better? James

13:38.550 --> 13:41.075
a soft microphone dial sound

13:41.886 --> 13:44.787
"Are you going to disappoint me?"
"You know you will."

13:45.523 --> 13:46.717
What is going to be?

13:50.795 --> 13:51.955
I do not know

14:53.091 --> 14:55.651
Patricia, this is my place.

15:17.649 --> 15:18.638
Good Morning

15:18.750 --> 15:19.842
Sleep well at night?

15:19.951 --> 15:22.545
Not bad, and you?

15:23.454 --> 15:26.685
"Hey, you can. That's good.

15:26.791 --> 15:30.727
I woke up at 2:38 in the morning.

15:30.828 --> 15:31.920
Uh

15:32.964 --> 15:34.955
It's about 2:38 in the morning.

15:35.066 --> 15:36.431
Or is it really 2:38?

15:36.534 --> 15:38.764
It's 2:38 because I watched the clock.

15:38.870 --> 15:40.098
OK

15:40.204 --> 15:41.501
Yes

15:42.006 --> 15:43.803
How are you sleeping? Patricia

15:43.908 --> 15:48.140
I can hear your radio on and off in my room.

15:48.246 --> 15:50.510
- It's like a Morse password
- Okay

15:50.615 --> 15:54.676
I turned on the radio and tried to guess.

15:54.786 --> 15:56.651
When will the next song be played?

15:56.754 --> 16:00.656
But if I open it, it's an advertisement.

16:02.026 --> 16:05.018
So I have to turn it off.

16:05.129 --> 16:06.027
(I.e.

16:06.130 --> 16:07.529
So

16:08.533 --> 16:11.866
It's like you're doing
something Though it's not

16:11.970 --> 16:14.939
You do not turn the radio off

16:15.039 --> 16:19.373
Turn the switch off, you did it at least.

16:20.044 --> 16:22.512
Makes sense, James, Catherine is right.

16:22.613 --> 16:25.446
So many things, at least one piece was completed.

16:26.484 --> 16:27.644
Which one?

16:28.252 --> 16:30.743
- Change my radio?
"That's right.

16:31.356 --> 16:34.917
I just want to focus on writing more.

16:36.794 --> 16:38.455
Is that you? Patricia

16:38.563 --> 16:41.691
I heard you turn on the radio for a while.

16:41.799 --> 16:43.494
I did some work.

16:44.502 --> 16:46.129
What work?

16:46.237 --> 16:47.499
My work

16:48.506 --> 16:50.440
Excuse me, what work?

16:50.541 --> 16:52.566
"What are you busy with?"
- Some things about me

16:52.677 --> 16:53.974
She also has her own business.

16:54.078 --> 16:55.545
Some things related to notebook

16:55.646 --> 16:57.307
Yes I know

16:57.415 --> 17:01.852
I'm just wondering with what big things she's busy with.

17:01.953 --> 17:03.750
It's these things.
- OK

17:09.093 --> 17:10.458
What the hell is she doing?

17:10.560 --> 17:13.428
I do not know who knows

17:14.665 --> 17:15.996
How can anyone know?

17:22.874 --> 17:24.637
How can anyone know?

17:30.081 --> 17:35.542
How can anyone know?
I know it's cold.

17:38.456 --> 17:40.321
I noticed that.

17:46.864 --> 17:51.130
Emotion

18:15.359 --> 18:20.092
You have a way of getting your hair matted, right?

18:20.798 --> 18:23.062
It's a disaster.
- right

18:23.167 --> 18:27.331
No, the hairstyle is good, very beautiful.

18:27.438 --> 18:32.205
I just do not know where to start.

18:33.478 --> 18:36.208
Do you think James is okay?

18:37.882 --> 18:39.474
Why are you asking this?

18:40.118 --> 18:44.248
I sometimes worry about him.

18:47.492 --> 18:49.016
He is not bad

18:54.499 --> 18:55.591
I guess

20:00.031 --> 20:02.397
God, what happened?

20:10.441 --> 20:12.966
Lots of pills, how many pills are there?

20:13.077 --> 20:17.207
This is the moment At
point A, you are someone

20:17.315 --> 20:19.909
At point B, you are someone else.

20:20.017 --> 20:24.283
At point C, you become another level...

20:24.388 --> 20:29.485
Angle, fragment, field, area

20:29.594 --> 20:31.858
James, look there.

20:31.963 --> 20:33.624
Make sure that all of you have been picked up

20:34.599 --> 20:36.931
You do not want to leave your boss angry, right?

20:37.034 --> 20:38.763
No, I do not want this.

21:11.535 --> 21:15.027
Okay, how much better? James

21:15.640 --> 21:20.236
Much better, much better, I can

21:20.344 --> 21:22.812
I will not forget to pay.

21:24.215 --> 21:25.648
Are you still inside?

21:28.085 --> 21:30.485
You can not do this
How did you do it?

21:30.588 --> 21:33.455
Mr. Police, he broke into my shop and made a mess.

21:33.557 --> 21:36.219
- Who is going to pay that?
"I... I'll pay, I..."

21:36.327 --> 21:38.693
How much will I pay?

21:38.796 --> 21:40.627
Mr. Police, I'm sorry.

21:40.731 --> 21:42.164
I'm your aunt.

21:42.266 --> 21:43.893
This child... he's not very comfortable.

21:44.001 --> 21:45.229
- In fact...
- What's his aunt?

21:45.336 --> 21:47.201
Yes, sir, I'm your aunt.

21:47.305 --> 21:50.433
We live very close, he is a child

21:50.541 --> 21:52.509
Mr. Sanik, I'm sorry to cause you loss.

21:52.610 --> 21:54.908
I promise to repay you.

21:55.012 --> 21:57.344
Come on, I have to get him home.

22:08.125 --> 22:11.686
Crazy, do not forget your camera.

22:12.296 --> 22:15.163
He's not crazy, give me the camera.

22:19.704 --> 22:23.071
Pay attention to your attitude, young

22:23.174 --> 22:24.505
You guy

22:28.646 --> 22:30.477
You must be more careful, James.

22:30.581 --> 22:33.675
The police can put you in jail

22:33.784 --> 22:37.015
Honestly, I'm looking for something.

22:37.121 --> 22:40.249
I accidentally fell, I do not know.

22:40.691 --> 22:42.158
They are too big to make a big noise

22:42.259 --> 22:45.786
I'm just looking for something.
Soda, soap, magazine or something.

22:45.896 --> 22:48.194
Yes, you are looking for something, that's right.

22:48.299 --> 22:49.994
Finding things that are all over the floor

22:50.101 --> 22:52.865
Seriously, you can not do that.

22:52.970 --> 22:55.336
Did the aspirin bottle get rid of me?

22:56.340 --> 22:57.830
Or am I lost?

22:58.943 --> 23:02.106
And my sunglasses?
Oh, this is mine.

23:05.750 --> 23:09.777
I just got to point A, has point B, so...

23:09.887 --> 23:12.082
I do not know how to get to point C.

23:12.189 --> 23:15.124
James, are you still in the mood to make a joke?

23:16.794 --> 23:19.319
Come on, I'll take you home.

23:22.133 --> 23:24.226
Okay, sit down slowly.

23:25.102 --> 23:26.831
You're home, okay?

23:26.937 --> 23:28.564
You're home, come in.

23:28.672 --> 23:30.196
What happened?

23:30.307 --> 23:31.797
What the hell is happening?
Hey, Delmar

23:31.909 --> 23:33.137
- How are you doing?
- Catherine.

23:33.244 --> 23:34.541
God - Where did you find Him?

23:34.645 --> 23:36.340
- pharmacy - what?

23:36.447 --> 23:38.574
I've always been careful

23:38.682 --> 23:41.150
I'm trying to buy something, you know.

23:41.252 --> 23:44.016
Suddenly, there was a commotion in the store.

23:44.121 --> 23:47.648
Of course, I went and explored

23:47.758 --> 23:50.852
Then I saw this guy.

23:50.961 --> 23:54.260
Do things all over the floor

23:54.365 --> 23:55.525
- because?
I do not know.

23:55.633 --> 23:56.964
Delmar, you do not need to get so ruined.

23:57.067 --> 23:59.262
Of course he has to explain clearly, James, quiet.

23:59.370 --> 24:03.830
- You are quiet.
"James, my God, James.

24:04.275 --> 24:07.642
"You have to be more careful."
- I have that.

24:07.745 --> 24:11.738
Ok I just went into the store to find something.

24:11.849 --> 24:15.910
"Then I lost."
"Yes, you are lost, very well.

24:16.020 --> 24:18.045
The pharmacy has never been so confusing.

24:18.155 --> 24:19.747
"Really."

24:19.857 --> 24:21.688
I'm flying forward.

24:21.792 --> 24:25.489
Thunder can not help saving it.

24:25.596 --> 24:28.030
So, how did you do it?

24:28.132 --> 24:32.068
This is the case, I said I'm your aunt

24:32.169 --> 24:36.003
I do my best to keep you from the store.

24:36.106 --> 24:37.539
I do not know why she's an aunt.

24:37.641 --> 24:39.541
It does not matter, it does not matter anyway.

24:39.643 --> 24:42.840
I have your help, thank you.

24:45.950 --> 24:50.148
I suggest you do not stay near the pharmacy for now.

24:50.254 --> 24:52.017
Otherwise, the police officer will find you here.

24:52.122 --> 24:54.022
"I will not be surprised.
- Police?

24:54.124 --> 24:57.025
Yes, Mr. Sanik, he is very angry.

24:58.262 --> 25:00.526
Did your sunglasses pay for it?

25:02.166 --> 25:03.861
- Really - James

25:03.968 --> 25:06.937
You know, it's all that damn novel.

25:07.037 --> 25:09.005
- what?
- it is not? Catherine

25:09.106 --> 25:10.937
All because of the damn soap

25:11.041 --> 25:11.939
James

25:12.042 --> 25:14.476
When did you go to the store to buy soap?

25:14.578 --> 25:15.806
- No - That's...

25:16.413 --> 25:18.176
He's not talking about a piece of soap.

25:18.282 --> 25:20.216
He is referring to novel

25:21.719 --> 25:25.485
Do not blame me for being rude, Delmar

25:25.589 --> 25:27.420
You do not even know what you're talking about.

25:27.858 --> 25:33.228
- I stopped, I stopped - James,
do not speak loudly with Delmar.

25:33.330 --> 25:34.661
I'm not getting fired.

25:34.765 --> 25:36.858
But I do not want to talk now, can I?

25:36.967 --> 25:38.366
I do not want to talk about soap.

25:38.469 --> 25:40.528
- old age - a year ago

25:40.638 --> 25:42.230
A year ago things were old.

25:42.339 --> 25:43.363
That's right.

25:44.041 --> 25:47.010
Whether you are fired or not, this is not a key point.

25:47.111 --> 25:49.409
You are a great actor

25:50.414 --> 25:55.351
Among these crazy
plots Enjoy the magic

25:55.452 --> 25:57.647
- Your performance is not really covered.
"That's right.

25:57.755 --> 25:59.017
In between

25:59.623 --> 26:01.614
What?

26:01.725 --> 26:05.126
You said that word.
He likes that word.

26:05.229 --> 26:07.060
I said that? Does he like this?

26:07.164 --> 26:07.994
What he likes?

26:08.098 --> 26:09.895
Between that word?
- Yes.

26:10.000 --> 26:10.989
No

26:11.101 --> 26:12.591
I do not like that word.

26:12.703 --> 26:15.695
I just found out that people like
to say 'Cause no one said that

26:15.806 --> 26:16.830
OK

26:16.941 --> 26:18.238
At least they do not usually say that word

26:19.276 --> 26:22.507
As I just said, your performance is great.

26:22.613 --> 26:23.409
That's right.

26:23.514 --> 26:25.675
You left the day when I was limp.

26:25.783 --> 26:27.410
- Watching, after 40 years
- I watched, after 40 years

26:27.518 --> 26:29.042
I know...

26:29.153 --> 26:30.882
"I've heard you speaking hundreds of times.
James

26:33.123 --> 26:35.819
I'm still grateful to you, Delmar.

26:35.926 --> 26:38.986
But I still do not want to talk about it, can I?

26:39.096 --> 26:40.563
I will not act again.

26:41.298 --> 26:43.357
I'm writing a book? I'm a writer

26:43.467 --> 26:45.401
Right

26:45.502 --> 26:47.800
I'm tired, okay?
- OK

26:47.905 --> 26:49.338
I'm like this because I'm tired.

26:49.440 --> 26:50.668
OK

26:51.542 --> 26:54.511
But really, James, they should not let you go.

26:56.413 --> 26:58.881
I swear I'll never look at the novel again.

26:58.983 --> 27:01.281
What good looks are there without your game?

27:01.385 --> 27:03.250
It's very good

27:09.860 --> 27:12.886
The boss crushed everything on the floor.

27:16.767 --> 27:18.632
The crowd dissipated

27:18.736 --> 27:19.998
Dissipate?

27:23.340 --> 27:26.070
The crowd left

27:26.176 --> 27:27.871
Who are you calling? James

27:30.214 --> 27:31.442
Did not call anyone.

27:32.750 --> 27:35.082
Who's he talking to?

27:49.667 --> 27:53.763
Symmetry

27:54.238 --> 27:55.967
I do not know if it's so real.

27:59.309 --> 28:01.209
I thought it would be worse.

28:02.846 --> 28:05.713
In my life, my life.

28:05.816 --> 28:07.215
Never was...

28:08.018 --> 28:11.385
Such humiliation

28:49.793 --> 28:53.058
This is the thing you do not want to say.

28:54.431 --> 28:56.023
And now I'm constantly squatting

29:22.860 --> 29:24.327
What happened? James

29:25.496 --> 29:27.327
Like tonight?

29:29.967 --> 29:32.367
- Can you hear? James
- Sure I Can Hear

29:40.110 --> 29:41.873
I think this seems to be broken.

29:42.479 --> 29:44.379
The phone is not bad, James.

29:45.249 --> 29:47.547
Try to focus on it and focus on your work.

29:57.060 --> 29:59.494
All I can do is listen.

29:59.596 --> 30:03.032
Do not feel so slow, do not be so slow

30:04.067 --> 30:05.466
I want to write.

30:56.286 --> 30:57.480
Never enough

30:59.022 --> 31:01.957
It's really impressive, this weapon...

31:02.059 --> 31:05.324
No witness testimony This
is really scaring me.

31:05.429 --> 31:07.226
Yes, that's not exactly my choice.

31:07.331 --> 31:10.698
Scared me, if I try?

31:18.442 --> 31:20.706
Hey, Jason, I got to see you again.

31:21.245 --> 31:23.110
I will contact him at the time and place.

31:23.213 --> 31:26.444
One person, without weapons, without support

31:26.550 --> 31:31.886
They can come closer I'll be
a little bit farther away.

31:32.856 --> 31:34.346
That's how I handle things.

31:37.661 --> 31:39.219
Too late

31:41.064 --> 31:42.463
Look, my girlfriend is so troublesome.

31:42.566 --> 31:45.126
Resist me, you know what I'm thinking?

31:45.869 --> 31:49.430
I think we can get along.

31:58.081 --> 31:59.309
I do not know who you are.

31:59.883 --> 32:01.817
I do not know you at all.

32:02.653 --> 32:03.483
Who are you

32:03.587 --> 32:06.078
"At point A, you're somebody.
- I do not know you.

32:13.931 --> 32:16.729
"Listen, do not tell vampires.
"At point B, you're somebody else.

32:16.833 --> 32:18.425
This is getting on well with me...

32:18.535 --> 32:20.366
- The oldest person
ever - at point C

32:20.470 --> 32:21.732
Vampire

32:22.439 --> 32:28.378
Another level, angle, fragment, field, area

32:33.317 --> 32:34.511
James?

32:46.363 --> 32:49.730
James?
(I.e.

32:50.334 --> 32:51.858
What happened? Are you alright?

32:54.304 --> 32:55.794
God.

33:00.811 --> 33:03.609
"Is it enough to pull
today?" James - right

33:03.714 --> 33:07.309
Dressed like a man, Catherine

33:08.118 --> 33:11.212
I know it's her, but it's a bit confusing.

33:11.321 --> 33:15.314
Let me help you with your hair, okay?
I'll help you comb your hair.

33:17.394 --> 33:20.192
Why do you look so worried?

33:20.297 --> 33:21.787
It's me.

33:21.898 --> 33:26.358
Quick, James, ask her.
You know it's Catherine.

33:26.470 --> 33:28.529
It's hidden somewhere in there, right?

33:30.540 --> 33:32.132
Must be com...

33:32.242 --> 33:35.336
- It does not matter -
related to your ear

33:36.146 --> 33:37.443
My ears?

33:38.849 --> 33:40.248
Which ear?

33:40.350 --> 33:43.217
- your right ear -
your right ear?

33:44.554 --> 33:45.748
What happened to my right ear?

33:45.856 --> 33:48.324
I do not know, but it caught my interest.

33:48.425 --> 33:49.653
When it started?

33:49.760 --> 33:52.320
For a while but I do not want to tell you

33:52.429 --> 33:53.919
- Do you know...
James

33:54.031 --> 33:56.295
"It's too long today."
"It is not her ears that confuse you.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.868
You must know how my ears are not

33:58.969 --> 34:00.596
Not her ear.

34:00.704 --> 34:03.002
Okay, you have the final say.

34:03.106 --> 34:05.301
Your ears are nothing, James.

34:10.347 --> 34:12.871
Come and feel

34:13.417 --> 34:18.013
Feel this ear, right ear, James

34:18.722 --> 34:20.087
Left ear

34:20.991 --> 34:22.150
The same

34:23.460 --> 34:24.791
Symmetry

34:26.530 --> 34:27.996
Hey look

34:28.864 --> 34:32.027
Wait a minute, hello?

34:32.936 --> 34:34.027
Hello

34:35.438 --> 34:38.704
Look, I hear the phone with my ears.
No problem

34:40.110 --> 34:41.270
Yes

34:42.344 --> 34:43.777
Please wait a moment.

34:45.081 --> 34:46.481
I want to meet you.

34:49.619 --> 34:50.677
Good

34:54.891 --> 34:57.553
I'll be back soon, listen.

36:15.172 --> 36:19.836
Something that does not exist
somewhere Later it existed again

36:32.923 --> 36:33.855
Early

36:33.957 --> 36:35.219
(I.e.
- How are you doing?

36:36.693 --> 36:39.560
What do you think?
I'm busy with these.

36:39.663 --> 36:43.224
Quick, I've been doing this all night.

36:47.137 --> 36:48.126
Good Morning

36:50.040 --> 36:51.735
Can you go to other smoking rooms?

36:53.476 --> 36:54.738
You can

36:54.844 --> 36:56.334
When did you start pumping?

36:57.113 --> 36:58.444
Occasionally

36:59.015 --> 37:02.542
This is not the answer. When did I ask you to start?

37:02.652 --> 37:05.780
I'm not asking how often do you get it?

37:05.889 --> 37:07.857
I just smoked in other rooms.

37:13.964 --> 37:15.454
OK forget it.

37:15.565 --> 37:18.261
Do you like it? These are...

37:18.368 --> 37:21.804
These are psychiatrists in
the 50's Inkblot test drawn

37:21.905 --> 37:24.100
I think these pictures are very good.

37:24.207 --> 37:25.834
- It is?
Yes.

37:25.942 --> 37:27.068
Thank you

37:27.177 --> 37:30.908
You know, I always thought

37:30.981 --> 37:33.779
And I have an idea to tell you

37:33.883 --> 37:35.111
Really

37:35.685 --> 37:39.177
Think, think about this photo, you have an idea.

37:39.289 --> 37:43.783
I'm thinking, hey, about my book.

37:43.893 --> 37:45.986
- So what?
"You know about my job.

37:46.096 --> 37:49.725
How much effort was paid

37:49.833 --> 37:52.358
How much time was invested?

37:53.036 --> 37:55.527
Three hours there, eight hours there.

37:55.639 --> 37:57.800
Ten o'clock here, you know, it's crazy.

37:57.907 --> 37:59.807
- Right. It's crazy.

37:59.909 --> 38:01.433
Yes.
- then...

38:02.379 --> 38:07.146
If I put my text and your painting...

38:10.620 --> 38:14.522
It's art, right? Not only...

38:14.624 --> 38:19.027
My work plus your
work All this is art

38:19.129 --> 38:24.226
Art, art, all fictitious

38:24.334 --> 38:26.131
All of nothing

38:26.236 --> 38:28.568
You know I mean, fictitious

38:29.205 --> 38:34.006
So... it's there.

38:34.744 --> 38:37.144
Really like

38:38.048 --> 38:40.016
- Nothing, nothing

38:42.519 --> 38:45.750
Yes, yes, I mean that.

38:45.855 --> 38:51.851
Because it's like something that does not exist somewhere.

38:51.961 --> 38:54.486
Later there was again The main
character of the white whale

38:55.031 --> 39:00.025
One day, many days, there were no white whales at the time.

39:00.537 --> 39:05.099
Without white whales, then scream

39:05.208 --> 39:07.438
The white whale appeared Yes.

39:07.544 --> 39:10.206
There is and will always be

39:10.313 --> 39:14.807
But one day the white whale disappeared suddenly.

39:14.918 --> 39:17.580
Yes, but you just mentioned

39:17.687 --> 39:24.058
Equivalent to a Heavy Load, James

39:27.297 --> 39:29.458
Do not we have a picture like that?

39:29.566 --> 39:32.000
Is there such a painting in your house?

39:32.736 --> 39:34.203
Yes, similar

39:38.508 --> 39:39.873
Great

39:42.312 --> 39:46.373
This requires an artist
Created by the artist

39:46.483 --> 39:49.316
Yes.
- Everything needs to be created

39:50.019 --> 39:52.180
You need to trust someone's hands.

39:53.089 --> 39:55.023
We've known each other a long time, right?

39:55.125 --> 39:57.685
- Right - We are very
familiar with each other

39:57.794 --> 40:01.321
Know each other's creations, trust each other

40:01.431 --> 40:02.591
Yes

40:02.699 --> 40:04.530
- It is?
- Yes

40:04.634 --> 40:08.400
Okay, what if I'm dead?

40:09.639 --> 40:11.630
- what?
"I'm not saying that kind of death.

40:11.741 --> 40:14.005
I just said, in case, I'm dead.

40:14.110 --> 40:16.704
What if I get out and pressed down the tree?

40:16.813 --> 40:18.474
Or was it hit by a car?

40:18.581 --> 40:22.745
I left the world, but the work is not over yet.

40:22.852 --> 40:24.752
I mean, things are still there.

40:24.854 --> 40:28.688
Completed 75%

40:28.792 --> 40:35.197
Or 80% or 70%

40:35.298 --> 40:37.528
Just put there

40:37.634 --> 40:40.398
No one will finish more, it is a semi-finished product.

40:40.503 --> 40:43.028
- 70% completed - Completed 70%

40:43.139 --> 40:45.539
You are crazy?

40:45.642 --> 40:47.200
No

40:47.310 --> 40:49.574
Hi everybody, where did the people go?

40:49.679 --> 40:50.737
James

40:50.847 --> 40:52.678
We're here, hey, Delmar

40:52.782 --> 40:55.376
Good morning, the bell does not ring.

40:55.485 --> 40:56.417
excuse me

40:56.519 --> 40:58.851
Not so asked, but...

40:58.955 --> 41:00.946
Can you lend me some sugar? I'm baking bread

41:01.057 --> 41:02.081
- Catherine - Of course...

41:02.192 --> 41:04.456
- What is it?
"Is not the work over yet?"

41:04.561 --> 41:05.858
- Ok - So, when I
go back west...

41:05.962 --> 41:08.829
You should do this first.

41:08.932 --> 41:11.127
Okay. This is what I want to tell you.

41:11.234 --> 41:13.464
Back to the West?

41:13.570 --> 41:15.060
- my God.
- Then...

41:16.873 --> 41:18.363
I'm so glad you're here, Delmar.

41:18.475 --> 41:19.499
Please, sit down.

41:19.843 --> 41:22.505
We are discussing something very important.

41:23.079 --> 41:26.810
I suggest Catherine make an appointment with me.

41:28.585 --> 41:30.883
Oh, that's...

41:30.987 --> 41:34.184
- A secret agreement - No,
this is not a secret.

41:34.290 --> 41:39.227
It's a simple arrangement.
Then I'm back in the West.

41:39.329 --> 41:41.889
I hope you have finished my book.

41:42.532 --> 41:47.196
If you die first, I'll help you complete the paintings and sculptures.

41:52.075 --> 41:55.738
"Okay, James, are you really talking?"
- Of course

41:55.845 --> 41:58.609
"Have you heard of this agreement?"
I will meet

41:58.715 --> 42:00.649
Just for safety

42:00.750 --> 42:04.277
Know that after evaporating

42:04.387 --> 42:09.120
The work can still be completed
It will make me feel better

42:09.225 --> 42:11.318
This is really interesting.

42:11.427 --> 42:14.828
- Thank you, Delmar.
- It's all right.

42:14.931 --> 42:16.626
So, how do we sign up?

42:17.233 --> 42:19.599
Are you... going to leave a message for me?

42:19.702 --> 42:22.728
Do you want the book to be published?

42:23.540 --> 42:25.940
Which of the author's photos should I put?

42:26.843 --> 42:29.107
The details are pretty

42:29.212 --> 42:32.375
It's really very

42:32.482 --> 42:34.507
In fact, it's not that complicated.

42:34.617 --> 42:36.642
- I'll be at work...
- very good

42:36.753 --> 42:38.721
Leave some words, okay?

42:38.821 --> 42:42.382
As for the author's photo, it's no big deal.

42:42.492 --> 42:44.119
I mean...

42:47.597 --> 42:49.428
I still use your pictures, I do not care.

42:49.532 --> 42:53.593
I do not even think about it, my picture.

42:53.703 --> 42:54.897
I think about it.

42:55.004 --> 42:56.301
What should I do?

42:56.406 --> 42:57.930
Should I put my hair up?

42:58.041 --> 43:03.638
Still down?
I should have been sitting in danger...

43:03.746 --> 43:04.940
Or if you have nothing to sit on?

43:05.048 --> 43:09.280
The author's photo is not the essence of the job, okay?

43:09.385 --> 43:11.945
"It's not the kind of agreement you want.
OK.

43:12.055 --> 43:13.716
- not related to the author's photo
- Catherine

43:13.823 --> 43:15.120
As?
If i am you

43:15.224 --> 43:18.523
I'm going to comb my hair to the side.

43:20.930 --> 43:22.761
Yes, yes, that would be...

43:22.865 --> 43:25.356
So you can be in your ear...

43:25.468 --> 43:29.131
Connect a flower and wear a headscarf

43:29.238 --> 43:32.639
- The handkerchief looks beautiful.
- The two suggestions are great

43:32.742 --> 43:36.508
Do not worry, just point it, okay?

43:36.613 --> 43:37.739
OK

43:39.215 --> 43:40.147
OK

43:40.249 --> 43:43.946
This project is incredible, but James.

43:44.053 --> 43:45.213
You really think too much.

43:45.321 --> 43:47.380
A rich and healthy life is waiting for you ahead.

43:47.490 --> 43:48.855
- Catherine - What is this?

43:48.958 --> 43:53.054
If I were you, I'd take a picture like that.

43:57.500 --> 43:58.432
OK

43:58.534 --> 43:59.933
Patricia?

44:00.036 --> 44:01.936
It does not matter which author photo

44:03.806 --> 44:05.433
You know, your face.

44:05.541 --> 44:09.637
No matter what angle is a good photo

44:09.746 --> 44:12.306
After all, you're an actor, James.

44:12.415 --> 44:14.315
I used to be an actor.

44:14.817 --> 44:18.685
I'm not an actor anymore.
I am now a writer, Delmar.

44:18.788 --> 44:20.949
- I do not act, I write an article.
- OK

44:21.858 --> 44:24.190
"Take this, Delma.
- OK

44:24.293 --> 44:26.090
I think I should get out.

44:26.195 --> 44:28.163
I just got in and got some sugar.

44:28.264 --> 44:29.697
"I have the sugar I want."
- Take it.

44:29.799 --> 44:30.458
Thank you, Catherine.

44:30.566 --> 44:32.796
You are welcome to come and sit at any time.

44:32.902 --> 44:34.199
Thank you

44:34.804 --> 44:36.863
Goodbye, you beautiful student.

44:38.574 --> 44:40.633
Thank you.
- toasted bread gently

44:40.743 --> 44:42.005
Hey, Delmar

44:42.111 --> 44:43.738
- You can bake and pick it up again.
James

44:44.480 --> 44:47.278
I have absolute confidence in you.

44:47.383 --> 44:48.748
You can complete your own novel

44:48.851 --> 44:49.783
So?

44:49.886 --> 44:53.287
You know This deal can be beneficial to me.

44:53.389 --> 44:57.291
Although I have not drawn up any plans to die

44:57.393 --> 45:00.920
However, you can definitely interpret an image

45:02.331 --> 45:06.995
For example, look at this photo and tell me

45:07.103 --> 45:09.503
What do you see

45:12.108 --> 45:14.440
Is it a wall and a floor?

45:14.544 --> 45:16.512
It's the wall and the floor.

45:16.612 --> 45:21.208
I actually thought so when I was drawing last night.

45:21.317 --> 45:22.841
Very observant

45:22.952 --> 45:25.216
What I saw was the ink on the paper.

45:26.089 --> 45:27.716
You have to admire her.

45:27.824 --> 45:29.815
This is the ink on the paper.

45:31.427 --> 45:32.655
Very good, Patricia

45:33.429 --> 45:35.260
Hey, how about taking a ride?

45:35.364 --> 45:36.456
Get out of this room?

45:36.566 --> 45:37.999
Okay, I want to go.

45:38.101 --> 45:39.966
"Patricia, what about you?"
- do not do

45:41.704 --> 45:42.693
Only you

47:44.227 --> 47:45.558
I'll find Delmar.

47:57.139 --> 47:58.367
Delmar

47:58.474 --> 48:03.639
I'm coming to you to go to our house to eat apple pie.

48:03.746 --> 48:05.873
Come in, James, come in quickly.

48:05.982 --> 48:07.040
Log in

48:10.152 --> 48:11.176
Patricia

48:15.658 --> 48:16.750
God

48:18.794 --> 48:20.625
- How are you doing?
- Not bad

48:20.730 --> 48:21.628
What are you doing?

48:21.731 --> 48:25.428
I'm going to a soap opera that's broadcasting you.

48:25.968 --> 48:28.061
No, I'm not watching.

48:28.170 --> 48:30.263
I mean, since you left

48:30.373 --> 48:31.772
"I do not watch anymore.
- Does not matter

48:31.874 --> 48:33.307
Anything

48:33.409 --> 48:35.343
You should...
You can watch

48:35.444 --> 48:36.502
Hey, you should watch

48:36.612 --> 48:38.637
I mean, this is a good show.

48:38.748 --> 48:41.080
Even without my participation

48:42.451 --> 48:43.816
Does not matter

49:11.814 --> 49:14.715
Is that a replay? It seems to be a long time ago

49:14.817 --> 49:19.880
This station is often broadcast in the middle of the night.

49:19.989 --> 49:23.220
And often not in order

49:23.326 --> 49:24.987
If you are not the number one fan

49:25.094 --> 49:28.291
I do not understand what the show is doing.

49:30.232 --> 49:31.927
There is no reason for this.

49:33.302 --> 49:36.237
This is a novel, it is telling stories.

49:36.339 --> 49:38.330
- Why do you still want...
I know

49:38.441 --> 49:39.931
- Look at the old one?
I know

49:45.281 --> 49:48.307
I've seen every episode before you get fired.

49:48.417 --> 49:49.975
Leave, I quit.

49:50.086 --> 49:51.075
Yes, that's what I mean.

49:51.187 --> 49:55.715
At that time, you quit the game.

49:55.825 --> 49:57.292
That's right.

50:01.330 --> 50:05.232
Hey, you want to... eat some apple pies?

50:05.334 --> 50:08.201
Catherine just shopped with me.

50:08.304 --> 50:11.535
I'm going to be a party and I want to invite you into the past.

50:11.640 --> 50:13.767
That's great.
- OK

50:13.876 --> 50:16.936
Okay, let me get you a shawl.

50:17.046 --> 50:20.345
Just next

50:25.621 --> 50:27.282
I killed a man in Tribeca.

50:28.491 --> 50:29.753
Watching him die

50:33.195 --> 50:35.356
I do not have a bad feeling.

50:36.832 --> 50:38.766
I turned into art

50:39.969 --> 50:40.703
Never stopped

50:40.703 --> 50:41.470
People do not understand how sensitive others are.
Never stopped

50:41.470 --> 50:43.072
People do not understand how sensitive others are.

50:43.072 --> 50:45.775
People do not understand how sensitive others are.
Yeah, I got home last night.

50:45.775 --> 50:49.176
Enter the restaurant and open the chandelier.

50:50.246 --> 50:52.714
There's a picture of my inkblot on the wall.

50:52.815 --> 50:54.612
She is scrawled up

50:54.717 --> 50:57.083
- what?
- Is so

50:57.186 --> 51:00.986
She has a meaningless doodle.

51:01.090 --> 51:03.183
And this is a photo that I really like.

51:03.292 --> 51:05.453
I originally wanted to get him.
Was ruined by her

51:24.947 --> 51:27.006
You know, I've been...

51:27.116 --> 51:31.644
Use a new stationery in the study

51:31.754 --> 51:32.982
For my writing

51:33.089 --> 51:34.488
It is? What is it?

51:34.590 --> 51:36.956
Do you know how much I love using ink pens?

51:37.059 --> 51:39.892
Three cups of coffee, thank you.

51:39.995 --> 51:40.893
I know

51:40.996 --> 51:42.759
Signature pen and microphone pen

51:42.865 --> 51:44.628
Uh

51:44.733 --> 51:50.365
I started... using... pencils

51:50.473 --> 51:51.872
You do not hate pencils.

51:51.974 --> 51:53.339
Yes I know

51:53.442 --> 51:55.376
I still have an ink pen in use.

51:55.478 --> 52:00.438
But the pencil can do this without the ink pen.

52:00.549 --> 52:02.744
First of all, your ink will not run out

52:03.786 --> 52:08.246
Secondly, your punches are very good.

52:08.357 --> 52:14.023
The pencil is so interesting that I tried to use it.

52:14.563 --> 52:18.363
"You know, physical
effort." "That's right.

52:18.467 --> 52:21.402
You can feel the touch

52:21.804 --> 52:24.830
I really feel that work efficiency has improved.

52:24.940 --> 52:31.675
Real work, have fun and...

52:31.780 --> 52:36.649
Better yet, if you made a mistake

52:36.752 --> 52:40.916
Can be canceled with a rubber

52:41.023 --> 52:46.689
The only remaining crumbs of rubber

52:46.795 --> 52:48.786
"Strange things happened.
"I do not know what it would be like.

52:48.898 --> 52:51.264
While it explodes, it's gone.

52:51.367 --> 52:55.770
So the whole piece of paper is brand new.

52:55.871 --> 52:57.532
"You can start from scratch
too." "That's right.

52:57.640 --> 52:59.301
So the pencil is really god.

52:59.408 --> 53:02.673
Curiously

53:02.778 --> 53:04.803
Yes, efficiency artifact

53:05.881 --> 53:10.011
Right? I really do not understand why you...

53:10.119 --> 53:13.282
I always love simplifying, James

53:13.389 --> 53:15.448
Why do not you use an ink pen?

53:16.358 --> 53:20.021
Have you passed? Just use an ink pen

53:20.129 --> 53:21.357
Right

53:23.332 --> 53:24.629
- Right James?

53:25.568 --> 53:28.935
I'll continue to use the ink pen.
I went to the bathroom.

53:33.676 --> 53:35.769
Why do you scrawl my paintings?

53:35.878 --> 53:37.539
I like it.
- What do you like?

53:37.613 --> 53:41.140
Do you like my painting or do you like to destroy it?

53:41.250 --> 53:45.084
I did not hurt, I was painting.
I added the painting

53:46.322 --> 53:49.519
If you are so interested in art

53:49.625 --> 53:53.584
Glad to provide you with ink and paper.

53:53.696 --> 53:57.291
How do you want to practice?

53:57.399 --> 54:01.665
But you should not practice on other people's paintings.

54:01.770 --> 54:03.897
Whether you know it or not

54:04.006 --> 54:05.564
Your behavior is really provocative.

54:11.380 --> 54:12.870
I just told Patricia.

54:12.982 --> 54:15.177
She should not destroy my paintings

54:16.952 --> 54:22.049
I will not say that she is "doing destruction"

54:22.157 --> 54:23.146
Are not you going to tell?

54:23.259 --> 54:24.988
What do you say? This is my job

54:25.094 --> 54:27.858
If it spoils your article

54:27.963 --> 54:31.364
You'll be furious, James.

54:31.467 --> 54:34.061
I know, I'm not breastfeeding her.

54:34.169 --> 54:37.536
I just said...

54:38.474 --> 54:41.568
Patricia is like this

54:43.979 --> 54:49.246
What you spoil is a painting that I like very much.

54:55.724 --> 55:01.754
Hey, you just said you're using a new piece of paper.

55:01.864 --> 55:03.263
- a new design role -
No, I did not say that.

55:03.365 --> 55:05.390
I said I'm using a different color of paper.

55:05.501 --> 55:06.160
(I.e.

55:06.268 --> 55:08.793
Just a different color of paper

55:08.904 --> 55:12.396
It's a creamy tone

55:12.508 --> 55:13.770
- grayish Yes.

55:13.876 --> 55:15.901
I'm also starting to draw the character

55:16.011 --> 55:19.777
Better than standing up You
can not find it at all.

55:22.251 --> 55:26.051
Ah, that's the way it is.

55:26.155 --> 55:29.682
I was thinking... maybe you did not draw well.

55:30.392 --> 55:35.329
Because it seems... a
little Not very positive

55:37.900 --> 55:39.595
My character is not correct?

55:49.078 --> 55:51.012
Oh my God

55:57.019 --> 55:58.816
Do you know Catherine?

55:58.921 --> 56:05.121
Sometimes you dress like a man.

56:06.462 --> 56:09.124
I'm confused. I know, James.

56:09.231 --> 56:13.793
I know sometimes you'll be confused about what's in front of you.

56:13.902 --> 56:15.369
But it's me

56:15.938 --> 56:18.998
Whenever I see you dressed as a man
You will feel very much like costumes

56:19.108 --> 56:23.442
- It looks very pretentious.
- Is that it?

56:24.113 --> 56:27.514
Looks like a fantasy, very fake

56:27.616 --> 56:30.380
The garrison does not apply here, Patricia

56:30.486 --> 56:31.510
- You are here...
- you should not use that word

56:31.620 --> 56:33.053
Patricia, how do you say that?

56:33.155 --> 56:37.057
I do not know, I'm just Not
yet accustomed to her dress

56:39.228 --> 56:44.928
So whenever I wear this dress
Do you think I'm such a clown?

56:45.033 --> 56:48.400
Did you think so in your heart?

56:48.504 --> 56:50.768
You seem to be wearing a costume.

56:55.110 --> 56:58.307
Okay, God.

56:58.414 --> 57:01.713
It's really a lot of speculation tonight, right?

57:02.951 --> 57:06.512
Honestly, this is really hurting feelings.

57:07.790 --> 57:12.386
Patricia, I do my best to take care of your brother.

57:12.494 --> 57:16.328
Taking care of him because he cares for him

57:16.432 --> 57:18.832
I have to try my best to care about you.

57:18.934 --> 57:22.097
"I have to take care of you."
Catherine

57:22.204 --> 57:27.164
I'll do it because I care about your brother.
My good friend

57:27.276 --> 57:32.737
And when you sit here, it makes me feel uncomfortable.

57:32.848 --> 57:36.784
I mean, if I want to leave home

57:36.885 --> 57:42.323
Dress like a half-tone man with a beard

57:42.424 --> 57:44.187
I have a good performance

57:44.293 --> 57:47.160
These are not difficult, I can do that.

57:47.262 --> 57:50.857
But the person who questioned me is actually...

57:50.966 --> 57:55.096
It's too much for you to live with me under one roof.

57:55.204 --> 57:56.569
- It's hurting a lot.
Catherine

57:56.672 --> 57:58.970
It's all because of your mental illness, I mean...

57:59.074 --> 58:02.737
If you have a mental illness, you will forget.

58:02.845 --> 58:07.839
Acceptable, at least true
And what is my calculation?

58:07.950 --> 58:12.853
I'm pretentious, but a clown.

58:12.955 --> 58:14.650
It's simply a buzzword.

58:14.756 --> 58:16.348
I do not know what I'm talking about.

58:16.458 --> 58:18.824
I am not mentally ill, there is no such thing.

58:18.927 --> 58:22.988
I'm just a person who wants to dress like a man.

58:23.098 --> 58:24.292
It is

58:30.339 --> 58:31.636
excuse me

58:31.740 --> 58:33.571
As?
- That's... Mr.

58:33.675 --> 58:35.939
Can you turn down the volume?
You scared my baby.

58:36.044 --> 58:39.070
Your baby is also scared.
You should be whispering.

58:40.415 --> 58:44.442
This is a place for family gatherings.

58:44.553 --> 58:48.922
There is a group of perverted places to expose each other

58:49.024 --> 58:51.424
I'll give you a suggestion, sir, sit down.

58:55.864 --> 59:00.096
Really disgusting, transsexual

59:41.910 --> 59:44.674
Do not let your tears fall

01:00:07.202 --> 01:00:10.501
I have an old neighbor

01:00:11.506 --> 01:00:15.738
He is always a woman at age 65.

01:00:15.844 --> 01:00:20.679
He has long gray hair
Wearing strange glasses

01:00:20.782 --> 01:00:24.149
I always love wearing a skirt, stepping on high heels

01:00:25.253 --> 01:00:29.155
But he's obviously a man, obviously

01:00:29.925 --> 01:00:31.415
Do you remember our neighbor? Patricia

01:00:31.526 --> 01:00:33.050
- That man?
- remember if

01:00:33.161 --> 01:00:35.425
What are you doing now? James

01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:39.227
I do not know, I just remembered him coming.

01:00:39.334 --> 01:00:43.532
Our neighbor is very strong

01:00:44.139 --> 01:00:47.597
This old man in disguise

01:00:48.243 --> 01:00:50.677
I mean, let go.

01:00:50.779 --> 01:00:54.510
He's ready to fight for a long time.

01:00:54.616 --> 01:01:01.454
I used to think he should be...

01:01:01.556 --> 01:01:05.287
The strongest and most powerful person in the world

01:01:05.394 --> 01:01:07.624
Very strong, got it?

01:01:07.729 --> 01:01:10.664
Dressed like a woman in a community like that at the time

01:01:10.766 --> 01:01:13.667
What is needed is unparalleled determination and perseverance

01:01:13.769 --> 01:01:18.001
I used to track him.

01:01:18.106 --> 01:01:20.836
Just watching him

01:01:20.942 --> 01:01:23.843
People see the reaction of their walk

01:01:27.716 --> 01:01:32.050
I'm sorry to ruin your paintings, Catherine.

01:01:35.891 --> 01:01:37.984
Her neighbor, the "woman"

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.825
Have you talked to him yet? James

01:01:42.397 --> 01:01:44.024
No, I hope to have

01:01:45.167 --> 01:01:47.635
Only people are very sensitive

01:01:47.736 --> 01:01:49.067
You know, people do not understand.

01:01:49.171 --> 01:01:52.698
Others do not understand how sensitive people are.

01:01:52.808 --> 01:01:53.672
They just do not understand

01:01:53.775 --> 01:01:55.970
So I have to be arrogant to others.

01:01:56.078 --> 01:01:57.204
Who are you talking about?

01:01:57.312 --> 01:01:59.803
Anyone can

01:02:09.591 --> 01:02:10.615
get up

01:02:12.627 --> 01:02:18.497
Let's go home.
Come on, James.

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:19.999
Come on, Patricia.

01:02:33.014 --> 01:02:37.041
After all, you have experienced your own life.

01:02:50.198 --> 01:02:51.358
(I.e.

01:02:51.466 --> 01:02:52.433
Hello Delmar

01:02:52.534 --> 01:02:54.331
- What are you doing?
Anything.

01:02:54.436 --> 01:02:57.928
I just want to come and say hello.

01:02:58.039 --> 01:03:00.337
A person feels a little alone at home, you know

01:03:00.442 --> 01:03:01.704
Right

01:03:04.813 --> 01:03:06.144
What are you busy with? James

01:03:06.248 --> 01:03:09.308
"Are you writing your book?"
Yes.

01:03:09.417 --> 01:03:11.510
Hey, you're very talented.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.982
When can I read your masterpiece?

01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:19.652
To be honest, I'm fed up with fear.

01:03:20.128 --> 01:03:21.356
I look forward to nothing more than a book...

01:03:21.463 --> 01:03:23.931
Autographed printed book only

01:03:24.933 --> 01:03:26.332
The first will be left for you.

01:03:28.737 --> 01:03:31.262
Do you mind if I sit next to you?

01:03:31.373 --> 01:03:32.806
With you?

01:03:33.875 --> 01:03:36.469
"Do not worry, please, sit down.
- very good

01:03:37.245 --> 01:03:38.269
Very good

01:03:40.115 --> 01:03:43.243
I have a crossword puzzle to come

01:03:43.351 --> 01:03:45.876
I always carry this with me.

01:03:45.987 --> 01:03:48.820
Who knows when inspiration will appear

01:04:08.877 --> 01:04:14.611
Six letters, meaning not here

01:04:19.754 --> 01:04:20.812
Absent

01:04:26.761 --> 01:04:29.924
Away, you know? Do you know...

01:04:30.031 --> 01:04:33.432
Where is this house attractive?

01:04:34.135 --> 01:04:36.330
Hey you two

01:04:36.438 --> 01:04:41.068
You and Catherine have chosen a creative life.

01:04:41.176 --> 01:04:42.438
This is really...

01:04:43.345 --> 01:04:47.748
Honestly, she's drawing here.

01:04:47.849 --> 01:04:53.116
You can play in your novels

01:04:53.221 --> 01:04:54.711
Right

01:04:54.823 --> 01:04:57.053
It's a very new thing for me.

01:05:00.295 --> 01:05:03.992
I've always been a bit jealous of the two of you.

01:05:04.099 --> 01:05:07.432
And the decisions you made for yourself

01:05:07.535 --> 01:05:10.470
About this creative life

01:05:28.690 --> 01:05:31.090
But the world is different now.

01:05:33.862 --> 01:05:38.731
The world is full of vitality

01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:42.166
Open and so wonderful

01:05:43.672 --> 01:05:47.540
If I have the chance to start over, start over.

01:05:47.642 --> 01:05:50.543
I dare say I will definitely...

01:05:50.645 --> 01:05:54.877
Developing for the act
of acting Like you

01:05:56.818 --> 01:06:00.652
I really want to have the opportunity to try and act and tell stories.

01:06:00.755 --> 01:06:05.385
You know, temporarily withdrawing

01:06:11.433 --> 01:06:19.204
You know, the world is not seen in appearance.
So open and vibrant

01:06:21.076 --> 01:06:22.805
You should know, Delmar

01:06:22.911 --> 01:06:25.277
Especially after you have tried your life.

01:06:29.317 --> 01:06:30.807
I know

01:06:41.329 --> 01:06:48.667
Six letters, meaning discomfort

01:06:49.504 --> 01:06:50.801
Disease

01:06:52.374 --> 01:06:54.171
-Delma - Catherine.

01:06:54.275 --> 01:06:55.708
- How are you doing?
- very good

01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:57.607
I'm very happy to see you playing crossword puzzles.

01:06:57.679 --> 01:06:59.146
- Yes, how are you?
- very good

01:06:59.247 --> 01:07:01.112
- I'm well thanks.
- That's great.

01:07:01.216 --> 01:07:02.205
What did you buy?

01:07:02.317 --> 01:07:03.341
Drawing

01:07:03.451 --> 01:07:06.943
I have conceived new creations in my mind.

01:07:07.055 --> 01:07:08.682
I can not wait to start painting.

01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:11.588
I still have many pictures to complete.

01:07:11.693 --> 01:07:13.752
Speculate according to the contract we just signed

01:07:13.862 --> 01:07:15.796
I should die in my sleep tonight.

01:07:16.931 --> 01:07:18.592
"I have no problem."
Great.

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:21.294
"How are you writing?"
- proceeding smoothly

01:07:21.403 --> 01:07:22.836
It is? Great

01:07:25.373 --> 01:07:26.499
Well, you recently...

01:07:26.608 --> 01:07:29.076
Hey Patricia, how are
you doing recently?

01:07:42.457 --> 01:07:44.391
Honey, you should not smoke.

01:07:44.492 --> 01:07:47.655
She is smoking in the bedroom.

01:07:47.762 --> 01:07:49.024
Patricia

01:07:49.964 --> 01:07:51.693
Patricia, what are you doing?

01:08:09.717 --> 01:08:10.706
James

01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:23.421
Come on

01:09:43.077 --> 01:09:47.377
I saw you

01:09:47.948 --> 01:09:50.975
I saw you, call

01:09:51.085 --> 01:09:53.212
- Meng Ma - Mammoth

01:09:53.321 --> 01:09:54.788
Snow covered pavement

01:09:55.857 --> 01:09:57.188
Bum animal

01:09:57.292 --> 01:09:58.418
Tree

01:09:59.627 --> 01:10:01.094
Heavy ice

01:10:13.174 --> 01:10:15.039
- unsupervised - Meng Ma

01:10:15.143 --> 01:10:19.375
- One Person - Whales
in Motion, Snow

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:21.539
- Telephone and...
snow

01:10:21.649 --> 01:10:23.844
sea breeze

01:10:23.952 --> 01:10:25.214
Snow

01:10:29.123 --> 01:10:32.092
Wow, who is this?

01:10:35.730 --> 01:10:38.961
God, is she blind?

01:10:46.374 --> 01:10:49.707
Your fingers move line by line

01:10:50.645 --> 01:10:54.445
It can be so fast, it reads line by line.

01:10:56.184 --> 01:10:57.776
I want to take a picture.

01:11:15.837 --> 01:11:18.670
- No.
- It does not matter, it does not matter.

01:11:18.773 --> 01:11:20.263
I know you are there.

01:11:20.375 --> 01:11:22.969
"Sorry to bother you.
"Is there something?"

01:11:23.077 --> 01:11:26.843
I just want to take a photo.

01:11:26.948 --> 01:11:29.280
What are you filming?

01:11:29.384 --> 01:11:31.750
Your hand

01:11:32.453 --> 01:11:36.355
Your hand slides across the page

01:11:37.392 --> 01:11:40.293
I've never seen a bit of reading before.

01:11:40.395 --> 01:11:41.521
It is?

01:11:42.463 --> 01:11:44.328
Yes, how did you do it?

01:11:44.432 --> 01:11:45.922
Oh, it's not that difficult.

01:11:46.034 --> 01:11:50.733
This is just one of many things blind people need to learn.

01:11:50.838 --> 01:11:52.703
How to read by hand?

01:11:52.807 --> 01:11:55.970
This book is all points

01:11:56.077 --> 01:11:59.012
Come and feel

01:12:04.419 --> 01:12:06.250
Can I sit by your side?

01:12:06.354 --> 01:12:08.413
Of course, sit down.

01:12:23.171 --> 01:12:25.571
Sitting alone in the cold wind seems very lonely

01:12:26.207 --> 01:12:29.904
"No, I do not feel alone.
- do not feel lonely

01:12:30.011 --> 01:12:31.501
I like the sound of seawater.

01:12:31.612 --> 01:12:33.773
I like the sound of waves.

01:12:35.883 --> 01:12:40.081
Stray animals and waves

01:12:40.188 --> 01:12:41.883
Thanks for talking to me.

01:12:43.224 --> 01:12:44.521
You are welcome

01:12:49.097 --> 01:12:50.792
- I am leaving now.
- OK

01:12:50.898 --> 01:12:52.627
(I.e.
- Goodbye.

01:13:01.275 --> 01:13:06.975
I want to finish my romance with Braille.

01:13:07.582 --> 01:13:09.812
- what?
- Yes it's right.

01:13:09.917 --> 01:13:14.377
I want to learn how to read and write words.

01:13:15.623 --> 01:13:16.988
Why are you doing this?

01:13:17.959 --> 01:13:20.189
- what?
- Why are you doing this?

01:13:23.364 --> 01:13:25.127
Let me see things from different angles

01:13:25.233 --> 01:13:26.564
Useful for my writing

01:13:27.268 --> 01:13:29.532
Help me think more...

01:13:29.637 --> 01:13:30.865
- What else?
- abstract

01:13:30.972 --> 01:13:37.309
You Do not Need Abstract Thinking, James

01:13:37.412 --> 01:13:38.640
You do not really need

01:13:38.746 --> 01:13:41.738
No, how do you know how to learn words?

01:13:41.849 --> 01:13:43.111
I think it's hard to go to heaven.

01:13:43.217 --> 01:13:45.617
Almost impossible task

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:47.654
- Listen - I mean, definitely...

01:13:47.755 --> 01:13:48.483
listen

01:13:48.589 --> 01:13:50.580
- Do you know what that means?
- what?

01:13:50.691 --> 01:13:52.420
Do you know what it means to learn Braille?

01:13:52.527 --> 01:13:54.222
This means that you are not sure what you want to do

01:13:54.328 --> 01:13:55.158
It is

01:13:55.263 --> 01:13:58.562
It means on the road to write books

01:13:58.666 --> 01:14:00.600
You're divided again, James

01:14:00.701 --> 01:14:02.999
"This is not a distraction.
- That is

01:14:03.104 --> 01:14:06.835
That means listening, I'll say

01:14:08.643 --> 01:14:10.543
That means you have to learn some words, Catherine.

01:14:10.645 --> 01:14:11.543
What?

01:14:11.646 --> 01:14:12.943
Wake up

01:14:13.047 --> 01:14:14.207
- What are you talking about?
Great.

01:14:14.315 --> 01:14:18.081
Did you forget so soon? This nomination

01:14:18.186 --> 01:14:19.949
If I'm dead...

01:14:20.054 --> 01:14:21.180
God.
- You must complete my creation

01:14:21.289 --> 01:14:22.779
If you die, I'll finish your work.

01:14:22.890 --> 01:14:26.018
I do not want to learn words, I do not want to learn.

01:14:26.127 --> 01:14:28.061
- Listen, I'm listening.

01:14:28.162 --> 01:14:33.429
You promised, we agreed
To complete my work

01:14:35.970 --> 01:14:38.063
The efforts of my life

01:14:42.176 --> 01:14:43.666
I wish you good luck.

01:14:44.278 --> 01:14:47.270
I really do not understand.

01:14:47.381 --> 01:14:51.317
Why do people with normal vision force themselves?

01:14:52.854 --> 01:14:55.152
Go learn what words

01:14:55.823 --> 01:14:58.621
I do not know where to find someone who knows the word.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:00.952
In fact, I do not know a blind person.

01:15:01.062 --> 01:15:02.689
I know - The best is

01:15:02.797 --> 01:15:04.890
The woman I met on the beach

01:15:04.999 --> 01:15:06.694
She is jealous, she can not see anything.

01:15:06.801 --> 01:15:08.234
- So what?
- Then I do not know...

01:15:08.336 --> 01:15:10.167
What are you doing?
But that's what I'm doing.

01:15:11.672 --> 01:15:12.764
OK

01:15:45.907 --> 01:15:48.842
There's not even a mark, right?

01:15:50.044 --> 01:15:52.604
Dotted paper only

01:15:59.387 --> 01:16:01.252
Dial the sound from the microphone

01:16:01.355 --> 01:16:03.380
It's James's favorite

01:16:05.359 --> 01:16:08.522
However, he encountered difficulties tonight.

01:16:10.598 --> 01:16:12.498
Something complicated

01:16:14.936 --> 01:16:18.133
Pick up the microphone and dial the

01:16:19.073 --> 01:16:21.234
Not an easy task

01:16:24.378 --> 01:16:27.279
At point A, you are someone At
point B, you are someone else.

01:16:27.381 --> 01:16:29.144
At point C, you become...

01:16:50.571 --> 01:16:51.833
I'll be back soon

01:19:01.769 --> 01:19:04.738
Is it necessary to be so excited? James

01:19:04.839 --> 01:19:08.275
We are all here, you are very excited

01:19:08.375 --> 01:19:10.309
"I'm not excited.
- excited to go crazy

01:19:10.411 --> 01:19:11.844
I just tried to get the job done.

01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:13.969
Wait

01:19:15.349 --> 01:19:18.341
James is above he is screaming

01:19:18.452 --> 01:19:20.352
Who is James?
"James is my brother.

01:19:20.454 --> 01:19:21.580
I can hear you.

01:19:22.389 --> 01:19:24.220
I can hear you talking, Patricia.

01:19:24.325 --> 01:19:25.758
Is anyone else up?

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:28.090
Does he have a gun? Does he have any alcohol?

01:19:28.195 --> 01:19:29.890
He drank lots of water.

01:19:30.898 --> 01:19:32.832
I can hear other sounds.

01:19:34.368 --> 01:19:36.461
I'm not crazy, I'm not sick.

01:19:36.570 --> 01:19:39.539
Do not bother me, I want to do anything.

01:19:40.808 --> 01:19:42.537
I want to read anything.

01:19:44.178 --> 01:19:47.739
I can do this, I'm doing what I want to do.

01:19:48.749 --> 01:19:50.546
I can stay here.

01:19:51.352 --> 01:19:53.377
This table does not have to be here.

01:19:55.589 --> 01:19:57.716
Waiting is a good idea.

01:19:57.825 --> 01:20:00.259
If you can take a while

01:20:00.361 --> 01:20:02.625
Inciting people usually become better controlled

01:20:02.730 --> 01:20:06.131
Patricia, who's this voice?

01:20:06.233 --> 01:20:09.498
Is it Catherine? Where did she go?

01:20:09.603 --> 01:20:11.867
The reason James is crazy is unknown.

01:20:11.972 --> 01:20:14.873
But he is absolutely full of anxiety.

01:20:14.975 --> 01:20:16.840
James, let me in...

01:20:16.944 --> 01:20:18.502
"Talk to you, James.
- no

01:20:19.079 --> 01:20:20.011
Said on the other side of the door

01:20:20.114 --> 01:20:21.672
I hear you have some problems.

01:20:21.782 --> 01:20:22.874
I'm coming to help you.

01:20:22.983 --> 01:20:24.450
I do not need your help.

01:20:24.552 --> 01:20:27.146
I'm just writing a book here.

01:20:27.254 --> 01:20:29.154
James, I'm coming to help you.

01:20:29.256 --> 01:20:30.917
Does not bother me

01:20:31.025 --> 01:20:32.993
- Anybody there?
- Frankenstein

01:20:33.093 --> 01:20:34.526
James?

01:20:34.628 --> 01:20:35.822
Catherine

01:20:36.530 --> 01:20:38.691
- Patricia - Is that right?

01:20:38.799 --> 01:20:40.528
- He 's Delmar.
- Patricia, what happened?

01:20:40.634 --> 01:20:41.601
How could this be?

01:20:41.702 --> 01:20:44.694
Lord, please be quiet.
We want James...

01:20:44.805 --> 01:20:46.796
"Calm down for a while."
James is inside?

01:20:46.907 --> 01:20:48.602
Hey, God.

01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:50.574
I can hear you outside the door.

01:20:51.111 --> 01:20:53.238
James? We have three people

01:20:53.347 --> 01:20:54.974
I'm James, too.
There are five people outside.

01:20:55.082 --> 01:20:56.549
- Sir, please.
- Sir, please be quiet.

01:21:00.387 --> 01:21:02.480
There are three people outside, James

01:21:02.590 --> 01:21:04.888
We want to help, let's go in and help you

01:21:07.695 --> 01:21:09.390
Okay, we have to act.

01:21:09.496 --> 01:21:11.430
The police are ready to enter the room

01:21:11.532 --> 01:21:13.864
Procrastination is still part of the plan.

01:21:15.069 --> 01:21:17.333
Maybe they can win James' trust.

01:21:17.438 --> 01:21:19.429
Avoid causing physical conflicts

01:21:21.976 --> 01:21:23.876
I do not think I need to use sticks.

01:21:23.978 --> 01:21:24.945
(I.e.
Mr.

01:21:29.416 --> 01:21:31.782
James, let's go in and talk to you.

01:21:34.722 --> 01:21:35.654
James

01:21:35.756 --> 01:21:37.451
- Throw it away - What
are you doing behind it?

01:21:37.558 --> 01:21:38.820
Hear Me Now

01:21:38.926 --> 01:21:41.486
We're coming...
Leave and talk to us

01:21:41.595 --> 01:21:43.153
- Take the light.
- We're here to help you.

01:21:43.264 --> 01:21:45.289
- Move quickly, hurry up.
- We're here to help you.

01:21:45.399 --> 01:21:47.196
- will not hurt you - turn
off, turn off the light

01:21:47.301 --> 01:21:48.461
James, listen to me, we...

01:21:48.569 --> 01:21:50.833
I did not promise you to come in, this is my place.

01:21:50.938 --> 01:21:51.802
- Get out - do not

01:21:51.906 --> 01:21:53.965
Get out and talk

01:21:54.842 --> 01:21:57.504
No reason to be so angry, James.

01:21:57.645 --> 01:22:01.581
How do you get to the point where you are now?

01:22:02.116 --> 01:22:03.048
Okay, James.

01:22:03.150 --> 01:22:04.742
What are you going to do with that microphone?

01:22:04.852 --> 01:22:06.717
I want you to put the microphone down, okay?

01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:08.117
You bastard, I want to ruin them.

01:22:08.222 --> 01:22:09.416
We're here to protect you.

01:22:09.523 --> 01:22:10.717
They want to ruin me.

01:22:10.824 --> 01:22:12.621
I have to ruin them, and I have to start first.

01:22:12.726 --> 01:22:13.852
Go get the cushion and go

01:22:13.961 --> 01:22:16.589
You have to try to calm down.

01:22:16.697 --> 01:22:18.096
Patricia and Delmar

01:22:18.198 --> 01:22:20.826
I'm worried about you.
- James, hang up the phone.

01:22:20.935 --> 01:22:22.300
James, let it go, let it go

01:22:22.403 --> 01:22:24.496
Lower the phone

01:22:24.605 --> 01:22:26.334
We can be friends, I'll protect you.

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:29.000
I want this phone.
"I want to be your friend, James.

01:22:29.109 --> 01:22:30.303
I wanna be yours...

01:22:37.818 --> 01:22:39.809
James, relax.
James

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:41.148
"Relax, James.
- Do not touch me.

01:22:41.255 --> 01:22:42.244
- It's all right.
James

01:22:42.356 --> 01:22:44.586
Do not touch me, you still play

01:22:44.692 --> 01:22:46.091
James, relax

01:22:46.193 --> 01:22:48.320
James is full of anxiety

01:22:48.929 --> 01:22:50.726
- He's confused.
Relax

01:22:50.831 --> 01:22:53.925
- I am here.
"Ladies, you can not come in."

01:22:54.034 --> 01:22:55.968
I'm here, James.
- turned around

01:22:57.004 --> 01:22:59.837
Even so, he feels pain like we do.

01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:01.635
- Do not touch me.
Relax

01:23:01.742 --> 01:23:04.870
James's resistance is caused by muscle spasms

01:23:05.379 --> 01:23:07.643
Frightened and scared as he

01:23:07.748 --> 01:23:10.979
The more pain he has, the more he fights.

01:23:12.252 --> 01:23:14.584
Today, the hand and voice of the police

01:23:14.688 --> 01:23:17.384
And his calm rhythm
Helping James

01:23:17.491 --> 01:23:20.187
Make the most of the damage

01:23:20.294 --> 01:23:21.556
I can hear you.

01:23:22.196 --> 01:23:23.458
I can hear you.

01:23:27.868 --> 01:23:31.565
Do not worry, James, it will be better.

01:23:35.976 --> 01:23:36.908
James?

01:23:37.011 --> 01:23:38.342
They got out

01:23:38.445 --> 01:23:40.606
Hey, James, I'm here.

01:23:41.048 --> 01:23:43.016
- James - You

01:23:43.117 --> 01:23:44.880
You angry gay

01:23:44.985 --> 01:23:45.849
- Let's go.
James

01:23:45.953 --> 01:23:48.444
- I'll go with you.
gay

01:23:48.555 --> 01:23:49.283
James

01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:54.327
Gay gay

01:23:54.428 --> 01:23:55.895
James, I'm with you.

01:23:55.996 --> 01:23:57.623
Calm down, my God.

01:23:57.731 --> 01:23:59.460
Oh, my God, James?

01:26:36.056 --> 01:26:38.650
Sometimes people choose to accept

01:26:40.494 --> 01:26:43.691
Sometimes people choose to leave

01:27:36.450 --> 01:27:41.945
Everything needs to be created You
need to trust someone's hands

01:27:57.571 --> 01:28:03.100
At the time I was sitting on the
wall I'm sitting on the floor

01:28:04.344 --> 01:28:07.108
I sat on the floor and listened

01:28:08.982 --> 01:28:12.543
All I can do is listen.

01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:15.047
I do not feel so slow

01:28:17.391 --> 01:28:20.622
I've never been, this is humiliated

01:28:20.727 --> 01:28:23.252
I've never been humiliated in this life.

01:28:23.764 --> 01:28:25.288
My life

01:28:27.234 --> 01:28:33.537
I have trouble calming down to work.
Things are not organized in order.

01:28:34.341 --> 01:28:38.744
You have to sit down and tidy them up nicely.

01:28:43.016 --> 01:28:44.847
I just want to think a lot

01:28:45.352 --> 01:28:48.480
Write down the whole brain idea

01:28:50.524 --> 01:28:54.358
Drawing, painting, writing

01:28:55.162 --> 01:28:58.461
Thoughtful, full of ideas

01:29:06.673 --> 01:29:09.665
- Patricia.
- Catherine.

01:29:18.051 --> 01:29:22.181
One day, many days, there were no white whales at the time.

01:29:22.289 --> 01:29:27.226
So hit, there is

01:29:28.128 --> 01:29:30.494
And there will always be

01:29:33.166 --> 01:29:38.433
This requires an artist
Everything needs to be created

01:29:39.339 --> 01:29:41.603
You need to trust someone's hands.

01:29:45.312 --> 01:29:48.247
It's like a heavy burden, right?

01:29:48.348 --> 01:29:50.612
Yes

01:29:52.252 --> 01:29:54.777
I tried not to think so, James.

01:29:56.123 --> 01:30:01.561
This can not be thought of, it is very fragile

01:30:01.661 --> 01:30:06.689
Yes, it is so fragile.

01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:18.373
So I need to make a contract

01:30:20.814 --> 01:30:22.145
An agreement

01:30:30.624 --> 01:30:32.251
Let's go home.

01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:35.719
- Let's go.
- OK

01:30:37.998 --> 01:30:42.367
Listen, we like each other, right?

01:30:43.069 --> 01:30:44.263
Right

01:30:44.371 --> 01:30:46.305
We met a long time ago.

01:30:46.406 --> 01:30:47.270
Yes

01:30:47.374 --> 01:30:49.365
- We understand each other's creations.
Yes, James.

01:30:49.476 --> 01:30:51.501
And we trust each other.

01:30:52.345 --> 01:30:53.505
Yes

01:33:09.382 --> 01:33:13.512
The most difficult balance is with yourself

01:33:15.555 --> 01:33:16.920
Right?

01:33:20.493 --> 01:33:22.961
I can only see his head.

01:33:25.198 --> 01:33:27.428
I know his face has white makeup.

01:33:28.902 --> 01:33:30.233
But I can not see

01:33:31.705 --> 01:33:34.538
Because I can only see his head.

01:33:51.224 --> 01:33:54.625
Hey, what do you want to do?

01:33:57.497 --> 01:33:59.362
He's just an avatar, do not listen to him.

01:34:01.635 --> 01:34:03.193
He's just an avatar

01:34:22.389 --> 01:34:28.794
There is no such thing as discomfort at all.
Some are just that

01:34:29.963 --> 01:34:31.328
Then this

01:34:33.833 --> 01:34:35.164
These are

01:34:39.239 --> 01:34:40.672
It is

01:34:47.247 --> 01:34:49.477
Just positive thinking

01:34:50.717 --> 01:34:58.317
Now we only have "up" in our conversation.

01:35:18.378 --> 01:35:23.975
I slowly go back

01:35:26.653 --> 01:35:30.145
Slowly, very slowly

01:35:32.459 --> 01:35:39.388
Until my back touches the wall

01:35:49.442 --> 01:35:53.435
About ten minutes, right, ten minutes

01:35:55.281 --> 01:35:56.771
No, it's ten minutes.

01:36:00.186 --> 01:36:02.984
Like the button you pressed the walkie-talkie

01:36:03.757 --> 01:36:06.191
Waiting to hear who's there

01:36:06.926 --> 01:36:08.052
It is

01:36:12.732 --> 01:36:14.199
I chose a pie chart.

01:36:16.369 --> 01:36:17.631
Turn on the radio

01:36:26.045 --> 01:36:27.535
This is the tail of a whale.

01:36:32.752 --> 01:36:34.447
I do not know how real it is.

01:36:41.861 --> 01:36:45.991
Sometimes I wake up and I like to talk to myself.

01:37:05.885 --> 01:37:08.353
I like the sound coming from the microphone.

01:37:09.305 --> 01:37:15.932
