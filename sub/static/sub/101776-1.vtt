00:21.791 --> 00:28.166
[preacher on radio] It is the year
of our Lord 1997, an age of prosperity.

00:28.833 --> 00:33.458
The magnificence of God's creation,
the bounty of this Earth,

00:33.541 --> 00:38.666
the miracle of modern life have never been
so resplendent to our eyes.

00:39.250 --> 00:40.833
Yet for some of us,

00:41.583 --> 00:47.708
the American dream, the singular hope
of our people, remains ever out of reach.

00:47.791 --> 00:50.041
-[man 1] Amen! That's right, Preacher!
-[man 2] Yes, sir!

00:50.125 --> 00:54.708
[preacher] And though we may feel
embittered, want to rail at injustice,

00:54.791 --> 00:56.458
even in our God…

00:57.625 --> 01:00.000
And though others may scorn our beliefs,

01:00.750 --> 01:06.916
let us hold faith not only in that God,
but in ourselves and our character.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.666
-[woman 1] Yes! Amen!
-[man 3] Amen!

01:09.750 --> 01:13.375
[preacher]
Our ability to rise, yea, to fly,

01:13.458 --> 01:19.458
be this flight generations in the making,
be it delayed so long our faith is bound.

01:20.708 --> 01:22.666
Let that faith never be broken.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.708
-[woman 2] Yes, Father God!
-[men] Amen!

01:24.791 --> 01:29.250
[preacher] At a time when families
across the world are falling apart…

01:30.708 --> 01:32.000
[engine sputters]

01:32.083 --> 01:34.416
-[Papaw] Where are you going, J.D.?
-[J.D.] Swim hole!

01:34.500 --> 01:36.333
[Papaw] Don't get bit by a cottonmouth.

01:39.458 --> 01:41.000
[J.D.] When people ask where I'm from,

01:41.083 --> 01:44.333
I say Ohio 'cause that's where I lived
most of my life,

01:44.416 --> 01:46.375
but that's only part of my story.

01:48.583 --> 01:50.583
Ask me where I feel most at home,

01:51.291 --> 01:53.833
that's the hill country,
Jackson, Kentucky.

01:57.541 --> 02:00.125
Down those hollers
is where I spent every summer.

02:00.750 --> 02:03.166
Hands down the best part of my childhood.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.833
It's where my people come from.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Whoa.

02:11.000 --> 02:11.833
Hey.

02:23.041 --> 02:24.041
[grunts]

02:25.291 --> 02:26.708
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:29.791 --> 02:30.916
What you got there?

02:31.708 --> 02:32.625
It's a, uh…

02:33.500 --> 02:34.833
it's a turtle. See?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.833
-Shell's cracked. Pull it off.
-[chuckles] No.

02:38.916 --> 02:42.833
It can't live without his shell.
Ribcage is fused to the carapace.

02:43.333 --> 02:47.625
-Chuck it. See how far you can throw it.
-[J.D.] No. No, they can heal, okay?

02:47.708 --> 02:48.666
[Nate] Whatever.

02:53.083 --> 02:55.291
-[Bev] Why isn't anybody packed?
-[Lindsay] I am.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.416
I told Kevin we'd be home by 1:00.

02:57.500 --> 03:01.125
-Hey, old woman. You packed?
-What's your rush, Bev? Got a hot date?

03:01.208 --> 03:04.791
Yeah, with not being bored off my ass.
Next time I'll bring Chip.

03:04.875 --> 03:07.541
No, you ain't.
We don't need that drama here.

03:07.625 --> 03:08.541
Just get your stuff!

03:09.125 --> 03:12.250
Perch and swivel. I'll go when I'm ready.

03:12.333 --> 03:14.250
-Real nice, Mom.
-[Uncle Pet] Fire in the hole!

03:14.333 --> 03:16.125
-[engine starts]
-Yeah!

03:16.208 --> 03:18.625
-Where's your brother at?
-He rode off.

03:18.708 --> 03:21.375
You couldn't keep an eye on him
for two seconds?

03:40.833 --> 03:42.041
[muffled laughing]

03:42.625 --> 03:44.125
[J.D. screaming]

03:44.208 --> 03:47.041
-[boy 1] Yeah, get him!
-[boy 2] Hey! He's coming up!

03:47.125 --> 03:49.375
-[Dane] Go back to Ohio, boy!
-[boy 1] Keep him under!

03:50.041 --> 03:51.041
[Dane] Pussy!

03:55.666 --> 03:57.458
[muffled laughing]

04:00.041 --> 04:01.958
-[J.D. gasps]
-[Dane] Get outta here.

04:02.666 --> 04:06.000
[J.D.] Things could get tough
down in Jackson in a heartbeat,

04:06.083 --> 04:09.583
but Mamaw and Papaw taught me
that you never start a fight.

04:10.125 --> 04:13.625
But if someone starts one with you,
make damn sure you end it.

04:13.708 --> 04:17.541
[Dane] Crawl on back to your mama, pussy.
Tell her I'll be over tonight.

04:18.625 --> 04:22.208
-[boy 2] Aw, here he comes!
-[boy 1] Yeah, Dane! Punk!

04:22.291 --> 04:25.791
[J.D.] If you can't end it,
your people will always have your back.

04:25.875 --> 04:27.083
Get off him!

04:27.166 --> 04:31.208
[J.D.] And that was our code,
and to me, our code was everything.

04:32.750 --> 04:35.666
-Get off him!
-What the hell you think you're doing?

04:35.750 --> 04:36.708
You son of a bitch.

04:36.791 --> 04:41.500
I oughta put my foot up your ass so far,
you gonna have hemorrhoids for ten years.

04:41.583 --> 04:43.833
-You Hugh McCall's boy?
-Eat shit, old man.

04:43.916 --> 04:45.041
[boy 2] Ooh!

04:47.083 --> 04:48.916
Get your ass outta here
before I call your pa.

04:50.125 --> 04:51.166
Freak.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.166
-[Uncle Arch] Come on, J.D.
-[wheezing]

05:00.416 --> 05:01.875
What happened to you?

05:01.958 --> 05:04.500
[Papaw] Well, he tried
to get hisself into a fight.

05:04.583 --> 05:07.375
Of all the lamebrain ways
to get out of going home…

05:08.250 --> 05:11.000
-Who did that? I'll kill him.
-Mom, come on.

05:11.083 --> 05:13.000
I'll kill him.
Give me a name. C'mon.

05:13.083 --> 05:16.083
Hugh McCall's boy
and a couple other little assholes.

05:16.166 --> 05:18.791
That McCall boy had an idea,
it'd die of loneliness.

05:18.875 --> 05:20.500
-Will you get him some ice?
-Yup!

05:20.583 --> 05:24.791
Did you tell them dickhead bastards
the three of them ain't worth one Vance?

05:24.875 --> 05:26.583
-[Bev] Of course he did!
-Good boy.

05:26.666 --> 05:28.416
-[Bev] All right.
-It'll be all right.

05:28.500 --> 05:31.208
-Are you all right?
-I'm all right, Mom.

05:31.291 --> 05:33.416
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

05:36.291 --> 05:38.041
[chuckles] Get your things!

05:38.125 --> 05:39.125
[all laughing]

05:39.208 --> 05:43.083
Whoo! And dry off! I ain't sitting
next to that for three hours!

05:43.166 --> 05:44.333
[all continue laughing]

05:46.083 --> 05:48.833
[man] You know you gonna be starving
in 45 minutes anyway.

05:49.500 --> 05:53.250
Let's get the family picture 'fore we go.
Bev, get over here.

05:53.333 --> 05:55.375
God forbid,
we get on the road before noon.

05:55.458 --> 05:58.916
-[Lori] Where are we gonna do it?
-Over there. Lori, stand by your sister.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.916
I want the sisters together.
Everybody, look at the camera. C'mon.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
[camera clicks]

06:16.750 --> 06:18.000
C'mon, let's go.

06:18.083 --> 06:20.458
I've had about all the Kentucky
I can take.

06:20.541 --> 06:21.875
[Lori] Bye, Daddy. Love you!

06:21.958 --> 06:23.916
-Bye-bye.
-[Mamaw] See you soon.

06:25.708 --> 06:28.666
Why can't we stay longer?
We're always the first ones to leave.

06:28.750 --> 06:30.708
I don't get why you ever left Jackson.

06:30.791 --> 06:34.291
'Cause when you're knocked up at 13,
you get the hell out of Dodge. That's why.

06:48.916 --> 06:52.041
[J.D.] When I was a kid,
I couldn't make sense of it.

06:52.875 --> 06:55.291
Imagining Mamaw at almost my same age

06:55.375 --> 06:59.000
just running, pregnant,
from everything she knew,

06:59.083 --> 07:01.250
every scrap of family she had.

07:03.666 --> 07:08.666
I felt like I'd stumbled onto something.
A puzzle piece, an answer to a question

07:08.750 --> 07:13.416
I had barely begun to ask
about our family and what became of us.

08:54.291 --> 08:56.583
Oh, thank God. Back to civilization.

08:57.125 --> 08:58.875
[Lindsay] Kevin's here. [squeals]

08:58.958 --> 09:00.666
-J.D., get my stuff.
-[J.D.] No.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.250
I wouldn't call Middletown civilization.

09:04.333 --> 09:06.416
Kevin! Hi! [giggles]

09:08.791 --> 09:13.000
[Mamaw chuckling] Hey!
Aw, now, there's my little buddy.

09:13.083 --> 09:14.958
Bev, give me some of them ribs.

09:16.041 --> 09:18.291
His no-good mother behind the curtains.

09:18.375 --> 09:21.583
Wouldn't spit on her ass
if her guts were on fire.

09:22.625 --> 09:26.250
[chuckles] Here ya go, little buddy. Here.

09:27.333 --> 09:30.041
All right. You take that home.

09:30.583 --> 09:32.583
-All right.
-Thank you.

09:32.666 --> 09:34.625
[chuckles] You're welcome. All right.

09:35.625 --> 09:37.000
[Lindsay giggles] Let's go!

09:37.083 --> 09:40.208
I'm gonna head on down to my place.
See ya tomorrow.

09:40.291 --> 09:42.250
-Night, y'all.
-[J.D.] Goodnight, Mamaw.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.458
[coughing]

10:11.916 --> 10:14.625
-Good night, daughter.
-[Bev] Night, Dad. See ya tomorrow.

10:24.166 --> 10:28.125
[J.D.] Whatever better life
my grandparents had chased up Route 23,

10:28.208 --> 10:29.458
they never caught it.

10:30.458 --> 10:33.250
We were all different
in Middletown somehow.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.250
I don't know, like something was missing.

10:36.875 --> 10:38.125
Maybe hope.

11:01.958 --> 11:02.875
[clicks]

11:09.083 --> 11:10.583
-Paycheck.
-Sorry. Thanks.

11:11.083 --> 11:13.000
You couldn't get to Yale on Route 23,

11:13.083 --> 11:17.458
but I'd come closer than any of 'em
to that dream of something better.

11:17.541 --> 11:20.208
I could see it
right there in front of me.

11:20.958 --> 11:24.375
But a part of me knew
the road from here to there is rocky.

11:24.458 --> 11:25.458
[bell tolling]

11:25.541 --> 11:28.250
[J.D.] There's no way around but through.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.875
[softly] What? Put it away.

11:35.958 --> 11:37.583
-Eat it.
-No, I have to study.

11:37.666 --> 11:40.666
-Usha, you have to eat.
-They'll boot me if they see food in here.

11:42.083 --> 11:44.375
I'll cover for you. Come on.

11:49.708 --> 11:50.708
[Usha] Mm!

11:51.583 --> 11:53.041
-[J.D.] Stop! They're coming!
-What?

11:53.125 --> 11:54.916
Put it away! They know!
They're coming!

11:55.000 --> 11:56.250
-Okay.
-The cameras!

11:56.333 --> 12:00.791
They're gonna take you to the dungeons,
Usha, the famous Yale dungeons! [laughs]

12:00.875 --> 12:04.208
[laughing] You jerk! Stop!
Do you want some?

12:04.291 --> 12:06.750
No, I have a dinner tonight.

12:06.833 --> 12:09.583
-You're gonna do great.
-[sighs]

12:09.666 --> 12:11.833
-Are you nervous? What's going on?
-No.

12:11.916 --> 12:15.208
I'm going to shine up
against the triple Ivy League types.

12:15.291 --> 12:18.916
If you're desperate,
talk about the Hatfield-McCoy thing.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.958
-I never should have told you that.
-[laughs]

12:21.041 --> 12:22.125
This is ridiculous.

12:22.208 --> 12:25.375
Hey. You're gonna get this, okay?

12:25.458 --> 12:29.458
I have to 'cause I'm not letting you
go to D.C. without me.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.916
I don't want to be there without you.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.500
[chuckles softly]

12:40.458 --> 12:41.916
I have a meeting.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.958
-Mm.
-But I love you.

12:46.666 --> 12:47.958
I love you.

12:48.041 --> 12:49.541
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

12:50.250 --> 12:51.458
I love you back.

12:55.833 --> 12:56.750
Thanks.

13:03.833 --> 13:06.458
-[Jill] Hey, J.D., good to see you.
-Hey. Yeah.

13:06.541 --> 13:08.916
So you got your aid package for next year?

13:09.791 --> 13:12.541
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.541
I know.
It's not as much as the first year.

13:15.625 --> 13:19.958
Jill, I'm working three jobs.
I still can't afford $21,000.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.750
How's firm week going?

13:23.333 --> 13:27.541
It's going. I got a callback,
a dinner tonight, interviews tomorrow--

13:27.625 --> 13:31.625
The standard salary for a summer associate
is well over $30,000.

13:31.708 --> 13:34.875
If I get the job. What if I don't?

13:34.958 --> 13:37.125
I'm looking for a contingency plan.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.000
Is there one?

13:39.833 --> 13:41.875
I'd do more for you if I could.

13:43.333 --> 13:45.708
You're gonna get one of these jobs, J.D.

13:46.291 --> 13:47.708
I'm sure of it.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.958
[indistinct chatter]

13:51.041 --> 13:53.250
[J.D.] I would definitely consider
a clerkship,

13:53.333 --> 13:56.083
but I could also see myself
going the firm route, as well.

13:56.166 --> 13:59.125
Makes perfect sense.
Keep your options open.

14:00.125 --> 14:02.041
Let's introduce you around.

14:02.125 --> 14:04.708
Perfect. There's actually someone
I was hoping to meet.

14:04.791 --> 14:07.000
Holly! You made it!

14:07.083 --> 14:09.000
Brooks! Yes, I did.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.541
[man] As an editor at the Journal,

14:12.625 --> 14:16.208
I had the opportunity
to meet with all the top firms,

14:16.291 --> 14:18.166
so I would consider something…

14:18.250 --> 14:19.083
Excuse me.

14:19.833 --> 14:21.041
Call me Tuesday.

14:22.250 --> 14:23.416
Care for wine, sir?

14:24.625 --> 14:27.208
Have some. They're serving the good stuff.

14:27.291 --> 14:28.208
Red or white?

14:28.291 --> 14:29.458
White is fine.

14:29.541 --> 14:32.083
Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc?

14:35.333 --> 14:36.375
Try the Chardonnay.

14:38.708 --> 14:40.541
-Thank you.
-You were saying…

14:40.625 --> 14:42.958
-[cell phone vibrates]
-Yes, I-- Sorry.

14:46.208 --> 14:49.791
Um, so, my girlfriend
has a summer position in D.C.,

14:49.875 --> 14:52.041
and I was hoping
to talk to Phillip Roseman

14:52.125 --> 14:54.375
-because his firm--
-There he is right there.

14:54.458 --> 14:55.875
Tall guy with the glasses.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.000
Remind me. Where did you go for undergrad?

15:00.083 --> 15:03.166
-Ohio State.
-Right. Plenty of great state schools.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.958
[indistinct chatter]

15:14.000 --> 15:16.500
[Phillip] …corporate lawyer father
upset about that?

15:16.583 --> 15:19.333
[man] Oh, of course.
We all have our share of that, too.

15:21.583 --> 15:24.583
So litigation, pretty big transition.

15:24.666 --> 15:25.833
Is this seat taken?

15:26.875 --> 15:27.708
Go ahead.

15:29.708 --> 15:30.666
Phillip Roseman.

15:31.458 --> 15:33.875
Uh, J.D. Vance. Thanks.

15:34.916 --> 15:38.000
That's the thing to do.
That's what I did my first summer.

15:38.083 --> 15:42.666
…cutthroat nature of it all.
I wanted to focus on the laws. [laughs]

15:50.375 --> 15:51.958
You on the Journal?

15:52.541 --> 15:54.791
-No, I didn't get in this time.
-Too bad.

15:55.875 --> 16:00.083
-I'm gonna try again, though.
-Lot of firms won't touch you without it.

16:00.666 --> 16:02.583
Yes, sir. That's what I've heard.

16:05.916 --> 16:07.875
Will you excuse me? I'm sorry.

16:11.750 --> 16:13.500
[cell phone vibrates]

16:14.625 --> 16:15.458
J.D.?

16:15.541 --> 16:17.583
Why are there so many fuckin' forks?

16:17.666 --> 16:20.291
Usha, what am I supposed to do
with all these forks?

16:20.791 --> 16:24.250
They had two different kinds
of white wine. It's like a test.

16:24.333 --> 16:25.250
[Usha] It is a test.

16:25.333 --> 16:28.041
Next time
just say you'll have whatever's driest.

16:28.125 --> 16:28.958
[J.D.] Driest, okay.

16:29.541 --> 16:32.875
Listen,
use the silverware from the outside in.

16:32.958 --> 16:36.125
If the knife has a funny edge,
it's for fish.

16:36.208 --> 16:38.458
If the spoon's too big, it's for soup,

16:38.541 --> 16:41.208
and the spoon at the top,
that's for dessert.

16:41.291 --> 16:45.666
Try this: put your first finger
and your thumb together on each hand.

16:46.458 --> 16:48.125
-What?
-[Usha] Do it. Just do it.

16:49.750 --> 16:53.666
You have "D" for drink on the right
and "B" for bread on the left.

16:54.416 --> 16:56.083
-Got it?
-Okay.

16:56.166 --> 16:57.916
Now put your hands up to your eyes.

17:00.166 --> 17:03.333
-Now what?
-Oh, my God. You actually did it?

17:03.416 --> 17:04.500
[chuckling] Oh, my God.

17:04.583 --> 17:07.791
Oh, my God. I'm such an idiot.
Why are you with me?

17:07.875 --> 17:12.458
Well, because you're not a douchebag
and you don't know how to use forks.

17:12.541 --> 17:16.000
You got a callback at the best firm.
Are you registering that?

17:16.875 --> 17:18.541
It's just a dinner, right?

17:18.625 --> 17:22.958
Just a dinner, piece of cake.
Thank you, spirit guide.

17:23.583 --> 17:27.625
-Ah, don't mention it. Okay, bye.
-Bye.

17:29.125 --> 17:30.250
[cell phone vibrates]

17:32.000 --> 17:35.166
Jesus, Linds. What is it?
I'm at a dinner interview thing.

17:35.250 --> 17:36.583
[Lindsay] It's Mom.

17:37.541 --> 17:39.625
She's in the hospital.

17:39.708 --> 17:41.875
Well, is she okay? What happened?

17:42.708 --> 17:44.125
She started using again.

17:44.208 --> 17:45.208
[sighs]

17:46.541 --> 17:48.958
I can't do this right now.

17:49.041 --> 17:50.166
Heroin.

17:51.541 --> 17:52.500
What?

17:54.083 --> 17:55.500
She OD'd.

17:55.583 --> 17:56.666
[breathing heavily]

18:02.166 --> 18:05.750
"'Class, this is a tadpole,'
said Mr. Shepherd."

18:05.833 --> 18:07.625
What do you think a tadpole becomes?

18:07.708 --> 18:08.791
-Frog!
-[Bev] A frog!

18:10.291 --> 18:12.791
-J.D., go long! It's for you!
-[all cheer]

18:12.875 --> 18:15.583
-[Bev] That's my boy! [laughs]
-[J.D. laughs]

18:26.125 --> 18:28.500
[Bev sobbing]

18:30.958 --> 18:32.208
Mom?

18:40.666 --> 18:41.916
[inhales sharply]

18:55.375 --> 18:56.541
Did I do something?

18:58.791 --> 18:59.875
[continues sobbing]

19:11.375 --> 19:14.541
[Brett] I told her the only progeny
I want are billable hours.

19:14.625 --> 19:15.625
[all laugh]

19:17.875 --> 19:19.958
-[Rich] That's good.
-You all right?

19:20.791 --> 19:22.708
Yes, sir. I'm fine. Thank you.

19:23.208 --> 19:25.708
Did you meet Rich and Pamela?

19:25.791 --> 19:26.958
-Hi.
-[J.D.] Hello.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.000
-Great to meet you, J.D.
-Good to meet you, sir.

19:30.083 --> 19:33.875
[Rich] Brett was just telling us
about his remarkable transformation

19:33.958 --> 19:37.416
from Harvard Business School grad
to Yale law student.

19:38.291 --> 19:40.541
So… what's your story?

19:40.625 --> 19:43.833
Well, I'm from Ohio,
but my family is from Kentucky.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.208
-Bluegrass State.
-Yes, sir.

19:45.291 --> 19:48.208
I joined the Marines out of high school,
served in Iraq.

19:48.291 --> 19:49.708
-Wow.
-It was a great experience.

19:49.791 --> 19:52.375
It helped pay for college.

19:52.458 --> 19:54.375
-It's the American dream.
-[J.D.] Exactly.

19:54.458 --> 19:57.500
Then I finished up
and got my degree in two years.

19:57.583 --> 20:00.500
So your family, were they, uh,
coal miners?

20:00.583 --> 20:03.916
No, actually, my grandfather went north
to work at a steel plant

20:04.000 --> 20:06.375
like a lot of folks from Appalachia did.

20:13.666 --> 20:16.791
They were actually
sort of hillbilly royalty

20:16.875 --> 20:20.791
because my Papaw was related to the guy
who started the Hatfield-McCoy feud.

20:20.875 --> 20:22.000
-Really?
-Yes, ma'am.

20:22.083 --> 20:24.666
-No kidding.
-I just saw that miniseries.

20:24.750 --> 20:25.750
[Rich chuckling]

20:26.250 --> 20:27.833
What's it like when you go back?

20:28.791 --> 20:31.750
I don't really get
a lot of chances to go back.

20:32.625 --> 20:34.833
It must feel
like you're from another planet.

20:36.875 --> 20:39.125
Yeah, uh, you know, I guess.

20:39.208 --> 20:43.208
Like, you know,
"Who are all these rednecks?" [laughs]

20:43.291 --> 20:45.208
We don't really use that term.

20:45.291 --> 20:48.333
Oh, no. Yeah, that's not at all what…

20:49.083 --> 20:50.625
It's just, you know,

20:50.708 --> 20:54.125
I mean, you're at a top
educational institutions in the world--

20:54.208 --> 20:56.750
My mother was salutatorian
of her high school.

20:56.833 --> 21:00.208
Smartest person I've met,
probably smarter than anyone in this room.

21:01.291 --> 21:02.666
Maybe so.

21:02.750 --> 21:05.625
Well, I didn't mean any disrespect.

21:07.416 --> 21:09.375
Looks like you failed on that one.

21:10.791 --> 21:14.250
It sounds like we should
be offering your mother a position.

21:14.333 --> 21:15.916
[all chuckling]

21:23.291 --> 21:25.875
How'd it get so bad?
You had to have known.

21:25.958 --> 21:28.416
[Lindsay]
I can't be with her every minute.

21:28.500 --> 21:29.916
I've got my own shit.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.541
Kevin's Bronco keeps breaking down,
and now he's working nights

21:33.625 --> 21:36.208
and I'm the one
that's got to get it fixed.

21:36.291 --> 21:41.958
And this dirtbag
Mom's been screwing, Ray, is a junkie.

21:42.041 --> 21:45.083
And with Aunt Lori gone, it's all on me.

21:45.666 --> 21:47.500
-Guys!
-[girl] No, he did not!

21:47.583 --> 21:50.958
[shouting] Guys, I am trying to talk
to your uncle! Stop it!

21:52.708 --> 21:54.000
Sorry for yelling.

21:55.291 --> 21:58.875
-I'm sorry I haven't been there, Lindsay.
-Can you come now?

22:04.041 --> 22:07.791
I can't. It's Interview Week
and if I'm not here, I just--

22:07.875 --> 22:09.166
Can't you come home?

22:18.541 --> 22:21.625
-["I Wanna Dance with Somebody" playing]
-Why do we do this every year?

22:21.708 --> 22:23.708
'Cause it's what we do. That's why.

22:23.791 --> 22:25.291
Couldn't we hide the old ones?

22:25.375 --> 22:28.875
At Christmas, I can rewrap your presents
and put it under a fake tree.

22:28.958 --> 22:30.041
Would you like that?

22:30.125 --> 22:31.083
-[scoffs]
-[TV playing]

22:31.166 --> 22:33.375
[Bev] Can you turn down your show?
I can't hear Whitney.

22:33.458 --> 22:34.916
She sounds better that way.

22:36.208 --> 22:37.416
Wiseass.

22:39.083 --> 22:40.916
Come on. Mom, I'm watching Gore.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.125
[Bev] You made this one
when you were five.

22:45.416 --> 22:46.250
I was ten.

22:46.333 --> 22:49.333
Whatever. It's a memory
and I'm gonna have it when I'm old.

22:49.416 --> 22:51.083
-I just have to--
-[Bev] Lindsay?

22:52.625 --> 22:53.791
What?

22:54.791 --> 22:57.458
-It's Kevin.
-I don't care if it's the baby Jesus.

22:57.541 --> 23:00.000
It's Easter, God damn it.
Get your ass in here.

23:01.416 --> 23:02.375
[Lindsay] I gotta go.

23:03.833 --> 23:04.833
[Bev] "It's Kevin."

23:05.708 --> 23:06.791
It's always Kevin.

23:07.916 --> 23:09.500
What do you want me to do?

23:09.583 --> 23:12.541
Blow an egg or help out
with Mamaw's basket. Git!

23:12.625 --> 23:14.333
-[Lindsay] Ugh!
-What do I even put on it?

23:15.083 --> 23:17.583
-Be creative. What will she like?
-Menthols.

23:17.666 --> 23:20.291
-[J.D. laughs]
-She likes flowers. Make one out of this.

23:25.458 --> 23:26.458
[knocking on door]

23:26.541 --> 23:27.958
[Chip] Hey-hey!
Hope someone's home.

23:28.041 --> 23:30.625
I hope that's Chip.
He got something for you two.

23:31.500 --> 23:32.541
Come in! Come on.

23:33.375 --> 23:34.208
-[J.D.] What?
-Hey.

23:35.208 --> 23:38.708
-What do you think, J.D.?
-[Bev] Don't just sit there. It's yours!

23:38.791 --> 23:39.708
[Lindsay] Aww!

23:39.791 --> 23:42.458
[J.D.] What do we name him?
This is great.

23:42.541 --> 23:45.541
-Jesus. How big is that thing gonna get?
-He was the best one.

23:45.625 --> 23:46.500
[Lindsay laughs]

23:46.583 --> 23:48.083
-What do you say?
-[Lindsay] Hi.

23:48.166 --> 23:50.333
-What do you say?
-Thank you.

23:50.416 --> 23:51.916
Take him outside.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.833
-[J.D.] He's good-looking.
-Look at his paws.

23:53.916 --> 23:55.500
-Take him outside.
-[Lindsay] Come here.

23:55.583 --> 23:56.833
-Get him!
-[J.D.] I got him!

23:56.916 --> 23:58.500
Get him before he pisses!

23:58.583 --> 24:00.458
-[J.D.] Come here.
-He is sniffing around--

24:00.541 --> 24:02.041
-He's going in my room!
-Oh, no.

24:02.125 --> 24:03.958
Get him before he ruins my rug!

24:08.791 --> 24:10.958
Bad dog. You are a bad dog!

24:11.041 --> 24:12.875
He does that again,
I'll fucking kill him!

24:12.958 --> 24:15.125
-You're the one that wanted a dog!
-[Lindsay] Mom!

24:19.875 --> 24:23.000
He just pisses wherever the hell he wants.

24:23.583 --> 24:25.791
Should fit in just fine around here.
[laughs]

24:27.416 --> 24:30.750
You take him outside.
[sniffles] I'll pick up the piss.

24:30.833 --> 24:32.541
-[J.D.] I can take him.
-Making messes.

24:32.625 --> 24:34.875
-Here's the leash.
-Give me that, okay?

24:34.958 --> 24:37.625
-I can take him!
-Okay, but be careful.

24:37.708 --> 24:39.500
-[dog barking]
-[J.D. grunting]

24:39.583 --> 24:41.541
-[J.D.] I got him!
-[Lindsay] Get it!

24:42.500 --> 24:44.083
-[Bev] J.D.!
-[J.D.] I didn't mean--

24:44.166 --> 24:47.041
How many times have I told you
not to be so fucking careless?

24:47.125 --> 24:48.458
-I'm sorry!
-You're sorry?

24:48.541 --> 24:50.333
"I'm sorry." Go to your room!

24:50.916 --> 24:52.541
C'mon, babe. They're just eggs.`

24:52.625 --> 24:56.416
Oh, fuck you. Those are heirlooms.
My family heirlooms.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
-[door thuds]
-[Bev grunts and sniffles]

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
[door opens]

25:20.333 --> 25:24.208
Who's that? One of them chatterboxes
in a haunted house? [chuckles]

25:24.291 --> 25:25.208
Atog.

25:27.041 --> 25:29.250
How long are you gonna be mad at me, huh?

25:29.833 --> 25:31.666
[man screams]
'Cause I don't have the money!

25:31.750 --> 25:34.291
Why didn't you tell me?
Wasn't it important?

25:34.375 --> 25:35.916
No, you stupid bitch!

25:36.000 --> 25:37.708
[woman] Oh, I'm the stupid bitch?

25:37.791 --> 25:39.541
-Those two.
-[woman] I could pay the bills!

25:39.625 --> 25:41.708
-Never gets old.
-[clattering]

25:42.750 --> 25:43.916
[woman] Come back here!

25:44.000 --> 25:46.833
-[car starts and drives away]
-Look, I'm sorry.

25:46.916 --> 25:49.375
Sometimes I just fuck up, but…

25:54.416 --> 25:56.208
Wanna go to your favorite store?

25:59.541 --> 26:01.291
Get some football cards…

26:03.250 --> 26:06.375
'Cause I'm gonna go
with or without you right now.

26:06.458 --> 26:08.083
Then it'll be me standing there

26:08.166 --> 26:10.583
staring at all those
cute men in tight pants.

26:10.666 --> 26:13.541
-Come on. [laughs]
-All right. Okay. [chuckles]

26:14.375 --> 26:16.583
-See ya next time.
-[man] Thanks, Steve.

26:16.666 --> 26:18.833
[rock music playing on stereo]

26:21.208 --> 26:22.333
Who you got?

26:22.416 --> 26:23.666
[chuckles]

26:26.791 --> 26:30.375
[Bev] You need to find a new favorite.
Joe Montana's not playing anymore.

26:30.458 --> 26:33.583
He's a four-time Super Bowl champion,
three-time MVP,

26:33.666 --> 26:36.875
All-Pro First Team three times
and 117 career wins.

26:36.958 --> 26:38.666
You sound like an automaton.

26:38.750 --> 26:40.583
40,551 career passing yards.

26:40.666 --> 26:42.041
-[chuckles] Okay.
-Yeah.

26:42.125 --> 26:44.500
-How'd you get so smart?
-I dunno.

26:44.583 --> 26:46.375
Who do you think it came from?

26:46.458 --> 26:47.458
[J.D. chuckles]

26:48.458 --> 26:50.958
-Sure.
-Me! It's true.

26:51.041 --> 26:52.791
-Okay.
-You remember that.

26:52.875 --> 26:55.916
-Whatever you say.
-Joe Montana has all of that.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.333
But who has the best touchdown dance, huh?

27:00.458 --> 27:01.791
Deion.

27:01.875 --> 27:03.000
-Mm-hmm.
-Of course.

27:04.041 --> 27:06.708
-Mom! Mom, stop!
-That's how it goes, right?

27:06.791 --> 27:09.250
-No! Not at all. It's like this.
-Okay.

27:11.208 --> 27:12.541
[Bev laughing]

27:15.833 --> 27:17.333
Hey, pick those up.

27:17.416 --> 27:20.041
-[Bev laughing]
-You shouldn't be dancing in the store.

27:20.125 --> 27:21.916
[mockingly] "Don't dance in the store."

27:22.000 --> 27:23.625
Pick those up now!

27:23.708 --> 27:24.708
He's doing it!

27:26.041 --> 27:27.375
Just… get out!

27:28.416 --> 27:31.000

He talks about police all the time.

28:06.291 --> 28:07.541
Well, he's a cop.

28:07.625 --> 28:10.958

still talk about other stuff, I guess.

28:18.291 --> 28:20.000

You'd have your own room,
and he's got a ping-pong table.

28:25.458 --> 28:27.166
That'd be good, right?

28:29.416 --> 28:31.166

28:32.125 --> 28:32.958
Why not?

28:34.375 --> 28:38.333

And then we'd have to find a new place.

-After everything that I do for you?

-For what?

40:02.750 --> 40:05.250
One of the moms
from Meghan's soccer team

40:05.333 --> 40:07.125
dumped this party on me last-minute.

40:07.208 --> 40:09.750
-[cell phone vibrating]
-We've got, like, five paper napkins

40:09.833 --> 40:11.416
and a half a pack of hot dogs.

40:12.250 --> 40:14.583
Sorry about this, Linds. Hello.

40:14.666 --> 40:16.375
-[woman] J.D. Vance?
-Yes?

40:16.458 --> 40:19.416
I'm calling from Phillip Roseman's office
at Glaston Hamburg.

40:19.500 --> 40:22.541
We'd like to invite you to
a final interview tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

40:22.625 --> 40:27.375
Uh, that's amazing. [chuckles]
Thank you so much. That's so great.

40:27.458 --> 40:28.750
But 10:00 a.m. tomorrow…

40:28.833 --> 40:31.500
Is there another time
Mr. Roseman can meet me?

40:31.583 --> 40:33.833
I'm a ten-hour drive away from New Haven.

40:34.750 --> 40:36.125
[woman] I'm afraid not.

40:36.208 --> 40:38.750
Mr. Roseman's only in New Haven
for one more day.

40:39.916 --> 40:44.916
Okay, 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.
Uh, thank you. Bye.

40:47.083 --> 40:49.458
-What?
-Summer internship.

40:49.541 --> 40:52.500
My final interview's tomorrow.
It's the only one I got.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.916
-I gotta be there.
-One day?

40:56.458 --> 40:58.333
-Short visit.
-Yeah.

40:58.416 --> 41:01.916
Yeah, just about a day too long.
Heroin, Lindsay? Jesus.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.750
When did she go off a cliff?

41:04.500 --> 41:07.333
-Dad?
-[J.D. banging on door] Papaw!

41:07.916 --> 41:09.875
-[Bev] Do you hear anything?
-[J.D.] No!

41:09.958 --> 41:11.375
-[Mamaw] I can see him!
-I see him!

41:11.458 --> 41:14.291
He got the TV on too loud.
I'm breaking it.

41:14.375 --> 41:15.958
-What?
-I'm breaking it.

41:16.833 --> 41:18.875
[J.D.] Just move!

41:22.750 --> 41:24.750
[Bev banging on door]
J.D.! Unlock the door!

41:26.833 --> 41:28.958
Dad! Dad!

41:29.583 --> 41:31.541
-Oh, my God. Call an ambulance.
-[Bev] Dad?

41:33.625 --> 41:34.583
[Mamaw] Call!

41:38.750 --> 41:41.041
-It's too late.
-How do you know?

41:41.125 --> 41:44.625
'Cause I'm a nurse, Mom.
I know. He's dead.

41:45.875 --> 41:46.958
[Bev sobbing]

41:55.208 --> 41:58.958
[Bev] No, it's not an emergency.
We just need a coroner.

42:01.416 --> 42:02.583
Yeah, I'm sure.

42:10.125 --> 42:11.125
Jimmy…

42:14.958 --> 42:16.083
[Mamaw sobbing]

42:21.958 --> 42:25.333
[somber fiddle music playing]

43:00.833 --> 43:03.500
[thunder rumbling]

43:11.166 --> 43:12.791
Why do they do that, Mamaw?

43:14.125 --> 43:18.541
'Cause we're hill people, honey.
We respect our dead.

43:33.166 --> 43:35.541
[J.D.] I didn't know
till after he was gone

43:35.625 --> 43:38.291
how Papaw had protected my mom
from the world.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.416
Now the only person
who ever got her was gone.

43:44.958 --> 43:47.458
Whatever dreams she or any of us had…

43:49.583 --> 43:51.875
they all just seemed
that much further away.

43:54.333 --> 43:56.000
Hey, you all right, babe?

43:56.083 --> 43:57.625
[Bev] Matt, I'm fine.

44:05.125 --> 44:06.416
[Mamaw sobbing]

44:31.291 --> 44:32.666
[Mamaw continues sobbing]

44:37.125 --> 44:39.625
-[woman] Is this going to hurt?
-[Bev] I already did it.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.250
I give you the special treatment, Janice.
You know that.

44:44.333 --> 44:45.875
That other one sure don't.

44:45.958 --> 44:49.458
[laughs] Kit? She's new, she'll learn.

44:51.583 --> 44:55.000
-Can I get you anything else?
-No, I'm good.

44:55.083 --> 44:57.500
-[Bev] All right. Here.
-[woman] Thank you.

45:20.541 --> 45:22.666
You're back. How was the funeral?

45:23.208 --> 45:25.625
Oh, you know, same old family bullshit.

45:31.416 --> 45:32.833
Oh, my God, are those yours?

45:33.375 --> 45:36.041
Mm. I go after work.
The parking lot is perfect for it.

45:36.125 --> 45:38.375
Oh, my God, I used to…

45:40.000 --> 45:44.458
-Can I try 'em? What size are they?
-[Katrina] Um, they're a seven.

45:44.541 --> 45:45.375
[Bev] Wow.

45:45.458 --> 45:47.791
-[Katrina] Do they fit?
-Like a glove.

45:48.416 --> 45:49.416
[Bev laughs]

45:50.041 --> 45:51.041
Wow.

45:51.125 --> 45:53.916
I used to love these.
You know, the roller rink.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.916
-Yeah, and go on dates?
-[chuckles] Oh, I was so hot.

45:58.791 --> 46:02.041
I went dancing and everything.
Can I try them out?

46:03.083 --> 46:05.333
-Where're you gonna go?
-[laughing]

46:07.250 --> 46:08.416
Sorry!

46:09.666 --> 46:13.916
♪ Hot summer streets
And the pavements are burning ♪

46:14.000 --> 46:15.708

46:18.541 --> 46:23.375

So I got to get up and go… ♪

46:29.166 --> 46:30.416

-Whoa, whoa, whoa. [laughing]

46:33.041 --> 46:35.791
-Somebody call security!
-Security!

46:38.541 --> 46:40.083
So what did they do?

46:40.166 --> 46:42.708
They fired my ass.
What do you think they did?

46:42.791 --> 46:45.791
-Oh, Beverly!
-[Bev] I was sick of that place anyway.

46:45.875 --> 46:48.583
Gainful employment was cramping her style.

46:48.666 --> 46:50.000
[Bev] I will get another job.

46:50.083 --> 46:52.000
You could lose your fucking license.

46:52.916 --> 46:53.916
What are you doing?

46:54.000 --> 46:55.458
[Bev] I got a headache. I need a--

46:55.541 --> 46:59.625
[Mamaw] You can't have a goddamn hissy
every time you have an off day.

46:59.708 --> 47:01.375
You gotta think about these kids.

47:01.458 --> 47:05.041
What do you think I've been thinking about
since I was 18 years old, huh?

47:05.125 --> 47:08.166
Never had a life
where I wasn't thinking about the kids.

47:09.375 --> 47:10.708
It's all about us.

47:12.458 --> 47:16.125
-[Mamaw] So what are you gonna do?
-Figure something out.

47:16.208 --> 47:17.625
Great plan, Mom.

47:21.500 --> 47:25.083
It isn't easy, all right?
Just wait till you get pregnant.

47:25.166 --> 47:26.583
I'm not having a kid.

47:26.666 --> 47:30.000
You think you're special?
That's what happens to girls.

47:30.083 --> 47:31.708
Only girls that are stupid.

47:32.791 --> 47:34.625
-Beverly!
-[Bev] You wanna call me stupid?

47:34.708 --> 47:36.583
-Little bitch!
-[Lindsay] I'm going to Kevin's!

47:36.666 --> 47:39.291
[Bev] It's easy when someone else
is paying the bills!

47:39.375 --> 47:42.583
-[Lindsay] I'm smarter than you!
-[Bev] You gotta respect your mother!

47:47.500 --> 47:51.041
Can I put on Meet the Press?
There's a special about Monica Lewinsky.

47:51.125 --> 47:54.041
[sniffles] I don't want
to hear any more of that filth.

47:54.125 --> 47:56.166
-What's the name of this game?
-Son of a bitch!

47:56.250 --> 47:57.916
[chuckles] Watch your mouth. Gin.

47:58.500 --> 48:00.125
-[Mamaw chuckles]
-I never win.

48:00.958 --> 48:05.041
Well, if you don't like it,
find some lame-ass loser to play with.

48:05.125 --> 48:06.541
[laughs]

48:07.166 --> 48:08.333
Deal.

You are the worst fucking card player
I ever met.

Hasta la vista, baby.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.916
-How many times you've seen this movie?
-Oh, about a hundred.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.416
Why do you keep watching it?

48:44.000 --> 48:46.458
Like it, I figure.

48:46.541 --> 48:49.333
Everyone in this world
is one of three kinds:

48:49.416 --> 48:53.750
a good Terminator,
a bad Terminator, and neutral.

48:53.833 --> 48:55.375
You're a good Terminator.

48:55.458 --> 48:58.583
Well, wasn't always. I had to learn.

48:58.666 --> 48:59.666
[sighs]

49:00.375 --> 49:03.291
You could be, too,
if you don't fuck it up.

49:04.208 --> 49:05.208
You're like me.

49:07.291 --> 49:08.291
Is Mom like you?

49:08.875 --> 49:11.166
She and Papaw were more the same.

49:11.250 --> 49:13.208
He was a good Terminator.

49:14.083 --> 49:17.041
[sighs] At times, he could be the bad one.

49:18.083 --> 49:21.000
Why do you think
he was living down the street there?

49:21.083 --> 49:22.541
How was he bad?

49:24.291 --> 49:28.291
He let things get to him,
make him feel small.

49:29.791 --> 49:30.958
Could I be bad?

49:31.541 --> 49:33.083

Calm down, we just need you to breathe.

-He's my dad!

50:43.875 --> 50:45.958
Hey! Hey!

Stand back!

-[Mamaw] J.D.!
-[Bev] No!

51:08.625 --> 51:11.333
Don't look at that! Come on!
Don't you look at…

51:11.416 --> 51:12.541
-You look at me!
-Okay.

51:12.625 --> 51:14.250
You look at me! All right?

51:14.333 --> 51:16.458
Lindsay, honey!
Come back down to my house!

51:16.541 --> 51:18.166
-[officer 2] You need to calm down.
-No!

51:18.250 --> 51:20.541
-[officer 1] Calm down!
-[Lindsay] Help her!

51:34.791 --> 51:37.458
Yes, I'm looking for a bed for my mother.

51:39.875 --> 51:42.125
No, she doesn't have insurance. But, um…

51:44.250 --> 51:46.083
No? Okay. Thanks.

51:47.375 --> 51:48.333
Shit.

51:58.375 --> 52:01.125
Oh, my God.
Is that a fried baloney sandwich?

52:01.208 --> 52:03.125
-[chuckles]
-My savior.

52:03.208 --> 52:05.958
-[laughing]
-Come on, Linds. Seriously. I need this.

52:06.541 --> 52:09.583
-Give me the damn sandwich.
-I saved you the last slice.

52:09.666 --> 52:12.125
I figured they don't have that at Yale.

52:13.208 --> 52:16.625
I think this might be outlawed at Yale.
My God.

52:17.833 --> 52:19.125
I miss this.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.541
There they are. Oh, look at you, huh?

52:23.625 --> 52:26.125
Keep it down! He's talking to Yale! Ooh!

52:26.208 --> 52:28.291
I ain't seen you
since your Mamaw's funeral.

52:28.375 --> 52:30.250
-[J.D.] Been that long?
-Hey, Linds.

52:30.333 --> 52:32.125
-Was she a holy terror.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

52:32.208 --> 52:33.583
-You got the beer.
-Yes, I do.

52:33.666 --> 52:35.000
[Lindsay] Did you get the buns?

52:35.541 --> 52:37.375
Uh… I…

52:37.458 --> 52:40.791
Well, enjoy your bunless dogs then.

52:40.875 --> 52:42.458
-I will.
-[Cheryl] Nice.

52:42.541 --> 52:43.458
[chuckles]

52:44.833 --> 52:46.416
So what are you doing here, man?

52:46.500 --> 52:48.791
Taking care of my mother,
dealing with all that.

52:48.875 --> 52:50.916
[Louis] I was there
when Lindsay brought her in.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.375
-I'm sorry.
-[J.D.] I was trying to find her a rehab.

52:53.458 --> 52:56.041
-Whatever you do, don't go to Cedar Creek.
-Trade ya.

52:56.125 --> 52:57.583
[J.D.] Why? What's with Cedar Creek?

52:57.666 --> 53:00.541
-Cedar Creek? Food's shit.
-[Louis] My brother-in-law was there.

53:00.625 --> 53:02.291
-What's that one…
-[Louis] Got bed mites.

53:02.375 --> 53:05.166
Get her into Fairlawn. It's like a resort.

53:05.250 --> 53:08.458
They don't have beds.
Plus, we can't afford that shit.

53:08.541 --> 53:10.333
-Hey, honey!
-Yeah?

53:10.416 --> 53:13.333
Doesn't your friend Sally
work over at that rehab…

53:13.416 --> 53:14.375
New Beginnings.

53:14.458 --> 53:17.750
-Call and see if they got anything open.
-[Cheryl] Sure.

53:18.333 --> 53:20.125
Can you believe someone married this guy?

53:20.208 --> 53:22.541
Hell no. You kidding me?
You blindfold her?

53:22.625 --> 53:25.583
Yeah, I blindfolded her.
That's what I did.

Anything?

53:33.500 --> 53:36.041

53:39.708 --> 53:41.625
[cell phone vibrating]

53:44.791 --> 53:46.375
Have you even talked to her?

53:47.208 --> 53:49.500
I just don't want to drag her into it,
you know?

53:50.083 --> 53:52.083
-You don't think she's in it?
-[cell phone clicks]

53:57.750 --> 54:02.625
-Don't be an asshole. Let her decide.
-[scoffs]

54:03.791 --> 54:04.625
Damn.

54:06.125 --> 54:08.375
But Parker has taken it a step further

54:08.458 --> 54:11.041
-to say judges are inherently political…
-[cell phone vibrates]

54:11.125 --> 54:12.666
…which isn't necessarily true.

54:12.750 --> 54:14.375
-Be right back.
-Usha's right.

54:14.458 --> 54:15.875
-Hey.
-[J.D.] Hey.

54:16.458 --> 54:20.250
-Did you make it home all right?
-Yeah, sorry I didn't call sooner.

54:20.333 --> 54:22.458
I've just been
dealing with all this stuff.

54:22.541 --> 54:24.583
Um, is your mom okay?

54:24.666 --> 54:26.916
It's hard to tell, honestly,

54:27.000 --> 54:29.791
but the hospital's
kicking her out at 3:00 p.m.

54:29.875 --> 54:33.500
and, uh, we're having a bitch of a time
finding her a rehab so…

54:35.333 --> 54:38.458
But, uh… Oh! [chuckles]
Guess what?

54:38.541 --> 54:39.375
[Usha] What?

54:40.125 --> 54:43.583
I got a call from Glaston Hamburg.

54:43.666 --> 54:46.083
You did? For a final interview?

54:46.166 --> 54:48.166
-Yeah, uh, with Phillip Roseman…
-Yes!

54:48.250 --> 54:50.958
-…tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.
-That's incredible, J.D.

54:51.041 --> 54:52.791
Yeah, if I can make it.

54:53.291 --> 54:54.666
Listen. Let me come.

54:54.750 --> 54:57.208
I can stay with your mom
and you come back and interview.

54:57.291 --> 54:58.500
Usha, I appreciate it.

54:58.583 --> 55:01.166
But you'd have no idea
what you'd be walking into.

55:01.250 --> 55:04.250
I've been in hospitals before,
when my grandmother was sick.

55:04.333 --> 55:06.583
It's not the fucking flu, Usha!

55:07.541 --> 55:10.708
Okay? My mom overdosed on heroin.

55:12.416 --> 55:14.625
-What?
-Is that the kind of problem you want?

55:18.208 --> 55:19.333
I didn't think so.

55:26.500 --> 55:30.500
Look, I gotta get back
and deal with all this stuff. Bye.

55:41.125 --> 55:42.333
-[Lindsay] J.D.!
-Yeah?

55:43.291 --> 55:44.416
[Lindsay] Come here.

55:48.791 --> 55:53.750
The guy said, "Objectivity doesn't exist
and legal interpretation is subjective."

55:53.833 --> 55:57.833
Exactly. What does that mean?
We can't trust the judicial system?

56:13.083 --> 56:16.541
Cheryl thinks they might have space.
Let's go.

56:16.625 --> 56:17.916
Talk to Sally Coates.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.958
She said there was a spot
that was spoken for, but go on down.

56:21.041 --> 56:23.541
-Thank you, Cheryl.
-Yeah. You're welcome.

56:23.625 --> 56:25.166
Mom, where are my cleats?

56:25.250 --> 56:28.875
Check under your bed, honey.
Get me outta here.

56:31.125 --> 56:34.166
-So you're a soccer mom.
-Such a fake.

56:34.250 --> 56:37.541
I don't know.
I think I got you out-faked by a mile.

56:37.625 --> 56:38.625
[laughs]

56:40.166 --> 56:41.708
You really think rehab…

56:42.791 --> 56:43.791
What?

56:43.875 --> 56:45.583
Think it'll do any good this time?

56:48.416 --> 56:50.666
[indistinct arguing]

56:55.375 --> 56:56.416
You miss me?

56:57.666 --> 56:58.500
Yeah.

57:00.333 --> 57:01.333
[Bev] Is Lindsay around?

57:01.416 --> 57:04.500
Not spending all her time
with Prince Charming? [chuckles]

57:04.583 --> 57:05.875
You know how it is.

57:13.291 --> 57:14.333
I, uh…

57:15.500 --> 57:17.708
-I brought you this.
-What's this?

57:18.791 --> 57:21.625
Some stuff for you to do
while you're in here

57:21.708 --> 57:23.000
so you don't get bored.

57:23.666 --> 57:28.208
It's got funny jokes and math problems
and some Bible stuff, too.

57:28.791 --> 57:29.916
I made it.

57:30.958 --> 57:32.166
[chuckles]

57:43.083 --> 57:44.166
I love you.

57:46.583 --> 57:49.791
When I get out of here,
I'm going to make a real home for us.

57:50.708 --> 57:51.541
Okay?

57:52.083 --> 57:55.708
You gotta help me do more cooking
and all that healthy stuff, okay?

57:59.083 --> 58:00.791
It's gonna be different now.

58:06.416 --> 58:10.208
[receptionist] New Beginnings.
How may I direct your call?

58:10.291 --> 58:11.291
-Hi.
-[woman] Hi.

58:11.375 --> 58:14.666
We're here to visit
my son Victor. Victor Boyd.

58:14.750 --> 58:17.041
Oh, of course. Please have a seat.

58:18.791 --> 58:19.708
Hi, sir. Yes?

58:19.791 --> 58:23.041
Hello. I'm J.D. Vance.
I'm here to see Sally Coates.

58:25.208 --> 58:28.291
[Sally] To be honest with you,
I know you and Cheryl go back,

58:28.375 --> 58:32.625
I'd love to help, but there's a procedure
to getting on the wait list--

58:32.708 --> 58:33.916
Ma'am, I understand.

58:34.000 --> 58:38.791
Okay, but my mom's had a really tough time
since Mamaw died a few years back.

58:39.375 --> 58:41.125
I wish I could help. It's just--

58:41.208 --> 58:43.833
I respect your need to follow procedure.

58:44.500 --> 58:46.000
I know she messed up.

58:46.625 --> 58:48.541
And she's had a history of it,

58:48.625 --> 58:51.791
but she also has a history
of being a pretty good person.

58:55.000 --> 58:55.916
[sighs]

58:56.000 --> 58:59.375
She put herself through
nursing school as a single mother,

58:59.958 --> 59:01.833
and now I'm at law school.

59:02.708 --> 59:05.958
I just… I really…
Ma'am, I really think that…

59:07.750 --> 59:10.666
if my mom had somebody to believe in her…

59:12.000 --> 59:15.166
You need to understand
that I can't leave here.

59:15.750 --> 59:18.916
I can't until I've done
everything humanly possible.

59:20.833 --> 59:22.333
All right? This is my family.

59:23.791 --> 59:27.958
So until you drag me out of here,
I'm gonna keep giving you reasons.

59:31.083 --> 59:33.416
[man over PA] Jason Flip,
please report to the Group Room.

59:33.500 --> 59:36.166
Jason Flip, to the group room please.
Thank you.

59:40.583 --> 59:43.166
-Glad I was able to help.
-Thank you so much.

59:44.333 --> 59:45.541
Good, Linds.

59:48.500 --> 59:50.541
Okay, uh, bear with me here.

59:50.625 --> 59:51.958
[receptionist scoffs]

59:52.041 --> 59:56.583
Five hundred on this one
and a thousand on this one.

59:56.666 --> 1:00:00.208
Sorry. Five hundred on this one
and a thousand on this one.

1:00:00.291 --> 1:00:01.208
This one?

1:00:01.291 --> 1:00:04.625
[receptionist] We'll authorize it now,
but it won't charge till she's admitted.

1:00:06.958 --> 1:00:08.291
[Lindsay] Yup. Okay.

1:00:08.375 --> 1:00:10.041
[J.D.] That should be for the first week.

1:00:10.125 --> 1:00:11.208
Pick me up here.

1:00:11.291 --> 1:00:14.208
I need payment
for the first two weeks to check her in.

1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:16.458
Okay. Um…

1:00:18.625 --> 1:00:21.333
Okay, put 500 more on this one

1:00:21.416 --> 1:00:24.541
and, uh… 1,000 on that one.

1:00:24.625 --> 1:00:28.333
And that should be… good.
Let me know if those all go through.

1:00:29.416 --> 1:00:30.625
Sorry about this.

1:00:31.666 --> 1:00:32.875
[receptionist] Last one.

1:00:37.166 --> 1:00:38.250
Okay, you're good.

1:00:38.833 --> 1:00:40.375
-Are you serious?
-I am! [chuckles]

1:00:40.458 --> 1:00:42.041
Okay, perfect. Thank you.

1:00:42.125 --> 1:00:43.208
That's done.

1:00:43.291 --> 1:00:45.250
Amazing. I'll come back and sign those.

1:00:45.333 --> 1:00:47.791
-I'll let my mom know what's going on.
-Yes, sir.

1:00:49.541 --> 1:00:51.833
Okay, uh, you're good to go.

1:00:51.916 --> 1:00:55.083
Once the doctor and the therapist
do their assessment of you.

1:00:55.166 --> 1:00:57.541
-No, thanks.
-[J.D.] What are you talking about?

1:00:58.041 --> 1:00:59.000
I changed my mind.

1:00:59.083 --> 1:01:00.708
-Where are you going?
-What?

1:01:00.791 --> 1:01:04.125
-I begged them to let you stay here.
-Nobody asked you to.

1:01:05.041 --> 1:01:07.375
-I'm not a charity case.
-Why am I here, Mom?

1:01:08.125 --> 1:01:11.375
-Feel superior maybe?
-[J.D.] How can you be so fucking selfish?

1:01:11.458 --> 1:01:13.875
-You even care what you do to Lindsay?
-J.D., shut up.

1:01:13.958 --> 1:01:16.708
-Leave her out of this!
-You did the same thing to Mamaw.

1:01:16.791 --> 1:01:20.291
You just took and took from her
until she was practically bankrupt.

1:01:20.375 --> 1:01:23.791
-Yeah, she was a goddamn saint.
-All she ever did was bail you out!

1:01:23.875 --> 1:01:25.541
Except when it mattered!

1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:30.000
Do you actually want to be dead?
Or you just too lazy to try?

1:01:30.083 --> 1:01:32.541
-[Lindsay] J.D.! Don't!
-Oh, I tried… plenty!

1:01:39.708 --> 1:01:41.583
-[J.D.] I'm done with her.
-Don't be stupid.

1:01:41.666 --> 1:01:44.666
We can't leave her here.
She's got no place to go.

1:01:44.750 --> 1:01:46.583
-You keep defending her.
-I'm not!

1:01:46.666 --> 1:01:49.791
She was worse to you than anybody.
Now she's making you feel guilty.

1:01:49.875 --> 1:01:51.333
Just like she did with Mamaw.

1:01:54.375 --> 1:01:56.208
You don't know everything, J.D.

1:01:56.291 --> 1:01:59.208
She's been doing this
since we were kids, Lindsay. Come on.

1:02:00.125 --> 1:02:02.833
Well, it didn't start with her.

1:02:04.791 --> 1:02:08.750
Mom and Aunt Lori,
they had it worse than us.

1:02:09.541 --> 1:02:11.250
It was a war in that house.

1:02:12.416 --> 1:02:14.916
[Mamaw] Beverly, hide your sister
in the closet! Go on!

1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.125
-[Papaw] Shut up!
-[Mamaw] What kinda man are you?

1:02:17.208 --> 1:02:21.125
You come home drunk one more time,
I'm gonna light your ass on fire!

1:02:21.208 --> 1:02:23.791
[Papaw] I'll come home
whenever I goddamn please!

1:02:23.875 --> 1:02:26.750
[Mamaw] Get out, you drunk asshole!
[groans]

1:02:26.833 --> 1:02:28.875
-Shut your mouth! See what happens!
-[Mamaw] Stop!

1:02:28.958 --> 1:02:30.708
Stop it! Get out!

1:02:32.166 --> 1:02:35.875
You goddamn son of a bitch.
You're lying there in your own piss!

1:02:36.583 --> 1:02:38.750
I told you what I was gonna do!

1:02:39.916 --> 1:02:43.375
-[gasps]
-[Papaw screaming in pain]

1:02:43.458 --> 1:02:44.833
[Mamaw] This is your own doing!

1:02:45.625 --> 1:02:47.291
You're no goddamn father!

1:02:48.875 --> 1:02:50.291
[Papaw continues screaming]

1:03:14.541 --> 1:03:16.208
I can't defend her…

1:03:17.291 --> 1:03:19.500
but I'm trying to forgive her.

1:03:22.625 --> 1:03:26.791
If you don't, you're never gonna get out
of what you're trying to get out of.

1:04:01.583 --> 1:04:02.583
[J.D. sighs]

1:04:10.875 --> 1:04:12.125
Mom, this is…

1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:16.208
This is my girlfriend. This is Usha.

1:04:21.958 --> 1:04:23.166
What is she?

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:26.125
She's Indian.

1:04:27.250 --> 1:04:28.250
[chuckles]

1:04:28.833 --> 1:04:30.375
Well, she's really pretty.

1:04:30.875 --> 1:04:32.625
I think you'd like her a lot.

1:04:32.708 --> 1:04:34.333
You should bring her here.

1:04:39.833 --> 1:04:41.750
I've been doing real good.

1:04:42.583 --> 1:04:46.000
I've been working,
trying to get my license back. I…

1:04:48.958 --> 1:04:50.625
I just had a down…

1:04:52.083 --> 1:04:53.666
you know, month.

1:04:53.750 --> 1:04:55.666
[breath trembling]

1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:06.958
I got an interview tomorrow, Mom.

1:05:07.041 --> 1:05:08.458
-Otherwise, I'd--
-Yeah.

1:05:10.041 --> 1:05:11.250
[Bev sniffles]

1:05:12.666 --> 1:05:14.416
You sure you don't wanna stay here?

1:05:14.500 --> 1:05:16.000
-I got you the bed.
-Oh, no.

1:05:17.083 --> 1:05:18.708
Just take me to Ray's.

1:05:18.791 --> 1:05:21.375
-Mom, come on.
-Oh, you know me.

1:05:22.083 --> 1:05:23.750
I always land on my feet.

1:05:29.041 --> 1:05:32.416
Congratulate me, why don't you?
I'm a married woman.

1:05:32.500 --> 1:05:34.000
You're getting married?

1:05:34.083 --> 1:05:36.958
I got married. [laughs]

1:05:37.666 --> 1:05:38.666
Well?

1:05:39.625 --> 1:05:41.375
Aren't you happy for me? Hello?

1:05:42.041 --> 1:05:44.041
Why didn't you tell anybody?

1:05:44.125 --> 1:05:47.291
-I thought you two were gonna break up.
-I didn't marry Matt.

1:05:47.375 --> 1:05:48.500
I married Ken.

1:05:48.583 --> 1:05:49.666
What?

1:05:49.750 --> 1:05:51.083
Who the hell's Ken?

1:05:51.166 --> 1:05:53.916
My boss at the dialysis center.

1:05:54.458 --> 1:05:57.500
Ugh. Kiss my ruby-red asshole.
When'd all this happen?

1:05:57.583 --> 1:05:58.791
[Bev] It's been going on.

1:05:58.875 --> 1:06:01.750
Anyway, it's been over
with Matt for a while.

1:06:01.833 --> 1:06:03.291
It's over with Matt?

1:06:03.375 --> 1:06:06.250
Well, obviously. I married somebody else.

1:06:09.500 --> 1:06:10.583
[chair thuds]

1:06:12.375 --> 1:06:14.958
[pop song playing in distance]

1:06:22.541 --> 1:06:25.875
This is a kitchen with kitchen stuff.

1:06:27.541 --> 1:06:28.583
And…

1:06:29.666 --> 1:06:32.583
this was a kegerator when we moved in.

1:06:33.083 --> 1:06:35.375
Yeah, I wanted to keep it, but… [chuckles]

1:06:35.458 --> 1:06:37.416
We keep sodas there now.

1:06:41.458 --> 1:06:43.541
Hey, I'm sorry about your dog.

1:06:44.208 --> 1:06:47.000
You know, I can't breathe.
It's the dander.

1:06:48.291 --> 1:06:50.291
Hey, let me show you your room.

1:06:50.875 --> 1:06:51.916
Over here.

1:06:56.833 --> 1:06:57.958
This is Travis.

1:06:58.041 --> 1:07:00.041
Uh, Travis, this is J.D.

1:07:00.541 --> 1:07:02.791
[video game playing]

1:07:03.541 --> 1:07:04.750
[Ken] Settle in.

1:07:16.541 --> 1:07:17.958
[Travis] You wanna see something?

1:07:19.500 --> 1:07:22.750
My dad smokes all the time.
He doesn't know I take it.

1:07:24.208 --> 1:07:26.500
He keeps it in here.

1:07:29.375 --> 1:07:30.291
Wanna get high?

1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:38.458
What? You never smoked?

1:07:39.083 --> 1:07:40.375
[J.D.] It's a gateway drug.

1:07:40.875 --> 1:07:42.916
-My mom's in recovery--
-Chickenshit!

1:07:44.250 --> 1:07:46.416
What do they do where you come from, hmm?

1:07:47.166 --> 1:07:48.958
-Whippits?
-No.

1:07:50.708 --> 1:07:52.958
[Travis] Come on! It's no big deal.

1:07:53.041 --> 1:07:55.708
-You gotta loosen up a bit, man.
-I, uh…

1:07:55.791 --> 1:07:58.166
[Travis] You just gotta go for it.
Come on.

1:07:58.250 --> 1:07:59.125
[J.D.] I gotta go.

1:07:59.208 --> 1:08:01.083
-Maybe next time.
-Pussy!

1:08:13.125 --> 1:08:17.083
I'm Joie Chen. Coming up, reaction to
our interview with Iran's new president.

1:08:17.166 --> 1:08:19.916
-[Bev] J.D., I've been looking for you.
-[door closes]

1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:21.625
I need you to piss in this.

1:08:22.208 --> 1:08:26.083
I got a call from the nursing board.
I have to give them a sample today.

1:08:26.166 --> 1:08:27.583
-A sample?
-Clean piss.

1:08:27.666 --> 1:08:30.333
Mamaw's got
100 prescriptions in hers, so--

1:08:30.416 --> 1:08:31.500
Why isn't yours clean?

1:08:33.166 --> 1:08:34.666
Just do it. Okay?

1:08:34.750 --> 1:08:37.541
-Why isn't yours clean?
-Come on now. Go do it!

1:08:37.625 --> 1:08:39.583
-No!
-Please!

1:08:44.416 --> 1:08:45.250
[Bev] Look…

1:08:47.500 --> 1:08:49.500
[voice breaks] I know that I messed up.

1:08:51.791 --> 1:08:55.500
I've been trying
really hard with Ken, but it just…

1:08:57.083 --> 1:09:01.250
It isn't easy, and…
I promise that I'm gonna do better,

1:09:01.333 --> 1:09:02.750
but I can't lose my job.

1:09:02.833 --> 1:09:06.333
-You should've thought of that before.
-I know. I really need this.

1:09:06.416 --> 1:09:08.916
No! If you want clean piss,
stop fucking up your life

1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:10.583
and get it from your own bladder!

1:09:10.666 --> 1:09:12.416
What is going on down here?

1:09:12.500 --> 1:09:14.916
She wants my piss because hers is dirty.

1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:16.708
It's for the nursing board!

1:09:23.625 --> 1:09:25.333
[breathes deeply]

1:09:39.333 --> 1:09:41.791
J.D., you need to help your mama on this.

1:09:44.916 --> 1:09:48.666
You let her get away with this every time.
How is she gonna learn?

1:09:48.750 --> 1:09:50.291
I told you I would do better.

1:09:50.375 --> 1:09:52.875
-You always say that! You're lying!
-I always try!

1:09:52.958 --> 1:09:53.833
J.D.--

1:09:53.916 --> 1:09:57.791
If you'd put your foot down years ago,
she wouldn't be like this! She wouldn't!

1:09:57.875 --> 1:10:00.875
You're a shitty mom and so are you!

1:10:00.958 --> 1:10:01.958
[J.D. sniffles]

1:10:06.125 --> 1:10:08.916
[loud slamming]

1:10:09.708 --> 1:10:13.708
[ball slamming]

1:10:17.791 --> 1:10:19.291
-[Mamaw] J.D.
-What?

1:10:21.416 --> 1:10:24.041
[Mamaw] You may be right
about some of what you said.

1:10:25.750 --> 1:10:29.000
But things haven't exactly
worked out for your mama.

1:10:29.083 --> 1:10:30.583
[panting]

1:10:31.916 --> 1:10:34.041
We can't let them take her license.

1:10:34.125 --> 1:10:36.916
Why? It's her own stupid fault.

1:10:38.166 --> 1:10:41.833
I know this ain't right, honey,
but she's your mother.

1:10:42.416 --> 1:10:45.541
And maybe
if we help her this one last time,

1:10:45.625 --> 1:10:48.791
she'll finally
learn her lesson and keep her job.

1:10:48.875 --> 1:10:51.083
Why can't we let her
clean her own mess up?

1:10:51.166 --> 1:10:55.166
'Cause family is the only thing
that means a goddamn.

1:10:57.583 --> 1:10:58.791
You'll learn that.

1:11:04.166 --> 1:11:05.750
Mamaw, I wanna stay with you.

1:11:08.166 --> 1:11:09.333
Can I stay?

1:11:11.208 --> 1:11:13.916
Can't do that.
We're not gonna do that to her.

1:11:15.666 --> 1:11:17.416
But you always got me.

1:11:19.500 --> 1:11:20.458
Now…

1:11:21.875 --> 1:11:23.250
do this for her.

1:11:29.625 --> 1:11:32.208
[door opens, closes]

1:11:51.583 --> 1:11:54.291
[train horn blaring]

1:12:01.958 --> 1:12:02.916
Mamaw!

1:12:06.208 --> 1:12:07.083
Mamaw!

1:12:12.916 --> 1:12:14.166
Mamaw!

1:12:18.791 --> 1:12:20.541
-[Mamaw coughs]
-Mamaw!

1:12:21.291 --> 1:12:24.041
-[wheezing]
-Are you okay? Say something!

1:12:24.541 --> 1:12:25.833
[J.D. cries] Oh, no!

1:12:27.166 --> 1:12:28.083
Shit!

1:12:37.375 --> 1:12:39.375
-Mamaw?
-Hmm.

1:12:45.458 --> 1:12:46.541
Are you gonna die?

1:12:48.875 --> 1:12:52.500
-What the hell are you asking me that for?
-They said you have pneumonia.

1:12:53.416 --> 1:12:55.208
People can die from pneumonia.

1:12:55.291 --> 1:12:58.291
-Are you trying to kill me off?
-I know you know.

1:12:59.166 --> 1:13:00.083
People know.

1:13:00.166 --> 1:13:04.208
What kind of feather-brained idea is that?
Who knows they're gonna die?

1:13:04.291 --> 1:13:07.916
People do. Like… Native Americans.

1:13:08.416 --> 1:13:12.291
They're called "Indians."
Like the Cleveland Indians,

1:13:12.375 --> 1:13:14.916
and they don't know
more than other people.

1:13:15.916 --> 1:13:18.958
They're not magic
just 'cause they don't have microwaves.

1:13:19.041 --> 1:13:20.333
Just tell me!

1:13:20.916 --> 1:13:23.375
-I don't know.
-Are you gonna die now?

1:13:23.458 --> 1:13:24.916
You mean right now?

1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:28.416
[sighs] Are you gonna come home
from this hospital?

1:13:28.500 --> 1:13:32.416
I just told you, I don't goddamn know.

1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.583
Fine. Just go ahead and die.

1:13:35.666 --> 1:13:37.458
Oh, J.D.

1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:43.250
You might think
that algebra is jail, but it's not.

1:13:43.833 --> 1:13:47.083
It's freedom. Boil it down.

1:13:47.166 --> 1:13:50.166
Balance. If it's good on the left,
it's good on the right.

1:13:50.750 --> 1:13:53.791
-Boil it down. B-I-D.
-[bell rings]

1:13:53.875 --> 1:13:57.583
All right, next week, quadratic equations.
Bum-bum-bum.

1:13:58.166 --> 1:14:01.375
We'll be putting
those graphing calculators to use, so,

1:14:01.458 --> 1:14:03.791
if you don't have one, go get one.

1:14:04.625 --> 1:14:05.708
J.D.

1:14:10.666 --> 1:14:13.250
You're gonna need
a parent's signature on that.

1:14:16.958 --> 1:14:19.083
You're gonna fail if you keep this up.

1:14:20.333 --> 1:14:22.000
I think you're smarter than that.

1:14:35.500 --> 1:14:38.375
["Metal on Metal" playing]

1:14:44.416 --> 1:14:46.791
-[Travis] Do it, man!
-[Doug] That's it. Under the shirt.

1:14:46.875 --> 1:14:48.916
-Breathe in. There you go.
-[Travis] Oh!

1:14:49.416 --> 1:14:52.500
-[Doug] Stand up.
-No!

1:14:52.583 --> 1:14:54.333
All right, one foot. One foot.

1:14:54.416 --> 1:14:56.250
[all] One foot, one foot, one foot.

1:14:56.333 --> 1:14:58.541
-[Doug] There you go.
-[Louis] Oh, shit!

1:15:00.208 --> 1:15:01.666
[Frank] Hey, check it out.

1:15:11.041 --> 1:15:12.500
Aren't you gonna work, man?

1:15:13.166 --> 1:15:16.333
[scoffs] Nah, dude. I quit.

1:15:17.291 --> 1:15:18.291
[Travis] Why?

1:15:19.708 --> 1:15:23.250
They fired Cheyenne. Said she
missed too many days or some shit.

1:15:23.333 --> 1:15:24.625
[Frank] There you go, Pee-Wee.

1:15:24.708 --> 1:15:29.208
It was all 'cause she was puking, mostly,
but that was just the first three months.

1:15:29.291 --> 1:15:31.000
Three months of what? [chuckles]

1:15:31.083 --> 1:15:32.500
She's pregnant, idiot.

1:15:34.041 --> 1:15:35.250
[Doug] Guy's such an asshole.

1:15:35.333 --> 1:15:38.458
Always bitching at me
to take shorter bathroom breaks.

1:15:39.083 --> 1:15:41.250
Anyway,
the guy fucked me out of a week's pay.

1:15:41.333 --> 1:15:44.250
Fuckin' Trent. Not even a real name.

1:15:44.833 --> 1:15:47.416
-Get a fuckin' name, Trent!
-[all laugh]

1:15:48.291 --> 1:15:50.250
I was thinkin' about going over there.

1:15:50.916 --> 1:15:51.791
Fuck shit up.

1:15:51.875 --> 1:15:53.666
How are we gonna get out there?

1:15:54.291 --> 1:15:55.333
Shit.

1:15:59.750 --> 1:16:01.958

-Hell yeah.

Fuckin' Trent.

1:16:15.583 --> 1:16:16.416

1:16:17.541 --> 1:16:18.583

1:16:19.916 --> 1:16:20.750
Come on, J.D.

1:16:21.458 --> 1:16:22.666
Come on. Let's go.

-[teen 1] Smash it!
-[teen 2] All righty!

1:16:59.291 --> 1:17:00.583
[J.D.] Are you sure he's here?

1:17:00.666 --> 1:17:04.083
Well, where else would he be?
He hasn't worked since 2007.

1:17:04.166 --> 1:17:07.791
He inherited the top floor of this dump.
Thinks he's a land baron.

-The hell?

I ever did in my life worth shit.

They all coulda,
or he coulda gone to jail.

1:19:58.750 --> 1:20:01.958
He needed me
and I just kept leaving him there.

1:20:02.041 --> 1:20:04.708
What he needed was his damn mother.

1:20:05.250 --> 1:20:07.458
I just kept running off with Kevin.

1:20:08.291 --> 1:20:10.791
Didn't even ask him if he wanted to come.

1:20:11.791 --> 1:20:15.458
Aw, honey, you got a right
to your own life.

1:20:16.041 --> 1:20:18.208
J.D. ain't your responsibility.

[Mamaw] Hey!

1:20:38.750 --> 1:20:40.708
What in God's name happened back there?

1:20:40.791 --> 1:20:42.875
That lard-ass called the cops on me.

1:20:42.958 --> 1:20:46.500
Why did J.D. think you was going
to kill him? What'd you do to him?

1:20:46.583 --> 1:20:49.750
Nothing. He said some shit. I got mad--

1:20:49.833 --> 1:20:51.666
-Did you hit him?
-It's not serious.

1:20:51.750 --> 1:20:53.708
Should I have let him get hit by a car?

1:20:53.791 --> 1:20:56.916
-If he wasn't being a little shit--
-You've always got a reason!

1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:58.666
It's always someone else's fault.

1:20:58.750 --> 1:21:01.916
Some point,
you're gonna have to take responsibility

1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:04.000
-or someone else is gonna have to…
-Or what?

1:21:04.083 --> 1:21:06.666
-…step in!
-Who, huh? Who?

1:21:07.541 --> 1:21:08.833
You?

1:21:09.500 --> 1:21:11.208
What are you gonna do?

1:38:52.458 --> 1:38:53.500
[Bev wailing]

1:38:56.666 --> 1:38:57.750
Christ, Mom!

1:38:57.833 --> 1:38:59.375
[Bev crying]

1:38:59.458 --> 1:39:00.666
[Bev screams]

1:39:00.750 --> 1:39:03.041
What's wrong with you, Mom? Come on!

1:39:17.250 --> 1:39:18.625
-Mom, I--
-Don't you touch me!

1:39:18.708 --> 1:39:21.000
You get away from me! Bastard!

1:39:28.291 --> 1:39:29.500
[Bev crying]

1:39:40.791 --> 1:39:41.791
Christ.

1:39:45.583 --> 1:39:48.250
-Let's get you to bed.
-I'm so sorry, baby.

1:39:48.333 --> 1:39:49.916
-I know, Mom.
-I'm so sorry.

1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:52.166
I know, Mom. It's okay.

1:39:57.833 --> 1:39:59.750
-[mumbles]
-I know, Mom.

1:40:05.416 --> 1:40:06.625
[Bev sobbing]

1:40:22.333 --> 1:40:23.375
[sighs]

1:40:33.833 --> 1:40:35.291
[Bev] Stay with me.

1:40:51.541 --> 1:40:52.541
[sniffles]

1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:07.375
[no audible dialogue]

1:41:14.791 --> 1:41:17.000
[no audible dialogue]

1:41:36.250 --> 1:41:38.791
[J.D.] "For now we see
through a glass darkly,

1:41:40.541 --> 1:41:41.916
but then face-to-face.

1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:43.333
Now I know in part,

1:41:43.958 --> 1:41:47.125
then shall I know
even as also I am known."

1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:03.875
Get the surp.

1:42:04.375 --> 1:42:06.583
-Get the what?
-The surp.

1:42:07.625 --> 1:42:09.333
Can't have pancakes without surp.

1:42:09.416 --> 1:42:12.500
Oh, my God, J.D.
It's not "surp," it's "syrup."

1:42:12.583 --> 1:42:13.708
-Surp.
-Syrup.

1:42:13.791 --> 1:42:15.000
[laughing] Oh, God.

1:42:15.083 --> 1:42:17.166
-If you think that--
-You're so cute!

1:42:17.250 --> 1:42:18.791
If you think this is so…

1:42:18.875 --> 1:42:21.375
-We're not gonna be able to eat. Usha.
-Say it again.

1:42:21.458 --> 1:42:22.291
-Syrup.
-Surp.

1:42:22.375 --> 1:42:24.375
If I say it, will you get the damn surp?

1:42:24.458 --> 1:42:25.458
-Say it again.
-Surp.

1:42:25.541 --> 1:42:26.791
-Surp.
-Now please…

1:42:26.875 --> 1:42:27.958
[both laugh]

1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:48.041
I love you, Mom.

1:42:54.041 --> 1:42:55.416
I want you to get better.

1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:57.958
-I know.
-For you to be happy.

1:43:01.125 --> 1:43:02.250
And I'll help you.

1:43:02.750 --> 1:43:04.375
I'll do everything I can.

1:43:09.250 --> 1:43:10.500
But I can't stay.

1:43:15.750 --> 1:43:17.583
I'm not saving anyone here.

1:43:22.750 --> 1:43:24.083
Lindsay's on her way.

1:43:27.083 --> 1:43:29.166
I really hope you'll wait for her.

1:43:30.625 --> 1:43:31.708
[Bev sobbing softly]

1:43:33.583 --> 1:43:34.875
But I have to go.

1:44:17.583 --> 1:44:18.875
Don't give up, Mom.

1:44:23.541 --> 1:44:24.541
[door closes]

1:44:29.416 --> 1:44:30.833
[exhales deeply]

1:45:09.583 --> 1:45:13.291
[cell phone vibrating]

1:45:16.208 --> 1:45:17.125
Hey.

1:45:17.208 --> 1:45:18.750
[J.D. sighs] Hey.

1:45:19.291 --> 1:45:20.333
Where are you?

1:45:20.916 --> 1:45:21.750
I'm driving.

1:45:22.375 --> 1:45:23.250
Back?

1:45:24.250 --> 1:45:25.083
Yeah.

1:45:30.208 --> 1:45:31.083
Yeah. uh…

1:45:32.625 --> 1:45:35.416
Look, Usha, I'm… I'm sorry.

1:45:36.416 --> 1:45:41.708
I'm sorry I didn't just come out
and tell you all this stuff before. Uh…

1:45:43.208 --> 1:45:46.583
Guess I was just worried
that I'd scare you off.

1:45:51.041 --> 1:45:52.000
Did I?

1:45:54.791 --> 1:45:55.875
Not even close.

1:45:58.833 --> 1:45:59.916
Where are you now?

1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:03.250
Uh, comin' up on Columbus.

1:46:03.333 --> 1:46:07.000
Columbus? Unless you drive
like hell, you're not gonna make it.

1:46:07.083 --> 1:46:11.375
I survived Tactical Driving
in the Marines, okay? I can handle I-70.

1:46:11.458 --> 1:46:13.750
Okay. I'm keeping you company.

1:46:13.833 --> 1:46:17.041
No, babe. Just go back to sleep.
Please, it's late.

1:46:17.125 --> 1:46:18.916
Nope. We're doin' this.

1:46:21.750 --> 1:46:22.875
Let's see, uh…

1:46:24.333 --> 1:46:25.375
So, um…

1:46:26.416 --> 1:46:28.125
Read any good books lately?

1:46:28.208 --> 1:46:32.416
Yeah. Yeah, Cases and Materials
on Statutory Interpretation.

1:46:32.500 --> 1:46:34.125
Oh, sounds hot.

1:46:34.208 --> 1:46:35.833
[chuckles] It's a best seller.

1:46:39.208 --> 1:46:44.166
In boot camp, the only way you're allowed
to talk to your family is with letters.

1:46:44.250 --> 1:46:47.541
And my family, they--
yeah, they wrote me every day.

1:46:48.583 --> 1:46:51.500
Mamaw's letters were just the greatest.

1:46:52.125 --> 1:46:56.166
She would go from,
"Jesus walks with you, J.D. Stay strong.

1:46:56.250 --> 1:46:58.791
Don't forget that." To, uh… [laughs]

1:46:59.375 --> 1:47:03.958
"I wish I had a gun so I could shoot
that dickhead drill sergeant of yours."

1:47:04.041 --> 1:47:05.041
[chuckles]

1:47:09.958 --> 1:47:11.083
[horn honks]

1:47:11.166 --> 1:47:14.500
[J.D.] My grandparents just
left everything they knew behind

1:47:14.583 --> 1:47:18.000
and started over
with what they could fit in Papaw's truck.

1:47:18.083 --> 1:47:19.750
Yeah.

1:47:19.833 --> 1:47:22.083
That's… that's like my dad.

1:47:22.958 --> 1:47:24.500
He came here with nothing.

1:47:25.500 --> 1:47:27.208
He had to just find his way.

1:47:34.458 --> 1:47:37.375
I think that's
what kills me the most about Mamaw.

1:47:39.791 --> 1:47:42.166
I never got to tell people, uh…

1:47:43.083 --> 1:47:45.416
just how much she meant to me.

1:47:48.708 --> 1:47:50.625
She'd been sick a long time,

1:47:50.708 --> 1:47:52.750
but when it happened, I couldn't…

1:47:52.833 --> 1:47:53.916
[sniffles]

1:47:57.541 --> 1:48:01.500
[voice breaks] Yeah, I couldn't, like,
believe she was actually gone.

1:48:02.833 --> 1:48:04.250
Wish I could have met her.

1:48:06.416 --> 1:48:07.500
Yeah, me, too.

1:48:11.916 --> 1:48:14.125
[chuckles] Yeah.

1:48:19.458 --> 1:48:20.500
Where are you now?

1:48:20.583 --> 1:48:23.916
I had to get off I-95
because the traffic was so bad.

1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:27.250
I'm on some side street.
I'll be there in about an hour.

1:48:28.208 --> 1:48:29.291
An hour?

1:48:30.125 --> 1:48:32.250
-You're not gonna make it.
-I know.

1:48:32.333 --> 1:48:33.791
I don't know what to do, Usha.

1:48:33.875 --> 1:48:36.791
Can you go down there
and tell him I'm on my way, please?

1:48:38.458 --> 1:48:40.750
Yeah, yes, I can do that.

1:48:41.375 --> 1:48:43.291
Okay, I'll call you right back.

1:48:43.375 --> 1:48:45.291
Okay? It's gonna be fine. Drive safe.

1:49:03.833 --> 1:49:06.166
[J.D.] Twice I've needed to be rescued.

1:49:07.041 --> 1:49:09.875
The first time it was Mamaw who saved me.

1:49:11.083 --> 1:49:12.250
[woman] J.D. Vance?

1:49:12.333 --> 1:49:13.166
Yeah.

1:49:13.250 --> 1:49:15.666
[J.D.] The second,
it was what she taught me.

1:49:15.750 --> 1:49:17.875
That where we come from is who we are,

1:49:17.958 --> 1:49:20.875
but we choose every day who we become.

1:49:21.791 --> 1:49:25.166
My family's not perfect,
but they made me who I am

1:49:25.250 --> 1:49:27.625
and gave me chances that they never had.

1:49:28.250 --> 1:49:32.083
My future,
whatever it is, is our shared legacy.

1:49:33.083 --> 1:49:34.375
Good to see you again.

1:49:34.458 --> 1:49:35.458
Thank you.

1:49:36.333 --> 1:49:37.583
I'm glad to be here.
