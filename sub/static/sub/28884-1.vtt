00:20.537 --> 00:23.605
I love each and
every one of you who have

00:23.607 --> 00:26.107
supported me over the
years with all my heart.

00:28.511 --> 00:32.378
It's difficult for me to come
to terms with my diagnosis,

00:32.381 --> 00:37.386
but I do know that the
emotional bond we share is real.

00:42.124 --> 00:45.493
So while I only have a
few months left to live,

00:45.495 --> 00:49.162
I'm reminded that even though
I've only met a few you

00:49.164 --> 00:53.935
in person, that our time
together has made my life

00:53.937 --> 00:55.872
everything I always
wanted it to be.

00:57.673 --> 00:59.609
I'm so grateful for all of you,

01:01.143 --> 01:03.445
and I made this flash
to remember you all.

01:05.581 --> 01:07.147
Fucking cunt.

01:07.149 --> 01:08.016
What?

01:08.018 --> 01:09.683
Laura, I hate her.

01:09.685 --> 01:11.486
Laura, who is dying of cancer?

01:11.488 --> 01:12.686
Oh, c'mon, you know
she's just doing it

01:12.688 --> 01:14.588
to get to the top of
the charts for the week.

01:14.590 --> 01:17.257
She got cancer so she
could get the most views?

01:17.259 --> 01:19.060
Maybe she didn't get
cancer for that reason,

01:19.062 --> 01:20.560
but she's definitely milking it.

01:20.562 --> 01:22.462
She's going to be
dead in a few months.

01:22.464 --> 01:23.664
I think you can wait that long

01:23.666 --> 01:25.198
to get back to number
one on str33ker.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.601
I was number
one for six weeks.

01:26.603 --> 01:28.135
Seven would have
been a record str33k.

01:28.137 --> 01:30.070
Well, maybe when
Laura is dead,

01:30.072 --> 01:31.975
you can get that
str33k started again.

01:35.077 --> 01:37.947
Shouldn't you be studying for
that exam tomorrow, anyway?

01:39.315 --> 01:41.248
I have to get
ready for the party.

01:41.250 --> 01:43.084
You're going, right?

01:43.086 --> 01:44.918
Do I really have to?

01:44.920 --> 01:46.486
I really need to study.

01:46.488 --> 01:49.189
I still don't understand this
taxonomy stuff that well yet.

01:49.191 --> 01:51.358
Kinky people can
often find good sex.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.659
That's all you need to remember.

01:52.661 --> 01:54.429
Ha, ha, very funny,

01:54.431 --> 01:56.831
but I don't think
that's gonna be enough.

01:56.833 --> 01:59.534
We have to memorize
like 200 plant species.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.668
I'm sure you can study
wallflowers at the party.

02:01.670 --> 02:02.505
Get ready.

02:04.006 --> 02:05.206
Whose party is it?

02:05.208 --> 02:07.441
I don't know, some
old guy who still thinks

02:07.443 --> 02:10.277
it's appropriate to be hanging
out with college students.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.678
Ugh, that's creepy.

02:11.680 --> 02:12.612
It's a Halloween party.

02:12.614 --> 02:13.850
It's supposed to be creepy.

02:23.827 --> 02:25.660
Hello Bailey Nation,

02:25.662 --> 02:28.862
or Bailey World,
Bailey Universe.

02:28.864 --> 02:30.898
We've been number one
for the past five weeks,

02:30.900 --> 02:33.233
and I just wanna thank
all of my awesome fans

02:33.235 --> 02:38.071
with, da, da, da, da, a tour
of Hollywood's weirdest!

02:38.073 --> 02:40.340
Also, I wanna thank
my very, very,

02:40.342 --> 02:42.176
very unfortunately
short roommate,

02:42.178 --> 02:44.779
Emma, who's helping
us film today.

02:44.781 --> 02:46.047
Emma is super studious,

02:46.049 --> 02:47.881
but I believe she
has a really fun side

02:47.883 --> 02:49.750
underneath all those
piles of books,

02:49.752 --> 02:52.920
and when she finds out the
scientific cure for nerdom,

02:52.922 --> 02:55.123
she'll be having as much
fun as the rest of us.

02:55.125 --> 02:56.459
Emma, say hi.

02:59.061 --> 03:02.095
You know, Emma, smiling
doesn't cost you anything.

03:02.097 --> 03:04.731
Alright, so let's
see what cannibal

03:04.733 --> 03:08.236
hobo freaks we can find today.

04:00.823 --> 04:04.826
So, uh, I know I've been
quiet this entire time,

04:04.828 --> 04:08.362
but honestly, I'm just
in shock right now.

04:08.364 --> 04:09.331
What now?

04:11.567 --> 04:14.603
Are you dressed
as a, as a poop?

04:16.438 --> 04:17.273
Yes.

04:18.673 --> 04:21.608
So you thought it was a good
idea to go to a cool party

04:21.611 --> 04:24.679
where you're gonna meet new
people dressed as a turd?

04:24.681 --> 04:25.946
A poop.

04:25.948 --> 04:27.348
A turd is a poop.

04:27.350 --> 04:30.350
No, a turd is a specific
type of excrement.

04:30.352 --> 04:32.153
A poop is more general.

04:32.155 --> 04:33.353
I am a poop.

04:33.355 --> 04:38.360
So, you're generally speaking,

04:39.796 --> 04:42.062
depicting a broad category of
excrement with your costume

04:42.064 --> 04:45.999
as opposed to a specific,
single type of excrement?

04:46.001 --> 04:46.835
Yes.

04:49.371 --> 04:51.372
Okay then, moving on.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.840
When we get to the party,
if anyone talks to you,

04:53.842 --> 04:56.877
which I highly doubt because
you're dressed as a turd.

04:56.879 --> 04:57.811
A poop.

04:57.813 --> 04:59.482
Whatever, a frickin poop.

05:00.883 --> 05:03.985
Just don't mention anything
about the str33k, okay?

05:03.987 --> 05:05.386
Especially if Brayden's there.

05:05.388 --> 05:06.222
Fine.

05:07.323 --> 05:09.756
But you can
smile, if you want.

05:09.758 --> 05:10.992
I don't.

05:10.994 --> 05:12.025
How 'bout laughing?

05:14.330 --> 05:16.699
Good enough for a poop.

05:28.845 --> 05:30.011
What's up lion buddy?

05:36.251 --> 05:41.256
Kinky people
can often find.

05:42.624 --> 05:44.124
Did you see that poseur
carrot at the party?

05:44.126 --> 05:46.093
Oh, right.

05:46.095 --> 05:47.929
Oh, that's her.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.396
Hey, guys.

05:49.398 --> 05:52.299
Bailey, I can't believe
you lost your str33k.

05:52.301 --> 05:55.102
Oh, yeah, well,
Laura, you know?

05:55.104 --> 05:56.603
She's probably faking it.

05:56.605 --> 05:58.840
Yeah, um, excuse me.

06:04.313 --> 06:08.749
Did I ever tell you
yellow is my favorite color?

06:08.751 --> 06:12.020
- This was a fun party.
- Oh, you stink.

06:14.323 --> 06:16.925
Hi, Bailey.

06:21.063 --> 06:21.898
Hey, Brayden.

06:23.765 --> 06:25.633
I'm a little busy.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.235
Oh, you weren't too
busy to call me every

06:27.237 --> 06:29.502
single day last week
begging to hang out.

06:29.504 --> 06:31.172
Well, you had a
str33k then, now.

06:31.174 --> 06:33.107
Oh, now I'm just nobody?

06:33.109 --> 06:34.109
Yeah, pretty much.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.912
You know roses are my thing.

06:37.914 --> 06:39.980
I don't think you own
the legal rights to roses.

06:39.982 --> 06:41.249
I don't think
you own the legal

06:41.251 --> 06:42.283
rights to being a
fucking dickhead.

06:42.285 --> 06:43.285
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

06:44.621 --> 06:45.787
Well, you're a loser.

06:46.922 --> 06:48.122
Good one.

06:48.124 --> 06:49.124
Give me back my key.

06:54.429 --> 06:55.862
You're finally gonna see
how many bolts you get

06:55.864 --> 06:57.098
on your flashes when you don't

06:57.100 --> 06:58.331
have a woman doing
everything for you.

06:58.333 --> 06:59.600
Oh, but I'm nobody, right?

06:59.602 --> 07:01.201
Whatever, I got a
flash on the charts.

07:01.203 --> 07:02.302
Oh you do, really?

07:02.304 --> 07:03.537
Mm-hmm.

07:03.539 --> 07:04.705
Is it the one that
I edited and shot,

07:04.707 --> 07:07.343
or the one that I
wrote, edited and shot?

07:09.011 --> 07:12.646
Bye now.

07:12.648 --> 07:14.282
Ugh!

08:02.398 --> 08:04.364
Yeah, so like, whose
lame party is this anyway?

08:04.366 --> 08:07.568
Do you guys mind,
I'm trying to study!

08:07.570 --> 08:09.072
Oh, sorry.

08:09.972 --> 08:11.739
Ugh!

08:11.741 --> 08:16.746
Kinky people can
often find good sex.

08:17.612 --> 08:18.746
Are you dressed as a turd?

08:18.748 --> 08:19.916
Oh shut up.

08:22.051 --> 08:24.620
Next year I'm dressing
as something more popular.

08:32.561 --> 08:34.328
Bailey!

08:34.330 --> 08:36.962
Bailey!

08:36.965 --> 08:39.866
Bailey!

08:39.869 --> 08:42.969
Bailey!

08:42.971 --> 08:45.939
Bailey!

08:45.941 --> 08:48.041
Bailey!

08:48.043 --> 08:51.547
Bailey!

08:53.950 --> 08:56.083
It's 4 A.M., come
on we have to go.

08:56.085 --> 08:57.117
Okay, okay, no.

08:57.119 --> 08:57.952
Five more minutes.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.620
No come on, get up.

08:59.622 --> 09:00.420
Okay, I'm going, I'm going.

09:00.422 --> 09:02.055
No you can't walk.

09:02.057 --> 09:03.223
No be careful!

09:03.225 --> 09:04.924
No, no, no you're drunk.

09:04.926 --> 09:06.227
No be careful, be careful.

09:06.229 --> 09:08.328
No, no, no, no,
no, no be careful.

09:13.034 --> 09:14.436
What's so funny?

09:16.071 --> 09:17.105
Nothing's funny here.

09:36.526 --> 09:39.459
Come on, you're okay.

09:39.461 --> 09:42.096
I'm so drunk Emma.

09:42.098 --> 09:43.332
I can tell.

09:44.633 --> 09:47.233
I'm really angry
with you right now.

09:47.235 --> 09:48.069
Why?

09:49.439 --> 09:51.307
You know I don't
know how to drive.

09:54.877 --> 09:58.112
Then why are you sitting
in the driver's seat?

09:58.114 --> 09:59.914
They taught us in health
class in high school

09:59.916 --> 10:01.281
that it is better
to drive without

10:01.283 --> 10:03.583
a license than it
is to drive drunk.

10:03.585 --> 10:06.388
Oh, I bet you got an
A, miss smarty pants.

10:07.690 --> 10:08.523
I did.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.161
You're gonna fail
that test tomorrow.

10:14.029 --> 10:18.799
Kinky people, something.

10:18.801 --> 10:20.369
Fuck, who cares?

10:21.571 --> 10:23.871
Well, Professor
Vargas probably does.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.772
No she doesn't.

10:25.774 --> 10:28.343
She comments on all my
flashes, she doesn't care.

10:29.579 --> 10:31.681
Everyone just cares
about flashes, anyway.

10:33.782 --> 10:35.748
That's not true.

10:35.750 --> 10:37.119
People like you for you.

10:39.088 --> 10:40.656
You don't even like me for me.

10:41.590 --> 10:42.424
I do too.

10:43.426 --> 10:45.228
I liked you before the flashes.

10:47.028 --> 10:49.128
I still like you now.

10:49.130 --> 10:52.665
I just wish you cared about
something other than clicks.

10:52.667 --> 10:54.602
And I also wish that you
were driving right now

10:54.604 --> 10:56.237
because this is making
me very anxious.

10:56.239 --> 10:57.538
Oh wow, we're
getting real real

10:57.540 --> 10:59.506
in the car right now, okay.

10:59.508 --> 11:01.242
It's a safe space here.

11:01.244 --> 11:02.775
So safe.

11:02.777 --> 11:06.413
Soon we'll be hurling down
the street, out of control.

11:06.415 --> 11:08.348
We're hurtling down the
street out of control.

11:08.350 --> 11:09.549
Stop, stop!

11:09.551 --> 11:11.484
No, you're not making
me feel any better

11:11.486 --> 11:12.719
about this driving thing.

11:12.721 --> 11:14.221
Okay, then we'll
just stay here then.

11:14.223 --> 11:16.656
Jesus Christ, I
don't give a fuck.

11:16.658 --> 11:18.157
No, I can't do that.

11:18.159 --> 11:20.627
I didn't have any time to
study at that stupid party,

11:20.629 --> 11:21.694
we wasted a ton of time.

11:21.696 --> 11:24.299
Oh that party was so stupid.

11:25.734 --> 11:28.636
Everyone there just liked
me cause I had a str33k.

11:28.638 --> 11:33.107
And now they like Laura
who is dying of cancer.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.407
Whatever, she'll be dead soon,

11:34.409 --> 11:36.077
then everyone will
like me again.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.314
I have a plan.

11:39.648 --> 11:42.016
Okay, am I involved
in this plan somehow?

11:42.018 --> 11:42.884
Uh, duh.

11:44.854 --> 11:47.223
Well, do you wanna
tell me about it?

11:49.792 --> 11:51.694
In due time my dear.

11:52.894 --> 11:54.663
In due time.

12:00.802 --> 12:04.572
I knew I could get you.

12:48.117 --> 12:50.918
I can't get my key out
if I'm holding you up.

12:50.920 --> 12:53.687
Ugh!

12:53.689 --> 12:56.122
I lost my key.

12:56.124 --> 12:57.323
What do you mean?

12:57.325 --> 12:58.458
I thought you
brought your own key

12:58.460 --> 13:00.196
and you got Brayden's key back.

13:00.997 --> 13:01.895
Oh yeah.

13:01.897 --> 13:03.997
Hold on.

13:03.999 --> 13:05.232
Ugh.

13:13.308 --> 13:17.011
Oh, no no no.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.945
Come on.

13:41.903 --> 13:44.170
No, you're fine.

13:44.172 --> 13:45.939
I'm gonna make this
bed for you okay?

13:45.941 --> 13:48.076
Oh no, I don't want it.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.144
Good night.

13:50.146 --> 13:51.781
Wait, we need to
say our prayers.

13:54.082 --> 13:55.214
Fine.

13:55.216 --> 13:56.684
Okay you start.

13:56.686 --> 13:59.620
Dear Lord, please
let Bailey go to sleep

13:59.622 --> 14:02.055
and wake up with no
hangover so I don't

14:02.057 --> 14:04.257
have to hear her
complain tomorrow.

14:04.259 --> 14:05.291
Ugh good one.

14:05.293 --> 14:06.760
Okay.

14:06.762 --> 14:09.796
Dear Lord, please do that
thing that Emma said,

14:09.798 --> 14:11.865
and also please give
me the confidence

14:11.867 --> 14:13.766
of a mediocre white
man so I can go

14:13.768 --> 14:16.336
through my life as
brazen as I'd like.

14:16.338 --> 14:17.570
Did you really need that?

14:17.572 --> 14:19.606
Oh and please
make sure that Laura

14:19.608 --> 14:23.010
gets better so that
she can stop hogging

14:23.012 --> 14:24.277
the top of the str33ker charts

14:24.279 --> 14:26.612
and I can get my record
str33k going again.

14:26.614 --> 14:28.348
You're a real saint, Bailey.

14:28.350 --> 14:30.883
No one can say I
don't care about others.

14:30.885 --> 14:31.720
Goodnight.

14:54.176 --> 14:56.075
Like every patriotic American,

14:56.077 --> 14:57.611
you wanna start
your morning right

14:57.613 --> 15:00.848
with delicious, nutritious
toaster pastries.

15:00.850 --> 15:04.718
But heating up normal toaster
pastries is such a hassle.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.819
They never fit in the toaster.

15:06.821 --> 15:10.424
Even when they do, they
always come out too cold.

15:10.426 --> 15:11.824
Or too hot.

15:12.628 --> 15:13.861
Well, not anymore.

15:13.863 --> 15:16.530
With new toot strudels
radioactive flavors.

15:16.532 --> 15:18.866
Toot strudels radioactive
flavors use patented

15:18.868 --> 15:20.733
nuclear technology to self heat

15:20.735 --> 15:23.035
to precisely the
right temperature.

15:23.037 --> 15:24.304
Just open the packaging,

15:24.306 --> 15:26.607
exposing the atomic
isotopes to air,

15:26.609 --> 15:30.012
and in seconds your toot
strudels are ready to eat.

15:32.480 --> 15:36.183
Normal toaster pastries get
cold before you can finish them.

15:36.185 --> 15:40.253
Toot strudels stay the perfect
temperature all day long.

15:40.255 --> 15:41.854
Don't spend hours making perfect

15:41.856 --> 15:43.756
toaster pastries for breakfast,

15:43.758 --> 15:45.324
throw away that toaster!

15:45.326 --> 15:49.262
With three toot strudels
fluorescent glow favorites.

15:49.264 --> 15:51.198
Radioactive watermelon!

15:51.200 --> 15:53.232
Atomic eggplant!

15:53.234 --> 15:55.001
And nuclear celery.

15:55.003 --> 15:57.871
And of course, no one can
eat just one toot strudel.

15:57.873 --> 15:59.573
So we put two amazing,

15:59.575 --> 16:02.342
perfectly baked
strudels in every pouch.

16:02.344 --> 16:04.678
That's right, two
perfect temperature

16:04.680 --> 16:06.914
toot strudels in every pouch.

16:06.916 --> 16:08.582
So you get a double
dose that will set

16:08.584 --> 16:11.684
your Geiger counters
clicking every single day.

16:11.686 --> 16:13.820
And don't forget to take
our which toot strudel

16:13.822 --> 16:16.689
are you quiz to find
out if you are cool

16:16.691 --> 16:19.492
and confident like
radioactive watermelon.

16:19.494 --> 16:22.462
Strong and steady,
like nuclear celery.

16:22.464 --> 16:25.600
Or spontaneous and weird,
like atomic eggplant.

16:29.537 --> 16:30.703
Hello!

16:30.705 --> 16:32.707
I am Professor Wolfgang
van Tütstrudel!

16:33.942 --> 16:37.511
The inventor of the
patented toot strudel

16:37.513 --> 16:39.715
self heating toaster pastry.

16:40.816 --> 16:43.049
Join me on November 11th

16:43.051 --> 16:46.285
for National Toaster Pastry Day.

16:46.287 --> 16:50.823
And you could win a lifetime
supply of toot strudels.

16:50.825 --> 16:54.527
That's right, three
square meals a day

16:54.529 --> 16:58.732
of toot strudels for the
rest of your existence.

16:58.734 --> 17:03.002
Just upload your best
five bolt flashes

17:03.004 --> 17:05.371
about what toot
strudels mean to you.

17:05.373 --> 17:08.075
And you could be
our lucky winner.

17:08.077 --> 17:09.710
Toot strudels!

17:09.712 --> 17:12.779
The official toaster
pastry of str33ker.

17:12.781 --> 17:16.884
There's froot in every toot.

17:20.555 --> 17:22.021
Froot contains no
flavors, colors, pulp,

17:22.022 --> 17:25.993
or other natural derivatives
of fruits or vegetables.

17:27.295 --> 17:32.132
Kinky people can often find

17:32.134 --> 17:34.336
good sex.

17:40.376 --> 17:42.442
Hey there sleepy head.

17:42.444 --> 17:43.409
That was some party last night.

17:43.411 --> 17:44.344
Shh!

17:44.346 --> 17:46.312
Why do you have to be so loud?

17:46.314 --> 17:47.547
Please.

17:47.549 --> 17:50.751
Um, I was speaking at
normal indoor volume.

17:50.753 --> 17:53.522
Don't try to confuse me
with your flawless logic,

17:54.122 --> 17:55.355
Emma, okay?

17:55.357 --> 17:57.725
I have not seen you
this hungover in awhile.

17:59.561 --> 18:01.395
I think you had one too many.

18:01.397 --> 18:03.999
Ten too many.

18:05.333 --> 18:08.670
Ugh, thank god, I'm starving.

18:19.514 --> 18:23.017
Fine, fine, I'll just
have a glass of water.

18:27.555 --> 18:29.023
Mm, filling.

18:31.126 --> 18:34.161
You know I had the
strangest dream last night?

18:34.163 --> 18:35.896
About what?

18:35.898 --> 18:37.097
You were in the shower.

18:37.099 --> 18:38.030
Perv.

18:38.032 --> 18:39.132
No!

18:39.134 --> 18:40.500
Not like that.

18:40.502 --> 18:43.036
Not all sexy and stuff.

18:43.038 --> 18:44.437
Are you saying I'm not sexy?

18:44.439 --> 18:45.840
You know what I mean.

18:47.943 --> 18:50.444
Anyway, you were in the shower.

18:50.446 --> 18:54.681
I saw a face glowing in
the reflection of the door.

18:54.683 --> 18:57.084
It was an evil face.

18:57.086 --> 18:58.751
And then they pulled out a knife

18:58.753 --> 19:01.588
and started stabbing
at you wildly.

19:01.590 --> 19:03.324
You were spitting out blood.

19:04.225 --> 19:05.492
And you reached for the glass

19:05.494 --> 19:08.797
and left a hand print
on it, and then fell.

19:10.264 --> 19:13.367
And the killer was
breathing heavily.

19:13.369 --> 19:15.668
I could hear their heartbeat.

19:15.670 --> 19:20.040
I saw the knife and it
said doppelgänger on it.

19:20.042 --> 19:22.576
Why would the knife
say doppelgänger on it?

19:22.578 --> 19:23.909
I don't know!

19:23.911 --> 19:26.215
That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

19:27.148 --> 19:28.882
I can't control my dreams!

19:28.884 --> 19:29.849
Sure you can.

19:29.851 --> 19:31.285
Have better dreams next time.

19:37.959 --> 19:40.092
How did you film this?

19:40.094 --> 19:40.928
Film what?

19:42.363 --> 19:44.030
Us coming home last night?

19:44.032 --> 19:46.001
I don't remember
anything from last night.

19:47.668 --> 19:48.836
Take a look at this.

19:50.872 --> 19:52.571
I can't get my key
out if I'm holding you up.

19:52.573 --> 19:56.242
What the fuck?

19:56.244 --> 19:58.177
This is terrifying.

19:58.179 --> 19:59.646
I'm calling the police.

19:59.648 --> 20:00.981
How many views does it have?

20:00.983 --> 20:02.717
I thought
you had your own key

20:03.452 --> 20:04.119
and got Brayden's back?

20:04.852 --> 20:06.888
20,000 and rising.

20:07.923 --> 20:09.425
Five bolts?

20:10.426 --> 20:11.926
Five bolts.

20:13.361 --> 20:14.194
Don't worry about it then.

20:14.196 --> 20:15.694
Don't call the police.

20:15.696 --> 20:17.798
It's probably just creepy
Mrs. Wilson from next door.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.066
She's harmless.

20:19.068 --> 20:20.903
But how did she
get your password?

20:22.303 --> 20:24.136
I don't know,
I'll just change it.

20:24.138 --> 20:24.971
Who cares?

20:24.973 --> 20:26.473
Don't freak out.

20:26.475 --> 20:27.706
I'm too hungover to deal
with it right now, anyway.

20:27.708 --> 20:29.610
Plus it will start
a new str33k for me.

20:30.812 --> 20:33.046
We had better get
to that exam anyway.

20:33.048 --> 20:35.682
Kinky people can
often find good sex.

20:35.684 --> 20:38.617
How could you joke
at a time like this?

20:38.619 --> 20:39.418
Joke?

20:39.420 --> 20:40.221
I'm studying.

20:44.126 --> 20:46.893
Okay class, you
have 15 minutes.

20:46.895 --> 20:49.829
I just want to give
you a little hint

20:49.831 --> 20:50.631
for the classification
taxonomy on number 13.

21:02.778 --> 21:04.113
Shh! Be quiet

21:06.849 --> 21:08.647
I don't know like
90% of this shit.

21:08.649 --> 21:12.753
Shh, knock it off or
you'll flunk us both.

21:22.664 --> 21:24.500
I don't know like
90% of this shit.

21:26.435 --> 21:31.070
Shh, cut it out.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.640
Is there a problem, ladies?

21:35.377 --> 21:37.644
Yeah, actually...

21:37.646 --> 21:40.113
No, no, not at all,
Professor Vargas.

21:40.115 --> 21:42.449
Bailey just needed
to borrow a pencil.

21:42.451 --> 21:47.287
Very well, just remember
there's no talking during exams.

21:47.289 --> 21:49.255
Yes, Professor, of course.

21:49.257 --> 21:50.557
And both of you come and see

21:50.559 --> 21:52.528
me in my office after the exam.

22:21.557 --> 22:23.792
Fuck.

22:25.060 --> 22:29.828
I'm very disappointed,
especially in you, Emma.

22:29.830 --> 22:31.565
- I...
- Don't I.

22:31.567 --> 22:33.399
You should know
better than to ask

22:33.401 --> 22:35.868
Bailey for answers
during an exam.

22:35.870 --> 22:37.136
But you don't...

22:37.138 --> 22:40.440
No, now Bailey,
I am so sorry that

22:40.442 --> 22:43.742
you have to be a party
to this dishonesty.

22:43.744 --> 22:48.280
Let me present you with this
rose as a token of gratitude.

22:48.282 --> 22:49.883
- Thank you.
- Mmhmm.

22:49.885 --> 22:52.484
Professor Vargas, please
don't be too hard on her.

22:52.486 --> 22:53.787
She's really a good kid,

22:53.789 --> 22:56.088
and it's just hard
being my roommate

22:56.090 --> 22:57.624
with all the attention.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.291
I could only imagine.

22:59.293 --> 23:02.729
You know, your last
str33k was wonderful work.

23:02.731 --> 23:04.530
It's just I'm so sorry that that

23:04.532 --> 23:07.233
cancerous bitch
knocked you down.

23:07.235 --> 23:08.167
Well thank you
Professor Vargas.

23:08.169 --> 23:09.603
Oh no, you don't deserve it.

23:09.605 --> 23:11.037
Call me Harriet.

23:11.039 --> 23:13.473
- Oh, thank you, Harriet.
- Yes, thank you.

23:13.475 --> 23:14.741
Oh, cancer is hard to beat.

23:14.743 --> 23:17.409
Well, you can do it,
I have faith in you.

23:17.411 --> 23:19.511
I hope so, I think I can.

23:19.513 --> 23:22.350
Oh, I know you can,
I enjoy your work.

23:23.619 --> 23:25.719
She's so nice, isn't she?

23:25.721 --> 23:27.220
She, but she.

23:27.222 --> 23:29.222
I just wish all my professors
were that understanding.

23:29.224 --> 23:31.760
Hey, hey, um you
left my rose behind.

23:33.061 --> 23:34.828
So I did.

23:46.308 --> 23:50.777
So is it just me or was that
test, like, mostly pointless?

23:50.779 --> 23:52.511
Eh, it's just you.

23:52.513 --> 23:56.950
Yeah, like I said, Dr.
Vargas does not give a shit.

23:56.952 --> 23:57.916
Oh, God, don't look.

23:57.918 --> 23:59.618
It's that creeper, Mrs. Wilson.

23:59.620 --> 24:01.855
Hi girls, hi Bailey.

24:01.857 --> 24:02.688
I loved your latest flash.

24:02.690 --> 24:03.857
Hi Mrs. Wilson.

24:03.859 --> 24:04.691
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

24:04.693 --> 24:05.524
Bye.

24:05.526 --> 24:06.358
What are you doing?

24:06.360 --> 24:07.193
Don't talk to her.

24:07.195 --> 24:08.127
Why?

24:08.129 --> 24:08.927
She gave me 500 thousand views.

24:08.929 --> 24:09.697
If that was her.

24:11.233 --> 24:12.699
No, she's really creepy, I...

24:12.701 --> 24:14.603
Don't talk to her,
I don't trust her.

24:19.308 --> 24:20.540
Will you fail the
next test on purpose

24:20.542 --> 24:22.142
so that we can stay
in class together?

24:22.144 --> 24:24.511
Well, why don't you actually
try studying for once,

24:24.513 --> 24:26.514
and then we can stay
in class together.

24:27.616 --> 24:28.617
Nah, too annoying.

24:29.984 --> 24:30.916
Know what I've been thinking?

24:30.918 --> 24:33.185
Uh oh, you've been thinking?

24:33.187 --> 24:36.123
I know, it's painful, but
once in a while a neuron fires.

24:39.261 --> 24:42.662
I was thinking, why do
I even need college?

24:42.664 --> 24:44.164
What?

24:44.166 --> 24:46.465
I mean, I'm a junior,
and I'm still undeclared,

24:46.467 --> 24:48.702
and I don't really
care about much.

24:48.704 --> 24:52.338
I'm making awesome flashes
that get five bolts,

24:52.340 --> 24:54.107
that's what I'm good at.

24:54.109 --> 24:57.277
Bailey, you can't be serious?

24:57.279 --> 24:58.845
Why not?

24:58.847 --> 25:00.413
Bailey, are you crazy?

25:00.415 --> 25:03.215
You can't make a
living off of str33ker.

25:03.217 --> 25:05.117
But I'm famous.

25:05.119 --> 25:07.854
Bailey, you're
internet famous,

25:07.856 --> 25:10.723
not even internet famous,
but str33ker famous.

25:10.725 --> 25:12.925
Str33ker famous
and famous are two

25:12.927 --> 25:14.260
completely different things.

25:14.262 --> 25:15.561
You're being such
a bitch right now.

25:15.563 --> 25:17.431
I got five million
views just today.

25:18.833 --> 25:21.734
Yeah, of that guy
stalking you from outside.

25:21.736 --> 25:23.036
You have to think
about your future.

25:23.038 --> 25:24.436
I am thinking about my future.

25:24.438 --> 25:26.006
This is why I'm bringing it up.

25:27.175 --> 25:29.174
Wait, how do you
know it was a guy?

25:29.176 --> 25:30.643
That's sexist.

25:30.645 --> 25:32.511
Okay, I don't know
it was a guy, but...

25:32.513 --> 25:35.714
Okay, well, girls stalk
people too, sometimes.

25:35.716 --> 25:37.216
Okay, fine.

25:37.218 --> 25:38.417
Well, you need to think
about your future in case,

25:38.419 --> 25:40.587
the guy or girl stalker
doesn't murder you.

25:40.589 --> 25:42.555
What, so I can earn 70 cents

25:42.557 --> 25:44.790
to the dollar and
hit a glass ceiling?

25:44.792 --> 25:47.327
No one takes me seriously, Emma.

25:47.329 --> 25:49.028
Well, maybe if you
didn't act the way you act.

25:49.030 --> 25:50.562
How do I act?

25:50.564 --> 25:51.832
- The way you act...
- I what?

25:52.967 --> 25:55.467
Never mind, never mind.

25:55.469 --> 25:57.537
You're just twisting my words.

25:57.539 --> 25:59.539
You're too smart to
not be taken seriously.

25:59.541 --> 26:02.341
Okay, well maybe too
smart to get a normal job,

26:02.343 --> 26:05.110
and too smart to
lead a normal life.

26:05.112 --> 26:07.213
If I were dumber,
you'd be happier,

26:07.215 --> 26:09.449
then I could just be safe
and do the safe thing,

26:09.451 --> 26:10.716
is that what you're
asking me to do?

26:10.718 --> 26:12.452
Yeah, that's probably
what you should do,

26:12.454 --> 26:15.387
but you make it sound so bad.

26:15.389 --> 26:17.557
You're sounding
like a crazy person.

26:17.559 --> 26:20.527
You can't just sit around
making videos all day,

26:20.529 --> 26:21.728
not for a living.

26:21.730 --> 26:23.328
There are other
popular internet stars

26:23.330 --> 26:25.264
that you know that
make plenty of money.

26:25.266 --> 26:26.465
What's your point?

26:26.467 --> 26:27.934
My point is, I thought
you were my friend.

26:27.936 --> 26:29.202
What's that supposed to mean?

26:29.204 --> 26:30.970
It means you're
supposed to support me.

26:30.972 --> 26:32.938
I do support you,
that's why I'm always

26:32.940 --> 26:34.473
helping you make
your stupid videos.

26:34.475 --> 26:35.308
Stupid?

26:35.310 --> 26:37.342
They're flashes!

26:37.344 --> 26:39.111
That's not what I
meant, what I meant was...

26:39.113 --> 26:41.013
I know what you
meant, alright.

26:41.015 --> 26:42.281
No, hear me out.

26:42.283 --> 26:43.782
No, you said, you
said too much, dude.

26:43.784 --> 26:47.619
Just go get me my
sweatshirt, I'm cold.

26:59.167 --> 27:00.633
Bailey, did you
leave a grenade

27:00.635 --> 27:02.635
in your underwear this morning?

27:02.637 --> 27:04.503
Why?

27:04.505 --> 27:06.140
They're all over the floor.

27:46.013 --> 27:47.614
Aren't you freaking out?

27:47.616 --> 27:48.947
This your idea of a joke?

27:48.949 --> 27:50.517
What do you mean?

27:50.519 --> 27:52.151
You just told me to
stop making flashes,

27:52.153 --> 27:54.654
and then my most recent
one gets sabotaged?

27:54.656 --> 27:57.223
Bailey, that is not me
tossing your underwear around.

27:57.225 --> 27:58.724
I know it's not you, Emma.

27:58.726 --> 28:00.592
You're short as fuck, and
you're with me all day.

28:00.594 --> 28:04.030
My point, so what exactly
am I getting blamed for here?

28:04.032 --> 28:05.330
Who'd you get to do it?

28:05.332 --> 28:06.732
Who'd I get to do what?

28:06.734 --> 28:08.902
Come into your room
and act all creepy?

28:08.904 --> 28:10.403
Right, who?

28:10.405 --> 28:11.538
I know I'm your only friend,

28:11.540 --> 28:13.241
so did you hire someone or what?

28:14.676 --> 28:16.576
Okay, first of all, you
are not my only friend.

28:16.578 --> 28:17.409
Yes I am.

28:17.411 --> 28:18.877
No, you're not!

28:18.879 --> 28:21.481
Second of all, why on earth
would I hire someone to do this?

28:21.483 --> 28:23.616
You just told me to
stop making flashes.

28:23.618 --> 28:24.850
I did not.

28:24.852 --> 28:26.552
I said you could not
do this for a living.

28:26.554 --> 28:27.486
Ugh!

28:27.488 --> 28:28.687
You only hear what you want.

28:28.689 --> 28:30.322
You said what I heard,
you told me to stop.

28:30.324 --> 28:31.723
If I really
wanted you to stop,

28:31.725 --> 28:33.559
this is not how I would do it.

28:33.561 --> 28:35.427
I'm always helping you with
your flashes all the time.

28:35.429 --> 28:37.599
Did you ever stop
to think about that?

28:38.832 --> 28:41.733
No, I guess I hadn't
thought about that.

28:41.735 --> 28:43.036
Right, I've been helping you

28:43.038 --> 28:45.271
with your channel since day one.

28:45.273 --> 28:46.705
Okay, well if it's not you,

28:46.707 --> 28:48.508
then who's trying
to sabotage me?

28:48.510 --> 28:50.209
I think the better
question would be how did

28:50.211 --> 28:52.811
this person get into
your room to film this?

28:52.813 --> 28:53.980
Should we call the cops?

28:53.982 --> 28:55.048
Yes, I'll call.

28:55.050 --> 28:55.982
No, no, no, no.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.649
What do you mean, no, no, no?

28:57.651 --> 28:59.652
I should call, it's
my underwear and I don't

28:59.654 --> 29:01.486
want you to make it sound
unsexy or something.

29:01.488 --> 29:02.355
Really?

29:02.357 --> 29:03.556
Yeah, really.

29:03.558 --> 29:05.258
Fine, you make
the call, but do it!

29:05.260 --> 29:07.762
Okay.

29:08.629 --> 29:10.128
Um, the number is 911.

29:10.130 --> 29:12.030
I'm getting there, Emma.

29:14.468 --> 29:16.836
This is my new roommate Emma.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.540
We just moved in together today.

29:19.541 --> 29:20.906
I met her on the Str33ker forums

29:20.908 --> 29:22.709
and we love all the same things.

29:22.711 --> 29:24.042
Also, we're both
beautiful and smart.

29:33.120 --> 29:36.358
What's going on?

29:39.994 --> 29:42.664
Alright, looks like
the coast is clear.

29:43.798 --> 29:46.965
Yes, thanks for your bravery.

29:46.967 --> 29:48.268
All in the line of duty.

29:49.937 --> 29:51.838
Haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

29:51.840 --> 29:54.240
I don't know,
were you in 'Nam?

29:54.242 --> 29:55.441
What?

29:55.443 --> 29:56.876
No.

29:56.878 --> 29:58.980
Neither was I, so we
probably didn't meet there.

29:59.914 --> 30:02.447
Um, okay, not important.

30:02.449 --> 30:03.649
Look somebody broke...

30:03.651 --> 30:04.450
Look, guys I gotta
take a breather,

30:04.452 --> 30:05.917
I gotta take a breather.

30:05.919 --> 30:08.322
Come fill me in, alright,
just come fill me in.

30:13.628 --> 30:15.828
Somebody broke into our
apartment and made a video

30:15.830 --> 30:17.496
while we were on
campus for class.

30:17.498 --> 30:19.866
A flash, a flash,
it's called a flash.

30:19.868 --> 30:21.600
- A flash?
- Yeah.

30:21.602 --> 30:22.734
What?

30:22.736 --> 30:23.571
A flash.

30:25.005 --> 30:26.271
A video.

30:26.273 --> 30:27.773
Whatever, someone came
in and played 52 pickup

30:27.775 --> 30:30.576
with my underwear, which
is very sexy, I might add.

30:30.578 --> 30:32.110
Write that down,
write that down.

30:32.112 --> 30:34.379
He doesn't care if your
underwear is sexy or not.

30:34.381 --> 30:36.982
Look, I am here to get to
the bottom of this, I mean.

30:36.984 --> 30:41.889
Um, you have some,
um, on your hat.

30:43.390 --> 30:45.390
Oh, so I do.

30:45.392 --> 30:47.894
Look, I'm here to
gather clues, okay?

30:47.896 --> 30:49.962
If the underwear
being sexy is a clue,

30:49.964 --> 30:51.563
I need to know about it.

30:51.565 --> 30:55.568
It's not a clue really,
Bailey has a stalker.

30:55.570 --> 30:56.536
I'm sure this is the first time

30:56.538 --> 30:58.236
the stalker saw her underwear.

30:58.238 --> 30:59.338
Are you sure?

30:59.340 --> 31:01.941
I don't display my underwear.

31:01.943 --> 31:04.743
Very well, you
know this may be

31:04.745 --> 31:06.945
some kind of a desperate attempt

31:06.947 --> 31:09.382
to get a closer look
at your underwear,

31:09.384 --> 31:12.819
by some kind of a
pervert or something.

31:12.821 --> 31:16.021
I think that's the kind of
thing perverts are into.

31:16.023 --> 31:19.959
Yes, perverts, I think
we've made that clear.

31:19.961 --> 31:22.595
Bailey has a stalker.

31:22.597 --> 31:24.830
Can't you dust for
fingerprints or something?

31:24.832 --> 31:26.132
Anyone ever tell
you to smile more?

31:26.134 --> 31:27.366
Smile?

31:27.368 --> 31:28.501
Our apartment just
got broken into,

31:28.503 --> 31:30.069
and you want me to smile?

31:30.071 --> 31:31.872
Well, I mean...

31:33.041 --> 31:34.973
Can't you dust
for fingerprints?

31:34.975 --> 31:36.642
Fingerprints?

31:36.644 --> 31:40.749
Yes, um, I just need my
fingerprints kit from the car.

31:42.149 --> 31:44.450
You know, I would
dust for fingerprints,

31:44.452 --> 31:45.818
I just don't think fingerprints

31:45.820 --> 31:48.186
are gonna show up on underwear.

31:48.188 --> 31:50.123
You know, I'm actually
kinda new to this part.

31:50.125 --> 31:51.357
This is actually my first case.

31:51.359 --> 31:53.225
First case?

31:53.227 --> 31:56.596
Yeah well, I had a
desk job before, kind of.

31:56.598 --> 31:59.598
But, I never dusted underwear

31:59.600 --> 32:02.234
or anything else,
for fingerprints.

32:02.236 --> 32:04.872
I don't want dust all over
my underwear anyway, so.

32:07.509 --> 32:10.242
Look, you say
you're in college?

32:10.244 --> 32:12.411
Right, I'm gonna
chalk this one up to

32:12.413 --> 32:15.248
a stupid prank among
college students.

32:15.250 --> 32:17.215
Somebody broke
into our apartment,

32:17.217 --> 32:18.684
this is your first case...

32:18.686 --> 32:20.252
Yeah, yeah, look, was there
any sign of forced entry?

32:20.254 --> 32:21.087
No, but...

32:21.089 --> 32:22.355
Was anything stolen?

32:22.357 --> 32:24.357
No, all my sexy
underwear is here.

32:24.359 --> 32:29.364
Alright, take my card,
it's got my direct line.

32:30.231 --> 32:31.463
You notice anything missing,

32:31.465 --> 32:33.933
anything else out of
the ordinary happens,

32:33.935 --> 32:36.702
don't hesitate to
call me, don't wait.

32:36.704 --> 32:38.406
For now, there's
nothing I can do.

32:39.808 --> 32:43.475
Do you want me to take your
underwear into evidence?

32:43.477 --> 32:45.677
No, I'll hold onto
that, thank you though.

32:45.679 --> 32:47.180
Yeah, what if she wants to run

32:47.182 --> 32:48.446
for President some
day or something?

32:48.448 --> 32:49.816
Emma, this country
is never gonna let

32:49.818 --> 32:52.052
a woman even mention
underwear, be President.

32:53.353 --> 32:55.954
Look, I'm sorry
I couldn't do more.

32:55.956 --> 32:57.690
It's okay, don't
worry about it.

32:57.692 --> 33:00.158
Yeah, thanks for coming by.

33:00.160 --> 33:03.495
No problem, look, you
girls stay safe, okay?

33:03.497 --> 33:05.463
Make sure to look that
door and do something

33:05.465 --> 33:08.367
you like to keep your
mind off of this.

33:08.369 --> 33:10.237
Laughter is really
the best medicine.

33:21.182 --> 33:24.916
We're not sick!

33:24.918 --> 33:26.051
The following flash has been

33:26.053 --> 33:28.553
brought to you by toot strudels,

33:28.555 --> 33:31.156
the official toaster
pastry of str33ker.

33:31.158 --> 33:34.159
There's froot in every toot.

33:34.161 --> 33:35.627
Froot contains no
flavors, colors, pulp,

33:35.629 --> 33:37.530
or other natural derivatives
of fruits or vegetables.

33:37.532 --> 33:38.630
Hey guys, you're
watching Brayden's

33:38.632 --> 33:41.733
str33ker workout video, oh yeah!

33:59.052 --> 34:01.087
Oh yeah!

34:54.174 --> 34:59.179
Emma, Emma, Emma,

35:00.581 --> 35:05.284
Emma, Emma!

35:05.286 --> 35:06.485
What is it?

35:06.487 --> 35:08.286
Can you sleep with
me tonight, I'm scared.

35:08.288 --> 35:12.192
Fine.

35:29.444 --> 35:31.811
What the?

35:31.813 --> 35:34.315
Emma, are you dreaming again?

35:38.719 --> 35:41.555
What?

38:22.250 --> 38:26.253
I'm thirsty, I'm gonna
get something to drink.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.905
So let me get this straight.

39:20.907 --> 39:22.608
The man came back
and attacked you?

39:22.610 --> 39:25.076
You watched the video.

39:25.078 --> 39:27.212
Yeah, well, I'm not
totally sure what I saw,

39:27.214 --> 39:29.047
it's kinda dark, but uh,

39:29.049 --> 39:32.016
he didn't hurt you,
and instead ran off?

39:32.018 --> 39:34.152
Well, yeah, yeah.

39:34.154 --> 39:35.055
And you're okay?

39:36.190 --> 39:38.389
Not emotionally, but...

39:38.391 --> 39:40.194
Nothing's been stolen?

39:41.362 --> 39:44.829
No, but officer,
he tried to grab me.

39:44.831 --> 39:49.567
Fine, fine, look the
best I can offer is,

39:49.569 --> 39:51.369
I'll station myself
outside the building,

39:51.371 --> 39:53.074
and I'll keep an
eye on the place.

39:55.342 --> 39:57.610
I'm calling someone else!

39:57.612 --> 40:01.012
Officer could you just give
us like, one minute please?

40:01.014 --> 40:03.882
Sure, but don't
call someone else,

40:03.884 --> 40:05.253
I'm the guy, okay?

40:07.788 --> 40:11.690
Um, would you mind just like,
stepping out for a second?

40:11.692 --> 40:13.494
Right, yeah.

40:14.962 --> 40:16.161
Look, I know he's
a little weird.

40:16.163 --> 40:17.630
A little weird?!

40:17.632 --> 40:18.566
Shh, Emma, shh.

40:19.699 --> 40:20.632
A little weird?

40:20.634 --> 40:22.601
He has no idea what he's doing.

40:22.603 --> 40:23.835
Okay, but didn't he say it was

40:23.837 --> 40:25.971
like his first
case or something?

40:25.973 --> 40:27.172
I'm right here if you need me.

40:27.174 --> 40:28.940
Yep, just one
more minute, please.

40:28.942 --> 40:30.977
Yep, yep, yep, good, thanks.

40:32.045 --> 40:33.512
See?

40:33.514 --> 40:35.583
Okay, but it's his first
case, we can't get him fired.

40:36.884 --> 40:38.250
I'm a little
bit more concerned

40:38.252 --> 40:39.652
about one of us ending up dead,

40:39.654 --> 40:40.819
than him getting fired.

40:40.821 --> 40:43.655
Emma, relax, alright?

40:43.657 --> 40:45.958
Besides, that flash of you
almost getting kidnapped,

40:45.960 --> 40:48.626
has 20 million views and
a perfect bolt score.

40:48.628 --> 40:49.895
What!

40:49.897 --> 40:52.667
You're so popular,
Emma, like so popular.

40:54.335 --> 40:56.802
What the hell
is wrong with you?

40:56.804 --> 40:59.404
You're almost as
popular as I am.

40:59.406 --> 41:03.041
Great, just great.

41:03.043 --> 41:04.842
Just give him one more chance.

41:04.844 --> 41:06.078
One more, please?

41:06.080 --> 41:06.980
Fine!

41:08.181 --> 41:10.882
But I am not happy about this.

41:10.884 --> 41:13.486
Guys, I'm uh,
still right here.

41:15.022 --> 41:17.056
Officer, thank you so much,

41:17.058 --> 41:19.190
we really, really
appreciate this.

41:19.192 --> 41:20.726
Don't mention it.

41:20.728 --> 41:23.862
Look, I'll just be right out
here in the unmarked white van,

41:23.864 --> 41:26.197
so just call if you need me,
and I'll come running right up.

41:26.199 --> 41:28.032
Got hearing like an elephant.

41:28.034 --> 41:30.902
Aren't elephants more
known for their memory?

41:30.904 --> 41:32.170
What'd you say?

41:32.172 --> 41:33.006
Never mind.

41:36.944 --> 41:39.480
That guy is a complete loon.

41:40.581 --> 41:44.752
Our lives are in his hands.

41:45.618 --> 41:47.820
Great, just great.

41:47.822 --> 41:49.688
Come on, I want to
go buy some pretzels.

41:49.690 --> 41:50.521
Now?

41:50.523 --> 41:51.757
Yeah, I'm hungry.

41:51.759 --> 41:54.293
Fine, I'll get
us some knives too.

41:54.295 --> 41:56.094
Why not guns?

41:56.096 --> 41:58.364
I would never shoot anyone.

41:58.366 --> 42:00.167
But you would stab them?

42:02.036 --> 42:03.601
Well, no.

42:03.603 --> 42:05.904
What if someone
were hurting you?

42:05.906 --> 42:09.907
I'd ask them politely to
stop until they stopped.

42:09.909 --> 42:12.043
And you think that would work?

42:12.045 --> 42:13.277
Sure.

42:13.279 --> 42:14.346
- Because you're cute.
- Because I'm cute.

42:14.348 --> 42:15.547
Oh my...

42:15.549 --> 42:16.815
And what if someone
were hurting me?

42:16.817 --> 42:18.550
I'd ask them politely to...

42:18.552 --> 42:19.684
Keep going?

42:20.955 --> 42:22.353
Probably, yeah.

42:22.355 --> 42:23.454
Cute.

42:23.456 --> 42:25.157
I am cute.

42:25.159 --> 42:26.991
Remember that one time
you couldn't even kill

42:26.993 --> 42:28.761
that mouse that was
caught in a trap.

42:28.763 --> 42:31.396
I couldn't kill
it, it was so cute.

42:31.398 --> 42:34.532
It was suffering, you just
want to let it die slowly?

42:34.534 --> 42:36.869
I told you, I cannot
kill a living thing.

42:36.871 --> 42:38.103
Oh my god.

42:38.105 --> 42:39.404
I couldn't then,
and I can't now.

42:42.610 --> 42:46.147
How To Eat Like A
Lady With Mrs. Wilson.

42:47.614 --> 42:51.217
Here it comes, mmm,

42:53.186 --> 42:54.087
yum, mmhmm.

42:55.656 --> 42:58.692
Mm mm mm so good mmhmm,

43:00.460 --> 43:02.027
that's it.

43:02.029 --> 43:03.397
Great job, mmhmm.

43:04.931 --> 43:09.235
This has been How To Eat
Like A Lady With Mrs. Wilson.

43:10.337 --> 43:11.172
That's me!

43:25.685 --> 43:27.453
I'm really worried.

43:27.455 --> 43:30.221
You've been really worried
for the past 21 years.

43:30.223 --> 43:31.956
I'm only 20.

43:31.958 --> 43:33.592
Yeah, you were
worried in the womb.

43:33.594 --> 43:35.092
You were conceived and
you started worrying

43:35.094 --> 43:37.029
before you even
divided into two cells.

43:37.031 --> 43:38.663
Very funny.

43:38.665 --> 43:41.032
It's not a joke,
your first cell

43:41.034 --> 43:42.500
was probably an adrenal cell,

43:42.502 --> 43:46.003
and then you started producing
cortisol before mitosis.

43:46.005 --> 43:49.174
I thought you didn't
study for biology class.

43:49.176 --> 43:50.641
Kinky people.

43:50.643 --> 43:52.744
It's not related to cortisol.

43:52.746 --> 43:55.648
I know, but it seems to get
you really stressed out, so.

43:57.351 --> 44:00.384
At least we have our new
doppelgänger knives now.

44:00.386 --> 44:01.920
So, which one of
us is evil, then?

44:01.922 --> 44:03.422
Huh?

44:03.424 --> 44:06.291
A doppelgänger means an
evil mirror image of a person,

44:06.293 --> 44:08.659
so, one of us has to be evil.

44:08.661 --> 44:10.829
I mean, I guess it
has to be me, because.

44:10.831 --> 44:12.833
I think I'm the evil one.

44:13.868 --> 44:16.168
You, Miss Goody-two-shoes?

44:16.170 --> 44:17.369
Evil?

44:17.371 --> 44:18.839
You don't know
what's in my heart.

44:20.040 --> 44:21.639
I'm sure a heart
full of darkness,

44:21.641 --> 44:25.444
just waiting to show me your
true self at any moment.

44:25.446 --> 44:27.311
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

44:27.313 --> 44:29.884
Really though, you
drive me crazy.

44:31.217 --> 44:33.018
You are one of the smartest
people I know and...

44:33.020 --> 44:34.619
What?

44:34.621 --> 44:36.221
Well, you don't care.

44:36.223 --> 44:37.188
Why should I care?

44:37.190 --> 44:38.924
No one cares if I'm smart,

44:38.926 --> 44:41.058
all they care about is
if I'm making funny faces

44:41.060 --> 44:42.895
while I'm interviewing
Hollywood's weirdest,

44:42.897 --> 44:45.998
or if I'm making a makeup
tutorial or something.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.232
Doesn't that bother you?

44:47.234 --> 44:50.168
No, that's your problem, Emma.

44:50.170 --> 44:51.904
You think too small,

44:51.906 --> 44:53.971
you think that you need
to follow the rules.

44:53.973 --> 44:55.607
You think that there
even are rules,

44:55.609 --> 44:58.543
and no one cares
about rules, only you.

44:58.545 --> 45:02.146
Fine, I guess I'll loosen
up a little bit then.

45:02.148 --> 45:03.348
Now we're talking.

45:03.350 --> 45:05.219
Here, have a pretzel.

45:08.656 --> 45:09.587
Good, right?

45:09.589 --> 45:10.723
Mm yeah, it's pretty good.

45:11.891 --> 45:14.125
Maybe we should
go to class now.

45:14.127 --> 45:15.860
Dressed like this?

45:15.862 --> 45:18.264
No one cares, and we're
dissecting people today.

45:19.299 --> 45:20.732
Oooo.

45:20.734 --> 45:24.505
Once the blood is
drained from the cadaver,

45:27.273 --> 45:31.712
and is preserved
with embalming fluid,

45:36.150 --> 45:39.552
the body remains
completely flexible

45:40.621 --> 45:42.954
and intact.

45:42.956 --> 45:45.857
Smells a little like vinegar,
doesn't it?

45:47.627 --> 45:51.596
And ba bum bum!

45:52.433 --> 45:53.599
The heart.

45:53.601 --> 45:54.435
Awesome.

46:07.114 --> 46:10.583
I guess Emma wanted to
get a slightly closer look.

46:11.618 --> 46:12.619
Take five.

46:15.688 --> 46:20.694
Emma, Emma, Emma.

46:21.295 --> 46:21.960
Hi Bailey.

46:21.962 --> 46:23.395
Do you mind?

46:23.397 --> 46:24.998
Uh, I'm sorry.

46:26.333 --> 46:27.165
Ohh.

46:27.167 --> 46:28.333
You okay?

46:28.335 --> 46:29.400
What happened?

46:29.402 --> 46:31.335
Oof, long story, dude.

46:31.337 --> 46:32.570
No, I'm just kidding,

46:32.572 --> 46:33.505
it's actually not a
long story at all.

46:33.507 --> 46:35.206
Uh, you fainted and fell face

46:35.208 --> 46:36.974
first into a dead
person's abdomen.

46:36.976 --> 46:41.982
Ohh, I hate when
that happens.

46:42.850 --> 46:43.815
The following flash has been

46:43.817 --> 46:46.284
brought to you by toot strudels.

46:46.286 --> 46:48.887
The official toaster
pastry of str33ker.

46:48.889 --> 46:51.822
There's froot in every toot.

46:51.824 --> 46:53.291
Froot contains no
flavors, colors, pulp,

46:53.293 --> 46:54.659
or other natural derivatives
of fruits or vegetables.

46:56.730 --> 46:57.962
Hi!

46:57.964 --> 46:59.530
Do you ever wake up in
the morning, think boy,

46:59.532 --> 47:02.166
I wish I could
poop, but I can't.

47:02.168 --> 47:03.300
I drank a whole gallon of coffee

47:03.302 --> 47:04.703
and it's just not coming out.

47:04.705 --> 47:07.005
Not anymore with toot strudels.

47:07.007 --> 47:08.306
It'll make your bowels so soft,

47:08.308 --> 47:10.108
it'll just flow
right out your butt,

47:10.110 --> 47:11.375
straight in the toilet.

47:11.377 --> 47:12.476
I don't even have
to wait sometimes.

47:12.478 --> 47:13.712
Sometimes I'm rushing out there

47:13.714 --> 47:15.313
and I'm already turtling.

47:15.315 --> 47:17.849
Toots strudels, comes
in new three flavors:

47:17.851 --> 47:21.219
strawberry, watermelon,
and also cat flavor.

47:21.221 --> 47:24.489
Toot strudels, get it
out while it's in there.

47:24.491 --> 47:25.956
♪ Drop drop drop ♪

47:25.958 --> 47:27.659
♪ Hear the sound in the toilet ♪

47:27.661 --> 47:31.329
♪ Toot strudels will make
you poop like a baby ♪

47:31.331 --> 47:32.533
Toot strudels.

48:08.268 --> 48:10.469
I think I'm gonna take
a nap when I go inside.

48:10.471 --> 48:12.503
Yeah.

48:12.505 --> 48:13.938
Boo!

48:13.940 --> 48:14.973
Fucking Christ, Brayden,
are you kidding me?

48:14.975 --> 48:16.273
I'm just messing with you.

48:16.275 --> 48:17.509
Thought you were into
that kind of stuff

48:17.511 --> 48:18.677
now with your new
horror channel.

48:18.679 --> 48:19.945
I got this new camera.

48:19.947 --> 48:21.645
That's not horror,
Brayden, it's real.

48:21.647 --> 48:23.148
People are actually
breaking into your place?

48:23.150 --> 48:25.616
C'mon, I'm not dumb
enough to believe that.

48:25.618 --> 48:27.119
Thought we can go out sometime?

48:27.121 --> 48:29.755
Now you wanna go out, now
that I'm back on a str33k?

48:29.757 --> 48:30.989
Well, yeah.

48:30.991 --> 48:34.726
Oh my god, thanks for
the rose, by the way.

48:34.728 --> 48:36.230
See you later, Brayden.

48:59.920 --> 49:03.557
Wow, Brayden really
likes to stomp on things.

49:04.792 --> 49:06.391
That makes me feel
a little bit better

49:06.393 --> 49:08.362
about fainting into
that dead body.

49:10.130 --> 49:13.100
That's the worst thing that
could have ever happened.

49:14.601 --> 49:16.737
Talk about falling
for someone heartless.

49:19.806 --> 49:20.640
Get it?

49:23.810 --> 49:25.976
I'm still worried.

49:25.978 --> 49:27.878
Don't be, Officer
Dobson's right outside,

49:27.880 --> 49:29.346
and he has a gun.

49:29.348 --> 49:31.016
Does he have a gun, though?

49:31.018 --> 49:32.483
I didn't see one.

49:32.485 --> 49:35.353
I'm not even sure if
he has a real badge.

49:35.355 --> 49:37.322
He didn't even notice
Brayden coming up.

49:37.324 --> 49:39.157
Well, they probably
gave them one

49:39.159 --> 49:40.558
of those plastic
badges and no gun

49:40.560 --> 49:42.328
until after their
first assignment.

49:43.730 --> 49:45.365
Anyway, I'm sure it's fine.

49:47.967 --> 49:50.367
Anyway, we should
go to bed, dude.

49:50.369 --> 49:52.103
I'd say we have to
do some flashes,

49:52.105 --> 49:53.971
but this one of you
getting kidnapped

49:53.973 --> 49:57.041
is str33king up
the charts, what.

49:57.043 --> 49:58.244
What about Laura?

49:59.679 --> 50:04.215
Her first chemo flash is
third after the kidnapping,

50:04.217 --> 50:05.953
and the underwear toss, what?

50:06.853 --> 50:09.721
The sexy underwear toss.

50:09.723 --> 50:12.190
Yes, Emma, I
taught you so well.

50:12.192 --> 50:13.627
Alright, let's go to bed.

50:15.696 --> 50:17.362
No prayers tonight?

50:17.364 --> 50:19.965
Nah, I'm already
feeling as confident

50:19.967 --> 50:21.235
as a mediocre white man.

50:23.203 --> 50:26.270
I wish I could be as
confident as Dobson.

50:26.272 --> 50:28.405
He's pretty damn mediocre.

50:28.407 --> 50:29.409
He sure is.

50:32.212 --> 50:34.414
I could solve this
case as well as he can.

50:35.449 --> 50:36.850
Well, I'm counting on you.

50:37.717 --> 50:38.518
Great.

50:40.152 --> 50:44.023
Well, I gotta go to bed,
I'm totally frazzled.

50:45.424 --> 50:46.225
Good night.

50:48.027 --> 50:48.828
Good night.

50:53.667 --> 50:56.867
Being creepy
sure brings out my hunger.

50:56.869 --> 51:00.038
Crouching in the bushes all
night making you peckish?

51:00.040 --> 51:01.840
When I'm outside
someone's window,

51:01.842 --> 51:04.141
filming them without
their consent,

51:04.143 --> 51:05.744
I make sure they've got a box

51:05.746 --> 51:07.878
of toot strudels ready
in their kitchen.

51:07.880 --> 51:11.049
When I need a break, I
just force open their door,

51:11.051 --> 51:13.985
tiptoe through the
house and grab a snack.

51:13.987 --> 51:16.387
Nothing like a
self-heating toaster pastry

51:16.389 --> 51:18.223
to give you energy to stay up

51:18.225 --> 51:20.525
all night watching
someone sleep.

51:20.527 --> 51:23.695
With patented radioactive
isotope technology,

51:23.697 --> 51:25.529
they help me stay warm
on chilly damp nights

51:25.531 --> 51:28.032
when I'm lurking in the shadows.

51:28.034 --> 51:29.867
Toot strudels,
the favorite snack

51:29.869 --> 51:31.737
food of night
creepers everywhere.

51:33.139 --> 51:37.076
Well, all's quiet here,
time for a little meditation.

56:23.330 --> 56:28.335
Shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh.

56:34.373 --> 56:36.107
I woke up and
walked out of my room.

56:36.109 --> 56:38.308
The whole house
smelled like vinegar.

56:38.310 --> 56:41.112
I figured maybe Bailey
was cleaning or something,

56:41.114 --> 56:42.813
but she was gone.

56:42.815 --> 56:44.849
I thought maybe she
went for a walk,

56:44.851 --> 56:46.617
but then I received a text,

56:46.619 --> 56:48.418
I ran out right away to get you.

56:48.420 --> 56:49.820
Did you not hear anything?

56:49.822 --> 56:51.723
Yeah, it turns out that
my elephant hearing,

56:51.725 --> 56:54.625
not quite so keen and
fast when I'm asleep.

56:54.627 --> 56:56.326
What the hell
are we going to do?

56:56.328 --> 56:58.563
I mean, did you
try calling her?

56:58.565 --> 57:00.030
Yes, of course.

57:00.032 --> 57:01.532
And?

57:01.534 --> 57:04.067
No answer, look, somebody
broke into our apartment,

57:04.069 --> 57:07.804
not once, but twice,
it was not a prank!

57:07.806 --> 57:09.806
You were supposed to be
out there protecting us.

57:09.808 --> 57:12.309
He attacked me and
he kidnapped Bailey.

57:12.311 --> 57:13.244
Aaahh!

57:13.246 --> 57:15.313
Fucking do something about it!

57:15.315 --> 57:18.215
Do you have any leads at all?

57:18.217 --> 57:20.150
Aren't you the detective?

57:20.152 --> 57:21.786
I suppose I am, I mean,

57:21.788 --> 57:24.389
that's what it says
on my badge, anyway.

57:24.391 --> 57:26.056
You know, I can't place it,

57:26.058 --> 57:27.858
but you really
remind me of someone.

57:27.860 --> 57:30.460
I look like
a lot of people, okay?

57:30.462 --> 57:33.132
Any leads, anything?

57:35.034 --> 57:37.837
I mean, Bailey
had a lot of fans,

57:39.005 --> 57:40.773
I don't think she
had any enemies.

57:42.208 --> 57:45.476
Come to think of it, she
did have a lot of enemies.

57:45.478 --> 57:47.045
Like who?

57:47.047 --> 57:51.449
That Chase guy,
Brayden, our professor,

57:51.451 --> 57:54.518
just about everyone
loves and hates Bailey.

57:54.520 --> 57:56.119
It's her thing, I guess.

57:56.121 --> 57:57.424
What about you?

57:59.491 --> 58:02.326
Nobody notices or
cares about me, really.

58:02.328 --> 58:07.130
No, no, no, I mean, don't
you love and hate Bailey?

58:07.132 --> 58:09.800
How do I know you're
not a suspect?

58:09.802 --> 58:10.603
Really?

58:12.205 --> 58:14.973
Yeah, I guess we can go ahead
and cross you off the list.

58:15.808 --> 58:16.810
What about you?

58:17.911 --> 58:18.842
Me?

58:18.844 --> 58:19.678
Sure.

58:21.614 --> 58:23.983
We can go ahead and
cross me off the list too.

58:25.451 --> 58:28.119
Great, just about eight
billion more people to go,

58:28.121 --> 58:29.454
until we find the kidnapper.

58:29.456 --> 58:30.355
Or killer.

58:30.357 --> 58:31.621
What?

58:31.623 --> 58:33.090
I mean, we just don't
know, she could be dead.

58:33.092 --> 58:36.059
What the hell kind of
detective school did you go to?

58:36.061 --> 58:37.261
You don't just tell people that

58:37.263 --> 58:38.962
their missing friends
might be dead.

58:38.964 --> 58:40.630
Yeah, I guess I missed
that day in class.

58:40.632 --> 58:42.000
Yeah, apparently.

58:43.235 --> 58:46.003
This whole apartment
smells like vinegar.

58:46.005 --> 58:49.574
Vinegar, you sure it's
not just chloroform?

58:49.576 --> 58:51.442
Well, what does
chloroform smell like?

58:51.444 --> 58:54.612
It, uh, smells exactly
like vinegar, yeah.

58:54.614 --> 58:56.813
Well then, there you have it.

58:58.650 --> 59:00.986
Hey, could I see your notebook?

59:03.123 --> 59:05.525
Um, sure.

59:11.063 --> 59:12.896
Yup, well, I'm gonna
have to get going,

59:12.898 --> 59:14.699
gotta get back on the case.

59:14.701 --> 59:15.766
You should be okay, you know,

59:15.768 --> 59:17.101
since nobody really notices you

59:17.103 --> 59:18.405
or cares about you at all.

59:19.406 --> 59:21.471
Thanks, I guess.

59:21.473 --> 59:24.676
Just please promise me
that you'll find Bailey.

59:25.844 --> 59:28.311
I know that she's
an idiot sometimes,

59:28.313 --> 59:32.849
but she's really my only friend.

59:32.851 --> 59:35.487
Yeah, I
promise I'll do my best.

59:41.326 --> 59:45.898
It just doesn't add up,
I didn't hear anything.

59:47.266 --> 59:49.335
Officer Dobson
didn't hear anything.

59:54.373 --> 59:56.842
What does chloroform smell like?

01:00:08.587 --> 01:00:09.520
Aaaahh!

01:00:09.522 --> 01:00:11.188
Whoa, easy there, relax!

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:13.357
What have you
done with Bailey?!

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:14.592
What?

01:00:14.594 --> 01:00:15.826
Nothing, I just came
to help her study.

01:00:15.828 --> 01:00:16.960
Dr. Vargas wanted
me to tutor her.

01:00:16.962 --> 01:00:18.929
Then why are you breaking in?

01:00:18.931 --> 01:00:20.030
Breaking in?

01:00:20.032 --> 01:00:21.364
I knocked and no one answered,

01:00:21.366 --> 01:00:22.632
and I saw the door was open,

01:00:22.634 --> 01:00:24.101
so I figured I'd see
if anyone was home.

01:00:24.103 --> 01:00:27.440
a
little bit creepy, no?

01:00:29.107 --> 01:00:31.208
Yeah, I guess
you're right, sorry,

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:33.945
I'm just not too used
to being around people.

01:00:33.947 --> 01:00:35.413
Uh, do you think
maybe you could,

01:00:35.415 --> 01:00:36.715
like, put that thing down?

01:00:37.951 --> 01:00:40.985
I guess so, but
one false move and...

01:00:40.987 --> 01:00:42.820
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:00:42.822 --> 01:00:44.791
Alright, I just came
over to see Bailey.

01:00:45.757 --> 01:00:47.326
She's not here.

01:00:48.795 --> 01:00:51.094
Well, can you let her know
I stopped by or something?

01:00:51.096 --> 01:00:52.929
I can't.

01:00:52.931 --> 01:00:54.364
Why?

01:00:54.366 --> 01:00:57.336
Because she's been kidnapped
or murdered or worse.

01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:26.866
Oh my goodness, you're awake.

01:01:28.333 --> 01:01:30.534
You have no idea how long
I've waited for this day,

01:01:30.536 --> 01:01:32.504
now it's finally here.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.773
You know, I've followed your
work for sometime, Bailey.

01:01:36.775 --> 01:01:38.275
From the beginning, really.

01:01:38.277 --> 01:01:41.512
And I just knew if I could get
you alone in a room with me,

01:01:41.514 --> 01:01:43.316
we'd be best friends.

01:01:44.516 --> 01:01:48.518
But here we are
finally together,

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.654
just the two of us.

01:01:50.656 --> 01:01:52.723
I can feel the love in the
room already, can't you?

01:01:55.694 --> 01:01:58.397
Oh that's right, that's
right, you can't talk.

01:01:59.898 --> 01:02:02.465
Well, I'm awful sorry about
the accommodations, you see,

01:02:02.467 --> 01:02:04.902
my neighbors complain
about the loud music,

01:02:04.904 --> 01:02:07.871
who knows how they would feel
if they heard you screaming

01:02:07.873 --> 01:02:10.107
down here, you get it right?!

01:02:10.109 --> 01:02:12.143
Right?!

01:02:15.081 --> 01:02:20.086
Help me, help me!

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:30.293
No, no, no, that's
a very, very bad girl.

01:02:30.295 --> 01:02:32.598
We're supposed to have
fun together, remember?

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.634
I've worked very
hard to get you here,

01:02:36.636 --> 01:02:38.335
this is like a dream
come true for me,

01:02:38.337 --> 01:02:40.637
but if we can't
have fun together,

01:02:40.639 --> 01:02:43.109
well, there really is no
use for you, understand?

01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:45.078
Understand?

01:02:46.679 --> 01:02:49.215
Great, then let's
try this again.

01:02:50.516 --> 01:02:52.382
What do you want from me?

01:02:52.384 --> 01:02:54.851
I thought I made
that perfectly clear.

01:02:54.853 --> 01:02:57.054
I want you to be my friend,

01:02:57.056 --> 01:02:58.521
and we're gonna
hang out and make

01:02:58.523 --> 01:03:00.525
flashes for everyone out there.

01:03:02.094 --> 01:03:03.561
Flashes?

01:03:03.563 --> 01:03:06.630
Yeah, someone has gotta
continue your str33k.

01:03:06.632 --> 01:03:09.400
Like I said, I'm a
huge, longtime fan,

01:03:09.402 --> 01:03:10.668
and I just always
wanted to be in

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:13.039
the flashes together
with you as a team.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:18.009
If I make flashes with
you, you'll let me go?

01:03:18.011 --> 01:03:20.610
We'll see, we'll
see, but look,

01:03:20.612 --> 01:03:23.413
I've taken the liberty of
typing up a script for you.

01:03:23.415 --> 01:03:26.416
Now, I know normally you
improvise your flashes,

01:03:26.418 --> 01:03:28.152
but I really think it's better

01:03:28.154 --> 01:03:29.853
if we work from a
script to start.

01:03:29.855 --> 01:03:32.155
You see, I've got
this perfect idea

01:03:32.157 --> 01:03:34.190
in my mind of how
it's supposed to go,

01:03:34.192 --> 01:03:36.860
and if it doesn't
go just perfectly,

01:03:36.862 --> 01:03:38.829
I may have to make some cuts.

01:03:44.603 --> 01:03:49.609
Help me, help
me! Help!

01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:54.047
Well, at least she isn't dead.

01:03:56.882 --> 01:03:58.114
And this is the most viewed live

01:03:58.116 --> 01:03:59.819
str33k in the
history of str33ker.

01:04:01.319 --> 01:04:03.088
I've gotta call
Officer Dobson.

01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:11.762
The following flash has been

01:04:11.764 --> 01:04:14.230
brought to you by toot strudels,

01:04:14.232 --> 01:04:16.833
the official toaster
pastry of str33ker.

01:04:16.835 --> 01:04:19.804
There's froot in every toot.

01:04:19.806 --> 01:04:21.271
Froot contains no
flavors, colors, pulp,

01:04:21.273 --> 01:04:22.407
or other natural derivatives
of fruits or vegetables.

01:04:25.277 --> 01:04:27.413
This will be my
last flash ever.

01:04:30.917 --> 01:04:33.018
I just wanna say
thank you so much.

01:04:36.322 --> 01:04:39.058
I'm told I only have
hours left to live,

01:04:41.893 --> 01:04:45.931
my heart's giving out and
there's nothing anyone can do.

01:04:49.701 --> 01:04:51.036
I wish you all the best.

01:04:53.406 --> 01:04:58.311
I'm also hoping that
Bailey gets rescued safely.

01:05:00.846 --> 01:05:03.482
I'm rooting for you.

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:11.855
The start of the greatest
str33k in the history...

01:05:17.596 --> 01:05:19.197
Fucking telemarketers.

01:05:21.067 --> 01:05:22.699
You should really sign up
for the Do Not Call list.

01:05:22.701 --> 01:05:23.535
Shut up!

01:05:25.337 --> 01:05:26.737
You know, if you wanted
to be in one of my flashes,

01:05:26.739 --> 01:05:28.271
you could've just asked me.

01:05:28.273 --> 01:05:31.175
No, no, no, no, no,
you see, I tried that,

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:33.844
it's funny you should say
that, because boy did I try.

01:05:33.846 --> 01:05:35.179
I sent you a letter every week

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:36.447
telling you how much I loved you

01:05:36.449 --> 01:05:38.681
and wanted to be in
one of your flashes,

01:05:38.683 --> 01:05:40.050
but I never got a reply.

01:05:40.052 --> 01:05:41.518
I never got any...

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.954
Yeah, well, water under
the bridge now, right?

01:05:43.956 --> 01:05:46.623
We're here together now,
that's all that matters.

01:05:46.625 --> 01:05:50.661
And look, here's a rose
to show you my love.

01:05:50.663 --> 01:05:53.230
Ew freak, stop.

01:05:53.232 --> 01:05:54.934
Hey, that's not very ladylike.

01:05:57.435 --> 01:05:58.270
Fine.

01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:08.679
Well, everybody, our time
is just about up for today.

01:06:08.681 --> 01:06:12.882
But we'll be back in just
a few short hours tonight.

01:06:12.884 --> 01:06:16.020
Be sure to tune in for the
start of the grand finale,

01:06:16.022 --> 01:06:17.721
the beginning of
the greatest live

01:06:17.723 --> 01:06:20.025
str33k in the
history of str33king.

01:06:25.031 --> 01:06:28.833
I don't know why he's
not answering his phone.

01:06:31.203 --> 01:06:32.203
You've
reached the voicemail

01:06:32.205 --> 01:06:34.137
of Detective Frank Dobson, yeah,

01:06:34.139 --> 01:06:35.239
I can't come to the
phone right now.

01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:40.012
I'm calling 911, forget it.

01:06:50.723 --> 01:06:52.625
Do you think we
took this too far?

01:06:53.926 --> 01:06:56.226
I, I, I don't know, I'm
freaking out about this,

01:06:56.228 --> 01:06:58.128
and Emma's really
worried and I feel like

01:06:58.130 --> 01:06:59.996
people think this is
real or something.

01:06:59.998 --> 01:07:01.532
Oh, well, I hope
they think it's real,

01:07:01.534 --> 01:07:02.702
it's been great so far.

01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:07.237
I, I, I don't want to do this,

01:07:07.239 --> 01:07:08.806
I'm gonna call Emma.

01:07:08.808 --> 01:07:10.474
Don't you think
she's gonna be angry?

01:07:10.476 --> 01:07:12.009
No, it's Emma.

01:07:12.011 --> 01:07:13.143
She'll be annoyed at first,

01:07:13.145 --> 01:07:14.645
and she'll pretend not to care,

01:07:14.647 --> 01:07:17.380
but she cares about being
famous as much as I do.

01:07:17.382 --> 01:07:19.983
And she won't tell anybody
either, so don't worry.

01:07:19.985 --> 01:07:21.951
Well, I guess she's gonna
have to save you then.

01:07:21.953 --> 01:07:23.522
Yeah, but she can pretend.

01:07:24.991 --> 01:07:28.491
Listen Bailey, I mean it's
been real up to this point,

01:07:28.493 --> 01:07:31.262
but uh, I'm not just
gonna throw this away.

01:07:31.264 --> 01:07:34.697
We've come this far, I'm not
just gonna walk away from it.

01:07:34.699 --> 01:07:36.634
Well, I'm not going to do it.

01:07:36.636 --> 01:07:37.902
Yes, you fucking are!

01:07:37.904 --> 01:07:39.402
You fucking said you
would, you're here,

01:07:39.404 --> 01:07:41.038
we're here, we're
doing it, okay?!

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.940
We're doing it!

01:07:43.942 --> 01:07:47.511
Now just stop arguing
with me, I'm tired of it.

01:07:47.513 --> 01:07:49.045
We're going with the
plan we agreed on.

01:07:49.047 --> 01:07:50.782
Please I don't want to do it.

01:07:54.819 --> 01:07:57.387
Just shut up about that.

01:07:57.389 --> 01:07:58.922
I just need you to shut up,

01:07:58.924 --> 01:08:01.324
it's the last time I'm
gonna say it, okay?

01:08:01.326 --> 01:08:04.994
Just shut up and
let's finish it, okay?

01:08:04.996 --> 01:08:05.829
What, what, what
are you doing?

01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:07.096
Stop.

01:08:07.098 --> 01:08:08.301
What, why are you
making it tighter?

01:08:09.902 --> 01:08:14.907
Right, uh, I'm sorry,

01:08:15.641 --> 01:08:16.142
look, I'm really sorry.

01:08:17.243 --> 01:08:18.509
I just started freaking
out when I thought

01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:20.078
you were gonna back
out all of a sudden.

01:08:21.746 --> 01:08:23.011
It's okay, it's just I feel

01:08:23.014 --> 01:08:24.148
like this is
getting out of hand.

01:08:32.959 --> 01:08:34.524
Is that my real knife?

01:08:34.526 --> 01:08:36.961
Yeah, I just grabbed
it from your place.

01:08:36.962 --> 01:08:38.162
Oh my god, I'm not
gonna hurt you.

01:08:38.163 --> 01:08:39.563
You don't need to freak out

01:08:39.564 --> 01:08:41.064
or get all hysterical
or anything.

01:08:41.066 --> 01:08:42.599
My god, I just need
it to look convincing.

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:43.832
Alright, please,
please, please,

01:08:43.835 --> 01:08:46.002
just please don't cut
me with the knife, okay?

01:08:47.205 --> 01:08:48.604
Just put it away, please.

01:08:48.606 --> 01:08:50.341
Yeah, you don't need
to worry about it.

01:08:50.343 --> 01:08:51.506
Okay, but...

01:08:51.509 --> 01:08:53.111
Yeah, I have the
reflexes of an elephant.

01:10:15.895 --> 01:10:18.964
Toot strudels, awesome.

01:10:21.299 --> 01:10:22.668
Where the hell is Dobson?

01:10:24.837 --> 01:10:26.170
You've got to have seen
the guy who did this,

01:10:26.172 --> 01:10:27.306
at some point, right?

01:10:28.441 --> 01:10:30.843
I don't know, I
can't think of anyone.

01:10:31.776 --> 01:10:32.842
I mean, I guess at this point,

01:10:32.844 --> 01:10:34.944
it could be a lot of people.

01:10:34.946 --> 01:10:37.581
I even thought you
were a suspect.

01:10:37.583 --> 01:10:40.553
Me?

01:10:42.721 --> 01:10:44.621
What's so funny?

01:10:44.623 --> 01:10:46.924
That you thought I
could be a kidnapper.

01:10:46.926 --> 01:10:48.593
No, no, that's
not what I meant.

01:10:49.895 --> 01:10:54.667
What I meant was,
what's so funny?

01:10:57.069 --> 01:11:00.237
Sorry, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:11:00.239 --> 01:11:02.238
I think we need
to watch the video.

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.074
Which video?

01:11:04.509 --> 01:11:05.708
This is
like a dream come true for me,

01:11:06.945 --> 01:11:08.211
but if we can't
have fun together,

01:11:08.213 --> 01:11:11.081
well there really is no
use for you, understand?

01:11:11.083 --> 01:11:11.951
Now laugh.

01:11:13.919 --> 01:11:15.452
Ha ha.

01:11:15.454 --> 01:11:16.953
For real.

01:11:16.955 --> 01:11:18.788
Okay, why do people always
tell other people to laugh or

01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:19.756
smile?

01:11:19.758 --> 01:11:22.326
Laugh.

01:11:25.196 --> 01:11:26.863
Can't
have fun together,

01:11:26.865 --> 01:11:28.364
well there really
is no use for you.

01:11:30.768 --> 01:11:31.570
What's so funny?

01:11:33.172 --> 01:11:34.339
I know where Bailey is!

01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:32.309
The preceding film
has been brought

01:15:32.311 --> 01:15:34.277
to you by toot strudels.

01:15:34.279 --> 01:15:37.881
There's froot in every toot.

01:15:37.883 --> 01:15:39.716
Froot contains no
flavors, colors, pulp,

01:15:39.718 --> 01:15:42.354
or other natural derivatives
of fruits of vegetables.

01:19:10.227 --> 01:19:14.229
Helllllo Emma nation,
Emma world, Emma universe!

01:19:14.231 --> 01:19:16.632
We've been number
one for 13 weeks now,

01:19:16.634 --> 01:19:18.835
and I would like to
thank all of my fans

01:19:18.837 --> 01:19:21.604
with a tour of
Hollywood's Weirdest.

01:19:21.606 --> 01:19:25.475
I would also like to thank
my very tall roommate Bailey

01:19:25.477 --> 01:19:27.579
for helping us film today.

01:19:28.446 --> 01:19:31.780
Bailey is very, very serious.

01:19:31.782 --> 01:19:36.788
But underneath that sour exterior
is a very, very fun girl.

01:19:38.222 --> 01:19:41.056
And I think when Bailey
learns to smile and laugh,

01:19:41.058 --> 01:19:44.527
she'll be having just as
much fun as the rest of us!

01:19:45.630 --> 01:19:48.366
Bailey, smile for the camera!

01:19:48.851 --> 01:19:50.929
