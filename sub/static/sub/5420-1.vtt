that never ceased

18:05.166 --> 18:08.667
to irritate my grandmother.

not to say that she didn't
have her kind side.

In fact, when our maid Hildie
got cancer and had to have
her leg removed,

18:28.375 --> 18:30.500
Grandmother hired
two more maids,

18:30.500 --> 18:32.625

after Hildie.

Hildie never worked
another day in her life.

18:35.375 --> 18:38.458
And as the years went on,
she even began to look
like my grandmother,

18:38.458 --> 18:40.291
and not like a maid at all.

18:40.291 --> 18:42.041

is positively...

from your mom on the train.

of fact, Joe,

20:33.000 --> 20:35.959
this is something
that I bought for you.

My mother's dates were
always bringing me presents

what do you say?
Nice bag.

I tell you what.
Um, why don't
I take this

20:51.667 --> 20:55.000
and just put it
right over here
on this table.

take a look at it

on the bag for me.

if it moves.

Well, what I try and do,
Mrs. Wenteworth,

21:30.333 --> 21:33.166
is use the theater
to get students to
express themselves

21:33.166 --> 21:34.083
in ways they
normally couldn't.

21:35.083 --> 21:38.333
How do you do that?

21:38.333 --> 21:40.542
Well, one way that
I found works well
is by introducing props.

21:40.542 --> 21:41.417

to respond to that.

21:42.917 --> 21:45.417

I don't need
that many peas.

22:19.417 --> 22:20.875

What?

22:27.917 --> 22:31.083
Not unless it's
a dead puppy.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.041

bring a dead puppy
on the first date.

27:46.041 --> 27:50.542
a beautiful sweater
just for you.

27:50.542 --> 27:52.375
Hopefully, a good fit.

27:54.083 --> 27:56.458
So, let's see?

27:56.458 --> 27:59.917
Oops! (CHUCKLES)
Oh, my goodness.

27:59.917 --> 28:02.083
Well,

28:02.083 --> 28:05.291
what a very long
piece of yarn.

28:06.750 --> 28:09.250
He looks like
a hobo.
It's perfect.

28:09.250 --> 28:10.250
Just like you.

28:13.750 --> 28:15.125
Come on.

28:17.250 --> 28:20.083
As it is he
whose transgression
is forgiven

28:20.083 --> 28:22.709
whose sin is covered.

28:22.709 --> 28:25.291
I said I will confess
my transgressions
unto the Lord

28:25.291 --> 28:26.917
and Thou forgave us
the inequity of my sin.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.458
The Word of the Lord.
ALL: Thanks be to God.

28:33.667 --> 28:35.709
I'd like to take
a few minutes
to discuss some

28:35.709 --> 28:37.125
of the upcoming activities
on the church calendar.

28:38.208 --> 28:39.291
Here we go.

28:41.125 --> 28:42.667
What's wrong, Simon?

28:42.667 --> 28:45.333
Who knows what God thinks
about current events?

28:45.333 --> 28:46.542
Does someone have
a question?

28:46.542 --> 28:49.709
Uh, no, sir.

28:49.709 --> 28:51.333
Uh, Your Honor, no.

28:52.583 --> 28:57.000
Father, thank you.
No, sir.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.417
It's always nice
to see new faces
in the congregation.

29:00.792 --> 29:02.458
Uh, I'd like
to invite them

29:02.458 --> 29:05.208
to join my wife and children
and, uh, myself

29:05.208 --> 29:08.000
for coffee and donuts
downstairs after the service.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.458
What does coffee and donuts
have to do with God?

29:10.458 --> 29:13.166
Simon, you better be quiet.

29:13.166 --> 29:14.125
Simon, is there something
you'd like to share
with the rest of us?

29:19.333 --> 29:23.625
I said, "What does coffee
and donuts have to do
with God?"

29:23.625 --> 29:26.250
They're merely refreshments
so people can socialize

29:26.250 --> 29:29.166
and, uh, discuss
the upcoming activities.

29:29.166 --> 29:31.917
Whoever said that church needs
a continental breakfast?

29:31.917 --> 29:33.542
REVEREND RUSSELL: Simon!

29:33.542 --> 29:35.333
I doubt that God is interested
in our church activities.

29:35.333 --> 29:37.375
Simon!

29:37.375 --> 29:39.125
If God has made the church
bake sale our priority,

29:39.125 --> 29:41.500
then I'd say we're all
in a lot of trouble.

29:41.500 --> 29:42.625
Simon, that is enough!

29:49.792 --> 29:52.333
(GRUNTS)
Children may be excused

29:52.333 --> 29:53.375
to go to Sunday school.

29:55.208 --> 29:56.834
(SEETHING)

29:56.834 --> 29:58.667
MS. LEAVEY: Simon!
Yes, ma'am?

30:01.208 --> 30:03.750
Don't you feel that you owe
Reverend Russell an apology?

30:06.333 --> 30:08.083
Simon?

30:08.083 --> 30:09.792
I'm thinking.

30:09.792 --> 30:11.709
Well, you can just sit
there and think

30:11.709 --> 30:14.375
until you apologize
to poor Reverend Russell.

30:14.375 --> 30:15.583
Class dismissed.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.542
Joe, dismissed.

30:21.542 --> 30:22.709
See you later,
alligator.

30:22.709 --> 30:23.375
After a while, crocodile.

30:27.083 --> 30:29.417
Reverend Russell.
Go on outside, Joe.

30:29.417 --> 30:30.542
He didn't
mean anything.

30:30.542 --> 30:32.875
Stop making excuses for him.

30:32.875 --> 30:34.750
If Simon is going to be
a member of our congregation,

30:34.750 --> 30:36.458
he has to start behaving
like a normal person.

30:36.458 --> 30:37.750
He is a normal person.

30:37.750 --> 30:39.917
Simon Birch is not
a normal person.

30:43.333 --> 30:44.542
Just go on outside,
Joe.

30:49.792 --> 30:51.542
(SIGHING) Well...

30:54.583 --> 30:55.917
are we, uh, ready
to apologize?

30:57.250 --> 30:59.417
He's thinking
about it.

31:02.959 --> 31:04.250
Simon.

31:06.709 --> 31:07.709
What do you
think you're doing
sitting in a corner?

31:08.750 --> 31:11.125
Thinking about God.
In a corner?

31:12.583 --> 31:14.083
Faith is not
in a floor plan.

31:16.125 --> 31:17.250
(SIGHS)

31:23.834 --> 31:26.250
Keep him here.
But for how long?

31:28.583 --> 31:30.542
As long
as it takes.

31:30.542 --> 31:32.291
Mom.
Hi, honey.
Where's Simon?

31:35.792 --> 31:37.667
Didn't your mother
ever teach you

31:37.667 --> 31:39.166
how to keep quiet
during mass?

31:42.250 --> 31:45.500
Tsk. What am
I saying?

31:45.500 --> 31:46.792
Of course
she didn't.

31:51.125 --> 31:53.625
Your parents
don't go to church,
do they, Simon?

31:56.625 --> 31:58.583
See, that's because
they don't belong here.

32:01.333 --> 32:02.625
And neither do you.

32:04.458 --> 32:07.208
Speaking out of turn,
disrupting the class,

32:07.208 --> 32:10.000
telling the other children
that God has a special
plan for you.

32:11.291 --> 32:12.667
What kind of
nonsense is that?

32:14.792 --> 32:17.291
And what kind
of nonsense
is this?

32:17.291 --> 32:19.291
Hello, Rebecca.
Come on, Simon.

32:19.291 --> 32:21.000
I was just... No, wait.
I was...

32:21.000 --> 32:23.709
Out.
I was teaching him
a lesson.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.333
REBECCA: And what lesson
is that? Humiliation?

32:25.333 --> 32:27.041
Oh, man, this is so boss.

32:27.041 --> 32:28.834
This is all my fault.

32:28.834 --> 32:30.667
Hey, don't take all
the credit. She's my mom.

32:30.667 --> 32:33.166
Telling the children
that he's some kind
of hero. That he's...

32:33.166 --> 32:37.041
That he's God's instrument.
And who's to say he isn't?

32:37.041 --> 32:39.000
Who do you think
would win in a fight?
Good question.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.750
Miss Leavey is meaner,
but she's a smoker.

32:40.750 --> 32:42.583
Your mom could outlast her.

32:42.583 --> 32:44.208
We can't have him
talking that way.

32:45.291 --> 32:47.166
It frightens
the other children.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.792
Oh, I think it's you
it frightens, Miss Leavey.

32:49.792 --> 32:53.208
What?
Why would I be frightened
of little Simon Birch?

32:53.208 --> 32:56.875
Because that child
has more faith than
you'll ever know.

32:56.875 --> 32:57.917
BOTH: Ahh!
Oh, goodness gracious.

33:00.375 --> 33:01.417
Come on, you two.

33:06.542 --> 33:08.208

Let's go find Ben.

Oh, that's okay, Simon.
I'll get it for you.

33:27.583 --> 33:28.875
Thank you,
Miss Wenteworth.

Thank you.

ADULT JOE:  October 30, 1964.

34:03.792 --> 34:07.166
Our team was getting beaten
badly by Horseshoe Bay.

34:07.166 --> 34:10.291
This wasn't an altogether
uncommon occurrence,

34:10.291 --> 34:13.833
but on this particular day,
for no particular reason,

34:13.833 --> 34:15.958
Coach Higgins decided
to pack it in,

34:15.958 --> 34:18.667
so we could all go home.

34:18.667 --> 34:20.958
It was a decision
that would haunt
the poor man

34:20.958 --> 34:22.250
for the rest of his life.

34:24.625 --> 34:25.500

It was too high.

35:05.333 --> 35:06.959
Come on, Simon.
You can do it.

35:06.959 --> 35:08.542
Send it over the fence.

35:08.542 --> 35:10.333
Be sure to let go of the bat,
so you don't go with it.

he gave them to you.

45:20.667 --> 45:22.125
BOTH: Timber-r-r!

45:23.792 --> 45:25.291
(LAUGHS)

45:25.291 --> 45:27.250
One year good luck.

45:27.250 --> 45:28.417
One year good luck.

45:38.917 --> 45:40.792
Oh!
Oh, man, that's cold!

45:40.792 --> 45:42.166
It's freezing!

45:42.166 --> 45:43.875
My balls just turned
into prunes.

45:43.875 --> 45:44.917
My balls just turned
into raisins.

45:47.500 --> 45:48.458
Look!

46:00.500 --> 46:02.250
Come on.
I'll race you
to the dock.

46:02.250 --> 46:04.667
Nah, I don't think...
Ready, set, go.

46:04.667 --> 46:05.500
Hey, cheater!

46:07.333 --> 46:09.500
(LAUGHING)

46:09.500 --> 46:10.458
ADULT JOE:  When
someone you love dies,

46:12.125 --> 46:13.041
you don't lose them
all at once.

46:14.583 --> 46:16.458
You lose them in pieces,
over time.

46:18.041 --> 46:18.834
Like how the mail
stops coming.

46:21.125 --> 46:24.709
What I remember
most to this day
was my mother's scent.

46:24.709 --> 46:26.792
And how I hated it
when it began to disappear.

46:28.333 --> 46:31.834
First from her closets
and drawers,

46:31.834 --> 46:34.000
then from her dresses
she had sewed herself,

46:35.875 --> 46:37.500
and finally,
from her bed sheets
and pillowcases.

46:41.166 --> 46:42.917
Simon and I never talked much

46:42.917 --> 46:45.291
about that day
on the baseball field.

46:45.291 --> 46:46.709
It was too painful
for both of us.

46:49.375 --> 46:51.583
But as much as I loved
my mother,

46:51.583 --> 46:53.375
I knew that Simon loved her
just as much.

46:57.417 --> 46:59.375
She was the only real mother
he ever had.

47:23.959 --> 47:25.041
Hi, Grandmother.

47:29.083 --> 47:29.959
Grandmother?

47:32.750 --> 47:33.500
Joe.

47:37.417 --> 47:38.250
Come here.

47:42.917 --> 47:44.083
Sit down.

47:50.083 --> 47:51.417
Your mother was
very proud of you.

47:54.083 --> 47:55.041
Do you know that?

47:58.667 --> 48:00.291
She didn't want
any other children.

48:01.792 --> 48:02.792
Just you.

48:14.291 --> 48:16.417
I'm old, Joe. I won't
be around forever.

48:16.417 --> 48:17.000
Grandmother,
don't say that.

48:17.000 --> 48:17.834
Shh.

48:19.959 --> 48:21.083
And when I die,

48:23.000 --> 48:25.291
there will be no one left
to look after you.

48:27.917 --> 48:30.625
So, we have to decide
what's to become of you.

48:35.125 --> 48:36.083
What about my father?

48:39.917 --> 48:41.458
Only your mother knew
who that was.

48:45.125 --> 48:46.125
She never even
told me.

48:47.667 --> 48:48.458
Well, what if
I could find him?

48:50.208 --> 48:51.542
I mean,
if he could just meet me.

48:51.542 --> 48:53.000
If he knew what I was like.

48:53.000 --> 48:53.875
You can't think
that way.

49:04.083 --> 49:06.500
You have only yourself
to depend on now.

49:10.375 --> 49:11.208
Understand?

49:28.917 --> 49:29.834
You go wash up.

49:44.875 --> 49:46.875
ADULT JOE:  I knew then that
playing the guessing game

49:46.875 --> 49:49.875
with Simon wasn't going
to be enough anymore.

49:49.875 --> 49:50.875
I no longer just
wanted to know
who my father was,

49:52.750 --> 49:55.667
I had to know,
and I was running out of time.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.417
Suspect at 2:00.

50:14.417 --> 50:17.500
JOE: Mr. Van Gundy?
SIMON: He taught your
mother piano, right?

50:17.500 --> 50:20.417
That was
five years ago, Simon.
I'm 12, remember?

50:20.417 --> 50:21.750
Oh, yeah.
You're kind of small
for your age, aren't you?

50:21.750 --> 50:22.625
(LAUGHING)

50:24.625 --> 50:27.709
Suspect sweeping.

50:27.709 --> 50:31.750
Mr. Prescott?
He always saved the best
cuts of meat for my mom.

50:31.750 --> 50:35.083
I don't see how pork chops
could lead to intercourse,
no matter how good they are.

50:39.291 --> 50:41.792
Hi, Ben.
Hey.

50:44.250 --> 50:46.000
What are you guys doing?

50:46.000 --> 50:46.959
We were just...
It's personal.

50:48.208 --> 50:49.125
Oh.

50:52.166 --> 50:54.333
Hey, Ben.
Hey, Bob.
How are you?

50:54.333 --> 50:55.083
BOTH: Hi, Mr. Baker.

50:57.458 --> 50:58.625
Hey, guys.

51:00.166 --> 51:01.083
Hi, Joe.

51:02.959 --> 51:04.917
You know, I didn't get
a chance to talk to you
after the funeral.

51:06.125 --> 51:07.291
There were a lot
of people.

51:08.917 --> 51:11.583
That's because your mother
was a very special person.

51:12.291 --> 51:13.125
(GASPS)

51:14.291 --> 51:15.291
You need anything,

51:15.959 --> 51:17.291
just call, okay?

51:18.583 --> 51:20.583
Okay.
Okay.

51:22.959 --> 51:24.458
Well, good luck
on your first day
of school, guys.

51:26.500 --> 51:28.208
Just give me a holler
if you need anything, Ben.

51:28.208 --> 51:30.333
The office isn't usually
much help.

51:30.333 --> 51:31.375
Okay, thanks.

51:34.333 --> 51:36.291
I might try out for the
swim team this year,
Mr. Baker.

51:38.125 --> 51:39.166
That's great, Joe.

51:41.500 --> 51:43.333
JOE: I'm a swimmer
just like you.

51:43.333 --> 51:44.959
I'm just like you.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.291
Hey, either you guys
taking any drama courses
this fall?

51:57.667 --> 51:58.834
So, you know
what I'm gonna do?

51:58.834 --> 52:00.750
I'm gonna
finish off my errands,

52:00.750 --> 52:04.333
and, uh, if you guys
feel like it, uh,
come say "hi" tomorrow.

52:04.333 --> 52:05.625
Okay? All right.

52:06.500 --> 52:07.458
Bye, Ben.

52:10.834 --> 52:12.208
He called my mom
a special person.

52:12.208 --> 52:14.417
A "very" special person.

52:14.417 --> 52:16.000
They did spend the whole night
talking to each other at the

52:16.000 --> 52:17.667
parent-teacher conference.

52:17.667 --> 52:19.625
Why didn't
you mention this before?

52:19.625 --> 52:20.542
It's a parent-teacher
conference,

52:20.542 --> 52:21.917
they're supposed to talk.

52:21.917 --> 52:24.875
Not all night.
Especially with a gym teacher.

52:24.875 --> 52:26.166
What did you think
they were doing?

52:27.709 --> 52:29.875
Discussing your future
in dodge ball?

52:32.041 --> 52:33.375
Mr. Baker.

52:35.208 --> 52:36.208
Yeah.

52:37.583 --> 52:39.792
Let's go! Let's go!
Keep your legs kicking!

52:39.792 --> 52:42.542
Keep your legs kicking
right to the end!

52:42.542 --> 52:45.834
(WHISTLE BLOWS)
Hey, that's great.
That's great. Good work.

52:45.834 --> 52:49.083
Good work, you guys.
That's pretty good for
a first day of practice.

52:49.083 --> 52:50.458
Sean, good work.
Grab a towel.

52:51.458 --> 52:52.959

Well, I guess that's that.
Come on. Let's go.
Wait!

54:43.166 --> 54:44.875
Do you think if I gave you
a boost,

54:44.875 --> 54:46.333
you might be able
to reach the mail slot
and unlock the door?

54:46.333 --> 54:47.792
No.

54:47.792 --> 54:48.750
Oh, come on!
You're always saying

54:48.750 --> 54:50.333
that God has a special
plan for you, right?

54:50.333 --> 54:51.792
That he made you
this size for a reason.

54:51.792 --> 54:53.417
I don't think God's plan

54:53.417 --> 54:55.041
includes breaking
and entering.

54:55.041 --> 54:56.375
We're not
breaking anything!

54:57.125 --> 54:58.166

I figure this,

57:40.125 --> 57:42.041
you can either do
hard time right here
in prison,

57:43.959 --> 57:46.709

community service.

called the Reverend,

57:53.041 --> 57:55.083
and he'd be

babysit the stupid third
graders at some dumb camp.

there in the back room

58:08.375 --> 58:10.166

on tonight and they're
both out in the field.

other relatives?

58:31.542 --> 58:33.583
No, sir.
Did you call
my parents?

58:35.834 --> 58:36.875
Yes, I did.

58:38.750 --> 58:39.709
What did they say?

58:41.583 --> 58:43.041
They said that...

58:45.917 --> 58:47.792
maybe that we should leave
you here for the night.

58:51.250 --> 58:53.291
I guess they thought
it might teach you a lesson.

you guys outta here.

might come down here

but not mad.

I assume you had
a good reason for
doing what you did.

59:25.750 --> 59:27.959
The reason is that
Joe went psycho.

59:27.959 --> 59:29.250
Shut up, Simon.

59:29.250 --> 59:31.125
That's a good reason
as any.

It is?
Sure.

59:39.291 --> 59:42.792
Oh, it's certainly
not fair.

59:42.792 --> 59:44.125
Hey, you guys want
to go get,

59:44.125 --> 59:46.333
uh, some pizza
or a hot dog
or somethin'?

59:46.333 --> 59:48.291
You want to
take us for pizza?

59:48.291 --> 59:50.000
Yeah, it's 9:00.
Aren't you hungry?

59:50.000 --> 59:52.792
It's not that.
It would be like...

59:52.792 --> 59:54.291
rewarding us
for bad behavior.

59:56.125 --> 59:56.667
But if you really
want to.

59:56.667 --> 59:58.834
No, Joe.

59:58.834 --> 01:00:01.166
It wouldn't be right
to take advantage
of Ben like that.

01:00:01.166 --> 01:00:02.792
No pizza for us.

01:00:03.625 --> 01:00:04.834

if I'll ever find out
who my father is.

01:00:27.041 --> 01:00:28.458
Maybe she figured
you weren't ready
for the truth.

01:00:30.709 --> 01:00:31.709
Ben?

01:00:33.542 --> 01:00:35.917
Do you know the truth?

01:00:35.917 --> 01:00:39.667
No. I guess your mom
was just gonna tell me
when she was ready.

01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:46.709
But if you did know,
would you tell me?

01:00:49.792 --> 01:00:50.834
Yeah.

01:00:52.208 --> 01:00:53.375
Yes, I would.

01:00:54.542 --> 01:00:55.667
Ben?

01:00:57.709 --> 01:00:59.542
Did Miss Wenteworth
ever talk about me?

01:01:01.208 --> 01:01:03.083
(CHUCKLES)
All the time, Simon.

01:01:03.083 --> 01:01:05.375
Everybody talks about you.

01:01:05.375 --> 01:01:07.458
That's how we keep
from gettin' bored.

01:01:07.458 --> 01:01:09.917
Did she tell you
about my destiny?
Simon!

01:01:09.917 --> 01:01:12.041
What do you mean?

01:01:12.041 --> 01:01:14.625
I'm going to be
a hero.
BEN: You are?

01:01:14.625 --> 01:01:16.375
Pretty vague
job description,
isn't it?

01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:19.750
How you gonna do that?
I don't know.

01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:24.417
I keep waiting for God
to show me a sign.

01:01:24.417 --> 01:01:26.458
Like the burning bush
in the  Ten Commandments.

01:01:26.458 --> 01:01:29.709
(CHUCKLES)

01:01:29.709 --> 01:01:31.542
But I guess he doesn't
go in for that kind of
thing anymore.

01:01:33.208 --> 01:01:36.417
Well, uh, you know, you got
to be a little patient.

01:01:36.417 --> 01:01:39.083
I have been patient, but
I'm running out of time.

01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:42.959
Simon, you're
12 years old!

01:01:44.458 --> 01:01:45.709
You've got
all the time
in the world!

01:01:48.583 --> 01:01:50.041
I don't think so, Ben.

01:02:01.375 --> 01:02:03.583
ADULT JOE:
Time is a monster that
cannot be reasoned with.

01:02:06.166 --> 01:02:08.000
It responds like a snail
to our impatience.

01:02:10.291 --> 01:02:12.458
Then it races
like a gazelle when you
can't catch your breath.

01:02:14.709 --> 01:02:17.542
Simon and I were
in such a hurry to get
to the answers at the end

01:02:17.542 --> 01:02:19.959
of the road that
we never took time to read
the signs along the way.

01:02:22.458 --> 01:02:25.792
How could we have known
that everything was working
together for a reason?

01:02:25.792 --> 01:02:28.500
MISS LEAVEY:
And so I expect each
and every one of you

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.625
will lend a hand
in making this

01:02:30.625 --> 01:02:33.250
the best Christmas
pageant ever.

01:02:35.709 --> 01:02:39.333
So, now, are there
any volunteers
for roles,

01:02:39.333 --> 01:02:41.291
or shall I
just choose?

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:42.792
Well, I'll play Joseph!

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:44.834
Good for you, Eddie.

01:02:44.834 --> 01:02:46.333
Looks like
I got the lead.

01:02:46.333 --> 01:02:47.834
What lead?

01:02:47.834 --> 01:02:49.959
It's the Virgin Mary,
Eddie.

01:02:49.959 --> 01:02:52.500
What does Joseph have
to do with anything?

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.291

01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:16.500

our Mary this year?

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.417
Yes, ma'am.
Good girl!

01:03:22.041 --> 01:03:24.166
All right, now.
Which one of our

01:03:24.166 --> 01:03:27.917

would like to be the
Three Wise Men?

01:03:28.583 --> 01:03:30.875
Hmm?

01:03:30.875 --> 01:03:32.875
Three Wise Men.
Who's it gonna be?

01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:35.583
All right.

01:03:35.583 --> 01:03:39.041
Gary, Allen, Matthew,
you will be the Wise Men.

01:03:42.291 --> 01:03:43.375
Now let's see what
we've got.

01:03:43.375 --> 01:03:45.083
Ah, well, we've got
the shepherds,

01:03:45.083 --> 01:03:47.500
but they don't have
a lot to do.

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:49.917
ADULT JOE:  Miss Leavey
always tried to downplay

01:03:49.917 --> 01:03:52.834
the role of the shepherds,
but we weren't fooled.

01:03:52.834 --> 01:03:53.917
We knew they were
the plum roles

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:55.709
because all you had to do

01:03:55.709 --> 01:03:59.083
was stand around with a staff
and try not to laugh

01:03:59.083 --> 01:04:01.333
at the poor saps
that got stuck with
the speaking parts.

01:04:01.333 --> 01:04:03.125
All right.
Hands down.
Hands down.

01:04:03.125 --> 01:04:08.041
Uh, Joe, Melanie,
Ming, Tommy.

01:04:08.041 --> 01:04:12.583
You will be
our shepherds.

01:04:12.583 --> 01:04:14.250
All right.
Now, let's see
what's next.

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:15.208
We've got...
Oh, the angel.

01:04:16.375 --> 01:04:17.709
Yes, the angel.

01:04:19.417 --> 01:04:22.917

I can't!
I'm afraid of heights!

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:40.583
Well, then, this will be
the perfect chance to
face your fears.

01:04:40.583 --> 01:04:43.166
Can't I be
a donkey or somethin'?
You're an angel.

01:04:43.166 --> 01:04:45.959
You have your own
special pillar of light
for all the world to see.

Well, I'll switch
with Howard.
MISS LEAVEY: No!

01:04:47.125 --> 01:04:48.792
Yeah! I could be Joseph,

01:04:48.792 --> 01:04:50.792
Joseph does nothing.
Told ya.

01:04:50.792 --> 01:04:53.125

a wonderful angel, Howard.

there would be no play.

I'm not playing
the baby Jesus,
so just forget it!

01:05:13.625 --> 01:05:14.834
You're the only one who
fits into the manger.

01:05:14.834 --> 01:05:16.333
I won't do it!

01:45:24.083 --> 01:45:25.709
You're the best
friend I ever had.

01:45:41.625 --> 01:45:42.625

its icy chill behind.

and summer again.

that June

01:47:30.333 --> 01:47:31.834
following a stroke.

And because Hildie
was always so content
to just follow her lead,

01:47:36.166 --> 01:47:37.291
she had
a stroke of her own
and died in July.

side by side.

01:47:45.208 --> 01:47:47.208

It's the same prayer that he
said at my mother's grave,

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.250
that night I found him
in the darkness.

I'm coming.

thinking about that.

in the squirt league, right?
