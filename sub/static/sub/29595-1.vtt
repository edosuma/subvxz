(film reel clicks)

00:28.116 --> 00:30.783
(woman screams)

00:33.769 --> 00:36.352
(ominous music)

00:58.865 --> 01:01.532
(woman screams)

01:05.158 --> 01:06.325
- Kind friend,

01:07.184 --> 01:09.017
beware as you pass by.

01:11.437 --> 01:14.980
As you are now, so once was I.

01:16.740 --> 01:17.693
As I am now,

01:19.540 --> 01:21.240
so you must be.

01:23.541 --> 01:27.413
Prepare yourself to follow me.

01:28.853 --> 01:30.113
(screams)

01:30.113 --> 01:31.797
- Let the devil take his own.

01:32.775 --> 01:35.943
(woman screams)

01:35.943 --> 01:40.943
(executioner grunts)
(blood gurgles)

01:59.281 --> 02:02.031
(dramatic music)

02:11.400 --> 02:13.900
(eerie music)

02:16.676 --> 02:19.426
(dramatic music)

02:42.732 --> 02:43.577
(priest breathes heavily)

02:43.577 --> 02:45.994
(loons call)

03:09.752 --> 03:12.835
(somber piano music)

04:53.329 --> 04:55.829
(bird chirps)

05:30.939 --> 05:34.022
(screen door creaks)

05:44.341 --> 05:47.008
(pensive music)

06:41.174 --> 06:43.924
(crickets chirp)

06:58.951 --> 07:01.534
(somber music)

07:36.369 --> 07:39.369
(frightening music)

07:49.177 --> 07:51.677
(door knocks)

07:57.026 --> 07:57.859
(door knocks)

07:57.859 --> 08:00.192
(man sighs)

08:07.981 --> 08:10.481
(door knocks)

08:12.196 --> 08:13.350
(door knocks)

08:13.350 --> 08:14.820
- [Man] Yeah?

08:14.820 --> 08:15.653
Hold on.

08:23.230 --> 08:26.350
- Gunderson said you were gonna be here.

08:26.350 --> 08:28.450
Wanted me to check on you,

08:28.450 --> 08:30.903
see if you got everything working okay.

08:32.190 --> 08:33.573
- Yeah, I think I got it.

08:35.100 --> 08:37.273
- Oh, I'm Emery, by the way.

08:38.159 --> 08:42.053
I live just right over there,
right across the field.

08:43.110 --> 08:45.063
Saw you drive by last night.

08:46.770 --> 08:47.603
- Louis.

08:47.603 --> 08:48.436
- Louis.

08:48.436 --> 08:51.573
Well, nice meeting you, Louis.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.220
(chuckles)

08:53.220 --> 08:56.480
Hey, you picked a pretty isolated area

08:56.480 --> 08:58.563
to come for a vacation, that's for sure.

08:59.538 --> 09:01.180
- I'm not really here on vacation.

09:01.180 --> 09:02.013
- Oh?

09:04.180 --> 09:05.253
What you doing here?

09:06.106 --> 09:09.910
- I needed some place
to escape from the city,

09:09.910 --> 09:10.893
some place quiet.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.262
Figured I do a little fishing.

09:13.262 --> 09:16.700
- Ah, well, you couldn't have picked

09:16.700 --> 09:19.490
a better spot.
(chuckles)

09:20.830 --> 09:23.010
There's not much to do around here,

09:23.010 --> 09:24.482
but if you're into fishing,

09:24.482 --> 09:27.340
oh boy, we got a couple o' nice lakes.

09:27.340 --> 09:30.000
Round Lake is just up the road a bit.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.320
Indian Lake is right back over there.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.170
It's a little shallow.

09:35.170 --> 09:38.090
I prefer Round Lake myself.

09:38.090 --> 09:39.580
Bigger walleye.

09:39.580 --> 09:40.550
- Thanks for letting me know.

09:40.550 --> 09:41.383
- Yeah.

09:43.400 --> 09:46.850
Well, it's good to see
someone staying here.

09:46.850 --> 09:49.540
House is usually empty,
you know, come fall.

09:49.540 --> 09:52.460
Gundersons, they like
to head down south early

09:52.460 --> 09:53.493
to beat the winter.

09:54.657 --> 09:56.469
(chuckles)

09:56.469 --> 09:57.302
- It's a nice place.

09:57.302 --> 09:59.040
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.780
Now, you might see some local teenagers

10:01.780 --> 10:03.530
driving around the property, drinking.

10:03.530 --> 10:04.747
Don't mind 'em.

10:05.710 --> 10:09.290
Just give 'em a shout and they'll go away.

10:09.290 --> 10:11.083
They're used to nobody being here.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.081
- Well, thanks.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.693
- Yeah.

10:15.693 --> 10:17.210
Yeah.

10:17.210 --> 10:19.920
Well, if you need anything,

10:19.920 --> 10:21.940
any help or anything, remember,

10:21.940 --> 10:24.173
I'm just right over
there across the field.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.093
So enjoy yourself.

10:28.090 --> 10:29.057
Have a good one.

10:37.866 --> 10:40.366
(wind blows)

10:44.801 --> 10:47.384
(somber music)

12:43.855 --> 12:46.605
(mystical music)

13:39.757 --> 13:42.723
- [Louis] "Kind friend,
beware as you pass by.

13:44.177 --> 13:46.380
"As you are now, so once was I."

13:55.048 --> 13:57.548
(eerie music)

14:02.144 --> 14:04.811
(loons call)

14:58.895 --> 15:02.213
- [Bartender] Haven't seen
you around here before.

15:02.213 --> 15:04.670
- Yeah, I just got in last night.

15:04.670 --> 15:07.560
- Oh, where you from?

15:07.560 --> 15:09.079
- I live in the cities.

15:09.079 --> 15:10.020
- The cities?

15:10.020 --> 15:11.070
What you do up there?

15:12.220 --> 15:14.847
- I write sports for the Tribune.

15:14.847 --> 15:15.680
- [Man] Well.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.223
- So what brought you down here?

15:19.580 --> 15:22.280
- Just needed to get away from
the cities for a little bit.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.540
My friend's cousins with the Gundersons,

15:24.540 --> 15:26.978
so staying out there.

15:26.978 --> 15:28.940
- Gundersons, they're
nice folks over there.

15:28.940 --> 15:30.060
Hey, did you do any fishin'?

15:30.060 --> 15:31.520
It's been a real good year for walleye.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.300
- Hell, I got a good one yesterday.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.133
- Did you really?

15:34.133 --> 15:34.966
- Had a real good sucker last night.

15:34.966 --> 15:36.390
- I'll bet you did.

15:36.390 --> 15:37.470
Where'd you get 'em at?

15:37.470 --> 15:38.890
- Just off of the point.

15:38.890 --> 15:39.723
- Oh okay, yeah sure,

15:39.723 --> 15:42.217
I was out there couple weeks ago.

15:42.217 --> 15:44.663
- I went out to Loon Lake today.

15:46.190 --> 15:47.040
- Catch anything?

15:48.110 --> 15:49.760
- Actually didn't do any fishing.

15:50.620 --> 15:52.320
Just wandered around a little bit.

15:54.100 --> 15:55.700
Found an old cemetery out there.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.730
- Oh, the old Loon Lake cemetery.

15:59.730 --> 16:01.920
- Haven't been out there in a long time.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.837
- I was out there one time this summer.

16:03.837 --> 16:05.937
- You were, what were you doing out there?

16:06.910 --> 16:07.829
- Not much.

16:07.829 --> 16:10.713
(men laugh)

16:10.713 --> 16:11.737
- "Not much."

16:13.020 --> 16:13.873
I'm sure.

16:15.377 --> 16:16.430
Yep.

16:16.430 --> 16:18.909
Yeah, nobody goes out there
much anymore, 'cept Jeb.

16:18.909 --> 16:19.950
- Yeah, just Jeb.

16:19.950 --> 16:20.860
- Yeah, he goes out there

16:20.860 --> 16:22.530
and he keeps the
headstones nice and clean,

16:22.530 --> 16:26.040
and you know, he'll pick
weeds around the grave sites

16:26.040 --> 16:27.810
and keeps the town kids away.

16:27.810 --> 16:28.700
- Used to be a church too,

16:28.700 --> 16:30.458
but that burned down a
long time ago, you know.

16:30.458 --> 16:31.387
- It did?

16:31.387 --> 16:33.060
I didn't know there was a church there.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.210
- Yeah, I saw a couple
headstones out there.

16:35.210 --> 16:37.280
Like some of 'em died pretty young.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.080
- You must not know the story, then.

16:41.820 --> 16:42.793
- No, what story?

16:43.690 --> 16:44.800
- Oh, yeah?

16:44.800 --> 16:47.388
Supposed to be a witch buried out there.

16:47.388 --> 16:48.920
- [Bartender] Mmhmm.

16:48.920 --> 16:49.753
- Really?

16:49.753 --> 16:50.586
- Yeah.

16:50.586 --> 16:52.530
They say they beheaded her way back when.

16:52.530 --> 16:55.100
Took three chops before her head came off.

16:55.100 --> 16:57.090
They buried her out there,
along with the ax they used.

16:57.090 --> 16:59.410
- Isn't that something?

16:59.410 --> 17:00.790
What was her name again?

17:00.790 --> 17:02.030
- Maggie?
- Mill?

17:02.030 --> 17:02.863
Milly?

17:02.863 --> 17:03.870
- Her name was Mary Jane.

17:03.870 --> 17:04.703
- Oh, yeah.
- May Jane.

17:04.703 --> 17:05.536
That was it.

17:05.536 --> 17:06.780
- Mary Jane.
- Mary Jane.

17:06.780 --> 17:08.270
Mary Jane Terlinden.

17:08.270 --> 17:11.329
Story goes that she was a witch,

17:11.329 --> 17:13.240
and she put a curse on our town

17:13.240 --> 17:14.770
so the crops wouldn't grow.

17:14.770 --> 17:16.359
- They say she stole a baby, too.

17:16.359 --> 17:18.005
Killed it in some kinda ritual.

17:18.005 --> 17:19.609
- [Bartender] Oh, poor baby.

17:19.609 --> 17:20.900
- Nobody knows for sure, though.

17:20.900 --> 17:22.369
- [Bartender] Yeah,
people say a lotta things.

17:22.369 --> 17:23.530
- Yeah, they do.

17:23.530 --> 17:26.450
Yeah, they say if you walk
over her grave three times,

17:26.450 --> 17:27.900
she comes for you in
the middle of the night

17:27.900 --> 17:29.450
and you die an accidental death.

17:29.450 --> 17:32.720
- Yeah, there he died of
carbon monoxide poisoning.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.480
- I always heard his
car was faulty, though.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.390
- Eh, could be.

17:36.390 --> 17:39.900
There's another guy, they say he drowned,

17:39.900 --> 17:41.930
but he was a real good swimmer.

17:41.930 --> 17:44.070
So just buncha hearsay.

17:44.070 --> 17:45.130
- Yeah.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.730
Just a good ghost story we
use to scare the kids with.

17:47.730 --> 17:49.480
- Stupid kids (chuckles).

17:49.480 --> 17:51.510
- I hope you weren't too careless

17:51.510 --> 17:53.422
when you were out there.

17:53.422 --> 17:54.255
- Yeah.

17:57.800 --> 17:58.950
- Yeah, let's hope not.

18:00.197 --> 18:02.947
(crickets chirp)

18:04.534 --> 18:07.200
- You going across to
get something to eat?

18:07.200 --> 18:08.033
- Yeah.

18:09.890 --> 18:11.370
- Well, I'll come with you.

18:11.370 --> 18:13.620
I haven't eaten, and I
could use the company.

18:15.090 --> 18:16.140
- Sure.

18:16.140 --> 18:17.166
- [Emery] Evening boys.

18:17.166 --> 18:17.999
- Emery.
- Hey Emery.

18:17.999 --> 18:18.980
- Gracie (chuckles).

18:20.893 --> 18:22.027
Hey.

18:22.027 --> 18:22.860
Oh.

18:22.860 --> 18:24.030
- Hey.
- Louis.

18:24.030 --> 18:25.980
Hey, did you fine Round Lake all right?

18:25.980 --> 18:27.830
- Well, he found Loon Lake.

18:27.830 --> 18:29.200
- Yeah, yeah.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.850
Ended up getting lost.

18:30.850 --> 18:31.930
- Really?

18:31.930 --> 18:35.890
Well, I hope it was nice.

18:35.890 --> 18:36.723
- It was.

18:37.590 --> 18:39.340
- [Bartender] He went to the cemetery.

18:39.340 --> 18:40.590
- Well, good night Emery.

18:41.500 --> 18:42.333
- Good night, Gordie.

18:42.333 --> 18:43.166
See you tomorrow, bud.

18:43.166 --> 18:43.999
- Goodnight, Gracie.

18:43.999 --> 18:44.940
- Goodnight, Gracie.

18:44.940 --> 18:46.923
- [Gordie] Nice meetin' ya, young fella.

18:50.591 --> 18:53.174
(Gracie sighs)

18:55.104 --> 18:55.952
- [Louis] Over here?

18:55.952 --> 18:57.369
- [Gracie] Mmhmm.

19:00.182 --> 19:03.099
- [Louis] What was your name again?

19:04.500 --> 19:07.823
- So um, you just work down the street?

19:09.580 --> 19:11.300
- No, that's just my part-time thing.

19:11.300 --> 19:14.980
I'm actually a nurse at
the hospital in Okaboji.

19:17.171 --> 19:18.669
- Oka, Oka-what?

19:18.669 --> 19:19.502
(Gracie laughs)

19:19.502 --> 19:20.550
- Okaboji.

19:20.550 --> 19:23.913
It's 20 minutes away,
across the border, in Iowa.

19:26.440 --> 19:27.273
- Iowa, huh?

19:31.570 --> 19:32.453
- You're married.

19:37.355 --> 19:38.188
- Yeah.

19:39.940 --> 19:40.773
I am.

19:43.207 --> 19:45.563
I mean, I was.

19:47.670 --> 19:50.083
- Oh, are you divorced?

19:52.230 --> 19:53.063
- She died.

19:54.790 --> 19:57.453
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

20:00.079 --> 20:01.129
- Here's your supper.

20:02.080 --> 20:02.913
- Thank you.

20:02.913 --> 20:03.746
- Thanks.

20:12.790 --> 20:14.220
I almost got married once,

20:14.220 --> 20:17.390
but then I caught him with another girl,

20:17.390 --> 20:18.923
so there went that.

20:20.749 --> 20:22.916
(exhales)

20:24.060 --> 20:24.893
- Yeah.

20:26.530 --> 20:29.453
- Well, here's to the ones we love.

20:33.990 --> 20:35.340
There's a smile (chuckles).

20:36.200 --> 20:37.300
Welcome to Round Lake.

20:41.710 --> 20:44.460
(crickets chirp)

20:50.900 --> 20:52.475
- Hey, you want me to give you a ride?

20:52.475 --> 20:53.308
- Oh, oh, wait.

20:53.308 --> 20:54.259
- [Gracie] Whoa.

20:54.259 --> 20:55.092
- Oh, but I'm good.

20:55.092 --> 20:56.993
- (laughs) You sure about that?

20:58.189 --> 20:59.270
Why don't I give you a ride?

20:59.270 --> 21:00.420
My sister lives close.

21:00.420 --> 21:01.420
She can come get me.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.850
- Yeah, maybe that's a good idea.

21:10.272 --> 21:13.150
Where are all the people at?

21:13.150 --> 21:14.200
- This is Round Lake.

21:20.181 --> 21:22.264
(laughs)

21:25.084 --> 21:27.167
(pensive music)

21:29.715 --> 21:32.110
I hope they didn't spook you too much,

21:32.110 --> 21:33.893
talking about our local witch.

21:35.151 --> 21:36.740
- No.

21:36.740 --> 21:39.363
I don't really believe
in ghosts and witches.

21:42.291 --> 21:43.803
I really don't believe in anything.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.093
- I don't really believe any of it either,

21:51.170 --> 21:54.643
but I still don't go walking
around Loon Lake alone.

21:56.730 --> 21:57.563
- Yeah?

21:58.770 --> 22:00.437
What's the truth, then?

22:02.963 --> 22:04.320
- I don't know for certain,

22:04.320 --> 22:08.910
but I do know a girl named
Mary Jane died a long time ago.

22:08.910 --> 22:10.370
They said she was a witch,

22:10.370 --> 22:12.170
and they buried her out by the lake.

22:13.370 --> 22:15.610
You know, it was Emery's great grandfather

22:15.610 --> 22:16.963
who had her executed.

22:19.428 --> 22:21.900
- Really?

22:21.900 --> 22:23.501
My neighbor, Emery?

22:23.501 --> 22:24.480
- Mmhmm.

22:24.480 --> 22:26.440
He doesn't like to talk about it,

22:26.440 --> 22:28.740
but his great grandfather
was the town pastor.

22:31.360 --> 22:32.343
- Oh, yeah?

22:32.343 --> 22:35.700
- Yeah, there's one story that says

22:35.700 --> 22:37.483
Mary Jane came back from the dead.

22:41.797 --> 22:42.630
- Oh, yeah?

22:44.186 --> 22:48.270
- The story goes, Pastor
Janson was out there

22:48.270 --> 22:50.403
giving her last rites.

22:58.150 --> 22:58.983
- Father,

23:00.921 --> 23:02.120
(ominous music)

23:02.120 --> 23:02.953
Son,

23:08.060 --> 23:09.123
Holy Ghost.

23:16.870 --> 23:17.893
Mary Jane,

23:20.320 --> 23:25.223
may your sins be forgiven,

23:27.950 --> 23:32.532
and may your soul rest in peace.

23:32.532 --> 23:37.532
(thunder rumbles)
(eerie violin music)

23:42.548 --> 23:45.381
(thunder rumbles)

23:56.608 --> 23:59.608
(eerie vocal music)

24:24.082 --> 24:27.082
(church bell rings)

24:29.923 --> 24:32.802
(church bell rings)

24:32.802 --> 24:34.219
Give me strength.

24:35.403 --> 24:38.403
(frightening music)

24:57.443 --> 24:59.943
(doors creak)

25:03.626 --> 25:07.043
(crickets chirp faintly)

25:17.019 --> 25:19.519
(doors groan)

25:20.478 --> 25:23.478
(frightening music)

25:25.305 --> 25:29.817
Unclean spirit, I cast you out.

25:31.930 --> 25:34.290
This is the Lord's house.

25:34.290 --> 25:37.033
- This is no one's house.

25:38.870 --> 25:42.573
With three chops, you killed me.

25:44.000 --> 25:49.000
With three strides across my
resting bones, you woke me.

25:51.523 --> 25:55.050
And I will come for
thee, in three days time.

25:58.610 --> 26:00.010
- Get thee behind me, Satan.

26:01.531 --> 26:05.355
(dramatic music)
(thunder bangs)

26:05.355 --> 26:07.516
(explosion booms)

26:07.516 --> 26:10.266
(flames crackle)

26:11.785 --> 26:13.162
(thunder bangs)

26:13.162 --> 26:16.495
(Pastor Janson screams)

26:17.860 --> 26:20.690
- The church burned down to the ground,

26:20.690 --> 26:25.190
but what was crazy was Pastor
Jensen survived the fire.

26:25.190 --> 26:26.410
He was severely burned,

26:26.410 --> 26:29.697
and he just screamed
in agony for three days

26:29.697 --> 26:32.130
before he finally passed.

26:32.130 --> 26:35.663
And after that, everyone
avoided the cemetery.

26:38.136 --> 26:40.532
(Louis exhales)

26:40.532 --> 26:41.365
- I think you country folk

26:41.365 --> 26:43.033
need to get out a little bit more.

26:44.192 --> 26:45.025
(Gracie exhales)

26:45.025 --> 26:46.583
- Yeah, quiet, lonely places.

26:47.900 --> 26:49.633
They make your imagination run wild.

26:55.953 --> 26:58.703
(crickets chirp)

27:11.458 --> 27:12.291
(Gracie sighs)

27:12.291 --> 27:14.163
There's no reception out here.

27:15.030 --> 27:15.903
- Yeah, it's bad.

27:18.030 --> 27:20.234
Come on in, you can use the house phone.

27:20.234 --> 27:21.234
- Thank you.

27:25.344 --> 27:28.136
(ominous music)

27:28.136 --> 27:30.803
(grass rustles)

27:35.590 --> 27:36.423
You okay?

27:43.540 --> 27:44.373
- [Louis] Yeah.

27:52.051 --> 27:54.051
(sighs)

27:55.438 --> 27:56.271
Man.

27:57.130 --> 27:58.170
Phone's right over there.

27:58.170 --> 27:59.370
- [Gracie] Okay, thanks.

28:01.357 --> 28:03.857
(Louis sighs)

28:06.886 --> 28:08.533
Hey, were you asleep?

28:08.533 --> 28:10.750
(ominous music)

28:10.750 --> 28:12.164
Can you come pick me up?

28:12.164 --> 28:13.630
I'm at the Gunderson's farm.

28:13.630 --> 28:15.483
Left my car in town.

28:16.826 --> 28:17.659
What?

28:18.504 --> 28:20.337
No, everything's fine.

28:22.326 --> 28:25.440
(laughs) I'll tell you
about it when you get here.

28:25.440 --> 28:30.161
Okay, see you soon, bye.
(eerie music)

28:30.161 --> 28:31.861
(sighs) My sister'll be here soon.

28:33.020 --> 28:34.617
- [Louis] Uh-huh.

28:34.617 --> 28:36.737
- She doesn't live far from here, so.

28:39.000 --> 28:39.833
- Okay.

28:45.130 --> 28:46.130
(sighs)

28:46.130 --> 28:46.963
I hate this.

28:49.194 --> 28:50.027
My day.

28:52.183 --> 28:53.377
(chuckles)

28:53.377 --> 28:55.650
- You know, I've always
thought about moving

28:55.650 --> 28:57.520
out to the twin cities.

28:57.520 --> 29:00.070
Just get out of this small
town and go somewhere

29:00.070 --> 29:01.370
where nobody knows your name,

29:01.370 --> 29:04.060
your business.
(ominous music)

29:04.060 --> 29:05.616
The last time I was out there, actually,

29:05.616 --> 29:08.993
we went to a Twins game
at the new stadium.

29:10.733 --> 29:14.066
(Louis breathes deeply)

29:36.604 --> 29:37.620
(frightening music)

29:37.620 --> 29:38.820
Hey.

29:38.820 --> 29:39.717
Oh, sorry.

29:40.800 --> 29:42.613
Sorry, my sister's here.

29:44.020 --> 29:45.680
You fell asleep.

29:45.680 --> 29:46.721
I didn't wanna wake you,

29:46.721 --> 29:48.221
'cause you looked so peaceful.

29:50.900 --> 29:53.483
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Gracie.

29:54.970 --> 29:56.650
Thanks for driving me home.

29:56.650 --> 29:58.243
- Yeah, you know, it's a small town.

29:58.243 --> 29:59.643
It's what we do around here,

30:00.720 --> 30:02.470
help each other out.

30:02.470 --> 30:06.533
Um, here's my number if you need anything.

30:09.650 --> 30:10.917
- Thanks again.

30:10.917 --> 30:12.167
- Seeya 'round.

30:17.918 --> 30:20.992
(crickets chirp)

30:20.992 --> 30:23.609
(ominous music)

30:23.609 --> 30:27.359
- [Woman] Kind friend,
beware as you pass by.

30:30.816 --> 30:32.066
As you are now,

30:33.245 --> 30:38.245
so once was I.
(church bell rings)

30:40.666 --> 30:43.080
- I finished for the day, pastor.

30:43.080 --> 30:47.043
- Your efforts are most
appreciated by the congregation.

30:48.738 --> 30:50.450
- Thank you.

30:50.450 --> 30:54.520
- Why do you not attend services?

30:54.520 --> 30:57.150
You've been a member
of our little community

30:57.150 --> 30:58.913
almost a year now.

31:00.516 --> 31:02.630
- I'm a very spiritual person, pastor,

31:02.630 --> 31:05.460
but my church is in nature,

31:05.460 --> 31:07.963
though I am very happy to
serve the community here.

31:12.841 --> 31:14.924
(tranquil music)

31:21.600 --> 31:26.600
- You are such a beautiful young woman.

31:28.990 --> 31:33.050
I've found my gaze drifting to you

31:33.050 --> 31:34.347
for some time now.

31:36.350 --> 31:41.350
How has the Lord not
blessed you with a husband?

31:44.918 --> 31:46.751
If I was your husband.

31:49.494 --> 31:51.244
- What are you doing?

31:52.113 --> 31:54.004
What about your wife?

31:54.004 --> 31:55.034
- My wife?

31:55.034 --> 31:59.757
Oh, my wife will not find
out about this, Mary Jane.

32:01.289 --> 32:02.356
- No.

32:02.356 --> 32:04.002
I will scream.

32:04.002 --> 32:07.213
- Mary Jane.

32:10.499 --> 32:12.583
- I thought you were a man of God.

32:26.351 --> 32:31.184
(flames crackle)
(mystical music)

32:33.810 --> 32:36.310
(birds chirp)

32:41.465 --> 32:43.882
(fire roars)

32:58.590 --> 33:03.590
Spirit of the wind, bring forth
a storm to feed the earth.

33:18.661 --> 33:21.578
(foreboding music)

33:34.601 --> 33:37.750
(tense music)

33:37.750 --> 33:40.833
(Mary Jane whimpers)

33:44.921 --> 33:47.818
(Mary Jane screams)

33:47.818 --> 33:50.818
(Mary Jane screams)

33:53.299 --> 33:56.299
(Mary Jane screams)

34:05.300 --> 34:08.150
- [Man] We've been at this
for nearly three days now.

34:08.150 --> 34:09.730
She hasn't confessed.

34:09.730 --> 34:10.670
Perhaps she's innocent.

34:10.670 --> 34:13.170
- You saw her hidden in the woods,

34:13.170 --> 34:15.230
practicing her evil ways.

34:15.230 --> 34:16.219
The girl is a witch.

34:16.219 --> 34:18.443
She has made a pact with Satan, I know it.

34:19.290 --> 34:22.830
It is she who has cursed
our land and crops.

34:22.830 --> 34:26.483
- The girl has repeated her
innocence, and I believe her.

34:28.380 --> 34:30.143
- She's bewitched you, Larson.

34:31.589 --> 34:33.059
Get out.

34:33.059 --> 34:34.641
- I am not a witch.

34:35.770 --> 34:37.513
I am only a child of nature.

34:38.792 --> 34:40.813
I have committed no crimes, please.

34:42.597 --> 34:44.889
Please cut me down, please.

34:44.889 --> 34:48.763
- She attempts to blind us from the truth.

34:52.020 --> 34:53.333
Find the devil's mark.

34:54.590 --> 34:58.203
He's hidden it well in her flesh.

34:59.110 --> 35:01.563
- I have no mark of Satan upon me,

35:03.140 --> 35:07.143
but I will remember your
devil's hand, Pastor Janson.

35:08.962 --> 35:09.795
- Find it.

35:11.788 --> 35:12.873
(Mary Jane screams)

35:12.873 --> 35:15.373
(eerie music)

35:22.086 --> 35:24.586
(eerie music)

35:28.488 --> 35:30.905
(bed creaks)

35:38.690 --> 35:41.743
(person sighs)

35:41.743 --> 35:44.243
(tense music)

35:50.046 --> 35:52.877
(frightening music)

35:52.877 --> 35:57.877
(wall bangs)
(dramatic music)

36:12.396 --> 36:15.146
(crickets chirp)

36:15.990 --> 36:18.740
- Hey.
(boys chatter distantly)

36:18.740 --> 36:19.943
I saw you out there.

36:23.050 --> 36:25.050
You're not scaring me, you little shits.

36:27.110 --> 36:28.013
Come on out.

36:33.203 --> 36:35.838
You think you're tough?

36:35.838 --> 36:36.671
Huh?

36:38.410 --> 36:39.433
Hiding in the corn?

36:42.980 --> 36:43.813
You're not.

36:49.832 --> 36:50.999
I'm comin' in.

36:53.205 --> 36:54.705
Where you at, huh?

36:58.948 --> 37:02.090
I know you're out here somewhere.

37:02.090 --> 37:02.940
You little punks.

37:09.222 --> 37:12.055
(mosquito buzzes)

37:17.481 --> 37:19.981
(eerie music)

37:24.950 --> 37:26.250
Why don't you come on out?

37:30.562 --> 37:33.285
You think you're messing with me?

37:33.285 --> 37:34.118
Huh?

37:37.730 --> 37:38.893
Well, you're not.

37:45.080 --> 37:45.963
You want some?

37:47.957 --> 37:48.790
Huh?

37:51.287 --> 37:55.183
Well I got Tito and Pepe
sitting here waiting for ya.

37:55.183 --> 37:58.158
(boys laugh distantly)

37:58.158 --> 37:59.608
So why don't you come on out?

38:02.769 --> 38:05.769
(frightening music)

38:08.411 --> 38:10.244
That's what I thought.

38:15.008 --> 38:16.925
You know where I'll be.

38:26.174 --> 38:28.257
(ominous music)

38:50.304 --> 38:53.304
(frightening music)

39:03.513 --> 39:05.219
(birds chirp)

39:05.219 --> 39:07.552
(owl hoots)

39:15.249 --> 39:17.916
(wind buffets)

39:26.257 --> 39:28.924
(intense music)

39:43.611 --> 39:46.611
(frightening music)

39:52.160 --> 39:54.167
You sure you didn't hear or see anybody

39:54.167 --> 39:56.340
come into my place last night?

39:56.340 --> 39:57.530
- Nope.

39:57.530 --> 39:58.630
I didn't see anything.

39:59.520 --> 40:01.090
It was real quiet last night.

40:01.090 --> 40:02.580
Was up late, too.

40:02.580 --> 40:03.413
- You sure?

40:03.413 --> 40:04.753
- Yeah, why?

40:06.647 --> 40:07.960
- There was a dead loon nailed to the tree

40:07.960 --> 40:08.900
out in front of my house.

40:08.900 --> 40:10.487
- Oh, dammit.

40:10.487 --> 40:11.320
Jesus.

40:13.090 --> 40:14.640
Who would do a thing like that?

40:16.540 --> 40:17.890
You can't kill loons,

40:17.890 --> 40:21.240
they're the state bird,
for crying out loud.

40:21.240 --> 40:22.820
- I have no clue who did it.

40:22.820 --> 40:23.653
You wanna go see?

40:23.653 --> 40:24.486
- [Emery] No.

40:24.486 --> 40:25.319
- It's there.

40:26.160 --> 40:27.960
- Well, I believe you.

40:27.960 --> 40:29.743
Kids are gettin' worse these days.

40:30.830 --> 40:33.763
- You know I just came here
for a little peace and quiet?

40:34.610 --> 40:35.443
Get left alone.

40:36.820 --> 40:38.720
Now I have to deal with all this shit.

40:40.640 --> 40:44.320
- Nobody comes here for peace and quiet.

40:44.320 --> 40:46.187
In fact, nobody comes here at all.

40:51.430 --> 40:53.110
I've seen that look.

40:53.110 --> 40:55.100
You have in your eyes before.

40:55.100 --> 40:56.783
It's never a good thing.

40:58.240 --> 41:01.833
Son, what's bugging you?
(somber music)

41:04.903 --> 41:09.820
- I lost my wife in a car
accident about three months back.

41:15.585 --> 41:16.585
- I'm sorry.

41:19.520 --> 41:23.813
I know it's not the same thing,

41:25.700 --> 41:30.027
but my wife passed 'bout five years back.

41:33.040 --> 41:35.323
Married almost 60 years.

41:38.560 --> 41:42.493
I'm not gonna lie to you
and say it gets any better.

41:44.110 --> 41:46.463
My faith gets me through it,

41:47.460 --> 41:49.993
knowing I'll see here again one day.

41:54.805 --> 41:56.155
- We were gonna be parents.

41:59.370 --> 42:02.563
When my wife died, my faith died with her.

42:05.338 --> 42:07.710
I just can't stop thinking about that.

42:07.710 --> 42:09.133
What if this is it?

42:11.824 --> 42:13.574
What if there's nothing left after?

42:16.310 --> 42:20.383
- That's a sad way to look at life, son.

42:21.640 --> 42:24.760
We have to believe that
there's more to life

42:24.760 --> 42:26.093
than what we can see.

42:29.290 --> 42:30.590
- Right now, I just can't.

42:35.630 --> 42:38.763
- My heart breaks for you.

42:40.470 --> 42:45.470
Should your mind drift
back to painful memories,

42:49.720 --> 42:51.583
then you need to talk some more.

42:54.610 --> 42:55.933
You know where I am.

42:57.298 --> 42:58.298
- Thank you.

43:02.763 --> 43:04.846
(tranquil music)

43:49.222 --> 43:52.222
(frightening music)

43:57.660 --> 43:58.493
Hey,

43:59.620 --> 44:01.170
hey what are you doing in here?

44:02.337 --> 44:03.538
Hey.

44:03.538 --> 44:05.096
Get out of here.

44:05.096 --> 44:08.179
(corn stalks rustle)

44:24.864 --> 44:25.697
(baby cries)

44:25.697 --> 44:27.994
(woman sings softly)

44:27.994 --> 44:30.494
(eerie music)

44:32.456 --> 44:33.289
Ashley.

44:39.041 --> 44:39.874
Ashley.

44:41.806 --> 44:44.889
(eerie violin music)

44:51.094 --> 44:51.927
Ashley.

44:56.788 --> 44:57.621
Ashley.

45:00.838 --> 45:01.671
Ashley.

45:04.847 --> 45:08.430
(intensely ominous music)

45:26.555 --> 45:29.025
(lightning crashes)
(thunder rumbles)

45:29.025 --> 45:31.108
(dramatic music)

45:33.506 --> 45:36.089
(rain patters)

45:47.252 --> 45:49.919
(mud squelches)

46:09.314 --> 46:11.981
(water patters)

46:20.141 --> 46:22.974
(thunder rumbles)

46:27.653 --> 46:28.486
(thunder crashes loudly)

46:28.486 --> 46:31.313
(suspenseful music)

46:31.313 --> 46:32.146
Shit.

46:33.038 --> 46:35.538
(eerie music)

46:51.766 --> 46:54.433
(sighs) Dammit.

46:57.375 --> 47:00.354
(ominous music)

47:00.354 --> 47:02.854
(eerie music)

47:27.143 --> 47:29.726
(stairs creak)

47:51.674 --> 47:54.424
(switches click)

47:57.994 --> 48:00.494
(lights whir)

48:02.572 --> 48:05.322
(footsteps thud)

48:07.287 --> 48:10.271
(eerie music)

48:10.271 --> 48:12.771
(wood creaks)

48:25.857 --> 48:27.662
(suspenseful music)

48:27.662 --> 48:30.162
(wood creaks)

49:02.254 --> 49:04.837
(rain patters)

49:09.232 --> 49:11.732
(wood creaks)

49:12.903 --> 49:15.403
(Louis yells)

49:24.181 --> 49:27.014
(thunder crashes)

49:28.060 --> 49:31.060
(frightening music)

49:44.123 --> 49:46.009
(door knocks)

49:46.009 --> 49:47.188
(door knocks)

49:47.188 --> 49:48.021
- Louis.

49:55.615 --> 49:56.448
Louis.

50:02.797 --> 50:05.160
- What are you doing here?

50:05.160 --> 50:06.440
- Well, I thought you hadn't eaten,

50:06.440 --> 50:08.423
so I just brought some food.

50:17.500 --> 50:18.380
Can I come in?

50:18.380 --> 50:19.213
It's raining.

50:21.350 --> 50:22.183
- Yeah.

50:23.036 --> 50:23.869
Yeah.

50:23.869 --> 50:24.702
- Thanks.

50:28.928 --> 50:30.840
- Let me put some clothes on.

50:30.840 --> 50:32.330
- Hey, it's your place.

50:32.330 --> 50:33.280
Do what feels good.

50:38.630 --> 50:39.730
- Are you sure you didn't see anybody

50:39.730 --> 50:41.373
run out of the house when you pulled up?

50:42.580 --> 50:43.535
- No.

50:43.535 --> 50:46.000
(thunder rumbles)

50:46.000 --> 50:46.833
- Are you sure?

50:47.730 --> 50:49.230
Not a woman?

50:49.230 --> 50:50.063
Anybody?

50:51.390 --> 50:52.960
- No, I just saw the lights come on,

50:52.960 --> 50:54.160
so I knew you were here.

50:56.730 --> 50:58.830
- I Heard somebody walking around up here.

51:01.230 --> 51:04.510
- Look at you, scared of a little wind

51:04.510 --> 51:06.310
blowing through an old house.

51:06.310 --> 51:07.660
You remind me of my nephew.

51:10.270 --> 51:12.203
- You heard me at the bar the other night.

51:13.850 --> 51:15.200
I was out at that cemetery.

51:17.233 --> 51:20.238
I think I might have
crossed that witch's grave.

51:20.238 --> 51:22.740
- (scoffs) Mary Jane's grave?

51:22.740 --> 51:24.410
That's just a story.

51:24.410 --> 51:25.630
Do you know how many
times when we were kids

51:25.630 --> 51:27.333
we would jump across that grave?

51:28.890 --> 51:29.913
There's no witch.

51:31.060 --> 51:34.263
She was just some poor girl.

51:37.473 --> 51:39.164
(screams)

51:39.164 --> 51:41.247
(laughs)

51:45.680 --> 51:48.260
- Who needs a witch to scare
me when I have you, huh?

51:48.260 --> 51:49.607
- Chicken shit city boy.

51:51.125 --> 51:54.300
(crickets chirp)

51:54.300 --> 51:56.870
- So, why didn't you
just go stay with family

51:56.870 --> 51:59.237
instead of coming out here all alone?

52:02.294 --> 52:03.244
- I never knew 'em.

52:07.123 --> 52:09.393
I was in and out of foster
homes my whole life.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.080
I met Ashley in college.

52:17.840 --> 52:18.683
She saved me.

52:21.760 --> 52:22.923
She became my family.

52:31.350 --> 52:32.573
One year, for Christmas,

52:33.960 --> 52:35.760
we decided to go to the Black Hills.

52:38.560 --> 52:40.313
This huge blizzard came through.

52:42.660 --> 52:44.313
We got snowed in for four days.

52:46.500 --> 52:47.723
Nobody could get to us.

52:49.202 --> 52:50.202
We couldn't get out.

52:53.080 --> 52:54.230
But that didn't matter.

52:59.021 --> 53:01.371
I'd give anything to have
those four days back.

53:06.940 --> 53:09.983
- How did she die, if
you don't mind my asking?

53:14.200 --> 53:15.033
- Car accident.

53:17.405 --> 53:19.840
(somber music)

53:19.840 --> 53:22.140
She was on her way home
from a church meeting.

53:25.212 --> 53:27.520
I was still at work when it happened.

53:32.117 --> 53:35.950
I lost everything I had
and loved, in seconds.

53:40.589 --> 53:42.006
I don't know why.

53:45.387 --> 53:50.387
If that's the way God
is, cruel and malignant,

53:54.160 --> 53:56.510
I choose not to put my
faith in him any longer.

54:03.176 --> 54:05.676
- Do you believe in the devil?

54:11.037 --> 54:11.870
- I guess,

54:14.133 --> 54:16.517
if I believe in God,

54:16.517 --> 54:19.113
I'd have to say yeah,
the devil would exist.

54:22.560 --> 54:25.510
- Earlier, you said you thought
a ghost was disturbing you,

54:26.851 --> 54:29.560
and if you believe ghosts are real

54:29.560 --> 54:31.960
and that you disturbed
one down by the cemetery,

54:32.800 --> 54:36.330
then you'd have to believe

54:36.330 --> 54:39.090
that other forces, like God and the devil,

54:39.090 --> 54:40.063
must exist too.

54:44.646 --> 54:46.813
- What are you getting at?

54:48.237 --> 54:49.637
- If you believe in nothing,

54:52.211 --> 54:56.878
then you don't have anything
to be frightened of at all.

55:06.899 --> 55:08.673
(sighs)

55:08.673 --> 55:09.863
I don't hear thunder.

55:11.880 --> 55:13.180
The storm must be passing.

55:21.490 --> 55:23.190
- Thanks for staying here with me.

55:24.940 --> 55:26.440
As much as I want to be alone,

55:27.990 --> 55:29.490
I don't think I could tonight.

55:34.201 --> 55:39.201
- It's okay.

55:39.477 --> 55:41.560
(pensive music)

55:59.810 --> 56:01.959
(wings flap)

56:01.959 --> 56:03.916
(wings flap)

56:03.916 --> 56:06.666
(loon calls)

56:14.480 --> 56:15.313
- Owen,

56:16.820 --> 56:19.467
I have always respected you
as a pillar of the community

56:19.467 --> 56:20.890
and a man of God,

56:20.890 --> 56:25.653
but now when I hear you
speak the words of the Lord,

56:27.560 --> 56:29.870
your faith isn't there.

56:29.870 --> 56:31.483
- Pay me no heed, Lena.

56:32.950 --> 56:35.883
- No, we cannot ignore this.

56:37.110 --> 56:38.600
Something's infected you.

56:38.600 --> 56:40.033
We all feel it.

56:41.942 --> 56:43.430
It's as though something dark

56:43.430 --> 56:45.520
has slithered into our lives

56:45.520 --> 56:47.393
and coiled itself around you.

56:50.232 --> 56:53.050
You are no longer the man that I married.

56:55.400 --> 56:57.570
You were always so compassionate,

56:57.570 --> 57:00.490
so forgiving, always looking
at the best in people,

57:00.490 --> 57:05.490
and now there's something
in you that frightens me.

57:07.810 --> 57:12.083
- Do you know what our
son told me that night?

57:13.567 --> 57:17.307
"There is no God.
(somber music)

57:17.307 --> 57:18.657
"There is no God."

57:20.733 --> 57:22.253
And then he took his life.

57:24.067 --> 57:26.643
- Why have you never told me that before?

57:26.643 --> 57:28.073
- Because I never believed,

57:29.760 --> 57:34.300
yet still, after almost a year,

57:34.300 --> 57:37.853
our youngest son's final words haunt me.

57:40.200 --> 57:41.843
What if he spoke the truth?

57:43.330 --> 57:44.163
- Don't.

57:45.660 --> 57:46.863
Don't say such things.

57:48.410 --> 57:49.890
How can you say such things?

57:49.890 --> 57:51.643
You're a servant of God.

57:52.790 --> 57:55.853
Don't turn your back on
him after all these years.

57:56.890 --> 58:01.890
- What God sends madness into my child

58:01.960 --> 58:06.430
and then burns his soul
to everlasting flame?

58:06.430 --> 58:09.063
- Samuel is our child.

58:11.150 --> 58:13.410
How dare you be so selfish

58:13.410 --> 58:15.893
as to think his death only affected you.

58:19.040 --> 58:20.090
It's God's will.

58:21.530 --> 58:22.773
He's testing us.

58:24.160 --> 58:25.393
Don't abandon him.

58:26.610 --> 58:29.493
- You believe this is a test?

58:31.610 --> 58:32.610
- I must believe it,

58:33.700 --> 58:38.333
and you, you of all men
must be believe it too.

58:43.870 --> 58:44.703
- No.

58:52.490 --> 58:54.933
I cannot, any longer.

58:57.340 --> 59:00.090
(dramatic music)

59:01.577 --> 59:04.160
- Then there's no hope for you.

59:05.450 --> 59:07.573
You have forsaken your people.

59:09.660 --> 59:12.563
This darkness that's descended on us,

59:14.530 --> 59:16.610
it's all due to you.

59:16.610 --> 59:19.960
- Do not put that upon me.

59:19.960 --> 59:20.793
- I didn't.

59:21.940 --> 59:25.323
You brought it on yourself
when you gave up your faith.

59:38.125 --> 59:42.958
(crickets chirp)
(somber music)

59:51.612 --> 59:54.862
(woman chants faintly)

59:56.616 --> 59:58.366
- Bless us with rain.

59:59.709 --> 01:00:00.709
Hear me now,

01:00:02.858 --> 01:00:04.275
as I summon thee.

01:00:07.883 --> 01:00:09.493
Bring us a storm,

01:00:11.443 --> 01:00:13.556
to thrive once more.

01:00:13.556 --> 01:00:14.686
(fire roars)
- What are you doing

01:00:14.686 --> 01:00:15.936
in these woods?

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:22.483
- God is everywhere in nature.

01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:29.253
Can you not feel his
presence between us now?

01:00:33.450 --> 01:00:34.400
I give an offering.

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:36.413
- It's you.

01:00:39.395 --> 01:00:44.173
You have brought this
plague upon our community.

01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:51.417
You are why our crops grow no longer.

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:54.760
- The only darkness here

01:00:56.730 --> 01:00:58.573
is that which stirs within you.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.613
Look upon yourself, pastor.

01:01:07.504 --> 01:01:09.023
The leader of this community,

01:01:09.915 --> 01:01:12.203
the shepard to this flock,

01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:16.403
forsaken and corrupted.

01:01:19.664 --> 01:01:21.910
And you blame me for the crops?

01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:26.063
- That day,

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:29.213
at the church,

01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:36.230
it was you, you tempted me.

01:01:37.657 --> 01:01:39.113
It was all your doing.

01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:42.543
It was no sin of mine.

01:01:44.442 --> 01:01:46.609
- I offered no temptation.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:53.087
It was your own free
will which desired me,

01:01:53.087 --> 01:01:56.133
and which still desires me now.

01:02:05.290 --> 01:02:07.023
The blood of this dead loon,

01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:12.103
purified in the flames,
shall revitalize the soil,

01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:15.583
and our crops shall grow once more.

01:02:20.318 --> 01:02:24.151
(intensifying dramatic music)

01:02:39.525 --> 01:02:42.358
(flesh squelches)

01:02:53.144 --> 01:02:55.894
(flames crackle)

01:02:58.409 --> 01:03:01.159
(flames crackle)

01:03:02.698 --> 01:03:05.448
(flames crackle)

01:03:08.042 --> 01:03:10.792
(flames crackle)

01:04:04.809 --> 01:04:06.809
(gasps)

01:04:09.531 --> 01:04:10.531
- Oh my God.

01:04:11.618 --> 01:04:13.118
What have we done?

01:04:15.973 --> 01:04:18.306
- We have given an offering.

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:26.256
Soon the rains will come.

01:04:26.256 --> 01:04:29.089
(thunder rumbles)

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.737
- You witch, you've bedeviled me.

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:40.463
- 'Twas no bedeviling.

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.197
You were willing.

01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:50.943
Your son, Samuel,

01:04:54.168 --> 01:04:57.760
(intensifying dramatic music)

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.513
was always willing.

01:05:03.944 --> 01:05:05.944
(gasps)

01:05:08.678 --> 01:05:10.428
- I will destroy you.

01:05:11.272 --> 01:05:12.189
- Go ahead.

01:05:13.627 --> 01:05:16.500
If I am a witch, I will
do more harm to you

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.903
than anything that you could do to me.

01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:22.023
Warn the town about me,

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:26.063
and I will burn your church to the ground.

01:05:27.330 --> 01:05:31.153
Torture me, and you will know such pain

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.650
as you have never imagined.

01:05:36.539 --> 01:05:37.372
Kill me,

01:05:40.305 --> 01:05:42.805
and I will rise from the grave

01:05:44.628 --> 01:05:47.461
and drag you back to Hell with me.

01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:50.247
- I rebuke you.

01:05:50.247 --> 01:05:51.660
(Mary Jane laughs)

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:53.880
- God is on my side.

01:05:55.050 --> 01:05:55.883
- Is he?

01:05:58.470 --> 01:06:00.693
I thought you rebuked him.

01:06:09.166 --> 01:06:10.950
(mystical music)

01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:12.653
We are the damned.

01:06:15.690 --> 01:06:16.967
Are we not, Louis?

01:06:22.999 --> 01:06:25.666
(fire crackles)

01:06:36.310 --> 01:06:37.143
- Gracie?

01:06:49.678 --> 01:06:51.146
Gracie.

01:06:51.146 --> 01:06:53.646
(door knocks)

01:07:12.827 --> 01:07:15.577
(crickets chirp)

01:07:26.026 --> 01:07:26.859
Ashley.

01:07:28.743 --> 01:07:30.660
- Can I come in, Louis?

01:07:33.414 --> 01:07:34.664
I feel so cold.

01:07:36.907 --> 01:07:41.907
(screams)
(frightening music)

01:07:43.337 --> 01:07:45.199
(Gracie gasps)

01:07:45.199 --> 01:07:46.605
- What the hell is wrong with you?

01:07:46.605 --> 01:07:47.438
- Gracie.

01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:48.271
- No, stay away from me.

01:07:48.271 --> 01:07:49.631
- Just listen.

01:07:49.631 --> 01:07:50.500
- You're crazy.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.510
- Gracie, just let me explain, okay?

01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:53.500
Gracie.

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.110
Gracie.

01:07:55.110 --> 01:07:56.333
Let me explain.

01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:58.593
I'm sorry.

01:08:00.091 --> 01:08:02.050
(engine revs)

01:08:02.050 --> 01:08:02.883
Gracie.

01:08:07.796 --> 01:08:09.796
(sighs)

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:21.020
(eerie music)

01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:02.560
(door knocks)

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:05.120
- Hey, everything okay?

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.870
I just saw Gracie's
car tearing out of here

01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:08.220
like a bat outta hell.

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:09.456
You okay, son?

01:09:09.456 --> 01:09:11.419
- Emery, look at this.

01:09:11.419 --> 01:09:12.252
Look.

01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:14.622
- Loon Lake.

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.399
- Yeah, look, in the trees.

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:18.233
- Where?

01:09:18.233 --> 01:09:19.066
- Right there.

01:09:19.932 --> 01:09:20.765
- What?

01:09:22.103 --> 01:09:22.935
I don't know what you're looking at.

01:09:22.935 --> 01:09:24.399
- There was someone in the trees.

01:09:24.399 --> 01:09:26.013
- I don't see anything.

01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:30.403
You okay?

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:32.513
What's wrong?

01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:34.710
- That witch at Loon Lake,

01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:37.330
I think she's after me.

01:09:38.359 --> 01:09:39.810
I think I walked across her grave.

01:09:39.810 --> 01:09:42.210
- There's no witch out there.

01:09:42.210 --> 01:09:43.229
- That's not what I've heard.

01:09:43.229 --> 01:09:44.680
- They filled your head with nonsense,

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.080
at the bar, didn't they?

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:47.383
Yeah, I knew it.

01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:53.210
You wanna know the truth?

01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:54.490
- Please.

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:56.180
- It was a drought year.

01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:59.093
The crops were dying,
animals were diseased.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.923
My great-great-grandfather
was a pastor back then,

01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:07.143
and he and the rest of the
township, I'm sorry to say,

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:12.973
accused some poor, misunderstood
girl of witchcraft,

01:10:14.230 --> 01:10:15.763
saying she cursed the land.

01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:18.453
So they killed her,

01:10:19.930 --> 01:10:21.453
buried her out at the lake,

01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:25.063
thinkin' it would solve their problems.

01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:27.003
But it didn't.

01:10:28.173 --> 01:10:30.988
(thunder rumbles)
(somber music)

01:10:30.988 --> 01:10:33.405
(desk bangs)

01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:40.623
- I rid the community of her evil, Lord.

01:10:43.210 --> 01:10:44.253
For you.

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:50.143
Now she is dead.

01:10:52.184 --> 01:10:55.017
(thunder rumbles)

01:10:56.310 --> 01:11:01.310
I cannot believe my son burns in eternity.

01:11:10.225 --> 01:11:11.058
I cannot.

01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:15.804
Oh, God.

01:11:21.387 --> 01:11:24.383
Do you hear me, God?

01:11:29.404 --> 01:11:30.793
Are you listening?

01:11:37.123 --> 01:11:38.623
Are you listening?

01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:50.843
If you hear,

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.563
God,

01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:58.713
then please,

01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:02.737
I beg you,

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:13.750
stop your house

01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:20.043
from burning to the ground.

01:12:21.836 --> 01:12:25.329
(dramatic music)

01:12:25.329 --> 01:12:30.017
(thunder crashes)
(Pastor Janson yells)

01:12:30.017 --> 01:12:34.620
- Everybody blamed Mary Jane and her curse

01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:36.020
for the church burning down.

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:42.003
They've been spreading ghost
stories about them every since.

01:12:43.979 --> 01:12:47.210
I wish they would stop.

01:12:47.210 --> 01:12:50.693
The whole thing was tragic.

01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:54.190
- [Louis] But people have died, Emery.

01:12:54.190 --> 01:12:57.587
- It's all coincidence,
superstition, ignorance.

01:12:57.587 --> 01:12:58.420
- [Louis] But--

01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:01.930
- When I was a kid,
someone dared Bill Hopkins

01:13:01.930 --> 01:13:05.270
to walk across the witch grave
three times, so he did it.

01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:07.350
Three days later, he died.

01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:08.183
- Three days?

01:13:08.183 --> 01:13:11.170
- Yes, but it wasn't Mary Jane who did it.

01:13:11.170 --> 01:13:13.760
That night, he was drunk, as always.

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.330
Ran his car into a telephone pole.

01:13:16.330 --> 01:13:19.880
There's nothing supernatural about that.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.410
- But he still died, Emery.

01:13:22.410 --> 01:13:23.940
There's something out there, okay?

01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:25.160
I know it.

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.580
How can I be seeing all
this shit in my head

01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:28.590
if it's all just
superstitions and stories?

01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:31.003
- There's no such thing as witches.

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.030
You know, what people can't understand,

01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:37.363
they fear, call it evil.

01:13:38.210 --> 01:13:40.573
Mary Jane was an outsider.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:44.263
People punished her
because she was different.

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:50.283
Fear does crazy things.

01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:58.150
Your mind's playing tricks on you.

01:13:58.150 --> 01:13:58.983
- You're right.

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:01.470
I've been overreacting.

01:14:03.223 --> 01:14:04.140
- Yeah.

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:05.733
- I think I'm gonna go lie down.

01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:07.883
- Good idea.

01:14:10.379 --> 01:14:11.212
- Yeah.

01:14:18.032 --> 01:14:20.532
(eerie music)

01:14:40.968 --> 01:14:42.130
(wind blows)

01:14:42.130 --> 01:14:44.190
Can I help you gentlemen?

01:14:44.190 --> 01:14:45.193
- Yes, you can.

01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:49.767
Heard you attacked my sister.

01:14:49.767 --> 01:14:50.600
- [Louis] Huh?

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.190
- That shit don't go around here.

01:14:52.190 --> 01:14:53.590
- Shit don't go around here.

01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:57.180
- Look, all right,
that's not what happened.

01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:58.480
- I don't care what you say happened.

01:14:58.480 --> 01:14:59.650
She says you hurt her.

01:14:59.650 --> 01:15:01.742
- All right, if we could just
talk about this for a little--

01:15:01.742 --> 01:15:03.738
- [Gracie] Stop.

01:15:03.738 --> 01:15:04.571
Leave him alone.

01:15:04.571 --> 01:15:06.582
- Gracie, shut up and
get back in the truck.

01:15:06.582 --> 01:15:08.630
This is between me and him.
- I said he didn't mean it.

01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:11.480
- We're gonna show this city
boy how we work around here.

01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:16.960
Come here, guy.

01:15:18.175 --> 01:15:20.435
(corn stalks rustle)

01:15:20.435 --> 01:15:21.268
(wings flap)

01:15:21.268 --> 01:15:23.748
(loon calls)

01:15:23.748 --> 01:15:26.248
(eerie music)

01:15:46.485 --> 01:15:49.152
(stone scrapes)

01:15:55.031 --> 01:15:57.614
- Why are you doing this to me?

01:15:59.635 --> 01:16:02.385
- If only they had left me alone.

01:16:03.403 --> 01:16:05.773
If only you hadn't woken me.

01:16:11.132 --> 01:16:13.934
- But I didn't do anything.

01:16:13.934 --> 01:16:14.984
I don't deserve this.

01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:17.863
- I didn't deserve it either.

01:16:22.869 --> 01:16:24.819
- Why are you showing me these visions?

01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:29.903
- So that you will understand.

01:16:33.806 --> 01:16:35.606
- I don't care what happened to you.

01:16:37.108 --> 01:16:39.108
I just want this to end.

01:16:44.554 --> 01:16:46.976
- It shall all be over soon.

01:16:46.976 --> 01:16:50.393
(animals call distantly)

01:17:16.513 --> 01:17:19.793
I feel the strength
returning to me already.

01:17:33.282 --> 01:17:36.032
I can make your pain all go away.

01:17:40.881 --> 01:17:41.714
And now,

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:50.483
it is sealed.

01:17:54.713 --> 01:17:57.630
Kind friend, beware as you pass by.

01:18:01.885 --> 01:18:04.385
As you are now, so once was I.

01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:09.113
As I am now, so you must be.

01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:15.939
Prepare yourself to follow me.

01:18:28.996 --> 01:18:31.641
(somber music)

01:18:31.641 --> 01:18:32.641
- Oh my God.

01:18:34.467 --> 01:18:35.837
Ashley.

01:18:35.837 --> 01:18:37.216
- Louis.

01:18:37.216 --> 01:18:39.102
- I'm so sorry.

01:18:39.102 --> 01:18:41.935
I should have been there with you.

01:18:43.328 --> 01:18:45.578
- You can't blame yourself.

01:18:47.016 --> 01:18:48.829
- I have you now.

01:18:48.829 --> 01:18:50.829
I'm gonna keep you safe.

01:18:53.417 --> 01:18:54.417
- You can't.

01:18:55.784 --> 01:18:58.200
But I can save you.

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:01.283
(eerie violin music)

01:19:21.917 --> 01:19:23.217
- "Kind friend, take heed,

01:19:24.127 --> 01:19:26.713
"as on this path, you must proceed.

01:19:27.727 --> 01:19:30.153
"If this grave has thrice been tread,

01:19:31.964 --> 01:19:34.863
"call her forth from the undead.

01:19:35.967 --> 01:19:39.313
"Take up an ax, which failed at first,

01:19:40.267 --> 01:19:44.560
"and with one swing, remove the curse."

01:19:47.979 --> 01:19:49.351
- [Woman] Believe, Louis.

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:51.687
(Louis gasps)

01:19:51.687 --> 01:19:54.270
(Louis coughs)

01:20:17.286 --> 01:20:19.869
(Louis grunts)

01:20:26.377 --> 01:20:29.294
(foreboding music)

01:20:52.516 --> 01:20:55.099
(Louis grunts)

01:21:05.578 --> 01:21:07.661
- Mary Jane, come for me.

01:21:10.939 --> 01:21:12.439
I'm ready for you.

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.050
I'm right here.

01:21:18.967 --> 01:21:23.271
(shed bangs)
(suspenseful music)

01:21:23.271 --> 01:21:26.688
(Louis breathes heavily)

01:21:31.026 --> 01:21:33.443
(door bangs)

01:21:36.103 --> 01:21:38.520
(door bangs)

01:22:05.737 --> 01:22:08.237
(eerie music)

01:22:12.143 --> 01:22:12.976
Mary Jane.

01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:44.653
(somber music)

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.883
I love you, Ashley.

01:22:52.670 --> 01:22:53.983
I miss you so much.

01:22:56.670 --> 01:22:57.503
If this is real,

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.550
this is really happening to me,

01:23:07.313 --> 01:23:08.363
help me, Ash.

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:12.830
How am I gonna do this?

01:23:19.629 --> 01:23:21.712
(somber piano music)

01:23:48.376 --> 01:23:50.671
(invigorating music)

01:23:50.671 --> 01:23:51.504
Okay.

01:24:00.444 --> 01:24:03.194
(crickets chirp)

01:24:49.424 --> 01:24:51.507
(somber music)

01:25:27.292 --> 01:25:29.322
(glass pane knocks)

01:25:29.322 --> 01:25:30.155
- Hey.

01:25:31.150 --> 01:25:31.983
You okay?

01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:34.610
- You were right.

01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:35.563
It's just a story.

01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:37.323
I overreacted.

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.060
I guess this quiet solitude
doesn't agree with me.

01:25:42.877 --> 01:25:44.627
I'm gonna head back to Minneapolis.

01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:47.360
- I'm sorry to see you go.

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:49.693
You're a good man.

01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:55.193
Take care of yourself, okay?

01:25:56.396 --> 01:25:58.523
- I will.

01:25:58.523 --> 01:26:00.190
Thanks again, Emery.

01:26:01.307 --> 01:26:02.140
- [Emery] So long.

01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:04.223
(somber music)

01:26:39.702 --> 01:26:40.595
(frightening music)

01:26:40.595 --> 01:26:45.512
(tires scrape)
(car bangs)

01:26:54.036 --> 01:26:56.536
(eerie music)

01:27:01.609 --> 01:27:03.609
(yells)

01:27:18.634 --> 01:27:21.134
(eerie music)

01:28:32.303 --> 01:28:35.303
(frightening music)

01:29:09.677 --> 01:29:11.937

01:29:11.937 --> 01:29:14.520
(Louis grunts)

01:29:27.223 --> 01:29:30.140
(Mary Jane growls)

01:29:36.167 --> 01:29:37.500
- [Woman] Louis.

01:29:41.318 --> 01:29:44.235
(Mary Jane growls)

01:29:52.789 --> 01:29:54.872
(dramatic music)

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:37.633
- [Louis] Emery.

01:30:39.050 --> 01:30:39.883
- What's wrong?

01:30:39.883 --> 01:30:40.880
- You were wrong.

01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:42.460
It's not just a story, it's true.

01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:43.750
Here's the proof.

01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:45.300
It's Mary Jane's necklace.

01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:46.794
- No, no, that's not real.

01:30:46.794 --> 01:30:48.252
- Bullshit, Emery.

01:30:48.252 --> 01:30:49.085
Bullshit.

01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:51.563
I'm outta here.

01:30:52.521 --> 01:30:53.354
- Louis.

01:31:03.113 --> 01:31:05.196
(somber music)

01:31:26.769 --> 01:31:28.852
(dramatic music)

01:31:41.281 --> 01:31:46.281
(tires screech)
(car bangs)

01:31:50.448 --> 01:31:53.198
(tranquil music)

01:32:02.351 --> 01:32:03.434
- Oh my gosh.

01:32:08.199 --> 01:32:10.282
(somber music)

01:32:11.613 --> 01:32:13.946
(waves lap)

01:32:31.724 --> 01:32:35.307
- Never believed all
the stories, you know.

01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:05.377
He was a good man.

01:33:23.737 --> 01:33:26.737
(loons call)

01:33:32.775 --> 01:33:35.358
