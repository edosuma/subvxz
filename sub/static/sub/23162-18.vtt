WEBVTT

00:00.051 --> 00:03.714
We're talking about a grown man
seducing a 17-year-old girl.

00:03.788 --> 00:05.278
If you believe the gossip.

00:07.258 --> 00:09.954
But I don't think getting back at
him is gonna make you feel better.

00:10.027 --> 00:13.622
I don't want to get back at him. I
want to find him because he has Jesse.

00:13.697 --> 00:14.925
Jesse?

00:17.701 --> 00:20.864
There is no baby.
Just a lonely girl's fantasy.

00:21.005 --> 00:22.472
Where is Jesse?

00:22.540 --> 00:24.440
I really think you'd
better be going now.

00:24.508 --> 00:27.068
I don't believe that my son
is dead, not for one second.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.542
Because if my son were
dead, I would feel it.

01:57.368 --> 02:00.303
You've already taken
$3,000 of my money.

02:01.572 --> 02:04.336
Yeah, and it's going to take another
grand to keep things going.

02:06.143 --> 02:08.372
Look, that's the way it is
in this business.

02:10.381 --> 02:13.282
I have got a dead-solid
lead going here.

02:14.151 --> 02:15.948
You've told me that before.

02:16.387 --> 02:18.719
You don't want to screw things
up by letting the trail get cold

02:18.789 --> 02:21.724
while you stand around here
trying to make up your mind.

02:22.626 --> 02:24.491
At least let me see
what you've found.

02:27.231 --> 02:29.495
Then you take my lead
and go off without me.

02:30.267 --> 02:32.963
I'm sorry, honey.
Doesn't work that way.

02:33.103 --> 02:35.628
The only person looks at Joe
McKenna's files is Joe McKenna.

02:36.207 --> 02:37.765
It's my way or not at all.

02:40.177 --> 02:42.236
Then I guess it'll
have to be not at all.

02:44.281 --> 02:46.112
If that's the way
you feel about it.

02:51.522 --> 02:53.649
I'm not gonna leave
without my property.

02:53.724 --> 02:54.986
Your property?

02:55.659 --> 02:57.593
Let me tell you something,
young lady.

02:59.230 --> 03:00.595
You're kidding me, right?

03:01.165 --> 03:02.359
It's mine.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.395
I paid for it.

03:05.202 --> 03:06.692
Please give me my file.

03:09.473 --> 03:10.735
Give it to me!

03:10.808 --> 03:14.300
Okay, okay. Just stay calm.
Like I said,

03:14.478 --> 03:15.968
I'll give you your file.

03:19.650 --> 03:21.174
Thank you very much.

03:30.561 --> 03:33.860
Yeah, you're welcome.

03:38.269 --> 03:39.930
Yeah, where to now, lady?

03:42.239 --> 03:44.139
Come on, lady. Where to?

03:44.842 --> 03:46.036
Hawaii.

04:02.192 --> 04:05.628
I must've seen a hundred rainbows
since I've been in the islands.

04:06.630 --> 04:09.622
But each one just seems
to take my breath away.

04:11.535 --> 04:15.562
Despite the best efforts of Mr. Corkill,
my high school science teacher.

04:17.408 --> 04:22.004
He used to lecture our class on
light reflections and refraction,

04:22.079 --> 04:24.274
polarization and prisms,
but I knew.

04:24.715 --> 04:28.344
I knew that that really wasn't
what rainbows were all about.

04:28.652 --> 04:30.847
So when I got a C-minus
on my midterm,

04:32.089 --> 04:35.490
Mr. Corkill told me that he was really
worried that I would go through life

04:35.592 --> 04:39.494
not understanding the importance
of geometrical optics.

04:41.732 --> 04:44.701
But to tell you the truth,
I was a lot more worried.

04:44.802 --> 04:48.795
Mr. Corkill might go through life not
understanding the importance of a rainbow.

04:51.542 --> 04:54.204
I'm sorry.
Did you say something?

04:57.314 --> 04:58.474
Yes.

05:00.684 --> 05:02.618
I was just talking
about the rainbow.

05:04.088 --> 05:05.385
It's very pretty.

05:07.291 --> 05:10.385
You know, I must've seen a hundred
rainbows since I've been in the islands,

05:10.461 --> 05:13.089
but you know, each and every
one of them just...

05:13.163 --> 05:14.926
- It just takes my breath...
- Mr. Magnum?

05:14.998 --> 05:15.998
What?

05:17.434 --> 05:18.696
Lydia McCarthy.

05:19.203 --> 05:20.602
I'm sorry I'm late.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.073
Oh, well, that's okay.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.506
I got held up.

05:28.812 --> 05:30.143
See you around.

05:30.647 --> 05:32.615
Wait! Can you still see me?

05:34.785 --> 05:36.082
Of course.

05:45.362 --> 05:48.297
I've been interviewing with
private detectives all morning,

05:48.365 --> 05:52.392
and when I asked who was the number
one investigator on the island,

05:52.836 --> 05:54.303
your name kept coming up.

05:55.139 --> 05:56.572
Really? Mmm-hmm.

05:56.673 --> 05:58.641
That's very flattering
to know that my

05:58.909 --> 06:01.343
fellow professionals
told you I was the best.

06:01.545 --> 06:04.844
Well, actually, your fellow professionals
told me they were the best.

06:04.948 --> 06:05.948
Oh.

06:06.016 --> 06:07.313
You were number two.

06:08.452 --> 06:09.510
Number two?

06:09.787 --> 06:11.448
Yeah. It was unanimous.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.946
Well, almost unanimous.

06:14.358 --> 06:16.849
And human nature being what
it is, I think that means

06:17.127 --> 06:18.321
you're probably the best.

06:18.395 --> 06:20.488
Thomas, do you still
want that order?

06:21.031 --> 06:22.055
Oh!

06:22.366 --> 06:23.390
That's okay, Rosine.

06:23.467 --> 06:26.231
Oh, please. Have
whatever you want.

06:27.237 --> 06:30.365
Bring Mr. Magnum whatever he's ordered
and I'll have one of the same.

06:30.441 --> 06:32.204
No, no,
she will not have the same.

06:32.309 --> 06:35.039
Mr. Magnum, believe me, I can afford it.
Don't worry about it.

06:35.112 --> 06:36.552
No, I wasn't
worried about the money.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.171
Oh, you think I'm not
old enough to drink?

06:38.248 --> 06:41.308
No, I didn't say that. That's not what
I meant. Because I'm 21 years old.

06:41.385 --> 06:44.081
That's old enough to drink
in any state in the union.

06:44.254 --> 06:46.688
I'd appreciate it if you
wouldn't treat me like a child.

06:46.790 --> 06:49.258
I wasn't. I wasn't.
I wasn't. I'm not.

06:49.393 --> 06:50.393
It's just that...

06:52.296 --> 06:54.764
I just don't drink when
I'm meeting with a client.

06:56.066 --> 06:58.330
Bring her whatever she wants.
I'll have a cup of coffee.

06:58.869 --> 07:00.734
- Okay.
- Thank you.

07:07.878 --> 07:11.041
I want you to find this man.
His name is Donald Burns.

07:12.316 --> 07:13.374
Why?

07:14.852 --> 07:16.080
Why are you looking for him?

07:16.153 --> 07:19.782
He stole some jewelry from me.
A strand of pearls.

07:20.457 --> 07:22.925
I was told he came out
here from New York.

07:23.760 --> 07:26.957
Well, why don't you let the New
York and Honolulu Police handle it?

07:28.665 --> 07:30.565
I don't want him to go to jail.

07:31.435 --> 07:32.732
He's a thief.

07:35.072 --> 07:38.599
Mr. Magnum, maybe there's
something that you don't...

07:45.749 --> 07:49.241
He was our family chauffeur
for nearly 10 years.

07:49.319 --> 07:52.152
And I just... I don't want
him to get in trouble.

07:54.625 --> 07:55.990
What is this?

07:56.059 --> 07:57.151
Your beer.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.796
I hate beer.
I didn't order beer.

08:02.065 --> 08:05.626
Well, yes, you did. You said, "Whatever Mr.
Magnum is having."

08:05.936 --> 08:08.461
Mr. Magnum is having coffee.

08:08.705 --> 08:10.138
I think I can solve this.

08:16.547 --> 08:20.813
Mr. Magnum, this necklace
is a family heirloom.

08:21.451 --> 08:23.442
It's very important
that I get it back.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.783
Here's $500 to get you started.
Oh, no.

08:26.990 --> 08:28.890
Please, don't give me
any money now.

08:29.726 --> 08:30.726
All right.

08:31.795 --> 08:36.027
I understand that he came here to
work for a Loretta Vanderpost.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.332
Loretta Zachary Vanderpost?

08:44.308 --> 08:46.333
Do you think you can
get in to see her?

09:01.158 --> 09:03.319
I know what you're thinking,
and you're right.

09:04.528 --> 09:08.521
Why was I taking on a mundane case
about a missing string of pearls

09:08.632 --> 09:12.329
and a client who had an annoying habit
of treating the world like hired help?

09:12.869 --> 09:16.669
Not that I couldn't use a quick $500,
that was certainly an incentive.

09:17.374 --> 09:20.810
But the chance to get into
a Loretta Vanderpost party,

09:21.211 --> 09:23.338
something Higgins had
assured me would only happen

09:23.413 --> 09:24.937
when snow fell
on Diamond Head...

09:25.716 --> 09:28.810
I suppose that's what actually
finalized my decision.

09:29.419 --> 09:30.943
Oh, my God!

09:31.622 --> 09:35.251
Higgins, don't. Don't. Don't do
what I know you're going to do.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.793
Leave the premises immediately
before someone sees you.

09:37.861 --> 09:40.159
See? You're getting
all worked up again.

09:40.263 --> 09:42.959
I have a perfectly valid reason for
being here. Don't you want to hear it?

09:43.066 --> 09:44.192
Certainly not.

09:44.468 --> 09:45.662
I do.

09:47.504 --> 09:51.270
Hi. I'm Susan Brandes.
I do volunteer legal work

09:51.341 --> 09:53.332
for this little band
of juvenile delinquents

09:53.477 --> 09:56.469
that Lally likes to think
of as "under-encouraged."

09:57.047 --> 09:58.708
And you are? Uninvited.

10:00.050 --> 10:01.381
Thomas Magnum.

10:01.485 --> 10:04.511
Come on, Higgins. I'm sure if Lally
knew me, she would've invited me.

10:04.655 --> 10:06.646
This is an inexcusable
breach of decorum.

10:06.723 --> 10:08.190
Please leave immediately.
Yoo-hoo!

10:08.492 --> 10:09.686
Oh, Jonny!

10:11.428 --> 10:12.690
Lally.

10:12.763 --> 10:14.560
Oh, good. You've met Susan.

10:14.665 --> 10:17.190
Now isn't she everything I
told you she'd be? Indeed.

10:17.601 --> 10:20.195
And he's even more charming
than you said he was.

10:20.470 --> 10:22.495
Oh, you little rascal.

10:22.572 --> 10:23.572
Hi.

10:23.940 --> 10:24.940
Thomas Magnum.

10:25.008 --> 10:27.306
The little rascal brought me, too.
I hope you don't mind.

10:27.477 --> 10:28.569
Mind?

10:28.979 --> 10:30.640
What a delightful
sense of humor.

10:30.714 --> 10:33.308
Why, thank you, Jonny.
How thoughtful.

10:42.092 --> 10:44.856
Camp Kauhale will be
an extraordinary opportunity

10:44.928 --> 10:48.125
for this handful of
young, underprivileged boys.

10:48.465 --> 10:51.093
It was always a big
dream of Chester's.

10:51.601 --> 10:52.693
Chester?

10:52.803 --> 10:54.737
Chester Zachary lll.

10:55.605 --> 10:56.799
Your late husband.

10:56.940 --> 10:58.532
My first late husband.

10:59.176 --> 11:03.044
He used to say, "There's no
such thing as a bad boy."

11:03.380 --> 11:06.508
It was Father Flanagan who said,
"There's no such thing as a bad boy."

11:06.783 --> 11:08.717
Though I'm not convinced
he was right.

11:08.852 --> 11:11.980
Really? I could have
sworn it was Chester.

11:12.322 --> 11:15.314
Now, Gerry, on the other
hand, was entirely opposite.

11:15.525 --> 11:16.617
Gerry?

11:17.527 --> 11:19.495
Your latest late husband?

11:19.663 --> 11:20.994
Colonel Gerald Vanderpost.

11:21.064 --> 11:24.033
A very well known and respected
man of great vision and energy.

11:24.167 --> 11:26.567
He was more like those
young fellows over there.

11:26.703 --> 11:29.001
He couldn't sit still
at a party, either.

11:29.072 --> 11:30.334
I'm going to put a stop to this.

11:30.407 --> 11:31.840
Oh, Jonny, sit down.

11:32.142 --> 11:34.610
They've got the rest of
their lives to behave.

11:35.078 --> 11:37.911
I don't know who would
be more proud of us now,

11:37.981 --> 11:39.642
Chester or Gerry.

11:40.417 --> 11:43.147
Oh, now, what is so
noble about letting

11:43.253 --> 11:46.245
half a dozen young boys
run amok for a week?

11:46.723 --> 11:49.658
Stop trying to be cynical, Susan.
It doesn't become you.

11:51.394 --> 11:53.157
I propose a toast.

11:53.563 --> 11:57.693
To Susan Brandes, for donating
hours and hours of legal work.

11:58.101 --> 11:59.500
And to Jonny,

11:59.903 --> 12:04.067
for generously offering the use
of Robin's Nest for Camp Kauhale.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.670
Robin's Nest.

12:08.445 --> 12:09.912
Bright and early
tomorrow morning.

12:13.316 --> 12:14.943
This has gone too far.

12:15.051 --> 12:17.849
Oh, Jonny, it's only caviar.
Only caviar?

12:17.921 --> 12:19.388
Only caviar?

12:20.157 --> 12:22.853
You! Young man!
Let go of that immediately.

12:35.505 --> 12:36.870
Let me.

12:37.607 --> 12:41.168
I've got plenty of experience
myself with egg on my face.

12:45.248 --> 12:47.773
My first late husband,
Chester, used to say,

12:48.318 --> 12:49.979
"You can spot an honest man"

12:50.053 --> 12:52.044
"the minute he walks
into a place."

12:52.255 --> 12:54.416
Do you think that's true,
Mr. Magnum?

12:56.793 --> 12:58.454
Ms. Vanderpost... Lally.

12:58.662 --> 12:59.662
Lally.

13:00.964 --> 13:02.864
I didn't exactly...

13:04.367 --> 13:06.367
Well, Higgins didn't really
invite me to your party.

13:07.470 --> 13:08.630
I know.

13:11.408 --> 13:13.171
Well, I mean,
we are friends. Well...

13:14.344 --> 13:16.403
We're sort of friends, but he...

13:18.315 --> 13:19.509
You know, he...

13:19.616 --> 13:21.641
That's what I mean
about an honest man.

13:22.319 --> 13:25.254
They can't hide deception even
when it's for a good reason.

13:25.956 --> 13:28.356
I assume you were
lying for a good reason.

13:28.992 --> 13:30.482
I'm a private investigator.

13:32.829 --> 13:35.059
Well, I have a client
who believes

13:35.131 --> 13:37.759
that you might know the
whereabouts of a Donald Burns.

13:39.636 --> 13:43.197
Is your client a young girl
by the name of Lydia McCarthy?

13:47.544 --> 13:49.341
I'm not surprised
she's looking for him.

13:49.412 --> 13:52.438
Though what she's going to do
when she finds him, I don't know.

13:52.983 --> 13:55.577
Well, I'm pretty sure all she
wants is for him to give back

13:55.652 --> 13:56.914
what he took from her.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.452
I'm afraid that's impossible.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.113
If you believe the gossip.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.185
Now, why do I get the feeling

14:05.262 --> 14:08.595
that we're talking about something
other than a strand of pearls?

14:08.665 --> 14:10.064
Because we are.

14:10.767 --> 14:14.703
We're talking about a grown man
seducing a 17-year-old girl.

14:18.675 --> 14:20.165
But you told me you'd find him.

14:20.510 --> 14:23.104
And you told me you were looking
for a strand of pearls.

14:23.246 --> 14:25.407
Look, I'll pay you $1,000.

14:25.482 --> 14:26.915
Money's got
nothing to do with it!

14:26.983 --> 14:29.679
I don't work for clients who lie to me.
It's as simple as that.

14:34.090 --> 14:37.059
Look, I mean, I can understand why you
want to find the guy. No, you can't!

14:37.127 --> 14:39.493
But I don't think getting back at
him is gonna make you feel better

14:39.562 --> 14:41.189
I don't want to get back at him.

14:41.264 --> 14:43.391
I want to find him because

14:43.767 --> 14:44.767
he has Jesse.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.163
Donald stole my little boy.

14:58.229 --> 15:00.197
You should go to
the police, the FBI.

15:00.498 --> 15:01.498
I did.

15:02.299 --> 15:04.824
But a child being stolen
by one of his parents...

15:05.836 --> 15:08.930
They'll look. But they have
so many children to look for.

15:09.073 --> 15:11.166
You're married to Donald?

15:11.742 --> 15:15.303
My relationship with Donald is
really none of your business.

15:16.914 --> 15:20.748
I'm willing to pay you $1,000 to
find him, no questions asked.

15:27.191 --> 15:28.191
Cash.

15:31.996 --> 15:33.258
In advance.

15:46.243 --> 15:49.337
It's dangerous for you to
carry this much cash around.

15:49.480 --> 15:52.040
I'll have the desk clerk
lock it in the safe for you.

16:00.391 --> 16:02.256
Green 45.

16:03.327 --> 16:04.327
Hut.

16:06.797 --> 16:09.391
Yeah! Go get him! Hurry!

16:10.234 --> 16:11.701
Go that way!

16:13.604 --> 16:14.969
No! Go that way!

16:16.040 --> 16:17.234
That way!

16:46.670 --> 16:48.570
Magnum! How could you?

16:49.173 --> 16:50.693
Well, I didn't.
I mean, we were just...

16:50.708 --> 16:52.699
My most prized specimens.

16:55.012 --> 16:56.536
Breakfast!

16:56.981 --> 16:58.278
All right!

16:58.382 --> 16:59.713
Oh, I'm starving!

16:59.783 --> 17:01.341
Come on, let's go!

17:03.420 --> 17:06.877
Remember, Higgins, "There's
no such thing as a bad boy."

17:14.865 --> 17:17.857
T.M., you just weren't
watching where you were going.

17:17.968 --> 17:21.801
The thing is, your mind just
obviously was not on the game.

17:21.906 --> 17:24.026
Yeah, he's still worried
about the case he gave up on.

17:24.074 --> 17:26.338
What case? I did not give
up, and I'm not worried.

17:26.410 --> 17:27.536
All right, guilty, then.

17:27.611 --> 17:29.272
I'm not guilty, either.

17:29.380 --> 17:31.541
Oh, it sounds so mysterious.
What is it?

17:31.916 --> 17:34.111
Drugs? Espionage?

17:35.085 --> 17:36.416
Missing persons.

17:36.520 --> 17:37.680
T.C.

17:38.188 --> 17:40.315
A young girl asked him
to help her find her baby.

17:40.558 --> 17:42.526
I'm not sure what
she's looking for.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.650
And you never will be now.

17:45.296 --> 17:46.923
I'm sorry I mentioned it, okay?

17:46.997 --> 17:48.760
I'm not going
on some wild goose chase

17:48.832 --> 17:51.801
for a client who lies to me because she
thinks money can buy her anything.

17:51.869 --> 17:53.063
I'm not going to do it.

17:53.170 --> 17:55.604
Magnum, telephone.

17:55.873 --> 17:58.307
It's the manager
of the Kolona Reef Hotel.

17:58.375 --> 18:00.172
Something about a Lydia McCarthy

18:00.244 --> 18:02.439
giving your name as
a credit reference.

18:02.913 --> 18:05.882
I assured him that must be some
sort of bizarre practical joke,

18:05.950 --> 18:07.383
but he was most emphatic.

18:07.918 --> 18:09.249
Lydia McCarthy?

18:10.287 --> 18:12.346
I thought she was
the one with all the money.

18:12.423 --> 18:13.515
So did I.

18:13.591 --> 18:16.253
Actually, she's probably
not the real client anyway.

18:16.627 --> 18:19.027
You know, Thomas, you should be
working for that missing kid.

18:19.096 --> 18:20.256
He's the one that
really needs your help.

18:20.331 --> 18:22.196
Your surf ski lessons are scheduled
for right after breakfast.

18:22.266 --> 18:23.426
I'll be back.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.764
What about the telephone?
Have a flapjack.

18:26.870 --> 18:30.431
I've always thought that a certain
amount of guilt can be a healthy thing.

18:30.507 --> 18:32.566
Sometimes it can give us
a reason to do things

18:32.643 --> 18:34.611
that we've told everyone
we didn't want to do.

18:34.745 --> 18:35.939
Even if maybe we did.

18:36.013 --> 18:37.378
I'm looking for Donald Burns.

18:40.184 --> 18:42.152
And thanks to an address
Lally had given me,

18:42.219 --> 18:44.517
I knew I had a shot at
checking up on Donald Burns

18:44.588 --> 18:46.385
before I went back to see Lydia.

18:46.890 --> 18:47.890
Donald Burns?

19:01.105 --> 19:02.231
Donald Burns?

19:02.606 --> 19:03.630
Yeah.

19:04.141 --> 19:05.938
I was given your name
by a client.

19:08.012 --> 19:09.012
Oh, yeah?

19:11.115 --> 19:12.241
All right.

19:14.485 --> 19:16.043
Sorry about this,
how're you doing?

19:16.120 --> 19:17.451
Thomas Magnum. Hi.

19:18.489 --> 19:19.979
So a client recommended me, huh?

19:20.090 --> 19:21.955
Well, actually,
the client is mine.

19:22.826 --> 19:24.088
Lydia McCarthy.

19:32.202 --> 19:33.567
Private detective, huh?

19:33.704 --> 19:35.171
Private investigator.

19:38.375 --> 19:39.740
How is she?

19:41.412 --> 19:43.573
Well, why don't you come
see for yourself?

19:45.382 --> 19:48.476
No. No, I don't think that
would be a good idea.

19:50.087 --> 19:52.715
She's gonna have
to get over this.

19:53.157 --> 19:55.157
I don't think it'd be helpful
if I agreed to see her

19:55.192 --> 19:56.750
every time she came
running after me.

19:57.861 --> 20:02.230
Well, I think she'd be willing to leave
you alone if you gave her back her son.

20:06.937 --> 20:07.937
Lydia.

20:17.848 --> 20:20.976
When I went to work
for the McCarthys,

20:22.453 --> 20:25.479
Lydia was a very pretty,

20:26.190 --> 20:29.216
very unhappy 17-year-old girl.

20:29.460 --> 20:31.894
She was desperate for attention.

20:31.995 --> 20:33.257
For love.

20:34.531 --> 20:38.399
I knew I wasn't the guy who was
gonna make her happy. I'm a driver.

20:38.469 --> 20:40.767
I like my job.
I make a good living, but...

20:42.406 --> 20:46.604
I don't think I would exactly
fit into that social circle.

20:47.911 --> 20:49.708
Besides, I'm 15 years
older than her.

20:50.414 --> 20:54.373
I tried to tell her she would
find somebody someday.

20:55.919 --> 20:58.581
She took it as rejection,
tried to get back at me.

21:00.624 --> 21:02.751
Convinced her father

21:03.494 --> 21:05.621
that I had had my way with her.

21:07.431 --> 21:08.898
He dismissed me.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.162
I moved as far away as I could.

21:12.903 --> 21:14.302
She keeps coming after me.

21:14.772 --> 21:16.933
When she's not tracking
me down, the gossip is.

21:17.207 --> 21:19.038
Do you know how difficult
it is to keep a job

21:19.109 --> 21:21.942
with the long arm of
old man McCarthy reaching out?

21:28.786 --> 21:30.185
There's no baby.

21:32.256 --> 21:34.019
Just a lonely girl's fantasy.

21:38.162 --> 21:41.097
I'm afraid I can't tell you
the nature of the case.

21:41.431 --> 21:44.832
You'll be well compensated. You
don't need to know the details.

21:51.441 --> 21:55.138
I think anybody you hire is going to
want to know what he's looking for.

21:56.313 --> 21:57.507
Professional ethics.

21:57.981 --> 21:59.346
How did you get in here?

22:01.985 --> 22:03.282
Professional secret.

22:05.756 --> 22:07.690
You changed your mind
about the money.

22:08.525 --> 22:10.152
Yeah. Yeah.

22:11.628 --> 22:12.686
I figure

22:12.896 --> 22:15.364
that I'll take you
back on for...

22:15.432 --> 22:16.432
Oh,

22:16.500 --> 22:17.728
three thousand.

22:19.436 --> 22:20.436
Cash.

22:21.338 --> 22:23.329
$3,000, cash.

22:26.109 --> 22:27.440
I...

22:29.213 --> 22:33.274
I don't... I can get
you $3,000, but...

22:33.383 --> 22:35.510
Why don't you tell me
what's really going on?

22:39.223 --> 22:40.918
I didn't think
I'd see you again.

22:41.158 --> 22:42.455
Neither did I.

22:46.129 --> 22:47.619
Why did you come back?

22:49.600 --> 22:50.862
Well...

22:52.002 --> 22:53.367
All of a sudden,

22:55.138 --> 22:57.003
I got this really strange idea.

22:57.107 --> 23:01.237
I got this idea that you
don't have any money at all.

23:03.447 --> 23:04.675
I'm Lydia McCarthy.

23:05.048 --> 23:06.845
Oh, I know. I know.
I didn't mean

23:07.784 --> 23:09.684
that your family
doesn't have money.

23:10.487 --> 23:13.888
But I figured, maybe,
for some reason...

23:14.725 --> 23:17.455
Like maybe your family
doesn't want you doing this?

23:17.928 --> 23:19.327
Looking for your boy?

23:20.330 --> 23:22.958
And that you didn't have
any money right now,

23:23.600 --> 23:27.001
and that you were almost out of
cash and you were doing your best,

23:27.204 --> 23:31.868
trying really hard, to hold it
together and not ask for help.

23:32.142 --> 23:33.609
Not really ask for help.

23:34.778 --> 23:35.778
Is this close?

23:37.648 --> 23:38.672
Maybe.

23:40.784 --> 23:41.784
So,

23:42.853 --> 23:45.014
I thought to myself,

23:45.088 --> 23:48.649
"What kind of person would
do something like this?"

23:48.725 --> 23:50.192
And I came up
with two possibilities.

23:50.260 --> 23:52.922
Either somebody who
was a little bit crazy

23:53.664 --> 23:55.529
and was making
the whole thing up...

23:57.868 --> 23:58.868
Or?

24:03.707 --> 24:04.765
Or,

24:08.445 --> 24:10.174
somebody who was
very courageous.

24:12.916 --> 24:15.180
"Courageous" is Father Damien,

24:16.420 --> 24:18.980
or Rocky Balboa.
I just want to find my son.

24:20.424 --> 24:22.358
Why don't we go
talk to Donald Burns?

24:30.968 --> 24:32.833
Why didn't you tell me
that you'd seen him?

24:32.903 --> 24:34.983
I had to make sure you didn't
make the whole thing up.

24:35.772 --> 24:38.502
You did lie to me
a couple of times.

24:38.709 --> 24:40.176
Meanwhile, you let him get away.

24:40.243 --> 24:41.403
I did not let him get away.

24:41.478 --> 24:43.002
They said he went home sick.

24:45.248 --> 24:46.681
Well, it's possible.

24:46.817 --> 24:48.512
Lot of flu going around.

24:49.152 --> 24:50.710
At least you got his address.

24:50.787 --> 24:52.186
Maybe he's around back.

24:58.495 --> 24:59.792
He's still here.

25:18.048 --> 25:19.675
Mr. Magnum! Look!

25:24.454 --> 25:25.887
His favorite toy.

25:26.256 --> 25:28.554
Lydia, a lot of kids
have teddy bears.

25:29.026 --> 25:30.357
Bloomingdale's.

25:41.004 --> 25:42.972
There's only one of these.

25:44.975 --> 25:46.340
We've found him.

25:57.305 --> 25:59.739
How long do these
stakeouts usually take?

25:59.971 --> 26:00.971
Oh...

26:01.472 --> 26:03.201
He's gotta come home sometime.

26:05.977 --> 26:08.070
Jesse loves rainbows.

26:09.680 --> 26:12.240
Of course, there aren't too
many of them in New York,

26:13.117 --> 26:16.450
but one day after a summer storm,
there was a giant rainbow.

26:16.654 --> 26:19.817
Jesse said he had to have one
just like it for his very own.

26:20.791 --> 26:23.851
He kept saying,
"Mommy, find me a rainbow!"

26:24.629 --> 26:26.119
"Find me a rainbow."

26:28.299 --> 26:30.494
So I went out
and bought him one.

26:34.505 --> 26:36.564
Yeah, I kind of like
rainbows, too.

26:41.145 --> 26:42.442
Are you hungry?

26:45.549 --> 26:47.744
"Heavenly Meadows Nature Bar."

26:48.686 --> 26:50.119
I really hate granola.

26:50.554 --> 26:52.852
You don't have any chocolate
chip cookies in there, do you?

26:52.923 --> 26:53.923
No.

26:54.191 --> 26:56.591
Rolled oats, soy beans...

26:57.194 --> 27:00.061
I guess granola
is an acquired taste.

27:03.401 --> 27:04.925
The yard looks quite nice.

27:07.104 --> 27:08.833
I'll bet the house
is clean, too.

27:10.074 --> 27:13.840
Well, I'd hold off on giving Donald
the Good Housekeeping Award.

27:14.278 --> 27:15.404
Lydia,

27:19.216 --> 27:22.344
there is some evidence to
indicate that there might be

27:23.154 --> 27:24.849
a lady of the house.

27:26.123 --> 27:27.420
Why didn't you tell me?

27:29.460 --> 27:32.054
Well, the evidence
was pink and frilly,

27:32.129 --> 27:34.461
and it just didn't
seem important at the time.

27:35.166 --> 27:38.101
Did you think I'd be jealous that
Donald has a new girlfriend?

27:38.202 --> 27:39.226
No.

27:40.638 --> 27:43.607
But I thought you might be jealous
if Jesse had a new mother.

27:59.390 --> 28:00.390
Jesse.

28:10.634 --> 28:12.101
Excuse me.

28:12.603 --> 28:14.798
My name's Thomas Magnum. Can
I talk to you for a minute?

28:14.872 --> 28:16.339
What's going on here? Lydia!

28:18.109 --> 28:19.736
What do you think you're doing?

28:23.614 --> 28:24.614
Jesse?

28:24.715 --> 28:25.807
Ben!

28:25.916 --> 28:27.315
Mommy! Mommy!

28:30.187 --> 28:31.381
You okay?

28:34.658 --> 28:35.989
I'm sorry.

28:37.561 --> 28:39.256
I thought he was my son.

28:48.506 --> 28:49.666
Thank you.

28:54.845 --> 28:59.111
I can't talk very long. I've got to put the
groceries away and finish making supper.

28:59.617 --> 29:01.380
Well, we're not gonna
take up much of your time.

29:01.452 --> 29:03.079
Do you have any idea
where Donald went?

29:04.255 --> 29:08.089
Well, he's usually at work. If they
said he was sick... I don't know.

29:12.663 --> 29:16.224
Did Donald ever talk
to you about his son?

29:18.302 --> 29:20.361
I really think you'd
better be going now.

29:20.571 --> 29:23.404
I'm not leaving until I find out
what's happened to Jesse. Lydia.

29:25.109 --> 29:27.339
Donald has been really
good to me and my son.

29:27.411 --> 29:30.403
And I'm not about to let you come
in here and start making trouble.

29:30.581 --> 29:31.809
Where is Jesse?

29:32.149 --> 29:33.548
He's not here!

29:33.984 --> 29:37.249
I can't tell you any more than that.
Now would you just please leave?

29:37.321 --> 29:39.619
Georgia, if you know something
you have to tell us.

29:39.690 --> 29:40.714
I don't!

29:40.825 --> 29:42.122
Please, tell me!

29:42.193 --> 29:43.820
All right! He's dead!

29:49.066 --> 29:50.192
I'm sorry.

29:51.268 --> 29:53.168
Donald told me he died.

30:00.044 --> 30:02.410
Don't worry. You'll still get paid.
Lydia.

30:02.513 --> 30:04.071
Just send me a bill
and I'll send you your money.

30:04.148 --> 30:06.582
I don't care about the money. But don't
think because you're off the case

30:06.650 --> 30:08.641
that I'm going to quit looking.
Who said I'm off the case?

30:08.719 --> 30:10.380
You can believe her
if you want to.

30:10.454 --> 30:13.150
But I don't believe that my son
is dead, not for one second.

30:13.457 --> 30:15.687
Because if my son were
dead, I would know it.

30:16.193 --> 30:18.252
If my son were dead,
I would feel it.

30:25.536 --> 30:26.730
Oh, God.

30:32.243 --> 30:33.904
What if she's right?

30:46.957 --> 30:48.015
Now look,

30:49.226 --> 30:52.423
Donald lied to you,
he lied to me,

30:53.464 --> 30:54.795
and probably lied to her.

30:55.432 --> 30:57.024
And I think we should find out.

31:02.406 --> 31:04.203
But it's not going to be easy.

31:04.275 --> 31:06.072
You think you're up to it?

31:08.479 --> 31:09.741
I don't know.

31:10.814 --> 31:12.338
I think you are.

31:24.461 --> 31:29.592
Kanaloa, lord of the
ocean and ocean winds,

31:29.900 --> 31:31.891
most commonly took the form

31:32.670 --> 31:34.297
of octopus and squid.

31:38.275 --> 31:40.334
And from time to time,

31:41.178 --> 31:42.873
took the form of the banana.

31:54.058 --> 31:55.320
Man, this is great.

31:55.392 --> 31:57.986
Wish I had a camp like this in my
neighborhood when I was growing up.

31:58.062 --> 32:00.530
Yeah, you could've use a
Lally Zachary in your life.

32:00.898 --> 32:03.833
Oh, it's all a lot
of flash and show.

32:03.901 --> 32:05.869
Round up a bunch of
scruffy adolescents,

32:05.936 --> 32:07.426
declare them underprivileged,

32:07.504 --> 32:09.734
and we all just
fall all over ourselves

32:09.807 --> 32:12.298
trying to make life
okay for them.

32:12.376 --> 32:15.038
Methinks the lady
doth protest too much.

32:15.112 --> 32:16.238
Oh, please.

32:16.447 --> 32:18.506
Hey, you got any kids
of your own?

32:22.386 --> 32:23.614
Camp Kauhale.

32:23.954 --> 32:26.354
Yeah. She's here. Hold on.

32:26.623 --> 32:27.681
It's your office.

32:28.859 --> 32:30.087
Yes?

32:30.160 --> 32:31.160
How do I look?

32:31.261 --> 32:32.261
Uh-huh.

32:32.663 --> 32:35.860
Calvin Klein
ain't losing no sleep.

32:37.468 --> 32:38.628
I'll be right there.

32:39.937 --> 32:42.269
Hey, you'll be back in time
for the luau, won't you?

32:42.339 --> 32:43.738
You bet. I sure will.

32:47.378 --> 32:50.779
And with him
died the old Hawaii.

32:51.482 --> 32:54.280
Ruled by Ku, Kane,

32:54.551 --> 32:57.349
Lono, and Kanaloa.

33:01.525 --> 33:05.359
At the same time, of course,
many practices ended,

33:06.463 --> 33:08.897
including human sacrifice.

33:21.578 --> 33:24.103
Though there are arguments
for its reinstatement.

33:26.583 --> 33:29.711
Looking at photos of
deceased kids is tough duty.

33:31.755 --> 33:33.552
It takes a special kind of guts.

33:34.058 --> 33:35.821
She's just a kid herself.

33:56.180 --> 33:59.411
Well, that's all the files we
have from the coroner's office.

33:59.950 --> 34:01.212
Where do we go from here?

34:01.385 --> 34:03.717
My guess is, if the kid's
not with your husband,

34:03.821 --> 34:07.257
there's a good chance...
He's not my husband.

34:10.027 --> 34:11.654
If he's not with
the boy's father,

34:12.196 --> 34:14.494
there's a good chance that
he's been put up for adoption.

34:14.697 --> 34:17.531
What kind of an agency would
take him without my consent?

34:17.734 --> 34:21.261
Well, this Burns may not have been entirely
honest about the status of the mother.

34:21.438 --> 34:23.303
Or maybe he didn't
go through an agency.

34:23.574 --> 34:25.667
I'd say that's a more
likely scenario.

34:26.310 --> 34:30.007
There are two or three law firms
in town that deal with these

34:30.614 --> 34:32.138
difficult adoptions.

34:33.083 --> 34:34.414
You mean illegal.

34:35.252 --> 34:36.514
Not exactly.

34:37.221 --> 34:38.518
Well, what, exactly?

34:40.056 --> 34:41.786
Well, say a couple wants a baby.

34:42.092 --> 34:43.956
Can't get one
through the agencies.

34:44.460 --> 34:46.190
This attorney knows of a baby,

34:46.830 --> 34:50.094
so the couple pays 10, $15,000.

34:50.199 --> 34:52.134
Medical expenses.
You understand?

34:52.703 --> 34:54.226
Attorney's fees.

34:56.005 --> 34:57.234
Fifteen thousand dollars.

34:57.341 --> 35:01.141
That's not medical expenses or
legal fees, that's buying babies.

35:01.211 --> 35:03.839
Can you give me any
of these lawyers' names?

35:12.256 --> 35:15.248
We're not talking about any
crime being committed here,

35:16.894 --> 35:18.691
in the strictly legal sense.

35:18.862 --> 35:22.229
Well, Lydia never agreed to put her
baby up for adoption. Not at any price.

35:27.237 --> 35:28.636
Did you find something?

35:30.140 --> 35:31.368
I think so.

35:34.511 --> 35:37.002
It's just not a good idea for
you to come to this office.

35:37.080 --> 35:39.048
I told you that.

35:39.883 --> 35:42.579
This exchange was supposed
to take place on Tuesday.

35:42.753 --> 35:45.916
Yeah, well, something
came up and I can't wait.

35:47.024 --> 35:50.152
You know if anyone connects me
with you, I could be disbarred.

35:52.796 --> 35:54.476
All right, you'll get
the rest of the money

35:54.531 --> 35:56.726
when you drop the child off
at the center.

35:59.336 --> 36:00.633
Thank you.

36:03.407 --> 36:04.601
I...

36:05.576 --> 36:09.376
I also think it's a good idea if we
terminate our professional relationship.

36:10.113 --> 36:11.341
Don't worry.

36:12.082 --> 36:14.676
I'm taking the next
stage coach out of town.

36:28.146 --> 36:29.875
Come on. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

36:31.582 --> 36:35.279
You see, Jonny?
Everything's going just fine.

36:36.888 --> 36:38.446
At least for the moment.

36:40.391 --> 36:43.121
The boys will all be
returning to their own homes

36:44.128 --> 36:46.062
in approximately 120 hours.

36:47.298 --> 36:50.995
Jonny, you're not
gonna believe this.

36:51.102 --> 36:52.262
What?

36:53.204 --> 36:54.899
Camp Kauhale...

36:55.239 --> 36:56.239
Yes?

36:58.276 --> 37:02.440
We've raised enough money to do
this all over again next year!

37:02.747 --> 37:04.009
No.

37:05.883 --> 37:07.077
No!

37:07.718 --> 37:08.980
Camp Kauhale.

37:09.754 --> 37:11.551
Yes, Mr. Magnum.
He's right here.

37:12.056 --> 37:13.421
Magnum, where are you?

37:13.524 --> 37:15.287
You promise to teach the
boys how to surf ski

37:15.359 --> 37:16.587
and then you simply disappear.

37:16.661 --> 37:18.959
Have you no sense of
obligation, or responsibility?

37:19.030 --> 37:21.362
Higgins, I'm sorry.
Something came up.

37:21.499 --> 37:23.899
What could be so important that
you would break your word?

37:23.968 --> 37:25.595
I don't have time
to explain right now.

37:25.670 --> 37:27.262
I need to talk to Susan Brandes.

37:27.605 --> 37:29.903
Luckily for her, she's not here.

37:29.974 --> 37:31.134
Do you know where she went?

37:31.209 --> 37:33.507
No. But someone else called.
She said it was urgent.

37:33.611 --> 37:35.135
She said her name was Georgia

37:35.213 --> 37:37.477
and that you would know
what it was all about.

37:39.883 --> 37:42.579
I should have never
told him you were here.

37:44.755 --> 37:46.052
He got real mad.

37:47.891 --> 37:49.188
He took Ben away.

37:50.961 --> 37:52.292
Your son? Yeah.

37:53.130 --> 37:56.725
He once told me that if I ever
did anything to cross him,

37:56.934 --> 37:58.663
he'd take away
everything I loved.

38:00.037 --> 38:01.470
Where would he go?

38:02.239 --> 38:05.333
Georgia, if you know something,

38:06.110 --> 38:07.475
Mr. Magnum can help you.

38:07.544 --> 38:08.772
But he can't find your son

38:08.846 --> 38:10.473
unless you tell him the truth.

38:14.385 --> 38:18.549
Well, I don't know if this means
anything, but a couple of weeks ago,

38:18.889 --> 38:21.585
I found this telephone number
in his pants pocket.

38:21.792 --> 38:24.192
I called it. A lady answered.

38:24.928 --> 38:27.055
I figured he was
seeing another woman.

38:27.731 --> 38:29.289
I don't even know why I kept it.

38:30.234 --> 38:32.998
I thought if he ever left me
I'd know where to get him.

38:33.704 --> 38:35.763
I don't think
she's a girlfriend.

38:40.110 --> 38:42.101
Susan Brandes. May I help you?

38:43.847 --> 38:45.712
Hello? Who is this?

38:49.620 --> 38:51.281
All the way back to Waikiki,

38:51.355 --> 38:55.621
I kept telling myself we were going
to find the end of the rainbow.

38:55.693 --> 38:58.594
That no matter what Mr. Corkill
had said in ninth-grade science,

38:58.729 --> 39:00.697
there was a pot of gold
at the end.

39:00.964 --> 39:03.023
And right now
its name was Jesse.

39:03.500 --> 39:06.958
And that this time, the rainbow
wouldn't vanish into air and mist

39:07.037 --> 39:08.937
as soon as we got close.

39:12.142 --> 39:14.133
That's what I kept
telling myself.

39:14.812 --> 39:18.077
Even though I knew the chances of
that happening were pretty remote.

39:22.753 --> 39:25.347
There was no question
in my mind that Donald Burns

39:25.422 --> 39:28.084
had recently taken Georgia's
son to Susan Brandes,

39:28.192 --> 39:30.524
just as he had taken Jesse
to her some time ago.

39:30.594 --> 39:33.961
But I had no way of knowing what had
happened to the boys from there.

39:34.131 --> 39:36.895
And no way of protecting Lydia
from what I might learn

39:36.967 --> 39:38.059
if it was bad.

39:38.202 --> 39:40.670
Beautiful Saturday,
and here you are, working?

39:42.873 --> 39:44.238
I don't mind working hard.

39:44.308 --> 39:45.673
It's the only way to get ahead.

39:45.743 --> 39:47.335
What are you doing here?

39:48.245 --> 39:50.543
I could have sworn
I locked that door.

39:51.815 --> 39:54.010
I believe we have
a mutual client.

39:54.585 --> 39:55.984
Donald Burns.

39:58.021 --> 40:00.922
You probably met him
through Loretta Vanderpost.

40:02.126 --> 40:03.787
You know, if this is
a business call,

40:03.861 --> 40:05.624
I'm afraid you're gonna have
to make an appointment.

40:05.696 --> 40:08.859
Oh, I'm sure you can make some
time for a friend of Lally's.

40:09.199 --> 40:12.862
I mean, she set you up
in your law firm here,

40:12.936 --> 40:14.456
sent you one or two
influential clients

40:14.471 --> 40:16.598
to kind of get the
practice off the ground.

40:17.007 --> 40:18.440
And what if she did?

40:19.109 --> 40:21.009
Well, I just figured
that once she found out

40:21.078 --> 40:23.512
you're dealing in the
black-market baby business...

40:23.781 --> 40:26.909
That sounds remarkably
like blackmail, Mr. Magnum.

40:27.851 --> 40:30.149
Blackmail's such
an ugly concept.

40:31.155 --> 40:32.679
Like selling babies.

40:34.258 --> 40:36.283
If you had anything,
you'd go to the police.

40:36.360 --> 40:37.884
Only as a last resort.

40:38.195 --> 40:40.163
Well, what do you want?
Donald Burns.

40:40.230 --> 40:42.027
Well, I can't give him to you.

40:42.332 --> 40:44.232
Well, then I guess
I got no other choice.

40:44.334 --> 40:45.892
Oh, you've got it
all figured out, don't you?

40:45.969 --> 40:48.233
The world is so
black and white to you?

40:48.338 --> 40:49.862
Some things are.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.133
Well, it's not so simple.

40:53.510 --> 40:55.910
Let me tell you a story,
Mr. Magnum.

40:56.613 --> 40:59.946
It's about a 16-year-old girl
who got herself into trouble.

41:00.384 --> 41:02.944
This is a girl from a
big family, no money,

41:03.086 --> 41:06.283
no chance of keeping the baby and
giving it any kind of a decent life.

41:06.790 --> 41:08.121
So she found a lawyer.

41:08.492 --> 41:10.426
A guy who knew of
a very wealthy couple

41:10.494 --> 41:12.985
who desperately wanted
their own baby girl.

41:13.764 --> 41:17.063
The couple paid all of her medical
expenses plus a little more,

41:17.734 --> 41:19.964
a little gift

41:20.804 --> 41:22.738
for carrying the baby

41:23.106 --> 41:25.666
and taking good care of it
till it could be adopted.

41:27.678 --> 41:31.774
Now I ask you,
who's so hurt by this?

41:32.282 --> 41:35.080
The baby, who has a
chance at a decent life?

41:35.419 --> 41:38.547
The couple, who finally has the family
that they've always longed for?

41:38.622 --> 41:41.921
The girl, who has an opportunity
to make something of her life

41:41.992 --> 41:43.482
before she has children?

41:44.161 --> 41:45.651
You left one thing out.

41:47.231 --> 41:48.596
You made that choice.

41:48.799 --> 41:50.096
They all do.

41:50.601 --> 41:53.331
I mean, they may carry on a
bit, pull out all the dramatics

41:53.403 --> 41:56.895
to convince everybody, mostly themselves,
that they don't have a choice,

41:56.974 --> 41:58.066
but they do,

41:58.141 --> 42:00.006
and they've made that choice.

42:00.210 --> 42:01.734
I didn't.

42:06.416 --> 42:09.146
I'm sorry about the other
people who want him.

42:09.520 --> 42:10.987
But he's my son.

42:11.755 --> 42:13.484
I'm not giving him up.

42:26.236 --> 42:30.764
Do you have any idea what
this means to my career?

42:31.708 --> 42:32.936
To my life?

42:38.649 --> 42:42.085
1567, Puuhonua Road.

42:42.753 --> 42:45.085
There's a holding house there.

42:47.357 --> 42:49.450
Mr. Magnum, I...

42:52.062 --> 42:54.656
I only did what I thought
was best for everybody.

43:26.396 --> 43:27.590
What if...

43:27.998 --> 43:29.898
What if he doesn't remember me?

43:30.701 --> 43:31.701
Hey,

43:32.603 --> 43:34.571
you'd be surprised
what kids remember.

43:45.749 --> 43:47.717
It's Ben.

43:52.889 --> 43:54.322
Hi, Ben. Hi.

43:54.391 --> 43:56.222
You having fun on the swing?
Yes.

44:11.141 --> 44:13.166
It's okay. It's okay.
Enough. Enough.

44:41.638 --> 44:42.832
Where are we going?

44:42.906 --> 44:44.533
We're going home, okay?

44:50.814 --> 44:52.748
Donald, where is Jesse?

44:53.950 --> 44:55.417
It's too late, Lydia.

44:56.319 --> 44:57.650
He's not here.

44:58.822 --> 45:00.346
They already took him away.

45:15.639 --> 45:16.799
Jesse!

45:18.008 --> 45:19.168
Jesse!

46:02.385 --> 46:05.877
For the first time since the day
I sat in ninth-grade science,

46:06.323 --> 46:08.791
I began to consider
that Mr. Corkill was right,

46:08.892 --> 46:12.521
that rainbows may be nothing
more than optical illusions.

47:01.878 --> 47:02.970
Jesse.

47:03.647 --> 47:05.239
Hi, Mommy.

47:08.852 --> 47:11.116
But if rainbows
are optical illusions,

47:11.388 --> 47:13.879
in order to see them you have
to have the sun at your back

47:13.957 --> 47:15.481
and the rain in front of you.

47:15.625 --> 47:17.752
The rain was all
behind Lydia now,

47:17.828 --> 47:20.353
and she could be content
with something even better.

47:20.564 --> 47:22.964
Holding on to a little
rainbow of her very own.
