your technique is all wrong.

to be a coach or to be around kids at all.

she's giving me my big break.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.732
Oh!
That's how we gotta scream!

10:07.816 --> 10:09.150
But it's hideous.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.401
Exactly.

10:10.485 --> 10:13.113
Come on, guys.
As hideous as you can.

10:13.196 --> 10:15.240
[screaming]

10:22.622 --> 10:23.540
[whimpering]

10:23.623 --> 10:24.623
[sigh]

10:25.083 --> 10:27.752
Mom, I'm sorry...
for everything.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.046
I don't know what
happened to me.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.881
Actually, I do.
It was Meep.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.341
I shouldn't have listened to Meep.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.009
Yes, it was Meep.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.219
But it's okay.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.513
You did turn out to be a good screamer.

10:38.596 --> 10:41.558
Of course, you are still crazy grounded.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.601
Meep, you're cut.

10:43.685 --> 10:46.187
- Seriously. You're obviously fired.
- Yeah!

10:46.271 --> 10:48.648
I got some pizzazz fingers
for you right here.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.609
Hmph!
You don't deserve me anyway.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.653
[neck cracking]
Oh! Oh, my neck.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.446
Oh, no, I'm stuck this way.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.031
So, who's gonna replace her?

10:57.115 --> 10:59.284
[screeching]

10:59.367 --> 11:03.746
Teacher Squawk?
You're okay-slash-gross.

11:03.830 --> 11:07.083
I shall resume coaching the team.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.461
I know the horrors of
an albatroceros' stomach firsthand,

11:10.545 --> 11:14.465
and now truly understand how to scream.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.468
Well, that worked out.

11:17.552 --> 11:21.139
We didn't die,
so I guess everything's all tied up.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.724
Oh, wait, Thunk.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.559
[shouts, grunts]

11:24.642 --> 11:27.270
Thunk, are you okay?

11:27.353 --> 11:29.314
Ha! You spoke.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.523
I win.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.318
Son, you really couldn't
climb out of this?

11:34.360 --> 11:36.321
[music playing]

11:43.119 --> 11:45.288
[screaming]

11:46.706 --> 11:48.082
[screaming continues]

11:49.208 --> 11:51.586
Hey, neighbors, scream once for help,

11:51.669 --> 11:54.088
scream twice if we can go home
and finish dinner.

11:54.172 --> 11:55.465
[screams]

11:56.174 --> 11:58.414
Give it time, Ugga.
There could still be a second scream.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.179
No. No, Grug,
Meep sounds really...

12:01.262 --> 12:03.431
okay.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.433
You're okay.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.060
I could've sworn I heard...

12:07.143 --> 12:08.519
[screaming]

12:08.603 --> 12:10.688
Oh, you did.

12:10.772 --> 12:13.232
[screaming]
Oh, gosh!

12:17.153 --> 12:20.406
A jackrobat flew in
and Snoot's got himself in a tizzy.

12:20.490 --> 12:23.076
I told you this thing is out for blood.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.494
Look at those teeth.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.703
[squeaking]

12:26.955 --> 12:29.165
[sighs]
I got this.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.627
When it comes to prey,
Snoot's worth...

12:32.710 --> 12:34.629
well, I don't wanna say "nothing."

12:34.712 --> 12:36.631
Uh, how 'bout "less"?

12:36.714 --> 12:38.841
Oh, he's worthless, all right.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.009
Worthless?

12:40.093 --> 12:43.429
I'm the smartest caveman
in Ahhh! Valley.

12:43.513 --> 12:44.931
I know everything.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.975
Like, well, oh!

12:47.058 --> 12:50.061
Did you know redberries
are poisonous?

12:53.189 --> 12:56.943
Just once, I'd like you
to kill a jackrobat for me.

12:57.026 --> 13:00.446
Well, if I hadn't screamed so loudly,
Grug never would've shown up.

13:00.530 --> 13:03.366
So, in a way,
I was the one who killed it.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.577
Oh, yes, I'm so lucky
you're such a coward.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.579
Darn right.
Oh.

13:09.372 --> 13:12.500
Well, it looks like things
are good here now, so we'll just...

13:12.583 --> 13:14.043
- Yeah...
- We'll just be, uh...

13:14.127 --> 13:16.087
- Bye.
- Bye, guys!

13:16.170 --> 13:17.046
[chuckling]

13:17.130 --> 13:20.633
Grug, you shouldn't take joy
in the misfortunes of others.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.719
I'm not... much.

13:22.802 --> 13:27.348
It's just that, for once, the Boors have
it bad, and the Croods are problem-free.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.808
Well, I'm moving in.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.810
But we were problem-free!

13:30.893 --> 13:34.647
Meep has this crazy idea
that I haven't been pulling my weight

13:34.731 --> 13:37.025
as a husband in a very long time.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.401
Maybe ever.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.361
So she doesn't wanna see me again.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.572
Maybe ever.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.658
Oh, Snoot, I am so sorry.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.910
Oh, don't feel bad for Meep.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.038
She'll come to her senses
and beg me back.

13:50.121 --> 13:56.127
And until then, I get some
long-overdue Snoot time and so do you.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.838
No, no, no!
I have had enough Snoot time.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.174
Grug, he doesn't have
anywhere to go.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.801
If we kick him out,
he'll get eaten by a predator

14:03.885 --> 14:06.345
or die from a slight change
in temperature.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.806
- [sniffles]
- You're right.

14:08.890 --> 14:11.142
Fine.
He can stay the night.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.936
- One night.
- Excellent!

14:14.020 --> 14:15.980
Though, you know,

14:16.064 --> 14:20.193
it is common courtesy
to clean your cave when you have a guest.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.904
Oh.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.906
This probably is clean...

14:26.032 --> 14:27.533
for a family as filthy as yours.

14:27.617 --> 14:28.701
[growls]

14:28.785 --> 14:30.870

14:39.253 --> 14:42.090
You guys are too firm!

14:42.173 --> 14:44.217
[grunting]

14:44.300 --> 14:46.344
[sighs]

14:46.427 --> 14:48.137
[groaning]

14:48.221 --> 14:49.347
Good night.

14:49.430 --> 14:53.476
Though I should warn you,
I'm a sleep yeller.

14:53.559 --> 14:57.063
[screaming]
No, no, no, no, stop!

14:57.146 --> 15:00.483
Yes, I thought that tastes so good!

15:00.566 --> 15:01.401
[muttering]
Oh, yummy!

15:01.484 --> 15:03.111
Nom, nom!
Yummy, yummy!

15:04.487 --> 15:07.115
[wailing]

15:11.452 --> 15:14.247
Things can't go on like this.
You guys are with me, right?

15:15.373 --> 15:16.666
Well, I'm conflicted.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.293
On one hand,
I like seeing you suffer.

15:19.377 --> 15:22.505
But I also wanna see
Snoot get crushed by a boulder.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.006
Can we do both?

15:24.090 --> 15:29.345
Let's just eat breakfast, okay?

15:30.179 --> 15:31.806
[grunts]
Excuse me.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.516
[groans]

15:33.599 --> 15:35.768
Meep cuts the skin off for me.

15:35.852 --> 15:37.061
You're a grown man.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.939
Snoot, you can eat the skin.

15:41.399 --> 15:43.234
[groans]

15:43.317 --> 15:44.444
Does yours taste better?

15:44.527 --> 15:46.863
[groans]
No!

15:47.697 --> 15:49.365
- Gross.
- [groans]

15:50.450 --> 15:51.534
Oh, terrible.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.996
Also terrible.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.747
Most terrible.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.959
[groans]
What else you got?

16:00.042 --> 16:02.044
That was all of our food.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.380
Then I guess you better get more.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.715
[all groan]

16:05.798 --> 16:06.883
[whimpers]

16:06.966 --> 16:09.260
[shouts, grunts]

16:09.343 --> 16:10.678
I never...

16:10.761 --> 16:12.889
since yesterday.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.224
This is no way to treat a guest.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.934
You are not a guest.

16:17.018 --> 16:19.395
You're a pest.
In fact, I'm throwing you again.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.564
[groans] Don't bother.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.191
I'll throw myself.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.859
Meep was right.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.403
[sniffling]
I am worthless.

16:27.487 --> 16:31.365
I tried so hard to fit in here
and I failed.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.743
This was you trying to fit in?

16:33.826 --> 16:34.702
[sighs]

16:34.785 --> 16:38.414
I'll just go to Old People Island
and wait to die.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.375
[cawing]

16:41.459 --> 16:43.753
You'll be missed.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.881
That should've been you.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.175
Until they kick me out too.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.635
Snoot, wait.

16:50.718 --> 16:54.722
Old People Island
is that way, actually.

16:54.805 --> 16:57.141
[sobbing]

16:57.225 --> 16:59.685
Wait, wait.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.270
Okay.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.563
I can stay?

17:02.647 --> 17:03.773
No!

17:03.856 --> 17:07.984
But I will help you
get back together with Meep.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.319
You will?

17:09.403 --> 17:11.405
Thank you, Grug.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.866
Just come get me when it's all better.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.826
She wants someone
who can hunt, right?

17:15.910 --> 17:17.494
I can teach you to do that.

17:17.578 --> 17:18.871
How hard could it be?

17:21.165 --> 17:22.415
[gasps]

17:22.500 --> 17:25.211
Okay, so you will never be a hunter,

17:25.294 --> 17:28.256
but there's gotta be another way
for you to win Meep back.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.424
Amber know what women want,

17:30.508 --> 17:32.260
Bow-Chick-A-Wow-Wow.

17:32.343 --> 17:34.345
Someone say my name?

17:35.429 --> 17:39.934
Hey, Bow-Chick-A-Wow-Wow,
which way the watering hole?

17:42.562 --> 17:46.399
[chuckles] Amber know
where watering hole is.

17:46.482 --> 17:47.775
[chuckles]
Wink.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.735
No problem.
I can do that.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.992
A-ha!

17:56.075 --> 17:58.911
[sighs]
Why didn't my arm get bigger?

17:58.995 --> 18:00.871
Okay, this doesn't work either.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.748
Uh, what else do women like?

18:04.959 --> 18:07.378
How about you try romancing her?

18:07.461 --> 18:09.547
But I did.
That one time.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.923
No. No, no, no.

18:11.007 --> 18:13.551
You need to keep romancing her.

18:13.634 --> 18:17.930
Yes, romance is all about giving women
things they don't need to survive

18:18.014 --> 18:19.473
but want anyway.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.269
Like a big clump of my body hair.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.687
Exactly.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.274
I think we should get her something
even more romantic than that.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.191
[chuckles]

18:29.275 --> 18:31.902
There's something more romantic
than body hair?

18:31.986 --> 18:34.864
See, this is the kind of insight
only a woman could provide.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.616
[knocking]

18:38.075 --> 18:40.119
Snoot, what are you doing here?

Looking for a place to hide
from your own shadow?

18:42.580 --> 18:43.580
[scoffs]
No.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.875
There's no way to outrun that guy.

18:47.585 --> 18:51.505
Here. These are
the loveliest flowers in all the Valley.

18:51.589 --> 18:54.008
But only half as lovely as you, Meep.

18:55.384 --> 18:56.802
[sniffling]

18:58.387 --> 18:59.889
How could you?

18:59.972 --> 19:02.266
You know what flowers did to my father.

19:04.060 --> 19:07.688
Oh, yes, that was insensitive of me.

- You hear that?

That's the sound of romance.

Maybe romance should be quieter.

[Meep] Can you turn that down?

19:46.769 --> 19:48.521

20:37.236 --> 20:38.612
[stammering]
Me too, dear,

20:38.696 --> 20:43.534
and that is why I present to you
this grand gesture of my love.

20:43.617 --> 20:44.827
Uh, just a quick heads up.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.180
We couldn't find any butterhummers,
but these should do the trick.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.622
[cooing]

20:50.875 --> 20:53.335
Aww!

20:53.753 --> 20:55.921
[shouting]

20:57.673 --> 21:00.468
Hey, whose side are you guys on?

21:00.551 --> 21:02.344
- I got this.
- No.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.346
No, if you hit them, they'll drop Meep.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.015
Yeah, that's what we want, right?

21:06.098 --> 21:07.433
No, she's too high up.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.477
She'll plummet to the ground and die.

21:09.560 --> 21:13.856
So, I should throw the stone.
Wait, walk me through this again.

21:13.939 --> 21:17.318
[shouting]

21:17.401 --> 21:18.402
Oh, forget it.

21:18.486 --> 21:20.696
I guess I'll save my own wife.

21:24.992 --> 21:28.162
Hey, eat me instead!

21:28.245 --> 21:30.080
I'm marinated.

21:30.164 --> 21:32.333
I come with sauce.

21:32.666 --> 21:33.751
[cooing]

21:35.127 --> 21:38.339
[shouting]

21:41.634 --> 21:43.302
[Meep] You did it, Snoot.

21:43.385 --> 21:46.514
You finally killed for me.
Oh!

21:46.597 --> 21:49.517
How did you know
those berries were poisonous?

21:49.600 --> 21:53.479
Eat a berry that's red
and you'll end up dead.

21:53.562 --> 21:54.647
Thinking!

21:54.730 --> 21:56.023
You killed it by thinking?

21:56.106 --> 21:57.858
I guess you're not worthless after all.

21:57.942 --> 22:02.279
Thankfully, I'm married
to the smartest man in Ahhh! Valley

22:02.363 --> 22:04.365
and not a rock-headed hunter like you.

22:04.448 --> 22:07.493
[chuckles]
He is rock-headed, isn't he?

22:07.576 --> 22:11.038
But he's also the best neighbor
a guy could ask for.

22:11.121 --> 22:12.748
But mostly stupid.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.793
[laughing]

22:16.126 --> 22:20.047
You know, watching Snoot and Meep
made me want a little romance, too.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.924
You thinking what I'm thinking?

22:22.007 --> 22:23.926
Mm-hmm.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.220
[Womp singing]

22:30.849 --> 22:31.725
[yawns]

22:31.809 --> 22:34.436
I'm tired.
Can I please go home now?

22:34.520 --> 22:35.520
- No.
- No.

22:35.563 --> 22:36.480
Hmm.

22:36.564 --> 22:38.983
[singing weakly]
