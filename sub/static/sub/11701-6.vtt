WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:02.740
This is good shit.

00:02.820 --> 00:04.700
I'll bloody kill whoever gave it to you.

00:05.420 --> 00:07.540
Toni, tell me who supplied you the drugs.

00:07.620 --> 00:08.700
It was the teacher.

00:08.780 --> 00:10.700
- What if it gets out?
- It won't. I'll make it go away.

00:10.780 --> 00:12.220
Now get your things and leave the prison.

00:12.900 --> 00:16.059
If you repeat that story to anyone,
you will not get out of here,

00:16.140 --> 00:19.060
and you will not see your daughter
again. Do I make myself clear?

00:19.300 --> 00:20.300
One down.

00:20.380 --> 00:22.900
Well, you know better than
to fuck with my family.

00:23.620 --> 00:25.340
The Department put this out.

00:25.700 --> 00:27.420
- I'll do it.
- Great.

00:27.700 --> 00:29.060
As long as you're my tutor.

00:30.860 --> 00:32.659
- So, what's your name?
- Debbie.

00:32.980 --> 00:35.020
I'm Brayden. Brayden Holt.

00:36.900 --> 00:39.220
I don't give a shit about your family.

00:39.300 --> 00:42.180
If you're stupid enough to keep them
in your life, that's your problem.

00:42.340 --> 00:44.220
- Coming out tonight?
- Are you going, Vera?

00:44.300 --> 00:47.460
No. Adam's taking me
out, so... It's a show...

00:47.980 --> 00:49.540
I understand you don't want to get offside

00:49.620 --> 00:51.180
with the other officers,
particularly Fletch.

00:51.380 --> 00:52.860
I need you to put your
personal feelings aside.

00:52.940 --> 00:54.100
What?

00:54.660 --> 00:57.020
But I... I don't have
personal feelings for...

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:30.660 --> 02:33.220
Lipstick can't change
what you were born with.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.220
Some girls can wear makeup,

02:36.300 --> 02:37.300
some can't.

02:37.380 --> 02:39.540
Better to know which one you are now

02:39.620 --> 02:42.140
so you don't go wasting any more
of your money on this rubbish.

03:10.140 --> 03:11.220
Hi, Vera.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.860
Oh. Hi, Hayley, um...

03:14.420 --> 03:16.500
I was thinking about today.

03:17.100 --> 03:18.220
Work.

03:18.300 --> 03:19.300
When are you not?

03:19.540 --> 03:21.740
- I like my job.
- Well, so do I, but not 24/7.

03:23.700 --> 03:26.060
Don't know, you hang
around here often enough.

03:26.140 --> 03:27.380
That's my boss.

03:27.780 --> 03:29.380
Karen's big on follow-up stories

03:29.460 --> 03:31.820
and your boss won't give me anything, so...

03:33.660 --> 03:35.820
Oh, I like what you've done.

03:36.660 --> 03:38.500
Oh, I'm just, you know,
trying something new.

03:38.980 --> 03:40.580
Yeah. Looks really good.

03:40.780 --> 03:42.860
I spend way too much time
in front of the mirror.

03:43.020 --> 03:45.020
It's all part of the job.

03:45.260 --> 03:47.220
If you like, I could make a suggestion?

03:58.900 --> 04:00.140
Morning.

04:03.900 --> 04:05.300
- Hi.
- Like the lippy.

04:05.460 --> 04:06.820
Aw, thanks!

04:08.900 --> 04:10.700
Er, Fletch, want a coffee?

04:10.780 --> 04:12.660
Oh, I'm... I'm good, thanks, Vera.

04:13.180 --> 04:15.340
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Good.

04:15.940 --> 04:17.660
Hey, volleyball looks like fun.

04:17.740 --> 04:18.779
Put your name down.

04:20.820 --> 04:23.140
- Yeah, I don't know.
- Too busy with that boyfriend of yours?

04:23.740 --> 04:25.460
- Does he ever let you out?
- Yeah, of course.

04:25.540 --> 04:26.740
Really?

04:26.860 --> 04:28.060
Yeah, you know, it's just that...

04:28.140 --> 04:31.220
You know, he's got work
dos and parties to go to.

04:31.420 --> 04:34.820
And everyone likes him
and my mum loves him and...

04:34.940 --> 04:36.580
Oh, well. If you change your mind...

04:36.940 --> 04:38.860
Attention, compound. Attention, compound.

04:38.940 --> 04:40.540
Count will commence in 10 minutes.

04:47.860 --> 04:49.900
Hi, it's me again. Can someone pick up?

04:52.260 --> 04:53.860
Uh, Mr. Fletcher?

04:55.940 --> 04:58.740
Um, so, the volleyball, what do you think?

04:59.580 --> 05:01.620
Well, I put my name down for it.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.300
Right, yeah.

05:03.380 --> 05:04.380
- Yeah.
- Right.

05:04.460 --> 05:06.580
- Um... Well, it sounds like fun.
- So you said.

05:06.780 --> 05:08.820
Vera, I've got a couple
of interviews booked

05:08.900 --> 05:11.100
for the new teacher's position.
I'd like you to be there.

05:11.180 --> 05:12.300
Ah, what time?

05:12.380 --> 05:14.820
- Just check with Mary Anne.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:18.340 --> 05:20.140
You know, I was thinking that, um...

05:20.220 --> 05:22.340
Wearing my hair back all the
time was giving me headaches.

05:23.380 --> 05:26.620
Well, I think that I'll, um,
sign up for the volleyball.

05:27.620 --> 05:29.020
Good, yeah...

05:29.740 --> 05:31.820
You know, I thought it might be nice

05:31.900 --> 05:34.820
if we spent a bit of time
together outside of work.

05:36.460 --> 05:37.820
What about the boyfriend?

05:38.020 --> 05:40.660
No, I think he'd be fine about it. Yep.

05:41.060 --> 05:42.420
- Really?
- Mmm.

05:43.580 --> 05:45.060
I wouldn't be.

05:51.180 --> 05:52.860
- I had a good time.
- Me too.

05:52.940 --> 05:55.620
And I really liked the movie. Thank you.

06:02.180 --> 06:06.300
Vera? Would you get inside and
stop making such a fool of yourself?

06:18.620 --> 06:19.700
Bea?

06:21.100 --> 06:24.820
Uh, something for you from
Debbie. Security's been through it.

06:25.140 --> 06:26.700
Oh, thanks.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.580
She, uh, must be one of the good ones.

06:30.940 --> 06:32.060
Yeah.

06:36.340 --> 06:38.900
I just wish I could get through to
her. I keep calling her but she won't...

06:38.980 --> 06:40.380
She's a teenager.

06:40.620 --> 06:41.780
Yeah.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.300
Well, keep trying.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.820
And, uh, if there's anything I can do...

06:47.900 --> 06:49.340
Let us know.

06:49.620 --> 06:50.820
Thanks.

06:53.100 --> 06:54.740
- Mr. Jackson.
- Liz.

06:55.860 --> 06:57.860
Bea. Home delivery?

07:17.060 --> 07:18.460
Hey, Doreen?

07:20.340 --> 07:22.100
Doreen? Hey.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.860
- How's peer training going?
- Yeah, good.

07:28.220 --> 07:29.860
- Hey, Toni's there.
- What?

07:29.940 --> 07:31.820
- Toni?
- Tones? Hey.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.500
- Did you know?
- Uh, I meant to tell you?

07:42.580 --> 07:44.500
You're the peer worker, you should know.

07:45.300 --> 07:46.460
Toni!

07:46.540 --> 07:48.860
Why are you sitting with the girls from H3?

07:49.420 --> 07:50.660
Is that where she's been moved to?

07:50.740 --> 07:53.060
I told you, I didn't even know
she was coming out till now.

07:57.500 --> 07:58.620
Boss wants to see you.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.140
What's going on here?

08:04.220 --> 08:05.300
Get up.

08:05.380 --> 08:06.820
Come on, don't fuck around.

08:13.100 --> 08:14.140
Hey, Tones?

08:14.220 --> 08:16.700
Remember who your friends are, mate.

08:18.300 --> 08:19.340
Toni?

08:35.059 --> 08:36.299
Come in.

08:36.940 --> 08:38.020
Sit.

08:40.419 --> 08:41.780
Here we go.

08:56.180 --> 08:57.500
Thought we'd have a little chat

08:57.580 --> 09:00.380
before you start making
friends over in the new unit.

09:02.860 --> 09:05.620
Anyone over there gonna look out for you?

09:05.700 --> 09:07.380
Keep your secrets?

09:08.940 --> 09:11.780
I haven't even asked you,
would you like a cup of tea?

09:11.860 --> 09:13.580
Would you like one?

09:18.380 --> 09:19.780
Milk? Sugar?

09:20.820 --> 09:22.180
No. Thanks.

09:35.980 --> 09:37.100
So...

09:37.420 --> 09:39.340
What should we talk about?

09:48.020 --> 09:50.180
Let's start with who
supplied you with the drugs.

10:12.820 --> 10:15.420
Hey, Miss Bennett? I like
the hair, it looks good.

10:19.980 --> 10:21.180
Franky!

10:36.100 --> 10:37.180
Hey?

10:39.980 --> 10:43.020
I grabbed some of your stuff.
There's a photo of Kaiya

10:43.100 --> 10:44.420
and some books I thought
you might like to read.

10:44.500 --> 10:45.700
Don't fucking talk to me.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.020
I'm so sorry.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.940
I was only trying to do the
right thing by you and Kaiya.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.700
You set me up.

10:57.420 --> 10:58.980
I didn't want to. I...

10:59.060 --> 11:02.580
- I didn't know what else to do, Toni.
- You were meant to look out for me.

11:03.020 --> 11:04.660
I'm really sorry.

11:05.220 --> 11:06.540
I'm so so sorry.

11:06.620 --> 11:08.020
Just fucking leave me alone.

11:45.700 --> 11:46.780
Have you lost your appetite, Tones?

11:52.700 --> 11:55.460
This Toni thing is causing a bit of a stir.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.540
They love having something
to get worked up about.

11:58.340 --> 11:59.740
Yeah, maybe.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.420
What's that?

12:02.580 --> 12:04.620
Oh, just opened. Thought
I'd check it out tonight.

12:08.140 --> 12:09.340
Can I come?

12:10.780 --> 12:12.020
Not busy with Adam?

12:13.140 --> 12:15.140
No, I don't have anything on tonight.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.180
Sure. Let's do it.

12:20.100 --> 12:23.220
And a Bachelor of Law.
It's a really big course.

12:23.780 --> 12:26.100
So you should have read
the first three chapters?

12:26.180 --> 12:27.300
Okay.

12:27.860 --> 12:29.540
So, Chapter One.

12:30.980 --> 12:33.020
The definition of a crime?

12:33.740 --> 12:36.060
Legal definition
breaching the criminal laws

12:36.140 --> 12:39.060
that aim to protect the lives,
property and rights of citizens.

12:39.140 --> 12:41.020
- Great.
- The non-legal definition

12:41.100 --> 12:43.380
acts that violate socially-accepted rules

12:43.460 --> 12:46.340
- of human, moral or ethical behavior.
- Stick to the legal.

12:46.420 --> 12:48.100
Non-legal's much more interesting.

12:48.340 --> 12:50.420
Yeah, but we can discuss it another time.

12:50.780 --> 12:54.020
Some would argue moving Toni
into another unit is a crime.

12:54.380 --> 12:56.580
I'm not discussing other
prisoners with you, Franky.

12:56.660 --> 12:59.940
- She's vulnerable.
- She can't go back to your unit.

13:00.020 --> 13:01.780
Yeah, and now she's fair game.

13:03.260 --> 13:05.460
Toni lost her privileges when Kaiya left.

13:05.540 --> 13:08.820
I mean, she can't share with
Doreen anymore, you know that.

13:08.900 --> 13:10.220
Moving on.

13:10.300 --> 13:12.740
Jurisprudence laws, customs and rights

13:12.820 --> 13:14.860
for the administration of justice.

13:15.380 --> 13:19.540
Laws control the lesser man, right
conduct controls the greater one.

13:19.780 --> 13:21.300
It's Mark Twain.

13:23.140 --> 13:24.660
It's like Toni.

13:24.820 --> 13:27.620
The right thing to do would
be to move her back in with us.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.980
Well, it depends on your
definition of right conduct.

13:31.420 --> 13:32.900
Yeah, it does.

13:36.940 --> 13:38.300
I'm here to help you.

13:38.540 --> 13:40.340
I'm here to help you.

13:45.180 --> 13:46.700
Governor?

13:46.780 --> 13:48.460
Time's up.

13:53.940 --> 13:55.860
Uh, moving Toni into H3

13:55.940 --> 13:57.180
has unsettled the women.

13:57.260 --> 14:00.260
It would unsettle them more if
they knew she requested the move.

14:00.420 --> 14:04.100
Yeah, I know, but I think we
should just keep an eye on it.

14:04.220 --> 14:05.340
Fine.

14:06.860 --> 14:08.580
What, is there something else?

14:10.060 --> 14:11.180
What?

14:11.260 --> 14:13.660
I don't think that Franky
Doyle shows you enough respect.

14:13.860 --> 14:15.620
I can handle Franky.

14:16.460 --> 14:18.540
I know it's very easy to like her but I...

14:18.620 --> 14:19.940
But I think we should draw a line.

14:20.700 --> 14:24.220
Oh, these sessions are at
the request of the department.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.660
Thank you, Governor.

14:44.660 --> 14:47.500
Oh, me bloody stitches
are all over the place!

14:47.580 --> 14:49.020
You've got to put the foot down.

14:49.340 --> 14:51.460
Oh, yeah? Will it make it go any faster?

14:52.900 --> 14:54.060
Vroom!

14:57.260 --> 14:59.380
- Hey. Look, this one.
- How many times have I told you?

14:59.460 --> 15:00.940
You've gotta make love,
not war to that thing.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.420
Yeah, well, you've got it easy.

15:03.540 --> 15:07.060
Hey, how about we swap this
for some lessons with Erica?

15:07.380 --> 15:08.460
Nah!

15:09.700 --> 15:11.860
Looking to improve
yourself, are you, Boomer?

15:12.900 --> 15:14.500
I wouldn't aim too high.

15:19.620 --> 15:22.660
I wouldn't get too close to that
thing. You know how clumsy Nana can get.

15:26.180 --> 15:27.820
- Ooh!
- What the fuck?

15:28.980 --> 15:30.100
Toni!

15:31.500 --> 15:33.260
Get Toni off her!

15:33.500 --> 15:34.900
Get off her!

15:35.020 --> 15:36.020
Toni, back off!

15:36.100 --> 15:37.500
Back off, or you're back in the slot.

15:44.740 --> 15:46.460
What's her problem?

15:47.540 --> 15:48.820
She's a loonbag.

15:55.020 --> 15:57.620
The source also raised
concerns about Miss Davidson's

15:57.700 --> 16:00.260
unorthodox methods in
dealing with the prisoners.

16:01.780 --> 16:03.020
Oh, she's gonna lose it!

16:03.380 --> 16:05.260
I reckon we'll hear it
from here when she does.

16:05.340 --> 16:06.380
Ooh, yeah!

16:06.460 --> 16:08.020
You know, I think Toni
has come out too early.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.340
The women are taking advantage of it.

16:09.940 --> 16:11.140
Check this out.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.060
You know that journo Hayley
who's been hanging around?

16:13.140 --> 16:14.780
She's dug up some dirt on Erica.

16:15.260 --> 16:17.820
A source inside Wentworth
Correctional Centre

16:17.900 --> 16:21.100
suggests that Erica Davidson
won't be sticking around for long.

16:21.900 --> 16:24.380
The source went on to say that
Davidson is overly ambitious

16:24.460 --> 16:27.900
and is using the governor's
job and her legal background

16:27.980 --> 16:30.220
as a stepping stone for entering politics.

16:30.660 --> 16:32.300
The source also raised concerns

16:32.380 --> 16:34.500
about Miss Davidson's unorthodox methods

16:34.580 --> 16:36.180
in dealing with the prisoners.

16:36.380 --> 16:38.140
Oh, can you believe it?

16:38.220 --> 16:40.140
Someone's in very deep shit!

16:41.500 --> 16:43.260
Vera? Governor wants to see you.

16:43.900 --> 16:45.300
Says it's urgent.

16:47.380 --> 16:49.460
This is gutter journalism, Karen.

16:49.540 --> 16:51.620
I thought you ran a
better newsroom than this.

16:53.100 --> 16:54.780
No, I won't give you an
interview because I know

16:54.860 --> 16:56.500
exactly what angle you'll take.

16:59.060 --> 17:01.540
Hayley won't give up her sources.
You've seen it, haven't you?

17:01.620 --> 17:02.780
Uh, yeah, just then.

17:04.140 --> 17:05.980
Do you have any idea
where the story came from?

17:06.060 --> 17:07.819
No. Of course, I have my suspicions.

17:07.900 --> 17:10.460
Matthew Fletcher has always
made his feelings clear.

17:10.540 --> 17:13.579
Um, no, Fletch wouldn't
do something like that.

17:14.819 --> 17:16.819
Have you thought about Franky Doyle?

17:17.540 --> 17:18.579
No.

17:19.099 --> 17:20.500
Why would she do it?

17:21.940 --> 17:23.619
Show the women what she can do?

17:26.060 --> 17:28.060
No, to get that sort of
information out, you'd have to...

17:28.140 --> 17:30.220
It would, um, take one phone call.

17:36.460 --> 17:38.620
I didn't do it. Why would I?

17:39.420 --> 17:41.340
Because you're angry with me.

17:41.420 --> 17:42.900
And this is how you retaliate.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.500
I'm a hell a lot smarter than that.

17:44.580 --> 17:47.020
Yeah, well, after all the
tutoring I gave you, I thought so.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.500
We both know it was more than that.

17:48.580 --> 17:51.220
- That would be your ego talking.
- That would be you in denial.

17:52.820 --> 17:54.500
I'm suspending all your privileges.

17:54.580 --> 17:55.700
You can't do that.

17:55.780 --> 17:57.700
I don't have to justify myself to you.

17:57.780 --> 17:59.540
No, but you can accuse
me of anything you want.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.300
Because I'm not the prisoner here.

18:01.380 --> 18:02.420
Yeah, but you play games like one of us.

18:02.500 --> 18:03.580
I am nothing like you.

18:03.660 --> 18:05.180
This is crazy, Erica.

18:05.260 --> 18:07.020
It is Miss Davidson!

18:13.580 --> 18:18.020
You know what? I know what it's like
to have that shit written about you.

18:18.100 --> 18:20.260
Do you really think I'd do that to you?

18:23.140 --> 18:26.100
Do you really think that I
would deliberately stir things up

18:26.180 --> 18:27.980
between you and Jacs?

18:33.180 --> 18:34.620
It wasn't me.

18:35.660 --> 18:37.140
I promise you.

18:44.620 --> 18:46.340
- Got this for you.
- Oh, thanks.

18:46.420 --> 18:48.500
- Governor?
- Yeah?

18:48.580 --> 18:50.100
How did things go with Franky Doyle?

18:50.180 --> 18:51.660
It wasn't her.

18:52.140 --> 18:53.540
Is there anyone else you think it is?

18:53.620 --> 18:56.940
I really don't care. I've got
bigger things to worry about.

19:08.740 --> 19:10.180
Here's the address for the bar.

19:11.020 --> 19:12.500
Um, thanks.

19:13.260 --> 19:14.700
Still coming?

19:14.820 --> 19:17.020
Yeah, yeah, I am, I just
can't... I can't stay too late.

19:17.100 --> 19:19.500
- Adam does wanna meet up later.
- Yeah, no worries.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.220
Er, Fletch? Look...

19:26.180 --> 19:28.300
I'm... I'm sorry about before.

19:28.380 --> 19:31.100
I think you might have
misunderstood what I meant.

19:31.180 --> 19:32.660
I just meant that we should...

19:32.740 --> 19:34.860
You know, all hang out
together at volleyball.

19:35.140 --> 19:36.220
Hmm.

19:36.780 --> 19:38.580
I don't think I did misunderstand.

19:41.060 --> 19:42.820
Well, you did. Yeah.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.580
Why are you wearing that?

19:52.660 --> 19:54.540
Um, just catching up with
some work mates for a...

19:54.620 --> 19:55.700
For a drink.

19:55.780 --> 19:57.700
- Tonight?
- Yeah, I won't be late.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.340
- But you've got work tomorrow.
- Yeah, it's just a drink.

20:00.460 --> 20:01.740
What about me?

20:02.580 --> 20:03.780
It's just a drink.

20:06.380 --> 20:08.300
I think I'm coming down with something.

20:08.380 --> 20:10.660
I've got such a sore
throat and my head's aching.

20:11.660 --> 20:13.980
I made you chicken
cacciatore, your favorite.

20:14.260 --> 20:15.940
Please don't go out
tonight. Don't leave me.

20:16.020 --> 20:17.420
Mom, please!

20:19.460 --> 20:21.340
Tell your friends I'm not feeling well

20:21.420 --> 20:23.620
and I need you to stay home.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.420
I never go out.

20:25.500 --> 20:28.260
Every time they ask me, I say no.

20:28.420 --> 20:30.020
If they're real friends,
they'll understand.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.820
No, they won't. They'll stop asking me.

20:31.900 --> 20:34.180
There's nothing wrong with staying
home, looking after your mother.

20:34.260 --> 20:36.380
That's all I ever do!

20:37.700 --> 20:39.260
I have no life.

20:39.740 --> 20:42.260
I have no friends. I have nothing.

20:43.340 --> 20:46.580
Nothing except for
this... This house and you!

20:50.820 --> 20:52.460
I'm sorry you're so unhappy!

20:52.540 --> 20:53.700
Mom...

20:54.740 --> 20:56.340
I'm not unhap...

20:59.300 --> 21:01.980
I am, I... I am unhappy.

21:02.380 --> 21:03.500
And it's my fault.

21:03.580 --> 21:04.820
No, it's not, it's my fault.

21:04.900 --> 21:06.380
For never saying what I want

21:06.460 --> 21:09.420
and for staying here and doing nothing

21:09.820 --> 21:11.260
and turning into you.

21:23.820 --> 21:26.660
You know, I can go out another
time. It doesn't have to be tonight.

21:52.060 --> 21:53.660
Hey, Mr. Jackson?

21:53.740 --> 21:55.380
Can't sleep, Bea?

21:55.460 --> 21:58.340
No, I've been trying to get hold of Debbie

21:58.420 --> 21:59.500
but I can't get through to her.

21:59.580 --> 22:00.580
Why don't you try again tomorrow?

22:00.660 --> 22:02.820
No, no, she's never there during the day.

22:02.940 --> 22:05.820
She'll be there now, so I was
wondering if I could call her?

22:06.580 --> 22:08.700
You know I can't let you use
the phones outside of hours.

22:08.780 --> 22:10.540
No, I know. I know that, but...

22:10.980 --> 22:13.220
I just think I'm going to lose it
if I don't know that she's okay,

22:13.300 --> 22:16.220
so please. I just... I
just need to talk to her.

22:16.900 --> 22:19.980
Please. You said if there was
anything that you could do to help...

22:25.100 --> 22:26.620
Harry, it's me.

22:28.340 --> 22:31.540
What do you expect? Every time
I do ring, you're never there.

22:32.500 --> 22:35.780
That's no excuse. So what's
going on with you guys?

22:36.580 --> 22:39.460
Don't give me that. I want
you to bring Debbie in.

22:39.540 --> 22:40.540
I want to know what's going on.

22:40.620 --> 22:43.620
No, you listen to me, Harry.
You bring her in, all right?

22:43.700 --> 22:45.460
Or I swear to God, I'll lose it.

22:46.660 --> 22:49.300
- No, Harry, you just do it, all right.
- Bea?

22:49.700 --> 22:51.180
Harry?

22:51.260 --> 22:52.500
Bea, come on.

22:54.380 --> 22:56.100
Let's get you back to the unit.

22:57.580 --> 22:59.100
You're welcome.

23:59.380 --> 24:00.860
I'm going out.

24:11.260 --> 24:12.860
I won't be late.

24:29.820 --> 24:31.660
Got anything stronger?

24:31.740 --> 24:33.100
- Like morphine.
- No.

24:36.740 --> 24:37.860
It was the shots.

24:38.220 --> 24:39.500
That's what did us in.

24:39.780 --> 24:42.220
- Oh, my God.
- It was worth it, though.

24:42.340 --> 24:43.380
We had fun.

24:43.460 --> 24:45.420
Mmm. Yeah.

24:46.620 --> 24:48.380
Thanks for letting me stay at your place.

24:48.460 --> 24:50.380
Thanks for canceling on Adam to kick on.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.300
He was fine about it.

24:53.260 --> 24:56.100
- If we ever recover from this...
- Mmm...

24:56.180 --> 24:58.060
- We should do it again.
- Absolutely.

24:58.140 --> 24:59.980
No getting out of karaoke next time.

25:00.060 --> 25:01.700
I'll start practicing.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.380
I know. I mean, look at her.

25:19.420 --> 25:21.940
It's hard when your friends move on.

25:22.500 --> 25:25.540
Even harder when those people who you
think are friends turn out to be...

25:25.620 --> 25:27.220
Not so friendly.

25:28.100 --> 25:30.380
Toni's been through a really rough time.

25:30.460 --> 25:33.940
Yeah, I know. She told me all
about it yesterday, poor thing.

25:34.020 --> 25:36.900
Look, I just wanna know she's okay.

25:36.980 --> 25:38.700
She's in a better place.

25:38.780 --> 25:40.260
Away from that fanny bandit.

25:42.300 --> 25:44.340
I always thought Francesca
had a cruel streak

25:44.420 --> 25:46.140
but to do that to one of her own...

25:48.820 --> 25:51.540
Have you ever asked Toni who
got her back onto the drugs?

26:09.100 --> 26:10.220
Toni!

26:12.100 --> 26:13.220
Toni?

26:22.020 --> 26:23.260
I just wanted to...

26:26.060 --> 26:28.380
Why did you go at Franky before?

26:28.500 --> 26:30.660
Did she do something to you?

26:31.500 --> 26:32.620
Toni!

26:32.860 --> 26:34.460
Please, tell me.

26:44.540 --> 26:45.740
Franky gave me the drugs.

26:45.820 --> 26:46.980
What?

26:49.300 --> 26:50.500
No way.

26:50.580 --> 26:52.420
I wouldn't fucking say
it if it wasn't true.

26:52.860 --> 26:55.380
She knew what would happen to Kaiya.

26:55.500 --> 26:57.540
She promised me she'd never do that.

26:58.140 --> 26:59.900
She made Bea a meal.

27:00.380 --> 27:01.980
Yeah, well, that was different.

27:02.180 --> 27:04.100
That was Franky showing Bea who's boss.

27:04.660 --> 27:06.820
And you reckon she wouldn't
make her do it again?

27:08.380 --> 27:10.460
She knew I couldn't say no.

27:13.140 --> 27:14.940
Franky is the family.

27:16.340 --> 27:18.140
She wouldn't do that to us.

27:18.300 --> 27:21.860
She doesn't give a shit,
Doreen. That's Franky.

27:23.780 --> 27:25.180
You hit the ball already?

27:25.380 --> 27:26.700
All right!

27:34.580 --> 27:36.180
You tell Doreen?

27:38.940 --> 27:40.180
Come in.

27:47.460 --> 27:49.980
I worry about the other moms in here.

27:51.220 --> 27:52.980
What if Franky did the same to them?

27:54.620 --> 27:56.380
I know it was hard admitting it.

27:57.260 --> 28:00.580
I did admire you for wanting to
stay quiet. It shows you're loyal.

28:01.260 --> 28:04.260
But I'm glad you told
me the truth in the end.

28:04.980 --> 28:07.780
You should probably tell the governor too.

28:09.260 --> 28:12.500
No. Jacs, I did what you asked.

28:12.820 --> 28:15.140
Think of those other
women. Those other mothers.

28:16.900 --> 28:19.380
If I lag, they'll put me in protection.

28:19.460 --> 28:21.100
The easy way to make sure you stay clean.

28:22.900 --> 28:24.580
No drugs in there.

28:25.980 --> 28:27.180
Jacs...

28:27.740 --> 28:29.660
I can't be alone again.

28:31.420 --> 28:32.620
Please...

28:32.700 --> 28:34.740
Please don't do it to me.

28:37.260 --> 28:38.540
More tea?

28:43.700 --> 28:45.700
Franky gave me the drugs.

28:49.220 --> 28:51.140
I'm sorry, I thought
you said you found them.

28:51.500 --> 28:52.740
I just said that.

28:53.140 --> 28:54.820
I didn't want to get anyone into trouble.

28:55.340 --> 28:56.780
But now you're accusing Franky.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.620
She gave them to me.

28:59.220 --> 29:00.820
So you lied about finding them?

29:00.900 --> 29:02.420
It was Franky.

29:05.700 --> 29:07.860
Did Jacs put you up to this?

29:09.380 --> 29:11.100
Toni, you realize you'll
be locked up in protection

29:11.180 --> 29:12.740
for the rest of your sentence?

29:15.020 --> 29:16.580
Is that what you want?

29:20.420 --> 29:23.380
What if the same thing happens again?

29:23.740 --> 29:25.860
What if Franky gives the
drugs to some other mother

29:25.940 --> 29:27.860
and they lose their kid like I lost mine?

29:30.420 --> 29:31.540
Um...

29:32.940 --> 29:34.060
Vera, could you please ask

29:34.140 --> 29:36.500
Mary Anne to push back my next appointment?

29:37.140 --> 29:38.340
Thanks.

29:47.380 --> 29:49.860
We both know that it wasn't Franky.

29:52.020 --> 29:53.900
- I lied.
- No, you're lying now.

29:59.300 --> 30:00.580
Prove it.

30:21.900 --> 30:23.420
Franky Doyle...

30:23.900 --> 30:26.340
I put my neck on the line for you.

30:27.700 --> 30:29.380
And this is what you do?

30:30.380 --> 30:33.500
You're charged with supplying
illicit drugs to another prisoner.

30:36.300 --> 30:37.820
I should have listened to Miss Davidson

30:37.900 --> 30:39.220
when she said you weren't worth the effort.

30:39.300 --> 30:40.460
Do you have anything to say?

30:43.780 --> 30:45.060
No point.

30:45.580 --> 30:47.220
No, you're right.

30:47.860 --> 30:49.500
There's no point.

30:51.380 --> 30:53.020
You're a complete waste of time

30:53.620 --> 30:55.180
- and resources.
- Stop it.

31:04.260 --> 31:06.900
Put her back in the slot
for an extended stay.

31:16.020 --> 31:17.860
I should have seen it.

31:21.460 --> 31:23.820
Erica? I know

31:24.820 --> 31:27.980
how easily the lines can blur
between officers and prisoners.

31:28.100 --> 31:29.860
But you've got a decision to make.

31:30.460 --> 31:33.020
Are you gonna let one of
them fuck up your career

31:33.100 --> 31:34.940
or are you gonna pull your shit
together and be the governor

31:35.020 --> 31:36.700
I know you can be?

33:13.220 --> 33:15.220
Deb. Come here.

33:15.300 --> 33:16.420
Oh...

33:20.980 --> 33:23.060
I haven't seen you in ages.

33:26.940 --> 33:28.380
Is everything okay?

33:28.700 --> 33:30.740
Yeah. It's fine, I just...

33:32.540 --> 33:34.260
I haven't been around when you've called.

33:34.820 --> 33:36.860
Yeah. We've been busy.

33:40.100 --> 33:41.820
So what's going on?

33:41.900 --> 33:43.220
God, I hate it here.

33:44.900 --> 33:47.580
If you don't want to come in, it's okay.

33:47.660 --> 33:50.020
You just talk to me on
the phone, all right?

33:50.300 --> 33:51.300
Yeah, whatever.

33:54.660 --> 33:56.180
So is your dad looking after you?

33:56.260 --> 33:57.620
- Of course I am.
- Deb?

33:59.260 --> 34:00.540
I'm fine.

34:02.780 --> 34:04.540
You don't look fine.

34:05.860 --> 34:06.980
She's fine.

34:07.060 --> 34:08.100
Yeah, well, I don't know, do I?

34:08.179 --> 34:09.540
Because you guys are
never there when I call.

34:09.620 --> 34:10.820
We're here now.

34:13.620 --> 34:14.980
Talk to me.

34:18.100 --> 34:19.260
Dad's got a new job.

34:20.100 --> 34:21.380
Oh, yeah?

34:22.739 --> 34:23.980
It means he has to travel a lot.

34:24.620 --> 34:25.699
Right.

34:26.100 --> 34:27.500
So who's going to look after Deb?

34:27.580 --> 34:28.620
I can look after myself.

34:28.699 --> 34:29.780
You're 16.

34:30.380 --> 34:32.100
And you're in jail.

34:41.260 --> 34:42.860
So who's she hanging out with?

34:42.940 --> 34:44.380
I don't know.

34:45.659 --> 34:47.340
Well, she looks like shit.

34:47.780 --> 34:49.580
You know she's been smoking?

34:49.659 --> 34:52.060
Jeez, Bea, if she smokes a
bit of dope, I don't blame her.

34:52.139 --> 34:53.420
It's not okay if she smokes a bit of dope.

34:53.500 --> 34:54.659
She's a teenager.

34:54.739 --> 34:56.420
Yeah, who's gonna be
left at home alone now.

34:57.340 --> 34:59.980
Harry? There are women in
here who have threatened Deb.

35:00.060 --> 35:02.020
They know where we live.

35:02.580 --> 35:03.740
Nothing's happened.

35:03.820 --> 35:05.060
Not yet.

35:05.220 --> 35:06.460
But you're gonna be away, aren't you?

35:06.540 --> 35:07.860
Don't start!

35:09.220 --> 35:12.620
Don't ever threaten me again,
like you did on the phone.

35:12.700 --> 35:14.860
Yeah, well, I go insane when
I don't know what's going on.

35:15.220 --> 35:16.420
You wanna know what's going on?

35:16.500 --> 35:18.340
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be nice.

35:18.420 --> 35:20.180
Well, she's out with her
mates most of the time.

35:20.980 --> 35:22.700
Which is fine by me.

35:22.780 --> 35:25.100
Because when she's home, all
she does is give me grief.

35:25.180 --> 35:26.300
God!

35:26.940 --> 35:29.180
You don't get to dump her
just because it's too hard.

35:29.980 --> 35:31.020
Yeah.

35:31.100 --> 35:33.180
Just do something right for once.

35:33.260 --> 35:35.100
You're a shit husband,
don't be a shit father.

35:35.180 --> 35:36.220
Shut the fuck up!

35:36.300 --> 35:38.940
All right. What are you gonna do? Hmm?

35:39.140 --> 35:42.300
If she doesn't stop, one day
she's gonna push me too far.

35:42.380 --> 35:43.820
Jesus!

35:44.260 --> 35:46.820
If you lay a finger on
her, I'll fucking kill you!

35:46.900 --> 35:50.020
I fucking will! I swear to God, Harry!

35:50.100 --> 35:51.140
I fucking will!

35:51.220 --> 35:52.300
We've got a code blue.

35:52.380 --> 35:53.620
I swear to God, Harry.

35:54.940 --> 35:56.540
- Mom!
- You're no good.

35:57.060 --> 35:59.020
Mom! What's he done?

35:59.420 --> 36:01.420
Nothing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

36:06.420 --> 36:08.100
Debbie, I'm sorry.

36:09.100 --> 36:10.180
Mom!

36:12.980 --> 36:14.180
Debbie?

36:24.100 --> 36:25.820
- What did you say?
- Nothing!

36:25.900 --> 36:27.580
Dad, you can't let them
treat her like this!

36:27.660 --> 36:29.700
- Calm down, Debbie.
- We have to get her out of here.

36:29.780 --> 36:30.780
I'm trying.

36:30.860 --> 36:32.060
- Oh, that's bullshit!
- Debbie!

36:32.140 --> 36:33.300
What? What are you gonna do?

36:33.380 --> 36:34.620
Okay, Debbie, you need to calm down.

36:34.700 --> 36:37.780
- I'm doing everything I can.
- No, Dad, you want her to stay here.

36:37.900 --> 36:39.460
- Stop it, Deb!
- Get off me!

36:42.900 --> 36:44.580
These visits get a bit much for her.

36:46.020 --> 36:47.180
How would you know?

36:47.260 --> 36:49.100
I'm trying to protect you
from this sort of thing.

36:56.180 --> 36:58.180
Now, you threatened your husband.

36:58.260 --> 36:59.740
Yeah, well, he's not
looking after my daughter.

36:59.820 --> 37:01.100
And you threatened to kill him.

37:01.180 --> 37:04.020
Look, everyone says stuff they
don't mean when they're angry.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.180
You know, I didn't mean it.

37:05.260 --> 37:06.780
So you admit threatening to kill him?

37:07.780 --> 37:09.860
No. No.

37:09.940 --> 37:11.700
It's a criminal offense, Bea.

37:11.780 --> 37:14.020
You're on remand, charged with the
attempted murder of your husband.

37:14.220 --> 37:15.220
But I didn't do that.

37:15.300 --> 37:17.340
You attacked him. That's serious intent.

37:17.420 --> 37:19.500
No, no, I didn't. I'm just...

37:19.580 --> 37:22.020
I'm just worried about
my daughter. That's all.

37:22.340 --> 37:24.420
Mr. Smith, do you want to
make a formal complaint?

37:24.500 --> 37:26.220
- No, you can't.
- No.

37:29.780 --> 37:32.300
I don't want to make it
any worse for my wife.

37:34.260 --> 37:36.580
Fletch? Just give her a warning.

37:38.220 --> 37:40.820
- She should be reported, mate.
- Come on, give her a break.

37:40.980 --> 37:42.140
We can't just let it go, Will.

37:42.220 --> 37:44.580
What, you know how easy
it is to lose it in here.

37:44.860 --> 37:46.820
It's just an expression.

37:46.900 --> 37:49.860
Look, next time, we give her a
box visit with her husband, okay?

37:53.260 --> 37:54.540
We'll go.

37:55.420 --> 37:56.940
Don't touch me.

38:09.100 --> 38:10.100
That's your final warning.

38:27.340 --> 38:28.500
Hello?

38:28.820 --> 38:32.060
Uh, I'm here to see Vera
Bennett. I'm her mother.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.260
Thank you.

38:39.620 --> 38:42.300
Mrs. Bennett, nice to meet you.
I'm Linda, a friend of Vera's.

38:42.380 --> 38:43.380
Really?

38:43.500 --> 38:45.740
Oh, I brought her some things.

38:46.180 --> 38:48.020
She didn't come home last night.

38:48.100 --> 38:50.500
Oh, right, yeah, she crashed at my place.

38:50.580 --> 38:52.620
Don't worry too much, we all
keep some spares in our lockers.

38:53.660 --> 38:55.340
I'll call her, get her to come right down.

38:56.380 --> 38:59.580
Zero-one, calling zero-three,
you're wanted at reception. Over.

38:59.980 --> 39:01.340
This is zero-three. Is it urgent?

39:01.460 --> 39:02.820
It's your mother. Over.

39:04.660 --> 39:06.500
Yeah, copy that. Over.

39:09.340 --> 39:11.540
So where did you girls get to last night?

39:12.540 --> 39:13.580
Just some bar in the city.

39:13.660 --> 39:15.820
We were going to go for dinner
after that but we didn't make it.

39:15.900 --> 39:18.100
- That sounds nice.
- Yeah, love a good girls' night.

39:18.260 --> 39:20.580
Can't believe Adam finally
gave Vera a leave pass.

39:20.780 --> 39:21.980
Leave pass?

39:22.260 --> 39:23.660
Yeah. Night away from Adam.

39:23.740 --> 39:24.740
Who's Adam?

39:26.500 --> 39:27.580
Her boyfriend.

39:28.060 --> 39:29.860
I don't know what Vera's told you but...

39:29.940 --> 39:31.460
She's never had one.

39:31.740 --> 39:33.100
She hasn't?

39:33.500 --> 39:36.340
She's never had a boyfriend, she's too shy.

39:45.620 --> 39:47.820
Mom, just... Just come
with me, come with me.

39:48.460 --> 39:49.820
Come on, this way.

39:50.020 --> 39:51.180
This way, come on.

39:55.420 --> 39:58.260
- You've gotta keep it together, Bea.
- Yeah, I know.

39:58.980 --> 40:00.580
Hey, Mr. Jackson?

40:01.140 --> 40:03.620
Uh, just, thanks for standing up for me.

40:04.020 --> 40:05.180
Look, I know things are tough with Debbie

40:05.260 --> 40:07.460
but you've got to look
after yourself first, okay?

40:07.860 --> 40:08.980
Yeah.

40:09.540 --> 40:10.660
Good.

40:12.620 --> 40:13.700
Bea?

40:14.900 --> 40:16.260
You be careful of him.

40:17.220 --> 40:18.420
He was just being kind.

40:19.180 --> 40:22.460
It's never just anything.
There's always something.

40:52.700 --> 40:56.060
You know, last time I checked,
we had some tables and chairs.

40:58.140 --> 41:01.020
I just want to finish
this before I go home.

41:01.140 --> 41:02.900
- Real peace and quiet?
- Yep.

41:03.820 --> 41:07.260
You know, rumor has it
you're a bit of a bullshitter.

41:22.820 --> 41:24.340
My mother is...

41:29.580 --> 41:32.500
I can't have friends, so I...

41:37.860 --> 41:39.380
I made up Adam.

42:14.220 --> 42:16.300
Thought I'd give you the night off cooking.

42:19.820 --> 42:22.980
Um, I'm not actually that hungry.

42:26.860 --> 42:28.180
Hey, you look tired.

42:28.260 --> 42:29.940
It'll do you good.

42:52.220 --> 42:53.980
You're all I've got.

42:57.100 --> 42:59.620
I don't know what I'd do without you.

43:03.660 --> 43:05.140
I'm here, Mom.
