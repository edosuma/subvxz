LOUIE ( <i>over speaker</i> ):
Resnick, you got cab 529.

00:56.267 --> 00:58.267
Capasso...

00:58.300 --> 01:00.267
cab 111.

01:00.300 --> 01:01.334
Come on, let's
get out of here

01:01.367 --> 01:02.634
and get some breakfast.
I'm hungry.

01:02.667 --> 01:03.767
Good idea.
Let's go.

01:03.801 --> 01:05.334
Hey, listen, Louie,
when Alex comes in

01:05.367 --> 01:07.033
would you just tell him
we're at Mario's?

01:07.067 --> 01:09.200
He won't be in for a while.

01:09.234 --> 01:11.434
Hamill, 120.

01:11.467 --> 01:12.167
How come?

01:12.200 --> 01:13.434
He got shot.

01:13.467 --> 01:15.601
What?!
De la
Grazzi...

01:15.634 --> 01:16.868
829.
What do you mean,

01:16.901 --> 01:18.000
he got shot, Louie?

01:18.033 --> 01:19.167
What happened?

01:19.200 --> 01:21.200
Some guy robbed him
and shot him.

01:21.234 --> 01:22.868
Lucia, 338.

01:22.901 --> 01:25.000
For God's sakes,
Louie, where is he?

01:25.033 --> 01:26.701
Is he all right?
Is he alive?

01:26.734 --> 01:29.033
Last time I talked to him,
he was.

01:29.067 --> 01:30.901
They took him to Mt. Sinai.

01:30.934 --> 01:32.400
Liebowitz, 226.

01:32.434 --> 01:34.200
Louie, how can you just
sit there like that?

01:34.234 --> 01:35.968
I mean, come on!
Don't you care about Alex?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.200
Aren't you worried about him?

01:37.234 --> 01:39.067
Of course I care about him.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.567
What kind of heel
you think I am?

01:41.601 --> 01:43.400
Drago, 829.

01:43.434 --> 01:44.868
Come on, let's go to
the hospital. Come on.

01:44.901 --> 01:45.968
( <i>indistinct voices</i> )

01:46.000 --> 01:47.267
You're a
sick person.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.868
JOHN:
Huh. Hey. What are
you doing here?

01:49.901 --> 01:51.067
Huh?
Louie said
you got shot.

01:51.100 --> 01:52.901
Yeah, I did.

01:52.934 --> 01:53.901
Well, are you okay?

01:53.934 --> 01:56.300
Huh?
Are you okay?

01:56.334 --> 01:58.601
Of course he's okay.
The bullet just nicked his ear.

01:58.634 --> 02:00.767
Yeah, it was just a scratch.
I'm fine, really.

02:01.801 --> 02:02.901
That's all?

02:02.934 --> 02:04.968
Oh, the doctor said that since
the gun went off

02:05.000 --> 02:06.501
close to my ear,
that I might have

02:06.534 --> 02:08.467
a little trouble hearing
every now and then.

02:08.501 --> 02:10.067
But I don't seem
to notice anything.

02:10.100 --> 02:11.801
So, there's nothing else wrong?

02:11.834 --> 02:13.200
Huh? No, it didn't take long.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.133
He just put a bandage here
and let me go.

02:15.167 --> 02:16.133
It's okay.

02:16.167 --> 02:17.834
Boy, you were
really lucky.

02:17.868 --> 02:19.467
I'll say.
BOBBY:
Yeah.

02:19.501 --> 02:20.400
What?

02:23.601 --> 02:25.734
Boy, you were
really lucky.

02:26.901 --> 02:27.901
I'll say.

02:27.934 --> 02:29.133
Oh.

02:29.167 --> 02:30.234
Yeah.

02:31.267 --> 02:33.133
Yeah, yeah, it
was really crazy.

02:33.167 --> 02:34.501
You know, I-I just let
this guy off,

02:34.534 --> 02:36.367
and all of a sudden,
he sticks a gun in my face.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.067
Oh...
He asked me to give
him all my money.

02:38.100 --> 02:40.067
I told him that most of it
was locked in a strongbox

02:40.100 --> 02:41.133
and I didn't have the key.

02:41.167 --> 02:42.534
He didn't buy that.

02:42.567 --> 02:44.300
So, uh... then I heard him
cock the gun.

02:44.334 --> 02:46.934
I mean, I really got frightened.
I didn't know what to do.

02:46.968 --> 02:49.367
So, I stepped on the gas,
the gun went off, and, zing.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.200
You know.
That <i>is</i> scary.

02:51.234 --> 02:53.367
Boy, you read about these things
happening all the time,

02:53.400 --> 02:55.267
but you never think
it's going to happen to you.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.968
What makes you think
it was a Jew?

03:03.734 --> 03:06.367
Oh, uh, just a hunch.

03:07.868 --> 03:10.400
Well, listen, I-I'm going
to go home and get some sleep.

03:10.434 --> 03:11.834
I'll see you guys later, okay?

03:11.868 --> 03:13.133
Okay. Alex?
Yeah, take it
easy, man.

03:13.167 --> 03:14.601
You know what?
Don't come in tomorrow.

03:14.634 --> 03:15.667
I mean, why don't you just

03:15.701 --> 03:17.133
take a couple days off?

03:17.167 --> 03:18.567
You know, rest, relax.

03:18.601 --> 03:20.534
Oh, thanks.
I got them on sale.

03:20.567 --> 03:21.901
You like them?

03:22.901 --> 03:24.067
Huh?
Alex?

03:24.100 --> 03:26.100
Yeah?
Why don't you take
a couple days off?

03:26.133 --> 03:28.367
I mean, an experience
like this has got to
have an effect on you.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.801
No, no, no, no.
I'm fine, Elaine.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.467
I really am.
You know the old saying--

03:31.501 --> 03:33.734
you fall off a horse, you
got to get right back on.

03:33.767 --> 03:35.968
Yeah, but I don't know
if the same old saying applies

03:36.000 --> 03:37.200
to getting <i>shot</i>
off a horse.

03:37.234 --> 03:39.334
Oh, Elaine, I'm okay.
Really, I'm okay.
Believe me.

03:39.367 --> 03:41.567
Hey-hey, Alex, did you
get a good look

03:41.601 --> 03:43.000
at the guy
who shot you?

03:43.033 --> 03:44.767
Oh, all I saw
was his big gun.

03:44.801 --> 03:47.767
Oh, yeah, he had a word
tattooed across his fist--

03:47.801 --> 03:49.934
"kill."

03:49.968 --> 03:53.133
Never, <i>never</i> pick up

03:53.167 --> 03:55.567
any people with tattoos.

03:55.601 --> 03:56.901
That's a
cardinal rule.

03:56.934 --> 04:01.334
They're all morons,
maniacs and lowlifes.

04:01.367 --> 04:03.567
Hey, Louie, I got a tattoo.

04:03.601 --> 04:05.901
Oh, yeah, and losers.

04:14.567 --> 04:17.399
LOUIE ( <i>over dispatch</i> ):
Hey, Alex.

04:17.434 --> 04:19.033
Yeah, Louie?

04:19.067 --> 04:20.701
You all right?

04:20.733 --> 04:22.033
Yeah, sure, Louie.

04:22.067 --> 04:23.367
Are you certain?

04:23.400 --> 04:24.868
No, it's not
hurting a bit.

04:24.901 --> 04:27.534
I'm okay.

04:27.567 --> 04:30.267
Look, Alex, I know you must be
feeling a little nervous

04:30.300 --> 04:32.267
after what happened last night,

04:32.300 --> 04:35.033
so I don't want you
to feel any pressure.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.968
Don't pick up anybody
who don't look right to you

04:38.000 --> 04:40.667
and stay out of
the bad neighborhoods.

04:40.701 --> 04:43.701
If you don't book so good,
it don't matter to me.

04:43.734 --> 04:46.067
Well, thanks, Louie.

04:46.100 --> 04:49.000
All right, Nardo,
I read your crummy speech.

04:49.033 --> 04:50.934
Now where's my five dollars?

04:52.267 --> 04:55.300
Uh, look, Elaine, Elaine,
please don't worry about me.

04:55.334 --> 04:57.334
It's no big deal, huh?

05:00.767 --> 05:02.367
MAN:
Taxi!

05:04.701 --> 05:06.534
Sorry, off duty.

05:07.868 --> 05:09.567
I'll pick up the next one.

05:09.601 --> 05:11.000
MAN #2:
Cab!

05:12.701 --> 05:16.300
Next one that doesn't have
a safety pin through his nose.

05:20.067 --> 05:21.400
MAN #3:
Taxi!

05:28.567 --> 05:30.367
Good evening, Father.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.868
Front Street
by Pier Six, please.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.634
What church is down there?

05:35.667 --> 05:36.801
I don't know.

05:36.834 --> 05:38.634
I-I don't think there is one.

05:39.901 --> 05:42.534
That's a pretty desolate
area at night.

05:42.567 --> 05:44.734
Guess you must have
your reasons

05:44.767 --> 05:46.200
for going there, huh?

05:46.234 --> 05:48.067
Uh-huh.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.200
You seem sort of, uh,
young to be a priest.

05:54.234 --> 05:55.701
You been one long?

05:55.734 --> 05:56.934
Uh-uh.

06:00.267 --> 06:02.501
Uh, Louie, this is
Alex, listen...

06:02.534 --> 06:05.200
I'm busy!
Call back in an hour.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.000
That's my dispatcher.

06:08.033 --> 06:11.067
We keep in constant contact
here, you know.

06:18.667 --> 06:20.234
( <i>chuckling nervously</i> )

06:20.267 --> 06:23.734
You know... say, a couple of
guys down at the garage and I

06:23.767 --> 06:26.067
were having this little
argument, you know.

06:26.100 --> 06:29.234
Maybe you can clear it up
for me, uh, Father.

06:29.267 --> 06:31.334
Um... yeah, we had
this big fight

06:31.367 --> 06:35.000
about who the 12 Apostles were,
and, uh, I figured, uh...

06:35.033 --> 06:37.767
you being a priest,
why, you'd know, right?

06:37.801 --> 06:40.367
You had a fight
over the 12 Apostles?

06:40.400 --> 06:41.767
( <i>laughs</i> )

06:41.801 --> 06:43.267
Yeah.

06:43.300 --> 06:45.734
I bet you could
rattle off their names

06:45.767 --> 06:46.801
in nothing flat.

06:46.834 --> 06:48.934
Would you do that
for me, Father?

06:48.968 --> 06:52.400
Rattle them off in nothing flat?

06:52.434 --> 06:55.634
I suppose so,
if you like.

06:55.667 --> 06:57.167
Uh, let's see...

06:57.200 --> 07:00.734
uh, Peter, Matthew,
Judas, Andrew...

07:00.767 --> 07:04.100
James the younger,
James the elder,

07:04.133 --> 07:06.501
Bartholomew... Simon...

07:06.534 --> 07:08.000
That's eight.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.000
John.

07:11.033 --> 07:13.634
Do you really need
to know this?

07:13.667 --> 07:15.434
It would mean
a lot to me

07:15.467 --> 07:18.067
and the guys at
the garage... Father.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.734
Thomas and Jude.

07:20.767 --> 07:23.200
One more.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.133
Did I say Andrew?

07:25.167 --> 07:27.367
Yeah, you said Andrew already.

07:28.534 --> 07:30.200
Well, it's not Sneezy.

07:34.601 --> 07:38.067
No, I don't think
it is Sneezy.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.234
I'm sorry,
I don't remember.

07:42.634 --> 07:43.801
( <i>tires squeal</i> )

07:43.834 --> 07:45.467
All right, get
out of the cab!
What?

07:45.501 --> 07:47.234
I said get out of the cab!
Get out of the cab!

07:47.267 --> 07:49.033
Try it on some other sucker.
Get out of here...

07:49.067 --> 07:50.534
I'll call the cops!
I'll call the cops!

07:50.567 --> 07:53.100
( <i>engine revving</i> )

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Wow, that was a close one.

08:11.033 --> 08:12.434
Boy, that's really something.

08:12.467 --> 08:13.801
Everybody's
totally paranoid

08:13.834 --> 08:15.701
after what happened
to Alex last night.

08:15.734 --> 08:18.000
They're all stealing
Latka's tools for weapons.

08:18.033 --> 08:19.000
It's crazy.

08:19.033 --> 08:20.334
What'd you get?

08:20.367 --> 08:21.534
A wrench.

08:22.734 --> 08:24.100
Uh, in my opinion,

08:24.133 --> 08:26.167
the best weapon is
reasonable communication.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.934
The tongue is mightier
than the sword.

08:27.968 --> 08:31.367
Talk like that's a good way
to get your tongue cut off.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.634
I heard about this guy once

08:32.667 --> 08:35.100
who faked a heart attack
while he was getting mugged.

08:35.133 --> 08:36.299
Scared the mugger off.

08:36.333 --> 08:37.366
You know, I could do that.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.567
Uh, you'd have to be
pretty convincing.

08:39.601 --> 08:40.900
Hey, I'm an actor, man.

08:40.933 --> 08:43.234
You know, I can convince anybody
of anything, you know.

08:43.267 --> 08:45.667
Yeah?
Yeah, you want to see
a heart attack?

08:45.701 --> 08:47.234
ELAINE:
Yeah.

08:47.267 --> 08:49.100
All right.
Okay, heart attack.

08:51.701 --> 08:53.133
( <i>gulps</i> )

08:53.167 --> 08:54.267
Oh...

08:54.300 --> 08:57.400
( <i>gasping</i> )

09:00.767 --> 09:02.534
What's the matter
with you?

09:02.567 --> 09:04.901
( <i>gasping</i> ):
I'm having a heart attack.

09:04.934 --> 09:06.033
Well, have it somewheres else.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.501
I could've tripped
and broke my neck.

09:14.868 --> 09:16.834
See? I convinced him.

09:16.868 --> 09:18.801
Yeah.
Play some rummy?

09:18.834 --> 09:19.834
Yeah. Let me get my...

09:19.868 --> 09:21.000
Hi, Alex.

09:21.033 --> 09:22.033
Hey, Alex, how's
your ear?

09:22.067 --> 09:23.601
How do you feel?

09:23.634 --> 09:25.667
( <i>indistinct voices</i> )

09:29.667 --> 09:31.701
You booked
absolutely nothing?

09:32.567 --> 09:34.367
That's not too good, Alex.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.934
I quit.

09:35.968 --> 09:37.801
You're not used to criticism,
are you?

09:39.801 --> 09:42.868
Look, Louie, I had a lot of time
to think about this last night.

09:42.901 --> 09:45.767
I see you had a lot of time.

09:45.801 --> 09:47.367
I don't want
to drive a cab anymore.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.601
Alex... Alex!

09:48.634 --> 09:49.968
Huh?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.367
Come in here.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.501
What do you want?

09:52.534 --> 09:53.567
Come over here.

09:56.567 --> 09:58.367
What are you
talking about?

09:58.400 --> 09:59.534
You can't quit.

09:59.567 --> 10:01.133
You're my best booker.

10:01.167 --> 10:02.968
Louie, I almost got
killed the other night.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.334
One guy out of a city
of eight million

10:06.367 --> 10:09.067
tries to blow your brains out,

10:09.100 --> 10:11.934
you want to make
a federal case out of it.

10:11.968 --> 10:14.100
Now look, Louie,
I'm serious. I quit.

10:20.434 --> 10:24.567
Rieger, you leave,
it's costing me a lot of money.

10:24.601 --> 10:26.334
Ah! But that doesn't matter.

10:26.367 --> 10:28.133
Because who cares
about money

10:28.167 --> 10:30.934
when people's personal feelings
are involved?

10:30.968 --> 10:32.300
( <i>chuckles</i> )

10:32.334 --> 10:35.267
Now, how's this going to affect
your fellow drivers?

10:35.300 --> 10:38.734
Next to me, they look up to you
more than anyone else in here.

10:38.767 --> 10:41.300
Now, how are you going to
break the news to them?

10:41.334 --> 10:43.968
I don't know. I thought I'd
do something like this.

10:45.300 --> 10:47.300
Hey, everybody,
I'm quitting.

10:47.334 --> 10:48.300
What?!
What for?

10:48.334 --> 10:50.000
What are you
talking about
What do you mean?

10:50.033 --> 10:51.300
Well, it's very simple.
I'm scared.

10:51.334 --> 10:52.534
Well, sure,
you're a
little scared.

10:52.567 --> 10:54.200
I mean, after
what happened
the other night...

10:54.234 --> 10:56.634
No, John, I'm not
just a little scared.

10:56.667 --> 10:58.734
I'm a <i>little</i> scared
of spiders and snakes,

10:58.767 --> 11:00.334
but driving a cab terrifies me.

11:00.367 --> 11:01.501
Well, what about what you said

11:01.534 --> 11:02.767
about climbing back
on the horse?

11:02.801 --> 11:05.367
Yeah, well, me and Old Paint
didn't book a dime last night.

11:05.400 --> 11:06.968
Alex, listen, I can
really understand

11:07.000 --> 11:09.367
what you're going through,
but quitting, man, is crazy.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.667
Well, picking up
total strangers

11:10.701 --> 11:11.734
in the middle
of the night

11:11.767 --> 11:13.300
and driving
wherever they tell you to

11:13.334 --> 11:14.300
isn't exactly sane.

11:14.334 --> 11:15.667
Who does that?

11:17.133 --> 11:18.300
We do.

11:18.334 --> 11:19.567
Oh, yeah.

11:21.133 --> 11:23.267
Quitting!

11:23.300 --> 11:25.868
The man is quitting.

11:25.901 --> 11:29.667
Well, maybe I'm using
the word "man" too loosely.

11:31.067 --> 11:34.300
You're a lily-livered,
yellow-bellied,

11:34.334 --> 11:38.334
namby-pamby,
mealymouth chicken!

11:41.467 --> 11:42.968
You're right, Louie.

11:44.100 --> 11:45.901
Can't reason with the guy.

11:45.934 --> 11:47.934
I still don't believe
what I'm hearing.

11:47.968 --> 11:50.367
Alex, you've been driving
a cab for ten years.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.567
What are you going to
do if you quit, huh?

11:52.601 --> 11:54.534
There are a lot of things
I could do.

11:54.567 --> 11:55.534
Yeah, like what?

11:55.567 --> 11:56.934
I used to be
an upholsterer.

11:56.968 --> 11:58.534
I could go back
to doing that.

11:58.567 --> 11:59.534
Oh, whoopie-doo.

11:59.567 --> 12:00.601
Tending bar--

12:00.634 --> 12:02.000
I did that for a while.

12:02.033 --> 12:04.167
Yeah, well, they get
held up, too, you know.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.234
I was a waiter once.
That's a possibility.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.868
Oh, exciting.

12:07.901 --> 12:09.567
You could make cheese.

12:09.601 --> 12:11.501
Why would I want
to do that?

12:11.534 --> 12:13.067
Somebody has to.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.367
Yeah, good point.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.200
Look, I'm not worried
about finding a job.

12:19.234 --> 12:21.701
Yeah, but Alex,
you like driving.

12:21.734 --> 12:22.868
Well, who wouldn't?

12:22.901 --> 12:24.200
It's a great job.

12:24.234 --> 12:26.100
You're outside cruising
in the fresh air.

12:26.133 --> 12:28.267
You wear what you want,
you work when you want.

12:28.300 --> 12:30.334
It's the kind of job
you can really make out

12:30.367 --> 12:31.567
without killing yourself.

12:31.601 --> 12:33.868
Yeah, somebody else
will do that for you.

12:33.901 --> 12:35.901
Look, I've thought about this
a lot,

12:35.934 --> 12:37.734
and I've come to the conclusion

12:37.767 --> 12:40.167
my life is worth more
than 55 cents a mile.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.801
Now, I can't handle it anymore,
and that's it.

12:42.834 --> 12:45.400
Wow, we're all
really going
to miss you.

12:45.434 --> 12:47.367
Yeah, it's...
it's going to be

12:47.400 --> 12:48.901
weird around here
without you.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.267
It sure is.

12:52.767 --> 12:55.601
Hey, come on,
we'll keep in touch.

12:55.634 --> 12:57.734
I'll drop by, you'll drop by.

12:57.767 --> 12:59.033
I mean, you know how it goes.

12:59.067 --> 13:00.734
I mean, a guy leaves
the neighborhood,

13:00.767 --> 13:02.801
you see him more
than when he lived next door.

13:02.834 --> 13:03.801
You know that.

13:03.834 --> 13:04.934
Yeah, sure.

13:04.968 --> 13:06.667
Yeah, we'll still
be tight, right?

13:06.701 --> 13:07.667
Sure.

13:07.701 --> 13:08.434
Right.

13:08.467 --> 13:09.834
Right.

13:09.868 --> 13:12.767
Okay.

13:12.801 --> 13:14.667
I, uh...
Oh...

13:34.367 --> 13:36.000
Please!

13:55.467 --> 13:58.467
I'm going to hate
myself in the morning.

13:58.501 --> 14:00.567
Well, I guess I'll see you...

14:00.601 --> 14:01.634
Okay.

14:14.767 --> 14:16.767
( <i>snaps fingers</i> )

14:21.501 --> 14:23.033
Are we ready
to order?

14:23.067 --> 14:24.033
I think so.

14:24.067 --> 14:25.601
Uh, how's
your escargot?

14:25.634 --> 14:27.667
My car goes fine,
why do you ask?

14:28.868 --> 14:31.567
Is there something wrong
with your hearing?

14:31.601 --> 14:33.234
I'm sorry,
we don't serve herring,

14:33.267 --> 14:34.934
but I can recommend
the escargot.

14:36.467 --> 14:38.434
Fine, uh, just
bring us those,

14:38.467 --> 14:40.968
and we'll decide
on our entree later.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.501
Very good, sir.

14:50.767 --> 14:53.734
Wow, Alex said he was working
at a posh place,

14:53.767 --> 14:56.334
but I never expected
anything like this.

14:56.367 --> 14:57.534
Good evening.

14:57.567 --> 15:00.167
Yes, reservations
for Dr. Wheeler.

15:01.334 --> 15:04.100
Ah, yes, Dr. Wheeler,
party of four, yes?

15:04.133 --> 15:05.267
Yes.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.267
Follow me... Doctor.

15:06.300 --> 15:07.534
I'll show you
to your table.

15:09.534 --> 15:10.868
Dr. Wheeler?

15:10.901 --> 15:13.000
Well, it's easier
to get reservations

15:13.033 --> 15:15.901
at joints like this
if they think
you're a doctor.

15:15.934 --> 15:19.467
So, uh, how'd that heart job
go this morning, Doc?

15:19.501 --> 15:21.601
Madame.

15:23.133 --> 15:24.434
 <i>Bon appetit.</i>

15:24.467 --> 15:25.634
 <i>Merci.</i>

15:25.667 --> 15:26.534
 <i>Touché.</i>

15:28.534 --> 15:30.400
Will you stop trying
to embarrass me, huh?

15:30.434 --> 15:31.167
What did I do?

15:31.200 --> 15:32.167
What do you...?

15:32.200 --> 15:33.367
Hey, look at all
the silverware

15:33.400 --> 15:34.868
they give you here.
Isn't this great?

15:37.200 --> 15:38.434
Good evening.

15:38.467 --> 15:39.434
My name is Richard.

15:39.467 --> 15:41.167
I'll be serving you
this evening.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.868
Are you the waiter
for this table?

15:42.901 --> 15:43.934
Yes.

15:43.968 --> 15:45.868
Then we'd like to sit
somewhere else.

15:46.968 --> 15:48.033
Excuse me.

15:48.067 --> 15:49.968
Um, I'm sure
you're an excellent waiter.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.534
However, we know another waiter

15:51.567 --> 15:54.033
from the establishment
at which he worked formerly.

15:54.067 --> 15:55.634
And, um,
Alex Rieger is his name.

15:55.667 --> 15:58.634
We would very much like
for him to serve us.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.767
I hope you understand.

16:00.801 --> 16:03.367
Not entirely.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.868
But I'll get him.

16:04.901 --> 16:06.601
Oh, thank you
so much.

16:06.634 --> 16:10.133
Why am I talking
like the Queen of England?

16:12.234 --> 16:13.534
Hey, you know, I've been

16:13.567 --> 16:15.567
to some pretty great places
in my life,

16:15.601 --> 16:17.300
but this place beats them all.

16:17.334 --> 16:18.601
There ain't even no gum

16:18.634 --> 16:19.601
stuck to this table.

16:19.634 --> 16:20.667
Will you put it...?

16:23.033 --> 16:25.167
Uh, good evening.
My name is Alex.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.734
Hey, Alex!
Oh!
Hi, Alex!

16:26.767 --> 16:28.601
You look
really terrific.
Do I? huh?

16:28.634 --> 16:30.834
Oh, yeah,
cummerbunds become you.

16:30.868 --> 16:32.501
Here, pull up
a chair.

16:32.534 --> 16:33.901
Oh, no, thanks, Tony, I can't.

16:33.934 --> 16:35.434
I have six tables
to take care of.

16:35.467 --> 16:37.901
I have to be kind of mobile,
if you know what I mean.

16:37.934 --> 16:39.467
Well, we just thought
we'd stop by,

16:39.501 --> 16:41.167
you know, say hello,
and have a bite.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.167
Yes, it's really great
to see you people.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.434
Um, like me to get you
something to drink?

16:45.467 --> 16:46.634
Yeah, I'd love a brew.

16:46.667 --> 16:48.467
Oh.

16:48.501 --> 16:49.801
So, how's it going?

16:49.834 --> 16:50.968
Very well, Tony.
Very well.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.334
Listen, why don't I buy you
a bottle of wine, huh?

16:53.367 --> 16:54.334
What do you say?

16:54.367 --> 16:55.501
Oh...
Oh...

16:55.534 --> 16:57.167
Hey...
What do you like?
Red? White? Rosé?

16:57.200 --> 16:59.334
White rosé would be great.

17:02.834 --> 17:04.968
Okay.
An excellent choice, Tony.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.334
Yeah, and bring some peanuts.

17:06.367 --> 17:07.501
Right.

17:08.501 --> 17:10.634
I can't believe
Alex is doing this.

17:10.666 --> 17:12.800
It's hard to keep
a straight face.

17:12.834 --> 17:15.267
He seems to like it
here okay, huh?

17:15.300 --> 17:17.166
Yeah.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.000
Wow, he must be
cleaning up.

17:19.032 --> 17:22.800
15% of the price of a cup
of coffee is a great tip.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.133
Hmm!

17:24.166 --> 17:26.267
Here we are.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.400
Oh.

17:27.434 --> 17:28.099
Hmm?

17:28.133 --> 17:29.267
Whoo, that's nice, Alex.

17:29.300 --> 17:30.767
Would you like me
to open it now?

17:30.801 --> 17:32.801
No, don't bother,
we'll do it ourselves.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.701
That's okay, Tony.
It's okay.

17:37.100 --> 17:38.133
( <i>chuckles</i> )

17:38.167 --> 17:39.701
Alex?
Yes?

17:39.734 --> 17:42.567
Alex, is, uh, this really
awkward for you?

17:42.601 --> 17:45.868
What, you people coming here
and my having to wait on you?

17:45.901 --> 17:47.033
Uh-huh.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.734
Yes, it's as awkward as hell.

17:48.767 --> 17:51.234
Hey, would you feel
better if we left?

17:51.267 --> 17:52.400
Now, truth.

17:52.434 --> 17:54.033
Oh, come on, I'm just kidding.

17:54.067 --> 17:56.200
Hey, come on. You're my friends.
Don't be silly.

17:56.234 --> 17:59.467
Besides, I understand you people
are going to be great tippers.

17:59.501 --> 18:00.467
Hey, uh, Alex?

18:00.501 --> 18:01.567
Hmm?

18:01.601 --> 18:03.801
I think it's ladies first.

18:03.834 --> 18:05.200
Oh.

18:05.234 --> 18:06.968
Thanks for
your help, Tony.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.334
WOMAN:
Waiter.

18:10.667 --> 18:11.701
Mmm.

18:11.734 --> 18:12.767
Mmm?

18:12.801 --> 18:14.000
( <i>whispers</i> ):
It's wonderful.

18:14.033 --> 18:15.167
Waiter?

18:15.200 --> 18:16.868
BOBBY:
Uh, I'd like
to propose a toast.

18:16.901 --> 18:18.200
Waiter.

18:18.234 --> 18:19.734
Will you keep
your drawers on, lady?

18:19.767 --> 18:20.868
The guy's got six tables.

18:20.901 --> 18:22.234
He can't be
everywhere at once.

18:27.634 --> 18:30.667
I just wanted some water.

18:30.701 --> 18:32.701
Listen, I'll be right back.

18:36.067 --> 18:38.033
You happy?

18:40.200 --> 18:41.834
It's okay, Alex.
I took care of it.

18:41.868 --> 18:43.200
Oh, thank you.

18:45.033 --> 18:46.300
Uh... all right.

18:46.334 --> 18:47.834
How are we?

18:47.868 --> 18:49.133
We're doing good.

18:49.167 --> 18:50.901
Hey, let's, uh,
have a toast.

18:50.934 --> 18:52.534
Oh, yeah, okay.

18:52.567 --> 18:54.200
Oh, yeah, anyway...

18:54.234 --> 18:55.534
to our good
friend, Alex.

18:55.567 --> 18:56.868
Oh, please.

18:56.901 --> 18:59.000
And one good
waiter, too,
if you ask me.

18:59.033 --> 19:00.334
ALL:
Hear, hear.

19:00.367 --> 19:02.100
Thank you,
thank you, folks.

19:02.133 --> 19:04.434
Okay, are we
ready to order?

19:04.467 --> 19:05.601
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

19:05.634 --> 19:07.467
Um, let's see,
I'm gonna st...

19:07.501 --> 19:10.434
I'll have
the spinach salad.

19:10.467 --> 19:12.067
Oh, listen, I'll
split one with you.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.200
Just put extra
bacon bits

19:13.234 --> 19:14.501
on my half,
all right?
Okay.

19:16.300 --> 19:18.934
Gee, it seems such
a shame not to order

19:18.968 --> 19:21.334
French food in a
French restaurant.

19:21.367 --> 19:22.601
Uh, tell me... uh,

19:22.634 --> 19:25.400
how are the potatoes
au gratin prepared?

19:29.367 --> 19:30.767
With cheese.

19:30.801 --> 19:33.300
Very interesting.

19:33.334 --> 19:35.367
That's what I
think I'll have--

19:35.400 --> 19:37.567
potatoes au gratin,
with cheese.

19:39.267 --> 19:41.767
What the heck.
Give me the potatoes au gratin--

19:41.801 --> 19:43.133
only without the cheese.

19:44.801 --> 19:47.767
Okay, let's see if
I've got this right, now.

19:47.801 --> 19:49.701
That's, uh, pheasant pate,
vichyssoise,

19:49.734 --> 19:51.200
endive salad, duck <i>a l'orange</i>

19:51.234 --> 19:53.367
chocolate mousse and espresso
all for four.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.667
Alex, what are...?

19:54.701 --> 19:56.000
It's on me.

19:56.033 --> 19:58.467
Aw, Alex, we can't
let you do that.

19:58.501 --> 19:59.801
Are you kidding?
Listen, I make

19:59.834 --> 20:02.000
almost twice as much here
as I did at the garage.

20:02.033 --> 20:04.100
Now, it's on me,
and that's all there is to it.

20:04.133 --> 20:08.133
Well, gee, I mean, like,
well... thanks.

20:08.167 --> 20:09.300
You're welcome.

20:09.334 --> 20:11.434
ELAINE:
You know, Alex, uh...

20:11.467 --> 20:13.734
I guess we all came here tonight
sort of hoping

20:13.767 --> 20:15.767
it wasn't working out
for you as a waiter.

20:15.801 --> 20:18.267
And you know, maybe you'd come
back to the garage.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.133
But I-I guess
there's no chance of that, huh?

20:20.167 --> 20:22.901
You know, strangely enough,
I was laying awake last night

20:22.934 --> 20:24.334
thinking about whether or not

20:24.367 --> 20:26.000
I should go back
to driving a cab.

20:26.033 --> 20:27.667
Really?
Great!

20:27.701 --> 20:30.067
Hold on. I said I was thinking
about it-- just thinking.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.234
( <i>groaning</i> )
( <i>groaning</i> )

20:31.267 --> 20:32.834
I mean, you know,
I was trying to weigh

20:32.868 --> 20:34.200
what's good about being a waiter

20:34.234 --> 20:36.067
against what's good
about being a cab driver.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.234
You know, I, um...

20:37.267 --> 20:38.767
I do make
a lot more bread here.

20:38.801 --> 20:39.801
Oh...
Yeah.

20:39.834 --> 20:41.200
But on the other hand,

20:41.234 --> 20:43.634
being a cab driver,
I'm my own boss.

20:43.667 --> 20:45.734
I mean, nobody orders me around,
you know.

20:45.767 --> 20:47.868
Nobody goes like this to me.

20:47.901 --> 20:49.000
That's right.
Right.

20:49.033 --> 20:50.534
That's important.
Self-respect,
you know.

20:50.567 --> 20:51.667
However, on the other hand

20:51.701 --> 20:55.367
being a waiter,
nobody goes like this to me.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.834
Oh, yeah, but
that's one in
a million.

20:56.868 --> 20:58.000
Big deal.
One time, you know?

20:58.033 --> 20:59.400
Of course, as a cab driver,
I can...

20:59.434 --> 21:00.767
I don't have to
dress up like this.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.000
I mean, uh... I can wear what I
want, shave when I want.

21:03.033 --> 21:05.267
Yeah, you hate shaving.
Yeah...That's right.

21:05.300 --> 21:06.667
Besides, you
look pretty
fruity...

21:06.701 --> 21:09.100
Of course, the hours are really
much better here, you know.

21:09.133 --> 21:11.501
I get to go home at midnight,
and I sleep at night.

21:11.534 --> 21:13.000
( <i>all groaning</i> )

21:13.033 --> 21:15.400
But of course, you know, as a
cab driver, my time is my own.

21:15.434 --> 21:16.834
I mean, I feel like working,
I work.

21:16.868 --> 21:18.434
I don't feel like working,
I don't work.

21:18.467 --> 21:19.434
That's great.
That's right.

21:19.467 --> 21:21.267
Exactly why I took
the job...
You know something?

21:21.300 --> 21:24.000
I do get great
gourmet meals here free.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.534
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right, so...

21:25.567 --> 21:28.234
But you know, the great thing
about being a cab driver?

21:28.267 --> 21:29.234
You can be yourself.

21:29.267 --> 21:31.434
I mean, you don't have
to smile at everybody.

21:31.467 --> 21:33.167
All they get
is the back of my head.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.234
What I do with my face
is my own business.

21:35.267 --> 21:37.234
( <i>all talking at once</i> )

21:37.267 --> 21:38.634
So, you see what I mean?

21:38.667 --> 21:40.501
I mean, both have
their advantages,

21:40.534 --> 21:42.634
both have
their disadvantages.

21:42.667 --> 21:44.033
See what I mean?

21:44.067 --> 21:47.367
Yeah, but, Alex, you know,
you're forgetting one thing.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.434
What's that?

21:48.467 --> 21:49.534
Friends.

21:49.567 --> 21:50.701
Oh.

21:50.734 --> 21:52.100
Yes.

21:52.133 --> 21:53.467
You're right, Bobby.

21:53.501 --> 21:57.067
I've made wonderful friends
here at the restaurant.

21:57.100 --> 21:58.467
( <i>mocking laughter</i> )
Joker!

21:58.501 --> 22:02.000
You see, so I say to myself,
what's it going to be?

22:02.033 --> 22:05.934
Waiter...

22:05.968 --> 22:07.300
cab driver.

22:07.334 --> 22:09.501
Waiter...

22:09.534 --> 22:11.501
cab driver...

22:11.534 --> 22:14.901
Alex, thank you.
Everything was excellent.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.000
This is for you.

22:17.033 --> 22:19.634
Wow! A $20 tip.

22:26.367 --> 22:28.801
This is very depressing.

22:30.133 --> 22:32.534
It's okay, Alex.
We understand.

22:32.567 --> 22:34.367
No, because I just decided.

22:34.400 --> 22:35.701
I'm a cab driver.

22:35.734 --> 22:37.734
( <i>cheering, laughing</i> )

22:43.667 --> 22:44.968
BOBBY:
Cabby Alex!

22:45.000 --> 22:47.133
They love the appetizer.

22:56.234 --> 22:57.934
LOUIE ( <i>over dispatch</i> ):
Just remember, Alex.

22:57.968 --> 22:59.934
This is your first night back.

22:59.968 --> 23:02.834
Don't pick up anybody
who looks suspicious.

23:02.868 --> 23:05.100
Now, listen, Louie, it's
not going to work that way.

23:05.133 --> 23:06.901
I'm going to drive the
way I always drive.

23:06.934 --> 23:08.968
Anybody who flags me,
I'm going to pick them up.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.601
Anywhere they want
to go, that's fine.

23:10.634 --> 23:13.000
I mean, I'm going to go crazy
if I spend my life

23:13.033 --> 23:15.400
trying to figure out who's safe,
who isn't safe.

23:15.434 --> 23:17.033
Look, it's a dangerous business.

23:17.067 --> 23:18.901
I'll just have to live
with it, okay?

23:18.934 --> 23:20.300
Okay.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.000
Sorry, off duty.

23:32.901 --> 23:34.501
Aw, what the heck.

23:36.434 --> 23:38.701
Might as well take a chance.

23:59.834 --> 24:02.567
