Heavenly Father,
Your power brings us to earth.

01:41.720 --> 01:43.200
It gives us life.

01:45.680 --> 01:49.400
Your providence guides us
and by Your command, we return to dust.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.360
Those who die still live in Your presence.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.680
Their lives do not end.

02:01.760 --> 02:05.640
In company with Christ,
those who died, live on.

02:05.720 --> 02:08.160
May they rejoice in Your kingdom.

02:09.760 --> 02:14.600
Where sorrow is unknown and joy prevails.

02:14.680 --> 02:16.920
Today, we ask You to take pity

02:17.000 --> 02:22.240
on the souls of our departed brothers,
Rinaldo and Orlando Albizzi.

02:23.960 --> 02:28.440
So cruelly torn from this world
by the swords of sinners.

02:33.160 --> 02:37.560
May You grant Rinaldo and Orlando mercy.

03:10.520 --> 03:14.000
The Signoria must move
to fill Rinaldo's seat.

03:14.080 --> 03:18.640
-Guadagni, his corpse is barely cold.
-These things can't wait. Forgive me.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.080
The nobles are restless.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.400
We must find a replacement
as soon as possible.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.880
-Very well.
-Someone who's sympathetic to the nobles,

03:24.960 --> 03:28.560
but also amenable to you and your family.

03:29.640 --> 03:33.640
You should know,
Andrea Pazzi is petitioning for the seat.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.120
Of course he is.

03:35.200 --> 03:38.840
Well, there are many in the Signoria
who view him as a fine candidate.

03:38.920 --> 03:41.920
They may well, but not many of the Medici
share their view.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Would he be such a bad choice?

03:44.080 --> 03:47.080
You have Florence
in the palm of your hand.

03:47.160 --> 03:51.320
-The Pazzi are not threat to you.
-There are always threats.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.520
Enemies.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.840
I... I choose to eat
with my back to the wall.

04:01.080 --> 04:04.120
Ah, Messer Medici.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.320
May I count on your support?

04:06.400 --> 04:08.200
Are you sure
you're up to such a challenge?

04:08.280 --> 04:12.120
Will you do it?
How hard can it be?

04:16.600 --> 04:18.520
Let me take the seat
in the Restricted council.

04:19.840 --> 04:21.640
If I'm to take over the bank one day,

04:21.720 --> 04:25.040
then it's time I got more
practical experience in the Signoria.

04:25.120 --> 04:29.480
On my own merit.
And not just as an observer at your elbow.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.040
-Piero, you know I think you capable
-Then say yes.

04:32.120 --> 04:33.120
I cannot.

04:33.200 --> 04:36.120
If I was to put your name forward,
it would be too obvious.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.520
People would know
I was working from behind the scenes.

04:41.600 --> 04:45.240
You can deliver the message
to my chosen candidate.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.720
What am I, a messenger?

04:58.720 --> 05:01.120
There are so few people I can trust, son.

05:02.720 --> 05:03.800
Do me this favor.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.760
I promise you your time will come.

05:10.840 --> 05:12.880
This is a chance for you
to prove yourself,

05:12.960 --> 05:15.080
but he wouldn't even give you that.

05:15.160 --> 05:18.240
-Father has his reasons.
-He's giving Albizzi's seat to an idiot.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.200
It's a chess move. Nothing more.

05:20.280 --> 05:23.280
Your father would rather have
a puppet he can manipulate

05:23.360 --> 05:27.080
than a man who knows his own mind.
And still you value his judgment?

05:27.160 --> 05:31.480
Olive oil!
Offering finest olives in Florence!

05:33.000 --> 05:34.480
...olive oil here.

05:34.560 --> 05:37.600
-Mastro Bredani...
-Messer Medici.

05:37.680 --> 05:38.680
Madonna.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.200
My father wishes to know
if we can count on your loyalty.

05:41.280 --> 05:45.360
Well, of course. I am his loyal servant.
What is it I can do for you?

05:57.360 --> 06:00.920
Me? A member of the Signoria?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.680
If you would do my father the honor.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.000
Who would look amongst the market stalls
for a candidate?

06:08.080 --> 06:11.440
Only Cosimo de' Medici,
a true man of the people.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.200
Wait, wait!

06:16.600 --> 06:21.560
My humble gift to your father.
It's my best oil. Take it.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.600
Take it to Messer Medici. Take it.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.600
I'll let him know
you are pleased to accept.

06:25.680 --> 06:26.920
Thank you.

06:46.800 --> 06:51.960
Now his body's buried,
you must put Rinaldo from your mind.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.760
You should have seen his eyes.

06:56.320 --> 07:00.720
No life left in them,
yet pain of his death remained.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.840
You must not torture yourself.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.360
The only torture is uncertainty.

07:07.600 --> 07:12.240
Forget Rinaldo's words.
I have to know, Marco.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.240
I have to know if he killed my father.

07:19.640 --> 07:23.640
Maybe it is time to accept.
You will never have the answer you seek.

07:23.720 --> 07:26.120
But it does not mean
you cannot know peace.

07:26.200 --> 07:30.160
How can I know peace with this dagger
of uncertainty in my side?

07:31.160 --> 07:34.400
Every day, it twists a little deeper.
I must know for sure.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.040
What if the truth only brought you pain?

07:50.240 --> 07:51.240
You know something.

07:54.880 --> 07:57.760
Whatever it is, you must tell me.

08:00.920 --> 08:01.920
Tell me.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.480
I command you!

08:07.640 --> 08:09.600
The dagger used to kill Tancredi,

08:09.680 --> 08:13.520
the apothecary, it was here,
in this house.

08:13.600 --> 08:18.200
-It still is. It was won in a card game.
-By whom?

08:20.520 --> 08:23.200
You're telling me
my father's killer is here?

08:23.280 --> 08:25.600
-In my home?
-I cannot say that.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.080
I can only speak of what I know
about the dagger.

08:29.160 --> 08:32.000
Then speak! Who does it belong to?

08:46.200 --> 08:49.800
-This has already been settled.
-Brother, is this yours?

08:50.880 --> 08:52.960
Yes. Where did you get it?

08:58.640 --> 09:00.240
What's this all about?

09:01.640 --> 09:06.000
God knows Father could be a difficult man,
but to do something as monstrous as this?

09:08.640 --> 09:11.880
What exactly is it that you accuse me of?

09:13.760 --> 09:16.280
Did you really love that Rosa girl
more than your own father?

09:30.040 --> 09:31.240
You think that I killed him?

09:36.280 --> 09:38.320
Was it because he refused
to let you marry her?

09:40.440 --> 09:43.960
-Are you out of your mind?
-Tell him where you found this, Marco.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.960
It was in the back of the man
who sold the poison

09:47.040 --> 09:48.600
used to kill your father.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.440
Cosimo!

09:50.520 --> 09:54.480
I have no idea how that dagger got there.

09:54.560 --> 09:58.080
But you know that I could not do this.

10:02.520 --> 10:03.680
You know!

10:05.520 --> 10:07.960
Ugo, talk some sense into my brother!

10:09.280 --> 10:12.680
Cosimo, your brother loved your father.
He would never do such a thing.

10:12.760 --> 10:15.200
You have no idea
what my brother is capable of.

10:15.280 --> 10:18.160
Cosimo, I, I've stood by you.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.760
Spoke up for you when no one else would.

10:21.840 --> 10:26.360
Spent my whole life in your shadow,
always second best in Father's eyes.

10:28.520 --> 10:32.360
And never once
that I complained or blamed you.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.120
And yet now, you accuse me of this?

10:39.960 --> 10:40.960
Come with us.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.040
Where?

10:43.120 --> 10:45.800
Your rooms,
where you will remain under guard.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.480
Are you serious?

11:00.040 --> 11:02.520
-You gave him that dagger, didn't you?
-Yes.

11:02.600 --> 11:05.520
With me out of the way,
my brother will rely on you.

11:08.320 --> 11:12.240
That's what you want. Isn't it, Marco?
That is what you've always wanted.

11:12.320 --> 11:15.080
To take my place in Cosimo's affections.

11:16.520 --> 11:17.800
What is it, uncle?

11:17.880 --> 11:21.000
Marco has manipulated events
to make me look responsible

11:21.080 --> 11:22.120
for my own father's murder.

11:22.200 --> 11:25.240
Murder? This can't be true.

11:25.320 --> 11:29.680
Anyone could have taken that dagger
from my saddles and killed Tancredi!

11:29.760 --> 11:31.160
Anyone, Cosimo!

11:33.160 --> 11:36.480
Someone who wanted to divert attention
from their own guilt perhaps?

11:36.560 --> 11:37.560
Someone like you!

11:37.640 --> 11:39.440
- No, please! Please stop it! Stop this!
- Guards!

11:39.520 --> 11:40.640
Remove his weapons.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.680
My brother is to be confined
to his chamber!

11:42.760 --> 11:45.080
No one is to see him.

12:22.960 --> 12:23.960
This is ridiculous.

12:25.080 --> 12:28.120
-Lorenzo could not have murdered Giovanni.
-Lucrezia, please.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.160
-This is difficult for us to believe.
-Then why believe it?

12:31.240 --> 12:33.920
You have no idea
of what my brother is capable of.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.600
-I know he's not capable of murder!
-All men are capable of murder!

12:40.440 --> 12:42.160
Given the right circumstances.

12:46.560 --> 12:50.240
Now let me be clear,
we do not speak of this again

12:50.320 --> 12:52.240
and this information
does not leave this house.

12:59.600 --> 13:00.600
You Holiness.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.720
My apologies.

13:03.800 --> 13:07.080
If we'd known you were joining us,
we would have waited.

13:15.760 --> 13:18.560
I stayed later than I intended
at the Basilica.

13:20.880 --> 13:23.360
Praying with Madonna Albizzi.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.960
I cannot imagine the pain she must feel,

13:41.600 --> 13:44.720
losing her husband
and her beloved son.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.120
This is a tragic day
for all those involved.

13:50.280 --> 13:55.240
But God will surely punish
the unrepentant sinners responsible.

14:26.440 --> 14:30.000
Ah, Signor Pazzi.
Good to see you here today.

14:30.080 --> 14:32.000
Likewise, Signor Guadagni.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.200
Though I wonder
what the olive oil merchant

14:34.280 --> 14:36.480
is doing in the Signoria?

14:36.560 --> 14:39.240
Perhaps he's mistaken this
for a marketplace.

14:39.320 --> 14:40.320
Hm.

14:45.880 --> 14:46.880
Messer Medici.

14:56.440 --> 14:58.240
What's he doing here?

14:58.320 --> 15:00.120
My father promised
he would send you a candidate.

15:01.520 --> 15:04.960
-Has your father gone mad?
-I'm sure he knows what he's doing.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.680
- Gentlemen!

15:08.760 --> 15:11.880
Please! Please, take your seats.

15:11.960 --> 15:15.640
While we are all still grieving
the loss of Rinaldo Albizzi,

15:15.720 --> 15:17.960
we can wait no longer.

15:18.040 --> 15:22.840
It is time a new member of the Signoria
is elected to take his seat.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.440
The successful candidate is...

16:11.000 --> 16:13.840
- Mastro Bredani!

16:13.920 --> 16:17.200
Yes! Yes! Yes!

16:18.240 --> 16:20.400
Thank you. Thank you.

16:20.480 --> 16:24.400
Who will join me for a drink to celebrate
my new position?

16:43.040 --> 16:45.480
-They let you in?
-No. I know where the keys are hidden.

16:45.560 --> 16:47.240
-You shouldn't be here.
-Neither should you.

16:49.240 --> 16:52.120
If I could just get Cosimo
to listen to reason.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.880
-You mustn't interfere, Lucrezia.
-Then I should do nothing?

16:54.960 --> 16:57.960
Marco has become
more Cosimo's brother than I am.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.160
He believes every word that he says.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.760
There is nothing that you can do.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.600
We must find proof
of Lorenzo's innocence.

17:10.680 --> 17:14.240
-I've spoken with Lorenzo and--
-You went against my father's orders?

17:14.320 --> 17:17.920
You know Lorenzo.
You know he could never do this.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.600
I trust my father's judgment.

17:22.560 --> 17:26.760
Even when he has a common olive oil
merchant elected to the Signoria?

17:28.000 --> 17:31.600
-Your father's judgment is wrong!
-Do not disobey him again.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.520
And I trust you will not disobey me.

17:42.320 --> 17:45.880
That concludes the matter
of the granary tax.

17:45.960 --> 17:49.040
Now we move on to outstanding matters.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.400
The Albizzi were declared traitors,

17:51.480 --> 17:55.760
so the Signoria
must seize their land and possession.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.240
Their deaths make no difference.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.120
Their deaths make no difference.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.720
Their deaths make no difference.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.000
You don't find that a little heartless?

18:13.800 --> 18:16.400
A mother has lost her husband and son.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.520
Would you steal
Madonna Albizzi's home from her?

18:22.160 --> 18:23.160
Take her money?

18:25.560 --> 18:28.440
The golden leaf from the frames
of her family portraits?

18:28.520 --> 18:31.040
We must think of the good of Florence.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.400
Surely,

18:34.680 --> 18:36.520
not of the individual.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.400
If her husband was a traitor,
then all that was his,

18:39.480 --> 18:41.200
rightfully belongs to the Republic.

18:41.280 --> 18:44.920
And besides, Messer Medici, it is the law.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.080
I am well aware of the law.

18:50.320 --> 18:54.400
You would deprive this innocent woman
of the home where she bore her son?

18:56.520 --> 19:00.200
Take away all that she has left
to remind her of her loved ones?

19:03.040 --> 19:04.320
Have you no mercy?

19:06.760 --> 19:07.760
None of you?

19:10.120 --> 19:12.440
I suppose, Messer Medici,

19:12.520 --> 19:17.360
if you so wish it,
an exception could be made.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.520
I do wish it.

19:21.360 --> 19:24.240
And I wish all of you
to share my compassion for this woman.

19:29.760 --> 19:32.880
Do I have your votes, gentlemen?

20:08.320 --> 20:09.320
Messer Medici?

20:11.080 --> 20:12.080
Madonna Albizzi.

20:14.920 --> 20:17.280
-Thank you.
-You have no need to thank me.

20:17.360 --> 20:21.040
I-- I only did
what any good Christian man would do.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.280
I know you and Rinaldo
were no longer close,

20:25.160 --> 20:26.600
but I won't forget this.

20:27.880 --> 20:29.080
May God bless you.

20:36.680 --> 20:41.680
How magnanimous of you
to show such kindness

20:41.760 --> 20:43.600
to the wife of your fiercest enemy.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.200
Your Holiness, please...

21:35.720 --> 21:37.560
I want to thank you
for blessing the Duomo.

21:37.640 --> 21:38.920
It may seem a small act,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.240
but it means a great deal
to the people of Florence

21:41.320 --> 21:45.120
that the completion of the Dome
will be a glory to God.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.800
And to the Medici.

21:49.440 --> 21:52.600
All our family's good deeds
are in humble service to God.

21:52.680 --> 21:56.600
Is that why the Medici seal
graces to many edifices your family

21:56.680 --> 22:00.360
constructs in its humble service to God?

22:01.480 --> 22:02.600
God sees all.

22:03.600 --> 22:07.160
He knows of the family's good work
with or without the seal, but we have...

22:08.960 --> 22:10.480
many enemies.

22:10.560 --> 22:13.800
The seals are not needed to remind God,
but to remind the people of Florence

22:13.880 --> 22:15.960
of the genuine piety of the Medici.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.000
Genuine piety indeed.

22:26.320 --> 22:27.720
God does see all.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.280
All our good deeds...

22:33.120 --> 22:34.600
and all our sins.

22:40.080 --> 22:42.600
We are all sinners
until we seek God's forgiveness.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.600
Then let us pray together.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.720
I'm a new member of the Signoria.

23:10.920 --> 23:17.360
♪ Questa fanciulla l'amor ♪

23:17.440 --> 23:23.440
♪ Fallami pia ♪

23:46.400 --> 23:47.840
Couldn't sleep?

23:50.240 --> 23:51.400
Perhaps I should run away.

23:53.960 --> 23:56.400
Nobody would even notice if I was gone.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.680
So what's keeping you awake?

24:11.320 --> 24:13.720
Worrying about a friend.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.200
What's there to worry about?

24:16.280 --> 24:18.560
He has the whole of Florence
at his command.

24:20.880 --> 24:21.880
You sound bitter.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.520
In Venice, I was his only distraction.

24:28.080 --> 24:31.720
Here he has Contessina,

24:31.800 --> 24:35.760
the Signoria and a million other things
more important than me.

24:37.880 --> 24:40.560
And he's made it quite clear
that there's no room left for...

24:42.040 --> 24:43.640
Oh, whatever it was we had.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.800
Perhaps he will move you
into another Medici house.

24:47.880 --> 24:53.160
-You could still have a good life.
-If Contessina will allow it?

24:54.720 --> 24:56.480
She'll probably just have me sold.

24:58.680 --> 25:02.520
-She is a merciful woman.
-Yes.

25:04.560 --> 25:07.280
But I suspect that her mercy ends...

25:08.680 --> 25:11.520
when it comes to her husband's whore.

25:15.320 --> 25:17.320
You shouldn't talk that way
about yourself.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.680
You're so much more than that.

26:05.240 --> 26:06.520
Cosimo?

26:08.080 --> 26:09.120
Is that you?

26:12.400 --> 26:16.560
Cosimo, I beg you,
can we just talk as brothers?

26:19.240 --> 26:21.280
I confess that, yes, I loved Rosa,

26:21.360 --> 26:23.720
just as you loved Bianca
so many years ago,

26:23.800 --> 26:27.960
but, but no quarrel
could ever have provoked me

26:28.040 --> 26:30.200
to raise a hand against Father.

26:30.280 --> 26:33.560
These troubles that you are having,

26:33.640 --> 26:36.800
they are clouding your judgment,
but you must put them aside

26:36.880 --> 26:39.160
and see only what is staring
you in the face.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.040
That I am innocent.

26:45.440 --> 26:48.240
That Marco Bello has done this to me.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.440
He's not worthy of your trust.

26:55.600 --> 26:56.760
Cosimo?

27:01.800 --> 27:02.840
Cosimo?

27:21.960 --> 27:23.360
Messer?

27:23.440 --> 27:26.720
Help a drunken fool
inside his home, please.

27:41.800 --> 27:42.760
Who's there?

28:29.960 --> 28:32.480
Please... Have mercy.

28:34.600 --> 28:35.520
No!

28:40.440 --> 28:43.480
Cosimo! Cosimo, what is it?

28:43.560 --> 28:45.120
I saw him.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.840
-Who did you see?
-Rinaldo.

28:49.520 --> 28:52.880
It was just a dream.
It's all right. I'm here.

28:55.120 --> 28:56.560
You blame yourself, don't you?

28:57.600 --> 28:59.320
But you must not.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.280
It was not your fault
that they were ambushed.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.800
You cannot carry this blame.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.840
I will stay with you.

29:17.920 --> 29:19.560
In case your nightmares return.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.680
No.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.320
I'll sleep better alone.

29:33.920 --> 29:34.920
As you wish.

30:03.240 --> 30:04.240
What's happened?

30:04.320 --> 30:08.040
I couldn't wake you before,
but Bredani was murdered.

30:08.120 --> 30:10.880
I tried to stop the voting,
but it was impossible.

30:10.960 --> 30:13.360
A slip with your mark
was given to Guadagni this morning,

30:13.440 --> 30:15.760
and I told him it couldn't be from you,
but it was too late.

30:19.320 --> 30:20.680
-Congratulations.
-Thank you very much.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.840
Madonna Albizzi.

30:31.960 --> 30:35.240
I came to offer our sincere condolences
for your loss.

30:37.360 --> 30:38.720
And why would you do that?

30:40.280 --> 30:42.160
Rinaldo's death has hit Cosimo hard.

30:43.240 --> 30:45.360
He blames himself
for sending them into exile.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.120
Hm.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.960
Well, perhaps
he has other reasons to blame himself.

30:51.760 --> 30:53.880
I'm sorry,
I don't understand your meaning.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.080
Do you really not know
what your own husband did?

31:05.600 --> 31:07.960
It was Cosimo
who ordered my family murdered.

31:11.080 --> 31:13.960
Grief plays tricks with us all.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.480
You are mistaken if you think
my husband had any part in this.

31:16.560 --> 31:18.800
This isn't grief speaking.

31:18.880 --> 31:22.000
Do you think I'm the only one
who believes it was him?

31:23.280 --> 31:25.280
A woman of your intelligence
should not delude herself.

31:26.560 --> 31:30.360
It was a great show,
sending Rinaldo and Ormanno into exile.

31:30.440 --> 31:34.800
So all Florence could see how merciful
the great Cosimo de' Medici is.

31:34.880 --> 31:37.040
But there is no mercy in his heart.

31:38.520 --> 31:39.720
It is made of stone.

31:45.680 --> 31:47.320
You have lost your family.

31:48.800 --> 31:52.160
I understand
why you wish to lash out against mine.

31:53.360 --> 31:54.680
You have no idea.

32:00.240 --> 32:02.360
Ormanno was my life.

32:03.480 --> 32:07.720
Without him I have no purpose,
no reason to go on.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.920
And it is Cosimo who did this!

32:20.120 --> 32:21.560
The only comfort I have...

32:24.720 --> 32:28.320
is that you now know
what sort of a monster you are married to.

32:37.640 --> 32:39.120
Show Madonna Medici out.

32:47.680 --> 32:51.200
-How dare you say such filth!
-It's what all the servants are saying.

32:51.280 --> 32:55.000
-Cosimo would never do such a thing.
-You think you know him better than I do?

32:55.080 --> 32:58.160
You're only saying that
because he's tossed you aside.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.040
Just as I told you he would.

33:00.120 --> 33:02.440
Your position in this house
is no longer safe.

33:02.520 --> 33:05.200
Speak against Messer Cosimo again
and you'll find yourself

33:05.280 --> 33:07.680
at the slave market in Genoa
before you know it!

33:07.760 --> 33:10.000
-What is the meaning of this?
-Madonna, I'm so sorry.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.880
Tell me what has been said
against my husband.

33:11.960 --> 33:13.760
No, it's nothing. It's just rumors.
Idle tongues.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.280
Tell me!

33:17.800 --> 33:21.480
People are saying...
he ordered the Albizzi's deaths.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.560
-Do not repeat these lies again.
-Of course not.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.000
Your Holiness.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.440
I have outstayed my welcome,

33:38.520 --> 33:41.680
but there is a room waiting for me
at Santa Maria Novella.

33:41.760 --> 33:43.880
Of course you haven't outstayed
your welcome.

33:43.960 --> 33:47.280
-We are honored to have you as our guest.
-But now it is time to go.

33:47.360 --> 33:50.440
At least remain until Cosimo returns.
He will be so sad to have missed you.

33:50.520 --> 33:53.000
I'm sure that your husband
will understand.

33:54.280 --> 33:56.160
Whatever you may have heard,
you must believe me

33:56.240 --> 33:59.120
when I say that there are many people
jealous of Cosimo's position.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.800
People who would tell
the most vicious lies

34:00.880 --> 34:03.480
if it meant that they might
destabilize this family.

34:11.840 --> 34:13.280
Yes, I'm confident.

34:13.360 --> 34:17.280
May I wish you congratulations
on your appointment, signore.

34:21.400 --> 34:23.760
No congratulations from you,
Messer Medici?

34:23.840 --> 34:25.720
Of course. Congratulations.

34:27.520 --> 34:30.520
I really hope
our families can work together.

34:30.600 --> 34:32.720
After all, we are both bankers.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.720
Both committed to the modern world
of commerce and trade.

34:35.720 --> 34:39.160
-It could be mutually beneficial.
-I'd like that very much.

34:39.240 --> 34:41.680
I always assumed the Medicis disliked
working with anyone

34:41.760 --> 34:43.160
and preferred people to work for them.

34:43.240 --> 34:44.840
We all like to be our own masters,

34:44.920 --> 34:47.720
-but I'm sure we can find a way.
-Indeed.

34:47.800 --> 34:52.160
I only hope one day, my family will
achieve the success of the great Medici.

34:53.160 --> 34:56.160
Do not underestimate
what it takes to scale such heights.

34:58.880 --> 35:00.720
I don't underestimate anyone.

35:17.720 --> 35:19.120
His Holiness has gone.

35:21.400 --> 35:24.000
Gone? Where?

35:24.080 --> 35:28.440
He claimed he'd be more comfortable
at Santa Maria Novella than here.

35:28.520 --> 35:32.000
But in truth, I suspect he did not wish
to be tainted by scandal.

35:33.560 --> 35:34.960
What scandal?

35:36.560 --> 35:39.080
There are rumors, Cosimo.

35:39.160 --> 35:41.400
Rumors you ordered the Albizzi deaths.

35:44.720 --> 35:47.720
Of course, I'm surprised
anyone would believe such lies.

36:06.240 --> 36:08.040
Cosimo, what are you doing here?

36:08.120 --> 36:10.880
I came to ensure your new home
is comfortable enough.

36:12.320 --> 36:14.680
It is sufficient.
I have no need for luxury.

36:14.760 --> 36:16.320
You haven't forgotten
what Matthew taught us

36:16.400 --> 36:18.680
about rich men
entering the kingdom of heaven?

36:18.760 --> 36:22.120
The Medicis may enjoy some luxury.

36:22.200 --> 36:23.920
But we enjoy God's favor too.

36:25.920 --> 36:29.000
The family's relationship with the church
has always been a strong one.

36:30.640 --> 36:33.200
-I hope that it will continue that way.
-Hm.

36:35.200 --> 36:38.280
Have you come here
out of concern for my wellbeing...

36:39.520 --> 36:42.240
or for where the church banks? Hm?

36:44.240 --> 36:47.800
Or perhaps it is not the bank
you fear for.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.160
Perhaps it is for your immortal soul?

36:53.440 --> 36:56.960
-I know you have heard rumors.
-I hear everything.

36:58.800 --> 37:02.440
There is a conspiracy against me,
led by the Pazzi.

37:02.520 --> 37:05.360
My downfall would do great things
for that family. I am--

37:07.760 --> 37:11.120
I implore you not to listen to their lies.

37:14.440 --> 37:18.080
Is it possible that in the shadow
of the Albizzi murders

37:19.480 --> 37:21.000
and your own father's death,

37:23.200 --> 37:24.720
you have become a little...

37:26.120 --> 37:27.120
sensitive?

37:28.760 --> 37:31.760
And now if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

38:02.040 --> 38:03.040
Out.

38:04.600 --> 38:06.040
Stefano.

38:13.760 --> 38:17.440
-Ugo, I need 20,000 florins.
-What for?

38:19.120 --> 38:20.160
I'm leaving Florence.

38:20.240 --> 38:22.200
Ugo, please, make him see sense.

38:22.280 --> 38:23.960
Help me persuade him.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.360
You must stay and defend yourself
from these false accusations.

38:26.440 --> 38:28.440
It's too late, Lucrezia.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.280
There is a change in Cosimo.

38:31.360 --> 38:34.920
A coldness.
And he has locked me out of his heart.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.800
Please, have the bill of exchange
drawn up while I prepare my escape.

38:57.480 --> 39:00.000
-Where were you?
-With Pope Eugenio.

39:01.480 --> 39:02.520
Is everything well?

39:04.520 --> 39:05.560
Why wouldn't it be?

39:07.760 --> 39:10.600
Or did you really think
he'd believe these vicious rumors?

39:10.680 --> 39:13.000
Perhaps you believe them?

39:14.240 --> 39:15.320
What is it they say?

39:17.240 --> 39:20.200
Before you embark on a journey
of revenge, dig two graves.

39:20.280 --> 39:22.280
Do not presume to lecture me, woman.

39:23.600 --> 39:27.080
As we sit here,
conspirators are plotting our downfall.

39:27.160 --> 39:30.120
Does that justify murder?

39:30.200 --> 39:33.760
Alessandra Albizzi believes it was you
who ordered their deaths.

39:33.840 --> 39:35.720
Perhaps she was right, after all.

39:37.440 --> 39:38.600
Tell me, Cosimo.

39:39.760 --> 39:41.200
Is your soul lost?

39:42.720 --> 39:45.200
Was it you
who ordered the deaths of the Albizzi?

39:51.320 --> 39:52.840
Of course not.

39:56.520 --> 39:58.680
We had our differences.

39:58.760 --> 40:01.840
But to think that I could live
with that man's death on my conscience...

40:13.120 --> 40:15.880
Then you must not allow this situation
to get out of your control.

40:17.960 --> 40:20.480
The Pope cannot afford to be tainted
by association with such lies.

40:23.120 --> 40:25.080
You must ensure
we have his undivided loyalty.

40:28.200 --> 40:30.120
Contessina?

40:30.200 --> 40:32.720
Contessina, will you not eat?

40:32.800 --> 40:34.680
I've lost my appetite.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.560
There are rumors, Cosimo.

40:58.640 --> 41:02.360
Alessandra Albizzi believes
it was you who ordered their deaths.

41:02.440 --> 41:04.080
Perhaps it is your immortal soul?

41:04.160 --> 41:06.400
- ...dig two graves.

41:06.480 --> 41:07.600
...dig two graves.

41:36.080 --> 41:37.080
What are you doing?

41:38.200 --> 41:40.680
How dare you disobey my orders!

41:40.760 --> 41:42.480
I had no choice.

41:42.560 --> 41:45.880
I couldn't stand by and watch
an innocent man be locked up.

41:45.960 --> 41:49.120
-You don't know he's innocent.
-But I do believe he is.

41:50.960 --> 41:52.320
I cannot let you go.

41:52.400 --> 41:54.840
You must let me leave, Contessina.
He will not listen to reason.

41:54.920 --> 41:56.600
This family will break--

41:56.680 --> 41:57.680
What is this?

42:00.280 --> 42:01.600
Who released him without my authority?

42:03.160 --> 42:05.760
You both need to hear
what Ugo has told me.

42:22.200 --> 42:23.480
Ugo, what is this about?

42:24.640 --> 42:27.640
Something I should have told you,
both of you, long ago.

42:27.720 --> 42:28.720
What?

42:30.080 --> 42:31.080
It's about Rosa.

42:36.280 --> 42:40.040
I knew how much
you loved that girl, Lorenzo.

42:41.560 --> 42:42.560
Your father knew too.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.480
What of it?

42:46.560 --> 42:50.440
After your father refused
to allow Lorenzo to marry Rosa,

42:50.520 --> 42:52.800
he ordered me to get rid of her.

42:52.880 --> 42:56.200
Just as he got rid of Bianca
all those years ago.

42:59.680 --> 43:01.600
Get rid of her?

43:02.640 --> 43:03.640
How?

43:07.400 --> 43:10.160
You were in love with her.
Everyone could see that.

43:10.240 --> 43:14.320
But your father deemed her
an inappropriate match.

43:14.400 --> 43:18.680
I offered her money,
as your father instructed.

43:20.360 --> 43:24.120
But she refused. She said she had
something more valuable.

43:25.120 --> 43:29.240
Something that meant more to her
than all the money in the world.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.320
She was carrying your baby.

43:48.000 --> 43:52.760
-Rosa had my child?
-He insisted she leave.

43:52.840 --> 43:54.160
To protect you.

43:54.240 --> 43:57.440
Your father had me take her to a home

43:57.520 --> 44:01.160
or unmarried mothers, near Arezzo.

44:01.240 --> 44:02.560
She was frightened.

44:04.080 --> 44:08.400
But I told her it was for the best.
That she could rely on me.

44:11.760 --> 44:14.160
Why, Ugo, did you not say anything?

44:16.800 --> 44:20.560
Your, your father ordered me
to keep her whereabouts secret.

44:22.040 --> 44:25.480
The last time I went to see her
was a few weeks before the baby was due.

44:25.560 --> 44:27.520
The woman who ran the place
tried to stop me.

44:27.600 --> 44:32.200
She, she said she'd left.
But I knew she was lying.

44:32.280 --> 44:34.760
I found her in her room.

44:34.840 --> 44:38.280
Both she and the baby were dead.

45:08.600 --> 45:11.200
This does nothing to relieve
the burden of guilt on my brother.

45:11.280 --> 45:13.240
But this does.

45:16.840 --> 45:18.920
I found it in Marco Bello's saddlebag.

45:20.600 --> 45:21.600
What is it?

45:23.000 --> 45:25.920
A bill of sale. For hemlock.

45:38.440 --> 45:40.360
Summon Marco Bello to my study.

45:51.520 --> 45:52.920
What is it?

46:02.480 --> 46:03.880
Tancredi's bill of sale.

46:05.200 --> 46:07.080
Who gave you this?

46:07.160 --> 46:09.440
The name of the buyer was torn off.

46:09.520 --> 46:12.120
And it was found in your saddlebags.

46:13.120 --> 46:16.120
You could have easily stolen
my brother's dagger from his chambers.

46:16.200 --> 46:18.000
You can't think I killed your father?

46:19.280 --> 46:21.840
You accuse me with evidence
far less conclusive.

46:21.920 --> 46:25.480
I was the one who demanded
Tancredi surrender this. Remember?

46:25.560 --> 46:26.640
So you said.

46:26.720 --> 46:31.520
After you murdered the surgeon
who conducted our father's autopsy.

46:31.600 --> 46:35.960
-What possible motive could I have?
-You didn't need a motive.

46:36.040 --> 46:38.320
All you needed was to be paid.

46:38.400 --> 46:39.680
Who was it, Albizzi?

46:42.280 --> 46:46.120
You know I have been a loyal friend
and servant to you, Cosimo.

46:46.200 --> 46:49.320
Loyal? Is it loyal to accuse my brother?

46:50.360 --> 46:52.840
Was it loyal to sleep with Maddalena?

46:54.520 --> 46:56.240
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

46:59.360 --> 47:02.520
There's no sum of money in the world
large enough

47:02.600 --> 47:04.840
to make me raise a hand
against this family.

47:05.920 --> 47:08.920
Your money has given you
enormous power, Cosimo.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.560
But I wonder,
do you understand the price you've paid?

47:21.360 --> 47:24.800
You expect us
to just let you walk out of here?

47:41.400 --> 47:45.560
If you believe
that I killed your father, then kill me.

47:45.640 --> 47:48.400
-Go ahead.
-Do it, Cosimo.

47:51.720 --> 47:53.080
Do it.

47:55.160 --> 47:58.720
I don't fear death. Death is easy.

47:59.880 --> 48:01.320
Do it.

48:01.400 --> 48:02.760
Do it!

48:26.120 --> 48:27.520
--I'll call the guards.

48:28.600 --> 48:29.920
No.

48:31.040 --> 48:32.040
Let him go.

48:34.120 --> 48:35.120
What?

48:37.680 --> 48:38.960
Let him go.
