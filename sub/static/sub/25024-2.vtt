00:46.171 --> 00:49.549
-[sniffs] Mm!
-[metal clattering]

00:52.510 --> 00:54.429
Smells delicious.

00:54.512 --> 00:56.222
-Hey! Who's out there?
-[gasps]

00:56.306 --> 00:57.640
Oh! Oh!

00:58.975 --> 01:02.353
-Let me in, let me in!
-Get your own Dumpster!

01:02.437 --> 01:05.272
 -[whimpering]
-Uh-uh. No room.

01:05.355 --> 01:06.316
Ah!

01:07.442 --> 01:08.860
-[gnomes chattering]
-[screams]

01:12.030 --> 01:12.906
Oh!

01:12.989 --> 01:17.285
[man] Jason, good boy! Come on home!
Come home, Jason!

01:17.368 --> 01:18.203
[line ringing]

01:18.286 --> 01:20.246
 -[rat squeaking]
-[both scream]

01:20.330 --> 01:22.457
-Mm!
-What are you doing out and about

01:22.540 --> 01:24.417
-this close to sunrise?
-Oh.

01:24.501 --> 01:27.670
You expect me to stay put
in this dirty old shack?

01:27.754 --> 01:29.297
I'm a proper lady.

01:29.380 --> 01:30.590
[rat squeaks]

01:31.466 --> 01:34.928
Apologies if these temporary
accommodations don't meet your standards,

01:35.011 --> 01:37.889
but there's only so many places
one can hide.

01:37.972 --> 01:41.059
If you prefer, there's a vacant,
old port-o-john on Third and Main.

01:41.434 --> 01:45.897
-[glass shatters]
-Oh, I'll take the rust wagon.

01:45.980 --> 01:49.567
Just got tonight's final tally.
Every troll accounted for, except for one.

01:49.651 --> 01:52.737
-Which one's Glug?
-Oh, you know Glug.

01:52.821 --> 01:56.199
She's hairy, green, always in a tub.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.951
-[grunts]
-Right.

01:58.034 --> 02:00.954
Well, she's missing,
and that's kinda a big problem.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.997
Not to worry, Master Jim. [grunts]

02:04.249 --> 02:05.250
Oh!

02:05.333 --> 02:08.711
As long as she doesn't stir up
any trouble, we shall locate her before--

02:08.794 --> 02:11.005
[woman on TV]
Trouble is brewing in Arcadia.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.675
A recent crime wave
is terrorizing our city.

02:13.758 --> 02:17.887
Vandalism, break-ins,
trespassers in the night, missing pets...

02:17.971 --> 02:21.808
As your re-elected councilwoman,
I say no more!

02:21.891 --> 02:25.562
I am hereby stepping up
police presence across Arcadia.

02:25.645 --> 02:29.607
To those responsible for these crimes,
the law is coming.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.442
We will hunt you down.

02:31.526 --> 02:32.402
-[gasps]
-Uh...

02:32.986 --> 02:34.863
[Usurna] What are you babbling on about?

02:34.946 --> 02:40.577
-You look like you've seen a gruesome.
-It spoke. It was her.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.120
The Pale Lady!

02:42.203 --> 02:47.458
Oh, please, that ridiculous relic?
This ruse may sway the Underlord--

02:47.542 --> 02:51.337
This time, it is real.
You do not understand.

02:51.421 --> 02:55.592
She reached out. I felt her.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.594
She is nothing but a foolish legend.

02:57.677 --> 03:01.264
-Quiet! She might hear you.
-She is not here.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.808
She has no power over me.

03:03.892 --> 03:07.645
-I'm so tired of hearing about Mor--
-Don't! Don't say it.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.939
Say what? Morgana.

03:10.356 --> 03:13.526
Morgana, Morgana, Morgana!

03:14.152 --> 03:15.862
[Morgana] Call to me.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.238
[gasps]

03:17.322 --> 03:20.283
[Morgana] Call to me, and it is yours.

03:20.366 --> 03:21.743
This can't...

03:23.161 --> 03:25.079
[Dictatious] What are you doing?

03:25.163 --> 03:27.332
-You can't--
-Gunmar must not know of this.

03:27.415 --> 03:30.168
Whatever this is,
nothing good can come of it.

03:30.251 --> 03:33.671
But it's a relic. Ancient, revered...

03:33.755 --> 03:35.340
And now, lost to the ages.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.927
[Dictatious gasps] Uh-oh.

03:40.094 --> 03:44.682
[Gunmar] Dictatious! Where is my advisor?

03:44.766 --> 03:47.518
You and I must keep Gunmar
on the path to victory.

03:47.602 --> 03:48.603
Our path.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.234
[Morgana] Call to me.

03:55.276 --> 03:56.152
[sniffs]

03:56.236 --> 03:59.364
"See you soon, pookie.
Can't wait for lasers."

03:59.447 --> 04:01.366
Kissy face, thumbs up, explosion GIF.

04:01.449 --> 04:02.575
[phone dings]

04:02.659 --> 04:05.870
Rocket ship, smiley cake?

04:06.454 --> 04:08.873
-Is that good?
-Huh? What good?

04:08.957 --> 04:12.293
Oh. Oh, sorry.
Darci and I have a laser tag date tonight,

04:12.377 --> 04:15.296
and I'm hoping it's the perfect place
to share our first kiss.

04:15.380 --> 04:19.466
The lights are low, adrenaline is high,
lasers are everywhere.

04:20.635 --> 04:25.974
Humans strange. Must find Glug. [sniffing]

04:26.057 --> 04:27.016
Oh! [growls]

04:30.895 --> 04:31.938
[cat screeches]

04:38.820 --> 04:40.571
-Glug's tub.
-Hm.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.657
Jim and the others
haven't seen her either.

04:42.740 --> 04:46.869
-What did she do, disappear? [chuckles]
-Mm-mm. Trolls can't do that.

04:51.666 --> 04:55.336
-What do you want?
-Uh, we ain't quite open yet.

04:55.420 --> 04:59.549
-Glug missing.
-I told you, she has been acting strange.

04:59.632 --> 05:03.052
-Uh, we don't know for sure.
-Know what?

05:03.136 --> 05:06.764
[Gut] Before she was a brewmaster,
Glug was quite the troublemaker.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.808
Off eating cats and stealing shiny things.

05:08.891 --> 05:13.855
[Rot] When we all got booted
from Trollmarket, she was real unhappy.

05:13.938 --> 05:17.567
[Gut] Said the party was over,
and she wanted to start it up again.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.069
Look! The crime spree!

05:20.153 --> 05:23.072
The police are looking for Glug!
Blinky needs to see this.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.158
-We gotta stop her before--
-[siren wailing]

05:25.241 --> 05:27.535
-Freeze! Hands in the air!
-[Rot] The fuzz!

05:28.119 --> 05:29.370
-Busted.
-Oh.

05:33.041 --> 05:36.419
-[indistinct police radio chatter]
-[officer] I can see you!

05:36.502 --> 05:38.212
-Oh, my gosh!
-[officer] Don't move!

05:38.296 --> 05:41.299
Oh, not again! Not again, not again!
Not again, not again!

05:41.382 --> 05:44.552
-[siren wailing]
-I can make it, I can make it...

05:45.011 --> 05:48.890
Stop! Hey, I remember you!
You're that kid who said he had no bones!

05:48.973 --> 05:51.893
-You seem to be running just fine now!
-[exhales deeply]

05:51.976 --> 05:55.855
No, I was just... [pants]
I was just... [groans]

05:55.938 --> 05:57.774
You were just coming with me.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.863
-Not good.
-[car door closes]

06:04.447 --> 06:08.534
[whimpering] This is bad.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.204
Ten years in juvie bad. Oh.

06:12.246 --> 06:13.915
Keep cool, man. Keep cool.

06:14.665 --> 06:15.500
Keep-- [shrieks]

06:16.667 --> 06:21.339
So, if it isn't the little man
I've been hearing so much about.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.132
-Who? Me?
-No.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.928
The other sweater-vest, mop-top,
dopey-eyed dimwit behind you.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.972
[grunts] What's your deal, son?

06:30.056 --> 06:32.642
My deal? [stammers] I don't know.

06:32.725 --> 06:36.187
I like magic and Go-Go Sushi and my--

06:36.270 --> 06:38.773
Didn't ask for your life story,
apple-cheeks.

06:38.856 --> 06:41.359
-What were you doing out there?
-Nothing, sir! Nothing!

06:41.442 --> 06:44.195
[scoffs] Sure. It's over, kid.
I know everything.

06:44.612 --> 06:47.698
-And I mean everything.
-Uh, I...

06:47.782 --> 06:50.368
No, you don't understand!
This is all a big mistake!

06:50.451 --> 06:53.079
You're right about that.
A great big mistake...

06:53.162 --> 06:54.747
that's dating my daughter!

06:55.248 --> 06:59.252
-Okay. Now, I'm lost.
-I'm Detective Scott.

06:59.836 --> 07:02.130
Oh, weird,
that's my girlfriend Darci's last name.

07:02.213 --> 07:03.673
[grunts] I'm her father!

07:04.382 --> 07:09.387
Ohhh! Ohhh. Ohhh. Oh.

07:09.470 --> 07:12.723
That's right, "Oh."
You stood her up tonight.

07:12.807 --> 07:16.060
-But that's 'cause you arrested me!
-Don't talk back to me, son!

07:16.144 --> 07:20.356
You know, Domzalski,
my sweet little girl really likes you.

07:20.440 --> 07:25.153
In fact, I've asked around.
Everybody likes you.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.696
But I don't.

07:26.779 --> 07:31.367
And now that I've seen your rap sheet,
I definitely don't like you.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.285
[chuckles]

07:32.368 --> 07:34.203
 -Reports of breaking into...
-[screech]

07:34.287 --> 07:38.624
...joy-riding in a stolen truck,
and now, picked up for trespassing.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.918
What do you gotta say
for yourself, Domzalski?

07:41.002 --> 07:44.255
Um... I'm an orphan. I never had a chance?

07:44.338 --> 07:45.673
-Don't play games with me!
-Ah!

07:45.756 --> 07:47.133
-What the...?
-[bell jingles]

07:47.216 --> 07:49.177
This belongs to the McVey cat.

07:49.260 --> 07:52.305
Been missing ever since
the break-in last week.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.599
Where'd you get this, kid?
What do you know?

07:54.682 --> 07:57.810
-Oh, please! I can explain!
-[man] We have a 2-11 in progress.

07:57.894 --> 08:01.272
Break-in at Sal's Motor Bikes.
All units respond.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.400
Detective Scott. I'm on my way.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.986
-[sighs]
-And you're coming with me.

08:07.695 --> 08:13.034
Oh, please, Mr. Scott! I can't go to jail!
I really don't do well in confined spaces!

08:13.117 --> 08:18.039
Hmm. I could let you off easy,
if you never see Darci again.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.041
Your call. Think about it.

08:23.085 --> 08:24.462
[tires screech]

08:25.463 --> 08:26.464
[radio chatter]

08:26.547 --> 08:30.051
This is a disaster!
Six new Vespas, all gone!

08:30.134 --> 08:32.345
 The GTs, the Primaveras...

08:32.428 --> 08:35.515
-Six, you said?
-Brand-new. Chrome so shiny,

08:35.597 --> 08:38.183
-you could see your reflection.
-Shiny? Stolen?

08:38.267 --> 08:40.186
[gasps] Oh, no! Glug!

08:40.937 --> 08:43.022
Come on, Jim! Pick up, pick up!

08:43.773 --> 08:46.901
Hey, I know him! He trashed
one of my scooters a while back!

08:48.861 --> 08:53.074
What a surprise. That little perp's crimes
just keep multiplying.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.118
Wonder what else
we're gonna find out tonight.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.497
[indistinct police radio chatter]

09:00.665 --> 09:01.499
[Scott sighs]

09:01.582 --> 09:04.585
So, were these track marks here before?

09:04.669 --> 09:08.381
-No, not that I'm aware.
-Think I know where your Vespas are.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.092
Dispatch, this is Detective Scott.

09:11.175 --> 09:14.428
-[cell phone ringing]
-[Jim] Hey, what's up, Tobes?

09:14.512 --> 09:17.014
Jim, help! I found a cat collar,
and Darci's dad,

09:17.098 --> 09:20.017
-he's trying to lock me away forever!
-Toby, slow down, man!

09:20.101 --> 09:22.895
No, listen! Glug's smashing windows,
stealing Vespas...

09:22.979 --> 09:26.190
She's in the sewers, man!
We gotta get to Glug before the police--

09:26.274 --> 09:30.027
"Before the police" what?
Who are you talking to? What is a "Glug"?

09:30.111 --> 09:32.780
A gang? What's Glug got to do
with this crime scene?

09:32.863 --> 09:33.948
[lock clicks]

09:34.031 --> 09:35.741
-[door handle clicks]
-Open the door!

09:35.825 --> 09:39.579
-I can't! I really can't! I'm sorry!
-[Jim] Toby, who's shouting?

09:39.662 --> 09:43.624
Open up or I'll...
Oh, no, you don't! [grunts]

09:43.708 --> 09:46.711
-[engine starting]
-Hey, open the door!

09:46.794 --> 09:48.129
[whimpering]

09:48.212 --> 09:49.547
[groans]

09:49.630 --> 09:53.175
-Hey!
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I'm an orphan!

09:53.259 --> 09:54.260
[Scott] You little...

09:54.343 --> 09:55.344
What about my Vespas?

09:55.428 --> 09:57.430
Dispatch, I have a runner.
Pursuing on foot.

09:57.513 --> 10:00.516
Suspect has a sweater vest
and a very punchable face.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.935
[siren wailing]

10:04.604 --> 10:05.855
[engine revving]

10:05.938 --> 10:06.939
What am I doing?

10:07.023 --> 10:09.817
[Jim] Toby! Tobes!
What is going on over there?

10:09.900 --> 10:12.695
I stole a cop car!
I'm in a high-speed chase!

10:13.279 --> 10:14.947
[tires squeaking]

10:15.740 --> 10:20.536
-What? Toby, get out of the car!
-Ugh! You're right! They can track me!

10:20.620 --> 10:23.539
Stupid Toby! Stupid, stupid!

10:24.332 --> 10:25.583
[grunts]

10:25.666 --> 10:27.585
[siren wailing]

10:32.006 --> 10:33.758
[indistinct police radio chatter]

10:37.470 --> 10:39.221
Only the guilty run, kid!

10:39.305 --> 10:43.225
You hear me? Only the guilty run!

10:43.309 --> 10:45.519
Toby, hello? Talk to me, Tobes!

10:45.603 --> 10:46.812
[coughs]

10:46.896 --> 10:49.357
Let's go. [sneezes]

10:49.440 --> 10:53.569
You sure? Maybe you should stay here.
You sound pretty sick.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.864
I'm fine! Glug can wait.
Let's just find Toby.

10:56.947 --> 10:59.116
-He couldn't have gotten far, right?
-[banging]

10:59.200 --> 11:00.201
What was that?

11:00.284 --> 11:01.452
[dog barking in distance]

11:05.790 --> 11:08.501
-[both screaming]
-Open the window, quick!

11:08.584 --> 11:09.627
Open the window!

11:11.295 --> 11:13.756
[grunting] Oh!

11:13.839 --> 11:16.300
I'm a wanted man, Jim! You gotta hide me!

11:16.384 --> 11:18.761
-[siren wailing]
-But you'd be harboring a fugitive!

11:18.844 --> 11:20.012
Toby, calm down.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.598
Darci's dad's a cop,
and he was tracking down Glug,

11:22.681 --> 11:25.059
who's been stealing jewelry and pets.

11:25.142 --> 11:30.773
She's the one who's behind the crimes.
But now, he thinks I did it. [sighs]

11:30.856 --> 11:33.859
And, in response, you steal a cop car?

11:34.652 --> 11:37.446
I panicked, Jim!
Doesn't matter. We gotta move.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.032
The cops are about to arrest
our missing troll.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.368
Oh, boy. Let me make a call.

11:42.451 --> 11:43.285
[line ringing]

11:43.369 --> 11:46.872
How else could the Gumm-Gumms
have gotten into the warehouse, huh?

11:46.956 --> 11:50.209
For all we know,
you ate the signs keeping 'em away!

11:50.292 --> 11:52.378
I didn't touch those things.

11:52.461 --> 11:56.632
Well, somebody stole those signs.
What, they vanished into thin air?

11:56.715 --> 11:58.592
-Compatriots, please.
-[clamoring]

11:58.676 --> 12:01.929
-Calm yourselves.
-[both arguing]

12:02.012 --> 12:03.222
[grunting]

12:03.305 --> 12:06.058
Master Jim? [gasps] What?

12:06.142 --> 12:09.728
-[arguing continues]
-I'm on my way. [grunts]

12:09.812 --> 12:13.315
-[banging, glass shattering]
-You two, figure it out!

12:13.774 --> 12:15.526
Huh. Let's go!

12:16.569 --> 12:18.237
Wait, let me grab my staff.

12:23.534 --> 12:24.577
Um...

12:25.161 --> 12:26.162
How did...?

12:27.830 --> 12:28.706
[gasps]

12:33.127 --> 12:34.837
[Jim] Claire, come on! We gotta move!

12:43.804 --> 12:45.347
[all scream]

12:45.431 --> 12:48.684
Gah! Come on!
You can't creep up like that!

12:48.767 --> 12:52.354
Apologies, but with your human
constabularies combing the sewers,

12:52.438 --> 12:54.773
discretion is absolutely paramount.

12:54.857 --> 12:59.612
Can't believe I'm going to jail
'cause a stupid tub troll is a klepto!

12:59.695 --> 13:00.905
Claire, any signs of Glug?

13:00.988 --> 13:04.450
What signs? What would I know about signs?

13:05.367 --> 13:08.787
[sniffs] Mm. Can't smell Glug.

13:09.872 --> 13:13.250
All right, we're splitting up.
We got a troll hunt, people.

13:15.503 --> 13:18.172
As I was saying, Aaarrrgghh,
I've asked Master Jim

13:18.255 --> 13:22.885
to resume training with me,
but he claims he's got it covered.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.179
-What do you suppose he meant by that?
-[sniffs]

13:25.262 --> 13:28.599
-Um...
-[growls, sniffs] Mm.

13:31.810 --> 13:37.566
Uh, walking around these sewers
isn't exactly helping my nausea. [coughs]

13:37.650 --> 13:41.237
-I feel like I'm running on empty.
-It feels like we all are.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.907
But, as long as Gunmar's got Trollmarket,
all we can do is try to survive

13:44.990 --> 13:46.742
and wait for our chance to--

13:46.825 --> 13:49.620
But I gotta survive this cold first.
[sneezes]

13:49.703 --> 13:50.996
-[sniffs]
-Claire, you know,

13:51.080 --> 13:54.834
if you're feeling that bad,
I-I can search for Glug by myself.

13:54.917 --> 13:58.796
-No, I'm fine. [coughs] I totally got--
-[rat squeaking]

13:58.879 --> 14:00.381
[screams]

14:00.464 --> 14:02.424
-[retches]
-[groans]

14:04.593 --> 14:10.516
Glug? If you can hear me,
I know what it's like to be a fugitive.

14:10.599 --> 14:14.937
We're both hardened criminals!
But you gotta turn yourself in!

14:15.854 --> 14:16.939
[footsteps departing]

14:17.022 --> 14:18.023
Glug?

14:19.191 --> 14:20.109
Hey, wait!

14:20.818 --> 14:22.778
[panting]

14:24.363 --> 14:26.907
[gasps] Whoa.

14:31.745 --> 14:34.456
[gasps] Whoa.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.003
[gasps] Oh, Glug.

14:39.086 --> 14:41.589
-What have you gotten yourself into?
-[metal clanging]

14:42.840 --> 14:44.258
Glug? [muffled gasp]

14:46.760 --> 14:47.970
[sighs]

14:48.053 --> 14:52.600
Everyone's out runnin' about,
and I get a little me time.

14:52.683 --> 14:55.060
-Glug!
-Why you in Glug tub?

14:55.144 --> 14:58.939
Oh, hey! I thought you was gone--
I-I mean, lost.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.983
Glug not lost.

15:01.066 --> 15:04.778
-But you were out on a wild rampage.
-Rampage?

15:04.862 --> 15:09.575
No, just gathering ingredients
for more glug, see?

15:09.658 --> 15:12.202
-Starting party again.
-Wait.

15:12.286 --> 15:15.956
So, you didn't do none
of them crimes around town?

15:16.040 --> 15:18.918
I gotta tell the Trollhunters. [sniffs]

15:19.001 --> 15:20.169
[Glug] Mm.

15:20.252 --> 15:23.213
After some fresh batch of glug, of course.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.591
[footsteps approaching]

15:26.342 --> 15:29.219
-[gasps, whimpers]
-[knuckles cracking]

15:30.137 --> 15:32.097
You said there'd be
no witnesses down here.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.683
Since when did kids
run around in the sewers?

15:34.767 --> 15:36.727
This whole podunk town's full of idiots.

15:36.810 --> 15:42.524
Wait, you-- The-The-- The burglaries
were done by actual burglars?

15:42.608 --> 15:47.279
-Wow, this one's a real Einstein.
-The Vespas, the jewelry...

15:47.363 --> 15:50.783
-But why take people's cats?
-What are you talking about?

15:50.866 --> 15:53.953
-We didn't steal any cats.
-[Toby] Well, then who--?

15:54.536 --> 15:58.123
-Oh, that part was Glug.
-[man on radio] All units report in.

15:59.708 --> 16:00.709
[man whimpers]

16:02.962 --> 16:04.213
[muffled grunting]

16:07.091 --> 16:07.925
[thuds]

16:08.509 --> 16:10.344
-Detective Scott here.
-[muffled grunts]

16:10.427 --> 16:12.262
[Scott] Somewhere
under Franklin Street.

16:13.013 --> 16:16.266
You! I never should've... Wait.

16:16.350 --> 16:19.478
-Why are you gagged?
-[clattering]

16:19.561 --> 16:22.856
Hey! Out where I can see you! Hands up!

16:22.940 --> 16:25.484
-Nice and slow.
-[grunts]

16:26.360 --> 16:29.279
-[groans] Ow. What are you doing?
-[Toby grunting]

16:30.322 --> 16:31.782
[Toby whimpers, grunts]

16:31.865 --> 16:33.784
Trying to get us out of this.

16:33.867 --> 16:36.495
I specialized in escape artistry
at magic camp.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.163
[grunting] Come on!

16:38.247 --> 16:40.916
[grunts, sighs]

16:41.000 --> 16:43.502
[sighs] What does my daughter see in you?

16:43.585 --> 16:47.423
Gone for five minutes, and you two
somehow lead a kid and a cop to us?

16:47.506 --> 16:49.341
This is not good. We gotta bail.

16:49.425 --> 16:52.845
Aw, you want a diaper?
Because you're being a real baby!

16:52.928 --> 16:54.221
I'm not a baby!

16:54.304 --> 16:57.683
Listen, however this plays out,
maybe I overreacted earlier.

16:57.766 --> 17:01.353
-Just... Darci's everything to me.
-She means everything to me, too.

17:01.437 --> 17:05.065
-Does this mean I can date your daughter?
-Don't push it.

17:05.148 --> 17:07.568
-[clanging]
-[woman] Hey, hey, wait.

17:07.651 --> 17:10.445
-What's that you got there?
-I found it on the kid.

17:10.529 --> 17:14.074
What is it? A toy?
Like a laser sword or some--?

17:14.157 --> 17:15.409
[groaning in slow-motion]

17:16.367 --> 17:18.287
-Oh, no.
-You knocked the cop out cold!

17:18.369 --> 17:20.204
Whoa, whoa! Look at that thing!

17:20.289 --> 17:23.666
[chuckles] No, don't look at it!
It's just a toy. He's totally right.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.586
How...? I can't even...

17:25.669 --> 17:27.880
It-It's flyin'! How's it flyin'?

17:27.963 --> 17:31.091
It's gotta be high-tech magnets,
or a drone, or...

17:31.175 --> 17:33.510
Whatever it is,
it's gotta be worth a fortune!

17:33.594 --> 17:35.846
[man] Detective Scott,
we're entering the sewers.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.723
-Come in.
-The cops. We gotta book it.

17:37.806 --> 17:40.684
Yeah, yeah. Leave the haul,
grab the flyin' rock.

17:40.768 --> 17:43.020
Hey, let's bring the kid.
Might need collateral.

17:43.103 --> 17:44.188
[yells]

17:44.271 --> 17:48.025
[muffled screaming]

17:49.193 --> 17:52.362
-Toby! They're taking him!
-[Scott] Wait, what...?

17:53.113 --> 17:57.201
-Mr. Scott! We gotta get him out of here.
-Can you get him to safety?

17:57.284 --> 18:00.621
-I'll go after Tobes.
-Think so. How you gonna catch 'em?

18:03.373 --> 18:04.291
[rat squeaking]

18:04.374 --> 18:09.838
A GTS 300 Super Sport.
Maxed to the nines.

18:12.591 --> 18:13.801
Oh, I'll catch 'em.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.344
[rat squeaking]

18:20.641 --> 18:21.892
[tires screeching]

18:21.975 --> 18:23.185
[muffled screaming]

18:23.268 --> 18:26.021
-Boss, we got company!
-Keep movin'! The heat's comin'!

18:36.323 --> 18:38.742
Holy-- Hey, get away from me!

18:46.625 --> 18:49.503
[Scott groans] Toby... hands off princess.

18:49.586 --> 18:52.339
Oh, just wait here.
I'll get some help, okay?

18:52.422 --> 18:56.260
-[siren wailing]
-Hey, down here! Officer down!

19:09.731 --> 19:15.279
What is going on?
I got freakin' Lancelot on me! [screams]

19:16.864 --> 19:18.323
[woman] See ya, freak show!

19:20.284 --> 19:21.827
[grunts] Aha!

19:22.578 --> 19:23.579
Magic!

19:24.413 --> 19:26.832
[woman shrieks]

19:26.915 --> 19:28.333
-Ha!
-[Jim] Toby!

19:29.585 --> 19:30.878
Jim, over here!

19:32.004 --> 19:35.799
-[gasps]
-Not one step further! You hear me?

19:35.883 --> 19:38.969
Okay, fine! Just don't hurt him!

19:39.052 --> 19:41.805
I don't know
what you Renaissance fair freaks are,

19:41.889 --> 19:44.975
but we're not goin' back to San Quentin,
you hear me?

19:45.058 --> 19:45.976
[rats squeaking]

19:48.854 --> 19:51.565
[grunting, growling]

19:51.648 --> 19:53.233
[indistinct chatter]

19:59.907 --> 20:01.158
[Blinky grunts]

20:01.742 --> 20:03.076
[growls]

20:03.160 --> 20:04.828
-[man] Run!
-[metal clanging]

20:04.912 --> 20:05.996
[woman screams]

20:06.079 --> 20:07.748
[man] Monsters! Save us!

20:07.831 --> 20:09.416
Boom. [imitates explosion]

20:09.499 --> 20:12.878
Last thing I remember,
the suspects had me detained,

20:12.961 --> 20:14.588
and then... black.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.965
-Somehow, I wound up here.
-[distant shouting]

20:17.049 --> 20:18.800
-What the--
-Those Renaissance people!

20:18.884 --> 20:21.303
-[Scott] It's the perps!
-[woman] I don't know! Ahh!

20:21.386 --> 20:24.973
-[man] Hide us! Get us away from them!
-[woman] There's monsters in there!

20:25.307 --> 20:27.851
-Take us to San Quentin, now!
-[lock clicking]

20:28.268 --> 20:30.479
-What's got them all spooked?
-[metal clanging]

20:30.562 --> 20:32.314
[Toby grunting]

20:32.397 --> 20:34.858
Hi, Mr. Detective Scott. [chuckles]

20:35.442 --> 20:39.154
It gives me great pride
to say the criminals have been caught,

20:39.238 --> 20:41.823
all thanks to Detective Scott,

20:41.907 --> 20:44.826
with the help of brave,
young Toby Domzalski.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.829
-Both heroes!
-[applause]

20:47.913 --> 20:51.625
[giggling]
My little Toby Pie did something.

20:51.708 --> 20:53.001
[blows nose]

20:53.085 --> 20:56.588
Hey, Mr. Detective Scott? Thanks
for not throwing me in jail forever.

20:56.672 --> 21:00.717
Least I can do.
Just stay away from my squad car.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.886
-[applause]
-[chuckles]

21:02.970 --> 21:04.805
Maybe you can date my daughter.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.515
-Ah!
-With a chaperone.

21:06.598 --> 21:07.724
[growls]

21:07.808 --> 21:12.354
[gasps, squeals]

21:12.437 --> 21:16.275
Toby! You're amazing! You did it!

21:16.900 --> 21:19.319
[Scott] Darci! Okay, that's enough.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.697
Well, uh, that's happening.

21:21.780 --> 21:26.201
Is it just me, or was taking down a few
human baddies tonight kinda refreshing?

21:26.285 --> 21:29.746
Yeah, when we're done with Gunmar,
we might have a future in crime fighting.

21:29.830 --> 21:34.001
-And... they're still going.
-[gags]

21:35.877 --> 21:38.255
[grunts] Where is it?

21:39.381 --> 21:40.215
[grunts]

21:41.174 --> 21:43.885
There must be something here! [grunts]

21:57.399 --> 21:58.900
[Morgana] Call to me.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.404
And the key to Eternal Night...

22:03.572 --> 22:05.949
it is yours.

22:07.492 --> 22:10.120
Morgana.
