Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Pits and Peaks"</font>

00:10.109 --> 00:12.743
See, this is why you put in all
that hard work during the week,

00:12.838 --> 00:14.234
to get to the end of the week.

00:14.322 --> 00:17.032
Or as I sometimes call it,
the "weekend."

00:17.126 --> 00:18.279
What do you guys call it?

00:18.421 --> 00:19.834
I call it the weekend.

00:19.977 --> 00:21.102
Shut up.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.516
No, Michael,
I think everyone calls it the weekend.

00:23.604 --> 00:24.933
I just said shut up.

00:25.021 --> 00:26.534
Now, shut the ♪♪♪♪ up.

00:26.621 --> 00:29.044
You're ruining my weekend
with all your jibber-jabber.

00:29.131 --> 00:30.991
Weekdays are
for jibber-jabber,

00:31.079 --> 00:34.415
weekends are for...
Wait, what are they for, Marquess?

00:34.532 --> 00:37.319
Uh... Rest and relaxation?

00:37.407 --> 00:39.991
Yeah, that's right.
Rest and relaxation.

00:40.079 --> 00:43.124
I love hearing you talk,
Marquess. It relaxes me.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.391
Put me in that
weekend state of mind.

00:45.671 --> 00:48.977
- Oopsie. Five-second rule.
- Hey, what the...

00:49.868 --> 00:51.381
Cannonball!

00:56.204 --> 00:58.775
Let's go around the table
and say our pits and peaks.

00:58.868 --> 01:00.728
All right, Pigeon,
let's start with you.

01:01.121 --> 01:03.104
Well, let me see.

01:03.191 --> 01:05.773
I would say
the peak of my day was,

01:05.861 --> 01:09.806
well, any moment before
being burned alive.

01:10.103 --> 01:12.431
And the pit of my day...

01:12.681 --> 01:16.655
I'm not a negative person, so,
these are always hard to think of,

01:16.743 --> 01:21.040
but I'd say it's a tie between forgetting
to record the opening round of the Masters

01:21.181 --> 01:23.165
and being burned alive!

01:23.662 --> 01:24.945
How about you, Yung?

01:25.181 --> 01:27.494
- Pit and peak.
- Sorry for interrupting,

01:27.657 --> 01:30.845
but I have finished my dinner.
May I please be excused?

01:31.021 --> 01:32.335
Um, sure.

01:32.423 --> 01:34.038
Can I offer anyone coffee?

01:34.126 --> 01:35.655
Oh. I would love a cup.

01:35.743 --> 01:38.109
I said "Can I" not "May I."
Burn.

01:38.197 --> 01:40.798
But can I please have a cup
of coffee in the living room?

01:41.893 --> 01:44.027
Hey, Deezy, you didn't wanna
join us for dinner?

01:44.123 --> 01:46.144
You said you didn't want me
to join you for dinner.

01:46.232 --> 01:47.273
Oh, that's right.

01:47.361 --> 01:49.335
Hey, what you got
on that computer?

01:49.423 --> 01:52.788
Oh, I'm just checking out the Nevada
State Treasurer's Office website.

01:52.876 --> 01:55.001
You know, seeing if there's
any unclaimed funds out there.

01:55.089 --> 01:57.702
You know, any money that has gone
missing in the mail or what have you.

01:57.790 --> 01:58.993
Every dollar counts.

01:59.081 --> 02:03.072
Hey, put my name in there too. Let's see if
I have anything in those unclaimed funds.

02:03.400 --> 02:06.538
Did you ever live at 17-4-9-7,
East Tuckey Avenue?

02:06.626 --> 02:09.616
- Oh, yeah.
- Then you got $1,981 coming to you

02:09.704 --> 02:11.014
from Western Savings and Loan.

02:11.103 --> 02:12.244
Oh, damn!

02:12.331 --> 02:13.814
See that, Mike?
I get you that money.

02:13.901 --> 02:16.714
Put it in Yung's name.
Her missing money is my money.

02:16.801 --> 02:19.543
How do you spell "Yung"?
No MSG, right?

02:20.629 --> 02:23.046
Hey, is that a race joke
because she's Asian?

02:23.134 --> 02:25.361
What? I was just...
I mean,

02:25.449 --> 02:27.921
I was just trying to connect, you know,
on a human level.

02:28.009 --> 02:30.734
I'm sorry. I just felt like
I don't belong and nobody likes me.

02:30.822 --> 02:32.234
So, I thought
I'd be the funny guy.

02:32.321 --> 02:33.618
Everybody likes the funny guy.

02:33.706 --> 02:36.265
You gotta know your role,
Deezy, Yung is the funny guy.

02:36.353 --> 02:37.694
Yung, say something funny.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.313
What do you mean?

02:39.923 --> 02:41.845
It's now what she says,
it's how she say it.

02:41.978 --> 02:43.604
Let's see if Marquess
is in there.

02:43.691 --> 02:45.095
Marquess,
what's your last name?

02:45.183 --> 02:48.290
Well, for starters,
"Marquess" isn't my first name.

02:48.378 --> 02:51.191
As I have said
on numerous occasions,

02:51.279 --> 02:52.662
my name is John Douglas.

02:52.771 --> 02:55.654
My title is
"Marquess of Queensberry."

02:55.868 --> 02:58.851
And because "Marquess"
sounds like "Marcus,"

02:58.939 --> 03:02.648
and because you are all
monstrously ignorant and lazy,

03:02.736 --> 03:03.900
you call me "Marquess."

03:03.988 --> 03:07.155
And because I don't give a shit
anymore, I respond.

03:07.243 --> 03:09.374
Nope, nothing in Nevada
for John Douglas.

03:09.462 --> 03:12.241
Well, uh, I lived in Scotland.
Can you search there?

03:12.329 --> 03:13.234
Mmm-hmm.

03:13.321 --> 03:14.618
Okay, here's a John Douglas.

03:14.706 --> 03:17.025
There's an unclaimed account in your
name at the Royal Bank of Scotland.

03:17.161 --> 03:19.257
Yes. That was my bank!

03:19.345 --> 03:21.116
I think I had
a small savings there.

03:21.204 --> 03:23.150
- Well, it's not small anymore.
- What?

03:23.238 --> 03:26.951
£3,420,000?

03:27.171 --> 03:29.048
That's almost $5 million.

03:30.220 --> 03:32.254
I'm telling you,
it's the way she says things.

03:32.341 --> 03:34.319
Oh, my God. I'm rich.

03:34.407 --> 03:37.782
I'm rich! Oh, I'm gonna
buy so many things.

03:37.954 --> 03:39.095
First thing?
Yep.

03:39.190 --> 03:41.538
First thing I'm gonna do
is get a brand new wardrobe.

03:41.626 --> 03:44.304
I mean, what is this
old-timey ♪♪♪♪?

03:44.391 --> 03:46.104
It's never gonna
come back in style.

03:46.191 --> 03:49.194
I look like I'm in a ♪♪♪♪
Jane Austen novel. Oh, my God.

03:49.282 --> 03:51.679
You know what else we're gonna get?
A new ♪♪♪♪ car.

03:51.767 --> 03:53.616
I am sick
of that shitty van.

03:53.704 --> 03:56.601
We look like a gang of child
molesters in that thing.

03:56.689 --> 04:00.398
Okay, Deezy,
how do I get my money?

04:00.486 --> 04:03.359
Huh. Normally, you just put in your
information and they send it to you,

04:03.447 --> 04:05.788
but this says, if it's been
unclaimed for more than ten years,

04:05.876 --> 04:08.210
-you have to physically go in to the bank.
- Oh!

04:08.313 --> 04:11.634
Then I guess I know where this
week's mystery takes place.

04:11.722 --> 04:13.595
Scotland, bitches!

04:13.712 --> 04:17.040
Oh, well... Uh...
What about this mystery?

04:17.128 --> 04:18.616
"Dear, Mike Tyson
Mystery Team,

04:18.704 --> 04:20.709
"the hospital where my wife
is on life support

04:20.798 --> 04:22.774
is threatening
to pull the plug on Friday.

04:22.861 --> 04:25.454
But I know she'll wake up.
We just need more time.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.954
Please come help.
Her life is in your hands."

04:30.074 --> 04:31.579
Hey, man,
we gotta go get you on <i> the</i>

04:31.688 --> 04:33.241
tonight Show with Johnny
Carson, man.

04:33.329 --> 04:34.771
You are just too funny.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.642
Okay, um,
I'll go ahead and order another

04:39.730 --> 04:42.261
- right now, just to save time.
- Thanks.

04:42.915 --> 04:46.984
Oh, really? So, you're just gonna
judge me the entire flight to Scotland?

04:47.072 --> 04:49.499
I'm sure that woman
will be fine.

04:49.609 --> 04:52.155
There things always have a way
of working themselves out.

04:52.243 --> 04:55.142
And I'm sorry,
but who are we to play God?

04:55.931 --> 04:59.174
Okay, you know what?
Judge away, just judge away.

04:59.261 --> 05:00.913
I'm gonna get my buzz on.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.726
I'm gonna watch
<i>My Best Friend's Wedding,</i>

05:02.814 --> 05:05.116
take a nap,
and then watch <i> Runaway Bride,</i>

05:05.204 --> 05:09.288
and you can sit there like Judge
Judy with your can of Sprite

05:09.376 --> 05:10.937
and your sourpuss
and be miserable.

05:11.025 --> 05:12.663
Because you know what, Yung?
You're miserable.

05:12.751 --> 05:16.424
And if money could buy happiness,
I would give you my $5 million.

05:16.511 --> 05:18.534
But it can't.
That's on you, Yung.

05:18.621 --> 05:21.337
That is on you.

05:25.421 --> 05:28.034
Oh, my God!
Is my screen not working?

05:28.160 --> 05:30.415
♪♪♪♪! Tittysucker!

05:30.661 --> 05:32.798
Yung, can we switch seats?

05:33.101 --> 05:35.614
We should go on a
Scotch-tasting while we're here.

05:35.701 --> 05:37.444
Go to one of those
old distilleries.

05:37.531 --> 05:38.884
Well, I'm only 18.

05:39.014 --> 05:40.784
I think
that's old enough here.

05:41.014 --> 05:43.028
You can get drunk
and lose your virginity

05:43.116 --> 05:45.036
to one of those
red-bearded sweaty

05:45.124 --> 05:46.692
Scotsmen they got
running around here.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.762
Ew! No way. Gross.

05:48.850 --> 05:51.249
Yung, now be honest.

05:51.451 --> 05:52.731
You're a lesbian, aren't you?

05:52.819 --> 05:54.264
It's none of your business.

05:54.351 --> 05:56.264
Okay? And I don't believe
in labels.

05:56.351 --> 05:57.664
Well, I do, sister.

05:57.788 --> 06:00.153
So what's your poison?
The penis or the vagina?

06:00.241 --> 06:03.340
Well, if anything,
I identify as pan.

06:03.428 --> 06:04.655
Wait, what?

06:04.743 --> 06:07.692
Mike, did you know this?
Did you know your daughter is pan?

06:07.780 --> 06:09.844
Like a pan?
Like a frying pan?

06:09.960 --> 06:12.354
Like her face
is like a frying pan?

06:12.441 --> 06:13.819
Yeah, of course I know that.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.428
When she was little I used to
call her "Frying Pan Fran."

06:16.533 --> 06:18.476
- You remember that, Yung?
- Yeah.

06:18.641 --> 06:20.554
Unreal.

06:20.641 --> 06:22.207
They won't give me my money.

06:22.295 --> 06:24.710
Wanna know why?
Because I'm deceased.

06:24.811 --> 06:26.465
No shit, Sherlock!

06:26.553 --> 06:28.704
So, we came all this way
for nothing?

06:28.834 --> 06:30.872
That's why you should
always call first.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.942
They said they can release
the money to a living heir.

06:34.030 --> 06:35.174
Well, do you have
a living heir?

06:35.261 --> 06:36.358
Evidently.

06:36.446 --> 06:38.450
Ian Douglas.
I think he would be

06:38.538 --> 06:41.731
my great-great-great-grandson,
or maybe one more "great."

06:41.819 --> 06:44.114
I don't know.
I'm just so ♪♪♪♪ mad.

06:44.264 --> 06:47.960
I have an address. Get this,
he lives in Glasgow.

06:48.048 --> 06:50.428
He works in a factory,

06:50.516 --> 06:54.444
a fish-processing factory.
Jesus.

06:54.541 --> 06:57.514
I am rolling over
in my own grave.

06:59.030 --> 07:01.356
Ian, it should be
very straightforward.

07:01.444 --> 07:02.668
Just a quick trip to the bank,

07:02.756 --> 07:06.020
and... I'm sorry, is there maybe
a scented candle we can light?

07:06.108 --> 07:10.294
Or a can of Febreze?
Just a quick, quick, quick spritz?

07:11.044 --> 07:12.814
So, you're
telling me we're kin?

07:12.901 --> 07:15.762
You're my great-great-great-
great-great-grandfather?

07:15.850 --> 07:18.314
And you want me to go with you
and sign some papers in a bank,

07:18.401 --> 07:19.676
and we are rich?

07:19.764 --> 07:22.084
No, no, we're not rich,

07:22.171 --> 07:24.176
I'm rich. Oh! Oh, my God!

07:24.264 --> 07:27.442
Okay, okay.
So, when do you get off work?

07:27.530 --> 07:31.152
Hmm? Again, it's just a quick zip
to the bank, zip in and zip out.

07:31.240 --> 07:34.559
Well, it could be a while.
I've got to process the rest of those...

07:34.647 --> 07:36.004
Unless you wanna
give me a hand?

07:36.091 --> 07:38.668
You just take a fish, and
first, you saw off the head.

07:38.756 --> 07:41.270
And then you grab the spine
and give it a yank.

07:41.358 --> 07:44.972
Sometimes, you gotta use your teeth,
you know, get the knob of the spine.

07:46.721 --> 07:49.174
Then you lay the carcass
back for rendering.

07:52.771 --> 07:54.068
Well, come on, then.

07:54.156 --> 07:57.056
These fishes aren't gonna
process themselves.

08:03.481 --> 08:04.951
Honey, I'm home!

08:05.039 --> 08:06.254
Fiona, come meet my

08:06.342 --> 08:08.859
great-great-great-great-great-
great-grandfather.

08:10.021 --> 08:13.274
These are my babes.

08:13.361 --> 08:14.704
Here you are, Fiona.

08:14.791 --> 08:16.803
Hey, you can give her
your fish heads, lads.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.514
Man, where you want
these fish heads, man?

08:19.601 --> 08:21.474
In the trash
or in the garbage?

08:21.561 --> 08:24.965
Just give them all to Fiona here,
she'll make a great fish head stew.

08:25.053 --> 08:26.554
Fish heads in hot water,

08:26.641 --> 08:29.184
a dinner fit for kings, eh?

08:29.271 --> 08:31.324
Angel, I have to go to the
bank with these fine people

08:31.411 --> 08:33.024
and help them get us
millions of dollars.

08:33.111 --> 08:35.037
And then I'll come home
and eat a bite of stew,

08:35.125 --> 08:36.754
and then get to the
hospital for my night shift

08:36.842 --> 08:38.621
where I remove
rectums from cadavers.

08:39.945 --> 08:43.503
So the scientists who study these
rectums can find a cure!

08:43.591 --> 08:45.113
Now, let me go put on a tie.

08:45.201 --> 08:46.834
We're going
to a bank after all.

08:46.921 --> 08:49.389
Show some respect
to the financial institution.

08:49.590 --> 08:51.903
He's such a good man.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.744
Such a good husband
and father.

08:54.831 --> 08:56.975
And he works so hard.

08:57.201 --> 08:59.801
Now, let's go get you
your money, sir.

09:01.241 --> 09:04.027
Marquess, these people
need the money more than you.

09:04.115 --> 09:06.223
- It's my money.
- Not really.

09:06.311 --> 09:09.123
He's your living heir. You can't even
get it out of the bank without him.

09:09.211 --> 09:10.787
Ugh! Fine!

09:10.875 --> 09:12.858
Ian? Ian?

09:13.121 --> 09:14.934
Okay, Ian, listen.

09:15.021 --> 09:18.434
You are my great-great-
great-great-great-grandson.

09:18.521 --> 09:20.274
And more importantly,

09:20.361 --> 09:24.404
you are a great, great, great,
great, great human being.

09:24.553 --> 09:27.044
So, I'm gonna split
the money with you.

09:27.131 --> 09:29.844
You're gonna receive
$2.5 million.

09:29.931 --> 09:31.150
I don't know what to say.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.452
That's the kindest thing
anyone has ever done for me.

09:33.540 --> 09:34.593
Aw.

09:34.681 --> 09:39.207
Oh. Oh! Even the rain smells
in this godforsaken place.

09:39.295 --> 09:41.394
- That's because it's piss.
- Ugh!

09:41.481 --> 09:43.924
Alastair Flanagan,
have you no shame?

09:44.011 --> 09:45.981
Use a cludgie
like the rest of us.

09:46.069 --> 09:48.243
Oh. "Cludgie"
means bathroom.

09:48.766 --> 09:50.304
Ah, this traffic.

09:50.391 --> 09:52.634
The bank closes at 5:00.

09:52.721 --> 09:55.274
Wait. Why are we stopping?

09:55.361 --> 09:56.429
Come on, lads.

09:56.517 --> 09:58.200
What is happening?

09:58.461 --> 10:00.174
Where are we going?

10:02.000 --> 10:08.074

10:13.139 --> 10:15.319
Lads, this fine man,

10:15.522 --> 10:18.036
John Douglas,
the Marquess of Queensberry,

10:18.124 --> 10:19.880
has gifted me
half of his fortune.

10:19.968 --> 10:22.104
And just as
he's shared it with me,

10:22.191 --> 10:25.504
I intend on sharing mine
with all of you.

10:25.591 --> 10:27.833
Our days of gutting fish
are over.

10:27.921 --> 10:30.304
We'll have more time to spend
with our loved ones.

10:32.401 --> 10:35.676
All right, okay,
that was very nice,

10:35.764 --> 10:37.944
but we should really get
going before the bank closes.

10:38.031 --> 10:40.884
So, let's give three cheers
for John Douglas,

10:40.971 --> 10:42.854
the Marquess of Queensberry.

10:42.952 --> 10:45.005
- Hip hip...
- Hurray! - Hurray! - Hurray! - Hurray!

10:45.093 --> 10:46.427
- Okay.
- Hip hip...

10:46.515 --> 10:48.200
- Hurray! - Hurray! - Hurray!
- Yeah. We got it.

10:48.288 --> 10:49.663
- Hip hip...
- Hurray! - Hurray! - Hurray!

10:49.751 --> 10:51.024
Okay, that's three, let's go.

10:51.111 --> 10:52.264
- Hip hip...
- Hurray!

10:52.351 --> 10:53.494
- Hip hip...
- Michael!

10:53.581 --> 10:55.264
Jesus! Quiet! Back to work.

10:55.398 --> 10:56.804
- Hip hip...
- Hurray! - Hurray! - Hurray!

10:56.891 --> 10:59.774
Come on! Do you want
your money or not?

11:07.401 --> 11:11.384
Can I change my peak?
This is the new peak of my day.

11:19.780 --> 11:23.763
Damn, son, see if I got any financial
funds laying around anywhere.

11:23.851 --> 11:24.864
Oh.

11:30.517 --> 11:31.700
Do you?

11:31.921 --> 11:33.688
I have nothing.
