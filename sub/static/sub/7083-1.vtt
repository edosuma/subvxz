00:47.400 --> 00:49.333
<i>For the last 12 years,</i>

00:49.334 --> 00:52.137
<i>Biblical archaeologist Don Verdean</i>

00:52.138 --> 00:54.038
<i>has received worldwide acclaim</i>

00:54.039 --> 00:56.875
<i>for his incredible
discoveries in the Holy Land.</i>

00:56.876 --> 00:59.878
<i>Don's discoveries have touched the lives</i>

00:59.879 --> 01:01.412
<i>of countless millions,</i>

01:01.413 --> 01:04.348
<i>confirming their faith and
the miraculous narratives</i>

01:04.349 --> 01:06.984
<i>found in the Bible.</i>

01:06.985 --> 01:08.919
<i>On his latest trip
to the Middle East,</i>

01:08.920 --> 01:13.023
<i>Don contacted Adabi
Hassan from Saudi Arabia,</i>

01:13.024 --> 01:15.427
<i>who agreed to accompany
Don to a location</i>

01:15.428 --> 01:19.297
<i>rumored to be the burial site
of Samson from the Bible.</i>

01:19.298 --> 01:21.767
<i>But, sadly, upon their arrival,</i>

01:21.768 --> 01:25.202
<i>all that remained of the
site was a large, empty hole</i>

01:25.203 --> 01:27.906
<i>caused by looting
the previous month.</i>

01:27.907 --> 01:29.541
<i>Don was devastated.</i>

01:29.542 --> 01:32.344
<i>Adabi then informed him
of a lesser known location</i>

01:32.345 --> 01:34.079
<i>in the valley of Sorek.</i>

01:34.080 --> 01:36.547
<i>After months of intense excavation,</i>

01:36.548 --> 01:39.216
<i>Don made the discovery
of a lifetime...</i>

01:39.217 --> 01:44.055
<i>iron shears dating
back over 3,000 years.</i>

01:44.056 --> 01:46.023
<i>Could these be the very blades</i>

01:46.024 --> 01:48.460
<i>used to strip Samson
of his strength?</i>

01:48.461 --> 01:50.461
<i>Don decided to share his findings</i>

01:50.462 --> 01:53.264
<i>with Dr. Stelios Patrokolis,</i>

01:53.265 --> 01:56.934
<i>world-renowned for his excavations
of the Byzantine Empire.</i>

01:56.935 --> 02:00.305
<i>After reviewing the forensic data,</i>

02:00.306 --> 02:04.177
<i>Dr. Patrokolis made the
following statement:</i>

02:16.221 --> 02:18.456
I'll bet.

02:18.457 --> 02:21.526
<i>After this brief
interview with Dr. Patrokolis,</i>

02:21.527 --> 02:24.563
<i>Don's discovery was made public.</i>

02:24.564 --> 02:28.567
<i>He now travels the world
sharing his message of faith</i>

02:28.568 --> 02:31.671
<i>to a whole new
generation of believers.</i>

02:32.971 --> 02:34.973
<i>The tireless efforts of Don Verdean</i>

02:34.974 --> 02:38.277
<i>will continue to bless
millions everywhere.</i>

02:46.052 --> 02:47.720
Next question.

02:48.521 --> 02:50.956
Yeah?

02:50.957 --> 02:53.992
Mr. Verdean, there's a... a, uh, letter.

02:53.993 --> 02:56.260
Well, it's an online document

02:56.261 --> 02:58.263
that's received wide distribution

02:58.264 --> 03:00.998
throughout the ministry, as
I'm... I'm sure you've seen it.

03:00.999 --> 03:03.301
It's, for the record, from the, uh,

03:03.302 --> 03:05.302
Israeli Antiquities Authority.

03:05.303 --> 03:07.906
I'd like to share that,
if that's all right.

03:07.907 --> 03:10.442
<i>Yes, go right ahead.</i>

03:10.443 --> 03:13.378
"Thank you for your inquiry dated July 13th

03:13.379 --> 03:16.247
asking about Don Verdean.

03:16.248 --> 03:18.415
We cannot confirm his finds

03:18.416 --> 03:21.319
and have no information
about them whatsoever.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.320
<i>If he says he has
excavated in Israel,</i>

03:23.321 --> 03:26.157
<i>he has committed an illegal act.</i>

03:26.158 --> 03:27.492
<i>We have never heard of this man,</i>

03:27.493 --> 03:29.628
<i>nor have we had any
dealings with him.</i>

03:29.629 --> 03:32.264
Legitimate archaeology finds

03:32.265 --> 03:35.033
are published in professional journals

03:35.034 --> 03:39.403
or by universities and
other scientific institutes.

03:39.404 --> 03:42.307
Sincerely yours, Nahum Ishalom,

03:42.308 --> 03:45.245
spokesman for Israeli Antiquities."

03:46.678 --> 03:49.181
<i>Thank you. Thank
you for reading that.</i>

03:53.351 --> 03:54.920
Now, uh,

03:54.921 --> 03:58.622
Satan takes advantage
of situations like this.

03:58.623 --> 04:00.992
There's two things happening here.

04:00.993 --> 04:04.628
One, the Israelis don't
want this discovery confirmed

04:04.629 --> 04:06.497
until, you know,

04:06.498 --> 04:09.934
it can be done in a manner
that won't cause a bloodbath.

04:09.935 --> 04:13.237
Two, all of my excavating was done

04:13.238 --> 04:16.074
in a very public place,

04:16.075 --> 04:18.375
and had I done it without a permit,

04:18.375 --> 04:22.213
I can assure you I would've
been thrown in prison.

04:22.214 --> 04:27.084
<i>Unfortunately, this is how
the Israelis handle things.</i>

04:27.085 --> 04:29.321
If you ask any of them

04:29.322 --> 04:33.226
if they know Don Verdean,
they'll say they don't.

04:34.592 --> 04:36.360
Carol, did you, uh...

04:36.361 --> 04:37.995
bring that book with you?

04:37.996 --> 04:40.732
The one with my ugly face on the front?

04:41.599 --> 04:43.435
Could you hand it to me?

04:44.236 --> 04:45.838
Thank you.

04:47.272 --> 04:50.607
Now...

04:50.608 --> 04:53.745
if you'll all be so kind
as to look right here.

04:53.746 --> 04:57.482
In this picture, you will
see myself and another man.

04:57.483 --> 04:59.651
This gentleman standing next to me

04:59.652 --> 05:02.653
is none other than Nahum Ishalom,

05:02.654 --> 05:05.357
spokesman for the Israeli Antiquities

05:05.358 --> 05:09.229
and author of the letter
that was just read to you.

05:10.662 --> 05:15.266
When asked if he knew
Don Verdean, he said "no."

05:15.267 --> 05:17.002
But if you look at this picture,

05:17.003 --> 05:19.271
you'll see that the
truth is something else.

05:27.012 --> 05:28.615
Thank you so much.

05:33.719 --> 05:37.557
<i>- ♪ You may ask me how I know ♪
- You bet. Let's take a picture.</i>

05:39.457 --> 05:41.793
<i>♪ My Lord is real... ♪</i>

05:41.794 --> 05:43.694
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

05:43.695 --> 05:46.264
<i>♪ My Lord is real... ♪</i>

05:46.265 --> 05:48.199
<i>Let me make one thing clear.</i>

05:48.200 --> 05:51.136
<i>These things are God's
things, not my things.</i>

05:51.137 --> 05:53.737
He is allowed me to find these treasures

05:53.738 --> 05:55.639
because I am simple man.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.608
<i>It's very obvious that
I have never found</i>

05:57.609 --> 06:00.578
anything based on my own intellect.

06:00.579 --> 06:03.447
Nobody on Earth is...
is clever enough to...

06:03.448 --> 06:06.083
...find these
things of their own volition.

06:06.084 --> 06:07.352
<i>- That's right.</i>
- You know.

06:07.353 --> 06:09.586
I work with Tony Lazarus,

06:09.587 --> 06:12.757
and we'd love to set up a meeting
with Mr. Verdean, if we could.

06:12.758 --> 06:17.161
<i>♪ I can feel His hand in mine ♪</i>

06:17.162 --> 06:22.367
<i>♪ And that's enough for me. ♪</i>

06:24.169 --> 06:27.538
How'd we do tonight?

06:27.539 --> 06:30.141
Oh, everyone just loved
your presentation, Don,

06:30.142 --> 06:32.576
but we only sold about 10 copies.

06:32.577 --> 06:35.780
Well, long as kept a few
sheep from goin' astray,

06:35.781 --> 06:38.115
can't ask for much more than that.

06:38.116 --> 06:40.552
What's the rest of our week lookin' like?

06:40.553 --> 06:42.586
Well, the Friday lecture group

06:42.587 --> 06:44.822
for the Bible study class just cancelled.

06:44.823 --> 06:48.425
Well, that's unfortunate.

06:48.426 --> 06:50.295
But I did get a request from a place called

06:50.296 --> 06:52.696
The Lazarus Fellowship Center.

06:52.697 --> 06:56.401
<i>Apparently, their pastor's just
dyin' to meet with you tomorrow.</i>

06:56.402 --> 07:00.170
Wait... wait a second, are
you talkin' about Tony Lazarus?

07:00.171 --> 07:02.439
Yes. Should I know who that is?

07:02.440 --> 07:05.809
Well, Tony died in a
car accident 10 years ago

07:05.810 --> 07:08.245
while drivin' to Wendover with a hooker.

07:08.246 --> 07:10.381
<i>The spirit left his
body and everything,</i>

07:10.382 --> 07:12.550
but the good Lord decided
to give him a second chance

07:12.551 --> 07:15.386
and send him back to Earth
as a modern day Lazarus.

07:15.387 --> 07:17.588
Incredible.

07:17.589 --> 07:19.189
Tony married the hooker and they started

07:19.190 --> 07:20.824
their own ministry together.

07:20.825 --> 07:22.494
Wow.

07:22.495 --> 07:25.262
Tony Lazarus.

07:25.263 --> 07:26.797
What time's he want to see me tomorrow?

07:26.798 --> 07:29.333
First thing in the morning.

07:32.238 --> 07:34.540
<i>Praised be the
Lord, there he is.</i>

07:36.308 --> 07:37.675
Whoo!

07:37.676 --> 07:41.278
Oh, well...

07:43.448 --> 07:44.848
It is such a pleasure to see you.

07:44.849 --> 07:47.352
And an absolute honor to finally meet ya.

07:47.353 --> 07:49.586
I've been followin' your work for
years. I feel like I already know ya.

07:49.587 --> 07:51.756
Well, it's a real pleasure to be here.

07:51.757 --> 07:53.824
I-I-I tell
you what, I...

07:53.825 --> 07:55.826
Well, this is my beautiful wife, Joylinda.

07:55.827 --> 07:58.429
- Oh.
- I've seen the pictures.

07:58.430 --> 08:00.398
Lovely to meet you.

08:00.399 --> 08:02.800
I bet these hands have touched all kinds

08:02.801 --> 08:04.602
- of sacred relics.
- Yes, ma'am.

08:04.603 --> 08:06.437
Just a few.

08:06.438 --> 08:08.239
And who's your wonderful companion?

08:08.240 --> 08:09.706
Who? Oh, yes! I'm sorry.

08:09.707 --> 08:11.942
This is my car... uh,
secretary. Carol Jensen.

08:11.943 --> 08:13.877
- Carol? Oh, that's a lovely name.
- Yes.

08:13.878 --> 08:15.547
- Thank you.
- We're just so happy you two could be here.

08:15.548 --> 08:17.482
Please, please, y'all, come have a seat.

08:17.483 --> 08:19.550
We're so grateful you're
here. We have much to discuss.

08:19.551 --> 08:22.220
- Come take a seat.
- Whoo!

08:22.221 --> 08:24.355
I feel it!

08:24.356 --> 08:26.423
Well, Don, it should be no surprise to you

08:26.424 --> 08:27.958
that we are all big fans.

08:27.959 --> 08:29.660
I mean, perhaps your biggest fans.

08:29.661 --> 08:31.829
We've seen all the DVDs,
read all your books.

08:31.830 --> 08:34.532
There is no one in the
world that does what you do.

08:34.533 --> 08:37.936
Well, thank you, Tony.
I've been very fortunate.

08:37.937 --> 08:39.870
<i>Well, God knows what He's doin'.</i>

08:39.871 --> 08:41.940
Don, if you would bear with
me, I'm just gonna go ahead

08:41.941 --> 08:44.208
and cut to the chase and tell
you why I brought you here.

08:44.210 --> 08:47.544
<i>As I'm sure you're aware,
church attendance in America</i>

08:47.545 --> 08:50.280
has been on a massive
decline in recent years.

08:50.281 --> 08:54.219
And I've felt the effects of that
right here in my very own congregation.

08:54.220 --> 08:56.520
Slowly but surely, this
nation is becommin' godless,

08:56.521 --> 08:58.255
and it's frightening.

08:58.256 --> 08:59.923
<i>I mean, not to mention the
fact that there is a...</i>

08:59.924 --> 09:02.594
a new church that has sprung
up mere blocks from here.

09:02.595 --> 09:05.763
The pastor there has been
siphonin' my flock for months now.

09:05.764 --> 09:07.966
You know, he's a former
Satanist turned Christian.

09:07.967 --> 09:10.368
<i>Oh, people are really
taken by his story.</i>

09:10.369 --> 09:13.403
Oh, yes, but I fear he's
leadin' them down the wrong path.

09:13.404 --> 09:14.839
You see,

09:14.840 --> 09:17.408
he holds them with...
with a fear of the occult.

09:17.409 --> 09:18.576
That's how he keeps his numbers up,

09:18.577 --> 09:20.611
and that is not a good foundation.

09:20.612 --> 09:22.980
And right now, Don, people need
a good foundation more than ever.

09:22.981 --> 09:24.682
You got that right.

09:24.683 --> 09:27.317
False prophets aside,
there are some evil factions

09:27.318 --> 09:29.019
"withinside" the scientific community

09:29.020 --> 09:31.655
that are dead-set upon
destroyin' the truth.

09:31.656 --> 09:33.825
You know, the other day I
was walkin' down the street

09:33.826 --> 09:35.793
and this man told me... he said,

09:35.794 --> 09:38.997
"Did you know that we have
evolved from protozoas?"

09:39.898 --> 09:41.466
Do you know what a protozoa is?

09:41.467 --> 09:42.899
No, I do not.

09:42.900 --> 09:45.302
It's a God dong sea monkey.

09:45.303 --> 09:47.938
- Say what?
- Can you imagine that?

09:47.939 --> 09:49.673
Lookin' around at the loved ones...

09:49.674 --> 09:52.409
at your mother, at your
father, at your beautiful wife,

09:52.410 --> 09:54.345
and sayin', "You're a sea monkey.

09:54.346 --> 09:56.748
You belong on the bookshelf of a child

09:56.749 --> 09:58.483
<i>that's going to neglect you</i>

09:58.484 --> 10:00.817
and watch you swim around for a few days

10:00.818 --> 10:03.020
and then end up falling to the bottom

10:03.021 --> 10:05.556
of the sea monkey aquarium
and turning into dust."

10:05.557 --> 10:07.557
Holy Ghost power. That's awful.

10:07.558 --> 10:10.360
Did you evolve from that, Don?

10:10.361 --> 10:12.562
Now, you see, these
younger generations, Don,

10:12.563 --> 10:14.532
they need proof. Okay?

10:14.533 --> 10:16.967
They need hard evidence
in these dark, dark, times.

10:16.968 --> 10:19.970
And I believe that the
Lord has been preparing you.

10:19.971 --> 10:22.307
<i>The Lord wants you to be His...</i>

10:22.308 --> 10:24.775
<i>His instrument in this great work.</i>

10:24.776 --> 10:26.844
Now, what I'm proposing, Don,

10:26.845 --> 10:28.845
is that you allow us

10:28.846 --> 10:31.648
to participate with you in this great work

10:31.649 --> 10:33.784
by letting us bankroll

10:33.785 --> 10:36.520
all your future digs and projects.

10:39.091 --> 10:41.658
I honestly don't know what to say.

10:41.659 --> 10:43.727
Any artifact you would find, you would...

10:43.728 --> 10:46.331
you would bring it here and we'd
present it to our congregation.

10:46.332 --> 10:50.435
And we'd put it on display for
the whole world to see His truth.

10:50.436 --> 10:54.071
It'd be like a little museum of
sorts here at the Lazarus Fellowship.

10:54.072 --> 10:55.740
<i>It would
be like a Holy Land</i>

10:55.741 --> 10:57.774
<i>set in the good ol', U.S. of A.</i>

10:57.775 --> 11:01.747
Right here, where it
should be. Not over there.

11:03.716 --> 11:05.817
Well, Tony, I think it's very clear to me

11:05.818 --> 11:08.019
that the hand of... Providence

11:08.020 --> 11:10.955
has... brought us to this juncture.

11:10.956 --> 11:13.691
I-I think it's fair to say this
might be a match made in heaven.

11:13.692 --> 11:15.960
<i>Oh, I was hopin'
you were gonna say that.</i>

11:15.961 --> 11:18.929
Don, we have been prayin'
so long and hard for this,

11:18.930 --> 11:22.633
and we would love nothin' more than
to begin this adventure immediately.

11:22.634 --> 11:24.969
Well, today's your lucky day.

11:24.970 --> 11:26.903
I believe I have a solid lead

11:26.904 --> 11:28.806
on the location of Lot's wife.

11:28.807 --> 11:30.807
You gotta be kiddin' me.

11:37.649 --> 11:40.985
<i>Two weeks ago my sources
inside Israel sent me this.</i>

11:40.986 --> 11:43.388
Approximately three furlongs to the south

11:43.389 --> 11:46.058
of where I discovered the sulfuric
remains of Sodom and Gomorrah.

11:50.596 --> 11:52.663
This is incredible.

11:52.664 --> 11:55.399
Have the Israelis tested
this for salt content?

11:55.400 --> 11:58.068
The sample taken to the lab
indicated that this structure

11:58.069 --> 12:01.405
was made up of 97% sodium chloride.

12:01.406 --> 12:04.575
I was told that's the purest
salt they've ever tested.

12:07.612 --> 12:09.315
I don't know what to say.

12:10.948 --> 12:13.418
I mean, Don, you've
actually found Lot's wife.

12:16.154 --> 12:18.956
It's all right, sweetheart.

12:22.561 --> 12:24.128
When can we bring her here?

12:32.136 --> 12:34.871
Hi, shalom, Boaz?

12:34.872 --> 12:37.041
It's Don Verdean.

12:37.042 --> 12:39.076
I can... I can barely hear you.

12:39.077 --> 12:41.778
Boaz, it's Don Verdean

12:41.779 --> 12:43.614
from America. How are ya?

12:43.615 --> 12:46.750
<i>Shem, sheket. Sheket!</i>

12:46.751 --> 12:48.852
Shalom
<i>from... can you hear me?</i>

12:48.853 --> 12:50.821
No, tell the camel, "Shut up."

12:50.822 --> 12:52.523
The camel keep talking.

12:52.524 --> 12:55.592
Boaz, it's Don Verdean from America.

12:55.593 --> 12:57.595
- How are ya?
- <i>Hello, Don.</i>

12:57.596 --> 12:59.831
Ah, yes, it's me, Boaz.

12:59.832 --> 13:01.798
Uh, what's up, man?

13:01.799 --> 13:04.735
Well, uh, good news. You
remember that pillar of salt

13:04.736 --> 13:06.937
you and your brother found out
in the desert two weeks ago?

13:06.938 --> 13:09.874
Well, I need you to ship it to me.

13:09.875 --> 13:12.009
I can wire you the money tonight.

13:12.010 --> 13:15.111
- Oh, yeah, yeah, that thing.
- Yeah, about that.

13:15.112 --> 13:17.682
That's not there anymore.

13:17.683 --> 13:19.484
<i>Uh, I'm sorry, say that again?</i>

13:19.485 --> 13:21.251
I said, "That is not there anymore."

13:21.252 --> 13:23.553
What do you mean, "It's not there anymore"?

13:23.554 --> 13:26.190
- Where'd it go?
- <i>Me and Shem were out there today,</i>

13:26.191 --> 13:28.625
and we're looking and we're looking,

13:28.626 --> 13:32.196
but, uh, we don't see her.

13:32.197 --> 13:35.166
Well, are you sure you're
looking in the right place?

13:35.167 --> 13:37.168
No?

13:37.169 --> 13:39.736
- <i>Uh, say what?</i>
- Uh, maybe.

13:39.737 --> 13:41.672
<i>Now come on, Boaz!</i>

13:41.673 --> 13:43.807
I mean, this could be
the find of the century.

13:43.808 --> 13:45.509
I mean, we're talkin'
about Lot's wife here.

13:45.510 --> 13:47.177
<i>There are a lot of
rocks out there, Don.</i>

13:47.178 --> 13:49.779
They all look the same. How
do I know which one is the one?

13:49.780 --> 13:51.916
Well, it can't be that hard.

13:51.917 --> 13:54.251
We need the one with breasts.

13:54.252 --> 13:57.922
Oh, the breasts. Okay, that one.

13:57.923 --> 14:01.926
- Oh, yeah.
- There's one big white rock,

14:01.927 --> 14:04.061
and it has breasts on it.

14:04.062 --> 14:06.696
All right. Chill out, <i>sababa.</i>

14:06.697 --> 14:08.666
- It's cool.
- <i>No, it's not cool!</i>

14:08.667 --> 14:11.802
Okay? Get the Marines, get the Taliban,

14:11.803 --> 14:14.839
get the Mormon Tabernacle
Choir, if you have to,

14:14.840 --> 14:16.974
but find the pillar of salt!

14:16.975 --> 14:18.909
Now, don't you be facetious, Don.

14:18.910 --> 14:20.778
<i>Don't screw this up, Boaz.</i>

14:20.779 --> 14:22.846
You get her on a plane tomorrow.

14:22.847 --> 14:26.817
There are countless souls whose
very salvation is at stake here.

14:26.818 --> 14:29.220
You do not want their blood on your hands.

14:29.221 --> 14:31.821
- <i>Do you want to go to hell?</i>
- No.

14:31.822 --> 14:34.091
- <i>Do you believe in hell?</i>
- I'm not sure,

14:34.092 --> 14:36.092
but I don't take chances.

14:36.093 --> 14:38.095
<i>All right, well, I'll wire
you the money tonight.</i>

14:38.096 --> 14:40.063
- <i>Hey, Don?</i>
- What?

14:40.064 --> 14:42.299
<i>Catch you later, man.</i>

14:42.300 --> 14:45.001
All right, well, I'll catch you later, too.

14:45.002 --> 14:47.005
All right. Goodbye, now.

14:47.838 --> 14:50.575
Good Lord, have mercy.

15:06.792 --> 15:08.828
I brought you some supper.

15:10.028 --> 15:11.861
You didn't have to do that.

15:11.862 --> 15:15.666
It's just some pot stickers
and a raisin cookie.

15:15.667 --> 15:17.735
Well, I don't care much for raisins,

15:17.736 --> 15:20.303
<i>but thank you.</i>

15:20.304 --> 15:24.174
Carol, how long you
been workin' for me now?

15:24.175 --> 15:27.311
- Almost eight months.
- <i>Wow.</i>

15:27.312 --> 15:30.748
Time's really flown by.

15:30.749 --> 15:32.783
<i>Well, after what's transpired today,</i>

15:32.784 --> 15:35.786
<i>I need you to cancel
the rest of the tour.</i>

15:35.787 --> 15:37.388
But, more importantly, it doesn't look like

15:37.389 --> 15:40.358
I'm gonna need anyone to
manage my schedule anymore.

15:41.994 --> 15:44.361
Oh, uh, uh, okay.

15:44.362 --> 15:46.096
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Well, um,

15:46.097 --> 15:48.365
I'm happy to stick around a few more days

15:48.366 --> 15:50.033
to help you transition.

15:50.034 --> 15:52.836
What? No. No, no, Carol,

15:52.837 --> 15:56.072
you're not getting fired.
I-I-I want to promote you

15:56.073 --> 15:59.210
<i>to research assistant
and field documentarian.</i>

15:59.211 --> 16:02.113
Oh, Don, I would be honored!

16:03.781 --> 16:06.951
Carol, I want to make one thing very clear.

16:06.952 --> 16:09.820
Finding treasure in
the Earth is meaningless

16:09.821 --> 16:11.788
unless it will help someone get to heaven

16:11.789 --> 16:13.923
<i>that wouldn't get there otherwise.</i>

16:13.924 --> 16:16.661
That's what I admire about you, Don.

16:16.662 --> 16:18.428
You're in this for all the right reasons.

16:20.332 --> 16:22.001
Well...

16:23.669 --> 16:25.671
- good night.
- <i>Night.</i>

16:29.040 --> 16:32.510
Ah!

17:07.912 --> 17:11.147
Well, there she is. Lot's wife.

17:11.148 --> 17:14.484
Don, don't get me wrong, I
mean, she obviously is beautiful,

17:14.486 --> 17:17.253
but, uh, is it just me, or does she look

17:17.255 --> 17:18.888
a little different than
she does in the, uh,

17:18.890 --> 17:20.925
photograph the Israelis sent you?

17:20.925 --> 17:24.462
<i>Well, Tony, I'm always
amazed at how certain artifacts</i>

17:24.463 --> 17:27.732
have the ability to
completely re-write history.

17:27.733 --> 17:30.133
<i>Based on the evidence
standing right here before us,</i>

17:30.134 --> 17:32.369
I think it's very plausible that

17:32.370 --> 17:34.440
Lot's wife was a hermaphrodite.

17:35.974 --> 17:37.908
<i>I'm sure it was quite
common in those days.</i>

17:37.909 --> 17:40.878
Limited gene pool,
incest, and what have you.

17:40.879 --> 17:43.046
That would probably explain why Lot's wife

17:43.047 --> 17:45.416
was so dead-set upon returning
to the Forbidden City.

17:45.417 --> 17:47.418
<i>Bingo.</i>

17:47.419 --> 17:49.152
My only fear is the, uh,

17:49.153 --> 17:51.421
milk drinkers of my congregation.

17:51.422 --> 17:54.625
Is this meat going to be
too much for them to swallow?

18:03.400 --> 18:07.071
- Hello?
- Boaz, what in the hell did you send me?!

18:07.072 --> 18:08.906
<i>What do you mean
what did we send you?</i>

18:08.907 --> 18:11.508
We sent you Lot's wife. The
one with the two breasts.

18:11.509 --> 18:13.276
Well, she also came

18:13.277 --> 18:16.781
with a veritable fruit salad in her pants!

18:16.782 --> 18:18.783
<i>Now, come on, Boaz!</i>

18:18.784 --> 18:21.952
I just can't tolerate this
type of sloppy archaeology.

18:21.953 --> 18:23.987
<i>Let me ask you this,</i>

18:23.988 --> 18:27.457
which one of you screwed
up my pillar of salt?!

18:27.458 --> 18:30.927
<i>Don, Don, this is the real
Lot's wife. I promise you.</i>

18:30.928 --> 18:33.330
She was smuggled straight
out of the Holy Land.

18:33.331 --> 18:36.065
<i>I know it's different from
the picture we sent you,</i>

18:36.066 --> 18:39.069
<i>but this one matches the
description in the "Bibla."</i>

18:39.070 --> 18:41.171
- What did you say?
- <i>You have to believe me</i>

18:41.172 --> 18:43.006
<i>that this is really her, Don.</i>

18:43.007 --> 18:45.208
This is Lot's wife.

18:45.209 --> 18:48.478
<i>I'm telling you, Don.
I'd bet my life on it.</i>

18:48.479 --> 18:50.380

Beautiful voice, beautiful message.

20:08.525 --> 20:10.895
Brothers and sisters, I am humbled

20:10.896 --> 20:13.330
by what I am going to share with you.

20:13.331 --> 20:15.131
Just a few weeks ago,

20:15.132 --> 20:17.901
an incredible discovery
was found in Israel.

20:17.902 --> 20:20.471
<i>World renowned
archaeologist Don Verdean</i>

20:20.472 --> 20:22.907
<i>and his team of experts</i>

20:22.908 --> 20:25.109
have uncovered what many scholars believe

20:25.110 --> 20:27.444
to be the remains of Lot's wife,

20:27.445 --> 20:31.447
as found in Genesis 19, verse 26.

20:31.448 --> 20:34.584
<i>"His wife looked
back from behind him</i>

20:34.585 --> 20:37.187
<i>and she became a pillar of salt."</i>

20:37.188 --> 20:41.024
Just when the world thought that
the windows of heaven were closed,

20:41.025 --> 20:44.294
the Lord has granted us a miracle.

20:44.295 --> 20:45.963
And an answer

20:45.964 --> 20:49.099
to life's greatest mystery.

20:49.100 --> 20:52.402
Who was this woman, and
why was she so dead-set

20:52.403 --> 20:54.205
about returning to that hellhole?

20:55.072 --> 20:56.940
<i>Without further ado,</i>

20:56.941 --> 20:59.677
I present to you the
first of what I hope to be

20:59.678 --> 21:02.545
many archaeological discoveries

21:02.546 --> 21:05.181
to prove that the Bible

21:05.182 --> 21:06.951
is true.

21:36.281 --> 21:37.949
Hallelujah.

21:39.016 --> 21:40.618
<i>Praise the Lord.</i>

21:41.453 --> 21:42.719
Whoo!

21:42.720 --> 21:44.521
Blessed be.

21:54.399 --> 21:57.033
Whoo.

22:01.105 --> 22:03.540
<i>Thank you. Praise God.</i>

22:03.541 --> 22:05.441
Congratulations, Tony.

22:05.442 --> 22:07.011
<i>Impressive turnout today.</i>

22:07.012 --> 22:09.612
Looks like your ministry
is almost relevant again.

22:09.613 --> 22:12.282
Don, this is Dennis Fontaine.

22:12.283 --> 22:14.650
He's from the Friendship Harvest Temple.

22:14.651 --> 22:17.888
- Ah, good to meet ya.
<i>- You know, a funny little piece of trivia</i>

22:18.620 --> 22:20.556
- about Mr. Fontaine, he used to be a Satanist.
- Is that right?

22:20.557 --> 22:22.626
Oh, yeah. He was a high priest.

22:22.627 --> 22:24.762
Participated in the orgies, the whole deal.

22:24.763 --> 22:27.630
Then one day he woke up and decided
he was playin' for the wrong team.

22:27.631 --> 22:29.166
Decided to become a Christian.

22:29.167 --> 22:31.467
Quite a discovery you've made here.

22:31.468 --> 22:33.236
Where exactly was it located?

22:33.237 --> 22:36.305
In the Valley of Sittim,
Southern tip of the Dead Sea.

22:36.306 --> 22:38.508
Ah, I'm sure it was.

22:38.509 --> 22:40.310
My colleague Dr. Stanley here

22:40.311 --> 22:42.646
teaches life sciences
at Sioux Valley Vo-Tech.

22:42.647 --> 22:45.215
<i>He was wondering if he could
take a sample back to his lab</i>

22:45.216 --> 22:47.316
<i>for carbon dating purposes?</i>

22:47.317 --> 22:50.754
What makes you think you can carbon
date the wrath of the Almighty?

22:50.755 --> 22:53.724
<i>Besides, anyone with a brain
knows that carbon dating</i>

22:53.725 --> 22:57.194
<i>is completely ineffective when
dealing with mineralized fossil.</i>

22:57.195 --> 22:58.629
The isotopes are rendered useless.

22:58.630 --> 23:00.229
Why don't you leave the science

23:00.230 --> 23:02.398
to the scientists, Mr. Verdean?

23:02.399 --> 23:05.202
Why don't you leave the things
of God in the hands of his people?

23:05.203 --> 23:08.405
Just thought you boys might like some
forensic data to back up your claims.

23:08.406 --> 23:11.742
But I totally understand if
you're skittish about the results.

23:11.743 --> 23:14.610
I think you might be better off
gettin' some of your own lab work done,

23:14.611 --> 23:18.081
<i>make sure your blood ain't loaded
with V.D. from your Satanic orgy days.</i>

23:18.082 --> 23:19.582
Hey, you better watch yourself.

23:19.583 --> 23:21.485
You better watch yourself.
Fontaine, get ahold of

23:21.486 --> 23:24.254
"Planet of the Apes" here.

23:24.255 --> 23:27.523
You put this jackrabbit in a
corner, he's gonna find a way out.

23:27.524 --> 23:29.293
Look, you can avoid the facts all you want,

23:29.294 --> 23:31.527
but sooner or later
people will want the truth.

23:31.528 --> 23:33.731
Get ready for it.

23:37.634 --> 23:40.637
Fontaine!

23:40.638 --> 23:42.738
I know you'd like to take a
sample back to your machine,

23:42.739 --> 23:44.241
but you can find out what it's made of

23:44.242 --> 23:46.110
right now with a good,
old-fashioned lick test.

23:53.884 --> 23:56.386
What in the world was that?

23:56.387 --> 23:59.656
I believe that was some
sort of demonic hiss.

23:59.657 --> 24:02.661
Yo, Don, I'm not so sure that
was a wise move to challenge him.

24:12.169 --> 24:13.603
<i>I don't think
you could have asked</i>

24:13.604 --> 24:15.304
for a better reaction today.

24:15.305 --> 24:17.341
The look on everyone's
faces should be bottled up

24:17.342 --> 24:19.408
and sold as an anti-depressant.

24:19.409 --> 24:20.978
Mm-hmm.

24:22.514 --> 24:25.482
Oh, that Joylinda's a real surprise.

24:25.483 --> 24:29.218
She and Tony are perfect for each other.

24:29.219 --> 24:31.687
It's a shame they can't have any kids.

24:31.688 --> 24:33.823
<i>You know, doctor's
say a woman her age...</i>

24:33.824 --> 24:36.459
she should have plenty of fresh eggs.

24:36.460 --> 24:39.562
What in the world are you jabberin' about?

24:39.563 --> 24:41.831
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:41.832 --> 24:45.569
Seems like that pastor may
have shaken you up a bit.

24:45.570 --> 24:48.571
I've had to deal with vipers
like him my whole life.

24:48.572 --> 24:50.373
Nothin' but bottom-dwellers

24:50.374 --> 24:52.609
tryin' to destroy the work.

24:52.610 --> 24:55.812
Oh, I know, but you just gotta
let it just roll right off you.

24:55.813 --> 24:59.448
Well, now, Carol, you need to learn
your place in this partnership.

24:59.449 --> 25:02.518
<i>And right now I need
you to stay quiet</i>

25:02.519 --> 25:05.222
when I think things through.

25:08.825 --> 25:10.793
You know, in the eight
months that you've known me,

25:10.794 --> 25:13.397
you've never asked me one
thing about my personal life.

25:13.398 --> 25:16.366
I-I-I assumed it was a
professional courtesy,

25:16.367 --> 25:20.204
but now I realize you think of
me as a mindless subordinate.

25:20.205 --> 25:22.206
Now, Carol, that's not true.

25:22.207 --> 25:24.341
I just never thought
you had a personal life.

25:24.342 --> 25:27.311
Well, if you cared to ask...

25:27.312 --> 25:29.815
you'd learn that I have a son in prison.

25:33.351 --> 25:35.552
Carol, I-I-I had no
idea you had a son.

25:39.890 --> 25:42.626
<i>He was my youthful indiscretion.</i>

25:44.461 --> 25:47.965
Sometimes I feel like that French
whore from "Les Misérables."

25:55.907 --> 25:58.075
I'm sorry to hear that.

25:59.310 --> 26:01.745
How'd your son end up in prison?

26:01.746 --> 26:04.648
Well, he
said he was starting to become

26:04.649 --> 26:07.850
a Forest Ranger, but he was
actually growing cannabis

26:07.851 --> 26:10.419
in Zion National Park.

26:10.420 --> 26:11.854
Three tons of it.

26:11.855 --> 26:15.258
Good Lord be, that's some serious weed.

26:15.259 --> 26:17.561
Yeah.

26:17.562 --> 26:19.862
Now he's servin' a 12-year sentence.

26:19.863 --> 26:23.000
<i>It's a heavy burden
for a single mother.</i>

26:25.902 --> 26:28.905
All I've ever wished for that
boy is to have a father figure.

26:28.906 --> 26:31.276
He just needed a dad.

26:33.878 --> 26:36.848
I can't believe you've
shouldered this all by yourself.

26:37.948 --> 26:39.750
My life's just been a train wreck.

26:41.052 --> 26:43.052
But ever since I started workin' for you,

26:43.053 --> 26:46.624
I feel like it's slowly
gettin' back on the right track.

26:51.996 --> 26:55.132
Carol, I want you to know
that I'm here for you.

26:56.501 --> 26:58.368
I'm glad you shared that with me.

26:58.369 --> 27:00.971
I-I know it can't be easy bein' the mother

27:00.972 --> 27:03.907
of a dope slinger, but know that God

27:03.908 --> 27:06.709
can heal even the worst of sinners.

27:06.710 --> 27:10.414
He doesn't want anything
to do with that right now.

27:10.415 --> 27:13.684
Well, he'll come 'round.
We'll get that boy saved

27:13.685 --> 27:16.018
if it's the last thing we do.

27:16.019 --> 27:18.421
Now have a bite of your bacon.

27:23.026 --> 27:24.761
Gotta have your protein.

27:24.762 --> 27:26.662
Praise God.

27:29.900 --> 27:31.435
Donald, I'm gonna go ahead
and swing for the fences

27:31.436 --> 27:32.668
with this one, all right?

27:32.669 --> 27:34.737
We're battin' 1,000, so why not?

27:34.738 --> 27:37.040
Lot's wife has gone over like gangbusters,

27:37.041 --> 27:38.708
and we cannot succumb to a sophomore slump.

27:38.709 --> 27:40.476
We need to come correct.

27:40.477 --> 27:43.080
<i>I think the very next
artifact we go after,</i>

27:43.081 --> 27:46.084
Ark of the Covenant.

27:48.052 --> 27:50.353
Well, that's a great idea, Tony, but, uh,

27:50.354 --> 27:51.888
we already know where she is.

27:51.889 --> 27:54.023
We do?

27:54.024 --> 27:56.959
- Where?
<i>- Ethiopia.</i>

27:56.960 --> 27:58.527
It's rested there for hundreds of years

27:58.528 --> 28:00.897
at the church of Our
Lady Mary of Zion in Axum.

28:00.898 --> 28:04.501
It's watched over by a
single guardian monk 24/7.

28:04.502 --> 28:06.605
Does this monk know martial arts?

28:07.671 --> 28:09.939
Tell me this, is there anything into

28:09.940 --> 28:12.609
tryin' to strike up some sort of
friendship with this monk fella?

28:12.610 --> 28:14.610
<i>Convince him to bring
the Ark over here?</i>

28:14.611 --> 28:16.146
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

28:16.147 --> 28:18.381
Years ago, I tried to make
small talk with the fellow

28:18.382 --> 28:21.685
when he came up for air... not a good idea.

28:21.686 --> 28:24.053
Besides, if anyone actually sees the Ark,

28:24.054 --> 28:25.821
they will implode.

28:25.822 --> 28:29.024
Whoo. Well, that sounds
like that would suck.

28:29.025 --> 28:30.894
Frankincense.

28:32.028 --> 28:33.863
Penicillin.

28:33.864 --> 28:36.733
Sweetheart, those are wonderful
ideas, they really are,

28:36.734 --> 28:39.535
<i>but, uh, we don't need
to waste Don's time</i>

28:39.536 --> 28:41.838
findin' penicillin, baby,

28:41.839 --> 28:44.408
'cause we are... the
world has that already.

28:44.409 --> 28:47.610
What about a scuba expedition
to the bottom of the Red Sea?

28:47.611 --> 28:50.013
Search for the remains of Pharaoh's army?

28:50.014 --> 28:52.849
Gold chariots, breastplates, and the like?

28:52.850 --> 28:56.686
Well, the Red Sea's roughly
170,000 square miles of open water.

28:56.687 --> 28:58.821
I'm not sure I'd know where to begin.

28:58.822 --> 29:00.623
Well, I'll tell you where to begin, Don.

29:00.624 --> 29:03.025
- Faith.
- You got me there.

29:03.026 --> 29:07.097
But dredging the ocean floor's an operation
that's way out of our budget range.

29:07.098 --> 29:10.966
<i>I'd say our current resources are
best suited for land excavation.</i>

29:10.967 --> 29:12.869
Don, this is hard.

29:12.870 --> 29:15.772
Oh, this is tough. I
got a jumble of thoughts

29:15.773 --> 29:17.440
just going on like there's a fog.

29:17.441 --> 29:19.877
Like Lucifer has farted inside my brain.

29:21.144 --> 29:22.712
<i>Well, what sort of, uh,</i>

29:22.713 --> 29:24.553
artifacts do you think
will be more reasonable?

29:25.917 --> 29:29.054
Well, there's one object
that's eluded me for years.

29:30.521 --> 29:32.789
I'm goin' after...

29:32.790 --> 29:35.193
the Goliath skull.

29:36.194 --> 29:37.862
<i>That is brilliant.</i>

29:38.662 --> 29:40.030
<i>Goliath's skull.</i>

29:40.031 --> 29:43.733
Don, I'm gonna get you some SkyMiles

29:43.734 --> 29:46.805
and we're gonna get you to Israel.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.907
You know about the road to Jericho?

29:50.908 --> 29:53.109
- No, I don't.
- Well, it's a long story.

29:53.110 --> 29:55.678
I don't want to get into it right
now, but the Valley of Kidron

29:55.679 --> 29:58.849
and the Valley of Josaphat...
I'm stuck between left and right.

30:21.671 --> 30:24.006
So, Carol, is this your first time

30:24.007 --> 30:26.210
in the Valley of Elah?

30:31.047 --> 30:35.051
Okay, right now we're
standing in the very creek bed

30:35.052 --> 30:38.522
where David collected his five stones.

30:38.523 --> 30:43.126
That means the Philistine army
would have camped over here

30:43.127 --> 30:45.594
and the Israelites would have camped...

30:45.595 --> 30:47.597
over there.

30:47.598 --> 30:49.099
Yeah.

30:49.100 --> 30:51.635
Yeah. Yeah.

30:51.636 --> 30:53.171
Yeah.

31:10.921 --> 31:12.621
Military protocol of the day

31:12.622 --> 31:14.323
would put David and Goliath somewhere

31:14.324 --> 31:16.860
right here in the middle.

31:16.861 --> 31:19.094
To pinpoint a more exact location,

31:19.095 --> 31:20.696
you go stand over there, Boaz.

31:20.697 --> 31:23.166
Let's see how this thing
would've played out.

31:26.704 --> 31:29.841
You better not sling that rock at me, Don.

31:30.841 --> 31:32.309
This will give us a general area

31:32.310 --> 31:35.844
of where they might have buried the skull.

31:35.845 --> 31:40.617
<i>Hold that shovel above your
head so I have about six cubits.</i>

31:40.618 --> 31:43.753
Now, if I'm David, I'm
thinkin', "I've got to swing

31:43.754 --> 31:46.590
this contraption as hard as I can.

31:46.591 --> 31:49.258
I'm probably only gonna
get one chance at this."

31:49.259 --> 31:51.761
<i>And then David begins to pray</i>

31:51.762 --> 31:53.263
for a kill shot right between

31:53.264 --> 31:56.733
the Philistine's eyes.

31:56.734 --> 31:58.200
<i>Carol!</i>

31:58.201 --> 32:00.270
Carol!

32:00.271 --> 32:02.171
Are you all right?

32:02.172 --> 32:05.207
- You hit her in the uterus, Don.
- I am so sorry, Carol.

32:05.208 --> 32:08.011
The sling just fell apart on me

32:08.012 --> 32:10.746
it's... it's... it's clearly
not a reliable weapon.

32:10.747 --> 32:12.849
- Can you breathe?
- Yeah.

32:12.850 --> 32:15.586
Well, let's all gather
'round for a word of prayer.

32:16.387 --> 32:18.156
Okay.

32:22.159 --> 32:24.660
Dear Lord, we are indeed grateful

32:24.661 --> 32:26.096
that Carol's flesh was not harmed.

32:26.097 --> 32:27.897
Bless her with renewed vigor.

32:27.898 --> 32:31.767
We pray, Lord, that when I throw
this river stone in the air,

32:31.768 --> 32:34.004
that it may land in the general area

32:34.005 --> 32:36.171
of where we should begin to dig,

32:36.172 --> 32:39.208
that we might be able to locate the remains

32:39.209 --> 32:40.944
of that heartless Philistine.

32:40.945 --> 32:44.482
Yay, even Goliath. Amen.

32:47.284 --> 32:49.319
All right, there she is.

32:49.320 --> 32:51.155
Let's start diggin'.

33:07.405 --> 33:09.673
"Remember, my child, I
never said it would be easy,

33:09.674 --> 33:11.142
I only said it would be worth it."

33:12.075 --> 33:14.878
Our Lord and Savior said that.

33:14.879 --> 33:16.879
I know you people don't
respect him as a deity,

33:16.880 --> 33:19.815
so I figured you may have missed
one of his best one-liners.

33:24.988 --> 33:28.190
Hey! Hey!

33:30.093 --> 33:31.327
Stay cool, I'll handle this.

33:33.229 --> 33:35.632
<i>Shabbat shalom.</i>

33:37.435 --> 33:39.936
- Mazel tov. Mazel tov.
- He says it's illegal to dig here.

33:39.937 --> 33:42.405
Why are you digging here?

33:42.406 --> 33:44.006
He said, "Shut your face, you."

33:44.007 --> 33:45.809
Hey!

33:47.178 --> 33:48.777
Well, I was told to pack a shovel

33:48.778 --> 33:51.414
when touring these parts
in case of inclement bowels.

33:51.415 --> 33:52.881
No toilets anywhere.

33:55.419 --> 33:56.985
He says you can't come here

33:56.986 --> 33:59.188
to our country and bury your caca.

34:05.763 --> 34:07.429
You need a government permit to dig here.

34:12.436 --> 34:14.938
If we don't put it back, everybody to jail.

34:14.938 --> 34:16.371
Move!

34:16.371 --> 34:18.141
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

34:18.141 --> 34:21.411
There's no need for that.

34:21.411 --> 34:24.047
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

34:25.882 --> 34:29.252
We will return everything
to exactly the way it was

34:29.253 --> 34:30.920
and be on our way.

34:32.889 --> 34:34.290
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

34:34.291 --> 34:36.995
<i>Thank you.</i>

35:02.787 --> 35:06.322
- This is Don.
- <i>Don, it's Tony. How are ya?</i>

35:06.323 --> 35:09.192
I'm good, Tony, I'm really... I'm good.

35:09.193 --> 35:11.995
How's everything goin' there? I just
really wanted to check up on your progress.

35:11.996 --> 35:13.797
You know, people are
chompin' at the bit here

35:13.798 --> 35:15.197
to see the head of that Philistine.

35:15.198 --> 35:17.967
Well, Tony, I...

35:17.968 --> 35:21.170
- we're gettin' close.
- Yeah, you think you'll be able

35:21.171 --> 35:22.806
to wrap it up there in the next day or two?

35:22.807 --> 35:24.809
I know your return trip is on Friday.

35:26.910 --> 35:30.480
Praise God, I think there's an 80% chance.

35:30.481 --> 35:33.982
Those odds have me a little worried, Don.

35:33.983 --> 35:36.819
Well, we've already
located the burial site.

35:36.820 --> 35:39.054
At this point, it's
just a matter of digging.

35:39.055 --> 35:41.123
Hmm. Okay.

35:41.124 --> 35:43.192
Well, I gotta be honest with you, Don,

35:43.193 --> 35:44.927
we need that skull.

35:44.928 --> 35:48.431
<i>The fate of thousands
of people's very souls</i>

35:48.432 --> 35:51.100
- <i>are in the balance here.</i>
- I understand that.

35:51.101 --> 35:53.837
<i>I mean, their fate is... is
barely hangin' on by a thread.</i>

35:53.838 --> 35:55.337
If they do not have this second witness,

35:55.338 --> 35:57.005
we could lose these people forever.

35:57.006 --> 35:58.810
Can you imagine that?

36:00.110 --> 36:02.110
I promise you, I will not return

36:02.111 --> 36:05.181
until I have Goliath's head in my carryon.

36:05.182 --> 36:07.951
All right. Well, I never doubted you, Don.

36:07.952 --> 36:09.853
Why don't you go ahead
and get some shut eye?

36:09.854 --> 36:12.054
I'm sure it's pretty late
over there in the Holy Land.

36:12.055 --> 36:13.922
Will do, Tony. Thank you.

36:13.923 --> 36:15.324
<i>God speed. Good night to you.</i>

37:11.314 --> 37:13.551
Come on, now.

37:19.356 --> 37:21.826
Please don't be cremated.

38:17.514 --> 38:21.984
Dear Lord, please forgive
me for what I'm about to do.

38:21.985 --> 38:25.989
And I know that someday
this man will be resurrected

38:25.990 --> 38:28.257
and his members will be made whole again.

38:28.258 --> 38:32.362
Until that day comes,
I pray that his remains

38:32.363 --> 38:34.230
will be put to good use

38:34.231 --> 38:37.400
and bring You many new souls unto Thee.

38:37.401 --> 38:39.403
Amen.

40:24.207 --> 40:27.542
- Hello?
<i>- Carol, I need you to wake up.</i>

40:27.543 --> 40:29.479
I'm up.

40:31.548 --> 40:33.516
<i>I was wrong about
our location yesterday.</i>

40:33.517 --> 40:35.417
<i>They never would've
buried Goliath there.</i>

40:35.418 --> 40:36.886
<i>It's just too obvious.</i>

40:36.887 --> 40:39.355
That police officer yesterday was God's way

40:39.356 --> 40:41.757
of telling us that we
were on the wrong path.

40:41.758 --> 40:44.127
Well, where could it be, then?

40:44.128 --> 40:47.464
Praise God, we'll find out.

40:55.305 --> 40:56.873
<i>What is this place?</i>

40:56.874 --> 40:58.574
This is the ancient village of Gath.

40:58.575 --> 41:00.442
Goliath's birthplace.

41:00.443 --> 41:03.212
We all need to keep our eyes
peeled for any natural landmarks...

41:03.213 --> 41:06.781
a... a monument of sorts.

41:06.782 --> 41:08.985
What about that monolith right there?

41:09.820 --> 41:12.623
- What monolith?
- Right there.

41:16.325 --> 41:19.529
That's not a bad idea.

41:19.530 --> 41:21.665
All right, boys, let's head over there.

41:23.300 --> 41:25.368
Good thinkin' there, Carol.

41:25.369 --> 41:27.904
You have really great ideas, Carol.

41:32.508 --> 41:34.576
All right, Carol, this is your call.

41:34.577 --> 41:37.380
You take the lead on this one.

41:37.381 --> 41:39.714
Well, to me,

41:39.715 --> 41:41.417
this monolith represents

41:41.418 --> 41:43.652
the physical strength of Goliath.

41:43.653 --> 41:45.955
So, it only makes sense
that they would've used

41:45.956 --> 41:48.723
something like this as a grave marker.

41:48.724 --> 41:50.493
Dang, you're a natural.

41:50.494 --> 41:52.930
<i>Where should we start digging?</i>

41:54.865 --> 41:56.799
Right here.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.601
All right, boys, you heard the lady.

41:58.602 --> 41:59.803
Let's get to it.

42:01.371 --> 42:03.471
Everyone be careful. Most Philistine graves

42:03.472 --> 42:05.507
in this region are quite shallow.

42:05.508 --> 42:06.875
That being said, let's dig fast.

42:06.876 --> 42:09.078
Don't want any looky-loos showin' up.

42:15.651 --> 42:17.120
Don.

42:18.689 --> 42:20.522
I hit something.

42:20.523 --> 42:22.357
Okay. Ho, ho, ho... everyone stop.

42:22.358 --> 42:24.694
- Where is it?
- Right there.

42:29.633 --> 42:32.603
Carol, can you hand me
that brush from my kit?

42:34.771 --> 42:38.074
- I can see a chunk of bone.
- Let's not get carried away.

42:44.347 --> 42:46.382
Ooh! Is that the dome of a skull?!

42:46.383 --> 42:48.650
Phew. Certainly appears that way.

42:48.651 --> 42:50.888
Wow.

42:53.289 --> 42:54.889
<i>Carol, would you do the honors?</i>

42:54.890 --> 42:56.826
No, I'm afraid I'll break it. You do it.

42:56.827 --> 42:58.694
All right, next time.

42:58.695 --> 43:00.498
Get that bag ready.

43:09.439 --> 43:11.609
Oh, my God.

43:14.577 --> 43:16.679
I don't believe it. That's...

43:16.680 --> 43:18.082
the skull of Goliath.

43:19.615 --> 43:22.784
Hey! Hey! T-these guys just
found the skull of Goliath!

43:22.785 --> 43:24.622
All right. Let's get out of here.

43:33.963 --> 43:35.964
<i>Can I come in, Don?</i>

43:35.965 --> 43:38.268
<i>Sure. What can I do you for?</i>

43:42.372 --> 43:45.841
I was just thinking about the
incredible discovery we made today.

43:45.842 --> 43:48.710
Another big win for Christianity, huh?

43:48.711 --> 43:50.446
Your people, too.

43:50.447 --> 43:52.348
You should be proud of
yourself. <i>Shalom.</i>

43:52.349 --> 43:54.949
<i>Your shovel made first contact.</i>

43:54.950 --> 43:56.851
I guess you're right.

43:56.852 --> 44:00.556
<i>I just found it a
little strange that...</i>

44:00.557 --> 44:02.424
we found the skull

44:02.425 --> 44:05.728
in the very first place we started digging.

44:05.729 --> 44:08.998
<i>My brother and I both agree
that that ground felt very soft.</i>

44:08.999 --> 44:12.734
Almost like somebody had already dug it up.

44:12.735 --> 44:15.438
I'm sure you can guess where
I'm going with this, Don.

44:15.439 --> 44:17.772
No, Boaz. Actually, I don't.

44:17.773 --> 44:21.743
Oh, don't you? It just seemed a
bit convenient, don't you think?

44:21.744 --> 44:25.413
What we experienced today is
nothing short of a miracle.

44:25.414 --> 44:28.083
Don't ever forget that.
God has always said,

44:28.084 --> 44:30.719
<i>"My ways are not your ways."</i>

44:34.523 --> 44:36.692
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey.
- What the hell?

44:36.693 --> 44:38.761
- Hey, hey, hey. Mind your business.
- What is wrong with you?!

44:38.762 --> 44:40.763
You sick, sick man, Don.

44:40.764 --> 44:43.866
Easy, now, Boaz. Let's... let's
talk about this, all right?

44:43.867 --> 44:45.368
No, there's nothing to talk about.

44:45.369 --> 44:46.935
You're a grave robbing creep!

44:46.936 --> 44:50.538
<i>Dismembering the head
of Johnny Jerusalem?!</i>

44:50.539 --> 44:52.708
Johnny Jerusalem is a hero here!

44:52.709 --> 44:55.411
Listen to me now, Boaz!

44:55.412 --> 44:57.380
I was always gonna put him back.

44:57.381 --> 44:59.047
Give him the proper hero's burial,

44:59.048 --> 45:02.384
but you need to understand
why I had to do this.

45:02.385 --> 45:05.554
<i>I-I-I'm doin' it for
the good of everyone.</i>

45:05.555 --> 45:08.591
I should report you to
the authorities right now.

45:08.592 --> 45:10.926
Let's not be rash here.

45:10.927 --> 45:14.163
I'm sure there's somethin'
we can work out between us.

45:14.164 --> 45:15.797
You trying to bribe me, Don?

45:15.798 --> 45:18.167
<i>I don't want your filthy</i> luka.

45:18.168 --> 45:20.703
Well, wh... what do you want?

45:22.572 --> 45:24.540
I want to come to the States.

45:24.541 --> 45:27.842
<i>I want to live the
American Dream for a while.</i>

45:27.843 --> 45:31.114
And get a Pontiac.

45:32.448 --> 45:34.817
And I want the Levi's jeans,

45:34.818 --> 45:37.819
acid wash, super taper.

45:37.820 --> 45:40.889
<i>Like John Stamos.</i>

45:40.890 --> 45:44.592
I want a wife, Don. I'm lonely here.

45:44.593 --> 45:47.830
<i>She has to be gentle</i>

45:47.831 --> 45:52.667
and sweet and hot like stripper.

45:52.668 --> 45:55.438
Well, that can be arranged.

45:55.439 --> 45:56.971
But on one condition, now.

45:56.972 --> 45:59.507
<i>I need you to bear
witness to the skull.</i>

45:59.508 --> 46:02.645
You're gonna have to be
a part of this for a bit.

46:02.646 --> 46:04.513
Maybe even share how the experience

46:04.514 --> 46:06.748
has caused you to consider Christianity,

46:06.749 --> 46:09.585
<i>but you're still on the
fence about the whole ordeal.</i>

46:09.586 --> 46:13.656
Christians love hearin' that
thing from a real-live Jew.

46:13.657 --> 46:17.227
<i>What do you say? Do we have a deal?</i>

46:22.499 --> 46:25.835
You better start lining up
some hot chicks for me, Don.

46:26.769 --> 46:28.705
<i>Amen.</i>

46:48.124 --> 46:50.759
<i>Hey, t-these guys
just found the skull of Goliath!</i>

46:50.760 --> 46:52.261
Let's get out of here.

46:52.262 --> 46:54.496
One of those tourists
uploaded it this morning.

46:54.497 --> 46:56.531
It already has over 1,000 views.

46:56.532 --> 46:58.766
Let's hope the authorities don't
see it before we're airborne.

46:58.767 --> 47:00.636
Put that away.

47:00.637 --> 47:03.638
They got a lot of undercovers
on these Jew planes.

47:06.108 --> 47:07.942
Stick it below the seat in front of ya.

47:07.943 --> 47:10.012
Sorry, Carol.

47:11.881 --> 47:13.882
Keep a close eye on it. Be gentle, now.

47:19.789 --> 47:21.959
I think it's broken.

47:25.227 --> 47:28.864
If Satan can get in there and get
you to start your day off wrong,

47:28.865 --> 47:31.065
he's gonna do it. Trust me.

47:31.066 --> 47:33.801
And he's gonna do it
through breakfast cereal.

47:33.802 --> 47:35.804
Kay?

47:35.805 --> 47:38.841
<i>Listen to some of the deviant
names of these cereals.</i>

47:38.842 --> 47:42.076
Grape-Nuts.

47:42.077 --> 47:44.078
Grape-Nuts!

47:44.079 --> 47:46.315
Nice try, Satan.

47:46.316 --> 47:49.618
Nuts, testicles.

47:49.619 --> 47:52.987
Come on. Don't get that image
in my head in the morning.

47:52.988 --> 47:55.991
Banana Nut Crunch.

47:55.992 --> 47:58.594
Yeah, we know what the nuts
are, we've established that.

47:58.595 --> 48:00.763
Bananas?

48:00.764 --> 48:02.864
We know what that is.

48:02.865 --> 48:04.433
It's a penis.

48:05.936 --> 48:08.002
Well, I'm here to tell you
that each and every time

48:08.003 --> 48:10.572
you spoon into a bowl of Lucky Charms,

48:10.573 --> 48:14.909
you might as well be partaking
of Lucifer's sacrament.

48:14.910 --> 48:17.279
<i>I mean, come on!</i>

48:17.280 --> 48:21.150
Turn it around! Let's get God cereal in ya!

48:21.151 --> 48:23.985
Start the day off with a
little God in your life.

48:23.986 --> 48:25.888
You know what I eat?

48:25.889 --> 48:28.022
I eat Life.

48:28.023 --> 48:30.359
I eat Raisin Bran.

48:30.360 --> 48:32.995
I eat Special K.

48:32.996 --> 48:34.996
Right? Special K.

48:34.997 --> 48:37.098
Come... come
right now. It's on TV.

48:37.099 --> 48:39.000
Oh. Brothers and sisters,

48:39.001 --> 48:41.404
let's all take a 15-minute recess.

48:45.140 --> 48:49.145
Fontaine, I'm tellin' you, you
could really be screwed here, man.

48:52.916 --> 48:55.917
Ladies and
gentlemen, members of the press,

48:55.918 --> 48:57.920
<i>at this time, I would
like to introduce to you</i>

48:57.921 --> 49:00.121
<i>the people sitting here to my left.</i>

49:00.122 --> 49:03.625
First we have Boaz Yohalem,

49:03.626 --> 49:06.194
field supervisor and Israeli national.

49:06.195 --> 49:07.962
<i>Next to him Carol Jensen,</i>

49:07.963 --> 49:09.964
<i>chief research assistant.</i>

49:09.965 --> 49:11.833
And, finally,

49:11.834 --> 49:14.402
world-famous archaeologist,
Donald Verdean.

49:14.403 --> 49:18.107
<i>Mr. Verdean is also
the president and CEO</i>

49:18.108 --> 49:22.076
of BibleQuest Enterprises,
headquartered in Duchesne, Utah.

49:22.077 --> 49:24.313
Now, at this time, I'd
like to hand the floor over

49:24.314 --> 49:26.348
to Mr. Verdean so he can share with you

49:26.349 --> 49:28.884
<i>the evidence of his latest find.</i>

49:28.885 --> 49:31.020
I'm gonna book you a massage right now.

49:33.023 --> 49:34.355
<i>Earlier this month</i>

49:34.356 --> 49:36.158
on a routine dig in Israel,

49:36.159 --> 49:38.661
Miss Jensen, Mr. Yohalem

49:38.662 --> 49:40.395
and myself unearthed the remains

49:40.396 --> 49:42.964
of a very large human skull

49:42.965 --> 49:44.400
containing a river stone

49:44.401 --> 49:47.402
embedded in the frontonasal suture.

49:47.403 --> 49:49.672
This discovery was made in Gath,

49:49.673 --> 49:52.341
the ancient birthplace of Goliath.

49:52.342 --> 49:55.677
And I'm gonna quit talkin' about it

49:55.678 --> 49:57.446
and let you be the judge.

50:03.787 --> 50:06.121
<i>- Mr. Verdean, how tall was he?
- Question. Question.</i>

50:06.122 --> 50:07.255
<i>- Over here.
- Question right here, Mr. Verdean.</i>

50:07.256 --> 50:08.723
I want you to find the home addresses

50:08.724 --> 50:11.125
of everyone involved in this broadcast.

50:11.126 --> 50:12.995
And I want you to go to their homes

50:12.996 --> 50:15.998
and put a dead dog in
each one of their cars.

50:15.999 --> 50:18.000
<i>First question, right over here.</i>

50:18.001 --> 50:19.400
How do you respond to critics

50:19.401 --> 50:22.237
who claim this is all a big hoax?

50:22.238 --> 50:23.739
Well, I invite critics everywhere

50:23.740 --> 50:25.473
to take a good, hard look at the evidence

50:25.474 --> 50:28.143
<i>and, uh, make a decision.</i>

50:28.144 --> 50:31.746
Bone shavings from the skull
will soon be taken to the lab

50:31.747 --> 50:33.348
for radio carbon analysis.

50:33.349 --> 50:36.719
So you see, it's all scientific.

50:36.720 --> 50:38.786
Tell them the truth, Don.

50:41.423 --> 50:43.693
What?

50:45.128 --> 50:48.065
I think you should really tell the truth.

50:52.434 --> 50:55.170
Tell them how we were chased

50:55.171 --> 50:58.940
by three al-Qaeda
guys on "motorcyc-les."

51:01.910 --> 51:05.179
Oh, yeah, well, I-I tried
to forget about that.

51:05.180 --> 51:09.352
- It was, uh...
- Will you please tell us about this run-in with al-Qaeda?

51:10.186 --> 51:11.386
Uh...

51:12.889 --> 51:14.822
<i>well, yes, as you already know</i>

51:14.823 --> 51:17.826
word of our discovery spread
quickly and not 10 minutes after

51:17.827 --> 51:19.460
<i>we were on the road with the skull,</i>

51:19.461 --> 51:23.464
we were followed by three
masked men on motorcycles...

51:23.465 --> 51:25.199
<i>With AK-47s.</i>

51:25.200 --> 51:27.502
<i>...with AK-47s. Uh...</i>

51:27.503 --> 51:29.505
I immediately took evasive action

51:29.506 --> 51:31.773
and I knocked all three
of them off the road.

51:31.774 --> 51:35.476
What al-Qaeda would want with the skull

51:35.477 --> 51:38.313
of a Philistine, I have no idea.

51:38.314 --> 51:40.348
They're possibly cloning

51:40.349 --> 51:44.085
an army of giant al-Qaeda guys.

51:44.086 --> 51:46.087
Uh...

51:46.088 --> 51:48.290
What makes you think
they were from al-Qaeda?

51:49.793 --> 51:51.560
Well, I've received numerous death threats

51:51.561 --> 51:54.228
since the incident that, uh...

51:54.229 --> 51:56.397
confirm they were indeed

51:56.398 --> 51:59.635
al-Qaeda operatives.

52:01.236 --> 52:04.172
Indeed they had... were
wearing those crazy hats.

52:04.173 --> 52:07.308
- Thank you, Dan.
<i>- Now, I tell ya, if I had my druthers,</i>

52:07.309 --> 52:09.812
<i>the very next thing
we'd be goin' after...</i>

52:09.813 --> 52:12.114
the wreckage of Noah's vessel.

52:12.115 --> 52:14.850
I'm not talkin' about the Ark, there
was this... an earlier prototype.

52:14.851 --> 52:16.518
It's more of a recreational vehicle.

52:16.519 --> 52:20.054
I believe his boys wrecked
it across a rocky shore

52:20.055 --> 52:21.522
when they were gallivanting one evening.

52:21.523 --> 52:23.391
If I can put that piece
of the puzzle together,

52:23.392 --> 52:26.527
I can finally close the door
on all this dinosaur nonsense,

52:26.528 --> 52:28.529
prove that that stuff never existed.

52:28.530 --> 52:30.531
Just a hodgepodge of
different reptilian bones.

52:30.532 --> 52:33.000
I'm sure if you're
familiar with the old, uh,

52:33.001 --> 52:35.370
'80s cartoon "Vultron."

52:35.371 --> 52:37.105
Familiar with that? I believe they were

52:37.106 --> 52:38.507
crime-fighters of some nature.

52:38.508 --> 52:40.275
They all had their own machines,

52:40.276 --> 52:43.145
but together the machines
would form a giant machine.

52:43.146 --> 52:46.080
And I do believe that that
is what we can discover.

52:46.081 --> 52:47.616
That these bones, these relics,

52:47.617 --> 52:49.884
they're just like a little
Vultron of reptilians.

52:49.885 --> 52:53.955
It was all tiny ones kinda
fell together to form something

52:53.956 --> 52:55.758
that looks like a creature.

52:58.026 --> 53:02.063
- Have I lost ya?
- Appreciate you bein' here.

53:02.064 --> 53:03.531
Right.

53:03.532 --> 53:05.568
Well...

53:07.470 --> 53:10.471
Hey, Carol. How you holdin' up?

53:10.472 --> 53:12.440
Boy, I'm sure you're not used to

53:12.441 --> 53:13.875
this much limelight, though.

53:13.876 --> 53:15.576
You really glowed up there today.

53:15.577 --> 53:17.645
Stop it, Don.

53:17.646 --> 53:21.049
Did you plan that
publicity stunt with Boaz?

53:21.050 --> 53:23.585
What? No, no, no.

53:23.586 --> 53:25.453
Because I would like to
be forewarned the next time

53:25.454 --> 53:28.491
you decide to lie to the
entire Christian nation.

53:32.327 --> 53:33.962
Carol, I-I'm... I'm sorry,

53:33.963 --> 53:36.931
but Boaz caught me totally off-guard.

53:36.932 --> 53:38.500
I-I-I didn't
know what to say,

53:38.501 --> 53:40.368
so I just rolled with it.

53:40.369 --> 53:43.438
<i>But I sure as heck didn't
ask him to lie for me.</i>

53:45.240 --> 53:46.574
Well, you know, in life I had to learn

53:46.575 --> 53:49.210
<i>that sometimes the small untruths</i>

53:49.211 --> 53:51.112
<i>are necessary for the greater good.</i>

53:51.113 --> 53:53.080
My sentiments exactly.

53:53.081 --> 53:55.951
But you know the second those
lies hurt the ones you love,

53:55.952 --> 53:58.321
the sin is on you.

54:03.258 --> 54:07.496
He also was in the Masad training
program for about three months.

54:07.497 --> 54:10.364
<i>Weapons training,
counter-intelligence,</i>

54:10.365 --> 54:12.366
making booby-traps,

54:12.367 --> 54:14.469
- kicking...
- Would you excuse us for just a moment?

54:14.470 --> 54:15.703
I just want to talk

54:15.704 --> 54:18.005
to Dr. Yohalum for a second.

54:18.006 --> 54:19.975
- I'm just talking to the lady about the...
- Yes. Yes.

54:19.976 --> 54:22.109
What in the Sam Hill were
you thinkin' in there?!

54:22.110 --> 54:24.379
Al-Qaeda, Boaz?! Cloning?!

54:24.380 --> 54:27.549
You don't know a damn heck thing
about the media, do you, Don?

54:27.550 --> 54:30.518
I was saving you up
there! You were suffering.

54:30.519 --> 54:34.121
Those people were bored, they were yawning.

54:34.122 --> 54:36.525
They couldn't give a rat's butthole

54:36.526 --> 54:40.194
about your Goliath skull
until I mentioned al-Qaeda.

54:40.195 --> 54:41.996
We're front page news now.

54:41.997 --> 54:43.998
Everybody wants a piece of us.

54:43.999 --> 54:47.703
Piece of you. Piece of
me. Piece of all of us.

54:47.704 --> 54:49.737
This is my operation, Boaz.

54:49.738 --> 54:52.641
Anything you say or do
need to run by me first!

54:52.642 --> 54:55.743
- You understand?
- Do you understand that we're partners now?

54:55.744 --> 54:59.580
I've started drumming up some
business from some new clients.

54:59.581 --> 55:04.152
- What?!
- We should cut bait with this... this Tony guy.

55:04.153 --> 55:08.556
We could be making serious
<i>luka</i> from big-time collectors.

55:08.557 --> 55:11.426
No, no, no, no. Hold on.
That's not why I do this.

55:11.427 --> 55:15.330
A Chinese billionaire
emailed me two minutes ago.

55:15.331 --> 55:17.565
He wants to finance us.

55:17.566 --> 55:20.569
I told him we're onto something big, Don.

55:20.570 --> 55:23.038
Something really big.

55:23.039 --> 55:26.910
The Holy Grail of Biblical artifacts.

55:28.711 --> 55:30.578
And what might that be?

55:30.579 --> 55:34.181
The Holy Grail.

55:34.182 --> 55:36.717
You're an idiot. Are you jokin' me?

55:36.718 --> 55:38.719
I'm not a joking you, Don.

55:38.720 --> 55:43.759
And apparently he just
leaked that to the press.

55:46.796 --> 55:50.031
Well, you've just turned
this into a royal crap storm.

55:50.032 --> 55:52.500
How in the heck are we gonna find that?!

55:52.501 --> 55:55.536
The same way we found the
Goliath skull, I guess.

55:55.537 --> 55:57.873
We fabricate it.

56:02.477 --> 56:04.312
Don't walk away from this, Don.

56:06.148 --> 56:08.817
I'm the one who knows
your dirty little secret.

56:20.463 --> 56:22.763
Don! Hold on. Let me
holler at you for a moment.

56:22.764 --> 56:24.799
Hey, Tony, hey. How are ya?

56:24.800 --> 56:27.069
What's going on? I-I just
talked to a reporter in there.

56:27.070 --> 56:29.371
He said you were thinkin'
about jumpin' ship?

56:29.372 --> 56:31.908
Go work for some Chinese
billionaire. That's not true, is it?

56:33.443 --> 56:36.578
Tony, I don't know what to say.

56:36.579 --> 56:38.647
- <i>A lot of big things have happened today.</i>
- All right, well,

56:38.648 --> 56:40.214
what's he offering you? You gotta give me

56:40.215 --> 56:41.984
the opportunity to match his offer.

56:43.418 --> 56:45.487
Well, Tony, I...

56:48.124 --> 56:51.259
I'm sorry, Tony, I never
planned it to happen like this,

56:51.260 --> 56:53.661
<i>but...</i>

56:53.662 --> 56:57.565
This is just too big an
opportunity to pass up.

56:57.566 --> 57:00.101
You know, I don't believe this.

57:00.102 --> 57:01.435
I thought you and I were friends.

57:01.436 --> 57:04.138
Real soldiers in the Lord's army.

57:04.139 --> 57:06.875
But you've turned out
to be a Judas Iscariot

57:09.412 --> 57:11.279
- Wait, Tony, I...
- Good day to you, sir.

57:11.280 --> 57:13.616
Tony, my hands are tied here! I...

57:24.860 --> 57:28.330
There are a few items of business
I want to discuss with you.

57:28.331 --> 57:30.531
- Keep your voice down.
- All right.

57:30.532 --> 57:31.866
First item,

57:31.867 --> 57:34.335
if you're worried about the analysis

57:34.336 --> 57:36.237
of the Goliath skull, don't be.

57:36.238 --> 57:38.640
Boaz has taken care of it.

57:40.443 --> 57:43.277
- Excuse me?
- <i>I offered the lab tech guy</i>

57:43.278 --> 57:45.848
10 grand to fake the results.

57:47.849 --> 57:50.752
- You just what?
- Don't worry about the money, Don.

57:50.753 --> 57:54.589
I'll take care of that, too.
I'm gonna negotiate an advance

57:54.590 --> 57:57.259
when we have our Skype
call with Poon-Yen tomorrow.

57:57.260 --> 57:59.326
Who's Poon-Yen?

57:59.327 --> 58:02.730
- <i>Poon-Yen.</i>
- That's what I said. Poon-Yen.

58:02.731 --> 58:05.866
No, you said Poon-Yen,
it's Poon-Yen.

58:05.867 --> 58:08.335
<i>He's the Chinese
guy that's paying us</i>

58:08.336 --> 58:09.871
to find the Holy Grail.

58:09.872 --> 58:12.675
<i>Second item of business,</i>

58:14.776 --> 58:17.680
I want one night with Carol.

58:21.450 --> 58:22.884
Absolutely not.

58:22.885 --> 58:24.953
You offered to find me a wife, Don,

58:24.954 --> 58:26.554
that was part of the deal.

58:26.555 --> 58:28.757
<i>Just one night with Carol.</i>

58:28.758 --> 58:31.659
Not lovemaking, just dancing, talking,

58:31.660 --> 58:35.197
flirting, having fun.
Smelling each other's hair.

58:35.198 --> 58:37.232
Absolutely not. Carol's her own woman.

58:37.233 --> 58:39.366
I can't make her do anything.

58:39.367 --> 58:42.703
You and I both know that she'll do
just about anything for the cause.

58:42.704 --> 58:44.471
I need you to make this happen, Don.

58:44.472 --> 58:46.776
Don't forget about what's at stake here.

58:47.910 --> 58:49.377
<i>I'll see you 9:00 AM tomorrow</i>

58:49.378 --> 58:51.246
<i>for the Skype call with Poon-Yen.</i>

58:51.247 --> 58:54.684
Make up a good story about
where we find this Grail.

58:56.385 --> 58:58.587
Boaz.

58:59.588 --> 59:01.589
Boaz.

59:13.869 --> 59:16.237
- Hello?
- <i>Carol, it's Don.</i>

59:16.238 --> 59:18.706
- Hi.
- <i>Carol, I'm sure you've heard already,</i>

59:18.707 --> 59:20.708
<i>but I-I just wanna tell you myself.</i>

59:20.709 --> 59:22.576
<i>We're now being financed</i>

59:22.577 --> 59:24.679
<i>by a wealthy Christian
fellow from China.</i>

59:24.680 --> 59:27.248
<i>Oh, I know, it's all
over the Internet.</i>

59:27.249 --> 59:28.984
<i>What did Tony say?</i>

59:28.985 --> 59:31.920
Well, he didn't take very kindly to it,

59:31.921 --> 59:34.656
but, uh, we're still on the Lord's
errand and that's what matters.

59:34.657 --> 59:38.826
<i>Uh... uh, Carol, I had a great
conversation with Boaz today.</i>

59:38.827 --> 59:41.429
He was askin' me all
kinds of deep questions

59:41.430 --> 59:44.431
about Christianity and
the search for truth.

59:44.432 --> 59:47.268
I think he might be
interested in gettin' saved.

59:47.269 --> 59:49.571
<i>Really? Oh, that's wonderful.</i>

59:50.972 --> 59:52.873
<i>I was wonderin' if you might be able</i>

59:52.874 --> 59:54.708
<i>to spend some time with
him tomorrow night,</i>

59:54.709 --> 59:57.045
bear witness of your conversion story.

59:57.046 --> 01:00:00.382
I think that might help him get to
the finish line a little quicker.

01:00:00.383 --> 01:00:03.551
<i>Oh, absolutely! It
would be my pleasure!</i>

01:00:03.552 --> 01:00:06.453
<i>Thank you, Carol. Hallelujah.</i>

01:00:06.454 --> 01:00:09.723
<i>I'll go ahead and let him know. I'm sure
he'll look forward to hearin' your story.</i>

01:00:09.724 --> 01:00:12.794
- <i>Good night.</i>
- Oh, good night.

01:00:38.486 --> 01:00:40.755
Poon-Yen, hi.

01:00:40.756 --> 01:00:43.458
We realize your time is precious,

01:00:43.459 --> 01:00:45.627
so we're gonna get
straight to the business.

01:00:45.628 --> 01:00:48.462
My business partner's
right here. Don Verdean.

01:00:48.463 --> 01:00:50.364
Pleasure to meet ya, Poon-Yen.

01:00:50.365 --> 01:00:52.801
Hello, Don. I'm a big fan of your work.

01:00:52.802 --> 01:00:55.837
- I have all your DVD.
- Thank you.

01:00:55.838 --> 01:00:58.540
Uh, Don is going to
brief you on what he knows

01:00:58.541 --> 01:01:01.042
about the location of the Holy Grail.

01:01:01.043 --> 01:01:03.844
Uh, many people believe the Grail is buried

01:01:03.845 --> 01:01:06.047
on a booby-trapped
island off of Nova Scotia.

01:01:06.048 --> 01:01:09.484
<i>Even Franklin D. Roosevelt
blew a significant load of cash</i>

01:01:09.485 --> 01:01:12.520
tryin' to find it there, but the
Knights Templar were tricky fellows.

01:01:12.521 --> 01:01:15.790
Oh, yes, those... those damn bastards.

01:01:15.791 --> 01:01:18.125
But based on my study of
the Kensington Runestone,

01:01:18.126 --> 01:01:20.728
I believe I have a mountain of evidence

01:01:20.729 --> 01:01:25.065
<i>that places the Grail on an Indian
reservation in the American Southwest.</i>

01:01:25.066 --> 01:01:29.272
Oh, that's very interesting!
Which Indian reservation is it?

01:01:30.773 --> 01:01:33.674
Of course, that information is confidential

01:01:33.675 --> 01:01:36.143
until we've formally
entered into an agreement.

01:01:36.144 --> 01:01:38.078
That's right. Don's right.

01:01:38.079 --> 01:01:40.949
We're going to need a
substantial retainer fee

01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:44.685
um, before we can begin. For our services.

01:01:44.686 --> 01:01:47.855
Oh, uh, how much of my money do you want?

01:01:47.856 --> 01:01:50.759
Um, a million dollars sound okay?

01:01:53.528 --> 01:01:57.565
- A million dollars sounds okay.
- Sure... certainly be a start.

01:01:57.566 --> 01:02:00.067
So, when can we go look for the Grail?

01:02:00.068 --> 01:02:02.703
Well, give us a few days
to organize our game plan

01:02:02.704 --> 01:02:05.105
- and we'll call you.
- <i>Sound great!</i>

01:02:05.106 --> 01:02:07.574
Uh, so how will you be paying us?

01:02:07.575 --> 01:02:10.779
We've got a few urgent matters
we need to take care of.

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:14.114
Oh, when I fly out for the
dig, I will bring you cash.

01:02:14.115 --> 01:02:17.719
Is there any way that you could

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.721
wire us the money right now?

01:02:19.722 --> 01:02:22.489
Uh, maybe, I don't know, 10 grand to...

01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:25.460
<i>to hold us over till then?</i>

01:02:25.461 --> 01:02:26.895
I'm sorry. Can you say again?

01:02:26.896 --> 01:02:29.163
I can't understand you say. What you say?

01:02:29.164 --> 01:02:32.000
Oh, is there any way that you can wire us

01:02:32.001 --> 01:02:35.002
the money straight away? Like,
say, maybe 10 grand maybe?

01:02:35.003 --> 01:02:38.974
Your accent are very
strong. Can you say again?

01:02:40.608 --> 01:02:43.578
Is there any way you can wire us the money

01:02:43.579 --> 01:02:46.214
straight away, maybe? Just to tide us over.

01:02:46.215 --> 01:02:48.850
Perhaps, about 10 grand?

01:02:50.686 --> 01:02:54.121
Hey, no problem. I'll just, uh...
send me your bank account number.

01:02:54.122 --> 01:02:57.958
Okay, thank you. We'll
do that straight away.

01:02:57.959 --> 01:03:01.529
Okay, fantastic. Uh, goodbye, gentlemen.

01:03:04.967 --> 01:03:08.236
And that is what I'm talking about.

01:03:10.206 --> 01:03:13.475
Ooh, <i>shalom!</i>

01:03:36.831 --> 01:03:39.199
Ah, good evening, Carol.

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.668
You're lookin' very nice.

01:03:41.669 --> 01:03:44.638
Oh, Boaz.

01:03:44.639 --> 01:03:47.074
I didn't know this was a formal event.

01:03:47.075 --> 01:03:49.210
Just a little bit of light dancing

01:03:49.211 --> 01:03:51.813
and maybe some cocktails for two.

01:03:51.814 --> 01:03:54.214
I brought you an outfit.

01:03:54.215 --> 01:03:57.753
Where we're going has a strict dress code.

01:03:59.521 --> 01:04:02.390
Okay, I just need a minute.

01:04:04.559 --> 01:04:05.826
Can I...

01:04:14.068 --> 01:04:15.837
<i>Wow.</i>

01:04:15.838 --> 01:04:18.174
You look great!

01:04:36.057 --> 01:04:39.860
So, Carol, I've been meaning
to ask you since I met you

01:04:39.861 --> 01:04:42.663
what qualities are you
looking for in a mate?

01:04:42.664 --> 01:04:45.567
Oh, um...

01:04:45.568 --> 01:04:47.768
I'm sorry, Boaz,

01:04:47.769 --> 01:04:52.739
I was under the impression you had
some questions about Jesus of Nazareth.

01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:54.875
Oh, yeah.

01:04:54.876 --> 01:04:57.612
What is it that you like about that guy?

01:04:57.613 --> 01:05:00.214
Well, um...

01:05:00.215 --> 01:05:03.917
he was kind, handsome,

01:05:03.918 --> 01:05:05.687
merciful,

01:05:05.688 --> 01:05:08.121
forgiving.

01:05:08.122 --> 01:05:10.857
He's the perfect man.

01:05:10.858 --> 01:05:15.064
So, I guess, that's what
I'm looking for in somebody.

01:05:16.965 --> 01:05:18.699
Looks like your Lord and me

01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:21.201
have a lot in common.

01:05:21.202 --> 01:05:23.770
We grew up in the same neighborhood

01:05:23.771 --> 01:05:25.873
and we walked the same streets

01:05:25.874 --> 01:05:28.578
under the same sunshine.

01:05:30.111 --> 01:05:31.779
E-excuse me?

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:35.518
We're both Jewish guys.

01:05:37.285 --> 01:05:39.388
Shall we dance?

01:06:23.698 --> 01:06:25.667
So, Carol, tell me

01:06:25.668 --> 01:06:26.967
do you want children?

01:06:26.968 --> 01:06:28.969
Your hips say that

01:06:28.970 --> 01:06:30.471
you can handle many.

01:06:32.407 --> 01:06:36.544
Oh, well, your hips do spread
a little after childbirth.

01:06:38.981 --> 01:06:42.585
- What?
- Oh, didn't Don tell you I have a son?

01:06:43.985 --> 01:06:47.721
He's at the Wayne County
Correctional Facility.

01:06:47.722 --> 01:06:49.723
Oh, he's in jail.

01:06:49.724 --> 01:06:52.928
So I won't have to provide for him.

01:06:54.896 --> 01:06:57.966
I don't want to provide for another's son.

01:07:01.003 --> 01:07:02.370
Carol, wait!

01:07:02.371 --> 01:07:04.971
Don promised me a night with you!

01:07:04.972 --> 01:07:07.975
Don't go! He promised me!

01:07:07.976 --> 01:07:09.409
Please!

01:07:09.410 --> 01:07:14.417
<i>♪ I'm here with you ♪</i>

01:07:16.017 --> 01:07:21.122
<i>♪ I'm here with you... ♪</i>

01:07:29.198 --> 01:07:31.132
<i>Carol, what on
Earth happened to you?</i>

01:07:31.133 --> 01:07:33.101
Are you all right?

01:07:33.102 --> 01:07:35.902
Oh, well, I see my pimp has
finally decided to check up on me.

01:07:35.903 --> 01:07:37.871
What are you talking about?

01:07:37.872 --> 01:07:40.208
You know what I'm talkin' about!

01:07:40.209 --> 01:07:43.344
One night with Boaz?!

01:07:43.345 --> 01:07:46.515
I'm no Potiphar's wife!

01:07:47.448 --> 01:07:50.851
I am so sorry, Carol. I-I...

01:07:50.852 --> 01:07:53.755
he just said he wanted
to get to know you better.

01:07:53.756 --> 01:07:57.125
- <i>Did he hurt you?</i>
- You know, Don, I think it's time you find yourself

01:07:57.126 --> 01:07:58.995
a new research assistant.

01:08:18.279 --> 01:08:21.180
You are a really great dancer.

01:08:21.182 --> 01:08:23.218
Aah!

01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:30.424
Ow!

01:08:30.425 --> 01:08:33.359
<i>Ow!</i>

01:08:33.361 --> 01:08:35.163
<i>Don!</i>

01:08:46.073 --> 01:08:48.109
Ooh!

01:08:52.514 --> 01:08:54.682
We've got a major problem.

01:08:56.917 --> 01:09:00.354
<i>I hate this guy, man. This
lab tech guy, I hate this guy.</i>

01:09:00.354 --> 01:09:02.488
<i>- He's a "dootchbag".
- What'd he say?</i>

01:09:02.490 --> 01:09:04.858
He says that the press
have been hounding him

01:09:04.859 --> 01:09:08.229
and hounding him and unless
he sees some money today...

01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:10.162
- he wants it in cash.
- Wait a minute.

01:09:10.163 --> 01:09:12.867
- You haven't paid him yet?!
- I haven't paid him because...

01:09:12.868 --> 01:09:15.336
- Oh!
- Poon-Yen hasn't paid me yet. Okay?

01:09:15.337 --> 01:09:18.037
So don't blame me, Don. Don't put it on me.

01:09:18.038 --> 01:09:20.006
How am I supposed to bring the money?

01:09:20.006 --> 01:09:22.176
Produce it from my anus?

01:09:37.426 --> 01:09:39.559
<i>I understand we
owe you some money.</i>

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.295
Hell, yeah, you do.

01:09:41.296 --> 01:09:43.029
Well, we apologize for the delay,

01:09:43.029 --> 01:09:45.366
our money's been tied up
in an offshore account,

01:09:45.367 --> 01:09:47.600
but if you give us another day
or two we'll double your offer

01:09:47.602 --> 01:09:49.537
<i>maybe even throw in a bucket
of chicken or somethin'.</i>

01:09:49.537 --> 01:09:51.604
I need cash now.

01:09:51.606 --> 01:09:53.974
<i>That was the deal.</i>

01:09:53.975 --> 01:09:55.443
If you can't make that happen,

01:09:55.444 --> 01:09:57.545
I'll send everyone the real results.

01:09:57.546 --> 01:10:00.081
- It's that simple.
<i>- We... we understand.</i>

01:10:00.082 --> 01:10:02.582
Okay, drop the phone.

01:10:02.583 --> 01:10:05.318
<i>- Oh, whoa. Boaz! What are you doing?
- Put the phone down.</i>

01:10:05.319 --> 01:10:07.054
<i>Do you think I'm
fooling around, creep?</i>

01:10:07.055 --> 01:10:09.590
I said drop the phone!

01:10:09.591 --> 01:10:11.458
<i>Boaz, put the gun down.</i>

01:10:11.459 --> 01:10:13.193
Please.

01:10:13.194 --> 01:10:14.929
Oh, my Lord.

01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:25.807
Get into the car.

01:10:28.409 --> 01:10:30.144
<i>Come on, get in the
trunk of the car.</i>

01:10:30.145 --> 01:10:32.212
<i>Get in the Fiero!</i>

01:10:32.213 --> 01:10:35.417
Just... see if you can fit in there.

01:10:38.419 --> 01:10:41.354
- Don, help get these...
- No! I'm not helpin' you do nothin'!

01:10:41.355 --> 01:10:43.256
Tuck your knees together, maybe.

01:10:43.257 --> 01:10:44.925
<i>You're gonna crush his skull.</i>

01:10:44.926 --> 01:10:46.226
<i>He's not gonna fit in there.</i>

01:10:46.227 --> 01:10:47.896
Put that gun away!

01:10:49.364 --> 01:10:52.166
Listen to me now, Boaz,
this just got real serious.

01:10:52.167 --> 01:10:55.638
You better tell me right now
what you plan to do with this guy.

01:11:08.249 --> 01:11:09.983
Make yourself comfortable.

01:11:09.984 --> 01:11:12.385
If you promise to stay
put for the next few days,

01:11:12.386 --> 01:11:14.188
you'll get 50 grand

01:11:14.189 --> 01:11:16.690
and we can all pretend
like this never happened.

01:11:16.691 --> 01:11:18.860
- Understand?
- Yeah, sure.

01:11:24.065 --> 01:11:27.201
<i>As I surveyed the landscape</i>

01:11:27.202 --> 01:11:29.502
<i>with our expedition
team, a large monolith</i>

01:11:29.503 --> 01:11:32.640
caught my attention,
and somethin' inside me

01:11:32.641 --> 01:11:35.275
just knew that's where
we had to start digging.

01:11:35.276 --> 01:11:38.712
So, following my lead, that
is precisely what we did.

01:11:38.713 --> 01:11:43.416
And within minutes, we unearthed the skull.

01:11:43.417 --> 01:11:46.287
It must have been the hand of
the Lord that guided us that day.

01:11:46.288 --> 01:11:49.290
I don't know how else to explain it.

01:11:49.291 --> 01:11:52.294
I understand
you've parted ways with Don Verdean.

01:11:54.363 --> 01:11:57.163
Would you mind explaining
what happened, exactly?

01:11:57.164 --> 01:11:59.433
<i>Well, after
a while, some people</i>

01:11:59.434 --> 01:12:02.269
start to chase money, I suppose.

01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:05.038
But I am here to promote the faith.

01:12:05.039 --> 01:12:09.510
Are you suggesting Don Verdean
made a pact with Lucifer, then?

01:12:09.511 --> 01:12:13.514
Uh, no, no. No, Don is
an honest, gentle man.

01:12:13.515 --> 01:12:15.683
<i>He would never side
with The Dark One.</i>

01:12:15.684 --> 01:12:18.887

help him find the Grail?

How stupid is this Poon-Yen guy?

01:14:12.167 --> 01:14:15.235
<i>We are now inviting
those passengers with small children</i>

01:14:15.236 --> 01:14:17.571
<i>and any passengers
requiring special assistance</i>

01:14:17.572 --> 01:14:19.806
<i>to begin boarding at this time.</i>

01:14:19.807 --> 01:14:23.309
<i>Please have your boarding
pass and identification ready.</i>

01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:27.214
<i>Regular boarding will begin in
approximately 10 minutes. Thank you.</i>

01:14:27.215 --> 01:14:29.215
<i>Ni hao ma.</i>

01:14:29.216 --> 01:14:30.717
How was your flight from the Orient, sir?

01:14:30.718 --> 01:14:33.621
It was fine. When do
we leave for the Grail?

01:14:33.622 --> 01:14:35.322
In 25 minutes.

01:14:35.323 --> 01:14:36.590
We chartered a helicopter to take us

01:14:36.591 --> 01:14:39.626
deep inside the Indian reservation.

01:14:39.627 --> 01:14:42.328
They'll set us down about one
click south of the Templar cave.

01:14:42.329 --> 01:14:44.331
Now, after that, we'll
have under three hours

01:14:44.332 --> 01:14:46.500
to penetrate the cave, locate the Grail,

01:14:46.501 --> 01:14:48.601
and rendezvous back at
our extraction point.

01:14:48.602 --> 01:14:50.203
You're gonna need to wear this.

01:14:50.204 --> 01:14:53.674
The cave is guarded 24/7
by Native American warriors,

01:14:53.675 --> 01:14:55.809
we don't wanna take any chances.

01:14:55.810 --> 01:14:57.746
All right, let's roll in!

01:15:07.756 --> 01:15:10.757
<i>I got five helicopters
just like this at home.</i>

01:15:10.758 --> 01:15:14.495
<i>I replaced all the engine
with Rolls Royce engine.</i>

01:15:14.496 --> 01:15:16.698
<i>That... that's
great, Poon-Yen.</i>

01:15:52.234 --> 01:15:54.367
Okay, so our latest intel

01:15:54.368 --> 01:15:57.537
says that the guards
work in 12-hour shifts.

01:15:57.538 --> 01:16:00.707
It takes them 15 minutes to
ride the horse out of the canyon

01:16:00.708 --> 01:16:04.377
<i>and another 15 for the
replacement guard to ride back.</i>

01:16:04.378 --> 01:16:07.747
By my calculations we
got a 30 minute window

01:16:07.748 --> 01:16:10.084
in which to fetch the Grail.

01:16:20.928 --> 01:16:23.231
Okay, now's our chance. Let's move.

01:16:26.501 --> 01:16:28.601
I can't believe
we're so close to the Grail.

01:16:28.602 --> 01:16:30.703
I can feel its power inside me!

01:16:30.704 --> 01:16:32.774
Well, hopefully,
we can all get a cell.

01:16:49.858 --> 01:16:51.660
All right.

01:16:53.461 --> 01:16:56.064
Better get them lanterns
on. We haven't much time.

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:09.243
All right. Let's sally forth.

01:17:28.329 --> 01:17:31.332
- Maybe we should pray.
- You bet.

01:17:31.333 --> 01:17:33.099
<i>That's a great idea. Um...</i>

01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:35.601
Why don't you take the lead on this one?

01:17:35.602 --> 01:17:37.604
Okay.

01:17:37.605 --> 01:17:39.605
Dear Lord,

01:17:39.606 --> 01:17:43.743
please guide us safely to
Your Holy Grail of wonders.

01:17:43.744 --> 01:17:45.778
We promise to take good care of it.

01:17:45.779 --> 01:17:47.948
Amen.

01:17:47.949 --> 01:17:49.849
- Amen. That was good.
- Amen.

01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:52.853
How you feelin'? We should get
that... you wanna power through?

01:17:54.989 --> 01:17:56.924
I feel that God is on our side.

01:17:56.925 --> 01:17:59.727
Well, let's sally forth, then.

01:18:46.708 --> 01:18:49.177
Poon-Yen, this is all you, buddy.

01:19:15.803 --> 01:19:18.240
It's more beautiful than I ever imagined.

01:19:19.974 --> 01:19:22.876
And to think that the lips of your Lord

01:19:22.877 --> 01:19:25.047
graced this very cup.

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.917
Plenty of time to examine
it later. Put it in here.

01:19:31.185 --> 01:19:32.885
Let's roll.

01:19:32.886 --> 01:19:34.823
<i>Come on. Let's go!</i>

01:19:44.097 --> 01:19:46.901
Head for the safety of the trees!

01:19:51.573 --> 01:19:53.172
They're shooting!

01:19:53.173 --> 01:19:56.009
Hurry! Hurry!

01:19:56.010 --> 01:19:57.478
Get down! Get down!

01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:02.384
<i>The Indian guys.
They're shooting at us!</i>

01:20:03.685 --> 01:20:05.652
Do they know we have the Grail?

01:20:05.653 --> 01:20:07.554
I think we're trapped.

01:20:07.555 --> 01:20:09.189
<i>What should we do?</i>

01:20:09.190 --> 01:20:10.957
<i>They won't stop shooting!</i>

01:20:14.061 --> 01:20:15.828
- I've been hit.
- Oh, no! Oh, no!

01:20:15.829 --> 01:20:17.930
Ow!

01:20:17.931 --> 01:20:19.632
- Oh, my God!
- It's bad.

01:20:19.633 --> 01:20:21.734
They must have hit an artery.

01:20:21.735 --> 01:20:24.203
- It's okay.
- I need a tourniquet or a bandage or...

01:20:24.204 --> 01:20:27.174
- tissue paper, anything!
- I'm sorry, Boaz,

01:20:27.175 --> 01:20:30.210
I-I-I think this will take
nothing short of a miracle.

01:20:30.211 --> 01:20:32.546
Oh! What about the Holy Grail?!

01:20:32.547 --> 01:20:35.815
Poon-Yen, fill the Grail with water.

01:20:35.816 --> 01:20:38.784
It contains the secret of eternal life.

01:20:38.785 --> 01:20:40.888
- I'll go fill 'er up.
- Stay calm.

01:20:40.889 --> 01:20:42.356
Just breathe.

01:20:44.859 --> 01:20:46.225
He's bleeding really bad.

01:20:46.226 --> 01:20:48.595
It hurts!

01:20:48.596 --> 01:20:50.229
Just focus on God.

01:20:55.703 --> 01:20:58.538
Hold still. This could hurt.

01:21:02.577 --> 01:21:05.245
<i>It's working!</i>

01:21:05.246 --> 01:21:07.249
Praise the Lord!

01:21:08.583 --> 01:21:12.318
I don't believe it because that...

01:21:12.319 --> 01:21:15.957
I was in pain and now it's all healed.

01:21:18.059 --> 01:21:20.126
It really is the Holy Grail!

01:21:20.127 --> 01:21:23.330
<i>- Hallelujah.</i>
- All right, let's go.

01:21:25.065 --> 01:21:28.167
Yeah, I think we still may have
time to make the rendezvous.

01:21:32.806 --> 01:21:34.274
Poon-Yen!

01:21:34.275 --> 01:21:36.710
<i>Hey! Cease fire! Cease fire!</i>

01:21:36.711 --> 01:21:38.644
I thought you told them to use blanks!

01:21:38.645 --> 01:21:41.148
They didn't have any blanks, I
told them to fire above our heads.

01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:44.917
Poon-Yen!

01:21:44.918 --> 01:21:47.821
<i>Dr. Odain, you're needed in Oncology.</i>

01:21:47.822 --> 01:21:50.091
<i>Dr. Odain in Oncology.</i>

01:21:53.093 --> 01:21:54.462
What did you tell them?

01:21:55.762 --> 01:21:58.065
I told them it was a hunting accident.

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:02.868
I wish that guy would
just hand over our money.

01:22:02.869 --> 01:22:04.871
We gave them the Grail,
what more do they want?

01:22:04.872 --> 01:22:07.174
- Shut up, Boaz.
- He can't understand me.

01:22:07.175 --> 01:22:08.908
<i>Can't speak English.</i>

01:22:08.909 --> 01:22:12.078
I should just stick him up
right now and done with it.

01:22:12.079 --> 01:22:13.846
Listen here, Boaz.

01:22:13.847 --> 01:22:16.983
You easily the stupidest man I've ever met.

01:22:16.984 --> 01:22:21.054
<i>Bringing you out here was the biggest
damn mistake of my entire life.</i>

01:22:21.055 --> 01:22:24.024
As soon as we pay off that
lab tech, you and I are done.

01:22:24.025 --> 01:22:26.792
I don't ever wanna see or hear from you

01:22:26.793 --> 01:22:29.396
ever again. You understand me?

01:22:36.938 --> 01:22:39.372
Let's just call it quits
right now, then. Shall we?

01:22:39.373 --> 01:22:41.675
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't do this.

01:22:41.676 --> 01:22:43.409
<i>Hold on, now.</i>

01:22:43.410 --> 01:22:45.345
<i>Don't do this, Boaz.</i>

01:22:45.346 --> 01:22:47.415
<i>Come on!</i>

01:22:48.916 --> 01:22:51.518
Good riddance, Don,
you washed up, old hack.

01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:58.058
Stay here.

01:22:58.059 --> 01:23:00.961
<i>Security
wanted in the parking lot three.</i>

01:23:21.248 --> 01:23:23.282
- Give me the case.
- No!

01:23:23.283 --> 01:23:26.318
- Give me the case!
- No, Don, no!

01:23:34.194 --> 01:23:36.064
Open it up.

01:23:53.413 --> 01:23:57.016
<i>Chang, it's me, Fontaine.</i>

01:23:57.017 --> 01:23:58.918
<i>You're not gonna believe this,
but the Sherriff's department</i>

01:23:58.919 --> 01:24:01.787
<i>just found the lab guy
locked up in a storage unit.</i>

01:24:01.788 --> 01:24:03.989
<i>The GPS I stuck on their
car led 'em right to him.</i>

01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:06.059
<i>So, I-I'm with the police.</i>

01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:08.161
<i>We're waiting for some backup
and then we'll be right over.</i>

01:24:08.162 --> 01:24:10.263
<i>Thank you so much for
your help with this.</i>

01:24:10.264 --> 01:24:12.200
<i>We got 'em.</i>

01:24:13.967 --> 01:24:16.538
We were set up.

01:24:19.106 --> 01:24:22.041
We were set up!

01:24:22.042 --> 01:24:25.010
<i>Poon-Yen was working for
Fontaine this whole time,</i>

01:24:25.011 --> 01:24:27.046
<i>and his name is Chang!</i>

01:24:27.047 --> 01:24:30.250
He doesn't have a billion dollars.

01:24:39.993 --> 01:24:41.528
They've been tracking us!

01:24:47.935 --> 01:24:49.802
You better hit the road, buddy.

01:24:49.803 --> 01:24:51.904
What about you? Where are you gonna go?

01:24:51.905 --> 01:24:54.241
It's better if we split up.

01:25:10.557 --> 01:25:14.161
Stupid bastard. Stupid, greedy bastard!

01:25:16.497 --> 01:25:19.177
<i>Ah, that's him! Go, go, go, go!</i>

01:25:20.368 --> 01:25:22.301
Oh, man.

01:25:22.302 --> 01:25:24.104
Oh, no!

01:25:24.105 --> 01:25:26.439
How do you do this? Is there a button or...

01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:28.375
Hello? Somebody?

01:25:28.376 --> 01:25:31.243
I'm in a-a police car
and we need a spike strip.

01:25:31.244 --> 01:25:33.180
<i>Get me snipers, get me SWAT.</i>

01:25:33.181 --> 01:25:35.916
<i>I want to set up a roadblock
from Kern to Hawthorne.</i>

01:25:35.917 --> 01:25:37.449
Can't you ram them or something?

01:25:37.450 --> 01:25:40.252
Let's see if you pigs can beat a Pontiac.

01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:44.190
<i>Main Street!
They're on Main Street!</i>

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:49.196
<i>We're only going 35?!
Come on, step on it!</i>

01:25:49.197 --> 01:25:51.399
<i>Do a pit maneuver or something!</i>

01:25:55.136 --> 01:25:57.269
<i>Oh, man. Oh, no.</i>

01:26:04.212 --> 01:26:06.513
- Don't shoot!
<i>- Get your hands up!</i>

01:26:06.514 --> 01:26:08.247
- <i>Get your hands above your head!</i>
- Don't shoot.

01:26:08.248 --> 01:26:09.882
- Get over here!
<i>- We got him!</i>

01:26:11.452 --> 01:26:13.185
You have the right to remain silent.

01:26:13.186 --> 01:26:15.221
- Anything you say...
- That's enough, buddy.

01:26:15.222 --> 01:26:17.290
...can be held against you. Okay.

01:26:17.291 --> 01:26:20.059
You are done, man. You
and Verdean are done!

01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:22.429
Tony Lazarus's church is crap!

01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:25.431
- Huh? How does it feel?
- It feels great, man.

01:26:25.432 --> 01:26:26.899
Yeah, I'm sure it does.

01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:28.902
You had a hand in taking it down.

01:26:28.903 --> 01:26:32.439
A huge hand, and I give
you a hand for that.

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:34.209
Get him out of here. Get him to jail.

01:26:38.578 --> 01:26:40.447
Yeah!

01:26:40.448 --> 01:26:42.116
Whoo!

01:26:52.025 --> 01:26:54.226
Carol. Carol!

I'm a...

01:27:04.939 --> 01:27:06.605
I'm a charlatan.

01:27:06.606 --> 01:27:09.909
- I don't understand.
- I stole the Goliath skull

01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:13.046
from a grave in Jerusalem...

01:27:13.047 --> 01:27:15.215
and I buried it in Gath.

01:27:15.216 --> 01:27:18.350
<i>I never meant to hurt anybody,
I just wanted to give people</i>

01:27:18.351 --> 01:27:20.620
a reason to believe.

01:27:20.621 --> 01:27:22.922
How long have you been doin' this?

01:27:22.923 --> 01:27:24.590
It was just the skull.

01:27:24.591 --> 01:27:27.260
Carol, I swear.

01:27:27.261 --> 01:27:29.662
If I have to spend the rest of my life

01:27:29.663 --> 01:27:32.900
tryin' to earn your forgiveness, I will.

01:27:34.668 --> 01:27:37.470
- I love you, Carol.
<i>- Hey, get down on your knees.</i>

01:27:37.471 --> 01:27:40.408

We are standing just outside

the recently foreclosed on
Friendship Harvest Temple

01:28:19.579 --> 01:28:22.381
where Pastor Fontaine is
accused of... there he is now!

01:28:22.382 --> 01:28:24.016
- Not today. Get that thing out of my face.
- Pastor Fontaine,

01:28:24.017 --> 01:28:26.152
what do you have to say about the misuse...

01:28:26.153 --> 01:28:28.354
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- ...of church funds

01:28:28.355 --> 01:28:31.524
- to hire local restaurateur Chang...
- Don Verdean is the fraud.

01:28:31.525 --> 01:28:33.626
- Not me and that's all I have to say.
- Your actions were in fact

01:28:33.627 --> 01:28:35.427
- fraudulent...
- This interview is done!

01:28:35.428 --> 01:28:37.899
- ...even un-Christian!
- Done!

01:28:39.499 --> 01:28:42.068
<i>Reverend Lazarus, what
has this been like for you</i>

01:28:42.069 --> 01:28:44.571
and for your flock since
Mr. Verdean was convicted

01:28:44.572 --> 01:28:46.506
of fraud, larceny,

01:28:46.507 --> 01:28:49.509
aggravated assault, and
accessory to kidnapping?

01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:51.176
Well, as you can imagine,

01:28:51.177 --> 01:28:53.712
it has been very, very difficult.

01:28:53.713 --> 01:28:55.314
It's been tough times.

01:28:55.315 --> 01:28:57.349
Tough for my marriage,

01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:59.485
tough for my members,

01:28:59.486 --> 01:29:01.121
tough for my very faith.

01:29:01.122 --> 01:29:04.024
But I do believe that Don Verdean

01:29:04.025 --> 01:29:05.492
has a good heart,

01:29:05.493 --> 01:29:07.726
and I believe his heart
was in the right place.

01:29:07.727 --> 01:29:09.595
So, Don,

01:29:09.596 --> 01:29:11.230
I forgive you.

01:29:11.231 --> 01:29:13.198
And if you are watchin' this,

01:29:13.199 --> 01:29:16.202
I think the Lord forgives you, too.

01:29:16.203 --> 01:29:17.636
Amen.

01:29:24.444 --> 01:29:25.912
Let's go.

01:29:40.093 --> 01:29:41.561
Whoo.

01:29:43.230 --> 01:29:45.033
So, have you joined a gang yet?

01:29:46.499 --> 01:29:50.103
Gotta join a gang, Don, I'm telling you.

01:29:50.104 --> 01:29:52.171
I'm in the Jewish Brotherhood

01:29:52.172 --> 01:29:54.174
with Todd Katzenberg.

01:29:54.175 --> 01:29:56.275
Todd's a tough guy, man.

01:29:56.276 --> 01:29:58.144
A good accountant, too.

01:29:58.145 --> 01:30:01.547
We're called the "He-bros."

01:30:01.548 --> 01:30:03.683
I can get you in...

01:30:03.684 --> 01:30:07.153
but we might have to jump you first.

01:30:07.154 --> 01:30:10.090
No, thank you, Boaz, I'm doin' all right.

01:30:10.091 --> 01:30:12.224
Okay.

01:30:12.225 --> 01:30:14.561
I made you something.

01:30:20.133 --> 01:30:21.867
Check it out.

01:30:21.868 --> 01:30:25.138
It's a toothbrush/shiv.

01:30:25.139 --> 01:30:27.172
This part can brush your teeth,

01:30:27.173 --> 01:30:28.675
this part is a knife.

01:30:28.676 --> 01:30:31.679
Brush, stab. Brush, stab.

01:30:33.114 --> 01:30:36.149
Take it, Don, I made this one for you.

01:30:36.150 --> 01:30:38.617
It's okay, I've got another
one in my butt crack.

01:30:38.618 --> 01:30:40.555
No, thank you.

01:30:45.626 --> 01:30:47.760
Anytime,

01:30:47.761 --> 01:30:49.362
anywhere,

01:30:49.363 --> 01:30:51.197
any place.

01:30:51.198 --> 01:30:53.668
I'll be here to protect you.

01:30:57.303 --> 01:30:58.837
<i>Shalom.</i>

01:30:58.838 --> 01:31:00.674
<i>Shalom.</i>

01:31:45.351 --> 01:31:47.087
Mind if I sit down?

01:31:51.458 --> 01:31:53.027
My name's Don.
