00:09.511 --> 00:12.555
<i>NARRATOR".
A beastly hot day in Gotham City.</i>

00:12.764 --> 00:17.685
<i>Rare indeed for a metropolis
which generally enjoys perfect weather.</i>

00:17.894 --> 00:20.563
<i>But what better time of year...</i>

00:20.772 --> 00:24.234
<i>...for Gotham City's
Annual Miss Galaxy contest...</i>

00:24.442 --> 00:28.530
<i>...for which the five remaining contestants
are already preparing this morning...</i>

00:28.738 --> 00:30.782
<i>...for tonight's final event.</i>

00:30.990 --> 00:34.369
<i>And five beauties they are, indeed.</i>

00:34.577 --> 00:37.997
<i>Miss Corsica, Miss Canary Islands...</i>

00:38.206 --> 00:39.916
...Miss Barrier Reef...

00:40.124 --> 00:43.670
<i>...the local favorite,
Miss Gotham City herself...</i>

00:43.878 --> 00:46.756
<i>...and Miss Iceland.</i>

00:47.048 --> 00:48.258
<i>But what's this?</i>

00:48.466 --> 00:52.303
<i>Strangers are never allowed
in the beauty queen's dressing room...</i>

00:52.512 --> 00:55.390
<i>...let alone kidnappers.</i>

00:55.598 --> 00:58.685
<i>Let alone him.</i>

00:58.935 --> 01:01.604
Sorry I can't take you all with me.

01:01.813 --> 01:03.815
Ladies.

01:10.572 --> 01:12.532
Oh-ho! What a scorcher.

01:12.740 --> 01:15.702
Ninety-six in the shade
and the temperature's still rising.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.662
Miss Iceland?

01:17.870 --> 01:21.332
Kidnapped from the beauty pageant
dressing room?

01:21.791 --> 01:23.876
The leader was wearing what?

01:24.085 --> 01:26.504
A collar with jet nozzles?

01:26.713 --> 01:29.632
To keep his head cold?

01:30.049 --> 01:32.885
Of course. At once.

01:33.303 --> 01:35.305
Jet nozzles to keep your head cold?

01:35.513 --> 01:36.973
Sounds like a good invention.

01:37.181 --> 01:40.268
But there's just one man
who might have invented it, Chief O'Hara.

01:40.476 --> 01:45.565
Just one man who can live in an environment
50 degrees below zero.

01:45.773 --> 01:49.527
And just one man
who is likely to have kidnapped Miss Iceland.

01:49.736 --> 01:51.487
Shiver me timbers, commissioner.

01:51.696 --> 01:53.990
- You don't mean Mr. Freeze?
-I do, indeed.

01:54.198 --> 01:57.368
That cold-blooded, cold-hearted,
calloused culprit.

01:57.577 --> 02:01.497
Seems a pity on a day like this
to call out the Caped Crusader.

02:01.706 --> 02:03.916
Fair weather or foul,
dog days or a monsoon...

02:04.125 --> 02:07.337
...who else could we call in such a crisis?

02:07.670 --> 02:09.047
- And who else would answer?
-Mm.

02:09.255 --> 02:11.716
Maybe he'll welcome the air conditioning--

02:11.924 --> 02:13.593
Commissioner.

02:13.801 --> 02:18.056
I wonder if Batman will welcome
the air conditioning.

02:18.264 --> 02:19.682
Wild.

02:34.947 --> 02:36.407
Help!

02:41.037 --> 02:43.498
Frozen tight.

02:43.706 --> 02:45.583
What do we do?

02:51.172 --> 02:52.840
<i>NARRATOR".
And in Wayne Manor...</i>

02:54.842 --> 02:58.471
<i>...stately home of millionaire Bruce Wayne
and his youthful ward, Dick Grayson...</i>

02:58.680 --> 03:02.183
- Uh, <i>help.</i>
- Naturally, sir.

03:04.644 --> 03:06.604
Oh, Alfred.
Mrs. Cooper was looking for you.

03:06.813 --> 03:09.399
Something about that reception
she's planning tonight.

03:09.607 --> 03:11.484
Thank you, Alfred.

03:12.151 --> 03:14.487
- Yes, commissioner.
-Bat...

03:16.572 --> 03:17.907
<i>Help-</i>

03:21.786 --> 03:23.329
The commissioner.

03:23.538 --> 03:26.457
I think he was trying to tell me something.

03:26.749 --> 03:29.252
To the Batpoles. On the double.

05:07.183 --> 05:11.229
<i>NARRATOR". Meanwhile, in an ice cream truck
directly across the street...</i>

05:11.437 --> 05:17.819
<i>...the sinister Mr. Freeze
is plotting his next cold, calculating move.</i>

05:18.027 --> 05:23.574
So the Caped Crusaders
have come to the rescue after all.

05:23.991 --> 05:27.912
That means the newspaper reporters
won't be far behind.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.790
Wild. Chill?

05:31.749 --> 05:34.544
- You have the iceman?
-He's waiting outside, Mr. Freeze.

05:34.961 --> 05:36.379
Shivers, you have the ice?

05:36.587 --> 05:37.672
It's all ready, boss.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.924
- Get the operation going.
-Okay, boss.

05:43.427 --> 05:44.595
Holy polar front.

05:44.804 --> 05:48.432
Yes, Boy Wonder. The commissioner
and Chief O'Hara are trapped in that office.

05:48.641 --> 05:52.228
With frost and snow and slush and ice
pouring out all over.

05:52.436 --> 05:53.688
It's terrible.

05:53.896 --> 05:56.482
I'm afraid they died an icy death by now.

05:56.691 --> 05:59.777
A negative viewpoint, sergeant.
A man has nothing without hope.

05:59.986 --> 06:02.363
Robin, the plastic explosive.

06:03.823 --> 06:05.283
Stand clear, please.

06:33.895 --> 06:35.521
Darling, Miss Iceland.

06:35.730 --> 06:39.525
Soon I'll be able to make you
much more comfortable.

06:39.734 --> 06:45.823
Then I'll start lowering the temperature
in your lovely body...

06:46.032 --> 06:49.243
...and you will learn how to love me.

06:50.536 --> 06:57.543
To love me as much as most people
will learn how to hate Batman.

06:58.586 --> 07:01.923
No matter how thick the battle...

07:02.131 --> 07:05.426
...no matter how heavy the frost...

07:05.635 --> 07:11.432
...no matter who you really are
or where you ever come from...

07:11.641 --> 07:17.897
...I knew I could depend on you, Batman.

07:21.984 --> 07:24.779
But why can't we find out what happened?

07:24.987 --> 07:28.532
Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara
nearly freeze to death in this office...

07:28.741 --> 07:34.205
...on the hottest day of the year, and nobody
can or will give us any details whatsoever.

07:34.413 --> 07:36.916
- Yeah.
- Please. Please, gentlemen of the press...

07:37.333 --> 07:39.585
...and this attractive young lady.

07:39.794 --> 07:42.755
Nellie Majors. Gotham <i>City</i> Herald.

07:42.964 --> 07:44.090
As if you didn't know.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.842
I ask you all to be patient.

07:47.051 --> 07:50.221
Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara
will give you the details later.

07:50.429 --> 07:54.350
As you can see,
it's been a rather harrowing experience.

07:54.558 --> 07:56.727
That's what our readers buy, Batman.

07:56.936 --> 07:59.313
Harrowing experiences.

07:59.522 --> 08:02.984
Has this anything to do
with the kidnapping of Miss Iceland today?

08:03.401 --> 08:05.820
Miss Iceland kidnapped?

08:06.028 --> 08:07.321
Holy hijack.

08:07.780 --> 08:10.825
And might it involve
a certain arch criminal...

08:11.033 --> 08:15.162
...who escaped from the state penitentiary
last week in an ice cream truck?

08:15.371 --> 08:17.123
It just might, Nellie.

08:17.331 --> 08:22.128
Yes, it's very possible Mr. Freeze
has started another cold wave of terror.

08:22.336 --> 08:29.218
Robin, since when do we make
public accusations without strong solid proof?

08:29.593 --> 08:31.637
Robin's indiscreet statement...

08:32.138 --> 08:33.931
...is strictly off the record.

08:34.140 --> 08:35.808
Not off my record, Batman.

08:36.017 --> 08:37.643
I'm sorry, Ms. Majors...

08:38.102 --> 08:39.979
...I certainly wasn't suggesting...

08:40.187 --> 08:44.316
...what your paper should or should not print.
It's just that I feel--

08:44.525 --> 08:47.236
That you're on a spot, Batman? Is that it?

08:47.695 --> 08:51.323
Oh, I know you're a well-known crime-fighter
and a local hero.

08:52.408 --> 08:56.328
But I've seen many heroes tarnished
in the course of my career.

08:56.537 --> 09:00.082
Nellie, I won't have the Caped Crusader
spoken to like that in this office.

09:00.291 --> 09:02.960
You too, commissioner?
Something to hide?

09:06.672 --> 09:08.549
Where did you come from?
Who ordered that?

09:08.758 --> 09:12.136
A couple of guys down on the street sent it up.
Paid off in advance.

09:12.344 --> 09:15.556
Nice present on a day like this.

09:18.350 --> 09:19.393
"To Batman.

09:19.602 --> 09:22.354
For incidental crime expenses."

09:22.563 --> 09:23.898
I-C-E.

09:24.106 --> 09:25.775
Ice?

09:26.150 --> 09:29.028
Ice. Green ice.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.821
Bribe money, Batman?

09:31.030 --> 09:35.076
A reward for not revealing
what happened here today?

09:35.576 --> 09:37.578
Afraid I don't understand, Ms. Majors.

09:37.787 --> 09:43.042
I doubt if the readers of the Gotham <i>City</i> Herald
will be equally deluded.

09:45.044 --> 09:48.672
Your mask seems to make
an excellent blindfold.

09:48.881 --> 09:50.216
Come on, fellas.

09:58.057 --> 10:04.188
Regardless of how this little windfall
is interpreted, I'd still like to see it go...

10:04.396 --> 10:06.732
...to the Policemen's Welfare Fund,
commissioner.

10:06.941 --> 10:08.859
After the way you've been vilified today?

10:09.068 --> 10:12.905
It's not your fault, commissioner,
and I certainly don't blame Ms. Majors.

10:13.114 --> 10:15.366
A reporter's lot is not easy.

10:15.825 --> 10:17.827
Making exciting stories...

10:18.035 --> 10:22.498
...out of plain, average,
everyday people like Robin and me.

10:27.419 --> 10:30.923
<i>NARRATOR". In a seemingly abandoned
cold storage plant...</i>

10:31.132 --> 10:34.051
<i>...Mr. Freeze has taken up
temporary residence...</i>

10:34.260 --> 10:38.597
...where <i>even now he is coldly calculating
his next move...</i>

10:38.806 --> 10:42.977
<i>...in Operation Hate Batman.</i>

10:43.185 --> 10:45.604
Wild, boys. Wild.

10:45.813 --> 10:49.650
Look here. "ls Batman being bribed?

10:49.859 --> 10:52.111
Is Batman on ice?

10:52.319 --> 10:56.365
What slippery character is putting the skids
under the Caped Crusader?"

10:56.574 --> 11:00.244
Written by someone called Nellie Majors.

11:00.452 --> 11:03.956
Very good article too. Must be a
very clever woman, that Nellie Majors.

11:04.165 --> 11:06.542
- Don't you think so, boys?
-Sure do, boss.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.837
She's the smartest news hand
on the Gotham City Herald, Mr. Freeze.

11:10.045 --> 11:14.508
Wild. Now, put on your costumes
for the next maneuver.

11:14.717 --> 11:20.055
Well, the Cape Crusader
is getting the works at last.

11:20.264 --> 11:23.851
Now he'll understand
what it is like not to be loved.

11:24.059 --> 11:26.645
Now he'll feel hate for once.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.648
Hate. Like I feel hate.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.609
You should feel hate.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.152
I certainly hate you.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.779
But why, my darling Miss Iceland?

11:35.988 --> 11:37.406
Haven't I made you comfortable?

11:37.615 --> 11:41.952
All this beautiful furniture,
those nice cool frosty bars...

11:42.161 --> 11:45.247
...to lower the temperature
in your beautiful body?

11:45.456 --> 11:48.876
To air condition you, darling,
so you would stop hating me?

11:49.585 --> 11:54.006
Once you hit 50-degree below zero,
you will be loving me.

11:54.215 --> 11:56.342
Loving you?

11:56.550 --> 12:00.262
Oh, you're a monster. Never.

12:00.471 --> 12:01.889
Oh, we'll see.

12:02.097 --> 12:04.058
- We'll see.
-Oh!

12:05.768 --> 12:10.522
You will see, Mr. Freeze. Wasn't there something
in those newspapers about my kidnapping?

12:10.856 --> 12:12.483
A small item or two.

12:12.691 --> 12:18.697
But all the important headlines
were taken up by Batman's disgrace.

12:26.080 --> 12:30.584
Do my eyes deceive me
or is this the Dynamic Duo?

12:30.793 --> 12:33.087
We put on the costume
like you said, Mr. Freeze.

12:33.295 --> 12:34.964
- I'm Batman.
-I'm Robin.

12:35.172 --> 12:38.884
Wild. From a distance,
even I couldn't tell the difference.

12:39.093 --> 12:41.762
Now, this is my plan.

12:41.971 --> 12:44.848
We've fed the Batanalyzer
all the pertinent information...

12:45.057 --> 12:47.935
...on Mr. Freeze's past crimes.

12:48.269 --> 12:52.273
Now, let's see what it computes
for the future.

12:57.236 --> 12:59.238
What is it, Batman?

13:02.449 --> 13:06.495
It's more green ice.

13:06.704 --> 13:09.373
- Yes, Alfred?
-Knowing first things come first, sir...

13:09.581 --> 13:13.544
...I waited until the last possible moment
before interrupting your computations...

13:13.752 --> 13:16.880
...but, uh, the guests will be arriving shortly.

13:17.089 --> 13:18.382
- Guests?
-Yes, sir.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.760
The poolside reception this evening.
For the Bruce Wayne Foundation.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.220
Holy tuxedo.

13:23.429 --> 13:25.681
If we're late, Aunt Harriett will kill us.

13:25.889 --> 13:30.185
"Kill" is not a word to be bandied about
haphazardly, Robin.

13:30.394 --> 13:33.230
Angry, yes,
as well she might be if we're late.

13:33.439 --> 13:36.984
Don't forget, we placed the entire burden
of this reception...

13:37.192 --> 13:40.154
...on her stout, unselfish shoulders.

13:40.362 --> 13:41.989
On the double.

13:44.116 --> 13:45.826
Good evening, Mayor Linseed.

13:46.035 --> 13:48.203
And Linda. How nice to have you.

13:48.412 --> 13:50.289
It's so nice to be here, Mrs. Cooper.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.500
Any party at stately Wayne Manor
is a big event in our lives.

13:53.709 --> 13:56.086
- Thank you.
-My dear.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.631
What could have happened
to Bruce and Dick?

13:59.840 --> 14:01.592
He'll be here in a moment, madam.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.720
Oh, here they are now.

14:05.637 --> 14:08.307
- Sorry, Aunt Harriett, a slight delay.
-I lost a cuff link.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.352
Well, I think everyone's here.

14:11.810 --> 14:15.439
Alfred, ask the caterer to start passing
the hors d'oeuvres.

14:15.647 --> 14:16.940
They already are, madam.

14:17.149 --> 14:20.069
But I'll check again below stairs.

14:22.988 --> 14:26.283
Beautiful, Aunt Harriett.
You've outdone yourself, as usual.

14:26.492 --> 14:28.285
You really like it?

14:28.494 --> 14:31.789
I originally planned
to have it all Japanese-y...

14:31.997 --> 14:35.417
...but the caterer called and suggested Irish.

14:35.626 --> 14:39.004
He said green was most becoming
to women guests.

14:39.213 --> 14:40.464
What do you think?

14:40.672 --> 14:44.968
- Green?
-I even had the reflection pool dyed green.

14:45.177 --> 14:48.639
- Mrs. Cooper is a clever colleen, Bruce.
-Yes. Who would have thought it?

14:48.847 --> 14:53.185
A wee bit of the Emerald Isle
right outside of Gotham City. Heh-heh.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.107
Holy shamrocks.

14:58.315 --> 14:59.400
Emerald.

14:59.608 --> 15:02.194
Also known among the criminal set...

15:02.403 --> 15:04.113
...as green ice.
-Green ice.

15:04.321 --> 15:05.531
Stop.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.283
Don't move, anybody.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.830
Nobody move.

15:14.248 --> 15:15.749
What in the world is this?

15:15.958 --> 15:17.000
Let's get him quick.

15:17.209 --> 15:19.169
Patience, Dick Grayson.

15:19.628 --> 15:20.963
You've all heard me.

15:21.505 --> 15:24.842
So no monkey business.

15:25.384 --> 15:26.552
Who is he?

15:26.760 --> 15:31.432
How dare he come here
and spoil our nice party.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.600
Maybe that special duty policeman--

15:42.484 --> 15:44.278
Bruce, we just can't stand here.

15:44.486 --> 15:48.365
These are my guests, Dick. I don't dare
make a move to put them in further jeopardy.

15:48.574 --> 15:49.616
Waiters.

15:49.825 --> 15:53.245
Clear your trays
and fill them up with real goodies.

15:53.454 --> 15:55.080
Wild. Ha-ha-ha!

15:57.666 --> 15:58.876
That voice.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.462
It sounds exactly like the caterer...

16:01.670 --> 16:05.466
...who called suggesting the Irish motif.
-Figures.

16:05.674 --> 16:07.342
I'll try sneaking around him.

16:07.551 --> 16:09.553
No, Chief O'Hara.

16:09.761 --> 16:14.600
Better the loss of a few baubles
than the life of a stalwart citizen.

16:14.808 --> 16:15.851
No, no. Not that.

16:16.059 --> 16:19.271
No. It's engraved. A generous memento, given
to me by the good people of Gotham City.

16:20.898 --> 16:23.734
- You can't do that.
- Don't fight it, Aunt Harriet.

16:24.860 --> 16:28.322
One day, these men will get
their just desserts.

16:28.530 --> 16:31.158
- Oh!
-You said it, Aunt Harriett.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.869
Enough amusement for now.

16:34.077 --> 16:37.789
And so you don't do anything foolish
like following us...

16:37.998 --> 16:40.584
...everybody into the pool, please.

16:43.128 --> 16:44.379
Bruce.

16:44.588 --> 16:46.507
This is too much. Do something.

16:47.299 --> 16:48.592
Under the circumstances...

16:48.800 --> 16:52.346
...I think it would be wise
to follow his instructions.

16:52.554 --> 16:56.350
When I say in the pool, I mean in the pool.

16:56.558 --> 16:58.143
Move, please.

16:58.602 --> 17:00.812
I have never felt so indignant.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.105
Or so helpless.

17:24.294 --> 17:26.255
That'll cool you off a little.

17:26.463 --> 17:28.006
Wild. Ha-ha-ha!

17:31.927 --> 17:35.180
- Green ice.
-Just as the computer predicted.

17:35.556 --> 17:38.225
If only Batman and Robin were here.

17:38.433 --> 17:42.020
Sure, and our only chance for salvation
are the Caped Crusaders.

17:44.982 --> 17:47.818
They must have heard us.

17:48.026 --> 17:51.154
All right, Mr. Freeze.
Give back those jewels or else.

17:51.363 --> 17:52.447
Or what else?

17:52.656 --> 17:54.241
You'll be sorry.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.535
That's wild. Ha-ha-ha!

18:32.321 --> 18:34.448
Easy, Batman. You almost hit me.

18:34.656 --> 18:37.326
Oh, sorry, Mr. Freeze.
I'll be more careful next time.

18:59.264 --> 19:01.767
Batman and Robin, don't leave us.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.686
No, the safety of the guests here comes first.

19:04.895 --> 19:07.147
- How do I look with egg on my face?
- Shh, shh.

19:09.107 --> 19:11.193
Wild. Ha-ha-ha!

19:13.904 --> 19:17.032
Strange,
the Dynamic Duo acting in this manner.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.785
It's not like them. Not like them at all.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.578
It is not.

19:21.787 --> 19:24.414
Though everyone has heard
the recent rumor.

19:24.623 --> 19:27.542
<i>That's, 'fi they read the Gotham City Herald.</i>

19:32.172 --> 19:34.758
Merciful heavens.

19:39.513 --> 19:41.723
Your arrival was well-timed, Alfred.

19:41.932 --> 19:45.519
If you hadn't turned on that pool heater,
we'd all still be frozen in.

19:45.727 --> 19:48.772
A clever ploy by Mr. Freeze, I'm afraid.

19:48.980 --> 19:52.067
- That inhuman ice cube.
-If I'd arrived even earlier, sir...

19:52.275 --> 19:55.821
...I might have been able to expose
those impostors of his.

19:56.697 --> 19:59.074
Um, if I may say so, sir.

19:59.282 --> 20:04.204
I'm a bit concerned about the current
reputation of the Caped Crusaders.

20:04.413 --> 20:07.124
- Me too.
-There are other reputations to be considered.

20:07.332 --> 20:10.043
Commissioner Gordon, Chief O'Hara,
Mayor Linseed.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.337
None of this looks good for Gotham City.

20:12.546 --> 20:13.922
But Alfred's right, Batman.

20:14.131 --> 20:16.800
Everyone will believe that story
about you taking a bribe.

20:17.008 --> 20:19.928
Unless we capture Mr. Freeze
and return the jewels tonight.

20:20.137 --> 20:22.431
And perhaps rescue Miss Iceland.

20:22.639 --> 20:26.226
Her kidnapping seems to have
become secondary.

20:26.435 --> 20:29.104
A regrettable situation for any young girl.

20:29.312 --> 20:32.733
I hear Iceland is considering severing
diplomatic relations, sir.

20:32.941 --> 20:34.860
Which we must prevent at all cost.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.737
But where could he be hiding out?

20:39.448 --> 20:41.908
Yes. Three good possibilities.

20:42.117 --> 20:45.996
"The Bottling Works,
the Meat Packing Company...

20:46.204 --> 20:49.958
...and the Frosty Freezies Factory."

20:50.500 --> 20:55.172
Currently shut down
but adjoining the cold storage plant.

20:57.716 --> 21:00.552
Beautiful. Beautiful.

21:00.761 --> 21:04.598
Beautiful for my beautiful love.

21:04.806 --> 21:07.392
I want nothing from you. Ever.

21:07.601 --> 21:10.103
Perhaps you're not cool enough
to be cooperative.

21:10.645 --> 21:12.564
I'm colder than I want to be.

21:12.773 --> 21:15.150
- My fingers are getting numb.
-That's good.

21:15.692 --> 21:17.986
Your metabolism is changing...

21:18.195 --> 21:22.157
...and your temperature
is still a bit above zero.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.701
In the morning, you'll be 50 below.

21:24.910 --> 21:27.245
And madly in love with me.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.331
You could turn me into a glacier...

21:30.290 --> 21:32.083
...and I still wouldn't love you.

21:32.292 --> 21:36.379
You a glacier, darling Miss Iceland?
Never.

21:36.588 --> 21:41.176
But I have other plans
for a monstrous ice floe.

21:47.599 --> 21:49.142
What is it, Chill?

21:49.351 --> 21:52.687
Here's the frozen reindeer meat
you wanted for a midnight snack.

21:52.896 --> 21:56.107
Oh. What else?
Something seems to be bothering you.

21:56.316 --> 22:00.529
I was leaving the Meat Packing Company,
the Batmobile pulled up.

22:00.737 --> 22:04.533
Oh, so the Cape Crusaders
are now checking cold storage units.

22:04.741 --> 22:06.243
And getting closer.

22:06.451 --> 22:10.622
Now the Batmobile is parked
in front of the Frosty Freezies Factory.

22:10.831 --> 22:13.542
Batman and Robin must be inside.

22:13.750 --> 22:15.252
Wild.

22:15.460 --> 22:21.967
We will put the Dynamic Duo on ice
once and forever.

22:22.175 --> 22:24.010
Gosh, Batman. Dig those flavors.

22:24.219 --> 22:27.681
"Lemon lime, orange, raspberry, pineapple."

22:27.889 --> 22:29.683
Take your choice, Boy Wonder.

22:30.225 --> 22:33.144
Haven't you read the newspapers?
Haven't you heard the stories?

22:33.770 --> 22:35.438
The public is fickle.

22:35.647 --> 22:38.316
You're no longer the great hero
of Gotham City.

22:38.525 --> 22:42.904
And soon, very soon, you'll be hated.
Despised like me.

22:43.113 --> 22:45.115
Wild. Ha-ha-ha!

23:26.573 --> 23:28.408
Ha-ha-ha! Wild.

23:28.617 --> 23:30.410
Look out, Robin. The freeze gun.

23:42.505 --> 23:45.091
So you wanted to outsmart me, eh?

23:45.300 --> 23:49.095
But you can't outsmart the machinery
in this factory.

23:49.304 --> 23:53.850
And soon you'll be the first
two human frosty freezies in history.

23:54.059 --> 23:56.102
Ha-ha-ha! Wild.
