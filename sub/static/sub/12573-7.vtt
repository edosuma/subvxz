00:39.450 --> 00:41.060
This is terrible.

00:49.670 --> 00:52.070
What do you see, shota?

00:53.950 --> 00:55.480
The future.

00:56.150 --> 01:00.310
In three days' time, the seeker will die.

01:07.340 --> 01:09.860
Legend of the Seeker S01E07 Identity

01:09.960 --> 01:12.630
The saddles will be arriving in the next shipment.

01:12.850 --> 01:16.500
But I've made special arrangements to have the boots delivered tomorrow.

01:16.850 --> 01:19.159
Anything to help the d'haran in course.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.889
Excellent service, as always.

01:21.890 --> 01:23.199
Well, you know how much I appreciate

01:23.200 --> 01:25.630
All the business you send my way, commander.

01:27.530 --> 01:29.140
Ready the horses.

01:38.300 --> 01:40.930
Just a little something to say thanks.

01:45.710 --> 01:47.310
You're too kind.

01:50.480 --> 01:52.940
We'll drink it in celebration of your son's wedding.

02:21.110 --> 02:22.219
Kahlan.

02:22.220 --> 02:24.589
Thank the spirits. I thought you were dead.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.270
I almost was.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.150
A few times.

02:32.300 --> 02:34.440
Looks like business being good.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.449
A little too good, I'm afraid.

02:37.450 --> 02:39.510
I have more customers now than ever.

02:40.940 --> 02:43.259
Unfortunately, they're all d'harans.

02:43.260 --> 02:45.859
Imagine their surprise if they found out all the money they

02:45.860 --> 02:48.789
Were giving you was being funneled right back into the resistance

02:48.790 --> 02:52.410
Well, some of it finds its way back into commander morcant's pockets.

02:52.460 --> 02:54.259
You pay him for information? No, no.

02:54.260 --> 02:56.299
The bribes simply ensure repeat business.

02:56.300 --> 02:57.849
His big mouth does the rest.

02:57.850 --> 02:59.959
Hopefully your investment will pay off.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.009
We need some of that information.

03:02.010 --> 03:04.189
We've learned from an informant that darken

03:04.190 --> 03:06.960
Rahl is massing troops at a place not far from here

03:07.040 --> 03:08.890
It's called kelabra.

03:09.850 --> 03:12.500
We still speak that name in a whisper

03:12.780 --> 03:14.759
If they speak it at all.

03:14.760 --> 03:17.429
It was once the most opulent city in the midlands.

03:17.430 --> 03:20.040
Until an invading army lay siege to it.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.659
Rather than surrender, the kelabran people killed themselves.

03:23.660 --> 03:28.460
Their last dying act was to curse anyone that entered the city walls.

03:28.790 --> 03:31.959
One year to the day, mount mariah erupted, burying the invaders beneath

03:31.960 --> 03:34.100
In a rain of molten rock,

03:34.290 --> 03:38.160
And destroyed all trace of that once glorious cit

03:39.110 --> 03:40.849
What would the d'harans want with it?

03:40.850 --> 03:43.610
I don't know. It's a forsaken wasteland.

03:44.180 --> 03:46.750
Tomorrow I'll pay commander morcant a visit.

03:46.950 --> 03:52.509
If I know the commander, he won't be able to keep his mouth shut about it,

03:52.510 --> 03:54.990
Gryff  This is kahlan and her friends zedd and richard

03:55.870 --> 03:58.490
The first true seeker in a thousand years.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.910
It's an honor.

04:02.170 --> 04:04.290
The sword of truth.

04:04.420 --> 04:07.310
So it is true about the nick on the hilt.

04:08.560 --> 04:12.629
The last true seeker, kieran, got it in the battle of barrier peaks.

04:12.630 --> 04:14.529
I always wondered where it came from.

04:14.530 --> 04:15.809
Since gryff's been able to read,

04:15.810 --> 04:17.910
He's been quite the student of seeker lore.

04:19.089 --> 04:21.099
So, what brings you to town?

04:21.100 --> 04:23.029
I can't imagine you're here for the wedding.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.359
Ah, yes, indeed.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.130
My son's getting married.

04:26.220 --> 04:27.879
Congratulations, gryff.

04:27.880 --> 04:32.120
Of all the magic in the world, none is more powerful than love.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.449
Ha-ha. Don't tell me you learned to

04:43.450 --> 04:45.780
Fight like this from your seeker books

04:46.490 --> 04:49.940
My father had me trained by the best swordsmen in the area.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.609
Maybe I could come with you.

04:51.610 --> 04:53.279
Help you fight the d'harans.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.559
What would your bride think about that?

04:55.560 --> 04:56.919
Bronwyn?

04:56.920 --> 04:58.560
Couldn't really tell you.

04:58.860 --> 05:00.270
I barely know her.

05:03.640 --> 05:05.130
How's that?

05:05.230 --> 05:07.180
It's arranged marriage.

05:13.360 --> 05:17.729
Bronwyn's family has their name, but not much else.

05:17.730 --> 05:22.220
The union will restore her family's wealth and my father

05:22.500 --> 05:26.710
Will have her family's influence to strengthen the resistance

05:38.210 --> 05:41.990
But I'd rather be fighting darken rahl than marrying a girl I hardly know.

05:43.430 --> 05:46.270
You know, part of me envies you.

05:47.380 --> 05:50.720
You get to settle down, get married, raise a family.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.150
That's something I may never get to do.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.800
But you have kahlan, don't you?

05:56.080 --> 05:58.659
Yeah, but we're not...

05:58.660 --> 06:00.730
Oh, I thought maybe you were.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.450
Don't you need to be getting ready for your wedding?

06:07.660 --> 06:09.279
Bronwyn's a lucky girl.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.130
And you'll make a fine husband.

06:24.730 --> 06:28.480
You must not go to kelabra.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.239
How did you know--?

06:30.240 --> 06:35.380
In two days' time, the seeker will die at kelabra.

06:35.760 --> 06:38.490
This I have seen in a vision.

06:39.050 --> 06:39.929
A vision?

06:39.930 --> 06:42.250
Of one possible future.

06:42.840 --> 06:47.149
One you can change if you stay away from that dreaded place.

06:47.150 --> 06:48.420
Who are you?

06:49.100 --> 06:51.170
That matters not.

06:51.460 --> 06:57.900
You will know what I say is true when you set eyes upon the eagle.

07:03.250 --> 07:04.670
Richard.

07:23.330 --> 07:26.340
Whatever they have planned at kelabra, it's big.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.239
They've been shipping in barrels of

07:28.240 --> 07:30.889
Dragon's breath, a highly explosive ore

07:30.890 --> 07:32.789
They must be arming for an attack.

07:32.790 --> 07:34.989
But on what? They already control the region.

07:34.990 --> 07:37.270
I couldn't find out exactly what they've been planning,

07:37.370 --> 07:40.750
But Darken rahl's appointed someone to oversee the operation

07:41.010 --> 07:43.080
A man called nass.

07:46.470 --> 07:47.990
Demmin nass?

07:47.990 --> 07:49.039
You know him?

07:49.040 --> 07:51.029
Only by reputation.

07:51.030 --> 07:53.939
Nass is darken rahl's most trusted commander.

07:53.940 --> 07:55.169
He's a butcher.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.679
A ruthless enforcer.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.620
If he's dispatching his right-hand man to Kelabra,

07:59.820 --> 08:02.080
I hate to think what rahl is plotting.

08:07.150 --> 08:09.890
Maybe this is the chance we've been waiting for.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.949
I mean, we can never find darken rahl

08:11.950 --> 08:16.220
Because he's always changing his location.

08:17.430 --> 08:20.630
But if this demmin nass is his most trusted commander,

08:22.380 --> 08:24.100
Wouldn't he know where he is?

08:26.550 --> 08:29.500
If we can infiltrate the encampment at Kelabra

08:29.820 --> 08:32.479
And get close to demmin nass..

08:32.480 --> 08:34.250
I could confess him.

08:35.520 --> 08:39.568
And we'd have one of rahl's inner circle as our ally.

08:39.570 --> 08:42.179
And if we can find rahl, we can kill him.

08:43.100 --> 08:45.569
My men are to deliver provisions to the d'harans.

08:45.570 --> 08:48.100
But if you take my supply wagon and make the delivery,

08:48.180 --> 08:50.089
You can get inside the encampment.

08:50.090 --> 08:52.119
This is a map of the encampment up at kelabra.

08:52.120 --> 08:54.380
I managed to steal it while morcant wasn't looking.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.369
When you set eyes upon the eagle...

09:05.370 --> 09:06.980
The eagle.

09:07.920 --> 09:11.580
This woman told you the seeker will die at kelabra?

09:12.890 --> 09:14.470
This mission is already risky enough

09:14.470 --> 09:16.800
Without a vision of the seeker's death.

09:17.010 --> 09:19.420
We need to find out how she knows we're going to Kelabra,

09:19.420 --> 09:21.569
Otherwise we could be walking into a trap.

09:21.570 --> 09:23.679
Well, you better hurry. According to morcant,

09:23.680 --> 09:26.019
Nass will be at the encampment for only one day.

09:26.020 --> 09:29.449
If we try to find this woman, we could miss our only chance at nass.

09:29.450 --> 09:32.670
We don't even know if there's any truth warning.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.860
We can't lose this opportunity.

09:44.090 --> 09:45.480
Fool!

09:49.010 --> 09:51.280
What troubles you, shota?

09:52.260 --> 09:54.630
My warning has gone unheeded.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.340
Who are you?

10:12.080 --> 10:15.449
Someone who can give you what you truly want.

10:15.450 --> 10:16.989
What are you talking about?

10:16.990 --> 10:19.369
You want a life of adventure.

10:19.370 --> 10:21.860
You don't wanna be married.

10:22.430 --> 10:25.330
There's nothing anyone can do to change that.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.990
Change?

10:28.870 --> 10:32.230
There is much I can change.

10:32.580 --> 10:36.360
I can change you into the seeker.

10:37.110 --> 10:41.159
When others look on you, they'll see richard cypher.

10:41.160 --> 10:45.600
And when they look on cypher, they will see you.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.850
How can you do that?

10:52.180 --> 10:55.300
It's already done.

10:58.470 --> 10:59.840
What are you doing?

11:01.170 --> 11:03.450
Put down richard's sword, gryff.

11:06.460 --> 11:09.340
The sword of truth is not a toy.

11:09.410 --> 11:10.649
What's going on?

11:10.650 --> 11:13.370
How did gryff get his hands on your sword, richard?

11:14.140 --> 11:18.279
No harm done, but the sword of truth belongs in the hands of the seeker.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.909
This is insane. It's me, richard.

11:20.910 --> 11:22.859
Bronwyn is a very lucky girl.

11:22.860 --> 11:24.540
And you'll make a fine husband.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.530
I think we should get moving.

11:33.090 --> 11:34.749
Time to get married, son.

11:34.750 --> 11:37.260
What? I'm not your son. I'm not gryff.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.490
Kahlan!

11:49.510 --> 11:51.940
I need to borrow a horse to get zedd and kahlan now,

11:51.940 --> 11:55.180
Do you understand? I understand perfectly.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.670
I felt the same way on the day I married your mother.

11:58.670 --> 12:00.749
It's natural to feel nervous on your wedding day.

12:00.750 --> 12:03.319
No, there is nothing natural-- that's enough, gryff!

12:03.320 --> 12:06.399
You are getting married, so get your saddle on straight.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.120
Your new in-laws are here.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.029
A fine day for a wedding.

12:16.030 --> 12:16.959
Yes, indeed.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.990
And no one's more excited than gryff.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.310
Where is he?

12:38.750 --> 12:42.260
You would dishonor my sister by leaving her at the wedding altar?

12:42.440 --> 12:43.879
There's been a mistake.

12:43.880 --> 12:45.419
The mistake is yours.

12:45.420 --> 12:49.379
You have insulted bronwyn and you have insulted our family name.

12:49.380 --> 12:50.939
I'm not who you think-- the only thing

12:50.940 --> 12:53.760
I wanna hear out of you are wedding vows.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.900
This marriage will go ahead.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.660
My family has too much at stake for you ruin it.

13:06.690 --> 13:09.340
I know your father's little secret.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.889
So either you come back with us now and marry our sister,

13:15.890 --> 13:19.900
Or I'll tell the d'harans your father's been helping the resistance

13:22.260 --> 13:24.380
So, what's it going to be?

13:26.370 --> 13:31.289
Above you are the stars. Below you are the stones.

13:31.290 --> 13:34.380
As time shall pass, remember,

13:34.380 --> 13:37.300
Like a stone should your love be strong,

13:37.300 --> 13:40.920
Like a star should your love be constant.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.710
Bronwyn...

13:46.160 --> 13:53.120
...Do you bind your soul, your mind and your body with this man?

13:56.940 --> 14:01.549
Yes. And gryff, do you bind your soul,

14:01.550 --> 14:05.660
Your mind and your body with this woman

14:13.950 --> 14:15.210
Yes.

14:15.250 --> 14:21.040
Then as the spirits' witness, you are bonded in blood.

14:21.500 --> 14:26.400
For eternity, you are now one.

14:37.480 --> 14:40.420
Now the seeker is trapped.

14:57.440 --> 14:59.569
You've done it, shota.

14:59.570 --> 15:02.000
You've changed the future.

15:02.680 --> 15:04.320
Assemble your men.

15:04.950 --> 15:06.519
We must make sure that the seeker does not

15:06.520 --> 15:09.550
Try to rejoin his friends on their doomed mission.

15:17.090 --> 15:20.139
I'll drive the supply wagon up to the encampment.

15:20.140 --> 15:23.980
The d'harans will take the crates to the command tent.

15:24.130 --> 15:29.409
Only there won't be provisions inside the crates, there'll be you two.

15:29.410 --> 15:32.359
I'll need to get nass alone if I'm going to confess him.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.550
It won't be easy with all those soldiers.

15:37.350 --> 15:39.309
Any ideas, seeker?

15:39.310 --> 15:43.380
Uh, yes, we should...

15:45.160 --> 15:47.900
...Never do that which your enemy will do for you.

15:48.950 --> 15:50.410
What did you say?

15:51.200 --> 15:54.499
It's just something the seeker of the third era used to say.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.009
He was a shrewd tactician.

15:56.010 --> 15:59.390
I know, I'm just surprised you did.

15:59.780 --> 16:05.179
I read about it in the book gryff gave me.

16:05.180 --> 16:07.820
It has all the history of seekers past.

16:10.510 --> 16:13.470
I'm glad to see you're learning from those who came before you.

16:16.230 --> 16:19.460
What was the seeker of the third era suggest?

16:20.900 --> 16:22.830
A diversion?

16:23.730 --> 16:25.279
Good idea.

16:25.280 --> 16:28.719
We could ignite their stockpile of dragon's breath.

16:28.720 --> 16:33.740
That would distract the soldiers, and following d'haran military protocol,

16:33.740 --> 16:37.619
They would take demmin nass to the safety of the command tent..

16:37.620 --> 16:40.690
Where richard and I would be waiting to confess him.

16:42.300 --> 16:45.810
Let the d'harans do our work for us.

16:46.330 --> 16:49.150
Perhaps one day future seekers will be quoting you.

16:50.490 --> 16:55.189
To my son gryff, and his lovely bride, bronwyn.

16:55.190 --> 16:58.970
To gryff and bronwyn.

17:03.970 --> 17:06.999
If these things aren't comfortable, we can take them off.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.469
What's wrong with you?

17:08.470 --> 17:10.269
You know tradition doesn't allow it.

17:10.270 --> 17:12.319
It stays on until morning.

17:13.119 --> 17:16.790
After we've spent our first night together as man and wife?

17:18.520 --> 17:24.290
I too would like to offer my congratulations to the bride and groom.

17:24.839 --> 17:31.550
It is so wonderful to see a union of two souls.

17:31.630 --> 17:34.459
A union that, I have no doubt,

17:34.460 --> 17:39.770
Will honor darken rahl and all he so nobly fights for.

17:39.900 --> 17:43.890
Join me in raising a glass in tribute.

17:46.230 --> 17:48.580
To lord rahl.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.600
Lord rahl!

18:08.450 --> 18:11.020
I'm afraid there's some pressing business that I must attend to.

18:24.200 --> 18:28.489
There are a lot of things I want to say, but first let me start by

18:28.490 --> 18:35.750
Wishing my little sister and her new husband many,many children.

18:35.750 --> 18:38.670
And-- we should get started on that right away.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.859
I didn't realize you were so eager.

18:42.860 --> 18:45.110
Oh, I am. Believe me.

18:45.190 --> 18:46.570
Uh, shall we?

19:07.410 --> 19:10.530
I know this is gonna be really hard for you to believe,

19:11.710 --> 19:13.840
But I'm not who you think I am.

19:13.870 --> 19:16.000
My name is richard cypher.

19:16.820 --> 19:18.320
I'm the seeker.

19:19.370 --> 19:21.109
Right, and I'm the confessor.

19:21.110 --> 19:22.399
I'm telling you the truth.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.000
I don't know if it's a spell or some enchantment, but whatever it is,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.050
When people look at me, they think I'm gryff.

19:27.070 --> 19:29.830
Maybe that's because you are gryff.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.159
No, I'm the seeker.

19:34.160 --> 19:37.059
Now, it seems that you don't have a love for darken rahl,

19:37.060 --> 19:38.969
So will you please help me get out of here so

19:38.970 --> 19:41.419
I can get to kelabra and help fight the d'haran.

19:41.420 --> 19:42.879
I can't believe this.

19:42.880 --> 19:46.300
Do you actually think I wanted to marry you?

19:48.270 --> 19:49.890
Then why did you?

19:52.700 --> 19:56.110
This was all my brothers' idea.

19:57.140 --> 20:02.339
After our parents died, they expect this marriage to

20:02.340 --> 20:06.530
Save the family's future, even if it means ruining mine.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.240
I didn't know. I'm-- I'm sorry.

20:12.380 --> 20:14.110
You're sorry?

20:15.980 --> 20:17.650
I thought getting married

20:17.650 --> 20:20.710
Would at least mean I'd get out of my brother's house.

20:22.260 --> 20:26.190
That was before I knew I'd be locked to an insane person.

20:27.490 --> 20:29.130
God...

20:41.980 --> 20:43.450
Can't sleep?

20:45.020 --> 20:47.440
I'm worrying about tomorrow.

20:47.460 --> 20:49.539
I don't want anything to happen to you.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.660
How can anything happen to me?

20:51.770 --> 20:53.610
I have the sword of truth.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.290
And I have you.

21:01.580 --> 21:04.210
I'm afraid that might not be enough.

21:07.930 --> 21:09.460
What is it?

21:09.740 --> 21:13.829
To commemorate the victory at illya, the seeker of the third era

21:13.830 --> 21:17.610
Commissioned a magnificent dome to be built at aydindril.

21:17.980 --> 21:21.830
After 40 years of carefully placing the stones,

21:21.830 --> 21:26.140
All that remained was moving the last wouldn't support.

21:27.140 --> 21:29.930
Would all their work crumble to the ground,

21:29.930 --> 21:33.970
Or would it float among the clouds?

21:36.470 --> 21:39.979
The dome at aydindril has stood for thousands of years.

21:39.980 --> 21:43.000
I think the lesson is, if you want something to stand,

21:43.350 --> 21:46.830
You have to risk letting it fall.

21:53.950 --> 21:56.639
What would the seeker of the third era say

21:56.640 --> 21:59.630
About confessors that worry too much?

22:00.700 --> 22:02.930
I'm not too sure what he'd say.

22:03.330 --> 22:08.420
But this seeker would tell you that he'd die for you.

22:11.270 --> 22:12.899
Richard, no.

22:12.900 --> 22:15.890
You shouldn't say that. I can't help it.

22:15.890 --> 22:17.630
It's how I feel.

22:32.450 --> 22:33.790
I can't.

22:34.360 --> 22:35.519
We can't.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.659
Kahlan, wait.

22:36.660 --> 22:39.520
Richard, this can never happen.

22:40.650 --> 22:42.320
I'm sorry.

22:42.990 --> 22:45.450
Bronwyn, you were right.

22:45.610 --> 22:48.250
I shouldn't have pretended to be somebody else.

22:48.550 --> 22:51.129
But neither of us wants this.

22:51.130 --> 22:52.929
Well, what choice do we have now?

22:52.930 --> 22:54.870
We're stuck with each other.

22:55.860 --> 22:57.500
Maybe not.

22:59.180 --> 23:01.730
You said you wanted to see the world, right?

23:02.560 --> 23:04.029
Then let's go.

23:04.030 --> 23:05.300
Right now.

23:05.790 --> 23:07.779
When we get far enough away from here,

23:07.780 --> 23:10.970
We'll get this thing off and we can go our separate ways.

23:11.670 --> 23:13.649
This is solid gold.

23:13.650 --> 23:14.760
You can take it,

23:14.760 --> 23:17.970
And sell it for enough money to start whatever life you want.

23:18.740 --> 23:20.290
How?

23:22.680 --> 23:24.400
Out that window.

23:30.340 --> 23:33.109
How long do you think it'll take them to realize we're not there?

23:33.110 --> 23:35.569
I'm not sure. But we'll be long gone by then.

23:35.570 --> 23:38.210
You're not going anywhere.

23:42.990 --> 23:44.500
It's okay.

23:45.430 --> 23:48.850
Just, uh, don't hurt the girl.

23:56.700 --> 23:58.610
Drop it, seeker.

24:00.150 --> 24:02.640
Or the girl dies.

24:30.690 --> 24:31.940
You all right?

24:32.050 --> 24:34.790
That man, he called you "seeker."

24:37.150 --> 24:39.470
You were telling the truth before.

24:42.270 --> 24:44.340
You really are him.

24:56.290 --> 24:57.620
Take this.

24:58.250 --> 25:01.480
Now, will you be all right to get through the forest on your own?

25:02.820 --> 25:04.750
I'm coming with you.

25:04.990 --> 25:06.299
It's too dangerous.

25:06.300 --> 25:08.429
My friends will attack the demmin

25:08.430 --> 25:10.100
With someone who's not the seeker.

25:10.460 --> 25:11.569
I have to move quickly.

25:11.570 --> 25:13.119
Then you need me.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.119
I know a shortcut to kelabra.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.559
Through the caves.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.059
If your friends really are in danger,

25:18.060 --> 25:21.950
Then the fastest way for you to reach them is for me to take you

25:25.770 --> 25:28.860
These caves lead to the catacombs at kelabra.

25:37.070 --> 25:39.530
Never thought this is where I'd spend my honeymoon.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.769
Well, you and I aren't exactly married.

25:41.770 --> 25:43.840
I know, but this is the first time in my life

25:43.840 --> 25:45.970
I feel like I'm doing something important,

25:45.970 --> 25:49.799
Which is a lot better than being the wife of a merchant's son.

25:49.800 --> 25:51.989
Well, you don't know the real gryff.

25:51.990 --> 25:53.409
You should give him a chance.

25:53.410 --> 25:54.719
He's more than you think.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.679
I would rather go fight the d'harans than

25:56.680 --> 25:59.390
Marry someone I have nothing in common with

25:59.600 --> 26:02.780
Funny. Gryff said the same thing about you.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.090
What is it?

26:16.770 --> 26:18.080
Nothing.

26:18.090 --> 26:21.740
I don't have to be a confessor to know you're not telling the truth.

26:27.860 --> 26:30.320
Richard almost kissed me last night.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.789
This is exactly what I feared would happen.

26:36.790 --> 26:40.540
You cannot put off telling richard the truth any longer.

26:41.070 --> 26:42.820
I know.

26:45.090 --> 26:47.819
I'm just worried about the mission.

26:47.820 --> 26:49.759
I don't want this to be a distraction.

26:49.760 --> 26:52.780
Clearly it's already a distraction.

27:15.830 --> 27:22.209
Kahlan, I want to apologize for last night.

27:22.210 --> 27:26.160
No, I should be the one apologizing.

27:26.400 --> 27:29.150
It's okay if you don't feel the same way about me.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.460
No, that's not it.

27:35.290 --> 27:38.560
There's something I should have told you a long time ago.

27:44.370 --> 27:49.760
A confessor's power is always present.

27:50.720 --> 27:55.410
We have to hold it in at all times.

27:57.020 --> 27:58.780
Is that difficult?

27:59.200 --> 28:00.870
Yes.

28:02.020 --> 28:06.630
Especially if I were with someone I love.

28:10.910 --> 28:13.810
Then the power couldn't be controlled.

28:18.580 --> 28:20.120
In a moment of...

28:21.630 --> 28:26.530
...Ecstasy, it would be unleashed.

28:28.210 --> 28:30.860
My lover's soul would be taken.

28:31.630 --> 28:34.240
Then he would become a slave.

28:37.080 --> 28:39.630
That's why we can never be together.

28:42.370 --> 28:44.900
You wouldn't be yourself anymore.

28:47.790 --> 28:50.380
And you couldn't fulfill your destiny.

28:54.120 --> 28:56.090
I'm sorry, richard.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.840
General nass, it's a pleasure to have you with us.

29:27.090 --> 29:28.869
Pleasure is not why I'm here.

29:28.870 --> 29:30.220
Of course.

29:30.390 --> 29:33.450
You'll be happy to know our plans are ahead of schedule.

29:33.490 --> 29:34.649
Good.

29:34.650 --> 29:37.900
Then lord rahl will have his victory sooner than expected.

29:39.210 --> 29:42.019
The excavations are progressing well, commander.

29:42.020 --> 29:45.220
We believe the royal vault is just beyond the wall.

30:17.970 --> 30:19.949
Oh! What was that?

30:19.950 --> 30:22.529
We need to get out of here before the cave collapses!

30:22.530 --> 30:24.040
Come on.

30:51.020 --> 30:52.550
Jump!

31:02.870 --> 31:04.440
Gryff?

31:05.180 --> 31:06.950
You know these people?

31:07.120 --> 31:10.199
He's, uh-- he's the son of a local merchant.

31:10.200 --> 31:13.290
Very loyal to the d'haran cause.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.309
Or they're spies.

31:15.310 --> 31:16.910
Lock them up.

31:17.290 --> 31:19.400
I'll find out who they really are.

31:30.890 --> 31:33.919
You're supposed to be on your honeymoon, gryff.

31:33.920 --> 31:36.790
What could possibly have made you want to come here?

31:40.130 --> 31:42.119
I'd think you should be more concerned with how

31:42.120 --> 31:44.810
My father will react to you treating me this way

31:45.020 --> 31:46.889
He's always been loyal to you.

31:46.890 --> 31:49.490
Nass is determined to question you.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.410
There's nothing I can do.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.830
Then I guess there's nothing I can do, either.

31:55.070 --> 31:57.489
When nass questions me, I'm going to tell him

31:57.490 --> 32:00.280
All about the bribes my father has been paying you.

32:00.340 --> 32:02.110
Keep your voice down.

32:02.240 --> 32:05.129
There is nothing I can do.

32:05.130 --> 32:07.800
You can help me escape.

32:08.040 --> 32:11.970
I think we'd agree it'd be best if I wasn't here.

32:30.210 --> 32:32.330
Infantry, halt.

32:39.810 --> 32:42.849
Special provisions for commander morcant.

32:42.850 --> 32:45.360
That be delievered  to the commander tent.

33:12.060 --> 33:13.670
What are you looking for?

33:13.690 --> 33:14.720
There has to be something here

33:14.720 --> 33:17.290
That will tell us what nass is doing at kelabra.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.350
Richard, what does it say?

33:37.960 --> 33:39.660
I, uh...

33:40.650 --> 33:42.129
I can't read this.

33:42.130 --> 33:43.860
Of course you can.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.319
I don't even know what language this is.

33:48.320 --> 33:51.480
You've read it. It's the same as the book of counted shadows.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.650
Who are you?

34:14.360 --> 34:15.889
The fuse is lit.

34:15.889 --> 34:17.449
We can't go through with this.

34:17.449 --> 34:21.690
What are you talking about? He's not the seeker. He's gryff.

34:21.730 --> 34:24.690
I think that old woman must have done it to try to save Richard,

34:24.690 --> 34:27.418
To prevent her vision of the seeker's death from coming true

34:27.420 --> 34:29.100
The seeker's death?

34:29.690 --> 34:31.840
That's why the old woman did this?

34:31.870 --> 34:33.780
I'm supposed to die in his place?

34:33.780 --> 34:35.880
We have to abandon the mission.

34:38.699 --> 34:40.460
We're under attack!

34:40.800 --> 34:42.590
It's a little late for that.

34:50.719 --> 34:53.879
Get general nass to the command tent now!

34:53.880 --> 34:55.049
I have to get out of here.

34:55.050 --> 34:57.029
You can't. Nass is on his way.

34:57.030 --> 34:58.299
But I'm not the seeker!

34:58.300 --> 35:00.240
That won't matter to demmin nass.

35:10.730 --> 35:12.430
The seeker.

35:12.490 --> 35:15.040
No. No, I'm not him.

35:54.200 --> 35:55.370
Get up.

36:18.110 --> 36:19.340
You okay?

36:27.310 --> 36:30.190
The mines are collapsing. Where's the commander?

36:44.480 --> 36:45.860
Commander!

36:45.920 --> 36:47.650
The tunnels are collapsing.

36:51.050 --> 36:52.760
We have to move now.

36:53.300 --> 36:54.630
Come on.

37:04.010 --> 37:06.360
It appears the old woman's spell lasted just

37:06.360 --> 37:10.110
Just long enough to revert her vision of your death.

37:10.240 --> 37:14.580
It's been a long time since I've seen magic that powerful.

37:16.130 --> 37:19.239
Listen, what you told me last night,

37:19.240 --> 37:21.339
I know it was meant for richard, but..

37:21.340 --> 37:25.170
After worrying all this time, I told the wrong person.

37:26.100 --> 37:27.680
You should tell richard.

37:33.730 --> 37:35.380
This is for you.

37:36.300 --> 37:38.699
It tells the history of seekers past.

37:38.700 --> 37:40.970
I just wanted to say I'm sorry for...

37:40.970 --> 37:43.350
Going along with the old woman's plans.

37:43.790 --> 37:47.390
Now I know there's more to being the seeker than wielding a magic sword.

37:48.360 --> 37:50.439
I guess I just wanted to make a difference.

37:50.440 --> 37:52.710
You don't have to be the seeker to do that.

38:07.810 --> 38:09.580
I heard you got married.

38:10.910 --> 38:12.750
It was a lovely ceremony.

38:15.830 --> 38:19.490
I just had to do what I had to get back to you and Zedd.

38:19.590 --> 38:21.350
I'm glad you did.

38:24.210 --> 38:25.580
Are you all right?

38:26.610 --> 38:28.000
I'm fine.

38:28.130 --> 38:31.940
It appears the resistance has grown by two.

38:32.990 --> 38:36.160
Would've been three if we were able to confess demmin nass.

38:36.200 --> 38:39.189
The important thing is we kept gryff from harm

38:39.190 --> 38:42.429
And-- and averted the vision of the seeker's death

38:42.430 --> 38:44.100
Oh, we did more than that.

38:45.630 --> 38:47.180
We found this.

38:49.280 --> 38:51.950
Maybe it can tell us what he wanted at kelabra.

38:56.500 --> 38:59.990
It's a record of the day kelabra fell.

39:01.610 --> 39:06.270
With the walls crumbling, the kelabrans killed themselves

39:06.700 --> 39:09.430
To protect the city's greatest secret.

39:10.760 --> 39:13.490
And what is the secret?

39:13.710 --> 39:18.970
The final resting place of their greatest treasure.

39:20.140 --> 39:22.870
A box of orden.

39:27.390 --> 39:29.090
What is it?

39:33.480 --> 39:37.790
There are three boxes of orden.

39:38.190 --> 39:42.710
Each one contains unimaginably powerful magic.

39:45.350 --> 39:51.750
Whoever gains possession of all three boxes would be unstoppable.

39:53.390 --> 39:57.520
Darken rahl would enslave the entire world.

39:59.310 --> 40:01.980
He would be invincible.

40:05.960 --> 40:07.520
General nass.

40:08.520 --> 40:11.010
The seeker and the others have escaped into the forest.

40:16.300 --> 40:18.480
We have what we came for.

40:18.720 --> 40:20.920
We must bring lord rahl his prize.

40:21.080 --> 40:22.369
Prepare your men.

40:22.370 --> 40:24.840
We leave for the people's palace immediately.

40:28.710 --> 40:32.650
Soon lord rahl will have all three boxes,

40:32.650 --> 40:34.880
And the seeker will be finished.

40:41.530 --> 40:44.419
It's good to see you alive, seeker.

40:44.420 --> 40:47.009
You have my vision to thank for that.

40:47.010 --> 40:51.000
Your vision is the reason demmin nass got away with the box of orden.

40:51.050 --> 40:52.640
Shota!

40:52.840 --> 40:56.730
I feared it was you behind such diabolical magic.

40:57.050 --> 41:00.229
Zeddicus zu'l zorander.

41:00.230 --> 41:03.700
The years have not been kind.

41:10.520 --> 41:11.949
Zedd, you know her?

41:11.950 --> 41:14.089
Once, when I was a foolish young wizard

41:14.090 --> 41:16.329
And ventured into that seductress' lair

41:16.330 --> 41:17.999
Few have ever complained.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.640
Few have ever lived long enough to.

41:20.640 --> 41:23.300
I should've killed you when I had the chance.

41:23.300 --> 41:24.300
Who is she?

41:24.300 --> 41:27.639
A powerful sorceress who rules agaden reach,

41:27.640 --> 41:30.729
Using her twisted magic to shape events in her favor

41:30.730 --> 41:32.729
And she's no friend of the seeker!

41:32.730 --> 41:35.310
Nor am I a friend of darken rahl.

41:35.730 --> 41:40.960
If he gains dominion over this world, I'll be enslaved by his magic.

41:41.290 --> 41:43.360
I must help the seeker,

41:43.440 --> 41:46.859
For the prophecy says only he can defeat darken rahl

41:46.860 --> 41:48.599
Then why play these games?

41:48.600 --> 41:53.000
Zeddicus zu'l zorander would accept no help from me.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.729
With good reason.

41:54.730 --> 41:58.319
Hm! I suggest we get as far away from this witch as we possibly can.

41:58.320 --> 42:03.180
Oh, you can run from me, but you cannot run away from the prophecy.

42:04.190 --> 42:05.920
What are you talking about?

42:06.140 --> 42:07.969
I lived.

42:07.970 --> 42:10.079
We averted your prophecy.

42:10.080 --> 42:11.850
That was a vision.

42:12.090 --> 42:14.899
A momentary glimpse of a possible future.

42:14.900 --> 42:19.990
Something written in the halls of prophecy cannot be changed.

42:20.790 --> 42:22.969
And what is this prophecy?

42:22.970 --> 42:25.699
It is written that the seeker will be

42:25.700 --> 42:28.660
Betrayed by the one who is closest to him.

42:29.170 --> 42:34.370
You will be betrayed by the one in white.
