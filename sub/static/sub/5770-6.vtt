YEAH, I REMEMBER IT.

07:54.561 --> 07:57.128
HEY, I HAVE NOT SEEN YOU
IN FOREVER.

07:57.172 --> 07:58.173
HOW ARE THINGS?

07:58.216 --> 08:00.001
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HONESTLY, NOT SO GOOD.

08:00.044 --> 08:01.524
I WANT YOU TO LOOK
AT SOMETHING.

08:01.568 --> 08:02.525
OKAY.

08:02.569 --> 08:05.441
I JUST GOT BACK
FROM GREECE,

08:05.485 --> 08:08.836
AND I'M SCARED I MAY HAVE
CONTRACTED OLIVE FINGERS.

08:08.879 --> 08:09.837
OKAY.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.708
UM, THAT IS VERY SERIOUS.

08:11.752 --> 08:13.971
MY DIAGNOSIS IS THAT
YOU'RE A HUGE NERD.

08:14.015 --> 08:15.190
[laughs]

08:15.233 --> 08:17.148
HAVE YOU DONE THIS ROUTINE
FOR EVERYONE?

08:17.192 --> 08:20.108
NO, I-I JUST DID IT FOR YOU.

08:20.151 --> 08:23.546
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR HOW WEIRD OUR DATE WAS

08:23.590 --> 08:25.243
AND HOW I RAN OUT LIKE THAT.

08:25.287 --> 08:26.244
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

08:26.288 --> 08:28.769
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING WELL.

08:28.812 --> 08:29.770
REALLY?

08:29.813 --> 08:31.859
HEY, BABE.HEY.

08:31.902 --> 08:33.034
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.HI.

08:33.077 --> 08:34.688
I WAS JUST TAKING A WALK
OF GWEN'S GROUNDS.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.124
I WENT ALL THE WAY AROUND.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.560
WOW, COOL.

08:37.604 --> 08:40.650
OH, GEETA, THIS IS MINDY.
MINDY, THIS IS GEETA.

08:40.694 --> 08:41.999
HI, GEETA.

08:42.043 --> 08:42.913
NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:42.957 --> 08:44.349
HOW DO YOU KNOW
GWEN AND CARL?

08:44.393 --> 08:45.568
I WENT TO COLLEGE
WITH GWEN.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.222
I WENT TO PRINCETON TOO.
WHAT YEAR WERE YOU?

08:47.265 --> 08:49.180
MM.
2002.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.922
OH, NO.
WE DIDN'T OVERLAP.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.924
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING,
ARE YOU INDIAN?

08:53.968 --> 08:54.925
YEAH, BIG-TIME.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.884
LOVE TO SEE OTHER
BROWN GIRLS.

08:56.927 --> 08:58.059
NOT THAT HARD.

08:58.102 --> 09:00.583
THERE ARE LITERALLY
BILLIONS OF US.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.324
UM, HOW DID YOU TWO
MEET EACH OTHER?

09:02.367 --> 09:04.718
WE MET HERE, ACTUALLY,
THROUGH GWEN AND CARL.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.589
GWEN AND I
ARE REALLY CLOSE.

09:06.633 --> 09:10.245
I'M SORRY, YOU MET HERE
AT MY BEST FRIEND'S HOUSE,

09:10.288 --> 09:12.290
THROUGH MY BEST FRIEND?
HUH.

09:12.334 --> 09:15.076
THAT'S SO INTERESTING.
OKAY, WELL--

09:15.119 --> 09:16.512
UM, WHAT, MORGAN?

09:16.556 --> 09:17.948
YEAH, OKAY, I'M GONNA--

09:17.992 --> 09:19.341
I'LL COME HELP YOU
WITH IT.

09:19.384 --> 09:20.603
I'M GOING TO GO
HELP MORGAN IN THE KITCHEN.

09:20.647 --> 09:21.865
BIG DINNER,
CAN'T DO THAT ALL HIMSELF--

09:21.909 --> 09:23.824
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?
I'M RIGHT HERE.

09:23.867 --> 09:24.999
OH.

09:25.042 --> 09:27.305
MORGAN, ARE YOU
THROWING YOUR VOICE AGAIN?

09:27.349 --> 09:28.350
[laughs]

09:28.393 --> 09:29.481
WHAT?

09:29.525 --> 09:30.918
HE IS A CRAZY
TALENTED VENTRILOQUIST,

09:30.961 --> 09:33.616
BUT IT GETS US INTO TROUBLE
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS.

09:33.660 --> 09:34.791
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

09:34.835 --> 09:36.967
WHOA, I THOUGHT
THE LAMP WAS TALKING.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.534
HEY, I'M GOING TO HELP YOU
IN THE KITCHEN

09:38.578 --> 09:39.622
LIKE YOU ASKED ME TO.

09:39.666 --> 09:40.623
REMEMBER?

09:40.667 --> 09:42.494
OKAY, OKAY,
I'LL GO.

09:42.538 --> 09:45.149
BYE, GUYS.

09:47.325 --> 09:51.199
I, UH, GUESS
I SHOULD BE TAKING THIS.

09:51.242 --> 09:53.288
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S WEIRD, BUT
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS COMING.

09:53.331 --> 09:55.203
CARL INVITED DENNIS,
AND HE BROUGHT HER.

09:55.246 --> 09:58.119
LOOK, GWEN, IT WAS A GREAT
BEST-FRIENDSHIP, YOU KNOW?

09:58.162 --> 09:59.120
THANK YOU
FOR THE GOOD TIMES.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.512
WHAT?
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

10:00.556 --> 10:01.905
WHY DO WE ALWAYS HAVE TO GO
TO THIS DRAMATIC PLACE?

10:01.949 --> 10:03.298
I HAVE HOUSEGUESTS.

10:03.341 --> 10:05.126
CLEARLY, YOU HAVE TRADED ME IN
FOR A NEWER MODEL.

10:05.169 --> 10:07.041
I JUST HOPE THAT YOU HAVE
A GREAT RUN WITH MINDY 2.0.

10:07.084 --> 10:08.695
I DID NOT SET THEM UP.

10:08.738 --> 10:11.001
THEY MET ON OUR "DOORS
OF GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT" TOUR,

10:11.045 --> 10:12.437
WHICH, IF MEMORY SERVES,

10:12.481 --> 10:14.135
YOU REFERRED TO
AS "HONKY-PALOOZA."

10:14.178 --> 10:16.616
THAT IS HILARIOUS, BUT I DON'T
THINK THAT I SAID THAT.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.879
YOUR DATE WITH DENNIS
DID NOT GO WELL.

10:18.922 --> 10:20.097
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF.

10:20.141 --> 10:21.969
AND I AM MY OWN WORST CRITIC.
YOU KNOW THAT.

10:22.012 --> 10:23.013
REMEMBER THAT TIME
WE WENT TO KARAOKE,

10:23.057 --> 10:24.232
AND EVERYONE WAS LIKE,

10:24.275 --> 10:25.233
"MINDY, YOU ARE, LIKE,
A REALLY GOOD SINGER.

10:25.276 --> 10:26.277
YOU SHOULD DO THIS
PROFESSIONALLY."

10:26.321 --> 10:27.409
AND I WAS LIKE,
"NO, I'M A DOCTOR."

10:27.452 --> 10:29.977
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY YOU'RE FREAKING OUT.

10:30.020 --> 10:30.978
YOU'RE DATING JOSH.

10:31.021 --> 10:33.502
I AM.
BUT IT'S NOT EXCLUSIVE.

10:33.545 --> 10:35.373
WELL, DENNIS IS READY
TO SETTLE DOWN,

10:35.417 --> 10:37.158
AND CLEARLY,
HE HAS FOUND SOMEONE MORE--

10:37.201 --> 10:38.159
MORE WHAT?

10:38.202 --> 10:39.639
OKAY, LOOK.

10:39.682 --> 10:41.728
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL
AND SMART--

10:41.771 --> 10:42.729
GWEN, MORE WHAT?

10:42.772 --> 10:44.556
I'M NOT SAYING
YOU'RE A MESS.

10:44.600 --> 10:47.124
BUT I'M NOT SAYING
YOU'RE NOT.

10:50.084 --> 10:53.174
WELL, I AM GLAD TO KNOW
YOUR DIAGNOSIS, GWEN.

10:53.217 --> 10:56.699
AND I'M VERY HAPPY
TO KNOW WHAT I AM.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.701
COULD I, UH,
HAVE THE ROOM?

10:58.745 --> 11:00.921
SURE.
TAKE YOUR TIME.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.966
[door opens, closes]

11:03.010 --> 11:04.185
SORRY, GANG.

11:04.228 --> 11:06.491
WE HAD TO PUT GRANDMA
TO BED.

11:06.535 --> 11:08.276
BETWEEN EATING A NEW FOOD
AND MEETING A NEW GUY,

11:08.319 --> 11:10.626
WELL, UH, ALL THE EXCITEMENT WAS
JUST TOO MUCH FOR THE OLD GIRL.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.323
JEREMY AND I
ARE GOING TO GO TO CLACKER'S

11:12.367 --> 11:13.629
AND PLAY AIR HOCKEY.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.196
BUT WE HAVE AN AIR-HOCKEY TABLE
IN THE BASEMENT.

11:15.239 --> 11:16.980
THAT'S NOK HOCKEY!

11:17.024 --> 11:18.939
VOLUME, BETSY--YOUR GRANDMA'S
TRYING TO REST.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.984
[Grandma]
IS SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE?

11:21.028 --> 11:22.769
NOW THAT'S GONNA BE
A WHOLE THING.

11:22.812 --> 11:25.641
BETSY, I THINK MAYBE
CLACKER'S IS BEST LEFT

11:25.685 --> 11:27.382
FOR ANOTHER TIME.

11:27.425 --> 11:30.602
ON THANKSGIVING, WE PUTCHES,
WE--WE STICK TOGETHER.

11:30.646 --> 11:31.778
[laughter]

11:31.821 --> 11:32.909
HUH?

11:32.953 --> 11:36.870
HEY, GUYS.
IS, UH, DINNER READY YET?

11:36.913 --> 11:39.916
UH, MINDY, WHY ARE YOU
WEARING MY DRESS?

11:39.960 --> 11:41.657
I JUST FIGURED,
IF I'M GOING TO BE A MESS,

11:41.701 --> 11:43.137
MIGHT AS WELL BE
A HOT MESS, RIGHT?

11:43.180 --> 11:44.442
COULDN'T CHANGE, ANYWAY.

11:44.486 --> 11:46.967
I'M NOT WEARING ANY UNDERWEAR.
COULDN'T FIND ANY.

11:47.010 --> 11:47.968
DENNIS.

11:48.011 --> 11:49.709
TAKE A PICTURE,
WHY DON'T YOU?

11:49.752 --> 11:51.058
IT'LL LAST LONGER.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.233
YOU GROSS PERVERT.

11:52.276 --> 11:54.017
YOU ARE NOW COMPETING
WITH THAT TURKEY

11:54.061 --> 11:56.280
[British accent]
FOR THE BEST-LOOKING BIRD.

11:56.324 --> 11:58.630
DENNIS, YOU ARE BAD NEWS.
YOU ARE.

11:58.674 --> 12:00.720
I GOT TO WATCH OUT FOR YOU.

12:00.763 --> 12:03.026
MMM, DORIS, EVERYTHING
IS JUST WONDERFUL.

12:03.070 --> 12:05.681
AND, GENE, THANK YOU
SO MUCH AGAIN FOR THIS SHIRT.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.987
IT FEELS AMAZING.

12:07.030 --> 12:08.075
IT'S SO BILLOWY.

12:08.118 --> 12:09.903
WELL, I NOTICED YOU
ADMIRING MINE,

12:09.946 --> 12:12.470
SO I THOUGHT I'D LET YOU
TAKE ONE OUT FOR A SPIN, EH?

12:12.514 --> 12:14.995
REALLY MAKES YOU FEEL
LIKE A HANG-TEN DUDE.

12:15.038 --> 12:15.996
[laughs]QUITE.

12:16.039 --> 12:18.215
GENE, YOU ARE A STITCH.

12:18.259 --> 12:19.913
HEY, UM, JEREMY,

12:19.956 --> 12:23.917
WOULD YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
A SONG CALLED THE GOBBLE-WOBBLE?

12:23.960 --> 12:24.918
DAD!

12:24.961 --> 12:26.571
DAD!
YES.

12:26.615 --> 12:28.791
IT'S JUST A DUMB SONG
I MADE UP WHEN I WAS A KID.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.097
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER IT.

12:30.140 --> 12:32.273
COME ON, BETSY BEAR,
LET'S HEAR IT, HUH?

12:32.316 --> 12:33.665
[chanting]
BETSY BEAR.

12:33.709 --> 12:37.060
[all chanting]
BETSY BEAR, BETSY BEAR.

12:37.104 --> 12:37.931
BETSY BEAR--

12:37.974 --> 12:39.454
STOP CALLING ME BETSY BEAR!

12:39.497 --> 12:41.325
YOU STOPPED CALLING GORDON
"PICKLES."

12:41.369 --> 12:42.805
WELL, I DON'T EAT PICKLES
ANYMORE.

12:42.849 --> 12:45.373
I AM SICK OF BEING TREATED
LIKE A CHILD.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.418
[growls]

12:50.204 --> 12:51.205
EXCUSE ME.

HEY.

13:02.085 --> 13:03.913
I THOUGHT I'D FIND YOU

13:03.957 --> 13:05.349
WHY'S THAT?

13:05.393 --> 13:06.873
I CHECKED, LIKE,
FOUR PLACES BEFORE THIS.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.004
WHERE'S GEETA?

13:08.048 --> 13:09.353
[Dennis] SHE HAD TO GO.

13:09.397 --> 13:12.269
THERE WAS A BREAK-IN
REPORTED

13:12.313 --> 13:14.358

OH, MY GOD.

13:16.230 --> 13:17.797
YEAH.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.059
YOU KNOW,
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT

13:19.102 --> 13:21.322
THANKSGIVING WAS KIND OF
A ROMANTIC HOLIDAY,

13:21.365 --> 13:22.323
ACTUALLY.

13:22.366 --> 13:25.021
JUST LIKE THE COZY FIRES

13:25.065 --> 13:26.544
AND THE CRISP AUTUMN AIR.

YOU KNOW, MINDY,
YOU'RE A LOT DIFFERENT

JUST IMPULSIVE.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.303
I'M A LOT LIKE

13:53.354 --> 13:55.095
AH, THE EARTH.

WHERE SHOULD I LIVE NEXT?

13:59.403 --> 14:00.883

OH, GOD.

ANYONE THIS.

14:27.301 --> 14:28.824
ONE TIME I WAS ON
A FLIGHT,

14:28.868 --> 14:31.827
AND I WAS SO HUNGRY THAT
I TOLD THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT

14:31.871 --> 14:35.439
I WAS KOSHER 'CAUSE
