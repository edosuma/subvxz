<i>Max, Michael--

00:22.756 --> 00:26.215
<i>Isabel and Tess,
they landed here in 7947.</i>

00:26.292 --> 00:29.523
<i>They gestated in these really gross pods
for 4D years...</i>

00:29.596 --> 00:32.656

they sort of hatched.</i>

00:32.732 --> 00:36.032

who know about them.

00:50.817 --> 00:53.411

with them is like suicide.</i>

I mean, it's like typical bad
relationship stuff, but even weirder.

00:57.857 --> 01:00.383

romantic stuff they would have done...</i>

and getting married in Las Vegas.</i>
