09:41.219 --> 09:42.819

09:42.821 --> 09:45.288
IS MISTLETOE
OFFENSIVE?

09:45.290 --> 09:49.058
IS ANYONE OFFENDED
BY MISTLETOE?

09:50.562 --> 09:52.895

SCARE HIM.

10:21.226 --> 10:23.159
DUDE, SICK!

10:24.295 --> 10:26.462

10:41.479 --> 10:43.079
HOW OFFENDED
YOU ARE BY THEM.

10:43.081 --> 10:44.814
IN THIS WAY WE CAN
FIND OUT WHICH WORDS

10:44.816 --> 10:47.884
ARE LEAST OFFENSIVE
FOR USE IN THE HOLIDAY SEASON.

10:47.886 --> 10:49.218
ARE WE READY?

12:44.168 --> 12:47.370
I WANT TO TRY TO HELP YOU
CONFRONT YOUR PROBLEM.

12:47.372 --> 12:48.905
I DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM.

12:48.907 --> 12:51.107
WELL IT'S MY
UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU,

12:51.109 --> 12:54.744
YOU HAVE AN ACUTE CASE
OF<i> FECALPHILIA.</i>

12:54.746 --> 12:55.411
WHAT'S THAT?

12:55.413 --> 12:58.014
WELL, A FECALPHILIAC
IS SOMEBODY

12:58.016 --> 13:00.449
WHO'S OBSESSED WITH
<i>MOOKIE-STINKS,</i> KYLE.

13:00.451 --> 13:01.050
MOOKIE-STINKS?

13:01.052 --> 13:04.587
I ALSO UNDERSTAND YOU'RE
JEWISH, IS THAT RIGHT KYLE?

13:04.589 --> 13:05.421
NOT ON PURPOSE.

13:05.423 --> 13:08.124
SO THIS MUST BE A PRETTY HARD
TIME OF YEAR FOR YOU,

13:08.126 --> 13:09.292
BEING CHRISTMAS
AND ALL.

13:09.294 --> 13:11.227
DO THE OTHER KIDS
MAKE FUN OF YOU?

13:11.229 --> 13:12.328
SOMETIMES.

13:12.330 --> 13:14.196
THAT MUST
MAKE YOU MAD.

13:14.198 --> 13:14.697
SURE.

13:14.699 --> 13:16.565
MAD ENOUGH
TO KILL, KYLE?

13:16.567 --> 13:18.401
NO DUDE!

13:18.403 --> 13:19.769
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

13:19.771 --> 13:20.403
YOU SEE KYLE,

13:20.405 --> 13:22.204
SOMETIMES WE FEEL
LIKE AN OUTSIDER,

13:22.206 --> 13:25.374
WE CREATE FRIENDS, OKAY,
IN OUR MINDS, OKAY?

13:25.376 --> 13:27.610
BUT MR. HANKEY

SCREWED UP LITTLE KID.

13:43.161 --> 13:44.327
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

13:44.329 --> 13:47.496
SO TRY AND
STAY POSITIVE,

13:47.498 --> 13:50.466
STAY AWAY FROM
DRUGS AND ALCOHOL.

13:50.468 --> 13:51.467

14:00.678 --> 14:01.544
OKAY CHILDREN,

14:01.546 --> 14:03.679
WE JUST RECEIVED WORD
FROM THE MAYOR

14:03.681 --> 14:04.714

14:04.716 --> 14:06.849
CAN'T INCLUDE
ANY CHRISTMAS LIGHTS,

14:06.851 --> 14:09.485
SINCE THEY OFFEND
PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY.

14:09.487 --> 14:11.620
SO KENNY,
WOULD YOU PLEASE GO OVER

14:11.622 --> 14:14.924

14:17.595 --> 14:18.527
CAREFUL NOW KENNY,

14:18.529 --> 14:21.530

14:31.976 --> 14:32.875
NO, GO AWAY!

14:32.877 --> 14:36.178
STAN, YOU NEED TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR FRIEND.

14:36.180 --> 14:36.579
OKAY?

14:36.581 --> 14:39.181

THIS IS THE MOST GOD-AWFUL
PIECE OF CRAP I'VE EVER SEEN.

17:13.471 --> 17:15.337
HEY, YOU'RE THE ONES
WHO MADE IT THIS WAY.

17:15.339 --> 17:17.473
BECAUSE THE JEWS SAID
IT COULDN'T BE CHRISTIAN.

17:17.475 --> 17:20.042
IT WASN'T OUR IDEA TO
TAKE OUT SANTA CLAUS.

17:20.044 --> 17:21.977

17:49.840 --> 17:50.906
WE'RE BORED.

17:50.908 --> 17:52.241
THERE'S NOTHING
TO DO.

17:52.243 --> 17:54.443
WELL MAYBE
THIS WILL HELP.

17:54.445 --> 17:56.779

18:38.155 --> 18:39.355
AND MY BEST FRIEND
IS IN AN INSTITUTION.

18:39.357 --> 18:41.323
ALL BECAUSE WE DIDN'T
BELIEVE IN MR. HANKEY.

18:41.325 --> 18:43.592
