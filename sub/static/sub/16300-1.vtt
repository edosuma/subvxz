02:32.917 --> 02:35.166
Here I come!

02:35.167 --> 02:36.957
Here I come.

02:36.959 --> 02:38.079
Mrs Faulkner?

02:38.084 --> 02:40.134
Yes. Bella Faulkner.

02:41.542 --> 02:45.502
Bella, Paula Hall from Child Welfare
Services. This is Ricky Baker.

02:45.503 --> 02:47.916
Ricky Baker. Yes.

02:47.917 --> 02:51.287
Oh, here you are.

02:51.501 --> 02:53.081
Mm.

02:55.209 --> 02:59.128
Ricky, I'm Bella. Uh, you can call
me Bella, or Auntie, if you like,

02:59.129 --> 03:01.076
even though I'm not
your real auntie.

03:01.084 --> 03:03.916
But, you know, it's
a bit less formal.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.577
Whoo. You're a big fella!

03:05.584 --> 03:10.004
Who ate the guy who
ate all the pies, eh?

03:11.001 --> 03:12.001
Sorry.

03:12.751 --> 03:14.421
Well, he's nice.

03:14.792 --> 03:18.042
Yeah. Now, uh, obviously we've got a
couple of things to talk through, Bella.

03:18.084 --> 03:22.384
Clearly you've been briefed about his, uh,
background and also his foster care history.

03:22.417 --> 03:24.787
Apparently he's a bit of
a handful, a real bad egg.

03:24.834 --> 03:27.464
I mean, if you look at his file,
you'll see that for yourself.

03:27.501 --> 03:31.791
We're talking disobedience, stealing,
spitting, running away,

03:31.792 --> 03:36.791
throwing rocks, kicking stuff, defacing
stuff, burning stuff, loitering and graffiti.

03:36.792 --> 03:38.922
And that's just the
stuff we know about.

03:39.042 --> 03:42.752
But hopefully, uh, change in scene
will help straighten him out.

03:43.334 --> 03:45.134
He's home now. He'll be OK.

03:45.167 --> 03:48.417
OK. Well, I like your
enthusiasm. Good.

04:00.709 --> 04:03.249
Ricky, this is your new home.

04:03.542 --> 04:05.292
A real piece of work, this one.

04:05.417 --> 04:06.667
Ricky!

04:08.167 --> 04:10.877
There's no one else
who wants you, OK?

04:10.917 --> 04:15.247
Now, Ricky, you know what the
alternative is, don't you? Eh?

04:16.709 --> 04:20.829
Think you can make it work? 'Course we can.
We'll make it work.

04:28.709 --> 04:31.419
Move. Move it. Move!

04:32.792 --> 04:34.922
Yeah. I've been in
this game a long time.

04:34.959 --> 04:36.579
'No child left behind' is our motto.

04:36.626 --> 04:39.996
Well, it's not, you know, the official
motto, but it's definitely mine.

04:40.042 --> 04:43.632
Also, as part of the transition process,
I'll be needing to inspect your property,

04:43.667 --> 04:46.416
just to make sure that it's
up to our high standard.

04:46.417 --> 04:48.827
Looks fine. What do you think,
Constable Tappert?

04:49.792 --> 04:52.582
- Andy!
- Yeah, it looks cool.Yeah.

04:52.626 --> 04:56.746
We'll be coming in every eight weeks or so,
just to check in on, uh...

05:01.167 --> 05:03.247
Who's that Crocodile Dundee
guy over there?

05:03.251 --> 05:05.711
Oh, that's my husband, Hector.

05:05.751 --> 05:08.751
Whoa. He's giving
that pig a piggyback.

05:12.209 --> 05:17.129
Well, I see he has a rifle. Just
keep it away from this little guy.

05:17.542 --> 05:19.422
God knows what he's capable of.

05:19.876 --> 05:22.375
OK, he's all yours. No returns.

05:22.376 --> 05:24.036
Oh, I'm just joking.

05:24.042 --> 05:27.882
OK. You've got my number, so just, uh,
ring me if you've got any trouble. OK?

05:28.334 --> 05:29.384
Bye, Ricky.

05:31.584 --> 05:32.754
Bye, Ricky.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.579
Wow, what a shocker, eh

05:36.251 --> 05:38.081
OK, let's go, Andy.

05:44.459 --> 05:48.079
Ricky, this is Hec. You can
call him Uncle, if you like.

05:49.751 --> 05:51.421
No, he can't.

05:54.376 --> 05:56.746
What do you want to do?
Are you hungry?

05:57.751 --> 06:01.171
That's a silly question,
isn't it? Look at you.

06:22.501 --> 06:24.831
Mm?

06:30.126 --> 06:35.496
You ever worked on a farm before
or you just... ornamental?

06:36.834 --> 06:40.543
Hec. Just remember when we first met,
you weren't much good to anyone.

06:40.544 --> 06:43.792
Just a scruffy white drifter who
smelled like methylated spirits.

06:44.459 --> 06:45.709
Goodnight.

06:46.126 --> 06:48.076
Eh? What's that, dear?

06:49.376 --> 06:51.376
Goodnight.

06:52.792 --> 06:53.962
Oh...

06:55.501 --> 06:57.421
Jeez, Hec. You bloody idiot.

06:57.501 --> 06:58.541
What?

07:01.792 --> 07:02.792
Ricky?

07:03.459 --> 07:05.829
Buddy? Are you OK?

07:06.334 --> 07:09.504
Sorry about Hec. He's a
silly old goat, that's all.

07:10.417 --> 07:13.667
OK, well, I hope you
like your room, petal.

07:13.709 --> 07:16.918
They said you liked to read, so
I got a bunch of books for you,

07:16.919 --> 07:21.417
and you'll also notice an Indian lamp,
a bulldog lamp and some cats,

07:21.459 --> 07:24.329
and a nice sharp knife to
kill monsters in the night.

07:24.376 --> 07:27.727
I can't imagine what you've been through,
boy. You know, I can't imagine it was easy.

07:27.751 --> 07:29.711
But you're here now.
This is home.

07:30.626 --> 07:35.706
Anyway, it's really nice to have
you here, and I left a hottie in your bed.

07:35.751 --> 07:37.751
We'll see you in the morning.

07:38.542 --> 07:39.542
OK?

07:40.792 --> 07:42.082
OK, Ricky?

07:42.917 --> 07:43.917
OK.

07:44.917 --> 07:47.077
Nigh-night, then.
See you in the morning.

08:59.917 --> 09:05.917
Jeez, boy, it's a miracle we found you!
You made it all of 200m.

09:08.001 --> 09:09.791
I was just taking a break.

09:10.667 --> 09:12.247
Hec's cooking breakfast.

09:13.417 --> 09:19.077
Eggs, bacon, a few sossies
on the side,... pancakes.

09:21.751 --> 09:26.961
Come on. Have some breakfast,
then you can run away.

09:36.959 --> 09:39.919
Oh man. I got poop on my kicks.

09:41.292 --> 09:43.542
Go away, insect!

09:49.042 --> 09:51.672
Good pancake.

09:53.792 --> 09:56.002
So, what's your dog's name?

09:56.876 --> 09:57.956
Zag.

09:58.334 --> 10:00.794
You should get another
one and name it Zig.

10:03.542 --> 10:07.752
Bella told me to tell you that...
you should give me something to do.

10:07.753 --> 10:09.421
Is there anything
you want me to do?

10:09.584 --> 10:13.174
Yeah,... leave me alone.

10:16.292 --> 10:17.462
Cool.

11:01.126 --> 11:02.166
Morning.

11:02.167 --> 11:05.457
Morning. I thought
you were running away.

11:06.001 --> 11:09.331
I did, but I forgot something,
so I came back.

11:09.376 --> 11:13.326
Oh. Good for you, Ricky.
Good to see some initiative.

11:16.167 --> 11:18.287
You ever been up in
that jungle before?

11:18.501 --> 11:22.961
Oh, it's not a jungle; it's the bush. There's
about a million hectares of it, buddy.

11:23.167 --> 11:25.457
You said 'bush'.

11:26.126 --> 11:28.916
I'm from up there,
deep in the mountains.

11:29.209 --> 11:30.629
You ever go back much? Not for

11:30.667 --> 11:34.377
a long time. It's a
hard journey, easy to get lost.

11:34.626 --> 11:37.206
We got a lake up there
called Makutekahu.

11:37.542 --> 11:40.382
It's so high up it wets
the cloak of the sky.

11:40.459 --> 11:43.879
It's the first place our spirits
go on their way to Reinga.

11:44.334 --> 11:48.004
Yeah, when my time comes,
that's where I'll go too.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.500
Man, you guys got a lot
of dead stuff round here.

11:52.501 --> 11:56.501
Mm. Saw a dead sheep the other day.
Had maggots in it.

11:57.251 --> 11:59.961
There's heaps of maggots,

12:00.334 --> 12:03.384
maggots wriggling in that sheep

12:03.751 --> 12:08.081
like moving rice. Yuck.

12:09.042 --> 12:12.962
That was my haiku about maggots.

12:13.084 --> 12:15.044
It's called 'Maggots'.

12:15.667 --> 12:20.417
This counsellor lady made me
do them when I got in trouble.

12:20.501 --> 12:23.041
They help me express
my feelings.

12:23.042 --> 12:26.132
They're poems made up of...
Yeah. I know what a haiku is.

12:27.209 --> 12:30.379
I got heaps of them...
want to hear another one?

12:30.417 --> 12:31.077
Sure.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.211
OK.

12:34.042 --> 12:35.632
'Kingi, you wanker.

12:35.751 --> 12:38.711
'You arsehole.
I hate you heaps.

12:39.167 --> 12:41.577
'Please die soon in pain.'

12:42.292 --> 12:44.882
That was called
'Kingi, you Wanker'.

12:44.917 --> 12:47.917
Yeah, yeah. OK. Got ya. Got ya.
That's enough haikus for today.

12:48.542 --> 12:50.962
Come on. Sit down.
Come and give me a hand.

12:52.709 --> 12:54.749
Well, it's like this,

12:55.917 --> 12:59.417
and then you put it in this bag.

12:59.542 --> 13:00.632
Easy.

13:01.334 --> 13:02.634
Here you go. You have a go.

13:06.084 --> 13:07.754
Do you want to
try something else?

13:08.292 --> 13:09.502
Yes, please.

13:11.584 --> 13:16.504
I'm imagining I'm a Maori warrior, and that
bottle over there is a British soldier,

13:16.505 --> 13:18.961
and I'm defending all my wives.

13:19.542 --> 13:21.708
All right, Te Kooti.

13:21.709 --> 13:25.459
Well, you just keep the target above
the little notch in the sight.

13:25.501 --> 13:27.881
And then when you're ready,
you just breathe...

13:29.709 --> 13:30.919
Bloody hell!

13:31.501 --> 13:32.631
So, what are we hunting?

13:32.632 --> 13:36.326
Oh, anything.
Deer, if we're lucky.

13:36.376 --> 13:38.536
Can we shoot one of
those horses up there?

13:38.542 --> 13:40.832
Oh, I'll give... I'll give you one
guess what my answer will be.

13:40.834 --> 13:43.294
Well, can I ride one?

13:43.334 --> 13:46.794
Nobody can ride them;
they're too wild.

13:46.834 --> 13:48.504
Why do they need
to be ridden, anyway?

13:48.542 --> 13:50.379
Well, that's what
they're there for.

13:50.380 --> 13:53.876
Why can't they just eat grass and
be horses and leave it at that, eh?

13:53.917 --> 13:56.287
OK, OK. I was just
making conversation.

13:56.292 --> 13:57.382
ZAG BARKS Shh.

13:58.584 --> 14:00.674
Pig! Come on!

14:00.709 --> 14:02.249
What?

14:30.292 --> 14:33.712
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
That's dinner sorted!

14:33.959 --> 14:35.789
Whoa! Want to help me gut it?

15:37.667 --> 15:43.167
Hector, do you think it's time
we gave Ricky his present?

15:55.542 --> 15:57.582
Thank you, Auntie!
Thank you, Uncle!

15:57.626 --> 16:01.536
Feed him, clean up after him.
He's yours... you're responsible.

16:01.542 --> 16:03.882
This is the best
birthday I've ever had.

16:05.126 --> 16:07.376
I think it's the only
birthday I've ever had.

16:11.917 --> 16:13.167
What are you gonna call him?

16:13.501 --> 16:17.421
Um, still thinking. Something fierce to
reflect its true nature.

16:17.626 --> 16:21.536
Either Psycho, Megatron...
or Tupac.

16:22.251 --> 16:23.581
What's a Tupac?

16:23.751 --> 16:27.751
It's just my... this really cool rapper,
and he's, like, my best friend.

16:29.917 --> 16:31.707
Are you gonna run away tonight?

16:32.792 --> 16:33.792
Not sure.

16:34.042 --> 16:35.882
No, oh, it's cool with me.

16:36.459 --> 16:38.629
Just make sure you're
back by breakfast.

16:40.001 --> 16:41.081
OK.

16:41.626 --> 16:44.076
So happy we found you, buddy.

16:44.126 --> 16:46.126
Sorry it took so long.

16:47.167 --> 16:48.167
Me too.

16:51.542 --> 16:52.791
Nigh-night, Ricky.

16:52.792 --> 16:54.542
Night, Auntie.

17:31.251 --> 17:34.041
Where are you going, Tupac?

17:35.751 --> 17:38.081
Come on.

17:38.542 --> 17:39.672
Man!

17:40.292 --> 17:41.962
Ohhh!

17:42.042 --> 17:43.752
Oh, Bella!

18:09.459 --> 18:11.749
You know, sometimes in life,

18:13.542 --> 18:15.502
it seems like
there's no way out...

18:17.584 --> 18:22.214
like a sheep trapped in
a maze designed by wolves.

18:23.584 --> 18:25.924
And you know that if
you're ever in that situation,

18:25.959 --> 18:28.879
there are always
two doors to choose from.

18:29.501 --> 18:30.881
And through the first door...

18:30.959 --> 18:33.289
oh, it's easy to get through that door
and on the other side waiting

18:33.292 --> 18:36.422
for you are all the nummiest
treats you can imagine.

18:36.459 --> 18:41.749
Fanta, Doritos, L&P,
Burger Rings, Coke Zero.

18:42.209 --> 18:44.629
But you know what?
There's also another door,

18:44.630 --> 18:47.706
not the Burger Ring door,
not the Fanta door;

18:47.751 --> 18:50.171
another door that's
harder to get through.

18:50.917 --> 18:52.787
Guess what's on the other side?

18:53.251 --> 18:55.251
Anyone want to take a guess?

18:57.959 --> 18:59.459
Vegetables?

19:01.126 --> 19:04.286
N-No, not vegeta...

19:05.542 --> 19:06.542
No.

19:07.709 --> 19:13.329
You would think Jesus. I thought Jesus the
first time I-I-I-I came across that door.

19:13.376 --> 19:15.916
It's not Jesus.
It's another door.

19:16.626 --> 19:19.166
And guess what's on the
other side of that door?

19:22.251 --> 19:23.251
Jesus.

19:23.501 --> 19:24.881
Jesus. Yeah, Jesus.

19:25.209 --> 19:27.039
He's tricky like that, Jesus.

19:28.376 --> 19:29.826
So let us pray,

19:30.376 --> 19:35.206
to Jesus, please, and make it a bit easier
to get through those doors, uh, to find you

19:35.209 --> 19:38.749
and your bounty of
delicious confectionary.

19:39.626 --> 19:41.576
Thank you, Selena.
Take it away.

21:00.376 --> 21:02.076
Dinner. It's a bit burnt.

21:10.667 --> 21:12.247
Here.

21:14.542 --> 21:15.792
Read this.

21:16.751 --> 21:18.881
Out loud.

21:20.917 --> 21:23.247
'From the
Child Welfare people.

21:23.792 --> 21:28.382
'Mr Hector Faulkner.'This is Paula
Hall from Child Welfare writing to you.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.707
'I'm sorry to hear about
your recent bereavement.

21:30.709 --> 21:33.669
'However, in light of
the altered circumstances,

21:33.709 --> 21:37.379
'the current situation regarding
Ricky's care will have to be reviewed.

21:37.417 --> 21:41.287
'As of June the 1st, I will be taking
him back into state custody

21:41.459 --> 21:43.829
'until alternative arrangements
can be made.

21:43.834 --> 21:47.294
'Rest assured I am working tireless
to find a new home for Ricky.

21:47.334 --> 21:52.254
'And you can expect a visit next
week for Ricky's collection.

21:52.292 --> 21:57.042
'Sincerely, Paula Hall,
Ministry of Child Welfare.'

21:57.709 --> 21:59.749
Like hell! They can't do that!

22:00.292 --> 22:01.666
Yeah, they can.

22:01.667 --> 22:05.127
But I live here now.
It's my home!

22:05.167 --> 22:10.287
Not any more, it isn't. Not in their eyes.
Not without a woman to run the show.

22:11.709 --> 22:15.669
Why don't we just get you a new wife?
There's plenty of ladies on the internet, I heard.

22:18.251 --> 22:19.381
Too soon?

22:19.459 --> 22:22.579
What if we just keep living here,
and if they try to take the farm,

22:22.626 --> 22:24.536
we'll just have a
shootout, like Scarface.

22:24.542 --> 22:26.129
Except we don't
have any cocaine.

22:26.130 --> 22:28.496
You can't change this, Ricky.
You're gonna go back,

22:28.584 --> 22:30.754
and you're gonna stick it out
in a new home. OK?

22:30.792 --> 22:32.502
There's no way that's happening.

22:32.709 --> 22:34.539
Well, I'm gonna go bush. I'm
gonna...

22:34.584 --> 22:36.504
...disappear for a while.

22:36.584 --> 22:40.174
Disappear?
Yeah, that sounds more like me.

22:42.167 --> 22:44.417
Come on! We'll be a team!

22:44.459 --> 22:47.289
Oh, for God's sake. You wouldn't
last five minutes out there.

22:47.751 --> 22:51.381
But Auntie Bella said
you had to look after me!

22:52.167 --> 22:54.037
Can you just give
me some privacy?

23:07.584 --> 23:10.424
I heard they do experiments
at the Boys' Home...

23:10.459 --> 23:12.669
waterboarding, torture,
that sort of thing.

23:12.709 --> 23:17.169
This one boy got thrown acid on his face
because he asked for more Weet-Bix.

23:18.792 --> 23:21.170
Hey, you can't put
Auntie in a box.

23:21.171 --> 23:23.417
Give it a rest. But she wanted to go
to the sky place.

23:23.459 --> 23:26.579
She's gone, OK? That's life...

23:27.459 --> 23:31.539
one day you're here, and the
next you're in a bloody box.

23:33.126 --> 23:35.996
Just get this into
your head, boy...

23:36.501 --> 23:39.581
it was Bella that wanted
you here, not me.

23:39.667 --> 23:42.537
I know you think this
can work, but it can't.

23:45.876 --> 23:49.746
So the welfare people are coming on Friday.
They're coming to get you.

23:52.584 --> 23:54.214
That's that, then?

23:54.251 --> 23:56.461
Yep... that's that.

24:23.792 --> 24:24.882
That's that.

24:57.376 --> 25:00.496
Goodbye, Ricky Baker.

25:04.459 --> 25:06.039
Uh-oh.

Can't wait.
I hate it here...

28:12.959 --> 28:14.629
so much dirt.

28:14.876 --> 28:16.326
It's going to be cool.

28:16.376 --> 28:22.666
Get me some new gears, become a drug
dealer, a rapper, and die in a drive-by.

28:22.709 --> 28:24.919
Just keep an eye on
where you're going.

28:29.709 --> 28:30.749
This is wet.

28:31.834 --> 28:34.791
I'm hungry.
Where are we?

28:34.792 --> 28:35.922
Shut it.

28:36.417 --> 28:38.077
I hate the bush.

28:38.126 --> 28:39.126
Shut it.

28:40.667 --> 28:42.207
My shoes are wet.

28:42.251 --> 28:46.711
You're the useless bugger who got lost
in the first place. You remember that.

28:47.042 --> 28:49.542
You don't even have a map.
Where's our map?

28:49.584 --> 28:51.834
Don't need one.
I know where I am.

28:52.417 --> 28:55.167
Probably couldn't
even read it anyway.

28:55.334 --> 28:57.214
Why would I need to read a map?

28:57.251 --> 29:01.460
I already told you... I know where I am.
Reading is stupid anyway.

29:01.461 --> 29:04.629
Only people who can't read
say things like that.

29:09.292 --> 29:10.292
What?

29:11.501 --> 29:14.375
No. You can't read?!

29:14.376 --> 29:15.126
Watch it now!

29:15.167 --> 29:19.037
You're like one of those people who are, like,
raised by, like, wolves or something, eh?

29:19.084 --> 29:21.714
Ooga booga! Me Hec...
me no read!

29:22.459 --> 29:25.789
What's this? This is words.
Me stupid.

29:25.834 --> 29:28.794
You little....!

29:31.959 --> 29:33.629
- Ah, my foot.
- You OK?

29:33.709 --> 29:35.329
No. I'm not OK.

29:35.376 --> 29:39.286
This is all your fault, you little bastard!

29:39.417 --> 29:41.707
Come on, let's get
you comfortable.

29:58.042 --> 30:00.170
I don't really think
you're a bastard.

30:00.171 --> 30:03.997
Yeah, you do. That's OK, because
I think you're a bastard too.

30:04.376 --> 30:08.206
Anyway, it's good. It's... healthy
to get these feelings out.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.752
Can you move it yet?'

30:11.792 --> 30:15.672
Course I can't. It's fractured.
Take weeks to heal.

30:16.001 --> 30:19.251
OK, Debbie Downer, can we think
of something more positive?

30:20.001 --> 30:23.416
Maybe you could... write a
haiku to express your feelings.

30:23.417 --> 30:24.417
A what?

30:27.667 --> 30:29.827
Lost in the forest.

30:30.876 --> 30:34.286
A sore ankle, poor uncle.

30:34.792 --> 30:37.252
Oh well, never mind.

30:37.751 --> 30:40.211
Oh God, we really need
to get out of here.

30:40.251 --> 30:41.501
Do you want me to go find help?

30:43.459 --> 30:44.629
I'd die, wouldn't I?

30:44.834 --> 30:47.584
No, we've got no choice but to
camp out here for a few weeks.

30:47.626 --> 30:48.626
But I'm hungry!

30:49.042 --> 30:51.041
There's plenty to eat
if you know where to look.

30:51.042 --> 30:52.962
Well, I don't know where
to look Hector.

30:53.251 --> 30:55.750
And also, I ran out of toilet paper.
Give me some of yours.

30:55.751 --> 30:56.671
Eh?

30:56.709 --> 31:00.329
I've gotta poop. I need a poop,
you need a poop. We all poop.

31:00.334 --> 31:01.884

31:01.959 --> 31:03.249
A leaf?

31:03.459 --> 31:05.749
I hate you.

31:06.251 --> 31:07.211
And bury it!

31:07.212 --> 31:08.919
I'll bury you.

31:14.834 --> 31:17.214
This ain't no
charred foster kid.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.421
How can you tell, Paula?

31:20.084 --> 31:22.924
Does this look like a
human head to you, Andy?

31:28.126 --> 31:29.496
Where are you, Ricky Baker?

31:29.501 --> 31:33.421
Hey, I reckon the old man chopped him up,
buried him somewhere...

31:35.459 --> 31:36.459
Or ate him.

31:37.292 --> 31:39.422
Something definitely happened,

31:40.084 --> 31:41.421
but I'm wondering what.

31:41.422 --> 31:45.537
OK, I'm gonna need you to shutup, Andy,
because you're doing my frickin' head in.

31:46.334 --> 31:47.750
Come on, let's go.

31:47.751 --> 31:50.461

Hey, whoa, Paula.
I am the police.

34:22.376 --> 34:23.666
Oh, it's a way of, um...

clothes are slowing them down.

Jeez, eh. Whoo.

38:08.626 --> 38:10.626
Got a lot of explaining to do.

38:10.667 --> 38:12.497
A lot of people
looking for you two.

38:12.542 --> 38:13.542
Yeah, we know.

38:14.792 --> 38:18.832
I did my ankle back in one of the valleys.
And, uh, we're on the way out now.

38:22.501 --> 38:23.711
Well,...

38:25.542 --> 38:27.832
wait till they hear
we caught you in a hut.

38:30.709 --> 38:31.829
Well, we weren't hiding,

38:31.876 --> 38:35.036
The boy got himself lost,
and, uh, I'm bringing him back.

38:35.084 --> 38:39.044
Whoa. Cool gun, bro.

38:39.334 --> 38:42.174
What do you guys shoot with this?
Sparrows?

38:42.209 --> 38:44.499
Mm, sometimes.

38:47.709 --> 38:48.879
He hurt you, son?

38:49.376 --> 38:51.786
Nah. I fell in some
prickles one time.

38:51.792 --> 38:53.382
Did he push you
in those prickles?

38:53.459 --> 38:56.128
Yeah, probably. Did he push
you in the prickles, mate?

38:56.129 --> 38:57.166
Leave him alone.

38:57.209 --> 38:58.829
You shut your trap, old fulla.

38:59.917 --> 39:02.747
I'd go get some rest if I was you.
You've got a long walk tomorrow.

39:03.542 --> 39:07.002
First of all, you
watch how you talk to me.

39:07.751 --> 39:08.831
And second of all,

39:09.376 --> 39:11.626
you can take him,
but I'm staying here.

39:12.001 --> 39:14.171
Like hell. People want answers.

39:14.209 --> 39:15.629
Yeah, answers.

39:15.709 --> 39:19.289
Look, we got lost; I got injured.
He's fine. It was basically a holiday.

39:19.334 --> 39:22.254
Not a real holiday,
because he made me do stuff.

39:24.834 --> 39:25.834
Like what?

39:26.084 --> 39:30.334
Just stuff. He had a sore leg,
so he made me do things for him.

39:30.709 --> 39:36.999
It was hard at first, because my hands
are so soft. But I got used to it.

39:37.417 --> 39:41.497
I didn't really want to do it,
but it was the only way to survive.

39:43.042 --> 39:46.672
Well, it wasn't always hard.
Sometimes I got to do my own thing.

39:47.167 --> 39:49.997
He pretty much never
joined in with me, though.

39:50.001 --> 39:52.331
I asked if he wanted
to play with me, but...

39:53.959 --> 39:56.459
he would just make
me play with myself.

39:59.167 --> 40:00.957
I feel sick. I feel sick, Hugh.

40:01.001 --> 40:03.961
Well... Hang on. He doesn't
know what he means.

40:04.001 --> 40:05.791
You're a bloody pervert.

40:05.834 --> 40:06.754
What did you call me?

40:06.755 --> 40:08.961
You heard him. Yeah, you
heard him, you old perv.

40:09.001 --> 40:11.131
Hey! He's not a pervert,
you dickhead!

40:11.167 --> 40:11.787
Shut up Ricky.

40:11.834 --> 40:13.174
Yeah, shut up, Ricky.

40:13.209 --> 40:15.249
Hey, only I get to
tell him to shut up.

40:15.251 --> 40:17.001
Oooh. Brainwasher.

40:20.292 --> 40:22.172
You're going to jail,
you pervert.

40:22.209 --> 40:24.379
Want to say that again?

40:24.417 --> 40:26.207
Say it again.

40:26.501 --> 40:27.961
Going to jail,...

40:32.334 --> 40:34.084
you pervert.

40:44.334 --> 40:47.174
Get off, you mongrel!

40:48.792 --> 40:50.832
Shit just got real!

40:51.167 --> 40:53.827
Back up, homies, and
let go of my uncle!

40:53.876 --> 40:57.666
It's OK, kid. You can put it down.
He won't hurt you anymore.

40:58.459 --> 41:01.959
I said get away from my uncle.

41:02.001 --> 41:05.001
Ricky, give me that.

41:07.001 --> 41:08.041
Get down!

41:08.792 --> 41:13.502
Ricky, get their guns. Take the bolts out.
We're getting out of here.

41:14.917 --> 41:19.497
Yeah. Shit just got real.

41:20.042 --> 41:21.042
Hey!

41:21.834 --> 41:23.214
You're dead, old man.

41:23.251 --> 41:26.421
Yeah, dead meat, you old perv!

41:30.001 --> 41:33.671
You've had it, mate!
There's no chance for you!

41:34.709 --> 41:37.079
Get up.

41:39.542 --> 41:42.582
Straight up that was the most
gangster shit I've ever done.

41:42.584 --> 41:46.254
You idiot. And what were you talking about
back there? Do you know what that sounds like?

41:46.292 --> 41:47.332
No!

41:49.042 --> 41:50.172
Ohhh!

41:50.251 --> 41:51.518
They're gonna put
me away for sure.

41:51.542 --> 41:53.422
Bastards. Yeah, bastards.

41:53.459 --> 41:55.419
Hear what that guy called me?
Pervert!

41:55.459 --> 41:56.289
We need more guns,...

41:56.292 --> 41:57.382
Oh God. What am I gonna do?

41:57.417 --> 41:58.417
Hand grenades,...

41:58.459 --> 42:01.539
maybe a rocket launcher.
They're gonna come for us.

42:01.542 --> 42:02.582
Yeah, Police.

42:02.626 --> 42:03.536
Awesome.

42:03.584 --> 42:05.714
No, it's not awesome,
Ricky, it's serious.

42:05.751 --> 42:07.879
Yeah, but no one got hurt.
You're not dangerous.

42:07.880 --> 42:09.496
Yeah, well, I am to them.

42:10.001 --> 42:10.791
I've been to prison.

42:10.792 --> 42:13.132
Gangster! For what?

42:13.501 --> 42:14.541
Manslaughter.

42:14.584 --> 42:16.634
Double gangster!
You need a teardrop tattoo.

42:16.667 --> 42:19.247
Oh, I was young.
It was a drunken fight.

42:19.751 --> 42:22.461
Did my time, but...
they won't see it like that.

42:22.751 --> 42:24.750
I'll just tell them you
were looking after me.

42:24.751 --> 42:26.727
It doesn't matter what you tell them;
they won't believe you.

42:26.751 --> 42:28.381
They'll think I made you do it.

42:28.876 --> 42:30.956
I'm not going back to jail.
I'm better off up here.

42:31.334 --> 42:34.084
This is no place for a kid.
You're going to have to go back, Ricky.

42:34.126 --> 42:34.916
To what?

42:34.959 --> 42:36.789
- Well, to the welfare people.
- No.

42:36.834 --> 42:38.292
- They'll look after you.
- No, they won't.

42:38.293 --> 42:39.672
They'll find you another home.
You'll be fine.

42:39.673 --> 42:41.417
No. You're not listening!

42:41.459 --> 42:44.749
Nobody listens. There's no
more homes, just juvie!

42:44.792 --> 42:46.172
What's juvie?

42:46.376 --> 42:48.376
Juvenile prison.

42:50.001 --> 42:52.169
They don't care
about kids like me.

42:52.170 --> 42:54.417
They just keep moving
us around until...

42:54.459 --> 42:57.829
something happens,
like... Amber.

43:03.501 --> 43:06.001
Oh, no. Bugger that.

43:07.876 --> 43:11.826
OK, OK. We're in about a million
hectares of bush... that's big.

43:11.876 --> 43:13.826
It's big enough to hide in
for a while, anyway.

43:13.876 --> 43:14.826
Good enough for me.

43:14.834 --> 43:16.004
But we're heading into winter.

43:16.005 --> 43:18.501
It's gonna be rough... no huts,
no tents, real bush life.

43:18.542 --> 43:19.502
Can you handle that?

43:19.542 --> 43:20.582
I can handle it.

43:20.667 --> 43:23.747
Yeah. And if you
play up, I dump ya.

43:23.792 --> 43:24.632
OK, Uncle.

43:24.667 --> 43:26.787
I'd still prefer if
you don't call me Uncle.

43:26.834 --> 43:30.334
OK, Hec. So what do we do now?

43:30.917 --> 43:32.457
We run.

43:37.501 --> 43:38.461
Wait, wait, wait.

43:38.501 --> 43:39.958
No, no.

43:39.959 --> 43:41.129
No, we don't need to run.

43:41.130 --> 43:44.326
Oh yeah.

45:56.501 --> 45:58.211
Majestical? Sure it is.

45:58.751 --> 46:00.291
Nah, it's not real.

46:00.667 --> 46:02.247
What would you know?

46:02.584 --> 46:04.254
It's 'majestic.'

46:04.792 --> 46:06.832
Well, that doesn't
sound very special.

46:07.584 --> 46:09.754
'Majestical' is way better.

46:11.501 --> 46:13.631
What do you reckon this
place is called, anyway?

46:14.501 --> 46:18.750
Do you think it's that place where the
cloak gets wet by the sky or something?

46:18.751 --> 46:20.431
I don't know. What the
hell does that mean?

46:20.792 --> 46:22.792
Auntie Bella said she
was from up here...

46:22.917 --> 46:25.627
from this special lake
that almost touches the sky.

46:25.709 --> 46:28.789
Mate, Bella didn't
know where she was from.

46:28.792 --> 46:29.916
Nah, she said...

46:29.917 --> 46:31.457
No. She was making it up.

46:31.584 --> 46:36.884
Look... Bella didn't have any
family. Like you. Like me.

46:37.167 --> 46:41.457
That's why she wanted to look after you...
and took pity on me.

46:41.709 --> 46:45.789
She wanted to save us poor wretches
when no one else wanted us.

46:47.126 --> 46:49.206
Like rescue dogs.

46:51.126 --> 46:54.536
That's the way she was.
Heart of gold.

47:01.001 --> 47:03.291
Yeah, it's majestical.

47:05.542 --> 47:07.672
May as well camp, eh?

47:08.876 --> 47:10.746
Sun is going down.

47:18.126 --> 47:22.166
Developing story now,
more on this massive national manhunt.

47:22.209 --> 47:26.039
Yes, we've got Paula Hall from
the Department of Child Welfare with us.

47:26.084 --> 47:27.630
Paula, thank you
for being here...

47:27.631 --> 47:31.076
Tell us about this boy. What kind
of character are we talking about?

47:31.126 --> 47:31.826
Well, look, we're...

47:31.876 --> 47:35.246
We're talking about a young boy
who is capable of stealing,

47:35.251 --> 47:39.671
spitting, breaking stuff,
kicking stuff, defacing stuff,

47:40.126 --> 47:45.875
stealing stuff, burning stuff and, uh,
loitering and graffiti-ing. Yeah.

47:45.876 --> 47:49.786
Mm. Even so, Paula, he's just a kid, right?
He's alone in the bush. He's scared.

47:49.792 --> 47:53.502
Scared? No, no. He's not...
He's not a scared little kid.

47:53.542 --> 47:56.632
He's a spanner in the works, and I'm the
mechanic who is gonna take that spanner

47:56.633 --> 47:58.875
and put him back in the toolbox...
OK...

47:58.876 --> 48:03.876
Where here he belongs.
No child left behind. No child left behind.

48:03.917 --> 48:05.747
No child left behind.

48:07.626 --> 48:09.326
He'll know what that means.

48:09.876 --> 48:11.206
OK.

48:23.792 --> 48:24.792
Any luck?

48:25.042 --> 48:27.172
We're somewhere
in this green bit.

48:28.751 --> 48:31.961
Well, people used to live here,
so we can't be that lost.

48:32.959 --> 48:35.919
They probably got lost too,
and then just gave up.

48:36.626 --> 48:38.576
We'll probably die here.

48:38.626 --> 48:39.956
Well, anything to shut you up.

48:40.001 --> 48:42.961
I'll shut up if that
stupid bird shuts up.

48:43.876 --> 48:46.166
Shut up, stupid bird!

48:46.209 --> 48:47.209
Shh.

48:47.417 --> 48:48.417
Just watch.

48:49.376 --> 48:52.706
Huh. Never seen a dumb
bird like that before.

48:54.876 --> 48:56.706
Just watch.

49:00.751 --> 49:02.751
It's a huia.

49:06.417 --> 49:08.247
I reckon that bird was a huia.

49:08.959 --> 49:10.169
Supposed to be extinct.

49:10.459 --> 49:12.129
That's pretty rare.

49:12.376 --> 49:17.376
Mate,... I reckon there'd be a lot of people
interested in seeing something like that.

49:17.459 --> 49:21.129
And the people who discovered
them would be... pretty famous.

49:21.130 --> 49:23.746
Yeah, probably some
money in it too.

49:23.751 --> 49:27.171
Mind you, need some
photos to prove it.

49:28.167 --> 49:30.037
We don't have a camera.

49:31.209 --> 49:33.079
When was the last
time you washed?

49:33.251 --> 49:34.881
About a month ago.

49:35.084 --> 49:37.004
Well, that's not enough, eh?

49:55.292 --> 49:56.832
OK, mate. Let's go.

50:03.001 --> 50:03.921
What have you got there mate?

50:03.959 --> 50:05.749
Huh? Oh books.

50:06.167 --> 50:09.747
Books? Bloody books.
Look for food and warm stuff.

50:10.001 --> 50:13.461
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keep your pants on.

50:16.834 --> 50:18.754
Jeez. That's a ranger.

50:19.709 --> 50:20.749
Oh, he's dead.

50:24.334 --> 50:25.334
Oh Jeez.

50:25.917 --> 50:27.627
You all right, mate?
What's the matter?

50:29.001 --> 50:30.711
Ricky, we've got
to do something.

50:30.959 --> 50:33.878
Are you going to manslaughter him?
Because I don't think I can watch.

50:33.879 --> 50:37.076
No, you idiot. I'm...
We've got to get him some help.

50:37.126 --> 50:39.786
There's a track down to a river; there's
some bush people that live down there.

50:39.792 --> 50:40.961
It's about a two-hour trek.

50:40.962 --> 50:42.459
We can make it before dark.

50:43.667 --> 50:46.147
Well, someone has got to stay
behind and look after this bloke.

50:47.667 --> 50:48.707
Have fun.

50:48.876 --> 50:51.996
Now don't go wandering
just stick to the tracks.

50:52.334 --> 50:55.750
If you get desperate,...
eat your dog.

50:55.751 --> 50:56.751
What?

50:57.084 --> 51:00.924
You'll be right, mate.
Just bloody well come back, OK?

51:00.959 --> 51:01.959
OK.

51:36.501 --> 51:38.671
What do you think you're
doing out here, freaky kid?

51:38.959 --> 51:40.749
There's a sick man
up at Carrington Hut

51:40.792 --> 51:44.002
He can't walk, and he's having trouble
breathing. Can you radio in a chopper?

51:44.042 --> 51:46.132
OK. Sweet as.

51:47.042 --> 51:52.752
'Uh, yeah, we need a helicopter
up here ASAP. Over.'

51:53.667 --> 51:55.627
Does it look like
I carry a radio?

51:55.667 --> 51:56.827
What's wrong with him?

51:56.834 --> 51:58.294
I don't know.
He might be dying.

51:58.334 --> 52:02.424
Ew. Oh, OK. Come on,
we'll go call the cop.

52:04.792 --> 52:07.922
Get on, man.

52:27.709 --> 52:31.749
I've already told you, Bruce up at Carrington
Hut. He's probably already dead by now.

52:31.792 --> 52:33.002
Do you want some ice cream?

52:33.042 --> 52:37.002
How should I know? Do your job,
fly up there and take a look.

52:37.084 --> 52:39.584
I already told you that,
but you're not listening.

52:39.626 --> 52:41.786
Oh, yes, I do. I can. Uh...

52:42.001 --> 52:43.250
You want a sausage? Yeah, yeah. Do that.

52:43.251 --> 52:46.921
Yeah, I'll tell him. Laters.

52:47.042 --> 52:49.143
They're gonna head up there
first thing in the morning.

52:49.167 --> 52:52.787
Better go, then. Got to get there before
they do so I can warn Uncle...

52:52.834 --> 52:55.754
Relax, bro. I know who you are.
I've seen your picture in the paper.

52:55.755 --> 52:58.381
Except you're skinnier
in real life.

52:58.792 --> 53:00.422
Where's your parents?

53:00.459 --> 53:01.459
Dead.

53:03.292 --> 53:06.502
Nah, jokes. My, um, dad, he's
watching the league with my uncle,

53:06.503 --> 53:08.750
and my mum, she's working at the lodge.

53:08.751 --> 53:10.081
Do you want to smoke a joint?

53:11.292 --> 53:14.961
Nah, I'm just being a dick. I don't smoke.
I'm talking heaps eh?

53:14.962 --> 53:19.169
Yeah, people say I talk too much. You
don't talk much, eh? I can talk for ages.

53:19.209 --> 53:22.129
If you want me to talk for ages,
or if you don't me to talk,

53:22.167 --> 53:23.747
just tell me if you
don't want me to talk.

53:23.751 --> 53:26.711
Like, this one time I was school,
and I was talking too much,

53:26.751 --> 53:27.921
and the teacher walks in...

53:31.667 --> 53:34.377
I'm not listening to her,
because she's my Auntie...

53:35.501 --> 53:43.501
♪ Only the crumbliest, flakiest
chocolate. Tastes like...

53:43.917 --> 53:45.157
But then I just kept talking...

53:46.709 --> 53:51.999
Hey, bub. Far out those bloody
Warriors are useless! Koretux.

53:52.251 --> 53:54.421
That's my dad.

53:54.459 --> 53:56.039
They are killing me.

53:57.209 --> 53:58.329
Hey.

54:00.126 --> 54:02.496
You're him. You're you!
That's him!

54:02.542 --> 54:06.582
Oh, Ricky Baker in my house.
You want, uh, anything?

54:06.584 --> 54:10.634
Sausage, bro? We've got heaps
of sausages, brother. Far...

54:10.792 --> 54:14.792
I hate to ask you this, Ricky,
but I'll kick myself if I don't.

54:14.834 --> 54:16.384
Um,...

54:17.876 --> 54:19.996
Can I have a selfie, please?

54:20.626 --> 54:24.326
Yeah? Yeah?
Far! oh my goodness.

54:24.334 --> 54:27.714
The boys are gonna be
buzzing on this one.

54:28.334 --> 54:30.254
Big smile. Big smile.

54:30.376 --> 54:32.456
Sad face. Sad face.

54:34.167 --> 54:36.077
Just take a quick selfie of us.

54:36.126 --> 54:37.727
It's not a selfie if
I take it, you idiot.

54:37.751 --> 54:41.421
Oh, come on. Just pretend
I'm the head to his body. CLICK!

54:41.459 --> 54:43.919
I captured Ricky Baker!

54:44.709 --> 54:47.499
Yeah, you captured me too.
You captured me.

54:47.542 --> 54:49.922
Oh no!

54:49.959 --> 54:54.249
Yeah. Chur, my bro. Chur.
Thank you, my bro.

54:54.251 --> 54:58.041
Been awesome meeting you, Ricky.
Just keep doing what you're doing, man.

54:58.084 --> 55:01.583
Keep striving. Stay Maori, bro.
We need a couple more Maoris like you.

55:01.584 --> 55:03.464
Oh, shut up. No, you shut up, eh.

55:03.465 --> 55:04.879
Yeah, get out.

55:04.917 --> 55:08.627
I'm imparting my knowledge on
the bro. You're the man for me.

55:08.667 --> 55:11.327
You're a boy, but you're a man.

55:12.126 --> 55:17.876
Bro. I love you,
Ricky.

55:24.626 --> 55:27.706
Why are you on the run?
Don't you want a normal life?

55:29.251 --> 55:30.631
Don't know. Maybe.

55:31.501 --> 55:33.671
You fullas could come live here.
They'll never find you.

55:33.672 --> 55:35.417
Nobody ever comes in here.

55:35.959 --> 55:37.629
I have to ask Uncle first.

55:37.751 --> 55:40.631
They say he's dangerous.
You guys get along?

55:40.667 --> 55:43.627
Yeah, we're like best friends.
We get on so well.

55:43.751 --> 55:46.129
He's, like, one of the best
bushmans in the whole country.

55:46.130 --> 55:48.126
He, like, teached me
all of his skills,

55:48.167 --> 55:51.377
so now we're, like,
equal best bushmen in the country.

55:51.378 --> 55:53.036
Yeah, we're best friends.

55:54.042 --> 55:55.882
Oh, where's your mum and dad?

55:55.917 --> 56:00.207
Don't know who my dad was, and my mum
got rid of me when I was little.

56:02.001 --> 56:05.251
Oh, you know where she is?
You ever met her?

56:06.251 --> 56:08.381
You know anything about her?

56:17.542 --> 56:21.962
Oh, pretty. She must've had
you when she was a teenager.

56:23.417 --> 56:25.207
You ever try and find her?

56:27.584 --> 56:30.504
Oh, you don't have to.
She should find you.

56:31.209 --> 56:33.959
What do you reckon you'd say
to her if you ever met her?

56:35.084 --> 56:37.924
Don't know. Never
really think about it.

56:38.959 --> 56:40.919
You want to hear a song I wrote?

56:42.167 --> 56:44.877
OK. Here goes.
It's an original.

56:52.167 --> 56:55.077
♪ Turn your lights down low.

56:55.292 --> 56:58.382
OK, I lied. It's
not an original.

56:58.417 --> 57:04.417
♪ And pull your window curtains.
♪ Your window curtains.

57:12.334 --> 57:17.334
♪ Into our life again...

57:18.751 --> 57:26.751
♪ Saying, 'Ooh, it's been
a long, long time...' ♪

57:34.084 --> 57:37.250
Morena, bro. Sausage?

57:37.251 --> 57:38.421
Yeah bro, you slept in.

57:38.459 --> 57:40.079
Oh no!

57:51.251 --> 57:54.251
Man, we gotta work
on your dismounts.

57:55.251 --> 57:56.631
You all good from here?

57:56.792 --> 57:58.502
Yeah.

57:59.167 --> 58:01.377
OK, Ricky bro, catch you up.

58:02.126 --> 58:03.456
Catch you up.

58:13.667 --> 58:15.127
Uncle!

58:15.167 --> 58:16.577
Tupac, come on!

58:22.251 --> 58:24.916
Oh no!

58:24.917 --> 58:26.247
Ninjas!

58:26.834 --> 58:28.884
Dire wolves!

58:30.292 --> 58:32.502
Child Welfare!

58:36.251 --> 58:40.381
Where did they go?
Where did they go?!

58:40.417 --> 58:42.747
I know you know something.

58:43.209 --> 58:46.999
Paula, he's the ranger. He had
diabetes. They saved his life.

58:47.042 --> 58:48.211
Oh, spare me, Andy.

58:48.212 --> 58:49.749
This is Gavin, our tech guy.

58:49.834 --> 58:53.214
Gav, Paula Hall, Child Welfare
Services. No child left behind.

58:53.251 --> 58:55.500
So, talk to me, Gav.
What's the situation?

58:55.501 --> 58:59.331
Uh, well, the hut is empty so they
must've left before we got here.

58:59.376 --> 59:01.416
Ooh, you worked that
out on your own, Gav?

59:02.334 --> 59:03.833
OK, what else?

59:03.834 --> 59:06.794
Well, uh, we've, ah, set up a rendezvous
spot here for the search party.

59:06.834 --> 59:09.964
And, uh, then we can
bring in, uh, Stingray.

59:10.001 --> 59:11.791
Stingray? Talk to me,
talk to me.

59:11.834 --> 59:16.424
Oh, well basically it's just a portable cell
phone tower that emits a false frequency.

59:16.459 --> 59:20.879
So any cell phone in a 5 K radius will latch
on, thinking it's an ordinary network.

59:20.917 --> 59:24.327
Frickin' A, brother.
That's some 'five eyes' shit right there.

59:24.376 --> 59:28.996
OK. Them clowns is
about to get Stingray-ed.

59:30.417 --> 59:35.077
Uncle, Uncle, Uncle.
Think, think, think, think.

59:35.501 --> 59:37.791
Oh! Tupac, find Zag.

59:39.376 --> 59:42.666
Oh, you're useless.
Oh! Think, Ricky, think.

59:42.709 --> 59:45.209
What would Uncle
do? What would Uncle do?

59:45.251 --> 59:49.211
Oh yes. Yes! Find water,
and then go to higher ground.

59:49.251 --> 59:50.581
And don't get naked.

01:00:02.001 --> 01:00:04.250
Ricky Baker and
Hector Faulkner...

01:00:04.251 --> 01:00:08.631
two renegade outlaws on
the run for four months now,

01:00:08.667 --> 01:00:11.787
and fast becoming
legends here in NZ.

01:00:12.584 --> 01:00:15.916
Faulkner and Baker's
popularity is on the rise

01:00:15.917 --> 01:00:20.537
after a valiant effort to save
a critically ill park ranger.

01:00:21.542 --> 01:00:26.252
The forces are circling against them,
and I am reminded of 'First Blood'.

01:00:26.542 --> 01:00:31.000
John Rambo, a man alone...
obviously they're two men alone...

01:00:31.001 --> 01:00:36.625
out there somewhere beyond the cutty
grass in this dense, thick bush.

01:00:36.626 --> 01:00:40.576
OK? Easy, efficient,
economic. All right, guys?

01:00:41.084 --> 01:00:43.044
Take us back a step.
What happened in...?

01:00:43.084 --> 01:00:45.924
Uh, I lost control and, uh,
I gave him the beating of his life.

01:00:45.959 --> 01:00:47.209
Yeah, you got him good.

01:00:47.251 --> 01:00:51.750
We're offering $10,000 to anyone who
can capture them, dead or alive.

01:00:51.751 --> 01:00:55.631
Oh,... alive.
They should be alive.

01:00:57.792 --> 01:01:02.332
They are fighting for freedom.
And we believe in freedom in NZ.

01:01:02.376 --> 01:01:04.536
It is a marvellous thing.

01:01:09.709 --> 01:01:13.249
Oi! Ricky! Freeze!

01:01:13.334 --> 01:01:17.004
OK, OK. OK, Ricky.
Stay there we're coming over to you.

01:01:17.417 --> 01:01:18.827
Come on.

01:01:18.876 --> 01:01:22.036
It's too steep. It's too steep.
Ricky, you come across here.

01:01:22.084 --> 01:01:22.834
No.

01:01:22.835 --> 01:01:26.254
Just slide down the bank, cross this
stream, and then climb up to us.

01:01:26.292 --> 01:01:27.922
- C'mon Ricky.
- You're absolutely safe.

01:01:27.959 --> 01:01:30.329
All you have to do is grab some
branches or some roots. OK?

01:01:30.376 --> 01:01:30.956
No!

01:01:31.001 --> 01:01:32.960
Ricky. Come over here right now!

01:01:32.961 --> 01:01:35.629
I'm not going back.
I'm not going to juvie.

01:01:35.667 --> 01:01:38.247
You are playing with a
bag of snakes, boy.

01:01:38.292 --> 01:01:40.582
A big bag with a lot
of holes in it.

01:01:40.584 --> 01:01:42.584
You've got the whole
country looking for you.

01:01:42.626 --> 01:01:43.876
I'll never stop running.

01:01:43.917 --> 01:01:47.247
Yeah, and I'll never stop chasing you.
I'm relentless. I'm like the Terminator.

01:01:47.251 --> 01:01:48.750
I'm more like
Terminator than you.

01:01:48.751 --> 01:01:50.791
I said it first. You're
more like Sarah Connor.

01:01:50.834 --> 01:01:51.504
No I'm not!

01:01:51.542 --> 01:01:55.502
Yes. And in the first movie too,
before she could do chin-ups.

01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:59.166
It doesn't have to be
this difficult, Ricky. Yeah?

01:01:59.167 --> 01:02:02.377
You're cold, you're damp...
and hungry.

01:02:03.834 --> 01:02:06.214
Look at that... scroggin.

01:02:06.334 --> 01:02:08.834
Got some nuts and dried fruit...

01:02:09.626 --> 01:02:12.826
Little pieces of chocolate.
Yum. Delicious.

01:02:12.959 --> 01:02:14.668
We could cut a deal;
make a trade.

01:02:14.669 --> 01:02:15.827
What kind of deal?

01:02:16.959 --> 01:02:18.629
The old man.

01:02:19.709 --> 01:02:22.329
You say that he made you do it,
let him take the rap,

01:02:22.376 --> 01:02:24.746
and I'll make sure you
never go back to juvie.

01:02:25.626 --> 01:02:29.246
We'll find you a new
foster home; a new Bella.

01:02:29.917 --> 01:02:32.077
- No deal.
- Oh, come on, Sarah Connor.

01:02:32.084 --> 01:02:33.291
Don't be a fool.

01:02:33.292 --> 01:02:35.382
You don't trade
family for anything.

01:02:35.417 --> 01:02:37.207
Well, you just keep running.

01:02:37.626 --> 01:02:40.576
He's here! He's here.
We got him!

01:02:40.626 --> 01:02:42.576
Go! Go! Go!

01:03:08.292 --> 01:03:12.882
OK. So you ate a sausage, she sang
a song, and you went to sleep.

01:03:14.042 --> 01:03:17.712
What? It was a relaxing song...
and a relaxing sausage.

01:03:20.417 --> 01:03:24.577
Do you think we've walked a thousand
miles yet? Like the wildebeest?

01:03:24.959 --> 01:03:26.039
Well, it feels like it, eh?

01:03:26.334 --> 01:03:31.254
Yeah. Always on the move,
always on the lookout for hunters,

01:03:31.501 --> 01:03:36.501
just like the wildebeest,
except humans.

01:03:36.876 --> 01:03:39.666
We're... Wilderpeople.

01:03:40.084 --> 01:03:41.424
Yeah, that's us.

01:03:41.459 --> 01:03:45.875
OK then, Wilderboy, let's
find somewhere to eat, shall we?

01:03:45.876 --> 01:03:46.996
There they are!

01:03:47.042 --> 01:03:48.832
Freeze!

01:03:49.751 --> 01:03:52.711
Shit just got real. Again.

01:03:53.001 --> 01:03:54.381
Now, drop your weapons.

01:03:54.667 --> 01:03:56.667
- We're not holding any weapons...
- Drop 'em!

01:03:58.001 --> 01:03:59.631
Go see what they got, Ricky.

01:04:04.084 --> 01:04:05.714
Baked beans,

01:04:06.084 --> 01:04:07.674
spaghetti,

01:04:08.084 --> 01:04:10.384
ba... baba... What?

01:04:10.417 --> 01:04:11.957
Oh, baba ganoush.

01:04:12.376 --> 01:04:13.126
What?

01:04:13.167 --> 01:04:14.537
Baba ganoush.

01:04:16.417 --> 01:04:17.037
What?

01:04:17.084 --> 01:04:18.884
Binoculars,

01:04:19.126 --> 01:04:21.916
rope, gaffer tape.

01:04:25.751 --> 01:04:27.331
Get their guns, Ricky.

01:04:27.751 --> 01:04:29.251
Give me your guns.

01:04:31.251 --> 01:04:32.711
Take the bolts out.

01:04:33.876 --> 01:04:35.996
There's a reward
for your capture.

01:04:36.584 --> 01:04:37.634
How much?

01:04:38.084 --> 01:04:39.084
10 grand.

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:41.422
Tell us when it gets to 20.

01:04:45.334 --> 01:04:49.134
And when they ask who did this,
tell them it was the Wilderpeople.

01:04:49.167 --> 01:04:50.627
The What-er-people?

01:04:52.334 --> 01:04:54.214
The Wilderpeople.

01:05:10.709 --> 01:05:14.709
No, I can't go back there. It wasn't my
farm; you know that. It was Bella's.

01:05:14.751 --> 01:05:18.831
She ran the show. I could do stuff... me
and the dog... but she was the farmer.

01:05:18.834 --> 01:05:20.214
And the cook.

01:05:20.251 --> 01:05:21.751
Yeah, a bloody good cook too.

01:05:22.959 --> 01:05:27.879
But you... you can't keep on the run forever.
You've got to go back to society, you know that.

01:05:28.209 --> 01:05:31.459
I'm a menace to society.
Anyway, if I ever went back,

01:05:31.501 --> 01:05:34.131
I'd probably end up driving
a steamroller or something.

01:05:34.167 --> 01:05:36.287
That's what happens
to gangsters.

01:05:36.334 --> 01:05:39.227
Well, there's nothing wrong with that,
but if you're better at something else,

01:05:39.251 --> 01:05:40.977
then you should probably
give that a go, shouldn't you?

01:05:41.001 --> 01:05:43.081
Yeah, but I'm better
at being a gangster.

01:05:43.126 --> 01:05:44.456
You're not a bloody gangster.

01:05:44.501 --> 01:05:45.501
How would you know?

01:05:45.542 --> 01:05:49.082
Because I've known real gangsters, and
they're a lot tougher than you are.

01:05:49.126 --> 01:05:51.166
Yeah, but were they
skux, though?

01:05:51.167 --> 01:05:53.207
Skux? What the
hell does that mean?

01:05:53.251 --> 01:05:55.711
You know,... skux.

01:05:55.959 --> 01:05:57.709
Yeah, but what does it mean?

01:05:57.751 --> 01:06:04.711
Everything. It's cool, spunky, brainy,
good-looking, you know, gangster.

01:06:04.751 --> 01:06:08.291
Oh, for God's sake.
You're not a bloody gangster!

01:06:10.126 --> 01:06:11.126
Oh, jeez.

01:06:11.876 --> 01:06:13.376
Zag! Tupac!
Get back, Zag!

01:06:13.417 --> 01:06:15.666
Get back!
Come back here, you...!

01:06:15.667 --> 01:06:17.997
Get in behind!
Get in behind, Zag!

01:06:18.042 --> 01:06:19.042
Zag!

01:06:23.959 --> 01:06:24.959
Zag!

01:06:25.667 --> 01:06:27.377
Get out of it, you mongrel!

01:06:30.834 --> 01:06:32.504
Shit.

01:06:49.834 --> 01:06:50.834
Uncle!

01:07:44.251 --> 01:07:47.291
What have you done?

01:07:54.751 --> 01:07:57.751
Oh jeez.

01:08:05.417 --> 01:08:07.497
Give us your gun, mate.
Hm?

01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:08.964
Go on, get out.
No, Uncle.

01:08:09.042 --> 01:08:10.502
Get out of...
Uncle! Get out of here,

01:08:10.542 --> 01:08:12.582
Ricky.
Go on, get out.

01:08:12.667 --> 01:08:14.457
But can't we just...?
Go!

01:08:41.959 --> 01:08:43.038
What does that say?

01:08:43.084 --> 01:08:44.174
Zag.

01:08:45.834 --> 01:08:47.294
Good.

01:10:09.167 --> 01:10:11.747
So, she's been with us
the whole time, eh?

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:13.542
Yeah.

01:10:13.959 --> 01:10:17.829
Well, pretty close
to the sky up here.

01:10:20.126 --> 01:10:22.456
Thanks for bringing her, mate.

Oh, it's hard to say.

01:12:30.667 --> 01:12:33.747
Those idiots are worse in
the bush than you are.

01:12:34.292 --> 01:12:37.082
Useless. Couldn't find
a clown in a circus.

01:12:37.126 --> 01:12:38.536
Stop!
This is the police!

01:12:38.584 --> 01:12:39.584
Oh shit!

01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:11.329
What?

01:13:23.209 --> 01:13:26.079
I was trying to tell you it
was like The Lord of the Rings.

01:13:52.417 --> 01:13:53.457
What the...?

01:13:55.584 --> 01:13:57.424
Can you see
that bush over there?

01:13:58.042 --> 01:13:59.422
Yeah.

01:14:03.501 --> 01:14:05.581
Is it a man or a bush?

01:14:07.501 --> 01:14:08.751
Bush!

01:14:10.251 --> 01:14:12.251
Man!

01:14:12.459 --> 01:14:16.289
Bushman!

01:14:17.959 --> 01:14:19.709
Ah!

01:14:20.501 --> 01:14:23.581
Hello. I was hoping
to run into you two.

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:27.076
Well, if you're after the reward, you
can bugger off. We're dangerous.

01:14:27.126 --> 01:14:28.826
Yeah, we're dangerous.

01:14:28.834 --> 01:14:32.333
Yeah, no. I heard about that.
Don't worry. I'm not going to capture you.

01:14:32.334 --> 01:14:34.714
You guys heard of
a... a local legend

01:14:34.751 --> 01:14:38.461
about a guy who lives out
here in the bush on this own?

01:14:38.584 --> 01:14:41.544
They call him Psycho Sam!

01:14:44.376 --> 01:14:45.376
No.

01:14:45.417 --> 01:14:48.207
No? Oh, OK.

01:14:49.001 --> 01:14:50.751
Well, my name is Sam, anyway.

01:14:51.501 --> 01:14:56.421
I'm a friend!
Come on.

01:15:10.334 --> 01:15:11.834
Bikkie?

01:15:20.751 --> 01:15:24.461
Why do you reckon
he calls himself Psycho Sam?

01:15:25.834 --> 01:15:29.544
Here you go. Put these on. Stop
the Government from tracking you.

01:15:30.167 --> 01:15:31.377
Never mind

01:15:31.417 --> 01:15:34.377
That fulla you saved... he was a ranger.
Diabetic.

01:15:34.417 --> 01:15:36.417
You got a little support over that.

01:15:36.459 --> 01:15:38.977
But then you robbed those hunters,
so you're back in the negatives again.

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:41.881
Well, that was... this fella.
He's the maniac.

01:15:41.917 --> 01:15:44.707
Well, they're still saying you're
dangerous. And a bit of a pervert.

01:15:44.751 --> 01:15:45.581
God damn it!

01:15:45.626 --> 01:15:49.626
It's all right. You can stay here as long as
you like. I've been up here 15 years now.

01:15:49.917 --> 01:15:51.167
Got everything I need.

01:15:51.501 --> 01:15:52.921
How long they been chasing ya?

01:15:52.959 --> 01:15:54.669
I don't know.
About five months now?

01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:55.669
Bastards!

01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:59.477
That's the typical government. Always trying to
step on the little guy just for living his life.

01:15:59.501 --> 01:16:00.751
It never stops either.

01:16:00.792 --> 01:16:02.422
That's why I can't go back.

01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:04.129
Not going to be part
of the machine.

01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:05.286
Form fillers.

01:16:05.501 --> 01:16:06.711
Form fillers?

01:16:07.834 --> 01:16:09.166
That's how they get you.

01:16:09.167 --> 01:16:11.537
Anything you want to do in life,
you got to fill out a form.

01:16:11.584 --> 01:16:13.084
And they've got forms
for everything.

01:16:13.126 --> 01:16:14.706
You fill it out,
it goes upstairs,

01:16:14.751 --> 01:16:16.209
and then they make you
fill out a new form,

01:16:16.210 --> 01:16:18.477
just to confirm it was you
that filled out the first form.

01:16:18.501 --> 01:16:20.041
And if ever you want to
stop filling out forms,

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:23.002
well, there's about five
different forms for that.

01:16:23.542 --> 01:16:26.502
Don't even get me started
on the national rugby team.

01:16:26.751 --> 01:16:28.631
They're not human.

01:16:43.626 --> 01:16:45.286
What you doing, mate?

01:16:46.667 --> 01:16:47.667
Writing.

01:16:48.334 --> 01:16:50.544
And what are you writing,
Mr Shakespeare?

01:16:52.209 --> 01:16:53.329
Haiku.

01:16:54.459 --> 01:16:56.829
Well, go on, read it out.
I'll tell you if it's any good.

01:16:57.501 --> 01:16:59.331
No, it's just a personal one.

01:16:59.626 --> 01:17:01.626
Oh, come on. Don't be shy.

01:17:02.209 --> 01:17:03.919
Mm, OK.

01:17:06.126 --> 01:17:09.786
Trees, birds, rivers, sky.

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:12.326
Running with my Uncle Hec.

01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:14.379
Living forever.

01:17:17.334 --> 01:17:19.424
See? Told you it was dumb.

01:17:21.501 --> 01:17:24.081
No, no.

01:17:24.126 --> 01:17:26.706
It was just that

01:17:26.959 --> 01:17:28.129
Well, that's the...

01:17:29.459 --> 01:17:33.329
That's the first time I've...
heard my name in a poem.

01:17:33.834 --> 01:17:34.834
I liked it.

01:17:38.876 --> 01:17:41.916
Gee, Bella would have loved
this adventure, wouldn't she?

01:17:42.084 --> 01:17:45.674
Mm. Why couldn't you
guys have any kids?

01:17:46.334 --> 01:17:49.134
Well, just couldn't.

01:17:49.167 --> 01:17:52.497
Well, I couldn't.

01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:56.541
That's not very fair. Some
people can't even have babies.

01:17:57.001 --> 01:18:00.421
And the ones who can...
they don't even want them.

01:18:02.209 --> 01:18:03.709
Like my mum.

01:18:04.334 --> 01:18:07.134
No, mate. She wanted you.
She was...

01:18:07.167 --> 01:18:10.707
she was probably just young. She couldn't
work out how to raise you, you know.

01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:12.539
I bet she loved you, though.

01:18:13.126 --> 01:18:14.126
Doubt it.

01:18:14.167 --> 01:18:16.327
Well, you never know.

01:18:16.376 --> 01:18:18.496
You're pretty likeable.

01:18:26.667 --> 01:18:28.247
Lights out, OK?

01:18:28.917 --> 01:18:29.957
Goodnight, Sam.

01:18:32.959 --> 01:18:35.289
Oh, I haven't got
that fixed yet.

01:18:35.334 --> 01:18:36.584
Goodnight, Uncle.

01:18:36.917 --> 01:18:38.417
Goodnight, mate.

01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:15.879
Uncle!

01:19:19.917 --> 01:19:26.497
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle, we have to go!

01:19:26.542 --> 01:19:29.750
Yeah. Even I can't stand
his cooking anymore.

01:19:29.751 --> 01:19:31.268
We'll get out off first
thing in the morning, eh?

01:19:31.292 --> 01:19:32.542
No! They're here.

01:19:32.584 --> 01:19:35.625
Government! Government!
Sorry, excuse me.

01:19:35.626 --> 01:19:36.376
Did they see you?

01:19:36.417 --> 01:19:37.747
No, but they're close!

01:19:37.792 --> 01:19:39.208
OK. Get our stuff!

01:19:39.209 --> 01:19:41.539
Hey! Hey, what happened
to my phone?

01:19:41.584 --> 01:19:43.794
I upgraded it for ya.
You're on four bars now.

01:19:43.834 --> 01:19:45.634
You clown. What have you done?

01:19:45.876 --> 01:19:47.435
Come out and give over
the boy, Mr Faulkner.

01:19:47.459 --> 01:19:48.999
Uncle! Uncle! They're close.

01:19:49.001 --> 01:19:52.381
Sam, what's the fastest
way out of here?

01:19:52.792 --> 01:19:54.882
- Jet pack!
- Do you actually have a jet pack?

01:19:54.917 --> 01:19:55.917
No. What?

01:19:56.376 --> 01:19:59.666
Wait! I've got an
underground bunker.

01:19:59.751 --> 01:20:02.711
This tunnel leads directly
to an underground chamb...

01:20:03.209 --> 01:20:04.418
I haven't dug it yet. Oh!

01:20:04.419 --> 01:20:06.667
What have I been
doing with my life?

01:20:06.834 --> 01:20:10.834
That's it. We've run out of options.
Just pretend to be dead. I'll be here.

01:20:12.626 --> 01:20:14.956
Come on, guys. It only
works if we all do it.

01:20:15.001 --> 01:20:17.631
For Christ's sake, Sam,
pull yourself together.

01:20:17.709 --> 01:20:20.539
We need to get out of here right now.
What are we gonna do?

01:20:21.834 --> 01:20:23.714
- Crumpy!
- What?

01:20:23.751 --> 01:20:24.751
Crumpy will take you!

01:20:24.792 --> 01:20:26.172
Who the hell is Crumpy?!

01:20:31.001 --> 01:20:31.791
Crumpy!

01:20:31.834 --> 01:20:33.458
Jesus, does she even go?

01:20:33.459 --> 01:20:36.459
Crumpy. Unkillable.
Four-wheel drive.

01:20:36.584 --> 01:20:38.634
Both wheels go...
go four-wheel-drive.

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:39.537
Ricky, where are ya?

01:20:39.584 --> 01:20:41.674
Oh, where did I put the keys?

01:20:43.626 --> 01:20:44.706
Unkillable!

01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:45.459
Get in!

01:20:45.501 --> 01:20:47.251
Ricky Baker, you are
not driving this ute.

01:20:47.292 --> 01:20:49.252
Get in the car!

01:20:50.042 --> 01:20:51.922
Oh shit.

01:20:53.376 --> 01:20:54.706
Tupac!

01:20:55.751 --> 01:20:58.791
OK. I'll hold up the government
and buy you some time.

01:20:58.834 --> 01:21:01.004
Thanks, mate.
Don't do anything stupid.

01:21:01.042 --> 01:21:04.252
Me?

01:21:06.751 --> 01:21:08.171
How did you get
this thing started?

01:21:08.209 --> 01:21:09.209
The knack.

01:21:14.626 --> 01:21:15.666
Crumpy!

01:21:25.001 --> 01:21:27.461
Hey! Sorry, mate. She's a
bit bumpy around here.

01:21:27.501 --> 01:21:29.711
Not too fast, Ricky. Slow down.

01:21:31.834 --> 01:21:34.794
No! No!

01:21:36.001 --> 01:21:37.041
Tree!

01:21:37.084 --> 01:21:38.044
Get off!

01:21:38.045 --> 01:21:41.002
Slow down!

01:21:46.667 --> 01:21:47.707
That's my bike.

01:21:47.751 --> 01:21:49.001
Shut up, they're mine.

01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:01.709
Whoa.

01:22:01.751 --> 01:22:03.381
Uh-oh.

01:22:04.042 --> 01:22:06.042
May as well play it to the end.
What do you reckon?

01:22:06.209 --> 01:22:10.919
You mean have a shoot out, and then when we've
got no bullets, run out and say, 'Freedom!'

01:22:10.959 --> 01:22:12.829
And then die in
a blaze of glory?

01:22:13.167 --> 01:22:15.917
No. I actually meant
till we run out of petrol.

01:22:16.084 --> 01:22:18.794
Oh. Well, I'm dying
in a blaze of glory.

01:22:18.834 --> 01:22:21.254
No!

01:22:28.959 --> 01:22:32.579
Oh.

01:23:29.459 --> 01:23:30.459
Whoa.

01:23:31.584 --> 01:23:36.674
Faulkner! This is the Police.
Stop the vehicle and hand over the boy.

01:23:36.751 --> 01:23:40.291
You're pretty much
surrounded. No escape.

01:23:41.042 --> 01:23:42.042
Come on mate.

01:23:42.834 --> 01:23:44.754
Mr Faulkner... Mr Faulk...

01:23:45.751 --> 01:23:48.461
Pull the bloody vehicle
over, Faulkner.

01:23:48.501 --> 01:23:49.711
Ricky Baker!

01:23:49.751 --> 01:23:54.919
You pull that ute over right now or you're
going to be in a whole lot of trouble, son!

01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:57.457
You don't even have
your full licence!

01:24:01.251 --> 01:24:02.631
Ricky!

01:24:08.251 --> 01:24:09.421
Is that what I think it is?

01:24:09.459 --> 01:24:14.419
Uncle Hec! Uncle Hec, that's the actual army.
This is like an actual war, like, for real!

01:25:07.834 --> 01:25:09.384
Roger, Comms, we have visual.

01:25:09.751 --> 01:25:14.631
Kilo, Foxtrot. We've
lost them in the bush.

01:25:18.251 --> 01:25:23.041
OK. Stop the truck, Ricky. I just...
stop the truck. I want to get out now.

01:25:23.042 --> 01:25:26.462
I didn't choose the skux life;
the skux life chose me.

01:25:26.501 --> 01:25:27.711
Ricky, stop.

01:25:27.751 --> 01:25:29.461
Stop!

01:25:29.501 --> 01:25:31.751
Freedom!

01:26:05.501 --> 01:26:07.291
How many bullets do we have?

01:26:07.417 --> 01:26:08.877
Ricky, we've got to stop.

01:26:08.917 --> 01:26:11.207
Never! Come on! Mate, this is it for me.

01:26:11.251 --> 01:26:16.211
Look... I can't go on anymore. My leg is
buggered. I can hardly see.

01:26:16.334 --> 01:26:17.424
This is the end.

01:26:30.876 --> 01:26:33.496
Ricky Baker, you get out
here this instant, son.

01:26:33.542 --> 01:26:36.332
You've caused a lot of damage
to private property today.

01:26:36.334 --> 01:26:38.674
You've taken out this
corrugated iron fence.

01:26:38.792 --> 01:26:41.042
Not cool, not cheap.

01:26:44.209 --> 01:26:47.499
Ricky, this isn't a game.
That's real over there.

01:26:47.542 --> 01:26:50.542
They're never gonna stop
chasing, ever. We're done.

01:26:50.584 --> 01:26:52.794
I'm not going back!

01:26:52.834 --> 01:26:55.384
Listen, it's over.

01:26:55.417 --> 01:26:56.417
Traitor!

01:26:57.751 --> 01:27:01.081
Give me your gun! Give me it!
Oi, you! Give me your gun.

01:27:01.126 --> 01:27:03.326
It's been booked.
It's in Wellington.

01:27:03.376 --> 01:27:04.956
Oh for God's sake!

01:27:05.126 --> 01:27:06.376
It wasn't me!

01:27:07.126 --> 01:27:09.956
You idiot, what did I tell
you about gun responsibility?

01:27:10.751 --> 01:27:12.581
That's it. I'm giving you up.

01:27:12.626 --> 01:27:14.206
We give up!

01:27:15.501 --> 01:27:17.131
We give up!

01:27:17.792 --> 01:27:20.125
He's molestering me!

01:27:20.126 --> 01:27:21.286
I knew it.

01:27:23.001 --> 01:27:24.500
You little bastard!

01:27:24.501 --> 01:27:26.211
He's a molesterer!

01:27:26.292 --> 01:27:30.792
I'm not! He's lying!
I'm not a molesterer!

01:27:31.667 --> 01:27:33.127
I bloody hate you.

01:27:33.167 --> 01:27:34.957
I hate you too, traitor!

01:27:35.042 --> 01:27:39.382
That's it. You're on your own.

01:27:39.751 --> 01:27:41.711
Don't shoot!

01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:55.167
Don't you take another step.

01:27:58.001 --> 01:27:59.421
What do you think you're doing?

01:27:59.459 --> 01:28:01.499
What do you think
he's doing, Andy?

01:28:02.959 --> 01:28:03.669
Andy?

01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:06.629
You're not going anywhere.
We stick together!

01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:08.499
What, are you gonna shoot me?

01:28:09.334 --> 01:28:11.541
Do it.

01:28:11.542 --> 01:28:13.172
We're family!

01:28:13.459 --> 01:28:15.209
Like hell.

01:28:15.542 --> 01:28:16.922
Go ahead. Shoot me.

01:28:16.959 --> 01:28:19.829
Got you now, perv.

01:28:22.209 --> 01:28:23.209
Oh!

01:28:23.251 --> 01:28:25.631
You shot me!
I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

01:28:25.667 --> 01:28:26.667
It was an accident!

01:28:30.376 --> 01:28:32.626
I've got him! I've
got the package!

01:28:33.209 --> 01:28:34.669
Well done, everybody!

01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:37.249
Now let's get this precious
child out of here!

01:28:37.251 --> 01:28:40.631
I'm sorry, Uncle. No!
I'm not your bloody uncle.

01:28:40.667 --> 01:28:43.916
I didn't mean to!
Hector Faulkner, you are under arrest.

01:28:43.917 --> 01:28:48.827
Whatever you do or say will be used
against you in a court of law!

01:28:48.876 --> 01:28:49.876
Paula!

01:28:50.876 --> 01:28:54.456
Police in NZ don't really say that.
That's like an American thing.

01:28:54.459 --> 01:28:55.829
And you're not a cop.

01:28:56.751 --> 01:28:57.881
It's over.

01:29:14.751 --> 01:29:16.881
Get in.

01:29:16.917 --> 01:29:19.207
Oh!

01:29:58.251 --> 01:30:03.500
Yeah, I found him on my horse,
and we had some sausages...

01:30:03.501 --> 01:30:06.419
Uh, I'm a big fan and, uh,
managed to scab me a selfie.

01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:09.827
I said that I was the Terminator and he was
in fact Sarah Connor.

01:30:09.876 --> 01:30:13.576
I said, 'I didn't choose the skux life,
uh, the skux life chose me.'

01:30:13.626 --> 01:30:16.496
Who is going to give him that
upbringing? Is it perhaps...?

01:30:16.542 --> 01:30:18.922
We just want what's best
for the child, Your Honour.

01:31:41.542 --> 01:31:43.500

Ca-caw, Hec!

01:32:13.167 --> 01:32:14.327
Hi.

01:32:19.709 --> 01:32:22.829
How was jail?
Did you shank anyone?

01:32:27.251 --> 01:32:28.251
I'm sorry.

01:32:29.334 --> 01:32:31.714
I'm sorry that I shot you,...

01:32:32.417 --> 01:32:34.457
and I'm sorry that
I burnt down your shed.

01:32:34.501 --> 01:32:35.041
That's enough.

01:32:35.084 --> 01:32:38.416
And I'm sorry for what I said that day,
about you being a molesterer.

01:32:38.417 --> 01:32:40.327
That really is enough;
I'm getting uncomfortable.

01:32:40.334 --> 01:32:44.544
I just got carried away being
an outlaw; had too much fun.

01:32:52.126 --> 01:32:53.416
Been doing all right?

01:32:53.667 --> 01:32:57.327
Yeah, I just had to stick it out
in a new family for a year.

01:32:57.334 --> 01:33:00.794
I did.
You'll like them.

01:33:02.042 --> 01:33:06.582
Man, you'd love it there. There's heaps
of room, they need some help on the farm,

01:33:06.667 --> 01:33:08.627
it's right next to the bush...

01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:11.709
Oh, and I also saved
up and got this.

01:33:12.417 --> 01:33:14.127
You want to find that bird?

01:33:14.167 --> 01:33:15.627
Yeah. We'll be famous.

01:33:15.876 --> 01:33:18.956
Nah, you're
better off without me, mate.

01:33:19.001 --> 01:33:20.581
Yeah. But I...

01:33:20.626 --> 01:33:23.036
I just thought that...

01:33:27.667 --> 01:33:29.207
OK.

01:33:30.084 --> 01:33:31.884
Sorry.

01:33:39.626 --> 01:33:41.956
Hey. Wait on.

01:33:44.501 --> 01:33:47.131
I've got something to say.

01:33:48.834 --> 01:33:51.964
Me and this fat kid...

01:33:53.001 --> 01:33:59.171
We ran, we ate, and read books.

01:33:59.417 --> 01:34:02.917
And it was the best.

01:34:09.251 --> 01:34:11.041
It was the best.

01:34:13.584 --> 01:34:15.384
Yeah.

01:34:15.876 --> 01:34:20.036
Look, to tell you the truth,

01:34:20.501 --> 01:34:23.331
I can't stand it here.
It's full of old people.

01:34:24.917 --> 01:34:27.707
So... you're coming?

01:34:29.709 --> 01:34:32.209
Yeah. Yeah, I'm coming.

01:34:32.959 --> 01:34:36.749
Wouldn't want a little twerp like you to
get all the credit for finding a bird.

01:34:37.751 --> 01:34:39.501
Yeah, but I've got one rule...

01:34:40.001 --> 01:34:41.751
you got to let
me call you 'Uncle'.

01:34:43.626 --> 01:34:44.876
Uncle?

01:34:47.292 --> 01:34:49.332
Yeah, I can stand that.

01:34:49.417 --> 01:34:51.127
I've got one rule too.

01:34:52.376 --> 01:34:54.496
Not allowed to shoot me.

01:35:06.334 --> 01:35:10.674
OK, I'll... I'll go
and get my toothbrush.

01:35:28.751 --> 01:35:31.211
Here we go. Reckon
you can handle it?

01:35:31.251 --> 01:35:33.001
What do you think?

01:35:34.167 --> 01:35:36.377
Reckon you can find that bird?

01:35:36.751 --> 01:35:39.001
Yeah. I think
I know where it is.

01:35:39.501 --> 01:35:42.631
Seem to remember it was a
pretty beautiful place, was it?

01:35:43.751 --> 01:35:46.881
Yeah. Majestical.

01:35:49.084 --> 01:35:51.134
Come on. Let's go.

01:35:56.542 --> 01:35:59.172
Get in my way, I'll have
your guts for garters.

01:35:59.209 --> 01:36:01.789
Well, I honestly don't know
what 'guts for garters' is, so...

01:36:02.751 --> 01:36:04.000
Well, it's gangster talk.

01:36:04.001 --> 01:36:06.501
Yeah. We didn't chose
the skux life...

01:36:06.542 --> 01:36:08.882
the skux life chose us.
