01:12.429 --> 01:14.532
All right...

01:16.500 --> 01:19.637
You're the Sprite, right?
Okay.

01:21.038 --> 01:22.874
Um... okay.

01:24.475 --> 01:28.010
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, cabin
crew, please remain seated.</i>

01:28.012 --> 01:30.712
Looks like we got a ways before
we break through this thing.

01:30.714 --> 01:33.051
We're gonna have some
rough air coming up.

01:34.985 --> 01:37.385
<i>We're gonna leave the seatbelt
signs on for the time being.</i>

01:37.387 --> 01:39.787
<i>So just sit back, relax.</i>

01:39.789 --> 01:41.989
<i>And we hope to see sunnier
skies here in a bit.</i>

01:41.991 --> 01:43.691
<i>Hope to punch through
the storm shortly.</i>

01:43.693 --> 01:45.361
<i>And again, please remain seated</i>

01:45.363 --> 01:48.195
<i>and keep those
seatbelts fastened.</i>

01:48.197 --> 01:50.900
Everyone, thank you so much
for your patience.

01:50.902 --> 01:54.572
We'll restart beverage service
once we reach clearer skies.

02:05.383 --> 02:07.015
Did you check the ATIS?

02:07.017 --> 02:08.850
I want to get a
read on the weather report.

02:08.852 --> 02:11.455
See when we might break
through this thing.

02:12.256 --> 02:14.491
(gasps)

02:16.360 --> 02:18.929
<i>In sports,
the international...</i>

02:30.841 --> 02:33.341
Why doesn't your
dad smile in photos?

02:33.343 --> 02:35.677
He never has.

02:35.679 --> 02:37.146
Yeah, but... but why?

02:37.148 --> 02:40.315
Oh, I don't know.
Just not his thing.

02:40.317 --> 02:43.452
Even in my baby photos,
he would just like hold me

02:43.454 --> 02:45.754
and just be like...

02:45.756 --> 02:47.189
Probably something I did.

02:47.191 --> 02:49.494
As a baby?

02:52.061 --> 02:55.029
Hey, Mom looks happy.

02:55.031 --> 02:57.464
Did they hate me?
They hated me.

02:57.466 --> 02:58.767
They did not hate you.

02:58.769 --> 03:00.469
That's just how they are.

03:00.471 --> 03:02.571
- You're just saying that.
- No, no.

03:02.573 --> 03:04.005
See, I love you.

03:04.007 --> 03:08.177
And because I love you,
they love you, too.

03:08.179 --> 03:11.412
And even if they hate your guts,
they're still 2,600 miles away.

03:11.414 --> 03:13.049
(chuckles)

03:16.454 --> 03:19.521
- Well, Raisinet loved me.
- Mm-hmm.

03:19.523 --> 03:20.922
I'm sorry.
It was fun.

03:20.924 --> 03:22.357
Yeah?

03:22.359 --> 03:25.027
Yeah, and this shit going
on in my brain doesn't matter.

03:25.029 --> 03:28.230
Thank you for asking me to come.
It was perfect.

03:28.232 --> 03:29.231
Yeah?

03:29.233 --> 03:30.465
And thank you for smiling.

03:30.467 --> 03:32.737
Yeah, my pleasure.

03:40.578 --> 03:41.576
Anything?

03:41.578 --> 03:42.810
No change.

03:42.812 --> 03:44.779
Looks like it's unavoidable.

03:44.781 --> 03:46.680
Projections are all
over the place.

03:46.682 --> 03:49.483
Precipitation patterns
are screaming MCC.

03:49.485 --> 03:51.352
But that can't be right.

03:51.354 --> 03:52.989
Great.

03:56.060 --> 03:58.696
It's like this thing
is following us.

04:12.476 --> 04:13.875
It's 25A.

04:13.877 --> 04:15.779
And it's your turn.

04:26.357 --> 04:28.956
Uh...

04:28.958 --> 04:31.092
Yes, sir?
What can I do for you?

04:31.094 --> 04:34.696
Can you please tell the pilot
to not crash the plane? Thanks.

04:34.698 --> 04:36.997
I assure you that
he's already considered that.

04:36.999 --> 04:38.999
Are you on the same
flight as me?

04:39.001 --> 04:42.004
I...
Can I get you something?

04:42.006 --> 04:45.172
My medicine?
It's in my bag.

04:45.174 --> 04:47.542
Sure.
Is it in your carry-on?

04:47.544 --> 04:48.776
Do you know which bin you...

04:48.778 --> 04:51.078
No, no.
My suitcase!

04:51.080 --> 04:54.081
Oh, sir, if you checked
your luggage at the airport,

04:54.083 --> 04:55.951
we can't get to it.
It's in cargo.

04:55.953 --> 04:59.021
No, no, no, no.
Don't you have access to that?

04:59.023 --> 05:01.189
I mean, what
if it's an emergency?

05:01.191 --> 05:03.025
Sir, I'm sorry.

05:03.027 --> 05:06.593
I can get you a headset
or pillow, blanket.

05:06.595 --> 05:08.062
I can get you some water.

05:08.064 --> 05:09.631
How can I
relax knowing that

05:09.633 --> 05:13.003
we could crash any minute now?

05:21.044 --> 05:22.477
Hey...

05:22.479 --> 05:25.679
Oh!
What a little heartbreaker!

05:25.681 --> 05:27.814
- How old is she?
- Almost four.

05:27.816 --> 05:30.151
Oh, what a great age.

05:30.153 --> 05:34.388
I wish I could see the look
on her face when she sees you.

05:34.390 --> 05:36.958
I'd be happy to see
any look on her face.

05:36.960 --> 05:39.561
I've been overseas deployed
for 24 months now.

05:39.563 --> 05:41.896
The only thing I could think
about was her and her mom.

05:41.898 --> 05:44.465
Are you a soldier?

05:44.467 --> 05:45.968
Yes, ma'am.
Army Ranger.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.502
So how much more time
do you have left?

05:48.504 --> 05:51.706
Well, I was delayed in Paris.
The only flight out was to LAX.

05:51.708 --> 05:53.508
So we got five hours
to New York.

05:53.510 --> 05:57.612
And then an hour car ride.
And I get to see my family.

05:57.614 --> 05:58.946
You're adorable.

05:58.948 --> 06:00.148
(laughs)

06:00.150 --> 06:02.820
- She's adorable.
- Oh, I'll say.

06:05.054 --> 06:06.888
They're getting restless.

06:06.890 --> 06:08.790
Yeah. Well, hopefully,
we break through this

06:08.792 --> 06:10.158
before they get
"restless" restless.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.960
Well, we're about
to start service.

06:11.962 --> 06:13.494
So does anyone need
anything now, though?

06:13.496 --> 06:16.163
Oh, yeah. Can you pass me one
of the blankets, please?

06:16.165 --> 06:18.499
Yes. Here you go.

06:18.501 --> 06:19.802
You're too nice for this crew.

06:19.804 --> 06:22.607
Thank you, Liam.

06:35.652 --> 06:36.887
Wow.

06:50.366 --> 06:51.833
Hey.

06:51.835 --> 06:54.772
Don't worry.
I'm supposed to have it.

06:55.705 --> 06:58.309
Sorry.
I wasn't worried.

07:00.710 --> 07:03.381
I'm lying.
I was worried.

07:10.520 --> 07:12.222
Name's Thaddeus.

07:13.823 --> 07:15.660
U.S. Air Marshal.

07:16.693 --> 07:19.664
Anna.
Nice to meet you.

07:20.730 --> 07:22.399
Likewise.

07:32.775 --> 07:34.141
Flight Deck?

07:34.143 --> 07:36.511
Can I get you
guys anything?

07:36.513 --> 07:39.848
No, I think we're good.
Thanks, Alice.

07:39.850 --> 07:40.848
Everything good back there?

07:40.850 --> 07:42.550
<i>Mostly.</i>

07:42.552 --> 07:46.989
We had one passenger ask that
you guys not crash the plane.

07:46.991 --> 07:48.622
Hadn't thought of that.

07:48.624 --> 07:50.391
<i>All right.</i>

07:50.393 --> 07:52.593
<i>Well, let me know if you guys
need something. Just ring.</i>

07:52.595 --> 07:54.064
We will. Thanks.

07:57.734 --> 07:59.167
Everything all
right back there?

07:59.169 --> 08:01.537
Yeah, yeah.
Seems good.

08:01.539 --> 08:03.874
Alice was just checking in.

08:06.242 --> 08:07.943
It would have been nice if
JFK had given us

08:07.945 --> 08:10.811
a heads up on this storm
before takeoff.

08:10.813 --> 08:12.646
Oh, I don't think
they knew about it.

08:12.648 --> 08:15.917
I never seen a storm this
big creep up out of nowhere.

08:15.919 --> 08:17.419
We should have been able
to eyeball this thing

08:17.421 --> 08:19.223
the moment we were
off the ground.

08:20.590 --> 08:23.824
Yeah, these domestic
red-eyes are a nightmare, too.

08:23.826 --> 08:25.693
I've done my fair share.

08:25.695 --> 08:29.198
But after a while, I start,
you know, needing some daylight.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.033
Any tips?

08:32.034 --> 08:34.469
All the coffee
in the world, my friend.

08:34.471 --> 08:37.307
All the coffee in the world.

08:40.476 --> 08:42.010
Any plans for New York?

08:42.011 --> 08:45.880
Absolutely.
Got a hot date.

08:45.882 --> 08:47.181
(chuckles)

08:47.183 --> 08:48.882
The most beautiful woman
you've ever seen.

08:48.884 --> 08:50.785
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

08:50.787 --> 08:53.755
What's her name?

08:53.757 --> 08:54.923
Don't know yet.

08:54.925 --> 08:57.328
(chuckles)

09:05.902 --> 09:07.569
Blanket make things better?

09:07.571 --> 09:08.969
Maybe.

09:08.971 --> 09:10.804
I don't get people
who are afraid of flying.

09:10.806 --> 09:12.006
Like if you can't do it,
why try?

09:12.008 --> 09:13.641
I don't think it's the flying.

09:13.643 --> 09:15.544
I think it's being stuck in
a compressed metal tube

09:15.546 --> 09:16.978
that resembles a penis
while thinking

09:16.980 --> 09:18.545
about falling and exploding.

09:18.547 --> 09:21.116
That's not an image
I want to think of.

09:21.118 --> 09:22.817
What?
A giant penis?

09:22.819 --> 09:24.652
Or the falling and exploding?

09:24.654 --> 09:27.088
Both.

09:27.090 --> 09:29.323
Were you ever
afraid of planes?

09:29.325 --> 09:31.959
I'm afraid of a lot of things.

09:31.961 --> 09:33.562
But flying isn't one of them.

09:33.564 --> 09:38.866
Being up here, it's a
beautiful thing we do.

09:38.868 --> 09:40.367
And look at us.

09:40.369 --> 09:42.337
Up here in the darkness
where no one can see us.

09:42.339 --> 09:44.973
Still majestic birds
after all this time.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.841
(chuckles)

09:46.843 --> 09:47.976
How long has it been?

09:47.978 --> 09:48.843
Like three years, girl.

09:48.845 --> 09:51.213
(laughs)

09:51.215 --> 09:53.381
(beeping)

09:53.383 --> 09:54.915
Please? I'm busy.

09:54.917 --> 09:56.351
You're shameless.

09:56.353 --> 09:58.120
- I'll get the next one.
- Oh my God.

09:58.122 --> 10:00.124
It's just...

10:38.995 --> 10:41.497
(screams)

10:44.634 --> 10:46.200
(screams)

10:46.202 --> 10:47.503
Ah!

10:50.473 --> 10:52.073
- What happened?
- No, no, there's something...

10:52.075 --> 10:53.540
- I saw...
- What?

10:53.542 --> 10:55.008
- On the wing!
- Sir, please take your seat...

10:55.010 --> 10:56.377
There's something out there!

10:56.379 --> 10:57.978
- Sir, calm down.
- Easy, man.

10:57.980 --> 11:00.015
You need to take a breath!

11:00.017 --> 11:00.948
I saw something!

11:00.950 --> 11:02.549
Calm down, please.

11:02.551 --> 11:04.555
Sir, the storm has
everyone shaken up.

11:06.090 --> 11:09.656
Sir, please, please,
please take your seat, okay?

11:09.658 --> 11:11.660
- Calm down.
- Come on. I can assure you

11:11.662 --> 11:13.461
that there's nothing like
that out there, okay?

11:13.463 --> 11:15.096
Take your seat.
You need to calm down.

11:15.098 --> 11:18.135
Okay, okay.
I just need... excuse me.

11:24.574 --> 11:26.407
Oh, sir, I'm sorry.
You can't use the bathroom.

11:26.409 --> 11:28.008
The captain hasn't turned
off the seatbelt sign.

11:28.010 --> 11:29.946
Sir, don't close the door!

11:33.383 --> 11:34.683
You okay?

11:34.685 --> 11:36.020
(beeping)

11:37.854 --> 11:40.954
Everything's fine, everyone.
Everything's fine.

11:40.956 --> 11:44.825
Excuse me?
What's happening?

11:44.827 --> 11:46.593
It's just nerves.
It happens.

11:46.595 --> 11:48.997
The storm has
everyone shaken up.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.131
Literally, I take
this flight all the time.

11:51.133 --> 11:52.400
This is the worst I've seen it.

11:52.402 --> 11:54.368
Do you live in Los Angeles?

11:54.370 --> 11:57.472
No, my parents do.
We were just there on vacation.

11:57.474 --> 11:59.407
We're heading back
to New York... Brooklyn.

11:59.409 --> 12:02.043
Actually, it was a
late honeymoon, really.

12:02.045 --> 12:03.745
Oh, well, congratulations.

12:03.747 --> 12:04.679
Thanks.

12:04.681 --> 12:06.146
Let me ask you something.

12:06.148 --> 12:07.714
So what happens
when a passenger's

12:07.716 --> 12:10.053
more out of control,
like more than that?

12:12.355 --> 12:13.655
Um...

12:13.657 --> 12:15.823
Generally, these situations
resolve themselves.

12:15.825 --> 12:20.093
But we have protocols in place
for extreme situations.

12:20.095 --> 12:22.497
Yeah, man.
That's scary.

12:22.499 --> 12:26.067
As I said, these situations
usually resolve themselves.

12:26.069 --> 12:28.138
Nothing to fear.

12:31.273 --> 12:34.074
Oh, it's just the storm!
It's just the storm!

12:34.076 --> 12:35.410
You're seeing things!

12:35.412 --> 12:38.715
It's just the rain!
The turbulence.

12:42.018 --> 12:44.084
(ghost screams)

12:44.086 --> 12:46.456
(man screaming)

12:55.264 --> 12:58.132
Sir! Sir!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

12:58.134 --> 12:59.367
- Sir!
- Let me out!

12:59.369 --> 13:01.102
Let me off this plane!

13:01.104 --> 13:02.703
I can't be on this plane!

13:02.705 --> 13:04.305
Sir, please calm down!

13:04.307 --> 13:07.375
I can't be on this plane!
Get me off this plane!

13:07.377 --> 13:08.708
She tried to grab me.

13:08.710 --> 13:10.045
Who tried to grab you?

13:10.047 --> 13:11.478
A woman!
A woman in the mirror!

13:11.480 --> 13:12.881
- A woman in the mirror!
- Excuse me!

13:12.883 --> 13:14.314
(screams)

13:14.316 --> 13:15.516
- Get down! Get down!
- Liam, call the captain!

13:15.518 --> 13:16.916
Need any help?

13:16.918 --> 13:18.719
No! I'm an Air Marshal.
Everything's fine!

13:18.721 --> 13:20.121
Back in your seat!

13:20.123 --> 13:21.488
Everyone back in
your seat, please!

13:21.490 --> 13:23.190
- What happened?
- I don't know.

13:23.192 --> 13:24.791
I think he's having
a panic attack.

13:24.793 --> 13:26.495
I'm not having a panic attack!
I saw something!

13:26.497 --> 13:27.828
Stop!

13:27.830 --> 13:30.665
No, no, I saw something
in the mirror!

13:30.667 --> 13:32.467
Okay, I'm going to have
to restrain this passenger

13:32.469 --> 13:34.135
'til we get to JFK.

13:34.137 --> 13:35.368
Do you have anything
to calm him down?

13:35.370 --> 13:36.904
Yes, but we've never given...

13:36.906 --> 13:38.973
Whatever it is, grab it now!
Grab it now, grab it now!

13:38.975 --> 13:40.274
Hey, are you sure you
guys don't need any help?

13:40.276 --> 13:41.876
Everything's fine, okay?

13:41.878 --> 13:43.511
I'm a U.S. Air Marshal.
Back in your seat!

13:43.513 --> 13:46.282
Everyone back in your seats!

13:53.056 --> 13:54.789
Oh my God, he's a terrorist!

13:54.791 --> 13:57.092
No! I'm just dealing with
somebody who's a little detached

13:57.094 --> 13:59.430
from reality right now.

14:01.031 --> 14:03.100
Miss!

14:04.334 --> 14:07.237
I really need you to hurry!

14:11.740 --> 14:13.208
I can hear you people!

14:13.210 --> 14:15.742
I'm not a terrorist!

14:15.744 --> 14:17.279
How am I a terrorist?

14:17.281 --> 14:19.550
I'm not making this up!

14:23.219 --> 14:24.352
You have to believe...

14:24.354 --> 14:27.387
Here we go.
Swallow! Swallow!

14:27.389 --> 14:28.923
Swallow, that's what we
right there, okay?

14:28.925 --> 14:30.491
Swallow it.
Swallow it.

14:30.493 --> 14:32.327
That's what we want.
Right there, okay?

14:32.329 --> 14:35.563
We're okay.
Now we're good.

14:35.565 --> 14:39.366
Now we're calm.
Now we're calm.

14:39.368 --> 14:40.968
Are you tying him up?

14:40.970 --> 14:43.304
Got to keep him under control.

14:43.306 --> 14:44.939
We still have a lot of
time left on this plane.

14:44.941 --> 14:46.875
I don't want him waking up
and freaking out, okay?

14:46.877 --> 14:50.645
Okay.

14:50.647 --> 14:52.246
- We can get him up right now.
- Okay.

14:52.248 --> 14:53.481
Come on.
Come on, come on.

14:53.483 --> 14:56.784
Okay, everybody
in first class,

14:56.786 --> 14:58.586
I need you to get up.

14:58.588 --> 15:00.255
And move to the back of
the plane right now, please!

15:00.257 --> 15:02.390
- Everyone out. Come on.
- So sorry.

15:02.392 --> 15:03.524
Sir, this way.

15:03.526 --> 15:06.394
Ma'am.
Ladies, you too.

15:06.396 --> 15:07.628
Thank you so much.

15:07.630 --> 15:09.197
Okay, go ahead, sweetheart.

15:09.199 --> 15:11.165
Thank you so much.

15:11.167 --> 15:14.001
I am so sorry...

15:14.003 --> 15:15.770
The passenger that
was giving us the issue

15:15.772 --> 15:18.372
has been restrained.
He's been medicated.

15:18.374 --> 15:20.141
Thank you so much
for your patience with us.

15:20.143 --> 15:23.211
I think that the flight
should return to normal now.

15:23.213 --> 15:26.150
Again, I'm so sorry.

15:27.183 --> 15:28.717
You okay?

15:28.719 --> 15:30.184
That's what we want right there.

15:30.186 --> 15:32.523
Everything's okay!

15:37.659 --> 15:39.295
All right.

16:00.550 --> 16:03.285
You can't interfere
in stuff like this, Bran.

16:03.287 --> 16:04.919
What?

16:04.921 --> 16:06.386
I just wanted to help.

16:06.388 --> 16:07.588
Yeah, I know,
but this isn't something

16:07.590 --> 16:09.457
you should be involved in.

16:09.459 --> 16:11.358
Okay. I'm sorry.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.828
I guess I'm still in my head
about my parents.

16:13.830 --> 16:15.462
I don't know what
their problem is.

16:15.464 --> 16:17.431
You said it was okay.

16:17.433 --> 16:20.300
I believe you.

16:20.302 --> 16:21.401
I always believe you.

16:21.403 --> 16:24.338
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:24.340 --> 16:27.342
Maybe next time,
it'll be better.

16:27.344 --> 16:29.680
Yeah. I hope so.

16:39.321 --> 16:41.756
This storm is huge.

16:41.758 --> 16:44.925
It's blanketing everything.

16:44.927 --> 16:48.231
Five minutes ago, it looked like
we'd be out of it in 20, but...

16:50.800 --> 16:54.271
At least the altimeter
and fuel gauge are working.

16:55.537 --> 16:57.975
(radio chatter)

16:59.042 --> 17:00.308
Lightning screwing with us?

17:00.310 --> 17:02.142
Yeah, looks like it.

17:02.144 --> 17:06.550
But it shouldn't be
doing all this at once.

17:15.358 --> 17:16.424
Flight Deck.

17:16.425 --> 17:18.026
<i>Captain, it's Liam.</i>

17:18.028 --> 17:19.992
The storm caused a
passenger to freak out.

17:19.994 --> 17:21.662
The marshal stepped in
and assisted

17:21.664 --> 17:24.396
but we had to sedate
and restrain him.

17:24.398 --> 17:25.964
Restrain him?

17:25.967 --> 17:27.936
Is everything under
control back there?

17:29.473 --> 17:31.473
I think so.

17:31.475 --> 17:33.407
Okay, good.

17:33.409 --> 17:35.976
Just make sure
everybody's comfortable.

17:35.978 --> 17:38.279
The storm is the only thing
I wanna worry about right now.

17:38.281 --> 17:39.549
<i>Got it.</i>

18:03.438 --> 18:05.908
Okay. Here you are, ma'am.

18:19.589 --> 18:21.455
Sir, what can I get you?

18:21.457 --> 18:25.460
- Just a water, please.
- Okay.

18:25.462 --> 18:27.127
Miss?

18:27.129 --> 18:30.196
I was wondering if you had
anything else I could snack on.

18:30.198 --> 18:35.368
I had the peanuts and
this gentleman gave me his.

18:35.370 --> 18:37.805
But my stomach is
still rumbling.

18:37.807 --> 18:39.906
Oh, we're gonna start
the in-flight meals

18:39.908 --> 18:41.709
as soon as the storm dies down.

18:41.711 --> 18:45.011
Oh, okay, but is there
anything you can do?

18:45.013 --> 18:47.882
If I get you one
of the prepackaged salads,

18:47.884 --> 18:49.917
- would that help?
- Great.

18:49.919 --> 18:51.152
Okay. All right.

18:51.154 --> 18:52.923
(chuckles)

19:00.163 --> 19:01.396
Shh.

19:01.398 --> 19:04.632
Here you go.

19:04.634 --> 19:06.800
Thank you, sir,
for sharing your peanuts.

19:06.802 --> 19:08.638
Of course.

19:16.445 --> 19:17.912
You think he saw a ghost?

19:17.914 --> 19:19.312
No.

19:19.314 --> 19:24.452
I mean, I think he probably
thought he saw one, but come on.

19:24.454 --> 19:29.290
Yeah.
Probably just crazy.

19:29.292 --> 19:32.926
You know, I think I saw
a ghost when I was little.

19:32.928 --> 19:34.662
Really?

19:34.664 --> 19:37.264
I mean, maybe.

19:37.266 --> 19:39.934
You know, you see things
you don't understand

19:39.936 --> 19:42.235
like walking down
an old hallway

19:42.237 --> 19:44.972
and you see someone out of
the corner of your eye.

19:44.974 --> 19:47.876
But you look
and they're gone.

19:47.878 --> 19:51.779
Or you're driving and
there's someone behind you.

19:51.781 --> 19:56.017
You look for them and
then they're just gone.

19:56.019 --> 19:58.551
Is that ghosts
or just other people?

19:58.553 --> 20:01.923
Okay, like this one time,

20:01.925 --> 20:06.594
I remember being in
my bed at night.

20:06.596 --> 20:09.963
Lying on my side,
looking out my window

20:09.965 --> 20:12.433
at this line of trees
that's behind my house

20:12.435 --> 20:15.435
and I was blinking a lot 'cause
I'm trying to go to sleep.

20:15.437 --> 20:20.241
And there's this guy
that walks out of the woods.

20:20.243 --> 20:23.810
A guy?

20:23.812 --> 20:26.646
He looked like Frankenstein.

20:26.648 --> 20:28.782
But that's probably not right.

20:28.784 --> 20:30.216
(laughs)

20:30.218 --> 20:33.654
He started walking towards
the house through the backyard

20:33.656 --> 20:36.558
straight towards my window

20:36.560 --> 20:39.126
until I could see
the whites of his eyes

20:39.128 --> 20:43.196
and then he just stood
there and looked at me.

20:43.198 --> 20:45.332
No shit.
What did you do?

20:45.334 --> 20:48.402
I freaked out.
I ran to my parents' room.

20:48.404 --> 20:51.071
Woke them up, told them
I saw a guy in my window.

20:51.073 --> 20:55.609
And then my dad, he came
in and looked around,

20:55.611 --> 20:59.446
but there was nobody there.

20:59.448 --> 21:01.250
They even went into
the backyard.

21:02.784 --> 21:04.719
They said I was dreaming.

21:04.721 --> 21:07.157
Were you dreaming, though?
You think?

21:11.026 --> 21:15.030
I don't remember falling
asleep or waking up.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.098
I mean, I don't...

21:19.100 --> 21:21.269
I don't think
you saw a ghost, babe.

21:21.271 --> 21:23.570
I think you saw creeps.

21:23.572 --> 21:25.639
I don't know.

21:25.641 --> 21:28.744
Have you ever seen one?

21:31.546 --> 21:32.848
No.

21:34.183 --> 21:35.749
But I have seen an angel.

21:35.751 --> 21:37.385
Okay, you know that's
not gonna get you

21:37.387 --> 21:39.886
out of my happy wedding
conversation, right?

21:39.888 --> 21:41.555
All right, worth a
try, worth a try.

21:41.557 --> 21:43.290
I know.

21:43.292 --> 21:45.529
- Cool it.
- All right.

22:06.315 --> 22:08.215
You know, if you give
someone a salad during a storm,

22:08.217 --> 22:09.683
we'll be picking
crouton crumblies

22:09.685 --> 22:11.085
off the floor for hours.

22:11.087 --> 22:13.754
I know, but she was very cute.

22:13.756 --> 22:15.489
This has been a flight, huh?

22:15.491 --> 22:16.957
I know.

22:16.959 --> 22:19.193
I hope that's the worst
that will happen.

22:19.195 --> 22:20.961
Well, we've got
Charles Bronson

22:20.963 --> 22:23.233
over there keeping watch.
We should be fine.

22:25.702 --> 22:27.568
(gagging)

22:27.570 --> 22:29.002
You okay?

22:29.004 --> 22:31.041
(retching)

22:32.609 --> 22:33.706
Okay, all right...

22:33.708 --> 22:35.878
(vomiting)

22:37.679 --> 22:39.646
Need some help over here!

22:39.648 --> 22:40.947
Oh, my God!

22:40.949 --> 22:42.883
Ma'am, are you all right?

22:42.885 --> 22:45.219
- You bring a towel!
- Yeah.

22:45.221 --> 22:46.587
Napkins! Anything!

22:46.589 --> 22:47.655
Okay.

22:47.657 --> 22:49.022
Can you breathe?
All right.

22:49.024 --> 22:50.424
She's coming back.
All right.

22:50.426 --> 22:52.928
The hits just keep coming.

22:53.796 --> 22:55.963
Here you go.

22:55.965 --> 22:57.464
Let's get you back in the seat.

22:57.466 --> 23:00.070
There you go.
Get up.

23:03.773 --> 23:05.138
Easy, easy.

23:05.140 --> 23:06.706
(coughing)

23:06.708 --> 23:09.012
I think it's in my hair.

23:11.781 --> 23:14.084
Check the other salads! Go!

23:25.427 --> 23:27.263
Jesus!

23:58.160 --> 23:59.828
(intercom beeps)

24:00.830 --> 24:02.229
Flight Deck.

24:02.231 --> 24:04.298
<i>Hey, sorry to bother
you again...</i>

24:04.300 --> 24:06.901
<i>Pan US57. Be advised,
you're rapidly approaching</i>

24:06.903 --> 24:08.501
<i>a low-pressure system.</i>

24:08.503 --> 24:11.907
<i>It will be difficult to
continue tracing you at...</i>

24:12.841 --> 24:15.142
This is PAN US57, over.

24:15.144 --> 24:17.877
We're losing you.
PAN US57, over.

24:17.879 --> 24:20.780
<i>Pan... 57... Repeat.</i>

24:20.782 --> 24:22.450
<i>Advised... rapidly low
pressure...</i>

24:22.452 --> 24:24.087
<i>system, will be difficult
...to track you.</i>

24:27.189 --> 24:29.123
Liam, what's going on?

24:29.125 --> 24:33.897
Our in-flight meals are,
well, they're rotten, I think.

24:34.730 --> 24:36.229
Rotten?

24:36.231 --> 24:38.165
<i>They're like Satanic rotten.</i>

24:38.167 --> 24:42.038
Full of maggots,
actual maggots.

24:43.839 --> 24:46.040
That is disgusting.

24:46.042 --> 24:48.144
The in-flight meals
are rotten.

24:50.146 --> 24:51.546
Great.

24:51.548 --> 24:55.452
Have Liam call LAX.
Tell them about the food.

24:56.918 --> 24:58.918
Captain says to call LAX.

24:58.920 --> 25:00.386
<i>Let them know about the food.</i>

25:00.388 --> 25:02.322
<i>There's not much
we can do from up here.</i>

25:02.324 --> 25:03.857
So just try and
keep the passengers

25:03.859 --> 25:05.425
as comfortable as you can,

25:05.427 --> 25:08.231
and worst case, we'll take
care of them we land.

25:10.699 --> 25:12.265
What did he say?

25:12.267 --> 25:14.403
You keep
everyone comfortable.

25:16.805 --> 25:18.606
The phone's not working.

25:18.608 --> 25:21.274
We're running out of ways
to keep them comfortable.

25:21.276 --> 25:23.144
Seriously, bring
on the frogs!

25:23.146 --> 25:24.478
What?

25:24.480 --> 25:26.614
What else was there?
Locusts? Darkness?

25:26.616 --> 25:28.950
Yeah.
Bring on the...

25:28.952 --> 25:31.821
(screaming)

25:33.955 --> 25:36.325
Ryan, go for shoulder straps!

25:38.695 --> 25:40.463
(screaming)

25:44.800 --> 25:46.367
No power to the engines?

25:46.369 --> 25:48.135
That's gotta be
a technical bug!

25:48.137 --> 25:49.973
No way we got struck!

25:51.974 --> 25:53.973
No thrust!

25:53.975 --> 25:56.409
Altimeter's out!

25:56.411 --> 25:58.377
All right, we have to keep
the nose up in this glide!

25:58.379 --> 25:59.713
You got eyes on
the horizon, Ryan?

25:59.715 --> 26:01.214
I'm trying.

26:01.216 --> 26:02.849
I can't tell if it's up
or down right now.

26:02.851 --> 26:04.085
All right,
keep your eyes out there.

26:04.087 --> 26:06.354
Wait for a lightning strike!

26:06.356 --> 26:08.157
(screaming)

26:17.966 --> 26:19.165
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

26:19.167 --> 26:22.703
JFK center, this is
Pan US 57!

26:22.705 --> 26:23.904
We've got dual engine failure!

26:23.906 --> 26:25.505
I repeat, all engines out!

26:25.507 --> 26:27.607
Going for an engine failure
systems check!

26:27.609 --> 26:30.610
- Ryan! Anything?
- No...

26:30.612 --> 26:31.677
Come on!

26:31.679 --> 26:33.012
We're in aerodynamic stall!

26:33.014 --> 26:34.481
We are dead stick!

26:34.483 --> 26:35.949
We've got to get
the APU fired up

26:35.951 --> 26:37.987
or we are up a shit's creek!

26:41.423 --> 26:43.827
Auxiliary's not working.
Shit!

26:45.961 --> 26:46.993
30 degrees up!

26:46.995 --> 26:48.729
Copy that!

26:48.731 --> 26:50.163
Pull back with me!
We gotta get this nose level!

26:50.165 --> 26:53.403
Let's go!
Come on, come on!

26:54.036 --> 26:56.605
(screaming)

27:09.851 --> 27:11.117
We're still dropping!

27:11.119 --> 27:12.685
We need to get
the engines working!

27:12.687 --> 27:14.988
We get 'em spinning,
the generators will run!

27:14.990 --> 27:16.357
What about the RAT?

27:16.359 --> 27:19.158
Well, we're too far out.
Not gonna work.

27:19.160 --> 27:21.263
Fire, damn it! Connect!

27:24.032 --> 27:25.601
(screaming)

27:43.185 --> 27:45.918
Come on, fire, damn it!
Connect!

27:45.920 --> 27:48.187
Connect, damn it!

27:48.189 --> 27:49.623
It's now or never, Jack!

27:49.625 --> 27:50.924
We're at the point
of no return!

27:50.926 --> 27:53.996
Hold on.
Hold on!

27:54.897 --> 27:56.996
Please work, please work.

27:56.998 --> 27:58.500
Please work, please!

27:59.101 --> 28:02.304
(screaming)

28:03.004 --> 28:05.472
Here we go!

28:05.474 --> 28:07.310
Come on, pull!

28:11.414 --> 28:13.650
(screaming)

28:24.961 --> 28:26.963
(panting)

28:27.763 --> 28:29.599
(clamoring)

28:35.370 --> 28:37.407
Thank God.

28:39.774 --> 28:42.108
Flight Lead,
please contact the cockpit.

28:42.110 --> 28:43.345
<i>Thank you.</i>

28:44.812 --> 28:47.513
Good work.

28:47.515 --> 28:50.049
I've never seen a plane
die like that before.

28:50.051 --> 28:53.521
I have, but not like that.

28:53.523 --> 28:55.388
Looks like you're getting
to see a lot of things

28:55.390 --> 28:58.724
you never seen before tonight.

28:58.726 --> 29:02.095
Jesus Christ, I think
I almost had a heart attack.

29:02.097 --> 29:04.732
(chuckles)

29:04.734 --> 29:06.032
(beeping)

29:06.034 --> 29:09.103
Okay.
Can you start the walkthrough?

29:09.105 --> 29:11.074
Yeah.

29:17.746 --> 29:19.180
<i>You okay back there?</i>

29:19.182 --> 29:21.915
(murmuring)

29:21.917 --> 29:24.151
Sir, you okay?

29:24.153 --> 29:26.552
How we doing over here?

29:26.554 --> 29:28.021
Yeah, I think so.

29:28.023 --> 29:29.588
That was a lot.

29:29.590 --> 29:32.893
How about everyone else?
Any injuries?

29:32.895 --> 29:35.061
I don't know.

29:35.063 --> 29:36.930
I haven't started
the walk-through yet.

29:36.932 --> 29:38.598
Copy that.

29:38.600 --> 29:41.434
<i>Looks like we're about
4:10 till we hit New York.</i>

29:41.436 --> 29:43.537
Just try to keep everyone
calm and comfortable.

29:43.539 --> 29:45.172
And let's see if
we can make this

29:45.174 --> 29:46.873
a better trip
from here on out.

29:46.875 --> 29:48.875
<i>Last thing we need is
a plane full of angry people.</i>

29:48.877 --> 29:51.878
Okay. Thank you so much.
Yes?

29:51.880 --> 29:53.880
Oh, sweetie, that looks bad.

29:53.882 --> 29:55.182
Oh, my God.

29:55.184 --> 29:56.415
Why don't we touch you up
in the restroom?

29:56.417 --> 29:58.085
I'm not qualified for this.

29:58.087 --> 30:00.690
Thanks.

30:05.160 --> 30:07.496
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

30:19.274 --> 30:21.075
Are you okay?
My apologies.

30:21.077 --> 30:23.146
They're doing
everything they can.

30:33.888 --> 30:36.322
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
apologies for the turbulence.</i>

30:36.324 --> 30:38.258
<i>As you may have gathered,</i>

30:38.260 --> 30:40.094
<i>our aircraft experienced
a brief loss of power</i>

30:40.096 --> 30:42.829
<i>which caused the drop
in altitude.</i>

30:42.831 --> 30:45.098
<i>But everything's
back in order.</i>

30:45.100 --> 30:49.168
<i>Good news is, planes are made
to handle situations like this.</i>

30:49.170 --> 30:50.604
<i>We hit a rough patch of sky.</i>

30:50.606 --> 30:52.204
<i>But it's our
number one priority</i>

30:52.206 --> 30:53.740
<i>to get you to New York,</i>

30:53.742 --> 30:55.642
<i>or wherever your
final destination</i>

30:55.644 --> 30:58.578
<i>may be with us this evening,
safe and sound.</i>

30:58.580 --> 31:00.146
<i>Hoping to have you on
the ground in</i>

31:00.148 --> 31:01.681
<i>just about four hours.</i>

31:01.683 --> 31:03.884
<i>So just sit back
and try to relax.</i>

31:03.886 --> 31:06.118
<i>We'll be sending the flight
crew through the cabin</i>

31:06.120 --> 31:07.988
<i>to make sure everyone's okay.</i>

31:07.990 --> 31:11.558
<i>Once again, we apologize
for the discomfort.</i>

31:11.560 --> 31:13.526
<i>On behalf of the airline
and the crew,</i>

31:13.528 --> 31:15.828
<i>we hope you enjoy the
remainder of the flight.</i>

31:15.830 --> 31:19.232
Hey, why... why am I...

31:19.234 --> 31:20.867
It's just a zip tie, okay?

31:20.869 --> 31:24.136
- Zip tie? But...
- Shh.

31:24.138 --> 31:25.771
You had an episode.

31:25.773 --> 31:27.507
I had to restrain you.

31:27.509 --> 31:30.677
- All I'm saying...
- It's for your own good.

31:30.679 --> 31:34.882
But... No, no.
You don't understand...

31:34.884 --> 31:36.883
I'm gonna tell
you one more time!

31:36.885 --> 31:38.050
Shh!

31:38.052 --> 31:39.520
Listen to me.

31:39.522 --> 31:43.723
You have the right
to remain silent.

31:43.725 --> 31:49.194
And if I were you, that's
exactly what I would do.

31:49.196 --> 31:50.329
All right.

31:50.331 --> 31:53.335
- Relax.
- Okay.

32:28.271 --> 32:31.240
(screams)

32:46.353 --> 32:49.758
JFK Center, PAN-US 57.

32:54.128 --> 32:59.767
LAX Center, PAN-US 57?
We've lost contact with JFK.

32:59.769 --> 33:01.671
Do you copy?

33:02.905 --> 33:07.074
Shit, I can't get anyone.

33:07.076 --> 33:10.743
They were updating us on
the pressure systems.

33:10.745 --> 33:13.746
This all happened after
we lost power.

33:13.748 --> 33:16.015
Keep trying.
They'll come back.

33:16.017 --> 33:18.385
What about the systems check?

33:18.387 --> 33:20.253
I've ran through the book.

33:20.255 --> 33:21.887
The plane can fly.

33:21.889 --> 33:27.263
But after the outage,
we got a few problems.

33:28.964 --> 33:32.265
According to the diagnostics,
the cabin pressure's good.

33:32.267 --> 33:35.401
Fuel's good.

33:35.403 --> 33:36.869
Landing gear...

33:36.871 --> 33:38.437
Landing gear is out.
Coms are down.

33:38.439 --> 33:40.139
And autopilot's gone?

33:40.141 --> 33:42.608
- Yeah.
- Okay, well...

33:42.610 --> 33:44.444
This plane may not be brand new,

33:44.446 --> 33:46.145
but it's one of the
greatest ever built.

33:46.147 --> 33:49.281
Keep our hands on the wheel,
we should be just fine.

33:49.283 --> 33:50.817
What about FMS?

33:50.819 --> 33:53.720
What happens if, for some
reason, we lose navigation?

33:53.722 --> 33:56.723
You've never flown one of
these things before, have you?

33:56.725 --> 33:59.193
Through a storm
with engine failure?

33:59.195 --> 34:01.228
Not really.

34:01.230 --> 34:02.428
(sighs)

34:02.430 --> 34:03.629
Keep calm, kid, all right?

34:03.631 --> 34:04.932
I've been through
worse than this.

34:04.934 --> 34:07.567
Keep your head on.

34:07.569 --> 34:10.273
What's ATIS saying about
the weather report?

34:13.409 --> 34:15.842
Well, still surrounded.

34:15.844 --> 34:18.645
Even if we wanted
to divert our path,

34:18.647 --> 34:21.148
according to the data,
there's no way around it

34:21.150 --> 34:23.351
and we're stuck in the middle.

34:28.357 --> 34:30.157
I can't see
anything out there.

34:30.159 --> 34:32.592
Look, equipment,
no equipment,

34:32.594 --> 34:36.496
radio or no radio,
storms only last so long.

34:36.498 --> 34:38.665
We'll be through this shortly.

34:38.667 --> 34:41.871
Your head.
Keep it on.

34:43.237 --> 34:44.806
I'll do my best.

34:48.476 --> 34:50.346
(ghost screams)

34:52.313 --> 34:55.518
(baby cries)

35:04.326 --> 35:07.797
(baby cries)

35:15.404 --> 35:17.337
What?
Oh my God!

35:17.339 --> 35:18.873
What?

35:20.308 --> 35:21.507
What's going on?

35:21.509 --> 35:24.446
Hello? Hello?

35:29.384 --> 35:31.684
Ma'am?

35:31.686 --> 35:33.656
Excuse me, ma'am?

35:35.023 --> 35:38.092
(baby cries)

35:38.094 --> 35:40.393
Ma'am, can you hear me?

35:40.395 --> 35:42.728
Ma'am?

35:42.730 --> 35:46.632
Can you let me know
that you're okay, please?

35:46.634 --> 35:48.835
Help! I can't get out!

35:48.837 --> 35:52.306
The door won't open!
Somebody, please help me!

35:52.308 --> 35:53.840
Ma'am?

35:53.842 --> 35:56.210
I'm sorry ma'am, the lock
override is stuck.

35:56.212 --> 35:58.177
I can't open the door
from this side.

35:58.179 --> 36:00.547
I can't get out!
Help me!

36:00.549 --> 36:02.215
Ma'am?

36:02.217 --> 36:05.451
Can you... Can you let me know
that you're okay, please?

36:05.453 --> 36:08.957
I can't get out!
Hello?

36:12.627 --> 36:14.896
(panicking)

36:17.532 --> 36:18.900
(screams)

36:26.808 --> 36:28.878
(crying)

36:53.802 --> 36:55.671
Ma'am, please.

36:57.505 --> 36:59.204
Ma'am? Please.

36:59.206 --> 37:01.474
Okay, someone's coming
to help, okay?

37:01.476 --> 37:02.842
Please just stay calm.

37:02.844 --> 37:05.378
If you can hear me, stay calm.

37:05.380 --> 37:08.348
What's up?

37:08.350 --> 37:11.516
I think that there's
a woman trapped inside.

37:11.518 --> 37:13.119
She's stuck?

37:13.121 --> 37:18.657
Yeah. The locking mechanism,
isn't working properly.

37:18.659 --> 37:20.527
All right, here.
Let me try.

37:20.529 --> 37:22.164
Okay.

37:29.505 --> 37:31.173
Ma'am?

37:34.543 --> 37:35.808
Ma'am?

37:35.810 --> 37:37.543
This is the U.S. Air Marshal.

37:37.545 --> 37:39.311
I need you to open
this door right now.

37:39.313 --> 37:42.315
Your right, the lock override
switch seems to be jammed.

37:42.317 --> 37:44.717
We need something
to pry open the door with.

37:44.719 --> 37:47.656
Oh, okay, we have, um...

37:56.397 --> 37:59.534
Oh, great. Um...

38:03.938 --> 38:05.471
(grunts)

38:05.473 --> 38:08.842
There's a killer
on your plane.

38:08.844 --> 38:10.677
(crying)

38:10.679 --> 38:11.844
All right.

38:11.846 --> 38:13.478
Ma'am, on the count
of three,

38:13.480 --> 38:15.614
I want you to push the door
open from the inside, okay?

38:15.616 --> 38:17.150
(ghost whispering)

38:17.152 --> 38:19.719
What?
What?

38:19.721 --> 38:22.521
I don't understand
what you're saying!

38:22.523 --> 38:23.523
There's a killer.

38:23.525 --> 38:27.626
One, two, three!

38:27.628 --> 38:29.395
(crying)

38:29.397 --> 38:32.166
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

38:33.835 --> 38:36.902
Okay. Come on, sweetie.
Come on.

38:36.904 --> 38:39.371
Come on.

38:39.373 --> 38:42.608
Okay, okay.
Shh, okay.

38:42.610 --> 38:44.578
Okay.

38:44.580 --> 38:46.112
This way.

38:46.114 --> 38:48.748
Yeah, can you take
a seat for me?

38:48.750 --> 38:50.686
Good girl, good girl.

38:53.422 --> 38:54.721
What happened?

38:54.723 --> 38:57.025
The mirror, the mirror!

38:58.625 --> 39:00.460
What about the mirror?

39:00.462 --> 39:03.596
I saw her.
She was pregnant.

39:03.598 --> 39:05.665
I couldn't breathe!

39:05.667 --> 39:07.302
That doesn't make any sense.

39:10.105 --> 39:12.072
We're gonna get you
to your seat,

39:12.074 --> 39:13.806
we're gonna get you
comfortable okay?

39:13.808 --> 39:15.741
Can you stand up for me?

39:15.743 --> 39:18.911
Come on, okay?

39:18.913 --> 39:21.748
It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.715
It's okay. It's okay.

39:23.717 --> 39:25.851
It's okay, all right?

39:25.853 --> 39:28.420
It's okay.

39:28.422 --> 39:30.322
Thank you.

39:30.324 --> 39:31.993
Go ahead, take a seat.

40:00.721 --> 40:02.621
What is going on?
Seriously.

40:02.623 --> 40:04.324
We're never flying this
flight again is what's going on.

40:04.326 --> 40:06.159
No, I'm serious, Bran!

40:06.161 --> 40:08.628
Okay, that guy freaks out,
there's maggots in the food!

40:08.630 --> 40:09.663
- Hey.
- No, no.

40:09.665 --> 40:11.130
People are throwing up,

40:11.132 --> 40:12.532
the lights are going out
in the plane.

40:12.534 --> 40:14.166
People are getting hurt,

40:14.168 --> 40:15.735
And that poor woman,
I don't know what's going on!

40:15.737 --> 40:17.402
I know.
I don't know either.

40:17.404 --> 40:20.373
We're in a... hey, we're in
a hell of a storm, okay?

40:20.375 --> 40:22.275
And storms pass, all right?

40:22.277 --> 40:24.677
- Are you okay?
- I thought we were gonna die.

40:24.679 --> 40:26.445
You're not gonna die.

40:26.447 --> 40:29.916
The Air Marshal said that
the crazy one was a terrorist.

40:29.918 --> 40:32.018
Okay, ma'am,
he didn't say that.

40:32.020 --> 40:33.351
I think he actually said
the opposite.

40:33.353 --> 40:35.020
Hey, what are we supposed

40:35.022 --> 40:36.556
to do when there's
a crazy person on the plane?

40:36.558 --> 40:38.157
I mean, what if he hurts
somebody?

40:38.159 --> 40:40.192
Okay, well, maybe
we shouldn't call him crazy?

40:40.194 --> 40:42.027
And what's this
talk about ghosts?

40:42.029 --> 40:43.630
Okay, nothing, right?

40:43.632 --> 40:45.098
It's just...

40:45.100 --> 40:48.199
We're all just a little
frazzled right now.

40:48.201 --> 40:50.869
It's a malfunction,
a malfunction of the plane.

40:50.871 --> 40:52.070
That's it.

40:52.072 --> 40:53.639
Look, all I know is
you better

40:53.641 --> 40:55.208
keep that man away from
me.

40:55.210 --> 40:57.175
'Cause I just want
to get on the ground.

40:57.177 --> 40:59.112
You know, maybe we got
struck by lightning, you know?

40:59.114 --> 41:00.514
I mean, that explains
the power going in and out.

41:00.516 --> 41:02.516
Lightning hits planes
in the air all the time.

41:02.518 --> 41:04.183
What?
Are you a mechanic?

41:04.185 --> 41:06.085
No, I'm a teacher
and I watch the news.

41:06.087 --> 41:08.353
Okay, you know what?
Cool it, all right?

41:08.355 --> 41:10.724
We're in a storm, okay?
We're on a plane.

41:10.726 --> 41:12.190
The plane is a machine.

41:12.192 --> 41:13.893
If you so much as use
your cell phone,

41:13.895 --> 41:15.594
the signals get
jumbled, all right?

41:15.596 --> 41:17.563
So if we're this high up
covered by clouds surrounded

41:17.565 --> 41:20.666
by lightning, of course,
some shit's gonna go wrong.

41:20.668 --> 41:22.467
So, please stop
making accusations

41:22.469 --> 41:24.170
if you guys don't even
know it's true.

41:24.172 --> 41:27.507
You'll only make everyone panic.

41:27.509 --> 41:28.741
Exactly.

41:28.743 --> 41:30.442
Everyone just take
a deep breath.

41:30.444 --> 41:33.846
Sit back and try to relax.

41:33.848 --> 41:36.016
Are you sure
everything's normal?

41:36.018 --> 41:39.284
No, I'm not sure,

41:39.286 --> 41:43.255
but it's not supernatural.

41:43.257 --> 41:46.759
We're on a plane and
planes have problems.

41:46.761 --> 41:48.860
Something's not right, Bran.

41:48.862 --> 41:51.764
I know, look.

41:51.766 --> 41:53.800
How about we take our
mind off this?

41:53.802 --> 41:55.634
Like music maybe?

41:55.636 --> 41:57.570
You still haven't listened
to the mix tape

41:57.572 --> 42:00.806
that my brother put on
your phone in L.A., right?

42:00.808 --> 42:02.942
I don't know.
I don't know.

42:02.944 --> 42:04.177
It feels weird.

42:04.179 --> 42:07.045
Okay, okay,
babe, babe, babe.

42:07.047 --> 42:10.949
We're in a storm,
but storms pass, okay?

42:10.951 --> 42:13.886
Now if I open my carry-on
and snakes fall out...

42:13.888 --> 42:15.320
(chuckles)

42:15.322 --> 42:16.790
I'll be the first to
let you know, okay?

42:16.792 --> 42:18.927
- Okay.
- Okay.

42:37.846 --> 42:40.212
Hey!
Listen to me!

42:40.214 --> 42:41.815
You're really stupid
if you think

42:41.817 --> 42:44.550
I'm letting you
out of my sight.

42:44.552 --> 42:46.121
Relax!

42:47.889 --> 42:51.090
(hip-hop music plays)

42:51.092 --> 42:53.796
Revenge!
He wouldn't stop!

42:58.567 --> 43:00.866
Did you say something to me?

43:00.868 --> 43:02.969
What?

43:02.971 --> 43:06.672
I... um...

43:06.674 --> 43:08.509
I thought I heard something.

43:11.545 --> 43:14.980
(hip-hop music plays)

43:14.982 --> 43:16.215
Where are you?

43:16.217 --> 43:19.853
Please help!
So dark down here...

43:19.855 --> 43:21.987
Okay, did you not hear that?

43:21.989 --> 43:23.755
Hear what?

43:23.757 --> 43:27.960
There's someone trying to call
me or speak to me or something.

43:27.962 --> 43:29.596
What?

43:29.598 --> 43:32.431
(hip-hop music playing)

43:32.433 --> 43:34.599
What am I trying to hear?
I don't hear anything.

43:34.601 --> 43:37.138
- Brandon?
- What?

43:42.643 --> 43:44.178
Nothing.

43:46.947 --> 43:49.384
(hip-hop music playing)

43:57.359 --> 43:59.058
Murder!

43:59.060 --> 44:01.326
Shit! Did you mess with
my volume or something?

44:01.328 --> 44:02.329
No.

44:02.331 --> 44:03.596
Oh, my God!

44:03.598 --> 44:05.197
Did you sit on it
or something? Jesus!

44:05.199 --> 44:06.065
No!

44:06.067 --> 44:08.237
Are my ears bleeding?

44:11.139 --> 44:14.042
Danika, what's going on?
You're scaring me.

44:22.817 --> 44:24.849
My...

44:24.851 --> 44:26.520
Hey.

44:53.281 --> 44:55.016
(beeping)

44:56.618 --> 44:57.483
Captain?

44:57.485 --> 44:58.817
What the...

44:58.819 --> 45:00.552
Alice, there's
procedure for a reason.

45:00.554 --> 45:02.654
You can't just barge
in here like that.

45:02.656 --> 45:04.357
Look, three hours and some
change, we'll be on the ground.

45:04.359 --> 45:06.458
That's what
I'm worried about.

45:06.460 --> 45:09.996
That's what we're all
worried about.

45:09.998 --> 45:11.463
We're losing this flight.

45:11.465 --> 45:13.433
I need you to take control now!

45:13.435 --> 45:14.800
I'm sorry?

45:14.802 --> 45:17.703
So far, we've had a
lightning storm, rotten food.

45:17.705 --> 45:20.873
People having panic attacks.
And then losing power?

45:20.875 --> 45:23.942
I don't know what this is
but it isn't normal.

45:23.944 --> 45:26.013
(thunder)

45:28.081 --> 45:29.681
She's got a point.

45:29.683 --> 45:33.686
Look, Alice.
I need you to calm down, okay?

45:33.688 --> 45:35.520
It's a rough flight.

45:35.522 --> 45:37.489
But you've been doing this
long enough, you should know.

45:37.491 --> 45:39.157
All right, I don't know
what's going on back there.

45:39.159 --> 45:40.793
I have no idea
what the problem is.

45:40.795 --> 45:42.695
But I can't be back there
to fix it personally.

45:42.697 --> 45:44.130
I'm doing everything I can
to keep us in the air!

45:44.132 --> 45:45.898
Yes, sir. I...

45:45.900 --> 45:47.699
Oh, I know you're trying
and you're doing a great job.

45:47.701 --> 45:50.339
It's just we're doing
all we can up here.

45:51.839 --> 45:53.542
Sorry, Alice.

45:55.177 --> 45:57.379
Yes, sir.
I understand.

45:59.279 --> 46:02.348
Look, I'm not trying
to be a hard-ass here.

46:02.350 --> 46:05.851
It's just that, if we can
all make it through

46:05.853 --> 46:10.257
this flight without losing
our minds, drinks are on me.

46:19.067 --> 46:21.835
You seeing this?

46:21.837 --> 46:23.739
See what?

46:24.873 --> 46:26.575
What is that?

46:30.377 --> 46:32.480
Up there in the clouds?

46:33.514 --> 46:35.047
Are those birds?

46:35.049 --> 46:37.717
Uh, that's impossible.

46:37.719 --> 46:40.320
Birds don't fly
at this altitude.

46:40.322 --> 46:42.457
Well, then what
in the world...

46:49.663 --> 46:52.133
Are those people?

46:55.069 --> 46:56.536
What are you talking about?

46:56.538 --> 46:58.137
Captain, I...

46:58.139 --> 46:59.637
I don't see anything.

46:59.639 --> 47:02.342
You're not seeing this?
Right here!

47:02.344 --> 47:04.346
I swear to Christ!

47:11.185 --> 47:13.485
People?

47:13.487 --> 47:17.021
Uh, you want me to
take over for a minute?

47:17.023 --> 47:20.092
Maybe, you know, I think a
break might do you some good.

47:20.094 --> 47:21.427
Maybe some coffee or something?

47:21.429 --> 47:23.128
A break?
No, I don't need a break.

47:23.130 --> 47:24.563
Shit!

47:24.565 --> 47:27.168
A bottle of water,
please, Alice?

47:32.940 --> 47:36.208
Jack, there's no shame
in being exhausted.

47:36.210 --> 47:38.309
It's a red-eye direct
coast to coast.

47:38.311 --> 47:40.112
And look at what
we're flying in.

47:40.114 --> 47:42.083
I know. I'm just...

47:42.984 --> 47:44.650
Scared?

47:44.652 --> 47:46.851
Yeah, me too.

47:46.853 --> 47:49.857
Yeah, maybe a little.

47:51.326 --> 47:53.291
I don't know.
Something's not right.

47:53.293 --> 47:56.297
Something just
doesn't feel right.

47:57.598 --> 48:00.132
Your hands have been shaking.

48:00.134 --> 48:03.136
Are they?

48:03.138 --> 48:05.574
Didn't even notice.

48:06.708 --> 48:09.041
I guess I just got
a lot on my mind.

48:09.043 --> 48:10.511
(beeping)

48:15.282 --> 48:16.618
Thanks.

48:21.154 --> 48:23.290
What'd you see?

48:28.763 --> 48:30.632
I don't know.

49:01.328 --> 49:03.397
(whispering voices)

50:07.527 --> 50:10.331
Make sure this
stays open, okay?

50:21.009 --> 50:22.644
Dani?

50:42.830 --> 50:44.866
(baby crying)

50:47.402 --> 50:50.538
(screams)

51:13.060 --> 51:14.862
Brandon?

51:16.063 --> 51:17.228
What?

51:17.230 --> 51:19.431
I don't feel well.

51:19.433 --> 51:21.335
What's going on?

51:22.737 --> 51:24.436
Would you think it was
weird if I thought

51:24.438 --> 51:28.475
there was something else
on this flight?

51:30.411 --> 51:33.078
Is it like your
Frankenstein thing?

51:33.080 --> 51:34.712
No.

51:34.714 --> 51:37.016
I'm not following.

51:37.018 --> 51:38.683
Dani?
Dani?

51:38.685 --> 51:42.353
Honey, hey!
Dani!

51:42.355 --> 51:44.625
Are you okay?

51:46.460 --> 51:48.360
Do you have aspirin?

51:48.362 --> 51:49.994
Uh, yeah.

51:49.996 --> 51:52.533
I think there's some
in my carry-on.

51:58.438 --> 52:00.808
(gasps)

52:02.277 --> 52:05.347
(baby cries)

52:16.590 --> 52:19.094
The killer...

52:20.594 --> 52:23.598
There's a killer on this plane.

52:25.165 --> 52:26.465
I... I...

52:26.467 --> 52:27.799
I don't know
what's happening!

52:27.801 --> 52:30.001
There's a killer
on this plane!

52:30.003 --> 52:32.070
There's a killer
on this plane!

52:32.072 --> 52:34.572
There's a killer...

52:34.574 --> 52:36.208
Dani?
Dani!

52:36.210 --> 52:37.645
Hey!

52:38.913 --> 52:41.480
Hey, babe, hey.

52:41.482 --> 52:43.916
You're okay,
you're okay.

52:43.918 --> 52:45.750
Look at me, look at me.
You're fine.

52:45.752 --> 52:47.219
You're okay.
You're okay.

52:47.221 --> 52:49.924
Come on.
Okay, come on.

52:51.159 --> 52:54.462
You're okay. Come on.
Come on, honey.

52:55.462 --> 52:57.529
It's okay, it's all right.

52:57.531 --> 52:58.630
What happened?

52:58.632 --> 53:02.266
Get it away from me!

53:02.268 --> 53:04.703
Get what away from you?
There's nothing there.

53:04.705 --> 53:07.206
Baby, look,
there's nothing there.

53:07.208 --> 53:08.641
Dani, look, look.

53:08.643 --> 53:10.375
Look, look. There's nothing
there, babe.

53:10.377 --> 53:14.579
Hey! How about you two quit
freaking everybody out!

53:14.581 --> 53:16.181
We're not trying
to freak anybody out!

53:16.183 --> 53:18.284
Guys, keep your
voices down, all right?

53:18.286 --> 53:20.284
This is not making it better.
In fact, it's making it worse.

53:20.286 --> 53:21.753
- This is some bullshit!
- Sir...

53:21.755 --> 53:24.525
I'm just trying
to calm her down!

53:25.860 --> 53:27.829
Better?

53:28.462 --> 53:29.994
What did you see?

53:29.996 --> 53:31.596
A woman, I think.

53:31.598 --> 53:35.500
She was dead in the bin.
Stuffed in there!

53:35.502 --> 53:37.802
I opened it and
she grabbed me.

53:37.804 --> 53:40.338
And I know there's
nothing there

53:40.340 --> 53:42.708
but it looked and
it felt so real!

53:42.710 --> 53:44.543
I believe you.

53:44.545 --> 53:46.244
- You do?
- Yeah.

53:46.246 --> 53:48.846
Something's going on here.
We just need to find out what.

53:48.848 --> 53:51.616
Hey, is she all right?

53:51.618 --> 53:55.654
Uh, yeah, I think so.

53:55.656 --> 53:57.857
I'm fine. I promise.

53:57.859 --> 53:59.657
I just don't know
what's going on.

53:59.659 --> 54:01.659
All right, I'm done.
Look, excuse me.

54:01.661 --> 54:03.262
I'm gonna go to the bathroom,
all right?

54:03.264 --> 54:05.467
You really don't wanna
go to the bathroom!

54:07.802 --> 54:12.670
Oh, great.
Mr. Crazy Man's awake.

54:12.672 --> 54:14.940
Please don't say it, okay?

54:14.942 --> 54:16.875
There are no
terrorists on this plane.

54:16.877 --> 54:20.748
Look, Mr. Marshal.
Come here.

54:24.351 --> 54:27.953
Why don't we just tie her
ass to the chair and...

54:27.955 --> 54:29.154
Sir!

54:29.156 --> 54:30.489
I won't let you
tie her down!

54:30.491 --> 54:32.056
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

54:32.058 --> 54:33.991
No one's gonna get tied down
to anything, okay?

54:33.993 --> 54:35.695
You keep her calm,
you got nothing to worry about.

54:35.697 --> 54:37.228
Right.
I just don't understand, okay?

54:37.230 --> 54:39.130
I don't understand
what's going on.

54:39.132 --> 54:40.733
I don't understand
what's going on with my wife.

54:40.735 --> 54:42.201
Look, nobody knows
what's going on.

54:42.203 --> 54:43.902
But the one thing that
I do know is

54:43.904 --> 54:45.637
that I trust the man
with the badge.

54:45.639 --> 54:47.405
And the gun?

54:47.407 --> 54:51.476
Look, there's a lot of crazy
unseen shit going on here.

54:51.478 --> 54:53.011
I don't know what it is.

54:53.013 --> 54:54.646
But I do know that this woman
here has to be detained!

54:54.648 --> 54:56.415
Hey, hey, hey!
Enough.

54:56.417 --> 54:58.016
Easy! Enough!
Listen to me.

54:58.018 --> 54:59.684
We are just trying to get
back to our families

54:59.686 --> 55:01.186
just like everybody
in this place.

55:01.188 --> 55:02.721
Get to your seat.
Just get to your seat.

55:02.723 --> 55:04.556
Hey, enough! Enough!

55:04.558 --> 55:06.058
I said in your seat now!

55:06.060 --> 55:09.163
Sit down! Hey!
In your seat now!

55:10.730 --> 55:12.364
Now listen up!

55:12.366 --> 55:17.001
I need everyone to keep
their head on their shoulders!

55:17.003 --> 55:19.105
Let's stay calm, okay?

55:19.107 --> 55:20.905
Now I don't
think it's terrorism.

55:20.907 --> 55:22.907
So let's stop using that word.

55:22.909 --> 55:25.509
That word just gets
everyone worked up.

55:25.511 --> 55:27.779
- Yeah, but what if...
- Don't!

55:27.781 --> 55:29.447
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

55:29.449 --> 55:31.284
What? Are we in North Korea now?
We can't express ourselves?

55:31.286 --> 55:33.819
Really?
Are you serious?

55:33.821 --> 55:36.020
Look, I'm sorry.

55:36.022 --> 55:37.655
I'm not usually this
much of an asshole.

55:37.657 --> 55:38.958
I just wanna get
on the ground!

55:38.960 --> 55:40.425
Hey! Hey!

55:40.427 --> 55:42.695
Look, it's scary when
the plane malfunctions.

55:42.697 --> 55:44.329
It is.

55:44.331 --> 55:46.098
But we are people who
do this for a living.

55:46.100 --> 55:48.636
So let us do our job
and we will be fine.

55:50.003 --> 55:52.637
See? That's exactly what
I was saying, malfunction.

55:52.639 --> 55:54.038
So what are
we talking about here?

55:54.040 --> 55:55.641
Gas leak?
Loss of cabin pressure?

55:55.643 --> 55:57.043
I didn't say that.

55:57.045 --> 55:58.509
How much longer until
we get to New York?

55:58.511 --> 56:00.012
Are we gonna be okay?

56:00.014 --> 56:01.313
It's just gonna be
a couple more hours, okay?

56:01.315 --> 56:02.681
We're almost there.

56:02.683 --> 56:04.282
Miss?

56:04.284 --> 56:06.317
Could you please check
in with the captain?

56:06.319 --> 56:08.989
Make sure all the mechanical
issues are in order, please?

56:14.828 --> 56:16.795
What do you think
is going on here?

56:16.797 --> 56:19.630
We are losing
electricity often.

56:19.632 --> 56:21.599
It's a good place to start.

56:21.601 --> 56:23.067
I'm no mechanic.

56:23.069 --> 56:24.737
But I'm sure the captain's
doing everything

56:24.739 --> 56:26.438
he's supposed to be doing
on his end.

56:26.440 --> 56:29.773
Most important thing is
we're still in the air.

56:29.775 --> 56:31.775
We got that going for us.

56:31.777 --> 56:33.612
Fantastic, fantastic.

56:33.614 --> 56:35.815
Finally, somebody that knows
what the hell they're doing.

56:35.817 --> 56:38.583
Hey, sir, you keep
talking like that,

56:38.585 --> 56:41.119
the two of us are gonna have
a real serious problem.

56:41.121 --> 56:43.755
So I need you to sit here
and keep your mouth shut.

56:43.757 --> 56:45.757
You got that?

56:45.759 --> 56:47.828
Yeah.

56:48.761 --> 56:50.862
I'm so sorry about all this.

56:50.864 --> 56:52.563
Hey, hey...

56:52.565 --> 56:54.933
Hey, don't be
sorry, okay?

56:54.935 --> 56:58.036
You didn't do anything wrong.

56:58.038 --> 56:59.804
I don't know what's happening.

56:59.806 --> 57:02.474
Did you take the aspirin?

57:02.476 --> 57:04.009
Of course, but I wouldn't...

57:04.011 --> 57:05.677
Don't worry, sweetheart.

57:05.679 --> 57:07.478
You all do realize
that if there is

57:07.480 --> 57:10.349
a major malfunction while we're
in the air during a storm,

57:10.351 --> 57:11.884
that's worse
than ghosts, right?

57:11.886 --> 57:13.319
Because that can
actually kill us.

57:13.321 --> 57:15.087
Okay, the plane
is not haunted.

57:15.089 --> 57:17.489
That's an insane theory.

57:17.491 --> 57:19.958
Look, why don't
we just land the plane

57:19.960 --> 57:21.826
and check for problems
on the ground?

57:21.828 --> 57:23.862
Look, has the captain
mentioned anything

57:23.864 --> 57:25.898
about when and where
we're gonna land?

57:25.900 --> 57:27.967
From what I can tell,
the storm

57:27.969 --> 57:30.101
is making it hard
to get anywhere.

57:30.103 --> 57:31.869
I mean, at this point,
trying to land in this,

57:31.871 --> 57:34.241
we're safer up here.

57:37.177 --> 57:39.677
Excuse me?

57:39.679 --> 57:41.079
What about the storm?

57:41.081 --> 57:42.815
Do you have any idea
when it'll be behind us?

57:42.817 --> 57:45.550
No. I mean, at this point, the
storm's blanketing everything.

57:45.552 --> 57:47.219
It seems to be
tracking with us.

57:47.221 --> 57:49.654
- Excuse me!
- What do you want?

57:49.656 --> 57:50.889
It's not electrical.

57:50.891 --> 57:53.994
(clamoring)

58:36.670 --> 58:40.808
(screams)

58:42.342 --> 58:44.978
(woman crying)

58:46.848 --> 58:49.150
(panting)

58:54.255 --> 58:56.721
(beeping)

58:56.723 --> 58:58.690
We need to do an
emergency landing now!

58:58.692 --> 58:59.657
It's real!

58:59.659 --> 59:01.226
What's real?

59:01.228 --> 59:03.061
Look, we can't land until
the storm clears up, Alice!

59:03.063 --> 59:05.197
- You know that!
- We need to land it now, Jack!

59:05.199 --> 59:06.998
Alice, what's going on?

59:07.000 --> 59:10.101
It's ghosts!
The plane is haunted!

59:10.103 --> 59:12.938
Again with this?
Ryan?

59:12.940 --> 59:14.306
Look, we're all tired.

59:14.308 --> 59:16.875
No, no, no, no.
You need to listen to me!

59:16.877 --> 59:19.512
You don't know
what we just saw.

59:19.514 --> 59:21.079
This lady down in the aisle!

59:21.081 --> 59:23.181
You're the only ones
that didn't see it!

59:23.183 --> 59:25.250
Will you maybe sit down
for just a little bit?

59:25.252 --> 59:27.152
I'm getting worried about you.

59:27.154 --> 59:28.887
We're gonna be on the ground
in like 95 minutes or...

59:28.889 --> 59:30.389
No, listen! No!

59:30.391 --> 59:32.157
The longer that
we're up here,

59:32.159 --> 59:33.625
the longer the lives
of everybody up here

59:33.627 --> 59:35.192
- is in jeopardy!
- Yeah?

59:35.194 --> 59:36.927
Where do you want me
to land, Alice, huh?

59:36.929 --> 59:38.396
Our coms are out.

59:38.398 --> 59:40.565
The storm's been on
us since takeoff.

59:40.567 --> 59:43.268
We're on our own
with nowhere to go!

59:43.270 --> 59:45.637
The plane is haunted.
Would you listen to yourself?

59:45.639 --> 59:49.174
We're not gonna land the plane
because you're superstitious!

59:49.176 --> 59:52.645
I mean, why would ghosts
want to haunt this plane?

59:52.647 --> 59:54.913
For revenge.

59:54.915 --> 59:56.380
Excuse me?

59:56.382 --> 59:57.581
What did you say?

59:57.583 --> 59:59.219
Revenge!

01:00:00.052 --> 01:00:03.755
Ryan, leave your belts on.

01:00:03.757 --> 01:00:04.991
Ryan?

01:00:05.926 --> 01:00:07.826
Ryan...

01:00:07.828 --> 01:00:09.996
Revenge!

01:00:11.732 --> 01:00:12.764
(screams)

01:00:12.766 --> 01:00:16.201
Ryan!

01:00:16.203 --> 01:00:18.436
Stop!

01:00:18.438 --> 01:00:22.007
(screaming)

01:00:22.009 --> 01:00:24.309
Ryan, stop!

01:00:24.311 --> 01:00:26.614
Stop!

01:00:27.547 --> 01:00:29.815
What are you doing?

01:00:29.817 --> 01:00:33.020
(screaming)

01:00:35.054 --> 01:00:37.424
In your seats!

01:00:44.998 --> 01:00:47.398
Ryan, what are you doing?
Stop!

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.603
(screaming)

01:01:07.955 --> 01:01:10.489
(screams)

01:01:10.491 --> 01:01:12.059
Hey, hey, hey!

01:01:13.826 --> 01:01:14.826
Get off of him!

01:01:14.828 --> 01:01:16.931
(coughing)

01:01:19.433 --> 01:01:21.534
(clamoring)

01:01:22.935 --> 01:01:27.338
(coughing)

01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:29.210
You okay?

01:01:32.179 --> 01:01:33.978
You're not flying autopilot?

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:36.014
No.

01:01:36.016 --> 01:01:38.386
We lost it when
the plane lost power.

01:01:39.953 --> 01:01:43.290
What the hell happened?

01:01:57.971 --> 01:01:59.003
(panting)

01:01:59.005 --> 01:02:01.208
(crying)

01:02:18.025 --> 01:02:19.994
I'm so sorry, Ryan.

01:02:20.927 --> 01:02:22.393
All right.

01:02:22.395 --> 01:02:24.529
I don't know what
the hell we just saw.

01:02:24.531 --> 01:02:26.197
But something's
definitely wrong.

01:02:26.199 --> 01:02:29.203
We agree on that, right?

01:02:33.406 --> 01:02:35.072
I mean, you said
there's something

01:02:35.074 --> 01:02:36.940
physically wrong
with the plane, right?

01:02:36.942 --> 01:02:39.677
No, not anything that's gonna
cause hallucinations or visions.

01:02:39.679 --> 01:02:42.614
I don't know what would cause
us to see the things we saw.

01:02:42.616 --> 01:02:45.183
Okay, well, let's start
from the beginning.

01:02:45.185 --> 01:02:48.320
So the storm started
soon after takeoff.

01:02:48.322 --> 01:02:51.924
Precheck was fine.
Luggage was fine.

01:02:51.926 --> 01:02:53.925
Mr. Peck in 25A...

01:02:53.927 --> 01:02:55.360
Yeah, poor guy.

01:02:55.362 --> 01:02:59.197
And Mr. Peck claimed that
he saw something unusual

01:02:59.199 --> 01:03:00.632
on the wing of the plane

01:03:00.634 --> 01:03:03.201
and then he went to
the bathroom to cool off

01:03:03.203 --> 01:03:05.203
and then he got spooked again.

01:03:05.205 --> 01:03:07.873
Well, I know what I saw
in the bathroom was real.

01:03:07.875 --> 01:03:10.409
The woman in the bathroom,
she was in the mirror

01:03:10.411 --> 01:03:12.076
and she was
reaching out for me.

01:03:12.078 --> 01:03:14.246
And then I fell
through the floor.

01:03:14.248 --> 01:03:15.980
I couldn't
get the door unlocked.

01:03:15.982 --> 01:03:17.849
Me either.
I tried, but I couldn't.

01:03:17.851 --> 01:03:21.386
It felt like it was being
held from the inside.

01:03:21.388 --> 01:03:22.987
We checked it, though.

01:03:22.989 --> 01:03:25.223
I mean, there's nothing
physically unusual about it.

01:03:25.225 --> 01:03:27.324
Okay, then the plane
lost power and we fell.

01:03:27.326 --> 01:03:30.596
And then the food
was spoiled somehow.

01:03:30.598 --> 01:03:33.768
I heard a woman scream
through my earbuds.

01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:38.603
Scream?

01:03:38.605 --> 01:03:41.139
Scream what?

01:03:41.141 --> 01:03:43.407
At first it was whispers.

01:03:43.409 --> 01:03:45.643
Then it got louder.

01:03:45.645 --> 01:03:50.882
It sounded like
she said, "Murder".

01:03:50.884 --> 01:03:53.886
Well, then that's
when my phone stopped working.

01:03:53.888 --> 01:03:55.253
Mine too.

01:03:55.255 --> 01:03:57.621
I thought I was
the only one.

01:03:57.623 --> 01:04:00.259
And there was something
really weird on my screen.

01:04:00.261 --> 01:04:02.159
What was it?

01:04:02.161 --> 01:04:03.462
A sonogram.

01:04:03.464 --> 01:04:04.962
A what?

01:04:04.964 --> 01:04:07.465
You know, like when
you take pictures of babies

01:04:07.467 --> 01:04:09.134
from a pregnant lady.

01:04:09.136 --> 01:04:11.270
That woman in the aisle.

01:04:11.272 --> 01:04:14.505
And then Ryan going crazy
and attacking Jack.

01:04:14.507 --> 01:04:17.442
Then the corpse
in the overhead bin.

01:04:17.444 --> 01:04:19.978
And now someone's
written "murder"

01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:21.815
on the outside of your window.

01:04:29.755 --> 01:04:32.456
Okay, so what are
we looking for?

01:04:32.458 --> 01:04:34.092
And where do we even start?

01:04:34.094 --> 01:04:35.994
I mean, it has to be coming
from around here somewhere.

01:04:35.996 --> 01:04:38.230
Well, it all started in
the front of the plane.

01:04:38.232 --> 01:04:39.864
But I already checked
the bathroom, though.

01:04:39.866 --> 01:04:41.800
And we've been up there
most of the flight.

01:04:41.802 --> 01:04:44.735
That wouldn't explain the
phones or the overhead bins.

01:04:44.737 --> 01:04:47.172
Or what happened
in the cockpit.

01:04:47.174 --> 01:04:48.505
We're so screwed.

01:04:48.507 --> 01:04:50.574
No, we're not screwed,
guys, okay?

01:04:50.576 --> 01:04:52.643
Listen, we just need
to find the source

01:04:52.645 --> 01:04:55.615
to what the hell
is going on right now.

01:04:56.183 --> 01:04:57.751
Ryan?

01:05:00.119 --> 01:05:02.152
Where am I?

01:05:02.154 --> 01:05:03.288
I can't move my hands.

01:05:03.290 --> 01:05:04.523
It's on purpose, kid.

01:05:04.525 --> 01:05:07.259
- What happened?
- You attacked Jack.

01:05:07.261 --> 01:05:09.061
What?

01:05:09.063 --> 01:05:10.261
You got crazy eyes

01:05:10.263 --> 01:05:11.395
and went straight
for the throat.

01:05:11.397 --> 01:05:13.633
Why would I do that?

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.335
All right, listen up.

01:05:16.337 --> 01:05:19.605
I know it's been a crazy night
for all of us.

01:05:19.607 --> 01:05:21.440
But there has to be
a perfectly reasonable

01:05:21.442 --> 01:05:23.175
explanation for all of this!

01:05:23.177 --> 01:05:25.677
There are only
so many places to look.

01:05:25.679 --> 01:05:29.848
If not the cabin, the front
or the back, what else is there?

01:05:29.850 --> 01:05:33.083
Okay, well, we decided
that it started on the wing.

01:05:33.085 --> 01:05:36.020
And now we have that
word written on his window...

01:05:36.022 --> 01:05:38.290
Yeah, but we can't check
outside on the wing right now.

01:05:38.292 --> 01:05:40.393
We're in the middle
of a flight.

01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:45.063
What about the manifest?

01:05:45.065 --> 01:05:47.498
Is there anything onboard
that's out of the ordinary?

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.366
Nothing that I know of.

01:05:49.368 --> 01:05:51.703
No special packages
from museums?

01:05:51.705 --> 01:05:53.304
No dead soldiers
being transferred

01:05:53.306 --> 01:05:55.105
at home from Afghanistan?

01:05:55.107 --> 01:05:56.206
Brandon?

01:05:56.208 --> 01:05:57.842
What are you saying, man?

01:05:57.844 --> 01:06:00.378
I mean, objects could
be conduits for spirits.

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:01.478
Okay. Maybe there's
something on the plane

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:03.215
that's traveling with it.

01:06:03.217 --> 01:06:07.488
Okay, so if there's nothing
on the manifest, what do we do?

01:06:10.456 --> 01:06:13.157
What were you saying?

01:06:13.159 --> 01:06:15.192
When?

01:06:15.194 --> 01:06:18.130
When you said you fell through
the floor, where did you go?

01:06:18.132 --> 01:06:20.498
Um, I don't know.

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:23.268
The cargo hold, I think.
Why?

01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:25.369
Because I saw that too.

01:06:25.371 --> 01:06:27.438
When I fell back
against the seat

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.877
and then I was
in the cargo hold.

01:06:31.712 --> 01:06:33.714
Babe...

01:06:34.815 --> 01:06:37.382
There was someone there.

01:06:37.384 --> 01:06:40.554
And I don't...
And I don't know, but...

01:06:41.654 --> 01:06:43.957
I felt like
they needed my help.

01:06:47.261 --> 01:06:48.826
What... What are you saying?

01:06:48.828 --> 01:06:52.730
There's something...
something happened.

01:06:52.732 --> 01:06:55.333
Something bad.

01:06:55.335 --> 01:06:57.268
We have to go down there.

01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:58.536
Babe...

01:06:58.538 --> 01:07:01.271
If we are having visions
of the same thing

01:07:01.273 --> 01:07:02.773
in the same location,

01:07:02.775 --> 01:07:05.444
something is telling us
to go down there.

01:07:05.446 --> 01:07:07.748
The luggage.

01:07:15.322 --> 01:07:18.322
Speak up.

01:07:18.324 --> 01:07:19.523
The luggage.

01:07:19.525 --> 01:07:22.092
I don't know what's going on.

01:07:22.094 --> 01:07:25.295
But talking about it isn't
going to solve anything.

01:07:25.297 --> 01:07:28.632
Like she said,
we need to go down there

01:07:28.634 --> 01:07:30.770
and see for ourselves.

01:07:33.473 --> 01:07:35.338
If I find out you
had something to do with this,

01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:37.007
you are in a
big world of hurt.

01:07:37.009 --> 01:07:38.744
Do you understand that?

01:07:38.746 --> 01:07:40.478
How? How?

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.484
You tied me
and put me in a chair.

01:07:45.384 --> 01:07:47.652
Cut him loose.

01:07:47.654 --> 01:07:51.121
Yeah, cut him loose.

01:07:51.123 --> 01:07:53.257
Any of us would have
freaked out in that bathroom.

01:07:53.259 --> 01:07:54.991
(sighs)

01:07:54.993 --> 01:07:57.527
Miss, would you happen
to have any scissors, please?

01:07:57.529 --> 01:08:00.868
Yes. Thank you.

01:08:11.677 --> 01:08:13.811
Don't make me regret this.

01:08:13.813 --> 01:08:15.882
You won't.

01:08:18.317 --> 01:08:20.053
Ah, God.

01:08:22.356 --> 01:08:25.090
Okay.

01:08:25.091 --> 01:08:27.024
Here's what's gonna
happen next.

01:08:27.026 --> 01:08:28.792
You're all gonna go
back to your seats

01:08:28.794 --> 01:08:30.394
and I'm gonna go down
to the cargo area

01:08:30.395 --> 01:08:31.996
and check it out for myself.

01:08:31.997 --> 01:08:34.966
I'm sorry. Sorry, guys.
No one can go down to cargo.

01:08:34.968 --> 01:08:36.966
Do you want this to come
to an end or not?

01:08:36.969 --> 01:08:39.938
Because I gotta cover
all my bases here.

01:08:39.939 --> 01:08:41.473
- I'm going with you.
- Dani...

01:08:41.475 --> 01:08:43.573
No, you are not going with me.

01:08:43.576 --> 01:08:48.444
No! It was speaking to me!
I saw it!

01:08:48.447 --> 01:08:50.314
I'm not gonna sit
up here and wait

01:08:50.316 --> 01:08:51.616
for someone else
to figure it out!

01:08:51.618 --> 01:08:53.451
I'm going!

01:08:53.453 --> 01:08:54.652
No, you're not going!

01:08:54.654 --> 01:08:56.787
Look, I'm going too.

01:08:56.788 --> 01:08:58.723
I didn't travel this far
to get back to my wife

01:08:58.725 --> 01:09:01.024
and my kid to
not get home now.

01:09:01.026 --> 01:09:02.792
Now if getting down
there finding out

01:09:02.794 --> 01:09:04.627
what's going on is going
to help us all get home,

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:06.564
then I'm gonna help you.
I have your six, man.

01:09:06.566 --> 01:09:07.997
I appreciate that.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.466
But I'm doing
my job right now

01:09:09.468 --> 01:09:11.469
and I'm going down alone!

01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:13.837
Dani, you stay here.

01:09:13.839 --> 01:09:16.140
I'm gonna go with the marshal.

01:09:16.142 --> 01:09:17.542
Nobody's coming with...

01:09:17.544 --> 01:09:20.447
Please stop!
Just follow me.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.729
(ghost screams)

01:09:37.731 --> 01:09:40.465
(grunts)

01:09:40.466 --> 01:09:41.966
You guys are gonna
have to be quick.

01:09:41.968 --> 01:09:43.533
I can't see anything
down there.

01:09:43.536 --> 01:09:45.435
That light won't
be strong enough.

01:09:45.438 --> 01:09:47.106
Hang tight.

01:09:48.508 --> 01:09:50.442
That one will.

01:09:50.444 --> 01:09:51.475
There we go.

01:09:51.477 --> 01:09:53.443
(baby crying)

01:09:53.444 --> 01:09:54.679
What is that?

01:09:54.681 --> 01:09:57.584
Sounds like a baby.

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:10.060
Oh!

01:10:10.062 --> 01:10:11.729
Guys, what is happening?

01:10:11.731 --> 01:10:14.767
Sorry! I thought I saw
something, but it's gone.

01:10:15.502 --> 01:10:17.502
This is a nightmare.

01:10:17.504 --> 01:10:18.802
Oh!

01:10:18.804 --> 01:10:20.572
- You okay?
- You okay?

01:10:20.574 --> 01:10:22.810
(screams)

01:10:26.512 --> 01:10:27.947
This is bad.

01:10:30.484 --> 01:10:32.919
(screams)

01:10:41.861 --> 01:10:43.996
Oh...

01:10:51.670 --> 01:10:53.438
It's leading to that bag.

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.605
Austin, do you want
to grab that?

01:10:54.607 --> 01:10:57.143
Yeah, sure.

01:11:02.348 --> 01:11:03.950
Guys?

01:11:04.718 --> 01:11:06.551
What are they?

01:11:06.553 --> 01:11:08.185
- Her!
- Who?

01:11:08.187 --> 01:11:11.122
The overhead bin!
In the overhead bin!

01:11:11.124 --> 01:11:13.527
That's blood.

01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:19.662
Souvenirs.

01:11:19.664 --> 01:11:21.465
Typical serial killer.

01:11:21.467 --> 01:11:23.435
Holy shit!

01:11:23.437 --> 01:11:26.337
What, what?

01:11:26.339 --> 01:11:27.639
It would be her.

01:11:27.641 --> 01:11:29.440
Are they all here?

01:11:29.442 --> 01:11:31.911
Where's the woman that ran
towards us and disappeared?

01:11:33.045 --> 01:11:35.512
Holy Mary Mother of God,
that's her.

01:11:35.514 --> 01:11:36.747
There.

01:11:36.749 --> 01:11:38.748
This bag belongs
to someone on the plane?

01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:42.185
A killer?
Whose bag is this?

01:11:42.187 --> 01:11:44.156
- That's easy to figure out.
- Find out.

01:11:50.664 --> 01:11:52.633
No way.

01:12:35.409 --> 01:12:37.244
(beeping)

01:12:39.212 --> 01:12:41.211
Captain, I'm gonna have
to speak with you

01:12:41.213 --> 01:12:42.613
about what's been
going on tonight.

01:12:42.615 --> 01:12:44.180
(chuckles)

01:12:44.182 --> 01:12:46.984
No disrespect, Marshal.
But can we do this another time?

01:12:46.986 --> 01:12:48.685
I don't know
if you've noticed,

01:12:48.687 --> 01:12:50.387
but I'm flying this
plane by myself

01:12:50.389 --> 01:12:52.256
and we haven't really been
having a great night.

01:12:52.258 --> 01:12:56.661
You sure you wanna
do this right here?

01:12:56.663 --> 01:12:57.929
Do what?

01:12:57.931 --> 01:13:01.099
Talk about the women
you've murdered.

01:13:01.101 --> 01:13:02.966
Murdered?

01:13:02.968 --> 01:13:04.702
(laughs)

01:13:04.704 --> 01:13:07.204
Murdered?
You serious?

01:13:07.206 --> 01:13:08.739
Cut the bullshit!

01:13:08.741 --> 01:13:10.408
Whoa!
You can't talk to me like that!

01:13:10.410 --> 01:13:13.077
Look, Marshal, whatever
you think's going on,

01:13:13.079 --> 01:13:15.578
we can't have this many
people in the cockpit.

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:16.948
I'm sure you know protocol.

01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:18.683
I'm afraid I'm not
gonna be able

01:13:18.685 --> 01:13:20.717
to follow protocol
right now, Captain.

01:13:20.719 --> 01:13:22.153
Neither are they.

01:13:22.155 --> 01:13:26.357
What is this?
We're almost on the ground.

01:13:26.359 --> 01:13:28.525
Whatever it is can wait
till we're on the ground.

01:13:28.527 --> 01:13:29.859
No, it can't wait.

01:13:29.861 --> 01:13:31.528
We're talking about
this right now!

01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:34.064
Where did you get these?
What did you do to her?

01:13:34.066 --> 01:13:36.667
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:13:36.669 --> 01:13:38.168
What is this?

01:13:38.170 --> 01:13:39.670
Good God!
What's wrong with you people?

01:13:39.672 --> 01:13:41.171
I don't know who this woman is.

01:13:41.173 --> 01:13:42.741
Don't lie to me!
What did you do to her?

01:13:42.743 --> 01:13:44.875
What did you do to her baby?

01:13:44.877 --> 01:13:46.476
It's funny how the women
in these photographs

01:13:46.478 --> 01:13:47.810
were the same women
causing all the problems

01:13:47.812 --> 01:13:49.480
on this plane tonight.

01:13:49.482 --> 01:13:52.984
Also very funny how all the
pictures ended up in your bag.

01:13:52.986 --> 01:13:54.254
Jack....

01:13:55.021 --> 01:13:56.420
Captain.

01:13:56.422 --> 01:14:00.724
I don't... look, these
aren't my... oh, come on!

01:14:00.726 --> 01:14:03.760
Tell the truth!

01:14:03.762 --> 01:14:06.667
Captain?

01:14:11.905 --> 01:14:16.309
(screaming)

01:14:19.212 --> 01:14:21.244
- Cut me loose!
- What?

01:14:21.246 --> 01:14:22.846
Don't do it!

01:14:22.848 --> 01:14:23.881
We need somebody to fly
the plane, please!

01:14:23.883 --> 01:14:26.386
Cut me loose!

01:14:29.755 --> 01:14:31.087
Trust me!

01:14:31.089 --> 01:14:33.558
Without a pilot,
we're gonna die!

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:36.092
Hurry!

01:14:36.094 --> 01:14:38.397
Revenge!

01:14:42.735 --> 01:14:45.105
Revenge!

01:14:46.472 --> 01:14:47.973
Hurry!

01:14:50.743 --> 01:14:53.110
Please!

01:14:53.112 --> 01:14:55.347
Hurry!

01:14:59.584 --> 01:15:02.054
Revenge!

01:15:07.794 --> 01:15:11.031
Revenge!

01:15:21.106 --> 01:15:23.442
Revenge!

01:15:28.781 --> 01:15:30.784
Move!

01:15:34.053 --> 01:15:38.989
Revenge!
Revenge!

01:15:38.991 --> 01:15:42.795
Murderer!
Revenge!

01:15:56.810 --> 01:15:58.210
You know who I am?

01:15:58.812 --> 01:16:01.310
(screaming)

01:16:01.312 --> 01:16:04.484
Get your hands off me!
Christ!

01:16:17.797 --> 01:16:20.598
Dani? Baby?

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.102
Hey...

01:16:29.941 --> 01:16:31.544
Come on...

01:16:32.512 --> 01:16:33.980
Come on.

01:16:35.882 --> 01:16:38.084
What happened?

01:16:47.959 --> 01:16:49.092
I didn't...

01:16:49.094 --> 01:16:51.932
I didn't do it, I swear.

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:55.835
Save it.

01:17:17.923 --> 01:17:19.422
What did you do?

01:17:19.424 --> 01:17:21.158
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:23.529
Let's get her
to her chair.

01:17:25.297 --> 01:17:27.997
- Can you...
- Yeah, I got her.

01:17:27.999 --> 01:17:31.368
I got you.
Come on, babe.

01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:33.069
Hey, hey.

01:17:33.071 --> 01:17:34.337
Tell me what you did!

01:17:34.339 --> 01:17:36.442
I didn't do anything!

01:17:40.079 --> 01:17:41.511
You tell me what
you did right now

01:17:41.513 --> 01:17:43.346
or I will end you
where you sit.

01:17:43.348 --> 01:17:46.951
Look, nothing
I did matters, okay?

01:17:46.953 --> 01:17:48.086
Austin!

01:17:48.088 --> 01:17:49.385
Okay?
None of it matters.

01:17:49.387 --> 01:17:51.020
You're gonna get
everyone killed!

01:17:51.022 --> 01:17:53.224
Wake up, honey,
come on, babe?

01:17:53.226 --> 01:17:53.991
Come on.

01:17:53.993 --> 01:17:56.996
No, not everyone.

01:17:58.798 --> 01:18:00.467
Just you.

01:18:07.039 --> 01:18:09.942
(screaming)

01:18:16.782 --> 01:18:18.651
(baby cries)

01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:25.292
Oh, my God.

01:18:28.928 --> 01:18:31.261
No!

01:18:31.263 --> 01:18:32.965
No!

01:18:38.137 --> 01:18:41.942
Stop. Please stop.

01:18:47.045 --> 01:18:48.679
No, no, no, no!

01:18:48.681 --> 01:18:50.314
It's not my fault!
It's not my fault!

01:18:50.316 --> 01:18:51.982
I didn't mean it the first time!

01:18:51.984 --> 01:18:53.317
It was an accident!

01:18:53.319 --> 01:18:55.152
She liked it rough, you know.

01:18:55.154 --> 01:18:56.987
I did too,
so I thought it was okay!

01:18:56.989 --> 01:18:59.323
We were role-playing!

01:18:59.325 --> 01:19:02.726
And I guess I just got
a little too into it!

01:19:02.728 --> 01:19:04.228
I was scared the first time!

01:19:04.230 --> 01:19:08.131
I felt guilty,
but deep down inside.

01:19:08.133 --> 01:19:09.367
I liked it.
I loved it.

01:19:09.369 --> 01:19:12.235
I loved watching
the expiration light

01:19:12.237 --> 01:19:14.572
blink and then fade.

01:19:14.574 --> 01:19:16.573
It became an urge.
A need.

01:19:16.575 --> 01:19:19.076
Then it became me.

01:19:19.078 --> 01:19:20.210
I realized I could
just fly away

01:19:20.212 --> 01:19:21.711
and no one would know.

01:19:21.713 --> 01:19:23.547
And I didn't know how to stop!
I just...

01:19:23.549 --> 01:19:27.018
Oh God, I'm so sorry, please!

01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:29.188
I'm so sorry! I just...

01:19:30.222 --> 01:19:34.424
I don't know how to stop it!

01:19:34.426 --> 01:19:38.095
Forgive me.
Please forgive me.

01:19:38.097 --> 01:19:39.564
I'll do anything.

01:19:39.566 --> 01:19:41.398
(baby cries)

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:44.571
No!

01:19:53.111 --> 01:19:55.481
No!

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:12.031
Brandon!

01:20:18.437 --> 01:20:20.073
No!

01:20:42.527 --> 01:20:43.993
Come here!

01:20:43.995 --> 01:20:45.162
No!

01:20:45.164 --> 01:20:47.930
This is all your fault!

01:20:47.932 --> 01:20:50.134
(shouts)

01:20:50.136 --> 01:20:51.635
Bitch!

01:20:51.637 --> 01:20:53.806
(ghosts screaming)

01:20:59.111 --> 01:21:02.315
(baby cries)

01:21:09.888 --> 01:21:11.356
Don't...

01:21:17.230 --> 01:21:19.531
(screaming)

01:21:43.021 --> 01:21:44.490
No!

01:21:52.197 --> 01:21:54.265
No!

01:21:54.267 --> 01:21:56.169
No!
(gunshot)

01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:16.119
(gasps)

01:22:16.121 --> 01:22:17.220
No, no!

01:22:17.222 --> 01:22:19.558
(screaming)

01:22:30.236 --> 01:22:33.069
Everybody, please hang on!

01:22:33.071 --> 01:22:35.607
(screaming)

01:22:50.722 --> 01:22:54.257
JFK Center, PAN-US 57!
Do you copy?

01:22:54.259 --> 01:22:55.928
Damn it!

01:23:03.636 --> 01:23:07.570
(screams)

01:23:07.572 --> 01:23:09.542
Hang on!

01:23:13.146 --> 01:23:15.915
(screaming)

01:23:19.752 --> 01:23:23.423
Brace!
Brace, brace, brace!

01:23:27.727 --> 01:23:29.729
(screaming)

01:23:30.762 --> 01:23:33.029
- Brandon!
- I got you!

01:23:33.031 --> 01:23:34.633
I got you!

01:23:44.611 --> 01:23:46.412
Shit.

01:23:48.146 --> 01:23:51.583
We're coming in hot!
Hold on!

01:23:55.654 --> 01:23:59.288
Come on, baby,
come on, come on!

01:23:59.290 --> 01:24:00.824
Come on, come on.

01:24:00.826 --> 01:24:03.359
Got this...

01:24:03.361 --> 01:24:05.632
Everyone brace for impact!

01:24:25.450 --> 01:24:28.020
(screaming)

01:24:41.133 --> 01:24:43.970
(gasps)

01:24:45.538 --> 01:24:48.805
Are you okay?
You okay?

01:24:48.807 --> 01:24:50.877
(sirens blaring)

01:24:52.111 --> 01:24:54.647
(laughs)

01:25:00.085 --> 01:25:01.721
You okay?

01:25:11.096 --> 01:25:13.799
We're good back here.

01:25:14.767 --> 01:25:16.736
Oh my God.

01:25:20.606 --> 01:25:23.607
It's okay, it's okay.

01:25:23.609 --> 01:25:27.210
Hey, hey, it's okay.
I got you.

01:25:27.212 --> 01:25:28.714
I got you.

01:25:29.749 --> 01:25:31.415
Ryan?

01:25:31.417 --> 01:25:34.419
Ryan, okay.

01:25:35.721 --> 01:25:37.623
(laughs)
