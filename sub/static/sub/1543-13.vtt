00:04.171 --> 00:06.151
Who are you, cops?

00:11.812 --> 00:14.349
- You guys are X-Files.
- Sure, yeah. You could say that.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.887
Cain still has the Mark, right'?
So he's lived with it for years.

00:18.085 --> 00:21.532
The Mark is strong.
Maybe you have to fight that.

00:21.922 --> 00:24.562
Dean. How do you think
angry spirits are born?

00:24.758 --> 00:27.068
They can't let go and they can't move on.

00:29.863 --> 00:33.367
Like wounded animals.
Lost, in so much pain they lash out.

00:33.567 --> 00:34.739
Why? Why are they here?

00:34.935 --> 00:37.745
Well, there's some part of them
that's keeping them here.

00:37.938 --> 00:39.440
Some spirits held on too tight.

00:42.109 --> 00:45.249
- Dean, you haven't left the bunker in a week.
- And?

00:45.445 --> 00:48.426
You can't just live the rest of your life
locked up in this room.

00:48.615 --> 00:51.186
- I know you're worried about the Mark.
- Yes, Sam, I am.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.389
Do I wish the Mark was gone?
Yes, of course. Absolutely I do.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.263
We'll figure it out.

00:57.457 --> 00:58.959
We always do.

01:00.093 --> 01:01.970
Damn right.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.653
You sure you're okay to drive?

01:23.450 --> 01:25.054
Not really.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.755
But it's nothing a little grease can't fix.

01:27.955 --> 01:30.195
- Trini, find me the nearest Taco Town.
- Searching.

01:30.390 --> 01:32.961
I'm gonna get a Quesarito
and a Chi-Chi Melt.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.766
Turn right in 50 feet.

01:41.969 --> 01:45.075
Um, Billy, I don't think this is the way
to Taco Town.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.650
What do you know? Your phone's 3G.

01:49.176 --> 01:51.247
Trini doesn't make mistakes.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.915
Continue for point-three miles.
Then turn left.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.632
It's freezing.
Can you please turn off the air?

02:07.828 --> 02:09.033
It's not on.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.212
What the hell?

02:18.205 --> 02:20.845
Trini doesn't make mistakes, huh?

02:22.175 --> 02:23.779
Trini, find a different route.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.718
Proceed ahead.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.515
Go screw yourself.

02:27.714 --> 02:30.217
You go screw yourself.

02:31.051 --> 02:34.362
Janet, get out of the truck.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.335
Um, how does she know my name?

02:38.558 --> 02:40.469
Janet. Get out of the truck!

02:40.661 --> 02:42.072
Now!

02:42.529 --> 02:44.008
Oh, my God.

02:48.735 --> 02:49.873
No!

02:52.072 --> 02:53.551
No, wait! Stop!

02:56.677 --> 02:58.554
No! Stop!

02:58.745 --> 03:00.884
No!

03:01.081 --> 03:03.061
- Billy!
"Slop!

03:03.250 --> 03:05.594
Destination dead ahead.

03:19.266 --> 03:22.110
- Hey.
- What in the world?

03:22.369 --> 03:24.576
- A Croissookie.
- A Croissookie?

03:24.771 --> 03:28.378
- Mm-hm. Yeah, they're the new Cronuts.
- Okay, so, what, half-cookie, half...?

03:28.909 --> 03:31.082
Who gives a crap?
They're frigging awesome.

03:31.278 --> 03:32.518
What did Cass say?

03:32.713 --> 03:34.056
Uh, good news, bad news.

03:34.247 --> 03:37.751
Bad news,
he discovered riverboat gambling.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.397
Good news, he thinks
he might be closing in on Cain.

03:40.954 --> 03:43.525
- Oh, wow. Thinks he might be?
- Yeah.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.102
Just east of the Mississippi.
Somewhere in Illinois.

03:46.293 --> 03:49.763
So maybe Cass finds Cain
in the Land of Lincoln...

03:49.963 --> 03:50.963
...and then what?

03:51.131 --> 03:53.634
Then we get him to tell us
how to get rid of the Mark.

03:55.936 --> 03:59.281
Don't you think if Cain knew how to
remove the Mark, he would've done it?

03:59.473 --> 04:02.044
- Like centuries ago?
- We won't know till we try.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.945
Sammy, I appreciate the effort, man, I do.

04:05.145 --> 04:09.890
But trying to find a cure for this thing,
it's like a dog chasing its tail.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.063
No end in sight and you just end up dizzy.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.233
- Dean, where there's a will...
- There is a case.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.833
Hmm? Check this out.

04:17.824 --> 04:20.964
"Iowa Teen Claims
Possessed Pickup Kills Driver."

04:22.496 --> 04:25.500
What say we take our own trek
to, uh, the Midwest?

04:46.353 --> 04:48.765
So crazy...

04:50.524 --> 04:54.097
Sorry I ever made you leave. Phew.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.507
God, they're everywhere.

04:58.698 --> 05:00.939
Ah. Which one of you is Janet?

05:01.134 --> 05:03.444
- I am.
- Agents Grohl and Cobain.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.177
I already talked to the police
like nine times.

05:07.374 --> 05:09.183
- This is, uh, just a follow-up.
- Yeah.

05:10.143 --> 05:14.182
- I have finals tomorrow.
- Then we'll make it fast. Promise.

05:18.451 --> 05:20.192
It's like I told the detective.

05:20.387 --> 05:23.163
I was drunk, but I wasn't hallucinating.

05:23.356 --> 05:25.802
- The truck had a mind of its own.
- How so?

05:26.393 --> 05:29.533
Like, the air went full blast,
even though it wasn't on...

05:29.729 --> 05:32.073
...and the radio went crazy...

05:33.233 --> 05:34.735
...and so did Trini.

05:35.235 --> 05:36.339
And Trini is...?

05:37.737 --> 05:41.549
Excuse my partner. When it comes
to technology, he's a little behind.

05:41.741 --> 05:42.879
Uh...

05:43.076 --> 05:45.579
He just learned how to poke
on Facebook.

05:47.013 --> 05:50.859
Uh... Um, Trini is the
nav app we were using.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.554
It... It's like a talking map.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.566
You're Gen X, right?

05:58.692 --> 06:02.731
Okay, so Trini and everything else
in the truck went all Christine?

06:03.263 --> 06:04.333
Who's Christine?

06:08.101 --> 06:10.342
It's a Gen X thing.

06:11.271 --> 06:15.014
Look, I don't expect you to believe me...

06:15.208 --> 06:18.746
...but I swear that truck
was hell-bent on killing Billy.

06:18.945 --> 06:20.424
Did Billy have any enemies?

06:20.614 --> 06:24.391
- Anybody who might've had a beef with him?
- Maybe his brother, Joey?

06:24.584 --> 06:26.257
They fought all the time.

06:27.254 --> 06:30.258
It's so sad. They never
got to set it right.

06:30.457 --> 06:31.936
Because Billy died?

06:32.125 --> 06:36.130
No. Joey did. In Afghanistan.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.602
Do you know where he's buried?

06:39.799 --> 06:43.770
He's not. Poor guy never came home. IED.

06:43.970 --> 06:48.112
Did Billy happen to have anything
of his brother's on him when he died? Uh...

06:48.308 --> 06:50.481
Dog tags, a hat, something?

06:51.278 --> 06:52.552
Just his pickup.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.750
- So the truck belonged to Joey?
- Yeah.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.622
It was his pride and joy.

06:57.817 --> 07:01.128
Billy got it when he died.
And, you know, it's a thing.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.459
Yeah.

07:03.823 --> 07:05.496
Excuse me a sec.

07:05.825 --> 07:08.271
So...? So, what's a "thing"?

07:08.795 --> 07:10.468
You know, the truck thing.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.770
You honor the deceased
by driving their truck.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.846
Sam, they wrote
a whole country song about it.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.447
Why don't you Google it?

07:27.113 --> 07:31.584
All right. So we're looking for something
that used to resemble a pickup truck.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.321
All right.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.498
Hey.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.333
Here we go.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.103
Yeah, Marine.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.644
I'm guessing this ain't oil.

07:53.373 --> 07:56.013
- That is ectoplasm.
- Huh.

07:56.443 --> 07:58.150
Look at this.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.390
- Joey?
- Looks like.

08:01.881 --> 08:02.882
- Yeah.
- All right.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.528
So big brother didn't get along
with little brother.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.630
Was pissed that he was driving his baby.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.495
- I get it.
- What, are you saying, uh...

08:10.690 --> 08:13.500
...if you died and I drove your car,
you'd kill me?

08:14.527 --> 08:18.475
If you stunk her up with taquitos?
Probably.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.405
All right, let's do this.

08:58.505 --> 09:01.679
...Makes it look like
a pool in Reseda.

09:01.941 --> 09:05.081
Ugh. I can't believe
our Art of History final's tomorrow.

09:05.278 --> 09:08.452
I know. This semester,
like, totally flew by.

09:08.681 --> 09:10.752
Yeah. Time flies when you're drunk.

09:13.453 --> 09:17.094
Wanna come to the library with me?
I still have so much to memorize.

09:17.290 --> 09:20.134
I thought looking at pictures
of naked guys was gonna be easy.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.966
Thanks, but I don't really need
to study for it.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.802
I have a photographic memory.
Hashtag "blessed."

09:26.032 --> 09:28.911
Um, you don't need to study for it
because you're screwing the TA.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.480
- Hashtag "slut."
- Ha.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.094
- Hey.
- I'm not gonna make it.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.131
Focus.

12:15.535 --> 12:16.639
Delilah Marian.

12:16.869 --> 12:20.407
The roommate found her this morning
after an all-nighter at the library.

12:20.607 --> 12:21.984
Strangulation?

12:22.208 --> 12:25.280
Sicko used the power cord
from the computer.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.788
Suspects'?
- None yet.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.257
The odd thing was the door was locked.

12:30.450 --> 12:34.057
Hmm. Have you talked to any of
the other girls who live here?

12:34.254 --> 12:35.961
Most of them left for spring break.

12:36.155 --> 12:39.159
But the roommate was helpful.
Gave us all of Julie's passwords.

12:39.392 --> 12:43.465
Nowadays, the only way to find out anything
about teenagers is through social media.

12:43.663 --> 12:45.108
Trust me. I got two of them.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.443
- Excuse me, agents.
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

12:51.004 --> 12:54.816
- Vengeful spirit much?
- Yeah, but is it Joey's, or another ghost?

12:55.008 --> 12:56.612
I don't know.

12:58.845 --> 13:01.849
So first it possesses a truck,
and then it possesses a computer?

13:04.350 --> 13:06.330
Both machine-related kills.

13:07.153 --> 13:09.827
You think we're dealing
with a ghost in the machine?

13:10.023 --> 13:11.434
Maybe.

13:11.624 --> 13:15.834
But if it is the same ghost, I mean, they usually
anchor themselves to a place or a thing.

13:16.029 --> 13:19.670
How is this one jumping
from one machine to the next?

13:22.635 --> 13:26.208
We really appreciate your help, Delilah.
We know this can't be easy.

13:27.273 --> 13:31.949
Did Julie, by chance,
know a student named Billy Bass'?

13:32.145 --> 13:35.354
Everyone knew Billy.
He was the president of Sigma Theta Delta.

13:36.282 --> 13:37.317
STD?

13:38.451 --> 13:39.828
Yeah.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.555
It's the biggest frat on campus.

13:44.724 --> 13:48.672
Did, uh, Julie know Billy's brother Joey?
The... The soldier.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.875
I don't think so.
I didn't even know Billy had a brother.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.474
Did she have any enemies?

13:55.668 --> 13:57.909
Any reason why someone
might wanna hurt her?

14:00.573 --> 14:01.881
No.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.649
Julie was really popular. Super sweet.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.654
I can't imagine anyone wanting to hurt her.

14:09.148 --> 14:13.392
You know we're federal agents, right?
Lying to us is a big-time offense.

14:15.154 --> 14:17.395
I'm not lying, agent.

14:17.590 --> 14:21.504
There's just nothing else to tell.

14:25.832 --> 14:27.368
There you go.

14:29.535 --> 14:30.878
Hi.

14:35.441 --> 14:36.886
All right. Ahem.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.851
A café au lait for the lady.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.422
- And for me...
- A heart attack?

14:40.613 --> 14:44.720
Heh. This is unreal. Look at this.
I got Italian, I got Chinese.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.460
Serve-yourself fro-yo.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.030
College is better than Vegas.

14:50.890 --> 14:54.929
- What do you got?
Unfortunately, a lot of nada. I...

14:57.797 --> 15:02.712
I hit up Julie's Facebook, Instagram,
Twitter, InstaChat, Snapchat, AIM.

15:02.902 --> 15:06.042
Nothing but posts on rush
and Fifty Shades of Grey.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.048
The movie, not the book.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.841
- Yeah, I didn't get half of that.
- Heh.

15:09.976 --> 15:11.148
Doesn't matter.

15:11.377 --> 15:13.880
Now I'm going through her deleted files.

15:15.281 --> 15:17.887
- You can do that?
- Yeah.

15:18.584 --> 15:19.756
Hmm.

15:19.952 --> 15:22.330
Nothing ever really gets deleted
from the Internet.

15:26.959 --> 15:28.165
You knew that, right?

15:28.661 --> 15:30.163
Yeah.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.911
All right.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.574
Here we go.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.148
This might be something.

15:40.339 --> 15:45.311
It's a deleted InstaChat from last night,
right around time of death.

15:45.511 --> 15:49.789
- With who?
- With "PrincessElsa8."

15:49.982 --> 15:51.427
Look at this.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.496
"Liar." "I know." "You'll pay."

15:55.254 --> 15:57.495
This PrincessElsa's a bitch.

15:57.690 --> 16:01.365
- What's "810"?
- Eight-ten? Uh...

16:01.594 --> 16:03.005
Eight-ten.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.767
I don't know. Maybe it's a date.

16:05.965 --> 16:09.105
Maybe it's a time of day. Or an area code.

16:11.204 --> 16:14.208
Uh, area code is for Southeast Michigan.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.845
You know what?

16:18.511 --> 16:19.683
Here we go.

16:19.879 --> 16:23.884
There are three addresses in Spencer
that have 810 in them.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.894
I'll see if I can get this to go.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.366
Yeah. You got it.
Thank you, Detective Petranzyk.

16:36.562 --> 16:38.371
We will keep in touch.

16:39.832 --> 16:44.542
So PrincessElsa8
is not some crazed cyber-killer.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.581
She's a third grader
from Lake Nebagamon, Wisconsin...

16:47.807 --> 16:49.218
...who's obsessed with Frozen.

16:49.809 --> 16:52.187
And she was fast asleep
when the InstaChat occurred.

16:52.378 --> 16:53.880
So a hack job?

16:54.080 --> 16:55.855
That's what I'm thinking.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.218
Huh.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.806
Excuse me, ma'am.

17:45.798 --> 17:48.608
May we, uh, ask what you're doing?

17:48.801 --> 17:51.611
Um, throwing away dead flowers.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.442
Is that a crime?

17:53.639 --> 17:58.588
No, it's not a crime. It's just a little
strange seeing as how they aren't dead.

17:58.778 --> 18:03.227
Ah. It's not so strange
when it feels like they're taunting you.

18:04.884 --> 18:07.728
My husband was killed in a car
accident here nine months ago.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.990
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Our condolences.

18:11.223 --> 18:12.224
Thank you.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.234
We were newlyweds.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.930
Never even made it to
our first anniversary.

18:17.129 --> 18:21.305
And to have to be reminded of that
every time I look out my window...

18:21.500 --> 18:23.446
...or leave the house...

18:24.236 --> 18:25.271
Understandable.

18:25.972 --> 18:30.580
Forgive me,
but did you notice anything weird...

18:30.776 --> 18:32.153
...after your husband's death?

18:32.345 --> 18:36.259
- Any strange disturbances, or...?
- I'm not sure what you mean.

18:38.351 --> 18:39.853
It's nothing. Never mind.

18:40.987 --> 18:43.490
Any idea who's leaving the flowers?

18:43.689 --> 18:44.759
Some teenage girl.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.370
I think she goes to the college,
because she's always in Greek letters.

18:48.594 --> 18:50.198
- Do you know her name?
- No.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.538
Uh, but she has long red hair.

18:55.334 --> 18:56.574
This is Agent Grohl again.

18:56.702 --> 19:00.047
I know I told you to call at your earliest
convenience, but scratch that.

19:00.272 --> 19:02.047
Call ASAP.

19:05.277 --> 19:08.986
Look at this. "Andrew Silver,
29-year-old Spencer High School teacher...

19:09.181 --> 19:10.888
...killed in a fatal accident.

19:11.450 --> 19:16.058
Uh, the car burst into flames, Silver's
body was burned beyond recognition...

19:16.288 --> 19:19.462
...and he is believed
to have been killed upon impact."

19:23.229 --> 19:27.837
Okay, so Andy the Angry Ghost,
he dies at 810 Downs Drive.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.042
Then he torments Julie
with "810" on her computer.

19:31.237 --> 19:33.148
So, what's his beef with her?

19:33.339 --> 19:35.410
Yeah, and what's his connection to Billy?

19:35.641 --> 19:37.643
Does it say where he's buried?

19:37.843 --> 19:39.720
He wasn't. He was cremated.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.984
So no bones, and he's not tethered
to any object that we know of.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.356
Yeah.
How is Andrew haunting his victims?

19:49.088 --> 19:50.499
Are you gonna eat all that?

19:51.924 --> 19:53.267
Yeah. You want some?

19:55.194 --> 19:57.196
The feds called.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.202
Like three times already.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.010
Kyle, are you listening to me?

20:04.537 --> 20:06.278
I think they know.

20:08.107 --> 20:09.780
Maybe it's time we should come clean.

20:10.009 --> 20:13.582
- Uh, that's not gonna happen.
- Look where keeping our mouths shut got us.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.755
I think it's karma.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.361
Maybe we're being cursed or something.
I don't know.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.963
First Billy, now Julie?

20:21.187 --> 20:25.397
Look, it totally sucks
that Billy and Julie died.

20:25.591 --> 20:28.401
But it's just a crappy coincidence,
not a curse.

20:28.594 --> 20:30.471
If we don't do something, I'm worried...

20:30.696 --> 20:33.870
Delilah, stop. I'm serious.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.306
Keep your mouth shut...

20:35.534 --> 20:38.708
...or you're gonna have a lot more
than a curse to worry about.

20:59.325 --> 21:00.395
Hells yeah.

21:06.165 --> 21:07.508
Where are you?

21:20.279 --> 21:21.587
Was that you?

21:21.781 --> 21:23.317
No.

21:25.184 --> 21:26.595
What a tease.

21:33.325 --> 21:34.429
Hello'?

21:34.627 --> 21:36.300
What time is it?

21:49.441 --> 21:51.148
Who the hell is this?

22:01.220 --> 22:02.961
Lower the tunes, bro.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.190
I'm trying to study.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.189
Are you okay?

22:26.378 --> 22:27.755
Not really.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.718
- Hey.
- What do you got?

22:31.917 --> 22:34.022
- Death by decibel.
- What'?

22:34.220 --> 22:36.427
Kyle's brains were jellied by his speakers.

22:36.655 --> 22:39.329
And get this, the, uh, clock on his stereo
stopped at 8:10.

22:39.925 --> 22:42.929
- 8:10? Again.
- Yeah. Mm-hm.

22:45.231 --> 22:47.177
We know you're the one
leaving the flowers.

22:47.366 --> 22:51.337
Why don't you just tell us what happened
the night of Andrew Silver's accident?

22:52.271 --> 22:53.841
Delilah, please.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.746
This is the third death in five days.

22:55.941 --> 22:57.921
Who knows who's gonna be next?

22:59.612 --> 23:00.750
I am.

23:01.747 --> 23:06.196
The car accident wasn't
exactly an accident.

23:16.128 --> 23:19.371
- Dude, I just retweeted your tweet.
- Dude, I just favorited yours.

23:19.565 --> 23:22.307
Heh. Okay, here. Selfie.

23:24.603 --> 23:28.949
- Let's see.
- OMG, I'm such a hag.

23:29.141 --> 23:30.745
- I look like I'm 25.
- Ugh!

23:30.943 --> 23:32.422
That's what filters are for.

23:32.611 --> 23:34.284
Ugh. Ew. Delete.

23:35.981 --> 23:37.756
- Check this. Wait.
- Okay, wait.

23:37.950 --> 23:40.550
- I'm sending it to you, dude. Here.
- Let's do one more.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.905
Oh, my God, Billy. Call 911.

23:57.169 --> 23:59.843
Call... Call 911.

24:07.513 --> 24:08.685
No. No.

24:16.622 --> 24:19.967
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting out of here before the cops come.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.696
We just killed that guy.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.766
You're not calling the cops.

24:27.866 --> 24:32.440
I already have a DUI and if they find out
I'm driving on a suspended license...

24:32.638 --> 24:33.673
...I'm going to jail.

24:33.872 --> 24:35.852
Come on, Billy. This isn't right.

24:36.041 --> 24:37.645
Help me out here, guys.

24:41.447 --> 24:43.017
It's not our problem, Dee.

24:43.682 --> 24:46.356
- What?
Someone else will call the cops.

24:46.552 --> 24:49.158
Not a word. You hear me?

24:51.690 --> 24:55.069
I shouldn't have let them talk
me out of it. It was wrong.

24:57.363 --> 24:58.967
And now we're being punished.

24:59.164 --> 25:03.544
Seriously, what are the chances that three
out of the four of us die in one week?

25:03.736 --> 25:06.216
It can't be a coincidence.

25:06.405 --> 25:07.679
It's not a coincidence.

25:07.873 --> 25:08.874
It's a ghost.

25:09.074 --> 25:11.884
The vengeful spirit of Andrew Silver.

25:12.077 --> 25:13.078
A Ghost?

25:13.312 --> 25:14.882
Yeah, they're real.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.219
Yeah. They're sort of what we do.

25:17.416 --> 25:22.866
- So you're like ghostbusters?
- Sure. First things first though.

25:23.055 --> 25:28.505
You need to stay inside the salt circle,
while we take care of him, okay?

25:29.094 --> 25:31.074
How do you take care of him?

25:33.365 --> 25:35.538
Please tell me
you know how to take care of him.

25:35.734 --> 25:37.907
Usually a ghost is tied
to a place or an object.

25:38.103 --> 25:40.242
Get rid of the object,
you get rid of the ghost.

25:40.439 --> 25:43.943
But with Andrew, it's, uh, different.

25:44.576 --> 25:45.611
What's he tied to?

25:47.746 --> 25:48.781
We're working on it.

25:49.014 --> 25:53.793
But if we can figure out how he's traveling,
we can figure out how to stop him.

25:54.019 --> 25:57.125
Might be a Shocker situation.
Paper said he died from the collision.

25:57.356 --> 26:01.065
But Delilah says he died from electrocution.
So maybe that's how he's surfing.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.297
He's using the power lines as a conduit.

26:04.463 --> 26:07.273
That would make sense with the computer,
but not the pick-up.

26:07.466 --> 26:10.037
I mean, the truck runs on gas.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.578
It's gotta be something else.

26:12.971 --> 26:16.384
I'll go back to the accident site,
check it out. Stay here with her.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.568
Thanks.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.813
You getting tired?

26:43.001 --> 26:45.345
No. I'm used to it.

26:45.971 --> 26:48.076
I stay up all night studying.

26:49.007 --> 26:50.782
Mostly to avoid the nightmares.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.847
My mom's thrilled with my GPA...

26:55.080 --> 26:57.356
...but I'm just...

26:58.283 --> 27:00.422
...miserable.

27:04.356 --> 27:07.303
I think about Andrew all the time.

27:08.861 --> 27:11.205
And I've never even met the guy.

27:47.132 --> 27:50.636
It's pretty crazy to obsess
about someone you've never met.

27:51.537 --> 27:52.572
It's not that crazy.

27:53.739 --> 27:55.912
Truth is, I can relate.

27:56.141 --> 27:57.415
Really?

27:59.411 --> 28:03.052
I have made more mistakes than I can count.

28:05.150 --> 28:07.721
Ones that haunt me day and night.

28:08.353 --> 28:11.425
So how do you deal?

28:11.657 --> 28:13.102
Whiskey.

28:14.593 --> 28:16.504
Denial.

28:21.166 --> 28:23.407
I do my best to make things right.

28:23.602 --> 28:25.275
Whatever that may be.

28:28.740 --> 28:32.779
For you, maybe it's coming clean.

28:34.279 --> 28:38.557
You know, finding a way
to ask for forgiveness.

28:38.750 --> 28:44.257
But not breaking the bank at your local
florist. I mean real forgiveness.

28:46.191 --> 28:48.933
You can't just bury stuff like this.

28:49.127 --> 28:51.129
You gotta deal with it.

29:00.772 --> 29:02.809
Hey. What do you got?

29:03.041 --> 29:07.820
Dean. Andrew's not using power lines
to move, he's using Wi-Fi.

29:08.046 --> 29:09.616
Come again?

29:09.815 --> 29:11.954
The wires that electrocuted Andrew...

29:12.150 --> 29:15.962
...they feed directly into a Wi-Fi tower
right across the street.

29:16.154 --> 29:18.760
- So even ghosts are online?
- Apparently.

29:18.957 --> 29:20.800
I mean, it'd explain the truck kill.

29:20.993 --> 29:23.769
Billy's cell must've been using
a local Wi-Fi signal.

29:23.962 --> 29:28.468
So, uh, Andrew's ghost must have just
hopped onto Trini, that nav app.

29:28.667 --> 29:30.647
And then Julie's death-by-computer...

29:30.836 --> 29:34.306
...Kyle's death-by-stereo
with the wireless speakers.

29:34.506 --> 29:38.147
I mean, ll makes sense, Dean. We're all
just a bunch of electrical impulses.

29:38.343 --> 29:41.950
So whenever Andrew died, his impulses
just transferred to another current.

29:42.147 --> 29:45.617
Get Delilah somewhere safe.
Turn off all the routers in that sorority.

29:45.817 --> 29:48.821
Oh, yeah, sure, Sammy,
we'll just kill the Internet.

29:49.021 --> 29:51.763
- Wait. Can we?
- Uh, no. No, not really.

29:51.957 --> 29:55.700
Nope. All right, so then how the hell are
we gonna deal with the Lawnmower Man?

29:57.796 --> 29:59.173
You know what? I have an idea.

29:59.364 --> 30:00.843
Do what I said. Stay safe.

30:01.033 --> 30:02.979
I'll call you back.

30:04.836 --> 30:06.645
You know where the routers are?

30:06.838 --> 30:08.215
I have no idea.

30:33.799 --> 30:36.712
- Is that gonna work?
- Worth a try.

30:43.408 --> 30:45.251
Turn off everything connected to Wi-Fi.

31:03.261 --> 31:04.740
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:04.930 --> 31:07.240
Uh, I'm sorry to bother you,
but I have an emergency...

31:07.432 --> 31:09.105
...and I really need your help.

31:09.334 --> 31:13.214
- Now, this is gonna sound strange...
- it's my husband, isn't it'!

31:15.774 --> 31:17.219
Come in.

31:21.279 --> 31:22.952
- Come on, let's go.
- Where?

31:23.749 --> 31:25.456
Someplace that doesn't have a signal.

31:27.452 --> 31:29.557
The basement.
The reception sucks down there.

31:31.189 --> 31:32.293
All right, go, go, go.

31:37.462 --> 31:39.203
Go, go, go. Run.

31:39.798 --> 31:41.300
Run.

31:52.644 --> 31:56.888
- I thought the salt didn't work.
- That was because of the Wi-Fi.

31:58.650 --> 31:59.958
There's no signal down here.

32:00.152 --> 32:02.496
There's no computers, no tablets,
no cell phones.

32:02.721 --> 32:03.995
So Andrew can't bypass it.

32:07.659 --> 32:09.229
At least I don't think he can.

32:16.401 --> 32:21.316
It wasn't too long after the accident
that Andrew started contacting me.

32:21.506 --> 32:22.678
Contacting you how?

32:23.842 --> 32:25.116
Online.

32:27.412 --> 32:29.483
At first I thought it was just a joke.

32:29.681 --> 32:33.026
That someone was playing a cruel prank
on the grieving widow.

32:33.251 --> 32:36.596
But Andrew knew things.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.496
Things that only he and I would know.

32:40.025 --> 32:43.700
Inside jokes, the code to our alarm...

32:43.929 --> 32:46.375
...my obsession with Lifetime movies.

32:50.035 --> 32:53.380
It was then that I knew
I had my husband back...

32:53.605 --> 32:55.346
...even if it was just online.

32:55.540 --> 33:00.182
Did you never think to ask him what he was?

33:00.378 --> 33:02.324
Come on, agent.

33:02.881 --> 33:05.361
I've read the books, I've seen the movies.

33:05.550 --> 33:11.364
I knew he was a ghost or something,
but I didn't care.

33:11.556 --> 33:13.558
He was my husband.

33:14.793 --> 33:17.399
And it was great.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.734
Romantic, even.

33:19.965 --> 33:22.206
He'd send me love notes.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.744
We'd stay up all night reminiscing.

33:25.971 --> 33:30.044
But then he started acting strange.

33:30.242 --> 33:32.222
What do you mean, strange?

33:32.410 --> 33:35.254
I don't know. He'd just disappear.

33:35.480 --> 33:36.481
Radio silence.

33:36.681 --> 33:41.221
And then, out of nowhere,
he'd start e-mailing again.

33:41.419 --> 33:43.558
But he was different.

33:43.755 --> 33:44.859
Focused.

33:45.056 --> 33:46.433
Focused on what?

33:49.928 --> 33:51.566
Revenge.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.908
When the kids at the
college started dying...

33:58.103 --> 34:00.606
...I thought it might be Andrew.

34:01.006 --> 34:03.953
But what was I supposed to do?

34:04.175 --> 34:08.282
Call the cops and tell them the ghost
of my dead husband was picking off co-eds?

34:11.116 --> 34:14.097
But mostly...

34:15.286 --> 34:18.598
...I just didn't want to face the truth.

34:20.292 --> 34:24.763
Because I knew it was revenge
that brought him back.

34:24.963 --> 34:30.469
And if I tried to stop him
that he might go away.

34:32.804 --> 34:35.614
And I didn't want to lose my husband again.

34:44.716 --> 34:46.559
Just try to stay calm, all right?

34:50.822 --> 34:53.166
- What was that?
- I don't know.

35:14.512 --> 35:16.992
Please don't kill me.
We didn't mean to hurt you.

35:17.182 --> 35:18.991
It was an accident. I swear.

35:19.184 --> 35:22.358
If I could do it over again,
I would've done the right thing.

35:27.692 --> 35:29.330
- Let's go.
- Where?

35:29.527 --> 35:31.336
The door.

35:31.529 --> 35:32.667
It's locked.

35:36.434 --> 35:38.209
Andrew, listen to me.

35:39.604 --> 35:41.208
You have every right to be pissed.

35:43.375 --> 35:46.481
But take it from me,
the more you kill, the crazier you'll get.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.988
The blood fuels the rage.

35:57.055 --> 35:59.865
So it looks like to me you got two choices.

36:00.058 --> 36:02.060
You can keep killing...

36:02.961 --> 36:06.204
...and become something
that you won't recognize...

36:06.398 --> 36:08.309
...or you can move on.

36:09.300 --> 36:12.304
Because that is the only thing
that is gonna give you peace.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.575
So it's up you, man.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.013
Pain or peace.

36:41.599 --> 36:43.101
Andrew?

36:43.768 --> 36:45.543
It's Corey.

36:46.004 --> 36:49.417
Please. Listen to me.

36:49.607 --> 36:52.349
You have to stop this.

36:52.544 --> 36:56.253
Revenge, it's hollow.

36:56.448 --> 36:58.860
And it's pointless.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.758
It won't bring you back.

37:02.954 --> 37:08.927
I should've said this earlier,
but I couldn't let go.

37:09.127 --> 37:13.701
But it's time for me to let go.

37:13.898 --> 37:16.401
And for you to do the same.

37:18.136 --> 37:22.141
Please. I'm begging you.

37:28.813 --> 37:30.486
Do this for me.

37:32.817 --> 37:33.989
Do it for us.

37:40.825 --> 37:42.498
Goodbye.

38:11.523 --> 38:13.503
You sure you wanna do this?

38:14.626 --> 38:18.267
Yeah.
I should've done this a long time ago.

38:46.124 --> 38:47.660
Come in.

38:52.964 --> 38:56.241
Looks like Andrew wasn't the only one
who chose peace.

38:57.468 --> 38:59.675
Yeah, looks like.

39:00.738 --> 39:03.514
I think I'm gonna follow his lead too.

39:04.576 --> 39:05.816
What do you mean?

39:08.313 --> 39:10.088
My peace is helping people...

39:11.249 --> 39:12.922
...working cases.

39:13.151 --> 39:14.926
That's all I wanna do.

39:20.558 --> 39:22.333
Is this about the Mark?

39:22.527 --> 39:24.871
I'm done trying to find a cure, Sammy.

39:25.530 --> 39:28.773
- Dean, Cass is so close.
- To what?

39:29.567 --> 39:31.945
We don't even know if there is a cure.

39:33.071 --> 39:34.880
So far, we've got nothing.

39:35.073 --> 39:37.451
We have found nothing
at the Men of Letters' library.

39:37.675 --> 39:39.450
Metatron may or may not know something.

39:39.677 --> 39:43.625
And maybe Cass is onto something with Cain.
Maybe.

39:43.848 --> 39:45.054
Yeah, maybe.

39:45.250 --> 39:47.787
Nothing is guaranteed, Dean. So what?

39:48.019 --> 39:52.263
- We can't just stop fighting.
- Yes, we can.

39:53.591 --> 39:56.731
So this is it? You're just gonna give up?

39:56.928 --> 39:59.966
No, no, I'm not just gonna give up.

40:03.234 --> 40:05.874
I appreciate the effort, okay? I do.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.550
But the answer, it's not out there.

40:09.474 --> 40:12.819
It's with me. I need to be the one
calling the shots here, okay?

40:13.044 --> 40:17.288
I can't keep waking up every morning
with this false hope.

40:18.049 --> 40:22.293
I gotta know where I stand,
otherwise I'm gonna lose my freaking mind.

40:27.992 --> 40:32.134
So I'm gonna fight it
until I can't fight it anymore.

40:33.932 --> 40:36.412
And when all is said and done...

40:37.902 --> 40:39.848
...I'll go down swinging.
