WEBVTT

00:06.981 --> 00:09.370
Yeah, hold on!

00:09.541 --> 00:13.370
Hey, Vic, it's me! Open up!

00:13.509 --> 00:15.165
–What's up?
–You see this?

00:15.205 --> 00:17.726
–What?
–I thought Lanie's report
wasn't coming out for weeks.

00:17.766 --> 00:20.224
–It's not.
–What's it doing there in black and white?

00:20.264 --> 00:23.300
–Are we named?
–Yeah, Strike Team's mentioned.

00:24.710 --> 00:26.914
You bitch.

00:29.607 --> 00:31.653
Well, at least we're not alone.

00:31.687 --> 00:36.259
Aceveda's name is mentioned…
more than three times.

00:36.456 --> 00:38.845
Will you get me a towel, please?

00:41.192 --> 00:44.756
–See you downstairs in a few minutes.
–All right, man.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:55.402 --> 00:59.396
–Yeah?
–Just reading the newspaper. Have you?

00:59.690 --> 01:01.954
Lakers cut it pretty close last night.

01:01.994 --> 01:04.066
They're not the only ones.

01:07.339 --> 01:08.868
That about the Armadillo thing?

01:08.908 --> 01:11.284
I just don't like not liking my job.

01:11.307 --> 01:14.435
Well, lucky for you we might not
have jobs in a couple of weeks.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.166
We better talk,
get our stories straight.

01:16.206 --> 01:19.429
I don't have time to talk. I have to
manage perhaps the most dysfunctional…

01:19.469 --> 01:22.186
inefficient precinct in the city.

01:24.780 --> 01:27.082
–Yeah?
–Vic, Gilroy called.

01:27.117 --> 01:30.663
–What?
–Gilroy. He called here at the house.

01:30.734 --> 01:33.446
–You spoke to him?
–He left a message on the machine.

01:33.486 --> 01:36.038
He said he was coming over.
I thought he was in jail.

01:36.078 --> 01:38.310
Well, he's out on bail, but he's
supposed to be under house arrest.

01:38.350 --> 01:40.231
All right, I'm on the way.
Is the alarm on?

01:40.271 --> 01:42.383
Yes! What if he gets here first?

01:42.479 --> 01:44.711
Keep the doors locked
and the alarm on.

01:44.751 --> 01:47.399
I just got married. Now is not
a good time for me to be losing my job.

01:47.439 --> 01:49.163
That's not how it works.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.688
They start by offering older
officers early retirement.

01:51.728 --> 01:53.097
Then they cut
the discipline problems.

01:53.137 --> 01:55.817
They're not gonna take a young
black officer off the street…

01:55.857 --> 01:56.969
not in this district.

01:57.009 --> 01:58.922
–The only one that's in trouble is me.
–No way.

01:58.962 --> 02:03.054
Do you know they practically
blamed me for Armadillo's murder?

02:05.009 --> 02:06.732
Just a sec.

02:08.370 --> 02:11.210
I need to clear my name
on this Armadillo thing.

02:11.250 --> 02:14.122
–How can I help?
–You were the lead on the case.

02:14.162 --> 02:16.266
If there's anything you know
or discover, would you fill me in?

02:16.306 --> 02:19.471
–I'll keep an eye out.
–I patted that guy down.

02:19.635 --> 02:22.602
There's no way
I missed a knife that big.

02:22.739 --> 02:24.339
Maybe you didn't.

02:24.373 --> 02:27.884
The only thing I can think of is another
inmate must have given it to him.

02:27.924 --> 02:31.917
–Or another cop.
–Why would a…

02:32.052 --> 02:35.124
I probably shouldn't have said that.

02:35.157 --> 02:38.380
Wait. What are you talking about?
What do you mean?

02:38.420 --> 02:41.770
Sarge wants us
on the street. Now.

02:41.941 --> 02:44.309
I'll talk to you later.

02:46.965 --> 02:49.617
–I want to apologize!
–Go away!

02:49.750 --> 02:52.852
–I want to say I'm sorry!
–You said it! Now go!

02:52.855 --> 02:54.735
Please, I'm not here to hurt you!
I need to speak to Vic!

02:54.775 --> 02:57.492
Hey! Are you kidding me?

02:57.527 --> 02:59.567
I need to talk to you.
You wouldn't pick up the phone!

02:59.607 --> 03:01.231
–Vic, get rid of him!
–Corrine.

03:01.271 --> 03:03.407
Shut up. Go back inside.
I've got this under control.

03:03.447 --> 03:04.920
–Vic!
–Go inside!

03:04.953 --> 03:06.704
You were supposed to be
under house arrest.

03:06.744 --> 03:10.374
–I cut off my ankle transmitter.
–You've gone fugitive?

03:10.680 --> 03:13.585
–Let me explain this.
–Save it! I'm hauling your ass in.

03:13.625 --> 03:16.209
Sure, and you can start
sizing up the cell next to mine.

03:16.249 --> 03:18.737
The D.A wants me
to give you up.

03:18.937 --> 03:21.009
There's nothin' to give up.

03:21.145 --> 03:23.983
There's places you don't
want them lookin'.

03:23.993 --> 03:26.394
I can't go to prison, Vic.

03:26.427 --> 03:28.626
The best my lawyer can do
is eight years.

03:28.666 --> 03:30.608
My liver can't do seven.

03:30.746 --> 03:34.580
I'm not gonna rat you out,
but I'm not gonna go back to jail.

03:34.620 --> 03:37.234
–You're running out of options.
–Help me get out of the country.

03:37.274 --> 03:38.998
No!

03:39.195 --> 03:41.769
Once I'm gone,
you're in the clear too.

03:51.388 --> 03:54.647
They wanted me to wear a wire.
I told them to go to hell.

03:54.687 --> 03:58.383
We haven't got a lot of time, Vic.
We gotta do this now.

04:04.382 --> 04:08.022
–I'm not gonna do this.
–Then you better put a gun to my head…

04:08.062 --> 04:10.231
because if you send me
back to prison…

04:10.271 --> 04:12.581
I'm not gonna hold out
much longer.

04:14.014 --> 04:16.535
Just help me
get across the border.

04:21.343 --> 04:23.351
Get in the car.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.648
What a stupid bastard you are.

04:47.426 --> 04:50.426
Fresh clothes.
You owe me $200.

04:52.066 --> 04:53.851
–How you doin', Shane?
–Great.

04:53.891 --> 04:56.347
All right, your picture's gonna be
plastered at every border crossing…

04:56.387 --> 04:58.077
so you're gonna need paper
to survive on the other side.

04:58.117 --> 05:01.212
I'll need American and Mexican
passports and I.D and money.

05:01.252 --> 05:04.540
Oh, you lookin' for a loan from us,
you can tickle my zipper.

05:04.580 --> 05:08.804
This key here opens up a safe-deposit
box. The money's in there.

05:09.029 --> 05:11.134
–How much?
–75·000.

05:11.268 --> 05:13.149
That's all you got left
from your land schemes?

05:13.189 --> 05:15.499
Sedona disappeared
with most of it.

05:15.654 --> 05:18.013
Seventy-five grand
isn't gonna last very long.

05:18.053 --> 05:21.918
Ah, I don't need much.
A hut on the beach and rice and beans.

05:21.958 --> 05:23.910
I'll make it last.

05:23.943 --> 05:27.705
–They'll look for you in Mexico.
–I know a guy in Brazil.

05:27.879 --> 05:31.392
I just need a ticket
from Mexico City to Rio.

05:31.559 --> 05:33.407
Jesus, what do we look like,
we're wearing little headsets?

05:33.447 --> 05:37.025
–Where's the money?
–Tellmare Savings on Vermont.

05:38.247 --> 05:40.735
–I owe you, Vic.
–Shut up.

05:42.984 --> 05:45.633
–Your report wasn't due for two weeks.
–That isn't my report.

05:45.673 --> 05:48.353
I was supposed to have advanced copy.
This is completely one-sided.

05:48.393 --> 05:50.563
Someone stole my notes, then
leaked the damaging portions to…

05:50.603 --> 05:53.569
–Who has access to your notes?
–That's what I'm trying to find out!

05:53.609 --> 05:55.107
The chief's office just called me!

05:55.147 --> 05:57.250
Do you have any idea
how much this screws me?

05:57.290 --> 05:59.177
Look!

05:59.211 --> 06:02.527
Look, the fact is
nothing was embellished.

06:03.018 --> 06:06.182
All the incidents
in the paper happened, David.

06:06.250 --> 06:09.682
I am sorry that they don't
show you in a good light…

06:09.963 --> 06:11.719
but they all happened.

06:11.915 --> 06:15.332
Aceveda and I picked out a new
Strike Team guy. He starts today.

06:15.372 --> 06:17.095
Talk about crappy timing.

06:17.292 --> 06:19.940
Lem, you keep him occupied.
Test him out. See how he runs.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.796
Why do I have to
baby-sit the new guy?

06:21.836 --> 06:25.220
Somebody's gotta handle our car-ring sting
while Vic and I clean up a little problem.

06:25.260 --> 06:28.359
–What problem?
–Gilroy skipped bail.

06:28.525 --> 06:30.919
Shane and I are gonna
slip him out of the country.

06:30.959 --> 06:33.189
I thought that we were gonna keep our
noses clean till we hit the money train.

06:33.229 --> 06:36.038
If Gilroy goes back inside,
starts cooperating with the DA….

06:36.078 --> 06:38.502
There won't be any money train
or anything else.

06:38.542 --> 06:40.422
Gilroy said the D.A came to him…

06:40.462 --> 06:43.687
so the question is who's
going to the D.A about us?

06:43.727 --> 06:45.515
–Lanie?
–Or Claudette.

06:45.710 --> 06:48.166
I'm thinkin' Aceveda.

06:48.334 --> 06:51.655
Whoever it is, timing on this
and the morning headline…

06:51.695 --> 06:53.575
is no coincidence.
–And you think they're related?

06:53.615 --> 06:55.592
I think we gotta be
extra careful.

06:55.632 --> 06:57.966
Look in every dark corner.

06:58.128 --> 07:00.300
Yeah?

07:00.432 --> 07:01.643
–Tavon.
–Hey.

07:01.776 --> 07:05.128
Tavon here has been
in Special Crimes the last few years.

07:05.168 --> 07:07.558
It's a job.
This one sounds better.

07:07.729 --> 07:11.177
–Lemonhead, Shane.
–What's up, man?

07:11.377 --> 07:13.738
Hell of a first day.
We still have jobs?

07:13.778 --> 07:16.650
All the assholes in this city…
we'll always have jobs.

07:16.690 --> 07:18.954
–So what's on the agenda?
–We have a one-day window…

07:18.994 --> 07:22.314
to sting the head of one of L.A's
biggest car theft rings.

07:22.354 --> 07:25.034
We've been targeting this guy
for a while, but he knows our faces.

07:25.074 --> 07:27.384
We've never been able to get close.

07:27.507 --> 07:30.769
You, however, he doesn't know.

07:30.932 --> 07:33.516
–Here's his file.
–It's a one-day trial period.

07:33.556 --> 07:35.466
Lem here'll fill you in.

07:37.172 --> 07:40.271
–Let's go.
–I guess it's on.

07:40.404 --> 07:42.222
What's the deal
with Mr Special Crimes?

07:42.262 --> 07:44.461
Seems a little too cool
for school, don't you think?

07:44.501 --> 07:46.085
Let's give him a chance.

07:46.197 --> 07:48.110
I remember the last guy
we gave a chance to.

07:48.150 --> 07:51.086
This time I did my homework.
I spoke to him a couple of times.

07:51.126 --> 07:53.581
–He seems straight up.
–Yeah, we'll see.

07:53.621 --> 07:55.606
Toni Jahnes, 71, widow.

07:55.639 --> 07:58.382
–Looks like the intruder entered here.
–What's missing?

07:58.422 --> 08:00.687
Nothing that couldn't travel.
No appliances.

08:00.727 --> 08:03.119
Someone did go through
the jewelry though.

08:03.159 --> 08:07.600
Robbery-homicide. Looks like
he hit her head on the mantle.

08:07.799 --> 08:10.901
Being so old, probably
couldn't put up a fight.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.880
You know I closed three robbery cases
last week, one homicide?

08:16.920 --> 08:18.966
Way above departmental average.

08:19.096 --> 08:20.976
Think that gets mentioned
in the report?

08:21.016 --> 08:22.959
No.

08:23.097 --> 08:25.683
–No.
–Sorry.

08:25.881 --> 08:28.783
Yeah, so am I.
Just doesn't seem fair.

08:28.922 --> 08:33.014
–Looks like she had two daughters.
–I saw that. How are yours?

08:33.018 --> 08:35.735
Good question.

08:58.397 --> 09:02.391
Look, Quazi's gonna get the money,
make the fake I.D's…

09:02.557 --> 09:06.805
and Gilroy will be out of our lives
for good with no blood spilled.

09:06.845 --> 09:11.352
I know you got a soft spot for Ben,
but if he goes sideways…

09:11.550 --> 09:13.860
I'm not gonna let him
hurt us, Vic.

09:28.640 --> 09:31.672
–Morning, Chief.
–Sorry I have to meet like this.

09:31.712 --> 09:34.330
I understand.
You're a busy man.

09:36.801 --> 09:38.681
–So.
–I was supposed to have a chance…

09:38.721 --> 09:41.209
to respond to the report
before it went public.

09:41.249 --> 09:43.865
–Respond to it now.
–It's completely biased.

09:43.905 --> 09:45.753
Compared to other divisions…

09:45.826 --> 09:48.699
Farmington has the steepest
reduction in crime rates in the city.

09:48.739 --> 09:51.898
Our arrest records far outweigh
any allegations of misconduct.

09:51.938 --> 09:54.305
What would you do in my position?

09:55.907 --> 09:58.843
–My first instinct would be to fire me.
–So far, I'm with you.

09:58.883 --> 10:00.668
And then I'd think
how that might look.

10:00.708 --> 10:03.359
Fire me on the day
this news breaks…

10:03.588 --> 10:05.468
you give the charges credibility.

10:05.508 --> 10:07.884
Then when the whole truth
comes out…

10:07.910 --> 10:09.948
that the barn has a first-rate
return against crime…

10:09.988 --> 10:12.290
a real success story…

10:15.268 --> 10:20.637
I suggest you withhold judgment a while
before shaking things up.

10:22.245 --> 10:25.181
I've heard about this kind
of slick shit of yours.

10:25.221 --> 10:27.425
It doesn't work on me.

10:27.590 --> 10:29.306
You're running for office.

10:29.446 --> 10:32.126
I'll leave you as captain
until that run is over.

10:32.166 --> 10:34.240
If you win, you graduate
to city council…

10:34.280 --> 10:37.712
and you remember that
I gave you another six months.

10:37.895 --> 10:41.224
If you lose the primary…

10:41.257 --> 10:43.935
you need to spend
more time with your family…

10:43.975 --> 10:46.081
due to the strain…

10:46.216 --> 10:49.512
and you resign quietly.

10:50.825 --> 10:54.141
Relax, David.
Every campaign has a crisis point…

10:54.537 --> 10:57.057
which is why we always have
a contingency plan.

10:57.097 --> 10:59.847
–What?
–Campaña de ataques.

11:00.041 --> 11:01.898
A smear campaign? No.

11:01.931 --> 11:04.674
Dirty tricks might be the norm
in Mexico, but not here.

11:04.714 --> 11:07.330
Half of your voters
were born in Mexico, David.

11:07.370 --> 11:09.250
To them,
this is a way of life.

11:09.290 --> 11:11.170
Look, if I do this,
where does it stop?

11:11.210 --> 11:13.349
With you beating Karen Mitchell.

11:13.482 --> 11:15.843
No. No, I'm going
to rearrange the barn…

11:15.883 --> 11:18.243
and if I'm lucky, I can
get things back on track.

11:18.283 --> 11:20.163
I can turn things around
before the primary.

11:20.203 --> 11:23.880
Not soon enough.
Whoever leaked this…

11:24.300 --> 11:26.602
was coordinated and determined.

11:26.764 --> 11:30.376
We have to be all that, plus smarter.

11:30.572 --> 11:33.442
No. There's got to be a better way.

11:33.581 --> 11:36.197
You think Aceveda's the one
who went to the DA.?

11:36.237 --> 11:39.172
–Yeah.
–Backstabbing bastard.

11:39.309 --> 11:41.926
Who knows? Maybe he
caught wind of the report…

11:41.966 --> 11:44.210
figured he'd have us take the hit.

11:44.334 --> 11:46.758
Look, I don't like the timing of
this whole new Strike Team guy.

11:46.798 --> 11:48.522
Aceveda signed off on him.

11:48.718 --> 11:51.599
Maybe he knows something
that we don't.

11:51.632 --> 11:54.534
It's just one day.
He'll be gone tomorrow.

11:56.655 --> 11:58.030
Okay, he's got it.

12:00.144 --> 12:01.966
Oh, crap.

12:02.128 --> 12:05.032
I guess intelligence
is his second language.

12:07.248 --> 12:10.825
He can duplicate government documents
flawlessly. He can't tell
his left from his right.

12:10.865 --> 12:15.353
–He's nervous.
–I just hope he remembers
where the meeting place is.

12:23.602 --> 12:26.320
–Drop the weapon! Let go of her!
–Freeze!

12:26.514 --> 12:30.012
Get your hands off of her!
Hey, you, come here! Stop!

12:30.099 --> 12:32.619
On your knees!
On your knees!

12:32.819 --> 12:36.529
Get on your knees now!
Put your hands on the ground now!

12:36.723 --> 12:38.447
Open your mouth.

12:40.276 --> 12:42.578
Spit it out! Spit it!

12:42.740 --> 12:44.944
Turn over!

12:45.077 --> 12:46.865
Turn over.

12:48.084 --> 12:49.841
Jesus Christ.

12:51.893 --> 12:53.869
We talked to some of the girls
in your neighborhood.

12:53.909 --> 12:57.966
They said this isn't the first time you started
a fight in the last couple of weeks.

12:58.006 --> 13:02.606
You're eight months pregnant. You want
to tell us why you're mixin' it up?

13:02.646 --> 13:04.654
Just because I'm pregnant doesn't mean
I have to stop bringing it.

13:04.694 --> 13:07.599
–You're a little old to be brawlin'.
–You want to try me?

13:07.639 --> 13:10.543
Why don't you tell us about
the father, this Antonio.

13:10.583 --> 13:12.463
–I don't know, and I don't care.
–Maybe he cares.

13:12.503 --> 13:14.511
–Well, it ain't about him.
–No, it's about the baby.

13:14.551 --> 13:18.545
You don't want to hurt it, right?

13:18.680 --> 13:20.949
Right?

13:23.481 --> 13:25.586
You trying
to lose this baby?

13:25.720 --> 13:27.766
Look, whatever happens happens.

13:27.801 --> 13:30.518
I'm just gonna keep
doing my thing.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.594
And what about that
little boy inside of you?

13:32.634 --> 13:34.456
That's right. It's a boy.

13:34.554 --> 13:37.330
Which means it's gonna look like
Antonio, sound like Antonio…

13:37.370 --> 13:39.986
and I don't wanna be looking at a little
Antonio for the rest of my life.

13:40.026 --> 13:42.546
Have you thought about that?

13:46.459 --> 13:48.437
She worked for the Parks
Department for 30 years.

13:48.477 --> 13:51.699
Outlived both her daughters.
One was killed by a drunk driver.

13:51.739 --> 13:53.619
Other died of ovarian cancer last year.

13:53.659 --> 13:55.573
I ran a check on like crimes.

13:55.612 --> 13:57.844
–Three break-ins the last two weeks.
–That the report there?

13:57.884 --> 13:59.356
–No.
–What is it?

13:59.390 --> 14:04.442
Win list. I'm compiling
a folder of all my wins.

14:04.732 --> 14:07.573
Your wins? What have you
got to be worried about?

14:07.613 --> 14:10.773
–You've got a great jacket.
–You weren't mentioned in the report.

14:10.813 --> 14:15.222
–People remember headlines.
–M.E sent over Toni Jahnes's prelims.

14:15.389 --> 14:17.975
You can close your folder.

14:18.174 --> 14:20.862
–Wasn't a murder.
–What was it?

14:20.896 --> 14:23.894
Uh, she died of a heart attack,
not the blow to the head.

14:23.934 --> 14:25.496
When did she have
a heart attack?

14:25.536 --> 14:28.044
They haven't determined that yet.
Why?

14:28.223 --> 14:30.967
Because maybe she had it when
she saw the burglar in her house.

14:31.007 --> 14:33.497
File that under “we'll never know.”
Should I contact next of kin?

14:33.537 --> 14:37.167
She had no kin, no heirs,
no friends that I could tell.

14:37.248 --> 14:40.958
Heart attack probably
doesn't qualify as a win, does it?

14:44.385 --> 14:47.615
Ben? Ben!

14:51.073 --> 14:54.298
These were my last two beers,
the only booze I had left in the house.

14:54.338 --> 14:56.698
–Goddamn it. Come on.
–Where we goin'?

14:56.738 --> 14:59.772
Nearest bar.

15:05.603 --> 15:08.771
–Here are my buddies right now.
–You the police?

15:08.900 --> 15:11.262
–Yeah. Why?
–He got physical with my customers.

15:11.302 --> 15:13.692
When I go to remove him,
he says he's a cop.

15:13.732 --> 15:15.772
I called 20 minutes ago about this guy.

15:15.812 --> 15:19.357
–Good thing I wasn't being robbed.
–Okay, we'll take care of it.

15:19.397 --> 15:21.311
–Stand up now and walk out with us.
–Hey, Vic, listen.

15:21.351 --> 15:23.389
You know how long it's been
since I've had a drink?

15:23.429 --> 15:27.969
–Fifteen seconds?
–Four months in jail.

15:28.165 --> 15:30.045
I want to buy you guys a drink.

15:30.085 --> 15:31.934
–The cops are on their way here.
–Let's buy them a drink too.

15:31.974 --> 15:35.422
–Stop making a scene, you dumbass.
–Oh, no! You!

15:35.623 --> 15:38.590
This could be my last chance here.

15:38.726 --> 15:41.061
It is your last chance. Get up!

15:41.223 --> 15:43.940
Ooh! God…

15:44.135 --> 15:46.274
Oh, geez!
Grab him.

15:46.407 --> 15:49.375
Hey, I can't do this thing.

15:49.512 --> 15:51.304
–Come on.
–I can't do it.

15:51.337 --> 15:53.632
When our backup shows,
you tell 'em we took care of it.

15:53.672 --> 15:57.120
–Hey, who's gonna take care of the tab?
–Go ahead.

15:59.592 --> 16:04.212
Louis, you want a break on this
drug charge, you're gonna help us out.

16:04.233 --> 16:06.529
Denon's my cousin.
I can't dime him out.

16:06.569 --> 16:09.537
–Why not?
–He's my cousin.

16:09.674 --> 16:11.170
It'll screw up Christmas…

16:11.210 --> 16:15.072
and I'm not lettin'some
cracker cop ruin the holidays.

16:15.210 --> 16:17.186
What'd you say to the man?
What'd you say?

16:17.226 --> 16:21.155
Get off of me!
Get off me, man!

16:21.291 --> 16:23.975
Easy, brother.

16:24.171 --> 16:27.012
Dude, there's cameras in here, man.
You gotta watch your shit.

16:27.052 --> 16:29.508
I heard we did things
different around here.

16:29.548 --> 16:31.687
Well, you heard wrong.

16:34.156 --> 16:36.036
Listen, you go along willingly…

16:36.076 --> 16:39.877
or I release you right now and tell your
homo homies you're my snitch bitch.

16:39.917 --> 16:41.797
All right?
You're gonna help us.

16:41.837 --> 16:44.411
It's up to you
how much it has to hurt.

16:47.278 --> 16:49.351
Come on now, Louis.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.853
This boy's just your cousin.

16:52.014 --> 16:54.654
Ain't like he's
your brother or nothin'.

16:58.671 --> 17:01.421
What'd he say?

17:01.519 --> 17:03.400
He's drunk. He wants him
to sober up first.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.636
Oh, no, ese, uh-uh.

17:06.895 --> 17:08.551
–Where's my money?
–We're holding on to it for now.

17:08.592 --> 17:12.156
Why don't you wait until Quazi
does your I.D makeover?

17:12.434 --> 17:14.473
–What?
–We got the cousin to roll.

17:14.512 --> 17:17.160
Meeting with Denon's
set up for this afternoon.

17:17.200 --> 17:20.521
–Aceveda wants a progress report.
–Okay, tell him we're on the way.

17:20.560 --> 17:24.059
Sting's happening. Let's go.
We gotta get down there.

17:54.805 --> 17:57.423
–Where's Claudette?
–Not sure.

17:58.901 --> 18:01.358
–What are you doing, Dutch?
–Little homework.

18:01.398 --> 18:03.534
How about a little police work
instead of dusting off your résumé?

18:03.574 --> 18:06.771
You, uh, saying I don't need to?

18:06.934 --> 18:08.848
Shooting with casualties
on Penn and Sunset.

18:08.888 --> 18:11.279
–Find Claudette and get down there.
–Yes, sir.

18:11.319 --> 18:14.767
Hey! Where you been?
Been lookin' all over for you.

18:14.967 --> 18:17.553
Nice try.

18:17.655 --> 18:21.720
–How's Tavon doing?
–He seems to be trying hard.

18:21.754 --> 18:24.080
Yeah, we all should be
doing that about now.

18:24.120 --> 18:28.049
If you've got a case that you could close,
today would be a good day to do it.

18:28.089 --> 18:30.161
What, are you worried
about keeping your job?

18:30.201 --> 18:33.235
I'm a Latino police captain.

18:33.465 --> 18:36.145
I could find a spot tomorrow
in a dozen cities.

18:36.185 --> 18:39.154
–You're the one who should be worried.
–Well, if we stick together…

18:39.194 --> 18:42.423
neither one of us will have to worry.

18:42.586 --> 18:46.962
I'm still willing to honor our deal.
What about you?

18:47.131 --> 18:50.447
Our arrangement's
more important than ever.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.107
Aceveda's definitely screwing us.

18:54.141 --> 18:57.139
–How do you know?
–He's saying all the right things.

18:57.179 --> 18:59.828
Only wants to know about the new guy
and our car thief bust.

18:59.868 --> 19:02.484
–Nothing about Gilroy.
–Well, it must be an epidemic.

19:02.524 --> 19:06.101
The assistant chief of police is on the
run, there's not one single news story.

19:06.141 --> 19:09.590
D.A's too embarrassed to put
the word out on the news yet.

19:09.630 --> 19:12.245
We gotta take advantage
of the time while we can.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.165
You track down Coyote Jack yet?

19:14.205 --> 19:16.789
Yeah. He's delivering a shipment
of illegals in about an hour.

19:16.829 --> 19:20.063
Got the drop point from my C.I.
We're good to go.

19:22.206 --> 19:24.662
–You back from the scene?
–Yeah.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.063
–How many casualties?
–Just the one.

19:27.103 --> 19:29.943
Still trying to figure out whether she
was dead before or during the break-in.

19:29.983 --> 19:33.465
–What? This is the shooting on Penn?
–No. I'm working the Jahnes case.

19:33.505 --> 19:36.183
I thought that got knocked down
to a simple B-and-E.

19:36.223 --> 19:39.544
Not by me. If the burglar caused her
heart attack, he killed her.

19:39.584 --> 19:42.104
–The law doesn't see it that way.
–I do.

19:42.144 --> 19:45.341
You were to move on to a priority crime.

19:45.505 --> 19:47.894
–Where's Dutch?
–I don't know.

19:48.065 --> 19:51.643
I guess he's got
his priorities straight.

19:51.841 --> 19:53.565
And you?

19:55.106 --> 19:58.434
I'm finishing what I started.

19:58.468 --> 20:02.745
This is a break-in with no victim.
Move on to a real case.

20:04.130 --> 20:06.498
I am working a real case!

20:06.659 --> 20:09.019
And if you spent more time
letting me and less time stopping me…

20:09.059 --> 20:11.163
maybe these people wouldn't have
to worry about their families…

20:11.203 --> 20:13.500
how they're gonna feed them
because of a bunch of crap…

20:13.540 --> 20:16.508
they know nothing about
and had nothing to do with!

20:16.548 --> 20:18.042
Damn it!

20:20.388 --> 20:22.909
No wonder this precinct's upside down.

20:24.132 --> 20:27.842
Saving these people's jobs
should be your priority.

20:31.813 --> 20:33.537
Damn!

20:35.974 --> 20:38.341
–Are you okay?
–Am I being graded?

20:39.623 --> 20:40.966
Sorry.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.215
It's going to be hard to back away
from the things leaked in those notes…

20:45.255 --> 20:46.881
no matter what
my final report says.

20:46.921 --> 20:51.277
–So some of us are gonna be swept away.
–That is the way it looks.

20:51.719 --> 20:56.009
But maybe you can help me point
the broom in the right direction.

20:58.888 --> 21:00.611
Maybe.

21:16.619 --> 21:19.336
–Hola.
–Policía.

21:19.531 --> 21:24.619
¡Vamos!
¡Vayanse! ¡Vayanse!

21:24.652 --> 21:28.546
Coyote Jack, looks like you
brought a full load north, huh?

21:32.716 --> 21:35.400
Get out! Now!

21:35.596 --> 21:38.760
–This is I.N.S?
–No. That's downtown…

21:38.924 --> 21:41.102
about three miles away from here.

21:41.103 --> 21:43.845
–We can drop you off there too.
–Look, those people were hitchhikers.

21:43.885 --> 21:45.415
I picked them up
outside of Oceanside.

21:45.455 --> 21:49.349
We want to hire you to drop
someone back across the border.

21:49.421 --> 21:52.005
What? You want me to smuggle
somebody into Mexico?

21:52.045 --> 21:54.763
Yeah. How much
for something like that?

21:54.830 --> 21:56.903
–I never charged anybody before.
–Come on.

21:56.943 --> 21:58.344
We know the tunnels run both ways.

21:58.384 --> 22:00.807
Now, you can either help us
deliver our package…

22:00.847 --> 22:03.487
or we can deliver you
inside to booking.

22:06.447 --> 22:09.087
I'll get your package
across the border.

22:10.736 --> 22:12.712
I thought you were
at the Penn shooting.

22:12.752 --> 22:15.016
I'd rather be working with my partner.

22:15.056 --> 22:17.320
–Broke easy, huh?
–Caught the guy two blocks away…

22:17.360 --> 22:19.662
.22 still in his belt.

22:19.857 --> 22:23.487
Another win. All we gotta do now
is file the paperwork.

22:24.209 --> 22:26.346
But I came here before I did that.

22:26.386 --> 22:29.103
Congratulations.
Check the kitchen.

22:33.490 --> 22:35.891
–What's up, Louis?
–What's up, guy?

22:35.924 --> 22:38.696
–A'ight.
–This nigga here got a bead, man…

22:38.963 --> 22:41.603
on a fleet of Expeditions, man.
–A'ight.

22:42.451 --> 22:46.015
Yo, I ain't never seen you before.
Where your hood at?

22:46.100 --> 22:48.974
Detroit, man. Guess that's why
a nigga's into rides, right?

22:49.014 --> 22:52.380
–Who you run with?
–Fourth Street Clown Posse here.

22:56.597 --> 22:58.477
So I hear you're movin' trucks.

22:58.517 --> 23:00.273
–Yo.
–What condition?

23:00.469 --> 23:02.861
Factory fresh.
Straight outta Motown.

23:02.901 --> 23:04.428
How's it work?

23:04.629 --> 23:07.887
A'ight. My boy's a truck foreman.
He assigns the routes.

23:07.927 --> 23:12.217
Driver of the rig, he gets a small
piece of the action, you know?

23:15.095 --> 23:18.414
A'ight. I'll pay you
10 G's a truck, 11 for leather.

23:18.454 --> 23:19.857
Hell, no. That ain't
what I get in Detroit, man.

23:19.897 --> 23:23.696
–This ain't Detroit, bitch!
–You better back up off me, bitch.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.178
–Are you callin' me a bitch?
–Oh, no.

23:26.295 --> 23:28.597
Hey, yo, kill that, man.

23:31.225 --> 23:33.528
Nah, man, nah.

23:33.562 --> 23:37.074
No, this your turf,
so they're your terms, a'ight?

23:37.497 --> 23:39.767
–Damn straight.
–A'ight.

23:39.897 --> 23:44.319
Look, just tell me when and where
you want the wheels, and we good.

23:46.649 --> 23:48.373
What do you got?

23:48.570 --> 23:51.636
Well, someone took all her lipstick.

23:51.770 --> 23:54.490
A girl could never
resist free lipstick.

23:54.524 --> 23:58.836
I got three empty bags of cookies
and a half-eaten bag of brown sugar.

23:58.876 --> 24:00.245
–Junkie girl.
–Should I check with Vic…

24:00.285 --> 24:03.124
see who's running junk on the block?
–I don't need a special team.

24:03.164 --> 24:05.466
I'll do my own police work.

24:11.037 --> 24:12.760
Evening.

24:12.957 --> 24:14.998
Your mama know you're hanging out
in a bad neighborhood?

24:15.038 --> 24:17.621
–Got me a note says it's a'ight.
–What's your name?

24:17.661 --> 24:20.345
–Long John.
–The pirate gangster, huh?

24:20.381 --> 24:24.059
Okay, let's empty your pockets.
Hands up.

24:24.701 --> 24:26.966
We're lookin' for
one of your customers.

24:27.006 --> 24:28.730
Don't got no customers.

24:28.894 --> 24:31.829
And I talk to you,
I ain't got 'em no more.

24:31.934 --> 24:35.063
We're looking for a girl.
Probably bought last night.

24:35.103 --> 24:37.047
Maybe tried to trade
jewelry for rock.

24:37.087 --> 24:40.502
Oh! Didn't think I could
reach that, did you?

24:42.335 --> 24:44.702
Oh, my.

24:44.864 --> 24:48.126
L.J, come on.

24:49.601 --> 24:52.536
–I walk on the rock, right?
–Depends.

24:55.809 --> 24:59.126
This transie, calls herself Mancy.
It was her.

24:59.298 --> 25:02.080
Is Mancy a transie
or a cross-dresser?

25:02.274 --> 25:05.591
–Is there a difference?
–Fairly large one.

25:07.747 --> 25:08.827
–Anything?
–No.

25:08.963 --> 25:11.610
No A.P.B., no sheriff's request,
no bench warrants…

25:11.650 --> 25:14.011
no Department of Corrections
notifications.

25:14.051 --> 25:16.796
I'm tellin' you, man.
There is no one lookin' for Gilroy.

25:16.836 --> 25:18.973
–That doesn't make sense.
–Guy cut off his ankle transmitter…

25:19.013 --> 25:22.577
and bailed eight hours ago.
–Maybe it's a malfunction.

25:22.724 --> 25:26.749
On the same day that Lanie's report
gets leaked to the press? It's unlikely.

25:26.789 --> 25:28.512
Goddamn it.

25:30.853 --> 25:32.795
There's something very wrong.

25:35.653 --> 25:38.045
–I don't buy it.
–You were worried about your job.

25:38.085 --> 25:39.744
You asked for answers.

25:39.878 --> 25:42.814
–Make your own conclusions.
–Look, I know Vic.

25:42.854 --> 25:44.768
He wouldn't do
something like this…

25:44.808 --> 25:47.646
and hang me out to dry for it.
He wouldn't.

25:48.455 --> 25:50.178
He wouldn't.

25:52.391 --> 25:54.115
Sorry to waste your time.

26:04.649 --> 26:06.721
–What's he keep saying?
–He says stop smiling.

26:06.761 --> 26:10.391
–It makes you look gay.
–Just take the picture, monkey.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.955
–You done?
–Yeah.

26:16.362 --> 26:21.862
Plane ticket. Plus, we had to take
10·000 out of the 75 for expenses.

26:22.122 --> 26:26.214
–Expenses for what?
–Coyote who's gonna give you a ride.

26:26.667 --> 26:29.034
Okay, yeah, sure.

26:29.195 --> 26:31.875
I know you guys don't
want to talk about this…

26:31.915 --> 26:35.145
but the D.A's been
asking me about Terry.

26:35.275 --> 26:39.749
Just been… I think they're gonna
reopen his shooting.

26:39.980 --> 26:43.236
I didn't tell them how I warned you
Terry was looking to take you down…

26:43.276 --> 26:45.546
but they're still
sniffing around.

26:45.709 --> 26:50.248
There's nothing solid tying you
to his dying, right? Is there?

26:50.445 --> 26:54.439
Terry got killed in the line
of duty by a drug dealer.

26:54.574 --> 26:58.950
Come on, Vic. It's just us.
I'm trying to look out for you.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.543
What are you doin'?
You already did…

27:14.895 --> 27:17.197
Goddamn it.

27:21.649 --> 27:24.297
No transmitter.
Just a tape recorder and a mike.

27:24.337 --> 27:27.534
We checked him twice.

27:27.697 --> 27:31.050
That's what the trip
to the bar was about, wasn't it?

27:31.090 --> 27:34.654
–I'm sorry, Vic.
–Son of a bitch. What'd you tell 'em?

27:34.674 --> 27:37.544
–Nothin'!
–What'd you tell 'em?

27:37.618 --> 27:40.138
I don't believe you!
What do they know? What do they know?

27:40.178 --> 27:42.923
Th-They're surveilling me
outside the building!

27:42.963 --> 27:45.199
They're surveilling me.

27:45.363 --> 27:47.086
What?

27:47.251 --> 27:51.081
If anything happens to me,
they're gonna know.

27:53.395 --> 27:57.429
Oh, this is not good. This bastard
has guys following us?

27:57.462 --> 27:59.821
What do you think
they've seen? The bar?

27:59.861 --> 28:02.130
The bank? Quazi?
Coyote Jack?

28:02.292 --> 28:06.319
Even if they have,
it doesn't matter.

28:07.573 --> 28:10.574
It doesn't matter.
They can't use any of it against us.

28:10.614 --> 28:14.444
He asked us for our help.
It's entrapment.

28:16.790 --> 28:20.559
The tape. It's the only thing
he can use against us, and we have it.

28:20.599 --> 28:23.407
Know what they have? They have
our asses, is what they have, man.

28:23.447 --> 28:26.959
–We've been harboring a fugitive.
–Not anymore we're not.

28:26.999 --> 28:29.168
You're going to Mexico
just like we planned.

28:29.208 --> 28:32.503
–How am I gonna live?
–On the 75 grand, dipshit.

28:32.664 --> 28:36.050
–Tell you what. Make that 65.
–It's not gonna last me a year.

28:36.090 --> 28:37.905
What about the hut,
the rice and the beans?

28:37.945 --> 28:40.050
I wasn't really going.

28:40.185 --> 28:43.419
Oh, you're going, all right.
Get up. Get dressed.

28:53.754 --> 28:55.958
Oh, for Christ's sake.

28:56.122 --> 28:59.538
I didn't want to do it.

28:59.707 --> 29:02.936
They made me.

29:03.099 --> 29:07.028
It took every drink
that I had to do it.

29:07.164 --> 29:10.328
Sorry, Vic.
I'm sorry, man.

29:15.037 --> 29:18.266
Ben, we need you now.

29:18.429 --> 29:20.309
Listen, you pull
yourself together.

29:20.349 --> 29:23.033
We can still all win here.

29:23.230 --> 29:25.654
I'm just gonna need you to lose
the tail on your own now.

29:25.694 --> 29:27.608
–What?
–Just gotta make sure…

29:27.614 --> 29:29.974
that whoever's watching
sees us leaving without him.

29:30.014 --> 29:32.310
We're putting our success
in his hands? Jesus!

29:32.350 --> 29:34.174
Relax!

29:34.208 --> 29:38.036
Ben's done some of his best work
soused, haven't you, Ben?

29:38.046 --> 29:42.324
How'd I get here, Vic?
How'd I get here?

29:42.399 --> 29:44.824
Let's just cut our losses
right now and turn him in.

29:44.864 --> 29:47.226
The guy's been nothing
but poison from the start.

29:47.266 --> 29:51.389
–No. He can do this.
–Vic, come on! He's tanked, man!

29:51.808 --> 29:53.880
I'm not depending on this guy,
not for anything.

29:53.920 --> 29:58.606
We send him back to prison.
He starts talking. He makes our lives hell.

30:00.001 --> 30:01.725
He can do it.

30:03.233 --> 30:05.438
He can do it.

30:09.666 --> 30:11.739
–Captain?
–Yeah?

30:11.874 --> 30:13.817
Ben Gilroy skipped bail.

30:13.955 --> 30:15.450
–What?
–How do you know that?

30:15.490 --> 30:18.491
He came over my house, asked me
to help him get out of the country.

30:18.531 --> 30:21.019
–Just now?
–No. This morning.

30:21.219 --> 30:23.727
–Why didn't you bring him in then?
–I…

30:25.412 --> 30:29.532
I've known him for 15 years. I was
trying to get him to come in on his own.

30:29.572 --> 30:31.948
He wouldn't.
I want to help the guy…

30:32.101 --> 30:33.948
but I'm not gonna
commit a felony doing it.

30:33.988 --> 30:36.542
Where is he now?

30:36.741 --> 30:40.189
He's still at my apartment. You're gonna have
to send someone to pick him up.

30:40.229 --> 30:42.913
He's drunk. He's crying his eyes out.

30:43.110 --> 30:45.618
I wasn't gonna
bring him in like that.

30:46.982 --> 30:49.633
I'll call it in.

30:49.830 --> 30:52.894
Vic, Denon just called. He wants
to move those cars right now.

30:52.934 --> 30:53.633
–Now?
–Yeah.

30:53.673 --> 30:55.231
–Supposed to be tomorrow.
–He changed his mind.

30:55.271 --> 30:58.079
–It's now or never.
–Denon, the stolen car guy?

30:58.119 --> 31:01.191
–Yeah.
–He's major. Go get him.

31:01.225 --> 31:04.459
Okay, round everybody up.
I'll meet you out back.

31:10.409 --> 31:12.289
–Can we talk?
–I'm in a hurry. Later, okay?

31:12.329 --> 31:14.785
All this shit's going down.
People could be losing their jobs…

31:14.825 --> 31:16.450
especially me.

31:16.649 --> 31:19.043
I'm at the top of the list
because of this Armadillo thing.

31:19.083 --> 31:21.282
Look, you shouldn't have
been suspended for that.

31:21.322 --> 31:24.486
It was unfair, okay?

31:24.650 --> 31:27.203
Word is that Armadillo dying
could've been good for you.

31:27.243 --> 31:30.850
–What word is that?
–Look, this is my career, goddamn it.

31:30.890 --> 31:33.251
Took me six and a half years
to get here, and I'm not gonna lose it.

31:33.291 --> 31:35.683
Who's been talking about me?
Claudette?

31:35.723 --> 31:37.928
What happened in that cage?

31:38.123 --> 31:42.404
I don't know. These guys hide things
sometimes. Sometimes cops miss them.

31:42.444 --> 31:47.114
No. You know damn well
I'm not gonna miss something like that.

31:47.245 --> 31:49.188
You had something
to do with this, didn't you?

31:49.228 --> 31:51.629
–No.
–Yeah, you did.

31:51.662 --> 31:55.094
Danny. Jesus Christ,
think about what you're saying.

31:55.438 --> 31:58.318
Jesus Christ,
I know what I'm saying.

31:58.352 --> 32:00.709
Goddamn it, and after all
that I have covered for you…

32:00.749 --> 32:02.993
everything that
I've done for you?

32:03.118 --> 32:07.176
I've never said a word to anybody
about anything, and you pull this on me?

32:07.216 --> 32:11.638
Goddamn it, I know what I'm saying.
You stay the hell away from me.

32:26.545 --> 32:28.487
Mancy!
You know where she is?

32:32.530 --> 32:34.024
Where's Mancy?

32:43.987 --> 32:45.743
Mancy.

32:48.947 --> 32:50.955
Good Lord.

32:54.964 --> 32:56.812
Let's get her to a hospital.

33:06.677 --> 33:10.834
He says Gilroy's still in the apartment.
Can your men see him?

33:10.997 --> 33:13.835
Where is the rest
of the surveillance team?

33:15.318 --> 33:19.246
No. Just go in now.
Make sure you get the tape.

33:23.190 --> 33:25.038
Everyone, listen up, please.

33:25.111 --> 33:28.111
Could I have your attention?

33:28.247 --> 33:32.176
I should have said this
12 hours ago.

33:36.984 --> 33:38.707
We're a team.

33:38.904 --> 33:41.326
A family.

33:41.497 --> 33:43.377
And I'm gonna fight like hell…

33:43.417 --> 33:46.319
to save every single job
in this building.

33:50.105 --> 33:54.546
In the meantime, let's just
focus on what we do best.

33:57.786 --> 33:59.509
Protect and serve.

34:10.362 --> 34:12.087
Nice speech.

34:13.947 --> 34:15.670
Could be my last.

34:17.724 --> 34:20.092
So you caught the, uh,
B-and-E guy?

34:20.126 --> 34:23.802
Yeah. He saw the body,
decided to break in.

34:24.188 --> 34:26.261
He was not the cause
of the heart attack.

34:26.301 --> 34:29.181
At least now you know.
Death was natural.

34:29.215 --> 34:31.987
She had her time.
That's some consolation.

34:32.253 --> 34:35.036
Not really.
She died alone.

34:41.853 --> 34:44.054
We can put you in lockup,
we can talk to a judge…

34:44.094 --> 34:45.655
and have you detained
till that baby is born.

34:45.695 --> 34:48.063
Go ahead. Put me in County.

34:48.097 --> 34:50.616
What? You don't think
there's other ways to do it?

34:50.656 --> 34:53.885
Fighting's just the way
you get the most props.

34:54.047 --> 34:56.792
If you don't want the kid, it's okay.
You can give him to somebody else.

34:56.831 --> 35:00.313
Yeah, like who? Antonio?

35:01.793 --> 35:04.062
Did you talk to him?

35:05.505 --> 35:07.415
Yeah, we talked to him.

35:07.554 --> 35:11.580
What'd he say?
Does he want me back?

35:13.122 --> 35:15.762
Does he want to be
the daddy of his son?

35:16.930 --> 35:20.635
Look, we can find a good foster home for
your son. At least give him a chance.

35:20.675 --> 35:24.417
You ever try giving away a brown baby?

35:24.515 --> 35:27.035
Come on, now.
Not even his daddy wants him.

35:27.075 --> 35:30.011
–Do you want him?
–I will do everything that I can…

35:30.051 --> 35:32.796
to help you find the best
possible home for your son.

35:32.836 --> 35:35.007
I'll take him.

35:35.141 --> 35:38.556
–What?
–I'll take him.

35:43.525 --> 35:48.545
I can make this work.
I want him.

35:50.565 --> 35:53.478
I ain't giving my baby to a white cop.

35:53.512 --> 35:56.086
I'd rather kill him
with my bare hands.

35:57.894 --> 36:00.578
Now get out of here.

36:00.775 --> 36:02.498
Get out!

36:09.672 --> 36:13.250
Vic! Vic!

36:13.449 --> 36:15.904
Told you.

36:16.073 --> 36:18.015
I made it.

36:18.153 --> 36:20.577
How many wine coolers
did it take you to get here?

36:20.617 --> 36:22.723
–Is this really necessary?
–Yes, it is.

36:22.763 --> 36:25.282
–You do everything I told you to do?
–Yeah, I'm here, aren't I?

36:25.322 --> 36:28.386
You took the bus, crossed the plaza,
went down to the subway station?

36:28.426 --> 36:31.170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I paid the coyote the $10·000…

36:31.210 --> 36:32.934
and then he gave me this.

36:35.563 --> 36:37.505
You lose the tail?

36:37.643 --> 36:39.689
I know how to lose a tail, Vic.

36:42.252 --> 36:44.740
Good. Everything's in place.

36:44.939 --> 36:47.340
–Time to go.
–Who's this?

36:47.374 --> 36:50.146
Coyote who's taking you
across the border.

36:50.156 --> 36:54.212
–Who was the guy in the subway?
–The hit man you paid $10·000 to…

36:54.252 --> 36:58.661
to kill you if I ever call this number
and tell him this code.

36:58.797 --> 37:00.677
You made me pay
my own hit man?

37:00.717 --> 37:03.366
I'll bet you really
need a drink now, don't you?

37:03.406 --> 37:07.300
You ever get caught, come back
on your own, doesn't matter.

37:07.342 --> 37:09.065
You're all done.

37:11.311 --> 37:12.805
Vic, we were friends.

37:12.975 --> 37:15.845
You were the one
who threatened my family.

37:15.983 --> 37:19.082
–It was a bluff!
–This isn't.

37:22.991 --> 37:27.498
You had the chance to pull
the trigger on me, and you couldn't.

37:27.728 --> 37:29.840
You're not gonna do this either.

37:31.536 --> 37:35.661
Maybe not, but Shane will.

37:43.057 --> 37:45.098
I guess this is good-bye.

37:45.234 --> 37:47.623
It better be.

37:47.795 --> 37:51.090
–Get in.
–Hey, Vic. Vic.

37:51.283 --> 37:53.804
Vic!

37:54.003 --> 37:55.945
I got greedy.

37:56.084 --> 37:57.807
I lost everything.

37:59.187 --> 38:01.035
There's a lesson there, Vic.

38:02.388 --> 38:04.112
Whatever.

38:20.086 --> 38:23.118
I didn't agree to buy no stolen rides,
man. Thought they was on the up and up.

38:23.158 --> 38:25.875
You got time.
Think of a better story.

38:26.070 --> 38:27.826
Our stolen car ringleader?

38:28.022 --> 38:30.191
–Not anymore, sir.
–Good. It's nice to have a win…

38:30.231 --> 38:32.141
on a day like today.

38:32.279 --> 38:34.319
Hey, Tavon.

38:34.488 --> 38:36.732
–These guys treat you okay?
–Yeah.

38:38.680 --> 38:40.404
Good.

38:42.712 --> 38:44.880
Well, looks like
we survived the day.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.929
Yeah, well, we always got tomorrow.

38:46.969 --> 38:48.751
We'll survive tomorrow too.

38:48.761 --> 38:52.984
–I wish I had your confidence.
–Yeah, a lot of people do.

38:53.049 --> 38:56.694
–Gilroy's not at Vic's apartment.
–What?

38:56.922 --> 38:59.762
He was there when I left,
lying passed out in a drunken stupor.

38:59.802 --> 39:01.364
Well, he must have sobered up
and walked away.

39:01.404 --> 39:04.836
All they found were his clothes
and a tape recorder.

39:05.082 --> 39:08.530
–Tape recorder?
–Unis are sweeping the neighborhood…

39:08.891 --> 39:11.067
but it looks like he's gone.

39:11.101 --> 39:14.665
Well, he couldn't have gone far,
not in his condition.

39:30.781 --> 39:34.043
Well, it looks like
I owe Aceveda an apology.

39:34.462 --> 39:36.309
The whole time I'm thinking he's the rat…

39:36.349 --> 39:38.583
when the real rodent's sitting drunk
at my apartment.
–Jesus.

39:38.623 --> 39:41.655
In 24 hours, Gilroy will be
Rio de Janeiro's problem.

39:41.695 --> 39:43.894
–How did Tavon grade out?
–Flying colors, man.

39:43.934 --> 39:45.527
–The guy's got cojones.
–It's not having them…

39:45.567 --> 39:48.855
it's using them that counts.
–Tavon's cool. He's a hard worker.

39:48.895 --> 39:51.289
A bit of a mean streak,
but under control.

39:51.329 --> 39:53.431
I think we may have
lucked out with this guy.

39:53.471 --> 39:55.415
Don't cream all over this guy
before you see him naked.

39:55.455 --> 39:57.050
He's no Ronnie,
and he's no you or me for that matter.

39:57.090 --> 39:59.897
I'm just saying he could open up
some new avenues for us…

39:59.937 --> 40:01.977
you know, being black and all.

40:09.121 --> 40:12.441
Transfer papers all signed.
Just need to call my old commander…

40:12.481 --> 40:15.715
let him know if I'm staying
or if I'm going back.

40:17.282 --> 40:21.537
Tell him you're staying
a little longer. Extended trial period.

40:23.298 --> 40:25.506
–You got it.
–Decent start.

40:25.540 --> 40:29.531
Just be ready for something a little
more difficult than auto capers.

40:29.571 --> 40:31.451
Can't wait to follow your lead.

40:31.491 --> 40:33.695
Great.

40:33.828 --> 40:37.628
Hey, Danny, you were serious
about keeping that kid, weren't you?

40:37.668 --> 40:39.392
It was a stupid idea.

40:39.588 --> 40:41.533
No, not if you really wanted to.

40:41.573 --> 40:45.151
I didn't, all right?
I just thought I did.

40:45.316 --> 40:48.669
Vanessa and I are taking Randall
to dinner, then we're going to church.

40:48.709 --> 40:51.613
–Why don't you join us?
–You trying to convert me now?

40:51.653 --> 40:53.377
No. It's been a long day…

40:53.574 --> 40:55.908
and you don't have to be alone.

40:56.998 --> 40:59.742
I haven't been to church
since I was, like, nine.

40:59.782 --> 41:03.492
–God remembers you.
–Yeah, well, I forgot about him.

41:06.823 --> 41:09.087
I put you on the Strike
Team. I know what you guys do.

41:09.127 --> 41:11.744
We don't take
any crap, if that's what you mean.

41:11.784 --> 41:14.144
Vic, come on.
The law doesn't apply to you.

41:14.184 --> 41:16.770
Look, out there,
it's not what you do.

41:17.193 --> 41:19.106
It's what they think you'll do.

41:19.146 --> 41:21.918
–So the beatings, frame-ups…
–Fairy tales.

41:21.993 --> 41:25.227
The assholes fear you,
they don't cross the line.

41:25.386 --> 41:27.432
Rep's everything on the street.

41:28.777 --> 41:30.981
Aceveda is right.

41:31.146 --> 41:33.986
His unit is clearing cases at a better
rate than anywhere in the city.

41:34.026 --> 41:36.611
You want me to bust up
that squad over crap like this?

41:36.651 --> 41:39.010
There are all kinds of irregularities.

41:39.050 --> 41:40.899
And Aceveda will be the one
to fall on the sword for it.

41:40.939 --> 41:44.107
–After the election, he's gone.
–Forget Aceveda.

41:44.235 --> 41:47.268
The Strike Team is at the center
of this shit-storm. Mackey's dirty.

41:47.308 --> 41:49.092
You haven't proven that
to my satisfaction.

41:49.132 --> 41:50.404
I would've had all the evidence…

41:50.444 --> 41:53.284
if someone hadn't stolen
my notes and tipped him off.

41:53.324 --> 41:55.964
That's between you
and the city council.

41:56.205 --> 41:58.598
Turn in your official report.
This is done.

41:58.638 --> 42:02.980
Frank, I want to see the budget
allocation numbers by 3:00 and…

42:04.909 --> 42:06.632
You can go, Ms Kellis.

42:09.709 --> 42:12.217
–What do you got for me, Bill?
–Chief…

42:15.407 --> 42:19.368
–You almost done?
–No.

42:21.135 --> 42:25.031
Logging this report is the only thing
keeping me from going home.

42:25.071 --> 42:27.657
Fascinating.

42:27.855 --> 42:31.336
–What are you doing?
–I'm E-mailing my daughters.

42:35.057 --> 42:37.129
Look, you better figure out
how much you hate me…

42:37.169 --> 42:39.545
and how you're gonna
deal with that…

42:39.633 --> 42:41.673
'cause I'm not going anywhere.

42:41.809 --> 42:43.598
Neither am I.

09:00:00.000 --> 09:00:01.000
