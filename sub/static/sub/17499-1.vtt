Our next guest, dubbed
"The Rocky Mountain Rambo,"

00:25.480 --> 00:27.789
got tired of waiting himself,
so he traveled to Pakistan.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.616
How close did you
actually get to bin Laden?

00:29.640 --> 00:31.198
Tonight with Gary Faulkner.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.016
This is
Gary Faulkner. Good luck.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.856
Gary is an adventurer
who set his sites

00:34.880 --> 00:36.016
- on hunting Osama bin Laden.
- Gary Faulkner

00:36.040 --> 00:37.473
made headlines for travelling

00:37.640 --> 00:40.359
to Pakistan
to capture Osama bin Laden.

00:43.240 --> 00:45.993
Dateline 2004.

00:46.120 --> 00:49.795
Land... the lawless,
tribal region of Pakistan.

00:49.920 --> 00:52.309
Our story concerns
Gary Faulkner,

00:52.440 --> 00:55.193
a part-time construction worker
with bad kidneys

00:55.320 --> 00:57.709
and a full-time
American patriot,

00:57.840 --> 01:00.752
who, after years of watching
the United States

01:00.880 --> 01:03.075
fruitlessly hunt
for Osama bin Laden,

01:03.200 --> 01:05.953
claimed he was visited by God

01:06.080 --> 01:09.868
and accepted a mission to find
and capture bin Laden himself.

01:16.480 --> 01:18.391
Armed with only a sword
and knife,

01:18.520 --> 01:21.159
Mr. Faulkner travelled to one
of the most dangerous places

01:21.280 --> 01:24.238
on the planet
to bring bin Laden to justice.

01:24.360 --> 01:26.715
Here I come!

01:26.840 --> 01:28.432
As strange
as it is compelling,

01:28.560 --> 01:30.551
this is a true story,

01:30.680 --> 01:33.353
or a story
that has truth in it,

01:33.480 --> 01:36.790
or maybe... elements of truth.

01:36.920 --> 01:40.276
Gee, pretty boy,
your time has come.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.958
The G has arrived.

01:42.120 --> 01:45.669
Like most stories,
ours began long ago,

01:45.800 --> 01:49.076
when the hero was but a boy.

02:10.160 --> 02:11.388
Take that, twerp.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.875
Don't come around here anymore.

02:18.440 --> 02:21.591
Hello, Gary.

02:21.720 --> 02:24.234
What ails you, my child?

02:24.360 --> 02:27.909
Did those heathen brutes
just burst your balloon?

02:28.080 --> 02:31.629
Children can be
real pricks sometimes.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.990
Gary, see that kid there?

02:34.120 --> 02:37.032
In a few years time,
the guilt he accumulates

02:37.160 --> 02:39.435
from committing this kind
of bullying will lead

02:39.560 --> 02:41.869
to him becoming a horrible
crystal meth addict,

02:42.000 --> 02:44.639
and he's gonna die
in a meth deal gone bad.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.593
Shit happens, Gary.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.472
Crying about it
don't do any good.

02:49.600 --> 02:53.434
But this, Gary...
this is your sword that

02:53.560 --> 02:57.394
I give onto thee,
and as long as you behold it,

02:57.520 --> 03:00.796
you need never fear any man.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.797
You are special.

03:02.920 --> 03:06.833
I choose you
to wield this sword,

03:06.960 --> 03:09.758
and as long as
it's in your possession,

03:09.880 --> 03:13.759
you need never know fear again.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.319
Hello?

03:43.440 --> 03:45.032
Hey, Gary, it's Pickles.

03:45.200 --> 03:48.078
Pickles, wow!
What's up, man?

03:48.200 --> 03:50.509
Glad you called,
I need a place to crash.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.119
I've been crashing
at the job site.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.151
Gary has been
described as everything

03:54.280 --> 03:56.316
from a hero to a crackpot.

03:56.440 --> 03:57.919
Dr. Jonathan Boudin

03:58.040 --> 04:00.270
of the Denver Clinic
for Psychiatric Care

04:00.400 --> 04:01.992
told us that Gary, quote,

04:02.120 --> 04:05.032
"does not suffer
from psychosis, paranoia,

04:05.160 --> 04:06.673
or schizophrenia."

04:06.800 --> 04:08.199
Clinically speaking,

04:08.320 --> 04:10.231
he's as sane as you or me.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.715
But you be the judge.

04:12.840 --> 04:14.592
Worst part of having this
bad kidney,

04:14.720 --> 04:16.119
getting dialysis
three times a week

04:16.240 --> 04:17.798
is they won't let me
eat chicken wings.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.070
Man, this country makes
the best goddamn chicken wings

04:20.200 --> 04:21.349
in the world.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.118
Now, I haven't seen
the whole world,

04:23.280 --> 04:25.669
I haven't tasted chicken wings
in Africa,

04:25.800 --> 04:28.792
but I'd be willing to bet the
right ball on a broke-dick dog

04:28.920 --> 04:31.150
that no place makes better wings
than they do here.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.280
Some other reasons America's
the best country ever,

04:33.360 --> 04:34.475
fastest cars.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.318
Now, some douche nugget
pointed out

04:36.440 --> 04:37.873
that the ltalians
and the Germans

04:38.000 --> 04:40.036
make faster rides on account
of their Ferraris,

04:40.160 --> 04:41.434
and their Mercedes.

04:41.560 --> 04:44.154
Well, I'm talking about
non-fascist automobiles.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.794
Also, I'm pretty sure
more people kick ass here

04:46.920 --> 04:48.319
than in any other country.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.556
I mean, some people claim
that you can't quantify

04:50.680 --> 04:52.318
kick-assedness.

04:52.440 --> 04:55.238
Those are usually people who's
asses have been recently kicked.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.237
What is crazy?
I mean, is crazy bad?

04:57.400 --> 04:59.595
Wasn't it crazy to believe
all men were created equal?

04:59.720 --> 05:01.576
Wasn't it crazy to
believe in life, liberty...

05:01.600 --> 05:02.953
From the first moment,

05:03.080 --> 05:05.310
Gary made clear
that he would not fit

05:05.440 --> 05:07.192
with anyone's expectations.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.276
And refused to believe
he was destined

05:09.400 --> 05:11.675
for anything other
than greatness.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.711
As he continually told those
around him,

05:13.840 --> 05:16.718
"You have to think crazy,
to accomplish crazy things."

05:16.840 --> 05:18.936
I don't know, but I once got
a fortune cookie that said,

05:18.960 --> 05:20.359
" In boldness,
there is greatness,"

05:20.480 --> 05:22.357
and I believe that fortune
cookie was correct.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.675
I can't stand foreign beer.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.616
Anybody that drinks foreign beer
or foreign whiskey

05:26.640 --> 05:28.296
should be shot as a traitor.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.176
- Come on.
- That's what we love about you, Gary, man.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.856
It's hard to be down around you.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.757
- I got to piss.
- Idiots!

05:33.880 --> 05:35.456
...reports that U.S. forces

05:35.480 --> 05:37.516
have been very close
to capturing bin Laden,

05:37.640 --> 05:40.234
but that was about
three years ago.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.868
We intend, fully intend,
to-to find him.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.037
We don't know
where Osama bin Laden, um, is.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.388
Government clowns.

05:47.520 --> 05:48.873
The hunt for bin Laden

05:49.000 --> 05:51.309
has been a cold well
for a long time.

05:51.440 --> 05:54.750
They're botching up the plan
to get bin Laden!

05:54.880 --> 05:57.235
Look, I know I'm a Leo,

05:57.360 --> 05:59.240
but it's easier for a mouse
to get into a castle

05:59.280 --> 06:00.508
than it is for a lion.

06:00.640 --> 06:02.437
I'd go in there,
and I'd boost that fucker

06:02.560 --> 06:04.336
right out from underneath their noses.

06:04.360 --> 06:06.351
Hey, buddy.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.391
You think you could do
a better job over there?

06:08.520 --> 06:09.669
Is that what you're saying?

06:09.800 --> 06:10.949
Oh, you're a Marine.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.752
- I am a Marine.
- Well, that's awesome.

06:12.880 --> 06:15.056
Listen, I really appreciate what
you boys are doing over there,

06:15.080 --> 06:16.560
and I understand
the price of freedom,

06:16.680 --> 06:18.113
the sacrifice, but look,

06:18.240 --> 06:20.280
you've got your program,
and I got mine, that's all.

06:20.320 --> 06:22.515
But l-let me buy you a drink.
What do you have?

06:22.640 --> 06:24.835
What are you gonna pay
for that with?

06:24.960 --> 06:26.109
Your unemployment check?

06:26.280 --> 06:27.713
Oh.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.513
Gary... Gary...

06:30.640 --> 06:31.755
Just let it go.

06:35.400 --> 06:38.312
Quick contest, Semper fi.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.856
Let's throw this knife
across the room

06:39.880 --> 06:41.279
over to that dart board.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.958
You get closest
to the bull's-eye,

06:43.080 --> 06:46.311
I'll buy everyone
in this bar a drink, okay?

06:46.440 --> 06:49.989
I get closest, you buy me
a drink and you apologize

06:50.120 --> 06:51.678
for being a dick.

06:54.680 --> 06:55.795
Yeah, you're on.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.432
Pretty good.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.656
Sometimes when people get close
to the bull's-eye,

07:08.680 --> 07:10.033
they get a little cocky.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.276
Sure hope that isn't gonna be
your problem.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.035
Yeah.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.068
Knight the kings.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.872
Oh!

07:21.040 --> 07:23.952
Goddamn it, Gary,
not again!

07:24.080 --> 07:26.674
The blade missed
most of Roy's tendons.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.096
And, like the previous
three times,

07:28.120 --> 07:30.350
he was soon back at the bar

07:30.480 --> 07:32.550
with little more
than a bruised ego.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.831
Why would you buy a showerhead

07:35.960 --> 07:38.554
from a country
that doesn't take showers?

07:40.480 --> 07:42.600
Don't buy that toilet,
that toilet was made in Africa.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.656
Pygmies made that toilet
and they take small shits.

07:44.680 --> 07:47.797
Your turd, your potty,
your poo, as it were,

07:47.920 --> 07:49.353
won't make it past the flusher.

07:49.480 --> 07:50.993
Yoo-hoo.

07:51.120 --> 07:53.076
No, seriously,
why would you buy a faucet

07:53.240 --> 07:56.198
from a country in the midst
of a drought?

07:56.320 --> 07:57.720
I don't know what
you're putting up,

07:57.760 --> 07:59.273
but that ain't gonna hold it.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.038
I want you to trust me

08:01.160 --> 08:03.176
because I'm probably the only
person in this whole store

08:03.200 --> 08:04.599
that'll tell you the truth.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.520
Now, if you need anything at
all, you call me.

08:06.560 --> 08:09.597
I'm Gary Faulkner,
your go-to handyman.

08:14.680 --> 08:15.715
Oh, what...

08:15.840 --> 08:17.319
Gary Faulkner.

08:17.440 --> 08:18.873
Marci Mitchell.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.558
Oh, my God!

08:20.680 --> 08:22.318
I cannot believe it!

08:22.480 --> 08:24.596
You look great.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.233
You look great.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.710
I had so many fantasies
about you in high school.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.336
I must've gone through
about 100 boxes of Kleenex.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.794
That is disgusting,
but I'll take it.

08:33.919 --> 08:36.717
- Why would you...
- Because I always had a crush on you.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.096
What've you been doing
all these years?

08:38.120 --> 08:39.837
Oh, my life is boring.

08:39.960 --> 08:41.438
Uh, you know...

08:41.559 --> 08:43.376
- went in and out of community college,
- Uh-huh.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.233
And then, you know, now I work
at The Olive Garden.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.510
Olive Garden, that's a great
restaurant. Well, good.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.790
- I answer phones at a dentist office.
- Uh-huh.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.496
- Calligraphy on the side.
- Calligraphy?

08:52.520 --> 08:54.120
For wedding invitations,
stuff like that.

08:54.240 --> 08:56.151
Dating only idiots.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.236
Uh, 'cause that...
those are the kinds of people

08:58.360 --> 09:00.794
- that can spend time with me, with my schedule.
- Uh-huh.

09:00.920 --> 09:02.576
- You know, losers that have nothing else to do.
- Yeah.

09:02.600 --> 09:03.600
Um...

09:03.680 --> 09:05.591
You remember my sister Carrie?

09:05.720 --> 09:08.518
Sure, yeah, she made you look
like a girl scout.

09:09.760 --> 09:12.354
Uh... well, she,
she passed away.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.038
And, uh, she OD'd

09:14.160 --> 09:16.594
in Colorado Springs,
like, eight years ago.

09:16.720 --> 09:19.598
Wow, that's...
I'm-I'm sorry, that's...

09:19.720 --> 09:21.840
- She got really bad into drugs and, uh..
- I'm sorry.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.109
Yeah.

09:23.240 --> 09:24.832
Had a kid with her dealer 'cause

09:25.000 --> 09:28.993
that's a... kind of stupid
decision you make, but, um...

09:29.120 --> 09:30.136
And what happened to the kid?

09:30.160 --> 09:31.593
I adopted her.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.472
- Oh.
- Lizzie, she's my little princess.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.512
She's, like... all I have
in the world, so...

09:36.640 --> 09:38.153
- Oh, that's awesome!
- Yeah.

09:38.280 --> 09:40.240
- I got to keep it together because of her.
- Wow.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.456
- And, uh, it's why I'm working three jobs, that I...
- Yeah.

09:42.480 --> 09:43.629
Hate.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.113
Well, I'll drink to that.

09:45.240 --> 09:46.640
Well, I don't
do that anymore, so...

09:46.760 --> 09:48.239
- No. Shit!
- I don't do that.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.954
Only making good decisions.

09:51.080 --> 09:53.150
Hey, listen, do you want
to get an ice cream sundae

09:53.320 --> 09:54.435
with me tonight?

09:54.560 --> 09:56.118
Let's have ice cream.

09:56.280 --> 09:57.395
- Great.
- Not tonight.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.192
- Okay.
- I can't do it tonight.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.356
- But tomorrow night?
- Great.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.119
We're gonna have ice cream,
but you have to find me.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.595
Listen, you still got
that awesome tattoo?

10:12.400 --> 10:13.879
Yes!

10:14.000 --> 10:15.228
I'll find you.

10:17.920 --> 10:21.833
They don't call me
the psychic wizard for nothing.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.760
In the past five years,

10:25.840 --> 10:27.512
it appears that Osama bin Laden

10:27.640 --> 10:29.153
and billions
of American dollars

10:29.280 --> 10:30.713
have all but disappeared

10:30.840 --> 10:32.990
into the mountains
of western Pakistan.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.560
I'm serious, Pickles, we
got to get on this immediately!

10:35.680 --> 10:37.750
No waiting, no hesitating!

10:37.880 --> 10:39.552
Got to get on this
right fucking now!

10:39.680 --> 10:41.238
What the fuck is going on, man?

10:41.360 --> 10:42.839
Did you see that shit?

10:42.960 --> 10:44.896
No, I didn't see... Gary, look,
listen to me, -What?

10:44.920 --> 10:46.876
You got to stop with
the noise, okay?

10:47.040 --> 10:48.268
We can't deal with it anymore,

10:48.400 --> 10:49.992
we can't sleep back there.

10:50.120 --> 10:50.916
You've been here
for three months.

10:51.040 --> 10:51.916
You got to get a job,

10:52.040 --> 10:53.256
you got to get out of here, man.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.480
W-What... so? I'm sorry, okay?

10:54.600 --> 10:55.720
I'll quiet down. What is it?

10:57.400 --> 10:59.595
I love you, but you got to
get out of here, man.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.354
- Oh!
- You got to go.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.520
You got to find a different
couch to sleep on, okay?

11:04.680 --> 11:07.148
- Come on.
- I'm sorry, I'll, uh...

11:07.280 --> 11:08.395
Well, look, I'll...

11:08.560 --> 11:09.675
let me just, uh...

11:09.800 --> 11:11.233
if I can just finish tonight...

11:11.360 --> 11:12.760
- Yeah, just...
- and I'll clean up.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.472
Yeah, just stay here tonight,
it's fine.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.496
Thank you, buddy. Okay. -She's
trying to sleep, all right?

11:16.520 --> 11:17.656
Hey, you remember what
tomorrow is, right?

11:17.680 --> 11:19.750
- What?
- Dialysis.

11:19.880 --> 11:20.676
- Oh, right, yeah.
- Dialysis, all right.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.677
Yeah, I remember now.
Thanks, Pickles.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.552
So, tomorrow you're out.

11:24.680 --> 11:26.989
It is said that on a cold day

11:27.160 --> 11:28.434
in Valley Forge,

11:28.560 --> 11:30.551
George Washington talked to God

11:30.680 --> 11:33.319
as young Americans died
on the battlefield.

11:33.440 --> 11:35.431
Abraham Lincoln
talked to God daily.

11:35.560 --> 11:38.711
But Gary did them one better.

11:40.120 --> 11:42.270
Hello, Gary.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.437
Holy shit.

11:45.560 --> 11:47.994
Yes, I take a holy shit
every day.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.314
God?

11:49.440 --> 11:50.998
Well, Gary, I have many names.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.554
But God's kind of catchy,
don't you think?

11:53.680 --> 11:56.592
But you're the one true God?
Who created the universe?

11:56.720 --> 11:58.199
Yeah, more or less,

11:58.360 --> 12:00.176
but let's not dwell on that
cosmic shit right now.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.758
I've got a favor
to ask you, Gary.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.598
A favor?

12:03.720 --> 12:05.576
A tiny, little favor that
I'd like you, Gary Faulkner,

12:05.600 --> 12:06.715
to do for me.

12:06.840 --> 12:07.955
Of course.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.433
I'm calling it a favor
to be compassionate,

12:12.560 --> 12:13.959
and kind, and nice.

12:14.080 --> 12:18.153
It's more like a command really.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.395
You understand?

12:19.520 --> 12:20.555
I do.

12:20.680 --> 12:21.908
Okay, cool.

12:22.040 --> 12:24.349
I need you to go over
to Pakistan

12:24.480 --> 12:27.597
and capture that son of a bitch
Osama bin Laden for me.

12:27.720 --> 12:28.914
OBL?

12:29.040 --> 12:30.439
He's got to be taken down.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.909
He pulled that 9/11 shit
and fucked me right over.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.190
Now he's got to pay the price.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.515
No one else seems
to be able to do it, Gary.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.232
And my patience
is getting wafer thin.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.153
Capture bin Laden?

12:42.320 --> 12:44.231
Capture him,
bring him back alive though.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.920
Remember, thou shall not kill.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.439
So we're good?

12:48.560 --> 12:50.736
You'll go to Pakistan and
capture Osama bin Laden for me.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.239
Perfect.

12:52.360 --> 12:54.430
Oh, just so you know, Gary,
this is probably it.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.710
I've got no plans
to ever speak to you again,

12:56.840 --> 12:58.512
but I am everywhere, you know?

12:58.640 --> 13:00.710
All knowing, all seeing.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.393
Which, by the way,
isn't as much fun

13:02.520 --> 13:04.192
as it's cracked up to be.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.749
Wait. What do you mean?

13:11.640 --> 13:13.153
Dr. Jones to ER.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.396
Dr. Jones to ER.

13:25.640 --> 13:29.394
Oh, my God.

13:29.520 --> 13:30.919
How did you find me?

13:31.080 --> 13:32.798
I don't want to say I'm psychic,

13:32.920 --> 13:34.194
but if the shoe fits.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.393
Well, get in here.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.016
Oh, I want
to introduce you to Lizzie.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.760
She's got some challenges.
She doesn't talk.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.233
Oh, yeah.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.056
Well, you know, everybody talks,

13:44.080 --> 13:46.096
but only the real smart ones
don't use their mouths,

13:46.120 --> 13:47.235
right, Lizzie?

13:47.360 --> 13:48.776
Oh, and you have got

13:48.800 --> 13:50.119
a killer smile.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.856
Which can be used both
as a friendly thing

13:51.880 --> 13:54.136
and also as a weapon, which I'm
sure you're already aware of.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.071
Nonetheless, it's great to
finally meet you.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.553
Lizzie...

13:57.680 --> 13:59.830
have you got a power animal?

13:59.960 --> 14:01.678
Like a spirit animal?

14:01.800 --> 14:02.994
Like a guide?
I'll bet you do.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.758
See, mine's the donkey.

14:04.880 --> 14:08.429
Now, my dad used to call me
a jackass when I was a kid.

14:08.560 --> 14:10.198
And at first I thought
it was an insult,

14:10.320 --> 14:11.799
and then I realized
it's a compliment

14:11.920 --> 14:13.751
because jackasses are true,
hardworking

14:13.880 --> 14:15.438
and loyal.

14:15.560 --> 14:16.913
Now, what's your power animal?

14:18.360 --> 14:19.395
Oh!

14:19.520 --> 14:20.873
The seagull, good choice!

14:21.000 --> 14:22.416
Butterscotch or chocolate?

14:22.440 --> 14:24.715
I'm a butterscotch man myself,

14:24.880 --> 14:26.438
but I can go either way.

14:26.560 --> 14:27.816
Just like to make sure
everybody's happy

14:27.840 --> 14:29.319
with the sundaes and stuff.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.670
Butterscotch, goddamn it!

14:31.800 --> 14:33.995
Looks like I'm having
chocolate again.

14:34.120 --> 14:37.510
And I think I remember you like
the mint chocolate chip.

14:37.640 --> 14:39.119
How the hell
did you remember that?

14:39.240 --> 14:40.798
Mind like a steel trap.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.799
You and Osama bin Laden?

14:44.920 --> 14:46.990
How does that work?
What-what's your plan?

14:47.120 --> 14:48.576
Well, okay, you see,
that right off the bat

14:48.600 --> 14:50.511
is a bit of a misnomer
'cause it's not my plan,

14:50.640 --> 14:51.834
it's God's plan.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.235
I didn't make the rules,
God did.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.839
But the plan is

14:55.960 --> 14:58.679
I'm thinking about buying a boat
and sailing to Pakistan...

14:58.800 --> 15:01.314
- "Sailing to Pakistan?"
- Yeah, I was gonna...

15:01.440 --> 15:03.136
go to San Diego, buy a boat,
sail to Pakistan,

15:03.160 --> 15:04.593
capture Osama bin Laden,

15:04.720 --> 15:06.496
bring him back to America
for justice and stuff.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.616
That's the plan... it's pretty
simple when you think about it.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.995
That's crazy.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.238
Sometimes,

15:14.360 --> 15:16.351
things are so sane

15:16.480 --> 15:19.472
they are beyond
our comprehension...

15:19.600 --> 15:21.113
Do you know anything
about sailing?

15:21.240 --> 15:22.798
Marci!

15:22.920 --> 15:24.273
You're so funny!

15:24.440 --> 15:27.113
The pirates did it,
the Pilgrims did it,

15:27.240 --> 15:29.276
and they weren't even
21 st century guys.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.356
I'm a 21 st century guy!

15:31.480 --> 15:34.711
Gary, boats are
very expensive, right?

15:34.840 --> 15:36.319
Do you have that kind of money?

15:36.440 --> 15:37.793
I got a little tucked away.

15:37.920 --> 15:39.638
You'd be surprised
how much you can save

15:39.760 --> 15:41.456
when you don't pay your bills
and you live on job sites.

15:41.480 --> 15:44.631
Uh, things get
particularly "traumaticals,"

15:44.760 --> 15:46.557
I can ask Dr. Ross,
who's my kidney doctor,

15:46.680 --> 15:47.936
and he always has
some money around

15:47.960 --> 15:49.678
to give to a worthy cause.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.400
And I'm thinking about taking
Roy and Pickles with me to Vegas

15:52.520 --> 15:54.351
to make a little
extra cash for my trip.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.276
You see, I'm doing this

15:58.400 --> 15:59.799
for people like you and Lizzie,

15:59.920 --> 16:02.639
to bring the fight
into his backyard,

16:02.760 --> 16:04.034
to bring the fight to him,

16:04.160 --> 16:06.833
so he doesn't come
into our backyard.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.473
Well, walk me through it.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.416
What are you gonna do,
just fight him and kill him?

16:10.440 --> 16:12.078
No, no, that would be too easy.

16:12.240 --> 16:13.719
And I was told to capture him.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.195
And I-I don't want
to kill anyone, anyway.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.515
I think I would just...
kill him,

16:18.640 --> 16:19.755
on the spot, you know?

16:19.880 --> 16:21.154
I mean, not face-to-face,

16:21.280 --> 16:22.696
I don't want to see him
face-to-face,

16:22.720 --> 16:24.153
but from far away, definitely.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.720
Yeah, well,
if it comes down to that,

16:25.800 --> 16:27.518
then I'll drop a gun
in front of him

16:27.640 --> 16:29.392
I'll drop a gun
in front of me,

16:29.520 --> 16:31.351
and we'll draw, fair and square,

16:31.480 --> 16:32.879
Old West style.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.216
Your ramp is a piece of shit.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.958
I know.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.435
I-I can't afford to have it
fixed right now, so...

16:46.560 --> 16:49.199
You and Lizzie...

16:49.360 --> 16:51.999
you deserve better.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.437
Good night, Gary.

16:57.560 --> 16:58.913
Night.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.395
Yah! Eh-yah-eh!

17:08.520 --> 17:11.079
Cha! Eh-yah-eh!

17:11.200 --> 17:12.553
Yah!

17:12.680 --> 17:13.829
What the fuck?

17:13.960 --> 17:15.075
You're awful pretty

17:15.200 --> 17:16.315
first thing in the morning.

17:16.440 --> 17:19.034
I consider that a positive sign!

17:19.160 --> 17:21.390
Well, you look like shit.

17:21.560 --> 17:22.913
And you got a sense of humor,

17:23.040 --> 17:24.996
'cause I know that's not true.

17:25.119 --> 17:26.473
Hey, listen.
These are my buddies,

17:26.599 --> 17:28.396
Roy...

17:28.520 --> 17:30.033
- Good morning.
- Pickles...

17:30.160 --> 17:31.856
- How are you?
- Two of the nicest dudes you'll ever meet.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.791
I... thank you

17:33.920 --> 17:35.035
for what you're doing,

17:35.160 --> 17:36.416
but, you know, it's really early

17:36.440 --> 17:37.720
and Lizzie's still asleep, so...

17:37.760 --> 17:39.016
Now, listen,
when we're finished,

17:39.040 --> 17:40.296
you're gonna have
a brand-new ramp

17:40.320 --> 17:41.639
and it's gonna be the envy

17:41.760 --> 17:43.336
of every crippled kid
in the neighborhood.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.816
We don't say "cripple."
She's challenged.

17:44.840 --> 17:46.717
Oh. You mean like us guys.

17:46.840 --> 17:48.671
Yeah.

17:48.800 --> 17:49.949
Um...

17:50.080 --> 17:51.399
Thank you.

17:51.520 --> 17:52.776
How much... how much
do I owe you for this?

17:52.800 --> 17:54.756
Marci Mitchell, not a dime.

17:54.880 --> 17:56.359
That little girl
deserves the best.

17:56.480 --> 17:59.153
But it might just cost you
a whole lot of love.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.632
Well, um...

18:02.760 --> 18:05.718
- I might be a little short this month.
- Ooh.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.478
See, now there's
that smile again.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.750
That smile is something

18:09.880 --> 18:11.160
I'm gonna be thinking
a lot about

18:11.240 --> 18:12.440
while I'm sailing to Pakistan.

18:12.520 --> 18:13.953
You are glowing,

18:14.080 --> 18:15.195
Marci Mitchell.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.032
You are radioactive.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.799
You are my lucky charm.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.276
I'm telling you, it was God.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.709
Like, Old Testament,
New Testament Lord on high.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.400
He came to my bedside
in the free clinic

18:29.480 --> 18:30.674
and he told me to do this.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.080
And I know you guys
are skeptics.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.314
Pickles, I know you're, like,

18:33.440 --> 18:35.476
quasi-Buddhist backslash
Senecan stoic,

18:35.600 --> 18:37.096
but I'm telling you it was God,
he spoke to me,

18:37.120 --> 18:38.712
and I gotta do this!

18:38.840 --> 18:40.068
Hey, man, we're not arguing.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.350
We love Vegas.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.056
Hey, Gary, we were wondering:
what did God look like?

18:44.080 --> 18:46.230
About how you'd imagine.
Maybe a little younger.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.096
That's weird, I always thought
he would've looked like

18:48.120 --> 18:49.553
Phil Donahue
or someone like that.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.016
I always thought
he'd be, like, a lion

18:51.040 --> 18:52.376
with, like,
James Earl Jones' voice.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.549
Mm, that's cool.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.193
Hey, what did God say
we should play?

18:55.360 --> 18:56.634
You play whatever you want.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.320
This is God's house,
it's like a church.

18:58.360 --> 18:59.475
We can't lose.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.718
Come on, red!

19:02.840 --> 19:04.876
Oh!

19:08.880 --> 19:10.313
- Go.
- Let 'em come.

19:13.160 --> 19:15.116
Oh!

19:18.440 --> 19:20.237
Uh...

19:20.360 --> 19:21.839
I don't know, I think...

19:21.960 --> 19:23.560
I'm all right.
I'm all right right there.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.456
- No. Gary, come on.
- No, no, no. No, no. Don't do it.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.675
Oh! Oh!

19:27.800 --> 19:29.313
You did it!

19:29.440 --> 19:31.590
He's my friend.
He is my friend.

19:31.720 --> 19:32.835
- And he is lucky.
- Hey.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.279
Are you smoking marijuana?

19:34.440 --> 19:36.032
No shit, Einstein.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.680
You think I might be
smoking some weed?

19:37.760 --> 19:38.976
Uh, you need to put
that out right now

19:39.000 --> 19:40.433
or we're gonna call the cops.

19:40.560 --> 19:43.597
Oh, you're gonna call the cops
on The G.

19:46.240 --> 19:48.310
All right.
Don't be a buzzkill.

19:48.440 --> 19:49.555
Get out of my sight.

20:08.080 --> 20:12.039
Man, I been seeing
you shitheads all night.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.559
What the holy hell do you want?

20:16.640 --> 20:18.995
What do a bunch of
Columbian drug lords

20:19.120 --> 20:21.031
care about Al-Qaeda anyway?

20:27.800 --> 20:28.994
Yeah, right.

20:29.160 --> 20:32.072
This ain't my first rodeo,
hombre.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.517
And what if I don't?

20:53.640 --> 20:54.993
Ow!

20:55.120 --> 20:56.599
Hey, man...

20:58.360 --> 20:59.839
Ow!

21:22.120 --> 21:25.112
Those Columbians stole
all my money!

21:25.240 --> 21:26.673
Wait, wait, wait.
What Columbians?

21:26.800 --> 21:28.472
The drug ones!

21:28.640 --> 21:30.039
What are you talking about, man?

21:30.160 --> 21:31.920
You lost your money
at the tables last night.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.296
Yeah, man, you should've quit
while were you ahead.

21:33.320 --> 21:35.595
- You fucked up.
- No!

21:35.720 --> 21:37.176
You guys want to hit
the breakfast buffet?

21:37.200 --> 21:39.270
Ah!

21:40.480 --> 21:41.754
Nurse Taylor,

21:41.880 --> 21:43.472
how is Dr. Ross today?

21:43.600 --> 21:45.955
Is he feeling in a good mood?
He's happy?

21:46.080 --> 21:47.274
- Chipper?
- Oh, yeah.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.833
- Oh, good.
- It's a golf day.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.109
Yes. Golf day, yes.

21:51.640 --> 21:52.856
Everything's looking good, Gary.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.029
Excellent.

21:54.160 --> 21:55.434
- Gary!
- Dr. Ross, hi.

21:55.560 --> 21:56.840
How you feeling?
Good to see you.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.056
- Yeah, you, too.
- How have you been feeling?

21:58.080 --> 21:59.354
Uh, yeah, good.

21:59.480 --> 22:01.516
Good. Listen, uh...
Nurse Taylor, is...

22:01.640 --> 22:03.198
Dr. Ross, is it okay
if I just, uh,

22:03.320 --> 22:04.856
- talk with you in private for a minute?
- Absolutely.

22:04.880 --> 22:05.995
Oh, thank you.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.439
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.896
I can't believe
you're still alive.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.273
Your blood work is amazing.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.436
Thank you so...
Well, it's because of you.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.079
You and your care for me.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.156
You've kept me afloat
with my kidney problem,

22:16.280 --> 22:18.430
you helped me with my
pre-dialysis hallucinations...

22:18.560 --> 22:20.016
The other thing I want to say
to you, Dr. Ross...

22:20.040 --> 22:22.156
in many ways, I feel like
you're a brother to me.

22:22.280 --> 22:24.120
- Thank you.
- I really care so much about you.

22:24.160 --> 22:26.435
Because you care.
You're a good man.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.790
You're a charitable man.
And you care about

22:28.920 --> 22:30.638
what's going on in our country.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.398
I've got a charity

22:32.520 --> 22:35.080
- that I would like to maybe ask you to invest in.
- Okay.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.376
- All right.
- 'Cause I know you take that stuff seriously.

22:37.400 --> 22:40.233
I'm going to sail to Pakistan.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.271
I'm gonna capture
Osama bin Laden

22:42.400 --> 22:43.976
and bring him back to America
for justice and stuff,

22:44.000 --> 22:45.216
- 'cause I think...
- I'm sorry,

22:45.240 --> 22:46.355
say that again?

22:46.480 --> 22:47.959
I'm gonna go get Osama bin Laden

22:48.080 --> 22:49.479
out of Pakistan and I want

22:49.600 --> 22:51.431
to keep you safe, I want to keep

22:51.560 --> 22:53.755
America safe and, frankly,
I want to keep me safe.

22:53.880 --> 22:55.816
- What are you talking about?
- What I'm talking about

22:55.840 --> 22:57.592
is that I-I-I-I'm gonna
buy a sailboat

22:57.720 --> 23:00.240
and I thought maybe... 'cause my
dance card is a little light...

23:00.360 --> 23:02.590
that maybe you could
loan me a thousand bucks,

23:02.720 --> 23:04.358
because I-I don't,
it's a little light,

23:04.480 --> 23:06.118
and I'll pay you back,
$250 a week,

23:06.240 --> 23:09.437
and then we can take care of
this Al-Qaeda issue together.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.630
- A sailboat.
- Yeah, to go to Pakistan

23:11.760 --> 23:13.716
to capture, uh, bin Laden.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.400
What do you really
want the money for?

23:17.800 --> 23:19.199
Are you in some kind of trouble?

23:19.320 --> 23:20.514
Oh...

23:20.640 --> 23:21.755
I lied.

23:21.920 --> 23:23.592
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.

23:23.720 --> 23:25.039
That's a crazy story.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.376
I mean, how can you sail
a boat to Pakistan?

23:26.400 --> 23:27.913
I mean, if you stop dialysis,

23:28.040 --> 23:29.296
you're gonna start
hallucinating.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.435
No, uh...

23:30.560 --> 23:32.232
Uh, I...

23:32.360 --> 23:33.475
Oh, it's humiliating.

23:33.640 --> 23:35.710
Dr. Ross...

23:35.840 --> 23:37.990
there's a girl I-I really love.

23:38.120 --> 23:40.998
And, uh, I can't afford
the engagement ring.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.519
There's one
for a thousand bucks,

23:42.640 --> 23:44.120
and I wanted to get her
a diamond ring

23:44.240 --> 23:46.390
so that I could get engaged.

23:50.520 --> 23:51.635
Okay.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.671
Oh, bless your heart, Dr. Ross.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.030
- Y-You're telling me the truth now?
- Absolutely.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.776
You're not gonna get on a boat
and sail to Pakistan?

23:57.800 --> 23:59.233
No.

23:59.360 --> 24:00.429
Osama bin Laden.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.391
Me? Look at me. Wrong.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.715
- I got dialysis problems.
- Yeah, that's why

24:04.880 --> 24:06.336
I was wondering,
how would you do dialysis

24:06.360 --> 24:08.078
if you were on a boat
sailing to Pakistan?

24:08.200 --> 24:09.416
- I couldn't do it.
- You couldn't do it.

24:09.440 --> 24:10.839
I wouldn't be able do it, man.

24:10.960 --> 24:12.279
I'll go get my checkbook.

24:12.400 --> 24:15.039
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah!

24:15.160 --> 24:16.275
Yeah!

24:26.400 --> 24:28.675
Hey, man, I don't want to...
I don't want to be that guy,

24:28.800 --> 24:30.518
but, um...

24:30.640 --> 24:32.676
I'm pretty sure
you can't sail to Pakistan.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.951
Yeah, well, they told George
Washington the same thing.

24:36.080 --> 24:37.638
They told
George Washington he...

24:37.760 --> 24:39.520
I-I'm pretty sure
they told George Washington

24:39.600 --> 24:41.176
he couldn't cut down
a tree or something.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.760
It's just a figure of speech.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.598
Look, I'm just saying,
dude, like,

24:45.720 --> 24:47.073
have you looked at a globe?

24:47.200 --> 24:49.316
- It's kind of a long way to go...
- Ah.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.032
- ...in a boat.
- Ah. Ah.

24:51.160 --> 24:52.816
You know, you can do it, too,
that-that's...

24:52.840 --> 24:54.432
you can...
you can do a lot of stuff

24:54.560 --> 24:55.709
if you just kind of...

24:55.840 --> 24:57.159
Hey, you know, can I...?

24:57.280 --> 24:58.696
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
hey, hey, hey, thanks.

24:58.720 --> 25:00.597
- So are these mussels?
- Yeah, man.

25:00.720 --> 25:03.029
So, I... they're not eating
fish poo on the ground, right?

25:03.160 --> 25:05.674
- No.
- Like the crabs and the oysters eat the fish shit?

25:05.800 --> 25:07.616
- Yeah, yeah.
- So these are eating, what, krill? Kelp? What?

25:07.640 --> 25:10.552
Yeah. Like, fallity
of the ocean stuff.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.296
- Ah, so fresh stuff, live stuff. So...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:12.320 --> 25:14.311
- Like, healthy stuff.
- I could eat that, right?

25:14.440 --> 25:16.192
You could do, like,
a soup or something?

25:16.320 --> 25:17.656
- A broth, a bouillabaisse?
- Yeah.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.318
- Good eatin'.
- So do I need to get...

25:19.440 --> 25:20.816
Maybe do you have,
like, some scuba gear...

25:20.840 --> 25:22.376
...or, like, a snorkel and shit

25:22.400 --> 25:23.856
so I can get off the boat
and scrape those off

25:23.880 --> 25:25.677
and then eat 'em
while I'm sailing?

25:25.800 --> 25:27.936
- 'Cause it's a long trip.
- Just grab some, like, goggles

25:27.960 --> 25:29.720
- and a snorkel and you're good, man.
- Okay.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.116
Yeah, I got him. Yeah.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.553
Morning, sir!

25:41.680 --> 25:42.795
- Hi.
- How you doing today?

25:42.920 --> 25:44.592
- Good.
- Good!

25:44.720 --> 25:47.553
You know, you're parked in,
uh, someone else's slip.

25:47.680 --> 25:48.795
What do you mean by "slip"?

25:48.920 --> 25:50.399
- Slip.
- A slip.

25:50.520 --> 25:52.750
Yeah, I saw an empty
parking space and I took it.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.711
Last time I checked,
this was still America.

25:54.840 --> 25:56.319
Yeah, it's not a parking lot.

25:56.440 --> 25:57.555
It's a harbor.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.636
- Uh-huh.
- All of these boats you see,

25:59.760 --> 26:02.274
they're all registered to people
who own these slips.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.834
Okay, officer...
madam... Super Cop,

26:05.000 --> 26:06.877
whatever your name is,
do you know who I am?

26:07.040 --> 26:09.315
Yeah. I'm Gary Faulkner,

26:09.440 --> 26:10.856
and I'm trying to do something
very important here, okay?

26:10.880 --> 26:11.995
I'm trying to protect you.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.076
I'm trying to go to Pakistan

26:14.200 --> 26:15.256
so I can capture
Osama bin Laden.

26:15.280 --> 26:16.793
I'm gonna bring him to justice.

26:16.920 --> 26:18.536
And I think you're...
you're kind of impinging

26:18.560 --> 26:20.437
on important duty right now.

26:20.560 --> 26:22.152
Pakistan's a long way
away, sir.

26:22.280 --> 26:24.157
I am fully aware of it, so if...

26:24.280 --> 26:25.872
The sooner you let me
do my business,

26:26.000 --> 26:27.228
the sooner I can protect you.

26:27.360 --> 26:28.998
You prepared for this trip?

26:29.120 --> 26:30.776
- You got a life preserver?
- No, I do not have

26:30.800 --> 26:32.200
- a life preserver.
- Safety flares.

26:32.240 --> 26:33.673
I do not have safety flares.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.336
- First aid kit?
- I do not have a first aid kit.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.475
In fact, I've never...

26:36.600 --> 26:37.715
Any working knowledge

26:37.840 --> 26:39.034
of how to operate a sailboat?

26:39.200 --> 26:40.599
I have never sailed before.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.039
Which is why I broke my arm,

26:42.200 --> 26:44.191
because I was trying
to higher up the sail.

26:44.320 --> 26:45.514
I was trying to higher it up.

26:45.640 --> 26:48.279
I was trying to raise it.
Hoist it.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.470
Okay.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.033
Um...

26:52.160 --> 26:54.390
- gonna get you to hang tight.
- Very good.

26:54.520 --> 26:55.920
- I'm gonna be right back.
- Dig it!

26:56.040 --> 26:57.678
- Okay.
- All right.

26:57.840 --> 27:00.016
I need... I need you
to come down here right now.

27:14.640 --> 27:17.632
Okay, clowns!

27:17.760 --> 27:19.796
Doubters, doubters!

27:19.920 --> 27:21.353
Debbie Doubters!

27:21.480 --> 27:23.516
Looks like I'm still sailing!

27:23.640 --> 27:26.108
And you know why
I'm still sailing?

27:26.240 --> 27:29.073
Because it is not my will,

27:29.200 --> 27:30.679
it's God's will.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.438
Shit!

27:42.080 --> 27:44.435
Is this Pakistan?

27:44.560 --> 27:45.754
No, señor.

27:47.680 --> 27:49.750
Not knowing how to sail
turned out to be

27:49.880 --> 27:51.916
a bigger liability
than I originally thought,

27:52.040 --> 27:54.873
but boy,
Mexico sure is beautiful.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.116
And... to that effect,

27:57.240 --> 27:59.708
on the beach of Mexico,

27:59.840 --> 28:02.070
I found this for you.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.959
I thought you might like
to use it as a hairbrush.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.394
And then, this shell...

28:06.520 --> 28:07.635
Isn't that something?

28:07.760 --> 28:10.115
It looks like a pyramid.

28:10.240 --> 28:13.550
And then this is
the venomous cone shell.

28:13.680 --> 28:15.591
Now, this animal
is very powerful.

28:15.720 --> 28:17.233
It shoots a poison dart out...

28:17.360 --> 28:19.237
Bam! Right there,
you're dead in two seconds.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.237
Glad I didn't get hit with that.

28:21.360 --> 28:23.510
And this one looks like
a spiral staircase.

28:23.680 --> 28:26.194
Now, I want to make a spiral
staircase for you one day.

28:26.320 --> 28:27.936
You can have it and
it'll be made out of oak.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.791
Oh.

28:29.920 --> 28:31.831
Yeah. And I got
something for you.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.154
♪ Dah-dah-dah-dah! ♪

28:35.040 --> 28:36.792
San Diego, huh?

28:38.720 --> 28:41.712
- Oh, well, thank you for thinking of me.
- You're welcome.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.990
- I'm glad you're okay.
- I'm always okay.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.315
Well, you know, I'm just
thinking about the dialysis.

28:46.440 --> 28:47.536
Don't you have to go
in for dialysis on your kidney

28:47.560 --> 28:49.596
a couple times a week?

28:49.720 --> 28:52.473
First of all,
the good Lord protects his

28:52.600 --> 28:55.239
sacred warriors,
that's first of all.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.590
I forget second of all.

28:57.720 --> 29:00.678
Well, you had us worried,
you asshole.

29:02.120 --> 29:03.997
I'm sorry.

29:04.120 --> 29:05.678
I'll put a quarter in the jar.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.360
Well, thank you, ladies,
thank you both.

29:07.480 --> 29:09.755
I'm so glad to be back home
with you two.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.398
I really love that little girl.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.397
That-that child is amazing.

29:21.520 --> 29:22.919
And she just took to you.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.713
I've never seen her do that
with somebody.

29:25.840 --> 29:28.479
I don't usually let people
get close to her so quickly.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.376
I mean, you're the first guy
I've had in the house

29:30.400 --> 29:31.913
since I broke up with my ex.

29:32.080 --> 29:33.513
I appreciate that.

29:33.640 --> 29:35.437
I'd do anything for her.

29:35.560 --> 29:36.675
I'd do anything for you.

29:36.800 --> 29:39.234
You can count on me.

29:39.360 --> 29:40.918
I'm not just saying that.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.679
Well, I-I am just saying that,
but I-I mean it.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.637
I'm glad you're here.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.552
I like being here.

29:47.720 --> 29:49.756
Are you seeing anyone right now?

29:51.160 --> 29:52.388
No.

29:54.200 --> 29:58.193
I... broke up with someone
a year ago and... eh.

29:58.320 --> 30:00.880
It's-it's been almost
three years for me.

30:03.160 --> 30:05.071
Huh.

30:05.240 --> 30:06.719
You're-you're such a stud.

30:06.840 --> 30:08.273
I figured you'd have, like,

30:08.400 --> 30:10.675
girls all over the place,
hidden around and...

30:10.800 --> 30:12.472
No, see that-that's just hype.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.352
See, the thing is...

30:14.480 --> 30:17.040
I'm-I'm picky.

30:17.160 --> 30:18.559
No, well, I...

30:18.680 --> 30:20.193
I'm overcompensating, see?

30:20.320 --> 30:23.551
'Cause I-I-I don't feel
like that, all that, you know?

30:23.680 --> 30:25.113
And I've-I've had some issues

30:25.240 --> 30:26.514
'cause of the way I talk.

30:26.640 --> 30:28.710
And sometimes the way
I-I look you know?

30:28.840 --> 30:30.558
I... so I haven't felt
very confident,

30:30.720 --> 30:32.756
but-but I am feeling
something with you.

30:32.880 --> 30:34.711
I'm feeling some
connection with you

30:34.840 --> 30:36.432
and I really...

30:36.600 --> 30:37.999
I really like you, Marci.

30:43.280 --> 30:44.599
Oh, I'm blushing.

30:44.720 --> 30:46.995
I feel like
I'm in high school.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.838
Me too.

30:48.960 --> 30:50.279
Can I kiss you?

30:50.400 --> 30:51.799
You...

30:51.920 --> 30:53.717
What a gentleman.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.239
Yeah.

31:02.440 --> 31:05.512
I barely even remember
how to do this.

31:05.640 --> 31:08.791
You want to go upstairs
and try and remember?

31:13.960 --> 31:15.632
Remember Osama bin Laden?

31:15.760 --> 31:17.920
Public enemy number one,
we got to get Osama bin Laden.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.560
The fact that we can't find him
is a big deal, folks, all right?

31:20.600 --> 31:22.079
He's tethered
to a dialysis machine

31:22.200 --> 31:23.936
that he somehow drags around
from recording session

31:23.960 --> 31:25.536
to recording session.

31:25.560 --> 31:26.976
You know, that-that's
got to leave some sort of

31:27.000 --> 31:28.752
trail in sand,
can't we track that down?

31:28.880 --> 31:30.360
Osama bin Laden.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.550
- You know where he is.
- Definitely.

31:32.680 --> 31:33.736
Because he dumped some woman.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.352
Welcome to Books 'n Shit.

31:35.480 --> 31:36.560
So you have a new book out.

31:36.680 --> 31:38.056
- Congratulations by the way.
- Thank you.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.513
Um, it's called
The New Testament.

31:39.640 --> 31:41.136
- The New Testament.
- The New Testament.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.195
It's a sequel of sorts

31:42.320 --> 31:43.514
to the original, um...

31:43.640 --> 31:45.392
- The Old Testament.
- The Old Testament.

31:45.520 --> 31:46.953
Um, is there a movie
in the works?

31:47.080 --> 31:51.312
We are working on a movie,
uh, with James Cameron.

31:51.440 --> 31:52.589
He's great.

31:52.760 --> 31:54.273
Yeah, I mean,
the guy's confident.

31:57.120 --> 31:59.200
You can't buy it in a store,
you can't buy it online,

31:59.280 --> 32:01.032
you can't buy it tomorrow.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.736
This sweet little thing
is limited to one.

32:02.760 --> 32:04.432
This one, the only one.

32:04.560 --> 32:05.834
Are you listening to me, Gary?

32:05.960 --> 32:07.439
This is Excalibur

32:07.560 --> 32:09.676
brought back to life,
this is Damocles fallen.

32:09.800 --> 32:11.791
This item is available
for a penny.

32:11.920 --> 32:14.798
A tiny, brown, copper sphincter
of nothingness.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.239
Gary? Focus.

32:16.360 --> 32:18.160
We're talking about destiny, Gary.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.355
Carpe diem,

32:19.480 --> 32:21.436
seize the day, seize the moment,

32:21.560 --> 32:22.675
take the blade.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.996
Hi-yah!

32:29.120 --> 32:31.554
Marci, I've been going
about this all wrong.

32:31.680 --> 32:33.875
You know what I'm gonna do now?
I'm gonna change it up.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.479
I'm gonna hang glide
into Pakistan.

32:35.640 --> 32:37.153
Well, that sounds dangerous.

32:37.280 --> 32:39.236
Huy-des!

32:39.360 --> 32:41.635
That's okay, everything about
this mission is dangerous.

32:41.760 --> 32:42.976
Do you even know
how to hang glide?

32:43.000 --> 32:45.070
- No, but I got a plan.
- What plan?

32:45.200 --> 32:47.395
Israel.

32:47.520 --> 32:49.456
I'm gonna go to a mountain in
lsrael and I'm gonna jump off.

32:49.480 --> 32:50.754
If I fly, I fly into Pakistan.

32:50.880 --> 32:52.472
If I crash, I crash
into the Dead Sea,

32:52.600 --> 32:54.576
which is the deepest
hypersaline lake in the world.

32:54.600 --> 32:57.558
Yeah, they about 34% salinity
over there and stuff.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.800
Just about the saltiest
body of water you'll ever see.

32:59.880 --> 33:01.736
So everything, no matter
how heavy, floats on it.

33:01.760 --> 33:03.176
So, if I crash, I'll float,
which is good

33:03.200 --> 33:04.952
because I-I don't know
how to swim.

33:05.080 --> 33:07.514
- No, that's a terrible idea.
- Marci,

33:07.640 --> 33:10.791
every good idea sounded terrible
at first. Think about it.

33:10.920 --> 33:13.434
Binny boy won't be expecting it,
that's the main thing.

33:13.560 --> 33:15.120
You got to have
the element of surprise.

33:15.200 --> 33:18.317
And the other thing
you got to add is... a sword!

33:18.440 --> 33:20.158
Chi-yas!

33:20.280 --> 33:21.395
You know what?

33:21.560 --> 33:22.675
I'm rude, look at me.

33:22.800 --> 33:23.994
Hogging all the fun.

33:24.120 --> 33:25.480
Come on, let me
show you something.

33:25.560 --> 33:27.994
- Oh...
- Marci, come on. Look at this.

33:28.120 --> 33:29.269
- Okay, turn around.
- Okay.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.192
- Now, hold it in your hand.
- Okay.

33:31.360 --> 33:33.271
Feel the weight,
respect it, respect it.

33:33.400 --> 33:36.073
Now, I want you to just go down
like that, okay?

33:36.240 --> 33:37.514
Mm-hmm. Right.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.596
Okay, now, when I toss it,

33:39.720 --> 33:41.233
you slice it, slice and dice it.

33:41.360 --> 33:42.520
All right, so, let's do this.

33:42.600 --> 33:43.828
Okay, here we go.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
And...

33:45.080 --> 33:47.548
A five, six, seven, eight.

33:47.680 --> 33:50.831
Ah-ha, you did it! Yay!

33:50.960 --> 33:52.360
I see why you like this.

34:24.719 --> 34:26.551
- You work here?
- Yeah.

34:26.679 --> 34:29.069
Okay, listen, I'm looking
to buy a hang glider.

34:29.199 --> 34:30.792
- Okay.
- 'Cause I'm gonna hang glide

34:30.960 --> 34:32.598
- from a mountain in lsrael
- Okay.

34:32.719 --> 34:34.760
To Pakistan, 'cause I got to
capture Osama bin Laden

34:34.840 --> 34:36.353
and pull him right out
of his cave.

34:36.480 --> 34:38.311
- That's quite the adventure.
- That's right.

34:38.440 --> 34:41.112
- But I need a hang glider.
- Well, the North Wing, uh,

34:41.239 --> 34:43.719
- she is a sweet, sweet bird, yeah.
- I like that. Sounds good.

34:43.760 --> 34:45.318
"Sweet bird's" what I like.

34:45.440 --> 34:47.635
- Now, I was gonna take a boom box,
- Okay.

34:47.760 --> 34:50.513
Hang it, dangle it,
from the hang glider.

34:50.639 --> 34:54.713
Listen to music to inspire me,
to motivate me for my mission.

34:54.840 --> 34:57.832
What sort of music
would you suggest

34:57.960 --> 34:59.951
would be the best music
to hang glide to?

35:00.080 --> 35:02.514
Okay, well, I wouldn't hang
a boom box from the wing

35:02.640 --> 35:04.320
'cause you're gonna throw off
your balance.

35:04.440 --> 35:06.431
You got to spare me
the physics lesson

35:06.560 --> 35:08.039
and just answer the question.

35:08.160 --> 35:11.277
Okay, uh, so you're looking
for some, like, pump-up,

35:11.400 --> 35:13.675
- inspirational, kind of...
- That's right.

35:13.840 --> 35:14.955
Tom Petty?

35:15.080 --> 35:16.433
Stupidest thing I've ever heard.

35:16.560 --> 35:17.993
- Okay.
- Okay?

35:18.120 --> 35:20.793
Now, listen, if I was gonna
cut that up into pieces,

35:20.920 --> 35:22.672
'cause I got to get it
into my luggage

35:22.800 --> 35:24.233
to get it over to lsrael.

35:24.360 --> 35:27.272
How many pieces would I
cut it into? Three? Four? Five?

35:27.400 --> 35:29.755
Well, the-the thing about
a hang glider

35:29.880 --> 35:31.996
is it-it's all, uh,
one piece.

35:32.120 --> 35:33.269
You can't cut it up.

35:33.440 --> 35:35.635
Son...

35:35.760 --> 35:36.875
I can do anything.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.797
I am Gary Faulkner.

35:38.920 --> 35:40.990
I am the Donkey King.

35:42.600 --> 35:44.431
Wow.

35:53.120 --> 35:55.680
Sir, that is a samurai sword.

35:55.840 --> 35:57.353
Uh, you cannot take that
on the plane.

35:57.480 --> 35:59.357
No, listen, you don't
understand,

35:59.480 --> 36:02.199
I need this sword
to do what I have to do.

36:02.320 --> 36:04.436
You trying to get my killed
by Al-Qaeda?

36:04.560 --> 36:06.152
Is that, is that what you want?

36:06.280 --> 36:08.794
No, I want you to realize
that you cannot take a sword

36:08.920 --> 36:10.069
onto an airplane.

36:10.200 --> 36:11.872
Can't.
If there weren't people like me

36:12.000 --> 36:13.280
doing things that
people like you

36:13.440 --> 36:14.839
told us that we couldn't do,

36:14.960 --> 36:16.416
then nothing great
would ever get done

36:16.440 --> 36:18.078
and America wouldn't be awesome.

36:18.200 --> 36:19.918
And let me tell you
something, lady,

36:20.040 --> 36:24.272
we may have our flaws,
but America is awesome!

36:24.400 --> 36:26.550
You cannot carry the sword
onto the plane.

36:26.680 --> 36:29.558
Tell that to George Washington!

36:29.680 --> 36:30.829
Gary!

36:31.000 --> 36:32.638
Pack the sword.

36:32.760 --> 36:34.990
Yes, my Lord.

36:50.080 --> 36:53.072
You guys seem like
a couple of nice kids.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.077
Where you from?
Are you from lsrael?

36:56.440 --> 36:58.715
You're from one of
the other, uh,

36:58.840 --> 37:01.479
Middle Eastern, uh, countries,
or Pakistan,

37:01.600 --> 37:03.670
or, uh, Tunisia?

37:05.400 --> 37:06.992
All right, well, I'm gonna...

37:07.160 --> 37:08.957
I'm gonna start running now.

37:09.120 --> 37:11.111
I'm gonna pick it up,
and I'm gonna run.

37:11.240 --> 37:13.708
Okay?
You got to get out so I can run.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.869
Let's go.
Go, go, go!

37:25.000 --> 37:27.639
Ha-ha!
Success!

37:29.600 --> 37:31.989
Look at me now!

37:32.120 --> 37:33.678
No!

37:33.800 --> 37:36.872
Shit! Fuck! Goddamn it! You fucker!

37:37.000 --> 37:39.753
As Gary lay broken on
the rocky terrain of Israel...

37:39.880 --> 37:40.995
Fuck it!

37:41.120 --> 37:42.712
...doubt crept in.

37:42.840 --> 37:45.991
And perhaps
a small voice asked,

37:46.120 --> 37:47.872
"I wonder if Marci is serving

37:48.000 --> 37:50.150
her guacamole
and chips tonight."

37:50.280 --> 37:51.508
Gare-bear.

37:51.640 --> 37:53.119
Hey, babe.

37:53.240 --> 37:56.152
Look at you,
having a little spa day, huh?

37:56.280 --> 37:59.352
Thanks. Thank you so much for
letting me crash here again.

37:59.480 --> 38:01.391
Oh, no problem.
Lizzie, uh...

38:01.520 --> 38:03.351
Well, you know,

38:03.480 --> 38:06.711
Lizzie and I love
having you here, so...

38:06.840 --> 38:08.956
Would you look at me?
I'm as crippled as Lizzie is.

38:09.080 --> 38:13.039
Well, I mean, she's a...

38:13.160 --> 38:15.594
ten-year-old girl
with cerebral palsy,

38:15.720 --> 38:18.712
and you are a grown man who
jumped off a cliff on purpose.

38:18.840 --> 38:21.274
- I retract my previous statement.
- Yeah.

38:21.440 --> 38:23.954
Where is she anyway? You know,
I got a present for her.

38:24.080 --> 38:25.280
Oh, she's at physical therapy.

38:25.360 --> 38:26.640
I'm gonna go get her in an hour.

38:26.760 --> 38:28.955
Okay, well, listen,
check this out.

38:29.080 --> 38:32.038
You can buy the shit
out of these things in lsrael.

38:32.200 --> 38:33.952
That's water
from the fucking Jordan river.

38:34.120 --> 38:36.429
That's the fucking river where
fucking Jesus was baptized.

38:36.560 --> 38:37.595
She's gonna love this.

38:37.720 --> 38:38.835
Yeah.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.592
That was so thoughtful.

38:40.720 --> 38:41.869
Thank you.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.230
I got you something too.

38:44.360 --> 38:46.510
Yeah, look how beautiful
that is.

38:50.600 --> 38:52.352
- "Israel rocks."
- Yeah.

38:52.480 --> 38:54.436
Yeah, it does.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.034
God, Gary, thanks.

38:57.160 --> 39:00.436
Why did I sit there and let you
take that glider apart?

39:00.560 --> 39:01.834
- The hang glider?
- Yeah.

39:01.960 --> 39:03.075
That was a lemon.

39:03.200 --> 39:05.236
Hey.

39:05.400 --> 39:09.075
Do you want to get behind
some hedges and, uh, you know,

39:09.240 --> 39:10.355
show me your tattoo again?

39:10.480 --> 39:11.708
Uh-huh?

39:11.840 --> 39:12.875
Uh-huh?

39:13.000 --> 39:14.228
You are a little horn dog.

39:14.360 --> 39:17.432
- Even all banged up like this.
- Yeah.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.120
I don't know, it ain't just
animal lust,

39:19.240 --> 39:22.118
of which I have plenty,
as you can well attest.

39:22.240 --> 39:24.549
Sometimes I think I need a vet.

39:24.680 --> 39:27.956
No, I find that, uh...

39:28.080 --> 39:29.513
I actually love you quite a bit.

39:32.360 --> 39:34.715
I love you too, Gary.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.711
But you're on
a mission from God.

39:38.840 --> 39:40.478
So where does that leave me?

39:40.600 --> 39:43.194
Well, you'll have to take that
up with him directly.

39:43.320 --> 39:44.878
I haven't even made it
to Pakistan yet,

39:45.000 --> 39:47.230
I got to get over there
as soon as I'm healed.

39:49.240 --> 39:51.356
I'm gonna go in. Do you want
a water or something?

39:51.480 --> 39:53.710
No, I'm all right.

39:53.840 --> 39:55.856
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
come on, hold-hold on a second,

39:55.880 --> 39:57.108
hold on a second.

39:58.600 --> 39:59.794
What if I didn't go?

40:01.080 --> 40:02.308
What if I just...

40:02.440 --> 40:04.112
stuck around here

40:04.240 --> 40:05.719
and helped out, you know?

40:05.880 --> 40:06.995
I'm a pretty good handyman.

40:07.120 --> 40:08.951
I could help out
around the house.

40:09.080 --> 40:10.911
Yeah.

40:12.720 --> 40:13.835
I'd love that,

40:13.960 --> 40:15.473
you know?

40:15.640 --> 40:18.996
But if you really feel
like you're on a mission,

40:19.120 --> 40:22.351
and I tell you to stay here,
you're gonna hate me.

40:22.520 --> 40:25.830
I... I couldn't handle that,
so...

40:27.080 --> 40:30.072
You think about it, and, um...

40:30.200 --> 40:32.555
and, uh, we'll talk later.

40:40.320 --> 40:42.834
I just want to enjoy
my life a little bit.

40:43.000 --> 40:47.676
I want to spend some time, a
domestic kind of, uh, lifestyle,

40:47.840 --> 40:49.353
with Marci and Lizzie, you know.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.038
- Good for you, Gary.
- Yeah.

40:51.160 --> 40:53.200
Yeah, that-that Pakistan shit,
the whole Osama thing

40:53.280 --> 40:54.599
is pretty crazy.

40:54.760 --> 40:57.479
Maybe so, but crazy is
my last name.

40:57.640 --> 41:00.598
- Isn't it crazy is my middle name?
- Yeah.

41:00.720 --> 41:02.517
My middle name is Brooks.

41:02.640 --> 41:03.800
It's that old Gary.

41:03.880 --> 41:06.110
- All right.
- Well, that's the truth.

41:06.240 --> 41:07.719
Okay, we got to jet,
we got a movie.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.736
- Yeah, you should come with us.
- Yeah, no, I'm gonna stay here

41:09.760 --> 41:12.194
and, uh, finish my beer,
and then, uh,

41:12.360 --> 41:14.396
maybe just go back
to Marci's house

41:14.520 --> 41:16.909
and enjoy my, uh, my humble
little domestic lifestyle.

41:17.040 --> 41:18.720
- All right.
- I'll take care of this guys.

41:18.760 --> 41:20.456
- Don't worry about that. Yeah.
- Really? -Really?

41:20.480 --> 41:22.016
- All right, see you later.
- All right, bye.

41:22.040 --> 41:23.473
All right, see you later.

41:23.600 --> 41:25.000
...in Afghaninstan

41:25.040 --> 41:26.360
- with his latest findings.
- Bye.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.072
Since the battle of Tora Bora

41:28.200 --> 41:29.872
in December of 2001,

41:30.000 --> 41:32.116
there has been
no actionable intelligence

41:32.240 --> 41:34.231
about where bin Laden is.

41:34.360 --> 41:36.078
There are informed hypotheses

41:36.200 --> 41:37.856
that he's in the northwest
frontier provinces

41:37.880 --> 41:39.871
- of Pakistan...
- I hate this show.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.911
...somewhere
in the tribal areas.

41:43.520 --> 41:46.239
W-Were you going to be doing
something for me?

41:46.360 --> 41:47.713
I was... I am.

41:49.520 --> 41:50.896
'Cause it looks to me
like you're quitting.

41:50.920 --> 41:52.239
I ain't no quitter.

41:52.400 --> 41:53.496
'Cause what would you think
would happen

41:53.520 --> 41:55.112
if I, God, just quit?

41:55.280 --> 41:56.952
- Chaos!
- Chaos.

41:57.080 --> 41:58.672
I mean, we've got chaos already,

41:58.800 --> 42:01.598
but we'd be talking about
a much worse form of chaos.

42:01.720 --> 42:02.789
Godless chaos.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.751
Who said anything
about quitting?

42:04.880 --> 42:07.599
What you don't seem
to appreciate Gary,

42:07.720 --> 42:11.076
is the notion of omniscience.

42:11.200 --> 42:12.679
That means I know everything,

42:12.840 --> 42:14.320
so I know you're thinking
about Marci.

42:14.440 --> 42:16.158
I know you're thinking
about domesticity

42:16.280 --> 42:18.000
and settling down
and how cute that will be.

42:18.080 --> 42:21.277
And it really bugs me
when men let woman-shit

42:21.400 --> 42:23.470
get in the way of man-business.

42:23.640 --> 42:27.155
There's two words
you need to consider:

42:27.280 --> 42:29.475
"God" and "America."

42:29.600 --> 42:30.749
That's what this is about.

42:30.880 --> 42:32.279
Okay?

42:32.440 --> 42:35.512
So what part of
"I am everything,"

42:35.640 --> 42:38.791
"I know everything,"
do you not understand?

42:38.920 --> 42:40.353
Uh, uh, if you know everything,

42:40.480 --> 42:42.755
then why don't you tell me
where to find Binny boy?

42:42.880 --> 42:44.871
I can tell you Pakistan,

42:45.040 --> 42:46.758
and you can't even get there.

42:46.880 --> 42:49.440
Now you're thinking
about quitting.

42:49.560 --> 42:51.357
You're a disappointment
to me, Gary.

42:51.480 --> 42:53.320
I've been waiting
for you to help me.

42:53.400 --> 42:56.870
Gary, shut the fuck up.
This is a holy quest.

42:57.000 --> 43:00.276
Holy quests are challenging.

43:00.400 --> 43:03.437
When I asked Abraham
to slaughter Isaac,

43:03.600 --> 43:05.272
that was challenging.

43:05.400 --> 43:06.976
He didn't just say, "Oh, he's
my son. What am I gonna do?

43:07.000 --> 43:08.797
I love him.
What am I gonna tell his mum?"

43:08.920 --> 43:11.434
When I said to David,
you've gotta kill Goliath,

43:11.560 --> 43:12.993
it was challenging.

43:13.120 --> 43:14.216
He didn't say,
"Look at the size of him.

43:14.240 --> 43:15.559
I can't do anything about it."

43:15.680 --> 43:17.636
It's a challenging situation
that you're in.

43:17.760 --> 43:20.672
I plucked you from obscurity.

43:20.800 --> 43:22.472
You're a lucky fuck.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.319
You should feel blessed,

43:25.440 --> 43:27.317
not burdened.

43:27.440 --> 43:28.919
So, Gary,

43:29.080 --> 43:31.719
I don't want to hear
any more talk about quitting

43:31.840 --> 43:33.592
or Marci, or TVs,

43:33.720 --> 43:37.076
or sitting and relaxing,
having a beer.

43:37.200 --> 43:38.349
Otherwise,

43:38.480 --> 43:40.311
I'm gonna smite you.

43:40.440 --> 43:41.998
I'm gonna smite you,

43:42.120 --> 43:44.475
and any memory
or remnant of you.

43:44.640 --> 43:46.756
Your dad, Gary Faulkner...
"l didn't have a son."

43:46.880 --> 43:50.395
Marci... "I don't remember
meeting some twinkle-eyed,

43:50.560 --> 43:51.788
goofy, cute guy."

43:51.920 --> 43:53.592
I will eliminate you

43:53.720 --> 43:55.438
from history, all traces of you.

43:55.560 --> 43:57.312
Okay?

43:57.440 --> 43:59.510
So have a little think
about that,

43:59.640 --> 44:00.993
and then make the decision

44:01.120 --> 44:03.076
that will make us both proud.

44:12.600 --> 44:13.999
Oh, great. You're drunk.

44:14.120 --> 44:15.997
I blew it.

44:16.120 --> 44:18.111
I was weak.

44:18.240 --> 44:20.993
I took my eyes off the prize,

44:21.120 --> 44:22.439
and he saw it.

44:22.560 --> 44:23.595
What prize?

44:23.760 --> 44:25.512
Who are you talking about?

44:25.680 --> 44:28.035
I gotta... I gotta...
get to Pakistan.

44:28.160 --> 44:29.832
Pakistan?

44:29.960 --> 44:32.235
What... what are you
talking about... Pakistan?

44:32.360 --> 44:34.476
I thought you were done
with all that nonsense.

44:34.600 --> 44:36.033
What about moving in here
with me?

44:36.160 --> 44:38.310
What about fixing the ramp?

44:38.440 --> 44:42.877
I have a more important job
to do.

44:43.000 --> 44:46.436
You know what? I need my
four hours of sleep tonight.

44:46.560 --> 44:48.949
I've got to work two
of my three jobs tomorrow,

44:49.120 --> 44:51.076
so I'm going to bed alone.

45:06.920 --> 45:08.831
What do you think?

45:10.360 --> 45:11.360
It's great.

45:11.440 --> 45:12.998
I told you I'd finish it.

45:13.120 --> 45:16.078
I'm sorry I slammed the door
in your face

45:16.200 --> 45:18.120
and yelled at you,
but, you know, you were really

45:18.160 --> 45:19.957
being crazy,
and I don't need that shit.

45:20.080 --> 45:22.150
Marci Mitchell,
don't you ever

45:22.320 --> 45:24.038
apologize to me for anything.

45:24.160 --> 45:25.388
You are perfect.

45:25.520 --> 45:26.520
You are

45:26.560 --> 45:28.232
an angel, and I'll see you

45:28.360 --> 45:29.998
when I get back from Pakistan.

45:32.440 --> 45:35.159
Sir, we have been through this.

45:35.280 --> 45:36.760
I do not care
about George Washington.

45:36.800 --> 45:37.800
You cannot

45:37.880 --> 45:38.710
go to Pakistan

45:38.880 --> 45:40.154
without an entry visa.

45:40.280 --> 45:41.896
This is bureaucratic morass
is what this is.

45:41.920 --> 45:42.920
Gary.

45:44.440 --> 45:46.510
Yes, my Lord.

45:53.680 --> 45:55.113
And God just...

45:55.240 --> 45:56.559
gave you a sign.

45:56.680 --> 45:58.079
That's right.

45:58.200 --> 45:59.599
And now you want to go

45:59.720 --> 46:00.720
to Pakistan...

46:02.080 --> 46:03.115
Why?

46:03.280 --> 46:05.157
To get bin Laden.

46:05.320 --> 46:06.639
Osama bin Laden.

46:06.760 --> 46:09.035
No, Harold bin Laden.

46:09.200 --> 46:10.872
Yes, Osama bin Laden.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.479
The terrorist.

46:12.600 --> 46:14.192
Is this some kind of joke?

46:14.320 --> 46:15.976
No, this couldn't be
any less of a joke, sir.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.355
This is as serious
as a thing can get.

46:18.480 --> 46:21.438
Okay, you give me one good
reason why I should stamp this

46:21.560 --> 46:24.552
and the United States of America
should let

46:24.680 --> 46:26.238
Gary Brooks Faulkner into

46:26.360 --> 46:29.352
one of the hairiest places
on Earth.

46:29.480 --> 46:31.118
Well, do you believe in God?

46:31.240 --> 46:32.240
And America?

46:32.360 --> 46:33.634
And justice?

46:33.760 --> 46:34.954
And freedom?!

46:35.080 --> 46:38.197
And just doing what's right?!

46:41.280 --> 46:42.280
Hmm.

46:44.600 --> 46:46.318
Thank you.

46:46.440 --> 46:47.919
Go get him.

46:53.200 --> 46:56.431
So, I'm going to Pakistan
to capture Osama bin Laden.

46:56.560 --> 46:57.993
Bring him to justice.

46:58.120 --> 46:59.553
God told me to do it.

46:59.680 --> 47:01.910
He didn't think I was being
urgent enough about it.

47:02.040 --> 47:04.156
Thought I was giving in
to temptation again,

47:04.280 --> 47:06.032
which has been
one of my problems.

47:06.160 --> 47:08.040
Kept me from achieving
certain things and stuff,

47:08.160 --> 47:09.479
but I'm gonna tell you what.

47:09.600 --> 47:11.875
God kicked the ever-loving
shit out of me.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.037
So, now here I am,
back on mission.

47:15.160 --> 47:17.958
I shouldn't be telling you this,
but I already got a lead.

47:18.080 --> 47:21.470
You see, it turns out over here,
people call Binny boy

47:21.600 --> 47:22.919
The Bearded One.

47:23.040 --> 47:25.634
So, there,
that could be helpful.

47:36.240 --> 47:39.038
Gary arrived
in Pakistan a stranger

47:39.160 --> 47:40.479
in a strange land.

47:42.320 --> 47:44.595
He was determined

47:44.720 --> 47:47.154
to observe the customs
of the local people

47:47.280 --> 47:48.599
and perhaps glean clues

47:48.760 --> 47:50.637
that would lead him
to bin Laden.

47:55.960 --> 47:57.791
Reason for visit?

47:59.840 --> 48:01.831
Taking care of business.

48:07.320 --> 48:08.833
Once through Customs,

48:08.960 --> 48:13.033
Gary saw a world both
familiar and foreign.

48:14.720 --> 48:16.199
In his personal diary,

48:16.320 --> 48:18.834
Gary wrote of his first day
in Pakistan...

48:20.480 --> 48:22.914
..."Got to Islamabad.

48:23.040 --> 48:25.315
"Interesting people.

48:25.440 --> 48:27.749
Hot as balls."

48:27.920 --> 48:30.388
So, anyways, so,
how do you like it here

48:30.520 --> 48:32.112
in Pakistan, my brother?

48:32.240 --> 48:33.878
Pakistan is very, very,
very beautiful.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.513
Pakistan is beautiful.

48:35.680 --> 48:37.056
Yeah, well, I figured
you'd say something like that

48:37.080 --> 48:38.638
on account of national pride.

48:38.760 --> 48:40.796
Well, I love America,
so we're even.

48:40.920 --> 48:42.478
I love America, too.

48:42.600 --> 48:44.033
Yeah? Well, America's very good.

48:44.160 --> 48:46.355
America's the best goddamn
country in the world.

48:46.480 --> 48:48.118
And I say that putting
my personal bias

48:48.240 --> 48:49.753
and national pride
aside because

48:49.880 --> 48:51.916
we don't have no Al-Qaeda
holing up in the States.

48:52.040 --> 48:54.349
Al-Qaeda here in Pakistan,
very bad.

48:54.480 --> 48:55.879
Yeah, very bad.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.416
- Well, see, I like you...
- Very bad.

48:57.440 --> 48:58.496
...because we got
a cultural connection.

48:58.520 --> 49:00.033
But what I need to do is I need

49:00.160 --> 49:01.256
to get to the Hotel AlBaraka.

49:01.280 --> 49:03.191
I'm on a very important mission.

49:03.320 --> 49:04.576
I'm looking for The Bearded One.

49:04.600 --> 49:06.033
Uh, do you know where

49:06.160 --> 49:07.336
- I can find The Bearded One?
- The Bearded One?

49:07.360 --> 49:08.475
The Bearded One.

49:08.600 --> 49:10.192
I am... I have got beard.

49:10.320 --> 49:11.958
Yeah, no,
I know you got a beard,

49:12.080 --> 49:14.016
but I'm talking about
The Bearded One.

49:14.040 --> 49:16.076
Do you have Denny's in Pakistan?

49:16.200 --> 49:18.156
Does The Bearded One
go to Denny's?

49:27.920 --> 49:30.115
Gary Faulkner, U.S.A.

49:30.240 --> 49:32.117
Gary Faulkner,
U.S.A.

49:32.280 --> 49:33.076
Fuckner?

49:33.240 --> 49:34.240
Fuckner?!

49:34.360 --> 49:35.554
No, not Fuckner, man.

49:35.680 --> 49:37.159
It's Faulkner, man. Faulkner.

49:37.280 --> 49:38.030
Fuck-ner.

49:38.200 --> 49:40.316
No, uh, it's Faulkner, man.

49:40.440 --> 49:41.668
Fuckner, that's what you said.

49:41.800 --> 49:42.816
Not Fuckner, Faulkner, man.

49:42.840 --> 49:44.558
Just call me The G.

49:44.680 --> 49:45.999
Uh, you got a bellhop

49:46.120 --> 49:47.519
that can help me with my bags?

49:47.640 --> 49:49.596
No, h-h-he's... he's dead.

49:49.720 --> 49:50.596
Dead?

49:50.720 --> 49:52.039
Did Al-Qaeda shoot the bellhop?

49:52.160 --> 49:52.990
No!

49:53.120 --> 49:54.120
Not at all, sir.

49:54.160 --> 49:55.354
Gangsters, sir.

49:55.480 --> 49:57.176
- He was killed for...
- Gangsters? Not Al-Qaeda?

49:57.200 --> 49:58.713
We have no Al-Qaeda here.

49:58.840 --> 50:00.273
I got an AK-47
shoved up my ass.

50:01.440 --> 50:02.919
He-he want... he want to s...

50:03.040 --> 50:04.393
to-to-to know about America.

50:04.560 --> 50:06.152
Man, America's good!

50:06.280 --> 50:08.111
- Hamburger.
- We got... we got hamburgers.

50:08.240 --> 50:09.514
We got Dairy Queen.

50:09.640 --> 50:11.320
We got the best chicken wings
in the world.

50:11.360 --> 50:13.476
- Woman, woman, woman.
- Fuck, man, but

50:13.600 --> 50:15.320
- we got the California girls, man.
- Woman.

50:16.720 --> 50:18.278
Fuckner good, Fuckner good.

50:19.880 --> 50:21.757
I told you, just call me The G.

50:21.880 --> 50:23.256
You are so funny.

50:23.280 --> 50:25.635
- I like it.
- Oh, yeah.

50:25.760 --> 50:27.656
All right, look, can somebody
show me where my room is?

50:27.680 --> 50:29.716
I got to get, uh, I have
a very important mission.

50:40.160 --> 50:43.869
Try it, motherfucker!

50:55.400 --> 50:57.868
Like all men on covert ops,

50:58.000 --> 51:00.912
Gary's first day was spent
doing reconnaissance.

51:03.720 --> 51:07.599
Scouring the streets,
looking for clues.

51:07.720 --> 51:11.156
A motivated Gary Faulkner
was a dangerous Gary Faulkner.

51:13.080 --> 51:16.277
Nothing could stop him
when he was on a mission.

51:16.400 --> 51:18.960
Nothing could make
him lose focus

51:19.080 --> 51:22.152
when he had a plan.

51:22.280 --> 51:25.272
These are all things
Gary Faulkner told me.

51:25.400 --> 51:28.597
You have many diverse
kind of sundry spices here.

51:28.720 --> 51:30.517
I think I can use
some of these spices

51:30.640 --> 51:32.198
in my chicken wing hot sauce,

51:32.320 --> 51:34.056
but I need molasses, too.

51:34.080 --> 51:36.071
Molasses. Do you have molasses?

51:37.880 --> 51:40.110
No, molasses, not jackasses.

51:40.280 --> 51:41.508
I didn't call you jackasses.

51:41.640 --> 51:43.551
I said molasses.

51:43.680 --> 51:45.400
Not calling you a jack...

51:45.440 --> 51:47.590
Here you go.

51:47.720 --> 51:50.154
Thank you.

52:02.880 --> 52:04.552
I'm looking
for something pretty

52:04.720 --> 52:06.119
for a young lady.

52:06.240 --> 52:07.520
- Yes, yes.
- She's not even ten.

52:07.600 --> 52:08.616
Okay? Something exotic,
something...

52:08.640 --> 52:09.789
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:09.920 --> 52:10.920
...something that has

52:10.960 --> 52:12.473
some flavor to it.

52:12.600 --> 52:13.919
Now, wait, this could work.

52:14.040 --> 52:15.189
- This is good.
- Yeah.

52:15.360 --> 52:16.190
This could work.

52:16.360 --> 52:17.475
Come on, here take this.

52:17.600 --> 52:18.600
I'm gonna take that.

52:26.520 --> 52:28.078
Good.

52:28.200 --> 52:29.997
Good, you got the...
you got the long knives.

52:30.120 --> 52:31.314
You got the short knives.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.715
You got the...
you got the Damascus.

52:33.840 --> 52:35.796
Check this out.

52:37.360 --> 52:38.952
Nothing?

52:39.080 --> 52:40.080
All right.

52:40.120 --> 52:42.111
Well, you have a blessed day.

52:47.680 --> 52:49.079
No, man.

52:49.200 --> 52:50.920
You're do... you're doing
it all wrong, man.

52:51.040 --> 52:52.393
You're not talking to the meat.

52:52.560 --> 52:54.120
That's how come
you've got no customers.

52:54.160 --> 52:56.469
You got to... you got to talk
to the meat.

52:59.440 --> 53:00.440
Goat meat, like all meat,

53:00.520 --> 53:01.748
has a vertical line

53:01.880 --> 53:04.599
and it has a horizontal line,

53:04.720 --> 53:07.598
and at the epicenter
of where those two lines cross

53:07.720 --> 53:08.856
is where the spirit
of the meat comes out.

53:08.880 --> 53:09.756
You say,

53:09.880 --> 53:11.313
"Thank you, baby goat."

53:11.440 --> 53:12.589
"Thank you, baby goat."

53:12.720 --> 53:14.176
"Thank you, baby goat."

53:14.200 --> 53:17.476
At the end of the first day,

53:17.600 --> 53:19.750
Gary realized this might be

53:19.920 --> 53:22.070
harder than he thought.

53:22.200 --> 53:24.760
If only God
could give him a sign.

53:39.600 --> 53:43.036
Looks like my brother Gary
cooked up a storm.

53:43.160 --> 53:44.639
I couldn't get the molasses,

53:44.760 --> 53:45.909
but if these aren't the best

53:46.040 --> 53:47.553
chicken wings
you've ever tasted,

53:47.680 --> 53:49.272
then I'm not the Donkey King.

53:49.400 --> 53:51.709
Thank you, sir, you are so kind.

53:51.840 --> 53:52.955
Oh.

53:53.120 --> 53:55.111
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.194
Don't worry, sir!

54:01.320 --> 54:02.799
I-I know a dentist.

54:02.920 --> 54:03.920
He's very good.

54:28.360 --> 54:29.554
Okay.

54:29.680 --> 54:31.511
Pass that around.

54:35.080 --> 54:37.389
That's nice.

54:57.320 --> 55:02.189
I fucking love Pakistan.

55:37.720 --> 55:39.392
Ride it, cowboy.

55:39.560 --> 55:40.436
Ride.

55:40.560 --> 55:41.788
Yeah.

55:46.040 --> 55:47.553
The G...

55:47.680 --> 55:50.797
...wants to get his pinball on.

55:50.920 --> 55:53.070
No worky?

55:59.360 --> 56:00.236
There you go.

56:00.360 --> 56:01.475
Come on, come on, yeah.

56:01.600 --> 56:03.989
Do you want to play some more?

56:04.120 --> 56:05.997
Ah, you fucking...!

56:11.440 --> 56:13.237
Thief!

56:13.360 --> 56:14.873
Hey! Hey!

56:15.000 --> 56:16.194
Stop! Hey!

56:16.320 --> 56:18.595
You stop it!

56:18.720 --> 56:20.756
Hey!

56:24.720 --> 56:26.711
You fucking fuck!

56:36.680 --> 56:37.908
Hey!

56:42.400 --> 56:44.960
Shit!

57:07.400 --> 57:08.469
Whoa!

57:09.840 --> 57:11.671
You know, I'm here
to capture The Bearded One,

57:11.800 --> 57:14.553
so if you have any info on him,
please let me know, but really?

57:14.680 --> 57:16.193
I don't see why you,

57:16.320 --> 57:18.754
sir, are messing
with this young lady.

57:23.040 --> 57:24.758
All right.

57:24.880 --> 57:26.393
So, we're gonna do this.

57:26.520 --> 57:29.671
Step aside, motherfuckers.

57:29.840 --> 57:33.355
100% pure
Japanese Damascus steel.

57:33.480 --> 57:34.520
Hey, hey, calm down, wait!

57:45.800 --> 57:48.678
Ah, smell that, sir?

57:49.840 --> 57:51.319
What's up?

57:51.440 --> 57:54.352
Smell of a people and a culture
clamoring for democracy.

57:57.680 --> 57:59.477
And aloo paratha.

58:00.800 --> 58:02.153
That the bread thing?

58:02.280 --> 58:04.111
- Yeah, with the potato inside.
- Yeah, yeah.

58:04.240 --> 58:05.856
- I like that, I like that.
- It's delicious.

58:05.880 --> 58:07.438
I mean, they make some
good stuff here.

58:07.560 --> 58:08.560
Bread was invented here

58:08.680 --> 58:09.556
in the lndus river valley.

58:09.680 --> 58:10.680
- Really?
- Yeah.

58:10.760 --> 58:12.034
That's great. Fascinating.

58:12.160 --> 58:13.036
What's this?

58:13.160 --> 58:14.160
This...

58:14.200 --> 58:16.350
regards an American samurai

58:16.480 --> 58:18.436
who is at loose
in the slums of lslamabad.

58:18.560 --> 58:19.976
- What does that mean?
- He appeared out of nowhere

58:20.000 --> 58:23.037
and he botched
an ongoing investigation.

58:42.400 --> 58:43.515
An American ninja.

58:43.640 --> 58:45.517
- Samurai.
- An American samurai.

58:45.640 --> 58:47.835
American Ninja was a movie,
1985, Michael Dudikoff.

58:58.080 --> 58:59.080
So, who is the guy?

58:59.160 --> 59:00.160
We have no idea.

59:00.200 --> 59:01.200
Well, let's find out.

59:01.280 --> 59:02.759
I will.

59:52.440 --> 59:53.555
- Gorgeous sunset.
- Oh!

59:53.680 --> 59:54.680
- Jesus.
- Sorry.

59:54.800 --> 59:56.028
Don't do that.

59:56.160 --> 59:57.752
- I wasn't trying to scare you.
- God.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.755
What do you think?

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.996
Why you have a thobe?

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.116
You still want to go undercover,
don't you?

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.117
Please?

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.673
Look, you're too tall.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.552
You're going to stick out
like a sore thumb.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.976
I'm not pretending
to be Pakistani.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.479
What are you going to be?

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.591
I'm going to be a, uh,
a national living abroad.

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.631
A South African, a Dutchman.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.677
A Norwegian, perhaps...
a farmer.

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.353
- W... you have this...
- A mercenary.

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.471
...bizarre fantasy that somehow

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.757
you're the Dutch James Bond
or something.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.279
I love James Bond.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.696
The Living Daylights
was on last night.

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.948
Timothy Dalton...

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.911
- greatest Bond of all time.
- No.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.234
- No?
- No, no, no.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.576
Who do you like...
oh, Sean Connery?

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.715
No.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.717
- Roger Moore?
- No.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.512
The-the new guy with the...

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.676
- The m... the Russian thug? No.
- ...muscles?

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.630
What's happening
with our American samurai?

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.753
American samurai,
actual name, Gary Faulkner.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.836
He's been indicted
several times,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.592
minor, uh, misdemeanors.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.554
Works as a handyman.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.591
He's searching
for Osama bin Laden.

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.776
What do you mean, "he's
searching for Osama bin Laden?"

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:03.800
He's obsessed.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:04.949
If this fucking lunatic's

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.195
anywhere near him,

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.514
I'm truly fucked.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.936
- Do you understand me?
- That's true.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:10.136
So this cannot happen,
all right?

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.416
- This is worse...
- This is on you.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.998
This is worse
than the $5 million.

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.838
It's wo... it's worse
than the $5 million,

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.030
so you know what?
Do your job.

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.037
Find this guy.
Bring him in.

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.355
And we're going
to neutralize him.

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:29.430
Welcome Al-Qaeda crips
to my cave.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.840
My name is OBL, Osama bin Laden.

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.712
But this is my homies
on the left here.

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.656
This guy here, he make them
white boys tremble,

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.136
so we just call him Milkshake,
you know.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.878
We got one DVD box set,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.149
Seinfeld, man.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.656
D-don't know...
Jews are funny, man.

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.136
- Like Kramer.
- Jerry!

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.754
Osama, Osama Jr., Osama III,

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:46.640
'cause Osama Junior Junior
Junior was stupid.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.520
Yo, Muhammad, third
from the right, who's she?

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.709
My main man, ldi Amin.

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:51.056
Pulled some tight shit
in Uganda.

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.080
You know what I'm saying?

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.349
Ayatollah Khomeini.

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.078
This guy got
mad beard skills, man.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.838
Got the baddest
motherfucker alive,

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.029
George W. Bush.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.754
Oh, God!

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:37.680
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.472
Oh, my God!

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.512
- Get in the truck, Gary.
- Yes, my...

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:51.154
I'm sorry.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.238
Where are you going, Gary?

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.793
I don't know.

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:58.911
You don't even know
where you're going, do you?

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.076
You're just wandering around
aimlessly.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.918
No particular direction.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.190
No better than a paramecium.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.196
A what?

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.197
A paramecium, Gary.

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:09.594
It's a single cellular
life form

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:10.988
I created some time ago.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.678
I was pretty proud of it
back then.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.320
Still around to this day,
because Noah,

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.376
in his infinite wisdom,
chose to put it on the Ark,

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.720
along with syphilis
and gonorrhea.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:20.559
Y-you're all-knowing, right?

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:21.976
Yeah, yeah, I am,
all-knowing. Yeah.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.256
Well, then,
why don't you help me?

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.296
I mean, just like a-a drop.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.150
Helping hint.

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.594
There's no hints, Gary.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.109
This is not a treasure hunt,
or a quiz show.

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.998
You got freedom of choice.

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.513
Freedom of thought.

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.216
Do you know how beautiful
that is? I mean,

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.656
I know every thought
before you think it,

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.856
and let me tell you,
a lot of the thoughts

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.108
you got coming up

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.753
are pretty fucking stupid.
I am God.

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:41.757
I am the question
and the answer.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:43.990
- Yes, my Lord!
- What's this now?

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.176
What's this?
It's not Aladdin.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.428
I'm not a genie.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.073
You are genuflecting
too aggressively.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.713
You're gonna set off
the airbag.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.536
Well, uh, of course,
I could be wrong, my Lord.

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.437
My Sweet Lord,
but I-I think this model

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.993
doesn't come with airbags.

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:56.553
Shut up, Gary!

01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:57.715
Shut up!

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.193
Sorry. Lord, I'm sorry.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.197
I'm just... I'm just lost.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:04.118
You got any idea how many times
I hear that every day?

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.593
"I'm lost, then I was found.

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.039
I'm blind, now I can see."

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.976
I'm tired of that lost shepherd,
lost sheep shit.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.353
Yes, Lord.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.357
- Don't fucking "Yes, Lord" me.
- Yes, Lord.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.856
- I said don't say that.
- Yes, Lord.

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.677
- Gary! -Yes, Lord.
- What? -No, Lord.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:18.633
- Are you saying no to me, Gary?
- No!

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:21.115
I'm doing too much shit
to worry about this.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.629
I've got 14 trillion
things to deal with right now.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.638
I'm doing a million things
in this moment.

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.910
I'm dealing
with Hezbollah, Ebola,

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.758
some guy called Obama,
Coca-Cola.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.199
I got a lot of shit
to deal with.

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.320
Do you understand me?

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.919
But I just want you to be happy.

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.429
Well, then, Gary, try this.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.275
I help those
that help themselves.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.951
Gary began to battle episodes

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:52.117
of paranoid hallucinations.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:55.670
Maybe it was because he had
gone weeks without dialysis.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:59.156
Maybe it was because
he had smoked, in his words,

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:02.636
"A shit-ton of hash."

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:21.793
He sensed eyes on him,

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:25.310
and saw danger in every corner.

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:28.959
Hey!

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:31.109
Give me that moped.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.429
Give me that thing.

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.357
Give it up.

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.598
Get out of my way!

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:00.920
You're letting him get away.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:02.109
My handle was bad.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.356
You're letting him get away!

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.957
Technically, a yacht is, uh,

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.308
anything over 30 feet.

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.736
This was just below,
it was about 26,

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.976
so I wouldn't say it
was a yacht.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.096
What was the yacht for?

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:16.599
Uh, sailing in San Diego.

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.312
- Business?
- Uh, yeah. Sure, business.

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.176
Wh... no. I was trying
to get Osama bin Laden.

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.936
That's what I'm here for.
We've already been over this.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.616
Uh-huh. And-and so what were
you doing in the yacht?

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:25.480
- Were you smuggling?
- No, I wasn't smuggling.

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.709
I was trying to get here.

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:29.593
- Who are you working with?
- Uh...

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.336
I'd tell you,
but you wouldn't believe me.

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.793
- MI-5.
- No.

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.035
- SAVAC?
- No.

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.513
- Mossad.
- No.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:36.390
- It was...
- No, no.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.748
I'm a lone wolf.

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.711
- Is that your handler?
- My handler?

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.400
- I don't have a handler.
- You and who?

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:43.038
- No, it's just me. You know,
- And?

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.296
I-I don't expect
someone like you

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.640
- would understand that.
- Try me.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.876
- Just give me a name.
Any name. Any contact.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.072
All right, well, we can talk
about that one right now.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.758
I-I... it's just me and God.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.074
Is-is he your handler, God?

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.553
You don't know who God is?

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.672
- He's God!
- Where is he currently?

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:00.199
- Can we talk to him?
- God?

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.080
- Yeah, can I talk to him?
- He's everywhere.

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.376
- Do you have an email address?
- He's everywhere.

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:04.600
Just one place.
Name one place.

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:05.880
Uh, he's right here,
right now.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.956
- You know what I'm going to do?
- What?

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.376
I'm going to make your life
a living hell.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.496
'Cause I can do that.

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:11.600
- 'Cause I have power.
- Oh!

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.756
- Is that a threat?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.433
All right, this is it.

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:16.879
You know what?

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.736
You'll never even travel again.
You're grounded.

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:21.718
I am going to send you
out of here right now

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:23.796
to pack up your shit,
and we're going to

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.376
- put you on a plane,
- Deporting you.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.096
- And send you back to America.
- I love this.

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:28.480
- Thank you.
- Where you will stay.

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:29.840
- Okay.
- You will never come back

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.108
- to Pakistan again.
- Okay.

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.559
- Buh-bye.
- All right. Bye-bye.

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:33.795
Bye-bye.

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:36.912
Maybe we should turn him.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.393
Make him one of ours.

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:41.239
He's got the goods.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.237
I just want to say thank you.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.193
It was good and it was cheap,

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.320
and-and you're my friend,

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.736
- and I love you.
- Thank you, sir.

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.113
You're so kind.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.468
You'll be always welcome.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.989
Thank you, sir.

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:55.314
Shareef Hahsid,

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:56.953
thank you for keeping me safe.

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:02.433
Thank you.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:03.560
- Bye, sir.
- Bye.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.908
Have a nice trip.

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.640
- We will miss you.
- I'll miss you, too.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:09.598
- Maybe I like to visit America one time.
- Oh, man.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:12.996
- You gotta come with me to America, dude.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:14.792
- If you come back another time,
- Abso...

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:16.656
- I want to visit your mother place.
- Absolutely, Shareef.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.895
- Yeah, take care.
- Absolutely.

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:19.478
Get down!

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:23.834
It was later learned
that the shots fired

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:26.554
from the rooftop were not
from an Al-Qaeda sniper,

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.238
but the result of a dispute

01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:30.669
between the shooter

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.995
and the hotel's
security guard,

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:36.157
concerning one of the man 's
two wives and a goat.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:37.633
Sorry.

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.118
Sorry, sorry, comi ng through.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.240
Sorry, coming through.

01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:00.630
Goddamn it!
Fucking scaffolding?!

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:04.479
Next time use a backup line.

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:24.716
Taxi! Taxi!

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:26.558
My friend! My friend!

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:29.154
- Taxi!
- I will give you a ride. Come.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.917
Do you see that motorcycle?

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.189
- Follow him.
- Like movie.

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:34.992
Yeah. Like movie,

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.120
although real.

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.111
Go, Havidee, go!

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.993
Ah! Fuck!

01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:48.310
We have been driving
for two hours.

01:09:48.439 --> 01:09:50.590
I'm running out of gas.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.234
That son-of-a-bitch
is Al-Qaeda.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.032
That is his name, Al-Qaeda?

01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:57.960
- No, he's in Al-Qaeda.
- He is?

01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:59.598
That's right.
And he's going to lead us

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.312
- to Osama bin Laden.
- Us?

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:03.510
- Are you serious?
- I'm damn serious.

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.153
There he is.
He's going up the hill.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.508
Follow him.

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.016
I'm telling you,
we're gonna lose this guy.

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.109
I cannot, my friend.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.549
This old thing will not make it
up the road.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:13.272
All right. Look, I understand.

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.630
Are you sure
you won't come back with me?

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.955
We could have tea and talk
about football and women.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.071
Maybe some day, my friend.
Maybe some day,

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:23.158
but right now,
I've got a job to do.

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:36.110
After all the hardships,

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.593
the struggles,

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:39.119
the wrong turns,

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:41.754
Gary had caught the scent
of his quarry.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:46.914
Osama bin Laden was just
over this hill.

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.152
Hello.

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:52.236
Shit.

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:59.756
♪ Everybody really wants
to know ♪

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:04.078
♪ How it is
that I love you so. ♪

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.193
Hi, God.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.231
Hey, Gary.

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:12.237
Here you are,

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.430
closer to him

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:15.675
than ever.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:17.711
And he's out here, isn't he?

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.796
You feel him, Gary.

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.996
He's out here.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:34.791
I was irresponsible
in making your species.

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.673
Cursing you with consciousness.

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.556
Gary.

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.830
I'm just like you.

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:50.111
A handyman trying to fix up
a cosmic shack

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:53.670
with a nail here
and a lick of paint there.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:58.191
Knowing that the building
really needs to be condemned.

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.108
People say that I made you
in my image,

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:05.277
but the truth is,

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:07.152
you made me in yours.

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.390
That's why we're in trouble.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:27.915
The G is in the air.

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.396
King Donkey's in the sky.

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:34.389
Hey, there.

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:35.669
It's me.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:36.869
It's the G.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.355
What the hell?

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.835
Oh, shit.

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:47.234
I see you, Binny boy.

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.873
The time has come.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.797
The G has arrived.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.718
Yeah, yeah, y-y-yeah.

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:16.593
Y-y-yeah, y-y-y-yeah!

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:19.075
Bin salam alaikum
Binny boy.

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.430
Alaikum salaam, Gary Fuckner.

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.198
This is where you live?

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:24.799
This shit hole?

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:27.269
What happened to the place
I saw on TV?

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.628
W-What place was that, Gary?

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:29.988
Your crib, man.

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:31.519
Don't you watch TV?

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.756
You had all those photos
with the terrorists.

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.598
Your own customized
pinball machine.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:38.877
- Pin... what is pinball?
- Don't fuck with me.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.736
Gary, I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.113
You know it's really
very simple.

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:43.656
Let me see if I can explain
it to you

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:47.434
in words you might be able
to understand.

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:48.936
America's the greatest country
on Earth.

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:50.296
I'm not talking
about the government.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.416
I might even agree
with you there,

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:52.634
a bunch of crooks and liars.

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.637
I'm talking
about the people, Osama.

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:55.760
They're good people.

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.233
Gary, stop it. Stop talking.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.759
- Uh, oh.
- Shut up.

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:00.711
- Shut up, is that what you're saying?
- Yes.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:02.558
I don't really know
how you got in here,

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:04.432
or what you're even doing here,

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.152
but I'm going to give you
one chance

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.759
to turn around and leave.

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:09.056
Oh, you're going
to give me a chance.

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.080
Yes.

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:11.912
See, I'm Osama bin Lad...

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.376
Don't laugh. I'm Osa...

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:14.753
Hey.

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.677
- No, I'm Osama bin Laden.
- Okay.

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.096
Yeah, and I'm the head of the Al-Qaeda.

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.429
And I will not rest
until my mission

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:22.955
is accomplished, or at least
until I die a glorious

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.752
fiery death trying.
Stop laughing.

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:27.713
I had a feeling you were going
to say something like that.

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.592
In that case...

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:32.075
looks like I've got a job to do.

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.200
Un-fucking-believable.

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:39.715

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:09.032
My fingers are tingling!

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.040
It's not my fucking fault.
I didn't expect that.

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:29.833

I won! I won!

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:53.517
Mr. Faulkner.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:56.629
- Good morning.
- Hi.

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.034
How are you feeling?

01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.736
- Can I get you anything? A Pepsi?
- Stop, stop it.

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.056
He's a diabetic;
don't give him a Pepsi.

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:02.336
You're gonna throw
him into shock.

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:03.952
- Where am I? Where am I?
- Diet Pepsi?

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:05.376
- You are in a hospital
- A U.S. hospital.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.536
- In Islamabad.
- You were found

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.152
in a field unconscious.

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:09.349
Where's Osama?

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:11.515
Osama?!

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:14.233
Gosh, he's not here.

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:16.456
- What about the cave?
- Mr. Faulkner, there are millions

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.629
of caves in Pakistan.

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:19.080
I don't think
you were in a cave.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.633
Even if you were in a cave,

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:22.336
we wouldn't be able to identify
which cave you were in.

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:24.715
- You let him go!
- You know what, you're frustrated.

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.296
- Calm down, your heart.
- We're all frustrated,

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.435
Mr. Faulkner.

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.480
- I had Osama bin Laden!
- You did not have him!

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.240
- And you let him go!
- You never had him!

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:32.076
- Don't you bother me.
- You never had...

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.280
You let Osama bin Laden go.

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:34.913
- Stay, please.
- You never had

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.234
- OBL!
- I had him!

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.072
You let him go!

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:04.560
- Hey.
- Oh, oh!

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:07.616
- I'm back.
- Oh, my God, get in here.

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:09.312
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:10.953
Lizzie!

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:12.080
Guess who it is?

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.434
There she is!

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:14.675
Oh, I've got surprises.

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:16.472
I've got goodies.

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:18.238
Oh, look at this.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.799
You know what this is?

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.069
Look.

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.760
This is an exotic dress
from Pakistan.

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:25.949
Isn't that nice?

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.798
- That is gorgeous.
- Yeah, well,

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.360
they were very nice there.
They were.

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:30.799
They were very welcoming,

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:32.216
and one day I'd like
to take both of you there.

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.116
It'd be an adventure.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.240
We'd love to go.

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:35.236
- Yeah.
- Right?

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.360
Yeah.

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.549
I hope you don't mind.

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:39.238
I called a radio station,

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:40.760
and-and I told them
all about you...

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:41.896
- Radio station?
- ...and I think they want

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.069
- to interview you...
- Oh.

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.336
...later on this week,
if that's okay.

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.236
An interview?

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.918
Well, I'd have
to check my schedule.

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.268
You know, I have a lot to do.

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.595
I'm-I'm planning
and training and...

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.631
but, uh, well,
we'll see, we'll see.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:54.079
- Yeah.
- Oh.

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:55.536
- I'm glad you're home.
- I'm glad to be back.

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:56.816
- I am.
- I'm so glad you're home.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:57.936
- I'm so glad I'm home.
- Thank you.

01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:59.109
I'm so glad I'm home.

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.576
- Okay, you want to try this on?
- Yeah.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.592
Duh-duh-duh-duh!

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:04.596
- Huh?
- Oh!

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:05.789
Yeah!

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:06.920
You look great.

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.633
I'll get it!

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.192
- Gary! Gary! Gary!
- The fuck!

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:17.436
Oh, shit!

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.118
Oh, my God.

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:20.536
Tell us about your experiences.

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.232
Yeah, yeah, with bin Laden,
yeah.

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.856
Dr. Ross, it's-it's Gary.

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.552
He's on the radio.

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:27.536
Uh, tell us, Gary,
how did you finance the trip?

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.516
Yeah, I lied
to my kidney doctor.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:31.272
I told him I bought
an engagement ring,

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:34.278
but really I bought a boat
and sailed to Pakistan.

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.096
Most people thought I was crazy,

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.720
but I guess to my friends,
I seem normal.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.114
Yeah.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:42.496
You know, I really could not

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:43.776
have done anything
without Marci,

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:44.880
and you know what they say.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.592
It's easier to beg
for forgiveness

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:48.597
than to ask for permission.

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:52.474
Hollywood called, and they want
to make a movie about The G,

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.397
and they said,
"Who do you want to play you?

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.636
Clint Eastwood or Dan Aykroyd?"

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:57.988
I thought,
"I don't know."

01:18:58.120 --> 01:18:59.599
And then they
brought up Nic Cage.

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:01.597
I said,
"Nic Cage did Con Air."

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:04.757
Don't you think I look a little
like Nic Cage in Con Air?

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:10.472
Let me help you
with the groceries.

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:12.198
- I can get that.
- Thanks.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.675
Yeah.

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.589
Lettuce.

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:18.720
Oh, thanks.

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:19.989
Oh, wow.

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.758
Roasted marshmallows
are the best.

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.029
These are the best.

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:28.276
Um... you know, I was going
to make veggie lasagna tonight.

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:30.391
I'd love to but...

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:31.800
I-I-I got to be straight
with you

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.558
because I know it's important,
you know.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:36.353
I-I'm going back to Pakistan.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:41.633
You're going back to Pakistan.

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.637
Well, yeah, I got
to get the job done.

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.193
Are you afraid of anything?

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:46.389
Does anything scare you?

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.238
Islands.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.634
Islands? What do you mean?

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.336
- Like... island-islands?
- Yeah... yeah.

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:52.679
Like Hawaii?

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:54.136
Yeah, most people
are afraid of islands.

01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.800
They just don't know it,
but it's natural.

01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:57.856
It's natural to fear them
because when you're on an island

01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:59.313
you're surrounded and stuff,

01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:00.536
and, anyway, I'm more inclined

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.760
'cause I'm a Leo, and lions...

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:03.056
they just have no place
on an island.

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.080
I mean, that's a fact.

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.120
That's a fact.

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:11.110
Do you want to know
what I'm afraid of?

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:12.395
Bats.

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:13.669
No.

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:16.557
That's all I got.

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:19.353
It's a long list.

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:21.391
Well, hey, listen...

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:23.317
as long as I'm around,

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:26.591
if you need any help
slaying any demons,

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.199
I'm your man.

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:30.470
And what about
when you're not here?

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.273
- Come on.
- Where's Lizzie?

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:42.913
School.

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:50.837
Come on.

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:02.433
Tonight, I can report
to the American people

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:05.313
that the United States has
conducted an operation

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:07.908
that killed Osama bin Laden,

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.155
the leader of Al-Qaeda.

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.510
The images of 9/11 are seared

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:12.959
into our national memory.

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.308
And a terrorist

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.396
responsible for the murder
of thousands

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:18.033
of innocent men,

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:19.275
women, and children.

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:21.356
Jet planes... cutting through...

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:23.511
a cloudless September sky.

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:26.552
The Twin Towers collapsing to the ground.

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.216
I determined
that we had enough...

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:30.435
Oh, my God, this is a big day
for America, okay.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:32.118
Those guys are heroes.

01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:34.635
...to get Osama bin Laden

01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:36.273
and bring him to justice.

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:38.630
The United States launched
a targeted operation

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.512
against that compound...

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:41.914
Gary, are you okay?

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:44.036
Oh, yeah.

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.678
That crazy God of mine.

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:49.837
He sure works
in mysterious ways.

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:52.235
It's a sign.

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:54.920
I'd be foolish not to heed it.

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:58.715
You know, that last construction
company offered me a job.

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.277
Maybe it's time we take this
to the next level.

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:04.656
There's no doubt that
Al-Qaeda will continue

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:06.272
to persue attacks against us.

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:07.896
Traditional procedures

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:09.751
for lslamic burial
were followed.

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:13.111
The deceased's body was washed,
then placed in a white sheet.

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:16.477
After, the body was placed
on a prepared flat board,

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:18.875
tipped up, whereupon
the deceased's body

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.831
slipped into the sea.

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.394
Well...

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.556
what do you think?

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:27.671
They buried him at sea.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:31.713
Really?

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.791
No pictures yet released,

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:35.638
but there's still
a lot more information...

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:41.599
The U.S. government
is embarrassed,

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:45.110
because they have not caught him
yet, so they want to make us

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:47.151
believe that he's dead.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:50.397
Otherwise,
why not show us his face?

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:51.839
Show us his body.

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.632
Why-why the burial at sea?

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:57.639
He's alive and I'm the only one

01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.637
who can capture him.

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:01.955
I am Gary Faulkner.

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:04.395
I'm the Donkey King.

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:07.796
It's a lie!

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.359
I'm going back!

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:10.913
That's right, Lizzie.

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.840
When you find your purpose,
you have to do it.

01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:14.911
You have to do it,
no matter what.

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.076
Lizzie! Lizzie!

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.872
This is my sword.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Well, it was my sword.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:21.120
Now it's your sword.

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:23.231
Wait a minute.

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:24.634
You don't need a sword.

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:26.830
This is just a stick
to hold a balloon.

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:29.274
Just a handle for joy

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:31.271
as far as I'm concerned.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.396
So, you hold on tight,
sweetheart,

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:35.431
because joy comes forever.

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:38.757
Joy comes forever.

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:42.509
Aw, I love you, too, sweetheart.

01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:45.438
Don't wait up, babe.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:52.991
Gary!

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:55.509
Come back.

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.713
Don't worry, I will.

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.192
So, why don't you use
your free will

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.952
and freedom of choice,

01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:59.310
and then make the decision

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:02.716
that'll make us both proud.

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.474
What?

01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:19.710
What if I just gave up?

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:22.189
You, me, and...

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:26.552
Lizzie, we could just
spend some time together.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:34.873
I love you, Marci Mitchell.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.592
I don't know.

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:42.836
Come on.

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:53.636
Gary.

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:56.636
Gary!

01:25:57.880 --> 01:25:58.949
Gary!

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.156
All's I want to go do
is take a nap

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:05.555
for about two days.

01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:15.792
Gary Faulkner
from Greeley, Colorado,

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:18.878
was found alone in a forest
in northern Pakistan.

01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:25.296
Well, I was thinking that
someone's got to get him.

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:26.435
Why not me?

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.616
And joining us now exclusively

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:40.676
this morning is Gary Faulkner.

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.432
- Good morning.
- Well, good morning.

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:43.959
Did you find out where he was?

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.040
Yeah, he's waiting in a cave
for me to go get him.

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:06.096
But because
he had broken no laws,

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:08.475
Pakistan didn't charge
him with any crime.

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:11.433
All of this right here,
I didn't even want any of it.

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:22.872
You were in Pakistan
for ten days.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.797
You were captured
by the Pakistani officials.

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:31.096
His trips cost a lot of money,

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.678
but they were not about him.

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.520
He said they were
about the American people.

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:43.598
I have never met more humble
and open people than that.

01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:53.416
Well, how do you go about
trying to find Osama bin Laden?

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:54.634
You don't.

01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.830
You let the spirit guide you.
