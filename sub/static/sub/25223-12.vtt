Hello, I'm Dara O Briain,

00:36.060 --> 00:39.010
and "w-helcome" to the phlegm
that I just dislodged...

00:39.010 --> 00:40.060
LAUGHTER

00:43.060 --> 00:46.000
HE CLEARS THROAT

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Hello, I'm Dara O Briain and welcome
to the last in the current

00:49.000 --> 00:50.010
run of Mock The Week.

00:50.010 --> 00:52.090
Series 17 has seen us covering
the usual array of momentous

00:52.090 --> 00:54.000
world events -

00:54.000 --> 00:57.090
Brexit, nuclear summits, Cold War
espionage, World Cup semifinal

00:57.090 --> 01:00.080
heartache, and Donald Trump having a
mushroom-shaped penis.

01:00.080 --> 01:03.060
It's been truly unforgettable.
Anyway...

01:03.060 --> 01:05.000
LAUGHTER

01:05.000 --> 01:07.030
As ever, please enjoy the following
selection of best bits,

01:07.030 --> 01:08.060
unseen material and outtakes.

01:08.060 --> 01:10.040
I'll see you in December for a
Christmas special.

01:10.040 --> 01:12.000
Hope you enjoy it.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.020
Moving on...

01:14.020 --> 01:18.080
What are becoming less popular with
children? Is it paedos?

01:18.080 --> 01:20.020
LAUGHTER

01:20.020 --> 01:22.010
APPLAUSE

01:25.030 --> 01:27.060
In the '70s they were
very popular, to be fair.

01:27.060 --> 01:29.070
LAUGHTER

01:29.070 --> 01:34.090
It's clowns, but I would say they've
never been popular with children.

01:34.090 --> 01:37.010
Who likes clowns?
Do you like clowns?

01:37.010 --> 01:40.090
Depends what sweet they've got.
Oh, sorry, clowns, not paedophiles.

01:43.040 --> 01:46.060
It's the make-up. What are you
hiding? Write a joke, you prick.

01:48.050 --> 01:51.070
That's very harsh, cos I'll have
you know that is Dara.
LAUGHTER

01:53.000 --> 01:56.040
There was a time where this crew
involved doing your... Making your
bones, you know,

01:56.040 --> 01:59.020
after you... working the circuit,
doing the Butlins thing, you know?

01:59.020 --> 02:01.000
You all just breezed in
with your Edinburghs.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.020
Some of us had to daub on the paint
and go out there and do eight

02:04.020 --> 02:06.000
shows a week, honey!

02:07.050 --> 02:10.030
And Chuckles here is proud of
that time he did.

02:10.030 --> 02:13.090
It was an academy for some of us, so
put on the damn nose and shut up.

02:13.090 --> 02:16.020
HE SINGS THE MUSICAL NOSE TUNE

02:16.020 --> 02:18.080
And then I'd turn on my giant
shoes...

02:18.080 --> 02:20.000
APPLAUSE

02:23.040 --> 02:26.030
I'm going to do a spin on my giant
shoes and twack, twack away.

02:27.060 --> 02:31.040
I always wondered why your car was
so small. Now it makes complete
sense.

02:31.040 --> 02:34.070
There are less than 100 clowns now
in Britain apparently.

02:34.070 --> 02:38.070
Yeah, less than 100 registered
clowns. Yes.

02:38.070 --> 02:42.020
Which brings up a whole horrible
scenario of unregistered clowns.

02:43.090 --> 02:46.020
Clowns that have somehow
been struck off.

02:47.040 --> 02:50.000
Presumably their car stayed
together and they weren't

02:50.000 --> 02:53.050
welcome any more. "I hear you can do
some unregistered clowning for you.

02:53.050 --> 02:54.080
"Yeah, I can do..."

02:54.080 --> 02:57.000
LAUGHTER

02:57.000 --> 03:00.040
"What do you want, with the full
face and the hair and everything?

03:00.040 --> 03:01.090
"I've only got one shoe, though."

03:01.090 --> 03:03.070
Twacky, twacky...

03:03.070 --> 03:05.030
"I've got to tell you,
I'm a bit of a maverick.

03:05.030 --> 03:07.020
"Sometimes the bucket
won't have confetti.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.080
"It'll just have boiling water."

03:10.080 --> 03:14.040
I feel sorry for the new head
of clown recruitment.
Big shoes to fill.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.080
LAUGHTER AND GROANING

03:15.080 --> 03:19.030
Yeah, that's right, yeah, that's
right, I went for one of them.

03:19.030 --> 03:20.040
I've got range.

03:21.080 --> 03:24.000
Don't you worry.
You're a very funny boy.

03:25.050 --> 03:29.080
I see you as my son on this team
today. I'm flanked by my sons.

03:29.080 --> 03:32.040
That's why I've worn basically a
nursery pattern on my...

03:32.040 --> 03:34.070
Just in case you get a bit
nappy later on.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.080
Me and Rhys do look like we could be
brothers, don't we?

03:37.080 --> 03:38.090
Oh, don't do this, mate.

03:38.090 --> 03:40.010
LAUGHTER

03:41.040 --> 03:44.000
I know where this is going, mate.
I know I look like an ill you.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.040
LAUGHTER

03:46.090 --> 03:48.000
APPLAUSE

03:52.060 --> 03:54.030
That is very harsh on yourself.

03:54.030 --> 03:56.080
You look like me if I died in a
coal mine when I was 12.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.000
LAUGHTER

03:59.020 --> 04:01.030
Whatever, Ed, mate. "Oh, I used
to be fat, now I'm thin."

04:01.030 --> 04:03.000
I've been thin forever, shut up.

04:04.080 --> 04:07.050
Yeah, but yours is clearly for
medical... Whatever!

04:09.020 --> 04:12.010
I think you look a bit like
Russian-doll you.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.080
I've never been inside Ed.

04:17.010 --> 04:19.010
Not ruling it out.

04:21.019 --> 04:23.010
And thunderclap,
they did thunderclap?

04:23.010 --> 04:24.090
Yeah, actually,
we call it the Viking clap.

04:24.090 --> 04:27.000
I don't know why people call it
the thunderclap here.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.080
That just sounds like some terrible
disease, like on...

04:31.010 --> 04:32.080
What is it, though, what is it?
Do the thing.

04:32.080 --> 04:35.010
Do the thing we brought
you here to do.

04:35.010 --> 04:37.000
Just do the thing
and let's go see it.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.010
HE SIGHS

04:38.010 --> 04:40.040
HE STAMPS TWICE AND CLAPS Hoo!

04:40.040 --> 04:42.020
AUDIENCE TRY TO JOIN IN

04:43.040 --> 04:45.000
Whoa, stop, stop, stop.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.030
You are just dreadful at this.

04:49.070 --> 04:53.000
Stop following his feet. The pause
is long and it gets narrower.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.070
Here's a clue. His hands, when his
hands move... Maybe there, right?

04:58.070 --> 05:00.080
Rather than any time
the mood struck you.

05:02.030 --> 05:06.000
I think we should film this and just
put the word Brexit in front of it.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.060
LAUGHTER

05:07.060 --> 05:08.080
APPLAUSE

05:11.050 --> 05:13.040
OK, let's try that again, shall we?

05:15.000 --> 05:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here

05:23.010 --> 05:25.090
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

05:27.020 --> 05:30.050
All clapping themselves, like you
got that right the first time.

05:30.050 --> 05:33.040
That's how happy you were with
yourselves there.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.080
And there were still two people
who got that wrong.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.060
This is so impressive, cos you
guys are so synchronised.

05:39.060 --> 05:42.030
The most synchronised thing that
English fans can do is dance

05:42.030 --> 05:43.080
to Come On Eileen at a wedding.

05:45.030 --> 05:46.050
Or like, say...

05:46.050 --> 05:49.000
# You're just a shit
shop in London... #

05:49.000 --> 05:52.050
..which they said before the
Iceland match, and then they lost.

05:53.090 --> 05:55.090
LAUGHTER

05:55.090 --> 05:57.020
APPLAUSE

05:59.010 --> 06:01.030
What's the thing you shout, by
the way, during the thunderclap?

06:01.030 --> 06:02.060
It's "hoo!"

06:02.060 --> 06:05.040
OK. I know the noise it is,
but does it mean something?

06:05.040 --> 06:07.090
It literally means nothing.
It just means, like... Hoo!

06:07.090 --> 06:09.060
Yeah. Sounds like a goddamn owl.

06:10.080 --> 06:14.010
Yeah, but it's...
Like when the French...

06:14.010 --> 06:16.070
HUGH MIMICS OWL
When the French adopted it...

06:16.070 --> 06:18.050
Ho-o-o-o!

06:20.060 --> 06:23.000
Ho-o-o-o!

06:23.000 --> 06:24.030
Twit-twa-Hugh.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.040
APPLAUSE

06:30.060 --> 06:33.080
She looks like she's from a
Quentin Blake drawing. Oh, stop it!

06:33.080 --> 06:36.020
LAUGHTER

06:36.020 --> 06:38.000
She actually does and it's so bad!

06:39.050 --> 06:41.080
One of those lesser-known
Roald Dahl...

06:41.080 --> 06:46.080
Can we go back to that picture of
Justin Trudeau? Cos he's really hot.

06:46.080 --> 06:49.040
I've got the hots for him.
OK, there is Justin Trudeau.

06:49.040 --> 06:52.030
He's like the sort of Michael Buble
of politics, isn't he?

06:52.030 --> 06:55.050
In that you and your mum both
definitely would.

06:55.050 --> 06:56.070
LAUGHTER

06:57.080 --> 06:58.090
Presumably, Debbie,

06:58.090 --> 07:02.030
you'd want some gap or some kind
of... Not at the same time, Dara.

07:02.030 --> 07:04.020
What's wrong with you?

07:04.020 --> 07:07.080
"Mu-u-um! "It's my turn!"
"I'M doing Justin Trudeau now!"

07:09.030 --> 07:11.030
"You ruin everything!"

07:11.030 --> 07:13.040
Stop being rude-eau with Trudeau!

07:13.040 --> 07:15.030
Thing is, though,
I kind of only like Trudeau

07:15.030 --> 07:18.010
cos his name sounds like
when someone from Croydon

07:18.010 --> 07:20.050
is trying to convince you
that they're not lying.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.060
True, dough, innit?

07:23.060 --> 07:25.030
APPLAUSE

07:25.030 --> 07:27.090
I could not deliver that joke.
I could not...

07:27.090 --> 07:29.060
..could not land that joke.

07:29.060 --> 07:31.040
You... No, you just change it
to Ireland.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.040
Oh, yeah.
IRISH ACCENT: "It's true, dough!"

07:33.040 --> 07:35.060
LAUGHTER

07:37.030 --> 07:39.080
That would be true enough,
dough, no, yeah.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.000
APPLAUSE

07:42.040 --> 07:44.000
Our next round is called Newsreel.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.060
We play a recent piece of footage
featuring people in the news,

07:46.060 --> 07:49.000
and ask Hugh to suggest
what might be being said.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.020
This week's clip features
the Prince of Wales.

07:52.020 --> 07:54.020
HUGH: "Your Royal Highness,
I'm Piers Morgan."

07:54.020 --> 07:55.070
POSH ACCENT: "Oh, yes, I know you.

07:55.070 --> 07:58.040
"You're the fat one from
Britain's Got Talent."

07:58.040 --> 08:00.060
"My father is a very big fan
of Stavros Flatley.

08:00.060 --> 08:02.080
"What are you... What are you
doing at the moment?"

08:02.080 --> 08:05.060
"I'm the world's greatest
television interviewer."

08:05.060 --> 08:08.000
"Oh, God, how tedious!

08:09.030 --> 08:11.060
"Don't laugh at me, Morgan,
I could have you killed.

08:13.020 --> 08:15.080
"Oh, I recognise you, don't I?
You're, um..."

08:15.080 --> 08:19.010
SCOTTISH ACCENT: I am Lorraine,
your Royal Highness."

08:19.010 --> 08:22.040
"Of course, yes, Lorraine,
my... My favourite quiche."

08:24.080 --> 08:27.060
DEEP, RASPING VOICE: "Yes,
Lorraine, we love your programme."

08:27.060 --> 08:29.020
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

08:29.020 --> 08:32.080
"I wake up every morning with
a packet of Lambert & Butler

08:32.080 --> 08:35.000
"and a copy of the Racing Post."

08:36.039 --> 08:40.030
"Do you have any food?
I'm absolutely starving."

08:41.030 --> 08:42.090
ITALIAN ACCENT: "What do you fancy?"

08:42.090 --> 08:44.030
"Oh, something meaty and spicy."

08:44.030 --> 08:46.030
"Oh, really? Meaty and spicy
are my middle name!

08:46.030 --> 08:48.030
"Actually, not true,
my name is actually Steve,

08:48.030 --> 08:50.040
"I come from Croydon,
but this Italian thing is..."

08:50.040 --> 08:51.080
LAUGHTER

08:51.080 --> 08:54.050
"Phillip, Phillip...
Please, they're coming, please...

08:54.050 --> 08:56.060
"What are you doing down there?"

08:56.060 --> 08:59.030
"I was... I was just
stroking the cat from that advert.

08:59.030 --> 09:00.080
"It just won't leave me alone."

09:02.000 --> 09:04.070
POSH ACCENT: "Oh, here's Richard
and Judy, lovely to meet you.

09:04.070 --> 09:08.000
"Lovely to see you, Judy,
and you, Richard.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.070
"Yes, the... The trouble and strife
will be along in a moment,

09:10.070 --> 09:13.030
"she loves your programme.
She loves you, she loves, er...

09:13.030 --> 09:15.020
"Jeremy Kyle."
DEEP VOICE: "Hello."

09:16.050 --> 09:18.040
POSH ACCENT: "She also loves
that programme,

09:18.040 --> 09:20.030
"what's the programme
you love on Channel 5?

09:20.030 --> 09:22.000
"The one about the...
About the vets?"

09:22.000 --> 09:23.020
DEEP VOICE: "Oh, yes.

09:23.020 --> 09:26.070
"That's called
Psycho Pussies: When Cats Attack.

09:26.070 --> 09:29.060
"Oh... Oh, this...
Oh, that's bouncy.

09:31.020 --> 09:33.010
"You love a bit of bouncy,
don't you?

09:33.010 --> 09:34.090
"You love bouncy, don't you, love?"

09:34.090 --> 09:36.080
POSH ACCENT: "Oh, yes,
I love bouncy. I...

09:36.080 --> 09:39.060
"I would live in a bouncy castle
if I could."

09:40.060 --> 09:43.090
NORTHERN IRISH ACCENT: "Come to
Eamonn, Camilla, come to Eamonn.

09:43.090 --> 09:46.010
"I love you. I love your coat.

09:46.010 --> 09:48.080
"I love your wife. I love you.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.080
"Any chance of a knighthood?"

09:51.090 --> 09:53.050
"I... I feel a little bit sick."

09:54.090 --> 09:57.060
POSH ACCENT: "So, just... Oh, I've
got a bit of an itch on my nose.

09:57.060 --> 09:59.000
"I'll just wipe that...

09:59.000 --> 10:01.030
"So what's this? Is this
made of ground-up peasant?"

10:02.040 --> 10:05.000
"Laugh at my joke, laugh at my joke.
I'm the Prince of Wales,

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
"that's right,
laugh at my joke. Yes."

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
DEEP VOICE: "I'm just going
to try some of it.

10:11.050 --> 10:14.000
"I suspect... Oh, that's lovely.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.020
"That really does have a bit of
an afterburn. My God.

10:17.020 --> 10:18.070
"Oh, that's hot, Phillip."

10:18.070 --> 10:21.070
POSH ACCENT: "I tell you what, just
keep your eye on Schofield. He...

10:21.070 --> 10:23.080
"He thinks that's cheese."

10:23.080 --> 10:26.090
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

10:26.090 --> 10:28.030
Well done, Hugh!

10:28.030 --> 10:29.080
Thank you.

10:32.090 --> 10:34.090
In other news,
who might you spot

10:34.090 --> 10:37.050
at a West Bromwich Albion
game this season?

10:37.050 --> 10:39.010
Some great footy players.

10:39.010 --> 10:40.080
LAUGHTER

10:40.080 --> 10:42.070
Sorry!

10:45.080 --> 10:48.080
Sorry, I laughed the microphone off!

10:50.090 --> 10:53.010
In other news, who might
you sp... Oh, fuck that.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.060
Dara, can you please
be professional, mate?

10:57.060 --> 10:59.090
In other news, who might you spot

10:59.090 --> 11:02.030
at West Bromwich Albion f... ootball
games this season?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.070
What? There was actually
nothing wrong with that!

11:06.070 --> 11:09.060
You put about five Fs on football!

11:09.060 --> 11:12.040
What? Fffootball! Football!

11:12.040 --> 11:15.050
Yeah...

11:18.020 --> 11:20.010
I like watching the f-f-f-football!

11:22.000 --> 11:24.010
In other ne-e-ews...

11:25.040 --> 11:26.080
What's going on?!

11:26.080 --> 11:29.090
Who might you be... spotting...
at West Bromwich Albion...?

11:31.040 --> 11:33.020
Which character am I even doing?

11:33.020 --> 11:36.030
Anyone else worried they'll
be never turned on again?

11:37.050 --> 11:40.010
Why, has that ruined
some sexual fantasy?

11:41.050 --> 11:43.050
Oh... Stevens, ah...

11:43.050 --> 11:45.020
Oh, Ms Stevens, ah...

11:46.050 --> 11:49.000
You know, now that your two
boys are out of the room...

11:49.000 --> 11:51.010
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

11:53.090 --> 11:55.040
In other news,

11:55.040 --> 11:58.040
who might you spot at West Bromwich
Albion games this season?

11:58.040 --> 12:00.000
Some great footy players! Yes!

12:01.080 --> 12:04.040
You mean... f-f-f-football players?

12:06.050 --> 12:08.080
Is it West Brom's new mascot?

12:08.080 --> 12:10.030
It is West Brom's new mascot,

12:10.030 --> 12:13.040
who is one of the most
endearing and delightful...

12:13.040 --> 12:16.040
..heart-warming mascots we've seen.
Do you know who it is?

12:16.040 --> 12:19.080
Is it a boiler, by any chance?
It is a boiler!

12:24.080 --> 12:26.080
Who wouldn't be cheered up by that?

12:26.080 --> 12:29.040
Please show some respect.
It is a combi boiler.

12:30.090 --> 12:33.010
What I love is there's
literally no effort made

12:33.010 --> 12:35.010
to anthropomorphise the boiler.

12:35.010 --> 12:37.040
There's no face! Surely...

12:37.040 --> 12:39.060
It's one thing cutting
armholes and legholes -

12:39.060 --> 12:43.090
that's surely useful - but a face
is surely the basic minimum.

12:43.090 --> 12:46.000
I presume... How does he see
where he's going?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.020
It would be behind the...
I think there is a...

12:48.020 --> 12:51.060
They haven't just put him into a
metal boiler and pushed him loose,

12:51.060 --> 12:55.000
to wander through the pitch,
just this metal thing with just

12:55.000 --> 12:58.020
arms and... Like some
sort of weird punishment.

12:58.020 --> 13:00.070
But this is going
to be a problem for...

13:00.070 --> 13:03.040
Look, one of the great things
that the internet has thrown up -

13:03.040 --> 13:06.010
and there's not many - but one of
the great things it's thrown up

13:06.010 --> 13:10.000
is the fact that on Remembrance Day
or at football games that happen

13:10.000 --> 13:12.020
at moments of any kind of
national significance,

13:12.020 --> 13:14.090
the players have to stand
for a minute's silence,

13:14.090 --> 13:17.040
and the mascots have to stand
next to them.

13:17.040 --> 13:20.020
And that means there's going to be,
this year at Remembrance Day,

13:20.020 --> 13:22.030
there's going to be a
bunch of people

13:22.030 --> 13:24.080
remembering the two world wars
and a fucking boiler!

13:26.010 --> 13:28.080
What if he bends down
and the door just...

13:30.000 --> 13:31.070
APPLAUSE

13:34.000 --> 13:36.010
Anyway, the Labour Party.
The Labour Party, yes.

13:36.010 --> 13:38.040
Cos they will be watching.
You're watching, aren't you?

13:38.040 --> 13:40.030
You're watching and you're going
to tweet us

13:40.030 --> 13:42.040
if we say anything
mean about the Labour Party.

13:42.040 --> 13:45.000
Cos we said, "You'll tweet us,"
last week, and you tweeted us.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.070
Oh, there was fantastic ones.
I had a number of people who said,

13:47.070 --> 13:50.020
"Actually, Dara, I'm very...
I'm just very disappointed."

13:50.020 --> 13:53.040
And I'm going, "You're not my mum!"

13:53.040 --> 13:54.090
Somebody tweeted, just going,

13:54.090 --> 13:57.090
"That's this Corbyn supporter never
watching that programme again.

13:57.090 --> 13:59.090
"I do not enjoy being mocked!"

13:59.090 --> 14:01.080
Er...

14:01.080 --> 14:03.040
UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER

14:03.040 --> 14:05.040
APPLAUSE

14:07.030 --> 14:10.040
In other news, how did Japan's space
agency make history this week?

14:10.040 --> 14:13.020
Oh, it landed on an asteroid.
They have landed on an asteroid.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.020
I don't know how far it is from...
Where is it?

14:15.020 --> 14:17.010
It's in space. Yeah.

14:18.020 --> 14:20.050
Thank you, Dara, the scientist!

14:20.050 --> 14:21.060
The good news is that

14:21.060 --> 14:24.080
Theresa May is confident we can
do a trade agreement with it.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.090
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

14:30.070 --> 14:33.060
The photographs are incredible.
Have you seen them? I have, yes.

14:33.060 --> 14:34.090
It's very barren,

14:34.090 --> 14:36.090
but there is already a
branch of Costa.

14:38.030 --> 14:39.070
The photos aren't incredible.

14:39.070 --> 14:41.060
They're not incredible.
The photos are chaos.

14:41.060 --> 14:44.040
They're like the ones people take
when they're pissed at a wedding

14:44.040 --> 14:46.000
with those disposable cameras.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.020
It's like the... It's like
the asteroid got nervous

14:48.020 --> 14:50.020
cos it was having
a selfie with space.

14:51.030 --> 14:53.010
Oh, got my thumb over the lens!

14:53.010 --> 14:55.020
They came back with a sticker
on them saying,

14:55.020 --> 14:57.060
"Perhaps you were moving too
fast when you took those!"

14:57.060 --> 14:59.070
What... Ed...

14:59.070 --> 15:02.060
Ed, was that the joke
about developing photos?!

15:04.020 --> 15:05.080
Sorry, everyone, just...

15:05.080 --> 15:08.050
By the way, you are watching a
new episode of Mock The Week!

15:10.040 --> 15:12.020
This is not a repeat on Dave!

15:13.020 --> 15:15.080
Just made a photo-developing joke!

15:15.080 --> 15:18.030
Do remember when you
had to put the big...

15:18.030 --> 15:21.020
You had to put the thing over your
head and you had to look down and...

15:21.020 --> 15:23.010
And people would put...

15:23.010 --> 15:25.050
They'd get their top has just right
and then you would go...

15:27.000 --> 15:28.090
The best thing about it is
they're going to go

15:28.090 --> 15:31.020
and they're going to get samples
and then they're going to

15:31.020 --> 15:34.010
bring them back...
LOUD SNORING

15:35.040 --> 15:39.070
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

15:39.070 --> 15:41.020
You want me to...

15:41.020 --> 15:43.070
..in a Manchester accent,
I'll do it in Manchester...

15:43.070 --> 15:45.040
MANCHESTER ACCENT: Brilliant!

15:46.080 --> 15:48.080
It's not...
You know it's not just his accent.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.020
He is an actual scientist!

15:51.070 --> 15:54.050
But they want to bring it back,
which means it'll land roughly...

15:54.050 --> 15:55.080
The asteroid? No, a section...

15:55.080 --> 15:57.080
It means we get to do this
story again! Brilliant!

15:57.080 --> 16:00.000
We will do it again
and you will learn!

16:00.000 --> 16:02.040
But it'll be right during
the Olympic opening ceremony.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.030
Could you imagine how great
that would be, like,

16:04.030 --> 16:06.030
during the Olympic
opening... it comes back down

16:06.030 --> 16:08.030
in the middle of the opening
ceremony, it comes back down?

16:08.030 --> 16:10.040
Look how excited you are!
It's not what they're planning...

16:10.040 --> 16:13.000
They're not going to do that,
obviously, sorry. You genuinely
thought...

16:13.000 --> 16:14.080
Yeah, right, middle of the...
So excited!

16:14.080 --> 16:16.020
They light the flame, instead...

16:18.030 --> 16:21.010
It'll be like when you stole
the moon in Despicable Me!

16:21.010 --> 16:22.050
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

16:26.090 --> 16:29.040
What has the US suddenly found
itself with a massive surplus of?

16:29.040 --> 16:30.080
Racists. Yes...

16:30.080 --> 16:32.050
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

16:36.080 --> 16:38.050
Also... Yes? Cheese. Yes.

16:38.050 --> 16:41.070
I mean, it's one way to
make America grate again.

16:41.070 --> 16:43.090
LAUGHTER AND GROANS

16:43.090 --> 16:46.020
APPLAUSE

16:48.000 --> 16:49.060
It is. It is, yes.

16:49.060 --> 16:52.050
The US has amassed 630 million
kilograms of cheese -

16:52.050 --> 16:55.000
the largest stockpile
since records began.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.080
Who's keeping a record of that?

16:56.080 --> 16:59.020
The cheese people are
keeping records!

17:01.000 --> 17:03.010
This is a question -
if they've got so much cheese,

17:03.010 --> 17:05.000
why don't they build
a wall out of it?

17:06.030 --> 17:09.020
Spike a few nachos,
stick them on the top, problem over!

17:09.020 --> 17:12.010
If anything, you're slightly
making the border more appealing.

17:12.010 --> 17:15.020
People are going to go,
"We have built a wall...

17:15.020 --> 17:19.010
"An edible wall.
Don't come near our edible wall!"

17:19.010 --> 17:21.069
You'd keep out lactose intolerant.

17:21.069 --> 17:25.050
OK, grand... It'll keep out
the lactose intolerant!

17:25.050 --> 17:27.089
You would have to hope it was
cheese without holes in it,

17:27.089 --> 17:29.060
as well, wouldn't you?

17:29.060 --> 17:31.060
You think they might
slide through them...?

17:31.060 --> 17:33.090
If it was like, you know,
an Emmental or something,

17:33.090 --> 17:34.090
they might just slip...

17:34.090 --> 17:37.010
I suppose the Americans don't
have much Emmental,

17:37.010 --> 17:38.040
thinking about it. Mm.

17:39.070 --> 17:42.000
They really missed a trick
by not keeping all the cheese

17:42.000 --> 17:43.040
in Philadelphia.

17:43.040 --> 17:45.000
LAUGHTER AND GROANS

17:45.000 --> 17:46.030
How many more have you got?

17:46.030 --> 17:48.030
You're on a bit of a roll
here, aren't you?

17:48.030 --> 17:50.080
It's such short bits
that make the edit, I find.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.040
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

17:54.060 --> 17:58.030
At the time of recording, we don't
know the result of England's
semifinal match against Croatia,

17:58.030 --> 18:01.050
but whatever happens, this was
still the country's best
performance at a World Cup...

18:01.050 --> 18:03.070
You really want me to do this in
a really flat, you know,

18:03.070 --> 18:05.040
so you have it. Yeah.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.080
So you don't want me in any way
to put anything interesting

18:07.080 --> 18:09.090
rather than just read the words.

18:09.090 --> 18:12.040
Perhaps, I think, if
you could put some positive...

18:12.040 --> 18:15.080
OK, at the time of recording,
we don't know the result...

18:17.030 --> 18:19.020
..of England's semifinal
match against...

18:19.020 --> 18:21.000
AS RICHARD BURTON:
No-one could have believed!

18:22.060 --> 18:26.070
Across the universe, they gaze
upon us with envious eyes!

18:28.060 --> 18:30.050
She looked on unexpect...

18:30.050 --> 18:36.070
Sorry, but it, uh, took ages to get
to the mic and then I messed it up.

18:36.070 --> 18:39.000
Step back... Step back...

18:39.000 --> 18:41.020
Step back and walk back in again,
if you want.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.000
I'll do whatever the hell I want!

18:43.000 --> 18:45.040
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

18:47.070 --> 18:49.040
BUZZER

18:51.050 --> 18:54.050
If you... If you want anarchy,
you'll get anarchy!

18:55.080 --> 18:59.040
At the time of recording, we
don't know the result of England's

18:59.040 --> 19:01.030
semifinal match against Cro-at-ia,
but...

19:04.030 --> 19:07.060
But whatever happened, oh, those
brave boys have still delivered

19:07.060 --> 19:09.060
the country's best performance
at a World Cup

19:09.060 --> 19:11.030
since nineteen hundred and ninety.

19:14.050 --> 19:16.040
We... We...

19:16.040 --> 19:18.010
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

19:20.000 --> 19:21.050
No, no...

19:21.050 --> 19:23.020
No, no... No...

19:23.020 --> 19:24.090
I... Rachel...

19:24.090 --> 19:25.090
No, no... Please...

19:27.060 --> 19:28.090
What a great guy I am!

19:30.090 --> 19:33.060
Does anyone want to know an
exciting thing that just happened?

19:33.060 --> 19:35.060
Yes. Have England scored?
England scored?

19:35.060 --> 19:36.090
Dara's got a boner.

19:36.090 --> 19:39.070
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

19:41.090 --> 19:43.080
How many more ways can I do this?

19:43.080 --> 19:46.020
OK, I shall do it this way!

19:46.020 --> 19:47.080
GASPS

19:49.050 --> 19:53.030
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

19:53.030 --> 19:54.070
At the time of recording,

19:54.070 --> 19:57.080
we do not know the result of
England's game against Croatia.

19:57.080 --> 19:59.020
But whatever happened,

19:59.020 --> 20:02.060
this was still the country's best
performance at a World Cup

20:02.060 --> 20:04.060
since 1990!

20:04.060 --> 20:06.040
End scene!

20:06.040 --> 20:08.010
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

20:10.000 --> 20:11.090
OK, here we go. The first subject...

20:11.090 --> 20:14.030
LAUGHTER

20:14.030 --> 20:17.040
You're such a dick.
You are such a dick.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.030
I'll tell you what,

20:20.030 --> 20:23.020
I've always wanted to be on
the episode where you lose it.

20:23.020 --> 20:25.020
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

20:27.010 --> 20:29.090
What has the Archbishop
urged church leaders to do?

20:29.090 --> 20:31.020
Have a big wank.

20:38.050 --> 20:42.010
Ladies and gentlemen, Britain's
foremost satirist, Nish Kumar!

20:42.010 --> 20:44.050
Hence the phrase,
bashing the Bishop.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.040
In other news,

20:51.040 --> 20:53.090
what has a Devon primary
school banned this week?

20:53.090 --> 20:55.020
Inbreeding.

20:58.060 --> 21:01.010
They've banned the dance,
haven't they? They've banned...

21:01.010 --> 21:04.040
The flossing dance.
Flossing, they've banned, yes.
Which is from Fortnite, isn't?

21:04.040 --> 21:06.070
It's not from Fortnite.
I don't know anything about...

21:06.070 --> 21:09.020
Sorry, I got very angry about that,
didn't I? I really got...

21:09.020 --> 21:10.050
It's not from Fortnite!

21:10.050 --> 21:13.030
Yeah, Grandad!
Get with the programme! Jesus!

21:13.030 --> 21:16.040
It's just a dance that we kids do...
Dara, can you floss?

21:16.040 --> 21:19.010
I can floss, but I'm not going to do
the flossing... Of course you are!

21:19.010 --> 21:20.020
Go on!

21:20.020 --> 21:22.010
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

21:22.010 --> 21:24.020
CHANTING: Dara, Dara, Dara!

21:24.020 --> 21:27.040
Floss, floss, floss, floss, floss!

21:37.010 --> 21:39.020
You can do that as long as you want.

21:40.040 --> 21:44.080
Really has no power over me,
I don't... I don't have to floss.

21:44.080 --> 21:47.060
You're approaching this...
You're approaching this all wrong.

21:47.060 --> 21:50.020
The way to do it is very... I know
this man, it's as simple as this.

21:50.020 --> 21:52.020
I don't believe you can!

21:52.020 --> 21:54.000
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

21:57.060 --> 22:00.030
That's very clever, but now
you've told me your method.

22:00.030 --> 22:02.060
My arse am I going to floss
on national television!

22:02.060 --> 22:04.040
Dara, Suzi and I will
do it with you.

22:04.040 --> 22:05.090
Don't get me involved in this, mate!

22:05.090 --> 22:07.020
LAUGHTER

22:07.020 --> 22:09.000
Hey, hey, why did I get passed...?

22:09.000 --> 22:10.080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

22:13.050 --> 22:15.020
Hang on, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You start...

22:15.020 --> 22:16.090
Start by going that way first,
that way first.

22:16.090 --> 22:19.040
And then across over. We are likely
to make this very, very bad.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.020
Right, this was banned in schools...

22:21.020 --> 22:23.020
If you're watching in Devon,
turn it off now.

22:24.020 --> 22:27.000
It's grand, I've just won my game
of Fortnite, and then...

22:27.000 --> 22:28.060
Oh!

22:28.060 --> 22:30.030
Too much space.

22:30.030 --> 22:32.000
No, it's... Dara, that's not it.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
That's... That... That...
No, no, no...

22:35.000 --> 22:36.050
That...

22:36.050 --> 22:39.050
That... That... That...

22:39.050 --> 22:41.020
No...

22:43.030 --> 22:45.040
I feel like it's... There we go,
I've got it.

22:45.040 --> 22:47.000
I was literally doing that!

22:47.000 --> 22:49.070
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

22:52.020 --> 22:54.060
I think the worst thing about
this is that this clip will

22:54.060 --> 22:56.080
feature on the internet
with "it's coming home".

22:56.080 --> 22:58.040
LAUGHTER AND CHEERING

23:03.070 --> 23:07.040
Watching that is the youngest
I've ever felt in my life.

23:07.040 --> 23:10.020
Just to say, if anyone thinks
that had no satirical value,

23:10.020 --> 23:12.060
right, on a topical show,
let me just say this.

23:12.060 --> 23:15.080
What happened there was the will
of the people was respected,

23:15.080 --> 23:17.040
no matter how stupid the idea.

23:17.040 --> 23:19.090
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

23:23.000 --> 23:24.050
Next topic is...

23:27.000 --> 23:29.020
And it was when the apple
fell on his head

23:29.020 --> 23:31.050
that Newton made
his greatest discovery -

23:31.050 --> 23:32.090
apple helmet.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.090
And now to demonstrate
chaos theory,

23:39.090 --> 23:42.040
we have Theresa May
explaining Brexit.

23:47.060 --> 23:50.030
Saturn, with its dozens of moons,

23:50.030 --> 23:52.060
its majestic rings of ice...

23:52.060 --> 23:55.060
..thinks it's S-O-O-O-O-O great!

23:59.020 --> 24:02.060
And what we can conclude
from that experiment

24:02.060 --> 24:04.020
is cows don't bounce.

24:08.050 --> 24:11.050
God made that. God made that.
God made that.

24:11.050 --> 24:14.010
No questions, thank you. Goodnight!

24:18.080 --> 24:21.000
First there was the Big Bang.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.060
And, then, seconds later,

24:22.060 --> 24:25.070
I was exchanging my insurance
details with the other driver.

24:29.020 --> 24:33.090
In 1997, I did a fart so bad my dad
called a plumber because he thought

24:33.090 --> 24:37.020
there'd been a sewage leak but it
was actually the fart that I'd done.

24:37.020 --> 24:39.090
Nish Kumar's An Inconvenient Truth.

24:43.060 --> 24:46.000
Hi, I'm Brian Cox and,
finally, they've let me do

24:46.000 --> 24:49.040
a science programme without
that Irish guy in it.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.020
Hi. I'm Professor Brian Cox,
and this is Dara O Briain.

24:59.020 --> 25:02.070
And, tonight, we're finally going to
find out what happens...

25:02.070 --> 25:04.040
..when we kiss.

25:10.080 --> 25:12.060
And, today, we'll follow the sperm

25:12.060 --> 25:15.030
on its journey towards its
beautiful conclusion -

25:15.030 --> 25:17.030
the bedsheets of this Travelodge.

25:21.030 --> 25:24.010
And it was then that Einstein
rocked the world of physics

25:24.010 --> 25:25.050
with his famous equation -

25:25.050 --> 25:27.070
E = "McTwo."

25:34.090 --> 25:39.060
So, genetically, blue-eyed parents
can only have blue-eyed children.

25:39.060 --> 25:42.090
I have blue eyes, my wife has blue
eyes, therefore my daughter has...

25:42.090 --> 25:44.060
Hang on a minute.

25:47.050 --> 25:50.050
And because we found
this slither of thigh bone

25:50.050 --> 25:52.030
and gentle shards of skull,

25:52.030 --> 25:56.000
I think we can say that this is
the worst hotel breakfast in the UK.

26:01.010 --> 26:04.050
Scientists believe that elephants
first evolved the trunk

26:04.050 --> 26:07.050
as a sort fertile,
auxiliary reproductive organ.

26:07.050 --> 26:09.050
Or face dick.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.070
And, now, here's the periodic table.

26:16.070 --> 26:18.020
Sorry - Loose Women.

26:24.010 --> 26:25.090
Next topic is...

26:28.090 --> 26:32.030
You can, of course, make your own
pasta if you've got too much time

26:32.030 --> 26:34.040
on your hands,
you pretentious prick!

26:36.070 --> 26:39.000
Well, while we're waiting
for the rice to cook -

26:39.000 --> 26:41.010
that'll take another
five or six minutes -

26:41.010 --> 26:42.060
I'm going for a poo.

26:50.080 --> 26:53.060
SCOTTISH ACCENT: So, I used
to be one of those chefs

26:53.060 --> 26:55.030
that shouts and swears a lot

26:55.030 --> 26:57.040
but then I discovered oven gloves.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.030
Today, I'm using a Smeg fridge
which is just like a normal fridge

27:07.030 --> 27:09.020
that I don't clean regularly enough.

27:14.020 --> 27:17.020
If you're having trouble whipping
them up into stiff peaks,

27:17.020 --> 27:19.060
have you tried
gently cupping their balls?

27:23.030 --> 27:27.070
Hello! And welcome to Cooking
After You've Come Home Pissed!

27:29.050 --> 27:32.050
Tonight, we're doing a Cup-a-Soup
that's slightly gone past

27:32.050 --> 27:34.040
its best-before date!

27:34.040 --> 27:37.040
It'll taste better if you put
some HP sauce in it!

27:42.070 --> 27:45.000
Now, try not to drizzle
too much oil on the lamb

27:45.000 --> 27:46.090
or it will wriggle free and escape.

27:49.090 --> 27:53.060
I don't know about you but I really
love upside-down pineapple cake.

27:53.060 --> 27:56.030
Or, as Australians call it,
pineapple cake.

27:56.030 --> 28:00.060
Or, as Australian pineapples
call it, the cake of death!

28:05.040 --> 28:09.020
Well, I enjoyed this meal so much
when I had it in a Parisian

28:09.020 --> 28:11.080
restaurant that I asked
the chef what it was called.

28:11.080 --> 28:13.080
So this is my own version of...

28:13.080 --> 28:15.060
..Fuck Off, English!

28:20.050 --> 28:24.020
Mary Berry is quite critical of
the soggy bottom but, to be fair,

28:24.020 --> 28:26.080
in this kind of heat,
it's kind of unavoidable.

28:29.010 --> 28:32.020
Welcome to another edition
of Cooking When Pissed!

28:33.030 --> 28:37.030
This week, you just stick it in
the oven and turn it up to 190.

28:37.030 --> 28:40.090
Have a nap. When the smoke alarm
goes off, it's done!

28:46.040 --> 28:49.070
Well, you may be wondering, what is
the perfect accompaniment to

28:49.070 --> 28:51.020
a Scotch egg?

28:51.020 --> 28:53.040
Simple. Scotch sperm.

28:58.080 --> 29:02.030
Now, my wife absolutely loves
street food but that's probably

29:02.030 --> 29:04.030
because I married a pigeon.

29:07.040 --> 29:09.020
Now, normally for this recipe,

29:09.020 --> 29:12.090
I like to use pork lardons but my
producer doesn't listen,

29:12.090 --> 29:16.060
so I spent the entire morning
making some pigs very happy.

29:20.030 --> 29:23.050
So, today, I'm going to be
making banana wine.

29:23.050 --> 29:26.010
And I'm going to be pressing
the skins with my bare feet.

29:26.010 --> 29:27.010
Wah!

29:33.060 --> 29:36.010
This week...!

29:36.010 --> 29:39.020
This week we're going to be tackling
that very difficult dish,

29:39.020 --> 29:43.020
which is the potato waffle that
fell out of the packet months ago

29:43.020 --> 29:45.020
and has been stuck in the ice...

29:47.060 --> 29:49.070
All we need is a very sharp knife.

29:55.020 --> 29:59.010
Hello, I'm Nigella Lawson, and
welcome to the non-innuendo cookery

29:59.010 --> 30:02.030
hour where we'll be teaching you how
to cock... dick... wank... willy...

30:07.010 --> 30:10.010
Weirdly, 13 years ago,
you didn't know about science.

30:10.010 --> 30:12.090
That wasn't a thing for you then.
Yes, it was! Yes!

30:12.090 --> 30:15.020
You didn't do it
with Coxy then, did you?

30:15.020 --> 30:18.000
I didn't start knowing stuff
because I stood next to Brian Cox.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.020
I didn't learn science by osmosis,

30:20.020 --> 30:23.010
by standing next to Brian Cox
and, like, lick his sweat.

30:23.010 --> 30:25.040
Fuck you, Hugh, all right?

30:25.040 --> 30:28.010
You should be on my side
on the generational gap,

30:28.010 --> 30:30.040
if no other reason
in this show now.

30:30.040 --> 30:33.020
You and I are the only old people
left on this show so we have

30:33.020 --> 30:36.070
to stick up for each other cos
these young pricks are taking over.

30:36.070 --> 30:43.126
