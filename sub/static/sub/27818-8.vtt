WEBVTT

00:00.491 --> 00:03.760
If there were a hypothetical
compost vessel

00:03.771 --> 00:07.905
for... hypothetically... our doodie,

00:07.907 --> 00:09.507
would you hypothetically be into that?

00:09.509 --> 00:12.276
Sure! I been crashing on
friends' couches for a month,

00:12.278 --> 00:15.579
so I can literally move in
to-morr-ow, all right?

00:15.581 --> 00:16.980
Let me ask you this.

00:16.982 --> 00:19.016
When I take a shower,
will you keep me company?

00:19.018 --> 00:20.518
Not... Not <i>in</i> the shower,

00:20.520 --> 00:22.420
just, like, sit on the toilet
and talk to me?

00:22.422 --> 00:24.087
Okay.

00:24.089 --> 00:26.417
Okay, I just have one final question.

00:26.428 --> 00:30.503
What is your stance on the Olsen twins?

00:30.514 --> 00:33.096
Oh, my God, girl, the Olsen twins.

00:33.098 --> 00:35.466
It drives me nuts, you understand?

00:35.468 --> 00:37.701
- Part of it is like I feel sorry for them.
- Yes.

00:37.712 --> 00:39.471
But they also billionaires,
so I hate them.

00:39.482 --> 00:42.052
- Yes! Right.
- But, I mean, did they ask for this?

00:42.063 --> 00:43.633
- No, they did not. Okay?
- Unh-unh.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.508
Why would you have Uncle Jesse

00:45.510 --> 00:48.978
picking them up, kissing
them to get women?

00:48.980 --> 00:50.780
What woman sees that as a turn-on?

00:50.782 --> 00:52.415
What kind of move is this?

00:52.417 --> 00:54.751
Child, that whole set
is about to be Bill Cosby.

00:54.753 --> 00:56.118
- You hear me?
- Bizarre.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.087
Okay? MeToo moments every damn where.

00:58.089 --> 01:00.457
- That's it. I mean, give it to me.
- For real.

01:00.459 --> 01:01.758
- Lay it down.
- Hello?

01:01.760 --> 01:02.959
I mean, we vibing, right?

01:02.961 --> 01:04.394
- Child.
- Ye-e-es!

01:04.396 --> 01:05.595
- Beezy!
- All ri-i-ight!

01:05.597 --> 01:06.629
Ha ha ha!

01:06.631 --> 01:08.364
Ah, yes!

01:08.366 --> 01:11.032
Now, just tell me, what
room do I take, okay?

01:11.034 --> 01:14.370
Well, you have officially
secured yourself a backup offer.

01:14.372 --> 01:15.571
Backup?

01:15.573 --> 01:17.105
It's just that I have one more

01:17.107 --> 01:19.783
brown-eyed, goy-nosed, fat-assed,

01:19.794 --> 01:21.943
beautiful candidate left to explore.

01:21.945 --> 01:24.383
Well, girl, you've literally
just described <i> me.</i>

01:24.394 --> 01:26.778
Well, it looks like I have a type.

01:26.789 --> 01:28.384
I will get back to you in 24 hours.

01:28.386 --> 01:30.952
Can you make it 23? 'Cause
I really love this place.

01:32.155 --> 01:33.541
That's never happened before.

01:41.166 --> 01:42.463
I'm scared.

01:42.465 --> 01:43.931
I don't know how to say it

01:43.933 --> 01:47.528
or when or where or how exactly.

01:47.539 --> 01:50.705
<i>Ugh. You haven't told Ilana
you're moving to Colorado yet?!</i>

01:50.707 --> 01:52.473
<i>I do</i> not <i> envy you.</i>

01:52.475 --> 01:54.842
<i>When we told her we were
getting rid of her car,</i>

01:54.844 --> 01:57.812
- <i>we took her to see Savion Glover...</i>
- King of tap.

01:57.823 --> 02:01.315
<i>and we even snuck in a
backpack of sour cherry straws...</i>

02:01.317 --> 02:03.183
Those are her favorite... and she <i> still</i>

02:03.185 --> 02:05.158
wanted to declare legal emancipation.

02:05.169 --> 02:06.568
And you better tell that bitch soon

02:06.579 --> 02:08.389
because I'm only good
up to a certain point

02:08.390 --> 02:09.723
when it comes to keeping a secret.

02:09.726 --> 02:11.235
<i>Like, 12 hours ago,</i>

02:11.254 --> 02:14.318
<i>Eliot tells me he's having an affair...</i>

02:14.329 --> 02:15.441
<i>Can you believe this?...</i>

02:15.452 --> 02:18.465
<i>with a married man, married to a woman!</i>

02:18.467 --> 02:20.352
<i>He's a homewrecker, Abbi!</i>

02:20.363 --> 02:22.101
<i>Fuck. See? 12 hours.</i>

02:22.103 --> 02:23.770
<i>Ugh. I can't help myself.</i>

02:23.772 --> 02:25.472
Okay, okay, I-I'll do it today.

02:25.474 --> 02:28.074
<i>Butter her up... flowers,
weed, something special.</i>

02:28.076 --> 02:30.410
Just tell me it's gonna be okay.

02:30.412 --> 02:31.778
Bobbi?

02:31.780 --> 02:33.680
Bob, you're froz...

02:33.682 --> 02:37.851
Okay, I can see the ceiling fan
still moving in the background.

02:42.257 --> 02:44.057
Okay.

02:45.327 --> 02:46.559
What?

02:46.561 --> 02:48.428
Dude, what? Wait.

02:48.430 --> 02:52.265
We both bought each other a dozen roses?

02:54.135 --> 02:55.568
That is amazing. Can you believe...

02:55.570 --> 02:58.137
- Okay, these are for you.
- And those are for you.

02:58.139 --> 03:00.200
Can you believe we are
so psychically linked?

03:00.211 --> 03:02.583
No, and... and, luckily, nothing...

03:02.594 --> 03:06.118
you know, no space or time
or distance or anything...

03:06.129 --> 03:09.215
would ever change that or take
that away. Not even death.

03:09.217 --> 03:11.550
- That's hot.
- Yeah.

03:11.552 --> 03:13.752
So, today, we are going to do something

03:13.754 --> 03:16.155
that you have wanted
to do forever, baby.

03:16.166 --> 03:17.202
What?

03:18.093 --> 03:20.126
"Sleep No More"!

03:20.128 --> 03:21.594
Are you serious?

03:22.864 --> 03:25.764
God, I love living in New York City.
You just... You can't beat it.

03:25.766 --> 03:29.007
You get to be physically near the
cutting edge of art and culture

03:29.018 --> 03:32.671
and then, just a mere decade later,
actually afford to experience it.

03:32.673 --> 03:34.104
But wait.

03:34.115 --> 03:36.074
Aren't you gonna be too scared to go?

03:36.076 --> 03:38.198
I mean, I'm excited. I am also scared,

03:38.209 --> 03:40.059
but it is gonna be scary, right?

03:40.070 --> 03:41.905
It's not intended to be scary.

03:41.916 --> 03:44.435
It's kind of like interactive,
modern version of "Macbeth."

03:44.446 --> 03:46.184
Ooh! Shakespeare.

03:46.186 --> 03:49.287
I <i> love</i> Shakespeare, all his stuff.

03:50.591 --> 03:52.457
God, Shakespeare was fucking cool,

03:52.459 --> 03:55.027
'cause he was bisexual as hell, dawg.

03:55.029 --> 03:58.463
Also, you see visible vulva
and penis in this show.

03:59.699 --> 04:01.500
This is gonna be <i>so</i> good,

04:01.502 --> 04:03.301
because I want to go
into this new experience

04:03.303 --> 04:06.004
because, like, I want to
be uncomfortable to grow.

04:06.006 --> 04:07.920
Beesh, I hear deesh,

04:07.931 --> 04:10.942
'cause I believe in us growing together,

04:10.944 --> 04:12.877
no matter what form that may take.

04:12.879 --> 04:15.380
Me too, dude.

04:15.382 --> 04:18.216
Together forever!

04:23.120 --> 04:24.396
Petticoats, please.

04:24.407 --> 04:27.159
If you could keep these
vertical, that would be great.

04:27.161 --> 04:28.825
And, hey, is there a particular

04:28.827 --> 04:30.394
penis-and-vulva viewing room?

04:30.396 --> 04:33.030
I-I was told there would be
visible vulva.

04:33.032 --> 04:35.299
Uh, you know, this is more of a...

04:35.301 --> 04:38.302
this is honestly more of like
a follow-the-action,

04:38.304 --> 04:39.970
choose-your-own-adventure type show.

04:39.972 --> 04:41.505
Just follow the rooms.

04:41.507 --> 04:43.140
I bet it's multiple rooms.

04:43.142 --> 04:44.442
Yeah.

04:46.145 --> 04:48.045
It <i> is</i> scary, see?

04:48.047 --> 04:50.181
20 people on one elevator, yes.

04:50.183 --> 04:51.515
Actually terrifying.

04:52.718 --> 04:55.018
Okay.

05:01.193 --> 05:03.993
Things aren't always as they seem here.

05:03.995 --> 05:05.861
Trust no one.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.402
I trust <i> you.</i>

05:10.413 --> 05:11.568
I was right there.

05:11.570 --> 05:13.608
- Me?
- No, not you.

05:13.619 --> 05:14.651
God!

05:14.662 --> 05:17.307
Jesus. You... I trust you.

05:17.309 --> 05:18.941
- Me?
- Oh, my God!

05:18.943 --> 05:20.243
No! What?!

05:20.245 --> 05:21.411
Are you bothering this girl?

05:21.413 --> 05:22.512
Ilana?

05:22.514 --> 05:24.692
Okay. God, let's go. Come on.

05:26.137 --> 05:27.883
Oh, cute.

05:27.885 --> 05:30.019
Oh, my God.

05:30.021 --> 05:31.387
Okay, I can't look.

05:31.389 --> 05:33.256
What do you think's gonna happen to her?

05:33.258 --> 05:35.091
Ab, if this is too scary
for you, we can go.

05:35.093 --> 05:36.758
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no, no.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.427
Yeah, it's just
kind of scary not knowing,

05:38.429 --> 05:40.262
like, what's gonna happen next.

05:41.599 --> 05:44.566
We gotta do new stuff and expand.

05:44.568 --> 05:46.101
It's the best part of life!

05:46.103 --> 05:48.770
Even if we are scared and
terrified, we gotta do it...

05:48.772 --> 05:50.739
like, new parts of the world, new ideas,

05:50.741 --> 05:52.593
new... new parts of the... the country.

05:52.604 --> 05:54.309
- Ooh, like Queens.
- Yeah, yeah.

05:54.311 --> 05:56.211
Or, like, further wherever, you know?

05:56.213 --> 05:57.579
Like, I'm in, dude.

05:57.581 --> 06:00.752
Girl, I love inner. Go in. Go deep.

06:00.763 --> 06:02.773
And, you know, when your
best friend is by your side,

06:02.784 --> 06:04.219
there's nothing to fear.

06:07.090 --> 06:08.156
Oh, man.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.993
Ew, do you smell that?

06:11.995 --> 06:14.763
Yeah, someone must have
crop-dusted us all, huh?

06:14.765 --> 06:16.464
Brilliant theatrical choice!

06:16.466 --> 06:18.767
It was me.

06:18.769 --> 06:19.834
Wait.

06:22.505 --> 06:24.205
Oh, my God. Shitfuck.

06:24.207 --> 06:25.725
Nurses are never good.

06:25.736 --> 06:28.442
Although I do love the long-lost
art of letter-writing.

06:28.444 --> 06:30.611
I'm just like, "Where are
the chills and/or thrills?"

06:30.613 --> 06:32.346
You know, I want to be
either really scared

06:32.348 --> 06:34.448
- or really horny.
- Are you kidding me?

06:34.450 --> 06:36.280
This is the creepiest
fucking thing I've ever seen.

06:36.291 --> 06:38.096
Oh, my God!

06:38.107 --> 06:39.907
I don't want to go on!

06:41.290 --> 06:43.190
Yeah, it's working.

06:43.192 --> 06:44.658
It's working.

06:46.062 --> 06:49.329
Gorgeous cursive.

06:49.331 --> 06:52.632
Yes! Candy! Okay, jackpot.

06:52.634 --> 06:54.401
Oh, my God.

06:54.403 --> 06:56.070
Except...

06:56.072 --> 06:58.338
I know what's going on. This is like...

06:58.340 --> 07:00.340
What if this is like a little sweet spot

07:00.342 --> 07:01.909
so they... you let your guard down

07:01.911 --> 07:03.461
'cause you're, like,
surrounded by candy,

07:03.472 --> 07:05.248
and then this is where
they really hit you

07:05.259 --> 07:07.715
with, like, the terrifying,
like, terrible stuff.

07:07.717 --> 07:10.184
Chill out. Nothing
terrible's gonna happen.

07:10.186 --> 07:13.120
- I mean, you don't know that, but...
- In fact...

07:13.122 --> 07:16.022
I know how to make
- a sweet memory even sweeter.

07:16.024 --> 07:17.590
Okay.

07:17.592 --> 07:21.227
Abbi, you are the best thing

07:21.229 --> 07:22.517
that's ever come into my life,

07:22.528 --> 07:24.063
and I know I'm taking a big swing here,

07:24.065 --> 07:25.765
but I'm just gonna go for it.

07:25.767 --> 07:28.167
So, as I look for a roommate
to replace Jaimé,

07:28.169 --> 07:29.568
I'm thinking, like,

07:29.570 --> 07:31.337
"Abbi and I spend
a lot of time together.

07:31.339 --> 07:33.368
"We get along."

07:33.379 --> 07:36.575
Why not spend more time together?

07:36.577 --> 07:39.178
I'm talking covering each
other's rent once in a while.

07:39.180 --> 07:42.014
I'm talking knowing what
each other's orgasms sound like

07:42.016 --> 07:44.083
instead of merely fantasizing about it.

07:45.120 --> 07:48.653
Abbi Gary Anna Abrams...

07:51.258 --> 07:54.059
will you be my roommate?

07:58.465 --> 07:59.831
Uh, I...

07:59.833 --> 08:01.199
You know what?

08:01.201 --> 08:03.135
Don't even worry about it.
Never happened. Uh, I...

08:03.146 --> 08:04.602
I-I get it.

08:04.604 --> 08:06.437
I acknowledged the swing-size,

08:06.439 --> 08:08.506
and I even secured a backup offer.

08:08.508 --> 08:10.976
She's very fucking cool,
so it's... it's chill.

08:10.978 --> 08:12.244
It's... It's chill. I really...

08:12.246 --> 08:13.544
It's cool.

08:13.546 --> 08:15.213
No. No, no, no... Wait, wait, wait.

08:15.215 --> 08:16.581
Dude, not... It's...

08:17.717 --> 08:19.317
Fuck. Okay.

08:19.319 --> 08:21.753
You're scaring me.

08:21.755 --> 08:24.721
I-I didn't want to tell you
when we were in here.

08:24.723 --> 08:25.890
All right, all right.

08:25.892 --> 08:27.658
I-I was going to tell you today.

08:27.660 --> 08:30.594
Um, I got accepted

08:30.596 --> 08:33.964
to an artists' residency program

08:33.966 --> 08:38.202
in Boulder...

08:38.203 --> 08:41.438
Colorado.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.441
And I'm gonna go.

08:45.912 --> 08:49.379
I was, um, gonna sell my shit

08:49.381 --> 08:55.285
and use this as an opportunity to move.

08:58.225 --> 08:59.858
- What...
- Ilana!

08:59.860 --> 09:01.426
- the fuck...
- Dude? Ilana?

09:01.428 --> 09:03.261
- are you talking about?!
- Ow!

09:03.263 --> 09:04.596
Ilana, um...

09:04.598 --> 09:07.398
We need to get you into therapy today.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.735
This is an emergency, okay?!

09:09.737 --> 09:11.069
This is an emergency!

09:11.071 --> 09:12.604
Okay, fun fact-o, Ilana...

09:12.606 --> 09:15.774
Did you know that you
could fly to Boulder

09:15.776 --> 09:17.575
on a connecting flight through O'Hare

09:17.577 --> 09:20.860
with a layover in Pittsburgh for $42?
I mean...

09:20.871 --> 09:23.539
I had never looked up how
to fly to "Boulder."

09:23.550 --> 09:24.602
Ew!

09:24.613 --> 09:26.012
- All right, all right.
- O'Hare?!

09:26.023 --> 09:27.452
I don't know what that is!

09:27.454 --> 09:28.486
Is that Gaelic?!

09:28.488 --> 09:29.587
This is a little...

09:29.589 --> 09:30.956
Google, what is Boulder?!

09:30.958 --> 09:32.190
Jesus!

09:32.192 --> 09:33.725
- No!
- God.

09:33.727 --> 09:35.381
You didn't even tell me
you were applying.

09:35.392 --> 09:37.398
Do you not consider me someone
to talk shit through with?

09:37.409 --> 09:40.931
- Are we not partners in that way?
- Of course I do, Ilana.

09:40.933 --> 09:43.468
You're my only friend.

09:45.605 --> 09:47.754
Well, I guess you've been
stuck with me for awhile,

09:47.765 --> 09:49.657
but not anymore.

09:49.668 --> 09:51.976
No, dude, no. I-I <i>don't</i> feel that way.

09:51.978 --> 09:53.944
Ilana, wait. Just wait.

09:59.252 --> 10:01.118
Oh, my goodness.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.887
Ilana?

10:02.889 --> 10:04.656
Yeah. Vulva.

10:04.658 --> 10:07.958
You have ruined the best part of
this interactive production for me.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.093
Not now.

10:09.095 --> 10:11.461
I'm sorry, dude. I-I'm sorry.

10:11.463 --> 10:14.799
I feel really stuck in my life
right now, okay?

10:14.801 --> 10:16.000
Nope. Nothing.

10:16.002 --> 10:17.467
I need a change.

10:17.469 --> 10:19.469
This is just like you with grad school.

10:19.471 --> 10:21.806
I mean, you were settling into a track

10:21.808 --> 10:23.740
and figuring out your career.

10:23.742 --> 10:25.642
Yeah, but I picked a school in New York.

10:25.644 --> 10:28.813
I factored you in.
I <i> always</i> factor you in.

10:28.815 --> 10:30.815
Otherwise, I would've talked
to you about it.

10:30.817 --> 10:34.451
I know. I-I know. I-I'm sorry.

10:34.453 --> 10:37.354
Well, does... does anybody else know?

10:37.356 --> 10:41.257
I mean, I just talked to my mom
and... and your mom.

10:41.259 --> 10:43.327
You told my mom?!

10:43.329 --> 10:45.028
That is <i>so</i> violating to me.

10:46.264 --> 10:50.166
I'm sorry. Just hold on a second.

10:50.168 --> 10:51.868
Ilana?

10:57.743 --> 11:01.164
What a bitch.

11:05.406 --> 11:08.051
Ilana, come on.

11:08.053 --> 11:12.755
I... can... not believe...

11:12.757 --> 11:15.524
that you would not tell me this shit

11:15.526 --> 11:17.593
if there was even a chance of you going.

11:17.595 --> 11:21.430
Dude, I was scared. I-I
mean, I'm still scared.

11:21.432 --> 11:23.432
Do you think that I want to leave you?

11:23.434 --> 11:26.034
No, I almost wish I didn't even get in

11:26.036 --> 11:27.503
so I wouldn't even have to do this.

11:27.505 --> 11:28.604
Ha ha ha.

11:28.606 --> 11:29.805
Like you're not gonna get in

11:29.807 --> 11:31.741
to some art program you apply to.

11:31.743 --> 11:36.144
You are the best artist
in the world of all time!

11:36.146 --> 11:37.913
No, I'm not.

11:37.915 --> 11:39.882
Are you kidding me? No, I'm not.

11:39.884 --> 11:42.518
I need to go out and do this thing

11:42.520 --> 11:44.854
and... and have an audience
that's more than just you

11:44.856 --> 11:47.789
and... and my parents.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.557
This is the first opportunity I have had

11:49.559 --> 11:53.327
to finally live and breathe art

11:53.329 --> 11:55.229
rather than breathing in,

11:55.231 --> 11:57.899
like, leftover prosciutto-wrapped dates

11:57.901 --> 12:00.368
that I stole from my catering gig.

12:00.370 --> 12:02.069
They're so good, though.

12:02.071 --> 12:04.572
Yeah, I know. That's why
I continually take them,

12:04.574 --> 12:06.574
but, I mean, then rats come,

12:06.576 --> 12:08.643
and I just, like, haven't
figured out how to...

12:08.645 --> 12:09.911
It wouldn't be an issue

12:09.913 --> 12:11.713
and you wouldn't have to leave New York

12:11.715 --> 12:13.415
if you just flushed them down the toilet

12:13.417 --> 12:14.783
or wrapped them in tinfoil

12:14.785 --> 12:16.551
and then put them
in a five-gallon Ziploc.

12:16.553 --> 12:18.620
It's not about me not knowing
how to flush them.

12:18.622 --> 12:19.921
It's not about that.

12:19.923 --> 12:21.655
I mean, it is a teeny bit about, like,

12:21.657 --> 12:23.657
the methodical strategies

12:23.659 --> 12:25.793
in which we have to avoid rats.

12:25.795 --> 12:27.661
For the past eight years,

12:27.663 --> 12:32.099
I have cleaned out
- hundreds of people's pubes

12:32.101 --> 12:33.600
out of toilet bowls.

12:33.602 --> 12:38.772
So many strangers... so many...

12:38.774 --> 12:40.274
have thrown up on me.

12:40.276 --> 12:43.610
You do get thrown up on
an exorbitant amount.

12:43.612 --> 12:45.612
Yeah.

12:45.614 --> 12:50.151
Dude, I am 30 years old.

12:50.153 --> 12:51.852
I'm done with New York.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.687
Yeah.

12:54.689 --> 12:56.489
I get it.

12:56.491 --> 12:58.558
I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.793
I'm really... I'm gross.

13:00.795 --> 13:03.463
I made this all about me,
and it's not about me.

13:03.465 --> 13:05.698
But I thought you would've told me,

13:05.700 --> 13:07.834
but, you know, I just need time.

13:07.836 --> 13:09.769
I need time to process this, I...

13:09.771 --> 13:12.439
process the thought of you leaving.

13:12.441 --> 13:14.874
Once I have that for a few months,

13:14.876 --> 13:16.843
you know, whatever... see my therapist,

13:16.845 --> 13:18.511
double up for a little while,

13:18.513 --> 13:20.646
and... and push it through a little bit.

13:20.648 --> 13:22.983
Just a little time, and it'll be okay.

13:22.985 --> 13:26.319
I'll be there to support you, I promise.

13:28.755 --> 13:30.022
So, speaking of...

13:30.024 --> 13:32.324
- Sorry.
- Speaking of time...

13:32.326 --> 13:34.793
Speaking of... Uh, speaking of time...

13:38.532 --> 13:44.069
So, the... the program
starts in two weeks.

13:51.078 --> 13:53.940
What... are... you talking about?!

13:53.951 --> 13:55.314
Don't leave!

13:55.316 --> 13:56.482
Oh, my God. Stop doing this.

13:56.484 --> 13:58.350
We've had years together, bitch!

13:58.352 --> 14:00.419
- You crazy fucking bitch!
- Holy shit.

14:00.421 --> 14:03.154
- What are you talking about?!
- Ilana, stop. Ilana?

14:05.000 --> 14:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:12.682 --> 14:15.450
So, uh, what do you want to do now?

14:15.461 --> 14:17.461
I think we should just go home.

14:17.463 --> 14:20.530
Come on, Ilana. We can't
end today like this.

14:20.532 --> 14:22.031
It's still early.

14:27.706 --> 14:29.439
Thank you.

14:29.441 --> 14:31.174
Wow. Oh, my God.

14:31.176 --> 14:34.310
I need something in my stomach so bad.

14:39.817 --> 14:42.518
Are you not... you're not into it?

14:42.520 --> 14:44.553
I'm just not that hungry.

14:44.555 --> 14:47.190
Ilana...

14:47.192 --> 14:48.491
you are the best friend

14:48.493 --> 14:51.694
I have ever had in my whole life.

14:51.696 --> 14:55.031
And I know that everybody is leaving.

14:55.033 --> 14:57.466
I'm sorry. I know that this is, like,

14:57.468 --> 14:59.702
the worst timing.

14:59.704 --> 15:03.672
I just... Dude, I...

15:03.674 --> 15:06.342
I need to, like, change my life.

15:06.344 --> 15:09.978
I could do this in New York
with you forever.

15:09.980 --> 15:12.080
Exactly.

15:12.082 --> 15:16.385
I don't want to.

15:16.387 --> 15:19.422
Not because of you... not because
I don't want to do this with you.

15:19.424 --> 15:22.024
It's just, I'm gonna be illustrating

15:22.026 --> 15:23.526
all day, every day.

15:23.528 --> 15:26.762
Like, all the time, I'm
gonna be immersed in it.

15:26.764 --> 15:30.900
I <i> need</i> you to be with me
for this next journey, dude.

15:30.902 --> 15:34.570
I... Like, I need that.

15:34.572 --> 15:37.640
You ruined "Sleep No More" for me.

15:37.642 --> 15:40.943
I didn't even get to get off
during the orgy scene.

15:40.945 --> 15:44.078
Get off? In the... In the room?

15:44.080 --> 15:47.582
People do. It's really dark.

15:47.584 --> 15:52.720
You know, Ab, I've always
looked up to you,

15:52.722 --> 15:54.923
and I've always admired you

15:54.925 --> 15:57.892
for being a deep and mysterious queen,

15:57.894 --> 16:01.195
but I'm gonna be...

16:01.197 --> 16:03.264
right there with you.

16:03.266 --> 16:06.968
I'm gonna watch you and...

16:06.970 --> 16:10.104
let you fly, or whatever.

16:10.106 --> 16:16.176
I know that this residency
is gonna be a good experi...

16:16.178 --> 16:17.711
Ew.

16:19.047 --> 16:21.314
- Mm. Wow. Sorry.
- You all right?

16:21.316 --> 16:24.918
What I mean to say is that I know

16:24.920 --> 16:27.955
that this experience is necessary

16:27.957 --> 16:31.057
for your growth. Ew.

16:34.964 --> 16:36.029
Okay.

16:36.031 --> 16:37.130
Sorry. Sorry.

16:37.132 --> 16:38.331
You all right? Okay.

16:40.102 --> 16:41.167
I'm really proud of you.

16:44.039 --> 16:45.806
Thank you so much, dude.

16:45.808 --> 16:48.074
That means the world to me, really.

16:48.076 --> 16:50.276
Listen, Ilana, you're gonna become,

16:50.278 --> 16:52.845
like, this badass therapist
who teaches people to grow

16:52.847 --> 16:54.807
the way you helped me grow.

16:54.818 --> 16:57.111
I mean, you're gonna teach them
how to feel their feelings

16:57.122 --> 16:59.352
and how to do sex the right way.

16:59.354 --> 17:02.122
- There's no right way.
- See?

17:02.124 --> 17:03.823
This is what I'm talking about.

17:03.825 --> 17:05.858
Can I ask one thing of you?

17:05.859 --> 17:08.560
Anything, dude. Whatever.

17:08.563 --> 17:11.531
I want more of your hair.

17:13.468 --> 17:15.468
I want a long-ass tail for sniffing.

17:20.766 --> 17:22.199
I-I shape my phone wigs

17:22.210 --> 17:24.377
when the train gets stuck
between stations.

17:24.378 --> 17:26.310
Um, so...

17:26.313 --> 17:28.880
Okay. Sure.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.683
I-I-I would love to.

17:31.685 --> 17:33.218
Ab.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.454
I'm not talking about shavings.

17:35.456 --> 17:36.855
The root.

17:36.857 --> 17:40.025
You should feel metal
on your scalp skin.

17:40.027 --> 17:41.660
Okay.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.802
Thank you.

17:52.773 --> 17:54.306
Okay.

17:59.046 --> 18:02.646
Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know
when the sun's gonna set,

18:02.648 --> 18:04.615
but maybe we can, like,
walk a little bit down...

18:04.617 --> 18:06.584
Okay.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.718
Talk soon.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.487
Okay, handshake.

18:17.697 --> 18:21.365
Yeah, so, you can move in
straight up tomorrow.

18:21.367 --> 18:25.203
<i>Yes! Amazing! Thank you!</i>

18:25.205 --> 18:27.705
And I'm sorry about that
backup-offer shit before.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.673
I promise I will be a normal roommate.

18:29.675 --> 18:32.310
<i>Oh, I-I forgot to tell you
one small thing...</i>

18:32.312 --> 18:36.946
<i>Well, actually, two really big things.</i>

18:36.948 --> 18:38.848
<i>I have two Great Danes.</i>

18:38.850 --> 18:40.717
<i>Is that cool?</i>

18:40.719 --> 18:42.586
Yeah.

18:42.588 --> 18:44.754
<i>Yes! I'm so glad you love dogs.</i>

18:44.756 --> 18:47.124
Later.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.400
Okay.

19:16.379 --> 19:19.515
Oh, my God. Lookit, they love you!

19:21.128 --> 19:23.394
Okay, Beyoncé, Jay-Z, let's go,
come on, come on.

19:23.396 --> 19:24.729
Come with Mama.

19:25.394 --> 19:26.526
Come on, let's go.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.244
What?

19:34.255 --> 19:36.625
<i>Okay, um, Ilana, please don't hang up.</i>

19:36.636 --> 19:38.276
<i>I-I know you need space right now,</i>

19:38.287 --> 19:39.917
<i>and... and I really want
to respect that,</i>

19:39.928 --> 19:42.623
<i>but you have asked me this...</i>

19:42.625 --> 19:46.560
<i>hundreds of times, literally,
since the moment I met you,</i>

19:46.571 --> 19:50.440
<i>and it looks like today is the day.</i>

19:53.936 --> 19:55.769
I'm gonna show you my poop.

19:57.306 --> 19:59.306
Oh, my God.

19:59.308 --> 20:00.807
This means so much to me.

20:00.809 --> 20:03.343
Okay.

20:03.345 --> 20:05.845
Here we go.

20:10.086 --> 20:11.518
<i>Fuck!</i>

20:11.520 --> 20:14.020
Queen! You <i> must</i> be an Ashkenazi Jew

20:14.022 --> 20:16.590
'cause you are lactose in-toler-ant!

20:16.592 --> 20:18.125
- Right?
- <i>No way could that have been</i>

20:18.127 --> 20:19.726
<i>all in your stomach at one time!</i>

20:19.728 --> 20:22.027
<i>It was definitely exiting your esophagus</i>

20:22.029 --> 20:23.862
<i>as it was entering your small intestine.</i>

20:23.864 --> 20:25.198
- <i>Whoo!</i>
- I do feel lighter.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.633
<i>Hoo! Thank you. Wow.</i>

20:27.635 --> 20:30.603
Ilana, I needed that to work, dude.

20:30.605 --> 20:33.072
<i>I am so sorry, and I knew</i>

20:33.074 --> 20:36.375
that showing you my poop
would cheer you up.

20:36.377 --> 20:38.177
♪ My poop ♪

20:38.179 --> 20:40.580
♪ My poop, my poop ♪

20:40.582 --> 20:42.348
♪ My poop ♪

20:42.350 --> 20:44.005
- <i>You sound good.</i>
- Thanks.

20:44.016 --> 20:46.252
I-I did it a few times
before I called you.

20:46.254 --> 20:49.021
You know, I-I guess this distance thing

20:49.023 --> 20:51.090
could make us closer in some ways.

20:51.092 --> 20:52.691
Thank you for saying that.

20:52.693 --> 20:54.827
Ab.

20:54.829 --> 20:56.328
Can I see it one more time?

20:56.330 --> 20:57.862
Okay, one more time.

20:57.864 --> 20:59.297
And then I really have to flush,

20:59.299 --> 21:01.533

Ilana, I need to talk to you
about something.

21:17.072 --> 21:20.534
I got accepted into
an artists' residency program

21:20.545 --> 21:24.110
in Boulder, Colorado.

21:24.112 --> 21:28.261
Ilana, say something!
For crying out loud, dude!

21:28.272 --> 21:29.404
Talk to me!
