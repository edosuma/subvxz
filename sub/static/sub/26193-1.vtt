here, isn't it?

00:13.981 --> 00:15.614

It makes me realize
how lucky I am.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.052
Stop.

00:21.766 --> 00:22.766
Devin, I...

00:22.790 --> 00:25.391
Alexis Ann Chambers...

00:28.229 --> 00:30.963
I loved you from the first
moment that I saw you.

00:31.065 --> 00:32.965
Devin, please...

00:33.067 --> 00:35.901
Will you marry me?

00:36.003 --> 00:37.169
I...

00:38.773 --> 00:40.439
I don't know what to say.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.775
Yes, this is where you say yes.

00:42.877 --> 00:45.144
Devin, I'm not ready
to get married.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.279
Or even engaged.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.947
I'm sorry.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.150
But we love each other.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.518
I'm going off to college...

00:52.620 --> 00:54.540
Okay well if it's the
distance, I'll go with you.

00:54.564 --> 00:56.255
I'll work whatever job.

00:56.357 --> 00:59.324
I'll make coffee,
I'll scrub toilets.

00:59.427 --> 01:01.093
We need to be together.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.595
I think we need to live
our own lives for awhile.

01:03.697 --> 01:06.365
This doesn't mean it
ends forever, okay?

01:06.467 --> 01:07.766
I don't believe this.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.301
I think this will
be good for me.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.970
For us.

01:12.073 --> 01:13.105
This is a mistake.

01:13.207 --> 01:16.408
Devin, you know how
much I care about you.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.110

Just that you should

16:50.977 --> 16:52.143
<i>Here she is.</i>

16:55.615 --> 16:58.349
It's a pleasure
meeting you, Emily.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.917
The suit's a bit much.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.686
You're not going to
be rude right now.

17:01.788 --> 17:05.455
So, I hear you're having some
problems with your Chem class?

17:05.558 --> 17:06.891
That's what they tell me.

17:06.992 --> 17:09.926
What specifically do you
seem to be struggling with?

17:10.030 --> 17:11.462
All.

17:11.564 --> 17:15.599
Okay, well what is your
class currently focused on?

17:15.702 --> 17:17.402
I don't know, they're
talking about like,

17:17.503 --> 17:18.803
mass and stuff?

17:18.905 --> 17:22.373
Okay, so conservation of
mass, mass into action, etc.

17:22.474 --> 17:23.708
That sounds familiar.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.609
Well you're in luck,
because that just happens

17:25.634 --> 17:28.046
to be my specialty.

17:28.147 --> 17:30.381
Sweetie, why don't you
go get that assignment?

17:30.483 --> 17:32.884
Before we get started, do you
mind if I use the restroom?

17:32.986 --> 17:34.118
Yeah, of course.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.100
Right upstairs, you can
use the master bathroom.

17:36.124 --> 17:37.890
Okay got it, thanks.

17:40.794 --> 17:42.527
He'll do.

17:46.332 --> 17:49.700
Stupid! Stupid!

17:49.803 --> 17:52.403
Stupid!

19:02.942 --> 19:05.543
All right, how're we doing?

19:05.645 --> 19:09.714
Did you get on the
ammonia equation?

19:33.439 --> 19:35.506
Okay, almost.

19:35.608 --> 19:38.609
You just forgot to
carry the coefficient.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.044
All this lingo.

19:40.146 --> 19:42.947
It doesn't makes sense to me.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.216
You're a musician, right?

19:45.318 --> 19:46.951
I heard you playing
when we got here.

19:47.053 --> 19:49.120
What does that have
to do with anything?

19:49.222 --> 19:51.589
For chemical reactions to
work, they have to sync up,

19:51.691 --> 19:54.392
just like a good song.

19:54.494 --> 19:58.196
So in this case, think
of hydrogen as lyrics

19:58.298 --> 20:00.431
and nitrogen as melody.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.266
All right, just listen:
this equation,

20:02.368 --> 20:04.035
it isn't balanced.

20:04.137 --> 20:06.037
And when an imbalance occurs,

20:06.139 --> 20:10.775
you use a coefficient
and it balances it out.

20:10.877 --> 20:15.313
Think of coefficients as,
like a killer guitar solo.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.462
That's it.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.464
That's actually really good.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.466
Oh my god, it worked?

20:35.568 --> 20:36.434
[Doorbell ringing] - Yeah.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.202
I got it!

20:43.409 --> 20:45.843
Hello!

20:45.945 --> 20:47.345
<i>Hey hey.</i>

20:47.447 --> 20:49.447
<i>I've been working on a
song, it's just for you.</i>

20:49.549 --> 20:50.815
<i>Really?</i>

20:50.917 --> 20:52.149
Hey.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.784
You guys taking a little break?

20:53.886 --> 20:56.153
She has a visitor.

20:56.256 --> 20:56.921
Really?

20:57.023 --> 20:58.789
Oh, hey.

20:58.891 --> 20:59.924
Hey.

21:00.026 --> 21:02.760
This is Emily's tutor, Devin.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.182
I thought her tutor
would be like,

21:04.264 --> 21:07.098
an old lady or something.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.360
Sweetie, you can't have guests

21:08.384 --> 21:09.533
while you're studying, okay?

21:09.636 --> 21:11.102
We're done.

21:11.204 --> 21:12.837
Is that right?

21:15.875 --> 21:17.942
Yes actually, we are.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.811
We had a really
productive first meeting.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.480
Well that's great!

21:22.582 --> 21:24.142
Yeah I invited Steve
to stay for dinner.

21:24.166 --> 21:25.383
We're just gonna go set up

21:25.485 --> 21:26.805
and work on some
chords and stuff.

21:26.829 --> 21:27.829
Oh, okay!

21:27.920 --> 21:29.787
<i>I can't wait to hear this song!</i>

21:32.959 --> 21:34.859
So how bad is it?

21:34.961 --> 21:36.360
She's smart.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.963
She won't have any problems
grasping the concepts

21:39.065 --> 21:41.132
with just a little
bit more work.

21:41.234 --> 21:42.634
It just needs to
happen by midterms.

21:42.658 --> 21:43.968
Is that possible?

21:44.070 --> 21:46.637
She needs to focus and just
block everything else out.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.873
Okay, so maybe she just
needs to put band practice

21:48.975 --> 21:50.808
off for a little bit.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.010
I'll have to break
that news to her.

21:53.112 --> 21:55.379
What news?

21:55.481 --> 21:57.381
Oh, uh...

21:57.483 --> 21:59.417
we'll talk about it later.

21:59.519 --> 22:00.751
What's the big secret?

22:00.853 --> 22:02.086
Just tell me.

22:02.188 --> 22:05.222
Just that until
midterms are over,

22:05.325 --> 22:09.093
we're thinking you should
cut back on other things.

22:09.195 --> 22:10.328
You mean the band?

22:10.430 --> 22:11.228
Ms. Armstrong...

22:11.331 --> 22:14.765
Yeah, just for a little while.

22:14.867 --> 22:17.168
Did you make her say this?

22:17.270 --> 22:20.438
No, this is my decision.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.700
We're not going to have an
argument about it right now,

22:22.724 --> 22:23.741
okay sweetie?

22:23.843 --> 22:24.909
Then don't make me do it!

22:25.011 --> 22:27.078
Let's have a private
conversation.

22:27.180 --> 22:28.913
Me and you, upstairs.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.581
We're just gonna upstairs.

22:30.683 --> 22:31.449
Mom...

22:31.551 --> 22:33.017
Upstairs!

22:34.153 --> 22:35.673
Sorry guys, you can
let yourselves out.

22:35.697 --> 22:37.163
<i>Mom!</i>

22:46.666 --> 22:48.146
I saw the way you
were looking at her.

22:48.170 --> 22:49.800
What?

22:49.902 --> 22:54.405
It's okay, she's kinda hot.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.807
I don't know what you're
talking about, man.

22:56.909 --> 23:00.177
I'm her tutor.

23:00.279 --> 23:02.113
Whatever, man.

23:14.204 --> 23:15.404
I don't know what else to say!

23:15.428 --> 23:17.428
This is so stupid!

23:17.530 --> 23:20.164
Okay first of all,
academics are not stupid.

23:20.266 --> 23:21.506
I'm not asking you, sweetheart,

23:21.567 --> 23:23.334
to give up music for
the rest of your life,

23:23.436 --> 23:25.736
I'm just saying put it
aside for a few weeks.

23:25.838 --> 23:27.638
But they are counting on me!

23:27.740 --> 23:28.839
Who's counting on you?

23:28.941 --> 23:30.241
You're playing in
Steve's garage.

23:30.343 --> 23:31.776
No, we're not!

23:31.878 --> 23:34.238
Steve found a studio that is
putting on a new band showcase.

23:34.340 --> 23:35.620
Well, that's gonna have to wait.

23:35.675 --> 23:36.447
Mom!

23:36.549 --> 23:38.109
Trust me, there will
be other showcases.

23:38.133 --> 23:39.583
No, you cannot do this!

23:39.685 --> 23:41.830
I can do it and I am doing it,
you have to wait till midterms

23:41.854 --> 23:43.754
are over and then you can
go back to the band.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.089
This is so unfair!

23:45.191 --> 23:47.071
It's very reasonable! I'm
being very reasonable!

23:47.095 --> 23:48.759
No, you are being
completely unreasonable!

23:48.861 --> 23:51.162
This is my shot, Mom!

23:56.269 --> 23:59.003
So did you get your mom to cave?

23:59.105 --> 24:00.105
But we've gotta practice!

24:00.206 --> 24:01.972
I know.

24:02.074 --> 24:03.707
Well, can you sneak
away anyways?

24:03.810 --> 24:05.476
I have the tutor tonight.

24:05.578 --> 24:06.977
But maybe he can cover for me.

24:07.079 --> 24:09.046
Doubt it. That guy's into you.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.268
He wants you all to himself.

24:10.292 --> 24:12.349
You're so full of it.

24:12.452 --> 24:13.217
If you say so.

24:13.319 --> 24:14.885
When can you sneak away?

24:14.987 --> 24:17.888
I mean technically after
my tutor session tonight.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.390
My mom's got a date.

24:19.492 --> 24:20.972
But by the time I'd
get to your house,

24:20.996 --> 24:23.727
that puts me in the
police-getting-called window.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.297
But I think I can
work with that.

24:28.077 --> 24:29.077
<i>She's in her office.</i>

24:29.101 --> 24:30.401
<i>Okay, thanks.</i>

24:38.945 --> 24:40.411
Hey...

24:42.248 --> 24:43.347
You okay?

24:43.449 --> 24:45.416
I don't feel good.

24:45.518 --> 24:48.085
You don't feel warm.

24:49.121 --> 24:52.223
There's a bug going
around school.

24:52.325 --> 24:55.392
Like half the school
was out today.

24:55.495 --> 24:57.061
Maybe I should stay
home with you.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.163
No, I'll be alright.

24:59.265 --> 25:03.000
I just want to go home, do
my homework and go to sleep.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.903
Well, what about tutoring?

25:06.005 --> 25:07.338
Can we postpone?

25:07.440 --> 25:09.607
Just reschedule for the weekend?

25:09.709 --> 25:10.841
Yeah.

25:10.943 --> 25:11.709
Okay.

25:11.811 --> 25:13.911
Thanks mom, you're the best.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.847
Okay, feel better, sweetie.

25:22.288 --> 25:26.023
[Cell phone ringing]

25:27.360 --> 25:28.626
This is Devin.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.060
<i>Hi Devin.</i>

25:30.162 --> 25:31.795
<i>Listen, Emily's not
feeling well today,</i>

25:31.898 --> 25:35.432
<i>so we are going to
cancel the session.</i>

25:35.535 --> 25:37.601
<i>I'm really sorry for
the short notice.</i>

25:37.703 --> 25:39.236
Oh yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.

25:39.338 --> 25:41.138
Well I hope she feels better.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.907
<i>Thanks, we'll see you Saturday.</i>

25:43.009 --> 25:44.308
Okay.

25:59.759 --> 26:01.292
<i>I put the soup in the fridge.</i>

26:01.394 --> 26:02.459
<i>Make sure you have some.</i>

26:02.562 --> 26:03.894
<i>I'm not really hungry.</i>

26:03.996 --> 26:05.863
<i>Force yourself,
you'll feel better.</i>

26:10.670 --> 26:13.938
Hey, you okay?

26:14.040 --> 26:15.105
Meh.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.308
Yeah, you know what?
I'm going to cancel.

26:17.410 --> 26:19.109
No, mom!

26:19.211 --> 26:21.946
No please go, have fun.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.948
Oh, he is texting me.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.683
All right, will you
go to bed early?

26:25.785 --> 26:27.851
- You promise?
- Promise.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.320
Okay.

26:29.422 --> 26:30.588
I love you.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.089
<i>Bye!</i>

27:14.433 --> 27:18.068
So Emily comes to me, she
was about five years old,

27:18.170 --> 27:21.205
and wanted a very serious talk
with me about her relationship

27:21.307 --> 27:24.341
with Mr. Bunny, her stuffed
rabbit and how she feels they

27:24.443 --> 27:26.977
should get married.

27:27.079 --> 27:29.413
I just told her that I
think it's a little soon

27:29.515 --> 27:31.482
and she should wait
until she's older,

27:31.584 --> 27:34.551
and she actually agreed with me.

27:34.654 --> 27:38.555
Then she went behind my back
and married Mr. Bunny anyway.

27:40.593 --> 27:41.859
She has a mind of her own.

27:41.961 --> 27:44.728
Yes, I don't know where
she got that from.

27:46.336 --> 27:47.576
You wanna see a picture of her?

27:47.600 --> 27:48.600
Yeah.

27:49.769 --> 27:53.537
She looks just like you.
I bet she's smart.

27:53.639 --> 27:55.839
She's really smart.

27:55.941 --> 27:58.261
She's having a little trouble
right now with her chem grade

27:58.363 --> 28:00.123
and I'm worried it's
gonna affect her ability

28:00.165 --> 28:02.046
to get into the
college she likes.

28:02.148 --> 28:04.548
Well you know I don't have kids,

28:04.650 --> 28:06.116
but I do hang out
with my brother

28:06.218 --> 28:07.885
and sister's families a lot.

28:07.987 --> 28:11.121
At some point you just
have to let 'em loose,

28:11.223 --> 28:13.557
let 'em go do what
they gotta do,

28:13.659 --> 28:17.428
but don't worry because
they never stray too far,

28:17.530 --> 28:20.464
and they always come back.

28:20.566 --> 28:22.833
Cheers to that.

28:22.935 --> 28:24.435
Cheers.

29:07.724 --> 29:08.724
This was fun.

29:08.748 --> 29:10.013
Yes.

29:11.150 --> 29:13.016
If we get to do this
again, can we do something

29:13.119 --> 29:16.019
maybe a little more formal,
like possibly eating?

29:16.122 --> 29:18.388
I would love that.

29:18.491 --> 29:21.525
This weekend?

29:21.627 --> 29:22.359
Or is that too soon?

29:22.461 --> 29:24.828
It's perfect.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.330
Yeah.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.165
That's our best session yet.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.234
You say that after
every practice.

29:30.336 --> 29:31.535
Because it's true!

29:31.637 --> 29:33.237
We're getting better and better.

29:33.339 --> 29:35.272
We're gonna nail this
showcase, get signed,

29:35.374 --> 29:38.208
tour the country and
then the world!

29:38.310 --> 29:40.644
And you're gonna be a star.

29:48.521 --> 29:51.855
Hey, I was thinking about
grabbing some Johnny's.

29:51.957 --> 29:52.856
Rain check.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.591
I'm already pushing it as it is.

29:54.693 --> 29:57.294
My mom's gonna kill me if
I'm not back before her.

30:08.841 --> 30:12.810
Oh my god, are you kidding me?

30:52.184 --> 30:54.084
I don't know what to say.

30:54.186 --> 30:55.853
Don't say anything.

30:58.691 --> 31:00.490
I just need a minute.

31:15.975 --> 31:17.841
Hey.

31:17.943 --> 31:21.478
Mom, I am so sorry, I
should never have...

31:21.580 --> 31:23.380
Listen.

31:23.482 --> 31:26.049
You lied to me.

31:27.086 --> 31:29.186
Here we are, right?

31:30.589 --> 31:33.357
You know, it took everything
in me to not ground you

31:33.459 --> 31:36.026
until graduation or take
something precious away

31:36.128 --> 31:38.568
from you like your guitar, but
then I realized that the reason

31:38.592 --> 31:40.731
why I want to do that,
is because I feel like

31:40.833 --> 31:43.333
you've taken something
precious away from me tonight.

31:43.435 --> 31:45.369
And this is just not
about me anymore,

31:45.471 --> 31:46.870
this is about you.

31:46.972 --> 31:49.106
Obviously you have to
graduate from high school,

31:49.208 --> 31:54.211
but you're free to do with your
free time what you see fit.

31:54.313 --> 31:58.415
The band, studying.

31:58.517 --> 32:02.686
Because I need to know that
you're not lying to me.

32:02.788 --> 32:06.256
So don't lie to me, okay?

32:06.358 --> 32:10.360
From this point forward, your
grades are your responsibility.

32:10.462 --> 32:12.829
It's all on you now.

32:41.627 --> 32:47.264
So, I'm going to keep
practicing with the band.

32:47.326 --> 32:49.006
Okay, well if that's
what you've decided...

32:49.030 --> 32:54.104
And I'd also like to keep
doing the tutoring sessions.

32:54.206 --> 32:56.873
Because I think they're
really helping.

32:59.878 --> 33:01.478
Okay.

33:01.580 --> 33:02.746
Good night.

33:02.848 --> 33:04.348
Good night.

33:15.594 --> 33:16.927
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:17.029 --> 33:18.395
Glad to see you're up and about.

33:18.497 --> 33:19.730
Oh, that.

33:19.832 --> 33:21.965
Yeah, I completely made that up.

33:22.067 --> 33:23.067
You did?

33:23.168 --> 33:25.936
Yeah, I went to band
practice instead.

33:26.038 --> 33:28.605
Should you be talking
about it so openly?

33:28.707 --> 33:30.407
Oh yeah, she knows.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.309
Totally got busted.

33:32.411 --> 33:33.944
How much trouble did you get in?

33:34.046 --> 33:35.479
Not any, really.

33:35.581 --> 33:36.780
Really?

33:36.882 --> 33:38.648
My parents would have killed me,

33:38.751 --> 33:42.652
and then banned me from ever
playing in that band again.

33:42.755 --> 33:45.088
Yeah, you'd think so.

33:45.190 --> 33:47.657
She hated that I lied to
her, but she knows that

33:47.760 --> 33:50.460
I'm an adult and I should
be making my own decisions.

33:50.562 --> 33:52.896
How progressive of her.

33:52.998 --> 33:56.833
My students' parents would not
have been as open-minded.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.447
I need an iced tea.

34:11.550 --> 34:16.286
Yeah you're right, this is
a good time for a break.

34:26.799 --> 34:30.367
Oh my god, you're a Vertigo fan?

34:30.469 --> 34:33.904
No, I've just seen him
live, like twenty times.

34:34.005 --> 34:37.107
So what's your favorite tune?

34:37.208 --> 34:41.545
Tune you know, song, Vertigo...

34:41.647 --> 34:43.413
Who has Vertigo?

34:43.514 --> 34:44.981
No, it's valence.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.384
Valence is a combination
of elements when they form

34:47.485 --> 34:51.021
chemical molecules combining
to make chemical compounds.

34:51.123 --> 34:52.522
Very nice.

34:52.623 --> 34:57.527
So Emily tells me you
have a big date tonight.

34:57.629 --> 35:01.665
No, I do not.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.267
We're taking things
slow and easy.

35:04.369 --> 35:05.836
Anyway, so...

35:05.938 --> 35:07.838
I might not be here
when you get back.

35:07.940 --> 35:09.339
Oh, okay. Where are you going?

35:09.441 --> 35:10.774
Just to Johnny's with Steve.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.042
Just the two of you?

35:12.144 --> 35:13.043
Yep.

35:13.145 --> 35:14.465
Okay, well don't
be home too late.

35:14.489 --> 35:16.379
I won't if you won't!

35:16.482 --> 35:18.448
I'll take that deal.

35:53.418 --> 35:55.819
So funny because my
first instinct was to

35:55.921 --> 35:59.222
lock her in a box and throw
away the key, as they say.

35:59.324 --> 36:02.559
But then I realized it was
your fault that I didn't.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.060
Why my fault?

36:04.163 --> 36:07.264
I actually couldn't get our
conversation out of my head,

36:07.366 --> 36:09.699
and you were right.

36:09.801 --> 36:12.068
I just need to start
trusting her.

36:12.171 --> 36:14.037
She's gonna do what
she wants anyway,

36:14.139 --> 36:15.839
and I really want her
to be accountable

36:15.941 --> 36:19.309
for her own actions.

36:19.411 --> 36:22.646
You're right, I do deserve
a lot of the credit.

36:42.067 --> 36:43.300
Hey, welcome to Johnny's.

36:43.402 --> 36:44.301
Just one?

36:44.403 --> 36:45.535
Yeah, just one.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.357
And do you know where
the men's restroom is?

36:47.381 --> 36:49.439
Yeah, it's in the back
and to the right.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.707
Great, okay thanks.

37:00.485 --> 37:01.952
Hey, welcome to Johnny's.

37:02.054 --> 37:02.919
Two?

37:03.021 --> 37:05.255
Yeah, just the two of us.

37:05.357 --> 37:06.637
Oh my god, look at that picture!

37:06.725 --> 37:08.358
This way.

37:10.862 --> 37:13.129
Oh my gosh, it looks so good!

37:13.232 --> 37:15.065
What're you gonna get tonight?

37:15.167 --> 37:17.234
I usually just get
pepperoni, honestly.

37:17.336 --> 37:19.269
What? Boring!

37:19.371 --> 37:20.036
What about you?

37:20.138 --> 37:21.705
Supreme, baby!

37:30.449 --> 37:32.916
I'll take a Sprite and
she'll have an iced tea.

37:33.018 --> 37:34.818
I can order for myself!

37:34.920 --> 37:38.355
I will have an iced tea
with a lime, please.

38:11.089 --> 38:12.969
No, I'm not doing
Emily-something, that's weird!

38:12.993 --> 38:13.993
Why?

38:14.092 --> 38:15.772
Because there are other
people in the band!

38:15.874 --> 38:17.794
Yeah but you're the lead,
you're the lead singer.

38:17.843 --> 38:18.528
Stop.

38:18.630 --> 38:19.796
Thanks man.

38:19.898 --> 38:20.964
Thank you.

38:21.066 --> 38:22.399
Appreciate it.

38:23.235 --> 38:25.075
I think Landon and Tanya
would be okay with it,

38:25.099 --> 38:27.265
I'm certainly okay with it.

38:30.142 --> 38:32.008
Excuse me.

38:32.110 --> 38:33.376
You ready?

38:33.478 --> 38:35.812
I'm ready for a menu.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.480
Sure.

38:40.285 --> 38:41.285
It's gonna be great!

38:41.320 --> 38:42.719
I can't wait.

38:42.821 --> 38:45.989
Let's not let anything
ever come between us.

38:46.091 --> 38:48.591
We're a team, always.

38:52.864 --> 38:54.944
Just imagine that, we'll be
going around the country,

38:54.968 --> 38:56.700
state to state.

38:56.802 --> 38:59.402
We'll see everything.

38:59.504 --> 39:01.638
Are you okay?

39:01.740 --> 39:05.275
God I'm feeling, I'm
feeling really tired...

39:06.812 --> 39:08.345
I'm so sorry.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.347
Let me get a towel or something.

39:10.449 --> 39:11.729
It's okay, don't worry about it.

39:11.817 --> 39:13.016
Excuse me, miss?

39:13.118 --> 39:15.385
I'd like to...

39:15.487 --> 39:16.853
Emily!

39:16.955 --> 39:18.988
Emily, are you okay?

39:20.125 --> 39:22.058
Yes hi, I work at Johnny's.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.194
Yes, the one close to Rossmore.

39:24.296 --> 39:25.962
We have a patron,
she's on the floor.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.031
I think she's sick
or something...

39:28.133 --> 39:29.399
Excuse me, excuse me miss?

39:29.501 --> 39:30.567
What?

39:30.669 --> 39:32.229
I'm not trying to get
anyone in trouble,

39:32.331 --> 39:34.612
but I saw that girl's date, he
put something in her drink.

39:34.636 --> 39:35.638
Oh my god.

39:35.741 --> 39:37.240
A patron's just saying
he saw her date

39:37.342 --> 39:40.110
put something in her drink.

39:40.212 --> 39:44.481
Uh huh, okay, yeah.

40:22.053 --> 40:25.722
Well... isn't this lovely?

40:33.565 --> 40:34.998
Emily, it's gonna be okay.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.500
Mr. Garcon?

40:39.037 --> 40:41.604
Can you tell me what this is?

40:41.706 --> 40:44.274
I don't know, I've never
seen that before.

40:46.144 --> 40:48.445
Turn around, son.
You're under arrest.

40:48.547 --> 40:49.712
What?

40:49.815 --> 40:50.815
That's not mine!

40:50.916 --> 40:52.316
You have the right
to remain silent.

40:52.340 --> 40:52.882
Let go!

40:52.944 --> 40:54.224
Anything you say can and will be

40:54.248 --> 40:56.219
used against you
in a court of law.

40:56.321 --> 40:58.021
Emily, I didn't do this!

40:58.123 --> 40:59.522
You have the right
to an attorney

40:59.624 --> 41:03.126
and to have an attorney
present during questioning.

41:03.228 --> 41:04.260
Emily!

41:10.535 --> 41:12.569
Adios, Steve.

41:17.075 --> 41:18.875
Hello?

41:21.146 --> 41:23.146
Wait, where are you from?

41:25.517 --> 41:27.650
I'll be right there.

41:27.752 --> 41:29.552
I have to go, my daughter's
in the hospital.

41:29.654 --> 41:31.154
What?

41:31.256 --> 41:32.789
I'll drive you.

41:42.100 --> 41:43.466
Hey sweetie.

41:44.803 --> 41:46.236
Mom?

41:46.338 --> 41:48.137
You're okay.

41:49.441 --> 41:54.711
Listen sweetheart, they
think somebody drugged you.

41:54.813 --> 41:55.813
What?

41:55.881 --> 41:58.581
They think it was Steve.

41:58.683 --> 41:59.782
No.

41:59.885 --> 42:01.485
Someone saw Steve put
drugs in your drink

42:01.509 --> 42:03.419
and they found drugs in
Steve's car later on.

42:03.522 --> 42:05.722
Do you know anything about that?

42:05.824 --> 42:07.390
I don't believe that.

42:07.492 --> 42:10.093
I don't either.

42:10.195 --> 42:12.428
It's okay, you don't
worry about it.

42:12.531 --> 42:15.532
They're gonna do some
tests and I'll handle it.

42:15.634 --> 42:17.000
Okay.

42:17.102 --> 42:18.701
You go back to sleep.

42:32.150 --> 42:34.317
<i>Is there any way that
could be a mistake?</i>

42:36.087 --> 42:38.154
Yes, of course.

42:38.256 --> 42:40.657
Of course, yes.

42:40.759 --> 42:43.159
<i>Let us know if you have
any more questions.</i>

42:43.261 --> 42:44.661
Thank you.

42:46.097 --> 42:47.864
Who was that?

42:47.966 --> 42:50.500
Oh, uh...

42:54.139 --> 42:56.139
That was the police.

42:59.711 --> 43:02.078
Your test results came back.

43:02.180 --> 43:04.013
The drug that was
in your system,

43:04.115 --> 43:07.283
sweetie it's basically
a date rape drug.

43:07.385 --> 43:10.420
And it's the same drug
they found in Steve's car.

43:10.522 --> 43:11.955
I can't believe it.

43:12.057 --> 43:15.825
How could he do this to me?

43:15.927 --> 43:19.662
We've been best friends
since fifth grade.

43:19.764 --> 43:22.999
I know it's devastating when
someone betrays you like that,

43:23.101 --> 43:25.501
but you never know what's
going on with people.

43:25.604 --> 43:28.271
Maybe something with his family.

43:28.373 --> 43:30.139
People are...

43:30.241 --> 43:33.042
People are really good at
hiding things, you know?

43:33.144 --> 43:35.945
Yeah, I know that now.

43:36.047 --> 43:37.847
That's for sure.

43:37.949 --> 43:39.682
So much for the band, right?

43:39.784 --> 43:43.119
But who needs it.

43:43.221 --> 43:45.488
I guess there is nothing
left for me to do

43:45.590 --> 43:47.957
but study for that
stupid midterm!

43:48.059 --> 43:49.626
Yay!

43:56.067 --> 43:58.434
[Cell phone ringing]

43:59.738 --> 44:01.170
Hey mom.

44:01.272 --> 44:04.173
Hey sweetheart, I'm
stuck at the office.

44:04.275 --> 44:05.275
Is that a big deal?

44:05.343 --> 44:06.623
Well, I'm just not
gonna get home

44:06.647 --> 44:08.544
until after Devin gets there.

44:08.647 --> 44:09.979
I can handle myself, Mom.

44:10.081 --> 44:11.401
I just didn't know
with everything

44:11.425 --> 44:12.915
that's been going on, you know.

44:13.018 --> 44:14.258
<i>I'll be home as soon as I can.</i>

44:14.352 --> 44:14.884
Okay.

44:14.986 --> 44:15.652
<i>Love you.</i>

44:15.754 --> 44:16.986
Love you.

44:19.457 --> 44:21.357
<i>I don't think I'm gonna
stick with music.</i>

44:21.459 --> 44:22.592
What?

44:22.694 --> 44:24.527
No, you're too talented
and it's your passion,

44:24.629 --> 44:25.895
isn't it?

44:25.997 --> 44:28.531
Steve was always the driving
force of everything.

44:28.633 --> 44:31.567
Okay, well now you'll
be the driving force.

44:31.670 --> 44:34.237
And you'll see that people
will be there for you.

44:34.339 --> 44:35.204
Like who?

44:35.306 --> 44:36.739
Me for one.

44:36.841 --> 44:39.876
Yeah, I have an agent friend.

44:39.978 --> 44:43.780
A music agent, and I've
already told him about you.

44:43.882 --> 44:45.415
You did?

44:45.517 --> 44:47.617
Yes, and he said
he was interested

44:47.719 --> 44:49.152
and he wants to hear something.

44:49.254 --> 44:51.454
The only thing is he
wants a demo reel.

44:51.556 --> 44:52.922
Do you have one?

44:53.024 --> 44:54.123
No.

44:54.225 --> 44:55.958
Okay well, when you
get one together,

44:56.061 --> 44:59.228
just give it to me and
I'll pass it along.

44:59.330 --> 45:01.090
All right, let's get
back to your assignment.

45:01.114 --> 45:02.398
We could do something now.

45:02.500 --> 45:03.500
What?

45:03.535 --> 45:04.634
A demo.

45:04.736 --> 45:07.136
No we can't do something
now, maybe later.

45:07.238 --> 45:08.238
Let's just study for now.

45:08.273 --> 45:09.839
No, now is the
perfect time because

45:09.941 --> 45:11.307
my mom's stuck at the office.

45:11.409 --> 45:13.676
Yeah, but I don't have
anything to record on.

45:13.778 --> 45:15.111
Do you have a phone?

45:15.213 --> 45:17.080
Do you think he would
be okay with that?

45:17.182 --> 45:20.183
I don't know, I'd
have to ask him.

45:20.285 --> 45:22.919
Please?

45:23.021 --> 45:25.455
Please?

45:25.557 --> 45:29.826
Okay, do you have a small
room with good acoustics?

45:29.928 --> 45:31.227
Yeah!

45:37.268 --> 45:41.504
It's pretty quiet in here.

45:41.606 --> 45:44.507
This might work.

45:54.385 --> 45:55.685
You ready?

45:55.787 --> 45:57.453
Just one second.

46:01.426 --> 46:02.925
Okay.

46:20.044 --> 46:28.044
♪ Warm wind and fireflies ♪

46:28.153 --> 46:36.153
♪ Kisses under starry skies ♪

46:36.961 --> 46:44.000
♪ Was it just a dream? ♪

46:44.102 --> 46:51.841
♪ I remember everything ♪

46:51.943 --> 46:58.848
♪ I remember everything. ♪

47:06.491 --> 47:09.192
What'd you think?

47:09.294 --> 47:11.394
That was really
something special.

47:11.496 --> 47:12.496
Really?

47:12.597 --> 47:14.163
Yeah.

47:20.138 --> 47:21.437
Oh crap, my mom!

47:21.539 --> 47:23.873
You cannot be in here, come on!

47:45.263 --> 47:47.730
Hey, you're still here huh?

47:47.832 --> 47:51.734
Yeah we're just finishing up.

47:51.836 --> 47:53.196
I think you're gonna
do really well

47:53.220 --> 47:54.303
on the test tomorrow.

47:54.405 --> 47:56.706
I think you're right.

48:04.415 --> 48:06.249
Oh my god!

48:08.920 --> 48:10.353
Wow.

48:13.391 --> 48:14.857
Yo.

48:14.959 --> 48:16.726
Yo.

48:16.828 --> 48:21.864
So they kicked you
out, like for good?

48:21.966 --> 48:23.366
Yeah.

48:23.468 --> 48:26.669
Put me on some kind of a list.

48:26.771 --> 48:28.371
I can't go near the school,

48:28.473 --> 48:30.539
I can't go near Emily
ever again either.

48:30.642 --> 48:33.876
She's put a restraining
order on me.

48:33.978 --> 48:37.280
You know I didn't
do this, right?

48:37.382 --> 48:38.681
Who do you think did it, then?

48:38.783 --> 48:40.683
I don't know, but
I'm gonna find out.

48:40.785 --> 48:42.985
You should let the police
or your lawyer do that.

48:43.087 --> 48:44.787
The police think I'm a criminal!

48:44.889 --> 48:46.155
My lawyer wants me to plead!

48:46.257 --> 48:48.157
Screw that!

48:48.259 --> 48:50.626
Hey, you wanna hang?

48:50.728 --> 48:52.328
Play something?

48:52.430 --> 48:55.164
Nah man, I can't.

48:55.266 --> 48:57.033
I just came to grab
the rest of my stuff.

48:57.135 --> 49:00.136
You said you believe me.

49:00.238 --> 49:01.437
I do, but...

49:01.539 --> 49:03.205
Just take it and get out!

49:11.416 --> 49:13.056
And don't expect me to
accept your apology

49:13.084 --> 49:15.251
when I find out who did this!

49:58.496 --> 50:01.197
I hope you studied
for this, Emily.

50:11.876 --> 50:13.776
Your mom's in her office.

50:20.151 --> 50:21.617
What?

50:24.022 --> 50:26.655
Oh my god!

50:26.758 --> 50:28.958
That's so great!

50:29.060 --> 50:30.893
I'm so proud of you!

50:30.995 --> 50:33.763
Devin's really working out, huh?

50:33.865 --> 50:37.233
Wow, you really know how
to kill a girl's high.

50:37.335 --> 50:39.135
I worked really hard
for that, you know.

50:39.237 --> 50:41.470
Yes, that's why I said
I'm so proud of you.

50:42.473 --> 50:44.173
Thanks.

50:50.448 --> 50:52.415
This is good.

50:52.517 --> 50:54.383
This is really good.

50:55.586 --> 50:57.653
Now I'm scared you're not
gonna need me anymore.

50:57.755 --> 50:59.021
Nonsense!

50:59.123 --> 51:01.824
Now I want an A on the final.

51:01.926 --> 51:03.292
I'm glad to hear that.

51:03.394 --> 51:05.628
Oh by the way, I have
some good news for you.

51:05.730 --> 51:09.098
I spoke to my agent friend
and he liked what he heard.

51:09.200 --> 51:10.833
Shut up!

51:10.935 --> 51:15.304
The thing is though, he wants
a professional demo reel.

51:15.406 --> 51:17.446
If you want, I can set you
up with the arrangements,

51:17.470 --> 51:18.974
get you the space.

51:19.077 --> 51:20.509
No no, you don't
have to do that.

51:20.611 --> 51:21.944
You've already done so much.

51:22.046 --> 51:26.315
No but it'd be my pleasure
because I believe in you.

51:26.417 --> 51:28.451
There's just one other thing.

51:28.553 --> 51:30.653
I don't do auto-tune.

51:30.755 --> 51:34.356
No, he's looking for a
very specific look.

51:34.459 --> 51:39.462
A more all-American,
classic look.

51:39.564 --> 51:41.397
He still believes in you though.

51:41.499 --> 51:43.339
I thought that my music
would stand on its own.

51:43.434 --> 51:46.402
No and it does, it
does stand on its own.

51:46.504 --> 51:50.873
It's just, you don't want to
give him a reason to say no.

51:50.975 --> 51:53.542
Look just think about it
and if you're into it,

51:53.644 --> 51:55.845
I can pick you up here tomorrow

51:55.947 --> 51:59.115
when you're done with
school and we can go.

51:59.217 --> 52:01.117
It's our secret.

52:07.125 --> 52:08.824
Our secret.

52:19.670 --> 52:21.470
Kitchen's closed.

52:22.673 --> 52:23.939
What are you doing here?

52:24.041 --> 52:25.207
I didn't do this.

52:25.309 --> 52:27.069
You'd better leave or
I'm calling the police.

52:27.093 --> 52:28.760
No please, please no!

52:29.780 --> 52:32.515
I don't know how this happened.

52:32.617 --> 52:35.384
One minute I'm here on the first
date with my best friend,

52:35.486 --> 52:37.206
and the next thing I
know I'm being arrested

52:37.230 --> 52:38.687
for trying to drug her.

52:38.789 --> 52:41.357
You said you saw me,
but I didn't do it.

52:41.459 --> 52:44.393
I never said I saw you.

52:44.495 --> 52:46.595
You didn't, then how...

52:46.697 --> 52:48.797
After your friend collapsed
when I was on the phone

52:48.900 --> 52:51.233
with 911, a guy
came up and he said

52:51.335 --> 52:53.135
he saw you put something
in her drink.

52:53.237 --> 52:54.537
A guy? What guy?

52:54.639 --> 53:00.576
I don't know, a guy.
Attractive, tall, blonde hair.

53:00.678 --> 53:02.244
The police were looking for him,

53:02.346 --> 53:04.046
but I guess he left.

54:07.411 --> 54:09.912
So... what do you think?

54:15.253 --> 54:17.653
It's perfect.

54:17.755 --> 54:20.456
Do you like it?

54:20.558 --> 54:24.426
I didn't think I
would, but I do.

54:24.528 --> 54:26.362
You look terrific.

54:46.550 --> 54:48.150
Who's this?

54:48.252 --> 54:49.385
Stop it.

54:49.487 --> 54:50.953
I love it.

54:51.055 --> 54:52.154
It's very professional.

54:52.256 --> 54:53.689
Thank you.

54:53.791 --> 54:57.760
I thought it was
time for a change.

55:00.464 --> 55:02.131
Interesting.

55:20.318 --> 55:21.684
Whoa, what're you doing here?

55:21.786 --> 55:23.266
You were at the
restaurant that night.

55:23.290 --> 55:26.188
You drugged Emily and planted
that stuff in my car.

55:26.290 --> 55:27.290
You're insane.

55:27.325 --> 55:28.390
Really?

55:28.492 --> 55:30.092
I think you're totally
obsessed with her.

55:30.116 --> 55:31.694
That's ridiculous.

55:31.796 --> 55:34.496
Look I already told you,
I'm her tutor, okay?

55:34.598 --> 55:37.232
Were you tutoring her
at the mall today?

55:39.437 --> 55:41.036
You followed us?

55:41.138 --> 55:42.698
Maybe I should just tell Mrs.
Armstrong.

55:42.722 --> 55:44.073
Maybe I should report you

55:44.175 --> 55:45.575
for breaking your
restraining order.

55:45.609 --> 55:47.276
You know, stalking Emily...

55:47.378 --> 55:49.678
I'm on to you and I'm going
to find a way to bust you.

55:49.780 --> 55:51.013
Oh yeah?

55:51.115 --> 55:52.915
Get lost.

55:53.017 --> 55:54.983
Don't count on it.

57:06.524 --> 57:08.257
What are you doing back here?

57:08.359 --> 57:09.758
Wait, let me guess.

57:09.860 --> 57:11.326
Organizing equipment?

57:11.429 --> 57:13.162
Inventorying glassware?

57:13.264 --> 57:14.530
No, I just was...

57:14.632 --> 57:16.498
Helping yourself, I'm sure.

57:16.600 --> 57:17.880
I have a whole list of chemicals

57:17.935 --> 57:19.935
that have gone missing
during your shifts.

57:20.037 --> 57:21.703
Yeah, but that wasn't
because of me.

57:21.806 --> 57:22.905
Really?

57:25.309 --> 57:27.509
What is this?

57:27.611 --> 57:30.045
I was just using that
at my workstation.

57:30.147 --> 57:30.846
No you weren't.

57:30.948 --> 57:32.014
I'm calling security.

57:32.116 --> 57:34.183
Ned...

57:35.286 --> 57:37.853
I wouldn't do that do
that if I were you.

57:37.955 --> 57:39.054
And why not?

57:39.156 --> 57:41.323
Because you couldn't
afford the scandal.

57:41.425 --> 57:44.293
All those chemicals
missing under your watch?

57:44.395 --> 57:47.896
And you didn't record
any of it, now did you?

57:47.998 --> 57:49.531
Yeah that's not gonna
look very good

57:49.633 --> 57:51.366
on your performance
report, now will it?

57:51.469 --> 57:53.402
You're just trying to
cover your little butt,

57:53.504 --> 57:55.070
aren't you?

57:55.172 --> 57:56.872
I want you out of here now.

57:56.974 --> 57:58.507
That's great, Nedster.

57:58.609 --> 58:00.242
Want to know why?

58:00.344 --> 58:02.511
Because I was thinking
of quitting anyway.

58:02.613 --> 58:06.315
Go, before I change my
mind and call the police.

59:41.078 --> 59:42.945
Mom?

59:43.047 --> 59:44.846
What is it?

59:46.417 --> 59:49.818
It's Steve...

59:49.920 --> 59:51.253
he killed himself...

59:51.355 --> 59:53.555
What?

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.834
Hey sweetheart.

01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:09.338
Can I get you anything?

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.073
You should try to
get up and eat,

01:00:11.175 --> 01:00:13.075
are you thirsty?

01:00:16.023 --> 01:00:17.023
Oh sweetie...

01:00:17.047 --> 01:00:19.615
[Door knocking]

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:26.388
Hey there...

01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:29.157
I'm so sorry, I forgot
to call you and cancel.

01:00:29.259 --> 01:00:31.293
I'm sorry, is everything okay?

01:00:31.395 --> 01:00:33.662
You remember the boy, Steve?

01:00:33.764 --> 01:00:36.198
He took his own life.

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:37.699
Oh I'm sorry, that's awful.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:39.167
How's Emily?

01:00:39.269 --> 01:00:40.569
She's not doing so great.

01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:42.170
Please send my condolences.

01:00:42.272 --> 01:00:44.573
Hey.

01:00:44.675 --> 01:00:45.675
Oh, hey.

01:00:45.776 --> 01:00:47.075
I'm sorry, I heard about Steve.

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:48.577
Yeah.

01:00:48.679 --> 01:00:50.839
Listen, I completely understand
if you need your space,

01:00:50.863 --> 01:00:53.315
I'll just check
back later, okay?

01:00:53.417 --> 01:00:55.684
Why don't you stay for dinner?

01:00:55.786 --> 01:00:58.487
Just as a thank you for
everything that he's done.

01:00:58.589 --> 01:01:01.056
He might already have plans.

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:02.791
Do you have plans?

01:01:02.893 --> 01:01:06.995
I mean I wouldn't
want to impose.

01:01:07.097 --> 01:01:08.597
Okay.

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:20.275
This is nice.

01:01:20.377 --> 01:01:21.877
And the food is really good.

01:01:21.979 --> 01:01:23.111
Thank you.

01:01:23.213 --> 01:01:25.080
Thank you.

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:29.751
You know, I should have you two
over to my place sometime.

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:32.020
I make a mean cup
of instant ramen.

01:01:37.361 --> 01:01:39.061
I'm gonna get more
sauce, you want some?

01:01:39.163 --> 01:01:40.163
I can get it.

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:42.264
Oh no, I'll get it.

01:01:44.168 --> 01:01:45.168
Hey...

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:48.170
Studio tomorrow, 3:30.

01:01:48.272 --> 01:01:50.272
Okay.

01:01:59.383 --> 01:02:07.022
♪ Don't let it fade away ♪

01:02:07.124 --> 01:02:15.124

That was incredible.

01:03:05.783 --> 01:03:11.720
It's just weird because Steve
and I wrote that song together.

01:03:11.822 --> 01:03:13.388
You're lucky to have
music to get you

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:16.925
through a loss like that.

01:03:17.027 --> 01:03:19.761
I feel pretty lucky to have you.

01:03:26.003 --> 01:03:28.637
This place is so nice.

01:03:28.739 --> 01:03:30.739
It is, isn't it?

01:03:30.841 --> 01:03:33.975
And by nice, I mean expensive.

01:03:34.077 --> 01:03:35.811
Well you have to get used to it,

01:03:35.913 --> 01:03:39.481
because it's just the beginning.

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:42.984
I feel like this is
just a big dream.

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:18.420
<i>This is my favorite
spot in the valley.</i>

01:04:18.522 --> 01:04:21.256
You know, it reminds me of
this spot that I know of.

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:23.959
It also has an amazing view.

01:04:25.996 --> 01:04:27.729
I want to see it.

01:04:27.831 --> 01:04:29.464
You will.

01:04:50.254 --> 01:04:53.388
I had an amazing night tonight.

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:56.291
I had an amazing
night tonight, too.

01:04:57.304 --> 01:04:58.304
Oh, crap!

01:04:58.328 --> 01:04:58.994
What?

01:04:59.096 --> 01:05:00.562
My mom is home, pull over!

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:08.404
Get in the house!

01:05:08.438 --> 01:05:09.337
Mom!

01:05:09.439 --> 01:05:10.519
Get in the house right now!

01:05:10.574 --> 01:05:11.940
Please, I can explain.

01:05:12.042 --> 01:05:13.308
No, you can't explain anything!

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:15.510
I hired you to be her tutor,
not to do whatever it is

01:05:15.612 --> 01:05:16.945
that's going on here.

01:05:17.047 --> 01:05:18.567
Nothing has happened!
Nothing happened.

01:05:18.591 --> 01:05:20.482
Don't ever step on
my property again.

01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:21.584
Do you understand me?

01:05:21.685 --> 01:05:22.317
Mom!

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:23.785
Get off my property.

01:05:23.887 --> 01:05:24.786
Mom!

01:05:24.888 --> 01:05:25.754
Please!

01:05:25.856 --> 01:05:27.322
Right now!

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:33.628
Can you just tell me how
long has this been going on?

01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:34.963
None of your business.

01:05:35.065 --> 01:05:36.665
Oh, this is none of my business?

01:05:36.767 --> 01:05:38.887
So how long did you plan on
doing this behind my back,

01:05:38.911 --> 01:05:40.001
for the entire school year?

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:41.536
I didn't think you
could handle it.

01:05:41.638 --> 01:05:43.939
I can handle Devin and his
lack of professional conduct,

01:05:44.041 --> 01:05:46.474
what I cannot handle is you
thinking that it's somehow okay

01:05:46.576 --> 01:05:49.678
to date a, what is he, 26?

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:51.479
27 year old?

01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:53.148
I'm 18, Mom.

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:54.930
And you're the one who
said that I could do

01:05:55.018 --> 01:05:57.585
whatever I want, remember?

01:06:30.654 --> 01:06:31.920
What're you doing here?

01:06:32.022 --> 01:06:33.221
I've come to rescue you!

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:35.557
I'm not going to let your
mom stand in our way.

01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:37.025
Come with me to Los Angeles.

01:06:37.127 --> 01:06:38.593
I'll set you up with the agent,

01:06:38.695 --> 01:06:42.230
I'll set you up with
everything, just trust me.

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:45.200
I can't just leave without
telling my mom...

01:06:45.302 --> 01:06:48.870
We'll call her when we
get there, I promise.

01:06:48.972 --> 01:06:50.805
Okay.

01:06:50.907 --> 01:06:52.774
Just give me a minute...

01:07:05.155 --> 01:07:06.321
Hi!

01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:10.392
You ready for this?

01:07:10.494 --> 01:07:11.693
I am.

01:07:29.346 --> 01:07:30.879
Em?

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:34.816
Em, I made breakfast.

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:40.655
Emily?

01:07:51.845 --> 01:07:52.845
Hi.

01:07:52.869 --> 01:07:54.469
Hey.

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:56.237
What's this?

01:07:56.339 --> 01:07:58.339
A little gift.

01:08:01.545 --> 01:08:03.011
You've already given me so much.

01:08:03.113 --> 01:08:05.680
I know, but you deserve it.

01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:07.282
Okay.

01:08:12.289 --> 01:08:14.322
Shoes?

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:15.824
Hiking shoes.

01:08:15.926 --> 01:08:18.960
What I was thinking was, that
we drive up to LA today.

01:08:19.062 --> 01:08:20.328
And then on the way up,

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:23.064
we stop at that spot I
was telling you about.

01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:24.566
Mmm-hmmm?

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:26.388
And then we can spend
the night and that way

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:31.305
you're fresh and ready to go
for agent meeting tomorrow.

01:08:31.408 --> 01:08:34.809
Okay, but I'm not
much of a hiker.

01:08:34.911 --> 01:08:39.680
That's okay, it's easy.
Anyone can do it.

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:42.250
Sure. It sounds fun.

01:08:42.352 --> 01:08:44.551
Good, try it on.

01:08:45.856 --> 01:08:47.154
Right now?

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:48.389
Yeah.

01:08:51.194 --> 01:08:53.461
Okay.

01:08:53.563 --> 01:08:55.263
Just for you.

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:14.415
Come in.

01:09:14.518 --> 01:09:15.928
We need to think of
something else to do

01:09:15.952 --> 01:09:17.417
because I keep calling
over and over

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.532
and no one's answering their
phones, neither one of them.

01:09:19.555 --> 01:09:20.721
Did you call the police?

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:22.201
Of course I called the
police, they say that

01:09:22.225 --> 01:09:24.002
she's not considered a missing
person because she's 18

01:09:24.027 --> 01:09:25.727
they think she's off
with some boyfriend.

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:27.549
Besides being her tutor,
he has a job right?

01:09:27.573 --> 01:09:29.029
Yes, he works at a lab...

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:30.812
Let's call the company,
maybe someone there

01:09:30.836 --> 01:09:31.866
can reach out to him.

01:09:31.968 --> 01:09:33.935
I remember him in a t-shirt.

01:09:34.037 --> 01:09:36.203
One day.

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:38.872
What did it say, Mulberry Labs?

01:09:38.975 --> 01:09:40.542
Mul...

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:43.745
There's a Mulford Labs.

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.246
Mulford, give me that number!

01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:46.881
That could be it.

01:10:06.269 --> 01:10:07.735
Hello, Ned speaking.

01:10:07.837 --> 01:10:09.437
Hello yes, Devin Fletch.

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:11.306
Can you tell me if Devin
Fletch is in today?

01:10:11.408 --> 01:10:12.840
Devin?

01:10:12.943 --> 01:10:14.976
He's no longer
employed by Mulford.

01:10:16.947 --> 01:10:18.112
You look great.

01:10:18.215 --> 01:10:19.575
The only thing
though, is the hair.

01:10:19.599 --> 01:10:20.281
What about it?

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:23.151
We just need to put it up.

01:10:23.253 --> 01:10:25.053
Can you tell me when he
stopped working there?

01:10:25.077 --> 01:10:26.321
Last week.

01:10:26.423 --> 01:10:28.823
I can't give you the details,
work privacy laws and so forth,

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:32.894
but between you and me, our
inventories were a little bit

01:10:32.996 --> 01:10:37.198
light after his shift,
it you know what I mean.

01:10:38.435 --> 01:10:40.001
Let me see you.

01:10:40.103 --> 01:10:42.303
God.

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:44.672
I love you.

01:10:44.774 --> 01:10:48.176
If you'd like my honest,
off the record opinion,

01:10:48.278 --> 01:10:50.545
I would not trust him as
far as I could throw him.

01:10:50.647 --> 01:10:53.781
He's a pathological
liar and a thief.

01:10:53.883 --> 01:10:56.517
Stay away from him.

01:11:02.392 --> 01:11:04.425
I'll be ready to go
in just a minute.

01:11:09.633 --> 01:11:11.132
We have to find her right now.

01:11:11.234 --> 01:11:12.000
Where does he live?

01:11:12.102 --> 01:11:13.735
Oh my gosh!

01:11:13.837 --> 01:11:14.837
Where does he live?

01:11:14.904 --> 01:11:16.671
I have his address in my files.

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:17.872
Let's go!

01:11:41.231 --> 01:11:43.097
I don't see anyone.

01:12:04.154 --> 01:12:05.420
Kelly, it's open!

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:08.756
I'm not gonna fit,
you're gonna have to go.

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:09.957
Okay.

01:12:12.796 --> 01:12:14.095
Get the door!

01:12:35.118 --> 01:12:37.685
Kelly!

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:40.421
He's stockpiling for something.

01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:42.323
What is that?

01:12:44.627 --> 01:12:46.961
She looks like Emily.

01:12:47.063 --> 01:12:48.383
I'm going to look
at the computer,

01:12:48.407 --> 01:12:49.764
see if I can find anything.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:52.600
It says she died at
Rancho Vista State Park.

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:53.835
I've been there.

01:12:53.937 --> 01:12:55.603
There's a ton of trails.

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:56.971
Rancho Vista, cliffs...

01:12:57.073 --> 01:12:58.773
It looks like he printed
out a parking pass

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:01.576
for Rancho Vista State
Park for today.

01:13:01.678 --> 01:13:03.010
Oh my god.

01:13:16.059 --> 01:13:17.459
<i>This is Emily, leave
me a message.</i>

01:13:17.483 --> 01:13:18.993
Voicemail.

01:13:19.095 --> 01:13:20.628
Emily, please call me.

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.163
I need to know you're okay.

01:13:24.534 --> 01:13:26.267
It's beautiful, isn't it?

01:13:26.369 --> 01:13:27.735
Yeah.

01:13:27.837 --> 01:13:29.570
I knew you'd love it.

01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:31.550
<i>Anything?</i>

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:32.574
No.

01:13:38.548 --> 01:13:40.348
How much further to this view?

01:13:40.450 --> 01:13:43.084
It's just up the hill. Careful.

01:13:43.186 --> 01:13:45.153
That is so many more steps!

01:13:45.255 --> 01:13:47.422
Hey, you wanna stop?

01:13:47.524 --> 01:13:49.357
I am tired.

01:13:49.459 --> 01:13:51.959
There's like tons of
blisters on my feet.

01:13:52.061 --> 01:13:53.995
This doesn't sound like you.

01:13:54.097 --> 01:13:56.164
I told you I'm not
the outdoorsy type.

01:13:56.266 --> 01:13:57.432
Yeah but we're human.

01:13:57.534 --> 01:13:59.000
We all need Vitamin D.

01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:00.768
I'll take a supplement.

01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:02.437
After everything
I've done for you,

01:14:02.539 --> 01:14:05.206
do you not trust that this
view will be worth it?

01:14:08.278 --> 01:14:10.945
Ugh, come on.

01:14:15.919 --> 01:14:16.951
Come on.

01:14:17.053 --> 01:14:18.853
It's right up this way.

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:22.023
Just give me a minute.

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:24.158
It's exactly like it was before.

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:25.626
Before?

01:14:25.728 --> 01:14:26.928
What does that mean?

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:29.363
It doesn't matter.

01:14:39.876 --> 01:14:41.709
What did I tell you?

01:14:45.482 --> 01:14:47.381
It's nice.

01:14:48.785 --> 01:14:53.688
But you know, I have
seen the ocean before.

01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:55.423
Hey hey, what are you doing?

01:14:55.525 --> 01:14:57.765
No, that's supposed to be up,
that's supposed to stay up.

01:14:57.789 --> 01:14:59.093
Stop! Don't do that.

01:14:59.195 --> 01:15:00.828
No, but this is not right.

01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:04.999
Okay stop, you're kind
of freaking me out,

01:15:05.101 --> 01:15:07.034
so I'm gonna head back.

01:15:07.136 --> 01:15:08.436
No, come here.

01:15:08.538 --> 01:15:09.698
Not yet, you can't leave yet.

01:15:09.772 --> 01:15:12.206
Let go of me, Devin!

01:15:12.308 --> 01:15:15.109
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:15:15.211 --> 01:15:18.546
I'm just being a perfectionist,

01:15:18.648 --> 01:15:22.450
really I just want
everything to be so perfect.

01:15:22.552 --> 01:15:24.719
You want what to be perfect?

01:15:24.821 --> 01:15:27.555
Emily, when I first saw you,

01:15:27.657 --> 01:15:30.525
I knew there was something
special about you.

01:15:30.627 --> 01:15:31.926
Devin...

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:34.362
Emily...

01:15:34.464 --> 01:15:36.330
will you marry me?

01:15:37.934 --> 01:15:42.970
Wow Devin, I had no idea that
this was where this was going.

01:15:43.072 --> 01:15:44.438
Well of course.

01:15:44.541 --> 01:15:47.074
I love you and I
know you love me.

01:15:47.176 --> 01:15:48.776
Yeah, I do.

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:51.579
In a way...

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:53.281
What does that mean?

01:15:53.383 --> 01:15:57.084
Look, this is all
happening way too fast.

01:15:57.186 --> 01:15:59.820
Well it's happening fast
because it's meant to be.

01:15:59.923 --> 01:16:01.589
But marriage?

01:16:01.691 --> 01:16:03.824
I don't know if I ever
want to get married.

01:16:03.927 --> 01:16:05.626
You're young.

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:07.161
Everyone young feels that way.

01:16:07.263 --> 01:16:08.663
That's the only reason.

01:16:08.765 --> 01:16:13.501
Maybe so, but all I know is
that's how I feel right now.

01:16:13.603 --> 01:16:15.503
No.

01:16:15.605 --> 01:16:17.438
No, you can't say no to me.

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:18.739
I'm sorry.

01:16:18.841 --> 01:16:20.975
You can't do this to me again.

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:22.710
Again?

01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:35.289
If they're where I
think they are,

01:16:35.391 --> 01:16:36.257
I know a short cut.

01:16:36.359 --> 01:16:37.359
Okay.

01:16:37.794 --> 01:16:39.260
You don't understand
everything that

01:16:39.362 --> 01:16:40.628
I've done for you.

01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:42.496
I appreciate it Devin, I do.

01:16:42.599 --> 01:16:44.298
Everything I've
done for your dream

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:45.967
and this is what you do to mine?

01:16:46.069 --> 01:16:48.703
This is what you do to
mine, you've destroyed it!

01:16:48.805 --> 01:16:51.272
No, don't you ignore me!

01:16:52.575 --> 01:16:54.842
Come here, no!

01:16:57.981 --> 01:17:00.781
Shhh, see?

01:17:00.883 --> 01:17:03.250
See, this is nice.

01:17:09.258 --> 01:17:11.392
Go! Go!

01:17:16.065 --> 01:17:19.700
It's just me and you.
It's just us baby!

01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:22.403
This is the way it should be.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:27.808
See? You don't
need this anymore.

01:17:31.881 --> 01:17:33.114
Come here.

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:41.822
Get away from her!

01:17:41.924 --> 01:17:43.057
Hey! Who are you?

01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:44.225
Shut the hell up!

01:17:44.327 --> 01:17:46.494
Emily, I'm Jared
your mom's friend.

01:17:46.596 --> 01:17:48.663
She's coming down the trail
right now, come with me.

01:17:48.735 --> 01:17:49.975
This is not what it looks like.

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:52.366
Shut up! Emily, come with me.

01:17:52.468 --> 01:17:54.702
Okay, go right ahead.

01:17:54.804 --> 01:17:56.084
This is a total
misunderstanding.

01:18:02.478 --> 01:18:05.179
Stay away from me!

01:18:06.582 --> 01:18:10.951
Oh my god, Devin,
please help me!

01:18:11.054 --> 01:18:12.286
Help me, please!

01:18:12.388 --> 01:18:13.521
You don't want my help.

01:18:13.623 --> 01:18:15.122
You never did.

01:18:15.224 --> 01:18:19.193
No, I do! Anything
that you want, please!

01:18:19.295 --> 01:18:20.394
Tell me you love me!

01:18:20.496 --> 01:18:25.700
I love you! Please!

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.475
Devin!

01:18:34.577 --> 01:18:36.577
Devin...

01:18:36.679 --> 01:18:39.313
Emily's coming with me,
we're going to be a family.

01:18:39.415 --> 01:18:40.915
There's nothing you
can do about it.

01:18:41.017 --> 01:18:43.751
Devin please dont' hurt her,
she means everything to me.

01:18:43.853 --> 01:18:46.587
She means everything to me!

01:18:46.689 --> 01:18:49.223
She's not Alexis.

01:18:49.325 --> 01:18:51.792
I'm so sorry for everything
you went through.

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:56.297
It must have been so hard
for you to lose her.

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:58.432
Just let Emily go.

01:18:58.534 --> 01:19:00.568
I want to help you.

01:19:00.670 --> 01:19:04.171
You don't want her to do what
you want or what I want.

01:19:04.273 --> 01:19:08.008
If I can't have her...

01:19:08.111 --> 01:19:09.910
No one can!

01:19:10.012 --> 01:19:11.579
Devin!

01:19:38.207 --> 01:19:41.675
Come on honey, let's go.

01:19:46.048 --> 01:19:48.249
No!

01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:56.957
Oh my god, where did he go?

01:20:11.707 --> 01:20:14.608
It's okay, we're gonna be okay.

01:20:27.023 --> 01:20:29.557
So do you want to go to
dinner after your showcase?

01:20:29.659 --> 01:20:31.725
Can't, I have a
midterm tomorrow.

01:20:31.828 --> 01:20:34.361
But I'll be home next weekend.

01:20:34.463 --> 01:20:36.297
Cool, we'll do it then.

01:20:36.399 --> 01:20:38.666
Devin? Order up for Devin!

01:21:19.575 --> 01:21:21.942
Sorry, are you okay?

01:21:22.044 --> 01:21:24.712
Yeah I'm just running
late to chemistry.

01:21:24.814 --> 01:21:26.947

Professor Grover?

01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:28.049

01:21:28.084 --> 01:21:29.917

01:21:30.019 --> 01:21:32.086

01:21:32.188 --> 01:21:33.053

terrible at chemistry.

01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:50.804

any help let me know.

01:21:50.907 --> 01:21:52.940
