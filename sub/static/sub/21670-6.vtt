WEBVTT

00:00.517 --> 00:02.796
<i>Previously on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:02.797 --> 00:03.673
Go!

00:03.674 --> 00:05.685
In a challenge that
tested the team's palates...

00:05.686 --> 00:06.922
Pork, chef.
Wrong!

00:06.923 --> 00:08.457
The blue team was baffled.

00:08.458 --> 00:09.825
Kangaroo, chef?
Wrong!

00:09.826 --> 00:11.193
, man.

00:11.194 --> 00:12.294
<i>When was the last time
you had a kangaroo meatball?</i>

00:12.295 --> 00:13.428
While the red team...

00:13.429 --> 00:15.063
Veal, chef!
Is it veal? Yes!

00:15.064 --> 00:16.297
Whoo!
Go, go, go, go, go!

00:16.299 --> 00:17.666
Led by Ja'nel and Jacqueline...

00:17.667 --> 00:18.733
Swordfish! Swordfish!

00:19.735 --> 00:21.069
<i>Yeah! Yes!</i>

00:21.070 --> 00:22.571
Continue their
challenge domination

00:22.572 --> 00:24.773
with their fourth
consecutive win.

00:24.774 --> 00:26.108
If I was on the guys' team
right now,

00:26.109 --> 00:27.742
I'd be begging
for a sex change.

00:27.743 --> 00:30.178
The women were rewarded
with a beach day in Malibu...

00:30.179 --> 00:32.414
O-M-G.

00:32.415 --> 00:33.415
Amazing.

00:33.416 --> 00:34.416
While the men...

00:34.417 --> 00:35.484
This is .

00:35.485 --> 00:36.885
Made homemade bread.

00:36.886 --> 00:38.987
I've never done anything
so hard in my life.

00:40.490 --> 00:42.657
Then,
an early-morning wake-up...

00:42.658 --> 00:44.960
Led to a surprise
breakfast service.

00:44.961 --> 00:46.995
We will be feeding
emergency doctors,

00:46.996 --> 00:49.231
<i>nurses, and EMTs.</i>

00:49.232 --> 00:50.465
In the blue kitchen...

00:50.466 --> 00:52.334
How much longer
on you guys's Benny?

00:52.335 --> 00:55.637
Jeremy was
stuck in slow motion...

00:55.638 --> 00:57.305
<i>Jeremy, walk.</i>

00:57.306 --> 00:59.007
Come 'round then, big boy!

00:59.008 --> 01:00.709
And made a ridiculous mistake.

01:00.710 --> 01:02.310
Some disgusting pig

01:02.311 --> 01:05.247
brought me the sample
scrambled eggs

01:05.248 --> 01:06.982
that I cooked an hour ago!

01:06.983 --> 01:08.550
Like, "Duh..."

01:08.551 --> 01:09.551
On the red side...

01:09.552 --> 01:11.486
Nedra!
Wakey, wakey.

01:11.487 --> 01:12.888
Nedra's eggs Benedict...

01:12.889 --> 01:15.123
Why you used the soggy one?

01:15.124 --> 01:16.725
And Jacqueline's pancakes...

01:16.726 --> 01:18.593
Look at me.
Too dark!

01:18.594 --> 01:20.061
It's a breakfast.
Come on.

01:20.062 --> 01:21.763
Put the women behind.

01:21.764 --> 01:22.831
Walking! Walking!

01:22.832 --> 01:24.232
<i>Behind, behind, behind.
Go, go, go.</i>

01:24.233 --> 01:25.233
And the men...

01:25.234 --> 01:26.401
Congratulations, blue team!

01:26.402 --> 01:27.536
Finally!

01:27.537 --> 01:29.004
Managed to get a victory.

01:29.005 --> 01:30.405
We just lost.

01:30.406 --> 01:31.840
I am so stoked right now.

01:31.841 --> 01:33.508
The women picked
two for elimination...

01:33.509 --> 01:35.810
<i>It has to be Jackie and Nedra.</i>

01:35.811 --> 01:37.145
But Nedra fought back.

01:37.146 --> 01:39.915
I'm the bitch who kept
the station going!

01:39.916 --> 01:41.683
So y'all if y'all
don't wanna save me!

01:41.684 --> 01:43.251
Who's gonna go up
instead of you?

01:43.252 --> 01:45.220
Mary!

01:45.221 --> 01:46.788
She's weak.

01:46.789 --> 01:48.490
In the end, the nominees were...

01:48.491 --> 01:49.491
Jacqueline, chef.

01:49.492 --> 01:50.725
And...
Mary.

01:50.726 --> 01:51.726
But chef Ramsay

01:51.727 --> 01:53.128
had his eye on someone else.

01:53.129 --> 01:54.563
You two, back in line.

01:54.564 --> 01:56.598
Thank you, chef.
Oh, my God.

01:56.599 --> 01:58.667
Find out right now.

01:58.668 --> 02:00.335
There is one of you here

02:00.336 --> 02:03.438
<i>that is in way over their head.</i>

02:03.439 --> 02:05.240
Who will lose their chance

02:05.241 --> 02:07.542
to become head chef
of Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill

02:07.543 --> 02:08.910
at Caesar's palace.

02:08.911 --> 02:12.514
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen is...

02:14.684 --> 02:16.151
* Fire

02:16.152 --> 02:18.186
Whoa...

02:18.187 --> 02:21.256
* The way you swerve
and curve *

02:21.257 --> 02:23.091
* really wrecks my nerves

02:23.092 --> 02:25.393
* and I'm so excited, child

02:25.394 --> 02:26.995
<i>Go, Jon!</i>

02:26.996 --> 02:30.365
* When you shake
what you've got *

02:30.366 --> 02:32.334
* and, girl, you've got a lot *

02:32.335 --> 02:33.802
* you're really somethin',
child *

02:36.639 --> 02:39.708
* When you're hot, you're hot *

02:39.709 --> 02:41.309
* you really shoot your shot

02:41.310 --> 02:43.345
* you're dynamite, child

02:43.346 --> 02:45.146
* yeah

02:45.147 --> 02:48.216
* well, I can tell
by your game *

02:48.217 --> 02:51.019
* you're gonna start a flame

02:51.020 --> 02:53.455
* love, baby, baby

02:53.456 --> 02:57.592

02:57.593 --> 02:59.194

02:59.195 --> 03:00.562
Hey, hey!

03:01.631 --> 03:02.631
* You're gonna get your wish

03:02.632 --> 03:04.566
* oh, no

03:04.567 --> 03:06.268

03:06.269 --> 03:08.303

the continuation of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

03:25.255 --> 03:26.588
<i>Mary, Jacqueline.</i>

03:26.589 --> 03:28.624
You two, back in line.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.627
Thank you, chef.
Oh, my God.

03:32.829 --> 03:34.296
There is one of you here

03:34.297 --> 03:39.001
<i>that is in way
over their heads.</i>

03:39.002 --> 03:41.259
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen is...

03:42.805 --> 03:45.807
Jeremy.

03:47.377 --> 03:48.977
Get your ass up here.

03:50.880 --> 03:54.549
You've done something
that I have never seen, ever.

03:54.550 --> 03:57.552
You brought up a sample plate.

03:57.553 --> 03:59.154
Give me your jacket.

03:59.155 --> 04:02.090
<i>Your time is done
in Hell's Kitchen.</i>

04:02.091 --> 04:03.659
Thank you, chef Ramsay.

04:03.660 --> 04:04.993
Thank you.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.831
Wow.

04:11.034 --> 04:13.302
I don't know
what I was thinking.

04:13.303 --> 04:15.537
It was my fault.
I brought up the wrong plate.

04:15.538 --> 04:17.738
But I've learned
a lot about myself.

04:17.740 --> 04:19.641
I know I'm a fighter.

04:19.642 --> 04:22.244
And above all,
I'm a great chef.

04:22.245 --> 04:24.146
Men, you won today,

04:24.147 --> 04:26.882
<i>in spite of Jeremy,
so your reward</i>

04:26.883 --> 04:28.917
is me getting rid of him.

04:28.918 --> 04:31.086
We're stronger
without him, chef.

04:31.087 --> 04:33.221
Now, both teams,
get your crap together,

04:33.222 --> 04:36.959
because I am going
to start cutting dead weight.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.293
<i>We will be open
for dinner service tonight.</i>

04:38.294 --> 04:39.661
Got it? Yes, chef.

04:39.662 --> 04:41.797
Piss off.

04:41.798 --> 04:43.098
I would never in a million years

04:43.099 --> 04:45.233
think that chef Ramsay
would send home

04:45.234 --> 04:46.668
one of the blue team,
even though it is

04:46.669 --> 04:47.936
kind of a blessing in disguise,

04:47.937 --> 04:50.339
because Jeremy was really
useless to us.

04:50.340 --> 04:51.606
That's... hey, better
for us.

04:51.607 --> 04:53.041
Better for us.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.777
Everything happens
for a reason.

04:55.778 --> 04:58.046
I'm sorry he had to go,
but I'm glad that chef Ramsay

04:58.047 --> 05:00.649
knows that I'm more talented
than Jeremy is.

05:00.650 --> 05:02.918
It is definitely
a chance at redemption.

05:02.919 --> 05:05.053
And tonight,
I'm gonna prove myself.

05:08.992 --> 05:11.760
The overall, you know,
mood, I would say,

05:11.761 --> 05:14.162
of the team right now,
is somber.

05:14.163 --> 05:15.731
Where do you guys wanna go?

05:15.732 --> 05:16.898
<i>Big bedroom.</i>

05:16.899 --> 05:17.966
A lot of words were said.

05:17.967 --> 05:19.368
A lot of anger was had.

05:19.369 --> 05:22.771
I just hope that
the rest of the ladies

05:22.772 --> 05:24.639
swallow their pride
and just move forward.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.074
We just have to execute.

05:26.075 --> 05:28.110
If we can execute,
we'll be fine.

05:28.111 --> 05:29.778
Are you gonna be okay?

05:29.779 --> 05:31.380
<i>What do you need?</i>

05:31.381 --> 05:34.149
Could have been me.
It could have been anybody.

05:34.150 --> 05:36.018
Amanda is the only person
who felt like

05:36.019 --> 05:38.487
I should have went up...
I gotta watch her.

05:38.488 --> 05:39.921
All this cutie-cutie,
buddy-buddy,

05:39.922 --> 05:42.591
girly-girly
is done.

05:42.592 --> 05:43.725
Come here.

05:46.896 --> 05:48.964
<i>I have no hard feelings
against you,</i>

05:48.965 --> 05:50.999
and I want you to know that.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.502
Oh, my God.

05:53.503 --> 05:55.937
I nominated Nedra.

05:55.938 --> 05:57.839
If Nedra holds it against me,

05:57.840 --> 06:00.442
that's gonna be
the downfall of herself

06:00.443 --> 06:02.911
and the team, 'cause we
need her for service.

06:02.912 --> 06:05.147
I just don't want any
hard feelings between us.

06:05.148 --> 06:06.948
No.
Okay?

06:06.949 --> 06:08.417
Come here.

06:08.418 --> 06:10.752
I remain friendly with her

06:10.753 --> 06:11.753
to keep the peace

06:11.754 --> 06:13.989
and the morale of the red team.

06:13.990 --> 06:16.725
I don't want to lose
any of you guys.

06:16.726 --> 06:18.560
I'm not a person
who gives up or folds,

06:18.561 --> 06:20.228
so I'm gonna fight.

06:20.229 --> 06:21.830
We're cool.
We're cool?

06:25.101 --> 06:27.369
After some stressful
time up in the dorm...

06:27.370 --> 06:28.370
Let's go, ladies.

06:28.371 --> 06:29.471
The chefs return

06:29.472 --> 06:31.139
to prep for dinner service,

06:31.140 --> 06:32.741
which is only a few hours away.

06:32.742 --> 06:34.342
<i>Start prepping.
Yes, chef.</i>

06:34.343 --> 06:35.777
But one chef is worried...

06:35.778 --> 06:37.079
Do you feel nauseous?

06:37.080 --> 06:38.647
About being late.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.549
I'm all right.
I just would rather know

06:40.550 --> 06:42.050
<i>if I'm just, like, nauseous</i>

06:42.051 --> 06:44.052
or pregnant and nauseous.

06:44.053 --> 06:45.821
My period's really late.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.889
I've been nauseous
a lot of days in a row,

06:47.890 --> 06:49.458
and so I'm nervous.

06:49.459 --> 06:51.460
I have to pee so bad.

06:51.461 --> 06:53.428
To me, there's no excuses.

06:53.429 --> 06:55.464
You're pregnant or you're not,
it doesn't matter.

06:55.465 --> 06:56.932
If you throw up, you throw up,

06:56.933 --> 06:57.933
you get back on the line.

06:57.934 --> 06:59.301
Mmm!

06:59.302 --> 07:01.536
I can't worry about
another bitch's problems.

07:01.537 --> 07:03.839
I need to worry
about my problems.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.741
But she needs to get that
together, boop!

07:08.678 --> 07:10.479
Really?
Yeah.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.013
Mary's getting
her little testy.

07:16.786 --> 07:18.720
I'll be really excited
if I'm pregnant,

07:18.721 --> 07:20.622
but I'm also...
I mean, I'm nervous.

07:20.623 --> 07:22.824
I don't know what that means
for the competition

07:22.825 --> 07:24.493
if I am.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.034
Definitely not!
Just so you know.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.504
Definitely not.
Like, instantly, it came up.

07:35.505 --> 07:37.305
I just wanna cook.
That's it.

07:37.306 --> 07:39.875
I don't wanna deal
with all this other .

07:39.876 --> 07:41.343
Keep goin'!

07:41.344 --> 07:43.512
With Mary's
big question answered,

07:43.513 --> 07:45.680
the red team refocuses
their attention

07:45.681 --> 07:47.082
on getting ready for dinner.

07:47.083 --> 07:49.251
But in the blue kitchen,
it's Dan...

07:49.252 --> 07:50.318
All right, stupid question.

07:50.319 --> 07:51.520
Frisee, what does that
go with again?

07:51.521 --> 07:53.388
Who's looking for answers.

07:53.389 --> 07:54.623
Asparagus.
Okay.

07:54.624 --> 07:56.825
That's what I thought.
I just wanted to verify.

07:56.826 --> 07:58.226
<i>That's the one
I'm least familiar with.</i>

07:58.227 --> 07:59.794
I got the asparagus.
We got eggs.

07:59.795 --> 08:01.363
Endive feathers?

08:01.364 --> 08:03.098
That's what I'm missing.
Endive feathers.

08:03.099 --> 08:05.767
Once again, I'm really
worried about Dan the most,

08:05.768 --> 08:07.536
going into tonight's service

08:07.537 --> 08:09.871
because I just question
his food knowledge

08:09.872 --> 08:11.006
and his experience.

08:11.007 --> 08:12.007
All right,
I got these dressings

08:12.008 --> 08:13.208
lined up correctly, right?

08:13.209 --> 08:15.410
And these are cut
into quarters or sixths?

08:15.411 --> 08:17.179
All right, what do you
need from me, boss hogg?

08:17.180 --> 08:19.648
Lemon tarts.
Lemon tarts, lemon tarts.

08:19.649 --> 08:20.849
How do we make those?

08:20.850 --> 08:22.350
Dude, are you serious?

08:22.351 --> 08:23.685
Are you a chef or...
what are you?

08:23.686 --> 08:24.719
What are you doing here?

08:24.720 --> 08:25.921
Little pastry cups.

08:25.922 --> 08:26.955
In the pastry cups?

08:26.956 --> 08:28.023
He doesn't know
what he's doing.

08:28.024 --> 08:29.391
It's like, dude, either man up

08:29.392 --> 08:30.525
or get the out.

08:30.526 --> 08:32.059
Do you have the empty ones
down there?

08:32.061 --> 08:34.062
You can't use that.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.933
After a very
early morning wake-up

08:37.933 --> 08:39.267
for breakfast service,

08:39.268 --> 08:42.037
followed by a non-stop prep
for dinner service...

08:42.038 --> 08:43.837
All right, let's get
the hell out of here, come on.

08:43.839 --> 08:45.807
The teams are
given a short break.

08:45.808 --> 08:46.908
Big room.

08:50.112 --> 08:51.646
Flat-out, we got a stronger team
than they do right now.

08:51.647 --> 08:52.647
Even with Ray?

08:52.648 --> 08:54.249
I like us right now.

08:54.250 --> 08:58.520
Hell, yeah.
Just keep it going.

08:58.521 --> 09:00.155
<i>Mary, I like
that fight, baby.</i>

09:00.156 --> 09:01.423
<i>Thank you.</i>

09:01.424 --> 09:02.724
Yeah, girl.
Yeah, for real.

09:02.725 --> 09:03.825
I think it's great.

09:03.826 --> 09:05.694
Earlier today,
the girls put Mary up.

09:05.695 --> 09:07.062
Mary fought back.

09:07.063 --> 09:09.231
I made my mistakes,
but I didn't let it get me down,

09:09.232 --> 09:10.665
and I picked back up, chef.

09:10.666 --> 09:12.400
<i>And Mary, always remember
how they was talking.</i>

09:12.401 --> 09:13.602
<i>No, they love me.</i>

09:13.603 --> 09:15.270
Don't you believe that, Mary.

09:15.271 --> 09:17.339
You know what?
Shut your mouth.

09:17.340 --> 09:18.707
<i>Mary, they threw you
under the bus</i>

09:18.708 --> 09:20.542
<i>faster than anything.
Seriously.</i>

09:20.543 --> 09:22.577
Don't even talk to me
anymore, I'm serious.

09:22.578 --> 09:23.912
<i>Okay.
Aww.</i>

09:23.913 --> 09:25.280
<i>Bye, Mary.</i>

09:25.281 --> 09:26.648
That's her angry voice.

09:28.884 --> 09:30.185
Whoa!

09:30.186 --> 09:31.620
What happened, Mary?

09:31.621 --> 09:33.021
<i>The guys are being jerks,
and they're</i>

09:33.022 --> 09:34.222
talking crap to me.

09:34.223 --> 09:35.557
<i>Shut up!</i>

09:35.558 --> 09:36.591
<i>If you can't win</i>

09:36.592 --> 09:37.626
because you're good,

09:37.627 --> 09:38.793
then don't try to win

09:38.794 --> 09:40.362
by shooting us down,
you know what I mean?

09:40.363 --> 09:41.596
Like, I'm pissed.

09:42.765 --> 09:44.299
They're laughing.

09:44.300 --> 09:46.601
I'm-a just go hammer time
on all of them.

09:46.602 --> 09:49.104
It's a couple people
I want to cross my path.

09:49.105 --> 09:50.438
I can just hammer to 'em.

09:50.439 --> 09:52.073
Oh, .

09:52.074 --> 09:53.608
What up?

09:53.609 --> 09:55.677
Listen, it's okay
to antagonize people

09:55.678 --> 09:56.678
who can handle it.

09:56.679 --> 09:57.712
Don't do that

09:57.713 --> 09:58.980
<i>to people who's weak.</i>

09:58.981 --> 10:00.282
<i>That's up.</i>

10:00.283 --> 10:01.416
So whoever it was,

10:01.417 --> 10:03.118
y'all can kiss
a big , okay?

10:04.420 --> 10:05.754
Competition's getting
heated up.

10:05.755 --> 10:06.988
The red team's
starting to really...

10:06.989 --> 10:08.323
I feel like
they're cracking, man.

10:08.324 --> 10:10.292
So it's fun
to with 'em.

10:10.293 --> 10:11.660
So who was the bitch
who did it?

10:11.661 --> 10:12.694
<i>Who did what?</i>

10:12.695 --> 10:13.928
<i>Antagonizing people.</i>

10:13.929 --> 10:15.630
<i>Ain't nobody
antagonizing nobody.</i>

10:15.631 --> 10:17.399
All right, well don't
say nothin' to her.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.501
Did we say somethin' to y'all
when y'all got up

10:19.502 --> 10:21.102
<i>two nights in a row?
No.</i>

10:21.103 --> 10:22.937
So don't
say to us.

10:22.938 --> 10:24.906
Say something to her
when you can win a challenge.

10:24.907 --> 10:27.042
<i>All right, heard. 'Cause I'll
tell y'all some ,</i>

10:27.043 --> 10:29.044
<i>quick fast, in a hurry.</i>

10:29.045 --> 10:30.879
<i>Ohh. You don't wanna
with me.</i>

10:30.880 --> 10:32.414
I'm Mike Tyson, bitch.

10:33.783 --> 10:35.050
Ring the bell
if you wanna play.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.185
<i>Ring it.
Ring it, bitches, ring it.</i>

10:37.186 --> 10:38.453
Ding-ding.
Ding-ding-ding.

10:38.454 --> 10:39.854
Well, let's go, !

10:39.855 --> 10:41.423
No, no, no, no, no.

10:48.214 --> 10:49.581
The chefs take a quick break

10:49.582 --> 10:51.583
before their second service
of the day.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.051
I like us right now.

10:53.052 --> 10:54.819
But after
the men tease Mary...

10:54.820 --> 10:57.122
Don't even talk to me
anymore, I'm serious.

10:57.123 --> 10:58.490
That's her angry voice.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.559
Nedra...

11:01.560 --> 11:03.428
So who was the bitch
antagonizing people?

11:03.429 --> 11:04.796
Is ready to pick a fight.

11:04.797 --> 11:06.431
Ring the bell
if you want to play.

11:06.432 --> 11:07.832
Ding-ding.
Ding-ding-ding.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.200
Well, let's go, !

11:09.201 --> 11:10.301
No, no, no, no, no.

11:10.302 --> 11:11.536
Look, I don't want
to say nothin'.

11:11.537 --> 11:12.537
Okay, that's what I thought.

11:12.538 --> 11:13.805
Get y'all together.

11:13.806 --> 11:16.975
Smooches!

11:16.976 --> 11:19.844
They ain't had nothing to say.
That's what I thought.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.080
<i>Guys, don't
cook with your emotions.</i>

11:22.081 --> 11:24.416
Unless it's fire and passion.

11:24.417 --> 11:25.984
Yeah.

11:25.985 --> 11:27.419
I don't give a .

11:27.420 --> 11:28.586
You think I'm here to make
friends with the females?

11:28.587 --> 11:29.888
<i>Uh-uh, I'm here
to win a challenge</i>

11:29.889 --> 11:30.989
with my boys in blue.

11:30.990 --> 11:32.590
Nedra can try to blow
the house down

11:32.591 --> 11:33.658
for all I care.

11:33.659 --> 11:35.193
I can almost guarantee
a win tonight.

11:35.194 --> 11:38.129
So it's on and popping now,
bitch.

11:38.130 --> 11:40.865
<i>I'm ready to, seriously,
like, tear it up.</i>

11:40.866 --> 11:42.867
I am like, so "Game on"
right now.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.370
I want to blow
their out.

11:46.806 --> 11:49.240
With both teams
in a fighting mood...

11:49.241 --> 11:50.775
Show 'em what we're
made of, ladies.

11:50.776 --> 11:52.877
And dinner service
less than an hour away...

11:52.878 --> 11:54.112
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, guys.

11:54.113 --> 11:55.246
<i>Quickly.
Big night.</i>

11:55.247 --> 11:56.881
Chef Ramsay wants the chefs

11:56.882 --> 11:58.650
to focus on the task at hand.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.618
We've had
some respectable moments

12:00.619 --> 12:01.886
in Hell's Kitchen so far, yes?

12:01.887 --> 12:03.154
Yes, chef.

12:03.155 --> 12:04.756
But nowhere near
the consistency, okay,

12:04.757 --> 12:06.057
that we really need.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.493
<i>And if the kitchen
isn't running properly,</i>

12:08.494 --> 12:11.262
the ones that are taking
the brunt of it

12:11.263 --> 12:14.666
are Jean-Philippe
and his wait staff.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.935
Uh, Jean-Philippe,
please.

12:16.936 --> 12:18.303
<i>Can you give</i>

12:18.304 --> 12:19.337
both the red team
and the blue team

12:19.338 --> 12:21.906
a little insight
to how much crap

12:21.907 --> 12:23.274
you have to take sometimes.

12:23.275 --> 12:24.709
<i>Frankly, honestly,</i>

12:24.710 --> 12:26.911
it's been an absolute,
living nightmare.

12:26.912 --> 12:29.614
No, on my hands and my knees
with every single table.

12:29.615 --> 12:32.150
I'm sorry, I do have
a bit of proud though.

12:32.151 --> 12:33.351
Jamie, come over, please.

12:33.352 --> 12:34.686
<i>Give us a little insight</i>

12:34.687 --> 12:35.854
into the kind of crap
that you've had to endure

12:35.855 --> 12:36.888
as well, please.

12:36.889 --> 12:38.757
I almost lost my job
the other night.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.725
<i>I had a table,
and I watched them</i>

12:40.726 --> 12:43.194
complain to Jean-Philippe
about me.

12:43.195 --> 12:45.230
Jean-Philippe called me
in there to reprimand me,

12:45.231 --> 12:47.432
and that's when he found out it
was because of the kitchen.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.000
I have never been a waiter,

12:49.001 --> 12:50.568
but I feel terrible.

12:50.569 --> 12:51.936
You can really mess up
someone's life

12:51.937 --> 12:53.471
if you're a bad cook.

12:53.472 --> 12:55.940
I had a couple
that came from Arizona.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.209
It was their vacation
to come here and eat.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.878
Two hours later,
when they didn't eat,

12:59.879 --> 13:03.214
out of frustration,
they got up and they left.

13:03.215 --> 13:05.917
I don't like waiters.
'em, they're annoying.

13:05.918 --> 13:08.419
Nothing could have
bummed me out more than that.

13:08.420 --> 13:11.422
I know they go through
some , but so do we.

13:11.423 --> 13:12.490
So tonight,

13:12.491 --> 13:15.994
I want one individual
from each team

13:15.995 --> 13:17.562
<i>to be a waiter.</i>

13:17.563 --> 13:19.364
Tonight's redemption.
Tonight, we give back.

13:19.365 --> 13:20.932
Tonight, we support them

13:20.933 --> 13:22.200
<i>a little bit more.</i>

13:22.201 --> 13:23.268
<i>Ladies...</i>

13:23.269 --> 13:24.969
Jessica...
Yes, chef?

13:24.970 --> 13:26.538
<i>Dining room tonight.
Yes, chef.</i>

13:26.539 --> 13:29.974
I've never been a server
my entire life.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.976
In my heart, I don't want
to be out there,

13:31.977 --> 13:33.444
but I'm doing it for the team.

13:33.445 --> 13:34.445
<i>Men...</i>

13:34.446 --> 13:35.713
Barret.

13:35.714 --> 13:37.282
<i>Tonight, you're
the blue team's waiter.</i>

13:37.283 --> 13:38.983
Yes, chef.
We're opening

13:38.984 --> 13:40.351
in just under
30 minutes from now.

13:40.352 --> 13:41.352
Let's go.

13:41.353 --> 13:42.654
Yes, chef!

13:42.655 --> 13:43.922
Are you kidding me?
I got no time.

13:43.923 --> 13:45.957
Takes me a half hour
to do my hair.

13:45.958 --> 13:49.360
I gotta rinse it,
blow-dry it,

13:49.361 --> 13:51.596
straighten it.

13:51.597 --> 13:53.431
Then put the glue in it,
and then check it,

13:53.432 --> 13:54.599
and then check it again.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.969
And then spray it,
and then check it again.

13:57.970 --> 14:00.271
It's a half hour process
just to get my hair this way.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.875
Barret?
Yes.

14:03.876 --> 14:05.710
That's the way you're
gonna be looking tonight?

14:05.711 --> 14:07.178
Yes. How are you?

14:07.179 --> 14:08.313
Yeah?
Not too bad, and you?

14:08.314 --> 14:09.314
Pleasure to meet you.
Good, I'm doing well.

14:09.315 --> 14:10.481
Yeah, hi.
Hi.

14:10.482 --> 14:11.883
How are you? Good. How are you?

14:11.884 --> 14:12.917
Yeah, good.
Keep your smile,

14:12.918 --> 14:14.085
because you might need it.

14:14.086 --> 14:15.587
It's the only weapon
you have to...

14:15.588 --> 14:18.289
Okay.
I was a waiter for six years.

14:18.290 --> 14:19.691
Of course I know
how to write a ticket.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.692
So I'm super confident...
confidence level

14:20.693 --> 14:22.460
is up here right now.

14:22.461 --> 14:23.995
Right, where's
the Belgian muscle?

14:23.996 --> 14:25.997
Jean-Philippe,
open Hell's Kitchen, please.

14:25.998 --> 14:27.999
Let's go.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.140
It's a marathon, ladies.

14:36.141 --> 14:38.009
<i>We gotta pace ourselves right.</i>

14:38.010 --> 14:39.677
Game faces.

14:39.678 --> 14:41.880
Now, the amount
of mise en place here

14:41.881 --> 14:43.581
is extraordinary.

14:43.582 --> 14:45.250
Here they come, boys.

14:45.251 --> 14:46.818
Tonight, Hell's Kitchen opens

14:46.819 --> 14:48.453
for its second service
of the day.

14:48.454 --> 14:50.622
We gonna do this, ladies?
Yeah, we got this!

14:50.623 --> 14:52.457
And both teams are confident

14:52.458 --> 14:53.458
that they will score a victory.

14:53.459 --> 14:54.926
Here we go, boys.

14:54.927 --> 14:57.395
But before the
teams can start cooking...

14:57.396 --> 14:58.630
Jean, what is she doing?

14:58.631 --> 15:00.465
They'll need a ticket.

15:00.466 --> 15:01.599
She looks confused.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.734
Um...
Jessica...

15:02.735 --> 15:04.869
<i>Yes, chef?
Let's go, please.</i>

15:06.338 --> 15:08.940
I'm nervous going out
into the dining room.

15:08.941 --> 15:10.275
I've never been a server.

15:10.276 --> 15:11.643
Where's the red?

15:11.644 --> 15:13.111
I just want to be back
in the kitchen.

15:13.112 --> 15:15.346
I would love the pan-seared
scallops, please.

15:15.347 --> 15:16.347
Okay.

15:16.348 --> 15:17.682
<i>Where's Barret?</i>

15:17.683 --> 15:20.051
Where's the lizard?

15:20.052 --> 15:21.519
What would you like
to start off with?

15:21.520 --> 15:24.088
Can I do the crab cappellini?

15:24.089 --> 15:26.057
Crab cappellini?
Excellent choice.

15:26.058 --> 15:27.425
Barret!

15:27.426 --> 15:29.427
<i>I need some tickets, please.</i>

15:29.428 --> 15:30.795
Barret, what's going on there?

15:30.796 --> 15:31.963
<i>I'm working on it, chef.</i>

15:31.964 --> 15:33.064
No, but come on, Barret.

15:33.065 --> 15:34.065
I need a bit of energy
in there, yes?

15:34.066 --> 15:35.066
Yes, chef.
Let's go.

15:35.067 --> 15:36.067
Let's start service.

15:36.068 --> 15:37.335
Come on, let's start service.

15:37.336 --> 15:38.503
Oh, I wanna start service.

15:38.504 --> 15:39.637
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

15:39.638 --> 15:40.638
Hey! Blue team!

15:40.639 --> 15:41.773
Guys, pay attention!

15:41.774 --> 15:44.075
On order, four covers,
table 23.

15:44.076 --> 15:45.443
I mean... ah, me.

15:45.444 --> 15:46.477
<i>Look at... hey, hey.</i>

15:46.478 --> 15:48.513
Look at the way
he wrote that ticket.

15:48.514 --> 15:50.882
Look at how badly
that's written out.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.216
<i>Barret!
What happened?</i>

15:52.217 --> 15:54.552
<i>Rewrite the ticket!
Where's Jean-Philippe?</i>

15:54.553 --> 15:56.020
<i>Jean-Philippe,
what is that?</i>

15:56.021 --> 15:57.789
Oh, my...
oh, off.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.857
Hey, J.P., take him
and yourself

15:59.858 --> 16:01.426
back to Belgium.

16:01.427 --> 16:03.861
Thanks.

16:03.862 --> 16:05.964
right off.
off.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.099
Hey, Barret, it's not
rocket science there, huh?

16:08.100 --> 16:09.334
I know.
Yeah, you know.

16:09.335 --> 16:10.601
I know. I'm sorry.

16:10.602 --> 16:13.104
J.P. is like...

16:13.105 --> 16:15.440
I just want to grab it
and, like, throw it away.

16:15.441 --> 16:17.041
But I can't do that.

16:17.042 --> 16:19.410
<i>Jessica, why are these tickets</i>

16:19.411 --> 16:21.212
taking so long?
Sorry, chef.

16:21.213 --> 16:23.114
Hey, come here,
you... stop.

16:23.115 --> 16:25.583
Do you know what I mean?
Look. What is that?

16:25.584 --> 16:27.285
Huh? Is that two or three?
Sorry, chef, that's...

16:27.286 --> 16:28.753
what is that?
Ah, off, just...

16:28.754 --> 16:29.754
Jessica, how long
were you in school for?

16:29.755 --> 16:30.922
Six months, chef.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.724
You only went to school
for six months?

16:32.725 --> 16:35.259
Yes, chef.
. Hurry up.

16:35.260 --> 16:36.327
Really? Come on.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.563
My handwriting is not that bad.

16:42.768 --> 16:44.235
Two seconds.
Don't disappear.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.537
<i>Yes, chef.
Yeah, it's scallops, Risotto.</i>

16:46.538 --> 16:48.339
What is that there?

16:48.340 --> 16:50.208
Oh, my God.
Come on, Barret.

16:50.209 --> 16:51.542
You stupid .

16:51.543 --> 16:53.711
Wellington.
Yeah, but what...

16:53.712 --> 16:55.279
<i>I...</i>

16:55.280 --> 16:58.449
Barret, you got the whole team

16:58.450 --> 17:00.184
riding on your shoulders
right now... come on, buddy.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.552
Halibut?
No, off, Barret.

17:01.553 --> 17:03.087
Write it properly.
Hey, look at me.

17:03.088 --> 17:04.821
Hey, Barret...
Yes, chef?

17:04.823 --> 17:06.290
I got nothing going out!

17:06.290 --> 17:07.892
<i>ng:
Next mistake,</i>

17:07.893 --> 17:09.193
<i>you're history!</i>

17:09.194 --> 17:10.994
Done!

17:16.335 --> 17:18.703
Tonight in hell's
kitchen, Jessica and Barret

17:18.704 --> 17:20.939
are serving as waiters
for their teams,

17:20.940 --> 17:22.574
but 20 minutes
into dinner service,

17:22.575 --> 17:24.943
their illegible tickets...
What is that there?

17:24.944 --> 17:26.877
Have both
kitchens at a standstill.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.313
Useless.

17:28.314 --> 17:29.614
Write it out neatly.
Let's go.

17:29.615 --> 17:31.483
Hey, Barret.
Yes, chef?

17:31.484 --> 17:33.685
hair looks beautiful.
Tickets look dreadful.

17:33.686 --> 17:34.886
<i>Let's go, come on.
Yes, chef.</i>

17:34.887 --> 17:36.721
Whew.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.623
Thanks, chef Ramsay.
Appreciate it.

17:38.624 --> 17:41.159
I have enough
already without this.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.494
Huh?
I apologize.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.129
I don't need this.
I apologize.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.498
Whatever. I just don't have
the best handwriting

17:46.499 --> 17:48.833
in the world,
so, you know, if...

17:48.834 --> 17:50.101
If you want to me
to write like a bitch,

17:50.102 --> 17:53.571
I guess I'll have
to write like a bitch.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.173
Thank you. That's better.
Yes, chef.

17:55.174 --> 17:56.174
Yeah, welcome
to the real world.

17:56.175 --> 17:57.542
Let's go.
Yes, chef.

17:59.178 --> 18:01.146
Two twos... two on table 42
and table 41.

18:01.147 --> 18:02.380
<i>Let's do two Risotto,
two scallops.</i>

18:02.381 --> 18:03.381
Yes, chef!

18:03.382 --> 18:04.683
Let's go.

18:04.684 --> 18:05.784
Susan, I'm waiting on my call

18:05.785 --> 18:07.886
for scallops from you.
Okay.

18:07.887 --> 18:08.987
Susan...
Yes, chef?

18:08.988 --> 18:09.988
Yeah, you're driving
the section, yes?

18:09.989 --> 18:10.989
Yes, chef.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.257
He asked me to lead,

18:12.258 --> 18:14.325
and I do not want
to disappoint chef Ramsay.

18:14.326 --> 18:16.227
This is absolutely
the most nervous I've felt,

18:16.228 --> 18:17.862
and the most pressure
that I've had

18:17.863 --> 18:19.364
since I've been
in Hell's Kitchen.

18:19.365 --> 18:20.365
Let's go.
Wake up, love.

18:20.366 --> 18:21.533
One minute, chef!

18:21.534 --> 18:23.401
Slow down, slow down.
Slow down?

18:23.402 --> 18:24.402
Slow down.
Okay.

18:24.403 --> 18:25.737
Dropping scallops!

18:27.106 --> 18:28.740
<i>Scallops, risotto.</i>

18:28.741 --> 18:29.841
Come on, ladies.
Where are they?

18:29.842 --> 18:31.743
Is the lobster ready
for the risotto?

18:31.744 --> 18:33.078
I'm ready.
Yes, yes, let's go.

18:33.079 --> 18:34.112
Good, let's go!

18:34.113 --> 18:35.580
Behind you, hot.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.248
Susan, no.
I'm flipping my scallops.

18:37.249 --> 18:38.750
Don't walk yet.

18:38.751 --> 18:39.984
Behind you, chef.

18:39.985 --> 18:41.586
Susan was just really focused

18:41.587 --> 18:43.555
on getting those risottos out,

18:43.556 --> 18:44.956
which I appreciate,

18:44.957 --> 18:47.125
but we need to go up together.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.393
<i>Scallops!
They should be done.</i>

18:48.394 --> 18:49.594
Come on!

18:49.595 --> 18:50.729
I'm goin'!
I'm walkin'!

18:50.730 --> 18:52.330
Scallops walkin'!

18:52.331 --> 18:54.399
Behind you.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.601
Service, table 41.
Let's go.

18:56.602 --> 18:59.003
While Susan gets
the red kitchen fired up...

18:59.004 --> 19:00.972
Careful.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.007
Over in the blue kitchen...

19:03.008 --> 19:05.176
The men are hoping Barret
finally delivers

19:05.177 --> 19:08.179
an acceptable ticket
so they can fire something.

19:08.180 --> 19:11.182
Hey, Barret, plain English.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.322
That's better.

19:17.323 --> 19:19.491
Ohh, God!

19:19.492 --> 19:21.159
Thank you!

19:21.160 --> 19:22.794
Here we go, guys.
On order,

19:22.795 --> 19:24.229
two risotto,
one cappellini, one scallops.

19:24.230 --> 19:25.897
<i>Yes, chef!
Thank you.</i>

19:25.898 --> 19:27.732
Drop the scallops.
Come on.

19:27.733 --> 19:29.234
What's that?
The scallops.

19:29.235 --> 19:32.003
Okay, how many orders?
Two.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.004
You sure?

19:33.005 --> 19:34.672
Mike.
Hello?

19:34.673 --> 19:35.673
Two scallops, right?

19:35.674 --> 19:36.674
Or is it one?

19:36.675 --> 19:38.676
Two scallops, right?

19:38.677 --> 19:40.211
<i>It is two?
Yep.</i>

19:40.212 --> 19:42.313
I don't know what's going on
on that fish station right now,

19:42.314 --> 19:44.616
but these guys
really gotta get it together.

19:44.617 --> 19:45.617
All right, great.
What do you want me

19:45.618 --> 19:47.385
to do for you, man?
Nothing.

19:47.386 --> 19:48.853
"Can I cook?
You gonna let me cook?

19:48.854 --> 19:50.655
Can I try?
Can I be the limelight?"

19:50.656 --> 19:52.490
No. Sorry, no.

19:52.491 --> 19:53.491
<i>I need tongs.</i>

19:53.492 --> 19:54.626
Can I have tongs, please?

19:54.627 --> 19:56.161
Tongs?
Yeah.

19:56.162 --> 19:57.195
Here you go.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.097
Here you go, Ray.
Here you go.

19:59.098 --> 20:00.799
I'm gonna make your life
a little easier.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.901
Dude, I wanna cook
a few things today too.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.136
Why don't you give me some
pan time here.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.738
Let's go!
Yes, chef!

20:06.739 --> 20:07.839
Let's go!
Ready to walk.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.073
Wait, wait, wait.
Ray...

20:09.074 --> 20:10.875
Come on, get it up!

20:12.344 --> 20:14.612
They're overcooked.

20:14.613 --> 20:16.114
They're overcooked!

20:16.115 --> 20:18.316
They are overcooked.

20:18.317 --> 20:19.317
no way.

20:19.318 --> 20:20.385
Come here, you.
Raymond!

20:20.386 --> 20:22.654
<i>Yes, chef.
Rubber. Rubber!</i>

20:22.655 --> 20:23.888
Get the pan hot!

20:23.889 --> 20:25.023
Yes, chef.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.891
Every time we start
a challenge or service,

20:26.892 --> 20:29.027
you have these senior moments.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.895
It's like it's a seizure.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.263
sake, Ray!

20:32.264 --> 20:34.065
Get your together!
Yes, chef.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.000
There's two of you guys
over there, right?

20:36.001 --> 20:37.168
Get it together.

20:37.169 --> 20:38.803
<i>Come on, Ray!</i>

20:38.804 --> 20:40.438
<i>Comin' up, chef!</i>

20:40.439 --> 20:41.506
Scallops are here, chef.

20:41.507 --> 20:42.774
Come on.
To your right, chef.

20:45.177 --> 20:46.511
<i>Ray...</i>

20:46.512 --> 20:47.679
Raymond...

20:47.680 --> 20:50.682
Ray.
Yes, chef?

20:50.683 --> 20:52.083
That's how to cook scallops.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.384
Aye-aye, chef.
Aye-aye, chef.

20:53.385 --> 20:54.619
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah!</i>

20:54.620 --> 20:55.820
Come on, boys.

20:55.821 --> 20:57.121
Now that Ray has bounced back

20:57.122 --> 20:58.122
on the fish station...

20:58.123 --> 20:59.157
Go.

20:59.158 --> 21:00.258
Appetizers are finally

21:00.259 --> 21:02.026
making their way out
to hungry diners.

21:02.027 --> 21:03.561
Enjoy, guys.
Thank you.

21:03.562 --> 21:04.729
Service, please.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.030
And, back in the red kitchen,

21:06.031 --> 21:07.198
Susan...
We're doing this, ladies!

21:07.199 --> 21:08.867
We're not
going home tonight!

21:08.868 --> 21:10.268
No!
No, we're not!

21:10.269 --> 21:12.670
Susan, let me know when you're
two minutes on risotto.

21:12.671 --> 21:15.306
Is not about to
let anything slow her down...

21:15.307 --> 21:16.841
Looks good,
looks good, looks good.

21:16.842 --> 21:18.710
Wait to fire scallops,
remember...

21:18.711 --> 21:20.345
Not even if
the rest of the food

21:20.346 --> 21:21.913
on the order isn't ready.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.748
This is the two, two.
Are you ready on risotto?

21:23.749 --> 21:24.749
Yes, ready!

21:24.750 --> 21:25.984
<i>Walk, walk!</i>

21:25.985 --> 21:27.418
Why is nobody waiting for me

21:27.419 --> 21:28.686
with the scallops?

21:28.687 --> 21:29.754
<i>We're calling out,
"Are you ready?"</i>

21:29.755 --> 21:30.755
<i>You gotta listen!</i>

21:30.756 --> 21:31.856
Pay attention!
Talk back!

21:31.857 --> 21:33.157
We're talking!

21:33.158 --> 21:34.859
Come on, ladies,
I got nothing going out.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.361
Yes, chef, waiting
on the scallops, chef.

21:36.362 --> 21:39.964
Susan, this is just complete
and absolute .

21:39.965 --> 21:41.132
Drive it.
Drive it, Susan.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.167
Can you walk on that?

21:43.168 --> 21:45.370
I can't stop what I'm doing
and say to her,

21:45.371 --> 21:47.505
"Amanda, two minutes.

21:47.506 --> 21:49.741
Drop your scallops now."

21:49.742 --> 21:51.009
I mean, come the on.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.010
Can we walk?

21:52.011 --> 21:53.278
Walk those.

21:53.279 --> 21:54.479
Walking with scallops!

21:54.480 --> 21:55.747
Scallops, chef.

21:56.882 --> 21:58.883
hell.

21:58.884 --> 22:01.052
<i>Scallop is raw!
.</i>

22:01.053 --> 22:02.487
Stone cold in the middle.
Who cooked them?

22:02.488 --> 22:04.289
I did, chef.
Come on! Let's go!

22:04.290 --> 22:05.723
I got another one going, chef.

22:05.724 --> 22:06.758
Back in the pan!

22:06.759 --> 22:08.092
<i>They're not overcooked,</i>

22:08.093 --> 22:10.628
so you put them
back in the pan!

22:10.629 --> 22:11.629
Look at her.

22:11.630 --> 22:12.997
I'm sorry, chef.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.265
Just hurry up and do it!

22:14.266 --> 22:15.700
Yes, chef!
I'm hurrying.

22:15.701 --> 22:18.369
Ohh, my God.

22:18.370 --> 22:19.771
Wakey wakey, Amanda!

22:19.772 --> 22:21.272
Yes, chef!
Are you ready?

22:21.273 --> 22:23.675
<i>Scallops!
Right now, chef!</i>

22:23.676 --> 22:25.143
Behind you, hot.

22:30.149 --> 22:32.216
Good, good, good.
Service, please.

22:32.217 --> 22:35.253
With Amanda's scallops
finally receiving a passing grade...

22:35.254 --> 22:36.621
Here we go, yes?

22:36.622 --> 22:37.989
Appetizers are
leaving the red kitchen

22:37.990 --> 22:39.223
once again.

22:39.224 --> 22:41.793
Meanwhile, nearly an hour
into dinner service,

22:41.794 --> 22:45.163
the blue team has almost
finished their appetizers...

22:45.164 --> 22:47.865
Away now,
three scallops, one cappellini.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.034
And are now
moving on to entrees.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.970
Followed by three halibut,
one pork, two Wellington.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.204
Yes, chef!

22:53.205 --> 22:54.806
Look out, I... Ray, I gotta
cook these scallops.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.507
I understand, buddy.
Put 'em on.

22:56.508 --> 22:57.675
Well, you gotta be a little bit

22:57.676 --> 22:58.676
more organized over here.

22:58.677 --> 23:00.111
Excuse me, buddy.
Yep.

23:00.112 --> 23:03.114
<i>Tell me when you're
reaching in front of me.</i>

23:03.115 --> 23:05.216
You gotta tell me
when you're reaching, Ray.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.151
I keep trying to get in there,

23:07.152 --> 23:08.920
and I keep getting shut down.

23:08.921 --> 23:10.455
He's acting like this
is an NBA game,

23:10.456 --> 23:11.656
and we're at the bottom
of the key.

23:11.657 --> 23:13.558
He's just boxing me out.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.660
Can I cook a little today?

23:15.661 --> 23:18.363
I'm still trying... I'm trying
to flip these scallops, man.

23:20.332 --> 23:21.899
Are you kidding me?
Really?

23:21.900 --> 23:24.535
Put a red jacket on,
grab your tampons,

23:24.536 --> 23:26.637
and go on the red team,
please.

23:26.638 --> 23:27.839
Can you do a minute and a half?

23:27.840 --> 23:29.140
I'm gonna do my best...
I just need Ray

23:29.141 --> 23:30.441
to stop reaching over me.

23:30.442 --> 23:31.743
Easy.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.211
Dan, you wanna put
the crust on those?

23:33.212 --> 23:34.512
It's on it!
All right, you're awesome, Dan.

23:34.513 --> 23:35.680
Who's better than you?

23:35.681 --> 23:36.914
Ray, you gotta give me
some space, man.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.116
I can't work throwing
elbows at you.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.484
<i>Really?
Stop it, guys.</i>

23:39.485 --> 23:41.185
Really?
It's about the food now, guys.

23:41.186 --> 23:42.520
<i>We're a team here.
Come on, guys.</i>

23:42.521 --> 23:43.855
We're a team!

23:43.856 --> 23:45.223
I can't take much more of this.

23:45.224 --> 23:47.892
Shut the up right now
and stop fighting

23:47.893 --> 23:49.560
and focus on the food.

23:49.561 --> 23:51.162
Dan, let's go, buddy.

23:51.163 --> 23:52.563
<i>Yeah, come on.
I'm workin' it.</i>

23:52.564 --> 23:54.365
Oh, .

23:54.366 --> 23:56.334
Blue team, I don't
know what the

23:56.335 --> 23:57.702
you two are doing down there...

23:57.703 --> 23:58.770
<i>Tongs.
How long?</i>

23:58.771 --> 24:00.371
Go ahead.
We're coming to the pass.

24:00.372 --> 24:01.372
Let's go, then!

24:01.373 --> 24:02.373
Three sea bass, yep!

24:02.374 --> 24:05.410
Ready?
Down the line!

24:05.411 --> 24:06.444
<i>Wellington...</i>

24:06.445 --> 24:07.745
<i>Time out.
Three bass.</i>

24:07.746 --> 24:08.746
What do you mean, three bass?

24:08.747 --> 24:10.648
I mean, no, two...

24:10.649 --> 24:13.184
Look at you, you don't even
know what's on the order.

24:13.185 --> 24:14.385
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

24:14.386 --> 24:15.486
What is that?

24:15.487 --> 24:17.955
They asked for three...

24:17.956 --> 24:19.190
Three halibuts!

24:19.191 --> 24:20.792
<i>That's what we're going with.</i>

24:20.793 --> 24:22.527
<i>He doesn't even know.</i>

24:22.528 --> 24:23.895
Oh, my God.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.229
That's bass!
That's not halibut!

24:25.230 --> 24:28.166
I know that's bass, dude.
I know that.

24:28.167 --> 24:29.767
What...

24:29.768 --> 24:33.037
Start that table again!

24:33.038 --> 24:35.339
Three halibut, one pork,
two Wellington.

24:35.340 --> 24:36.574
Never mind, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

24:36.575 --> 24:37.608
Dan, Dan, Dan.

24:37.609 --> 24:38.643
Hey, dumber and dumber.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.344
Yes, chef?

24:40.345 --> 24:42.680
Talk to your team,
and one of you

24:42.681 --> 24:43.714
give me a time!

24:43.715 --> 24:44.982
Yes, chef.
Five minutes.

24:44.983 --> 24:46.584
<i>Five... at least five minutes.
Five minutes?</i>

24:46.585 --> 24:48.920
Yeah.
hell.

24:48.921 --> 24:51.889
While Ray and Dan
get the right fish in the pan,

24:51.890 --> 24:54.959
out in the dining room,
Barret is doing his best

24:54.960 --> 24:57.128
to keep impatient diners happy.

24:57.129 --> 24:58.596
How are you guys
doing over here so far?

24:58.597 --> 24:59.797
Starving.

24:59.798 --> 25:01.099
<i>Okay, I'm gonna
check on the food</i>

25:01.100 --> 25:02.100
<i>and see how much longer
I'll be for you.</i>

25:02.101 --> 25:03.468
<i>Okay?
Thank you.</i>

25:03.469 --> 25:04.936
I never wanna do this again.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.438
And, back in the red kitchen...

25:07.439 --> 25:08.940
Three risotto, one scallops.

25:08.941 --> 25:10.708
It's a little loose, chef.
It's coming.

25:10.709 --> 25:12.076
<i>Come on, then, let's go.
Yes, chef.</i>

25:12.077 --> 25:13.478
Susan and Amanda

25:13.479 --> 25:15.279
are working
on their final appetizers.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.948
Nice color, Amanda.
Let's go.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.449
Scallops in less than a minute.

25:18.450 --> 25:19.951
<i>It's all you guys
on this ticket,</i>

25:19.952 --> 25:21.519
<i>so you guys
have to talk to each other.</i>

25:21.520 --> 25:24.522
Susan's really
struggling with Amanda tonight.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.623
We don't communicate.

25:25.624 --> 25:28.826
It's like people
are clams sometimes.

25:28.827 --> 25:31.329
I'm ready on scallops.
I need to walk.

25:31.330 --> 25:33.264
No, not yet.

25:33.265 --> 25:35.566
<i>Walkin' one scallop!</i>

25:35.567 --> 25:37.635
Behind you.

25:37.636 --> 25:39.036
Oh, no.

25:39.037 --> 25:40.138
<i>Risotto.</i>

25:40.139 --> 25:41.806
How we lookin'?
How we lookin'?

25:41.807 --> 25:42.773
I got it, I got it.
Just get the salad.

25:42.774 --> 25:44.075
<i>Okay, thank you.
Come on, yeah?</i>

25:44.076 --> 25:45.076
We're waiting!

25:45.077 --> 25:46.110
Coming, chef!

25:46.111 --> 25:47.812
Yeah, come on, Susan!

25:47.813 --> 25:48.813
<i>Let's go.</i>

25:48.814 --> 25:50.181
Susan, just go.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.249
<i>Go. Go!
Pick it up.</i>

25:51.250 --> 25:52.850
Coming, chef.

25:52.851 --> 25:54.852
Right behind you, chef.

25:56.321 --> 25:57.488
<i>It's undercooked, the rice.</i>

25:57.489 --> 25:59.257
Wow. me.

25:59.258 --> 26:01.292
Hey. Hey.

26:01.293 --> 26:02.827
<i>The rice is undercooked!</i>

26:02.828 --> 26:03.861
The rice is undercooked.

26:03.862 --> 26:06.430
That's not ready yet, guys.

26:06.431 --> 26:07.832
<i>Start again!
Yes, chef.</i>

26:07.833 --> 26:09.167
<i>Come on.</i>

26:09.168 --> 26:10.501
What are you waiting on?

26:10.502 --> 26:13.004
34, chef.
Yeah, c-c-come in here.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.439
Come in here!

26:15.440 --> 26:17.008
How long they been waiting?

26:17.009 --> 26:18.376
20, 30 minutes, chef.

26:18.377 --> 26:20.011
Yeah, they've been actually
waiting 32 minutes.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.779
Tell your team.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.614
Let's go, guys!

26:23.615 --> 26:25.883
<i>Table 34...
No! Why you laughing?</i>

26:25.884 --> 26:27.151
I'm not.
I'm sorry, chef.

26:27.152 --> 26:29.554
Hey, hey, all of you.
Stop.

26:29.555 --> 26:32.990
Come here.
all of you.

26:32.991 --> 26:34.058
You think this is a joke?

26:34.059 --> 26:35.426
No, chef, I don't.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.694
We're dying

26:36.695 --> 26:38.563
on table 34's
appetizers,

26:38.564 --> 26:40.097
and you come in
and laugh at her.

26:40.098 --> 26:41.399
<i>What's funny?
Nothing, chef.</i>

26:41.400 --> 26:42.900
Do you want to go?

26:44.836 --> 26:46.437
<i>Do you want to go?</i>

26:50.525 --> 26:52.726
Nearly two hours
into dinner service...

26:52.727 --> 26:53.994
Come in here!

26:53.995 --> 26:55.829
Susan's undercooked risotto

26:55.830 --> 26:58.498
is holding up the red team's
final appetizer order.

26:58.499 --> 26:59.633
Tell your team!

26:59.634 --> 27:00.834
And though it's clearly

27:00.835 --> 27:02.102
not a laughing matter...

27:02.103 --> 27:04.805
Let's go, guys!
Table 34.

27:04.806 --> 27:08.208
For some reason, Jessica
can't seem to keep a straight face.

27:08.209 --> 27:10.210
You think this is a joke?

27:10.211 --> 27:12.612
Hey, all of you, stop.

27:12.613 --> 27:13.880
We're dying

27:13.881 --> 27:15.749
on table 34's
appetizers,

27:15.750 --> 27:17.551
and you come in
and laugh at her.

27:17.552 --> 27:18.585
<i>What's funny?
Nothing, chef.</i>

27:18.586 --> 27:21.521
Do you want to go?

27:21.522 --> 27:22.522
No, chef, I don't.

27:22.523 --> 27:23.890
Can you tell your team

27:23.891 --> 27:24.891
<i>to hurry up?</i>

27:24.892 --> 27:26.793
Let's go, team!
I'm ready!

27:26.794 --> 27:28.095
Hey, it's not so funny
now, is it?

27:28.096 --> 27:29.363
<i>No, chef.</i>

27:29.364 --> 27:31.431
Everything he says,
he's serious.

27:31.432 --> 27:33.500
If you bust a laugh,

27:33.501 --> 27:35.202
you might as well throw in
the towel, home girl.

27:35.203 --> 27:37.003
<i>Get me that risotto now!</i>

27:37.004 --> 27:38.438
Behind you.

27:38.439 --> 27:40.741
<i>Coming, chef!
Right now, walking!</i>

27:42.210 --> 27:43.744
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.

27:43.745 --> 27:46.246
Actually tastes quite nice.
Go.

27:46.247 --> 27:47.914
The red team
moves on to entrees.

27:47.915 --> 27:50.150
Two halibut, one pappardelle,
one bass!

27:50.151 --> 27:51.318
Yes, chef!

27:51.319 --> 27:52.552
But in the blue dining room,

27:52.553 --> 27:54.488
instead of serving
Ray's fish...

27:54.489 --> 27:55.789
They haven't gotten
their food yet.

27:55.790 --> 27:57.324
There's only so much
I can do, you know?

27:57.325 --> 28:00.160
Barret is busy
serving up apologies.

28:00.161 --> 28:01.561
I'm used to kitchen etiquette.

28:01.562 --> 28:02.562
I'm sorry, guys.

28:02.563 --> 28:03.930
All right, sorry, guys.

28:03.931 --> 28:06.099
Okay, guys?
I'm sorry about that.

28:06.100 --> 28:07.234
<i>If you need anything, listen,</i>

28:07.235 --> 28:08.668
just throw
a piece of bread at me.

28:08.669 --> 28:10.437
It'll probably get stuck
in my hair, so...I'm okay.

28:10.438 --> 28:11.738
<i>If I have to go in there myself</i>

28:11.739 --> 28:12.873
and kick everybody out to cook,

28:12.874 --> 28:14.141
I will get you guys fed,
I promise.

28:14.142 --> 28:15.776
Ray!

28:15.777 --> 28:19.312
Well, maybe not.

28:19.313 --> 28:20.313
What are you waiting on?

28:20.314 --> 28:21.748
<i>Three halibut and pork.
Yeah?</i>

28:21.749 --> 28:23.183
So how about
asking them?

28:23.184 --> 28:24.484
How 'bout asking
your ... hey!

28:24.485 --> 28:26.186
Hey. Hey, hello.
Do some , will you?

28:26.187 --> 28:27.654
Yes, chef.

28:27.655 --> 28:28.855
Raymond, how long?

28:28.856 --> 28:30.891
Two minutes on the halibut.

28:30.892 --> 28:32.526
You ready with
the pork, Anthony?

28:32.527 --> 28:34.461
I've got pork and two Wellington
ready to go, yes.

28:34.462 --> 28:35.829
Hey, Barret, do you understand

28:35.830 --> 28:37.164
how painful this is?
Yes, chef.

28:37.165 --> 28:38.999
He's been waiting 17 minutes.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
How long, Ray?

28:40.001 --> 28:41.568
It's ready to serve, chef.

28:41.569 --> 28:43.770
Before, with the fish station,
I had a hiccup.

28:43.771 --> 28:44.905
But don't worry, I have it.

28:44.906 --> 28:46.306
Two Wellingtons and a pork
are ready to go.

28:46.307 --> 28:48.542
<i>There, go.
Behind you.</i>

28:48.543 --> 28:51.778
Behind.
Two Wellington, one pork.

28:51.779 --> 28:53.513
Wellington's cooked perfectly.

28:53.514 --> 28:54.548
Don't over-reduce
the sauce.

28:54.549 --> 28:55.715
Thank you, chef, yes!

28:55.716 --> 28:57.517
Come on, Ray!
Yes, chef! Right here!

28:57.518 --> 28:58.752
Walk up with it.

28:58.753 --> 29:00.887
Those better be
the best halibut.

29:00.888 --> 29:01.888
It's not hard.

29:01.889 --> 29:04.458
Here you go, chef.

29:04.459 --> 29:06.726
What has he done to that?

29:09.230 --> 29:10.497
<i>Hey, all of you.
Come here.</i>

29:10.498 --> 29:11.498
Yes, chef?

29:11.499 --> 29:12.933
<i>All of you!
Yes, chef?</i>

29:12.934 --> 29:14.334
<i>You first.
Just touch that.</i>

29:14.335 --> 29:15.602
Just touch.

29:15.603 --> 29:17.504
<i>It's just dry.
Overcooked.</i>

29:17.505 --> 29:19.706
Dry!
That's ridiculous.

29:19.707 --> 29:21.308
Un...believable.

29:21.309 --> 29:22.576
Hey! Hey! Hey.

29:22.577 --> 29:24.244
Dan! Raymond!

29:24.245 --> 29:25.579
<i>You made me wait.
Yes, chef.</i>

29:25.580 --> 29:27.647
And then I wait!
And then I wait!

29:27.648 --> 29:29.983
And then you me!
Didn't mean to, chef.

29:29.984 --> 29:31.751
I'm sinking with
this ship right now.

29:31.752 --> 29:33.286
And the best part is,

29:33.287 --> 29:34.654
I couldn't even
do anything about it,

29:34.655 --> 29:38.091
'cause, uh, Ray wouldn't
let me cook.

29:38.092 --> 29:39.192
Hey! Anthony!

29:39.193 --> 29:40.427
Chef!

29:40.428 --> 29:41.561
<i>Take all your perfectly cooked
Wellingtons...</i>

29:41.562 --> 29:43.763
!

29:43.764 --> 29:45.832
, if I have to kick
someone out of the kitchen

29:45.833 --> 29:47.400
myself, they're getting out.

29:47.401 --> 29:49.069
I'd be furious.

29:49.070 --> 29:51.404
Every meat you've cooked tonight
has been perfect.

29:51.405 --> 29:52.639
Yes, chef.

29:52.640 --> 29:55.041
Sabotaged by somebody
who's not even cooking it!

29:55.042 --> 29:57.477
All right, you guys gotta...
damn it.

29:57.478 --> 29:59.179
<i>Come on, guys,
pull it back together!</i>

29:59.180 --> 30:02.482
While Ray and Dan start
over once again on the halibut,

30:02.483 --> 30:04.050
back in the red kitchen...

30:04.051 --> 30:06.319
Nedra and Mary
on the meat station...

30:06.320 --> 30:07.621
Are you ready to walk, Cyn?

30:07.622 --> 30:09.723
Yeah, get up there!
The garnish just got up there.

30:09.724 --> 30:11.124
<i>Let's go then!
Yes, chef!</i>

30:11.125 --> 30:12.459
All right, walkin'!

30:12.460 --> 30:14.294
Are ready
to impress chef Ramsay

30:14.295 --> 30:15.829
with their first order
of entrees.

30:15.830 --> 30:19.366
Keep up the energy, guys!

30:19.367 --> 30:20.400
Raw pork.

30:20.401 --> 30:22.369
me.

30:22.370 --> 30:24.437
Stop! Stop!

30:24.438 --> 30:25.539
Yes, chef?

30:25.540 --> 30:26.773
<i>Raw pork.</i>

30:26.774 --> 30:29.976
Raw pork.

30:29.977 --> 30:33.246
It is, like, still
oinkin' raw in the middle.

30:33.247 --> 30:35.181
This is when it gets serious!

30:35.182 --> 30:36.716
Raw pork!

30:36.717 --> 30:38.518
Got another one coming, chef.

30:38.519 --> 30:39.719
Let's go!

30:39.720 --> 30:41.054
We can't put it back together

30:41.055 --> 30:42.856
and put it in the oven?

30:42.857 --> 30:43.857
How long?

30:43.858 --> 30:46.192
Give me six minutes, chef!

30:46.193 --> 30:47.193
Six minutes?

30:47.194 --> 30:48.261
What are you doing to me?

30:48.262 --> 30:50.096
<i>Guys, you're gonna kill</i>

30:50.097 --> 30:52.699
the rest of the table!

30:52.700 --> 30:54.601
Here you go, Nedra.

30:54.602 --> 30:57.037
Here's your six minutes.

30:57.038 --> 30:58.872
Take the tray!

30:58.873 --> 31:00.874
There you go.

31:00.875 --> 31:02.375
<i>Mary, there you go.
Yes, chef?</i>

31:02.376 --> 31:04.811
She told me she got
another one... where is it?

31:04.812 --> 31:06.446
It's right here!
In the pan, chef!

31:06.447 --> 31:08.481
So is that
supposed to be funny?

31:08.482 --> 31:10.283
No, I'm not laughing, chef!

31:10.284 --> 31:11.618
When you say,
"I've got one more,"

31:11.619 --> 31:12.953
you haven't got one more.

31:12.954 --> 31:15.288
"I put one more on, chef."
Yes, chef!

31:15.289 --> 31:17.390
I wanna hear the truth
from you a little bit earlier.

31:17.391 --> 31:18.758
So I can relate it
to the customer!

31:18.759 --> 31:19.759
Yes, chef!

31:19.760 --> 31:21.361
Get me Jessica.

31:21.362 --> 31:22.362
Jessica?

31:22.363 --> 31:23.363
Yes, chef?

31:23.364 --> 31:24.531
Hey, you.
Come here, you.

31:24.532 --> 31:25.599
Yes, chef!

31:25.600 --> 31:26.600
Can you take this girl,

31:26.601 --> 31:27.801
<i>and you explain...</i>

31:27.802 --> 31:29.102
how about an apology
to the customer?

31:29.103 --> 31:30.503
Yes, chef.
With a bit of respect.

31:30.504 --> 31:31.504
Yes, chef.
Hurry up!

31:31.505 --> 31:33.173
Yes, chef.
Take her there!

31:33.174 --> 31:34.841
I'm a real bitch, I'm
gonna own up to my .

31:34.842 --> 31:36.443
At the end of the day, like,

31:36.444 --> 31:38.411
if you don't own up to your
, you're full of .

31:38.412 --> 31:39.679
Hi. How y'all doin'?

31:39.680 --> 31:41.514
<i>I'm Nedra, and, um,</i>

31:41.515 --> 31:43.717
I undercooked your LA...
uh, pork,

31:43.718 --> 31:45.719
so it's gonna be
about five more minutes.

31:45.720 --> 31:48.922
I do apologize, um,
thank you for being so patient.

31:48.923 --> 31:49.923
Appreciate it.

31:49.924 --> 31:50.957
Thank you.

31:50.958 --> 31:52.592
Thank you, Nedra.

31:52.593 --> 31:54.527
While Nedra begs
forgiveness in the dining room,

31:54.528 --> 31:55.528
back in the blue kitchen...

31:55.529 --> 31:57.731
Where is the halibut?

31:57.732 --> 31:59.633
<i>Comin' up, chef.
Come on, guys, push it!</i>

31:59.634 --> 32:01.101
Let's go, come on.
Get those up.

32:01.102 --> 32:03.269
Ray hurries to
deliver his third attempt

32:03.270 --> 32:04.938
at the same order of fish.

32:04.939 --> 32:05.972
Where is it?

32:05.973 --> 32:08.041
Right here.
Bring that up.

32:08.042 --> 32:09.442
<i>Got it right here, chef.</i>

32:09.443 --> 32:10.443
Come on, come on.
Go with that.

32:10.444 --> 32:11.911
<i>Good job.</i>

32:11.912 --> 32:14.748
Please, be cooked.
For the love of God, be cooked.

32:16.651 --> 32:18.118
Wellington's
beautifully cooked.

32:18.119 --> 32:19.452
<i>Thank you, chef.
Pork's beautifully cooked.</i>

32:19.453 --> 32:21.121
But I have a problem.

32:21.122 --> 32:24.457
I have a big problem.
Yes, I do!

32:24.458 --> 32:25.558
me.

32:25.559 --> 32:26.760
This is raw!

32:26.761 --> 32:29.129
Oh, my God.
This is raw!

32:29.130 --> 32:31.898
Not again! Damn it!
This can't be happening.

32:31.899 --> 32:32.932
<i>Come on, Ray.</i>

32:32.933 --> 32:34.601
It's just raw!

32:34.602 --> 32:35.869
<i>Get three more going.
Get three more going.</i>

32:35.870 --> 32:37.203
Three more working.
Put 'em in the oven.

32:37.204 --> 32:39.072
It's !

32:39.073 --> 32:40.373
We're going down in flames.

32:40.374 --> 32:42.542
<i>The Titanic ain't got
on us.</i>

32:42.543 --> 32:45.945
I'm done!
You, you, you,

32:45.946 --> 32:47.847
<i>you, you, you,</i>

32:47.848 --> 32:49.482
get out!

32:55.689 --> 32:58.157
Over two hours
into dinner service,

32:58.158 --> 33:00.225
and Ray has failed
for the third time

33:00.226 --> 33:01.326
on the same order.

33:01.327 --> 33:02.494
This is raw!

33:02.495 --> 33:04.396
As a result, the blue team

33:04.397 --> 33:06.198
has yet to serve
a single entree,

33:06.199 --> 33:08.801
and chef Ramsay,
not surprisingly...

33:08.802 --> 33:10.002
I'm done!

33:10.003 --> 33:11.003
Yes, chef.

33:11.004 --> 33:12.337
Has had enough.

33:12.338 --> 33:13.839
Get out!

33:13.840 --> 33:16.675
Get the out of her!

33:16.676 --> 33:19.645
I was doing good, damn it.

33:19.646 --> 33:21.213
<i>Did I not say
they were done?</i>

33:21.214 --> 33:24.349
I will let you know
when to leave it in.

33:24.350 --> 33:26.051
Dan, just leave it alone.

33:26.052 --> 33:28.554
I had it perfect.

33:28.555 --> 33:30.355
Hey!
Where are you guys?

33:30.356 --> 33:31.557
Right here, chef.

33:31.558 --> 33:33.759
I've spent 18 hours
with you guys today.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.360
I give you everything I got,

33:35.361 --> 33:37.196
and that's the
you're gonna give me

33:37.197 --> 33:39.565
in front of chef Ramsay?

33:39.566 --> 33:40.632
<i>Make me look like a </i>

33:40.633 --> 33:42.868
in front of a dining room
full of people.

33:42.869 --> 33:45.370
I'm beside myself right now
with that!

33:45.371 --> 33:47.372
I can't look at you guys
anymore.

33:51.811 --> 33:53.245
Red team!
Yes, chef?

33:53.246 --> 33:55.347
One more mistake,

33:55.348 --> 33:58.016
I'm gonna kick you all out.

33:58.017 --> 33:59.618
Wake up, wake up, yes, chef!

33:59.619 --> 34:01.386
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

34:01.387 --> 34:02.888
Yes, chef!

34:02.889 --> 34:05.190
30 on bass.
Sea bass walking, chef.

34:05.191 --> 34:06.925
Behind you.
Okay, I'm walking.

34:06.926 --> 34:10.027
Garnish is up.
Come on, bubble and squeak.

34:10.029 --> 34:11.697
Coming now, chef!

34:11.697 --> 34:13.364
Right behind you, Suzy.

34:13.366 --> 34:14.699
Yeah, look at the speed of her,

34:14.701 --> 34:16.201
as if nothing else matters.

34:16.202 --> 34:18.437
Right after that,
the pork is coming!

34:18.438 --> 34:21.072
<i>Pork!
Coming, chef!</i>

34:21.074 --> 34:22.474
We're walking with the pork!

34:22.475 --> 34:24.576
We cool, we in a box,
we got it.

34:24.577 --> 34:26.745
Oh, dear.
On the board.

34:26.746 --> 34:29.447
Yes, chef.
Yeah.

34:32.819 --> 34:34.786
That's raw.

34:38.690 --> 34:40.458
Oh, my God.

34:40.460 --> 34:41.460
Come here, all of you!

34:41.460 --> 34:44.096
My God.

34:44.097 --> 34:47.199
<i>Yeah, kept me waiting
28 minutes for raw pork.</i>

34:47.199 --> 34:48.967
You, you,

34:48.967 --> 34:52.304
you, you, you, you, you.

34:52.304 --> 34:55.641
Get out!

34:55.641 --> 34:57.810
Disaster!

34:57.811 --> 35:00.279
Get out!

35:00.280 --> 35:02.714
Well, we gave
it our shot, ladies.

35:02.715 --> 35:04.416
Wasn't good enough.

35:04.417 --> 35:06.985
To get kicked
out of the kitchen

35:06.986 --> 35:09.154
makes you feel like the biggest
failure in the world.

35:09.155 --> 35:11.190
Nedra and Mary,
get it together, girls.

35:11.191 --> 35:13.559
, we were so close.

35:13.560 --> 35:14.760
I think he'd just had enough.

35:14.761 --> 35:15.794
<i>Well, obviously he's pissed off</i>

35:15.795 --> 35:17.629
because of those idiots.

35:20.667 --> 35:22.401
You tell me what you can do.
It is what it is.

35:22.402 --> 35:23.468
Hello?

35:23.469 --> 35:24.770
<i>Get both teams downstairs, now.</i>

35:24.771 --> 35:25.904
Yes, chef.

35:25.905 --> 35:27.139
<i>Both teams
downstairs right now.</i>

35:27.140 --> 35:29.308
<i>That was chef Ramsay.</i>

35:29.309 --> 35:31.743
Let's go.
Leave everything.

35:31.744 --> 35:33.078
Move, move, move, move, move.

35:33.079 --> 35:34.780
<i>Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.</i>

35:34.781 --> 35:37.883
Stay there!
Stay there.

35:37.884 --> 35:39.685
<i>We're not done yet.</i>

35:39.686 --> 35:42.120
Sous chefs and I
are still cooking in there!

35:42.121 --> 35:43.622
<i>There's no winning team.</i>

35:43.623 --> 35:46.058
You both lost.

35:46.059 --> 35:47.559
Think of two individuals
from each team

35:47.560 --> 35:50.796
that you want rid of!

35:50.797 --> 35:52.731
off upstairs.

35:52.732 --> 35:54.733
Unbelievable.

35:57.136 --> 35:59.905
Honestly, it's so unfortunate
that that one pork failed.

35:59.906 --> 36:01.273
<i>I'm sorry
about that pork.</i>

36:01.274 --> 36:03.909
We both touched it.
We both thought it was ready.

36:03.910 --> 36:06.612
I think it's an
extremely easy decision for us.

36:06.613 --> 36:08.614
Meat's on the chopping block.

36:10.683 --> 36:12.217
What the is going on?

36:12.218 --> 36:13.752
I couldn't cook... He wouldn't
let me cook anything.

36:13.753 --> 36:15.821
I cooked two scallops
all night, that was it.

36:15.822 --> 36:16.989
Every time I try
to do something,

36:16.990 --> 36:18.090
he's reaching over,
boxing me out.

36:18.091 --> 36:19.725
"Oh, I got the .
I got the ."

36:19.726 --> 36:20.859
He has me stacking scallops
all night.

36:20.860 --> 36:22.361
I had
poor Dan going,

36:22.362 --> 36:25.197
"Come on, Ray."

36:25.198 --> 36:28.200
Sulkin' on the line,
you little bitch!

36:28.201 --> 36:29.801
Is he callin' me
a little bitch?

36:29.802 --> 36:31.503
Don't you dare
get the to it.

36:31.504 --> 36:33.105
I'm not.
I'm just curious.

36:33.106 --> 36:34.473
Just let me run
the station.

36:34.474 --> 36:35.741
<i>It was perfect!</i>

36:35.742 --> 36:36.909
This is the fight of my life,

36:36.910 --> 36:39.711
and I am not going home
over some .

36:39.712 --> 36:42.614
You put my ass on the line,
I will ruin you.

36:42.615 --> 36:44.216
One piece of pork,
and I'm gonna go home.

36:44.217 --> 36:45.918
You know, like, that sucks.

36:45.919 --> 36:49.454
<i>When I say I had
it, I say I got it.</i>

36:49.455 --> 36:50.756
Guys, shh.

36:50.757 --> 36:51.990
<i>Now I look like a .</i>

36:51.991 --> 36:53.091
Are they gonna fight?

36:53.092 --> 36:54.526
<i>That's my station.</i>

36:54.527 --> 36:56.361
<i>No matter what anybody does,
it's my station.</i>

36:56.362 --> 36:57.796
Our station.
"Can I drive?

36:57.797 --> 36:59.631
Come on, please, daddy?
Can I drive?"

36:59.632 --> 37:01.833
Get the out of my face,
would you, please?

37:01.834 --> 37:03.502
Ray's callin' me a bitch.

37:03.503 --> 37:05.537
But Ray's not saying
to me.

37:05.538 --> 37:07.472
This needs to stop.
Boom!

37:07.473 --> 37:09.474
Hey, dude, shut the up.

37:09.475 --> 37:10.575
<i>"Can I cook?</i>

37:10.576 --> 37:12.477
I wanna cook too.
Please let me cook."

37:12.478 --> 37:13.946
Okay, I don't sound
like a child.

37:13.947 --> 37:17.082
Stop that. You sound like
a little bitch.

37:17.083 --> 37:18.216
Every time you ask me for help,

37:18.217 --> 37:19.451
<i>you just start
reaching across me.</i>

37:19.452 --> 37:20.819
That's because you're
supposed to be there

37:20.820 --> 37:22.721
for support, dude!
I was supporting him!

37:22.722 --> 37:24.222
If he starts to sink,
you hop in!

37:24.223 --> 37:26.091
I tried to hop in!

37:26.092 --> 37:27.426
Yeah, but I didn't ask you to!

37:27.427 --> 37:30.429
You're interfering
with me, bitch!

37:32.298 --> 37:34.199
Don't call me a bitch.
You're a bitch.

37:34.200 --> 37:37.069
do something about it.

37:37.070 --> 37:39.571
Go ahead.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

37:39.572 --> 37:40.973
Ray!

37:44.427 --> 37:46.361
After the
worst dinner service yet,

37:46.362 --> 37:48.730
both teams were kicked
out of the kitchen

37:48.731 --> 37:51.266
and told to nominate
two chefs for elimination.

37:51.267 --> 37:52.600
For the red team,

37:52.601 --> 37:54.302
the decision is an easy one.

37:54.303 --> 37:55.370
Our pork failed.

37:55.371 --> 37:56.972
One piece of pork,
and I'm gonna go home.

37:56.973 --> 37:58.473
You know, like, that sucks.

37:58.474 --> 37:59.874
But on the blue team,

37:59.875 --> 38:02.377
there's been a lot more arguing
than decision-making.

38:02.378 --> 38:06.114
Stop interfering
with me, bitch!

38:06.115 --> 38:07.716
Don't call me a bitch.
You're a bitch.

38:07.717 --> 38:10.018
do something about it.

38:10.019 --> 38:12.721
Go ahead.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

38:12.722 --> 38:14.990
Stop, y'all.
stop.

38:14.991 --> 38:16.691
Ray, you're gonna throw me
under the bus?

38:16.692 --> 38:17.859
You want me to go home?

38:17.860 --> 38:19.094
you.

38:19.095 --> 38:21.796
It's on like
Donkey Kong.

38:37.113 --> 38:38.613
That was a disaster, right?

38:38.614 --> 38:40.949
Yes, chef.

38:40.950 --> 38:42.751
Susan...

38:42.752 --> 38:44.119
Red team's first nominee
and why.

38:44.120 --> 38:46.855
Chef, our first nominee
this evening is Mary.

38:46.856 --> 38:49.491
<i>The biggest downfall
of the red team</i>

38:49.492 --> 38:51.860
was the raw pork.

38:51.861 --> 38:53.428
Second nominee and why.

38:53.429 --> 38:56.164
Chef, our second nominee
is Nedra,

38:56.165 --> 38:57.665
because of the raw pork, chef.

38:57.666 --> 38:59.034
Anthony.

38:59.035 --> 39:01.503
Chef, blue team's
first nominee is Dan.

39:01.504 --> 39:04.472
<i>We feel his performance
on the fish station tonight,</i>

39:04.473 --> 39:07.575
it's what sunk the service.

39:07.576 --> 39:09.477
Second nominee and why.

39:09.478 --> 39:11.513
Our second nominee was Ray.

39:11.514 --> 39:14.149
<i>We had too many dishes
come back,</i>

39:14.150 --> 39:16.518
and we believe it's the reason
we didn't finish service.

39:16.519 --> 39:18.620
<i>Blue, fish...</i>

39:18.621 --> 39:19.854
Huge problem.

39:19.855 --> 39:21.656
<i>Red, meat,</i>

39:21.657 --> 39:24.559
disaster.

39:24.560 --> 39:26.261
All four of you, step forward.

39:31.067 --> 39:33.601
Mary, tell me why you think

39:33.602 --> 39:35.336
you should stay
in Hell's Kitchen.

39:35.337 --> 39:37.739
<i>Chef, I didn't have
any other mistakes tonight.</i>

39:37.740 --> 39:39.307
Pork was the one mistake.

39:39.308 --> 39:42.077
She started it in the pan,
and I finished it in the oven.

39:42.078 --> 39:43.878
We brought it out.
We checked it several times,

39:43.879 --> 39:45.780
<i>and it was still raw,
and I'm very sorry.</i>

39:45.781 --> 39:47.215
And I own that mistake, chef.

39:47.216 --> 39:48.550
Nedra.

39:48.551 --> 39:50.318
We up
on the pork, chef.

39:50.319 --> 39:51.786
I can't make excuses.

39:51.787 --> 39:53.822
<i>So I'm telling you
here today, I apologize.</i>

39:53.823 --> 39:56.558
I extremely apologize,
and it won't happen again...

39:56.559 --> 39:59.461
ever!

39:59.462 --> 40:00.762
Ray.

40:00.763 --> 40:02.597
I'm telling you,
you'll see a lot from me, chef.

40:02.598 --> 40:03.932
I'm telling you,
I have a lot to give.

40:03.933 --> 40:05.600
Don't give up on me, chef.

40:05.601 --> 40:07.535
<i>Dan.
I'm a team player.</i>

40:07.536 --> 40:08.903
I kept trying to support him.

40:08.904 --> 40:10.839
<i>Dan, I pull the fish out...</i>

40:10.840 --> 40:12.073
Can I finish a sentence, please?

40:12.074 --> 40:13.108
<i>No. I pull
the fish out...</i>

40:13.109 --> 40:14.175
I got nothin' to say, chef.

40:14.176 --> 40:15.677
And then you put it back
in the oven.

40:15.678 --> 40:17.112
I said it was done.
I said it was perfect.

40:17.113 --> 40:18.146
It was hard.

40:18.147 --> 40:19.247
Chef, since they want to argue,

40:19.248 --> 40:20.248
I'm gonna fight for my life.

40:20.249 --> 40:21.583
I want to be here.

40:21.584 --> 40:23.051
They can argue
all they want.

40:23.052 --> 40:25.286
But I want to be here!

40:26.555 --> 40:27.989
<i>Chef,</i>

40:27.990 --> 40:28.990
when chef Ray's cooking,

40:28.991 --> 40:30.859
you hear Dan
saying smart things

40:30.860 --> 40:32.594
<i>like, "Ray's in my way,"</i>

40:32.595 --> 40:34.129
<i>and we can't move forward</i>

40:34.130 --> 40:35.363
with somebody like that.

40:35.364 --> 40:37.599
He's full of , chef.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.334
<i>And, chef, right now,</i>

40:39.335 --> 40:41.369
if you don't believe me,
as I'm telling you this,

40:41.370 --> 40:43.371
he's literally giving me
the finger behind his back.

40:43.372 --> 40:44.439
<i>Oh, I did.</i>

40:44.440 --> 40:45.473
I just gave him
the finger, chef.

40:45.474 --> 40:46.474
He's what?

40:46.475 --> 40:48.009
<i>He's doing like...</i>

40:48.010 --> 40:49.444
he's doing like this
to me right now...

40:49.445 --> 40:50.512
<i>Yeah.
Behind your back.</i>

40:50.513 --> 40:51.779
<i>This is the kind of attitude</i>

40:51.780 --> 40:54.215
<i>that we put up with
on a consistent basis.</i>

40:54.216 --> 40:55.683
And the team is sick of it.

40:55.684 --> 40:57.619
<i>You know,
after all this </i>

40:57.620 --> 40:59.020
<i>and the bad performances,</i>

40:59.021 --> 41:02.223
I've definitely got
the right four here.

41:04.627 --> 41:06.127
<i>What I'm struggling with</i>

41:06.128 --> 41:09.130
is which one of you
to send home.

41:15.738 --> 41:17.810
My decision is...

41:20.355 --> 41:22.310
Ray.
Give me your jacket.

41:26.215 --> 41:28.983
Dan!

41:28.984 --> 41:30.485
Give me your jacket, please.

41:33.589 --> 41:36.057
Nedra, give me
your jacket, please.

41:40.663 --> 41:43.364
Mary, give me
your jacket, please.

41:46.969 --> 41:48.203
<i>Tonight...</i>

41:48.204 --> 41:50.705
was such a disaster,

41:50.706 --> 41:53.041
I've decided to do something
I've never, ever,

41:53.042 --> 41:56.144
ever done before.

41:56.145 --> 41:59.147
All four of you...

42:05.621 --> 42:09.124
Next time, chef Ramsay
turns the competition on its head.

42:09.125 --> 42:10.592
<i>One, two, three, four of you.</i>

42:10.593 --> 42:12.427
I'm done.
I've had enough.

42:12.428 --> 42:15.497
Chef, are you
kidding me right now?

42:15.498 --> 42:16.798
At dinner service...

42:16.799 --> 42:18.233
So how long
for the chef's table?

42:18.234 --> 42:20.435
With special
guests in the kitchen...

42:20.436 --> 42:21.870
How long on that lamb?

42:21.871 --> 42:22.938
The pressure to perform...

42:22.939 --> 42:24.272
<i>I just dropped my lamb.</i>

42:24.273 --> 42:25.674
They screwed up our order.

42:25.675 --> 42:28.076
Sends the red
team into a tailspin...

42:28.077 --> 42:29.811
It's becoming chaos.

42:29.812 --> 42:31.680
And forces a VIP
out the door.

42:31.681 --> 42:33.081
It's a nightmare.

42:33.082 --> 42:34.683
!

42:34.684 --> 42:36.752
And you won't
believe what one chef...

42:36.753 --> 42:38.687
I just need to get through
this dinner service.

42:38.688 --> 42:40.355
Tries to get away with.

42:40.356 --> 42:42.023
Hey...All of you,
come here.

42:42.024 --> 42:44.059
See those six ladies?
And look...

42:44.060 --> 42:45.427
Ohh. Ohh.

42:45.428 --> 42:47.664
What the you doing?
You trying to kill people?

42:47.665 --> 42:50.239
This is catastrophically terrible.

42:50.240 --> 42:51.571
All next time...

42:51.572 --> 42:53.651
You're done, aren't you?
Is that the best you can do?

42:53.652 --> 42:55.337
On Hell's Kitchen.
