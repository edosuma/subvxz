WEBVTT

00:01.550 --> 00:02.817
<i>Previously on Rescue Me...</i>

00:02.852 --> 00:04.083
I would like the chaise

00:04.119 --> 00:05.435
Lounge.

00:05.470 --> 00:06.716
What?

00:06.751 --> 00:08.434
The chaise lounge. It's the

00:08.469 --> 00:11.143
Chair that matches the couch.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.214
Hey! Tommy! What--God, does this

00:13.249 --> 00:15.250
Make you feel more like a man,

00:15.285 --> 00:17.382
Huh?

00:17.417 --> 00:18.984
If visiting Jeannie has made

00:19.019 --> 00:20.116
You have doubts about us--

00:20.151 --> 00:21.884
It's not that. I gotta go and

00:21.919 --> 00:22.882
See her brother.

00:22.917 --> 00:24.617
Your sister Jeannie, she's sick.

00:24.652 --> 00:26.101
If she's sick, she's sick.

00:26.136 --> 00:27.550
Nothing I can do for her.

00:27.585 --> 00:28.916
I need your help.

00:28.951 --> 00:30.067
Get out of my showroom.

00:30.102 --> 00:31.259
You know, you seem like

00:31.294 --> 00:32.472
You've been a dad forever.

00:32.506 --> 00:33.712
I couldn't handle it. I put

00:33.747 --> 00:34.917
Her up for adoption, and she got

00:34.952 --> 00:36.201
Placed with this, uh--This

00:36.236 --> 00:37.193
Family, these pigs, you know.

00:37.228 --> 00:38.339
All they cared about was their

00:38.374 --> 00:39.812
Monthly check from the state.

00:39.847 --> 00:40.849
And so, I stole her back.

00:40.884 --> 00:41.851
What do you mean you

00:41.886 --> 00:42.849
Stole her?

00:42.884 --> 00:43.549
Yeah. Well, you know,

00:43.584 --> 00:44.350
People like that are never gonna

00:44.385 --> 00:44.982
Call the cops.

00:45.017 --> 00:46.133
Let me get this straight.

00:46.168 --> 00:47.442
You don't want your freedom?

00:47.477 --> 00:48.714
No, and I want it to stay

00:48.749 --> 00:49.951
That way. You know I'm gettin'

00:49.986 --> 00:51.016
Marriage proposals?

00:51.051 --> 00:52.817
My wife, whom I love dearly,

00:52.852 --> 00:54.549
Left me for another man.

00:54.584 --> 00:55.983
She broke my heart, and then she

00:56.018 --> 00:57.451
Took nearly everything that I

00:57.486 --> 00:58.918
Owned, all right? And then I met

00:58.953 --> 01:00.251
Another woman, and at the end,

01:00.286 --> 01:01.550
She took every penny that I had

01:01.585 --> 01:02.382
On earth.

01:02.417 --> 01:03.382
Everything?

01:03.417 --> 01:04.717
Every cent I had.

01:04.751 --> 01:05.682
Wow.

01:05.717 --> 01:06.650
Just wondering if I could

01:06.685 --> 01:07.667
Maybe just crash here for

01:07.702 --> 01:09.042
A little while, you know.

01:09.077 --> 01:10.348
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

01:10.383 --> 01:11.217
You know, we live together

01:11.252 --> 01:12.334
And everything, but it's not

01:12.369 --> 01:13.417
Like we sleep together or kiss

01:13.452 --> 01:14.515
Or any of that shit.

01:14.550 --> 01:15.767
Yeah, it's just blow jobs.

01:15.802 --> 01:16.984
So you think you'll ever wanna

01:17.019 --> 01:17.615
Try it?

01:17.650 --> 01:18.315
Try what?

01:18.350 --> 01:19.600
Going down on me.

01:19.635 --> 01:20.816
Uh, no, dude. Never.

01:20.851 --> 01:21.817
You gonna fill in for your

01:21.852 --> 01:22.784
Nephew, you better raise your

01:22.819 --> 01:23.649
Game.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.617
This is tyranny. Ohh!

01:25.652 --> 01:28.183
Ahh. Ohh! Ho.

01:28.218 --> 01:29.017
I thought I was supposed to

01:29.052 --> 01:29.749
Tend bar.

01:29.784 --> 01:30.784
Yeah, that was the plan, but,

01:30.819 --> 01:31.918
Uh, we gonna wait for some

01:31.953 --> 01:33.035
Shifts to open up first.

01:33.070 --> 01:34.343
Listen, Tommy, including

01:34.378 --> 01:35.617
Garrity, I got 4 guys in line

01:35.652 --> 01:37.615
Right now. No, 5.

01:37.650 --> 01:38.567
You know, if she were dating

01:38.602 --> 01:39.484
4 other guys, I'd think I'd know

01:39.519 --> 01:40.248
About it, OK?

01:40.283 --> 01:40.949
Do yourself a favor.

01:40.984 --> 01:41.900
Walk away from the relationship.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.159
You know what, Tom? This is

01:43.194 --> 01:44.355
You just being you, you know,

01:44.390 --> 01:45.503
Overprotective and not thinking

01:45.538 --> 01:46.617
I'm good enough for your sister.

01:46.652 --> 01:47.717
That is not the issue,

01:47.752 --> 01:48.248
Believe me.

01:48.283 --> 01:50.250
She's my girlfriend.

01:50.285 --> 01:52.218
Yeah, one other thing,

01:52.253 --> 01:53.535
Asshole.

01:53.570 --> 01:54.782
What?

01:54.817 --> 01:56.450
Don't tell her I mentioned

01:56.485 --> 01:58.084
This stuff to you, all right?

01:58.119 --> 02:00.617
Please?

02:03.717 --> 02:05.417
Hey, should we move the, uh,

02:05.452 --> 02:07.118
Chaise lounge down to the truck

02:07.153 --> 02:08.015
Now, Tommy?

02:08.050 --> 02:09.317
That's the chaise lounge? I--

02:09.352 --> 02:10.584
I thought that was the chaise

02:10.619 --> 02:11.149
Lounge.

02:11.184 --> 02:12.084
No, that's the se-Tay.

02:12.119 --> 02:13.515
Settee.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.084
Uh, it's a bench, but French.

02:15.119 --> 02:16.382
A French bench.

02:16.417 --> 02:17.383
Yeah. My mom has one.

02:17.418 --> 02:17.982
Should we move it?

02:18.017 --> 02:18.951
No. Small stuff first,

02:18.986 --> 02:19.884
Asshole. This kid's

02:19.919 --> 02:21.183
Unbelievable.

02:21.218 --> 02:22.515
We're out of suds.

02:22.550 --> 02:23.584
Oh. I thought you were, uh,

02:23.619 --> 02:24.582
Trying to pull back.

02:24.617 --> 02:25.500
What, it's my day off,

02:25.535 --> 02:26.592
I can't have a few beers?

02:26.627 --> 02:27.650
12's a few in your book,

02:27.685 --> 02:28.183
I guess.

02:28.218 --> 02:29.417
Actually it was more like 15.

02:29.452 --> 02:30.449
Listen, Tom, this whole

02:30.484 --> 02:31.867
Transition thing, I mean, giving

02:31.902 --> 02:33.109
All this stuff up to Janet, you

02:33.144 --> 02:34.230
Know, I mean, the finality of it

02:34.265 --> 02:35.317
All, I know it's--It's gonna be

02:35.352 --> 02:36.716
Kind of tough on you.

02:36.751 --> 02:37.567
Are you kidding? I can't wait

02:37.602 --> 02:38.393
To get rid of this frilly shit.

02:38.428 --> 02:39.172
I feel like I've been taking it

02:39.207 --> 02:39.917
Up the ass for, like, a month

02:39.952 --> 02:40.515
Now.

02:40.550 --> 02:42.117
All I'm saying is I went

02:42.152 --> 02:43.684
Through the same thing with...

02:43.719 --> 02:45.749
with ph...

02:45.784 --> 02:46.749
phyllis. Say it.

02:46.784 --> 02:47.817
Yeah. Her. You know, and--

02:47.852 --> 02:48.582
You know, look, there's

02:48.617 --> 02:49.484
A shoulder here if you need it.

02:49.519 --> 02:50.183
That's all I'm saying.

02:50.218 --> 02:51.350
Yeah. You're the crybaby,

02:51.385 --> 02:52.116
Not me.

02:52.151 --> 02:52.917
I'm here for you, asshole.

02:52.952 --> 02:53.682
That's all I'm saying.

02:53.717 --> 02:54.482
I know you're here, pal.

02:54.517 --> 02:55.500
I don't know if it's necessarily

02:55.535 --> 02:56.484
For me, but--You sure you wanna

02:56.519 --> 02:57.449
Do that?

02:57.484 --> 02:58.917
What are you, my sponsor now?

02:58.952 --> 03:00.350
See the name on the bottle?

03:00.385 --> 03:02.550
Ooh. Beer run.

03:02.585 --> 03:03.884
See ya.

03:03.919 --> 03:05.149
Bye.

03:05.184 --> 03:06.050
Come on, probie. Let's go.

03:06.085 --> 03:06.917
Get that shit off the coffee

03:06.952 --> 03:07.917
Table, too, all right?

03:07.952 --> 03:08.482
OK.

03:08.517 --> 03:10.184
Hurry up!

03:10.219 --> 03:11.851
All right.

03:11.886 --> 03:13.248
Hey.

03:13.283 --> 03:13.682
Am I late?

03:13.717 --> 03:14.449
Get up. This ain't the

03:14.484 --> 03:15.317
Firehouse, OK? You can't sleep

03:15.352 --> 03:16.215
On this job.

03:16.250 --> 03:17.184
Sorry. Maggie kept me up

03:17.219 --> 03:17.916
All night.

03:17.951 --> 03:18.767
Oh, yeah? I don't wanna hear

03:18.802 --> 03:19.709
About it, OK? My old man's been

03:19.744 --> 03:20.597
Downstairs watching the truck

03:20.632 --> 03:21.450
For, like, an hour. Let's go.

03:21.485 --> 03:22.649
Pussy.

03:22.684 --> 03:23.584
What, being tired makes me

03:23.619 --> 03:24.348
A pussy?

03:24.383 --> 03:25.400
No, not talking to my sister

03:25.435 --> 03:26.417
About her 5 other boyfriends,

03:26.452 --> 03:27.449
That makes you a pussy.

03:27.484 --> 03:28.584
Wait a second. 5? I thought

03:28.619 --> 03:30.415
You said it was 3.

03:30.450 --> 03:31.650
OK, I think it's 4. I think

03:31.685 --> 03:32.601
It's 4. But either way. Anyways.

03:32.636 --> 03:33.459
You know what? How do you

03:33.494 --> 03:34.283
Know I haven't already talked

03:34.318 --> 03:34.849
To her?

03:34.884 --> 03:35.850
Because if you told her what

03:35.885 --> 03:36.817
I told you to tell her, she'd be

03:36.852 --> 03:37.450
Over here right now with

03:37.485 --> 03:38.215
A baseball bat.

03:38.250 --> 03:38.984
Why do you want me to talk to

03:39.019 --> 03:39.916
Her so badly, huh?

03:39.951 --> 03:40.867
Because I want you to be

03:40.902 --> 03:41.993
A man, OK, instead of a little

03:42.028 --> 03:42.956
Pussy, which is what you are.

03:42.991 --> 03:43.971
No, you're just trying to

03:44.006 --> 03:44.951
Mess with my head so that I hang

03:44.986 --> 03:46.918
Myself like fred.

03:46.953 --> 03:48.816
High school fred?

03:48.851 --> 03:49.684
Suicide fred, the guy that

03:49.719 --> 03:50.482
You got so jealous. He was

03:50.517 --> 03:51.300
Dating Maggie behind your back,

03:51.335 --> 03:52.084
And you messed with him until he

03:52.119 --> 03:52.982
Hung himself.

03:53.017 --> 03:54.250
OK. Sit down. We gonna talk.

03:54.285 --> 03:55.484
You're not gonna hit me,

03:55.519 --> 03:56.149
Are you?

03:56.184 --> 03:59.617
Only if it helps. Sit down.

03:59.652 --> 04:01.951
Christ almighty.

04:01.986 --> 04:03.083
Mmm.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.417
Would you like more tea?

04:04.452 --> 04:05.701
Yes, I would. Thank you very

04:05.736 --> 04:06.951
Much. What are we drinking this

04:06.986 --> 04:08.116
Time?

04:08.151 --> 04:08.816
Peppermint.

04:08.851 --> 04:09.649
Peppermint. I love

04:09.684 --> 04:10.750
Peppermint. Oh, but that's

04:10.785 --> 04:11.817
A little hot. May I have some

04:11.852 --> 04:12.934
Cream, please?

04:12.969 --> 04:14.126
There you go.

04:14.161 --> 04:15.248
Thank you.

04:15.283 --> 04:17.183
Are you going away soon?

04:17.218 --> 04:19.084
No, sweetie. Why do you

04:19.119 --> 04:20.116
Say that?

04:20.151 --> 04:21.184
Mommy and auntie laura

04:21.219 --> 04:23.635
Went away.

04:23.670 --> 04:26.016
Come here.

04:26.051 --> 04:28.800
Listen. Are you good at keeping

04:28.835 --> 04:31.076
A secret? Yeah? I had a little

04:31.111 --> 04:32.964
Girl once, and she went away

04:32.999 --> 04:34.817
Just like your mommy did.

04:34.852 --> 04:35.849
Up to heaven?

04:35.884 --> 04:38.467
Yeah, and, um, when that

04:38.502 --> 04:40.776
Happened, I was very, very sad,

04:40.811 --> 04:42.497
And I know how much that hurts,

04:42.532 --> 04:44.184
And so I would never want you to

04:44.219 --> 04:45.818
Feel that way again.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.085
So you won't go away?

04:47.120 --> 04:48.317
Well, not unless you want

04:48.352 --> 04:48.949
Me to.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.218
I want us to be together

04:50.253 --> 04:52.682
Forever.

04:52.717 --> 04:54.250
Well, I'll see what I can do

04:54.285 --> 04:56.649
About that. OK?

04:56.684 --> 04:57.983
Watch the wall. Watch the

04:58.018 --> 04:59.283
Door. OK? Especially the

04:59.318 --> 05:00.334
Hallway, you know?

05:00.369 --> 05:01.350
Come on, probie.

05:01.385 --> 05:02.684
Careful.

05:02.719 --> 05:03.851
Stuck.

05:03.886 --> 05:04.868
Watch it.

05:04.903 --> 05:06.160
Sorry.

05:06.195 --> 05:07.382
Idiots.

05:07.417 --> 05:08.084
This is my last run, bro.

05:08.119 --> 05:09.049
I gotta take off.

05:09.084 --> 05:10.034
Ah, your little sugar mama

05:10.069 --> 05:11.010
Takin' you out on the town?

05:11.045 --> 05:12.081
Nah. She's watching the kid

05:12.116 --> 05:13.118
For me while I hit the books.

05:13.153 --> 05:14.116
OK. Bye.

05:14.151 --> 05:14.984
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

05:15.019 --> 05:16.118
See ya. Thanks, man.

05:16.153 --> 05:17.051
Yeah.

05:18.584 --> 05:20.134
Hey. Yoo-Hoo. You know pops

05:20.169 --> 05:21.576
Is out there drinking beers in

05:21.611 --> 05:22.984
The truck with this smoking turd

05:23.019 --> 05:23.649
In his mouth?

05:23.684 --> 05:25.517
OK, that's probably Lou's.

05:25.552 --> 05:27.350
Yeah. How long's that gonna

05:27.385 --> 05:28.415
Go on, by the way?

05:28.450 --> 05:29.317
Lou's just crashing here.

05:29.352 --> 05:30.184
You don't have to worry about

05:30.219 --> 05:30.916
Him, OK?

05:30.951 --> 05:32.567
Ohh! This place reeks of

05:32.602 --> 05:34.184
Beer farts, and cigar smoke.

05:34.219 --> 05:36.315
Oh, well.

05:36.350 --> 05:38.784
My God. It's really empty.

05:38.819 --> 05:40.785
You OK with this?

05:40.820 --> 05:42.716
Yeah. I'm fine.

05:42.751 --> 05:45.984
Oh. Oh! You will never guess

05:46.019 --> 05:47.617
Who I ran into today.

05:47.652 --> 05:48.482
Satan.

05:48.517 --> 05:50.234
No. Angela.

05:50.269 --> 05:51.916
Johnny's ex?

05:51.951 --> 05:53.534
Yes! I was shopping uptown,

05:53.569 --> 05:54.943
And I wanted to go to the hair

05:54.978 --> 05:56.281
Salon, um, this really great one

05:56.316 --> 05:57.500
On the corner of 78th and lex,

05:57.535 --> 05:59.276
And who do I bump into but

05:59.311 --> 06:00.982
Angie. And, um, we went to

06:01.017 --> 06:02.467
Lunch. We went to this fabulous

06:02.502 --> 06:03.917
Japanese place in--What are you

06:03.952 --> 06:04.749
Doing?

06:04.784 --> 06:06.667
I'm making a cheese sandwich.

06:06.702 --> 06:08.243
Oh. Anyway, so she totally

06:08.278 --> 06:09.664
Picked up the tab, and she was

06:09.699 --> 06:11.108
Telling me all about her girls

06:11.143 --> 06:13.213
And her unbelievable career,

06:13.248 --> 06:14.882
And she looks amazing, and we

06:14.917 --> 06:16.367
Had such a good time, and she

06:16.402 --> 06:17.626
Said she was gonna call me.

06:17.661 --> 06:18.851
Heh heh heh. Do you think she's

06:18.886 --> 06:19.716
Gonna call me?

06:19.751 --> 06:21.051
Uhh. Don't see why she

06:21.086 --> 06:22.784
Wouldn't.

06:24.784 --> 06:25.917
Hey, look, I'm sorry I'm

06:25.952 --> 06:27.049
Late. I got caught up.

06:27.084 --> 06:28.134
No worries, dude. Bring up

06:28.169 --> 06:29.243
Some ice for me, would you?

06:29.278 --> 06:30.317
Yeah. What do you got there,

06:30.352 --> 06:31.282
Basketball pool?

06:31.317 --> 06:32.650
Every year, the pot gets

06:32.685 --> 06:33.984
Bigger. I'm not sure why people

06:34.019 --> 06:35.282
Keep picking gonzaga.

06:35.317 --> 06:36.283
Well, they got a pretty good

06:36.318 --> 06:36.982
Club this year.

06:37.017 --> 06:38.100
Yeah, but it sounds like

06:38.135 --> 06:39.176
A freakin' clown college. Would

06:39.211 --> 06:40.364
You pay 80 grand to send your

06:40.399 --> 06:41.517
Kid to a school named gonzaga?

06:41.552 --> 06:42.734
At the rate I'm goin',

06:42.769 --> 06:44.109
I can't even afford bus fare.

06:44.144 --> 06:45.497
But you got your tips, right?

06:45.532 --> 06:46.624
Yeah, all 80 bucks of it.

06:46.659 --> 06:47.717
I thought you said I was gonna

06:47.752 --> 06:48.449
Be bartending.

06:48.484 --> 06:49.450
Be patient, jer. The checks

06:49.485 --> 06:50.584
Are being processed. You'll be

06:50.619 --> 06:52.285
Pourin' before you know it.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.916
Look, here's an advance.

06:53.951 --> 06:56.367
100 bucks should tide you over.

06:56.402 --> 06:58.784
Great. What's the take on

06:58.819 --> 06:59.968
This pot anyway?

07:00.003 --> 07:01.118
Close to 6 grand.

07:01.153 --> 07:01.949
Oof.

07:01.984 --> 07:02.784
It's 20 bucks a bracket.

07:02.819 --> 07:05.415
You want in?

07:05.450 --> 07:06.550
Nah, I--I think I'll pass.

07:06.585 --> 07:07.651
Aw, come on, jer. You gotta

07:07.686 --> 07:08.717
Be in it to win it. Don't be

07:08.752 --> 07:10.650
A pussy.

07:12.717 --> 07:14.717
All right, give me 5 sheets.

07:14.752 --> 07:17.017
Attaboy. Who you like?

07:17.052 --> 07:19.283
Who else? Gonzaga.

07:50.984 --> 07:54.000
Hey.

07:54.035 --> 07:56.982
You OK?

07:57.017 --> 07:59.051
Found his mitt.

08:07.784 --> 08:10.218
It's OK.

08:13.884 --> 08:16.484
It's OK.

08:24.917 --> 08:26.550
What are you doing?

08:26.585 --> 08:27.315
What?

08:27.350 --> 08:28.650
What--What are you kissin'

08:28.685 --> 08:30.116
Me for?

08:30.151 --> 08:30.951
Uh, I thought that's what

08:30.986 --> 08:31.882
You wanted.

08:31.917 --> 08:33.317
I--Why--Why would you

08:33.352 --> 08:33.916
Think that?

08:33.951 --> 08:34.582
I don't know, Tommy.

08:34.616 --> 08:35.549
You're being all gay and crying.

08:35.585 --> 08:36.501
I thought I'd take a shot.

08:36.535 --> 08:37.381
I wasn't crying, OK?

08:37.417 --> 08:38.866
What do you expect from me?

08:38.902 --> 08:40.359
Right? You ask me to come over

08:40.394 --> 08:41.817
Here every day, a-And you throw

08:41.852 --> 08:42.916
Me all these glances.

08:42.951 --> 08:43.984
What? Like I'm throwing you

08:44.019 --> 08:45.017
Glances. What are you talking

08:45.052 --> 08:45.315
About?

08:45.350 --> 08:46.184
Yes. You're throwin' me

08:46.219 --> 08:46.751
Glances all the time.

08:46.786 --> 08:47.149
Like what?

08:47.184 --> 08:48.384
Like just glances over here

08:48.419 --> 08:49.584
And funny glances and sneaky

08:49.619 --> 08:50.248
Glances.

08:50.283 --> 08:51.515
It's--That's called

08:51.550 --> 08:52.733
Communicating with somebody.

08:52.768 --> 08:54.059
That's how you--You make eye

08:54.094 --> 08:55.315
Contact with them. It's--

08:55.350 --> 08:56.584
Especially somebody who lives up

08:56.619 --> 08:57.749
Your ass.

08:57.784 --> 08:59.784
Oh. I'm living up your ass?

08:59.819 --> 09:01.734
Yeah. You're up my ass.

09:01.769 --> 09:03.860
I come over here every day,

09:03.895 --> 09:05.989
And I deliver medicine, and I

09:06.024 --> 09:08.084
Cook, and I do laundry...

09:08.119 --> 09:08.749
this speech.

09:08.784 --> 09:09.851
And I clean up shit and piss.

09:09.886 --> 09:10.650
I'm really tired of this

09:10.685 --> 09:11.882
Goddamn speech.

09:11.917 --> 09:12.849
I got news for you.

09:12.884 --> 09:14.051
I couldn't possibly live up your

09:14.086 --> 09:15.568
Ass, because you've already

09:15.603 --> 09:17.051
Taken up residence there.

09:22.917 --> 09:24.751
Same time tomorrow?

09:24.786 --> 09:26.484
Bite me.

09:36.084 --> 09:37.717
* on another day,

09:37.752 --> 09:39.315
Come on, come on,

09:39.350 --> 09:40.984
With these ropes I tied,

09:41.019 --> 09:42.751
Can we do no wrong?

09:42.786 --> 09:44.183
Now we grieve

09:44.218 --> 09:45.750
'Cause now is gone,

09:45.785 --> 09:47.401
Things were good

09:47.436 --> 09:48.982
When we were young,

09:49.017 --> 09:50.517
With my teeth locked down,

09:50.552 --> 09:52.218
I can see the blood

09:52.253 --> 09:53.849
Of a thousand men

09:53.884 --> 09:55.584
Who have come and gone,

09:55.619 --> 09:57.116
Now we grieve

09:57.151 --> 09:58.734
'Cause now is gone,

09:58.769 --> 10:00.376
Things were good

10:00.411 --> 10:01.980
When we were young,

10:02.015 --> 10:03.616
Is it safe to say?

10:03.651 --> 10:05.183
Come on, come on,

10:05.218 --> 10:06.851
Was it right to leave?

10:06.886 --> 10:08.468
Come on, come on,

10:08.503 --> 10:10.076
Will I ever learn?

10:10.111 --> 10:11.730
Come on, come on,

10:11.765 --> 10:13.474
Come on, come on,

10:13.509 --> 10:15.184
Come on, come on *

10:20.784 --> 10:22.617
Oh, baby. I like this one.

10:22.652 --> 10:24.450
No way, homey. Bitch be

10:24.485 --> 10:25.616
Codependent.

10:25.651 --> 10:26.816
How can you tell?

10:26.851 --> 10:27.782
See that wrinkle in her

10:27.817 --> 10:29.484
Forehead? Might as well have it

10:29.519 --> 10:30.951
Tagged across her chest.

10:30.986 --> 10:32.384
Had a bitch like that once.

10:32.419 --> 10:33.849
Killed her.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.567
OK, then. Well, how 'bout

10:35.602 --> 10:37.250
This one? I like one with

10:37.285 --> 10:37.949
A big backyard.

10:37.984 --> 10:40.001
Nah. No way, yo. See that jaw

10:40.036 --> 10:41.726
Line? Bitch got control issues.

10:41.761 --> 10:43.382
Had a bitch like that once.

10:43.417 --> 10:44.933
Let me guess. You killed her.

10:44.968 --> 10:46.376
Killed her dog. She had the

10:46.411 --> 10:48.697
Nerve to lock me out the house.

10:48.732 --> 10:50.984
Ohh. Yeah, daddy. Ha ha ha!

10:51.019 --> 10:52.183
Nah. That one's a guy.

10:52.218 --> 10:53.350
How can you tell?

10:53.385 --> 10:55.248
Don't ask.

10:55.283 --> 10:56.583
Well--Well, look. This isn't

10:56.618 --> 10:57.801
<i>American idol. I just gotta</i>

10:59.061 --> 11:00.182

11:00.217 --> 11:02.084
Visits. I don't bust a nut soon,

11:02.119 --> 11:03.549
I'm gonna explode.

11:03.584 --> 11:04.884
I can help you with that if

11:04.919 --> 11:06.582
You want.

11:06.617 --> 11:08.317
N-No, listen. You're a great

11:08.352 --> 11:09.934
Guy, and I--I like talkin' to

11:09.969 --> 11:11.643
You. You keep a nice cell,

11:11.678 --> 11:13.430
But I'm strictly a real, live

11:13.465 --> 11:15.183
Female pussy type of guy, huh?

11:15.218 --> 11:16.349
N-No offense.

11:16.384 --> 11:19.517
OK. You know, if you just

11:19.552 --> 11:20.083
Took me from--

11:20.118 --> 11:21.601
Ahh yah! Geh geh geh! Eh...

11:21.636 --> 11:23.084
let's just look at some more

11:23.119 --> 11:24.468
Pictures.

11:24.503 --> 11:25.443
A dog?

11:25.478 --> 11:26.349
Yeah.

11:26.384 --> 11:27.283
He told you fred killed

11:27.318 --> 11:28.501
Himself over some stupid dog?

11:28.536 --> 11:29.684
That is such bullshit. He killed

11:29.719 --> 11:30.616
Himself over me.

11:30.651 --> 11:31.617
Yeah, but you said that

11:31.652 --> 11:32.083
Tommy--

11:32.118 --> 11:33.434
No, no. I'm the one he was in

11:33.469 --> 11:34.493
Love with, not some stupid dog.

11:34.528 --> 11:35.539
So wait a second. He didn't

11:35.574 --> 11:36.695
Force him to kill himself. You

11:36.730 --> 11:38.023
Just--You made all that shit up?

11:38.058 --> 11:39.237
No, I'm not saying I did,

11:39.272 --> 11:40.361
And I'm not saying I didn't.

11:40.396 --> 11:41.415
You know what? Maggie,

11:41.450 --> 11:42.583
Why don't you just tell me the

11:42.618 --> 11:43.567
Truth? You know, if you were

11:43.602 --> 11:44.517
Honest with me, I wouldn't be

11:44.552 --> 11:44.949
Mad at you.

11:44.984 --> 11:45.784
You know what? I didn't want

11:45.819 --> 11:46.618
You to think I was crazy.

11:46.653 --> 11:47.918
Oh. Well, what would have

11:47.953 --> 11:49.101
Given me that idea? And what's

11:49.136 --> 11:50.250
With these other--These other

11:50.285 --> 11:51.616
4 guys, pancho and--

11:51.651 --> 11:52.584
First of all, his name is

11:52.619 --> 11:54.235
Nacho.

11:54.270 --> 11:56.276
Nacho?

11:56.311 --> 11:58.380
And Larry.

11:58.415 --> 12:00.266
And bill.

12:00.301 --> 12:02.083
And otis.

12:02.118 --> 12:03.217
OK. Maggie, I just--I'm not

12:03.252 --> 12:04.317
Gonna play fifth fiddle to

12:04.352 --> 12:05.482
Anyone, OK?

12:05.517 --> 12:06.383
You told me that if I told

12:06.418 --> 12:07.250
You the truth, you wouldn't get

12:07.285 --> 12:07.816
Mad at me.

12:07.851 --> 12:09.317
Well, I lied. How's it feel?

12:09.352 --> 12:10.784
Can I have my shirt, please?

12:20.350 --> 12:22.717
Nacho, OK?

12:50.150 --> 12:53.250
Holy--

13:28.617 --> 13:30.349
Hello.

13:30.384 --> 13:32.817
Alicia, keela, I'm home.

13:35.417 --> 13:39.018
Hello. Guys?

13:46.684 --> 13:48.751
Baby, I--

13:55.617 --> 13:59.084
Miss lofton, are you there?

13:59.119 --> 14:00.118
Miss lofton, it's Franco.

14:00.153 --> 14:01.435
Could you open up, please?

14:01.470 --> 14:02.577
Franco, it's--It's late.

14:02.612 --> 14:03.714
Yeah. I know, miss lofton.

14:03.749 --> 14:04.817
I'm sorry. Is keela here by any

14:04.852 --> 14:05.349
Chance?

14:05.384 --> 14:06.517
Of course not. Alicia came

14:06.552 --> 14:07.534
And picked her up around 4:00,

14:07.569 --> 14:08.517
Just like you said. They should

14:08.552 --> 14:09.349
Be upstairs.

14:09.384 --> 14:10.315
All right, thanks.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.317
Is everything all right?

14:27.084 --> 14:28.200
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Sir!

14:28.235 --> 14:29.317
Out of my way. She's here.

14:29.352 --> 14:30.049
I know it.

14:30.084 --> 14:30.649
Ms. Green has gone to

14:30.684 --> 14:31.467
Her country home for the week.

14:31.502 --> 14:32.359
Yeah? Where is it? Tell me.

14:32.394 --> 14:33.256
I'm not at liberty to say.

14:33.291 --> 14:34.118
Goddamn it, tell me where

14:34.153 --> 14:34.916
She is.

14:34.951 --> 14:36.050
I assure you she will get

14:36.085 --> 14:37.267
Your message, OK? Now please

14:37.302 --> 14:38.450
Leave the premises, or I'll call

14:38.485 --> 14:39.684
The police.

14:39.719 --> 14:40.884
Oh, yeah?

14:58.284 --> 15:00.216
Yeah?

15:00.251 --> 15:01.382
Hey, Chief.

15:01.417 --> 15:03.417
What do you want, probie?

15:05.884 --> 15:07.451
Can I get another, uh,

15:07.486 --> 15:08.748
Cd-30 form?

15:08.783 --> 15:09.650
What happened to the first

15:09.685 --> 15:11.082
One I gave you?

15:11.117 --> 15:13.615
I kind of lost it.

15:13.650 --> 15:15.650
Yeah. That tends to happen

15:15.685 --> 15:17.449
Quite a bit.

15:17.484 --> 15:18.950
Can--Can we keep this between

15:18.985 --> 15:20.915
Us like before?

15:20.950 --> 15:22.250
I got no reason to share it.

15:22.285 --> 15:23.901
Frankly, I don't think anybody'd

15:23.936 --> 15:25.476
Give a shit. Surprised it took

15:25.511 --> 15:27.114
You this long. The way they rag

15:27.149 --> 15:28.717
On you, some of the worst shit

15:28.752 --> 15:30.017
I've ever seen. Bunch of

15:30.052 --> 15:31.382
Assholes.

15:31.417 --> 15:32.384
Well, you know, they are my

15:32.419 --> 15:33.682
Friends.

15:33.717 --> 15:35.550
Heh. You know, I've never had

15:35.585 --> 15:37.384
Any friends on this job. They're

15:37.419 --> 15:38.601
Your friends till somebody

15:38.636 --> 15:39.760
Drinks too much beer and then

15:39.795 --> 15:40.849
Smashes your face in with

15:40.884 --> 15:44.384
An aluminum chair. With friends

15:44.419 --> 15:46.634
Like that, who needs friends?

15:46.669 --> 15:48.850
Now get outta here. I got work

15:48.885 --> 15:50.618
To do.

15:57.717 --> 15:58.483
Hey.

15:58.518 --> 15:58.882
Hey, "t."

15:58.917 --> 15:59.817
Hey, where you been, man? The

15:59.852 --> 16:00.685
Chief's been lookin' for you.

16:00.720 --> 16:01.518
Man, I got a huge goddamn

16:01.553 --> 16:02.050
Problem, Tommy.

16:02.085 --> 16:02.516
What?

16:02.551 --> 16:03.217
The chick I been seeing,

16:03.252 --> 16:03.651
Man...

16:03.686 --> 16:04.015
yeah.

16:04.050 --> 16:04.783
She took my little girl, man.

16:04.818 --> 16:05.249
She took keela.

16:05.284 --> 16:06.551
Aw, man. You didn't tell her

16:06.586 --> 16:07.301
About the foster family?

16:07.336 --> 16:08.017
Yeah, I did, all right?

16:08.052 --> 16:08.568
Aw, shit, Franco.

16:08.603 --> 16:09.049
It slipped out in

16:09.084 --> 16:09.834
Conversation. How the hell was

16:09.869 --> 16:10.584
I supposed to know she'd use it

16:10.619 --> 16:11.015
Against me, huh?

16:11.050 --> 16:12.883
Goddamn it. Wow. Um, I don't

16:12.918 --> 16:14.534
Know what to tell you. I mean,

16:14.569 --> 16:15.759
I--I could call my cousin eddie

16:15.794 --> 16:16.950
And see if he could come up with

16:16.985 --> 16:17.282
Something.

16:17.317 --> 16:18.050
Yeah, yeah. That would be

16:18.085 --> 16:18.818
Helpful. I mean, dude, I been

16:18.853 --> 16:19.652
Lookin' everywhere, OK? I went

16:19.687 --> 16:20.451
To alicia's apartment. I been to

16:20.486 --> 16:21.002
Keela's school.

16:21.037 --> 16:21.483
OK. Calm down.

16:21.518 --> 16:22.234
All right? It's my little

16:22.269 --> 16:23.260
Girl. I gotta get her back.

16:23.295 --> 16:24.251
Relax. Relax, all right?

16:24.286 --> 16:24.935
I need help, Tommy.

16:24.970 --> 16:25.549
OK, I'll talk to eddie.

16:25.584 --> 16:26.484
We'll see what we can get done.

16:26.519 --> 16:27.151
All right.

16:27.186 --> 16:27.748
All right.

16:27.783 --> 16:28.584
Uh, tell the Chief that I'm,

16:28.619 --> 16:28.917
Uh...

16:29.618 --> 16:30.683
yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

16:30.718 --> 16:32.648
Shit. Hello.

16:32.683 --> 16:33.783
Ooh, you are not gonna

16:33.818 --> 16:34.618
Believe this.

16:34.653 --> 16:35.116
What?

16:35.151 --> 16:36.351
That teacher, Mrs. Turbody,

16:36.386 --> 16:37.418
Damian's teacher, she raped him,

16:37.453 --> 16:38.451
Him and 3 other boys. It's been

16:38.486 --> 16:39.251
All over the news.

16:39.286 --> 16:39.982
You're kidding me.

16:40.017 --> 16:40.984
No. I'd have to be a total

16:41.019 --> 16:42.951
Psycho to kid you about

16:42.986 --> 16:44.834
Something like that. Hi.

16:44.869 --> 16:46.293
I think she raped Damian.

16:46.328 --> 16:47.717
OK, did Damian say that he

16:47.752 --> 16:48.316
Was raped by her?

16:48.351 --> 16:49.217
No, he doesn't have to.

16:49.252 --> 16:50.218
I know how he feels about her.

16:50.253 --> 16:51.184
He spends all that time in

16:51.219 --> 16:51.815
Detention.

16:51.850 --> 16:52.717
Yeah, OK, but that's a hell

16:52.752 --> 16:53.568
Of a leap of faith to go from

16:53.603 --> 16:54.443
Him being in detention with

16:54.478 --> 16:55.580
A teacher he likes to him

16:55.615 --> 16:56.883
Getting raped by her. I mean,

16:56.918 --> 16:58.001
Come on. I'll talk to him.

16:58.036 --> 16:59.110
I'm sure it's, you know--

16:59.145 --> 17:00.184
Doreen selig says that she

17:00.219 --> 17:02.683
Gave them all chlamydia.

17:02.718 --> 17:03.249
Gave who all?

17:03.284 --> 17:04.516
D.J. Apaluso, rodney's

17:04.550 --> 17:05.951
Cousin, she said that rodney and

17:05.986 --> 17:07.351
The 2 other boys, they all have

17:07.386 --> 17:08.915
Chlamydia.

17:08.950 --> 17:10.451
Did Damian say anything

17:10.486 --> 17:10.748
About--

17:10.782 --> 17:11.348
No. Why would he say

17:11.384 --> 17:12.166
Something? You're the one that

17:12.202 --> 17:12.910
Just said that he wouldn't be

17:12.944 --> 17:13.664
Involved, so why would he--

17:13.699 --> 17:14.407
You're answering your own

17:14.443 --> 17:15.195
Question. I'll talk to him.

17:15.231 --> 17:16.589
I'm sure he doesn't even know

17:16.625 --> 17:17.950
What chlamydia is, all right?

17:17.984 --> 17:19.916
Thanks for droppin' by.

17:22.217 --> 17:23.450
Hey, Chief, you see that

17:23.484 --> 17:24.601
Ballgame last night? Man,

17:24.636 --> 17:25.717
I thought gonzaga had it

17:25.752 --> 17:26.516
Locked up.

17:26.550 --> 17:27.251
Yeah, you're not the

17:27.286 --> 17:27.848
Only one.

17:27.884 --> 17:28.817
You see the kid that lost?

17:28.852 --> 17:30.118
He started crying like a baby.

17:30.153 --> 17:31.668
Yeah, he's not the only one.

17:31.703 --> 17:33.184
Authorities say the Thompson

17:33.219 --> 17:34.416
High teacher had improper

17:34.451 --> 17:36.117
Relations with 3 17-Year-Olds,

17:36.152 --> 17:37.901
Students who came forward to

17:37.936 --> 17:39.650
Report the abuse just yesterday.

17:39.685 --> 17:40.867
We'll have an upte at 6:00.

17:40.902 --> 17:42.076
Wh-Wh-What'd they say?

17:42.111 --> 17:43.251
Some teacher raped 3 of

17:43.286 --> 17:44.382
Her students.

17:44.417 --> 17:46.618
Oh. They say anything about,

17:46.653 --> 17:48.648
Um, chlamydia?

17:48.683 --> 17:50.233
Oh, you mean the band?

17:50.268 --> 17:51.726
Ha ha. It's not a band,

17:51.761 --> 17:52.939
You asshole. It's a country.

17:52.974 --> 17:54.117
It's a venereal disease,

17:54.152 --> 17:54.849
Monkeys.

17:54.884 --> 17:56.333
Yeah. What is it, uh--

17:56.368 --> 17:57.748
What does it do to you?

17:57.783 --> 17:58.950
You know, what all sexually

17:58.985 --> 18:00.234
Transmitted diseases do.

18:00.269 --> 18:01.449
It makes you piss fire.

18:01.484 --> 18:02.717
Did they say that those kids,

18:02.752 --> 18:04.184
They--They, uh--They had it

18:04.219 --> 18:05.316
From--From her?

18:05.351 --> 18:06.484
There was no mention of

18:06.519 --> 18:07.449
Chlamydia.

18:07.484 --> 18:08.116
I'm just asking.

18:08.151 --> 18:08.967
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

18:09.002 --> 18:09.783
So wait a second. She rape--

18:09.818 --> 18:10.615
She raped these kids?

18:10.650 --> 18:11.683
She didn't rape anybody.

18:11.718 --> 18:12.767
You can't even call that rape.

18:12.802 --> 18:13.993
I mean, if she looked like

18:14.028 --> 18:15.339
Don knotts in drag, that'd be

18:15.374 --> 18:16.650
One thing, but she was gorgeous.

18:16.685 --> 18:18.034
She's handin' out rapes,

18:18.069 --> 18:19.326
Pick me, teacher. Pick me.

18:19.361 --> 18:20.584
Under 18 is statutory

18:20.619 --> 18:21.583
Rape. That's the law.

18:21.618 --> 18:22.851
It's a stupid law. I mean,

18:22.886 --> 18:24.001
The other way around, sure,

18:24.036 --> 18:25.117
But there's no way a woman that

18:25.152 --> 18:26.483
Good-Looking is raping a

18:26.518 --> 18:27.917
17-Year-Old boy unless she bends

18:27.952 --> 18:29.317
Him over a table and shoves

18:29.352 --> 18:30.668
A swingline stapler up his ass.

18:30.703 --> 18:31.776
I mean, in my humble opinion,

18:31.811 --> 18:33.081
She's providing an invaluable

18:33.116 --> 18:34.351
Service to today's young people.

18:34.386 --> 18:35.835
We should be so lucky.

18:35.870 --> 18:37.284
What do you think, Tom?

18:37.319 --> 18:38.483
Huh?

18:38.518 --> 18:40.715
What do you think?

18:40.750 --> 18:43.017
I gotta take a piss. Ahem.

18:48.717 --> 18:50.551
Ohh, man.

18:52.584 --> 18:53.750
Ahem. Hey.

18:53.785 --> 18:54.882
Hi.

18:54.917 --> 18:56.067
How you doing?

18:56.102 --> 18:57.182
Uh, fine, I guess.

18:57.217 --> 18:59.384
Everything good healthwise

18:59.419 --> 18:59.949
And...

18:59.984 --> 19:01.367
what are you talking about?

19:01.402 --> 19:02.776
I'm making conversation.

19:02.811 --> 19:04.116
Yeah, well, it's odd

19:04.151 --> 19:05.584
Conversation considering what

19:05.619 --> 19:06.748
Just happened.

19:06.783 --> 19:07.950
What do you want

19:07.985 --> 19:08.982
Me to say?

19:09.017 --> 19:10.782
I--I don't know.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.017
I thought for a minute you were

19:12.052 --> 19:13.234
Gonna drive right over us.

19:13.269 --> 19:14.293
Yeah. Well, you know what?

19:14.328 --> 19:15.239
He's lucky you and the girls

19:15.274 --> 19:16.179
Were with him, 'cause that's

19:16.214 --> 19:17.084
Exactly what I had in mind,

19:17.119 --> 19:18.316
Son of a bitch.

19:18.351 --> 19:22.715
So I guess--Look,

19:22.750 --> 19:24.783
I don't know. I don't know.

19:24.818 --> 19:26.317
I gotta go.

19:26.352 --> 19:29.184
Yeah. OK.

19:29.219 --> 19:32.017
Bye. Christ.

19:32.052 --> 19:33.449
Ay yi yi.

19:33.484 --> 19:35.683
It's ironic, ain't it?

19:35.718 --> 19:36.682
Uh, ironic?

19:36.717 --> 19:37.950
Yeah. You know what I'm

19:37.985 --> 19:39.268
Talkin' about. Admit it, Tom.

19:39.303 --> 19:40.551
You jump in the Sack with my old

19:40.586 --> 19:42.385
Lady, and now look at you.

19:42.420 --> 19:44.184
Here you are, your own brother

19:44.219 --> 19:45.715
Puttin' it to your wife.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.284
It's ironic. It's the definition

19:47.319 --> 19:48.249
Of the word.

19:48.284 --> 19:49.650
I don't think so.

19:49.685 --> 19:50.982
Oh, you don't think--

19:51.017 --> 19:52.551
Wh-What is it then, smartass?

19:52.586 --> 19:53.549
Enlighten me.

19:53.584 --> 19:54.451
It's a little thing

19:54.486 --> 19:57.648
Called karma.

19:57.683 --> 19:59.033
Actually, you know what?

19:59.068 --> 20:00.384
You're right. It is karma.

20:00.419 --> 20:01.116
Mm-Hmm.

20:01.151 --> 20:01.950
It is. Yeah. I stand

20:01.985 --> 20:02.849
Corrected.

20:02.884 --> 20:04.934
And the thing about karma is

20:04.969 --> 20:06.984
Just keeps going around and

20:07.019 --> 20:09.449
Around and around.

20:09.484 --> 20:11.834
Tommy, is that--Aw, Jesus.

20:11.869 --> 20:14.593
Did--Come on. Johnny's ex.

20:14.628 --> 20:16.922
It's b--You sick little bitch.

20:16.957 --> 20:18.537
Oh, man. I--You know, and I

20:18.572 --> 20:20.082
Thought you couldn't go any

20:20.117 --> 20:23.351
Lower. I swear you're--You're at

20:23.386 --> 20:24.451
The earth's core with this,

20:24.486 --> 20:25.049
Practically.

20:25.084 --> 20:28.451
Yep. Next stop China.

20:28.486 --> 20:29.949
Where you going?

20:29.984 --> 20:31.884
No, wait a minute. Tommy.

20:44.683 --> 20:46.151
I'll see you later.

20:46.186 --> 20:47.850
OK.

21:10.618 --> 21:11.949
Hey.

21:11.984 --> 21:13.583
Tommy. Hey.

21:13.618 --> 21:14.784
Hey, ange. What's up?

21:14.819 --> 21:15.851
Oh, my God, this is so

21:15.886 --> 21:16.884
Bizarre. What are you doing

21:16.919 --> 21:17.549
Here?

21:17.584 --> 21:18.867
Uh, a friend of mine's over

21:18.902 --> 21:20.076
At lenox hill hospital, and I

21:20.111 --> 21:21.251
Just--I happened to park on this

21:21.286 --> 21:21.949
Block, and--

21:21.984 --> 21:22.817
Oh, I live just over there.

21:22.852 --> 21:23.483
Really?

21:23.518 --> 21:24.484
Yeah, just takin' pumpkin

21:24.519 --> 21:25.583
Here for a walk.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.351
Hey. What a cutie. Yeah.

21:27.386 --> 21:28.835
Yeah. The girls love her.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.110
Guess I would, too, if I didn't

21:30.145 --> 21:31.351
Have to follow her around with

21:31.386 --> 21:32.182
A shit mitt.

21:32.217 --> 21:33.267
How are the girls?

21:33.302 --> 21:34.317
Ah, they're good.

21:34.352 --> 21:35.015
Yeah?

21:35.050 --> 21:35.917
They grow up fast.

21:35.952 --> 21:37.049
Yeah.

21:37.084 --> 21:38.648
How are yours?

21:38.683 --> 21:41.100
Well, they're good,

21:41.135 --> 21:43.483
Considering, you know.

21:43.518 --> 21:45.217
So funny runnin' into you.

21:45.252 --> 21:46.917
Just saw Sheila the other day

21:46.952 --> 21:47.884
Right around the corner,

21:47.919 --> 21:48.483
Actually.

21:48.518 --> 21:49.234
Really? Oh.

21:49.269 --> 21:49.915
Yeah. Yeah.

21:49.950 --> 21:50.650
What are the odds of that?

21:50.685 --> 21:51.516
Heh heh.

21:51.551 --> 21:54.282
Lightning strikes twice.

21:54.317 --> 21:55.950
So do you--You wanna grab a--

21:55.985 --> 21:57.584
A cup of coffee or drink and

21:57.619 --> 21:58.516
Catch up?

21:58.551 --> 22:00.284
Yeah. Sure, sure. We could go

22:00.319 --> 22:02.184
To, um, lexington bar and books.

22:02.219 --> 22:04.050
Lexington and 73rd. Let me just

22:04.085 --> 22:05.384
Drop pumpkin off with the

22:05.419 --> 22:06.049
Doorman.

22:06.084 --> 22:06.850
Do you--You want me to just

22:06.885 --> 22:07.451
Meet you over there?

22:07.486 --> 22:08.216
OK.

22:08.251 --> 22:08.784
All right.

22:08.819 --> 22:09.418
10 minutes.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.218
OK, great.

22:10.253 --> 22:10.985
Yeah. Yeah.

22:11.020 --> 22:11.682
All right.

22:11.717 --> 22:12.584
Say, "good-Bye, Tommy."

22:12.619 --> 22:14.984
Bye, pumpkin.

22:15.019 --> 22:16.817
See ya.

22:28.384 --> 22:30.600
Could I help you, sir?

22:30.635 --> 22:32.226
Oh, uh, nah, I'm cool.

22:32.261 --> 22:33.817
I'm just--I'm lookin' for

22:33.852 --> 22:35.715
A little kid.

22:35.750 --> 22:36.750
Uh, this ain't a flea market,

22:36.785 --> 22:37.583
Pal.

22:37.618 --> 22:39.817
Actually it's my daughter.

22:39.852 --> 22:41.049
She's gone missing.

22:41.084 --> 22:42.117
Uh, well, I could take you

22:42.152 --> 22:43.151
Down to the station. You could

22:43.186 --> 22:44.049
Fill out a report.

22:44.084 --> 22:45.617
You know, uh, actually

22:45.652 --> 22:47.151
That's, uh--That's all right.

22:47.186 --> 22:47.915
You know, I think my

22:47.950 --> 22:48.950
Girlfriend's probably got her.

22:48.985 --> 22:49.650
Yeah, yeah. I'm sure

22:49.685 --> 22:50.282
She does.

22:50.317 --> 22:51.767
Look, officer, it's not like

22:51.802 --> 22:53.217
I'm here shopping for, you know,

22:53.252 --> 22:53.648
A playmate--

22:53.683 --> 22:55.300
Take a walk, freak show.

22:55.335 --> 22:56.917
Yeah. All right. Sorry.

22:56.952 --> 22:58.615
Goddamn sickos.

22:58.650 --> 23:00.800
So Sheil told me about you

23:00.835 --> 23:02.950
And Janet. And you and her.

23:02.985 --> 23:04.382
Yeah.

23:04.417 --> 23:07.150
And Johnny and Janet. Mm-Hmm.

23:07.185 --> 23:09.201
Throw in a brain tumor, throw in

23:09.236 --> 23:11.217
An evil twin, it's an episode of

23:11.252 --> 23:12.317
<i>Young and the restless.</i>

23:12.352 --> 23:14.982
No kiddin'.

23:15.017 --> 23:16.250
You know, I was thinkin' the

23:16.285 --> 23:17.467
Other day about me and Johnny

23:17.502 --> 23:18.826
And how I was always after him

23:18.861 --> 23:20.672
To get hitched, but he was such

23:20.707 --> 23:22.195
A commitment-Phobe. Every time I

23:22.230 --> 23:23.557
Mentioned the "m" word, he would

23:23.592 --> 23:24.884
Say I was getting too clingy.

23:24.919 --> 23:25.648
Hmm.

23:25.683 --> 23:27.151
And then you and Janet tie

23:27.186 --> 23:27.835
The knot...

23:27.870 --> 23:28.449
mm-Hmm.

23:28.484 --> 23:30.150
And a month later, me and him

23:30.185 --> 23:31.768
Were engaged. Took me all this

23:31.803 --> 23:33.351
Time to realize I was always his

23:33.386 --> 23:35.516
Second choice.

23:35.551 --> 23:37.367
Wish I knew that before we spent

23:37.402 --> 23:39.184
6 grand on the goddamn marriage

23:39.219 --> 23:39.915
Counselor.

23:39.950 --> 23:40.783
Well, you're not the only one

23:40.818 --> 23:43.416
He had fooled, you know.

23:43.451 --> 23:44.351
I was his wife. I should've

23:44.386 --> 23:45.282
Picked up on it.

23:45.317 --> 23:49.950
Yeah. So you--You seeing

23:49.985 --> 23:53.084
Anybody now, or...

23:53.119 --> 23:56.184
um, no, not really.

23:56.219 --> 23:57.382
Not really.

23:57.417 --> 23:59.050
I was seeing this wall street

23:59.085 --> 24:01.351
Guy, but, uh, he's too

24:01.386 --> 24:02.485
Possessive.

24:02.520 --> 24:03.549
Jealous?

24:03.584 --> 24:05.484
Mm-Mmm. No, he treated me

24:05.519 --> 24:08.001
Like I belonged to him, like I

24:08.036 --> 24:10.310
Was a lamp. Heh. He's rich,

24:10.345 --> 24:12.584
Though, and he's cute, and he's

24:12.619 --> 24:14.918
Tough, too. He's a boxer.

24:14.953 --> 24:17.035
He's a broker-Slash-Boxer.

24:17.070 --> 24:18.926
Oh. Ha ha ha! Why'd I say

24:18.961 --> 24:20.922
Boxer? He's not a boxer. He's,

24:20.957 --> 24:22.837
Um, ugh. The thing with the

24:22.872 --> 24:24.811
Hands and the feet. He's a--

24:24.846 --> 24:26.748
Kung fu. He's kung fu. Yeah.

24:26.783 --> 24:28.716
He's got a black belt. Or a red

24:28.751 --> 24:30.650
Belt. Whatever--Whichever's the

24:30.685 --> 24:31.416
Toughest belt.

24:31.451 --> 24:33.017
Karate. Karate guy.

24:33.052 --> 24:33.748
Yeah.

24:33.783 --> 24:34.750
Oh. Karate guys are always

24:34.785 --> 24:35.851
Talking about their belts and

24:35.886 --> 24:36.882
What color they are and--

24:36.917 --> 24:38.117
Surprised they don't get a set

24:38.152 --> 24:40.118
Of heels and a handbag to go

24:40.153 --> 24:42.084
With the belt. This guy's still

24:42.119 --> 24:43.449
Around?

24:43.484 --> 24:44.750
Eh, not really. He shows up

24:44.785 --> 24:45.968
Every once in a while,

24:46.003 --> 24:47.476
Checking in on me.

24:47.511 --> 24:48.915
Stalking you?

24:48.950 --> 24:50.317
The occasional surprise

24:50.352 --> 24:51.782
Visit.

24:51.817 --> 24:54.650
So you think, um, he would

24:54.685 --> 24:57.484
Mind if we, you know, got dinner

24:57.519 --> 25:01.915
Sometime?

25:01.950 --> 25:06.584
Ohh. Probably. Oh. Oh, Tommy.

25:06.619 --> 25:08.334
Ooh, I know you too well to

25:08.369 --> 25:09.926
Think you just happened to bump

25:09.961 --> 25:11.484
Into me out on the street there

25:11.519 --> 25:12.284
Today.

25:12.319 --> 25:13.015
What--

25:13.050 --> 25:14.517
You know, given the detailed

25:14.552 --> 25:16.518
Romantic math that Sheila laid

25:16.553 --> 25:18.402
Out for me and our past history,

25:18.437 --> 25:20.043
I know you have some secret evil

25:20.078 --> 25:21.531
Plan in mind, and you know what?

25:21.566 --> 25:23.025
I've grown too mature for that

25:23.060 --> 25:24.722
Old-School, old-Neighborhood

25:24.757 --> 25:26.470
Type of bullshit. I live in

25:26.505 --> 25:28.184
Manhattan now. I've changed.

25:28.219 --> 25:31.134
Thanks for the drink.

25:31.169 --> 25:34.050
I've changed, too.

25:35.917 --> 25:39.817
Quit drinkin'.

25:39.852 --> 25:42.017
Shit.

25:46.317 --> 25:48.816
* sorry * ha ha ha ha!

25:48.851 --> 25:50.167
I swear to God, Jerry, I had

25:50.202 --> 25:51.876
No idea it was karaoke night.

25:51.911 --> 25:53.550
And I had no idea what a great

25:53.585 --> 25:54.582
Voice you have.

25:54.617 --> 25:55.933
Well, I can carry a tune.

25:55.968 --> 25:57.215
You're not bad yourself.

25:57.250 --> 25:58.733
Well, I'm not so good on my

25:58.768 --> 26:00.393
Own, but we make a nice duet.

26:00.428 --> 26:02.522
Yeah, that we do, huh?

26:02.557 --> 26:04.582
I'll just grab my keys.

26:04.617 --> 26:06.567
Look, I w--I wanna thank you

26:06.602 --> 26:08.909
For everything, and, uh, I'm not

26:08.944 --> 26:11.217
Used to letting the lady pay.

26:11.252 --> 26:12.668
Call me old-Fashioned.

26:12.703 --> 26:14.126
Heh. Old-Fashioned.

26:14.161 --> 26:15.550
Ah. Heh heh heh.

26:16.851 --> 26:18.067
It's nice to see you laugh.

26:18.102 --> 26:19.243
I mean, you've been working so

26:19.278 --> 26:20.698
Hard. You've got so much on your

26:20.733 --> 26:22.091
Mind. Sometimes you have to put

26:22.126 --> 26:23.450
The load down and have a good

26:23.485 --> 26:24.415
Laugh.

26:24.450 --> 26:25.816
<i>Ah, your rendition of purple</i>

26:25.851 --> 26:27.183
<i>Rain certainly helped that</i>

26:27.218 --> 26:28.016
Along.

26:28.051 --> 26:28.949
You're awful.

26:28.984 --> 26:30.900
And you are amazing.

26:30.935 --> 26:32.782
Look, uh, I know I'm

26:32.817 --> 26:34.633
Old-Fashioned, but we've been

26:34.668 --> 26:36.975
Circling around each other for

26:37.010 --> 26:39.283
A couple months now. Will you

26:39.318 --> 26:42.716
Spend the night?

26:42.751 --> 26:45.884
I'll have to think about it.

26:55.917 --> 27:00.784
Oh. Shit. Ow.

27:00.819 --> 27:01.415
Hey--

27:01.450 --> 27:02.148
Take your time.

27:02.183 --> 27:03.633
Oh. It--It wasn't what--

27:03.668 --> 27:04.792
I didn't see anything,

27:04.827 --> 27:05.872
All right? All I'm saying is

27:05.907 --> 27:06.862
You're gonna violate yourself

27:06.897 --> 27:08.190
Like that, lock the door.

27:08.225 --> 27:09.538
You--OK, I--First of all,

27:09.573 --> 27:10.945
I would--One place I would never

27:10.980 --> 27:12.317
Jerk off is in the bathroom.

27:12.352 --> 27:13.016
OK, I think--

27:13.051 --> 27:13.949
OK? I was performing

27:13.984 --> 27:15.751
A medical procedure on myself.

27:15.786 --> 27:16.616
Oh, really?

27:16.651 --> 27:17.450
I was checking my cock.

27:17.485 --> 27:18.384
You know, that's the lamest

27:18.419 --> 27:19.434
Euphemism I've ever heard.

27:19.469 --> 27:21.126
It's not a euphemism, OK?

27:21.161 --> 27:23.039
There's a very slight, ahem,

27:23.074 --> 27:24.882
Slim, miniscule, really,

27:24.917 --> 27:26.851
Chance that I might have, uh,

27:26.886 --> 27:27.916
Chlamydia.

27:27.951 --> 27:28.882
Heh heh heh heh.

27:28.917 --> 27:29.934
No, I'm--I'm dead serious,

27:29.969 --> 27:30.993
Lou. I--I haven't taken a piss

27:31.028 --> 27:31.983
In 24 hours. I'm afraid to,

27:32.018 --> 27:34.150
You know, pull it out in case...

27:34.185 --> 27:34.784
flames shoot out of it?

27:34.819 --> 27:36.449
Yes! Yes, OK?

27:36.484 --> 27:37.217
You wanna tell me how this

27:37.252 --> 27:38.248
Happened?

27:38.283 --> 27:39.716
All right, um, you know

27:39.751 --> 27:42.450
Damian's, um, teacher, the one--

27:42.485 --> 27:43.315
Yeah, the hottie.

27:43.350 --> 27:45.367
Yeah. She, uh--All right,

27:45.402 --> 27:47.076
So she was supposedly raping,

27:47.111 --> 27:48.514
You know, some of her students,

27:48.549 --> 27:49.917
And Damian was one of the kids

27:49.952 --> 27:51.415
She was, uh, you know,

27:51.450 --> 27:53.167
Having sex with, and anyways,

27:53.202 --> 27:54.643
Long story short, I--I go,

27:54.678 --> 27:55.947
And I talk to her about the

27:55.982 --> 27:57.366
Situation, blah, blah, blah,

27:57.401 --> 27:58.726
And you know, next thing I know,

27:58.761 --> 27:59.972
Bing, bang, boom, she wants me

28:00.007 --> 28:01.762
To have sex with her so she'll

28:01.797 --> 28:03.473
Stop having sex with Damian,

28:03.508 --> 28:04.779
Which she did, by the way, and--

28:04.814 --> 28:05.899
And I had sex with her, and it

28:05.934 --> 28:06.942
Was like I was Damian. It was

28:06.977 --> 28:08.314
Like I was 15. I--I couldn't

28:08.349 --> 28:10.550
Hold back. I was coming like in

28:10.585 --> 28:12.351
5 seconds. Anyways, uh, I think

28:12.386 --> 28:14.118
She might have given me the,

28:14.153 --> 28:15.682
Uh--The big "c."

28:15.717 --> 28:16.951
Cancer's big "c." Chlamydia--

28:16.986 --> 28:17.849
Little "c."

28:17.884 --> 28:19.550
Oh. Well, you know what I'm

28:19.585 --> 28:21.217
Saying, so what do you think?

28:21.252 --> 28:21.983
Hey, I don't know.

28:22.018 --> 28:22.867
We're talkin' about piss-Filled

28:22.902 --> 28:24.059
Bladders. We're talkin' about

28:24.094 --> 28:25.217
Illicit underage sex scandals

28:25.252 --> 28:26.315
With teachers and...

28:26.350 --> 28:27.684
which I put an end to,

28:27.719 --> 28:28.215
By the way.

28:28.250 --> 28:28.983
Students and uncles and

28:29.018 --> 28:29.901
Nephews. We're talkin' about

28:29.936 --> 28:31.059
Fire-Breathing cocks. I mean--

28:31.094 --> 28:32.172
Heh heh. Be honest with you, all

28:32.207 --> 28:33.412
Of a sudden--I don't know why,

28:33.447 --> 28:34.582
But you know, I feel a little

28:34.617 --> 28:35.700
Bit better about my life.

28:35.735 --> 28:36.784
Oh. Well, I'm--I'm glad

28:36.819 --> 28:37.382
I could help you out.

28:37.417 --> 28:38.184
Well, Tommy, I don't know

28:38.219 --> 28:38.935
What to tell you. I mean, you're

28:38.970 --> 28:40.027
The only man in the tri-State

28:40.062 --> 28:41.049
Area who shares a case of

28:41.084 --> 28:43.051
Chlamydia with 3 teenage boys.

28:43.086 --> 28:46.215
Nonclergy, of course.

28:46.250 --> 28:47.851
And the 3-0 pitch coming down

28:47.886 --> 28:49.582
From...

28:49.617 --> 28:51.784
oh! Dude, it's all knotted up

28:51.819 --> 28:52.716
In the bottom of the ninth.

28:52.751 --> 28:53.517
How long is it gonna take you to

28:53.552 --> 28:54.148
Fill that thing out?

28:54.183 --> 28:55.766
Yeah, I'm just tryin' to make

28:55.801 --> 28:57.276
Sure I got everything right.

28:57.311 --> 28:58.751
Thousand-Mile journey begins

28:58.786 --> 28:59.916
With one step.

28:59.951 --> 29:01.467
You know, I'm sick of that

29:01.502 --> 29:02.709
Philosophy shit. Why does it

29:02.744 --> 29:04.047
Always feel like somebody's

29:04.082 --> 29:05.466
Tellin' me what I should do?

29:05.501 --> 29:06.851
Well, what do you wanna do,

29:06.886 --> 29:07.716
Mike?

29:07.751 --> 29:09.084
I wanna stay in my firehouse,

29:09.119 --> 29:10.417
You know. I wanna be one of the

29:10.452 --> 29:11.415
Guys again.

29:11.450 --> 29:12.417
Who are you gonna be besides

29:12.452 --> 29:13.282
Yourself?

29:13.317 --> 29:14.217
Will you cut it out with that

29:14.252 --> 29:17.882
Faggot-Ass philosophy?

29:17.917 --> 29:18.984
Who are you callin' a faggot,

29:19.019 --> 29:19.751
Faggot?

29:19.786 --> 29:20.449
You.

29:20.484 --> 29:21.415
No, you're the faggot.

29:21.450 --> 29:23.117
Yeah, OK, Mr. Gay faggot guy

29:23.152 --> 29:24.784
Standin' out on his construction

29:24.819 --> 29:25.784
Site in his tight little

29:25.819 --> 29:26.549
Blue jeans.

29:26.584 --> 29:27.883
Well, look who's talkin',

29:27.918 --> 29:29.251
Mr. Firefighter in your turnout

29:29.286 --> 29:30.584
Gear, lookin' like a lost member

29:30.619 --> 29:31.684
Of the village people.

29:31.719 --> 29:32.582
Kiss my ass.

29:32.617 --> 29:33.717
Oh, well, that sounds like

29:33.752 --> 29:34.817
Something a faggot might say,

29:34.852 --> 29:35.784
Faggot.

29:37.217 --> 29:38.183
He got it off, bro.

29:38.218 --> 29:38.734
He got it.

29:38.769 --> 29:39.215
It's gone.

29:39.250 --> 29:42.018
Going. Gone, baby! Gone!

29:42.053 --> 29:43.182
Unh! Yeah!

29:43.217 --> 29:45.084
Yeah! Dude, you want a beer?

29:45.119 --> 29:45.782
Yeah. Yeah.

29:45.817 --> 29:46.617
Yeah, all right.

29:46.652 --> 29:48.215
Nice, bro.

29:48.250 --> 29:50.183
...as he touches 'em all.

29:52.018 --> 29:52.550
Tommy!

29:52.585 --> 29:54.248
Yeah.

29:54.283 --> 29:55.350
Open--Open the door.

29:55.385 --> 29:56.248
I'm coming.

29:56.283 --> 29:59.617
Open the goddamn door, Tommy.

29:59.652 --> 30:00.616
Hey. What's up?

30:00.651 --> 30:01.784
Yeah. You happy? I never

30:01.819 --> 30:02.851
Thought you, of all people,

30:02.886 --> 30:03.849
Would sabotage the least

30:03.884 --> 30:05.084
Dysfunctional relationship in my

30:05.119 --> 30:06.949
Entire life.

30:06.984 --> 30:08.434
S-Sabotage? You're the one

30:08.469 --> 30:09.884
Who's going out with, like,

30:09.919 --> 30:10.949
6 different guys.

30:10.984 --> 30:12.484
No, 5, and I like Sean the

30:12.519 --> 30:13.984
Best. He happens to be very

30:14.019 --> 30:15.115
Nice, and he did--Does

30:15.150 --> 30:16.517
Everything I say. He's perfect.

30:16.552 --> 30:17.217
Then why--Why are you

30:17.252 --> 30:18.282
Cheating on him?

30:18.317 --> 30:19.851
A zebra can't change his

30:19.886 --> 30:20.916
Stripes overnight.

30:20.951 --> 30:24.467
Oh. Well, whatever. Are you--

30:24.502 --> 30:26.693
You lookin' for a cup? There.

30:26.728 --> 30:28.884
Wait. What is the matter

30:28.919 --> 30:29.618
With you?

30:29.653 --> 30:30.282
Nothing.

30:30.317 --> 30:31.051
What do you have, the crabs?

30:31.086 --> 30:33.016
No.

30:33.051 --> 30:34.917
You know, see what it says?

30:34.952 --> 30:35.515
Yeah.

30:35.550 --> 30:36.417
Yeah. Well, looks like it's

30:36.452 --> 30:37.115
Half-Drunk.

30:37.150 --> 30:37.882
It's half-Full.

30:37.917 --> 30:38.782
No, it's half-Empty,

30:38.817 --> 30:39.917
And I know pops didn't do this.

30:39.952 --> 30:40.549
He knows better.

30:40.584 --> 30:42.334
Lou, OK? Lou had--Is having

30:42.369 --> 30:44.110
A rough time. He had a couple of

30:44.145 --> 30:45.464
Drinks. That's all. Here you go.

30:45.499 --> 30:46.608
Yeah, well, I'll deal with

30:46.643 --> 30:47.847
That doughboy later. What did

30:47.882 --> 30:49.749
You tell Sean about fred, huh?

30:49.784 --> 30:51.617
I--I told him the truth, OK,

30:51.652 --> 30:52.851
That he committed suicide

30:52.886 --> 30:54.051
Because his dog died.

30:54.086 --> 30:54.816
Lies.

30:54.851 --> 30:55.884
That's what happened, mags,

30:55.919 --> 30:56.882
OK? The guy had a chemical

30:56.917 --> 30:57.851
Imbalance. Probably why you two

30:57.886 --> 30:59.083
Got along so well.

30:59.118 --> 31:00.467
Listen, Tommy--What's the

31:00.502 --> 31:01.676
Matter with you? You got--

31:01.711 --> 31:03.247
Nothing. Nothing. I have to

31:03.282 --> 31:04.449
Go to the bathroom. That's all.

31:04.484 --> 31:05.817
Listen, Tommy, if you don't

31:05.852 --> 31:07.118
Get your big pointy snout out of

31:07.153 --> 31:08.318
My affairs, I'm gonna make what

31:08.353 --> 31:09.484
You did to Johnny look like

31:09.519 --> 31:11.051
A game of patty-Cake.

31:11.086 --> 31:11.482
OK.

31:11.517 --> 31:12.867
You get me, Tommy?

31:12.902 --> 31:14.217
I gotcha. Gotcha.

31:14.252 --> 31:17.115
Snout?

31:17.150 --> 31:18.067
Take your eyes off my ass.

31:18.102 --> 31:19.259
I can tell you're lookin' at my

31:19.294 --> 31:20.439
Ass, and I'm your sister, Tommy.

31:20.474 --> 31:21.584
I was looking at your belt.

31:21.619 --> 31:22.668
It's a nice belt.

31:22.703 --> 31:23.682
Yeah, sure.

31:23.717 --> 31:25.651
Nice--Nice talkin' to ya.

31:28.384 --> 31:30.434
Ohh.

31:30.469 --> 31:32.484
Ahh.

31:33.517 --> 31:37.433
Ahh. Oh, my God.

31:37.468 --> 31:41.350
Ohh. Ahh. Ahh.

31:41.385 --> 31:43.415
Whoo!

31:43.450 --> 31:45.550
Ohh. My...

31:46.584 --> 31:48.450
ohh.

31:55.284 --> 31:57.049
That her?

31:57.084 --> 31:59.284
Yep. Great face. Great rack.

31:59.319 --> 32:00.885
Hey, hey, hey. Watch it, pal.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.451
You could be talking about my

32:02.486 --> 32:04.068
Future wife.

32:04.103 --> 32:05.615
Gotcha.

32:05.650 --> 32:07.017
Now tell me again, just so

32:07.052 --> 32:08.384
I'm clear, I marry her, I get to

32:08.419 --> 32:09.615
Have conjugal visits?

32:09.650 --> 32:11.100
Once every 10 days for an

32:11.135 --> 32:12.526
Hour at a time on prison grounds

32:12.561 --> 32:13.917
In a trailer with phone contact

32:13.952 --> 32:15.249
Every 10 minutes.

32:15.284 --> 32:17.850
Not bad. I mean, so I bang

32:17.885 --> 32:20.417
Her, she starts talkin' a blue

32:20.452 --> 32:21.748
Streak, I can always make

32:21.783 --> 32:22.766
Believe that one of those calls

32:22.801 --> 32:23.750
Means it's time for me to go

32:23.785 --> 32:25.034
Back to my cell, right?

32:25.069 --> 32:26.293
Happens all the time.

32:26.328 --> 32:27.518
Perfect. You got any

32:27.553 --> 32:29.384
Breath spray?

32:31.084 --> 32:33.984
Yep. Here.

32:43.717 --> 32:45.551
All right, all right.

32:50.683 --> 32:52.316
Bud, I, uh--Jeez, I never

32:52.351 --> 32:53.915
Thought I'd--I'd see you.

32:53.950 --> 32:55.184
It's gonna be a lot easier if

32:55.219 --> 32:56.934
You just let me talk.

32:56.969 --> 32:58.615
Sure. Go ahead.

32:58.650 --> 32:59.933
I tried to keep Jeannie from

32:59.968 --> 33:01.217
Marrying you, because I thought

33:01.252 --> 33:03.435
You were a piece of shit,

33:03.470 --> 33:05.210
But when I told her I would

33:05.245 --> 33:07.131
Never see her or speak to her

33:07.166 --> 33:08.982
Again, she called my bluff.

33:09.017 --> 33:11.683
Not a day goes by I don't regret

33:11.718 --> 33:14.249
That threat.

33:14.284 --> 33:16.351
Hey, look, you, uh--You had

33:16.386 --> 33:18.049
Your reasons.

33:18.084 --> 33:20.433
My wife says that, uh, you

33:20.468 --> 33:22.783
Asking me for help, that showed

33:22.818 --> 33:25.101
Character. I don't know if

33:25.136 --> 33:27.226
I agree with that, but look,

33:27.261 --> 33:29.839
I admire your commitment to my

33:29.874 --> 33:32.417
Little sister. You stuck with

33:32.452 --> 33:37.015
Her through all this.

33:37.050 --> 33:39.017
It's 5 grand. It should help

33:39.052 --> 33:40.934
You, uh, till you get your

33:40.969 --> 33:42.817
Finances in order. Just don't

33:42.852 --> 33:45.249
Spend it on the ponies.

33:45.284 --> 33:49.634
I would never do that, bud.

33:49.669 --> 33:52.743
Jerry. Is everything OK?

33:52.778 --> 33:55.817
Look, it's not what you

33:55.852 --> 33:56.682
Think, bud.

33:56.717 --> 33:58.467
What I think? What I think is

33:58.502 --> 34:00.543
That's the most expensive piece

34:00.578 --> 34:02.584
Of ass you ever had, my friend.

34:02.619 --> 34:05.284
Have a nice life.

34:10.484 --> 34:12.717
How you doing, gorgeous?

34:12.752 --> 34:14.784
Oh, my God. You look nothing

34:14.819 --> 34:16.801
Like the picture you sent me.

34:16.835 --> 34:18.793
Oh. Yeah. I lost a hundred

34:18.828 --> 34:20.750
Pounds. I'm on the murder-One

34:20.784 --> 34:21.614
Diet.

34:21.650 --> 34:22.416
Ha ha ha.

34:22.451 --> 34:24.083
But you, you look great in

34:24.119 --> 34:25.717
The picture you sent me, but you

34:25.752 --> 34:27.801
Look even better in person.

34:27.835 --> 34:29.815
Aw, thanks. Oh, my God.

34:29.850 --> 34:31.717
I love your lips. I wish I could

34:31.752 --> 34:32.949
Taste them.

34:32.984 --> 34:34.783
Well, you certainly don't

34:34.818 --> 34:35.715
Waste any time.

34:35.750 --> 34:37.350
Ah, no. Life's too short.

34:37.385 --> 34:38.915
I learned that last year.

34:38.949 --> 34:40.300
My mother, she dropped dead in

34:40.335 --> 34:41.650
Front of me in the kitchen

34:41.685 --> 34:42.715
Making tea.

34:42.750 --> 34:43.915
Oh, my God. How old?

34:43.949 --> 34:45.783
86. Healthy as a horse, too.

34:45.818 --> 34:47.349
Go figure. You never know.

34:47.384 --> 34:49.317
Nah, you don't. I'll probably

34:49.351 --> 34:51.168
Die behind bars. But you know

34:51.203 --> 34:53.010
What? I had to go back in time,

34:53.045 --> 34:54.817
I'd shoot that prick all over

34:54.851 --> 34:55.648
Again.

34:55.683 --> 34:58.984
Hey, I think what you did is

34:59.019 --> 35:00.934
What needed to be done.

35:00.969 --> 35:03.093
All these goddamn faggoty,

35:03.128 --> 35:05.339
Politically correct assholes

35:05.374 --> 35:07.462
With their goddamn bibles and

35:07.497 --> 35:09.273
Their bumper stickers and their

35:09.308 --> 35:11.096
Girl power bullshit. Nobody's

35:11.131 --> 35:12.874
Accountable anymore. You get

35:12.909 --> 35:14.246
A drunk driver who kills a kid,

35:14.281 --> 35:15.582
It's not his fault 'cause he

35:15.617 --> 35:16.817
Drank. It's his parents' fault

35:16.852 --> 35:18.017
Because they bullied him when he

35:18.052 --> 35:20.084
Was a kid. I am so sick of

35:20.119 --> 35:22.118
People not facing up to the

35:22.153 --> 35:24.268
Facts. Black people like fried

35:24.303 --> 35:26.493
Foods. Chinese people--Lousy

35:26.528 --> 35:28.706
Goddamn drivers. Mexicans think

35:28.741 --> 35:31.312
A pickup truck holds 27 people.

35:31.347 --> 35:33.884
And that's just what I think.

35:36.217 --> 35:37.949
Will you marry me?

35:37.984 --> 35:41.184
Tommy. Alicia. I'm looking

35:41.219 --> 35:44.249
For Franco.

35:44.284 --> 35:47.284
He, uh, took the day off

35:47.319 --> 35:49.351
Trying to find his daughter.

35:49.386 --> 35:51.068
And I have a brother who's

35:51.103 --> 35:52.510
A cop, so I drop a dime,

35:52.545 --> 35:53.917
Somebody's in a shitload of

35:53.952 --> 35:54.849
Trouble.

35:54.884 --> 35:56.783
Well, you must not be fully

35:56.818 --> 35:58.867
Aware of the situation, or you'd

35:58.902 --> 36:00.917
Know that that somebody would

36:00.952 --> 36:02.849
Not be me.

36:02.884 --> 36:05.151
Yeah. You know how much, um,

36:05.186 --> 36:07.615
He loves her?

36:07.650 --> 36:09.416
How much she loves him?

36:09.451 --> 36:11.151
Oh, do you? Have you spoken

36:11.186 --> 36:12.516
With her? I mean, or more

36:12.551 --> 36:14.317
Importantly, have you listened

36:14.352 --> 36:16.284
To her? Because I actually have,

36:16.319 --> 36:18.217
And she's--She's frightened.

36:18.252 --> 36:19.549
Of her own dad?

36:19.584 --> 36:21.183
Yeah, in a way, she is. I

36:21.218 --> 36:22.884
Mean, she loves him, he's sweet,

36:22.919 --> 36:24.418
But she's looking for a mommy,

36:24.453 --> 36:25.802
And you know, lucky her, they

36:25.837 --> 36:27.060
Just keep on trooping through

36:27.095 --> 36:28.273
The front door. Every time he

36:28.308 --> 36:29.913
Dates somebody for more than,

36:29.948 --> 36:31.766
I don't know, what, a week, she

36:31.801 --> 36:34.409
Gets a new mom. Look, the point

36:34.444 --> 36:37.580
Is in her daddy's house, girls

36:37.615 --> 36:40.716
Are things that disappear. She's

36:40.751 --> 36:43.817
A girl, and she's wondering when

36:43.852 --> 36:45.648
Her time is gonna come.

36:45.683 --> 36:47.384
Uh, I don't care what you

36:47.419 --> 36:48.416
Say. There's no way--

36:48.451 --> 36:50.050
Look, do you have a daughter?

36:50.085 --> 36:51.049
I have 2 daughters.

36:51.084 --> 36:52.217
Oh, good. Well, then you

36:52.252 --> 36:53.501
Probably heard this before,

36:53.536 --> 36:55.126
Although it happens to be true.

36:55.161 --> 36:56.682
You know the first man that

36:56.717 --> 36:58.017
A little girl falls in love with

36:58.052 --> 36:59.850
Is her daddy.

36:59.885 --> 37:00.416
Yeah.

37:00.451 --> 37:01.534
And so then when she gets

37:01.569 --> 37:02.583
Older and she wants to get

37:02.618 --> 37:03.951
Married, chances are that she's

37:03.986 --> 37:05.284
Gonna pick somebody just like

37:05.319 --> 37:05.782
Her old man.

37:05.817 --> 37:06.667
Yeah, I'm aware of this

37:06.702 --> 37:07.518
Theory, and it's a bunch of

37:07.553 --> 37:08.282
Bullshit.

37:08.317 --> 37:09.450
Oh. So you don't have

37:09.485 --> 37:10.584
Anything in common with your

37:10.619 --> 37:11.917
Wife's father.

37:11.952 --> 37:12.817
No.

37:12.852 --> 37:13.648
Oh.

37:13.683 --> 37:14.417
Nothing.

37:14.452 --> 37:15.116
Nothing.

37:15.151 --> 37:16.967
No. He--He was a--He was in

37:17.002 --> 37:18.543
Real estate, first of all, so he

37:18.578 --> 37:20.031
Was a suit-And-Tie guy. He spent

37:20.066 --> 37:21.191
His whole life behind a desk,

37:21.226 --> 37:22.438
And real estate was all he

37:22.473 --> 37:23.595
Thought about. He got up every

37:23.630 --> 37:24.823
Morning and thought about how to

37:24.858 --> 37:26.537
Rip people off, OK? He was a

37:26.572 --> 37:29.095
Selfish, self-Centered, greedy,

37:29.130 --> 37:31.007
Lying, cheating midget. He was,

37:31.042 --> 37:32.884
Like, 5'2". I'm way taller than

37:32.919 --> 37:34.518
Him. And not funny at all,

37:34.553 --> 37:36.002
Which is one of things my wife

37:36.037 --> 37:37.260
Said she found attractive about

37:37.295 --> 37:38.723
Me when she met me was that I

37:38.758 --> 37:41.220
Was funny. Her father was not

37:41.255 --> 37:43.069
Funny. And why we're talking

37:43.104 --> 37:44.577
About me, I have no idea.

37:44.612 --> 37:45.998
This is about Franco.

37:46.033 --> 37:47.349
You like Franco?

37:47.384 --> 37:49.284
Yeah. He's like one of my

37:49.319 --> 37:49.882
Best friends.

37:49.917 --> 37:50.783
So you wouldn't mind if one

37:50.818 --> 37:51.650
Of your daughters wanted to

37:51.685 --> 37:52.748
Marry him.

37:52.783 --> 37:53.750
That wouldn't--How would that

37:53.785 --> 37:54.717
Happen? They're way too young

37:54.752 --> 37:55.549
For him.

37:55.584 --> 37:56.351
I don't know, when they get

37:56.386 --> 37:59.982
Older.

38:00.017 --> 38:01.333
OK. Well, then why don't you

38:01.368 --> 38:02.626
Have him call me, and we'll set

38:02.661 --> 38:03.922
Up a time where he can spend

38:03.957 --> 38:05.204
Some time with his daughter

38:05.239 --> 38:06.428
And--But tell him to call me

38:06.463 --> 38:07.756
After 5:00, 'cause I'm taking

38:07.791 --> 38:09.050
Her to the dentist. She's never

38:09.085 --> 38:10.782
Been. By the way, I'm not

38:10.817 --> 38:12.200
Expecting him to change. I just

38:12.235 --> 38:13.584
Want him to learn a few things

38:13.619 --> 38:14.151
For her--

38:14.186 --> 38:14.648
I gotcha.

38:14.683 --> 38:16.484
OK. That's good. Your wife's

38:16.519 --> 38:21.750
Right. You're a riot.

38:40.650 --> 38:41.850
You know, quit starting

38:41.885 --> 38:42.951
At me, OK?

38:42.986 --> 38:43.982
What?

38:44.017 --> 38:44.750
You're starin' at me.

38:44.785 --> 38:45.815
Just knock it off.

38:45.850 --> 38:46.850
I'm not starin' at you. I--

38:46.885 --> 38:47.767
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

38:47.802 --> 38:48.759
I was lookin' out the win--

38:48.794 --> 38:49.656
One window and the other window.

38:49.691 --> 38:50.587
I happened to look at you in

38:50.622 --> 38:51.484
Between. It's called glancing.

38:51.519 --> 38:52.251
Yeah. Well, glance at

38:52.286 --> 38:53.201
Somebody else.

38:53.236 --> 38:54.082
OK. Whatever.

38:54.117 --> 38:54.983
When you glance at somebody,

38:55.018 --> 38:56.051
It's like they're like beside

38:56.086 --> 38:57.302
You or like at a distance from

38:57.337 --> 38:58.518
You, OK? You were blatantly

38:58.553 --> 38:59.082
Staring.

38:59.117 --> 39:00.517
I don't need you to define

39:00.552 --> 39:01.784
Glancing for me, OK, asshole?

39:01.819 --> 39:03.017
Yeah. I'm an asshole now.

39:03.052 --> 39:03.648
Yep.

39:03.683 --> 39:04.282
Why am I an asshole?

39:04.317 --> 39:05.367
You're an asshole because you

39:05.402 --> 39:06.417
Told Maggie everything I told

39:06.452 --> 39:07.549
You about fred.

39:07.584 --> 39:08.551
OK, well, so I'm a pussy if

39:08.586 --> 39:09.684
I don't say anything to Maggie.

39:09.719 --> 39:10.734
Now--And now I'm an asshole for

39:10.769 --> 39:11.643
Opening my big mouth. You know

39:11.678 --> 39:12.518
What? You're impossible to

39:12.553 --> 39:13.049
Please.

39:13.084 --> 39:13.682
Yeah. You know what?

39:13.717 --> 39:16.300
You wanna please me? Keep your

39:16.335 --> 39:18.884
Hands out of my sister's pants.

39:18.919 --> 39:19.549
Guys.

39:19.584 --> 39:20.884
Hey. Ladies, enough.

39:20.919 --> 39:22.184
Ooh, you can't get me.

39:22.219 --> 39:23.385
All right.

39:23.420 --> 39:24.516
Ooh hoo hoo!

39:24.551 --> 39:25.300
She's the best thing that

39:25.335 --> 39:26.050
Ever happened to me, and you

39:26.085 --> 39:26.748
Ruined it.

39:26.783 --> 39:27.983
I told you to talk to her,

39:28.018 --> 39:29.184
OK? You decided to break up with

39:29.219 --> 39:30.151
Her. You live with that

39:30.186 --> 39:30.782
Decision.

39:30.817 --> 39:31.817
Yeah. Well, you know what?

39:31.852 --> 39:32.817
Try this one out. I don't wanna

39:32.852 --> 39:34.984
Be friends anymore.

39:35.019 --> 39:35.815
Yeah. And?

39:35.850 --> 39:36.950
I--I don't want you to call

39:36.985 --> 39:37.901
Me. It's over.

39:37.936 --> 39:38.782
We're breaking up.

39:38.817 --> 39:39.717
You're--You're breaking--

39:39.752 --> 39:40.316
Yes.

39:40.351 --> 39:41.334
Hey, you guys listening to

39:41.369 --> 39:42.317
This? Garrity's breaking up

39:42.352 --> 39:43.249
With me. Huh?

39:43.284 --> 39:44.350
Yeah. It's over. I don't want

39:44.385 --> 39:45.551
To hear from you. I don't want

39:45.586 --> 39:46.568
No dinner, no hanging out...

39:46.603 --> 39:47.551
he's breaking up with me.

39:47.586 --> 39:48.182
Nothing.

39:48.217 --> 39:50.400
Unbelievable. Oh, my God.

39:50.435 --> 39:52.584
Your whole generation--Gay.

39:52.619 --> 39:53.282
Here we go with the

39:53.317 --> 39:54.267
Generational thing again. Well,

39:54.302 --> 39:55.217
Excuse me for not seeing a movie

39:55.252 --> 39:56.049
That was made in, like,

39:56.084 --> 39:57.850
1970-Blah, blah, blah, OK? I was

39:57.885 --> 40:00.251
Like a fetus.

40:05.551 --> 40:07.184
Got here as fast as I could.

40:07.219 --> 40:08.018
Tell me, what'd she say?

40:08.053 --> 40:08.768
Hey, take--Take it easy.

40:08.803 --> 40:09.560
What was so important you

40:09.595 --> 40:10.317
Couldn't tell me over the phone?

40:10.352 --> 40:11.017
What did she say, Tommy?

40:11.052 --> 40:11.683
It's my goddamn little girl,

40:11.718 --> 40:12.982
Tommy! It's my kid!

40:13.017 --> 40:14.251
OK, calm down. Calm down.

40:14.286 --> 40:17.015
It's OK, guys.

40:17.050 --> 40:19.551
Sh-She said a lot of things.

40:19.586 --> 40:23.449
Um...

40:23.484 --> 40:26.434
one of which is that, um, little

40:26.469 --> 40:29.010
Girls grow up to marry men who

40:29.045 --> 40:31.551
Are a lot like their dads, and

40:31.586 --> 40:33.949
I didn't think she was

40:33.984 --> 40:36.717
Necessarily talking about, ahem,

40:36.752 --> 40:39.549
Looks, you know?

40:39.584 --> 40:40.384
Yeah. Well, shit, I never

40:40.419 --> 40:42.451
Thought about that.

40:42.486 --> 40:44.449
Yeah. Me neither.

40:44.484 --> 40:46.734
Guess that's a goddamn

40:46.769 --> 40:49.259
Terrifying prospect, huh?

40:49.294 --> 40:50.922
So what's the problem, right?

40:50.957 --> 40:53.070
Not like I'm gonna win any

40:53.105 --> 40:55.149
Father of the year awards.

40:55.184 --> 40:56.684
My baby's gonna grow up wanting

40:56.719 --> 40:58.418
For nothing. I get my life back

40:58.453 --> 41:00.485
The way it was before, huh?

41:00.520 --> 41:02.518
It's good for everybody, right?

41:02.553 --> 41:04.217
Franco.

41:13.584 --> 41:15.917
Sorry for grabbin' ya.

41:21.484 --> 41:22.783

Hey. What's going on?

41:33.452 --> 41:34.784
I'm in.

41:34.819 --> 41:36.082
You're in?

41:36.117 --> 41:37.383
Yeah, what we talked about at

41:37.418 --> 41:39.317
The bar, messing with Johnny and

41:39.352 --> 41:41.101
Janet. I think it'll be fun.

41:41.136 --> 41:42.593
Yeah, it'll be a blast.

41:42.628 --> 41:44.050
So how do you want it to go

41:44.085 --> 41:45.116
Down exactly?

41:45.151 --> 41:46.151
Well, why don't you give me

41:46.186 --> 41:47.301
A couple of days to think about

41:47.336 --> 41:48.417
It, and, uh--And then I'll call

41:48.452 --> 41:49.451
You back with the plan.

41:49.486 --> 41:51.584
