02:06.251 --> 02:07.419
Matt?

02:07.453 --> 02:08.287
Wake up.

02:10.288 --> 02:12.224
My door, it won't open.

02:13.426 --> 02:14.259
Matt, wake up.

02:16.663 --> 02:17.697
What?

02:17.730 --> 02:18.531
What are you doing?

02:18.565 --> 02:19.398
My door won't open.

02:21.333 --> 02:22.669
Try to get your door open.

02:24.804 --> 02:27.974
Okay, okay.

02:34.079 --> 02:35.247
Okay, hold on.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.361
What're you doing?

02:50.697 --> 02:51.531
Get it going.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.068
I think we're snowed under.

02:55.100 --> 02:56.436
It's just some ice.

02:56.469 --> 02:58.004
If it were just ice, there
would be some visibility,

02:58.037 --> 02:59.171
wouldn't there be?

02:59.204 --> 03:00.238
Well, at least we'll
get the engine going

03:00.272 --> 03:01.774
and it'll help warm us up and,

03:02.775 --> 03:04.010
and loosen the snow.

03:11.283 --> 03:12.452
You're gonna flood it.

03:12.485 --> 03:13.853
There's nothing to flood.

03:19.559 --> 03:21.193
Shit.

03:21.226 --> 03:22.327
Shit!

03:22.361 --> 03:23.763
Okay, don't worry,
Shit!

03:23.796 --> 03:24.631
don't worry.

03:27.299 --> 03:29.401
Breathe, it's okay.

03:31.871 --> 03:33.305
Got a shot through the back.

03:47.654 --> 03:48.488
Matt.

03:51.557 --> 03:53.358
Shit!
Matt.

03:53.392 --> 03:54.827
Just don't worry.

04:18.618 --> 04:20.019
Ah shit.

04:20.053 --> 04:21.353
Matt?
Can you just give me

04:21.386 --> 04:22.722
one second, please?

04:27.093 --> 04:28.393
I'm sorry, baby,

04:28.428 --> 04:29.529
I'm just trying to get my
head around this, okay?

04:29.562 --> 04:31.831
I knew we should've
kept on driving.

04:31.864 --> 04:33.331
I knew it, I said it!

04:33.365 --> 04:34.967
Okay, can we calm down, please?

04:36.201 --> 04:37.202
We should've kept on driving

04:37.235 --> 04:38.938
at least another hour or two

04:38.971 --> 04:41.107
to get to a village
or something.

04:41.140 --> 04:44.177
It was freezing rain, in
the middle of the night,

04:44.242 --> 04:45.578
should we have kept going?

04:49.749 --> 04:50.650
We're so fucked.

04:51.651 --> 04:53.318
Can you not be so defeatist?

04:58.323 --> 04:59.625
What're you doing?

04:59.659 --> 05:00.626
Getting my phone.

05:04.063 --> 05:04.897
Come on.

05:08.835 --> 05:09.669
Shit.

05:11.336 --> 05:12.939
The battery is at half life.

05:12.972 --> 05:14.073
Let me see.
Wait.

05:20.747 --> 05:22.782
Come on, come on.

05:22.815 --> 05:24.249
Matt, give me the phone.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.317
Hold on one minute.

05:28.420 --> 05:29.989
Matt, just give me the phone.

05:31.824 --> 05:32.992
Matt!

05:33.025 --> 05:34.427
We need to save the battery.

05:38.030 --> 05:39.331
Can we please not argue?

05:40.332 --> 05:41.534
Okay, I'm sorry.

05:43.136 --> 05:44.336
I just need a few minutes

05:44.369 --> 05:46.205
and I will get us
out of this, okay?

05:49.976 --> 05:50.810
Okay.

05:54.046 --> 05:55.848
Let's see where we are.

06:01.554 --> 06:02.722
What food do we have?

06:09.128 --> 06:11.396
Chicken, cheese, and
a herring sandwich.

06:16.636 --> 06:18.905
Here we go, here we go.

06:19.839 --> 06:23.341
Okay.

06:25.144 --> 06:25.978
All right.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.649
All right, we're on this road

06:29.682 --> 06:32.819
and we're somewhere between
here and here, okay?

06:33.886 --> 06:36.489
Someone is going to pass by.

06:36.522 --> 06:38.224
Can we please not panic?

06:38.257 --> 06:39.357
Hmm.

06:39.391 --> 06:40.226
Okay.

06:41.260 --> 06:42.662
Never know when ice is tight.

06:46.098 --> 06:46.966
What?
Shit.

06:46.999 --> 06:48.901
What's wrong?
My back.

06:48.935 --> 06:49.769
Oh shit.

06:52.171 --> 06:52.972
Okay, you know what?

06:53.005 --> 06:54.006
Come back here.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.007
There's more space.

06:56.843 --> 07:00.246
Come on, come on.

07:00.279 --> 07:02.715
Okay.

07:02.748 --> 07:03.583
Okay.

07:05.685 --> 07:06.519
Okay.

07:08.420 --> 07:10.089
You want your legs up here?
Yeah.

07:15.194 --> 07:15.995
How she doing?

07:16.028 --> 07:16.863
She's fine.

07:17.897 --> 07:19.565
She keeps on
kicking, she's okay.

07:21.801 --> 07:22.969
How about you?

07:24.937 --> 07:26.606
Fine, this is, uh,

07:28.373 --> 07:29.542
this is absurd.

07:29.575 --> 07:30.408
Yeah.

07:34.714 --> 07:35.548
What're you doing?

07:35.581 --> 07:37.216
The rental guy said there was a,

07:38.150 --> 07:39.652
there was a roadside kit.

07:44.123 --> 07:45.625
Okay, can we get...

07:45.658 --> 07:46.492
Oh yeah.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.328
Two, three, four.

08:24.463 --> 08:25.364
Here we go.

08:27.199 --> 08:28.200
There we go.

08:37.610 --> 08:38.644
Yay.

08:40.212 --> 08:41.514
And we have light.

08:42.847 --> 08:43.683
Yes.

08:44.951 --> 08:47.053
Now we could clearly see
the shit storm we're in.

08:48.354 --> 08:50.389
No, this is good, it
means we have air.

08:51.724 --> 08:53.159
I'm kidding.

08:54.026 --> 08:54.827
How is that?

08:54.860 --> 08:55.928
It's really good.

08:55.962 --> 08:56.929
Yeah?
Yeah.

08:56.963 --> 08:57.797
Want some?

10:00.192 --> 10:01.027
Shit.

10:04.464 --> 10:05.297
Matt?

10:08.034 --> 10:09.201
I have to pee.

10:11.070 --> 10:13.739
Okay.

10:15.207 --> 10:16.042
Okay.

10:17.810 --> 10:18.644
Okay, um.

10:30.990 --> 10:31.924
What are you doing?

10:31.957 --> 10:33.460
I got something.

10:36.496 --> 10:38.030
Yeah,

10:38.064 --> 10:38.898
yeah.

10:40.434 --> 10:42.068
Just ball this up and go on it.

10:43.969 --> 10:44.804
You're kidding.

10:46.506 --> 10:48.841
It's what my mother did
when she was bedridden.

10:49.942 --> 10:51.644
I had to keep
changing the towels.

10:56.516 --> 10:57.917
That's disgusting.

11:05.958 --> 11:07.126
You're okay?

11:17.603 --> 11:18.438
Sorry.

12:12.892 --> 12:14.760
I just peed on a towel.

13:28.568 --> 13:29.401
12 days

13:31.270 --> 13:32.771
and only two bottles of water.

13:34.507 --> 13:36.242
That's what we
have to survive on.

13:39.679 --> 13:42.982
What about these,
um, these chocolates?

13:43.015 --> 13:44.383
No, we're not eating those.

13:44.416 --> 13:46.453
That's the only thing
my sister's asked for.

13:50.322 --> 13:53.158
So any ideas how we're getting
out of here with this stuff?

13:56.829 --> 13:59.432
I don't think we
should get out of here.

13:59.466 --> 14:00.299
Matt,

14:01.867 --> 14:04.837
we have to try and get out of
here, we can't just stay here.

14:06.205 --> 14:09.509
I think we should break the
window and use it to dig.

14:09.542 --> 14:11.277
I think that's a
really bad idea.

14:11.310 --> 14:12.445
Why?

14:12.479 --> 14:14.313
Because we don't know
what's out there.

14:16.348 --> 14:19.586
Look, I'm not some kind
of an expert or anything

14:19.619 --> 14:21.887
but I think we should
stay right here.

14:23.222 --> 14:24.857
That's not really
much of a plan.

14:24.890 --> 14:26.358
Okay then try your phone again.

14:26.392 --> 14:28.461
I did, twice.

14:30.062 --> 14:31.363
We're gonna freeze in here.

14:31.397 --> 14:33.533
And you don't think we're
gonna freeze out there?

14:34.900 --> 14:37.102
Come on, at least
we're enclosed.

14:37.136 --> 14:40.640
We've, we've got candlelight,
we have blankets for warmth,

14:40.674 --> 14:41.974
we have body heat.

14:42.007 --> 14:44.343
And what if no one is
out there looking for us?

14:44.376 --> 14:46.278
What if it hasn't even
stopped snowing yet?

14:46.312 --> 14:47.246
If we don't show up

14:47.279 --> 14:48.013
to your book signing...
I can't believe you.

14:48.047 --> 14:48.981
What?

14:49.014 --> 14:49.783
What is so wrong with that?
I can't fucking

14:49.815 --> 14:50.983
believe this.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.117
What's wrong with it
If the weather is as bad

14:52.151 --> 14:53.352
is that you should've,
as you say it is,

14:53.385 --> 14:54.521
or else we wouldn't be
then who's gonna show uC

14:54.554 --> 14:55.354
in this situation at all!
to your book signing anyway?

14:55.387 --> 14:56.489
This is insane.

14:56.523 --> 14:57.724
No, what's insane
is traipsing around

14:57.757 --> 14:59.391
the frozen wilderness,

14:59.426 --> 15:02.462
with a pregnant lady
following the North Star,

15:02.495 --> 15:04.997
hoping we're gonna find a
Fairfield Inn or something.

15:10.704 --> 15:12.938
I just need you
to trust me, okay?

15:16.408 --> 15:17.242
Okay.

15:20.346 --> 15:21.347
Okay then.

15:24.950 --> 15:26.619
We're gonna need more layers.

15:33.693 --> 15:34.527
Okay.

17:55.033 --> 17:56.001
Good morning.

18:17.256 --> 18:18.525
Good morning.

18:37.142 --> 18:37.977
Did you eat?

18:40.613 --> 18:41.781
I'm not even hungry.

19:54.386 --> 19:57.389
What, shit, shit.
What, what is it?

19:59.124 --> 20:00.158
Fuck!

20:00.192 --> 20:01.027
Calm down.

20:01.060 --> 20:02.895
You have to put the cap back on.

20:04.464 --> 20:07.132
I'm sorry, it was an accident.

20:08.835 --> 20:09.969
You just...

20:11.136 --> 20:11.938
I just what?

20:11.971 --> 20:13.138
I just what, Matt?

20:16.141 --> 20:17.543
Nothing.

20:19.078 --> 20:19.912
Nothing.

20:23.248 --> 20:24.083
Great.

20:25.718 --> 20:26.552
Great.

20:29.856 --> 20:30.857
Good morning to you.

20:36.996 --> 20:39.032
Sorry, we just need
to be more careful.

21:36.489 --> 21:37.322
Listen.

21:40.325 --> 21:41.160
What?

21:48.601 --> 21:49.435
Hello?

21:57.610 --> 21:58.444
Hey!

22:03.315 --> 22:04.150
Hey!

22:09.155 --> 22:10.422
Hello?
Hello?

22:10.456 --> 22:11.624
Hello?
Hello?

22:11.657 --> 22:12.458
Hey!
Hey!

22:12.492 --> 22:13.960
We're down here!
In here!

22:13.993 --> 22:15.061
We're here!
Hey!

22:16.162 --> 22:16.996
Hey!
Hey!

22:17.029 --> 22:17.864
Ssh.

22:21.134 --> 22:23.503
We in here.

22:27.006 --> 22:27.840
Hello!

22:29.809 --> 22:33.246
Hello!

22:33.311 --> 22:34.113
Hello!

22:35.782 --> 22:36.616
Hello!

22:38.985 --> 22:39.819
Hello!

22:41.888 --> 22:42.722
Hello!

23:06.813 --> 23:07.880
Are you okay?

23:08.748 --> 23:09.582
Hey.

23:11.250 --> 23:12.350
Are you okay?

23:13.318 --> 23:14.153
Come here.

23:24.897 --> 23:27.332
Nowhere.

23:31.237 --> 23:32.404
Hey.

23:32.438 --> 23:34.207
Ssh, it's okay, okay?

23:36.108 --> 23:38.044
It's gonna be okay.

23:38.077 --> 23:39.679
It's gonna be okay.

25:18.544 --> 25:19.378
Okay.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.503
Hello?

26:49.535 --> 26:50.369
Daddy.

26:53.139 --> 26:53.973
Daddy!

26:55.141 --> 26:57.009
Naomi?

26:57.043 --> 26:59.078
Daddy, it's Naomi.

26:59.111 --> 27:00.780
Oh my God, oh my God.

27:03.049 --> 27:04.617
We're stuck.

27:04.650 --> 27:06.520
Is your dad on the phone?

27:06.552 --> 27:08.054
We're in Norway.

27:08.988 --> 27:10.423
Norman?

27:10.457 --> 27:13.692
We're in, we're under some snow

27:13.726 --> 27:16.695
and I don't really
know where we are, dad.

27:16.729 --> 27:17.897
Norman?

27:17.930 --> 27:20.066
Norman we're buried
on the side of a road.

27:20.099 --> 27:22.234
Daddy, can you hear me?
We are 50 miles east

27:22.268 --> 27:23.636
of our hotel.

27:23.669 --> 27:25.771
Can you hear me?

27:25.805 --> 27:26.806
Give me the phone.

27:27.940 --> 27:28.874
Dad.

27:28.908 --> 27:29.875
Give me the...

27:29.909 --> 27:30.743
Dad.

27:37.917 --> 27:38.751
It's dead.

27:48.761 --> 27:50.029
Why didn't you wake me up?

28:04.343 --> 28:07.847
This was our one chance,
do you know that?

28:37.477 --> 28:38.978
It's getting colder in here.

28:41.581 --> 28:42.915
I know.

28:49.021 --> 28:53.192
We came all this way for
my stupid book signing.

28:54.894 --> 28:55.728
No.

28:57.730 --> 28:59.533
Don't think like that.

29:07.607 --> 29:09.442
Keep your strength up.

29:14.914 --> 29:16.282
You have to eat too.

29:20.286 --> 29:21.120
I'm fine.

29:24.857 --> 29:27.092
What's gonna happen
when the food runs out?

29:32.131 --> 29:34.033
I'm getting close
on this window.

29:37.571 --> 29:42.576
If I can crack it just a few
inches, we could scrape it.

29:44.611 --> 29:45.811
We'll eat the snow.

29:47.112 --> 29:48.648
And eat our way out?

29:51.116 --> 29:54.286
Matthew, we have
to break a window,

29:54.320 --> 29:55.955
we have to start digging.

29:58.257 --> 29:59.792
Do you know what's out there?

30:01.628 --> 30:02.462
Do you know?

30:06.666 --> 30:09.068
Once it's broken, it's broken.

30:11.270 --> 30:12.104
Then what?

30:15.508 --> 30:16.942
Do you remember that story

30:18.177 --> 30:21.681
about that guy from Africa
whose boat capsized?

30:22.748 --> 30:26.018
He survived for weeks
in an air pocket.

30:26.919 --> 30:28.655
No food, nothing.

30:29.589 --> 30:30.990
He stayed put.

30:31.023 --> 30:32.592
You fucking baffle me.

30:35.160 --> 30:36.795
"It'll be fine, sweetheart,

30:36.829 --> 30:38.163
"we'll just pull
right over here,

30:38.197 --> 30:40.833
"we'll drive to the
hotel in the morning."

30:40.866 --> 30:44.069
We both agreed that
it was not a good idea

30:44.103 --> 30:47.273
to drive aimlessly
through the night.

30:47.306 --> 30:51.478
But it was a good idea to
fall asleep during a blizzard!

30:51.511 --> 30:52.746
Did you know we
were gonna wake up

30:52.778 --> 30:54.980
in the middle of the
next fucking Ice Age?

30:56.782 --> 30:58.183
What is your problem?

30:59.653 --> 31:00.620
What are you doing?

31:08.794 --> 31:09.696
What?

31:11.665 --> 31:13.600
Breathe, what's wrong?

31:14.967 --> 31:15.834
What's happening?

31:18.971 --> 31:19.838
Is it the baby?

31:22.642 --> 31:23.476
Naomi?

31:23.510 --> 31:24.343
Naomi?

31:27.012 --> 31:28.847
Pills are in my bag.

33:08.914 --> 33:10.483
We're supposed to be partners.

33:12.951 --> 33:14.153
Just leave it.

33:18.591 --> 33:21.093
Were you ever gonna tell me?

33:23.430 --> 33:24.631
It's not your problem.

33:31.504 --> 33:35.974
We can't be up each
other's asses all the time.

33:38.845 --> 33:42.347
That's being up
each other's asses?

33:42.381 --> 33:43.215
Yes.

33:45.852 --> 33:47.587
People have secrets.

33:47.620 --> 33:49.188
What the fuck does that mean?

33:55.695 --> 33:56.529
Tell me.

33:57.831 --> 33:59.599
What secrets?

33:59.632 --> 34:00.467
Just...

34:02.469 --> 34:03.302
Drop it.

34:05.237 --> 34:06.071
Please.

35:15.307 --> 35:16.976
I think we should
write a letter,

35:20.480 --> 35:21.881
for when we're discovered.

35:24.817 --> 35:25.652
No.

35:27.620 --> 35:29.956
I think we should
consider the possibility.

35:29.989 --> 35:31.390
I don't wanna hear that.

35:34.561 --> 35:36.629
Is that what you've
been so busy writing?

35:40.934 --> 35:42.936
It's not your business.

35:42.969 --> 35:44.336
It is my business.

35:45.237 --> 35:47.907
You don't get to make those
decisions for both of us.

35:50.610 --> 35:51.578
What did you write?

35:54.346 --> 35:55.515
What did you write?

35:57.082 --> 35:59.953
I wrote a stupid story, okay?

36:03.456 --> 36:04.289
About?

36:06.759 --> 36:08.628
A woman in Paris.

36:11.163 --> 36:11.998
Paris.

36:12.932 --> 36:14.099
It's a bit more glamorous

36:14.132 --> 36:16.201
than a giant heap
of snow in Norway.

36:20.039 --> 36:20.873
And?

36:24.877 --> 36:27.880
And she's a helpless
old lady who lives alone

36:29.214 --> 36:30.817
and gets stuck in her bathroom.

36:32.719 --> 36:33.553
Okay?

36:34.821 --> 36:35.655
Go on.

36:37.023 --> 36:40.526
She starts banging on the walls

36:40.560 --> 36:42.962
and clanking on the pipes,

36:42.996 --> 36:47.567
and she even opens her
window and starts yelling,

36:48.568 --> 36:49.401
and nothing.

36:50.737 --> 36:53.573
But the neighbors, they
complain about the noise,

36:54.641 --> 36:55.908
and nothing happens.

36:57.510 --> 36:58.578
Until finally,

37:01.246 --> 37:03.549
when the landlord needs
to collect his rent,

37:04.584 --> 37:07.553
it's when he breaks down
her door and finds her.

37:12.324 --> 37:13.559
Is she alive?

37:16.228 --> 37:17.396
She was barely alive.

37:21.034 --> 37:23.102
Thank you.

37:27.339 --> 37:28.508
But he evicted her.

37:37.550 --> 37:41.888
It is funny, though, who
gets stuck in a bathroom?

37:45.525 --> 37:46.592
Probably the same idiots

37:46.626 --> 37:48.528
who fall asleep
during a blizzard.

38:05.878 --> 38:06.879
Hey!

38:06.913 --> 38:08.047
Help!

38:11.651 --> 38:13.086
Help!
Hey, help!

38:14.887 --> 38:15.922
Hey!
Help me!

38:15.955 --> 38:17.123
Hey!

38:22.729 --> 38:23.563
Help!

38:34.173 --> 38:35.373
Help!

38:57.329 --> 39:01.667
Matt, Matt, stop.

39:01.701 --> 39:02.902
Fuck!

39:02.935 --> 39:03.936
Fuck!

39:03.970 --> 39:04.771
Fuck!

39:04.804 --> 39:06.139
Fuck!

39:06.172 --> 39:07.305
It's okay.
No.

39:08.141 --> 39:10.943
Listen, you were
right, you were right.

39:10.977 --> 39:14.312
Vehicles pass by here,
someone else is gonna come.

39:14.346 --> 39:16.381
No one's coming, no
one else will come.

39:18.451 --> 39:19.952
I can't catch a fucking break.

39:22.522 --> 39:24.123
What are you saying right now?

39:29.862 --> 39:30.830
I got fired.

39:37.302 --> 39:39.472
You said you had vacation time.

39:40.873 --> 39:42.141
No.

39:42.175 --> 39:43.843
No, what else can I say, I suck.

39:49.347 --> 39:50.850
I was ashamed, okay?

39:50.883 --> 39:54.319
Fucking shamed, is that
what you need to hear?

39:54.352 --> 39:56.055
What did you want me to say?

39:56.088 --> 39:58.991
Hey, hey look I know the book
isn't off to a great start

39:59.025 --> 40:01.160
and I lost my job,
but great news,

40:01.194 --> 40:02.428
we're gonna have a baby.

40:06.331 --> 40:07.867
Don't turn this around on me.

40:09.502 --> 40:10.803
No.

40:10.837 --> 40:13.739
You're doing this
because you lied.

40:13.773 --> 40:15.708
This isn't about me or the baby.

40:15.741 --> 40:17.710
No, no, no, you never
wanted this baby,

40:17.743 --> 40:19.344
that's why you're still
taking your pills.

40:19.377 --> 40:20.580
Don't you dare!

40:20.613 --> 40:22.380
Don't you fucking dare!

40:22.414 --> 40:25.383
Don't try to tell me how I
feel about having my child!

40:25.417 --> 40:26.485
Then why?

40:26.519 --> 40:28.386
Why are you still
taking your pills?

40:28.420 --> 40:31.891
I brought the pills in
case of an emergency,

40:31.924 --> 40:33.893
what this fucking is!

40:35.428 --> 40:37.496
I'm trying to do
things the right way,

40:37.530 --> 40:40.533
I'm trying to do it everything
the right way, what the fuck!

40:40.566 --> 40:43.368
Except drugging our unborn
child, that's okay, right?

40:43.401 --> 40:45.938
That doesn't cross,
hey, stop it!

40:45.972 --> 40:47.039
Stop it!

40:47.073 --> 40:48.373
Stop it!

40:48.406 --> 40:50.443
Is this what you want, huh?

40:50.476 --> 40:52.377
You want me to lash into you?

40:52.410 --> 40:53.246
Is it?

40:59.252 --> 41:01.220
Get the fuck off me.

41:04.991 --> 41:05.925
Get off me.

45:37.663 --> 45:38.498
What?

45:43.537 --> 45:44.370
Nothing.

48:49.355 --> 48:50.189
Naomi!

48:51.458 --> 48:53.693
What the hell is wrong with you?

48:53.727 --> 48:54.661
Naomi, stop!

48:54.694 --> 48:56.061
Leave me alone!

48:56.095 --> 48:57.497
We're gonna freeze in here,

48:57.530 --> 48:58.598
what the hell is wrong with you?

48:58.631 --> 49:00.366
Stay the fuck away from me!

49:03.268 --> 49:04.804
Oh, God dammit!

49:09.274 --> 49:10.242
What are you doing?

49:10.275 --> 49:11.778
Burning up.
What are you doing?

49:11.811 --> 49:13.245
Stop!

49:14.246 --> 49:15.582
I know!
What did you do to me?

49:15.615 --> 49:17.282
What did you do to me?

49:17.316 --> 49:18.217
Stop it.

49:19.251 --> 49:22.888
No, no, no, stop it, stop it.

49:22.921 --> 49:23.757
Stop it.

49:29.228 --> 49:30.463
Get off of me.

49:30.497 --> 49:33.065
Get off, get off of me!

49:33.098 --> 49:34.967
It's me, it's me.
Get off!

49:35.000 --> 49:36.135
I'm right here.

49:36.168 --> 49:37.737
Let me out!

49:37.771 --> 49:38.671
Let me out!

49:40.573 --> 49:42.074
You can't get out, okay?

49:42.107 --> 49:44.042
I'm not trying to hurt you.

49:44.076 --> 49:46.746
Please, I don't want
you to hurt yourself.

49:46.780 --> 49:48.147
What?

49:48.180 --> 49:49.081
What is it?

49:49.114 --> 49:49.948
What is it?

49:49.982 --> 49:51.150
Is it the baby?

49:51.183 --> 49:52.017
No?

49:53.085 --> 49:53.919
What is it?

49:55.522 --> 49:56.689
You need to talk to me.

49:58.090 --> 50:00.493
Is this the first
time you felt this?

50:03.496 --> 50:05.164
Why didn't you tell me anything?

50:05.197 --> 50:08.233
I don't know ,
I don't know,

50:08.267 --> 50:10.570
I can't feel anything.

50:10.603 --> 50:12.171
Okay, okay.

50:12.204 --> 50:15.608
I think you're hypothermic,
okay, we need to warm you up.

50:17.209 --> 50:19.646
We need to warm you up, okay?

50:28.888 --> 50:31.156
There you go, there you go.

50:33.726 --> 50:34.627
There you go.

50:34.661 --> 50:35.562
Okay, okay.

50:37.864 --> 50:42.702
Baby,
here, here, here.

50:44.136 --> 50:45.337
There you go.

50:45.370 --> 50:47.039
There you go.

50:47.072 --> 50:47.907
Come on.

50:51.009 --> 50:54.346
Okay, come on, gotta
put your energy up.

50:55.815 --> 50:58.050
Come on, eat, eat, come on.

51:02.522 --> 51:03.355
Okay.

51:09.261 --> 51:10.095
Okay.

51:14.199 --> 51:15.033
Okay.

51:16.268 --> 51:19.672
It's happening,
it's happening again.

51:19.706 --> 51:23.075
I think this is it.

51:23.108 --> 51:24.978
No.

51:25.010 --> 51:29.181
No, no, I can't, I can't
do this now.

51:29.214 --> 51:30.148
I can't.
I don't think we have

51:30.182 --> 51:31.818
much of a choice, baby.

51:31.851 --> 51:36.188
I can't do it, I
can't.

52:38.918 --> 52:40.887
Matt, it's coming.

52:40.920 --> 52:41.754
Okay.

52:51.464 --> 52:53.766
Naomi, you gotta push!

52:53.800 --> 52:55.267
Come on, one more push.

52:55.300 --> 52:58.004
One more push, come on, baby.

52:58.037 --> 52:59.104
Come on.

52:59.137 --> 52:59.973
Come on.

54:37.603 --> 54:38.538
What is it?

54:40.272 --> 54:41.874
I can't.

54:44.477 --> 54:45.778
Please.

54:45.812 --> 54:47.780
You gotta push, baby.

54:47.814 --> 54:49.414
Push, okay?

54:49.449 --> 54:50.282
Come on.

55:43.503 --> 55:44.771
Pancakes.

55:46.439 --> 55:48.340
Buttermilk pancakes.

55:50.143 --> 55:51.511
With salted butter.

55:53.112 --> 55:54.046
And maple syrup.

55:56.482 --> 55:57.850
And crispy bacon.

55:58.851 --> 56:00.285
Okay.

56:02.021 --> 56:03.321
Oh,

56:03.355 --> 56:04.190
like uh,

56:06.859 --> 56:08.561
applewood smoked

56:10.328 --> 56:12.165
bacon that you just

56:13.232 --> 56:15.835
scoop up some maple syrup.

56:18.704 --> 56:19.872
Waffles.

56:20.740 --> 56:22.208
Belgian waffles.

56:24.010 --> 56:26.712
So crispy and golden with

56:27.680 --> 56:32.485
ever so slightly runny eggs.
Oh, I hate runny eggs.

56:39.391 --> 56:40.827
I love you so much.

56:43.729 --> 56:44.564
I love you.

56:48.835 --> 56:50.036
Babe?
Hmm?

56:53.873 --> 56:55.074
We haven't named her yet.

56:57.910 --> 56:59.912
No, we haven't.

57:01.514 --> 57:02.949
What do you wanna name her?

57:04.550 --> 57:05.551
You make the call.

57:10.857 --> 57:12.390
How about Olivia?

57:14.694 --> 57:15.862
Like your sister?

57:16.729 --> 57:17.563
No.

57:20.900 --> 57:21.968
Like live.

57:33.112 --> 57:34.146
It's perfect.

57:42.822 --> 57:43.956
Hi, Liv.

01:00:19.311 --> 01:00:21.914
It's okay, it's okay,

01:00:23.416 --> 01:00:24.250
it's okay.

01:00:24.283 --> 01:00:25.217
You okay?

01:00:27.653 --> 01:00:28.587
Ssh, ssh.

01:00:29.889 --> 01:00:33.025
It's okay, it's okay.

01:00:33.059 --> 01:00:33.893
It's okay.

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:43.803
You're all right,
come on this way.

01:00:45.071 --> 01:00:45.971
I have you.

01:00:47.073 --> 01:00:48.808
I got you, I got you.

01:00:49.742 --> 01:00:51.877
You're okay.

01:00:51.911 --> 01:00:53.412
You're okay, baby.

01:00:55.449 --> 01:00:56.782
Give her this.

01:00:58.918 --> 01:01:00.419
I'm working up some good heat.

01:01:01.787 --> 01:01:03.622
Don't worry about me.

01:01:11.531 --> 01:01:13.365
Ssh, ssh, it's okay.

01:01:14.867 --> 01:01:16.936
It's okay.

01:03:25.965 --> 01:03:27.066
Good morning.

01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:33.739
I'm so tired.

01:03:37.176 --> 01:03:38.010
Matt.

01:03:42.081 --> 01:03:43.450
Can I have some more water?

01:03:44.917 --> 01:03:45.751
Matt.

01:03:53.792 --> 01:03:54.628
Babe?

01:04:07.339 --> 01:04:08.407
Oh no.

01:04:08.441 --> 01:04:09.275
Babe.

01:04:11.343 --> 01:04:12.344
Hold on a second.

01:04:14.614 --> 01:04:18.417
Baby, wait a minute, it's
okay, baby, it's okay.

01:04:18.451 --> 01:04:22.821
Hold on, it's okay, it's
okay, baby, it's okay.

01:04:22.855 --> 01:04:24.189
It's okay, babe.

01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:29.395
Hey, wait, wait.

01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:31.964
Matt?

01:04:34.467 --> 01:04:35.301
Matt?

01:04:35.334 --> 01:04:36.736
Hold on, hold on.

01:04:38.571 --> 01:04:39.405
Hold on.

01:04:41.708 --> 01:04:42.542
Hold on.

01:04:45.077 --> 01:04:48.581
This is not.

01:04:49.415 --> 01:04:50.249
Three.

01:05:09.769 --> 01:05:10.603
It's okay.

01:05:12.572 --> 01:05:17.544
It's okay.

01:05:41.967 --> 01:05:46.939
I'm sorry.

01:07:15.294 --> 01:07:17.129
Don't, it's just a letter.

01:08:59.231 --> 01:09:01.033
Help me, help me.

01:09:01.066 --> 01:09:01.901
Help me.

01:09:08.774 --> 01:09:11.678
Help me.

01:10:02.495 --> 01:10:07.500
Come on.

01:10:13.405 --> 01:10:15.975
Come on, baby, please, please.

01:10:38.498 --> 01:10:39.899
I know.

01:10:39.932 --> 01:10:40.767
I know.

01:10:42.568 --> 01:10:44.671
I know, sweetheart.

01:11:06.726 --> 01:11:07.560
It's okay.

01:11:11.431 --> 01:11:12.532
It's okay.

01:12:22.034 --> 01:12:25.303
Come on, baby, you
have to eat, please.

01:12:28.608 --> 01:12:29.675
Please.

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:48.728
Oh, thank God.

01:13:03.676 --> 01:13:04.510
Okay.

01:13:19.258 --> 01:13:20.760
No, of course not.

01:13:23.262 --> 01:13:24.096
She's okay.

01:13:26.165 --> 01:13:28.167
She's warm now, thanks to you.

01:13:31.771 --> 01:13:32.605
What?

01:13:41.714 --> 01:13:42.615
It is tough.

01:13:49.522 --> 01:13:51.691
You were never really
looking for your car.

01:13:56.295 --> 01:13:58.197
The cabbie was so pissed.

01:14:03.302 --> 01:14:06.138
I know.

01:14:11.210 --> 01:14:13.045
Let me see you.

01:17:51.864 --> 01:17:53.265
Liv,

01:17:53.299 --> 01:17:54.568
now.

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:58.104
We're getting out,
Liv, we're getting out.

01:17:59.138 --> 01:18:00.973
We're going home, Liv.

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:15.154
It's okay.

01:18:16.355 --> 01:18:21.227
It's okay, Liv, it's okay.

01:18:23.162 --> 01:18:25.397
At least we're getting out.

01:18:27.333 --> 01:18:29.301
We're getting out, Liv.

01:18:49.822 --> 01:18:51.157
Babe, thank you.

01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:55.428
Goodbye, love.

01:22:31.877 --> 01:22:32.911
Stay with me.

01:22:35.914 --> 01:22:37.751
Come on, stay with me.
