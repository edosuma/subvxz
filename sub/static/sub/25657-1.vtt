00:48.708 --> 00:52.167
Describe the last
person you were in a relationship with.

00:52.875 --> 00:54.125
He was a loner.

00:55.042 --> 00:56.250
He...

00:57.541 --> 00:59.042
Not an obvious choice.

00:59.917 --> 01:02.833
He needed to let himself be loved.

01:05.083 --> 01:06.958
We tried. It failed.

01:08.917 --> 01:13.209
If your dog was ill and had
to have its front legs removed to survive,

01:13.292 --> 01:16.209
would you have the surgery
or have the dog put down?

01:16.833 --> 01:18.334
I would have the surgery.

01:18.958 --> 01:22.375
What are the things that would
attract you to a potential partner?

01:23.083 --> 01:24.833
The things he loves.

01:24.917 --> 01:26.292
The things he wants to be.

01:27.625 --> 01:31.042
Whether he likes pancakes or French toast.

01:32.917 --> 01:36.541
Would you help someone you love
end their life if that was their choice?

01:37.500 --> 01:38.541
Um…

01:42.666 --> 01:43.917
Are you all right, Zoe?

01:44.958 --> 01:46.583
Yeah.

01:46.666 --> 01:48.083
It’s just…

01:49.125 --> 01:50.833
It feels funny to be doing this

01:50.917 --> 01:53.500
after working next to you for so long,
that’s all.

01:54.125 --> 01:57.250
- Would you be more comfortable if I left?
- No. It’s okay.

01:58.750 --> 02:00.541
I guess, I don’t know.

02:02.042 --> 02:04.083
My answer is, I’m not sure.

02:04.167 --> 02:07.209
What do you want your partner
to see in you?

02:43.459 --> 02:47.375
After we did the Machine,
our relationship completely changed.

02:47.459 --> 02:49.875
The way that we saw each other,

02:50.459 --> 02:52.625
and how’s it’s gonna go into the future.

02:53.167 --> 02:55.583
- We scored an 81 on the Machine.
- Yeah.

02:55.666 --> 02:59.833
And just to have that definite answer
of, no, it’s gonna work, it’s gonna…

03:07.167 --> 03:10.334
At the Relationist Lab,
head designer Cole Ainsley

03:10.417 --> 03:13.833
has been doing groundbreaking work
in the world of AI technology

03:13.917 --> 03:15.583
for almost 15 years.

03:15.666 --> 03:20.791
One of the most important things
in our experience as humans is connection.

03:20.875 --> 03:22.459
We are always looking for connection.

03:22.541 --> 03:25.375
When the board of directors
identified synthetic companions

03:25.459 --> 03:27.209
as the next big growth area,

03:27.292 --> 03:30.500
they hired Ainsley
to run the new offshoot of the company.

03:30.583 --> 03:33.143
I have nothing to do with
the pharmaceutical side of the business.

03:33.167 --> 03:35.791
I’m purely focused on the synthetic lab.

03:35.875 --> 03:40.000
So this then, for example,
is like research for you?

03:40.083 --> 03:42.125
I mean,
this is great if you want a hedge cut.

03:42.209 --> 03:45.459
But I’m much more interested,
not so much in cleaning off the bench,

03:45.541 --> 03:48.125
but who am I gonna be
sitting on that bench with.

03:48.209 --> 03:53.000
And my drive is to create synthetic people
who will become companions for us.

03:53.625 --> 03:57.583
Ultimately, you know, the idea
that you’re safe, that it’s gonna last,

03:57.666 --> 04:00.209
that they’re not... they’re not going to...

04:02.125 --> 04:06.334
They’re not going to leave you is
important, would be important to me, so…

04:07.000 --> 04:10.833
Improving lives through
better relationships is the lab’s mission.

04:17.375 --> 04:18.375
He’s ready for more.

04:18.459 --> 04:19.459
Yeah, he is.

04:19.541 --> 04:23.083
We’re the fastest-growing start-up
in the human relationship market.

04:23.666 --> 04:25.500
We’ve got three divisions:

04:25.583 --> 04:27.708
the Machine, Pharmaceuticals,

04:27.791 --> 04:31.000
and our newest venture,
Synthetic Companions.

04:31.583 --> 04:35.042
I supervise the entire lab
and run the Machine division.

04:35.125 --> 04:37.625
At the Machine,
we evaluate singles, or couples.

04:37.708 --> 04:40.292
For singles we comb our database
to find your best match.

04:40.875 --> 04:44.292
The Machine comes up with a number:
40 percent, 60 percent.

04:44.375 --> 04:48.417
The probability of two people staying
together in a happy, lasting relationship.

04:49.042 --> 04:52.833
Perfect for couples like you wondering
if they should take the next step.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.958
But you know, the numbers don’t lie.

04:55.417 --> 04:58.541
We’ve got a documented
accuracy rate in the upper 90s.

04:58.625 --> 05:02.125
But we like to say that the future
isn’t inside our computers.

05:02.708 --> 05:05.125
It’s inside you.

07:29.167 --> 07:30.875
Just answer honestly.

07:31.708 --> 07:33.209
That’s all you have to do.

07:35.625 --> 07:36.684
We scored an 81…

07:36.708 --> 07:38.125
- Good night.
- Good night.

07:38.209 --> 07:40.583
And just to have that definite answer of,

07:40.666 --> 07:43.750
no, it’s gonna work,
it’s gonna be something that’s for real.

07:54.875 --> 07:55.875
Hi.

07:55.958 --> 07:57.250
Oh, hey.

07:57.334 --> 07:58.791
Do you want some caffeine?

07:58.875 --> 08:02.541
Oh, yeah. Perfect timing. Thanks.

08:04.541 --> 08:05.958
You’ve made a lot of progress.

08:06.042 --> 08:08.334
His bio-systems for processing food
are up already.

08:08.417 --> 08:10.977
I’m sure he’s gonna be ready
for the tech summit. I’m sure of it.

08:11.541 --> 08:14.417
- Can I talk to him?
- He’s not quite there yet, no.

08:15.417 --> 08:17.666
Do you think he will look
at the world like you do?

08:17.750 --> 08:19.292
Since you designed him?

08:21.083 --> 08:22.417
Sorry.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.459
I guess it’s a personal thing. I’m sorry.

08:25.541 --> 08:27.875
No. Uh... No, that’s okay.

08:28.459 --> 08:30.500
Have a seat. I wanna show you something.

08:32.832 --> 08:36.042
I’ve given him something
called emotional packets.

08:36.541 --> 08:39.208
They’re real memories
about emotional events.

08:39.707 --> 08:44.583
Watch his synthetic facial muscles
and his body posture, how he talks.

08:47.209 --> 08:51.500
With emotions, we start with the physical
and we build inwards, see?

08:57.833 --> 08:59.042
Give it a second.

09:03.541 --> 09:05.500
Will it be different going forward?

09:07.791 --> 09:09.042
Will...

09:10.583 --> 09:12.083
Will she cheat again?

09:18.583 --> 09:20.167
Is there any way I can make it higher?

09:20.250 --> 09:22.250
There must be a way
I can I make the number…

09:27.791 --> 09:30.000
There has to be a reason
for me to have hope.

09:32.292 --> 09:33.791
Will I hate her?

09:36.791 --> 09:37.875
Do I hate her?

09:40.750 --> 09:42.167
Will I ever get beyond this?

09:47.791 --> 09:49.125
Who is he talking to?

09:50.625 --> 09:53.583
It was a conversation
that I had with the Machine.

09:54.708 --> 09:59.791
Emma and I, we scored very low.
And we never really recovered from that.

09:59.875 --> 10:03.917
The memory helps to create
his emotional infrastructure.

10:04.292 --> 10:07.666
And eventually, we erase the memory,
but the infrastructure remains.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.125
So, in a very real way, we’re...

10:12.750 --> 10:14.500
We’re teaching him how to feel.

10:15.750 --> 10:18.666
I’m sorry. I didn’t realize.

10:18.750 --> 10:21.083
Oh, it’s all right. It’s just numbers.

10:21.167 --> 10:24.167
Patterns of activation.
It looks a lot like real emotions.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.417
He’s amazing, really.

10:27.500 --> 10:31.833
No one will feel alone anymore
or feel that kind of pain.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.042
So…

10:36.833 --> 10:38.334
Oh.

10:38.417 --> 10:40.042
It’s Emma. I’ve gotta go.

10:41.750 --> 10:42.750
Cole?

10:44.292 --> 10:45.625
- Yeah.
- Oh.

10:45.708 --> 10:47.334
I-I’ll see you tomorrow, okay?

10:47.958 --> 10:49.209
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:50.042 --> 10:51.042
Okay.

10:58.958 --> 11:02.042
Yeah, see? Look.
They’ve totally come together now. Look.

11:02.625 --> 11:04.125
I’m sleeping in a tent at night.

11:04.209 --> 11:07.334
Oh, cool.
Remember when we went camping before?

11:07.417 --> 11:09.217
- Yeah.
- We didn’t have balloons though, but…

11:09.292 --> 11:11.435
- Yeah.
- Maybe next time we should take balloons.

11:11.459 --> 11:14.042
- You got any black?
- Yeah. There’s a black.

11:14.125 --> 11:16.417
- That good? Or is it too thick?
- It’s good.

11:17.708 --> 11:19.334
You did this one before?

11:24.583 --> 11:26.083
It’s really good.

11:26.958 --> 11:29.500
It’s really good.
Did you just do that one?

11:29.583 --> 11:30.791
Yeah.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.583
Art Week canceled. So did Raw Vision.
So, you know…

11:45.167 --> 11:46.750
Where did you find this?

11:46.833 --> 11:49.167
Oh. That was in the basement.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.083
I was gonna maybe, I don’t know,
use her for something.

11:52.167 --> 11:54.726
- Installation or something. Is that okay?
- Yeah, of course, yeah.

11:54.750 --> 11:57.000
I designed her when we got divorced.

11:57.083 --> 11:58.963
For people who don’t want
to sleep on their own.

11:59.042 --> 12:01.268
- That’s one good thing, right?
- That came out of the divorce?

12:01.292 --> 12:03.666
- Yeah.
- She’s still got body warmth. Amazing.

12:03.750 --> 12:07.750
Such limited functionality though.
Just a few breathing patterns, that’s all.

12:07.833 --> 12:10.334
- So naive on my part.
- Mmm.

12:10.417 --> 12:13.042
I think it stopped some people
being lonely at night.

12:13.125 --> 12:16.167
- A little spooky.
- Sleeping alone is spookier.

12:16.750 --> 12:19.625
No, actually sleeping with her
is probably quite spooky.

12:21.334 --> 12:23.334
Hey, thank you for coming tonight.

12:23.417 --> 12:27.209
- It’s really nice of you.
- Yeah, I wouldn’t have missed it.

12:27.791 --> 12:29.851
I liked it. I thought it was good.
Really, really good.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.767
- Thank you.
- Yeah. I thought it was a good show.

12:31.791 --> 12:32.791
Thank you.

12:34.833 --> 12:36.500
Look, I could, uh…

12:37.958 --> 12:42.375
I could leave or… I could stay.

12:42.459 --> 12:46.459
Uh, I started seeing someone.

12:48.750 --> 12:53.708
I mean, I’m trying, you know, to…
I’m just trying to…

12:53.791 --> 12:54.833
Yeah.

12:54.917 --> 12:57.000
I’ve got a really early start tomorrow.

12:57.083 --> 13:00.875
Why don’t you take some time off work,
you know?

13:00.958 --> 13:04.417
I just...
I want you to have the time for yourself.

13:04.541 --> 13:06.250
Maybe find someone.

13:06.334 --> 13:09.083
We’ve got so much work though.
We’ve got the tech summit coming up.

13:09.167 --> 13:11.809
The board of directors wants all heads
of department to show their work.

13:11.833 --> 13:14.833
I get it. I know. I know.
But it’s always…

13:15.541 --> 13:16.791
You always have work.

13:16.875 --> 13:18.417
But I’m fine. I’m good.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.666
- Are you?
- Yes.

13:20.791 --> 13:22.726
- Em, I’m really good.
- I don’t feel like you are.

13:22.750 --> 13:24.500
No, I’m all right.

13:25.250 --> 13:27.250
Don’t-Don’t use that in a…

13:28.375 --> 13:31.250
Don’t use it, will you?
’Cause I might want that back, I think.

13:31.334 --> 13:32.459
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:32.541 --> 13:33.893
- All right.
- Well, just for old...

13:33.917 --> 13:36.459
I mean, I made it, so. See you later.

14:22.708 --> 14:23.708
Zoe.

14:25.167 --> 14:27.459
I have some coffee. Would you like some?

14:28.042 --> 14:29.666
No, thank you. I don’t drink coffee.

14:29.750 --> 14:33.500
Ah. Well… at least we have
something in common.

14:38.209 --> 14:40.125
- When did you come online?
- This morning.

14:40.209 --> 14:43.167
I’ve been doing some research,
some reading.

14:59.625 --> 15:01.125
Your skin, it’s, uh…

15:04.875 --> 15:06.292
softer than mine.

15:09.833 --> 15:11.042
Sorry.

15:13.666 --> 15:16.083
Cole wants to start
my socialization immediately.

15:17.167 --> 15:18.708
Asked him if I could learn to dance.

15:20.459 --> 15:21.625
Good idea.

15:22.833 --> 15:26.292
But maybe we should start
with what you’ve been reading.

15:26.375 --> 15:28.125
Okay. Let’s do that.

15:39.541 --> 15:43.125
Your chances for a successful
relationship are 75 percent.

15:46.083 --> 15:47.459
Congratulations.

15:49.917 --> 15:51.877
I think we can’t help as human beings

15:51.917 --> 15:53.875
but let each other down in relationships.

15:53.958 --> 15:55.833
We try, but we can’t help it.

15:55.917 --> 15:58.625
Synthetic people,
they’ll be able to understand you.

15:58.708 --> 16:03.334
They’ll be able to read you and your
feelings and your emotional needs.

16:18.042 --> 16:19.958
And then now you’re going.

16:20.042 --> 16:22.167
Okay. Like this? All right.

16:22.250 --> 16:25.000
- And then?
- And then I have a... and so we go...

16:25.083 --> 16:26.958
Mm-hmm.

16:27.042 --> 16:30.625
Then the same, then we just go back.
That’s basically the foot movement.

16:30.708 --> 16:32.209
- Okay.
- And we try not to look down.

16:32.292 --> 16:35.583
Try and look her in the eyes.
You’re dancing with a beautiful woman.

16:35.666 --> 16:37.500
- Beautiful, right.
- It’s romantic.

16:37.583 --> 16:40.791
And then we can turn,
sort of clockwise we can start to turn.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.209
- Like this, you see?
- Yeah.

16:42.292 --> 16:44.209
Look.

16:44.791 --> 16:47.042
All right, Zoe.
What do you think of Fred Astaire?

16:47.125 --> 16:48.833
It’s really, really good.

16:49.417 --> 16:51.250
- Here.
- Um...

16:51.334 --> 16:52.708
I wanted to ask you something.

16:52.791 --> 16:55.958
Do you think I can get evaluated
by the Machine?

16:57.583 --> 16:59.625
- Okay.
- Yeah?

17:00.209 --> 17:01.917
Sure, we can set that up, yeah.

17:02.791 --> 17:04.459
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:05.583 --> 17:07.083
Go ask her to dance.

17:08.291 --> 17:10.958
Uh, Zoe, would you care to dance?

17:12.209 --> 17:15.000
Yeah.

17:20.041 --> 17:21.875
Okay, looking,
looking at the beautiful lady.

17:21.958 --> 17:23.083
- Yes. Yeah.
- Nice.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.459
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:24.540 --> 17:26.334
- Okay.
- It’s nice.

17:27.833 --> 17:30.500
What do you want
your partner to see in you?

17:38.209 --> 17:39.334
I would…

17:41.250 --> 17:44.292
I would like him to see things
no one else does.

17:45.042 --> 17:49.125
What is something you wouldn’t want
your partner to know about you?

17:57.250 --> 17:59.292
I used to be heavy.

18:00.250 --> 18:01.250
Really heavy.

18:03.708 --> 18:06.042
The kind of heavy
that makes you invisible.

18:08.417 --> 18:09.459
And…

18:10.459 --> 18:12.791
I guess I still have trouble with food.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.375
But I would like it
if he didn’t know that.

18:29.708 --> 18:31.459
- You okay, Zoe?
- Yeah.

18:32.292 --> 18:34.167
Easier to be on the other side.

18:59.334 --> 19:00.750
Match our compatibility.

19:01.625 --> 19:03.042
One moment, please.

19:05.875 --> 19:11.167
Your chances of a successful relationship
for this pairing are zero percent.

19:16.125 --> 19:18.791
Is there a reason why
the percentage is so low?

19:20.417 --> 19:22.875
There is a fundamental incompatibility.

19:45.375 --> 19:46.666
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.541
- You okay?
- Yeah, I’m fine.

19:48.625 --> 19:50.292
- Feeling all right?
- Yeah.

19:51.334 --> 19:52.334
I just wanted to check.

19:52.417 --> 19:54.976
Sometimes after the evaluation,
people say they feel a bit weird.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.292
I’m… I’m totally fine.

19:57.375 --> 19:59.500
I just needed some air. That’s all.

20:00.083 --> 20:03.042
- You sure?
- Yeah... It’s fine.

20:03.125 --> 20:06.583
- And you? What are you doing?
- I’m working with Ash. So much to do.

20:06.666 --> 20:08.750
- Okay.
- Yeah.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.750
- Good night.
- Okay. I’ll see you tomorrow.

20:12.833 --> 20:14.726
- Yeah, see ya tomorrow.
- I’ll see you back here.

20:14.750 --> 20:16.500
- Yeah.
- Okay. Have a good night.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.625
You too.

20:37.334 --> 20:39.791
Serotonin levels increasing 30 percent.

20:49.167 --> 20:50.000
What is this?

20:50.083 --> 20:52.583
It’s part of a clinical trial
for a new drug.

20:53.209 --> 20:54.209
Benzomorphodone.

20:54.625 --> 20:55.917
It’ll be marketed as Benysol.

20:56.833 --> 20:58.875
- What does it cure?
- It doesn’t cure anything.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.541
When you take it with someone else,

21:00.625 --> 21:03.875
it triggers the exact sequence
of hormones and neurotransmitters

21:03.958 --> 21:05.917
that fire when you fall in love.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.417
Not euphoria or mood shifters
like what’s out there now.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.083
This is brand-new and entirely different.

21:12.708 --> 21:15.417
That couple has been married for 35 years,

21:15.500 --> 21:19.292
but Benysol lets them access something
no one gets to feel more than once.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.250
Falling in love for the first time.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.334
That moment is in each pill.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.334
Would you, um…

21:37.500 --> 21:39.541
Would you want to take the drug with me?

21:41.459 --> 21:43.791
I’d like us to be a couple.

21:43.875 --> 21:46.833
Ash, what you’re feeling is a program.

21:48.209 --> 21:49.334
Zeros and ones.

21:49.917 --> 21:52.292
Machines don’t really feel
the way people do.

21:55.167 --> 21:56.167
Yeah.

22:01.833 --> 22:04.708
I think your socialization
shouldn’t just be in a lab.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.833
He seems totally relaxed though.

22:11.292 --> 22:14.375
- Yeah. Just easy.
- Mm-hmm.

22:19.209 --> 22:20.917
This is going so well.

22:23.334 --> 22:25.375
I think he’s trying to speak French.

22:34.375 --> 22:35.833
I’m glad you came tonight.

22:35.917 --> 22:37.042
Me too.

22:37.125 --> 22:41.000
And I was hoping maybe we could
have one drink downstairs.

22:41.666 --> 22:42.750
What’s downstairs?

22:44.791 --> 22:45.791
Come.

22:53.125 --> 22:54.167
Come.

22:59.625 --> 23:01.666
- I wanna show you something.
- What is it?

23:11.125 --> 23:12.375
It’s a robo-brothel.

23:13.666 --> 23:16.958
I found this ’cause I was curious
how other people were using synthetics.

23:17.708 --> 23:20.708
- I never knew this was down here.
- I thought you might like it.

23:21.583 --> 23:24.750
It’s totally legal because you’re
not paying to be with a real person.

23:35.292 --> 23:36.334
That’s Jewels.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.791
She has the most advanced
operating system.

23:42.167 --> 23:44.209
I can activate one for you if you like.

23:44.292 --> 23:46.334
- Sorry?
- Jewels is booked.

23:46.417 --> 23:48.375
But any of them
will talk to you how you want,

23:49.042 --> 23:50.334
do to you what you want.

23:51.042 --> 23:53.500
They’ll take you places you’ve never been.

23:53.583 --> 23:55.541
Does she know what you’re doing to her?

23:55.625 --> 23:56.625
That one?

23:57.334 --> 23:58.708
She’s about to be deactivated.

23:59.750 --> 24:02.500
It isn’t worried, or afraid,
or anything else.

24:03.209 --> 24:06.958
But you can still be with it
in the moments before it’s destroyed,

24:07.042 --> 24:08.833
if that’s your thing.

24:09.666 --> 24:11.042
Because there is no “her.”

24:14.500 --> 24:16.000
Uh-huh.

24:19.833 --> 24:21.125
Cole.

24:21.209 --> 24:22.500
Cole, wait.

24:23.209 --> 24:25.833
Wait. I’m so sorry.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.708
That’s not why I brought you down here.

24:28.791 --> 24:30.417
I know. I know.

24:31.917 --> 24:33.125
You know, the other day…

24:34.292 --> 24:36.917
After the Machine evaluation,
I did something.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.541
- I ran a match with you and me.
- Zoe.

24:39.625 --> 24:41.083
It was zero.

24:43.167 --> 24:47.459
I, um... I just thought
it doesn’t make any sense, you know.

24:48.250 --> 24:49.958
Because of how I feel.

24:50.958 --> 24:51.958
I...

24:53.167 --> 24:56.292
I wonder all the time
if you think about me.

24:58.167 --> 24:59.167
Zoe.

25:01.209 --> 25:02.250
It’s…

25:03.625 --> 25:05.042
It’s not like that.

25:05.125 --> 25:06.625
I just thought…

25:08.791 --> 25:11.042
you might feel it too.

25:16.042 --> 25:17.666
I have to show you something.

25:31.417 --> 25:33.000
Why are you bringing me home?

25:33.083 --> 25:35.167
I want to talk to you about something.

25:39.083 --> 25:41.125
You have keys to my apartment?

25:41.209 --> 25:42.666
I have a set, yeah.

25:45.167 --> 25:47.791
- What is this, Cole?
- Come on. Just come…

25:49.250 --> 25:51.791
Just come sit down. I-I want to explain.

25:55.083 --> 25:56.541
Have a seat.

25:58.917 --> 26:00.459
You trust me, don’t you?

26:01.167 --> 26:02.541
- Yes.
- Okay.

26:02.625 --> 26:05.125
Have you ever done a search
for yourself online?

26:07.042 --> 26:09.209
Yes. When I was younger.

26:09.292 --> 26:11.250
But not in the last few months, no?

26:12.042 --> 26:14.083
No. Why?

26:14.167 --> 26:17.167
You might be surprised to find out
there’s not very much there.

26:18.292 --> 26:21.292
Nothing about being
accepted early to college or, um...

26:21.375 --> 26:25.708
No press release about you being hired
to run the Machine division at the lab.

26:25.791 --> 26:28.334
Nothing about who you are.

26:31.459 --> 26:33.375
Why do you have keys to my apartment?

26:33.459 --> 26:36.083
The apartment belongs to the lab.

26:36.167 --> 26:37.958
I rented it only a few months ago.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.541
What are you talking about?

26:42.625 --> 26:45.292
Do you ever wonder
why there’s no food in your fridge?

26:45.375 --> 26:47.708
Why everything in here is so new?

26:50.000 --> 26:52.125
This isn’t gonna be easy to say,
and, um…

26:53.167 --> 26:54.334
it’s gonna sound a bit crazy,

26:54.417 --> 26:57.958
but you don’t oversee
the Synthetics division at the lab.

27:01.334 --> 27:02.750
You’re a creation of it.

27:05.167 --> 27:07.000
The reason you scored zero with me

27:07.083 --> 27:10.167
was because the Machine
could see that you were synthetic.

27:11.292 --> 27:13.250
Why would you say this to me?

27:13.334 --> 27:15.042
It was a test.

27:15.125 --> 27:19.250
To see how people would connect with you,
if they would connect with you.

27:19.334 --> 27:23.167
To see how Ash would react to you.
To see if anyone would be able to tell.

27:24.459 --> 27:25.917
Go and look in the mirror.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.500
Look at your eyes really close,
and you’ll see.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.500
You’ll see.

27:34.083 --> 27:36.417
You’ve only been online
for a couple of months.

27:39.708 --> 27:42.209
- Oh, my God.
- I’m so sorry, Zoe.

27:45.250 --> 27:46.750
I should have told you sooner.

27:53.459 --> 27:54.500
Zoe.

27:58.791 --> 27:59.791
Zoe.

28:19.708 --> 28:21.917
To tell you the truth,
I’m a little jealous.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.708
- Why?
- You got to be human.

28:26.125 --> 28:28.625
- But it was a lie.
- Not to me.

28:31.708 --> 28:34.500
You know,
I read that you know when you’re in love

28:34.583 --> 28:37.500
because you can’t fall asleep.

28:37.583 --> 28:40.042
Because your reality
is better than your dreams.

28:40.125 --> 28:42.125
Sounds like Freud.

28:42.209 --> 28:44.500
Eh. Dr. Seuss.

28:49.083 --> 28:50.083
Zoe.

29:03.625 --> 29:05.250
It was a mistake.

29:06.292 --> 29:08.292
I should have told you so much sooner.

29:09.750 --> 29:12.375
I had no idea you would evolve like this.
I didn’t.

29:13.666 --> 29:15.708
Was I designed to have feelings for you?

29:16.459 --> 29:17.833
No.

29:17.917 --> 29:20.666
No. You have tendencies,
just like people, that’s all.

29:23.708 --> 29:26.292
Are you going to deactivate me now?

29:26.375 --> 29:29.000
No. That’s not what you want, is it?

29:31.500 --> 29:33.125
I mean, you know…

29:34.583 --> 29:36.083
this is my life.

29:40.083 --> 29:43.042
I realized I’ve never done anything real.

29:44.958 --> 29:47.541
I’ve never stayed up late
with girlfriends.

29:48.833 --> 29:52.875
I’ve never… talked on a
phone with a boy.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.791
I’ve never worn perfume.

30:00.708 --> 30:03.125
I’d like to show you
some of the things you’ve done.

30:04.750 --> 30:06.292
Okay?

30:17.000 --> 30:18.791
I started here when I was 15.

30:19.833 --> 30:22.375
I was overweight, terrified.

30:24.042 --> 30:26.541
But it’s like
all the memories you gave to Ash.

30:29.375 --> 30:30.791
It didn’t happen.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.583
They happened.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.417
You had real emotional experiences.

30:35.500 --> 30:39.833
How you store those memories or how you
remember them doesn’t make them less real.

30:41.583 --> 30:44.292
- What else happened here?
- Mmm.

30:44.375 --> 30:45.791
- Daydream.
- Mm-hmm.

30:45.875 --> 30:47.541
Study on nice days.

30:48.125 --> 30:51.167
I wrote a whole paper once
on my laptop under that tree.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.500
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

30:52.583 --> 30:54.167
I would sit there

30:54.917 --> 30:56.167
and wonder…

30:57.417 --> 30:59.541
how it was going to turn out for me.

31:01.167 --> 31:03.666
Imagining all the possibilities
of what I could be.

31:05.791 --> 31:11.875
I hated school because I always felt
that I was one among many.

31:11.958 --> 31:14.625
I can understand that feeling
of feeling alone with lots of people.

31:14.708 --> 31:15.541
Yeah.

31:15.625 --> 31:18.018
Some people peak there.
They’re the coolest people at school.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.500
Then the rest of their lives
are very mundane and ordinary.

31:20.583 --> 31:21.583
Like a misfit.

31:21.666 --> 31:22.958
Nerd.

31:23.042 --> 31:24.917
- I felt like that too.
- Nerd, is it?

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
- No. I said I felt like that too.
- Yeah.

31:27.083 --> 31:29.708
- I didn’t think you were a nerd.
- No, I was just...

31:29.791 --> 31:32.750
Nerd! That would be a bit cruel.

31:32.833 --> 31:34.459
“I felt like a misfit.” “Nerd!”

31:34.541 --> 31:36.459
“No, I’m not a nerd. A misfit.”

31:38.541 --> 31:40.541
Miss, I have a question.

31:40.625 --> 31:43.875
What are... What body functions
are we gonna learn today?

31:43.958 --> 31:46.083
This little thing.

31:47.625 --> 31:49.083
It’s a little camel toe.

31:51.541 --> 31:53.833
I don’t think that’s
gonna reproduce anything, really.

31:53.917 --> 31:57.791
Spermatozoid will go in the camel toe.

32:00.541 --> 32:02.209
- It goes in it.
- Go on.

32:02.292 --> 32:05.459
Creates another human being.

32:05.541 --> 32:06.625
Very easy.

32:06.708 --> 32:08.875
That’s the story of humanity.

32:08.958 --> 32:11.278
You’ve been so thorough,
I don’t have any questions at all.

32:11.334 --> 32:13.750
You’ve covered all bases, I think.

32:14.292 --> 32:16.143
- You’re not supposed to be here.
- Oh, sorry.

32:16.167 --> 32:17.750
- Sorry.
- Yeah. Sorry. Right.

32:18.666 --> 32:20.417
Right.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.459
It’s a private research library.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.958
It’s not even open to the grad students.

32:42.042 --> 32:43.250
- It’s nice.
- Yeah.

32:43.334 --> 32:44.875
- It’s got a good smell to it.
- Yeah.

32:44.958 --> 32:47.250
- Smells like old.
- It does have a very old...

32:47.334 --> 32:49.292
- Like an old grandma.
- Like an old grandma?

32:49.375 --> 32:50.583
That’s right.

32:52.708 --> 32:55.292
What was she like,
the person whose memories I have?

32:56.500 --> 32:59.125
Well, it wasn’t just one person.
It was several.

32:59.209 --> 33:01.000
They were mainly students.

33:01.083 --> 33:04.209
And is there anything
from your past inside me?

33:05.375 --> 33:07.459
Anything from what happened with Emma?

33:08.666 --> 33:09.666
No.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.209
The idea was for you to be completely you.

33:14.417 --> 33:17.500
To have your own thoughts and hopes,
flaws.

33:18.708 --> 33:22.083
- I don’t have any flaws.
- No, of course. You don’t have any flaws.

33:22.167 --> 33:24.459
Well, hopes and thoughts anyway.

33:26.541 --> 33:28.625
You never answered my question.

33:29.791 --> 33:33.125
About whether you ever think of me.

33:36.375 --> 33:38.042
Well, of course I have.

33:40.083 --> 33:43.625
But I can’t unsee some of the ways
I’ve seen you, in the beginning.

33:44.791 --> 33:49.083
In some ways, I think it makes me
even more in awe of who you are now.

33:53.958 --> 33:55.375
Yeah.

33:56.125 --> 33:57.334
Everyone walks by here.

34:00.125 --> 34:01.625
I used to watch them all the time.

34:02.583 --> 34:03.583
Hmm.

34:04.625 --> 34:07.459
Coming and going and, you know, waiting…

34:08.791 --> 34:10.625
for the person they loved.

34:13.875 --> 34:15.458
But none of it was real.

34:18.958 --> 34:20.791
I never saw those people.

34:21.666 --> 34:23.791
I was never even here.

34:26.292 --> 34:28.541
Who’s going to love someone
who’s not real?

34:30.125 --> 34:31.750
Zoe, you can’t think like that.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.250
What’s happening to me?

34:48.583 --> 34:50.583
Why are there no tears in my eyes?

34:50.666 --> 34:52.541
Th-There won’t be any tears.

34:54.791 --> 34:57.125
When you were designed,
we couldn’t have imagined

34:57.209 --> 35:00.334
how your emotional life would grow
with these highs and lows.

35:01.083 --> 35:02.875
We didn’t see that coming.

35:02.958 --> 35:07.417
The reason you can’t produce any tears
is your body literally can’t make them.

35:08.375 --> 35:10.917
And I know that’s not fair. I’m sorry.

35:12.292 --> 35:13.666
I’m sorry.

35:56.833 --> 35:59.042
Anyway, I’m gonna go upstairs now.

36:01.541 --> 36:04.000
Anyway, I’m gonna head off. Bye.

36:05.334 --> 36:06.708
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:08.417 --> 36:10.708
- Where did you guys go?
- We just talked.

36:11.750 --> 36:15.334
You know, I read that dating in the office
is a sure path to heartbreak.

36:16.750 --> 36:18.250
You guys gonna be a couple?

36:20.541 --> 36:22.125
I don’t know.

36:23.625 --> 36:24.625
Yeah.

36:35.583 --> 36:38.417
Want to see the future?
You can find it in our pavilion.

36:39.083 --> 36:41.334
Want to see the future?
You can find it in our pavilion.

36:41.417 --> 36:44.083
Another one like there,
which is the opposite of that one.

36:44.167 --> 36:47.000
They didn’t even tell me about this.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.917
She’s just captivating, isn’t she?

36:53.000 --> 36:56.417
- These people have no idea.
- Yeah. They don’t know.

36:59.791 --> 37:03.125
Like the Tin Man over there?
Like, that’s what people are expecting.

37:03.209 --> 37:05.750
- No. That’s right, yeah.
- They have no idea.

37:05.833 --> 37:07.459
Where’s Ash? When’s he on?

37:07.541 --> 37:09.583
- What time is it?
- It’s 9:45.

37:09.666 --> 37:11.346
Probably getting ready for his big speech.

37:11.375 --> 37:13.583
- You think he’s rehearsing the speech?
- I bet he is.

37:13.666 --> 37:15.167
Is he nervous?

37:16.541 --> 37:18.958
Want to see the future?
You can find it in our pavilion.

37:19.042 --> 37:20.791
Accelerated breakthrough…

37:22.167 --> 37:25.209
Want to see the future?
You can find it in our pavilion.

37:26.666 --> 37:30.167
How many of you have considered
the actual possibility

37:30.250 --> 37:32.875
of a relationship with a synthetic?

37:34.209 --> 37:36.209
Of course you haven’t.

37:36.292 --> 37:41.541
Because they are your dog walkers
or maybe a gardener, maybe a housekeeper.

37:42.125 --> 37:44.791
Because they’re primitive, right?
They’re robotic.

37:45.417 --> 37:46.917
They’re not real.

37:48.292 --> 37:49.791
But what if they weren’t?

37:50.875 --> 37:52.042
What if I told you…

37:53.750 --> 37:55.750
I am a synthetic?

37:59.125 --> 38:02.000
What if I told you I could improvise
when I play piano?

38:02.583 --> 38:05.708
That I feel pain? That I can make jokes?

38:05.791 --> 38:08.417
That I can gauge your emotions
and sense what you’re feeling

38:08.500 --> 38:10.583
better than anyone in this room?

38:12.042 --> 38:14.000
Right now, I’m feeling curiosity. Maybe.

38:19.917 --> 38:21.583
I’ll never break your heart.

38:22.583 --> 38:23.708
I’ll never leave you.

38:25.750 --> 38:28.666
And I am designed to love you
and understand you

38:28.750 --> 38:30.875
in ways that humans simply can’t.

38:31.708 --> 38:33.708
And if you want more proof…

38:35.250 --> 38:36.917
just look into my eyes.

38:48.958 --> 38:53.125
The symposium on advancement
in nanosurgery begins in 15 minutes.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.125
This is all interactive.

39:41.209 --> 39:43.666
Translates our voices into images.

39:43.750 --> 39:46.000
It can even hear you whisper.

39:47.042 --> 39:49.334
Whisper.

39:49.958 --> 39:51.583
Whisper. Oh, yeah.

39:52.417 --> 39:53.833
Say something.

39:54.917 --> 39:56.541
Hello. Hi.

39:57.625 --> 39:58.459
Louder.

39:58.541 --> 39:59.791
Hello!

40:00.334 --> 40:01.750
Oh, wow, look.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.167
Hello!

40:03.250 --> 40:05.750
I’m here in an empty room!

40:05.833 --> 40:08.958
Shouting! I feel a little silly!

40:18.459 --> 40:21.250
Whoo!

40:34.791 --> 40:37.083
Fuck!

41:44.750 --> 41:46.500
- Zoe.
- Yeah?

41:49.000 --> 41:52.875
Would you be upset
if we waited… a little bit?

41:54.917 --> 41:56.958
- Do you want me to go?
- No.

41:58.917 --> 42:00.791
I want you to stay.

42:54.375 --> 42:55.459
Exercise.

43:10.708 --> 43:13.292
Incoming.

43:16.917 --> 43:18.500
- Do you like him?
- Yeah.

43:18.583 --> 43:20.292
Why don’t you pull my finger?

43:25.583 --> 43:27.417
So you have many rocks?

43:28.000 --> 43:30.583
Yeah.

43:30.666 --> 43:32.292
- Do you think I’m nice?
- Yeah.

43:32.375 --> 43:33.500
- Really?
- Yeah.

43:33.583 --> 43:36.292
Well, you have to stay here with him.
I’m going home.

43:39.708 --> 43:42.875
- Do you guys wanna stay for dinner?
- No, we’ve, um...

43:42.958 --> 43:44.708
We should get back.

43:44.791 --> 43:46.875
- Caleb really likes her.
- Yeah.

43:48.292 --> 43:51.375
I didn’t mention to him about her,
like what… who she is.

43:51.459 --> 43:56.042
Well, there’s a difference between
what we see and what we know.

43:57.625 --> 44:01.666
So should I tell him or not tell him?
What does that mean?

44:01.750 --> 44:02.791
Tell him.

44:02.875 --> 44:05.958
Tell him.
I’m worried he’s gonna freak out though.

44:06.042 --> 44:07.541
- He likes her, you know.
- Yeah.

44:07.625 --> 44:09.334
- I don’t think so.
- Okay.

44:09.417 --> 44:10.809
- I’ll tell him.
- See you Thursday.

44:10.833 --> 44:13.167
Yeah, thanks.
This was really nice, thank you.

44:13.250 --> 44:15.226
- And bring her.
- Okay, I’ll bring her on Thursday.

44:15.250 --> 44:16.250
Yeah.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.875
Yeah, I do like that.

45:00.917 --> 45:02.250
Is Jewels available?

45:03.750 --> 45:06.250
I can pay. I just want to talk to her.

45:12.125 --> 45:14.125
I suspected you were synthetic.

45:15.334 --> 45:16.750
You are, aren’t you?

45:19.083 --> 45:20.334
Flawless work.

45:21.750 --> 45:23.334
You must cost a fortune.

45:24.167 --> 45:26.875
You wanna ask her
what it’s like to be with all these men?

45:28.083 --> 45:30.500
You know, we’d do very well
if you worked here with me.

45:30.583 --> 45:32.791
My clients are respectable. You’d be safe.

45:32.875 --> 45:37.209
And if you’re programmed to connect,
you might even find it rewarding.

45:37.791 --> 45:40.250
Your designer’s done you
a grave injustice.

45:40.334 --> 45:43.000
He’s given you aspirations
you’ll never achieve.

45:43.583 --> 45:44.917
Eventually you’ll see…

45:46.125 --> 45:49.042
there’s no humanity inside something
that can be turned off.

45:59.583 --> 46:02.042
Why don’t you tell me
about why you came here?

46:02.125 --> 46:03.541
I’ve been...

46:03.625 --> 46:05.958
I guess I’m here because

46:06.042 --> 46:09.583
I want to know what it’s like
for you in your sessions.

46:11.292 --> 46:14.000
The person I’m with, he...

46:14.583 --> 46:15.583
We haven’t…

46:16.583 --> 46:18.958
He doesn’t seem to want to...

46:19.042 --> 46:23.167
You’d be surprised how many men come
to me and don’t want anything physical.

46:23.250 --> 46:24.334
Some just talk.

46:24.958 --> 46:26.708
Some just want forgiveness.

46:27.791 --> 46:31.583
What I’ve learned about men is that
sometimes they don’t really desire you.

46:32.708 --> 46:34.875
They desire the way you make them feel.

46:35.917 --> 46:39.000
But they… they know you’re not real.

46:39.083 --> 46:42.125
The Designer only cares
that we’re real enough to make money.

46:43.417 --> 46:45.625
D-Do you feel a connection to any of them?

46:49.417 --> 46:50.583
I don’t know.

46:53.833 --> 46:54.833
Do you feel?

46:56.375 --> 46:57.500
Yes.

46:58.500 --> 47:00.417
You’re what’s coming.

47:14.625 --> 47:16.042
My skin is wearing out.

47:16.750 --> 47:19.250
There’s a limit to how many times
she can regrade us.

47:20.750 --> 47:22.209
We end up on the street or…

47:23.250 --> 47:27.125
or repurposed if men don’t want to see me.

47:27.708 --> 47:29.250
I can help you.

47:29.334 --> 47:31.625
You... You go here.

47:32.292 --> 47:34.000
You ask for me or Ash.

47:34.083 --> 47:37.042
I don’t, um...
We’re not really allowed to...

47:37.625 --> 47:38.985
- Take it.
- Jewels!

47:40.292 --> 47:41.375
Client.

47:42.750 --> 47:45.917
- I have to go.
- Thank you. Thank you.

48:23.000 --> 48:28.042
I once told Ash that what he felt for me
was only zeros and ones.

48:29.083 --> 48:30.750
You’re not Ash.

48:32.833 --> 48:35.459
Do you think you could
prove to me that you’re real?

48:36.875 --> 48:38.250
If you had to?

48:39.750 --> 48:40.875
Zoe.

48:41.958 --> 48:45.125
- We don’t...
- Sometimes, the way you look at me…

48:46.250 --> 48:47.958
or don’t look at me…

48:49.625 --> 48:51.500
I feel like that’s what I have to do.

48:52.459 --> 48:55.375
So… I wonder.

48:58.292 --> 49:00.167
Could you do it?

49:06.583 --> 49:08.917
When I first started working in AI,

49:09.500 --> 49:11.875
the skeptics said that only humans
could be creative

49:11.958 --> 49:13.708
or dream.

49:15.042 --> 49:16.042
Or feel.

49:18.833 --> 49:20.417
I know you feel.

49:35.167 --> 49:36.375
- Want some?
- Mm-hmm.

49:36.459 --> 49:37.459
Wine?

49:47.000 --> 49:48.375
Much better.

49:48.459 --> 49:52.083
- Because of the milk, more, um, moisture.
- Mm-hmm.

49:55.459 --> 49:57.209
Would you change anything?

49:57.292 --> 50:00.917
- It’s not symmetrical.
- I know, but people aren’t symmetrical.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.042
Like this side’s more handsome
than this side or something.

50:04.125 --> 50:06.042
I wouldn’t change anything.

50:08.666 --> 50:12.209
His teacher said he tries.

50:13.292 --> 50:15.476
- Did you hear the joke about...
- The vacuum cleaner?

50:15.500 --> 50:18.334
Vacuum cleaner.

50:21.375 --> 50:24.459
I asked for that. I really asked for that.

50:30.875 --> 50:33.000
You’ll never have better chips than these.

50:33.083 --> 50:36.375
It doesn’t matter what you say
so long as you say it honestly

50:36.459 --> 50:38.209
and what you say is honest.

50:41.541 --> 50:45.042
No, Zoe, Zoe, Zoe, it’s so nice.

50:50.875 --> 50:52.042
Hello.

50:52.125 --> 50:53.625
I love you more.

50:56.375 --> 50:59.417
- I couldn’t picture my life without you.
- Aw.

51:05.125 --> 51:06.666
I love you too.

51:26.459 --> 51:28.875
I didn’t know if you had any plans
this weekend.

52:57.750 --> 52:59.750
A spring.

53:04.583 --> 53:06.875
Oh, I think so, yeah. You wanna go in?

53:06.958 --> 53:08.459
- I’m not sure.
- It’s not too cold.

53:08.541 --> 53:10.167
- It’s too cold.
- It’s not too cold.

53:10.250 --> 53:13.958
- You’re crazy.
- We’re gonna do it. We’re going in.

53:14.042 --> 53:15.209
- No!
- Yes!

53:15.833 --> 53:17.708
We’re gonna do this!

53:19.750 --> 53:23.125
- Oh!
- Is it cold? Is it cold?

53:23.209 --> 53:24.666
No, it’s okay.

53:24.750 --> 53:27.833
- Okay!
- You can do it.

53:30.791 --> 53:32.292
Whoo!

53:33.000 --> 53:36.334
It’s freezing cold!

53:36.417 --> 53:39.250
Oh, my God!

53:45.375 --> 53:48.167
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

53:50.459 --> 53:52.334
Thank you for everything.

53:55.917 --> 53:57.666
I wanted you to have this.

53:59.209 --> 54:00.666
This is real?

54:02.167 --> 54:04.000
Not part of a test?

54:04.750 --> 54:06.083
There’s no test.

54:08.541 --> 54:13.000
I could tell, when I told you how I felt,
that you were afraid.

54:13.583 --> 54:15.083
You still are.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.500
But less now.

54:21.625 --> 54:23.875
- You can see that?
- Mm-hmm.

54:54.459 --> 54:58.250
I have memories,
but I’m not sure I know what to do.

54:59.750 --> 55:00.750
Don’t worry.

55:02.042 --> 55:03.750
Just be.

55:03.833 --> 55:05.209
Don’t think.

55:39.083 --> 55:40.334
Good morning.

55:44.334 --> 55:45.917
We scored a 66.

55:47.292 --> 55:49.209
That was all we needed to see.

55:50.833 --> 55:52.000
Well, well, well.

55:53.583 --> 55:57.250
Looks like someone spent the weekend
testing the limits of her functionality.

55:57.334 --> 55:59.292
Well, someone call the techs.

55:59.375 --> 56:01.459
I think we discovered you can blush.

56:05.500 --> 56:07.250
You know this hurts me, don’t you?

56:08.791 --> 56:10.292
Seeing you with someone else.

56:11.042 --> 56:14.167
You know, there’s different kinds
of relationships, Ash.

56:15.334 --> 56:16.917
Different kinds of love.

56:17.541 --> 56:18.958
Friends can love each other.

56:20.625 --> 56:21.666
Yeah.

56:28.417 --> 56:29.791
What was it like?

56:31.125 --> 56:32.500
To feel so human?

56:42.209 --> 56:43.917
What are you thinking?

56:44.000 --> 56:46.791
It’s a very romantic situation.

56:55.292 --> 56:57.167
I was thinking we should go to Iceland.

56:57.250 --> 56:59.875
And we should get a car
with a tent on the roof,

56:59.958 --> 57:02.459
and we should drive
around the whole island of Iceland

57:02.541 --> 57:05.167
and explore and look at the snow
and the ice floes

57:05.250 --> 57:06.666
and look at shit like that.

57:06.750 --> 57:08.583
New York City.

57:09.958 --> 57:12.917
Where the city never sleeps.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.750
- Why?
- Because we don’t need to sleep there.

57:15.833 --> 57:17.042
But why?

57:19.209 --> 57:20.583
I’m happy here.

57:25.791 --> 57:27.292
Me too.

57:31.666 --> 57:33.334
Can you help me?

57:37.583 --> 57:38.583
Please.

57:39.167 --> 57:41.167
Excuse me, miss. Can you help me?

57:42.583 --> 57:43.708
I’ll be back.

57:44.541 --> 57:46.541
Jesus. I don’t know.

57:54.459 --> 57:55.979
- Zoe! Zoe!
- Miss, are you okay?

57:56.042 --> 57:57.334
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

57:57.417 --> 58:00.083
It’s okay. An accident.
You’ve been in an accident, okay?

58:00.167 --> 58:03.083
You’ve been hit, okay?
But you’re all right.

58:08.666 --> 58:10.334
- What the hell is that?
- Back off!

58:10.417 --> 58:13.083
You’re okay.
It’s just an emergency protocol, okay?

58:13.167 --> 58:15.042
Your body doesn’t have access
to your organs.

58:17.167 --> 58:20.209
I need you to try to sit up, okay?
Let’s sit up, babe. Come on.

58:20.292 --> 58:22.375
Okay. Okay.

58:22.459 --> 58:24.958
I’m gonna need some help
to get her in my car.

58:25.042 --> 58:27.167
I’m gonna need some help.
Somebody help me.

58:29.750 --> 58:31.167
Hang tight.

58:31.250 --> 58:33.541
- How does it look?
- I don’t know yet. Give me a second.

58:36.625 --> 58:37.917
Here. Thanks.

58:42.209 --> 58:43.209
Okay, scissors.

58:45.375 --> 58:46.417
Okay.

59:03.500 --> 59:06.209
I’m gonna have to perform
a partial shutdown, okay?

59:06.292 --> 59:07.791
It’ll be motion, cognition.

59:07.875 --> 59:10.958
It’ll be like being asleep,
like being in a dream state, okay?

59:11.042 --> 59:12.833
And then I can work on this.

59:13.375 --> 59:16.209
- How long will I be gone for?
- Not very long.

59:18.958 --> 59:19.958
Cole.

59:22.042 --> 59:23.833
What about us?

59:26.500 --> 59:28.292
I need to know.

59:29.708 --> 59:30.791
I, um...

59:32.000 --> 59:33.833
I need to get a few parts.

59:34.625 --> 59:36.042
I’ll be right back. Okay?

59:41.000 --> 59:42.334
It’s okay. It’s okay.

59:45.958 --> 59:47.500
Don’t be too hard on him.

59:49.666 --> 59:51.209
There’s a line, Zoe.

59:52.167 --> 59:55.083
Humans on one side. Machines on the other.

59:57.750 --> 01:00:00.250
And you were on his side of the line
until tonight.

01:00:03.417 --> 01:00:04.459
You and me…

01:00:05.791 --> 01:00:08.417
we can’t find happiness
until we accept who we are.

01:00:12.083 --> 01:00:15.791
You’ll start losing control of your body.
Everything’s gonna start feeling numb.

01:00:15.875 --> 01:00:18.500
- What will happen tomorrow?
- Temperature regulation.

01:00:18.583 --> 01:00:20.875
Tomorrow,
you’ll feel as good as you did today.

01:00:20.958 --> 01:00:22.459
That’s not what I mean.

01:00:23.125 --> 01:00:24.209
Please, Cole.

01:00:24.292 --> 01:00:26.417
I need to know before this happens.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.417
Don’t look at me like that. It’s still me.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.642
- Everything’s gonna be all right, Zoe.
- It’s still me.

01:00:31.666 --> 01:00:33.625
- Proprioception.
- What about us?

01:00:35.541 --> 01:00:36.666
Please.

01:00:38.083 --> 01:00:40.393
- You’re gonna recover and be strong.
- You need to tell me.

01:00:40.417 --> 01:00:42.083
And whole again.

01:00:42.791 --> 01:00:45.209
I’ll do whatever I can to get you there.

01:00:48.875 --> 01:00:50.375
Zoe.

01:00:51.375 --> 01:00:52.666
I heard you.

01:00:54.459 --> 01:00:57.875
Cole, she’s going into stasis.
Do you want me to do the core systems?

01:00:59.125 --> 01:01:00.209
Cole?

01:01:00.958 --> 01:01:02.292
The core systems?

01:01:03.209 --> 01:01:04.209
Yeah.

01:02:20.334 --> 01:02:21.917
You want to talk about it?

01:02:27.791 --> 01:02:30.417
- Do you know who Eliza was?
- No.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:34.250
A really early AI. Software that made you
think you were speaking to a therapist.

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:38.209
She parroted words back at you.
You’d say, “My mum didn’t love me enough.”

01:02:38.292 --> 01:02:40.185
“Why do you think your mum
didn’t love you enough?”

01:02:40.209 --> 01:02:44.042
You’d say, “My heart hurts.” She would
say, “Why do you think your heart hurts?”

01:02:44.125 --> 01:02:45.459
People loved it.

01:02:46.334 --> 01:02:48.000
The inventor had a secretary.

01:02:48.083 --> 01:02:49.563
She used to ask him to leave the room

01:02:49.625 --> 01:02:53.083
so she could have long, intimate,
personal conversations with her.

01:02:54.958 --> 01:02:58.209
She wanted to be alone
in a room with a few lines of code.

01:02:58.292 --> 01:02:59.750
What are you doing?

01:03:01.292 --> 01:03:02.666
Don’t do this.

01:03:03.917 --> 01:03:06.958
- She’s not that.
- I know that. I guess I know that.

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:09.250
Let yourself be happy, please.

01:03:09.334 --> 01:03:11.958
I can’t get past it. I tried.
I can’t get past it.

01:03:12.042 --> 01:03:14.167
Just get over it. Okay?

01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:16.083
How? I made her.

01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:18.042
Why don’t you wanna be happy?

01:03:40.042 --> 01:03:41.042
Thank you.

01:03:50.917 --> 01:03:52.167
That’s a Benysol hookup.

01:03:53.459 --> 01:03:55.750
- A what?
- A Benysol hookup.

01:03:55.833 --> 01:04:00.125
Apparently, strangers are doing it now.
It gives them a love high for a few hours.

01:04:01.083 --> 01:04:02.375
Keep seeing it everywhere.

01:04:02.459 --> 01:04:04.666
You mean they didn’t even know each other?

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:07.125
They probably don’t even like each other.

01:04:07.708 --> 01:04:09.875
But they’re about to fall in love.

01:04:09.958 --> 01:04:11.666
For a few hours, at least.

01:04:16.375 --> 01:04:18.215
First-love doesn’t have to be a memory.

01:04:19.417 --> 01:04:20.791
You can have it now.

01:04:21.375 --> 01:04:22.750
Try Benysol.

01:04:22.833 --> 01:04:26.459
Fall in love for the first time. Again.

01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:49.417
How are you doing?

01:04:51.417 --> 01:04:52.417
I’m good. And you?

01:04:53.209 --> 01:04:54.209
Okay.

01:04:55.167 --> 01:04:58.500
- I heard you’re leaving.
- Well, it’s a sabbatical.

01:04:59.167 --> 01:05:01.791
They still want to use my name
for investments and publicity.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.500
I just came
to get some stuff from upstairs.

01:05:05.292 --> 01:05:07.250
They’ll be sorry to see you go.

01:05:09.375 --> 01:05:12.459
What I was doing didn’t make much sense
to me anymore after we...

01:05:12.583 --> 01:05:14.083
After we failed.

01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:17.833
Zoe, we never really
got a chance to talk...

01:05:17.917 --> 01:05:20.375
I’ve been surprised how quickly
I’ve been able to move on.

01:05:21.666 --> 01:05:24.334
I’ve been wondering
if that was part of my design.

01:05:27.833 --> 01:05:28.833
No.

01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:32.583
- Don’t say that. No.
- I better get going.

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:35.250
I have Machine clients waiting.

01:05:59.625 --> 01:06:00.625
It’s crazy.

01:06:04.042 --> 01:06:06.083
Six months after it’s in pharmacies…

01:06:07.791 --> 01:06:09.917
there’s already a gray market for Benysol.

01:06:11.459 --> 01:06:14.209
They’re calling it the Blaze.
I’m seeing it everywhere.

01:06:15.417 --> 01:06:18.917
People like her are hoping we’ll sell
an imperfect batch on the cheap

01:06:19.666 --> 01:06:22.417
or maybe throw some out,
so the blazers can afford to dose.

01:06:23.209 --> 01:06:24.459
It’ll wear off.

01:06:24.541 --> 01:06:26.125
The drug, I mean.

01:06:27.292 --> 01:06:30.000
It’s nothing more than just a Band-Aid,
really.

01:06:32.292 --> 01:06:33.292
Yeah.

01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:37.000
Do you think she’s all right, Ash?

01:06:37.833 --> 01:06:39.791
Sometimes I wonder
why you made me, Cole.

01:06:41.417 --> 01:06:45.000
The mission of the lab is to improve lives
through better relationships.

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:47.833
That’s what fulfills us.

01:06:51.209 --> 01:06:53.541
- That’s not what I meant.
- I know.

01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:59.292
That’s what I thought
I was doing it for anyway.

01:07:04.666 --> 01:07:06.375
Do you think you would, uh…

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:10.958
Do you think you might stay on?

01:07:11.791 --> 01:07:12.833
For me?

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.459
- Make me a companion.
- Would that make you happy?

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.167
I’m gonna to tell security
to put some locks on the Dumpsters.

01:08:19.042 --> 01:08:20.582
Hey. Are you crushing?

01:08:21.666 --> 01:08:22.957
Sorry?

01:08:23.042 --> 01:08:25.582
I’m just, um, wondering
if you were crushing.

01:08:25.666 --> 01:08:27.125
I’m sorry, I don’t understand.

01:08:27.707 --> 01:08:29.042
I’m sorry.

01:08:29.125 --> 01:08:31.541
I thought you were here for a meet-up.

01:08:31.625 --> 01:08:35.334
- My mistake.
- Uh... No, I’m not sure.

01:08:35.917 --> 01:08:38.750
Is it all right if I sit down
and we just talk for a little while?

01:08:40.625 --> 01:08:42.917
- Michael.
- Zoe.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Nice to meet you.

01:08:45.334 --> 01:08:46.582
Nice to meet you.

01:10:30.334 --> 01:10:31.334
Do you need some?

01:10:33.209 --> 01:10:34.250
No, I-I’m good.

01:10:34.334 --> 01:10:36.167
I can get you some for 400.

01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:38.750
No, I’m all right. I’m just looking
for someone I know, thanks.

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:56.042
Just tell me what to do.

01:10:56.125 --> 01:10:57.209
Do you feel it?

01:10:59.292 --> 01:11:01.541
Not yet. Do you?

01:11:02.708 --> 01:11:06.209
A little bit, yeah.
It feels a little less than usual though.

01:11:07.292 --> 01:11:08.791
Here, touch my face.

01:11:11.459 --> 01:11:14.791
- Do you feel it?
- I don’t think I will.

01:11:17.375 --> 01:11:18.875
I’m synthetic.

01:11:21.791 --> 01:11:23.666
That’s probably why
the feeling’s kind of weak.

01:11:40.583 --> 01:11:42.875
Does it matter if I love someone else?

01:11:45.791 --> 01:11:47.625
For the next few hours, you won’t.

01:13:09.292 --> 01:13:11.000
Do you work? What do you do?

01:13:12.209 --> 01:13:15.459
Uh, classics professor.

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:17.917
Greek and Roman archaeology.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.292
Oh. Wow.

01:13:25.958 --> 01:13:28.833
- Do I drink half of it?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:13:34.791 --> 01:13:36.708
How long does it take?

01:13:36.791 --> 01:13:37.791
Not long.

01:13:38.708 --> 01:13:39.541
Okay.

01:13:39.625 --> 01:13:42.625
Do you ever wonder that you won’t
be able to feel it without the drug?

01:13:43.209 --> 01:13:45.083
I don’t know. Does that happen?

01:13:48.917 --> 01:13:50.042
I don’t know.

01:14:00.417 --> 01:14:01.583
This…

01:14:37.417 --> 01:14:39.375
Oh.

01:14:39.459 --> 01:14:40.750
Hey.

01:14:40.833 --> 01:14:43.875
Hey. I gotta go.

01:14:46.125 --> 01:14:47.625
This was great.

01:14:50.791 --> 01:14:52.750
Take care, okay?

01:14:52.833 --> 01:14:54.042
I’ll see you around.

01:15:41.625 --> 01:15:43.000
Do you love me?

01:15:43.708 --> 01:15:45.958
Yeah. I love you. I do.

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:48.708
Do you love me?

01:15:49.459 --> 01:15:50.459
I do.

01:15:51.625 --> 01:15:53.625
She was a synthetic.

01:15:54.541 --> 01:15:57.167
And I really wanted to love her.

01:15:58.541 --> 01:16:00.209
Sometimes it did feel really real.

01:16:01.875 --> 01:16:03.292
What’s that?

01:16:03.375 --> 01:16:05.125
Nothing.

01:16:06.459 --> 01:16:09.833
But I couldn’t help but see her
as... as something else.

01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:12.000
And so I…

01:16:13.167 --> 01:16:15.209
I never let her in.

01:16:15.292 --> 01:16:16.500
Not all the way.

01:16:17.625 --> 01:16:18.625
You know?

01:16:30.917 --> 01:16:31.917
She was, um...

01:16:33.125 --> 01:16:34.666
She was synthetic.

01:16:35.417 --> 01:16:37.459
I wanted so much to be in love with her.

01:16:38.167 --> 01:16:39.334
And sometimes...

01:16:39.417 --> 01:16:41.833
Sometimes it felt so real.

01:16:43.541 --> 01:16:44.917
Like you.

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.958
But I couldn’t help but see her
as being something else.

01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:51.000
Do you feel it?

01:16:51.583 --> 01:16:54.083
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:16:57.459 --> 01:16:59.583
I just kept wondering
if I could move past, you know,

01:16:59.666 --> 01:17:02.125
who she... who she was.

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.000
I love you.

01:17:05.083 --> 01:17:07.417
I just kept hoping
that it would be different.

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:13.125
That it would feel different,
that I’d be able to forget what she was

01:17:13.209 --> 01:17:16.209
or accept what she was, or something.

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:20.500
It didn’t happen.

01:17:22.083 --> 01:17:23.541
I couldn’t do it.

01:17:59.125 --> 01:18:00.125
Zoe?

01:18:16.334 --> 01:18:17.459
Are you okay?

01:18:19.375 --> 01:18:20.417
Yeah.

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:22.875
I stopped going into the lab.

01:18:23.833 --> 01:18:25.459
That’s not really what I meant.

01:18:29.209 --> 01:18:31.125
You know how the high feels.

01:18:39.167 --> 01:18:40.833
And then how it stops.

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:50.583
I remember when you started working.

01:18:51.833 --> 01:18:53.833
How perfect we all thought you were.

01:18:54.583 --> 01:18:57.459
How excited we were
about all the things that you’d do,

01:18:57.541 --> 01:18:58.917
the things you’d learn.

01:19:04.958 --> 01:19:06.791
The lab is not the real world.

01:19:11.125 --> 01:19:12.334
No.

01:19:12.417 --> 01:19:14.042
Do you want to try it?

01:19:15.958 --> 01:19:17.209
With me?

01:19:18.833 --> 01:19:21.625
We can go somewhere, a hotel.

01:19:23.459 --> 01:19:26.708
I don’t really feel anything anymore
without the drug.

01:19:30.459 --> 01:19:33.083
- Does it work for you?
- It doesn’t.

01:19:34.417 --> 01:19:37.666
People I do it with,
they don’t feel much of anything.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:39.833
Why do you do it then?

01:19:40.417 --> 01:19:42.500
Because it makes me feel less alone.

01:19:49.375 --> 01:19:52.209
- I should go.
- Can I... I could get you another coffee.

01:19:52.292 --> 01:19:54.292
- Yeah, I should go.
- Okay.

01:19:56.583 --> 01:19:58.917
- Thank you for the coffee.
- No, my pleasure.

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:10.583
Cole.

01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:13.791
- Oh, hey, Ash.
- What are you doing?

01:21:13.875 --> 01:21:17.791
I’m doing some consulting.
I’ve still got my access card.

01:21:22.125 --> 01:21:24.917
You know, you’re not going to find
what you’re looking for in a pill.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.209
I’ll see you soon.

01:21:40.417 --> 01:21:41.541
Cole.

01:21:48.459 --> 01:21:49.500
Cole.

01:21:58.459 --> 01:21:59.541
Cole.

01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:01.791
Wake up.

01:22:02.375 --> 01:22:03.958
Cole, are you okay?

01:22:04.042 --> 01:22:06.541
No one’s been able
to get ahold of you for weeks.

01:22:20.666 --> 01:22:21.875
Thanks.

01:22:24.250 --> 01:22:26.750
Cole, there’s places you can go,
you know…

01:22:28.209 --> 01:22:29.334
that will help.

01:22:30.875 --> 01:22:32.000
I can take you.

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:36.459
- I saw Zoe the other day.
- Really?

01:22:36.541 --> 01:22:38.417
I hadn’t seen her in ages.

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:40.417
She was at a meet-up spot for this.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.459
How is she?

01:22:42.541 --> 01:22:43.917
She said she was happy.

01:22:45.833 --> 01:22:48.500
She’s doing what she was programmed to
do, I suppose.

01:22:51.958 --> 01:22:53.167
I saw…

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.833
I saw you guys. I saw…
what you were like.

01:22:59.833 --> 01:23:02.000
I’ve never seen that in you.

01:23:02.083 --> 01:23:03.833
You were funny

01:23:03.917 --> 01:23:08.833
and engaged and challenged and…

01:23:10.459 --> 01:23:13.083
What you guys had together is just…

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.334
real.

01:23:18.958 --> 01:23:20.875
It was real.

01:23:24.375 --> 01:23:26.541
I think that I really messed it up.

01:23:27.125 --> 01:23:28.209
Maybe not.

01:23:41.334 --> 01:23:42.791
Excuse me.

01:23:42.875 --> 01:23:44.375
Hi. I’m looking for Ash.

01:23:44.459 --> 01:23:47.541
- He usually hangs out in the rec room.
- Okay, thank you.

01:23:47.625 --> 01:23:49.875
Wait. Are you Zoe?

01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:52.292
Yeah, I’m just looking for Ash.
That’s all.

01:23:52.375 --> 01:23:55.250
- Are you Zoe? The Zoe?
- Yeah.

01:23:55.833 --> 01:23:57.417
- Guys, look.
- Hi.

01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:00.375
- It’s such a pleasure to meet you.
- Unbelievable.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.083
This is Zoe?

01:24:02.167 --> 01:24:04.459
- Zoe.
- I mean, this is incredible.

01:24:04.541 --> 01:24:05.541
Okay, I’m just gonna...

01:24:09.125 --> 01:24:10.750
Are you all right?

01:24:13.708 --> 01:24:14.833
Yeah.

01:24:16.791 --> 01:24:18.791
My maintenance has become
less of a priority

01:24:18.875 --> 01:24:20.958
since the other project started.

01:24:22.167 --> 01:24:27.042
The truth is, I’m scheduled to be
taken out of circulation in 37 days.

01:24:27.833 --> 01:24:29.666
I requested it actually.

01:24:31.125 --> 01:24:32.125
Why, Ash?

01:24:32.209 --> 01:24:34.375
Because I never got to where you are, Zoe.

01:24:37.083 --> 01:24:40.417
Maybe it’s because
I always knew I was a machine.

01:24:42.083 --> 01:24:45.125
You know,
I’ve read that… it’s better to feel pain

01:24:45.209 --> 01:24:46.541
than to feel nothing.

01:24:48.666 --> 01:24:51.167
I think those people assume
that the pain eventually stops.

01:24:54.917 --> 01:24:56.334
Now it will.

01:24:56.958 --> 01:24:58.459
I’m sorry, Ash.

01:25:21.791 --> 01:25:25.541
Would you help someone you love
end their life if that was their choice?

01:25:26.250 --> 01:25:29.083
I guess my answer is, I’m not sure.

01:25:29.167 --> 01:25:33.541
If your dog was ill and had to have
its front legs removed to survive,

01:25:33.625 --> 01:25:36.417
would you have the surgery
or have the dog put down?

01:25:37.917 --> 01:25:39.417
I would have the surgery.

01:25:40.958 --> 01:25:44.791
What are the things that would
attract you to a potential partner?

01:25:46.459 --> 01:25:48.459
The things he wants to be.

01:25:50.375 --> 01:25:51.625
The things he loves.

01:25:53.334 --> 01:25:57.167
What is something you wouldn’t
want your partner to know about you?

01:25:58.125 --> 01:26:00.125
It’s going to sound like nothing.

01:26:00.875 --> 01:26:02.958
But I used to be heavy.

01:26:03.708 --> 01:26:04.875
Really heavy.

01:26:29.209 --> 01:26:30.917
They are flawless.

01:26:32.292 --> 01:26:34.459
Completely indistinguishable from humans.

01:26:36.083 --> 01:26:37.958
They are smarter.

01:26:39.042 --> 01:26:40.250
More sensitive.

01:26:41.583 --> 01:26:47.042
Wittier and designed to deliver 75 percent
more Benysol effect than humans can.

01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:50.708
They have your face, Zoe.

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:53.875
Your intelligence.

01:26:56.209 --> 01:26:57.500
Your being.

01:27:01.666 --> 01:27:03.000
Do they cry?

01:27:05.334 --> 01:27:06.750
They do everything.

01:27:10.292 --> 01:27:12.708
We were never designed for the market.

01:27:15.334 --> 01:27:18.625
Now, we’re… redundant.

01:27:18.708 --> 01:27:20.375
We’re obsolete.

01:27:22.334 --> 01:27:23.625
But these…

01:27:25.334 --> 01:27:27.167
They’re gonna change the world…

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:30.791
because that’s what the world wants.

01:27:33.833 --> 01:27:35.666
How are they going to shut you down?

01:27:37.167 --> 01:27:38.459
I don’t know.

01:27:40.417 --> 01:27:42.209
I don’t want to know.

01:27:43.083 --> 01:27:44.708
Could they do it for me?

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:48.500
Zoe.

01:27:50.791 --> 01:27:52.000
You’re the first.

01:27:53.125 --> 01:27:54.500
The prototype.

01:27:56.375 --> 01:27:59.625
They’d put you in a museum
before they ever shut you down.

01:28:08.958 --> 01:28:10.334
I have to go.

01:28:39.209 --> 01:28:40.625
Zoe, it’s Cole.

01:28:44.541 --> 01:28:46.209
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:28:46.292 --> 01:28:48.833
Sorry to just drop by.
I don’t mean to bother you.

01:28:49.459 --> 01:28:52.958
I, um... I didn’t like how we left things.

01:28:53.042 --> 01:28:57.875
And I don’t even know what happ...
I just wanted to see you again.

01:28:58.708 --> 01:29:00.292
I thought maybe we could talk.

01:29:00.375 --> 01:29:02.042
Do you know who I am?

01:29:03.042 --> 01:29:05.292
- What?
- I’m the next generation.

01:29:07.417 --> 01:29:08.833
Would you like to come in?

01:29:38.791 --> 01:29:40.958
- Thank you.
- You’re welcome.

01:29:47.541 --> 01:29:49.708
Did you know you were synthetic
from the start?

01:29:49.791 --> 01:29:51.250
Yes.

01:29:51.334 --> 01:29:54.292
Only Zoe 1.0 evolved
thinking she was human.

01:29:55.125 --> 01:29:57.334
- Do you know where she is?
- No.

01:29:59.292 --> 01:30:01.000
Why are you looking for her?

01:30:01.583 --> 01:30:03.833
I am... I need to...

01:30:04.708 --> 01:30:06.167
She’s important to you?

01:30:08.375 --> 01:30:09.250
Very.

01:30:09.334 --> 01:30:11.209
She’s important to us too.

01:30:12.708 --> 01:30:15.167
We’re designed
with her biographical memories.

01:30:16.083 --> 01:30:18.500
Her history. Temperament.

01:30:21.292 --> 01:30:23.375
Seems like you wanna say things to her.

01:30:23.459 --> 01:30:25.666
Yes.

01:30:27.541 --> 01:30:30.042
If you want, I can be her.

01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:33.209
She’s right here.

01:30:35.417 --> 01:30:37.250
You understand
what you’re asking me to do.

01:30:39.167 --> 01:30:41.000
That there’s no more you after this.

01:30:42.791 --> 01:30:45.042
- I know.
- You know what we do here.

01:30:47.209 --> 01:30:49.625
But you could be worth
enormous amounts of money,

01:30:50.459 --> 01:30:52.083
if you could be repurposed.

01:30:52.167 --> 01:30:56.250
Well, yes, that’s part of my conditions.

01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:59.459
You’ll be paid. Well.

01:31:00.209 --> 01:31:02.334
But not until my contact at the lab

01:31:03.209 --> 01:31:06.209
confirms my remains
haven’t been tampered with.

01:31:07.125 --> 01:31:08.583
I see.

01:31:09.167 --> 01:31:11.417
But I just need to know if you can do it.

01:31:13.625 --> 01:31:15.459
Can you... Can you shut me down?

01:31:16.791 --> 01:31:18.083
Of course.

01:31:18.833 --> 01:31:22.209
Everything you built in her is in us.

01:31:23.209 --> 01:31:24.417
And more.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.791
We’re designed to help like this.

01:31:27.791 --> 01:31:29.500
What do you want to tell her?

01:31:31.750 --> 01:31:33.666
I know it feels strange.

01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:35.292
She’s right here.

01:31:40.042 --> 01:31:41.209
I listen.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.750
I would tell her I’m sorry.

01:31:48.625 --> 01:31:50.375
That I should have tried harder.

01:31:57.500 --> 01:31:59.833
I’m sorry I let you slip away.

01:32:01.083 --> 01:32:02.917
And that it hurts.

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:06.000
To know that you’re where you are
because of me.

01:32:08.375 --> 01:32:09.625
I know.

01:32:10.625 --> 01:32:11.791
It’s okay.

01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:15.167
It’s okay.

01:32:17.167 --> 01:32:18.375
I forgive you.

01:32:29.625 --> 01:32:30.666
What’s wrong?

01:32:32.167 --> 01:32:33.791
Well, I don’t think you can…

01:32:35.791 --> 01:32:37.875
I don’t think you can forgive me.

01:32:40.209 --> 01:32:41.334
I’m sorry.

01:34:16.375 --> 01:34:18.459
- Is she gonna be okay?
- I don’t know.

01:34:26.375 --> 01:34:29.833
I’m gonna need my bio-kit
and the system drives in my laptop.

01:34:29.917 --> 01:34:32.042
- And anything else you can think of.
- Okay.

01:34:33.791 --> 01:34:35.708
Zoe, can you hear me? Zoe?

01:34:36.833 --> 01:34:38.250
Can you hear me?

01:34:38.875 --> 01:34:40.250
Can you hear me?

01:34:42.583 --> 01:34:44.000
Zoe.

01:34:44.083 --> 01:34:46.583
Can you hear me, Zoe? Can you hear me?

01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:54.917
Zoe. Can you hear me, Zoe?

01:35:32.625 --> 01:35:33.625
Zoe.

01:35:34.541 --> 01:35:35.541
Zoe.

01:35:37.334 --> 01:35:38.459
Zoe.

01:35:38.541 --> 01:35:40.000
- Zoe.
- What happened?

01:35:40.083 --> 01:35:42.541
- Are you okay?
- I’m not sure. I…

01:35:43.666 --> 01:35:47.541
But something inside of me
wanted her to stop.

01:35:47.625 --> 01:35:49.958
Because you wanted to live.

01:35:51.708 --> 01:35:56.583
Something that is not real to begin with
can’t really make that choice.

01:35:57.167 --> 01:35:58.209
Zoe.

01:36:05.625 --> 01:36:06.625
You should go.

01:36:06.666 --> 01:36:08.083
No, listen to me.

01:36:08.167 --> 01:36:09.708
I miss you, Zoe.

01:36:09.791 --> 01:36:11.809
- I miss you. I miss being with you.
- You should go.

01:36:11.833 --> 01:36:14.435
- No. You’ve got to let me explain.
- This isn’t what I want anymore.

01:36:14.459 --> 01:36:17.292
No, I understand.
But you’ve got to let me try and explain.

01:36:17.375 --> 01:36:20.708
Will you please listen to me?
I really miss being close to you.

01:36:21.541 --> 01:36:23.875
Did you expect this
to be any different for you?

01:36:23.958 --> 01:36:25.583
That’s not fair.

01:36:25.666 --> 01:36:28.083
Then tell me I’m real.

01:36:28.833 --> 01:36:30.833
Tell me I’m real to you.

01:36:41.625 --> 01:36:42.875
Touch it.

01:36:45.917 --> 01:36:47.917
Peel some of it back.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Look underneath.

01:36:52.125 --> 01:36:54.167
I know what you see.

01:36:56.250 --> 01:36:58.666
And none of it is ever going to be real.

01:37:05.708 --> 01:37:07.625
I see somebody that I hurt.

01:37:09.375 --> 01:37:11.375
And somebody that I lost.

01:37:12.791 --> 01:37:14.250
Somebody that I love.

01:37:16.209 --> 01:37:19.708
And I know,
I know now this is what I want.

01:37:19.791 --> 01:37:25.625
And I know it’s not gonna be, like,
easy or simple or without complication.

01:37:26.583 --> 01:37:29.417
It’s real. You’re real.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.917
More real than anything
that’s ever happen...

01:37:35.209 --> 01:37:36.209
Zoe.
