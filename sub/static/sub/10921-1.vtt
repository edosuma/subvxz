Amanda!

01:12.109 --> 01:13.406
Thanks, Benny!

01:14.978 --> 01:16.878
Thank you very much.
Have a good day.

01:19.149 --> 01:20.912
Hi, T.J. Hi, Molly.

01:20.951 --> 01:22.009
Hi, Amanda.

01:22.052 --> 01:23.519
Hi, Amanda.
How was your week?

01:23.554 --> 01:26.079
A little slow, but it'll pick up.

01:26.123 --> 01:27.215
So, what's good today?

01:27.257 --> 01:29.282
The blackberries are very nice.

01:30.270 --> 01:31.570
[Raspberries.]

01:31.695 --> 01:35.529
Actually, I could use a pound
of raspberries, please.

01:35.566 --> 01:36.931
[Thank you.]

01:41.104 --> 01:43.095
Good morning, Abe.
Charlie, Welcome back.

01:43.140 --> 01:46.732
Thanks. Hey, I'm sorry to hear
about you guys closing out.

01:47.811 --> 01:48.591
What?

01:48.631 --> 01:50.511
Do you have any idea
what you gonna do now?

01:51.248 --> 01:52.772
What did you smack me for?

01:52.816 --> 01:56.445
Business is a little slow but
we're not closing.

01:56.487 --> 01:58.717
He is confused.

01:58.755 --> 02:01.555
You know, I got some nice shiitakes
over here. You should look at them.

02:02.626 --> 02:03.803
Where did all the portobellos go?

02:03.827 --> 02:06.489
They're gone.
Valderon wanted them.

02:06.663 --> 02:08.631
Oh, good, you spotted him.

02:08.664 --> 02:10.257
Never even heard of him.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.495
Not Valderon, the other one.

02:12.536 --> 02:14.197
What...

02:14.238 --> 02:16.030
I don't remember seeing you
here before.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.238
Are you always here?

02:17.274 --> 02:21.408
Well, only when absolutely necessary.
It's a long trip.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.276
These are for you.

02:23.313 --> 02:24.940
Peekytoes. Marvelous.

02:24.982 --> 02:26.950
I wouldn't know
what to do with a crab.

02:26.984 --> 02:29.674
But thanks anyway. Bye.

02:36.627 --> 02:39.289
Weren't you just over there?

02:39.329 --> 02:43.197
It's always important to remember
that the wind from one door closing

02:43.233 --> 02:44.495
opens another.

02:44.535 --> 02:46.833
Pick my crabs, Amanda.

02:46.870 --> 02:49.532
Your mother wants you to
start living up to your potential.

02:49.573 --> 02:51.040
My mother is dead.

02:51.074 --> 02:52.701
Now, that's no reason
to ignore her.

02:53.777 --> 02:55.210
Open your nose!

02:55.245 --> 02:57.372
He was very unpleasant.

02:57.414 --> 02:59.348
Well, 59 dollars.

03:05.355 --> 03:07.755
Oh, don't let that one get away!

03:16.770 --> 03:17.970
Got you!

03:18.570 --> 03:19.870
Oh, no.

03:20.670 --> 03:21.870
Hi.

03:22.105 --> 03:26.098
I'm sorry, but something
is about to crawl up your pants.

03:29.947 --> 03:32.102
You may think
I'm some kind of freak

03:32.142 --> 03:35.242
but I was just
trying to help you.

03:35.986 --> 03:38.254
- Jesus!
- Sorry.

03:38.788 --> 03:41.555
- Frisky little guy.
- Not for long.

03:42.095 --> 03:43.825
He is gonna be lunch in my restaurant.

03:43.860 --> 03:45.122
Really?

03:45.162 --> 03:47.320
Yeah. I'm making something.

03:47.835 --> 03:49.700
Something very...

03:50.540 --> 03:51.933
Napoleonic.

03:52.073 --> 03:53.665
Crab Napoleon, actually.

03:54.675 --> 03:58.004
- Should be very special.
- Special.

03:59.646 --> 04:00.945
I'm sure it will be.

04:02.082 --> 04:04.194
You don't look like you're
in the restaurant business.

04:04.218 --> 04:07.119
- No? Why not?
- The suit.

04:07.154 --> 04:09.434
- Are you?
- No. Well, I...

04:09.474 --> 04:11.919
Yes, I'm starting
a restaurant that's about to open.

04:11.959 --> 04:15.520
And as a matter of fact
I just lost my chef.

04:15.562 --> 04:18.156
And it looks like
you've misplaced your crustacean.

04:18.197 --> 04:20.325
- It was a pleasure to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

04:20.365 --> 04:22.028
Good luck.

04:22.069 --> 04:23.900
You too.

04:23.937 --> 04:26.201
Look Am, I found
your little wandering friend.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.265
Now, don't go
leaving these behind.

04:28.308 --> 04:30.840
Oh, goodness. Oh, god.

04:31.340 --> 04:33.037
Why did I buy these?

04:33.080 --> 04:35.514
I'm Gene O'Reilly.
It's been nice meeting you.

04:41.388 --> 04:42.782
Oh, your change!

04:56.837 --> 04:57.837
Hey.

04:58.839 --> 05:00.363
I made you some coffee.

05:00.407 --> 05:02.932
Thanks.
Ow, those are heavy.

05:02.976 --> 05:04.443
What are you doing with those?

05:04.478 --> 05:06.940
Don't ask.
I had the weirdest morning.

05:06.980 --> 05:07.940
Really?

05:07.980 --> 05:09.576
First I met this guy,
Gene O'Reilly.

05:09.616 --> 05:11.679
He said he was a friend of mom's.
Do you know him?

05:11.719 --> 05:13.779
Gene O'Reilly...

05:13.820 --> 05:16.282
No, I don't think so.
It doesn't ring a bell.

05:16.322 --> 05:18.114
I think he was a crazy person.

05:19.892 --> 05:22.656
And then Charlie asked me how I felt
about us closing.

05:24.063 --> 05:25.325
He's back, huh?

05:26.099 --> 05:27.830
So, did he asked you out?

05:28.140 --> 05:31.159
Tia Stella, stop changing
the subject.

05:34.106 --> 05:36.734
We agreed to run
this restaurant together.

05:38.511 --> 05:39.511
Okay.

05:41.247 --> 05:44.375
The new landlord's
raised the rent.

05:44.417 --> 05:47.580
We're not making it, sweetie,
we have it for some time.

05:47.620 --> 05:49.485
How much did he raised the rent?

05:49.522 --> 05:51.615
To 5000 dollars a month.

05:51.657 --> 05:54.182
- 5000? He can't do that.
- Well, he did.

05:55.094 --> 05:58.154
So, then we can go to a bank
and get a loan.

05:58.197 --> 06:01.492
I've already tried that and
the way things are going,

06:01.534 --> 06:03.968
the bank doesn't have the faith
that we can pay it back.

06:04.003 --> 06:07.268
But we've been here 70 years.

06:11.477 --> 06:13.775
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry, Amanda.

06:13.813 --> 06:15.446
No, it's my fault.

06:15.586 --> 06:17.272
Come on, what is
that they always say?

06:17.316 --> 06:19.944
That the wind from one door slamming
opens another?

06:19.985 --> 06:23.580
- What?
- Did I say it wrong?

06:23.622 --> 06:26.216
I'm not very good with proverbs,
you know.

06:26.992 --> 06:30.553
Come on, let's go get something to eat.
I'm starving.

06:38.838 --> 06:41.600
Ever since Henri Bendel
first opened in New York,

06:41.640 --> 06:44.870
Bendel's stood as New York's
most elegant store for women.

06:44.910 --> 06:47.635
Now, Henri's grandson, Jonathan
continues that tradition

06:47.675 --> 06:51.038
with the first four-star luxury
restaurant ever in a department store.

06:51.140 --> 06:52.970
After an exquisite meal
at Jonathan's,

06:53.010 --> 06:54.840
our guests will have
the run of the store.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.616
It's a whole new approach to
fine dining and shopping.

06:57.790 --> 06:59.682
You'll see next week.
Thank you all for coming.

06:59.722 --> 07:01.154
Excuse me, I've heard

07:01.194 --> 07:03.728
you spent 4 million dollars
on a 75 seat restaurant.

07:03.762 --> 07:04.956
That's a heavy gamble.

07:04.997 --> 07:07.659
Well madam, it's not a gamble
if you have the right ingredients.

07:07.700 --> 07:09.531
Again, thank you all.

07:10.202 --> 07:11.202
- Tom...
- Yes?

07:11.440 --> 07:13.100
There is a very thin girl

07:13.140 --> 07:15.250
- in your office making herself at home.
- Oh, Christ, that's Chris.

07:15.274 --> 07:17.369
Now, Lois, what is she doing
in my office without me?

07:17.409 --> 07:19.976
I don't know. But I
offered her a sandwich.

07:20.016 --> 07:21.880
With butter and jelly.

07:26.619 --> 07:27.619
Chris.

07:29.054 --> 07:32.353
I just downloaded my schedule
onto your computer.

07:32.391 --> 07:34.188
I hope you were using a condom.

07:34.226 --> 07:36.057
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

07:37.396 --> 07:39.887
I'll see you at lunch.

07:39.932 --> 07:41.832
- Lunch.
- Goodbye.

07:46.972 --> 07:51.003
Oh my god.
She did it in red.

07:51.043 --> 07:54.479
Sharing your cyberspace.
That's a big step for you, Tom.

07:54.513 --> 07:57.726
You know, I was actually gonna take her
to a nice lunch today and just break up with her.

07:57.750 --> 08:00.548
- We've had three dates.
- Getting too heavy for you?

08:00.586 --> 08:03.282
No, I just know
exactly where it's going.

08:03.322 --> 08:04.448
Look at this.

08:04.490 --> 08:06.856
This is happiness over time.

08:06.892 --> 08:08.154
You keep track of this?

08:08.193 --> 08:11.959
Yeah. You see after the third date
happiness drops precipitously.

08:11.997 --> 08:14.227
It's because first
everyone's very well mannered.

08:14.266 --> 08:16.632
No one really expects
anything to happen.

08:16.669 --> 08:20.029
By the fourth date it becomes a relationship
at which point it becomes a minefield

08:20.069 --> 08:23.029
of these secret meanings
and these unmet expectations and...

08:23.776 --> 08:28.007
Lois, look at this: we've had three dates,
she's downloading her schedule.

08:28.047 --> 08:30.229
Like, you know, they start questioning
"When is he gonna marry me?"

08:30.253 --> 08:31.430
"What are our kids
gonna look like?"

08:31.454 --> 08:33.861
And I am thinking, you know,
"Don't spend every weekend with her"

08:33.885 --> 08:36.197
and if I spend too much time at the office
is she gonna get suspicious?

08:36.221 --> 08:39.782
And it becomes a round
of these fights and making up,

08:39.825 --> 08:41.535
when at first it was just...

08:41.576 --> 08:42.587
fun.

08:42.626 --> 08:44.325
I believe you've overlooked something.

08:44.363 --> 08:48.197
The information you need, Tom,
is what you do after date three

08:48.233 --> 08:51.202
that makes every one
so miserable.

08:51.340 --> 08:52.669
What I do?

08:52.705 --> 08:55.196
No. Don't touch that.
Put that down. Put it down.

08:56.909 --> 08:59.309
Your airplane fetish
is starting to worry me.

08:59.345 --> 09:03.679
In 1961 Howard Hughes flew
a paper airplane

09:03.716 --> 09:05.577
from the Golden Nugget
to the Sands.

09:05.617 --> 09:06.840
It was 4.2 miles.

09:07.886 --> 09:10.548
One of these days
I'm gonna break that record.

09:10.589 --> 09:13.649
It's all in the adjustable
sweep-back of the wings.

09:13.692 --> 09:15.091
Look at that.

09:15.127 --> 09:18.688
Wasn't Howard Hughes the guy
who never got out of his pajamas?

09:19.832 --> 09:21.631
No, that's Hugh Hefner.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.567
John Starks is the man.

09:23.602 --> 09:24.967
He do 9 elbows last night.

09:25.004 --> 09:26.972
Okay, shut up. Come here.

09:27.006 --> 09:28.006
Taste this.

09:34.680 --> 09:38.116
- It's good.
- You do realize you can't lie?

09:38.150 --> 09:39.640
Oh, it stinks.

09:39.685 --> 09:42.051
It tastes like blue cheese and dirt.

09:42.087 --> 09:45.079
There is only one thing
that tastes worse than blue cheese and dirt.

09:45.124 --> 09:46.489
Rum raisins.

09:47.860 --> 09:51.956
Look... I'm really sorry we have to close.

09:53.265 --> 09:56.257
We can get jobs
in another restaurant.

09:56.301 --> 09:59.031
Sure, we can take our own ad
if we can afford it.

09:59.071 --> 10:03.633
"Situation wanted: Shitty chef and sous-chef
seek restaurant to ruin".

10:05.244 --> 10:08.442
Shitty chef and...

10:08.780 --> 10:09.780
We need a prayer.

10:09.815 --> 10:11.204
Here we go.

10:11.984 --> 10:13.561
Will you have any dessert today, Howard?

10:13.585 --> 10:15.815
Oh, I can't.
I got my cholesterol results.

10:15.854 --> 10:17.287
Oh, you don't wanna know.

10:17.322 --> 10:19.552
All I can say is,
no more desserts, Howie.

10:19.591 --> 10:20.717
I know.

10:20.759 --> 10:22.556
- Hi everybody.
- Hi.

10:22.594 --> 10:26.496
Big news. "La bodega",
on the corner, evicted.

10:26.532 --> 10:29.262
I've never liked that guy anyway.

10:29.301 --> 10:32.464
Well, at least we've still
got a place to eat lunch, huh?

10:33.272 --> 10:37.902
Uh... actually...
there's something I wanna tell you.

10:37.943 --> 10:38.943
I can't believe...!

10:38.977 --> 10:40.777
We'll never get a cab
at this time of the day.

10:41.781 --> 10:43.974
The cell phone!

10:44.116 --> 10:46.816
This is awful, I don't like it.
I don't understand it.

10:46.852 --> 10:49.612
That's terrible.
Where am I gonna eat my lunch?

10:50.989 --> 10:53.082
Bill, you don't like the food anyway.

10:53.125 --> 10:55.389
I love that cheesy chicken.

10:55.427 --> 10:58.089
Howard, be honest.

10:58.130 --> 10:59.825
You're not here for the food either.

10:59.865 --> 11:02.240
Don't give up, it's too soon.
You'll get better.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.735
We love you, Amanda.

11:05.938 --> 11:07.633
I love you, guys.

11:07.673 --> 11:11.734
You're a loyal, wonderful people and

11:11.777 --> 11:17.181
you deserve a 'Southern Cross'
like it used to be, when mom was here.

11:20.452 --> 11:24.411
I try but
I'm not my mom.

11:25.691 --> 11:26.691
I'm sorry.

11:51.984 --> 11:56.444
...for too many years.
Just do it! What?

11:56.488 --> 11:58.922
...until Thursday,
I need a phone call.

11:58.957 --> 12:00.549
Thank you very much.
No, not you.

12:00.592 --> 12:01.592
Excuse me!

12:02.209 --> 12:04.187
Where are we?
This isn't Chanterelles.

12:04.229 --> 12:05.473
Do I have to do everything for you?

12:05.497 --> 12:07.294
Excuse me! You're a cab!

12:09.835 --> 12:12.626
Oh, wait honey. You know what?
It's that way, honey.

12:15.407 --> 12:16.596
You!

12:17.876 --> 12:19.468
Oh, god.

12:19.511 --> 12:20.876
Not now.

12:22.981 --> 12:24.915
Perfect, a little person.

12:26.485 --> 12:27.747
Listen, do you know where...?

12:27.786 --> 12:29.276
- Hello.
- Hi.

12:29.321 --> 12:30.583
Do you two know each other?

12:31.590 --> 12:34.559
Her crab bit me this morning.

12:34.593 --> 12:35.593
Really?

12:36.428 --> 12:39.226
Do you know where
this restaurant is, Chanterelles?

12:39.264 --> 12:42.594
- Sure, it's two blocks that way.
- No, no.

12:43.001 --> 12:45.069
We're here.
We might as well just eat.

12:45.109 --> 12:47.733
Besides, I feel like a little crab.

12:47.773 --> 12:50.173
A little bad crab. It's so unfair.

12:51.810 --> 12:55.473
Well, lunch is sort of over.
Forever.

12:56.582 --> 12:58.946
- So you're just teasing me?
- What?

12:59.084 --> 13:00.612
This morning in the market...

13:00.652 --> 13:03.246
With the Crab Napoleon and the souffle...

13:03.288 --> 13:04.722
It sounded amazing.

13:04.723 --> 13:05.723
Thank you.

13:06.691 --> 13:10.286
Do you have a menu
that we could look at?

13:11.162 --> 13:12.162
Of course.

13:18.236 --> 13:20.363
That's one more humiliation.

13:28.980 --> 13:30.311
Right this way.

13:39.324 --> 13:41.884
Two new customers.

13:41.926 --> 13:43.757
Maybe it's a sign.

13:45.296 --> 13:46.820
Oh my god.

13:46.865 --> 13:48.662
- He's here.
- Who?

13:48.700 --> 13:50.167
The guy from the market.

13:50.201 --> 13:53.793
I told him that I can make Crab Napoleon
with pommes... something

13:53.838 --> 13:56.139
and he's showed up.

13:56.174 --> 13:58.233
Well, just tell him
we're out of here.

13:58.276 --> 14:00.608
No, tell him we've closed.

14:00.645 --> 14:02.513
- I can't do that.
- Now, I tell him.

14:02.582 --> 14:05.247
No! Then he's gonna leave.

14:05.283 --> 14:07.012
Now, that's the idea,
isn't it?

14:07.051 --> 14:09.679
No! I want him to stay.

14:09.721 --> 14:14.540
Then we're just gonna have to make the
Crab Neopolitan... Napalm...

14:14.580 --> 14:16.552
- Napoleon.
- Whatever.

14:17.061 --> 14:18.061
How?

14:21.399 --> 14:23.799
You better go find
one of your mom's recipes.

14:24.236 --> 14:27.927
Okay, I'll just...
I'll go upstairs now.

14:34.846 --> 14:36.438
Crab Napoleon.

14:37.482 --> 14:40.178
This is gonna suck.

14:40.218 --> 14:42.618
Well, if she's ever
gonna find her inspiration,

14:42.654 --> 14:44.645
please, let it happen now.

14:54.199 --> 14:56.740
Hey. So, did you found a recipe?

14:56.780 --> 14:58.063
Oh, no.

14:58.937 --> 15:01.098
But I found these
in my mom's box.

15:01.139 --> 15:03.369
Wow. Those are nice.

15:03.408 --> 15:05.706
Hey, maybe we can sell them
and pay the rent.

15:05.743 --> 15:07.711
Nolan, they are my mom's.

15:08.646 --> 15:12.477
- No. So, crabs... Boiled?
- Yeah.

15:15.186 --> 15:17.177
So, how did you hear about us?

15:17.222 --> 15:18.587
Sorry that took so long.

15:18.623 --> 15:20.784
It'll just be here
in a couple of minutes.

15:20.825 --> 15:22.349
Will you both be having the crab?

15:22.393 --> 15:24.054
- Please.
- No.

15:24.095 --> 15:29.533
Listen, I was wondering if you could just do
a very simple Chicken Paillard.

15:31.803 --> 15:34.181
One Chicken Paillard
for the mistake he's with.

15:34.221 --> 15:36.000
Girls like that
really get to me.

15:36.041 --> 15:38.735
- But she's perfect for him.
- No, she's not.

15:38.775 --> 15:40.110
Check the hair.

15:40.144 --> 15:42.635
Every strain in place,
just like his.

15:43.748 --> 15:45.682
I can fix my hair.

15:45.717 --> 15:48.049
Not like that. You can't, Amanda.

15:48.086 --> 15:50.680
So, she has perfect hair.
Big deal.

15:50.722 --> 15:52.166
No, it's not just the hair,
it's the skin.

15:52.190 --> 15:55.284
She's got that kind of skin.
It's silky, like butter.

15:55.326 --> 15:57.487
It's called makeup and,
Nolan, you're not helping.

15:57.528 --> 16:00.497
You've got to be born with that kind of skin.
And check out the sharp suit.

16:00.531 --> 16:02.328
She trippin' far,
she cut her leg off.

16:02.367 --> 16:05.768
- And look at the shoes!
- Nolan, shut up! Okay?

16:05.803 --> 16:08.271
You're wrong.
He's not happy with her.

16:08.306 --> 16:09.636
He couldn't be happy

16:09.676 --> 16:12.607
with somebody with perfect skin
and perfect hair

16:12.643 --> 16:15.976
and perfect wardrobe with
goddamned matching shoes.

16:16.016 --> 16:19.276
And if you can't see that,
then I feel sorry for you.

16:19.317 --> 16:21.717
Inevitably she'll self-destruct.

16:22.720 --> 16:27.987
I'm just under a little stress today,
that's all. But I can handle it.

16:28.026 --> 16:29.755
If you say so.

16:31.029 --> 16:33.429
Okay. Now.

16:34.299 --> 16:38.736
We are going to make
the most delicious Crab Napoleon.

16:38.770 --> 16:40.795
Where is the recipe?

16:40.838 --> 16:42.897
I told you I couldn't find one.

16:42.941 --> 16:44.465
But we'll improvize.

16:44.509 --> 16:47.376
Just bring me...
everything we have.

16:47.412 --> 16:49.107
Everything we have.

16:49.147 --> 16:51.012
And the crabs, are they cooked?

16:51.049 --> 16:54.450
The crabs... are dead.

16:55.453 --> 16:57.284
There's nobody here, honey.

16:57.322 --> 16:59.688
Well, it's late for lunch.

16:59.724 --> 17:02.625
So... "Cleveland".

17:09.166 --> 17:10.862
Can I interest you in a martini?

17:12.136 --> 17:13.364
Not for me.

17:13.404 --> 17:14.803
No, thank you.

17:19.810 --> 17:23.804
You know, just once
I'd like to make something really great.

17:24.949 --> 17:32.949
Just have everything come together so perfectly
that just one bite is ecstasy.

17:36.060 --> 17:39.291
Did you ever noticed
how many words there are for "delicious"?

17:40.999 --> 17:42.364
Savory,

17:43.368 --> 17:44.630
tasty,

17:45.670 --> 17:47.763
scrumptious,

17:47.805 --> 17:49.295
delightful,

17:50.108 --> 17:51.336
succulent,

17:52.577 --> 17:54.238
mouth-watering...

17:56.839 --> 17:59.339
Huh... Nolan?

18:00.218 --> 18:01.218
Wow! Freaky!

18:01.252 --> 18:03.846
People that we don't know
want their food.

18:05.556 --> 18:07.353
Where did that come from?

18:07.392 --> 18:09.451
I don't know.

18:09.494 --> 18:10.494
Gorgeous.

18:12.440 --> 18:13.440
Yeah.

18:14.365 --> 18:15.423
You know, Chris,

18:16.434 --> 18:20.234
I've been thinking a lot lately
about us and...

18:20.271 --> 18:21.568
Me too.

18:21.606 --> 18:24.541
- I already feel closer to you.
- You do?

18:25.211 --> 18:29.705
Yeah. With us merging
our schedules and all,

18:29.747 --> 18:31.271
I'll always know where you are.

18:31.315 --> 18:33.749
Oh, my god!

18:33.785 --> 18:34.785
Do you think he likes it?

18:44.162 --> 18:45.288
Are you okay?

18:48.132 --> 18:50.600
I think so.
You're such a controlling asshole.

18:50.635 --> 18:51.635
What?

18:53.504 --> 18:54.994
I'm sorry.

18:55.039 --> 18:56.870
I don't know why I just said that.

18:56.908 --> 18:59.399
Me either.
You should really try this.

18:59.444 --> 19:01.139
It's succulent. It's...

19:01.179 --> 19:04.806
- Tommy?
- It's absolutely delectable. This...

19:04.947 --> 19:05.705
Tommy?

19:05.716 --> 19:07.183
I can't hear.

19:07.218 --> 19:10.551
- What am I doing with someone like you?
- Me?

19:10.588 --> 19:14.820
I mean... Me! With my perfect hair!

19:14.859 --> 19:16.121
What is she doing?

19:20.998 --> 19:22.727
I hate this place.

19:24.936 --> 19:26.699
Chris, what are you doing?

19:26.737 --> 19:27.897
Excuse us.

19:27.939 --> 19:30.336
I have perfect skin.
Perfect.

19:32.810 --> 19:34.940
- I think she's on something.
- Your food.

19:34.980 --> 19:37.671
I've decided that you are a waste

19:39.450 --> 19:42.010
of my perfect wardrobe

19:42.753 --> 19:45.722
with matching shoes.

19:46.690 --> 19:49.091
Chris, no one is that perfect.

19:52.096 --> 19:53.154
I am.

19:53.197 --> 19:55.158
And if you can't see that, I...

19:58.903 --> 20:00.837
feel sorry for you.

20:01.773 --> 20:02.773
Excuse me.

20:10.515 --> 20:11.573
Look at this!

20:13.518 --> 20:14.951
None of these plates match.

20:17.288 --> 20:19.552
No, Chris...

20:29.600 --> 20:31.090
I love this jacket.

20:31.135 --> 20:32.295
It's nice.

20:33.304 --> 20:34.304
Bye bye.

20:36.974 --> 20:39.772
Thank you so much.

20:40.912 --> 20:42.345
Everybody okay?

20:44.515 --> 20:47.450
She's got quite a temper there.

20:47.485 --> 20:51.546
Not usually, it must be the
curse of the fourth date.

20:52.857 --> 20:54.848
Just a theory of mine.

20:54.892 --> 20:57.554
I'm very sorry about this,
I'll be happy to replace everything.

20:57.595 --> 20:59.106
What was in this?
My name is Tom, by the way. Deal?

20:59.130 --> 21:01.428
- Tom Dill?
- Tom Bartlett. Did you use dill?

21:01.466 --> 21:03.597
- Like the pear.
- Send me the bill.

21:05.903 --> 21:07.564
- Rhymes with "dill", doesn't it?
- Yes.

21:08.906 --> 21:09.906
I will.

21:10.908 --> 21:12.168
That was a good one.

21:12.208 --> 21:14.248
I can't believe this happened.
This is very bizarre.

21:14.280 --> 21:16.480
Very sorry. I said that, didn't I?

21:16.514 --> 21:20.280
I should really go, I think.

21:20.318 --> 21:22.309
Here is my card.

21:22.353 --> 21:24.913
If you call me,
I'll replace the dishes and

21:26.157 --> 21:27.522
the meal.

21:28.659 --> 21:30.820
What is your name?

21:30.861 --> 21:32.852
Amanda. Shelton.

21:48.314 --> 21:49.740
- Tom...
- Lois

21:49.814 --> 21:52.044
What happened to you?
My god!

21:52.083 --> 21:55.416
I just had
the most incredible lunch.

21:55.453 --> 21:57.717
Too bad you didn't get
any of it in your mouth.

21:57.755 --> 21:59.655
No, no, no.
This is Chris's Lunch.

21:59.690 --> 22:01.351
She didn't take it too well, huh?

22:01.392 --> 22:02.791
She completely freaked out.

22:02.827 --> 22:07.594
And then she dumped me.
Which would have normally upset me

22:07.632 --> 22:12.064
if it wasn't for those
amazing crab things

22:12.104 --> 22:13.240
that made me feel...

22:13.640 --> 22:15.831
But you wanted to break up with her.

22:15.873 --> 22:19.309
No, Lois. I have feelings.
She treated me like I was nothing.

22:19.343 --> 22:22.073
I don't even know
if she have ever even really liked me.

22:23.848 --> 22:27.614
You know, she might have
just been using me.

22:28.552 --> 22:31.817
That's just terrible.

22:35.192 --> 22:38.355
I want to speak to the council
senior
as soon as the meeting is over.

22:38.396 --> 22:40.489
No, wait! How do I look?

22:40.531 --> 22:42.021
Come on, Lois. It's been two years.

22:42.066 --> 22:44.500
Jonathan is not biting.
You really should move on.

22:44.535 --> 22:46.696
I can't help it.
He makes me crazy.

22:46.737 --> 22:48.568
What do you see that I don't?

22:48.606 --> 22:49.971
It's his hands.

22:50.007 --> 22:52.601
They drive me wild.
I want them all over me.

22:52.643 --> 22:54.235
Come on, help me out.

22:54.278 --> 22:56.246
Every man has his weakness.
What's his?

22:56.280 --> 22:58.271
Jonathan's?
It's easy, immortality.

22:58.272 --> 22:59.992
His, not his grandfather's.
That's his flaw.

23:00.773 --> 23:02.773
Immortality?

23:09.528 --> 23:13.025
- Nice of you to join us.
- Sorry I'm late. Please, go on.

23:13.064 --> 23:16.266
Fine! Tom, you wanna tell me
why you spent 100.000 dollars

23:16.306 --> 23:17.967
on a floor that makes me dizzy?

23:18.402 --> 23:20.802
Place doesn't even look
like a restaurant.

23:20.838 --> 23:22.863
It's like something out of a MGM musical.

23:22.907 --> 23:25.205
Well, exactly. It is a stage for a fantasy

23:25.242 --> 23:28.439
and this floor will create the mood.
Sort of like a crab can...

23:31.282 --> 23:33.512
Jonathan's will be
the grandest restaurant in New York.

23:33.551 --> 23:36.213
It will be "Jonathan's".
And we want it to be lavish

23:36.253 --> 23:40.155
and sometimes you have to go the extra money
to get the extra dill... dollar.

23:40.191 --> 23:42.250
I don't like the sound of this.

23:43.260 --> 23:44.921
Have I ever let you down?

23:44.962 --> 23:48.693
Not yet. But you're young.
Very young.

23:48.733 --> 23:51.924
And don't forget. By exporting Jonathan's
to seven chains around the world

23:51.968 --> 23:54.066
there'll be Jonathan's everywhere.

23:54.105 --> 23:55.834
Royalties rolling in, articles about you

23:55.873 --> 23:58.842
in Vanity Fair, the Times...

23:58.876 --> 24:01.572
Not Henry. You.

24:01.612 --> 24:04.809
You will be immortal.

24:08.285 --> 24:09.946
I like you, Lois.

24:11.489 --> 24:13.150
You're like a man.

24:13.190 --> 24:15.158
You think with your nuts.

24:17.061 --> 24:18.528
Thank you, Jonathan.

24:18.562 --> 24:20.189
Alright, let's move on.

24:20.231 --> 24:21.231
Show me the fall catalog.

24:23.968 --> 24:26.860
I think I got all of the pieces
out of the floor.

24:26.900 --> 24:29.793
These pieces were embedded
in a chair over there between two customers.

24:30.074 --> 24:32.167
Nolan, what do you think?

24:33.043 --> 24:35.409
Look delicious.
What about it?

24:39.150 --> 24:41.812
Amanda, I don't think so

24:41.852 --> 24:43.479
but let's find the sugar cookies.

24:43.521 --> 24:46.456
Oh, thanks for the confidence.

24:46.490 --> 24:47.821
Go away.

25:27.698 --> 25:28.892
She did it!

25:30.134 --> 25:31.897
Something weird is going on.
Amanda!

25:32.903 --> 25:34.302
I'm upstairs, Nolan.

25:37.541 --> 25:40.408
I'm in here.
And hands off the dolls.

25:41.509 --> 25:42.509
How is this?

25:43.410 --> 25:44.510
For what?

25:44.511 --> 25:47.480
Buying plates.
Uptown.

25:47.518 --> 25:49.418
Rewind.

25:49.453 --> 25:51.683
Tom offered
to buy us plates.

25:51.722 --> 25:53.849
It would be rude not to accept.

25:54.040 --> 25:55.427
Oh, Tom!

25:56.227 --> 25:58.127
We have to have plates.

25:58.162 --> 26:02.098
I think that psycho chick from yesterday,
she left at least three, right?

26:02.132 --> 26:05.761
That's Ruth, Howard and Bill.
Three. We're safe.

26:05.803 --> 26:07.763
- How is this?
- No.

26:09.673 --> 26:13.575
Okay, so, when I get there,
what do I talk to him about?

26:13.611 --> 26:16.670
You saw him and you know me and
you know how I tend to run on when I get nervous.

26:16.671 --> 26:18.692
And I know I'm gonna be nervous
in a place like that.

26:18.716 --> 26:21.316
Amanda, relax. Just be yourself.

26:26.091 --> 26:27.718
No. What? Please!

26:27.758 --> 26:31.027
See? This is what I'm afraid of.

26:31.061 --> 26:33.052
Come on, Nolan, help me.

26:33.097 --> 26:36.933
I mean, you're a guy, right?
What are guys interested in?

26:36.968 --> 26:39.734
- Sex.
- Sex?

26:39.770 --> 26:41.829
I can't talk about sex.

26:42.907 --> 26:45.432
Well, there's sports cars and money...

26:45.476 --> 26:48.274
No, we only think about sex.

26:48.312 --> 26:51.907
No, that can't be right. There has to be
something else we can talk about.

26:51.949 --> 26:53.610
Yeah, I saw that on Dateline.

26:53.651 --> 26:57.712
The average man
thinks about sex 238 times a day.

26:58.722 --> 27:01.290
That means they
think about sex all day.

27:01.324 --> 27:02.951
Pretty much.

27:02.992 --> 27:04.721
Maybe that applies to you.

27:04.761 --> 27:06.058
Pretty much.

27:06.095 --> 27:09.155
Look, you know how guys
are always adjusting their belts?

27:09.199 --> 27:10.325
Oh, don't tell me this.

27:10.366 --> 27:13.335
Nolan, stop! I'm not listening.

27:13.369 --> 27:14.847
Well, that's when
they're thinking about it.

27:14.871 --> 27:16.338
Check it out for yourself.

27:16.372 --> 27:18.670
Oh, my god.
Why did you tell me this?

27:18.708 --> 27:21.805
Now every time I see somebody doing that
it's gonna be in my head. Forever.

27:21.845 --> 27:22.735
Thank you.

27:22.775 --> 27:23.940
You asked.

27:24.948 --> 27:27.007
- Well, I gotta go.
- Wait.

27:31.721 --> 27:32.721
Really?

27:35.291 --> 27:36.724
Yeah, yeah, that one.

28:11.995 --> 28:13.484
- Ramos
- Tom

28:14.740 --> 28:16.659
- No, no, no.
- What?

28:17.433 --> 28:19.645
Round ones should stay on the top,
square ones on the bottom.

28:19.669 --> 28:21.330
Oh. See?

28:21.371 --> 28:26.040
Wait, wait! Don't adjust. Never.
Just admire.

28:27.510 --> 28:29.842
That's beautiful.

28:29.879 --> 28:33.014
- Gook job, man!
- Thanks, thanks.

28:33.049 --> 28:34.840
God, what would I do
without you?

28:39.856 --> 28:42.154
Excuse me. Hi.

28:42.992 --> 28:46.223
Do you know where
I can find Tom Bartlett?

28:46.224 --> 28:47.224
Yeah, he was just here.

28:48.940 --> 28:50.140
There he is.

28:51.540 --> 28:52.727
Thank you.

28:57.640 --> 28:58.800
I owe you.

28:58.841 --> 29:01.207
No, I'll just grab this last one and...

29:01.244 --> 29:03.405
Please let it lie.

29:03.446 --> 29:05.437
No, I'm sorry.

29:05.481 --> 29:07.449
If you just allow me
I think I can...

29:07.483 --> 29:09.178
Sorry.

29:10.787 --> 29:12.414
Please, please let me...

29:13.856 --> 29:15.255
Hi.

29:15.291 --> 29:17.919
Oh, no. Ramos will take care of this.
Have Laura help you.

29:17.960 --> 29:18.960
Thanks.

29:21.230 --> 29:22.993
I guess this makes us even.

29:24.901 --> 29:28.530
Yeah, I guess you could call this even.

29:28.571 --> 29:29.571
I'm really sorry.

29:29.672 --> 29:31.765
No, no. It's a nice coincidence.

29:31.808 --> 29:34.440
- Do you shop here a lot?
- Me? No. Never.

29:37.447 --> 29:40.541
I thought you said you'd
replace the plates.

29:40.583 --> 29:43.143
Didn't you? That's why I'm here.

29:43.186 --> 29:45.245
Sure, I thought you'd send the bill.

29:45.288 --> 29:47.222
Don't you sell plates?

29:47.256 --> 29:49.850
Yeah. China is on fourth floor.

29:49.892 --> 29:52.588
And do all these elevators
go to fourth?

29:52.628 --> 29:55.188
Pick one, press four.

29:55.231 --> 29:56.596
Right.

29:57.600 --> 29:58.692
Thanks.

29:58.735 --> 29:59.963
You're welcome.

30:01.637 --> 30:03.662
- Sorry.
- Don't worry about that.

30:05.074 --> 30:07.700
There is a beautiful new line,
from Italy...

30:07.740 --> 30:11.940
- It's really... it's beautiful.
- What?

30:11.980 --> 30:13.892
Facing this way it'll be on the top
shelf. It'll be on your right.

30:13.916 --> 30:16.214
I can't hear you.

30:18.654 --> 30:20.986
Never mind, I - I'll show you.

30:30.800 --> 30:32.062
Four...

30:35.138 --> 30:38.301
That'll be quite a color clash
in your restaurant.

30:38.341 --> 30:40.571
Oh, I cannot afford it anyway.

30:40.610 --> 30:42.168
I'm really sorry
about yesterday. I...

30:42.211 --> 30:45.044
Don't worry about that.
It happens all the time.

30:46.549 --> 30:48.540
Is your girlfriend okay?

30:48.584 --> 30:51.712
I think so.
Yeah, she is fine.

30:51.754 --> 30:53.881
She is not my girlfriend
any more but...

30:53.923 --> 30:56.824
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be. It was time.

30:56.859 --> 30:59.327
Were you going out for a long time?

30:59.362 --> 31:02.024
No, not really.

31:02.064 --> 31:03.861
I have no idea what
came over, actually.

31:03.900 --> 31:09.133
She's usually so collected and calm.
It was odd.

31:09.172 --> 31:11.252
You didn't do anything
to provoke her, did you?

31:11.292 --> 31:12.972
No. Did you?

31:16.078 --> 31:18.840
Okay, I'll take eight
of those on that table,

31:18.940 --> 31:20.243
these here,

31:20.282 --> 31:22.940
and the ones
on the shelf over there, please.

31:22.980 --> 31:23.980
Eight of each?

31:24.086 --> 31:25.654
That's too many.
Oh, I can take less.

31:25.694 --> 31:28.314
No, no, no.
That's - that's fine. Perfect.

31:28.354 --> 31:33.627
Helen, if you please make a note of eight
each of the Susan, the Orange and the Lily.

31:33.663 --> 31:37.064
And I'll sign
if you just give me the bill.

31:37.100 --> 31:39.034
- Thanks.
- You're very welcome.

31:42.405 --> 31:43.405
Thank you.

31:45.742 --> 31:47.733
I'll make sure
that you get these by tomorrow.

31:47.777 --> 31:48.777
Thank you.

31:48.811 --> 31:52.076
Very bold plate selection, I might add.

31:52.115 --> 31:53.342
It explains the outfit.

31:53.743 --> 31:57.143
To eliminate the necklace
would take in another half hour.

31:57.244 --> 32:00.544
- I see.
- Doesn't look like it takes you very long.

32:00.545 --> 32:03.945
Touche, I do seem to come out of the shower
fully dressed in a blue suit.

32:04.427 --> 32:06.892
- And a belt.
- No, actually I don't wear a belt.

32:07.728 --> 32:10.797
- Really?
- No. Why?

32:11.600 --> 32:13.398
Never mind.

32:13.436 --> 32:16.132
Never mind? What...
No, no, wait a minute.

32:16.172 --> 32:17.867
What - what do you mean?

32:17.907 --> 32:20.068
So. How long have you worked here?

32:20.109 --> 32:22.955
Three years. But you can't ask me something
so ridiculous as whether or not wearing belt

32:22.979 --> 32:24.356
and not tell me,
why you wanna know.

32:24.380 --> 32:26.405
I don't really...

32:26.449 --> 32:28.417
I knew this was gonna happen.

32:28.451 --> 32:32.148
My friend, Nolan, told me
this thing about men and sex.

32:32.188 --> 32:34.383
That they think about it
238 times a day

32:34.424 --> 32:37.393
and when they do,
they play with their belt.

32:37.427 --> 32:39.418
That's ridiculous.

32:39.462 --> 32:41.930
No, no, not the belt.

32:41.964 --> 32:43.090
I wasn't...

32:43.132 --> 32:45.528
No, I'm thinking about the amount.

32:45.568 --> 32:48.066
It's ridiculous... It's...
Do the math.

32:48.104 --> 32:50.231
I'm awake maybe 17 hours a day
times 60,

32:50.273 --> 32:54.336
would be...
1020 divided by 238...

32:54.377 --> 32:59.212
that would be sex
about every four minutes and...

33:01.085 --> 33:04.212
Yeah, that's quite right, actually.

33:05.488 --> 33:08.889
- I have been here 20 minutes.
- Right.

33:10.827 --> 33:11.953
Right.

33:11.994 --> 33:13.621
That's impossible.

33:13.663 --> 33:15.563
Yeah. Why?

33:15.598 --> 33:18.726
What - what's impossible?

33:18.768 --> 33:23.705
One good sexual though
takes at least 20 minutes.

33:23.740 --> 33:25.037
Is that right?

33:26.976 --> 33:29.308
Excuse me.
Mr. Bartlett?

33:29.345 --> 33:32.212
Your secretary just called and
the Wilkinson meeting started.

33:32.248 --> 33:34.307
Yeah, 20 minutes ago, yeah.
Thank you.

33:37.053 --> 33:40.079
- I should really get back to work.
- Me too.

33:43.326 --> 33:44.793
I'll walk you to the elevator.

33:46.362 --> 33:48.557
That's an interesting sweep back.

33:50.767 --> 33:52.735
How do you know so much
about paper airplanes?

33:52.769 --> 33:54.464
I hated algebra.

33:54.504 --> 33:56.631
Of course you did...

33:56.672 --> 33:58.333
Does it fly?

33:58.374 --> 34:02.105
Yes, it does.
However usually not where intended to.

34:02.145 --> 34:06.340
For example, right now,
we're going for that bucket.

34:16.659 --> 34:20.389
It doesn't fly well
but it does fly with purpose.

34:23.733 --> 34:26.257
- Ramos, that looks beautiful.
- Thanks.

34:27.570 --> 34:29.561
You know, I'm really glad
you came up.

34:29.605 --> 34:30.902
I am too.

34:30.940 --> 34:33.373
And you never told me,
what was in that Crab Napoleon.

34:33.476 --> 34:34.841
Oh, I almost forgot.

34:35.511 --> 34:37.411
Your lunch came with dessert.

34:37.446 --> 34:40.176
- Dessert?
- I love dessert.

34:40.216 --> 34:42.241
It's the whole point of the meal.

34:50.260 --> 34:52.222
Beautiful, Graham.

34:57.200 --> 34:58.599
Wow, this...

35:03.940 --> 35:05.134
Do you like it?

35:08.578 --> 35:09.636
This is...

35:10.847 --> 35:12.678
This is very good.

35:15.551 --> 35:17.485
This is very, very good.

35:22.358 --> 35:23.916
Have you met Brian?

35:23.960 --> 35:25.860
Brian is in shoes.

35:25.895 --> 35:27.988
It's nice to meet you.

35:28.030 --> 35:29.088
My pleasure.

35:29.966 --> 35:31.593
I love shoes.

35:31.634 --> 35:33.067
Me too, Mr. Bartlett.

35:33.102 --> 35:34.467
I love that we sell shoes.

35:34.503 --> 35:35.814
I love that we sell them in twos.

35:35.838 --> 35:38.102
It's so... Noah's Ark.

35:40.343 --> 35:41.343
Thank you, Brian.

35:42.478 --> 35:43.578
Change of plans.

35:43.579 --> 35:46.179
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. God! Have one of these.

35:46.449 --> 35:47.939
Where are we going?

35:47.984 --> 35:49.110
You're gonna love this.

35:55.424 --> 35:57.187
I'm feeling sort of loopy.

35:59.795 --> 36:02.787
This is... you're a chef.

36:02.832 --> 36:04.197
You'll love this.

36:07.370 --> 36:08.894
Man can do many things

36:08.938 --> 36:11.202
but only God can create the truffle.

36:11.240 --> 36:12.571
What's he doing?

36:12.608 --> 36:14.906
He is out of his noodle.

36:14.944 --> 36:17.412
Okay, let him alone.

36:25.354 --> 36:28.346
And this is the actual restaurant itself.

36:28.991 --> 36:30.253
It's incredible.

36:31.627 --> 36:33.390
It certainly will be.

36:33.429 --> 36:37.024
But these are amazing.

36:37.066 --> 36:38.829
The way it starts in your mouth and

36:38.868 --> 36:42.668
it travels to your brain
and it shoots down your spine

36:42.705 --> 36:46.163
and then explodes out of your toes...

37:06.128 --> 37:08.358
Am I interrupting something?

37:14.971 --> 37:16.336
Hello!

37:52.737 --> 37:54.437
Bartlett?

38:05.438 --> 38:07.438
Bartlett?

38:10.024 --> 38:13.016
The Wilkinson group
wants to see the restaurant.

38:13.061 --> 38:15.621
What are you doing?
Interviewing waitresses? Come on.

38:15.663 --> 38:17.995
Right. One minute.

38:22.937 --> 38:25.997
I'm sorry, but I really have to go now.

38:28.042 --> 38:29.669
Come on, I'll show you out.

38:29.710 --> 38:31.109
Don't worry about it.

38:31.145 --> 38:32.703
I can find my way.

38:35.083 --> 38:37.643
That was fun,
wasn't it?

38:40.254 --> 38:44.520
Which means that it probably
would be fun again.

38:44.559 --> 38:47.187
Logically. Would make sense.

38:49.230 --> 38:50.390
I'll call you.

38:51.732 --> 38:52.732
You will?

38:54.068 --> 38:55.296
Of course I will.

39:52.226 --> 39:56.322
Much more fun shooting paper airplanes,
than setting with the bankers.

39:56.364 --> 39:57.797
I wish I had thought of it.

39:57.832 --> 40:01.495
I can't believe I forgot.
The restaurant's really got me distracted.

40:04.071 --> 40:05.561
I'm glad you brought that up.

40:06.240 --> 40:09.539
I had a dream. I wanted to tell you about it.

40:10.545 --> 40:12.479
In it I'm wearing a tuxedo.

40:14.749 --> 40:19.613
I could see the reflection of my
grandfathers face in my patent leather shoes.

40:21.789 --> 40:24.383
It was the opening of Jonathan's.

40:25.459 --> 40:28.053
I was having a wonderful time.

40:28.095 --> 40:29.062
That's great. I know you will...

40:29.096 --> 40:31.099
Except...

40:31.100 --> 40:32.900
Every time I looked down

40:34.035 --> 40:35.866
in my shoes

40:37.438 --> 40:40.407
Henry was sticking his tongue out at me.

40:46.013 --> 40:48.447
Why do you think he was doing that?

40:49.884 --> 40:52.478
I really don't know, Jonathan.

40:52.520 --> 40:55.748
- It's disturbing me.
- Right.

40:59.827 --> 41:01.954
I want you to keep thinking about it.

41:04.398 --> 41:05.956
I know I will be.

41:12.073 --> 41:14.469
He said he'd call.
What do you think he meant?

41:14.509 --> 41:18.545
Does it mean today,
or tomorrow, or next week...?

41:18.579 --> 41:22.099
We're gonna have to get somebody else.
Aunt Stella can't handle the floor alone any more.

41:22.783 --> 41:25.013
I can't make all
those at once.

41:25.052 --> 41:27.111
Hey, you wanted business,
you got it.

41:31.759 --> 41:33.957
There's a juicy rumor
going around about you.

41:33.997 --> 41:36.223
- I'm trying to kill it, of course.
- Thank you.

41:36.264 --> 41:38.960
Don't you wanna know what it's about?
Good, I'll tell you.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.558
It's about you and a girl.

41:40.601 --> 41:43.729
In flagrante, up in the restaurant.

41:43.771 --> 41:45.033
In flagrante?

41:45.072 --> 41:46.801
We were dancing, Lois.

41:46.841 --> 41:50.174
Ooh, Dancing! Even better.
That's so sweet.

41:50.211 --> 41:52.076
At least I think we were dancing.

41:52.113 --> 41:54.707
It was very weird.
I wasn't myself.

41:54.749 --> 41:58.241
I felt like I was someone else.
Someone... romantic.

41:58.286 --> 41:59.446
How nice for you.

41:59.487 --> 42:01.648
But I definitely wasn't myself.

42:01.689 --> 42:03.247
It's definitely a brush off.

42:03.291 --> 42:05.589
He got back together
with the perfect girl.

42:05.626 --> 42:09.756
Amanda, if I hear about him one more time, I swear
I'm gonna cut off my ears and mail them to him.

42:09.797 --> 42:12.027
Just call him yourself.

42:12.066 --> 42:14.796
No, I can't call.
I have never called a guy.

42:15.035 --> 42:16.593
I'd scare him.

42:18.606 --> 42:20.369
What are you doing?

42:20.408 --> 42:21.670
Please, don't do that.

42:21.709 --> 42:23.836
Yes. Bendel's department store, please.

42:25.846 --> 42:29.077
- But I'm fine. It was very weird though.
- What's her name?

42:29.116 --> 42:31.141
- Amanda Sh...
- Amanda Shelton on line one, Tom.

42:31.185 --> 42:32.185
That's scary.

42:33.340 --> 42:35.140
Pick it up.

42:38.794 --> 42:42.057
- Hello?
- Hey, Tom. It's Amanda.

42:42.096 --> 42:46.355
I just wanted to... eat...

42:46.356 --> 42:49.356
I mean, invite you to eat dinner
tonight at the restaurant.

42:49.638 --> 42:52.305
Tonight?
Let me check my schedule.

42:58.279 --> 43:00.645
I've got a dinner meeting,
that starts at eight.

43:00.681 --> 43:01.841
No, you don't.

43:01.882 --> 43:04.279
Okay. Well, huh...

43:05.286 --> 43:07.777
I'll be here late,
if you wanna maybe stop by afterwards.

43:07.822 --> 43:09.949
Sure, if it's not too late.

43:09.990 --> 43:12.390
Okay, well, maybe I'll see you

43:12.426 --> 43:13.950
some time.

43:13.994 --> 43:15.961
- Bye.
- Bye bye.

43:18.666 --> 43:19.860
Thanks, Nolan.

43:19.967 --> 43:23.061
You're a very bad boy.

43:23.104 --> 43:24.867
Very bad.

43:25.907 --> 43:28.705
So, the guy can't come tonight.

43:28.743 --> 43:30.040
Maybe another night.

43:49.196 --> 43:51.061
Are you the chef?

43:51.098 --> 43:53.110
No, sir. I'm the sous-chef.
Why? Is there a problem?

43:53.134 --> 43:54.431
Are you kidding?

43:54.468 --> 43:56.163
This food is incredible.

43:56.203 --> 43:59.400
In fact, I wanna do
the whole thing all over again.

43:59.440 --> 44:01.908
Are you sure about this, sir?

44:01.943 --> 44:06.773
Yeah! Only this time I'll have
the dessert first and work my way back.

44:07.615 --> 44:11.210
Okay, well, if you keep it up
we may have to back you out of here.

44:22.496 --> 44:24.396
We got 100 dinners tonight.

44:26.000 --> 44:31.028
I don't know what got into you,
but the food is great.

44:31.072 --> 44:32.198
Thanks.

44:32.239 --> 44:34.867
Fear is a great motivator.

44:34.909 --> 44:38.276
I'm not so sure it's fear.

44:38.312 --> 44:41.713
Well, whatever it is,
it's a cause for celebration.

44:41.749 --> 44:43.307
Let's go dancing.

44:44.151 --> 44:46.309
I think you're
on your own tonight.

44:46.310 --> 44:48.110
- You sure?
- Oh, yeah.

44:49.123 --> 44:51.114
Yes, I'm sure.

44:54.261 --> 44:56.422
I don't think he's coming, Amanda.

44:57.765 --> 44:59.130
I'm not waiting.

45:03.871 --> 45:06.362
There's a lot of magic
in the air, Amanda.

45:19.520 --> 45:21.351
Hi!

45:21.389 --> 45:22.389
Hi.

45:23.057 --> 45:24.888
It's really late.

45:25.260 --> 45:28.158
Yeah, I got really tied up and...

45:28.195 --> 45:30.629
Yeah, It was as always so busy here.

45:30.665 --> 45:32.326
A party of of six
just wouldn't leave.

45:32.366 --> 45:34.561
I finally had to
kick them out at midnight.

45:34.602 --> 45:37.571
That's great.
Or else I'd missed you.

45:38.406 --> 45:40.237
You must be exhausted.

45:40.708 --> 45:43.299
Yeah, those guys come on and on.

45:44.311 --> 45:45.676
I brought you these.

45:45.713 --> 45:47.647
- They're...
- Vanilla orchids.

45:49.717 --> 45:50.843
I hardly ever see these.

45:54.689 --> 45:58.356
- What?
- You. Smelling those flowers.

45:59.326 --> 46:02.454
- Can I walk you home?
- Sure.

46:07.201 --> 46:08.201
Thank you.

46:10.004 --> 46:11.004
It's here?

46:13.441 --> 46:14.441
All my life.

46:16.777 --> 46:20.543
- Thank you for the flowers.
- You're welcome.

46:22.083 --> 46:25.140
So, I guess this is where we
pretend we had dinner and say "good night".

46:26.387 --> 46:31.347
We can pretend we had dinner.
But did we have dessert?

46:31.392 --> 46:32.859
I'm still hungry.

46:32.893 --> 46:35.527
If you know a place that's open,
I'd love to get some dessert.

46:36.740 --> 46:38.890
- Okay.
- Okay?

46:55.583 --> 46:56.948
So, what was your meeting about?

47:00.921 --> 47:02.115
I lied.

47:02.890 --> 47:04.323
There was no meeting.

47:07.595 --> 47:10.428
I don't know
why I'm telling you this.

47:10.464 --> 47:12.728
I guess cause I'm sorry.

47:14.468 --> 47:15.692
It's okay.

47:16.040 --> 47:17.057
I understand.

47:19.206 --> 47:21.674
My last table left at eleven.

47:21.709 --> 47:24.502
- Great.
- So I'm sorry too.

47:24.503 --> 47:25.703
Now I really feel bad.

47:25.980 --> 47:29.313
Oh, don't. Because then I'm gonna
feel bad for making you feel worse.

47:29.350 --> 47:31.784
And I'll feel worse,
for making you feel bad twice.

47:33.320 --> 47:34.878
Okay, I think we're both sorry.

47:34.922 --> 47:36.583
We're both sorry.

47:59.146 --> 48:00.636
That smell...

48:03.017 --> 48:05.383
Smelling flowers.

48:28.375 --> 48:29.808
It's incredible!

48:44.058 --> 48:45.457
The taste

48:45.492 --> 48:47.289
is so good.

48:50.631 --> 48:52.189
It's amazing.

48:56.370 --> 48:59.931
It's sweet and a little spicy.

49:32.842 --> 49:34.740
Ramos...

49:35.740 --> 49:38.769
- Oh, Tom, I've been looking for you.
- These orchids, these vanilla...

49:40.214 --> 49:42.114
We need more of these.

49:42.149 --> 49:43.727
In fact I want them all over the floor
for the party.

49:43.751 --> 49:45.776
Okay, but we bought 2000 roses...

49:45.819 --> 49:49.812
No, no, it doesn't matter.
I want the whole place to smell like vanilla.

49:49.857 --> 49:51.697
Okay. But here's one for you.
There's a problem..

49:51.721 --> 49:53.840
Valderon won't work.
He won't come in.

49:53.880 --> 49:55.384
What? Why?

49:55.429 --> 49:56.760
Air France lost his knives.

49:56.797 --> 49:58.532
Ramos, give him some new knives.

49:58.565 --> 50:01.192
He doesn't want new ones,
he wants his.

50:01.234 --> 50:03.065
Ramos, nobody quits over knives.

50:03.102 --> 50:05.332
Give him some knives,
give him many knives.

50:05.371 --> 50:06.804
Just take care of it.

50:17.784 --> 50:20.218
I'm impressed, Mr. Bartlett.

50:20.253 --> 50:22.380
The design is wonderful.

50:22.422 --> 50:25.482
But I have to tell you,
I'm skeptical.

50:25.525 --> 50:28.323
The start-up cost
was higher than projected

50:28.361 --> 50:31.489
and Valderon is
a difficult man, you know.

50:31.531 --> 50:33.328
Yes, he is. However.

50:46.079 --> 50:47.674
About the cost report...

50:47.714 --> 50:50.912
many one-time-only fees...

50:50.950 --> 50:53.885
Such as our delicious design...

50:55.355 --> 50:57.880
Mouth-watering market research...

51:01.561 --> 51:04.353
Appetizing ad campaign...

51:04.964 --> 51:06.056
Excuse me.

51:21.514 --> 51:24.108
- Are you eating?
- Oh, no.

51:24.417 --> 51:26.977
- It's this new fragrance that we've got.
- No, no, it's not.

51:27.020 --> 51:29.250
I think it is...

51:51.544 --> 51:53.944
Amanda didn't told us
it was so expensive.

51:54.880 --> 51:55.438
Excuse me!

51:55.581 --> 51:56.912
Excuse me.

51:56.949 --> 51:59.649
- Are you carrying food?
- Yes, but...

52:04.624 --> 52:07.491
I'm sorry. I'm going to
have to confiscate that.

52:07.527 --> 52:09.085
It's a new store policy...

52:09.128 --> 52:13.292
That's no outside food,
due to the rats.

52:13.332 --> 52:14.799
Thank you.

52:14.834 --> 52:17.699
Boy, ...dangerous.

52:45.366 --> 52:49.000
- What... Lois!
- You have to learn to share, Tom.

52:49.836 --> 52:50.570
This is good.

52:50.610 --> 52:53.963
Actually this is
kind of incredible.

52:54.006 --> 52:55.335
- Got any more?
- No?

52:55.775 --> 52:56.975
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

52:57.509 --> 52:59.773
Man, this is good!

53:04.283 --> 53:06.911
I wish Jonathan was around.

53:06.953 --> 53:10.411
Where did you get this thing!
My god!

53:10.456 --> 53:14.187
You know, Lois, I mugged
a 75-year-old woman for these.

53:14.227 --> 53:15.990
Lois, I'm loosing it!

53:17.964 --> 53:20.023
I can't quit thinking about her.

53:20.066 --> 53:21.397
We kissed

53:22.401 --> 53:25.131
in a vanilla cloud.

53:25.171 --> 53:27.469
Vanilla? You did well.

53:27.507 --> 53:29.031
Amazing, this girl.

53:30.042 --> 53:35.503
She's beautiful, she's smart,
she's funny, she...

53:36.315 --> 53:38.010
And she can cook!

53:38.050 --> 53:41.349
Lois, she can cook things
that make you crazy.

53:41.387 --> 53:43.582
Lois, it's chaos.

53:44.657 --> 53:46.488
It's a bit soon.

53:46.526 --> 53:49.051
It's only our second date.

53:49.095 --> 53:50.687
Oh, what a date it was!

53:50.730 --> 53:52.823
More like a third actually.

53:52.865 --> 53:57.165
It feels like a lifetime
with these amazing dates.

53:57.203 --> 53:59.433
And she made this fog, Lois.

53:59.472 --> 54:01.963
It was warm, it was wet...

54:02.008 --> 54:05.842
It was like
you could see what we were feeling.

54:05.878 --> 54:07.505
This is it, Tom.

54:07.547 --> 54:09.674
You'd better run.
Specially now.

54:09.715 --> 54:11.277
You don't have time for this.

54:11.417 --> 54:14.145
I know.
Look at me, I'm chasing pastry, Lois.

54:14.420 --> 54:15.820
I don't even eat desserts.

54:15.821 --> 54:18.521
You're a wreck. She's got you all
tangled up in your underwear.

54:18.561 --> 54:20.785
Whatever you do,
don't see her again.

54:20.826 --> 54:23.624
No, absolutely not.
I can't. I...

54:24.631 --> 54:25.959
I'm gonna tell her in person...

54:26.060 --> 54:27.460
No way, too risky.
Use the phone.

54:27.700 --> 54:30.168
No, Lois.
I do this all the time.

54:30.203 --> 54:33.070
- I can handle this.
- Not this time!

54:33.105 --> 54:36.032
- No, Lois. Do you think I would succumb?
- I don't think it. I know it.

54:36.077 --> 54:39.067
No, Lois, trust me.
I'll go down there after work,

54:39.111 --> 54:41.671
I'll sit down calmly,
I'll have a bite.

54:41.714 --> 54:43.511
Everything will be fine.

54:43.549 --> 54:44.777
Just watch.

54:46.252 --> 54:48.049
It'll be my pleasure.

54:49.240 --> 54:50.540
Mr. Bartlett...

54:50.580 --> 54:53.354
Herr Müller!
Sorry I have kept you waiting.

55:03.035 --> 55:04.035
Annie,

55:04.770 --> 55:07.000
I need you to get downtown
as fast as you can

55:07.039 --> 55:10.133
to this restaurant called
the 'Southern Cross'

55:10.176 --> 55:15.478
and get me as many
caramel eclair thingies as possible.

55:15.514 --> 55:16.776
Hurry.

55:26.759 --> 55:29.555
- Come on.
- I don't usually...

55:34.667 --> 55:36.756
Oh, god!
Oh, Jonathan!

55:40.740 --> 55:42.040
Tom...

55:55.355 --> 55:57.447
Amanda, here's a guest.

55:59.325 --> 56:01.085
Hey, I didn't expect
to see you here tonight.

56:03.029 --> 56:06.521
Amanda, I need to talk to you
just for a minute.

56:06.565 --> 56:09.160
Sure, but it's a bad time right now.
Could it be a bit later?

56:09.301 --> 56:10.598
Yes, sure.

56:10.636 --> 56:12.797
I asked the chef to
give you a few plate.

56:12.838 --> 56:15.898
Oh, wait! Hold on!
The mussels are ready.

56:15.941 --> 56:17.465
Please.

56:17.510 --> 56:18.943
One more, here.

56:37.830 --> 56:39.957
So, what is that
you wanted to talk to me about?

56:43.402 --> 56:45.393
You're an amazing cook.

56:47.073 --> 56:50.133
Yeah, well, up until last week,
I couldn't cook anything.

56:50.943 --> 56:53.275
Well I find that hard to believe.

56:53.312 --> 56:56.338
I tried but
nothing ever worked.

56:57.650 --> 56:59.413
Suddenly it all came together.

56:59.452 --> 57:01.443
It's like anything else.
It's like...

57:01.487 --> 57:04.418
when you learn to ride a bicycle.
The first nine times you fall off

57:04.458 --> 57:06.824
and the 10th time
you just... ride for a mile.

57:09.161 --> 57:10.161
I guess.

57:12.198 --> 57:13.666
That's what I feel like.

57:13.799 --> 57:15.164
A little crab salad.

57:15.200 --> 57:18.169
You know, I just don't think
he is your normal crab.

57:18.203 --> 57:21.195
He is a bit odd.

57:21.240 --> 57:23.640
- How about a dessert instead?
- Sure.

57:43.362 --> 57:47.423
That's a very,
very good knife.

57:48.333 --> 57:50.301
Never used to be this good.

57:52.838 --> 57:56.001
Enjoy a good
aerodynamic phenomenon.

57:57.341 --> 57:58.205
It's like your airplane.

57:58.244 --> 58:00.440
That was a draft
from the air conditioner.

58:00.480 --> 58:03.480
- And the band?
- There was a band, wasn't there?

58:05.617 --> 58:08.444
The band was
hallucination from the eclairs.

58:09.588 --> 58:10.856
It was some sort of sugar rush.

58:10.990 --> 58:13.783
And we both had the same one?

58:13.826 --> 58:20.356
No. There's something going on here
and I can't explain it.

58:20.399 --> 58:22.060
It's starting to scare me.

58:26.138 --> 58:29.164
No, see. This is exactly
how we're supposed to feel.

58:29.208 --> 58:32.405
I mean, a bit light headed
and distracted.

58:32.444 --> 58:34.878
But our senses sort of perk up.

58:34.913 --> 58:38.246
It's a "deja vu".
It's vivid.

58:38.283 --> 58:42.014
It's very vivid, actually.
But it's not real.

58:46.492 --> 58:50.053
That's really, really good.

58:55.269 --> 58:59.594
Amanda, you've just
become a great cook.

58:59.638 --> 59:01.606
That's not magic.

59:01.640 --> 59:02.902
It's talent.

59:04.510 --> 59:05.841
Pure and simple.

59:07.045 --> 59:08.342
Thank you.

59:09.114 --> 59:10.809
What was I thinking?

59:27.500 --> 59:30.960
I love kissing you.

59:31.003 --> 59:32.493
I love you too.

59:34.140 --> 59:38.334
What - wh - wh
what's going on here?

59:38.377 --> 59:39.844
We're floating!

59:39.878 --> 59:42.209
Make it stop!
Make this stop!

59:42.681 --> 59:48.347
- But it's amazing.
- No. This is not amazing! It's scary.

59:50.389 --> 59:52.340
- When can I get down?
- Don't get hysterical.

59:52.380 --> 59:54.559
I'm not hysterical, Amanda!

59:54.593 --> 59:55.890
I'm trapped.

59:55.928 --> 59:59.329
Look, you did this to me
so just undo it.

59:59.364 --> 59:59.991
Please?

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.540
I didn't do anything!

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:03.011
You are responsible,
don't you think?

01:00:03.035 --> 01:00:04.696
Just figure it out, please!

01:00:04.736 --> 01:00:06.765
Right. The ending secret, of course.

01:00:06.805 --> 01:00:08.800
What do you wanna hear?
Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo!

01:00:08.841 --> 01:00:11.332
Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo...
That's not funny!

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:24.147
- I better go.
- Why?

01:00:24.187 --> 01:00:26.319
I kissed you and you...

01:00:26.359 --> 01:00:28.349
- I was...
- What?

01:00:28.994 --> 01:00:31.253
Tom, what? Please,
I don't understand!

01:00:31.293 --> 01:00:33.375
I'm not gonna stick around
to see what else you can do to me.

01:00:33.399 --> 01:00:35.611
- Are you scared of me?
- Oh, yes, I'm scared of you, Amanda.

01:00:35.635 --> 01:00:37.235
Every time I'm around
things just happen.

01:00:37.266 --> 01:00:38.993
And you're the one
calling all the shots.

01:00:39.033 --> 01:00:43.167
I don't need this
flavored fog and floating stuff.

01:00:43.208 --> 01:00:46.377
I'm not some guy who will give up
his Tuesday night poker game here.

01:00:46.417 --> 01:00:48.941
This is my free will,
we're talking about.

01:00:50.449 --> 01:00:52.216
I've gotta be in control
of my own destiny.

01:00:53.252 --> 01:00:54.512
Your destiny.

01:00:55.287 --> 01:00:58.785
- You can't be serious!
- I couldn't be more serious.

01:00:58.824 --> 01:01:02.640
Then you know what? You're in for a rocky ride,
because a man's character is its destiny.

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:03.720
That's right.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:07.385
What? What did you just say?

01:01:07.425 --> 01:01:10.129
Was it some kind of a curse?

01:01:10.168 --> 01:01:11.866
Yeah, in your case it is.

01:01:35.227 --> 01:01:37.695
- Good morning.
- We need to talk.

01:01:37.729 --> 01:01:41.087
You're right. We need to talk about that
mess you left in the kitchen last night.

01:01:41.127 --> 01:01:42.588
No, it's Tom.

01:01:45.437 --> 01:01:47.462
He left last night.

01:01:47.506 --> 01:01:51.465
We were kissing and then
we started floating.

01:01:52.678 --> 01:01:54.578
Metaphorically floating?

01:01:54.613 --> 01:01:56.205
Literally floating.

01:01:57.049 --> 01:01:58.846
Literally floating?

01:01:58.884 --> 01:02:02.614
I think. Oh, god,
I don't even know anymore.

01:02:02.654 --> 01:02:04.778
You mean like floating off the ground,
floating...

01:02:04.818 --> 01:02:07.190
Nolan, that's not the point.

01:02:07.226 --> 01:02:10.193
Amanda, what's the problem?

01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:13.420
I'm just so confused.

01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.497
You've probably freaked him out.

01:02:16.702 --> 01:02:20.269
- So, what? Do I just give up on him?
- No!

01:02:20.706 --> 01:02:22.902
No, you just have to show him

01:02:22.942 --> 01:02:26.103
that being in love is even better
than falling in love.

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:32.080
I guess I could return his wallet.

01:02:32.117 --> 01:02:34.108
You stole his wallet?

01:02:34.152 --> 01:02:36.416
No! He dropped it.

01:02:36.455 --> 01:02:38.855
Yeah, yeah, right.
When he was floating.

01:02:38.891 --> 01:02:40.119
Very cute.

01:02:42.794 --> 01:02:44.125
You have to read this.

01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:46.991
I think you might make it.

01:02:49.635 --> 01:02:51.865
"TriBeCa gem rediscovered:

01:02:51.904 --> 01:02:54.134
magic in the kitchen."

01:02:59.878 --> 01:03:01.067
Who's there?

01:03:02.114 --> 01:03:03.114
It's me.

01:03:03.148 --> 01:03:05.840
God, it's hot in here,
I'm gonna open a window.

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:08.685
No, no, no.
She'll get in.

01:03:08.686 --> 01:03:09.686
Who?

01:03:09.821 --> 01:03:11.880
What the hell happened to you?

01:03:11.924 --> 01:03:14.654
It's Amanda. She's a witch.

01:03:14.693 --> 01:03:17.093
Just can't. I knew it!

01:03:18.263 --> 01:03:20.527
She forced me!
I never had a chance.

01:03:21.433 --> 01:03:26.370
And then I was pinned to her ceiling.

01:03:26.405 --> 01:03:28.600
And then she cursed me!

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.600
She said with this creepy little voice:
"A man's character is his destiny."

01:03:31.944 --> 01:03:34.811
She is a wise witch,
casts spells and proverbs.

01:03:34.846 --> 01:03:37.406
Lois, I know you think
I'm insane.

01:03:37.449 --> 01:03:39.542
"It's that old black magic!"

01:03:39.585 --> 01:03:42.986
"It's got you in its spin"

01:03:43.021 --> 01:03:44.181
You're in love.

01:03:44.222 --> 01:03:46.349
Oh, god!
If I'd just stuck to the Rule.

01:03:46.391 --> 01:03:50.085
Here is my rule: eat, drink,
take in everything and give back the same.

01:03:52.197 --> 01:03:53.596
How did you get in here?

01:03:54.433 --> 01:03:55.433
The door.

01:03:57.469 --> 01:04:00.961
I just came to return this to you.

01:04:01.006 --> 01:04:04.203
- You dropped it.
- That's fine.

01:04:04.776 --> 01:04:06.573
I take it, you're Amanda.

01:04:06.612 --> 01:04:07.943
It's very nice to meet you.

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:10.745
- I'm Lois and I'm leaving.
- No, no, no, no!

01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:13.575
You stay.

01:04:13.619 --> 01:04:14.881
It's okay.

01:04:15.855 --> 01:04:18.853
That's how you want it.
Oh, boy.

01:04:23.128 --> 01:04:28.498
I know that the last few days
have been odd.

01:04:30.102 --> 01:04:33.469
But my whole life was ordinary.

01:04:33.505 --> 01:04:37.997
And then we met and these amazing things
started to happen.

01:04:38.043 --> 01:04:39.043
And...

01:04:42.948 --> 01:04:48.215
And I can't explain them
and I know that bothers you.

01:04:48.253 --> 01:04:53.589
Tom, your life was full
of spectacular stuff

01:04:53.625 --> 01:04:55.115
but mine wasn't.

01:04:57.062 --> 01:04:59.189
For the first time

01:04:59.231 --> 01:05:01.631
I feel like I could do anything.

01:05:03.068 --> 01:05:08.335
And I don't know if I need you
to keep that feeling

01:05:10.976 --> 01:05:12.711
but I know I want you.

01:05:14.412 --> 01:05:15.912
Amanda, I...

01:05:18.049 --> 01:05:20.014
I think that...

01:05:24.155 --> 01:05:25.952
How do you feel?

01:05:29.894 --> 01:05:31.919
I'm not sure, Amanda.

01:05:35.767 --> 01:05:37.132
I'm not sure.

01:05:39.003 --> 01:05:40.468
This is no knife!

01:05:42.675 --> 01:05:46.537
- Hey, what the hell are you doing?
- I spit on your knife!

01:05:51.082 --> 01:05:52.743
Hey, what the hell...!

01:05:52.784 --> 01:05:55.309
I spit on your restaurant!

01:05:56.421 --> 01:05:58.948
- And finally I spit on...
- No, no, no!

01:05:58.988 --> 01:05:59.988
Allow me.

01:06:00.492 --> 01:06:01.784
There. Are we okay?

01:06:01.824 --> 01:06:04.390
That was the first intelligent
thing you've done.

01:06:04.429 --> 01:06:05.823
And I fire you!

01:06:05.863 --> 01:06:08.259
What the hell are you talking about?
You can't fire me.

01:06:08.299 --> 01:06:11.798
- Au revoir, dick head!
- Valderon, where are you going?

01:06:11.838 --> 01:06:14.298
You can't leave.
You're under contract.

01:06:14.339 --> 01:06:16.671
Fine, this is great!
Now do you believe me?

01:06:16.708 --> 01:06:18.767
Do you think that I have
something to do with this?

01:06:18.807 --> 01:06:20.740
Amanda, if the broom fits,
ride it!

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:22.778
Bartlett, you're an idiot!

01:06:22.818 --> 01:06:24.492
- I just saw Valderon!
- Everything is fine.

01:06:24.516 --> 01:06:26.807
What is the big plan
now that you have no chef?

01:06:26.847 --> 01:06:28.128
- I have a great plan.
- Excuse me.

01:06:28.152 --> 01:06:29.819
- I was just leaving.
- No, Amanda.

01:06:29.859 --> 01:06:34.153
- Jonathan, this is Amanda Shelton.
- How do you do?

01:06:34.192 --> 01:06:36.854
- She made the eclairs.
- We've got a plan.

01:06:38.329 --> 01:06:42.294
Oh, Bartlett, you're a genius!
You get rid of that french asshole

01:06:42.334 --> 01:06:44.278
and then you bring in
this heavenly creature to cook!

01:06:44.302 --> 01:06:47.215
- What? I am not cooking for him.
- No, Jonathan, she is not cooking for me.

01:06:47.239 --> 01:06:49.162
- Why? You only do desserts?
- No, but...

01:06:49.202 --> 01:06:52.267
Everything else is as good
as those incredible pastries?

01:06:52.307 --> 01:06:55.441
Tom was just telling me
what a magical chef Amanda is.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:58.142
No, magical, no.
Demonic is more like it.

01:06:58.183 --> 01:06:59.907
- She can't do this!
- I can do it.

01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:02.034
Amanda, you can't be serious.

01:07:02.074 --> 01:07:04.988
You're gonna replace a 4-star chef
with 24 years of experience?

01:07:05.028 --> 01:07:08.756
- No, I'm sorry. It can't be done!
- I'm magical! You said it yourself.

01:07:08.796 --> 01:07:10.354
Can you do this job tomorrow?

01:07:10.494 --> 01:07:11.855
- No!
- Yes!

01:07:12.496 --> 01:07:15.327
Lois, please,
show Amanda the kitchen

01:07:15.367 --> 01:07:17.599
while I have
a few words with Tom.

01:07:18.169 --> 01:07:20.836
- Great!
- And Lois, are you busy

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:23.800
after I'm done
chewing Tom's head off?

01:07:23.842 --> 01:07:25.867
You're the boss, Mr. Bendel.

01:07:26.979 --> 01:07:33.015
No, you...
you'll be the boss this time.

01:07:39.324 --> 01:07:41.224
My god, Bartlett!

01:07:41.926 --> 01:07:44.554
If you need something, call me.

01:07:44.596 --> 01:07:48.054
Although I don't know how to do
anything except buy clothes.

01:07:48.099 --> 01:07:50.124
I'm not this crazy,
I can't do this.

01:07:50.168 --> 01:07:52.859
I just read about you in the paper.
What are you afraid of?

01:07:53.203 --> 01:07:54.337
What?

01:07:54.377 --> 01:07:56.663
That I'm just having
a lucky couple of weeks.

01:07:56.708 --> 01:07:59.575
It's just the beginning of a
long lucky streak.

01:07:59.611 --> 01:08:01.101
Hopefully.

01:08:01.145 --> 01:08:02.578
Thanks.

01:08:02.614 --> 01:08:06.377
But you're gonna need both hands
and so do I.

01:08:06.417 --> 01:08:07.647
Do you think

01:08:07.687 --> 01:08:09.562
- you could give me back my hand?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:10.951
- Do you want it?
- Yeah.

01:08:11.352 --> 01:08:12.352
Oh, god.

01:08:13.925 --> 01:08:16.225
- What the hell has come into you?
- She did.

01:08:16.265 --> 01:08:17.616
She's some kind of a witch.

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:19.821
- You have no idea what...
- She's a great cook!

01:08:19.863 --> 01:08:21.107
And she's available
tomorrow night

01:08:21.131 --> 01:08:22.761
when everyone
is expecting to be fed

01:08:22.801 --> 01:08:24.433
the most incredible food
in the world.

01:08:24.469 --> 01:08:26.066
Let me try to get
Valderon back.

01:08:26.106 --> 01:08:27.770
No, no, no.
You talked me into this.

01:08:27.805 --> 01:08:31.036
Now you better find the nerve
to follow through.

01:08:31.075 --> 01:08:32.474
She can ruin us, Jonathan.

01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:34.444
She is cooking!

01:08:34.479 --> 01:08:36.912
Develop some courage, man!

01:08:38.049 --> 01:08:40.346
And shave while you're at it.

01:09:10.948 --> 01:09:12.416
What are you doing here?

01:09:13.984 --> 01:09:16.920
Stupid question.
You work here.

01:09:18.122 --> 01:09:21.182
You're probably wondering,
what I'm doing here.

01:09:21.225 --> 01:09:24.023
I just came to
get a feel for the kitchen.

01:09:24.062 --> 01:09:26.758
So I know my way around tomorrow.

01:09:26.798 --> 01:09:28.129
I understand.

01:09:29.466 --> 01:09:32.060
- You do?
- Sure.

01:09:33.171 --> 01:09:34.798
Do you have everything you need?

01:09:36.341 --> 01:09:39.640
I wouldn't mind
a little more confidence, but...

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:41.234
I'm gonna do the Peach...

01:09:43.214 --> 01:09:44.908
You don't want to know about this.

01:09:46.818 --> 01:09:50.219
You just want me to tell you
that everything is gonna be okay, right?

01:09:51.456 --> 01:09:52.979
Well, it will be.

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:56.760
Good.

01:10:00.365 --> 01:10:01.957
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

01:10:03.858 --> 01:10:04.858
Amanda...

01:10:06.359 --> 01:10:07.359
Yes?

01:10:09.607 --> 01:10:11.006
You're not...

01:10:14.712 --> 01:10:18.148
You're not gonna do anything funny tomorrow,
are you?

01:10:21.488 --> 01:10:25.380
No. Nothing funny.

01:10:27.992 --> 01:10:28.992
Good.

01:11:14.305 --> 01:11:16.205
- Ready?
- I forgot my earrings!

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.003
You look great.

01:11:18.042 --> 01:11:20.909
Nolan, all of this started happening
when I put on my mother's earrings.

01:11:20.945 --> 01:11:24.745
Can you give me a better reason
for why am I cooking suddenly so good?

01:11:24.782 --> 01:11:28.149
Yes, because that day
you wanted it to be good.

01:11:28.186 --> 01:11:32.418
You wanted it to be really good
and you wanted it bad enough.

01:11:32.457 --> 01:11:34.425
That's the magic, Amanda.

01:11:34.459 --> 01:11:37.394
Not your mom's old earrings.

01:11:37.428 --> 01:11:39.761
Okay?
So, let's go.

01:11:40.898 --> 01:11:42.889
Hey, listen.

01:11:44.302 --> 01:11:47.294
Even Dumbo flew
without his feather.

01:11:54.846 --> 01:11:55.846
Excuse me.

01:11:57.181 --> 01:11:58.409
Excuse me?

01:12:03.087 --> 01:12:08.450
Hi. I'm Amanda Shelton
and this is Nolan Traynor.

01:12:09.151 --> 01:12:10.651
I'm the new chef.

01:12:11.752 --> 01:12:14.252
And I just wanted to say "hi".

01:12:17.668 --> 01:12:20.605
Great start...

01:12:20.738 --> 01:12:24.071
That will come later.
You stay close.

01:12:24.108 --> 01:12:25.666
I'll need all the friends I can get.

01:12:29.513 --> 01:12:31.674
Excuse me, Mademoiselle.

01:12:31.716 --> 01:12:35.277
I am François Demer, sous-chef.

01:12:35.319 --> 01:12:37.981
If you like, I have a suggestion.

01:12:38.022 --> 01:12:39.250
That would be great.

01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:42.589
I have worked
for chef Valderon for 15 years.

01:12:42.627 --> 01:12:45.425
And I offer
to carry on in his behalf.

01:12:45.463 --> 01:12:50.093
Thank you, François, but
Mr. Bendel asked me to cook tonight.

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:54.036
In that case,
what would you like?

01:12:54.071 --> 01:12:55.766
Why don't you do
as you normally do.

01:12:55.806 --> 01:12:57.899
I am, mademoiselle.

01:12:57.942 --> 01:12:59.466
What are you doing?

01:12:59.510 --> 01:13:02.536
Waiting for instructions.

01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:06.038
Monsieur Valderon
always gives us instructions.

01:13:06.083 --> 01:13:08.074
Then why don't you start
with the hors d'oeuvres?

01:13:09.587 --> 01:13:11.350
Done, mademoiselle.

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:16.340
Tom...

01:13:16.527 --> 01:13:19.792
Come on, time to face
the firing squad.

01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:22.060
Okay.

01:13:22.099 --> 01:13:24.727
- That's last year's tuxedo.
- What?

01:13:26.037 --> 01:13:28.096
Oh, shit!

01:13:28.939 --> 01:13:30.463
Lois, I completely lost the plot.

01:13:30.508 --> 01:13:33.568
I'm off the deep end.
Something is wrong with me.

01:13:33.611 --> 01:13:35.841
Y'all tangled up
your underwear.

01:13:47.958 --> 01:13:51.359
You look like a tasty
cherry tartlet.

01:13:51.395 --> 01:13:52.919
Alright, here, throw this in.

01:13:52.963 --> 01:13:55.488
Are you crazy?
That's Dom Perignon!

01:13:55.533 --> 01:13:56.228
Exactly!

01:13:56.268 --> 01:13:57.864
It's the best.
You want the best, right?

01:13:57.904 --> 01:13:59.628
Do you know
how expensive that stuff is?

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:02.266
Amanda, we're uptown.
They expect expensive.

01:14:02.306 --> 01:14:04.104
Jonathan? Lois?

01:14:04.144 --> 01:14:06.743
Hannah Wahlberg
and Frank Rogers, of the Times.

01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:09.872
Beautiful!

01:14:10.014 --> 01:14:12.079
Gil, I'd like to introduce you
to Jonathan Bendel.

01:14:12.116 --> 01:14:13.378
Jonathan, this is Gil Shapiro.

01:14:13.417 --> 01:14:15.544
He is the genius
behind "American Gourmet".

01:14:15.586 --> 01:14:17.281
Jonathan, you have a hit
on your hands.

01:14:17.321 --> 01:14:19.812
Everyone is stunned that you got
Valderon.

01:14:21.492 --> 01:14:22.459
Wasn't easy.

01:14:22.493 --> 01:14:25.053
I'm looking forward to see
what he's cooking this evening.

01:14:29.365 --> 01:14:31.862
These are pretty much ready.

01:14:31.902 --> 01:14:33.995
François, I'm ready for the truffles.

01:14:34.038 --> 01:14:35.130
No truffles!

01:14:38.042 --> 01:14:39.839
What are you talking about,
"no truffles"?

01:14:39.877 --> 01:14:42.607
Oui, absolutely no truffles.

01:14:42.646 --> 01:14:44.876
Monsieur Valderon
picks them up himself.

01:14:44.915 --> 01:14:47.076
And so naturally
he took them.

01:14:47.985 --> 01:14:50.078
I can't make truffle slippers
without truffles.

01:14:50.121 --> 01:14:53.090
Yes. But could you
make some with truffles?

01:14:53.124 --> 01:14:54.592
Wait a minute.

01:14:54.826 --> 01:14:56.820
François,
is everything going well in here?

01:14:57.328 --> 01:15:01.264
Nous nageons
dans une flaque de merde.

01:15:01.298 --> 01:15:03.266
Good! Good!

01:15:04.468 --> 01:15:05.468
Carry on!

01:15:08.005 --> 01:15:09.632
What did the french guy say?

01:15:09.673 --> 01:15:11.106
Oh, everything is fine.

01:15:15.412 --> 01:15:17.141
You better watch your back.

01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:40.340
Amanda...

01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:44.331
- Can't do this.
- No!

01:15:46.210 --> 01:15:50.044
Amanda, now is not the time for that.
Alright?

01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:53.540
Okay, look. You're Patrick Ewing.
I'm John Starks.

01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:55.640
We are up by 1. There's
5 seconds left in the game.

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.356
Jordan gets the ball. He goes around
the pippin' screen taking me out.

01:15:58.380 --> 01:15:59.640
It's only you and him.

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.656
He goes off for the shot,
and you don't throw the foul

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.679
and they win the game.

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:06.252
Amanda, we are standing in the paint!

01:16:06.253 --> 01:16:08.124
You gotta make
your presence felt.

01:16:09.533 --> 01:16:10.966
Are you with me?

01:16:14.004 --> 01:16:15.004
Okay.

01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:24.140
François!

01:16:25.282 --> 01:16:27.373
You think I don't speak French?

01:16:27.413 --> 01:16:30.414
- Donne moi des figues!
- De quoi?

01:16:31.055 --> 01:16:32.352
That's right. Figs!

01:16:35.826 --> 01:16:38.188
Okay, I can do this.

01:16:38.527 --> 01:16:40.151
Just have to do
a little rearranging.

01:16:41.031 --> 01:16:42.328
The menu is gonna change.

01:16:42.366 --> 01:16:44.300
The menu is gonna change!

01:16:57.616 --> 01:17:00.743
Tom, have you tried this?
It's incredible!

01:17:00.784 --> 01:17:03.912
No, Lois. I'm too nervous tonight.

01:17:03.954 --> 01:17:05.148
Exceptional!

01:17:06.290 --> 01:17:08.857
Figs, inspired choice.

01:17:09.627 --> 01:17:11.424
I wonder who's reinventing himself.

01:17:11.462 --> 01:17:15.125
This night may be full
of unexpected pleasure.

01:17:16.667 --> 01:17:18.794
This looks just yummy.

01:17:35.819 --> 01:17:37.411
Sensational!

01:17:37.554 --> 01:17:41.957
The foie gras melted in your mouth.

01:17:41.992 --> 01:17:44.152
I wish I could cook like this.

01:17:45.596 --> 01:17:48.394
I always wanted to be a chef.

01:17:48.432 --> 01:17:51.799
I never knew that.

01:17:51.835 --> 01:17:56.329
This food is the perfect poem
I never wrote.

01:17:56.373 --> 01:17:59.501
It is the happiness,
that only comes in dreams.

01:17:59.543 --> 01:18:03.479
It is a symphony of joy,
it is a silver note.

01:18:03.514 --> 01:18:06.005
It seems it's love,
pure love.

01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:09.281
To love.

01:18:10.287 --> 01:18:13.916
- I'm sorry.
- But why, Hannah?

01:18:13.958 --> 01:18:18.686
The love that turns into magic
once in a blue moon.

01:18:41.952 --> 01:18:43.447
What do you mean everything is okay?

01:18:43.587 --> 01:18:46.515
Everyone is crying!
And that's only the appetizer.

01:18:46.557 --> 01:18:48.218
It's fantastic.

01:18:48.258 --> 01:18:51.386
Look around,
everybody enjoys a good cry.

01:18:51.428 --> 01:18:52.428
It's refreshing.

01:18:56.166 --> 01:18:59.897
I do not want you to panic or anything
but something is happening out there.

01:19:02.473 --> 01:19:03.565
Amanda, I'm sorry.

01:19:07.544 --> 01:19:09.808
Why did I ever doubt?

01:19:10.981 --> 01:19:12.539
I admire you.

01:19:14.051 --> 01:19:16.042
Like my grandfather.

01:19:17.054 --> 01:19:20.046
Only I don't hate you.

01:19:22.747 --> 01:19:23.747
I really don't know.

01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:27.054
It's okay.

01:19:33.737 --> 01:19:35.265
Oh, god! Oh, god!

01:19:37.808 --> 01:19:39.742
Don't have a panic attack!

01:19:39.777 --> 01:19:41.335
And don't curse, Amanda!

01:19:41.378 --> 01:19:43.608
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

01:19:45.449 --> 01:19:46.916
I'm sorry.

01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:49.714
- Hold the duck!
- No, Amanda! Come back over here!

01:19:49.753 --> 01:19:51.084
Oh, god!

01:19:52.656 --> 01:19:55.583
How stupid am I!
I ruined everything!

01:19:55.793 --> 01:19:57.500
I came up here to show him
how much I love him

01:19:57.524 --> 01:19:58.685
and this is what I do!

01:19:58.725 --> 01:20:00.260
No, he knows...

01:20:00.297 --> 01:20:03.357
- Nolan, you too?
- It's all my fault!

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:06.633
What are you talking about?
This has 'me' written all over it.

01:20:06.673 --> 01:20:09.273
We've got to move to New Guinea,
some place where nobody knows us.

01:20:09.306 --> 01:20:11.771
- What did you do? Eat the food?
- No, I didn't eat the food.

01:20:11.811 --> 01:20:14.165
I did eat the food
and it's fantastic!

01:20:14.211 --> 01:20:15.940
Amanda, don't you understand?

01:20:15.979 --> 01:20:18.783
Everything you're feeling,
is going into your food.

01:20:18.916 --> 01:20:22.113
Look, nobody is leaving,
it's irresistible!

01:20:22.153 --> 01:20:24.144
Yes. Just breathe. Breathe.

01:20:24.188 --> 01:20:27.351
I admit that it is a bit
of an unconventional event.

01:20:27.391 --> 01:20:29.985
But completely unforgettable.

01:20:30.027 --> 01:20:32.359
You have to go on.

01:20:32.396 --> 01:20:33.556
You have to feed them.

01:20:33.597 --> 01:20:35.656
Feed them?
I'll probably kill them!

01:20:35.699 --> 01:20:38.933
Well, mademoiselle. Bravo.

01:20:39.804 --> 01:20:44.764
I assume you will be leaving
now that you have stunned them into silence.

01:20:44.809 --> 01:20:45.935
Stunned?

01:21:10.434 --> 01:21:12.367
This is serious.
We must go.

01:21:13.103 --> 01:21:15.230
Look at them.
They all look like they're dead.

01:21:15.272 --> 01:21:18.036
No, no, I don't think
they're dead at all.

01:21:20.177 --> 01:21:22.111
They're just in a trance.

01:21:23.113 --> 01:21:24.341
This is amazing.

01:21:24.381 --> 01:21:25.780
Did you say "trance"?

01:21:25.816 --> 01:21:27.478
So we can do with them
whatever we want?

01:21:27.518 --> 01:21:29.051
No, no, no,
but she could.

01:21:29.086 --> 01:21:32.819
Amanda, you must make all the women love me
and all men give me their wallets.

01:21:32.857 --> 01:21:34.882
- I can't do that!
- No!

01:21:35.893 --> 01:21:38.157
But I may be able to do something better.

01:21:38.195 --> 01:21:39.526
Come on.

01:21:39.563 --> 01:21:41.463
Fantastic.

01:21:52.210 --> 01:21:55.874
- Lois, why is everyone so quiet?
- Shhhhh...

01:21:57.147 --> 01:21:59.012
This is nutty.

01:22:01.619 --> 01:22:03.177
He is so nutty...

01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:04.220
I know.

01:22:06.824 --> 01:22:08.587
Maybe he's too busy
with food to come.

01:22:09.627 --> 01:22:12.892
Maybe you should think about the dessert?

01:22:13.631 --> 01:22:15.292
I can't watch this.

01:22:15.332 --> 01:22:17.596
I don't know what to do anymore.

01:22:17.635 --> 01:22:19.660
Who am I kidding, Nolan?

01:22:19.703 --> 01:22:22.900
He is not coming in here
and I don't blame him.

01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:24.874
You know, I'm just gonna go.

01:22:24.909 --> 01:22:26.604
Can anyone take this?

01:22:56.006 --> 01:22:58.634
Would you grace me with a dance?

01:25:57.890 --> 01:25:59.090
Amanda!

01:26:00.591 --> 01:26:02.754
Hudson and J., please.

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:04.840
Amanda!

01:27:47.564 --> 01:27:48.564
Success!

01:27:52.836 --> 01:27:54.326
Here my sweet,

01:27:55.339 --> 01:27:57.830
taste a little bit of heaven.

01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:05.640
I had to stop for shoes.

01:29:07.911 --> 01:29:10.004
You are so beautiful.

01:29:28.732 --> 01:29:30.632
I'm sorry I was so stupid.

01:29:32.135 --> 01:29:33.966
I just didn't know what to do.

01:29:35.238 --> 01:29:36.535
But I know I want you.

01:29:39.042 --> 01:29:41.408
I just need a second chance.

01:29:42.746 --> 01:29:46.204
You're so dense
that you may need a fourth or fifth...

01:29:46.249 --> 01:29:48.342
I'll take whatever I can.

01:29:51.488 --> 01:29:53.149
I love you.

01:29:54.624 --> 01:29:56.990
I hope that's not just the fog talking.

01:29:59.696 --> 01:30:01.095
No, it's not.

01:30:02.432 --> 01:30:03.490
Good.

01:30:04.701 --> 01:30:07.192
Because I love you.

01:30:07.237 --> 01:30:10.138
I think I've loved you
since the first day in the market.

01:30:10.173 --> 01:30:14.303
You mean when I had
my hand up your pants?

01:30:14.344 --> 01:30:16.778
- Men are so easy.
- Oh, yeah.
