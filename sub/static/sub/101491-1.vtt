01:19.592 --> 01:20.718
You're gonna
have to say that again.

01:20.802 --> 01:21.886
I can't hear you.

01:24.472 --> 01:25.473
Yeah, wh...

01:26.224 --> 01:27.225
Why didn't you say so?

01:30.144 --> 01:31.145
You're not a spy.

01:32.355 --> 01:33.356
Never said I was.

01:33.648 --> 01:34.816
You said you spy on people.

01:36.526 --> 01:37.694
You got another one of those?

01:42.949 --> 01:43.950
Sweet.

01:45.201 --> 01:46.452
So, what, like...

01:47.495 --> 01:49.414
You wear disguises and stuff?

01:50.164 --> 01:51.165
What?

01:51.374 --> 01:52.375
You carry a gun?

01:52.709 --> 01:53.835
No, I don't ever carry a...

01:54.210 --> 01:55.753
I don't wanna shoot anybody.

01:56.045 --> 01:57.589
So then, what's it like?

01:58.339 --> 01:59.507
It's gotta be exciting.

01:59.799 --> 02:00.884
It can be, I guess.

02:04.095 --> 02:06.306
I dunno. I've only been
at it for a couple months, so...

02:06.681 --> 02:08.558
I'm like, still,
basically in training.

02:11.686 --> 02:12.979
I think it's hot.

02:13.563 --> 02:14.564
Oh yeah?

02:15.607 --> 02:17.692
Spying on people.
It's like...

02:19.068 --> 02:20.778
It's kinda like voyeurism.

02:25.116 --> 02:26.409
I think I'd be a good spy.

02:27.160 --> 02:28.161
I'm pretty sneaky.

02:29.662 --> 02:30.997
- Are you?
- Yeah.

02:32.373 --> 02:33.374
You should take me out with you.

02:33.458 --> 02:34.459
I could be like, your...

02:35.752 --> 02:37.670
Like your sidekick. Yeah.

02:38.546 --> 02:41.758
Follow people places
that you can't go.

03:36.354 --> 03:37.355
The fuck?

04:03.882 --> 04:04.883
Oh shit.

04:12.098 --> 04:14.100
Claimant can't lift
more than ten pounds.

04:15.393 --> 04:17.812
Claimant can't lift her
arms over her head.

04:19.480 --> 04:22.192
Claimant has
depression and anxiety

04:22.483 --> 04:24.194
as a result of the accident.

04:55.099 --> 04:56.643
Hey Pat. You wanted to see me?

04:56.851 --> 04:58.269
Yeah.

04:58.520 --> 04:59.521
Have a seat.

05:05.443 --> 05:06.444
Well?

05:07.654 --> 05:08.738
How's it going?

05:09.030 --> 05:10.949
Things are getting easier,
I think.

05:12.909 --> 05:14.118
Joe working with you at all?

05:15.161 --> 05:16.496
He's old-school, I know,

05:16.579 --> 05:18.456
but he's forgotten
more about surveillance

05:18.540 --> 05:20.083
than you or I will ever know.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.545
Joe's been here so long,
he trained me,

05:23.795 --> 05:25.380
almost 20 years ago now.

05:25.713 --> 05:26.923
- Wow, really?
- Yeah.

05:27.423 --> 05:28.883
Back then, was he a little, uh...

05:28.967 --> 05:30.426
- Bat-shit crazy?
- Yeah.

05:30.510 --> 05:31.511
Ah, yeah.

05:31.636 --> 05:34.097
A little worse, maybe, with age.

05:36.057 --> 05:38.434
Joe's got high blood pressure,
did he ever tell you that?

05:39.602 --> 05:40.812
I'm always on him...

05:40.895 --> 05:43.690
gotta quit smoking,
gotta quit eating like shit,

05:43.773 --> 05:44.983
but he doesn't listen.

05:47.735 --> 05:48.736
Anyway,

05:50.864 --> 05:52.574
what's happening
with the Morgan case?

05:53.366 --> 05:54.367
Um...

05:55.326 --> 05:56.327
Honestly?

05:58.538 --> 05:59.956
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

06:01.291 --> 06:02.458
We got eight days on her.

06:02.542 --> 06:03.543
I know.

06:03.626 --> 06:05.587
You having
any trouble locating her?

06:06.004 --> 06:09.007
No, it's not that. I mean, um...

06:11.217 --> 06:12.302
I don't think so.

06:12.468 --> 06:13.970
I mean the address is accurate.

06:15.263 --> 06:16.681
And the vehicle is...

06:16.973 --> 06:18.141
Good. That's good.

06:19.184 --> 06:20.226
It'll pop.

06:20.602 --> 06:21.644
Yeah.

06:21.811 --> 06:22.854
For sure.

06:23.062 --> 06:24.063
It's a huge case.

06:24.147 --> 06:25.148
I know. I know.

06:25.690 --> 06:27.358
For us.
It's a huge case for us.

06:27.442 --> 06:29.277
- Right.
- It's Aegis Insurance.

06:30.236 --> 06:32.864
They were one of our biggest
clients a couple of years ago.

06:33.406 --> 06:36.451
Then we fucked up real bad
on one of their cases, and...

06:36.576 --> 06:37.577
And they dropped us.

06:38.369 --> 06:39.370
Really?

06:41.664 --> 06:42.665
What happened?

06:43.041 --> 06:44.250
A fucking nightmare.

06:44.876 --> 06:48.963
Our investigators stuck a GPS
tracker on a claimant's car,

06:49.047 --> 06:50.048
dumb fuck.

06:50.381 --> 06:52.967
We don't do that kind of thing.

06:53.760 --> 06:54.761
It's illegal.

06:56.471 --> 06:58.806
And anyway, the claimant
took her car to a mechanic,

06:58.890 --> 06:59.891
mechanic found it.

07:00.892 --> 07:02.977
The thing was
registered to our guy.

07:03.520 --> 07:04.938
Goddamn clusterfuck.

07:05.647 --> 07:08.107
So we gotta get
something on Morgan.

07:08.983 --> 07:09.984
Yeah, I will.

07:10.443 --> 07:11.611
Be careful too.

07:11.903 --> 07:13.279
Don't get burned.

07:13.404 --> 07:14.405
Right.

07:14.781 --> 07:16.324
- I'll try not to.
- Good.

07:16.783 --> 07:17.909
- Yep.
- Alright.

07:32.298 --> 07:33.299
Hey.

08:16.968 --> 08:19.012
I don't really
understand your question.

08:22.307 --> 08:23.308
Me neither.

08:25.727 --> 08:26.728
Hm.

08:30.607 --> 08:32.066
You brought a chick home, right?

08:33.400 --> 08:34.693
I was wasted.

08:35.570 --> 08:36.571
How was she?

08:37.030 --> 08:38.030
Blonde?

08:38.740 --> 08:39.741
Was she?

08:43.703 --> 08:44.704
You like,

08:46.164 --> 08:47.749
get her number?

08:50.084 --> 08:51.085
Guess not.

08:54.339 --> 08:55.673
- Oh well.
- Oh well.

08:56.674 --> 08:57.675
Yeah.

09:03.640 --> 09:04.641
Yo.

09:04.891 --> 09:05.892
How's your mom?

09:07.268 --> 09:08.269
Yeah.

09:08.645 --> 09:10.563
So you like,
have to have insurance now.

09:11.898 --> 09:12.941
I thought it was like,

09:14.025 --> 09:15.276
illegal not to.

09:15.860 --> 09:16.861
Wait, it is?

09:18.571 --> 09:19.697
That's what I thought.

09:23.201 --> 09:25.745
Well, I don't think they
can come to arrest her, I guess.

09:35.338 --> 09:36.714
It's just fucked up, you know.

09:38.174 --> 09:39.175
Like...

09:40.927 --> 09:43.012
It's not like you have
all this money, to just like,

09:43.638 --> 09:44.639
take care of it.

09:46.683 --> 09:47.725
Yeah, tell me about it.

09:53.982 --> 09:55.233
I have a plan though.

09:56.276 --> 09:58.278
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

09:59.404 --> 10:00.405
Bank robbery?

10:02.031 --> 10:03.032
Something like that.

10:27.891 --> 10:28.892
What do you think?

10:29.851 --> 10:30.852
About what?

10:31.060 --> 10:32.061
Same guy?

10:33.646 --> 10:35.857
I dunno, they all look
the fucking same to me.

10:38.902 --> 10:39.903
- Wow.
- Yeah.

10:40.528 --> 10:42.614
How'd that surveillance go?

10:43.531 --> 10:45.533
I mean, not bad.

10:47.202 --> 10:48.995
I'm trying to get a good
angle here of the building,

10:49.078 --> 10:51.122
you know, the front door.
There's a huge fucking

10:51.664 --> 10:52.874
bush that's blocking it.

10:52.999 --> 10:55.001
This guy lives next to
an elementary school.

10:55.210 --> 10:57.503
You know, I felt like a creep
sitting there, all day.

10:58.713 --> 11:01.049
At one point, this teacher
walks down to the fence

11:01.174 --> 11:02.884
and started looking
at me and my car.

11:04.093 --> 11:05.762
Jesus Christ, Ray.

11:07.096 --> 11:09.307
What is the most important thing
you have to remember

11:09.390 --> 11:10.642
when you're in the field?

11:10.808 --> 11:12.393
Always park in the shade?

11:12.602 --> 11:13.603
No.

11:14.479 --> 11:16.272
The most important thing
you have to remember

11:16.356 --> 11:17.398
when you're in the field,

11:17.732 --> 11:20.485
is that if you think
you're burnt on a case,

11:20.777 --> 11:22.862
You're not. Don't be paranoid.

11:23.238 --> 11:24.739
Or you'll never
make it on this job.

11:26.115 --> 11:28.952
29 years of surveillance.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.165
I think I've been burnt,
maybe five times.

11:34.707 --> 11:37.210
People in this city are stupid.

11:37.710 --> 11:38.711
They're blind.

11:39.254 --> 11:42.131
They're too wrapped up in
their own shit to notice you.

11:42.507 --> 11:44.300
Yeah, tell me about it.

11:44.467 --> 11:45.593
You think,

11:45.885 --> 11:48.471
a neighbor's suspicious
because they see your car?

11:49.055 --> 11:50.056
They're not.

11:50.765 --> 11:54.143
You think a claimant
is looking right at you?

11:54.269 --> 11:55.270
They're not.

11:57.313 --> 12:00.316
Unless police come tapping on
your window, you're not burned.

12:00.608 --> 12:02.360
And, maybe not even then.

12:03.736 --> 12:06.281
Unless the claimant
pulls over,

12:06.447 --> 12:07.615
walks up to you, and says,

12:07.699 --> 12:09.576
"Why the fuck
are you following me?"

12:10.243 --> 12:12.412
You're not fucking burned.

12:12.620 --> 12:13.663
You got it?

12:13.913 --> 12:15.331
Yeah, oh yeah. I got it.

12:15.999 --> 12:17.000
Yeah.

12:17.876 --> 12:18.877
Now...

12:19.919 --> 12:21.212
All that being said,

12:23.548 --> 12:25.550
you don't ever wanna get burned.

12:27.969 --> 12:29.304
Hey Joe, you, uh...

12:30.054 --> 12:31.931
You got any tips on,
uh, you know,

12:32.473 --> 12:34.309
not getting burned when
you're out on the field?

12:35.185 --> 12:36.186
No.

12:37.187 --> 12:38.188
Oh, okay.

12:39.105 --> 12:41.441
How's that
big case of yours going?

12:41.733 --> 12:43.651
Oh, which one?

12:44.152 --> 12:46.529
You know, the
high-exposure disability one.

12:47.363 --> 12:48.573
- Morgan?
- Morgan.

12:48.656 --> 12:49.657
Yeah, alright. Um...

12:50.825 --> 12:53.536
You know, I honestly
don't have anything on her yet.

12:54.329 --> 12:55.330
Hm.

13:06.466 --> 13:07.467
Ray? Hey.

13:07.675 --> 13:08.676
H

13:08.760 --> 13:09.761
Nice to meetcha.

13:09.928 --> 13:10.929
It's really loud out here.

13:11.012 --> 13:12.597
Yeah, you look much younger
than you sounded on the phone.

13:14.641 --> 13:16.226
- You get that, huh?
- Yeah, a lot.

13:16.476 --> 13:17.477
I do too.

13:18.353 --> 13:19.354
Alright, this way.

13:20.772 --> 13:21.773
So you can see...

13:21.856 --> 13:23.441
- Take a look at our inventory.
- Wow.

13:23.525 --> 13:24.526
It's not bad, huh?

13:25.401 --> 13:26.528
Whatever you need, we got.

13:26.611 --> 13:28.071
You got
a bunch of shit here, huh?

13:28.154 --> 13:30.406
Yeah,
handcuffs, whatever.

13:33.451 --> 13:34.494
Football...

13:35.036 --> 13:36.538
- Not really into sports.
- No?

13:36.621 --> 13:37.914
- Nope.
- What do you like?

13:38.748 --> 13:39.749
Halloween?

13:39.832 --> 13:41.167
Just sitting in my car, mostly.

13:41.751 --> 13:43.628
Oh, wow, okay. Well...

13:43.795 --> 13:44.796
Being a PI.

13:45.213 --> 13:47.257
Oh yeah...

13:47.340 --> 13:48.633
So you order through Amazon?

13:49.008 --> 13:50.051
Yeah.

13:50.385 --> 13:53.555
- Just camera equipment.
- Online. I see.

13:53.638 --> 13:54.931
We also got cameras.

13:57.559 --> 13:58.685
Mr. Brey.

13:59.853 --> 14:01.104
Pleasure to meet you.

14:01.646 --> 14:02.814
I mean.

14:02.897 --> 14:04.023
That's as good as I got.

14:04.107 --> 14:05.483
But there's a decent
shot of his face here.

14:05.567 --> 14:06.609
Yes, it is him.

14:07.026 --> 14:08.027
You're sure?

14:08.111 --> 14:09.153
I would recognise that lying

14:09.237 --> 14:10.613
motherfucker
anywhere.

14:10.697 --> 14:11.906
Excuse my language.

14:12.532 --> 14:13.741
No, I...

14:13.908 --> 14:15.702
It's okay. I understand.

14:16.160 --> 14:17.328
In my opinion,

14:17.704 --> 14:20.498
Manual Macias
is a lying motherfucker.

14:20.665 --> 14:21.666
Yeah.

14:21.749 --> 14:23.459
Yeah.
He came to work here,

14:23.918 --> 14:26.462
for 10 years in warehouse,
never take a day off.

14:26.796 --> 14:28.464
Even when his wife have baby,

14:28.756 --> 14:30.216
he come in everyday.

14:30.466 --> 14:32.552
He say he cannot miss work,
he need money.

14:32.844 --> 14:34.012
Need money for rent.

14:34.220 --> 14:36.556
Need money to buy food
for three children.

14:36.639 --> 14:38.433
Need money
for mother's medical bills.

14:38.516 --> 14:40.810
Need money,
need money, need money.

14:41.436 --> 14:43.021
He was a very hard worker.

14:43.396 --> 14:45.190
I feel for his difficulties.

14:46.691 --> 14:48.401
I know his life, it was...

14:49.194 --> 14:51.654
It was not easy,
but this, this...

14:52.947 --> 14:55.575
This bullshit
worker comp claim...

14:56.993 --> 15:00.330
He never filed an injury report
while he was working here?

15:00.413 --> 15:01.414
No!

15:01.539 --> 15:02.874
What happens is this:

15:03.082 --> 15:04.083
Mhm.

15:04.459 --> 15:05.460
Come winter time,

15:06.336 --> 15:08.129
when things are slow,
we have to lay people off.

15:08.296 --> 15:10.465
Sometimes we lay people off
who have worked here

15:10.548 --> 15:11.549
longer than Manual.

15:11.633 --> 15:13.301
But then, we hire them back.

15:13.426 --> 15:15.386
Sometimes in summertime,
when work is good.

15:15.678 --> 15:16.679
But Manuel,

15:16.930 --> 15:18.890
he cannot sustain himself,
I think.

15:20.016 --> 15:21.809
He begs me not to fire him.

15:24.103 --> 15:25.897
But there is nothing I can do.

15:27.065 --> 15:30.276
So, a week after we let him go,

15:30.485 --> 15:33.112
we get a letter from attorney

15:33.196 --> 15:35.990
saying he has all these
personal injuries, and I think,

15:36.199 --> 15:37.742
what the hell, you know?

15:38.952 --> 15:40.703
No one see him get hurt.

15:40.828 --> 15:43.831
He never tell
nobody he get hurt.

15:44.207 --> 15:47.252
And now suddenly he claim
he cannot work without a cane.

15:48.586 --> 15:49.921
Yes, look.

15:52.048 --> 15:53.049
He says,

15:53.508 --> 15:56.886
"Cumulative trauma since 2007."

15:57.011 --> 15:59.681
He work here every single day,
never miss one.

16:00.473 --> 16:01.516
Gee, the's crazy.

16:01.724 --> 16:04.310
I know it is crazy,
and you know what is more crazy?

16:04.519 --> 16:07.063
After, I tell him
about attorney letter.

16:07.480 --> 16:08.898
Manuel call me on cellphone.

16:09.315 --> 16:11.943
And he beg me
to give him his job back.

16:12.277 --> 16:13.278
He say,

16:13.361 --> 16:14.362
"Mr. Kozlov,"

16:14.654 --> 16:16.406
"I will be
evicted from apartment."

16:16.656 --> 16:18.616
He say that is why
he has filed the claim.

16:18.700 --> 16:20.034
Not because he is injured.

16:21.661 --> 16:22.829
Listen, Mr. Brey.

16:24.122 --> 16:26.541
I own this
warehouse for 36 years.

16:26.624 --> 16:27.709
People get injured.

16:28.209 --> 16:30.044
It is a warehouse.
These things happen.

16:30.253 --> 16:33.882
But this astronomical
worker compensation premiums,

16:34.090 --> 16:37.886
they are my second
biggest expense after payroll.

16:39.429 --> 16:40.430
Yeah!

16:40.513 --> 16:43.933
I pay employee's
medical bills, but this...

16:44.934 --> 16:46.644
This Manuel Macias...

16:47.520 --> 16:49.647
This lying motherfucker!

16:50.648 --> 16:51.816
He never get hurt.

16:52.525 --> 16:53.610
He just want money.

16:55.320 --> 16:56.321
I hear ya, sir.

16:56.613 --> 16:58.656
I feel for him, truly.

16:59.032 --> 17:01.492
I do. But these phony claims,

17:01.743 --> 17:04.287
they push my rates up too much.

17:04.537 --> 17:06.664
And if I pay
every lying motherfucker,

17:06.789 --> 17:08.082
then I have to close the door,

17:08.165 --> 17:09.709
and if I close the doors,
what happen?

17:09.917 --> 17:11.961
259 men lose their jobs.

17:12.086 --> 17:14.297
259 Manuel Macias.

17:15.173 --> 17:16.883
Then you pretty fucking
busy, huh?

17:18.800 --> 17:19.801
True that.

17:40.865 --> 17:42.742
I got that video
from Thursday ID'ed.

17:43.117 --> 17:44.494
It is Macias.

17:45.662 --> 17:46.663
Macias.

17:46.788 --> 17:48.289
Macias.

17:48.373 --> 17:51.000
I met the insured.
Nice Russian Guy.

17:52.210 --> 17:54.546
He owns a warehouse
down in Downey.

17:57.215 --> 17:59.717
I hope I get something
good for him, you know.

17:59.968 --> 18:00.969
Why?

18:02.637 --> 18:05.265
Oh, cuz Macias is full of shit,
that's why.

18:05.473 --> 18:07.517
Well, so? What do you care?

18:07.600 --> 18:09.853
You save some
rich guy a few bucks?

18:10.103 --> 18:12.188
Ruin some poor wetback's life?

18:14.732 --> 18:16.192
Okay, um...

18:16.985 --> 18:19.153
But you know, if he's
seriously injured, then I...

18:19.237 --> 18:21.281
Well yeah, but then what?

18:21.406 --> 18:23.032
He gets paid,

18:23.324 --> 18:25.660
he calls his co-workers,

18:26.661 --> 18:29.622
Pablo, Rogelio, and Oscar,

18:30.373 --> 18:32.250
he refers them
to his scheisser lawyer

18:32.333 --> 18:35.211
and some fucking
chiropractor on Wilshire

18:35.295 --> 18:38.131
who'll diagnose all of them
with, um,

18:39.173 --> 18:40.717
soft-tissue injuries?

18:40.842 --> 18:43.678
Your friend, the insured,
closes doors. Nobody wins.

18:44.012 --> 18:45.305
No matter what you do,

18:45.388 --> 18:47.348
you get film,
you don't get film.

18:47.432 --> 18:48.433
Nobody wins.

18:51.978 --> 18:54.189
That can be
a new slogan for this company.

18:56.816 --> 18:58.109
I should email Chuck.

19:02.322 --> 19:04.616
It's cool. What's all this?
What're you working on?

19:05.992 --> 19:08.661
- Saleh Saleh.
- The hell is that?

19:10.038 --> 19:11.456
That, my boy,

19:11.789 --> 19:13.583
is the elusive white whale.

19:15.001 --> 19:18.129
I had a Saleh Saleh
case open in 2004.

19:18.213 --> 19:20.673
He was a driver
for one of the studios.

19:20.757 --> 19:24.093
Got blindsided
by a semi on the 405.

19:24.677 --> 19:26.679
Filed for complete disability.

19:26.763 --> 19:28.306
Seven figure settlement.

19:29.557 --> 19:32.685
Bilateral, lumbar, CT,

19:32.977 --> 19:36.147
anxiety, sexual dysfunction...
the whole nine yards.

19:36.856 --> 19:39.025
Insurance company got suspicious

19:39.150 --> 19:40.527
when an ex-coworker said

19:40.610 --> 19:45.323
that he spotted Saleh
at a gym in Van Nuys.

19:46.533 --> 19:47.534
Yeah.

19:50.828 --> 19:53.748
Yeah, this is the only
video I ever got back on him.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.668
He's outside a deposition,
back in '05.

19:58.169 --> 19:59.420
Since then,

20:00.380 --> 20:06.135
the carrier has spent probably,
50,000 dollars on surveillance.

20:07.262 --> 20:09.430
And not a damn thing
has shown up.

20:09.848 --> 20:12.016
- Ten?
- Ten years.

20:12.183 --> 20:14.018
No social media.

20:14.227 --> 20:15.895
No, um...

20:16.104 --> 20:19.941
No credit cards, no social
security number, no car.

20:21.067 --> 20:24.028
He's got a PO box, but nobody's
ever seen him there.

20:24.153 --> 20:28.074
But I've actually seen him
twice when I wasn't working.

20:29.659 --> 20:32.328
Once, in 2010,

20:32.412 --> 20:35.915
driving an unmarked
Mercedes up in Sylmar.

20:36.541 --> 20:39.544
And the second time on TV.

20:40.044 --> 20:41.296
- On TV?
- Yeah!

20:41.796 --> 20:44.215
Sitting three rows back
at a Laker's game.

20:45.258 --> 20:46.593
So you think he's still in LA?

20:47.552 --> 20:48.803
Oh, I know he is.

20:50.013 --> 20:51.681
Is that why he's up
on the monitor now?

20:51.764 --> 20:53.683
- Did the case get reopened?
- Yeah.

20:54.434 --> 20:56.436
For what has to be
the thousandth time.

20:57.770 --> 21:00.481
He's got a medical
appointment on Wednesday.

21:00.607 --> 21:01.900
They want a two man team.

21:01.983 --> 21:04.652
One guy in the lobby,
one guy outside in the car.

21:07.947 --> 21:09.157
Would you be available?

21:11.117 --> 21:12.118
Sure.

21:13.203 --> 21:14.454
Have you ever
done a medical before?

21:15.079 --> 21:17.248
No, uh, not that I, uh...

21:17.332 --> 21:18.541
You ever done a two man?

21:18.750 --> 21:19.751
No.

21:20.210 --> 21:21.211
You'll be fine.

21:21.628 --> 21:23.630
He won't show up, anyway.

21:24.839 --> 21:26.049
Sweet.

21:28.092 --> 21:30.428
All that maddens and torments.

21:31.596 --> 21:34.516
All that stirs up
the lees of things.

22:42.292 --> 22:43.751
So, I spoke to Earl.

22:44.127 --> 22:46.421
We talked to a couple
of our ex-coworkers,

22:46.546 --> 22:49.841
they're uncertain but they said
she used to do a yoga class

22:50.216 --> 22:52.468
in Silverlake
on Wednesday nights.

22:52.760 --> 22:55.138
Now, they didn't know
the time or place or anything,

22:55.305 --> 22:57.265
so I'm gonna have you
back out there tomorrow,

22:57.348 --> 22:58.433
starting round noon.

22:58.808 --> 23:01.603
And you can stick
around into the evening,

23:01.728 --> 23:03.062
and see if she
goes to this class.

23:03.980 --> 23:04.981
Alright.

23:05.064 --> 23:06.566
Have you used
the hidden camera yet?

23:07.942 --> 23:09.694
No, not yet.

23:09.903 --> 23:12.113
Alright. I'll have Joe
show how they work.

23:12.322 --> 23:15.742
Hidden cameras are the longest
running joke in this industry.

23:16.618 --> 23:19.412
It all started with
this fucking monstrosity.

23:20.121 --> 23:21.122
Jesus.

23:23.499 --> 23:25.501
Half the time,
it took video upside-down

23:25.585 --> 23:26.711
when it worked at all.

23:26.961 --> 23:28.838
Didn't have
a date-time stamp on it

23:28.922 --> 23:31.007
so it wasn't even
admissible in court, anyway.

23:31.966 --> 23:35.553
And then
it evolved into all of these.

23:35.929 --> 23:38.806
Hat camera, tie camera,

23:40.141 --> 23:43.144
pen camera, water-bottle camera.

23:44.062 --> 23:45.605
They all came from China,

23:45.939 --> 23:47.565
nobody could
understand the instructions,

23:47.649 --> 23:48.650
and they didn't work.

23:49.859 --> 23:51.778
- What the fuck is this?
- The um...

23:52.612 --> 23:53.905
Rock camera.

23:56.616 --> 23:58.451
Who the fuck
uses a rock camera, man?

23:59.202 --> 24:00.328
I have no idea.

24:03.456 --> 24:06.042
Well,
things are better nowadays.

24:07.085 --> 24:08.086
Voila.

24:09.837 --> 24:12.382
You just take this,
point it, and record.

24:12.465 --> 24:14.551
You push
the top button to turn it on.

24:14.634 --> 24:16.135
Push it again to record,

24:16.261 --> 24:18.763
and you push
the bottom to turn it off.

24:18.930 --> 24:20.223
This is so sick.

25:15.945 --> 25:16.946
Fuck.

25:30.752 --> 25:31.753
Hi!

25:32.503 --> 25:33.504
First time?

25:33.922 --> 25:34.923
Yeah.

25:35.048 --> 25:38.259
First time here,
or first time ever doing yoga?

25:39.344 --> 25:40.512
Yeah.

25:40.845 --> 25:41.846
Alright, well,

25:42.180 --> 25:44.182
just don't push
yourself too hard, okay?

25:44.265 --> 25:46.267
Listen to your body,
if it's uncomfortable,

25:46.351 --> 25:47.352
you just push
yourself a little bit,

25:47.435 --> 25:48.436
but not to the point of pain.

25:48.853 --> 25:50.104
- Alright?
- Thanks.

25:51.147 --> 25:53.191
Cuz I'm pretty inflexible, so...

25:53.525 --> 25:55.985
Well, saying you can't do yoga
cuz you're not flexible is like

25:56.194 --> 25:58.363
saying you can't drink water
because you're too thirsty!

26:01.741 --> 26:04.327
Oh, I'm Wendy.
If you need anything.

26:04.869 --> 26:05.870
I'm R...

26:06.788 --> 26:08.790
- Rick.
- Nice to meet you Rick.

26:11.251 --> 26:14.128
And on an inhale,
raise those hands

26:14.212 --> 26:16.506
up into the air, over your head,

26:16.589 --> 26:20.718
in a simple back extension
on an exhale.

26:20.969 --> 26:23.555
Fall forward
into a full forward bend.

26:23.721 --> 26:26.140
Breathe into those hamstrings.

26:26.516 --> 26:29.102
And if your body allows it,
clasp the elbows,

26:29.185 --> 26:31.104
and gently rock back and forth.

26:31.479 --> 26:32.480
And on an exhale,

26:32.564 --> 26:35.316
I want you to either jump
or step back to a plank.

26:36.943 --> 26:39.279
Make your way into Chaturanga.

26:39.529 --> 26:42.532
You're going to keep
your elbows facing inwards

26:42.657 --> 26:45.535
and up into
an upward facing dog.

26:45.618 --> 26:48.079
We're gonna lift the spine
up out of the pelvis

26:48.162 --> 26:50.123
to create space
between the vertebrae.

26:54.919 --> 26:57.297
And really just
focus on your breath here.

26:57.422 --> 26:59.716
A really deep child's pose.

26:59.799 --> 27:01.342
Breathe into the hips.

27:01.801 --> 27:03.511
Arms straight in front of you.

27:03.803 --> 27:07.182
Yoga is the best way to prevent
injury if you're very active.

27:07.974 --> 27:09.726
If you play sports?

27:10.143 --> 27:11.936
- I don't, no.
- Oh, well.

27:12.061 --> 27:13.813
All the more reason
to practice regularly.

27:13.938 --> 27:15.273
You spend
too much time sedentary,

27:15.356 --> 27:17.066
your body starts to compress.

27:19.527 --> 27:20.528
- Bye, Wendy.
- Bye!

27:23.573 --> 27:25.617
What do
you do for a living, Rick?

28:17.919 --> 28:20.922
Is this the hidden
camera video of Morgan?

28:21.130 --> 28:22.173
Yep.

28:22.674 --> 28:26.052
- You know it's utterly unusable.
- I know.

28:27.262 --> 28:30.348
Well, it's okay kid. At least
you know how to turn it on.

28:31.140 --> 28:32.225
Yeah, thanks Joe.

28:37.647 --> 28:38.648
Ray.

28:40.358 --> 28:42.068
Don't beat
yourself up over this.

28:43.945 --> 28:45.989
You see these worker's comps,

28:46.072 --> 28:48.575
attorneys,
they have what they call,

28:49.200 --> 28:50.952
"the good day defence".

28:53.037 --> 28:56.457
You gotta have repeated activity
over a long period of time

28:56.541 --> 28:59.627
to even hope
for a reduction in benefits,

29:00.545 --> 29:02.046
let alone a dismissal.

29:03.965 --> 29:06.384
Let alone a fucking prosecution

29:06.467 --> 29:08.845
in this state of
communist California.

29:09.470 --> 29:12.473
- What is she's lying?
- So what? Good for her.

29:13.016 --> 29:14.350
How else is she gonna survive?

29:14.434 --> 29:16.102
She saw an opportunity
and she took it.

29:16.227 --> 29:17.604
It wouldn't be right, Joe.

29:18.062 --> 29:19.063
What...

29:19.731 --> 29:20.732
You know, Ray,

29:20.899 --> 29:24.110
when you're a single mom
with no college education,

29:24.319 --> 29:25.904
then I'll listen to you

29:26.112 --> 29:28.823
tell me what is wrong
and what is right.

29:29.157 --> 29:31.159
Yeah well, I didn't
go to college either, Joe!

29:31.492 --> 29:33.077
Look at me, I'm here.

29:33.494 --> 29:34.704
I'm in this shithole.

29:34.787 --> 29:36.206
I'm making a paycheck.

29:36.289 --> 29:38.249
Because you're a fucking sucker.

29:38.541 --> 29:39.959
- That's why.
- Well, so are you!

29:40.168 --> 29:41.502
You're goddamn right, I am.

29:44.214 --> 29:45.882
But I have accepted...

29:47.383 --> 29:50.470
the pointlessness
of my non-existence.

29:52.889 --> 29:56.017
I have accepted
that this is who I am,

29:56.392 --> 29:57.936
that all I ever will be.

29:59.812 --> 30:01.022
Everyday is...

30:02.273 --> 30:05.360
the best day of my life
and the worst day of my life.

30:14.702 --> 30:16.371
You should quit, Ray.

30:17.622 --> 30:19.624
Unless this is what you want.

30:22.835 --> 30:23.962
Look at me, Ray!

30:24.254 --> 30:26.756
I am your fucking endgame!

30:28.132 --> 30:29.676
This is where you will end up!

30:47.569 --> 30:48.570
Hey.

30:49.654 --> 30:51.865
So, I just
go in the waiting room?

30:52.198 --> 30:54.367
You think you just
might possibly manage that?

30:54.450 --> 30:55.451
I mean...

30:55.702 --> 30:56.703
Yeah.

30:57.537 --> 30:59.622
What if they
ask me why I'm there?

30:59.998 --> 31:02.208
It's a waiting room.
You're waiting for someone.

31:02.876 --> 31:04.043
Alright. Okay.

31:05.003 --> 31:06.588
Well, who am I waiting for?

31:06.880 --> 31:08.047
Who fucking cares?

31:08.464 --> 31:11.342
So, we stay till 3,
and then we call it a day.

31:11.676 --> 31:13.052
Okay, yeah. Sounds good.

31:15.722 --> 31:16.723
Hey Ray.

31:17.724 --> 31:20.018
You ever heard of
the Great Pacific Garbage Patch?

31:20.435 --> 31:21.436
Um...

31:21.978 --> 31:23.354
Is that a heavy metal band?

31:23.521 --> 31:25.148
It's a floating island of trash

31:25.231 --> 31:27.108
somewhere between
the U.S and Asia.

31:28.234 --> 31:29.527
Miles in diameter.

31:30.153 --> 31:32.363
Made of plastic shit
people have thrown away.

31:32.989 --> 31:36.492
When the plastic decomposes,
it turns into toxic sludge,

31:36.784 --> 31:38.661
which ends up
in the digestive system

31:38.745 --> 31:40.121
of millions of sea animals.

31:40.705 --> 31:42.415
The funniest thing
about the island,

31:42.916 --> 31:46.044
is that because it's literally
in the middle of the ocean,

31:47.295 --> 31:50.006
no country wants
to take responsibility for it.

31:50.757 --> 31:53.718
So it just gets bigger
and bigger everyday.

31:59.807 --> 32:01.518
- Wait a sec.
- What?

32:01.768 --> 32:03.728
- I think I saw him.
- Saleh?

32:04.103 --> 32:05.104
Yeah.

32:05.480 --> 32:07.899
He was leaving,
not coming though.

32:08.316 --> 32:11.194
It's only 1:15,
there's no chance it was him.

32:11.569 --> 32:13.071
But it was him, Joe.

32:13.738 --> 32:15.740
If you really
think you saw him,

32:15.823 --> 32:17.158
go check the sign-in sheet.

32:26.251 --> 32:27.252
Hi.

32:33.424 --> 32:34.425
Shit.

32:35.176 --> 32:37.011
I'm sure it was fucking him.

32:51.484 --> 32:52.485
Come on.

32:58.575 --> 32:59.576
Shit.

33:04.831 --> 33:05.832
Fuck.

33:18.219 --> 33:19.596
He's in the garage.

33:20.180 --> 33:21.472
He's getting in his car.

33:21.639 --> 33:23.391
You need to see
what car he gets into.

33:24.350 --> 33:27.520
It's a Jaguar.
Newer model. Gray.

33:27.937 --> 33:28.938
Plate?

33:29.606 --> 33:32.025
It's got a dealer plates on it.
Gray as well. So...

33:32.567 --> 33:34.194
Get your
ass back down here.

33:35.778 --> 33:39.240
I can't believe he showed up.
The white fucking whale!

33:42.076 --> 33:43.661
You're finally
gonna get him, Joe!

33:44.370 --> 33:47.123
I'm so glad
I'm with you on this, cuz,

33:47.540 --> 33:49.792
tailing is definitely not one
of my strong suits, you know.

33:49.876 --> 33:53.755
I feel like it makes me
uncertain about it all and shit.

33:55.089 --> 33:57.592
I never know how far
or how close I need to be

33:57.675 --> 33:58.676
when I'm tailing.

33:58.760 --> 34:01.554
But I'm good at the
pretexting and stuff, but shit!

34:02.514 --> 34:03.681
Joe, I know this though.

34:03.765 --> 34:05.016
If it were me
tailing him right now,

34:05.099 --> 34:06.559
and I was this far away,
I'd probably lose him.

34:06.643 --> 34:07.727
You might wanna
get a little closer.

34:07.810 --> 34:09.521
Shut up!

34:10.855 --> 34:13.149
Sorry Joe, I'm a little high
right now, you know.

34:14.317 --> 34:15.318
What?

34:15.860 --> 34:18.612
I mean, I'm really nervous.

34:22.742 --> 34:23.868
Well, don't be.

34:25.745 --> 34:27.746
God, what the fuck is this?

34:27.830 --> 34:29.206
Come on!

34:29.290 --> 34:30.291
God, what the fuck!

34:31.626 --> 34:33.378
Nah, man. There's
a fucking dog on the street.

34:36.130 --> 34:37.130
What?

34:37.215 --> 34:39.509
Yeah, there's a fucking dog
in the street blocking traffic.

34:43.137 --> 34:44.138
Wait here.

34:44.304 --> 34:45.598
Joe,
what the fuck are you doing?

34:45.681 --> 34:46.683
Wait here.

34:48.016 --> 34:49.018
Damn it!

34:57.986 --> 34:59.112
Oh god.

35:01.322 --> 35:02.365
Joe!

35:02.615 --> 35:03.658
What are you doing?

35:04.951 --> 35:06.619
Don't put the dog in here, man!

35:06.703 --> 35:07.704
What the fuck!

35:08.580 --> 35:10.415
Dude, what the fuck is
with the dog in the car, man!

35:10.498 --> 35:12.000
- What if he bites?
- He doesn't!

35:12.625 --> 35:13.626
How do you know?

35:13.793 --> 35:15.587
We're gonna lose him, Joe!
What the fuck!

35:16.629 --> 35:18.840
You know, I know
I'm new at this whole thing,

35:18.923 --> 35:21.217
but, I mean
I'm really confused, Joe.

35:22.635 --> 35:25.180
I mean, I think we might've had
a lot of attention drawn on us.

35:25.263 --> 35:26.764
We could've
easily have lost him.

35:27.348 --> 35:28.850
Yeah. Maybe.

35:29.142 --> 35:30.643
I mean,
this is a stray fucking dog.

35:30.727 --> 35:32.061
There's millions
of them in this area.

35:32.145 --> 35:33.980
Would you shut the fuck up?

35:34.647 --> 35:36.065
Listen to me, you little shit.

35:36.191 --> 35:37.942
We need to get
something straight, right now.

35:38.359 --> 35:40.570
Pat told me to show you
the ropes, and I am.

35:41.029 --> 35:43.489
But you need to understand
that I hate this fucking job.

35:44.365 --> 35:45.742
I hate driving in this car.

35:46.242 --> 35:47.660
I hate the people I work with.

35:47.911 --> 35:48.995
I hate tailing.

35:49.245 --> 35:51.206
I hate this fucking city.

35:51.497 --> 35:53.499
I hate everyone in it.
And I hate you!

35:56.920 --> 35:58.922
If I don't get video on a case,

35:59.047 --> 36:00.298
I feel like shit.

36:00.381 --> 36:03.551
And then even when I do
get video, I feel even shittier.

36:04.802 --> 36:06.763
I make shit money.

36:08.056 --> 36:09.265
Living in this little

36:09.849 --> 36:12.143
fucking apartment
in North Hollywood,

36:12.352 --> 36:14.812
next to some
drug dealing nigger,

36:14.896 --> 36:18.274
and some
dumbass bitch from Ohio

36:18.816 --> 36:21.402
who thinks she's gonna
make it as a movie star.

36:22.195 --> 36:23.196
Jesus.

36:24.906 --> 36:26.491
I got no college education.

36:30.578 --> 36:31.955
I got no family.

36:40.338 --> 36:42.215
What I got
is high blood pressure.

36:43.132 --> 36:45.260
They have me on
this fucking Hydroton for years

36:45.343 --> 36:46.553
and now I'm on Dyazide,

36:46.636 --> 36:48.721
and if I don't take it,
I feel like shit everyday.

36:51.850 --> 36:53.059
I'll tell you something.

36:53.142 --> 36:55.395
I have been on
the Saleh case for ten years.

36:55.478 --> 36:56.479
Ten years!

36:56.855 --> 36:58.314
And we may have
lost him back there,

36:58.398 --> 37:00.316
but I don't really
give a good goddamn.

37:00.733 --> 37:02.819
Let that camel jockey
milk the system.

37:03.653 --> 37:07.156
Let Powell Insurance's stock
drop a millionth of a point.

37:07.282 --> 37:08.616
Who really cares?

37:10.535 --> 37:11.536
But look!

37:11.619 --> 37:13.246
Look! This is a living creature.

37:14.455 --> 37:15.582
He's scared.

37:16.165 --> 37:17.166
He's hungry.

37:18.251 --> 37:19.419
He's alone.

37:20.169 --> 37:22.839
And by god,
I'm gonna save his life.

37:28.303 --> 37:29.762
What else really matters?

37:39.772 --> 37:40.773
Eat it!

37:43.610 --> 37:46.237
I mean, it was
just the latest in a series

37:46.321 --> 37:49.199
of strange events that's been
happening in my life, you know.

37:49.282 --> 37:50.283
Totally.

37:52.285 --> 37:54.370
Then, what happened
last week at rustic...

37:56.206 --> 37:57.582
I started doubting everything.

37:58.625 --> 37:59.918
Like, reality.

38:00.877 --> 38:02.670
I felt very certain.

38:06.507 --> 38:08.009
And then
the shit with my mom...

38:08.092 --> 38:09.802
I'm really stressed out, man.

38:12.013 --> 38:13.014
Yeah.

38:15.725 --> 38:17.977
Like, Joe...

38:20.355 --> 38:22.941
Shit, it's like,
how's he even possible?

38:25.652 --> 38:26.653
A guy like that?

38:27.737 --> 38:28.947
How does he even exist?

38:34.369 --> 38:35.537
He's really racist.

38:38.331 --> 38:39.582
That's fucked up, man.

38:40.124 --> 38:43.294
I mean, he's racist
towards everyone.

38:43.586 --> 38:44.587
Like,

38:45.004 --> 38:47.215
I don't think his hatred

38:47.507 --> 38:49.133
even has
a specific direction, you know?

38:51.010 --> 38:52.095
Still, I mean...

38:52.428 --> 38:55.306
He goes on these
crazy-ass rants... I dunno.

38:57.350 --> 38:58.351
What?

39:00.854 --> 39:02.814
- What? Who is it?
- It's him!

39:03.147 --> 39:04.148
It's Joe!

39:04.232 --> 39:05.650
Answer, bro! Put it on speaker.

39:05.733 --> 39:06.985
- No...
- Dude, answer it!

39:07.068 --> 39:08.069
I wanna hear him.

39:08.695 --> 39:10.488
- Alright.
- Dude, I won't say a word.

39:11.698 --> 39:13.575
- Hey Joe.
- Hi Ray.

39:14.784 --> 39:16.035
What's up, man?
Everything cool?

39:16.828 --> 39:17.829
Nothing's cool.

39:18.538 --> 39:19.539
Yeah?

39:21.124 --> 39:23.793
Hey, how did
it go with the dog?

39:23.918 --> 39:25.879
Well, he's good, I think.

39:26.045 --> 39:28.673
I had to take him all the way
down to Anaheim.

39:28.923 --> 39:31.134
One of the only
no-kill shelters in the area.

39:31.342 --> 39:32.427
He had fleas.

39:32.677 --> 39:34.053
Was a little malnourished.

39:34.304 --> 39:35.597
But no diseases or anything.

39:35.805 --> 39:37.974
I think there's a good
chance he'll get adopted.

39:38.057 --> 39:39.058
I hope so.

39:39.309 --> 39:40.518
I paid to have him groomed.

39:40.935 --> 39:43.146
Well,
that's really good of you, man.

39:44.230 --> 39:47.734
Uh, I really think someone
is gonna snatch him up.

39:49.819 --> 39:50.820
Yeah.

39:50.945 --> 39:54.282
Sometimes, when I'm
sitting in the traffic on the 5,

39:54.699 --> 39:56.117
I close my eyes.

39:56.326 --> 39:57.452
I feel the heat.

39:58.161 --> 40:00.538
I listen to the wind
outside my car.

40:01.039 --> 40:03.750
And I imagine
I am in the Sargasso Sea.

40:04.918 --> 40:05.919
You know what that is?

40:06.169 --> 40:08.338
In ancient times,
there was an area of the ocean

40:08.421 --> 40:10.298
where seaweed grew
tall and thick,

40:10.548 --> 40:12.509
and boats were sail through it
and get snared.

40:12.884 --> 40:13.885
There's no way out.

40:14.177 --> 40:16.137
The crew would then,
starve to death,

40:16.304 --> 40:17.805
and the boats
would just stay there,

40:17.889 --> 40:18.890
unmanned...

40:20.225 --> 40:22.018
Unmanned...
that's pretty deep, man.

40:22.352 --> 40:23.353
I think about

40:23.603 --> 40:25.772
what all of this was
before humans came

40:25.855 --> 40:27.315
and ruined this valley.

40:27.398 --> 40:30.693
I watched birds fly through
the sky that bleeds acid raid.

40:30.818 --> 40:33.655
Tree roots bulge up under
the sidewalks we've laid,

40:33.863 --> 40:37.283
ruining the foundations of the
shitty little houses we built.

40:37.450 --> 40:41.829
That's the only time I feel
anything other than despair.

40:45.542 --> 40:47.585
You should stop
smoking weed, Ray.

40:47.919 --> 40:48.920
Huh?

40:49.587 --> 40:51.005
Doing this job,

40:51.256 --> 40:53.007
it'll make you paranoid enough.

40:54.425 --> 40:55.718
Okay, well...

40:57.220 --> 40:58.221
Alright, Joe.

40:58.388 --> 40:59.764
Have a nice weekend, Ray.

41:00.265 --> 41:01.975
- Yeah, you too, man.
- See you Monday.

41:03.434 --> 41:04.435
The fuck?

41:26.165 --> 41:27.750
I'm just saying that
you have to have real food.

41:27.834 --> 41:28.835
- Okay.
- Okay!

41:29.043 --> 41:30.044
Do you
wanna be that annoying?

41:43.725 --> 41:44.726
That Morgan?

41:45.310 --> 41:46.311
What?

41:46.978 --> 41:48.938
Did you finally
get something on her?

41:50.815 --> 41:51.858
Um, no.

41:52.066 --> 41:56.362
No, this is just the ID photo
they sent, you know.

41:57.906 --> 41:58.907
You know,

42:00.116 --> 42:02.202
you do this job long enough,

42:02.493 --> 42:04.621
you start
to feel like a pervert.

42:05.205 --> 42:08.124
Kinda a funny
phenomenon, actually.

42:08.666 --> 42:13.046
But all the sneaking around,
the lying, spying on people...

42:15.340 --> 42:18.051
That's all for
a good cause, supposedly.

42:18.801 --> 42:21.346
But there's
something that we do,

42:21.554 --> 42:22.847
what our bodies do...

42:23.431 --> 42:25.433
Our bodies
listen to our minds,

42:25.558 --> 42:28.978
But I think
the opposite is true too.

42:34.359 --> 42:38.071
That's why all these actors and
actresses' marriages fall apart.

42:39.239 --> 42:41.866
They spend all day,
pretending to kiss people,

42:41.991 --> 42:44.160
pretending to fuck,
pretending to be in love,

42:44.285 --> 42:45.537
and then one day...

43:54.814 --> 43:56.232
Ugh, shit.

44:04.282 --> 44:05.950
- Yeah?
- Hey, Joe.

44:07.285 --> 44:09.370
- I'm on the Colleen Morgan case.
- I've

44:10.121 --> 44:12.123
I've been here since seven.

44:12.332 --> 44:14.209
Um, her car is here.

44:14.709 --> 44:15.793
I think she's home.

44:15.960 --> 44:17.003
Um...

44:17.962 --> 44:20.423
Look, um...

44:22.217 --> 44:24.177
I gotta take a shit, man.

44:25.094 --> 44:26.095
What do I do?

44:26.679 --> 44:27.722
Go shit.

44:29.641 --> 44:31.142
- In my car?
- No!

44:31.684 --> 44:33.478
Go shit, man.

44:33.728 --> 44:35.271
Like, go somewhere, and shit.

44:35.480 --> 44:37.440
- Like, a bathroom.
- Okay, go to a bathroom.

44:37.941 --> 44:38.942
Where?

44:39.025 --> 44:40.985
Haven't I taught you
about shitting yet?

44:41.361 --> 44:42.362
No.

44:42.654 --> 44:46.699
Well, if you gotta shit,
be a man and do what you can.

44:46.908 --> 44:49.452
A lot of it depends
on the area and the day.

44:50.036 --> 44:52.038
When you're desperate
and have no other option,

44:52.121 --> 44:53.831
the last resort
is a gas-station.

44:54.123 --> 44:56.918
You want to avoid diners
and cheap restaurants too.

44:57.001 --> 44:59.295
They're usually small,
dirty, and crowded.

44:59.420 --> 45:01.881
The worst ones
have serious gap issues.

45:02.257 --> 45:04.008
Gap issues?

45:04.175 --> 45:07.720
The walls of the stall
aren't set together properly,

45:07.804 --> 45:09.347
so when someone comes in,

45:09.430 --> 45:11.391
they're looking you right
in the eyes while you shit.

45:13.101 --> 45:15.478
Oh yeah. I hate that, man.

45:15.645 --> 45:16.896
Yeah, everybody does.

45:16.980 --> 45:19.440
Beware of the walls
of the stalls.

45:19.524 --> 45:21.317
What you want is a Starbucks.

45:21.401 --> 45:23.361
Now, that's the
gold standard of shitting.

45:23.778 --> 45:25.405
When it's very late,
or very early,

45:25.488 --> 45:27.240
or if there's
no Starbucks around,

45:27.407 --> 45:29.200
one of my favorite
shitting locations

45:29.367 --> 45:30.618
is a motel lobby.

45:30.702 --> 45:32.245
No questions. Usually empty.

45:32.495 --> 45:33.621
Usually clean.

45:34.122 --> 45:36.291
Well, those are
your options though.

45:36.374 --> 45:40.044
Well, I saw a coffee shop
on the way in here, so...

45:41.170 --> 45:43.214
I'm gonna take a shit there.

45:43.298 --> 45:44.299
Thanks.

46:10.366 --> 46:11.618
You work Morgan today?

46:13.077 --> 46:14.078
Yeah.

46:15.079 --> 46:16.748
- And?
- Nothing yet.

46:16.998 --> 46:17.999
Well...

46:18.875 --> 46:20.376
Maybe I should get Joe on it,

46:20.460 --> 46:21.920
he might be able
to make something happen.

46:22.045 --> 46:24.380
No, no! It's fine. I can...

46:25.006 --> 46:27.008
I got this.
I can handle it. I just...

46:28.676 --> 46:29.928
I know she's fucking home,

46:30.720 --> 46:32.347
I just need her to do something,
you know what I mean?

46:32.430 --> 46:33.890
- You do a pretext?
- Yeah.

46:34.057 --> 46:35.225
- Anything?
- Nada.

46:35.475 --> 46:36.476
She didn't answer.

46:36.809 --> 46:38.269
But, I know she's home.

46:39.020 --> 46:41.564
Well, we gotta
get something on her.

46:42.398 --> 46:45.443
I talked to Juan today at Aegis.
They want to deny her claim.

46:45.902 --> 46:47.237
She's supposed to be unable

46:47.320 --> 46:49.113
to raise her arms
above her shoulders.

46:49.197 --> 46:51.241
She's got
a young daughter too...

46:52.033 --> 46:54.285
Well, they think
she's gotta be lifting the kid.

46:55.328 --> 46:56.996
Well, I'll talk to Juan again.

46:57.080 --> 46:58.748
See if he has anything
else on her that'll help.

46:59.415 --> 47:01.334
- Hey! Joe.
- Pat.

47:03.586 --> 47:05.755
You gotta stop the coffee, man.

47:05.964 --> 47:07.340
It's terrible for you.

47:08.216 --> 47:09.425
You smell like cigarettes.

47:09.676 --> 47:11.511
Are you smoking again?

47:11.761 --> 47:12.846
I never quit.

47:13.054 --> 47:14.055
Uh-huh.

47:15.682 --> 47:16.975
This fucking guy.

47:17.100 --> 47:19.811
He'll have a heart attack.
Drop dead. Then he'll be happy.

47:20.728 --> 47:22.856
Did you know that I trained him?

47:23.064 --> 47:24.816
- Really?
- Yeah, just like you.

47:26.109 --> 47:28.444
That's what you got
to look forward to one day.

47:50.758 --> 47:54.262
I want you
to visualize perfection.

47:55.221 --> 47:56.347
For yourself.

47:57.473 --> 48:00.185
And for everyone around you.

48:01.644 --> 48:05.106
I want you
to visualize a white light,

48:05.523 --> 48:07.358
coursing through your body.

48:08.151 --> 48:11.863
Hold it in your hand, and pass
it off to your neighbor.

48:13.114 --> 48:14.657
Live in it together.

48:30.340 --> 48:31.591
Are you okay?

48:32.342 --> 48:34.093
Yeah, I am. I'm fine.

48:37.430 --> 48:38.431
Mommy!

48:39.516 --> 48:42.810
You are so heavy!

48:43.311 --> 48:44.896
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

48:46.272 --> 48:48.316
- Can we get pizza?
- Duh!

48:48.399 --> 48:49.901
And donuts?

49:11.047 --> 49:13.341
Oh, there you are.

49:13.841 --> 49:15.677
- This yours?
- Yeah, one of them.

49:16.636 --> 49:19.055
- This is Shelly.
- Nice to meet you, Shelly.

49:20.473 --> 49:23.393
So, wait. They don't care
that you

49:23.476 --> 49:26.020
bring your dog to work
on the weekends?

49:29.649 --> 49:30.942
Jesus, you alright, Joe?

49:31.901 --> 49:33.236
God, who knows?

49:33.361 --> 49:35.697
Can you believe I used
to be a half decent athlete?

49:36.656 --> 49:37.657
Really?

49:37.782 --> 49:40.618
I used to play basketball
at the YMCA in Hollywood.

49:40.743 --> 49:43.705
I blocked
Stan Brundy's shot once.

49:45.498 --> 49:46.624
You know who that is?

49:47.166 --> 49:48.918
No.

49:49.419 --> 49:51.004
I don't really
follow sports much.

49:51.504 --> 49:52.505
Oh.

49:56.134 --> 49:57.177
I dunno.

49:58.261 --> 49:59.846
I'm too scared to even jog now.

50:01.181 --> 50:02.682
Afraid I'll have a heart attack,

50:02.765 --> 50:04.267
fall down on the side walk dead!

50:04.976 --> 50:07.270
I don't really think
that happens very much, Joe.

50:09.105 --> 50:10.315
Sure it does.

50:11.649 --> 50:13.443
The silent killer...
they call it.

50:15.361 --> 50:16.404
Yeah... Well...

50:18.823 --> 50:20.366
my dad's got high pressure.

50:22.202 --> 50:23.912
But he's still alive,
the prick!

50:25.955 --> 50:28.041
Lives way out there,
in Riverside.

50:28.124 --> 50:30.585
That wasteland suburb
of serial killers,

50:30.668 --> 50:31.669
meth heads and...

50:32.253 --> 50:34.839
other assorted
and sundry highway trash.

50:36.132 --> 50:38.843
He smokes, he drinks,
he doesn't take care of himself.

50:39.636 --> 50:41.429
But he's still kicking...
the bastard!

50:41.804 --> 50:42.805
Damn!

50:44.390 --> 50:45.558
Oh well...

50:47.227 --> 50:48.436
how's that Morgan case?

50:51.231 --> 50:52.565
I'll say it's um...

50:54.192 --> 50:55.235
uneventful.

50:57.654 --> 50:58.947
Hey, how's Saleh Saleh?

50:59.531 --> 51:01.574
Well, he's vanished
into the mists again!

51:05.078 --> 51:07.789
He's not at that house we
tailed him to. Fucking prick!

51:11.876 --> 51:12.877
Fuck!

51:12.961 --> 51:13.962
Oh well...

51:29.727 --> 51:30.728
Hello.

51:32.021 --> 51:33.022
Yeah.

51:34.524 --> 51:36.109
Alright, okay.

51:44.534 --> 51:46.744
There's Ray.
Come in.

51:50.623 --> 51:53.585
What part of "look presentable"
did you not understand?

51:53.668 --> 51:56.379
I uh... did... my best.

51:59.424 --> 52:01.467
Right... right.

52:03.094 --> 52:04.095
Hat!

52:04.929 --> 52:06.639
Fortunately for you...

52:06.723 --> 52:09.475
Earl and Juan,
are old friends of mine so...

52:09.559 --> 52:11.019
they don't really give a shit.

52:11.978 --> 52:14.189
Earl, Juan,
the new guy, Ray.

52:14.272 --> 52:16.482
How you doing Ray.

52:17.483 --> 52:19.736
Still don't know why Joe
isn't in on this?

52:19.819 --> 52:21.571
Well Joe is still...

52:22.864 --> 52:24.657
tied up on Saleh Saleh.

52:25.116 --> 52:27.911
Saleh Saleh! Fuck me...
that case is still going?

52:27.994 --> 52:29.704
The guy is a fucking
cockroach,

52:29.787 --> 52:31.289
what do you want me to tell you?

52:33.249 --> 52:34.334
Speaking of which...

52:35.126 --> 52:37.212
Earl and Juan are seeing
the case managers,

52:37.295 --> 52:39.339
of Aegis who are overseeing the
Morgan case.

52:39.422 --> 52:42.008
I think I told you that they're
gonna want a briefing,

52:42.091 --> 52:43.426
on the investigation so far.

52:43.510 --> 52:44.552
Right, um...

52:45.845 --> 52:47.096
well... uh ha.

52:50.433 --> 52:53.061
Honestly, I really
don't have anything on her yet.

52:53.144 --> 52:54.521
Well that's okay...
I mean...

52:54.896 --> 52:55.897
plenty of time.

52:57.148 --> 53:00.151
She's a real piece of work,
Colleen Morgan.

53:00.235 --> 53:02.529
You know, she's got
a history of claims,

53:02.654 --> 53:04.239
going back almost a decade.

53:04.322 --> 53:05.657
She got a pattern.

53:05.740 --> 53:07.283
Getting hired
and getting fired.

53:07.367 --> 53:10.995
Hitting her employer post term
with everything under the sun.

53:11.204 --> 53:13.706
From uh... soft tissue crap
to...

53:13.790 --> 53:16.251
anxiety from sexual
harassment...

53:16.334 --> 53:17.627
You know...

53:18.211 --> 53:20.588
I remember when
her ass was two words...

53:21.839 --> 53:23.716
Yeah. Have you seen
her yet Ray?

53:23.800 --> 53:25.760
Ms Morgan her ass...
it's really good!

53:26.219 --> 53:28.137
Huh! That's a good thing
to know...

53:28.221 --> 53:30.974
This bitch is doing yoga!
We just know it!

53:31.057 --> 53:34.227
Maybe other shit too...
Maybe... uh, pilates?

53:34.310 --> 53:36.229
We get her doing
just anything,

53:36.312 --> 53:37.897
it'll help us with our
settlement.

53:37.981 --> 53:39.691
Cause she's saying
with the anxiety,

53:39.774 --> 53:41.401
she's got...
sexual dysfunction.

53:41.609 --> 53:43.319
Oh, hey Ray.

53:44.571 --> 53:45.572
Could you fuck her?

53:45.655 --> 53:46.781
And then video it?

53:46.906 --> 53:49.909
Just for use as ...evidence
in the deposition of course.

53:49.993 --> 53:51.536
Juan...

53:51.661 --> 53:54.789
I think,
that might be entrapment.

53:54.873 --> 53:57.000
Alright,
maybe just a blow job then...

53:59.252 --> 54:01.254
In all seriousness though Ray...

54:01.337 --> 54:04.465
don't have any contact
with her at all.

54:04.549 --> 54:07.093
Not that we need
to mention that obviously.

54:07.177 --> 54:08.303
Obviously.

54:10.054 --> 54:11.890
Her attorney is
Don Kerrigan.

54:11.973 --> 54:15.226
And that fucking vulture
will use anything.

54:15.310 --> 54:17.312
You ever had
to testify Ray?

54:20.607 --> 54:22.233
No... uh...

54:23.109 --> 54:24.819
not yet. I... um...

54:25.778 --> 54:27.947
I... I gave video to
a lawyer once.

54:28.323 --> 54:30.700
Um, but the case went to
settlement,

54:30.783 --> 54:32.493
before I was
actually needed.

54:32.577 --> 54:34.579
Well hopefully this won't
come to that.

54:34.662 --> 54:36.831
Cause Kerrigan...

54:37.248 --> 54:39.083
will tear you a new one!

54:41.419 --> 54:43.755
Anyway, you've been
on her a week right so uh...

54:43.838 --> 54:45.173
what you got so far?

54:45.548 --> 54:47.842
What? No.
You guys don't understand.

54:50.762 --> 54:53.139
Well... what do you want
me to do?

54:53.223 --> 54:56.184
I mean you guys ain't gonna do
that and I appreciate it, but...

54:56.392 --> 54:58.228
what if she... um...

54:59.604 --> 55:01.689
Oh, okay, so it falls
on my shoulders then.

55:03.483 --> 55:05.068
I don't have any credit cards.

55:07.237 --> 55:08.738
I don't think I'd qualify.

55:11.491 --> 55:13.326
Crowd sourcing, what the fuck
is that?

55:15.787 --> 55:18.831
I don't think that's going to
be an option for me.

55:22.460 --> 55:23.461
Right.

55:23.878 --> 55:25.338
I mean, that'll help,
I guess,

55:25.421 --> 55:26.422
but the thing is...

55:27.006 --> 55:29.008
it's not that I can't
afford that bill...

55:29.300 --> 55:30.969
it's that I cant afford
ANY bill.

56:53.134 --> 56:55.637
Hey, can I
have another please. Thank you.

56:58.139 --> 56:59.891
Hey.

56:59.974 --> 57:01.267
Howdy.

57:03.478 --> 57:04.854
You're Colleen Morgan right?

57:05.605 --> 57:06.731
Do I know you?

57:06.814 --> 57:07.982
No.

57:08.066 --> 57:09.275
No.

57:10.109 --> 57:12.028
Okay.

57:22.121 --> 57:24.374
I wanna talk to you
about your disability case.

57:25.542 --> 57:26.584
Excuse me.

57:26.668 --> 57:28.503
I'm a private investigator.

57:28.586 --> 57:30.421
I was hired by
Aegis insurance company,

57:30.505 --> 57:31.923
to do surveillance on you.

57:32.006 --> 57:33.007
What?

57:33.091 --> 57:34.092
To get evidence.

57:34.175 --> 57:36.010
To show that you're
not really injured.

57:36.094 --> 57:37.804
Okay, get the fuck away from me.

57:37.887 --> 57:39.472
No. I wanna help you.

57:39.722 --> 57:40.974
I'm calling my lawyer.

57:41.516 --> 57:42.725
Colleen, please, look.

57:43.142 --> 57:45.019
I can get in a ton of trouble
for this.

57:45.103 --> 57:46.646
But I actually want to help you.

57:48.356 --> 57:50.191
It's just a huge fucking risk!

57:53.862 --> 57:55.697
is this really
the best time?

57:55.780 --> 57:57.073
Maybe not...

57:58.199 --> 57:59.951
but, I know that this place...

58:00.034 --> 58:01.995
none of the people I work with
come here.

58:04.497 --> 58:06.332
Okay... um...

58:06.416 --> 58:08.668
can you just like...
give me a second.

58:08.751 --> 58:10.837
Oh yeah, absolutely.

58:21.723 --> 58:23.600
Can I have another one
of these please.

58:30.440 --> 58:31.774
You know what,
make it two...

58:31.858 --> 58:32.859
one.

58:32.942 --> 58:34.068
Just one.

58:36.738 --> 58:38.781
This is a great idea,
I think...

58:38.865 --> 58:40.408
I don't see why
it wouldn't work.

58:41.117 --> 58:43.494
Yeah, I don't know.
It feels really shady to me...

58:43.786 --> 58:46.539
Well I been doing surveillance
on you for over a month now,

58:46.623 --> 58:48.124
your case it's... it's bullshit.

58:48.249 --> 58:50.376
Yeah well.
I don't need your help.

58:51.544 --> 58:52.712
I've been on you...

58:52.795 --> 58:54.214
I've seen you.
You're not hurt.

58:55.340 --> 58:56.799
Maybe you are...

58:56.883 --> 58:58.635
but not...
like you're claiming to be.

58:58.718 --> 59:00.345
Kerrigan says our case looks
solid.

59:00.637 --> 59:02.222
This is makes it
more than solid.

59:02.555 --> 59:03.556
it's un-losable.

59:04.641 --> 59:06.434
There's nothing Kerrigan
can present,

59:06.518 --> 59:07.936
that can help you more
than me.

59:08.853 --> 59:10.563
I mean, I'm hired
by the other side,

59:10.688 --> 59:11.981
to gather evidence.

59:12.690 --> 59:13.775
You understand?

59:15.026 --> 59:17.195
How do you not get it?
You have the power here.

59:18.363 --> 59:20.823
You know, you can call Kerrigan
at any point

59:22.158 --> 59:23.576
Stop all this, you know.

59:23.868 --> 59:25.245
I can't tell anyone about it.

59:25.328 --> 59:27.789
I'm the one who proposed it,
you can deny everything,

59:27.872 --> 59:28.873
I'd be fucked.

59:28.957 --> 59:31.459
Why would you do this then
if it's so risky for you?

59:37.215 --> 59:38.258
I need money.

59:39.634 --> 59:41.135
There's other ways to get money.

59:41.219 --> 59:42.220
Clearly.

59:43.137 --> 59:45.306
Okay. Well then,
just do what I did.

59:45.390 --> 59:46.891
And file a worker's comp claim.

59:47.308 --> 59:49.394
I haven't been with
the company long enough.

59:52.564 --> 59:54.023
What do you need the money for?

59:57.527 --> 59:58.570
My mom...

59:59.988 --> 01:00:01.489
she's... she's sick.

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:04.367
No insurance.

01:00:06.619 --> 01:00:08.413
Okay, so if we tried this...

01:00:10.456 --> 01:00:12.083
I can shut it down at any time?

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:16.546
Yeah! I mean at any point
you can call Kerrigan.

01:00:18.089 --> 01:00:19.507
Call it off.

01:00:20.758 --> 01:00:21.926
Here's the thing...

01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:24.095
they'll just put another
investigator on you.

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.805
Sooner or later you'd slip up.

01:00:25.889 --> 01:00:28.057
And again your case
would be fucked.

01:00:29.767 --> 01:00:30.935
If we do this...

01:00:31.936 --> 01:00:34.564
and we go this route,
we do it right,

01:00:34.647 --> 01:00:35.648
and we're careful.

01:00:37.775 --> 01:00:38.902
I promise,

01:00:38.985 --> 01:00:40.028
everybody wins.

01:00:42.071 --> 01:00:43.740
Everybody except
Aegis insurance.

01:00:44.407 --> 01:00:45.909
Yeah well,
fuck those guys.

01:00:46.701 --> 01:00:48.453
I was there a few days ago
with them,

01:00:48.536 --> 01:00:50.163
they don't give a shit
about you.

01:00:50.997 --> 01:00:53.708
In fact they told me to
be careful with this case,

01:00:53.791 --> 01:00:55.585
not to make any contact
with you.

01:01:07.347 --> 01:01:08.348
Alright.

01:01:09.265 --> 01:01:11.226
- Alright?
- I'm not saying yes but...

01:01:12.519 --> 01:01:13.645
If I did.

01:01:14.979 --> 01:01:15.980
What'll we do?

01:01:16.064 --> 01:01:17.941
Well uh... simple.

01:01:18.024 --> 01:01:19.734
You'd do what you normally do.

01:01:19.817 --> 01:01:22.111
Well, you know,
do what you'd normally do,

01:01:22.195 --> 01:01:23.655
if you were actually injured.

01:01:24.197 --> 01:01:26.157
Cause ah... you know,
for this to work...

01:01:26.908 --> 01:01:27.992
for them to buy in...

01:01:28.409 --> 01:01:29.619
it's gotta be a lot...

01:01:30.411 --> 01:01:33.122
like, over a period of weeks...
maybe even months,

01:01:33.206 --> 01:01:34.916
different times of day,

01:01:37.669 --> 01:01:39.003
different days of the week.

01:01:43.299 --> 01:01:45.718
Then you know...
keep going you know.

01:01:45.969 --> 01:01:49.180
Um... they'll... they'll keep
asking me for some footage,

01:01:49.264 --> 01:01:50.598
Video and stuff.

01:01:50.974 --> 01:01:52.559
I'll give them footage of you,

01:01:53.393 --> 01:01:54.978
and they'll see
that you're hurt.

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:57.730
And then they'll have
to close the case.

01:01:57.814 --> 01:01:59.858
It'll go to... depositions
and what not...

01:02:01.025 --> 01:02:02.360
and they'll have to settle.

01:02:02.443 --> 01:02:05.154
Hopefully you'll get close to
what you're asking for.

01:02:07.574 --> 01:02:08.908
And you'll get 10 per cent?

01:02:10.493 --> 01:02:11.953
It's just a small price to pay.

01:02:53.203 --> 01:02:54.204
- Hey.
- Hey

01:02:58.917 --> 01:03:00.293
Oh...

01:03:00.376 --> 01:03:02.170
so this is how it looks
on the inside.

01:03:04.047 --> 01:03:05.965
Um...
let me get you a drink.

01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:07.133
Yeah, sure.

01:03:22.815 --> 01:03:23.816
Oh, thank you.

01:03:26.319 --> 01:03:27.529
So... uh...

01:03:28.696 --> 01:03:29.948
where's Casey's dad?

01:03:30.657 --> 01:03:31.658
Not here.

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:32.742
Oh.

01:03:33.826 --> 01:03:36.496
I... you know, my dad abandoned
me when I was a kid too...

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:38.706
Okay, maybe we can talk
about something else.

01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:39.832
Right, I'm sorry.

01:03:40.041 --> 01:03:41.042
It's cool.

01:03:42.335 --> 01:03:43.336
Shit!

01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:51.678
Do you like meatballs?

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:53.763
Uh, yeah.

01:03:54.973 --> 01:03:56.015
Yeah. Do you?

01:03:56.099 --> 01:03:57.559
No, I'm a vegetarian.

01:03:57.642 --> 01:03:59.227
The hell you are!

01:03:59.310 --> 01:04:00.645
You said "hell"!

01:04:01.813 --> 01:04:02.981
The "heck" you are!

01:04:03.064 --> 01:04:04.691
You really didn't
have to...

01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:07.151
You're right,

01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:09.112
I wanted to.

01:04:12.073 --> 01:04:13.741
I really appreciate you
helping me.

01:04:16.411 --> 01:04:17.495
You're helping my mom?

01:04:19.038 --> 01:04:20.039
Yes!

01:04:20.123 --> 01:04:22.041
Ray is helping me.

01:04:22.709 --> 01:04:24.335
What are you
helping with?

01:04:25.503 --> 01:04:26.504
Art projects?

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:28.172
Exactly.

01:04:29.465 --> 01:04:30.508
Can I see it?

01:04:30.884 --> 01:04:32.051
When it's done

01:04:32.135 --> 01:04:33.553
- Okay.
- Okay

01:04:37.098 --> 01:04:38.683
That is seriously gross!

01:04:42.437 --> 01:04:44.939
Oh my god what do you do
if you have to poop?

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.441
What?

01:04:46.524 --> 01:04:48.568
Yeah, what do you do?
Do you get like a bag?

01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:50.403
I don't poop in a fucking bag!

01:04:50.486 --> 01:04:51.654
I'm not an animal!

01:04:52.197 --> 01:04:54.657
What would a girl do
if she had to pee?

01:04:54.741 --> 01:04:55.992
I don't know!

01:04:56.117 --> 01:04:57.118
You tell me.

01:04:57.202 --> 01:04:58.328
Pee in a cup!

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:06.294
You know... sometimes
life takes some...

01:05:06.377 --> 01:05:09.005
weird... turns

01:05:11.341 --> 01:05:12.383
Yeah.

01:05:12.675 --> 01:05:14.636
I do appreciate
what you're doing for me.

01:05:15.929 --> 01:05:18.264
I mean I know you're
doing it for your mom...

01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:19.349
and the money and...

01:05:19.891 --> 01:05:22.143
I'm doing it cause I think
you're a good person.

01:05:23.394 --> 01:05:24.395
Am I?

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:29.692
Yeah!

01:05:29.776 --> 01:05:30.777
Yeah?

01:05:31.236 --> 01:05:32.695
Thanks!

01:05:59.264 --> 01:06:00.765
Have you ever been married Joe?

01:06:02.141 --> 01:06:03.184
Yeah, once.

01:06:03.685 --> 01:06:04.894
Yeah?
What happened?

01:06:05.895 --> 01:06:07.856
Well...
you really wanna know?

01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:09.858
I was fucking around on her.

01:06:10.191 --> 01:06:11.860
Oh, shit.

01:06:14.028 --> 01:06:16.364
To this day, I don't
even know why.

01:06:17.115 --> 01:06:19.826
The one woman on this planet,
that could stand me.

01:06:21.286 --> 01:06:23.079
And I wasn't even unhappy.

01:06:23.621 --> 01:06:24.622
Ray!

01:06:24.706 --> 01:06:25.707
Hey Pat.

01:06:25.790 --> 01:06:26.916
Still nothing on Morgan?

01:06:27.166 --> 01:06:28.418
Nah, just um...

01:06:29.294 --> 01:06:30.795
just more of the same,
you know.

01:06:31.546 --> 01:06:33.047
She's really messed up.

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:34.591
Fuck!

01:06:35.508 --> 01:06:37.135
This bill is going
to be enormous!

01:06:38.553 --> 01:06:40.221
Ray, we gotta
get something on her.

01:06:41.222 --> 01:06:42.557
I just point the camera...

01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:45.101
I can't control what it gets.

01:06:46.144 --> 01:06:47.187
Fuck!

01:06:52.692 --> 01:06:54.736
Would you like some help
on this case?

01:06:55.111 --> 01:06:57.280
No. I mean,
nothing I can't handle.

01:06:58.489 --> 01:06:59.657
Suit yourself.

01:07:02.452 --> 01:07:03.578
Can I buy you lunch?

01:07:14.964 --> 01:07:15.965
So?

01:07:19.135 --> 01:07:20.136
I think,

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:24.432
it's the dumbest fucking thing
that anyone has ever done!

01:07:24.641 --> 01:07:27.018
I oughta go up there
and tell Pat right now.

01:07:28.061 --> 01:07:29.729
You'd be royally fucked.

01:07:30.313 --> 01:07:32.148
Yeah, I know.

01:07:34.692 --> 01:07:36.361
Oh shit!

01:07:43.243 --> 01:07:44.244
Tell you the truth,

01:07:44.327 --> 01:07:46.788
I've actually thought of doing
it myself a few times!

01:07:46.871 --> 01:07:48.081
Wait!

01:07:48.915 --> 01:07:50.208
You thought of it...

01:07:50.291 --> 01:07:51.668
so why didn't you do it then?

01:07:52.627 --> 01:07:55.213
Were you scared
you were gonna be caught?

01:07:55.296 --> 01:07:56.381
No, of course not.

01:07:59.259 --> 01:08:01.553
I just don't trust anyone.

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:03.012
Ah.

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:05.181
Like this chick...

01:08:06.558 --> 01:08:08.101
do you really think...

01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:10.687
that she's gonna pay you...

01:08:10.770 --> 01:08:14.107
after she gets her hot little
hands on that cheque?

01:08:15.984 --> 01:08:16.984
I trust her, Joe.

01:08:17.068 --> 01:08:19.654
You don't know
a goddam thing about her...

01:08:19.737 --> 01:08:21.113
Are you kidding me... I've...

01:08:22.407 --> 01:08:23.575
I've been watching her

01:08:23.658 --> 01:08:24.701
every single day.

01:08:25.785 --> 01:08:26.953
I looked her up on line,

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:28.328
she has no criminal record.

01:08:28.412 --> 01:08:29.455
I trust her, okay?

01:08:35.587 --> 01:08:36.754
You stupid idiot!

01:08:37.839 --> 01:08:38.840
You know what,

01:08:38.923 --> 01:08:41.259
you just jealous
that I actually had the balls...

01:08:41.341 --> 01:08:42.343
to do it.

01:08:42.426 --> 01:08:44.053
You probably right.

01:08:53.854 --> 01:08:54.856
Joe...?

01:08:56.024 --> 01:08:57.108
You alright?

01:08:58.568 --> 01:09:00.111
Scared me there for a minute.

01:09:00.194 --> 01:09:01.988
Just a little gas, that's all.

01:09:03.488 --> 01:09:04.948
Jesus Christ man!

01:09:05.033 --> 01:09:08.118
- You scared the shit out of me!
- Yeah

01:09:09.703 --> 01:09:11.080
It's open!

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.421
Where's uh,
where's Casey?

01:09:18.504 --> 01:09:19.796
She'll be here soon.

01:09:19.923 --> 01:09:20.924
She's with Jules.

01:09:21.006 --> 01:09:22.091
Alright?

01:09:22.175 --> 01:09:24.260
I had to meet
with Kerrigan today.

01:09:24.344 --> 01:09:26.011
Which is why
I'm just getting home.

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:29.599
Huh! Okay.

01:09:32.727 --> 01:09:34.979
I fucking hate
getting dressed up!

01:09:35.063 --> 01:09:37.398
Yeah... um...
me too.

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:41.027
Hey, why don't you cut
open that wine?

01:09:42.278 --> 01:09:44.029
You going to
have some wine?

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:45.907
Hah yes!

01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:47.075
Okay.

01:09:49.993 --> 01:09:52.538
No more okay! Mommy
has company...

01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:53.997
seriously stop!

01:09:54.082 --> 01:09:55.500
But I don't feel good!

01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:57.085
I understand.

01:09:57.168 --> 01:09:59.128
That's why you need
to go to sleep, okay.

01:09:59.212 --> 01:10:01.172
Sleep makes you feel
better.

01:10:03.758 --> 01:10:05.635
Aaah!

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:07.846
Christ, I'm sorry!

01:10:07.929 --> 01:10:09.764
No, it's fine!

01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:12.934
So...

01:10:13.059 --> 01:10:15.228
um...
I was thinking.

01:10:16.855 --> 01:10:18.147
What if...

01:10:19.065 --> 01:10:20.942
What if Aegis just decides
to pretend,

01:10:21.025 --> 01:10:22.986
that the videos we are making
don't exist?

01:10:23.653 --> 01:10:25.113
Usually doesn't work like that.

01:10:26.948 --> 01:10:28.533
It's kinda like
the legal system.

01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:30.827
Innocent until proven guilty.

01:10:31.494 --> 01:10:34.038
I mean, you're injured because
you're claiming to be,

01:10:34.122 --> 01:10:35.665
until proven otherwise.

01:10:35.748 --> 01:10:36.916
Mommy!

01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:39.752
Oh my god...

01:10:39.878 --> 01:10:40.962
No it's fine!

01:10:41.045 --> 01:10:42.088
Excuse me.

01:11:02.775 --> 01:11:04.611
Aaah my god!
Fuuck!

01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:07.405
That took forever!

01:11:07.488 --> 01:11:09.032
That's fine, seriously.

01:11:09.115 --> 01:11:10.283
I'm so sorry.

01:11:10.366 --> 01:11:11.492
Don't worry about it.

01:11:12.285 --> 01:11:13.369
I need more of that!

01:11:16.748 --> 01:11:17.749
Cheers!

01:11:17.832 --> 01:11:18.833
Cheers!

01:11:24.047 --> 01:11:25.882
So you're going to get
a lot of money.

01:11:27.675 --> 01:11:29.260
What are you going
to do with it?

01:11:29.344 --> 01:11:31.596
You going to buy a house?

01:11:31.679 --> 01:11:32.972
Yeah, I don't know...
maybe.

01:11:34.057 --> 01:11:36.518
Yeah, move somewhere
with a yard.

01:11:38.770 --> 01:11:40.230
I was thinking the other day...

01:11:42.607 --> 01:11:44.025
this is a big gamble.

01:11:45.068 --> 01:11:46.486
For me, I mean...

01:11:47.153 --> 01:11:48.196
like what we're doing,

01:11:48.279 --> 01:11:50.532
it's gonna mean I win my case
in all likelihood.

01:11:51.824 --> 01:11:53.493
But it also means that...

01:11:54.702 --> 01:11:57.372
even though you...
would get in trouble.

01:11:59.791 --> 01:12:00.792
You could...

01:12:01.292 --> 01:12:02.335
fuck me.

01:12:02.835 --> 01:12:04.671
Uh! What?

01:12:04.754 --> 01:12:06.881
over... you could fuck me over!
I want to die!

01:12:06.965 --> 01:12:08.174
No it's fine!

01:12:08.258 --> 01:12:09.259
Ssssh! Shut up!

01:12:09.342 --> 01:12:11.594
If you wake up Casey,
I will seriously kill you!

01:12:21.896 --> 01:12:23.439
I'm glad I me you Ray Brey.

01:12:25.358 --> 01:12:26.526
I'm glad I spied on you.

01:12:27.902 --> 01:12:29.821
You know, you could have
really hurt me.

01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:32.156
Doing your job...

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:33.491
getting video of me.

01:12:35.535 --> 01:12:37.620
If there was anyone else
assigned to my case,

01:12:38.496 --> 01:12:39.622
I'd be in trouble.

01:12:39.706 --> 01:12:40.790
But it wasn't.

01:12:43.751 --> 01:12:44.752
No.

01:13:05.607 --> 01:13:06.816
Oh shit!

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:08.067
Hey!

01:13:08.151 --> 01:13:09.194
Shouldn't we... um...

01:13:10.987 --> 01:13:12.447
shouldn't we go to the bedroom?

01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:14.991
No, Casey's in there.
She wanted to sleep in my bed.

01:13:16.326 --> 01:13:17.619
Oh, couch it is then.

01:13:18.828 --> 01:13:20.663
No! No!

01:13:30.173 --> 01:13:31.174
Ray!

01:13:31.758 --> 01:13:33.176
It's been a long time
for me.

01:13:34.302 --> 01:13:35.303
Right.
Um...

01:13:36.554 --> 01:13:37.555
I'm sorry

01:13:37.639 --> 01:13:38.640
It's okay.

01:13:38.723 --> 01:13:39.724
You sure?

01:13:39.807 --> 01:13:40.808
Yeah.

01:13:44.646 --> 01:13:47.482
I don't know for certain,
I mean... ah... I think... ah...

01:13:48.775 --> 01:13:49.776
right...

01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:52.111
I don't know...

01:13:52.403 --> 01:13:53.404
exactly when.

01:13:54.656 --> 01:13:55.698
Soon, I think.

01:13:56.616 --> 01:13:57.867
They... I mean, I could...

01:13:57.951 --> 01:13:59.661
give you guys
a call back next week.

01:14:01.746 --> 01:14:02.747
Okay.

01:14:04.082 --> 01:14:05.083
I got it.

01:14:05.667 --> 01:14:08.211
No, no, I'm
sorry...

01:14:10.088 --> 01:14:12.882
I mean next week I think I'll
be able to cut it all back.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.721
Okay.

01:14:20.515 --> 01:14:21.516
Okay.

01:14:22.892 --> 01:14:24.269
You doing the Morgan report?

01:14:24.769 --> 01:14:25.770
Yip

01:14:27.647 --> 01:14:28.773
What a cluster fuck!

01:14:32.193 --> 01:14:34.237
Hey... those guys
over at Aegis...

01:14:36.906 --> 01:14:38.324
they not pissed off, are they?

01:14:38.408 --> 01:14:39.409
Nah,

01:14:40.368 --> 01:14:43.121
I mean, the bitch is injured
so they going to pay.

01:14:44.289 --> 01:14:46.749
They've already reached out
asking for a settlement,

01:14:46.833 --> 01:14:48.585
way more than they
wanted to pay.

01:14:48.668 --> 01:14:50.295
Probably close to what
she wanted.

01:14:50.378 --> 01:14:52.338
Probably high six figures,
at least

01:14:52.422 --> 01:14:53.423
Oh.

01:14:54.299 --> 01:14:55.466
Good for her.

01:14:56.926 --> 01:14:58.219
Seriously!

01:14:58.720 --> 01:14:59.846
Have you spoken to Joe?

01:15:00.013 --> 01:15:01.014
No?

01:15:01.139 --> 01:15:03.892
When I don't hear from that
self destructive motherfucker,

01:15:03.975 --> 01:15:04.976
I start to worry.

01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:09.606
Gah!
I'm sure he's fine!

01:15:11.733 --> 01:15:12.775
- Yeah
- Yeah.

01:15:35.215 --> 01:15:37.342
You know, I'm really
worried about Joe.

01:15:38.384 --> 01:15:39.886
He doesn't disappear like this.

01:15:42.013 --> 01:15:43.598
Maybe he moved
o the trash island.

01:15:46.017 --> 01:15:49.354
He's got health issues man...
high blood pressure.

01:15:50.563 --> 01:15:52.106
Well, he's self-destructed.

01:15:53.316 --> 01:15:54.567
Yeah, I hope he's alright.

01:15:55.944 --> 01:15:57.153
I'm sure he's fine.

01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:01.908
This chick, she...
hasn't texted me back either.

01:16:04.619 --> 01:16:06.120
The insurance scam chick?

01:16:06.204 --> 01:16:08.331
You haven't told anyone
about that have you?

01:16:08.414 --> 01:16:11.584
Of course not,
I mean... who would I even tell?

01:16:12.085 --> 01:16:13.086
No one.

01:16:13.836 --> 01:16:14.837
I'd be fucked!

01:16:14.921 --> 01:16:19.175
I know! Huh... but you're being
careful like you said.

01:16:19.259 --> 01:16:22.011
And... at this point she's in it
just as much as you are...

01:16:22.095 --> 01:16:23.847
so I'm sure she'd be
just as screwed.

01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:25.348
No dude! She wouldn't be!

01:16:27.392 --> 01:16:28.393
Alright man,

01:16:28.476 --> 01:16:31.312
she's probably just dealing
with the whole settlement thing.

01:16:31.396 --> 01:16:33.022
I mean, it's like...
imminent.

01:16:33.815 --> 01:16:34.816
Now... right?

01:16:34.899 --> 01:16:36.985
Yeah!...
I guess.

01:16:37.777 --> 01:16:40.113
Well, I hope it works out man...
you know like...

01:16:40.196 --> 01:16:42.031
the whole thing
with your mom's fucked.

01:16:43.074 --> 01:16:44.075
Me too.

01:16:47.328 --> 01:16:49.497
Did you sign a contract
or something?

01:16:51.749 --> 01:16:53.626
No, I didn't have her sign
a contract.

01:16:56.629 --> 01:16:58.673
Yeah, I guess you could
not have done that.

01:16:58.756 --> 01:17:00.383
I dunno man... like...

01:17:01.176 --> 01:17:02.260
I'm sure it'll be fine.

01:17:04.762 --> 01:17:05.805
Me too.

01:17:05.889 --> 01:17:06.973
Hey... Uh...

01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:08.892
Morning Sir... I was wondering...

01:17:08.975 --> 01:17:11.227
I was calling... on the
uh... Colleen Morgan case.

01:17:11.311 --> 01:17:12.604
Uh...

01:17:12.687 --> 01:17:14.147
did you get my report?

01:17:14.439 --> 01:17:16.816
I mean I sent it to you guys
a couple of weeks ago

01:17:21.196 --> 01:17:22.864
Yeah, totally, you know,
I mean...

01:17:22.947 --> 01:17:25.241
I wish I could get something
better for you guys,

01:17:25.325 --> 01:17:26.826
something a little more useful.

01:17:29.787 --> 01:17:32.415
Alright so it's over then?
Did she settle?

01:17:35.919 --> 01:17:36.920
Alright.
Wow!

01:17:38.046 --> 01:17:39.130
How much did she get?

01:17:42.592 --> 01:17:44.052
Seriously... hmm.

01:17:57.232 --> 01:17:58.316
Fuck me!

01:18:10.954 --> 01:18:11.955
Colleen!

01:18:12.163 --> 01:18:13.414
Hey man!

01:18:13.498 --> 01:18:14.582
She moved.

01:18:15.792 --> 01:18:16.793
What?

01:18:16.876 --> 01:18:18.711
The moving truck was
here this weekend.

01:18:19.337 --> 01:18:20.588
But no! I... uh...

01:18:22.549 --> 01:18:24.509
Do you, do you,
know where she was going?

01:18:24.592 --> 01:18:26.261
No... she didn't say.

01:18:26.427 --> 01:18:28.596
She was here with her husband,
they loaded up...

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:30.098
- Wait... her husband!
- Hmm...

01:18:32.642 --> 01:18:34.310
I thought it was her husband,
but...

01:18:34.394 --> 01:18:35.854
Maybe it was her brother.

01:18:36.521 --> 01:18:37.522
Thanks.

01:18:56.207 --> 01:18:57.208
Ray.

01:18:59.419 --> 01:19:00.420
Hey Pat

01:19:02.005 --> 01:19:03.214
You hear about Joe?

01:19:04.632 --> 01:19:05.633
What?

01:19:07.177 --> 01:19:08.178
No.

01:19:08.636 --> 01:19:10.388
I mean, I've been trying to
reach him,

01:19:10.471 --> 01:19:13.266
but he hasn't been answering.
Is he okay?

01:19:13.349 --> 01:19:15.101
I told him!
I fucking told him...

01:19:15.185 --> 01:19:17.770
that he's gotta
start taking care of himself,

01:19:17.854 --> 01:19:19.689
or something like this
is gonna happen.

01:19:21.774 --> 01:19:22.859
What happened?

01:19:40.752 --> 01:19:41.920
Fuck off!

01:19:51.429 --> 01:19:52.639
What do you want?

01:19:54.015 --> 01:19:56.184
Jesus Christ, Joe!

01:19:58.561 --> 01:20:00.688
A fucking heart attack man!
What the fuck!

01:20:01.814 --> 01:20:04.025
These doctors are a bunch
of ass holes!

01:20:04.692 --> 01:20:05.777
They keep hounding me,

01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:07.862
about what I should have
done differently.

01:20:07.946 --> 01:20:10.073
There's a lot I should
have done differently!

01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:11.533
I know that!

01:20:13.076 --> 01:20:14.285
But here I am!

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.957
Well... I'm really sorry Joe...

01:20:22.544 --> 01:20:24.796
You know I believe in God?

01:20:26.381 --> 01:20:27.590
I didn't always.

01:20:29.551 --> 01:20:32.387
Always seemed like an idea
that was so improbable...

01:20:36.182 --> 01:20:37.725
then something happened.

01:20:37.809 --> 01:20:39.269
What happened?

01:20:40.061 --> 01:20:41.354
Well...

01:20:42.522 --> 01:20:45.233
a case I had a couple
of years back...

01:20:45.316 --> 01:20:46.651
guy named Crespo...

01:20:49.571 --> 01:20:51.531
I got dragged to this party...

01:20:51.739 --> 01:20:55.535
By a... guy I knew.

01:20:55.618 --> 01:20:56.828
We were working on this,

01:20:56.911 --> 01:20:59.455
business venture we
were trying to get started.

01:20:59.539 --> 01:21:02.083
So... we go to this party,
we meet...

01:21:02.208 --> 01:21:05.086
this rich guy... Crespo.

01:21:06.462 --> 01:21:08.756
And I'm telling him about
our idea...

01:21:10.091 --> 01:21:12.302
And he gets really interested,
and says...

01:21:12.385 --> 01:21:14.095
Yeah, well it's
an interesting idea.

01:21:14.179 --> 01:21:16.222
I'd love to hear more about it.

01:21:16.306 --> 01:21:18.558
So we exchanged
business cards, and um...

01:21:18.933 --> 01:21:20.476
the next week...

01:21:21.102 --> 01:21:22.478
we went out for lunch and...

01:21:23.438 --> 01:21:25.273
he really seemed interested.

01:21:25.607 --> 01:21:26.691
One day...

01:21:26.774 --> 01:21:28.860
I'm on a call, with Olivier...

01:21:28.943 --> 01:21:30.445
heading into the office.

01:21:30.528 --> 01:21:33.364
He loved our business plan,
he's jacked up about it.

01:21:33.448 --> 01:21:35.617
We thought he was really ready
to cut a cheque.

01:21:37.285 --> 01:21:38.453
So I go into my office...

01:21:39.704 --> 01:21:40.705
walk to my desk...

01:21:40.788 --> 01:21:42.498
while I'm talking to him,

01:21:42.582 --> 01:21:44.667
and I looked down,

01:21:45.126 --> 01:21:46.211
on my desk,

01:21:47.045 --> 01:21:48.504
there is this new case file...

01:21:49.255 --> 01:21:52.967
and it says Olivier... Crespo!

01:21:53.051 --> 01:21:54.677
Nah! You got to be kidding me!

01:21:56.012 --> 01:21:57.013
No.

01:21:57.597 --> 01:21:59.599
So there were two guys
with the same name?

01:22:00.642 --> 01:22:01.643
No.

01:22:02.393 --> 01:22:05.730
It was the same guy.
He was a coiner.

01:22:05.813 --> 01:22:08.525
There was some telemarketing
firm he worked for.

01:22:11.069 --> 01:22:14.656
All his rich guy shit
was all bullshit!

01:22:15.865 --> 01:22:17.158
But that's not the point.

01:22:18.743 --> 01:22:19.744
The point is...

01:22:19.827 --> 01:22:21.663
I was talking to him
on the phone...

01:22:23.122 --> 01:22:24.624
and there on my desk...

01:22:25.667 --> 01:22:27.544
is a case file
with his name on it!

01:22:28.169 --> 01:22:30.380
Fuck!
What did you do?

01:22:31.714 --> 01:22:34.467
I just... I was in such shock
I just hung up.

01:22:35.426 --> 01:22:37.387
That's almost too incredible
to be true.

01:22:43.351 --> 01:22:44.853
Joe...

01:22:44.936 --> 01:22:46.771
if there's anything
you want me to do...

01:22:47.647 --> 01:22:49.232
What do?

01:22:51.484 --> 01:22:54.112
My dogs. I'm worried
about my dogs.

01:22:57.615 --> 01:22:59.409
Maybe you could check on them?

01:22:59.492 --> 01:23:00.952
Yeah. Absolutely.

01:23:01.035 --> 01:23:03.288
I... I... I talked to my
neighbor, the nigger...

01:23:03.413 --> 01:23:06.332
he'll watch them, they'll be
okay until I get home.

01:23:06.416 --> 01:23:08.084
I don't know when I'll get back.

01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:12.171
I don't know.

01:24:11.981 --> 01:24:13.483
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

01:24:33.753 --> 01:24:34.754
Husband?

01:24:35.672 --> 01:24:37.090
I'm sorry, Ray.

01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:38.591
Thought he was gone?

01:24:41.052 --> 01:24:42.053
He was.

01:24:42.345 --> 01:24:44.722
We were separated,
but not divorced.

01:24:44.806 --> 01:24:46.182
Did he come back before or...

01:24:46.808 --> 01:24:48.101
or after the settlement?

01:24:49.102 --> 01:24:51.229
Well that... the case
is still ongoing

01:24:51.312 --> 01:24:52.438
No it's not!

01:24:55.191 --> 01:24:56.568
Jesus Christ!

01:24:57.402 --> 01:24:59.112
Fuck! I should have listened
to Joe!

01:24:59.195 --> 01:25:00.196
What?

01:25:00.572 --> 01:25:01.990
Goddammit!

01:25:02.073 --> 01:25:04.325
You didn't tell someone what
happened, did you?

01:25:05.243 --> 01:25:07.328
You didn't tell
anyone what we did?

01:25:07.412 --> 01:25:09.122
You couldn't be
that fucking stupid!

01:25:09.205 --> 01:25:11.082
Relax. Joe's not going
to say anything.

01:25:11.165 --> 01:25:12.750
Yeah, well he fucking
better not!

01:25:13.585 --> 01:25:15.086
If anyone finds out...

01:25:16.462 --> 01:25:17.505
anyone.

01:25:18.756 --> 01:25:20.675
I'm going to say
you forced me to do it.

01:25:20.758 --> 01:25:22.594
I'm going to say,
it was all your idea.

01:25:23.178 --> 01:25:25.013
Well... it was my idea.

01:25:27.974 --> 01:25:29.809
And I'm going to say
that you raped me.

01:25:37.734 --> 01:25:39.027
Wow!

01:25:43.031 --> 01:25:44.490
So my ten percent...

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:47.076
you not going
to pay me shit are you?

01:25:59.422 --> 01:26:00.506
Huh!

01:26:02.008 --> 01:26:03.593
Yeah, I really needed
that money.

01:26:06.179 --> 01:26:08.431
I don't know what I'm going
to do about my mom!

01:26:13.645 --> 01:26:15.647
I have my own family... Ray

01:26:18.942 --> 01:26:20.235
I'm sorry.

01:26:25.615 --> 01:26:27.575
If you say anything
to anyone.

01:26:30.245 --> 01:26:31.829
I will seriously ruin your life.

01:26:35.333 --> 01:26:36.584
Oh, what can you do?

01:26:39.671 --> 01:26:40.713
Let it go.

01:27:28.210 --> 01:27:33.210
