00:08.275 --> 00:10.009
What's happening, man?

00:10.011 --> 00:11.010
I can't see you.

00:11.012 --> 00:12.144
I'm working on it.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.348
Don't play with me, man.
JUSTIN: Look, what do you want?

00:16.350 --> 00:19.785
I am going as fast as I can,
so let me do this!

00:22.523 --> 00:24.590
(whimpering)

00:27.495 --> 00:29.161
(whimpering)

00:33.134 --> 00:34.633
(woman cries out)

00:38.773 --> 00:41.040
(birds singing)

00:44.779 --> 00:47.079
You tickle me,
I will leave you.

00:47.081 --> 00:49.348
(laughs)

00:49.350 --> 00:51.383
What makes you think
I'd do something like that?

00:51.385 --> 00:53.786
Hey, listen.

00:53.788 --> 00:55.487
I have a idea.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.389
How about we switch, okay?

00:57.391 --> 00:59.525
I want three naps,

00:59.527 --> 01:03.128
nine hot meals,
bubble baths and back massages

01:03.130 --> 01:06.432
every day while you go out
and slave on double shifts.

01:06.434 --> 01:09.068
Hey, I'm working
my butt off here.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.069
Yeah?

01:10.071 --> 01:12.438
How you feeling?

01:12.440 --> 01:14.106
Like a punching bag.

01:14.108 --> 01:15.340
(both laugh)

01:15.342 --> 01:16.809
Feel that?

01:16.811 --> 01:18.644
(laughing):
Yes.
(laughs)

01:20.381 --> 01:22.448
Mmm.

01:22.450 --> 01:25.551
Listen, I have a surprise
for you.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.486
Uh-huh.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.388
¶ Ta-dum! ¶
Oh.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.156
Gee. My cell phone.
Yes, except

01:31.158 --> 01:34.793
now it has a direct link
to this one,

01:34.795 --> 01:36.628
which I'm gonna put
in the nursery.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.564
(clicks tongue)
Free baby monitor.

01:38.566 --> 01:39.731
Is that legal?
Yeah...

01:39.733 --> 01:41.133
Yeah. I just...

01:41.135 --> 01:43.735
I-I gave the phone a dynamic IP,
right?

01:43.737 --> 01:45.104
And then I set up
our home system

01:45.106 --> 01:46.305
to work as a remote c...

01:46.307 --> 01:47.773
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, you don't care, okay.

01:49.743 --> 01:52.277
Thank you.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.847
Have I ever told you
how much I love you?

01:54.849 --> 01:58.750
No, I don't think so.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.586
Well, you're gonna have
to remind me

02:00.588 --> 02:02.521
to get around to that someday.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.590
(phone ringing)

02:07.528 --> 02:09.528
Who is it?

02:09.530 --> 02:10.629
Mike.

02:15.202 --> 02:16.568
Hey, Mike.
What's going on?

02:16.570 --> 02:18.203
MIKE:
Jus, I need to talk to you.
It's serious.

02:18.205 --> 02:19.805
It's actually a really bad time
right now, Mike.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.573
I'm headed to work.
I've got an afternoon shift.

02:21.575 --> 02:22.741
Please, man.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.176
I'm serious, Mike.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.511
I'm getting into my car
right now.

02:25.513 --> 02:26.745
No, you're not.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.254
Hang on.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.622
Justin...

02:36.624 --> 02:38.690
I know.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.529
What am I gonna do?

02:43.531 --> 02:44.830
It's Mike.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.734
I'll see you tonight.

02:55.242 --> 02:57.309
(chatter and laughter)

02:58.345 --> 02:59.545
Ladies!
DONNA:
Hey!

02:59.547 --> 03:00.746
Look at that.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.214
How was your weekend?
It was great,

03:02.216 --> 03:03.482
but I missed your smiling faces.

03:03.484 --> 03:04.650
Oh.

03:04.652 --> 03:05.884
Two milks?
Yes, thank you.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.252
Winnie, black?

03:07.254 --> 03:08.353
Thank you.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.355
All right,
Sam, Ice-Cap.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.324
Nice tan.
Cheers, boss.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.559
How was your soul-searching?

03:13.561 --> 03:15.494
Good, thanks.
Oh, yeah?
You find one?

03:15.496 --> 03:16.662
Lou?
Thank you.

03:16.664 --> 03:17.930
All right. Ed? Wordy?

03:17.932 --> 03:19.498
In the lockers,
I think.
Oh.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.200
JULES:
Hey, where's my
double double?

03:21.202 --> 03:22.701
PARKER:
Oh, wow. Look who's
dropped in.

03:22.703 --> 03:23.869
Hey.
Hi.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.237
How are you?

03:25.239 --> 03:27.239
How are you?
Hi.

03:27.241 --> 03:28.740
Hey.
PARKER:
Donna, Jules, Jules, Donna.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.342
Hi, Donna.
Hi. How are you?

03:30.344 --> 03:32.211
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

03:32.213 --> 03:33.645
How you feeling?
100%.
How about you?

03:33.647 --> 03:34.746
150.
Oh, come on.

03:34.748 --> 03:35.847
Come on, let's walk.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.216
(Jules laughs)

03:37.218 --> 03:38.383
Ooh, make a muscle.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.518
Oh, that's
nice!
Mm-hmm.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.286
I'll take these
to Ed and Wordy.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.355
Uh, no. It's okay.
I'll do it.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.993
$20,000?!
I can put
something together.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.795
I can sell some stuff.
It wouldn't be an issue.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.797
Mike, there's no way.
I don't have that kind of money.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.765
I know, I know, I know.
I just figured, you know,

03:53.767 --> 03:55.734
you work at the bank, maybe
you could transfer some money.

03:55.736 --> 03:56.902
Maybe I could what, Mike?

03:56.904 --> 03:58.337
What do you
think I could do?

03:58.339 --> 03:59.538
I'm a button pusher.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.974
I don't authorize loans
to gambling addicts.

04:01.976 --> 04:04.276
Yeah, well, then maybe
you can push the right buttons.

04:04.278 --> 04:05.244
Oh, I don't
believe this.

04:05.246 --> 04:06.411
It's temporary, Jus.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.981
It's gonna take
a couple of days.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.991
You know, we don't hear
from you in six months,

04:18.993 --> 04:20.492
and we think, you
know, thank God,

04:20.494 --> 04:21.760
he's finally got
his act together.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.862
I know. I know. I know.
I wouldn't be coming

04:23.864 --> 04:25.931
to you unless
I was desperate, okay?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.303
Who are these guys, Mike?

04:31.305 --> 04:32.771
I don't know.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.773
I don't know.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.908
They just showed up.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.477
I've never seen them before.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.946
All of a sudden,
the ten grand that I owe

04:40.948 --> 04:42.948
is now 20.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.950
(sighs)

04:44.952 --> 04:48.053
And I'm scared, man.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.322
Justin, I'm scared.

04:52.559 --> 04:53.725
I can't do this.

04:53.727 --> 04:54.960
It's numbers, man.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.795
This is too much.
It's just
numbers, man.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.030
It's not legal.
You're all
that I have.

04:58.032 --> 04:59.598
You don't do this...
Mike, come on.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.768
If you do not do this,
and then this time tomorrow,

05:02.770 --> 05:04.836
they're gonna take me out.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.407
Is that what you want?

05:08.409 --> 05:10.509
Is that what you want?!

05:12.446 --> 05:15.714
Justin, these guys...

05:15.716 --> 05:17.783
These guys are crazy, man.

05:17.784 --> 05:19.851
You still have that Bravelink
account I set up for you, right?

05:25.326 --> 05:27.326
Write down your account number
and PIN.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.928
I can get into the system
and make a deposit.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.496
I'll bypass the ATM
withdrawal limit.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.498
I knew you'd think
of something, man.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.734
Mike, this is not
free money, okay?

05:35.736 --> 05:38.503
Anything you take out,
you have to put back.

05:42.343 --> 05:44.409
Trust me, okay?

05:49.750 --> 05:52.017
Mike?

05:53.587 --> 05:55.887
This is the last time.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.093
Okay, go. I'll call
you when it's done.

06:01.095 --> 06:02.561
(engine starting)

06:38.031 --> 06:40.599
(computer beeps and trills)

06:42.936 --> 06:44.736
Ginger.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.572
That should help.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.574
Maya.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.443
With the morning sickness.
There's ginger

06:51.445 --> 06:52.544
tea and a
peppermint rub.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.812
Thanks, Brenda.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.047
I'm sure she'll appreciate it.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.983
You okay, kiddo?

06:57.985 --> 06:59.918
'Cause this stuff'll
help you, too,

06:59.920 --> 07:02.521
if you're freaked out
about the little one.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.455
No, no. I'm good, thanks.

07:03.457 --> 07:06.158
Bren, I'm-I'm...

07:06.160 --> 07:08.693
Really, thank you very much.

07:08.695 --> 07:11.530
Oh.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.199
Well, you're in luck, 'cause
the rates are really attractive.

07:23.177 --> 07:25.811
(computer beeps and trills)

07:25.813 --> 07:28.880
(typing)

07:31.552 --> 07:34.486
(sighs)

07:34.488 --> 07:37.789
(phone ringing through)

07:37.791 --> 07:40.525
It's in your account.

07:44.531 --> 07:47.699
You up for a high school
career show-and-tell?

07:47.701 --> 07:49.000
Yeah.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.836
I'm thinking about
sending Jules with you.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.537
What, you think
she's ready?

07:52.539 --> 07:54.539
Well, she passed
her re-qualifying tests

07:54.541 --> 07:55.640
with a perfect score.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.742
So her and Sam
on the same team?

07:57.744 --> 07:59.511
Talked to both of them,
thing's over.

07:59.513 --> 08:00.779
It's not that simple.

08:00.781 --> 08:01.947
They're professionals.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.949
What about Donna?

08:03.951 --> 08:05.817
A team is seven.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.886
I got to make a choice.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.463
DARRYL:
Justin?

08:18.464 --> 08:20.664
Some guy out at Customer Service
says he really needs to see you.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.102
(sniffles)

08:36.817 --> 08:39.017
(whispering): What the hell
are you doing here, Mike?

08:39.019 --> 08:40.619
Jus, there's a
change of plan.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.287
What?
They want more.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.589
$500,000 into
this account.

08:44.591 --> 08:46.691
Oh, are you crazy, Mike?

08:46.693 --> 08:47.959
I can't do that.

08:47.961 --> 08:50.195
Jus, don't panic
and stay calm.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.630
Okay?

08:51.632 --> 08:53.698
I was just sent this.

08:54.668 --> 08:57.636
Justin, please.

08:57.638 --> 09:00.805
They want their money by 6:00.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.707
But they say they'll...

09:02.709 --> 09:05.176
they'll kill me
if you don't do it.

09:05.178 --> 09:08.280
One hour, then she dies.

09:08.282 --> 09:10.582
Oh, my God.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.818
Maya. How?

09:12.819 --> 09:15.053
They must have followed
me to your place, okay?

09:15.055 --> 09:16.655
Jus,

09:16.657 --> 09:17.589
I'm sorry.

09:17.591 --> 09:18.256
I'm so sorry.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.624
We have to call the cops.

09:19.626 --> 09:20.792
You do that...

09:20.794 --> 09:23.828
You do that,
and they'll kill her.

09:23.830 --> 09:27.632
You just need to send the money,
and they're gonna let her go.

09:27.634 --> 09:28.967
It's not that easy!

09:28.969 --> 09:30.635
You already did it once, right?

09:30.637 --> 09:32.737
So you can do it again.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.874
It's too late.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.609
They tripped the alarm.

09:37.611 --> 09:39.744
They tripped the alarm.
Cops are on the way.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.647
Okay, look, we have to keep them
from coming in.

09:42.649 --> 09:45.250
You need to keep them
out until you're done.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.618
That's the only
choice we have.

09:46.619 --> 09:47.985
That's the only choice
we have. Everyone down!

09:47.988 --> 09:49.621
Everybody down on the
ground. Do it now.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.289
Lock the door! Do it now!

09:51.291 --> 09:53.725
MAN:
He's got a gun.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.961
Close the blinds!

09:55.963 --> 09:59.164
You! You are gonna listen to me,

09:59.166 --> 10:00.899
and you are gonna do
everything that I say!

  CBS

10:35.802 --> 10:37.335
WINNIE:
Team One. Hot call.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.337
Bravelink Financial,
King and Cooper.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.806
Single armed gunman,
multiple hostages.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.908
(sirens blaring)

10:45.178 --> 10:47.178
First responder?

10:47.180 --> 10:49.347
Just over there, sir.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.282
How many hostages?

10:51.284 --> 10:52.884
Don't know.
A dozen or so.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.886
He closed the blinds,
so we can't see in.
Okay.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.955
Upstairs empty?
We cleared the
building just in case.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.724
Access is through a
fire door in the alley.

10:59.726 --> 11:02.293
Okay, thanks.
Keep it contained.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.863
(garbled radio transmission)

11:05.832 --> 11:07.515
PARKER:
How's it look, Eddie?

11:07.516 --> 11:09.199
No Sierra shot.
The front door is too exposed.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.869
We're going to go in
through the back.

11:10.871 --> 11:13.371
It's a strange place to hit,
Internet bank. No cash.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.707
Yeah, this guy's an amateur.
Hasn't done his homework.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.910
Or he never expected
to carry anything out
with him.
Right.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.012
Lewis, I need
the building plans.
Copy that.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.947
Okay, Spike,
let's get eyes inside.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.883
See what's going on
behind those curtains.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.084
SPIKE:
Copy that.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.963
What the hell are you
doing with a gun, Mike?

11:38.965 --> 11:40.999
I borrowed it,
friend of a friend.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.435
Told you they were serious.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.270
Mike, who are
these people?

11:46.239 --> 11:48.139
(hushed):
Look...

11:49.076 --> 11:50.942
Look, we're on camera.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.812
You look like a hostage, okay?

11:53.814 --> 11:55.780
You let me take
the blame for this.

11:55.782 --> 11:57.115
It'll probably
work out okay.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.017
This is crazy.

11:59.018 --> 12:00.918
When you have hostages,
when you have hostages,

12:00.921 --> 12:03.455
they give you
some space. Okay?

12:03.457 --> 12:05.857
You have time
to do your thing.

12:05.859 --> 12:08.960
Two minutes, we're done.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.229
Maya's safe. Come on.
No, no, no, no, no, listen.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.364
We talk to the cops...
"We talk to the cops"?

12:13.366 --> 12:15.400
Tell them what?

12:15.402 --> 12:17.969
I don't know
who these guys are.

12:17.971 --> 12:21.039
And I don't know
where they took her.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.307
Now, you heard
what they said.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.042
If they don't get
the money by 6:00,

12:24.044 --> 12:26.845
Maya dies.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.180
(phone rings)

12:32.819 --> 12:34.085
Pick it up!

12:41.194 --> 12:42.994
Hey, this is
Sergeant Gregory Parker.

12:42.996 --> 12:45.396
I'm with the Police Strategic
Response Unit.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.065
Who am I speaking to?

12:47.067 --> 12:50.902
This is, um...

12:50.904 --> 12:52.537
This is Mike McKewon.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.073
And I'm in this alone.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.842
First contact
with subject, 5:17 p.m.

12:57.844 --> 12:59.344
A bank robber
who gives up his name?

12:59.346 --> 13:00.812
Run it.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.547
And see if he's
got a cell phone.

13:02.549 --> 13:05.283
Well, Mike, just
want you to know that
I'm here to help you.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.851
But first,
I need to know

13:06.853 --> 13:08.953
that everyone in there's okay.
Everyone's fine.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.855
And they'll stay that way as
long as you keep your distance.

13:10.857 --> 13:13.391
Okay, Mike, but first...
Yeah, you just stay out.

13:13.393 --> 13:16.427
You stay out
and nobody gets hurts.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.397
All right, Mike, just stay
on the phone with me...

13:19.399 --> 13:21.132
(line disconnects)

13:23.036 --> 13:24.869
Hey, Eddie, you hear that?

13:24.871 --> 13:27.806
Yeah, he wants time.
Yeah, but for what?

13:27.808 --> 13:30.108
What do you got, buddy?

13:30.110 --> 13:32.210
We're going to go in
through the back.

13:32.211 --> 13:34.311
Sam and Wordy are going
to enter the fire exit
and extract the hostages.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.481
Donna and I are going to go down
the central staircase.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.816
Okay, that sounds good.

13:37.818 --> 13:40.185
Spike, we need eyes in.
Come on.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.086
Security system's
got extra firewalls.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.155
It's hard to get access
from outside the building.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.157
Downloading the codes now,
eyes in five.

13:52.365 --> 13:53.932
What? Wh-What's wrong?

13:53.934 --> 13:56.034
The system's locked me out.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.902
Uh, bypass it.
I've tried. I've tried.

13:57.904 --> 14:00.104
It's completely shut down.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.412
Mr. Aguinaldo,
you got to help me.

14:07.414 --> 14:08.546
Please.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.148
Look, don't make me
hurt your friend.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.566
I can't help you.

14:11.567 --> 14:12.983
Network shuts down
when the alarm goes off.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.552
Security protocol
in case this happens.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.020
No transfers in or out.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.956
Okay, well, what about
the, the override codes

14:17.958 --> 14:20.992
to reboot the system?
I don't have those.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.560
Then who does?! Huh?

14:23.530 --> 14:24.929
You?!

14:24.931 --> 14:27.232
You got them?!

14:27.234 --> 14:30.101
How about you?!

14:31.071 --> 14:32.571
What about you?

14:32.572 --> 14:34.072
Take it easy, all right?
They don't have them.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.975
T-Tenth floor.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.277
Only the execs have the codes
on the tenth floor.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.346
(cell phone rings)

14:44.150 --> 14:45.650
Yeah?

14:45.652 --> 14:47.118
Looks like you're done.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.553
No, everything's under control.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.288
We just had
a little setback.

14:50.290 --> 14:53.124
I see the setback.
It's all over my TV.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.659
It's over.

14:54.661 --> 14:57.161
We're going to cut our losses.
(Maya crying)

14:57.163 --> 14:59.330
What do you mean, "It's over"?
It's not...
No! No!

14:59.332 --> 15:01.099
No-no-no, no! Please!

15:01.101 --> 15:02.133
Please! Listen!

15:02.135 --> 15:03.301
You'll get your money, okay?

15:03.303 --> 15:05.103
You said 6:00.
That was before

15:05.105 --> 15:07.238
you had cops all over your ass.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.240
I will get it to you!
I just need some time.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.242
Time to talk to the cops.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.944
(Maya sobbing)
No. No-no-no, I won't.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.247
I can prove it to you. Okay?

15:16.249 --> 15:18.449
Um, do you have a computer?
Yeah.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.184
Okay, I'm going to send you
a Web address.

15:20.186 --> 15:21.519
Okay, please,
give me two minutes.

15:21.521 --> 15:22.987
You can watch
everything from there.

15:22.989 --> 15:25.089
I'll call you right back.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.331
Hey! What's going on?

15:33.333 --> 15:34.565
I got to buy
some trust.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.067
I'll be back.

15:40.674 --> 15:42.340
Nobody move.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.242
PARKER:
<i> Mike McKewon. He's our guy.</i>

15:44.244 --> 15:46.144
He's got a record.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.245
(typing)

15:47.247 --> 15:49.280
Mostly petty stuff.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.083
Nothing violent: B&Es,
possession with intent to sell,

15:52.085 --> 15:54.452
credit card fraud.
Guy's all over the map.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.720
One thing in
common, though:

15:55.722 --> 15:57.288
fast cash.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.723
So you think we're dealing
with an addict?

15:58.725 --> 16:01.142
Well, scores every few months.

16:01.143 --> 16:03.560
He's feeding some kind of habit
or he's paying off some loans.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.296
Spike, come on.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.066
Show starts in three, two...

16:09.302 --> 16:11.502
PARKER:
What's he doing?

16:11.504 --> 16:14.072
You seeing this Eddie?

16:14.074 --> 16:15.540
Yeah.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.408
Looks like our guy's
letting his guard down.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.043
Or waiting for something.

16:19.045 --> 16:20.311
Won't be waiting long.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.380
We're going in.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.395
Yes!

16:40.500 --> 16:42.367
You got it?

16:42.369 --> 16:44.202
Yeah, I got it.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.304
Okay, I've tapped you
into the CCTV

16:46.306 --> 16:48.006
so you can see everything now.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.208
We start talking to the cops,
you will know it.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.510
Okay.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.713
(Maya whimpering)

17:08.261 --> 17:09.794
So I'll watch it

17:09.796 --> 17:12.230
with your girl here.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.632
You make sure
you keep your promise.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.338
Hey, you got a problem.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.043
JUSTIN:
Damn it. Okay, okay...

17:25.045 --> 17:26.811
Okay, okay...

17:26.813 --> 17:29.247
I'll take care of it, all right?
Just don't hurt her, please?

17:43.596 --> 17:46.130
Hostages are in range.

17:46.132 --> 17:47.765
Preparing distraction.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.501
PARKER:
On your go, Eddie.

17:52.705 --> 17:55.640
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

17:55.642 --> 17:57.175
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Don't come any closer!

17:57.177 --> 17:58.309
ED:
Okay, Mike?

17:58.311 --> 18:00.745
Let's just take this slow.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.450
I said don't come any closer

18:05.452 --> 18:06.684
or I shoot him!
Please!

18:06.686 --> 18:08.519
JUSTIN:
He'll do it!

18:10.857 --> 18:12.790
Jus, they've got our hostages.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.259
You've got me,
so just... keep cool.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.778
Yeah.

18:16.779 --> 18:18.296
Calmly and quickly leave
the building.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.397
Keep your heads down.

18:21.401 --> 18:22.800
There's no way out, Jus.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.402
(sighs)

18:24.404 --> 18:26.170
I'm going to jail.
They got guys on the inside.

18:26.172 --> 18:27.505
I'm dead, man.
This is not about you.

18:27.507 --> 18:28.506
This is about Maya.

18:28.508 --> 18:29.540
There's no way out.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.842
We need police protection.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.343
We've got to talk.
Maya...

18:32.345 --> 18:33.578
They're watching.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.246
ED:
Okay, Mike,
we all want this

18:35.248 --> 18:37.315
to end peacefully,
so just put down the gun.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.450
All right, just put it down,
and we can all...

18:39.452 --> 18:41.185
We can all
walk out of here.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.821
It's not looking good for you.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.791
Hector?

18:46.793 --> 18:49.594
It's time to send a message.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.832
(whimpering)

19:01.441 --> 19:03.341
(muffled protests)

19:16.356 --> 19:17.488
(dialing)

19:17.490 --> 19:19.524
(line ringing)

19:19.526 --> 19:21.359
Be cool, Jus.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.393
Jus...

19:22.395 --> 19:24.262
Mike...

19:24.264 --> 19:26.464
They're watching.
There's no way out.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.399
Jus, we're done.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.401
We're done. We're done.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.437
(cell phone rings)

19:35.375 --> 19:36.941
Don't worry, buddy.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.709
MAYA (on phone):
Justin...

19:38.711 --> 19:41.579
Please! Don't let Mike give up!

19:41.581 --> 19:43.648
They say they'll hurt me
and the baby.

19:43.650 --> 19:46.450
(piercing scream)

19:47.387 --> 19:48.519
It's not over!

19:48.521 --> 19:50.588
Justin...

19:50.590 --> 19:52.323
ED:
Hostage has the weapon.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.391
Repeat, hostage has the weapon.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.759
Damn it.
JUSTIN:
Back off!

19:54.761 --> 19:56.427
And don't interfere!

19:56.429 --> 19:57.695
No solution.

19:57.697 --> 19:58.863
This is not over!

19:58.865 --> 20:01.566
Obstruction. No solution.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.301
Talk to me, boss.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.602
Team One, stand down.

20:04.604 --> 20:06.470
Fall back. Fall back.

20:06.472 --> 20:07.505
Copy that.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.244
ED:
What's going on?

20:13.246 --> 20:14.779
You know something we don't?

20:14.781 --> 20:16.347
Yeah, they're not the threat,
Eddie.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.716
We've just intercepted
that cell phone call.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.218
Go ahead, Lou.
(computer beeps)

20:20.220 --> 20:22.353
MAYA (sobbing on recording):
Justin, please.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.722
Don't let Mike give up!

20:24.724 --> 20:27.325
They say they'll hurt me
and the baby.

20:27.327 --> 20:29.393
(piercing scream)

20:30.330 --> 20:33.698
(Maya screaming and crying)

20:43.243 --> 20:44.508
Man, that was crazy.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.877
You son of a bitch!

20:46.879 --> 20:49.313
You were going to give up!
What are you talking about?

20:49.315 --> 20:50.881
You got us into this and you
were just going to bail?!

20:50.883 --> 20:53.384
Jus...
They're going to kill

20:53.386 --> 20:54.518
Maya and the baby.

20:54.520 --> 20:55.653
What do you mean "baby"?

20:55.655 --> 20:57.722
What baby?! What baby?

20:57.724 --> 20:59.724
Maya's pregnant?

21:02.495 --> 21:03.961
How could you
do this to me, Mike?

21:03.963 --> 21:06.264
Jus, I...
How could you
possibly do this to me?!

21:06.266 --> 21:07.965
I didn't know, Jus.
I'm sorry, okay?

21:07.967 --> 21:08.966
Justin, I'm sorry!

21:08.968 --> 21:10.635
You're always sorry!

21:10.637 --> 21:13.437
And you always call<i> me </i>
to bail you out!

21:13.439 --> 21:15.506
Yeah, I do.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.810
I make mistakes, okay?

21:19.812 --> 21:22.680
I know I do.

21:22.682 --> 21:23.814
I make lots of mistakes!

21:23.816 --> 21:25.983
I know!

21:25.985 --> 21:28.052
I'm sorry I didn't have
the luck to be born

21:28.054 --> 21:30.321
like you with the luck
that you have!

21:31.758 --> 21:33.491
What else do you want me to say?

21:34.994 --> 21:38.729
The next time you screw up,
call someone else.

21:40.066 --> 21:42.667
There is no one else.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.837
You know that.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.513
Let's, uh...

21:55.515 --> 21:57.381
Let's just get the codes
and do this.

21:58.918 --> 22:02.486
So anything you can come up
with would be really helpful.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.789
Did they seem to be familiar
with one another?

22:04.791 --> 22:07.958
5:33 p.m. 12 hostages secured.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.493
To subjects still armed
and active.

22:09.495 --> 22:10.995
A Mike McKewon and an employee

22:10.997 --> 22:13.431
identified by his manager--
Justin Fraser.

22:19.405 --> 22:21.906
WOMAN (sobbing):
Justin, please...

22:21.908 --> 22:23.341
Don't let Mike give up!

22:23.343 --> 22:25.376
This is a video link
they just sent Justin.

22:25.378 --> 22:27.712
They said they'd hurt me
and the baby.

22:27.714 --> 22:30.848
(screaming)

22:30.850 --> 22:31.982
(taps computer key)

22:31.984 --> 22:34.418
Okay, new deal, Ed.

22:34.420 --> 22:36.587
These guys are acting
under duress.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.589
Someone's holding
the employee's wife.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.591
Colleagues say she's
seven months pregnant.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.993
It also sounds like they seem
to know each other, boss.

22:42.995 --> 22:44.995
If they know each other,
what's their connection?

22:44.997 --> 22:46.797
Lewis, did you track the source?

22:46.799 --> 22:48.699
Yeah, prepaid cell, no GPS.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.835
SAM:
Manager said they were trying
to wire money

22:50.837 --> 22:52.837
into an offshore account,
but they didn't have
the right codes.

22:52.839 --> 22:54.505
They still think
they can do it.

22:54.507 --> 22:55.840
And that's why
they won't give up.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.141
If someone had Sophie,
would you?

22:57.143 --> 23:00.711
Winnie, Mike McKewon
and Justin Fraser.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.380
We need a connection.

23:02.382 --> 23:05.416
See who could be pulling their
strings and from where ASAP.

23:05.418 --> 23:06.751
Copy.

23:06.753 --> 23:09.687
Boss, whoever it is,
I think they're watching.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.589
That's what Justin was doing.
He uplinked the security system

23:11.591 --> 23:13.891
to an FTP. If you give
someone the Web address

23:13.893 --> 23:15.760
they can see what we see.

23:15.762 --> 23:17.628
The guy's pretty good.

23:17.630 --> 23:20.131
Want me to interrupt the feed,
block the bad guy's view?

23:20.133 --> 23:22.800
Negative. Ed, this is why Justin
told us not to interfere.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.802
The kidnapper will keep
the wife alive

23:24.804 --> 23:27.071
as long as he thinks
he'll still get his money.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.940
I want to believe
the wife's still alive.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.876
And we can use this
to our advantage.

23:31.878 --> 23:34.845
So we keep them in the game till
we figure out where they are?

23:34.847 --> 23:35.913
Yeah.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.448
All right.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.454
WINNIE:
<i> Sarge, uniforms confirm</i>

23:43.456 --> 23:45.089
no sign of Maya Fraser
at the house.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.991
And they report signs
of forced entry.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.443
Thanks, Winnie.

23:48.444 --> 23:49.894
I got a hit on your guy
Justin Fraser.

23:49.896 --> 23:50.828
Criminal record?

23:50.830 --> 23:51.796
No, family services.

23:51.798 --> 23:52.863
Go ahead.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.131
Okay, both parents deceased.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.966
Looks like he was 13.

23:55.968 --> 23:58.669
He was transferred to the
custody of a Jack Fraser.

23:58.671 --> 23:59.837
Uncle, in Brampton.

23:59.839 --> 24:01.138
Okay, let's get ahold
of the uncle.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.506
See if he can tell us

24:02.508 --> 24:03.941
what Justin's got
himself involved in.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.876
You got it.

24:05.878 --> 24:09.013
So how are you going to
find these codes we need?

24:09.015 --> 24:11.615
The override codes change
every few weeks,

24:11.617 --> 24:13.717
so the execs have got
to write them down somewhere.

24:13.719 --> 24:15.820
MIKE:
What are we
looking for?

24:15.822 --> 24:18.055
It's, uh, it's usually
something personal.

24:18.057 --> 24:19.890
Like a... like a birthday.

24:19.892 --> 24:22.793
Or a cat?

24:30.136 --> 24:31.535
(typing)

24:31.537 --> 24:32.870
JACK:
<i> Justin's a good kid.</i>

24:32.872 --> 24:34.705
Smart. My brother's son.

24:34.707 --> 24:37.141
He came to live with me
after he lost his parents.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.843
So what happened
to the parents?

24:38.845 --> 24:41.145
Uh... car accident.

24:41.147 --> 24:43.214
As far as you know,
Justin isn't involved

24:43.216 --> 24:44.782
in illegal activities?

24:44.784 --> 24:47.952
Well, he studied his butt off
to get where he is,

24:47.954 --> 24:49.753
Maya's expecting-- no, I...

24:49.755 --> 24:51.755
I don't see him
throwing that away.

24:51.757 --> 24:54.992
Well, are they okay?
What do you know
about Mike McKewon?

24:54.994 --> 24:56.927
Oh, so this is about Mike.

24:56.929 --> 24:58.629
No.

24:58.631 --> 25:02.266
Look, I had three kids
of my own, okay?

25:02.268 --> 25:04.168
I couldn't take them both.

25:04.170 --> 25:05.269
Besides, he was 17.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.605
He was old enough
to be on his own.

25:07.607 --> 25:10.007
So you're saying Justin
and Mike are brothers?

25:10.009 --> 25:11.642
No, no, half.

25:11.644 --> 25:14.178
His mom remarried my brother
when Mike was two or three.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.013
Then they had Justin.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.548
But the kid's always
been trouble.

25:17.550 --> 25:18.949
Not even my brother
could handle him.

25:18.951 --> 25:21.018
There was no way
I could take that on.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.987
So after the accident,
Justin got a home,

25:22.989 --> 25:25.155
and Mike was left
to look out for himself?

25:25.157 --> 25:27.191
Yeah.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.826
Are you in?
(computer trills)

25:28.828 --> 25:30.194
Yeah.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.896
How'd you know
the name of the cat?

25:31.898 --> 25:32.997
I didn't.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.632
The password is on the back.

25:34.634 --> 25:36.800
(typing rapidly)

25:38.638 --> 25:40.871
Okay, all right, it's scanning
the system for the codes now.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.907
Once we get them,
we take them down

25:42.909 --> 25:44.208
to the secure servers
in the basement,

25:44.210 --> 25:47.011
input them, send the cash.

25:47.013 --> 25:49.079
Then they let Maya go.

25:51.918 --> 25:54.552
How long has Maya
been pregnant?

25:54.554 --> 25:56.987
Seven months.

25:58.858 --> 26:01.091
You got a boy or a girl?

26:03.162 --> 26:05.195
We don't know, Mike.

26:05.197 --> 26:06.830
We were going to wait.

26:06.832 --> 26:08.265
I'm sorry.

26:12.338 --> 26:15.005
I've been working on
the video attachment
for Mike's phone.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.874
MAYA:
Justin...

26:16.876 --> 26:19.076
please.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.812
They want their money by 6:00

26:21.814 --> 26:23.914
or they say they'll...
they'll kill me.
(sirens wailing)

26:23.916 --> 26:25.983
You hear that? Sirens.

26:25.985 --> 26:27.651
Sounds like a cruiser.

26:27.653 --> 26:28.919
They want their money by 6:00...
(sirens wailing)

26:28.921 --> 26:30.988
And an ambulance.
...or they say they'll kill...

26:30.990 --> 26:33.123
The message was
sent at 5:01 p.m.

26:33.125 --> 26:36.660
I got Winnie to send me
the info on all cruiser
and ambulance calls at 5:01.

26:36.662 --> 26:38.028
Three cruisers, one ambulance.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.029
Say she's downtown.

26:39.031 --> 26:40.965
She could either be here, here

26:40.967 --> 26:43.000
or here-- Wellington and John.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.268
Club district.
Exactly.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.736
Nice work, Spike.

26:45.738 --> 26:46.904
And here, there's more.

26:46.906 --> 26:49.873
We've got a corner
of a window.

26:49.875 --> 26:51.642
Arched window,
stained glass.

26:51.644 --> 26:54.178
It could be a church.
No, not at Wellington and John.

26:54.180 --> 26:57.047
No, no, no, that's
the Viper-- a night club.
I did a drug case in there.

26:57.049 --> 26:58.315
You sure about this?

26:58.317 --> 26:59.717
DONNA:
Yeah, that makes sense.

26:59.719 --> 27:01.118
I mean, most of the
clubs in that area

27:01.120 --> 27:02.653
are hot with drug traffic.
Mostly gang controlled.

27:02.654 --> 27:04.187
A gang would have what it
takes to pull this off?

27:04.190 --> 27:06.824
DONNA:
That is the Viper.
I know the windows.

27:06.826 --> 27:07.992
Club's five minutes from here.

27:07.994 --> 27:10.094
Okay, Winnie, let's
deploy Team Four

27:10.096 --> 27:11.229
to Viper Nightclub.

27:11.230 --> 27:12.363
WINNIE:
No, sorry. Team Four
was dispatched

27:12.365 --> 27:14.164
20 minutes ago, Sarge.

27:14.166 --> 27:16.100
Domestic gun call in Rexdale.

27:16.102 --> 27:18.102
I'll put Team Three on standby.

27:18.104 --> 27:20.137
It'll take them at least
half an hour just to deploy.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.805
All right, we can be there
in five.

27:21.807 --> 27:22.906
Our hands are tied here.

27:22.908 --> 27:23.874
Besides, the threat's
at the club.

27:23.876 --> 27:24.908
PARKER:
Okay, you go.

27:24.910 --> 27:26.110
Lou, Spike
and I will Alpha here.

27:26.112 --> 27:27.845
Lewis, call Guns and Gangs.

27:27.847 --> 27:29.980
See if anything flags.
Copy that.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.082
All right, the rest of us
bravo at the club. Fast is good.

27:32.084 --> 27:34.918
We got a 6:00 deadline.
Let's stay off the news.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.353
(beeping)

27:36.355 --> 27:38.789
Wait...
(typing)

27:38.791 --> 27:39.990
I got it.

27:49.335 --> 27:52.002
(dialing)

27:52.004 --> 27:54.405
Boss, got a call going out.

27:54.407 --> 27:58.075
(phone ringing through)

27:58.077 --> 27:59.309
OSCAR:
Yeah.

27:59.311 --> 28:01.445
Okay, we've got them--

28:01.447 --> 28:03.881
the override codes
to get into the system.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.716
Now you're going to get
your money,

28:05.718 --> 28:08.152
but I want to hear her voice.

28:08.154 --> 28:10.821
Spike, where would you go
with override codes?

28:10.823 --> 28:12.606
Basement.

28:12.607 --> 28:14.390
System would have to be rebooted
from the secure servers there.

28:14.393 --> 28:15.826
There's CCTV
in the basement hallways,

28:15.828 --> 28:17.728
but there's no eyes
in the server room.

28:17.730 --> 28:20.030
Okay, well, eyes would be good.
Turn the lights off

28:20.032 --> 28:21.965
in the hallways.
Got it.

28:21.967 --> 28:23.867
Eyes flying in.

28:23.869 --> 28:26.103
(indistinct conversation)

28:30.142 --> 28:31.442
(whimpering)

28:31.444 --> 28:32.376
Don't. No!

28:32.378 --> 28:33.877
No!

28:33.879 --> 28:35.979
No, please!

28:35.981 --> 28:37.715
Please, no!

28:37.717 --> 28:39.416
We're gonna do a drive-by check
for sentries.

28:39.418 --> 28:41.285
If it's clear, we're gonna stage
in the alley

28:41.287 --> 28:44.755
south of Adelaide,
full-on stealth approach.

28:44.757 --> 28:47.224
Bad news. Guns and Gangs
says Viper's controlled
by Huesos De Tigre.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.792
South American bangers.

28:48.794 --> 28:51.128
That fits. They use
someone on the inside

28:51.130 --> 28:53.330
to hit up the bank,
and then they use kidnapping

28:53.332 --> 28:54.832
to make sure
they cooperate.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.100
LEWIS:
Gang unit's been
profiling these guys

28:56.102 --> 28:57.768
since they moved in here
three weeks ago.

28:57.770 --> 29:00.437
My... my baby!

29:00.439 --> 29:02.239
<i> Cállate! </i>
Please!

29:02.241 --> 29:04.074
This M.O. goes
one of two ways.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.843
They either don't
get the money

29:05.845 --> 29:07.411
and kill the hostage...

29:07.413 --> 29:08.512
And two?

29:08.514 --> 29:10.180
My baby, please...

29:10.182 --> 29:11.915
Please!

29:11.917 --> 29:13.517
They get the money.

29:13.519 --> 29:15.786
And they still kill the hostage.

29:15.788 --> 29:17.387
(tires squealing)

29:32.805 --> 29:34.037
(distant sirens wailing)

29:34.039 --> 29:36.373
We'll cross between
the buildings.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.242
We'll access
through the roof.
Copy that.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.277
LEWIS:
We've I.D.'d two of them.

29:40.279 --> 29:43.113
Okay, there's an Oscar Cardoza
and a Hector Puente.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.081
Just the two?

29:44.083 --> 29:45.182
No, they say
there's four,

29:45.184 --> 29:46.250
maybe five, start-up crew.

29:46.252 --> 29:47.351
WORDY:
Could it be more?

29:47.353 --> 29:48.919
There's no way
to know for sure.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.120
Sam, you're Sierra.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.421
Copy that.

29:55.060 --> 29:58.028
SPIKE:
I'm in the basement
and approaching the server room.

30:11.577 --> 30:14.144
Deploying camera.
Eyes and ears. How am I doing?

30:14.146 --> 30:16.580
Subject's two floors away.

30:20.853 --> 30:22.019
(beeping)

30:29.028 --> 30:30.828
How far down?

30:30.830 --> 30:31.995
The basement.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.831
Move. Seven minutes.

30:58.157 --> 31:00.891
(singsongy voice):
They're here.

31:00.893 --> 31:02.893
Subject's approaching
the main server.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.194
You seeing this?

31:04.196 --> 31:05.929
Got it. Stay concealed, Spike.

31:05.931 --> 31:08.599
Or the bad guy pulls the plug.
Copy, boss.

31:11.604 --> 31:13.337
That's the server?

31:13.339 --> 31:16.173
Yeah. I got to enter the codes

31:16.175 --> 31:17.908
and reboot.

31:17.910 --> 31:19.643
We get into the system
and make the transfer.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.278
Can you do that
in seven minutes?

31:21.280 --> 31:22.946
If you shut up, yes.

31:26.418 --> 31:28.118
Wordy.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.891
You're good?
Getting there.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.562
Got it.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.597
Bravo Team going in.

31:46.472 --> 31:48.538
What's going on?

31:48.540 --> 31:50.240
Main frame's powering up.

31:51.377 --> 31:54.645
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

31:56.548 --> 31:58.916
Okay, here we go.
(typing)

32:00.286 --> 32:02.619
Okay, he's got it open.

32:02.621 --> 32:04.554
He's in.

32:04.556 --> 32:05.622
(typing)

32:05.624 --> 32:07.524
(computer trilling)

32:07.526 --> 32:09.927
(typing)

32:23.709 --> 32:27.377
(phone ringing)

32:27.379 --> 32:28.979
What?

32:29.715 --> 32:32.716
What's happening, man?
I can't see you.

32:32.718 --> 32:34.418
I'm working on it.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.320
It's 6:00.
No, it's not.
I've got three minutes left.

32:36.322 --> 32:37.487
Don't play with me, man.

32:37.489 --> 32:39.323
Look, what do you want?!
What, do you want

32:39.325 --> 32:40.657
a million dollars
in your account

32:40.659 --> 32:42.726
or a mess on the floor?
I am going as fast as I can,

32:42.728 --> 32:45.529
so let me do this!
(slams down phone)

32:55.507 --> 32:58.241
(crying)

33:11.090 --> 33:13.023
(whispers):
Single subject. Armed.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.993
What about a
distraction?

33:15.995 --> 33:18.428
Bring him to us.
One less inside.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.199
(Wordy whistles)

33:23.702 --> 33:25.068
(gun cocks)

33:31.744 --> 33:33.777
(man grunts)

33:40.519 --> 33:42.719
Jus, it's time.

33:42.721 --> 33:43.720
Jus?

33:43.722 --> 33:45.322
I know, I know.

33:45.324 --> 33:48.058
Come on, come on, come on.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.726
(computer trills)

33:49.728 --> 33:51.028
Done.

33:54.566 --> 33:56.066
(computer beeping)

33:56.068 --> 33:57.667
No, no, no, no, no!

33:57.669 --> 33:59.636
What is it? Justin,
what's going on?

33:59.638 --> 34:01.104
Justin?!

34:04.043 --> 34:05.709
Justin,
what is it?

34:05.711 --> 34:07.244
It's over.

34:07.246 --> 34:09.279
It's over? Spike?

34:09.281 --> 34:11.081
Sounds like
he didn't get through.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.783
Maybe the codes were expired,
the system time-bombed...

34:12.785 --> 34:14.485
PARKER:
<i> Bravo Team,</i>

34:14.486 --> 34:16.186
deal might have fallen through.
What's your 20?

34:16.188 --> 34:19.156
One floor away.

34:20.092 --> 34:21.792
Boss, got a call going out.

34:21.794 --> 34:24.761
I'm ready.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.430
But I'm not doing it

34:26.432 --> 34:27.831
until I know Maya's alive.

34:27.833 --> 34:29.766
So will you put her
on the phone?

34:34.706 --> 34:36.339
(faintly):
Justin?

34:38.210 --> 34:42.512
(voice breaking):
Hey, sweetie. Are you okay?

34:42.514 --> 34:44.848
Did they... did...?

34:44.850 --> 34:48.585
(sobbing):
No. I'm okay.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.220
You got their money?

34:50.222 --> 34:52.456
(sobbing)

34:52.458 --> 34:55.725
I tried.

34:55.727 --> 34:57.694
I did.

34:57.696 --> 34:58.762
I know you did.

34:58.764 --> 35:02.699
I know.

35:02.701 --> 35:09.239
Have I ever told you
how much I love you?

35:10.209 --> 35:11.541
Okay,

35:11.543 --> 35:12.676
you talked.

35:16.782 --> 35:19.549
JUSTIN:
You'll have your money
in a minute.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.286
So your brother was right.

35:23.288 --> 35:25.622
What?

35:25.624 --> 35:27.557
Spike, stay alert.
Mike McKewon may be closer

35:27.559 --> 35:29.126
to this gang than we thought.

35:29.128 --> 35:30.944
Copy, boss.

35:30.945 --> 35:32.761
He's always talking
about you, man.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.498
You're the
smart one,
right?

35:34.500 --> 35:35.799
You know him?

35:35.801 --> 35:39.236
He wasn't doing too good today,
man, you know?

35:39.238 --> 35:41.138
And then he tells us,

35:41.140 --> 35:45.342
"My brother Justin,
he works for a bank,"

35:45.344 --> 35:49.913
and that you'd take care
of it... like you always do.

35:49.915 --> 35:53.817
He's a lucky guy
to have a brother like you.

35:55.220 --> 35:56.419
PARKER:
Spike,

35:56.421 --> 36:00.323
stay close. We got a situation.
(dialing)

36:00.325 --> 36:03.593
Jus, Jus, look, there's gotta be
something else we can do, right?

36:03.595 --> 36:05.495
(phone rings)
Huh? You know?

36:05.497 --> 36:07.430
We can do something
else, man. Come on.

36:07.432 --> 36:09.699
Just get back
in there and, um...

36:09.701 --> 36:10.767
Right, Jus?

36:10.769 --> 36:12.569
(ringing continues)

36:12.571 --> 36:16.273
I'll take care of things...

36:16.275 --> 36:18.341
like I always do.

36:28.453 --> 36:31.254
Jus, man, what
the hell, man?

36:31.256 --> 36:33.690
Get the, get the,
get the gun off me.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.258
You said you didn't know them.

36:35.260 --> 36:36.593
They knew you.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.762
And you told them
I work at a bank.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.330
No, no, man,
that's not what happened.

36:40.332 --> 36:42.115
Stop lying to me!

36:42.116 --> 36:43.899
(indistinct radio transmission)

36:43.902 --> 36:45.869
Spike, he's not picking up.
You get in there.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.337
We're on our way.

36:47.339 --> 36:49.206
MIKE:
No, that's not
what happened.

36:49.208 --> 36:50.774
SRU! Drop your weapon!

36:54.947 --> 36:58.982
My wife is dead, so you...
you do what you need to do.

36:58.984 --> 37:00.650
It doesn't matter
anymore.

37:00.652 --> 37:03.954
Justin, we're working
on getting your wife out safely.

37:03.956 --> 37:05.956
You told them
that I would do this for you,

37:05.958 --> 37:08.792
because... because
I always cave, right?

37:08.794 --> 37:10.293
Because I always say yes.

37:10.295 --> 37:12.729
They were gonna kill me, man.

37:12.731 --> 37:15.232
So you sell me out?

37:15.234 --> 37:16.433
And Maya?

37:16.435 --> 37:21.671
Okay, I do know those guys,
I know 'em.

37:21.673 --> 37:26.576
But I never thought
they'd take Maya, man.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.979
I didn't even know
about the half a million.

37:28.981 --> 37:30.880
So you're just stupid.

37:30.882 --> 37:33.984
And now you've killed my wife
and my baby.

37:33.986 --> 37:37.020
PARKER:
Justin, we know
where your wife is.

37:37.022 --> 37:38.922
We're here to help you.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.823
My team is working on
getting her right now.

37:40.826 --> 37:41.992
You're lying.

37:41.994 --> 37:43.360
No, no. We're doing
everything we can

37:43.362 --> 37:45.028
to make sure she comes out
of there safely,

37:45.030 --> 37:46.830
but hurting your brother's
not gonna help anything.

37:46.832 --> 37:49.332
This is his fault.

37:49.334 --> 37:51.801
This is your fault!

37:51.803 --> 37:54.471
He wrecks everything
he touches!

37:54.473 --> 37:56.940
Blaming him's not the answer,
my man.

37:56.942 --> 37:59.576
You both lost
your parents.

37:59.578 --> 38:01.745
I can't even imagine
what that was like.

38:01.747 --> 38:03.913
And then you both had
to go your separate ways,

38:03.915 --> 38:06.750
but you got to stay with family.
Mike wasn't so lucky, was he?

38:06.752 --> 38:08.685
He made his own luck.

38:08.687 --> 38:10.353
He's been making
his luck ever since.

38:10.355 --> 38:12.956
Yeah, I'm just saying
from his point of view,

38:12.958 --> 38:15.659
you got the roof over your head,
you got to go to school.

38:15.661 --> 38:17.994
So when he's in trouble
he comes to you

38:17.996 --> 38:21.364
because you owe
him, right?

38:21.366 --> 38:25.302
So he messes up,
you always help him.

38:25.304 --> 38:26.303
He counts on you,

38:26.305 --> 38:28.038
and you never let him down.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.839
So, this is my fault?

38:29.841 --> 38:32.642
I think your only
fault is that you're
always helping him.

38:32.644 --> 38:36.313
It's hard not to help
someone you love, though, right?

38:36.315 --> 38:40.850
So, come on, my man.
Let someone help you for once.

38:40.852 --> 38:43.586
We're gonna get
your wife out of there.

38:44.856 --> 38:47.457
We're gonna get
your wife out.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.559
Get your hands
on your head!

38:49.561 --> 38:50.860
Get your hands
on your head!

38:50.862 --> 38:52.429
Hands on your head!
Hands on your head!

38:56.601 --> 38:58.702
(dialing tones)

38:58.704 --> 39:00.370
WORDY:
Boss, we're at the door.

39:00.372 --> 39:02.505
(phone rings)

39:02.507 --> 39:05.442
Answer the phone.

39:05.444 --> 39:06.776
(ringing continues)

39:06.778 --> 39:08.078
(phone beeps on)

39:09.348 --> 39:10.980
Spread the word, man,

39:10.982 --> 39:12.982
'cause this is
what happens when
you break your promise

39:12.984 --> 39:14.584
with Huesos De Tigres!

39:14.586 --> 39:17.087
No, please don't. Don't do
anything to her, please.

39:17.089 --> 39:18.021
You listening?!

39:18.023 --> 39:18.955
(gun cocks)

39:18.957 --> 39:20.457
No, no, no!

39:20.459 --> 39:22.792
'Cause this is what
it sounds like!

39:26.732 --> 39:29.999
SRU! Get down
on the ground!

39:30.001 --> 39:32.736
Stay down on the ground or you
will be shot! Do not move!

39:32.738 --> 39:34.104
Do not move!

39:34.106 --> 39:36.005
Put it down.
Put the gun down.

39:36.007 --> 39:38.108
You heard me.
Put it down.

39:38.110 --> 39:41.411
Back off
or I'll kill the bitch!

39:41.413 --> 39:42.779
(Maya sobbing)

39:42.781 --> 39:45.548
(quietly):
No solution. Sierra...

39:47.152 --> 39:48.685
No solution.

39:48.687 --> 39:51.121
It's over.

39:52.424 --> 39:53.423
(gunshot)

39:53.425 --> 39:54.691
(Maya shrieks)

39:54.693 --> 39:56.926
What's going on?!
What happened?!

39:56.928 --> 39:58.962
(Maya sobbing)

40:03.935 --> 40:06.436
(sobbing continues)

40:09.107 --> 40:11.775
Hostage secured. We got her.

40:11.777 --> 40:14.144
(sobbing continues)

40:15.747 --> 40:19.516
It's okay. It's okay.
We got you. We got you.

40:20.519 --> 40:22.085
It's okay.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.053
You're all right.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.122
Let me hear her voice.

40:26.124 --> 40:27.123
Let me hear her.

40:27.125 --> 40:28.758
Eddie, put her on.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.694
(Maya sobbing)

40:31.696 --> 40:34.197
(Justin sobbing)

40:43.442 --> 40:47.177
PARKER:
How's Donna?
She done with SIU?

40:47.179 --> 40:49.646
You know, we were lucky
to have her there today.

40:49.648 --> 40:51.448
We're lucky to have her,

40:51.450 --> 40:52.649
Mm-hmm.
you know?

40:52.651 --> 40:54.184
And I've been thinking,

40:54.186 --> 40:55.718
she's as good as any one of us.

40:55.720 --> 40:58.221
Any one of us, Greg.
Maybe even better.

40:58.223 --> 41:00.089
And you're asking why I'm not
putting the best person

41:00.091 --> 41:01.191
for the job on the team?

41:01.193 --> 41:02.892
It's crossed my mind.

41:02.894 --> 41:05.562
Hey, a team's alchemy.

41:05.564 --> 41:08.231
It's more than the sum
of its parts, right?

41:08.233 --> 41:09.232
Donna is great,

41:09.234 --> 41:10.834
but Jules is...

41:10.836 --> 41:12.569
Jules is family,
and I get that.

41:12.571 --> 41:15.905
And I'm behind you a hundred
percent, and you know that.

41:15.907 --> 41:18.107
And I will welcome her
back with open arms.

41:18.109 --> 41:20.176
She's a great
team member.

41:20.178 --> 41:22.112
But I gotta ask you:

41:22.113 --> 41:24.047
When the call comes in,
are we sending in a SWAT team

41:24.049 --> 41:25.148
or are we sending in family?

41:25.150 --> 41:27.250
(footfalls, knocking)

41:27.252 --> 41:29.018
Got a sec?

41:29.020 --> 41:32.589
PARKER:
Yeah, come on in.

41:32.591 --> 41:36.259
Hey, you were
excellent out
there today.

41:36.261 --> 41:39.762
Excellent, and I want you
to know that.

41:39.764 --> 41:41.698
Thank you.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.132
Okay.

41:49.908 --> 41:51.074
Donna...

41:51.076 --> 41:53.710
Can I make this easier on you?

41:53.712 --> 41:55.778
Team Three's got a spot for me.

41:55.780 --> 41:58.281
They say,
got my name all over it.

41:58.283 --> 42:01.251
And how do you feel about that?

42:04.723 --> 42:07.257
I'm not here to upset your
team's center of gravity.

42:07.259 --> 42:09.726
Call me if you need me.

42:09.728 --> 42:12.295
You need me, I'm gonna be here.

42:12.297 --> 42:15.732
(ballad intro playing)

42:22.607 --> 42:25.074
¶ I'm just a star ¶

42:28.046 --> 42:32.248
¶ I'm just piece of light ¶
