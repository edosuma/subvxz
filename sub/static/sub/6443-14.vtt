Let's do this

00:19.124 --> 00:20.587
uh-huh

00:30.426 --> 00:32.183
Be right with you

00:42.932 --> 00:44.364
Hello...?

00:55.113 --> 00:56.647
Hey, fellas.

02:23.275 --> 02:24.738
Hercules.

02:29.869 --> 02:31.402
What happened in there?

02:31.403 --> 02:34.078
I don't know. Get him inside.

02:37.789 --> 02:39.096
Load up!

02:47.733 --> 02:49.450
Where the hell's Einstein?

02:49.451 --> 02:50.959
Call him back.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.088
<i>Hey, this is Chloe. I'm
not in right now, so</i>

03:02.114 --> 03:04.358
<i>leave a message and I'll
get right back to you.</i>

03:04.359 --> 03:05.670
Hey, Chloe, it's Lo.

03:05.671 --> 03:08.477
I'm officially out of the dorm and on
my way back to the Kents'.

03:08.478 --> 03:11.323
But I realized I'm still
getting my mail at your place.

03:11.324 --> 03:13.038
Can you bring it by in the morning?

03:13.226 --> 03:15.403
Okay, thanks. Bye.

03:26.733 --> 03:29.310
Oh, my God. What have I done?

03:37.806 --> 03:39.249
Oh my God

03:40.108 --> 03:42.537
Ok... I didn't see you. Ok...

03:42.538 --> 03:44.856
We're gonna get you out of here.

03:49.081 --> 03:50.043
Ok

03:51.723 --> 03:54.549
You're gonna be fine.
I know you're gonna be fine.

03:54.550 --> 03:57.028
Everyone I've ever hit was all right.

Original Airdate Feb. 16, 2005

05:23.302 --> 05:24.312
Hey.

05:24.441 --> 05:26.980
I was just getting in. What are you guys doing?

05:27.505 --> 05:29.242
We seem to have a visitor.

05:29.243 --> 05:31.068
A hungry visitor.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.874
Hey, he's supposed to be tied up in...

05:34.559 --> 05:35.768
the barn.

05:36.367 --> 05:38.177
I chained him to a post
for a second so that

05:38.180 --> 05:40.440
I could get my stuff out
of the car and well...

05:43.005 --> 05:44.163
Yeah.

05:51.504 --> 05:54.081
I had him chained right there.

05:54.897 --> 05:57.688
Okay, that's just bad wood.

05:57.689 --> 05:59.205
That's not my fault.

06:00.660 --> 06:02.558
How'd that post break?

06:08.077 --> 06:10.477
Oh, my allergies...

06:10.478 --> 06:12.672
Where did you say you found him?

06:12.673 --> 06:15.262
Actually, I kind of...

06:16.513 --> 06:17.671
hit him.

06:17.886 --> 06:20.327
You hit him?
With your car?

06:20.328 --> 06:22.772
No, with my fist.

06:23.126 --> 06:26.361
I was gonna call the vet,
but when I got in just now,

06:26.369 --> 06:27.372
he seemed fine.

06:27.372 --> 06:29.614
I think you need to make
some fliers in the morning.

06:29.615 --> 06:31.820
That way, maybe we can figure
out who he belongs to.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.370
He's got a collar. I'm sure
somebody's missing him.

06:35.104 --> 06:36.676
Fine with me.

06:40.548 --> 06:43.892
Actually, it might be
fun to have a dog around.

06:48.532 --> 06:51.172
Maybe if we can't find out
who owns him, we can keep him.

06:51.173 --> 06:53.565
Why don't we just see
what happens tomorrow, Clark?

06:53.566 --> 06:56.724
Yeah, don't get too attached.

06:57.220 --> 06:59.054
I'm going to bed.

07:01.356 --> 07:02.984
We should all get some sleep.

07:02.985 --> 07:06.237
You know, I'm gonna do my chores.

07:06.287 --> 07:08.260
It's three o'clock in the morning.

07:08.430 --> 07:11.241
Dad, since Lois is staying
here, if I'm gonna do my work

07:11.267 --> 07:14.028
at super speed, I have to do
it when she's not looking.

07:14.372 --> 07:16.668
All right, then why
don't you start with that?

07:17.131 --> 07:18.257
Come on.

07:44.818 --> 07:48.039
Well, at least I don't have
to hide anything from you.

08:07.149 --> 08:08.760
- Hey, Chloe.
- Hey.

08:08.859 --> 08:11.264
Lois, uh, had her mail
forwarded to my apartment.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.016
Is she around?

08:12.017 --> 08:13.762
Yeah, she's probably still in the,

08:13.842 --> 08:14.933
 uh...shower.

08:15.009 --> 08:16.182
Who's the puppy?

08:16.183 --> 08:18.205
We don't know his name.
Lois found him.

08:18.206 --> 08:21.133
She's bringing home
strays now, huh?

08:22.007 --> 08:23.788
How is the new tenant?

08:23.789 --> 08:24.856
Lois?

08:24.857 --> 08:27.663
Well, she, uh, re-recorded
our answering machine...

08:27.664 --> 08:30.641
...uses all the hot water, oh,
and she took over my bedroom.

08:30.642 --> 08:32.392
- She's doing great.
- Ok.

08:32.578 --> 08:33.899
How are you?

08:35.092 --> 08:38.655
I don't know. It's just kind of hard to be
myself with her around.

08:40.578 --> 08:42.674
Yeah, but now you got this guy.

08:42.820 --> 08:45.237
You can be yourself around him, right?

08:48.421 --> 08:50.337
And I'm always around.

08:55.119 --> 08:57.239
Ooh, it's cold.

08:57.925 --> 08:59.779
I'm gonna go see if I can find her.

08:59.780 --> 09:01.382
All right. I'll be right in.

09:01.383 --> 09:02.264
Ok

09:02.451 --> 09:03.610
Come on.

09:07.923 --> 09:09.686
We'll see if this'll hold you.

09:18.570 --> 09:19.717
Good boy.

09:24.145 --> 09:25.341
Stay.

09:53.161 --> 09:54.147
Holy...

09:56.358 --> 09:57.368
Hey

09:57.849 --> 10:00.549
Looks like you got a secret too.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.489
Where are you from?

10:03.743 --> 10:05.309
Good boy.

10:18.991 --> 10:21.025
- What did you do?
- What?

10:21.645 --> 10:23.950
Oh, I, um... it must have rolled.

10:24.052 --> 10:25.381
Through a fence?

10:26.516 --> 10:28.390
Yeah, weird, huh?

10:29.064 --> 10:30.176
Yeah.

10:30.177 --> 10:31.484
Yeah, weird.

10:33.218 --> 10:35.213
But, I mean, it happens, you know?

10:35.214 --> 10:38.346
The emergency brake must've slipped or something.

10:38.347 --> 10:40.224
It's old, you know? It's an old tractor.

10:40.225 --> 10:41.556
It is old.

10:42.632 --> 10:44.601
Anyway, I'm gonna get going.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.772
- I'll see you guys around.
- Bye.

10:49.628 --> 10:52.648
Just playing with Skippy here.

10:53.714 --> 10:55.837
We're not gonna call him Skippy.

10:55.838 --> 10:57.973
Okay, Lois, what
would you like to call him?

10:57.974 --> 11:01.038
Let's see. He's annoying,
and I can't seem to

11:01.064 --> 11:03.918
get within ten feet of him
without getting sick...

11:03.951 --> 11:06.000
I think we should call him Clarkie.

11:06.618 --> 11:09.010
Come here, Clarkie! Come here, boy!

11:09.013 --> 11:12.100
I made him some fliers.
He can be somebody else's allergy now.

11:12.101 --> 11:13.626
You know what? I don't think
we're gonna have to use those.

11:13.632 --> 11:15.752
I found one of those microchip
ID tags under his skin.

11:15.753 --> 11:18.028
I think they can scan it
at the animal shelter.

11:18.029 --> 11:20.026
I spent all morning on these

11:24.043 --> 11:24.805
I'll be right back.

11:24.831 --> 11:26.753
I have to tell my
parents something.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.286
Don't give me that look.

11:34.423 --> 11:35.375
Clarkie.

11:42.927 --> 11:44.147
We should probably
get your mom a

11:44.155 --> 11:45.813
new pot roast while we're out.

11:46.459 --> 11:48.407
Sit, Clarkie.

11:49.136 --> 11:50.418
Good dog.

12:03.790 --> 12:05.121
Hey, Shhh

12:09.238 --> 12:10.249
Hi

12:10.683 --> 12:12.079
How can I help you guys?

12:12.080 --> 12:13.826
- We found this dog.
- Actually,

12:13.827 --> 12:15.505
I found him.

12:15.506 --> 12:17.775
Well, hit him actually.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.542
Not hard.

12:19.543 --> 12:20.963
We call him Clarkie.

12:20.964 --> 12:22.301
We don't call him Clarkie.

12:22.302 --> 12:24.579
Is it the "ie" part
you don't like? Because...

12:24.580 --> 12:26.469
We could always
just make it Clark.

12:26.495 --> 12:29.250
But then that would get
really confusing, and hey...

12:29.276 --> 12:32.012
Maybe you should consider
changing your name.

12:32.340 --> 12:34.153
You could be Skipper.

12:34.378 --> 12:36.743
Anyway, uh, we think he
might have an ID chip.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.030
We were wondering if you
could scan it for us.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.818
If it's not too much trouble.

12:44.685 --> 12:47.558
Um, well, sure, I guess.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.220
Whoa! Easy, boy.

12:52.221 --> 12:55.261
Yeah. He doesn't seem
to have a lot of love for you.

12:55.262 --> 12:56.890
Maybe I should do that.

13:01.652 --> 13:03.008
Bless you.

13:04.094 --> 13:05.142
Thanks

13:10.978 --> 13:12.092
Luthorcorp?

13:12.093 --> 13:13.450
You're kidding.

13:13.659 --> 13:14.568
Huh.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.606
It must be one of those
lab dogs or something.

13:17.607 --> 13:18.988
Lab dogs?

13:20.228 --> 13:23.069
I'd be happy to take him off your hands
and return him for you.

13:23.070 --> 13:25.252
Actually, you know what?

13:26.287 --> 13:29.022
Um, that's okay. We'll take care of it.

13:29.023 --> 13:30.299
Thanks.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.988
Come on, boy. Come on.

13:33.036 --> 13:35.360
I should probably get
your name and address, though...

13:35.361 --> 13:37.824
in case someone from LuthorCorp calls.

13:38.059 --> 13:39.588
It's policy.

13:40.760 --> 13:42.420
Would you mind taking
him back to the farm?

13:42.426 --> 13:44.048
I'm gonna go talk to Lex.

13:44.623 --> 13:46.238
Terrific.

13:46.549 --> 13:49.113
Come on. Let's go sneeze a while.

13:49.414 --> 13:50.930
Heel, Clarkie.

13:55.993 --> 13:57.078
Thanks

14:06.264 --> 14:07.546
Hey, Josh

14:08.601 --> 14:10.339
Guess who just showed up?

14:12.299 --> 14:13.705
Einstein

14:14.624 --> 14:15.549
Yeah,

14:15.552 --> 14:18.624
Some guy named Clark Kent's
keeping him out on his farm.

14:20.580 --> 14:22.947
That's good news little brother.

14:25.725 --> 14:27.605
‘Cause I was thinking that
we were gonna have to

14:27.610 --> 14:29.803
rob that truck tomorrow
with just this dummy.

14:34.406 --> 14:36.341
Why do you have to do that?

14:39.198 --> 14:40.677
What do you care?

14:44.106 --> 14:45.820
It's just a dog.

14:50.920 --> 14:52.917
How's he doing, anyway?

14:53.342 --> 14:55.097
He's got a couple hours left in him

14:55.098 --> 14:59.791
long enough to help us get Einstein back.
And then we can shoot them both up and...

15:00.722 --> 15:02.855
get their strength back for tomorrow.

15:03.540 --> 15:04.890
So how come you
guys couldn't get

15:04.895 --> 15:06.937
the effect to last
longer anyway?

15:10.978 --> 15:14.085
I don't know, Zack. I was just a trainer.

15:22.025 --> 15:24.269
The plan's back on, little brother.

15:24.570 --> 15:26.444
Let's close up shop, huh?

15:27.154 --> 15:28.868
Yeah sure.

15:38.643 --> 15:39.974
Genevieve...

15:40.991 --> 15:42.779
What a surprise.

15:42.941 --> 15:44.626
If you're looking for
Jason, I sent him

15:44.630 --> 15:46.761
to Metropolis on a business errand.

15:46.862 --> 15:49.270
Actually, I came here to see you, Lex.

15:49.271 --> 15:52.650
Oh, I didn't realize we had
any more business to discuss.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.004
Drink?

15:58.071 --> 16:02.238
I take it my son has
proven to be a good hire.

16:02.251 --> 16:03.447
Excellent.

16:03.648 --> 16:06.888
He's taken a real passion
for the project I've given him.

16:07.884 --> 16:12.944
I gather this project does not require him
to relocate out of Smallville.

16:12.945 --> 16:14.779
Highly doubtful.

16:16.911 --> 16:19.389
I underestimated you, Lex.

16:19.506 --> 16:21.701
Well, that's a common mistake.

16:22.770 --> 16:25.159
But not one I usually make.

16:27.159 --> 16:30.352
Seems that headstrong
young men have...

16:30.728 --> 16:32.886
become my blind spot.

16:33.933 --> 16:35.634
Ask Jason.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.388
And now you.

16:40.379 --> 16:43.757
You asked me to give Jason
a position at LuthorCorp.

16:43.796 --> 16:46.361
I'm not sure I
understand your problem.

16:47.977 --> 16:51.565
You know exactly why
I wanted you to hire Jason.

16:52.075 --> 16:54.538
Get him away from Lana Lang.

16:55.219 --> 16:59.979
But instead, you decided to
co-opt him for your own purposes.

17:01.557 --> 17:02.741
Genevieve...

17:04.199 --> 17:08.453
Paranoia is not a very
attractive quality in a woman.

17:10.047 --> 17:13.092
I'm just trying
to protect my son.

17:14.426 --> 17:18.295
Well, maybe you should get together with
my father and write a parenting book.

17:18.607 --> 17:20.789
I bet it'd be a bestseller.

17:24.675 --> 17:27.364
Then you're no longer
interested in how

17:27.390 --> 17:29.942
your father was
released from prison?

17:30.712 --> 17:34.403
I've chosen to believe
my father truly is reformed.

17:34.404 --> 17:38.597
Therefore, the question of his guilt
or innocence no longer bothers me.

17:39.136 --> 17:41.996
But it's great seeing
you again, Genevieve.

17:44.947 --> 17:47.142
And you too, Lex.

17:49.843 --> 17:52.321
Give my best to Jason.

17:54.528 --> 17:58.224
It's a shame he won't
be able to help you...

17:58.225 --> 18:00.888
find what you're looking for.

18:34.041 --> 18:37.801
It's hard to believe he's
as strong as Clark says he is.

18:37.802 --> 18:40.119
He certainly is a beautiful dog.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.343
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I know what you're thinking.

18:43.344 --> 18:45.254
Well, it might be nice
for Clark to have a dog.

18:45.265 --> 18:47.261
It's been kind of a
lonely year for him.

18:47.518 --> 18:49.419
Well, wait a minute.
What happens when

18:49.445 --> 18:51.474
Clark goes off to
college next year, huh?

18:51.675 --> 18:54.938
Who winds up having
to take care of that dog? Me.

18:55.359 --> 18:58.207
Lois, it's time for dinner!

19:05.095 --> 19:07.388
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

19:08.242 --> 19:09.598
You see?

19:09.651 --> 19:10.577
Well,

19:10.578 --> 19:13.863
remember when Clark did that?
He was only three.

19:13.864 --> 19:15.799
It's not funny. Hey!

19:22.175 --> 19:23.618
What happened?

19:24.922 --> 19:26.734
That's my T-bone!

19:28.539 --> 19:30.684
Oh, bad dog.

19:35.600 --> 19:36.721
Clark

19:36.727 --> 19:39.121
Grab a stick. I was
just about to break.

19:39.122 --> 19:42.399
Lex, is LuthorCorp
doing experiments on dogs?

19:43.417 --> 19:45.342
I'm not really sure
that's any of your business.

19:45.343 --> 19:49.078
Lois found a stray dog.
It has a LuthorCorp ID tag.

19:50.782 --> 19:51.965
Are you?

19:52.978 --> 19:55.926
Clark, when I took over the
company, I found quite a few

19:55.952 --> 19:59.241
irregular experiments being
conducted at my father's request.

19:59.342 --> 20:01.925
One of them involved animal testing.

20:06.546 --> 20:08.382
What were they doing?

20:11.591 --> 20:13.739
If I remember correctly, they were...

20:13.740 --> 20:18.597
mixing meteor rock with a steroid to
enhance canine strength.

20:18.728 --> 20:22.612
Why would your dad be interested
in making super-powered dogs?

20:26.478 --> 20:29.597
If I understood my father's insanity, Clark,

20:29.598 --> 20:31.990
I'd be a much happier man.

20:32.768 --> 20:36.738
But I suppose in this case,
there were military applications.

20:37.383 --> 20:41.359
I guess I'll never really know for sure.
The results were inconclusive.

20:41.534 --> 20:45.824
I had animal rights activists picketing the site
so I closed it down.

20:45.890 --> 20:48.406
I was told the
dogs were destroyed.

20:48.603 --> 20:50.308
Evidently not all of them.

20:52.646 --> 20:55.420
Is it exhibiting any problems?

20:57.049 --> 21:00.067
Is that your way of asking me
if it has super strength?

21:00.068 --> 21:01.444
No

21:02.128 --> 21:04.974
No, I assume you'd
tell me that because...

21:04.978 --> 21:08.517
I'd have quite a liability
on my hands if he did.

21:12.478 --> 21:14.746
The dog's perfectly healthy.

21:15.998 --> 21:18.697
Well, then I'm sure
the Kent farm will be...

21:18.698 --> 21:20.882
a perfect home for him.

21:34.168 --> 21:35.607
Sorry about dinner.

21:35.638 --> 21:38.473
I guess it's just sandwiches tonight.

22:00.028 --> 22:01.372
Jonathan?

22:14.568 --> 22:15.818
Jonathan!

22:15.828 --> 22:17.298
Stay back

22:19.968 --> 22:21.459
Jonathan!

22:21.708 --> 22:23.661
- Oh my god, Jonathan!
- Stay back

22:25.118 --> 22:26.242
Martha...

22:26.878 --> 22:28.507
- Get away!
- No!

22:28.508 --> 22:30.934
Get away!
Get away from him.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.027
Sweetheart.

22:54.258 --> 22:55.644
Are you ok?

22:57.708 --> 22:58.958
Are you all right?

22:59.108 --> 23:00.536
That's ok.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.293
Lois, get the car keys.

23:06.305 --> 23:08.463
We have to take him
to the hospital.

23:22.716 --> 23:24.911
Dad, what'd they say?

23:25.046 --> 23:27.256
Well, the doctor said
he'd never seen a dog

23:27.264 --> 23:28.985
that could bite clean
through bone before.

23:28.986 --> 23:30.782
Look at this.

23:31.366 --> 23:33.555
The store owner's in a coma.

23:33.556 --> 23:36.185
He was attacked by something
that could pulverize a steel door.

23:36.186 --> 23:38.095
Now the police think it's a bear, but...

23:38.096 --> 23:39.325
You think it was the dogs.

23:39.326 --> 23:42.235
Someone's obviously controlling
these dogs and using them.

23:42.236 --> 23:44.096
Look, the only people
that knew we had the dog

23:44.105 --> 23:46.380
were Lex and that guy
at the animal shelter,

23:46.396 --> 23:50.115
and since the boy billionaire probably doesn't go
around robbing convenience stores...

23:50.116 --> 23:50.975
We should check it out.

23:50.976 --> 23:53.471
Well, let's do that first thing
in the morning, all right?

23:53.480 --> 23:57.552
Um, Clark, would you give me
a hand signing out, would you?

23:59.206 --> 24:01.035
Look, son, I know that you're...

24:01.036 --> 24:02.996
really attached to this
dog, but I'm worried

24:03.005 --> 24:04.370
he could be dangerous,
even to you.

24:04.380 --> 24:06.510
I know, that's why I have to find out
who's doing this and stop them.

24:06.515 --> 24:07.880
No, Clark...

24:08.416 --> 24:10.405
Son, it won't make any difference.

24:10.406 --> 24:13.165
If they had anything to do
with putting that man in a coma...

24:13.166 --> 24:15.875
then they're gonna have to be put down.

24:16.256 --> 24:20.225
Dad, when you and mom found
a super-powered boy in a cornfield,

24:20.226 --> 24:23.195
you didn't give up on me
just because I might be dangerous.

24:23.196 --> 24:25.748
You raised me.
You gave me a chance.

24:26.736 --> 24:28.731
He's a good dog, Dad.

24:29.216 --> 24:31.852
Someone's just
using him to do bad things.

24:31.906 --> 24:33.901
We should give him a chance.

24:38.226 --> 24:41.261
I want you to leave
here with me tonight.

24:41.696 --> 24:42.820
Why?

24:44.056 --> 24:47.553
Because of Countess
Marguerite Isobel Theroux?

24:49.626 --> 24:51.737
You know that name, don't you?

24:51.936 --> 24:54.341
Is this what Lex has you doing?

24:54.806 --> 24:57.946
Researching
17th century witches?

24:58.596 --> 25:01.578
You're incapable of giving
a straight answer, you know that?

25:02.916 --> 25:07.074
So apparently when Isobel
was condemned to die,

25:07.266 --> 25:09.905
she vowed to rise again
through one of her descendants.

25:09.906 --> 25:12.765
You knew that
that was Lana, didn't you?

25:12.766 --> 25:16.536
That's why you had me
bring her to Isobel's tomb in Paris

25:16.676 --> 25:20.645
because you knew that if she received
the mark then she was the one.

25:21.976 --> 25:24.275
Which means it's--
it's my fault...

25:24.276 --> 25:25.778
that everything's happening to her.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.635
You can't blame yourself.

25:29.996 --> 25:32.380
How could you use me like that?

25:34.806 --> 25:37.315
Look, it's not safe
for you to stay here.

25:37.316 --> 25:39.311
Well, I'm not leaving Lana.

25:40.826 --> 25:44.449
Well, perhaps you'll change your mind when
you hear the rest of the story.

25:45.776 --> 25:49.252
Isobel was condemned by
a woman named Gertrude.

25:49.426 --> 25:51.025
Isobel vowed...

25:51.026 --> 25:55.720
that when she rose from the dead, that
she would wipe out all of Gertrude's heirs.

25:56.216 --> 25:58.725
We're Gertrude's ancestors, Jason.

25:58.726 --> 26:01.351
So you think that Lana
is going to kill you?

26:01.496 --> 26:02.557
No

26:03.186 --> 26:06.125
But Isobel will, and who
knows when she'll return?

26:06.126 --> 26:09.045
Mother, I walked out
on Lana once before.

26:10.536 --> 26:12.027
I'm not gonna do it again.

26:12.036 --> 26:14.525
Then you're in love with a girl...

26:15.926 --> 26:18.467
that may kill our entire family.

26:33.386 --> 26:35.948
What is it, an obstacle corse?

26:46.776 --> 26:49.013
Oh, crap!

26:56.476 --> 26:58.965
You see him anywhere?
Come here, Clarkie!

26:58.966 --> 27:00.300
Come here, boy!

27:03.216 --> 27:06.681
Wow. Could the dander
get any thicker in here?

27:06.786 --> 27:08.135
You know,
I've been thinking.

27:08.136 --> 27:09.741
Clarkie might've had
something to do with

27:09.745 --> 27:11.383
what happened at that
convenience store,

27:11.506 --> 27:12.954
but I don't think
he hurt that guy.

27:12.980 --> 27:14.825
There wasn't any blood
on him when I found him.

27:14.830 --> 27:16.355
We're not gonna call
him Clarkie, okay?

27:16.360 --> 27:17.681
We're gonna call him Bear

27:17.906 --> 27:19.445
or Bandit or something.

27:19.546 --> 27:21.394
Uh, no and no.

27:46.516 --> 27:47.687
What is all this?

27:47.706 --> 27:51.065
It's LuthorCorp payroll.
They're gonna hit an armored truck.

27:51.210 --> 27:53.000
And it's happening right now.
Lois, call the police.

27:53.008 --> 27:54.715
I'm gonna see if I can
catch up with these guys.

27:54.881 --> 27:57.540
Hold on there, Forrest Gump.
What are you gonna do, run?

27:57.541 --> 27:58.820
We brought my car, remember?

27:58.821 --> 28:00.041
Lois, look--

28:00.071 --> 28:01.830
Unh-unh. We can call
the cops on the way.

28:01.831 --> 28:03.942
You are so weird sometimes.

28:16.631 --> 28:18.590
You know, can you go a little bit faster?

28:18.591 --> 28:21.750
Hey, you were gonna be hoofing it
about ten minutes ago. Besides...

28:21.851 --> 28:23.699
I don't want to hit anything.

28:30.541 --> 28:32.179
It should be right here.

28:32.451 --> 28:34.100
Well, it's not.

28:40.351 --> 28:42.580
Let's go, let's go, come on!

28:42.581 --> 28:44.480
Get the money. Grab
the money, come on!

28:44.481 --> 28:46.907
Stop yelling at me.
I dropped the bag, okay?

28:49.211 --> 28:50.600
Wait, turn left, turn left.

28:50.601 --> 28:51.252
Why?

28:51.271 --> 28:52.815
Just do it!

29:00.281 --> 29:02.286
What is this, another one
of your famous hunches,

29:02.312 --> 29:04.130
or are we just on a
little scenic route here?

29:04.131 --> 29:05.930
- Okay, stop here.
- Wha-- where?

29:05.931 --> 29:08.430
- Here ! Stop here!
- Okay!

29:17.371 --> 29:18.925
Go, go

29:25.651 --> 29:27.360
Grab the bags, let's go!

29:27.361 --> 29:28.220
I am.

29:28.221 --> 29:29.828
Come on, faster!

29:30.691 --> 29:32.760
Those guys back there don't look so good.

29:32.921 --> 29:34.664
Forget these screwed-up guards.

29:35.371 --> 29:37.555
Get the money. Let's go!

29:42.801 --> 29:44.261
All right. Come on.

29:49.631 --> 29:51.553
Buckle up, little brother.

29:51.691 --> 29:52.962
Come on.

29:53.191 --> 29:55.564
Can you go see if
you can help those guys?

30:08.751 --> 30:10.841
It's all right, buddy.
We'll get you out of here.

30:28.751 --> 30:29.749
Clark?

31:02.670 --> 31:04.413
What's he barking about?

31:05.060 --> 31:07.599
I don't know, but in five
minutes it won't matter.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.357
We burn the truck, the
dogs, everything.

31:09.383 --> 31:10.129
All the evidence.

31:10.130 --> 31:11.138
What--

31:12.020 --> 31:15.170
We're gonna be in the Keys
before anyone knows we're gone.

31:19.100 --> 31:21.368
Where's Einstein?
- What the hell?

31:28.480 --> 31:31.159
It's that guy from the animal shelter.

31:31.160 --> 31:32.529
Well, well, well.

31:32.545 --> 31:35.516
Looks like someone
has some explaining to do.

32:14.290 --> 32:15.389
Oh Well

32:15.390 --> 32:17.784
you just had to be a hero, didn't you?

32:18.950 --> 32:21.250
Sometimes heroes get burned.

32:38.380 --> 32:39.669
Are you sure about this?

32:39.670 --> 32:41.559
He saw our faces.
We can't let him walk.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.069
This wasn't part of the plan.

32:43.070 --> 32:45.039
The plan is working, okay?

32:45.040 --> 32:47.938
We got the money and
we're almost out of here.

32:48.330 --> 32:50.787
You're not gonna chicken out
on me now, are you? Huh?

32:57.320 --> 32:58.013
No

32:59.260 --> 33:00.699
I didn't think so.

33:00.700 --> 33:01.803
Come on.

34:13.250 --> 34:15.382
Make a wish, little brother.

34:40.469 --> 34:41.993
Going somewhere?

35:48.091 --> 35:50.989
This guy's quite a hero
from what I understand.

35:51.751 --> 35:53.977
Yeah, I hope my dad lets me keep him.

35:55.121 --> 35:57.621
Doctor, you didn't
notice anything unusual

35:57.630 --> 35:59.525
about any tests you
ran on him, did you?

35:59.530 --> 36:00.843
Like what?

36:01.441 --> 36:03.435
Well, he just seems
really strong sometimes

36:03.461 --> 36:04.955
and he likes to
get into things.

36:05.031 --> 36:08.530
Well, if anything, I'd say his
strength is a little below average.

36:08.531 --> 36:11.390
You've got a perfectly normal,
healthy dog here.

36:11.391 --> 36:12.970
You thought of a name yet?

36:12.971 --> 36:15.376
I was thinking
of calling him Krypto.

36:15.621 --> 36:17.154
Interesting name.

36:20.261 --> 36:21.427
Well,

36:21.431 --> 36:22.540
I better be going.

36:22.541 --> 36:23.940
Thanks, Dr. Klein.

36:23.941 --> 36:25.033
You're welcome.

36:28.741 --> 36:29.728
Krypto

36:32.031 --> 36:33.638
What does it mean?

36:36.071 --> 36:37.121
Friendly.

36:38.191 --> 36:41.268
It's because his
background is so... cryptic.

36:42.981 --> 36:45.070
Speaking of his background,

36:45.071 --> 36:48.825
I went out to the scene of the
robbery and saw my armored truck.

36:49.055 --> 36:51.020
From the look of the back
doors, I can only assume

36:51.025 --> 36:53.784
it was the handiwork of
some very strong dogs.

36:55.101 --> 36:56.661
Lex, you told me I could
keep him back when

36:56.687 --> 36:58.080
you thought he was a
failed experiment.

36:58.081 --> 37:01.380
But Clark, if the experiment didn't fail,
this dog could be dangerous.

37:01.381 --> 37:03.124
But he's not dangerous now.

37:03.811 --> 37:05.313
He saved my life.

37:05.941 --> 37:08.377
I'll take my chances on his loyalty.

37:18.181 --> 37:20.741
So do you mind telling my
why I was up until two

37:20.755 --> 37:23.821
in the morning researching
Jason's family tree?

37:24.431 --> 37:28.670
I mean, not that it wasn't, you know,
halfway interesting, it's just...

37:28.671 --> 37:31.054
You definitely got your
place in the Guinness

37:31.070 --> 37:33.290
Book of Strangest
Last-Minute Requests.

37:33.501 --> 37:34.551
I, uh,

37:35.661 --> 37:37.919
saw him downstairs talking to his mom.

37:38.001 --> 37:40.370
It was obviously a
heated discussion, but uh...

37:40.371 --> 37:43.140
when he came up to the apartment,
he didn't even mention it to me.

37:43.141 --> 37:44.796
Well, did you hear what
they were talking about?

37:44.801 --> 37:45.620
No

37:45.931 --> 37:48.766
But it clearly rattled him.

37:49.261 --> 37:52.212
Chloe, he's keeping
something from me.

37:53.111 --> 37:57.017
You know, I don't even know
who I can trust anymore.

37:58.591 --> 38:00.439
Did you find anything?

38:01.421 --> 38:03.248
Not much.

38:03.651 --> 38:06.960
I mean, I can only go back
as far as his mom's grandmother.

38:06.961 --> 38:09.121
After that, it's like
someone just chopped off a

38:09.147 --> 38:11.792
part of his family tree.
There's nothing there.

38:11.831 --> 38:14.551
I can tell you that
she comes from a

38:14.557 --> 38:17.330
town called <i>Castelnois
de Montmiral.</i>

38:17.606 --> 38:20.315
That's all I know.
Well, except that...

38:21.516 --> 38:23.207
Lana, are you okay?

38:23.786 --> 38:24.941
Chloe...

38:25.756 --> 38:28.906
This is the town that
my ancestors come from.

38:29.466 --> 38:31.230
And Isobel Theroux.

38:33.326 --> 38:36.697
Well, on a scale of weird to ten...

38:36.896 --> 38:39.431
Genevieve's grandmother
is the one who moved

38:39.442 --> 38:41.985
Isobel's tomb into
that church in Paris.

38:42.286 --> 38:46.182
Why would anyone move
a witch's tomb into a church?

38:46.316 --> 38:48.826
I think that's something
you need to ask Jason.

39:00.326 --> 39:03.749
If you're looking for
my son, he's not here.

39:04.416 --> 39:06.135
I'm just returning something.

39:06.136 --> 39:09.265
Yes, yes. How's
the research coming?

39:10.686 --> 39:12.335
I'm not sure
I know what you mean.

39:12.336 --> 39:14.615
Yes, you do.
I mean Isobel.

39:18.996 --> 39:22.375
I understand your hesitation.
When I found out that you'd been...

39:22.376 --> 39:24.812
hired by my son, I
put a few of the

39:24.838 --> 39:27.519
pieces together and
saw a connection.

39:28.936 --> 39:30.364
You, hmm...

39:31.126 --> 39:34.077
You're Genevieve Teague's boy.

39:38.056 --> 39:39.316
Yes

39:39.916 --> 39:41.554
Of course

39:46.856 --> 39:49.103
You can't trust her, Jason.

39:50.626 --> 39:52.494
Of course, you
can't trust my son either,

39:52.520 --> 39:54.442
but I think you know that.

39:54.806 --> 39:57.652
And I suppose you're gonna
tell me I can trust you, though.

40:02.316 --> 40:03.765
What's this?

40:03.766 --> 40:05.016
Open it.

40:31.436 --> 40:33.326
I think it might help you.

40:40.806 --> 40:41.877
Done.

40:43.136 --> 40:45.446
Well, took you long enough.

40:45.986 --> 40:48.056
Now you just have to
fix the dining room table,

40:48.065 --> 40:50.006
the window, the fence, and...

40:56.656 --> 40:58.371
I thought bathing
him was supposed

40:58.380 --> 40:59.830
to help with my allergies.

41:00.046 --> 41:02.377
Well, maybe you're allergic to the soap too.

41:02.536 --> 41:04.447
Maybe I'm allergic to you.

41:05.766 --> 41:07.530
Can you grab me a towel please?

41:12.396 --> 41:13.320
Thanks.

41:14.986 --> 41:16.621
So, what are we gonna call him?

41:16.635 --> 41:18.423
And don't give me any
of this Skipper crap.

41:18.466 --> 41:20.735
I was thinking
we could call him Krypto.

41:20.736 --> 41:23.365
Why, because he's so cryptic like you?

41:23.366 --> 41:24.742
I don't think so.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.224
Why not?

41:26.646 --> 41:28.555
Because I think it's dumb.

41:28.556 --> 41:31.244
You can call your next dog Krypto.

41:31.296 --> 41:35.425
Look, it's not that hard.
Max, Lucky, Rocky, Bailey,

41:35.426 --> 41:37.415
Scamp, Monty, Bud?

41:37.416 --> 41:38.585
Hey,

41:38.586 --> 41:41.159
you're gonna have to pick one
of those if you want to keep him.

41:45.036 --> 41:45.929
Really?

41:53.366 --> 41:55.330
You know, when I was a
little girl, we had

41:55.356 --> 41:57.065
a dog that looked
just like this one.

41:57.066 --> 41:59.305
Maybe that's why
I liked him so much right away.

41:59.306 --> 42:01.049
His name was Shelby.

42:03.936 --> 42:05.522
I can live with that.

42:05.526 --> 42:07.227
Well, it beats Clarkie.

42:09.206 --> 42:10.193
yeah...

42:11.426 --> 42:14.156
Come on, Shelby!
Let's go outside.

42:27.666 --> 42:30.125
Nice catch!

42:30.126 --> 42:31.544
Come on, boy!
