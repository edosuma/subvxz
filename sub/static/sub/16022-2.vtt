00:17.150 --> 00:18.550
Woman:
It's to you, mr. Gentry.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.686
$65,000 to call.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.688
You've been playing me
all night.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.690
(sighs)

00:24.692 --> 00:26.759
In fact, I think
you're playing me right now.

00:28.195 --> 00:32.364
You think this kid's trying
to pull one over on me again?

00:32.366 --> 00:34.333
Audrey:
I couldn't say.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.068
Well, what the hell.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.604
It's only money, right?

00:40.607 --> 00:43.375
I'm all in.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.277
(murmuring)

00:47.213 --> 00:49.681
I'll call.

00:49.683 --> 00:52.684
Let's do it.

00:53.820 --> 00:56.221
(murmuring)

00:57.524 --> 01:00.659
Mr. Gentry shows a straight.

01:04.264 --> 01:07.132
Two pair. Aces and kings.

01:07.134 --> 01:08.700
(laughing):
Oh, I knew it.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.169
I got you.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.670
Three-to-one odds
in my favor.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.705
This one's finally
gonna be mine.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.107
$490,000

01:15.109 --> 01:16.241
In the pot.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.788
Oh, no. No damn way.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.624
The ace makes a full house.

01:32.626 --> 01:33.792
Tough luck, man.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.294
Maybe next time.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.695
Cash me out?

01:39.833 --> 01:41.500
Congrats.

01:41.502 --> 01:44.803
What are we looking at,
a little over $600,000?

01:45.772 --> 01:47.506
(switch clacks,
power whirrs off)

01:47.508 --> 01:49.208
Sorry, gentlemen.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.477
Back-ups will
kick in any second.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.544
In the meantime,
everybody keep your hands

01:52.546 --> 01:53.779
Away from the table, please.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.380
This is brantson.
We lost power

01:55.382 --> 01:57.583
In the rialto room.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.251
Man (over radio): That repair
crew's on its way.

02:00.153 --> 02:01.753
Gambler:
Hey, what's going on, man?

02:03.223 --> 02:06.458
(people shouting)

02:11.397 --> 02:13.499
(people screaming)

02:13.501 --> 02:15.534
(high-pitched oscillating tone)

02:25.345 --> 02:27.279
(grunting)

02:28.414 --> 02:30.649
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

02:33.186 --> 02:35.487
(engine revving)

02:37.657 --> 02:40.759
(tires squealing,
engine revving)

02:43.897 --> 02:47.199
(people screaming, shouting)

02:49.602 --> 02:52.671
(engine revving)

02:52.673 --> 02:53.672
(siren whooping)

02:53.674 --> 02:55.641
(tires screech)

02:55.643 --> 02:59.211
(engine revs, tires screech)

03:06.886 --> 03:09.454
(engine revving)

03:17.697 --> 03:19.765
(tires screeching)

03:20.700 --> 03:22.234
(siren wailing)

03:24.537 --> 03:26.471
Everybody get back!
Out of the way!

03:28.908 --> 03:30.876
(engine revving)

03:35.782 --> 03:37.783
(glass clinking)

03:41.287 --> 03:44.489
(crowd murmuring)

03:46.292 --> 03:48.760
(filtered breathing)

03:57.904 --> 04:01.340
This maniac hit the four kings,

04:01.342 --> 04:03.542
Made off
with over a million bucks.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.844
Well, I wouldn't exactly
say he "made off."

04:05.846 --> 04:09.881
Even if you leave with it,
this town has a twisted way

04:09.883 --> 04:11.383
Of getting it back
from you, doesn't it?

04:11.385 --> 04:12.851
Security guard's
pretty shaken up.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.686
He never shot anyone before.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.255
Phillips:
Well, he still hasn't.

04:16.257 --> 04:17.823
There's no wound,
there's no blood.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.858
Nothing.

04:19.860 --> 04:20.926
Stokes:
Why'd he go down?

04:20.928 --> 04:23.695
Sidle:
Ugh.

04:23.697 --> 04:24.997
What the hell happened to him?

04:26.499 --> 04:28.033
Stokes:
Whoa, he's swollen.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.601
Aah...
Akers:
Here you go.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.902
We were able to collect

04:30.904 --> 04:32.838
Just about all
the scattered cash.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.574
Are you sure the upstanding
citizens of fremont didn't try

04:35.576 --> 04:36.942
To stuff their pockets?

04:36.944 --> 04:38.977
(scoffs) with this?
Why bother? It's counterfeit.

04:41.848 --> 04:43.715
Stokes:
Yeah. Yeah, I'll say.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.685
And bad counterfeit at that.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.920
Chips are fake, too.
They're plastic.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.789
So, this guy

04:50.791 --> 04:52.658
Leaves the casino
with over a million dollars.

04:52.660 --> 04:53.659
(chips clinking)

04:53.661 --> 04:54.660
Where did it go?

04:54.662 --> 04:55.694
Stokes:
I don't know.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.462
I'd ask him, but I don't think

04:57.464 --> 04:58.897
He's gonna be much help.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.877
♪ who... Are you?

05:11.879 --> 05:14.946

(camera shutter clicking)

05:49.649 --> 05:51.850
(low, indistinct conversations)

05:55.054 --> 05:57.522
Oh, his name is paul brantson.

05:57.524 --> 06:00.125
He was only 25 years old.

06:00.127 --> 06:03.128
Married his
high school sweetheart

06:03.130 --> 06:05.464
Just six months ago.

06:10.737 --> 06:11.970
(camera shutter clicks)

06:11.972 --> 06:14.005
This is your first one back.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.375
You went through a lot.

06:18.444 --> 06:20.746
I can handle this,
if you need me to.

06:20.748 --> 06:23.048
No. I'm fine.

06:24.016 --> 06:26.518
You know, I gotta do it.
(laughs)

06:38.799 --> 06:43.068
Tell me what you told
the other police officers.

06:43.070 --> 06:46.037
I... It all happened so fast,
I, uh...

06:46.039 --> 06:48.039
Like it wasn't even real.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.041
Like when you wake up,
and you can't

06:50.043 --> 06:51.843
Even remember
what you just dreamed.

06:51.845 --> 06:55.480
Before the lights went out,
did anything happen

06:55.482 --> 06:57.482
That might have tipped you off
that something was up?

06:57.484 --> 06:59.418
Uh... I don't know.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.486
I just... I can't remember!

07:01.488 --> 07:04.856
Um... I had a glass
or two of wine.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.425
Just, I don't...
Just trying to calm

07:06.427 --> 07:08.560
My nerves. I...

07:08.562 --> 07:09.728
Sorry.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.530
Thank you. Excuse me.

07:13.032 --> 07:16.435
I talked to about
ten witnesses.

07:16.437 --> 07:19.004
Not one of them can be
sure of what they saw.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.573
This whole thing looks
like it was

07:21.575 --> 07:25.143
Designed that way--
to confuse.
(phone ringing)

07:25.145 --> 07:27.479
Oh.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.948
Says 201 area code.
That's new jersey.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.584
You still settling
nancy's estate?

07:32.586 --> 07:35.454
Mundane little things
that are just never ending.

07:35.456 --> 07:36.955
If you need to take that,
go ahead.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.024
We can handle things.
Yeah, thanks.

07:40.026 --> 07:41.626
Hey.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.161
Everything okay?

07:43.163 --> 07:44.996
(sighs) help me focus.

07:44.998 --> 07:49.768
Well, winner was cashing in
on over 600 grand.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.137
His chips on the table,
cash to match,

07:52.139 --> 07:55.640
More stolen from the cart.
Total take--

07:55.642 --> 07:58.210
Just over a million
and a half.

07:58.212 --> 08:00.979
A million and a half
that's still missing.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.849
Yeah, but the timing is
what's bothering me.

08:03.851 --> 08:08.787
The suspect knew exactly what
time to hit-- the pay-out.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.655
So he had eyes in the room.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.991
Anyone here stand out?

08:12.993 --> 08:16.027
No, but there is a guy
who's still missing.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.229
Robert gentry.

08:17.231 --> 08:19.798
<i>He was the last player</i>
<i>out of the game.</i>

08:19.800 --> 08:21.700
<i>Gone before</i>
<i>the first cops arrived.</i>

08:21.702 --> 08:23.869
You think
he's our guy in the room?

08:23.871 --> 08:25.270
Couple witnesses said

08:25.272 --> 08:29.174
That gentry and our suspect
collided during the robbery.

08:29.176 --> 08:34.145
<i>What that an accident,</i>
<i>or was it a hand-off?</i>

08:34.147 --> 08:36.548
It would explain
where the money went.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.250
Russell:
Yeah.

08:38.252 --> 08:43.088
Let's find gentry.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.823
(robbins grunting with effort)

08:44.825 --> 08:46.691
(robbins groaning, grunting)

08:50.029 --> 08:52.063
You three want
to be left alone?

08:52.065 --> 08:54.032
Very funny, finn.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.667
I could use a hand

08:55.669 --> 08:57.302
Getting these
leathers off.
Sure.

08:57.304 --> 09:01.106
Ah, it's tight.
Must have been

09:01.108 --> 09:03.141
A size or two smaller
when he bought them.

09:05.978 --> 09:07.078
Whoa.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.580
I venture to say
he was a size

09:08.582 --> 09:10.815
Or two smaller when
he put them on.

09:10.817 --> 09:13.151
Didn't start the day like this.

09:13.153 --> 09:16.154
<i>Body's swollen;</i>
<i>significant edema.</i>

09:16.156 --> 09:18.590
<i>Some sort</i>
<i>of allergic reaction, maybe.</i>

09:18.592 --> 09:22.160
Finlay: Clint tyree.
He worked at the four kings.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.763
Yeah, he rode a motorcycle
in their stunt show.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.598
Can't say I've ever seen it.

09:26.600 --> 09:30.135
Judging by these x-rays,
must be

09:30.137 --> 09:34.172
He's broken almost
every bone in his body.

09:34.174 --> 09:37.042
Hmm...

09:37.044 --> 09:40.845
Huh. Guy could have used
a new pair of boots.

09:40.847 --> 09:43.148
So what do you think caused
his allergic reaction?

09:43.150 --> 09:46.084
Well, I saw a raised mark
on his shoulder.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.854
Could be as simple
as a bee sting or spider bite.

09:49.856 --> 09:52.958
A guy robs a casino,
shoots a security guard,

09:52.960 --> 09:54.626
And rides off on
a motorcycle,

09:54.628 --> 09:56.161
And gets killed by an insect?

09:56.163 --> 09:58.196
I only said it could be.

10:00.199 --> 10:03.201
It's the left shoulder, right?

10:03.203 --> 10:06.237
Look at that.

10:06.239 --> 10:08.139
An injection mark.

10:08.141 --> 10:11.242
Somebody did this
to him on purpose.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.114
You need anything else
before I zip him up?

10:16.116 --> 10:18.183
No, no, go ahead.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.118
You can take him.
Oh.

10:23.889 --> 10:26.825
Ma'am, please...
Is that him? Is that paul?

10:26.827 --> 10:28.326
I'm so sorry, ma'am,
but you can't be here.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.894
That's my husband!

10:29.896 --> 10:31.896
I have to see him!

10:31.898 --> 10:33.665
Please?

10:33.667 --> 10:35.734
Are you sure
you want to do this?

10:35.736 --> 10:38.203
(quietly, weakly):
Please?

10:42.241 --> 10:44.309
Okay.

10:51.851 --> 10:53.385
(whimpers)
ma'am.

10:53.387 --> 10:56.087
(stifled crying)

10:56.089 --> 10:59.190
All the while
he was on active duty,

10:59.192 --> 11:01.993
Four tours of afghanistan,

11:01.995 --> 11:04.329
He wouldn't marry me.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.998
You know why?

11:07.000 --> 11:10.268
He was afraid
of making me a widow.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.303
He didn't want
to put me through that

11:12.305 --> 11:14.372
If something happened
to him over there.

11:16.308 --> 11:19.844
(sniffles, cries)

11:19.846 --> 11:22.280
I'm so sorry.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.315
(crying):
How does this happen?

11:24.317 --> 11:26.985
How does he survive
four years of hell

11:26.987 --> 11:29.320
Over there,
just to come back home

11:29.322 --> 11:33.124
And die where
he's supposed to be safe?!

11:34.326 --> 11:35.427
(sobbing):
Oh, god!

11:41.000 --> 11:42.801
(footsteps approaching)

11:42.803 --> 11:44.436
Talk to me, hodges.

11:44.438 --> 11:47.739
(speaking chinese)

11:47.741 --> 11:49.374
In english.

11:49.376 --> 11:52.477
The writing on these
newspaper bits is chinese.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.345
That, combined
with traces of carbon,

11:54.347 --> 11:56.081
Potassium nitrate and sulfur,

11:56.083 --> 11:58.149
Tells me the explosives
used in the heist

11:58.151 --> 12:00.452
Are essentially untraceable.

12:00.454 --> 12:03.254
They're chinese fireworks.
M-80s, most likely.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.423
Available at most any fireworks
stand outside the city,

12:05.425 --> 12:06.891
If you flash a little cash.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.393
Which brings us

12:08.395 --> 12:10.895
To our next potential dead end,

12:10.897 --> 12:12.230
The strobe ball.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.099
It's a visual effects device
used in the motorcycle

12:14.101 --> 12:16.401
Stunt show
of the four kings casino.

12:16.403 --> 12:20.271
The suspect could've stolen that
from his job...

12:20.273 --> 12:22.373
What about the casino's
security video?

12:22.375 --> 12:25.043
To complete
the dead-end trifecta?

12:25.045 --> 12:27.946
<i>Après moi.</i>

12:28.914 --> 12:30.348
Stokes:
Okay, there he is.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.250
That's him, right there.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.952
That's the guy
we're looking for.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.422
What's going on?

12:37.424 --> 12:39.390
It's the strobe.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.926
The camera's aperture
couldn't keep up with it.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.061
It doesn't get any better.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.329
So fix it.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.865
What do you propose I do?

12:46.867 --> 12:48.266
I don't know.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.503
We got to find out if this guy
gentry was in on this heist.

12:51.505 --> 12:52.504
You want me to do it?

12:52.506 --> 12:55.039
No, no, n... I got it.

13:00.045 --> 13:03.448
The lights in the rialto room
work just the same

13:03.450 --> 13:04.315
As the lights in
the rest of the casino.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.251
They're all automated,

13:06.253 --> 13:08.419
Controlled by a central system.
So how's the system
controlled?

13:08.421 --> 13:10.889
You have to be able to turn
the lights on and off
when you want to.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.224
Well, it's... Like
everything else these days,

13:13.226 --> 13:14.526
It's, uh... (clears throat)

13:14.528 --> 13:16.394
It's essentially...

13:16.396 --> 13:18.129
An app.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.364
You have to have
an access code.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.432
But once you're in,

13:21.434 --> 13:23.902
You can control
individual fixtures,

13:23.904 --> 13:25.370
Whatever you need.

13:29.041 --> 13:32.277
So whoever
killed the lights

13:32.279 --> 13:33.444
Should be in the system.

13:33.446 --> 13:34.879
Pretty much, he'd have to be.

13:34.881 --> 13:36.948
(chuckles)
that's a cute kid.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.217
How old is he?

13:39.219 --> 13:40.518
He's ten months old.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.053
So the real question

13:42.055 --> 13:44.222
Is who has the app?
Or the access codes?

13:44.224 --> 13:47.225
Besides me?
Uh... Security department,

13:47.227 --> 13:49.294
Hotel manager,
executive manager, I mean,
(phone ringing)

13:49.296 --> 13:50.495
Just a handful of
people, probably.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.263
Well, we're gonna need a list.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.332
I don't have
that list.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.967
I mean, I set up the system,
but the hotel manager

13:55.969 --> 13:57.468
Controls the access.

13:57.470 --> 13:58.870
Sidle:
Morgan...

13:58.872 --> 14:02.473
Our missing poker player,
rob gentry, just turned up.

14:02.475 --> 14:06.144
He was at the palermo casino,
playing with four kings chips.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.478
Hm.

14:11.984 --> 14:13.618
Stokes:
Whoo! (chuckles)

14:13.620 --> 14:15.453
You had quite a night
last night,

14:15.455 --> 14:17.622
Didn't you, mr. Gentry?

14:17.624 --> 14:21.626
First you go all in
at the rialto room, lose,

14:21.628 --> 14:24.929
Then you wind up
in this armed robbery.

14:24.931 --> 14:27.432
Yeah, I tell you,
whole thing was pretty crazy.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.100
I feel lucky just to be alive.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.902
Lucky? Oh, yeah.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.937
But you're also
a little stupid.

14:32.939 --> 14:35.206
Come on, you didn't think
we'd have every casino in town

14:35.208 --> 14:36.541
Looking for these
four kings chips?

14:36.543 --> 14:38.243
And your dumb ass rolls

14:38.245 --> 14:41.412
Into the palermo today,
buys in with 75 grand worth.

14:41.414 --> 14:42.647
Where'd you get it?

14:42.649 --> 14:45.483
Well, you know,
I can't remember if I...

14:45.485 --> 14:47.552
If I won 'em or bought 'em.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.287
I've-I've had 'em
for quite a while.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.458
You see that?

14:53.460 --> 14:55.894
It's an rfid chip.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.562
Each one of these chips

14:57.564 --> 15:00.531
Has its own digital
identification number.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.501
It helps the casino keep up
with chip movement.

15:03.503 --> 15:06.037
And these particular chips
were scanned last night

15:06.039 --> 15:09.040
As they were being put
on a cart for the rialto room.

15:09.042 --> 15:12.010
So the only way
that you could have them

15:12.012 --> 15:13.945
Is if you stole them.
Wait.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.481
I had nothing to do
with that robbery.
Yes, you did, robert.

15:16.483 --> 15:19.984
You and your motorcycle buddy?
We've got you on video

15:19.986 --> 15:22.954
Texting him, giving him
the signal to strike.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.422
You're on the hook
for murder, bud.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.392
When that robbery went down,

15:27.394 --> 15:30.061
I-I ended up on the floor.
Suddenly,

15:30.063 --> 15:32.196
I'm face-to-face
with the chip cart.
So you just

15:32.198 --> 15:34.399
Helped yourself to a handful,
is that it?

15:34.401 --> 15:36.134
I lost big
at the tables last night.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.136
It was just a way
to recoup a little.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.405
But I didn't
kill anybody.

15:40.407 --> 15:43.675
Look, maybe I can help you.

15:43.677 --> 15:45.710
Yeah? How's that?
Well, as...

15:45.712 --> 15:47.578
As I was slipping
out of there, I...

15:47.580 --> 15:49.447
I ducked into a service hallway
off the main casino.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.050
And I saw him,

15:52.052 --> 15:54.519
Saw the guy in the motorcycle
gear running away.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.220
You know that's
in the opposite direction.

15:56.222 --> 15:58.423
Well, I-I'm just telling you
what I saw.

16:00.326 --> 16:02.360
Hey, we got to run this.

16:02.362 --> 16:06.097
New security footage from
the east side of the casino.

16:06.099 --> 16:08.599
You don't know how happy
that makes me. Of course...

16:08.601 --> 16:10.535
Sets the stage
for greater disappointment.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.270
Not batting a thousand today?

16:12.272 --> 16:13.504
So far, no.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.611
Can I see that again?
It's just him

16:20.613 --> 16:22.647
Running away.
It doesn't help tie gentry

16:22.649 --> 16:25.550
To the robbery.
Will you please replay it?

16:29.254 --> 16:31.189
I was just in autopsy.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.358
I saw clint tyree's x-rays.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.661
He has multiple healed
fractures and titanium posts.

16:36.663 --> 16:40.164
There is no way
that he could run like that.

16:40.166 --> 16:43.434
This boot belongs
to clint tyree,

16:43.436 --> 16:46.337
Our stunt rider who died out
on fremont street.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.639
Check out the
wear pattern.

16:51.143 --> 16:54.479
Uneven on the outer heel, right?

16:54.481 --> 16:56.647
Guy probably had a limp.
Mm-hmm.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.516
From a lifetime
of motorcycle injuries.

16:58.518 --> 17:01.219
Now, look at this.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.687
Right after the robbery.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.556
(grunts)

17:07.526 --> 17:09.227
No limp.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.728
Not even close.
Mm-hmm.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.697
Now enlarge the boot.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.532
(beep)

17:14.534 --> 17:16.601
No wear pattern.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.469
It's a different boot.

17:18.471 --> 17:21.039
Two suspects,
identically dressed.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.774
One of them pulls off
the robbery,

17:22.776 --> 17:25.109
Makes a run for it
down the hall...

17:25.111 --> 17:26.711
To where the other one
must've been waiting.

17:26.713 --> 17:31.549
<i>Tyree knows he's playing</i>
<i>the part of a decoy.</i>

17:31.551 --> 17:34.118
But he doesn't know
he's also the patsy.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.553
And right before he rides away,

17:35.555 --> 17:37.555
<i>He gets an unexpected</i>
<i>parting gift.</i>

17:37.557 --> 17:39.490
Russell:
<i>The deadly injection.</i>

17:39.492 --> 17:41.125
(motorcycle roaring)

17:41.127 --> 17:43.261
The guy who hit
the rialto room

17:43.263 --> 17:46.531
Is not the same guy
who died out on the street.

17:53.239 --> 17:58.443
Hear you got a c.O.D. For me
on our motorcycle rider here.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.445
Well, the c.O.D. Was easy--

18:00.447 --> 18:03.648
The interesting part
is the cause.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.583
I was able
to identify the toxin

18:05.585 --> 18:08.519
That was injected
into mr. Tyree's shoulder.

18:08.521 --> 18:11.255
An extremely
aggressive coagulant.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.858
This is an exemplar sample.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.494
Watch what happens
when I add a single drop

18:16.496 --> 18:19.397
Into a beaker of blood.

18:24.336 --> 18:26.337
Russell:
Wow, look at that.

18:26.339 --> 18:28.673
Massive clotting.
In just minutes,

18:28.675 --> 18:32.110
All the blood's clotting ability
is exhausted.

18:32.112 --> 18:35.179
And as a result, massive
internal bleeding occurs,

18:35.181 --> 18:37.648
In some cases leading
to total exsanguination.
But, now,

18:37.650 --> 18:40.251
We didn't see that
with mr. Tyree here.

18:40.253 --> 18:43.221
No, because his allergy
to the toxin killed him first.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.389
Without the allergic reaction,
he would've been in

18:45.391 --> 18:47.458
For a slow
and very painful death.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.693
What was the toxin?

18:48.695 --> 18:49.794
Snake venom.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.262
A species called

18:51.264 --> 18:52.663
Daboia russelii,

18:52.665 --> 18:55.533
Commonly the russell's viper.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.703
No relation, I'm assuming?
None that
I'm aware of.

18:58.705 --> 19:02.140
You said, without the allergy,
it would've been a slow death.

19:02.142 --> 19:05.543
But mr. Tyree there was a
professional stunt rider.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.678
He could've led the cops
on a wild chase

19:07.680 --> 19:09.347
For who knows how long.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.916
But the allergy caused him to
drop in the first few minutes.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.784
Yeah, exactly.

19:13.786 --> 19:17.155
So maybe our real robber had
to change his plans.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.891
Right? Maybe he had
to do things a little faster.

19:21.226 --> 19:22.827
Thank you. Thanks.

19:24.696 --> 19:26.931
Well, you were right.
Within an hour of that robbery,

19:26.933 --> 19:29.867
We had every casino in town
looking for those chips,

19:29.869 --> 19:32.770
But we were too late--
he cashed 'em in immediately.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.939
So by the time
we sounded the alarm,

19:34.941 --> 19:37.441
Chips were already
in a casino vault.

19:37.443 --> 19:39.510
Try six different casino vaults,

19:39.512 --> 19:41.479
All sister hotels
to the four kings.

19:41.481 --> 19:44.582
The mediterranean
got a shot of our guy.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.584
There he is right there.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.718
With that disguise,

19:47.720 --> 19:49.720
It could be anybody.
Exactly.

19:49.722 --> 19:52.256
Hey, so, I've been doing some
checking on the russell's viper.

19:52.258 --> 19:53.724
Turns out this thing
is so dangerous

19:53.726 --> 19:55.860
It requires a
permit for ownership.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.361
Please tell me you found one.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.829
Right here in vegas.

19:58.831 --> 20:01.332
Guy's name is julian reese.

20:01.334 --> 20:04.569
He's a valet car parker
for the four kings casino.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.671
Another employee.

20:06.673 --> 20:07.705
Didn't show up to work today.

20:07.707 --> 20:11.909
All right, I'll follow up.
See you later.
Okay.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.511
Yeah, that works and I'll...

20:13.513 --> 20:14.912
Akers.
Hey, stokes.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.248
So, parking enforcement
spotted the car.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.251
When the plates came back to
julian reese, they called us.

20:20.253 --> 20:23.821
When we found this,
we called you.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.292
Whew.

20:30.762 --> 20:33.764
Yeah, that's our snake charmer,
all right.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.833
Looks like he got it right here.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.635
Single shot
to the head.

20:37.637 --> 20:38.836
There's a small caliber casing

20:38.838 --> 20:40.705
On the ground.
There's also

20:40.707 --> 20:42.807
Some bruising on his face.
Yeah, looks
like somebody beat him up

20:42.809 --> 20:44.675
Pretty good.
And grabbed his shirt.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.745
Looks like
there's some residue or trace.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.946
We'll get it back to the lab.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.282
So that makes two
casino employees,

20:51.284 --> 20:52.917
The stunt rider
and the valet parker,

20:52.919 --> 20:55.920
Both involved in the robbery.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.789
And both dead, which means

20:58.791 --> 21:00.791
There's at least one player left
in the game.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.994
Someone who I'm assuming
didn't want to share the money.

21:02.996 --> 21:04.762
Akers: So then what was
this guy's part?

21:13.472 --> 21:18.276
Oh, I'd say he played
a starring role.

21:36.595 --> 21:38.329
Oh, hey.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.864
Uh, I'll start
with the good news.

21:39.866 --> 21:40.998
This...

21:41.000 --> 21:42.767
Is definitely
your murder weapon.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.302
Venom from
the    <i>daboia russel</i>viper.

21:44.304 --> 21:46.070
And I found dna

21:46.072 --> 21:49.407
Consistent with clint tyree
in the hypodermic tip.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.941
However, I've been

21:50.943 --> 21:52.910
Less successful getting dna
from the leathers.

21:52.912 --> 21:55.346
There was quite a bit
of perspiration inside,

21:55.348 --> 21:58.349
So I had high hopes
initially, but no luck yet.

21:58.351 --> 21:59.950
I'm taking
another crack at it,

21:59.952 --> 22:01.052
But for now,
I can't confirm

22:01.054 --> 22:02.920
That they were worn
by julian reese.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.989
What's with the orange color?
Yeah, I'm not sure.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.090
It might have something to do

22:06.092 --> 22:07.858
With the leather-tanning
process.

22:07.860 --> 22:10.027
Thought you might be
interested to know

22:10.029 --> 22:12.063
That I have identified the trace

22:12.065 --> 22:14.632
Left in the snake charmer's
shirt lapels.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.534
Your residue looks to be pumice.

22:16.536 --> 22:17.535
Pumice?

22:17.537 --> 22:19.503
Mm...
Oh, uh,
volcanic rock.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.739
Created when super-heated,
highly pressurized igneous rock

22:21.741 --> 22:23.607
Is propelled from a volcano.

22:23.609 --> 22:26.010
Is there any reason
<i>I</i> couldn't have told her that?

22:26.012 --> 22:27.678
Guys, I know where
pumice comes from.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.013
Why would it be on his shirt?

22:29.015 --> 22:31.015
Well, it has many common uses.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.451
Such as lightweight concrete,
insulation,

22:33.453 --> 22:36.620
It's an additive in plaster and
it's even found in toothpaste.

22:36.622 --> 22:38.889
Hm. Is that it?

22:41.626 --> 22:44.128
No? If the ph is alkali,
that could indicate

22:44.130 --> 22:45.830
The presence of...
Soap.

22:46.798 --> 22:47.998
<i>Mechanic's soap.</i>

22:51.903 --> 22:54.004
Look, I can't be here.

22:54.006 --> 22:56.974
Do you hear me?
I need you

22:56.976 --> 22:59.110
To sit in that chair now.

22:59.112 --> 23:00.778
But you don't understand
what you're doing.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.413
You don't know
what's going on.
Sidle: Ryan,

23:02.415 --> 23:05.015
We found pumice
from your hand cleaner

23:05.017 --> 23:06.550
On julian reese's shirt.
Do you want

23:06.552 --> 23:07.918
To tell us how that got there?

23:07.920 --> 23:10.054
Look, I can explain everything.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.123
Okay? Just not now.

23:12.125 --> 23:15.059
I can't be here, all right?
Please.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.894
We got a warrant.

23:16.896 --> 23:20.564
It was your access code
that shut down the lights

23:20.566 --> 23:22.066
In the rialto room
for the robbery.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.467
You were in on that heist.

23:23.469 --> 23:24.902
And...

23:24.904 --> 23:26.837
You shot julian reese

23:26.839 --> 23:29.006
So that you could have
all the money to yourself.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.577
Fine, okay, don't talk.

23:33.579 --> 23:35.079
We're in your home right now,

23:35.081 --> 23:36.947
Turning it upside down,
and we're gonna find

23:36.949 --> 23:39.550
The proof that we need.

23:41.787 --> 23:43.954
Well, no sign of the money.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.990
And there's no evidence

23:45.992 --> 23:47.958
Of a female living
in the house, either.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.627
I think he divorced the wife.

23:49.629 --> 23:51.996
No divorce. She died.

23:51.998 --> 23:53.431
From cancer.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.632
These are all

23:54.634 --> 23:56.634
Condolence cards.

23:56.636 --> 23:58.636
These are all medical bills.

23:58.638 --> 24:02.506
Poor kid just
loses his mother.

24:02.508 --> 24:04.942
Now he's gonna lose
his father, too.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.777
Morgan...

24:06.779 --> 24:08.112
You gotta check this out.

24:13.952 --> 24:15.085
(phone auto-dialing)

24:15.087 --> 24:16.654
(sighs)

24:16.656 --> 24:18.589
Sara...

24:18.591 --> 24:20.925
This whole thing
just went sideways.

24:23.662 --> 24:25.062
(phone beeps off)

24:27.632 --> 24:28.999
We know what happened.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.801
They kidnapped your son.

24:32.137 --> 24:35.539
Yeah, now thanks to you,
they're gonna kill him.

24:41.046 --> 24:43.013
So, what we're gonna do
is just keep you in here.

24:43.015 --> 24:45.015
We figure the best thing
for you to do is

24:45.017 --> 24:46.917
Stay inside, in case
they try to contact you.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.752
Now, all our boys
are gonna be here.

24:48.754 --> 24:50.921
We're gonna have taps
on the phone...

24:50.923 --> 24:53.157
No, no, no, no, no-- this is
exactly what I didn't want.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.992
Hey!
They said no police.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.560
If whoever has christopher
is watching,

24:56.562 --> 24:58.762
Who knows what
they'll do to him!
Hey, listen,

24:58.764 --> 25:01.031
Man, there's a lot of people
here working really hard

25:01.033 --> 25:03.567
To help you find your boy,
and we're gonna do that,

25:03.569 --> 25:05.970
But we can't do it
unless you cooperate.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.204
Okay? Sit down,

25:07.206 --> 25:09.106
Tell me how you got
into all this mess.

25:09.108 --> 25:10.774
Come on, let's sit down.

25:13.812 --> 25:15.813
About, uh, two months ago,

25:15.815 --> 25:17.882
Julian approached me
in the employee cafeteria.

25:17.884 --> 25:20.518
Julian... Reese,
the valet dude?
He came to me
and said that there

25:20.520 --> 25:23.888
Was a couple other people who
had come up with a plan, a way
to get rich off the casino.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.656
What other people?
He didn't name names.
And to be

25:25.658 --> 25:27.591
Really honest, I didn't
take him that seriously.

25:27.593 --> 25:29.093
I mean, we see
so much money that

25:29.095 --> 25:30.961
Comes through here every day...
I mean, and everybody's

25:30.963 --> 25:32.830
Fantasizing about how
they can get some of it.

25:32.832 --> 25:35.165
Right.
But I just told him no thanks,
that I wasn't interested,

25:35.167 --> 25:37.768
Not while I have christopher
to worry about.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.737
(watch alarm beeping)

25:39.739 --> 25:41.672
What's with the alarm, man?

25:41.674 --> 25:44.041
I-I... Got to take a pill.
Yeah? Let me see that.

25:46.244 --> 25:49.213
Rifampin?
What do you take these for?

25:49.215 --> 25:51.582
Christopher's nanny, one of
the kids got meningitis,

25:51.584 --> 25:53.884
So now we're all taking
it as a precaution.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.086
Yeah, okay.
So, what did julian say

25:56.088 --> 25:58.188
When you told him
you weren't interested

25:58.190 --> 25:59.657
In his plan?

25:59.659 --> 26:01.659
He just said
it was no big deal,

26:01.661 --> 26:04.295
That that was cool...
And that was the end of it.

26:04.297 --> 26:06.897
Until yesterday morning.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.832
I went in...

26:08.834 --> 26:10.901
To take a shower
while christopher was sleeping.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.236
I mean, it couldn't have been

26:12.238 --> 26:14.338
More than two or three minutes
at the most.

26:14.340 --> 26:17.074
And when I came back out,
he was gone.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.176
And e wrote that note
on my laptop.
"keep quiet,

26:19.178 --> 26:21.612
Do what we ask,
and you'll get your kid back."
and I went

26:21.614 --> 26:23.614
And I confronted
him at work.
Did you get physical with him?

26:23.616 --> 26:25.249
Yeah, yeah, I admit it,
I lost my temper.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.318
I hit him,
but I didn't kill him!

26:27.320 --> 26:29.153
All right?

26:29.155 --> 26:31.121
He said he didn't know
where christopher was,

26:31.123 --> 26:33.157
And that I should just go along,

26:33.159 --> 26:36.160
And that I should just shut off
the lights in the rialto room.

26:38.163 --> 26:41.665
But I did everything they asked.

26:41.667 --> 26:44.101
Where is he?

26:44.103 --> 26:46.170
Where's my son?

26:46.172 --> 26:48.339
We're gonna
get him back for you.

26:59.184 --> 27:02.252
You know,
when I was taken...

27:02.254 --> 27:04.388
When I was being held...

27:06.358 --> 27:10.194
...At least I knew
you guys were looking for me.

27:13.164 --> 27:15.399
This little baby...

27:15.401 --> 27:17.768
What is <i>he</i> thinking?

27:17.770 --> 27:20.404
He's in a weird
place with...

27:20.406 --> 27:22.406
Without his father.

27:22.408 --> 27:26.310
Yeah... Kid cases
are always tough.

27:28.847 --> 27:30.848
Thing is...

27:30.850 --> 27:32.850
Whoever took him...

27:32.852 --> 27:35.085
They already got
what they wanted.

27:35.087 --> 27:37.187
They have no use
for him now.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.390
Morgan, do you really
want to go there?
Why not?

27:39.392 --> 27:41.358
They've already shown they
have no trouble killing.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.860
What's one more?

27:42.862 --> 27:44.294
Yeah, but this is a baby.

27:44.296 --> 27:47.398
And you just have
to hope that

27:47.400 --> 27:50.067
It's... Somehow different.

27:51.436 --> 27:53.337
(quietly):
Yeah.

27:56.941 --> 27:59.009
(crying softly)

27:59.011 --> 28:01.311
(sniffles, sobs)

28:04.182 --> 28:06.383
(sniffles, sobs)

28:07.786 --> 28:10.120
(continues sobbing)

28:10.122 --> 28:12.356
Sorry.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.191
What's wrong with me?

28:14.193 --> 28:15.759
Hey...

28:16.995 --> 28:19.296
You're only human.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.732
(quietly):
Thanks.

28:21.734 --> 28:24.401
(sniffles)

28:25.970 --> 28:27.805
Let's check outside.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.239
Father said he was
only in the shower

28:29.241 --> 28:31.275
For a few minutes;
maybe the kidnapper

28:31.277 --> 28:33.277
Was waiting there,
watching...

28:33.279 --> 28:36.380
For the perfect time to strike.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.182
We got to find this kid.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.961
Sanders:
Oh, yeah.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.296
Someone was definitely here,

28:52.298 --> 28:53.397
In this spot.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.833
You can see
his shoe impressions.

28:57.168 --> 28:59.036
Brody:
Perfect view of the hallway

28:59.038 --> 29:00.437
Towards the bathroom door.

29:00.439 --> 29:03.140
Kidnapper could have seen ryan
heading to the bathroom

29:03.142 --> 29:04.308
To take a shower.

29:06.411 --> 29:08.345
What's this?

29:11.149 --> 29:14.151
Hey, get a shot of that.

29:14.153 --> 29:15.786
(shutter clicks)

29:15.788 --> 29:17.855
Some kind of coin.
It could have

29:17.857 --> 29:20.324
Fallen out of someone's pocket,
if they were crouched down here.

29:20.326 --> 29:23.393
Sanders: Well, it's definitely
not u.S. Currency.

29:23.395 --> 29:25.429
I don't know--
how's your arabic?

29:25.431 --> 29:28.098
My arabic's crap.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.234
But my pashto's not bad.

29:30.236 --> 29:31.502
Pashto?

29:31.504 --> 29:33.370
Like afghanistan?

29:33.372 --> 29:34.905
Yeah.

29:34.907 --> 29:37.141
Well, our first victim,
the security guard,

29:37.143 --> 29:40.444
His wife said that he did
four tours in afghanistan.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.379
You're thinking
our innocent victim

29:42.381 --> 29:45.449
Wasn't so innocent after all.

29:45.451 --> 29:48.385
So, paul brantson
was far from an angel.

29:48.387 --> 29:50.988
He left the military
with a bad-conduct discharge.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.890
Apparently, he was
trying to smuggle

29:52.892 --> 29:55.125
More than a coin
out of afghanistan.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.127
I checked the security
schedule at the casino.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.396
Mm-hmm.
He wasn't even supposed
to be working last night.

29:59.398 --> 30:01.899
Really?
He traded shifts
to be in the room.

30:01.901 --> 30:04.434
So it was no accident
he was there.

30:04.436 --> 30:07.304
I just processed
the security guard's car.

30:07.306 --> 30:10.941
Fibers found in the backseat
are a match to the baby's crib.

30:10.943 --> 30:13.410
There's also traces
of zinc oxide.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.512
Diaper paste.

30:23.421 --> 30:25.589
Why won't anybody tell me
what's going on?

30:25.591 --> 30:28.892
My husband's dead,
I'm trying to plan a funeral,

30:28.894 --> 30:32.062
And your people storm
into my house and start
tearing it apart without even

30:32.064 --> 30:33.564
An explanation!
Ms. Brantson....

30:33.566 --> 30:34.965
Please...

30:34.967 --> 30:37.034
Take a seat.

30:40.572 --> 30:42.306
(sighs)

30:46.177 --> 30:48.178
Do you recognize this?

30:48.180 --> 30:51.181
It's an afghani coin.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.517
Yeah. It's paul's.

30:54.419 --> 30:57.354
He always carried it
with him to remind him

30:57.356 --> 30:59.990
Of all the guys who
weren't as lucky as he was,

30:59.992 --> 31:02.526
The guys who
didn't make it back.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.895
The problem is, we found it
outside of the house

31:04.897 --> 31:06.396
Where a young baby
was kidnapped.

31:06.398 --> 31:09.399
Well, then obviously
it's <i>not</i> paul's.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.501
It just looks like
the one he carried.

31:11.503 --> 31:13.003
Except his fingerprint
was on it.

31:13.005 --> 31:15.272
And when we
searched his car,

31:15.274 --> 31:17.374
We found evidence that a baby

31:17.376 --> 31:19.243
Had recently been
in the backseat.

31:19.245 --> 31:21.511
No, no, this is insane.

31:21.513 --> 31:24.214
There's no way paul
was part of a kidnapping.

31:24.216 --> 31:27.584
Do you know where your husband
was at 7:30 yesterday morning?

31:27.586 --> 31:30.153
You know what?

31:30.155 --> 31:32.389
I'm not doing this with you.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.424
I just lost my husband,

31:34.426 --> 31:36.493
And I haven't even
been able to bury him yet.

31:36.495 --> 31:38.929
I am very sorry for
your loss, but right now,

31:38.931 --> 31:40.564
We are focused on
finding that baby.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.366
So if you know
something,

31:42.368 --> 31:44.401
Or if there's anything
you want to tell us...
No, no.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.103
I'm not talking to you anymore.

31:46.105 --> 31:47.938
I'm not speaking
to anyone,

31:47.940 --> 31:50.140
Except <i>maybe</i> a lawyer.

31:55.413 --> 31:58.515
Russell:
Okay, we've got at least
four employees from the casino--

31:58.517 --> 32:01.318
The stunt driver, valet parker,

32:01.320 --> 32:03.553
Security guard...

32:03.555 --> 32:06.490
And the maintenance worker.

32:06.492 --> 32:10.594
These three all presumably
part of the robbery crew,

32:10.596 --> 32:13.563
All killed during
or after the heist.

32:13.565 --> 32:16.033
Well, so much
for honor among thieves.

32:16.035 --> 32:17.601
Russell:
Let me ask you something.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.636
Why not kill
the maintenance worker?

32:19.638 --> 32:21.471
Why is ryan still alive?

32:21.473 --> 32:23.040
'cause he doesn't pose a threat.

32:23.042 --> 32:25.342
He didn't even know
who the main players were,

32:25.344 --> 32:28.512
And he wasn't in for
a share of the spoils.

32:28.514 --> 32:32.015
Well, we know we have at least
one more player out there--

32:32.017 --> 32:35.519
Whoever shot julian reese
and took the money.
Good chance

32:35.521 --> 32:38.522
It's another four kings
employee, but there are
over 400 of them,

32:38.524 --> 32:41.091
So it's gonna take time
to run them down.

32:41.093 --> 32:43.327
Which we don't have--
that baby's been out there

32:43.329 --> 32:44.661
For more than 36 hours.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.697
Hey, guys, just got
a call from akers.

32:46.699 --> 32:48.465
Ryan archer is gone.

32:51.569 --> 32:52.669
Officer akers!

32:52.671 --> 32:55.005
What the hell
happened here?

32:55.007 --> 32:56.606
Captain, he was only out of
my sight for a couple of min--

32:56.608 --> 32:58.241
Why was he out of
your sight at all?

32:58.243 --> 32:59.509
H-he said he needed
to use the bathroom.

32:59.511 --> 33:01.044
I went to check on him...

33:01.046 --> 33:03.580
Damn it, akers, you had one
job to do, just one job.

33:03.582 --> 33:06.616
You were to sit on this guy,
and keep an eye on him.

33:06.618 --> 33:08.986
That's it, one job!
Jim, come on,
man, chill out.

33:08.988 --> 33:11.154
Shut up, stokes.
Don't tell me what to do.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.090
You, get out of here.

33:13.092 --> 33:14.524
Captain...

33:14.526 --> 33:15.659
They contacted him!

33:15.661 --> 33:17.160
Well, we've been
monitoring his phone.

33:17.162 --> 33:18.595
This is an e-mail.

33:18.597 --> 33:21.431
"this is your last chance.

33:21.433 --> 33:24.167
Meet at the employee
parking lot, level four."

33:25.336 --> 33:27.671
He's gonna get his kid.

33:27.673 --> 33:31.041
No, he's gonna get
himself killed.

33:41.052 --> 33:42.586
I don't see him.
I think we're too late.

33:42.588 --> 33:44.021
I don't see him, either.

33:48.359 --> 33:49.159
Nick!

33:49.161 --> 33:49.793
Ryan?

33:51.329 --> 33:53.063
What happened?

33:53.065 --> 33:54.664
I've done it. I've lost him.
I'll never see him now.

33:54.666 --> 33:56.533
All right, calm down.
Is this your blood?

33:56.535 --> 33:58.235
Are you hurt?
It's not my blood.

33:58.237 --> 34:01.304
What went off?
I was just sitting
in the car, waiting.

34:01.306 --> 34:03.140
Next thing you know, somebody
comes up to my blind spot.

34:03.142 --> 34:04.508
Suddenly, a gun was
at my head.

34:04.510 --> 34:06.410
And as I was trying
to get out, I mean,

34:06.412 --> 34:07.277
I guess the gun went off.

34:07.279 --> 34:08.211
Brody:
Nick...

34:08.213 --> 34:09.413
I got a body.

34:10.581 --> 34:12.115
It's the dealer
from the card room.

34:12.117 --> 34:13.283
No pulse.

34:13.285 --> 34:15.552
She's dead.
No, no. No.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.621
She was the one person
who knew where christopher was.

34:17.623 --> 34:18.622
Charlie-05, I got a 187.

34:18.624 --> 34:20.157
Send backup, code three.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.059
You better start
talking to me, ryan!

34:22.061 --> 34:23.727
I got keys.

34:26.431 --> 34:28.698
(car alarm beeping)

34:28.700 --> 34:30.634
Over this way.

34:30.636 --> 34:32.369
You stay with me!
Stay with me!

34:33.638 --> 34:35.605
(alarm chirps off)

34:38.342 --> 34:39.643
(crying)

34:39.645 --> 34:40.811
I got the baby.

34:40.813 --> 34:42.479
Christopher! Oh, my god.
Oh, no, no, no.

34:42.481 --> 34:44.581
Stay back, ryan.
There's no way

34:44.583 --> 34:47.451
I'm gonna let you touch him,
and you're covered in blood.
Come on. It's my son.

34:47.453 --> 34:49.453
Look, the important thing is
that he's okay, see?

34:49.455 --> 34:51.088
He's okay.
There's daddy.
Yeah, okay.

34:51.090 --> 34:52.756
We'll get him to the hospital,
we'll get you

34:52.758 --> 34:54.191
To the hospital, we'll
get him checked out.

34:54.193 --> 34:55.325
It's gonna be okay.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.694
Okay, buddy.
Daddy's right here, okay?

34:57.696 --> 34:59.763
Just get his bun-bun, all right?
Okay.

34:59.765 --> 35:02.732
It's gonna make him feel better.
Yeah, we'll do that;
we'll get his bun-bun.

35:02.734 --> 35:04.868
Come on, let's go over here.
Come on, now.

35:04.870 --> 35:07.637
You're okay.

35:07.639 --> 35:10.674
Our dead poker dealer, audrey--
just came from her house.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.742
She's got all kinds
of kids stuff.

35:12.744 --> 35:15.345
She's got toys, food,
a makeshift crib.

35:15.347 --> 35:17.681
Looks like she was gonna
keep that kid for the long haul.

35:17.683 --> 35:20.450
Also found
this disposable phone.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.719
In it was the text
signaling ryan

35:22.721 --> 35:23.820
To turn off the lights.

35:23.822 --> 35:26.156
So, she was the eyes
in the poker room.

35:26.824 --> 35:28.458
Okay...

35:28.460 --> 35:29.693
The gun we recovered

35:29.695 --> 35:32.362
Next to the dealer's dead body
belonged to her.

35:32.364 --> 35:34.464
Greg just ran
ballistics.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.266
It's the gun
that killed reese in his car.

35:36.268 --> 35:38.702
So, what are we thinking,
that she's the mastermind,

35:38.704 --> 35:40.837
The femme fatale,
the one who seduced

35:40.839 --> 35:43.240
The other three into
executing her plan?

35:43.242 --> 35:45.742
Oh, way she looked,
it wouldn't have been that hard.

35:45.744 --> 35:47.444
Is this it?

35:47.446 --> 35:49.379
Is this really

35:49.381 --> 35:51.414
The whole team?

35:52.750 --> 35:55.652
No... No, we can't.

35:55.654 --> 35:58.755
Where's the money?

35:59.857 --> 36:01.858
Hey.

36:01.860 --> 36:05.795
Oh, that's not a late-night
snack, I'm guessing.

36:05.797 --> 36:07.697
No, I just came
from the hospital.

36:07.699 --> 36:10.333
They belong to the baby that
was kidnapped and his father.

36:10.335 --> 36:11.801
We looking
for anything specific?

36:11.803 --> 36:16.806
Where the baby was and who he
might have had contact with.

36:21.913 --> 36:24.648
Oh, try to preserve that
the best you can.

36:24.650 --> 36:26.249
It's special
to the kid.
Oh.

36:26.251 --> 36:28.351
Yeah, it's funny
how babies do that,

36:28.353 --> 36:30.954
Fixate on one particular toy.

36:30.956 --> 36:33.690
When I was a baby, mine was
an elephant called "stinky."

36:33.692 --> 36:36.393
Guess I carried him around
in my mouth a lot.

36:36.395 --> 36:38.562
He was always moist.

36:38.564 --> 36:42.532
Moist means bacteria,
which leads to stinky.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.201
Henry, look at this.

36:44.203 --> 36:45.435
It looks like sweat stains,

36:45.437 --> 36:48.438
The pattern, at least,
but the color...

36:48.440 --> 36:51.274
It's orange.
Just like the tint that came
off the motorcycle leathers.

36:51.276 --> 36:53.743
It wasn't
from the tanning process.

36:53.745 --> 36:55.378
It's from the perspiration.

36:55.380 --> 36:56.713
Chromhidrosis--

36:56.715 --> 36:57.948
Colored sweat.

36:57.950 --> 36:59.783
It's a rare condition
on its own.

36:59.785 --> 37:01.851
More often, it's a side effect
of something else.

37:01.853 --> 37:03.853
Like copper miners
can sweat blue

37:03.855 --> 37:05.255
From the minerals
in the mine.

37:05.257 --> 37:06.590
What about this?
What about orange?

37:06.592 --> 37:08.892
Could be a pharmaceutical
side effect.

37:08.894 --> 37:10.961
Is this baby taking
any medication?

37:17.835 --> 37:19.869
Oh, finally.

37:19.871 --> 37:21.805
(laughs)
doctor said

37:21.807 --> 37:22.973
Everything looks good.

37:22.975 --> 37:25.675
There's nothing
to worry about.

37:25.677 --> 37:27.644
Thought I might never get
to hold him again.

37:27.646 --> 37:30.981
No one's happier than me
to see this reunion.

37:30.983 --> 37:34.551
I've been so obsessed
with the loss of my wife,

37:34.553 --> 37:36.920
I haven't focused enough on him.

37:37.888 --> 37:40.423
You did the best you could.

37:42.627 --> 37:43.960
How's your son,
mr. Archer?

37:43.962 --> 37:45.762
Seems to be doing fine.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.897
Doctors said
he checked out okay.

37:47.899 --> 37:49.866
I guess the kidnappers took
pretty good care of him then.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.501
Fed him,
changed his diaper,

37:51.503 --> 37:54.004
Gave him his medication.

37:54.006 --> 37:55.772
Your son is on rifampin, right?

37:55.774 --> 37:57.874
You both are?

37:57.876 --> 37:59.509
What's going on, sara?

37:59.511 --> 38:01.878
Well, the hospital ran blood
tests on christopher tonight,

38:01.880 --> 38:04.314
And his rifampin
level suggested he had

38:04.316 --> 38:05.949
A dose about ten hours ago.

38:05.951 --> 38:08.285
Would you like
to explain to me

38:08.287 --> 38:10.487
How the kidnappers knew
to give him his medication?

38:16.661 --> 38:18.862
Sidle:
<i>Well done, mr. Archer.</i>

38:18.864 --> 38:21.665
You played us, you played
the sympathy card with your son.

38:21.667 --> 38:24.801
You had us all believing that
you were one of the victims.

38:24.803 --> 38:27.003
Not bad.
Look, I don't
care what you say.

38:27.005 --> 38:29.406
I didn't kidnap my own son.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.941
It was that security guard,
just like you said.

38:31.943 --> 38:34.811
They took christopher to force
me to be part of their plan.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.346
That's what you
wanted us to think.

38:36.348 --> 38:38.048
But it was you

38:38.050 --> 38:40.483
Who planted the afghani coin
in your garden,

38:40.485 --> 38:43.620
And it was you who put the
diaper paste in his backseat.

38:43.622 --> 38:45.588
My god, you make me out to be

38:45.590 --> 38:46.923
Like I'm this
criminal mastermind

38:46.925 --> 38:48.525
With this crazy plan.

38:48.527 --> 38:49.859
I just did what I had to do!

38:49.861 --> 38:51.861
I turned off the lights.
That's all.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.096
Finlay:
That is not all.

38:53.098 --> 38:54.664
Not even close.

38:54.666 --> 38:57.000
This, uh, medication
you're on, rifampin,

38:57.002 --> 38:58.768
Has an interesting side effect.

38:58.770 --> 39:00.770
It's called chromhidrosis.

39:00.772 --> 39:02.605
Causes colored sweat.

39:02.607 --> 39:04.908
Your baby's sweat is orange,
your sweat is orange.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.643
Haven't you noticed?

39:06.645 --> 39:08.745
We've only been taking it
a couple days.

39:08.747 --> 39:09.846
Does it really matter?
Yeah.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.981
Yeah, it matters.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.583
That's you.

39:13.585 --> 39:15.919
You were sweating
when you robbed the card room.

39:15.921 --> 39:19.456
<i>You were sweating</i>
<i>when you shot paul brantson.</i>

39:19.458 --> 39:21.391
<i>Injecting clint tyree</i>
<i>with snake venom--</i>

39:21.393 --> 39:23.860
<i>That made you</i>
<i>sweat, too, right?</i>

39:23.862 --> 39:25.795
Finlay:
And then, after the robbery,

39:25.797 --> 39:27.864
You went
and you killed julian reese,

39:27.866 --> 39:30.900
And then you stashed
the motorcycle leathers
and the syringe

39:30.902 --> 39:32.902
In his car,
hoping that we'd think

39:32.904 --> 39:34.904
That reese was the gunman.

39:34.906 --> 39:36.539
Sidle:
There was only one problem.

39:36.541 --> 39:38.942
Those motorcycle leathers
absorbed a lot of sweat--

39:38.944 --> 39:41.578
Orange sweat--
when I compared them

39:41.580 --> 39:43.880
To the shirt that I took
from you tonight, guess what?

39:43.882 --> 39:46.049
They were a perfect match,
right down

39:46.051 --> 39:47.984
To identical traces
of rifampin.

39:47.986 --> 39:50.553
Finlay: So that puts you
in the leathers, ryan.

39:50.555 --> 39:52.088
You're our guy.

39:52.090 --> 39:56.126
You robbed the rialto room,
and you killed four people.

40:01.098 --> 40:03.099
I didn't do it for me.

40:03.101 --> 40:05.068
Sidle:
Oh, let me guess.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.504
This is the part where you argue
for father of the year.

40:07.506 --> 40:10.106
Chris was five months old
when my wife died.

40:10.108 --> 40:11.541
Do you have any idea

40:11.543 --> 40:13.576
The amount of medical bills
she left behind?

40:13.578 --> 40:15.612
So, you killed four people
to pay them?

40:15.614 --> 40:17.981
So much money
goes through that place.

40:17.983 --> 40:19.649
I mean, just a handful

40:19.651 --> 40:22.519
Of chips would have changed
everything for me and chris.

40:23.687 --> 40:27.590
I mean, just think how
I could have raised him.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.993
Yeah, how are you going
to raise him now?

40:29.995 --> 40:32.095
(crying)

40:32.097 --> 40:34.030
(sighs)

40:38.102 --> 40:41.070
Hey, man.
Hey, you got a second?

40:41.072 --> 40:43.106
Yeah, sure. What's up?

40:43.108 --> 40:44.674
(sighs)

40:44.676 --> 40:46.609
I owe you an apology.

40:46.611 --> 40:48.912
(chuckles)
for what?

40:48.914 --> 40:51.114
For jumping on you
and jumping on akers.

40:51.116 --> 40:53.783
I talked to akers, and now I'm
talking to you-- I'm sorry.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.785
Jim, I get it.

40:55.787 --> 40:58.121
You got a lot going on
right now, okay?

40:58.123 --> 41:00.123
Yeah, I got a lot
going on, yeah.

41:00.125 --> 41:02.225
The d.A.'s calling me.

41:02.227 --> 41:06.062
The prosecutor wants to talk
to me about testifying against

41:06.064 --> 41:07.030
My daughter.

41:07.032 --> 41:08.798
Yeah, I mean,
I'm on the phone

41:08.800 --> 41:10.700
Six or seven times
a day to new jersey,

41:10.702 --> 41:13.036
Handling my
ex-wife's affairs.

41:13.038 --> 41:16.606
Come on, everything will be back
to normal eventually.

41:16.608 --> 41:18.074
You know that.

41:18.076 --> 41:20.743
Back to normal--
I'd like that.

41:22.079 --> 41:25.181
But I'll tell you, nick, the way
my life's going right now,

41:25.183 --> 41:27.851
I don't know what normal is.

41:30.588 --> 41:33.056
(footsteps approaching)

41:33.058 --> 41:35.258
Hey.

41:35.260 --> 41:37.594
Hey.

41:37.596 --> 41:38.995
Just got
off the phone with greg.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.530
They found the money

41:40.532 --> 41:43.900
In a maintenance locker
at the casino.

41:43.902 --> 41:45.635
Good.

41:45.637 --> 41:47.704
Sit down.

41:53.978 --> 41:56.946
I just wish
we could take the money,

41:56.948 --> 41:59.549
You know, put it in a trust
for that poor kid.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.652
That'd be nice.

42:05.189 --> 42:08.558
Well, kids are resilient.

42:08.560 --> 42:11.227
Maybe he'll be all right.

42:11.229 --> 42:14.864
What about you?

42:14.866 --> 42:16.733
You gonna be all right?

42:20.571 --> 42:23.206
Time heals all, right?

42:25.242 --> 42:29.112
I guess we'll find out

42:32.783 --> 42:34.951
Have a good night.

42:34.953 --> 42:34.984
You, too.
