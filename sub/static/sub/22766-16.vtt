WEBVTT

00:08.632 --> 00:10.991
Mornin' sunshine!

00:11.592 --> 00:13.270
Ehi.

00:13.476 --> 00:15.143
Look like you could use an aspirin.

00:15.168 --> 00:17.898
What time did you make it
home from Molly's last night?

00:18.725 --> 00:20.718
- I didn't.
- Oh.

00:20.743 --> 00:23.420
Walk of shame? I mean, I've been there.

00:23.445 --> 00:25.154
Dr. Rhodes, I need you.

00:25.179 --> 00:26.397
I'm not on Trauma today, Maggie.

00:26.422 --> 00:28.411
Not a Trauma. Robert Haywood, Dr.
Reese's dad,

00:28.436 --> 00:30.270
CFD just arrived with a STEMI alert.

00:30.295 --> 00:31.489
Yeah.

00:33.468 --> 00:35.592
Courtney, you're going to T Two.

00:35.617 --> 00:37.157
Robert Haywood, 58-year-old male

00:37.182 --> 00:39.303
with known history of heart
failure, CAD, and...

00:39.328 --> 00:41.461
Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Yeah, he's my patient.

00:41.486 --> 00:44.071
Heart rate, 95. BP, 88 over 44.

00:44.096 --> 00:45.646
New onset angina unrelieved

00:45.671 --> 00:47.331
with nitro and aspirin in the field.

00:47.356 --> 00:49.960
EKG shows ST elevations.

00:50.309 --> 00:51.888
It feels like someone's squeezing.

00:51.913 --> 00:53.434
I know, Bob, you're
having a heart attack.

00:53.459 --> 00:54.781
Just try to stay calm, okay?

00:54.806 --> 00:56.068
All right, everybody, on my count.

00:56.093 --> 00:59.421
One, two, three. There we go.

01:01.214 --> 01:02.689
Maggie, you paged.

01:02.714 --> 01:04.995
It's your dad.

01:05.021 --> 01:07.578
- The ambo just brought him in.
- What?

01:09.437 --> 01:11.530
Irregular heartbeat. He's in a-fib.

01:11.555 --> 01:13.366
Four of morphine,

01:13.391 --> 01:15.136
esmolol drip, and an aspirin.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.703
Rapid ventricular rate, 210.

01:16.728 --> 01:19.095
He's in SVT and hypotensive.
We need to cardiovert.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.976
Give me the paddles.

01:22.001 --> 01:23.853
All right, 5 of valium.

01:23.878 --> 01:25.891
- Charge to 75 joules.
- Charged.

01:25.916 --> 01:27.637
Sync and clear.

01:30.579 --> 01:32.558
Back to sinus rhythm. Rate, 88.

01:32.583 --> 01:34.017
All right, Maggie, call the cath lab.

01:34.042 --> 01:36.586
- Tell 'em we're on our way up.
- I got you.

01:36.611 --> 01:38.079
- Ready?
- Wait.

01:38.104 --> 01:40.234
All right. Let's go.

01:43.357 --> 01:45.107
Come on, Sarah, you
can ride up with us.

01:47.051 --> 01:48.516
Sarah?

01:51.098 --> 01:56.961
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:57.211 --> 01:59.503
We stented your right coronary artery,

01:59.528 --> 02:01.521
and we placed a balloon pump.

02:01.546 --> 02:03.855
Now, your ejection fraction is low,

02:03.880 --> 02:06.037
so I'm afraid that you're gonna
have to stay in the ICU...

02:06.062 --> 02:07.663
Until a heart becomes available.

02:07.688 --> 02:08.955
Mm-hmm.

02:08.979 --> 02:10.913
It's just as I predicted.

02:11.208 --> 02:14.627
Though, I'll admit, I didn't
expect to end up here so soon.

02:14.652 --> 02:17.563
You are at the highest status
on the transplant list.

02:17.588 --> 02:19.483
But only for 30 days.

02:19.898 --> 02:21.793
If I don't get a heart by then...

02:24.537 --> 02:27.667
Ah, we'll... we'll cross that
bridge when we get there?

02:27.692 --> 02:29.559
Took the words right
out of my mouth, Bob.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.166
I'll see you soon, all right?
All right.

02:31.191 --> 02:32.592
Oh, Dr. Rhodes,

02:32.686 --> 02:35.890
do you know if, uh, Sarah's here today?

02:37.234 --> 02:39.399
Uh, I'm not sure about that,

02:39.424 --> 02:41.293
but I can check on it for you.

02:47.283 --> 02:50.252
Hey. I heard about your dad.

02:50.286 --> 02:52.654
I'm sorry. If you need to talk or...

02:52.689 --> 02:54.356
I don't.

02:54.381 --> 02:56.071
But thanks.

02:58.461 --> 03:00.786
Dr. Sexton, heads up.

03:00.811 --> 03:03.186
- This is Henry Lee.
- How are you doing, Mr. Lee?

03:03.211 --> 03:04.336
You're going to Treatment Two.

03:04.361 --> 03:06.404
Congestive heart failure
and metastatic stage four

03:06.429 --> 03:08.230
non-small-cell lung cancer.

03:08.502 --> 03:10.393
Stopped chemo last month.

03:10.418 --> 03:12.490
All right, Mr. Lee.

03:16.089 --> 03:17.934
Hey, Henry.

03:18.371 --> 03:20.009
There's my girl.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.203
You two know each other?

03:21.228 --> 03:22.934
Old friends.

03:22.959 --> 03:24.895
Henry used to come into
the ED once a month

03:24.920 --> 03:26.587
for his heart meds.

03:26.777 --> 03:28.685
Been missing you around here, man.

03:28.710 --> 03:30.344
Okay, where does it hurt, Mr. Lee?

03:30.464 --> 03:32.911
Faster to tell you
where it doesn't hurt.

03:32.936 --> 03:34.824
Give 5 of morphine IV.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:43.247 --> 03:44.692
Bibasilar crackles.

03:44.717 --> 03:47.318
Add 20 of Lasix and
order a chest X-ray.

03:47.423 --> 03:49.865
Henry has a history of
malignant pleural effusions.

03:49.890 --> 03:51.796
Every time they drain my lungs,

03:51.821 --> 03:53.703
suckers just heal right back up.

03:53.728 --> 03:55.385
Okay, well, we can put
in a drainage tube.

03:55.410 --> 03:58.411
No, no, no more procedures.

03:58.436 --> 04:00.170
No needles, no tubes.

04:00.332 --> 04:01.921
I'm done with all that.

04:02.213 --> 04:03.809
Yes, sir.

04:13.813 --> 04:15.347
Henry's cancer's everywhere.

04:15.372 --> 04:17.523
Hey, does he have any family?

04:17.555 --> 04:19.757
Not that I know of.
His wife is deceased.

04:19.781 --> 04:21.475
I'm pretty sure he lives alone.

04:21.599 --> 04:23.266
Okay, well, we'll have to transfer him

04:23.291 --> 04:25.026
to a hospice facility.

04:25.493 --> 04:27.213
I'm sorry, April.

04:34.356 --> 04:35.940
Choi, Halstead, walk with me.

04:35.965 --> 04:37.618
CFD's inbound with two teenage boys

04:37.643 --> 04:39.007
burned in a house fire,

04:39.032 --> 04:41.062
one of which is Carter
Singleton the Third.

04:41.087 --> 04:41.828
Singleton?

04:41.853 --> 04:43.515
Yes, as in the soon-to-be-constructed

04:43.540 --> 04:46.247
Singleton Center for
Diagnostic Radiology.

04:46.272 --> 04:48.775
Huge donors, and
Goodwin's godson, so...

04:48.800 --> 04:50.674
- VIP. Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:50.699 --> 04:53.001
You're going to Treatment Six. Desmond?

04:53.026 --> 04:55.893
16-year-old male, 22%
second-degree burns.

04:55.918 --> 04:58.790
BP, 120 over 82. Heart rate, 110.

04:58.815 --> 05:00.655
- A friend's right behind.
- Bo? Where's Bo?

05:00.680 --> 05:02.476
Bo Williams, 17 years old.

05:02.501 --> 05:04.130
85% third degree burns.

05:04.155 --> 05:06.932
Couldn't get a BP, but
palpable radial pulse of 112.

05:06.957 --> 05:08.677
Kids a real hero. When we got there,

05:08.702 --> 05:10.371
he was giving his buddy
CPR on the lawn.

05:10.396 --> 05:13.222
Okay, gently, one, two, three.

05:14.821 --> 05:16.335
- 100 of fentanyl for the pain.
- Yes.

05:16.360 --> 05:19.129
- Thank you, Desmond.
- Yep.

05:24.229 --> 05:26.576
All right, lungs are clear.

05:26.945 --> 05:28.675
Where'd you learn to do CPR?

05:28.700 --> 05:30.377
- Boy Scouts.
- Carter, I'm here.

05:30.402 --> 05:31.399
Is Bo gonna be okay?

05:31.424 --> 05:33.421
He's with Dr. Choi, one of the best.

05:33.446 --> 05:35.345
He's taking very good care of him.

05:41.216 --> 05:42.671
Groin line's in.

05:42.696 --> 05:43.953
I'm having trouble bagging him.

05:43.978 --> 05:46.278
- His chest is cooked.
- He needs a chest escharotomy.

05:46.303 --> 05:48.066
- Scalpel?
- You're gonna do it here?

05:48.091 --> 05:49.782
No choice. His chest can't expand.

05:49.807 --> 05:51.524
Gotta release the skin tension.

05:54.873 --> 05:56.443
Ms. Goodwin?

05:56.468 --> 05:58.748
Oh, my God, Carter!

05:58.773 --> 06:00.242
Lydia, careful.

06:00.267 --> 06:02.630
Sharon, is he gonna be okay?

06:03.022 --> 06:05.097
Carter suffered second-degree burns.

06:05.122 --> 06:06.925
They're gonna be painful
to the touch for a while.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.930
Dr. Halstead, Lydia and
Maurice Singleton.

06:10.554 --> 06:12.692
Son, uh, how... How did this happen?

06:12.717 --> 06:14.536
Is Bo all right?

06:14.824 --> 06:16.729
Were you with Bo?

06:17.650 --> 06:19.555
That boy is nothing but trouble.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.711
That's not true, Mom.

06:20.736 --> 06:22.996
You know you are not allowed
to go over to his house.

06:23.021 --> 06:27.118
Lydia, just lighten up
a little bit, please.

06:27.743 --> 06:30.021
Uh, Maria, wash the burns
with soap and water,

06:30.046 --> 06:32.386
apply Silvadene cream, and I'll
be back to help dress him.

06:32.411 --> 06:34.156
Thank you, Dr. Halstead.

06:34.181 --> 06:36.201
Here, please.

06:38.995 --> 06:40.741
That kid's in pretty bad shape.

06:40.766 --> 06:42.324
Have you notified his parents?

06:42.349 --> 06:44.352
They were visiting some
friends over in Lake Geneva.

06:44.377 --> 06:45.940
Driving back now.

06:45.965 --> 06:47.710
That's terrible news to come home to.

06:47.735 --> 06:49.147
Yeah.

06:49.570 --> 06:51.075
All right.

06:53.626 --> 06:56.029
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:56.973 --> 06:59.634
So, sidelined for the
conjoined twins surgery,

06:59.659 --> 07:02.545
and now you're doing procedures
before your morning coffee?

07:02.570 --> 07:05.371
- I like the fight in you.
- I'm a glutton for punishment.

07:05.396 --> 07:07.531
Latham made his choice clear.

07:07.556 --> 07:09.732
You know, it's not over
until the first incision.

07:09.757 --> 07:11.872
Start playing nice, maybe
you'll be holding the scalpel.

07:11.897 --> 07:13.343
Are you all of a sudden
rooting for my success?

07:13.368 --> 07:15.634
Not at all, I just hate
winning by default.

07:20.764 --> 07:22.236
Bruce Hammond, 34.

07:22.261 --> 07:23.361
Blunt trauma to the chest

07:23.386 --> 07:25.087
following a high-speed car accident.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.219
Negative echo, but a
small left hemothorax

07:27.244 --> 07:28.797
and a sternal fracture.

07:28.822 --> 07:30.826
CT's negative for aortic injury.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.552
Yes, but Radiology read
that there might be

07:32.577 --> 07:34.213
a small pericardial effusion.

07:34.238 --> 07:36.822
Since he's got a hemothorax,
let's put a chest tube in

07:36.847 --> 07:38.644
and see what comes out,

07:38.669 --> 07:40.023
and if he needs surgery,

07:40.048 --> 07:42.138
we can do a high left thoracotomy.

07:42.163 --> 07:43.716
Hold on.

07:44.469 --> 07:47.543
Is that a blush of contrast
over the right atrium?

07:47.752 --> 07:50.445
If there's a hole in his heart,
he needs a median sternotomy.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.305
Good eye, Dr. Bekker.

07:52.330 --> 07:54.431
If it is a blush, we can't
afford to ignore it.

07:54.456 --> 07:56.791
I don't know, opening him
up is highly aggressive,

07:56.816 --> 07:58.340
and we don't know whether the contrast

07:58.365 --> 08:00.827
is inside or outside of his heart.

08:01.733 --> 08:05.910
If the majority is in
favor of sternotomy...

08:07.135 --> 08:08.869
- I'll follow.
- Excellent.

08:08.894 --> 08:11.490
Dr. Bekker, you'll lead. Dr.
Rhodes, you'll assist.

08:11.515 --> 08:13.016
Mm-hmm.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.773
Oh, don't look so pained.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.153
I think you just earned
yourself some good will.

08:23.218 --> 08:24.774
When did Emma's pain start?

08:24.799 --> 08:27.593
About an hour ago, halfway
through ballet class.

08:27.618 --> 08:29.055
I wasn't sure if I should bring her in,

08:29.080 --> 08:31.311
but her mom would have my head
if something happened to her.

08:32.433 --> 08:35.047
I was worried that it
might be appendicitis.

08:35.072 --> 08:37.280
No, appendicitis would be
pain on her right side,

08:37.304 --> 08:39.244
but I would like to get an ultrasound.

08:39.618 --> 08:42.053
You know, when I was young,
I wanted to take ballet,

08:42.078 --> 08:44.594
but unfortunately, I was
born with two left feet,

08:44.619 --> 08:46.996
so I went with violin instead.

08:47.021 --> 08:49.867
Well, I don't really like dance,

08:49.892 --> 08:52.181
but my mommy did ballet
when she was young,

08:52.206 --> 08:53.877
so she makes me go.

08:53.902 --> 08:55.187
Oh.

08:55.212 --> 08:56.398
Right now, I'm gonna put
this on your stomach,

08:56.423 --> 08:58.324
so I can see what's inside, okay?

08:58.349 --> 09:00.183
All right.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.051
Monique, can you increase the depth?

09:10.076 --> 09:11.830
I can't see her uterus and ovaries.

09:11.855 --> 09:14.322
It's already all the way up, Dr.
Manning.

09:20.695 --> 09:22.269
All right, let's start a line.

09:22.294 --> 09:23.789
Give her 1 milligram of
morphine for the pain.

09:23.814 --> 09:25.330
And let me know as soon
as her mom gets here.

09:25.355 --> 09:27.588
I'd like to speak with her.

09:28.692 --> 09:30.387
Is Emma gonna be okay?

09:30.412 --> 09:33.180
Yes, but it's a good thing
that you brought her in.

09:33.303 --> 09:35.344
All right, Emma, I'm gonna
be back soon, okay?

09:35.369 --> 09:37.378
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:37.403 --> 09:39.137
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

09:43.170 --> 09:45.552
Hey, Dr. Charles, you got a sec?

09:45.577 --> 09:47.711
I've got a case I'd like to run by you.

09:47.736 --> 09:49.952
- What you got?
- My patient, Emma, nine,

09:49.977 --> 09:52.045
she presented with abdominal
pain on the left side,

09:52.070 --> 09:54.328
so I did a quick bedside
scan to check her ovaries.

09:54.353 --> 09:56.765
It's actually testicular torsion.

09:56.790 --> 09:58.456
- Testicular torsion?
- Yes.

09:58.481 --> 10:00.980
The ultrasound showed an
absence of uterus and ovaries,

10:01.005 --> 10:04.172
- but she has undescended testes.
- Huh.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.896
Nothing about this in her chart?

10:05.921 --> 10:07.926
No, I doubt the family has any idea.

10:07.951 --> 10:11.242
Okay... page Pediatric Urology.

10:11.267 --> 10:14.274
- We need to get a plan together.
- Okay, thank you.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.421
I suspect Emma has
17-beta HSD3 deficiency.

10:24.446 --> 10:26.413
It's caused by a genetic mutation.

10:26.448 --> 10:27.696
Emma's testes aren't able to carry out

10:27.721 --> 10:29.793
the final step of
testosterone synthesis.

10:29.818 --> 10:32.786
So, just to be clear,
genetically, she's male?

10:32.821 --> 10:35.189
She almost certainly has
XY chromosomes, yes.

10:35.223 --> 10:37.850
As far as the testicular
torsion, what's required?

10:37.875 --> 10:39.390
We need to untwist the testis

10:39.415 --> 10:41.080
and then fixate it via orchiopexy.

10:41.105 --> 10:43.106
So we'll be able to save the testicle?

10:43.131 --> 10:44.205
With surgery, yes,

10:44.230 --> 10:45.619
otherwise it'll die
from lack of blood flow

10:45.644 --> 10:47.620
in six, maybe eight hours tops.

10:47.645 --> 10:49.211
Okay, thank you, Dr. Rios.

10:49.236 --> 10:50.695
We'll share the news with her mother

10:50.720 --> 10:52.800
and get surgical consent.

10:53.896 --> 10:56.982
This news could change Emma's
whole sense of identity.

10:57.007 --> 10:59.211
It is a lot for this family to process.

10:59.236 --> 11:00.867
You know, my experience
in situations like this

11:00.892 --> 11:02.994
is that the children are often

11:03.019 --> 11:05.887
surprisingly open-minded and resilient.

11:11.391 --> 11:12.992
What's the story?

11:13.017 --> 11:16.538
Well, Carter said that
Bo was cooking up BHL.

11:16.747 --> 11:18.481
Uh, butane hash oil.

11:18.506 --> 11:20.083
You blast marijuana with enough butane,

11:20.108 --> 11:21.689
and you get pure THC.

11:21.714 --> 11:23.515
Lengths kids will go to
to get high these days.

11:23.540 --> 11:24.686
Exactly.

11:24.711 --> 11:26.490
Uh, Carter said he heard
screams from the other room,

11:26.515 --> 11:29.067
so he ran in, he tried to
pat out the flames on Bo.

11:29.092 --> 11:30.762
Then his sweatshirt caught fire,

11:30.787 --> 11:31.938
but he dropped and rolled.

11:31.963 --> 11:34.163
Guessing from Bo's burns,
he didn't do the same.

11:34.277 --> 11:36.656
Yeah, Carter said Bo panicked and ran.

11:37.100 --> 11:38.452
Can I talk to him?

11:38.477 --> 11:40.439
He's nonresponsive and on a ventilator,

11:40.464 --> 11:42.098
but I'll you know.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.841
Hey, Will.

11:46.567 --> 11:48.468
Dr. Frisch.

11:48.511 --> 11:51.201
I think after last night,
you can call me Maia.

11:52.678 --> 11:54.615
Lunch? I'm buying.

11:54.828 --> 11:56.796
Uh, pretty slammed today.

11:56.821 --> 11:58.600
Another time.

12:01.499 --> 12:04.408
I take it you and Nat
are on the outs still?

12:05.039 --> 12:06.895
As far as I know.

12:06.930 --> 12:09.932
Careful. She'll come around.

12:14.571 --> 12:16.739
Mr. Lee, this stage in
your life can bring

12:16.773 --> 12:20.083
a lot of painful emotions
and memories up.

12:20.213 --> 12:22.648
I can help to talk about
what you're feeling,

12:22.746 --> 12:25.113
any concerns you're having,

12:25.352 --> 12:27.386
fears, regrets.

12:31.576 --> 12:33.977
Henry, what is it? What's wrong?

12:37.520 --> 12:39.444
Where's my shirt?

12:57.747 --> 12:59.915
My boy...

12:59.949 --> 13:01.517
Jackson.

13:01.551 --> 13:03.552
You have a son?

13:04.888 --> 13:06.889
When he was little,

13:06.923 --> 13:09.962
he was my shadow...

13:10.493 --> 13:14.596
but as he got older, we
started butting heads.

13:14.631 --> 13:18.309
Didn't care too much for all my rules.

13:18.777 --> 13:21.813
Rough neighborhood where we lived.

13:22.220 --> 13:24.470
Sounds like you were just
trying to protect him.

13:24.495 --> 13:26.787
But maybe I was too hard on him.

13:31.286 --> 13:34.787
His mom passed about ten years ago.

13:35.217 --> 13:38.986
After the funeral, we had words.

13:39.933 --> 13:43.748
Said some ugly things to each other.

13:44.076 --> 13:46.744
Haven't spoken since.

13:47.201 --> 13:50.331
Do you have his phone number?
Any idea where he lives?

13:50.356 --> 13:52.057
Last I heard,

13:52.082 --> 13:54.959
he was up in Wilmette...

13:55.591 --> 13:57.726
or maybe Skokie?

13:58.098 --> 13:59.808
Can't remember.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.978
Should've reached out sooner.

14:05.003 --> 14:07.805
It's not too late. We'll find him.

14:07.830 --> 14:11.133
We will do our best, Mr. Lee.

14:21.336 --> 14:23.701
Don't you think you're overpromising?

14:23.933 --> 14:26.763
How do you know we'll be
able to track this guy down?

14:27.437 --> 14:29.555
I'm not letting Henry die alone.

14:35.310 --> 14:37.506
Ruptured atrial appendage.

14:38.421 --> 14:40.523
Median sternotomy was the right call.

14:41.386 --> 14:43.992
Ah, it was a coin toss.
Could've gone the other way.

14:44.017 --> 14:46.140
Still, pulling someone through

14:46.165 --> 14:49.058
that kind of blunt
trauma, it's impressive.

14:49.083 --> 14:50.550
You should write it up.

14:50.575 --> 14:52.566
I know I said play nice,
but don't go soft on me.

14:52.591 --> 14:54.868
- That's no fun.
- Hold on...

14:55.409 --> 14:58.212
There are only 244 instruments here.

14:58.237 --> 15:00.172
There are supposed to be 245.

15:00.197 --> 15:03.042
Dr. Rhodes, stop closing.
Everyone search your areas.

15:03.067 --> 15:04.548
Check your trays, the drape pockets,

15:04.573 --> 15:07.055
- look in the basins, everywhere.
- It has to be here somewhere.

15:09.016 --> 15:11.036
Somebody talk to me, anybody!

15:11.061 --> 15:13.596
We counted three times already.

15:16.225 --> 15:18.164
Instrument's in the chest.

15:21.865 --> 15:24.194
Get a tech in here to
get a chest X-ray,

15:24.219 --> 15:26.422
and page Dr. Latham now!

15:26.697 --> 15:28.331
I don't understand.

15:28.356 --> 15:30.770
How could her doctors have
missed this for so long?

15:30.795 --> 15:33.247
Why don't we go somewhere more private?

15:33.272 --> 15:35.105
Your daughter is in
excellent hands, trust me.

15:35.130 --> 15:37.073
Here, right this way.

15:37.733 --> 15:40.338
So, because Emma's genitals
are typically female,

15:40.363 --> 15:43.101
there was no reason to suspect
that she had the condition.

15:43.126 --> 15:44.797
If the testicular torsion

15:44.822 --> 15:46.389
hadn't caused Emma's pain today,

15:46.414 --> 15:48.508
it's very likely she
wouldn't have been diagnosed

15:48.533 --> 15:49.807
until she reached puberty.

15:49.832 --> 15:51.189
What happens during puberty?

15:51.214 --> 15:52.895
When Emma turns 12 or 13,

15:52.920 --> 15:55.521
uh, the testes will start
to make testosterone.

15:55.546 --> 15:58.059
She may develop typically
male attributes:

15:58.084 --> 16:00.685
um, body and facial
hair, an Adam's apple,

16:00.710 --> 16:02.577
- her voice may deepen.
- What?

16:02.602 --> 16:05.183
No, that can't happen. You
have to take them out.

16:05.208 --> 16:07.591
The only thing that is
medically necessary right now

16:07.616 --> 16:10.612
is to alleviate Emma's pain
by untwisting the testis.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.154
But Emma would have to have

16:12.179 --> 16:13.575
another surgery down the line, right?

16:13.600 --> 16:15.126
I mean, she'd have to
have them taken out.

16:15.151 --> 16:16.060
She's a girl.

16:16.085 --> 16:17.818
Children with Emma's condition

16:17.843 --> 16:20.460
often identify as male after puberty.

16:20.485 --> 16:23.577
No, that's not... That's
not gonna happen.

16:23.995 --> 16:25.665
I want you to take them out.

16:25.690 --> 16:28.608
To perform an irreversible
procedure of this nature,

16:28.633 --> 16:31.160
we would need to inform
Emma and get her assent.

16:31.185 --> 16:33.145
Her assent? She's nine.

16:33.170 --> 16:34.762
She won't understand,
and even if she does,

16:34.787 --> 16:37.044
- it'll traumatize her.
- We fully appreciate

16:37.069 --> 16:39.067
how completely overwhelming
this is right now.

16:39.092 --> 16:40.417
Really, we do.

16:40.442 --> 16:41.909
But the truth is is that
the evolving thinking

16:41.934 --> 16:43.577
among medical ethicists

16:43.602 --> 16:46.082
is that children should be
afforded gender autonomy,

16:46.107 --> 16:47.875
regardless of their age.

16:48.033 --> 16:50.501
You know what, I just wanna be
with my daughter right now.

16:50.778 --> 16:52.479
Of course.

16:59.271 --> 17:02.072
- What the hell is that?
- No idea.

17:02.097 --> 17:03.862
Not an instrument I recognize.

17:03.887 --> 17:04.976
But it is a foreign body,

17:05.001 --> 17:06.636
and we can't pinpoint where it is.

17:06.661 --> 17:09.002
It could be in the pleural
cavity, the pericardium.

17:09.027 --> 17:10.862
We're going to have to
reopen the sternotomy.

17:10.887 --> 17:12.410
Clearly.

17:12.435 --> 17:14.897
How could a careless
oversight like this occur?

17:14.923 --> 17:16.107
We use the same instruments,

17:16.132 --> 17:17.766
the same routine every single time.

17:17.790 --> 17:19.394
How could both of you miss it?

17:20.096 --> 17:22.476
Is... is the patient's
skin fully closed?

17:22.500 --> 17:24.529
No. A few staples away.

17:24.554 --> 17:25.977
If the skin isn't closed,

17:26.002 --> 17:28.193
then the incident isn't
a sentinel event.

17:28.218 --> 17:30.611
Going back in won't be
considered a second operation.

17:30.636 --> 17:33.463
You both narrowly escaped an
investigation by the hospital

17:33.488 --> 17:35.135
and a report to IDPH.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.355
I want you in my office

17:36.380 --> 17:38.691
as soon as you retrieve
the foreign body,

17:38.716 --> 17:41.036
and I wanna know who's responsible.

17:45.795 --> 17:48.838
Don't beat yourself up. It's
only your second strike.

17:49.132 --> 17:50.620
You know this could just as easily be

17:50.645 --> 17:52.943
your instrument, right?

17:53.470 --> 17:55.746
Lucky it's an easy fix.

18:01.017 --> 18:03.123
You better not have
been smoking with Bo.

18:03.148 --> 18:04.916
I wasn't, Mom. I told you already.

18:06.819 --> 18:09.734
Bo almost ended up in juvie last year,

18:09.759 --> 18:11.691
but the judge agreed to
give him another shot.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.417
Now, you would've thought he
would've learned his lesson...

18:13.442 --> 18:14.816
Mom, just shut up, okay?

18:14.841 --> 18:16.441
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- Excuse me?

18:16.466 --> 18:17.432
Don't talk to your mother like that.

18:17.457 --> 18:18.698
What is with you?

18:20.037 --> 18:21.648
What's going on?

18:23.836 --> 18:25.965
- Sats are dropping.
- What's wrong with Bo?

18:25.990 --> 18:27.962
Take him off the vent
and start bagging.

18:27.987 --> 18:29.933
He's bradying down. Heart rate's 30.

18:29.958 --> 18:31.202
Milligram of Epi.

18:32.970 --> 18:35.512
- No pulse. PEA.
- Another milligram of Epi.

18:43.536 --> 18:46.535
Asystole. He's gone.

18:53.412 --> 18:54.879
No.

18:57.819 --> 19:00.120
No! No! No!

19:00.145 --> 19:02.208
- Son...
- Bo, please!

19:02.237 --> 19:03.709
- Carter...
- Carter... Carter...

19:03.734 --> 19:05.735
- No, just go save him, please!
- Sweetie...

19:05.771 --> 19:08.077
Please, Bo, come on, man!

19:08.102 --> 19:09.415
- Bo!
- Carter...

19:09.440 --> 19:11.474
Bo, come on, man!

19:21.656 --> 19:24.443
- That poor family.
- Yeah.

19:25.286 --> 19:26.702
It's strange.

19:26.727 --> 19:29.269
Bo's parents said he'd
been doing so well.

19:29.294 --> 19:30.873
They'd been regularly drug-testing him.

19:30.898 --> 19:33.065
He'd been clean for months.

19:33.090 --> 19:34.925
Guess he just fell off the wagon.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.287
Did you get a tox screen on Bo?

19:37.470 --> 19:39.104
No, why?

19:39.224 --> 19:42.242
Do me a favor and get one.
I'm gonna get one on Carter.

19:43.670 --> 19:45.673
Jackson Lee.

19:46.523 --> 19:49.742
No? Okay. All right, thank you, bye.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.228
Hey, any news?

19:52.253 --> 19:53.794
Not yet.

19:53.819 --> 19:55.653
I think I found his
Linkedln profile, though.

19:55.678 --> 19:56.809
Just trying to track down

19:56.834 --> 19:58.468
a phone number or an email address.

19:58.976 --> 20:01.111
I have a friend over at the DMV.

20:01.354 --> 20:02.662
Send me what you have on Jackson.

20:02.687 --> 20:04.325
- I'll see what he can do.
- Thanks, Maggie.

20:04.350 --> 20:06.237
- Yeah.
- Need some help in here.

20:06.429 --> 20:08.664
Okay.

20:09.285 --> 20:12.312
Sats down to 90. CO2's
at 65 on the ABG.

20:12.337 --> 20:15.524
Okay, Mr. Lee, you have DNI
and DNR orders on your chart.

20:15.549 --> 20:18.658
Now, I need to confirm that you
do not want us to intubate you

20:18.683 --> 20:20.850
or perform CPR should your heart stop.

20:29.794 --> 20:32.199
Okay. Then we're gonna
make you feel comfortable.

20:32.224 --> 20:34.339
Start a morphine drip
and give 4 of Ativan.

20:50.455 --> 20:52.010
Okay.

21:01.086 --> 21:03.328
No holes in the right pleura.

21:03.694 --> 21:05.358
Or the left.

21:05.868 --> 21:07.869
It must be in the pericardium.

21:07.894 --> 21:09.675
Give me more suction.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.840
Instrument's not there.

21:18.117 --> 21:20.233
It's in the heart.

21:20.718 --> 21:22.803
We're going to have to
reopen the atriotomy.

21:22.828 --> 21:25.185
That's going to require
putting him back on bypass.

21:25.210 --> 21:27.229
You're increasing his risk
of air embolism and stroke.

21:27.254 --> 21:29.790
We're aware, Marty, but
we don't have a choice.

21:30.067 --> 21:33.002
Your quick fix just got
a lot more complicated.

21:35.671 --> 21:37.536
Hi.

21:37.918 --> 21:39.519
You feeling better, Emma?

21:39.544 --> 21:41.674
My mommy says I'll need an operation.

21:41.699 --> 21:43.896
Yes, that's what my friend, Dr.
Charles, and I

21:43.920 --> 21:46.210
- came to talk to you about.
- Hi, Emma.

21:46.397 --> 21:47.897
So, you remember when I took a picture

21:47.922 --> 21:49.454
of your belly earlier?

21:49.479 --> 21:52.101
Well, it showed me that you
have something inside of you.

21:52.126 --> 21:54.427
Something that only boys
have, honey, not girls.

21:54.452 --> 21:56.256
That part inside of you,

21:56.281 --> 21:57.869
it may cause you to change a little

21:57.894 --> 21:59.203
on the outside in a few years.

21:59.228 --> 22:01.494
It'll make you look like a boy.

22:01.910 --> 22:04.891
Ms. Paulson, would you mind
giving us a moment to explain?

22:04.916 --> 22:06.509
Please?

22:06.534 --> 22:07.968
So, Emma...

22:08.073 --> 22:11.096
most people who look like
girls on the outside

22:11.121 --> 22:12.951
feel like girls on the inside,

22:13.008 --> 22:14.072
but sometimes,

22:14.097 --> 22:16.152
a person who looks like
a girl on the outside

22:16.239 --> 22:18.778
feels like a boy on the
inside, and you know what...

22:18.803 --> 22:21.248
O... okay, stop, stop, you...
You're just confusing her.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.554
Of course Emma feels like a girl.

22:23.997 --> 22:26.632
Sweetie, the part inside of you,

22:26.657 --> 22:28.476
it's what's hurting you right now,

22:28.501 --> 22:30.286
so Mommy wants the
doctors to take it out

22:30.311 --> 22:31.694
so that you'll be safe.

22:31.719 --> 22:33.672
- Mrs. Paulson...
- Wait, will it hurt?

22:33.697 --> 22:34.788
No, not at all, sweetie.

22:34.813 --> 22:36.313
You'll be asleep the whole time.

22:36.338 --> 22:39.213
And when you wake up, we
can get chocolate sundaes.

22:40.531 --> 22:42.382
So it's okay if they take them out?

22:42.587 --> 22:44.128
Mm-hmm.

22:44.153 --> 22:46.275
Ms. Paulson, can we speak to
you outside for a moment?

22:52.339 --> 22:53.740
Okay, you heard her.

22:53.765 --> 22:55.324
You have her assent. Take them out.

22:55.349 --> 22:56.584
It was not an informed decision.

22:56.609 --> 22:57.678
Well, Emma's nine years old.

22:57.703 --> 22:59.716
She didn't understand half
of what you were saying.

22:59.741 --> 23:01.911
Again, regardless of her
age, it's very important

23:01.936 --> 23:04.659
that we at least try and
explain the situation to Emma,

23:04.684 --> 23:06.724
so we can give her a chance
to tell us how she feels.

23:06.749 --> 23:08.502
I... I know how she feels.

23:08.527 --> 23:11.196
I know my child, and I won't
let you manipulate her.

23:11.238 --> 23:12.972
We were not trying to manipulate her.

23:12.997 --> 23:14.179
Why don't we take a beat,

23:14.204 --> 23:15.910
let Dr. Manning and I
put our heads together,

23:15.935 --> 23:17.528
and see if we can come up
with a course of action

23:17.553 --> 23:20.121
that everybody's
comfortable with, okay?

23:25.911 --> 23:27.622
I take it things didn't go well.

23:27.647 --> 23:30.421
Emma's mom coerced her into
having her testes removed.

23:30.446 --> 23:32.320
Yeah, we gotta get Goodwin involved

23:32.345 --> 23:35.070
to see if we can convene
an emergency ethics panel.

23:35.095 --> 23:37.965
We have three hours tops
until the testicle dies.

23:37.990 --> 23:39.891
We better move fast.

23:44.359 --> 23:47.131
Given the placement and
orientation of the handprints

23:47.156 --> 23:49.857
on Carter's back, there's
no way they're his own.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.587
Okay? So?

23:52.612 --> 23:53.871
So Carter told my brother, Jay,

23:53.896 --> 23:56.270
that he tried to slap
out the flames on Bo.

23:56.453 --> 23:58.555
I haven't said anything to Jay.

23:58.580 --> 24:01.641
So, you think Carter may
have started the fire

24:01.666 --> 24:03.162
and is blaming Bo?

24:03.187 --> 24:05.644
Carter tested positive for THC.

24:08.086 --> 24:09.621
Bo was clean.

24:11.578 --> 24:13.179
Thank you, Dr. Halstead.

24:25.285 --> 24:27.134
What you up to?

24:27.159 --> 24:28.498
I'm trying to write a budget

24:28.523 --> 24:30.153
for this research grant application,

24:30.178 --> 24:31.993
but Excel formulas hate me.

24:32.018 --> 24:33.728
Well, I don't know if you know this,

24:33.753 --> 24:36.757
but I am kinda a math whiz.

24:37.110 --> 24:39.612
I am, I can take a stab at it,
if you wanna go see your dad.

24:39.637 --> 24:40.780
I don't.

24:40.805 --> 24:42.725
I... I... I don't want
to talk about him,

24:42.750 --> 24:45.052
and I don't wanna see him.

24:45.077 --> 24:46.845
Okay?

24:47.816 --> 24:49.483
Yeah.

24:54.025 --> 24:55.985
Noah...

24:58.464 --> 25:00.317
I know you Sextons are
as thick as thieves,

25:00.342 --> 25:02.256
but not every family's like that.

25:07.453 --> 25:09.100
April?

25:15.479 --> 25:18.034
Your son is coming, Henry.

25:18.059 --> 25:20.407
Jackson's coming.

25:20.545 --> 25:22.696
Thank you.

25:23.582 --> 25:25.287
My angel.

25:28.470 --> 25:30.406
Metzenbaum and DeBakey Forceps.

25:33.309 --> 25:35.510
Reopening the atriotomy now.

25:37.962 --> 25:39.863
I'll need better visualization.
Suction.

25:44.833 --> 25:47.370
Ah-ha. There it is.

25:48.279 --> 25:50.788
Stuck in the ostia of
the pulmonary vein.

25:51.156 --> 25:52.687
What is it?

25:53.334 --> 25:56.010
It's the tip of a suction catheter.

25:57.077 --> 25:58.975
You were the only one on suction.

26:00.965 --> 26:02.766
Then hold on.

26:03.089 --> 26:04.846
Cardiac suction catheters

26:04.871 --> 26:07.351
don't have detachable tips.

26:07.691 --> 26:11.101
At one point, Dr. Bekker had
to suction an area herself.

26:11.126 --> 26:13.963
I handed her a catheter
from a trauma tray.

26:14.526 --> 26:16.188
I think it's yours.

26:20.522 --> 26:23.457
Well, we're going to need
to take it out, aren't we?

26:23.482 --> 26:25.085
Stone forceps. Forceps.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.763
Got it.

26:36.933 --> 26:38.187
His BP is dropping.

26:38.212 --> 26:39.711
The vessel tore. He's bleeding out.

26:39.736 --> 26:41.164
Quick, get me some 5-0 Prolene

26:41.189 --> 26:42.510
and a long needle driver.

26:42.535 --> 26:44.251
Careful you don't ligate the vein.

26:44.276 --> 26:45.910
If you narrow it, he could
lose part of his lung.

26:45.935 --> 26:47.406
Why don't you stop backseat driving

26:47.431 --> 26:48.998
and help me save his life?

27:03.135 --> 27:04.735
You okay?

27:04.996 --> 27:06.728
Yes.

27:07.862 --> 27:09.529
No.

27:09.563 --> 27:11.287
My patient's mom is trying to force

27:11.312 --> 27:12.822
an invasive surgery on her.

27:12.847 --> 27:14.640
Unless the ethics committee intervenes,

27:14.665 --> 27:16.634
I don't think I'm gonna
be able to stop it.

27:17.630 --> 27:19.796
I mean, I know I shouldn't
be unloading on you.

27:19.821 --> 27:22.582
I'm... I know we're... I'm sorry.

27:23.179 --> 27:25.937
No, it's okay. Case sounds tough.

27:26.363 --> 27:28.274
Sorry, Nat...

27:28.524 --> 27:30.362
but I know you'll figure it out.

27:30.510 --> 27:32.111
Yeah.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.307
You look exhausted.

27:37.651 --> 27:39.315
Are you okay?

27:39.519 --> 27:41.227
Uh, yeah.

27:41.362 --> 27:44.084
Had a tough time...
sleeping last night.

27:44.109 --> 27:46.028
Anyway, good luck.

27:50.284 --> 27:53.436
Finished repairing the
pulmonary vein laceration.

27:53.655 --> 27:55.665
BP any better, Marty? Talk to me.

27:55.690 --> 27:57.257
Vitals are stable.

27:59.144 --> 28:00.559
Dr. Rhodes, close the atriotomy,

28:00.584 --> 28:02.872
take the patient off
bypass, and staple him up.

28:02.897 --> 28:04.365
Uh, wait a second,
you're the lead here.

28:04.390 --> 28:06.217
You have to decide how
you want him closed.

28:06.875 --> 28:08.843
Wires or plates and
screws for the sternum?

28:08.869 --> 28:10.235
Don't you remember how
we closed him last time?

28:10.260 --> 28:11.975
Do it again.

28:19.806 --> 28:21.525
I don't know who the
hell you think you are,

28:21.550 --> 28:22.790
but that stunt you just pulled,

28:22.815 --> 28:25.047
leaving me there to clean up your mess?

28:30.081 --> 28:31.915
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

28:34.230 --> 28:35.790
Come on, Ava, you don't have to worry

28:35.831 --> 28:37.025
about your reputation, okay?

28:37.050 --> 28:39.167
This isn't some reflection
of your surgical skill.

28:39.192 --> 28:42.662
This is just... it... it's human error.

28:42.687 --> 28:44.081
It could happen to anybody.

28:44.106 --> 28:46.714
You really think it's my reputation

28:46.739 --> 28:48.306
I'm worried about?

28:48.331 --> 28:51.681
Bruce... Bruce almost died today,

28:51.938 --> 28:53.938
because of my stupid mistake.

28:53.963 --> 28:56.476
He didn't... Hey, listen to me.

28:57.504 --> 28:59.226
Ava, he didn't.

29:01.251 --> 29:03.330
He didn't, okay?

29:03.355 --> 29:06.295
He's in recovery because
of what you did.

29:06.320 --> 29:10.120
Oh... What if he has deficits?

29:12.679 --> 29:14.840
I could never forgive myself.

29:18.909 --> 29:21.811
Involuntary manslaughter's
a class three felony.

29:21.836 --> 29:23.803
Carries a potential jail sentence.

29:23.828 --> 29:25.441
It certainly doesn't help matters

29:25.466 --> 29:27.012
if Carter lied during his statement.

29:27.037 --> 29:28.173
Why are we discussing charges

29:28.198 --> 29:30.087
when we should be
talking to the police?

29:32.008 --> 29:33.919
I'm sorry...

29:34.552 --> 29:36.820
but whatever the consequences are,

29:36.845 --> 29:39.080
Carter needs to face them.

29:39.105 --> 29:40.586
You're right.

29:41.391 --> 29:43.726
Thank you, gentlemen,
for filling us in.

29:43.751 --> 29:45.685
We'll handle it from here.

29:51.978 --> 29:54.814
Look, Sharon...

29:54.993 --> 29:57.015
CFD and CPD will conduct

29:57.040 --> 29:59.741
their own very thorough investigation,

29:59.776 --> 30:03.249
and it is in the hospital's
best interest and frankly yours

30:03.274 --> 30:05.071
to not put yourself in the middle.

30:05.096 --> 30:07.164
But I am in the middle, Peter.

30:07.189 --> 30:08.610
Carter's my godson.

30:08.635 --> 30:10.688
I've known this boy since
he was in diapers.

30:10.713 --> 30:13.878
He's not some master manipulator.

30:14.293 --> 30:17.333
If he lied, it's because he was scared.

30:17.358 --> 30:19.800
Beside the fact that the
Singleton's are your friends,

30:19.825 --> 30:22.093
they are also major
donors to this hospital,

30:22.118 --> 30:24.900
and there is a multimillion
dollar relationship

30:24.925 --> 30:26.026
at stake here.

30:26.051 --> 30:27.977
So if the kid is gonna get in trouble,

30:28.002 --> 30:31.238
please, let PD be the bad guys.

30:35.108 --> 30:37.963
Any word from the ethics committee?

30:39.938 --> 30:41.226
No way.

30:41.251 --> 30:42.884
No way they're gonna allow this.

30:42.909 --> 30:44.102
Because, technically,

30:44.127 --> 30:46.568
they have both Judy and Emma's consent,

30:46.593 --> 30:49.352
and because testicular torsion
is a medical emergency,

30:49.377 --> 30:51.148
the hospital feels obligated to act.

30:51.173 --> 30:52.474
But the assent was coerced.

30:52.499 --> 30:54.467
Yeah, but coercion's
very difficult to prove,

30:54.492 --> 30:56.393
and the truth is that in the
majority of these cases,

30:56.418 --> 30:58.319
the court's do side with the parents.

30:58.344 --> 31:00.467
The board's worried about
a negligence suit.

31:00.492 --> 31:02.025
What?

31:02.050 --> 31:03.618
Oh, no. Oh.

31:05.634 --> 31:07.343
Help. Someone, help.

31:14.049 --> 31:16.251
Uh, what... what... what... what's...
What's wrong with her?

31:16.276 --> 31:17.775
The testicle must be more ischemic.

31:17.800 --> 31:20.042
Not getting enough blood flow.

31:20.067 --> 31:21.556
We can't wait any longer.

31:21.581 --> 31:23.067
Prep this patient for surgery now.

31:23.092 --> 31:25.209
Mommy, I'm scared. I don't
want them to hurt me.

31:25.234 --> 31:27.202
No, no, no, honey, they
won't hurt you, I promise.

31:27.227 --> 31:29.185
Judy, I know you love your daughter,

31:29.210 --> 31:31.378
and I know you're afraid of
what the future might hold,

31:31.403 --> 31:33.876
but Emma trusts you, she counts on you.

31:33.901 --> 31:35.365
I just... I don't want anything
to happen to my little girl.

31:35.390 --> 31:37.645
- She's all that I have.
- You're not gonna lose her.

31:37.670 --> 31:39.634
No matter what gender
Emma identifies with,

31:39.659 --> 31:41.084
she's still gonna be your child,

31:41.109 --> 31:43.048
the same kid who loves
chocolate sundaes

31:43.073 --> 31:45.700
- and hates ballet.
- She told you?

31:45.725 --> 31:47.462
That's the exciting part:

31:47.487 --> 31:50.021
having our kids show us who
they are in their own time.

31:50.046 --> 31:51.682
Mommy?

31:53.022 --> 31:55.012
Mommy?

31:56.613 --> 31:58.903
Don't take them out.

31:58.928 --> 32:00.925
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

32:06.395 --> 32:09.096
Hey, Maggie, any word from Henry's son?

32:09.202 --> 32:10.938
I thought he was just
driving down from Wilmette.

32:10.963 --> 32:12.643
His phone keeps on going to voicemail.

32:12.802 --> 32:14.866
Maybe he changed his mind about coming.

32:14.891 --> 32:16.773
How can he let his father die alone?

32:16.798 --> 32:18.227
We don't know the whole story, April,

32:18.252 --> 32:19.973
what went on between them.

32:20.189 --> 32:21.989
Some things are hard to get over.

32:22.103 --> 32:24.215
I never should have
gotten Henry's hopes up.

32:24.613 --> 32:27.298
- I have to tell him.
- I'll go with you.

32:36.481 --> 32:38.171
Henry?

32:39.352 --> 32:40.907
Henry...

32:42.424 --> 32:43.949
Jackson...

32:44.743 --> 32:46.915
- Son...
- Henry, I'm sorry...

32:46.940 --> 32:48.402
I'm here.

32:53.396 --> 32:55.034
I'm right here.

32:57.235 --> 32:58.857
You came?

33:00.585 --> 33:01.885
Yeah.

33:02.107 --> 33:03.783
My boy.

33:04.978 --> 33:06.913
My boy.

33:26.424 --> 33:28.652
The evidence is substantial,

33:28.677 --> 33:31.222
and it's in Carter's best interest

33:31.247 --> 33:34.093
to come clean to the police on his own.

33:34.118 --> 33:35.738
A jury will look favorably on that.

33:35.763 --> 33:39.499
A jury? Oh, God. No.

33:39.524 --> 33:42.883
Sharon, I am begging you,

33:43.066 --> 33:45.450
- please do not say anything.
- Lydia...

33:45.475 --> 33:48.620
This will not bring Bo back,

33:48.863 --> 33:51.898
and it will ruin Carter's life.

33:59.603 --> 34:02.662
- Grace?
- I had to talk to you.

34:02.687 --> 34:04.775
When we got here,

34:04.800 --> 34:08.135
Dr. Choi told us what, uh, Carter did.

34:08.159 --> 34:09.416
Grace, I...

34:09.440 --> 34:12.268
He said when the
paramedics found the boys,

34:12.596 --> 34:14.094
that Carter...

34:14.483 --> 34:17.051
was performing CPR on Bo.

34:20.014 --> 34:22.755
I'm so sorry, Lydia.

34:22.780 --> 34:27.120
I'm so sorry that Bo got
Carter into this mess.

34:27.145 --> 34:29.244
I'm so sorry.

34:45.137 --> 34:46.536
Hey, Will...

34:46.562 --> 34:49.056
thank you for earlier.

34:49.081 --> 34:50.716
I didn't do anything.

34:50.741 --> 34:52.920
Well, that's the point.
You just listened.

34:52.946 --> 34:54.413
I appreciate it.

34:54.681 --> 34:56.196
All right.

34:56.221 --> 34:59.223
Well, I'm always here to lend
an ear anytime you need.

34:59.432 --> 35:01.400
How 'bout tonight?

35:01.425 --> 35:03.526
Oysters at Shaw's?

35:05.336 --> 35:07.441
- Sure.
- Okay.

35:29.472 --> 35:31.365
Hey.

35:32.139 --> 35:33.606
You know the last time

35:33.631 --> 35:36.101
we were in a hospital room together?

35:38.281 --> 35:40.377
The day you were born.

35:41.889 --> 35:44.533
- You were there?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

35:44.619 --> 35:46.987
I was holding you when
you opened your eyes

35:47.012 --> 35:48.625
for the first time.

35:48.830 --> 35:51.204
You know, they say it
takes about a week

35:51.229 --> 35:53.829
for a newborn to focus on objects,

35:54.153 --> 35:55.987
but I swear,

35:56.012 --> 35:58.587
you looked right at me.

35:58.954 --> 36:00.555
And that was it.

36:00.580 --> 36:02.339
I was hooked.

36:03.223 --> 36:05.728
You know, Carter, you're my godson.

36:06.599 --> 36:10.166
I only want what's best for you.

36:10.474 --> 36:12.591
And if there's anything else

36:12.616 --> 36:15.300
you need to tell the police, baby,

36:15.761 --> 36:18.165
now is the time.

36:18.888 --> 36:20.455
You...

36:23.102 --> 36:25.537
You're gonna carry this day with you

36:25.562 --> 36:28.080
for the rest of your life,

36:28.811 --> 36:32.119
and holding a secret on top of that...

36:33.075 --> 36:35.576
it'll be too much, baby.

36:40.812 --> 36:43.013
It'll break you, Carter.

36:44.869 --> 36:47.403
It'll break you.

36:58.682 --> 37:00.992
Yes, he's hanging in. Yeah, I'll...

37:01.017 --> 37:04.066
Let... let... let me call you
back, Miles, thanks, bye.

37:08.375 --> 37:10.109
What is he doing here?

37:10.143 --> 37:13.246
Carter asked to speak with
Detective Halstead again.

37:13.280 --> 37:15.348
What did you say to him?

37:15.382 --> 37:17.650
I'm sorry, Lydia.

37:22.322 --> 37:24.090
You're sorry?

37:31.498 --> 37:33.666
That was the right thing to do, Ms.
Goodwin.

37:37.070 --> 37:39.746
Yeah, I think that's debatable.

37:40.271 --> 37:42.405
When the Singletons pull their funding,

37:42.430 --> 37:44.931
which I imagine they're going to do,

37:45.132 --> 37:47.240
you're gonna have to
answer to the board.

37:51.068 --> 37:53.041
I'm prepared to do that.

38:28.502 --> 38:31.538
Noah... what you did in there...

38:31.572 --> 38:33.086
You think I was wrong

38:33.111 --> 38:35.059
for letting him think
his son was there.

38:35.405 --> 38:38.498
No. No, I don't. I think
it was really kind.

38:42.249 --> 38:43.983
I'm sorry I snapped at you earlier.

38:44.018 --> 38:45.952
No, you don't... you don't
have to apologize. That's...

38:45.986 --> 38:48.816
No, I do. I do. You were
just being a friend.

38:52.261 --> 38:53.728
When I said I didn't wanna see my dad,

38:53.753 --> 38:55.638
the truth is I don't
want to want to see him.

38:55.663 --> 38:58.120
Does that make sense?

38:59.210 --> 39:00.656
- Um...
- It's okay.

39:01.232 --> 39:03.143
It doesn't make sense to me either.

39:06.661 --> 39:09.274
- Night, Noah.
- Night.

39:31.602 --> 39:33.827
- How's the patient?
- Just waking up.

39:33.979 --> 39:37.067
But his vitals are stable and
he's neurologically intact.

39:37.092 --> 39:38.245
Ah.

39:38.724 --> 39:41.158
I suppose you know what
I'm going to ask next.

39:41.519 --> 39:42.976
It was my instrument, Dr. Latham.

39:43.001 --> 39:44.350
I take full responsibility.

39:44.375 --> 39:46.610
No, it was my instrument. My fault.

39:46.752 --> 39:48.995
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

39:49.738 --> 39:52.213
Ah.

39:56.350 --> 39:58.685
My rabbi used to say,

39:59.084 --> 40:01.851
<i>"Klieg, Klieg, Klieg, du bist a nar."</i>

40:02.030 --> 40:03.497
Ah.

40:03.522 --> 40:05.700
"You are smart, smart, smart,

40:05.725 --> 40:08.245
but, eh, not so smart."

40:09.728 --> 40:13.034
You both are my most promising fellows,

40:13.508 --> 40:15.843
but now I am no longer
certain that either of you

40:15.868 --> 40:18.500
should be my second for the
conjoined twins surgery.

40:19.916 --> 40:22.757
I'll be watching you both
very closely going forward.

40:31.809 --> 40:34.604
- You didn't have to do that.
- I know.

40:34.710 --> 40:37.645
- I can take my lumps.
- Never said you couldn't.

40:43.077 --> 40:45.188
I guess we're both in the doghouse now.

40:45.213 --> 40:47.114
Plenty of room for two.

40:48.555 --> 40:50.430
Don't worry, you get used to it.

40:50.455 --> 40:52.313
Builds character.

40:54.544 --> 40:56.068
Here you are, sir.

40:59.317 --> 41:00.266
Oh, hey.

41:00.586 --> 41:03.618
I ordered us half a dozen
of Henderson Bay oysters.

41:03.643 --> 41:05.015
What do you want to drink?

41:05.040 --> 41:07.104
- Uh, excuse me...
- Wait, Nat...

41:09.068 --> 41:11.403
If there's any chance we're
moving forward here,

41:11.428 --> 41:12.944
there's something I gotta tell you.

41:12.969 --> 41:14.302
What is it?

41:17.922 --> 41:20.557
Last night after work,
I grabbed a drink.

41:20.582 --> 41:22.783
I met someone at the bar.

41:22.808 --> 41:25.560
It was nothing. It was
just high school stuff.

41:25.585 --> 41:28.913
- High school stuff?
- It didn't go beyond kissing.

41:30.597 --> 41:31.610
Well, not much.

41:31.635 --> 41:34.072
And I... I thought of you.
I put the brakes on.

41:34.244 --> 41:37.176
I actually fell asleep on her couch.

41:37.484 --> 41:39.728
Were you thinking of me when
you went home with her?

41:41.796 --> 41:44.628
Nat, you've been so distant
the past two weeks,

41:44.835 --> 41:47.541
I didn't know if things would
turn around between us...

41:47.566 --> 41:48.959
You know, when I asked for a break,

41:48.984 --> 41:51.306
it was never about wanting anyone else.

41:51.331 --> 41:53.648
I don't want anyone else.

41:54.034 --> 41:56.669
It meant nothing, I swear.
Nat, I'm so s...
