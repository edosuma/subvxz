        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:05.100 --> 00:07.300
          Another beer, Sam.    

00:07.400 --> 00:08.600
     Uh, put it on my tab.      

00:08.700 --> 00:11.200
        Actually, Paul,         
    we don't run tabs here.     

00:11.300 --> 00:12.900
        What do you mean        
    you don't run tabs here?    

00:13.000 --> 00:15.400
    Norm Peterson has a tab     
     the size of his pants.     

00:16.400 --> 00:18.700
Well, that's, that's Norm.      

00:18.800 --> 00:19.900
      Well, this is Paul.       

00:19.900 --> 00:21.900
     Come on, Norm doesn't      
    have much in life,          

00:22.000 --> 00:23.200
         except Cheers.         

00:23.300 --> 00:24.700
         What about me?         
        I'm unemployed.         

00:24.800 --> 00:27.000
     I don't like <i>my</i> wife.      

00:28.900 --> 00:31.400
    You're putting me           
     in a tough spot here.      

00:31.400 --> 00:33.400
        I'm sorry, Sam,         
      I really want a tab.      

00:33.400 --> 00:34.700
Yeah, I want a tab, too.        

00:34.900 --> 00:36.100
MAN:                            
Hey, you guys                   
are getting tabs?               

00:36.200 --> 00:38.100
                 Hey, everybody,
         we're all getting tabs.

00:38.100 --> 00:39.400
No, you're not.                 
Put that back.                  

00:40.400 --> 00:41.700
     Paul, you see what...      

00:41.800 --> 00:43.300
  Sam, I'm sitting here         
    until I get a tab.          

00:43.300 --> 00:44.300
                    What are you
                  talking about?

00:44.300 --> 00:45.500
                    Paul doesn't
                have a tab here?

00:45.600 --> 00:46.900
                         Please.

00:46.900 --> 00:48.100
              This is one of our

00:48.200 --> 00:49.400
                      most loyal
            customers for years.

00:49.400 --> 00:52.100
        If anyone deserves a tab
    in this joint, it's Paul.   

00:52.200 --> 00:53.700
        All right.              

00:53.700 --> 00:55.300
We'll run a tab for Paul.       

00:55.300 --> 00:57.000
Hey, thanks, Norm.              

00:57.100 --> 00:59.400
                Can I have beer,
        please, Sam, and, uh,   

00:59.500 --> 01:02.200
                why don't we put
            it on Paul's tab?

02:16.400 --> 02:18.600
          Carla, it's           
    the first of the month.     

02:18.600 --> 02:20.100
Where's my rent check           

02:20.200 --> 02:22.600
        for the poolroom        
    and the bathrooms?          

02:22.700 --> 02:24.300
         Here you are.          

02:24.300 --> 02:27.900
         Buy yourself a melon in
    case you misplace your head.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.900
         Thank you.             

02:31.900 --> 02:33.400
Tell me, Carla,                 
clinically speaking,            

02:33.500 --> 02:36.000
are you considered              
a dwarf or a midget?            

02:37.800 --> 02:42.600
    Say, is that your head or is
     your neck blowing a bubble?

02:45.800 --> 02:47.200
Somebody phone                  
the authorities in Paris.       

02:47.300 --> 02:49.400
A gargoyle has just             
fallen off Notre Dame           

02:49.500 --> 02:51.400
and is now taking               
drink orders.                   

02:51.400 --> 02:54.100
                You know, two   
                 heads like that

02:54.200 --> 02:56.700
                    would make a
            perfectly good butt.

02:59.700 --> 03:02.300
         Shrike.                
                 Bullet head.   

03:02.400 --> 03:04.700
        Slattern.               
                 Hatchet face.  

03:04.700 --> 03:07.400
Well, must be off.              

03:07.500 --> 03:09.300
Till next month, then.          

03:12.000 --> 03:14.400
He's good people.               

03:15.700 --> 03:17.200
          Hey, Carla.           

03:17.300 --> 03:18.800
What's the matter, Eefus?       

03:18.900 --> 03:22.600
          Well, you served table
three's drinks to table five.   

03:22.600 --> 03:25.400
         That's a five?         

03:25.500 --> 03:26.700
      Yeah, can't you read that?

03:26.900 --> 03:28.600
                          CLIFF:
                    Aw, it's not
              surprising, Woody.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.800
 Carla's reaching               
 that age                       

03:29.800 --> 03:32.800
 where the lens of the cornea   
 loses its elasticity.          

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
They do say that the eye        
is the first to go.             

03:36.100 --> 03:37.200
(chuckles)                      

03:37.200 --> 03:38.400
        Keep it up              

03:38.400 --> 03:41.200
and your teeth will be          
the first to go.                

03:46.300 --> 03:48.200
That was clearly                
a three there, Eefus.           

03:48.300 --> 03:50.600
Get your orders straight.       

03:50.600 --> 03:51.700
Good morning.                   

03:51.700 --> 03:53.000
                Hey, Rebecca,   

03:53.100 --> 03:55.200
        you got to get on the   
     phone with the distributor.

03:55.300 --> 03:56.900
I'm still out of vermouth.      

03:57.000 --> 03:58.200
          Yeah, yeah,           
  I'll do that this afternoon.  

03:58.200 --> 04:00.500
    I have to work on           
my own plans this morning.      

04:00.600 --> 04:01.700
      Your plans for what?      

04:01.700 --> 04:02.400
    For what I'm going to do    

04:02.500 --> 04:03.400
      when I buy your bar.      

04:03.500 --> 04:05.900
          (laughing):           
    Oh, those plans, right.     

04:07.300 --> 04:09.500
Oh, how can I forget that?      

04:09.500 --> 04:11.300
You're not taking me seriously, 
         are you, Sam?          

04:11.400 --> 04:13.800
        No, no, I'm not.        
          No, I'm not.          

04:13.900 --> 04:15.600
You, the bar owner.             

04:15.700 --> 04:16.899
     "Hi, I'm Rebecca Howe.     

04:16.899 --> 04:18.200
      "Welcome to my bar.       

04:18.300 --> 04:20.800
     "Gee, you know, we're      
a little low on vermouth today. 

04:20.899 --> 04:23.100
     "Maybe I ought to get      
  on the phone and order some   

04:23.100 --> 04:24.600
"because, after all,            
this is...                      

04:24.700 --> 04:26.600
                 my bar."       

04:26.700 --> 04:27.700
That is not funny.              

04:27.700 --> 04:29.200
 Yeah, well, I guess to get it, 

04:29.300 --> 04:31.500
  you'd have to be a bar owner  
    or out of vermouth          

04:31.600 --> 04:34.300
            and I'm both,       
             so order it.       

04:34.400 --> 04:35.600
              Sam, I am prepared
                     to make you

04:35.700 --> 04:37.500
              a legitimate offer
                    on this bar.

04:37.500 --> 04:40.900
                 I can offer you
         $25,000 cash right now.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.200
How about $15,000 in cash       
and $10,000 in vermouth?!       

04:45.200 --> 04:47.500
    Sam, I'm serious.           

04:47.600 --> 04:49.600
Where are you going to get      
that kind of money?             

04:49.700 --> 04:50.600
                     (scoffing):
                I have a degree.

04:50.700 --> 04:52.000
            I'm a businesswoman.

04:52.100 --> 04:54.300
    I just spent the last ten   
years in a major corporation.   

04:54.400 --> 04:57.400
                      My daddy's
                giving it to me.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.600
He's just giving it to you?     

04:58.700 --> 04:59.900
            Well, no, we have   
                an agreement.   

04:59.900 --> 05:01.300
                    He agreed to
            give me the money   

05:01.400 --> 05:02.900
                 and I agreed to
        never again come home   

05:03.000 --> 05:06.500
    and cry so hard that I throw
         up at the dinner table.

05:06.600 --> 05:09.300
  This is a bit of a surprise,  
    isn't it, Rebecca?          

05:09.300 --> 05:11.000
Why do you want Cheers?         
I would think                   

05:11.100 --> 05:12.800
for you this bar would only have

05:12.800 --> 05:14.900
     negative associations      
    connected with it.          

05:15.000 --> 05:17.700
Well, think of all the          
heartbreak you've had here,     

05:17.800 --> 05:20.000
      the forgotten goals,      
the missed opportunities.       

05:20.100 --> 05:22.400
        Hey, it's called        
    atmosphere, babe.           

05:22.500 --> 05:24.600
     I would think for you      

05:24.700 --> 05:26.900
     this place would have      
     the stench of failure.     

05:27.000 --> 05:28.900
No, that's Clavin,              

05:28.900 --> 05:32.200
and F.Y.I.,                     
it's not just failure.          

05:32.300 --> 05:34.000
                    You know,   
            actually, Lilith,   

05:34.000 --> 05:36.500
          I had more productive,
      successful times at Cheers

05:36.500 --> 05:38.500
          than I've had anyplace
                else in my life.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.700
         Dear God.              

05:41.900 --> 05:44.000
      Oh, I'm sorry.            

05:44.100 --> 05:45.900
      I was thinking            
    of something else.          

05:48.900 --> 05:51.200
        Sweetheart, I-I think   
             it's a great idea--

05:51.300 --> 05:52.500
                you know, you   
            running a business--

05:52.600 --> 05:53.800
                  but you got to
        understand something.   

05:53.900 --> 05:56.700
        This bar is not for sale
     at any price, end of story.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.000
Do you really mean that?        

05:58.000 --> 06:00.400
Because I'm not going to come   
to you with this offer again.   

06:00.500 --> 06:02.000
            Well, I'll just have
              to live with that.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.500
                I-I-I'll hold   
                  it in my heart

06:03.600 --> 06:05.800
            and remember all the
         laughter it brought me.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.200
                  Oh, and by the
                  way, you know,

06:07.300 --> 06:09.500
that vermouth is not going to   
    order itself, there, Sparky.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.600
         Sam!                   

06:11.600 --> 06:12.300
                        (laughs)
        Come on.                

06:12.500 --> 06:13.800
                      I'm sorry.

06:13.900 --> 06:15.500
        You're right, I'm not   
      taking you seriously here.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.500
                     I got to be
                     supportive.

06:16.600 --> 06:19.700
                  All right, uh,
                  tell you what.

06:19.800 --> 06:20.900
    I will sell you this bar.   

06:21.000 --> 06:22.200
        You will?               
                        Yeah.   

06:22.200 --> 06:23.400
                 What would be a
                fair price here?

06:23.500 --> 06:26.300
                  We got liquor,
            glasses, bar stools.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.500
            Oh, I don't know,   
          let's say $25 million.

06:29.500 --> 06:32.300
         Come on, Sam.          

06:32.300 --> 06:33.200
    Oh, don't be so negative.   

06:33.300 --> 06:35.300
         Here, I'll show you how
            supportive I can be.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.700
     All right, let's take      
 a collection here for Rebecca. 

06:36.800 --> 06:38.100
    I need a tin can.           

06:38.200 --> 06:40.100
Oh, yeah, here we go, all right.
                        Hey, yo,
                         yo, yo.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.000
Whoop-- all right, there you go.

06:43.100 --> 06:45.900
Okay, let's help, uh,           

06:46.000 --> 06:47.500
 Rebecca pay for this bar here. 

06:47.600 --> 06:50.300
 I'll tell you what, I am going 
to put in a nickel myself.      

06:50.300 --> 06:51.500
                Now, can anyone,

06:51.600 --> 06:52.600
        uh, match that?         

06:52.700 --> 06:53.900
Anybody?                        

06:54.000 --> 06:56.100
        Ooh, not looking        
        good here, babe.        

06:56.200 --> 06:59.000
I hope you're having fun.       

06:59.100 --> 06:59.900
    Actually, I'm not.          

07:00.100 --> 07:02.200
You know, fund-raising          
is really hard work.            

07:04.900 --> 07:06.600
I must be doing somethin' right.

07:06.700 --> 07:10.300
A guy just gave me a ten dollar 
     tip on a $30 bar tab.      

07:10.400 --> 07:13.400
                That's a single.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.300
            Oh, man.            

07:15.400 --> 07:17.700
     Well, I might as well      
      get this over with.       

07:17.700 --> 07:19.100
      Woody, cover for me.      

07:19.100 --> 07:21.100
I shouldn't put this off        
any longer.                     

07:21.200 --> 07:22.800
    There you go, now you're    
     thinking there, Carla.     

07:22.800 --> 07:24.800
Get those eyes checked out      
        properly.               

07:24.900 --> 07:25.800
    Forget that.                

07:25.900 --> 07:29.500
I'm going to run the cheapskate 
        over like a dog.        

07:29.600 --> 07:31.800
    Well, if your eyes          
    are in such great shape,    

07:31.800 --> 07:34.300
     then how come you took     
    my car keys by mistake?     

07:34.300 --> 07:35.400
      That was no mistake.      

07:35.500 --> 07:38.300
You think I want his blood      
     and hair on <i>my</i> fender?     

07:43.800 --> 07:46.400
                    Oh, I see   
                     a starfish.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.800
                          CLIFF:
    I think it's a manta ray.   

07:47.900 --> 07:50.100
  You showing ink blots again,  
        Dr. Crane?              

07:50.100 --> 07:51.100
              Uh, no, Woody.    

07:51.200 --> 07:53.500
    We are engaged in something 
        far more challenging    

07:53.600 --> 07:55.600
          than anything Hermann 
     Rorschach ever dreamed up. 

07:55.700 --> 07:57.600
    That's right, Wood, we're   
            trying to figure out

07:57.700 --> 08:00.900
     the five hidden pictures on
    Melville's kiddie place mat.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.700
SAM:                            
Okay, boys.                     

08:05.800 --> 08:07.000
                  Tell you what,
                let's check, uh,

08:07.100 --> 08:08.900
      Rebecca's tote board here,

08:08.900 --> 08:11.400
        ladies and gentlemen.   

08:11.400 --> 08:16.500
      All right, you can see her
    goal here of $25 million.   

08:16.600 --> 08:17.700
Let's check that                
against                         

08:17.800 --> 08:21.000
            the grand total of--
             whoo-- two nickels!

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
                 All right!     

08:22.100 --> 08:25.000
                     Whoo!      

08:26.400 --> 08:28.500
        Uh-oh, wait a minute,   
                  wait a minute.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.600
              That confetti just
              cost you a nickel.

08:30.700 --> 08:32.000
                 Promotion's not
                 free, you know.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.799
        Your jokes              

08:33.900 --> 08:35.900
                 are so childish
                    and moronic.

08:35.900 --> 08:37.799
Well, that's what keeps me      
          young, babe.          

08:37.900 --> 08:39.100
        (both laughing)         
                            MAN:
                        Rebecca.

08:39.200 --> 08:42.000
REBECCA:                        
Oh, Harry, I'm glad             
you're here. Sam.               

08:42.000 --> 08:43.200
        This is my appraiser,   
                      he's going

08:43.200 --> 08:44.900
to tell me how much             
this bar is really worth.       

08:45.000 --> 08:46.500
      Well, I'll save you       
some trouble here, Harry.       

08:46.600 --> 08:49.800
 The bar is worth $25 million.  

08:49.800 --> 08:52.000
        Well, Rebecca, I need   
         to work up the figures,

08:52.100 --> 08:54.500
            but everything seems
            to be in good shape.

08:54.500 --> 08:57.200
         Except for that strange
                floor deformity.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.800
     What floor deformity?      

08:58.900 --> 09:01.100
            There seems to be   
              a depression here.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.400
                  It's almost as
            if this bar stool   

09:08.500 --> 09:11.400
                is sinking right
                 into the earth.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.600
                I wonder what   
            could cause that.   

09:13.700 --> 09:14.800
      Uh, pardon me, pal.       

09:14.800 --> 09:16.900
You're standing between me      
     and my cheese doodles.     

09:19.700 --> 09:21.600
         You know, uh,          

09:21.700 --> 09:23.600
I don't think that a ground     
surface irregularity            

09:23.700 --> 09:25.600
of this nature                  
is so strange.                  

09:25.700 --> 09:26.600
I mean, after all,              

09:26.700 --> 09:28.500
the entire east coast           
is sinking.                     

09:28.600 --> 09:29.800
We all know that.               

09:29.900 --> 09:32.300
I mean, due to global warming,  
the polar ice caps are melting  

09:32.300 --> 09:35.100
and, hey, we're gonna be        
all underwater anyway.          

09:35.200 --> 09:36.300
Yeah, that's why I, uh,         

09:36.400 --> 09:38.200
like to keep a couple           
of cans of tuna                 

09:38.200 --> 09:40.600
and an inflatable raft          
in the trunk of my car.         

09:43.300 --> 09:46.400
Wait a second, I ate the tuna   
a couple of nights ago.         

09:46.500 --> 09:48.400
I'd better go out               
and get some more.              

09:48.400 --> 09:49.600
Boy, if that flood              
comes tonight,                  

09:49.700 --> 09:51.700
I'm really going                
to kick myself.                 

09:53.900 --> 09:56.000
                Harry...        

09:56.100 --> 09:58.300
  do you think you have enough  
 figures to run the appraisal?  

09:58.300 --> 09:59.500
                  Well, just one
                  more question.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.800
        Is that mailman going to
         be hanging around here?

10:01.800 --> 10:03.200
         I don't know.          

10:03.200 --> 10:05.400
              Well, I'll run the
              figures both ways.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.600
Honey, you're wasting your money
running an appraisal like this. 

10:10.700 --> 10:12.200
        Remember,               
 you only got one nickel left.  

10:12.200 --> 10:13.700
(huffing):                      
Sam, you know what?             

10:13.700 --> 10:16.300
         You never take anything
                I say seriously.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.100
        Take this seriously.    

10:18.200 --> 10:20.700
          I will have this bar. 

10:20.800 --> 10:22.000
You're right,                   
I'm sorry.                      

10:22.000 --> 10:23.900
From now on, I'm going          
to take you seriously.          

10:24.000 --> 10:25.700
                         Good.  

10:25.800 --> 10:29.400
(in low voice):                 
This is me taking Rebecca       
seriously.                      

10:29.400 --> 10:32.200
        Come on, guys, let's all
         take Rebecca seriously.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.300
        (in low voice):         
All right, Sam, well, I'm going 
    to be very serious now.     

10:34.400 --> 10:36.500
                 (in low voice):
            Well, what the heck?
     This is a very serious bar.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.000
        I'd like a very         
     serious beer, please.      

10:40.100 --> 10:41.200
    (Sam and Norm laughing)     

10:41.300 --> 10:42.900
     No, I'm serious, Sam,      
         I'd like one.          

10:44.800 --> 10:49.200
You guys                        
are such...                     

10:49.200 --> 10:50.600
                Excuse me, Miss.

10:50.700 --> 10:53.500
                         Is this
                    total right?

10:57.500 --> 10:59.300
          Yeah.                 

10:59.400 --> 11:01.100
What was that?                  

11:01.100 --> 11:04.200
            Nothing.            

11:04.300 --> 11:06.600
There was something across      
the bridge of your nose.        

11:06.700 --> 11:09.500
It was horn-rimmed              
and a little Coke bottle-ish.   

11:09.600 --> 11:11.800
        All right, I went to one
        of those one-hour joints

11:11.800 --> 11:14.700
         and I got myself a pair
             of reading glasses.

11:14.700 --> 11:17.900
But if I hear one single        
comment about Ben Franklin      

11:17.900 --> 11:19.100
or Granny or "four eyes,"       

11:19.200 --> 11:22.200
I will cut out your tongue      
    and fry it up for lunch.    

11:26.100 --> 11:28.100
                (muffled laughs)

11:28.100 --> 11:30.100
                      (laughing)

11:36.000 --> 11:37.500
                      (laughing)

11:37.600 --> 11:39.500
                I don't care.   
            It's worth a tongue.

11:42.700 --> 11:45.000
            Oh darn.            

11:45.000 --> 11:47.500
    These glasses have          
        a spot on them.         

11:53.000 --> 11:55.600
         That's better.         

11:57.400 --> 11:59.200
(laughing)                      

11:59.300 --> 12:00.800
    This is so funny!           

12:02.000 --> 12:03.300
                    What are you
                     doing, Sam?
Huh?                            

12:03.400 --> 12:06.300
Oh, I'm, uh, faking a letter    
from the IRS here saying        

12:06.400 --> 12:08.700
that Rebecca overpaid           
her return last year.           

12:08.800 --> 12:12.600
    So the government           
now owes her $25 million.       

12:12.700 --> 12:15.500
             Sam...             

12:15.600 --> 12:17.300
     Well, it could happen!     

12:17.300 --> 12:19.300
Come on! Give me a break.       

12:19.400 --> 12:21.600
I think your humor is expressing

12:21.700 --> 12:24.000
    a hidden hostility          
        toward Rebecca.         

12:24.100 --> 12:25.700
Or perhaps, deep down, you fear 

12:25.700 --> 12:28.200
     she really is capable      
  of taking this bar from you.  

12:28.300 --> 12:31.400
     Put a suit on a woman      
and she thinks she's God.       

12:33.100 --> 12:34.600
                        Frasier,
                are you going   

12:34.700 --> 12:36.600
to let him                      
talk to me like this?           

12:36.700 --> 12:38.000
             She's also this way

12:38.000 --> 12:39.800
                when the suit   
                 comes off, Sam.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.600
              You should see her
                  rule the roost

12:45.700 --> 12:46.900
         in her bra and panties.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.300
         Well, well...          

12:50.300 --> 12:53.300
        well, hey,              
    it's a compliment, baby!    

12:58.100 --> 12:59.000
          (laughing):           
              Oh!               

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
      Hey, listen to this!      

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
  "P.S. Order some vermouth."   

13:04.100 --> 13:06.100
    (hysterically laughing)     

13:08.100 --> 13:10.000
                  Sam.          
Yeah?                           

13:10.100 --> 13:13.000
I've always known that you felt 
  that my owning the pool room  

13:13.100 --> 13:15.000
 and bathrooms was an unwieldy  
          arrangement.          

13:15.100 --> 13:16.800
     So I found a solution.     

13:16.900 --> 13:18.000
        Oh, good. What?         

13:18.000 --> 13:19.700
I've agreed to sell             
them to Rebecca.                

13:19.800 --> 13:22.700
        I hope you can afford   
              the new rent, Sam,

13:22.800 --> 13:24.500
     but if you have any trouble

13:24.500 --> 13:26.200
             maybe you can throw
              a little telethon.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.200
                  Tell you what.

13:28.300 --> 13:31.300
          (low voice):          
I'm willing to donate a nickel. 

13:33.200 --> 13:35.200
        Oh, no, no, no.         

13:35.300 --> 13:36.300
This is not                     
gonna happen here.              

13:36.300 --> 13:38.400
Listen, if you want to sell     
these rooms to somebody,        

13:38.500 --> 13:39.800
sell them to me.                

13:39.900 --> 13:42.100
I mean, whatever she offered    
you, I'll pay more.             

13:42.100 --> 13:43.400
     Oh, really?                

13:43.400 --> 13:46.300
Why? Wait a minute.             
What-What did she offer you?    

13:46.300 --> 13:49.200
    I offered him the $25,000   
              my father gave me.

13:49.300 --> 13:51.200
Sam, do you have a father?      

13:52.700 --> 13:54.700
             Hold it. Excuse me.
                  Wait a minute.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.200
        You accepted my deal.   

13:56.300 --> 13:57.400
                You said, "Yes."

13:57.500 --> 14:00.400
     "Yes" can mean             
     so many things.            

14:00.500 --> 14:02.200
You see, you see                
what she's trying               

14:02.200 --> 14:04.200
to do here,                     
don't you, John?                

14:04.200 --> 14:06.000
I mean, if she gets a hold      
    of those bathrooms          

14:06.100 --> 14:08.300
 and the pool room, she, she'll 
take the whole bar from me      

14:08.400 --> 14:09.400
    and she's gonna ruin me.    

14:09.500 --> 14:11.100
     Oh, I'm all a tingle.      

14:12.100 --> 14:14.100
     All right. All right.      

14:14.100 --> 14:16.500
Uh, how much did she offer you? 

14:16.500 --> 14:18.200
            $25,000.            

14:18.200 --> 14:19.300
     All right. All right.      

14:19.300 --> 14:21.400
  Uh, $25,000 and one dollar.   

14:21.500 --> 14:22.700
No, no, $20.                    

14:22.800 --> 14:24.100
     Yeah. $25,000 and $20.     

14:24.100 --> 14:25.400
    Let's see you beat that.    

14:25.500 --> 14:27.100
            $30,000.            

14:27.100 --> 14:29.900
      I thought, I thought      
    we were going up in $20.    

14:34.900 --> 14:37.700
It seems we have two interested 
         parties here.          

14:37.800 --> 14:39.400
Perhaps I should                
give it to the one              

14:39.500 --> 14:40.700
                    who wants it
                    the most.   

14:40.700 --> 14:44.000
    The party who's willing     
     to go that extra mile.     

14:44.100 --> 14:47.900
    Oh, dear, I notice          
     my shoelace is untied.     

14:48.000 --> 14:51.300
Oh, give me                     
a break!                        

14:51.400 --> 14:53.900
You expect one of us to get down
     on our hands and knees     

14:53.900 --> 14:56.200
     and tie your shoelace      
so you can give them the rooms? 

14:56.200 --> 14:57.800
                Oh, well to hell
            with you, Mister.   

14:57.800 --> 14:59.400
             You know, nothing's
                     worth that.

15:03.100 --> 15:06.700
         Oh, Christmas is coming
                early this year.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.400
  Ah, Woody, if you see Hill,   
    give him his keys,          

15:17.400 --> 15:19.100
     tell him I'm finished,     
        all right?              

15:19.100 --> 15:21.900
        Oh, Sammy, you didn't   
          wash his car, did you?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.700
 Hey, what do you take me for?  

15:23.800 --> 15:26.400
  I detailed every inch of it.  

15:27.500 --> 15:29.100
Hey, Carla,                     

15:29.100 --> 15:31.300
I heard the guys were kidding   
you about your glasses.         

15:31.400 --> 15:32.600
But I want you to know,         

15:32.600 --> 15:35.300
I think it makes you look       
a lot more intellectual.        

15:35.400 --> 15:36.700
                  Thanks, Woody.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.100
In fact, they...                

15:38.100 --> 15:41.400
they kind of make you           
look like Einstein.             

15:41.500 --> 15:43.100
                Thanks a lot.   
    Yeah,                       

15:43.100 --> 15:46.200
if you could just get your      
hair to do what his does.       

15:46.300 --> 15:49.200
Well, actually,                 
it almost does.                 

15:53.700 --> 15:55.100
            Whoa, whoa, whoa!   

15:55.200 --> 15:56.200
                         Why me?

15:56.200 --> 15:57.800
        I have to work with him.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.200
      Oh, boy, Miss Howe!       

16:07.200 --> 16:09.000
                      When I see
                         a woman

16:09.100 --> 16:10.900
  in a hot little black dress   
        like that,              

16:11.000 --> 16:13.100
 all I can think of is "zowie," 

16:13.200 --> 16:15.300
        and "who died?"         

16:16.200 --> 16:18.200
            Oh, Sam!            

16:18.300 --> 16:20.200
      I want to thank you       
     for washing John's car     

16:20.300 --> 16:21.900
          because after he cooks
          dinner for me tonight,

16:21.900 --> 16:23.600
                he might want me
            to go dancing and...

16:23.700 --> 16:25.600
    I want us to look good.     

16:25.700 --> 16:27.700
    Oh, that's great.           

16:27.800 --> 16:30.900
      I-I send him flowers      
and he takes you dancing.       

16:31.000 --> 16:32.900
              Men.              

16:34.500 --> 16:36.000
                 You know, also,

16:36.100 --> 16:37.600
you can wax John's car          

16:37.600 --> 16:39.700
and you can do                  
his menial tasks,               

16:39.700 --> 16:41.500
but I have something            
you don't have.                 

16:41.600 --> 16:43.400
See you later...                

16:43.500 --> 16:45.500
    or in the morning.          

16:45.600 --> 16:48.500
What does she mean              
by that,                        

16:48.600 --> 16:50.500
she has something               
you don't have?                 

16:54.600 --> 16:57.500
She's got nice hair,            
you got nice hair.              

16:57.600 --> 17:00.800
She's got nice eyes,            
you got nice eyes.              

17:00.900 --> 17:03.000
She's got...                    

17:04.099 --> 17:06.200
Uh-oh, Sam.                     

17:06.300 --> 17:08.200
You're in big trouble.          

17:14.500 --> 17:16.300
That was a very nice            
meal, Mr. Hill.                 

17:16.400 --> 17:17.700
                      Thank you.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.000
I only wish that I could have   
cooked it for you.              

17:20.099 --> 17:21.599
        Oh, well,               
  I didn't want to disturb you  

17:21.599 --> 17:23.700
      while you were doing      
          the windows.          

17:25.599 --> 17:28.800
Why don't we just sit here      
    a while and enjoy           

17:28.800 --> 17:30.000
                  a little wine,

17:30.100 --> 17:32.200
before you do the dishes.       

17:34.200 --> 17:36.500
     Mmm, you know, John...     

17:37.800 --> 17:39.700
        I really deserve        
    that property downstairs    

17:39.700 --> 17:41.000
      more than Sam does.       

17:41.100 --> 17:43.200
Well, deserving something       

17:43.300 --> 17:45.300
         and earning it         
are two different things.       

17:45.300 --> 17:48.300
     Well, you know, John,      

17:48.400 --> 17:51.800
        if you did              
     sell me the property,      

17:51.900 --> 17:55.500
I would be a very friendly      
        neighbor.               

17:55.500 --> 17:57.500
And I'm sure                    
we could come                   

17:57.600 --> 17:59.600
to some mutual agreement.       

17:59.700 --> 18:01.900
    You do know what I mean,    
        don't you?              

18:04.900 --> 18:07.700
(glassed and dishes shattering) 

18:10.400 --> 18:13.300
 Oh, I'll clean that up later.  

18:13.400 --> 18:14.900
    Don't worry about that,     

18:15.000 --> 18:16.900
 we have a real estate purchase 
          to consider.          

18:18.400 --> 18:21.300
    In fact, why don't we go    
      into the next room.       

18:21.400 --> 18:24.400
  We can get under the sheets   
          and haggle.           

18:26.600 --> 18:28.700
        Right now?              

18:28.700 --> 18:30.300
        I'm ready.              

18:30.400 --> 18:32.100
Oh, gee, John.                  

18:32.200 --> 18:34.100
    I think that stain          
     is gonna set in here.      

18:34.200 --> 18:36.000
I'm willing to throw            
caution to the wind             

18:36.100 --> 18:39.100
and say I'll risk               
my carpet.                      

18:39.200 --> 18:40.800
     We really need to put      
        something on it.        

18:40.900 --> 18:42.300
    Very well. How about us?    

18:42.400 --> 18:43.600
             Eww...             

18:43.600 --> 18:44.600
              Oh.               

18:44.700 --> 18:46.000
                         I mean,

18:46.100 --> 18:48.000
         as enchanting          
    as that offer is, John,     

18:48.100 --> 18:51.100
I-I really think club soda      
    would be more effective.    

18:51.100 --> 18:54.600
Oh, you're into club soda,      
            are you?            

18:54.600 --> 18:56.600
No, not really, I just...       

18:56.700 --> 18:59.600
        (softly):               
  What can that possibly mean?  

19:00.800 --> 19:03.000
     Come to Papa, Peaches.     

19:03.000 --> 19:04.400
              Oh, no, no, don't,
                  wait, hold it.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.200
    You know, there's a joint   
         right around the corner

19:06.200 --> 19:07.600
      and they sell these carpet
              cleaning machines.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.100
        This hot water shoots   
         right into the bristles

19:09.200 --> 19:10.500
            and it really cleans
                     it up fast!

19:10.600 --> 19:12.700
Sounds like fun.                
                    No, I really
                better be going.

19:15.100 --> 19:15.800
          You're fast.          

19:16.000 --> 19:17.900
                 And agile.     

19:18.000 --> 19:19.600
    (knocking at door)          

19:19.600 --> 19:21.600
Yes! Come in!                   

19:21.600 --> 19:23.700
                         Oh! Oh!

19:23.800 --> 19:26.500
            Rebecca. Rebecca.   
                        Rebecca.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.100
Sam, I'm really glad to see you.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.400
             I'm just glad      
          I got here in time.   

19:29.400 --> 19:30.900
         I mean, you see what   
         he's driving you to,   

19:30.900 --> 19:33.200
don't you? You're throwing      
    yourself at a man           

19:33.300 --> 19:34.400
             just to gain       
        material things.        

19:34.500 --> 19:36.100
        You know what that      
         makes you, don't you?  

19:36.100 --> 19:39.100
Ahead in the race to get a pool 
    room and two bathrooms.     

19:39.100 --> 19:40.500
    Come on, Rebecca.           

19:40.600 --> 19:42.600
    Yeah, you just stay out     
    of this will you, John?     

19:42.600 --> 19:43.900
  Honey, go downstairs,         

19:44.000 --> 19:45.200
wipe that makeup off,           
will you?                       

19:45.300 --> 19:46.400
  I tell you what,              

19:46.500 --> 19:48.400
why don't you put on            
a nice dress or something,      

19:48.500 --> 19:49.500
maybe call your Mom.            

19:49.600 --> 19:50.900
Bet it's been a while,          
hasn't it?                      

19:51.000 --> 19:52.900
                      Yeah, yes,
                    Sam, it has.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
          Yeah, yeah.           

19:55.100 --> 19:57.900
Actually it's been a while      
    for me, too, Sam.           

19:59.800 --> 20:02.200
  Thanks for spoiling what was  
 going to be a lovely evening.  

20:02.200 --> 20:03.900
         That certainly         
    endears you to me.          

20:03.900 --> 20:06.700
     I just have two words      
         for you, John.         

20:06.700 --> 20:08.400
          What's that?          
             Twins.             

20:08.500 --> 20:10.400
    Come on in, girls.          

20:10.500 --> 20:12.400
    Here's Johnny!              

20:14.600 --> 20:16.400
                 How do you like
              these, Johnny boy?

20:16.500 --> 20:18.400
    Go ahead and touch 'em.     
         They're real.          

20:21.900 --> 20:23.500
            Oh, I just forgot   
                        my...   

20:23.600 --> 20:25.500
                         Wha... 

20:25.600 --> 20:27.400
                Who are they?   
             Uh...              

20:27.500 --> 20:29.100
  this is not what you think.   

20:29.200 --> 20:31.500
Gee, we never met a big         
Hollywood producer before.      

20:33.500 --> 20:35.400
        All right, it's,        
      it's what you think.      

20:35.500 --> 20:37.700
                  Sam, Sam, look
                          at us.
        I know, I know.         

20:37.800 --> 20:39.700
                Do you know what
                he's doing here?
      Yeah.                     

20:39.800 --> 20:41.300
                 He's playing us
             against each other.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.800
You're right.                   
This is disgusting.             

20:42.800 --> 20:44.400
You can't make us act           
like this.                      

20:44.500 --> 20:46.500
You know something? You can     
keep those stupid old rooms.    

20:46.600 --> 20:48.500
All bets are off.               
Come on, let's go.              

20:48.500 --> 20:49.900
  I'm sorry you feel that way.  

20:53.400 --> 20:56.900
  So did Sam explain the part   
     you'll be reading for?     

21:03.100 --> 21:04.400
                     Oh, Sam.   

21:04.500 --> 21:06.900
             I can't believe you
            could sink this low.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.900
You should have seen me         
in my prime.                    

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
             JOHN:              
              Sam.              

21:12.000 --> 21:13.800
  Oh, get out of here,          
    will you, Hill?             

21:13.900 --> 21:15.400
    We don't want your type     
      around here anymore.      

21:15.500 --> 21:16.500
        You're bad news.        

21:16.600 --> 21:18.800
                    Bad news.   

21:18.800 --> 21:20.300
 I just came down to thank you  

21:20.400 --> 21:22.400
    for introducing me          
     to Hope and Joy, Sam.      

21:22.400 --> 21:24.800
 It's very hard to make friends 
         in a new town.         

21:26.100 --> 21:27.400
 The least I can do is sell you 

21:27.500 --> 21:28.700
         the pool room          
    and the bathrooms.          

21:28.800 --> 21:30.700
As I recall,                    
the last                        

21:30.800 --> 21:32.700
    offer was, uh, $30,000.     

21:32.700 --> 21:34.700
             Yeah, but,         

21:34.800 --> 21:36.800
     but I don't have $30,000.  

21:36.900 --> 21:38.000
     How much do you have?      

21:38.100 --> 21:39.300
             $5,000.            

21:39.400 --> 21:41.100
        I'm sorry, Sam.         
It's simply out of the question.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.900
      Yeah, but wait a minute,  
    I-I detailed your car.      

21:45.600 --> 21:48.100
                      Wait, wait
                  a minute, Sam.

21:48.100 --> 21:50.100
                     You do have
                        $30,000.

21:50.200 --> 21:51.600
Oh, wow.                        

21:51.700 --> 21:53.300
Rebecca, you'd do this          
for me?                         

21:53.400 --> 21:55.200
             I'd do this for us.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.300
                      A business
            partnership, Sam.   

21:57.400 --> 21:59.200
    We should have thought of   
          it in the first place.

21:59.300 --> 22:01.300
      Oh, yeah.                 

22:01.300 --> 22:03.100
Wh... yeah,                     
why didn't we?                  

22:03.200 --> 22:04.500
                     Because you
                    were so busy

22:04.500 --> 22:06.200
             making those stupid
                 telethon jokes.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.600
        Oh.                     

22:07.600 --> 22:09.500
Yeah, I'm gonna                 
miss those.                     

22:11.400 --> 22:12.600
    All right, listen.          

22:12.600 --> 22:14.100
        Here's her check        
        and here's mine.        

22:14.200 --> 22:15.800
      That makes $30,000.       

22:15.900 --> 22:17.800
Well, thank you                 
very much.                      

22:17.900 --> 22:19.500
Enjoy your pool room.           

22:19.600 --> 22:20.700
Oh, and you should              

22:20.800 --> 22:22.200
rest well in the knowledge      

22:22.200 --> 22:25.900
that this $30,000 will pay      
  nicely for that screen test.  

22:25.900 --> 22:27.900
    Good news, girls!           

22:28.000 --> 22:30.900
We're going to Hollywood!       

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
             BOTH:              
              Eww!
