00:01.815 --> 00:04.018
<i>I can't believe what happened.</i>

00:04.237 --> 00:07.260
<i>The paper says Midtown High
collapsed in an explosion.</i>

00:07.385 --> 00:08.434
<i>But what they don't know</i>

00:08.502 --> 00:11.323
<i>is that the Jackal's headquarters
was directly underneath it.</i>

00:11.651 --> 00:14.455
<i>We destroyed it before he could create
his spider army.</i>

00:14.525 --> 00:17.549
<i>But not without a casualty...
Norman Osborne.</i>

00:17.768 --> 00:20.854
<i>Harry's devastated, and there's
nothing I can do to comfort him,</i>

00:20.979 --> 00:22.877
<i>because he blames Spider-Man.</i>

00:23.002 --> 00:25.799
<i>Seeing what these spider powers
can do firsthand,</i>

00:25.916 --> 00:29.565
<i>I don't think a whole army of
rogue spider-men is a good idea.</i>

00:29.768 --> 00:34.385
<i>That would mean new spider-powered
people, new costumes,</i>

00:34.655 --> 00:37.969
<i>new abilities,
and definitely new threats.</i>

00:39.241 --> 00:42.335
<i>Which is why I need 
new ways to find the Jackal.</i>

00:42.524 --> 00:43.930
<i>Gotcha!</i>

00:44.002 --> 00:47.908
Aw, man! I was so close.
What gave me away?

00:47.976 --> 00:50.502
Well, the mirage reflectors
in your new stealth suit

00:50.570 --> 00:52.346
seem to have a short in them.

00:52.634 --> 00:55.932
But to be honest, I could hear
you chatting a mile away.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.057
You gotta stop talking
to yourself so much.

00:58.182 --> 00:59.729
Wha...

00:59.797 --> 01:01.494
I don't talk to myself.

01:01.690 --> 01:04.197
Yeah.
I'd look into that.

01:04.518 --> 01:08.276
Anyway, I didn't come this close
to be denied my prize.

01:08.344 --> 01:10.432
- Oh, I'm starving.
- Wait! I also...

01:12.256 --> 01:15.033
You rigged the cupcake?
Ugh!

01:15.175 --> 01:16.971
<i>Security activated.</i>

01:17.479 --> 01:19.744
I'm guessing you programmed
your security bots

01:19.812 --> 01:23.752
- to recognize Spider-Man, right?
- Uh, Spider-Man, yes.

01:24.026 --> 01:26.502
Stealth Spider, no.

01:26.658 --> 01:28.783
<i>Prepare to be destroyed.</i>

01:28.885 --> 01:30.603
I just lost my appetite.

01:41.996 --> 01:44.433
I tried to take him offline,
but it didn't work.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.956
So I suggest you run!

01:52.128 --> 01:55.432
Great!
This is the perfect time

01:55.514 --> 01:57.688
for the stealth suit's
reflectors to be malfunctioning.

01:57.756 --> 02:01.155
Time to take this outside before we
destroy any more school property.

02:03.167 --> 02:05.545
This suit was supposed
to make me invisible,

02:05.615 --> 02:07.646
not attractive to security bots!

02:07.865 --> 02:10.895
Whoa! I have to find a
place to get it off me.

02:16.239 --> 02:18.092
<i>Scanning for subject.</i>

02:19.560 --> 02:22.920
<i>Parker, Peter,
Horizon High student.</i>

02:26.842 --> 02:29.873
- You okay?
- "Run," he says.

02:29.967 --> 02:32.190
Well, at least we found out
the suit is flawed

02:32.258 --> 02:34.128
before you went out
into the field.

02:34.303 --> 02:37.026
- But what went wrong?
- I messed up.

02:37.331 --> 02:40.433
I added thermal-suppressor tech
to cover my body temperature,

02:40.646 --> 02:43.308
but I didn't account for the
extra heat the suit creates.

02:43.714 --> 02:47.224
- In other words?
- My sweat short-circuited the suit.

02:47.979 --> 02:49.659
So now it's trash.

02:51.683 --> 02:53.604
Stealth suit no more.

02:56.003 --> 02:57.347
Oh, what am I doing?

02:57.415 --> 02:59.831
I can't just throw out
a Spider-Man costume.

03:00.604 --> 03:02.597
That's incredibly irresponsible.

03:09.256 --> 03:12.568
Come on, Dad.
What's the code?

03:12.904 --> 03:16.367
The Jackal is still out there, and
if I can access your video journal,

03:16.435 --> 03:19.289
maybe I can continue
your work to stop him.

03:25.865 --> 03:28.357
You, uh...
You all right, Harry?

03:28.756 --> 03:32.365
Oh, yeah. Um, just
some computer trouble.

03:32.638 --> 03:36.695
Oh. Well, listen, uh,
I wanted you to know how sorry I was

03:36.763 --> 03:40.529
- to hear about your dad's passing.
- Thanks, Joe.

03:41.123 --> 03:45.216
- Pete joining you today?
- No.

03:45.388 --> 03:48.888
Well, anyway,
this one's on the house.

03:49.162 --> 03:50.787
I appreciate it.

04:03.297 --> 04:05.469
I'm ready for that smoothie.

04:06.290 --> 04:08.492
- Hey, Harry.
- Not talking to you.

04:08.591 --> 04:11.058
I know. I just wanted to say that...

04:11.235 --> 04:13.367
If you know, then you'll stop talking.

04:14.008 --> 04:18.286
I'm not friends with people who
help Spider-Man. Leave me alone.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.568
Why am I always paying the price
for Spider-Man's actions?

04:24.664 --> 04:27.139
You were at school
pretty early for a Saturday.

04:27.701 --> 04:31.561
Oh, Gwen. Hi.
Uh, how do you know?

04:31.678 --> 04:34.889
I was working in my lab.
Thought I heard your voice.

04:35.022 --> 04:37.982
Really?
Uh, what did you hear?

04:38.209 --> 04:41.952
Not much. I had to leave
to pick up some samples

04:42.039 --> 04:43.730
I sent out for testing.

04:44.988 --> 04:46.652
- Hey, Gwen.
- Hey!

04:46.968 --> 04:51.003
Uh, Pete, have you been feeling
different

04:51.073 --> 04:53.706
in any way since our time
at the Jackal's headquarters?

04:54.214 --> 04:55.386
Different?

04:55.784 --> 04:59.159
Uh... no.
Why?

04:59.761 --> 05:00.891
No reason.

05:01.284 --> 05:03.933
I... I gotta go.

05:05.667 --> 05:07.522
Huh.
That was weird.

05:08.074 --> 05:10.324
I wonder if she knows
what we were doing this morning.

05:13.589 --> 05:16.110
- Where's my backpack?
- I thought you had it.

05:16.441 --> 05:19.488
No.
I left it at the table with you!

05:19.581 --> 05:21.144
The stealth suit was in there.

05:21.261 --> 05:23.027
Oh, you should've told me.

05:23.847 --> 05:26.386
- Harry's gone.
- So is Gwen.

05:27.144 --> 05:29.540
But they wouldn't take my...
Would they?

05:29.659 --> 05:31.621
Gwen was acting weird.

05:32.659 --> 05:35.040
And Harry's pretty mad
at me right now.

05:36.097 --> 05:39.185
What are we doing?
These are our friends.

05:40.831 --> 05:43.988
- Can you track it with a GPS?
- Maybe.

05:44.191 --> 05:47.714
But it was a beta version.
I-I never tested it outside the lab.

05:47.847 --> 05:51.621
So it's, like, really gone,
not just invisible gone.

05:52.033 --> 05:55.402
'Cause while it was supposed to be
stealth, it is now also stolen.

05:55.659 --> 05:57.324
Yeah. I get it.

05:57.511 --> 06:00.011
I'm gonna head back to Horizon
and see if I can track it.

06:00.175 --> 06:02.238
I'll see what I can find
around here.

06:04.561 --> 06:05.749
Nothing.

06:06.017 --> 06:07.763
It's like
your broken stealth suit

06:07.831 --> 06:09.571
was wearing a working
stealth suit.

06:09.658 --> 06:12.633
- Any luck on your end?
- No.

06:12.701 --> 06:14.306
The homing device
must've shorted out

06:14.374 --> 06:16.720
- when the suit did.
- That's not good.

06:16.931 --> 06:19.743
- I better keep looking.
- I'll scan again.

06:19.962 --> 06:22.590
I made the suit out of the silk
of a garden center spider,

06:22.677 --> 06:25.399
which gives off a
distinct electric charge.

06:25.519 --> 06:29.149
So if I limit the search to that polarity,
I might get something.

06:30.149 --> 06:31.259
Huh?

06:33.814 --> 06:36.853
Miles?
Is that you?

06:37.907 --> 06:39.556
Miles?

06:46.392 --> 06:48.667
First the symbiote,
and now the stealth suit?

06:48.735 --> 06:52.036
Why do all my costumes come
back looking for a fight?

06:53.204 --> 06:57.361
Whoever you are, I see
you fixed the deflectors on the suit.

06:58.550 --> 07:00.838
But are you smart enough
to defeat...

07:01.416 --> 07:03.260
my cupcake?

07:04.382 --> 07:07.408
<i>Intruder!
Prepare to be destroyed!</i>

07:09.130 --> 07:11.685
<i>Infrared on.</i>

07:15.140 --> 07:18.758
Let's hope you didn't repair
all the suit's problems.

07:19.101 --> 07:21.651
Excellent!
Your increased body temperature

07:21.746 --> 07:23.262
is allowing me to get a heat
read.

07:23.341 --> 07:26.484
And besides stealing my costume,
you've also stolen my powers.

07:26.559 --> 07:28.320
So who are you?

07:34.306 --> 07:36.000
Looking for me?

07:47.750 --> 07:51.336
The Micro-minimizer?
That's what you've been looking for?

07:51.404 --> 07:54.461
Well, you're gonna have to deal
with Spidey and the patent office,

07:54.679 --> 07:57.265
because that's an official
Horizon High design.

07:57.333 --> 08:00.236
Just like my tracer is
an official Spider-Man design.

08:00.474 --> 08:02.039
Gotcha!

08:06.703 --> 08:10.617
That's odd. Didn't know Gwen was
conducting any spider experiments.

08:10.703 --> 08:13.304
Wait a minute. She asked
if I was feeling different

08:13.393 --> 08:15.133
since our time
at Jackal's headquarters.

08:15.207 --> 08:18.562
What if Gwen was somehow bitten by
one of the spiders there that day?

08:18.694 --> 08:20.726
She could've turned
into the Stealth Spider!

08:21.187 --> 08:22.970
That doesn't make any sense.

08:23.679 --> 08:27.148
Why break into Horizon when you
have complete access as a student?

08:27.216 --> 08:28.953
And why head to Osborn Academy?

08:29.058 --> 08:31.406
Miles, I found the suit.

08:31.617 --> 08:33.140
Finally. Where is it?

08:33.275 --> 08:37.047
- On someone heading for Osborn Academy.
- So it is Harry.

08:37.133 --> 08:40.054
Let's not jump to conclusions.
Just meet me there.

08:43.461 --> 08:45.726
Yes! Finally!

08:47.313 --> 08:50.734
<i>Personal Log Number 417:</i>

08:50.941 --> 08:53.937
<i>Raymond Warren
is amassing a spider army.</i>

08:54.072 --> 08:58.461
<i>It's a danger to humanity that
must be stopped, at all costs.</i>

08:58.621 --> 09:02.239
<i>In here are the blueprints for
a plan to neutralize that army.</i>

09:02.365 --> 09:04.690
<i>And for anyone who doubts
the army's existence,</i>

09:04.758 --> 09:07.380
<i>look no further than
the menace of Spider-Man.</i>

09:07.656 --> 09:10.664
<i>Mark my words,
more spiders will come.</i>

09:11.383 --> 09:13.703
<i>And they must be stopped.</i>

09:13.875 --> 09:18.000
You were right, Dad.
And you did stop them.

09:18.312 --> 09:19.718
With your life.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.148
But I promise you, I'm not gonna
let the Jackal try again.

09:24.328 --> 09:26.375
I'll take down
all the spider-men,

09:26.586 --> 09:28.804
now that I have the means.

09:33.914 --> 09:35.492
Spider-Man!

09:35.630 --> 09:38.429
Oh, you picked
a bad time to trespass!

09:39.898 --> 09:43.664
According to this,
the Stealth Spider is inside.

09:43.961 --> 09:45.883
And there's no sign of forced entry.

09:46.163 --> 09:49.653
Why would there be,
when Harry has keys to the kingdom?

09:49.816 --> 09:51.869
I'm afraid you might be right.

09:58.614 --> 10:00.192
Switch to thermal vision.

10:00.260 --> 10:02.976
We should be able to see him because
of the suit's body temp issues.

10:03.044 --> 10:06.559
Switching to thermal.
Also, I'll show him some stealth.

10:07.945 --> 10:09.508
There!

10:09.684 --> 10:11.786
Give it up, Harry!
I know it's you!

10:11.854 --> 10:15.919
- Hold it right there, Spider-Man!
- Harry?

10:16.317 --> 10:18.802
But if you didn't steal the
stealth suit...

10:18.870 --> 10:20.559
No more time for guessing!

10:26.520 --> 10:29.048
A new spider soldier?

10:29.135 --> 10:31.606
So my father didn't stop the
Jackal's army from from growing.

10:31.770 --> 10:34.075
Well, I will! For good!

10:34.143 --> 10:37.419
Harry, wait! Can't say
that came as a shock.

10:38.265 --> 10:40.661
I'm taking all the spiders down today!

10:40.771 --> 10:42.872
And I don't care who's first!

10:43.475 --> 10:46.110
You know kids shouldn't
play with matches,

10:46.197 --> 10:48.786
let alone full-on flame swords.

10:52.825 --> 10:56.384
Get Harry down
while I take this guy out.

10:56.778 --> 11:00.403
Priorities, boss.
We'll take this guy out together.

11:01.354 --> 11:03.997
The priority is don't get roasted!

11:09.756 --> 11:11.709
Hiya, boys!

11:12.733 --> 11:14.481
Need some backup?

11:14.985 --> 11:16.850
Gwen Stacy with spider powers?

11:16.918 --> 11:18.882
Is there something
you've been meaning to tell us?

11:18.950 --> 11:23.353
- Uh, guys, stay focused.
- Hey! Let go of him, you weirdo!

11:25.242 --> 11:27.258
That's not what I meant!

11:27.407 --> 11:31.219
Wait for me!
I did not think this through.

11:45.654 --> 11:48.123
Don't forget to curb
your dog, ma'am.

11:50.076 --> 11:52.896
I don't care
that you saved my life!

11:52.998 --> 11:55.748
You should've saved
my dad's life at Midtown!

11:55.816 --> 11:58.451
Harry! How can you
say such a thing?

11:58.553 --> 12:01.513
And how long have you
had spider powers?

12:02.032 --> 12:03.959
Excellent question.

12:04.084 --> 12:07.881
Is everybody around here a member
of Jackal's spider army?

12:08.162 --> 12:10.281
Harry, just because
someone has spider powers

12:10.349 --> 12:12.631
doesn't mean they're part
of a spider army.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.802
That is probably the weirdest
thing I've ever said.

12:16.295 --> 12:19.818
The truth is, I don't know
how I got spider powers.

12:19.905 --> 12:22.613
But I promise you,
I don't work for the Jackal.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.599
- You've gotta trust me.
- I've always trusted you, Gwen.

12:25.693 --> 12:27.974
It's these guys I don't trust!

12:28.052 --> 12:30.998
Harry, they were fighting
that maniac as hard as I was.

12:31.091 --> 12:33.873
You've gotta get over
this hatred of Spider-Man.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.439
My dad is dead because of him!

12:37.568 --> 12:40.412
No, Harry.
That's not how it happened.

12:40.614 --> 12:43.513
I was there, too, remember?
I saw it.

12:43.787 --> 12:47.663
You've gotta know Spider-Man did
all he could to save you both.

12:48.244 --> 12:49.906
And I know
you're hurting right now,

12:49.974 --> 12:53.076
but... we were all affected
by that explosion.

12:53.271 --> 12:56.943
I lost my uncle.
Th-The city lost a school.

12:57.420 --> 13:00.013
Wait. Gwen's right.

13:00.177 --> 13:02.545
We were all affected
by that explosion.

13:02.834 --> 13:05.477
Do you think
you got spider powers

13:05.545 --> 13:08.498
by being too close to the
experiment when it exploded?

13:08.677 --> 13:11.352
I've run a number of tests
on myself, and since I wasn't

13:11.420 --> 13:13.927
bitten by a spider the
way you told me you were,

13:14.146 --> 13:16.545
it does make the most sense.

13:16.802 --> 13:19.271
Then why don't
I have spider powers?

13:19.381 --> 13:22.357
You were wearing that mask
the day of the explosion.

13:22.576 --> 13:24.716
Maybe it protected you somehow.

13:25.045 --> 13:27.391
But that doesn't explain
the new guy.

13:27.459 --> 13:28.774
Where'd he get spider powers from?

13:28.841 --> 13:31.607
- Is he a member of Jackal's army?
- I don't know.

13:32.154 --> 13:34.787
But I sure could use
your help in finding out.

13:37.201 --> 13:38.607
Okay.

13:40.271 --> 13:44.201
But the mask stays on,
just in case you're contagious.

13:44.388 --> 13:47.141
Thank you. I'm running
a scan of my tracer,

13:47.209 --> 13:49.560
but it must've shorted out
when the suit was fried.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.828
We'll need to find
a new way of tracking him.

13:51.896 --> 13:54.129
I found a piece of his
suit that must've got caught

13:54.216 --> 13:57.373
on the glass when he escaped.
I'll scan it for clues.

13:57.555 --> 13:59.732
<i>The suit is made
of a charged spider silk</i>

13:59.888 --> 14:02.131
<i>that gives off
an electromagnetic field.</i>

14:02.365 --> 14:04.826
Similar to those used
in cell phone towers.

14:05.029 --> 14:06.592
By triangulating
his energy field

14:06.660 --> 14:09.115
against various cell towers
across the city,

14:09.224 --> 14:11.424
I can tell exactly
where he's going.

14:11.511 --> 14:14.607
Cell phone towers!
Of course!

14:14.696 --> 14:17.466
I could've used you 12 hours ago
when I first lost the suit.

14:17.615 --> 14:18.852
Where's he headed?

14:18.947 --> 14:23.060
Uh, he's headed to...
Liberty Island.

14:23.228 --> 14:25.193
- Great.
- Yeah.

14:25.341 --> 14:27.537
But what's not so great
is what he stole.

14:27.631 --> 14:30.420
I just ran an inventory
of the chemicals in the lab,

14:30.488 --> 14:32.724
and a number of toxic
dioxins are missing.

14:32.841 --> 14:34.349
Thanks, Harry.

14:34.678 --> 14:37.383
Harry says Stealth Spider
stole a bunch of poisons.

14:37.451 --> 14:40.029
That could explain why
he stole the Micro-minimizer.

14:40.097 --> 14:42.857
It can convert liquid
into microscopic particles

14:42.925 --> 14:45.099
that enable them
to become airborne.

14:45.326 --> 14:47.006
Combined with
the deadly toxins,

14:47.074 --> 14:50.295
he could feasibly disperse
a poisonous gas over the entire city.

14:50.825 --> 14:52.466
It's Harry again.

14:52.638 --> 14:56.162
<i>- What else you got for us?
- Uh, Pete, what are you talking about?</i>

14:56.230 --> 14:57.726
Ugh, wrong phone.

14:57.845 --> 15:01.709
Uh, hi, Harry.
I was, uh, j-just talking to someone else.

15:01.777 --> 15:04.170
Nothing important.
How... How are you?

15:04.341 --> 15:06.813
Not great, to be honest.
But I feel like

15:06.881 --> 15:08.405
I've been taking it out
on the wrong people,

15:08.472 --> 15:09.974
which is why I'm calling.

15:10.287 --> 15:11.935
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

15:12.084 --> 15:15.248
For overreacting about your
relationship with Spider-Man.

15:15.316 --> 15:17.826
He saved my life today.
And, well,

15:17.958 --> 15:20.802
Gwen helped me realize
that he isn't the enemy.

15:21.146 --> 15:26.232
So I was thinking... maybe
we can be friends again too?

15:27.404 --> 15:29.248
That makes me really happy,
Harry.

15:29.427 --> 15:32.341
Me too.
I'll call you later.

15:35.896 --> 15:39.177
Sorry. Harry was just
telling us to be careful.

15:39.685 --> 15:42.250
Did he also tell us how to get
to the Statue of Liberty?

15:42.318 --> 15:45.646
I mean, the ferry isn't exactly the
best choice for a sneak attack.

15:45.732 --> 15:48.194
- Oh, we've got a better way.
- No. No!

15:48.281 --> 15:50.068
Wait! Guys, I'm new at this!

15:50.136 --> 15:51.865
I'm not ready to...

15:52.059 --> 15:53.642
Relax. You're safe.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.945
I love that you think I'm
safe when a crazy spider person

15:57.013 --> 15:59.633
has escaped with enough
chemicals to poison the city.

15:59.701 --> 16:02.134
Well, lucky for
us, that crazy spider person

16:02.221 --> 16:04.607
is right up ahead at our 2:00.

16:06.372 --> 16:10.191
If you can get me in closer, I
think I can strike the first blow.

16:10.259 --> 16:12.974
But you don't have web wings.
You sure you're up for this?

16:13.042 --> 16:15.107
My friend Peter Parker
has a saying.

16:15.251 --> 16:18.310
"With great power comes
great responsibility."

16:18.401 --> 16:20.529
I think it fits the occasion.

16:28.935 --> 16:32.451
The tanks are on a launch timer.
I'll work on shutting them down.

16:43.318 --> 16:45.139
Oh, come on, Miles.

16:45.207 --> 16:48.443
Treat this like a test.
But if you get it wrong,

16:48.511 --> 16:51.529
you don't fail,
you just poison the entire city.

16:52.574 --> 16:54.256
I've got him!

16:58.780 --> 17:01.538
Where is he?
Where is he?

17:02.680 --> 17:06.760
Got him!
Here's web in your eye!

17:14.608 --> 17:18.211
Can't stop it. The timer has
multiple layers of encryption.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.152
We've only got 45 seconds left.

17:20.220 --> 17:21.522
Forty-five seconds?

17:21.590 --> 17:24.954
That should leave me ten whole
seconds for a curtain call.

17:30.977 --> 17:34.455
This looks like an
asymmetrical encryption code. Easy.

17:36.781 --> 17:37.949
Uh-oh.

17:38.078 --> 17:42.679
Unless it's merely disguised as
an asymmetrical encryption code.

17:45.522 --> 17:47.666
Aahh!

17:58.505 --> 18:00.018
Okay, Gwen.

18:00.086 --> 18:02.417
All the spider powers in the
world aren't gonna help

18:02.485 --> 18:04.828
if your brain can't figure this out.

18:06.344 --> 18:09.555
Let's try
a nonsequential algorithm.

18:18.694 --> 18:21.257
<i>Launch sequence terminated.</i>

18:21.467 --> 18:26.608
Yes! Spider-Gwen got me here,
but regular Gwen saves the day!

18:26.800 --> 18:28.288
Whoo-hoo!

18:37.027 --> 18:41.934
I got your back. Now show this
imposter who the real Spider-Man is!

18:49.003 --> 18:52.661
- Game's over, Miss Muffet.
- Why'd you call him that?

18:52.736 --> 18:57.134
'Cause along came a spider,
you've worked alongside her...

19:01.597 --> 19:03.607
And beat
the Stealth Spider away!

19:03.675 --> 19:04.912
Yeah!

19:04.980 --> 19:07.293
Making nursery rhymes
cool again.

19:11.492 --> 19:14.944
And now to find out
who you really are.

19:20.521 --> 19:22.170
- Ugh!
- Eww!

19:22.238 --> 19:24.912
And that's gonna
give me nightmares.

19:34.494 --> 19:36.637
Uh-oh!
He damaged the news copter.

19:36.705 --> 19:39.401
I'm on it!
My first copter rescue.

19:43.574 --> 19:47.252
Hang on, folks!
Help has arrived.

19:54.194 --> 19:58.244
Great work, you two.
But that monster got away.

20:02.876 --> 20:05.534
I still can't believe you
have spider powers, Gwen.

20:05.744 --> 20:07.278
Wish I was there to see it.

20:07.365 --> 20:10.618
You should've turned on the TV.
It was all over the news.

20:10.832 --> 20:14.412
Really? So everyone saw Spider-Man
and friends saving the city?

20:14.492 --> 20:16.890
<i>Spider-Gwen!
Spider-Gwen!</i>

20:16.958 --> 20:20.846
<i>Spider-Gwen! Spider-Gwen!
Spider-Gwen!</i>

20:20.914 --> 20:22.484
<i>Spider-Gwen!</i>

20:22.552 --> 20:26.371
Well, they saw someone
saving the city.

20:26.851 --> 20:29.535
Tell me again why we keep
our identities a secret.

20:31.457 --> 20:32.850
I'm just glad my spider powers

20:32.918 --> 20:35.731
actually helped my relationship
with Harry for a change.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.660
<i>Can you sign this for me?</i>

20:43.959 --> 20:46.820
Careful!
The grate's breaking!

20:54.445 --> 20:56.234
- Come on.
- Here.

20:58.500 --> 21:01.702
You just...
Bu... But h-how...

21:01.976 --> 21:04.850
You're 
Spider-Man?!

21:06.914 --> 21:09.046
No. No, Harry, listen, I...

21:09.176 --> 21:11.765
I must've been exposed
to the spider virus too.

21:13.226 --> 21:15.585
You were long gone
by the time it exploded.

21:15.679 --> 21:17.820
I can't believe
you kept this from me!

21:28.014 --> 21:30.875
I think the spider virus
is airborne.
