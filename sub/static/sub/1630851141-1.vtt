01:06.501 --> 01:09.102
But the day of the
Lord will come like a thief.

01:11.204 --> 01:13.106
The heavens will
disappear with a roar.

01:15.175 --> 01:17.110
The elements will be
destroyed by a fire.

01:18.746 --> 01:23.216
And the earth and everything
done in it will be laid bare.

03:30.945 --> 03:35.950
Oh Cole, your grandfather
had a real upset last night.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.619
Here, sit down, sit down.

03:40.287 --> 03:41.989
I got it, go sit down.

03:47.662 --> 03:49.931
This is just
getting to be too much.

03:55.970 --> 03:56.970
He asleep?

03:58.506 --> 04:00.007
Praise it be.

04:12.587 --> 04:13.955
I'll check in later today.

04:17.058 --> 04:18.391
Thank you son.

04:19.794 --> 04:20.928
Thank you.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.993
All right, squeeze my
hand, squeeze my hand.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.529
You sleep good?

05:51.052 --> 05:52.086
Hey.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.119
Oh hey, Ellen.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.927
Please see to Davis.

05:59.961 --> 06:01.996
He won't listen to us anymore.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.029
Yes ma'am.

06:05.465 --> 06:07.802
Really, take it easy.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.402
How about we try this?

06:10.605 --> 06:11.973
You like pudding, don't you?

06:13.941 --> 06:15.442
Yeah, but-

06:15.475 --> 06:16.875
- Yeah, you see
this lid right here?

06:17.745 --> 06:19.113
Yeah.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.626
This means they
didn't contaminate it.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.585
It's safe.

06:24.619 --> 06:25.987
That proves
it, the lid proves it?

06:26.020 --> 06:27.054
It proves it.

06:27.088 --> 06:28.990
One, two, three.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.895
Anything happen?

06:33.928 --> 06:35.596
No, not yet.

06:35.630 --> 06:37.164
All right, you want to try it?

06:37.198 --> 06:38.431
Just a little bit.

06:38.465 --> 06:39.567
Just a little bit.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.640
You gotta trust me though,
look at me, you trust me?

06:44.605 --> 06:46.073
You hungry?

06:46.107 --> 06:47.942
Yeah.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.586
I ain't supposed
to eat dessert before dinner.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.411
That's all right,
there's no rules here.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.120
Hey, Cole.

06:59.153 --> 07:00.554
Hey, Randy.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.089
Ellen almost through?

07:02.123 --> 07:03.123
Ah, yeah.

07:04.225 --> 07:08.796
Hey, I hear congratulations
are in order.

07:08.829 --> 07:09.829
Thank you.

07:10.765 --> 07:12.767
Yeah, you gotta
lock down the goods.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.901
Yeah, you do.

07:15.069 --> 07:16.604
You still seeing
the Carson girl?

07:17.772 --> 07:20.074
- I am.
- Always liked that girl.

07:21.676 --> 07:24.011
I mean, you got
yourself a good one too.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.114
I hear what you're saying.

07:28.249 --> 07:29.550
See you later.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.985
See you.

08:06.554 --> 08:07.755
Are you working tonight?

08:08.856 --> 08:10.057
Night shift.

08:10.091 --> 08:11.859
Night shift?

08:11.892 --> 08:12.892
No night shift, no.

08:14.595 --> 08:17.565
Don't look at me like
that, we don't have time.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.273
That me making your
heart beat so fast?

08:26.307 --> 08:27.508
Sometimes.

08:29.844 --> 08:30.845
It's nice.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.653
I got a new manager.

08:42.623 --> 08:43.623
Guess who.

08:45.126 --> 08:46.527
You won't believe who it is.

08:50.664 --> 08:51.665
You ain't curious?

08:51.699 --> 08:52.699
No.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.201
No?

08:54.235 --> 08:55.235
No.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.772
Fine.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.148
Come on, baby,
don't you feel that?

09:08.749 --> 09:10.051
I don't feel a thing, darling.

09:12.153 --> 09:15.623
- Feel this?
- No, do you feel this?

09:50.424 --> 09:52.693
Should have been here, man!

09:52.726 --> 09:54.361
Was it a good time.

09:54.395 --> 09:56.130
Yeah, looks it.

09:56.163 --> 10:00.868
Bless old Ruthie's heart
though, she don't hear a thing.

10:01.836 --> 10:04.705
Hey, I'm good to her,
and I'm good to you.

10:10.678 --> 10:14.381
I don't see why you don't
just take from that home though.

10:14.415 --> 10:16.684
They got pills coming
out their eyeballs.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.789
I'm not gonna take from
those people, you know that.

10:21.822 --> 10:24.859
"I'm not gonna take from
those people, you know that."

10:25.960 --> 10:27.261
You are such a choir boy.

10:28.863 --> 10:30.231
Today's your lucky day though,

10:30.264 --> 10:32.032
we're lousy with oxy this month.

10:34.168 --> 10:35.970
You sure Ruthie
don't need these?

10:36.003 --> 10:38.339
Yes I'm sure, Ruthie,
don't need those.

10:38.372 --> 10:41.242
We got scripts from
four different docs.

10:41.275 --> 10:42.275
We're good.

10:44.445 --> 10:45.646
Thank you very much.

10:46.814 --> 10:47.814
Well, looky, looky.

10:50.184 --> 10:51.118
Come on, get you some.

10:51.152 --> 10:51.952
No, I'm good.

10:51.986 --> 10:52.986
You're good?

10:54.121 --> 10:55.122
No.

10:55.156 --> 10:56.157
I'm okay.

10:56.190 --> 10:57.291
When'd you quit?

10:57.992 --> 10:59.059
I never started.

11:01.095 --> 11:02.205
It was a good fucking party.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.998
I keep hearing that.

11:04.031 --> 11:06.066
Yeah, I throw good fucking
parties, what can I say?

11:08.102 --> 11:09.069
Hey buddy.

11:09.103 --> 11:09.904
Hey.

11:09.937 --> 11:10.738
Good to see.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.139
You too.

11:12.173 --> 11:13.207
We're good?

11:13.240 --> 11:14.108
Yeah, I'm good, you good?

11:14.141 --> 11:15.376
Yeah, I am now.

11:15.409 --> 11:16.343
All right, take care.

11:16.377 --> 11:17.377
Okay.

11:29.056 --> 11:30.056
Evening, doc.

11:32.426 --> 11:33.861
Everett.

12:00.487 --> 12:03.224
Clyde always was a character.

12:03.257 --> 12:04.892
You give him my best

12:04.925 --> 12:07.294
and y'all just let me
know what you decide.

12:07.328 --> 12:09.964
- We will.
- Evening, ladies.

12:12.567 --> 12:13.567
Howdy.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.143
Did I miss something?

12:23.177 --> 12:26.146
No, the girls just
came by for a visit.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.248
Check on daddy.

12:27.281 --> 12:28.816
Yeah, he's worse, you know.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.887
What did he want?

12:33.921 --> 12:36.190
Now Cole, don't get upset, but-

12:36.223 --> 12:37.559
- We need to make sure

12:37.592 --> 12:39.527
that mama and daddy
are provided for.

12:39.561 --> 12:42.162
These revelation movers
aren't gonna last forever.

12:42.196 --> 12:45.899
And there ain't no retirement
plans for country preachers.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.334
I take good care of them.

12:47.368 --> 12:49.036
He does, he takes
very good care of us.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.938
But it ain't his land, mama.

12:51.205 --> 12:52.106
It's ours.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.139
Ours and his mama.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.079
Well, she ain't here, is she?

13:07.121 --> 13:08.222
Why couldn't you just

13:08.255 --> 13:10.224
be a little more
gentle with him?

13:10.257 --> 13:14.461
Sorry, but
someones gotta say something.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.067
Angels.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.472
Angels and vultures.

13:29.076 --> 13:30.076
Can't rest.

13:32.146 --> 13:35.082
Can't rest with them
birds squawking around.

13:39.353 --> 13:41.188
Peck at you, peck, peck, peck.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.224
Peck till there's nothing left.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.102
And I hear you thinking,

13:57.071 --> 14:01.108
now that the kingdom of
heaven is so close.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.416
Slow down.

14:09.450 --> 14:11.085
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.320
Slow down.

14:16.524 --> 14:17.524
That's right.

14:18.325 --> 14:21.028
- Oh Lord.
- That's right.

14:21.061 --> 14:24.599
Thessalonians 4:16.

14:31.939 --> 14:34.174
For the Lord himself
will come down from heaven

14:35.610 --> 14:37.010
with a loud command,

14:39.246 --> 14:41.014
with the voice of the archangel

14:43.217 --> 14:44.885
and with the
trumpet call of God,

14:47.522 --> 14:49.123
and the dead in Christ
will rise first.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.294
Hallelujah.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.944
I appreciate it, Kelly.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.956
Terry Rose,
as I live and breathe!

15:22.990 --> 15:25.492
Oh come here,
you skinny son of a bitch.

15:25.527 --> 15:27.662
Last time I saw you I
get my hands on you.

15:27.695 --> 15:28.495
What's good, man?

15:28.530 --> 15:30.130
You good?

15:30.164 --> 15:31.474
Yeah, I'm doing all
right man, I'm pretty good.

15:31.498 --> 15:32.510
I'll talk to you
later, all right?

15:32.534 --> 15:33.400
Yeah okay.

15:33.434 --> 15:34.468
Good to see you.

15:34.502 --> 15:36.103
Yeah, good to see you.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.971
Cole Freeman, that you?

15:39.306 --> 15:41.108
Almost didn't recognize
you in the getup.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.309
Wow.

15:44.178 --> 15:46.113
It's a good disguise I guess.

15:47.749 --> 15:49.216
You in need of hiding?

15:52.019 --> 15:53.153
Hey, Kathy.

15:53.187 --> 15:54.221
Hey Cole.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.422
It's good to see you.

15:55.456 --> 15:56.490
You too.

15:56.524 --> 15:58.091
You a doctor or something?

15:59.293 --> 16:02.062
I'm just like an
aide over at Beverly.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.430
No shit?

16:03.464 --> 16:06.133
I always knew you were
destined for greatness.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.369
Beats this getup, right?

16:09.403 --> 16:10.471
It's a job.

16:11.739 --> 16:13.340
Been back a couple weeks,

16:13.373 --> 16:15.108
lost my job over there
in Campbell County.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.645
Times are tough you know.

16:17.679 --> 16:20.615
Excuse me, beauty, can
we have some menus?

16:20.648 --> 16:22.349
Right away, Mr. Rose.

16:23.317 --> 16:26.019
Mr. Rose, it is nice being home.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.354
We're living with my folks.

16:28.489 --> 16:29.724
Okay.

16:29.757 --> 16:31.492
Nothing like sneaking
carnal relations

16:31.526 --> 16:33.486
to bring you back to your
high school days, right?

16:38.332 --> 16:40.735
Speaking of, I heard you're
seeing Charlotte Carson.

16:42.570 --> 16:43.570
I am.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.673
You know she works for me now.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.308
She was a wild little thing
when we were together.

16:48.342 --> 16:50.110
Yeah, well that
was a long time ago.

16:51.078 --> 16:52.379
She's been with chicks, bro.

16:55.683 --> 16:57.050
Good seeing you, man.

16:57.819 --> 16:59.253
I gotta get back to work.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.121
Hey, hold up, partner.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.332
Might you be holding anything?

17:02.356 --> 17:03.257
What?

17:03.290 --> 17:04.568
Charlotte said you
could maybe hook me-

17:04.592 --> 17:05.527
- I gotta go.

17:05.560 --> 17:06.694
Get the fuck outside.

17:06.895 --> 17:09.329
Oh, little Jodie Hampton.

17:09.363 --> 17:10.698
Oooh.

17:10.732 --> 17:12.567
You got something on
the side with her?

17:13.668 --> 17:15.503
Times have changed, brother.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.108
He don't need to know
where we're staying.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.645
You didn't
need to lose your job.

17:23.678 --> 17:28.282
You can't follow the rules,
you find somebody else, okay?

17:28.315 --> 17:29.325
I just need something small.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.151
This isn't how it works.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.184
Small's all I need.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.725
Don't make me go to Everett.

17:47.602 --> 17:49.102
Get the fuck outta here.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.140
Fuck.

18:02.517 --> 18:03.585
You good?

18:03.618 --> 18:04.618
Here we go.

18:07.655 --> 18:09.524
How's your day today?

18:09.557 --> 18:11.358
Your day good?

18:11.391 --> 18:12.391
Yeah?

18:14.361 --> 18:15.429
There you go.

18:15.462 --> 18:16.496
How you doing today?

18:17.665 --> 18:19.199
I'm good.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.367
The remote?

18:20.400 --> 18:21.769
You want the remote?

18:24.539 --> 18:25.506
There you go.

18:25.540 --> 18:26.340
Thank you.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.373
Yeah.

18:42.356 --> 18:43.925
Come on.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.763
Fuck.

18:48.796 --> 18:50.230
Shut up.

18:52.499 --> 18:53.868
What a piece of shit.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.838
You should buy the new Tahoe.

18:56.871 --> 18:58.773
Oh yeah, you think I'm rich?

19:00.240 --> 19:01.518
You could you
use that same money

19:01.542 --> 19:03.276
and finally get
out of this place?

19:03.310 --> 19:04.712
Yeah?

19:04.746 --> 19:07.180
I got friends in New
York and Cleveland.

19:07.214 --> 19:08.281
I could set us up.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.917
Ah, you're high.

19:09.951 --> 19:12.452
Nope, but on my way, baby.

19:14.388 --> 19:15.489
Appreciate the pick me up.

19:17.224 --> 19:18.526
I wish you'd stick to booze.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.330
We all want something.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.671
My new boss and I were talking.

19:29.704 --> 19:30.772
Yeah, I know.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.710
I told you not to talk about
my business with people.

19:37.645 --> 19:39.179
Terry Rose ain't people.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.388
Come on, Cole.

19:51.826 --> 19:54.261
All girls pick the wrong
guys when they're young.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.331
The smart ones right their ways.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.705
I thought you'd be tickled
your old buddy's back.

20:17.885 --> 20:19.987
Either way, Terry Rose
is the only person

20:20.021 --> 20:21.288
thinking big around here.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.593
You should hear him out.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.395
Yeah, I got enough problems.

20:32.399 --> 20:33.735
Yes.

20:43.911 --> 20:45.445
Here.

21:06.968 --> 21:07.735
Hey.

21:07.769 --> 21:09.369
Hey.

21:09.402 --> 21:10.071
When did you start working here?

21:10.104 --> 21:11.572
Late last week.

21:11.606 --> 21:12.640
Is Danny comfortable

21:12.673 --> 21:14.307
having you around these drunks?

21:14.341 --> 21:16.010
Well, I kicked him out.

21:17.545 --> 21:20.848
Oh shit, I'm sorry, I didn't-

21:20.882 --> 21:22.315
- Oh it's all right... I think.

21:23.450 --> 21:27.021
Seeing as I ran out of his sock
drawer money, here I am.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.388
Shit.

21:30.691 --> 21:32.468
Friend of a friend said
they saw him in St. Louis.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.361
I hope he drowns
in the Mississippi.

21:35.129 --> 21:36.597
Let me get you beer.

21:37.999 --> 21:39.734
Hey, good to see
you here, Lacey.

21:40.768 --> 21:41.836
You improve the place.

21:46.707 --> 21:49.010
She was prettier in high school.

21:53.114 --> 21:56.349
Give me a dance and I'll
forgive you for making eyes.

21:56.383 --> 21:57.685
Hey, you know I don't dance.

21:57.718 --> 21:59.887
Come on baby,
it's Saturday night.

21:59.921 --> 22:01.421
You know I don't dance.

22:54.775 --> 22:55.810
Hey, buddy.

22:58.179 --> 23:00.514
Hey.

23:00.548 --> 23:01.592
It's great to
see nothing changes

23:01.616 --> 23:02.984
but the seasons around here.

23:05.553 --> 23:06.787
- Where's Kathy?
- Home.

23:09.156 --> 23:10.156
Smart woman.

23:13.160 --> 23:15.796
You go to Reese
Campbell's party the other night.

23:15.830 --> 23:17.164
Nah, I missed it.

23:17.198 --> 23:18.866
I heard it was a good time.

23:20.701 --> 23:21.903
He did some time, right?

23:24.071 --> 23:26.674
Yeah, he's clean now.

23:28.142 --> 23:29.744
That's not what I hear.

23:32.179 --> 23:34.048
You two working together.

23:36.050 --> 23:38.219
What?

23:38.252 --> 23:40.888
Whatever you're
into, I'm cool, man.

23:42.890 --> 23:46.493
I think you got some
wrong information.

23:46.527 --> 23:47.662
Maybe I did, maybe I did.

23:51.132 --> 23:54.201
Got some stuff flies faster
than skeeters around here.

24:05.947 --> 24:07.748
I got an early shift tomorrow.

24:07.782 --> 24:09.050
One drink?

24:09.083 --> 24:10.083
It's been a long time.

24:11.719 --> 24:12.719
Yeah, it has.

24:14.155 --> 24:15.155
I've missed you.

24:18.292 --> 24:20.460
Let's maybe tie one
on later this week.

24:23.864 --> 24:24.864
I'll try.

24:26.233 --> 24:28.703
Make it happen, Kemosabe.

24:55.730 --> 24:57.531
- Hey, Cole!
- Hey.

24:59.133 --> 25:03.070
Lord have mercy, what has
he brought us this time?

25:03.104 --> 25:05.106
I got you a crossword.

25:06.140 --> 25:08.642
Oh, thank you.

25:08.676 --> 25:09.853
All right,
I'll bring these inside.

25:09.877 --> 25:11.112
- Go on inside, son.
- Okay.

25:21.188 --> 25:23.057
Help yourself to coffee!

25:28.696 --> 25:30.297
You make this
with the tap water?

25:32.233 --> 25:35.102
You can't, you can't drink this.

25:35.136 --> 25:37.004
How many times do
I gotta tell y'all.

25:39.040 --> 25:42.076
Hey, why don't y'all
let me fix that floor?

25:42.109 --> 25:44.245
House won't be
standing much longer.

25:44.278 --> 25:46.013
Yeah, us neither.

25:47.848 --> 25:51.152
By the way, I got
something for ya.

25:51.185 --> 25:52.753
Yes, sir.

25:52.787 --> 25:54.331
I don't know why they
still prescribe them,

25:54.355 --> 25:56.323
back ain't bothered me for ages.

25:56.357 --> 25:57.357
Thank you.

25:59.160 --> 26:00.160
See y'all later.

26:07.134 --> 26:10.171
You have one unheard message.

26:11.839 --> 26:14.175
Cole, I need
you to call Rebecca's

26:14.208 --> 26:15.709
cellphone when you get this.

26:18.112 --> 26:20.281
End of message.

28:17.431 --> 28:18.431
Ruby.

28:29.043 --> 28:30.043
Ruby.

28:57.204 --> 28:58.506
He said this one a lot.

29:00.241 --> 29:03.043
Proverbs 23:13.

29:04.178 --> 29:07.214
Do not withhold
discipline from a child.

29:07.248 --> 29:09.250
If you punish them with a rod-

29:09.283 --> 29:10.217
- Or switch-

29:10.251 --> 29:11.251
- Or a hand.

29:13.420 --> 29:14.788
He was a good man.

29:14.822 --> 29:16.023
He was a good man.

29:16.056 --> 29:17.801
Take care of yourself, I'll
come back and check on you.

29:17.825 --> 29:19.793
- All right, thank you.
- Hey.

29:25.933 --> 29:27.401
You all right?

29:27.434 --> 29:31.238
I just needed a
little moment of quiet.

29:49.591 --> 29:50.591
Oh my God.

29:57.931 --> 29:58.931
Hey.

30:00.134 --> 30:02.970
I thought I would
make it in time.

30:04.271 --> 30:06.140
- Hey there.
- Oh, Rebecca.

30:14.214 --> 30:15.916
Come here, mama.

30:15.949 --> 30:19.153
Oh Ruby, I can't
believe you're here.

30:40.608 --> 30:41.609
Hey you.

31:14.441 --> 31:15.976
Hey.

31:16.009 --> 31:16.578
Hey.

31:16.611 --> 31:18.078
Hi.

31:18.112 --> 31:19.557
I'm so sorry. I couldn't
make the service.

31:19.581 --> 31:21.148
Randy and I had-

31:21.181 --> 31:22.983
- Oh no, hey, that's okay.

31:23.951 --> 31:24.951
Okay.

31:26.987 --> 31:29.657
Let me know if you need
anything, all right?

31:29.691 --> 31:31.325
All right, yeah, thanks.

31:32.259 --> 31:33.293
Okay.

31:33.327 --> 31:34.662
Ellen, I appreciate that.

31:34.696 --> 31:35.696
Okay.

31:46.373 --> 31:47.941
I'm real sorry.

32:00.220 --> 32:01.221
There it is.

32:09.597 --> 32:12.032
Let me love on you a little.

32:17.104 --> 32:19.574
Everything's gonna be all right.

32:31.619 --> 32:34.054
You got a lot on
your mind, I know.

32:39.026 --> 32:40.194
It true your mamas back?

32:47.267 --> 32:49.704
Where's she been, what she want?

32:49.737 --> 32:50.737
I don't know.

32:55.409 --> 32:59.379
That's all you got to
say after all this time?

33:01.215 --> 33:02.483
You ain't even the least bit-

33:02.517 --> 33:04.351
- What's this got
to do with you?

33:08.288 --> 33:13.293
Wow.

33:17.397 --> 33:18.397
Well, fuck it.

33:44.592 --> 33:47.629
- Jodie.
- Trying to get high.

33:47.662 --> 33:49.129
Just something.

34:02.109 --> 34:03.611
How you holding up?

34:03.645 --> 34:04.812
I'm all right.

34:07.815 --> 34:10.317
You don't look it,
don't mind me saying.

34:10.350 --> 34:11.350
I'm fine.

34:13.721 --> 34:15.455
Y'all gonna settle
now he's gone?

34:16.791 --> 34:18.292
No, we're not going anywhere.

34:18.325 --> 34:21.696
Oh, I'm happy to hear that.

34:21.729 --> 34:24.398
I mean, it's nice to see
somebody's not giving in.

34:26.366 --> 34:28.135
Hey, buddy.

34:28.168 --> 34:31.739
Oh, look who it is, our
most devoted new customer.

34:31.773 --> 34:33.273
Returning customer, darling.

34:34.742 --> 34:37.110
Three shots of the wildest
turkey you got back there,

34:37.144 --> 34:38.145
third one's for you.

34:44.519 --> 34:46.320
Real sorry to hear
about Clyde, man.

34:51.659 --> 34:52.659
Thanks.

34:56.531 --> 34:58.533
At least you know
what's happening,

34:58.566 --> 35:00.233
finally up close
with the big guy.

35:03.403 --> 35:04.403
You got a point.

35:07.307 --> 35:08.610
Well, I can't do too much,

35:08.643 --> 35:10.043
but I can get you
drunker than hell.

35:11.478 --> 35:12.478
Here you go.

35:21.589 --> 35:24.759
I might as well
drink the third one.

35:26.861 --> 35:28.395
How was I supposed to know

35:28.428 --> 35:29.948
you couldn't piss by
a playground, man?

35:31.866 --> 35:35.235
- You haven't changed at all.
- Everybody doing all right?

35:35.268 --> 35:36.388
Yeah, we're doing all right.

35:44.612 --> 35:45.612
Oh, man.

35:47.515 --> 35:51.218
Crazy, crazy is those fuckers
over there in Campbell, man.

35:53.253 --> 35:54.622
They're fucking crazy,

35:54.656 --> 35:56.265
I knew a guy who cooked
meth in his trailer,

35:56.289 --> 35:58.158
damn near blew the
roof right off, man.

35:59.426 --> 36:00.426
You ever try it?

36:02.396 --> 36:03.396
No.

36:04.899 --> 36:06.233
It's pretty wild, man.

36:07.101 --> 36:09.236
Wouldn't be your
kind of buzz though.

36:09.269 --> 36:10.303
Really?

36:10.337 --> 36:13.373
Really, I'm pretty sure.

36:13.407 --> 36:15.409
Your friend, your friend Reese,

36:16.577 --> 36:18.311
I mean I hear that fairy

36:18.345 --> 36:20.748
can't put it up his nose
fast enough, crystal, ox.

36:24.284 --> 36:26.319
I guess some guys just
like to swing both ways.

36:26.353 --> 36:28.388
Why you keep asking around then?

36:29.590 --> 36:32.660
Well, I'm working with some
boys up the way, you know.

36:34.996 --> 36:36.496
Gonna start our own operation.

36:38.298 --> 36:40.276
And the way I see it a lot
of folks around are going

36:40.300 --> 36:45.305
to be graduating from
the service you provide.

36:48.576 --> 36:51.211
Well, my what?

36:52.446 --> 36:53.614
You wanna go in with me?

36:58.586 --> 37:00.621
You already know all
the best customers.

37:00.655 --> 37:03.323
You don't wanna
mess with junk, man.

37:03.356 --> 37:05.392
There's a fella in town.

37:05.425 --> 37:07.562
Everett, Everett
won't know about it.

37:08.596 --> 37:10.397
Oh yeah?

37:10.430 --> 37:12.442
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, no, no, no, no, no.

37:12.466 --> 37:13.601
I'm gonna diversify.

37:15.335 --> 37:18.472
Chrissy hasn't gone
anywhere, it's just on cops,

37:18.506 --> 37:19.874
the back burner so to speak.

37:21.408 --> 37:22.409
That's funny.

37:22.442 --> 37:23.745
Stupid.

37:23.778 --> 37:25.445
Yeah, I need a place to cook,

37:25.479 --> 37:27.279
I was thinking about
that old church of yours.

37:29.884 --> 37:31.853
It's nothing but
crumbling walls now.

37:31.886 --> 37:33.821
I could park something there.

37:35.656 --> 37:38.258
Not on our land, Terry,
that's not gonna happen.

37:47.568 --> 37:48.568
All right.

37:50.705 --> 37:53.273
Sole proprietor on
this one, I got it.

37:55.342 --> 37:59.312
I'd be careful about who
you're telling your ideas to.

38:02.717 --> 38:04.919
This town is small, it
already has its ways.

38:10.892 --> 38:15.062
Just in a pretty
deep hole is all.

38:19.100 --> 38:23.805
It's time to start
digging out, you know?

38:25.907 --> 38:26.907
Yeah.

38:31.913 --> 38:33.748
You remember when
we cut our hands?

38:35.116 --> 38:37.484
Like a couple buffalo
jockies, you remember that?

38:37.518 --> 38:39.086
Yes, stupid kids.

38:43.124 --> 38:45.026
The blood runs thick, don't it?

38:50.064 --> 38:51.498
That it does.

38:59.807 --> 39:03.343
How dear to my heart are
the scenes of my childhood,

39:04.745 --> 39:08.082
when fond recollections
presents them to view.

39:09.884 --> 39:14.889
The orchard, the meadow,
the deep tangled wildwood,

39:16.691 --> 39:19.426
and ev'ry loved spot
which my infancy knew.

39:21.162 --> 39:25.733
The wide spreading pond, and
the mill that stood by it.

39:25.766 --> 39:28.836
The bridge and the rock
where the cataract fell.

39:31.839 --> 39:33.473
It's real nice you read to her.

39:36.443 --> 39:38.579
I am real nice.

39:39.714 --> 39:41.481
Contrary to what
you may have heard.

39:52.560 --> 39:56.530
Look, buddy, I got
nothing for you.

40:03.537 --> 40:05.072
You selling elsewhere?

40:06.641 --> 40:07.641
Fuck you.

40:09.911 --> 40:12.146
Who's been advising
you since day one

40:12.179 --> 40:14.882
of this little venture yours?

40:14.916 --> 40:15.916
Huh?

40:16.684 --> 40:17.684
What do I get?

40:18.451 --> 40:21.454
Terry fucking Rose up
my ass day and night

40:21.488 --> 40:24.158
saying you told him I can
help him cook up some crack.

40:24.191 --> 40:25.192
I didn't.

40:25.226 --> 40:26.861
No, fuck you

40:26.894 --> 40:28.614
for bringing that kind
shit back in my life.

40:29.830 --> 40:31.232
I never said that, Reese.

40:31.265 --> 40:33.134
This here's Ruthie's home.

40:34.936 --> 40:37.138
I ain't gonna mess
with her estate.

40:37.171 --> 40:38.773
That little prick's so hard up,

40:38.806 --> 40:40.150
he can shake and bake
like everybody else,

40:40.174 --> 40:41.842
don't need to fucking trailer.

40:42.810 --> 40:45.079
I'm sorry he's hassling you.

40:45.112 --> 40:46.112
Yeah, me too.

40:51.152 --> 40:56.123
All this H talk, Cole, that
boy better shut his mouth.

41:09.737 --> 41:12.073
Can you front me some pills?

41:13.641 --> 41:17.044
Ruthie's Medicaid's all
fucked up right now.

41:17.078 --> 41:18.079
Yeah, yeah.

41:19.180 --> 41:20.180
All right.

41:31.225 --> 41:32.693
You know I'm good for it.

41:34.895 --> 41:35.896
Yeah, I do.

41:40.167 --> 41:41.167
I'll see you.

42:03.657 --> 42:07.094
My timing's always been perfect.

42:07.128 --> 42:08.162
Been happening all day.

42:10.131 --> 42:11.966
No wonder daddy
thought the end was nigh.

42:13.034 --> 42:13.934
Who can live like this?

42:13.968 --> 42:14.968
You one to judge?

42:15.936 --> 42:17.671
Is it so bad that
I'm still here?

42:20.641 --> 42:21.641
Can I come in?

42:23.944 --> 42:25.112
I'm not stopping you.

42:31.685 --> 42:32.887
What you reading?

42:51.338 --> 42:52.338
You're just like him.

42:53.674 --> 42:55.142
Clean and sparse, holy.

42:57.678 --> 42:59.213
I'll return to the house I left,

43:00.214 --> 43:02.716
swept clean, and in right order.

43:04.118 --> 43:05.252
Matthew 12:44.

43:06.987 --> 43:09.023
Keeps coming back, like a rash.

43:10.291 --> 43:11.291
Yeah.

43:24.972 --> 43:26.607
You're wearing my shirt.

43:35.416 --> 43:36.984
You all done much traveling?

43:44.458 --> 43:45.726
I've been all over.

43:46.694 --> 43:48.896
I haven't been west of
the Mississippi though.

43:48.929 --> 43:50.064
It's too far from home.

43:52.700 --> 43:53.700
Yeah.

43:57.738 --> 43:59.173
You wouldn't understand, baby.

44:30.070 --> 44:31.070
No, I wouldn't.

44:38.145 --> 44:40.080
You kept them.

44:41.248 --> 44:43.083
That's real nice.

45:21.055 --> 45:23.090
Got a friend right
over there in Beverly

45:23.123 --> 45:25.926
who can hook us up with cold
meds, and a place to cook.

45:27.394 --> 45:29.930
This just to get some
cash flow coming in.

45:30.798 --> 45:32.299
I got bigger buys on route.

45:33.535 --> 45:36.303
This town ain't gonna be no
one horse operation for long.

45:49.350 --> 45:51.919
Hey, hey, all right
Davis, hey, Davis, Davis,

45:51.952 --> 45:53.320
hey, hey, Davis, Davis.

45:53.354 --> 45:55.889
Look at me, Ellen is
on your side, okay?

45:55.923 --> 45:58.560
Like me, I'm on your
side okay, you trust me.

45:58.593 --> 45:59.493
Calm down, calm down.

45:59.527 --> 46:01.137
All right, let her
go, she's on your side,

46:01.161 --> 46:02.062
you're fine, you're okay.

46:02.096 --> 46:03.097
Okay.

46:03.130 --> 46:03.931
You're okay, all right?

46:03.964 --> 46:04.566
Okay.

46:04.599 --> 46:05.399
You're okay.

46:05.432 --> 46:06.467
Okay.

46:06.500 --> 46:07.301
You're okay, you're okay.

46:07.334 --> 46:08.369
You're okay.

46:09.236 --> 46:10.236
Cole!

46:12.439 --> 46:14.308
Are y'all okay?

46:14.341 --> 46:15.476
Let me see it.

46:15.510 --> 46:16.343
You all right?

46:16.377 --> 46:17.878
Yeah.

46:17.911 --> 46:19.256
I gotta get me some
younger friends.

46:19.280 --> 46:20.481
Yeah, ya do.

46:20.515 --> 46:23.017
- Yeah, you all right?
- Yeah.

46:25.085 --> 46:26.186
Well that was a day.

46:26.220 --> 46:27.220
Yeah.

46:28.022 --> 46:30.357
Hey, you want to
go grab a cold one?

46:30.391 --> 46:31.391
I can't.

46:32.393 --> 46:36.196
Randy, he, he's finally
got a night off.

46:36.230 --> 46:38.932
You know, so much
over time these days.

46:38.966 --> 46:40.568
Hey, Randy.

46:40.602 --> 46:42.322
Trying to crack
down on all this drug stuff.

46:43.337 --> 46:45.005
You should keep ice on your eye.

46:45.039 --> 46:46.307
Yeah.

46:46.340 --> 46:47.374
Thank you, for earlier.

46:47.408 --> 46:50.878
Yeah, don't, don't mention it.

46:56.083 --> 46:57.083
Hey.

46:58.052 --> 46:59.052
Bye.

47:07.261 --> 47:08.829
What happened to you?

47:10.898 --> 47:12.199
Work.

47:12.232 --> 47:14.001
What'd you do
change professions?

47:14.034 --> 47:16.103
You go work in the mines?

47:16.136 --> 47:18.906
- Over my dead body.
- Atta boy.

47:18.939 --> 47:21.208
Hey Lacey, get me another beer?

47:33.655 --> 47:35.923
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

47:37.024 --> 47:38.325
Night shift?

47:38.359 --> 47:40.060
I'm just taking
the day off, man.

47:40.662 --> 47:42.630
Fixing to get fired
is what he's doing.

47:49.203 --> 47:51.071
Y'all come here together?

47:51.105 --> 47:54.007
Where else you go in this
town with time on your hands?

47:57.177 --> 47:59.313
What happened to your eye?

48:03.384 --> 48:06.086
Those two have
been back there all day.

48:06.120 --> 48:07.121
You're up.

48:08.255 --> 48:09.255
Okay.

48:10.725 --> 48:12.594
Get that red one.

48:26.708 --> 48:29.209
Thank you, son.

48:29.243 --> 48:30.244
Don't run off.

48:42.189 --> 48:44.559
- Hey, you hungry?
- Hey, Cole.

49:03.310 --> 49:05.012
Hey there, Cole.

49:07.214 --> 49:08.224
I'm all right, you all right?

49:08.248 --> 49:09.283
Yeah I'm all right.

49:09.316 --> 49:10.316
Okay.

49:13.353 --> 49:14.354
How are you doing?

49:14.388 --> 49:15.388
I'm all right now.

49:45.687 --> 49:47.488
Get up.

49:47.522 --> 49:49.223
I said get up.

49:49.256 --> 49:51.056
You'll be all right,
I'll get ya out tomorrow.

49:59.834 --> 50:02.035
No, no, I wouldn't
do that to you, man.

50:04.539 --> 50:06.240
Rumors Everett, rumors.

50:09.142 --> 50:10.645
Small town lies
to pass the time.

50:17.819 --> 50:19.821
I wouldn't do that to you, man.

50:19.854 --> 50:23.156
I wouldn't do that to you, man.

50:23.190 --> 50:24.190
Okay.

50:26.728 --> 50:28.295
There's no way I'd
step on your toes.

50:30.565 --> 50:31.565
No way.

50:38.405 --> 50:39.439
Bye, Everett.

50:44.211 --> 50:47.047
You do know Christmas
ain't for a long time?

50:48.850 --> 50:50.083
Cheers Ruthie up.

50:51.753 --> 50:56.658
No harm in a little twinkle
twinkle every now and then.

51:04.398 --> 51:07.569
Your friend Terry Rose is
going to be the end of me.

51:07.602 --> 51:09.102
Old friend.

51:09.136 --> 51:11.271
Yeah, well, wish
I had known that.

51:13.440 --> 51:14.440
What?

51:19.279 --> 51:23.383
I gave him some of these
allergy scripts to cook up.

51:27.789 --> 51:29.456
Why'd you do that, Reese?

51:32.259 --> 51:33.728
Charlotte said it was cool.

51:37.397 --> 51:39.266
Whatever, man, I
don't fucking know.

51:45.740 --> 51:46.641
Are they cooking in here?

51:46.674 --> 51:47.674
Fuck no.

51:49.644 --> 51:53.146
Anyway, I'm done with that boy.

51:54.314 --> 51:55.314
Fini, caput.

52:00.622 --> 52:02.289
You better be careful.

52:03.858 --> 52:07.895
Everett finds out that you're
involved even a little bit.

52:07.929 --> 52:08.929
Oh please.

52:37.324 --> 52:39.292
Fuck, man.

52:42.396 --> 52:44.599
How much longer you
think we got this in us?

52:47.769 --> 52:49.336
I don't know.

52:49.369 --> 52:51.171
Ruthie be gone by Christmas?

52:54.441 --> 52:56.309
I gotta get the fuck outta here.

52:59.413 --> 53:03.283
I get caught with
anything, and I'm done.

53:03.316 --> 53:07.287
Brother, they're going to
send my ass right on back.

53:13.961 --> 53:16.764
I'm talking some place warm.

53:18.766 --> 53:19.766
Far away.

53:21.536 --> 53:23.905
Water you can swim
outside in warm.

53:23.938 --> 53:26.808
Swim in January
warm, you feel me?

53:26.841 --> 53:28.208
Yeah.

53:32.747 --> 53:34.949
I'll see old Ruthie
through the gates of heaven,

53:34.982 --> 53:37.652
pay off a little bit
of debt, and then warm.

53:38.619 --> 53:43.658
Warm, warm, warm, SPF
warm, Florida style.

53:49.630 --> 53:50.630
You watch me.

53:59.674 --> 54:02.543
You can't come in
quite yet, but I'm almost done.

54:03.978 --> 54:05.880
I don't want you to
see this till tonight.

54:05.913 --> 54:07.515
All right.

54:12.854 --> 54:14.421
Okay, come on.

54:14.454 --> 54:16.023
- You ready?
- Yeah.

54:18.358 --> 54:20.561
I don't know why your
granddaddy made such fuss

54:20.595 --> 54:23.296
about salad breaking
someones birthday.

54:23.330 --> 54:24.331
Maybe he had his reasons.

54:24.364 --> 54:25.700
Mm-hmm.

54:25.733 --> 54:28.002
He also didn't think I
should get my hair cut.

54:28.035 --> 54:30.972
Hey, you gotta make Ruby
clean up after herself.

54:31.005 --> 54:33.908
Well I get onto her about
it, but I really don't mind.

54:35.475 --> 54:36.475
I'm glad she's here.

54:37.879 --> 54:39.046
This is my son.

54:43.383 --> 54:45.418
You rehearsed his
sermons in here, Grandma.

54:47.088 --> 54:49.322
Ruby thinks I should travel.

54:49.356 --> 54:51.391
She says there's a
whole lot more to see

54:51.424 --> 54:52.760
in this world than Dove Creek.

54:52.794 --> 54:53.694
Oh yeah?

54:53.728 --> 54:54.728
She'd know.

54:57.131 --> 54:59.432
You know sometimes
you just have to make

54:59.466 --> 55:01.636
the best out of a bad situation.

55:05.706 --> 55:06.941
Go see her at work.

55:08.743 --> 55:10.745
What, she got a job?

55:10.778 --> 55:12.445
Well if you came
around here more often,

55:12.479 --> 55:13.748
you'd know that, wouldn't you?

55:15.049 --> 55:16.049
Go see her.

55:27.995 --> 55:29.329
Thanks.

55:31.098 --> 55:32.567
What do you think of this getup?

55:35.102 --> 55:36.102
Mine any better?

55:37.171 --> 55:39.807
Yes, yes it is.

55:44.512 --> 55:45.680
Mom ask you to come by?

55:48.783 --> 55:49.783
Yeah.

55:52.019 --> 55:53.621
Well, you came anyway.

55:59.627 --> 56:03.496
You got plans for tonight,
big birthday bash at the bar?

56:03.531 --> 56:04.531
No, not really.

56:06.634 --> 56:08.435
I'm-I'm trying to
stay out of trouble.

56:10.137 --> 56:11.137
Yeah, okay.

56:18.813 --> 56:20.514
You busy tomorrow morning?

56:20.548 --> 56:23.517
I need to pick up a
few things at the BNP

56:23.551 --> 56:25.052
and it'd be nice to
have a companion.

56:28.756 --> 56:30.524
I'll take you.

56:30.558 --> 56:31.558
Thank you.

56:36.864 --> 56:40.433
Found you some
more nursing books.

56:40.467 --> 56:42.169
Got them at a store
in Charleston.

56:44.772 --> 56:46.140
Ruby, breaks over.

56:47.108 --> 56:48.109
That's me.

56:48.943 --> 56:50.144
Happy birthday.

56:51.478 --> 56:52.478
Thanks.

57:45.599 --> 57:48.169
Never thought I'd come up
here again without Danny.

58:17.264 --> 58:18.599
It's been destroyed.

58:26.574 --> 58:29.176
They're supposed to clean up
after their mess, rebuild.

58:33.214 --> 58:35.716
That's the least of
their concerns right now.

58:50.331 --> 58:54.135
Did you hear Caldwell
went under last week.

58:57.605 --> 59:02.076
Well, can only chip away
at something for so long.

59:08.249 --> 59:11.318
Going to be nothing
left for my girl.

59:18.025 --> 59:19.160
I'm sorry.

59:19.193 --> 59:20.327
No, that's all right.

59:22.997 --> 59:25.900
Hey, here.

59:27.334 --> 59:28.335
What?

59:28.369 --> 59:29.170
Take this.

59:29.203 --> 59:30.271
What's that?

59:30.304 --> 59:31.384
It'll make you feel better.

59:38.045 --> 59:39.045
You just do that.

59:48.222 --> 59:49.223
That was okay.

59:51.325 --> 59:52.193
Give me another one.

59:52.226 --> 59:53.226
Okay.

59:55.663 --> 59:57.264
This is a good
one, I can feel it.

59:57.298 --> 59:58.933
You ready?

1:00:00.434 --> 1:00:02.236
That's pretty good,
wanna see what I got?

1:00:02.269 --> 1:00:03.269
Yeah.

1:00:05.673 --> 1:00:06.974
That was good.

1:00:13.380 --> 1:00:14.381
Fuck!

1:00:17.918 --> 1:00:20.221
That was all right.

1:00:26.427 --> 1:00:28.696
I'm keeping this one.

1:00:28.729 --> 1:00:30.030
That's a nice one.

1:01:15.342 --> 1:01:16.342
Hey.

1:01:18.846 --> 1:01:19.846
Smoke break?

1:01:21.248 --> 1:01:22.249
I can't just now.

1:01:23.884 --> 1:01:24.884
I'm not asking.

1:01:34.461 --> 1:01:35.461
This is hard.

1:01:36.430 --> 1:01:37.430
What?

1:01:41.035 --> 1:01:42.236
I know what you do, Cole.

1:01:44.171 --> 1:01:45.171
What I do?

1:01:46.340 --> 1:01:47.340
Don't lie to me.

1:02:03.257 --> 1:02:04.458
How?

1:02:04.491 --> 1:02:06.227
How do you think?

1:02:14.335 --> 1:02:16.103
You got a good man.

1:02:17.505 --> 1:02:18.505
Yeah.

1:02:28.182 --> 1:02:29.149
You steal from here?

1:02:29.183 --> 1:02:30.183
No, no, no.

1:02:33.187 --> 1:02:34.187
I'm careful.

1:02:35.456 --> 1:02:38.092
You know an investigation
here would be a disaster.

1:02:39.260 --> 1:02:41.362
Prescriptions held
up, insurance holds.

1:02:42.997 --> 1:02:44.941
I mean, you got to think
about these folks in here.

1:02:44.965 --> 1:02:46.333
Yeah, I do think about them.

1:02:46.367 --> 1:02:48.235
Yeah, but you can't
keep working here.

1:02:48.269 --> 1:02:50.404
You can't keep putting
these people at risk.

1:02:50.437 --> 1:02:52.306
Is that so?

1:02:52.339 --> 1:02:54.579
I'm trying to be your friend
here and I don't have to be.

1:02:58.946 --> 1:02:59.980
Fuck this.

1:03:00.014 --> 1:03:01.081
Who do you think you are?

1:03:02.916 --> 1:03:04.251
We care for these people,

1:03:05.486 --> 1:03:07.254
and then you go out

1:03:07.288 --> 1:03:09.165
and you make folks more
sick than they already are?

1:03:09.189 --> 1:03:10.824
Like, fuck this, fuck you.

1:03:11.492 --> 1:03:12.860
Fuck you, Cole.

1:03:35.550 --> 1:03:38.252
Cole, it's
Charlotte, I have some bad news.

1:03:38.285 --> 1:03:39.853
Call me.

1:03:40.954 --> 1:03:42.590
Oh hey, this is Lacey.

1:03:42.624 --> 1:03:44.491
Looking forward to
seeing ya tonight.

1:03:44.526 --> 1:03:46.393
Sitter'll be here by eight.

1:03:49.531 --> 1:03:52.833
Hey man, I got a
little situation over here.

1:03:53.535 --> 1:03:55.069
Can you drop by?

1:03:57.639 --> 1:03:59.440
Cole I know
you're angry, you gotta call me.

1:04:33.708 --> 1:04:36.076
Oh he's cool, it's cool.

1:04:41.315 --> 1:04:42.315
Doc.

1:04:43.685 --> 1:04:45.986
Good seeing you, buddy.

1:04:51.258 --> 1:04:52.226
Hey.

1:04:52.259 --> 1:04:53.293
Hey, you all right?

1:04:55.062 --> 1:04:56.062
Yeah.

1:04:57.331 --> 1:04:58.633
Ruthie done passed on.

1:04:58.666 --> 1:04:59.666
Oh yeah.

1:05:00.535 --> 1:05:03.003
That old lady's gone, ain't she?

1:05:03.036 --> 1:05:04.572
Should've known by the smell.

1:05:06.073 --> 1:05:07.274
Mouth on you.

1:05:11.679 --> 1:05:14.582
No sugar, no, no, no.

1:05:15.983 --> 1:05:17.685
That's just your stank pussy.

1:05:35.135 --> 1:05:38.038
How many times you
need to hear it, man?

1:05:39.440 --> 1:05:41.942
I ain't seen Terry in weeks.

1:05:45.012 --> 1:05:47.414
Back in Campbell far as I know.

1:05:54.354 --> 1:05:55.222
Hey, Reese.

1:05:55.255 --> 1:05:56.290
Nah, I got this.

1:05:57.324 --> 1:05:59.661
This between me and him.

1:05:59.694 --> 1:06:04.364
Now, might there be something
else you're interested in?

1:06:06.099 --> 1:06:07.301
Right about here?

1:06:16.109 --> 1:06:19.581
Come on, cowboy.

1:06:19.614 --> 1:06:20.614
Yeah.

1:06:44.839 --> 1:06:47.040
Oh, my, my.

1:06:47.074 --> 1:06:50.244
How quickly this is turning
into my kind of party.

1:06:52.145 --> 1:06:53.145
Get him up.

1:06:54.481 --> 1:06:56.149
So you want it on this, doc?

1:06:57.619 --> 1:06:59.554
I'm just trying to
help out a friend.

1:07:00.487 --> 1:07:04.526
Your friends, quite
the entrepreneurs.

1:07:04.559 --> 1:07:07.160
How much is it gonna
take to fix this?

1:07:07.194 --> 1:07:08.563
I like that.

1:07:09.764 --> 1:07:11.365
How much you offering?

1:07:11.398 --> 1:07:13.635
I got close to
1200 on me right now.

1:07:20.875 --> 1:07:22.276
Count it.

1:07:33.220 --> 1:07:34.856
Is this what you
want, you sexy beast?

1:07:34.889 --> 1:07:35.889
Fuck you.

1:07:38.358 --> 1:07:40.327
Is this what you want?

1:07:42.396 --> 1:07:43.396
Do it.

1:07:55.442 --> 1:07:56.544
Take it.

1:07:56.578 --> 1:07:58.111
Yeah, yeah.

1:07:58.145 --> 1:08:00.314
It's only about 1100 boss.

1:08:03.585 --> 1:08:05.218
It'll do.

1:08:10.558 --> 1:08:11.793
Well, this has been

1:08:11.826 --> 1:08:14.328
an absolutely delightful
evening, ladies.

1:08:14.361 --> 1:08:16.330
Oh yeah, go on and get.

1:08:17.565 --> 1:08:18.866
Unless of course you want

1:08:18.900 --> 1:08:21.669
to stick something
else in my mouth.

1:08:26.841 --> 1:08:28.876
I hear Terry Rose has been

1:08:28.910 --> 1:08:31.546
visiting a few of your patients.

1:08:31.579 --> 1:08:33.146
Such decent folks.

1:08:33.180 --> 1:08:34.147
Leave them out of it.

1:08:34.181 --> 1:08:35.282
I'd like to, doc.

1:08:36.283 --> 1:08:38.620
I've always appreciated
our little arrangement,

1:08:38.653 --> 1:08:40.320
you teeing folks up and all.

1:08:41.355 --> 1:08:42.523
We aren't the same.

1:08:42.557 --> 1:08:43.825
Go find your pal.

1:08:46.259 --> 1:08:49.429
Go find Terry Rose and
that little whore of his,

1:08:49.463 --> 1:08:52.332
we need to have a little
conversation about geography.

1:08:53.534 --> 1:08:55.335
They're in some
dangerous territory.

1:08:56.403 --> 1:08:57.403
Mine!

1:09:00.474 --> 1:09:01.474
In the meantime,

1:09:06.581 --> 1:09:11.284
we're gonna have ourselves
a little lesson in manners.

1:09:13.988 --> 1:09:15.422
Go!

1:10:40.007 --> 1:10:41.676
Courtney, would you
get in the car please?

1:10:41.709 --> 1:10:42.753
Can I just talk to you for-

1:10:42.777 --> 1:10:43.978
- No, wait just a minute.

1:10:49.584 --> 1:10:51.819
What do you think you're doing?

1:10:51.853 --> 1:10:53.554
I just need to talk
to you for a minute.

1:10:53.588 --> 1:10:55.388
No, I can't.

1:10:55.422 --> 1:10:56.991
Look, I got no room for this.

1:12:53.007 --> 1:12:54.441
Don't be afraid.

1:12:57.211 --> 1:12:58.646
Praise the Lord.

1:13:11.692 --> 1:13:14.461
Everybody has the time
here to die at home!

1:13:18.165 --> 1:13:21.736
But we know when the
devil is among us,

1:13:21.769 --> 1:13:24.138
we know when the
devil is at hand.

1:13:24.171 --> 1:13:26.040
But are we ready?

1:13:26.073 --> 1:13:27.008
Tell him we're ready!

1:13:27.041 --> 1:13:27.942
We're ready!

1:13:27.975 --> 1:13:29.644
Tell him we're ready.

1:13:38.619 --> 1:13:42.123
Nothing to be afraid
of, not today, no.

1:13:42.156 --> 1:13:44.592
All gonna be saved by me.

1:13:47.194 --> 1:13:49.664
Cast out, the devil
found him, cast out,

1:13:49.697 --> 1:13:52.465
the devil found him,
cast out, the devil,

1:13:52.499 --> 1:13:54.101
we won't let you make.

1:13:56.037 --> 1:13:58.172
Name of the Lord, yes Lord.

1:13:59.573 --> 1:14:02.209
Cast out whatever
devils is in him.

1:14:04.211 --> 1:14:05.546
Don't be afraid.

1:14:06.847 --> 1:14:09.517
Show him no mercy,
don't be afraid.

1:14:09.550 --> 1:14:11.118
Praise be to Jesus.

1:14:12.119 --> 1:14:16.223
We know him, we know when
the devil is at hand.

1:14:17.625 --> 1:14:18.960
And when we do.

1:14:18.993 --> 1:14:22.797
We feel the holy
spirit even stronger.

1:14:22.830 --> 1:14:25.266
We know it's coming for you,

1:14:25.299 --> 1:14:27.768
we know that he's
a coming for us.

1:14:27.802 --> 1:14:30.237
Give him a voice dear lord.

1:14:31.138 --> 1:14:32.974
Lord give him a voice.

1:15:20.287 --> 1:15:21.589
You trying to get saved?

1:15:35.936 --> 1:15:37.605
Come on, backslider.

1:15:50.317 --> 1:15:53.354
- What ya got?
- Possible overdose.

1:15:53.387 --> 1:15:55.589
Ma'am, ma'am?

1:15:55.623 --> 1:15:56.891
Is she breathing?

1:15:56.924 --> 1:15:58.893
Well, she's breathing
but not real good.

1:15:59.693 --> 1:16:01.028
You get a name?

1:16:01.062 --> 1:16:02.963
ID says Jodie Hampton.

1:16:02.997 --> 1:16:04.832
Think we're
going to get her over to-

1:17:25.479 --> 1:17:26.780
Mr. Campbell.

1:17:30.718 --> 1:17:31.986
Reese Campbell.

1:17:42.096 --> 1:17:44.365
This is police, open the door.

1:17:49.270 --> 1:17:50.404
Come on, Cole.

1:17:57.244 --> 1:17:58.979
Pick it up, pick it up buddy.

1:18:49.930 --> 1:18:52.399
- Hey baby.
- Hey Lottie.

1:18:52.433 --> 1:18:55.269
Don't get up mamaw, I'll
grab those for you.

1:18:58.372 --> 1:19:00.107
We keep missing
each other, friend.

1:19:02.943 --> 1:19:05.446
How did we get
so luck to have two

1:19:05.479 --> 1:19:08.282
fine young boys
taking care of us?

1:19:09.817 --> 1:19:12.286
Your friend
wants to rent our old barn

1:19:12.319 --> 1:19:15.222
and make a wood-working
project out of it.

1:19:16.090 --> 1:19:17.090
Oh yeah?

1:19:29.169 --> 1:19:30.304
Whoa.

1:19:30.337 --> 1:19:33.274
Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

1:19:36.143 --> 1:19:37.311
Get the fuck out of here.

1:19:40.447 --> 1:19:43.183
I just want you to hear me out.

1:19:43.217 --> 1:19:44.217
Just hear me out.

1:19:45.286 --> 1:19:46.320
I'll go to the cops.

1:19:50.357 --> 1:19:51.357
I doubt that.

1:19:52.326 --> 1:19:53.394
I'll go to Everett.

1:19:57.865 --> 1:19:59.433
You stay away from my people.

1:20:00.901 --> 1:20:04.371
It's a little late
for that now, ain't it?

1:20:05.272 --> 1:20:07.975
Meet me at the quarry
tomorrow night.

1:20:08.008 --> 1:20:09.843
We'll sort this out
once and for all.

1:20:12.112 --> 1:20:13.581
I mean I'd hate
to have to go see

1:20:13.615 --> 1:20:15.449
your grandma and Ruby too.

1:20:19.053 --> 1:20:20.555
I hope you're thirsty out there.

1:20:34.636 --> 1:20:35.869
Is Ruby here?

1:20:35.903 --> 1:20:37.539
I need you to talk to y'all.

1:20:37.572 --> 1:20:40.941
Oh, son, you've got someone
waiting for you out back.

1:20:45.479 --> 1:20:47.147
She's been out there for hours.

1:20:54.988 --> 1:20:57.891
Don't you ever come by my
grandmother's house again.

1:20:57.925 --> 1:20:58.925
You hear me?

1:21:00.662 --> 1:21:02.363
You high right now?

1:21:02.396 --> 1:21:03.396
Sit down.

1:21:15.309 --> 1:21:16.343
What are you doing here?

1:21:20.615 --> 1:21:25.587
He's gonna kill me, kill
you if he knows I'm here.

1:21:25.620 --> 1:21:27.454
I'm taking care of Terry.

1:21:31.191 --> 1:21:32.192
Everett.

1:21:35.530 --> 1:21:37.097
What'd you do?

1:21:45.673 --> 1:21:47.341
I've been working with Terry.

1:21:49.476 --> 1:21:50.978
He used my trailer to cook.

1:21:53.380 --> 1:21:54.380
Fuck.

1:21:56.751 --> 1:21:58.285
Charlotte.

1:22:06.160 --> 1:22:08.195
It was supposed to
be a one time thing.

1:22:09.531 --> 1:22:11.633
Then we'd be out of here.

1:22:35.657 --> 1:22:37.357
You're all I got, Cole.

1:22:48.803 --> 1:22:49.803
God.

1:22:51.371 --> 1:22:52.371
Man, fuck me.

1:22:53.407 --> 1:22:54.408
You serious?

1:22:54.441 --> 1:22:55.441
Yeah.

1:22:58.680 --> 1:23:00.481
You all right?

1:23:00.515 --> 1:23:01.515
I think so.

1:23:04.451 --> 1:23:05.451
You?

1:23:09.122 --> 1:23:10.122
Yeah.

1:23:11.526 --> 1:23:13.060
Home sweet home.

1:23:17.431 --> 1:23:19.333
Hey, I'm sorry about Florida.

1:23:20.300 --> 1:23:21.636
Oh, I'm gonna get there.

1:23:21.669 --> 1:23:23.270
God willing.

1:23:24.371 --> 1:23:25.451
What are you snickering at?

1:23:25.773 --> 1:23:27.374
You don't believe me?

1:23:27.407 --> 1:23:30.043
I never heard you
reference him before.

1:23:30.077 --> 1:23:31.077
Who?

1:23:31.746 --> 1:23:34.782
Oh, the big guy?

1:23:36.618 --> 1:23:40.287
Yeah well, we've been
recently reacquainted.

1:23:46.460 --> 1:23:49.764
We got lots to be
grateful for, my friend.

1:23:51.666 --> 1:23:53.400
Things could have
been a lot worse.

1:23:58.640 --> 1:23:59.640
Yeah.

1:24:02.644 --> 1:24:04.411
You gotta find
a way to end this.

1:24:07.515 --> 1:24:08.515
I know.

1:24:16.524 --> 1:24:17.524
Florida.

1:24:20.294 --> 1:24:21.328
Go on down and visit.

1:24:24.231 --> 1:24:25.365
I'll keep it warm for ya.

1:24:26.568 --> 1:24:27.568
Florida.

1:24:30.304 --> 1:24:31.304
Yeah.

1:25:30.531 --> 1:25:31.766
Hey, bro.

1:25:38.840 --> 1:25:39.840
Come on.

1:25:42.944 --> 1:25:43.944
Come on.

1:25:46.714 --> 1:25:48.916
I'll be over by the warmth.

1:26:01.996 --> 1:26:05.767
Why'd you want to meet here?

1:26:05.800 --> 1:26:08.603
'Cause this was our place.

1:26:08.636 --> 1:26:11.438
Can't stand to look at
it now, glad it's dark.

1:26:17.679 --> 1:26:19.614
I'm running out of
lives here, man.

1:26:22.550 --> 1:26:23.550
I know.

1:26:31.291 --> 1:26:32.770
I got a guy coming
to town tomorrow night

1:26:32.794 --> 1:26:36.363
with a serious package at H.

1:26:38.599 --> 1:26:42.970
It's way better than that
Mexican horse floating around.

1:26:47.374 --> 1:26:50.712
I don't pay, I'm a dead man.

1:26:52.680 --> 1:26:54.347
I need some money, now.

1:26:54.381 --> 1:26:56.584
How many times
I got to tell you no?

1:26:56.617 --> 1:26:58.452
- Well, I'll-
- No.

1:26:58.485 --> 1:27:00.788
I'll pay you back,
get ya a cut once I sell it.

1:27:00.822 --> 1:27:04.391
Do you understand what
Everett is capable of?

1:27:04.424 --> 1:27:05.860
He's got enough to worry about.

1:27:07.294 --> 1:27:09.429
If little Jodie
Hampton ever wakes up,

1:27:10.598 --> 1:27:14.434
she can tell the whole world
who sold her that dirty tar.

1:27:31.552 --> 1:27:32.620
Look at you.

1:27:40.728 --> 1:27:41.929
Look at you.

1:27:47.535 --> 1:27:52.540
Always the same furrowed brow,
and you're fit to be tied.

1:28:03.084 --> 1:28:05.553
We might as well be 17 again.

1:28:29.610 --> 1:28:31.444
Man, why should I trust you now?

1:28:35.950 --> 1:28:37.384
We were brothers.

1:28:45.593 --> 1:28:47.394
We ain't kin.

1:29:20.595 --> 1:29:23.463
Don't seem like so
long ago, does it?

1:29:30.571 --> 1:29:32.439
It does to me.

1:29:40.181 --> 1:29:42.449
I wish someone told me then,

1:29:47.221 --> 1:29:49.724
given me some goddamn warning.

1:30:01.035 --> 1:30:03.971
Watch out Terry, you
little piece of shit.

1:30:10.678 --> 1:30:11.678
Hey.

1:30:17.218 --> 1:30:18.953
You're the only chance I got.

1:30:21.756 --> 1:30:24.558
Do this for me man,
please, please.

1:30:41.909 --> 1:30:43.511
Hey.

1:30:43.544 --> 1:30:44.812
Hey, hey.

1:30:58.626 --> 1:30:59.961
I'm a fucking failure, man.

1:31:10.204 --> 1:31:12.073
How much you talking?

1:31:12.106 --> 1:31:15.876
Five, five grand.

1:31:23.584 --> 1:31:24.752
- Where?
- Dago.

1:31:27.722 --> 1:31:29.489
Nine o'clock, tomorrow night.

1:31:37.665 --> 1:31:38.966
How's it supposed to go?

1:31:45.740 --> 1:31:48.909
I met this, there's
this boy, Reggie.

1:31:57.051 --> 1:31:58.753
You motherfucker.

1:33:06.887 --> 1:33:08.355
This'll get you out of state.

1:33:15.262 --> 1:33:17.131
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

1:33:17.164 --> 1:33:18.164
No, it wasn't.

1:33:32.980 --> 1:33:33.980
You'll be okay.

1:33:39.453 --> 1:33:40.453
Okay.

1:34:15.389 --> 1:34:16.757
Game's over.

1:34:39.514 --> 1:34:41.015
Hey fuck, man.

1:34:41.048 --> 1:34:42.483
All right, here's Reggie.

1:34:42.517 --> 1:34:44.285
You got the money?

1:34:44.318 --> 1:34:45.953
We're gonna straighten
out a few things.

1:34:45.986 --> 1:34:46.820
Damn right.

1:34:46.854 --> 1:34:47.955
Terry Rose.

1:34:51.158 --> 1:34:53.961
I always forget
how small you are.

1:34:56.463 --> 1:34:58.399
Well hey man, great
seeing you again.

1:34:58.432 --> 1:35:00.734
- What brings-
- Shut your mouth.

1:35:02.236 --> 1:35:03.847
I don't know what the
fuck's going on man.

1:35:03.871 --> 1:35:04.871
Hey, just be cool.

1:35:06.140 --> 1:35:07.841
We're gonna handle
this right now.

1:35:09.043 --> 1:35:10.077
Who the fuck is this?

1:35:10.110 --> 1:35:11.278
Language, son.

1:35:16.083 --> 1:35:17.318
Let's sit down, boys.

1:35:18.419 --> 1:35:20.387
I don't wanna sit down.

1:35:20.421 --> 1:35:21.421
I ain't asking.

1:35:23.023 --> 1:35:24.023
Sit down.

1:35:25.527 --> 1:35:27.361
Tell Everett what
you've been doing.

1:35:28.929 --> 1:35:30.541
I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

1:35:30.565 --> 1:35:32.233
I'm not messing around with you.

1:35:47.114 --> 1:35:49.250
I cooked, I sold, a little.

1:35:54.522 --> 1:35:56.857
Mostly I just scored
on my own stash.

1:35:59.460 --> 1:36:00.828
And here I thought

1:36:00.861 --> 1:36:02.863
you were all cock and no balls.

1:36:08.002 --> 1:36:09.003
I got your money.

1:36:11.606 --> 1:36:14.375
And it's going to your boy
here on behalf of Everett.

1:36:16.877 --> 1:36:18.345
He's gonna make the purchase.

1:36:20.615 --> 1:36:23.350
And you're gonna
leave town tonight.

1:36:26.053 --> 1:36:27.053
You understand me?

1:36:29.423 --> 1:36:32.459
Finally, so which on of you

1:36:32.493 --> 1:36:34.161
is stepping out to
the car with me?

1:36:34.194 --> 1:36:35.362
That'd be me.

1:36:36.363 --> 1:36:39.066
Well let's go make a deal, kid.

1:36:39.099 --> 1:36:40.434
Hold up a goddamn minute,

1:36:40.467 --> 1:36:41.579
I can't just pick up
and fucking leave.

1:36:41.603 --> 1:36:42.903
Terry, it's done.

1:36:44.606 --> 1:36:46.840
Doc here just
purchased your freedom.

1:36:48.610 --> 1:36:52.046
Can't promise what'll happen
is I leave here empty handed.

1:36:52.079 --> 1:36:56.383
Well I think a
small finder's fee

1:36:56.417 --> 1:36:57.351
should at least be applied.

1:36:57.384 --> 1:36:59.253
Finder's fee?

1:36:59.286 --> 1:37:02.156
You boys really know how to
complicate the simplest things.

1:37:06.026 --> 1:37:07.026
Come on, kid.

1:37:09.631 --> 1:37:12.299
Fucking Cole, I
ain't town two months,

1:37:12.333 --> 1:37:14.335
I damn near put on
Everett here, I did.

1:37:17.672 --> 1:37:19.473
Is that what you think.

1:37:19.507 --> 1:37:22.209
It's what I fucking know.

1:37:22.242 --> 1:37:24.378
You've just been a pest.

1:37:24.411 --> 1:37:26.880
Like crabs on a
dick, nothing more.

1:37:26.914 --> 1:37:28.382
Terry, sit the fuck down.

1:37:28.415 --> 1:37:30.518
Listen ladies, y'all
can kiss and make up

1:37:30.552 --> 1:37:33.287
after I'm gone, but let's
do this shit already.

1:37:33.320 --> 1:37:35.055
Watch your mouth, stranger.

1:37:35.089 --> 1:37:36.524
Get the fuck out of my face.

1:37:36.558 --> 1:37:38.626
You just lost all
value to me, punk!

1:37:38.660 --> 1:37:41.395
Everett, he's a kid,
he's a kid, Everett.

1:37:41.428 --> 1:37:44.298
Get your
hands up and turn around!

1:37:44.331 --> 1:37:45.199
This is on you!

1:37:45.232 --> 1:37:46.232
No, no, no!

1:37:47.134 --> 1:37:49.403
Hands up, hands up!

1:37:51.171 --> 1:37:55.175
Drop to your knees,
lay flat, lay flat.

1:38:37.752 --> 1:38:40.020
Shit, is that one dead?

1:38:40.053 --> 1:38:45.058
God knows, some
local, Gary, or Jerry something.

1:38:47.461 --> 1:38:49.296
This ones down.

1:38:57.772 --> 1:38:59.273
We got him, boys.

1:39:16.023 --> 1:39:17.291
You all right?

1:39:17.324 --> 1:39:20.494
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

1:39:20.528 --> 1:39:22.362
We did our best, Cole.

1:41:02.864 --> 1:41:04.431
I didn't know what you liked

1:41:04.464 --> 1:41:07.434
so I just made what I know how.

1:41:10.738 --> 1:41:12.472
I'll get you a
little more bacon.

1:41:16.343 --> 1:41:17.343
All right.

1:41:48.241 --> 1:41:49.476
You curious about your daddy?

1:41:51.579 --> 1:41:52.747
Mama ever tell you anything?

1:41:55.883 --> 1:41:57.451
Did you know him?

1:41:57.484 --> 1:41:59.453
Of course I knew him.

1:42:01.188 --> 1:42:05.192
Last I heard he was in South
Carolina, John Milligan.

1:42:08.896 --> 1:42:10.263
- All right.
- Okay.

1:42:21.809 --> 1:42:23.845
I'm sorry, I'm just
not that hungry is all.

1:42:23.878 --> 1:42:25.947
Nah, no, it tastes like shit.

1:42:43.330 --> 1:42:45.399
I gotta go talk
to grandma for a bit.

1:42:45.432 --> 1:42:46.432
Yeah.

1:42:49.003 --> 1:42:50.470
Oh, just a minute though.

1:42:55.610 --> 1:42:58.445
For kindling, or
you know, whatever.

1:42:58.478 --> 1:42:59.781
- Yeah, thanks.
- Yeah.

1:43:03.851 --> 1:43:04.851
Please write.

1:43:07.287 --> 1:43:09.456
- I will.
- More than I did, okay?

1:43:12.627 --> 1:43:13.594
Where should I send them?

1:43:13.628 --> 1:43:14.628
Right here.

1:43:16.263 --> 1:43:17.263
Here's fine.

1:43:27.842 --> 1:43:32.847
He asked for you, you know,
you were the one he wanted.

1:43:38.519 --> 1:43:40.487
Maybe he was asking forgiveness.
