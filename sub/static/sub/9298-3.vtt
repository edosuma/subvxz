01:49.924 --> 01:52.492
Hey!

01:52.527 --> 01:55.495
Oh, leave them alone!

01:55.530 --> 01:57.564
They're serving
our country!

01:57.598 --> 02:00.834
Ma, Maura and I are actually the
only people who can hear you.

02:00.868 --> 02:02.235
Poor boys.
They need a little fun.

02:02.270 --> 02:05.272
It's Fleet Week.

02:05.306 --> 02:07.574
Yeah, poor boys need to learn
how to hold their alcohol.

02:07.608 --> 02:09.976
God, I can't wait for these guys
to be gone in three days.

02:10.011 --> 02:12.212
Roosevelt endorsed
the first Fleet Week in 1935.

02:12.246 --> 02:15.015
He was intent
in expanding the Navy.

02:15.049 --> 02:16.750
Oh, he's cute.

02:16.784 --> 02:19.019
Yeah. Move along. Move along.
She's too young for you.

02:19.053 --> 02:20.987
Goodbye.

02:21.022 --> 02:23.490
I really want to thank you
for taking me to brunch.

02:23.524 --> 02:26.960
I know you have better things
to do on a Sunday morning.

02:26.994 --> 02:28.695
- Come on.
- Don't be silly.

02:28.730 --> 02:30.197
I mean,
what could be more fun

02:30.231 --> 02:32.532
than taking out
your broke, homeless mother,

02:32.567 --> 02:34.167
who's been dumped
by your father?

02:34.202 --> 02:36.770
Ma, stop.
Come on.

02:36.804 --> 02:37.838
Oh!

02:37.872 --> 02:40.474
My car is breaking down,
too?!

02:40.508 --> 02:43.443
It's the only thing in my life
that's been working!

02:43.478 --> 02:44.644
I'm sure it's fine.

02:44.679 --> 02:46.346
Or not.

02:46.380 --> 02:48.148
Come on, Maura.
Big push.

02:48.182 --> 02:50.183
We're gonna push?
We're gonna push.

02:50.218 --> 02:52.052
Oh, good thing
I wore my wedges.

02:53.087 --> 02:55.021
Uh, it's okay, ma'am.
We can push.

02:55.056 --> 02:56.757
Oh!

02:56.791 --> 02:57.924
All right.
Thanks.

02:57.959 --> 03:00.026
Thank you. Ooh.
He's cute, too.

03:00.061 --> 03:03.430
He called me "ma'am."
Ma, scoot over.

03:03.464 --> 03:06.633
Do you think they could
push us to Gilberti's Garage?

03:06.667 --> 03:08.902
It's so close.

03:08.936 --> 03:11.705
Female commissioned officers
are addressed as "ma'am."

03:11.739 --> 03:13.440
It's a sign of respect.

03:13.474 --> 03:14.941
"Sir" is
a sign of respect.

03:14.976 --> 03:18.211
"Ma'am" is for
fat, old cat ladies.

03:18.246 --> 03:20.147
Are you talking
about me?

03:20.181 --> 03:22.149
Do you have a cat?

03:22.183 --> 03:25.018
No.

03:35.830 --> 03:37.898
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, ma'am.

03:37.932 --> 03:39.199
See what I mean?

03:39.233 --> 03:40.233
No.

03:40.268 --> 03:42.269
- Hello?
- Yeah, hang on.

03:43.304 --> 03:44.838
Giovanni?

03:44.872 --> 03:47.908
Hey!
Where's your father?

03:47.942 --> 03:50.443
Ah, he's down in Florida.
No, no, I'll get grease on you.

03:50.478 --> 03:52.979
- Oh, it's okay!
- Wow. Look at his shoulder-to-hip ratio.

03:53.014 --> 03:55.816
Lengthy metacarpals --
you know what that means.

03:55.850 --> 03:56.416
Mnh-mnh.

03:57.218 --> 03:58.885
Hey.
How you doin'?

03:58.920 --> 04:00.887
Great.
You look hot as ever.

04:00.922 --> 04:02.155
<i>Doesn't</i> she?

04:02.190 --> 04:04.658
Ah, your ma --
nicest lady on the block.

04:04.692 --> 04:06.626
I swear to God, I'll never forget
your chocolate-chip cookies.

04:06.661 --> 04:09.129
- Oh.
- Come on.

04:09.163 --> 04:10.831
This is my friend
Dr. Isles.

04:12.033 --> 04:15.802
You can call me "Maura."
I-I don't mind a little grease.

04:17.605 --> 04:20.106
Uh, what's, you know,
a little grease between friends?

04:20.141 --> 04:21.975
Ma's car died.

04:22.009 --> 04:23.877
It sounds to me like
the water-pump bearing.

04:23.911 --> 04:26.213
Look at you,
all "My Cousin Vinny."

04:26.247 --> 04:28.014
Love that.

04:30.751 --> 04:32.719
- He's hot.
- It's hot?

04:32.753 --> 04:36.122
Uh, the -- the car.
It's -- it's running hot.

04:36.157 --> 04:38.525
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You're losing some coolant here.

04:38.559 --> 04:41.701
You were always so handy.
W-wasn't he, Jane?

04:41.726 --> 04:42.762
Ma, stop.

04:42.763 --> 04:45.131
And taking over
for your father like this --

04:45.166 --> 04:47.834
that's a good son.

04:47.869 --> 04:49.502
Right, Jane?

04:49.537 --> 04:51.037
Good sons make good...

04:51.072 --> 04:53.240
Good <i>mechanics,</i> Ma?

04:56.644 --> 04:58.578
Rizzoli.

04:58.613 --> 05:01.481
Looks like more than just
a pump. Could take a while.

05:01.515 --> 05:03.817
Do you think I could get
the friends-and-family discount?

05:04.886 --> 05:07.654
You got it, Mrs. Rizzoli.
Oh!

05:07.688 --> 05:09.489
Thank you!

05:09.523 --> 05:11.157
Oh.
, we have to leave.

05:11.192 --> 05:13.460
Um, I wish I could stay and
help you pull the front cover.

05:13.494 --> 05:15.695
- Let's go.
- How?

05:15.730 --> 05:18.398
We don't have a car.
We'll take a taxi.

05:18.432 --> 05:20.166
<i>We</i> are not going
to the crime scene.

05:20.201 --> 05:21.601
<i>We</i> are going home.

05:21.636 --> 05:23.803
Since you're a gearhead
like me,

05:23.838 --> 05:25.272
take Julietta.

05:28.209 --> 05:30.944
- Oh!
- Restored her myself.

05:30.978 --> 05:33.713
- I would love that!
- N-- uh...

05:33.748 --> 05:35.181
Cool!

05:35.216 --> 05:39.185
I would love that.

05:39.220 --> 05:40.020
1975 was a great year.

05:40.054 --> 05:42.722
No.
Stay away from Giovanni.

05:42.757 --> 05:44.457
"No"?

05:44.492 --> 05:46.459
Oh,this is a 'dibs' thing.

05:46.494 --> 05:47.928
"A dibs thing"?
Really?

05:47.962 --> 05:50.096
Okay, tell me what
you have in common with him.

05:50.131 --> 05:51.998
All right,
he's a blue-collar...

05:54.268 --> 05:56.136
...Boston-Italian
auto mechanic.

05:56.170 --> 05:58.171
Well, so are you.

05:58.205 --> 05:59.239
Well, except for being
an auto mechanic.

05:59.273 --> 06:01.374
And we're best friends.

06:01.409 --> 06:04.477
Yes,
but I'm <i>interesting.</i>

06:04.512 --> 06:06.913
And you don't want to
sleep with me.

06:07.815 --> 06:10.083
<i>Do</i> you?

06:10.117 --> 06:11.351
No.

06:11.385 --> 06:12.852
No!
But that's my point.

06:12.887 --> 06:15.288
That's <i>all</i> I want to do
with Giovanni.

06:15.323 --> 06:17.924
I just don't
really think

06:17.959 --> 06:20.193
you have the patience
for Giovanni's type.

06:20.227 --> 06:21.494
Well, what's his type?

06:21.529 --> 06:23.797
Fun...
Till he starts to talk.

06:23.831 --> 06:26.967
Sweet.
Where'd you get that Alfa?

06:27.001 --> 06:28.902
"Lookin' hot."

06:28.936 --> 06:31.004
What do we got?

06:31.038 --> 06:32.706
White female,
badly beaten --

06:32.740 --> 06:35.675
badly beaten,
possibly raped.

06:35.710 --> 06:37.877
Brenda Martin,
21 years old,

06:37.912 --> 06:39.212
Somerville address.

06:39.246 --> 06:41.081
Homeless guy looking
for bottles found her.

06:42.984 --> 06:45.485
Initial
external examination

06:45.519 --> 06:47.220
indicates
likely sexual assault.

06:48.923 --> 06:50.957
Navy issue.

06:50.992 --> 06:53.960
She was wearing it.
There's a blond hair inside.

06:53.995 --> 06:56.730
Navy? We got thousands
of sailors in town.

06:56.764 --> 06:58.898
Only time I envied sailors --
Fleet Week.

06:58.933 --> 07:00.700
Don't they have
<i>Marine</i> Week?

07:00.735 --> 07:01.868
Do now. Didn't then.
I was gypped.

07:01.902 --> 07:03.770
That's a racial slur.

07:03.804 --> 07:05.805
Racial slur?

07:05.840 --> 07:07.474
Against
fortune-tellers?

07:07.508 --> 07:09.275
Actually,
that's another racial slur.

07:10.044 --> 07:12.645
That's odd.

07:12.680 --> 07:13.813
What appears to be orange juice
on her collar.

07:13.848 --> 07:15.548
Now look at her cheek.

07:15.583 --> 07:18.518
Face paint --
red, white, and blue.

07:18.552 --> 07:20.353
- Probably an American flag.
- Mm.

07:20.388 --> 07:21.688
Dust along the handle
and door...

07:21.722 --> 07:23.957
Please don't tell me she came
out of the Dirty Robber.

07:23.991 --> 07:24.791
Figures.

07:24.825 --> 07:26.126
Swabbies
can't even leave us

07:26.160 --> 07:28.828
one little corner
during Fleet Week.

07:28.863 --> 07:30.597
I'll stand by
with the crime-scene techs.

07:30.631 --> 07:32.432
Well,
I'm coming with you.

07:32.466 --> 07:34.401
Why?

07:34.435 --> 07:36.002
You are not
the boss of me.

07:36.037 --> 07:38.505
If I want to go out with Giovanni,
I will go out with him.

07:38.539 --> 07:41.408
But right now,
I-I have to pee.

07:41.442 --> 07:45.412
Cute blond girl?
There were a bunch of them here.

07:45.446 --> 07:47.680
What about one with an American
flag painted on her cheek?

07:47.715 --> 07:49.983
I was too busy
making Fuzzy Navels.

07:50.017 --> 07:51.684
Fuzzy Navels?
Mm-hmm.

07:51.719 --> 07:55.188
Peach schnapps, O.J.,
lemonade -- chick drink.

07:55.222 --> 07:57.924
Sell gallons of it
with the Navy boys in town.

07:57.958 --> 07:59.759
O.J. on her collar.

07:59.794 --> 08:01.127
Huh.
Well, try to remember.

08:01.162 --> 08:04.964
She was 5'2", cute,
blond, face paint...

08:04.999 --> 08:06.566
Drinking Fuzzy Navels.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.835
- Mm.
- Anything ring a bell, Slick?

08:08.869 --> 08:11.638
Well, now that you
put it so nicely,

08:11.672 --> 08:12.939
there was one couple.

08:12.973 --> 08:15.775
I remember him
because he did

08:15.810 --> 08:16.943
that famous sailor kiss
with her.

08:16.977 --> 08:19.179
The iconic image
photographed

08:19.213 --> 08:22.115
by Alfred Eisenstaedt
on V-J Day.

08:23.717 --> 08:25.218
Yeah, that's the one.

08:27.121 --> 08:28.822
Didn't you have
an emergency?

08:28.856 --> 08:30.657
Yes, I did.

08:32.493 --> 08:34.527
- Can you describe the guy for us?
- Well, sure.

08:34.562 --> 08:38.498
Young, crew cut,
wearing a white uniform.

08:38.532 --> 08:41.067
That help you?

08:42.635 --> 08:43.970
Not so much.

08:47.704 --> 08:51.269
Fractures to the ethmoid,
lacrimal, and zygomatic bones.

08:51.694 --> 08:52.934
Cause of death?

08:52.984 --> 08:54.184
She was strangled.

08:54.926 --> 08:57.395
Rape kit.

08:57.429 --> 08:58.896
Positive for semen.

08:58.930 --> 09:01.966
Severe vaginal bruising
and tearing.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.734
So, she <i>was</i> raped.

09:03.769 --> 09:06.137
I'll get this to the lab,
have them run the profile

09:06.171 --> 09:08.172
through CODIS and the Department
of Defense DNA Registry.

09:08.206 --> 09:09.874
That D.O.D. databank
was intended

09:09.908 --> 09:11.709
to identify
soldiers' remains,

09:11.743 --> 09:13.878
not to find
sexual predators.

09:13.912 --> 09:16.414
I'd hate to think a Navy man
would do this.

09:17.549 --> 09:19.583
I'm gonna get a burger
at that new place on Boylston.

09:19.618 --> 09:22.420
You want one?
I'll just get a sandwich at the café.

09:22.454 --> 09:24.922
I wouldn't. Place is a disaster
since Stanley took over.

09:24.956 --> 09:26.524
Stanley
from the Post Office?

09:26.558 --> 09:29.960
He's got a cousin
in personnel.

09:29.995 --> 09:31.495
Yeah, I' help pay
to fix her car,

09:31.530 --> 09:33.631
but what are we gonna do
about <i>her?</i>

09:33.665 --> 09:35.766
She's never worked a day in
her life. I have no idea.

09:35.801 --> 09:38.135
She took care of <i>us.</i>

09:38.170 --> 09:40.871
Okay, I'm not saying that we
make her live in a refrigerator box.

09:40.906 --> 09:43.574
I'm just saying, you know,
she needs to be busy.

09:43.608 --> 09:45.776
She needs to do something
so she feels good about herself.

09:45.811 --> 09:47.645
- Oh, she needs a job.
- Yeah.

09:47.679 --> 09:49.647
Out of bagels,
out of toast.

09:49.681 --> 09:51.074
We stop serving
breakfast at 8:00.

09:51.075 --> 09:52.616
You could use some help
telling time, Stanley.

09:52.641 --> 09:53.841
Get in line.

09:54.252 --> 09:56.554
You gonna stand there,
or you gonna order something?

09:56.588 --> 09:58.722
- Nice customer service.
- Yeah? Thanks!

09:58.757 --> 10:00.791
You could also use some help
with the coffee.

10:00.826 --> 10:03.828
May I suggest taking your dirty
socks out of the coffee pot?

10:03.862 --> 10:05.863
You don't like it,
go someplace else, Rizzoli.

10:05.897 --> 10:07.765
- You know --
- Don't tick him off.

10:07.799 --> 10:09.967
Anthrax came through
the postal service.

10:10.001 --> 10:13.204
Hey, you know the Fleet Week
killer you guys are working?

10:13.238 --> 10:14.472
Who's calling him <i>that?</i>

10:16.508 --> 10:17.675
I want in.

10:17.709 --> 10:20.211
You want in
on my homicide?

10:20.245 --> 10:22.346
I need more experience
before the detective's exam.

10:22.380 --> 10:24.248
I-I'll do grunt work,
whatever you want.

10:24.282 --> 10:25.483
Huh?

10:25.517 --> 10:27.284
Vomit.

10:27.319 --> 10:28.486
I hate carnations!

10:28.520 --> 10:29.954
Jane,
there you are.

10:29.988 --> 10:31.722
Here I am.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.724
I, uh --
hey, Frankie.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.926
Hey, Giovanni.
How you doin'?

10:35.961 --> 10:37.928
So, uh,
I was wondering --

10:37.963 --> 10:40.598
If I have a boyfriend.
Yes. I do.

10:40.632 --> 10:42.700
It's --
it's very serious.

10:42.734 --> 10:44.802
You <i>do?</i>

10:44.836 --> 10:47.605
If you could tell me
where to find Maura.

10:47.639 --> 10:49.039
Huh?

10:55.680 --> 10:59.517
Giovanni, come in.
Uh, what are you doing here?

10:59.551 --> 11:02.620
How'd you get stuck
with all this old stuff?

11:03.755 --> 11:04.755
You look hot.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.590
- Thank you.
- For you.

11:06.625 --> 11:09.793
Oh, uh,
I'm the one that owes you

11:09.828 --> 11:12.296
for letting me drive
your Alfa.

11:12.330 --> 11:13.731
You can keep Julietta
as long as you like.

11:13.765 --> 11:15.332
Oh, no, I-I couldn't.

11:15.367 --> 11:19.103
Um, actually, here you go.
Thank you.

11:20.872 --> 11:22.239
Thank you.
Excuse me.

11:22.274 --> 11:24.275
We're just in the middle
of a new case.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.776
Oh, sure.
I'll let you get back to it.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.778
Can you give my estimate
to Mrs. Rizzoli?

11:27.812 --> 11:29.613
I-I'm just charging her
for parts.

11:29.648 --> 11:31.315
That's very nice of you.

11:31.349 --> 11:35.452
I'm not just being nice.
I want to take you out.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.588
Listen,
you like Italian?

11:37.622 --> 11:39.690
I love Italians.

11:39.724 --> 11:43.861
<i>Italian.</i> Northern Italian.
Southern, too.

11:43.895 --> 11:45.429
And the food.

11:45.463 --> 11:46.997
Let me take you
to dinner.

11:47.032 --> 11:49.500
Oh, it would be faster
if you come to my house.

11:49.534 --> 11:50.868
Faster?

11:50.902 --> 11:53.938
For me.
For me.

11:53.972 --> 11:55.906
Because I work
really long hours.

11:55.941 --> 11:57.975
- Yeah.
- I love hot women who can cook.

11:58.009 --> 12:00.044
Okay.

12:00.078 --> 12:01.879
Oh, nice.

12:01.913 --> 12:04.381
This guy.

12:04.416 --> 12:06.150
Ugh!

12:06.184 --> 12:06.917
Ooh.

12:08.720 --> 12:11.488
God.

12:20.298 --> 12:22.100
Uh, Sergeant Korsak,
there was a match

12:22.101 --> 12:23.798
on the DNA semen
that we found in the victim.

12:24.469 --> 12:27.404
I'm afraid
it <i>is</i> a sailor.

12:30.842 --> 12:32.843
Yes, ma'am,
I-I met her at the bar,

12:32.877 --> 12:34.311
but I did not do that.

12:34.346 --> 12:37.481
- What <i>did</i> you do?
- We partied, but...

12:37.515 --> 12:39.450
You partied?
Meaning what?

12:39.484 --> 12:42.386
- We had sex, sir.
- You just met her.

12:42.420 --> 12:45.456
Look, I know how this sounds,
ma'am, but I did not hurt her.

12:45.490 --> 12:46.824
I <i>liked</i> her.

12:48.360 --> 12:49.860
She was nice.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.428
D.A. wants him held
on an aggravated-rape charge.

12:51.463 --> 12:54.331
Wait, but --
but I didn't do it.

12:54.366 --> 12:55.366
Look--

12:55.400 --> 12:57.635
my ship is gonna leave.

12:57.669 --> 12:59.570
We cooperated
with your questioning.

12:59.604 --> 13:01.338
But if you think the Navy's just
gonna give you this sailor --

13:01.373 --> 13:02.339
it's not
up to the Navy.

13:02.374 --> 13:04.074
This is outside
of military jurisdiction.

13:05.443 --> 13:07.077
Let's go, sailor.

13:16.788 --> 13:17.688
Detective Frost.

13:17.722 --> 13:19.657
I have a Navy Admiral
here to see you.

13:21.660 --> 13:24.662
I got this,
Sergeant Detective.

13:25.797 --> 13:29.199
Dad, what are you
doing here?

13:29.234 --> 13:30.534
I'm here for
the immediate release

13:30.568 --> 13:31.802
of Petty Officer Salerno.

13:31.836 --> 13:33.404
Yeah,
nice to see you, too.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.906
And to inform you
that your superiors

13:35.940 --> 13:38.609
must exonerate
the United States Navy

13:38.643 --> 13:41.645
from involvement
in these unfortunate events.

13:41.680 --> 13:45.716
You see this badge?
It's a Detective's badge.

13:45.750 --> 13:49.420
But right now,
this badge outranks your star.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.689
Don't make this
personal, son.

13:51.723 --> 13:54.224
It's not personal.

13:54.259 --> 13:55.759
Need I remind you...

13:55.794 --> 13:59.096
Fleet Week is
a very lucrative endeavor.

13:59.130 --> 14:00.464
It'll be a great loss
to your city

14:00.498 --> 14:02.366
if it were to be held
elsewhere.

14:02.400 --> 14:06.637
I'm pretty sure
we'll manage that loss, <i>Sir.</i>

14:08.139 --> 14:11.408
It's too bad we couldn't
settle this like men.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.559
Are we the oldest people here?

14:28.593 --> 14:30.728
From the two gentlemen
at the bar.

14:34.566 --> 14:36.300
My hand hurts
from waving.

14:36.334 --> 14:39.970
What are they, 13?
They both have acne.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.105
I think the dark-haired one
has braces.

14:41.139 --> 14:44.274
I'll use the next one
to water the plants.

14:44.309 --> 14:46.143
No, I don't like
to be rude.

14:46.177 --> 14:49.646
Is that why you took Giovanni's
velveteen box of chocolates?

14:49.681 --> 14:52.549
What'd he get you,
a stuffed rabbit, too?

14:52.584 --> 14:54.284
- He's sweet.
- Ugh!

14:54.319 --> 14:57.554
Umbrellas in drinks
started in the 1930s.

14:57.589 --> 14:59.823
Anything Polynesian was
considered wildly exotic.

14:59.858 --> 15:03.160
Unlike Giovanni --
wildly dull.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.462
Why would you say
you'd have dinner with him?

15:05.497 --> 15:08.065
Because he has
a spectacular torso,

15:08.099 --> 15:09.700
and he's giving your mom
a great deal on her car repair.

15:09.734 --> 15:12.336
Oh. Well, in that case,
play with him all you like.

15:13.671 --> 15:16.140
Hey, Jane.
We got a second rape victim.

15:16.574 --> 15:17.775
Korsak says same M.O.

15:17.809 --> 15:19.443
Salerno's in lockup.

15:19.477 --> 15:20.744
Not anymore, he's not.

15:20.779 --> 15:22.913
Admiral Frost bailed him out
two hours ago.

15:22.947 --> 15:25.249
Admiral Frost?

15:31.842 --> 15:33.307
You sure it's Frost's father?

15:33.332 --> 15:35.393
- Ah.
- Yeah, well, Admiral Frost

15:35.442 --> 15:37.637
he got a lot of juice to get
bail on a murder suspect.

15:37.638 --> 15:39.872
- This rape is on him.
- Janey.

15:40.010 --> 15:41.744
What do we got?

15:41.778 --> 15:42.912
Dog walker found her.

15:42.946 --> 15:44.614
You all right?

15:44.648 --> 15:46.816
We got a sailor
raping women.

15:46.850 --> 15:48.985
Frost,
it's not your fault.

15:49.019 --> 15:51.053
My father sprung him,
Jane.

15:51.088 --> 15:53.222
- It's on me.
- Come on.

15:53.257 --> 15:54.590
Pulse is
weak and thready.

15:54.625 --> 15:55.858
She's still alive.

15:55.892 --> 15:58.561
Paramedic went to pronounce her,
found a pulse.

15:58.595 --> 15:59.709
She was dumped here.

15:59.710 --> 16:01.077
You find any
personal belongings?

16:01.111 --> 16:03.279
Nothing.
Swept the area.

16:03.313 --> 16:05.448
Look what
he left behind.

16:05.482 --> 16:07.316
Piece of a blue surgical bootie,
which mean..

16:07.351 --> 16:08.885
He was all about
making sure

16:08.919 --> 16:10.420
he didn't leave behind
any footprints or DNA.

16:10.454 --> 16:12.588
Second victim's
the same M.O. --

16:12.623 --> 16:15.124
white, petite,
20-something.

16:15.159 --> 16:16.859
If it's Salerno,

16:16.894 --> 16:18.961
he's a serial rapist
and a murderer.

16:18.996 --> 16:21.264
She's lucky
to be alive.

16:21.298 --> 16:23.266
Near-freezing temperature
of the mud

16:23.300 --> 16:25.401
reduced brain swelling,
saved her life.

16:25.436 --> 16:26.602
What kind of life,
though?

16:26.637 --> 16:28.604
Too soon to know.

16:32.342 --> 16:34.610
Thanks.

16:53.737 --> 16:55.935
- Did you do a rape kit yet?
- Yes.

16:55.936 --> 16:58.070
Injuries are consistent
with a violent rape,

16:58.105 --> 16:59.905
but there's no evidence
of semen.

16:59.940 --> 17:01.474
So, this time,
he wore a condom.

17:03.009 --> 17:05.111
God, she looks bad.

17:05.145 --> 17:07.313
The MRI shows bleeding
on her brain.

17:07.347 --> 17:09.415
It's not looking good.

17:11.617 --> 17:15.154
Did you see this?

17:15.188 --> 17:17.356
What is that?

17:17.390 --> 17:19.325
Looks like some kind
of an abrasion on the skin

17:19.358 --> 17:21.160
left by an impression.

17:21.194 --> 17:24.797
- Impression of what?
- I'd have to do comparison testing.

17:25.898 --> 17:28.099
Looks like a zipper,
Maura.

17:35.475 --> 17:37.643
Can you hear me?

17:37.677 --> 17:40.246
My name is
Detective Jane Rizzoli.

17:40.280 --> 17:43.516
You're in the hospital.
You're safe.

17:43.550 --> 17:45.117
And we're gonna
keep you safe,

17:45.152 --> 17:47.153
and we're gonna find
who did this to you.

17:54.261 --> 17:56.495
Hey, sweetie.
Mm.

17:56.530 --> 17:58.697
What's your name?
Can you tell me your name?

18:01.001 --> 18:02.768
It's dark.

18:02.803 --> 18:06.705
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
It's okay. You're safe.

18:06.740 --> 18:07.006
You're safe.

18:07.040 --> 18:10.009
No. Stop.

18:10.043 --> 18:13.179
Dolphins.

18:13.213 --> 18:16.448
All the dolphins.

18:16.483 --> 18:20.553
It's okay, baby.
Nobody's gonna hurt you here.

18:20.587 --> 18:23.589
Blue light.

18:25.192 --> 18:27.960
I see blue.

18:27.994 --> 18:30.529
Blue light.

18:34.034 --> 18:37.036
Why?

18:45.078 --> 18:46.478
What do you think?

18:46.513 --> 18:48.981
I think it's a matter
of time, Jane.

18:49.015 --> 18:51.383
We've got to find Salerno.

18:51.418 --> 18:53.285
I don't want any more
of these girls.

18:53.320 --> 18:56.021
"Homey,
I need a boner."

18:56.056 --> 18:57.423
What?!

18:57.457 --> 19:00.125
Spelling errata.

19:00.160 --> 19:02.194
Your mother really
should proof-read.

19:02.229 --> 19:04.230
It's "Honey,
I need a loaner."

19:04.264 --> 19:06.198
Where's her car,
Maura.

19:06.233 --> 19:08.934
Until Giovanni fixes it,
I'm her own personal chauffeur.

19:08.969 --> 19:11.136
Well, he's doing it
at cost, Jane.

19:11.171 --> 19:13.172
He's doing it
to get laid, Maura.

19:13.206 --> 19:16.775
Oh. Okay,
it'll be ready tomorrow.

19:16.810 --> 19:18.510
Hey, ladies, you want one?

19:18.545 --> 19:20.079
No, thanks, man.

19:20.113 --> 19:22.047
It's Dragon Fire! Free samples.
They're great.

19:22.082 --> 19:23.082
- Rizzoli.
- Thank you.

19:23.116 --> 19:24.383
Don't be rude.

19:24.417 --> 19:26.051
We found
Petty Officer Salerno.

19:26.086 --> 19:27.253
Oh, that's great,
Frost.

19:27.287 --> 19:28.520
Not really.

19:28.555 --> 19:29.955
He has an alibi
for the second victim.

19:29.990 --> 19:32.191
- How solid?
- Rock-solid.

19:32.225 --> 19:34.326
At least my father
had that part right.

19:34.361 --> 19:36.862
Salerno was on the ship,
locked up in the brig.

19:36.897 --> 19:38.397
So, this predator
is still out there.

19:38.431 --> 19:40.466
I'm having BRIC track every port
these ships have been to,

19:40.500 --> 19:42.601
cross-reference with NCIC.
Good idea.

19:42.636 --> 19:45.070
See
