Well, the man was clearly

He must have escaped while
the queen was being sedated.

We have to find him.

what did this man look like?

- Um... orange.

- Mmm. And curly.

Well, frizzy, actually.
Frizzy sort of thing.

- Frizzy.
- An eye patch.

- Which cheek?
- Both cheeks.

about this, English?

Good morning, gentlemen.
Thank you very much for waiting.

18:23.048 --> 18:27.508
Now, the question that faces us
this morning is a simple one.

18:27.586 --> 18:32.182
Namely, how did the thieves gain access
to this highly secure environment...

18:32.258 --> 18:35.625
and then escape
with thejewels afterwards?

18:35.694 --> 18:40.688

which I believe has a complex answer.

- Actually, sir--
- Uh, please, Bough. My mind is at work.

18:44.103 --> 18:47.129
Now, what you must grasp, gentlemen,
is that the master criminal...

18:47.206 --> 18:51.609
sees not a room
but a series of opportunities.

18:51.677 --> 18:54.043
Should I go in
through the window?

18:54.113 --> 18:56.138
Possibly.

18:56.215 --> 19:00.777
- Should I drop down from the ceiling?
- Actually, sir--

19:00.853 --> 19:04.789
There's one thing I think
we can be fairly confident about,

19:04.857 --> 19:07.519
that is that they didn't
come up through the floor--

19:07.593 --> 19:09.823
I've got you, sir.

19:09.895 --> 19:12.693
That's all right.
Just come my way, Bough.

19:12.765 --> 19:16.565
- That'll bring me
right over the hole, sir.
- There's no need to panic.

Can you see
the bottom yet, Bough?

19:22.274 --> 19:25.243
Not yet, sir. The shaft
appears to be narrowing.

19:25.311 --> 19:28.303
I'm just a little bit worried
I might get stuck.

19:28.380 --> 19:32.077

get stuck if you just keep moving.

now, Bough?

somewhere.

20:26.171 --> 20:28.435
There's nothing
to worry about, Bough.

- It may be pitch black,
but we can still see.
- Can we, sir? How?

20:32.678 --> 20:35.476
The Bedouin monks of

of sonic chanting.

20:38.050 --> 20:40.814
- I see, sir.
- The sound of their chanting...

20:40.886 --> 20:43.150
would bounce back
off any obstacles,

20:43.222 --> 20:44.587
and using their
highly tuned ears...
