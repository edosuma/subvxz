WEBVTT

00:02.050 --> 00:04.570
how do we know  where we belong?

00:04.740 --> 00:09.800
We define ourselves  by our connections with
others,with people we see  and interact with every day.

00:09.970 --> 00:15.650
she packed my bags last night,preflight

00:16.180 --> 00:20.580
zero hour,9:00 A.M.

00:23.490 --> 00:27.540
And I'm gonna be high

00:28.600 --> 00:31.480
as a kite by then

00:37.380 --> 00:40.050
I miss the earth so much

00:40.150 --> 00:43.450
I miss my wife

00:45.230 --> 00:47.550
it's lonely out in space

00:47.610 --> 00:49.820
tyler!

00:50.810 --> 00:56.180
On such a timeless flight

01:04.780 --> 01:08.460
and I think it's gonna
be a long,long time

01:08.610 --> 01:11.810
till touchdown brings
me 'round again to find

01:11.990 --> 01:14.820
I'm not the man they think I am at home

01:14.920 --> 01:17.700
oh,no,no,no

01:17.760 --> 01:20.940
I'm a rocket man

01:21.390 --> 01:26.890
rocket man   burnin' out
his fuse up here alone

01:32.400 --> 01:37.410
and I think it's gonna
be  a long,long time

01:37.830 --> 01:40.530
sam,you've been the victim of violence.

01:40.680 --> 01:47.520
There is a reason the department orders officers sho in
the line of duty to undergo psychological evaluationS.

01:48.010 --> 01:53.750
It's because we often have unpredictable
reactions to stressful situations.

01:54.830 --> 02:00.700
I know.But what I just
discussed... was just a dream.

02:00.830 --> 02:01.940
You understand?

02:02.100 --> 02:03.600
A dream of being frozen in time.

02:03.660 --> 02:05.850
Actually,everyone else was frozen.

02:05.900 --> 02:09.110
I-I was kinda,you know,movin' around.

02:09.160 --> 02:12.410
That is textbook post-trauma behavior.

02:12.530 --> 02:14.030
You've put up emotional wallS.

02:14.070 --> 02:16.620
You are reluant,even
frightened,to let people in.

02:16.690 --> 02:18.770
Isn't that right?

02:18.890 --> 02:21.790
Maybe?I-I don't--
I don't know.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.560
You need to tear down these walls,sam.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.170
Reach out to people you care about.

02:26.220 --> 02:29.110
Let them into your world.You're
not in hyde anymore.

02:29.380 --> 02:33.150
It's time to start making
this place feel like home.

02:38.920 --> 02:40.630
I guess he made sense.

02:40.660 --> 02:43.690
Maybe I should start acting  like I'm
gonna stick around for a while,you know?

02:43.930 --> 02:46.840
You know,that's great,sam.

02:47.020 --> 02:49.720
Seems like you're working
out a lot of your issues.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.580
Issues.You think I have issues?

02:51.760 --> 02:53.980
I think you have more
issues than "life" magazine.

02:54.950 --> 02:57.320
- that's funny,annie.
- I know.

02:57.450 --> 03:03.290
Hey,I was thinking,maybe we could
go for a cappuccino sometime.

03:03.840 --> 03:08.510
If I knew what a cappuccino
was,I might say yes.

03:08.830 --> 03:11.590
It's just fancy coffee.

03:11.650 --> 03:14.850
Cappuccino.Do they drink
those a lot in 2008?

03:15.060 --> 03:17.330
Mm,it's more of a '90s thing.

03:18.650 --> 03:20.810
hey,annie.

03:20.880 --> 03:29.150
Uh... I just,um... you know,after everything
that's happened and being here in 19,

03:29.380 --> 03:33.630
uh... new york...

03:35.920 --> 03:38.410
you've been a good friend.

03:39.120 --> 03:42.430
You too,sam.

03:46.340 --> 03:50.500
as junior cub scout around here,skelton,you're
losing a merit badge over this.

03:51.640 --> 03:55.660
All the closed-circuit places that are showing
the fight have been sold out for a month,you know?

03:55.710 --> 03:59.940
No excuse.We've only been talking
about this since norton-ali I.

04:00.110 --> 04:02.030
You should've been on top of this.

04:02.180 --> 04:04.420
What about you,tyler?You get
your ticket to "broken jaw"?

04:04.630 --> 04:08.040
Mm,no.I got a feeling ali's
already got this one in the bag.

04:08.190 --> 04:09.580
Really?

04:09.700 --> 04:14.820
'Cause I'm wondering how many more jawbones
norton has to break before ali is all washed up.

04:17.010 --> 04:18.579
care to back that up,ray?

04:18.610 --> 04:20.040
20 bucks.

04:20.130 --> 04:22.100
Make it 40.

04:22.110 --> 04:26.690
tyler... I saw frazier floor
ali at the garden in '71.

04:26.770 --> 04:29.210
A powder-puff had him seeing stars.

04:29.390 --> 04:32.160
But I'd be happy to take your money.

04:32.460 --> 04:36.600
In a head-to-head match,rocky
marciano would'venocked them all out.

04:36.710 --> 04:42.840
I saw him drop "jersey" joe walcott with
his suzy Q... to take the title in55.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.210
A thing of beauty.

04:45.270 --> 04:47.860
Hey,loot,got some guy tying
up the phone all mornin'.

04:47.890 --> 04:50.310
Says he wants to speak to the
man in charge of the detectives.

04:50.450 --> 04:52.290
- Who is it?
-Wouldn't say.

04:52.480 --> 04:53.530
Take a message,phyliss,would you?

04:53.590 --> 04:55.790
He's making threats.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.610
You mind?

04:59.770 --> 05:02.070
give it here.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.300
Lieutenant gene hunt
speaking.What do you want?

05:04.410 --> 05:10.310
this is an official statement to the imperialist
pigs from the foot soldiers of the weather uerground.

05:10.470 --> 05:11.910
Yeah,yeah,yeah.

05:11.910 --> 05:14.260
Well,this imperialist pig
is busy.Get to the point.

05:14.420 --> 05:19.960
We act on this date in response to continued
american tyranny and oppression at home and abroad.

05:20.110 --> 05:24.140
These bombings are a strike to the
heart of the U.S.Gestapo organization.

05:24.290 --> 05:25.500
What?

05:25.520 --> 05:28.310
What d you just say?What bombings?

05:29.190 --> 05:31.400
A hell of a blast.

05:31.580 --> 05:33.570
took out windows up and down the block.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.210
Glenister'S.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.610
They blew up glenister'S.Are
you kidding me?

05:36.730 --> 05:38.740
what's glenister's?A bar?

05:38.890 --> 05:40.180
It's more like a national monument.

05:40.320 --> 05:42.660
61 years pouring booze into cops.

05:42.900 --> 05:47.520
Served up a mean steak and eggs,too,with
a vodka chaser and a beer chaser-chaser.

05:50.320 --> 05:52.500
for the love of god.

05:52.540 --> 05:55.800
four males,one female.At
least two were employees.

05:55.870 --> 05:58.080
Chris,get a canvass
started.Find some witnesses.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.270
let's go.Over here.

06:05.780 --> 06:08.580
Okay,guys,I need you to move
back.There's nothing to see.

06:08.720 --> 06:12.120
- The hell there ain'T.
- Just get behind the barricade,okay?Thank you.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.090
Who could've done this?

06:14.110 --> 06:15.970
That phone call.

06:16.030 --> 06:17.830
The weathermen claimed responsibility.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.230
I'm guessing you don't mean the
guys who say it's gonna rain.

06:20.270 --> 06:25.680
The weather underground-- student
radicals,terrorists,good-for-nothing,

06:26.020 --> 06:30.600
taking-for-granted,spoiled
know-it-alls... with bombs.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.540
This is bad,boss.

06:32.730 --> 06:38.260
Three of them were ours-- james
bolan,mike sadowski... clark krasner.

06:44.460 --> 06:51.480
Boles... kraz... ski.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.960
- He knew them.
- Yeah.

07:03.390 --> 07:05.630
you got an official cause
and origin yet,chief?

07:05.780 --> 07:08.770
The detonation point
was inside by the bar.

07:09.090 --> 07:13.350
The burn patterns suggest a flammable
liquid like kerosene was also used.

07:13.490 --> 07:15.650
Which is why it took
out the whole building.

07:15.650 --> 07:17.480
Very good,detective.

07:17.550 --> 07:19.700
We bagged some pieces.

07:19.780 --> 07:21.920
It looks like it's from an alarm clock.

07:22.020 --> 07:23.860
That is old-school.

07:23.950 --> 07:26.140
Even al qaeda's known
to use electronic timers.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.540
- Al who?
- Never mind.

07:35.810 --> 07:37.830
You all right?

07:39.260 --> 07:44.310
BoleS... ski... Kraz.

07:46.380 --> 07:48.780
They good friends of yours?

07:49.150 --> 07:52.740
We were gonna watch the fight together.

07:55.120 --> 07:57.610
I'm sorry.

07:57.610 --> 08:05.550
We drank these special drinks that,when made
correctly,had smoke rise out of the glass.

08:06.810 --> 08:08.230
Kraz invented 'em.

08:08.340 --> 08:11.330
Called them "burning questions.

08:11.420 --> 08:13.780
" The wires went quiet on these mooks.

08:13.940 --> 08:15.840
Bugged out of their last safe house.

08:15.960 --> 08:22.040
That's why they're called weather
underground-- hit the campuses,the coffeehouses

08:22.220 --> 08:28.170
shake down anyone with a button on their
blouse or a bumper sticker on their banjo.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.610
You said the caller
mentioned bombs... plural?

08:34.630 --> 08:37.220
We gotta find these guys
before they hit again.

08:37.289 --> 08:41.010
If there's a reason why glenister's was targeted,it
might tell us where they're gonna hit next.

08:41.010 --> 08:43.650
It seems pretty straightforward to me.

08:43.789 --> 08:46.490
They're targeting cops.

08:51.080 --> 08:51.900
Burn the mother down!

08:51.970 --> 08:53.710
We've got  to bring the war home!

08:53.850 --> 08:56.850
We've got to destroy  white privilege!

08:57.010 --> 09:01.210
We've got to break down  the barriers
of class...  start a free society!

09:01.340 --> 09:03.450
You feeling me,sam?

09:03.490 --> 09:05.600
Sam,why are they doing this?

09:05.770 --> 09:07.820
Whare they  blowing up the fuzz,man?

09:08.190 --> 09:10.150
Can't you help us,sam?

09:10.260 --> 09:11.760
you gotta save the pigs.

09:11.780 --> 09:14.200
You've gotta save the big pig.

09:14.360 --> 09:17.600
You think it's gonna be  a
long,long time,rocket man?

09:18.440 --> 09:21.160
My name is sam tyler.

09:21.310 --> 09:24.710
I was in an accident,and
I woke up in 1973.

09:24.710 --> 09:30.210
I don't know how or why  I'm here,but whatever's
happened,it's like I've landed  on a different planet.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.670
Now maybe if I can work out
 the reas,I can get home.

09:59.430 --> 10:03.580
as far as we could tell,glenister's
was targeted because it was a cop bar.

10:03.980 --> 10:07.980
Your dad and them was... just
in the wrong place,wrong time.

10:08.140 --> 10:10.760
Except they were in that
wrong place all the time.

10:11.080 --> 10:13.270
Must run in the family,huh?

10:15.060 --> 10:19.170
The,uh,army engineers told me the
mines in that paddy were cleared.

10:22.930 --> 10:24.030
You didn't see them much no more?

10:24.100 --> 10:25.920
No,they were retired.I'm
still on the job.

10:25.920 --> 10:29.400
Our schedules... but we
was gonna watch the fight.

10:29.540 --> 10:32.620
Yeah?And get pasted on those
ridiculous drinks on fire?

10:35.110 --> 10:37.590
"burning questions.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.570
" you remember?

10:48.140 --> 10:51.240
Your father loved you very much,danny.

10:51.720 --> 10:54.310
He told me many times
how proud of you he was.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.830
Yeah.

10:55.950 --> 10:58.320
He never mentioned it to me.

10:58.480 --> 11:01.780
But me and pop didn't have much
to say to each other these days.

11:03.380 --> 11:07.810
He was proud of me when I ran that kickoff
back 98 yards to win state in '6 remember that?

11:07.840 --> 11:09.700
I sure do.

11:09.780 --> 11:11.550
We all went out for lobster after.

11:11.740 --> 11:13.330
He was proud of me when I enlisted,too.

11:13.500 --> 11:16.090
Sure was.

11:18.060 --> 11:20.080
Do you know what?

11:20.190 --> 11:22.760
That pride was gone when
I came back in this chair.

11:23.620 --> 11:26.290
- Danny...
- no,it was.It was.

11:26.450 --> 11:30.020
That's why he kept on working
on cases even after he retired.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.110
Couldn't stand to be in the
same room as his busted-up son.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.930
Things are supposed to be done,you
got a cripple in your house.

11:37.050 --> 11:42.810
Light switches lowered,ramps put in... 14 months I'm
home,and I'm still carrying around this flashlight.

11:44.540 --> 11:48.440
God forbid I'd come home,and
it's night and the lights are off.

11:54.220 --> 11:57.250
- I'm sorry.
- ,Don't be.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.490
I hear that line so much,it
doesn't even mean anything anymore.

12:08.880 --> 12:14.910
surveillance reports,photos,suspect
files-- this all came from krasner's home?

12:15.030 --> 12:16.130
I thought he was retired.

12:16.150 --> 12:18.780
The weather underground were
sort of an obsession of his.

12:18.900 --> 12:20.860
Kind of ironic that he was
killed by them,don't you think?

12:20.920 --> 12:22.930
Not necessarily.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.580
He had many obsessions.

12:27.490 --> 12:29.110
Who is this guy?

12:29.120 --> 12:30.880
His name is rodney slaven.

12:31.030 --> 12:33.520
I saw footage of him
leading a demonstration.

12:34.150 --> 12:37.090
Look at his eyes.They're
different colors.

12:38.230 --> 12:39.580
Pretty cool.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.600
Like david bowie.

12:41.910 --> 12:43.350
Maybe we should look into him.

12:43.490 --> 12:45.050
I'll call B.O.S.S.I.,See
what they can dig up.

12:45.170 --> 12:49.280
- They might have something on him.
- Great.

12:49.580 --> 12:52.340
this is like one big
cardboard hard drive.

12:57.390 --> 12:59.200
Got somethin' here,boss.

12:59.370 --> 13:03.180
Professor pat olsen teaches a
poli-sci course at columbia univerty.

13:03.180 --> 13:08.240
The name of the course-- "the role of the radical
subversive in the enlightenment of our epoch.

13:08.290 --> 13:09.790
" Sounds angry.

13:09.970 --> 13:12.730
Here's a list of his "a" students.

13:13.200 --> 13:17.910
No coincidence that they're also
active members of the weathermen.

13:19.930 --> 13:22.060
This goes back to '68.

13:22.930 --> 13:24.130
You know what they say.

13:24.270 --> 13:29.840
"Those who can't do,teach.Those who can't
teach... inspire extreme revolutionary fervor.

13:30.030 --> 13:31.650
" Bring this guy in.

13:31.660 --> 13:34.240
He and I need to have a talk.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.560
We're looking for professor pat olsen.

13:50.700 --> 13:52.460
You can't just barge in here,man.

13:53.520 --> 13:54.910
not too bright,are you,professor?

13:55.080 --> 13:56.230
Let him go.

13:56.380 --> 13:59.120
Mind your own business,sugar
mouth,then you won't be minding mine.

13:59.250 --> 14:00.810
Except this is my business.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.180
Not where I come from,it ain'T.

14:02.330 --> 14:06.740
Well,tell me,where you come from,is
"pat" sometimes short for "patricia"?

14:16.520 --> 14:18.290
See if you can get
that cleaned up,petey.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.430
And leave the keys under the visor.

14:23.650 --> 14:25.410
The professor's a twirl?

14:25.910 --> 14:27.410
Looky,looky.

14:27.490 --> 14:28.760
I know you.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.160
You're gene hunt.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.330
Because every autocracy needs a tyrant.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.480
I am not a tyrant.

14:34.560 --> 14:37.340
I am a dictator.Big difference.

14:37.390 --> 14:41.130
Do I get to call a lawyer,or is it
straight to the jackboots and the truncheon?

14:41.200 --> 14:43.830
Stick the professor in lost and found.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.370
Who did that to your car,boss?

14:48.580 --> 14:51.080
Kids!Kids did this.

14:51.320 --> 14:52.750
It's what higher learning does.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.920
They major in stupid
with a minor in idiot.

15:05.570 --> 15:07.530
You want a soda while
we talk,professor olsen?

15:07.560 --> 15:09.400
Don't call me professor.

15:09.510 --> 15:11.680
We're clearly not in my classroom.

15:11.750 --> 15:13.280
Okay.

15:13.290 --> 15:15.040
Patricia then.

15:15.190 --> 15:18.610
Pat. Patty.Trish.
Tricia.Which do you prefer?

15:18.680 --> 15:21.470
You do know you've kidnapped
me without cause or warrant.

15:21.550 --> 15:23.520
- You don't know why you're in here?
- No.

15:23.700 --> 15:27.910
Don't shine us
on,pat-patty-trish-tricia.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.810
Don't do that.

15:31.210 --> 15:33.370
Es it really matter what I do or say?

15:33.440 --> 15:35.770
You'll beat a confession out
of me if you have to,won't you?

15:35.840 --> 15:36.980
I will.

15:37.020 --> 15:40.500
It's what we call in this
line of work "the perks.

15:41.800 --> 15:45.140
" okay.A bar called glenister's
was bombed this morning.

15:45.220 --> 15:47.340
I heard.What does it have to do with me?

15:47.520 --> 15:48.990
Five people were killed.

15:49.140 --> 15:51.440
That interest you at all?

15:51.510 --> 15:54.870
Three of them cops--
men I knew.Good men.

15:54.970 --> 15:56.440
I'm sorry to hear that.

15:56.480 --> 16:00.210
I am... if they were,as
you say,good men.

16:00.270 --> 16:02.890
However,I remain dubious.

16:02.930 --> 16:04.990
Dubious?Dubious about what?

16:05.120 --> 16:09.550
That in this day and age there are such
a thing... as cops who are good men.

16:10.290 --> 16:13.090
Maybe I will have that soda now.

16:13.710 --> 16:17.050
Let me tell you about my
good buddy clark who died.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.990
I stood with him when he
married his bride millie.

16:19.990 --> 16:23.410
I stood with him 30 years
later when he buried her.

16:23.720 --> 16:26.960
We toasted the birth
of his son together.

16:27.110 --> 16:29.350
He was eight months retired.

16:29.490 --> 16:35.060
That's terribly sad,but I'm sure adolf eichmann and
josef goebbels had similar stories of friendship and loss.

16:40.620 --> 16:42.780
The weathermen are behind the bombing.

16:42.890 --> 16:44.670
Disciples of yours,I understand.

16:44.710 --> 16:47.360
Some of them were former
students,that's all.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.080
I don't know anything about a
bombing.I want to talk to my husband.

16:50.130 --> 16:53.340
The weather underground is
planning another bombing today.

16:54.540 --> 16:58.530
You hear anything about that
from your former students?

16:58.650 --> 17:04.589
If you're mixed up in this,we will build a
case against you,professor olsen.That I promise.

17:04.650 --> 17:07.670
This happened to one of my
students-- a champion tennis player.

17:07.690 --> 17:11.630
Now he'll never play again because cops like you
broke his arm to railroad him for an armed robbery.

17:11.680 --> 17:12.680
I know how you work.

17:12.760 --> 17:15.310
You've already made up
your mind about my guilt.

17:15.760 --> 17:20.589
Out of curiosity,are you
right-handed or left-handed?

17:23.079 --> 17:24.359
Tricia!

17:24.420 --> 17:25.800
Where's my wife?I
wanna speak to my wife.

17:25.930 --> 17:27.250
Hey,pal,you can't just barge in here.

17:27.410 --> 17:29.520
- I wanna speak to my wife right now!
- Who's your wife?

17:29.580 --> 17:31.200
Professor patricia olsen.

17:31.270 --> 17:33.950
Goons from this precinct kidnapped
her right out of her classroom.

17:34.060 --> 17:35.880
- Mr. Olsen--
dr. Olsen.

17:35.910 --> 17:37.350
Dr. Richard olsen.

17:37.400 --> 17:41.690
Dr. Olsen,your wife is being questioned at
the moment regarding an ongoing investigation.

17:41.800 --> 17:46.080
Now if you and your ughter will just have a
seat,I'll let the detectives know you're here.

17:51.510 --> 17:52.770
What's your name?

17:52.840 --> 17:55.750
- Laura.
- Laura,would you like a chocolate bar?

17:55.890 --> 17:57.980
I think there's one left
in the vending machine.

17:58.150 --> 17:59.670
Yes,please.

17:59.700 --> 18:02.050
Okay.Well,at some point,we're gonna
run out of time on this situation.

18:02.160 --> 18:06.410
And at that point,the loot will beat the
truth out of the professor if he has to.

18:07.180 --> 18:09.830
- I'm talking about the boxing match,ray.
- Yeah.

18:10.070 --> 18:12.120
skelton,you have a call.

18:12.230 --> 18:13.910
detective
skelton.1-2-5.

18:13.990 --> 18:16.400
What did you just say?What did you say?

18:16.520 --> 18:18.010
Do I know you,chucklehead?

18:18.100 --> 18:20.990
Where isy wife,professor patricia olsen?

18:21.410 --> 18:23.300
Oh,the professor.

18:23.340 --> 18:26.250
Well,in case you didn't know
it,pal,your wife is a terrorist.

18:26.460 --> 18:29.130
Now sit down before I lock you up,too.

18:29.780 --> 18:31.140
Okay.come on,pal.Let's get you a seat.

18:31.270 --> 18:32.930
You know what?Take your hands off me.

18:32.970 --> 18:35.190
Ray,I just got a call
from communications.

18:35.320 --> 18:39.710
There's another situation--
another bomb situation.

18:39.950 --> 18:41.380
Let's go.

18:41.850 --> 18:44.330
Step back.

18:44.740 --> 18:46.250
what is that?

18:46.270 --> 18:47.500
that's the bomb squad,tyleR.

18:47.620 --> 18:48.950
That's your bomb squad?

18:48.990 --> 18:50.770
What,you didn't have
bomb squads at hyde?

18:50.770 --> 18:53.160
We did,but they weren't basket weavers.

18:53.220 --> 18:55.420
boss,you might not wanna go
back there.It's still live.

18:55.770 --> 18:57.620
boss.

18:57.890 --> 18:59.800
What's he doing?

19:00.210 --> 19:02.300
That's his guy.

19:02.500 --> 19:03.770
Roons!

19:03.840 --> 19:04.570
Hunt!

19:04.650 --> 19:07.280
Thank the lord in heaven it's you.

19:07.430 --> 19:10.050
God help me,pal,I'm
so scared,I can't me.

19:10.090 --> 19:12.760
My arm is numb,my ass is asleep.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.640
I peed myself.

19:14.690 --> 19:17.250
How long you been sittin' here,rooney?

19:17.360 --> 19:19.130
all damn day.

19:19.260 --> 19:20.760
I heard about the glen.

19:20.840 --> 19:24.780
So I'm heading to the scene,but I turn
this key halfway and I-I hear this--

19:24.810 --> 19:29.430
this click under my seat like I
never heard before-- loud click.

19:30.500 --> 19:33.950
Hunt,don't leave me here.Don't leave me.

19:34.150 --> 19:35.760
I'm not going anywhere.

19:36.770 --> 19:38.520
Yeah.

19:41.870 --> 19:44.750
The lieutenant can't be here.

19:47.740 --> 19:50.630
What happened to them...
to boles and ski and kraz?

19:50.680 --> 19:51.680
Did they get hurt?

19:51.740 --> 19:54.450
Let's get you out of
this,then we'll talk.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.450
Aw,man.

19:56.550 --> 19:58.800
Who,gene?Which one of the guys?

19:59.610 --> 20:01.830
It's me and you now,roonS.

20:06.710 --> 20:09.210
why are they coming after us?

20:10.680 --> 20:13.250
I need you guys to stand back here.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.200
- Come on,gene.
- I'm not goin' anywhere.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.780
Don't--  boss...
don't leave me.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.970
Stayin' with my guy.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.400
stayin' with the roons.

20:20.470 --> 20:22.320
please,lieutenant.

20:22.370 --> 20:24.500
Please,stand back.

20:26.330 --> 20:27.840
Lieutenant,you gotta step back.

20:27.870 --> 20:29.730
No,sir! No,sir!

20:29.780 --> 20:33.840
Hey,ray... the guy with the
ponytail--I saw him outside glenister'S.

20:33.990 --> 20:35.390
- Are you re?
- Absolutely.

20:35.610 --> 20:37.420
- Stayin' with my guy.
- Get him outta here!

20:37.540 --> 20:38.900
That's my gene.

20:38.950 --> 20:41.150
No! No! Gene! Just stay easy.

20:41.290 --> 20:44.150
Go easy,detective.Try to stay calm.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.760
Do your job,son.Do
your job--

20:53.800 --> 20:55.670
roons!

21:01.780 --> 21:03.760
he said they were coming after you.

21:03.920 --> 21:05.710
Who's coming after you,gene?

21:05.780 --> 21:08.140
Who's coming after you?

21:24.170 --> 21:26.400
rodney slaven-- he's
like a rock star.

21:26.460 --> 21:27.350
Yeah.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.110
Look at those eyes.

21:29.270 --> 21:31.260
we gotta get back out there.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.060
They're not finished.

21:33.210 --> 21:36.920
Sam,should I be calling my family and
friends,telling them to get out of the city?

21:37.090 --> 21:39.850
- If you let these people
scare you-- I know,I know.

21:40.000 --> 21:40.960
The terrorists win.

21:41.060 --> 21:43.310
I was gonna say they'll always have
the advantage,but that's catchy.

21:43.480 --> 21:46.410
Thankswell,he's one you
don't have to worry about.

21:46.490 --> 21:48.130
Rodney slaven died a year ago.

21:48.300 --> 21:50.130
He O.D.'D.

21:50.760 --> 21:53.460
- He's dead?
- He iS.

21:53.870 --> 21:55.630
Yeah.

21:56.330 --> 21:58.560
Um,look,check this out.

21:58.690 --> 22:00.330
There's the professor in the crowd.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.720
She's one of them--
the weathermen.

22:04.060 --> 22:10.010
And... this is the guy chris saw
at both bombings-- eric larson.

22:10.210 --> 22:12.330
We need to send out an alarm.

22:12.480 --> 22:18.710
It can be just a coincidence that four of hunt's friends on
the job were all on the receiving end of weathermen bombs today.

22:19.570 --> 22:21.260
Hunt knows a l of cops.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.710
Yeah,but this wasn't random.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.320
I mean,they were all targets.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.340
There's gonna be another bomb.

22:29.750 --> 22:34.400
Arthur rooney helped to protect the city
for over 40 years,and you blew him up!

22:35.190 --> 22:37.500
you... Blew... him... up!

22:37.630 --> 22:39.700
You... Blew... him... up!

22:39.810 --> 22:42.140
Stop!

22:43.800 --> 22:47.260
If this woman doesn't tell me who's
responsible for killing those men,

22:47.330 --> 22:52.570
I'm gonna punch her so hard,down on canal
street,they'll be stepping over her smirk.

22:52.770 --> 22:54.040
I understand.

22:54.130 --> 22:56.140
Come here.

22:57.900 --> 22:59.650
look at these.

22:59.920 --> 23:03.940
We got eyewitnesses placing this man,eric
larson,at the scene of both bombings.

23:04.080 --> 23:06.810
We got wire
transcripts,manifestos,fake I.D.S.

23:06.860 --> 23:10.740
,You name it,all proving your
connection to the weather underground.

23:11.280 --> 23:13.670
Conspiracy to commit murder.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.470
That's major time
upstate,professor olsen.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.700
And cop killings?

23:18.820 --> 23:20.420
that adds to the jolt.

23:20.570 --> 23:21.260
Where did you get these?

23:21.320 --> 23:24.960
You give us the names of the other targets,and
you'll be looking at a lot less jail time.

23:24.960 --> 23:27.970
You might even be out in time to
see your daughter off to college.

23:29.850 --> 23:32.120
My daughter is the
reason I do what I do.

23:32.160 --> 23:36.010
I don't want her growing up in a world where
imperialist pigs waow in their own excrement.

23:36.130 --> 23:39.970
All the children in the city
are the reason I do what I do!

23:43.140 --> 23:46.860
Look,trust me when I say this,you
won't be remembered as heroes.

23:46.860 --> 23:52.110
You'll be seen as spoiled
thugs,hoodlums... terrorists.

23:52.210 --> 23:54.220
It's terrorism when i
stand up for my rights?

23:54.270 --> 23:56.580
Tell me,why is it that
government-sanctioned violence is tolerated?

23:56.620 --> 24:01.270
America slaughtered a million vietnamese civilians
without even blinking,and I'm the criminal?

24:01.330 --> 24:04.020
The people you killed
today were innocent.

24:04.100 --> 24:06.970
Anyone who isn't part of the
revolution can't be considered innocent.

24:07.060 --> 24:11.090
The people you killed
stood up for this city.

24:11.140 --> 24:17.260
Other than being imperialist pigs,what possible
reason could you have had to take their lives?

24:17.470 --> 24:20.400
They were part of something they
shouldn't have been a part of.

24:20.530 --> 24:22.780
What--what are
you talking about?

24:23.390 --> 24:26.580
He knows what I'm talking about.

24:28.710 --> 24:31.040
He ran the group.

24:31.980 --> 24:34.610
The red squad.

24:35.820 --> 24:36.980
get out.

24:37.070 --> 24:38.130
Boss?Boss,what's she talking about?

24:38.170 --> 24:40.680
Me a the professor
need to chat some more.

24:42.650 --> 24:44.640
Get out.

24:45.110 --> 24:48.420
I promise I won't kill her... yet.

25:03.090 --> 25:04.730
ray,I've been looking for you.

25:04.780 --> 25:08.510
Yeah,I'm working on finding a current
address for larson,but so far,no dice.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.640
Better hope hunt can
get that loon to sing.

25:10.670 --> 25:13.140
Otherwise,we're gonna have bigger
problems than where to watch the fight.

25:13.150 --> 25:14.370
Well,hunt just kicked me out.

25:14.390 --> 25:17.050
Who knows what the hell kind of medieval
thumb screws he's using on the professor.

25:17.150 --> 25:18.680
Kicked you out?

25:18.720 --> 25:20.540
What'd you do,spaceman,take her side?

25:20.650 --> 25:22.630
Ray,listen.

25:22.690 --> 25:27.220
You ever hear about the loot running
some group called,uh... the red squad?

25:27.380 --> 25:28.600
Red squad?

25:28.780 --> 25:30.310
- Yeah.
- Yeah,I heard rumors.

25:30.550 --> 25:32.720
Nothin' involving the loot.

25:32.760 --> 25:37.000
Supposedly they were a group of lawmen that ran
under-the-radar surveillance on radical groups.

25:37.060 --> 25:38.700
Supposedly?

25:38.830 --> 25:42.390
Bit of a myth,like,uh,the
tooth fairy or mermaids.

25:42.540 --> 25:46.280
It never really existed-- just a
ploy to keep the hippies paranoid.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.950
Let the loot have his
time.He ain't gonna hurt her.

25:49.990 --> 25:52.380
He's just gonna have her 
think he's gonna hurt her.

25:52.450 --> 25:55.970
He's been running interrogations
since the night samson met delilah.

26:00.150 --> 26:01.040
sam?

26:01.130 --> 26:02.120
Yeah?

26:02.300 --> 26:05.580
I was doing my due diligence-- following
up on the rodney slaven autopsy report.

26:05.670 --> 26:07.170
I thought slaven died
of a drug overdose.

26:07.220 --> 26:09.430
He did,but it wasn't heroin.

26:09.590 --> 26:12.800
According to the report,hydromorphone
was the drug that killed him.

26:12.940 --> 26:14.320
Pharmaceutical grade.

26:14.520 --> 26:16.200
Enough to put down an elephant.

26:16.300 --> 26:19.170
Hydromorphone.That's not
really a street drug,is it?

26:19.180 --> 26:21.070
- I thought it was odd.And another thing...
- what?

26:21.210 --> 26:22.850
Look at the date of death on the report.

26:22.870 --> 26:24.970
He died exactly one year ago today.

26:25.050 --> 26:27.320
He died or he was killed.

26:27.660 --> 26:31.290
So on the anniversary of his
death,four cops get blown up.

26:31.340 --> 26:34.100
Like I said,I thought it was odd.

26:36.640 --> 26:38.070
**********

26:38.130 --> 26:40.490
I've had your names ever since the
weathermen infiltrated your offices.

26:40.620 --> 26:43.170
You terrorized them,dangled them
by their ankles outside of windows,

26:43.260 --> 26:46.450
threw tear gas grenades into their
homes,and when that didn't work,

26:46.690 --> 26:50.130
let's just say nobody knows better
than me the lengths you'd go to.

26:51.940 --> 26:58.470
Look,professor... if the red squad did exist,I'm
sure their goal was to protect the public...

26:58.630 --> 27:03.390
from collegiate communists who were trying to
overthrow the government and burn the city down.

27:04.650 --> 27:05.540
- boss?
- What?

27:05.670 --> 27:07.290
I need to ask pat a few questions.

27:07.420 --> 27:09.340
Two minutes,that's it.

27:10.760 --> 27:13.300
five seconds over,and
your ass is outta here.

27:15.470 --> 27:19.820
I had no idea the whole "good cop,bad cop" thing
was more than just the stuff of old police dramas.

27:19.850 --> 27:22.210
How well did you know rodney slaven?

27:23.290 --> 27:24.920
We were friends.

27:25.030 --> 27:26.490
Was slaven a junkie?

27:26.630 --> 27:28.280
He never touched the
stuff his whole life.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.790
But he died of a drug
overdose,didn't he?

27:30.890 --> 27:33.920
Exactly one year ago today.

27:34.060 --> 27:37.170
He didn't die of an overdose.They
just wanted it to look that way.

27:37.180 --> 27:38.300
They?

27:38.320 --> 27:39.700
Who's they?

27:39.810 --> 27:45.320
You should know better than anyone,hunt.

27:47.690 --> 27:49.230
Ne,gene.Gene!

27:49.380 --> 27:52.770
Gene,gene... can we... for a moment?

27:55.510 --> 28:02.130
Listen,I can see a scenario where the red squad might've found it
necessary to get rid of one dangerous radical to protect the city.

28:02.190 --> 28:05.360
You think the red squad
murdered rodney slaven?

28:05.480 --> 28:10.640
I'm just saying I can see how it could've happened,based
on the surveillance coming out of these boxes.

28:10.720 --> 28:15.370
Tyler,they may have tuned him up,beat him
up,framed him up or called him dirty names.

28:15.540 --> 28:19.650
But no way in hell my cops shot
him up with junk to kill him.

28:19.740 --> 28:21.970
Maybe rooney,krasner and the
rest did it without you knowing.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.960
Nobody does anything without me knowing.

28:23.970 --> 28:29.940
Either way,she thinks you were a member of the red
squad,which means we already know the target of the next bomb.

28:30.880 --> 28:33.600
It's you.

28:42.490 --> 28:44.190
yeah?

28:56.750 --> 29:01.640
I was thinking... maybe you should get
out of town,go somewhere sunny,you know?

29:02.080 --> 29:03.270
Till we find larson.

29:03.350 --> 29:06.120
My ex-wife's been trying
to kill me for 20 years.

29:06.240 --> 29:09.380
So to hell with the
professor and her weathermen.

29:09.860 --> 29:13.160
There have been spiders crawling
up my wall I've been more afraid of.

29:15.750 --> 29:16.790
What are you hovering for?

29:16.830 --> 29:20.400
Don't you got an
investigation to conduct?

29:24.580 --> 29:26.420
gene,give me a straig answer.

29:26.420 --> 29:28.860
Who were the red squad?

29:37.560 --> 29:39.790
The last of the hard men.

29:40.570 --> 29:43.030
A dying breed.

29:46.130 --> 29:48.330
But they weren't murderers.

29:49.560 --> 29:51.740
That I know.

30:02.940 --> 30:05.740
our coffee is the worst
form of torture we've got.

30:12.210 --> 30:14.150
Yomust miss him a lot.

30:14.230 --> 30:16.710
- Who?
-Rodney slaven.

30:17.880 --> 30:19.130
Why do you say that?

30:19.280 --> 30:23.460
He was a friend of yours,wasn't he?

30:23.480 --> 30:25.040
He was.

30:25.100 --> 30:27.670
How long did you know him?

30:28.090 --> 30:30.520
Is this another form of interrogation?

30:30.720 --> 30:33.050
Not at all.

30:33.070 --> 30:35.880
It's just two women talking.

30:42.060 --> 30:44.670
I met him when he was 18.

30:46.070 --> 30:51.550
He... arrived on campus ready to
set the world ablaze with his ideas.

30:52.420 --> 30:54.830
He inspired a lot of people.

30:54.980 --> 30:57.170
He did.

30:57.220 --> 31:00.040
He could've done important
things with his li.

31:01.860 --> 31:06.840
Rodney was... fond of quoting the
jazz musician charlie parker...

31:09.690 --> 31:11.370
who said,

31:11.530 --> 31:17.070
"you learn all the notes and the chords and the
scales "and you practice them and practice them "

31:17.790 --> 31:22.020
until you get them right,and then you
throw all that crap away and you just wail.

31:23.760 --> 31:28.210
" Rodney was just beginning to
wail when those men killed him.

31:33.290 --> 31:35.650
Your daughter and your
husband are out there.

31:35.650 --> 31:37.820
When can I see them?

31:38.820 --> 31:42.120
I'm gonna have to check
with the detectives.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.620
Sam?

31:45.790 --> 31:47.560
What?

31:47.590 --> 31:48.680
What is it?

31:48.810 --> 31:50.960
Pat olsen was in love
with rodney slaven.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.750
- How do you know that?
- Women know these things.

31:52.790 --> 31:54.020
She lod him.

31:54.170 --> 31:56.060
Well,she'll have plenty of time to
reflect on her broken heart in prison.

31:56.140 --> 31:57.940
No,no,no,sam,there's more.

31:58.030 --> 31:59.280
What?

31:59.440 --> 32:01.630
Dr.Olsen,this is detective tyler.

32:01.770 --> 32:03.500
Detective,dr.Richard olsen.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.000
Look,what--what's
happening?

32:05.070 --> 32:06.530
I just want to see my wife.

32:06.720 --> 32:08.900
Um,we're still questioning her,doctor.

32:09.030 --> 32:11.390
And,sam,have you met laura?

32:13.790 --> 32:16.210
You gotta save the pigs.

32:17.380 --> 32:18.410
Those eyes.

32:18.510 --> 32:21.050
Is my mother going to be okay?

32:28.570 --> 32:30.900
You wanna kill somebody
else today,professor?

32:31.000 --> 32:33.400
Is that gonna make your
daughter proud of you?

32:33.430 --> 32:35.340
You're a selfish woman,you hear me?

32:35.420 --> 32:37.780
You're a selfish piece of crap!

32:37.840 --> 32:41.030
And one of these days you're gonna wake up,and
your daughter's gonna be the real victim here--

32:41.130 --> 32:44.320
your daughter.Now
where is that last bomb?

32:45.030 --> 32:47.430
- tell me,professor!
- Gene,let go of her.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.270
where can we find eric larson?

32:51.400 --> 32:52.980
I would like very much
to see my daughter.

32:53.060 --> 32:54.640
Larson planted those bombs,didn't he?

32:54.670 --> 32:56.830
I won't betray the cause,detective.

32:56.950 --> 32:59.310
I don't regret anything I've done.

33:00.840 --> 33:02.680
I wanna kill this woman,sam.

33:02.970 --> 33:04.430
I do.

33:04.470 --> 33:08.110
I won't,because I could
never commit murder.

33:08.360 --> 33:11.870
But I want to... very badly.

33:12.860 --> 33:16.190
I want to kill this woman,sam.

33:20.580 --> 33:22.650
patricia.

33:22.750 --> 33:24.840
- Are you okay?Are you hurt?
- I'm fine,richard.

33:24.890 --> 33:25.790
Thank god you're here.

33:25.960 --> 33:30.760
They are maniacs.This one-- quite possibly
the worst person I have ever encountered.

33:31.390 --> 33:32.490
Where's laura?

33:32.790 --> 33:34.640
She--she's
outside.

33:34.990 --> 33:37.180
Take a seat,dr.Ols.

33:38.450 --> 33:39.880
why?What for?

33:39.880 --> 33:42.050
Just take a seat.

33:46.860 --> 33:49.030
it's okay.

33:55.540 --> 34:00.960
One year ago today,someone killed rodney slaven with
a hot shot of hydromorphone that stopped his heart.

34:01.370 --> 34:05.140
And contrary to what you might
believe,professor olsen...

34:06.620 --> 34:08.449
the red squad had nothing to do with it.

34:08.570 --> 34:11.860
Contrary to what you
believe,detective,rodney was not a junkie.

34:12.030 --> 34:14.239
But the hydromorphone
was pharmaceutical grade.

34:14.350 --> 34:17.159
Yes,the kind that well-connected
cops have easy access to.

34:17.159 --> 34:20.100
As do doctors... in hospitals.

34:20.239 --> 34:25.290
according to the investigation,there was no
sign of forced entry to slaven's apartment.

34:25.560 --> 34:28.120
Suggesting slaven knew
the man who killed him.

34:32.179 --> 34:35.090
You knew she was having an
affair with slaven,didn't you?

34:40.480 --> 34:42.520
Didn't you?

34:47.050 --> 34:48.820
I diD.

34:48.940 --> 34:51.070
richard.

34:51.090 --> 34:55.310
Why?I mean,I know you always thought he
was a genius,but does that make me stupid?

34:56.370 --> 34:59.290
What I didn't know is
how long it had gone on.

35:03.210 --> 35:09.130
I stayed away from slaven
and pat's radical friends,

35:09.200 --> 35:14.200
but... about a year or so ago,

35:14.680 --> 35:20.320
I... I ran into rodney...
at the greengrocer...

35:22.360 --> 35:24.190
and I saw his eyes.

35:27.860 --> 35:31.070
I saw his eyes,and I knew those eyes.

35:32.660 --> 35:35.740
I knew them... because they were...

35:37.010 --> 35:39.380
because they wereyour daughter's eyes.

35:48.890 --> 35:53.550
I loved her like my
own--  your bastard child.

35:54.460 --> 35:56.110
Richard.

35:56.530 --> 35:58.870
No.

35:59.030 --> 36:02.100
Four officers are dead
over a domestic squabble?

36:05.410 --> 36:09.290
I never realized that you'd go this
far,patricia,and not over politics,

36:09.510 --> 36:14.280
not over some cause,but for love?

36:15.320 --> 36:22.910
Who insisted--who insisted that you couldn't be
fully mine while in the middle of a revolution.

36:24.170 --> 36:26.360
You're a hypocrite.

36:26.460 --> 36:29.100
A phony.

36:32.620 --> 36:41.860
we've already said   good-bye

36:42.210 --> 36:43.910
Stop!

36:45.510 --> 36:48.880
since you gotta go 
 oh,you better go now

36:49.000 --> 37:02.100
go now   go now   see me cry

37:05.020 --> 37:09.600
I don't want you to tl me
just what you intend to do now

37:12.670 --> 37:16.540
'cause how many times I
have to tell you,darlin'?

37:16.610 --> 37:21.280
Darlin',I'm still in
love with you now   oh

37:24.020 --> 37:32.430
we've already said   so long

37:35.310 --> 37:37.450
I don't wanna see you go

37:37.510 --> 37:44.340
oh,you better go now   go now

37:44.860 --> 37:47.350
'cause how many times I
have to tell you,darlin'?

37:47.700 --> 37:54.700
Darlin',I'm still in
love,still in love with you now

37:58.640 --> 38:00.410
that poor little girl.

38:00.570 --> 38:02.630
This whole thing had
nothing to do with her.

38:02.760 --> 38:04.770
And everything to do with her.

38:05.080 --> 38:08.380
only thing I can tell you,as this crowd
starts getting  warmed up for this big fight...

38:08.460 --> 38:10.020
what are you guys doing here?

38:10.120 --> 38:12.200
'S it look like we're doing,tyler?

38:12.200 --> 38:18.010
The fight starts in 45 minutes,and thanks to
chris over here,these are our ringside seats.

38:18.210 --> 38:19.790
but I'm ordering pizza.

38:19.950 --> 38:21.610
Yeah,big deal.

38:21.730 --> 38:23.860
Um,so are you guys looking
for a place to watch the fight?

38:23.910 --> 38:26.140
Yeah.

38:26.280 --> 38:28.180
I know a place.

38:40.820 --> 38:42.390
thank god it's still the undercard!

38:42.440 --> 38:44.080
how did you know about
this place,spaceman?

38:44.210 --> 38:46.240
Well,you know,I live around the corner.

38:46.730 --> 38:48.470
I walk bit.I don't go in.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.040
Oh,you're a saint.

38:50.150 --> 38:52.640
There was a big sign that
said the fight was on,so...

38:54.890 --> 38:59.030
you know,uh,one day you're not gonna have
to come to a strip bar to watch a fight.

38:59.130 --> 39:01.580
Well,that's a day I hope I never see.

39:04.760 --> 39:09.500
hey,I'm feeling so confident about
norton,what do you say we triple the bet?

39:10.710 --> 39:12.610
You're on.

39:12.920 --> 39:15.140
I'm a sucker for the underdog.

39:20.360 --> 39:22.310
all right.

39:23.900 --> 39:25.710
Not bad,huh,danny?

39:25.790 --> 39:27.220
Great.

39:27.220 --> 39:28.910
I'm sorry about your dad.

39:28.910 --> 39:31.130
- I'm glad you could make it,gene.
- thank you.

39:31.250 --> 39:32.960
- I'm glad you brought your friend.
- Appreciate it.

39:32.980 --> 39:36.760
- Sorry to hear about your dad.
- Thanks a lot.

39:37.630 --> 39:39.920
No problem thank you.

39:40.580 --> 39:41.690
And what have we here?

39:41.840 --> 39:43.880
Two "burning questions" for you guys.

39:43.980 --> 39:45.990
Made to order.

40:10.350 --> 40:12.020
run back there,honey,

40:12.170 --> 40:15.490
and have them make one
more for my friend here.

40:31.120 --> 40:36.890
I think you know,sam,that when things we care about go
away,it can be easy to forget our place in the journey.

40:39.270 --> 40:45.210
That's why I think I'm ready
to start living... here,in 1973.

40:45.690 --> 40:48.290
How did you come to that conclusion?

41:02.400 --> 41:06.850
because there are some things here that make
breaking down those walls absolutely worthwhile.

41:11.260 --> 41:17.040
because I think I have to begin
to make peace with the now.

41:18.740 --> 41:21.090
but I have to tell you,doctor,that...

41:21.860 --> 41:24.700
as long as I'm here...

41:27.660 --> 41:30.530
I can never,ever stop
trying to find my way home.
