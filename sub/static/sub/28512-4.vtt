when I sought you out after dark,

03:20.485 --> 03:23.085
my sole intention was to trick you.

into the politics of Virginia

I'd like concealed.

17:22.885 --> 17:25.845
Might you have such as
a chest with a lock on it?

17:26.964 --> 17:28.645
Or...

17:28.725 --> 17:31.765
I don't want anything
that might catch a robber's eye.

17:32.565 --> 17:34.405
How might you advise me?

17:34.485 --> 17:36.445
Let me confide in you, sir.

17:37.405 --> 17:40.325
My husband has some pieces of gold
he obtained from the...

17:40.405 --> 17:44.205
Madam, a wise-fingered forager
will never be stopped by locks.

17:44.285 --> 17:48.325
The trick is concealment.
Thieves have a born instinct,

17:48.405 --> 17:50.765
so your treasures
must be hidden with wit.

17:52.365 --> 17:54.485
Governor! Sir...

17:55.845 --> 17:58.925
I have here
the most majestic Turkey-work chair.

17:59.005 --> 18:02.325
Might you consider it? I wonder
it wouldn't suit you well.

18:14.405 --> 18:17.005
So you will stay?
Will you sit?

18:17.085 --> 18:19.125
I imagine
you will appear most kingly.

18:24.965 --> 18:27.125
Ah!

18:27.205 --> 18:30.205
Your chair is worth
a whistling, sir, certainly,

18:30.285 --> 18:35.005
but it is a barren fellow
who feeds on objects and fashion,

18:35.085 --> 18:38.325
when he might glory
in prizes more fantastical.

18:39.845 --> 18:41.845
I was wounded at war, sir.

18:41.925 --> 18:44.165
Your wounds are at the womb.

the difference between us.

what have you found?

19:15.645 --> 19:18.645
If the beast is Spanish,

19:18.725 --> 19:22.045
then it would have travelled
many miles and many days,

19:22.125 --> 19:25.445
and it would have encountered
plenty of men.

19:27.245 --> 19:29.405
Then why has it not been captured?

19:29.485 --> 19:31.845
James Read, we do not want
to discover the horse.

It's one thing to catch sight
of the great horse,

19:42.805 --> 19:44.525
but another thing to catch it.

19:52.965 --> 19:55.485
The Governor believes
I saw the beast by magic.

20:00.285 --> 20:03.005

to be caught.

My dear, we are to pass your image
on once more to future years.

36:11.725 --> 36:13.725
It is true.

36:13.805 --> 36:15.765
My body is rich with your child.

36:18.405 --> 36:21.085
I pray it is a boy,
lives in your like.

36:24.565 --> 36:27.525
Governor, I have the horse.

36:27.605 --> 36:29.525
You?

36:29.605 --> 36:32.805
You're certain that I might ride the
creature into town for all to see?

36:32.885 --> 36:35.205
There is a cost.

36:35.285 --> 36:37.005
A political payment.

36:37.085 --> 36:39.725
A pardon for Silas Sharrow.

36:41.125 --> 36:42.805
Will you pay it?

36:44.725 --> 36:47.285
If you choose to give the horse
to Yeardley

36:47.365 --> 36:50.565
and tell him that
it was you who found it...

36:52.005 --> 36:54.925
..he will believe anything
you tell him after that.

36:55.005 --> 36:57.125
Anything.

36:57.205 --> 36:59.165
Is that what you want, Maria?

37:00.805 --> 37:02.725
You can trick him.

37:02.805 --> 37:07.525
Make his mind diseased
with what you tell him.

37:09.165 --> 37:11.165
Is that what you want?

37:15.965 --> 37:17.965
The decision's yours, Maria.

37:23.525 --> 37:25.605
You said it yourself, Henry.

37:25.685 --> 37:27.965
The man who possesses the horse
owns him.

37:29.765 --> 37:33.325
Silas can return to the farm, if
we give the horse to the Governor.

37:34.365 --> 37:37.245
My own brother will live
and be hunted no more.

37:37.765 --> 37:40.925
Well, he ain't mine
to give you, Henry.

37:41.005 --> 37:42.965
Belongs to Maria.

37:46.285 --> 37:51.045
Maria, this is the man
that hunted us down.

37:52.045 --> 37:55.205
This is the man
that put us into chains

37:55.285 --> 37:57.245
and gave us to the Governor

37:57.325 --> 37:59.845
that he might put
that brand upon your cheek.

38:37.405 --> 38:41.685
You find your Governor
precious with generosity.

38:43.005 --> 38:47.165
My wife bears within her
the celebration of our prayers.

38:48.445 --> 38:50.605
A babe!

38:50.685 --> 38:52.645
The love of years.

38:52.725 --> 38:54.685
(CHEERING)

38:59.525 --> 39:02.245
Silas Sharrow...

39:02.325 --> 39:05.485
you might enjoy the mercy
and compassion of England...

39:07.405 --> 39:10.045
..should you here renounce
your heathen beliefs

39:10.125 --> 39:12.925
and declare yourself a servant

39:13.005 --> 39:16.125
of the one true almighty God.

39:21.005 --> 39:24.965
I stand here
ready to be baptised again, sir.

40:03.005 --> 40:04.605
Oh...

40:04.685 --> 40:07.885
Oh, you make the sun itself
look dim.

40:07.965 --> 40:11.925
The whole town sees that you were
right and they were wrong, sir.

40:14.005 --> 40:16.765
You think cos the horse stands here,
I'm a true man?

40:19.965 --> 40:22.405
All discoveries in drink are false.

40:23.485 --> 40:25.685
Your hopes disgust me, boy.
Meredith!

40:25.765 --> 40:27.885
Your need is sickeningly ugly.

40:27.965 --> 40:32.925
There's a monstrousness to you
that even a drunk cannot abide.

40:34.525 --> 40:36.525
Get gone from my sight.
Meredith.

40:36.605 --> 40:40.285
The rat had no ma and no pa,

40:40.365 --> 40:42.725
because you ain't worthy of none,

40:42.805 --> 40:44.445
and you never will be!

40:44.525 --> 40:46.485
(SOBS)

40:52.685 --> 40:54.485
My pa was a drunk like this.

40:54.565 --> 40:56.365
A fool.

40:56.445 --> 40:58.205
A madman.

40:58.285 --> 41:00.285
A drowned man.

41:00.365 --> 41:02.365
A coward.

41:02.445 --> 41:04.405
A king.

41:05.205 --> 41:07.805
And the cruellest tongue
of the devil itself.

41:09.325 --> 41:11.325
But he paid for it,

41:11.405 --> 41:13.205
and so will you, Meredith Rutter.

41:13.285 --> 41:15.045
I swear.

41:15.125 --> 41:19.085
I swear you will pay.

42:15.805 --> 42:18.445
(DISTANT CRIES)

42:18.525 --> 42:20.485
(MUFFLED SCREAMS)

42:29.245 --> 42:31.245
(SCREAMS REVERBERATE)

42:47.365 --> 42:49.365
Maria.

42:50.565 --> 42:53.565
Pedro...

42:53.645 --> 42:56.605
There is so much blood.

43:00.085 --> 43:02.645
It is coming, Pedro.

43:02.725 --> 43:06.285
I hear the cries of the dying, Pedro.

43:06.965 --> 43:08.805
It is a dream, Maria,

43:08.885 --> 43:10.725
no more than that.
There is no blood.

43:17.405 --> 43:18.885
You might know me again, James,

43:18.965 --> 43:20.565
if you promise not to love me.

43:20.645 --> 43:24.045
You drove that boy away when you
knew I loved him as my own child.

43:24.125 --> 43:25.685
If you did not hide behind your hump,

43:25.765 --> 43:27.925
I'd relish riding a sword
through your throat.

43:28.005 --> 43:29.965
I accept your challenge.

43:31.565 --> 43:33.725
You will be the one
who will pry Chacrow away

43:33.805 --> 43:35.485
from his loyalty to Opechancanough.

43:35.565 --> 43:39.325
Deliver him to us, or your brother's
land will be taken from them.

43:39.445 --> 43:41.365
You're not a factor,
nor a company agent.

43:41.445 --> 43:43.765
You are the most powerful man
in Virginia.

43:44.605 --> 43:46.845
My king says you must die, Silas.
