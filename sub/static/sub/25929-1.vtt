<i>It is but one life,</i>

01:41.775 --> 01:45.512
<i>whether we spend it
in loving or in weeping.</i>

01:51.184 --> 01:53.985
<i>High up the mountain,
where the coffee grows,</i>

01:53.987 --> 01:56.988
<i>is an island within an island.</i>

01:56.990 --> 02:00.090
<i>A place where many Japanese
came to work and live</i>

02:00.092 --> 02:02.696
<i>in pursuit of a new life.</i>

02:10.204 --> 02:12.971
<i>A young boy of mixed race
was left an orphan,</i>

02:12.973 --> 02:16.107
<i>when a foreign sickness
struck the island.</i>

02:16.109 --> 02:18.143
<i>To protect that boy,</i>

02:18.145 --> 02:20.478
<i>his unwed mother had hid him</i>

02:20.480 --> 02:23.982
<i>from the small community
of coffee pickers,</i>

02:23.984 --> 02:28.220
<i>who believed such children
brought shame and bad luck.</i>

02:28.222 --> 02:30.891
<i>No one knew
that the child existed.</i>

02:33.226 --> 02:36.127
<i>This terrible disease
did not discriminate</i>

02:36.129 --> 02:38.196
<i>between race and class.</i>

02:38.198 --> 02:40.998
<i>Mr. Danielson,
the plantation owner,</i>

02:41.000 --> 02:45.503
<i>was forever changed upon the
passing of his beloved wife.</i>

02:45.505 --> 02:47.172
<i>On that very sad day,</i>

02:47.174 --> 02:49.841
<i>I became the guardian
of Miss Grace.</i>

02:56.582 --> 03:00.150
<i>And so, two children
from very different worlds</i>

03:00.152 --> 03:03.690
<i>were both left
without their mothers.</i>

06:19.118 --> 06:21.285
Hey, kid!

06:21.287 --> 06:23.987
Hey, you shouldn't be
near that body.

06:23.989 --> 06:25.924
It's not safe. Hey!

08:07.894 --> 08:09.230
A very good morning.

08:25.846 --> 08:28.212
Excuse me! There's gotta be
a better alternative

08:28.214 --> 08:30.881
than beating the kid senseless.

08:30.883 --> 08:33.083
Here.

08:33.086 --> 08:36.453
This should cover you
for whatever the kid owes you.

08:36.456 --> 08:38.958
Now, let's have a look at you,
young man.

08:40.092 --> 08:42.092
Let me take a look at ya, kid.

08:45.932 --> 08:49.334
Hey, take it easy
with that stuff.

08:49.336 --> 08:50.571
It's fragile.

09:00.880 --> 09:03.547
Half?

09:03.549 --> 09:06.584
I sailed 2,500 miles
at my own expense,

09:06.586 --> 09:09.119
I bounced all the way up
this blasted mountain,

09:09.121 --> 09:11.422
and now you're telling me
I'm only gonna be making half

09:11.424 --> 09:15.426
of what was agreed upon
in writing?

09:15.428 --> 09:17.461
I'd like to speak
to Mr. Danielson.

09:17.463 --> 09:19.931
I'm his plantation foreman.

09:19.933 --> 09:21.467
I speak for him.

09:23.236 --> 09:26.403
Coffee market
drives everything here.

09:26.405 --> 09:30.074
Right now the whole mountain
is in the middle of cutbacks.

09:30.076 --> 09:32.944
All right, when's the next boat
leaving for the mainland?

09:32.946 --> 09:34.378
A month.

09:34.380 --> 09:35.515
A month?

09:40.120 --> 09:43.120
I just about spent everything
I had getting here.

09:43.122 --> 09:45.355
Listen, we need a doctor.

09:45.357 --> 09:47.358
We've lost many to the plague,

09:47.360 --> 09:51.332
including Mrs. Danielson
just two days ago.

09:53.132 --> 09:55.933
How about I work in
a housing arrangement

09:55.935 --> 09:57.937
and some store credit?

10:00.640 --> 10:02.473
All right.

10:02.475 --> 10:05.276
Look, just pay me
what you can for the month,

10:05.278 --> 10:07.445
and I'll see if I can make do.

10:07.447 --> 10:10.384
If not, I take
the next boat back.

10:16.188 --> 10:19.423
Uh, the accommodations
aren't what you're used to.

10:19.425 --> 10:21.127
That's fine.

11:13.178 --> 11:14.448
Oh, no.

11:21.254 --> 11:23.153
Hold on, hold on!

11:23.155 --> 11:25.255
This place is a dump.

11:25.257 --> 11:27.057
How am I supposed
to get back to town?

11:27.059 --> 11:29.359
- <i>Jitensha.</i>
- What?

11:29.361 --> 11:30.731
<i>Jitensha.</i>

12:25.584 --> 12:27.618
- Morning, Doc.
- Morning, Mayor.

12:27.620 --> 12:29.619
How do you like the Kona coffee?

12:29.621 --> 12:31.656
The coffee's fine.

12:31.658 --> 12:35.361
I'm not too happy with
the stench at my new place.

12:38.731 --> 12:40.200
What's with that kid?

12:43.736 --> 12:45.335
I don't know.

12:45.337 --> 12:47.738
He just showed up
out of nowhere.

12:57.650 --> 12:59.783
It's your lucky day.
His wife is sick.

12:59.785 --> 13:01.619
All right, well,
what are the symptoms?

13:02.654 --> 13:03.589
Wife not breathing.

13:05.491 --> 13:07.358
Some of these folks
may need convincing

13:07.360 --> 13:09.127
when it comes to
modern medicine.

13:09.129 --> 13:12.363
That's all right.
I've spent time in the Orient.

14:03.750 --> 14:07.350
My Lord.
Is that the thing that bit her?

14:11.390 --> 14:14.425
Anaphylaxis.

14:14.427 --> 14:16.763
Okay, she had
an allergic reaction.

14:22.401 --> 14:23.768
This is adrenalin.

14:23.770 --> 14:26.737
She needs it,
or she's gonna die.

14:26.739 --> 14:28.806
Trust me. It's gonna help.
It's not an option.

14:32.511 --> 14:33.710
You idiot.

14:33.712 --> 14:35.314
You stupid fool.

14:40.620 --> 14:42.286
You, boy!

14:42.288 --> 14:43.988
Come here, boy. You!

14:43.990 --> 14:45.855
Come on, I don't have time
to play games.

14:45.857 --> 14:47.325
Come here.

14:47.327 --> 14:48.593
I need your help.

14:48.595 --> 14:50.427
Explain to this man

14:50.429 --> 14:52.897
that his wife
is going to die

14:52.899 --> 14:54.431
if she doesn't get
an injection.

14:54.433 --> 14:55.432
Hey!

14:55.434 --> 14:57.401
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

14:57.403 --> 14:59.903
Come on, you can speak,
can't ya? Tell him.

15:07.447 --> 15:10.580
He wishes me to leave.
Hafu bring bad luck.

15:10.582 --> 15:11.581
Ah, go on.

15:11.583 --> 15:12.617
Listen to me.

15:12.619 --> 15:14.784
I got another one like this.

15:14.786 --> 15:18.355
My house is the last one
off the main road

15:18.357 --> 15:19.824
on the left-hand side,
you can't miss it.

15:19.826 --> 15:21.926
There's a red fence
in front, got it?

15:21.928 --> 15:23.326
<i>Baggu.</i>

15:23.328 --> 15:24.894
My house.

15:24.896 --> 15:26.497
You understand?

15:31.670 --> 15:33.606
What the hell was I thinking?

15:40.279 --> 15:41.682
Run, boy.

16:03.303 --> 16:04.404
Come on, kid.

16:18.318 --> 16:19.586
Attaboy.

16:32.564 --> 16:33.599
Hey.

16:43.543 --> 16:45.442
It's all right, kid.

16:45.444 --> 16:47.043
I'm a doctor.

16:47.045 --> 16:48.748
Okay.

16:58.890 --> 17:00.791
That should do the trick.

17:00.793 --> 17:04.560
I can't have my first patient
dying on me, can I?

17:04.563 --> 17:06.097
Yeah, breathe.

17:11.737 --> 17:13.737
You can let him out.

17:15.440 --> 17:16.709
Here you go.

17:20.545 --> 17:22.945
So, kid,

17:22.948 --> 17:25.882
what's your name?

17:25.884 --> 17:28.519
Your name, so I'll know
what to call you.

17:28.521 --> 17:29.587
Jo.

17:29.589 --> 17:32.359
Jo. Hmm.

17:34.393 --> 17:36.092
Jo.

17:36.094 --> 17:38.728
Joseph?

17:38.730 --> 17:40.700
Just Jo.

17:42.534 --> 17:43.836
All right, Jo.

17:47.439 --> 17:51.509
All this mountain climbing
is making me hungry.

17:51.511 --> 17:55.415
What do you say we go back to
town and get something to eat?

18:02.121 --> 18:03.753
So...

18:03.755 --> 18:05.822
how did
the first doctoring go?

18:05.824 --> 18:08.426
Well, she's gonna make it.

18:08.428 --> 18:09.926
That's good.

18:09.928 --> 18:13.164
Thanks to this little youngster
right here.

18:13.166 --> 18:15.099
I see.

18:15.101 --> 18:19.436
Kid, why don't you tell us
where you're from,

18:19.438 --> 18:22.138
so we can help you?

18:22.140 --> 18:24.841
Up mauka, the mountain?

18:24.843 --> 18:26.944
Where's your parents?

18:26.946 --> 18:28.881
Mother, father?

18:38.591 --> 18:39.924
Miyo Watanabe?

18:39.926 --> 18:41.826
Mama.

18:41.828 --> 18:44.561
Mama.

18:44.563 --> 18:46.563
She lived alone,
high up in the mountains

18:46.565 --> 18:49.032
on the other side
of the valley.

18:49.034 --> 18:52.735
She picked alone,
was a bit of a recluse.

18:52.737 --> 18:54.541
We lost her to the plague.

18:55.874 --> 18:57.943
I didn't know she had a kid.

19:02.782 --> 19:06.183
She hid you all this time?

19:06.185 --> 19:07.952
And why would she do that?

19:07.954 --> 19:09.089
Because he's probably...

19:11.189 --> 19:12.926
Because he's probably
a bastard.

19:15.194 --> 19:18.529
Some fling with a haole,
and now he's a hafu boy.

19:18.531 --> 19:22.500
Japs thinks he brings shame
to anyone he's near.

19:22.502 --> 19:24.471
I really wish people
would stop using that word.

19:27.907 --> 19:30.875
Maybe some family
in the mainland would take him.

19:30.877 --> 19:32.943
Let me guess.

19:32.945 --> 19:35.615
Boat leaves when,
in a month?

19:39.919 --> 19:43.055
All right, kid, come on.
You're gonna live with me.

19:55.301 --> 19:57.604
Hey, kid, you got anything
up there worth keeping?

20:00.773 --> 20:02.540
There's nothing to worry about.

20:02.542 --> 20:05.245
Disease,
it dies with the victim.

20:16.221 --> 20:19.792
Okay, kid, let's go.

21:02.301 --> 21:04.037
Is that your mother?

21:11.977 --> 21:13.746
I've lost family.

21:17.984 --> 21:21.150
It's a terrible thing.

21:21.152 --> 21:24.024
But you gotta
keep on going, right?

21:29.794 --> 21:31.931
I'll be outside.
Take your time.

22:07.733 --> 22:10.000
Good morning.

22:10.002 --> 22:11.605
Looks like the whole family's
hard at work.

22:13.339 --> 22:16.208
You can call me Doc,
and this is Jo.

22:20.746 --> 22:23.013
Hafu boy.

22:23.015 --> 22:24.747
Not too sociable.

22:24.749 --> 22:26.385
Come on, kid.

22:27.687 --> 22:28.955
Morning.

22:35.160 --> 22:35.996
Ahem!

22:38.063 --> 22:38.965
Ahem!

22:40.399 --> 22:41.700
Hello!

22:43.768 --> 22:46.070
I'm the new doctor
for the plantation.

22:46.072 --> 22:48.871
I wanted to take
this opportunity

22:48.873 --> 22:51.177
to introduce myself.

22:53.111 --> 22:54.445
Translate, please.

22:54.447 --> 22:56.112
Louder!

22:56.114 --> 22:58.150
Louder, so they can hear you.

23:02.888 --> 23:06.322
I would bow a proper
Japanese introduction,

23:06.324 --> 23:09.225
but I have a bad back
from the war.

23:09.227 --> 23:11.063
I can barely tie my shoes
in the morning.

23:17.469 --> 23:18.769
That's all right.
Did you get it all out?

23:18.771 --> 23:20.103
- Yes.
- Okay.

23:20.105 --> 23:24.374
Now, if any of you
or your loved ones

23:24.376 --> 23:27.311
are sick or get hurt,

23:27.313 --> 23:30.182
you just see Jo,
and he'll come get me.

23:36.388 --> 23:37.122
Okay.

23:39.324 --> 23:40.693
Back to work.

24:23.134 --> 24:26.302
You know, Jo,
you seem pretty smitten

24:26.304 --> 24:29.305
with the big man's
pretty daughter.

24:29.307 --> 24:33.142
These girls get
prettier and prettier,

24:33.144 --> 24:37.814
and, uh,
the prettier they get,

24:37.816 --> 24:40.516
the crazier they get.

24:40.518 --> 24:43.219
That's right, crazy.

24:43.221 --> 24:44.890
Let's go.

25:02.341 --> 25:04.875
<i>Time flies like an arrow.</i>

25:04.877 --> 25:07.109
<i>As time passed,</i>

25:07.111 --> 25:09.913
<i>so did the disease
that plagued our island.</i>

25:09.915 --> 25:12.448
<i>And under the guidance of Doc,</i>

25:12.450 --> 25:15.918
<i>a former outcast
grew into a young man</i>

25:15.920 --> 25:18.257
<i>and a valuable member
of our small community.</i>

25:20.359 --> 25:23.961
<i>A friendly rivalry grew
between Taki the driver,</i>

25:23.963 --> 25:27.397
<i>and Jo the medicine runner.</i>

25:27.399 --> 25:30.169
<i>A daily event that the whole
community looked forward to.</i>

25:34.005 --> 25:36.176
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:46.384 --> 25:48.954
Hyah!

26:05.938 --> 26:07.172
Hyah!

26:12.945 --> 26:14.246
Hyah! Hup! Hup!

26:28.994 --> 26:29.928
Hyah! Hup!

27:06.031 --> 27:07.367
Hyah! Hyah!

27:33.559 --> 27:34.690
Ah!

27:58.316 --> 28:00.016
<i>Each morning,</i>

28:00.018 --> 28:01.752
<i>Mr. Danielson's daughter,
Grace,</i>

28:01.754 --> 28:04.521
<i>would watch from her window
high up on the hill.</i>

28:04.523 --> 28:07.090
<i>It was on this day
that a simple injury</i>

28:07.092 --> 28:10.026
<i>set in motion
a series of events</i>

28:10.028 --> 28:13.098
<i>that would change
our little town forever.</i>

28:39.057 --> 28:43.426
Shut that thing off
before you burn the place down!

28:43.428 --> 28:46.429
Sir, we should consider
selling off assets,

28:46.431 --> 28:48.799
starting from
some of this machinery.

28:48.801 --> 28:50.734
The bank is losing patience.

28:50.736 --> 28:53.438
And who exactly
would buy this machinery?

28:58.377 --> 29:00.409
We could sell the cinema.

29:00.411 --> 29:03.413
The cinema
has a broken projector.

29:03.415 --> 29:06.483
Look, I'm not selling anything.
You need to buy me some time.

29:06.485 --> 29:09.088
I don't care how you do it!

29:17.463 --> 29:20.597
What is it, Miss Hanabusa?
Is Grace all right?

29:20.599 --> 29:22.532
Miss Grace
has sprained her ankle.

29:22.534 --> 29:24.533
I believe she should
see the doctor.

29:24.535 --> 29:27.771
A trip to Hilo isn't exactly
necessary for a sprained ankle.

29:27.773 --> 29:30.607
I mean Dr. Lawrence.
He could come to the house.

29:30.609 --> 29:32.475
Have I not made myself clear

29:32.477 --> 29:34.844
how I feel about
that country doctor?

29:34.846 --> 29:36.847
Do you have any idea

29:36.849 --> 29:38.849
how many germs
he must be carrying around,

29:38.851 --> 29:40.817
treating all these people?

29:40.819 --> 29:43.753
Miss Grace also has
a slight fever.

29:43.755 --> 29:46.656
- Maybe just the ankle.
- A fever?

29:46.658 --> 29:48.657
Perhaps we can take
certain precautions

29:48.659 --> 29:50.095
for the examination.

29:52.797 --> 29:54.534
Fine.

30:11.216 --> 30:13.250
Miss Grace has hurt her ankle.

30:13.252 --> 30:15.151
May the doctor
please come examine it?

30:15.153 --> 30:17.821
Miss Grace?

30:17.823 --> 30:23.659
Well, uh, the doctor's
left for Hilo on the train.

30:23.661 --> 30:26.663
He's picking up
a pharmaceutical order.

30:26.665 --> 30:28.732
He's gonna be back
in two days.

30:28.734 --> 30:31.767
I see.

30:31.769 --> 30:33.738
We will just have
to wait until then.

30:37.176 --> 30:37.877
Wait.

30:40.879 --> 30:44.650
I am very qualified
to tend to such emergencies.

30:46.919 --> 30:50.186
Doc has been training me
for many years, and...

30:50.188 --> 30:54.826
he's asked me to represent him
while he's gone.

30:56.562 --> 30:58.427
Oh, okay.

30:58.429 --> 31:00.296
Really?

31:00.298 --> 31:01.766
Okay, um...

31:03.534 --> 31:05.604
I'm gonna go get my bag.

31:13.245 --> 31:16.213
Dr. Lawrence, you've
clearly been told multiple times

31:16.215 --> 31:19.582
that the Racial Integrity
Guidelines

31:19.584 --> 31:23.453
are in place to discourage
interracial adoption.

31:23.455 --> 31:25.655
That combined with the lack of
any sort of birth certificate,

31:25.657 --> 31:28.591
makes this a practically
impossible case.

31:28.593 --> 31:30.859
Might I suggest you reach out
to the Japanese Consulate,

31:30.861 --> 31:32.861
where they can help find
parents for the boy?

31:32.863 --> 31:34.231
You know, of his own kind.

31:34.233 --> 31:35.698
Listen, Gray.

31:35.700 --> 31:38.635
Uh, sir.

31:38.637 --> 31:41.471
As you're well aware,

31:41.473 --> 31:44.874
I have been trying for years
to adopt this kid,

31:44.876 --> 31:48.811
give him some sort
of legal standing.

31:48.813 --> 31:53.617
I believe this young man
has the makings of a physician,

31:53.619 --> 31:55.885
and I intend to do
everything within my power

31:55.887 --> 31:58.321
to make that happen.

31:58.323 --> 32:01.358
Well, it's extremely unlikely,

32:01.360 --> 32:03.025
but I suppose we could appeal
to the Child Welfare League

32:03.027 --> 32:05.462
in Honolulu.

32:05.464 --> 32:07.263
You'll have to cover the cost
of the trip, my expenses,

32:07.265 --> 32:09.933
a fee to prioritize this case
over everything else.

32:09.935 --> 32:11.501
It's gonna be quite
the tidy sum, Dr. Lawrence.

32:11.503 --> 32:12.936
Even then, I cannot guarantee

32:12.938 --> 32:14.436
that they will give
a favorable outcome

32:14.438 --> 32:16.673
or even review your case.

32:16.675 --> 32:18.444
This is everything I've got.

32:20.278 --> 32:22.280
Make it a priority.

33:21.005 --> 33:22.807
Thank you for coming.
Please wait here.

33:34.486 --> 33:36.653
No!

33:36.655 --> 33:39.789
She can't walk.

33:39.791 --> 33:43.426
I'm afraid it could cause
permanent damage.

33:43.428 --> 33:46.795
The young man has been
learning under Doc for years.

33:46.797 --> 33:48.365
Absolutely out of the question.

33:48.367 --> 33:49.599
I don't even want him
on our front porch,

33:49.601 --> 33:51.834
let alone Grace's bedroom.

33:51.836 --> 33:54.706
Send that boy away!

34:07.386 --> 34:08.784
I'm sorry, but...

34:10.389 --> 34:11.356
Wait here.

34:15.893 --> 34:17.893
Grace, what happened?

34:17.896 --> 34:20.763
- Are you all right?
- I fell.

34:20.764 --> 34:24.501
I thought I could walk,
but it is really painful.

34:24.503 --> 34:26.870
Fine, all right, fine.

34:26.871 --> 34:29.675
Miss Hanabusa,
go and fetch the boy.

34:45.121 --> 34:48.456
Given the exceptional
circumstances,

34:48.458 --> 34:50.525
I'm allowing limited access

34:50.527 --> 34:53.364
to see if you can bring some
relief to my daughter's pain.

35:01.539 --> 35:04.075
I must be out of my mind.

35:05.977 --> 35:07.747
I have urgent business
to attend to.

35:14.552 --> 35:15.420
Sir.

35:19.557 --> 35:24.396
Grace, please show
our young doctor your ankle.

35:32.637 --> 35:36.409
That is all that is injured,
and that is all you need to see.

35:44.849 --> 35:47.149
Uh, miss, could you
put pressure on it?

35:50.222 --> 35:53.555
I don't think it's broken.

35:53.557 --> 35:55.925
It's, uh...

35:55.927 --> 35:59.028
Yeah, I believe it's sprained.

35:59.030 --> 36:00.865
That is good to hear.

36:11.610 --> 36:15.879
I'll give a report back to Doc
as soon as he returns.

36:15.881 --> 36:17.680
Thank you for your service, Jo.

36:17.682 --> 36:19.618
I will see you out.

36:28.727 --> 36:29.825
Bye.

36:29.827 --> 36:32.095
You're an assistant.

36:32.097 --> 36:34.162
You know very well

36:34.164 --> 36:36.798
not to treat anybody
without me being present.

36:36.800 --> 36:39.102
And why is that?
I think I...

36:39.104 --> 36:42.238
You jeopardize
your entire future.

36:42.240 --> 36:44.477
I mean, suppose
something went wrong?

36:46.711 --> 36:51.213
And you did it with
Danielson's daughter, huh?

36:51.215 --> 36:53.084
What are you thinking?

36:55.619 --> 36:56.986
I leave town
for a couple days...

36:56.988 --> 36:59.955
It was just
a sprained ankle, Doc.

36:59.957 --> 37:02.258
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

37:02.260 --> 37:05.595
Yeah, you thought you were
doing the right thing.

37:05.597 --> 37:08.830
You thought you were ready.
I didn't think you were ready.

37:08.832 --> 37:13.236
Evidently, Danielson doesn't
think that you're ready.

37:13.238 --> 37:15.604
He sent word to Hilo.

37:15.606 --> 37:18.774
They're bringing in
another doctor.

37:18.776 --> 37:21.176
Yeah, that's right.

37:21.178 --> 37:23.579
When are you gonna
learn to trust me?

37:23.581 --> 37:24.849
Out of my chair.

37:26.751 --> 37:28.287
When are you gonna trust me?

37:43.934 --> 37:46.970
I still can't believe
they let you in this place.

37:46.972 --> 37:49.972
They've never let me
in this joint.

37:49.974 --> 37:52.240
I'm not sure if it's
a rich haole thing,

37:52.242 --> 37:55.311
but they got some
pretty strange rules.

37:55.313 --> 37:57.946
Yeah, I'm sure they do.

37:57.948 --> 38:00.716
Look, let's just show 'em
that you're a...

38:00.718 --> 38:02.718
Well, you're a qualified
assistant.

38:02.720 --> 38:04.921
Let me have a look at you.

38:04.923 --> 38:07.155
Tuck in your shirt.

38:07.157 --> 38:10.827
And that I'm a proper doctor.

38:10.829 --> 38:14.099
For the record,
I'm still mad at you.

38:15.800 --> 38:17.035
Let's go.

38:24.275 --> 38:26.278
Let's see the princess, okay?

38:39.858 --> 38:41.593
Morning, Mrs. Danielson.

38:47.131 --> 38:48.032
Miss Grace?

38:52.836 --> 38:53.838
Come in.

39:03.048 --> 39:05.347
Is, uh, Mr. Danielson in?

39:05.349 --> 39:07.316
He is engaged elsewhere.

39:07.318 --> 39:09.452
I was given specific
instructions, however.

39:09.454 --> 39:11.354
Oh, I see.

39:11.356 --> 39:14.189
What do we have here?

39:14.191 --> 39:15.892
Okay.

39:15.894 --> 39:18.227
So, young lady,

39:18.229 --> 39:20.262
how's that leg of yours today?

39:20.264 --> 39:23.365
Well, my leg's
doing a bit better,

39:23.367 --> 39:25.167
but now my stomach's
not feeling too well.

39:25.169 --> 39:26.803
I see.

39:26.805 --> 39:29.405
Mine too.

39:29.407 --> 39:31.207
Pardon me?

39:31.209 --> 39:32.207
What?

39:32.209 --> 39:33.876
Oh, um, nothing, Doc.

39:33.878 --> 39:34.776
Something going around, perhaps.

39:34.778 --> 39:35.977
Yeah, okay.

39:35.979 --> 39:37.814
How shall we proceed then?

39:37.816 --> 39:39.816
Is it the stomach
you wish to see or...

39:39.818 --> 39:42.017
I'm sorry, Miss Hanabusa,

39:42.019 --> 39:44.956
but this just isn't practical.

39:47.291 --> 39:51.160
I understand,
but please do hurry.

39:51.162 --> 39:52.894
Won't take but a jiffy.

39:52.896 --> 39:54.796
Now...

39:54.798 --> 39:58.036
let's a have a look at
that ankle, missy, shall we?

40:00.204 --> 40:03.205
- Is it sensitive?
- Yeah.

40:03.207 --> 40:04.142
Mm-hmm.

40:05.276 --> 40:07.510
That's nice work.

40:07.512 --> 40:09.845
How about that?
How's it feel if I do that?

40:09.847 --> 40:12.215
Still a bit painful.

40:12.217 --> 40:14.850
It's a sprain, all right.

40:14.852 --> 40:18.287
What about that
secondary condition?

40:18.289 --> 40:21.325
How do you recommend
we proceed, Jo?

40:25.463 --> 40:27.032
Well?

40:29.133 --> 40:31.102
Huh. Hmm.

40:38.443 --> 40:40.376
Um...

40:40.378 --> 40:43.445
Have you had any vomiting
or diarrhea?

40:43.447 --> 40:44.248
No.

40:46.383 --> 40:50.385
Well, if you would
hold out your wrists, miss,

40:50.387 --> 40:52.724
I, uh, I'm gonna
check your pulse.

41:02.432 --> 41:05.133
It's, uh...

41:05.135 --> 41:07.139
a little faster than normal.

41:09.139 --> 41:12.076
You know, perhaps
you should take her temperature.

41:13.510 --> 41:15.443
Um...

41:15.445 --> 41:16.414
Yes, of course.

41:25.823 --> 41:26.892
Jo, not that.

41:28.992 --> 41:30.161
Here it is.

41:33.298 --> 41:37.200
So I will be
placing this under...

41:37.202 --> 41:39.936
uh, your tongue,

41:39.938 --> 41:42.407
if that's all right with you.

41:53.852 --> 41:57.122
And, uh, we just gotta
wait a moment.

42:10.602 --> 42:12.304
- Okay, that's long enough.
- Oh, yeah.

42:16.573 --> 42:19.541
Well, what does it say?

42:19.543 --> 42:22.077
Oh.

42:22.079 --> 42:23.579
She has no temperature.

42:23.581 --> 42:26.282
Ah, for she...
No temperature.

42:26.284 --> 42:28.184
Dead.

42:28.186 --> 42:29.452
Uh, no fever.

42:29.454 --> 42:32.153
What does she have?

42:32.155 --> 42:35.360
Probably just a bug or nerves.

42:37.061 --> 42:38.894
Nerves, huh?

42:38.896 --> 42:41.430
Well, is there anything
that we can give her?

42:41.432 --> 42:43.265
Maybe we could
give her some herbs?

42:43.267 --> 42:44.666
Something like that?

42:44.668 --> 42:46.234
Basil.

42:46.236 --> 42:48.271
We can give her some basil.

42:48.273 --> 42:49.207
Um...

42:52.376 --> 42:55.176
Turn these basil leaves
into a tea,

42:55.178 --> 42:58.146
and, uh, if you've got
a ginger root,

42:58.148 --> 43:00.283
it'll help with her stomach.

43:00.285 --> 43:01.987
Thank you, doctors.

43:03.387 --> 43:05.187
Thank you.

43:05.189 --> 43:08.093
- Uh, Miss Hanabusa, I...
- Thank you.

43:11.361 --> 43:13.396
- Keep that elevated.
- I will.

43:13.398 --> 43:14.566
Thank you, Doctor.

43:18.102 --> 43:23.439
Jo will drop off
some more herbs tomorrow.

43:23.441 --> 43:26.008
Please do greet Mr. Danielson
for us, would you?

43:26.010 --> 43:27.709
I will. Thank you again.

43:27.711 --> 43:29.046
Thank you.

43:56.606 --> 43:57.409
So?

43:59.343 --> 44:00.443
So what?

44:00.445 --> 44:02.278
How do you think you performed?

44:02.280 --> 44:05.481
Decisive? Confident?

44:05.483 --> 44:08.249
- I was fine, I guess.
- You were a babbling simpleton.

44:08.251 --> 44:09.651
Okay, that's not
really fair, Doc.

44:09.653 --> 44:12.354
I saw the way you were looking
at the girl, okay?

44:12.356 --> 44:14.557
Look, doctoring requires focus,

44:14.559 --> 44:17.359
emotional self-control,
and discipline.

44:17.361 --> 44:19.097
You're not a kid anymore.

44:43.354 --> 44:47.256
All right, after you
drop off those herbs,

44:47.258 --> 44:49.624
meet me at the coffee mill.

44:49.626 --> 44:51.760
When you get to the house,
ring the bell,

44:51.762 --> 44:54.562
hand the herbs
to Miss Hanabusa.

44:54.564 --> 44:56.399
Don't engage with any of
the other family members

44:56.401 --> 44:57.600
and stay out of the house,
you got it?

44:57.602 --> 45:00.102
- Yeah, I got it.
- You got what?

45:00.104 --> 45:02.704
Ring the bell,
hand the herbs to Miss Hanabusa,

45:02.706 --> 45:04.707
and I'll meet you
at the coffee mill.

45:04.709 --> 45:06.441
Okay.

45:06.443 --> 45:08.612
And fix the hinges
on that door.

45:49.186 --> 45:50.619
Good morning, boy.

45:55.492 --> 45:57.792
Could you tell me
where the Danielson home is?

45:57.794 --> 46:01.097
Yeah, it's about
a 30-minute walk that way.

46:01.099 --> 46:02.530
Speak up. I can't hear ya.

46:02.532 --> 46:03.599
It's about a 30-minute walk
that way!

46:03.601 --> 46:06.371
All right, silly boy.

46:08.639 --> 46:11.372
Not for me, it's not.

47:35.258 --> 47:37.628
Damn contraption.

47:52.742 --> 47:54.709
No, no, no,
that won't be necessary.

47:54.711 --> 47:56.945
We have a real doctor here.

47:56.947 --> 47:58.948
Grace!

47:58.950 --> 48:01.283
This is Dr. Reyes.

48:01.285 --> 48:04.285
He recently moved to Hilo
from the mainland.

48:04.287 --> 48:06.624
He's here to offer us
a second opinion.

48:08.291 --> 48:10.392
Hello, Miss Grace.

48:10.394 --> 48:12.928
Why, aren't you
a true beauty.

48:12.930 --> 48:14.896
She is.

48:14.898 --> 48:18.169
How may I be of service, hmm?

48:20.738 --> 48:23.271
She should be fine
with those pills.

48:23.273 --> 48:25.441
I would, however,
like to check on her again.

48:25.443 --> 48:26.908
Of course.

48:26.910 --> 48:29.745
Why don't you stay for lunch?

48:29.747 --> 48:32.651
How generous of you.
That would be lovely.

48:36.753 --> 48:39.754
Grace is lucky to have
such a quality doctor.

48:39.756 --> 48:41.559
She certainly is.

48:44.829 --> 48:48.265
Oh, for God's sake.
What's he doing here?

48:52.869 --> 48:56.338
Good morning, Mr. Danielson,
Miss Danielson.

48:56.340 --> 48:57.939
Doc asked me to come by

48:57.941 --> 48:59.941
and drop off some more herbs
for Miss Grace.

48:59.943 --> 49:01.776
No, no, no, no,
that won't be necessary.

49:01.778 --> 49:04.879
Miss Grace is now under the care
of a proper physician.

49:04.881 --> 49:07.015
You and the Doc
may take care of the Orientals

49:07.017 --> 49:08.816
and the other laborers.

49:08.818 --> 49:11.919
Dr. Reyes will be taking care
of the rest of us.

49:13.823 --> 49:15.693
Yes, sir.

49:18.863 --> 49:20.695
Oh!

49:20.697 --> 49:22.463
♪ It's up to me
It's up to me ♪

49:22.465 --> 49:24.332
- Wonderful that you're staying.
- Great day!

49:59.803 --> 50:01.704
May I, Mrs. Danielson?

50:01.706 --> 50:04.539
- Oh, please do.
- Let's work up an appetite.

50:16.419 --> 50:18.620
Oh, my!

50:18.622 --> 50:21.055
I haven't danced like this
for years.

50:31.568 --> 50:33.836
Look, I, uh...

50:33.838 --> 50:36.374
brought these for you.

50:37.775 --> 50:38.907
Thank you.

50:45.950 --> 50:47.416
Come with me.

50:47.418 --> 50:49.084
It's okay.

50:57.427 --> 50:59.096
Come on, Jo.

51:07.805 --> 51:09.470
Uh, I'm Jo.

51:09.472 --> 51:12.474
Yeah, I know.

51:12.476 --> 51:13.575
I'm Grace.

51:13.577 --> 51:14.609
I know.

51:16.146 --> 51:17.412
- You have...
- So what's...

51:18.416 --> 51:19.715
Sorry.

51:19.717 --> 51:22.751
- Um, you first.
- Okay.

51:22.753 --> 51:25.454
What's your favorite part
of the island?

51:25.456 --> 51:27.890
Well, I, uh...

51:27.892 --> 51:29.758
I love to go up
to the top of mountain.

51:31.961 --> 51:34.896
- You should go.
- Yeah, I'll go.

51:34.898 --> 51:36.734
But first,
just close your eyes.

51:44.073 --> 51:46.774
And, uh...

51:46.776 --> 51:48.075
just hold...

51:48.077 --> 51:50.611
very...

51:50.613 --> 51:51.615
still.

52:16.840 --> 52:19.707
What is it?

52:26.150 --> 52:27.751
Foreclosure.

52:30.253 --> 52:31.889
Foreclosure.

52:34.492 --> 52:36.691
How could you let this happen?

52:36.693 --> 52:40.028
I told you to buy me more time,
you stupid man.

52:42.532 --> 52:44.066
I tried, sir.

52:44.068 --> 52:46.535
I did exactly as you told me to.

52:46.537 --> 52:50.705
Oh, I... I just have to...
You enjoy yourself.

52:50.707 --> 52:53.075
Oh, yeah, yeah, go, go.

52:53.077 --> 52:56.544
Miss Grace, what are you
doing down here?

52:56.546 --> 53:00.082
Oh, um, I'm just getting
a few flowers for my room.

53:12.095 --> 53:16.664
Why, I also invested
all of my private savings

53:16.666 --> 53:18.233
and mortgaged my home.

53:18.235 --> 53:20.736
It is all gone now.

53:20.738 --> 53:23.070
I, too, am ruined.

53:23.072 --> 53:24.606
You are ruined?

53:24.608 --> 53:28.075
What do you even have
to be ruined?

53:28.077 --> 53:29.646
Get out!

53:36.586 --> 53:38.320
What is it, son?

53:38.322 --> 53:40.622
Everything okay?

53:40.624 --> 53:42.189
It's fine, Mother.
I have to go to Hilo tomorrow

53:42.191 --> 53:44.626
to sort out an issue
with the bank.

53:44.628 --> 53:48.162
Do not patronize me.

53:48.164 --> 53:50.869
Now tell me
what the hell's going on.

53:53.269 --> 53:57.673
The bank is repossessing
the plantation, the businesses,

53:57.675 --> 54:01.211
the buildings in town,
all of it in 30 days.

54:09.753 --> 54:12.120
We're going to be
cast out into the street.

54:12.122 --> 54:14.021
No. I put the house
in Grace's name,

54:14.023 --> 54:15.823
Miss Hanabusa
as her official guardian.

54:15.825 --> 54:16.925
The bank's can't touch it.

54:16.927 --> 54:19.327
How could you let this happen?

54:19.329 --> 54:22.830
I can't control
the world coffee market, Mother.

54:22.832 --> 54:24.633
I did what I had to do.

54:24.635 --> 54:27.336
And while you,
you have been guzzling gin,

54:27.338 --> 54:31.273
I have been fighting every day
to keep this plantation,

54:31.275 --> 54:32.977
this town alive!

54:34.611 --> 54:36.747
Keep your voice down.

54:37.847 --> 54:38.916
Oh...

54:40.284 --> 54:42.553
Think what people will say.

54:45.322 --> 54:47.289
Surely...

54:47.291 --> 54:50.024
Surely there's some way
we can fix this.

54:50.026 --> 54:52.093
It would take a miracle.

54:52.095 --> 54:54.829
Oh, Nana?

54:54.831 --> 54:58.235
I beg your pardon.
Lovey, come for a spin.

55:04.742 --> 55:08.709
Grace, I'm delighted that you
have made a full recovery.

55:08.711 --> 55:10.747
That's the magic
of modern medicine.

55:11.849 --> 55:13.017
You look fantastic.

55:15.285 --> 55:17.151
When I was checking on you,

55:17.153 --> 55:20.358
I noticed that
you fancy fashion.

55:21.825 --> 55:24.760
So I brought you something

55:24.762 --> 55:27.097
that I think
you just might like.

55:31.001 --> 55:33.702
This is a fashion magazine.

55:33.704 --> 55:36.238
Straight off the ship
from the mainland.

55:36.240 --> 55:37.675
Mr. Danielson.

55:38.742 --> 55:40.778
Goodness gracious.

55:46.215 --> 55:49.017
It's for you.

55:54.023 --> 55:55.125
Thank you, Dr. Reyes.

55:57.126 --> 55:59.760
Not at the table, Grace.

55:59.762 --> 56:01.963
You're too generous, Doctor.

56:01.965 --> 56:03.798
Maybe one day
she'll be able to visit

56:03.800 --> 56:06.767
the fashion capitals
of the world, like I have.

56:06.769 --> 56:10.104
Paris is simply...

56:10.106 --> 56:13.075
It's magical.

56:13.077 --> 56:14.845
I'm so... silly.

56:16.479 --> 56:19.080
So, Danielson,

56:19.082 --> 56:21.749
how is business these days?

56:21.751 --> 56:23.751
The truth is,
the Japanese independent farmers

56:23.753 --> 56:26.187
are driving down
the price of coffee.

56:26.189 --> 56:28.457
Unbelievable.

56:28.459 --> 56:33.461
The damn lava rocks don't
allow us to farm sugar up here.

56:33.463 --> 56:36.832
Thankfully,
I've found ways to diversify,

56:36.834 --> 56:38.899
and the business
couldn't be better.

56:38.901 --> 56:41.436
Why, that is good to hear.

56:41.438 --> 56:43.405
Speaking of diversifying,

56:43.407 --> 56:46.108
you should consider opening
an office here on the Kona side.

56:46.110 --> 56:48.977
Expand your practice.

56:48.979 --> 56:50.979
You could work
out of one of my buildings.

56:50.981 --> 56:52.414
That's a kind offer, sir,

56:52.416 --> 56:55.283
but don't you already
have a doctor here?

56:55.285 --> 56:57.419
- Dr. Lawrence?
- Mm-hmm.

56:57.421 --> 57:00.921
Well, his country medicine
works for our pickers,

57:00.923 --> 57:05.160
but I see a real need
for proper medical attention

57:05.162 --> 57:06.327
for the genteel folk.

57:06.329 --> 57:07.863
Thank you, sir.

57:07.865 --> 57:11.332
I just may take you up on it.

57:11.334 --> 57:13.434
Well, how about
you stay another day,

57:13.436 --> 57:17.305
and I'll show you
some options to consider?

57:17.307 --> 57:20.175
Only if I can come by
for another visit

57:20.177 --> 57:22.309
to check on
my most lovely patient.

57:22.311 --> 57:25.847
Oh, yes, please do, Doctor.

57:27.117 --> 57:29.320
Such wonderful people.

58:03.553 --> 58:04.986
Boy.

58:04.988 --> 58:07.021
- Um...
- May I help you?

58:07.023 --> 58:09.557
Sorry, sir, it's just
your motorcar's something else.

58:09.559 --> 58:11.559
Yes, it is.

58:11.561 --> 58:14.896
I tried racing you back there,
but you left me in the dust.

58:14.898 --> 58:18.033
That was you? Hah!

58:18.035 --> 58:20.167
You didn't even have a chance.

58:20.169 --> 58:22.504
I run medicine for Doc
all over this mountain,

58:22.506 --> 58:25.209
and I've never been beaten
until you.

58:27.244 --> 58:28.446
Interesting.

58:31.113 --> 58:33.881
Perhaps you'd like to be
on a winning team...

58:35.418 --> 58:37.454
and go for an evening ride.

58:59.575 --> 59:01.575
Kinda nice, huh?

59:01.577 --> 59:06.481
What do you do about your
patients that don't have roads?

59:06.483 --> 59:09.950
Well, all my patients
have roads.

59:15.124 --> 59:18.126
It's the magic
of modern medicine...

59:18.128 --> 59:20.128
at its best.

59:20.130 --> 59:24.099
Um, would you be willing
to teach me?

59:24.101 --> 59:27.269
I could be your assistant.
I'd work for free.

59:27.271 --> 59:30.171
I've been running for Doc for...

59:30.173 --> 59:32.039
I don't even know
how many years.

59:32.041 --> 59:33.510
Years you say, huh?

59:35.678 --> 59:39.414
Well, I could use some help
setting up the new office,

59:39.416 --> 59:42.249
fetching supplies and such.

59:42.251 --> 59:44.285
Local knowledge
could come in handy.

59:44.287 --> 59:46.687
Yeah, I could do all of that.

59:46.689 --> 59:49.024
Absolutely.

59:49.026 --> 59:51.693
But I could also assist you
in doctoring.

59:51.695 --> 59:54.361
I've treated Miss Grace
Danielson three times now,

59:54.363 --> 59:57.499
and I'm getting
quite good at it.

59:57.501 --> 59:59.600
You say you treated
Grace Danielson?

59:59.602 --> 01:00:04.374
Yeah. Well, the third time
wasn't an official treatment.

01:00:08.611 --> 01:00:13.347
Boy, do you have a crush
on the Danielsons' daughter?

01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:18.218
Mmm!

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:20.622
That's as likely to work out
as you outrunning this car!

01:00:23.994 --> 01:00:29.597
All right, we will meet
in the morning at the hotel.

01:00:29.599 --> 01:00:32.300
But first you must drink up.

01:00:32.302 --> 01:00:34.970
Put some hair on your chest.

01:00:34.972 --> 01:00:38.042
Impress the Danielson daughter.

01:00:47.651 --> 01:00:49.387
Oh.

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.488
At least I know
where you were.

01:00:56.559 --> 01:01:00.495
You were supposed to be
running medicine for me,

01:01:00.497 --> 01:01:03.064
not gallivanting
with the competition.

01:01:03.066 --> 01:01:06.468
Well, he's offered to teach me
modern techniques.

01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:08.736
Modern techniques?

01:01:08.738 --> 01:01:12.407
Why do you keep trying
to stop me from doctoring?

01:01:12.409 --> 01:01:15.075
- Are you drunk?
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:15.077 --> 01:01:18.412
Or are you just stupid
or maybe both?

01:01:18.414 --> 01:01:23.218
The only thing
I'm trying to keep is our jobs.

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:25.419
Okay, now I'm going to bed.

01:01:25.421 --> 01:01:27.622
Enjoy riding your bicycle.

01:01:27.624 --> 01:01:31.693
I'm gonna be in a Ford Model T
with four wheels.

01:01:31.695 --> 01:01:34.361
Your bicycle has two.
Two wheels.

01:01:35.664 --> 01:01:37.365
Four wheels is better.

01:01:49.079 --> 01:01:50.278
Yes.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.582
Thank you.

01:01:52.816 --> 01:01:54.448
Ah!

01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:56.785
Boy, it is good
that you are here.

01:01:56.787 --> 01:01:58.787
Today you will learn
from the best.

01:01:58.789 --> 01:02:00.454
We have an emergency.

01:02:00.456 --> 01:02:02.057
Now, you do speak
Japanese, right?

01:02:02.059 --> 01:02:03.457
- Yes, sir.
- Open the door, please.

01:02:03.459 --> 01:02:05.059
And start the engine.
Thank you.

01:02:05.061 --> 01:02:06.260
Here you are.

01:02:06.262 --> 01:02:08.595
Let's go, go, go!

01:02:08.597 --> 01:02:09.766
Right.

01:02:12.269 --> 01:02:15.503
Hold. Thank you.

01:02:15.505 --> 01:02:19.106
So there's been an emergency
at the coffee mill.

01:02:19.108 --> 01:02:22.577
The man we're going to see
is refusing to speak English.

01:02:22.579 --> 01:02:24.312
Did I ask you
if you spoke Japanese?

01:02:24.314 --> 01:02:27.582
Yes, sir, yes, you did, sir.

01:02:27.584 --> 01:02:30.151
Hey!

01:02:30.153 --> 01:02:31.318
Out of the way!

01:02:34.791 --> 01:02:36.691
Ring the bell, boy.

01:02:37.793 --> 01:02:39.193
Get off the road!

01:02:39.195 --> 01:02:41.398
I'm a doctor!
Out of the way!

01:02:48.338 --> 01:02:50.238
Dusted him!

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.606
Good riddance!

01:02:51.608 --> 01:02:53.443
These people...

01:03:02.485 --> 01:03:04.452
What the hell is he doing here?

01:03:04.454 --> 01:03:07.588
The message said the patient
was only speaking Japanese,

01:03:07.590 --> 01:03:09.823
which the boy understands.

01:03:09.825 --> 01:03:13.628
I assume he has your trust,
having treated your daughter.

01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:15.396
Well, follow me.

01:03:15.398 --> 01:03:16.767
It's my accountant.

01:03:19.302 --> 01:03:22.137
Now, just fix him.
He means a lot to the company.

01:03:22.139 --> 01:03:23.470
How long has he
been this way?

01:03:23.472 --> 01:03:25.108
About an hour or so.

01:03:30.747 --> 01:03:33.780
Well, what's he saying, boy?
What's he saying?

01:03:33.782 --> 01:03:34.751
He wishes to die.

01:03:38.688 --> 01:03:41.455
Fugu. Puffer fish poison.

01:03:41.457 --> 01:03:43.658
It's an honorable suicide.

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:45.559
Nonsense.
We're going to save him.

01:03:45.561 --> 01:03:47.829
Come here. Look, boy.

01:03:47.831 --> 01:03:49.265
Hold him.

01:04:00.209 --> 01:04:03.745
Boy, the smelling salts
to revive him.

01:04:03.747 --> 01:04:06.314
Sir, shouldn't we use the
charcoal to bind the poison?

01:04:06.316 --> 01:04:09.184
Right. Get me some.

01:04:18.195 --> 01:04:19.593
Steady now.

01:04:21.898 --> 01:04:22.900
Yes.

01:04:24.834 --> 01:04:25.836
Yes.

01:04:32.842 --> 01:04:35.609
Maybe if we can get him
to vomit, sir?

01:04:35.611 --> 01:04:37.514
What do you think
I was trying to do?

01:04:44.421 --> 01:04:45.519
Damn it.

01:04:50.559 --> 01:04:52.593
Excuse me, sir, may I try?

01:04:52.595 --> 01:04:54.532
Yeah, have at it.

01:05:00.236 --> 01:05:01.903
And?

01:05:01.905 --> 01:05:03.738
I'm afraid we may have
been too late.

01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:05.872
Your man has taken
a heavy does of poison.

01:05:05.874 --> 01:05:07.274
So sorry.

01:05:09.912 --> 01:05:12.650
Looks like the charcoal's
finally kicked in.

01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:17.885
I assume this is some sort
of crazy Jap tradition?

01:05:17.887 --> 01:05:22.256
It's meant to avoid
shame for the family.

01:05:22.258 --> 01:05:24.925
It's a coward's way out
for a Nip, if you ask me.

01:05:27.396 --> 01:05:28.532
Read it.

01:05:29.999 --> 01:05:32.966
Troubled marriage.
Best not to pry.

01:05:32.968 --> 01:05:36.407
Go on, off you go.

01:05:38.842 --> 01:05:39.809
Come.

01:05:48.952 --> 01:05:52.320
Find a new translator.
That boy can't be trusted.

01:05:52.322 --> 01:05:54.622
I couldn't agree with you more.

01:05:54.624 --> 01:05:55.593
Hmmph!

01:05:57.626 --> 01:06:00.630
Great day.
It's gonna be a great day.

01:06:07.403 --> 01:06:09.637
I don't think
this is gonna work.

01:06:09.639 --> 01:06:11.805
I hate to take Doc's best man.

01:06:19.849 --> 01:06:23.950
Gray, Gray,
listen to me, okay?

01:06:23.952 --> 01:06:25.820
We've been through this before.

01:06:25.822 --> 01:06:27.789
This isn't about
legal precedent.

01:06:27.791 --> 01:06:29.923
It's not about bureaucracy.

01:06:29.925 --> 01:06:32.559
This is about a boy
who deserves a future.

01:06:32.561 --> 01:06:34.595
<i>Your loyalty
is admirable, Dr. Lawrence,</i>

01:06:34.597 --> 01:06:37.497
- <i>but this is impossible.</i>
- <i>Please, Mr. Gray, please.</i>

01:06:37.499 --> 01:06:39.436
- Make it happen.
- <i>Dr. Law...</i>

01:07:42.164 --> 01:07:44.731
And for dessert, my dear,
we have your favorite:

01:07:44.733 --> 01:07:47.100
mango pie with cream.

01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:58.678
This is a very special occasion.

01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:01.749
Today I talked with Dr. Reyes,

01:08:01.751 --> 01:08:03.517
and we had a very important
conversation

01:08:03.519 --> 01:08:05.553
that concerns us all.

01:08:05.555 --> 01:08:08.423
Okay.

01:08:08.425 --> 01:08:10.024
The distinguished doctor

01:08:10.026 --> 01:08:12.459
has taken an interest in you,
my dear.

01:08:12.461 --> 01:08:14.928
Quite flattering.

01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:17.131
He lost his wife
to typhoid 10 years ago

01:08:17.133 --> 01:08:20.635
and has been seeking
a replacement for some time.

01:08:20.636 --> 01:08:22.537
Thank you.

01:08:22.538 --> 01:08:24.671
A replacement?

01:08:24.674 --> 01:08:26.908
A replacement, yes.

01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:29.510
To be his wife.

01:08:29.511 --> 01:08:31.212
Well, he's twice my age.
You can't mean that I...

01:08:31.214 --> 01:08:35.550
Dr. Reyes is clearly
a man of means and status.

01:08:35.551 --> 01:08:37.952
You'd be lucky
to wed such a man,

01:08:37.953 --> 01:08:41.520
regardless of what
his birthdate is.

01:08:41.523 --> 01:08:45.059
You think I wanted
to marry your grandfather?

01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:46.194
After the marriage,

01:08:46.196 --> 01:08:47.528
he plans to invest
in the plantation.

01:08:47.529 --> 01:08:49.029
He has his own money.

01:08:49.031 --> 01:08:51.163
Family money, of course.

01:08:51.166 --> 01:08:53.834
I'm sure he
didn't need to become a doctor.

01:08:53.836 --> 01:08:57.136
No, he just wanted
to serve his fellow man.

01:08:57.139 --> 01:08:59.104
An admirable quality.

01:08:59.107 --> 01:09:01.207
I'm off to Hilo tomorrow
to inform the banks.

01:09:01.210 --> 01:09:03.546
The doctor will be
calling on you.

01:09:04.947 --> 01:09:08.615
He says he has
a surprise for us all.

01:09:08.617 --> 01:09:10.086
Please be ready.

01:09:11.554 --> 01:09:14.555
- A miracle.
- Ah.

01:09:14.557 --> 01:09:16.224
A miracle.

01:09:16.225 --> 01:09:18.191
A miracle?

01:09:18.193 --> 01:09:21.229
You think that selling your
only daughter off is a miracle?

01:09:21.231 --> 01:09:22.566
Gra...

01:09:24.834 --> 01:09:27.734
What a rude, ungrateful child!

01:09:55.264 --> 01:09:58.968
Whatever happens, Miss Grace,
I'll be here with you.

01:10:03.872 --> 01:10:05.843
Dr. Reyes will be here soon.

01:10:35.772 --> 01:10:38.008
I got something for you.

01:10:39.642 --> 01:10:41.676
Up from the valley peak.

01:10:41.678 --> 01:10:46.314
It is the most beautiful place.

01:10:46.316 --> 01:10:50.521
The ocean is so blue,
and it goes on forever.

01:10:53.255 --> 01:10:56.526
And I promise
I'll take you there someday.

01:10:59.295 --> 01:11:01.095
Um...

01:11:01.097 --> 01:11:02.997
Yeah.

01:11:02.999 --> 01:11:03.867
Naupaka flower.

01:11:06.102 --> 01:11:08.037
They're beautiful.

01:11:09.339 --> 01:11:10.774
Do you know the story?

01:11:13.209 --> 01:11:17.811
Well, two of them together
make a whole flower.

01:11:17.813 --> 01:11:20.648
They're only by the sea
and way up mauka.

01:11:20.650 --> 01:11:22.083
Never in-between.

01:11:22.085 --> 01:11:23.818
They're named after a princess

01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:26.186
who fell in love
with a commoner.

01:11:26.188 --> 01:11:30.026
And for that,
they were banished.

01:11:33.196 --> 01:11:35.032
One by the sea,
and one up the mountain.

01:11:36.698 --> 01:11:37.800
Banished.

01:11:40.836 --> 01:11:44.070
There's gotta be a way
we can shorten the distance

01:11:44.072 --> 01:11:45.776
between the mountain
and the ocean.

01:11:47.143 --> 01:11:48.078
Jo...

01:11:53.383 --> 01:11:55.016
What's wrong?

01:11:55.018 --> 01:11:58.255
Father found a match for me.

01:12:00.889 --> 01:12:03.324
It's the new doctor.

01:12:03.326 --> 01:12:05.059
Dr. Reyes.

01:12:05.061 --> 01:12:06.694
The wedding's in two weeks

01:12:06.696 --> 01:12:09.763
at Grandmother's
favorite picnic spot.

01:12:09.765 --> 01:12:12.166
He comes from a rich family
in the mainland,

01:12:12.168 --> 01:12:15.336
and Father says that it might be
the last opportunity

01:12:15.338 --> 01:12:18.204
that my family gets.

01:12:41.063 --> 01:12:42.665
You have to go.

01:12:56.411 --> 01:12:58.779
Grace, Grace, get over here.

01:12:58.781 --> 01:12:59.716
Quick, sit down.

01:13:05.088 --> 01:13:06.122
Ah.

01:13:09.759 --> 01:13:11.324
Good evening.

01:13:11.326 --> 01:13:14.828
Allow me to introduce you
to my daughter Helen.

01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:17.797
You must be Grace.
I've heard so much about you.

01:13:17.799 --> 01:13:19.900
Here you are, love.

01:13:19.902 --> 01:13:24.137
Yes, there you are, Grace.

01:13:24.139 --> 01:13:26.442
Oh, yes, would you like
to sit down?

01:13:29.978 --> 01:13:31.479
Indeed, help yourself.

01:13:31.481 --> 01:13:32.980
Mmm! I will.

01:13:32.982 --> 01:13:36.016
You have a very beautiful home.

01:13:36.018 --> 01:13:37.454
I can't wait to move in.

01:13:39.054 --> 01:13:41.254
Relax, honey.

01:13:41.256 --> 01:13:44.758
We just got here.

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:46.295
That's a lovely color on you.

01:13:50.198 --> 01:13:52.199
Right! Who would like
some coffee?

01:13:52.201 --> 01:13:53.400
- Oh, yes.
- I would love some.

01:13:53.402 --> 01:13:56.403
Good idea. Coffee.

01:13:56.405 --> 01:13:59.175
- Mm, mm, mm, mm!
- Thank you.

01:14:29.472 --> 01:14:31.407
Volcano's at it again.

01:14:33.308 --> 01:14:34.244
Yeah.

01:14:43.451 --> 01:14:44.454
Hmm.

01:14:49.025 --> 01:14:51.859
Danielson girl?

01:14:51.861 --> 01:14:56.099
Her father is gonna marry her
off to that rich haole.

01:15:00.001 --> 01:15:02.004
There's nothing
I can do about it.

01:15:04.874 --> 01:15:07.144
It's like I didn't even exist.

01:15:09.545 --> 01:15:14.381
You know,
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:15:14.383 --> 01:15:16.583
But I wouldn't give up,
if I were you.

01:15:16.585 --> 01:15:18.120
No way.

01:15:20.255 --> 01:15:22.957
It's not over yet.

01:15:22.959 --> 01:15:26.060
If you're meant
to be with Grace,

01:15:26.062 --> 01:15:27.264
it's gonna happen.

01:15:29.165 --> 01:15:30.467
Trust me.

01:15:46.415 --> 01:15:47.580
<i>Tomorrow...</i>

01:15:47.582 --> 01:15:49.516
<i>Tomorrow's wind will blow.</i>

01:15:49.518 --> 01:15:51.886
<i>And blow it did.</i>

01:15:51.888 --> 01:15:53.654
<i>On certain days,</i>

01:15:53.656 --> 01:15:56.257
<i>the trade winds would
carry the volcanic gasses</i>

01:15:56.259 --> 01:15:58.458
<i>to our side of the island.</i>

01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:01.995
<i>We call this
white blanket "vog."</i>

01:16:01.997 --> 01:16:05.335
<i>Doc and Jo were quite busy
on these trying days.</i>

01:16:11.907 --> 01:16:14.240
These people
should be home.

01:16:14.242 --> 01:16:16.146
They shouldn't be
breathing this in.

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:21.916
If they lose their crops,
they lose their jobs.

01:16:31.427 --> 01:16:33.927
Keep it coming, Jo.

01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:37.698
This is peppermint oil.

01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:39.169
Breathe it in.

01:17:13.369 --> 01:17:15.438
Good work, Jo.
Let's get outta here.

01:17:25.046 --> 01:17:27.314
We wouldn't be in the is mess

01:17:27.316 --> 01:17:29.352
if you'd taken better care
of your wagon.

01:17:31.053 --> 01:17:33.055
I hate this place.

01:17:41.229 --> 01:17:44.433
Foggiest day of the year,
and I'm stuck up here with you.

01:17:46.102 --> 01:17:48.401
I'm gonna miss my train.

01:17:48.403 --> 01:17:50.069
I'm supposed to be
in Hilo by tonight,

01:17:50.071 --> 01:17:52.708
and I'm gonna miss my train.

01:17:55.244 --> 01:17:56.577
Go on, get out of...

01:17:56.579 --> 01:17:59.512
- Just get out of the way!
- Mr. Danielson!

01:17:59.514 --> 01:18:01.481
Oh!

01:18:01.483 --> 01:18:02.649
Mr. Danielson!

01:18:02.651 --> 01:18:05.218
No! No!

01:18:12.193 --> 01:18:14.597
Mr. Danielson?
Mr. Danielson!

01:18:23.671 --> 01:18:25.705
Danielson?

01:18:34.282 --> 01:18:35.451
What's that?

01:18:59.775 --> 01:19:02.476
Okay, okay,
I got it, I got it.

01:19:02.478 --> 01:19:05.779
All right, what happened?

01:19:05.781 --> 01:19:08.385
He fell from up there.
I think his leg's broken.

01:19:16.192 --> 01:19:18.758
It's not the leg
I'm worried about.

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:21.464
Mr. Danielson,
where does your head hurt?

01:19:24.467 --> 01:19:26.499
Subdural hematoma is my guess.

01:19:26.501 --> 01:19:28.468
Not good.

01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:29.837
Run and get Reyes.

01:19:29.839 --> 01:19:31.305
We're gonna need
that contraption of his

01:19:31.307 --> 01:19:33.207
to get him outta here.

01:19:33.209 --> 01:19:34.077
I'm on it.

01:19:35.143 --> 01:19:36.079
Run.

01:19:41.183 --> 01:19:43.820
Reyes! Reyes!

01:19:44.887 --> 01:19:46.352
Hey!

01:19:46.354 --> 01:19:47.320
We need help!

01:19:47.322 --> 01:19:48.422
We need help!

01:19:48.424 --> 01:19:50.190
What's all the ruckus, boy?

01:19:50.192 --> 01:19:52.429
Mr. Danielson is injured!
We need your motorcar!

01:19:54.496 --> 01:19:56.298
I've got this one, madam.

01:20:08.777 --> 01:20:10.310
Danielson, hang in there.

01:20:10.312 --> 01:20:12.749
Doc? Doc!
I got Reyes!

01:20:23.192 --> 01:20:25.758
Good God, man.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:27.560
At least get the gentleman
out of the dirt.

01:20:27.562 --> 01:20:29.562
Dirt isn't the problem here.

01:20:29.564 --> 01:20:31.431
This man has a brain hemorrhage.

01:20:31.433 --> 01:20:34.168
His head wound
doesn't look significant.

01:20:34.170 --> 01:20:36.336
He indicated pain
at the front of his skull,

01:20:36.338 --> 01:20:38.771
which is the opposite side
of the head injury.

01:20:38.773 --> 01:20:40.574
Yes, but you're
leaping to conclusions.

01:20:40.576 --> 01:20:44.310
Stop wasting time and help me
move him to your motorcar!

01:20:44.312 --> 01:20:45.678
Carefully.

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.116
Let's go.

01:20:48.817 --> 01:20:50.851
Carefully.

01:20:50.853 --> 01:20:53.921
Get these people
out of here.

01:20:53.923 --> 01:20:55.888
Nice and level.

01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:57.626
Gently.

01:20:59.295 --> 01:21:02.863
You, boy,
get me my medical case now.

01:21:02.865 --> 01:21:04.664
Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc.

01:21:07.769 --> 01:21:09.368
If we don't relieve
the pressure on the brain,

01:21:09.370 --> 01:21:10.503
we might lose him.

01:21:10.505 --> 01:21:12.573
No. Compound fracture is first.

01:21:12.575 --> 01:21:14.477
- Before he comes to.
- Absolutely not!

01:21:16.778 --> 01:21:17.613
Craniotomy first.

01:21:21.317 --> 01:21:23.784
What? You're gonna
drill into the man's head?

01:21:23.786 --> 01:21:24.918
That's primeval.

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:26.252
I should say so.

01:21:26.254 --> 01:21:27.520
Yeah.

01:21:27.522 --> 01:21:28.955
Where's that damn idiot kid

01:21:28.957 --> 01:21:30.990
with my medical case?

01:21:30.992 --> 01:21:33.293
Thank you!

01:21:35.296 --> 01:21:37.497
No, not you.
Don't touch me.

01:21:37.499 --> 01:21:40.633
Father, they're trying
to help you!

01:21:40.635 --> 01:21:42.569
Grace...

01:21:42.571 --> 01:21:46.306
Grace, I'm so sorry.

01:21:46.308 --> 01:21:48.574
Please. I love you. Go.

01:21:48.576 --> 01:21:51.477
You heard the man.
Please leave now.

01:21:51.479 --> 01:21:55.315
This man has every sign
of swelling on the brain.

01:21:55.317 --> 01:21:57.650
Continued head pain,
slurred speech.

01:21:57.652 --> 01:21:59.919
Look at his pupils,
for crying out loud!

01:21:59.921 --> 01:22:04.257
You will not
bore a hole in his head.

01:22:04.259 --> 01:22:06.560
My son is in good hands
with Dr. Reyes.

01:22:06.562 --> 01:22:08.261
That's right.

01:22:08.263 --> 01:22:09.962
We don't need a backwoods
country hick!

01:22:09.964 --> 01:22:13.569
Hallelujah. Now get your things
and get the hell out.

01:22:16.437 --> 01:22:18.471
Okay.

01:22:18.473 --> 01:22:22.275
I'll leave,
but under professional protest.

01:22:22.277 --> 01:22:24.377
Let's go.

01:22:24.379 --> 01:22:26.680
Okay, let's move him up now.
Let's go, let's go.

01:22:26.682 --> 01:22:28.448
No, you shouldn't
elevate his head!

01:22:29.785 --> 01:22:32.655
Out of here!
You get out.

01:22:33.921 --> 01:22:36.957
You, you quack.

01:22:36.959 --> 01:22:37.994
Get out!

01:22:41.429 --> 01:22:42.762
Quack.

01:22:42.764 --> 01:22:43.963
Let's go, Jo.

01:22:43.965 --> 01:22:46.365
We'll be outside
if you need us.

01:22:46.367 --> 01:22:49.371
We're fine now.
Let's get to his leg.

01:23:17.366 --> 01:23:19.869
He's gone.

01:23:30.978 --> 01:23:33.547
What happened?

01:23:33.549 --> 01:23:38.385
Dr. Reyes said
it was internal injury.

01:23:38.387 --> 01:23:39.755
Lying fool.

01:23:52.134 --> 01:23:54.735
Hmm.

01:23:54.737 --> 01:23:58.038
So sorry for your loss, madam.

01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:01.074
If only I'd been first
at the scene...

01:24:01.076 --> 01:24:03.546
Not your fault, Doctor.

01:24:07.582 --> 01:24:10.050
Well, I should give you
some time alone with him.

01:24:10.052 --> 01:24:11.083
Sorry.

01:24:13.054 --> 01:24:15.087
Grace.

01:24:15.089 --> 01:24:16.890
Grace?

01:24:16.892 --> 01:24:19.092
You need to go inside now.

01:24:19.094 --> 01:24:21.461
Grace!

01:24:21.463 --> 01:24:23.398
We really must.

01:24:36.978 --> 01:24:39.078
Dr. Reyes.

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:41.614
Um...

01:24:41.616 --> 01:24:43.550
about the wedding.

01:24:43.552 --> 01:24:45.886
Yes.

01:24:45.888 --> 01:24:48.821
Well, I guess
we should reschedule.

01:24:48.823 --> 01:24:52.758
Heavens no. I...

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:56.797
I think we should
make it even sooner now.

01:24:56.799 --> 01:24:59.833
We need a man
about the house,

01:24:59.835 --> 01:25:03.203
and someone
to run the business.

01:25:07.608 --> 01:25:10.843
Lovey, you are
the light of good news

01:25:10.845 --> 01:25:13.849
in the midst of
such dark sorrow.

01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:22.592
Helen, Mrs. Danielson's asked
to move up the wedding date.

01:25:24.793 --> 01:25:27.194
Grace will need your help now
more than ever.

01:25:27.196 --> 01:25:29.562
Of course, Father,

01:25:29.564 --> 01:25:32.966
but I think there's something
you both should see right now.

01:25:32.968 --> 01:25:34.935
Grace...

01:25:34.937 --> 01:25:37.473
we need to go inside now.

01:25:39.707 --> 01:25:41.777
What is going on out here?

01:25:43.045 --> 01:25:44.944
Grace, come inside.

01:25:44.946 --> 01:25:46.882
You're not well.

01:25:53.789 --> 01:25:56.192
I'm staying with Jo.

01:25:57.793 --> 01:26:00.196
Get your hands off her!

01:26:05.701 --> 01:26:08.735
Mrs. Danielson...

01:26:08.737 --> 01:26:10.736
my intentions are honorable.

01:26:10.738 --> 01:26:12.775
Honorable?

01:26:15.210 --> 01:26:16.045
Honorable?

01:26:18.013 --> 01:26:21.584
Get away from
Dr. Reyes' fiancée.

01:26:23.951 --> 01:26:26.151
You don't even have a last name.

01:26:26.153 --> 01:26:29.055
Now, just a second,
Mrs. Danielson.

01:26:29.057 --> 01:26:30.724
- Jo's trying to do the right thing.
- Shut up!

01:26:30.726 --> 01:26:32.892
This has nothing to do with you.

01:26:32.894 --> 01:26:36.029
I don't wanna marry him.
I wanna be with Jo.

01:26:36.031 --> 01:26:40.199
You will never talk
like that again

01:26:40.201 --> 01:26:42.002
in front of your future husband.

01:26:42.004 --> 01:26:42.905
Do you hear me?

01:26:51.946 --> 01:26:53.882
Long walk home.

01:27:00.955 --> 01:27:04.791
It seems you have
some competition, Father.

01:27:04.793 --> 01:27:08.895
I'll take care of it.
You just keep an eye on Grace.

01:27:08.897 --> 01:27:12.599
I need to go to Hilo
first thing in the morning to...

01:27:12.601 --> 01:27:15.901
converse with Ford about...

01:27:15.903 --> 01:27:17.839
the back payments.

01:27:19.674 --> 01:27:22.708
We can't have our vehicle
being repossessed

01:27:22.710 --> 01:27:24.280
on my wedding day.

01:27:30.585 --> 01:27:33.522
Do you actually care
for this one, Father?

01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:38.057
It doesn't matter.

01:27:38.059 --> 01:27:40.729
No, I suppose not.

01:28:18.834 --> 01:28:21.301
Do you, um...

01:28:21.303 --> 01:28:22.972
Do you think
we could've saved him?

01:28:24.372 --> 01:28:26.306
Yes, I think so.

01:28:26.308 --> 01:28:29.309
- I guess it doesn't matter now.
- It does matter!

01:28:29.311 --> 01:28:32.846
'Cause you did good.

01:28:32.848 --> 01:28:35.280
You stayed cool, and you
stayed focused under pressure,

01:28:35.282 --> 01:28:37.719
and I'm proud of you.

01:28:40.821 --> 01:28:43.922
And you proved to me that...

01:28:43.924 --> 01:28:46.594
you are ready
to assist me in doctoring.

01:28:50.665 --> 01:28:53.101
Yeah, but Grace
lost her father.

01:28:56.138 --> 01:28:58.137
You can't let her lose you.

01:28:58.139 --> 01:29:00.673
Do whatever it takes,

01:29:00.675 --> 01:29:03.243
but you can't let that girl go.

01:29:03.245 --> 01:29:06.779
What chance do I really have?

01:29:06.781 --> 01:29:09.716
You heard what
Mrs. Danielson said.

01:29:09.718 --> 01:29:11.918
I don't even have a last name.

01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:15.454
Mrs. Danielson.

01:29:15.456 --> 01:29:19.693
You can't allow Mrs. Danielson
to define who you are.

01:29:19.695 --> 01:29:23.262
Doc, I'm an illegitimate
bastard.

01:29:23.264 --> 01:29:25.330
That is not true!
You're my son!

01:29:25.332 --> 01:29:26.865
Maybe not legally,

01:29:26.867 --> 01:29:28.267
but you'll always be
a better man

01:29:28.269 --> 01:29:31.837
than that pompous
poser of a doctor.

01:29:31.839 --> 01:29:33.642
Believe that!

01:29:38.412 --> 01:29:40.683
Speak of the devil himself.

01:29:49.256 --> 01:29:52.161
What is that idiot
trying to prove now?

01:30:02.103 --> 01:30:03.738
Look out!

01:30:15.116 --> 01:30:16.117
Doc?

01:30:21.122 --> 01:30:24.490
- What should I do?
- Jo!

01:30:25.826 --> 01:30:27.927
I'm gonna run and get help.

01:30:27.929 --> 01:30:29.031
No.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.167
Not even you're that fast, Jo.

01:30:43.844 --> 01:30:45.914
No, no, no.

01:31:10.472 --> 01:31:12.041
You killed Doc.

01:31:14.276 --> 01:31:16.412
You murderer!

01:31:27.955 --> 01:31:32.891
As the only licensed doctor
on this side of the island,

01:31:32.893 --> 01:31:36.296
my official report
will conclude...

01:31:36.298 --> 01:31:39.231
this man was drunk,

01:31:39.233 --> 01:31:42.034
he fell, he hit his head
on a rock.

01:31:42.036 --> 01:31:43.569
No witnesses.

01:31:43.571 --> 01:31:47.172
As you hope to live,

01:31:47.174 --> 01:31:49.976
you will leave this town,

01:31:49.978 --> 01:31:51.914
never to return.

01:31:53.948 --> 01:31:56.818
Or you will be next.

01:32:33.021 --> 01:32:35.224
Doc!

01:33:38.687 --> 01:33:41.988
<i>Even when
months and days are long,</i>

01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:44.023
<i>life is short.</i>

01:33:44.025 --> 01:33:48.627
<i>We all mourned the death
of Mr. Danielson and Doc</i>

01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:50.365
<i>in our own way.</i>

01:35:44.144 --> 01:35:47.646
Oh, I love this place.

01:35:47.648 --> 01:35:50.749
Grace, when the good doctor
arrives,

01:35:50.751 --> 01:35:52.784
please be cheerful.

01:35:52.786 --> 01:35:55.454
You do remember how
to be cheerful, don't you?

01:35:55.456 --> 01:35:57.392
Of course she does.

01:36:28.156 --> 01:36:29.224
Jo?

01:36:39.534 --> 01:36:40.835
So you're the elusive Jo.

01:36:43.138 --> 01:36:45.337
Charles Gray, Attorney at Law.

01:36:45.339 --> 01:36:47.409
Trust me when I say
this is a miracle.

01:37:01.889 --> 01:37:02.624
Grace.

01:37:25.812 --> 01:37:29.515
Miss Hanabusa, please,
go check on the flowers.

01:37:29.517 --> 01:37:31.452
I will tend to Grace.

01:38:29.978 --> 01:38:30.712
Coming through!

01:38:41.789 --> 01:38:42.890
Yahoo!

01:38:56.970 --> 01:38:58.573
What?

01:39:18.425 --> 01:39:19.594
Damn kid.

01:39:28.635 --> 01:39:29.604
Damn!

01:39:40.915 --> 01:39:43.752
My father's motorcar
should arrive any minute now.

01:39:56.964 --> 01:39:57.966
There he is.

01:40:08.009 --> 01:40:10.709
Remember what
your grandmother said.

01:40:10.711 --> 01:40:12.647
Remember to smile.

01:40:14.848 --> 01:40:18.083
Miss Grace,
someone else is coming.

01:40:18.085 --> 01:40:20.054
What do you mean,
someone else is coming?

01:40:31.698 --> 01:40:32.733
Grace!

01:41:18.146 --> 01:41:20.581
Run, Jo, run.

01:41:45.505 --> 01:41:46.741
Damn it.

01:42:09.129 --> 01:42:09.930
Look out!

01:42:29.116 --> 01:42:31.150
You, you...

01:42:31.152 --> 01:42:33.552
You've ruined all this.

01:42:33.554 --> 01:42:35.154
- Grandmother, please.
- You!

01:42:35.156 --> 01:42:37.989
What right have you
to even be here?

01:42:37.991 --> 01:42:39.927
Who the hell
do you think you are?

01:42:42.062 --> 01:42:45.096
Jo Lawrence.

01:42:45.098 --> 01:42:47.902
I'm the legally adopted son
of Dr. Elias Lawrence.

01:42:53.808 --> 01:42:55.841
Mrs. Danielson!

01:42:55.843 --> 01:42:57.075
Please.

01:42:57.077 --> 01:43:01.747
Mrs. Danielson, I have a name,

01:43:01.749 --> 01:43:03.751
and I am of legal standing.

01:43:07.088 --> 01:43:09.922
I've come here today to...

01:43:09.924 --> 01:43:12.891
ask for your hand in marriage.

01:43:12.893 --> 01:43:15.194
Even though Jo
is now entitled,

01:43:15.196 --> 01:43:17.799
Miss. Danielson has not yet
come of age to be married.

01:43:20.902 --> 01:43:22.635
Consent from a legal guardian
is required.

01:43:22.637 --> 01:43:25.003
Yeah, mm-hmm.

01:43:25.005 --> 01:43:27.672
Consent is given.

01:43:27.674 --> 01:43:28.873
What?

01:43:28.875 --> 01:43:31.743
As her acting legal guardian

01:43:31.745 --> 01:43:35.713
looking after her best interest,

01:43:35.715 --> 01:43:38.918
I accept the proposal
on behalf of Miss Grace.

01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:42.221
You'll do no such thing!

01:43:42.223 --> 01:43:44.789
That is if she wishes to accept.

01:43:46.326 --> 01:43:47.860
No!

01:43:47.862 --> 01:43:50.328
No, she's mine.

01:43:54.067 --> 01:43:57.302
The house and the plantation...

01:43:57.304 --> 01:43:58.874
are mine.

01:44:00.575 --> 01:44:02.574
We're gonna be married,
sweetheart.

01:44:02.576 --> 01:44:05.077
We had an agreement.

01:44:05.079 --> 01:44:06.811
Yeah. Danielson.

01:44:06.813 --> 01:44:08.980
The Danielson family is,

01:44:08.982 --> 01:44:10.783

is the house,

01:44:19.259 --> 01:44:21.327
and that is in Grace's name.

01:44:21.329 --> 01:44:23.662

01:44:40.982 --> 01:44:43.181
Father! Father!

01:44:43.183 --> 01:44:45.219

were subdivided</i>

01:45:56.322 --> 01:45:58.356

01:46:16.210 --> 01:46:17.943
<i>I remained in the service</i>

01:46:17.945 --> 01:46:20.846

01:46:20.848 --> 01:46:23.449
