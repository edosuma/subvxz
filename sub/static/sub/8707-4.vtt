14:26.788 --> 14:30.925
Well, we'll keep her
on life support.

14:30.959 --> 14:33.628
That's...
that's what she wanted.

14:36.431 --> 14:41.636
Yes. Mom and I talked about it
after my experience in a coma.

14:43.805 --> 14:46.107
She said that she wanted us
to do everything

14:46.141 --> 14:47.942
that we could to keep her alive.

14:47.976 --> 14:52.747
Her advance directive is
on the Living Will Registry.

14:52.781 --> 14:55.683
Yes.

14:55.717 --> 14:57.385
(sighs)

15:00.989 --> 15:02.256
(monitor beeping,
air pumping steadily)

15:02.291 --> 15:04.425
(sighs)

15:04.459 --> 15:06.093
MULDER:
Clean?

15:06.128 --> 15:08.296
So clean.
There's nothing here.

15:08.330 --> 15:10.431
You can confirm that
there's no presence of

15:10.465 --> 15:11.632
any pathogenic agents?

15:11.667 --> 15:12.733
No, Mulder.

15:12.768 --> 15:14.068
I mean, there's nothing.

15:14.102 --> 15:15.803
Something's there.

15:15.838 --> 15:18.940
Some material appears apparent,
but it's also not there.

15:18.974 --> 15:21.075
I used backscattered
electron imaging to separate

15:21.110 --> 15:23.578
and identify inorganic particles
from organic materials,

15:23.612 --> 15:25.480
and I found neither.

15:25.514 --> 15:27.949
There's no organic material
on this Band-Aid,

15:27.983 --> 15:30.751
but there's no inorganic
material either.

15:30.786 --> 15:32.487
It's not alive.

15:32.521 --> 15:33.821
It's not dead.

15:40.829 --> 15:42.797
(monitor beeping,
air pumping steadily)

15:42.831 --> 15:46.234
Nurse? Is it wise
to administer

15:46.268 --> 15:49.170
a hypertonic saline
to a cardiac arrest patient?

15:49.204 --> 15:51.839
Agent Scully, we had to confirm
your mother's advance directive,

15:51.874 --> 15:54.475
and it indicates
that she not be resuscitated

15:54.510 --> 15:56.944
if unconscious or requires
artificial respiration.

15:56.979 --> 15:58.846
She amended it last year.

15:58.881 --> 16:01.883
It's signed and witnessed by
two retired naval officers.

16:05.554 --> 16:08.022
(labored breathing)

16:14.863 --> 16:17.231
Let's see what
we got here.

16:21.970 --> 16:23.337
Whew!

16:23.372 --> 16:25.139
- This one's so big.
- Yeah.

16:25.174 --> 16:27.475
This is new territory.
It's not like him.

16:27.509 --> 16:29.177
We should go
to Sotheby's on this.

16:29.211 --> 16:31.679
Never knew you could make so
much money off the homeless.

16:31.713 --> 16:34.015
- (laughs)
- I'll call our usual collectors.

16:34.049 --> 16:35.983
- Put that away.
- Okay.

16:37.019 --> 16:38.820
I got it.

16:38.854 --> 16:40.555
Let's go, buddy.

16:40.589 --> 16:41.823
(sighs)

16:43.759 --> 16:45.760
All right.

16:54.369 --> 16:56.370
(sighs)

16:57.473 --> 16:59.407
(dialing)

16:59.441 --> 17:01.876
(wheels squeaking)

17:03.912 --> 17:05.713
(flies buzzing)

17:20.662 --> 17:22.663
Hey.

17:28.569 --> 17:31.439
You input that new guy's number
we met from last week?

17:31.473 --> 17:33.474
(phone chimes)

17:35.144 --> 17:36.377
(chuckles)

17:36.412 --> 17:37.779
The waitress from the bar?

17:37.813 --> 17:40.214
(singsongy):
She's got a friend.

17:42.618 --> 17:44.552
What are you doing?

17:44.586 --> 17:46.454
Why'd you turn it around, man?

17:46.488 --> 17:48.956
Those slats will
mess up the paint.

17:53.862 --> 17:55.797
Dude, what are you doing?

18:01.070 --> 18:04.038
(gasping)

18:04.073 --> 18:05.273
(grunts)

18:12.181 --> 18:14.182
(doors creak, thud)

18:17.052 --> 18:20.054
(garbage truck
clattering, rumbling)

18:25.674 --> 18:29.310
_

18:31.946 --> 18:34.981
(monitor beeping,
air pumping steadily)

18:35.016 --> 18:36.816
We have to extubate her.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.920
It's not necessarily
termination,

18:40.955 --> 18:44.591
but we not only
have to honor the law, Dana,

18:44.625 --> 18:46.793
we also have to respect
your mother's wishes.

18:47.828 --> 18:49.829
(phone vibrating)

18:59.774 --> 19:01.307
(phone beeps)

19:01.342 --> 19:02.742
Yeah.

19:02.777 --> 19:04.477
MULDER:
I'm here.

19:10.685 --> 19:12.118
(bus brakes squeak)

19:12.153 --> 19:13.553
LANDRY:
All right!

19:13.588 --> 19:15.689
Time to go to your new home.

19:15.723 --> 19:17.657
- Everyone on the bus.
HUFF: - Excuse me.

19:17.692 --> 19:19.025
MAN: - Let's go.
LANDRY: - Oh.

19:19.060 --> 19:21.461
This is an injunction against
this operation, Landry.

19:21.495 --> 19:23.697
If any of these buses show
up at Franklin Hospital,

19:23.731 --> 19:26.266
they'll be turned away by
Bucks County sheriffs.

19:32.373 --> 19:34.307
MULDER: There was
some artwork displayed

19:34.342 --> 19:36.309
outside Cutler's office
after the murder.

19:36.344 --> 19:38.245
It was of a figure

19:38.279 --> 19:40.347
the people on the street
believes defends them.

19:40.381 --> 19:42.949
The street artist
that made the artwork

19:42.984 --> 19:45.418
goes by the name "Trashman" --
no one knows his real name.

19:45.453 --> 19:48.388
Stays anonymous.
No one's ever seen him.

19:48.422 --> 19:50.523
I suspect the subject may be
a mission-oriented killer

19:50.558 --> 19:52.425
who believes
he's helping the homeless

19:52.460 --> 19:55.862
by eliminating those involved
with the relocation.

19:57.798 --> 19:59.933
And I would stay,

19:59.967 --> 20:03.403
but I suspect
the subject will kill again.

20:05.239 --> 20:09.709
She asked for Charlie before
she fell into the coma.

20:09.744 --> 20:12.178
- Your brother?
- Yeah.

20:12.213 --> 20:15.015
Just him.
Not Bill or me or...

20:15.049 --> 20:16.783
I don't even know
where he is.

20:16.817 --> 20:19.886
He hasn't bothered with her
or with us for years.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.821
Why would she do that?

20:21.856 --> 20:24.324
And why would she
change her living will

20:24.358 --> 20:26.192
without talking to me?

20:27.862 --> 20:30.864
And what's this? Oh.

20:30.898 --> 20:33.166
I've never seen
her wear it.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.669
The-the date has
no significance.

20:35.703 --> 20:37.537
It's not any of
our birthdays.

20:37.572 --> 20:41.341
It's not dad's
death or Melissa's.

20:41.375 --> 20:44.010
I mean, what is it
about that quarter

20:44.045 --> 20:47.547
that she would frame it
to put it around her neck?

20:49.550 --> 20:51.051
DOCTOR:
Are you ready to extubate?

20:51.085 --> 20:52.552
WOMAN:
Yes, Doctor.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.521
DOCTOR: - You have a stent on hand?
WOMAN: - Removing the tube.

21:03.556 --> 21:05.565
On her next exhale.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.601
MAN:
Ready?

21:13.407 --> 21:17.544
I don't care about the big
questions right now, Mulder.

21:17.578 --> 21:21.615
I just want one more chance
to ask my mom a few little ones.

we ever come across
the ability to just...

24:16.223 --> 24:18.425
wish someone back to life?

24:18.459 --> 24:20.827
I invented it.

24:20.861 --> 24:24.931
When you were in
the hospital,

24:24.965 --> 24:26.966
like this.

You're a dark wizard, Mulder.

What else is new?
(laughs)

24:38.279 --> 24:40.280
(phone vibrating)

24:45.419 --> 24:48.355
Hello?

24:48.389 --> 24:50.623
Charlie.

24:50.658 --> 24:52.392
Did Bill call you?

24:52.426 --> 24:54.294
Yeah. Um...

24:54.328 --> 24:56.096
Mom asked for you.

24:56.130 --> 24:57.897
Charlie, can you
just say something

24:57.932 --> 25:00.467
to her, please?

25:00.501 --> 25:02.802
Just anything. I don't know.

25:02.837 --> 25:04.537
Just...
(sighs)

25:04.572 --> 25:06.306
Do what I can't do.

25:08.376 --> 25:11.511
Bring her back to us.

25:11.545 --> 25:12.812
Okay.

25:12.847 --> 25:15.348
I'll put it on speakerphone.

25:16.917 --> 25:18.652
(phone beeps)

25:18.686 --> 25:20.286
I've got Charlie here.

25:20.321 --> 25:22.289
He's on the phone.

25:22.323 --> 25:24.491
I know you can hear him.

25:24.525 --> 25:26.793
CHARLIE:
Mom? It's me.

25:26.827 --> 25:28.461
It's Charlie.

25:28.496 --> 25:30.230
I heard you were
asking for me, so...

25:30.264 --> 25:32.332
here I am, for once.

25:32.366 --> 25:34.467
What do you want to know?

25:34.502 --> 25:36.703
What's the big mystery?

25:36.737 --> 25:38.138
Anything? Any reaction?

25:38.172 --> 25:39.439
Well, her pulse
rate quickened,

25:39.473 --> 25:41.808
but I didn't see her move.

25:47.715 --> 25:48.815
Mom?

25:48.849 --> 25:51.384
She just
opened her eyes.

25:51.419 --> 25:52.686
Do you know where you are?

25:52.720 --> 25:53.987
Do you know your name?

26:01.896 --> 26:05.131
My son...

26:05.166 --> 26:08.201
is named William, too.

26:15.209 --> 26:16.609
Mom? Mom.

26:16.644 --> 26:18.712
- Mom. Mom, it's Dana.
- (monitor beeping rapidly)

26:18.746 --> 26:20.580
- Mom, I'm here. I'm here.
- (monitor flatlining)

26:20.614 --> 26:22.415
Come back to us.
Mom? Mom?

26:22.450 --> 26:24.584
CHARLIE:
Dana? Dana?

26:24.618 --> 26:25.685
Mom.

26:25.720 --> 26:27.287
What's going on?

26:27.321 --> 26:29.723
(crying)

26:51.989 --> 26:53.911
No! You get that
out of here!

26:54.023 --> 26:55.806
- Get that out of here!
- Scully! Scully!

26:55.878 --> 26:58.082
No. Margaret's an organ donor.

26:58.368 --> 26:59.423
They need her right away.

27:01.371 --> 27:03.005
Let her go.

27:03.039 --> 27:05.040
(crying)

27:14.384 --> 27:18.120
Her last words to us...
(sniffles)

27:18.155 --> 27:20.656
were about our child.

27:22.659 --> 27:26.061
Her grandchild.

27:26.096 --> 27:28.731
That we gave away.

27:32.235 --> 27:34.737
Why did she say that?

27:37.007 --> 27:40.042
Why did she have to say that?

27:42.079 --> 27:44.013
(crying)

27:52.956 --> 27:54.857
(sniffles)

27:54.891 --> 27:56.258
Mulder, let's drive
to Philadelphia.

27:56.293 --> 27:57.760
- I need to work.
- No. No, no, no.

27:57.794 --> 27:59.862
- Yes. Right now.
- No, I get it, Scully, I do.

27:59.896 --> 28:01.197
- But not right now.
- Mulder, right now.

28:01.231 --> 28:03.065
I need to work right now.

28:16.646 --> 28:18.647
MAN: I broke down the paint
samples you chipped away

28:18.682 --> 28:20.316
from the Trashman's signature
and analyzed it

28:20.350 --> 28:22.084
with vibrational spectography.

28:22.118 --> 28:23.819
It defines binders,
pigments and additives

28:23.853 --> 28:25.287
that are used in spray paint.

28:25.321 --> 28:27.056
The binder present
in this breakdown

Magic!

32:08.482 --> 32:10.182

32:10.217 --> 32:12.351
because it piles up
in the landfill.

32:12.385 --> 32:14.587
And the plastics leak toxins

32:14.621 --> 32:16.822
into the water

I did my part.

32:28.335 --> 32:29.869
By killing Joseph Cutler
and Nancy Huff

32:29.903 --> 32:31.770
and those two art thieves?

32:31.805 --> 32:33.739
Nah, I was just trying to give
those people a voice

32:33.774 --> 32:36.942
the only way I know how--
through art.

32:36.977 --> 32:38.677
Not violence.

32:38.712 --> 32:41.046
Something I can put around town,
so they wouldn't be forgotten.

looked down on
the Lawn Gnome Suburban Lady.

Well, why'd you put up
the art after the fact?

32:48.822 --> 32:50.356
The-the morning
of Cutler's murder?

32:50.390 --> 32:51.624
I didn't.

32:51.658 --> 32:53.926
That-that... that wasn't me.

32:53.960 --> 32:55.227
I only thought him up.

32:55.262 --> 32:57.830
You know?

33:03.303 --> 33:05.504
You saw those things
in the hall.

33:05.539 --> 33:07.706
- Yeah.
- I made them.

33:07.741 --> 33:10.075
I didn't mean to,
but I made 'em.

33:10.110 --> 33:11.710
They'll go away, eventually.

33:11.745 --> 33:14.113
They're fading.

33:14.147 --> 33:16.582
But the Band-Aid Nose Man...

33:18.318 --> 33:20.052
he's different.

33:23.557 --> 33:25.191
Tibetan Buddhists
would call him a Tulpa.

33:25.225 --> 33:27.226
A thought form

33:27.260 --> 33:30.529
using mind and energy to will
a consciousness into existence.

33:30.564 --> 33:33.666
Tulpa is a 1929
Theosophist mistranslation

33:33.700 --> 33:35.634
of the Tibetan
word "tulku,"

33:35.669 --> 33:37.103
meaning "a
manifestation body."

33:37.137 --> 33:38.437
There is no idea

33:38.472 --> 33:39.905
in Tibetan Buddhism

33:39.940 --> 33:42.141
of a thought form
or thought as form.

33:42.175 --> 33:43.609
And a... and a
realized tulku

33:43.643 --> 33:45.878
would never harm anyone,
let alone kill.

33:45.912 --> 33:47.947
Okay. But I'm telling you.

33:47.981 --> 33:49.615
I spend a lot of energy
in my art.

33:49.649 --> 33:51.684
I, uh, meditated on it.

33:51.718 --> 33:53.719
I willed it.

33:56.289 --> 33:59.091
<i>What I wanted him to look like,</i>

33:59.126 --> 34:00.326
<i>what I wanted him to be,</i>

34:00.360 --> 34:02.528

34:09.436 --> 34:10.770

34:15.342 --> 34:18.210

what he wanted to be.</i>

34:18.245 --> 34:21.580
All we do
is hold the pencil.

34:21.614 --> 34:24.650
All we do is
hold the clay.

34:24.684 --> 34:27.219
<i>I think there must be spirits</i>

34:27.254 --> 34:30.489
<i>and souls
floating all around us.</i>

34:30.524 --> 34:31.924

34:31.958 --> 34:36.329
real hard

34:36.362 --> 34:38.431
<i>they come to you.</i>

34:38.465 --> 34:40.399
What are you gonna call him?

34:40.434 --> 34:42.234
William.

34:42.268 --> 34:44.670
And then they become
alive with a life

34:44.705 --> 34:47.206
of their own.

34:49.309 --> 34:52.678

34:52.713 --> 34:54.880

35:05.792 --> 35:07.860

in my dreams.

35:07.894 --> 35:09.862
From some
other place, yeah?

35:09.896 --> 35:12.331
But now it's alive
and it's out there.

35:12.366 --> 35:15.267
Down to the Band-Aid I used
to hold the clay in place.

35:15.302 --> 35:17.203
Who would copy this?

35:17.237 --> 35:18.938
And did you smell it?

35:18.972 --> 35:20.606
It smells like
nothing on this Earth.

35:20.641 --> 35:21.874
It has its own life.

35:21.908 --> 35:24.210
Does what it wants.

35:24.244 --> 35:26.145
I just wanted to scare 'em,

35:26.179 --> 35:28.114
scare anyone that took dignity
away from the homeless.

35:28.148 --> 35:30.416
That's where the violent idea
popped in my head.

35:30.450 --> 35:32.385
It was just an emotion
that ran through my head.

35:32.419 --> 35:34.854
An idea is dangerous,
even a small one.

35:34.888 --> 35:37.523
But now he uses
that violent idea.

35:37.557 --> 35:40.826
He thinks that is
what he is supposed to do.

35:40.861 --> 35:42.028
You are responsible.

35:44.164 --> 35:46.799
If you made the problem,

35:46.833 --> 35:50.002
if it was your idea...

35:50.037 --> 35:52.371
then you're responsible.

35:52.406 --> 35:54.507
You put it
out of sight,

35:54.541 --> 35:58.210
so that it wouldn't be
your problem.

35:58.245 --> 36:02.181
But you're just as bad
as the people that you hate.

36:05.819 --> 36:07.987
If what you believe is possible,
the last person

36:08.021 --> 36:10.923
involved in the relocation
would be Landry.

36:10.958 --> 36:12.425
