Well, then, no chores, no allowance.

it can happen to anyone.

14:00.940 --> 14:03.170
- I'm going for a corn dog. You want one?
- Yes.

14:03.275 --> 14:06.244
But first, there's a little matter
of the carny code.

14:06.345 --> 14:11.510
Cooder, Spud, get off that hog.
You're coming to stay at our house.

Oh, it won't be long. Once their résumé
gets out, they'll have all kinds of offers.

So, Mr. Cooder, how long have you been
