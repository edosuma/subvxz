WEBVTT

00:06.407 --> 00:08.909
Anything?
WILLOW:
Ah!

00:08.942 --> 00:11.044
"Introduction
to the Modern Novel.

00:11.079 --> 00:13.846
A survey study
of 20th century novelists."

00:13.881 --> 00:15.749
Open to freshmen.
You might like that.

00:15.782 --> 00:18.986
Introduction
to the Modern Novel?

00:19.018 --> 00:22.422
I'm guessing I'd probably have
to read the modern novel.

00:22.455 --> 00:25.092
Maybe more than one.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.926
I like books...

00:26.960 --> 00:30.763
I just don't want
to take on too much.

00:30.797 --> 00:33.567
Do they have an Introduction
to the Modern Blurb?

00:34.868 --> 00:36.404
Oh! "Short Story."

00:36.436 --> 00:37.905
Well, that's good.
Oh.

00:37.938 --> 00:39.773
No, it conflicts with psych.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.542
Maybe I shouldn't take psych.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.944
You got to. It's fun,

00:43.976 --> 00:46.347
a-and you can use it
as your science requirement.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.682
Anyway, Professor Walsh
is supposed to be great.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.917
She's like world-renowned.

00:50.951 --> 00:53.920
How do you get to be renowned?

00:53.954 --> 00:57.290
I mean, like, do you have
to be "nowned" first?

00:57.325 --> 01:01.962
Yes, first, there's the
painful "nowning" process. Wait!

01:01.994 --> 01:04.031
"Images of Pop Culture."

01:04.063 --> 01:07.100
This is good.
They-they watch movies,

01:07.135 --> 01:10.138
TV shows, even commercials.

01:10.170 --> 01:13.240
For credit?
(laughs)
Isn't college cool?

01:13.274 --> 01:15.942
How did I miss that one?

01:15.975 --> 01:18.545
Well, you did sort of
wait till the last minute

01:18.579 --> 01:20.046
with your course selection.

01:20.079 --> 01:24.817
Sorry, Miss "I chose
my major in play group."

01:24.852 --> 01:27.388
That's an exaggeration.

01:27.420 --> 01:31.424
I just, you know, think
it's good to be prepared.

01:31.459 --> 01:34.495
Don't want to be
caught unawares.

01:34.527 --> 01:36.129
Well, I've been busy.

01:36.164 --> 01:38.498
It's been a very
slay-heavy summer.

01:38.531 --> 01:40.734
Just haven't had
a whole lot of time

01:40.768 --> 01:43.804
to think about life
at UC Sunnydale.

01:43.837 --> 01:46.274
It's exciting,
though, isn't it?

01:46.307 --> 01:48.176
Yeah.

01:48.209 --> 01:51.010
It's gonna be
an adjustment.
Yeah.

01:51.043 --> 01:52.680
It's, like,
five miles away.

01:52.712 --> 01:55.915
(chuckles)
Just uncharted territory.

01:55.948 --> 01:58.252
Giles said I have to be
secret-identity gal again.

01:58.286 --> 01:59.753
That makes sense.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.022
It's gonna be
tough, though.

02:02.055 --> 02:04.090
With a roommate.
WILLOW:
Yeah.

02:04.123 --> 02:06.760
I'm psyched about
college, definitely.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.027
I just

02:09.062 --> 02:10.531
need to figure out how
it's gonna work with my

02:10.562 --> 02:13.133
extracurricular activities.

02:13.167 --> 02:16.503
I just can't let it
take the edge off my slaying.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.938
I got to stay sharp.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.175
(rustling)
(sighs)

02:21.209 --> 02:25.078
Is this guy ever
gonna wake up?

02:27.146 --> 02:30.283
(wolf howling)

02:30.318 --> 02:32.520
*

03:27.206 --> 03:30.311
(indistinct crowd chatter)

03:33.413 --> 03:35.549
* Sometimes

03:35.582 --> 03:38.686
* In the back of my mind...

03:38.718 --> 03:41.389
WOMAN:
Freshmen!

03:41.421 --> 03:43.591
We're doing this
by folder color!

03:43.623 --> 03:46.759
If you're not holding on
to a yellow folder,

03:46.793 --> 03:48.396
you're in the wrong group.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.730
You belong up by Wiesman Hall.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.099
(Woman 2 shouts indistinctly)

03:53.133 --> 03:55.802
WOMAN 2:
Got to hear us!

03:55.836 --> 03:57.405
Not gonna take it.

03:57.437 --> 04:00.039
Don't take it lying down.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.974
What do we want?
(overlapping shouting))

04:02.008 --> 04:03.242
When do we want it?

04:03.276 --> 04:04.978
CROWD:
Now!
Not gonna take it.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.280
CROWD:
No!

04:06.313 --> 04:09.282
(indistinct shouting)

04:09.317 --> 04:10.884
WOMAN 2:
That's right.
Don't forget us!

04:10.918 --> 04:12.719
* Freshmen coming through!

04:12.752 --> 04:16.824
(man chanting indistinctly)

04:16.856 --> 04:18.625
Rally tomorrow night.

04:18.658 --> 04:20.427
We have to let the
administration know how we feel.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.894
Yeah. Right.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.497
WOMAN:
Have you accepted

04:23.531 --> 04:25.264
Jesus Christ
as your personal savior?

04:25.298 --> 04:26.667
Uh, you know, I meant to,

04:26.699 --> 04:28.735
and-and then I just
got really busy.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.771
Party Thursday
at Alpha Delt.

04:30.803 --> 04:32.939
Got to be there. Free
Jell-O shots for freshman women.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.841
Do-do you guys know where...
Hey, party at Alpha Delt.

04:34.875 --> 04:37.177
...Wiesman Hall is?

04:39.346 --> 04:42.449
(bell plays tune)

04:42.483 --> 04:44.351
Buffy. Hey!

04:44.384 --> 04:46.019
Oh, boy, am I
glad to see you.

04:46.052 --> 04:48.788
Isn't this cool?
There's so much going on.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.824
Yeah. Almost, one
might say, too much.

04:51.858 --> 04:54.961
I got all my courses,
except for Modern Poetry.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.529
I had to switch
to Ethnomusicology,

04:56.564 --> 04:57.965
but that's cool.

04:57.997 --> 04:59.332
West African drumming.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.800
I think it's gonna
change everything.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.603
Have you met
your roommate yet?

05:02.636 --> 05:04.437
No.
Me, neither.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.838
I hope she's cool.

05:05.872 --> 05:07.341
I see you got
ticketed, too.

05:07.375 --> 05:10.009
Yes. I've heard about
five different issues,

05:10.043 --> 05:12.446
and I'm angry about each
and every one of them.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.281
What did you get?
Jell-O shots.

05:15.314 --> 05:17.184
I didn't get Jell-O shots.

05:17.216 --> 05:21.221
Oh, I'll trade you for
a "Take Back the Night."

05:21.254 --> 05:23.557
Are we heading anywhere
near Wiesman Hall?

05:23.591 --> 05:26.627
I still need to get
my I.D. card.
Oh, I got mine
this morning.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.995
The lines are really long now.
You should have gone early.

05:29.028 --> 05:33.401
Well, I hope that I learn from
this experience and that I grow.

05:33.433 --> 05:35.536
I'm being annoying,
aren't I?

05:35.569 --> 05:37.538
No. It's nice that
you're excited.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.305
It's just in high school,

05:39.338 --> 05:41.542
knowledge was
pretty much frowned upon.

05:41.574 --> 05:44.011
You really had to work
to learn anything.

05:44.043 --> 05:46.846
But here, the energy, the-the
collective intelligence--

05:46.879 --> 05:49.850
it's like this force,
thi-this penetrating force,

05:49.882 --> 05:53.220
and I can just feel
my mind opening up, you know,

05:53.252 --> 05:56.757
and letting this place
just thrust into

05:56.790 --> 05:59.526
and-and spurt knowledge into...

05:59.560 --> 06:01.228
That sentence ended up

06:01.261 --> 06:03.697
in a different place
than it started out in.

06:03.730 --> 06:07.033
I'm with you, though. I'm
all for spurty knowledge.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.937
I mean, it's just, it's
a little overwhelming.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.338
Don't you feel it?

06:11.370 --> 06:12.773
Well, I'm... (gasp)

06:12.805 --> 06:16.076
Ooh, boyfriend!
It's my on-campus boyfriend.

06:16.108 --> 06:17.778
Oh, no, I forgot
to pick mine up.

06:17.810 --> 06:19.947
Line's probably
really long now, too.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.348
How are you?

06:21.380 --> 06:23.451
Good. It's pretty much
a madhouse, a madhouse.

06:23.483 --> 06:25.117
I know. I was just saying that
to Willow.

06:25.151 --> 06:26.954
I mean,
it's just so overwhelming.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.387
Don't you feel completely

06:28.422 --> 06:30.189
disoriented?
Oz!

06:30.223 --> 06:33.593
Hey, Paul.
Finally matriculating with us.

06:33.627 --> 06:34.894
Very cool.

06:34.927 --> 06:36.430
Tell me you're playing
this week.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.098
Thursday night,
Alpha Delt.

06:38.130 --> 06:40.600
Ooh! I have that one.
I'm bringing
the wrecking crew.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.134
Jell-O shots.
Good.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.437
Do you know where they're

06:43.471 --> 06:45.404
distributing the work-study
applications?

06:45.439 --> 06:47.274
Back of Richmond Hall,
next to the auditorium.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.643
Thanks. See you, bro.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.644
Go get 'em.

06:51.678 --> 06:55.215
My band's played here a lot.
It's still all new.

06:55.247 --> 06:59.086
I don't know what the hell's
going on. Hey, Doug.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.088
Library.

07:01.120 --> 07:04.757
Ooh, library. Come on.

07:04.791 --> 07:08.995
It's too bad Giles couldn't be
librarian here. Be convenient.

07:09.028 --> 07:10.396
Well, he says he's enjoying

07:10.430 --> 07:11.899
being a gentleman of leisure.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.666
Gentleman of leisure?

07:13.701 --> 07:15.668
Isn't that just
British for unemployed?

07:15.702 --> 07:17.605
Uh-huh. He's a slacker now.

07:17.637 --> 07:20.908
Speaking of slack, you
heard anything from Xander?

07:20.940 --> 07:22.442
Not for a while.

07:22.475 --> 07:25.177
He's still on his cross-country,
see-America thing.

07:25.211 --> 07:26.779
He said he wasn't coming back

07:26.814 --> 07:28.815
until he'd driven
to all 50 states.

07:28.848 --> 07:31.584
Did you explain
about Hawaii?

07:31.619 --> 07:34.187
Well, he seemed
so determined.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.189
Well, I hope he
gets back soon.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.692
It'd be fun to have the whole
gang back together, you know,

07:38.725 --> 07:41.394
hang out in
the... library.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.130
Wow.

07:46.899 --> 07:49.401
Oh, my gosh,
isn't this amazing?

07:51.370 --> 07:53.807
It's... cozy.

07:53.841 --> 07:56.475
You know, I never wanted
to hurt Giles's feelings,

07:56.509 --> 07:58.512
but occult books aside,

07:58.545 --> 08:01.949
our old library just didn't
have the greatest selection.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.283
But this!

08:04.317 --> 08:06.153
Yeah, this is great, you know,

08:06.185 --> 08:09.889
if we ever need a place
for the Nuremberg Rallies.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.324
Ah, this is a real library.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.560
MAN:
Shh!

08:12.593 --> 08:15.461
See, we even
have to whisper.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.930
(whispering):
It like a whole new world.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.538
Here.
Oh, thanks.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.874
I can't wait till Mom gets
the bill for these books.

08:26.906 --> 08:28.641
I hope it's a funny aneurism.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.879
Introduction
 to Psychology.

08:31.911 --> 08:34.682
Oh, up there.
I'll get 'em.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.216
You know,
this store discriminates

08:36.249 --> 08:37.585
against short people.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.418
Oh, I think there's
a protest next week.

08:39.451 --> 08:40.754
Whoa. Oh!

08:40.788 --> 08:42.389
(groans)
Whoa.
Oh! Aah!

08:42.422 --> 08:44.423
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

08:44.456 --> 08:47.527
I'm okay. It's okay.

08:47.561 --> 08:50.230
Well, that was bracing.

08:50.263 --> 08:53.500
I'm so... The books
were just too high,

08:53.533 --> 08:56.168
and then, everything was bad.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.538
Let me give you a hand.

09:00.807 --> 09:03.677
Let's put a few
of these down here.

09:03.711 --> 09:06.379
So, uh, are you girls
taking Intro Psych,

09:06.413 --> 09:08.581
or do you just want me dead?

09:08.615 --> 09:10.683
Uh-huh. I mean, the first one.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.284
Well, you'll have
a lot of fun.

09:12.318 --> 09:14.788
Professor Walsh--
she's quite a character.

09:14.822 --> 09:17.890
You've taken it?
I'm a T.A. I'll be helping
the professor out.

09:17.924 --> 09:20.293
I'm sorry. I've forgotten my
manners in all the concussion.

09:20.326 --> 09:21.729
I'm Riley.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.730
Willow,
and this is my friend Buffy.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.432
It's nice to meet you both.

09:25.465 --> 09:27.267
I'm nice to meet.

09:27.299 --> 09:29.269
Hey, do you know if we're gonna
be studying operant conditioning

09:29.302 --> 09:30.937
in the first semester,
'cause I hear that's

09:30.971 --> 09:33.105
kind of Professor Walsh's
specialty?

09:33.139 --> 09:36.644
Absolutely. You know her
treatise on Dietrich's work?

09:36.677 --> 09:39.947
I know of it.
It's not in the syllabus,
but it's a fascinating read,

09:39.980 --> 09:41.380
if you're into
that sort of thing.

09:41.413 --> 09:43.082
They have it here.

09:43.115 --> 09:45.451
Oh. Where?
I'll show you.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.320
I don't meet
that many freshmen

09:47.354 --> 09:50.090
that know that much
about psychology.
Well, it's fascinating.

09:50.123 --> 09:53.661
Yeah, you know,
'cause everyone's got a brain.

09:57.831 --> 10:00.366
Or almost everyone.

10:17.350 --> 10:18.786
Hi.

10:18.818 --> 10:21.421
Oh, hi. Are you Buffy?

10:21.453 --> 10:22.923
Yeah.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.957
Kathy.
Hi.

10:24.991 --> 10:26.994
It's nice to meet you.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.495
Yeah.

10:34.201 --> 10:38.304
So, it's a... it's a
pretty nice room, huh?
Hmm.

10:38.337 --> 10:40.673
I was surprised, 'cause
you hear horror stories

10:40.707 --> 10:41.975
about freshman housing.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.943
You took the right side.

10:43.976 --> 10:47.681
Yeah. Um, but, you know,
if you want it...

10:47.715 --> 10:49.282
No, no. I just wanted
to make sure

10:49.316 --> 10:52.351
that that's what you wanted.

10:52.384 --> 10:54.620
You excited
for classes tomorrow?

10:54.653 --> 10:57.190
Painfully.
(laughs)
I bet there's gonna be

10:57.224 --> 10:59.326
a lot of parties
to go to this week, too.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.293
Not that I'm a crazy partier.
I mean...

11:01.327 --> 11:04.965
Oh, and I'm not always this
hyper, either. I'm just excited.

11:04.998 --> 11:08.869
Yeah. Me, too.

11:08.902 --> 11:11.571
Well, I am really glad
they put me with somebody cool.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.139
'Cause I can tell
that you're cool.

11:13.173 --> 11:17.043
I just know that this whole year
is gonna be super fun.

11:19.078 --> 11:22.581
(snoring, smacking her lips)

11:24.616 --> 11:26.586
(snoring)

11:26.619 --> 11:29.822
(sighs softly, snores)

11:29.856 --> 11:33.326
(smacking her lips)

11:33.360 --> 11:35.062
Uh-uh.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.663
(laughs)

11:36.696 --> 11:39.032
Mmm?

11:39.066 --> 11:41.467
(indistinct crowd chatter
and shouting)

11:43.870 --> 11:47.240
The point of this course is not

11:47.274 --> 11:50.878
to critique
popular American culture.

11:50.911 --> 11:54.014
It is not to pick
at it or look

11:54.047 --> 11:55.447
down upon it.

11:55.481 --> 11:58.184
And it is not
to watch videos for credit.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.854
(laughter)
The point is
to examine its...

12:00.888 --> 12:02.855
(whispering):
Do you know
if this class is full yet?

12:02.889 --> 12:05.759
(whispering)
And there are two
people talking at once,

12:05.793 --> 12:08.028
and I know that
one of them is me.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.730
And the other is...

12:10.764 --> 12:12.631
a blonde girl.

12:12.664 --> 12:14.802
You,

12:14.835 --> 12:17.203
blonde girl, stand up.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.239
(class murmuring)

12:19.272 --> 12:21.707
I'm very excited to hear
what you have to say that...

12:21.740 --> 12:23.610
that's worth interrupting
my lecture for.

12:29.950 --> 12:34.254
I was just asking
if the class was still open,

12:34.287 --> 12:36.222
if I could still

12:36.255 --> 12:37.724
sign up.

12:37.756 --> 12:40.126
If your name
isn't on this sheet,

12:40.159 --> 12:42.062
then you are wasting
everyone's time.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.663
Are you on the sheet?

12:43.696 --> 12:47.267
They told me that if I just...
Do you understand?

12:47.299 --> 12:50.102
You are sucking energy
from everyone in this room.

12:50.136 --> 12:52.605
They came
here to learn.

12:52.639 --> 12:55.142
Get out.

12:56.676 --> 12:59.745
I didn't mean to... suck.

12:59.778 --> 13:01.581
Leave!

13:01.614 --> 13:03.682
Thank you.

13:03.716 --> 13:06.119
(class murmuring)

13:10.190 --> 13:12.625
(indistinct crowd chatter)

13:18.030 --> 13:20.100
If, uh, you're looking for
psych, it's through here.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.501
Oh, thanks.

13:22.534 --> 13:24.004
How's your head?

13:24.037 --> 13:25.437
Sorry?

13:25.471 --> 13:29.009
Yesterday. In the bookstore.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.442
You don't remember.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.011
Oh, no. Sorry.
I remember you.

13:32.044 --> 13:34.014
Yeah, you're
Willow's friend.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.115
Yeah.
My head is fine.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.884
It just stung for a bit

13:37.918 --> 13:40.052
and I lost most
of my basic motor functions.

13:40.086 --> 13:43.023
It's no biggie.
We're here.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.960
I'm sorry. I'm trying
to remember you.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.361
Buffy.
Buffy. Right.

13:49.395 --> 13:51.999
Have fun tonight, okay?
Thanks.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.969
You know, I was just

13:56.003 --> 13:58.738
wondering.
Professor Walsh

13:58.770 --> 14:00.706
isn't planning on yelling at me

14:00.740 --> 14:02.808
and kicking me out
of the class, is she?

14:02.841 --> 14:05.711
It's not in her lesson plan.

14:05.745 --> 14:08.081
Great.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.422
How was Pop Culture?

14:15.455 --> 14:18.825
I decided not to take it.

14:18.857 --> 14:20.659
It seemed dull.

14:20.692 --> 14:23.663
Okay, this is Psych 105,
Introduction to Psychology.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.131
I'm Professor Walsh.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.600
Those of you who fall
into my good graces

14:28.634 --> 14:30.169
will come to know me as Maggie.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.904
Those of you who don't
will come to know me

14:31.938 --> 14:35.575
by the name my T.A.s use
and think I don't know about--

14:35.607 --> 14:38.878
"the evil bitch-monster
of death."
(laughter)

14:38.912 --> 14:41.681
Make no mistake,
I run a hard class.

14:41.713 --> 14:43.549
I assign a lot of work,
I talk fast,

14:43.582 --> 14:45.085
and I expect you to keep up.

14:45.118 --> 14:48.054
If you're looking to coast,
I recommend Geology 101.

14:48.087 --> 14:50.822
That's where
the football players are.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.697
(bird calling)

14:57.730 --> 15:00.100
(distant shouting)

15:03.302 --> 15:05.605
Oh!
Oh!

15:05.638 --> 15:09.308
Wow. Sorry.
No, I-I wasn't looking.

15:09.341 --> 15:12.211
Did you, uh, lose your way?

15:12.245 --> 15:15.748
Me? Oh, no, no, no. I'm
just going to Fischer Hall,

15:15.782 --> 15:19.418
which I know is on
the Earth planet.

15:19.451 --> 15:22.754
Uh, recently voted
"Most Pathetic," uh-huh.

15:22.788 --> 15:25.792
Mmm, well, I'm lost,
and I have a map, so...

15:25.825 --> 15:27.759
Oh. I come in second.

15:27.793 --> 15:28.995
I'm Buffy, by the way.

15:29.028 --> 15:30.897
Eddie.

15:30.929 --> 15:33.566
Okay, so...

15:33.600 --> 15:35.902
So that's Fischer
Hall, right?

15:35.934 --> 15:38.171
Okay, and this is
Dunworth Building.

15:38.205 --> 15:39.672
That's my dorm.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.908
It's just it-it's us
I can't find.

15:41.941 --> 15:45.611
Are we the blue part?
No. Yes.

15:45.644 --> 15:47.413
Okay, right, so, if I...
if I came from there,

15:47.447 --> 15:51.618
then we would just want to go
that way to the bike path.

15:51.650 --> 15:55.154
You sound very certain.
I'm in.

15:57.057 --> 16:01.193
Are you taking Psych 105
with Professor Walsh?

16:01.227 --> 16:04.197
Yeah. I mean,
I'm gonna try.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.365
She's not afraid of
the long words, huh?

16:06.399 --> 16:07.933
Yeah, she's
pretty intense.

16:07.966 --> 16:09.668
A lot of the courses
are really tough.

16:09.701 --> 16:11.303
I'm a little upset.

16:11.337 --> 16:13.706
I had it on good authority
this was a party school.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.807
I think it's supposed
to get easier.

16:15.841 --> 16:19.479
I still feel like carrying
around a security blanket.

16:19.511 --> 16:23.216
Of Human Bondage.
Have you ever read it?

16:23.250 --> 16:25.684
Oh, I'm not
really into porn.

16:25.717 --> 16:28.288
I mean, I'm just... I'm
trying to cut way back.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.791
No, there's no actual bondage.
It's just a novel.

16:31.823 --> 16:33.860
I've read it,
like, ten times.

16:33.893 --> 16:37.230
I always keep it
by my bed.

16:37.264 --> 16:39.066
Security blanket.

16:39.099 --> 16:42.134
I don't really have
a security blanket,

16:42.168 --> 16:44.836
unless, of course,
you count Mr. Pointy.

16:44.870 --> 16:46.173
Mr. Pointy?

16:46.206 --> 16:48.140
Oh, bike path.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.909
So, it's nice to know
that I'm not the only

16:50.942 --> 16:52.644
entirely-confused
person on this campus.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.413
I suspect there's
a lot of us.

16:54.447 --> 16:57.917
Well, I'll look
for you in Psych.
Yeah. Maybe we can

16:57.950 --> 17:00.086
help each other figure out what
the hell they're talking about.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.721
(laughs)
Okay.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.490
Maybe even make it
through the year. (laughs)

17:03.523 --> 17:06.692
Good night.
Good night.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.438
(muffled groaning)

17:20.740 --> 17:25.211
I'm sorry.
Did you lose your way?

17:25.243 --> 17:26.944
(growling)

17:58.911 --> 18:01.181
(door closes)

18:02.914 --> 18:05.652
(crowd chatter)

18:10.190 --> 18:12.625
You looking
for someone?

18:12.659 --> 18:14.059
Yeah.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.962
You made a friend?
Good for you.

18:16.996 --> 18:18.931
Thanks, Mom.

18:18.964 --> 18:21.300
MAN:
 Yeah.

18:21.334 --> 18:24.304
Eddie just took off. Packed
his stuff, left a note.

18:24.336 --> 18:27.673
Happens sometimes. Some people
just can't handle it.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.608
There's always
a few kids who lose it

18:29.642 --> 18:32.845
early in the first semester
and just bail.

18:32.878 --> 18:35.448
Weak ones, I guess.

18:56.836 --> 19:00.339
* Life is a joke
you need but I don't *
WOMAN: Boring. Boring.

19:00.373 --> 19:03.210
* And everybody is crazy
Boring.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.978
* I'm not what I seem
Boring.

19:06.011 --> 19:07.880
* Alone in a dream
Boring.

19:07.913 --> 19:10.383
* I may not be,
but I'm lazy... *
Boring.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.018
(sigh)
Astonishingly boring.

19:12.050 --> 19:14.520
We... we have to kill
some cooler people.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.954
Will somebody remind me?

19:15.988 --> 19:17.557
WOMAN:
You're the one who said

19:17.589 --> 19:21.361
pick on the weak ones,
thin the herd and all that.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.863
Does this sweater
make me look fat?

19:23.895 --> 19:27.133
No. The fact that you're fat
makes you look fat.

19:27.165 --> 19:30.737
That sweater just makes you look
purple.

19:30.769 --> 19:32.971
(sigh)
You're such a loser.

19:33.005 --> 19:36.375
Hey, words can hurt like a fist.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.744
Hey, check it out.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.145
Well?

19:40.179 --> 19:42.013
Do we have a Klimt?

19:43.215 --> 19:44.550
Yes!

19:44.584 --> 19:47.153
Big score for Klimt.

19:47.185 --> 19:50.021
Monet still well in the lead,

19:50.056 --> 19:54.594
but look out for Team Klimt
coming from behind.

19:54.626 --> 19:57.564
Freshmen. Man,
they're so predictable.

19:57.596 --> 20:01.367
And you can never eat just one.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.701
Yeah, I'm hungry.

20:02.734 --> 20:04.436
What a shock.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.739
We eat when I say we eat.

20:06.772 --> 20:09.008
Well, we could hit the tunnels.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.611
We eat when I say we eat!

20:11.644 --> 20:13.613
God, lighten up.

20:13.645 --> 20:17.115
MAN:
I think it's funny
when you scream.

20:17.148 --> 20:19.685
It's like... (roars) Whoa!

20:19.719 --> 20:21.288
I got to get me

20:21.320 --> 20:22.954
some better lackeys, I swear.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.924
You guys are useless.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.394
I shouldn't even
take you on the hunt.

20:27.426 --> 20:29.561
Great. Why don't you let
dead Eddie get you dinner?

20:29.596 --> 20:32.332
That's pretty much the plan.

20:36.167 --> 20:41.039
(knocking)
* And fly it from the toppest
tops of all the tops *

20:41.073 --> 20:45.278
* That man has pushed
beyond his brain... *

20:45.311 --> 20:46.778
Giles?

20:46.813 --> 20:48.448
Rupert, is this
bleu cheese,

20:48.480 --> 20:51.250
or is it just cheese
that's gone blue?

20:51.284 --> 20:53.452
* We scanned the skies
with rainbow eyes... *

20:53.486 --> 20:56.221
You're not Giles.

20:56.255 --> 21:00.492
Um, you know, the-the door
was open, so I just...

21:00.527 --> 21:04.130
Uh, Giles does still
live here, right?

21:04.163 --> 21:05.498
He does.
(Giles clears his throat)

21:05.531 --> 21:07.232
(music turns off)
He appears.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.568
Rupert, you
have a guest.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.170
Buffy, hello.

21:11.202 --> 21:15.074
Is this a bad time?

21:15.106 --> 21:17.410
No. Oh, uh, forgive me.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.679
Um, this is, uh, Olivia.

21:19.711 --> 21:21.480
She's a...
she's an old friend.

21:21.513 --> 21:24.083
She's staying over
for a few days.

21:24.115 --> 21:25.751
OLIVIA:
Couldn't pass through
Sunny Cal without

21:25.785 --> 21:28.253
looking up old Ripper.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.323
Uh-huh.
GILES:
Buffy is, um...

21:30.356 --> 21:31.958
was a student of mine.

21:31.990 --> 21:34.661
And how is university?
Pretty much

21:34.693 --> 21:37.963
the same as high school,
in the sense of I need help.

21:37.997 --> 21:41.367
Ah. Help, yes.
But this just

21:41.401 --> 21:43.802
looks like a bad time.
OLIVIA:
No.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.372
You guys talk.
I'll go slip into something

21:45.404 --> 21:47.707
a little less comfortable.

21:50.209 --> 21:53.311
So, uh, trouble
with, um, studies?

21:53.346 --> 21:55.847
(door closes)
This is a bad time.

21:55.882 --> 21:58.518
You keep saying that.
Well, it looks pretty bad.

21:58.550 --> 22:00.118
I think someone had
just a little too much

22:00.152 --> 22:01.354
free time on their hands.

22:01.387 --> 22:03.823
I'm not supposed
to have a private life?

22:03.855 --> 22:08.661
No. Because you're very,
very old, and it's gross.

22:08.694 --> 22:12.330
Well, before I succumb
to the ravages of age,

22:12.365 --> 22:15.000
why don't you tell me
what brings you here?

22:16.234 --> 22:19.506
There's a student missing.
Yes?

22:19.538 --> 22:23.009
Eddie. He's supposed
to have left school,

22:23.041 --> 22:25.044
but I just don't
think he did.

22:25.076 --> 22:27.413
I met him outside last
night, and then I went

22:27.446 --> 22:30.750
back where we met, and it looked
like there'd been a struggle.

22:30.782 --> 22:33.219
And?
And we need
to stop this.

22:33.251 --> 22:35.086
I mean, Eddie's R.A.
said kids disappear a lot.

22:35.121 --> 22:37.557
There could be a gang of
vampires working the campus.

22:37.589 --> 22:41.027
We need research
and-and charts and stuff.

22:41.059 --> 22:43.395
I-I still don't see
where I fit in.

22:43.430 --> 22:44.830
I mean, you haven't
described anything

22:44.864 --> 22:48.233
that you can't
do yourself.
Okay.

22:48.267 --> 22:49.868
Remember before you
became Hugh Hefner,

22:49.902 --> 22:51.538
when you used to be a watcher?

22:51.570 --> 22:54.339
Yeah. Well, officially,
you no longer have a watcher.

22:54.373 --> 22:57.343
Buffy, you know I 'll always
be here when you need me.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.546
I mean, your safety is more
important to me than anything,

22:59.578 --> 23:02.749
but you are going to have
to take care of yourself.

23:02.781 --> 23:04.282
You're out of school,

23:04.316 --> 23:06.653
and I can't always
be there to guide you.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.557
I'm sorry to bug you.

23:10.589 --> 23:11.891
Buffy...

23:11.923 --> 23:13.460
Oh, no. I mean,

23:13.492 --> 23:15.126
yeah, you're... you're right.

23:15.161 --> 23:16.895
I can handle this.

23:16.929 --> 23:19.365
It's just I...

23:19.397 --> 23:22.268
I'm on it.

23:22.300 --> 23:23.635
I am here if you need me.

23:23.670 --> 23:25.070
(door closes)

23:25.104 --> 23:27.707
She's gone?
Yes.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.808
So did you help her?

23:29.842 --> 23:32.278
I'm not sure.
Hmm.

23:36.281 --> 23:38.917
(indistinct chatter
and shouting)

23:38.951 --> 23:42.153
How am I supposed to hunt
in this mob?

23:42.188 --> 23:45.525
Don't you people have homes?

23:50.128 --> 23:52.499
Eddie?

23:57.169 --> 23:58.738
Eddie.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.772
Eddie, hey! Wait up.

24:00.807 --> 24:03.509
God, I was worried that
something had happened

24:03.542 --> 24:07.212
to you, and of course it has
because you're a vampire.

24:08.279 --> 24:10.817
I'm sorry.
I'm not.

24:10.849 --> 24:13.451
(grunting and growling)

24:15.453 --> 24:16.655
(growling)

24:16.689 --> 24:18.223
(yells)
(whooshing)

24:22.494 --> 24:24.130
The slayer.

24:24.163 --> 24:28.467
Wow. Um, I heard you
might be coming here.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.769
This is, I mean...

24:30.803 --> 24:33.772
what a challenge.
The slayer.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.307
And you are?

24:35.340 --> 24:36.776
Oh, I'm-I'm Sunday.

24:36.808 --> 24:38.810
I'll be killing you here
in a minute or so.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.680
You know, that threat
gets more frightening

24:40.712 --> 24:42.114
every time I hear it.

24:42.147 --> 24:45.951
Uh, are we gonna fight,
or is there just

24:45.984 --> 24:48.988
gonna be a monster
sarcasm rally?

24:49.020 --> 24:50.923
I'm in for a piece.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.160
Everybody gets to play.

24:54.192 --> 24:58.865
Guys, this is
totally... mine.

24:58.897 --> 25:00.633
MAN:
Okay, but

25:00.666 --> 25:02.201
you got to share
the eatin',

25:02.233 --> 25:05.136
'cause I'm thinkin'
slayer's blood's got to be,

25:05.171 --> 25:08.039
whoa, like Thai stick.

25:08.074 --> 25:11.711
I thought people were supposed
to get smarter in college.

25:11.743 --> 25:14.380
Yeah, I think you had a lot of
misconceptions about college,

25:14.413 --> 25:18.684
like that anyone would be
caught dead wearing that.

25:20.720 --> 25:25.191
(grunting)

25:35.768 --> 25:37.836
Don't take this
the wrong way, but...

25:37.869 --> 25:40.205
you fight like a girl.

25:43.474 --> 25:47.078
(grunting)

25:55.054 --> 25:56.454
(bone cracking)

25:56.488 --> 26:00.058
(grunting, panting))

26:00.092 --> 26:02.493
(man laughing,
Buffy panting)

26:12.605 --> 26:15.007
(groaning)

26:24.683 --> 26:27.519
Freshman.

26:33.592 --> 26:37.296
(lips smacking,
sighs softly)

26:37.328 --> 26:40.266
(snoring)

26:40.298 --> 26:42.669
(gasps, groans)

26:42.701 --> 26:45.136
(snoring)

26:51.609 --> 26:54.145
(indistinct, overlapping
crowd chatter)

27:13.965 --> 27:16.602
(raucous laughter)

27:16.634 --> 27:18.136
No, no, no, no, no.

27:18.170 --> 27:21.140
The best part was
when you ragged on her clothes.

27:21.173 --> 27:25.544
She was like, "No,
not the ensemble."

27:25.576 --> 27:27.980
(laughter)

27:28.013 --> 27:30.950
Those jeans with
the little patches?

27:30.982 --> 27:32.884
She has no one to blame
but herself.

27:32.919 --> 27:34.686
I heard they're comin' back.

27:34.721 --> 27:38.023
Not if I kill every single
person who wears them.

27:38.057 --> 27:40.125
Still think you should
have let us have a piece.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.527
We could've
finished her off.

27:41.559 --> 27:43.295
She's not gonna last the night.

27:43.328 --> 27:46.065
She's a done deal.

27:46.097 --> 27:49.335
In fact, guys,

27:49.367 --> 27:51.770
you're gonna hit the tunnels.

28:04.250 --> 28:06.684
Mom?

28:10.056 --> 28:11.656
Buffy.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.058
Hi.

28:13.092 --> 28:14.861
Hi, honey, how are you?

28:14.894 --> 28:16.095
I'm okay.

28:16.127 --> 28:18.263
How's college?
Have you been fighting?

28:18.297 --> 28:21.032
Oh, uh, they
started it.

28:21.067 --> 28:23.335
Oh, just as long
as you're being careful.

28:23.368 --> 28:26.838
I really didn't think you'd,
uh, show here for a while.

28:26.873 --> 28:29.909
Oh, I didn't have
classes today,

28:29.942 --> 28:32.111
and everything's
just been so hectic,

28:32.144 --> 28:34.613
I figured it be nice
to come and crash... for...

28:35.781 --> 28:37.750
Oh, well, yeah.

28:37.784 --> 28:39.885
You know, I-I didn't
think you'd be back for

28:39.919 --> 28:42.253
a couple of weeks,
but I didn't move anything.

28:42.288 --> 28:43.721
It's still your room.

28:43.756 --> 28:46.291
You filled it
with packing crates.

28:46.325 --> 28:48.527
Yeah, but I-I didn't
move anything.

28:48.559 --> 28:50.528
If it's still my room,

28:50.561 --> 28:52.597
shouldn't I be able
to fit in it?

28:52.631 --> 28:55.034
Well, it's just
for a couple of weeks

28:55.067 --> 28:57.135
while we do inventory
at the gallery.

28:57.169 --> 29:00.071
I just really didn't think
you'd be back so soon.

29:00.105 --> 29:02.974
Neither did I.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.746
(telephone rings)

29:12.317 --> 29:13.819
Hello?

29:13.853 --> 29:15.954
(silence)

29:15.988 --> 29:18.423
Hello?

29:22.961 --> 29:25.364
(indistinct crowd chatter)

30:06.038 --> 30:10.977
* We are

30:14.813 --> 30:17.816
* Electricity

30:24.323 --> 30:29.161
* Conducting sparks

30:32.397 --> 30:36.801
* Shower with me...

30:36.835 --> 30:39.204
(crowd chatter)

30:45.044 --> 30:50.182
* We made this about

30:53.285 --> 30:59.391
* We made this about

31:01.192 --> 31:05.064
* You and me

31:05.096 --> 31:07.532
(laughter and chatter)

31:09.601 --> 31:13.905
* You and me

31:22.048 --> 31:25.917
* Woven

31:29.288 --> 31:31.257
* On the couch...

31:31.289 --> 31:36.095
The whole world in front of her,
and she comes back to this dive.

31:36.127 --> 31:37.462
Xander!
Hey, Buff.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.865
Oh. When did
you get back?

31:39.897 --> 31:43.535
Couple days ago.
Freak of nature.
Why didn't you call me?

31:43.568 --> 31:44.971
Well, I knew you guys
were starting the whole

31:45.003 --> 31:46.904
college adventure,
and I didn't want to, um,

31:46.939 --> 31:49.474
you know... help you move.

31:49.508 --> 31:52.111
I missed you.
How was your trip?

31:52.144 --> 31:54.279
Is America nice?
I hear it's nice.

31:54.313 --> 31:57.648
There are some purple mountains
majesty I'm gonna have to say.

31:57.682 --> 32:00.152
Well, what'd you do,
what'd ya see?

32:00.185 --> 32:01.619
Well...

32:01.653 --> 32:04.823
Tell me.
Grand Canyon.

32:04.855 --> 32:06.625
Saw the Grand Canyon.

32:06.657 --> 32:09.228
Well, I saw the movie
 Grand Canyon on cable.

32:09.260 --> 32:10.895
Really lame.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.298
Huh?

32:12.330 --> 32:14.299
Basically, I got
as far as Oxnard,

32:14.333 --> 32:16.402
and the engine
fell out of my car.

32:16.434 --> 32:17.803
And that was literally.

32:17.836 --> 32:19.837
So I ended up
washing dishes

32:19.871 --> 32:21.440
at The Fabulous
Ladies' Night Club

32:21.472 --> 32:22.974
for about a month and a half

32:23.009 --> 32:24.643
while I tried to pay
for the repairs.

32:24.675 --> 32:27.578
No one really bothered
me or even spoke to me

32:27.613 --> 32:29.914
until one night, when one of the
male strippers called in sick,

32:29.948 --> 32:31.450
and no power on this earth

32:31.482 --> 32:33.085
will make me tell you
the rest of that story.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.686
Suffice to say
I traded my car in

32:35.721 --> 32:37.756
for one that wasn't
entirely made of rust,

32:37.788 --> 32:40.159
came trundling back home to the
arms of my loving parents,

32:40.192 --> 32:42.028
where everything was
exactly as it was,

32:42.060 --> 32:44.863
except I sleep in the basement,
and I have to pay rent.

32:44.895 --> 32:46.597
(laughs)
How's college?

32:46.632 --> 32:48.134
Male strippers?

32:48.166 --> 32:49.835
No power on this earth.

32:49.867 --> 32:53.372
Okay. College is good.

32:53.404 --> 32:57.108
Okay, once more with
even less feeling.

32:57.143 --> 32:59.478
No, really. I mean,
Willow's in heaven,

32:59.510 --> 33:04.349
and Oz has this really cool
house off-campus with the band.

33:04.383 --> 33:06.817
And you're sitting here alone
at the Bronze looking like

33:06.852 --> 33:09.454
you just got diagnosed
with cancer of the puppy.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.557
Nah, it's just...

33:12.590 --> 33:16.662
There was this vampire,
and she took me down,

33:16.694 --> 33:19.865
and I just... I don't know
how to stop her.

33:19.897 --> 33:21.500
Then where's the gang?

33:21.532 --> 33:23.469
Avengers assemble.
Let's get it going.

33:23.501 --> 33:24.970
No, I don't want to bug them.

33:25.002 --> 33:27.005
I mean, they're just
starting school.

33:27.038 --> 33:28.673
They don't need this.

33:28.707 --> 33:32.278
Okay, Buff, what's
the what here?

33:34.079 --> 33:37.316
It's just...

33:37.348 --> 33:39.550
What if I can't cut it?

33:39.585 --> 33:42.253
Can't cut what? Slaying?

33:42.288 --> 33:45.290
Slaying, everything.

33:47.093 --> 33:49.861
Buffy, this is
all about fear.

33:49.894 --> 33:52.597
It's understandable, but you
can't let it control you.

33:52.631 --> 33:55.601
Fear leads to anger.

33:55.634 --> 33:58.436
Anger leads to hate.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.405
Hate leads to anger.

34:00.439 --> 34:02.773
No, wait. Hold on.

34:02.807 --> 34:05.743
Fear leads to hate.

34:05.777 --> 34:07.578
Hate leads to the dark side.

34:07.613 --> 34:09.748
Hold on. No.

34:09.780 --> 34:13.018
Um... first you
get the women,

34:13.050 --> 34:15.420
then you get the
money, then you...

34:15.454 --> 34:17.322
Okay, can we forget that?

34:18.590 --> 34:20.056
Thanks for the Dada-ist
pep talk.

34:20.092 --> 34:22.960
I feel much more abstract now.

34:22.994 --> 34:26.465
The point is, you're Buffy.
Yeah.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.400
Maybe in high school
I was Buffy...

34:28.434 --> 34:31.036
And now, in college,
you're Betty Louise?

34:31.068 --> 34:34.405
Yeah, I'm Betty Louise Plotnik,
Reece Cupcake, Illinois.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.775
Or I might as well be.

34:39.277 --> 34:42.148
(sighs)
Buffy...

34:42.181 --> 34:45.251
I've gone through some
fairly dark times in my life.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.786
Faced some scary things,

34:47.818 --> 34:51.289
among them, the kitchen at The
Fabulous Ladies' Night Club.

34:51.322 --> 34:52.757
Let me tell you something.

34:52.791 --> 34:55.827
When it's dark
and I'm all alone,

34:55.860 --> 34:58.063
and I'm scared
or freaked out or whatever,

34:58.096 --> 34:59.664
I always think,

34:59.697 --> 35:02.534
"What would Buffy do?"

35:03.802 --> 35:05.637
You're my hero.

35:08.039 --> 35:11.076
Okay, sometimes when it's dark
and I'm all alone,

35:11.108 --> 35:13.478
I'd think,
"What is Buffy wearing?"

35:13.512 --> 35:16.282
Can that be one of those things
you never, ever tell me about?

35:16.315 --> 35:18.717
It's a deal.

35:20.385 --> 35:22.353
Let's put this bitch
in the ground.

35:22.387 --> 35:24.822
What do you say?

35:27.226 --> 35:29.427
I think...

35:29.460 --> 35:33.130
I say thank you.

35:33.164 --> 35:36.168
And nothing says thank you
like dollars in the waistband.

35:36.202 --> 35:38.670
Okay, what do we do first?

35:41.539 --> 35:44.041
Kids disappearing every year.

35:44.074 --> 35:45.643
Not too many, just enough

35:45.677 --> 35:47.978
so that everyone thinks
they up and left.

35:48.012 --> 35:51.449
I can't believe the vampires
took your stuff.

35:51.483 --> 35:52.983
Murder I expect, but

35:53.018 --> 35:55.387
petty larceny seems so... petty.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.054
Well, they have
to be keeping it

35:57.088 --> 36:00.791
somewhere, on campus
or at least nearby.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.695
Hey, how far back
do the disappearances go?

36:03.728 --> 36:09.235
Uh... they weren't
too common before '82.

36:09.268 --> 36:12.170
Magic number.
Check this out.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.974
"Psi-Theta Loses its Charter.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.842
Building to be Closed
for Renovation"?

36:17.876 --> 36:20.545
1982. Look at this.

36:20.579 --> 36:23.315
"The former Psi-Theta
Fraternity House lies dormant

36:23.349 --> 36:26.150
while zoning issues drag on
before the city council."

36:26.184 --> 36:27.918
We have a winner.
Looks pretty cherry.

36:27.952 --> 36:30.222
You up for a little
reconnaissance?

36:32.056 --> 36:34.693
You mean where we all sculpt
and paint and stuff?
No.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.695
That was the Renaissance.

36:36.728 --> 36:39.864
Oh. I've had a
really long week.

36:39.898 --> 36:41.932
Let's go look
at the house.

36:53.612 --> 36:57.449
Oh.
(laughter)

36:58.717 --> 37:01.119
Score.

37:02.887 --> 37:05.757
Look how tough I am.
BUFFY:
Oh.

37:05.791 --> 37:07.693
That's my skirt.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.128
You're never gonna fit in it
with those hips.

37:10.161 --> 37:11.463
We have to kill them.

37:11.496 --> 37:13.731
We need weapons.
I don't see

37:13.764 --> 37:15.233
my weapons trunk down there.

37:15.266 --> 37:17.869
It was right by my bed.
Yeah.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.605
Mr. Gordo?

37:19.637 --> 37:21.773
(whooping
and indistinct chatter)

37:21.806 --> 37:23.208
(inhales sharply
through her nose)

37:23.240 --> 37:24.610
Go to my room.

37:24.643 --> 37:26.244
If it's not there, try Willow's.

37:26.277 --> 37:27.813
I'll keep an eye...

37:27.846 --> 37:30.114
My diary?!

37:30.148 --> 37:32.217
Uh-oh, score.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.320
I'll hurry.

37:38.824 --> 37:40.791
Oh, look how tough I am.

37:40.826 --> 37:42.994
BUFFY:
Laugh all you want.

37:43.027 --> 37:45.963
This time, we play it my way,
and the rules are gonna be just

37:45.996 --> 37:48.233
a little...

37:48.266 --> 37:50.436
(Buffy grunts, others gasping)

37:50.469 --> 37:53.972
Aah. Aah.

37:55.673 --> 37:58.309
Oh.

38:01.512 --> 38:04.349
Say, don't I
know you from...

38:04.382 --> 38:06.851
beating the crap out of you?

38:06.885 --> 38:12.724
I just thought I'd drop in.
Get it? Drop in?

38:14.059 --> 38:17.128
Boy, tough room.
I must say,

38:17.161 --> 38:19.030
you've really got me now.
I mean,

38:19.063 --> 38:21.032
this is a
diabolical plan.

38:21.065 --> 38:22.867
Throw yourself at my feet
with a broken arm

38:22.900 --> 38:24.302
and no weapons of any kind.

38:24.335 --> 38:26.271
How am I gonna
get out of this one?

38:26.304 --> 38:30.708
You got a nice setup here,
but you made one mistake.

38:30.742 --> 38:32.210
What was that?

38:32.242 --> 38:34.480
Well, I'm not actually positive,

38:34.512 --> 38:35.880
but statistically speaking,

38:35.914 --> 38:37.349
people usually make at least...
(grunting)

38:37.382 --> 38:38.784
It seemed kind of weird.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.851
Yeah, weird's a pretty
good word for it.

38:40.885 --> 38:44.789
Buffy wouldn't just
take off. That's just not

38:44.822 --> 38:47.492
in her nature,
except for that one time

38:47.525 --> 38:50.027
she disappeared for several
months and changed her name,

38:50.061 --> 38:52.063
but there were
circumstances then.

38:52.097 --> 38:53.699
There's no circumstances.

38:53.731 --> 38:55.967
KATHY:
Does Buffy have a history
of emotional problems?

38:56.001 --> 38:58.036
'Cause on my request form,

38:58.068 --> 39:00.639
I was pretty specific
about a stable non-smoker.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.407
I don't think
this is her handwriting.

39:02.440 --> 39:05.976
I bet there were circumstances.

39:06.010 --> 39:09.514
We've probably been so wrapped
up in our own petty lives

39:09.547 --> 39:11.849
that-that we totally missed
the circumstances.

39:11.882 --> 39:14.152
We're bad friends.

39:14.184 --> 39:15.554
Well, let's think this through.

39:15.586 --> 39:17.722
How can you be so calm?

39:17.755 --> 39:20.391
Long, arduous hours of practice.

39:20.425 --> 39:22.260
Now, either Buffy took off,

39:22.293 --> 39:23.661
or she was robbed or...

39:23.695 --> 39:25.329
XANDER:
It's a prank!

39:25.362 --> 39:27.666
Xander.
How are

39:27.699 --> 39:30.101
my guys?

39:31.302 --> 39:33.271
I don't know you, do I?

39:33.304 --> 39:34.840
No.

39:34.873 --> 39:38.610
This is very intrusive,
isn't it?
Little bit.

39:38.643 --> 39:40.344
Xander.
Kathy.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.947
Do we hug?

39:41.980 --> 39:43.248
I think we're too manly.

39:43.280 --> 39:45.451
What's the prank?
Prank?

39:45.483 --> 39:47.184
Oh, the room.

39:47.217 --> 39:49.286
Well, some friends of Buffy's
played a funny joke,

39:49.320 --> 39:50.556
and they took
her stuff and now

39:50.588 --> 39:52.222
she wants us to
help get it back

39:52.257 --> 39:55.693
from her friends who sleep
all day and have no tans.

39:55.726 --> 39:57.795
Oh, those friends.

39:57.829 --> 39:59.664
Funny guys.
(Xander laughs)

40:00.931 --> 40:02.701
They took the chest.

40:02.733 --> 40:05.804
Well, let's go.
Let's go to our friend.

40:05.836 --> 40:07.371
It was nice
meeting you, Kathy.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.974
You, too.

40:09.007 --> 40:10.541
Let's go to Will's,
get supplies.

40:10.576 --> 40:12.043
Is Buffy in danger?

40:12.077 --> 40:14.713
She's in a holding pattern.
We've got some time.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.315
(blow landing,
Buffy groaning)

40:18.449 --> 40:20.818
(panting)

40:20.851 --> 40:23.054
Oh, and this.

40:23.088 --> 40:25.891
This is my favorite item.

40:25.923 --> 40:27.992
You don't want to touch that.

40:32.864 --> 40:34.666
(groaning, cracking)
You know,

40:34.699 --> 40:36.166
this arm's not looking so good.
(groaning)

40:36.201 --> 40:38.637
(sighs)
It might have to come off.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.505
You want to know the truth?

40:40.539 --> 40:42.106
I only need one.

40:42.139 --> 40:44.710
(grunting)

40:55.721 --> 40:57.989
This is startin' to suck.

40:58.023 --> 41:01.326
(growling)

41:01.358 --> 41:02.927
Ooh.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.996
(grunting, indistinct shouting)

41:10.400 --> 41:13.403
(yelling)

41:16.007 --> 41:19.409
(grunts)
Oh.

41:20.646 --> 41:21.980
Whoa.

41:22.012 --> 41:23.782
BUFFY:
When you look back at this,

41:23.815 --> 41:26.384
in the three seconds
it'll take you to turn to dust,

41:26.416 --> 41:29.320
I think you'll find the mistake
was touching my stuff.

41:29.353 --> 41:33.559
(grunting)

41:33.592 --> 41:35.860
What about breaking your arm?

41:35.893 --> 41:38.128
(groaning, cracking)
How does that feel?

41:38.163 --> 41:40.331
Let me answer that question
with a head-butt.

41:40.364 --> 41:42.132
(grunting)

41:42.166 --> 41:44.536
(growling, grunting)

41:47.338 --> 41:50.175
And for the record...
the arm is hurt.

41:50.208 --> 41:52.744
(grunting, growling)
It's not broken.

41:53.844 --> 41:56.481
(growling)

41:56.514 --> 41:58.583
Hey, Buff.

41:58.617 --> 42:00.418
Need a hand?

42:00.451 --> 42:02.519
(wind whipping)
No, thanks.

42:03.221 --> 42:05.657
(grunts, growls)

42:05.690 --> 42:07.826
I'm good.

42:07.858 --> 42:10.260
(whooshing)

42:14.065 --> 42:16.568
So, all that other
stuff in there--

42:16.601 --> 42:18.335
that's just gonna
sit in there, right?

42:18.369 --> 42:21.172
I mean, no one owns it
in the strictest sense.

42:21.206 --> 42:22.773
It seems wrong somehow.

42:22.807 --> 42:25.110
Dibs on the
rowing machine.
GILES: Buffy!

42:27.579 --> 42:29.914
Hi, Giles.
What's with
the arsenal?

42:29.947 --> 42:32.349
I've been awake all night.

42:32.382 --> 42:34.552
I know I'm supposed to
teach you self-reliance,

42:34.585 --> 42:36.755
but I can't leave you
out there to fight alone.

42:36.788 --> 42:40.458
Uh, to hell with what's right.
I-I'm ready to back you up.

42:40.490 --> 42:43.661
Let's find the evil
and-and-and fight it together.

42:44.963 --> 42:48.565
Great. Thanks.
We'll get right on that.

42:49.800 --> 42:51.268
The evil is this way?

42:51.302 --> 42:53.304
My room is.
WILLOW:
Hey, Giles,

42:53.338 --> 42:56.074
can you get this box
on top?
Um...

42:56.106 --> 42:59.911
So, college not so
scary after all, huh?

42:59.945 --> 43:02.047
It's turning out to be
a lot like high school,

43:02.079 --> 43:03.914
which I can handle.

43:03.949 --> 43:07.085
At least I know what to expect.

43:07.117 --> 43:09.487
(growling)

43:15.460 --> 43:19.197
(twigs snapping)

43:20.998 --> 43:23.668
(shots firing, electrical
hissing, groaning)

43:23.702 --> 43:25.269
(hissing)

43:25.302 --> 43:27.672
(groaning)

43:27.706 --> 43:32.143
(guttural gasping)

43:32.177 --> 43:34.378
(shallow breathing)

43:37.815 --> 43:39.985
(shallow breathing)

43:42.853 --> 43:44.621
(gasping)

44:21.326 --> 44:23.728
Grr. Argh.
