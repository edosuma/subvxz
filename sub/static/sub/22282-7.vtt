00:22.267 --> 00:24.033
(GUNSHOTS)

00:32.067 --> 00:33.167
ANDY: Boom.

00:34.767 --> 00:36.767
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:59.300 --> 01:01.100
ANDY: This is my hunting dog.

01:01.167 --> 01:04.767
My hunting dog.
Come on, hunting dog.

01:04.833 --> 01:06.733
I think we shot
pretty straight.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.367
My name's Andy Bassich.

01:08.433 --> 01:10.400
I've been living
on the Yukon River now,

01:10.467 --> 01:12.300
for about 30 years.

01:12.367 --> 01:14.667
I spent my youth
near Washington, D.C.,

01:14.733 --> 01:17.100
moved up to Alaska
when I was 22.

01:17.167 --> 01:19.467
I got a canoe,
floated down to Eagle

01:19.533 --> 01:21.133
and never left.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.100
Ultimately, I think
the reason I love here

01:23.167 --> 01:25.267
is I can carve
a piece of this land out

01:25.333 --> 01:27.667
and make it the way
I want to live.

01:27.733 --> 01:30.333
It's up to me to make
the life I want for myself.

01:30.467 --> 01:33.067
I got to go get
my snow machine all

01:33.133 --> 01:35.633
fuelled up,
get some safety gear in it.

01:35.700 --> 01:37.467
Time to go look for caribou.

01:41.133 --> 01:44.067
How do you get by out here?
Well, we call it subsistence.

01:44.133 --> 01:45.900
And that means
that you're utilising

01:45.967 --> 01:47.900
the resources around you,

01:47.967 --> 01:49.900
the natural resources
around you,

01:49.967 --> 01:52.433
to provide for the things
you need in life.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.233
If it's meat, you hunt.

01:56.667 --> 01:59.233
Well, I'm starting to get up
into high country right now,

01:59.300 --> 02:01.467
there's, uh, some clouds
blowing through.

02:15.867 --> 02:18.433
I got into a bit
of a whiteout up here

02:18.500 --> 02:21.867
and it's not very safe
to travel when it's like that.

02:22.933 --> 02:25.200
You can drive off of
a mountain right into a valley

02:25.267 --> 02:27.300
and you'd never
get out of there.

02:27.367 --> 02:29.867
Snow blows in pretty
deep up here, pretty quick.

02:30.367 --> 02:31.967
When you're up in this stuff,

02:32.033 --> 02:33.500
there's no point
in fighting it,

02:33.567 --> 02:35.833
so I think I'll just
dig a little hole down here

02:35.900 --> 02:37.533
by the snow machine.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.267
Get out of the wind
a little bit...

02:39.333 --> 02:40.533
(GROANS)

02:40.600 --> 02:42.033
And just wait around.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.700
Got myself
an old caribou hide.

02:49.267 --> 02:51.500
Be nice
to get a new one today.

02:52.167 --> 02:56.033
Caribou hides are super warm,
real comfortable to sit on,

02:56.700 --> 02:58.233
keep your butt dry.

02:58.567 --> 03:00.667
Things change up in this
high country really quick.

03:00.733 --> 03:02.000
I'm just gonna hope that

03:02.067 --> 03:03.433
this wind blow these clouds,

03:03.500 --> 03:06.100
or this early morning
fog out of here

03:06.167 --> 03:08.100
and that I get
a little bit of sunshine.

03:08.400 --> 03:11.667
Playing chess
with Mother Nature,
you're always a pawn,

03:11.733 --> 03:15.533
and you're usually
the first one taken
off the board. (LAUGHS)

03:19.867 --> 03:22.967
CHIP: I can't win the weather,
can't win Mother Nature,

03:23.033 --> 03:24.733
and it is the Arctic.

03:35.900 --> 03:38.800
Gonna want to run the boards,
probably like that.

03:38.867 --> 03:41.533
They can sit there off to
the side and we'll rip 'em.

03:42.033 --> 03:44.633
NARRATOR: For the Hailstones,
traversing Noorvik's
frozen pathways,

03:44.700 --> 03:47.667
searching for resources
is crucial this time of year.

03:47.733 --> 03:49.033
Chip and his daughter Iri

03:49.100 --> 03:51.467
are building a vital tool
that is perfectly suited

03:51.533 --> 03:53.033
for their nomadic lifestyle.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.700
I have
some hickory planks over here

03:54.767 --> 03:56.500
and these hickory planks
are something, um,

03:56.567 --> 03:58.367
I'm gonna saw up
and make into a basket sled.

03:58.467 --> 04:00.067
It's a long,
complicated process.

04:00.133 --> 04:02.200
It's gonna take four
or five days, probably six.

04:02.533 --> 04:04.733
I'm gonna feed
it to you from here.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.167
No, we're gonna
clamp the machine.

04:06.233 --> 04:08.567
Oh, yeah, we have to
or this will slide
right off there.

04:08.633 --> 04:09.800
That's why I have
those clamps.

04:09.867 --> 04:11.633
CHIP: Basket sleds
are flexible.

04:11.700 --> 04:14.167
They're long and they twist
and they bend and they give

04:14.233 --> 04:15.967
and they take the energy
and the shock

04:16.033 --> 04:17.867
out of all the travel,
and out of all the stuff

04:17.933 --> 04:19.600
and every hit you make,
it all goes right

04:19.667 --> 04:22.200
through that flex
and you lose the energy.

04:22.867 --> 04:24.900
So you can ride grandmas,

04:24.967 --> 04:27.667
newborn babies,
glass windows.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.400
Um, anything
that you consider fragile

04:29.467 --> 04:31.567
and want to keep safe,
you can ride in a basket sled.

04:31.667 --> 04:33.733
(WHIRRING)

04:34.267 --> 04:36.533
IRIQTAQ: Me, I really enjoy
working with my dad.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.500
He's very thorough
about a lot of things.

04:39.567 --> 04:42.700
He explains himself a lot
and hands-on work

04:42.767 --> 04:44.567
-is how I learn best.
-(CLICKS)

04:44.633 --> 04:46.267
This one wasn't locked down.

04:51.067 --> 04:52.933
CHIP: When they
show me interest
and they want to participate,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.400
I can't tell 'em no.
Instead of telling her
to stand back

04:55.500 --> 04:57.267
and leave me alone
and let me do this,

04:57.333 --> 04:59.100
I'm gonna have her help
and she is a lot of help

04:59.167 --> 05:01.267
because she does kind
of have a good grasp
on what we're doing.

05:01.933 --> 05:03.800
I usually do this myself, Bun.

05:04.567 --> 05:06.533
A lot of fun having
help with you.

05:06.667 --> 05:07.833
I like you kids growing up.

05:10.033 --> 05:12.533
Nice job, just pull it
straight and even.

05:13.700 --> 05:15.667
CHIP: I'm making sure
I get all my pieces
cut at once.

05:15.733 --> 05:17.633
My stanchions, my crosspieces,

05:17.700 --> 05:20.167
my bedding,
my rails on the top

05:20.367 --> 05:22.800
and my runners.
Put my own handiwork into it.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.200
Gonna be a tough one.
You get ready to hold
some weight up.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.733
IRIQTAQ: Getting done
pretty well.

05:31.833 --> 05:33.933
We didn't have any,
um, accidents yet.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.667
I'm just excited to start
putting it together and see

05:37.033 --> 05:39.367
how our work
all fits back together.

05:43.567 --> 05:45.633
SUE: It's perfectly fine
to be ignorant,

05:45.700 --> 05:47.567
because you can always
educate yourself and learn.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.067
Everybody can be taught.

05:59.700 --> 06:01.367
(SIGHS) Big day.

06:03.700 --> 06:06.867
This makes it
almost one year

06:07.467 --> 06:10.400
since I've gotten on
any kind of snow machine.

06:10.700 --> 06:11.933
The last time

06:12.000 --> 06:14.067
I went for any kind
of a lengthy trip

06:14.433 --> 06:17.667
on the machine,
ended up disastrous for me.

06:20.833 --> 06:21.933
(CLATTERS)

06:23.867 --> 06:25.467
NARRATOR: In Kavik,
a severe injury

06:25.533 --> 06:27.067
after crashing on the tundra

06:27.133 --> 06:28.767
caused Sue Aikens
to temporarily

06:28.833 --> 06:30.633
abandon camp for medical aid.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.633
I can't relax my arm.

06:33.767 --> 06:36.133
I can't move, I can't have
any kind of force

06:36.233 --> 06:40.267
or torque on it without
feeling like I'm having
a heart attack or something.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.200
Your collarbone
took the brunt.

06:42.267 --> 06:43.700
There is some findings
on that X-ray

06:43.767 --> 06:45.067
that are
a little bit concerning.

06:45.133 --> 06:47.533
Your clavicles overlapped
almost five centimetres.

06:47.600 --> 06:51.200
-Uh-huh.
-So what I got to do is get
these to kind of key back in.

06:51.733 --> 06:54.367
NARRATOR: After four months
of surgery and recovery,

06:54.433 --> 06:55.833
Sue finally returned to Kavik.

06:56.733 --> 07:00.600
But her absence
cost her thousands of dollars
of food and client revenue.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.400
Rattled but unbroken,

07:03.467 --> 07:05.167
Sue had to rebuild
her business

07:05.233 --> 07:06.600
and relearn valuable skills

07:06.667 --> 07:08.867
to survive in
the harsh tundra environment.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.300
That hurt like
a son of a bitch.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.000
I have some fears,
some trepidation.

07:17.433 --> 07:19.367
NARRATOR: Despite
overcoming many challenges,

07:19.433 --> 07:21.500
and putting her
life back together,

07:21.567 --> 07:23.400
one obstacle remains.

07:24.500 --> 07:25.967
SUE: For the most part,

07:26.033 --> 07:28.867
I am healed in the body.

07:28.933 --> 07:30.233
In the mind,

07:30.300 --> 07:32.100
this thing scares me to death.

07:33.767 --> 07:35.567
So, part of
the healing process

07:35.633 --> 07:38.567
for me is getting back
on the horse, but

07:39.000 --> 07:41.200
there are some changes
to the beasties.

07:42.233 --> 07:45.033
A much wider track,
different kind of seat,

07:45.100 --> 07:47.033
different kind of windscreen.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.800
This helmet plugs in,
keeps it frost-free.

07:51.133 --> 07:53.267
I'm scared. I am afraid of it.

07:53.900 --> 07:56.533
But the only way
to overcome your fears

07:56.600 --> 07:58.000
is to get out there and do it.

07:58.767 --> 08:00.033
(ENGINE REVS)

08:00.300 --> 08:03.367
You know, I only get caught
with my panties down once.

08:03.433 --> 08:04.733
Then it's commando time.

08:08.467 --> 08:10.500
What I want to do today is,

08:10.567 --> 08:12.367
I want to widen
my perimeter check,

08:12.433 --> 08:14.733
take it from 500 yards
to five miles.

08:15.933 --> 08:17.567
What will that tell me?

08:17.633 --> 08:19.133
Are there predators around?

08:19.200 --> 08:21.700
Are there food sources
available to me?

08:22.200 --> 08:23.833
There's a lot I can learn

08:23.900 --> 08:25.333
by getting out there.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.900
This machine helps me
get a little further out,

08:27.967 --> 08:29.900
but not if I don't get
the balls to do it.

08:35.700 --> 08:36.933
GLENN: We evolved out
in nature,

08:37.000 --> 08:38.733
and nature's beautiful to us

08:38.800 --> 08:41.100
and now a lot of people
are separated from it.

08:48.700 --> 08:50.667
Takes a lot of wood
to keep this place heated

08:50.733 --> 08:52.467
when it's down
to 50 below zero.

08:57.700 --> 09:00.433
And I also do all my cooking
on the woodstove.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.233
Heat all my hot water
on the woodstove.

09:02.467 --> 09:04.067
That's the only
source of heat I have.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.033
So I'm gonna go out today
and cut some wood.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.467
Six days ago,

09:10.533 --> 09:12.967
the wood came all the way
to this tree in this woodpile.

09:13.033 --> 09:14.733
In six days,
I used all that wood,

09:14.800 --> 09:17.667
probably about 25 cubic feet
of wood right there.

09:17.733 --> 09:20.267
I got enough for about
two weeks left.

09:20.333 --> 09:21.700
And that's not
a whole lot of reserve

09:21.767 --> 09:24.633
so I got to go up there
and cut some more wood today.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.433
I spend a lot of time
out cutting wood

09:27.500 --> 09:29.733
and it's always nice just
being out in the woods,

09:29.800 --> 09:31.967
getting good exercise
out here in the fresh air,

09:32.233 --> 09:34.367
just paying attention
to the environment.

09:34.433 --> 09:36.933
Sometimes I'll even hear
caribou go by,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.433
or a little snowshoe hare
will go hopping along
when I'm out here.

09:39.500 --> 09:40.867
Sometimes I'll even
hear a wolf

09:40.933 --> 09:42.133
howling over in the distance.

09:46.267 --> 09:48.867
Over the years,
I've depleted the deadwood
close to my camp,

09:48.933 --> 09:51.267
and I have to go
further and further
from camp each year.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.833
I'm over a quarter-mile
from camp now,

09:53.900 --> 09:55.433
in order to get into an area
where there's still

09:55.500 --> 09:56.633
standing dead trees.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.033
There's a nice big
dead tree right there.

10:04.167 --> 10:08.300
It's dead, dry,
and it's a large size.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.033
Problem is, it's hung up with
some other trees here.

10:11.100 --> 10:13.967
I don't know
if I can get that.
That's gonna be tricky.

10:17.100 --> 10:20.400
Wow. That's a big tree
for out here.

10:21.100 --> 10:22.333
Something that size is rare.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.667
There's a lot
of firewood there.

10:23.767 --> 10:26.100
I could heat my camp
for a long time with this

10:26.167 --> 10:27.633
wood from this one tree.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.667
Unfortunately, it already
started to fall down

10:30.733 --> 10:33.367
and it got hung up in a couple
other spruce trees right here.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.000
So a potentially
dangerous situation,

10:35.067 --> 10:36.200
I got to be very careful.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.133
When a tree gets hung up
in other trees like that,

10:40.200 --> 10:42.867
that's called a Widow Maker,
for good reason.

10:43.033 --> 10:46.100
That's one of
the most difficult trees
to cut down safely.

10:46.333 --> 10:47.733
You don't know
which way it's gonna go

10:47.800 --> 10:49.333
and you don't know
what it might knock down

10:49.400 --> 10:50.767
on the way down to the ground.

10:50.833 --> 10:52.533
It's possible that
I can't get it down.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.700
But I'm gonna give
it my best shot.

10:58.433 --> 11:01.000
Out here,
I follow my intuition a lot.

11:01.067 --> 11:03.233
A lot of people today,
they spend a lot of time

11:03.300 --> 11:04.900
justifying their decisions
to other people.

11:04.967 --> 11:06.500
They got to justify
it to their boss,

11:06.567 --> 11:08.500
they got to justify
it to some superior.

11:08.567 --> 11:10.333
Out here when
I make a decision,

11:10.400 --> 11:11.967
I don't have
to justify it to anybody.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.167
And I'm the only one
responsible.

11:14.233 --> 11:15.900
If I get myself hurt,
that's my problem.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.600
I ain't gonna go to any
insurance company
crying about it.

11:18.667 --> 11:22.067
I'm not gonna go to court
and sue somebody
'cause I fucked up.

11:22.133 --> 11:23.833
World's getting
pretty damn safe,

11:23.900 --> 11:25.767
but it's also getting pretty
damn crazy, if you ask me.

11:25.833 --> 11:29.067
Out here, I'm free to act
on my decisions

11:29.133 --> 11:31.567
and I'm free to take
the risks I choose to take,

11:31.733 --> 11:33.033
and right now,
I'm gonna take the risk

11:33.100 --> 11:34.567
of cutting this tree down.

11:36.267 --> 11:37.667
(TREE CREAKS)

11:47.200 --> 11:50.000
Really hard to tell exactly
how this tree's gonna fall.

11:50.067 --> 11:52.567
It's gonna come down
somewhere over here,

11:52.633 --> 11:55.533
or slide back
right towards where I am.

12:08.333 --> 12:09.700
Look out!

12:11.867 --> 12:13.533
There it goes.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.300
Whoo!

12:15.367 --> 12:16.767
Got it down.

12:17.333 --> 12:19.933
Whoo, it was a little hairy.
(SIGHS)

12:22.133 --> 12:23.567
Got it down,

12:23.633 --> 12:25.167
didn't get killed
in the process.

12:25.233 --> 12:28.233
It's been a good day so far.
(LAUGHS)

12:29.800 --> 12:31.333
That was a hard tree
to get down.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.700
It was risky,
but it was a big tree

12:33.800 --> 12:35.767
and a big tree like that
has enough wood in it

12:35.833 --> 12:39.167
for several days,
heating my cabin, cooking,
everything I need wood for.

12:41.433 --> 12:42.467
All right.

12:48.700 --> 12:50.033
There.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.633
Look at that.

12:52.733 --> 12:55.467
Got a nice six-foot length,
that'll fit in my sled.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.367
(SIGHS) Only problem is,

12:58.700 --> 13:00.167
that's one heavy load.

13:00.267 --> 13:02.500
I got to go up
this steep hill right here
on my way to camp,

13:02.567 --> 13:03.967
it's gonna be a big problem.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.033
But if I can get it to split,

13:06.333 --> 13:08.200
I got some wedges with me.

13:08.533 --> 13:10.300
Then it'll be low enough

13:10.367 --> 13:12.367
in the sled,
it won't topple over.

13:12.433 --> 13:14.100
There's a crack
right here that

13:14.167 --> 13:16.133
naturally started
through the log.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.000
Maybe I can get that
to open up further

13:18.067 --> 13:19.767
and split all the way through.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.200
Here, I'll start one
right here.

13:35.233 --> 13:36.233
Yeah.

13:39.933 --> 13:41.300
There it goes.

13:42.633 --> 13:47.000
One of these, probably enough
to get through a whole day.

13:47.067 --> 13:49.133
Sometimes,
when it's real steep,
I just take my snowshoes off

13:49.233 --> 13:51.300
and use 'em
like walking sticks
to stabilise me.

13:51.367 --> 13:53.000
Get a little extra
traction going up.

13:53.067 --> 13:55.067
It takes a lot of energy
to get firewood

13:55.133 --> 13:56.800
and the fact of the matter is
it takes a lot of energy

13:56.867 --> 13:58.767
to do a lot of the jobs
I do out here.

13:58.833 --> 14:00.767
That's the way it is
and that's what
I like about it.

14:00.833 --> 14:02.200
I like staying in shape,
and there's nothing

14:02.267 --> 14:04.467
I'd rather do to stay in shape
than do useful work.

14:04.767 --> 14:07.900
A lot of people are running
on a treadmill at the gym.

14:07.967 --> 14:09.733
I'd rather run up this hill
with a log behind me.

14:10.200 --> 14:11.700
Got up the first hill.

14:13.233 --> 14:15.833
It gives you a good workout,
that's for sure.

14:16.967 --> 14:18.500
Definitely worth the effort.
Even though it was

14:18.567 --> 14:20.700
a difficult tree to get,
there was some risk involved

14:20.767 --> 14:22.667
in cutting it out of those
other two trees,

14:22.733 --> 14:25.067
it's worth it. There's a lot
of firewood in this tree.

14:25.133 --> 14:26.133
(SIGHS)

14:27.933 --> 14:29.667
Nice chunk of wood.

14:30.033 --> 14:31.567
It's gonna be several more
to get it all back,

14:31.633 --> 14:33.967
but that's gonna burn
for a long time in my stove.

14:34.033 --> 14:35.733
It's a lot of heat
right there in that tree.

14:39.067 --> 14:40.833
CHIP: You can call it work.
We sweat.

14:40.900 --> 14:44.000
We get exceedingly tired.
We got a smile on our face.

14:44.067 --> 14:45.100
What more could you want?

14:48.100 --> 14:50.767
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
are building a basket sled,

14:50.833 --> 14:53.667
an essential tool
that aids them
in safely transporting

14:53.800 --> 14:56.133
people or resources
during winter.

14:56.367 --> 14:59.700
Phase two is steaming the wood
for the runners of the sled,

14:59.767 --> 15:01.800
a delicate
and time-consuming process

15:01.867 --> 15:03.800
that must be
handled with care.

15:04.267 --> 15:05.467
CHIP: Just slip 'em
one part at a time

15:05.533 --> 15:06.933
over top of these woods,
I guess.

15:07.033 --> 15:10.067
IRIQTAQ: We're going to lay
the ply boards inside of it,

15:10.300 --> 15:12.100
so it's blocked off

15:12.167 --> 15:14.333
all the moisture
and the air to get into it,

15:14.400 --> 15:17.367
and we just boil water
and let it go into the can,

15:17.467 --> 15:19.567
and then it just steams
the whole entire thing.

15:20.067 --> 15:23.267
It's the most difficult part
of the sled building because

15:23.967 --> 15:26.733
if you don't do it correctly
the wood can split,

15:26.900 --> 15:29.133
or it can splinter off

15:29.200 --> 15:33.433
and it doesn't really make
very strong sled.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.700
Easy to break,
easy to just come apart.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.967
So when you put
that thing, don't tie it in
a knot like a string.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.533
Put 'em together
and go around in circles.

15:39.633 --> 15:40.933
It'll tighten it up.
That way we can make

15:41.000 --> 15:42.800
it kind of waterproof
as best as we can.

15:47.967 --> 15:50.100
CHIP: You got the towel?
Stuff it in as best you can.

15:50.333 --> 15:51.767
But that end's gonna be
the collection end.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.600
What I need is steam head
in here with the pressure

15:54.700 --> 15:56.633
and then it can cool off
down that direction

15:56.700 --> 15:58.367
and get the water collected

15:58.433 --> 16:00.533
and we're gonna spend
a whole day here
boiling stuff up.

16:00.600 --> 16:01.700
I'm gonna need you
to come over here

16:01.767 --> 16:03.433
and lift this
so I can jam this under here

16:03.533 --> 16:04.667
and then I'm gonna
put it on top of this

16:04.733 --> 16:06.700
electrical plate here
so we can boil water.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.700
Okay, hold it up, hold it up,
here goes the electrical.

16:09.933 --> 16:11.133
Okay.

16:11.533 --> 16:13.900
That should be good.
Now set her down, it's good?

16:13.967 --> 16:15.867
CHIP: Tank this up
half way with water,

16:15.933 --> 16:17.533
turn on the electric skillet
underneath it,

16:17.600 --> 16:21.300
start to steam and boil
and transfer heat,
and steam this way.

16:21.367 --> 16:22.967
Now that we have a lower end
where it cools off,

16:23.033 --> 16:24.867
it'll drain off
and we'll pour it back in.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.500
-Now, the wait.
-IRIQTAQ: I ain't gonna

16:26.567 --> 16:28.800
-clean up this mess.
-I'll watch the water.

16:31.433 --> 16:34.000
ANDY: For me,
it's about planning
for the future all the time.

16:34.167 --> 16:37.167
The older I get, the more
comfortable I'm gonna want it.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.300
Living this lifestyle,
you got to have

16:51.367 --> 16:53.800
a really strong foundation.
You got to be a rock.

16:53.867 --> 16:55.467
You're gonna get
your butt kicked,

16:55.533 --> 16:57.233
not just physically,
but mentally.

16:57.367 --> 16:58.733
Cold doesn't bother me.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.333
Yeah, I get cold,
but, you know,

17:01.433 --> 17:04.467
cold in Alaska
is like sunburn in Florida.

17:04.567 --> 17:07.067
Everybody gets it
and you learn to deal with it.

17:09.600 --> 17:10.933
Still pretty white out.

17:11.133 --> 17:13.767
Weather's starting to clear
to the south of me, here.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.000
I think I might pack up and

17:16.167 --> 17:17.700
move on down the trail

17:17.767 --> 17:20.333
and hopefully get into some
clearer weather to the south,

17:20.400 --> 17:22.800
and, uh,
get some glassing done.

17:22.967 --> 17:26.000
NARRATOR: Along
the Yukon River, Andy
is hunting caribou,

17:26.067 --> 17:28.200
a key food source
for winter survival.

17:28.300 --> 17:30.900
Whiteout conditions
force him to hunker down,

17:30.967 --> 17:33.833
but a break in the weather
has him back on the prowl.

17:34.200 --> 17:35.467
(ANDY SPEAKING)

17:37.900 --> 17:40.733
Toasty out here. Must be
up to five degrees now.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.533
Everything's relative
in Alaska.

17:44.467 --> 17:46.967
Could see
a lot of country from up here.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.600
Managed to make it
to this hillside

17:50.667 --> 17:52.000
where I've got some
pretty good glassing

17:52.067 --> 17:53.500
that cleared up a little bit.

17:54.167 --> 17:56.167
Now I'm hoping
I can spot some caribou

17:56.300 --> 17:58.767
somewhere in this country.
It's pretty hungry country.

17:59.033 --> 18:01.800
I guess I've always been very
comfortable being alone.

18:02.067 --> 18:04.367
I'm not lonely when I'm alone.

18:04.533 --> 18:06.500
You got to be comfortable
with yourself,

18:06.567 --> 18:08.633
and if you're comfortable
with yourself,

18:08.700 --> 18:10.800
that's the foundation
to making it

18:10.867 --> 18:11.900
living this lifestyle.

18:12.367 --> 18:14.867
There's a whole lot
of white out there

18:15.433 --> 18:18.000
and I'm just looking
for a few little browns.

18:18.267 --> 18:21.667
Weather cleared up,
I've had some pretty good
country to glass here,

18:21.733 --> 18:23.800
but I'm not seeing
anything real fresh.

18:23.933 --> 18:25.700
Eh, who knows,
maybe I'll ambush

18:25.767 --> 18:27.267
something on
the way home, too.

18:27.467 --> 18:29.533
Kind of got waylaid
by a whiteout,

18:29.600 --> 18:31.600
hunkered down for a while,
but it cleared up.

18:31.667 --> 18:34.233
It's pretty dark over
in that direction over there.

18:34.500 --> 18:35.700
To be on the safe side,

18:35.767 --> 18:39.100
I'm gonna get off
this mountain, head home.

18:39.167 --> 18:40.467
'Cause the last thing
I want to do is get

18:40.533 --> 18:41.700
stuck up here for a night.

18:41.767 --> 18:43.100
I'm not prepared for that.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.767
Mountains mean slopes.

18:44.833 --> 18:46.600
Sometimes slopes are gentle,

18:46.867 --> 18:49.367
and they're pretty easy to
negotiate with a snow machine,

18:49.433 --> 18:51.833
and other times
they're just steep as hell.

18:51.900 --> 18:53.733
As small as I am
on these newer machines,

18:53.800 --> 18:56.033
I have a really difficult
time on the side hills

18:56.100 --> 18:58.533
'cause I don't have enough
counterbalancing weight.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.667
I think side hilling
on a snow machine

19:00.733 --> 19:04.800
is probably the most
challenging condition
to do on a snow machine.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.500
This is raw country up here,
not a place to get stuck.

19:10.367 --> 19:11.433
Come on, baby!

19:13.800 --> 19:16.600
The end of the day
is always when shit happens.

19:16.667 --> 19:17.733
Came down a mountain,

19:17.933 --> 19:20.067
I got myself
into a bad position

19:20.133 --> 19:22.067
and I buried myself.

19:23.233 --> 19:25.167
I just basically bottomed out.

19:25.400 --> 19:29.000
So the snow machine's laying
in some deep snow here,

19:29.067 --> 19:30.400
and it's just
spinning the tracks.

19:30.467 --> 19:32.333
So I got to dig out
a little bit here

19:32.400 --> 19:33.800
and hopefully I can get
enough traction

19:33.867 --> 19:35.133
to get going again.

19:35.267 --> 19:36.933
Most of the time I'm alone,

19:37.000 --> 19:38.900
so if I get myself
into deep shit

19:38.967 --> 19:40.733
I got to get myself
out of deep shit.

19:43.667 --> 19:45.233
Well, I guess now
I'm glad I left

19:45.300 --> 19:46.633
a little bit before
it got dark.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.867
This wouldn't be any fun
to do this out in the dark.

19:52.367 --> 19:54.333
Must be right
at the edge of this trail

19:54.400 --> 19:56.800
where there's
a trick ditch or something.

19:56.967 --> 20:00.000
I'm 30 miles away from home.
I'm on the top of a mountain.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.800
If I can't get myself
out of here,

20:01.867 --> 20:04.300
it's a long walk home,
in the dark.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.000
Let's see what happens.

20:07.100 --> 20:08.167
(ENGINE STARTS)

20:09.767 --> 20:11.267
(ENGINE ROARS)

20:18.200 --> 20:20.767
Whoo-hoo. That was fun.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.467
Time to head home.

20:31.767 --> 20:33.433
SUE: I don't know
what comes next.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.433
But I'm gonna go
into it balls to the walls,

20:35.500 --> 20:37.833
flames in my hair
and full speed ahead.

20:39.533 --> 20:41.433
(ENGINE REVVING)

20:43.600 --> 20:46.633
NARRATOR: Sue's patrolling
her camp's perimeter
for signs of predators.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.367
It's her first time
on a snow machine

20:49.433 --> 20:51.633
since her accident
nearly a year ago

20:51.700 --> 20:55.033
and she must be careful not
to make another grave mistake.

20:55.400 --> 20:57.333
SUE: First time back
on the snow machine,

20:57.400 --> 21:00.000
I'm trying to keep
to an easier path,

21:00.200 --> 21:01.700
um, not real hectic.

21:01.767 --> 21:03.700
I need to overcome the fear.

21:03.767 --> 21:06.067
I need to get used
to the motion again,

21:06.167 --> 21:07.800
the lack of control.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.500
See what animal prints
are out there.

21:10.567 --> 21:13.300
I've got my
little .22 in the scabbard.

21:13.400 --> 21:16.067
I got some extra bullets
in my pocket just in case.

21:16.533 --> 21:18.633
There's a
series of tracks here

21:18.700 --> 21:20.633
and this is, uh, wolverine.

21:21.133 --> 21:24.667
How can I tell?
Size of the tracks.

21:24.733 --> 21:27.067
You know, that's a...
That's a big damn wolverine.

21:27.133 --> 21:29.533
Kavik means wolverine
in Eskimo.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.500
The river was named
because of the amount

21:31.567 --> 21:32.900
of wolverine on it.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.000
Only a pork chop

21:35.400 --> 21:37.567
goes after a wolverine
with a .22.

21:38.367 --> 21:40.800
So, what I think I'm gonna do
is, I'll get home,

21:40.867 --> 21:42.433
I'll grab the .30-30,

21:43.333 --> 21:46.200
and do the rest of
the perimeter with a .30-30.

21:52.333 --> 21:55.367
I don't want to go
plan for Armageddon,

21:55.933 --> 21:58.000
but this is a little .30-30,

21:58.133 --> 22:00.000
a little bit more bam.

22:00.067 --> 22:03.267
But I did see
really large wolverine print,

22:03.333 --> 22:05.133
more than one set.

22:05.233 --> 22:07.967
So, I'm gonna feel
more comfortable

22:08.033 --> 22:10.067
having a larger calibre rifle,

22:10.267 --> 22:13.833
with, uh, going in
and finishing out
more of the perimeter.

22:15.133 --> 22:16.800
No rest for the weary.

22:17.133 --> 22:18.900
Or was that the wicked?

22:26.600 --> 22:29.167
I've got to get back
to doing my perimeter check.

22:29.367 --> 22:31.700
But the goal for me today
really is,

22:31.800 --> 22:33.367
let's see

22:33.600 --> 22:36.033
how nervous being
on a machine makes me.

22:40.100 --> 22:41.867
I'm going very slow.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.367
And getting my feet wet.

22:44.433 --> 22:46.167
You know,
it's like almost drowning

22:46.233 --> 22:47.967
and getting back
in the water for a swim.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.533
You're probably gonna
do the dog paddle

22:49.600 --> 22:51.633
before you do the high dive.

23:11.267 --> 23:13.667
CHIP: I really like doing
this stuff. It's a living.

23:13.733 --> 23:15.467
It's natural, it's nature.

23:29.667 --> 23:31.500
That is good right there.

23:32.567 --> 23:34.633
Me and, uh, my daughter,
we brought out a
one-inch thick sheet

23:34.700 --> 23:36.667
of plywood out here.
It's 28 below.

23:36.967 --> 23:39.500
Took it out here.
Cut on the pattern
that I had drawn out.

23:39.567 --> 23:41.733
Now I've got the two sides
of what we're gonna make
into a form

23:41.800 --> 23:44.067
and I'm gonna put
pieces of wood on the inside,

23:44.133 --> 23:46.333
another piece of wood
on the outside of it,

23:46.400 --> 23:49.533
and when we go to bend
those runners that
are being steamed,

23:49.633 --> 23:51.100
they'll go into the end of it,

23:51.167 --> 23:52.367
and they won't be
able to lift out,

23:52.433 --> 23:54.233
and they'll sit inside
there until they dry.

23:54.300 --> 23:55.700
We're gonna reinforce
this a little bit, though,

23:55.767 --> 23:57.467
but for now we're gonna put
some nails in it.

24:14.067 --> 24:15.233
You're gonna take
that hot wood

24:15.300 --> 24:16.700
and put it up in here
like this

24:16.767 --> 24:18.900
and then it's gonna bend it
right along here,

24:18.967 --> 24:20.300
and it's gonna go
straight from there.

24:20.367 --> 24:23.133
The top is gonna hold this
while this gets torqued down.

24:23.500 --> 24:24.633
That's what we want.

24:25.367 --> 24:26.633
There's a big pot
of water over there.

24:26.700 --> 24:28.633
You want to go grab that
pot of water, dump it out,

24:28.700 --> 24:30.067
and then put it
back there again

24:30.133 --> 24:32.633
'cause it's gonna catch a...
Catch any water that goes out.

24:33.967 --> 24:35.467
Agnes is overseeing
the grandkids

24:35.533 --> 24:37.100
and sitting over
in Selawik right now,

24:37.167 --> 24:38.400
so me and my daughter
are totally

24:38.467 --> 24:40.133
wrecking this front room.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.033
She would put up
with me doing this,
but she wouldn't like it.

24:42.100 --> 24:43.533
But this is my house

24:43.600 --> 24:47.300
and it's 28 below zero outside
and it's 70 above up here,

24:47.367 --> 24:48.767
so it's almost
100 degrees difference,

24:48.933 --> 24:50.400
and this is the place to work.

24:50.867 --> 24:52.067
I'm gonna take this off.

24:52.133 --> 24:53.833
We'll take these
right off here. I want you to

24:53.900 --> 24:56.333
stay down here and keep it
from tipping and falling over

24:56.400 --> 24:59.167
and then I'll be able
to withdraw those woods
and put 'em in.

24:59.267 --> 25:00.700
This has been going for
quite a few hours,

25:00.767 --> 25:02.133
maybe more than
eight hours already.

25:02.433 --> 25:05.233
Longer it steams,
the better our chances
of doing it correctly.

25:05.433 --> 25:07.467
So, let's just see
what happens.

25:07.967 --> 25:09.100
No gloom and doom.

25:13.167 --> 25:14.333
(IRIQTAQ SPEAKING)

25:15.567 --> 25:17.567
Let's pull out these two,

25:17.633 --> 25:18.900
give 'em a bend.

25:23.400 --> 25:24.600
(GRUNTS)

25:26.233 --> 25:27.567
Pull out the other one, dear.

25:27.633 --> 25:29.067
Dad, this, um...

25:29.133 --> 25:30.133
Oh!

25:31.100 --> 25:33.200
We got to hurry though,
or we're gonna lose it.

25:36.033 --> 25:37.300
Right about there.

25:38.100 --> 25:40.267
Bring this up. Can you
bring this up? (GRUNTS)

25:42.600 --> 25:44.333
Okay... Fuck.

25:46.933 --> 25:48.567
-Tinmiaq!
-Whoa.

25:48.633 --> 25:51.433
-Tinmiaq!
-IRIQTAQ: Tinmiaq! Hurry up!

25:51.600 --> 25:54.433
Come here
and clamp these please, babe.

25:54.500 --> 25:55.567
-All the way down?
-Grab the clamp!

25:55.633 --> 25:57.767
Yep. Okay. Come on this
is gonna spring back up.

25:57.833 --> 25:59.133
We need to do this now.

25:59.467 --> 26:01.767
I didn't think this thing
was gonna lift you, Bun.

26:01.833 --> 26:04.933
Press the red button
for the clamp to go longer.

26:05.367 --> 26:07.733
These things are bending fine.
We're good.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.100
Ooh, yeah, there we go.

26:09.467 --> 26:11.733
You're good, thank you, Bun.
I need those big C-clamps.

26:11.800 --> 26:15.433
-Plastic or something.
-No, there's big metal ones
that were here somewhere.

26:16.733 --> 26:18.900
Look at the curve. Does that
look graceful to you?

26:18.967 --> 26:21.200
That looks good to me.
It's not too steep.

26:21.267 --> 26:22.733
It's got a long
angle of incident.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.533
We have just gotten
through the hardest part.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.233
What we need to do
is make sure these clamps

26:26.300 --> 26:28.900
are all on tight.
Make everything snug.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.233
Make sure nothing's broken.

26:30.367 --> 26:32.200
Let this thing dry
and set in place.

26:32.267 --> 26:34.000
These are gonna
be very durable.

26:34.100 --> 26:35.600
It's gonna be
a really nice sled.

26:37.367 --> 26:40.367
GLENN: I've never met a person
who saw this scene out here

26:40.433 --> 26:42.100
and didn't find it beautiful.

26:49.367 --> 26:51.300
Ten loads
to get that tree back

26:51.367 --> 26:52.567
and five miles of walking

26:52.633 --> 26:54.267
back and forth
to the wood cutting area.

26:54.333 --> 26:56.367
But the job's just begun.
Now I got to break it all up

26:56.433 --> 26:59.000
into small enough pieces
to fit it in my woodstove.

26:59.100 --> 27:00.367
So I better get started.

27:02.767 --> 27:05.100
In warmer weather,
I would saw this all up

27:05.167 --> 27:06.400
short enough
to fit in the stove.

27:06.467 --> 27:08.400
But I can take advantage
of the cold weather today.

27:08.467 --> 27:11.067
I can probably just split it
and smash it

27:11.167 --> 27:12.300
into small enough pieces

27:12.367 --> 27:14.200
that I can actually
put it in my stove.

27:14.267 --> 27:16.367
It'll be faster
and require less energy.

27:19.967 --> 27:21.667
When it's this cold,
why bother sawing it?

27:21.733 --> 27:22.967
You can just smash it up.

27:24.433 --> 27:25.967
I enjoy smashing firewood.

27:26.300 --> 27:28.133
It gets boring
just sawing all the time.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.067
Get it done
a little differently,

27:30.167 --> 27:32.833
get some aggression
out at the same time,
it's very therapeutic.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.133
Whatever the conditions are,
I take advantage of them.

27:50.200 --> 27:53.033
When it's really cold, wood
becomes much more brittle.

27:53.267 --> 27:55.533
I can split it,
just smash it up,

27:55.700 --> 27:59.333
rather than take all the time
to saw all the pieces down
to stove length.

28:04.067 --> 28:05.867
If it wasn't
for this spruce forest
right here around me,

28:05.933 --> 28:07.967
I wouldn't be able
to live here this way.

28:08.667 --> 28:11.033
But these trees, they give me
all the heat I need.

28:11.100 --> 28:14.733
Heat my cabin, cook my food,
heat my hot water.

28:14.967 --> 28:18.033
That's the basic
source of energy
out here for me.

28:18.633 --> 28:21.200
I had plenty of excitement
today, cutting this tree down.

28:21.267 --> 28:22.767
Quite a challenge.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.333
It's what keeps
life interesting,

28:24.400 --> 28:25.533
little challenges like that.

28:26.033 --> 28:28.333
Getting a difficult
tree back home,
cutting it all up

28:28.433 --> 28:30.000
and producing
enough firewood for myself

28:30.067 --> 28:31.200
to get me through
several more days.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.333
It can be physically
a lot of work,

28:35.400 --> 28:37.467
but it can just
be really enjoyable.

28:37.533 --> 28:40.233
Just because
of the environment it's in.

28:42.533 --> 28:46.033
Look at this,
this is beauty right here.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.500
And it puts you
in a different state of mind,

28:48.567 --> 28:50.733
when you're surrounded
by it every day.

28:55.533 --> 28:57.300
All right,
I got this whole tree

28:57.367 --> 28:59.867
reduced down
to stove-size wood.

28:59.933 --> 29:01.933
I'm gonna take some of it,
go in and stoke the fire

29:02.000 --> 29:03.700
and bake myself
a loaf of bread.

29:11.633 --> 29:14.567
ANDY: It's all a part
of creating the world
that you want to live in.

29:14.633 --> 29:16.267
I want to be able to get out
and continue doing

29:16.333 --> 29:18.833
the things that I love to do
out here all the time.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.667
Day two of caribou hunting.

29:25.733 --> 29:28.400
Hoping I can be a whole
lot more successful today.

29:28.467 --> 29:29.833
Got up early.

29:29.900 --> 29:32.367
Saw that it was gonna
be a bright blue sky day

29:32.433 --> 29:34.100
and I was
heading up for the summit.

29:39.033 --> 29:40.633
This looks like
a good place to glass.

29:40.700 --> 29:42.267
It's one of
my favourite spots.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.033
I got a nice out...

29:44.100 --> 29:45.833
Outcropping of rock
right here.

29:45.900 --> 29:48.067
I've got a pretty grand view.

29:48.133 --> 29:50.833
I'll be able to see 40 miles
away from here.

29:51.133 --> 29:52.467
Ah.

29:52.733 --> 29:54.700
Ooh, wait a minute.
Looks like a band of about

29:54.767 --> 29:57.200
six or eight, maybe 10.

29:59.733 --> 30:01.433
Got to almost ambush 'em.

30:01.833 --> 30:03.600
Got to watch 'em for a while,

30:03.667 --> 30:05.100
see which way
they're travelling.

30:05.167 --> 30:08.167
Try to get ahead of 'em
and let 'em walk right to you.

30:08.233 --> 30:11.433
Spotted some caribou,
just over the edge
of this ridge here.

30:11.667 --> 30:13.500
I don't know if they're gonna
go that way or this way,

30:13.600 --> 30:16.067
but I didn't want to get
the machine to close to 'em.

30:16.133 --> 30:17.900
You just never know
with caribou.

30:19.933 --> 30:21.767
So the caribou are
just over the hill.

30:21.833 --> 30:24.100
They're not more
than 150 yards away.

30:24.200 --> 30:27.300
It's really deep snow
and they're struggling
to come up the hill.

30:27.467 --> 30:29.533
This is where
the patience pays off.

30:29.767 --> 30:31.433
You don't want to shoot
one where it's bad

30:31.500 --> 30:32.800
for getting it out
'cause then you...

30:32.867 --> 30:34.567
You work three times harder.

Stop, die.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.667
All right, he's down.

30:52.500 --> 30:55.333
It was about
a 250, 300-yard shot,

30:55.833 --> 30:57.667
took down one.
That's all I needed.

30:58.267 --> 31:00.433
I got plenty more meat now
for the rest of the winter.

31:00.867 --> 31:03.900
Been five or six months since
I've had some fresh meat.

31:04.067 --> 31:06.067
I'm already starting to drool.

31:06.133 --> 31:07.333
All right.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.067
Got some 'bou.

31:11.800 --> 31:14.333
My time's gonna
be better spent

31:14.400 --> 31:16.000
getting this caribou
in my sled.

31:16.433 --> 31:18.700
I can wrap him up,
take him home,

31:18.900 --> 31:21.033
then I can take care
of him really good,

31:21.633 --> 31:23.733
at home,
where it's a lot warmer.

31:23.800 --> 31:25.867
This is what you call
dead weight. (GROANS)

31:25.933 --> 31:27.333
Come on, big baby.

31:27.933 --> 31:28.967
Argh!

31:31.000 --> 31:32.133
All right.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.633
This caribou's probably

31:34.100 --> 31:36.200
350, 400 pounds, maybe.

31:45.633 --> 31:47.733
That moon is coming in fast.

31:48.633 --> 31:51.600
No time to
piss around right now.

31:51.933 --> 31:55.733
Doesn't take long when
the wind starts blowing
and the sun goes away.

32:05.067 --> 32:07.067
SUE: We're all on the same
damn globe spinning around.

32:07.133 --> 32:08.667
It's gonna be
a happier journey

32:08.733 --> 32:10.467
if we're all nicer
to each other.

32:16.300 --> 32:18.167
That's a big ass
pressure ridge.

32:20.767 --> 32:23.167
What this is,
is a big old pressure ridge.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.567
The water...
We're on the Kavik River.

32:25.633 --> 32:28.500
The water finds
the weak spots in the ice.

32:28.900 --> 32:32.500
Builds up pressure, pools,
builds up, pools, builds up.

32:32.567 --> 32:35.967
You get a big ridge, or a zit,
like this is,

32:36.033 --> 32:38.033
and then at some point...

32:38.100 --> 32:39.333
(IMITATES EXPLOSION)

32:39.533 --> 32:42.833
It blows. That's where
overflow comes from.

32:42.900 --> 32:45.300
It creates a very
slick form of ice

32:45.433 --> 32:47.600
and that's what
caught me last year was...

32:47.667 --> 32:50.900
It's like putting WD-40 on ice

32:51.233 --> 32:55.333
and you're suddenly
not in control.

32:55.500 --> 32:56.800
Nature is.

32:57.133 --> 33:00.633
And nature... Nature can be
a motherfucker. (CHUCKLES)

33:03.433 --> 33:07.667
I learned a lesson last year
about the overflow,

33:07.733 --> 33:09.433
and how slick
it makes the ice.

33:09.500 --> 33:12.333
So, I am now getting a little
out of my comfort zone.

33:15.433 --> 33:17.833
I've still got to get
my perimeter check done,

33:17.900 --> 33:19.867
whether I'm
comfortable with it or not.

33:22.300 --> 33:23.900
So I've gone every direction.

33:23.967 --> 33:25.233
The last direction to go

33:25.300 --> 33:27.600
is this way towards
the river and back in,

33:27.667 --> 33:29.533
uh, and that'll take
me right by the...

33:29.600 --> 33:31.933
The scene of the crime.
The scene of the accident

33:32.367 --> 33:36.267
and, uh, I want to see what
that area's looking like now.

33:36.333 --> 33:37.867
I need to see
what kind of shape it's in

33:37.933 --> 33:40.467
and I need to put the, uh...
I need to put the fear of

33:40.567 --> 33:42.667
that whole incident to bed.

33:50.567 --> 33:52.867
CHIP: In the life that
we lead, in the environment
that we're in,

33:52.933 --> 33:55.833
you need specially adapted
and specially developed stuff.

34:10.433 --> 34:12.333
We do this
and we get the bottoms fitted

34:12.400 --> 34:14.467
and we have the,
um, stanchions

34:14.533 --> 34:16.733
fitted perfectly
to the runners.

34:16.800 --> 34:18.267
Then we're gonna make
the crosspieces here

34:18.400 --> 34:20.367
and we're gonna make
the end pieces

34:20.433 --> 34:23.100
and we're gonna start
to make sure that these things
are the exact same distance

34:23.167 --> 34:24.800
and tie the two together.

34:25.600 --> 34:28.533
CHIP: I like making sleds.
This is fun, to me, usually.

34:29.033 --> 34:31.700
This is something I do
with my kids running
all around, no problem.

34:31.900 --> 34:33.633
They observed me
for a lot of the years
doing this stuff.

34:33.700 --> 34:34.933
They know the value of them.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.767
Itty Bitty's interested,
and she's physically able.

34:41.300 --> 34:42.833
By participating,

34:42.900 --> 34:44.400
putting their hands on it,

34:44.467 --> 34:46.433
making mistakes,
screwing stuff up,

34:46.500 --> 34:48.367
they learn. 'Cause you learn
from your mistakes.

34:48.467 --> 34:49.800
So we give 'em
the opportunity to learn.

34:49.900 --> 34:51.900
I'm glad she's old enough
and helpful enough here

34:51.967 --> 34:53.433
that she's gonna
help me out like this.

34:53.933 --> 34:55.567
(BANGING)

34:56.067 --> 34:57.733
See how they're
absolutely flat now?

34:57.800 --> 35:00.367
This one has to come up,
it's got more to go.

35:00.633 --> 35:03.200
Argh! Fuck me running mad.

35:03.367 --> 35:06.000
Wow! I felt like
I punched a wall just now.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.133
(WHIRRING)

35:13.500 --> 35:14.767
Feel that smooth?

35:14.833 --> 35:16.433
This will last usually
about three to five years.

35:16.500 --> 35:17.933
We use 'em heavily.

35:18.033 --> 35:19.600
When I'm not using it,
one of my kids will use it,

35:19.667 --> 35:21.033
my wife will use it.

35:21.100 --> 35:22.600
Feel like my wife
will use this a lot more,

35:22.667 --> 35:25.533
she prefers a light sled
and she travels
with the kids a lot

35:25.600 --> 35:27.133
and usually I'm the one
with the heavy sled

35:27.200 --> 35:28.500
'cause I'm looking for a load.

35:28.567 --> 35:30.300
I'm looking for firewood,
I'm looking for caribou,

35:30.367 --> 35:31.533
I'm looking for gasoline.

35:31.667 --> 35:34.300
So, more or less
this is for Agnes. (CHUCKLES)

35:34.533 --> 35:37.233
IRIQTAQ: I love
to travel actually.
I love the trails,

35:37.300 --> 35:40.267
I love taking people along,
I love meeting new people

35:40.333 --> 35:42.767
and using a basket sled
is one way I can do that.

35:42.833 --> 35:45.900
Knowing how to repair
and fix one is very important,

35:45.967 --> 35:48.600
because some day it
may just be me on the trail.

35:51.133 --> 35:52.133
(IRIQTAQ SPEAKING)

35:56.267 --> 35:57.633
CHIP: Me and my daughter,
Itty Bitty,

35:57.700 --> 36:00.033
we took advantage
of the time we had,

36:00.100 --> 36:01.967
and I showed her
how to take a plank,

36:02.033 --> 36:04.633
and saw it up into pieces
and assemble those pieces.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.433
I like to show my daughter
how to make things

36:06.500 --> 36:09.067
and do things
and she's watched me
plenty of times before

36:09.200 --> 36:10.733
and now she's actually
put her hands on

36:11.067 --> 36:12.200
and helped me make this.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.700
What do you think, huh?

36:13.833 --> 36:15.333
It looks beautiful out here.

36:15.433 --> 36:17.400
In a short time
we took that from a plank,

36:17.467 --> 36:19.033
to a functional piece of art.

36:19.100 --> 36:21.400
I like it. Your mum will be
surprised when she gets back.

36:21.567 --> 36:24.267
It's nice to know that
growing up with somebody

36:24.333 --> 36:27.567
that takes the time
to teach us basic information

36:27.633 --> 36:30.133
and knowledge that we need
to live around here.

36:30.267 --> 36:32.467
Really impressive
and I love growing up

36:32.533 --> 36:34.367
with a father
that does that for me.

36:40.433 --> 36:41.567
ANDY: For me, money out here,

36:41.800 --> 36:43.967
the only thing it's good for
is fire starter.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.433
Time to throw
this baby on the fire.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.433
It's a good day when
you can come home
with 350 pounds of meat.

37:02.633 --> 37:05.100
Learn to love the feeling,
at the end of the day,

37:05.367 --> 37:06.967
when you walk in

37:07.033 --> 37:09.000
and you're tired,
and you're hungry,

37:09.067 --> 37:11.033
and you're cold,
and you're wet,

37:11.100 --> 37:13.967
to realise that, hey, man,
I got something done today

37:14.033 --> 37:15.167
and I did it for me.

37:16.300 --> 37:17.800
Oh, yeah!

37:18.633 --> 37:20.367
Taking the time
to go do all this,

37:20.433 --> 37:22.533
is a lot of hard work,

37:22.600 --> 37:26.900
but, uh, Confucius once said
that a man who loves his work
never works a day in his life.

37:27.633 --> 37:29.400
And that's kind
of the way my life is.

37:29.767 --> 37:31.267
I love doing what I do.

37:31.667 --> 37:34.933
It's a lot of hard work,
but it doesn't feel like work.

37:35.733 --> 37:36.933
Worth it.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.567
Oh, my God.

37:39.833 --> 37:40.933
Yeah!

37:42.433 --> 37:47.233
This was worth 120 miles
and two days' work.

37:47.667 --> 37:49.467
That is a good caribou.

37:50.800 --> 37:53.200
Good sustenance. Good life.

37:54.033 --> 37:55.200
Good night.

37:57.533 --> 37:59.267
GLENN: Now there are
a lot of things
I have to give up

37:59.333 --> 38:01.000
to live by myself out
in the wilderness.

38:01.067 --> 38:03.900
I have to go long periods
without seeing another person.

38:12.033 --> 38:13.633
I worked up an appetite

38:13.700 --> 38:16.500
getting that
firewood back here
and getting it all split up.

38:16.567 --> 38:18.967
So what I'm gonna do now, is
bake myself a loaf of bread.

38:19.100 --> 38:21.133
I don't have an oven,
but I don't need an oven.

38:21.267 --> 38:22.900
I can get by
with just a couple of pans,

38:22.967 --> 38:25.267
a little trick I figured
out years ago.

38:25.633 --> 38:27.633
So I'm gonna make my bread
right on my woodstove.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.633
Some flour,

38:29.700 --> 38:31.067
a little bit of salt.

38:31.567 --> 38:32.800
Okay, I'm gonna
put the yeast in.

38:32.867 --> 38:34.067
I like to keep
it pretty simple.

38:34.500 --> 38:36.733
Just flour, salt, yeast,

38:36.967 --> 38:38.333
some warm water.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.067
That'll make
a nice loaf of bread.

38:40.167 --> 38:42.100
I always like to eat
healthy food.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.100
Who wants to put junk
into your body?

38:44.167 --> 38:45.833
I like to keep healthy.
Out here,

38:46.033 --> 38:47.800
in order to do the work
I do, in order

38:47.867 --> 38:49.600
to run around these mountains,
I got to stay in shape.

38:49.667 --> 38:51.767
I got to stay healthy,
so I eat healthy food.

38:51.833 --> 38:54.433
Listen to your body.
You start eating healthy food,

38:54.800 --> 38:57.233
your body feels better.
You have more energy.

38:57.300 --> 39:00.567
Get out there and work harder,
just feel better overall.

39:02.033 --> 39:03.733
You buy a loaf bread
in the store

39:03.933 --> 39:05.800
and you just don't have
the same relationship with it.

39:05.867 --> 39:07.433
You didn't handle it yourself,

39:07.500 --> 39:10.533
you didn't feel that dough
between your fingers.

39:11.367 --> 39:13.500
You didn't smell
that bread rising.

39:13.800 --> 39:16.200
And that's what I like
about making bread.

39:16.733 --> 39:18.733
Living this lifestyle here

39:18.867 --> 39:20.633
affords one the opportunity

39:21.300 --> 39:24.133
to eat healthy food,
to make their own food.

39:24.200 --> 39:26.400
There's time. A lot of foods,

39:26.467 --> 39:29.067
you have to pay
conscious attention to 'em.

39:29.133 --> 39:30.767
If you're baking
bread from scratch,

39:30.833 --> 39:33.233
you have to pay attention
to it. You can't just

39:33.400 --> 39:35.233
throw it over in the corner
and forget about it.

39:35.300 --> 39:36.600
You gotta be around
while it's rising.

39:36.667 --> 39:38.433
You got to make sure
the temperature's good.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.200
You got to take care of it.

39:40.567 --> 39:42.200
My bread's gonna rise.
Over the woodstove

39:42.267 --> 39:44.900
it's gonna get a nice,
warm updraught.

39:45.567 --> 39:47.400
And after some time goes by,

39:47.500 --> 39:49.867
I'll notice it, I'll smell it,
and I'll come up
and I'll check.

39:56.667 --> 39:58.333
Time to check the bread.

39:59.467 --> 40:00.833
Wow, look at that.

40:00.933 --> 40:02.533
The bread's all risen, okay.

40:02.667 --> 40:04.067
Time to put it in the oven.

40:04.133 --> 40:05.667
Only thing is,
I don't have an oven.

40:05.800 --> 40:09.033
What I've got is a woodstove,
so I just take a big pan,

40:09.200 --> 40:11.100
put a little water
in the bottom.

40:11.233 --> 40:13.500
I'll just set my little pan
with the bread dough,

40:13.633 --> 40:15.100
down inside of there.

40:15.167 --> 40:17.067
(BOILING)

40:18.533 --> 40:21.633
212-degree oven, it'll just
steam bake it in there.

40:21.700 --> 40:23.933
Nothing like the smell
of baking bread.

40:29.200 --> 40:30.267
All right,
the bread's smelling good.

40:30.333 --> 40:31.800
I bet it's done.

40:32.133 --> 40:33.633
I'll take it out and check.

40:34.200 --> 40:35.533
Oh, yeah.

40:36.733 --> 40:38.033
Look at this.

40:38.633 --> 40:40.933
Wow. Look at that
beautiful loaf of bread.

40:41.233 --> 40:44.767
All it took
was a little bit of time,
some flour

40:45.167 --> 40:47.867
and some firewood from
that tree I cut down today.

40:52.100 --> 40:53.600
Mmm-mmm.

40:54.167 --> 40:55.367
Delicious.

40:55.467 --> 40:57.300
No better way to end
a long day of cutting firewood

40:57.367 --> 40:59.933
than to sit down
and eat a loaf of bread.

41:06.300 --> 41:08.067
SUE: Everybody has their own
personal journey in life.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.200
I am who I am
and I like who I am.

41:21.133 --> 41:23.433
It's almost exactly one year
since I got hurt,

41:23.500 --> 41:26.033
and the conditions
are pretty damn similar.

41:26.167 --> 41:27.833
This is overflow.

41:27.900 --> 41:30.933
It is dangerous,
as I found out last year.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.900
I didn't give it
the proper respect and

41:33.000 --> 41:35.733
it, uh... It bitch-slapped me
into next week.

41:39.367 --> 41:40.700
Unfortunately,

41:40.767 --> 41:43.533
I hit the patch
that was solid ice

41:43.867 --> 41:46.233
and went into
an unrecoverable side-slide.

41:47.433 --> 41:48.533
Boom.

41:49.733 --> 41:51.467
I was ejected
and then, kind of,

41:51.533 --> 41:52.667
tuck-and-rolled a little bit,

41:52.733 --> 41:54.867
only I forgot
the whole tuck part.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.767
You know, there's a part of me
that kind of wants to cry.

41:57.833 --> 42:00.633
I lost a whole year that
I really didn't want to lose.

42:00.767 --> 42:03.800
I can to this day remember
how much pain I was in.

42:03.867 --> 42:06.367
What I'm dealing with now is,

42:06.433 --> 42:09.533
I now have a facet of my life
that gives me fear.

42:09.867 --> 42:11.533
I don't much care for that.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.867
So I know
I need to work on it.

42:14.200 --> 42:17.867
I know I have my own
ownership in what happened.

42:18.567 --> 42:22.133
No matter what happens,
you have your part
to play in it.

42:22.433 --> 42:23.800
Own it. Take it.

42:23.933 --> 42:25.900
Make out with it.
Be comfortable with it.

42:25.967 --> 42:27.267
Get past it.

42:27.833 --> 42:30.000
I have developed a fear,

42:30.667 --> 42:33.367
but I can't let it beat me.

42:33.733 --> 42:35.467
You know, you can't circumvent

42:35.533 --> 42:38.367
all of the things
you do wrong in your life.

42:42.033 --> 42:44.700
But it's my nature
to come back and say,

42:44.767 --> 42:45.933
"Here, bitches.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.267
"Still here.

42:48.100 --> 42:50.100
"Didn't get me." (LAUGHS)

43:02.467 --> 43:04.133
Time to move on.

43:04.300 --> 43:06.200
Go forward, not in reverse.
