00:02.040 --> 00:03.474
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:03.560 --> 00:05.199
<i>You're no longer you.</i>

00:05.280 --> 00:07.590
<i>You're a part
of a negative force.</i>

00:07.680 --> 00:10.593
Thawne's Speed Force
is fueled by negative emotions.

00:10.680 --> 00:11.736
- What do you do?
- Trust me,

00:11.760 --> 00:13.096
you wouldn't believe
me if I told you.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.794
You're not super satisfied
with your secret identity.

00:15.880 --> 00:18.156
Are you saying
I don't want to be Vibe?

00:18.240 --> 00:20.277
<i>There won't be any future
for any metas</i>

00:20.360 --> 00:21.794
<i>if we don't get rid
of that dagger.</i>

00:21.880 --> 00:23.758
<i>If anything's gonna
destroy that dagger,</i>

00:23.840 --> 00:24.840
<i>it's this Mirror Gun.</i>

00:24.880 --> 00:25.916
It works.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.480
Follow my instructions

00:27.560 --> 00:28.596
<i>and we'll defeat Cicada,</i>

00:28.680 --> 00:29.680
<i>destroy her dagger,</i>

00:29.760 --> 00:30.876
<i>and save your father.</i>

00:30.960 --> 00:33.350
Thawne is manipulating her.

00:33.440 --> 00:36.080
<i>He's on death row.
How is he manipulating her?</i>

00:36.160 --> 00:37.514
<i>Something doesn't add up.</i>

00:37.640 --> 00:39.279
The dagger
is Thawne's plan.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.518
Don't shoot it!

00:44.600 --> 00:47.115
<i>I always wanted
to be a hero,</i>

00:47.200 --> 00:52.150
<i>to use my extraordinary
abilities to help people.</i>

00:52.280 --> 00:54.078
<i>That's why I came here.</i>

00:54.160 --> 00:57.995
<i>To meet my family,
to stop Cicada,</i>

00:58.080 --> 01:00.197
<i>help fix
the Flash's legacy,</i>

01:00.280 --> 01:02.920
<i>and save him from
disappearing in the future.</i>

01:03.040 --> 01:06.078
<i>I believed I could
do the impossible,</i>

01:06.160 --> 01:09.358
<i>but I never imagined
it would turn out like this.</i>

01:20.520 --> 01:22.637
No, no!
What's he doing?

01:34.480 --> 01:40.192
Cicada... Thawne,
dagger.

01:50.680 --> 01:51.875
<i>How's Ralph?</i>

01:51.960 --> 01:53.016
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:53.040 --> 01:54.360
I can't quite figure it out.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.397
His cells are
kinetically inverted.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.616
It's like they're
the reverse of themselves.

01:57.640 --> 01:59.336
I should've spent more time
trying to figure out

01:59.360 --> 02:00.760
how this thing works.

02:00.840 --> 02:02.336
I just don't understand
why he would jump

02:02.360 --> 02:03.589
in front of that blast.

02:03.680 --> 02:04.776
I mean, why would
he do that?

02:04.800 --> 02:06.678
That's the question,
isn't it?

02:06.760 --> 02:09.354
That's the question.

02:09.479 --> 02:12.871
In other news,
Cicada deuce is still MIA.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.496
All right,
we should get to CCPD,

02:14.520 --> 02:17.080
see if we can find anything
that could help us track her.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.034
What?

02:23.160 --> 02:24.958
I'm supposed to meet up
with Kamilla later.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.696
I thought things were going
really well for you two.

02:26.720 --> 02:28.074
They are.

02:28.160 --> 02:30.470
I just haven't told her about

02:30.560 --> 02:32.677
my vibratory alter ego yet.

02:32.760 --> 02:35.514
Cisco, if you're serious
about being with her,

02:35.600 --> 02:37.193
you have to tell
her the truth.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.793
I know.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.674
All the metas that we
couldn't cure,

02:43.760 --> 02:45.991
we got safely evacuated,
and they're waiting

02:46.080 --> 02:47.753
at a protected
holding facility.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.513
Nice work, both of you.

02:49.600 --> 02:50.760
Well the work's not done yet.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.200
I mean, the metas
are safe for now,

02:52.280 --> 02:53.600
but Cicada's still out there,

02:53.680 --> 02:55.114
so the people
are still in danger.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.759
Fill me in
on the details.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.116
I'm ready for
this nightmare to end.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.993
It should've been
over already.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.594
Nora, look,

03:02.680 --> 03:05.115
I'm sure Ralph
had a good reason.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.112
Until we figure out
what it is, we just gotta

03:07.200 --> 03:09.112
concentrate on this,
all right?

03:12.120 --> 03:13.270
Wait a second.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.233
What is that?

03:19.360 --> 03:20.589
Looks like wood.

03:20.720 --> 03:21.720
From what?

03:21.721 --> 03:23.074
I mean, the floor is marble,

03:23.160 --> 03:24.355
furniture's untouched,

03:24.440 --> 03:26.120
and the skylight's made
of glass and metal.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.270
Well if it didn't come

03:27.360 --> 03:28.600
from Cicada's point of entry...

03:28.680 --> 03:31.479
She must've brought
it from somewhere else.

03:31.560 --> 03:33.074
<i>What do we do now?</i>

03:33.160 --> 03:35.516
You know what to do.

03:35.600 --> 03:39.071
Hit them when they
least expect it.

03:39.160 --> 03:41.516
When they least
expect it.

03:44.440 --> 03:45.760
The Time Sphere.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.240
If I repair it,

03:47.320 --> 03:49.357
I can bring the
last of the virus back

03:49.440 --> 03:51.716
to the night
of the Particle Accelerator.

03:51.800 --> 03:56.158
When meta-humans first
appeared in Central City...

03:56.240 --> 03:59.233
And the Flash becomes
a hero to stop me.

03:59.320 --> 04:04.111
<i>Destroy the meta-humans
before they destroy the world.</i>

04:04.200 --> 04:08.638
They'll be born
only to die.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.517
Definitely some
kind of wood fragment.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.115
And you think those will lead
us to where Cicada's hiding?

04:15.200 --> 04:16.475
We can find out.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.233
We can cross-reference this,
see what kind of wood it is,

04:19.360 --> 04:20.839
then see where we end up.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.558
Is there any
progress on Ralph?

04:24.640 --> 04:26.456
No, he's still unconscious,
and I can't figure out

04:26.480 --> 04:28.199
a way to reverse his cells.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.936
So I guess that means we
still don't know why

04:29.960 --> 04:31.696
he jumped in front
of that Mirror Gun, do we?

04:31.720 --> 04:33.154
We do.

04:34.480 --> 04:35.480
We do...

04:35.560 --> 04:38.394
because Dibny solved
the greatest mystery of all.

04:38.480 --> 04:41.314
The Flash legacy,
how to stop Cicada,

04:41.400 --> 04:43.551
repentance for his past sins...

04:43.640 --> 04:46.314
all the reasons
Eobard Thawne was helping you.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.835
And stopping Dad
from disappearing in the future.

04:48.920 --> 04:50.720
Disappearing in the future
is part of it, hmm?

04:50.800 --> 04:53.031
But this has nothing
to do with your father.

04:53.120 --> 04:57.399
The real reason that Thawne
wishes to defeat Cicada

04:57.480 --> 04:59.915
and destroy Cicada's dagger

05:00.000 --> 05:02.640
is because this dagger

05:02.720 --> 05:06.077
is the only thing keeping
the Reverse-Flash in prison.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.755
Guess this is it.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.071
Looks like it,
doesn't it?

05:18.160 --> 05:19.594
Mm.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.712
I almost forgot.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.757
I contacted the Flash Museum,

05:30.840 --> 05:33.912
had them send
something over for today.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.390
I thought it should
be buried for good...

05:36.520 --> 05:37.840
along with you.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.679
Consider it
a parting gift.

05:53.800 --> 05:57.589
Destroying Cicada's
dagger in the past

05:57.680 --> 06:00.400
will save Thawne
from dying in the future?

06:00.480 --> 06:01.755
That's right.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.553
Cicada's dagger
has been dampening

06:03.640 --> 06:05.597
Thawne's powers
all this time.

06:05.680 --> 06:08.195
So if we get rid
of the dagger now,

06:08.280 --> 06:09.555
it disappears
in the future?

06:09.680 --> 06:11.239
And Thawne gets out
of Iron Heights.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.152
A reverse time hack.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.516
Everything you said
about Thawne is true.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.274
The only person
he ever helps is himself.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.496
Nora, this is not your fault.

06:19.520 --> 06:20.874
Yes, it is.

06:25.240 --> 06:28.039
Now, the question
we have to ask...

06:28.120 --> 06:32.194
do we stop Cicada
or do we stop Thawne?

06:32.280 --> 06:34.476
No, we're not gonna let
thousands of meta-humans die,

06:34.560 --> 06:36.153
now or in the future.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.390
We find Cicada.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.234
We destroy the dagger
once and for all.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.475
You gotta get
out of here.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.597
No, we gotta wait
for the results...

06:48.680 --> 06:50.433
We can handle
it until you get back.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.273
Go see Kamilla.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.360
How do you choose?

07:06.440 --> 07:09.638
That's more of a question
for Iris than for me.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.234
Hey.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.789
Hey.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.714
She seems to be happy
with my photos.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.837
I was kinda hoping
she'd send me over to CCPD

07:18.920 --> 07:20.400
to take photos of
the meta-humans

07:20.480 --> 07:21.616
when they were
getting that cure.

07:21.640 --> 07:25.316
Can you imagine being there
when that Cicada guy attacked?

07:25.400 --> 07:28.313
Cicada woman, actually.

07:29.440 --> 07:30.635
A woman?

07:34.920 --> 07:37.310
Her name's
Grace Gibbons.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.074
Her uncle was
the first Cicada.

07:40.160 --> 07:44.234
She killed him after he took
the meta-human cure.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.319
The cure that I made.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.312
The cure you made?

07:54.040 --> 07:56.635
You're serious.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.360
That's the scientific project
you've been working on?

07:59.440 --> 08:02.194
At S.T.A.R. Labs.

08:02.280 --> 08:06.069
You never told me your lab
was S.T.A.R. Labs.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.951
There's a lot
I haven't told you.

08:09.040 --> 08:11.077
What is that
supposed to mean?

08:31.560 --> 08:33.153
You're Vibe.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.953
Look, Kamilla,

08:42.080 --> 08:44.834
I've seen firsthand
how hard it is

08:44.960 --> 08:47.680
to have two lives
like this.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.433
And I tried to separate
you from that,

08:49.520 --> 08:53.070
but I don't want to keep
this from you anymore.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.800
I can't keep lying
to you like this.

08:55.880 --> 08:58.156
I'm sorry.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.597
I'm sorry.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.313
Cisco, wait.

09:07.560 --> 09:09.517
I totally get it.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.717
I've read a lot
of comic books.

09:11.800 --> 09:14.315
I know all the tropes
that go with

09:14.400 --> 09:16.551
revealing secret
identities.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.439
But in real life,
I would never expect you

09:19.520 --> 09:21.477
to tell me something
like this right away.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.400
You're amazing,
you know that?

09:27.480 --> 09:29.870
Cisco, this isn't
about me.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.394
It's about you.

09:31.480 --> 09:35.110
If being Vibe is a part
of the life you want,

09:35.200 --> 09:37.192
I would never get
in the way of that.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.992
You know,
you really are a lot like me.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.072
Trusting.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.320
And you always blame yourself
when things go wrong.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.477
How do I fix this?

09:50.560 --> 09:53.155
I don't know
if you can, Nora.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.837
You made a mistake,

09:56.920 --> 09:58.798
you know?

09:58.880 --> 10:01.031
A big mistake.

10:01.160 --> 10:03.880
Sometimes in life,
all we can do is just

10:03.960 --> 10:05.917
live with the consequences.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.350
So what you have to ask
yourself is

10:08.440 --> 10:10.750
what kind of hero
are you gonna be?

10:10.880 --> 10:14.715
One who takes a do-over
after every mistake,

10:14.840 --> 10:18.880
or one who lives with it
and moves forward?

10:37.440 --> 10:38.715
Nothing?

10:38.800 --> 10:41.156
Nope, I still cannot
figure out how to reset

10:41.240 --> 10:42.240
his cells back
to normal.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.595
He's till Humpty Dumpty'd,
huh?

10:43.680 --> 10:44.909
Yep.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.096
He hasn't been
this much of a mess

10:46.120 --> 10:48.032
since he first got his powers.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.271
Since...

10:50.360 --> 10:53.194
And what did you do
to help him then?

10:53.280 --> 10:55.636
We introduced a stabilizing
enzyme that reset

10:55.720 --> 10:58.997
his body back to its original
form using vulcanization...

10:59.080 --> 11:00.080
and muscle memory.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.600
Muscle memory.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.155
Well then, it appears
all that we need to do

11:04.240 --> 11:05.310
is wake him up.

11:05.400 --> 11:06.680
How would you
suggest we do that?

11:06.760 --> 11:08.080
Simple.

11:09.560 --> 11:10.676
We blast him.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.319
We blast him?

11:12.440 --> 11:15.512
If you blast him,
right, the vibrational jolt,

11:15.600 --> 11:18.957
it will be more than enough
to kick-start his consciousness.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.235
I'm sure of it.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.470
Can't we just play some Gaga

11:21.560 --> 11:22.630
and hope he wakes up?

11:22.720 --> 11:24.473
Gaga is not the solution
to everything.

11:24.560 --> 11:25.710
You have to blast him.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.096
<i>Allez,</i> young Ralph Macchio,
please.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.316
Be careful.
This could get a little ugly.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.632
Okay.

11:33.720 --> 11:35.916
Sorry, deuce.

11:45.640 --> 11:48.109
WrestleMania!

11:48.800 --> 11:51.031
VoilÃ !
Good as new.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.520
Blasted why
you happen what?

11:52.600 --> 11:53.600
Hmm?

11:53.680 --> 11:55.911
B-b-blasted why
you happen what?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.200
Except for
the language skills.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.670
Those will return,
probably.

12:01.640 --> 12:02.640
Come on.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.000
Everybody going,
where is?

12:04.040 --> 12:06.271
Everybody going
where... every...

12:07.560 --> 12:08.560
What is it?

12:08.640 --> 12:10.016
It's the wood particles
you guys found.

12:10.040 --> 12:11.110
Swiss ash.

12:11.200 --> 12:14.079
Part of the flowering ash trees
indigenous to Europe,

12:14.160 --> 12:16.231
but also make up
our biggest wood space

12:16.320 --> 12:18.596
not 12 miles
from Central City.

12:18.680 --> 12:19.909
Kolins Woods.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.176
That's where Cicada
almost killed me.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.856
That's also one of the
largest wooded parks

12:22.880 --> 12:24.473
in the country.
We need a better plan.

12:24.560 --> 12:25.835
I've got one...

12:26.920 --> 12:29.594
that can stop
Cicada and Thawne.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.756
Out to sniff? So really
we're using her Cecile?

12:37.840 --> 12:40.196
Well, she is a highly
sensitive empath

12:40.320 --> 12:42.357
and Cicada emanates hate.

12:42.440 --> 12:43.874
DA Cecile Horton will serve

12:43.960 --> 12:46.873
as our early warning
detection system.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.429
If we're lucky,
Cicada won't see what's coming.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.876
<i>Then once we find Cicada Il
and trap her,</i>

12:51.960 --> 12:54.031
we give Young Grace
the choice to take the cure.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.396
And hopefully, when
she's no longer a meta...

12:56.480 --> 12:57.709
That bitch will
cease to exist.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.554
That way we can stop her
without destroying the dagger

13:00.640 --> 13:02.233
and Thawne never goes free.

13:02.320 --> 13:03.616
Now all you have
to do is help Grace

13:03.640 --> 13:04.640
make the right choice.

13:04.760 --> 13:06.160
What do I say?

13:06.240 --> 13:08.197
Whatever's in your heart.
She'll listen.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.033
What a bunch
of sentimental crap.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.396
You two sound like
a friggin' Hallmark movie.

13:12.520 --> 13:13.795
I hear ya, sister.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.473
I think we're close.

13:15.560 --> 13:16.520
You good?

13:17.600 --> 13:19.751
Oh, yeah, jeez, sorry.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.672
Uh, this way.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.352
Here we go.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.111
The Sphere is ready.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.356
We can leave.

13:37.280 --> 13:39.397
Guys, we found her.
Get ready.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.954
I'm actually glad
you found me before we left.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.918
Now I can end your lives
twice today.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.912
Not on my watch.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.512
- We got her.
- Nora, you're up.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.160
If you can connect
to Grace as an adult,

14:05.280 --> 14:06.576
you can connect
with her as a child.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.671
You just have to tap
into her anger.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.114
You can do this.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.313
You shouldn't
have come back here, Nora.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.629
I had to, Grace,

14:34.720 --> 14:36.960
because a lot of people are
gonna die unless you help me.

14:37.040 --> 14:41.034
If I can help it,
you'll be the first to die.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.513
Uh, the force field's integrity

14:44.600 --> 14:47.434
just went down to 86 percent.

14:47.520 --> 14:51.036
Grace, I know you think your
uncle wanted all metas dead,

14:51.160 --> 14:52.514
but he was a meta.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.000
That's why he took the cure

14:54.120 --> 14:55.520
and why he wants you
to have it too.

14:55.560 --> 14:58.155
You're a meta,
just like your uncle.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.879
No I'm not!
Take it back.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.237
70 percent... 52...

15:07.320 --> 15:09.880
Don't listen to her,
Gracie.

15:09.960 --> 15:12.156
This hate.
It's consuming you,

15:12.240 --> 15:13.799
turning you
into a monster.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.190
And what's worse,
you're all alone.

15:16.280 --> 15:17.953
Uncle Orlin
wouldn't leave me.

15:18.040 --> 15:19.190
He had no choice.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.670
Take the cure
just like your uncle did.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.399
No.

15:38.280 --> 15:39.475
40 percent..

15:39.560 --> 15:41.870
Nora's gotta
convince Grace now.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.469
Metas killed your parents,
Gracie.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.870
They all deserve to die.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.314
Don't believe him, Grace.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.675
This is just
in your mind.

15:49.800 --> 15:50.950
She's right, Gracie.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.599
It's why you created him.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.040
He's the man
who took care of you.

15:58.480 --> 15:59.914
19 percent.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.616
I know a part of you knows
that this is wrong.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.552
But the other dark
part of you is out there

16:03.640 --> 16:05.711
in the real world
killing innocent people.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.917
You can make a choice
to stop it.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.195
How?

16:09.320 --> 16:10.800
Wake up
and take the cure.

16:10.880 --> 16:11.800
Shut up.

16:11.801 --> 16:13.201
You can do this, Gracie.

16:14.560 --> 16:15.560
Get ready.

16:20.720 --> 16:21.640
Grace.

16:21.641 --> 16:22.560
- Gracie.
- Grace.

16:22.561 --> 16:24.199
- Grace. Grace
- Grace. Grace.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.999
<i>Grace!</i>

16:31.360 --> 16:34.034
Okay, I don't
want people to die.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.351
I'll take the cure.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.231
Thank you.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.358
Here she comes.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.832
Okay.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.310
<i>Did it work?
Guys, what's happening?</i>

17:19.040 --> 17:20.872
Joe, no!

17:38.800 --> 17:40.871
Now I'll finish
what I started.

17:40.960 --> 17:41.996
It didn't work.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.634
That shard in her head.

17:43.720 --> 17:45.393
It's still part
of the dagger.

17:45.480 --> 17:47.597
Its dark energy is enough
to counteract the cure.

17:47.680 --> 17:50.878
If we want to cure Grace,
we must destroy that dagger.

17:55.520 --> 17:56.520
No, no, no.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.353
No, no, no!

17:58.440 --> 18:00.159
Nora!

18:04.600 --> 18:08.958
You took my family
away from me, Flash.

18:09.040 --> 18:11.396
Now watch me take yours.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.358
- No!
<i>- Barry!</i>

19:24.640 --> 19:26.472
Just in time.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.797
Gentlemen.

19:39.880 --> 19:42.475
I hate to inform you, but...

19:44.440 --> 19:46.113
You're all dead.

20:00.680 --> 20:02.751
Thawne...

20:02.840 --> 20:05.036
I... I... I can help you.

20:05.120 --> 20:08.477
Isn't this ironic?

20:13.200 --> 20:15.556
Time to repent.

20:24.800 --> 20:28.919
Consider this
a parting gift.

21:11.720 --> 21:16.636
Just... in...

21:19.280 --> 21:21.875
Well, well.

21:21.960 --> 21:24.156
It appears as if someone
has figured out

21:24.240 --> 21:27.153
how to reverse time.

21:27.240 --> 21:29.038
Clever girl.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.679
We figured
out everything.

21:30.760 --> 21:33.832
Oh, really?

21:33.920 --> 21:35.479
What have you figured out?

21:35.560 --> 21:38.951
We figured out why
you sent Nora back,

21:39.040 --> 21:41.680
why you had her punch
DeVoe's satellite...

21:41.760 --> 21:43.911
to create a Cicada
we could stop.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.070
Right?

21:45.160 --> 21:46.160
A dagger

21:46.280 --> 21:47.953
we could destroy.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.496
It was the dagger
that was keeping you

21:49.520 --> 21:51.352
in prison all
along, wasn't it?

21:51.440 --> 21:52.476
That's right.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.040
15 years.

21:54.120 --> 21:56.635
The second time I've
been stuck somewhere

21:56.720 --> 21:59.679
against my will
for 15 years.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.160
Boring.

22:01.240 --> 22:04.312
Except for your visits,
of course.

22:04.400 --> 22:07.199
You're leaving out
the most delightful part:

22:07.280 --> 22:09.590
how you both
helped me escape.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.200
We helped you?

22:11.280 --> 22:12.634
That's right.
When you traveled

22:12.720 --> 22:14.359
to the Time Vault,
remember that?

22:14.440 --> 22:16.397
<i>Oh, we need help
trying to figure out</i>

22:16.520 --> 22:17.795
<i>how to drain dark energy</i>

22:17.880 --> 22:20.190
<i>from the
"one who got away."</i>

22:20.280 --> 22:22.033
Cicada's!

22:22.120 --> 22:25.909
Remember that?
When you blurted that out

22:26.000 --> 22:28.231
in the middle of the Time Vault,
so that years later,

22:28.320 --> 22:29.696
when I ended up
with Cicada's dagger

22:29.720 --> 22:33.760
strapped to my chest,
I knew exactly what I had to do:

22:33.840 --> 22:35.718
get Nora Allen to trust me.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.029
Easy.

22:37.120 --> 22:40.477
Just like when I got
you to trust me,

22:40.560 --> 22:43.473
and then everything starts
falling into place.

22:43.560 --> 22:45.153
Why?

22:45.240 --> 22:48.392
Because I am
the only speedster

22:48.480 --> 22:51.473
that knows how
to manipulate the timeline

22:51.560 --> 22:54.712
to get what I want,

22:54.800 --> 22:57.759
orchestrate the changes
that I need,

22:57.840 --> 23:00.309
some of which...

23:00.440 --> 23:01.874
are happening right now,

23:01.960 --> 23:03.838
to ensure one thing:

23:03.920 --> 23:08.039
That I go free.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.351
We don't need
a dagger to stop you.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.397
Well then,

23:13.360 --> 23:16.637
let's just see how much
your father taught you.

23:53.840 --> 23:57.072
I guess you're not
as good a teacher as I am.

23:57.160 --> 23:59.038
You can't save him, Nora.

23:59.120 --> 24:01.191
No matter what you do,

24:01.280 --> 24:06.230
no matter what you try,
the Flash will always vanish.

24:06.320 --> 24:09.438
That is his legacy.

24:44.520 --> 24:47.274
Isn't this nice?

24:47.360 --> 24:51.877
Team Flash,
back together again...

24:51.960 --> 24:53.713
with a new guy.

24:53.800 --> 24:54.836
Ralph Dibny.

24:55.680 --> 24:57.558
Welcome.
You should be dead.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.353
Yeah, I guess
we have that in common.

25:00.880 --> 25:02.553
We'll take care of that
in a moment.

25:02.640 --> 25:04.154
Iris.

25:04.240 --> 25:05.560
Always a pleasure.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.074
Frost.

25:10.160 --> 25:12.152
Cisco.

25:12.280 --> 25:14.351
It warms my heart
to see you again.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.716
I want to apologize for...

25:17.640 --> 25:19.359
But had I not done that,

25:20.400 --> 25:24.599
you never would've had the means
to become extraordinary.

25:24.680 --> 25:26.194
I don't need
powers for that.

25:44.520 --> 25:46.637
Now!

26:14.600 --> 26:18.719
It's not my father's legacy
that's gonna disappear, Thawne.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.200
It's yours.

26:20.280 --> 26:21.999
- Nora!
- Hey!

26:22.080 --> 26:25.915
So close,
Little Runner.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.356
It was never going
to work anyway.

26:31.200 --> 26:34.238
- Mom? Dad?
- No.

26:34.360 --> 26:37.398
- No, no, no, no.
- Mom, what's happening?

26:39.080 --> 26:40.673
A new timeline is setting in.

26:40.760 --> 26:44.117
- What?
- A new timeline that you created

26:44.200 --> 26:46.192
when you destroyed
the dagger!

26:46.280 --> 26:49.193
I'm sorry,
Little Runner,

26:49.280 --> 26:51.272
for trading you in like this.

26:51.360 --> 26:55.673
But I had to be sure
that I could go free.

26:57.360 --> 26:59.192
You can still
save her, Barry.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.198
There's still time.
You can still save her.

27:02.280 --> 27:03.999
How?

27:04.080 --> 27:06.151
The Negative Speed Force.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.640
She has to go there.

27:07.720 --> 27:11.270
It's the only place immune
to timeline changes.

27:11.360 --> 27:13.397
But you have to go now.

27:13.480 --> 27:15.199
You have to go, Barry!

27:15.320 --> 27:17.596
Or we lose her forever.

27:18.800 --> 27:22.271
That's right.
I've grown fond of her too.

27:23.280 --> 27:24.714
In many ways...

27:26.120 --> 27:28.874
she's shown me what it's like
to have a daughter.

27:31.800 --> 27:34.440
See you in our next crisis.

28:00.400 --> 28:01.880
I can't do this.

28:01.960 --> 28:03.456
Yes you can, yes you can.
You have to, all right?

28:03.480 --> 28:04.709
Just hold on
a little longer.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.598
No, Dad, I can't.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.000
Nora!

28:08.120 --> 28:10.555
I can't.

28:13.280 --> 28:14.999
- Nora, what are we doing?
- It's too late.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.256
What? No, it's not.
We gotta go back.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.999
- Dad, no.
- Barry, you have

28:18.080 --> 28:19.296
- to take her back.
- I know, I know.

28:19.320 --> 28:20.549
- Mom, Mom.
- I know, I know.

28:20.640 --> 28:22.313
Nora, you have
to go back now.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.880
No!

28:26.040 --> 28:29.317
If I go back in,
the Negative Speed Force

28:29.400 --> 28:31.039
will be a part
of me forever.

28:31.120 --> 28:32.554
No, we'll get
it out of you, Nora.

28:32.640 --> 28:33.936
We can get it out.
we can save you.

28:33.960 --> 28:36.839
- Please, I promise.
- Mom, you can't.

28:36.920 --> 28:39.355
Mom, you can't.

28:40.040 --> 28:41.554
None of you can.

28:42.520 --> 28:44.830
It's making me like Thawne.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.991
Full of anger and hate.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.635
I... I don't want that
to be my legacy.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.154
- This is all on me.
- No.

28:51.240 --> 28:52.913
All of it.

28:53.040 --> 28:54.190
My mistake.

28:54.280 --> 28:57.318
And I'm not gonna
make another one.

28:57.400 --> 29:00.996
Sometimes all you can do
is live with the consequences.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.519
Nora...

29:06.280 --> 29:07.714
Oh, my god.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.440
It's okay. It's okay.

29:11.920 --> 29:13.798
It's okay.

29:15.480 --> 29:17.995
We love you.

29:18.080 --> 29:20.834
Thank you
for everything.

29:32.160 --> 29:33.435
No...

29:53.280 --> 29:56.159
We're so sorry.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.597
We have to believe
that we'll see her again.

30:04.040 --> 30:06.111
We will.

30:10.960 --> 30:12.360
Nora...

30:12.440 --> 30:15.478
made sure that we didn't
lose everything tonight.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.438
She saved every meta
in the city.

30:17.520 --> 30:19.432
And she gave Grace
a new future.

30:19.520 --> 30:20.954
Gave all of us, right?

30:21.040 --> 30:22.156
Especially me.

30:22.240 --> 30:24.516
Without Nora,
I never would've met

30:24.600 --> 30:26.080
the love of my life, Renee.

30:26.160 --> 30:28.834
And you wouldn't
have stopped your 38th Cicada.

30:28.920 --> 30:31.116
Or your 39th.

30:32.520 --> 30:34.910
Right.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.514
It's been quite
a journey.

30:39.440 --> 30:40.999
Pleasure.

30:41.080 --> 30:43.515
An honor, Flash.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.115
We never could've solved
this mystery without you.

30:46.200 --> 30:48.476
Well, don't be too sure.

30:48.560 --> 30:51.473
You already have a master
detective in your midst.

30:51.560 --> 30:55.076
Congratulations, Adult Giraffe.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.757
Well done, Sherloque.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.519
Sherlock.

31:07.400 --> 31:08.720
Well, all right then.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.757
Without further ado...

31:16.680 --> 31:18.637
<i>Mes amis.</i>

31:18.720 --> 31:20.473
Good luck, Team Flash.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.000
It's Singh.

31:30.080 --> 31:33.357
Yeah, he, uh... he wants us
to meet him at CCPD

31:33.440 --> 31:34.874
and bring Barry.

31:37.600 --> 31:39.319
Yeah, go.

31:39.400 --> 31:41.756
I kinda want
to be alone anyway.

32:29.680 --> 32:31.319
Is everything okay?

32:34.920 --> 32:36.912
What Thawne said...

32:39.120 --> 32:40.918
I don't want that.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.714
I don't want
the extraordinary thing

32:44.800 --> 32:47.759
about my life
to be my powers.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.710
No one feels that way.

32:50.800 --> 32:53.031
Here's the thing.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.270
I do.

33:01.680 --> 33:06.072
All these years
I thought that Vibe

33:06.720 --> 33:09.394
was the person
I was supposed to be.

33:12.600 --> 33:15.593
I think it's time Cisco
finally got his turn.

33:16.840 --> 33:19.116
So what does
that mean?

33:26.480 --> 33:27.914
It means I want
to take the cure.

33:33.440 --> 33:36.274
- If you do this...
- There's no going back.

33:43.600 --> 33:44.750
I know.

33:58.080 --> 34:00.720
Killer Frost and I
are really gonna miss Vibe.

34:03.960 --> 34:04.960
Me too.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.353
How do you feel?

34:35.080 --> 34:36.911
Scared.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.076
But I'm hopeful.

34:46.280 --> 34:48.272
Before I forget,

34:48.360 --> 34:51.114
I left you something
in the workshop.

34:51.199 --> 34:56.320
Just, you know,
my way of saying thank you.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.520
For what?

34:58.600 --> 35:00.193
For being a great friend.

35:21.240 --> 35:23.197
Well, Grace Gibbons
is currently scheduled

35:23.280 --> 35:24.496
to meet with our
county counselor,

35:24.520 --> 35:26.056
and as soon as possible,
we'll get her in

35:26.080 --> 35:27.833
with a good foster family.

35:27.920 --> 35:29.957
Look, I won't
keep you long,

35:30.040 --> 35:31.554
but I just wanted
to thank you

35:31.640 --> 35:33.160
for being at the forefront
with Cicada.

35:33.240 --> 35:35.072
Just doing
our job, sir.

35:35.160 --> 35:38.756
Well, you went way beyond
just doing your job.

35:38.840 --> 35:41.196
And I know you did it
because of how much

35:41.280 --> 35:43.351
you care for
the people of this city,

35:43.440 --> 35:47.719
which is how I know I can leave
it in your capable hands.

35:47.800 --> 35:49.598
What do you mean,
leave it?

35:49.680 --> 35:52.195
The mayor's
offered me the job

35:52.280 --> 35:55.000
as the new
chief of police.

35:55.080 --> 35:56.116
What?

35:56.200 --> 35:57.554
- David.
- David.

35:57.640 --> 35:59.438
- Congratulations.
- That's great.

35:59.520 --> 36:01.751
Thank you, thanks.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.752
Of course that leaves me
responsible for finding

36:03.840 --> 36:05.433
my own replacement.

36:05.520 --> 36:08.115
And, uh...

36:08.200 --> 36:10.920
I would like that
to be you, Joe.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.311
Re... replace you?

36:14.440 --> 36:16.033
As... as captain?

36:16.120 --> 36:17.918
Captain Joe West.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.639
Oh, I like
the sound of that.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.393
And don't worry.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.995
If things get dicey,
as they tend to around here,

36:24.080 --> 36:26.720
you'll have
plenty of help.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.200
Isn't that right, Flash?

36:29.760 --> 36:31.717
But... wait, I'm not...

36:31.800 --> 36:33.200
Oh, come on, Barry.

36:33.280 --> 36:34.555
I'm a detective too.

36:36.480 --> 36:38.278
Sir.

36:42.560 --> 36:43.755
Congratulations.

36:43.840 --> 36:44.840
I'll do my best.

36:56.960 --> 36:58.235
Hey.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.519
Now I know what my dad
meant when he said

37:12.600 --> 37:14.200
being a parent is like
wearing your heart

37:14.240 --> 37:16.516
on the outside
of your body.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.319
Yeah.

37:19.480 --> 37:21.437
Thawne got away.

37:21.520 --> 37:24.080
Again.

37:24.160 --> 37:28.040
Nora's gone.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.152
It should feel
like a loss but,

37:33.600 --> 37:35.319
I also feel...

37:35.400 --> 37:37.995
- Pride?
- Pride, yeah.

37:42.280 --> 37:43.430
She did good.

37:45.960 --> 37:47.633
Yeah.

37:48.960 --> 37:51.919
She was the best
of both of us.

37:52.920 --> 37:56.755
She was my legacy
all along.

37:56.840 --> 38:00.754
And us, together,
as a family,

38:00.880 --> 38:02.917
that's how I want
to be remembered.

38:03.800 --> 38:05.439
As a good man,

38:06.760 --> 38:08.877
a loving husband...

38:11.120 --> 38:12.679
a supportive father.

38:14.520 --> 38:17.035
You're already
all of those things.

38:18.440 --> 38:19.760
Nora felt that way too.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.278
- Time language.
- Mm-hmm.

38:37.120 --> 38:39.919
No matter what changes
with the timeline,

38:40.880 --> 38:42.280
that'll never change.

38:43.360 --> 38:44.714
Yeah.

38:45.560 --> 38:47.233
We'll always have this
to remember her.

39:09.360 --> 39:11.670
<i>Hi, Mom and Dad.</i>

39:11.760 --> 39:13.353
<i>If you're watching this,</i>

39:13.440 --> 39:16.274
<i>it means that
something went wrong.</i>

39:16.360 --> 39:18.750
<i>But I don't want you
guys to be sad.</i>

39:18.840 --> 39:20.433
<i>I'm not.</i>

39:20.520 --> 39:24.230
<i>I always wanted
to be a hero,</i>

39:24.320 --> 39:27.916
<i>to use my extraordinary
abilities to help people.</i>

39:28.000 --> 39:29.639
<i>That's why I came here:</i>

39:29.760 --> 39:32.958
<i>To meet my family,
stop Cicada,</i>

39:33.040 --> 39:35.396
<i>help fix the Flash's legacy,</i>

39:35.480 --> 39:38.712
<i>and save him from
disappearing in the future.</i>

39:39.640 --> 39:42.633
<i>I believed I could
do the impossible,</i>

39:43.160 --> 39:47.598
<i>but I never imagined
it would turn out like this.</i>

39:47.680 --> 39:50.115
<i>I'm glad it did.</i>

39:50.240 --> 39:52.471
<i>I wouldn't
change anything</i>

39:52.560 --> 39:54.995
<i>about my time with you,</i>

39:55.120 --> 39:57.840
<i>my sweet parents,</i>

39:57.920 --> 40:01.516
<i>the most important people
to me in the world.</i>

40:03.960 --> 40:09.080
<i>I wish I could be there
to celebrate every new chapter,</i>

40:09.160 --> 40:12.551
<i>to witness every success.</i>

40:16.600 --> 40:18.398
<i>Just know...</i>

40:18.480 --> 40:20.949
<i>that no matter where
I go in my life,</i>

40:21.640 --> 40:25.554
<i>you'll always
be my side.</i>

40:30.640 --> 40:32.279
<i>Because of you,</i>

40:32.360 --> 40:37.640
<i>I know I will never,
ever, truly be alone,</i>

40:38.320 --> 40:43.520
<i>and I will feel your love
and support like a warm hug</i>

40:43.600 --> 40:45.557
<i>comforting me,</i>

40:46.400 --> 40:49.552
<i>wishing me to be the best
person I can be.</i>

40:51.760 --> 40:55.117
<i>Thank you
for everything...</i>

40:57.040 --> 41:00.556
<i>For making me a hero</i>

41:00.640 --> 41:04.680
<i>and for loving me
even if I wasn't perfect.</i>

41:04.760 --> 41:07.320
<i>Please remember
that I love you both</i>

41:08.040 --> 41:10.555
<i>and I always will,</i>

41:10.640 --> 41:13.712
<i>no matter what
the future brings.</i>

41:44.920 --> 41:46.513
<i>Incoming time flux.</i>

42:22.920 --> 42:24.320
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
