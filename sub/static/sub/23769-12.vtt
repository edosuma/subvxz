00:17.560 --> 00:19.040
-There's no reception.
-[panting]

00:20.120 --> 00:21.520
[Ryan] Marcus! Wake up!

00:22.120 --> 00:23.880
Help!

00:23.960 --> 00:25.760
-Did you reach her?
-Nothing.

00:27.080 --> 00:29.520
-Have you guys heard from Hayley?
-No.

00:29.640 --> 00:30.680
-We should go look for her.
-[Daniel] Right.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.640
[police officer] Nobody move.
We're securing the premises.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.320
[Alex] What's going on?

[theme music playing]

01:03.440 --> 01:05.319
[indistinct chatter]

01:12.440 --> 01:13.800
Excuse me, Officer?

01:15.320 --> 01:18.560
My mom and sister are by the cave.
Could I just please go? It's just...

01:30.160 --> 01:32.160
Go over to Jackie.
I'll distract the cops.

01:32.240 --> 01:33.440
Hey, let us out of here!

01:33.520 --> 01:36.680
-[all yelling]
-[Brooke] Hey, stop! Leave him alone!

01:45.320 --> 01:46.240
It's open.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.560
-Marcus!
-Marcus! Wake up!

02:00.480 --> 02:01.640
Hayley!

02:02.760 --> 02:03.600
Hayley!

02:03.680 --> 02:05.720
-[alarm blaring]
-[Hayley] Marcus! Marcus!

02:05.800 --> 02:08.400
Marcus! You have to let
Leo and Daniel in!

02:09.360 --> 02:12.320
Come on, press the button!
So close! Press it!

02:12.400 --> 02:14.720
-[Ryan] Yes.
-Yes, yes, yes!

02:19.160 --> 02:20.520
-[Hayley] Come on!
-Hayley!

02:20.600 --> 02:22.960
-There's a bomb! There! In there!
-Where?

02:23.040 --> 02:24.400
[panting]

02:25.720 --> 02:28.400
-Come on, you gotta open it!
-How do we get the door open?

02:28.480 --> 02:31.440
[Ryan] There's a special key that unlocks
the door. They took it with them.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.320
Just go! Go! Leave! Go!

02:33.400 --> 02:35.920
We're not leaving you here.
There's gotta be a spare key.

02:36.000 --> 02:36.960
[grunts] Marcus!

02:37.840 --> 02:38.880
Marcus!

02:38.960 --> 02:40.640
-Could it be this?
-How did you--

02:40.720 --> 02:42.360
I found it in your safe. Go, go!

02:42.440 --> 02:43.920
[Leo] Come on, hurry!

02:44.000 --> 02:45.800
-[grunts] Come on!
-[Hayley] Come on! Yes!

02:45.880 --> 02:48.560
-[Leo] Let's get it out of here!
-All right, careful, careful.

02:48.640 --> 02:49.560
[Leo grunts]

02:50.920 --> 02:53.280
[timer beeping rapidly]

03:24.280 --> 03:26.000
Thought you could use a souvenir.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.560
[chuckles]

03:30.040 --> 03:31.200
[Alex] Mom!

03:34.840 --> 03:36.600
[Ryan sobbing]

03:41.200 --> 03:42.920
[Alex] I can't believe this is happening.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.080
[Ryan] Me neither, sweetie.

03:45.160 --> 03:49.760
[sighs] I think it's time
we had a proper introduction.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.960
Hi. I'm Ryan Woods.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.080
Leo.

03:53.920 --> 03:54.920
Daniel.

03:55.640 --> 03:56.720
My daughter has good taste.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.560
[all chuckle]

03:58.640 --> 04:00.920
I think there's someone else
to see you too.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.480
[inaudible]

04:41.040 --> 04:44.120
[reporter]  NASA astronaut
and scientist Dr. Ryan Woods

04:44.200 --> 04:47.080
was found alive today
on the Greenhouse campus.

04:47.160 --> 04:49.280
Felony charges
on national security breaches

04:49.360 --> 04:51.800
and the kidnapping of Dr. Woods
are pending

04:51.880 --> 04:54.800
as authorities have already made
a few arrests.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.800
[indistinct chatter over radio]

05:04.240 --> 05:05.720
[door closes]

05:19.960 --> 05:21.760
[engine starts]

05:26.160 --> 05:27.840
[siren chirps]

05:31.440 --> 05:32.600
So they found you.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.560
[sighs] I found them.

05:37.480 --> 05:41.680
I figured it was better to see you
every few weeks in jail than...

05:42.920 --> 05:44.480
than to be free without you.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.920
[sobbing] I'm so sorry, Daniel.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.720
I'm so sorry.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.520
I love you.

05:59.240 --> 06:00.320
[officer] We should go.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.880
-[engine starts]
-[Daniel] Goodbye, Mom.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.280
[officer] Ma'am.

06:10.080 --> 06:11.640
[Judy sobbing]

06:22.280 --> 06:24.160
[indistinct chatter over radio]

06:26.960 --> 06:27.880
[sobs]

06:29.600 --> 06:31.040
Goodbye, Mom.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.320
[Hayley] Hey!

06:37.000 --> 06:40.680
Uh, so meet...
This is Jackie, my best friend.

06:40.760 --> 06:41.600
Hi.

06:41.680 --> 06:44.880
You and Max were the ones
that brought back the satellite, right?

06:44.960 --> 06:47.240
-I see you're all caught up.
-[chuckles]

06:47.320 --> 06:49.200
I've still got a lot of catching up to do.

06:49.280 --> 06:51.040
-[chuckles]
-Yeah.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.520
-Ryan! Is that really you?
-Louis!

06:54.160 --> 06:57.840
I'm gonna go find Max.
It was really nice to meet you guys.

06:58.440 --> 07:01.760
This is both the saddest
and the happiest day of my life.

07:02.440 --> 07:04.160
-[sighs] Well...
-[chuckles]

07:04.240 --> 07:08.120
-Uh, Mom, Dad, this is Brooke.
-Hi, I'm his girlfriend.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.440
[chuckles]

07:10.400 --> 07:11.760
Wait. Really?

07:12.960 --> 07:15.440
-[chuckles] Awesome.
-[all laugh]

07:24.000 --> 07:26.400
Ryan Woods is back
and you're stuck in here?

07:26.480 --> 07:28.280
What could possibly be more important?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.200
Look who's back.

07:33.480 --> 07:34.560
Emma!

07:34.640 --> 07:37.680
Hey! So good to see you.

07:38.800 --> 07:39.960
Thanks, Jackie.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.760
For everything. Max has just told me
what you two did.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.800
I basically just kept him company.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.360
-[chuckles]
-That's not true.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.800
I should leave you guys alone
so you can catch up.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.320
Happy to have you back.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.880
It's good to be here.

07:56.520 --> 07:57.520
[chuckles]

08:07.480 --> 08:09.840
So, how long are you and Alex gone for?

08:09.920 --> 08:11.480
Louis gave us the week off.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.680
This is so unreal.

08:17.600 --> 08:18.600
It's real, Hayley.

08:23.960 --> 08:27.400
So, if you get bored or whatever,
you know, you can call me anytime.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.240
Sure.

08:35.679 --> 08:37.159
[Louie chimes]

08:42.039 --> 08:43.159
[Brooke] Who was that?

08:44.680 --> 08:46.760
Oh, that was Fox News. [chuckles]

08:47.320 --> 08:48.640
-Really?
-And before that,

08:48.720 --> 08:53.560
-CNN, MSNBC and Channel 5 KTLA News.
-Oh, my...

08:53.640 --> 08:56.120
I think they want to do
an exclusive interview with me.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.160
So why are you screening them?

08:59.720 --> 09:02.520
I am not gonna fall for that trap anymore.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.280
-Need any help?
-I think I got it.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.680
[both giggling]

09:18.560 --> 09:20.120
-Thanks.
-[chuckles]

09:21.000 --> 09:23.560
[sighs] I should go now.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.000
My mom can't wait to go home.

09:26.080 --> 09:28.120
-Yeah. Yeah, I don't blame her.
-Mmm.

09:33.040 --> 09:36.760
Well, I'm... I hate saying goodbyes.

09:37.440 --> 09:42.040
Well, it's not really goodbye.
It's only a week.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.200
I know... It's just that

09:44.880 --> 09:47.360
we didn't really have enough time
to be together.

09:49.080 --> 09:53.360
Well, we'll have all the time in the world
when you get back.

10:13.240 --> 10:14.520
[both chuckle]

10:15.880 --> 10:17.320
You know, before I came to the Greenhouse,

10:17.400 --> 10:19.800
the scariest thing
that ever happened to me

10:19.880 --> 10:23.480
was when my hard drive was destroyed
because I spilled pineapple juice on it.

10:23.560 --> 10:24.920
[both chuckle]

10:25.560 --> 10:27.840
Well, it made you stronger.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.520
No one would ever believe me
if I told them

10:34.600 --> 10:37.080
what happened to us in the last 24 hours.

10:38.360 --> 10:39.680
I would.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.320
Really?

10:59.760 --> 11:02.120
-Take care of this place?
-I'll do my best.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.000
What's the worst that could happen?

11:05.080 --> 11:06.280
[laughs]

11:08.400 --> 11:10.440
-I'll see you soon.
-Okay. Bye.

11:13.840 --> 11:14.680
[Leo] Hayley!

11:16.360 --> 11:18.240
Hey, uh, do you need help?

11:19.120 --> 11:21.160
I think I can manage to the car.

11:23.160 --> 11:27.000
I'm really happy for you.
Having your mom back and everything.

11:29.160 --> 11:31.120
A lot of it is because of you, Leo.

11:32.880 --> 11:34.120
Um...

11:34.760 --> 11:36.440
you know, I'd be even happier if...

11:38.200 --> 11:39.880
if we were together.

11:42.960 --> 11:45.960
[stutters] I don't want
to pressure you or anything and...

11:46.040 --> 11:48.520
It always seems like
the wrong time, but...

11:52.440 --> 11:53.880
I love you.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.440
I've loved you since I first saw you.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.400
[sighs] I should probably go.

12:32.600 --> 12:35.600
Hey, guys.
Sorry, I had to say my goodbyes.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.000
You ready to go home, guys?

12:42.080 --> 12:43.320
Yeah.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.440
-Let's go.
-[Daniel] Hayley.

12:48.320 --> 12:52.800
Uh, could you guys
take my bags to the car?

12:52.880 --> 12:56.760
Uh, run the air conditioner.
I'll be there in a second.

13:03.360 --> 13:04.560
Hey.

13:05.120 --> 13:06.280
Hey.

13:06.360 --> 13:07.840
How are you?

13:08.440 --> 13:12.040
Um, I'm good. More or less.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.680
My mom turned herself in.

13:17.720 --> 13:19.040
She's going to prison.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.320
She'll be fine.

13:23.320 --> 13:24.560
She's a strong woman.

13:25.160 --> 13:28.240
Well, I didn't mean to bring you down.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.840
Go. Your family's waiting for you.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.760
Don't you want it?

13:37.920 --> 13:39.240
Keep it.

13:39.880 --> 13:43.600
It will remind you of our
"Eureka" times together.

13:43.680 --> 13:46.200
[chuckles softly] "Eureka time."

13:46.880 --> 13:48.360
I like it.

13:49.320 --> 13:52.120
Daniel, I will never forget
what you did today.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.520
And everything you've done
since it all started.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.080
And you have to admit,

13:59.160 --> 14:01.640
I never let my feelings for you
disrupt our mission.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.560
[car horn honks]

14:07.520 --> 14:10.440
[sighs heavily] I should go.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.600
What took you so long?

14:35.680 --> 14:36.840
You all right?

14:36.920 --> 14:38.680
You look like a piano
just landed on your hand.

14:38.760 --> 14:41.320
-[scoffs] Try two pianos.
-What?

14:42.720 --> 14:44.600
Come on. Let's go home.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.200
[cell phone chimes]

15:06.360 --> 15:07.600
[cell phone ringing]

15:10.800 --> 15:12.440
[distorted voice]  Did you make it
to the place I sent you?

15:12.520 --> 15:15.480
I did. The money's not here.

15:15.560 --> 15:20.320
Yes. I figure why pay the money
when you'll have nowhere to spend it?

15:20.400 --> 15:21.240
Excuse me?

15:22.160 --> 15:23.640
[siren blaring]

15:25.720 --> 15:27.560
Freeze! Put your hands up
where I can see them!

16:46.160 --> 16:47.640
[Max] There you are.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.360
[panting]

16:49.440 --> 16:51.200
I've been looking everywhere for you.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.040
-Did you want some alone time?
-Yeah.

16:59.120 --> 17:01.800
But the water started getting choppy,
so I came in.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.160
And then you showed up.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.240
-Where's Emma?
-Why?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.119
You guys seemed pretty busy earlier.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.640
Jackie, there's something
I want to tell you.

17:13.720 --> 17:16.359
Forget it, Max. It's okay.

17:16.440 --> 17:17.960
How do you know what I wanna say?

17:18.040 --> 17:21.319
You don't have to apologize.
I'm happy for you.

17:21.960 --> 17:22.880
Apologize for what?

17:24.960 --> 17:26.400
You two getting together.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.160
Emma and me?

17:31.040 --> 17:32.040
We're not together.

17:34.200 --> 17:35.280
You're not?

17:35.360 --> 17:38.720
She wanted us to be a couple,
but I told her I wasn't interested.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.200
Max, you're such a wuss.
I mean, grow up, already.

17:45.280 --> 17:48.440
She already told you she wanted you.
What more do you need?

17:51.560 --> 17:53.000
You.

17:55.160 --> 17:56.160
What?

17:56.240 --> 17:58.400
I told her I wanna be with you.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.240
Really?

18:05.560 --> 18:07.400
I told her she was great, but...

18:08.920 --> 18:10.200
I'm in love with you.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.520
Didn't you know?

18:14.760 --> 18:15.960
No.

18:18.040 --> 18:19.400
And now that you do?

18:37.480 --> 18:38.520
You're a little rusty.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.320
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. Oh, man.

18:40.400 --> 18:41.720
I came back from the dead

18:41.800 --> 18:43.560
-and I am still better than you.
-Oh!

18:44.120 --> 18:45.480
-Yes!
