WEBVTT

00:04.141 --> 00:06.074
Wait, wait.

00:06.184 --> 00:07.984
I can't.

00:08.086 --> 00:10.720
- I love my wife.
- And stop.

00:11.956 --> 00:13.390
Listen, class.

00:13.492 --> 00:16.426
To win awards, you must do
gay sex scenes.

00:16.528 --> 00:18.293
But how do we know you're gay

00:18.396 --> 00:20.930
if there's no shame on your face?

00:21.032 --> 00:23.465
Oh, hey, I went in
for that new Ryan Murphy thing.

00:23.568 --> 00:24.634
I got halfway through my audition,

00:24.736 --> 00:25.768
and then they cut me off.

00:25.870 --> 00:27.069
Why?

00:27.171 --> 00:28.303
They're not even considering anyone

00:28.406 --> 00:30.439
with under 50,000 Instagram followers.

00:30.542 --> 00:31.541
Eww.

00:31.643 --> 00:32.607
Are you going in for it?

00:32.710 --> 00:34.109
Yeah, on Monday.

00:34.211 --> 00:36.012
I had to call
the casting director myself

00:36.113 --> 00:38.313
because my dumb-ass agent is useless.

00:38.416 --> 00:40.182
And let's go again.

00:40.284 --> 00:41.751
Oh, that's it.

00:41.853 --> 00:43.318
- Yeah!
- Hey...

00:43.421 --> 00:44.754
- Oh...
- I was thinking...

00:44.856 --> 00:46.621
We should give Chase fish oil

00:46.723 --> 00:48.257
to help build muscle.

00:48.359 --> 00:50.125
Oh, um, yeah.

00:50.227 --> 00:52.494
- O... okay.
- But it can thin the blood,

00:52.596 --> 00:54.363
so we have to watch out for nosebleeds.

00:54.465 --> 00:56.432
Um, can we just pause the Chase talk

00:56.534 --> 00:58.400
until after we're finished?

00:58.502 --> 00:59.768
Right, right, right.

01:01.004 --> 01:02.971
Hey, do you think that Chase
could tag me in something

01:03.074 --> 01:04.673
to boost my followers?

01:04.775 --> 01:06.208
Um...

01:06.310 --> 01:07.943
Hey, do you think Chase is liking

01:08.045 --> 01:09.644
his core-strengthening exercises?

01:09.746 --> 01:12.114
- Um...
- And, orgasm.

01:12.216 --> 01:13.696
Oh, my God!

01:13.790 --> 01:15.584
Oh, my God.

01:15.609 --> 01:16.662
Oh, shit.

01:16.687 --> 01:18.619
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

01:18.721 --> 01:20.488
Well, what about "Watch What Happens"?

01:20.590 --> 01:21.922
Didn't you get any followers from that?

01:22.024 --> 01:23.491
Yeah, but I still need 10,000 more

01:23.593 --> 01:24.892
in the next three days

01:24.994 --> 01:27.249
- to even be considered for the role.
- Oh, my God.

01:27.335 --> 01:28.796
I can't believe that's how it works now.

01:28.898 --> 01:30.164
What's the part?

01:30.266 --> 01:32.266
It's a gas station attendant
who gets his ass eaten.

01:32.368 --> 01:33.468
It's a three-episode arc.

01:33.570 --> 01:35.269
Is this that Ryan Murphy miniseries

01:35.371 --> 01:36.704
about the woman who sues McDonalds?

01:36.806 --> 01:38.672
Yeah, "American Crime Story:
Hot Coffee."

01:38.774 --> 01:40.408
It would be huge for me.

01:40.510 --> 01:41.942
Can you just take one more picture of me

01:42.044 --> 01:43.511
and post it on Chase's
Instagram, please?

01:43.613 --> 01:44.778
Oh, my God, fine.

01:44.880 --> 01:46.413
But this is the last one, okay?

01:46.515 --> 01:47.981
All of his posts today have been you.

01:48.083 --> 01:49.316
Eww, don't smile.

01:50.452 --> 01:52.419
Oh, God, we gotta go.

01:52.521 --> 01:53.953
Why are we running?

01:54.055 --> 01:55.955
I've gotta change
Chase's phone number again,

01:56.057 --> 01:57.491
get a bunch of his crotches dropped,

01:57.593 --> 01:59.493
and mail his passport
application by 2:00.

01:59.595 --> 02:01.027
- Where is he going?
- He's going to Ottawa

02:01.130 --> 02:02.929
for some fan meet-up, wherever that is.

02:03.031 --> 02:05.098
- It's the capitol of Canada.
- My God.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.733
Who cares, bitch?

02:06.835 --> 02:08.535
I'm sorry, I'm just...

02:08.637 --> 02:10.002
I'm so overworked.

02:10.104 --> 02:12.105
Mom is MIA doing God knows what.

02:12.207 --> 02:14.073
All I ever do is think about Chase.

02:14.176 --> 02:15.175
Like, what about me?

02:15.277 --> 02:16.643
I need some goddamn romance.

02:16.745 --> 02:18.511
I was sleeping with
his trainer the other day,

02:18.613 --> 02:20.713
and he would not shut up about him.

02:22.617 --> 02:25.118
Well, why don't you start
by dating someone

02:25.219 --> 02:27.386
- not on Chase's team?
- I know.

02:27.488 --> 02:29.588
I need to date somebody
not in the industry.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.158
Just some normal, boring guy like...

02:32.260 --> 02:35.028
you know, like this guy, but hot.

02:35.130 --> 02:36.595
I am so sorry.

02:37.799 --> 02:39.331
Hey, um, sorry to bug you,

02:39.433 --> 02:41.534
but are you in that ChaseDreams video?

02:41.636 --> 02:42.902
Yes.

02:43.004 --> 02:44.236
I saw you on "Watch What Happens"!

02:44.338 --> 02:46.372
I love bartending for Andy.

02:46.474 --> 02:48.240
Oh. Yeah, hi, I'm Cary.

02:48.342 --> 02:50.108
- I'm an actor.
- Hey, I'm Cameron.

02:50.210 --> 02:52.978
Look, this is kind of crazy,
but I'm having a party later,

02:53.080 --> 02:55.147
and my friends would freak if you came.

02:55.248 --> 02:56.614
DM me for deets.

02:56.717 --> 02:59.551
- I'm @TheCameronColby on Insta.
- Great.

02:59.653 --> 03:01.019
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:02.656 --> 03:04.589
- Okay, well, you're going.
- What?

03:04.692 --> 03:06.457
Why would I go to a stranger's party?

03:06.560 --> 03:08.760
Because he's one of those Insta gays,

03:08.862 --> 03:10.195
you know, that, like, runs around

03:10.297 --> 03:12.197
with no shirt on, posting song lyrics

03:12.299 --> 03:14.232
that have nothing to do
with the pic he's put up.

03:14.334 --> 03:16.434
Again, why would I go
to a stranger's party?

03:16.536 --> 03:18.136
So he can tag you.

03:18.238 --> 03:19.637
He's got 1 million followers.

03:19.740 --> 03:22.240
- I'm going to a stranger's party.
- Mm-hmm.

03:22.342 --> 03:24.442

- Chest exposed.

03:39.792 --> 03:41.744
- I like it.
- Yeah, it's...

03:41.838 --> 03:44.057
- Dude, that's so random.
- Hey!

03:44.111 --> 03:45.322
Oh, my God.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.564
Oh, my gosh! You came!

03:47.666 --> 03:48.632
You guys, look.

03:48.735 --> 03:50.208
This is ChaseDreams's brother.

03:50.271 --> 03:51.462
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, my gosh.

03:51.521 --> 03:52.395
Hi.

03:52.443 --> 03:53.763
Cary, this is Colby Dallas,

03:53.873 --> 03:56.273
Dallas Drake, and Drake Cameron.

03:56.375 --> 03:58.608
Hi. Uh, did I ruin the photo?

03:58.710 --> 03:59.843
Should we... should we
take another one, or...

03:59.945 --> 04:01.177
No, it's okay.

04:01.279 --> 04:02.812
We got a good one right before you came.

04:02.914 --> 04:04.513
Great, great.

04:04.616 --> 04:07.617
Well I will just, um,
hang out with you guys.

04:07.719 --> 04:08.985
- Sweet!
- Perf.

04:09.087 --> 04:10.186
- Yeah.
- Cool!

04:14.760 --> 04:16.226
So tell me about your job.

04:16.327 --> 04:17.459
Uh, you know,

04:17.562 --> 04:19.428
I've been so work-obsessed lately.

04:19.529 --> 04:21.464
Why don't we talk about your job, Tad?

04:21.565 --> 04:22.932
I work for a window manufacturer.

04:23.034 --> 04:25.601
- Oh, so you make windows.
- No, I wish.

04:25.703 --> 04:27.436
Companies send us measurements,

04:27.538 --> 04:29.572
and we work with the factories
that make the windows,

04:29.674 --> 04:32.808
and we handle delivering
the windows to the sites.

04:35.412 --> 04:37.412
Oh, um, okay. Let's see.

04:37.514 --> 04:41.116
What's a good follow-up
question to that?

04:44.255 --> 04:45.387
Uh, yeah, yeah.

04:45.489 --> 04:47.022
I guess I like breakfast.

04:47.124 --> 04:48.456
- Yeah... thank you!
- Me too.

04:48.558 --> 04:49.892
- That's what we're saying.
- I don't.

04:49.994 --> 04:52.127
- Oh, my God.
- So what do you guys do?

04:52.229 --> 04:54.997
We're influencers. You know, creators.

04:56.433 --> 04:58.267
Yeah, but... but, like, what do you do?

04:58.368 --> 05:00.468
- Uh, like, I'm an actor.
- Oh.

05:00.570 --> 05:02.136
I do inspiration.

05:02.238 --> 05:03.938
Colby's more, like, lifestyle...

05:04.040 --> 05:05.572
- Yeah.
- I'm religious, kinda.

05:05.675 --> 05:07.809
And I used to be fat,
but now I have two nieces.

05:08.912 --> 05:10.544
Cool, cool.

05:10.646 --> 05:11.913
Well, should we take a photo

05:12.015 --> 05:13.881
to commemorate this moment, or...

05:15.451 --> 05:17.401
You're so funny.

05:17.472 --> 05:20.021
A photo would actually be hilarious,

05:20.123 --> 05:21.856
but we just posted a few hours ago.

05:21.958 --> 05:23.745
And we won't post again
until 1:00 a.m. East Coast time

05:23.839 --> 05:25.226
so we can get the West Coast likes

05:25.328 --> 05:27.161
when people are
scrolling themselves to sleep.

05:27.263 --> 05:29.630
But... well, that's in, like, four hours.

05:29.732 --> 05:31.866
Won't... won't we all
be in our beds by then, or...

05:33.936 --> 05:36.036
He's killing me!

05:36.138 --> 05:38.198
But glass actually starts out...

05:38.276 --> 05:39.773
as sand.

05:39.875 --> 05:41.542
Well, that certainly has nothing to do

05:41.644 --> 05:44.244
with my work, which is what I wanted.

05:44.347 --> 05:46.513
Oh, here's another thing that's boring:

05:46.615 --> 05:49.416
Ottawa is the capitol of Canada.

05:49.518 --> 05:50.884
I actually have a list

05:50.986 --> 05:52.421
of Canadian cities that I want to visit.

05:52.499 --> 05:54.319
You know what, Tad?
Let's just go back to your place.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.523
Oh, did you not want to...
stay and keep talking?

05:56.625 --> 05:58.058
Absolutely not.

05:58.132 --> 05:59.136
Yeah, I mean, it's crazy.

05:59.161 --> 06:00.461
I hated social media,

06:00.563 --> 06:03.230
but then I started doing it,
and now I don't.

06:03.332 --> 06:05.732
You know?

06:05.834 --> 06:07.633
Yes, yeah, yeah.

06:07.736 --> 06:09.135
Mm-hmm. Sorry.

06:09.238 --> 06:10.237
I'll be right back.

06:10.339 --> 06:12.005
Okay.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:29.892 --> 06:32.259
Hold on one second.

06:33.929 --> 06:35.628
Perfect.

06:38.933 --> 06:40.462
Um... God.

06:40.548 --> 06:43.437
Uh, this song is everywhere.

06:43.462 --> 06:45.316
Um, do you mind if we just listen

06:45.341 --> 06:46.374
to something else?

06:46.399 --> 06:48.040
ChaseDreams, he's...

06:48.142 --> 06:49.442
he's, weirdly, my brother.

06:49.544 --> 06:50.910
I know.

06:51.012 --> 06:52.945
That's why I swiped right.

06:53.882 --> 06:55.347
- Eww, what?
- Look.

06:55.450 --> 06:56.982
I know you said you don't
want to talk about work,

06:57.084 --> 06:59.919
but since you brought it up,
what is Chase like?

07:00.021 --> 07:01.253
I'm a huge fan.

07:01.355 --> 07:02.488
<i>♪ Take a shower ♪</i>

07:02.590 --> 07:03.756
What is the problem?

07:03.858 --> 07:05.625
You love him, I love him.

07:05.727 --> 07:06.992
- He's an artist.
- Eww.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.562
- He's a singer.
- Look, here, here.

07:09.664 --> 07:11.596
I want to a play a song
inspired by Chase.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.832
- No, I mean...
- ♪ Chasing rainbows ♪

07:13.934 --> 07:15.133
♪ Chasing dreams ♪

07:19.440 --> 07:21.473
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

07:21.575 --> 07:22.941
Here we go. All right.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.175
- All right, yeah.
- Kind of just...

07:30.651 --> 07:32.551
Okay, yeah.
Um, and Dallas, just lean out

07:32.653 --> 07:34.519
'cause you're kind of blocking me.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.787
Yeah, that's better.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.723
- Nailed it.
- We got it!

07:38.826 --> 07:41.359
- Great, good.
- Cary, hi.

07:41.462 --> 07:42.961
We're just gonna put on glasses

07:43.063 --> 07:44.862
and get in the pool
like a bunch of idiots.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.764
Gosh, I actually have to go.

07:46.866 --> 07:49.334
I have, uh, work early,
and it's getting really late.

07:49.436 --> 07:50.701
Oh, are you shooting something?

07:50.803 --> 07:52.703
Yes, it's a very big movie.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.039
Um, but it was very nice
to meet you guys.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.407
Bye.

07:56.509 --> 07:58.176
He's so funny.

08:00.546 --> 08:02.778
All right, let's see that pic.

08:03.549 --> 08:05.184
No!

08:05.450 --> 08:07.473
Well, you know, it's romantic
to be serenaded.

08:07.552 --> 08:10.312
It was not romantic,
and it was not a break

08:10.383 --> 08:12.140
- from thinking about Chase.
- Right.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.842
But I have this date tonight

08:13.944 --> 08:15.243
with this guy from "Rolling Stone,"

08:15.346 --> 08:17.011
so he's not, like, on Chase's team,

08:17.113 --> 08:19.514
but he's in the industry enough
not to be a superfan.

08:19.616 --> 08:22.551
- Also, he's British, so...
- Accent.

08:22.653 --> 08:25.019
- Uncut.
- Ugh, look at this.

08:25.121 --> 08:27.355
Oh, is this the picture they posted?

08:27.457 --> 08:29.957
- Wait, where are you?
- Standing out of frame.

08:30.059 --> 08:31.943
Oh. I'm sorry, Care.

08:32.020 --> 08:33.394
I know. Now I gotta find another way

08:33.496 --> 08:36.138
to get 10,000 followers in two days.

08:36.207 --> 08:38.339
Oh, why don't you adopt
one of those ugly dogs?

08:38.433 --> 08:39.865
You know, the ones
that look dead but aren't.

08:39.926 --> 08:40.948
I tried.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.666
The shelter said those
are now the first to go.

08:42.729 --> 08:43.748
- Oh.
- I know.

08:43.773 --> 08:44.782
All right, I gotta go to work.

08:44.807 --> 08:45.973
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:51.046 --> 08:52.212
Oh, hey, my friend Reese

08:52.314 --> 08:53.547
went in for that Ryan Murphy thing,

08:53.649 --> 08:55.416
and they asked him about followers too.

08:55.518 --> 08:57.385
You'd love Reese.

08:57.487 --> 08:59.587
Or, no, you'd hate him.

08:59.689 --> 09:02.655
Reese is the one that got
in the fist-fight with my mom.

09:02.758 --> 09:05.304
Oh, shit.

09:05.398 --> 09:06.459
Holy smokes!

09:06.561 --> 09:08.795
It's Cameron, Colby, and the Instagays!

09:08.898 --> 09:10.430
What? How do you know them?

09:10.532 --> 09:12.299
Cary, hi!

09:12.401 --> 09:13.733
Hi, guys. What's up?

09:13.835 --> 09:15.102
Oh, we were just taking a photo

09:15.204 --> 09:16.303
in front of a school that burned down.

09:16.405 --> 09:18.071
I think we're gonna caption it,

09:18.173 --> 09:20.440
- "You make me want to la-la."
- Yeah.

09:20.542 --> 09:21.942
Um, how's the movie shoot going?

09:22.044 --> 09:23.343
Good, good.

09:23.445 --> 09:24.744
You know, getting all the shots.

09:24.846 --> 09:26.579
Are you playing a waiter?

09:26.681 --> 09:28.148
Yes. Yes, I am.

09:28.250 --> 09:31.285
Uh, I am playing the waiter, actually.

09:31.387 --> 09:32.819
The movie's called "The Waiter."

09:34.356 --> 09:37.156
- We were just talking about you.
- Oh.

09:37.258 --> 09:38.958
Do you want to come to church tonight?

09:39.060 --> 09:40.893
- As in...
- Church.

09:40.995 --> 09:42.228
8:00. Wanna come?

09:42.330 --> 09:43.695
Uh, s... sure.

09:43.798 --> 09:45.898
- I will go to church.
- Yay!

09:46.000 --> 09:48.267
Yeah, maybe after, we can try again

09:48.369 --> 09:50.169
for those West Coast sleep-scrollers.

09:51.872 --> 09:53.906
Cary, you're literally Amy Schumer.

09:54.008 --> 09:55.241
See you tonight.

09:55.343 --> 09:56.775
Bye.

09:56.877 --> 09:59.611
Sorry, um, what do you guys
wear to church?

10:00.949 --> 10:02.915
Yeah, I've been there four years.

10:03.017 --> 10:04.683
Oh, my God, that is so cool.

10:04.785 --> 10:06.819
I read "Rolling Stone"
all through high school.

10:06.921 --> 10:08.487
- Did you?
- Well, no,

10:08.589 --> 10:10.288
but I did masturbate to the one

10:10.390 --> 10:11.924
with Justin Timberlake on the cover

10:12.025 --> 10:13.959
for, like, all of 2003.

10:14.061 --> 10:16.161
Oh, the one where he's
wearing the turquoise necklace.

10:16.263 --> 10:17.438
Yeah.

10:17.516 --> 10:19.419
I had to Sharpie it out so I could cum.

10:21.492 --> 10:23.859
- It is dumb to say this is fun?
- No.

10:23.961 --> 10:25.460
I'm having fun too.

10:25.563 --> 10:26.862
I just have to use the restroom.

10:26.964 --> 10:28.230
- Okay.
- And I may or may not

10:28.332 --> 10:30.065
stalk your social media while I'm away.

10:30.167 --> 10:32.100
Oh, I'm about to go deep.

10:35.740 --> 10:37.439
Okay.

10:37.542 --> 10:39.775
Let's see that body.

10:41.946 --> 10:44.379
Wait, where's the body?

10:56.160 --> 10:58.093
What?

10:59.752 --> 11:02.020
"Hate myself"?

11:02.123 --> 11:03.912
Okay.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.867
"Tell him stop"?

11:05.969 --> 11:07.436
Uh, excuse me?

11:07.538 --> 11:09.459
I need another drink,
and make it a triple.

11:09.537 --> 11:10.405
You were drinking wine.

11:10.507 --> 11:12.207
Yeah, I want a bottle of wine.

11:23.352 --> 11:24.485
Cary!

11:24.588 --> 11:26.420
- Cary, what's up?
- Hi, hey.

11:26.522 --> 11:28.756
Is this... is this not a church service?

11:28.858 --> 11:30.892
Christ, no. It's a photoshoot.

11:30.994 --> 11:32.426
Oh! Perfect, good.

11:32.528 --> 11:33.828
- Yes.
- Okay, do you want to wear

11:33.930 --> 11:35.863
a red Speedo or hold your balls?

11:35.966 --> 11:37.632
I guess, since we're in a church,

11:37.734 --> 11:39.467
- uh, red Speedo?
- Cool.

11:39.569 --> 11:42.070
- Colby can hold his balls.
- Mm-hmm.

11:47.677 --> 11:49.777
- Hello?
- Oh, hi.

11:49.879 --> 11:52.079
- It's Dallas.
- Hey, what's wrong?

11:52.181 --> 11:53.647
Sometimes I hate taking photos

11:53.749 --> 11:54.948
with the other guys.

11:55.050 --> 11:57.451
- I'm so ugly next to them.
- What?

11:57.553 --> 11:59.620
You're like, so hot it sucks.

11:59.722 --> 12:01.563
If this partition wasn't here,
I'd slap you.

12:01.618 --> 12:03.757
Thanks, Cary.

12:03.859 --> 12:05.593
- You're so funny.
- Okay, everyone!

12:05.694 --> 12:07.394
Get in position!

12:07.497 --> 12:10.030
I call dead center!

12:10.133 --> 12:11.965
Hey. How was stalking me?

12:12.067 --> 12:13.767
- Find anything good?
- Not really.

12:13.869 --> 12:15.436
Do you just, like...

12:15.538 --> 12:18.172
- Never go to the beach?
- Is everything okay?

12:18.274 --> 12:20.241
Your vibe feels harder.

12:20.343 --> 12:21.875
Actually, I was thinking

12:21.977 --> 12:23.977
we could play a sexy little game.

12:24.079 --> 12:27.547
It's called, "What Musician
Do You Hate?"

12:27.650 --> 12:29.315
Not sure how that's sexy, but...

12:29.417 --> 12:31.414
I guess Maroon 5 kind of sucks.

12:31.508 --> 12:33.486
No, like, who would you love to meet

12:33.588 --> 12:35.355
so that you can tell them "stop"?

12:35.457 --> 12:37.724
Um, Susan Boyle.

12:39.227 --> 12:40.560
You're so funny.

12:40.663 --> 12:42.228
You love to say mean little things,

12:42.330 --> 12:44.097
and you get away with it
because you have

12:44.199 --> 12:46.332
a hot accent and an uncut dick.

12:46.434 --> 12:47.534
Actually, I'm cut.

12:47.636 --> 12:49.102
I... I'm sorry, I take it back.

12:49.204 --> 12:50.837
Maroon 5 doesn't suck?

12:50.939 --> 12:52.539
No, of course they suck.
That's their whole point.

12:52.641 --> 12:54.941
I'm talking about my
little brother, ChaseDreams.

12:55.044 --> 12:57.410
- Is everything okay here?
- No. This man is cut,

12:57.512 --> 12:59.344
and he likes to hurt little boys.

13:00.148 --> 13:02.148
Okay, we got the timer on.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.482
And here we go.

13:04.686 --> 13:06.986
Ugh, you looking at
my weird shoulder hair?

13:07.088 --> 13:08.888
I know, I'm like an ugly werewolf

13:08.990 --> 13:10.156
- next to these guys.
- What?

13:10.257 --> 13:12.058
I would sacrifice years of my life

13:12.160 --> 13:13.492
for just one of your shoulders.

13:13.594 --> 13:15.594
Thanks, Cary. You're so funny.

13:16.764 --> 13:18.164
Um, that's a good idea.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.832
- Let's do, like, a funny one.
- Oh, yeah.

13:19.934 --> 13:21.145
- Okay, good, yeah.
- Okay, and...

13:21.248 --> 13:22.949
Good.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.470
Three, two, one...

13:27.541 --> 13:29.075
Wait, how did you guys pose?

13:29.100 --> 13:30.232
Do you need me to call the police?

13:30.286 --> 13:31.943
- What did this man do?
- Yes!

13:32.045 --> 13:33.178
He posted mean jokes about my brother

13:33.279 --> 13:34.579
online six months ago.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.214
I can't call the police for that.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.481
And then he screen-shotted those jokes

13:37.584 --> 13:39.784
- and posted them again.
- I'll call the police.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.786
Oh! Well, well, well.

13:41.888 --> 13:43.788
Look who it is, Paul.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.024
- ChaseDreams.
<i>- Brooke?</i>

13:46.126 --> 13:47.425
Oh, my God, what's happening?

13:47.527 --> 13:48.526
Exactly what you wanted.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.021
<i>- Hello?</i>
- You're meeting ChaseDreams.

13:50.092 --> 13:51.153
Tell him "stop."

13:51.178 --> 13:52.330
<i>What? How do I make it stop?</i>

13:52.432 --> 13:53.564
Buddy, are you okay?

13:53.666 --> 13:54.766
Your face looks bad.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.034
Oh, so his face looks bad

13:56.136 --> 13:58.103
and his voice is bad?

13:58.205 --> 13:59.904
You've got a lot of nerve
tonight, buddy.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.606
<i>- Brooke, where are you?</i>
- I'm sorry for what I posted.

14:01.708 --> 14:02.941
He's a good singer.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.375
He's not a singer. He's an artist.

14:04.477 --> 14:05.643
But his face is covered in blood.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.111
What?

14:07.213 --> 14:09.480
Oh, my God, Chase.
The fish oil... okay, um...

14:09.582 --> 14:11.349
<i>- I need help.</i>
- I'm coming right home.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.284
Just tilt your head back, okay?

14:14.920 --> 14:17.121
I hope you learned your lesson.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.190
I think my caption's
gonna be how Christmas

14:20.293 --> 14:24.395
is a time for all people to
be thankful and to give back.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.464
Mine's either "Lucy
in the sky with diamonds"

14:26.566 --> 14:27.931
or something more about Christmas.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.033
Mine's gonna be #ChristmasGoals.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.669
Aww, I love that.

14:31.771 --> 14:33.203
So funny you guys
are doing Christmas captions

14:33.306 --> 14:34.705
this far from Christmas.

14:34.807 --> 14:36.707
Well, we're not gonna post them now.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.809
We're gonna post them on Christmas.

14:38.911 --> 14:40.343
What?

14:40.445 --> 14:41.979
We look way too fat after Thanksgiving,

14:42.081 --> 14:43.914
so we take the Christmas pics
ahead of time.

14:44.016 --> 14:46.150
How are these Christmas pics?

14:46.252 --> 14:47.785
Church plus red Speedos.

14:48.720 --> 14:49.820
God damn it.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.960
He's so funny.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.038
So I think the takeaway
is that I need to date guys

14:55.109 --> 14:57.960
who literally have no idea who Chase is.

14:58.046 --> 15:00.460
I think the takeaway
is "no more fish oil."

15:00.538 --> 15:01.796
Yeah, we are off of that.

15:01.882 --> 15:03.884
Oh, hey, did you get
all the followers you needed?

15:03.983 --> 15:07.253
No! I even tried making an ASMR video.

15:07.324 --> 15:08.879
One of those whisper videos?

15:08.981 --> 15:10.714
Ain't right, ain't natural.

15:10.816 --> 15:13.217
Yeah, I actually
lost followers on that video,

15:13.319 --> 15:16.353
so now I need 10,073 by tomorrow.

15:16.455 --> 15:17.487
Wait.

15:17.589 --> 15:18.923
Who's this skank?

15:22.428 --> 15:24.061
Oh, my God, it's Colby.

15:24.163 --> 15:25.595
"Wanna come hike with us, bitch?

15:25.697 --> 15:27.831
We got an extra animal onesie."

15:27.934 --> 15:29.366
- Eww.
- Hiking in onesies?

15:29.468 --> 15:30.600
Do you know how many photos
they're gonna take?

15:30.702 --> 15:31.969
Okay, I gotta go.

15:32.071 --> 15:33.370
I think I should do something
to my hair,

15:33.472 --> 15:34.471
'cause their hair is always so cool.

15:34.573 --> 15:35.639
I'm just gonna...

15:35.741 --> 15:38.574
Are you becoming an Instagay?

15:38.676 --> 15:39.842
What? No. No.

15:39.945 --> 15:40.843
I just want to book this miniseries.

15:40.946 --> 15:42.011
Okay, bye.

15:42.113 --> 15:44.613
Good luck on all your dates today.

15:44.715 --> 15:46.482
Bye.

15:48.519 --> 15:50.586
So you've never heard of ChaseDreams

15:50.688 --> 15:52.221
- or his music?
- Nah.

15:52.324 --> 15:54.590
- I don't know who that is.
- Perfect.

15:54.692 --> 15:56.926
Only music I listen to is Phish.

15:57.028 --> 15:59.728
Seen 'em live 712 times.

16:01.532 --> 16:03.099
And then, like, the whole Uber

16:03.201 --> 16:04.600
reeked of taco salad.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.369
I'm like, "I have to give
this guy five stars.

16:06.471 --> 16:07.870
I feel so bad."

16:07.973 --> 16:09.605
Great story, five stars.

16:09.707 --> 16:11.940
But, guys, uh, right here
is very picturesque.

16:12.042 --> 16:13.408
Could we take a picture here, maybe?

16:13.510 --> 16:15.277
Cary, you're seriously cracking me up.

16:17.481 --> 16:19.681
No, I haven't heard
of ChaseDreams or Phish.

16:19.783 --> 16:21.883
- I... I don't like music.
- Hot.

16:21.986 --> 16:23.918
- What do you like?
- Books.

16:24.021 --> 16:25.753
Books, I love.

16:25.856 --> 16:28.656
I love reading books,
talking about books.

16:28.758 --> 16:30.258
But then I was like,
instead of just telling her

16:30.361 --> 16:31.759
the truth, I'll just let her have it.

16:31.862 --> 16:33.150
Like, it doesn't hurt me.
You know what I mean?

16:33.221 --> 16:34.696
Hey, guys, what about this?

16:34.798 --> 16:36.564
What about this?

16:36.666 --> 16:38.566
What a funny image, right?

16:38.668 --> 16:40.035
Imagine scrolling past this.

16:40.137 --> 16:42.971
- Me as a hot cow.
- Oh, my God, a baby bird!

16:43.073 --> 16:44.094
What?

16:44.148 --> 16:46.107
- Out here?
- Oh, my God!

16:46.209 --> 16:48.275
Aww!

16:48.362 --> 16:49.641
So nice to meet you.

16:49.703 --> 16:52.871
Congrats again on getting
rescued from that basement!

16:55.718 --> 16:56.583
You okay?

16:56.685 --> 16:58.219
Can I get you anything?

16:58.321 --> 17:01.889
Yeah, you can knock me out
and wake me when I'm dead.

17:01.991 --> 17:04.224
- Horse troubles?
- What?

17:04.327 --> 17:05.893
No, didn't you just see

17:05.994 --> 17:07.294
all those awful dates I was on?

17:07.396 --> 17:08.628
Yeah.

17:08.731 --> 17:10.998
- Not a winner in the bunch.
- No.

17:11.099 --> 17:14.035
I... I just started dating
because I was so consumed

17:14.137 --> 17:16.503
with work, and then it just
ended up being more work.

17:16.605 --> 17:18.506
- You know what my sister did?
- I don't.

17:18.607 --> 17:21.607
My sister was so fed up
with the dating scene

17:21.709 --> 17:24.144
that she posted an ad
saying that she would be

17:24.246 --> 17:26.811
wearing a red dress
standing in Madison Square Park

17:26.915 --> 17:29.715
holding a single red rose,

17:29.817 --> 17:31.684
and she invited any handsome bachelor

17:31.786 --> 17:34.454
to come by, sweep her off her feet.

17:34.556 --> 17:37.123
She's now been married eight years.

17:38.093 --> 17:39.926
Nuh-uh.

17:40.028 --> 17:41.127
That is so dumb.

17:41.229 --> 17:43.296
I would never do that in a million...

17:48.736 --> 17:50.670
Oh, my God, yes.

17:50.772 --> 17:52.472
Okay. Beautiful, right?

17:52.574 --> 17:54.128
Yep, so let's take a picture.

17:54.153 --> 17:55.084
Huh?

17:55.109 --> 17:56.627
I said let's take a picture right here

17:56.704 --> 17:58.671
with this beautiful... lake.

17:58.717 --> 18:00.717
Oh, we're just here for the nature.

18:00.781 --> 18:02.881
It's No-Post Sunday.

18:02.983 --> 18:05.150
"No-Post Sunday"?

18:05.252 --> 18:07.619
Then why the hell
am I hanging out with you?

18:07.721 --> 18:10.389
- Excuse me?
- Cameron, what's happening?

18:10.491 --> 18:12.291
Cary's not being funny.

18:17.731 --> 18:20.799
<i>♪ If ever ♪</i>

18:20.901 --> 18:23.702
<i>♪ Love was real ♪</i>

18:23.804 --> 18:26.305
Are you... Brooke?

18:26.407 --> 18:28.039
Wow.

18:29.876 --> 18:30.976
You're gorgeous.

18:31.078 --> 18:32.978
So are you.

18:33.080 --> 18:34.843
I can't believe it.

18:34.913 --> 18:37.215
I mean, you knew nothing about me,

18:37.317 --> 18:40.018
and you saw an ad on Craigslist and...

18:40.120 --> 18:42.687
and decided to take a chance
on a stranger

18:42.789 --> 18:44.388
in Madison Square Park.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.891
That's...

18:46.994 --> 18:48.593
pathetic.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.096
You're a loser. I'm a loser.

18:51.197 --> 18:52.497
I'm sorry.

18:52.599 --> 18:53.999
I have to leave.

18:57.037 --> 18:58.770
I'm a loser?

18:58.872 --> 19:00.105
If we're not taking pictures,

19:00.206 --> 19:02.007
what's with these stupid onesies?

19:02.109 --> 19:03.374
They're comfy.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.875
Not everything we do
is to get a picture.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.877
Cary, were you just, like, using us

19:06.979 --> 19:08.746
to leech off our followers?

19:08.848 --> 19:09.947
Cary, we thought you liked us

19:10.049 --> 19:11.782
for who we are, not our work.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.717
You call what you do "work"?

19:13.819 --> 19:16.320
All you do is get naked
and post pictures

19:16.422 --> 19:17.921
and have sex with each other!

19:18.024 --> 19:19.390
We don't have sex with each other.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.192
What? Why don't you?

19:21.294 --> 19:23.427
- We're virgins.
- And I'm straight.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.363
And I used to be fat
but now I have two nieces.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.465
That's not a thing, Drake.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.167
Okay, that's the problem with you guys.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.768
You don't do anything!

19:30.870 --> 19:32.670
I actually do something.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.238
- I act.
- Like what?

19:34.340 --> 19:37.041
- What are you in?
- I'm trying to do something,

19:37.143 --> 19:40.310
but the way this business works
is you gotta do stupid shit

19:40.412 --> 19:42.245
like this to even get to that level.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.048
So I'm gonna go over here,

19:44.150 --> 19:45.749
and I'm gonna pose
like a little pouty cow,

19:45.851 --> 19:48.819
and you're gonna take a picture
and fucking tag me!

19:48.921 --> 19:51.088
Wait, are you filming?
Please don't film.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.573
- "Do not trust this thirsty..."
- Don't.

19:54.659 --> 19:56.760
- "Shady bitch..."
- Cameron, no.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.595
"@CaryDubek."

19:58.698 --> 19:59.730
No, please don't post that.
Please don't.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.765
- Sad.
- Please don't.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.805
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.641
Wait, I just got 100 new followers.

20:12.778 --> 20:14.744
Could you actually tweet that?

20:16.592 --> 20:17.924
Oh, yeah.

20:18.026 --> 20:19.358
Hey...

20:19.460 --> 20:21.695
What should we use instead of fish oil?

20:21.797 --> 20:24.363
Oh, um...

20:24.465 --> 20:25.799
I don't know.

20:25.901 --> 20:28.034
I think Chase might like flaxseed.

20:28.136 --> 20:30.369
But then again, he might not
like flaxseed.

20:30.471 --> 20:31.871
Yeah, I didn't end up getting the part,

20:31.973 --> 20:33.239
but it was down to me and one other guy,

20:33.341 --> 20:34.741
which is the closet I've ever gotten.

20:34.843 --> 20:37.143
- Who ended up getting it?
- Frankie Grande.

20:37.245 --> 20:38.377
He brought someone to eat his ass

20:38.479 --> 20:40.346
at the audition, so...

20:40.448 --> 20:42.682
Sorry again that I asked
if your brother could tag me.

20:42.784 --> 20:43.859
It's okay.

20:43.945 --> 20:45.418
Sorry I asked him to tag me instead.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.320
No, no, he's your brother.

20:47.422 --> 20:48.654
- Use him if you got him.
- Yeah.

20:48.757 --> 20:49.956
Yes.

20:50.058 --> 20:52.692
Shame, whispered apologies.

20:52.794 --> 20:54.397
Now, that's a gay sex scene.

20:54.483 --> 20:55.695
- Oh, thank you.
- Thanks.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.163
<i>- Yeah, thank you.
- Sorry, sorry.</i>

20:58.266 --> 20:59.699
<i>- Sorry.
- No, no, no, I'm sorry.</i>

20:59.795 --> 21:01.716
So you need a great deal of heat.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.748
1,700 degrees Celsius,

21:03.834 --> 21:06.537
which is about 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

21:06.623 --> 21:09.090
Uh, so it's not gonna get
that hot on Earth.

21:09.185 --> 21:10.711
You won't see any beaches...

21:10.782 --> 21:11.818
Made of glass.

21:11.920 --> 21:14.438
Um, it's fascinating.

21:14.605 --> 21:16.124
Maybe she saw your
pubes once and she's like,

21:16.149 --> 21:17.632
- "all I see are Jimmy's pubes."
- Yeah.

21:17.657 --> 21:19.773
That sounds like what
a principle would say.

21:22.267 --> 21:24.134
Hey, guys, welcome to
The Other Show again.

21:24.135 --> 21:25.967
- My name is Chris.
- I'm Sarah.

21:25.992 --> 21:28.605
And we're here with
Drew and Heléne, and Jimmy

21:28.606 --> 21:30.942
and Navaris who play a
couple of the Insta Gays

21:30.943 --> 21:31.944
in this episode.

21:33.779 --> 21:35.613
We're very excited
for this episode to air

21:35.614 --> 21:37.982
and to shoot this episode
'cause it really made us laugh,

21:37.983 --> 21:39.488
and you guys are so funny in this.

21:39.513 --> 21:40.551
Thank you.

21:40.576 --> 21:42.787
Those characters that
are bitchy gay guys is such

21:42.788 --> 21:46.223
a stereotype, so to play
someone who's, they have no...

21:46.248 --> 21:47.768
like they're just really kind.

21:47.793 --> 21:48.994
- Yeah.
- Oh, no, totally, yeah.

21:48.995 --> 21:50.536
- Drew's the villain.
- It was so great

21:50.561 --> 21:52.051
- that my character's the villain.
- Drew's the absolute villain.

21:52.076 --> 21:55.333
It's so, it was so refreshing
to be like, 'Yeah their not

21:55.334 --> 21:56.400
bad, I am bad.'

21:56.401 --> 21:57.236
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:57.237 --> 21:58.929
I'm using them.

21:58.954 --> 22:01.506
All you do it get
naked and post pictures

22:01.507 --> 22:02.841
and have sex with each other.

22:02.842 --> 22:04.342
We don't have sex with each other.

22:04.343 --> 22:06.277
What? Why don't you?

22:06.278 --> 22:09.147
I had to go through and
unfollow a bunch of these guys

22:09.148 --> 22:12.015
because I would just
like, be out in the world,

22:12.016 --> 22:14.209
and I would be technically
looking at porn.

22:14.234 --> 22:15.162
Oh, yeah!

22:15.187 --> 22:17.638
Because I'd be like hiding my phone
like over in the corner.

22:17.663 --> 22:20.792
And I was like, I can't just
be looking at a man's full butt

22:20.793 --> 22:22.527
at the doctor's office waiting room.

22:22.528 --> 22:25.363
But it happens suddenly
enough where you follow one,

22:25.388 --> 22:26.332
- then two, and then...
- Yes!

22:26.333 --> 22:28.253
in a year you're like this is
porn I'm scrolling through.

22:28.278 --> 22:30.768
He said when we would
like researching-ish

22:30.769 --> 22:33.370
the Insta-Gay culture, any
profile I went to was like,

22:33.371 --> 22:35.674
followed by Drew Darker.

22:37.977 --> 22:39.379
Are you Brooke?

22:40.721 --> 22:42.047
Wow!

22:43.215 --> 22:44.548
I was wondering about the model.

22:44.549 --> 22:46.450
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, in Madison Square Park.

22:46.451 --> 22:47.652
Yes, I'll talk about it.

22:47.653 --> 22:49.887
You see beautiful people
like that in person,

22:49.888 --> 22:51.523
and it's like truly shocking.

22:51.524 --> 22:53.625
It was shocking when I watched it.

22:53.626 --> 22:55.159
Like a drawing, he looks like a drawing.

22:55.160 --> 22:56.893
He looks like a drawing,
it's unbelievable to me,

22:56.894 --> 22:58.129
I feel like I wanted to ask him

22:58.130 --> 22:59.397
but I didn't quite
know how to phrase it,

22:59.398 --> 23:00.899
like what is it like to look like you?

23:00.900 --> 23:02.430
- I was mad at you.
- Like how has that been?

23:02.455 --> 23:04.656
But he would have killed her
though, like clearly like...

23:04.681 --> 23:05.758
- Who shows up like...
- Yeah, like 100%

23:05.783 --> 23:07.602
- in the middle of the day?
- That was the original joke, yeah!

23:07.627 --> 23:09.340
He was originally going to say,

23:09.341 --> 23:10.594
"Now I have to find
someone else to kill."

23:10.619 --> 23:12.275
How come you guys cut it?

23:12.300 --> 23:13.745
I dunno, we liked him being like...

23:13.746 --> 23:16.064
- Liked a very handsome man saying, 'I'm a loser.'
- ...left in an existential crisis.

23:16.089 --> 23:18.041
That was actually one of my favorite
things to shoot as well,

23:18.066 --> 23:19.712
because we shot that
in Madison Square Park,

23:19.737 --> 23:21.987
- like in the early, early morning.
- Yeah.

23:21.988 --> 23:25.055
And shooting in New York City
in like, iconic areas

23:25.056 --> 23:27.090
like that in the morning, they're empty

23:27.091 --> 23:29.594
and you sort of watch
the city come alive

23:29.595 --> 23:32.160
while you're standing there,
and it's really amazing.

23:32.832 --> 23:34.500
Let's see that body.

23:37.346 --> 23:39.433
Wait, where's the body?

23:39.458 --> 23:40.673
This is sort of an embarrassing thing,

23:40.698 --> 23:42.845
but maybe it will spark something,

23:42.870 --> 23:44.242
but you go on a date with that guy,

23:44.243 --> 23:46.277
Paul, from Rolling
Stone, but we were like,

23:46.278 --> 23:51.284
oh what's a good douchey Twitter
handle for a guy like this.

23:51.309 --> 23:53.565
And we used my real one from high school

23:53.590 --> 23:54.682
because it was so douchey.

23:54.707 --> 23:57.088
My AIM screen-name, in high school

23:57.089 --> 23:58.957
was King of Sarcasm Zero-One.

23:58.958 --> 24:00.424
- That's me!
- No, it's not!

24:00.449 --> 24:02.726
I must have been thinking like,
I am pretty sarcastic.

24:03.762 --> 24:05.296
In fact, I'm the king of it.

24:05.297 --> 24:07.966
I had just ended a
production of West Side Story,

24:07.967 --> 24:12.570
and I was Baby John, and so
my screen was Baby John Five.

24:12.571 --> 24:14.873
Isn't that just like...

24:14.874 --> 24:18.208
- That's okay.
- It's sad, you do one production.

24:18.209 --> 24:20.310
You were proud of that
production and that performance!

24:20.311 --> 24:22.648
It's so embarrassing, like Baby John...

24:22.649 --> 24:24.749
It's very literal to
be like, I was Baby John,

24:24.750 --> 24:26.650
my screen-name should be Baby John.

24:26.651 --> 24:27.789
Well, yeah, it is kind of like

24:27.814 --> 24:29.787
when you are in high school,
like one thing you've done,

24:29.788 --> 24:30.887
you make your entire personality.

24:30.888 --> 24:32.123
- It's a big deal!
- Yeah.

24:32.124 --> 24:33.391
Oh, as a matter of
fact, I was a big deal

24:33.416 --> 24:35.326
in West Side Story, and
it wasn't my screen-name,

24:35.327 --> 24:37.330
but my class ring says,
"A Big Deal," on it.

24:37.331 --> 24:38.563
- Oh, no!
- Whoa, that's good!

24:38.564 --> 24:40.575
Wow, West Side Story fucked us up.

24:41.500 --> 24:46.694
Mine was Belleoftheball,
because of a Guster song,

24:46.749 --> 24:49.006
where that is a lyric, 103, which is

24:49.007 --> 24:51.399
where in the song, that
lyric first appears.

24:51.424 --> 24:52.516
Whoa...

24:52.541 --> 24:54.612
But the Belle was spelled with an E,

24:54.613 --> 24:57.298
because that was my
favorite Disney princess.

24:57.323 --> 24:58.470
- That's rough.
- Oh, my...

24:58.495 --> 25:00.431
- Isn't that just like, layers of sadness?
- There's so many layers.

25:00.456 --> 25:02.189
- Honestly though if I'd known
- This is so earnest.

25:02.214 --> 25:03.345
Sarah in in high school,
I would have been like,

25:03.384 --> 25:07.058
"you are deep girl, I wanna be like you."

25:07.083 --> 25:09.160
Mine, was complicated,

25:09.161 --> 25:12.196
because I'm a big X-Men fan.

25:12.197 --> 25:13.530
- Okay.
- Okay.

25:13.531 --> 25:15.166
So I wanted an X in it, and my mom

25:15.167 --> 25:17.500
had a porcelain figure of a swan...

25:17.501 --> 25:19.170
Oh, God.

25:19.171 --> 25:20.539

left, and it was there,

25:20.540 --> 25:23.634

25:23.659 --> 25:27.616
S W A N E X, and it
sounds like a cleaner

25:27.641 --> 25:30.449

- Wait, S W A N E X?

25:30.450 --> 25:33.282
Yeah, S W A N E X,
and it was like, Swanex.

25:33.307 --> 25:36.221
You did, like, what they
do in bad writing in comedy,

25:36.246 --> 25:38.930
then they're like, my name
is Bob Treestonefloor.

25:39.891 --> 25:41.058
Let's do like, a funny one.

25:41.059 --> 25:42.394
- Oh, yeah, okay good, yeah.
- Yeah!

25:42.395 --> 25:44.230
- Okay, and...
- Good.

25:45.129 --> 25:47.397
Three, two, one.

25:49.234 --> 25:51.002
Wait, how did you guys pose?

25:51.003 --> 25:52.570
So we asked you guys to show us

25:52.571 --> 25:55.171
pictures that you had
posted on the internet,

25:55.172 --> 25:57.342
where you were being thirsty.

25:57.343 --> 25:59.543
Okay, this is Navaris.

25:59.544 --> 26:01.512
- That is good!
- Oh, wow!

26:01.513 --> 26:02.714
Is this your hair?

26:02.715 --> 26:03.914
That is good!

26:03.915 --> 26:05.515
Yeah, that was me in like, 2016.

26:05.516 --> 26:06.717
Wow!

26:06.718 --> 26:07.851
We were like, send
the picture that's like,

26:07.852 --> 26:09.486
we can kind of like, laugh about

26:09.487 --> 26:10.688
'cause you're just too thirsty in it,

26:10.689 --> 26:12.089
and we got this and we were like...

26:12.090 --> 26:13.390
No, that's fine, he

26:13.391 --> 26:14.993
That's just not good...

26:14.994 --> 26:16.394
I would love to see that on my scroll.

26:16.395 --> 26:18.495
I'm really repressed, I think,

26:18.496 --> 26:19.664

26:19.665 --> 26:21.599

- Yeah.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.101
Yeah!

26:23.102 --> 26:25.435
We asked Drew for a thirsty photo,

26:25.436 --> 26:27.171
and it's him as a speck!

26:27.172 --> 26:28.207
You have to zoom in

26:28.208 --> 26:30.074
so much to see any body.

26:30.075 --> 26:31.508
- But that's what you said.
- Yeah!

26:31.509 --> 26:33.111
You were like, if someone's
going to "work for it,"

26:33.112 --> 26:35.398
- Yeah!
- Then they're gonna get the reward.

26:35.423 --> 26:37.352
If they really zoom in,

26:37.377 --> 26:40.250
you will see a blurry,
kind-of-good chest.

26:40.251 --> 26:42.086
- Let's show Jimmy's.
- Okay, Jimmy's is good.

26:42.111 --> 26:43.553
This is also good.

26:43.554 --> 26:45.923
Whoa!

26:45.924 --> 26:47.125
How did you get that?

26:47.126 --> 26:48.793
How did you get that?

26:48.794 --> 26:50.226
I'm freaking out.

26:50.227 --> 26:52.128
This is like, Justin Theroux!

26:52.129 --> 26:54.531
And by the way, when you
post a thirsty photo,

26:54.532 --> 26:56.801
your thirst gets quenched!

26:56.802 --> 26:58.859
People like that shit!

26:58.884 --> 27:00.085
- That's why people do it.
- Yeah!

27:00.110 --> 27:01.540
