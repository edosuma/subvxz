00:41.141 --> 00:43.200
My name is Nick.

00:43.376 --> 00:46.368
My last name, which I loathe,
is Twisp.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.911
Which would be a nice name...

00:48.081 --> 00:51.278
...if I planned on becoming
an evil nurse in a mental institution.

00:52.585 --> 00:54.917
I am a voracious reader
of classic prose...

00:55.088 --> 00:56.749
...an aspiring novelist...

00:56.923 --> 00:59.118
...and feel the world would be
a better place...

00:59.292 --> 01:02.523
...if every radio station played
Sinatra 's "My One and Only Love"...

01:02.695 --> 01:03.957
...at least once an hour.

01:04.129 --> 01:05.893
Needless to say, I'm still a virgin.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.893
I live in Oakland
with my charming mother.

01:12.605 --> 01:14.698
-Estelle....
-Her latest boyfriend, Jerry...

01:14.874 --> 01:16.899
...is a truck driver
and pathological liar.

01:17.077 --> 01:20.103
If a woman answered the phone,
it was probably just the maid.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.248
He's a real prize.

01:22.549 --> 01:24.608
I'm gonna bite you.

01:24.784 --> 01:26.217
No.

01:27.987 --> 01:29.682
-Hi, Nick.
-Hi.

01:29.856 --> 01:32.450
-Have three more for you.
-Oh, thanks, Mr. Ferguson.

01:32.625 --> 01:36.152
Our neighbor Mr. Ferguson likes to
bring us mail from our mailbox.

01:36.329 --> 01:40.060
He's a former activist with
a bleeding heart and too much time.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.724
He's always getting arrested
for staging protests...

01:42.902 --> 01:45.132
...and harboring illegal aliens
in his basement.

01:45.305 --> 01:48.331
He's a good man, but very strange.

01:50.810 --> 01:52.710
My dad is currently in between jobs.

01:52.879 --> 01:54.847
He would love
to not have to work at all...

01:55.014 --> 01:57.983
...but he's burdened with crippling
child-support payments.

01:58.151 --> 02:00.142
When am I gonna start getting
an allowance?

02:00.320 --> 02:02.447
I'm getting tired of not having
a cell phone.

02:02.622 --> 02:05.489
I'm afraid you're gonna have to
work it out with your mom.

02:05.658 --> 02:08.149
-Lacey is Dad's girlfriend.
-Baby...

02:08.328 --> 02:10.558
...I cooked for you.

02:10.729 --> 02:12.357
-You made me a snack.
-Come here.

02:12.532 --> 02:15.330
She's 25
and a budding cosmetologist.

02:15.502 --> 02:18.403
-I love it.
-Does my baby like it?

02:18.571 --> 02:21.301
It's amazing
and incredibly irritating to me...

02:21.474 --> 02:24.637
...how much action everyone
around me seems to be getting.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.210
With one exception.

02:27.380 --> 02:30.144
My sister saw Millie holding hands
with some college guy.

02:30.316 --> 02:34.343
My friend Lefty's had a crush on a girl
named Millie Filbert since third grade.

02:34.521 --> 02:36.921
He's the only person
more miserable than I am.

02:37.090 --> 02:41.254
You know, I've been taping my dick
to my right leg at night with duct tape.

02:41.427 --> 02:43.657
I think of Millie
in her green summery dress...

02:43.830 --> 02:46.390
...and I get hard.
It starts to push against the tape--

02:46.566 --> 02:48.932
Putting counter-rotational
tension on the shaft.

02:49.102 --> 02:50.228
-Right.
-That's nice.

02:50.403 --> 02:52.735
In case you haven't heard,
Lefty's erect member...

02:52.906 --> 02:56.137
...takes a sudden and dramatic turn
to the east about midway up.

02:56.309 --> 02:58.402
-War.
-Well, you might wanna get it fixed...

02:58.578 --> 03:00.205
...before you ask Millie out.

03:00.380 --> 03:01.870
That's very true.

03:02.048 --> 03:04.346
What if I shove it up the wrong hole?

03:04.517 --> 03:07.452
What if we go out
and she doesn't even like me?

03:07.620 --> 03:09.645
We get to know each other
and she hates me?

03:09.822 --> 03:11.380
We get married and have a kid...

03:11.558 --> 03:14.652
...but he's not good at anything,
has no talents?

03:16.429 --> 03:18.260
I wonder if it's worth it.

03:19.332 --> 03:22.733
Either way, you probably wanna
get your dick straightened out.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.530
-ls Jerry here?
-He just went out.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.437
That hunk-of-shit Chevy he sold us...

03:30.610 --> 03:32.737
...made it 1 7 miles
before the engine blew up.

03:32.912 --> 03:35.403
And we found evidence of a banana
in the transmission.

03:35.582 --> 03:37.209
So he owes us $900.

03:37.383 --> 03:41.114
Well, I'm quite certain that he spent
that $900 on his new Lincoln.

03:41.287 --> 03:44.723
Maybe you'd better come back
and speak with him directly.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.883
He's a pretty stubborn man,
so you might have to get physical.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.085
That can be arranged.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.588
After living in Oakland
for 16 years...

03:52.765 --> 03:55.962
...I've noticed it's filled with women
who have zero interest in me.

03:56.135 --> 03:57.466
Hey, Karen.

03:57.637 --> 03:58.899
Nick.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.632
Oh, right. Physics?

04:01.808 --> 04:03.776
American History. You were close.

04:04.644 --> 04:05.975
What is that?

04:06.145 --> 04:08.807
Oh, La Strada. It's a Fellini movie.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.246
So random.

04:11.417 --> 04:14.682
They were out of Miss Congeniality 2:
Armed and Fabulous...

04:14.854 --> 04:16.651
...so I went for a random--

04:16.822 --> 04:20.623
-Chad. Fuck you.
-Oh, fuck you, you love it.

04:20.793 --> 04:24.024
Hey, does that movie come with
tampons for your pussy?

04:24.197 --> 04:27.132
You know, Chad,
I'll be upset if it doesn't.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.430
In the movies,
the good guy gets the girl.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.936
In real life it's usually the prick.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.369
Nick, get out here.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.438
Nick.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.336
Nick.

04:41.814 --> 04:44.647
Nick, do you know anything
about this?

04:44.817 --> 04:47.752
Oh, yeah. Those sailors came by.
They want their money back.

04:47.920 --> 04:51.151
Apparently there was some sort of
banana in the transmission.

04:54.394 --> 04:56.225
You tell them I was coming back?

04:56.396 --> 04:58.489
Now, why would I do that?

04:59.232 --> 05:00.961
Jerry, what are you gonna do?

05:01.134 --> 05:02.567
Go get the Lincoln washed.

05:02.735 --> 05:04.293
You're leaving?

05:04.470 --> 05:07.439
What happens when
that sailor comes back?

05:08.007 --> 05:10.202
To escape the threat
of ill-tempered sailors...

05:10.376 --> 05:12.367
...we're going to Clear Lake
for a week...

05:12.545 --> 05:14.945
...to stay in a cabin owned by
a friend of Jerry's.

05:15.114 --> 05:18.948
Since I have no life,
I figure I have nothing to lose.

05:22.288 --> 05:24.188
We're going on vacation.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.528
Jerry.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.362
I thought you said it was a cabin.

07:18.738 --> 07:21.434
Come on, Estelle.
It's real cute on the inside.

07:40.226 --> 07:42.626
I say we let the kid do the dishes...

07:42.795 --> 07:45.491
...and you and l
retire to the master bedroom.

07:54.874 --> 07:57.001
Do you think Jerry is
someone that I can...

07:57.176 --> 07:59.644
...Iook forward to having around
for years to come?

07:59.812 --> 08:03.373
Nick, how many men are interested
in a woman who's 48 years old...

08:03.549 --> 08:06.177
...has a kid, no money
and stretch marks?

08:06.352 --> 08:08.650
I think you're selling yourself short,
Mom.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.654
Leave open the possibility
of a stretch-mark fetishist.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.190
Oh, watch your smart mouth.

08:18.764 --> 08:21.790
So you're gonna do the dishes,
okay, hon?

08:21.968 --> 08:24.664
Gerald and I will be in back,
playing Scrabble.

08:58.337 --> 08:59.861
Your robe's open.

09:30.836 --> 09:33.669
-So are you staying near here?
-We live down the block.

09:33.839 --> 09:35.830
Oh, spitting distance.

09:36.008 --> 09:37.475
So to speak.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.242
Hi, Stuck-up.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.405
-Hi.
-Honey, this is Sheeni Saunders.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.347
She stopped by to introduce herself.
Isn't that neighborly?

09:46.986 --> 09:49.580
-Yes. Yes.
-She's on her way to the store.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.814
I volunteered your help
carrying her bags.

09:53.559 --> 09:55.288
Sounds fun.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.758
You know, your family's arrival...

09:59.932 --> 10:02.696
...excited considerable interest
among the residents.

10:03.235 --> 10:06.568
-Your father's beer cooler on the--
-Oh, no, he's not my father.

10:06.739 --> 10:08.297
Jerry's my mother's consort.

10:08.474 --> 10:11.068
He and l
have no blood links of any kind.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.906
Well, that seems to be
worth something.

10:20.152 --> 10:22.382
Yesterday the most exciting thing
in my life...

10:22.555 --> 10:26.252
...was the thought of Jerry being
beaten senseless by three sailors.

10:26.425 --> 10:30.225
Now I'm spending time
with a beautiful, interesting girl...

10:30.396 --> 10:32.159
...and I have no idea
how it happened.

10:32.331 --> 10:34.026
Here we are.

10:35.334 --> 10:36.961
Wow, a second floor.

10:37.136 --> 10:40.105
Yes. Father bought it so we could
look down on the world.

10:40.272 --> 10:41.705
What does your father do?

10:41.874 --> 10:43.466
He's a lawyer.

10:45.211 --> 10:47.406
Wow, this is really nice.

10:56.422 --> 10:59.118
-Where are your parents?
-They're at church.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.691
Would you like a tour?

11:02.862 --> 11:04.386
Sure.

11:04.864 --> 11:06.388
Kitchen.

11:07.566 --> 11:10.091
This is Mother's Farfisa organ.

11:11.137 --> 11:15.267
Father added this extension
so he could fit these 64 pipes in.

11:18.978 --> 11:20.775
Dining room.

11:22.314 --> 11:24.544
Here's a family portrait.

11:29.388 --> 11:31.982
And this is my room.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.465
Didn't you just love Breathless?

11:45.071 --> 11:46.936
Jean-Paul was completely gripping.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.739
If you like French people, I suppose.
Yeah.

11:50.176 --> 11:51.973
I can see it.

11:52.144 --> 11:54.135
I think my favorite film
was Tokyo Story.

11:54.313 --> 11:56.543
I just think Mizoguchi
is a great director.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.775
It's a great film.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.814
But wasn't that by Ozu?

12:05.224 --> 12:06.623
Who can say?

12:10.696 --> 12:13.062
There's nothing quite as good
as vinyl.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.564
Yeah, it's very textural.

12:18.537 --> 12:21.472
-Do you like Frank Sinatra?
-I do.

12:22.007 --> 12:24.874
But my all-time favorite is...

12:25.478 --> 12:28.072
...Serge Gainsbourg.

12:29.515 --> 12:31.574
So you really like the French,
don't you?

12:31.751 --> 12:33.343
I wanna live in France.

12:33.519 --> 12:35.919
I wanna live all over the world.

12:36.355 --> 12:39.324
I know there's so much more
than this out there.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.022
My parents are religious fanatics.

12:46.198 --> 12:47.961
They're exhausting.

12:57.843 --> 13:00.539
-Bye.
-Bye.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.143
Hey, Sheeni?

13:08.654 --> 13:12.488
Do you think you'd like to join me
at the beach tomorrow after breakfast?

13:12.892 --> 13:14.450
I'd love to.

13:31.510 --> 13:33.239
-Yes?
-Hello, Mr. Saunders. I'm Nick.

13:33.412 --> 13:35.437
I'm here to see Sheeni.

13:36.715 --> 13:39.047
I understand you've invited her
to the beach.

13:39.218 --> 13:40.708
That's right.

13:41.921 --> 13:44.412
Well, I trust, sir,
you are aware that in doing so...

13:44.590 --> 13:46.649
...you have entered into
an oral contract...

13:46.826 --> 13:48.384
...to perform in loco parentis...

13:48.561 --> 13:51.689
...i.e., to provide for
the safety and welfare...

13:51.864 --> 13:55.027
...of aforementioned minor female.

13:57.903 --> 14:00.599
-Ready?
-Very ready.

14:01.807 --> 14:03.331
Bye, Father.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.500
Goodbye, Mr. Saunders.

14:07.746 --> 14:10.977
Would you mind applying this
to my exposed areas?

14:11.650 --> 14:13.174
Sure.

14:44.650 --> 14:46.709
You get turned on easily.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.618
Don't stop, Nick. It's only natural.

14:52.591 --> 14:55.526
Girls are fortunate
in that it doesn't show.

14:55.694 --> 14:56.922
For all the world knows...

14:57.096 --> 14:59.826
...my vagina could be moist
with desire as we speak.

15:01.033 --> 15:02.591
Is it?

15:06.405 --> 15:07.838
Should we do my front now?

15:08.607 --> 15:10.006
Okay.

15:10.175 --> 15:11.904
I'm up for it.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.422
Thank you.

15:45.911 --> 15:47.811
What's your last name?

15:48.514 --> 15:50.106
Dillinger.

15:55.988 --> 15:57.615
Twisp.

16:05.297 --> 16:06.730
Sheeni Saunders.

16:07.333 --> 16:10.996
She's complicated, mischievous
and at this point...

16:11.170 --> 16:14.503
...I'd be willing to give up
everything in my life to be with her.

16:17.042 --> 16:21.240
Nick, you're very nice,
but I should tell you I have a boyfriend.

16:21.947 --> 16:23.244
Oh, I see.

16:23.682 --> 16:25.309
His name is Trent.

16:25.484 --> 16:28.510
We've been together
for a while, actually.

16:29.421 --> 16:31.013
What's he like?

16:31.290 --> 16:33.053
He's 1 7...

16:33.225 --> 16:35.716
...6'2", fluent in French...

16:35.894 --> 16:39.352
...plays the piano,
is a champion swimmer...

16:39.531 --> 16:42.625
...and writes futurist
percussive poetry.

16:43.035 --> 16:46.527
Oh, I'm not familiar with
futurist percussive poems.

16:46.705 --> 16:49.469
I could recite one of Trent's,
if you'd like.

16:49.641 --> 16:51.165
Please do.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.679
Ram dam 12

16:54.847 --> 16:56.178
Sizzle mop

16:56.615 --> 16:58.105
Crunch down

16:58.283 --> 17:00.114
Safety net

17:00.285 --> 17:03.482
Hot, hot, hot
Void

17:06.625 --> 17:08.718
Well, that certainly sounds like
a poem.

17:08.894 --> 17:10.862
Jeez, he sounds great.

17:11.195 --> 17:14.222
Well, you know, I also have
a sweetheart for the moment, so....

17:14.400 --> 17:16.960
Really? What's her name?

17:17.136 --> 17:20.571
Her name is Martha Singwall.
She's 1 6.

17:20.739 --> 17:23.037
She's got toasted almond hair, so....

17:23.208 --> 17:26.439
She's only just recently returned
from Nice...

17:26.612 --> 17:29.513
...where she's been conducting
sociological research...

17:29.681 --> 17:33.412
...on the assimilation problems
of ltalian immigrant workers...

17:33.585 --> 17:34.779
...down there.

17:34.953 --> 17:38.684
She's also a professional model
that specializes in lingerie.

17:38.857 --> 17:41.951
She likes me quite a bit.
She tells me that she loves my hair.

17:43.762 --> 17:47.095
-She sounds wonderful.
-Yes, I think you'd like her, Sheeni.

17:47.266 --> 17:50.565
Trent sounds great, too,
aside from being freakishly tall.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.364
He certainly does seem to have
a knack for...

17:53.539 --> 17:56.531
...smashing ungraceful words
together...

17:57.009 --> 17:58.738
...and deeming it a poem.

18:00.112 --> 18:02.512
Well, thanks for a lovely day, Nick.

18:02.681 --> 18:04.308
Don't mention it.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.577
I think of this girl being swept away
by some pretentious poet...

18:09.755 --> 18:11.416
...and it crushes me.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.023
She could never like me.

18:13.192 --> 18:16.821
Unless I decided to radically change
every detail of my personality...

18:16.995 --> 18:18.690
...I'm going to die a virgin.

18:31.076 --> 18:32.543
-Nick?
-Sheeni, nice to see you.

18:32.711 --> 18:34.906
I was going for a walk
and thought I'd drop by.

18:35.080 --> 18:38.277
I remembered that you lived here.
I'm sorry I got upset about Trent.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.645
It was immature.
I'm not normally like that.

18:40.819 --> 18:43.879
He sounds like a great guy.
I'd love to hear more of his poetry.

18:44.056 --> 18:46.217
Do you wanna go to the beach?
Or get breakfast?

18:46.391 --> 18:48.518
Actually, I'm going on a hike.

18:48.694 --> 18:49.854
I'd ask you to come...

18:50.028 --> 18:53.088
...but you haven't got boots,
provisions, maps or a compass.

18:53.265 --> 18:56.496
I do all my hiking freeform. Like
John Muir, I enter the wilderness...

18:56.668 --> 19:00.069
...with nothing more than my journal
and a child-like sense of wonder.

19:28.333 --> 19:31.268
What the hell is going on?
This is a private journal.

19:33.438 --> 19:35.633
Trent is not an affected twit.

19:35.807 --> 19:38.605
Sheeni, how would you like it
if I read your journal?

19:39.611 --> 19:41.203
Go ahead.

19:49.755 --> 19:52.155
It's written in a shorthand
of my own devising.

19:52.324 --> 19:54.417
A necessity for a girl
with Christian parents.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.026
What does this say?

19:56.195 --> 19:57.958
Wouldn't you like to know?

19:58.130 --> 20:01.293
That last passage would be
of particular interest to you.

20:01.466 --> 20:02.899
I doubt that.

20:03.068 --> 20:07.528
I have very little interest in reading
about Trent's beautiful shoulders.

20:10.409 --> 20:14.072
I haven't made love with Trent,
if that's what you wanna know.

20:15.380 --> 20:18.816
I've only made love once
and it was less than erotic.

20:20.586 --> 20:23.146
But I hear it gets better with practice.

20:26.258 --> 20:29.091
You're a virgin. I can tell.

20:35.267 --> 20:37.292
Kiss me, you weenie.

21:00.225 --> 21:02.090
Sheeni, I think I love you.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.353
Of course you do.

21:03.528 --> 21:05.496
Well, your hormones certainly do.

21:08.533 --> 21:09.761
Sheeni.

21:10.702 --> 21:12.499
Yes, Mother. I'm just here with Nick.

21:12.671 --> 21:15.003
Let's see this young heathen.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.533
Hello, Mrs. Saunders.
It's nice to meet you.

21:17.709 --> 21:19.472
I doubt that very much.

21:19.645 --> 21:22.079
-See you tomorrow, Nick.
-Okay. Goodbye, Sheeni.

21:22.247 --> 21:23.339
Goodbye, Mrs. Saunders.

21:23.515 --> 21:26.678
Look into your soul, young man,
before it's too late.

21:26.852 --> 21:28.376
I will.

21:32.090 --> 21:34.217
Jerry sniffed out a trailer
he wants to buy...

21:34.393 --> 21:36.020
...and insisted we go check it out.

21:36.194 --> 21:39.857
I told Sheeni I was going to
write a book about her.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.500
She said it was a terrible idea.

21:47.639 --> 21:52.008
Jerry, all the closets
are full of mouse doodies.

21:52.177 --> 21:54.042
-I might take 950.
-Nine hundred.

21:54.212 --> 21:56.373
-Nine-ten.
-We're in business.

21:57.849 --> 22:00.716
Oh, come here.
Come here, come here.

22:00.886 --> 22:03.912
Hello. Hello.

22:04.089 --> 22:06.284
Nicky, look, isn't he cute?

22:06.458 --> 22:08.392
He's adorable.

22:09.528 --> 22:10.825
How much?

22:11.229 --> 22:12.560
Ten dollars.

22:21.540 --> 22:24.168
All I have is a Subway card
with four stickers.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.069
Sold.

22:27.679 --> 22:29.977
Thank you, Nicky.

22:35.887 --> 22:39.084
I think I'm going to name him Albert.

22:39.257 --> 22:41.748
After Albert Camus.

22:57.676 --> 23:01.305
That night was my first indisputable
make-out session with a girl.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.971
After grappling in the warm darkness
with Sheeni...

23:04.149 --> 23:06.379
...I found this note in my back pocket.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.883
I thought she had been
caressing my ass.

23:11.456 --> 23:12.548
Dear Nick.

23:12.724 --> 23:15.056
Please excuse me
for reading your journal.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.923
I have found that people
who can resist temptation...

23:18.096 --> 23:21.395
...invariably lead
depressingly stunted lives.

23:21.566 --> 23:24.831
Naturally I was charmed
by what you wrote about me.

23:25.003 --> 23:28.439
Your contemplation of suicide
and your invention of Martha...

23:28.607 --> 23:32.509
...cannot help but evoke a strong
emotional response in my breast.

23:33.111 --> 23:34.601
We are both young.

23:34.780 --> 23:38.011
Let's just live
and what happens will happen.

23:38.183 --> 23:41.710
Yours affectionately, Sheeni.

23:51.463 --> 23:53.260
I have to leave today.

23:53.432 --> 23:57.698
Jerry threw his back out last night
in bed with my mother...

23:57.869 --> 24:01.965
...so he has to be reunited with
his painkillers back in Oakland.

24:02.808 --> 24:04.833
We're leaving in an hour.

24:06.945 --> 24:08.936
So this will be goodbye.

24:10.015 --> 24:11.482
Goodbye.

24:11.650 --> 24:13.550
You don't have to act so brave,
Sheeni.

24:13.718 --> 24:15.686
I wouldn't judge you
if you started to cry.

24:15.854 --> 24:18.721
No, Nicky. It's Albert.

24:18.890 --> 24:20.881
He snuck out of my room last night.

24:21.059 --> 24:24.392
When I woke up,
he had shredded the family Bible.

24:24.563 --> 24:26.394
My parents took it as a sign of evil.

24:26.565 --> 24:29.659
Now I have to find someone
who will take him.

24:29.835 --> 24:32.099
-Well, I'll take him.
-You will?

24:32.270 --> 24:36.172
I'll have to hide him from my mother
because she can't stand dogs...

24:36.341 --> 24:38.332
...but it's a risk I'm willing to take.

24:38.510 --> 24:40.478
He's our lovechild.

24:41.847 --> 24:43.872
Sheeni, I can't stand
the thought of you...

24:44.049 --> 24:47.576
...falling in love with some
egotistical poet while I'm gone.

24:47.752 --> 24:50.380
I've had a great time with you.

24:50.555 --> 24:52.682
It was a really lovely summer fling.

24:53.658 --> 24:56.923
But I can't put my whole life on hold.

24:58.063 --> 24:59.587
You don't even live here.

24:59.764 --> 25:02.892
But we could run away together.
We can escape our families...

25:03.068 --> 25:04.660
...Iive like outlaws together.

25:04.836 --> 25:08.169
No offense, Nicky,
but it's not exactly in your constitution.

25:08.340 --> 25:12.106
What if my dad could get a job here
in Ukiah and I come live with him?

25:12.878 --> 25:15.403
My mother depends on
the child-support money...

25:15.580 --> 25:17.377
...but maybe I could get kicked out.

25:17.549 --> 25:19.574
That's a lot of what-ifs.

25:19.751 --> 25:23.448
Do you think you could help me find
some job opportunities for my dad?

25:24.456 --> 25:25.946
It's possible.

25:26.124 --> 25:28.285
We can do this, Sheeni.
This can happen.

25:29.928 --> 25:32.590
Well, look at you
taking control of the situation.

25:32.764 --> 25:34.994
I'll do whatever I have to do.

25:35.400 --> 25:40.064
I've never had anything in my life
that I wanted to fight for so much.

25:40.238 --> 25:43.537
Then we'll have to figure out a way
for you to be kicked out.

25:43.708 --> 25:46.074
You have to be bad, Nicky.

25:46.244 --> 25:49.680
Be very, very bad.

25:49.848 --> 25:52.009
I have a tall mountain to climb...

25:52.183 --> 25:54.413
...with many treacherous glaciers
to cross.

25:54.586 --> 26:00.286
But finally I've obtained an entry visa
to the paradise that lays beyond.

26:00.458 --> 26:02.426
I won't let him out of my sight.

26:29.487 --> 26:31.318
Where's the Nova?

26:31.489 --> 26:34.481
See that, babe? They took it back.

26:34.659 --> 26:36.752
Sailors are all talk...

26:36.928 --> 26:38.953
...all the time.

26:43.001 --> 26:44.093
Jerry.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.328
Shit on a goddamn dick.

26:46.504 --> 26:51.407
I have spent the last 1 5 years trying
to get this house to look just perfect.

26:51.576 --> 26:55.706
Oh, God, Nick. Go get a pan quick.
It's dripping on my new shag.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.780
Yeah, I'll get a pan.

26:57.949 --> 27:00.850
You should have given that man
his money back.

27:03.221 --> 27:06.019
Holy shit. There's still water
in the windshield thing.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.952
But how'd they even get it in here?

27:09.127 --> 27:12.460
Looks like they took it apart
piece by piece and then...

27:12.631 --> 27:14.724
...reassembled it.

27:15.600 --> 27:19.127
But that would take
an army of mechanics to do that.

27:20.238 --> 27:21.728
Or a Navy.

27:21.906 --> 27:23.908
Or a Navy, baby.

27:36.554 --> 27:39.546
I told my parents about my sister
going all the way with Carlo.

27:39.724 --> 27:42.921
Now she's playing that damn
Ashlee Simpson album over and over.

27:43.094 --> 27:46.222
My life is a living hell, Nick.
It is a living hell.

27:46.398 --> 27:49.492
Damn. I think I've got something
to cheer you up, my friend.

27:49.934 --> 27:51.697
His name is Albert.

27:51.870 --> 27:54.304
I don't know why you have a dog.
You hate dogs.

27:54.472 --> 27:56.906
This is more than a dog.

27:57.075 --> 28:00.442
This is my only tangible link
to the love of my life.

28:00.612 --> 28:02.341
You met a girl?

28:02.514 --> 28:04.482
She isn't just a girl, Lefty.

28:04.649 --> 28:06.617
She's a comely angel...

28:06.785 --> 28:09.652
...sent to teach me about
all that is good in the world.

28:09.821 --> 28:12.016
Is she prettier than Millie Filbert?

28:12.457 --> 28:13.924
Lefty...

28:14.092 --> 28:16.458
...after seeing Sheeni
you would look at Millie...

28:16.628 --> 28:19.495
...and you would see
no more than a slatternly wench...

28:19.664 --> 28:23.532
...trying to muddy your perception
of what a pretty girl should be.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.034
How do I know you're not
making this girl up?

28:32.677 --> 28:35.271
Your life has really changed since
I last saw you, Nick.

28:36.347 --> 28:38.542
How are things going with Millie?

28:39.651 --> 28:42.984
I got this book,
Lovemaking for Advanced Gourmets.

28:43.154 --> 28:45.850
I'm looking up some tips
so I can really blow her mind.

28:46.024 --> 28:47.889
For instance, there's one in here.

28:48.059 --> 28:51.426
You're supposed to stick your pinkie
inside of a girl's bumhole.

28:51.596 --> 28:52.858
-Liar.
-Read it and weep.

28:53.031 --> 28:54.999
I have it marked right there.

28:57.869 --> 29:01.965
I think that Sheeni might find this
pinkie technique less than romantic.

29:02.140 --> 29:05.507
Could I borrow this? Might be one
or two things I should know.

29:05.677 --> 29:07.145
Yeah, it's fine.

29:12.984 --> 29:15.009
-Hello?
-Hi, Nicky.

29:15.186 --> 29:17.916
Have you any misdeeds to report?

29:18.089 --> 29:19.818
I'm working on it.

29:19.991 --> 29:21.515
Nicky.

29:21.693 --> 29:24.423
-You sound concerned.
-If you don't take the initiative...

29:24.596 --> 29:27.121
...how do you think you'll feel
when I marry Francois?

29:27.298 --> 29:28.492
Who's Francois?

29:28.666 --> 29:30.634
My future French husband.

29:32.437 --> 29:35.600
Well, I mean,
I can't wait for you forever.

29:37.509 --> 29:40.137
Nick, how is my darling Albert?

29:40.311 --> 29:41.539
Albert is great.

29:41.713 --> 29:44.307
We've been going on
these bonding jogs twice daily...

29:44.482 --> 29:46.643
...which he loves.
I've been enjoying them too.

29:46.818 --> 29:48.911
They've been getting me
into great shape.

29:49.087 --> 29:50.918
That's wonderful, darling.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.281
My one and only love
needs me to be bad...

29:55.527 --> 29:58.826
...to overcome the inhibitions
that compel me to be law-abiding...

29:58.997 --> 30:01.898
...polite to my elders
and excessively nice.

30:02.066 --> 30:04.534
I have decided to create
a supplementary persona...

30:04.702 --> 30:06.761
...named Francois Dillinger.

30:08.439 --> 30:09.667
Bold...

30:09.841 --> 30:11.468
...contemptuous of authority...

30:11.643 --> 30:13.975
...and irresistible to women.

30:14.546 --> 30:17.276
Francois is just the type
of aggressive sociopath...

30:17.448 --> 30:20.212
... who can wage, and win,
a war of nerves.

30:30.428 --> 30:32.988
Better give your mother a hug, son.

30:33.765 --> 30:34.959
Oh, no.

30:35.133 --> 30:38.899
It turns out Jerry had a heart attack
in a Dallas bar and took it badly.

30:39.070 --> 30:40.162
He died.

30:40.338 --> 30:43.239
When will the body arrive?

30:44.309 --> 30:46.504
I'm afraid it's already been
shipped, ma'am...

30:46.678 --> 30:47.872
...to his wife.

30:48.046 --> 30:50.139
His wife?

30:51.082 --> 30:53.175
Yes, ma'am, his wife.

30:54.853 --> 30:58.448
It's also my duty to inform you
she wishes to claim the Lincoln...

30:58.623 --> 31:01.649
...which he registered
to this address.

31:08.066 --> 31:09.397
It's okay.

31:09.567 --> 31:11.831
There, there. It's gonna be okay.

31:12.003 --> 31:14.767
There, there.
Everything will be okay.

31:28.119 --> 31:30.212
Those are my records.
What are you doing?

31:30.388 --> 31:34.188
You're not gonna get this girl by
listening to records and jerking off.

31:34.359 --> 31:36.850
Well, that wasn't my entire plan.

31:37.028 --> 31:38.393
What is your plan, shithead?

31:38.563 --> 31:41.657
Slouching your shoulders
while Trent boy has her on his lap?

31:41.833 --> 31:44.393
I don't need you here right now.
I just need to think.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.059
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

31:46.237 --> 31:48.797
Not until you sink your filthy dick
in this tomato.

31:49.407 --> 31:51.671
Not until you get what you want.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.338
Now it's time to rebel, Nick.

31:55.513 --> 31:57.378
It's time to be bad.

31:57.548 --> 32:01.177
It's not a good day for that.
My mom got some devastating news.

32:02.020 --> 32:03.715
That's perfect.

32:03.888 --> 32:05.651
She's vulnerable.

32:05.823 --> 32:07.757
She's fragile.

32:08.226 --> 32:11.218
Now, what does she value
more than anything?

32:12.530 --> 32:14.828
She values her things.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.464
With the guidance of Francois...

32:23.641 --> 32:26.838
...I quickly transformed myself
into a textbook juvenile delinquent.

32:29.347 --> 32:31.542
Sheeni has held up
her end of the bargain...

32:31.716 --> 32:35.015
...by finding Dad work at a magazine
called Progressive Plywood.

32:35.186 --> 32:37.780
She called him
pretending to be a headhunter.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.117
-Really?
-It took some convincing on her part.

32:40.291 --> 32:42.885
Sounds cool,
but I don't know much about wood.

32:43.061 --> 32:44.653
That's not what I've heard.

32:44.829 --> 32:48.162
To my chagrin, the magazine is
owned by the father of Trent Preston.

32:48.333 --> 32:51.234
-Let me go first, this is heavy.
-There were no other options.

32:51.402 --> 32:52.767
Nice house, right?

33:01.512 --> 33:03.878
Oh, thank you.

33:05.950 --> 33:07.781
Oh, thanks. Ex-squeeze me.

33:07.952 --> 33:09.010
Sit over there.

33:10.188 --> 33:13.055
-Oh, Nicky.
-Morning, everyone.

33:13.658 --> 33:16.525
Isn't it nice of Officer Westcott
to drop by so early...

33:16.694 --> 33:19.254
...and have breakfast with us?

33:19.430 --> 33:22.228
Oh, it sure was. Yeah, that's nice.

33:22.400 --> 33:25.369
Oh, your father called.
He got a job in Ukiah.

33:25.536 --> 33:27.436
That's good for him.

33:27.605 --> 33:29.072
Good.

33:31.009 --> 33:34.706
Do you think it might be a good idea
if I moved in with him for a little bit?

33:34.879 --> 33:37.143
You know as well as I do
that's not gonna work.

33:37.315 --> 33:39.545
I depend on that
child-support money to eat.

33:41.152 --> 33:44.315
Shouldn't you depend on child-support
money to support your child?

33:44.489 --> 33:48.050
Hey, be nice to your mom, kid.
She's grieving.

33:53.498 --> 33:56.262
When do I take this off?
How long do you leave it on for?

33:56.434 --> 33:59.028
Just leave it on for three minutes.

34:04.475 --> 34:05.999
Shit.

34:06.344 --> 34:09.108
Those fuckers
are taking a shower together.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.143
How repulsive.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.619
-Shit! Shit! Turn it off!
-Fuck!

34:32.670 --> 34:35.331
What was all that racket last night?

34:39.944 --> 34:42.572
Nicky, I'm sorry if we disturbed you.

34:42.746 --> 34:45.237
You know, this is my home too.

34:45.750 --> 34:49.481
All of a sudden some stranger starts
staying over, I'm not even consulted.

34:51.355 --> 34:54.051
What's with you, kid?
Just mind your own damn business.

34:54.225 --> 34:55.658
No, you mind your business.

34:55.827 --> 34:57.852
He's my son.

34:59.063 --> 35:02.999
Nicky, you're right. I should have
informed you that Officer Westcott...

35:03.167 --> 35:06.034
...was gonna be spending the evening.
I'm sorry.

35:06.204 --> 35:09.537
I thought there were laws in the city
against illicit cohabitation.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.376
Or are they just another
big policeman's joke?

35:13.544 --> 35:16.604
Kid, you're asking for trouble.
Just don't.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.112
Just don't.

35:18.549 --> 35:20.779
Or what are you gonna do?

35:20.952 --> 35:22.044
Shoot me with your gun?

35:22.487 --> 35:25.115
All right, all right. Lance.
Okay, okay, okay.

35:25.289 --> 35:28.417
You just shut your mouth right now.
Right now.

35:29.327 --> 35:31.124
Thanks for breakfast.

35:31.295 --> 35:33.456
Where are you going?

35:45.977 --> 35:47.638
What are those for?

35:48.679 --> 35:52.240
You and I are gonna find a nice quiet
parking lot and set this baby on fire.

35:52.416 --> 35:55.214
-I thought we were gonna wreck it.
-Use your head.

35:55.386 --> 35:57.752
No sense getting killed for a girl.

36:06.864 --> 36:09.924
-Sure you know what you're doing?
-Relax, kid. I read the book.

36:10.101 --> 36:12.069
Okay, pull over. Pull over.

36:12.937 --> 36:14.234
We have to pull over.

36:14.405 --> 36:16.339
Pull over now.

36:17.475 --> 36:18.772
Okay.

36:18.943 --> 36:22.674
We need to consider our actions
and what the consequences will be.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.405
Listen, asshole.

36:24.582 --> 36:28.541
You've been making all the decisions
for 1 6 years. Look at where you are.

36:28.719 --> 36:30.550
I'm here to rescue you from yourself.

36:30.721 --> 36:33.053
Just be quiet
and let me blow some shit up.

36:33.224 --> 36:36.387
Can I make one request since
it's my life that we're talking about?

36:36.561 --> 36:39.655
Can we keep it to the absolute
minimum amount of destruction?

36:39.830 --> 36:41.730
Yeah, perfect. Okay.

36:41.899 --> 36:44.424
Absolute minimum. That's good.

36:44.602 --> 36:46.194
I like that.

37:25.576 --> 37:26.838
Let's get out of here!

38:51.929 --> 38:54.090
Luckily no major injuries
were reported...

38:54.265 --> 38:57.200
...though several firefighters
were hospitalized due to....

38:58.869 --> 39:00.461
Hi, guys. How was dinner?

39:00.638 --> 39:02.401
Keep your lips sewn, fucker.

39:02.573 --> 39:05.872
You stole your mother's car and trailer
and you set a $5 million fire?

39:06.043 --> 39:08.204
I refuse to stand for
such allegations.

39:08.379 --> 39:10.609
Nicky, they have a description
of the arsonist.

39:10.781 --> 39:13.773
Right here. "White teenage male,
approximately 5'9".

39:13.951 --> 39:16.613
1 35 pounds, dirty blond hair.

39:16.787 --> 39:23.351
Last seen pulling a trailer with 'God's
Perfect Asshole' painted on the side."

39:23.527 --> 39:24.755
That could be anyone.

39:24.929 --> 39:28.296
God, my only son is going to prison.
What am I gonna do?

39:28.466 --> 39:31.526
No, no, no.

39:31.702 --> 39:33.863
It's gonna be okay.

39:34.038 --> 39:36.199
You know what? I'll tell you what.

39:36.374 --> 39:40.743
I'll just say that Nick reported the car
stolen before the fire.

39:40.911 --> 39:43.880
This way it'll get him off the hook.
Okay?

39:45.216 --> 39:48.413
But I could take
some serious, serious heat for this.

39:48.586 --> 39:50.679
Oh, Lance, you are so wonderful.

39:50.855 --> 39:53.119
What can I ever do to repay you?

39:53.758 --> 39:55.248
I'll think of something.

39:55.426 --> 39:57.758
Oh, but you know what?
You know what, baby?

39:58.262 --> 40:02.790
I don't think he should be here
when the detectives come around.

40:02.967 --> 40:04.491
Right?

40:04.668 --> 40:09.162
So the best thing to do
is to send him away for a while.

40:12.410 --> 40:15.311
Let him go make his father's life
miserable for a change.

40:15.479 --> 40:17.947
-But I like it here.
-You're gone, buster.

40:20.117 --> 40:21.141
Hello?

40:21.318 --> 40:24.344
Your son just burned down Berkeley.
Come and get the brat.

40:24.522 --> 40:26.456
-Estelle?
-Start packing your bags.

40:26.624 --> 40:29.024
Oh, no, no.

40:29.193 --> 40:31.024
Aren't you going to punish him?

40:31.195 --> 40:33.629
I'd say he deserves a good hiding.

40:33.798 --> 40:37.461
He's just too much for me anymore.
Can you do it, hon?

40:37.635 --> 40:39.830
Yeah, I could help you out.

40:46.544 --> 40:48.375
I stepped away for a few minutes.

40:48.546 --> 40:51.515
Francois volunteered
to take the thrashing.

40:51.682 --> 40:54.708
A painful sacrifice
for the woman I love.

40:55.686 --> 40:57.586
You through, big man?

41:02.059 --> 41:04.357
So off we go to beautiful Ukiah...

41:04.528 --> 41:06.519
... where soon I'll be
in the warm embrace...

41:06.697 --> 41:09.257
...of the mother
of my future gifted children.

41:19.076 --> 41:20.737
-Hello?
-Sheeni, it's Nick.

41:22.012 --> 41:23.843
Hi, darling. Where are you?

41:24.014 --> 41:26.141
I'm here. I'm in Ukiah.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.547
I'm living with my dad.
My mother kicked me out.

41:28.719 --> 41:29.913
How did you do it?

41:30.087 --> 41:32.885
I stole my mother's car
and burned down half of Berkeley.

41:33.057 --> 41:35.355
She had no choice
but to send me away.

41:35.526 --> 41:38.495
-Nicky, that's incredible.
-Well, I did it for you, Sheeni.

41:38.662 --> 41:40.789
I did it so that we could be together.

41:40.965 --> 41:43.399
I bet you didn't think I had it in me,
did you?

41:43.567 --> 41:46.092
That is so romantic, Nicky.
I don't know what to say.

41:46.270 --> 41:47.669
It'll be just like we planned.

41:47.838 --> 41:50.102
It'll be you and me and Albert,
all together.

41:51.408 --> 41:53.342
Hello, Mr. Saunders.
Is Sheeni available?

41:53.511 --> 41:55.103
She most certainly is not.

41:55.279 --> 41:57.941
We know all about what you did
in Berkeley, young man.

41:58.115 --> 42:02.347
You are lucky I don't strangle you
right here in Christ's eyes.

42:02.520 --> 42:05.011
You're the devil
and that dog is a hell beast.

42:05.189 --> 42:08.920
You're lucky we don't call the police
and have you arrested right now.

42:09.093 --> 42:10.754
You're not gonna let me
see Sheeni?

42:10.928 --> 42:11.952
Sheeni's leaving.

42:12.129 --> 42:13.756
-We're sending her away.
-What?

42:13.931 --> 42:16.229
To boarding school,
where she'll be safe.

42:16.400 --> 42:20.860
She's had a lot of bad influences
here in Ukiah, you being the worst.

42:21.038 --> 42:23.438
I'm in love with Sheeni.
I can't live without her.

42:23.607 --> 42:25.905
Live without her or die,
we have no preference.

42:26.076 --> 42:28.340
Stay out of our family's life.

42:32.182 --> 42:33.774
Later Sheeni called and told me...

42:33.951 --> 42:36.886
...she managed to turn disaster
into an opportunity for herself.

42:37.054 --> 42:38.351
She convinced her parents...

42:38.522 --> 42:41.719
... to send her to a French prep school
200 miles away in Santa Cruz.

42:41.892 --> 42:45.589
She says she's been wanting to go to
this school since she was a little girl...

42:45.763 --> 42:46.991
...and that going there...

42:47.164 --> 42:50.065
... will improve her chances
for going to school in Paris.

42:50.234 --> 42:51.394
Things are bad.

42:51.569 --> 42:54.094
How am I supposed to eat
with this hideous dog staring?

42:54.271 --> 42:55.966
He likes you, George.

42:56.140 --> 42:57.937
Well, the feeling's not mutual.

42:59.443 --> 43:00.603
Nick?

43:00.778 --> 43:04.373
You won't be getting an allowance.
Might wanna think about getting a job.

43:04.548 --> 43:06.709
-Okay.
-There's an opening at my office.

43:06.884 --> 43:08.442
Typing and filing after school.

43:08.619 --> 43:10.610
Isn't that what that boy Trent does?

43:10.788 --> 43:14.224
Trent went away to some
French-speaking prep school...

43:14.391 --> 43:16.916
...down south. Santa Cruz, I think.

43:28.272 --> 43:29.398
Hello.

43:29.573 --> 43:32.098
-You're new here, right?
-Yeah.

43:32.276 --> 43:34.608
I'm Vijay Joshi. It's nice to meet you.

43:34.778 --> 43:36.473
Nick Twisp. Pleasure to meet you.

43:42.252 --> 43:45.016
So have you made many friends
in Ukiah yet, Nick?

43:45.189 --> 43:47.282
Not really.
I moved here for my girlfriend...

43:47.458 --> 43:50.120
...and she just went to some
French school in Santa Cruz.

43:50.294 --> 43:53.695
-Sheeni Saunders?
-Yeah. Did you know her?

43:53.864 --> 43:55.195
We were locker neighbors.

43:55.366 --> 43:58.392
So you are her new fellow?

43:59.303 --> 44:00.895
I'm surprised.

44:01.071 --> 44:02.663
Why's that?

44:02.840 --> 44:05.673
It's just that to replace
the magnificent Trent Preston...

44:05.843 --> 44:08.403
...one expects at least a minor deity.

44:09.380 --> 44:12.679
It's good to know us short fellows
have appeal with the ladies.

44:12.850 --> 44:16.809
Right. I believe I'm of average height
for my age, Vijay.

44:16.987 --> 44:18.682
Do tell Sheeni I say hello.

44:18.856 --> 44:21.450
How fortunate
to attend L'Ecole des Arts.

44:21.625 --> 44:23.183
I've always wanted to go.

44:23.360 --> 44:25.692
-Do you speak French?
-Yes, fluently.

44:25.863 --> 44:28.263
She says English is forbidden
on campus.

44:28.432 --> 44:32.960
"Even if you are hemorrhaging
from an accidental limb amputation."

44:33.570 --> 44:35.697
She has a roommate from New York,
Taggarty...

44:35.873 --> 44:37.807
...who has already slept with
1 7 guys...

44:37.975 --> 44:40.341
...and hopes to rack up 50
before college.

44:41.011 --> 44:42.808
I really must meet this girl.

44:43.580 --> 44:44.604
Keep going.

44:44.782 --> 44:46.716
She says Trent has taken up
windsurfing...

44:46.884 --> 44:49.978
...and become target number one
among all the girls in her class.

44:50.154 --> 44:51.712
She's trying not to be jealous...

44:51.889 --> 44:54.221
...but sometimes experiences
twinges of distress.

44:54.391 --> 44:58.088
She also says that Trent's presence
on campus came as a shock to her...

44:58.262 --> 45:02.631
...and that it is merely a coincidence
they transferred to the same school.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.893
Yeah. Somehow I can't feature that.

45:05.069 --> 45:07.799
Trent has expressed interest in
mending the relationship...

45:07.971 --> 45:10.531
...and getting on like adults.
I think she's happy...

45:10.708 --> 45:14.144
...and looks forward to growth
in this rich intellectual environment.

45:14.311 --> 45:16.006
-I don't like the sound of this.
-No.

45:16.180 --> 45:18.410
And that roommate sounds like
a bad influence.

45:18.582 --> 45:20.880
She certainly sounds uninhibited.

45:21.051 --> 45:22.951
I wonder if she likes intelligent boys.

45:23.120 --> 45:26.886
Trent Preston is gonna mindfuck her
into thinking she's too good for me.

45:27.057 --> 45:31.187
Then he's probably going to fuck her
in more literal ways.

45:32.596 --> 45:34.154
I've gotta get down there.

45:34.331 --> 45:36.458
I could accompany you
and meet this Taggarty.

45:36.633 --> 45:39.227
Okay.
How are we gonna get down there?

45:39.403 --> 45:42.566
-We could use my grandmother's car.
-Will she let us have it?

45:42.740 --> 45:44.731
She's hooked up to
life-support equipment.

45:44.908 --> 45:46.569
Permission is not a salient issue.

45:46.744 --> 45:48.109
Vijay, that's great.

46:30.621 --> 46:33.954
Excuse me. Do you guys know
Sheeni Saunders?

46:35.959 --> 46:37.688
Very helpful.

46:41.064 --> 46:43.794
Excuse me.
Do you guys know Sheeni Saunders?

46:44.168 --> 46:45.931
Are you fucking kidding me?

46:47.371 --> 46:48.998
-Do you see her?
-I'm afraid not.

46:49.840 --> 46:51.501
Do you guys know Sheeni Saunders?

46:51.675 --> 46:54.041
Sheeni Saunders.
Do you speak English?

46:54.211 --> 46:55.769
Do you speak English?

46:55.946 --> 46:58.176
You don't speak English? Liar.

46:58.348 --> 46:59.815
Bullshit.

47:00.017 --> 47:01.041
Speak English to me.

47:01.485 --> 47:03.646
Nobody speaks English?
This is America.

47:03.821 --> 47:06.016
-You fucking kidding me?
-Nick?

47:06.990 --> 47:08.321
Sheeni.

47:08.492 --> 47:10.824
Albert.

47:11.128 --> 47:13.062
-Hello.
-Hi.

47:19.503 --> 47:23.098
I can't believe you came all this way.
And with Albert.

47:23.273 --> 47:25.571
I had to see you, Sheeni.

47:25.742 --> 47:27.334
I can't stop thinking about you.

47:27.511 --> 47:29.172
That's sweet.

47:30.180 --> 47:32.944
And Albert won't stop
talking about you.

47:33.684 --> 47:36.517
Do you find your classes
stimulating?

47:37.187 --> 47:39.121
A few of them are all right.

47:39.323 --> 47:42.292
At the moment I'm doing a historical
analysis on the Ramayana.

47:43.026 --> 47:44.789
Ah, yes.

47:47.030 --> 47:50.488
Blow, oh wind
To where my loved one is

47:51.702 --> 47:53.431
Touch him

47:53.737 --> 47:57.332
And come touch me soon

48:01.211 --> 48:04.772
You two boys shouldn't sleep in
your car tonight. It might not be safe.

48:04.948 --> 48:07.041
We could sneak you in
after lights out.

48:07.217 --> 48:09.412
-Sounds great.
-I'm in.

48:09.987 --> 48:15.152
Madame, I am suffering from
agonizing female troubles.

48:20.097 --> 48:21.564
There's your competition.

49:41.411 --> 49:44.574
You think that Trent fellow
would sleep on the floor?

49:56.226 --> 49:58.660
-Hey.
-Hey.

50:04.001 --> 50:05.730
I'm sorry, sweetie...

50:05.902 --> 50:08.302
...but not with other people
in the room.

50:14.311 --> 50:15.642
Okay.

50:21.418 --> 50:23.784
-Good night.
-Night.

50:54.885 --> 50:56.375
Who are you?

50:56.553 --> 50:59.579
I'm Sheeni's friend Nick.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

50:59.756 --> 51:02.281
It's okay. You don't have to go.

51:04.027 --> 51:07.656
So are you Sheeni's boyfriend
or something?

51:07.831 --> 51:09.492
Yeah.

51:10.100 --> 51:12.261
And you're spending the night?

51:12.436 --> 51:13.698
Where's Taggarty?

51:13.870 --> 51:16.805
Sleeping. A friend and l
are just camping out on the floor.

51:17.407 --> 51:20.103
I get it. A slumber party.

51:22.179 --> 51:23.976
I'm Bernice.

51:24.281 --> 51:26.749
Bernice Lynch. Not that you asked.

51:26.917 --> 51:29.818
Bernice Lynch,
that's a very pretty name.

51:30.554 --> 51:34.149
I think that my friend Trent Preston
might have mentioned you.

51:34.324 --> 51:38.784
Yeah, Bernice Lynch. But he said that
you were frumpy and unpresentable.

51:38.962 --> 51:41.988
Now that I've met you,
I can see that Trent is a lying bastard.

51:42.165 --> 51:45.794
I shouldn't be his friend if he goes
around calling you trashy-looking.

51:45.969 --> 51:47.459
What kind of person does that?

51:47.637 --> 51:50.105
But, you know,
he's been very sensitive and touchy...

51:50.273 --> 51:52.298
...ever since he started doing steroids.

51:52.476 --> 51:55.172
-Trent does steroids?
-He does a lot of steroids.

51:55.345 --> 51:58.109
He says it's to ensure that
he becomes the best windsurfer.

51:58.281 --> 52:01.273
He figures since he can't write poetry,
he has to plagiarize....

52:01.451 --> 52:04.386
You mean all of his poetry is stolen?

52:04.821 --> 52:08.621
Of course. It's all classic Bobby Frost.
Every word.

52:08.792 --> 52:11.693
Trent and Sheeni can go to hell.

52:38.054 --> 52:40.682
-Hey.
-Hi.

52:43.093 --> 52:45.789
Hey, it's a bit cold on the floor.

52:45.962 --> 52:47.452
Is it?

52:48.098 --> 52:51.659
Yeah. Do you think maybe I could
cuddle next to you?

52:54.704 --> 52:56.535
The whole night?

52:57.440 --> 52:58.907
Yeah.

53:01.211 --> 53:03.509
Yeah, I guess that would be okay.

53:04.381 --> 53:06.815
Or we could do more than just cuddle.

53:08.618 --> 53:09.710
Nick.

53:09.886 --> 53:12.514
I love it when you say my name.

53:12.689 --> 53:14.589
Why don't you pull down
these blankets...

53:14.758 --> 53:16.851
...and show me
what you're hiding under there?

53:17.027 --> 53:19.188
Is that what you want me to do?

53:20.096 --> 53:23.896
-Say yes.
-That is exactly what I want you to do.

53:24.067 --> 53:27.002
And then I wanna
tickle your belly button...

53:27.170 --> 53:29.161
...from the inside.

53:30.373 --> 53:32.500
Nick, you're being so bad.

53:32.676 --> 53:36.544
Not half as bad as the nasty things
I wanna do right now with my tongue.

53:38.481 --> 53:40.381
I'm gonna wrap your legs
around my head...

53:40.617 --> 53:42.949
...and wear you like the crown
that you are.

53:44.087 --> 53:46.078
If that's okay with you.

53:53.296 --> 53:55.127
My God,
what's gotten into you tonight?

53:55.298 --> 53:57.596
I don't know, but let's go with it.

54:23.426 --> 54:24.950
Nick!

54:25.829 --> 54:27.319
Nick. You have to take Albert.

54:54.024 --> 54:57.391
God, we were so close. Fuck.

54:57.560 --> 54:59.551
How was it, Vijay?

54:59.729 --> 55:00.991
It was magnificent.

55:01.164 --> 55:02.961
I fear it could be terribly addicting.

55:03.133 --> 55:06.569
This night has ignited in me
a lust of disturbing insatiability.

55:06.736 --> 55:08.033
Yeah, well, congratulations.

55:08.204 --> 55:10.638
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

55:10.807 --> 55:12.399
Fuck. Fuck.

55:13.910 --> 55:15.741
Fuck.

55:15.912 --> 55:18.210
Fuck. Fuck.

55:21.651 --> 55:23.209
Fuck.

55:27.357 --> 55:28.483
Hello?

55:28.658 --> 55:30.319
Mr. Ferguson, it's Nick.

55:30.493 --> 55:32.552
Oh, Nick boy. How are you, son?

55:32.729 --> 55:33.991
Not so good, Mr. Ferguson.

55:34.164 --> 55:36.655
I'm attempting to smuggle
a young illegal immigrant...

55:36.833 --> 55:39.802
...who's fleeing political oppression
on the subcontinent...

55:39.969 --> 55:42.130
...but we've become stranded
in our attempts...

55:42.305 --> 55:45.468
...and now we face not being able
to get to the sanctuary at all.

55:45.642 --> 55:47.439
Oh, dear, the poor lad.

55:47.610 --> 55:51.046
Yeah, it's breaking my heart.
He's got the saddest look on his face.

55:53.950 --> 55:55.440
Those poor girls.

55:55.618 --> 55:58.985
They'll likely notify their parents,
perhaps even expel them.

56:00.523 --> 56:02.218
Expel them?

56:02.792 --> 56:04.419
Oh, my God, you're right.

56:04.594 --> 56:06.391
They'll be expelled.

56:07.230 --> 56:09.960
Sheeni will have to
come back to Ukiah.

56:10.433 --> 56:13.834
Bernice, you sweet angel
of the lavatory.

56:14.471 --> 56:16.200
Come on.

56:19.642 --> 56:20.973
Mr. Ferguson.

56:23.113 --> 56:24.603
Good heavens.

56:24.781 --> 56:27.614
You boys must be freezing.

56:28.451 --> 56:31.181
And this must be the little soldier.

56:35.358 --> 56:36.757
Welcome.

56:38.194 --> 56:39.957
What's happened to your clothes,
son?

56:43.833 --> 56:45.960
INS took them.

56:46.136 --> 56:47.501
Damn them.

56:47.670 --> 56:51.697
When I was arriving by the customs,
sir. It was so terrible.

56:51.875 --> 56:54.901
They told me I was even lucky
to keep my knickers.

56:56.513 --> 56:58.413
Well, that nightmare is over.

56:59.983 --> 57:03.111
And why don't you have
any clothes on, Nick?

57:05.155 --> 57:07.123
Solidarity.

57:10.860 --> 57:13.328
Thanks for getting us, Mr. Ferguson.

57:14.597 --> 57:16.588
So this safe house is in Ukiah?

57:16.766 --> 57:17.994
That's right.

57:18.168 --> 57:20.033
You're certain
they'll take care of him?

57:20.203 --> 57:23.229
Oh, yeah. They'll treat him
as if he were their own.

57:28.244 --> 57:32.078
After we dropped Vijay off, I asked
Mr. Ferguson to spend the night.

57:32.248 --> 57:34.341
It would give Dad
a chance to reciprocate...

57:34.517 --> 57:37.213
...for all the nights he spent on
Mr. Ferguson's couch...

57:37.387 --> 57:40.413
...before he and Mom
finally tossed in the towel.

57:40.590 --> 57:44.026
Mr. Ferguson agreed not to tell Dad
about the refugee.

57:44.194 --> 57:47.322
He understands that sometimes
you have to lie for a greater cause.

57:47.497 --> 57:50.466
You know what, you are a tight-assed,
critical, sexist drunk.

57:50.633 --> 57:53.534
Hey, honey, it doesn't bother me
if you wanna sleep alone.

57:53.703 --> 57:56.797
Well, does it bother you
that you're a boring selfish lover?

57:59.576 --> 58:02.807
I ran into Mr. Ferguson downtown.
Is it okay if he spends the night?

58:02.979 --> 58:05.243
What the hell are you doing
in your underwear?

58:10.687 --> 58:12.314
Hi, Nick.

58:17.026 --> 58:18.459
Want a hit?

58:18.962 --> 58:20.862
Sorry, do I know you?

58:21.898 --> 58:25.163
I'm Paul. Sheeni's older brother.

58:26.603 --> 58:28.298
Come on in.

58:47.357 --> 58:50.554
-How'd you know it was me, Paul?
-We've met.

58:51.294 --> 58:52.852
No we haven't.

58:53.630 --> 58:54.961
In a previous life.

58:59.235 --> 59:00.998
Nice fire.

59:02.972 --> 59:04.963
Did Sheeni tell you that was me?

59:05.141 --> 59:06.870
She didn't have to.

59:07.477 --> 59:10.139
Why?
Was I an arsonist in a previous life?

59:10.313 --> 59:11.712
No...

59:11.881 --> 59:13.872
...but Sheeni was.

59:27.096 --> 59:28.791
That's very good.

59:29.832 --> 59:32.130
I spoke with Taggarty on the phone
this morning.

59:32.302 --> 59:35.135
She requested I send a wallet-sized
photograph for her wall.

59:35.572 --> 59:37.699
-So did they get expelled?
-No.

59:37.874 --> 59:40.809
Taggarty was able to convince
the matron it was innocent.

59:40.977 --> 59:42.808
Innocent? Are you kidding me?

59:42.979 --> 59:46.244
I could have cut the sexual intercourse
in that room with a knife.

59:49.586 --> 59:52.020
Francois feels that a man
can only take so much...

59:52.188 --> 59:54.349
...before his dignity demands
he rise up...

59:54.524 --> 59:57.186
...against an absurd
and unjust universe.

59:57.360 --> 59:59.954
I'm going to need a partner in crime.

01:00:00.463 --> 01:00:01.862
"Dear Bernice...

01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:04.397
...it was nice meeting you
in the bathroom.

01:00:04.567 --> 01:00:06.501
I hope your stomach has settled.

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:09.103
I know you informed the matron
of our presence...

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:11.467
...but I want you to know
I hold no grudge.

01:00:11.641 --> 01:00:14.508
You were still upset from hearing
all the horrible things...

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:18.340
... Trent has been saying about you
and probably weren't yourself.

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:20.709
I think Trent needs to be
taught a lesson...

01:00:20.883 --> 01:00:23.909
...for calling you a fat cow
and an ugly whore.

01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:27.614
I suggest you take revenge by
getting Sheeni kicked out of school.

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:31.157
Everyone knows it would crush Trent
if she were sent away.

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:34.296
How to get her kicked out of school,
you may ask?

01:00:34.564 --> 01:00:37.727
I have included a number of
sleeping pills with this note.

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:41.802
You must introduce one into her
breakfast beverage each morning.

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:45.737
She may be intelligent and beautiful,
but is not likely to pass her courses...

01:00:45.908 --> 01:00:48.570
...if she is falling asleep in class.

01:00:48.745 --> 01:00:51.441
Since meeting you,
I realize my interest in Sheeni...

01:00:51.614 --> 01:00:54.174
... was merely
an adolescent infatuation.

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:57.183
You seem like a much more
genuine person.

01:00:57.353 --> 01:00:59.947
Do you suppose there is any truth
to the rumors...

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:03.320
... that Trent lost his virginity
to his first cousin?

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:07.122
Perhaps you should ask around
and see if anyone else heard that.

01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:10.697
Be strong, Bernice. Take courage.

01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:14.437
Affectionately yours, Nick Twisp. "

01:01:24.247 --> 01:01:25.339
Hi, folks.

01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:27.239
Hi, Nick.

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:31.717
I didn't realize
you two knew each other.

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:34.755
We met the other day
and got to talking...

01:01:34.924 --> 01:01:36.858
...and realized we both know you.

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:39.961
Isn't life funny?
Paul, don't you think?

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:43.125
Only slightly.

01:01:43.299 --> 01:01:45.563
We saved you some mushrooms,
Nick.

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:47.600
It's gonna change your life.

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:50.500
Yeah, they're pretty powerful,
so only take two.

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:35.043
Have fun.

01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:05.072
Lacey.

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.506
What in fuck are you people doing?

01:04:08.277 --> 01:04:11.007
Nick, what the fuck is going on?

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:14.274
Okay, George. Just calm down now.

01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:15.940
Who the--? What--?

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:18.609
Calm down before the neighbors
call the sheriff.

01:04:21.257 --> 01:04:22.747
Okay, Lacey, come on.

01:04:26.729 --> 01:04:28.594
Okay. You can get up? Yeah.

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:30.925
Get your hands off me,
you fuck.

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:34.365
-Easy, George.
-Fuck.

01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:36.298
Fuck.

01:04:36.472 --> 01:04:38.565
I apologize.

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:46.940
Bye, guys.

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:50.352
Bye, Nicky.

01:04:50.953 --> 01:04:53.615
You know, Sheeni's coming home
for Thanksgiving dinner.

01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:55.620
You should be there.

01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:57.725
But, Paul, your parents despise me.

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:01.528
Dinner's at 2. Hope you like turkey.

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:02.959
I love it.

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:18.276
-Hello?
-Nick.

01:05:18.447 --> 01:05:20.244
-Hi, Mom. What's up?
-How are you?

01:05:20.416 --> 01:05:21.610
I'm fine, Mom.

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:23.843
Lance and I are through.

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:25.851
He was being very rude to me.

01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:28.422
And at my age,
I don't have to stand for that.

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:29.990
That's good to hear, Mom.

01:05:30.159 --> 01:05:32.525
Maybe you should
try and be single for a while.

01:05:32.695 --> 01:05:34.993
Romances don't seem to be
your calling in life.

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:37.824
Listen, Nicky,
when Lance stormed out...

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.161
...he said he was through
covering for you.

01:05:40.336 --> 01:05:42.896
The Berkeley police
know that you set that fire...

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:44.869
...and Lance told them
where you are.

01:05:45.975 --> 01:05:48.205
Nicky, they're coming to arrest you.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.749
Okay, Mom. Thanks for calling.
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:06:00.756 --> 01:06:04.089
You're still going over there?
We need to get out town.

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.285
What about Sheeni?

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:07.520
Think.

01:06:07.697 --> 01:06:10.689
Is this bitch worth going to jail for?

01:06:32.355 --> 01:06:33.447
-Oh, hi, Nick.
-Hi, Paul.

01:06:33.622 --> 01:06:35.180
Right on time. Come on in.

01:06:35.358 --> 01:06:37.258
I brought some maple bars
for dessert.

01:06:37.426 --> 01:06:39.018
-Fantastic.
-They're really good.

01:06:39.195 --> 01:06:41.493
-They smell good.
-Hello.

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:44.633
-Happy Thanksgiving, Nicky.
-Oh, hey, Lacey.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.131
I brought some maple bars.

01:06:46.302 --> 01:06:47.894
Oh, thank you. I'll set them out.

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:51.597
Mr. and Mrs. Saunders,
you remember Nick, don't you?

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:56.143
Hi.

01:06:59.582 --> 01:07:02.551
Paul served them
an appetizer earlier.

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:04.810
Stuffed mushrooms.

01:07:11.961 --> 01:07:13.258
Hey.

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:15.929
Nick.

01:07:16.098 --> 01:07:17.588
Sheeni.

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:22.000
What's wrong? What's wrong?

01:07:22.171 --> 01:07:23.638
What?

01:07:25.374 --> 01:07:27.638
I was expelled.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:32.139
What? Why?

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:35.744
For falling asleep in class.

01:07:35.918 --> 01:07:37.783
For my grades.

01:07:37.953 --> 01:07:42.049
I'm stuck back here with my parents
in this horrible trailer.

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:45.523
My brother's lost his mind.
He's drugged everyone.

01:07:47.797 --> 01:07:50.732
-Let's get out of here.
-What?

01:07:51.934 --> 01:07:54.061
Let's run away together.

01:07:55.171 --> 01:07:58.766
The police are after me.
They know that I started the fire.

01:07:58.941 --> 01:08:02.342
But we could be outlaws together,
just like we planned.

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:09.242
-I have to think.
-Sheeni. Dinner's ready.

01:08:15.691 --> 01:08:18.421
-Everything's delicious.
-Paul prepared the entire meal.

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:23.658
He just loves all the traditional
Thanksgiving foods.

01:08:30.805 --> 01:08:34.298
Well, I hope it's the first of many
such occasions for myself.

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:41.216
-I'll get it.
-ls someone here?

01:08:46.154 --> 01:08:47.952
-Trent.
-Happy Thanksgiving, sweetie.

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:50.115
-What are you doing here?
-Can I come in?

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:51.691
Of course.

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:54.857
Hello, everyone.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.961
Trent, this is Lacey, Paul's friend.

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:03.264
Yes, we've met before
at my father's office.

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:05.372
-Yes.
-You're looking wonderful, Lacey.

01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:07.532
Oh, thank you.

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:09.109
-Happy Thanksgiving.
-You too.

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:11.041
It's great to see you.

01:09:11.212 --> 01:09:12.874
And this is Nick.

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:16.216
Hello, Nick.

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:17.943
Hello, Trent.

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.553
Have a seat, Trent.

01:09:19.721 --> 01:09:21.917
I'm sorry, Sheeni, but I can't.

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:24.024
In fact, I have a bit of bad news.

01:09:24.193 --> 01:09:25.353
What is it?

01:09:25.528 --> 01:09:29.760
I searched the room of Bernice Lynch
thoroughly from top to bottom.

01:09:30.698 --> 01:09:33.532
Did you obtain proper authorization
from school officials?

01:09:33.702 --> 01:09:36.603
No, Nick.
I acted on my own initiative.

01:09:36.772 --> 01:09:39.899
I was curious as to why
a girl as sweet as Bernice...

01:09:40.075 --> 01:09:42.407
...would color me
in such an unflattering light.

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:45.011
In Bernice's closet, I found...

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.046
...this letter.

01:09:50.618 --> 01:09:54.282
In the letter, the writer expresses
a strong affection for Bernice...

01:09:54.456 --> 01:09:57.516
...and instructs her to begin a program
of sedating Sheeni...

01:09:57.693 --> 01:10:00.787
...with drugs that he himself
supplied.

01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:04.091
Nicky, you didn't.
You could have killed me.

01:10:04.266 --> 01:10:06.598
-Oh, Nicky.
-Bad break, Nick.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.694
-Who died?
-No one yet, Mrs. Saunders.

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:12.636
-Arrest him.
-I can't arrest him.

01:10:12.808 --> 01:10:16.608
I have called the Santa Cruz police.
They're on their way here right now.

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:20.408
Well, I'll be leaving.

01:10:21.083 --> 01:10:22.675
Please continue without me.

01:10:28.924 --> 01:10:30.585
Nick.

01:10:30.759 --> 01:10:32.590
I would advise you to remain here...

01:10:32.761 --> 01:10:36.026
...and face the consequences
of your actions like a man.

01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:40.699
Well, thank you
for that unsolicited counsel, Trent.

01:10:41.036 --> 01:10:43.061
And please do drop dead.

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:49.843
Goodbye, Sheeni.

01:12:37.052 --> 01:12:40.510
I need your help. We need to hurry.
We need to get out of here, okay?

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:43.590
-We need to leave.
-Nick, where the hell have you been?

01:12:43.759 --> 01:12:45.522
The cops were looking for you.

01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:47.958
They barged in,
found my illegal satellite dish--

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:51.531
We need to go right now.
I need you to put me up in a motel.

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.463
Are you fucking crazy?

01:12:53.635 --> 01:12:56.069
Do you expect me to let you
get away with all this?

01:12:56.238 --> 01:12:57.967
That's it. I'm calling the cops.

01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:00.631
Dad, you're gonna send
your only son to prison?

01:13:00.809 --> 01:13:04.245
Hey, I don't need a lecture
from a fucking arsonist.

01:13:04.413 --> 01:13:06.813
At least give me your car
so I can get out of here.

01:13:06.982 --> 01:13:10.315
If you think I'm gonna give you my car
you got another thing coming.

01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:13.949
Dad!

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:16.455
You're not a little kid anymore.

01:13:17.259 --> 01:13:19.250
You gotta face the music, Nick.

01:13:19.428 --> 01:13:20.895
Dad.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.273
Nick.

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:37.507
Open this door, Nick.

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:40.239
I'm warning you, don't you do this.

01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:43.283
Nick.

01:13:43.519 --> 01:13:46.488
Open this door. You open this--

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:49.516
Nick, get back here.

01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:51.852
You stop this car right now,
I'm warning you.

01:13:52.027 --> 01:13:54.996
You're in trouble!

01:14:18.987 --> 01:14:21.114
We stopping to admire the scenery
or something?

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:24.225
-I don't want to leave without Sheeni.
-Cut the shit.

01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:27.021
I can live as a woman.
I can change my name to Carlotta.

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:28.959
Why don't you start the fucking car?

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:32.828
I can't leave with her hating me.
I have to go back.

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:35.435
I have to tell her that everything I did
was for her.

01:14:35.604 --> 01:14:37.504
Let me paint you
a little picture, Nick.

01:14:37.673 --> 01:14:41.006
You go back, they bust you,
you go to jail.

01:14:41.176 --> 01:14:43.667
Sheeni goes on with her life.

01:14:43.846 --> 01:14:45.473
Fuck Sheeni.

01:15:00.262 --> 01:15:01.320
All right.

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:04.125
I'm gonna help you
get back to your lady.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.927
But you better get laid this time.

01:15:07.102 --> 01:15:10.868
If you end up going to jail a virgin,
I won't be sticking around.

01:15:11.039 --> 01:15:13.837
Now give me 25 cents, Carlotta.

01:15:27.956 --> 01:15:31.084
-Officer Lance Westcott, please.
-One moment.

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:34.091
Officer Westcott.

01:15:34.263 --> 01:15:35.821
Hey, asshole, it's me.

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:39.627
Nick. You little shit.
You know you're going to jail, right?

01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:41.928
I'm calling to make it easy for you.

01:15:42.104 --> 01:15:44.470
Hazel Park, one hour.
Round up your friends.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:47.200
I'm turning myself in. Fuck you.

01:15:48.844 --> 01:15:51.142
Holy shit, you've lost your mind.

01:15:54.616 --> 01:15:55.878
Wait.

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:11.709
--patience is beginning to wear thin
and they understand why.

01:18:11.887 --> 01:18:12.911
Terrence?

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:15.682
The measure goes before
the full state legislature...

01:18:15.857 --> 01:18:17.620
...at the end of the current session.

01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:19.124
Repeating our top story...

01:18:19.294 --> 01:18:23.253
...a police source has identified
Nicholas Twisp as a suspect...

01:18:23.432 --> 01:18:26.526
...in last September's massive fire
in downtown Berkeley.

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:31.303
We have an exclusive interview with
one of Twisp's former classmates.

01:18:31.473 --> 01:18:34.408
I just hope that society
isn't too severe in judging Nicholas.

01:18:34.576 --> 01:18:39.479
So often my generation is portrayed
as a juvenile and wasteful group.

01:18:39.648 --> 01:18:41.206
He needs help.

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:43.783
And he's better off
in the hands of the authorities.

01:18:43.952 --> 01:18:46.284
Twisp is 5'9", 1 35 pounds...

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:49.185
... with brown eyes, dirty-blond hair
and a pale complexion.

01:18:49.357 --> 01:18:51.382
He was last seen
in the vicinity of Ukiah.

01:18:52.828 --> 01:18:54.159
Who's that?

01:18:56.498 --> 01:18:59.899
Hello, Mrs. Saunders. I'm Carlotta,
Sheeni's friend from school.

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:01.626
Oh, hello there.

01:19:01.803 --> 01:19:05.500
I've come to memorize church hymns
with Sheeni for this Sunday's services.

01:19:05.674 --> 01:19:07.642
Sheeni's coming to church?

01:19:07.809 --> 01:19:09.800
That's my understanding, yeah.

01:19:09.978 --> 01:19:12.606
Oh, well, please do come in.

01:19:12.781 --> 01:19:15.306
Thank you. Thank you.

01:19:15.484 --> 01:19:16.508
Sheeni?

01:19:17.519 --> 01:19:19.919
Your friend Carlotta's here.

01:19:20.088 --> 01:19:21.146
Phil, this is Carlotta.

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:25.416
She says that Sheeni's
coming to church with her on Sunday.

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:27.255
Well, nice to meet you, young lady.

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:29.863
Nice to meet you, Mr. Saunders.

01:19:31.466 --> 01:19:33.161
Hello, Sheeni.

01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:36.102
Hello, Carlotta.

01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:39.902
May I come up?

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:49.616
You got me expelled.

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:51.480
I'm sorry, Sheeni.

01:19:51.653 --> 01:19:54.486
Do you realize what life is like
for me here?

01:19:54.656 --> 01:19:56.351
Do you have any idea?

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:59.358
Sheeni, I've been alone
my whole life.

01:19:59.561 --> 01:20:01.529
I do know what it's like.

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:06.991
I burned down Berkeley for you.

01:20:07.836 --> 01:20:09.963
I destroyed both of my parents' cars.

01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:15.941
I've lied and manipulated
and had you sedated.

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:18.375
I did all that so that...

01:20:18.547 --> 01:20:20.981
...we wouldn't have to be
alone anymore.

01:20:30.392 --> 01:20:32.417
You're him, aren't you?

01:20:32.594 --> 01:20:33.856
I'm him?

01:20:34.029 --> 01:20:36.020
You're my Francois.

01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:39.361
You're the one I've been looking for.

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:46.836
Sheeni...

01:20:47.008 --> 01:20:49.135
...I want what you want.

01:20:49.311 --> 01:20:52.576
I wanna live all over the world
and have adventures.

01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:56.781
But I'm not Francois.

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:02.112
I'm the guy who saw you
and fell in love with you...

01:21:02.290 --> 01:21:04.520
...and would do anything for you.

01:21:05.393 --> 01:21:07.224
That's who I am.

01:21:31.353 --> 01:21:32.843
I don't wanna give you this...

01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:35.751
...but I don't have anything else
to discard.

01:21:41.263 --> 01:21:43.424
Thank you very much
and here's your change.

01:21:43.598 --> 01:21:46.999
Always shop at....

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:33.374
It's a wonder that humankind has
constructed any kind of civilization...

01:22:33.548 --> 01:22:36.642
...with this monumental distraction
at hand.

01:22:43.191 --> 01:22:44.715
Trent.

01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:47.794
-What are you doing here?
-I brought the police.

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:51.797
I wasn't fooled for one second
when I saw that ugly girl walking up.

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:55.130
-You were lurking outside my house?
-Of course.

01:22:55.303 --> 01:22:56.998
Protecting you.

01:22:57.605 --> 01:22:59.937
Trent, you're a very nice person...

01:23:00.108 --> 01:23:02.736
...but I just don't have
those feelings for you.

01:23:04.079 --> 01:23:06.673
-You're going to jail.
-I don't wanna hurt you.

01:23:07.115 --> 01:23:10.915
I'll only ask once that you and your
adorable sweater step away from the--

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:17.191
-Son of a bitch.
-Let go of me.

01:23:17.359 --> 01:23:20.351
-Come here, you little shit.
-Get off, you son of a bitch.

01:23:20.528 --> 01:23:22.826
-Get off of me.
-Son of a bitch.

01:23:22.998 --> 01:23:25.296
This is the arsonist.

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:27.560
All right.

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:30.433
Just relax.

01:23:30.605 --> 01:23:32.573
It's over.

01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:35.039
I might be away for a long time,
darling.

01:23:35.210 --> 01:23:37.678
You're 1 6.
You're going to juvenile detention.

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:40.838
-You'll be out in three months.
-So you'll wait for me?

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:45.479
Where the hell else am I gonna go?

01:24:12.781 --> 01:24:15.409
Well, I'm headed for a stint
in juvenile detention.

01:24:15.583 --> 01:24:20.145
I can at least feel comforted by
the fact that I'm not going in a virgin.

01:24:20.321 --> 01:24:21.481
And at lunchtime...

01:24:21.656 --> 01:24:25.285
... when hardened offenders gather
to swap tales of teenage rebellion...

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:27.792
...I bet they'll find mine hard to top.

01:24:33.435 --> 01:24:35.335
Sheeni says she'll wait for me...

01:24:35.503 --> 01:24:38.802
...and that when I'm released,
we'll finally be together and free.

01:24:38.973 --> 01:24:41.271
And I believe her.

01:24:44.145 --> 01:24:47.603
I can feel in my heart that Sheeni
is in love with me.

01:24:47.782 --> 01:24:50.717
Not with some fantasy lover
in a French romantic novel...

01:24:50.885 --> 01:24:52.216
...but with me...

01:24:52.387 --> 01:24:53.820
...Nick Twisp.

01:24:54.856 --> 01:24:56.346
It's funny.

01:24:56.524 --> 01:24:57.923
After all that...

01:24:58.626 --> 01:25:00.958
...Nick Twisp was enough.
