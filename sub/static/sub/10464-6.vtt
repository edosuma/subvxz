WEBVTT

00:04.713 --> 00:06.764
How would you describe that?

00:08.048 --> 00:09.652
Really, really...

00:09.676 --> 00:10.935
Be honest.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.439
Adequate.

00:15.473 --> 00:17.326
- Adequate.
- Adequate's good, though.

00:17.350 --> 00:20.194
Adequate gets the job done.
Adequate's right up there.

00:21.604 --> 00:23.207
- Who could that be?
- It's probably the paperboy.

00:23.231 --> 00:24.782
No, no, no. Come back here.

00:25.066 --> 00:26.743
Bay'll get it.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.047
We've never gone 11 days before.

00:30.071 --> 00:32.749
Yeah, well, we've been busy.
We've been stressed.

00:33.199 --> 00:35.251
I'm never that stressed.

00:36.411 --> 00:41.090
Okay. I'm gonna make up for
a little lost time here.

00:41.499 --> 00:42.768
Try to get that

00:42.792 --> 00:44.886
pleasure barometer
back up over adequate.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.929
Kirsten, could you
come down here?

00:47.839 --> 00:49.390
In a minute!

00:49.591 --> 00:51.902
In a minute. You
know, I'm not 16.

00:51.926 --> 00:53.154
Come on, Charlie. Bailey's...

00:53.178 --> 00:55.980
Bailey can wait. Okay?

00:57.223 --> 00:58.993
Doesn't this worry you?

00:59.017 --> 01:00.494
The fact that we, like...
Lately, we...

01:00.518 --> 01:04.322
God, we recycle more
often than we make love.

01:04.480 --> 01:05.791
That's not true.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.251
Kirsten!

01:07.275 --> 01:08.252
Oh, Charlie...

01:08.276 --> 01:09.295
Kirsten.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.496
Bailey, I'm coming.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.249
God, Bailey, what is it?

01:18.536 --> 01:20.963
Mom? Dad?

You couldn't have,
like, I don't know,

02:01.579 --> 02:03.099
like, maybe called.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.017
If we had,

02:05.041 --> 02:07.019
you would've pretended you
weren't still mad at us

02:07.043 --> 02:08.312
and told us not to come.

02:08.336 --> 02:11.023
And after that dreadful
wedding gown debacle.

02:11.047 --> 02:12.441
I don't know if Kirs told you,

02:12.465 --> 02:15.101
but she and I had a little
to-do about the dress.

02:15.385 --> 02:16.936
Nope. Didn't say a word.

02:17.011 --> 02:19.365
Not a word. Really.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.534
We just wanted to make sure
that's all water under the bridge

02:21.558 --> 02:24.537
so that when you walk down the
aisle on your wedding day,

02:24.561 --> 02:26.372
you are not still angry
at me for insisting

02:26.396 --> 02:27.706
that only a very
small percentage

02:27.730 --> 02:30.292
of the female population
can carry off flounce.

02:30.316 --> 02:33.212
- Decaf?
- Actually, no.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.163
Oh, Gene, Gene! It's not decaf.

02:37.198 --> 02:40.094
So Ellie, Gene, what's the plan?

02:40.118 --> 02:41.637
You guys gonna stay for a while?

02:41.661 --> 02:43.013
Or just the weekend?

02:43.037 --> 02:44.849
Well, we're certainly
not gonna expect you

02:44.873 --> 02:46.684
to drop everything
to entertain us.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.019
In fact, if we could
grab a few hours,

02:49.043 --> 02:51.470
I was kind of hoping to
take your mother up to Napa

02:51.504 --> 02:52.857
on one of those
wine-tasting tours.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.483
Gene,

02:54.507 --> 02:57.653
we talked on the plane
about the wine-tasting.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.947
The whole point of coming here
was to spend time with you.

02:59.971 --> 03:03.065
Now, I wanna hear every single
detail about the wedding.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.869
We could rent clubs,
play a little golf.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.152
Sure.

03:06.352 --> 03:08.946
And we're staying in a hotel.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.534
Really. We insist.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.383
Did you remember to bring the shoes
we're gonna wear to the wedding,

03:19.407 --> 03:20.467
so she can do our hems?

03:20.491 --> 03:21.709
Got 'em.

03:24.662 --> 03:27.892
- Hey.
- What's he doing here?

03:27.916 --> 03:29.393
He's gonna drive us.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.395
I thought you said we
were gonna take the bus.

03:31.419 --> 03:33.439
Yeah, well, the bus
takes forever,

03:33.463 --> 03:35.056
and Griffin's got a car, so...

03:35.215 --> 03:37.308
I thought he had a motorcycle.

03:37.634 --> 03:38.819
So what did you do?

03:38.843 --> 03:39.862
Steal this?

03:39.886 --> 03:42.281
- Claudia!
- No.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.398
Actually, this is my dad's car.

03:44.807 --> 03:46.660
You said it was just
gonna be the two of us.

03:46.684 --> 03:49.737
Oh, for crying out loud, Claud.
He's just trying to be nice.

03:49.854 --> 03:52.249
Now, listen, the dressmaker is
expecting us in 20 minutes.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.584
So just get in the car.

03:53.608 --> 03:56.285
- No! -I said, get in
the car, Claudia!

04:02.909 --> 04:04.585
I'm sorry about that.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.005
It's all right.

04:09.749 --> 04:12.686
Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.

04:12.710 --> 04:13.646
Shut up, Will.

04:13.670 --> 04:14.897
Listen, Bay, Claud's
being a real pain.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.889
And someone's gotta take
her to the dressmaker.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.642
Oh, my God. You got
your SAT scores.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.110
Well?

04:29.811 --> 04:31.038
Nine hundred.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.905
- Yes.
- Five bucks. Come on.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.124
Nine hundred flat?

04:34.148 --> 04:35.658
It's 900 flat?

04:36.234 --> 04:37.410
Yeah.

04:37.485 --> 04:38.963
- Damn!
- Eat my dust, McCorkle.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.131
- Fork it over.
- I was positive you'd get 950.

04:41.155 --> 04:43.457
- What are you doing? - Check
the verbal for me, will you?

04:45.201 --> 04:46.553
Four forty-five.

04:46.577 --> 04:47.596
- Oh...
- Yes!

04:47.620 --> 04:49.515
- I can't believe you...
- Come on!

04:49.539 --> 04:51.299
You bet on how bad I would do?

04:51.416 --> 04:53.175
Yeah.

04:56.671 --> 04:57.940
Wow.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.024
It's no big deal, Bay.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.110
All you need to get into S.F.
is to sign your name.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.361
You have a 500-point cushion.

05:02.385 --> 05:05.155
You're scholarship
material at S.F.

05:05.179 --> 05:08.357
You're lucky you don't have to
sweat any of this college stuff.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.279
Right.

05:18.651 --> 05:19.712
Do you mind?

05:19.736 --> 05:22.798
I have to watch a documentary
on our vanishing wilderness,

05:22.822 --> 05:24.842
and it starts in two minutes.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.792
So can you please...?

05:26.868 --> 05:28.137
What's going on?

05:28.161 --> 05:29.638
He's interrupting.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.422
Homework.

05:31.622 --> 05:32.808
Well, why don't we
watch it together.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.101
Yeah, right.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.844
- Claudia!
- I'll watch upstairs.

05:39.088 --> 05:40.065
Hey.

05:40.089 --> 05:41.599
Hey!

05:42.091 --> 05:44.518
I got you something.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.523
It's a bracelet.

05:49.891 --> 05:52.443
Well, it's a weird piece
of metal I found.

05:52.643 --> 05:55.613
And I don't know, I thought you
would, think it was kind of cool.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.080
I don't wear bracelets.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.759
- Thanks.
- Claudia!

06:06.783 --> 06:08.010
- Oh, forget it.
- I will not.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.845
Claudia, get back here!

06:09.869 --> 06:11.138
Let go of me!

06:11.162 --> 06:12.639
What is your problem?

06:12.663 --> 06:15.216
He's trying to be nice to you.
Why can't you be nice to him?

06:15.333 --> 06:16.759
'Cause I don't like him.

06:17.126 --> 06:18.395
I like Justin.

06:18.419 --> 06:21.231
And it's my house, so... I can
be nice to whoever I want.

06:21.255 --> 06:23.233
I am sick of you
being like this.

06:23.257 --> 06:25.069
No one asked if you liked
Griffin or Justin.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.820
It's none of your business
who I go out with.

06:26.844 --> 06:28.145
Fine.

06:28.387 --> 06:30.532
Claudia, you think
you're grown up.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.159
You think you're smarter
than everyone else.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.118
But you're not.

06:33.142 --> 06:34.119
You're a brat. You know that?

06:34.143 --> 06:35.444
You're a 12-year-old brat.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.584
It's no bother at all.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.836
- Right, Charlie?
- No. No bother at all.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.588
- Right, Jule?
- None at all.

06:44.612 --> 06:45.923
I love sleeping on the sofa.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.925
Listen, we're so
sorry about today.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.635
But you know how
impossible it is

06:49.659 --> 06:51.303
to agree on one thing to do.

06:51.327 --> 06:54.181
Mother, please. Charlie and I
see each other all the time.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.100
Anyway, it was fun splitting up

06:56.124 --> 06:58.759
and each taking one of you.
Right, Charlie?

06:59.127 --> 07:00.469
Fun.

07:04.340 --> 07:05.484
Oh, dear.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.611
- What?
- Nothing.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.812
I just didn't even think to ask.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.824
What's wrong?

07:11.848 --> 07:15.067
It's just that, there's
only one of them.

07:15.643 --> 07:16.944
One bed?

07:17.854 --> 07:19.206
You guys sleep in...?

07:19.230 --> 07:20.531
You knew that.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.752
Oh, well, it's the only way

07:23.776 --> 07:25.254
either one of us
can get any sleep.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.381
I mean, your father just rolls
around like he's on the deck

07:27.405 --> 07:28.748
of the Titanic.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.916
Your mother's a very
polite sleeper.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.303
I guess one of you

07:33.327 --> 07:34.263
could stay in Jule's room.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.973
Nonsense. Nonsense.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.641
We just won't make a fuss, Gene.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.967
- This is fine.
- Fine.

07:43.337 --> 07:44.356
Separate beds.

07:44.380 --> 07:46.150
My parents sleep
in separate beds.

07:46.174 --> 07:48.893
It's like some crummy
sitcom from the '50s.

07:53.723 --> 07:56.869
God, do you think they don't,
you know, do it anymore?

07:56.893 --> 07:59.746
They must. No one just
stops doing it altogether.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.665
I mean, they must still
do it sometimes,

08:01.689 --> 08:03.491
don't you think, Charlie?

08:04.609 --> 08:08.287
I'm trying very hard
not to think about it.

08:11.949 --> 08:13.844
Charlie, stop.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.512
I'm way too hot.

08:15.536 --> 08:17.463
That's kind of the point.

08:18.456 --> 08:21.143
Charlie can you turn
around, please?

08:21.167 --> 08:23.093
You're breathing down my neck.

08:24.670 --> 08:25.971
Yeah.

08:29.383 --> 08:30.569
Separate beds.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.561
Can you believe it?

08:33.386 --> 08:34.855
Starting to.

08:40.852 --> 08:42.289
Now, how about this one?

08:42.313 --> 08:44.374
Wang Ping's on Grant.

08:44.398 --> 08:47.294
"Scallion pancakes to
die for." Five stars.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.546
Oh, no, the dim sum's
on Saturday only.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.006
Now that won't work.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.674
Because Saturday, I thought
we'd go to Sausalito,

08:52.698 --> 08:54.635
maybe drive to Mill
Valley, do some shopping.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.429
Then there's this restaurant
I read about in Sonoma.

08:57.453 --> 09:00.474
Which means, if we're
gonna do Chinese,

09:00.498 --> 09:02.508
today is the day.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.762
Aren't you coming?

09:07.296 --> 09:09.139
No, you guys go ahead.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.235
Why don't we just find
some great local joint

09:11.259 --> 09:12.861
that isn't overrun
with tourists.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.530
Sounds good to me.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.366
Hey, remind me to send you
all our Mexico guidebooks

09:17.390 --> 09:19.159
before you take your honeymoon.

09:19.183 --> 09:22.820
Ellen's got a whole shelf.
All the good places circled.

09:23.312 --> 09:26.323
I kind of wish we were going
someplace a little further away.

09:26.524 --> 09:29.076
We really wanna go
to Europe one day.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.129
Maybe when Owen's
a little older.

09:31.153 --> 09:34.675
Don't just talk about it. You
gotta set a date, Charlie.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.625
Even if it's years away.

09:36.993 --> 09:39.003
Otherwise, I don't
know, it just...

09:39.120 --> 09:41.088
kind of gets away from you.

09:42.164 --> 09:44.133
March, '96.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.176
That's my date.

09:48.337 --> 09:50.890
Employees of the good old
Sevenson Insurance Company

09:51.048 --> 09:53.475
are gonna give me a
gold watch and a cake.

09:53.759 --> 09:58.031
I'm gonna clean out my desk.
And then we are off.

09:58.055 --> 10:00.399
Off where?

10:00.766 --> 10:03.736
You follow baseball, Charlie?

10:04.645 --> 10:06.405
I wanna see a game

10:06.522 --> 10:10.159
in every major-league
park in America.

10:10.234 --> 10:12.296
- We're gonna do it.
- Really?

10:12.320 --> 10:13.621
Yeah.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.507
That sounds great.

10:15.531 --> 10:17.634
We'll have a general plan, sure.

10:17.658 --> 10:19.303
A vague sense of the
route, absolutely,

10:19.327 --> 10:20.794
but no schedule.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.307
We'll just see where
the road takes us.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.590
Absolutely.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.436
Detours. Detours
are where it's at.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.179
You're a man after my
own heart, Charlie.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.973
You're away, kiddo.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.067
Miss Beaton?

10:44.226 --> 10:46.528
E-I or I-E? Does that...?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.081
Doesn't that look wrong to you?

10:48.105 --> 10:50.083
I keep having this
recurring nightmare

10:50.107 --> 10:51.460
where the Board of Education

10:51.484 --> 10:53.128
finds out I can't
spell worth a damn

10:53.152 --> 10:54.662
and yanks my license.

10:56.864 --> 10:58.332
I need your signature.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.000
On?

11:01.661 --> 11:03.180
You're transferring?

11:03.204 --> 11:04.806
Into wood shop.

11:04.830 --> 11:07.007
It was the only elective
that had a few open spaces.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.470
I got a 900.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.441
Total.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.517
Well, that's disappointing.

11:17.718 --> 11:20.688
Yeah, but let's be honest,
not a total shock.

11:21.138 --> 11:23.450
Probably about how well
you'd expect me to do.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.526
So I'm just gonna apply to
State and get it over with.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.663
Stop torturing myself applying
to all these Eastern schools.

11:28.687 --> 11:32.449
Okay, well, that's good to know.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.339
What's good to know?

11:37.363 --> 11:39.498
That that's your thinking.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.051
Because the worst thing
is investing in someone

11:41.075 --> 11:43.220
who's gonna split at the
first sign of trouble.

11:43.244 --> 11:46.213
Lesson I took from
my sordid love life.

11:46.288 --> 11:49.800
Look, it's nothing
personal or anything.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.353
I mean, you're a
really good teacher.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.979
I know that. No, I know
I'm a good teacher.

11:53.003 --> 11:54.064
I'm a great teacher.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.315
I can just be

11:55.339 --> 11:57.275
a really bad judge of
character, sometimes.

11:57.299 --> 11:58.693
I mean, a student laughs

11:58.717 --> 12:00.237
at some dumb joke of mine

12:00.261 --> 12:02.239
or does a "Yes!" when they
get a question right,

12:02.263 --> 12:04.440
and I think, "They're mine."

12:06.183 --> 12:08.068
And I thought I had
you, Bailey, but,

12:08.727 --> 12:10.487
you got away.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.035
Maybe it was the wontons.

12:17.361 --> 12:18.755
It wasn't the wontons.

12:18.779 --> 12:20.382
Could have been the Peking duck.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.050
It wasn't the Peking duck.

12:22.074 --> 12:24.344
Maybe it was that beige stuff.

12:24.368 --> 12:27.389
Oh, look, it wasn't the
beige stuff, okay?

12:27.413 --> 12:29.182
The beige stuff is
their specialty.

12:29.206 --> 12:30.267
The beige stuff was delicious.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.176
We all had four helpings
of the beige stuff,

12:32.209 --> 12:33.645
and you don't see the
three of us parked

12:33.669 --> 12:35.188
in the toilet for
30 minutes, do you?

12:35.212 --> 12:37.315
You know what a sensitive
stomach your mother has.

12:37.339 --> 12:38.733
Come on, Dad!

12:38.757 --> 12:40.235
Let's not pretend we don't
know what's happening.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.478
This is her revenge for letting
you pick the restaurant.

12:42.678 --> 12:45.147
Well, I'm worried. She's
been in there too long.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.941
Since you refuse
to look in on her,

12:48.058 --> 12:49.985
I just hope she didn't faint.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.790
You know what this
means, don't you?

12:53.814 --> 12:56.001
We shouldn't bother taking
the leftovers home?

12:56.025 --> 12:57.544
The Dee Young exhibit
starts at three.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.129
We're never gonna
make it in time.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.006
And plus, she's not
gonna wanna schlep

13:01.030 --> 13:03.415
all the way to Chez Panisse
for dinner after this.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.795
Okay. Okay, here's what we do.

13:07.828 --> 13:10.265
We get a dinner reservation
at Kuleto's for nine o'clock.

13:10.289 --> 13:13.008
If we leave in 15,
provided she's not dead,

13:13.042 --> 13:15.061
we hop a cable car
down to the wharf,

13:15.085 --> 13:16.480
check out Ghirardelli,
go back home,

13:16.504 --> 13:18.857
nap a couple of hours before
we head out to dinner.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.390
What do you think?

13:20.508 --> 13:22.309
What do I think?

13:22.968 --> 13:24.362
Feeling much better now.

13:24.386 --> 13:25.822
I think you sound exactly
like your mother.

13:25.846 --> 13:26.823
What?

13:26.847 --> 13:28.408
She's fine. Not to worry.

13:28.432 --> 13:30.118
- What's that mean?
- I am so sorry.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.953
You know, they had
the loveliest mural

13:31.977 --> 13:34.571
in that ladies' room.

13:42.446 --> 13:44.090
You know, we're not
gonna be quiet.

13:44.114 --> 13:45.342
So if that's what this is about,

13:45.366 --> 13:46.959
you should go work
somewhere else.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.044
Do you know anything
about radios?

13:49.578 --> 13:51.255
No.

13:53.749 --> 13:55.050
I mean, Griffin.

13:57.461 --> 14:00.806
We have this school project
to do something scientific,

14:00.965 --> 14:02.808
so I bought one of
those radio kits.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.277
Yeah, I got that.

14:04.301 --> 14:06.780
But I only have one good hand,

14:06.804 --> 14:08.823
and two hands are kind
of the bare minimum

14:08.847 --> 14:10.357
you need for radio building.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.819
So I was wondering...

14:26.574 --> 14:29.751
Yup. You got it
hooked up all wrong.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.048
What?

14:35.457 --> 14:37.310
Look, Justin and I were friends.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.854
That's all.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.680
I mean, that's... That's
the only reason...

14:41.839 --> 14:43.265
You know...

14:46.051 --> 14:47.352
Okay.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.656
I'm sort of an
acquired taste anyway.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.273
Oh, yeah?

14:51.557 --> 14:53.159
That's what people
say about me too.

14:53.183 --> 14:54.776
Is that right?

15:02.568 --> 15:04.244
I'm kicking my car.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.792
Better.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.513
What?

15:13.537 --> 15:14.973
I was just thinking that I...

15:14.997 --> 15:17.132
sort of know how that
car feels right now.

15:17.625 --> 15:18.935
I wasn't that hard on you.

15:18.959 --> 15:20.510
Anyway, you completely
deserved it.

15:22.212 --> 15:24.608
Listen, can I ask
you a huge favor?

15:24.632 --> 15:27.809
I have strategically locked
my keys inside my car.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.280
Can I get a lift? I have
an extra set at home,

15:30.304 --> 15:32.272
and I'm just through
the Presidio.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.483
- Hop in.
- Thanks.

15:36.644 --> 15:37.704
A jeep, huh?

15:37.728 --> 15:40.072
Maybe I should get one of
these, change my image.

15:40.397 --> 15:42.282
I guess.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.837
I was thinking that...

15:45.861 --> 15:47.088
maybe I should take

15:47.112 --> 15:48.089
the SATs again.

15:48.113 --> 15:49.591
Maybe.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.500
Bailey, that's great.
That's great!

15:51.867 --> 15:54.137
I had a feeling about you.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.963
I had a feeling
you'd come around.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.141
Oh, yeah?

15:58.165 --> 15:59.726
Yeah. We can start
prepping tomorrow.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.301
Why don't you come to my place?

16:02.044 --> 16:03.428
Your place?

16:04.463 --> 16:06.682
Yeah. I'll make lunch.
We'll make it fun.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.029
I'm really happy about this.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.563
I think you're gonna do great.
I guarantee it.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.327
Well, thanks, Miss Beaton.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.820
Oh, it's Maggie on weekends.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.572
Maggie.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.369
Maggie.

16:27.611 --> 16:30.205
I can't believe it! We did it!

16:30.572 --> 16:32.165
Let me tune it in for you.

16:32.282 --> 16:34.626
This is so cool!

16:37.371 --> 16:38.630
She's cute.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.976
It's been two hours. Can we...?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.843
Oh, right, right.

16:42.918 --> 16:44.761
Hey, I gotta go.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.353
Thanks.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.272
You're welcome.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.691
Come on.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.485
Why don't we...

17:01.228 --> 17:03.289
Why don't we make
it a threesome.

17:03.313 --> 17:05.198
Maybe we'll get a
pizza or something.

17:05.232 --> 17:06.450
Really?

17:06.525 --> 17:08.535
- Yeah. Sure.
- No!

17:09.069 --> 17:11.297
No. We're not gonna do that.

17:11.320 --> 17:13.508
- Why not?
- Because we're not.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.510
Because we have to go...

17:15.534 --> 17:16.886
to that club and see that band

17:16.910 --> 17:18.512
that you wanted to see,

17:18.537 --> 17:19.681
that are playing tonight,

17:19.704 --> 17:21.548
and you're too young.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.842
Sorry.

17:24.417 --> 17:25.719
Later?

17:26.545 --> 17:28.137
Yeah.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.021
Okay.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.024
How about that time we made
love in the laundry room?

17:40.809 --> 17:42.746
I give up. How about that time?

17:42.770 --> 17:44.914
Well, it was pretty spur
of the moment, wasn't it?

17:44.938 --> 17:46.406
Yeah.

17:46.857 --> 17:49.794
That was last year.

17:49.818 --> 17:52.005
And, I mean, deciding
to get married.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.882
For crying out loud,
that's a huge thing!

17:53.906 --> 17:55.759
That's huge!

17:55.783 --> 17:58.136
I mean, it's not like we
even debated about it.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.669
Where are you going with this?

17:59.870 --> 18:02.214
I don't always make plans.

18:02.289 --> 18:04.934
I mean, I was supposed to call
about the wedding napkins today.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.978
And you know what? I didn't.

18:07.002 --> 18:09.262
- What the hell?
- Kirsten...

18:11.006 --> 18:13.100
And I listen to you.

18:14.218 --> 18:17.113
I mean, I never roll my eyes

18:17.137 --> 18:19.407
when you're telling me
something really important

18:19.431 --> 18:21.743
or talk about you like
you're not even in the room.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.829
Right? Right?

18:24.853 --> 18:26.081
Right. You don't.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.989
You don't ever do that.

18:28.148 --> 18:30.835
And I touch you.

18:30.859 --> 18:33.161
All the time, don't I?

18:35.280 --> 18:38.375
I mean, she never touches him.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.879
She never looks at him
like she really wants him.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.632
And I want you.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.262
I'm nothing like her.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.098
Nothing.

19:00.389 --> 19:01.574
Okay, you see?

19:01.598 --> 19:03.493
You see how you keep wanting
to go with the answer

19:03.517 --> 19:04.869
that uses the same kind of word?

19:04.893 --> 19:06.329
"Ocean, tide, wave, raft."

19:06.353 --> 19:08.572
Yeah, that's gonna
almost always be wrong.

19:09.189 --> 19:12.659
So like D?

19:13.026 --> 19:14.504
"Temperate is to stormy."

19:14.528 --> 19:16.037
He's got it.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.340
By George, he's got it.

19:17.364 --> 19:18.842
Okay, this is where we
jump around singing

19:18.866 --> 19:20.333
"The Rain in Spain."

19:22.661 --> 19:24.504
<i>My Fair Lady?</i>

19:25.372 --> 19:26.882
God, I'm old.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.344
You're not that old.

19:31.753 --> 19:34.431
My guess would be...

19:36.508 --> 19:38.852
23, 24...

19:39.011 --> 19:40.572
24, right?

19:40.596 --> 19:42.824
- 25.
- 25.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.492
My brother's 25.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.035
Yikes, you're not gonna try

19:46.059 --> 19:47.903
and fix me up with him, are you?

19:48.061 --> 19:50.322
With Charlie? No.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.491
No, no, no, no, no.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.034
Anyway he's getting married.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.994
And, besides,

19:56.153 --> 19:58.121
he's not nearly good
enough for you.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.753
Okay, let's talk
sentence completion.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.589
Sentence completion.

20:07.831 --> 20:11.009
Sentence completion.
I'm kind of fried.

20:12.085 --> 20:13.637
Nope.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.347
Nope?

20:15.797 --> 20:17.317
Nope. You're not fried.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.776
We've only been at
this three hours.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.102
You're not allowed to
even approach fried.

20:21.261 --> 20:23.480
Bailey, you can do this.

20:23.639 --> 20:26.525
It's not impossible. It's
not even very difficult.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.152
It is for me.

20:29.269 --> 20:30.580
No. You...

20:30.604 --> 20:31.988
You can't think like that.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.042
See, it's a question

20:34.066 --> 20:36.034
of coming at a problem
from a new direction.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.870
The key is to not rule
anything out because...

20:39.238 --> 20:42.707
sometimes the last answer
in the world you'd expect

20:43.533 --> 20:45.502
turns out to be the right one.

20:56.546 --> 20:58.524
- Griffin?
- Yeah.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.652
I got us tickets to the car show

21:00.676 --> 21:01.694
at the Cow Palace.

21:01.718 --> 21:03.311
The car show?

21:03.929 --> 21:05.897
That sounds right up your alley.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.276
This is for him?

21:09.768 --> 21:11.069
Yep.

21:11.895 --> 21:13.405
That's cool.

21:17.651 --> 21:18.795
Thanks.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.496
I've never had an ice
cream for lunch.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.873
I've never been on a
motorcycle, either.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.418
Yeah, well, there's a first
time for everything.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.471
After this, I'll take you
to the shooting range.

21:28.495 --> 21:29.931
Shooting range?

21:29.955 --> 21:31.715
I'm kidding. Jeez.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.011
Hey, you see that guy up there?

21:36.044 --> 21:37.637
The one with the racing forms?

21:37.754 --> 21:39.357
- Yeah.
- He just got out of jail.

21:39.381 --> 21:40.557
What?

21:40.757 --> 21:42.267
Ten years in San Quentin.

21:42.592 --> 21:44.612
Killed a man with
his bare hands.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.814
You know him? He did, really?

21:49.266 --> 21:50.859
He did not.

21:50.892 --> 21:52.819
You were making that up.

21:55.522 --> 21:57.449
Hey, that chick over there
with the bad dye job.

21:57.482 --> 21:58.376
Yeah.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.244
She's breaking up with
her boyfriend because...

22:01.778 --> 22:03.673
Well, see, last night they
were doing it, right?

22:03.697 --> 22:06.416
And he called her Sheryl.

22:07.951 --> 22:09.294
Her name's Edith.

22:11.038 --> 22:12.422
All right. You try.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.801
That guy over there
with the gloves.

22:17.294 --> 22:19.480
Okay. Okay, okay, let's see.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.566
He's wearing gloves because...

22:21.590 --> 22:23.016
Because...

22:23.550 --> 22:24.777
Well, because he...

22:24.801 --> 22:26.478
- Because...
- Tick, tick, tick...

22:26.970 --> 22:29.198
Because he doesn't
want his date to know

22:29.222 --> 22:31.868
that he lost his,
pointer finger,

22:31.892 --> 22:32.952
trying to dig,

22:32.976 --> 22:35.445
a paper clip out of
the garbage disposal,

22:36.229 --> 22:37.540
while it was running.

22:37.564 --> 22:38.958
Excellent.

22:38.982 --> 22:41.076
You get extra points for
seriously gruesome.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.582
I'm wearing my bracelet.

22:48.825 --> 22:50.335
Did you see?

22:58.460 --> 23:00.063
First one to the rock rules.

23:00.087 --> 23:02.013
No fair. You got a head start.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.862
So for the ceremony, we'll just
set up chairs in the back yard

23:07.886 --> 23:09.572
and we'll put the flowers
over the arbor...

23:09.596 --> 23:12.273
Gene, I gotta show
you something.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.078
It's my dad.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.370
And his dad.

23:16.394 --> 23:18.113
At Ebbets Field.

23:18.688 --> 23:20.458
He was just a kid, you know,
before the Dodgers left.

23:20.482 --> 23:22.826
Ebbets Field. How about that?

23:23.068 --> 23:24.462
Yeah, it just made me think

23:24.486 --> 23:26.089
that before they tear
down all the great parks,

23:26.113 --> 23:27.497
you gotta make that
trip of yours.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.000
- What's this?
- Nothing.

23:31.284 --> 23:33.086
Gene was just telling
me about your plan.

23:33.411 --> 23:35.139
You know, to visit every
park in the majors.

23:35.163 --> 23:36.808
Every park in the majors?

23:36.832 --> 23:38.967
- Sounds like fun, Dad.
- Doesn't it?

23:39.084 --> 23:40.760
Oh, please!

23:42.587 --> 23:43.815
What?

23:43.839 --> 23:45.733
I haven't heard
this one yet, dear.

23:45.757 --> 23:47.527
At least it doesn't require
us selling the house.

23:47.551 --> 23:48.694
Why don't we change the subject?

23:48.718 --> 23:49.904
Have you told Charlie

23:49.928 --> 23:51.864
about that scheme to buy
shares in golf courses?

23:51.888 --> 23:53.616
Your daddy was
gonna retire early

23:53.640 --> 23:55.243
and become a golf
course landlord.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.787
We would have lost thousands
if I had not stepped in.

23:57.811 --> 24:00.164
- Would you please stop?
- Why? It's adorable.

24:00.188 --> 24:02.157
I married the original
Innocent Man.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.145
I apologize.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.105
I don't know what's
gotten into your father.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.430
I can't stand it.

24:25.505 --> 24:26.941
I can't stand the way
you talk to him,

24:26.965 --> 24:30.101
the way you criticize and
nitpick and belittle!

24:30.385 --> 24:32.270
How dare you?

24:32.971 --> 24:35.241
How dare you? I
love your father.

24:35.265 --> 24:37.118
How? By embarrassing him?

24:37.142 --> 24:38.318
Oh, please.

24:39.227 --> 24:40.445
Please!

24:41.479 --> 24:42.540
Do you know how
many times a year

24:42.564 --> 24:44.240
I walk in on a
conversation like that?

24:44.524 --> 24:46.127
Where your father
has told someone

24:46.151 --> 24:47.461
that we're gonna sell the house

24:47.485 --> 24:49.537
and set out on some
new adventure?

24:50.405 --> 24:52.790
We're gonna go to
Africa or Alaska

24:52.824 --> 24:55.251
or visit every battlefield
of the Civil War.

24:55.785 --> 24:57.847
And everybody is always onboard,

24:57.871 --> 25:01.007
because there's just
something about a dreamer.

25:03.543 --> 25:06.105
And then it's my turn
to come in and say,

25:06.129 --> 25:07.347
"No, dear.

25:07.505 --> 25:09.483
We are not selling the house.

25:09.507 --> 25:11.559
We are not going to Alaska,

25:12.761 --> 25:16.064
because you don't make the kind
of money to retire like that."

25:16.431 --> 25:18.701
"And besides, you've never
been able to make a decision

25:18.725 --> 25:20.443
for more than a day ahead."

25:20.852 --> 25:24.081
So that makes him the good
guy and me the bad guy,

25:24.105 --> 25:26.407
even with you and your sister.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.576
That's not true.

25:29.527 --> 25:31.412
Always said yes to you.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.791
Yes to the dress.
Yes to the car.

25:34.991 --> 25:36.385
Even when you had
too many dresses

25:36.409 --> 25:37.835
and we couldn't afford the car.

25:42.999 --> 25:44.467
So,

25:45.210 --> 25:46.844
he got your love.

25:48.838 --> 25:50.932
But I'm the one who
made you responsible.

25:52.884 --> 25:54.185
I...

25:56.554 --> 25:58.481
I'm sorry, Mom.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.316
About what?

26:00.850 --> 26:03.037
That's who we are,
your father and I.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.914
That's the bargain we
made with each other.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.999
He dreams, and I pull
him back down to earth.

26:07.023 --> 26:09.877
I make sure that he has
a house to come home to

26:09.901 --> 26:11.420
and that there's
food on the table

26:11.444 --> 26:13.746
and the same program
on the television.

26:13.863 --> 26:16.499
Because that is what
really makes him happy.

26:19.286 --> 26:20.628
And you know what?

26:24.499 --> 26:27.594
I have a feeling it's the
same with you and Charlie.

26:34.009 --> 26:35.236
Hold on, you little monkey.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.570
I just got a few
more steps to go.

26:36.594 --> 26:38.906
Sixty-nine, 70, 71.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.565
One more! Seventy-two!

26:40.598 --> 26:42.108
You weigh a ton.

26:45.395 --> 26:46.831
You were out with her?

26:46.855 --> 26:48.749
Julia, we were
playing this game...

26:48.773 --> 26:50.408
Shut up, Claudia.

26:51.234 --> 26:52.910
Do you know what time it is?

26:53.194 --> 26:55.464
I mean, do you have any idea how
long I've been waiting for you?

26:55.488 --> 26:57.999
We had tickets to
that stupid car show.

26:58.199 --> 26:59.459
Remember?

27:00.493 --> 27:02.670
Oh, man! Right.

27:02.871 --> 27:04.265
Get out of here, Claud.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.799
- But he...
- Get out of here!

27:08.043 --> 27:09.802
See you.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.930
God.

27:13.423 --> 27:14.766
I'm like...

27:15.383 --> 27:18.978
I am doing somersaults
to get your attention.

27:19.304 --> 27:22.199
But it's like everything is
more important to you than me.

27:22.223 --> 27:25.318
I mean, you're doing all this
stuff to make Claudia happy.

27:25.518 --> 27:27.403
Why can't you do that for me?

27:27.562 --> 27:31.157
I mean, why can't you
do something for me?

27:31.316 --> 27:32.825
I...

27:33.735 --> 27:35.787
Look, I'm sorry.

27:36.488 --> 27:37.997
Just...

27:39.115 --> 27:40.958
Can you leave?

27:41.910 --> 27:43.670
I want you to leave.

27:52.545 --> 27:54.097
Why are you being like this?

27:55.799 --> 27:57.443
I mean, at first you wanted
me to be nice to him,

27:57.467 --> 27:58.861
and now you get so angry

27:58.885 --> 28:00.812
any time he wants to
do something with me.

28:01.596 --> 28:02.823
What, are...?

28:02.847 --> 28:04.367
Are you jealous or something?

28:04.391 --> 28:05.608
What?

28:05.767 --> 28:08.204
That is the stupidest thing
I have ever heard, Claudia!

28:08.228 --> 28:10.405
Why would I be jealous
of you and Griffin?

28:12.023 --> 28:13.250
Because.

28:13.274 --> 28:15.086
What, do you have, like,

28:15.110 --> 28:16.462
a little crush on
him or something?

28:16.486 --> 28:17.463
That is so...

28:17.487 --> 28:18.756
Shut up, Jule.

28:18.780 --> 28:21.165
I promise you, he
is not interested.

28:21.324 --> 28:22.750
Okay.

28:23.451 --> 28:25.513
I mean, the reason he's
hanging around with you

28:25.537 --> 28:27.556
is because he feels
sorry for you,

28:27.580 --> 28:30.883
because you have a broken arm,
and you have hardly any friends.

28:31.334 --> 28:33.229
That is not a date, Claudia,

28:33.253 --> 28:35.012
it's called baby-sitting.

28:39.884 --> 28:41.936
Nine hundred? That's
exactly the same.

28:42.971 --> 28:45.658
But if you look, you'll see you
did much better on the verbal.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.493
I thought what happened
was you got tired...

28:47.517 --> 28:50.111
It's exactly the same.

28:51.187 --> 28:52.739
Bailey...

28:53.898 --> 28:55.450
You see, I...

28:57.110 --> 28:59.078
You should've listened to me.

28:59.487 --> 29:03.082
I can't do this stuff, okay?
I'm just not good at it.

29:03.575 --> 29:04.751
I'm...

29:05.493 --> 29:07.587
Kind of stupid is what I am.

29:08.329 --> 29:09.348
You're not stupid.

29:09.372 --> 29:11.100
You're having trouble
with the test.

29:11.124 --> 29:12.393
We've worked on it for one day.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.760
Would you cut it out?

29:14.836 --> 29:17.096
You are part of
the problem here.

29:18.339 --> 29:20.016
You don't have to lie to me.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.852
I can handle it.

29:24.053 --> 29:26.105
I'll just apply to State, and...

29:26.765 --> 29:28.441
And that's that.

29:29.934 --> 29:32.070
I wonder what things are
like for you at home.

29:32.520 --> 29:33.664
What?

29:33.688 --> 29:35.416
I know things have changed.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.741
Things are fine, thanks.

29:36.983 --> 29:38.409
Yeah, I'm sure they are.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.463
You come to school every day.

29:40.487 --> 29:42.757
You're healthy.
You're taken care of.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.291
But nobody holds you
accountable, do they, Bailey?

29:46.034 --> 29:49.587
I mean, if you screw up,
or you fail, or you quit,

29:51.164 --> 29:52.757
does anyone mind?

29:53.958 --> 29:57.053
Does anyone tell you
that you can do better?

30:01.966 --> 30:03.392
Hi, Gene.

30:05.929 --> 30:08.147
Getting some tips on
bathroom placement.

30:09.766 --> 30:11.567
Ellie and I are adding
on to the house.

30:12.519 --> 30:14.070
Space for the grandkids.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.197
That's great.

30:17.106 --> 30:19.242
After you get back from
all those ballparks, huh?

30:22.695 --> 30:24.757
I don't think that's
gonna happen.

30:24.781 --> 30:26.749
It's a good idea.
You gotta do it.

30:27.659 --> 30:28.636
Come on.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.931
You've been working for what, 30 years?
You deserve it.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.256
Charlie, listen.

30:35.166 --> 30:37.770
Every month, <i>National
Geographic</i> comes.

30:37.794 --> 30:40.105
I sit in my chair, and I read.

30:40.129 --> 30:43.108
And there's some article
about, I don't know,

30:43.132 --> 30:45.653
state fairs in America,

30:45.677 --> 30:48.855
or floating down
the Mekong River.

30:49.222 --> 30:53.025
And in my mind, I
sell the house,

30:53.935 --> 30:56.237
I cash in my jumbo CD

30:56.771 --> 30:58.364
and I'm gone.

31:05.572 --> 31:07.957
A few weeks of daydreaming.
That's...

31:08.783 --> 31:10.084
That's good enough.

31:10.535 --> 31:11.878
Why?

31:13.538 --> 31:15.256
Why does that have
to be good enough?

31:15.582 --> 31:17.560
I mean, it's not inevitable

31:17.584 --> 31:19.927
that you're gonna have to
give up on every idea.

31:20.795 --> 31:22.147
So it's a little crazy.

31:22.171 --> 31:23.639
So what?

31:24.090 --> 31:27.560
And this one is possible, Gene.
This one you could really do.

31:28.553 --> 31:29.896
This is better.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.774
This is what Ellie wants.
She's right.

31:33.933 --> 31:35.494
Charlie, there are worse things

31:35.518 --> 31:38.529
than growing old in the house
where your children were born.

31:43.651 --> 31:45.536
Why does it matter
to you so much?

31:48.698 --> 31:50.082
I don't know.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.295
It just does.

32:06.466 --> 32:07.892
Hey.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.519
You hiding down here?

32:10.720 --> 32:13.272
I'm looking for the waffle iron.

32:13.473 --> 32:16.025
Ellie woke up with a
craving, bless her heart.

32:17.143 --> 32:18.486
So...

32:19.771 --> 32:21.239
So I was thinking that...

32:22.106 --> 32:24.283
I don't think I'm gonna
take the SATs over again.

32:24.442 --> 32:26.077
How did you do?

32:26.361 --> 32:27.954
Nine hundred.

32:29.322 --> 32:30.831
Combined.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.501
I think that's about what I did.

32:34.118 --> 32:36.128
Yeah, so you took it.

32:36.496 --> 32:39.340
Don't put yourself through that
stress again, man. Who needs it?

32:40.959 --> 32:43.386
So that's it?

32:44.963 --> 32:46.690
You're not gonna...

32:46.714 --> 32:48.391
You're not gonna
give me a hard time?

32:49.342 --> 32:50.643
Nah.

33:00.061 --> 33:01.696
Hey, Char.

33:03.064 --> 33:04.458
When you dropped out of school,

33:04.482 --> 33:08.577
did anyone, like, try
and talk you out of it?

33:08.945 --> 33:10.246
Are you kidding, man?

33:10.571 --> 33:13.050
You could hear Dad yelling
from across the bridge.

33:13.074 --> 33:16.419
Yeah, I do, kind
of remember that.

33:17.286 --> 33:20.599
It was like he was... He was
expecting me to disappoint him.

33:20.623 --> 33:21.642
And...

33:21.666 --> 33:25.344
dropping out was just one
more item on the checklist.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.888
But, Mom, she...

33:29.340 --> 33:32.393
She knew the Berkeley thing was
just about me running scared.

33:33.302 --> 33:35.563
She left me alone for
a couple of months.

33:36.097 --> 33:37.690
I don't know how she did it.

33:38.474 --> 33:39.775
Did what?

33:40.476 --> 33:42.579
I was gonna re-enroll
for the spring semester

33:42.603 --> 33:44.447
when the accident happened.

33:45.314 --> 33:47.074
But you knew that, right?

33:48.401 --> 33:50.036
Yeah, Mom, she...

33:51.320 --> 33:54.123
She had that complete
faith thing going.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.585
Well, you remember.

34:04.584 --> 34:07.428
So, what is this, an apology?

34:08.087 --> 34:09.472
No.

34:10.590 --> 34:11.974
It's a necklace.

34:12.050 --> 34:16.112
Man, you're really into this
say-it-with-jewelry thing, huh?

34:16.137 --> 34:17.906
First Claud, and now me.

34:17.929 --> 34:19.190
It was Jill's.

34:30.985 --> 34:32.420
Are you sure you wanna...?

34:32.445 --> 34:33.621
Yeah.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.040
Yeah, I'm sure.

34:37.867 --> 34:40.554
You know, this was...

34:40.578 --> 34:44.422
This was, like, the first
thing I bought her that...

34:44.706 --> 34:48.552
wasn't, like, a tambourine
or a doll or something.

34:51.505 --> 34:52.889
Put it on?

34:59.138 --> 35:00.898
She was...

35:01.057 --> 35:04.026
She was always following me
around when we were kids.

35:04.268 --> 35:05.662
Like, everywhere.

35:05.686 --> 35:07.113
Drove me nuts.

35:09.273 --> 35:10.658
But...

35:11.859 --> 35:14.453
Then one day I just
got used to it.

35:15.404 --> 35:18.499
Like, her being one step
behind me all the time.

35:21.327 --> 35:22.628
It was nice.

35:25.123 --> 35:29.552
Like, this one time
when I was, like, 14,

35:31.587 --> 35:34.765
I wore these
different-colored socks.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.518
Totally by mistake.

35:38.636 --> 35:40.521
And then she started
doing it too.

35:40.763 --> 35:42.523
Like it was cool.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.067
Like I was cool.

35:46.602 --> 35:47.778
Go figure, right?

35:51.774 --> 35:53.701
And at the breakfast
table, we...

35:55.403 --> 35:57.788
We used to play this game
called Make Me Laugh.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.791
Claud and I play that.

36:06.539 --> 36:07.840
See...

36:07.874 --> 36:09.550
it's different...

36:10.168 --> 36:11.802
with a girlfriend.

36:13.963 --> 36:15.639
That's all I'm saying.

36:18.759 --> 36:20.019
It's...

36:22.263 --> 36:24.523
With a girlfriend, it's...

36:25.099 --> 36:26.650
It's just

36:27.602 --> 36:29.069
different.

36:35.401 --> 36:37.536
She was my little
sister, you know.

36:51.250 --> 36:53.353
So if we push this wall out,

36:53.377 --> 36:54.855
it gives us a family room.

36:54.879 --> 36:56.472
Plus the extra bedroom.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.066
- That sounds great.
- Yeah.

36:58.090 --> 36:59.151
That's great.

36:59.175 --> 37:00.694
Yeah, except now we
need to find space

37:00.718 --> 37:01.862
for another bathroom.

37:01.886 --> 37:04.406
Right. Okay, well,
what about here?

37:04.430 --> 37:07.618
Well, we thought of that, but I
think that's a bearing wall.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.077
- Oh.
- Remember bearing walls?

37:09.101 --> 37:10.611
Yes.

37:11.604 --> 37:13.957
So, what do you think?

37:13.981 --> 37:16.283
Can we pull this off
for under $50,000?

37:17.026 --> 37:18.619
I wouldn't know.

37:21.989 --> 37:24.542
You don't like me much, do you?

37:26.661 --> 37:27.679
Come on, Ellie.

37:27.703 --> 37:29.547
You're angry with me.
That's pretty clear.

37:30.373 --> 37:32.508
Think I took something
away from him?

37:33.167 --> 37:34.228
I promise you, Charlie,

37:34.252 --> 37:36.303
he's not giving up half
as much as he's getting.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.472
Maybe.

37:43.135 --> 37:45.521
You know, for what it's worth,

37:46.138 --> 37:49.034
I completely understand
why Kirsten loves you.

37:49.058 --> 37:52.079
It's the same quality I fell
in love with in her father.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.623
That feeling of always being
just a little bit lost

37:54.647 --> 37:56.166
and constantly restless.

37:56.190 --> 37:59.451
Yeah, well, I don't think
you understand me at all.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.464
I mean, I don't know if Kirsten's
told you about my plans...

38:02.488 --> 38:03.872
Charlie.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.927
I know about the restaurant
and the house-building

38:06.951 --> 38:08.637
and the furniture business.

38:08.661 --> 38:12.506
I'm not lost, okay?
I'm just looking.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.393
It's not the same thing.

38:14.417 --> 38:15.852
I'm just...

38:15.876 --> 38:17.344
not finished looking yet.

38:19.422 --> 38:21.066
And Kirsten understands that.

38:21.090 --> 38:22.433
I mean, she's looking too.

38:22.883 --> 38:24.403
And when I figure
out what I want...

38:24.427 --> 38:25.487
What we want.

38:25.511 --> 38:27.572
It's gonna be exactly
what we want.

38:27.596 --> 38:29.366
It's not gonna have anything
to do with settling.

38:29.390 --> 38:30.816
So, I mean,

38:31.892 --> 38:33.370
you and Gene, you do
whatever you need to do.

38:33.394 --> 38:34.612
I just...

38:34.729 --> 38:35.914
I shouldn't have
gotten involved,

38:35.938 --> 38:37.656
'cause it really has
nothing to do with me.

38:48.492 --> 38:49.918
What you doin'?

38:51.746 --> 38:53.047
Nothing.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.799
I'm just gonna drop
my stuff in my tent.

38:57.460 --> 38:58.687
Where are you going?

38:58.711 --> 39:00.262
I'm leaving.

39:00.629 --> 39:02.556
I won't bug you, I promise.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.768
You should stay.

39:08.971 --> 39:10.198
Stay.

39:10.222 --> 39:11.783
I'm gonna go.

39:11.807 --> 39:13.535
I've gotta...

39:13.559 --> 39:15.152
do some homework.

39:16.103 --> 39:17.706
I really don't get it.

39:17.730 --> 39:19.073
Oh, come on, Claud.

39:19.148 --> 39:20.491
Give me a break.

39:21.734 --> 39:23.295
I'm trying to say I'm sorry.

39:23.319 --> 39:24.995
I guess I can get,

39:25.446 --> 39:27.790
kind of mean when I get jealous.

39:28.074 --> 39:30.626
And I wish I could take
back everything I said,

39:31.369 --> 39:32.554
but I can't.

39:32.578 --> 39:34.129
So...

39:34.163 --> 39:36.340
You two should do
something together.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.684
You don't have to
baby-sit me, you know.

39:46.884 --> 39:49.071
What are you talking about?
I just got dumped here.

39:49.095 --> 39:50.646
I'm lucky to have the date.

39:53.349 --> 39:55.859
So, what do you say? You
wanna hit the park again?

39:56.394 --> 39:58.070
Been there, done that.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.239
Yeah, right.

40:03.526 --> 40:04.785
You got a piano.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.537
One hand.

40:07.738 --> 40:09.456
Makes two.

40:11.242 --> 40:13.053
No way! You have the easy part.

40:13.077 --> 40:14.545
Yeah.

40:14.620 --> 40:16.422
Did you have a piano growing up?

40:17.832 --> 40:21.844
Yeah. Yeah, I used to
do this all the time.

40:22.336 --> 40:24.388
A long time ago.

40:34.223 --> 40:35.566
She's got it.

40:36.350 --> 40:37.693
She's got it.

40:39.228 --> 40:41.113
I'm sure you'll be
relieved to know

40:41.730 --> 40:43.083
for the wedding weekend,

40:43.107 --> 40:45.909
Ellie and I have already
booked a room at the Fairmont.

40:46.485 --> 40:48.162
Really, Gene, are you sure?

40:49.280 --> 40:51.415
Can I confirm that
reservation for you?

40:53.284 --> 40:56.096
<i>Flight 97 direct to
O'Hare is now boarding...</i>

40:56.120 --> 40:57.222
That's you.

40:57.246 --> 40:58.672
What happened to...

41:03.043 --> 41:05.230
Mom, what are you doing?

41:05.254 --> 41:06.982
We're gonna see each other
in a couple of weeks.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.557
I know.

41:10.384 --> 41:14.406
Now, look, I know we don't
always see things the same way,

41:14.430 --> 41:15.606
and...

41:16.599 --> 41:19.244
I am not the easiest person in
the world to get along with.

41:19.268 --> 41:20.736
That's okay.

41:21.604 --> 41:24.531
Mom, it's okay.

41:27.401 --> 41:29.119
I love you too.

41:35.534 --> 41:36.835
Daddy.

41:38.913 --> 41:39.848
Sweetheart.

41:39.872 --> 41:42.392
We'll call and let you know
we got home safe and sound.

41:42.416 --> 41:44.060
Collect. Only don't...

41:44.084 --> 41:46.438
Accept the charges.
I know, I know.

41:46.462 --> 41:47.981
See? I taught her very well.

41:48.005 --> 41:49.691
Goodbye, Charlie.

41:49.715 --> 41:51.391
Safe flight, Ellie.

42:05.189 --> 42:09.076
Well, that wasn't
so bad, was it?

42:11.111 --> 42:12.579
Hello?

42:13.447 --> 42:15.749
Where have you been
the last four days?

42:17.743 --> 42:19.002
Well, okay.

42:19.495 --> 42:20.805
For the most part,

42:20.829 --> 42:21.973
yes, it sucked.

42:21.997 --> 42:23.841
But there were moments.

42:27.211 --> 42:28.647
They're actually happy.

42:28.671 --> 42:31.682
I mean, they don't
need anything else.

42:32.299 --> 42:33.767
Just each other.

42:34.677 --> 42:36.645
And I understand that.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.731
I know how that feels.

42:41.892 --> 42:44.528
'Cause everything I
want in the world...

42:45.229 --> 42:47.406
I have right now.

42:53.070 --> 42:55.622
Let's just stay until
they take off, okay?

42:56.532 --> 42:58.083
Sure.

43:11.171 --> 43:14.359
<i>When someone is gone from your
life for a really long time,</i>

43:14.383 --> 43:16.852
<i>you start to forget
stuff about them.</i>

43:17.803 --> 43:20.991
<i>Like, you forget what
their voice sounded like.</i>

43:21.015 --> 43:23.243
<i>Or how they loved you so much</i>

43:23.267 --> 43:25.996
<i>and how everything you did was
completely okay with them.</i>

43:26.020 --> 43:28.498
<i>And how that meant,
in a weird way,</i>

43:28.522 --> 43:31.199
<i>that you could actually
do amazing things.</i>

43:33.027 --> 43:35.412
<i>I'm not a very good student,</i>

43:35.654 --> 43:38.332
<i>and applying to college
isn't so easy for me.</i>

43:38.616 --> 43:41.303
<i>So right now, what I am doing</i>

43:41.327 --> 43:44.212
<i>is I'm trying very hard to
remember my mother's voice.</i>

43:45.623 --> 43:48.518
<i>Because I really
need to hear it now.</i>

43:48.542 --> 43:50.478
<i>I'm listening for
her to say to me</i>

43:50.502 --> 43:52.647
<i>what she always used to say:</i>

43:52.671 --> 43:56.767
<i>"Anything is possible, Bailey.
Anything."</i>
