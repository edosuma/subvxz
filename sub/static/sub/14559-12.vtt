00:01.735 --> 00:04.138
-(The Fratellis' "Baby Fratelli"
playing) -* Whoo! *

00:09.077 --> 00:10.711
* I said, oh, my *

00:10.778 --> 00:12.613
* Oh, no, no, I *

00:12.680 --> 00:16.517
* I was just busy watching
everyone go by *

00:16.584 --> 00:18.419
* Outside the shite bar *

00:18.486 --> 00:20.488
* In your old red car *

00:20.554 --> 00:21.622
* Me and your girlfriend *

00:21.689 --> 00:24.392
* And your sister
with the big scar *

00:24.458 --> 00:26.160
* And I said, oh, Christ! *

00:26.227 --> 00:27.795
* And I told you twice *

00:27.861 --> 00:29.930
* It's just not easy
going through *

00:29.997 --> 00:31.999
* All these things thrice *

00:32.066 --> 00:33.801
* What's this I once heard *

00:33.867 --> 00:34.868
* You drive a bluebird *

00:34.935 --> 00:37.037
* You got no money
for the petrol... *

00:37.105 --> 00:39.807
(siren chirping)

00:39.873 --> 00:42.876
* And it's all right *

00:42.943 --> 00:47.181
* She'll be sucking fingers
all night *

00:47.248 --> 00:48.949
(song continues indistinctly)

00:49.016 --> 00:50.951
(indistinct police radio
communication)

00:51.018 --> 00:55.823
* ...so easy to be
Friday's nightmare... *

00:55.889 --> 00:58.092
(guitar riff plays)

00:58.159 --> 01:01.195
Hi. Llap-Goch--
you ever hear of that?

01:01.262 --> 01:03.097
You take me out before
I even do anything.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.798
Monty Python.

01:04.865 --> 01:05.799
"Fear no man!"

01:05.866 --> 01:07.468
(echoing): License
and registration, ma'am.

01:07.535 --> 01:08.836
Sure, sure.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.071
I admit it, I had a little wine,

01:11.139 --> 01:14.808
but, but I didn't do anything.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.777
I don't think
you have a case for...

01:16.844 --> 01:18.712
You're driving the wrong
way on a one-way street.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.248
Really?

01:20.314 --> 01:21.849
That's not good.

01:21.915 --> 01:22.650
Where's the sign?

01:22.716 --> 01:23.884
Step out
of the vehicle, ma'am.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.253
Okay.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.155
Okay, but listen,
I got to talk to you.

01:27.221 --> 01:28.522
(stammering):
This is a mistake.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.292
I-I made a mistake,
but I can't get arrested.

01:31.359 --> 01:33.861
Okay, seriously,
th-that would be bad.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.229
Please, Occifer...

01:35.296 --> 01:37.598
(laughing):
...what is your name?

01:41.835 --> 01:44.272
So... shall we call it

01:44.338 --> 01:47.040
"matrix theory
with combinatorics"?

01:47.107 --> 01:49.677
How about
"matrix theory

01:49.743 --> 01:52.280
for infinite-
dimensional matrices"?

01:52.346 --> 01:53.814
We could teach it together.

01:53.881 --> 01:54.748
That's a good idea.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.884
When are you free
to plan lectures?

01:56.950 --> 02:01.655
Uh, well,
I am teaching until 4:00

02:01.722 --> 02:04.158
and then I have office hours
until 6:00,

02:04.225 --> 02:07.795
but how about after that
over dinner?

02:07.861 --> 02:08.796
Sure.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.264
Great.

02:10.331 --> 02:11.365
-Mm.
-Mm.

02:11.432 --> 02:12.833
Oh, Charlie, I have
to ask you a favor.

02:12.900 --> 02:16.504
Um, my apartment building
is getting tented this weekend.

02:16.570 --> 02:17.538
Oh, no.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.340
And I was wondering
if I could stay with you.

02:19.407 --> 02:21.442
It'll be a great
experiment.

02:21.509 --> 02:25.045
You mean what it would be like
to stay in the same house

02:25.112 --> 02:26.614
with your father
for more than one night?

02:26.680 --> 02:28.516
Right, and how
we get along--

02:28.582 --> 02:30.318
if we're at each
other's throats,

02:30.384 --> 02:32.686
who cooks,
who watches TV

02:32.753 --> 02:34.021
while the other
one cleans.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.122
I'm gonna stay in a hotel.

02:35.189 --> 02:38.326
No, we need simulations
for our game theory algorithm

02:38.392 --> 02:39.860
to determine what
our next step

02:39.927 --> 02:41.128
should be as a couple.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.996
Well, maybe
our next step

02:43.063 --> 02:45.533
should be you and me
in a hotel.

02:49.337 --> 02:52.440
Let's get some data.

02:54.041 --> 02:54.975
How's this
to start your morning?

02:55.042 --> 02:55.776
Hey.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.445
We got an anonymous tip
to our Web site

02:57.511 --> 03:00.714
from a woman who claims she was
raped by an LAPD officer.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.015
Anonymous?

03:02.082 --> 03:05.819
Well, the copy shop downtown
made the tipster show I.D.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.421
Her name is
Rena Vining.

03:07.488 --> 03:08.889
All right, well,
you should interview her

03:08.956 --> 03:11.359
and you should liaise
with LAPD, right?

03:11.425 --> 03:12.693
Before we know if there's merit?

03:12.760 --> 03:14.795
Yeah, I mean, they're under
a federal consent decree.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.297
(doorbell rings)

03:21.269 --> 03:23.203
Rena Vining?

03:23.271 --> 03:26.240
I'm Megan Reeves
from the FBI.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.975
So much for anonymity.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.877
You can't accuse a
police officer of rape

03:29.943 --> 03:30.911
and just walk away...

03:30.978 --> 03:32.913
unless it's not true.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.449
That's where you want
to start-- that I'm a liar?

03:35.516 --> 03:38.218
Why don't you just tell me
what happened?

03:38.286 --> 03:42.189
It's in my e-mail.

03:42.256 --> 03:45.192
Unmarked car,
white cop under 40,

03:45.259 --> 03:47.328
brown hair, dark blue uniform,

03:47.395 --> 03:48.496
stopped me
for drunk driving,

03:48.562 --> 03:50.798
said he'd be a nice guy
and give me a ride home.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.433
He helped me
to my door

03:52.500 --> 03:54.001
because I was having trouble
walking.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.068
Next thing I know,

03:55.135 --> 03:58.238
I wake up naked on the floor
and I've lost a day.

03:58.306 --> 03:59.307
He was in this apartment?

03:59.373 --> 04:01.442
It's hazy, but yeah.

04:01.509 --> 04:03.544
I'm sure he drugged me.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.145
He gave me a bottle of water
in his car.

04:05.212 --> 04:07.448
It's pretty much the last
thing I remember clearly.

04:07.515 --> 04:09.750
But if you have no memory,

04:09.817 --> 04:11.852
how can you be sure
that you were raped?

04:12.753 --> 04:15.656
I had dried semen on my body.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.659
I have injuries.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.394
Did you go to an
emergency room?

04:20.461 --> 04:21.729
Don't touch me.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.764
No, I didn't go
to the emergency room.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.299
I stood in the shower
for an hour

04:25.366 --> 04:27.234
and tried to get
him off of me.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.369
I just want to go
back to work,

04:28.436 --> 04:29.370
back to my life.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.171
I don't want to be a victim.

04:31.238 --> 04:32.440
Then why'd you contact us?

04:32.506 --> 04:34.342
Someone should stop him.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.676
Calling LAPD seemed
like a bad idea.

04:35.743 --> 04:36.677
Another cop
might tell him

04:36.744 --> 04:40.147
and... he knows where I live.

04:40.213 --> 04:41.148
Rena,

04:41.214 --> 04:42.282
if you want to follow this up,

04:42.350 --> 04:44.618
you're going to have to go
to the hospital and get tested,

04:44.685 --> 04:45.886
and we're going
to need to check

04:45.953 --> 04:46.820
for fingerprints
and DNA.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.356
I don't want anybody to know.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.324
We can protect
your identity.

04:50.391 --> 04:51.592
Like on your anonymous tip line?

04:51.659 --> 04:52.726
We couldn't check out your story

04:52.793 --> 04:53.761
without talking to you
in person.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.596
-My story?
-I want to bring

04:55.663 --> 04:56.997
some technicians here.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.131
You won't find anything.

04:58.198 --> 04:59.333
I cleaned everything
with bleach,

04:59.400 --> 05:01.068
I burned my clothes
and my sheets.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.169
Why?

05:02.235 --> 05:03.837
Fire destroys DNA.

05:03.904 --> 05:04.972
I would like
to burn

05:05.038 --> 05:05.806
the whole apartment.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.275
Rena, I want to believe you,
but I need some proof.

05:08.342 --> 05:10.444
Find somebody else.

05:10.511 --> 05:13.246
What does that mean?

05:13.313 --> 05:15.449
He's done this before.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.786
And he'll do it again.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.501
Hey, Colby, do me a favor.
Just walk with me.

05:33.567 --> 05:34.802
Yeah, what's up?

05:34.868 --> 05:37.805
LAPD is sending over this
Internal Affairs detective,

05:37.871 --> 05:40.273
supposedly knows about,
uh, the dirty cops, so...

05:40.340 --> 05:42.576
Right, but we don't know
that it's a cop yet, right?

05:42.643 --> 05:44.177
I mean, it could have been
an impersonator,

05:44.244 --> 05:45.245
could be she was lying.

05:45.312 --> 05:47.715
The bartender said she was
toasted when she left the bar.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.550
The assistant director told me
to get ahead of the media on

05:49.617 --> 05:50.884
on this, so if IA can give us
some insight,

05:50.951 --> 05:52.219
I guess we should take it,
right?

05:52.285 --> 05:53.220
What do you got?

05:53.286 --> 05:54.722
Well, Rena Vining's record
is clean

05:54.788 --> 05:56.590
and as far as impersonators
go, we're checking

05:56.657 --> 05:58.559
costume houses,
uniform shops

05:58.626 --> 06:00.461
to see about sales
to civilians.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.895
-Anything on LAPD?
-They had

06:01.962 --> 06:04.064
no unmarked cars patrolling
the area at the time,

06:04.131 --> 06:06.199
but based on
descriptions,

06:06.266 --> 06:07.535
we've narrowed it down
from about

06:07.601 --> 06:10.804
9,000 LAPD cops to 551.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.272
WOMAN:
551 good officers.

06:12.339 --> 06:14.041
Ivy Kirk, IAD.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.043
I thought you were supposed
to tell us about the bad cops.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.311
There's bad cops
and then there's "rapos"--

06:18.378 --> 06:19.346
different animal.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.048
So you've made up your mind
already?

06:21.114 --> 06:23.617
I haven't made up my mind
about anything, including you,

06:23.684 --> 06:24.652
but I've worked
Sex Crimes

06:24.718 --> 06:27.154
for 17 years and I'll
tell you two things:

06:27.220 --> 06:29.890
lots of females cry wolf to
cover their own bad behavior

06:29.957 --> 06:32.225
and rapists are
failures in life.

06:32.292 --> 06:34.628
If she's telling the truth,
we're looking for a screw-up

06:34.695 --> 06:36.163
with access to a uniform.
I'd check guys fired

06:36.229 --> 06:38.398
from the police academy before
I go accusing decent cops.

06:38.466 --> 06:39.767
DON: Hey, this is,
uh, Megan Reeves.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.302
This is Ivy Kirk,
IA, LAPD.

06:42.369 --> 06:44.505
Tox screen found Rohypnol
in Rena Vining's bloodstream--

06:44.572 --> 06:45.506
roofies.

06:45.573 --> 06:46.840
So she was telling the truth.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.576
About being on drugs anyway.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.911
Uh, Rohypnol is
a classic rape drug.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.546
It's physically
incapacitating,

06:52.613 --> 06:54.114
precludes memory,
not exactly

06:54.181 --> 06:55.115
recreational.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.585
Maybe her drink was
laced at the bar.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.820
We still don't know
if she was raped.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.192
(laughter)

07:05.258 --> 07:07.795
Hey, so I'm not going
to make it to lunch after all.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.196
No, me neither.
I have a study date.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.664
I just wanted you to know
that Larry's going

07:10.731 --> 07:11.665
to spend the
weekend with us.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.567
Yeah, I gave up
my monastic cell

07:13.634 --> 07:15.068
to some visiting Tibetans.

07:15.135 --> 07:19.072
Well, Amita's apartment
is being tented for termites.

07:19.139 --> 07:19.940
She's staying over.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.775
Well, no, then,
I re-- I retract this.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.310
'Cause that-that's
too many people, isn't it?

07:23.376 --> 07:24.578
ALAN:
No! Nonsense!

07:24.645 --> 07:26.079
No, the easiest thing we do
is move over.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.748
There's plenty of room.
I'll see you tonight, okay?

07:27.815 --> 07:29.116
-But wait, I can...
-Okay?

07:29.182 --> 07:30.217
I can stay in the garage.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.720
Unnecessary. You're staying
in the solarium again.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.955
Well, actually,
I think I'd prefer the garage.

07:35.022 --> 07:36.824
It's more like
a hermitage.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.760
Do you see what you have here?

07:39.827 --> 07:40.694
Mm-hmm.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.429
It's a Venn diagram intersection
indicating

07:42.496 --> 07:44.565
suspects
who match the description

07:44.632 --> 07:46.233
and have had
a history of violence.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.135
But it's also an ancient
religious symbol.

07:48.201 --> 07:51.605
Of course,
maybe you know all this already.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.373
The Vesica Piscis.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.175
Now, this symbolizes
the meeting

07:55.242 --> 07:57.377
of heaven and earth.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.179
He always knows
the coolest things.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.715
Hello, sweet one.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.917
How was the rest of
your trip back east?

08:03.984 --> 08:04.718
It was great.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.053
And I recognize these

08:06.119 --> 08:07.387
from geometry.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.422
Ah, Venn diagrams.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.224
Illustrations used
in set theory,

08:11.291 --> 08:13.894
showing relationships
amongst groups of things.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.663
Although mathematicians
have deepened the analysis

08:15.729 --> 08:18.265
since you were in school
by adding dimensions.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.867
Imagine a dolphin.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.002
It's a mammal;
that's one set of information.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.103
It eats fish,

08:23.170 --> 08:26.506
an intersecting set represented
in two dimensions,

08:26.574 --> 08:28.275
but we can also analyze it

08:28.341 --> 08:31.378
in three or four dimensions
across time and space.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.781
When it swims with a school
of other dolphins,

08:33.847 --> 08:35.916
it belongs to that set
for a while.

08:35.983 --> 08:38.619
When it surfaces,
it belongs to the set of things

08:38.686 --> 08:40.754
in that space, in that time.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.890
Now, we represent

08:42.956 --> 08:45.893
each set of data with a shape
reflecting its value,

08:45.959 --> 08:47.761
-and then...
-LARRY: Create a smaller subset

08:47.828 --> 08:50.497
common to every set.

08:50.564 --> 08:51.932
Yeah, and I'm just now
adding the names

08:51.999 --> 08:53.166
of police academy dropouts.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.435
I'll have a more refined
suspect list for you soon.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.571
Actually, the victim feels
that the rapist

08:57.638 --> 08:58.906
has probably done this before

08:58.972 --> 09:00.708
and I would tend
to agree with her.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.844
This rape was not chaotic;
it was controlled;

09:03.911 --> 09:06.479
and that comes with repetition,

09:06.546 --> 09:08.315
but I don't have
any other victims.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.583
And rape is
a notoriously

09:09.650 --> 09:10.951
underreported crime, isn't it?

09:11.018 --> 09:13.320
MEGAN: And if the rapist
is a police officer,

09:13.386 --> 09:15.322
victims are much less likely
to come forward.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.659
You know,
there is a technique called...

09:18.726 --> 09:22.329
mm-hmm...
syndromic surveillance,

09:22.395 --> 09:24.197
which is used to uncover
infectious diseases

09:24.264 --> 09:27.935
by tracking upticks
of pharmaceutical orders.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.402
Perhaps I
could adapt it

09:29.469 --> 09:32.706
to track behavior associated
with sexual assault.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.074
Like emergency
room visits

09:34.141 --> 09:35.943
or morning after pills,
hotline calls.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.277
Right, it could
totally be

09:37.344 --> 09:38.946
a variable in my Venn scheme.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.280
It wouldn't yield
victim's names, though,

09:40.347 --> 09:41.281
but it could refine

09:41.348 --> 09:44.584
search areas and perhaps reveal
a hidden time trend.

09:44.652 --> 09:45.886
A chronology would be great.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.087
Just let me
get into it.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.156
I'm gonna call
a colleague of mine

09:49.222 --> 09:52.292
over at the Center
for Disease Control.

09:52.359 --> 09:55.495
So, is something else
bothering you about all this?

09:55.562 --> 09:58.098
Oh, I just don't like
rape cases.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.767
Oh, Megan.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.068
Oh, no, not me.

10:01.134 --> 10:04.738
Um, my college roommate
was assaulted,

10:04.805 --> 10:07.841
and... I watched her slip
into a depression,

10:07.908 --> 10:10.443
and this victim kind of
reminds me of her.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.579
Reminds me
that I failed my friend.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.047
How?

10:14.114 --> 10:16.449
I just didn't want
to be around her after the rape.

10:16.516 --> 10:17.417
You know, I treated her

10:17.484 --> 10:19.186
like she had something
that was contagious.

10:24.792 --> 10:25.859
I'm telling you, Eppes--

10:25.926 --> 10:28.228
a guy does not start raping
out of the blue.

10:28.295 --> 10:31.364
If he's a cop, he's going
to have some kind of record--

10:31.431 --> 10:32.700
overuse of force complaints,

10:32.766 --> 10:34.802
domestic violence,
demotion, something.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.469
Anything with uniforms?

10:36.536 --> 10:37.738
Nothing from the cop stores,

10:37.805 --> 10:40.240
but there are over 60
costume shops in L.A.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.242
servicing the film
and TV industry.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.978
It's going to be impossible
to track all those uniforms.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.681
Unmarked car could be anybody,
but the bubble light...

10:47.748 --> 10:49.549
Did she say what color it was?

10:49.616 --> 10:51.451
Yeah, I think
it's of a...

10:51.518 --> 10:52.786
Yeah, blue.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.054
LAPD's red.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.355
DON:
So, who uses blue?

10:55.422 --> 10:57.624
Fire department.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.659
Put up the police academy
flunk-outs.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.563
So, these are
all the guys

11:03.630 --> 11:05.232
that either dropped out
or were fired?

11:05.298 --> 11:07.634
Yeah, and that
still have uniforms.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.469
Malcolm Tucci.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.538
Tucci?

11:11.604 --> 11:13.506
IVY:
Hmm...

11:13.573 --> 11:15.175
Ex-volunteer
fireman.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.910
I thought I
remembered that.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.012
He's got a dishonorable
discharge from the Army

11:19.079 --> 11:20.047
for assaulting an officer.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.481
He's got a temper.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.450
Ex-Army, ex-fire
department,

11:23.516 --> 11:24.952
ex-police academy dropout.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.054
This guy has failed
at everything he tried.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.722
Well, let's put these
in front of Rena

11:28.789 --> 11:30.590
and see if she picks him, right?

11:30.657 --> 11:31.725
IVY:
All right.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.360
MEGAN:
The Rohypnol

11:33.426 --> 11:35.796
is still in her system,
affecting cognition.

11:35.863 --> 11:38.398
She should remember the guy's
face from before he drugged her.

11:38.465 --> 11:39.399
Theoretically,
but remember,

11:39.466 --> 11:41.101
she didn't want
to come forward at all?

11:41.168 --> 11:42.669
So, maybe we should just
go easy on her.

11:42.736 --> 11:45.705
Reeves, I've covered over 1,000
rape cases. How about you?

11:45.773 --> 11:48.308
Hi, Rena. How you doing?

11:48.375 --> 11:49.442
Oh, just dandy.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.544
You people clean up
the fingerprint dust,

11:51.611 --> 11:53.080
or is that up to me?

11:53.146 --> 11:55.415
Honey, do men ever clean
up after themselves?

11:55.482 --> 11:59.086
Sit down. We want you
to take a look at these.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.861
Um, my mind is still
kind of fuzzy. I...

12:07.928 --> 12:09.096
It's all right.
If you can't...

12:09.162 --> 12:11.431
You'll know him
when you see him.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.908
I'm sorry.
I-I don't know if I can...

12:20.974 --> 12:22.309
Trust yourself, Rena.

12:23.376 --> 12:26.646
Um... this could be him.

12:26.713 --> 12:29.049
We can't do anything
unless you're sure.

12:32.452 --> 12:33.520
I don't, um...

12:33.586 --> 12:34.988
You know what?
You really don't have to.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.190
Take your time.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.327
I think this is him.

12:40.393 --> 12:41.761
You think or you know?

12:45.933 --> 12:48.635
Um... this is him.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.871
Good job.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.940
Thank you.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.376
Sign and date the back
of the photo.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.481
Is it him?

13:13.793 --> 13:15.395
-No bubble light.
-DON: All right.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.899
Ivy, why don't you and, uh,
Billy go around back, huh?

13:18.966 --> 13:21.101
Tommy, come with me.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.403
He had a gun.

13:23.470 --> 13:26.806
Never took it out,
but I was aware of it.

13:26.874 --> 13:29.142
(voice breaking):
Said he did me a favor.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.511
Now I was going to do him one.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.046
(sniffles)

13:33.113 --> 13:35.515
I tried to speak...

13:35.582 --> 13:37.417
(groans)

13:37.484 --> 13:39.719
...but I couldn't
make any words come out.

13:39.786 --> 13:42.389
Do you remember any
identifying marks on his body?

13:44.992 --> 13:46.126
(knocking)

13:46.193 --> 13:48.862
DON: Malcolm Tucci?
FBI. Open up.

13:52.765 --> 13:55.002
My brain wasn't working right.

13:56.803 --> 13:59.072
I concentrated
on saying, "Stop."

13:59.139 --> 14:00.573
Over and over

14:00.640 --> 14:01.841
in my head: "Stop it."

14:01.909 --> 14:02.976
"Stop it."

14:03.043 --> 14:05.545
(sniffles)

14:05.612 --> 14:07.447
I never got it out.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.681
(knocking)

14:08.748 --> 14:10.483
DON:
FBI, Malcolm. Open up.

14:24.331 --> 14:25.332
Malcolm, this is the FBI.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.866
I want you to
take that gun

14:26.934 --> 14:28.568
and very carefully
put it down

14:28.635 --> 14:29.736
on the floor
to your right.

14:29.802 --> 14:31.371
MEGAN: What else do you remember
about him?

14:38.045 --> 14:39.379
Just shoot me.

14:39.446 --> 14:40.513
DON: Look, I don't want
to shoot you,

14:40.580 --> 14:42.115
but I will if you don't
do what I'm saying.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.917
Put the gun on the floor,
Malcolm.

14:45.485 --> 14:46.319
And if I don't?

14:46.386 --> 14:47.988
IVY:
Malcolm,

14:48.055 --> 14:50.123
be smart.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.392
Slide the gun on the floor,
nice and easy.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.295
Come on.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.265
Shoot me.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.200
What's got you down, Malcolm?

15:01.801 --> 15:02.735
Get on
the floor.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.271
(panting)

15:04.337 --> 15:05.672
Put your hands
behind your back.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.311
(siren whoops)

15:14.681 --> 15:16.950
(hazard lights clicking)

15:20.820 --> 15:22.689
Thank goodness.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.091
I was getting scared.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.526
I'm out of gas, and
my cell phone's dead.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.895
Well, why don't you step out
of the vehicle, ma'am?

15:28.962 --> 15:30.530
I'll give you a ride.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.310
Why did you have the gun?

15:43.376 --> 15:44.577
Every night I sit there trying

15:44.644 --> 15:46.646
to drink up the nerve
to shoot myself.

15:46.713 --> 15:47.714
Why is that?

15:47.780 --> 15:49.349
I scrubbed out of the Army.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.218
My old man's
a retired colonel.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.253
If I shot myself,
it'd be the first thing

15:53.320 --> 15:54.921
I ever did to make him proud.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.856
Where were you
Saturday night?

15:56.923 --> 15:59.459
-You know where I was.
-Do I?

15:59.526 --> 16:02.395
I got picked up for fighting
at Tweety's Bar on La Brea.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.063
Spent the night

16:03.130 --> 16:04.331
in the drunk tank.

16:04.397 --> 16:04.864
Damn it!

16:04.931 --> 16:06.199
All right, just hold on.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.867
I need the LAPD
arrest sheets

16:07.934 --> 16:09.202
for Saturday night.
Thanks.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.204
I thought
we had him.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.372
Yeah, now you're
going to have

16:12.439 --> 16:14.074
to force another false I.D.
out of our victim.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.808
I didn't force anything.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.345
Rena Vining just blew
her credibility.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.280
Just got a call
on another rape.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.815
This time
the guy was in a radio car.

16:22.882 --> 16:24.917
So, unless somebody's missing
a police car,

16:24.984 --> 16:26.753
that's not an impersonator.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.655
That's an
actual cop.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.095
So, 20-year-old
female, Josie Biggs,

16:35.162 --> 16:37.897
phoned the Rape Crisis Line,
and they called it in.

16:37.964 --> 16:39.099
She had car trouble?

16:39.166 --> 16:40.867
Yeah. She says a police car

16:40.933 --> 16:42.702
with flashing
lights pulled up,

16:42.769 --> 16:44.971
and an uniformed cop
offered her a ride.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.839
-He was on shift
in a marked car? -Yeah.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.007
Which narrows it
down considerably,

16:48.075 --> 16:49.576
so, I'm going
to call Charlie.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.311
What did you find out?

16:51.378 --> 16:52.845
He raped her
at her apartment.

16:52.912 --> 16:55.382
She wasn't drugged. He offered
her a bottle of water.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.717
She didn't take it.
They're bringing her now.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.319
How is she getting here?

16:59.386 --> 17:01.054
A uni's bringing her.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.590
You put a woman who was attacked
by a cop in a car with a cop?

17:03.656 --> 17:06.726
Nobody wants to get this guy
more than we do.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.328
That's not the point.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.599
(indistinct radio communication)

17:12.665 --> 17:14.267
Josie?

17:14.334 --> 17:15.802
My name is Megan Reeves.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.537
I'm with the FBI.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.173
I'm going to speak
to her alone.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.575
Did you go to
the hospital?

17:24.544 --> 17:26.879
Did they call
someone for you?

17:26.946 --> 17:29.782
My parents are flying in
tonight.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.218
That's good.

17:31.284 --> 17:32.752
Can you tell me
what happened?

17:32.819 --> 17:34.821
You pulled your car over here?

17:34.887 --> 17:38.225
I ran out of gas.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.362
And then the policeman came,
and I...

17:42.429 --> 17:45.064
I thought I would be okay.

17:45.132 --> 17:48.235
(sobbing)

17:49.102 --> 17:51.638
I'm sorry.

17:51.704 --> 17:54.107
(sobbing)

17:58.211 --> 18:00.247
LARRY:
Once or twice

18:00.313 --> 18:02.249
in a lifetime,
there are quests

18:02.315 --> 18:04.717
that require all
that we have to give and more.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.653
Now, I'm about
to embark on just such

18:06.719 --> 18:08.355
a quixotic adventure, and

18:08.421 --> 18:11.324
thinking about
who should be my Sancho Panza.

18:11.391 --> 18:16.529
I keep coming up
with but one name: yours.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.464
(laughs)

18:17.530 --> 18:19.466
Larry, what are you
talking about?

18:19.532 --> 18:21.401
I accepted
the D Zero team's offer

18:21.468 --> 18:23.069
to search for the Higgs boson,

18:23.136 --> 18:25.572
and I require
a computational partner.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.275
Are you kidding?

18:28.341 --> 18:30.243
I never josh about the Higgs.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.912
We will be examining
decay channels

18:32.979 --> 18:34.981
of millions of particles,

18:35.047 --> 18:37.617
all to be deciphered
like the-the

18:37.684 --> 18:38.651
Rosetta Stone.

18:38.718 --> 18:42.355
Amita, this is the work
of a lifetime.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.757
It would be an honor.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.393
Brilliant.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.595
Okay, I will talk
to, uh, Mildred

18:48.661 --> 18:50.663
about getting some
of your teaching load reduced.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.999
Okay. Oh, you know, Larry,
actually, um,

18:53.065 --> 18:55.235
I do have to talk to Charlie,

18:55.302 --> 18:56.736
'cause he and I
were planning

18:56.803 --> 18:58.271
on co-teaching a class.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.372
-Mm...
-You know, Larry,

18:59.439 --> 19:02.175
he always does your math
for you.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.876
Why not ask him?

19:03.943 --> 19:05.578
CHARLIE:
Hey, Amita?

19:05.645 --> 19:07.480
Hey, did you input the data yet?

19:07.547 --> 19:09.649
'Cause Don needs a suspect list
ASAP.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.451
You know what? I think
that's the first time

19:11.518 --> 19:13.820
in my life I've ever
used the word "ASAP."

19:13.886 --> 19:15.722
(laughs)
Anyway...

19:15.788 --> 19:17.690
What?

19:17.757 --> 19:19.192
No. Nothing.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.527
Um, yeah,
I'm almost

19:20.593 --> 19:22.094
finished with the data entry.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.296
Okay. You know, something's up

19:23.363 --> 19:24.664
with these Venns.
No, seriously.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.633
Like, I... I have allowed
for the greatest

19:26.699 --> 19:27.834
possible variation
in the data,

19:27.900 --> 19:30.136
and there's still
too little overlap.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.471
-ALAN: Hey. Greetings, all.
-Hey.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.206
Aah. Oh,
Charlie, again

19:33.273 --> 19:35.375
with the blackboards
in the living room?

19:35.442 --> 19:36.709
Well, Larry's sleeping
in the garage, so...

19:36.776 --> 19:37.744
-Yeah, but I can move.
-No.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.012
No, I've already inflated
the air mattress.

19:40.079 --> 19:41.113
No. Dad, it's fine.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.416
We're all going to work
in here together. It's okay.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.017
All right, as
long as you keep

19:45.084 --> 19:46.152
the dining room clear.

19:46.219 --> 19:47.420
I'm making
a roast.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.322
No, Alan, I-I don't...
I don't eat red meat.

19:49.389 --> 19:50.457
Yeah. Actually,
neither do I.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.824
No. I know, I know.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.961
I-I got sea bass
for the non-carnivores among us.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.496
-Ah, excellent.
-AMITA: Thanks.

19:56.563 --> 19:59.131
Well, we can concoct
a surf-and-turf feast.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.567
(laughs)

20:00.633 --> 20:01.968
Ah.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.441
Don, no semen was
recovered from Josie,

20:08.508 --> 20:10.710
but both girls tested
positive for gonorrhea,

20:10.777 --> 20:13.446
and they both say they didn't
have it before the rape,

20:13.513 --> 20:14.914
and I tend to believe them.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.250
So, what, you're thinking
he gave it to them?

20:17.317 --> 20:19.319
Yeah. He could have it
and not even know.

20:19.386 --> 20:20.853
I mean, why else
wouldn't you just

20:20.920 --> 20:22.355
-knock it out with antibiotics?
-Right.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.725
Okay, so, I've got a list here
of 12 officers.

20:25.792 --> 20:28.661
They meet all the criteria,
but confidence isn't high.

20:28.728 --> 20:29.896
-Why not?
-'Cause the data's

20:29.962 --> 20:32.164
remaining opaque, and that
gives me an uneasy feeling.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.300
So, what do you suggest?

20:33.366 --> 20:34.667
Tread carefully.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.103
You think we can get the girl in
to look at the pictures?

20:37.169 --> 20:38.305
MEGAN:
Her parents are trying

20:38.371 --> 20:39.539
to take her home to Montana.

20:39.606 --> 20:40.740
I can give it a try,

20:40.807 --> 20:42.208
but they're closing ranks
around her.

20:42.275 --> 20:43.343
Yeah, give it a shot.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.511
Meanwhile, let's bring them in,

20:44.577 --> 20:46.513
and we'll get warrants
for blood tests.

20:48.681 --> 20:52.485
Your radio went silent today
for 17 minutes

20:52.552 --> 20:53.986
in the Cahuenga Pass.

20:54.053 --> 20:55.187
Can you tell me why?

20:55.254 --> 20:56.489
I got something to eat.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.491
-Where?
-Chackbay Diner.

20:58.558 --> 20:59.692
You got a receipt?

20:59.759 --> 21:00.660
No.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.895
You made a traffic stop
on Lankershim--

21:02.962 --> 21:06.833
10:13-- then no other activity
till you went off shift.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.100
What were you doing?

21:08.167 --> 21:09.502
Patrolling.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.103
Just driving around?

21:11.170 --> 21:12.505
It was peaceful.

21:12.572 --> 21:15.274
Not for Josie Biggs.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.409
This is crap.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.244
DON:
Yeah? Look, you were in the area

21:18.311 --> 21:20.380
of both rapes;
you fit the description;

21:20.447 --> 21:21.781
you can't account
for your time.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.015
I mean, Officer,
what would you think?

21:23.082 --> 21:25.818
Some chippy's making
false accusations

21:25.885 --> 21:28.020
'cause she's pissed
for getting a speeding ticket,

21:28.087 --> 21:29.922
or she slept around
and her boyfriend found out

21:29.989 --> 21:31.658
-All right,
-so she cries rape.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.793
I want to know where were you
when your radio went silent?

21:33.860 --> 21:37.029
I'm looking for a
rapist, all right?

21:37.096 --> 21:39.666
I'm not here to give cops
a hard time.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.435
I was asleep, okay?

21:42.502 --> 21:45.538
I pulled under
the 405 overpass,

21:45.605 --> 21:46.773
and caught a few z's.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.376
-(knocking on glass)
-All right, just relax.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.711
Sit down.
Don't go anywhere.

21:53.580 --> 21:55.382
The results
of the blood tests are in.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.016
All right.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.553
One guy tested positive.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.522
Just because a guy has a
sexually transmitted disease

22:02.589 --> 22:03.856
does not make
him a rapist.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.025
-It's all circumstantial.
-DON: Which guy?

22:06.092 --> 22:07.627
MEGAN:
Arnold Owens.

22:08.461 --> 22:09.562
We need a lineup.

22:09.629 --> 22:10.997
I don't know if I can get
Josie Biggs to come in.

22:11.063 --> 22:11.831
Maybe Rena Vining.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.833
Vining's no good.
She whiffed the last time.

22:13.900 --> 22:16.302
DON: Let's just see if we
can get Josie to come in

22:16.369 --> 22:17.637
with her parents then,
all right?

22:21.541 --> 22:23.610
COLBY:
All right, Owens.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.412
Let's go. You know the drill:

22:25.478 --> 22:27.179
stand there, say nothing
unless instructed.

22:27.246 --> 22:28.615
Why I gotta be in a lineup?

22:28.681 --> 22:29.716
I didn't do anything.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.283
So what if I got the clap?

22:31.350 --> 22:33.085
Just shut up and do it.

22:33.152 --> 22:34.253
OWENS:
Oh, great.

22:34.320 --> 22:35.888
So you're going going to treat
me like a rapist now, Butler?

22:35.955 --> 22:36.889
Is that it?

22:36.956 --> 22:38.324
See what you did?

22:38.391 --> 22:39.626
Just be cool, man, all right?

22:39.692 --> 22:41.961
If you didn't do it,
you got nothing to worry about.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.329
Like innocent guys
never go down,

22:43.396 --> 22:44.597
is that what you're saying?

22:44.664 --> 22:46.132
All right, that's it. Let's go.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.238
MEGAN:
Thank you for coming.

22:52.304 --> 22:54.741
We're going to make this
as painless as possible.

22:54.807 --> 22:57.009
Nothing is painless
about this, Agent Reeves.

22:57.076 --> 22:59.045
Uh, we'll wait out here
in the hallway.

22:59.111 --> 23:01.581
Yeah, you best not let me
lay eyes on this guy.

23:01.648 --> 23:04.917
And they won't be able
to see you,

23:04.984 --> 23:05.852
all right?

23:05.918 --> 23:07.219
So, all you have to do
is tell me

23:07.286 --> 23:10.256
if you recognize the man
who attacked you and that's it.

23:10.322 --> 23:12.859
Then you'll all be out of here
in less than five minutes.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.936
Hi, Josie.

23:24.003 --> 23:28.140
Okay, so just take your time,
sweetie, all right?

23:28.207 --> 23:30.877
I mean, as I said, you have
nothing to worry about.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.112
They can't
see you, so...

23:44.123 --> 23:47.126
He's not there.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.496
Where is he?
I thought you said you had him.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.363
Are you sure?

23:51.430 --> 23:53.132
She said it's
none of them.

23:53.199 --> 23:54.433
This is wrong.
Something's wrong.

23:54.501 --> 23:55.935
What? What's wrong?

23:56.002 --> 23:57.203
The uniform.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.771
IVY:
What? What, Josie?

23:58.838 --> 24:01.508
He had a patch on his arm.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.242
The man who...

24:03.309 --> 24:04.611
Who assaulted you.

24:04.677 --> 24:05.812
Where's my mom?

24:05.878 --> 24:07.413
Can I see my mom, please?

24:07.480 --> 24:08.881
Yeah, okay,
just what kind of patch?

24:08.948 --> 24:09.816
A bell.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.250
Wait, wait, all
right, Josie...

24:11.317 --> 24:12.585
Josie, hold on.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.621
Stay away from us.

24:14.687 --> 24:17.056
MEGAN:
Mr. Biggs, wait...

24:19.258 --> 24:23.630
You've been investigating
the wrong police department.

24:31.971 --> 24:32.905
MEGAN:
Colina Police Department.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.507
It's a town
of like 60,000,

24:34.574 --> 24:36.676
15 miles east of downtown,
still in L.A. County.

24:36.743 --> 24:38.344
DON: Right. So, what,
he comes here because

24:38.410 --> 24:41.013
he knows the LAPD uniforms
look pretty much the same?

24:41.080 --> 24:43.349
And he gets mixed in with 9,000
other suspects-- sly boy.

24:43.415 --> 24:44.817
What, so now you're thinking
it is a cop?

24:44.884 --> 24:46.753
Look, Eppes,
my gut told me

24:46.819 --> 24:50.089
it wasn't any of my men;
my gut was right.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.658
Uh-huh.

24:51.724 --> 24:53.793
How are we doing getting Josie
to look at the pictures?

24:53.860 --> 24:54.861
Gone.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.495
Her father says
they're putting this behind them

24:56.563 --> 24:58.264
and pretending like
it never happened.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.331
Easy for them to say.

24:59.398 --> 25:00.366
Yeah.

25:00.432 --> 25:01.367
And where's Colby?

25:01.433 --> 25:03.135
He's gone to Colina PD
to do interviews.

25:03.202 --> 25:04.170
I can help with that.

25:04.236 --> 25:05.204
Ah, that's all right.

25:05.271 --> 25:06.806
Look, Eppes,

25:06.873 --> 25:09.075
I grew up in a small
department like Colina.

25:09.141 --> 25:11.578
I know all about how the
good old boys close ranks.

25:11.644 --> 25:12.845
Let me help you.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.984
All right.

25:18.050 --> 25:19.185
I'll find the local
rape crisis line,

25:19.251 --> 25:20.687
see if I can find
some new victims.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.655
I can't believe
we have to start all over.

25:22.722 --> 25:23.823
We don't.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.324
I talked to the L.A. County
Health Department.

25:25.391 --> 25:26.358
Both Rena and Josie

25:26.425 --> 25:30.329
have contracted an unusual
strain of gonorrhea:

25:30.396 --> 25:33.666
quinolone-resistant
Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

25:33.733 --> 25:34.967
A drug-resistant strain.

25:35.034 --> 25:38.605
Now, there is one class
of antibiotic left

25:38.671 --> 25:40.940
to defeat superbugs,
but only one,

25:41.007 --> 25:43.242
and doctors try really hard
not to use it.

25:43.309 --> 25:45.011
MEGAN:
Okay, so...

25:45.077 --> 25:46.946
So, gonorrhea
is a reportable STD.

25:47.013 --> 25:48.881
Now, based on public
health data,

25:48.948 --> 25:50.650
I can construct
a sexual networking model

25:50.717 --> 25:51.851
for the city of Colina

25:51.918 --> 25:55.421
and map infections back
through multiple sexual partners

25:55.487 --> 25:56.956
to find the source.

25:57.023 --> 25:58.858
It's like any other
networking model--

25:58.925 --> 26:00.492
a family tree, a facebook,
nerve endings--

26:00.559 --> 26:03.696
where each connection transmits
data, a nerve impulse.

26:03.763 --> 26:05.231
For example, a hand waving.

26:05.297 --> 26:06.733
We notice the effect

26:06.799 --> 26:08.968
and map the connection
back to the source.

26:09.035 --> 26:12.104
Now, in this case,
the hand waving represents

26:12.171 --> 26:14.073
a person coming in
for treatment,

26:14.140 --> 26:16.843
usually a woman, as the symptoms
are more immediate.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.310
Okay, so, what?
How does this help?

26:18.377 --> 26:19.912
With most people,
they go in for treatment

26:19.979 --> 26:21.147
and they don't come back.

26:21.213 --> 26:23.850
We're looking for the ones
who keep coming back

26:23.916 --> 26:25.251
because the treatment
doesn't work.

26:25.317 --> 26:28.254
We would then suspect
the drug-resistant strain.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.122
So we would question the
people in that network

26:30.189 --> 26:32.892
until we found a connection
to Colina PD?

26:32.959 --> 26:34.326
COLBY:
At the time of the last rape,

26:34.393 --> 26:36.863
you had 11 officers on duty,
five who fit the profile.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.898
My men will answer
questions for ten minutes.

26:38.965 --> 26:40.867
You will not have access
to them beyond that,

26:40.933 --> 26:42.735
and I will not allow
their blood to be tested

26:42.802 --> 26:44.403
without a court order,
is that clear?

26:44.470 --> 26:47.173
A court order's
not a problem.

26:47.239 --> 26:50.643
Chief, I just went through this
with my men in L.A.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.344
And now you know
they're innocent, correct?

26:52.411 --> 26:54.747
As are my men.

26:54.814 --> 26:57.083
We've gotten calls
for over a year

26:57.149 --> 26:59.018
about women being
raped by a policeman.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.320
They were too terrified
to give their names.

27:01.387 --> 27:02.488
How many calls?

27:02.554 --> 27:03.656
Six or seven.

27:03.723 --> 27:05.057
Did you report them?

27:05.124 --> 27:07.026
Until I was blue
in the face.

27:07.093 --> 27:10.196
Colina PD has ignored me
and no longer takes my calls.

27:10.262 --> 27:12.598
The Sheriff's Department says
they don't have enough to go on.

27:12.665 --> 27:16.803
I'm going to need the exact
dates and times of the calls.

27:16.869 --> 27:19.238
I have it right here.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.640
I've been waiting
for someone to listen.

27:21.708 --> 27:23.910
So, seven rapes
in the last year,

27:23.976 --> 27:26.245
and two in the last week.

27:27.747 --> 27:30.182
CHARLIE:
Okay, so, Patient 07-649F

27:30.249 --> 27:32.318
returned to the clinic
on what date?

27:32.384 --> 27:33.285
September 9.

27:33.352 --> 27:36.188
It was her third visit
after two tries with Cipro.

27:36.255 --> 27:39.992
Seems Patient 07-649F has
the drug-resistant variety.

27:40.059 --> 27:41.260
She's listed
as a sex worker.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.796
I've always found that term
so odd.

27:43.863 --> 27:44.931
(chuckles)

27:44.997 --> 27:46.799
Alan, sorry, we've taken over
your living room.

27:46.866 --> 27:50.169
Hey, how about you beat me
at a game of chess?

27:50.236 --> 27:51.270
Where?

27:51.337 --> 27:53.272
The kitchen.

27:53.339 --> 27:55.274
-Sure.
-Why not?

27:55.341 --> 27:56.342
You know, Charlie,

27:56.408 --> 27:59.411
we should really be doing
this work in the office.

27:59.478 --> 28:01.347
Don't worry about him.
He likes having everyone around.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.115
Who's the next
return patient?

28:03.182 --> 28:06.252
Uh... 07-992F.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.721
October 1,
after three rounds of Cipro.

28:08.788 --> 28:12.424
And she's not listed
as a sex worker.

28:12.491 --> 28:13.726
Right.

28:13.793 --> 28:16.428
Uh... Charlie.

28:17.964 --> 28:21.801
Larry has asked me
to partner with him

28:21.868 --> 28:23.702
on the Higgs boson work.

28:23.770 --> 28:25.772
Really?

28:25.838 --> 28:28.040
That's awesome.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.575
That...

28:29.641 --> 28:30.843
Are you excited?

28:30.910 --> 28:33.279
Yes, I am.

28:33.345 --> 28:35.714
I mean, I've never done
anything like this.

28:35.782 --> 28:39.385
But it means that
I will have to lighten

28:39.451 --> 28:43.655
my teaching load,
and I won't be able to co-teach

28:43.722 --> 28:45.357
that course with you
this semester.

28:45.424 --> 28:46.725
Oh, I see, okay.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.828
Well, maybe I'll find another
really cute post-grad

28:48.895 --> 28:50.129
who can teach it with me.

28:50.196 --> 28:52.364
This must be strange for you.

28:52.431 --> 28:55.868
I know you've worked
with him before.

28:55.935 --> 28:57.904
You know, when I
did math for Larry,

28:57.970 --> 29:00.106
it was kind of
secondary for me.

29:00.172 --> 29:04.911
But the search for the Higgs
is so important to him,

29:04.977 --> 29:07.413
he needs a true collaborator
who has the time,

29:07.479 --> 29:10.716
and that's not me,
it's you.

29:10.783 --> 29:12.084
You have the perfect skills.

29:12.151 --> 29:16.622
It's a perfect time in your
life to do this project.

29:16.688 --> 29:19.558
It's not strange
for me at all.

29:19.625 --> 29:21.027
Don't lie.

29:21.093 --> 29:24.463
Okay, maybe it's a little
strange, but not much.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.465
I want the world for you.

29:28.334 --> 29:30.803
Thank you.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.338
(siren wailing)

29:32.404 --> 29:34.340
(gun clicking)

29:41.580 --> 29:43.015
(gunshot)

29:54.861 --> 29:57.763
(keypad beeps twice,
auto-dial beeps rapidly)

29:57.830 --> 29:59.866
(doorbell rings)

30:01.733 --> 30:04.003
Thank you
for coming.

30:04.904 --> 30:07.206
I'm privileged to be asked.

30:07.273 --> 30:09.208
I know I'm supposed
to talk to someone

30:09.275 --> 30:11.277
when I get this
involved in a case

30:11.343 --> 30:14.914
and there's... there's no one
better to talk to than you.

30:14.981 --> 30:16.315
Shall we make some tea?

30:16.382 --> 30:19.085
I-I hate this, Larry.
I hate it.

30:19.151 --> 30:22.621
I hate seeing their eyes,
the women, the fear.

30:22.688 --> 30:27.259
And the shame when
they didn't do anything wrong.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.962
I hate that nobody's
talking about this and that...

30:30.029 --> 30:31.998
this person is a cop...

30:32.064 --> 30:34.300
he's supposed to protect people.

30:34.366 --> 30:36.268
And I...

30:36.335 --> 30:41.007
keep imagining... situations

30:41.073 --> 30:45.177
where I have a legitimate reason
to kill him.

30:47.046 --> 30:50.682
The psyche plays out
these urges

30:50.749 --> 30:54.353
so we don't have to act
on them in reality.

30:57.256 --> 30:59.758
CHARLIE: ...use an algorithm
to narrow the field...

30:59.825 --> 31:01.127
-Hey.
-Hey.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.395
So, I narrowed the field down
to two women in Colina

31:03.462 --> 31:05.764
being treated
for drug-resistant gonorrhea:

31:05.831 --> 31:10.536
Patients 07-513F and 07-992F.

31:10.602 --> 31:11.603
Uh-huh, what about names?

31:11.670 --> 31:13.339
That took a little doing.

31:13.405 --> 31:15.607
I had to convinced my friend
at the Health Department

31:15.674 --> 31:17.409
to reveal the names.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.645
It's Virginia Mallard
and Oki Chigawa.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.447
Mallard?

31:21.513 --> 31:24.150
There's a Mallard
on the Colina PD,

31:24.216 --> 31:26.618
but he wasn't on duty
either night of the rape,

31:26.685 --> 31:28.620
and he doesn't fit the
description: he's black.

31:28.687 --> 31:29.956
What about the other one?

31:31.557 --> 31:32.758
Unmarried prostitute.

31:32.824 --> 31:34.060
She's in the system.

31:34.126 --> 31:35.627
All right, well,
I'll set up an interview.

31:35.694 --> 31:38.998
We'll bring in this Mallard guy
and see if we get something.

31:39.065 --> 31:42.134
MEGAN: Were you aware that the
rape crisis line in your town

31:42.201 --> 31:45.037
received seven calls
in the last year

31:45.104 --> 31:47.373
alleging rape by an
on-duty police officer?

31:47.439 --> 31:52.744
Yeah, we all heard,
some whackadoo feminist's

31:52.811 --> 31:54.313
got it in for us.

31:54.380 --> 31:55.514
Those first few
phone calls

31:55.581 --> 31:57.883
coincide with your schedule
pretty well, Bill.

31:57.950 --> 31:59.151
Yeah. You were on duty

31:59.218 --> 32:00.552
in the area
during the first

32:00.619 --> 32:04.456
five alleged rapes
by a cop in Colina.

32:04.523 --> 32:06.092
What do you have
to say about that?

32:06.158 --> 32:08.127
I got nothing to say about that.

32:09.996 --> 32:12.498
Has your wife been ill,
Officer Mallard?

32:12.564 --> 32:13.165
What?

32:13.232 --> 32:14.500
You see, the rape victims

32:14.566 --> 32:16.468
have this really unusual strain
of gonorrhea,

32:16.535 --> 32:18.037
-and your wife...
-Now hold on.

32:18.104 --> 32:19.071
Stop right there.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.173
Oh, did you contract
this disease

32:21.240 --> 32:23.709
while raping someone
and then pass it on

32:23.775 --> 32:24.977
to your unfortunate wife?

32:25.044 --> 32:26.078
I didn't rape anybody.

32:26.145 --> 32:27.980
So your wife
was sleeping around, huh?

32:28.047 --> 32:29.081
That's how she got the clap?

32:29.148 --> 32:30.316
One more word

32:30.382 --> 32:32.084
about my wife,
I will leap across this table

32:32.151 --> 32:33.685
-and smack the crap
out of you... -Bill,

32:33.752 --> 32:36.255
you gave your wife
a drug-resistant strain

32:36.322 --> 32:37.990
of gonorrhea
that she'll be dealing with

32:38.057 --> 32:39.158
for the rest
of her life.

32:39.225 --> 32:40.726
Where'd you get it from, huh?

32:40.792 --> 32:41.960
A hooker?

32:42.028 --> 32:43.895
We've been talking
to this one.

32:43.962 --> 32:46.265
-You think your name
is going to come up? -So what?

32:46.332 --> 32:49.235
We were getting some
from hookers.

32:49.301 --> 32:50.602
That's not rape.

32:50.669 --> 32:53.305
-Who's "we"?
-IVY: Bill...

32:53.372 --> 32:55.307
we know it wasn't you.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.943
We're looking
for a white guy.

32:58.010 --> 32:59.445
Just tell us
what you know.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.487
Who's his partner?

33:08.554 --> 33:09.855
Richard Wong.

33:09.921 --> 33:11.090
No good.

33:11.157 --> 33:13.359
Was he riding with the same guy

33:13.425 --> 33:14.826
when the first rapes
were reported?

33:14.893 --> 33:17.029
That's a good question.

33:19.431 --> 33:22.168
You rape those first few
women together, Bill?

33:22.234 --> 33:23.735
We're going
to get him,

33:23.802 --> 33:25.737
you know, between
the victims,

33:25.804 --> 33:27.273
and the witnesses
and the semen.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.608
So you should decide if you want
to go down together.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.779
I tried to stop him.
You got to believe me.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.614
Who?

33:37.749 --> 33:39.085
Cleary.

33:39.151 --> 33:42.388
He got violent with
the hookers and...

33:42.454 --> 33:47.793
next thing I know he's branching
out to regular women...

33:47.859 --> 33:51.397
which was when I asked
for a new partner.

33:54.032 --> 33:54.966
How many women
you think were raped

33:55.033 --> 33:57.203
'cause you didn't have the spine
to turn in a bad cop?

33:57.269 --> 33:58.770
I tried to talk him out of it.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.308
Cleary's just gone
off shift.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.042
Colby's headed
to his residence.

34:04.110 --> 34:06.245
Let's go.

34:17.356 --> 34:19.525
-Blaine Cleary!
-FBI!

34:23.595 --> 34:26.298
Clear.

34:27.599 --> 34:28.834
Clear.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.204
Clear.

34:33.939 --> 34:35.006
No vehicle
in the garage.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.542
I don't think he's been here

34:36.608 --> 34:38.710
since he got off shift
at midnight.

34:38.777 --> 34:41.580
He's out trawling
for another victim.

34:41.647 --> 34:43.582
Could be anywhere.

34:52.224 --> 34:55.927
(indistinct radio communication)

34:55.994 --> 34:57.129
There's still no sign of him.

34:57.196 --> 34:59.531
All right, look, we'll call you
if we get anything, all right?

34:59.598 --> 35:01.567
-You got this wrong.
-Yeah, if he's such a great cop,

35:01.633 --> 35:03.034
and he has so
many arrests,

35:03.101 --> 35:04.770
why was he demoted
three months ago?

35:04.836 --> 35:05.704
It was not a demotion.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.373
You put a super-cop
in the motor pool

35:07.439 --> 35:08.540
to unclog carburetors?

35:08.607 --> 35:10.176
I mean, what was it,
some kind of abuse

35:10.242 --> 35:11.643
or sexual harassment,
is that it?

35:11.710 --> 35:13.212
You don't want to find
yourself covering

35:13.279 --> 35:14.480
for a rapist now, do you?

35:14.546 --> 35:16.014
That's why the schedules
don't match.

35:16.081 --> 35:18.617
That's why there's
different vehicles.

35:18.684 --> 35:20.152
At the end
of his shifts,

35:20.219 --> 35:21.520
he took cars
from the motor pool

35:21.587 --> 35:23.121
without signing
them out.

35:23.189 --> 35:24.856
You got GPSes
in your cars, right?

35:24.923 --> 35:26.625
Yeah.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.126
All right, let's see
if anything's missing.

35:28.194 --> 35:29.228
Why don't you head out

35:29.295 --> 35:30.262
to where the last
two attacks happened,

35:30.329 --> 35:32.097
then we'll call you if we get
any coordinates, all right?

35:32.164 --> 35:33.432
And call Colby.

35:33.499 --> 35:34.733
Got it.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.869
MEGAN:
7.7424,

35:37.936 --> 35:40.138
West 118 degrees,

35:40.206 --> 35:42.441
20.80614.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.143
Got it.

35:45.211 --> 35:46.745
It's an unmarked dark Crown Vic.

35:46.812 --> 35:49.215
(beeping)

35:49.281 --> 35:50.282
He's back
in LAPD territory.

35:50.349 --> 35:53.285
Don, we'll meet you there.

35:53.352 --> 35:56.021
MAN: It's all right, ma'am.
I'll give you a ride home.

35:56.087 --> 35:58.156
That'd be cool.

35:58.224 --> 35:59.891
-You all right?
-Yeah.

36:03.362 --> 36:06.097
4257 Oakwood in Burbank?

36:06.164 --> 36:07.899
You're not going
to arrest me, right?

36:07.966 --> 36:09.701
No, doing you a favor.

36:09.768 --> 36:11.837
Why don't you drink some water.
You'll feel better.

36:11.903 --> 36:14.306
Thanks, but what about my car?

36:14.373 --> 36:16.942
I gotta go to work
in the morning.

36:25.251 --> 36:26.452
What's happening?

36:29.355 --> 36:31.257
(tires screeching)

36:32.958 --> 36:36.795
(siren blaring)

36:36.862 --> 36:38.430
What are you doing?

36:46.938 --> 36:48.607
We're chasing Cleary

36:48.674 --> 36:50.742
on Acton
towards Bishop Road.

36:50.809 --> 36:52.411
He's got a woman in the car.

36:52.478 --> 36:54.313
All right, look, I'm going
to try heading him

36:54.380 --> 36:56.214
away from the freeway then.

37:05.857 --> 37:08.059
Oh, God!
Here we go...

37:08.126 --> 37:09.261
(tires screeching)

37:35.587 --> 37:36.688
Whoa, what do you think?

37:36.755 --> 37:37.789
Where's he going?
Where's he going?

37:37.856 --> 37:39.658
He's gotta know
we got him on GPS.

37:39.725 --> 37:41.460
Don, he's gonna ditch.

37:48.734 --> 37:50.702
-Where's Colby?
-He's on his way.

38:00.946 --> 38:04.015
(tires screeching,
engine roaring)

38:14.426 --> 38:15.694
Put the weapon down.

38:16.595 --> 38:18.430
COLBY:
Put it down.

38:20.332 --> 38:21.800
DON: Cleary, it's over.
Drop it.

38:29.941 --> 38:30.876
IVY:
Are you okay?

38:30.942 --> 38:32.043
-Yeah.
-Okay.

38:32.110 --> 38:33.278
Come on.

38:33.345 --> 38:34.413
-All right, you all right?
-Okay.

38:34.480 --> 38:35.681
I got her!
I got her! Go!

38:39.718 --> 38:40.952
Freeze!

38:46.224 --> 38:47.393
Drop your weapon!

38:47.459 --> 38:48.860
(screams)

38:48.927 --> 38:51.329
What if I don't?

38:55.501 --> 38:56.402
You better do it.

39:00.138 --> 39:02.240
It's just sex, guys.

39:02.307 --> 39:03.975
-Not that big a deal.
-Yeah.

39:04.042 --> 39:05.844
See if you feel any
differently about it

39:05.911 --> 39:07.446
when you're someone's
cell block bitch.

39:08.079 --> 39:09.748
Let's go.

39:09.815 --> 39:12.083
-You all right?
-Yeah.

39:12.150 --> 39:14.653
Whew! Nice.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.087
Thanks.

39:25.531 --> 39:27.499
(panting):
Yeah.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.370
You know, Charles,

39:32.438 --> 39:34.072
there's something
rather delicate

39:34.139 --> 39:35.874
I need to discuss
with you.

39:35.941 --> 39:39.110
I think it's an
inspired choice.

39:39.177 --> 39:40.579
Yeah, what is?

39:40.646 --> 39:42.881
Asking Amita to work with you
on the Higgs boson.

39:42.948 --> 39:44.015
You do?

39:45.116 --> 39:46.585
Maybe we should consider getting

39:46.652 --> 39:49.320
one of those new refrigerators
that uses less energy.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.756
Uh... "we"?

39:50.822 --> 39:52.891
I-I was just speaking
in general.

39:52.958 --> 39:54.626
I love that you
said "we."

39:54.693 --> 39:56.862
So how is the grand experiment
coming along?

39:56.928 --> 39:58.864
Well, the algorithm shows
that the best financial move

39:58.930 --> 40:01.199
would be my dad buys a condo
and Amita moves in here.

40:01.266 --> 40:04.335
But we're still working
on the emotional valuations,

40:04.402 --> 40:05.804
which are a little
less clear-cut.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.405
Could deliver a
different outcome.

40:07.473 --> 40:10.408
Translation:
Charlie's not ready.

40:10.476 --> 40:12.410
(chuckling):
No.

40:12.478 --> 40:14.913
I just need to readjust
the math.

40:14.980 --> 40:17.282
Take another look.

40:17.348 --> 40:18.817
Ah, the timeless dilemma--

40:18.884 --> 40:21.119
how to coerce logic
to suit feelings.

40:21.186 --> 40:22.654
Well, nobody's in a rush.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.456
Where's Alan?

40:24.523 --> 40:26.157
Dad?

40:26.224 --> 40:27.358
Breakfast.

40:27.425 --> 40:31.497
Donnie, coffee.

40:31.563 --> 40:33.499
Aren't you suppose
to be getting up?

40:33.565 --> 40:35.133
What are you doing?

40:35.200 --> 40:36.468
It's my day
to sleep late.

40:36.535 --> 40:38.504
Oh, ow, eh. Sorry.

40:38.570 --> 40:39.638
This is ridiculous.

40:39.705 --> 40:41.406
Look, you got to sleep
in your own place, all right?

40:41.473 --> 40:42.508
Yeah, but they were having

40:42.574 --> 40:44.543
an all-night math-a-thon
in the living room.

40:44.610 --> 40:47.746
* That's where I'm heading for *

40:49.548 --> 40:53.719
* Hold onto a sinking stone *

40:55.587 --> 40:57.956
* Until the worst is known... *

40:58.023 --> 40:59.958
That's him.

41:00.025 --> 41:01.760
I remember his eyes.

41:01.827 --> 41:03.962
We have him in custody.

41:05.163 --> 41:07.398
Will you testify?

41:07.465 --> 41:09.901
Well, just think about it.

41:09.968 --> 41:12.671
I have to move on,
forget about it.

41:12.738 --> 41:17.075
* Nobody protects you... *

41:17.142 --> 41:19.310
I had a friend in college
who was raped

41:19.377 --> 41:20.579
and she felt
the same way.

41:20.646 --> 41:22.581
She was just going
to tough it out,

41:22.648 --> 41:25.651
and, uh, her body
wouldn't let her.

41:25.717 --> 41:27.653
She started to have
flashbacks and...

41:27.719 --> 41:29.721
she was too smart
for therapy, so...

41:29.788 --> 41:32.190
she kind of fell into drugs.

41:32.257 --> 41:34.359
What happened to her?

41:34.425 --> 41:37.228
Someone, a much better friend
than I was, got her some help,

41:37.295 --> 41:39.464
but it... it took years.

41:39.531 --> 41:41.166
* Nobody wants to... *

41:41.232 --> 41:43.234
I have some

41:43.301 --> 41:44.636
names of some people

41:44.703 --> 41:46.304
that could help you.

41:46.371 --> 41:48.640
They're good people and they'll
know what you've been through.

41:48.707 --> 41:50.375
* Talk about it *

41:50.441 --> 41:55.046
* No one protects you *

41:55.113 --> 41:59.117
* Yeah... *

42:00.886 --> 42:02.554
You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

42:02.621 --> 42:05.557
I used to think it was strange

42:05.624 --> 42:07.793
when people called rape
"soul murder."

42:09.628 --> 42:11.462
Do you think
my soul has been murdered?

42:11.529 --> 42:13.331
No. I think
you've been hurt

42:13.398 --> 42:14.833
and you need
some help.

42:14.900 --> 42:16.201
I don't think you could handle
this on your own

42:16.267 --> 42:18.804
any more than you could remove
a bullet from your body.

42:20.138 --> 42:21.372
And you could

42:21.439 --> 42:23.775
testify or not, but...

42:23.842 --> 42:26.111
you got to start
to think about

42:26.177 --> 42:29.247
what's going to work
for you for the long haul.

42:29.314 --> 42:32.984
And please don't be
too proud to ask for help.

42:34.753 --> 42:38.189
* Nobody wants to *

42:38.256 --> 42:39.858
* Think about it *

42:39.925 --> 42:43.328
* Nobody wants to *

42:43.394 --> 42:45.563
* Talk about it *

42:45.631 --> 42:52.337
* Nobody wants to. *
