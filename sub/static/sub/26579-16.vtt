00:08.663 --> 00:09.757
He's clean.

00:09.788 --> 00:10.859
See?

00:10.945 --> 00:12.921
Just out for a stroll.
A stroll?

00:13.165 --> 00:15.808
It is sad the way you guys
are harassing an innocent man.

00:15.894 --> 00:18.047
Officer Nolan, are you familiar
with the Crack Almanac?

00:18.132 --> 00:20.180
- Is it available on Kindle?
- Four basic principles...

00:20.265 --> 00:22.300
Look Out, Cook Out,
Cash Out, Stash Out.

00:22.386 --> 00:24.301
Cook out...
cook cocaine into crack.

00:24.387 --> 00:25.960
- Look out...
- For the cops.

00:26.257 --> 00:27.594
You really could stand
to work on that one.

00:27.679 --> 00:28.701
Stash out.

00:28.786 --> 00:29.969
You want to stash
the rocks nearby

00:30.054 --> 00:31.601
so if the cops catch you,
you're clean.

00:31.718 --> 00:34.621

00:34.706 --> 00:36.273

00:56.900 --> 00:58.034

just out for a stroll.

00:58.119 --> 01:01.564
Ah, but there is still one
principle left, Officer Nolan...

01:01.650 --> 01:03.065
Cash out.

01:03.151 --> 01:04.212
See,
a real good hustler

01:04.283 --> 01:06.923
only wants to be seen
on his corner doing business,

01:07.025 --> 01:10.595
which means if D'Andre is here,
so is his money.

Yo, I need a break.

01:52.638 --> 01:54.056
I can't believe
we don't get

01:54.142 --> 01:55.665
a single vacation
or personal day

01:55.751 --> 01:57.260
during our entire
probationary year.

01:57.361 --> 01:58.775
It's how we prove
our commitment.

01:58.861 --> 02:01.095
Wearing wool in August
isn't enough?

02:01.591 --> 02:02.718
Why are you so cheery?

02:02.804 --> 02:04.033
I'm just livin'
my best life.

02:04.119 --> 02:05.181
Oh.

02:05.267 --> 02:06.501
- Jessica.
- Jessica.

02:07.165 --> 02:08.336
No.

02:08.454 --> 02:09.539
Yeah, okay, a little.

02:09.626 --> 02:11.228
- Yes, yes, yeah, a little.
- Yeah.

02:11.392 --> 02:13.494
That's great.
You... You seem really happy.

02:13.580 --> 02:15.196
- Thank you.
- Oh, we should do a double date.

02:15.281 --> 02:16.379
I'd love for you
to meet Gino.

02:16.464 --> 02:18.219
Sounds great, but she's
out of town right now.

02:18.304 --> 02:19.299
She's, uh, doing a lecture

02:19.384 --> 02:20.839
at the Department
of Homeland Security.

02:20.924 --> 02:22.376
Can I have your attention?

02:22.462 --> 02:23.603
Let's go, Boots.

02:23.689 --> 02:25.572
Everyone, gather up.

02:27.704 --> 02:29.603
All right, guys, listen up.

02:30.165 --> 02:31.879
Internal Affairs
will be conducting

02:31.964 --> 02:33.572
random integrity tests
this week.

02:33.665 --> 02:35.670
Reversals.
That's right, Officer West.

02:35.764 --> 02:37.089
What's a reversal?

02:37.174 --> 02:39.299
Where cops go undercover
to rat out other cops.

02:39.384 --> 02:41.228
IA officers will be
spending the week

02:41.314 --> 02:42.629
pretending to be criminals

02:42.714 --> 02:44.392
so they can analyze
how we treat them.

02:44.478 --> 02:45.933
So, what Tim said.

02:46.470 --> 02:49.879
Do you think this is a joke,
Officer Lopez? Officer Bradford?

02:49.964 --> 02:51.299
- No, ma'am.
- No, ma'am.

02:51.384 --> 02:53.462
Good.
'Cause I take it very seriously.

02:53.572 --> 02:54.916
If you have to change
your behavior

02:55.001 --> 02:57.706
because of these reversals,
we have a problem.

02:57.797 --> 03:01.042
My officers do things
the right way... every day.

03:01.214 --> 03:02.329
Is that understood?

03:02.415 --> 03:03.589
Yes, ma'am.

03:03.674 --> 03:05.009
Dismissed.

03:05.094 --> 03:06.969
Are reversals
really that hard to spot?

03:07.054 --> 03:09.697
I mean, you can usually
make a cop by the way they walk.

03:09.783 --> 03:11.548
Not these guys.
They train for this.

03:11.634 --> 03:13.129
It's like the Super Bowl
to them.

03:13.214 --> 03:14.299
They go all-in.

03:14.384 --> 03:15.839
About two years ago,
they took over a bank

03:15.924 --> 03:18.679
and masqueraded as robbers
just to test our response time.

03:18.764 --> 03:19.879
They cleared
the bank out first.

03:19.964 --> 03:21.589
Every teller and customer
was a plant.

03:21.674 --> 03:22.719
That's dedicated.

03:22.804 --> 03:24.339
No, it's a waste of time
and resources,

03:24.424 --> 03:26.799
which is why I make it my mission
to seek and destroy reversals.

03:26.884 --> 03:28.129
I don't see
what the fuss is about.

03:28.214 --> 03:30.179
A cop should be held
to the highest standards.

03:30.264 --> 03:32.719
Of course you side with IA.
Your dad's in charge.

03:32.804 --> 03:34.839
Okay, it's not about my dad.
The integrity of a co...

03:34.924 --> 03:37.299
- Hey.
- Morning.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.629
Here to see a client?

03:38.845 --> 03:40.464
Yeah.

03:41.354 --> 03:42.694
I won't keep you.

03:45.214 --> 03:47.001
Did... Did you guys
break up?

03:48.476 --> 03:51.101
No. We had... a few dates.
Then we stopped.

03:51.187 --> 03:52.908
Sounds like
a breakup to me.

03:53.146 --> 03:54.468
- What happened?
- Nothing.

03:54.554 --> 03:56.179
- It's fine. Let's go.
- Okay.

03:56.264 --> 03:59.589
<i>7-Adam-15, disturbance
at the Altobello Hotel.</i>

04:01.421 --> 04:02.457
You're saying
this is my fault?

04:02.542 --> 04:03.799
You're damn right
it's your fault!

04:03.884 --> 04:05.509
Do you have any idea
how much my car costs?

04:05.594 --> 04:07.379
Please, ma'am.
If we could take this inside...

04:07.464 --> 04:10.469
What seems to be the problem here?
Valet destroyed my car.

04:10.735 --> 04:12.507
- That car?
- Yeah, look, the paint job.

04:12.593 --> 04:13.633
Right there.

04:14.764 --> 04:16.129
That scratch
will buff right out.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.379
- You're lying. He's lying!
- This is a civil matter.

04:18.464 --> 04:19.565
Feel free
to take photographs

04:19.649 --> 04:20.759
and send it in
for an insurance claim.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.089
You mean you're not
gonna arrest him?

04:22.174 --> 04:23.339
There's no crime here,
ma'am.

04:23.424 --> 04:24.469
Oh, like hell there isn't.

04:24.554 --> 04:26.129
I know you did it
on purpose, too!

04:26.214 --> 04:27.469
'Cause I caught you
starting at my ass

04:27.554 --> 04:28.884
when I gave you the car.

04:28.970 --> 04:30.533
I see nicer asses
on the regular.

04:31.884 --> 04:33.549
No! Let go!

04:34.359 --> 04:35.734
- Oh!
- Drop that knife!

04:35.820 --> 04:36.859
- Oh!
- Let go of me!

04:36.945 --> 04:38.049
I'm sorry.
Sorry about that.

04:38.134 --> 04:39.304
Whoa. Sorry about that.

04:39.390 --> 04:40.633
I didn't mean
for that to happen.

04:40.718 --> 04:41.723
Yeah, right.

04:41.875 --> 04:43.250
Is that how you get off?

04:43.336 --> 04:45.617
You handcuff hot girls
and rip off their clothes?!

04:45.703 --> 04:46.703
No, ma'am.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.188
I'm just saying,
cops don't have

04:49.274 --> 04:50.729
the best reputation
right now.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.839
And if these tests
help the public trust us,

04:52.924 --> 04:54.132
isn't it worth it?

04:54.218 --> 04:55.945
And how are we supposed
to trust each other

04:56.031 --> 04:57.040
if our fellow officers
are trying

04:57.125 --> 04:58.789
to trick us
into screwing up?

04:59.055 --> 05:01.566
I... ask myself that
every day.

05:02.246 --> 05:03.307
That's different.

05:03.418 --> 05:04.883
I do it
to make you a better cop,

05:05.000 --> 05:06.241
not betray you.

It's always nice

05:47.054 --> 05:48.593
Uh, Officer,
is there any way

05:48.679 --> 05:50.757
you could let me slide
on this one,

05:50.843 --> 05:53.339
or just let me off with a...
with a stern warning?

05:53.424 --> 05:54.799
It's just that I'm
really late right now,

05:54.884 --> 05:56.339
and I got a lot of people
waiting for me on set.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.476
You ran a stop sign.
We could arrest you for it.

05:58.562 --> 05:59.567
Arrest me?

05:59.686 --> 06:01.468
Come on. It's...
It's a nice, quiet street.

06:01.554 --> 06:02.843
There's no harm done.

06:07.964 --> 06:10.219
Okay, sir,
bribery of a public officer

06:10.304 --> 06:11.976
is in violation of co...

06:14.464 --> 06:15.745

06:15.831 --> 06:17.870
Oh, you gotta be
kidding me.

06:20.925 --> 06:22.050
Murphy.

06:22.214 --> 06:23.557
Officer Bradford.

06:23.643 --> 06:25.338
Nice touch,
roping in a celebrity.

06:25.464 --> 06:27.379
Well, he had community service
hours to work off.

06:27.464 --> 06:29.049
You thought we'd let him go
'cause he's famous?

06:29.134 --> 06:30.419
Had I known it was you,

06:30.505 --> 06:32.638
I would've put a strung-out cop
behind the wheel.

06:32.729 --> 06:34.894
I know you have
a soft spot.

06:39.094 --> 06:40.823
Hey, excuse me,
does that mean I can go?

06:40.909 --> 06:43.204
Write him up.
Reckless driving.

06:43.305 --> 06:45.190
Giving false information
to a police officer.

06:45.276 --> 06:46.932
Disobedience
to traffic signs.

06:47.054 --> 06:49.034
Unlawful act
with a green air sticker.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.705
Driving with
an obstructed view.

06:50.836 --> 06:52.461
Unnecessary use of horn.

06:52.547 --> 06:55.073
Failure to exercise caution
when passing animals.

06:55.237 --> 06:56.303
Wha...

06:56.389 --> 06:57.870
Is he serious?!

07:00.120 --> 07:01.768
What if she's
one of the reversals?

07:01.924 --> 07:04.009
It's not your fault
her tacky dress broke

07:04.094 --> 07:05.893
when she tried
to stab a guy.

07:05.979 --> 07:07.314
If she's IA,
she'll report

07:07.400 --> 07:09.855
you used reasonable force
given the threat.

07:10.094 --> 07:12.629
You think it's possible
that the dress was designed

07:12.714 --> 07:14.419
to fail on contact?

07:14.504 --> 07:15.759
You know, like...

07:15.844 --> 07:17.580
those break-away pants?

07:18.367 --> 07:20.574
I'm gonna go finish
the paperwork.

07:24.607 --> 07:26.062
Thanks, you guys.

07:26.148 --> 07:27.643
Right this way.

07:27.766 --> 07:30.891
Please, believe me, I did not
mean to expose you like that.

07:31.093 --> 07:32.218
Um...

07:32.445 --> 07:33.480
The woman with the phone,

07:33.566 --> 07:34.715
I spoke to her.
She was very reasonable.

07:34.800 --> 07:35.950
I watched her delete
all the footage.

07:36.035 --> 07:37.570

Badge number.
25253.

07:47.058 --> 07:48.801
If you want to lodge
a complaint, that is your right.

07:48.886 --> 07:51.931
Oh, I'm gonna lodge
something... believe me.

07:56.269 --> 07:58.121
Yo, that's messed up.

07:58.207 --> 07:59.574
You went through
Wesley's phone?

07:59.674 --> 08:00.969
I thought he was
cheating on me.

08:01.061 --> 08:02.847
Cheating? You guys
only went on a few dates.

08:02.933 --> 08:04.348
I knew you wouldn't
understand.

08:04.464 --> 08:06.691
Oh, I understand,
I just don't approve.

08:07.313 --> 08:09.808
And I understand that's not
the tone to take with a T.O.,

08:09.894 --> 08:11.574
- so I take it back.
- Good.

08:11.660 --> 08:13.167
Except the
"that's messed up" part.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.409
That, I stand by.

08:15.683 --> 08:17.042
Whoa.

08:17.128 --> 08:18.629
How much you wanna bet
it's a reversal?

08:18.714 --> 08:20.234
That's pretty convincing
drunk-driving.

08:21.118 --> 08:22.413
$20 it's legit.

08:22.764 --> 08:24.832
Driver, pull over now.

08:36.806 --> 08:38.909
Unless IA's recruiting
out of grade school,

08:38.996 --> 08:41.097
I just made 20 bucks.

08:41.328 --> 08:42.743
Are you okay?

08:42.881 --> 08:44.256
Good. Get out.

08:44.343 --> 08:45.378
I can't.

08:45.464 --> 08:46.969
I have to get her
to the hospital.

08:47.054 --> 08:48.764
She's dying.
Lopez.

08:49.366 --> 08:52.246
My sister OD'd.
Please... help her!

08:56.904 --> 08:59.636
- She's barely breathing.
- Control, start RA to our location.

08:59.722 --> 09:01.222
Female, 20s, overdose.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.839
- Do you know what she took?
- No. I'm sorry.

09:02.924 --> 09:04.089
- Pupils are pin points.
- It's okay.

09:04.174 --> 09:05.910
It's probably heroin.
Get the NARCAN.

09:12.932 --> 09:14.620
Come on, stay with us.

09:15.257 --> 09:16.842
Here you go.
All right, step back.

09:16.935 --> 09:18.300
She's gonna be okay.

09:18.386 --> 09:20.181
This stuff will
wake her right up, all right?

09:20.531 --> 09:22.455
It'll wake her right up.

09:22.541 --> 09:24.557
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

09:24.643 --> 09:25.745
Come on.

09:25.831 --> 09:27.746
Come on.

09:27.832 --> 09:31.045
You got her help.
You saved her.

09:31.131 --> 09:32.666
It's all right,
just breathe.

09:34.437 --> 09:38.159
<i>7-Adam-19,
459 in progress, 117 Ayers.</i>

09:38.324 --> 09:40.119
Police!
We're coming in!

09:42.004 --> 09:45.674
<i>♪ Mother, I lie ♪</i>

09:45.852 --> 09:48.687
<i>♪ When I say I don't miss home ♪</i>

09:48.804 --> 09:49.919
Mushrooms?

09:50.004 --> 09:51.299
Hallucinogens.

09:51.384 --> 09:53.049
This is a grow house.

09:53.134 --> 09:56.379
Careful... these places
are usually booby trapped.

10:00.594 --> 10:02.455
Oh, my God.

10:02.828 --> 10:04.502
See? Booby trapped.

10:04.588 --> 10:06.393
Please, just get this thing
off of me.

10:06.479 --> 10:09.174
I-I don't think we should.
He could've severed an artery.

10:09.260 --> 10:10.519
The paramedics
will know what to do.

10:10.604 --> 10:12.386
No, no, no. We don't need
to call anybody else.

10:12.471 --> 10:14.547
There's like half a million
dollars' worth of mushrooms in here.

10:14.632 --> 10:17.047
We split it, you pretend
you never saw me...

10:17.149 --> 10:20.024
everybody wins.

10:20.384 --> 10:21.627
Okay.

10:21.741 --> 10:23.066
- What?!
- Really?

10:23.166 --> 10:25.495
Yeah.
But I want 60%.

10:25.642 --> 10:27.151
So, call Detective Murphy

10:27.264 --> 10:29.401
and ask her if that's okay
with Internal Affairs.

10:29.487 --> 10:30.502
Who?

10:30.588 --> 10:32.081
Wait, you think this
is another reversal?

10:32.166 --> 10:33.629
- Two in two hours?
- That's how they do it.

10:33.714 --> 10:35.019
They try and catch you
when your guard is down.

10:35.104 --> 10:36.259
What are you talking about?

10:36.344 --> 10:38.339
Look, I've got to say,
this is impressive FX work.

10:38.424 --> 10:41.009
But we are in Hollywood,
so, how'd you do it? Hmm?

10:41.094 --> 10:42.909
Metal plates?
Peg leg?

10:43.580 --> 10:45.339
Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
What are you doing?!

10:45.424 --> 10:46.469
Calling your bluff.

10:50.214 --> 10:52.885
<i>7-Adam-19, we need an RA
to 117 Ayers.</i>

10:53.073 --> 10:56.026
30-year-old male,
severe trauma to left leg.

10:58.298 --> 10:59.798
You're lucky
his leg's gonna be okay.

10:59.884 --> 11:01.259
If Murphy hadn't
gotten in my head,

11:01.344 --> 11:02.339
that never
would've happened.

11:02.424 --> 11:03.948
Blame the reversals,
not me.

11:04.034 --> 11:05.548
What happened
between you two?

11:05.634 --> 11:07.089
Did she investigate you
or something?

11:07.174 --> 11:08.495
Indirectly.

11:10.912 --> 11:12.912
Is it Isabel?

11:15.250 --> 11:17.205
Look, Murphy was
her investigating officer.

11:17.291 --> 11:19.088
Okay,
but you're not Isabel,

11:19.181 --> 11:20.745
- so what's her beef with you?
- Not your concern.

11:20.830 --> 11:22.510
Start the paperwork.

11:24.853 --> 11:26.398
- Everything okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

11:26.484 --> 11:28.315
Um, we had a reversal,

11:28.455 --> 11:30.136
but Officer Bradford saw right
through it, so...

11:30.221 --> 11:33.034
I heard. IA is stepping up their game
using celebrities. Yeah.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.698
- Stay vigilant.
- Mm.

11:34.784 --> 11:36.979
I wanted to say
I really appreciated

11:37.065 --> 11:38.565
what you said
earlier today...

11:38.651 --> 11:40.969
about cops doing
the right thing every day.

11:41.054 --> 11:42.214
Is that because
you're seeing evidence

11:42.299 --> 11:43.969
of officers
acting otherwise?

11:44.054 --> 11:46.221
No. Not at all.
I-I was just...

11:46.307 --> 11:47.379
Relax, Officer Chen.

11:47.464 --> 11:49.205
I'm not gonna ask you
to narc on anyone.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.369
But part of
protecting and serving

11:51.455 --> 11:53.955
is making sure you refuse to do
anything that crosses a line.

11:54.174 --> 11:55.919
So if anybody
is asking you to do so,

11:56.004 --> 11:57.995
- I expect you to come talk to me.
- Yes, ma'am.

11:58.081 --> 12:00.246
Okay. Tell me, how's that
new apartment working out?

12:00.451 --> 12:03.468
Oh. Uh, it's great.
It's in a quiet neighborhood.

12:03.554 --> 12:06.612
There's lots of coffee shops,
and people walking around.

12:10.994 --> 12:12.572
Comics?

12:12.852 --> 12:14.347
Yeah. Uh...

12:14.595 --> 12:16.550
I found it
in the lost and found.

12:16.714 --> 12:19.025
And by lost and found,
I mean my locker.

12:19.384 --> 12:20.564
Thanks.

12:20.758 --> 12:22.173
Yeah.

12:23.626 --> 12:25.541
So, what happens now?

12:25.627 --> 12:28.542
I... Your sister,
she's... she's stable.

12:28.797 --> 12:31.382
Uh, no reason that she can't
make a full recovery.

12:31.554 --> 12:33.142
Then it's up to her.

12:33.464 --> 12:35.228
But ODs have a way of, um,

12:35.314 --> 12:37.431
putting things
into perspective.

12:37.781 --> 12:40.556
My mom OD'd three times
before she died.

12:40.964 --> 12:43.634
Each time, she swore
she was gonna get clean.

12:44.704 --> 12:47.789
Cassie and I found her when
we went down for breakfast.

12:48.054 --> 12:49.306
She was blue.

12:49.486 --> 12:50.619
Yeah.

12:50.705 --> 12:51.822
You can't lose hope.

12:51.908 --> 12:53.986
Yeah.
That's what everyone says.

12:54.087 --> 12:55.626
'Cause it's true, Jake.

12:57.055 --> 12:59.681
Social Services is on their way
to get you placed somewhere safe

12:59.767 --> 13:01.494
while your sister
gets the help she needs.

13:01.580 --> 13:02.705
Okay?

13:02.884 --> 13:04.259
Sure.

13:07.878 --> 13:09.603
I'll be right back.

13:10.187 --> 13:12.658
Hey. Hold up.
Can we talk?

13:13.300 --> 13:14.619
Okay.

13:18.541 --> 13:20.494
I need
to explain something.

13:21.363 --> 13:23.150
My dad left
when I was a kid.

13:23.264 --> 13:25.509
And my mom never really
got past it.

13:25.594 --> 13:27.969
There was no one stable
growing up in my life,

13:28.054 --> 13:30.339
so I guess
what I'm trying to say

13:30.424 --> 13:32.839
is I think that's
the reason why I-I...

13:32.924 --> 13:34.501
I went through your phone.

13:36.782 --> 13:38.487
- You sound like my clients.
- What?

13:38.589 --> 13:39.798
Everybody's dad bailed.

13:39.884 --> 13:41.424
No one's mom
was perfect.

13:42.733 --> 13:44.228
Doesn't change
what you did.

13:44.314 --> 13:45.533
No, I know, but...

13:45.619 --> 13:46.719
You're a grown woman,

13:46.804 --> 13:49.884
so having a bad childhood
isn't a valid excuse anymore.

13:50.479 --> 13:53.939
Look, I wish I could
trust you again, but...

13:54.764 --> 13:56.384
I don't see how I can.

13:58.217 --> 13:59.717
I'm sorry.

14:07.102 --> 14:09.607
Tim was so convinced
we caught another reversal,

14:09.693 --> 14:11.564
he pried open
the bear trap.

14:11.736 --> 14:14.018
I've never seen someone actually
pass out from pain before.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.923
That's tough.
Not as bad as the helplessness

14:16.009 --> 14:17.658
in that kid's eyes.

14:19.214 --> 14:21.129
What about you?
Good day? Bad day?

14:21.267 --> 14:24.879
I had to pry a psycho off
a valet at a five-star hotel.

14:25.111 --> 14:27.906
Uh, her dress ripped
as I was cuffing her,

14:27.992 --> 14:29.298
exposing
her unmentionables.

14:29.384 --> 14:30.439
Boy, she was pissed.

14:30.525 --> 14:32.244
- Wow.
- What?

14:32.330 --> 14:34.150
That was for sure
a reversal.

14:34.304 --> 14:36.165
Yeah, dress
was probably rigged...

14:36.251 --> 14:37.509
- like break-away pants.
- Mmhmm.

14:37.594 --> 14:39.179
- That's what I thought!
- Yeah?

14:39.264 --> 14:40.379
Oh.

14:40.464 --> 14:41.879
Okay,
I see what you're doing.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.009
Can I get that to go,
please?

14:43.094 --> 14:44.509
No, come on!
Don't be like that.

14:44.594 --> 14:46.978
No, as much as I would love
to keep telling war stories...

14:47.064 --> 14:47.923
Thank you, Dez...

14:48.009 --> 14:50.049
I have another full day
of reversals tomorrow,

14:50.134 --> 14:52.306
and this rookie
needs his beauty sleep.

15:43.071 --> 15:44.406
Hey.

15:44.594 --> 15:46.509
So, they canvassed the area.
No one saw the shooter.

15:46.594 --> 15:47.870
He fired
a couple hundred rounds.

15:47.955 --> 15:49.549
Yeah, no one's admitting
they saw him.

15:49.634 --> 15:51.299
Yeah, patrol found
the car he escaped in.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.915
It was reported stolen
this afternoon.

15:53.001 --> 15:55.076
- SID is all over it.
- Who'd you piss off?

15:55.162 --> 15:56.788
Clearly someone with access
to heavy weaponry.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.244
I didn't recognize
the guy.

15:58.330 --> 15:59.901
According to intelligence,
you've been greenlit

15:59.986 --> 16:01.025
by Southern Front.

16:01.111 --> 16:02.879
- Greenlit?
- Means they put a hit on you.

16:02.964 --> 16:04.839
How's a rookie
get greenlit before me?

16:04.924 --> 16:07.134
I gotta step up my game.
It's not a badge of honor.

16:07.220 --> 16:09.682
Violent white supremacist gang wants
you dead, you're doing something right.

16:09.767 --> 16:11.969
I-I'm sorry, white supremacy
gang and greenlit?

16:12.054 --> 16:13.346
W-Wh... What the hell
is going on?

16:13.431 --> 16:14.884
Normally, gangs
don't target cops...

16:14.970 --> 16:16.219
more trouble
than it's worth.

16:16.304 --> 16:18.751
Unless a cop
disrespects a gang member,

16:18.837 --> 16:19.892
then all bets are off.

16:19.978 --> 16:22.533
You arrested a woman today.
Astrid Heisserer.

16:23.564 --> 16:25.878
Her dress broke.
I-I embarrassed her.

16:25.964 --> 16:27.275
I thought she was IA.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.986
She's not. She's the baby mama
of the leader of Southern Front,

16:30.134 --> 16:32.799
one of the most violent criminal
enterprises in the country.

16:32.884 --> 16:34.219
And because of how
you treated her,

16:34.304 --> 16:36.589
he authorized everyone
in the gang to kill you.

16:36.674 --> 16:38.814
- What about Talia?
- Yeah, what about me?

16:38.900 --> 16:40.415
Nolan is the one
who put hands on her.

16:40.501 --> 16:41.549
He's the one
they're after.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.361
How many Southern Front
members are there?

16:43.447 --> 16:46.298
In the greater Los Angeles area?
Several thousand.

16:46.384 --> 16:48.478
And protecting you will be
our number-one priority.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.447
Step one is to get you
off the streets.

16:50.533 --> 16:52.720
Come with me, Nolan.
I'm gonna escort you home.

17:00.123 --> 17:02.639
K9 unit already swept
the property.

17:03.054 --> 17:04.138
Owner
coming home tonight?

17:04.224 --> 17:06.913
Uh, no, Ben left
for New York yesterday.

17:06.999 --> 17:08.509
So, what's happening
here?

17:08.594 --> 17:10.803
The DA approved
a VARDA alarm.

17:10.888 --> 17:12.373
It bypasses 911,

17:12.459 --> 17:14.592
sends a red alert
to all the cops in the area.

17:14.719 --> 17:16.076
So, what's next?

17:16.214 --> 17:17.248
That's up to you.

17:17.334 --> 17:18.967
I mean, I can't just
go to work, right?

17:19.053 --> 17:21.299
I'd be endangering everyone who
came within five feet of me.

17:21.384 --> 17:22.969
Being a cop
is being at risk.

17:23.054 --> 17:24.568
So you're saying
I should just...

17:24.804 --> 17:26.701
report for duty,
act like nothing happened?

17:26.787 --> 17:29.326
I think we tell criminals what
to do, not the other way around.

17:29.412 --> 17:31.732
- No matter the consequences?
- No matter the consequences.

17:31.865 --> 17:34.129
But, look,
it's up to you.

17:34.214 --> 17:35.719
No one is gonna judge you
either way.

17:35.804 --> 17:36.867
Yeah, right.

17:36.953 --> 17:38.051
Nolan.

17:39.004 --> 17:40.639
This isn't about bravery.

17:40.804 --> 17:42.146
You have a family.

17:42.344 --> 17:44.974
Any cop who's ever worn a badge
understands that.

17:45.473 --> 17:46.834
<i>All set, Captain.</i>

17:46.976 --> 17:48.061
Okay.

17:48.147 --> 17:50.115
It seems the system
is up and armed.

17:50.201 --> 17:51.446
We have a unit
parked out front.

17:51.532 --> 17:52.777
Try to get some sleep.

17:53.037 --> 17:54.779
Don't see that happening.

17:55.091 --> 17:56.134
No.

17:56.404 --> 17:58.391
- Thank you.
- Have a good night.

17:59.543 --> 18:01.474
Hey.
What are you doing here?

18:01.565 --> 18:03.070
Guard duty.

18:03.241 --> 18:04.802
I think we have that covered.

18:04.888 --> 18:06.763
Now
it's extra covered.

18:07.014 --> 18:09.129
You call me directly
if anything happens.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.299
Yes, ma'am.

18:10.453 --> 18:11.533
Okay.

18:14.430 --> 18:16.845
West and Chen
reporting for duty.

18:17.102 --> 18:21.115
Guys, this is very sweet,
but honestly, it's unnecessary.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.809
You'd do the same
for us.

18:23.498 --> 18:25.232
So, how do you
want to do this?

18:25.318 --> 18:27.419
Personally, I'd go with
alternating two-hour shifts

18:27.504 --> 18:29.717
with a static position
plus a rover.

18:29.803 --> 18:32.943
Oh, and I have earpieces
and walkies,

18:33.029 --> 18:34.912
just so we can keep
in constant contact.

18:34.998 --> 18:36.259
You got anything sweet?

18:36.344 --> 18:37.629
Yeah, I think
there's some ice cream.

18:37.714 --> 18:39.469
- Mm.
- Wait, guys.

18:39.554 --> 18:40.701
Guys!

18:40.787 --> 18:42.834
Look, come on.
We need to stay focused.

18:43.564 --> 18:45.189
You know, the whole point
of guard duty

18:45.275 --> 18:47.650
is that we take turns being up
so everyone gets some sleep.

18:47.758 --> 18:49.092
You could've left
at any time.

18:49.178 --> 18:50.969
Yep. No one would've
given you grief.

18:51.054 --> 18:52.089
Yeah, right.

18:52.174 --> 18:54.209
- Ohh.
- We got to get to the station.

18:54.295 --> 18:55.839
Our shift starts soon.

18:55.998 --> 18:58.009
- I should go in.
- What... To work?

18:58.094 --> 18:59.259
Absolutely not.

18:59.344 --> 19:01.123
You're safest right here.

19:01.234 --> 19:03.007
We'll manage without you
for a few weeks at work.

19:03.092 --> 19:04.194
What if it's longer
than that?

19:04.279 --> 19:05.701
My training
would be put on hold,

19:05.794 --> 19:09.185
I'd... stay a rookie
while you guys moved up.

19:09.540 --> 19:11.068
We'd be separated.

19:12.804 --> 19:14.764
That's never
gonna happen.

19:15.196 --> 19:16.967
This, uh...
This will all be over soon.

19:17.053 --> 19:18.072
Yeah.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.943
And if it's not?

19:20.029 --> 19:21.574
Then it's...

19:21.844 --> 19:23.607
good you have a pool.

19:30.304 --> 19:32.748
All right.
Everyone, settle down.

19:32.845 --> 19:34.521
Captain.
Thank you for coming in...

19:34.607 --> 19:35.969
most of you on your day off.

19:36.054 --> 19:37.084
Till this is resolved,

19:37.170 --> 19:39.420
all overtime limits
have been lifted.

19:39.802 --> 19:41.542
As you may know,

19:41.628 --> 19:45.048
Southern Front originated as
a white supremacist prison gang

19:45.134 --> 19:46.396
about 15 years ago.

19:46.482 --> 19:48.623
Since then, they have
branched out in a big way.

19:48.714 --> 19:50.839
Drugs, prostitution,
extortion.

19:50.967 --> 19:52.443
But what sets them apart

19:52.529 --> 19:54.219
is their access
to military weapons.

19:54.304 --> 19:57.179
Their leader,
the so-called "King Midas,"

19:57.264 --> 20:00.799
is currently serving three
consecutive life sentences.

20:00.884 --> 20:02.068
His son, Cole,

20:02.154 --> 20:04.365
he controls the day-to-day
operations on the street.

20:04.451 --> 20:07.339
But make no mistake, his father
is pulling the strings.

20:07.424 --> 20:10.469
Lifting the greenlight would be
a huge loss of face for Cole,

20:10.592 --> 20:11.905
so he's not gonna do it
willingly.

20:11.990 --> 20:13.629
So, we gotta make this
a business decision.

20:13.714 --> 20:15.719
We put a big enough hurt
on their operation,

20:15.804 --> 20:17.504
they'll lift
the greenlight.

20:21.384 --> 20:23.299
Sorry I'm late.

20:49.117 --> 20:52.743
Yesterday, Southern Front
tried to kill one of our own.

20:52.969 --> 20:55.735
Today, we hit back.

21:03.791 --> 21:05.126
- What?
- Nothing.

21:05.555 --> 21:08.172
Look, everyone else sees
this big hero move,

21:08.258 --> 21:09.891
but I see your ego
getting in the way

21:09.977 --> 21:11.516
of you doing
the smart thing.

21:11.664 --> 21:13.258
Look.

21:13.553 --> 21:14.968
If you don't want
to ride with me...

21:15.054 --> 21:16.719
It's not about my safety.

21:16.805 --> 21:18.090
It's about yours.

21:18.176 --> 21:20.118
You're risking your life
to prove a point.

21:20.204 --> 21:21.665
Seems worth it
to me...

21:21.751 --> 21:23.466
if you're making
the right point.

21:23.584 --> 21:25.539
But there's no sense
in taking a needless risk,

21:25.625 --> 21:27.554
which is why Officer Nolan
will be staying far away

21:27.639 --> 21:29.594
from anything
Southern Front related.

21:29.951 --> 21:31.485
And I'll be riding
with him.

21:32.532 --> 21:34.533
Whether I agree
with his decision or not,

21:34.619 --> 21:35.704
he's my rookie.

21:35.790 --> 21:37.290
And I'll take
good care of him.

21:39.186 --> 21:40.438
Yes, ma'am.

21:43.929 --> 21:45.254
Riding
with the captain.

21:45.340 --> 21:47.425
And I thought being greenlit
was scary.

21:47.511 --> 21:48.556
I drive.

21:48.642 --> 21:50.097
Of course.

21:50.183 --> 21:51.558
Officer Nolan.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.304
- Keys.
- Yes.

21:54.984 --> 21:57.743
How exactly are we hurting
Midas' operation?

21:57.829 --> 21:59.299
By attacking Southern Front
where they make

21:59.384 --> 22:01.797
all their money...
the three Ts.

22:02.214 --> 22:04.179
Drug trafficking.

22:07.844 --> 22:09.422
Weapons trafficking.

22:11.561 --> 22:12.735
And sex trafficking.

22:12.991 --> 22:14.566
♪ Circle up, circle up ♪

22:14.714 --> 22:15.839
♪ Circle servant serpents ♪

22:15.924 --> 22:17.589

22:26.554 --> 22:27.549
I'll handle processing.

22:27.634 --> 22:29.629
You get started
on the asset paperwork.

22:29.714 --> 22:31.799
I still don't see how
confiscating 20 gallons of lube

22:31.884 --> 22:33.419
is gonna get the gang
to back off Nolan.

22:33.504 --> 22:35.839
Asset forfeiture is where we do
the most damage today.

22:35.924 --> 22:37.549
Law says we can seize
everything and anything

22:37.634 --> 22:39.339
connected to their
illegal operation.

22:39.424 --> 22:41.839
Vehicles, merchandise,
even the massage parlor.

22:41.924 --> 22:44.024
Well, so, why didn't
we hit it last week?

22:44.110 --> 22:45.712
Vice knew that
Southern Front owned that shop.

22:45.797 --> 22:46.680
'Cause
it's whack-a-mole.

22:46.782 --> 22:47.879
You take out one
criminal enterprise,

22:47.964 --> 22:49.129
another one
takes its place.

22:49.214 --> 22:50.629
Usually not a good use
of our time.

22:50.714 --> 22:51.969
But today,
that's exactly what we want.

22:52.054 --> 22:54.049
Make sure Southern Front's
scared one of their competitors

22:54.134 --> 22:56.379
- is about to move in, a...
- Move! Don't touch me, man! Come on!

22:56.464 --> 22:58.094
You gotta be kidding me.

22:59.521 --> 23:00.875
What the hell
are you doing here?

23:00.961 --> 23:02.836
My job. Making sure cops
don't break the law.

23:02.922 --> 23:04.281
One of our officers
was greenlit.

23:04.367 --> 23:05.547
Came within seconds
of being killed.

23:05.632 --> 23:07.672
When do you think that a cop's
most likely to cross a line?

23:07.757 --> 23:09.554
When they're scared,
angry, and want revenge.

23:09.674 --> 23:12.140
They might... I don't know...
yell at a detective.

23:12.226 --> 23:14.811
How about I write you up for
conduct unbecoming an officer?

23:14.897 --> 23:16.062
Knock yourself out.

23:16.147 --> 23:17.642
This is about Isabel,
and you know it.

23:17.728 --> 23:18.890
You know,
it is about Isabel.

23:18.976 --> 23:21.343
It's about the fact that
you covered for her for months.

23:21.453 --> 23:22.718
- That's not true.
- Oh, please.

23:22.804 --> 23:24.839
Any cop can tell an addict
10 miles out.

23:24.925 --> 23:26.090
You knew she was using,

23:26.176 --> 23:27.985
and you let her come to work
every day with a loaded gun.

23:28.070 --> 23:30.261
You had an obligation
to report her, and you didn't.

23:30.384 --> 23:31.362
Okay, that's a lie.

23:31.448 --> 23:33.074
But I'd expect nothing less
from a cop like you.

23:33.159 --> 23:35.075
Uh, hey, I need you
to come check something for me.

23:35.160 --> 23:37.278
I want to make sure I'm doing it
by the book, okay? So, come on.

23:37.363 --> 23:38.778
Hey, you know what?
If I were you,

23:38.864 --> 23:40.160
I'd ask
for another T.O.

23:40.246 --> 23:41.701
Yeah, well,
you're not me.

23:41.787 --> 23:43.322
Ma'am.

23:52.086 --> 23:54.324
I was told
there was a cop coming

23:54.499 --> 23:56.746
with the authority
to negotiate.

23:56.942 --> 23:58.375
Cut the crap.

23:58.461 --> 24:00.101
Only color you care about
is green.

24:00.187 --> 24:03.382
And the LAPD has taken
a lot of that from you today.

24:03.477 --> 24:06.515
Now, if you want to stop
the bleeding, sit your ass down.

24:12.317 --> 24:15.062
Look, I reviewed
the body cam footage.

24:15.148 --> 24:17.562
That girl tried to stab a guy
right in front of my officer.

24:17.647 --> 24:19.472
He used minimal force
to stop her...

24:19.557 --> 24:21.679
no disrespect was intended
or shown.

24:21.796 --> 24:23.617
Your son is overreacting,

24:23.703 --> 24:25.421
and I don't think
it's his first time.

24:25.609 --> 24:29.271
It's time for the adults
to de-escalate matters.

24:29.453 --> 24:30.901
You been in the game
long?

24:30.987 --> 24:32.049
Almost 20 years.

24:32.135 --> 24:34.729
Then you know I can't just
rescind the greenlight.

24:34.909 --> 24:36.352
It's gotta come from Cole.

24:36.495 --> 24:39.932
Any other way,
my guys don't respect him.

24:40.049 --> 24:42.752
Yeah.
Sucks to be you.

24:42.977 --> 24:44.312
Let me be clear.

24:44.397 --> 24:45.812
I'm not here to negotiate.

24:45.948 --> 24:48.284
We cost you $1 million
in lost revenue

24:48.409 --> 24:50.416
and three
in seized assets.

24:50.570 --> 24:52.330
And we're just
getting started.

24:53.136 --> 24:55.421
None of that matters
without honor.

24:55.670 --> 24:58.915
You're way out
on a ledge, Midas.

24:59.104 --> 25:02.260
In half a day, we shut down
seven of your businesses,

25:02.346 --> 25:04.522
put 46 of your men
behind bars,

25:04.607 --> 25:09.022
and just imagine the damage
we can do tomorrow,

25:09.190 --> 25:11.852
when we start hitting
your spots in San Diego,

25:11.937 --> 25:13.232
San Jose, Victorville.

25:13.317 --> 25:14.472
I can keep going.

25:14.557 --> 25:18.299
Your son... is about to destroy
everything you built

25:18.385 --> 25:20.472
because his girlfriend
yelled at him.

25:20.557 --> 25:23.776
Do the right thing...
call off the greenlight.

25:24.592 --> 25:27.791
<i>7-Adam-15,
possible 459 in progress,</i>

25:27.877 --> 25:29.604
<i>1936 Kristol Lane.</i>

25:29.690 --> 25:31.830
7-Adam-15,
show us responding.

25:32.230 --> 25:33.651
I hate this.

25:33.751 --> 25:35.807
Feels like everyone's
fighting my battle for me.

25:36.073 --> 25:37.817
City still needs
policing.

26:15.107 --> 26:16.232
Ah, that was...

26:16.317 --> 26:17.325
Exhilarating.

26:17.411 --> 26:19.161
I was gonna say
"terrifying."

26:21.107 --> 26:23.062
Guess I better
get used to that.

26:23.147 --> 26:26.114
You know, when I, uh... I was
first stationed in Baghdad,

26:26.286 --> 26:28.169
I used to get
these headaches.

26:28.669 --> 26:30.646
Took me a few days to realize
it was 'cause my eyes

26:30.731 --> 26:32.602
kept darting around,
looking for trouble.

26:32.687 --> 26:33.812
That's what it is.

26:33.897 --> 26:36.567
I didn't stop looking,
but it does stop hurting.

26:37.059 --> 26:40.142
<i>7-Adam-15, go to
channel 2 for Sergeant Grey.</i>

26:40.227 --> 26:41.832
Copy.

26:42.785 --> 26:43.926
Andersen.

26:44.012 --> 26:45.102
<i>It worked.</i>

26:45.187 --> 26:47.473
<i>Midas forced Cole
to lift the greenlight.</i>

26:50.453 --> 26:53.309
I guess you are back to being
just another rookie.

26:53.477 --> 26:55.392
Thank God.

26:55.477 --> 26:56.732
Thank you, Sergeant.

26:56.984 --> 26:58.102
<i>My pleasure.</i>

26:58.387 --> 26:59.382
So, does that mean

26:59.468 --> 27:01.682
this little "Odd Couple"
partnership is over?

27:01.767 --> 27:02.812
Hell no!

27:02.897 --> 27:04.914
We got a burglary call
to take.

27:07.540 --> 27:10.593
7-Adam-15, show us Code 6
on the burglary call.

27:10.750 --> 27:12.472
Be advised,
we have an open door.

27:12.562 --> 27:14.007
Going in to clear.

27:55.006 --> 27:56.595
Nolan! Cover...

28:00.882 --> 28:02.618
Hey, there!

28:23.187 --> 28:24.678
Look who's awake.

28:27.100 --> 28:29.585
Packs quite a kick,
doesn't it?

28:29.897 --> 28:33.506
It's got four times the voltage
as LAPD uses.

28:34.497 --> 28:38.694
Could probably cook the eyeball
right out of your skull.

28:38.780 --> 28:39.937
Okay, look, look,
I did not intend

28:40.022 --> 28:41.022
to disrespect Astrid,
okay?

28:41.107 --> 28:42.022
Or you, okay?

28:42.107 --> 28:43.538
And I would be happy
to apologize.

28:43.624 --> 28:45.022
Too late for that now.

28:45.107 --> 28:47.772
Only way this ends
is with you dead.

28:49.607 --> 28:52.825
Yeah, I, uh...
I'd heard that you were dumb,

28:53.294 --> 28:55.642
but it is shocking
to see it in person.

28:55.728 --> 28:57.317
- Dumb?
- Dumb.

28:58.977 --> 29:01.772
Who lured you into an ambush
with a false surrender?

29:01.857 --> 29:03.417
Does your father know
that it was false?

29:03.520 --> 29:04.911
Huh, junior?

29:05.434 --> 29:08.262
I can't imagine that revelation's
gonna go too well, huh?

29:12.015 --> 29:13.770
I think it'll go fine.

29:14.725 --> 29:17.260
Oh, he's dumber
than I thought.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.681
What's my rank?

29:19.767 --> 29:21.732
- What?
- What is my rank?

29:21.817 --> 29:22.932
Come on, you're the leader

29:23.017 --> 29:25.442
of the sixth-largest gang
in all of California.

29:25.528 --> 29:27.602
Surely you can tell
from my uniform what rank I am.

29:27.687 --> 29:28.857
Who the hell cares?

29:30.321 --> 29:31.755
You're going to.

29:32.607 --> 29:34.584
See, it's one thing
to put a hit out on a rookie...

29:34.669 --> 29:35.844
- No offense.
- None taken.

29:35.930 --> 29:37.348
But two bars?

29:39.187 --> 29:40.262
Oh,
for crying out loud.

29:40.348 --> 29:42.692
And a badge
that says "Captain"?

29:43.817 --> 29:46.176
You've just crossed a line
that anybody with half a brain

29:46.262 --> 29:47.481
would run screaming from.

29:47.567 --> 29:50.522
A line that even your father
might whack you for crossing.

29:50.794 --> 29:52.176
Understood?

29:52.436 --> 29:54.715
So, let me tell you
how this is gonna go.

29:54.958 --> 29:57.145
You and your little goonies
are gonna...

29:57.231 --> 29:59.936
No! Hey! Cole!

30:00.267 --> 30:01.562
Hurt me! Right?

30:01.647 --> 30:03.169
I'm the one
you wanna hurt, right?

30:03.255 --> 30:05.879
Killing me, that's trouble
you can handle, okay?

30:05.965 --> 30:06.772
But not her.
You need to let her go.

30:06.857 --> 30:08.442
- Do you think I'm dumb, too?
- No.

30:08.871 --> 30:10.364
No.

30:13.040 --> 30:14.497
No!

30:16.884 --> 30:18.559
No! No!

30:18.645 --> 30:19.975
No!

30:22.242 --> 30:23.747
If the line's
already been crossed,

30:23.833 --> 30:25.482
then there's
no going back.

30:25.568 --> 30:28.646
Which means neither of you
are walking out of here.

30:29.427 --> 30:31.404
As long as your bodies
never turn up,

30:31.490 --> 30:33.943
the murder can't be pinned on me.
No, you're wrong.

30:34.029 --> 30:35.561
And Southern Front'll
weather the storm.

30:35.646 --> 30:37.208
It's gonna be
so much worse.

30:37.294 --> 30:39.044
You need to get her
out of there now.

30:39.239 --> 30:41.234
Hey, listen.
What about this?

30:41.437 --> 30:43.195
What if I...
What if I made a video?

30:43.281 --> 30:46.023
I'll apologize to Astrid.
You just have to let her up.

30:46.109 --> 30:47.215
I already told you
that it's not gonna

You'll get laid for weeks.

30:55.300 --> 30:56.305
Okay, yeah.

30:56.391 --> 30:58.022
Okay. Just get her out first.
Right now.

30:58.107 --> 31:00.562
No, you got to make the video first.
We're gonna tape it... take it... Come on!

Yeah, here.

than that. I am sorry.

let her up now?

Nah, you got to
do it again.

31:13.477 --> 31:14.732
You got to put
some feeling into it.

31:14.817 --> 31:16.392
I didn't believe that.
Come on, man!

Do it again! No!

We have a job to finish.

Midas gave up his son.
We know where he's headed.

35:46.647 --> 35:48.380
What you want to do
more than anything.

35:48.557 --> 35:51.115
I'd be lying if I said
I didn't want it, too.

35:51.508 --> 35:53.709
Word is... you kill a cop,

35:53.937 --> 35:56.599

But that's...

36:02.176 --> 36:04.982
that's not what
Captain Andersen would want.

36:07.607 --> 36:10.602
Killing this loser
won't honor her memory.

36:10.687 --> 36:12.865
Doing our jobs will.

36:13.556 --> 36:16.971
And we owe it to her
to do it the right way.

36:17.126 --> 36:18.216
Agreed?

36:21.975 --> 36:23.826

You were right.

36:31.482 --> 36:33.267
I was selfish.
I got her killed.

36:33.415 --> 36:34.966
No. Don't do that.

36:35.059 --> 36:36.395
Don't make this about you.

36:36.517 --> 36:37.972
She didn't die
because of your choice.

36:38.057 --> 36:40.505
She died doing her job
the only way she knew how.

36:40.692 --> 36:43.802
Look at it any other way,
you diminish her.

36:48.482 --> 36:51.017
Look, you need to know that
no matter what happens next...

36:51.103 --> 36:52.982
whether we arrest this guy
or we kill him...

36:53.107 --> 36:55.232
- it won't make things better.
- I know that.

36:55.317 --> 36:57.182
No.
You only think you do.

Please don't tell me
to "use it"...

the grief or the anger...
to make myself a better cop.

37:01.017 --> 37:02.272
I can't handle that
right now.

37:02.357 --> 37:03.432
- I wasn't going to.
- Okay?

37:03.517 --> 37:05.076
Grief is grief.
It's...

37:05.162 --> 37:06.642
It's a hole
that can't be filled,

37:06.727 --> 37:08.022
but over time,
it'll shrink enough

37:08.107 --> 37:10.412
so that you won't fall in
every time you take a step.

37:10.647 --> 37:12.392
But trust me, if there's
one thing you can use

37:12.477 --> 37:13.888
to make yourself
a better cop,

37:13.974 --> 37:16.344
it'll be her life...
not her death.

without a fight?

I hope not.

Hello?

37:28.884 --> 37:31.020
Hey. I heard what happened.
I'm so sorry.

37:31.232 --> 37:32.807
Thanks. I-I really
can't talk right now.

37:32.957 --> 37:34.900

earlier.

They don't really matter
right now.

maybe shoot a guy.
