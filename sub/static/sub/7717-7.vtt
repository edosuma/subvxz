WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.083
Uh, what else? I've seen
 Dirty Dancing like, ten times...

00:04.400 --> 00:06.164
- Breaks my heart every time, you know?
- Whoa!

00:06.280 --> 00:07.486
Andy!

00:07.560 --> 00:09.608
That Swayze sure
can dance dirty.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.484
Don't you have
any sunblock?

00:11.680 --> 00:13.364
No, Walter J's
been hoarding it.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.807
If you want to worry about a part
of my body, worry about my eyes.

00:16.480 --> 00:18.926
They're like two flaming
meatballs in my skull.

00:19.160 --> 00:22.642
Last week, Andy set sail for the
Bahamas to sell his family's boat.

00:22.880 --> 00:24.803
And he took his
brother but not me.

00:25.480 --> 00:29.485
I was kind of sad at first, but then
I remembered that Bob Marley song,

00:30.040 --> 00:32.281
"No, woman. No cry!"

00:32.800 --> 00:33.847
Check this out.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.450
Keeps my hair
out of my stare.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.411
Also helps me
combat the Glare Bear.

00:38.480 --> 00:39.811
That's what I
call the sun now.

00:39.920 --> 00:42.446
Andy, it's Darryl. Take
your drawers off your head.

00:42.680 --> 00:45.570
What else can I show you?
Damn it!

00:47.280 --> 00:49.760
Oh, Andy, was that
your drinking water?

00:49.880 --> 00:53.043
Yeah, it was. That's okay, though.
I've got this cool

00:53.760 --> 00:55.285
desalinator device.

00:55.560 --> 00:59.246
It sucks up sea water through this
hose and pumps out fresh water.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.527
See? Check it out.

01:01.600 --> 01:02.601
Ow!

01:05.560 --> 01:06.641
That's not good.

01:06.720 --> 01:09.690
I'd better sign off.
I need to get going.

01:09.760 --> 01:11.410
I mean, these Skype sessions
are, like, the only thing

01:11.480 --> 01:13.323
that keep me sane
out here, you know?

01:18.280 --> 01:20.044
He's been
sailing for two days.

01:20.840 --> 01:24.845
I'll leave you with this, the
image of a man and his boat!

01:25.000 --> 01:26.684
Burn this into your brains!

01:27.200 --> 01:30.010
Yeah.
No.No, No!

01:31.840 --> 01:36.846
Andy? Andy? Andy? Andy?

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.400 --> 01:51.561
Dwight Schrute.

01:53.840 --> 01:55.649
Well, hi there,
David Wallace.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.969
Why would you ever call me when
the manager is out of town?

01:59.120 --> 02:01.088
Well, I have some
very exciting news.

02:01.160 --> 02:03.606
And you didn't call Jim.
That seems significant.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.882
Hi, David! Jim, good. You
should hear this, too.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.008
No, he shouldn't!
What? Jim!

02:08.080 --> 02:09.570
Go ahead, David.
I'm listening.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.887
I... Okay, David, I want
to take you off speaker.

02:11.960 --> 02:15.089
But I don't know
where I'd put you.

02:15.160 --> 02:16.730
Guys, listen.
This is big news.

02:17.040 --> 02:19.850
The Scranton White Pages just
got in contact with my office.

02:19.920 --> 02:22.890
They have apparently dropped their
supplier for the last ten years.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.241
The White Pages.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.007
The White Pages.
Do you want it? No.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.241
Do you use it? No.

02:29.360 --> 02:32.091
Does it inexplicably show up on
your doorstep three times a year?

02:32.160 --> 02:34.447
Yes, yes and yes.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.522
There is a reason we
in the paper industry

02:36.640 --> 02:38.642
call this thing
the White Whale.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.284
Look at all
that sweet blubber.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.371
Look, we need our
top salesman

02:45.440 --> 02:47.363
running point on this,
and Dwight, that is you.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.324
I'm going to need to
put you on hold for a second.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.769
Yeah! Whoo!

02:56.120 --> 02:58.885
Eat it, Jim!
Eat it, Phyllis! Eat...

02:59.920 --> 03:01.524
Where's Stanley?
He's in the bathroom.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.444
Will you run into the bathroom
and tell him to eat it?

03:03.520 --> 03:04.851
Of course.

03:05.720 --> 03:09.088
Yeah! Okay.
Hey, David, I'm back.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.281
Eat it, Stanley!

03:10.720 --> 03:14.566
So, last I remember Tom Peterman
was in charge of that account?

03:14.640 --> 03:16.483
No, my assistant spoke to the
receptionist over there.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.528
It's someone new but she
didn't catch her name.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.801
Her name?

03:21.040 --> 03:23.168
No. Hey, Dwight shouldn't...

03:23.720 --> 03:25.643
Thanks, David! Thank you so
much for calling me today.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.290
Good luck!
Good luck to you.

03:27.720 --> 03:28.801
Dwight, you can't go.

03:28.920 --> 03:31.082
You have a problem with women.
You can't sell to them.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.128
That's a damnable lie.
I love women.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.601
Gina Rogers at Apex Technology

03:36.000 --> 03:38.890
said you called her "Jine-a"
for your entire meeting.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.001
NELLIEI EW.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.401
That's not good.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.041
Yeah, she said she
corrected him five times.

03:45.640 --> 03:46.641
"Jine-a" said that?

03:46.960 --> 03:48.724
Guys, we can't let
Dwight blow this!

03:48.840 --> 03:51.207
An account this size
could double our gross!

03:51.480 --> 03:53.369
That means raises, bonuses.

03:54.240 --> 03:55.685
Pizza Friday could come back.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.167
Hey, remember that week in
the '90s when we got bagels?

03:58.240 --> 03:59.765
I miss Clinton.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.001
Can you go instead?

04:01.080 --> 04:03.048
Can't. I have the thing.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.523
I have this conference call
today with this company

04:06.640 --> 04:07.880
in Philly
that I'm helping start.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.405
First board meeting.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.207
Also the first time I've ever
been excited about work,

04:12.560 --> 04:14.164
so, that feels

04:15.240 --> 04:16.446
wrong.

04:17.920 --> 04:21.129
Okay, calm down, it's
just me, not Tom Selleck.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.801
Nice.

04:23.880 --> 04:26.850
Toby got us all to
participate in Movember.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.208
It's a charity
for prostate cancer.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.204
You pledge money and
then you grow a mustache

04:31.280 --> 04:32.520
for the month of November.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.365
So, this is how
we look now.

04:34.840 --> 04:36.524
I hope you like being
turned on all the time.

04:38.360 --> 04:39.805
Damn!

04:39.880 --> 04:41.405
Just keeps on coming, huh?

04:41.520 --> 04:43.124
I have very
fertile hair glands.

04:43.920 --> 04:48.130
I am so glad I got all of
the dudes to do Movember.

04:48.760 --> 04:51.047
We have the dopest
time back in the annex.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.161
God.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.961
We even go to lunch,
pick up babes.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.244
Smile if you love
men's prostates!

05:01.400 --> 05:03.323
Hi.
Hi.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.571
Spring cleaning?

05:05.720 --> 05:07.370
More like fall cleaning.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.321
I think the Senator
is having an affair.

05:14.720 --> 05:16.245
This doesn't...

05:16.720 --> 05:18.370
I'm sorry, what?

05:18.560 --> 05:21.325
I think the Senator
is having an affair.

05:22.480 --> 05:26.769
I literally have nightmares in
which what just happened happens.

05:27.440 --> 05:28.771
I wake up in a sweat,

05:29.920 --> 05:32.605
and then I make Angela's
husband spoon me back to bed.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.690
When he comes home
in the morning,

05:35.800 --> 05:37.290
he has this
secret little smile.

05:37.520 --> 05:38.806
Aww...

05:38.880 --> 05:41.201
I'm sure that's nothing.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.568
And he's always
at the yoga studio.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.643
He never misses
the noon class.

05:46.320 --> 05:47.845
Hot Yoga with Blake.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.606
Angela,
Blake is also a guy's name,

05:50.760 --> 05:53.684
so he may be spending his
afternoons with a guy named Blake,

05:53.880 --> 05:55.484
so nothing to worry about.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.441
Huh.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.322
Blake. Who's Blake?

06:01.400 --> 06:02.401
I don't know.

06:02.520 --> 06:04.841
I've just never heard
about the Senator and yoga.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.321
Right.
From you.

06:07.560 --> 06:08.971
I'm sure it's
probably nothing.

06:09.480 --> 06:10.766
But what's with
the yoga already?

06:10.840 --> 06:11.887
Right?
And Blake?

06:11.960 --> 06:13.644
Right! All right,
Angela, calm down.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.888
We need to go and check this out.
What?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.490
Angela, I'll go with you.

06:19.560 --> 06:22.769
So, show us how you'd normally
sell to a female client.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.645
Okay, with pleasure.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.081
Time to learn a few
new tricks, old dog.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.446
You got this, Schrute.

06:28.520 --> 06:32.320
You've just walked
into her office and begin.

06:33.080 --> 06:34.320
Hello.
Hello.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.686
May I please
speak to your boss?

06:35.800 --> 06:37.165
No, she is the boss.

06:37.240 --> 06:38.321
I am?
Yes.

06:40.680 --> 06:43.001
Hi, I'm Mr. Hannon,
how can I help you?

06:43.080 --> 06:44.570
Okay, this isn't
working for me,

06:44.640 --> 06:47.484
because no one would ever believe
that she would be a boss.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.324
He's absolutely right,
I'm really struggling here.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.408
I'll be the buyer.

06:51.680 --> 06:52.681
Okay-

06:54.040 --> 06:56.441
Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you.
Please have a seat.

06:56.560 --> 06:59.291
I never sit down
during sales meetings.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.522
I want to appear
aggressive and imposing.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.609
I am going to sell to
you in 12 minutes.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.968
No, actually, she'd like to take
her time discussing her needs.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.885
I will tell her what her needs
are and then fill them.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.010
This is going to
work out best for you

07:12.360 --> 07:14.886
if you just relax
and do nothing.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.686
And once I'm finished,
it's over.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.520
Okay, let's stop here.
Anyone have any thoughts?

07:21.600 --> 07:23.011
I thought it went great.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.282
I have written down
a few questions.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.682
One, have you ever
killed a woman?

07:27.880 --> 07:29.484
How many women
have you killed?

07:29.880 --> 07:31.211
Please sir,
will you not kill me?

07:35.720 --> 07:36.960
Okay,
let's get started.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.565
Okay, cool. Are we all on?

07:38.800 --> 07:41.610
Well, you're the only one
"on." We're all here.

07:42.800 --> 07:43.926
Right.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.561
Okay, over the next
three months, I...

07:46.640 --> 07:48.847
That's the winter season,
three months.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.961
I had some ideas actually...

07:52.040 --> 07:53.724
Are you at your
office right now?

07:54.160 --> 07:57.482
Yeah. Trust me, I would
rather be with you guys.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.483
Okay. Yeah,
it's sounding kind of

07:59.600 --> 08:01.568
spooky-sexy
over here, Halpert.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.245
Oh.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.402
Sorry. I was
saying that you should probably...

08:05.480 --> 08:06.766
Whoa.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.844
I think there's... I think
there's been a mistake.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.161
We're trying to reach Jim
Halpert, not Batman.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.207
You know what?
I should have just had...

08:16.280 --> 08:17.645
I should have just had you
call me on my cell.

08:17.720 --> 08:19.722
Yeah. I'll... I'm going to
try a different spot. Okay?

08:19.800 --> 08:21.290
Okay, yeah. Okay. I'll
call you right back.

08:21.440 --> 08:23.886
Cool. What's happening
in three months?

08:25.600 --> 08:26.931
Okay, when you're
selling to women,

08:27.080 --> 08:28.445
it is crucial that
you listen, Dwight.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.164
Also, you want to
respect their...

08:33.600 --> 08:34.760
Are you listening now?

08:35.280 --> 08:36.280
Yes.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.369
Okay, well,
you have to show us.

08:38.440 --> 08:41.330
That's impossible. Listening happens
in the ear and in the brain.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.368
I mean, some organisms
have external hairs

08:43.480 --> 08:45.448
that vibrate to
indicate auditory stimulation,

08:45.520 --> 08:49.570
but unfortunately our external
hairs don't vibrate at all.

08:49.640 --> 08:51.802
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.445
What are you doing?

08:53.760 --> 08:58.209
A little smile and a nod shows
that I hear you. Got it?

08:58.480 --> 08:59.481
Kind of.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.926
Nellie,
why don't you tell Dwight

09:01.040 --> 09:02.280
what we were
doing earlier today,

09:02.360 --> 09:04.124
and Dwight, you show us
that you're listening.

09:04.480 --> 09:08.041
Well, we were in the warehouse
where we were discussing the mural

09:08.120 --> 09:10.088
that I've commissioned
Pam to paint there.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.770
We were talking about
the color schemes

09:11.880 --> 09:13.450
and the major themes
we want to hit.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.086
Children of the world
coming together,

09:16.240 --> 09:18.720
cutting down trees
to make paper,

09:19.280 --> 09:21.328
but not in
a child labor-y way.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.849
It's just up and down, just a
regular nod, like a person.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.121
I am a person.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.201
Yes. Yeah.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.169
Of course. You're a person.
We can do this. All right?

09:29.440 --> 09:31.090
And then we thought we'd...

09:31.640 --> 09:33.927
I can't. I just, I can't carry
on with that face. Look at it.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.604
I'm going to get
nightmares with that face.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.247
I mean, he looks like
he's laboring over

09:38.360 --> 09:40.647
a stool having just
eaten human flesh.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.001
That's a bit extreme.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.241
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but that is true.

09:43.320 --> 09:45.322
He's screwed! The meeting
is in less than an hour.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.968
All right, God, Dwight, just
ignore every instinct you have.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.690
It's all garbage. Okay?

09:51.040 --> 09:53.850
You're the woman,
I'm the salesman.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.968
Watch what I do
and try to learn.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.567
Okay, I'm the woman. I'm a woman. Good?

09:58.840 --> 09:59.841
No.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.767
Ms. Thomas!
So good to see you.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.440
Hello.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.800
Are those your kids?
They're so cute.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.041
They could be models.

10:07.160 --> 10:08.924
Thank you.
I'm so proud of them.

10:09.400 --> 10:13.121
I carried each one of them for
nine months inside of my torso

10:13.200 --> 10:15.009
and then pushed
them out of my vagina.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.208
Boo. Weird.

10:17.280 --> 10:21.001
Okay, well, this is a lost cause.
He's hopeless.

10:21.080 --> 10:25.404
Ten years ago I didn't care if Dwight got
married or died a beet farming bachelor.

10:26.280 --> 10:28.123
But having kids
makes you so soft.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.207
I used to watch Pulp Fiction
 and laugh, and now I'm like,

10:31.280 --> 10:33.601
that poor Gimp
is somebody's child.

10:35.480 --> 10:37.608
You know, I think there
could be a lot of benefits

10:37.680 --> 10:39.011
if you could learn to
get along with women.

10:39.440 --> 10:40.930
I have no problem with women.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.048
It's business women
and their...

10:43.160 --> 10:45.925
Their power suits
and their shoulder pads.

10:46.040 --> 10:47.804
Don't lie about
your shoulders!

10:48.160 --> 10:49.446
Dwight, listen to me.

10:49.800 --> 10:53.930
Business women are just normal,
nice, reasonable people.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.925
Who's a nice, reasonable
person, in your experience?

10:58.520 --> 11:01.205
I had a barber once who used
to comb my hair gently.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.081
Okay. So, when you're
selling to this woman,

11:04.160 --> 11:06.481
just imagine she's that nice,
reasonable barber.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.249
Okay. I can do that.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.765
Good. Baby steps.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.649
He used to fight dogs.

11:14.240 --> 11:18.689
Like, he used to make dogs fight,
or he actually fought dogs?

11:19.080 --> 11:20.525
Little of this,
little of that.

11:23.640 --> 11:25.210
Which one is
the instructor?

11:25.560 --> 11:26.846
They're all fatties.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.683
Angela. Angela.
What? Where?

11:30.560 --> 11:31.607
The stairs,
the stairs.

11:31.720 --> 11:32.767
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.965
So wait, Blake is a her.

11:36.480 --> 11:38.289
Oh, my God!

11:38.560 --> 11:40.722
She's so stunningly tiny.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.964
She's like a petite double
zero, for sure. For sure.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.280
Holy cow,
look at what they're doing.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.326
She's repositioning his hips
for Downward Facing Dog.

11:50.560 --> 11:52.642
I've heard of this.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.001
D°9 Style!

11:55.200 --> 11:57.123
Wait! Look, Oscar!

11:57.480 --> 11:59.130
Thumbelina has a boyfriend.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.607
And he has a ponytail. Ew.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.723
I'd like to see
that run for office.

12:03.960 --> 12:07.169
Oscar, you were right, I had
nothing to be worried about.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.284
Thank you.
Let's go, let's go.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.287
Shut up. Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on. Just, sorry.

12:13.760 --> 12:14.841
Look.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.687
This is fun.
You know?

12:21.360 --> 12:23.010
I mean, this is fun.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.763
What I was saying
is the genius of

12:25.880 --> 12:27.848
Air Jordan was not in
the market saturation,

12:27.960 --> 12:29.564
it was...

12:30.000 --> 12:31.968
It was what?
Sorry...

12:32.040 --> 12:33.530
Jim we're having a lot
of trouble hearing you.

12:33.560 --> 12:37.406
The... What I was saying is, the real
genius was in the...

12:38.000 --> 12:40.082
Hey! Are those
skateboarders back?

12:40.160 --> 12:41.321
Jim? Jim, are you there?

12:41.440 --> 12:42.521
Where are they?

12:42.600 --> 12:44.090
The little punks!

12:44.240 --> 12:45.730
It was in
the authentic design, right?

12:45.800 --> 12:46.767
So, I mean,
you really felt like

12:46.840 --> 12:47.921
Michael Jordan was wearing
these shoes for...

12:48.000 --> 12:50.287
Jim, who's messing with my van?
Nobody.

12:50.360 --> 12:52.044
Jordan wore them for nobody?

12:52.120 --> 12:54.248
No, no. We're not
following you, Halpert.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.807
This ends now!

12:58.360 --> 13:00.601
Have a seat.
She will be right in.

13:00.680 --> 13:03.206
Great. I'm sorry, do you
mind telling me her name?

13:03.280 --> 13:04.964
I realize we don't have it.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.320
Uh, she'll be right in.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.765
Okay, great.
She'll...

13:09.840 --> 13:10.921
Okay-

13:11.720 --> 13:14.724
Just a little off the top,
and then a nice combing.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.886
Yeah. Just comb it.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.004
Oh, my God.

13:30.280 --> 13:31.281
It's Jan.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.561
Dear God in heaven.

13:38.040 --> 13:39.804
Jan used to be
one of my superiors,

13:39.920 --> 13:41.843
and she is one of
the most erratic

13:41.960 --> 13:43.928
and terrifying people
I have ever met.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.922
You son of a bitch! You're firing me?
I answered you...

13:49.200 --> 13:50.611
Where the hell do you get off?

13:50.880 --> 13:53.804
Jim and I are pretty sure she had
an affair with her ex-assistant, Hunter.

13:53.920 --> 13:54.921
He was 17.

13:55.560 --> 13:56.607
But she looks great!

13:57.800 --> 13:59.450
If she asks, will you
tell her I said that?

14:00.800 --> 14:02.370
Forget
everything we taught you!

14:07.800 --> 14:10.280
Hey, Jan!
It's so great to see you.

14:10.360 --> 14:11.964
Where's Wallace?
What?

14:12.200 --> 14:14.328
I was under the impression
David Wallace would be coming.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.811
He bought back
Dunder Mifflin, correct?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.001
Hey!

14:18.320 --> 14:20.482
Your daughter could
be a bubble bath model.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.842
I could just
bite her head off.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.124
Sorry.

14:26.680 --> 14:28.125
David is in Vermont.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.407
Did you speak with him?
He sent Dwight instead.

14:30.640 --> 14:31.641
Molly!

14:33.200 --> 14:35.282
David Wallace
is in Vermont.

14:35.640 --> 14:37.642
Oh, my God.
I talked to his assistant,

14:37.800 --> 14:39.802
and I guess it did
get a little confusing

14:39.880 --> 14:41.769
because you said not
to tell anyone your name.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.645
And then also, these Bluetooths
are very hard to hear with.

14:44.720 --> 14:45.846
I know you love
the way they look,

14:45.920 --> 14:47.126
but Tom never had
us use them, so...

14:47.240 --> 14:50.801
Molly? I am not Tom. lam Jan.

14:51.480 --> 14:52.811
I'm so sorry, Jan.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.285
Anyway-

14:58.840 --> 15:03.243
Thought it would be fun to
have a little chat with

15:03.320 --> 15:05.322
David Wallace
after all these years.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.804
Oh, Well.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.444
What are you doing?
Listening.

15:12.680 --> 15:13.681
- Stop.
- Sorry.

15:13.760 --> 15:14.966
Stop that.
Okay.

15:16.880 --> 15:20.726
So, this was all just a trick? You don't
really have any business to give?

15:21.320 --> 15:22.924
No, I do.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.610
But not to us.

15:24.720 --> 15:26.165
Insightful, Pam.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.288
You did good, Dwight. It's okay.
Seriously, Jan's not normal.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.601
Let's just go. She's not
going to sell to us.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.125
Yes, she is.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.922
Now, I may not have
any instincts with women,

15:38.040 --> 15:39.929
butlhave
an instinct for sales.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.764
You keep her occupied,
I'll be right back.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.161
What?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.001
Pam.
Yeah?

15:45.080 --> 15:46.445
I'm a very
busy woman, so...

15:46.520 --> 15:49.683
Yeah, do you have any
other pictures of Astrid?

15:50.880 --> 15:53.724
Fine, I will show you
one slideshow.

15:56.240 --> 15:57.446
Erin, did this call come...

15:58.320 --> 16:00.322
Sorry. I just...
I saw your face.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.401
Oh.

16:01.800 --> 16:02.881
I'm sorry.
It's for the thing.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.166
I know. That's great.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.289
It just, it makes it look
like there's an eyebrow

16:06.400 --> 16:07.731
in the middle of your face.

16:07.920 --> 16:08.967
Wow.

16:09.040 --> 16:13.329
A handsome eyebrow! But it makes
your mouth look like an eye socket.

16:13.400 --> 16:14.401
Which isn't bad!

16:14.560 --> 16:16.767
Uh-huh. Butyoulook
like a cyclops

16:17.400 --> 16:19.880
whose eye fell out.

16:20.720 --> 16:23.485
Which is great.
It's such a great cause.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.161
Yeah.

16:30.960 --> 16:34.760
Mommy, you're a princess

16:34.920 --> 16:39.289
Mommy, you're a superstar

16:39.400 --> 16:43.530
Mommy, you're the greatest

16:43.600 --> 16:45.762
How can I ever
fill your shoes?

16:51.560 --> 16:54.211
Your voice is
as lovely as ever.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.281
Oh...

16:55.360 --> 16:57.681
And it is so cute
how she signs her name.

16:57.760 --> 17:00.491
That was... That was me, too.

17:00.720 --> 17:04.327
Okay. It's just, that's how Cece
does it, with the backwards Es.

17:04.599 --> 17:05.839
Cece can't spell her name?

17:06.000 --> 17:07.286
Actually, she can.

17:07.359 --> 17:08.885
Well, it's not really much
of a comparison, is it?

17:08.960 --> 17:11.566
I mean, "Cece" is two
letters, and "Astrid" is...

17:11.720 --> 17:15.520
I mean, there's even some
adults who can't spell it.

17:15.599 --> 17:16.964
Of course.
Can you spell it?

17:18.640 --> 17:19.800
Try to spell it, Pam.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.040
Um...

17:21.280 --> 17:22.281
"A,"

17:23.800 --> 17:25.962
"X"? I don't...
You got me.

17:27.520 --> 17:28.521
Don't patronize me.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.366
I'm so sorry. I hate this.
You're better.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.729
Okay, we should go now.
Let's go.

17:33.800 --> 17:37.407
Wait, just... Just
waitjust a minute. Just watch.

17:43.320 --> 17:47.086
Wait, why are you... Oh. Are you
getting yourjollies right now?

17:47.680 --> 17:49.364
Can't get enough
of the show?

17:49.800 --> 17:51.086
Yourjollies
are all on fire.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.845
Please! It's Robert
who's enjoying it!

17:54.000 --> 17:55.081
What?

17:55.280 --> 17:56.930
This could be the affair
that you're scared of.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.490
Politicians are
wonderful liars.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.170
You never know
who they really are.

18:04.440 --> 18:07.523
But he's probably not gay.
He's straight.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.685
He's straight, so...

18:14.200 --> 18:16.567
Excuse me, could I get
some more water? No.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.447
Jan, you thought I had no
more cards left to play.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.363
Well, I've got one.
Man-Boy!

18:24.600 --> 18:26.682
The Ace of Babes.

18:26.800 --> 18:27.801
Oh, my God.

18:27.880 --> 18:28.961
Where's the Quiznos?

18:30.240 --> 18:32.481
You're the Quiznos.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.728
Jan, may I introduce
to you,

18:34.840 --> 18:37.127
your own personal
Dunder Mifflin liaison,

18:37.280 --> 18:41.649
devoted to servicing this account
with total client satisfaction.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.803
I sense that Molly

18:44.080 --> 18:46.560
wasn't quite
meeting your needs.

18:47.320 --> 18:50.881
Nothing like
your old assistant.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.564
Hunter,
was that his name?

18:55.200 --> 18:59.569
I... I don't recall.
And yes, Molly is crap.

18:59.720 --> 19:01.882
Okay, you do not
have to do this.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.448
Do what? Get into sales?
That's what I want.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.650
He's been growing
that mustache for weeks.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.281
Best he can do.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.371
So young.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.210
Will you...

19:16.280 --> 19:19.090
You. Can you
turn around for me, please?

19:22.040 --> 19:24.202
Dwight, you can go. I will
call you in a week or so

19:24.280 --> 19:26.169
and let you know whether
I want your business.

19:26.240 --> 19:27.241
Thank you.
Very good.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.610
Do you have
a valid passport?

19:36.920 --> 19:37.921
Jim Halpert.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.081
Hey, it's Colin.

19:39.160 --> 19:41.811
Hey, man.
lam so sorry about that.

19:41.960 --> 19:43.769
No, don't worry about it.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.961
It's just,
it's not totally working.

19:47.120 --> 19:50.966
Yeah, no, I know. This whole
telecommuting thing, not ideal.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.246
But don't worry,
I'll figure it out.

19:52.320 --> 19:55.961
Yeah, it's not just not ideal.
I mean, with you there,

19:56.040 --> 19:57.929
I don't know how
we're going to do this.

20:01.240 --> 20:02.969
What does...
What does that mean?

20:04.320 --> 20:06.288
Oscar, what is
happening here?

20:06.440 --> 20:08.966
Why would you say you think
the Senator might be gay?

20:09.040 --> 20:11.281
I don't know, Angela.
I'm dehydrated.

20:11.640 --> 20:14.530
Maybe you heard me wrong.
We should just go.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.687
Look, look, here he comes! Here he comes.
He's coming, he's coming.

20:21.560 --> 20:23.562
What is he doing? He's
making a phone call.

20:41.320 --> 20:44.403
Hey, Molly.
You should just quit.

20:44.560 --> 20:45.561
Yeah.
Yeah.

20:45.680 --> 20:46.681
Thanks.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.125
Oh, and Molly?

20:49.840 --> 20:53.606
I know it can't be easy working for Jan.
Good luck with your feelings.

20:56.920 --> 21:00.083
Dwight!
That was really nice.

21:00.440 --> 21:02.363
You should ask
for her number.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.806
I got her number.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.244
Four-one-five-Y-C-L.

21:06.800 --> 21:07.961
That's a license number?

21:08.120 --> 21:09.281
That's all you need.

21:09.360 --> 21:13.081
And when I have curried favor
with her, I will let you know.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.205
Why me?

21:15.280 --> 21:18.250
Because you are my friend
and you are a woman.

21:19.680 --> 21:23.287
And women love gossip.
It's like air to you people.

21:23.360 --> 21:26.364
Ugh. God!
