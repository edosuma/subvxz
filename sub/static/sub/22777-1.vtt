00:10.945 --> 00:12.611
No, I realize it's hard

00:12.680 --> 00:14.658
to place a new healthcare aide
around the holidays,

00:14.682 --> 00:17.049
but anything you have...

00:17.084 --> 00:18.884
[doorbell rings]

00:18.919 --> 00:20.419
Really, anything at all.

00:20.454 --> 00:21.620
I appreciate it.

00:21.689 --> 00:22.689
[knocking on door]

00:22.723 --> 00:24.423
Yes.
Thank you so much.

00:26.460 --> 00:27.460
Coming!

00:29.697 --> 00:31.063
Scout, homework.

00:31.098 --> 00:32.965
After this chapter.

00:33.034 --> 00:34.700
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.568
- Willa Fairchild?
- Yes?

00:36.604 --> 00:38.637
- Registered mail.
- Oh. Thank you.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.808
Buddy, I'm serious.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.743
Everyday Sam's
best friend's dog

00:44.779 --> 00:46.779
was kidnapped,

00:46.814 --> 00:49.948
and it's not the first one
in the neighborhood.

00:49.984 --> 00:50.984
What in the world?

00:53.721 --> 00:57.189
What's a Notice to Bene...?

00:57.224 --> 00:59.958
Beneficiaries
and Claimants.

01:00.027 --> 01:02.094
What does that mean?

01:02.129 --> 01:05.697
Mr. Conrad left me
something in his will.

01:05.733 --> 01:08.300
After he died?
What did he leave?

01:08.369 --> 01:10.235
[Man]:
A hundred thousand dollars?

01:10.271 --> 01:11.470
[Woman]:
Mm-hm.

01:11.539 --> 01:13.372
Who is this person?

01:13.407 --> 01:15.207
Her name is Willa Fairchild.

01:15.242 --> 01:18.043
She was Dad's nurse
during his last few months.

01:18.079 --> 01:21.747
And he left her
a hundred grand, and left us...

01:21.782 --> 01:25.617
Uh, "something much more
valuable than money."

01:25.653 --> 01:27.052
Finn...

01:28.255 --> 01:29.388
Finn?

01:29.423 --> 01:32.257
"Dear Willa,

01:32.293 --> 01:34.993
"I can't thank you enough
for everything you did for me.

01:35.062 --> 01:39.164
"You and Scout are very lucky
to have each other.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.900
"You made the right decision
to put your family first.

01:41.936 --> 01:44.103
"You gave your son
a second chance.

01:44.138 --> 01:46.572
Now it's your turn."

01:48.309 --> 01:49.942
This has to be
a mistake.

01:51.045 --> 01:52.644
Finn!

01:52.713 --> 01:54.646
Leaving us when we were kids
wasn't enough, huh?

01:54.715 --> 01:56.048
Never calling,
never reaching out,

01:56.083 --> 01:57.483
and now this?

01:57.551 --> 01:59.251
Look, I get it, okay?

01:59.286 --> 02:00.719
He didn't call
when he was sick.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.594
He didn't reach out.
He didn't want us to know.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.257
Or maybe she kept him
from reaching out.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.992
The nurse!

02:07.061 --> 02:08.138
He drew up
a brand-new will,

02:08.162 --> 02:10.461
days before he died,

02:10.497 --> 02:11.775
and he left the entire estate
to her?

02:11.799 --> 02:13.665
Come on, you hear

02:13.734 --> 02:15.745
about these caregivers taking
advantage of their patients

02:15.769 --> 02:16.835
all the time.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.237
Finn, I...

02:18.272 --> 02:19.771
What other explanation
could there be?

02:21.408 --> 02:24.576
That we were never in the will,
and we were never going to be.

02:24.612 --> 02:25.978
Look, Finn,

02:26.013 --> 02:27.557
there's something else
you need to know.

02:27.581 --> 02:30.282
It appears that our father
arranged for this nurse

02:30.317 --> 02:31.950
to have
an all-expense paid vacation

02:31.986 --> 02:33.763
to a bed and breakfast
called Bramble House in Oregon,

02:33.787 --> 02:35.921
two weeks
over Christmas.

02:35.956 --> 02:36.956
No.

02:37.758 --> 02:38.657
I...

02:38.692 --> 02:40.159
No. No.

02:40.227 --> 02:41.927
[starts car]

02:44.498 --> 02:45.797
"Don't wait
till it's too late

02:45.833 --> 02:47.099
"like I did

02:47.134 --> 02:48.667
"to figure out
what you want in life.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.269
"Be Scout's example.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.670
Promise me."

02:51.739 --> 02:52.739
What does that mean?

02:53.974 --> 02:55.407
It means

02:55.442 --> 02:56.962
that he's an incredibly
thoughtful man.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.478
What if...

02:59.513 --> 03:02.147
what if I'm not
all the way better yet?

03:02.183 --> 03:03.916
Okay, so the doctors said

03:03.951 --> 03:06.351
you can do anything you want
now, right?

03:06.420 --> 03:08.820
So we will just take it
at your speed.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.657
Look...

03:11.692 --> 03:14.960
maybe Mr. Conrad is right.

03:14.995 --> 03:19.164
We both got a second chance,
and we shouldn't waste it.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.133
Maybe this could be
the Christmas we deserve

03:21.168 --> 03:22.345
after everything
we've been through

03:22.369 --> 03:24.870
the last two years.

03:24.939 --> 03:26.705
What do you say?

03:27.875 --> 03:29.274
Yeah?

03:37.117 --> 03:39.251
[Finn]: Yeah, so,
I, uh, I talked to the lawyer,

03:39.286 --> 03:42.688
and she said that if we want
to contest the will,

03:42.756 --> 03:44.289
that we need to prove

03:44.325 --> 03:49.494
that the nurse used
"undue influence or deception"

03:49.530 --> 03:50.796
to get the money,

03:50.831 --> 03:52.164
and we need to do it

03:52.199 --> 03:54.199
before the end of the year,
December 31st.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.667
How would we do that?

03:55.703 --> 03:59.004
Well, I'm having her draw up
an injunction

03:59.039 --> 04:01.039
to stop the will
from getting paid out,

04:01.108 --> 04:03.342
and I'm going
to go confront this nurse

04:03.377 --> 04:05.277
and tell her to back off,

04:05.312 --> 04:07.312
or we will take her to court,
and we will win.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.114
Do you really want to do that?

04:09.149 --> 04:10.616
He's still our father.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.017
I mean,
don't we have to find out

04:12.052 --> 04:13.719
if this woman
was taking advantage of him?

04:14.989 --> 04:16.822
I can't rest

04:16.857 --> 04:20.692

and find out the truth.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.168
I'm going to be able
to answer it.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.825
No, I think you can.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.660
I think...

10:28.695 --> 10:29.695
Miss Fairchild...

10:31.298 --> 10:32.298
you...

10:32.332 --> 10:33.632
[Scout]:
Mom?

10:33.667 --> 10:35.667
Oh...

10:35.702 --> 10:37.035
Sweetheart...

10:37.104 --> 10:38.603
I woke up, and
I couldn't find you.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.105
[Willa]:
I'm so sorry.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.607
You were in a strange place
all by yourself.

10:42.643 --> 10:43.908
I'm sorry.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.477
Can I take you
back to bed?

10:45.512 --> 10:47.112
Okay.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.613
This is Finn.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.181
He's a new guest
at Bramble House.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.750
Can you say hi?

10:52.853 --> 10:54.986
Okay, let's go.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.855
Grab your stuff.
I'll show you your room.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.173
Scout?

11:17.210 --> 11:19.511
Scout?

11:26.687 --> 11:29.054
I didn't want to turn on
the light and wake you up.

11:29.122 --> 11:29.988
Ah.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.122
But Mom?

11:31.158 --> 11:32.457
Mm-hm?

11:33.427 --> 11:35.593
Was that guy from last night...

11:35.629 --> 11:37.295
was his full name
Finn Knightly?

11:38.198 --> 11:39.597
Yeah.

11:39.633 --> 11:40.498
He's the illustrator
of <i> Everyday Sam</i>!

11:40.534 --> 11:42.534
He's staying here?

11:42.602 --> 11:44.202
Can we ask him
about his next book?

11:44.271 --> 11:45.136
Maybe he'll be
at breakfast.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.172
Come on!

11:47.174 --> 11:48.174
Scout!

11:49.342 --> 11:50.842
Pajamas.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.048
[Scout]:
Mom! Look!

11:59.619 --> 12:00.518
[Willa laughs]

12:00.554 --> 12:02.120
Well, hi there.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.656
Mable said the town Santa
was staying here. Hi.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.124
Hi.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.992
Hi. I'm Willa,
and this is my son, Scout.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.060
Well, hiya, Scout.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.328
Nice to meet you.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.731
You know,
my real name is Ken.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.866
Did you know
that Santa had helpers

12:14.901 --> 12:16.167
all over the world

12:16.203 --> 12:17.736
collecting Christmas wishes
from kids?

12:17.804 --> 12:19.370
Oh!

12:19.406 --> 12:22.340
Well, my favorite thing
in the whole world to do

12:22.375 --> 12:24.008
is hear those wishes.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.310
You got yours yet?

12:25.345 --> 12:27.479
My Christmas wish
already came true.

12:27.514 --> 12:28.847
[Ken gasps]
Really?

12:28.882 --> 12:30.281
[Scout]:
But...

12:30.317 --> 12:32.984
maybe there's a few toys
I could add in?

12:33.019 --> 12:34.319
[laughs]

12:34.354 --> 12:35.954
Sure thing,

12:35.989 --> 12:37.100
and I'll get them
to the big guy,

12:37.124 --> 12:39.557
but here's
my question.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.392
Does anyone else smell bacon?

12:41.461 --> 12:43.528
[gasps]
Your favorite!

12:43.563 --> 12:44.563
Let's go get some.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.443
Mable, let me help
you with that.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.633
No, no, no, no,
I'm fine.

12:48.668 --> 12:50.168
Thank you for asking.

12:52.239 --> 12:55.206
Well, this is amazing.
Everything looks delicious.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.542
Can I get anybody
coffee? Tea?

12:57.577 --> 12:59.477
Marshmallows?

13:01.715 --> 13:03.882
We roasted some
last night, and...

13:03.917 --> 13:05.583
Did you put the garland
on the steps too?

13:05.652 --> 13:07.318
[Willa]:
I couldn't sleep.

13:07.354 --> 13:10.221
Fixing things up
relaxes me.

13:10.257 --> 13:11.189
I do the decorations,

13:11.224 --> 13:13.391
and the dessert.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.226
What you did
was very thoughtful.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.995
Don't do it again.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.596
[Willa]:
Yes, ma'am.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.535
She's tough.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.003
Ah...

13:26.306 --> 13:28.373
Not too tough.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.340
We grew up together.

13:29.376 --> 13:30.475
Oh...

13:30.510 --> 13:31.554
I've been
living in Portland

13:31.578 --> 13:33.311
for the last 20 years,

13:33.346 --> 13:35.547
but I always come back
to Bramble to be Santa.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.015
She's just mad

13:37.050 --> 13:39.250
that she hurt herself
ice skating.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.552
Ice skating?

13:40.587 --> 13:42.420
She told me horseback riding.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.221
Oh, she's always been
a slippery one.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.989
[Willa laughs]

13:45.025 --> 13:46.891
Hi! Good morning.
I'm Ken.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.560
Hey. Finn. Morning.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.195
Good morning!

13:50.230 --> 13:51.896
My son has discovered

13:51.932 --> 13:52.975
that you are
the illustrator

13:52.999 --> 13:55.400
of one
of his favorite books.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.502
He's a huge <i> Everyday Sam</i> fan.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.037
[chuckles]

13:59.072 --> 14:00.271
Is that so?

14:00.340 --> 14:02.240
I read
the first 10 books twice,

14:02.275 --> 14:04.242
and I'm on the 11th.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.277
Are you here

14:05.345 --> 14:06.611
working on
the next one?

14:06.680 --> 14:08.346
I am, um...

14:08.381 --> 14:10.748
actually, the one that
comes out next Christmas.

14:10.784 --> 14:12.650
Yeah.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.385
Um...

14:14.421 --> 14:18.523
I'm doing some sketching
later today in the park, um...

14:18.558 --> 14:20.258
if you'd like
to check it out?

14:20.327 --> 14:22.227
Oh, thank you,
but no.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.161
We're, um,
planning a...

14:23.196 --> 14:24.329
Mom!

14:24.364 --> 14:26.030
Mellow day.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.066
You guys don't want to miss
the Christmas Stroll.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.834
The Christmas Stroll?

14:29.870 --> 14:30.913
Mr. Conrad said
it was awesome.

14:30.937 --> 14:35.106
[Ken]: Yes,
and it starts today.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.875
And I can always use help

14:36.910 --> 14:40.044
with a stand-in for Sam
when I'm drawing.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.640
You'd actually be doing me
a huge favor.

14:41.681 --> 14:44.282
I get to be Sam?

14:44.351 --> 14:46.851
Well, I guess
we'll be joining you.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.255
Great.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.131
This place'll be great
for your book, right?

15:00.200 --> 15:02.433
Yeah!
It's beautiful.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.735
What should I do?

15:03.770 --> 15:04.869
Um...

15:04.905 --> 15:06.371
why don't you go stand

15:06.406 --> 15:07.338
with those carolers
over there?

15:07.374 --> 15:08.374
Pretend you're singing.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.841
Is it all right?

15:09.876 --> 15:12.543

You have a great job...

15:48.048 --> 15:49.714
getting to go
to beautiful places

15:49.749 --> 15:52.283
and always having
a way to record them.

15:52.319 --> 15:55.053
Yeah, it is.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.265
What about you?
What do you do?

15:56.289 --> 15:58.489
It's nothing as glamorous
as that.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.458
I've been working
as a health aide.

16:00.527 --> 16:01.926
[Finn]:
A nurse?

16:01.962 --> 16:03.861
[Willa]:
Not quite.

16:03.897 --> 16:07.799
I did all the coursework,
but, um, just...

16:07.867 --> 16:09.801
What, you didn't
want to finish?

16:12.072 --> 16:14.038
It's...
it's complicated.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.406
Yeah...

16:15.442 --> 16:17.075
I'm sorry,
I don't know your situation,

16:17.110 --> 16:18.576
so it must be...

16:18.611 --> 16:20.311
You must meet

16:20.380 --> 16:22.447
some pretty
interesting characters

16:22.482 --> 16:24.215
along the way, huh?

16:24.250 --> 16:25.283
Mm-hm.

16:25.318 --> 16:28.386
Any that stick out?

16:29.923 --> 16:31.289
I'm sorry,

16:31.324 --> 16:32.890
I can't really talk
about my patients.

16:32.926 --> 16:34.292
Oh, yeah, no.
Of course.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.794
I was just thinking
that, you know...

16:36.830 --> 16:39.998
they must really
depend on you

16:40.066 --> 16:41.132
and open up.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.600
Is it kind of like that?

16:44.170 --> 16:45.770
Mr. Knightly, I...

16:45.805 --> 16:47.772
I'm Finn, please,
and yeah, I know...

16:47.807 --> 16:49.340
I'm being nosy,

16:49.409 --> 16:51.342
but it's just kind of
part of my job description,

16:51.411 --> 16:52.588
kind of
to hear people's stories

16:52.612 --> 16:55.113
so I can portray them
in my work,

16:55.148 --> 16:55.913
and you do something
I don't know anything about,

16:55.949 --> 16:56.949
so...

17:01.321 --> 17:03.554
It is sort of like that.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.156
Um...

17:05.224 --> 17:08.259
everyone has a story,
and...

17:08.294 --> 17:10.560
when people are laid up
or they're hurting,

17:10.597 --> 17:14.232
and you get them
one on one,

17:14.267 --> 17:16.968
they do tend
to open up.

17:18.104 --> 17:20.671
What kind of stuff
do they say?

17:21.775 --> 17:22.807
[she laughs]

17:22.842 --> 17:24.242
I know. Okay.
I heard it.

17:24.277 --> 17:25.643
Um...

17:25.678 --> 17:28.012
Well, I just think

17:28.080 --> 17:29.747
that you seem like
the kind of person

17:29.783 --> 17:33.184
that, uh, a lot of people
would like to talk to.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.291
There's a chocolate shop
over there,

17:40.326 --> 17:42.260
and Mr. Conrad says

17:42.295 --> 17:43.161
they have the best
hot chocolate here.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.196
They do?

17:45.465 --> 17:47.565
Well, then
let's go get some!

17:47.600 --> 17:49.634
Um... it was
really nice

17:49.669 --> 17:50.768
talking with you.

17:50.804 --> 17:52.170
And you.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.771
Mr. Knightly's
not coming?

17:53.807 --> 17:56.074
Oh, no.
Call me Finn, please.

17:56.109 --> 17:57.909
Um...

17:57.944 --> 18:00.178
Well, I would love
a hot chocolate,

18:00.246 --> 18:02.914
if it's okay with...

18:02.949 --> 18:03.959
Yeah, please!
Come with us.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.650
Just let me...

18:20.867 --> 18:22.200
He's one of my mom's patients.

18:22.235 --> 18:23.201
Scout!

18:23.236 --> 18:24.068
What?

18:24.104 --> 18:26.204
He was really nice.

18:26.239 --> 18:28.406
There were a few days
when my childcare fell through,

18:28.441 --> 18:30.441
and he was
very understanding.

18:30.510 --> 18:31.709
We played cards,

18:31.744 --> 18:33.211
and he taught me
how to bet in poker.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.413
We also watched skating on TV.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.681
He loved speed skating.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.584
He loved skating.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.385
He did, huh?

18:41.421 --> 18:42.887
He wanted to teach me.

18:42.922 --> 18:45.089
He taught his son
when he was my age.

18:47.060 --> 18:49.894
And he's the one
that recommended this place?

18:49.929 --> 18:52.897
He spent
his first five Christmases here,

18:52.932 --> 18:55.700
and he had very fond memories.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.568
He's the one
who gave us this trip.

18:57.604 --> 18:58.870
Mm!

18:58.905 --> 19:00.938
It was a surprise
for me too.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.441
Scout has always wanted
to learn how to skate.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.910
I could teach him.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.712
Oh, I'm sorry,
that wasn't what I was saying.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.113
I just... um...

19:09.182 --> 19:10.381
No, no, both of you.

19:10.416 --> 19:11.949
Yeah, I mean,
I think I saw a rink

19:12.018 --> 19:13.518
by Bramble House,

19:13.553 --> 19:15.953
and I'm pretty sure
Mable loans out skates.

19:16.022 --> 19:16.921
So...

19:16.956 --> 19:17.956
Could we?

19:20.293 --> 19:22.426
Well, if Mr...

19:22.462 --> 19:25.229
if Finn has the time, then...

19:25.265 --> 19:28.032
Yes, I'd be
happy to. Yeah.

19:30.537 --> 19:31.836
Hey. I'm Sage.
I'm the owner.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.438
Nice to meet you.
You do amazing work.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.339
This is delicious.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.874
Oh, thank you.

19:36.910 --> 19:39.243
We just love it
when families come into town.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.279
Oh, we're not...
no.

19:41.347 --> 19:42.446
He belongs to me.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.714
Oh!

19:43.750 --> 19:44.682
[Finn]: Yeah,
I'm just tagging along

19:44.717 --> 19:46.184
for the sugar rush, so...

19:46.219 --> 19:47.785
[laughs]
Well, hey,

19:47.854 --> 19:50.054
while you're here,
you have got to try a sample

19:50.089 --> 19:51.367
of our famous
chocolate truffles.

19:51.391 --> 19:52.690
They are
to die for.

19:52.725 --> 19:53.624
Can I?

19:53.693 --> 19:55.059
Yes.

19:55.094 --> 19:56.094
Come with me.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.365
You know,
Scout has really loved

20:01.401 --> 20:03.134
your <i> Everyday Sam</i> books.

20:03.203 --> 20:06.370
A hero in everyday life...

20:06.406 --> 20:08.472
that's a great gift
to some kids.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.242
Wow. Thank you.

20:11.277 --> 20:12.810
Uh...

20:12.879 --> 20:15.313
it's nothing
like the hard work you do.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.982
Your patients
must be very grateful.

20:18.051 --> 20:20.484
Do all of them
give you gifts like this?

20:20.553 --> 20:23.654
Like this?
No. No, never.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.890
Why do you think
Mr. Conrad did?

20:25.925 --> 20:27.391
Well...

20:27.427 --> 20:29.727
because we connected.

20:29.762 --> 20:33.564
We shared things
about our life.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.733
We were close.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.134
Um...

20:37.203 --> 20:38.536
I don't know,

20:38.571 --> 20:40.404
maybe I should have
turned it down.

20:41.708 --> 20:42.807
Why did you take it?

20:44.911 --> 20:46.877
Honestly, because...

20:46.913 --> 20:50.615
it's been a very difficult
couple of years,

20:50.650 --> 20:51.749
and because
I promised him

20:51.784 --> 20:53.451
I would take
every chance I was given.

20:53.486 --> 20:54.719
What did the family think?

20:54.754 --> 20:58.122
You know,
they never reached out.

20:58.157 --> 20:59.890
I really wish they had.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.493
I could tell them
quite a lot, but, um...

21:02.562 --> 21:05.563
I'm not sure
they cared.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.265
Well,
you don't really know them.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.902
Do you?

21:11.938 --> 21:14.438
No. You're right.
I don't.

21:16.142 --> 21:17.475
I'm sorry, I...

21:17.510 --> 21:19.021
I really shouldn't have opened
that door,

21:19.045 --> 21:20.045
and that's on me.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.445
No, no.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.381
I get it.
I've been...

21:23.416 --> 21:25.283
No. Sorry.

21:25.318 --> 21:27.051
Um...

21:27.086 --> 21:28.486
I, uh...

21:28.554 --> 21:31.489
Yeah, I should go
finish up some work.

21:31.557 --> 21:32.735
I will see you back
at Bramble House.

21:32.759 --> 21:33.759
Finn...

21:35.128 --> 21:36.205
did I say something
to offend you?

21:36.229 --> 21:37.962
No, no, no, no.
It's all good.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.608
I just... I should finish up
these drawings,

21:39.632 --> 21:40.632
and, uh...

21:40.667 --> 21:42.633
I will see you later.

21:48.341 --> 21:49.273
[sister, on phone]:
<i>So you didn't tell her</i>

21:49.309 --> 21:50.309
<i>about the injunction?</i>

21:50.343 --> 21:51.776
<i>You didn't confront her?</i>

21:51.811 --> 21:53.455
Well, her son
stumbled out of bed last night

21:53.479 --> 21:55.246
when I was about to,

21:55.281 --> 21:56.847
and he's been with her
ever since.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.249
So she's a mom?

21:58.284 --> 21:59.817
<i>A single mom,
by the looks of it.</i>

21:59.852 --> 22:02.453
You know
her kid has met Dad too?

22:02.488 --> 22:03.966
I mean,
they watched skating together,

22:03.990 --> 22:05.289
<i>played cards...</i>

22:05.325 --> 22:06.624
<i>it was so hard
for me to hear.</i>

22:06.659 --> 22:07.591
So when are you going
to tell her

22:07.627 --> 22:09.593
about the injunction?

22:09.629 --> 22:10.961
<i>We're less
than two weeks out.</i>

22:10.997 --> 22:13.297
If we confront her
with the papers too soon,

22:13.333 --> 22:14.899
she's going to shut down,

22:14.934 --> 22:16.378
and then we won't get
the answers we need.

22:16.402 --> 22:18.936
<i>We need
a confession.</i>

22:18.971 --> 22:20.304
I will talk to the owner

22:20.340 --> 22:21.417
and see if I can get
an extra day or two,

22:21.441 --> 22:22.807
and then...

22:22.842 --> 22:23.941
<i>start down
this road.</i>

22:23.976 --> 22:26.077
Mols...

22:26.112 --> 22:28.346
don't worry, I got this.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.650
Hi.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.129
Could I buy a small box
of those chocolate truffles?

22:34.153 --> 22:35.419
Oh. Of course.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.521
I want to get a gift
as a thank you

22:37.590 --> 22:38.989
for the owner
of Bramble House.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.858
Oh, you two are staying
at Bramble House?

22:40.927 --> 22:41.959
That's my aunt's place.

22:41.994 --> 22:42.927
Mable is your aunt?

22:42.962 --> 22:44.628
Mm-hm.

22:44.664 --> 22:47.798
Well, I was thinking
of getting her some ornaments.

22:47.834 --> 22:50.267
Oh. Oh, she won't like that
at all.

22:50.303 --> 22:51.836
[laughs]
She's a little controlling.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.437
Oh, I'll say.

22:53.473 --> 22:56.273
She likes everything
just the way she likes it.

22:56.309 --> 22:57.875
She still mad she
hurt herself sledding?

22:57.944 --> 22:59.710
Sledding now?

22:59.779 --> 23:01.090
You know,
I think I like your aunt

23:01.114 --> 23:01.979
more and more every day.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.114
[laughs]

23:04.350 --> 23:05.761
You know, my daughter and I
were headed out

23:05.785 --> 23:07.351
to do some errands.

23:07.420 --> 23:09.064
She's about your son's age.
Do you want some company?

23:09.088 --> 23:10.121
That'd be nice.

23:10.156 --> 23:11.156
Cool.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.493
Oh, hey, Finn.

23:15.528 --> 23:16.528
Hey.

23:16.596 --> 23:17.928
Uh, did I hear

23:17.964 --> 23:19.864
that you're a children's
book illustrator?

23:19.932 --> 23:20.932
Yeah, that's right.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.033
Because every Christmas Eve,

23:23.102 --> 23:24.802
I do a reading
for the kids in town

23:24.837 --> 23:27.104
from
<i>The Night Before Christmas,</i>

23:27.140 --> 23:29.039
and we try
to get a special guest for them.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.474
Interested in that?

23:30.510 --> 23:32.042
Oh, thanks,

23:32.111 --> 23:33.188
but I'm not going to be here
through Christmas Eve.

23:33.212 --> 23:34.612
Home for the holidays.
Family.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.714
Right. Of course.
Well, maybe another time.

23:36.783 --> 23:37.783
Sure.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.285
What about Bramble House?

23:41.320 --> 23:43.521
Has it always been
a B&B?

23:43.556 --> 23:44.722
Actually, it was
a family home

23:44.791 --> 23:46.357
for generations.

23:46.392 --> 23:49.627
Mable was living there
till the recession hit.

23:49.662 --> 23:51.162
They almost put it up
for sale.

23:51.197 --> 23:54.632
She single-handedly saved it
by turning it into a B&B.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.587
Honestly, I don't know how
she does it all alone.

23:56.636 --> 23:59.136
Mom, look,
it's Finn's book!

23:59.172 --> 24:00.838
Can I go in
and show Savannah?

24:00.873 --> 24:02.840
Of course!
Sure.

24:06.345 --> 24:07.378

24:07.447 --> 24:08.846
♪ ...And a Happy New Year ♪

24:08.881 --> 24:10.714
There they are!

24:12.385 --> 24:14.718
He likes that Finn.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.488
And you?
You guys seem pretty friendly.

24:17.523 --> 24:19.290
Uh...

24:19.325 --> 24:21.125
Oh, sorry.
Just kick me.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.860
I blurt things out.

24:22.895 --> 24:24.528
Look! That's my friend.

24:24.564 --> 24:25.963
Really?

24:25.998 --> 24:27.631
Yeah, and he's here
writing a new book.

24:27.667 --> 24:30.034
You're the opposite.
Private?

24:30.069 --> 24:32.570
Um, I used to be.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.839
Yeah, I'm trying not to
anymore.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.207
Just, you know,

24:36.242 --> 24:38.342
don't want
to miss the world.

24:41.581 --> 24:43.714
These are so beautiful.

24:43.749 --> 24:45.316
Yeah.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.188
You know what?

24:51.224 --> 24:54.892
I think we're going to try
a little homemade magic.

24:54.961 --> 24:55.961
Hey, Scout?

24:57.063 --> 24:58.063
Come here.

24:58.130 --> 24:59.497
Let's go.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.502
Look at all those presents.

25:04.537 --> 25:05.569
Yeah.

25:05.638 --> 25:06.971
I bet Mable
is going to try

25:07.006 --> 25:08.706
to get all of them in
herself, too.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.674
We should help.

25:10.710 --> 25:11.742
Good idea.

25:11.811 --> 25:14.745
[door closes, footsteps enter]

25:14.814 --> 25:15.814
What are you doing?

25:15.848 --> 25:17.414
Helping!

25:17.483 --> 25:18.827
We saw these
sitting in your trunk,

25:18.851 --> 25:20.184
and thought
we would help out

25:20.219 --> 25:21.085
by bringing them in.

25:21.153 --> 25:23.354
I just dropped off a batch

25:23.389 --> 25:25.155
and then was going
to head back out.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.324
Oh, okay.
Well...

25:27.360 --> 25:28.871
I'm so sorry.
I should have asked first.

25:28.895 --> 25:31.328
Um, that was my mistake.

25:31.364 --> 25:33.030
But since
they're all inside

25:33.065 --> 25:34.532
now...

25:34.567 --> 25:36.834
Yup.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.402
Right there
under the tree.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.813
If you ever need
anything else,

25:49.849 --> 25:50.814
or want anything else,

25:50.850 --> 25:52.883
just feel free
to ask us...

25:52.919 --> 25:54.351
never mind.

25:54.387 --> 25:55.819
Willa...

25:55.855 --> 25:56.887
thank you.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.422
You're welcome.

26:02.395 --> 26:04.662
Can we make
gingerbread houses now?

26:04.697 --> 26:07.097
[loud whisper] Uh, as long
as Mable doesn't see.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.167
[Scout]:
Hey, Finn!

26:10.202 --> 26:11.936
Want to make gingerbread houses
with us?

26:12.004 --> 26:13.404
[Willa]: Oh, no,
that's okay.

26:13.439 --> 26:14.672
We don't want
to disturb you.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.340
No...

26:16.375 --> 26:18.409
Actually, I would love to,

26:18.444 --> 26:20.010
but I've got
to warn you,

26:20.046 --> 26:21.712
I'm a gingerbread house
champion.

26:21.747 --> 26:22.513
Are you really?

26:22.548 --> 26:23.681
Mm-hm. Yep.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.215
Oh, well,
we will see about that,

26:25.251 --> 26:27.918
because I think
you may have met your match.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.353
Is that so?

26:29.388 --> 26:32.389
Well, game on, good sir.

26:34.026 --> 26:36.594
Mom,
isn't this one great?

26:36.629 --> 26:38.362
You guys
are amazing.

26:38.397 --> 26:39.597
You see, this
is what happens

26:39.665 --> 26:40.742
when you put two
gingerbread experts

26:40.766 --> 26:42.232
together.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.667
Yeah, it is.

26:43.703 --> 26:44.935
Mine, on
the other hand,

26:45.004 --> 26:46.403
is, um...

26:46.439 --> 26:47.905
having some
trouble.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.718
- Can I give you a hand?
- This is not staying.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.053
- I think I see the problem.
- Yes, please.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.043
- Okay.
- Oh, it just keeps sliding.

26:53.079 --> 26:56.680
A little extra icing
up on top there...

26:56.716 --> 26:59.216
There we go,
and then...

26:59.251 --> 27:00.451
just...

27:00.519 --> 27:01.719
That's what I did.

27:01.754 --> 27:02.764
No, I know,
but you want to hold it up

27:02.788 --> 27:03.921
at the top,

27:03.956 --> 27:05.255
and hold it
until it dries.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.590
Okay. Thank you.

27:06.626 --> 27:07.725
[laughs]

27:09.028 --> 27:10.427
Yeah. Um...

27:12.698 --> 27:14.298
Sorry I left so abruptly
earlier.

27:14.367 --> 27:16.233
I'm the one
who invited you into town,

27:16.268 --> 27:17.234
and it was...

27:17.269 --> 27:18.969
No, it's...

27:19.038 --> 27:20.738
It was nice.
I'm glad we came.

27:20.773 --> 27:22.206
Good...

27:22.241 --> 27:24.274
and so you two are staying
through Christmas?

27:24.310 --> 27:25.776
New Year's,

27:25.811 --> 27:28.312
and then
it's back to reality.

27:28.381 --> 27:29.381
What's reality?

27:29.415 --> 27:30.648
Scout goes back to school,

27:30.716 --> 27:34.518
and hopefully
I have a new job by then

27:34.553 --> 27:35.713
because money has been tight.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.889
I thought
you just finished a job.

27:38.924 --> 27:41.558
Well, we've...
had some extra expenses

27:41.594 --> 27:42.693
this year.

27:42.728 --> 27:43.694
What kind?

27:43.729 --> 27:45.596
[laughs]

27:45.631 --> 27:46.964
I know...

27:47.033 --> 27:49.033
I'm sorry.
I tell you what...

27:49.068 --> 27:50.601
why don't you ask me
anything,

27:50.636 --> 27:52.403
and I will answer.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.304
What's the new plot
of the <i> Everyday Sam</i> book?

27:54.373 --> 27:55.472
Except that.

27:55.541 --> 27:56.740
Ah, I am sworn
to secrecy,

27:56.776 --> 27:58.976
but I'll tell you what,

27:59.045 --> 28:01.712
the town carriage ride
starts in an hour,

28:01.747 --> 28:03.981
and I actually need
to draw Sam

28:04.050 --> 28:05.416
near horses,

28:05.451 --> 28:06.862
'cause he rides a horse
in the next book,

28:06.886 --> 28:08.118
so I was wondering

28:08.154 --> 28:10.120
if you would want
another modeling gig?

28:10.156 --> 28:11.622
Are you...?

28:11.657 --> 28:14.158
Mom, we're going on a
carriage ride right now!

28:14.226 --> 28:15.826
If it's all right.

28:17.430 --> 28:18.740
I guess we're going
on a carriage ride.

28:18.764 --> 28:20.764
Excellent.

28:22.068 --> 28:22.966
Finish this up.

28:23.002 --> 28:24.002
Okay.

28:30.843 --> 28:32.342
♪ O Christmas tree ♪

28:32.411 --> 28:34.912
♪ O Christmas tree ♪

28:34.947 --> 28:37.681
♪ Your leaves
are so unchanging ♪

28:37.750 --> 28:39.183
We're next.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.417
I can't wait.

28:40.453 --> 28:41.630
This is going
to be so much fun.

28:41.654 --> 28:44.188
Can I go say hi?

28:44.256 --> 28:46.156
Yes, just stay
with Savannah

28:46.192 --> 28:48.459
and stay right where
I can see you, okay?

28:48.494 --> 28:51.361
Don't worry, Mom.
I got this.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.097
He's a great kid.

28:53.132 --> 28:54.631
[Willa]: He's really
over the moon

28:54.667 --> 28:57.134
that you've taken
an interest.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.303
Well, I like him.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.707
Have you ever seen
anything like this town?

29:03.776 --> 29:05.943
[carriage assistant]:
Next up!

29:05.978 --> 29:06.978
[Finn]:
You're up, bud!

29:14.987 --> 29:15.987
[Willa]:
Hey, Scout.

29:17.423 --> 29:20.357
Look around you,
and then close your eyes.

29:20.426 --> 29:21.859
Okay, put everything
you just saw

29:21.927 --> 29:24.294
into your brain
like a picture.

29:24.330 --> 29:26.830
That way, you can keep it,
even after we've gone.

29:26.866 --> 29:29.199
Okay, now, open 'em.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.701
It belongs to you now.

29:39.812 --> 29:41.712
[Willa]:
It's been so long

29:41.781 --> 29:44.681
since I've seen Scout
having such a wonderful time,

29:44.717 --> 29:46.461
and now you're drawing
a custom portrait of him

29:46.485 --> 29:47.451
with Santa.

29:47.486 --> 29:48.566
[Ken, as Santa]:
Ho, ho, ho!

29:48.621 --> 29:51.054
Merry Christmas!

29:51.123 --> 29:53.357
[Willa]: Scout would
lose his mind

29:53.392 --> 29:54.658
if some version
of that

29:54.693 --> 29:56.193
ended up in
<i>Everyday Sam</i>.

29:56.228 --> 29:57.494
Can I tell you my wish?

29:57.530 --> 29:59.797
No, because then
it won't come true.

29:59.832 --> 30:02.499
That's only birthdays.
I wished...

30:02.535 --> 30:04.401
La la la la la...

30:04.470 --> 30:05.636
Can I tell you, then?

30:05.671 --> 30:07.070
Yeah, sure, why not.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.659
[whispering]
I want to stay in Bramble.

30:09.708 --> 30:11.608
Oh...

30:11.644 --> 30:13.477
Okay, well, now
I want to know.

30:13.512 --> 30:16.280
Too late.
Now tell me yours.

30:16.315 --> 30:19.883
Oh, well, I haven't made
a Christmas wish

30:19.952 --> 30:21.685
for quite some time.

30:21.720 --> 30:24.288
Well, you are going to have
to get started on that soon.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.989
That's what Christmas
is for,

30:26.025 --> 30:28.959
to remind us
that wishes can come true.

30:30.696 --> 30:32.196
[laughs]

30:33.365 --> 30:35.065
[Scout]:
So skating tomorrow?

30:35.134 --> 30:36.667
And maybe make a snowman,
and...

30:36.702 --> 30:38.302
What?

30:38.337 --> 30:40.070
You want to do
all of that in one day?

30:40.139 --> 30:41.405
I want to do everything now.

30:41.473 --> 30:42.713
The doctors said
go at my speed.

30:42.741 --> 30:44.341
Maybe my speed is changing.

30:44.376 --> 30:45.909
It's really cool

30:45.978 --> 30:49.746
that Finn Knightly wants
to teach me how to skate.

30:49.815 --> 30:51.175
He's really, really nice,
isn't he?

30:52.051 --> 30:53.750
He really, really is.

30:55.654 --> 30:57.721
Okay, get some sleep.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.657
How am I supposed
to sleep now?

31:00.693 --> 31:02.559
I'm going to be
right across the hall,

31:02.595 --> 31:04.695
in the library, okay?

31:04.730 --> 31:06.163
Hey, buddy...

31:06.198 --> 31:08.465
are you sure
you don't want to tell me

31:08.500 --> 31:10.133
what your
Christmas wish was?

31:10.169 --> 31:13.370
I want stay here longer...
for as long as we can.

31:13.405 --> 31:15.672
It is pretty great, right?

31:15.708 --> 31:17.374
It's the best place
I ever came to.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.544
I love you, Scout.
Good night.

31:20.579 --> 31:21.645
Good night.

31:39.398 --> 31:40.597
You look cozy.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.201
Sorry. I didn't mean
to startle you.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.936
I was just going to...

31:46.005 --> 31:46.937
do you mind?

31:47.006 --> 31:48.538
Of course.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.847
Job market.
Slim pickings.

31:56.882 --> 31:58.081
Yeah.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.516
Do you ever think

31:59.551 --> 32:01.718
about going back
and finishing your degree?

32:01.754 --> 32:04.655
Yeah, I just don't think
that'd be right for me.

32:04.690 --> 32:05.756
Right, yeah...

32:05.824 --> 32:07.991
I guess managing
school and work

32:08.027 --> 32:10.227
would be pretty hard, huh?

32:10.262 --> 32:12.262
And I guess...

32:12.331 --> 32:14.665
Scout's dad
isn't in the picture?

32:14.700 --> 32:16.867
Well, we divorced
a few years ago,

32:16.902 --> 32:18.402
and now he's a...

32:18.437 --> 32:21.038
birthday and Christmas card
kind of dad.

32:22.942 --> 32:26.777
You said that you and
your dad weren't close.

32:26.845 --> 32:28.412
Was he in your life?

32:29.915 --> 32:31.281
Uh...

32:31.350 --> 32:33.884
he was until I was 10,
and then...

32:33.919 --> 32:35.719
he disappeared
two days after Christmas

32:35.754 --> 32:37.187
one year.

32:38.557 --> 32:39.790
The end.

32:39.858 --> 32:42.292
And you never saw him again?

32:43.595 --> 32:44.595
No.

32:45.864 --> 32:47.064
That's so sad.

32:48.801 --> 32:49.733
Is that
kind of what happened

32:49.768 --> 32:51.401
with Scout's dad?
He...?

32:51.437 --> 32:53.003
Um...

32:53.038 --> 32:54.705
it was more gradual.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.340
I'm just still trying
to figure out

32:56.375 --> 32:59.009
how to help Scout through it.

33:01.880 --> 33:04.047
If you don't mind...

33:04.083 --> 33:05.582
what helped you?

33:05.617 --> 33:09.419
Oh, um, my mom, my sister...
yeah, um...

33:09.455 --> 33:12.422
a decent stepdad,
and, uh...

33:13.692 --> 33:15.092
and my art, yeah.

33:15.127 --> 33:17.027
You do what you love.

33:17.062 --> 33:18.095
Mm.

33:18.130 --> 33:19.796
You don't love your job?

33:19.865 --> 33:23.100
I love the people I've met.

33:23.135 --> 33:26.203
Really, it was Mr. Conrad
who affected me the most,

33:26.238 --> 33:29.373
because he showed me
that it's okay

33:29.408 --> 33:32.075
to want a rewarding
life for myself.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.111
He said that?

33:33.145 --> 33:34.978
He said so many things.

33:36.448 --> 33:39.616
I think the thing
that stuck with me the most

33:39.651 --> 33:43.253
is that I'm Scout's example
of how to live,

33:43.288 --> 33:45.055
and he encouraged me
to do a better job of it

33:45.090 --> 33:47.124
than he did with
his own children.

33:52.131 --> 33:54.698
Oh, look at that.

33:55.567 --> 33:56.567
Oh!

33:56.602 --> 33:58.935
It's snowing.

33:58.971 --> 34:00.604
It's beautiful.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.707
Let's go grab our coats.

34:06.645 --> 34:08.378
Can I ask...

34:08.414 --> 34:09.880
why do you keep asking

34:09.915 --> 34:12.882
about Mr. Conrad
and my work?

34:12.918 --> 34:15.385
Am I?

34:15.420 --> 34:18.922
I just feel like you want
to hear something bad

34:18.956 --> 34:20.424
about it, or about me.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.259
Oh, no, no.
I...

34:22.293 --> 34:25.896
I think
I'm just all out of sorts

34:25.931 --> 34:28.598
with what's going on
in my own life.

34:28.634 --> 34:31.068
I really...

34:31.103 --> 34:34.137
wanted to say some things
to my dad,

34:34.172 --> 34:37.741
and I just really wish...

34:37.775 --> 34:41.578
yeah, it's...
and now it's too late.

34:41.612 --> 34:45.549
I could listen to
what you wanted to say.

34:45.583 --> 34:46.817
That can be
very healing,

34:46.885 --> 34:48.819
and I'm here.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.089
Wow, that's...

34:52.123 --> 34:55.958
No wonder people
open up to you,

34:55.994 --> 34:57.828
tell you their secrets...

34:57.896 --> 35:01.164
I mean, being there for people,
that's what you love.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.901
I don't know
if it's that simple.

35:04.937 --> 35:06.169
What if it is?

35:06.238 --> 35:07.938
It's yours to choose.

35:07.973 --> 35:09.773
What's holding you back?

35:15.614 --> 35:18.281
Um, Scout might wake up

35:18.317 --> 35:20.350
and wonder where I am,

35:20.419 --> 35:21.618
and you need to work.

35:21.653 --> 35:23.320
I'm sorry
if I said the wrong thing.

35:23.355 --> 35:24.788
You didn't.
You didn't.

35:24.823 --> 35:27.524
You said incredibly nice things.

35:32.131 --> 35:33.430
Look, if you meant it

35:33.465 --> 35:36.733
about teaching Scout
how to skate,

35:36.768 --> 35:38.935
and me...

35:38.971 --> 35:39.971
I'd like that.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.507
I would be happy to.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.109
Tomorrow morning?

35:46.145 --> 35:48.278
And you.

35:48.313 --> 35:49.179
Okay.

35:49.248 --> 35:50.248
Okay.

35:50.282 --> 35:52.149
Night, Finn.

35:53.418 --> 35:54.918
Good night.

36:02.461 --> 36:03.426
Good night.

36:03.462 --> 36:05.128
Night.

36:39.164 --> 36:40.530
[loud clatter]

36:40.599 --> 36:42.299
[Mable]:
Where the heck is that pan?

36:42.334 --> 36:43.334
Excuse me?

36:44.636 --> 36:46.937
I'm not here to help
or anything, don't worry.

36:46.972 --> 36:49.506
Um, you said
there were ice skates,

36:49.541 --> 36:50.473
so if you could just tell me
where they are...

36:50.509 --> 36:51.675
then...

36:53.011 --> 36:54.811
Of course
you can't just tell me.

36:57.349 --> 36:59.182
[Mable]: Okay,

36:59.218 --> 37:01.618
if you tell me your sizes,
then I can find them for you.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.520
I can take it from here.

37:03.555 --> 37:04.521
There she is.

37:04.556 --> 37:05.989
So, Mable,

37:06.024 --> 37:08.358
we're still on for that catch-up
over coffee?

37:08.393 --> 37:09.726
Oh...

37:09.795 --> 37:11.294
I'm sor...
I can't.

37:11.330 --> 37:13.830
I have the dishes,
I have recycling,

37:13.865 --> 37:15.799
and I have a handyman
coming at 11:00.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.968
Actually, Scout
can handle the recycling,

37:18.003 --> 37:20.604
and we will be done skating
by 11:00,

37:20.639 --> 37:22.539
so I can wait
for the handyman.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.252
Look, I know you like
to do everything yourself,

37:24.276 --> 37:25.809
but you have to admit

37:25.844 --> 37:28.612
that when I have helped,
it's been useful,

37:28.647 --> 37:30.013
so why not let me do it?

37:30.048 --> 37:31.348
I'm fine, really. I...

37:31.383 --> 37:32.782
Ms. Bramble,

37:32.818 --> 37:34.351
I have had
half a dozen patients

37:34.386 --> 37:36.519
who won't admit
they need time to recover.

37:36.555 --> 37:38.154
They sound just like you.

37:38.190 --> 37:41.057
Now, I think

37:41.126 --> 37:42.525
that you should go
and have coffee

37:42.561 --> 37:43.860
with the man

37:43.895 --> 37:45.306
who has been coming here
for 22 years,

37:45.330 --> 37:46.774
and I'm paid
through the end of the week,

37:46.798 --> 37:49.232
so you can't throw me out
for saying all of that.

37:50.335 --> 37:51.568
Fine.

37:52.537 --> 37:53.470
Fine? That's it?

37:53.505 --> 37:54.471
Yes.

37:54.506 --> 37:55.338
Okay.
Okay, then.

37:55.374 --> 37:56.473
Well, go get ready.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.341
No more ordering around.

38:00.045 --> 38:01.244
Quick!

38:01.313 --> 38:02.912
Go before
she changes her mind.

38:02.981 --> 38:04.014
Willa, thank you.

38:04.049 --> 38:06.349
What are Christmas wishes for?

38:10.722 --> 38:12.622
Hey! Found 'em.

38:21.466 --> 38:22.799
Like night time
during the day.

38:22.834 --> 38:24.267
Okay, here we go.

38:24.303 --> 38:25.702
Shoulders back,
and then relax.

38:25.771 --> 38:27.337
Just sit in it.
Now, bend those knees.

38:27.372 --> 38:28.438
[grunts]
Gorilla!

38:28.473 --> 38:29.806
Yeah,
loosen it up.

38:29.841 --> 38:31.007
[laughs]

38:31.043 --> 38:32.275
What are you
laughing at?

38:32.311 --> 38:33.476
You're up
next, gorilla.

38:33.512 --> 38:36.046
Just teach one beginner
at a time.

38:36.114 --> 38:38.181
Ah ah,
we're all in this together.

38:38.216 --> 38:40.517
So, make the pizza for me.

38:40.552 --> 38:43.453
Then we're going to go
pizza, pizza, glide.

38:43.488 --> 38:45.522
French fries,
all right?

38:45.557 --> 38:46.523
Step...

38:46.558 --> 38:47.524
step...

38:47.559 --> 38:48.658
glide!

38:48.694 --> 38:50.860
There you go. Good.
You got it.

38:50.896 --> 38:53.563
Oh! Scout! Are you okay?

38:55.233 --> 38:56.399
That was amazing.

38:56.468 --> 38:57.834
Kid's a natural.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.669
Lesson one of ice skating,
falling down.

38:59.705 --> 39:00.937
Lesson number two,

39:00.972 --> 39:02.505
getting back up.
There you go, buddy.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.352
All right, give me
that pizza, pizza, french fries.

39:04.376 --> 39:06.309
Push, push, glide.

39:10.315 --> 39:11.481
Okay, okay.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.550
Now the fun part.
You got this.

39:13.618 --> 39:14.517
Hold on tight.

39:14.553 --> 39:15.785
Okay.

39:15.821 --> 39:17.153
Huh? So now just push.

39:17.189 --> 39:18.488
Mm-hm. Got it.

39:18.523 --> 39:19.489
You...

39:19.524 --> 39:20.657
Ooh!

39:20.692 --> 39:21.858
There you go.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.026
- I got... Whoa!
- Whoa!

39:23.061 --> 39:23.960
[both laughing]

39:23.995 --> 39:24.995
Come on, you got this.

39:25.964 --> 39:26.863
[Finn]:
Nice.

39:26.898 --> 39:27.964
Oh, there we go!

39:27.999 --> 39:30.233
Yeah!
Nice and gentle.

39:30.302 --> 39:31.234
This is fun!

39:31.303 --> 39:32.669
I know!
Look at you.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.704
Olympics, here you come.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.639
There's your new job.

39:36.675 --> 39:38.508
Whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa!

39:38.543 --> 39:39.543
Oh!

39:40.846 --> 39:42.011
[both laugh]

39:42.047 --> 39:43.580
Olympics, there I go.

39:43.648 --> 39:44.547
Yeah, you okay?

39:44.583 --> 39:45.648
Yes.

39:45.684 --> 39:47.150
You've got
a little, uh...

39:50.822 --> 39:52.689
Sorry, my hands are cold.

39:56.528 --> 39:57.961
[Scout]: Look at me!
I'm flying!

40:00.298 --> 40:01.164
[Willa]:
You're amazing!

40:01.199 --> 40:02.298
Go, go, go!

40:05.904 --> 40:08.405
Oh, do you know
what time it is?

40:08.473 --> 40:10.673
I promised Mable I would
be back at the house by 11:00

40:10.709 --> 40:12.475
for the handyman.

40:12.511 --> 40:14.577
Honey, we've got to go, okay?

40:14.646 --> 40:15.712
Now?

40:15.747 --> 40:17.647
Please, Mom,
can I stay?

40:17.682 --> 40:18.548
Look, I'll stay with him.

40:18.583 --> 40:19.583
No...

40:19.651 --> 40:20.917
No, I'd like to.

40:20.986 --> 40:22.296
Yeah, we'll skate around
for a bit,

40:22.320 --> 40:23.464
and then I'll take him
through town.

40:23.488 --> 40:24.728
You take some time
for yourself.

40:25.991 --> 40:28.391
A mom's vacation,
you don't get.

40:29.995 --> 40:30.927
- Go.
- Okay.

40:30.996 --> 40:32.595
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

40:32.664 --> 40:33.863
- Great.
- Okay!

40:33.899 --> 40:34.931
Yeah.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.567
There you go.
Look at this.

40:37.602 --> 40:38.935
Look at your mom!

40:41.239 --> 40:42.505
That's pretty good, huh?

41:05.931 --> 41:07.430
[doorbell rings]

41:14.773 --> 41:16.005
Hi!

41:16.041 --> 41:16.906
Hi!

41:16.942 --> 41:17.841
Sage!

41:17.876 --> 41:19.209
Thank you.

41:20.612 --> 41:21.878
Where's Aunt Mable?

41:21.913 --> 41:23.880
She's in town.
What are you doing here?

41:23.915 --> 41:25.882
She forgot
about the cookie bake?

41:28.119 --> 41:29.586
Hmm.

41:30.755 --> 41:32.255
Well, it's our annual tradition

41:32.290 --> 41:34.057
to make cookies
for the book reading

41:34.092 --> 41:35.892
on Christmas Eve.

41:35.927 --> 41:37.227
It's also our tradition

41:37.262 --> 41:39.596
to eat several dozen
while we make them,

41:39.631 --> 41:41.431
but no Mable?

41:41.500 --> 41:42.565
That's on me.

41:42.601 --> 41:44.000
I sent her off

41:44.035 --> 41:46.436
to have her annual
coffee with Ken.

41:46.505 --> 41:48.771
Santa Ken, huh?

41:48.840 --> 41:50.240
Okay, wait...

41:50.275 --> 41:51.875
you see it too?

41:51.910 --> 41:53.543
He's had a crush on my aunt
for 20 years.

41:53.578 --> 41:55.345
She has no idea?

41:55.380 --> 41:57.058
I don't think Ken's
ever worked the nerve up

41:57.082 --> 41:58.248
to tell her.

41:58.283 --> 42:00.183
Or maybe your aunt's too scary.

42:00.218 --> 42:02.385
[laughs]
Savannah's coming over later.

42:02.420 --> 42:03.520
Where's Scout?

42:03.555 --> 42:05.355
With Finn.
In fact,

42:05.390 --> 42:06.289
they are probably
at your chocolate shop

42:06.358 --> 42:07.457
right now.

42:07.526 --> 42:09.526
With Finn, huh?

42:15.934 --> 42:19.068
How do you draw
those things in the books?

42:19.104 --> 42:21.271
How do I draw
those things in books?

42:21.306 --> 42:22.739
Well...

42:22.774 --> 42:24.285
I learned a few secrets
a long time ago

42:24.309 --> 42:25.475
from a very special teacher.

42:25.544 --> 42:26.876
Basically,

42:26.912 --> 42:29.279
all it is,
is modified shapes, okay?

42:29.314 --> 42:30.980
So if I'm
doing a face,

42:31.049 --> 42:32.549
we start off
with, like, a nice...

42:32.584 --> 42:34.784
just rough in an oval
like that.

42:34.853 --> 42:36.386
Two little ovals
for the eyes,

42:36.421 --> 42:38.054
and then an open triangle
for the nose,

42:38.089 --> 42:41.257
and then a little line
for the mouth, and then...

42:41.293 --> 42:44.260
you kind of just go all crazy
for the hair, like that,

42:44.296 --> 42:45.428
and then...

42:45.463 --> 42:47.130
here it is!

42:47.198 --> 42:48.631
Give it a title.

42:49.968 --> 42:53.069
Every piece of art
has a title or a caption,

42:53.104 --> 42:54.871
so, what do you think
it should be called?

42:54.906 --> 42:55.906
Hmm...

42:55.941 --> 42:57.206
"Scout Loves Chocolate?"

42:57.242 --> 42:59.642
Scout Loves Chocolate!

42:59.711 --> 43:01.444
Truth in art!

43:01.479 --> 43:03.446
Sounds perfect.

43:03.481 --> 43:05.315
There you go. All done.

43:06.785 --> 43:07.785
Whoop!

43:07.819 --> 43:09.752
Whoa!
There you go.

43:09.788 --> 43:10.720
For me?

43:10.755 --> 43:11.621
You bet.

43:11.656 --> 43:12.455
Can you do another one?

43:12.490 --> 43:13.656
Sure.

43:13.725 --> 43:14.735
What would
you like to see?

43:14.759 --> 43:16.793
How about...
me skating?

43:16.828 --> 43:19.662
You skating?
Sounds good.

43:19.731 --> 43:21.631
Why did you want to
learn about skating?

43:21.666 --> 43:25.401
Was it because of
talking to Mr. Conrad?

43:25.437 --> 43:27.170
Well, I've always
wanted to learn,

43:27.205 --> 43:29.205
but he told me
a lot about it,

43:29.240 --> 43:31.074
and he was really smart,

43:31.109 --> 43:33.109
and he told me funny stories.

43:33.144 --> 43:36.279
Yeah?
What kind of stories?

43:36.314 --> 43:39.115
About places he went,
people he met...

43:39.150 --> 43:41.951
and funny things his kids did
when they were my age.

43:43.888 --> 43:45.388
Yeah, like what?
What kind of things?

43:45.423 --> 43:47.824
He showed me
some ornaments they made...

43:47.892 --> 43:50.793
but I think
Christmas made him sad.

43:52.263 --> 43:53.496
Oh yeah?

43:53.565 --> 43:55.098
Why do you think that is?
Do you know?

43:56.334 --> 43:59.002
'Cause...
even though they were grown up,

43:59.070 --> 44:01.270
I think he wanted to have
another Christmas with them.

44:06.845 --> 44:08.645
[clears throat]

44:10.649 --> 44:11.781
Okay, I think...

44:11.816 --> 44:14.183
one very last piece.

44:14.252 --> 44:15.585
We've got to get
in there.

44:24.829 --> 44:26.929
[Willa]: I've just been
so focused on Scout

44:26.965 --> 44:28.398
these last few years,

44:28.433 --> 44:30.767
I barely even remember
what it's like

44:30.802 --> 44:32.635
to have a conversation
with a man,

44:32.671 --> 44:34.437
let alone date one.

44:34.472 --> 44:35.672
Then it's time.

44:37.442 --> 44:40.009
Why are we even talking
about this?

44:40.078 --> 44:41.744
Nothing's happened.

44:41.780 --> 44:43.646
Except you're
thinking about it.

44:46.251 --> 44:48.751
I had a patient who gave me
an extraordinary gift.

44:48.787 --> 44:51.788
He challenged me
to live the life I dream of.

44:52.824 --> 44:53.824
So?

44:53.858 --> 44:55.124
The problem is,

44:55.160 --> 44:57.593
I don't remember
what my dreams are,

44:57.629 --> 45:02.632
and I don't want
to just get by...

45:02.667 --> 45:04.500
but what do you do

45:04.536 --> 45:06.436
when you've been given
a second chance at life,

45:06.471 --> 45:08.337
and you don't know
what to do with it?

45:08.373 --> 45:12.308
Well, what if you just took
one step,

45:12.343 --> 45:13.376
and then another,

45:13.445 --> 45:15.445
and then another?

45:15.480 --> 45:18.314
All you have to do
is ask yourself,

45:18.349 --> 45:20.183
What's step one?

45:25.090 --> 45:27.156
Okay.

45:27.192 --> 45:29.492
[Finn]:
"Scout..."

45:29.527 --> 45:30.660
[Scout]:
Scout Loves Skating!

45:30.695 --> 45:33.196
Scout Loves
Skating!

45:33.264 --> 45:36.632
Okay, the "Scout Loves"
series, we'll call it.

45:36.668 --> 45:39.302
You are my new
copywriter.

45:39.337 --> 45:40.937
Done!

45:40.972 --> 45:42.538
Maybe I could
put these together,

45:42.607 --> 45:43.539
like a present

45:43.608 --> 45:44.841
for my mom.

45:44.876 --> 45:47.810
Your drawings and my captions.

45:47.846 --> 45:50.179
I could also write
a story around them.

45:50.215 --> 45:52.014
Hm.

45:52.050 --> 45:54.383
Or...
we don't have to.

45:54.452 --> 45:55.518
I could do something else.

45:55.553 --> 45:56.686
No, no...

45:56.721 --> 45:58.721
I'm sure she
would love it,

45:58.790 --> 46:00.623
and maybe someday,

46:00.658 --> 46:02.658
you'll even write
your own book.

46:02.694 --> 46:04.227
Me?
Write a book?

46:04.295 --> 46:05.828
Why not? You've
read so many.

46:05.864 --> 46:07.630
I bet you'd make
a great writer.

46:07.665 --> 46:09.425
Is that what you want
to be when you grow up?

46:12.771 --> 46:15.037
I.. I didn't... um...

46:17.108 --> 46:19.375
I was really sick
the last two years.

46:19.444 --> 46:20.444
They thought I might die.

46:22.947 --> 46:24.213
S...

46:24.282 --> 46:25.381
Scout, is...

46:25.450 --> 46:26.849
So everyone
stopped asking

46:26.885 --> 46:29.986
what I wanted to be
when I grew up.

46:30.021 --> 46:33.122
I had this operation
on my heart last May.

46:33.158 --> 46:34.690
It was
a new kind of operation

46:34.726 --> 46:35.858
that they didn't
have before,

46:35.894 --> 46:38.561
so I was real lucky.

46:41.232 --> 46:42.665
Yeah, that's, um...

46:44.869 --> 46:46.636
Wow, I had...

46:47.972 --> 46:48.972
That's amazing.

46:50.708 --> 46:53.209
My mom says
we both got a second chance,

46:53.244 --> 46:54.577
so...

46:54.646 --> 46:55.686
maybe I could be a writer.

46:57.549 --> 46:58.648
[phone vibrates]

46:58.683 --> 47:00.149
All right, one sec.

47:00.185 --> 47:01.117
Maybe that's your...

47:01.152 --> 47:02.118
Yep.

47:02.153 --> 47:03.352
What is it?

47:03.388 --> 47:05.188
Oh, your mom says

47:05.223 --> 47:08.891
that she and Sage
are making a lot of cookies.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.226
Really? Let's go!

47:10.295 --> 47:12.295
Let's go! I agree.

47:13.998 --> 47:14.998
You know,

47:15.033 --> 47:17.133
we have a lot in common.

47:17.168 --> 47:20.136
We both like skating
and <i> Everyday Sam</i>,

47:20.171 --> 47:22.638
and our fathers weren't here
for Christmas.

47:36.821 --> 47:37.787
Thanks, Finn!

47:37.822 --> 47:39.088
Yeah.

47:49.033 --> 47:50.766
Cookies!

47:50.802 --> 47:53.002
Just in time!
Want to help decorate?

47:54.172 --> 47:55.671
Here, let me get
these off.

48:00.411 --> 48:01.143
Welcome back!

48:01.179 --> 48:02.945
Hey.

48:02.981 --> 48:04.180
Um...

48:04.249 --> 48:05.609
Willa, can I talk to you
for a sec?

48:06.784 --> 48:08.184
Of course.

48:08.253 --> 48:09.852
Be right back.

48:11.489 --> 48:12.521
Let's decorate!

48:14.926 --> 48:16.792
Hey.

48:16.828 --> 48:18.194
Is everything okay?

48:18.263 --> 48:19.406
Scout wasn't a
problem, was he?

48:19.430 --> 48:22.031
No, no, no.
He's amazing.

48:22.100 --> 48:24.634
He's, uh...
he's an incredible kid.

48:24.669 --> 48:26.969
Thanks.

48:27.005 --> 48:28.704
So is there
anything wrong?

48:30.775 --> 48:31.874
He almost died?

48:33.611 --> 48:35.611
What did he tell you?

48:35.647 --> 48:37.947
He told me
he had a heart operation,

48:37.982 --> 48:40.149
and that for two years...

48:40.184 --> 48:42.952
For two years,

48:42.987 --> 48:44.627
we weren't sure
he was going to make it...

48:46.991 --> 48:49.325
but now,
he's just a regular kid.

48:51.162 --> 48:52.028
That's
what you've been dealing with

48:52.096 --> 48:53.930
for the last
two years.

48:53.965 --> 48:55.531
Mm-hm.

48:55.600 --> 48:57.667
And his dad...?

48:57.702 --> 48:59.802
Well, he doesn't
really pitch in,

48:59.837 --> 49:03.005
so as the medical
bills mounted,

49:03.041 --> 49:07.009
Scout and I have had
to live week-to-week.

49:07.045 --> 49:09.345
And so this holiday is...

49:09.380 --> 49:12.014
This holiday...

49:12.050 --> 49:13.716
this is a dream,

49:13.785 --> 49:15.151
given what we've been through.

49:15.186 --> 49:17.486
And your...

49:17.522 --> 49:19.989
Mr. Conrad...

49:20.024 --> 49:21.024
he knew that.

49:22.827 --> 49:24.026
And it's more than that.

49:25.663 --> 49:27.863
He left us enough money

49:27.899 --> 49:31.033
to pay
all of Scout's medical bills...

49:31.069 --> 49:32.702
a hundred thousand dollars.

49:35.540 --> 49:37.139
For the operation.

49:37.175 --> 49:41.444
And I don't know
how I can ever repay that,

49:41.479 --> 49:44.480
except to make sure
that Scout has the best life

49:44.515 --> 49:46.349
he possibly can,

49:46.384 --> 49:47.616
and to take this chance

49:47.652 --> 49:50.653
to find
what I'm meant to be doing too.

49:50.688 --> 49:52.054
That's, uh...

49:54.959 --> 49:56.892
That's an incredible gift.

49:56.961 --> 49:59.829
I just wish
I could tell his children

49:59.864 --> 50:01.731
what he's done...

50:01.799 --> 50:04.300
you know, how much he changed
at the end of his life.

50:04.335 --> 50:07.670
When he was younger,
he worked hard,

50:07.705 --> 50:09.683
but he felt he was a constant
source of disappointment

50:09.707 --> 50:11.140
to his family

50:11.175 --> 50:12.675
and, for some reason,

50:12.710 --> 50:15.177
thought they would be better off
without him,

50:15.213 --> 50:16.545
that if he left,

50:16.581 --> 50:19.015
his wife could find
someone else to love her

50:19.050 --> 50:20.416
and raise his kids

50:20.485 --> 50:22.318
the way he thought
they deserved.

50:23.855 --> 50:25.021
But then, in the end, he...?

50:25.056 --> 50:26.589
Well, at the end of his life,

50:26.657 --> 50:28.369
he felt it was the biggest
mistake he'd ever made,

50:28.393 --> 50:31.761
but it was too late
to change it.

50:31.829 --> 50:32.995
Leaving his children

50:33.031 --> 50:35.364
was the biggest regret
of his life.

50:42.407 --> 50:45.408
Mr. Conrad...

50:46.577 --> 50:48.244
his family...

50:50.748 --> 50:54.683
they are so lucky
that you were there for him.

50:54.719 --> 50:57.853
Anybody would be lucky
to have you in their life,

50:57.889 --> 50:58.889
and it's no wonder.

51:00.858 --> 51:02.391
It's no wonder
he wanted you to thrive,

51:02.427 --> 51:04.060
to have a second chance.

51:04.095 --> 51:05.428
Willa...

51:09.333 --> 51:10.866
I need to tell you something,

51:10.902 --> 51:14.370
and I should have told you
when we first met.

51:16.441 --> 51:19.875
[Mable]: What is happening
in my house?

51:21.345 --> 51:22.411
What is happening?

51:22.447 --> 51:23.412
Can... Maybe we should...

51:23.448 --> 51:24.448
Okay.

51:24.515 --> 51:26.015
Yeah, okay...

51:27.418 --> 51:29.151
Okay.

51:29.187 --> 51:30.152
I know this
looks bad.

51:30.188 --> 51:32.755
You're cooking
in my kitchen?

51:32.824 --> 51:34.323
Sage, you're
my own niece!

51:34.358 --> 51:35.658
How could you?

51:35.693 --> 51:37.660
Oh, to heck
with all that, Mable.

51:39.197 --> 51:40.574
Did you have an accident?
Did you hurt your foot?

51:40.598 --> 51:42.164
Yes.

51:42.200 --> 51:43.960
Right, so can you do
all of this by yourself?

51:44.902 --> 51:46.602
No.

51:46.671 --> 51:48.649
[Ken]: Then either
you have to let people help you,

51:48.673 --> 51:49.683
or nothing's
going to get done.

51:49.707 --> 51:51.040
Your choice.

51:53.044 --> 51:54.844
Are you really that stubborn

51:54.879 --> 51:56.223
that you'd rather not have
a full Christmas around here?

51:56.247 --> 51:57.247
Yes.

51:59.684 --> 52:00.964
[Ken]:
These people care for you.

52:02.053 --> 52:04.887
If you're incapable
of seeing that, I...

52:04.922 --> 52:06.455
I'm sorry.

52:11.863 --> 52:13.129
Excuse me.

52:18.369 --> 52:20.202
Wait.

52:20.238 --> 52:22.104
I'm going for a drive.

52:22.173 --> 52:23.706
Oh, you're angry.

52:23.741 --> 52:25.841
No, I'm not.

52:25.877 --> 52:27.176
I just don't understand
people

52:27.211 --> 52:29.345
who can't see
what's right in front of them.

52:40.124 --> 52:42.525
[sighs]

52:42.560 --> 52:46.295
So I was being a tyrant...

52:46.364 --> 52:48.130
and I'm sorry.

52:48.199 --> 52:49.398
It's just this place

52:49.433 --> 52:50.399
should be so much
Christmas-ier by now,

52:50.434 --> 52:51.867
and I just didn't know

52:51.903 --> 52:54.436
how to accomplish that
on my own, so...

52:54.472 --> 52:56.972
if you amazing people
would like to help me with that,

52:57.041 --> 53:00.276
I would welcome that.

53:01.646 --> 53:03.279
What can we do?

53:03.314 --> 53:06.615
Oh, thank you.

something.

54:22.727 --> 54:24.059
[Willa]: You did?

54:26.631 --> 54:28.497
Oh, my goodness!
What is this?

54:28.566 --> 54:30.132
Early Christmas
present.

54:31.802 --> 54:32.968
[laughs]

54:34.238 --> 54:35.304
You remembered!

54:35.339 --> 54:37.806
Oh, it's incredible!

54:37.842 --> 54:39.275
Thank you.

54:39.310 --> 54:41.143
Aw...

54:41.178 --> 54:42.911
Thank you.

54:42.947 --> 54:45.180
Look at what you did.

54:45.249 --> 54:46.915
No,
this is what we did,

54:46.951 --> 54:49.118
and hats off to your aunt
for letting us.

54:49.153 --> 54:50.486
Hats off to you.

54:50.521 --> 54:52.354
She's been different
since you came,

54:52.423 --> 54:55.758
and someone else
has changed too.

54:56.994 --> 54:58.314
[Sage]: He's wonderful
with Scout.

55:00.998 --> 55:02.498
You two seem pretty cozy.

55:02.566 --> 55:04.433
You still thinking
about all that?

55:06.070 --> 55:07.236
My head knows
it's crazy,

55:07.271 --> 55:10.739
but I'm trying to do
what I promised.

55:10.775 --> 55:12.941
You know,
follow my heart,

55:12.977 --> 55:14.910
embrace my life,

55:14.945 --> 55:16.312
take a chance.

55:16.347 --> 55:18.180
There you go.

55:19.917 --> 55:21.417
I went a little crazy

55:21.452 --> 55:23.752
and bought all sorts of treats
for all of you.

55:23.788 --> 55:25.354
[they laugh]

55:29.694 --> 55:31.660
Oh!

55:31.696 --> 55:34.330
Just look at that.

55:34.365 --> 55:36.832
Now it looks
like Christmas.

55:41.105 --> 55:42.705
Thank you.

55:47.311 --> 55:48.477
[Molly]:
<i>So the $100,000</i>

55:48.512 --> 55:49.211
<i>was to pay
for medical bills?</i>

55:49.280 --> 55:50.813
<i>Seriously?</i>

55:50.848 --> 55:52.581
She's a health care aide
with a kid

55:52.616 --> 55:54.561
and a mountain of bills,
just struggling to get by.

55:54.585 --> 55:55.784
<i>Dad gave her a way out.</i>

55:55.820 --> 55:56.952
Or she's lying to you.

55:56.987 --> 55:58.821
It was the son
that told me.

55:58.856 --> 56:00.189
Wait, sorry.

56:00.257 --> 56:02.424
So now you're bonding
with her son?

56:02.460 --> 56:04.960
Mol, just listen...

56:04.995 --> 56:07.796
<i>Look, I don't know
what's going on there,</i>

56:07.832 --> 56:09.009
but it sounds to me
like she's got you turned around

56:09.033 --> 56:10.199
like she did Dad.

56:10.267 --> 56:12.835
It's not what you think.

56:12.870 --> 56:14.169
Dad opened up to her.

56:14.205 --> 56:15.838
<i>He told her</i>

56:15.873 --> 56:17.517
<i>that he regretted so much
what he'd done to us,</i>

56:17.541 --> 56:19.708
and in his own mind,

56:19.777 --> 56:21.710
he thought at the time
that he was helping Mom

56:21.779 --> 56:23.779
so she could get married

56:23.814 --> 56:25.314
<i>so that</i>

56:25.349 --> 56:26.526
<i>there would be someone there
for her, for us.</i>

56:26.550 --> 56:29.551
Or she's on to you,

56:29.620 --> 56:30.864
and she knows exactly
what to say

56:30.888 --> 56:31.888
to push your buttons.

56:33.624 --> 56:34.990
She's not like that,
all right?

56:35.025 --> 56:37.526
And this was never
about the money,

56:37.561 --> 56:40.329
money which we don't need,
by the way.

56:42.133 --> 56:44.767
Now, it's time
to let all of this go.

56:48.172 --> 56:50.706
I'm not showing her
the injunction.

56:50.775 --> 56:52.808
I'm not going to pursue it,
and neither should you.

56:52.843 --> 56:55.010
<i>So, what, that's it?</i>

56:55.045 --> 56:56.456
You just come back to Seattle
for Christmas

56:56.480 --> 56:57.480
and forget about it?

56:59.784 --> 57:01.350
I'm going to stay here
for Christmas.

57:01.385 --> 57:02.885
I'll see you at New Year's
in Seattle.

57:02.953 --> 57:03.953
We'll, uh...

57:03.988 --> 57:06.021
raise a glass for Dad

57:06.056 --> 57:09.992
and think of the good times
we did have with him.

57:10.027 --> 57:11.293
All right?

57:11.328 --> 57:13.395
You have a good Christmas.

57:13.464 --> 57:14.496
<i>I'll call you.</i>

57:14.532 --> 57:15.532
Finn, you...

57:28.913 --> 57:30.879
Okay, you can stop.

57:30.915 --> 57:32.047
You've done enough.

57:32.082 --> 57:33.849
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve.

57:33.884 --> 57:35.284
I want it all to be perfect
for you.

57:36.587 --> 57:39.555
You know, you act
like you like doing this.

57:39.623 --> 57:41.223
I do.
Is that completely crazy?

57:41.292 --> 57:42.858
Yes.

57:42.893 --> 57:43.893
[laughs]

57:43.961 --> 57:44.961
Now...

57:44.995 --> 57:46.361
come on.

57:46.397 --> 57:47.496
Come have some of this.

57:48.566 --> 57:50.466
No, I really shouldn't.

57:50.501 --> 57:52.568
Three different kinds
of chocolate.

57:52.636 --> 57:54.303
Okay, if you insist.

57:59.577 --> 58:01.076
Oh, Willa!

58:01.145 --> 58:02.010
It's a sickness.
I know.

58:02.046 --> 58:03.679
Yeah.

58:05.483 --> 58:06.682
Thank you.

58:08.185 --> 58:09.985
I don't know
how you do this.

58:10.020 --> 58:11.753
Oh, it's just
an old family recipe.

58:11.822 --> 58:14.189
I mean running this place
single-handedly,

58:14.225 --> 58:16.158
even before
you broke your ankle.

58:16.193 --> 58:18.393
How do you do it alone?

58:18.429 --> 58:19.361
Can I tell you a secret?

58:19.396 --> 58:21.196
Mm-hm.

58:21.232 --> 58:24.099
I didn't break my ankle
horseback riding.

58:24.168 --> 58:25.501
No?

58:25.536 --> 58:27.870
That's just
what I've been saying.

58:27.905 --> 58:29.271
Mm.

58:29.340 --> 58:30.383
I did it
walking down the stairs,

58:30.407 --> 58:31.840
holding laundry,

58:31.876 --> 58:35.878
while on the phone
with a prospective guest.

58:35.913 --> 58:37.179
So you know it's too much.

58:37.214 --> 58:39.548
Yeah.

58:39.583 --> 58:41.850
I just didn't know
what to do about it, or...

58:41.886 --> 58:43.752
how to ask for help.

58:45.890 --> 58:47.322
Ken was right.

58:49.493 --> 58:51.493
Okay, can I be
completely inappropriate?

58:51.529 --> 58:52.594
Mm-hm.

58:52.663 --> 58:53.595
Ken likes you.

58:53.664 --> 58:55.564
Oh, I know.

58:55.599 --> 58:56.676
I've known since high school.

58:56.700 --> 58:59.001
Well, do you like him back?

58:59.036 --> 59:01.236
I do.

59:01.272 --> 59:02.272
Then what's the problem?

59:02.339 --> 59:04.673
What if he uproots
his life,

59:04.708 --> 59:06.542
and then
it doesn't work out?

59:06.577 --> 59:08.210
No.

59:08.245 --> 59:09.923
I'd rather just bury myself
in so much work

59:09.947 --> 59:12.948
that I couldn't possibly
be open to a relationship,

59:13.017 --> 59:14.683
and that way,
it won't happen,

59:14.718 --> 59:16.919
and no one gets hurt.

59:18.522 --> 59:22.858
Or bury yourself
in caring for your child.

59:24.695 --> 59:26.361
Scout's been very sick
the last two years.

59:26.397 --> 59:28.330
He's better now,

59:28.365 --> 59:31.433
but I think I've
used it as an excuse...

59:31.502 --> 59:33.268
To not join the world.

59:33.337 --> 59:34.269
And the truth is,

59:34.338 --> 59:35.771
I'm starting to feel

59:35.839 --> 59:38.707
that there is a bigger picture
for me,

how to get at it.

what you've done around here.

It's who you are.

59:55.559 --> 59:58.894
You...
you're a caretaker.

Okay.

Let me talk to you
for a minute.

What do you think

01:00:28.425 --> 01:00:32.361
if maybe I didn't look
for another health-care job?

01:00:32.396 --> 01:00:34.062
What kind of job
would you get?

about the book reading
on Christmas Eve?

Well, it looks like

01:01:05.729 --> 01:01:07.229

to put all these drawings

to be our rink.

who stole from our father.

01:04:41.411 --> 01:04:42.510
She didn't steal
from us,

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:43.778

just in the nick of time,

Would you stop?
What are you going to do?

01:04:53.457 --> 01:04:55.490
I'm going to do what
you couldn't do...

01:04:55.525 --> 01:04:56.825
confront her.

01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:58.226
Okay, please...

01:04:58.295 --> 01:04:59.895
Just... stop.
Listen.

01:05:02.733 --> 01:05:03.665
I have feelings for this person.

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.200
No, okay?
I know,

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:06.902
but please, really...

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:08.003
I think...

01:05:08.038 --> 01:05:10.238
that I could...

01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:12.874
Okay, what if you're wrong, huh?

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:15.844
Well, then, why don't we
just tell her the truth,

01:05:15.879 --> 01:05:17.178
and see what she says?

01:05:17.214 --> 01:05:18.346
What, that I came here

01:05:18.382 --> 01:05:19.314
to find out
if she stole from us?

01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:21.716
That I've been lying
to her?

01:05:21.752 --> 01:05:24.252
She trusts me now.

01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:25.687
She's opened up to me.
I've...

01:05:27.524 --> 01:05:28.657
I've opened up to her,
and...

01:05:30.861 --> 01:05:32.994
Except for the fact, Finn,

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:34.896
that you've been lying
about who you are

01:05:34.932 --> 01:05:36.331
this whole time.

01:05:37.734 --> 01:05:39.234
Look...

01:05:39.303 --> 01:05:41.169
we have a week,

01:05:41.204 --> 01:05:44.506
and then we will never be able
to contest this again.

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:47.008
If you let this go,
you will regret it.

01:05:51.915 --> 01:05:52.915
Okay, fine,

01:05:52.983 --> 01:05:55.150
but just let me do it

01:05:55.185 --> 01:05:57.652
in my own way, on my own time,
all right?

01:05:57.688 --> 01:05:59.654
And then
we will both get our answers.

01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:02.824
What are we buying?

01:06:02.859 --> 01:06:04.759
Well, we made
so many new friends this week,

01:06:04.828 --> 01:06:06.728
I didn't even think
to pack gifts,

01:06:06.763 --> 01:06:11.900
so something for Mable and Sage
and Savannah and Finn.

01:06:11.935 --> 01:06:13.668
And Ken.

01:06:13.704 --> 01:06:16.204
What? We're going to get
something for Santa?

01:06:16.239 --> 01:06:18.006
I bet no one else
thinks of that.

01:06:18.041 --> 01:06:19.507
I think you're right.

01:06:19.543 --> 01:06:20.720
So, which one
should we work on first?

01:06:20.744 --> 01:06:22.243
Finn's!

01:06:22.279 --> 01:06:24.179
Okay, then let's do Mable's.

01:06:24.214 --> 01:06:25.780
And then Ken's
and Sage's.

01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:27.382
Hey there!

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:29.584
I didn't, uh,
see you back at Bramble House.

01:06:29.619 --> 01:06:30.819
Well, I figured

01:06:30.854 --> 01:06:32.220
you would be busy
with your sister.

01:06:32.255 --> 01:06:34.990
Oh. Yeah, she's just resting
back in her room.

01:06:35.025 --> 01:06:35.890
I thought
you were going to Seattle

01:06:35.926 --> 01:06:37.525
to see her for Christmas.

01:06:37.561 --> 01:06:39.094
Well, I was,

01:06:39.162 --> 01:06:42.230
and there's just
a little change in plans.

01:06:42.265 --> 01:06:44.399
Because you wanted
to stay here with us longer?

01:06:44.434 --> 01:06:46.167
[Willa laughs]

01:06:46.203 --> 01:06:47.569
Um...

01:06:47.604 --> 01:06:49.537
There's a display
I wanted to go look at

01:06:49.573 --> 01:06:50.372
in the store.

01:06:50.407 --> 01:06:51.539
Can I see it?

01:06:51.575 --> 01:06:52.540
[Willa]:
Uh, sure.

01:06:52.576 --> 01:06:54.042
Okay.

01:06:55.445 --> 01:06:57.512
[Willa]:
Hey, is everything okay?

01:06:57.547 --> 01:06:59.914
[Finn]: Oh, yeah.
I just, um...

01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:03.585
I just have really enjoyed
our time together, Willa...

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.920
Yeah, me...
me too.

01:07:05.956 --> 01:07:07.689
And I don't want it to end...

01:07:07.724 --> 01:07:09.391
I mean,

01:07:09.426 --> 01:07:10.859
if you felt the same way too.

01:07:10.894 --> 01:07:11.793
I... I do.

01:07:11.862 --> 01:07:13.728
I...

01:07:13.764 --> 01:07:16.464
And I don't really know
what that would look like,

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:18.767
or how that would work...

01:07:18.802 --> 01:07:19.868
But you would want to,

01:07:19.903 --> 01:07:21.703
if we could?

01:07:21.738 --> 01:07:23.338

uh...

in the library?

01:07:29.079 --> 01:07:30.111
Sure.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

Oh, all right.
I won't ask any questions.

Yep. Move along.

01:07:49.466 --> 01:07:50.965
Come in.

01:07:54.471 --> 01:07:55.537

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:37.245

I will.

01:08:50.827 --> 01:08:52.260
[Ken, as Santa]:
Did you know

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:54.429
that this book,
<i>The Night Before Christmas,</i>

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:56.764
was a gift
from the writer to his daughter?

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.334
After we read the poem,
we'll celebrate the holiday

01:08:59.402 --> 01:09:01.970
with homemade Christmas cookies!

01:09:02.005 --> 01:09:03.071
[children cheer]

01:09:05.108 --> 01:09:08.176
And there's one more
extra-special treat.

01:09:08.245 --> 01:09:09.978
We have
with us tonight

01:09:10.046 --> 01:09:12.981
the illustrator
from the <i> Everyday Sam</i> books,

01:09:13.049 --> 01:09:15.917
Mr. Finn Knightly!

01:09:15.952 --> 01:09:17.618
Hey, guys.

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:19.821
Shall we get started?

01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:21.823
'Twas the night
before Christmas,

01:09:21.892 --> 01:09:23.658
when all through the house,

01:09:23.727 --> 01:09:26.728
not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse...

01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:30.910
[Finn]: So I think
what Everyday Sam shows us

01:09:30.934 --> 01:09:36.337
is that any kid can be a hero
in their own life,

01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:37.505
and right here in Bramble,

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:41.109
I, um...
I met a hero of my own,

01:09:41.144 --> 01:09:43.077
and his name
is Scout Fairchild.

01:09:43.113 --> 01:09:45.145
Scout, can you
stand up, please?

01:09:48.285 --> 01:09:50.919
Come on up,
come on up.

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:52.987
Scout here
has a very special gift

01:09:53.023 --> 01:09:55.290
that he would like
to share with us tonight,

01:09:55.325 --> 01:09:56.925
and...

01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:01.696
it is his
very first book.

01:10:01.765 --> 01:10:03.665
I had a great time in Bramble
this week

01:10:03.733 --> 01:10:05.567
because my mom
brought me here,

01:10:05.602 --> 01:10:07.335
so Merry Christmas, Mom.

01:10:07.404 --> 01:10:10.004
You're the best.

01:10:10.073 --> 01:10:11.339

01:10:13.343 --> 01:10:15.243
What is this?

01:10:34.431 --> 01:10:36.331
Best Christmas ever.

01:10:40.303 --> 01:10:42.604
Thank you.

01:10:47.210 --> 01:10:48.210
Um...

01:10:51.114 --> 01:10:52.647
[Ken, as Santa]:
Here you go.

01:10:52.682 --> 01:10:53.922
[Mable]: Don't
forget your milk.

01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:56.150
There you go,
sweetheart.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:59.020
There you are.

01:11:00.023 --> 01:11:01.522
We make a good team.

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:02.991
We do.

01:11:05.295 --> 01:11:08.763
Maybe I could, uh,
help you clean up.

01:11:08.798 --> 01:11:11.332
Maybe I'd be okay
with that.

01:11:12.369 --> 01:11:13.935
Really?

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:16.871
Maybe I should have said that
a long time ago.

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:19.941
Well, better late than never.

01:11:19.976 --> 01:11:21.976
[Scout]: And afterwards,

01:11:22.012 --> 01:11:24.679
all these kids came up to me
to see Finn's drawings.

01:11:24.714 --> 01:11:25.714
Can you believe it?

01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:27.048
I saw that!

01:11:27.117 --> 01:11:28.950
It was an
incredible gift,

01:11:28.985 --> 01:11:31.119
and now it is time
to go straight to bed.

01:11:31.154 --> 01:11:32.387
It's Christmas Eve.

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:34.055
Can I open one present?

01:11:34.124 --> 01:11:35.957
No, because you
had a big night,

01:11:35.992 --> 01:11:37.392
and because Santa
still has to come.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.393

01:11:50.173 --> 01:11:51.939
We didn't get
to officially meet earlier,

01:11:51.975 --> 01:11:53.753
and your brother has been
so kind to me and my son.

01:11:53.777 --> 01:11:55.443
I'm Willa Fairchild.

01:11:55.478 --> 01:11:56.611
I know who you are.

01:11:56.646 --> 01:12:00.648
My full name
is Molly Conrad,

01:12:00.684 --> 01:12:06.487
and Finn's full name
is Gregory Finnegan Conrad, Jr.

01:12:06.523 --> 01:12:08.389
Knightly's just
his professional name.

01:12:09.826 --> 01:12:11.559
We're both
Greg Conrad's children.

01:12:18.134 --> 01:12:19.567
So you're Molly,

01:12:19.602 --> 01:12:21.002
and Finn is Greg Jr.?

01:12:22.339 --> 01:12:23.339
Well...

01:12:23.406 --> 01:12:25.640
why wouldn't
he tell me that?

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:27.053
Because he wanted
to find out the truth

01:12:27.077 --> 01:12:28.357
about what you did
to our father.

01:12:28.411 --> 01:12:30.611
What I did to him?

01:12:30.647 --> 01:12:31.746
Conning him...

01:12:31.781 --> 01:12:33.748
into leaving you $100,000.

01:12:33.783 --> 01:12:36.584

01:12:36.619 --> 01:12:39.020
Wha...

01:12:39.089 --> 01:12:40.655
Finn thinks I conned him?

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:42.490
He had a lawyer
draw up an injunction

01:12:42.559 --> 01:12:44.092
to file against you.

01:12:46.296 --> 01:12:47.296
No...

01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:48.930
Finn wouldn't...

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:49.965
[Finn]:
Molly, stop!

01:12:51.935 --> 01:12:53.434
Willa...

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:54.470
Did you do this?

01:12:54.504 --> 01:12:55.670
No, Molly...

01:12:55.739 --> 01:12:57.605
You thought
I stole from you

01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.006
so you came here to...

01:12:59.075 --> 01:13:00.575
to... to what?

01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:01.576
To get close to me,
and then...

01:13:01.611 --> 01:13:02.577
No.

01:13:02.612 --> 01:13:04.112
I told Molly

01:13:04.147 --> 01:13:06.147
that you didn't do
anything wrong.

01:13:06.182 --> 01:13:06.981
I understand that now.

01:13:07.016 --> 01:13:08.316
"Now?"

01:13:09.419 --> 01:13:10.852
So it's true.

01:13:12.989 --> 01:13:14.989
You came here to expose me
as a...

01:13:15.024 --> 01:13:16.290
as a fraud, as a fake?

01:13:16.326 --> 01:13:17.458
No.

01:13:19.329 --> 01:13:21.162
Okay, it started like that,
but after...

01:13:21.197 --> 01:13:22.296
It "started" like that?

01:13:28.004 --> 01:13:29.637

to a nine-year-old?

01:13:29.672 --> 01:13:30.972
Of course not.

01:13:31.007 --> 01:13:32.173
Look, let me explain.

01:13:32.208 --> 01:13:33.775
You know what?

01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:37.745
I am sorry
to disappoint you both,

01:13:37.781 --> 01:13:40.148
but I'm not interested
in your money.

01:13:40.183 --> 01:13:41.649

after he left your mother

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:57.832
he did because he loved you,

a mistake,

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:00.768

01:16:42.365 --> 01:16:44.332
being a kid at Christmas.

01:16:44.367 --> 01:16:46.233
Is that why you came here?

01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:47.501
I came...

01:16:47.537 --> 01:16:51.372
I think Finn and I came
because...

01:16:54.077 --> 01:16:55.242
I'm sorry.

01:16:55.278 --> 01:16:56.577
Can I borrow this,
please?

01:16:56.613 --> 01:16:57.613
Yes.

01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.847
Thank you.

01:16:59.882 --> 01:17:02.550
Is there anything else
I can do?

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:06.387
I need to find Willa.

01:17:06.422 --> 01:17:07.755
[knocking on door]

01:17:08.725 --> 01:17:10.057
Yeah.

01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:15.708
[Finn]:
I can't believe that's Dad.

01:17:15.732 --> 01:17:16.564
He looks so happy.

01:17:16.599 --> 01:17:17.898
[Molly]: Yeah.

01:17:17.934 --> 01:17:20.267
That's why he wanted
Willa to come here.

01:17:20.336 --> 01:17:22.269
He wanted to give
her and her son

01:17:22.338 --> 01:17:24.538
a Christmas memory
like he had.

01:17:27.543 --> 01:17:29.210
And that's why he saved
those ornaments,

01:17:29.245 --> 01:17:32.213
'cause that was his last
Christmas with us too.

01:17:34.283 --> 01:17:35.583
I was just so mad

01:17:35.618 --> 01:17:37.284
at everything
I thought I had lost,

01:17:37.353 --> 01:17:39.620
but Willa and Scout,
they...

01:17:42.125 --> 01:17:43.591
they brought Dad
back to me.

01:17:43.626 --> 01:17:45.893
After you left,
I just...

01:17:45.928 --> 01:17:48.863
I got so angry...

01:17:48.898 --> 01:17:50.031
but it is not
their fault.

01:17:50.066 --> 01:17:51.699
No, it's no one's fault.

01:17:54.303 --> 01:17:57.304
Finn, Willa and Scout
left for the airport.

01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:00.775
[Scout]:
I don't understand.

01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:03.444
Why did we have to leave?

01:18:03.479 --> 01:18:04.912
I told you already, Scout.

01:18:04.947 --> 01:18:06.747
It just...

01:18:06.783 --> 01:18:09.216
it didn't work out
at Bramble House.

01:18:09.252 --> 01:18:10.484
But it's Christmas!

01:18:10.553 --> 01:18:13.220
We didn't even get
to say goodbye.

01:18:13.256 --> 01:18:15.122
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm really sorry.

01:18:18.461 --> 01:18:20.561
Mom, please stop!

01:18:20.596 --> 01:18:22.563
I want to see the tree
one last time.

01:18:22.598 --> 01:18:23.598
[sighs]

01:18:25.168 --> 01:18:26.667
Okay.

01:18:26.736 --> 01:18:28.636
Just for
a few minutes.

01:18:34.077 --> 01:18:36.310
[Molly]:
So, what's your plan?

01:18:36.345 --> 01:18:38.065
I'm going to stop her plane.
That's my plan.

01:18:39.782 --> 01:18:40.848
Wait, wait!
Hold on!

01:18:40.917 --> 01:18:41.816
Pull over!
Pull over, please!

01:18:41.851 --> 01:18:43.684
Just stop.
Just stop!

01:18:43.753 --> 01:18:45.419
[Finn]:
That's them by the tree!

01:18:47.523 --> 01:18:49.323
[Willa]: We'll always
have beautiful memories

01:18:49.358 --> 01:18:51.459
of this place,

01:18:51.494 --> 01:18:54.161
and that's
what Mr. Conrad wanted for us.

01:18:55.932 --> 01:18:57.231
[Finn]: Hey!

01:18:58.234 --> 01:19:00.067
Mom! Finn!

01:19:02.505 --> 01:19:04.105
Please just hear me out.

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:05.140
Finn...

01:19:05.174 --> 01:19:06.140
I'm begging you.

01:19:06.175 --> 01:19:08.275
I...

01:19:09.479 --> 01:19:11.946
Look, Willa, I made
a terrible mistake,

01:19:11.981 --> 01:19:13.514
so please,

01:19:13.583 --> 01:19:15.816
don't blame him
for what I did.

01:19:15.852 --> 01:19:17.752
Will you
hear him out?

01:19:22.024 --> 01:19:23.758
Hi! My name's Molly.

01:19:23.793 --> 01:19:25.826
I'm Finn's
older sister.

01:19:25.862 --> 01:19:26.761
Would you show me
the Christmas tree?

01:19:26.796 --> 01:19:27.661
Mm-hm.

01:19:27.697 --> 01:19:29.630
Yeah.

01:19:29.665 --> 01:19:30.965
Go ahead.

01:19:36.973 --> 01:19:39.306
I did everything wrong.

01:19:39.342 --> 01:19:40.641
Uh...

01:19:40.676 --> 01:19:41.916
I should have
told you the truth

01:19:41.944 --> 01:19:42.944
from the beginning,

01:19:42.979 --> 01:19:44.678
but you have to believe me.

01:19:44.714 --> 01:19:46.658
The only lie I really told you
was why I came to Bramble.

01:19:46.682 --> 01:19:48.949
Everything else, this...

01:19:48.985 --> 01:19:50.351
was real.

01:19:51.654 --> 01:19:52.753
I trusted you.

01:19:52.789 --> 01:19:53.921
I know.

01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:56.791
I hadn't done that
with anyone.

01:19:56.826 --> 01:20:00.127
I was just so blinded
by what had happened,

01:20:00.163 --> 01:20:01.273
and I couldn't see through it,

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:04.365
but you opened my eyes, and...

01:20:04.433 --> 01:20:07.768
if nothing comes from this,

01:20:07.804 --> 01:20:09.670
I will always be grateful to you
for that.

01:20:09.705 --> 01:20:11.605
Hey...

01:20:11.641 --> 01:20:13.040
but Willa...

01:20:14.644 --> 01:20:16.811
Let me make it up to you, hmm?

01:20:16.846 --> 01:20:18.524
Let me make this
the best Christmas for you ever,

01:20:18.548 --> 01:20:21.182
for you
and Scout...

01:20:21.217 --> 01:20:23.551
and the best
New Year's,

01:20:23.619 --> 01:20:27.688
and the best...
Valentine's Day,

01:20:27.723 --> 01:20:28.956
and the best Arbor Day...

01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:30.324
uh...

01:20:30.359 --> 01:20:32.526
National...
Ice Cream Day,

01:20:32.562 --> 01:20:33.394
if that's a thing?

01:20:33.462 --> 01:20:34.462
'Cause I just...

01:20:34.497 --> 01:20:35.996
any day

01:20:36.032 --> 01:20:38.499
that you will let me
make special for you...

01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:44.339
Finn...

01:20:44.373 --> 01:20:47.007
Stay in Bramble.

01:20:49.011 --> 01:20:51.312
It's where you belong.

01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:56.951
You told me that my dad
gave you a second chance.

01:20:59.722 --> 01:21:02.656
All I'm asking
is that you give me one too.

01:21:06.696 --> 01:21:07.696
Okay.

01:21:10.366 --> 01:21:11.465
Okay?

01:21:15.738 --> 01:21:18.239
Yes, I will stay.

01:21:18.307 --> 01:21:20.474
[laughs]
Oh, I could...

01:21:35.157 --> 01:21:37.324
Ewwwww.

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.827
Hey!

01:21:39.862 --> 01:21:41.662
Hi there.

01:21:43.833 --> 01:21:45.833
[Willa]: Hey,
buddy, um...

01:21:45.868 --> 01:21:49.870
What do you think about staying
at Bramble...

01:21:49.906 --> 01:21:51.205
the three of us?

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:53.641
Really?

01:21:53.676 --> 01:21:54.796
[Finn, laughing]
Oh, Scout...

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:57.878
Thanks, Mols,

01:21:57.914 --> 01:21:58.991
for making
my Christmas wish

01:21:59.015 --> 01:22:00.180
come true.

01:22:00.216 --> 01:22:01.515
[they laugh]

01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:03.651
What?
It's true.

01:22:03.686 --> 01:22:05.853
Well, that's what Christmas
is all about...

01:22:05.888 --> 01:22:08.489
to remind you
that wishes can come true.

01:22:08.524 --> 01:22:09.668
- That's right.
- Let's go see the tree.

01:22:09.692 --> 01:22:11.425
Okay, buddy.

01:22:20.036 --> 01:22:21.268
[tapping mug with spoon]

01:22:23.739 --> 01:22:26.340
Christmas magic is a tradition
here at Bramble House,

01:22:26.375 --> 01:22:29.510
but this year happens
to be even more special.

01:22:29.545 --> 01:22:31.178
[Finn]: I bet you say
that every year.

01:22:31.213 --> 01:22:32.479
Yes, I do,

01:22:32.515 --> 01:22:33.314
but this time, I mean it,

01:22:33.349 --> 01:22:35.249
because I...

01:22:35.318 --> 01:22:37.384
I found love...

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:38.519
and a new business
partner!

01:22:38.554 --> 01:22:40.054
And new friends.

01:22:40.089 --> 01:22:41.388
Absolutely...

01:22:41.424 --> 01:22:43.090
so here's to an
unforgettable Christmas,

01:22:43.159 --> 01:22:46.393
and a joyous New Year.

01:22:46.429 --> 01:22:48.228
Merry Christmas,
everybody.

01:22:48.264 --> 01:22:49.530
Hear, hear.
Cheers.

01:22:49.565 --> 01:22:51.065
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:53.767
- Can we open presents now?
- Yes, yes!

Yes.
