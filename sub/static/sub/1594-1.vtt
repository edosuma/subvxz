11:45.433 --> 11:49.100
(scoffs)
What's the law on sex with pets?

11:49.100 --> 11:51.700
From Karen Jackson.

11:51.700 --> 11:53.266
No way.

11:53.266 --> 11:54.533
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:54.533 --> 11:56.533
She got a "C" in physics.
Needed a "B."

11:59.166 --> 12:02.033
Or you, uh...

12:02.033 --> 12:03.700
you wouldn't have waited
this long to tell me.

12:03.700 --> 12:05.433
Oh, five hours.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.667
(laughs)
Okay, you're full of shit.

12:06.667 --> 12:09.266
Fuck you.

12:10.633 --> 12:13.533
You ever have a knob job?

12:13.533 --> 12:16.667
Once or twice.

12:16.667 --> 12:18.400
Oh. Wow.

12:18.400 --> 12:22.033
I didn't hear you
rushing to tell me.

12:22.033 --> 12:25.266
Yeah, well.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.767
I mean, I thought...

12:26.767 --> 12:28.700
we tell each
other everything.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.300
Unless...

12:42.033 --> 12:43.433
You got sucked off
by a guy.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.033
For instance.

12:49.033 --> 12:51.567
VERONICA (muffled):
No way. Lake Forest...

12:51.567 --> 12:52.600
Lake Forest is not Chicago.

12:52.600 --> 12:55.333
(raucous laughing)

12:55.333 --> 12:56.633
FIONA:
I'm not kidding, Steve.

12:56.633 --> 13:00.133
You are dead if he ever lays
eyes on you. And I mean dead.

13:00.133 --> 13:01.767
I nearly peed myself
when you hit him.

13:01.767 --> 13:04.033
Well, I did a little.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.033
(laughing)

13:05.033 --> 13:07.567
FIONA:
Hey.
Hi.

13:07.567 --> 13:09.433
Wait, how many of you guys
live here?

13:09.433 --> 13:10.700
VERONICA:
Not me, I'm one down.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.433
But the old guy next door
died in March, which I guess

13:12.433 --> 13:15.033
technically makes us
next-door neighbors.

13:15.033 --> 13:16.567
So you're a nurse,
Veronica?
Used to be.

13:16.567 --> 13:17.700
Lying bitch.

13:17.700 --> 13:19.300
She worked housekeeping
at Cook County,

13:19.300 --> 13:21.066
bedpans and shit-sheets.

13:21.066 --> 13:24.400
Fine. But I was offered
a place in the nursing school.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.333
Fine. But it never happened.

13:26.333 --> 13:29.200
They fired her for selling
medical supplies on eBay.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.600
Will you shut up?
We don't even know him.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.533
Steve.
Carl.

13:32.533 --> 13:34.200
Lip.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.333
Debbie.

13:35.333 --> 13:37.033
How you doing, Debbie?

13:37.033 --> 13:37.567
Nice watch.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.633
Oh, thanks. Panerai.

13:39.633 --> 13:42.266
What'd that set you back,
about six bills?

13:42.266 --> 13:44.266
Plus, Ian.

13:44.266 --> 13:46.567
Hey.

13:46.567 --> 13:49.467
Hey, Debbie, why do
they call him "Lip"?

13:49.467 --> 13:51.266
His real name's Philip.

13:51.266 --> 13:53.066
Yo, Veronica!

13:53.066 --> 13:55.367
You got my keys?

13:55.367 --> 13:56.767
What's going on here?

13:56.767 --> 13:58.200
This is Steve.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.633
Decked the bouncer at
Purgatory to defend my honor.

14:00.633 --> 14:01.767
(snorts)
My honor.

14:01.767 --> 14:03.333
Yeah? Which bouncer?

14:03.333 --> 14:04.300
Jimmy Clifton.

14:04.300 --> 14:06.367
Jimmy Cli...

14:06.367 --> 14:07.700
Well, Jesus, man,

14:07.700 --> 14:10.066
put it there!
Respect!

14:10.066 --> 14:12.333
Guy just stands there,
doesn't really do anything.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.767
Yeah, you'll be his
third conviction.

14:13.767 --> 14:15.100
Huh?
Third or fourth.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.667
Fourth. Yeah.

14:16.667 --> 14:18.533
I mean, after that much
practice, you would think

14:18.533 --> 14:20.600
the man would have manslaughter
down by now.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.166
No more fuck-ups like last time,

14:22.166 --> 14:23.667
like leaving his dad
still breathing.

14:23.667 --> 14:24.767
His dad.

14:24.767 --> 14:26.367
Yeah. Five years,

14:26.367 --> 14:30.300
over an '87 Monte Carlo with
200,000 miles on the odometer.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.133
Fucking Monte Carlo!

14:32.133 --> 14:34.100
Okay, come on, time for bed.
Up the wooden hill. Come on.

14:34.100 --> 14:36.200
CARL: It's not even
midnight yet!
DEBBIE:
Aw, man.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.700
Come on, come on, go!
Already?
Shut up.

14:37.700 --> 14:39.600
Move, move, move, move, come on.

14:39.600 --> 14:40.734
(groans)

14:40.734 --> 14:43.133
Yeah, let me take
one last look at you,

14:43.133 --> 14:44.166
while you're still alive!

14:44.166 --> 14:46.166
(laughing)

14:46.166 --> 14:47.300
Here.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.300
What, that's his?

14:54.300 --> 14:57.000
Yeah. Well,
company car.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.367
What kind of company?

14:59.367 --> 15:00.667
Internet startup?

15:02.600 --> 15:05.400
Earning what?

15:05.400 --> 15:07.000
Couple mil a year.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.100
High school dropout.

15:08.100 --> 15:11.700
Got a job as a janitor
in this small tech firm.

15:11.700 --> 15:13.567
Within a year, he owned it.

15:13.567 --> 15:15.200
Made his first billion by 20.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.567
Two Jags, controlling
interest in the Red Wings,

15:18.567 --> 15:21.166
10,000 employees
kissing his ass.

15:21.166 --> 15:23.233
"Yes, boss. No, boss."

15:23.233 --> 15:25.200
Why shouldn't he
ride around in style?

15:31.033 --> 15:32.300
Oh, you just made that up.

15:32.300 --> 15:33.300
(snorts laughter)

15:33.300 --> 15:36.033
What...?

15:36.033 --> 15:37.333
Why do you do that?

15:37.333 --> 15:38.533
Your face!

15:38.533 --> 15:40.033
How is that even funny?
It's not even funny...

15:40.033 --> 15:41.533
How the fuck would I
know how much he earns,

15:41.533 --> 15:42.633
you twisted dumb prick?

15:42.633 --> 15:44.567
I'm not a dumb prick.

15:44.567 --> 15:47.500
Kevin, I just met
the guy an hour ago.

15:47.500 --> 15:48.633
Take back "dumb prick"!

15:48.633 --> 15:50.633
Hi, nice to meet you.
I'm Veronica.

15:50.633 --> 15:52.233
What's your pre-tax income?

15:52.233 --> 15:53.600
Well, you sure didn't mind

15:53.600 --> 15:54.633
watching him take his
shirt off, now, did you? Huh?

15:54.633 --> 15:56.700
Not one bit.

15:56.700 --> 15:58.333
In fact,
if you hadn't walked in,

15:58.333 --> 16:02.166
Fiona and I were going to knock
him down and tag-team him.

16:02.166 --> 16:05.133
Now I guess
I'm stuck with you.

16:05.133 --> 16:07.133
Hold on.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.100
The Fiona tag-team,
is that an option?

16:09.100 --> 16:11.133
(both chuckling)

16:11.133 --> 16:13.567
'Cause you know, you can
throw that in the mix...
(laughing)

16:13.567 --> 16:14.700
Anytime you like it, too...

16:14.700 --> 16:16.333
I'll be doing it, all right...

16:16.333 --> 16:17.300
(both laughing)

16:17.300 --> 16:19.233
(heels clack down the stairs)

16:24.033 --> 16:27.600
All quiet up
the "wooden hill"?

16:27.600 --> 16:29.500
As quiet as
it ever gets.

16:29.500 --> 16:32.200
Straight answer: if I hadn't
busted my skull for you tonight,

16:32.200 --> 16:33.633
would you have
looked at me twice?

16:33.633 --> 16:36.467
Who's saying that
I looked twice?

16:36.467 --> 16:38.533
Oh, you did, then.

16:43.367 --> 16:45.400
I can't.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.300
(sighs)

16:50.233 --> 16:53.734
You know, 90% of the world's
problems are caused by

16:53.734 --> 16:55.767
tiny words that
come in pairs.

16:55.767 --> 16:59.000
I mean, we're healthy and we're
happy, but when people ask,

16:59.000 --> 17:01.233
we say...

17:01.233 --> 17:03.100
"Not bad."

17:05.166 --> 17:07.100
You know, the first time
that I saw you dancing,

17:07.100 --> 17:11.367
about a month back at Crobar,

17:11.367 --> 17:14.767
I was desperate
to buy you a drink.

17:14.767 --> 17:19.700
You know, normally I'm shy,
so I told myself: I can't.

17:19.700 --> 17:24.533
She won't. We wouldn't.

17:24.533 --> 17:28.166
And then tonight
I see you there again.

17:28.166 --> 17:31.467
All the indications
being that I'm getting...

17:31.467 --> 17:33.000
(zipper being unfastened)

17:33.000 --> 17:35.233
...a second chance
to make a good impression.

17:35.233 --> 17:37.166
Tell me to stop,
and I'll stop.

17:50.033 --> 17:52.400
Take it slower, slower,
slower, slower.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.266
Slower.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.433
(whispers):
Slower.

17:59.433 --> 18:01.400
Slower.

18:05.033 --> 18:07.166
(dishes clattering)

18:15.300 --> 18:17.166
(gasps)

18:20.700 --> 18:23.033
(dishes clattering)

18:24.700 --> 18:27.166
(moaning)

18:27.166 --> 18:28.767
(thud, clattering)

18:28.767 --> 18:31.033
(moaning)

18:39.333 --> 18:41.633
Ah! Ah! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

18:41.633 --> 18:42.567
Almost... almost...

18:43.700 --> 18:45.033
(knock on door)

18:45.033 --> 18:47.166
(panting)

18:47.166 --> 18:49.533
MAN (outside): Fiona?
Shit. Shit, shit!

18:51.633 --> 18:53.767
MAN (outside):
Fiona!

18:55.100 --> 18:58.000
Shit.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
MAN:
Fiona, are you home?

19:07.200 --> 19:09.533
Is Fiona in?

19:09.533 --> 19:12.600
Uh... she's upstairs.

19:17.567 --> 19:19.133
I'll go get her.

19:21.700 --> 19:23.033
Hey.
Oh.

19:23.033 --> 19:25.033
Yeah, uh, cops
looking for you.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.100
Stay here.

19:31.100 --> 19:32.767
DEBBIE:
Liam.

19:32.767 --> 19:35.066
Liam?

19:35.066 --> 19:39.000
FRANK (slurred):
You... you...

19:39.000 --> 19:42.100
(slurred ranting)

19:43.533 --> 19:45.734
I wouldn't put him
anywhere near a carpet

19:45.734 --> 19:47.166
till his pants dry a bit.

19:47.166 --> 19:48.166
Thanks, Tony.

19:48.166 --> 19:49.233
(Frank yells)

19:49.233 --> 19:51.133
See you, Fiona.

19:53.734 --> 19:54.667
Who the hell is that?

19:56.400 --> 19:58.500
My dad.

20:05.600 --> 20:09.033
You just leave him
there all night?

20:09.033 --> 20:11.200
He's never there
when I get up.

20:15.233 --> 20:18.233
So, uh, who's the little guy?

20:18.233 --> 20:19.166
Liam?

20:19.166 --> 20:22.266
Liam's my brother.

20:29.433 --> 20:31.533
(sighs)

20:35.333 --> 20:38.266
(door opens, closes)

20:40.300 --> 20:42.300
(people speaking indistinctly
in distance)

20:46.200 --> 20:48.300
(car alarm chirps)

21:19.433 --> 21:21.500
Rita.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.333
Anne's school called.
She's sick.

21:26.333 --> 21:28.133
Everything up to 204
is clean.

21:28.133 --> 21:29.300
I should be back in
a couple of hours.

21:29.300 --> 21:30.600
Raul won't care?

21:30.600 --> 21:33.600
He smoked his lunch again.
He won't even know.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.066
I'm making
tamales tonight.

21:35.066 --> 21:36.200
I'll drop off a dozen.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.200
Okay.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.367
Adios...

21:38.367 --> 21:40.467
Oh, and take all the
toilet paper you need.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.400
Okay.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.066
You ready, big man?

21:44.066 --> 21:46.066
Let's do it.
Come on. Here we go.

21:52.300 --> 21:56.100
FRANK:
Kevin, did you miss me, dear?

21:56.100 --> 21:57.500
A beer and a bump. And, uh...

21:57.500 --> 21:59.233
Billy, you having one?

21:59.233 --> 22:01.233
Have one!

22:01.233 --> 22:02.700
(chuckles)

22:02.700 --> 22:05.000
Go away, Frank.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.500
A pen, Mr. Beerkeep,
it is disability day.

22:09.100 --> 22:11.200
Disability people haven't
caught up with you yet?

22:11.200 --> 22:13.066
I thought they had some guy

22:13.066 --> 22:15.367
following you around
with a camera.

22:15.367 --> 22:18.433
They can follow me around
all they want to,

22:18.433 --> 22:22.367
but they have to actually
catch me doing something.

22:26.266 --> 22:28.200
What's with the crowd?

22:28.200 --> 22:29.533
Layoff at the
Chrysler plant.

22:29.533 --> 22:30.734
You see?

22:30.734 --> 22:33.200
That's the problem with working.

22:33.200 --> 22:36.266
Too much instability. Stress!

22:40.200 --> 22:43.300
What the fuck is this?

22:43.300 --> 22:46.266
What's left, after I settled
out last month's bar tab.

22:46.266 --> 22:47.233
(whistles, groans)

22:47.233 --> 22:49.567
Better start a new one, then.

22:49.567 --> 22:54.266
Oh! And a round for all
my friends from the UAW.

22:54.266 --> 22:56.100
(cheering)

22:57.066 --> 22:59.667
Wow. Really?

22:59.667 --> 23:01.000
Fuck no.

23:05.033 --> 23:06.734
(rhythmic tapping)

23:06.734 --> 23:09.000
(tapping continues, washing
machine humming quietly)

23:13.333 --> 23:15.266
(knocking)

23:15.266 --> 23:17.400
(washing machine stops)

23:23.600 --> 23:25.533
Hi.

23:25.533 --> 23:28.567
Wondering what your schedule's
like on Friday.

23:28.567 --> 23:31.533
Uh, I've got a...

23:31.533 --> 23:32.533
I've got a party.

23:32.533 --> 23:33.533
Want a chaperone?

23:33.533 --> 23:35.100
You're not eligible.

23:35.100 --> 23:36.567
Right. Chick thing?

23:38.667 --> 23:40.433
You're not
that desperate.

23:40.433 --> 23:42.433
Wanting to see you again
is desperate?

23:42.433 --> 23:45.400
No, feeling like you have
to-- that's desperate.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.533
Come on, you can
get laid anywhere.

23:47.533 --> 23:50.033
Oh, so I'm only here for a fuck?

23:50.033 --> 23:52.233
Never crossed your mind?

23:52.233 --> 23:54.633
Just when you think
you've collared your dream girl,

23:54.633 --> 23:55.700
her incontinent,

23:55.700 --> 23:58.133
alcoholic father appears,
wrecks everything,

23:58.133 --> 23:59.567
and she's
blaming you?

23:59.567 --> 24:00.600
Your dream girl?

24:00.600 --> 24:03.233
We had drunken sex
on my kitchen floor.

24:03.233 --> 24:04.266
(chuckles):
Pretty sad.

24:04.266 --> 24:05.767
Quit pretending
you don't even know me.

24:05.767 --> 24:07.433
You weren't that drunk.

24:07.433 --> 24:09.533
Hey, it's Phillip.

24:09.533 --> 24:11.467
Hey, it's, uh,
Dead Man Walking.

24:11.467 --> 24:13.100
Jimmy Clifton called today
looking for you.

24:13.100 --> 24:14.300
No school?

24:14.300 --> 24:16.300
Nah, I got some
teeth pulled today.

24:16.300 --> 24:17.100
Wisdom teeth?

24:17.100 --> 24:19.133
Sugar rot.
Ah.

24:19.133 --> 24:20.433
You know, little known fact:

24:20.433 --> 24:21.467
don't just chew your food
on one side,

24:21.467 --> 24:22.667
'cause it can buckle your jaw,

24:22.667 --> 24:24.133
which will buckle your hips
and affect your posture.

24:24.133 --> 24:25.300
Oh, that's a fact?

24:25.300 --> 24:26.633
Skeletal fact.
Lip.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.600
Hey, um,

24:29.600 --> 24:32.333
talk out of your ass
with that much conviction,

24:32.333 --> 24:34.200
you end up needing
a much bigger toothbrush.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.333
That's a anal fact.

24:36.333 --> 24:38.200
(chuckles)

24:38.200 --> 24:39.467
(washing machine humming)

24:41.066 --> 24:44.767
Listen, thank you for trying
to get my purse back

24:44.767 --> 24:47.100
and, uh, stuff.

24:47.100 --> 24:48.300
But, uh...
Stuff?

24:48.300 --> 24:49.734
I'm not looking.

24:49.734 --> 24:52.400
Not right now.

24:54.567 --> 24:56.200
Okay.

24:56.200 --> 24:59.633
Is it all right if I leave
my number for when you might be?

25:02.734 --> 25:04.200
LIP:
Relax, okay?

25:04.200 --> 25:05.500
No.
No, no, you're
gonna like it.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.500
What am I, what am I even
gonna say, all right?

25:07.500 --> 25:10.200
You just got to keep
talking about science.

25:10.200 --> 25:11.667
I don't know
anything about science.

25:11.667 --> 25:15.300
Okay, so just read from
the table of elements.

25:15.300 --> 25:18.100
Cerium, erbium,
praseodymium.

25:19.567 --> 25:20.433
(knocking)

25:24.233 --> 25:25.367
Mrs. Jackson.

25:25.367 --> 25:26.767
Oh!

25:26.767 --> 25:28.767
Karen is thrilled with you.

25:28.767 --> 25:32.233
She got an "A"
on her physics midterm!

25:32.233 --> 25:33.367
Karen!

25:33.367 --> 25:35.066
Honey, your little helper
is here.

25:35.066 --> 25:38.266
This is my brother Ian.

25:38.266 --> 25:40.433
Um, I'm out
of plastic bags.

25:40.433 --> 25:43.233
Why don't you leave your shoes
out here where they can breathe.

25:43.233 --> 25:44.533
Sure.

25:47.233 --> 25:48.266
Mix these two together...

25:48.266 --> 25:50.133
IAN:
Erbium, cerium,

25:50.133 --> 25:52.700
praseodymium, magnesium...

25:52.700 --> 25:56.266
You kids want some homemade
lime chicken chimichangas?

25:56.266 --> 25:58.367
Um, no, no,
thanks, Sheila.

25:58.367 --> 26:00.100
I think we're fine.
No? All right.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.600
Uh, praseodymium, uh,

26:02.600 --> 26:04.367
magnesium, sulfur...

26:04.367 --> 26:06.467
MAN:
All right, I'm off to work.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.400
Hey, fellas.

26:10.467 --> 26:12.500
Where's Karen?
Uh, her room.

26:12.500 --> 26:15.166
I think Google Earth
for a GPS reference

26:15.166 --> 26:16.533
on where Isaac Newton
was born.

26:16.533 --> 26:18.533
(grunting softly)

26:18.533 --> 26:20.300
SHEILA:
Guess what I made
for your lunch.

26:20.300 --> 26:24.000
Cornish game hen
with Asian pear.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.400
No.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.433
Wild salmon with
baby carrots.

26:27.433 --> 26:29.633
No.

26:29.633 --> 26:31.567
Kiss and I'll tell.

26:33.700 --> 26:36.633
I'll find out what I got when
I open the damn box, all right?

26:53.500 --> 26:55.533
All right, I'm late,
Karen, honey!

26:55.533 --> 26:56.767
I guess I'll see you
in the morning.!

27:01.533 --> 27:02.600
What's she hiding for?

27:05.400 --> 27:07.300
What are you hiding...

27:07.300 --> 27:08.734
...for?

27:10.200 --> 27:12.467
Ah, sweet Jesus.

barely got his foot in

them from...
Ow!

Yeah, just please don't...
don't touch it.

top of the freezer.

Yeah.
Two ice packs.

28:31.767 --> 28:33.000

Yeah.

get it X-rayed?

Thanks. Tell us something
we didn't know five hours ago.

28:43.133 --> 28:44.266

you done?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.700
What have you done?!

is it better coming
around the back?

Yeah, but that's not ours.

Well, it's paid for.

No.

30:47.734 --> 30:49.233
I've done everything
in my control...

30:49.233 --> 30:50.667
What did I say?!

Well, she didn't
reap this from me,

30:54.533 --> 30:56.233
I'll tell you that.

30:56.233 --> 30:57.500
Reap what?

30:57.500 --> 30:59.633
Wh-what are you reaping now?

30:59.633 --> 31:01.433
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

31:01.433 --> 31:03.000

Hey, you honor

31:12.400 --> 31:14.133

31:14.133 --> 31:16.300
Don't try blaming me for this!

31:17.600 --> 31:20.000

Hello.

31:40.200 --> 31:41.533
How much you pay for it?

31:41.533 --> 31:42.567
I'm not telling you that.

31:42.567 --> 31:43.633
It's a gift.

31:43.633 --> 31:45.333
So you'd remember
the phone number,

31:45.333 --> 31:46.300
which obviously worked.

31:46.300 --> 31:47.533
Your washer's in the yard, okay?

31:47.533 --> 31:49.133
We don't need it,
I don't want it.

31:49.133 --> 31:51.767
So you got to come pick it up
before it starts rusting.

31:51.767 --> 31:53.066
Oh, is it?

31:54.266 --> 31:56.100
No.

31:56.100 --> 31:57.300
Did the guy connect it?

31:58.300 --> 32:00.467
Yes.

32:00.467 --> 32:01.633
It's working okay?

32:01.633 --> 32:03.400
It's not my favorite color.

32:03.400 --> 32:04.533
Oh, so you've tried it.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.467

when do pork rinds

32:28.467 --> 32:29.767
actually come
from a pig?

32:29.767 --> 32:31.433
Ian, I am the one
that signs your check.

32:31.433 --> 32:33.200
What's bad for him is
really bad for you.

32:33.200 --> 32:35.133
If you are stupid enough
to start lying for him...

32:35.133 --> 32:36.300
They're just corn chips
with fake hair,

32:36.300 --> 32:38.300
fake corn even.

32:38.300 --> 32:39.233
Last warning.

32:39.233 --> 32:40.400
You get yourself
to that mosque

32:40.400 --> 32:42.266
so your dad stops
blaming me for the fact

32:42.266 --> 32:43.600
that we're all going to hell.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.433
And talk to
your mother.

32:45.433 --> 32:46.500
She won't talk to me.

32:46.500 --> 32:47.767
I can't force her
to take her meds.

32:47.767 --> 32:49.300
Well, I don't want
the cops dragging me

32:49.300 --> 32:51.667
out of bed again at 4:00 a.m.
because she's out in the alley

32:51.667 --> 32:53.033
yelling that the CIA
is stealing her trash.

32:53.033 --> 32:55.200
But that happened, didn't it?

32:55.200 --> 32:57.500
Once.

32:57.500 --> 32:58.633
Four years ago, yes.

32:58.633 --> 33:00.367
But now she's locked
in the basement,

33:00.367 --> 33:01.734
making a helmet
out of tinfoil.

33:01.734 --> 33:03.400
Enough's enough!

33:03.400 --> 33:04.333
Boys, come
on, let's go.

33:04.333 --> 33:05.600
Get in the car.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.700
Now, I have to take
the boys to Cub Scouts

33:07.700 --> 33:09.600
at the mosque before all
the carpets are taken.

33:09.600 --> 33:12.300

to take her Thorazine.

33:12.300 --> 33:14.333
No, boys, no candy.
Come on, let's go.

33:14.333 --> 33:15.767
We're gonna be late.
Let's go, go, go, go, go.

33:15.767 --> 33:17.133
No more!

33:17.133 --> 33:18.400

33:18.400 --> 33:19.400

33:53.533 --> 33:56.600
Just tell me
you didn't go

33:56.600 --> 33:59.400
and get some
girl pregnant.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.533
No worries.

34:00.533 --> 34:02.467
(chuckles softly)

34:02.467 --> 34:03.533
He hates me.

34:03.533 --> 34:05.000
(snoring)

34:05.000 --> 34:07.133
You just,
you look more like mom

34:07.133 --> 34:09.000

34:09.000 --> 34:10.266
You probably scare him.

34:10.266 --> 34:11.400
Yeah?

34:11.400 --> 34:12.667
Yeah.

34:12.667 --> 34:14.133
He ain't seen nothing yet.

34:15.166 --> 34:17.433
Did he give you money
for the field trip?

34:17.433 --> 34:19.133
I'll pay my own way, all right?

34:20.266 --> 34:22.533
No, you won't.

Well, at least I can.

34:43.200 --> 34:45.133

34:46.233 --> 34:49.367
Jesus, Fiona,
if all you want

34:49.367 --> 34:51.400
is to be needed then,

34:51.400 --> 34:53.266
congratulations.

34:53.266 --> 34:56.066
(snoring)
You've got yourself a job

35:21.533 --> 35:24.166
Hey. Get up.

Good job, Fiona.

35:52.734 --> 35:56.433
I don't know how I could
do this without you.

35:56.433 --> 35:59.533

36:02.266 --> 36:04.200

Hello.

37:03.066 --> 37:05.266
If that wasn't bullshit,
what was I wearing?

37:05.266 --> 37:08.133
Huh?
First time you saw me,
if that wasn't a lie.

37:08.133 --> 37:12.000
Black top with gold trim,

37:12.000 --> 37:16.600
black shiny jeans,
thin shoes-- straps...

37:18.133 --> 37:21.300
Sandals.
With your hair pinned high.

37:23.133 --> 37:26.400
Dangly gold earrings
that made me smile.

37:29.033 --> 37:33.166
A big watch-- too big,
so it slid up your arm.

37:33.166 --> 37:35.633
But it looked great.

37:35.633 --> 37:40.166
And you were dancing
next to red-haired girl

37:40.166 --> 37:42.200
in a green dress.

37:48.667 --> 37:51.667
Yeah, yeah, Jenna.
It was Jenna's birthday.

37:51.667 --> 37:54.033
So you were...
you were watching her,

37:54.033 --> 37:56.100
who's a lot better looking
than me.

37:56.100 --> 37:58.300
You think so? Really?

37:58.300 --> 38:00.500
Yeah, so how come you're
not stalking Jenna?

38:00.500 --> 38:03.400
Because you... you think like
that and Jenna doesn't.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.367
Jenna dances for an audience.

38:05.367 --> 38:08.734
You dance like there's no one
else in the room.

38:08.734 --> 38:12.100
Your life's not simple, Fiona,

38:12.100 --> 38:15.166
and you can't stop it from
showing because you're no fake.

38:15.166 --> 38:17.266
You're not lost,
you don't need finding.

38:17.266 --> 38:18.767
This whole city belongs
to the Jennas,

38:18.767 --> 38:20.367
but I'm sick of them.

38:20.367 --> 38:24.200
I swear, Fiona, you're nothing
like anyone I've ever met.

38:24.200 --> 38:28.100
You make me want to enjoy
my life again.

and has more money than sense

40:45.633 --> 40:47.166
is somehow more socially
acceptable

40:47.166 --> 40:48.500

(chuckles)

49:09.567 --> 49:11.433
It's not a case
of whether or not

49:11.433 --> 49:12.567
I agree.
It's a fact.

49:12.567 --> 49:14.567
If I were a single
parent, we'd be on...

49:14.567 --> 49:15.633
Aren't you
a single parent?

49:15.633 --> 49:16.700
"Yeah, but if I had tits..."

49:16.700 --> 49:18.633
Yeah, but if I
had tits, Steve,

49:18.633 --> 49:20.200
they would double
the money.

49:20.200 --> 49:23.300
If you're a guy,
they don't want to
fucking hear it.

49:23.300 --> 49:24.266
I-I get it, Frank,
so it's,

49:24.266 --> 49:25.300
"Prove you're looking
for work."

49:25.300 --> 49:26.467
Oh, he's on disability.

49:26.467 --> 49:27.533
Yeah? For what?

49:27.533 --> 49:29.467
A tragedy really. I gave my life
to that company.

49:29.467 --> 49:30.767
You worked there
a week.

49:30.767 --> 49:32.133
STEVE:
What happened?

49:32.133 --> 49:34.367
Uh, slaughterhouse, poultry.
(loud rock playing)

49:34.367 --> 49:35.734
Dangerous work.

49:35.734 --> 49:37.767
Doing my job,
unsuspecting,

49:37.767 --> 49:40.734
when out of nowhere
I am slammed in the ribs

49:40.734 --> 49:42.467
by a headless
flying chicken.

49:42.467 --> 49:45.200
I was lucky-- it
almost missed me.

49:45.200 --> 49:48.333
And what do I get for my pain
and suffering?

49:48.333 --> 49:50.400
Followed around

49:50.400 --> 49:52.734
by a video camera!

49:52.734 --> 49:54.400
Where's the
trust, Steve?

49:54.400 --> 49:55.400
The sacred bond

49:55.400 --> 49:57.633
between employer
and employee?

49:57.633 --> 50:00.133
Gone, Steve.
It's gone.

50:00.133 --> 50:02.467
How's a guy supposed to work,
hurt, with kids this age?

50:02.467 --> 50:04.367
Hello? Thank you!
Yeah.

50:04.367 --> 50:07.066
Exactly. Excellent!
Excellent.

50:07.066 --> 50:10.100
And her mother,
God rest her soul,
Dad, stop it!

50:10.100 --> 50:12.266

50:33.533 --> 50:36.033
What's the one thing
that we needed?

50:36.033 --> 50:37.066
One word?

50:37.066 --> 50:38.767
One thing?

it doesn't really matter

he's long gone now anyways,

wakes up earlier than I do,

56:02.133 --> 56:04.100

I never eat breakfast,

56:04.100 --> 56:05.266

it's her favorite meal.
