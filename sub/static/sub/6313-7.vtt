09:37.053 --> 09:39.221
My large stature can keep you safe.

09:39.304 --> 09:42.182
I'm a great negotiator,
get you those primo prices.

09:42.266 --> 09:43.308
And I can help you carry it home.

09:43.392 --> 09:44.852
That sounds great.

09:44.936 --> 09:45.853
Though you definitely didn't need

09:45.937 --> 09:47.021
to provide three reasons.

09:47.105 --> 09:48.647
Nobody else was itching to go.

09:48.731 --> 09:50.649
Well, like I said, I'm a great negotiator.

09:52.902 --> 09:55.696
So what's it like being a giant?

09:55.780 --> 09:57.115
It's pretty good.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.950
I always have a good view at a concert.

09:59.033 --> 10:00.785
Planes are tough, though.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.369
What's it like being tiny?

10:02.453 --> 10:03.788
Oh, it's fine.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.665
Planes are great. Concerts are tough.

10:06.749 --> 10:09.334
I wonder what experiences
are similar for us.

10:09.418 --> 10:12.922
Hmm, hunger, love, bad smells--

10:13.005 --> 10:14.006
Mouse!

10:14.090 --> 10:15.549
What? What? Where?

10:15.633 --> 10:17.217
It ran right in front of me.

10:17.301 --> 10:19.428
Oh, okay, well,
I think it's gone now, so...

10:19.511 --> 10:20.846
It's disgusting.

10:20.930 --> 10:24.475
Oh, oh, you seem pretty shaken up.

10:24.558 --> 10:26.060
Yeah.

10:26.144 --> 10:29.897
Do you--
You want to go get some boba tea?

10:29.981 --> 10:31.607
Yeah, boba.

10:31.690 --> 10:33.067
Okay. It's okay.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.321
Hey.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.739
What's up with black dudes
and their barbers?

10:38.823 --> 10:40.074
Why's it such a big deal?

10:40.158 --> 10:41.533
I could be a black barber.

10:41.617 --> 10:42.534
No, you couldn't.

10:42.618 --> 10:44.203
It's super hard.

10:44.286 --> 10:45.997
You can't fuck up the line
above their forehead.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.039
It's got to be straight.

10:47.123 --> 10:48.290
Oh, what,
so I can't shave a straight line?

10:48.373 --> 10:50.001
Come on, of course I can do that.

10:50.084 --> 10:52.128
Oh, fuck, I think this dude
over here is jerking off.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.340
Damn it.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.926
Third masturbator I've seen this year.
Creepy dudes, man.

10:59.010 --> 10:59.969
We'll just go over to the other side.

11:00.052 --> 11:01.053
No, no, no, no, wait.

11:01.137 --> 11:02.680
We can't just keep
letting this shit slide.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.056
We got to do something.

11:04.140 --> 11:05.349
Well, I'm all for doing something,

11:05.432 --> 11:07.101
but what would we do, exactly?

11:07.185 --> 11:08.393
What if we took a video of him

11:08.477 --> 11:10.188
and posted that shit all over Facebook?

11:10.270 --> 11:11.522
He'd never be able to get a job again.

11:11.605 --> 11:12.982
So we Internet shame him?

11:13.065 --> 11:14.399
I mean, in theory, it works.

11:14.483 --> 11:16.068
But it's kind of a long-term play.

11:16.152 --> 11:18.737
And who knows if the clip will go viral,
you know?

11:18.821 --> 11:20.156
Maybe blogs will pick it up,

11:20.239 --> 11:21.490
maybe someone makes a meme, but--

11:21.573 --> 11:22.825
Okay, okay, okay, you right.

11:22.908 --> 11:24.660
Internet's too fickle.

11:24.743 --> 11:26.078
Oh, I got it.

11:26.162 --> 11:27.621
What if we make a citizen's arrest?

11:27.705 --> 11:28.998
What?

11:29.081 --> 11:30.208
You've heard that before, right?

11:30.290 --> 11:31.583
"I'm making a citizen's arrest."

11:31.667 --> 11:33.127
If you're a citizen,
you can arrest people.

11:33.211 --> 11:34.461
Man, that shit ain't real.

11:34.545 --> 11:36.338
How we both know the phrase?

11:36.421 --> 11:37.631
Good point.

11:37.715 --> 11:39.008
But then what? What we gonna do?

11:39.091 --> 11:40.509
Ask the conductor to call the police?

11:40.592 --> 11:41.802
The conductor? There's no conductor.

11:41.886 --> 11:42.761
It's the G train.

11:42.845 --> 11:44.555
It's not fucking Shining Time Station.

11:44.638 --> 11:46.015
Fine. We'll call the cops after.

11:46.098 --> 11:47.307
But we're gonna need evidence, though.

11:47.391 --> 11:48.934
Okay.

11:49.018 --> 11:50.769
I'll act like I'm looking at a photo.

11:50.853 --> 11:52.771
Oh, yeah. Oh, hey, yeah.

11:52.855 --> 11:54.565
Look at that.

11:54.648 --> 11:55.941
All right,
that's enough footage, all right.

11:56.025 --> 11:57.235
Let's arrest this fool.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.485
Okay, so on three, we both go,

11:58.569 --> 11:59.862
"Stop what you're doing!

11:59.945 --> 12:01.113
This is a citizen's arrest!" Right?

12:01.197 --> 12:02.865
One, two, three.

12:02.948 --> 12:04.783
Stop what you're doing!
This is a citizen's arrest!

12:04.867 --> 12:06.326
This is real.

12:06.410 --> 12:08.079
This is a real thing
that people can really do.

12:08.162 --> 12:09.621
What are you talking about?
I'm zipping my jacket.

12:09.705 --> 12:11.123
Oh, really?
Is this how you zip your jacket?

12:11.207 --> 12:12.499
Man, we got video of you jerking off.

12:12.583 --> 12:13.876
Yeah, I filmed it all on my phone,

12:13.959 --> 12:15.502
and we're gonna show it to the cops.

12:15.586 --> 12:16.670
What the hell are you talking about, pal?

12:16.754 --> 12:17.796
I wasn't jerking off.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.090
I saw you touching yourself.

12:19.173 --> 12:20.340
You're disgusting.

12:20.424 --> 12:22.927
Ooh, looks like she saw it.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.262
Yeah, I saw it too.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.846
I'm going to the conductor
and I'm telling him

12:25.930 --> 12:27.347
to call the police.

12:27.431 --> 12:28.807
See, I told you there was a conductor.

12:28.891 --> 12:30.142
I thought it was all run by computers.

12:30.226 --> 12:31.810
Dude, you're busted, all right?

12:31.894 --> 12:32.853
And when this train stops,
there's gonna be cops

12:32.937 --> 12:33.854
out there waiting for you.

12:33.938 --> 12:34.980
God damn it!

12:35.064 --> 12:36.440
We did it!

12:41.653 --> 12:42.821
Whoa, whoa.

12:42.905 --> 12:44.198
Did you talk price with this guy?

12:44.282 --> 12:45.866
Well, he has it listed for 300 bucks,

12:45.950 --> 12:47.034
but I'm gonna try
and talk him down to 200.

12:47.118 --> 12:48.535
Right, right, right.

12:48.619 --> 12:50.037
Listen, I'm an expert on Craigslist.

12:50.121 --> 12:52.664
It's where I get all my silverware,
all my musical instruments,

12:52.748 --> 12:54.541
all my Gremlins merchandise.

12:54.625 --> 12:56.877
Here's the pro move: good cop, bad cop.

12:56.961 --> 12:58.212
You walk in, say,

12:58.296 --> 13:00.422
"Oh, I love this couch. I'll take it."

13:00.505 --> 13:02.800
I'll say,
"Uh-uh! We're still shopping around."

13:02.883 --> 13:03.968
Got it?

13:04.051 --> 13:04.969
Got it.

13:05.052 --> 13:06.804
Buzz him.

13:11.016 --> 13:12.184
- Hey!
- Hi!

13:12.268 --> 13:13.602
- I'm Blake.
- Rachel.

13:13.685 --> 13:15.146
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

13:15.229 --> 13:16.772
So this is the couch.

13:16.855 --> 13:19.441
Oh, my God, it's amazing.

13:22.653 --> 13:23.904
You kidding me?

13:25.030 --> 13:27.158
I don't know, Arnold.
It might be a little big.

13:27.241 --> 13:29.368
Maybe we should shop around a little bit?

13:29.451 --> 13:31.912
Oh, no,
you make room for a piece this nice.

13:31.996 --> 13:33.705
It's so soft.

13:33.789 --> 13:36.208
Why is it only $300? What's the catch?

13:36.292 --> 13:39.544
No catch, I'm moving out of the country,
so I just need to get rid of it.

13:39.628 --> 13:42.840
These pillows feel like they're filled
with angel feathers.

13:45.343 --> 13:47.261
Can I actually talk to you
over here for a minute?

13:47.345 --> 13:49.013
Yeah, sure.

13:51.140 --> 13:53.767
Ladies and gentlemen,
due to police activity,

13:53.851 --> 13:55.102
we're being held momentarily...

13:55.186 --> 13:56.103
Hey, Officers.

13:56.187 --> 13:57.146
We got the masturbator.

13:57.229 --> 13:58.272
He's right here.

13:58.356 --> 13:59.606
Yeah.

13:59.690 --> 14:00.774
You have the right to remain silent.

14:00.858 --> 14:02.026
Don't do that.

14:02.109 --> 14:03.110
Sorry.

14:04.444 --> 14:07.489
Okay, guys, wait here for a sec.
I'll be right back to get your statements.

14:11.369 --> 14:12.286
Hey.

14:12.370 --> 14:13.620
Can I ask you something?

14:13.704 --> 14:14.997
Why would you do this?

14:15.080 --> 14:17.166
Why not just jerk off at home
like everybody else?

14:17.249 --> 14:19.459
Honestly? It's just what I'm into.

14:19.543 --> 14:20.878
Do you like the idea of someone seeing it,

14:20.961 --> 14:22.587
or is it just the act of doing it?

14:22.671 --> 14:24.423
What do I look like,
a psychiatrist to you?

14:24.506 --> 14:26.842
I don't know. It's just something I do.

14:27.092 --> 14:30.929
What if society told youse you couldn't do
the sexual acts that you liked?

14:31.013 --> 14:34.350
Well, the sexual acts we like
don't traumatize other people.

14:34.433 --> 14:36.018
Ha, but if they did,

14:36.101 --> 14:38.312
I bet you'd have some
real internal conflict.

14:38.396 --> 14:39.563
Welcome to my world.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.232
All right.

14:41.315 --> 14:43.984
Stop making me weirdly
kind of sympathize with you.

14:47.612 --> 14:49.407
You said you took a video of the incident?

14:49.489 --> 14:50.741
Yeah.

14:50.824 --> 14:52.159
Can you send it to this number?

14:52.243 --> 14:53.285
Whoa.

14:53.369 --> 14:55.913
So I'm texting you a video
of him jerking off?

14:55.996 --> 14:57.039
This is weird.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.709
Come on, it is a little weird.

15:07.299 --> 15:14.348
So I don't know how to say this,
but my brother is a little bit off.

15:14.432 --> 15:17.101
Yeah, he was such a sweet kid,
but when he was 15,

15:17.184 --> 15:18.810
he had an accident.

15:18.894 --> 15:21.105
His favorite show was Home Improvement.

15:21.188 --> 15:22.522
And it came on,

15:22.606 --> 15:24.983
and he heard the...
sound,

15:25.067 --> 15:26.944
and he got so excited.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.528
And he ran down to the basement to watch,

15:28.612 --> 15:30.822
and he slammed his head
on the low ceiling.

15:30.906 --> 15:33.409
Poor kid didn't know
how tall he had gotten.

15:33.492 --> 15:36.536
And, um,
he's just never been the same since.

15:39.623 --> 15:41.666
He really loves this couch.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.502
But we don't have a lot of money.

15:43.585 --> 15:46.088
Is there any way we can
have it for 200 bucks?

15:46.171 --> 15:47.465
Yeah, sure.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.258
I need to clear everything out anyway.

15:49.341 --> 15:51.218
Found some candy in the couch.

15:51.302 --> 15:52.677
Love you, couch.

15:56.307 --> 15:58.642
I just don't believe in vaccinations.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.144
I just don't.

16:00.227 --> 16:02.313
How can injecting
a little bit of a disease

16:02.396 --> 16:03.981
help you not get the disease?

16:04.064 --> 16:06.358
You're just putting the disease in you.

16:06.442 --> 16:08.610
Garden Depot crew, what's up?

16:08.693 --> 16:12.406
Hey, Dev.
Um, Marie was just wrapping up.

16:12.490 --> 16:15.075
Tell us stuff about your day
today, please.

16:15.159 --> 16:16.076
Please tell some stuff.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.536
Uh, okay.

16:17.619 --> 16:20.289
Well, um, earlier today,
my friend Denise and I

16:20.372 --> 16:21.790
were on the subway, right?

16:21.873 --> 16:23.375
And we saw this dude jerking off.

16:23.459 --> 16:25.710
So we made a citizen's arrest,

16:25.794 --> 16:27.129
and the police came and got him.

16:27.212 --> 16:28.297
Damn!

16:28.380 --> 16:29.923
Good for you, man, wow.

16:30.007 --> 16:32.759
You are a masturbation vigilante.

16:32.843 --> 16:34.052
Well, I don't know about that.

16:34.136 --> 16:35.971
That makes it sound like
I was the one masturbating.

16:36.054 --> 16:37.264
Oh, does it?

16:37.348 --> 16:38.432
Yeah, like, I'm a vigilante that, like,

16:38.516 --> 16:40.184
jerks off on villains.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.311
Like, I see a bank robber,
and I'm, like, "Stop it!"

16:42.394 --> 16:44.104
That would be really cool too.

16:44.188 --> 16:45.356
"Don't mug that lady!"

16:45.439 --> 16:46.648
Here, have a drink.

16:46.731 --> 16:49.067
Yeah, to masturbation vigilante.

16:49.151 --> 16:50.528
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.364
The other day at CVS, this guy tells me,

16:53.447 --> 16:56.158
"Smile more, beautiful."

16:56.241 --> 16:57.617
I'm like, "Fuck off!"

16:57.701 --> 16:59.578
Why should you smile more? Why?

16:59.661 --> 17:03.332
'Cause women get paid 23 cents
less on the dollar than men do?

17:03.415 --> 17:05.501
Uh, because the government's
trying to regulate your body?

17:05.584 --> 17:08.795
You smile more, uh-uh. Him smile less.

17:08.879 --> 17:11.382
And then I sent a cop
a photo of the guy's dick.

17:11.465 --> 17:12.841
That is awesome.

17:12.924 --> 17:14.009
Let's all do shots.

17:14.092 --> 17:16.387
Yeah!

17:22.476 --> 17:29.441
♪ ♪

17:43.622 --> 17:45.082
It's all around us, man.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.876
I mean, look at this Garden Depot spot.

17:47.959 --> 17:49.545
When they hire the background actresses,

17:49.628 --> 17:52.130
they got to get the hottest women ever.

17:52.214 --> 17:54.007
They don't have to do that with the guys.

17:54.091 --> 17:56.176
It's never like,
"Oh, are these men handsome enough?

17:56.260 --> 17:57.636
Uh, do they all have six-packs?"

17:57.719 --> 17:58.678
Never.

17:58.762 --> 18:00.472
They're, like, all frumpy bags of pudding.

18:00.556 --> 18:01.515
No offense.

18:01.599 --> 18:03.225
Yeah.

18:03.308 --> 18:05.227
The whole spot, you know,
it's these three guys

18:05.310 --> 18:07.187
are having a barbecue,
and one of their wives

18:07.271 --> 18:08.522
comes up with lemonade.

18:08.606 --> 18:10.566
Isn't that whole thing just antiquated?

18:10.649 --> 18:12.359
Yeah. All right.

18:12.443 --> 18:13.860
I got to hit the hay, brother.

18:13.944 --> 18:15.446
It's great chatting with you. All right.

18:15.529 --> 18:16.738
See you, Brad!

18:21.743 --> 18:23.120
Uh, hey, man.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.246
What's going on? Is my trailer moving?

18:24.329 --> 18:25.289
I'm playing Ted.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.124
Oh, man, I got some bad news.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.667
They did a big rewrite this morning.

18:28.750 --> 18:30.335
Your part got nixed.

18:30.419 --> 18:33.171
Now it's three ladies having a barbecue.

18:33.255 --> 18:34.131
What?

18:36.091 --> 18:38.343
Hey, man, you changed the whole spot?

18:38.427 --> 18:40.095
Oh, yeah.

18:40.178 --> 18:41.888
I'm so sorry, man.

18:41.972 --> 18:43.641
I thought about what
you were saying last night,

18:43.723 --> 18:45.559
and I talked about it with the ad agency.

18:45.643 --> 18:48.812
And... we just decided
to go in this new direction.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.105
Well, is there another direction

18:50.188 --> 18:52.399
where I don't get fired
and lose a bunch of money?

18:52.483 --> 18:55.819
Oh, man, I wish I didn't
have to let you go, brother.

18:55.902 --> 19:00.240
I did get you this vintage sheriff's badge

19:00.324 --> 19:03.327
as a sort of thank-you/I'm sorry gift.

19:03.410 --> 19:06.037
You'll always be the sheriff on my set.

19:06.121 --> 19:07.956
Well, I appreciate the sheriff's badge,

19:08.039 --> 19:10.834
but is there anything I can do
in the commercial still?

19:10.917 --> 19:12.877
I think I have an idea.

19:12.961 --> 19:16.423
Oh, man, the sun is out,
and that means barbecues.

19:16.507 --> 19:18.634
At Garden Depot, they have the best deals

19:18.717 --> 19:20.051
on the biggest grills.

19:20.135 --> 19:22.513
It's summertime! Let's get cooking.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.806
Save up to 40% on our top grill brands

19:24.889 --> 19:26.099
all summer long.

19:26.183 --> 19:28.519
Get them while they're hot.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.479
And rakes too!

19:30.562 --> 19:32.481
Oh, God, do we have smaller rakes?

19:32.564 --> 19:34.899
Because it looks like
we're selling giant rakes.

19:34.983 --> 19:36.985
Let-- Let's do another take, Dev.

19:37.068 --> 19:38.236
Sure.

19:39.863 --> 19:41.990
And action!

19:43.200 --> 19:44.784
And rakes too.

19:44.868 --> 19:47.412
Okay, I think we got it.

19:47.496 --> 19:48.830
Good job, man.

19:48.913 --> 19:49.998
Thanks.

19:51.709 --> 19:52.710
Anush?

19:52.792 --> 19:54.503
Hey, man, how's it going?

19:54.586 --> 19:56.046
Good, what're you doing here?

19:56.129 --> 19:57.297
I just booked a part in this commercial.

19:57.381 --> 19:58.340
I'm the rake guy!

19:59.717 --> 20:01.593
What? What's wrong?

20:01.677 --> 20:02.886
Hey, where you going?

20:02.969 --> 20:04.596
Hey, are you in this commercial too?

20:06.724 --> 20:08.850
And rakes too.

20:08.933 --> 20:11.061
Goddamn, he's good.

20:11.144 --> 20:12.771
I know, right?

20:16.400 --> 20:17.401
Hey, Dev.

20:17.484 --> 20:18.694
Hey, what's up, Diana?

20:18.777 --> 20:20.195
Um, we just all felt really bad

20:20.278 --> 20:21.821
about what happened to you.

20:21.905 --> 20:23.948
I mean, we loved having
more to do in the commercial,

20:24.032 --> 20:26.284
but it sucks that you couldn't
be in it at all.

20:26.368 --> 20:30.539
So we got you this.

20:30.622 --> 20:31.749
Whoa.

20:31.790 --> 20:34.834
A guy jerking off on the subway,
on a cake.

20:34.918 --> 20:37.003
Shout-out to the pastry team
at the grocery store

20:37.087 --> 20:38.630
for doing that design for you.

20:38.714 --> 20:40.924
Yeah, it was definitely uncomfortable.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.009
I'm not really sure what
they think this cake is for.

20:43.093 --> 20:45.136
But anyway,
thanks for saying what you said to Brad

20:45.220 --> 20:46.722
about the commercial.

20:46.805 --> 20:48.014
It's just really nice
that you tried to see it

20:48.098 --> 20:49.641
from our perspective.

20:49.725 --> 20:52.644
Also, the cake is 100% gluten-free.

20:52.728 --> 20:54.521
Do you know what gluten does to you?

20:54.605 --> 20:56.440
Lupus. Gluten gives you lupus.

20:56.523 --> 20:57.775
Okay, Marie.

20:59.067 --> 21:00.193
So you got fired.

21:00.277 --> 21:01.945
At least you still got
to attend the wrap party.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.572
Yes, great consolation.

21:03.655 --> 21:06.366
Cash bar and bad nachos.

21:06.450 --> 21:08.368
I'm never buying one of those grills.

21:08.452 --> 21:10.412
Actually,
I'm gonna buy a bunch of those grills,

21:10.495 --> 21:11.955
deplete their stock,

21:12.038 --> 21:13.415
then return them at the end of the summer.

21:13.498 --> 21:14.499
Boom!

21:14.583 --> 21:15.793
Thanks, buddy.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.628
Might be a little unnecessary, though.

21:17.711 --> 21:19.921
To me not getting fired at my next gig!

21:21.840 --> 21:24.760
Hey, man,
I'm so sorry that things didn't work out,

21:24.843 --> 21:27.471
but your idea came out really great.

21:27.554 --> 21:28.555
Aw, thanks, man.

21:28.639 --> 21:29.556
Yeah.

21:29.640 --> 21:30.890
Hey, hey.

21:30.974 --> 21:33.184
Brad Honeycutt, Brad Honeycutt, okay.

21:33.268 --> 21:34.853
Yeah. I'm really sorry again.

21:34.936 --> 21:37.397
Hey, Brad Honeycutt, okay.

21:37.481 --> 21:39.190
So there's a thing.

21:39.274 --> 21:40.275
What?

21:40.358 --> 21:41.860
You didn't notice that?

21:41.943 --> 21:43.654
That guy only introduced
himself to the men at the table.

21:43.737 --> 21:46.281
He went right past us, like
Denise and I were invisible.

21:46.364 --> 21:48.116
Yeah, he totally snubbed us.

21:48.199 --> 21:49.493
I don't know,
I don't think that was intentional.

21:49.576 --> 21:50.702
You guys were sitting in the corner.

21:50.786 --> 21:51.953
He was probably just in a rush.

21:52.036 --> 21:53.747
Yeah, well, in his rush,
he managed to shake hands

21:53.831 --> 21:55.332
with two random dudes and Arnold.

21:55.415 --> 21:56.708
He didn't think we were important enough.

21:56.792 --> 21:57.835
I don't know.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.128
Seems like you might be
reading a bit much into it.

22:00.211 --> 22:01.630
We're telling you that this is something

22:01.713 --> 22:03.340
that definitely happens to women
all the time.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.049
But fine,
deny our perception of the world.

22:05.133 --> 22:06.635
Here's my issue.

22:06.718 --> 22:09.095
He just went to the bathroom,
washed his hands, they're still wet.

22:09.179 --> 22:10.639
I don't want to shake no wet hands.

22:10.722 --> 22:13.851
Now I got to wash my hands. BRB.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.435
Man, I hate this shit.

22:15.519 --> 22:16.936
I'm gonna get a shot of Sprite.

22:20.023 --> 22:21.441
Are you really mad at me right now?

22:21.525 --> 22:22.860
Kind of.

22:22.942 --> 22:24.110
Not that mad, though, right?

22:24.194 --> 22:25.278
Hey!

22:25.362 --> 22:26.738
What? Why are you mad at me?

22:26.822 --> 22:28.657
Your beef's with Brad Honeycutt.

22:28.740 --> 22:31.702
Do you really think that guy
has something against women

22:31.785 --> 22:33.829
'cause he didn't shake
you and Denise's hands?

22:33.912 --> 22:36.122
You're not listening to what
I'm trying to say at all.

22:36.206 --> 22:37.833
All right, whatever.

22:37.916 --> 22:39.918
I'm sorry you missed out
on the life-changing experience

22:40.001 --> 22:41.586
of shaking hands with Brad Honeycutt.

22:41.670 --> 22:42.921
What a tragedy.

22:43.004 --> 22:44.964
I'm gonna go get a drink.

22:45.048 --> 22:46.842
Rachel!

22:58.729 --> 23:00.939
So I was thinking about the whole

23:01.022 --> 23:02.691
Brad Honeycutt situation.

23:02.774 --> 23:06.403
And, um, there's a chance that what he did

23:06.486 --> 23:08.279
may have been a little sexist.

23:08.363 --> 23:10.824
Great, cool apology.

23:10.908 --> 23:12.826
Look, I'm just saying I'm sorry

23:12.910 --> 23:14.411
I defended Brad Honeycutt.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.995
Can you at least give me that I'm not some

23:16.079 --> 23:17.956
sort of sexist monster for thinking that

23:18.039 --> 23:22.085
maybe he wasn't motivated
by a crazy sexist agenda

23:22.168 --> 23:24.254
when he didn't introduce
himself to you guys?

23:24.337 --> 23:26.965
I'm not saying
that you're a sexist monster.

23:27.048 --> 23:29.259
I just think it's weird
that your first instinct

23:29.342 --> 23:32.220
is to act like I'm crazy
and defend Brad Honeycutt

23:32.303 --> 23:34.639
instead of just believing me.

23:34.723 --> 23:36.349
Well, I guess,
in my head, I'd like to think

23:36.433 --> 23:38.309
someone isn't so awful that they wouldn't

23:38.393 --> 23:40.938
introduce themselves to someone
just 'cause they're a woman.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.397
And what I'm saying
is that there are a lot

23:42.480 --> 23:44.315
of subtle little things that happen to me

23:44.399 --> 23:48.194
and all women,
even in our little progressive world.

23:48.278 --> 23:50.822
And when somebody,
especially my boyfriend,

23:50.906 --> 23:53.700
tells me I'm wrong without
having any way of knowing

23:53.784 --> 23:56.494
my personal experience, it's insulting.

23:58.121 --> 23:59.998
Okay. I get that.

24:00.123 --> 24:01.917
Well, I mean, I guess there's no way

24:02.000 --> 24:03.042
I'll ever really know what it's like

24:03.126 --> 24:05.295
to be in your shoes, so...

24:05.378 --> 24:08.548
I'll try to do a better job of listening,
all right?

24:09.591 --> 24:11.760
So can we call it a draw?

24:11.843 --> 24:13.470
Nope. I won.

24:13.553 --> 24:15.722
- Hey!
- I won!

24:15.806 --> 24:18.057
Hello, everybody, I won!

24:18.141 --> 24:21.269
I had a fight with my boyfriend,
and I just won that fight!

24:21.352 --> 24:23.229
No, we came to an understanding

24:23.313 --> 24:24.815
after a thoughtful discussion.

24:24.898 --> 24:25.816
I won!
