00:01.736 --> 00:05.004
Max, did you pick up
the tip from table two?

00:05.006 --> 00:09.708
No, but I'm pretty sure
I picked up a staph infection.

00:09.710 --> 00:13.579
So they literally gave me
their two cents worth.

00:13.581 --> 00:14.847
This is so embarrassing,

00:14.849 --> 00:18.851
even Abe Lincoln
won't make eye contact.

00:18.853 --> 00:21.587
Girls, I need you
to do something for me.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.455
You know the rule:
nothing for you,

00:23.457 --> 00:27.126
on you, near you,
or in us.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.762
I'm going to restroom.
Keep eye on the kitchen.

00:29.764 --> 00:32.364
I have a four-minute egg
and a five-minute date

00:32.366 --> 00:35.968
with the<i> Sports Illustrated</i>
<i>Swimsuit Issue.</i>

00:38.739 --> 00:40.606
Hey, do you see
what I see?

00:40.608 --> 00:41.640
A fire?

00:41.642 --> 00:44.643
No, a way out
of this job.

00:45.679 --> 00:49.148
Lord Jesus,
there's a fire.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.450
You two gonna do
anything about that?

00:51.452 --> 00:53.018
'Cause I'm not.

00:53.020 --> 00:57.089
I don't mess with fire
or Presbyterians.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.390
Fire, fire!

00:58.392 --> 00:59.858
I smell fire!

00:59.860 --> 01:01.960
Well, don't just stand there.
Do something!

01:01.962 --> 01:05.831
We are.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.866
S'mores!

01:07.868 --> 01:11.236
You'd think you want this place
to burn to the ground.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.605
You'd think that.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.207
Caroline,
do something.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.943
I'm on it.
Chocolate?

01:22.583 --> 01:24.083
(Caroline)
Han, not too close.

01:24.085 --> 01:26.385
You know you can never
get the smell of Korean barbecue

01:26.387 --> 01:28.153
out of your clothes.

01:29.857 --> 01:32.858
[shouting]

01:34.962 --> 01:36.595
[shouts weakly]

01:38.532 --> 01:39.898
Either
he put the fire out,

01:39.900 --> 01:42.634
or that little robot
just had an orgasm.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.418
Welcome to The High
dessert bar.

01:59.420 --> 02:02.354
I'm the hostess
slash quasi-manager.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.957
First day in,
got a huge promosh.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.158
I hate to brag,

02:06.160 --> 02:08.193
but the word "dazzling"
was used.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.798
Yeah, by you.

02:12.800 --> 02:16.268
Little to no power
has really gone to your head.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.436
It has.

02:17.438 --> 02:21.140
She's like
the Putin of pastry.

02:21.142 --> 02:22.474
But doesn't it
feel good

02:22.476 --> 02:24.576
to not just be working
at the diner?

02:24.578 --> 02:28.213
I haven't slipped
on one used baby diaper all day.

02:28.215 --> 02:31.016
Speaking of babies,

02:31.018 --> 02:33.051
look,
there's Han.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.259
That's, like,
the third time

02:40.261 --> 02:42.127
I caught him
spying on us.

02:42.129 --> 02:45.531
Why would he stalk
two of his worst employees?

02:45.533 --> 02:46.431
I know.

02:46.433 --> 02:47.933
It's like<i> Where's Waldo?</i>

02:47.935 --> 02:51.036
when you don't want
to find Waldo.

02:51.038 --> 02:54.106
Not seeing a hostess
up in here.

02:54.108 --> 02:56.308
She meant
quasi-manager.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.177
If Marty Scorsese
walks in here,

02:58.179 --> 02:59.711
do you want him
to seat himself?

02:59.713 --> 03:02.481
He'll be lost.
Lost.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.816
Sorry, Joe, I was just
over there giving Max--

03:04.818 --> 03:06.818
Honey, I'll download
an audiobook

03:06.820 --> 03:09.821
if I want
to hear a story.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.390
I want you
to meet someone.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.859
Me too, and I'm sure
I will when the time is right

03:13.861 --> 03:16.428
and I'm open to it.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.430
Kind of focusing on me
right now.

03:18.432 --> 03:20.299
Stop.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.801
Learn to read faces.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.203
I'm not talking
about you.

03:24.205 --> 03:26.438
I'm talking
about him.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.807
[with Irish accent]
Hello, pleasure
to meet you.

03:28.809 --> 03:29.908
I'm Nashit.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.476
Nashit's
an Indian name,

03:31.478 --> 03:33.645
and isn't that
an Irish accent I detect?

03:33.647 --> 03:35.247
Or have I just
lost consciousness

03:35.249 --> 03:37.583
from how white
your teeth are?

03:37.585 --> 03:38.684
Yes, it is.

03:38.686 --> 03:41.086
My father's Indian.
My mother's Irish.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.387
He's Irish.
He's Indian.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.922
He's East
meets West.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.257
He's everything

03:45.259 --> 03:49.127
in a hot Irish coffee,
boy band package.

03:49.129 --> 03:51.063
I found him
on the street

03:51.065 --> 03:53.799
next to a dirty chair.

03:53.801 --> 03:57.169
Hi, I'm Caroline, the hostess
slash quasi-manager

03:57.171 --> 03:58.203
at The High.

03:58.205 --> 04:00.239
Are you high?

04:00.241 --> 04:02.541
'Cause that was
a lot of talking.

04:02.543 --> 04:05.277
Who is this,
and where can I get one?

04:05.279 --> 04:07.579
This is Nashit,
our new waiter.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.081
Oh, it's lovely
to meet you.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.315
[gasps]

04:10.317 --> 04:14.152
Can you say
"magically delicious"?

04:14.154 --> 04:16.555
I really want Nashit
to work out.

04:16.557 --> 04:19.691
I like it when
good-looking people succeed.

04:19.693 --> 04:22.494
Well, I guess
that's good news for me.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.329
Is it?

04:26.967 --> 04:28.500
Hi, honey.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.135
(Joe)
Have you met
the new waiter?

04:30.137 --> 04:33.272
I love him.
He's my favorite.

04:33.274 --> 04:37.142
If I did men,
he would've been done by now.

04:38.679 --> 04:41.813
Hmm, so you think
you're pretty.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.682
Well, I do too.

04:45.185 --> 04:46.685
Okay, Nashit,
pay attention.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.954
These are the tables.
This is the dessert bar.

04:48.956 --> 04:52.991
And these are
my boobs.

04:52.993 --> 04:55.460
Max, be professional.

04:55.462 --> 04:58.130
These are
my boobs, sir.

04:58.132 --> 05:00.365
Please, I have
to make him a waiter.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.467
Fine, you make him
a waiter,

05:02.469 --> 05:04.836
and I'll just
make him later.

05:10.210 --> 05:13.712
Here you go.
This isn't yours, is it?

05:13.714 --> 05:16.648
No, because
they already have dessert.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.684
Damn it.

05:18.686 --> 05:21.119
You asked for water,
like, an hour ago, didn't you?

05:21.121 --> 05:22.454
I'm so sorry.

05:22.456 --> 05:25.157
Oh, don't you worry
those lips.

05:25.159 --> 05:29.961
And what's an hour when we have
our whole lives ahead of us?

05:29.963 --> 05:32.230
Max, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

05:32.232 --> 05:33.732
I stink
as a waiter.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.434
This is desperate.

05:35.436 --> 05:38.904
Well, desperate times
call for us making out.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.341
Hey, I have
a question for you.

05:42.343 --> 05:44.443
Your skin is
so creamy and white.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.178
You must have
a little Irish in you.

05:46.180 --> 05:50.282
I've had a lot
of little Irishes in me.

05:50.284 --> 05:52.150
That's meant
to be dirty, right?

05:52.152 --> 05:55.721
Well, I just mean that I think
you're quite beautiful.

05:55.723 --> 06:00.192
Oh, well, then I just mean
we're doing it.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.626
I did not think
there was somebody

06:01.628 --> 06:04.062
who had a prettier nose
or was worse than me

06:04.064 --> 06:06.031
waiting tables,
but here we are.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.967
Nashit, there's not a fork
in the mix out there.

06:08.969 --> 06:12.304
Now, get out there
and fork those women.

06:12.306 --> 06:13.438
Take it easy on him.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.973
I don't him to be
all forked out

06:14.975 --> 06:17.008
by the time
he gets to me.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.745
I'm gonna have so much sex
on my bed with Nashit

06:19.747 --> 06:22.080
that I'm gonna need
a new sheet.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.949
Aren't you
too old for him?

06:23.951 --> 06:27.953
Yeah, but that test
said mentally I'm 14,

06:27.955 --> 06:30.389
so we can
totally do it.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.391
Well, I'm off to Chinatown
to have someone

06:32.393 --> 06:34.292
put needles in me.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.328
Oh, my God.
I love your coat.

06:36.330 --> 06:37.529
You look gorgeous.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.631
I mean,
the way it flows.

06:39.633 --> 06:43.034
Okay, so I can see
you're a kiss-ass,

06:43.036 --> 06:44.069
so here's the thing.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.637
As my quasi-manager,

06:45.639 --> 06:48.607
or whatever nonsense
you're telling people,

06:48.609 --> 06:51.743
I need you to tell
Max and Nashit to cool it.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.879
There are no hookups
here at The High.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.947
Done, and we can stop
staying "quasi"

06:55.949 --> 06:57.916
if we're both on board
with the manager thing.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.252
We're not.

07:00.254 --> 07:01.787
The High is
about fine pastry,

07:01.789 --> 07:03.855
not someone's
sordid love life.

07:03.857 --> 07:06.291
And in an ironic twist,
I need you to kick

07:06.293 --> 07:08.126
my girlfriend's
hot ass out of here

07:08.128 --> 07:10.395
if she comes in.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.997
Here's $100.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.165
That's $100.

07:13.167 --> 07:15.867
Consider her hot ass
out the door.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.436
We're in a fight.

07:17.438 --> 07:19.304
She got drunk,
stole my Black Card,

07:19.306 --> 07:22.274
and bought 90 people soup
at Barney Greengrass,

07:22.276 --> 07:25.243
and the soup isn't
even good there.

07:25.245 --> 07:28.680
Do not take this as a no,
because I want the money,

07:28.682 --> 07:30.582
but why can't you
just tell her yourself?

07:30.584 --> 07:31.883
I can't
tell her myself.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.219
She's younger than me,
and everyone knows

07:34.221 --> 07:36.822
the mommy thing
just isn't sexy.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.727
Make sure she eats something
and gets home safe.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.431
Caroline, I have
a question for you.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.500
What do I do with the notes
the women give me?

07:48.502 --> 07:50.202
You've gotten notes?

07:50.204 --> 07:51.203
Just a few.

07:51.205 --> 07:53.438
[gasps]

07:53.440 --> 07:56.341
How could women
be this desperate?

07:56.343 --> 07:58.543
Max, this one's
from you.

07:58.545 --> 08:00.946
They're mostly
all from me,

08:00.948 --> 08:02.414
except the business card.

08:02.416 --> 08:03.682
I don't need
no damn card

08:03.684 --> 08:05.884
to let him know
I'm all business.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.787
Max, Joe just told me there are
no hookups at The High,

08:08.789 --> 08:11.790
and judging from this
very detailed picture you drew,

08:11.792 --> 08:13.458
that's exactly
what you're planning.

08:13.460 --> 08:16.461
Oh, I was planning more.
I just ran out of paper.

08:16.463 --> 08:17.896
We can't lose
these jobs.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.765
I have two $100 bills,
and I'm this close

08:20.767 --> 08:23.268
to pulling the trigger
on an Amazon Prime account.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.636
Amazon Prime?

08:24.638 --> 08:26.805
You have been driven mad
with power.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.278
Fresh, flakey pastry.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.613
And speaking of flakes,

08:34.615 --> 08:37.315
there's Joe's
flakey girlfriend.

08:37.317 --> 08:41.219
Can someone help me
get my chair off my coat?

08:41.221 --> 08:42.721
How did she
get in here?

08:42.723 --> 08:45.891
Probably floated in
on a cloud of Valium.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.994
It's go time,
as in she's got to go.

08:48.996 --> 08:51.630
You have a better chance
moving an actual train wreck,

08:51.632 --> 08:53.265
but good luck.

08:53.267 --> 08:56.735
- Allie, hi, you--
- Shh.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.771
[whispering]
Allie, hi.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.773
- You need--
- Sorry.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.875
But I am hungover,
and I have a headache.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.645
Could I get a latte
with a side of weed?

09:06.647 --> 09:08.613
No, because
this isn't Amsterdam

09:08.615 --> 09:10.715
or Bill Maher's house.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.083
Now, you need
to leave.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.652
You know Joe
doesn't want you in here.

09:13.654 --> 09:14.686
Well, I'm
not leaving.

09:14.688 --> 09:15.987
My legs won't move

09:15.989 --> 09:18.523
because my muscle relaxers
just kicked in.

09:18.525 --> 09:20.559
John, can you
do me a favor?

09:20.561 --> 09:21.860
Walk Allie outside,

09:21.862 --> 09:23.562
and by that,
I mean pick her up

09:23.564 --> 09:25.230
and carry her outside.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.232
I went
to pastry school.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.936
I'm not Shrek.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.705
Of course not.
You're much more Fiona.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.206
Girl, that's good.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.842
I was gonna say the donkey,
'cause I have a fine ass.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.648
(Allie)
Okay, fine.

09:43.650 --> 09:47.919
Driver, two stops.
Barney's and fro-yo.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.694
(Max)
Earl, we're late again.
Did you keep us alive?

09:55.696 --> 09:59.297
Max, I can barely
keep myself alive.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.733
This morning,
I had to jump-start my heart

10:01.735 --> 10:03.668
by putting my finger
in the socket

10:03.670 --> 10:05.737
<i>Tom and Jerry</i> style.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.807
Oh, hello.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.742
So what did
you girls do today?

10:10.744 --> 10:14.379
I haven't seen you
since right here last night.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.880
Oh, really, Han?

10:15.882 --> 10:18.283
'Cause I swear
I saw you lurking around

10:18.285 --> 10:19.517
outside The High.

10:19.519 --> 10:20.719
It was either you,

10:20.721 --> 10:24.823
or Pikachu
is visiting New York.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.691
That one
barely grazed me,

10:26.693 --> 10:27.726
because I'm Korean,

10:27.728 --> 10:30.061
and Pikachu
is Japanese.

10:30.063 --> 10:33.932
You don't know anything
about Pokemon.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.702
Han, you may not
be Japanese,

10:37.704 --> 10:39.437
but in the future,
you're definitely

10:39.439 --> 10:42.641
gonna be poked
by a mon.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.342
And it was you.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.710
No, it was not.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.012
- Yeah, it was.
- Wasn't.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.213
- Was.
- Wasn't.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.849
- Wasn't.
- Was--wasn't.

10:50.851 --> 10:53.418
English is
my second language.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.886
Admit it,
you're jealous

10:54.888 --> 10:57.322
we're spending time
with another restaurant.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.857
I am not jealous.

10:58.859 --> 10:59.991
- Are so.
- Am not.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.426
- Am not.
- Are so--not.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.028
Oh, my God!

11:05.899 --> 11:07.999
Caroline, what the hell
are you doing?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.968
I'm smelling
a $100 bill.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.670
It's from
my other restaurant.

11:11.672 --> 11:13.471
It buys me
nice things.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.206
Jealous?

11:15.208 --> 11:18.309
I took you in
when you had no one.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.480
Hi, can you
help me?

11:22.482 --> 11:24.182
I'm looking for Max.

11:24.184 --> 11:29.054
Why, hello.
Is it too late to be gay?

11:29.056 --> 11:30.689
Nashit?

11:30.691 --> 11:32.824
Oh, my God,
he even looks good here

11:32.826 --> 11:35.160
in morgue light.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.861
We are
so doing it.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.197
Caroline, you left
your phone on the table

11:39.199 --> 11:40.598
at the restaurant.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.934
I confess,
I used it as an excuse

11:42.936 --> 11:44.469
to come
and see Max.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.838
This isn't mine.
It's Joe's girlfriend's.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.306
I don't have
an iPhone 6.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.275
I have an iPhone sick.

11:52.412 --> 11:57.115
D-O-I-N-G it!

11:58.585 --> 12:00.552
Max, why
is Nashit here?

12:00.554 --> 12:04.656
Because God owes me.

12:04.658 --> 12:07.025
You can't seriously
be into him.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.927
He looks like
someone in a boy band.

12:08.929 --> 12:12.864
Yeah, and he's going
one direction...

12:15.502 --> 12:18.136
Down there.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.971
But if you sleep
with him,

12:19.973 --> 12:22.273
then Nashit
is gonna hit the fan.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.409
How do you know
you even like him?

12:24.411 --> 12:28.346
You know what I like?
That we're doing it.

12:29.649 --> 12:31.282
Hey, everybody!

12:33.120 --> 12:34.486
I just got hit
by a cab,

12:34.488 --> 12:39.691
and, boy, am I in the mood
for crab legs.

12:39.693 --> 12:41.659
The thing
about you, baby--

12:41.661 --> 12:44.629
you bounce back
from a good pounding

12:44.631 --> 12:47.398
every single night.

12:49.836 --> 12:53.872
Wait a minute.

12:53.874 --> 12:57.008
That's my booth.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.144
Oh, it's lovely
to meet you.

13:00.380 --> 13:03.681
What?

13:03.683 --> 13:07.018
What the hell
kind of accent is that?

13:07.020 --> 13:09.187
I'm from Ireland.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.388
What?

13:12.425 --> 13:13.925
Max, you are
not doing it.

13:13.927 --> 13:14.926
- Are.
- Not.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.161
- Are.
- Not.

13:16.163 --> 13:19.164
- Not.
- Please, I went to Wharton.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.633
Look, we should go
to your place when we do it

13:21.635 --> 13:24.502
so that Caroline won't be there
while we're doing it.

13:24.504 --> 13:28.773
Lovely, but I just came
to America two days ago.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.408
I have no place to go.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.877
In fact, I've been sleeping
on that dirty chair

13:32.879 --> 13:36.347
Joe spoke of.

13:36.349 --> 13:40.318
What?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.987
Is he singing?

13:44.524 --> 13:45.790
Oh, my God.

13:45.792 --> 13:48.426
He's gorgeous
and homeless?

13:48.428 --> 13:50.795
That's your
dream guy.

13:50.797 --> 13:53.097
We are so doing it!

13:59.039 --> 14:01.039
Ugh, this is
impossible.

14:01.041 --> 14:05.276
I feel like I'm putting
an Oscar dress on Precious.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.882
I'm making up
the couch for Nashit.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.483
That is so nice of you.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.652
He's gonna need a place
to crash after we have sex.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.321
No, that's
off the table.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.489
I can't believe
you invited him to stay here.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.191
And I can't believe
you refused

14:20.193 --> 14:24.696
to sleep at Starbucks tonight
to give us some privacy.

14:24.698 --> 14:28.433
I mean, you like
Nora Jones.

14:28.435 --> 14:31.436
[whistling]

14:32.639 --> 14:35.173
Max likey.

14:35.175 --> 14:38.476
- Max, listen.
- No, you listen.

14:38.478 --> 14:43.882
I can't afford candy,
so he has got to be it.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.450
Thanks for the shower.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.920
Oh, no, his muscles
point to his penis.

14:52.959 --> 14:55.293
[knock at door]

14:55.295 --> 14:56.995
Max, stop
with the banging.

14:56.997 --> 15:01.966
I'm not letting you out
while you're still in heat.

15:01.968 --> 15:03.268
(Max)
It's not me.

15:03.270 --> 15:06.738
I'm making a list
of ways to kill you!

15:08.508 --> 15:10.875
I feel like
I'm being a bother,

15:10.877 --> 15:14.979
and I think I'm sleeping
on a bong.

15:14.981 --> 15:16.114
[knock at door]

15:16.116 --> 15:17.382
(Joe)
Open up.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.150
I know what's going on
in there.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.318
(Caroline)
Oh, my God.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.920
That's Joe.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.122
She must've found out
about you and Max hooking up.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.290
(Nashit)
Oh, no.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.191
Max, Joe is here.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.459
You need to do
that thing you do

15:28.461 --> 15:29.761
to scare people
out of the hallway.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.229
What do we think,
guard dog

15:31.231 --> 15:32.897
or little old lady
with poor eyesight

15:32.899 --> 15:34.132
and loaded gun?

15:34.134 --> 15:36.901
[Max imitating dog barking]

15:36.903 --> 15:38.169
Fine, I'm going.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.471
This is why
I never leave Manhattan.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.740
Hey, you need to get
in the girls' apartment?

15:42.742 --> 15:44.375
I have a key.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.444
Find it here
in my big bag.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.613
I know it's
in here somewhere.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.249
Well, I got
the lip balm.

15:51.251 --> 15:54.519
I got--Oh, look,
I got the Holy Bible.

15:54.521 --> 15:55.720
I got--

15:56.790 --> 16:00.892
Oh, look.
Oh, the DirecTV remote.

16:00.894 --> 16:03.895
Oh, my God,
I'm losing estrogen.

16:03.897 --> 16:06.164
Max, you and Nashit
go hide in your room,

16:06.166 --> 16:08.499
but no sex.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.834
You heard her,
no sex,

16:09.836 --> 16:11.903
so everything but,
and I mean everything,

16:11.905 --> 16:13.304
and I mean but.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.341
Oh, here it is.
It's right--

16:16.343 --> 16:20.278
It was right under the cold cuts
the whole time.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.115
(Joe)
Caroline.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.984
Hey.
Hi, Joe.

16:25.986 --> 16:30.655
Oh!

16:30.657 --> 16:32.156
Yeah.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.158
Ha!

16:34.160 --> 16:38.896
Yeah, the shorter hair
makes sense now.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.398
(Sophie)
Yeah.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.434
Good for you,
Caroline.

16:43.436 --> 16:46.838
I hope you like
long, boring stories.

16:48.041 --> 16:51.242
Okay, where's Allie?
I know she's here.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.478
I put a spy app
on her phone,

16:53.480 --> 16:57.515
and I'm not proud of it,
but I'm a jealous woman.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.485
Oh, her phone.
I have it.

17:00.487 --> 17:03.087
She left it at The High
when I threw her ass out today

17:03.089 --> 17:04.756
per your instructions.

17:04.758 --> 17:06.290
I don't know
how I thought this thing

17:06.292 --> 17:08.026
was gonna work out
to begin with.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.360
We met at Coachella.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.964
We were both on Molly,
this intensely hot

17:12.966 --> 17:16.868
Filipino girl.

17:16.870 --> 17:19.037
- Shh, shh.
- I'm hearing sexual sounds.

17:19.039 --> 17:24.409
And hints of secret shame
coming from the bedroom.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.811
- Allie is here.
- No, no one's here.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.646
That's just
our white noise machine.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.915
I'm shocked.
You're not even her type.

17:30.917 --> 17:33.651
Your lips are like
two flair-pen marks.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.023
[Nashit laughs]

17:39.025 --> 17:42.660
That's hot.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.296
Please
don't fire Nashit!

17:45.298 --> 17:48.199
The Dr. Seuss hats
were my idea.

17:48.201 --> 17:52.737
We were playing
<i>Hop on Pop.</i>

17:52.739 --> 17:54.906
I was Pop.

17:54.908 --> 17:57.075
I didn't even know
there was a boy in there.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.143
I only saw you.

17:59.145 --> 18:02.814
Okay, since there are
no hookups at The High,

18:02.816 --> 18:06.084
if you don't stop sleeping
with him immediately,

18:06.086 --> 18:07.351
my new manager...

18:07.353 --> 18:08.619
[clicks tongue]

18:08.621 --> 18:10.788
Caroline here
is gonna have to kick

18:10.790 --> 18:12.890
his beautiful butt
to the curb.

18:12.892 --> 18:17.595
But I was
mid-doing-it!

18:17.597 --> 18:21.265
Honey, there's
a real funky smell in here.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.867
I got to get out
of here.

18:22.869 --> 18:26.971
PS, this is where
you live?

18:26.973 --> 18:28.940
Take another $100.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.547
Earl, hi.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.216
What kind of mood
is Max in?

18:38.218 --> 18:39.717
Pretty good.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.453
On the Max scale,
she's below slightly drunk

18:42.455 --> 18:45.890
but above punching
a customer out.

18:45.892 --> 18:46.958
Oh, good.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.426
I was worried
she'd be mad at me

18:48.428 --> 18:50.061
'cause I had to get rid
of her boy toy.

18:50.063 --> 18:52.563
Caroline, I'd put
my hearing aids back in

18:52.565 --> 18:55.099
if I wanted
to hear a story.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.536
Guess what I have
for you in my purse.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.571
The tampon
I asked for last week?

19:00.573 --> 19:02.874
No, and again,
so sorry about that.

19:02.876 --> 19:05.877
Really dropped
that ball.

19:05.879 --> 19:07.278
Gummy worms.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.980
Yes, I took away
your man candy,

19:08.982 --> 19:11.682
but I got you these,
the hot ones that you like

19:11.684 --> 19:14.218
from the good candy store
with the sneeze guards.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.219
[gasps]

19:15.221 --> 19:16.487
Fancy.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.722
And don't worry
about Nashit.

19:17.724 --> 19:20.091
I got him
another job.

19:20.093 --> 19:21.792
Hot worm!

19:21.794 --> 19:25.830
Clean glasses
coming through.

19:25.832 --> 19:26.964
Nice rack.

19:26.966 --> 19:31.202
Now I know why guys
like saying that to me.

19:31.204 --> 19:32.503
There he is!

19:32.505 --> 19:34.405
There's
the new employee.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.774
(Caroline)
Han, I can't believe
you would hire someone

19:36.776 --> 19:38.609
just 'cause Max
asked you to.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.878
This has nothing
to do with Max or you.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.580
The boy here
said something to me

19:42.582 --> 19:44.448
that you two
couldn't understand.

19:44.450 --> 19:45.683
What's that, sir?

19:45.685 --> 19:46.851
That I was
a hard worker?

19:46.853 --> 19:48.686
That's it!
Yes!

19:48.688 --> 19:50.087
Manna from heaven.

19:50.089 --> 19:53.257
I actually have
an employee who works.

19:53.259 --> 19:54.659
Jealous?

19:55.929 --> 19:57.695
Now, this job,
I can do.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.797
You know, growing up,
I had five brothers and sisters,

19:59.799 --> 20:01.666
and since I was
the least attractive,

20:01.668 --> 20:03.768
I had to clean
all the dishes.

20:03.770 --> 20:05.803
Meet you
in the dish room, Nashit.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.305
Max, what
are you doing?

20:07.307 --> 20:09.173
There may not be
hookups at The High,

20:09.175 --> 20:12.510
but there are hookups
here at our lowest low,

20:12.512 --> 20:14.111
and we are doing it.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.750
Caroline likey.
