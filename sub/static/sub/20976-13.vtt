00:07.166 --> 00:09.433
- They're all looking at me.
- They're looking at me.

00:09.433 --> 00:12.300
- "Botched" is back again.
- Oh, I'm excited now!

00:12.300 --> 00:14.533
- And this season,
Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif--

00:14.533 --> 00:16.266
- Wah!

00:16.266 --> 00:17.400
- Will face
the most shocking...

00:17.400 --> 00:19.300
- Damn! This butt is huge!

00:19.300 --> 00:21.033
- I go sideways.
- Oh.

00:21.033 --> 00:24.033
- You had an unnecessary
double mastectomy?

00:24.033 --> 00:26.233
- I literally have no ass.

00:30.033 --> 00:31.166
- Impossible...

00:31.166 --> 00:32.667
- If I had to put a number

00:32.667 --> 00:34.400
on the amount
of silicone I have,

00:34.400 --> 00:35.400
probably gallons!

00:35.400 --> 00:36.533
- I've got a nose

00:36.533 --> 00:38.600
that only a cat could love.

00:38.600 --> 00:41.166
- My wife's breasts
are bigger than my head.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.166
Wow, I can hear the ocean.

00:42.166 --> 00:43.166
- Horrible...

00:43.166 --> 00:44.200
both: oh!

00:44.200 --> 00:45.467
- That is gangrene.

00:45.467 --> 00:46.600
- That doctor had a stroke.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.200
- Oh, my God.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.600
- Seeing your nipple turn black

00:49.600 --> 00:52.333
is the scariest
you will ever see.

00:52.333 --> 00:54.333
- And toughest revision
cases yet.

00:54.333 --> 00:56.300
is that?

00:56.300 --> 00:57.600
- Just when you thought
it couldn't get any stranger.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.467
.
Poked through the skin.

00:59.467 --> 01:01.467
- Not very often you hear
this kind of sound.

01:03.333 --> 01:05.567
- So their patients will
no longer be botched.

01:05.567 --> 01:08.600
- Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif
are my only hope.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.333
- I don't want to look like this
for the rest of my life.

01:10.333 --> 01:15.333
- If you were of the
male-to-male persuasion,

01:15.333 --> 01:17.300
do you think we'd pair up?

01:17.300 --> 01:19.600
'Cause of my flat butt?

01:19.600 --> 01:21.500
- And tonight...

01:21.500 --> 01:24.633
- I actually can feel
the implant.

01:24.633 --> 01:26.633
This breast is going all the way
underneath the arm.

01:26.633 --> 01:29.600
- That's what the inside
of Kim's breast looks like.

01:29.600 --> 01:32.367
This is all calcium material.

01:32.367 --> 01:34.066
- She's got drywall in here,
basically.

01:34.066 --> 01:35.367
- Yeah.
- Ooh.

01:35.367 --> 01:37.100
Her tip is completely
deformed.

01:37.100 --> 01:38.600
- The pain was excruciating.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.600
I remember
I just wanted to die.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.367
- Whoa.
- He's an enthusi-ass.

01:42.367 --> 01:45.233
- He's enthusiastically
into plastic surgery.

01:45.233 --> 01:46.633
- Is that piercing
in his cheeks?

01:46.633 --> 01:48.233
- Oh, wow.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.233
- Yes.

01:50.600 --> 01:51.633
- You're fascinated
with his taint.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.600
It just "taint" right.

- My name is Joey Prixx.

02:08.266 --> 02:11.200
I have the butt
that's been seen by the world.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.266
My butt went viral.

02:15.533 --> 02:20.633
I had a UK journalist find me
on social media,

02:20.633 --> 02:22.200
and wrote an article.

02:22.200 --> 02:23.633
From that one article,

02:23.633 --> 02:26.233
there were YouTube videos made.

02:26.233 --> 02:30.133
At this point,
I've spent about $60,000.

02:30.133 --> 02:31.667
And I couldn't be happier.

02:31.667 --> 02:37.400
I have 350 cc solid silicone
butt implants.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.133
It was, by far,
the most painful thing

02:39.133 --> 02:40.767
I've ever done to myself,

02:40.767 --> 02:42.533
I couldn't sit for six weeks,

02:42.533 --> 02:45.667
but it was worth it.

02:45.667 --> 02:48.667
Growing up, me and my mom
always used to watch

02:48.667 --> 02:51.700
plastic surgery shows,
and that had a huge impact

02:51.700 --> 02:54.433
on who I've become to this day.

02:54.433 --> 02:57.300
Being able to see people,
like, tweak themselves

02:57.300 --> 02:59.300
and be so much happier after--
I loved it.

02:59.300 --> 03:02.300
So I first started
modifying myself

03:02.300 --> 03:05.400
when I was 15 years old,

03:05.400 --> 03:08.700
and I started going tanning,
I would wear colored contacts.

03:08.700 --> 03:10.300
I get Botox.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.166
I get lip fillers.

03:12.166 --> 03:15.166
I literally
pierced everything.

03:15.166 --> 03:16.667
Except for my earlobes,
I skipped that

03:16.667 --> 03:18.667
because that's boring.

03:18.667 --> 03:21.567
I've had the sweat glands
from my underarms removed.

03:21.567 --> 03:23.700
I haven't sweat since
the procedure.

03:23.700 --> 03:25.734
I wouldn't say I'm obsessed
with plastic surgery,

03:25.734 --> 03:29.533
I would say that I'm
a plastic surgery enthusiast.

03:29.533 --> 03:33.333
I got my first nose job
when I was 21 years old.

03:33.333 --> 03:35.433
The doctor put an implant
over my nose.

03:35.433 --> 03:36.700
It was a nightmare.

03:36.700 --> 03:39.433
After six months,
it slipped down

03:39.433 --> 03:41.333
and broke through my septum.

03:41.333 --> 03:43.300
I realized that
the implant had slipped

03:43.300 --> 03:44.700
because I was using Q-tips

03:44.700 --> 03:47.200
to kind of clean
inside my nose,

03:47.200 --> 03:48.600
and I felt something
really hard.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.200
So I went to the surgeon

03:50.200 --> 03:53.734
and he tried using a clamp

03:53.734 --> 03:57.033
and scalpel to try to trim it,
and then just kind of, like,

03:57.033 --> 03:59.200
push it back into my nose,

03:59.200 --> 04:00.333
and then hope
it was gonna close over.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.700
It didn't.

04:01.700 --> 04:05.300
So I went in for surgery

04:05.300 --> 04:07.233
to have the implant removed.

04:07.233 --> 04:09.333
When I woke up
from that surgery,

04:09.333 --> 04:11.367
my nose was really
bumpy at the top.

04:11.367 --> 04:14.367
My nose is like a canvas

04:14.367 --> 04:15.467
that's half painted.

04:15.467 --> 04:16.767
It's almost there,

04:16.767 --> 04:18.333
it just needs
a little tweak,

04:18.333 --> 04:20.233
and just a little finishing.

04:20.233 --> 04:21.734
I want this all flattened out,

04:21.734 --> 04:23.734
because where the implant was,

04:23.734 --> 04:26.333
it was kind of
just masking the bump

04:26.333 --> 04:29.600
that wasn't done
the first time around.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.734
I'm pretty much just on a quest

04:31.734 --> 04:35.333
of reaching my own kind of
plastic perfection.

04:35.333 --> 04:36.767
♪ ♪

04:36.767 --> 04:38.734
- My name is Kim D.

04:38.734 --> 04:40.734
I'm on "The Real Housewives
of New Jersey."

04:40.734 --> 04:43.367
Last year,
I won best supporting agitator.

04:43.367 --> 04:46.767
I play with the big boys.
Don't  with me.

04:46.767 --> 04:49.266
But let me tell you something,
the only agitators

04:49.266 --> 04:51.367
in my life are these breasts.

04:51.367 --> 04:53.667
I have rippling on one side
in my left breast,

04:53.667 --> 04:56.100
and my right breast goes
all the way to the right,

04:56.100 --> 04:58.233
almost underneath my arm.

04:58.233 --> 05:01.734
It's hardened, and I have
a major space in-between.

05:01.734 --> 05:03.633
I was born
in Paterson, New Jersey.

05:03.633 --> 05:05.500
My childhood was phenomenal.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.533
I was always in beautiful,
frilly dresses.

05:07.533 --> 05:10.400
I loved clothing, and that's why
I got into fashion.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.500
I never really had boobs,
but you know,

05:12.500 --> 05:14.367
I always really kind of
wanted them.

05:14.367 --> 05:17.400
I got married, I had my son,
and right after that,

05:17.400 --> 05:19.000
the marriage
wasn't working out,

05:19.000 --> 05:20.533
and I was going through
a divorce,

05:20.533 --> 05:22.400
and I used some of
my divorce money

05:22.400 --> 05:23.667
to buy my first set of boobs.

05:23.667 --> 05:25.367
That was the real tragedy.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.367
They were done completely wrong.

05:27.367 --> 05:29.333
And my right breast deflated,

05:29.333 --> 05:31.300
so I went back
to the same doctor,

05:31.300 --> 05:33.567
and he decided to just
put one new one in.

05:33.567 --> 05:36.133
And when he put it in,
he put it in wrong.

05:36.133 --> 05:38.433
So that's what led me
to the third surgery,

05:38.433 --> 05:40.567
that they took both implants
out,

05:40.567 --> 05:42.033
and then they re-did
the surgery.

05:42.033 --> 05:43.567
It seemed to be okay.

05:43.567 --> 05:45.533
But as the years went on,

05:45.533 --> 05:47.433
it started contracting again.

05:47.433 --> 05:50.300
So around five years ago,
it looked so bad

05:50.300 --> 05:52.400
that I was seriously considering
surgery again.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.433
And then I had a tragedy.

05:54.433 --> 05:57.433
My boyfriend of 13 years
passed away.

05:57.433 --> 06:00.033
So at that point,
my life was so chaotic,

06:00.033 --> 06:02.700
between losing him,
doing the "Housewives" show,

06:02.700 --> 06:05.300
the last thing I was gonna do
was run and get surgery.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.400
You don't think about that.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.700
- Hi.

06:08.700 --> 06:10.567
- Are you gonna get
your glow on?

06:10.567 --> 06:12.033
- Thanks for coming.
- You're welcome. Of course.

06:12.033 --> 06:13.567
- Thank you. I'm so excited.

06:13.567 --> 06:15.467
- Awesome. Well--
- And I have--

06:15.467 --> 06:17.467
I have so many events
that are coming up,

06:17.467 --> 06:20.433
and have some problem areas
that maybe we can go over

06:20.433 --> 06:22.400
once we start,
you know, spraying.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.600
- Kim has some visual defects
with her breasts,

06:25.600 --> 06:27.600
and she definitely uses
spray tan

06:27.600 --> 06:29.700
to sort of hide those
imperfections.

06:29.700 --> 06:32.467
- This breast is going
all the way underneath the arm.

06:32.467 --> 06:34.333
So if you can try to give me
some cleavage,

06:34.333 --> 06:35.333
that would be wonderful.

06:35.333 --> 06:36.567
Try to make it look like

06:36.567 --> 06:38.734
some kind of symmetry,
you know?

06:38.734 --> 06:40.600
So that's where
my problem area is.

06:41.166 --> 06:42.567
- All right.

06:44.600 --> 06:48.333
This is not normal, and this is
my time to get my body right,

06:48.333 --> 06:51.033
that will get my mind right,
and I can be more successful,

06:51.033 --> 06:53.734
and enjoy the rest of my life.

06:53.734 --> 06:55.367
- The next patient,
we have something

06:55.367 --> 06:57.100
very significant in common.

06:57.100 --> 06:59.367
Not gonna tell you what we have
in common with her, okay?

06:59.367 --> 07:01.100
- Am I gonna be able
to figure it out?

07:01.100 --> 07:04.500
- You may, after talking to her,
you may not, okay?

07:04.500 --> 07:09.467
But she has a very significant
breast problem, okay?

07:09.467 --> 07:11.500
She has had a couple
of breast surgeries

07:11.500 --> 07:12.734
in the past,
let me show you.

07:12.734 --> 07:14.200
She has capsular contracture,

07:14.200 --> 07:15.734
with superior displacement.

07:15.734 --> 07:17.600
A little bit on both sides.
Her name is Kim.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.100
Why don't we bring her in--
- Kim.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.500
- And see whether
you can figure out

07:20.500 --> 07:22.100
what we have in common
with her.

07:22.100 --> 07:25.066
- All right.
Can you please send in Kim?

07:25.066 --> 07:26.600
- Hi.
- Hi, Kim.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.100
- Hi. Paul Nassif.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.633
- Hi. Hi. Nice to meet you.

07:29.633 --> 07:31.633
- I have no clue who this is,
but I'm assuming

07:31.633 --> 07:34.734
what we have in common is that
we're both beautiful people.

07:34.734 --> 07:37.367
- Kim is from New Jersey.
- I know people in New Jersey.

07:37.367 --> 07:40.133
- Kim is famous.

07:40.133 --> 07:41.500
- A little.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.233
- And now you just said Jersey,

07:43.233 --> 07:45.533
celebrity--"Housewives."

07:45.533 --> 07:47.233
- Housewife, right.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.100
My favorite scene
in all the "Housewives"

07:49.100 --> 07:51.767
I've ever seen is when--
you ever had a colonoscopy?

07:51.767 --> 07:53.633
- No, not yet.

07:53.633 --> 07:55.400
- I know what you're gonna say,
though.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.100
Did you crack up?

07:57.100 --> 07:58.500
- Yeah, I did.

07:58.500 --> 07:59.533
- Funniest thing
you've ever seen.

07:59.533 --> 08:01.133
- It was a memorable scene.

08:01.133 --> 08:02.633
- They put him in recovery,

08:02.633 --> 08:04.533
and they just
keep the cameras on him.

08:04.533 --> 08:05.767
And he's just going like this--

08:05.767 --> 08:07.533
- Oh, no!
- He's going, "Oops!"

08:13.767 --> 08:17.033
- They put air in my colon.

08:17.033 --> 08:19.033
- All the air's coming out.

08:19.033 --> 08:22.433
Oh, no. Oh, no!

08:22.433 --> 08:25.667
- Hysterical.
- Wasted!

08:25.667 --> 08:29.433
- All kidding aside, you've had,
Kim, two breast surgeries?

08:29.433 --> 08:31.567
- Two on one side.
Three on another.

08:31.567 --> 08:33.433
- Oh, okay. So tell us.

08:33.433 --> 08:35.033
- All right. It started out,
I got breast implants.

08:35.033 --> 08:36.700
I thought the left breast
was swollen,

08:36.700 --> 08:39.166
and maybe I had an infection,
something was wrong.

08:39.166 --> 08:41.700
When I go back to the same
surgeon, he says, "No,

08:41.700 --> 08:43.400
the right breast deflated."

08:43.400 --> 08:45.433
- So it ruptured.
It ruptured.

08:45.433 --> 08:48.033
- Yeah, so now the same doctor
says, "We don't need to do

08:48.033 --> 08:50.266
"both of them, we're just gonna
put another one in,

08:50.266 --> 08:51.567
this right side."
- Okay.

08:51.567 --> 08:53.533
- And when he did that,

08:53.533 --> 08:57.000
I actually can feel
the corner of the implant.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.533
And I was like,
I'm not going to back

08:58.533 --> 09:00.700
to this same surgeon,
so I looked at a few others.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.567
And I finally found one
who kind of made sense,

09:02.567 --> 09:03.600
and he says, "We're gonna make
the pocket bigger,

09:03.600 --> 09:05.200
"we're gonna irrigate it,

09:05.200 --> 09:06.734
and we're gonna
put bigger implants."

09:06.734 --> 09:08.033
- That's kind of the opposite
of what you wanna do.

09:08.033 --> 09:09.567
- Yeah, right.

09:09.567 --> 09:12.467
If the body didn't like
the implant at one size,

09:12.467 --> 09:16.200
it's gonna like it a lot less
at a larger size.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.433
- Then it was okay
for maybe a year or two.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.734
And again, I start feeling
the same sensation.

09:20.734 --> 09:21.734
I'm done.
- Okay.

09:21.734 --> 09:23.166
- I want to move on,

09:23.166 --> 09:24.166
I want this to be, you know--

09:24.166 --> 09:25.200
I want this behind me.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.533
- Let's go ahead

09:26.533 --> 09:28.033
and go in the exam room,

09:28.033 --> 09:29.600
- Okay.
- And assess how tight

09:29.600 --> 09:32.066
you actually are, okay?
- Okay, okay.

09:32.066 --> 09:35.600
- If Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow
tell me that they don't think

09:35.600 --> 09:38.200
there's anything wrong, and
they can't fix the problem,

09:38.200 --> 09:40.734
I'm going to be devastated.

09:40.734 --> 09:42.233
- So I went to an ENT doctor,

09:42.233 --> 09:44.633
but he went in
with a more senior doctor.

09:44.633 --> 09:47.066
- Well, they were arguing
before she went under

09:47.066 --> 09:49.200
anesthesia about
how to proceed.

09:49.200 --> 09:52.600
- If I was the patient, I'd
cancel that surgery immediately,

09:52.600 --> 09:53.767
and I'd run out that door.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.200
- Bounce it! Bounce it!

09:55.200 --> 09:56.734
- Mine doesn't move!

09:56.734 --> 09:58.100
- What you mean
your butt doesn't move?

09:58.100 --> 09:59.500
- It's rock hard.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.367
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

10:07.367 --> 10:14.033
♪ ♪

10:14.033 --> 10:15.300
- Let's look at
the left one first.

10:15.300 --> 10:18.333
Thin skin,
a little bit of rippling,

10:18.333 --> 10:19.767
and the nipple's
going down.

10:19.767 --> 10:22.667
Treatment for that is to

10:22.667 --> 10:24.266
lower the pocket a little bit,

10:24.266 --> 10:26.400
that'll allow the nipple
to come up,

10:26.400 --> 10:28.266
and put a silicone implant in.

10:28.266 --> 10:29.767
All right, so let's look
at this one.

10:29.767 --> 10:31.734
This one is classic
encapsulation,

10:31.734 --> 10:34.000
which is very significant,
there are four grades.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Grade one means soft,
essentially no encapsulation.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.367
Grade four means super firm,
painful, and displaced.

10:39.367 --> 10:41.200
- That's me.
- You are grade four.

10:41.200 --> 10:45.266
But you're so thin,
despite the encapsulation,

10:45.266 --> 10:47.000
you can feel the implant.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.133
So if we take
the scar tissue out,

10:49.133 --> 10:53.333
you're gonna have paper-thin
tissue, on top of an implant,

10:53.333 --> 10:55.400
and it could be very irregular,
ripply,

10:55.400 --> 10:57.400
and not look
very good either.

10:57.400 --> 11:00.133
So this is a quagmire.

11:00.133 --> 11:02.133
I have to find
the right balance between

11:02.133 --> 11:06.233
manipulating her scar tissue to
relieve her of her symptoms,

11:06.233 --> 11:08.567
but leaving her enough
soft tissue

11:08.567 --> 11:11.300
so that her breast
is aesthetically pleasing.

11:11.300 --> 11:15.166
We can do this, if you want,
but there's no guarantees

11:15.166 --> 11:17.266
that it's going to work.

11:17.266 --> 11:19.300
- It's very scary
when you don't know.

11:19.300 --> 11:21.533
Will it happen again?
Will I be in pain again?

11:21.533 --> 11:24.100
But I honestly have
such faith in Dr. Dubrow,

11:24.100 --> 11:25.700
I feel great about it.
I feel really great.

11:25.700 --> 11:27.266
It sounds right to me.

11:27.266 --> 11:28.300
- It sounds right.
It feels right.

11:28.300 --> 11:30.166
- Yeah. It feels right.

11:30.166 --> 11:31.533
I'm ready. I'm ready.
We're gonna do that.

11:31.533 --> 11:35.033
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure to meet you.

11:35.033 --> 11:37.033
- My name is Christina,
I'm 40 years old,

11:37.033 --> 11:39.166
and I'm the twin
with the twisted nose.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.767
My nose looks like
a hockey stick.

11:41.767 --> 11:43.433
It's very crooked.

11:43.433 --> 11:46.000
I loved to travel a lot
when I was a kid.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.467
I think it had a lot to do with
having an identical twin sister.

11:48.467 --> 11:51.600
We were a military family
and so we were never nervous

11:51.600 --> 11:54.400
about moving to a new town,
and making new friends,

11:54.400 --> 11:58.533
'cause we always had
our best bud moving with us.

11:58.533 --> 12:02.333
In 2005, I was t-boned
on my left side.

12:02.333 --> 12:06.066
My car was crushed, and I had
to be sawed out of my car.

12:06.066 --> 12:07.333
I sustained a lot of injuries.

12:07.333 --> 12:09.166
I had broken ribs,

12:09.166 --> 12:10.333
my left lung collapsed,

12:10.333 --> 12:12.166
and my pelvis was shattered.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.567
The pain from my car accident
was excruciating.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.200
I remember, at one time,
staring at the ceiling

12:17.200 --> 12:20.066
and I just wanted to die.

12:20.066 --> 12:22.166
After my accident,
it took four or five years

12:22.166 --> 12:24.266
for me to notice
that my nose was changing.

12:24.266 --> 12:27.600
It was twisting to the left,

12:27.600 --> 12:29.767
and I was having difficulty
breathing.

12:29.767 --> 12:32.500
I went to go see an ENT,
and he said more than likely

12:32.500 --> 12:35.066
I hit my face
during that car accident,

12:35.066 --> 12:37.600
but then over time
it slowly shifted.

12:37.600 --> 12:41.233
The ENT said that he would be
able to do surgery on my nose.

12:41.233 --> 12:44.433
After my surgery, my nose
was pretty good for a month.

12:44.433 --> 12:47.333
And then after the month,
it slowly started twisting

12:47.333 --> 12:50.200
in the same direction it did
after my car accident,

12:50.200 --> 12:53.100
but it was shifting farther.

12:53.100 --> 12:55.567
I was crying all the time,
I was just miserable,

12:55.567 --> 12:57.333
and that's no way to live.

12:57.333 --> 13:00.467
And so I just told myself
not to look at it,

13:00.467 --> 13:02.200
not to look in the mirror,
and so

13:02.200 --> 13:04.066
from that day,
I just stopped,

13:04.066 --> 13:08.467
'cause I just didn't,
you know, want to see it.

13:08.467 --> 13:10.633

Many years ago, she got into
a car accident,

13:15.200 --> 13:19.066
went to a local doctor,
had septum rhinoplasty.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.133
Let's go take a peek.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.400
Ooh, her tip is
completely deformed.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.133

inside her nose.

Christine?

13:30.100 --> 13:33.467

- If the doctors decide that
they can't fix my nose,

13:37.600 --> 13:42.266
I will not look to have
another surgeon do it,

13:42.266 --> 13:45.367
because if the best of the best
can't fix it,

13:45.367 --> 13:48.400
then I really don't want to
trust anybody else.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.433
- Welcome.
Let's talk about your trauma

13:50.433 --> 13:52.500
and your motor vehicle accident.
Tell us about that.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.433
- It happened 15 years ago.
I was T-boned.

13:54.433 --> 13:57.400
My lungs collapsed, so weren't
even worried about my face

13:57.400 --> 13:59.500
at the time, they were just
worried about saving my life.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.133
- Did they know
you had nasal fracture?

14:01.133 --> 14:02.567
- No, not at the time.

14:02.567 --> 14:04.367
It took several years
for it to start twisting,

14:04.367 --> 14:05.633
it was like a slow progression.

14:05.633 --> 14:07.300
So I went to an ENT doctor,

14:07.300 --> 14:08.567
and I could tell
he was a little hesitant,

14:08.567 --> 14:10.667
because they don't
have the specialty,

14:10.667 --> 14:12.533
as plastic surgeons do.
- Right.

14:12.533 --> 14:15.033
- But he went in with
the more senior doctor.

14:15.033 --> 14:18.233
- Well they were arguing before
she went under anesthesia,

14:18.233 --> 14:21.667
about how to proceed.
I don't think they had a plan.

14:21.667 --> 14:24.400
- If I was the patient, and two
doctors are fighting over me

14:24.400 --> 14:27.700
about what they're gonna do, I'd
cancel that surgery immediately,

14:27.700 --> 14:29.367

he decided to divorce me

14:35.600 --> 14:37.400
for another person.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.333
And that was just probably
as excruciating

14:40.333 --> 14:42.266
as the car accident.
- The car accident.

14:42.266 --> 14:44.266
- When I was in the car with
you, I was just crying

14:44.266 --> 14:46.200
about the divorce, and crying
about my car accident.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.734
- I was like there has to be
something doctors can do.

14:47.734 --> 14:51.133
- And I was like on top of it,
my nose is so messed up.

14:51.133 --> 14:53.333
After my surgery,
when it started going back

14:53.333 --> 14:56.200
to being crooked,
I was obsessing over it a lot.

14:56.200 --> 14:59.333
And I was trying to see if
I could stop it from twisting.

14:59.333 --> 15:03.433
I would put a tampon in my right
nostril when I slept.

15:03.433 --> 15:06.166
- You put a tampon in your nose
to help you breathe better?

15:06.166 --> 15:09.200
- Well, no, to try to--to see if
I could open it up.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.433
So when I pulled it out
the next day,

15:10.433 --> 15:12.467
maybe I would breathe better.

15:12.467 --> 15:14.233
- Okay, so yeah, you're not
doing it to breathe at night,

15:14.233 --> 15:16.166
you're doing it
to open up the airway.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.500
So let's go to the exam room.
- Okay.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.300
- Let's take a peek inside
and outside.

15:20.300 --> 15:22.200
- After my divorce,
I just felt

15:22.200 --> 15:24.200
extremely rejected
and unloved,

15:24.200 --> 15:26.333
and I had no control over it.

15:26.333 --> 15:29.166
My nose is the one thing
that I do have control over,

15:29.166 --> 15:31.500
that I am able to go
and get fixed.

15:31.500 --> 15:34.166
So it's really, like, a show
of love towards myself.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.600
- I'm gonna do a little bit
of feeling your nose here.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.367
What we call the lower half
of your nose,

15:37.367 --> 15:39.467
where all the cartilage is,
is what's messed up.

15:39.467 --> 15:42.333
Basically, the doctor just took
so much cartilage away

15:42.333 --> 15:44.767
that your tip, it's called
the dome, deformed.

15:44.767 --> 15:47.233
With Christina's nose, we have
another hard case here.

15:47.233 --> 15:50.500
Her septum is deviated
in multiple directions,

15:50.500 --> 15:53.433
and this is why severe trauma

15:53.433 --> 15:56.266
and bad surgery equals disaster.

15:56.266 --> 15:59.333
What we have to do is one,
get your septum straight.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.233
We'll take down
that little hump right here--

16:01.233 --> 16:02.533
- Mm-hmm.
- And then reconstruct the tip

16:02.533 --> 16:04.400
of your nose, the cartilage.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.633
And then we have to reconstruct
the outside

16:05.633 --> 16:07.633
to make it look straight.
- Awesome.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.400
What are the risks
associated with this surgery?

16:10.400 --> 16:13.667
Is the cartilage memory.
Some of that crookedness

16:13.667 --> 16:15.533
can come back.
- Mm-hmm.

16:15.533 --> 16:17.734
- So if you, in your mind,
can say, "Listen,

16:17.734 --> 16:20.400
"if I get a 75-80% improvement,"

16:20.400 --> 16:21.533
you're happy with that?

16:21.533 --> 16:23.233

16:23.233 --> 16:25.467

17:42.734 --> 17:46.600
no breast tissue, so if you take
out too much scar tissue,

17:46.600 --> 17:50.133
it's gonna be a very ripply
situation with no soft tissue

17:50.133 --> 17:53.333
protection, and could make her
actually worse.

17:53.333 --> 17:54.600
- Well, let's not do that.

17:54.600 --> 17:55.734
- For Kim's surgery today,

17:55.734 --> 17:57.467
I will make an incision around

17:57.467 --> 17:58.600
the bottom half
of her areolas,

17:58.600 --> 18:00.700
and remove both
of her old implants.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.633
I will then excise
the scar tissue

18:02.633 --> 18:04.433
that is causing
the grade four encapsulation

18:04.433 --> 18:06.233
on Kim's right breast,

18:06.233 --> 18:08.500
leaving enough to maintain
a good shape,

18:08.500 --> 18:09.767
and not cause rippling.

18:09.767 --> 18:11.567
I will then place a new pair

18:11.567 --> 18:13.467
of implants
in each breast pocket

18:13.467 --> 18:15.767
giving her an appropriate size
for her frame.

18:15.767 --> 18:19.100
All the while making sure both
breasts are symmetrical.

18:19.100 --> 18:22.166
- Wow, look how big
that capsule is.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.767
You can already see how deep
and thick it is.

18:24.767 --> 18:27.233
How thick is her soft tissue?

18:27.233 --> 18:31.100
- It is about 6 millimeters.

18:31.100 --> 18:34.633
What you really like to see, in
terms of soft tissue thickness

18:34.633 --> 18:37.767
overlying a breast implant,
is at least 2 centimeters,

18:37.767 --> 18:39.767
which is 20 millimeters.

18:39.767 --> 18:44.200
In Kim's case, she only has
6 millimeters,

18:44.200 --> 18:46.533
that's 1/3 of what you need

18:46.533 --> 18:49.266
to have safe coverage
overlying an implant.

18:49.266 --> 18:52.467
Look how chalky the capsule is.

18:52.467 --> 18:54.667
It's squeezing so much
on this saline implant,

18:54.667 --> 18:58.133
I'm afraid I'm gonna rupture it
pulling it out.

18:58.133 --> 19:01.633
Kim's saline implant, it's not
only under a great amount

19:01.633 --> 19:04.000
of pressure from the
surrounding scar tissue,

19:04.000 --> 19:08.667
but there's all these sharp
edges of calcified capsule

19:08.667 --> 19:11.133
inside,
which could cut a hole in it.

19:11.133 --> 19:15.667
Just want to make
no false moves.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.266
- Ai-yi-yi.
- Yeah.

19:17.266 --> 19:19.000
- Nasty capsule.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.667
- So...
- Ugh. Oh, God.

19:22.667 --> 19:27.033
- Yeah, her capsule
is so thick,

19:27.033 --> 19:31.166
that it's given her
its own...

19:31.166 --> 19:34.166
scar tissue structure
to her breast.

19:34.166 --> 19:37.033
That's what the inside of Kim's
breast looks like.

19:37.033 --> 19:41.166
This is all
calcium material.

19:41.166 --> 19:42.700
- She's got drywall in here,
basically.

19:42.700 --> 19:44.700
- Yeah, it's plaster.

19:44.700 --> 19:47.033
- Oh, there's tons of it.
Look at this stuff

19:47.033 --> 19:49.300
you can pull out of here.
Do you have, um...

19:49.300 --> 19:51.133
something to scrape
it with, Heidi?

19:53.033 --> 19:55.700
- Would that--do you want me
to get that brow tray thing?

19:55.700 --> 19:57.567
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you can get that.

19:57.567 --> 20:00.433
- I have to use a special tool
on Kim's breast today

20:00.433 --> 20:04.166
called a periosteal elevator,
that's designed to scrape

20:04.166 --> 20:08.066
the top of bone off,
because in order to preserve

20:08.066 --> 20:11.734
the capsule that I need
for her soft tissue thickness,

20:11.734 --> 20:14.734
I need to relieve her
of that hard,

20:14.734 --> 20:16.734
crusty material on the inside,

20:16.734 --> 20:18.333
so the capsule will expand.

20:18.333 --> 20:21.200
Do you hear that?

20:21.200 --> 20:23.200
It's not very often
you hear this kind of...

20:26.333 --> 20:27.533
Sound coming from

20:27.533 --> 20:32.066
the inside...
of a breast.

20:32.066 --> 20:35.734
At least it's now, just good,
thick, soft tissue now.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.333
We've preserved the thickness.

20:37.333 --> 20:39.734
Now that I've removed
a lot of scar tissue

20:39.734 --> 20:42.200
from the inside
of Kim's breast pocket,

20:42.200 --> 20:44.533
and allow her
to get a good breast shape,

20:44.533 --> 20:46.300
it's time
to put the implant in.

20:47.734 --> 20:49.367
Okay.

20:49.367 --> 20:51.166
Let's see what's going on
on this side.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.633
Kim's left breast is very soft,

20:53.633 --> 20:55.633
the nipple has descended
a little bit,

20:55.633 --> 20:58.367
because the crease--
the breast crease

20:58.367 --> 21:01.767
has elevated due to minor
scar tissue formation.

21:01.767 --> 21:04.233
All I have to do is lower it
a little bit

21:04.233 --> 21:06.100
in order to make it look good.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.200
All right,
sit her up please.

21:10.767 --> 21:13.633
Good, right?
I'm actually super pleased

21:13.633 --> 21:15.367
with the symmetry
I've got between

21:15.367 --> 21:17.767
the right calcified breast,

21:17.767 --> 21:21.033
and the left,
non-calcified breast.

21:21.033 --> 21:23.166
I think I got
a little bit lucky today.

21:23.166 --> 21:26.333
We're good.
All right, closing.

- That was probably

22:38.700 --> 22:40.433
one of my favorite procedures
I ever had done.

22:40.433 --> 22:41.433
Getting my
sweat glands removed,

22:41.433 --> 22:43.166
and not sweating.

22:43.166 --> 22:44.433

want to do it myself.

- Yay.

22:47.433 --> 22:49.166
- Speaking of procedures...

22:49.166 --> 22:52.166

Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow

22:52.166 --> 22:55.133

As you know, I look up to them.
- Yeah.

22:57.066 --> 22:59.333
- I approach piercing
they way they approach surgery.

22:59.333 --> 23:02.000
- Remember that girl that
you had to fix her piercing?

23:02.000 --> 23:04.266
Like the doctor didn't know
how to take it out,

23:04.266 --> 23:06.734
so he cut a hole--
triangle, right?

23:06.734 --> 23:09.333
- Well that's what you get when
you go in someplace

23:09.333 --> 23:10.734

23:10.734 --> 23:12.333
I am a creative and aesthetic

23:12.333 --> 23:14.734
body piercing artist,
but I also specialize

23:14.734 --> 23:16.333
in revision piercing.

23:16.333 --> 23:18.200
When people mess up,

23:18.200 --> 23:20.734
I fix their mistakes
just like the doctors.

23:20.734 --> 23:22.066
- What do you think
they're gonna say

23:22.066 --> 23:23.400
about your piercings, though?

23:23.400 --> 23:25.200
- They're probably
gonna be so overwhelmed

23:25.200 --> 23:27.000
and shocked by me.
- I know.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.333

23:28.333 --> 23:30.734
"Whoa, I need sunglasses."

- When I'm lifting up the skin,
and kind of rebuilding this,

23:34.367 --> 23:36.100
are you gonna be
feeling any of that?

- I might. I'll be like,
"Dr. Nassif, stop.

23:39.500 --> 23:41.233

your nose, right?

23:41.233 --> 23:43.767
- Well I figured
while I was under--

23:43.767 --> 23:45.367
- You could possibly

24:15.500 --> 24:18.533
I can't be with you
during the surgery,

24:18.533 --> 24:21.533
but I'm emotionally,
spiritually--I'm here with you.

24:21.533 --> 24:24.533

question I have to ask you,

24:24.533 --> 24:27.266
she's gonna be sleeping
under anesthesia,

24:27.266 --> 24:29.667
when I'm lifting up the skin
and kind of rebuilding this,

24:29.667 --> 24:31.400
are you going to be feeling
any of that, or...?

24:31.400 --> 24:33.633
- I might.
I'll be like, "Dr. Nassif, stop.

24:33.633 --> 24:36.000
It hurts."
- If you do feel any pain,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.266
just be quiet about it.
- I will, I will.

24:38.266 --> 24:39.467
I love you.
- Don't worry, we'll take

24:39.467 --> 24:41.000
good care of her.
- Okay.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.600
- The challenging part
of this case

24:42.600 --> 24:44.400
is the cartilage memory.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.000
Getting the nose symmetrical.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.667
I might be able to get it
pretty good on the table,

24:48.667 --> 24:51.266
but really what's gonna be
the important part

24:51.266 --> 24:53.533
is how does
Christina's nose heal

24:53.533 --> 24:55.667
in the long run,
because of cartilage?

24:55.667 --> 24:58.233
The cartilage can warp
all over again.

24:58.233 --> 25:01.233
Today for Christina's surgery,
my team will harvest rib

25:01.233 --> 25:03.633
while I make incision across
the lower columella

25:03.633 --> 25:05.567
lifting the skin
off her twisted tip.

25:05.567 --> 25:07.300
Then I'll remove the majority

25:07.300 --> 25:09.233
of her damaged
septal cartilage.

25:09.233 --> 25:11.367
I'll use fresh cartilage
from the rib to straighten

25:11.367 --> 25:13.567
the deviated septum,
and insert spreader grafts

25:13.567 --> 25:16.700
on the side of her nose to
make the middle vault symmetric.

25:16.700 --> 25:19.567
Finally I'll fix the indentation
on her left side,

25:19.567 --> 25:21.300
and open her airway on the right

25:21.300 --> 25:23.300
by attaching
alar batten grafts

25:23.300 --> 25:25.567
which will hopefully give her
a nose she won't mind

25:25.567 --> 25:28.233
looking at in the mirror.
All right, so here's where

25:28.233 --> 25:30.500
the problem is
in the symmetry.

25:30.500 --> 25:33.300
The right,
lower lateral cartilage

25:33.300 --> 25:36.433
is a little dominant,
and it's convex,

25:36.433 --> 25:38.567
so what can we do
to make this cartilage

25:38.567 --> 25:40.734
look more like
the right cartilage?

25:40.734 --> 25:44.600
Since Christina's nose
has been shifted to the left,

25:44.600 --> 25:46.600
there will be tendency
for that cartilage

25:46.600 --> 25:48.600
to shift back there.
We want to remove

25:48.600 --> 25:51.734
as much cartilage
as possible to decrease that,

25:51.734 --> 25:53.467
we just have
to have enough cartilage

25:53.467 --> 25:54.600
to support the nose.

25:54.600 --> 25:57.066
Maybe attach it to the left side

25:57.066 --> 26:00.266
so that it's actually
stuck down?

26:00.266 --> 26:01.600
It might just give us that
little extra

26:01.600 --> 26:03.333
blanket of security.

26:03.333 --> 26:06.467
Let's see your septal extension.
This is nice.

26:06.467 --> 26:08.066
I'll stitch this
to the left side

26:08.066 --> 26:11.200
of anterior nasal spine.
What's that gonna do

26:11.200 --> 26:14.667
is 100% make sure
we don't get redeviation

26:14.667 --> 26:16.467
of the septum to the right.

26:16.467 --> 26:19.333
Since Christina's septum
was extremely deviated,

26:19.333 --> 26:22.100
we use something called
the septal batten graft.

26:22.100 --> 26:25.367
It basically is helping in
forcing the tip of the septum,

26:25.367 --> 26:27.633
which is crooked,
will help keep it straight,

26:27.633 --> 26:29.633
so that it won't go left
or right again.

26:29.633 --> 26:32.100
This piece of cartilage that
we're putting now in the middle,

26:32.100 --> 26:34.633
will help get the tip
more centered.

26:34.633 --> 26:37.367
The whole coup de grace
of Christina's surgery

26:37.367 --> 26:39.767
was making her nasal tip
more symmetric.

26:39.767 --> 26:42.300
Okay, we did a fantastic job.
The middle vault's straight,

26:42.300 --> 26:44.633
the tip is straight.
She's still gonna have some

26:44.633 --> 26:46.367
alar asymmetry,

26:46.367 --> 26:47.734
but this is the best
we're gonna do.

- It's too hot. Hold on.

27:13.266 --> 27:15.133
- It's funny how certain topics
will make you sweat.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.500
- No, you were on the phone.
- This is definitely a topic

27:16.500 --> 27:18.400
that makes you sweat.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.000
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.667
This definitely
raises your metabolic rate.

27:22.667 --> 27:25.133
'Cause you're afraid I'm gonna
touch on something embarrassing.

27:25.133 --> 27:26.667
- Yes.

27:26.667 --> 27:28.533
- Keep talking.
- Yeah, it's the topic.

27:28.533 --> 27:29.667
No question.

27:29.667 --> 27:31.467
Okay, I'm gonna say it.

27:31.467 --> 27:33.333
I just love
making Paul sweat.

27:33.333 --> 27:34.467
- So we have a patient
from Boston.

27:34.467 --> 27:36.000
- Oh, okay.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
- Name is Joey,
and he's had a couple

27:38.000 --> 27:39.600
of rhinoplasties.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.533
- We do have pictures.
- Let's see.

27:41.533 --> 27:43.400
- Whoa.
- He's "enthusi-ass"--

27:43.400 --> 27:45.433
enthusiast.
- He's enthusi-asstically

27:45.433 --> 27:47.166
into plastic surgery.
- Okay, let's look at his nose

27:47.166 --> 27:48.700
for a second in his profile.
Oh wait a minute.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.433
Is that piercing on his cheeks?
- Oh, wow.

27:50.433 --> 27:51.700
- Look he's got piercing
in his buckle area.

27:51.700 --> 27:54.300
- Oh, my God.
We gotta meet this guy.

27:55.700 --> 27:57.767
- If I had to get a piercing,

27:57.767 --> 28:01.700
it would be
in Paul's right nipple,

28:01.700 --> 28:03.367
so I could just pull on it

28:03.367 --> 28:04.500
and bring him
into the exam room

28:04.500 --> 28:06.400
when he's talking too much.

28:07.700 --> 28:10.166
- Joey, I'm Dr. Nassif.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.367
- I'm Joey, nice to meet you.
- Hi, Joey. Terry Dubrow.

28:12.367 --> 28:13.433
- So nice to meet you.
- Hi.

28:13.433 --> 28:15.033
- Yes.

28:15.033 --> 28:16.033
- Meeting Dr. Nassif
and Dr. Dubrow

28:16.033 --> 28:17.633
is so exciting.

28:17.633 --> 28:19.700
I'm a little nervous, though,
at the same time,

28:19.700 --> 28:22.033
to see what they have to say,
but I'm pretty sure

28:22.033 --> 28:23.767
they'll be able to give me
exactly what I want.

28:23.767 --> 28:26.734
- Yes, south of Boston.

28:26.734 --> 28:28.467
- Quincy.

28:28.467 --> 28:30.600
- Quincy! All my relatives
are in Hingham.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.734
- I pierce right next
to Hingham, in Hanover.

28:34.467 --> 28:35.734
- So I probably pierced
your family.

28:35.734 --> 28:37.600
- Nah, I don't think
you pierced them.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.133
They're a little too old
for that.

28:39.133 --> 28:40.600
- You never know.
- So that's what you do

28:40.600 --> 28:41.600
for a living,
you pierce people?

28:41.600 --> 28:42.734
- Yep.

28:42.734 --> 28:44.533
- How many piercings
do you have?

28:44.533 --> 28:47.066
- I have about 50 piercings.
- 50!

28:47.066 --> 28:49.000
- Yep.
- Do you have any in the, uh...

28:49.000 --> 28:51.400
private areas?
- Yeah, on the frenulum.

28:51.400 --> 28:53.600
- On the frenulum. Okay.
So the lower--okay.

28:53.600 --> 28:57.200
Do you have any
in the anal/rectal area?

28:57.200 --> 28:59.467
- Um, kind of.

28:59.467 --> 29:01.066
- Yes.

29:01.066 --> 29:03.200
You know the taint?

29:03.200 --> 29:05.467
You're really asking
this guy about his taint?

29:05.467 --> 29:07.533
- If someone said what's
the taint, what would you say?

29:07.533 --> 29:09.633
- A taint, the ass,
the taint, the balls.

29:09.633 --> 29:12.033
Or something like that.

29:12.033 --> 29:14.633
- A taint, the ass,
and a taint, the balls?

29:14.633 --> 29:18.100
Who knew after this long
of a period of time

29:18.100 --> 29:20.633
of being a board-certified
plastic surgeon

29:20.633 --> 29:24.433
I would learn something
new about human anatomy?

29:24.433 --> 29:26.367
- All right, well let's
get to it then.

29:26.367 --> 29:28.100
Your nose.
- Yes.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.100
- Two rhinoplasties.
Tell us about that.

29:30.100 --> 29:32.700
- So during
my first rhinoplasty,

29:32.700 --> 29:36.233
the surgeon
put an implant that went

29:36.233 --> 29:37.633
over the bridge.
It went from pretty much

29:37.633 --> 29:39.633
there to there.
- It just weird,

29:39.633 --> 29:42.633
because when you have
already a nose

29:42.633 --> 29:44.633
that's sticking out
a good amount,

29:44.633 --> 29:47.767
you don't add a silicone--
was it silicone or gortex?

29:47.767 --> 29:49.700
- Gortex.
- Sometimes,

29:49.700 --> 29:52.533
if you're over aggressive,
taking a bump down,

29:52.533 --> 29:54.400
and you look you go, "Ugh!"

29:54.400 --> 29:57.233
- You took too much.
- You can take that piece off

29:57.233 --> 29:59.533
that you took off
and put it back on,

29:59.533 --> 30:02.633
but if they filed it,
you can't put shavings back on.

30:02.633 --> 30:07.000
So I suspect he was--
as a salvage, he went, "Ugh,"

30:07.000 --> 30:10.200
and took a piece of gortex,
and just laid it on there.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.066
- Yeah.

30:12.066 --> 30:14.667
- Well, the implant
had slipped down,

30:14.667 --> 30:16.667
and broke through my septum.

30:16.667 --> 30:19.500
Did you see it popping out?
- I didn't see it, I felt it.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.066
- Yep.

30:21.066 --> 30:23.133
- They wheel in

30:23.133 --> 30:25.600
a rhinoplasty surgical kit.

30:25.600 --> 30:28.266
He clamps onto it,
with--uses a scalpel--

30:28.266 --> 30:30.000
- Just right there
in the exam room?

30:30.000 --> 30:32.700
- Right there in the exam room.
So he uses a scalpel

30:32.700 --> 30:34.700
to try and trim it,
and tells me don't move.

30:34.700 --> 30:36.567
Okay.

30:36.567 --> 30:38.133
And leave it in?
- He's gonna trim it,

30:38.133 --> 30:39.767
and push it in,
so it hopefully--

30:39.767 --> 30:41.300
That's gonna work.

30:41.300 --> 30:42.767
- That's like an exposed
breast implant.

30:42.767 --> 30:45.567
- I know.
Joey's extraordinarily lucky

30:45.567 --> 30:48.166
that he didn't suffer
a very significant infection

30:48.166 --> 30:50.567
by having the exposed implant
pushed back in,

30:50.567 --> 30:52.767
because once it becomes
exposed,

30:52.767 --> 30:55.700
it theoretically becomes
colonized with bacteria,

30:55.700 --> 30:58.166
and if you put it back in,
that bacteria can then

30:58.166 --> 31:02.033
continue to grow, and form
a very dangerous infection.

31:02.033 --> 31:04.300
- It obviously didn't work.
It was hanging out

31:04.300 --> 31:06.667
more after,
so I think it was about

31:06.667 --> 31:09.033
a week and a half,
two weeks later,

31:09.033 --> 31:11.433
that I had been going in
for surgery to have

31:11.433 --> 31:14.066
the implant removed.
So when the implant came out,

31:14.066 --> 31:17.467
I'm left with just
kind of like a bumpy--

31:17.467 --> 31:19.066
where I would
like it to be like

31:19.066 --> 31:21.166
thinner, like chiseled.

31:21.166 --> 31:23.200
- So it's all about
your nose, right?

31:23.200 --> 31:25.333
- Well I figured,
while I was under--

31:25.333 --> 31:27.266
- You could possibly

31:27.266 --> 31:29.066
make my butt implants
a little bit bigger.

31:29.066 --> 31:31.133
- Just get it all done

31:31.133 --> 31:32.600
and over with at once.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.200
- Do you have any problem
with them?

31:34.200 --> 31:37.467
- No, I think
they're a great start...

31:37.467 --> 31:39.600
- Yeah.
- But a little more projection

31:39.600 --> 31:41.200
would be...
- All right, well,

31:41.200 --> 31:43.066
we'll look at that area.
- Best thing to do

31:43.066 --> 31:45.200
is go in the operating room
and examine you, okay?

31:45.200 --> 31:47.000
- Awesome.
- Let's go do that.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.567
- And the taint one is--
It's closer to the butt.

31:50.567 --> 31:52.200
Right?

31:52.200 --> 31:55.100
Did you measure it?
It's just taint right.

31:55.100 --> 31:57.767
- Having the surgery and taking
time out to focus on myself

31:57.767 --> 32:00.100
really helped me work through
a lot of the pain

32:00.100 --> 32:03.233
from my divorce.
- Oh, side by side.

32:03.233 --> 32:05.533
That's a mirror image!

32:11.100 --> 32:13.033
♪ I want to be perfect ♪

32:16.166 --> 32:18.100

One, two...
three, four, five.

32:27.233 --> 32:29.700
- I approach body piercing
the way the doctors approach

32:29.700 --> 32:32.700
plastic surgery, because we're
creating an open wound,

32:32.700 --> 32:35.033
we're putting something
in the body,

32:35.033 --> 32:37.266
and you need to make sure
it's going to heal properly.

32:37.266 --> 32:42.467
- And the taint one
is

32:42.467 --> 32:44.633
- It's right there.

32:44.633 --> 32:46.133
- Yeah.

32:46.133 --> 32:49.066
- It's closer to the butt.

32:49.066 --> 32:50.367
Right?
Did you measure it?

32:50.367 --> 32:52.400
Distance between the "mm"
and the "mm"

32:52.400 --> 32:54.133
and that's the--
split it in two?

32:54.133 --> 32:56.066
- No, I just...

32:56.066 --> 32:58.066
- Marked where it was gonna be
aesthetically pleasing.

32:58.066 --> 32:59.367
- You're fascinated
with the taint.

32:59.367 --> 33:01.667
It just "taint" right.

33:01.667 --> 33:03.400
- Dr. Dubrow's looking
at my taint

33:03.400 --> 33:06.467
under hospital lighting,
basically.

33:06.467 --> 33:11.266
Usually it's only seen
in moonlight.

33:11.266 --> 33:13.467
- Why don't you get up
and let's show him the...

33:13.467 --> 33:15.333
Since you want him to--
- Yeah, let me see the buttock.

33:15.333 --> 33:17.200
- And especially
your incisions, too.

33:17.200 --> 33:18.467
- Yeah.

33:21.300 --> 33:24.433
- I think he healed really well.
These are big.

33:24.433 --> 33:26.700
You know you're actually very
lucky, Joey,

33:26.700 --> 33:30.166
because every time I've seen
implants this big put in,

33:30.166 --> 33:32.767
even though done properly,
intramuscularly,

33:32.767 --> 33:36.100
they move and they're a problem,
and you've done really well.

33:36.100 --> 33:38.367
- Well I was really good about
not sitting for six weeks.

33:39.667 --> 33:41.100
- So the pockets
really developed.

33:41.100 --> 33:42.300
- The fact that Joey has done

33:42.300 --> 33:45.033
so well,
and looks so good,

33:45.033 --> 33:49.100
it's better to leave
well enough alone,

33:49.100 --> 33:53.166
and not take on any risk of any
new possible complications.

33:53.166 --> 33:56.033
Trust me on this,
you've been fortunate.

33:56.033 --> 33:58.033
- Yeah.
- Because when you

33:58.033 --> 34:02.200
put a very large implant
in a very tight compartment,

34:02.200 --> 34:04.734
that's the tendency for the body
to reject it.

34:04.734 --> 34:06.333
- Okay.
- Your body right now,

34:06.333 --> 34:10.066
very happy.
- I do love it, so I will...

34:10.066 --> 34:11.433
- Absolutely take...

34:11.433 --> 34:13.133
your word for it. Yeah.

34:13.133 --> 34:14.533
- I'm so happy about that.
- Yeah.

34:14.533 --> 34:16.266
- All right, now let's talk
about your nose.

34:16.266 --> 34:17.734
- Let's look at the nose.
Yeah.

34:17.734 --> 34:20.734
- All right, let me feel.
Lower the chin.

34:20.734 --> 34:24.400
- Bones already refracting.
Look at the symmetry.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.467
- Yeah, he just held this
together too.

34:26.467 --> 34:30.133
- For sure. He was salvaging
it.

34:30.133 --> 34:32.066
- Usually when you have
an implant in the nose

34:32.066 --> 34:33.734
and it's taken out,
it leaves damage,

34:33.734 --> 34:37.467
but in Joey's situation,
his nose is very symmetric.

34:37.467 --> 34:40.066
- I can understand why you might
want it a bit more narrow,

34:40.066 --> 34:41.266
but it's too risky.

34:41.266 --> 34:42.500
You know,
I can tell your bones

34:42.500 --> 34:44.367
have already been fractured.

34:44.367 --> 34:46.100
When you fracture it again,

34:46.100 --> 34:47.767
it's gonna cave in,
it's gonna collapse.

34:47.767 --> 34:49.433
- Like, you really don't think
just like smooth--

34:49.433 --> 34:51.233
- No.
- You mess with it,

34:51.233 --> 34:55.100
I'm telling you, there's about
a good 50% chance

34:55.100 --> 34:58.233
that the symmetry that you have
now, will be gone forever,

34:58.233 --> 35:00.166
you could never get it back
perfectly.

35:00.166 --> 35:02.100
- Yeah.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.767
I am pretty upset that
Dr. Nassif won't touch my nose,

35:03.767 --> 35:06.367
but I understand if you're not
comfortable doing it,

35:06.367 --> 35:07.567
you don't do it.

It's almost like he's trying

36:00.400 --> 36:03.000

How's your nose?
Are you okay?

36:39.233 --> 36:40.433

which one had surgery

36:40.433 --> 36:42.233

the same?

36:42.233 --> 36:44.433

But I'm taking my pain med
in about 30 minutes,

36:56.266 --> 36:58.533
Ah, I need some more

37:00.200 --> 37:03.066
- Your septum was so deviated
to the right,

37:03.066 --> 37:06.533
I was worried about
it swinging back over,

37:06.533 --> 37:09.066
if I just fixated to the middle.

37:09.066 --> 37:12.467
So I added a piece of cartilage
from here, to down here.

37:12.467 --> 37:14.133
Stitch it a little bit
on the left side,

37:14.133 --> 37:15.600

overcorrecting it.

37:15.600 --> 37:18.667
So for sure I know that
it better not shoot back

37:18.667 --> 37:20.600
onto the right side.

Let me just show--Dr. Dubrow
and I, we're gonna look,

37:23.467 --> 37:27.200

- Oh, look at that.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.200
- Put your head back.
- It's beautiful.

37:28.200 --> 37:30.166
- That's perfection.

- I'm really happy the way
Christina's nose looks.

doesn't start

38:27.667 --> 38:29.633

38:29.633 --> 38:31.600
- That's a very good sign,
because obviously,

38:31.600 --> 38:35.133

in there and not stir up

38:35.133 --> 38:38.633
too much injury, so that we
don't wake the sleeping giant--

38:38.633 --> 38:40.533
- Yes,
- The immune system.

38:40.533 --> 38:45.266
What we found was intense
eggshell type encapsulation,

pasty material inside.

that it was this hard,

38:58.266 --> 39:00.100
That was in my body?"

39:00.100 --> 39:02.000
- Much more work done on
the right side than the left,

39:02.000 --> 39:04.266
so the right will heal at
a different pace than the left.

39:04.266 --> 39:06.433
- Okay. Don't look.
I'm not gonna look down.

39:06.433 --> 39:09.367

They're super good.
