00:13.613 --> 00:15.615
HELLO, MARK.

00:15.615 --> 00:18.018
ADAM... BEEN A LONG TIME.

00:18.418 --> 00:21.621
YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON
I THOUGHT I'D FIND HERE.

00:21.621 --> 00:23.623
I HEARD MALONE WAS SPEAKING.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.625
I WANTED TO HEAR HIM.

00:25.625 --> 00:27.627
I HOPED HE MIGHT'VE
LEARNED SOME THINGS FROM WHAT

00:28.028 --> 00:29.629
HAPPENED BACK AT GENOMEX.

00:29.629 --> 00:31.631
IF THERE'S A PROFIT TO
BE MADE IN AN ETHICAL VACUUM,

00:31.631 --> 00:34.034
DENNIS MALONE'S
GOING TO BE ALL OVER IT.

00:34.034 --> 00:38.038
I SOMETIMES WONDER HOW THINGS
MIGHT'VE BEEN DIFFERENT FOR ME,

00:38.038 --> 00:40.840
HAD I CHOSEN TO WORK ON YOUR
PROJECT INSTEAD OF MALONE'S.

00:40.840 --> 00:44.044
IT WASN'T JUST MALONE
THAT DOOMED GENOMEX.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.645
WE ALL MADE MISTAKES.

00:45.645 --> 00:48.448
THERE HE IS. DR. MALONE!

00:48.448 --> 00:50.850
CARLA REED, WXTY.

00:51.251 --> 00:54.054
YOU'RE ADVOCATING FUNDING
FOR A PLETHORA OF NEW GENE

00:54.054 --> 00:55.655
MANIPULATION TECHNOLOGIES.

00:55.655 --> 00:58.458
IS IT TRUE THAT MANY OF
THESE GENETIC TECHNOLOGIES HAVE

00:58.458 --> 01:00.860
BEEN ASSESSED AS POTENTIAL
THREATS BY EXPERTS AT THE WORLD

01:00.860 --> 01:02.862
HEALTH ORGANIZATION?

01:02.862 --> 01:06.066
"EXPERTS" ARRESTED
GALILEO WHEN HE SAID THAT THE
EARTH TRAVELED AROUND THE SUN.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.868
IS IT ALSO TRUE YOU'RE
RECOMMENDING THESE NEW GRANTS BE

01:08.868 --> 01:11.271
GIVEN MAINLY TO YOUR FRIENDS
AND FORMER ASSOCIATES OF THE

01:11.271 --> 01:13.273
GENOMEX CORPORATION?

01:13.273 --> 01:15.275
FUNDING GOES TO PEOPLE
WHO ARE ON THE CUTTING EDGE.

01:15.275 --> 01:16.876
PEOPLE WHO AREN'T
AFRAID TO TAKE CHANCES.

01:17.277 --> 01:19.679
EVEN IF THOSE CHANCES
THREATEN PUBLIC SAFETY?

01:20.080 --> 01:24.084
I ONLY ADVOCATE RESEARCH
WHICH IS CONDUCTED
IN A SECURE FACILITY.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.886
HUMAN COMFORT AND
HUMAN LIFE ARE NOT AT RISK.

01:26.886 --> 01:28.888
WHAT ASSURANCES DO
THE PUBLIC HAVE OF THIS?

01:28.888 --> 01:30.890
I'M AFRAID WE'RE DONE HERE.

01:30.890 --> 01:32.492
DR. MALONE...

01:32.492 --> 01:34.494
CARLA, THERE'S NO STORY HERE.

01:34.894 --> 01:36.496
LEAVE IT ALONE.

01:36.496 --> 01:38.498
COME ON, I JUST
HAVE A FEW MORE QUESTIONS.

01:38.498 --> 01:40.100
CARLA, I TOLD YOU... COME ON.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.502
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

01:42.502 --> 01:44.904
I'M TIRED AND I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

01:46.906 --> 01:48.908
WHAT DO YOU
CALL THIS MESS ANYWAY?

01:48.908 --> 01:50.910
THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.

01:50.910 --> 01:52.912
AND WHAT YOU DID WASN'T?

01:52.912 --> 01:55.315
WHAT'S THE MATTER, DOC?

01:55.315 --> 01:58.118
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE
JUST SEEN A GHOST.

01:58.518 --> 02:00.120
AGH... AGH...!

02:00.120 --> 02:01.721
VIC! COME ON.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.325
YOU GOTTA GET THIS!

02:05.325 --> 02:07.727
KEEP ROLLING.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.136
TELL ME YOU GOT THAT.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.538
IT HAPPENED SO FAST,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I GOT.

02:18.538 --> 02:20.140
<SIGH>

02:22.942 --> 02:26.146
HE'S DEAD.

02:29.749 --> 02:31.351
I AM ADAM KANE.

02:31.351 --> 02:33.753
I WAS A PIONEER
OF GENETIC RESEARCH,

02:33.753 --> 02:37.757
MANIPULATING DNA
TO SAVE HUMAN LIVES.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.960
BUT IN MANY, THEIR
GENES UNEXPECTEDLY MUTATED.

02:40.960 --> 02:44.964
THEY DEVELOPED
SUPERHUMAN ABILITIES.

03:12.592 --> 03:14.994
TOGETHER WITH FOUR
OF THE MOST POWERFUL,

03:14.994 --> 03:17.797
I FIGHT TO PROTECT A WORLD
THAT DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WE EXIST.

03:21.401 --> 03:22.602
WE ARE...

03:23.002 --> 03:25.004
MUTANT X.

03:29.842 --> 03:32.245
DENNIS MALONE WAS ONE
OF THE POWERS AT GENOMEX WHEN I

03:32.245 --> 03:35.048
ARRIVED, YOU KNOW, AND
THESE WERE THE GLORY DAYS.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.450
THESE WERE THE DAYS WHEN
WE HAD THE FREEDOM TO TAKE THE

03:37.450 --> 03:39.452
RESEARCH WHEREVER
WE WANTED IT TO GO.

03:39.452 --> 03:43.456
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE
ME, WHILE WE GET ALL
WARM AND FUZZY ABOUT YOUR,

03:43.456 --> 03:45.058
YOU KNOW, GOOD
OLD DAYS AT GENOMEX,

03:45.058 --> 03:47.460
BUT I'VE SEEN WHERE
THOSE GLORY DAYS ENDED UP.

03:47.460 --> 03:48.661
RIGHT.

03:48.661 --> 03:50.263
AND DENNIS MALONE WAS ONE
OF THE REASONS WHY, BUT WHEN I

03:50.663 --> 03:52.665
FOUND OUT WHERE HIS RESEARCH
WAS HEADED, I QUIT THE TEAM.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.267
AND WHERE WAS IT HEADED?

03:54.267 --> 03:56.669
HUMAN MODIFICATION.

03:56.669 --> 03:59.472
I MEAN, IT WAS HIS RESEARCH
THAT FORMED THE BASIS FOR ALL

03:59.472 --> 04:02.275
THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT GENOMEX
PERPETRATED ON ALL OF YOU.

04:02.275 --> 04:05.078
COULD YOU PLEASE NOT
USE THE WORD ADJUSTMENT?

04:05.078 --> 04:07.480
IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE
A SKIRT THAT GOT HEMMED.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.482
I'M SORRY.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.084
IT WAS A POOR CHOICE OF WORDS.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.285
OKAY?

04:12.285 --> 04:13.486
SO WE BECAME RIVALS.

04:13.886 --> 04:15.088
I MEAN, I HATED HIM.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.490
I MEAN, NOT THAT I COULD PUT
UP MUCH OF A FIGHT BECAUSE MY

04:17.490 --> 04:19.492
RESEARCH DIDN'T HAVE THE KIND OF
FINANCIAL UPSIDE THAT HIS DID.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.295
SO HE WAS ABLE
TO ATTRACT ALL THE GREATEST
MINDS IN THE COMPANY.

04:22.695 --> 04:24.297
SO, WHAT, AFTER
THE COLLAPSE OF GENOMEX,

04:24.297 --> 04:25.898
HE JUST TOOK THE
WHOLE SHOW ELSEWHERE?

04:26.299 --> 04:28.301
NO. ACTUALLY, HE
LEFT BEFORE THE COLLAPSE.

04:28.301 --> 04:30.303
YOU KNOW, ONE DAY HIS LAB WAS
JUST EMPTIED OUT AND EVERYBODY

04:30.303 --> 04:33.106
ON HIS TEAM JUST RESIGNED.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.709
SO DO YOU THINK
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT?

04:36.709 --> 04:38.311
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

04:38.311 --> 04:39.912
I GOT TO THE BODY,
THERE WERE NO MARKS.

04:40.313 --> 04:43.916
THERE WERE NO
SIGNS OF HOW HE DIED.

04:43.916 --> 04:47.520
WELL, YOU THINK MAYBE
THE LIMO DRIVER WAS A MUTANT?

04:47.520 --> 04:50.723
WELL, THAT'S A QUESTION THAT I'M
HOPING THE AUTOPSY WILL ANSWER.

04:50.723 --> 04:53.526
HMM... AND AS A PHYSICIAN
WHO WAS AT THE SCENE,

04:53.526 --> 04:56.329
I'M REQUIRED TO
FILE A REPORT ANYWAY.

04:56.329 --> 05:00.733
NO MOTIVE HAS BEEN DISCOVERED IN
THE SHOCKING UNEXPLAINED DEATH

05:00.733 --> 05:03.936
OF GENETIC RESEARCHER
DENNIS MALONE TODAY
AT THE CONVENTION CENTER.

05:03.936 --> 05:07.540
I'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS
BREAKING STORY AS INFORMATION
BECOMES AVAILABLE.

05:15.548 --> 05:17.150
RUN IT AGAIN.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.552
<SIGH>

05:24.757 --> 05:27.160
YOU SURE YOU
DON'T HAVE ANOTHER ANGLE?

05:27.560 --> 05:28.761
CARLA, I GOT ONE CAMERA.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.763
WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT I GOT.

05:30.763 --> 05:32.765
WELL, IT DIDN'T GET WHAT I SAW.

05:32.765 --> 05:35.168
<SIGH> THAT
DRIVER DID SOMETHING.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.769
IT WAS LIKE...

05:36.769 --> 05:38.371
GLOWING ENERGY WENT...

05:38.771 --> 05:40.373
RIGHT INTO MALONE'S CHEST.

05:40.373 --> 05:41.974
WELL, I DON'T SEE
ANY MARKS ON THE GUY.

05:42.375 --> 05:44.777
I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

05:44.777 --> 05:47.180
HEY, CARLA, IT'S YOUR CAREER.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.582
BUT, LET ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE
ADVICE: KEEP IT TO YOURSELF,

05:49.582 --> 05:52.385
OR YOUR NEXT ASSIGNMENT
MIGHT BE CHASING BAT-CHILD FOR

05:52.385 --> 05:54.387
THE WEEKLY WORLD NEWS.

05:54.387 --> 05:56.789
GRAB YOUR CAMERA AND LET'S GO.

05:56.789 --> 05:58.791
OKAY. WHERE WE GOING?

05:58.791 --> 06:01.594
I WANT TO HEAR WHAT
THE CORONER HAS TO SAY.

06:01.594 --> 06:03.596
GREAT.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.805
WHERE DO WE START?

06:12.805 --> 06:14.807
WELL, I DON'T THINK THEY'RE
GOING TO BE TOO FORTHCOMING

06:14.807 --> 06:16.409
WITH THE CORONER'S REPORT.

06:16.409 --> 06:18.010
WHY DON'T YOU TWO SEE
IF YOU CAN HELP THAT ALONG?

06:18.010 --> 06:18.811
OKAY.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.012
ALL RIGHT.

06:20.413 --> 06:23.216
WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME?

06:23.616 --> 06:25.218
WHO'S THIS GUY?

06:25.218 --> 06:27.620
WELL, THAT'S MARK KEARNEY.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.222
HE'S A BRILLIANT STUDENT.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.024
HE JOINED
MALONE'S TEAM JUST BEFORE
THE WHOLE THING FELL APART.

06:32.024 --> 06:34.827
WHEN DID THEY START PACKAGING
RESEARCHERS LIKE THAT?

06:34.827 --> 06:36.829
SO, WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.232
UH, THEY'RE NOT LETTING MUCH
OUT, BUT I GET THE FEELING THEY

06:39.232 --> 06:41.234
THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING
STRANGE ABOUT THE DEATH.

06:41.234 --> 06:45.638
I GET THE FEELING THAT
YOU THINK THE SAME THING.

06:46.038 --> 06:48.040
WELL, YOU WERE THERE.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.042
YOU KNOW AS MUCH AS I DO.

06:50.443 --> 06:52.044
I'M SORRY.

06:52.044 --> 06:53.646
THIS IS SHALIMAR FOX.

06:54.046 --> 06:58.851
WE WORK TOGETHER.

06:58.851 --> 07:03.256
SO DO YOU KNOW WHY SOMEBODY
WOULD WANT TO KILL HIM?

07:03.656 --> 07:05.658
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE?

07:05.658 --> 07:06.859
YOU'RE INVESTIGATING?

07:07.260 --> 07:08.060
YEAH.

07:08.461 --> 07:10.062
I WANT TO KNOW...

07:10.062 --> 07:11.664
IF THERE'S A CONNECTION
BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENED TO MALONE

07:11.664 --> 07:14.066
AND WHAT WAS
GOING ON AT GENOMEX.

07:14.066 --> 07:15.268
HMM.

07:15.668 --> 07:17.270
UH, HOW MUCH DOES SHE KNOW?

07:17.270 --> 07:18.871
EVERYTHING.

07:18.871 --> 07:21.274
SHE'S PART OF IT ALL.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.276
A MUTANT?

07:23.276 --> 07:25.678
SO YOU HAVE KEPT UP
YOUR GENE RESEARCH AFTER ALL?

07:25.678 --> 07:28.080
WELL, I SAW WHAT WAS
GOING ON AT GENOMEX, TOO.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.684
AND WE'RE PART
OF A TEAM THAT'S TRYING TO
CLEAN UP SOME OF THAT MESS.

07:32.084 --> 07:36.088
AND SPEAKING
OF THAT MESS, ARE YOU
GOING TO ANSWER HIS QUESTION?

07:36.489 --> 07:38.891
LOOK, WHAT WE DID AT
GENOMEX WAS SIMPLE RESEARCH.

07:38.891 --> 07:41.294
NOBODY OUTSIDE THE
ROOM KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT,

07:41.294 --> 07:43.296
AND I DON'T THINK
ANYONE WOULD CARE.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.298
MAYBE SOMEBODY CARED
ENOUGH TO KILL MALONE.

07:45.698 --> 07:48.100
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHO'D WANT HIM DEAD.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.102
IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS
SINCE WE WORKED TOGETHER.

07:50.102 --> 07:51.704
I HAVEN'T KEPT IN TOUCH.

07:51.704 --> 07:53.306
SORRY.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.108
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

07:56.509 --> 07:59.312
I'M SURE WE'LL MEET AGAIN.

08:02.915 --> 08:04.917
HE'S LYING.

08:04.917 --> 08:06.519
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

08:06.519 --> 08:08.120
MAYBE IT'S JUST
PROTOCOL, YOU KNOW?

08:08.521 --> 08:11.324
GENOMEX MAY BE GONE BUT WHAT'S
CLASSIFIED IS STILL CLASSIFIED.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.326
I DON'T KNOW.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.128
HE DOESN'T STRIKE ME
AS THE TYPE TO FOLLOW PROTOCOL.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.336
YOU ROLLING?

08:23.336 --> 08:25.738
I GOTTA TELL YOU, CARLA,
CRASHING THE MORGUE IS NOT COOL.

08:25.738 --> 08:28.140
YOU WANT TO
KNOW WHAT'S NOT COOL.

08:28.140 --> 08:30.142
NOT BREAKING A MURDER
CASE THAT'S SITTING RIGHT

08:30.543 --> 08:32.945
IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND.

08:36.948 --> 08:38.150
MAKE IT FAST.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.953
I'LL KEEP WATCH.

08:52.965 --> 08:58.571
HEY, DR. KEARNEY.

09:02.174 --> 09:04.577
THAT'S THE GUY
THAT KILLED MALONE.

09:14.987 --> 09:16.989
UGH!

09:41.814 --> 09:44.216
THAT'S THE GUY
THAT KILLED MALONE!

10:00.232 --> 10:03.836
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.

10:03.836 --> 10:08.240
WHY ARE YOU PROTECTING THEM?

10:08.240 --> 10:09.842
WE DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU.

10:09.842 --> 10:11.444
JUST GIVE UP.

10:11.444 --> 10:15.047
GIVE UP?

10:16.248 --> 10:19.051
GET IN.

10:27.059 --> 10:28.661
BRENNAN...

10:29.061 --> 10:30.663
HEY! HEY!

10:41.474 --> 10:45.878
OH... OH...!

10:45.878 --> 10:49.482
UGH...

10:53.085 --> 10:55.087
CARLA, I'M STARTING
TO LOSE BATTERY.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.490
KEEP SHOOTING.

11:04.296 --> 11:05.898
HE'S GONE.

11:05.898 --> 11:07.500
SO WHAT, THAT'S IT?

11:07.500 --> 11:11.504
I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

11:13.105 --> 11:16.308
I'VE JUST BROKEN
THE STORY OF MY CAREER.

11:20.312 --> 11:22.314
WHAT IS IT, EMMA?

11:31.924 --> 11:33.926
EMMA, WHAT?

11:40.833 --> 11:43.235
WE SHOULD BE SAFE HERE.

11:43.235 --> 11:45.638
THANKS FOR WHAT
YOU DID BACK THERE.

11:45.638 --> 11:48.040
IT'S WHAT WE DO.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.843
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN ADAM WOULD'VE
TURNED GENOMEX'S MISTAKES

11:50.843 --> 11:52.845
INTO SOMETHING GOOD.

11:52.845 --> 11:54.847
WELL, AS ONE
OF GENOMEX'S MISTAKES,

11:55.247 --> 11:58.050
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I SHOULD
BE INSULTED OR COMPLIMENTED?

11:58.451 --> 12:00.052
I'M SORRY.

12:00.052 --> 12:03.255
I JUST NEVER IMAGINED THAT THE
DREAM OF CREATING THE PERFECT

12:03.255 --> 12:06.058
BEING COULD EVER COME TRUE.

12:06.058 --> 12:12.064
GUESS WE SHOULD
GET YOU SOME PLACE SAFE.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.265
UH, NO.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.267
I... I'VE GOT TO
GET BACK TO THE CLINIC.

12:15.267 --> 12:16.869
I'VE GOT PATIENTS
I'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF.

12:17.269 --> 12:18.471
I CAN'T GIVE
UP THAT RESPONSIBILITY.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.072
COME ON, YOU SAW
WHAT THIS GUY COULD DO.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.074
HE THREW US
AROUND LIKE RAG DOLLS.

12:22.074 --> 12:27.680
I GOTTA GO.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.084
<SIGHS> THANKS AGAIN, SHALIMAR.

12:32.485 --> 12:35.287
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.493
I JUST
FINISHED STUDYING THE CORONER'S
REPORT ON DENNIS MALONE.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.094
AND?

12:42.094 --> 12:43.696
WELL, WHAT'S WEIRD, YOU KNOW?

12:43.696 --> 12:45.297
MALONE WAS FIFTY.

12:45.297 --> 12:47.299
THE REPORT SAYS THAT HIS
INSIDES WERE ALL BURNED OUT,

12:47.299 --> 12:49.301
LIKE THAT OF AN EIGHTY-YEAR-OLD.

12:49.301 --> 12:52.104
SO DID THE REPORT SAY
HOW THE LIMO DRIVER KILLED HIM?

12:52.104 --> 12:56.108
I DON'T THINK
IT WAS THE LIMO DRIVER.

12:56.108 --> 13:00.112
WHEN I HIT HIM WITH THE PSIONIC
BLAST, SOMETHING HAPPENED.

13:00.513 --> 13:04.517
IT WAS LIKE HE SPLIT
INTO TWO PEOPLE FOR A MINUTE.

13:04.917 --> 13:08.120
SCHIZOPHRENIC?

13:08.120 --> 13:10.523
IT WAS LIKE THERE
WAS ANOTHER CONSCIOUSNESS
LIVING INSIDE OF HIS BODY.

13:10.923 --> 13:14.126
WHOEVER IT WAS, HIS
FEELINGS WERE POWERFUL.

13:14.126 --> 13:17.329
HE WAS LOST AND...

13:17.730 --> 13:19.732
AND ANGRY, AND TORTURED.

13:19.732 --> 13:22.935
AND THEN, AFTERWARDS,
AFTER THE BODY DIED,

13:22.935 --> 13:25.337
I THINK THAT I STILL FELT HIM.

13:25.337 --> 13:26.539
WHAT?

13:26.939 --> 13:28.541
HE... HE SWITCHED BODIES?

13:28.541 --> 13:32.945
WELL, IT'S POSSIBLE.

13:32.945 --> 13:36.549
NOW, DID YOU HAVE ANY SENSE
ABOUT WHERE HE MIGHT'VE SHIFTED?

13:36.549 --> 13:39.351
THE EMOTIONS IN THE CROWD WERE
TOO STRONG TO PINPOINT ANYTHING.

13:39.351 --> 13:42.955
I MEAN, I WASN'T EVEN SURE
THAT IT HAPPENED AT THE TIME.

13:42.955 --> 13:44.957
ALL RIGHT.

13:45.357 --> 13:47.359
SO, WHATEVER, OR WHOEVER
IT IS, IS STILL OUT THERE, AND,

13:47.760 --> 13:51.363
SEEMS TO BE LOOKING
FOR YOUR FRIEND MARK KEARNEY.

13:51.363 --> 13:58.170
ADAM, IS THERE
SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT TELLING
US ABOUT MARK AND MALONE?

13:58.170 --> 14:02.174
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THIS:
THAT MALONE WAS WORKING ON A

14:02.575 --> 14:04.977
PROJECT CALLED
THE WALKER PROJECT.

14:05.377 --> 14:07.379
HE AND ANOTHER SCIENTIST
NAMED LEO MCALLISTER WERE

14:07.379 --> 14:10.983
SUPPOSEDLY STUDYING THE GENETIC
FACTORS THAT ALLOW CERTAIN

14:10.983 --> 14:16.188
PEOPLE THE POWER
OF ASTRAL PROJECTION.

14:16.589 --> 14:20.993
YOU MEAN, LIKE A SPIRIT THAT
CAN TRAVEL FROM BODY TO BODY...

14:20.993 --> 14:23.395
KILLING PEOPLE?

14:23.796 --> 14:24.997
I'M AFRAID SO.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.800
THERE, THERE.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.003
BLOW UP THAT FRAME.

14:31.003 --> 14:32.605
WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT?

14:32.605 --> 14:35.007
I DON'T KNOW.

14:35.407 --> 14:37.409
MAYBE HE'S GOT
A TASER IN HIS HANDS.

14:37.409 --> 14:40.212
HIS HANDS ARE EMPTY.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.814
OKAY, LOOK, IT'S DISTORTED.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.816
MAYBE THERE'S A...

14:43.816 --> 14:45.818
AN ELECTRICAL
GLITCH IN THE CAMERA.

14:45.818 --> 14:47.820
AND HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE
OTHER GUY PICKING UP A MARBLE

14:47.820 --> 14:50.623
AUTOPSY TABLE
WITH HIS BARE HANDS?

14:50.623 --> 14:53.025
NOW THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

14:53.025 --> 14:57.029
IF HE WAS STILL AROUND, I
WOULDN'T MIND ASKING HIM MYSELF.

15:01.433 --> 15:05.037
ONE OF THE PEOPLE
ON THE MORGUE TAPE CAME
UP IN THE VISUAL DATABASE.

15:05.037 --> 15:07.039
"ADAM KANE AND GENOMEX...

15:07.039 --> 15:10.242
TRANSFORMING THE
WORLD, A GENE AT A TIME."

15:10.242 --> 15:14.647
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU PEOPLE UP TO?

15:15.447 --> 15:17.049
YEAH. THIS IS CARLA.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.651
CAN YOU GET ME THE NAMES
OF ANYONE IN THE RECORDS WITH A

15:18.651 --> 15:20.653
CONNECTION TO DENNIS
MALONE AND GENOMEX?

15:21.053 --> 15:22.254
THANKS.

15:29.461 --> 15:31.463
...WHICH IS EXPECTED
EARLY NEXT YEAR.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.465
I'M RECEIVING WORD
OF A BREAKING STORY.

15:33.866 --> 15:35.467
I'M GOING TO PASS
YOU OFF TO CARLA...

15:35.868 --> 15:37.870
LEO, WHERE ARE YOU?

15:38.270 --> 15:40.272
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:40.272 --> 15:41.874
YOU'RE MAKING A MESS.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.876
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

15:43.876 --> 15:45.477
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT?

15:45.477 --> 15:47.479
I GOTTA CLEAN
ALL THIS UP TOMORROW.

15:47.479 --> 15:49.481
THERE IS NO TOMORROW.

15:54.286 --> 15:58.290
STILL UNKNOWN ARE THE IDENTITIES
OF THE MAN WHO APPEARED TO

15:58.290 --> 16:00.292
BE NOLAN'S TARGET AT THE MORGUE,

16:00.693 --> 16:03.095
AND THE FOUR PEOPLE WHO
ATTEMPTED TO CAPTURE NOLAN.

16:03.495 --> 16:04.697
GREAT.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.099
WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST WEAR MUTANT X T-SHIRTS.

16:07.499 --> 16:08.701
AW, COME ON, ADAM.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.302
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

16:10.302 --> 16:11.904
JUST LET HIM TAKE
OUT YOUR FRIEND MARK,

16:11.904 --> 16:13.505
OR WALK AWAY AND
TAKE SOMEONE ELSE OUT?

16:13.505 --> 16:14.707
I KNOW.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.709
BUT WE GOTTA SHUT THIS
THING DOWN WITHOUT ANYBODY ELSE

16:16.709 --> 16:18.711
GETTING HURT, AND PREFERABLY
DO IT WITHOUT GETTING OURSELVES

16:18.711 --> 16:21.513
THE EXPOSURE
ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.

16:21.914 --> 16:25.517
WHATCHA DOING?

16:25.517 --> 16:30.322
WELL, IF WHATEVER OR WHOEVER
WAS IN THAT LIMO DRIVER,

16:30.322 --> 16:32.324
JUMPED TO ANOTHER
PERSON IN THE CROWD,

16:32.324 --> 16:35.928
MAYBE THIS NEWSCAST
WILL GIVE US A CLUE.

16:39.131 --> 16:41.934
RUN IT FROM THERE.

16:41.934 --> 16:43.135
ALL RIGHT, LOOK AT THAT.

16:43.535 --> 16:45.137
THAT'S IT.

16:45.137 --> 16:46.739
THAT'S THE TOUCH OFF.

16:47.139 --> 16:48.340
ANY IDEA WHO SHE IS?

16:48.340 --> 16:49.541
NO.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.944
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE
SHE'S A FRIEND OF MALONE'S.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.946
MAYBE A COWORKER.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.547
MIGHT BE WORTH RUNNING
IT PAST MARK KEARNEY.

16:55.547 --> 16:56.749
YEAH?

16:56.749 --> 16:59.151
WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW
COOPERATIVE HE'S GOING TO BE.

16:59.151 --> 17:01.553
WELL, UNLESS I MISREAD
THAT LOOK HE GAVE ME EARLIER,

17:01.553 --> 17:03.555
I THINK HE'LL
BE PLENTY COOPERATIVE.

17:03.956 --> 17:04.757
ALL RIGHT.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.358
I KNOW WHERE HIS CLINIC IS.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.960
I'LL DROP YOU OFF.

17:07.960 --> 17:11.563
MAYBE YOU MIGHT BE MORE
SUCCESSFUL IF YOU WENT IN ALONE.

17:11.563 --> 17:14.767
SO IS THIS PICTURE
ALL THAT YOU'RE PLANNING
ON RUNNING PAST HIM?

17:14.767 --> 17:17.169
STOP IT.

17:29.982 --> 17:34.386
YOU REALLY DO HAVE A
WAY WITH THE LADIES, DON'T YOU?

17:34.386 --> 17:37.589
AS THE LADY, YOU'RE
BETTER QUALIFIED TO TELL ME.

17:37.589 --> 17:39.591
YOU HAVE A WAY.

17:39.992 --> 17:42.394
TELL ME YOU'RE
NOT HERE AS A PATIENT.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.396
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO TREAT ME?

17:44.396 --> 17:46.398
IF YOU WERE A PATIENT,

17:46.398 --> 17:48.801
THE CODE OF ETHICS MIGHT
GET IN THE WAY OF DINNER.

17:49.201 --> 17:51.603
WELL, I'M NOT A PATIENT.

17:52.004 --> 17:54.807
YOU'RE HERE
ABOUT DENNIS MALONE...

17:54.807 --> 17:59.611
ACTUALLY, I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU RECOGNIZE THIS WOMAN.

17:59.611 --> 18:02.014
NO. I'VE NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE.

18:02.014 --> 18:04.016
WHY?

18:04.416 --> 18:07.619
WELL, WE THINK WHOEVER KILLED
MALONE WAS ONLY USING THE BODY

18:07.619 --> 18:10.022
OF THE LIMO DRIVER.

18:10.022 --> 18:13.625
AND WE THINK THAT HE MIGHT'VE
JUMPED INTO THE BODY OF

18:13.625 --> 18:16.428
SOMEONE ELSE IN THE CROWD
AT THE MORGUE, MAYBE THIS WOMAN.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.831
<LAUGHING> I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.833
IT'S ALL SCIENCE FICTION.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.835
YOU WORKED ON
THE WALKER PROJECT.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.839
I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
BODY TRANSFERS OR MURDERS.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.841
LOOK, MARK, IF YOU DO
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS,

18:28.841 --> 18:30.843
AND THAT PERSON IS STILL
OUT THERE IN ANOTHER BODY,

18:30.843 --> 18:32.044
YOU'RE IN REAL DANGER.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.446
I'VE GOT TO GET
BACK TO MY PATIENTS.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.849
I HOPE I SEE YOU AGAIN.

18:41.253 --> 18:42.855
ANY LUCK?

18:42.855 --> 18:44.456
WELL, IN DINNER
INVITATIONS, YES.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.458
INFORMATION ON
THE WALKER PROJECT, NO.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.060
DR. KANE, CARLA REED, WXTY NEWS.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.661
I'M SORRY. I
JUST DON'T HAVE TIME.

18:49.661 --> 18:51.663
WERE YOU HERE
VISITING MARK KEARNEY?

18:51.663 --> 18:53.265
I DON'T KNOW A MARK KEARNEY.

18:53.265 --> 18:54.466
THAT'S NOT WHAT MY SOURCES SAY.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.468
HE WORKED DIRECTLY UNDER YOU
FOR SIX MONTHS BEFORE SWITCHING

18:56.468 --> 18:58.470
OVER TO WORK WITH DENNIS MALONE.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.472
WELL, YOUR SOURCES HAVE
A BETTER MEMORY THAN I DO.

19:00.472 --> 19:01.273
DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT...

19:01.673 --> 19:02.875
EXCUSE ME...

19:02.875 --> 19:04.076
...ON THE RUMOURS THAT THE
RESEARCH DONE AT GENOMEX MIGHT

19:04.076 --> 19:07.279
SOMEHOW BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR DR. MALONE'S DEATH?

19:07.679 --> 19:09.281
WHAT ABOUT THE RUMOURS THAT
THIS RESEARCH MIGHT HAVE CREATED

19:09.681 --> 19:11.683
PEOPLE WITH SUPERHUMAN
ABILITIES AND POWERS?

19:11.683 --> 19:12.885
RUMOURS?

19:12.885 --> 19:14.486
LOOK, IN SCIENCE,
WE DON'T WORK FROM RUMOURS.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.088
I HOPE THE NEWS
WORKS THE SAME WAY.

19:16.088 --> 19:17.689
DR. KANE, THIS
IS NOT GOING AWAY.

19:17.689 --> 19:20.092
THANK YOU.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.100
GOT IT.
-DAMN.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.701
I GOT THE PLATE.

19:39.244 --> 19:40.846
OH, HEY.

19:40.846 --> 19:44.850
SO DID YOU GET
ANY MORE INFO FROM MARK
ABOUT THE WALKER PROJECT?

19:44.850 --> 19:49.254
NO, I... I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S
IN DENIAL OR IF HE'S JUST SCARED

19:49.254 --> 19:51.657
OR WHAT, BUT HE'S NOT TALKING.

19:51.657 --> 19:53.258
YEAH, WELL, I WOULDN'T
HAVE GIVEN HIM A CHOICE.

19:53.659 --> 19:56.061
A REAL TOUGH GUY, AREN'T YOU?

19:56.061 --> 19:58.063
YEAH. YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE
HIS HANDS LOOK CLEAN,

19:58.063 --> 20:02.067
DOESN'T MEAN HE'S
INNOCENT. REMEMBER THAT.

20:11.276 --> 20:13.278
HEY. I THINK WE GOT A BREAK.

20:13.278 --> 20:15.280
THE POLICE HAVE IDENTIFIED
THE WOMAN WHO THE KILLER

20:15.280 --> 20:16.882
SHIFTED INTO -- KELLY TRAVIS.

20:17.282 --> 20:19.284
SHE DISAPPEARED
FROM THE GROUP SHE WAS WITH
AND HASN'T BEEN SEEN SINCE.

20:19.284 --> 20:20.886
WELL, WE NEED
MORE THAN A NAME, JESS.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.487
WELL, GIVE ME A LITTLE CREDIT.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.089
SHE CHECKED INTO A CHEAP
HOTEL USING HER CREDIT CARD A

20:24.489 --> 20:25.691
COUPLE OF HOURS AGO.

20:25.691 --> 20:27.693
I'M GONNA GET SHALIMAR,
AND WE'LL CHECK IT OUT.

20:27.693 --> 20:29.695
NO. NO... NO,
WE'LL GO WITHOUT HER.

21:06.131 --> 21:07.733
IS THIS THE
MCALLISTER RESIDENCE?

21:07.733 --> 21:09.735
YES, IT IS.

21:09.735 --> 21:11.336
I WANT TO TALK TO LEO.

21:11.336 --> 21:12.537
HE'S NOT HERE.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.940
HE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANY MORE.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.342
IN A RECENT DEVELOPMENT IN THE
INVESTIGATION OF THE DEATH OF

21:17.342 --> 21:20.145
DENNIS MALONE, WXTY NEWS
HAS LEARNED OF A POSSIBLE LINK

21:20.145 --> 21:22.948
BETWEEN SECRET RESEARCH PROJECTS
AT THE NOW-DEFUNCT GENOMEX

21:22.948 --> 21:26.151
CORPORATION AND A
STRING OF SUSPICIOUS DEATHS.

21:26.551 --> 21:28.954
WE'VE LEARNED OF
MORE POTENTIAL VICTIMS.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.757
STAY TUNED TO WXTY...

21:49.374 --> 21:50.976
AGH...!

22:00.986 --> 22:02.187
YOU CAN SEE ME?

22:02.187 --> 22:03.388
YEAH.

22:03.388 --> 22:04.589
THEN STOP FOLLOWING ME.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.191
YOU'RE KILLING PEOPLE.

22:06.191 --> 22:07.793
THEY HAVE TO
PAY FOR WHAT THEY DID.

22:08.193 --> 22:10.195
WHY? WHAT DID THEY DO?

22:10.195 --> 22:11.797
TELL ME.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.434
<SIGH>

22:57.042 --> 22:58.643
HELLO ADAM.

22:58.643 --> 23:00.645
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T EXPECT
ME TO SHOW UP IN THAT DREADFUL

23:00.645 --> 23:03.048
PLACE WITH MY ALLERGIES.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.450
THE WALKER PROJECT WAS
COMMISSIONED BY THE MILITARY TO

23:05.450 --> 23:08.253
MODIFY A HUMAN
SUBJECT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE
OVER THE BODY OF ANOTHER.

23:08.253 --> 23:11.456
IN ESSENCE, GIVING THEM THE
ULTIMATE ABILITY TO INFILTRATE

23:11.456 --> 23:14.259
VIRTUALLY ANY FORCE,
GOVERNMENT OR OTHERWISE.

23:14.259 --> 23:17.462
CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITIES.

23:17.863 --> 23:20.665
THE RIGHT PERSON CAN TAKE OVER
THE WIFE OF A PRIME MINISTER,

23:20.665 --> 23:26.271
THE CHILD OF A POLITICAL
RIVAL OR THE PRESIDENT'S
RIGHT HAND MAN.

23:28.273 --> 23:30.675
THEY'VE CREATED
THE PERFECT ASSASSIN.

23:41.887 --> 23:45.090
YOU INVITED
ME TO DINNER SOMETIME.

23:45.490 --> 23:47.492
I DECIDED TO TAKE YOU UP ON IT.

23:54.299 --> 23:56.301
CAN I TAKE YOUR JACKET?

23:56.301 --> 23:57.502
THANKS.

23:57.502 --> 23:59.104
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME WINE?

23:59.104 --> 24:01.907
YES.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.112
SHALIMAR, IF YOU'RE
HERE TO TALK ABOUT GENOMEX,

24:07.112 --> 24:09.114
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

24:09.514 --> 24:11.116
I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M HERE.

24:11.516 --> 24:13.518
MAYBE IT'S ABOUT THE MURDERER.

24:13.518 --> 24:18.323
MAYBE I JUST THINK
YOU NEED PROTECTION.

24:18.323 --> 24:21.126
WELL, WHEN YOU
LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT I FEEL
LIKE I MIGHT NEED PROTECTION.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.128
WELL, YOU DON'T LOOK TOO SCARED.

24:23.128 --> 24:25.530
I'M MORE FRIGHTENED
BY THE MINUTE.

24:25.530 --> 24:29.534
ME, TOO.

24:29.935 --> 24:32.337
NICE DIGS.

24:32.337 --> 24:35.140
I GUESS I SHOULD'VE EXPECTED
ONE OF THE PRINCES OF GENOMEX

24:35.140 --> 24:37.542
TO LIVE LIKE THIS.

24:37.542 --> 24:40.745
I HAVE THE HOUSE,
BUT THAT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE.

24:40.745 --> 24:43.548
ANOTHER LIFE.

24:43.548 --> 24:47.552
DOES THAT ACCOUNT FOR YOUR
JOB AT THE FREE CLINIC, TOO?

24:47.552 --> 24:50.755
KIND OF SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE TRYING
TO MAKE AMENDS FOR SOMETHING.

24:50.755 --> 24:53.158
ARE YOU PLANNING TO
PSYCHOANALYZE ME ALL NIGHT?

24:53.158 --> 24:55.961
I'M JUST TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

24:55.961 --> 24:59.164
I JUST WANT TO HELP.

24:59.164 --> 25:01.166
THERE ARE SOME THINGS,
THAT WHEN THEY'RE DONE,

25:01.166 --> 25:03.168
YOU CAN NEVER GO BACK TO.

25:03.168 --> 25:07.973
YOU CAN ONLY MOVE AHEAD.

25:27.192 --> 25:30.395
NICE RIDE.

25:30.395 --> 25:32.397
I BET IT GOES REAL FAST.

25:32.797 --> 25:34.799
IT GOES AS FAST
AS YOU WANT IT TO.

25:34.799 --> 25:38.003
<LAUGHING> MAYBE
I SHOULD CHECK IT OUT.

25:38.003 --> 25:41.206
THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM
FOR A PASSENGER LIKE YOU.

25:41.606 --> 25:45.210
<CHOKING> SORRY, I DRIVE ALONE.

25:45.210 --> 25:48.413
AH!

25:56.421 --> 25:58.423
I NEED TO SPEAK TO CARLA REED.

25:58.423 --> 26:00.025
AND YOU ARE...?

26:00.025 --> 26:02.027
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

26:02.027 --> 26:04.029
IT IS IF I'M SUPPOSED
TO BELIEVE YOU.

26:04.029 --> 26:05.630
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

26:06.031 --> 26:08.433
BUT I HAVE INFORMATION
FOR YOU ABOUT THE
MURDER OF DENNIS MALONE.

26:08.433 --> 26:11.636
MALONE WAS IN
CHARGE OF A GENOMEX PROJECT,
CALLED THE WALKER PROJECT.

26:11.636 --> 26:14.839
HIS DEATH WAS PAYBACK FOR
THE CRIMES HE COMMITTED AGAINST

26:14.839 --> 26:16.841
ONE OF HIS TEST SUBJECTS.

26:16.841 --> 26:18.043
WHAT CRIMES?

26:18.043 --> 26:20.045
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
ME IF I TOLD YOU.

26:20.445 --> 26:22.447
BUT WHAT YOU SHOULD BELIEVE,
IS THAT THE OTHER SCIENTISTS

26:22.847 --> 26:24.849
INVOLVED ARE ALSO GOING TO DIE.

26:24.849 --> 26:26.051
MARK KEARNEY?

26:26.051 --> 26:27.252
HE'S ONE.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.853
LEO MCALLISTER, AS WELL.

26:28.853 --> 26:30.455
MCALLISTER.

26:30.455 --> 26:32.057
I HAVEN'T HEARD OF HIM.

26:32.057 --> 26:33.258
HE WAS THE SMART ONE.

26:33.658 --> 26:35.260
HE KNEW IT WAS ONLY A
MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE TEST

26:35.660 --> 26:37.262
SUBJECT WENT AFTER HIM.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.863
HE'S HIDDEN HIMSELF PRETTY WELL.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.666
BUT I KNOW YOU
COULD FIND HIM, CARLA.

26:42.067 --> 26:43.668
I KNOW YOU CAN.

26:44.069 --> 26:45.670
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?

26:45.670 --> 26:47.272
BECAUSE IF YOU
DON'T FIND HIM, I WILL.

26:47.672 --> 26:49.274
AND WHEN I DO, HE'S GONNA DIE.

26:49.274 --> 26:52.477
WHOEVER YOU ARE,
YOU'RE NOT THE KILLER

26:52.477 --> 26:54.479
-- THE PERSON WHO KILLED
DENNIS MALONE WAS A MAN.

26:54.479 --> 27:00.885
CARLA, BABY, I GUARANTEE,
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I AM.

27:04.489 --> 27:06.091
WELL, BRENNAN HIT
HER WITH A SOLID BLAST,

27:06.091 --> 27:08.893
BUT SHE JUST SHOOK IT OFF.

27:08.893 --> 27:10.895
BECAUSE WHO'S EVER
RUNNING THIS BODY DOESN'T
CARE ABOUT PRESERVING IT.

27:10.895 --> 27:12.897
I MEAN, IT'LL TAKE
ANYTHING WE CAN DISH OUT,

27:12.897 --> 27:14.099
AND THEN JUST
JUMP INTO ANOTHER BODY.

27:14.499 --> 27:15.700
HOW THE HELL
DO YOU STOP A GHOST?

27:16.101 --> 27:17.702
WELL, THAT'S WHAT HE IS.

27:17.702 --> 27:19.704
I MEAN, THAT'S
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO ME.

27:19.704 --> 27:21.306
WHEN I HIT HIM
WITH THE PSIONIC BLAST,

27:21.306 --> 27:23.308
WHOEVER IT WAS ALMOST
LEFT THE BODY AGAIN.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.111
AND THEN ALL I FELT
WAS THIS OVERPOWERING SADNESS,

27:26.111 --> 27:28.513
YOU KNOW, LIKE A...

27:28.513 --> 27:30.915
GHOST, WHO ENVIED ALL
OF US THAT WERE STILL LIVING.

27:30.915 --> 27:32.917
WELL, BEFORE WE START
FEELING TOO SORRY FOR IT,

27:32.917 --> 27:34.919
LET'S JUST REMEMBER THAT
THIS GUY'S ON A KILLING SPREE.

27:34.919 --> 27:36.121
I KNOW.

27:36.121 --> 27:38.123
I STILL THINK THAT THIS...

27:38.123 --> 27:40.925
GHOST HAS ITS ROOTS
IN GENOMEX RESEARCH, RIGHT?

27:40.925 --> 27:45.330
I THINK MAYBE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE
GOING TO FIND A WAY TO STOP IT.

27:47.332 --> 27:50.135
WORLD-CLASS SCIENTISTS
DON'T JUST VANISH INTO THIN AIR.

27:50.135 --> 27:52.937
SOMEBODY'S GOTTA KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT MCALLISTER...

27:52.937 --> 27:56.141
HUH, CLASSIFIED INFORMATION?

27:56.141 --> 27:58.943
SINCE WHEN DOES THAT
ACTUALLY MEAN ANYTHING?

27:58.943 --> 28:01.346
I MEAN, YOU'RE THE SAME GUY
WHO SLIPPED ME THE GOVERNOR'S

28:01.346 --> 28:03.348
NETWORK PASSWORD.

28:03.748 --> 28:06.151
<SIGH> LOOK, WE'RE ALL SCARED.

28:06.151 --> 28:08.153
I... I WAS THERE, I SAW
WHAT THE GUY DID TO MALONE.

28:08.153 --> 28:14.559
BILLY, I PROMISE YOU, NOBODY
WILL KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM.

28:14.559 --> 28:18.563
JUST GET ME WHATEVER
YOU CAN ON MCALLISTER.

28:18.563 --> 28:20.965
LOVE YA.

28:22.967 --> 28:24.969
LISTEN TO THIS.

28:24.969 --> 28:28.573
DEAD GUY, MALONE, AND THE
OTHER GENOMEX GUY, MARK KEARNEY,

28:28.973 --> 28:31.776
HAD A THIRD PARTNER ON SOME TOP
SECRET PROJECT THEY WERE DOING.

28:32.177 --> 28:34.579
BLEW UP IN THEIR FACES,
AND THEY ALL LEFT GENOMEX.

28:34.979 --> 28:38.183
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T SEE
MUCH OF A STORY IN THE GUY'S

28:38.183 --> 28:40.185
UNEMPLOYMENT RECORD.

28:40.185 --> 28:42.587
IT'S A STORY WHEN TWO OF THE
TOP RESEARCHERS IN THE WORLD,

28:42.587 --> 28:44.589
LEAVE THE BUSINESS ALTOGETHER.

28:44.989 --> 28:48.593
AND NOW THIS
MCALLISTER'S JUST DROPPED
OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

28:48.993 --> 28:51.796
BUT DON'T TELL ME
-- YOU'RE GONNA FIND HIM.

28:51.796 --> 28:54.599
WELL, ACTUALLY...

28:54.599 --> 28:57.402
WE'RE GOING TO FIND HIM.

28:57.402 --> 28:58.603
AH.

28:58.603 --> 29:00.605
EVEN IF WE HAVE
TO BE HERE ALL NIGHT.

29:01.005 --> 29:04.209
GREAT.

29:04.209 --> 29:07.412
OKAY, WELL,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

29:07.412 --> 29:11.416
I'LL CALL DONNA, TELL HER
TO PUT MY DINNER IN THE FRIDGE.

29:19.023 --> 29:21.426
CAN I HELP YOU?

29:21.426 --> 29:24.229
I HOPE SO.

29:24.629 --> 29:29.033
YEAH, I WAS JUST...

29:29.033 --> 29:36.241
JUST GONNA CALL MY WIFE
AND TELL HER I'M HOME LATE.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.027
OKAY, SO THE FORCE THAT
KILLED MALONE HAS GOT TO BE THE

29:56.027 --> 29:59.230
ASTRAL ASSASSIN THAT
THE WALKER PROJECT CREATED.

29:59.230 --> 30:01.232
OH, WE STOPPED
HIM FROM GETTING TO MARK.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.234
HOPEFULLY WE CAN
STOP HIM IF HE TRIES AGAIN.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.236
YEAH, BUT WE CAN'T
COVER HIM FOREVER.

30:05.236 --> 30:06.838
I MEAN, HOW LONG CAN YOU
KEEP SOMEONE WITH HIS POWER FROM

30:06.838 --> 30:08.039
GETTING TO HIM?

30:08.039 --> 30:09.240
RIGHT.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.842
AND THE OTHER
ISSUE'S, LEO MCALLISTER.

30:10.842 --> 30:12.844
NOW, YEAH, HE'S
DROPPED OUT OF SIGHT,

30:12.844 --> 30:14.846
BUT YOU CAN BET THAT THE
KILLER'S TRYING TO FIND HIM TOO.

30:14.846 --> 30:16.447
DO WE HAVE ANY LEADS?

30:16.447 --> 30:17.649
WELL NO, UNFORTUNATELY,

30:17.649 --> 30:19.651
OUR BEST SOURCES ARE
MARK KEARNEY AND CARLA REED.

30:19.651 --> 30:20.852
THAT REPORTER?

30:20.852 --> 30:22.453
YOU'RE NOT SAYING
WE SHOULD TALK TO HER.

30:22.854 --> 30:24.055
SHE'S ALREADY ALL OVER US.

30:24.055 --> 30:25.657
NO, BUT WHAT I'M SAYING
IS THAT IF SHE FINDS OUT WHERE

30:25.657 --> 30:26.858
MCALLISTER IS, WE'VE
GOTTA KNOW ABOUT IT.

30:27.258 --> 30:28.459
SO I WANT YOU TO SPLIT UP.

30:28.459 --> 30:30.061
I WANT YOU TO COVER BOTH ANGLES.

30:30.061 --> 30:32.063
I'LL COVER THE REPORTER.

30:32.063 --> 30:35.266
I'LL MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T
WIND UP GIVING HER AN EXCLUSIVE.

30:35.266 --> 30:38.069
WELL, I GUESS THAT LEAVES
SHAL AND ME TO COVER DR. MARK.

30:38.069 --> 30:41.272
I GUESS I GET TO SEE
HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVES, HUH?

30:46.477 --> 30:47.679
VIC.

30:47.679 --> 30:50.481
VIC?

30:50.481 --> 30:52.083
FOUND MCALLISTER.

30:52.083 --> 30:53.685
HE'S LIVING IN A
JUNKYARD ON THE WEST SIDE.

30:53.685 --> 30:54.886
READY?

30:54.886 --> 30:56.087
OH, YEAH.

30:56.087 --> 30:58.089
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS.

30:58.089 --> 31:01.693
GREAT. LET'S GO.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.298
HE'S HERE.

31:07.699 --> 31:08.900
THE REPORTER?

31:08.900 --> 31:10.902
I DON'T KNOW.

31:15.707 --> 31:19.310
OH, MY GOD.

31:22.113 --> 31:24.916
THEY KNOW WHERE MCALLISTER IS.

31:24.916 --> 31:28.119
WE'VE GOT TO STOP HIM.

31:37.328 --> 31:39.330
COME ON.

31:40.531 --> 31:42.533
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

31:42.533 --> 31:44.936
PEOPLE WHO DON'T
KNOW WHEN TO GIVE UP.

31:49.340 --> 31:50.541
<SCREAM>

31:57.348 --> 31:59.350
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

31:59.350 --> 32:02.153
LADY, SOMETIMES YOU
JUST GOTTA LEARN TO SHUT UP.

32:02.153 --> 32:04.555
NOW, WHICH WAY IS THIS JUNKYARD?

32:06.958 --> 32:08.960
OH, LET'S SEE WHAT FRESH LIES
YOUR FRIEND MARK HAS TO TELL.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.561
WILL YOU STOP IT?

32:10.561 --> 32:12.163
HE'S NOT LIKE THAT.

32:12.163 --> 32:13.765
YOU'VE TOTALLY LOST
PERSPECTIVE HERE, HAVEN'T YOU?

32:13.765 --> 32:15.366
OH, I'VE LOST PERSPECTIVE?

32:15.366 --> 32:16.567
YEAH.

32:16.567 --> 32:18.169
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
HATES HIM FOR NO REASON,

32:18.169 --> 32:19.771
EXCEPT FOR MAYBE THE
FACT THAT I MIGHT LIKE HIM.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.773
IN CASE YOU'RE FORGETTING,
MR. CLEAN IS GENOMEX, THE ENEMY.

32:22.173 --> 32:25.376
ONE OF THE ONES
RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THE
ASSASSIN IN THE FIRST PLACE.

32:25.376 --> 32:28.579
YEAH, WELL, I'D LIKE
TO HEAR THAT FROM HIM.

32:28.579 --> 32:32.183
YEAH, I'LL BET.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.189
NICE SURPRISE.

32:38.189 --> 32:40.191
BUT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING.

32:40.191 --> 32:42.593
OH, NO THIS IS ABOUT YOUR
WORK, YOU KNOW, YOUR REAL WORK?

32:42.593 --> 32:44.195
THE WALKER PROJECT.

32:44.595 --> 32:46.597
YEAH, YOU REMEMBER, THE...

32:46.597 --> 32:49.801
THE ASSASSIN THAT
YOU CREATED FOR GENOMEX?

32:49.801 --> 32:52.203
I SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS
TRYING TO FORGET THOSE TIMES.

32:52.203 --> 32:55.006
OH, THERE'S SOMEBODY
WHO HASN'T FORGOTTEN AND
THAT'S WHO KILLED MALONE.

32:55.006 --> 32:59.811
AND YOU'VE KNOWN
ABOUT IT ALL ALONG.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.412
I HAVE PATIENTS.

33:01.412 --> 33:03.815
LOOK, MARK, YOU KNOW
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

33:03.815 --> 33:05.416
UNTIL HE COMES AFTER YOU.

33:05.416 --> 33:09.821
<SIGH> IN A WAY, I SUPPOSE,

33:09.821 --> 33:13.424
I'VE BEEN READY FOR THAT
SINCE THE DAY I LEFT GENOMEX.

33:13.825 --> 33:17.829
<SIGH> IT'S OKAY.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.831
IT'S NOT OKAY.

33:19.831 --> 33:23.835
WE TOOK A SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD
KID, AND WE STOLE HIS SOUL.

33:23.835 --> 33:28.239
HIS NAME WAS CYRUS PAYTON.

33:28.239 --> 33:34.245
HE USED TO HANG AROUND,
WAITING FOR HIS TREATMENTS,

33:34.245 --> 33:36.247
READING COMICS
AND EATING JUNK FOOD.

33:36.647 --> 33:41.052
EXCEPT FOR HIS ASTRAL
PROJECTION POWERS, NORMAL KID.

33:41.052 --> 33:44.655
AND THEN MALONE FIGURED
OUT A WAY FOR HIM TO SHIFT INTO

33:44.655 --> 33:47.058
OTHER PEOPLE'S BODIES.

33:47.058 --> 33:49.460
AND THEN HE FOUND HE
COULDN'T GET BACK TO HIS OWN.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.462
WHAT?

33:51.462 --> 33:53.865
HE SHIFTED FOR TOO LONG.

33:53.865 --> 33:57.068
AND WHEN HE TRIED TO
GET BACK, THE BODY HAD DIED.

33:57.068 --> 34:00.271
THE POOR KID WAS STUCK,
SHIFTING FROM BODY TO BODY,

34:00.271 --> 34:02.673
NEVER ABLE TO STAY ANYWHERE,
BECAUSE HE'D BURN 'EM OUT.

34:02.673 --> 34:05.076
YOU TRIED TO HELP HIM, RIGHT?

34:05.476 --> 34:09.480
AT GENOMEX, THERE WAS ONLY
ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH MISTAKES.

34:09.480 --> 34:12.283
INSTEAD OF TRYING
TO FIND HIM A STABLE BODY,

34:12.283 --> 34:14.685
MALONE CREATED
A CONTAINMENT FIELD, A...

34:14.685 --> 34:17.088
AN ELECTRICAL
VERSION OF THE PODS.

34:17.088 --> 34:19.090
OH, SO SOMETHING JUST HAPPENED
TO THE CONTAINMENT FIELD,

34:19.090 --> 34:20.690
AND HE JUST
GOT FREE, IS THAT IT?

34:21.092 --> 34:25.096
I GUESS SO.

34:26.297 --> 34:27.098
BRENNAN?

34:27.098 --> 34:28.699
YEAH.

34:28.699 --> 34:30.701
THE KILLER'S TAKEN
OVER CARLA REED'S CAMERAMAN.

34:30.701 --> 34:33.103
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY
OVER TO GET LEO MCALLISTER.

34:33.103 --> 34:34.705
WE LOST THEM.

34:35.106 --> 34:37.108
HEY, YOU MAY BE READY
FOR WHATEVER HAPPENS TO YOU,

34:37.108 --> 34:39.510
BUT CYRUS PAYTON IS ON HIS WAY
TO SEE YOUR FRIEND MCALLISTER.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.112
YOU NEED TO TELL US WHERE
HE IS, OR YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

34:41.112 --> 34:43.514
ANOTHER DEATH
ON YOUR CONSCIENCE.

34:43.514 --> 34:45.516
HE LIVES IN A JUNKYARD
ON THE WEST SIDE.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.518
ON MAPLE AT INDUSTRY.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.120
DID YOU GET THAT?

34:49.120 --> 34:52.322
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

35:07.538 --> 35:09.540
WHO ARE YOU?

35:09.540 --> 35:13.144
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

35:13.144 --> 35:15.146
COME ON, THIS IS YOUR BIG STORY.

35:15.146 --> 35:17.548
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

35:17.548 --> 35:20.351
ASK THE QUESTIONS.

35:20.751 --> 35:23.955
I'M...

35:23.955 --> 35:27.959
CARLA REED FROM WXTY NEWS.

35:27.959 --> 35:30.361
I DON'T SPEAK TO REPORTERS.

35:30.361 --> 35:32.363
YEAH, YOU'LL SPEAK TO US.

35:32.363 --> 35:34.365
GO ON.

35:34.765 --> 35:38.769
WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT
YOUR WORK WITH GENOMEX.

35:39.170 --> 35:41.973
THE WALKER PROJECT?

35:42.373 --> 35:45.576
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

35:45.576 --> 35:47.578
OKAY, YOU SEE, YOU'RE
DOING THIS ALL WRONG.

35:47.578 --> 35:49.580
I'LL TAKE OVER.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.383
PROFESSOR MCALLISTER, WHY
DON'T YOU TELL US WHY A BUNCH OF

35:52.383 --> 35:56.787
SCIENTISTS TOOK AN INNOCENT
KID, TOLD HIM YOU WERE GOING TO

35:57.188 --> 35:59.190
HELP HIM LEARN HOW TO USE
HIS SPECIAL POWERS, AND THEN YOU

35:59.190 --> 36:02.793
TRICKED HIM INTO THIS
PROCEDURE THAT WOULD KILL HIM?

36:02.793 --> 36:04.395
NO, IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

36:04.395 --> 36:06.397
OH, OH, YEAH.

36:06.397 --> 36:08.399
YEAH, IT WAS, DOC.

36:08.399 --> 36:11.602
I WAS THERE.

36:11.602 --> 36:16.807
CYRUS...?

36:31.622 --> 36:32.823
CYRUS.

36:32.823 --> 36:34.425
HEY, WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

36:34.425 --> 36:35.626
WE CAN HELP YOU.

36:35.626 --> 36:37.628
THERE'S STILL A FEW
THINGS I GOTTA DO BEFORE I GO.

36:37.628 --> 36:39.230
OH, OH, PLEASE.

36:39.230 --> 36:40.831
EMMA?

36:41.232 --> 36:42.833
OH, NO, NOT THIS TIME.

36:42.833 --> 36:44.435
CYRUS, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

36:44.835 --> 36:45.636
YEAH?

36:45.636 --> 36:47.238
WELL, THEN YOU
KNOW WHAT I GOTTA DO.

36:47.238 --> 36:48.439
OH.

36:48.439 --> 36:49.240
OPEN THE DOOR!

36:49.640 --> 36:50.841
STAY BACK!

36:50.841 --> 36:54.845
YEAH, GET IN.

36:54.845 --> 36:57.648
SEE YOU LATER.

37:12.063 --> 37:14.465
OKAY, THEY LOST HIM, WHICH MEANS
YOU'RE NEXT ON THE HIT PARADE.

37:14.865 --> 37:17.268
I SENT
THE STAFF HOME, AND CANCELLED
THE DAY'S APPOINTMENTS.

37:17.268 --> 37:19.270
I DON'T WANT ANYONE
ELSE GETTING HURT.

37:19.270 --> 37:21.672
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE
NOT PLANNING ON STAYING
AROUND YOURSELF, ARE YOU?

37:21.672 --> 37:23.274
WELL, WHAT ELSE
AM I GOING TO DO?

37:23.274 --> 37:25.276
EVEN IF I HIDE OUT
FROM HIM A LITTLE LONGER,

37:25.276 --> 37:27.678
HOW MANY MORE BODIES WILL
HE GO THROUGH TO GET TO ME?

37:27.678 --> 37:29.680
YOUR FRIEND HERE WAS RIGHT.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.682
I'VE GOT ENOUGH
BODIES ON MY CONSCIENCE.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.085
I CAN'T AFFORD ANY MORE.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.087
WELL, MAYBE NOBODY HAS TO DIE.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.089
YOU SAID THERE
WAS A WAY TO CONTAIN HIM.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.091
IT WAS A FLUKE.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.493
IT... HIS ASTRAL BODY
IS AN ELECTRICAL PATTERN.

37:42.493 --> 37:44.895
IF HE'S BETWEEN BODIES,

37:44.895 --> 37:46.497
HE'S VULNERABLE
TO AN ELECTRICAL ATTACK.

37:46.897 --> 37:48.899
BUT WHEN HE'S IN A BODY,
HE'S IMPERVIOUS TO ANYTHING.

37:48.899 --> 37:50.501
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

37:50.501 --> 37:52.103
WELL, IF WE CAN
GET HIM OUT OF THAT BODY,

37:52.103 --> 37:53.704
THEN I'M ALL OVER
THAT ELECTRICAL ATTACK.

37:53.704 --> 37:55.706
NOW, HE KNOWS WHAT
WE DID TO HIM BEFORE.

37:55.706 --> 37:57.308
HE'LL ONLY SWAP
WHEN HE KNOWS IT'S SAFE.

37:57.308 --> 37:59.310
YEAH, WELL, I DIDN'T
SAY IT WAS GOING TO BE EASY.

37:59.310 --> 38:02.113
YOU NEED BAIT TO BRING HIM IN.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.115
I'M WHAT HE'S AFTER.

38:04.115 --> 38:09.320
NO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

38:09.320 --> 38:12.523
I'LL BE OKAY.

38:12.523 --> 38:15.326
GOOD.

38:25.736 --> 38:27.738
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

38:27.738 --> 38:30.141
HAVE YOU GONE COMPLETELY INSANE?

38:30.141 --> 38:32.943
YEAH, YOU DON'T
KNOW THE HALF OF IT.

38:32.943 --> 38:34.545
WELL... WHEN THIS
IS OVER, YOU'RE FIRED.

38:34.945 --> 38:36.547
YOU WILL NEVER SHOOT
TAPE IN THIS TOWN AGAIN.

38:36.947 --> 38:38.549
YEAH, YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

38:38.549 --> 38:40.151
LET GO. YOU'RE HURTING ME.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.153
SORRY, BUT I NEED A RECHARGE.

38:42.553 --> 38:44.155
YOU WANT THIS STORY SO MUCH?

38:44.155 --> 38:47.758
I'M GOING TO
LET YOU BE PART OF IT.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.973
HELLO, CYRUS.

39:08.179 --> 39:11.782
THEY CAN'T STOP ME. NOTHING CAN.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.585
THAT'S HOW YOU MADE ME.

39:14.985 --> 39:16.187
I KNOW.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.788
CYRUS, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.390
NO, YOU DON'T.

39:19.390 --> 39:20.991
YES, I DO, BELIEVE ME.

39:20.991 --> 39:22.193
I FEEL IT.

39:22.593 --> 39:25.396
BUT KILLING THESE PEOPLE
ISN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING.

39:25.396 --> 39:28.199
YES, IT WILL. IT'LL FINISH IT.

39:28.599 --> 39:32.203
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I'M SORRY.

39:32.203 --> 39:35.406
DOESN'T MATTER.

39:35.406 --> 39:37.408
OH, OH....

39:37.408 --> 39:44.215
OH...

39:46.217 --> 39:52.223
NOW JESS!

40:33.063 --> 40:37.468
IT'S OVER.

40:37.868 --> 40:40.271
IS IT?

40:58.689 --> 41:01.492
IT'S WITH GREAT SADNESS THAT
WE REPORT THE PASSING TODAY OF

41:01.492 --> 41:05.095
TWO MEMBERS OF THE WXTY FAMILY,
FEATURE REPORTER CARLA REED

41:05.095 --> 41:09.900
AND CAMERAMAN VIC MORELLI,
KILLED WHILE PURSUING A STORY.

41:10.301 --> 41:15.506
THEY DIED AS THEY LIVED:
FEARLESS SEEKERS OF THE TRUTH.

41:17.508 --> 41:21.512
WELL, IN A WAY,
YEAH, I FEEL GUILTY.

41:21.512 --> 41:23.514
AW, COME ON, ADAM, NOBODY
FORCED HER TO TAKE ON THE STORY.

41:23.914 --> 41:25.516
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

41:25.516 --> 41:27.117
IT WOULD'VE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE
TO KEEP HER OFF OF IT.

41:27.518 --> 41:28.719
AH, I KNOW.

41:28.719 --> 41:30.321
YOU KNOW, IT'S STILL...

41:30.321 --> 41:34.325
IT'S JUST MORE LIVES CHALKED
UP TO THE GENOMEX ACCOUNT.

41:34.325 --> 41:38.329
HOW'S MARK?

41:38.329 --> 41:42.733
WELL, I THINK HE'S
GOING TO NEED SOME TIME.

41:43.133 --> 41:45.936
AND THE TWO OF YOU?

41:45.936 --> 41:48.339
OH, THE LAST THING
HE NEEDS RIGHT NOW,

41:48.339 --> 41:51.542
IS TO BE REMINDED
OF MUTANTS AND GENOMEX.

41:51.542 --> 41:55.145
IT'S KIND OF
ME ALL OVER, ISN'T IT?

41:55.145 --> 41:58.749
HEY, FOR WHAT IT'S
WORTH, I'M SORRY, HUH?

41:58.749 --> 42:01.151
THANKS.
