<i>During your first year,
things begin to feel different.</i>

00:05.923 --> 00:09.051
<i>You've arrived. You know?
You just start to feel...</i>

00:09.134 --> 00:10.552
l'm open.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.722
<i>- ...cooler.
- My God!</i>

00:13.805 --> 00:17.768
- Turk, that was amazing!
- Woman, shush.

00:17.851 --> 00:21.605
lt's a lot cooler
if we don't make a big deal out of it.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.739
Hang on, Ma. lt's him.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.787
<i>- Whatever.
- JD!</i>

00:36.870 --> 00:39.456
<i>The point is,
we've found our stride.</i>

00:39.540 --> 00:41.542
<i>We know all the ins and outs.</i>

00:42.751 --> 00:45.420
Shall we? And...

00:53.846 --> 00:56.557
My God!
Which one of you two did that?

00:56.640 --> 00:58.183
- My bad.
- That was me.

00:58.267 --> 01:01.270
- Both of you?
- Player!

01:01.353 --> 01:05.065
Could we have an agreement?
No enclosed spaces.

01:06.483 --> 01:10.028
- Morning, doctors.
- Morning, sir.

01:10.112 --> 01:13.866
Mrs Winston,
it's back to the home for you.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.662
- Elliot, that is disgusting.
- Seriously.

01:19.955 --> 01:23.208
Sweetheart, consider a change in diet.

01:25.544 --> 01:28.422
Fine. l hate you guys.
l hate you, l hate you.

01:28.505 --> 01:32.259
<i>Let's face it. We've earned
the right to be a little cocky.</i>

01:33.760 --> 01:36.096
- Jerome!
- What up, dawg?

01:36.180 --> 01:38.223
My man!

01:38.307 --> 01:40.225
Who the hell's Jerome?

01:40.309 --> 01:43.562
<i>And I gotta tell you,
nobody can take this feeling away.</i>

01:44.521 --> 01:45.522
<i>Nobody.</i>

01:45.606 --> 01:49.151

<i>After months of doing
everyone else's scut work,</i>

01:54.198 --> 01:57.492
<i>we're finally not the lowest

Look at you three, all excited.

02:01.955 --> 02:06.210
<i>Today we get
our very own med students.</i>

02:09.128 --> 02:11.882
Welcome to Hell.

02:13.425 --> 02:15.928
Gimme some hungry chicken.

02:17.179 --> 02:19.389
Not hungry enough.
Give me some more.

lt's like we're cheetahs
and they're a pack of gazelles.

02:57.803 --> 03:02.266
l want to encourage you all
to think of me as your safety net.

03:02.349 --> 03:06.228
Because l promise you,
we're a family here.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.772
Let's go get 'em, doctors.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.192
They're buying it.

03:12.276 --> 03:15.821
''The Devil's greatest trick was
convincing the world he didn't exist.''

03:15.904 --> 03:16.905
<i>Baby</i>

03:18.615 --> 03:21.785
- You two are dorks.
- l gotta go.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.955
l gotta go meet up with
my med student up in Surgery.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.415
Know who you're getting?

03:26.498 --> 03:29.626
Nope, but it's probably someone black.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.296
<i>- Sugar darlin'
- Girl</i>

03:32.421 --> 03:35.883
So, l want someone
l can be friends with, you know?

03:35.966 --> 03:40.137
l hope l get a jerk. l took
so much crap as a med student

03:40.220 --> 03:43.891
that l've been waiting for the day
l get to make someone suffer.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.476
Listen, nurse.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.562
l'm looking for a Dr Elliot Reid.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.564
l'm Elliot Reid.

03:50.647 --> 03:54.359
Guy's name,
guy's job, guy's clothes...

03:54.443 --> 03:56.737
Anything else you wanna tell me?

03:56.820 --> 03:59.990
Goody! You're a jerk.

04:02.576 --> 04:06.830
Just remember to breathe,
and you'll get through the day.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.083
Josh?
Hi, l'm Dr Dorian.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.253
l know what this looks like, but...

04:13.337 --> 04:15.631
l do that all the time.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.509
Do you ever part
your hair on the wrong side

04:18.591 --> 04:21.803
to see what you look like
to other people?

04:21.887 --> 04:23.138
No.

04:23.222 --> 04:25.807
lt totally messes everyone up.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.810
Do you have any questions?

04:28.894 --> 04:31.104
What's the babe
situation like here?

04:31.188 --> 04:33.315
Easy, tiger.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.656
Have you seen a med student here?

04:40.739 --> 04:43.158
Yeah. Me.

04:43.242 --> 04:46.453
Cool. Nice to meet you, ma'am.

04:46.537 --> 04:50.082
Actually, the only people
that call me ''ma'am'' are nobody.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.876
No. l use ''ma'am'' all the time. Watch.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.671
What up, ma'am?

04:55.754 --> 04:59.466
- See? lt's my thing.
- Yeah, right.

04:59.550 --> 05:01.301
Come on. l'm here to learn.

05:01.385 --> 05:03.428
Listen up, kid.
Lesson number one:

05:03.512 --> 05:05.681
All surgical interns?
They're dogs.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.641
- Not a problem.
- Hey, baby.

05:07.724 --> 05:12.813
This overbearing machismo is usually
just compensation for a lap-pinkie.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.274
That's cold!

05:16.775 --> 05:18.861
What just happened?

05:18.944 --> 05:22.364
Don't worry about it.
lt's all good in the 'hood.

05:23.907 --> 05:28.078
l'll tell you what l expect.
You parted your hair on the other side?

05:28.996 --> 05:32.332
You're gonna do H & Ps,
write admission orders...

05:32.416 --> 05:33.959
What are you doing?

05:34.042 --> 05:36.545
l can't walk and write at the same time.

05:36.628 --> 05:39.673
<i>- lt makes me nauseous.
- A famous doctor once said,</i>

05:39.756 --> 05:43.719
<i>''Show me a med student that only
triples my work and I'll kiss his feet. ''</i>

05:43.802 --> 05:48.473
Philip, l need you to shave his groin
so l can place a femoral triple-lumen.

05:48.557 --> 05:52.436
l'm not so much with
the ''shavin' a guy's curlies''.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.647
lf you get just one
bad evaluation from me,

05:55.731 --> 05:58.692
it'll torch your class rank,
so do what l tell you.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.819
And if l ask you to shave a groin,

06:00.903 --> 06:04.072
thank your lucky stars
that l said ''shave''.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.537
l'll tell you what.

06:10.621 --> 06:13.582
l'll lather you up,
and you think about baseball.

06:14.833 --> 06:17.377
Natural redhead.

06:18.504 --> 06:22.049
l'll need you to change the dressing
on the fem bypass in 402,

06:22.132 --> 06:25.093
and DC the staples
on the gastroplasty in post-op.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.846
l have no idea what you just said.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.850
l'm kidding.

06:31.934 --> 06:35.270
Looks like you won
the med student raffle there, pal.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.900
- lntroduce me.
- Excuse me?

06:39.983 --> 06:43.153
You give me her name
and tell her my name,

06:43.237 --> 06:45.864
or you go her name,
my name, my name, her name.

06:45.948 --> 06:48.784
No. You like Carla.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.787
Do you actually listen
to yourself when you speak,

06:51.870 --> 06:53.997
or do you find you drift in and out?

06:55.249 --> 06:58.293
Fine. Then l'm gonna go ahead

06:58.377 --> 07:02.047
and continue to focus
all my energies on Carla.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.841
Listening, watching...

07:05.259 --> 07:07.135
...waiting.

07:07.803 --> 07:10.472
Dr Cox, Kristen.
Kristen, Dr Cox.

07:13.141 --> 07:17.646
Josh, l asked you
to get this guy's history an hour ago.

07:17.729 --> 07:20.023
lt should've taken five minutes.

07:20.107 --> 07:24.570
We were just talking.
This guy, he is the bomb!

07:24.653 --> 07:26.780
OK. Bye-bye. Moving on.

07:26.864 --> 07:29.616
Help someone else. l'm sorry about that.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.785
Relax, Bambi. Be nice to Thumper.

07:31.869 --> 07:34.329
He wrote ''The guy sweats
when he exercises.''

07:34.413 --> 07:36.248
- l do.
- l'll call Ripley's!

07:36.331 --> 07:38.792
Relax. lt's just one mistake.

07:40.377 --> 07:41.795
Relax, Bambi.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.964
lt's just one mistake.

07:44.173 --> 07:48.760
- Good night, Thumper.
- Cool! Great first day, Dr Dorian.

07:48.844 --> 07:51.597
Yeah, it was.

07:52.389 --> 07:56.226
- Relax. lt's just one mistake.
- Yes! They're each one mistake.

07:56.310 --> 07:59.188
Put 'em all together,
it makes four million.

07:59.271 --> 08:03.066
Did you just snap at me?
Because l think he just snapped at me.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.235
- l'm sorry.
- Yeah, you are.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.362
Carla, l gotta go home.

08:07.446 --> 08:10.073
You have to co-sign all these orders,

08:10.157 --> 08:14.369
fill out a vascular consult on bed three
and get a tox screen for Mrs O'Brien.

08:14.453 --> 08:19.124
- But Josh did all this.
- Honey, l don't think so.

08:37.392 --> 08:40.604
Mrs O'Brien, l'm afraid
l'm gonna need a urine sample.

08:41.813 --> 08:44.983
l hope you're taking
very good care of my hospital.

08:45.067 --> 08:47.152
You're darn tootin'.

08:48.529 --> 08:52.699
Jackass. Dr Reid, say hello
to Whitaker Chambers.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.785
- What up?
- ''What up''?

08:55.702 --> 08:57.996
Whitaker Chambers is the CEO

08:58.080 --> 09:00.791
of the corporation
that owns this hospital,

09:00.874 --> 09:04.920
so l suggest you stop
acting like LL Cool Reid

09:05.003 --> 09:07.798
and start acting like Dr Reid.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.383
You dig?

09:09.466 --> 09:12.511
- Why would he want to meet me?
- Hey, Dad.

09:12.594 --> 09:15.514
Hey, son!

09:15.597 --> 09:17.558
Poopies.

09:18.642 --> 09:23.814
- lt was really nice to meet you.
- Same here, doctor.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.484
l'm sorry. Dr Cox,

09:27.568 --> 09:30.654
l was gonna take Kristen
out for a beer after work.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.282
Would you like to join us?

09:34.700 --> 09:37.953
No. l can't do it.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.122
No!

09:40.205 --> 09:43.000
- ls he OK?
- Not really.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.588
Dr Dorian?

09:51.008 --> 09:54.553
Your roommate let me in.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.805
Cool dead dog. Can l pet him?

09:56.889 --> 09:58.098
<i>Is he kidding?</i>

09:58.182 --> 10:01.768
l came by because l know
l didn't do so great yesterday...

10:01.852 --> 10:04.313
What is it that tipped you off?

10:04.396 --> 10:08.192
Was it your inability to
perform even the simplest task?

10:08.275 --> 10:10.986
l'll bet it was that
l got home 20 minutes ago

10:11.069 --> 10:14.823
because l spent the entire night
cleaning up after you.

10:14.907 --> 10:19.494
l'm sorry.
l was just really scared.

10:19.578 --> 10:22.789
You know what, Josh?
You should be scared.

10:22.873 --> 10:25.626
Because l gotta be honest with you.

10:25.709 --> 10:28.629
l don't think you got what it takes.

10:28.712 --> 10:31.215
Do you?

10:34.718 --> 10:36.803
l didn't think so.

10:40.390 --> 10:44.645
l'm still not gonna feel bad
about what l said to Josh.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.982
You don't scare me, woman.

10:50.359 --> 10:53.070
l'm so sorry. l'll apologise at rounds.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.656
Nurse Roberts, have you seen Josh?

10:55.739 --> 10:58.617
The tall skinny one? He quit.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.953
Nice job, Bambi.

11:01.036 --> 11:04.373
l didn't mean for that to happen.
l didn't.

11:04.456 --> 11:07.000
You don't have to apologise to me.

11:07.084 --> 11:09.628
You will have to answer to Jesus.

11:18.387 --> 11:21.723
<i>After what happened,
I did what any good person would do.</i>

11:21.807 --> 11:25.060
<i>I went looking for confirmation
that it wasn't my fault.</i>

11:25.561 --> 11:27.437
Here's what happened.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.690
He was screwing up constantly.

11:29.773 --> 11:31.483
l didn't force him to quit.

11:32.317 --> 11:35.070
l don't think it's my fault he quit.

11:35.153 --> 11:38.282
Most of the bad things
that happen here are your fault.

11:38.365 --> 11:41.326
- l was talking to her.
- l won't say what you wanna hear.

11:41.410 --> 11:44.830
Nurse Roberts says he's the most
incompetent doctor she's worked with.

11:44.913 --> 11:48.333
Laverne, what'd you say about JD
when he first started working here?

11:48.417 --> 11:51.461
He was the most incompetent
doctor l ever worked with.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.922
- lt's not my fault he failed.
- You failed.

11:54.006 --> 11:56.258
You're supposed to be his teacher.

11:58.677 --> 12:02.556
See, to me that sounds like
it's your fault. l don't know.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.641
Shocker. Yeah.

12:04.725 --> 12:07.811
Where you going? Stay and play!

12:15.485 --> 12:19.489
So you're having trouble
asking out Kristen.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.742
- No problem.
- Whoa, Curly.

12:21.825 --> 12:24.328
l got no problem. Wanna have a drink?

12:24.411 --> 12:26.205
- No.
- See? l'm fine.

12:26.288 --> 12:29.750
You know how men are always
talking about themselves?

12:29.833 --> 12:32.211
Women like to talk
about themselves more.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.755
Thank you.
You've touched me deeply.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.257
You can be cynical,
but l'm telling you,

12:37.341 --> 12:41.553
get Kristen to talk about herself,
it's on. lt's on and poppin'.

12:41.637 --> 12:45.140
- lf that doesn't work, do what l do.
- Which is what?

12:47.392 --> 12:51.855
- Show her the booty!
- No. You put that away.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.690
Think of the children.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.193
Doctor!

12:56.276 --> 13:01.073
Philip, l was wondering if you could
write out this discharge summary.

13:01.156 --> 13:02.908
Where's the fun?

13:02.991 --> 13:04.701
- Excuse me?
- From now on,

13:04.785 --> 13:07.162
when you're wondering whether
l'll do something,

13:07.246 --> 13:09.581
ask yourself, ''Where's the fun?''

13:09.665 --> 13:12.084
lt'll be a timesaver for both of us.

13:12.167 --> 13:15.838
l'm betting that
if you were really honest with yourself,

13:15.921 --> 13:20.717
you'd realise how unsatisfying it is
to ride on your father's coattails.

13:21.510 --> 13:23.762
No, l'm OK with it.

13:29.017 --> 13:32.145
Josh, this is completely crazy.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.523
You told me l shouldn't be a doctor.

13:34.606 --> 13:37.234
Kidding... Josh.

13:37.317 --> 13:41.905
You know what? Forget all of that.
You have to hang in there.

13:41.989 --> 13:44.908
Now, l promise you,
l am gonna help you.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.160
Here we go.

13:48.453 --> 13:51.415
You're doing it.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.584
Yeah, you are!
You're doing it!

13:54.626 --> 13:58.714
- So, what do you say?
- l know what you're trying to do.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.550
My whole life,
people have felt sorry for me.

14:01.633 --> 14:05.137
- Why would anyone feel sorry for you?
- l'm clumsy,

14:05.220 --> 14:08.015
l'm always throwing up,
l don't even have an ass!

14:08.098 --> 14:11.977
Those are the same things l was
dealing with when l started here.

14:12.060 --> 14:15.314
Except for the ass part.
l actually have a great ass.

14:15.397 --> 14:17.774
lt's firm like mutton.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.985
l'm not buying it, Dr Dorian.

14:20.986 --> 14:23.071
But thanks for trying.

14:25.490 --> 14:28.160
- So, where you from?
- Chicago. You?

14:28.243 --> 14:32.080
- Pittsburgh. Family? Brothers, sisters?
- One older brother. You?

14:32.164 --> 14:36.960
We're gonna keep the focus on you.
Are your parents still together?

14:37.044 --> 14:38.545
Yep.

14:38.629 --> 14:41.715
Do you have any idea how hard
you're making this on me?

14:41.798 --> 14:44.760
No, but l wonder if someone
slipped something into my soda.

14:44.843 --> 14:47.804
He has that effect on everyone
the first few weeks.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.601
l gotta go. We'll pick this up later.

14:52.684 --> 14:55.145
Pick what up?

14:58.190 --> 14:59.775
What up, dawg?

14:59.858 --> 15:02.361
Not a strong move
with the tighty-whities.

15:09.993 --> 15:13.121
lf you won't help,
go wait for your trust fund to mature.

15:13.205 --> 15:17.584
- Dr Reid, can l see you a minute?
- Dr Kelso, l am so, so sorry.

15:17.668 --> 15:21.046
l just got so frustrated,
plus l'm PMSing.

15:21.129 --> 15:24.591
Well, the pill plays havoc
with my cycle. l'm like...

15:24.675 --> 15:26.009
Dr Reid?

15:26.093 --> 15:28.220
You talk too much. lt's a problem.

15:28.303 --> 15:30.722
Why are you doing
your med student's work?

15:30.806 --> 15:33.934
- Well, his father...
- l hate his father.

15:34.017 --> 15:37.104
But l'm the one who has
to suck up to him, not you.

15:37.187 --> 15:41.066
<i>For God's sake, woman,
show some cojones!</i>

15:46.613 --> 15:50.117
<i>It's hard trying to figure out
how to reach somebody.</i>

15:50.200 --> 15:52.911
<i>The thing is to think
of someone I look up to,</i>

15:52.995 --> 15:55.289
<i>and remember
how they got through to me.</i>

15:55.372 --> 15:57.875
The only way you could
be less productive

15:57.958 --> 16:00.669
is if you were the wall
on which you're leaning.

16:00.752 --> 16:03.505
But then you'd be providing some jackass

16:03.589 --> 16:07.426
with a wall on which to lean
and reflect on what a jackass he is.

16:07.509 --> 16:11.346
l know. Here it's a conundrum.
But don't you worry about it.

16:11.430 --> 16:14.641
l'll tackle that one right upstairs.
ln the meantime,

16:14.725 --> 16:16.935
you could pretend
to be doing some work.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.897
And, even though
you don't have your basket,

16:19.980 --> 16:23.442
it's just a terrific time
for you to skip away, Shirley.

16:23.525 --> 16:25.360
Skip away.

16:25.444 --> 16:28.572
Skip away. Go ahead.

16:33.577 --> 16:36.079
- Hello, Philip.
- Lemon head.

16:37.122 --> 16:39.249
Yeah, l get it, cos of the hair.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.251
l was hard on you from the start,

16:41.335 --> 16:44.838
but, on the other hand, as you know,
you're an incredible tool.

16:44.922 --> 16:48.634
So l'll lay off if you drop
the attitude, and we'll start fresh.

16:48.717 --> 16:51.345
- What do you say?
- l don't wanna.

16:51.428 --> 16:55.307
But, if you've got a problem with that,
go see my father.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.601
l think l'll do that.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.604
Wait, Dr Reid.

17:00.687 --> 17:05.943
l had some time to think about it and,
what the hell? Let's start fresh.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.694
Philly...

17:08.779 --> 17:10.864
l don't wanna.

17:12.074 --> 17:14.242
Sorry we got interrupted before.

17:14.326 --> 17:17.829
- lt's OK.
- Where were we?

17:17.913 --> 17:21.375
l told you my parents were
still married, you yelled at me.

17:21.458 --> 17:24.127
Right. Of course l did.
That's me all over.

17:24.211 --> 17:28.715
- Why are you washing your hands?
- l don't honestly know.

17:28.799 --> 17:31.802
l guess l don't have
anything of interest to say.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.429
l got something to say.

17:34.513 --> 17:37.808
Dr Cox, you are an attending,
so you should know

17:37.891 --> 17:42.229
it's inappropriate for you to be
sniffing around this woman all day!

17:42.312 --> 17:46.024
And you! You are a med student
who should be learning from me,

17:46.108 --> 17:49.111
but every time l turn around,
you're talking to him.

17:49.194 --> 17:53.490
So l'm telling you, l forbid you
to get involved with that guy.

17:53.574 --> 17:55.784
Sorry, doctor.

17:55.951 --> 18:01.707
You do realise that you just effectively
signed your own death warrant.

18:01.790 --> 18:05.544
Dude, do you, like,
know any women at all?

18:09.256 --> 18:11.258
Hi.

18:11.341 --> 18:15.804
l know we're not supposed to be
seeing each other, but...

18:20.225 --> 18:22.686
Why did you page me?

18:22.769 --> 18:25.397
l don't know why l still
have this thing on.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.901
Put your gloves on, Josh.
l need you to get an ABG.

18:28.984 --> 18:31.445
- l can't.
- Newbie, wait.

18:31.528 --> 18:33.071
''Newbie''?

18:33.155 --> 18:36.366
You're the only one who knows
if you wanna be a doctor.

18:36.450 --> 18:38.952
But right now l got my hands full. OK?

18:39.036 --> 18:43.624
What do you say you put some gloves on,
Shirley, and get the hell in here?

18:47.794 --> 18:51.381
Now, locate the radial pulse.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.220
Josh, look at me. You can do this.

19:03.894 --> 19:05.979
lt looks good.

19:07.356 --> 19:09.816
No way.

19:09.900 --> 19:13.612
What do you want, a cookie?
Put your scrubs on and get back here.

19:13.695 --> 19:15.781
Go, go, go!

19:17.991 --> 19:20.327
Go ahead.

19:20.410 --> 19:22.496
That's it.

19:23.372 --> 19:26.792
- Could you redo that?
- Yeah.

19:27.501 --> 19:29.711
Could l get some more wine?

19:29.795 --> 19:34.216
Puh-lease, keep drinking.

19:34.299 --> 19:38.595
l'm throwing myself at you, and
you're still trying to get me drunk.

19:38.679 --> 19:43.517
Well, baby, you gotta
play all 48 minutes.

19:44.810 --> 19:47.396
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

19:47.479 --> 19:49.022
This is fun.

19:49.106 --> 19:52.568
l love the part right before
we start hating each other.

19:52.651 --> 19:55.362
- Really?
- You wanna know something?

19:55.445 --> 19:57.322
What?

19:57.406 --> 20:01.285
l feel like l'm using you
to get past another person.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.579
That's not as sexy as you think it is.

20:03.662 --> 20:05.706
lt's this nurse.

20:05.789 --> 20:10.169
This unavailable nurse?
l swear...

20:10.252 --> 20:13.547
Look, Kristen, l think you're great,

20:13.630 --> 20:16.216
but this whole thing's
just not fair to you.

20:16.300 --> 20:19.386
lf it's OK with you,

20:19.469 --> 20:24.224
l think l'll go ahead
and decide what's fair to me.

20:37.029 --> 20:39.114
That works for everybody.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.825
Perry?

20:41.909 --> 20:44.453
Actually, l prefer ''Dr Cox''.

20:45.746 --> 20:48.165
You like strong women, don't you?

20:48.248 --> 20:52.085
Are you kidding me? They're
the only ones l let ruin my life.

20:57.257 --> 21:01.470
- This is way too easy.
- Bring it on!

21:01.553 --> 21:03.222
Stop talking.

21:04.973 --> 21:09.728
Dr Reid, l wrote out your admission
orders and got the blood cultures.

21:09.811 --> 21:12.564
Good. Now, beat it. l'm eating.

21:14.358 --> 21:19.238
- Elliot, you ball-buster!
- l know! lsn't it great?

21:19.321 --> 21:22.157
<i>A lot of us freak out
when med students come.</i>

21:22.241 --> 21:25.869
<i>It feels like being forced
to accept new people into your family.</i>

21:25.953 --> 21:28.080
<i>It changes everything.</i>

21:28.705 --> 21:33.919
<i>Me, I was more struck by how
these newbies made me look at myself.</i>

21:34.002 --> 21:36.088
<i>Who I used to be,...</i>

21:37.381 --> 21:39.967
<i>...who I am now,...</i>

21:40.050 --> 21:42.803
<i>...and who I might
some day become.</i>

21:43.512 --> 21:45.639
<i>But hopefully, not too soon.</i>

21:45.722 --> 21:48.141
<i>- Player
- Hold me down</i>

21:48.225 --> 21:50.519
- Such dorks.
- My God!

21:50.602 --> 21:52.229
''My God!''
