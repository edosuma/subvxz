-Harry's here.

49:33.640 --> 49:36.280
-Harry's alive.

49:36.320 --> 49:39.000
You fucking with me?

49:39.040 --> 49:40.040
Is he alive?

49:40.080 --> 49:41.800
Where is he?

49:41.840 --> 49:43.600
Said, please!

49:43.640 --> 49:46.040
Huh? Stay with me! Stay with me!
Don't you die on me!

49:47.360 --> 49:49.680
Don't you fucking die on me!

49:49.720 --> 49:51.960
[sirens wailing,
tires screeching]

49:54.960 --> 49:56.480
Where's Harry?
Is he alive?

50:39.560 --> 50:41.560
