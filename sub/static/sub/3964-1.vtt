00:34.350 --> 00:36.409
Iwas kind of a strange child.

00:36.986 --> 00:40.319
My parents knew early on
that something was wrong with me.

00:40.390 --> 00:42.415
I crawled backwards until I was two...

00:42.492 --> 00:46.189
but had Kennedy's inaugural address
memorized by the time I was six.

00:47.397 --> 00:50.889
It all began when my mother didn't
show up for my first birthday party...

00:50.967 --> 00:52.867
because she was having my sister.

00:52.936 --> 00:56.463
My dad tried to cheer me up
by letting me eat the whole cake.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.973
I knew then
there had to be more to life than this.

01:17.360 --> 01:21.057
When I was a kid, I thought only
three people worked for General Motors:

01:21.131 --> 01:25.192
Pat Boone, Dinah Shore and my dad.

01:26.536 --> 01:29.994
Our hometown of Flint, Michigan,
was the birthplace of General Motors...

01:30.073 --> 01:32.303
the largest corporation in the world.

01:32.375 --> 01:36.436
There were more auto factories and
workers here than in any city on Earth.

01:37.213 --> 01:41.047
We built Cadillacs, Buicks,
and Fisher bodies...

01:41.584 --> 01:45.611
GM trucks, Chevrolets,
and AC spark plugs.

01:46.589 --> 01:50.685
We enjoyed a prosperity
that working people had never seen.

01:50.760 --> 01:52.921
And the city was grateful to the company.

01:52.996 --> 01:56.488
With the whole city rocking,
Flint, Michigan, throws a birthday party.

01:56.566 --> 01:59.763
It's for the people of General Motors
on their 50th anniversary.

01:59.836 --> 02:01.929
Pat Boone celebrates with a song.

02:03.239 --> 02:07.437
The promise of the future is the keynote
set by GM President, Harlow Curtis.

02:09.112 --> 02:11.603
From the world of TV
comes Sergeant Garcia...

02:11.681 --> 02:13.808
and the swordsman known as Zorro.

02:15.985 --> 02:17.680
But the big hit of the parade...

02:17.754 --> 02:21.121
is the lively marching
of the Elks junior drill team.

02:25.195 --> 02:27.959
The citizens of Flint,
birthplace of General Motors...

02:28.031 --> 02:30.431
also see the radiant Miss America.

02:30.500 --> 02:34.129
This was Flint as I remember,
where every day was a great day.

02:34.204 --> 02:36.195
It's a great day, all right.

02:36.606 --> 02:38.972
A salute to Mr. And Mrs. America.

03:09.706 --> 03:14.609
My dad worked on the assembly line at
GM's AC Spark Plug in Flint for 33 years.

03:15.211 --> 03:18.977
In fact, as I grew older, I discovered
my entire family had worked for GM:

03:19.048 --> 03:23.610
grandparents, parents, brothers, sisters,
aunts, uncles, cousins. Everyone but me.

03:24.621 --> 03:28.022
My uncle Laverne
was in the Great Flint Sit-Down Strike.

03:28.091 --> 03:30.958
Just hours before the year's end in 1936...

03:31.027 --> 03:34.428
he and thousands of other GM workers
took over the Flint factories...

03:34.497 --> 03:38.763
and barricaded themselves inside,
refusing to budge for 44 days.

03:39.502 --> 03:43.302
The National Guard was called in,
and the eyes of the world were on Flint.

03:43.539 --> 03:47.635
On February 1 1, 1937,
General Motors gave in...

03:47.877 --> 03:49.640
and the UAW was born.

03:51.581 --> 03:53.981
The GM employee
has made great advances.

03:54.117 --> 03:56.642
It is our wish that he continue to prosper.

03:56.953 --> 04:00.445
Most of our employees,
even those who at times cause problems...

04:00.823 --> 04:03.519
are conscientious
and hardworking men and women.

04:03.726 --> 04:08.129
Men and women to whose imagination,
ingenuity, energy and dedication...

04:08.531 --> 04:11.398
our country owes
its industrial leadership in the world.

04:11.901 --> 04:15.393
That all sounded fine and good,
but the assembly line wasn't for me.

04:15.471 --> 04:18.872
My heroes were the Flint people
who'd escaped the life in the factory...

04:18.942 --> 04:22.275
and got out of Flint,
like the guys in Grand Funk Railroad...

04:22.812 --> 04:27.181
Casey Kasem, the women who married
Zubin Mehta and Don Knotts...

04:27.350 --> 04:30.877
and perhaps Flint's
most famous native son, Bob Eubanks...

04:31.087 --> 04:33.988
host of TV's hit show
The Newlywed Game.

04:34.324 --> 04:38.226
I figured if Bob Eubanks
could make it out of here, so could I.

04:39.829 --> 04:42.320
After 10 years of editing my own paper
in Flint...

04:42.398 --> 04:45.299
a California millionaire
asked me to be the editor...

04:45.368 --> 04:47.893
of his muckraking magazine
in San Francisco.

04:48.137 --> 04:50.731
It didn't take me long
to figure out what to do.

04:50.807 --> 04:53.469
The final issue of the Michigan Voice
is being printed.

04:53.543 --> 04:57.479
Ten years after he began it, Michael Moore
is moving to San Francisco.

05:00.450 --> 05:03.647
What would you do?
I mean, this was San Francisco.

05:07.056 --> 05:10.583
But San Francisco was on
the other side of the world from Flint.

05:10.793 --> 05:13.819
Everyone there had a job,
yet no one seemed to be working.

05:13.896 --> 05:16.956
The cafÃ©s were filled with people
at 3:00 p.m.

05:18.167 --> 05:22.126
I was told there's one restaurant
for every 44 people in San Francisco...

05:22.205 --> 05:24.765
but most of them
seemed to be dessert places.

05:25.174 --> 05:28.575
Trying to get a simple cup of coffee
became a nightmare for me.

05:28.644 --> 05:31.841
Espresso, double espresso,
cappuccino, double cappuccino...

05:31.914 --> 05:35.145
Iatte, double latte, mocha, double mocha...

05:35.618 --> 05:38.815
caffe con panna, macchiato,
double macchiato...

05:39.622 --> 05:42.420
caffe bianco, or house blend.

05:43.393 --> 05:47.955
I was feeling disoriented living in a town
that didn't carry any nondairy creamer.

05:48.331 --> 05:50.026
I went to work and announced...

05:50.099 --> 05:53.296
that I was going to give a monthly column
to a Flint auto worker.

05:53.369 --> 05:57.396
The owner instead told me to run
an investigative report on herbal teas.

05:57.640 --> 06:01.076
I told him I had a better idea:
Let's put the auto worker on the cover.

06:01.144 --> 06:05.376
The owner wasn't amused and declared
that California and I were a mismatch...

06:05.448 --> 06:08.679
just before he offered me
my free U-Haul back to Michigan.

06:10.987 --> 06:12.648
-Hello, Dad.
-Hello, son.

06:12.989 --> 06:15.514
-It's been a long time.
-lt sure has.

06:16.059 --> 06:17.959
-Where's Mom?
-ln the kitchen.

06:25.935 --> 06:28.130
Why, your hands are filthy!

06:29.138 --> 06:32.369
-Go upstairs and wash them.
-Okay, Mom.

06:32.442 --> 06:34.808
Okay, so my homecoming
wasn't quite like that.

06:34.877 --> 06:38.938
In fact, I wasn't back in Flint more than
a few days when the bad news hit.

06:41.050 --> 06:44.508
This is the CBS Evening News,
Dan Rather reporting.

06:44.887 --> 06:46.081
Good evening.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.986
General Motors confirmed it today.

06:48.057 --> 06:51.788
It is going to close plants
employing almost 30,000 workers.

06:51.894 --> 06:55.125
Today we are announcing the closing...

06:55.231 --> 06:57.791
of 1 1 of our older plants.

06:58.101 --> 07:01.434
While Detroit and Pontiac
will certainly be hurt by the shutdowns...

07:01.504 --> 07:04.496
the effect on Flint
is absolutely devastating.

07:07.877 --> 07:11.142
Devastating wasn't the half of it.
Maybe I got this wrong...

07:11.214 --> 07:14.445
but I thought companies lay off people
when they hit hard times.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.644
GM was the richest company
in the world...

07:16.719 --> 07:20.450
and it was closing factories
when it was making profits in the billions.

07:20.523 --> 07:24.186
We do not have any plan
to cut our workforce by 80,000.

07:24.260 --> 07:27.354
That was kind of
a what-happens-if type of thing.

07:28.931 --> 07:31.161
So this was GM chairman Roger Smith.

07:31.467 --> 07:33.731
He appeared to have a brilliant plan:

07:34.337 --> 07:36.464
First close 1 1 factories in the U.S...

07:36.539 --> 07:40.202
then open 1 1 in Mexico, where
you pay the workers 70 cents an hour.

07:40.543 --> 07:44.479
Use the money you saved by building cars
in Mexico to take over other companies...

07:44.547 --> 07:47.675
preferably high-tech firms
and weapons manufacturers.

07:49.018 --> 07:50.883
Next, tell the union you're broke...

07:50.953 --> 07:54.218
and they happily give back
a couple of billion dollars in wage cuts.

07:54.290 --> 07:56.155
Then take that money from workers...

07:56.225 --> 07:59.251
and eliminate their jobs
by building more foreign factories.

07:59.328 --> 08:01.558
Roger Smith was a true genius.

08:01.631 --> 08:05.567
I think our employees
have got a new emphasis on job security...

08:05.635 --> 08:07.899
and we want to try
and help them with that.

08:07.970 --> 08:11.337
-What do you have to say to Roger Smith?
-It's gonna be rough.

08:11.407 --> 08:13.705
I can't mention it on television.

08:15.111 --> 08:17.841
This was to be
the first of many layoffs in Flint...

08:17.914 --> 08:20.178
the final day for the GM truck plant.

08:21.384 --> 08:23.716
I think most of you are aware...

08:24.220 --> 08:27.212
that this is the first major plant closing...

08:27.290 --> 08:29.815
to take place in Flint.
Let me rephrase that.

08:29.892 --> 08:32.918
This isn't a plant closing.
It's a loss of one product line.

08:41.770 --> 08:45.002
My friends and I decided to pose
as a TV crew from Toledo...

08:45.074 --> 08:46.905
to sneak inside the factory.

08:47.710 --> 08:50.770
I wasn't exactly sure
what a TV crew from Toledo looked like...

08:50.846 --> 08:55.112
but apparently the ruse worked, as we
filmed the last truck going down the line.

09:04.860 --> 09:07.920
What's everybody so happy about?
We just lost our jobs.

09:10.933 --> 09:13.731
Everybody's applauding.
They just lost their jobs.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.931
We're trying impress upon the employees
that are being laid off...

09:17.006 --> 09:20.635
that there is nothing out there for them...

09:20.710 --> 09:23.338
to depend upon for the future.

09:23.412 --> 09:27.678
The best thing Michigan and GM can do
is get rid of Roger Smith...

09:27.750 --> 09:29.718
and them other sons of bitches.

09:29.785 --> 09:31.946
That seemed to be
the general consensus...

09:32.021 --> 09:35.149
as I talked to many GM workers
about their chairman, Roger Smith.

09:35.224 --> 09:39.490
-What would you like to tell Roger Smith?
-I'd tell him to retire.

09:40.096 --> 09:43.930
He can't look an auto worker
in the eye, because....

09:44.000 --> 09:47.163
-He should be feeling guilty.
-Most people are hungry. He's not.

09:47.236 --> 09:49.568
I'd tell him to get off his big bucks...

09:49.639 --> 09:52.164
and start giving some of it
back to its workers.

09:53.109 --> 09:55.577
I'm sick and tired of these damn fat cats.

09:56.679 --> 10:00.740
I could say a few choice words,
but I'm a lady and I was raised a lady...

10:01.651 --> 10:04.085
so I won't say what I really feel...

10:05.788 --> 10:08.814
but I could use some unsavory language
as far as the fat cats.

10:09.158 --> 10:12.355
Fire Roger Smith!

10:12.428 --> 10:15.192
There were those
who had a different opinion in Flint...

10:15.264 --> 10:18.392
Iike Tom Kay,
a spokesman and lobbyist for GM.

10:18.467 --> 10:20.901
I'm sure that Roger Smith...

10:20.970 --> 10:24.963
has a social conscience
as strong as anybody else in the country.

10:25.141 --> 10:28.907
Because a guy is an automobile executive
does not make him inhuman.

10:29.378 --> 10:32.745
I've talked to enough of them.
I know what their concerns are.

10:32.815 --> 10:36.876
He has as much concern
about these people as you or I do...

10:38.154 --> 10:42.523
and nobody likes to see anybody laid off
or put in a hardship situation.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.584
-Have you ever talked to Roger Smith?
-Sure.

10:45.661 --> 10:48.027
What kind of man do you find him to be?

10:48.097 --> 10:50.895
A very warm man. I have....

10:52.501 --> 10:53.866
A warm man?

10:54.537 --> 10:56.801
Did I have Roger Smith judged all wrong...

10:56.872 --> 11:00.399
simply because he was eliminating
30,000 jobs from my hometown?

11:01.911 --> 11:03.469
I decided to find out.

11:03.646 --> 11:08.208
I wrote. I phoned. I faxed. I tried
every means of communication available...

11:08.284 --> 11:10.684
but nothing got me any closer to Roger.

11:10.853 --> 11:12.582
I was left with no choice.

11:12.655 --> 11:16.022
I got in the car and drove
about an hour south of Flint to Detroit...

11:16.092 --> 11:18.287
to the world headquarters
of General Motors.

11:19.428 --> 11:21.191
My mission was a simple one:

11:21.263 --> 11:24.096
to convince Roger Smith
to spend a day with me in Flint...

11:24.166 --> 11:27.135
and meet some of the people
who were losing their jobs.

11:45.254 --> 11:46.619
Everybody in?

11:50.092 --> 11:53.687
-Can I help you gentlemen and ladies?
-Yes, we're going to the 14th floor.

11:53.763 --> 11:56.231
-Do you have an appointment?
-No, we don't.

11:56.432 --> 11:59.265
-I think you need an appointment.
-To go up there?

12:00.603 --> 12:03.697
-How can we make one?
-You want to step out....

12:05.241 --> 12:08.210
-First of all, anything above--
-We came down from Flint.

12:08.277 --> 12:12.611
Anything above the first level here
is private property. That's off-limits.

12:13.382 --> 12:17.182
-This is all off-limits. It's a security area.
-This is? All right.

12:17.586 --> 12:19.554
Listen, who did you want to talk to?

12:20.222 --> 12:23.919
-I want to talk to Roger Smith.
-I'll get a PR man and we'll see.

12:24.193 --> 12:27.822
-What kind of movie are you making?
-It's a documentary on Flint.

12:28.464 --> 12:30.125
On the labor problems?

12:30.199 --> 12:33.259
The whole situation,
the plant shutdowns, the layoffs.

12:33.836 --> 12:38.273
We'll try to have someone contact you
as soon as someone's available.

12:38.340 --> 12:41.832
-All right, I'd appreciate it.
-Have you got some kind of credentials?

12:41.911 --> 12:44.641
-Where they can contact you?
-What's your name?

12:44.713 --> 12:47.341
Herb Slaughter.
I'll give you a business card.

12:52.087 --> 12:55.488
Let's see, I've got a frequent-flier card...

12:57.760 --> 12:58.749
Visa....

13:00.029 --> 13:04.227
I was having a hard time finding my
business card, because I don't have any.

13:04.300 --> 13:07.599
So I gave Mr. Slaughter my discount pass
to Chuck E. Cheese...

13:07.670 --> 13:10.332
but he said that wouldn't get me in
to see Mr. Smith.

13:10.406 --> 13:14.604
So I headed back to Flint for further
guidance from GM lobbyist Tom Kay.

13:15.044 --> 13:18.980
General Motors wouldn't be doing
anybody any service if it goes bankrupt.

13:19.448 --> 13:21.177
It has to do what it has to do...

13:21.283 --> 13:24.480
in order to stay competitive
in today's economic climate.

13:24.553 --> 13:28.649
Even if it means eliminating 18,000 jobs?

13:28.724 --> 13:31.488
Even if it means eliminating 20,000 jobs.

13:31.627 --> 13:33.595
-Or 30,000?
-Whatever.

13:34.029 --> 13:36.293
How about all the jobs here in Flint?

13:37.233 --> 13:38.700
It could feasibly happen.

13:39.034 --> 13:42.299
Good evening, I'm Sue Zelenko.
Bill Harris has the night off.

13:42.371 --> 13:44.339
It was where the UAW was born.

13:44.406 --> 13:48.467
Tonight 3,000 people are trying to decide
what to do with their lives.

13:48.544 --> 13:51.104
Nobody was ready for the announced
plant shutdowns today...

13:51.180 --> 13:52.738
Ieast of all, the 1,350 workers.

13:52.815 --> 13:55.249
The last truck chassis headed
down the line this morning.

13:55.317 --> 13:57.785
Virtually all the 3,400 people are on layoff.

13:57.853 --> 13:59.946
Larry Elliot was at the plant today...

14:00.022 --> 14:02.889
as that last car was making its way
down the assembly line.

14:02.958 --> 14:07.418
Will this plant build engines again
if the rush back to small cars occurs?

14:07.796 --> 14:09.195
The answer is no.

14:09.431 --> 14:12.366
In Flint, Joe Weaver,
Channel 2 Eyewitness News.

14:12.434 --> 14:13.992
More factories had closed...

14:14.069 --> 14:17.129
and I began to see the effect
this was having on my friends.

14:17.206 --> 14:21.336
Ben was the worker I'd put on the cover
of that magazine in San Francisco.

14:21.977 --> 14:24.969
He'd been laid off
five times in five years from GM.

14:25.047 --> 14:29.279
Expecting to be laid off again, he cracked
one night working on the assembly line.

14:29.718 --> 14:32.983
He was now shooting hoop
at the local mental health center.

14:34.356 --> 14:36.586
I couldn't take it. I told the guy next to me:

14:36.659 --> 14:39.890
"Tell the foreman I'm sick.
I don't give a shit what you tell him."

14:39.962 --> 14:43.420
I grabbed my coat, flew out the door,
passed the guards...

14:43.532 --> 14:45.966
jumped into my car,
got onto Bristol Road...

14:46.035 --> 14:48.265
and was flying toward my apartment.

14:48.704 --> 14:51.366
I turned on the radio,
hoping that might cheer me up...

14:51.440 --> 14:53.408
I had tears coming out of my eyes...

14:53.475 --> 14:57.571
and I strike right into the middle
of Wouldn't It Be Nice by The Beach Boys.

14:58.180 --> 15:01.343
And I'm thinking, "What a horrible song...

15:01.417 --> 15:04.011
"to have to hear
in the midst of this panic attack."

15:04.086 --> 15:07.852
A song that I'd usually
get a groove going with.

15:08.490 --> 15:12.187
I'm trying to sing the lyrics,
and I've got an apple in my throat.

15:18.067 --> 15:20.501
I'm trying to rationalize with those lyrics...

15:20.569 --> 15:24.061
trying to think, "Wouldn't it be nice?"
And it just wasn't working.

15:46.095 --> 15:49.496
Some disturbing news today from
the Genesee County Health Department.

15:49.565 --> 15:51.760
It announced the rat population in Flint...

15:51.834 --> 15:54.564
has now surpassed
the human population by 50,000.

15:54.637 --> 15:57.970
Health officials say it's due
to massive numbers of people leaving...

15:58.040 --> 16:01.134
and the city cutting back
to twice-monthly garbage collection...

16:01.210 --> 16:02.939
due to budget constraints.

16:43.919 --> 16:47.616
Just when things were looking bleak,
Ronald Reagan arrived in Flint...

16:47.690 --> 16:50.625
and took a dozen unemployed workers
out for a pizza.

16:51.727 --> 16:56.061
He told them he had a great idea.
If they tried it, they'd all be working again.

16:56.465 --> 16:58.695
He suggested that maybe some of us...

16:58.767 --> 17:01.793
could find better jobs elsewhere...

17:01.870 --> 17:04.430
Iike in Texas, or in the southern states.

17:05.540 --> 17:07.372
That's when I spoke up...

17:07.443 --> 17:10.502
because I have a son, a home.

17:10.579 --> 17:15.175
I'm trying to do it by myself. I can't just
pull up stakes and take off by myself.

17:15.250 --> 17:18.242
We don't hold public office,
we're nobody special...

17:18.319 --> 17:20.481
but he wanted our opinions and views.

17:20.556 --> 17:24.287
It was at a level I could understand,
and I liked his ideas...

17:25.794 --> 17:27.728
that he voiced to us.

17:30.899 --> 17:34.562
None of Reagan's luncheon guests
got back into the factory in later years.

17:34.636 --> 17:36.900
The only bright spot of the whole affair...

17:36.972 --> 17:40.237
was the individual who borrowed
the restaurant's cash register...

17:40.309 --> 17:42.277
on the way out the door.

17:53.222 --> 17:57.591
Meanwhile, Flint's more fortunate were
holding their annual Great Gatsby Party...

17:57.659 --> 18:00.219
at the home
of one of GM's founding families.

18:00.996 --> 18:04.295
To show they weren't totally insensitive
to the plight of others...

18:04.366 --> 18:07.631
they hired local people
to be human statues at the party.

18:16.245 --> 18:18.611
What's it like in Flint these days?

18:19.548 --> 18:22.779
Things are tough here
for the people that are laid off.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.645
There's still people working.

18:24.720 --> 18:28.713
I don't think it's as bad
as people may believe.

18:30.058 --> 18:32.458
We started something,
and we're gonna finish it.

18:32.528 --> 18:35.019
-We're gonna be the leaders.
-What did we start?

18:35.097 --> 18:37.031
We started the industrial revolution...

18:37.099 --> 18:40.865
an art form that's never been created
in the history of mankind.

18:41.570 --> 18:44.937
-What was that industrial revolution?
-The cars. Steel.

18:45.808 --> 18:49.005
It took off from there.
We invented the wheel again.

18:49.077 --> 18:50.738
We're off again and running.

18:54.216 --> 18:57.481
What advice do you have
for those having a rough go of it?

18:57.686 --> 19:00.177
Get up in the morning
and go do something.

19:00.622 --> 19:04.558
Start yourself. Get your own motor going.
There's things to do out there.

19:06.595 --> 19:11.498
I don't think it's fair to pick on
the negative things and publicize them...

19:12.334 --> 19:15.098
and not pick up
any of the good aspects about Flint.

19:15.170 --> 19:17.331
What are some of those good aspects?

19:17.873 --> 19:22.810
-The ballet. Your kids were involved in it.
-Ballet. Hockey. It's a great place to live.

19:57.479 --> 19:59.674
Sheriff's department. Anybody home?

20:00.215 --> 20:01.147
Hello?

20:06.088 --> 20:08.921
I had found one man in Flint
with a secure job:

20:09.224 --> 20:11.351
sheriff's deputy Fred Ross.

20:13.495 --> 20:16.362
I treat a person
the way I would like to be treated.

20:16.965 --> 20:21.095
You know, I explain to them
that I got a job to do.

20:21.169 --> 20:23.296
The court issued the order, not me.

20:23.739 --> 20:26.207
If you can make peace
with your landlord, good.

20:26.275 --> 20:28.106
If you can't, you've got a problem.

20:34.416 --> 20:36.646
I've put out some good people.

20:38.620 --> 20:42.420
You have a lot of people in this town
paying $800 to $900 a month house note.

20:42.491 --> 20:45.426
That's a lot of money
to try to pay on unemployment.

20:50.399 --> 20:52.560
Some of these people
don't want to leave...

20:53.368 --> 20:55.302
especially older people.

20:55.370 --> 20:57.998
Some of them have retired from the shop.

20:59.775 --> 21:01.902
Taxes catch a lot of them, too.

21:06.281 --> 21:10.411
So if things go down,
they close up some plants here...

21:10.752 --> 21:13.277
this town is gonna be a rough place.

21:16.124 --> 21:18.149
I continued my search for Roger.

21:18.760 --> 21:22.218
I scoured the neighborhoods
of Grosse Pointe, Grosse Pointe Woods...

21:22.297 --> 21:24.857
Grosse Pointe Farms, Grosse Pointe Park...

21:25.067 --> 21:27.900
Grosse Pointe Shores,
and Bloomfield Hills.

21:29.237 --> 21:31.228
I tried in vain to locate his house...

21:31.306 --> 21:34.605
but the name Smith
was a common one among these people.

21:35.410 --> 21:39.244
I then read that Roger was going to be
at the Grosse Pointe Yacht Club.

21:39.448 --> 21:41.541
I decided to drop in on the affair.

21:45.454 --> 21:47.115
I haven't seen him.

21:47.189 --> 21:50.454
-You haven't seen him here yet?
-Just a moment.

21:52.561 --> 21:55.325
-Are you calling him?
-Who, Roger Smith?

21:55.397 --> 21:57.422
You want me to call Roger Smith?

21:58.600 --> 22:02.229
I'm trying to get the manager to see
if anybody knows anything about him.

22:02.304 --> 22:05.569
I'm sure he said the Grosse Pointe.
I mean it wasn't him--

22:05.640 --> 22:07.005
Who, his office?

22:07.075 --> 22:10.272
-Why don't we call his office and find out?
-We could do that.

22:10.779 --> 22:13.942
I have a television crew down here
with Michael Moore.

22:14.016 --> 22:18.248
He's supposed to meet Roger Smith
at noon. I have no information.

22:20.655 --> 22:23.624
How often does Mr. Smith come here
for lunch or dinner?

22:23.692 --> 22:26.456
Last time I saw him here
was for Sportsmen's Night.

22:27.062 --> 22:29.326
-What's that?
-It's a wild game dinner.

22:30.732 --> 22:33.428
-You go and shoot your own animal?
-Pardon me?

22:33.502 --> 22:36.335
You go and shoot your animals
and bring them here to eat--

22:36.405 --> 22:38.600
Some of the stuff is donated.

22:39.574 --> 22:42.907
There are foods like rattlesnake....

22:44.579 --> 22:47.104
Let me think of some real exotic foods.

22:48.183 --> 22:49.411
Alligator.

22:51.486 --> 22:53.420
-You eat this stuff here?
-Roast beef.

22:53.488 --> 22:55.012
That sounds better.

22:56.858 --> 23:00.919
I obviously had the wrong yacht club,
because Roger was nowhere to be found.

23:01.396 --> 23:05.696
I didn't have more time to waste here,
because back at Flint's county fair...

23:05.967 --> 23:09.733
thousands of people were being
entertained by the diving donkeys...

23:10.072 --> 23:13.064
anxiously awaiting the return
of our boyhood hero...

23:13.141 --> 23:15.905
as he made his triumphant return
home to Flint.

23:16.445 --> 23:20.040
From Genesee County Fair,
the newlywed capital of the world...

23:20.415 --> 23:22.144
here come the newlyweds!

23:22.918 --> 23:25.785
A big hand. This is your part....

23:27.722 --> 23:29.121
There they come.

23:30.025 --> 23:31.925
Yes, it's The Newlywed Game...

23:31.993 --> 23:34.553
and these are
our newlywed couples for today.

23:34.629 --> 23:37.598
Let's all meet the host and star
of The Newlywed Game:

23:37.666 --> 23:40.396
Bob Eubanks!

23:46.441 --> 23:50.400
Hello, everybody. Welcome.
How nice of you to come here today.

23:50.479 --> 23:53.243
Welcome to the opening of....
Hi, Mom. How are you doing?

23:53.315 --> 23:54.475
You devil, you!

23:54.549 --> 23:57.609
What about questions like,
"How heavy are your wife's breasts?"

23:57.686 --> 24:00.746
I never ask that. I say,
"What does your wife's chest weigh?"

24:00.822 --> 24:03.950
There's a lot of difference
in that question you just asked....

24:04.025 --> 24:07.722
A hell of a lot of difference.
That's where I think we get a bad rap.

24:07.796 --> 24:10.731
People like yourself
will quote a question like that.

24:10.799 --> 24:14.701
I wouldn't ask that question for anything.
I wouldn't even say "breasts."

24:14.769 --> 24:16.794
First question. These are easy questions.

24:17.205 --> 24:20.732
Ladies, how much did your husband say
your chest weighs?

24:21.042 --> 24:23.636
-Gladys, what do you say, sweetheart?
-Two pounds.

24:23.712 --> 24:26.476
Two pounds!
He said six-and-a-half ounces.

24:29.484 --> 24:32.612
I said, "Both of them."
He said, "That is both of them."

24:32.687 --> 24:35.679
I said, "I'm sorry."
He said, "Not as sorry as I am."

24:37.058 --> 24:40.994
Bob was right. He didn't say "breasts "
and I considered apologizing...

24:41.062 --> 24:45.055
for implying that his show
wasn't wholesome family entertainment.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.660
You know why
Jewish women don't get AlDS?

24:47.736 --> 24:50.899
Because they marry assholes,
they don't screw them. Pardon me.

24:51.473 --> 24:54.033
Ladies and gentlemen,
that's all for this afternoon.

24:54.109 --> 24:57.909
If I made you smile one time, I'm happy.
I had a good time. I hope you did, too.

24:57.979 --> 25:00.174
Until next time.
We'll be back every night....

25:00.248 --> 25:03.081
I'm Bob Eubanks. So long, everybody.
See you then.

25:06.621 --> 25:09.784
I was born here in Flint,
but I don't know anything about it.

25:10.525 --> 25:12.959
I can only tell you this about this town:

25:14.095 --> 25:15.426
It's pretty...

25:15.897 --> 25:17.626
and the people are nice.

25:17.799 --> 25:22.168
I don't know much about the economy,
but I can take you to places in the U.S...

25:22.404 --> 25:26.340
much worse off than Flint, Michigan.
I don't think it's such a bad town.

25:30.979 --> 25:35.643
With 30,000 jobs now eliminated,
the city decided to turn to the one event...

25:35.717 --> 25:38.618
that had always made us so happy:
the big parade...

25:39.254 --> 25:42.712
this time honoring the surviving
Flint Sit-Down Strikers.

25:48.530 --> 25:52.159
The highlight of the parade
was Miss Michigan, Kaye Lani Rae Rafko.

25:52.567 --> 25:56.901
Passing by dozens of boarded-up stores
and hundreds of jobless Flint citizens...

25:57.138 --> 25:59.834
she was an inspiring sight to all present.

26:02.210 --> 26:04.508
How do you feel
about the economy in Flint?

26:04.579 --> 26:06.604
The factories all shutting down?

26:06.848 --> 26:10.443
This isn't my interview yet.
This is my time for enjoyment.

26:15.557 --> 26:18.856
All kinds of important people showed up
to march in the parade...

26:18.927 --> 26:21.623
Iike the governor of Michigan,
James Blanchard.

26:22.397 --> 26:25.992
How do you feel about General Motors
closing up these factories in Flint?

26:26.067 --> 26:28.262
It's tragic.

26:28.870 --> 26:31.304
Do you think
we need another sit-down strike?

26:31.373 --> 26:33.841
That won't do any good.
That's the problem.

26:34.342 --> 26:36.776
Is this a great time for a parade?

26:39.381 --> 26:41.872
I think so, too. Let's have a fun time!

26:43.184 --> 26:45.948
Give your life to Jesus today.

26:46.021 --> 26:48.990
Jesus Christ loves you.
Give your life to Jesus.

26:49.057 --> 26:52.424
Tell your viewers they need Jesus!
Give your life to Jesus.

26:54.129 --> 26:56.461
How could you have a parade
for the founders...

26:56.531 --> 27:00.797
without inviting the current president
of the United Auto Workers, Owen Bieber?

27:01.202 --> 27:04.330
I don't know that
we need another sit-down strike per se.

27:04.406 --> 27:08.706
A sit-down strike today
would not necessarily resemble...

27:10.345 --> 27:14.907
or be able to bring about
the same thing that it did in 1937.

27:15.917 --> 27:20.081
The union is getting weaker.
We're losing power.

27:20.588 --> 27:23.887
Why? Because there's
too many guys in the union...

27:25.360 --> 27:27.760
that are friends with the management.

27:29.197 --> 27:33.463
Some plants that are announced
to be closed obviously will be closed.

27:35.236 --> 27:39.297
We have to accept the reality
that they're just not going to remain open.

27:39.674 --> 27:42.040
I think that with the spirit here...

27:43.011 --> 27:46.913
Flint will continue not only to survive,
but will continue to grow.

27:52.887 --> 27:56.015
Some people know what time it is.
Some people don't.

27:56.758 --> 27:59.454
Miss Michigan, could we talk to you
for one second?

27:59.527 --> 28:03.054
Your face looks familiar. Was this
when you caught me on the road?

28:03.131 --> 28:07.830
Yes, back in the parade. How does it feel
driving through Flint, Michigan, today...

28:07.902 --> 28:11.338
and so many people being laid off,
so many plants being shut down?

28:11.406 --> 28:15.035
-How does it feel? I feel like a supporter.
-Of?

28:15.410 --> 28:18.868
-Does it matter of what?
-A supporter of General Motors?

28:19.180 --> 28:22.707
Of just being here for the people.
Is it the parade?

28:22.784 --> 28:27.050
When you pass stores that are boarded-up
and people that are laid off...

28:27.122 --> 28:29.852
how does that make you feel
on a personal level?

28:31.926 --> 28:35.692
A little sad.
Of course, I'm for employment...

28:35.764 --> 28:38.562
and working in Michigan.

28:38.633 --> 28:40.897
And, hopefully, it's just temporarily.

28:40.969 --> 28:45.099
So, I just keep my fingers crossed
that they'll be back working soon.

28:46.274 --> 28:50.438
I'm trying to stay neutral. I'm going to
Miss America in two weeks, and I don't....

28:50.512 --> 28:54.881
-It's a great day for a parade, isn't it?
-It's beautiful. I can't believe the crowd.

28:54.949 --> 28:57.144
It's the largest parade I've been in...

28:57.218 --> 29:00.153
and I've been in over 20 since June.

29:00.221 --> 29:04.988
It's wonderful. I love coming back to Flint.
It's my third trip here, and I love it.

29:05.059 --> 29:06.890
Any message to the people of Flint?

29:06.961 --> 29:10.522
Keep your fingers crossed for me
as I go for the gold in two weeks...

29:10.598 --> 29:14.557
and hopefully bring back a crown
for Flint and the Michigan state.

29:14.903 --> 29:17.337
Two weeks later, she got her wish.

29:18.239 --> 29:20.104
Our new Miss America...

29:20.341 --> 29:22.775
Kaye Lani Rae Rafko, Miss Michigan!

29:51.039 --> 29:54.167
This is probably Number 15
I've been here and evicted someone.

29:54.242 --> 29:56.540
-From this house?
-Yes.

29:58.480 --> 30:00.607
Daryl? Sheriff's department.

30:12.527 --> 30:15.223
Get your clothes on.
We're here to put you out.

30:20.068 --> 30:23.629
-Here to do what?
-Evict you from the house. Right now.

30:29.310 --> 30:31.870
People stay up all night and sleep all day.

30:34.816 --> 30:37.717
Deputy Fred seemed
especially busy these days.

30:37.952 --> 30:40.546
After doing 24 evictions in one day...

30:40.622 --> 30:44.456
he arrived to evict a woman
who was a month behind in her rent.

30:44.559 --> 30:46.891
She quickly got the landlord on the phone.

30:46.961 --> 30:50.089
After telling him that
a film crew had arrived with the sheriff...

30:50.164 --> 30:53.964
the landlord told Fred
not to evict the woman and her children.

30:55.770 --> 30:59.103
It had leaked so much,
this whole area was bulging down.

30:59.173 --> 31:03.041
My oldest son.... I moved his bed,
I was scared the ceiling would fall.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.602
But nobody was there at the time it fell.

31:05.680 --> 31:09.309
It needed to be painted outside.
The aluminum siding outside, I put on.

31:09.384 --> 31:11.477
I paid for it and had it put on.

31:11.619 --> 31:14.087
See my new siding? It does look better.

31:14.188 --> 31:18.420
You put that on since last time I was here.
You've spent a lot of money.

31:20.428 --> 31:22.862
It looked like
the raggediest house on the block.

31:22.931 --> 31:25.923
These houses look nice
and I was embarrassed about it.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.265
The deal was pretty good,
so I worked with it.

31:30.405 --> 31:33.397
-What will happen to this woman?
-End up putting her out...

31:33.474 --> 31:36.534
unless her new husband
comes up with the money.

31:38.846 --> 31:42.612
I can't imagine somebody getting married
to someone as poor as you.

31:42.684 --> 31:46.552
It gets kind of rough.
Put two poor people in the same house....

31:48.489 --> 31:52.016
I always tell women, "You can be poor
by yourself, you don't need help."

31:52.093 --> 31:55.062
And she just got some help being poor.

31:58.499 --> 32:01.798
Three days later,
Fred put the woman and her kids out.

32:04.672 --> 32:07.937
-Hi, can I help you?
-We're looking for Roger Smith.

32:08.009 --> 32:09.909
We're wondering if he's here.

32:09.978 --> 32:13.971
I have no idea if he's here or not,
but you'll have to leave the club.

32:14.115 --> 32:16.242
-Why's that?
-It's a private club.

32:16.317 --> 32:19.775
-Has he been here today?
-To my knowledge, he has not.

32:20.254 --> 32:23.348
-Does he come here often?
-I really don't know.

32:23.424 --> 32:26.291
-ls he a member here?
-He is a member.

32:26.361 --> 32:28.454
But you don't know if he's been here?

32:28.529 --> 32:32.056
We don't keep track of our membership.
You'll have to leave the club, sir.

32:32.133 --> 32:34.499
-lt is a private building.
-You'd know if he--

32:34.569 --> 32:37.800
-Sir, we'll have to ask you to leave.
-I just want to find out--

32:37.872 --> 32:41.933
Sorry, you'll have to leave the club.
Call General Motors. Check with them.

32:42.010 --> 32:44.240
We have called GM. We can't get in there.

32:44.312 --> 32:47.839
If you can't get in there, you can't
get in here. Would you mind leaving?

32:50.051 --> 32:52.042
-We could just wait.
-No, you can't.

32:52.120 --> 32:55.317
They say you must leave the building, sir.
You have to step outside.

33:01.496 --> 33:02.861
We'll come back.

33:03.798 --> 33:07.598
I'll be right here.
They told me to take you outside.

33:09.771 --> 33:13.400
You may wait outside. If he comes in,
you can interview him outside.

33:13.474 --> 33:15.169
You may not interview him in here.

33:15.243 --> 33:17.302
You don't remember the last time
he was here?

33:17.378 --> 33:20.142
-That means nothing.
-When the chairman of GM is in here?

33:20.214 --> 33:21.806
That doesn't impress me.

33:21.883 --> 33:24.374
It doesn't impress you?
The chairman of GM?

33:24.452 --> 33:28.149
The chairman of General Motors is just
another member of our organization.

33:28.356 --> 33:32.554
He's an important individual, but no more
important than any other member.

33:33.227 --> 33:36.287
I wasn't having much success
bringing Roger to Flint.

33:37.565 --> 33:41.524
The mayor, though, was having better luck
with an even higher authority.

33:45.139 --> 33:48.870
He paid TV evangelist
Robert Schuller $20,000...

33:48.943 --> 33:52.276
to come to Flint and rid the city
of its unemployment plague.

33:55.283 --> 33:59.014
Tough times don't last,
but tough people do.

33:59.954 --> 34:04.118
Thousands filled the city's hockey arena
to hear his message of hope.

34:04.192 --> 34:06.353
Pull your way out of poverty!

34:06.427 --> 34:10.056
You won't pull your way
from poverty to prosperity...

34:10.130 --> 34:14.693
until you realize you have to be
humble enough to say, "I need help. "

34:21.242 --> 34:25.406
By then what happens is
you can turn your hurt into a halo.

34:28.649 --> 34:30.879
The sorrow becomes a servant.

34:42.163 --> 34:44.188
Just because you've got problems...

34:45.565 --> 34:48.763
is no excuse to be unhappy.

34:57.043 --> 34:58.875
Maybe Reverend Schuller was right.

34:58.946 --> 35:02.074
Things could be worse,
and there was much to be thankful for...

35:02.150 --> 35:04.084
Iike the Star Theatre of Flint...

35:04.152 --> 35:07.280
funded with GM money
to provide entertainment and escape...

35:07.355 --> 35:09.380
during Flint's hard times.

35:10.291 --> 35:12.384
Buick City, this is called.

35:13.795 --> 35:17.060
Rednecks, hardhat automotive workers.

35:17.999 --> 35:20.991
We bring Broadway
and the theater to them...

35:21.068 --> 35:25.004
in this beautiful edifice.
But that takes money, time, effort, energy.

35:25.072 --> 35:29.338
Bobby Vinton opened our season.
It was 90 percent sold out. It was a big hit.

35:29.410 --> 35:33.676
He has charisma. Came into the audience,
spent about 15 minutes with them...

35:33.748 --> 35:36.649
fussing with the ladies, kissing,
and they loved him.

35:36.717 --> 35:38.708
He got standing ovations every night.

35:38.786 --> 35:41.152
Peggy Lee came.
She wasn't the greatest hit.

35:41.222 --> 35:43.986
But she had her cult
from surrounding areas.

35:44.058 --> 35:47.516
Her cult love her.
Those who came absolutely loved her.

35:47.595 --> 35:51.258
Standing ovations, bravos, cheers....
They were crazy about her.

35:51.332 --> 35:53.823
Last year, Mitzi Gaynor came here
with her show.

35:53.901 --> 35:56.199
She brings 10 wonderful
boy dancers with her.

35:56.270 --> 36:00.036
She makes 16 changes. The boys make 14.

36:00.107 --> 36:03.634
When they're on, she's off.
She's on, they're off, changing costumes.

36:03.711 --> 36:05.611
One production number after another.

36:05.680 --> 36:10.549
You'd be surprised. Some of those
hard-hat factory workers say, "Hey! "

36:10.718 --> 36:15.417
They present their badge or identification,
so they can come at a half-price ticket...

36:15.489 --> 36:18.014
to keep them coming
when they're having hard times.

36:26.567 --> 36:28.501
Long before she sold orange juice...

36:28.569 --> 36:32.403
Anita Bryant sold spark plugs
for General Motors' AC division.

36:33.007 --> 36:35.908
She used to perform for General Motors
when I was a child.

36:35.977 --> 36:38.537
I remember her carrying around
a giant spark plug...

36:38.613 --> 36:41.047
and singing You'll Never Walk Alone.

36:41.515 --> 36:45.178
Now she was back in Flint,
offering advice to the unemployed.

36:45.253 --> 36:48.552
Opportunities are still in Flint, Michigan.
They're still in America.

36:48.623 --> 36:50.523
Hang in there. Take a day at a time.

36:50.925 --> 36:53.325
Go forward and be positive about life.

36:53.394 --> 36:57.626
Don't feel regretful or guilty
about the past, or worry about the future.

36:57.698 --> 36:59.563
You have today. Today's a new day.

36:59.634 --> 37:02.000
It's an opportunity for you
to look about you...

37:02.069 --> 37:05.800
and look at the positive within yourself
and within your community.

37:18.319 --> 37:21.186
I read something interesting.
Margaret Thatcher says:

37:21.255 --> 37:23.917
"Cheer up, America.
You live in a great country.

37:23.991 --> 37:26.482
"You're a free country.
You have a great President.

37:26.560 --> 37:30.997
"Not everything's perfect, but cheer up,
because you live in a free America."

37:31.065 --> 37:33.090
So, we live in a free society.

37:33.167 --> 37:37.001
Today is a new day, an opportunity
to do something with yourself.

37:38.606 --> 37:42.042
If nothing else,
thank God for the sunshine...

37:42.109 --> 37:44.703
and for the fact
that you're not starving to death.

37:44.779 --> 37:48.044
Go out and do something with your hands.
I don't know.

38:02.830 --> 38:05.094
Flint is bedrock America.

38:05.900 --> 38:08.130
People here don't quit or give up.

38:08.202 --> 38:12.332
They know there've been many good times
in the past, and there's more...

38:13.174 --> 38:16.143
of good, productive time ahead.

38:21.382 --> 38:23.873
It was like I was reliving my childhood.

38:23.951 --> 38:26.351
First Anita,
and now "Mr. Chevrolet" himself.

38:26.420 --> 38:29.821
Pat Boone had arrived in Flint
just when we needed him.

38:29.890 --> 38:33.257
I look the same.
I liked you the moment I saw you.

38:34.628 --> 38:37.096
More people identified me
with Chevrolet...

38:37.164 --> 38:40.031
than any other sponsor,
and any other spokesman.

38:40.401 --> 38:43.837
Since my family was getting bigger,
we were having a baby a year...

38:43.904 --> 38:48.102
I needed a station wagon.
So each year I worked for Chevrolet...

38:48.376 --> 38:51.277
I had a Corvette
and a station wagon to use.

38:51.479 --> 38:55.643
That strengthened my feeling that this
was a great sponsor and a great product...

38:55.716 --> 38:59.447
which I could whole-heartedly endorse
on television, and did.

38:59.620 --> 39:02.248
Take a look at Chevrolet's '58 Corvette.

39:03.257 --> 39:04.747
What a beauty!

39:05.159 --> 39:09.027
I own and drive one of these myself.
I can vouch for them.

39:09.096 --> 39:11.997
The sweetest-handling baby
on the road today.

39:12.066 --> 39:16.298
Chevrolet's completely new in style.
It's the longest, too.

39:17.972 --> 39:21.237
Have you ever met Roger Smith,
the chairman of General Motors?

39:21.308 --> 39:23.538
I haven't. At least, I don't think I have.

39:23.611 --> 39:26.307
If I had, it would have been
before he was chairman...

39:26.380 --> 39:29.372
years ago, during my involvement.
I don't think we've met.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.281
So you don't know much about him?

39:31.352 --> 39:36.187
I don't know much about him. He seems
to be a very optimistic, can-do kind of guy.

39:36.824 --> 39:38.451
He's not a quitter.

39:46.400 --> 39:49.494
I knew you'd rather have a Buick.
See you later.

39:52.673 --> 39:54.834
Who's to blame
for what's happened in Flint?

39:54.909 --> 39:57.104
I don't think it's anybody's fault.

39:58.446 --> 40:02.644
In a free society,
in a capitalistic, democratic society...

40:02.716 --> 40:05.685
things do change.
There are shifts and trends.

40:06.187 --> 40:09.884
I'm sure General Motors
doesn't have any desire...

40:10.257 --> 40:13.784
to either close down a plant
or put people out of work.

40:21.168 --> 40:23.500
The key becomes the attitude.

40:23.771 --> 40:27.070
Folks wind up saying, "lt was
the best thing that happened to me...

40:27.141 --> 40:31.339
"when my job at the plant phased out.
I was only gonna go so far at the plant.

40:31.645 --> 40:34.341
"Now I've got my own business,
whatever it is."

40:35.015 --> 40:37.245
It's maybe no accident...

40:37.318 --> 40:40.810
that the Amway business, for one,
is in aid of Michigan...

40:40.888 --> 40:45.325
offering anybody, for very little money,
a chance to start earning dollars...

40:45.559 --> 40:47.083
having their own store in their home.

40:52.733 --> 40:56.669
If you have a dream, and you
go after your dream, you can do it.

40:56.737 --> 41:01.037
If you do it full-time,
you can really make good money.

41:01.108 --> 41:03.474
You can make a lot of money off of these.

41:03.544 --> 41:07.537
Janet was one of hundreds of
Flint's citizens who had taken Pat's advice.

41:07.615 --> 41:09.947
Although her husband
was still working at GM...

41:10.017 --> 41:13.885
she'd seen many of her friends laid off,
and didn't want to take any chances.

41:13.954 --> 41:17.185
She'd been the founder and host
of Flint's feminist radio show.

41:17.258 --> 41:19.658
Now she was a distributor for Amway.

41:19.727 --> 41:21.661
Color is my main love.

41:21.729 --> 41:26.598
I got color-analyzed myself a couple
of years prior to learning color consulting.

41:27.001 --> 41:29.868
As soon as I found out
what season I was...

41:29.970 --> 41:34.498
it changed my outlook. I went around
draping everyone with my eyes.

41:34.575 --> 41:37.738
I really wanted to get into this business.
It was exciting to me.

41:37.811 --> 41:41.611
About 80 percent of the world's population
is winter or summer.

41:41.682 --> 41:45.982
Blacks, Jews, ltalians
most often are winters.

41:47.254 --> 41:49.984
I start with the orange and pink drape.

41:50.224 --> 41:53.387
The reason is
because I want to put you into a family:

41:53.460 --> 41:55.553
the warm family or the cool family.

41:55.629 --> 41:59.326
People who are warm
have a yellow undertone to their skin.

42:01.035 --> 42:03.629
The orange drape
brings the yellow undertone out...

42:03.704 --> 42:05.467
and makes them look really good.

42:05.739 --> 42:09.038
If you put orange
on someone who has a blue undertone...

42:09.109 --> 42:12.237
which would be the pink, or cool, family...

42:12.813 --> 42:16.476
then their face will get real pale...

42:16.550 --> 42:18.245
or they'll look real tired...

42:18.319 --> 42:21.117
or they'll get a lot of ruddiness
come out on their face.

42:21.188 --> 42:24.646
So I like to put what I think
is the wrong color on you first...

42:25.226 --> 42:27.490
then I can compare it to the right color.

42:27.561 --> 42:30.724
That way it will really improve
how you look.

42:32.499 --> 42:35.935
What usually happens
is what I'm seeing happen to her.

42:36.437 --> 42:38.997
She gets jaundice
when you put orange on her.

42:39.073 --> 42:42.270
She turns yellow, looks a little bit sickly.

42:42.576 --> 42:46.569
You might not even see it that much now,
but let's compare it to the pink.

42:55.022 --> 42:57.513
I get a small commission
on every account.

42:59.727 --> 43:03.026
Join up and find out. It's good!

43:03.597 --> 43:06.327
Three months after we attended
Janet's Amway meeting...

43:06.400 --> 43:08.925
she phoned in a panic
and asked that we come back...

43:09.003 --> 43:10.868
as she'd made a terrible mistake.

43:10.938 --> 43:14.840
I've very recently learned
that I am not an autumn.

43:14.908 --> 43:18.400
I was color-analyzed
by someone in the lMS line...

43:18.479 --> 43:20.777
who are the people
who taught me to do colors.

43:20.848 --> 43:23.408
I've discovered that I am another season.

43:23.484 --> 43:26.647
It's a warm season, like autumn,
but it's spring instead.

43:26.720 --> 43:30.315
The colors that I wear
are basically the same color family...

43:30.658 --> 43:33.354
but they're lighter and brighter.

43:33.427 --> 43:36.225
It's really a shock to me,
because I am out there...

43:36.297 --> 43:39.460
color-analyzing women all the time.
Little did I know...

43:39.533 --> 43:43.162
that I was not the season
that I was telling people I was.

43:44.171 --> 43:48.403
I felt sorry for Janet.
So, to cheer her up, I let her do my colors.

43:48.475 --> 43:51.205
As it turned out,
we were the same season.

43:54.448 --> 43:56.973
There were other ways to survive in Flint.

43:57.251 --> 43:59.014
Taco Bell was one.

43:59.219 --> 44:02.086
The local Taco Bell
was retraining laid-off auto workers...

44:02.156 --> 44:04.750
to assemble tacos and chicken fajitas.

44:04.825 --> 44:07.055
The local paper said
this would be their dream job.

44:08.662 --> 44:10.789
When I stopped by to see
how they were doing...

44:10.864 --> 44:14.356
the manager told me
why all the ex-GM workers had been fired.

44:16.870 --> 44:19.532
Many of them say
this is a lot of hard work...

44:19.606 --> 44:23.474
because assembly work is easy.
It depends on what you make it.

44:23.877 --> 44:26.573
At Taco Bell, every day's a new day.

44:26.814 --> 44:29.476
Every time you turn around,
it's a different challenge.

44:29.583 --> 44:31.574
-Taco Light.
-One Taco Light.

44:32.252 --> 44:36.279
-Would you like Cinnamon Crispas?
-Yeah, you make it sound so good.

44:36.357 --> 44:37.449
Dining here today?

44:38.359 --> 44:41.453
Fast food is one of the most
stressful environments...

44:41.528 --> 44:43.496
because of the demands on you.

44:43.931 --> 44:46.331
Fast food demands a fast pace...

44:46.400 --> 44:48.925
because we want to present a food item...

44:49.403 --> 44:51.803
within so many seconds, if we can do it.

44:52.473 --> 44:57.376
The transaction from assembly work
and the fast pace at Taco Bell....

44:58.145 --> 45:01.137
Some of them
just couldn't develop that speed.

45:01.849 --> 45:06.047
There's a number of small manufacturing
companies that have done very well.

45:07.187 --> 45:11.089
One I like to look at is Helmac Co.
Are you familiar with them?

45:11.158 --> 45:13.058
They invented a lint roller.

45:13.127 --> 45:15.789
Now they ship lint rollers
all over the world...

45:15.863 --> 45:19.765
and have a very profitable,
nice business operating.

45:21.869 --> 45:23.598
Maybe there's a....

45:24.037 --> 45:27.632
-There's all kinds of opportunities--
-Tom, wait a minute.

45:28.742 --> 45:32.303
Lint rollers?
That's the solution to an auto industry--

45:32.379 --> 45:33.641
That's an example.

45:33.714 --> 45:36.911
A giant auto industry
that had its birthplace here in Flint?

45:36.984 --> 45:40.147
Lint rollers will pull us
out of this depression?

45:40.220 --> 45:42.654
There's as much opportunity here...

45:42.723 --> 45:46.819
as when Billy Durant started
the motor company on Water Street.

45:46.894 --> 45:48.361
Maybe more opportunities.

45:48.429 --> 45:50.920
-You believe that?
-Yes, I do. Absolutely.

46:10.350 --> 46:12.875
I saw the sign down on the street...

46:12.953 --> 46:16.047
that said you're selling
rabbits and bunnies here?

46:16.824 --> 46:19.122
-For sale?
-You want pets or meat?

46:19.193 --> 46:20.490
Pets or meat?

46:20.561 --> 46:25.191
Meaning I can buy the bunnies
to have as a pet...

46:25.899 --> 46:28.527
or I can buy them for....

46:28.602 --> 46:31.093
Meat. They're already dressed
and cleaned.

46:31.171 --> 46:34.766
I butcher the babies
when they are four or five months old.

46:34.842 --> 46:36.241
That's good.

46:36.310 --> 46:38.744
If you butcher the older ones,
like these guys...

46:38.812 --> 46:41.747
then they're stewers. They're not fryers.

46:41.815 --> 46:44.841
A lot of people like fryers
better than they do the stewers.

46:44.918 --> 46:48.513
-That makes sense.
-So I keep my personal stock.

46:48.689 --> 46:53.092
When my babies get four or five
months old, and I have 15 to 20 babies...

46:53.360 --> 46:55.453
you've got to get rid of them some way.

46:55.529 --> 46:59.363
If they don't sell as pets,
you got to get rid of them as meat.

46:59.900 --> 47:01.697
Them guys are all meat.

47:02.336 --> 47:06.102
-See, they start doing this to each other.
-What's that?

47:06.173 --> 47:09.233
Peeing on each other and stuff like that,
when they get older.

47:09.309 --> 47:13.712
If you don't have separate cages for them,
then they start fighting.

47:13.780 --> 47:16.578
Then the males castrate the other males.

47:17.117 --> 47:21.383
They do. They chew their balls right off.
Then you have a bloody mess.

47:22.055 --> 47:25.354
That's why you got to butcher them
when they're a certain age...

47:25.425 --> 47:27.256
or you have a heck of a mess.

47:27.661 --> 47:29.526
I'm on social security.

47:29.596 --> 47:33.259
The only other income I have
is my rabbits...

47:33.500 --> 47:36.025
for groceries, bills, and my dogs.

47:36.103 --> 47:38.128
I also raise Doberman pinschers.

47:39.172 --> 47:42.039
Because sometimes
I only make $10 to $15 a week...

47:42.109 --> 47:46.546
but that's better than nothing. At least
I can buy $10 to $15 worth of groceries.

47:47.014 --> 47:50.142
'Cause you only get paid once a month
from social security...

47:51.418 --> 47:53.045
and that's not very much.

48:00.260 --> 48:03.252
It's really popular.
A lot of people come down here.

48:03.330 --> 48:04.991
Usually some people come down.

48:05.065 --> 48:09.001
They're only open on Mondays, Tuesdays,
Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays.

48:09.069 --> 48:11.060
Saturday and Sunday, they're closed.

48:11.138 --> 48:13.402
On the holidays, they get...

48:13.473 --> 48:16.874
Iike, $1 to $2 bonus here and there.

48:17.578 --> 48:21.912
If you're doing this every day,
isn't your arm filled with needle marks?

48:22.749 --> 48:25.081
They only keep it in one certain spot.

48:26.086 --> 48:28.919
You keep it right there. Doesn't look bad.

48:28.989 --> 48:32.789
I take some rubbing alcohol
to get the scar tissue to heal up.

48:32.859 --> 48:34.292
Can we see it?

48:35.796 --> 48:37.764
I only do it in my right arm.

48:38.765 --> 48:40.357
It's not so bad.

48:41.068 --> 48:44.868
They only do it in a certain place,
in a certain spot.

48:46.673 --> 48:48.197
It's right here.

48:48.275 --> 48:51.335
They don't track it up.
They only do it in two places.

48:56.383 --> 48:58.613
No! My baby!

48:59.052 --> 49:00.314
Oh, God!

49:00.387 --> 49:02.878
Flint is best known
for its principal industry.

49:02.956 --> 49:06.050
But it's quickly gaining notoriety
as a major crime center.

49:06.126 --> 49:08.594
It's a record year for homicides
in the Vehicle City.

49:08.662 --> 49:12.428
According to the FBI, Flint now has
the highest violent crime rate in America.

49:12.499 --> 49:15.093
...crime rate is one of the highest
on the continent.

49:15.168 --> 49:18.262
A big part of the problem
is there aren't enough jail cells...

49:18.338 --> 49:19.999
for all the criminals.

49:30.751 --> 49:33.845
-I got it.
-I don't think that target would have lived.

49:34.021 --> 49:36.114
I got two out of the ring there.

49:36.189 --> 49:38.919
-You got three out the ring, son.
-Yes, sir.

49:39.693 --> 49:41.422
Where is my third one?

49:42.329 --> 49:45.662
Here's two here.
Where's the third one out of the ring?

49:45.732 --> 49:47.529
Okay, that one's out of the ring.

49:47.601 --> 49:50.161
Your biggest problem
is your barrel length.

49:50.303 --> 49:54.831
We usually tell them that probably
their best protection for home...

49:55.175 --> 49:57.735
is the short-barreled shotgun.

49:59.846 --> 50:02.747
-Why is that?
-It's easy to handle...

50:04.184 --> 50:07.017
and if you do have to shoot,
you're not liable to miss.

50:08.488 --> 50:11.651
And when they hear that pump gun...

50:11.958 --> 50:15.485
when you rack that,
there's no other sound like it.

50:15.562 --> 50:17.826
Usually you don't have to fire it.

50:17.898 --> 50:21.629
They get moving pretty fast.
They'll move away.

50:21.935 --> 50:23.493
They don't like the sound.

50:23.570 --> 50:25.231
They know exactly what you have.

50:25.305 --> 50:27.671
You don't have to say,
"l have a gun in my hand."

50:27.741 --> 50:30.107
They know it'll really tear them up.

50:32.479 --> 50:35.380
With higher unemployment
creating more crime in Flint...

50:35.449 --> 50:39.749
General Motors and the United Auto
Workers' union came up with a novel idea.

50:39.820 --> 50:44.223
Train the ex-auto workers to be prison
guards and give them jobs in the jails...

50:44.291 --> 50:46.851
now filling up
with their former line mates.

50:46.927 --> 50:49.987
It's kind of sad in a way
to see somebody that you know...

50:50.063 --> 50:52.793
or had done something with
on the outside being in jail...

50:52.866 --> 50:55.664
or sentenced to prison
or something like that.

50:57.204 --> 51:00.731
But I guess it's, you know....
The theory goes, you play, you pay.

51:01.575 --> 51:03.065
And you get over it.

51:03.343 --> 51:05.573
I'd have a possibility to move on.

51:05.779 --> 51:08.907
That's what this 160-hour program
was all about.

51:09.382 --> 51:13.682
I have a certificate now, stating that
I can apply anywhere in the United States.

51:13.854 --> 51:15.845
The money's not an object right now.

51:15.922 --> 51:19.358
If I can improve myself, morally,
the money will come later.

51:19.559 --> 51:22.653
It's almost half
of what I was making at General Motors...

51:22.729 --> 51:25.994
-but I like the work a lot better.
-You'll do what?

51:26.133 --> 51:27.225
It's not as hot.

51:27.300 --> 51:30.701
You don't scare me by saying that.
I'll screw your fucking ass!

51:30.771 --> 51:33.604
I don't care what you think! I'll screw you!

51:33.740 --> 51:36.937
You'll cope with me in a few days,
I'm telling you that now!

51:37.010 --> 51:39.740
You don't scare me! I know my rights!

51:39.813 --> 51:42.281
-I went to school, okay?
-What's going on?

51:43.183 --> 51:46.050
Someone in a heated discussion
down there, I guess.

51:46.953 --> 51:49.683
I'm going to jump you! I'll get you, man!

51:51.658 --> 51:54.593
...a staff member is a violation of that rule.

51:54.661 --> 51:57.357
I don't respect you!

51:57.430 --> 51:59.921
When you give me respect, I'll respect you.

52:00.300 --> 52:02.097
-Take it easy.
-I know my rights!

52:08.508 --> 52:12.137
I really don't know the answer.
I feel sorry for people...

52:12.712 --> 52:17.046
but you can't help them. I mean,
you have such a good welfare program.

52:17.484 --> 52:19.782
So, they just don't want to work.

52:19.853 --> 52:23.084
I don't think so. I really don't know.

52:25.292 --> 52:27.260
-Good shot.
-That's nice.

52:27.761 --> 52:32.221
All four of us have always lived in Flint
and gone to school here.

52:34.801 --> 52:36.291
We just love it so.

52:37.404 --> 52:41.602
-What do you love about it?
-I personally love our friends, you know.

52:43.977 --> 52:46.775
And we like our club, and we like...

52:48.348 --> 52:49.975
all the stores and...

52:50.283 --> 52:52.217
you know, what's left of them.

52:57.858 --> 52:59.519
I think everybody should...

53:01.228 --> 53:05.130
try to find another job, or do
something else in training, or something.

53:06.633 --> 53:09.101
You think a lot of people are being lazy?

53:09.369 --> 53:10.927
I think some of them.

53:11.004 --> 53:14.633
I think a lot of them
take the easy way out.

53:23.783 --> 53:25.978
Judge issued the order
to vacate the house.

53:26.052 --> 53:27.679
-Right now?
-Yes, ma'am.

53:27.888 --> 53:30.823
Okay, that's the least he can do.
I'll go get a truck.

53:30.891 --> 53:32.552
-Today?
-Right now.

53:33.226 --> 53:35.251
Can't you wait till we get a truck?

53:35.328 --> 53:38.229
You can get the truck,
but they got a crew on the way here.

53:38.298 --> 53:42.257
They stopped at the store to get a pop.
I'd get dressed if I was you.

53:42.535 --> 53:44.332
We got to vacate the house.

53:46.573 --> 53:50.065
We're doing more evictions,
more repossessions, and everything...

53:50.143 --> 53:52.043
way behind, trying to catch up.

53:52.445 --> 53:56.643
A lot of these people bought
school clothes and didn't pay the rent.

53:57.617 --> 53:59.585
The system 's got to change...

53:59.653 --> 54:03.487
because if they didn't have enough money
to pay rent and buy clothes...

54:03.556 --> 54:05.581
they're in trouble, anyway.

54:06.326 --> 54:10.763
I've put out some of my best friends,
but it's nothing personal, you know.

54:12.365 --> 54:15.129
They know me, they know what I do, so....

54:16.469 --> 54:18.994
If they're lucky enough to draw me...

54:19.072 --> 54:21.063
at least they got somebody to talk to.

54:21.207 --> 54:22.196
What?

54:37.624 --> 54:41.583
These people couldn't find a truck.
They called two or three different places.

54:41.661 --> 54:44.129
They called U-Haul...

54:44.197 --> 54:47.360
and they said all their trucks
were out for today.

54:47.567 --> 54:51.435
They called Ryder Truck, and they said
all of theirs were out for today.

54:51.504 --> 54:55.668
A gentleman came by, we hauled him
down, and he didn't want to get involved.

54:55.742 --> 54:59.178
So now I assume they're on the phone,
trying to get a trailer...

54:59.245 --> 55:02.339
from Mark's Trailer Rental
up on Carpenter Road.

55:02.549 --> 55:05.109
Why are all the trucks being rented here?

55:05.518 --> 55:07.509
People are probably moving.

55:11.358 --> 55:15.294
With GM closing,
there are so many people leaving town.

55:15.362 --> 55:17.956
We've handled
over 82,000 address changes.

55:18.031 --> 55:21.558
We're having a lot of people
just abandon their house sometimes.

55:21.868 --> 55:24.132
Thank God we're getting
new equipment here.

55:24.204 --> 55:28.470
We're getting new higher-tech computers
that will be able to process more mail.

55:29.109 --> 55:31.703
I don't foresee this job evaporating.

55:32.145 --> 55:34.170
I feel we're secure in forwarding mail.

55:34.647 --> 55:37.514
Usually we see somebody every day
that we know...

55:38.418 --> 55:40.443
that's moved on, left town.

55:40.520 --> 55:43.045
A lot of people are looking
for work elsewhere.

55:43.123 --> 55:47.526
My husband's currently laid off, and we're
giving some thought to it ourselves.

55:47.761 --> 55:49.251
The GM layoff.

55:51.131 --> 55:53.622
We have been having so many trucks...

55:53.700 --> 55:55.998
go one-way to places like Florida...

55:56.069 --> 55:58.799
and places south of here.

55:59.139 --> 56:03.405
We have a very hard time
keeping trucks in the Flint area.

56:03.910 --> 56:08.040
It's expected we'll get some
of our fleet back towards midsummer...

56:08.548 --> 56:11.915
but with the layoffs coming heavier...

56:12.352 --> 56:15.321
it's going to be very hard
to keep a truck around here.

56:28.768 --> 56:31.601
I continued to dog Roger
all over the country.

56:31.805 --> 56:34.000
From Detroit to Chicago...

56:34.574 --> 56:37.065
to Washington, D.C., to New York City.

56:37.143 --> 56:41.011
I followed a trail of three-martini lunches
in pursuit of the chairman.

56:41.748 --> 56:45.650
I finally found Roger at the
Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York City...

56:45.985 --> 56:49.011
where he was getting an award
for the car of the year.

56:50.657 --> 56:52.716
We weren't in the hotel five minutes...

56:52.792 --> 56:55.317
when GM security recognized
one of our crew members...

56:55.395 --> 56:58.489
as a relative of their arch nemesis,
Ralph Nader.

56:59.099 --> 57:01.067
They called the New York City police
and carried him out...

57:02.102 --> 57:04.866
chair and all,
down to precinct headquarters.

57:07.740 --> 57:11.005
As soon as I could,
I headed to Detroit to Roger's office...

57:11.077 --> 57:14.843
where I was determined this time
to get on to the 14th floor.

57:22.021 --> 57:23.352
Excuse me.

57:25.959 --> 57:29.759
-Where are you guys going?
-We're going up to the 14th floor.

57:29.896 --> 57:32.956
-Do you have an appointment?
-We're going to see Roger Smith.

57:33.032 --> 57:36.092
No, you're not. You're not getting
on one of those elevators.

57:36.169 --> 57:39.570
-Why's that?
-You're not going without an appointment.

57:39.639 --> 57:41.971
Can we go up
and try making an appointment?

57:42.041 --> 57:43.099
Why?

57:44.043 --> 57:45.374
I need Tony or Denise.

57:46.379 --> 57:50.042
-The reason to talk to Roger Smith?
-Michael Moore.

57:50.416 --> 57:53.112
No, what's your reason
for seeing Roger Smith?

57:53.186 --> 57:56.314
-Excuse me. I need to see you.
-We're making a film....

58:03.730 --> 58:05.698
I quickly sized up the situation:

58:05.765 --> 58:08.791
three guards in the booth,
plus the one with the corsage...

58:08.868 --> 58:10.495
a dozen security cameras...

58:10.570 --> 58:14.597
and four new cars with inflated
sticker prices parked in the lobby.

58:14.674 --> 58:18.770
If I made a run for it to Roger's office,
what's the worst that could happen?

58:18.878 --> 58:22.211
Before I could fully explore
the consequences of such an action...

58:22.282 --> 58:25.740
my escorts to the 14th floor finally arrived.

58:26.119 --> 58:28.781
Mr. Smith is not in at the present time.

58:28.855 --> 58:33.554
We'd be happy to take your request under
advisement, as with all appointments.

58:33.626 --> 58:37.790
I've been told that before. I've called,
written, and I've been here before.

58:37.864 --> 58:39.798
-Have you written?
-Yes, I've written.

58:39.866 --> 58:42.562
-To whom?
-To Roger Smith...

58:43.002 --> 58:46.665
General Motors building,
Grand Avenue, Detroit, Michigan.

58:46.973 --> 58:49.373
John, how about we have a letter
sent to your office?

58:49.442 --> 58:51.774
Why don't you send a letter to us...

58:51.844 --> 58:54.836
and we will be happy to,
as I say, take it under advisement...

58:54.914 --> 58:57.280
just as we do all requests
to see the chairman.

58:57.350 --> 59:01.184
It's just that I've been waiting for a year
to get this.

59:01.254 --> 59:03.722
It's been under advisement for a long time.

59:03.790 --> 59:07.021
What I'd like to do
is just go up to the 14th floor...

59:07.126 --> 59:09.321
and set up an appointment
with his secretary.

59:09.395 --> 59:11.386
That would be impossible.

59:11.731 --> 59:14.393
Obviously, I was getting
the big blowoff once again.

59:16.202 --> 59:19.035
Meanwhile, things weren't getting better
back in Flint.

59:19.105 --> 59:21.039
More jobs had been eliminated.

59:21.107 --> 59:24.372
The city had become
the unemployment capital of the country.

59:25.078 --> 59:27.945
The visits from the stars
and the creation of new jobs...

59:28.014 --> 59:30.710
had failed to pull Flint
out of its depression.

59:31.684 --> 59:34.448
Just when it appeared
that all hope was lost...

59:34.621 --> 59:37.818
the city fathers came up
with one last great idea.

59:39.259 --> 59:43.025
You don't usually think of
tourist attraction when you think of Flint...

59:43.162 --> 59:45.756
but people here in Flint
would like to change that.

59:45.832 --> 59:48.858
And they're willing to go
to some pretty extreme lengths.

59:48.935 --> 59:52.837
Flint officials would like to see
the local tourist economy explode.

59:55.341 --> 59:57.673
Flint's Convention and Tourism
Bureau president...

59:57.744 --> 01:00:01.703
says visitors should take advantage
of Flint's convenient location.

01:00:01.948 --> 01:00:04.382
Millions of travelers pass by our doorstep.

01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:06.975
Now, with this active
and aggressive promotion...

01:00:07.053 --> 01:00:11.854
we'll be able to draw them into our city
and experience what we have to offer.

01:00:14.627 --> 01:00:17.460
As part of the plan
to attract tourism and conventions...

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:22.331
the city spent $13 million in tax funds
to build a Hyatt Regency Hotel.

01:00:24.804 --> 01:00:28.706
Although most people in Flint were now
too poor to afford a room at the Hyatt...

01:00:28.775 --> 01:00:31.107
the hotel allowed the public
on opening day...

01:00:31.177 --> 01:00:33.702
to come and ride the city's only escalator.

01:00:34.213 --> 01:00:36.681
We put a luxury hotel
in the heart of our city...

01:00:36.749 --> 01:00:39.775
just like other cities
with their luxury hotels...

01:00:39.852 --> 01:00:43.015
with everything from the fountains
and high ceilings...

01:00:43.089 --> 01:00:46.957
the atrium lobby, to the large windows,
the large plants.

01:00:47.226 --> 01:00:49.126
The quality is there...

01:00:49.362 --> 01:00:53.128
what you would find
in Chicago, or Atlanta, or San Francisco.

01:00:53.866 --> 01:00:58.064
We've got some great facilities,
as far as places to stay...

01:00:58.304 --> 01:01:02.070
interesting places to see, museums....

01:01:02.275 --> 01:01:05.676
And it's a nice community to visit.

01:01:18.358 --> 01:01:20.349
Meet Mr. and Mrs. Roberts.

01:01:20.426 --> 01:01:22.553
They're two of the thousands of people...

01:01:22.628 --> 01:01:25.859
who decide to spend some time
at Genesee County each year.

01:01:26.199 --> 01:01:28.463
There's the sign. We're almost there.

01:01:28.534 --> 01:01:31.628
I can hardly wait to see some of the places
in the brochures.

01:01:31.704 --> 01:01:34.104
Let's pull off and fill up first.

01:01:34.741 --> 01:01:37.107
-You from out of town?
-Yeah, we're on vacation.

01:01:37.176 --> 01:01:39.269
Welcome to Flint. You staying here?

01:01:39.345 --> 01:01:41.245
Yeah, we are. Lots to do?

01:01:41.314 --> 01:01:45.273
Sure, there's lots of attractions here.
Have you seen Crossroads Village?

01:01:45.351 --> 01:01:49.412
See how a little hospitality, right
from the start, really makes a difference?

01:01:49.489 --> 01:01:52.583
Suggesting things to see and do
builds our own image...

01:01:52.925 --> 01:01:55.951
and it creates
positive word-of-mouth endorsements...

01:01:56.028 --> 01:02:00.192
the most inexpensive, yet most valuable
type of advertising there is.

01:02:00.366 --> 01:02:03.927
Once again, you see our slogan:
"Flint: our new spark will surprise you."

01:02:04.003 --> 01:02:05.630
Capturing a lot of enthusiasm.

01:02:05.705 --> 01:02:09.766
Letting people know there are some
new and surprising things in the Flint area.

01:02:09.842 --> 01:02:13.972
This is our visitors' log book.
I see West Germany here, Australia.

01:02:14.847 --> 01:02:18.442
Jackie, what are some of the things
that visitors ask us?

01:02:18.518 --> 01:02:20.816
First off, "Where is the bathroom?"

01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:23.384
That's the question I get asked most.

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:26.519
Then, "What is there to do in Flint?"

01:02:29.562 --> 01:02:32.793
The city had a hard time attracting
major conventions to the Hyatt.

01:02:32.865 --> 01:02:37.063
It settled for groups like the Michigan
Ready Mix Concrete Association...

01:02:37.136 --> 01:02:40.037
and the statewide organization
of Scrabble players.

01:02:40.239 --> 01:02:44.005
On this last game,
I made a seven-letter word, "partier."

01:02:44.076 --> 01:02:46.169
P-A-R-T-l-E-R.

01:02:46.579 --> 01:02:50.606
So we looked in the Scrabble bible,
which is this dictionary...

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:52.750
and it isn't allowed there.

01:02:52.819 --> 01:02:56.186
They allow "partied," P-A-R-T-l-E-D...

01:02:56.522 --> 01:02:59.423
and "parties," P-A-R-T-l-E-S...

01:02:59.525 --> 01:03:02.688
but no "partier."
So don't claim you are one ever.

01:03:05.832 --> 01:03:08.164
Flint's leaders needed more tourists.

01:03:08.234 --> 01:03:11.499
They hired the company that built
New York's South Street Seaport...

01:03:11.571 --> 01:03:14.540
to come to Flint
and create Water Street Pavilion.

01:03:15.942 --> 01:03:18.740
We took a four-square-block area,
tore it down...

01:03:18.811 --> 01:03:21.245
and built this new facility...

01:03:21.314 --> 01:03:24.613
which is a lot of glass and steel,
as well as plants...

01:03:25.485 --> 01:03:29.387
and different colors
to make it festive, fun and exciting.

01:03:29.455 --> 01:03:31.719
Also, a major parking ramp...

01:03:31.791 --> 01:03:35.454
and some other facilities
connected with the building.

01:03:35.528 --> 01:03:39.157
It's more than just another building
in downtown Flint.

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:43.965
I like the color and the excitement of it.
It's very good for tourism in our area.

01:03:44.036 --> 01:03:47.494
A major stop for the bus tours
that come to our area.

01:03:47.673 --> 01:03:52.372
They pull up, park the bus,
and unload 40 senior citizens or so.

01:03:53.179 --> 01:03:57.673
Water Street brings a fun atmosphere
that comes with a festival marketplace...

01:03:57.884 --> 01:04:00.944
much like other festival marketplaces
around the country.

01:04:01.521 --> 01:04:05.548
But the crowning jewel in Flint's plan
to attract tourists was AutoWorld...

01:04:05.625 --> 01:04:09.459
hailed by city officials
as the world's largest indoor theme park.

01:04:09.762 --> 01:04:12.128
Today is the first day...

01:04:12.665 --> 01:04:14.064
of the rebirth...

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.698
of the great city of Flint.

01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:19.997
The governor had reason to be excited.

01:04:20.072 --> 01:04:23.269
Donny and Marie had come
to celebrate the opening of AutoWorld...

01:04:23.342 --> 01:04:26.277
constructed at a cost
of over $100 million...

01:04:26.512 --> 01:04:30.175
and dedicated to the belief
that the automobile made America great.

01:04:32.852 --> 01:04:36.686
I paid my $8.95 and saw something
I hadn't seen in a long time...

01:04:36.756 --> 01:04:39.520
downtown Flint, rebuilt exactly to scale...

01:04:39.592 --> 01:04:41.856
under the glass-enclosed dome
of AutoWorld...

01:04:41.928 --> 01:04:44.863
to look like it used to
before the factory closings.

01:04:46.666 --> 01:04:48.998
They predicted
a million tourists would come...

01:04:49.068 --> 01:04:51.832
to ride the world's only
indoor Ferris wheel...

01:04:51.904 --> 01:04:54.464
to gaze at the world's largest car engine...

01:04:54.907 --> 01:04:58.138
and to meet the official sponsors
of the American dream.

01:04:59.412 --> 01:05:02.313
My favorite was the exhibit sponsored
by General Motors.

01:05:02.381 --> 01:05:03.712
A puppet auto worker...

01:05:03.783 --> 01:05:07.275
singing a love song to the robot
replacing him on the assembly line.

01:05:07.353 --> 01:05:09.548
The song was called Me and My Buddy.

01:05:15.628 --> 01:05:18.324
AutoWorld will make
a major contribution...

01:05:18.931 --> 01:05:22.025
to our important
tourism and travel industry.

01:05:22.902 --> 01:05:26.099
It's not only a contribution to that,
but as the mayor said:

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:30.006
"To jobs for our people,
our children, our neighbors."

01:05:32.044 --> 01:05:34.569
The million tourists never came to Flint.

01:05:35.147 --> 01:05:37.945
The Hyatt went bankrupt
and was put up for sale.

01:05:38.451 --> 01:05:42.410
Water Street Pavilion saw
most of its stores go out of business.

01:05:43.723 --> 01:05:45.918
And, only six months after opening...

01:05:45.992 --> 01:05:48.893
AutoWorld closed due to a lack of visitors.

01:05:50.129 --> 01:05:52.962
I guess it was like
expecting a million people a year...

01:05:53.032 --> 01:05:57.867
to go to New Jersey to ChemicalWorld,
or to Valdez, Alaska, to ExxonWorld.

01:05:58.604 --> 01:06:02.631
Some people just don't like to celebrate
human tragedy while on vacation.

01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:05.840
It started to get looking like Toronto...

01:06:05.945 --> 01:06:08.379
upper middle-class
black and white people...

01:06:08.447 --> 01:06:10.574
and everybody was dressed nice.

01:06:10.816 --> 01:06:14.650
We thought it would be
the entertainment center of the county...

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.518
in all truth.
That may be naive, but that was my goal.

01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:20.024
Let's make it the entertainment center...

01:06:20.092 --> 01:06:23.186
so that everybody wants to be
in downtown Flint.

01:06:23.262 --> 01:06:25.787
We're going to have
entertainment and art.

01:06:25.865 --> 01:06:29.062
It's going to be very cultural,
it going to be very upbeat.

01:06:29.135 --> 01:06:32.002
Somebody said something to me,
and maybe it's true.

01:06:32.338 --> 01:06:34.738
They said, "Look, Maxine...

01:06:36.575 --> 01:06:39.976
"you can't make Palm Beach
out of the Bowery.

01:06:40.846 --> 01:06:43.337
"You want to make Palm Beach,
you got to go there."

01:06:45.017 --> 01:06:48.885
Half of Flint was now receiving
some form of government welfare.

01:06:49.388 --> 01:06:52.846
Meanwhile, Roger Smith
gave himself a $2,000,000 raise.

01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:55.819
GM lobbyist Tom Kay tried to explain.

01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:58.893
I don't understand your connection,
that by saying...

01:06:58.964 --> 01:07:03.094
because General Motors was born here,
it owes more to this community.

01:07:03.169 --> 01:07:05.103
-I don't agree with that.
-Why not?

01:07:05.171 --> 01:07:08.299
Because I just don't agree with it.
I believe it's a corporation.

01:07:08.374 --> 01:07:12.401
It's in business to make a profit.
It does what it has to do to make a profit.

01:07:12.812 --> 01:07:15.872
That's the nature of corporations
or companies.

01:07:16.082 --> 01:07:20.485
It's why people take their own money
and invest it in a business...

01:07:20.586 --> 01:07:22.019
so they can make money.

01:07:22.088 --> 01:07:24.556
It isn't to honor their hometown.

01:07:49.782 --> 01:07:51.044
What's going on here?

01:07:51.617 --> 01:07:54.279
They're evicting somebody from his home.

01:07:56.622 --> 01:07:58.453
I was just wondering.

01:08:00.259 --> 01:08:04.389
It turned out that the guy Deputy Fred
was evicting had gone to my high school.

01:08:04.463 --> 01:08:05.987
His name was James Bond.

01:08:06.065 --> 01:08:08.329
As if that hadn't
caused him enough grief...

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.561
he was now being thrown out of his home.

01:08:11.070 --> 01:08:12.867
Where can I go to stay?

01:08:12.938 --> 01:08:17.272
We had five kids
at the place where I was this morning.

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:19.310
And you went over there
and evicted them?

01:08:19.478 --> 01:08:21.742
-Set them out on the ground.
-Why is that?

01:08:21.913 --> 01:08:25.042
Because they didn't pay the rent.
You think I like this?

01:08:25.484 --> 01:08:27.042
I got other things to do.

01:08:27.118 --> 01:08:30.611
-You've been doing it a long time.
-It's a job.

01:08:31.991 --> 01:08:34.357
-What can I say? It's a job.
-It's a job.

01:08:34.426 --> 01:08:36.553
Somebody's got to do it.

01:08:36.796 --> 01:08:39.264
I feel sorry for the people that have kids.

01:08:39.331 --> 01:08:42.493
What will they grow up to?
What do they look forward to?

01:08:42.768 --> 01:08:46.533
-lf I was a young man, I'd keep working.
-Look out there. It's nothing.

01:08:46.604 --> 01:08:50.598
-They got a bleak future.
-I know. I worked over there for 17 years.

01:08:50.776 --> 01:08:53.301
-I quit. I worked there.
-Why did you quit?

01:08:54.913 --> 01:08:56.609
Got tired of the system.

01:08:57.049 --> 01:08:59.176
It was like a prison to me, so I quit.

01:08:59.251 --> 01:09:00.946
It was like a prison?

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:05.488
That factory played tricks on your mind.

01:09:05.591 --> 01:09:09.390
-Where are you going to stay?
-I'll probably stay at my brother's tonight.

01:09:09.461 --> 01:09:12.453
The thing is,
I don't want to stay with somebody.

01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:15.898
I want a chance
to have something of my own...

01:09:15.968 --> 01:09:18.801
which doesn't look
like it's going to happen, ever.

01:09:19.404 --> 01:09:20.736
Not in this town.

01:09:21.473 --> 01:09:23.031
These are rough times.

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:28.642
Really rough times.
I got thrown out of my house once.

01:09:31.649 --> 01:09:33.810
The health inspector came out...

01:09:33.886 --> 01:09:38.823
and told me that I was dressing my rabbits
in a unsanitary condition.

01:09:39.825 --> 01:09:42.589
So now I have to build me a building...

01:09:42.694 --> 01:09:46.290
where there's washable walls,
washable floors...

01:09:47.032 --> 01:09:49.796
and an unbreakable light.

01:09:49.868 --> 01:09:52.770
I have to have a scale
that weighs properly...

01:09:53.404 --> 01:09:57.705
and I have to have three sinks
where I dress the rabbits.

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:01.739
-What's going to happen to him?
-He's going to be eaten.

01:10:03.015 --> 01:10:05.745
He's going to be our supper
on the supper table.

01:10:06.051 --> 01:10:07.450
What's the matter?

01:10:11.924 --> 01:10:13.915
What are you guys crying about?

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:16.293
How do you slaughter them?

01:10:16.362 --> 01:10:19.263
Hung them upside-down
and stripped their fur off...

01:10:19.999 --> 01:10:21.466
and gutted them.

01:10:21.967 --> 01:10:23.127
Quit biting.

01:10:23.903 --> 01:10:25.598
And chop their heads off.

01:10:26.372 --> 01:10:27.339
Quit it.

01:10:27.406 --> 01:10:30.170
What happened to your brother
who worked at the factory?

01:10:30.242 --> 01:10:31.834
He got laid off.

01:10:47.593 --> 01:10:49.788
Now you know what I'm talking about.

01:10:50.062 --> 01:10:51.324
He's dripping.

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.969
My girlfriend out in Fenton, we tan them...

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:05.304
and we try to make coats,
gloves and animals out of the furs.

01:11:05.377 --> 01:11:08.505
-What kind of coat does rabbit fur make?
-A rabbit coat.

01:11:10.249 --> 01:11:13.616
-What else do you think it makes?
-ls it a nice coat? Warm?

01:11:14.219 --> 01:11:17.518
I don't know. We ain't made one yet.
We got to get enough furs.

01:11:17.589 --> 01:11:20.319
-How many do you need?
-A lot.

01:11:22.061 --> 01:11:24.291
You need lots and lots of furs.

01:11:24.863 --> 01:11:28.299
Right now, we've only got 135 furs...

01:11:29.101 --> 01:11:31.592
with all the rabbits I've done so far...

01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:33.599
before I got in trouble.

01:11:35.374 --> 01:11:38.400
That's why I'm not actually
supposed to be doing this.

01:11:43.916 --> 01:11:46.908
I was brought up to learn to survive.

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:50.050
If you were out in the wilderness....

01:11:50.289 --> 01:11:52.189
I'm getting ready to gut him.

01:11:53.258 --> 01:11:56.159
You think it's hard
to survive in Flint these days?

01:11:59.465 --> 01:12:00.489
Why?

01:12:00.733 --> 01:12:04.328
The shops are all going down,
and people just ain't...

01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:07.703
got the money like they used to anymore...

01:12:08.273 --> 01:12:10.264
and you can't be buying things.

01:12:10.376 --> 01:12:13.573
That's why I said
my rabbit meat usually went....

01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:16.814
The people of Flint
had been through the wringer.

01:12:16.882 --> 01:12:18.474
Then came the lowest blow.

01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:22.646
Money magazine declared Flint
the worst place to live in all the country.

01:12:22.988 --> 01:12:26.890
The chamber of commerce and local
beer distributors decided to take a stand.

01:12:26.959 --> 01:12:28.950
They would burn Money magazine.

01:12:29.261 --> 01:12:32.890
I came to burn Money magazine,
because Flint's my adopted city.

01:12:32.965 --> 01:12:35.866
I've lived in plenty of cities,
and this is one of the best.

01:12:35.934 --> 01:12:39.529
There's plenty of things to do.
The economy isn't that bad off.

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:43.132
We're all hard workers and survivors,
and I support Flint.

01:12:43.675 --> 01:12:46.166
This is to tell people
that Flint is our hometown.

01:12:46.245 --> 01:12:50.773
There's no way on God's green earth
it's the worst place to live in the country.

01:12:50.949 --> 01:12:54.817
A lot of people say
there's nothing to do in Flint. "Ha! " I say.

01:12:56.922 --> 01:13:01.018
I mean, how many cities
have their own PGA Tour event?

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:04.654
Not that many. We have one right here.

01:13:04.863 --> 01:13:08.196
How many cities have an air show
the size we have?

01:13:09.334 --> 01:13:13.293
How many people have parks,
rivers and trees...

01:13:13.439 --> 01:13:16.704
and huge colleges like this over here?
Not that many.

01:13:16.775 --> 01:13:19.869
We've got a lot going for us,
and don't ever forget it.

01:13:21.013 --> 01:13:23.379
One good way to start out
would be with a song...

01:13:23.449 --> 01:13:26.213
about another industrial city
that has seen hard times.

01:13:26.285 --> 01:13:30.187
The Boss, Bruce Springsteen,
singing a song about his hometown.

01:13:30.255 --> 01:13:32.382
Burn, Money, burn!

01:13:32.458 --> 01:13:34.392
That smells like Gary, Indiana.

01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:37.657
Don't let anybody tell you
you live in the country's worst place.

01:13:37.729 --> 01:13:38.991
They're wrong!

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:44.601
Good evening.
I'm Ted Koppel, and this is Nightline.

01:13:46.238 --> 01:13:49.730
Flint was now in the national spotlight.
The biggest event was to come...

01:13:49.808 --> 01:13:52.834
when Ted Koppel announced
he'd interview city officials live...

01:13:52.911 --> 01:13:55.311
in front of city hall, on Nightline.

01:13:56.482 --> 01:13:58.143
The trouble started--

01:14:06.325 --> 01:14:07.758
Here's what we know so far.

01:14:07.826 --> 01:14:10.727
The ABC news program Nightline
was to be broadcasted live...

01:14:10.796 --> 01:14:12.627
from in front of city hall tonight.

01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:15.895
The reason? The closing
of the historic Fisher One Plant.

01:14:15.968 --> 01:14:18.163
Apparently, moments before
the broadcast...

01:14:18.237 --> 01:14:21.832
someone got in the satellite truck
and drove it off, cables and all.

01:14:21.907 --> 01:14:25.035
Nightline has had to cancel their segment
from the city of Flint...

01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:27.374
and police are looking for a suspect.

01:14:27.446 --> 01:14:31.610
Reporting live from city hall in Flint,
I'm Barb Schroeder, TV 12 News.

01:14:33.152 --> 01:14:37.179
They caught the unemployed worker
who made off with the Nightline van.

01:14:37.256 --> 01:14:40.089
But crime in Flint continued to grow.

01:14:40.159 --> 01:14:44.061
One guy thought he was Superman's
cousin and decided to save the town.

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:48.526
He didn't get very far.

01:14:51.069 --> 01:14:53.560
He just wanted us to call him Captain Dah.

01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:57.175
He said, "You can call me Dah-Dah,"
whatever that meant.

01:14:58.877 --> 01:15:00.640
The old jail couldn't hold...

01:15:00.712 --> 01:15:03.613
the increasing number of inmates
the judges were locking up.

01:15:03.682 --> 01:15:06.378
So the county built
a new, state-of-the-art jail...

01:15:06.451 --> 01:15:09.614
that was five stories high
and filled a city block.

01:15:10.088 --> 01:15:13.353
The night before the jail was to open,
the city threw a party...

01:15:13.425 --> 01:15:16.952
where couples paid $100
to stay overnight in jail.

01:15:38.817 --> 01:15:41.615
When you first come in
from the limo ride...

01:15:41.954 --> 01:15:45.185
from the pub-crawling before you get here,
they book you...

01:15:45.257 --> 01:15:49.421
they give you a free Breathalyzer test,
and a mug shot...

01:15:49.661 --> 01:15:52.095
complete with your fingerprinting.

01:16:04.710 --> 01:16:07.736
Why do you want to spend the night
in Flint jail?

01:16:09.281 --> 01:16:12.944
-Just for the experience.
-Yes, I've never been in jail before.

01:16:28.734 --> 01:16:29.928
Eureka!

01:16:31.903 --> 01:16:33.131
Let's fight.

01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:37.472
And we're having a fantastic time here.

01:16:41.179 --> 01:16:43.841
It was time to confront Roger face to face.

01:16:44.616 --> 01:16:49.178
Posing as a GM stockholder, I got into
the annual GM shareholders' meeting.

01:16:49.821 --> 01:16:53.882
I sat patiently as stockholders
aired their grievances to the board.

01:16:54.626 --> 01:16:56.651
Finally, it was my turn at the mike.

01:16:56.828 --> 01:17:00.889
Microphone number 40 is somebody
who hasn't had the opportunity to speak.

01:17:00.966 --> 01:17:03.901
Mr. Chairman, I have Mr. Michael Moore...

01:17:04.002 --> 01:17:06.232
a stockholder from Flint, Michigan.

01:17:06.371 --> 01:17:09.636
Mr. Gilbert, I wonder
if you'd like to make a motion to adjourn?

01:17:10.375 --> 01:17:12.309
I think we've answered all questions.

01:17:12.377 --> 01:17:15.107
I think everyone
has had a turn at the mike.

01:17:16.982 --> 01:17:18.244
I have one question.

01:17:18.317 --> 01:17:20.046
All right. Moved and adjourned.

01:17:20.118 --> 01:17:22.951
Thank you very much.
You've been a great audience.

01:17:23.922 --> 01:17:26.049
I thought you said Louie was here.

01:17:26.124 --> 01:17:28.285
-He's right there.
-He was sleeping.

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:32.055
He got up slow,
and didn't know what the hell to do.

01:17:34.032 --> 01:17:37.297
I think he was surprised,
for whatever reason.

01:17:37.369 --> 01:17:38.461
Me, too.

01:17:38.670 --> 01:17:42.766
I'm going to leave this stuff here, okay?
They'll pick that up and bring it?

01:17:50.048 --> 01:17:53.745
It was two weeks before Christmas.
General Motors was closing the factory...

01:17:53.819 --> 01:17:56.845
where the great Flint Sit-down Strike
had taken place.

01:17:57.322 --> 01:17:58.653
The UAW had promised...

01:17:58.724 --> 01:18:02.820
that a massive demonstration would
be held on the last day of the factory.

01:18:03.161 --> 01:18:06.722
Only four workers showed up
to protest the plant closing.

01:18:06.865 --> 01:18:09.265
This is my second one I've closed.

01:18:09.468 --> 01:18:13.768
It must be my destiny
to close all General Motors plants.

01:18:14.139 --> 01:18:18.405
It's never pleasant when something
like this comes to an end...

01:18:18.844 --> 01:18:20.778
but life goes on.

01:18:21.046 --> 01:18:22.741
What are you going to do?

01:18:22.814 --> 01:18:25.009
Excuse me a minute.
Where are you guys from?

01:18:25.083 --> 01:18:27.517
We're making a documentary
about Flint, Michigan.

01:18:27.586 --> 01:18:29.816
-From where?
-We're independent.

01:18:29.888 --> 01:18:31.651
-We'd like you off the lot.
-Why?

01:18:31.723 --> 01:18:34.988
Because this is private property.
We'd like you not to be here--

01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:39.019
We thought it was a significant day
here today. The factory's closing....

01:18:39.364 --> 01:18:41.298
It is a very significant day.

01:18:41.366 --> 01:18:44.802
It's a very sad time,
a very private, personal time.

01:18:44.903 --> 01:18:49.306
What do you think about General Motors
closing up this factory?

01:18:49.374 --> 01:18:52.309
This is a very private, emotional,
family time.

01:18:52.377 --> 01:18:56.336
-We would not let outsiders in the plant.
-We're not outsiders. We're from Flint.

01:18:56.415 --> 01:18:58.144
You are outsiders. You don't work here.

01:18:58.216 --> 01:19:00.446
This community
depends on General Motors--

01:19:00.519 --> 01:19:02.987
Jerry, this guy, out.

01:19:04.356 --> 01:19:07.848
I don't understand why we can't
talk to them for a couple minutes.

01:19:07.926 --> 01:19:11.123
This is the factory's last hour.
What's the problem?

01:19:11.463 --> 01:19:14.330
The problem is,
we were told to keep you on the sidewalk.

01:19:14.399 --> 01:19:18.665
-You're hired by GM to do that?
-That's correct. On the sidewalk, please.

01:19:19.871 --> 01:19:22.396
Mrs. McGee. There she is. Let me ask her.

01:19:22.474 --> 01:19:24.965
Why can't we talk to you
if you're the spokesperson?

01:19:25.043 --> 01:19:27.773
You can. I'll come outside and talk,
but not inside.

01:19:27.846 --> 01:19:29.313
I've asked you to leave.

01:19:29.381 --> 01:19:32.714
-We'll go, if you come and talk.
-I don't think I'll talk to you.

01:19:32.784 --> 01:19:35.878
You're the spokesperson,
and you won't speak to us.

01:19:36.154 --> 01:19:38.486
That's correct.
You don't represent anybody.

01:19:38.557 --> 01:19:41.856
You're a private interest,
and I won't speak to you.

01:19:42.594 --> 01:19:45.188
We happen to be citizens
of this community.

01:19:45.697 --> 01:19:47.631
That's not a private interest.

01:19:47.999 --> 01:19:50.160
We're all citizens of the community.

01:19:51.002 --> 01:19:52.731
On the sidewalk, please.

01:19:57.876 --> 01:20:01.642
The 1,800 hourly workers at this operation
were sent home with flowers today.

01:20:01.713 --> 01:20:04.113
Even union leaders
offered them bleak advice.

01:20:04.182 --> 01:20:07.948
One worker told me, "You know when
they send you flowers? When you die. "

01:20:08.487 --> 01:20:10.478
So, not a very merry Christmas.

01:20:10.722 --> 01:20:13.316
In fact, as one man
walked out of the plant...

01:20:13.391 --> 01:20:16.952
he told me, "l want to wish Roger Smith
a merry Christmas."

01:20:24.636 --> 01:20:26.763
It was now Christmas Eve in Flint.

01:20:27.072 --> 01:20:30.974
After three years of trying to bring
Roger here, I was ready to give up.

01:20:31.476 --> 01:20:34.775
Deputy Fred had three evictions
scheduled for this day.

01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:36.943
At the same time, in Detroit...

01:20:37.015 --> 01:20:39.381
Roger Smith was beaming
his Christmas message...

01:20:39.451 --> 01:20:41.942
to every GM factory throughout the world.

01:20:47.225 --> 01:20:49.193
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:53.857
I'd like to welcome you to our traditional
General Motors Christmas program.

01:21:20.458 --> 01:21:22.790
We're trying to clear up
all evictions today...

01:21:22.861 --> 01:21:27.389
so it won't get into the latter part
of Christmas, which is tomorrow.

01:21:27.566 --> 01:21:29.397
We don't want to do any tomorrow.

01:21:29.467 --> 01:21:31.731
-Because it's Christmas?
-Right.

01:21:34.506 --> 01:21:37.134
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's my pleasure to introduce...

01:21:37.208 --> 01:21:40.837
the chairman of General Motors
with his annual Christmas message...

01:21:40.912 --> 01:21:42.402
Mr. Roger B. Smith.

01:21:49.888 --> 01:21:54.587
You know, the thing that strikes me
about Christmas...

01:21:55.393 --> 01:21:58.419
is that it's such a total experience.

01:21:59.297 --> 01:22:01.424
For a few weeks out of our year...

01:22:01.499 --> 01:22:04.093
our whole environment is transformed.

01:22:05.036 --> 01:22:07.129
There are the lights, of course...

01:22:07.205 --> 01:22:09.935
that lift us out of winter's cold and gloom.

01:22:10.008 --> 01:22:13.637
This bitch got his money
and sent my motherfucking shit out.

01:22:15.447 --> 01:22:19.679
They remind us
of the warmth of human companionship...

01:22:20.385 --> 01:22:23.218
and of the spring that's never far behind.

01:22:25.523 --> 01:22:28.981
Try to lay it down.
The wind will blow it over if you don't.

01:22:29.094 --> 01:22:32.188
We listen for jingle bells in the country.

01:22:32.731 --> 01:22:35.359
We smell the pine needles on the trees...

01:22:35.467 --> 01:22:37.594
and the turkey on the table.

01:22:38.570 --> 01:22:40.868
We even dream of a white Christmas...

01:22:40.939 --> 01:22:45.876
in the hope that nature will accommodate
our longing for a total experience.

01:22:46.077 --> 01:22:48.545
Where are the motherfucking keys?

01:22:48.613 --> 01:22:52.276
-That motherfucker got his money.
-They're setting us out on the street!

01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:55.285
I paid this man his rent. Give me my shit.

01:22:56.688 --> 01:23:00.351
...the individual dignity
and worth of each human being...

01:23:00.425 --> 01:23:03.485
the more fully human
each of us will become.

01:23:03.595 --> 01:23:06.587
He's got his money!
I showed you the paper!

01:23:06.665 --> 01:23:08.155
All I owe that man is $150.

01:23:08.767 --> 01:23:11.565
Now let me close with an observation...

01:23:11.636 --> 01:23:15.936
that I consider
by a real leading authority on Christmas:

01:23:16.474 --> 01:23:19.910
Charles Dickens. Here's what he said:

01:23:21.212 --> 01:23:23.373
"l have always thought of Christmas...

01:23:23.448 --> 01:23:24.847
"as a good time..."

01:23:25.016 --> 01:23:27.041
Get your goddamn coats on!

01:23:27.652 --> 01:23:32.248
"...a kind, forgiving,
charitable, pleasant time... "

01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:35.058
Set my shit out, and I done paid the bitch!

01:23:35.226 --> 01:23:39.219
I only owed the bitch $150, and
I was going to give it to her stinking ass.

01:23:40.265 --> 01:23:44.292
"...the only time I know of,
in the long calendar of the year...

01:23:44.402 --> 01:23:47.303
"when men and women
seem by one consent...

01:23:47.372 --> 01:23:49.363
"to open their hearts freely.

01:23:49.874 --> 01:23:51.136
"And therefore...

01:23:51.209 --> 01:23:55.168
"though it has never
put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket...

01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:58.208
"I believe that it has done me good...

01:23:58.283 --> 01:23:59.910
"and will do me good.

01:24:00.185 --> 01:24:02.415
"And I say, God bless it! "

01:24:03.655 --> 01:24:06.852
Mr. Dickens, I couldn't agree more.

01:24:07.759 --> 01:24:11.559
So I say, "God bless Christmas,
and God bless all of you."

01:24:14.365 --> 01:24:16.799
Thank you for coming.

01:24:19.938 --> 01:24:21.667
Thank you, Mr. Smith.

01:24:32.617 --> 01:24:34.482
Mr. Smith, we came from Flint...

01:24:34.552 --> 01:24:37.350
where we filmed
a family being evicted from their home...

01:24:37.422 --> 01:24:41.153
the day before Christmas Eve.
A family that worked in your factory.

01:24:41.226 --> 01:24:44.627
Would you be willing to come with us
to see the situation in Flint?

01:24:44.696 --> 01:24:49.030
I've been to Flint, and I'm sorry for them,
but I don't know anything about it.

01:24:49.267 --> 01:24:51.599
Families being evicted on Christmas Eve--

01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:53.762
General Motors didn't evict them.

01:24:53.838 --> 01:24:56.398
-Talk to the landlord--
-They used to work for GM.

01:24:56.474 --> 01:24:59.034
-Now they don't work there anymore.
-I'm sorry, but....

01:24:59.110 --> 01:25:01.977
-Could you come to Flint?
-No, I cannot. I'm sorry.

01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:11.950
What's Christmas going to be like
for you this year?

01:25:12.023 --> 01:25:16.119
I get a couple of days off.
That's the good part.

01:25:16.194 --> 01:25:20.756
I get a chance to rest.
But come Tuesday morning, I'll be back.

01:25:38.016 --> 01:25:40.416
I failed to bring Roger to Flint.

01:25:40.885 --> 01:25:43.046
As we neared the end
of the 20th century...

01:25:43.121 --> 01:25:45.681
the rich were richer, the poor poorer...

01:25:46.024 --> 01:25:48.584
and people everywhere had a lot less lint...

01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:51.720
thanks to the lint rollers
made in my hometown.

01:25:51.796 --> 01:25:54.264
It was truly the dawn of a new era.

01:26:00.371 --> 01:26:03.807
If you're espousing a philosophy,
which apparently you are...

01:26:03.975 --> 01:26:07.877
that the corporation owes employees...

01:26:07.946 --> 01:26:11.382
cradle-to-the-grave security,
I don't think that can be accomplished...

01:26:11.449 --> 01:26:13.212
under a free enterprise system.

01:26:25.063 --> 01:26:27.088
Many of us are proud to be here...

01:26:27.165 --> 01:26:31.727
and it will continue to be a good place
to live and raise a family...

01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:33.961
and have a good place to work.

01:26:43.514 --> 01:26:46.278
-Where are you going?
-I am going to Tel Aviv.

01:26:46.351 --> 01:26:47.443
Why?

01:26:47.518 --> 01:26:50.078
Maybe someday
I'll be the Ministress of Tourism.

01:27:05.403 --> 01:27:08.133
I mowed the lawn with my shirt off,
made my back stiff.

01:27:08.206 --> 01:27:11.266
My wife asked me to mow the lawn
with my pants off next time.

01:27:21.419 --> 01:27:26.083
I'm planning on going back to school
in January...

01:27:26.691 --> 01:27:31.185
for veterinary assistance,
and also for dog grooming...

01:27:32.096 --> 01:27:35.657
'cause there's a lot of animals
that need taking care of.

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:51.077
It's great to have you guys here.

01:27:51.149 --> 01:27:54.346
It's been fun having you around.
You see all the craziness that goes on.

01:30:24.001 --> 01:30:26.196
If you decide to go for it, you'll make it.

01:30:36.114 --> 01:30:36.978
English
