♫ All to Jesus

00:15.225 --> 00:17.787

00:50.167 --> 00:53.000

00:59.482 --> 01:03.149
- Satan wears lots of
disguises, doesn't he?

01:04.218 --> 01:06.706
He wears disguises of friendship,

01:06.706 --> 01:08.768
of lustful thoughts,

01:08.768 --> 01:10.518
of drugs and alcohol.

01:12.291 --> 01:16.698
He disguises himself as
things that make us feel good

01:16.698 --> 01:19.802
to make it easier for us to sin.

01:19.802 --> 01:22.149
Isn't that nice of him?

01:22.149 --> 01:25.065
He wants to make it easy for us.

01:25.065 --> 01:26.565
Today of all days

01:28.497 --> 01:31.497
we must work together to stay alert.

01:32.388 --> 01:35.861
We must become a neighborhood watch

01:35.861 --> 01:37.790
on the look out for Satan,

01:37.790 --> 01:41.873
and we must let Jesus
Christ be our watch leader.

01:43.067 --> 01:44.982
For as Peter says,

01:44.982 --> 01:47.065
"Be sober, be vigilante,

01:47.923 --> 01:50.657
"for our adversary the devil

01:50.657 --> 01:53.303
"as a roaring lion walketh about

01:53.303 --> 01:55.803
"seeking whom he may devour",

01:57.405 --> 02:00.072
and whom does he want to devour?

02:05.151 --> 02:06.234
Our children.

02:08.021 --> 02:12.189
For Satan is a pedophile,
brothers and sisters.

02:14.365 --> 02:18.737
Tonight he will be roaming
free in our neighborhoods

02:18.737 --> 02:21.644
luring our children into the shadows

02:21.644 --> 02:23.399
with the promise of candy

02:23.399 --> 02:25.824
forcing his burning darkness upon them

02:25.824 --> 02:29.732
and desecrating their
innocence from the inside out.

02:29.732 --> 02:32.315
We must pray for the children,

02:33.185 --> 02:36.085
and we must pray for each other

02:36.085 --> 02:38.585
for we are all God's children.

02:41.399 --> 02:45.566
God doesn't want us to hide
behind masks and costumes.

02:46.754 --> 02:50.529
He wants us to find
our own greater truths.

02:50.529 --> 02:52.946
That is what a revelation is.

02:54.216 --> 02:56.799
It is a revealing of his truth.

02:58.730 --> 02:59.830
I want you to grab the hand

02:59.830 --> 03:02.663
of the person sitting next to you.

03:04.985 --> 03:07.318
Feel that you are not alone.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.300
Let God touch you.

03:12.554 --> 03:14.221
Let him protect you.

03:15.258 --> 03:17.758
Let him reveal himself to you.

03:19.362 --> 03:21.354
Can you feel him?

03:21.354 --> 03:23.437
Let us all bow our heads.

03:26.101 --> 03:27.996
All of those amongst us

03:27.996 --> 03:31.653
who are so moved by the heavenly spirit

03:31.653 --> 03:33.490
raise up your hands

03:33.490 --> 03:36.334
and show the Lord that you are ready

03:36.334 --> 03:38.584
and willing to receive him.

03:40.961 --> 03:43.977
If you want to be protected by his light,

03:43.977 --> 03:45.624
guided by his power,

03:45.624 --> 03:49.821
saved with his redeeming
blood in your veins,

03:49.821 --> 03:51.627
I invite you to come forward

03:51.627 --> 03:54.213
to kneel before the congregation

03:54.213 --> 03:57.213
and to accept Christ as your savior.

04:21.845 --> 04:24.428
(dog barking)

04:31.570 --> 04:33.153
You gonna eat that?

04:34.590 --> 04:35.967
Dude, I was kidding.

04:35.967 --> 04:37.911
No, you can have it I don't even want it.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.744
I just didn't wanna throw it away.

04:44.053 --> 04:47.159
- You know plain donuts
really are the worst.

04:47.159 --> 04:49.298
It's like just bread.

04:49.298 --> 04:50.879
- Actually that was a powdered one,

04:50.879 --> 04:53.879
but I licked the entire thing first.

04:57.269 --> 05:00.769
- Oh, okay seriously.
- No, no, stop, stop.

05:05.592 --> 05:07.925
- Do you give up?
- Yes, yes.

05:10.704 --> 05:12.725
- Ascencion, I'm so sorry.

05:12.725 --> 05:15.808
I didn't realize you were still here.

05:16.653 --> 05:20.486
- (gasping) Help me.

05:25.684 --> 05:27.626
- Talk to me, Ascencion.

05:27.626 --> 05:30.954
What does the demon do to you?

05:30.954 --> 05:34.165
(woman gasping)

05:34.165 --> 05:36.579
What does the demon do to you?

05:36.579 --> 05:39.329
(woman gasping)

05:44.169 --> 05:48.024
I want you to see Jesus
holding out his arms to you.

05:48.024 --> 05:50.089
I need you to go to him now.

05:50.089 --> 05:52.530
Alright I need you to go be with him.

05:52.530 --> 05:54.012
I need you to go be with him.

05:54.012 --> 05:55.850
Go be safe with Jesus,

05:55.850 --> 05:58.600
and leave the demon here with us.

06:01.324 --> 06:02.157
(woman screaming)

06:02.157 --> 06:04.080
I'm speaking to the demon now.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.952
(woman screaming)

06:05.952 --> 06:08.542
We call upon Jesus to banish the demons

06:08.542 --> 06:11.482
of violence and anger from this body.

06:11.482 --> 06:12.891
(woman mumbling)

06:12.891 --> 06:15.824
We lift this inferior curse.

06:15.824 --> 06:18.964
I will leave this body
and return to the pit.

06:18.964 --> 06:19.797
Say it.

06:21.618 --> 06:24.818
(woman screaming)
(tense music)

06:24.818 --> 06:29.582
I will leave this body and
return to the pit say it.

06:29.582 --> 06:34.067
I will leave this body say it.

06:34.067 --> 06:35.166
Say it.

06:35.166 --> 06:36.328
Say it.

06:36.328 --> 06:38.128
I will leave this body.

06:38.128 --> 06:39.942
I will leave this body.

06:39.942 --> 06:42.402
I will leave this body say it.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.977
(woman gasping)

06:45.977 --> 06:48.065
I will return to the pit.

06:48.065 --> 06:49.143
I will return to the pit.

06:49.143 --> 06:51.393
- I will return to the pit.

06:52.582 --> 06:54.723
- I will return to the pit.

06:54.723 --> 06:56.973
- I will return to the pit.

06:57.827 --> 07:00.744
(heavy breathing)

07:10.809 --> 07:14.976
- Jordan, I would like for
you to lead us in a prayer.

07:22.855 --> 07:26.022
- Blessed and eternal God our Father,

07:27.873 --> 07:31.623
we ask for protection for our friend

07:33.704 --> 07:36.406
and neighbor Ascencion.

07:36.406 --> 07:39.468
Jesus sees that she's one of his children

07:39.468 --> 07:43.645
who's been blinded by
the worldly darkness.

07:43.645 --> 07:46.395
He offers her his guiding hands,

07:47.416 --> 07:48.833
his strong arms,

07:50.016 --> 07:52.599
his divine love to lift her up

07:54.287 --> 07:57.037
and walk beside him in the light.

07:59.702 --> 08:00.535
Amen.

08:03.606 --> 08:06.439
(dramatic music)

08:19.985 --> 08:22.111
- I wonder why we haven't
had any tricker treaters.

08:22.111 --> 08:24.325
We still have like a
hundred tracts to give out.

08:24.325 --> 08:25.783
- Maybe the kids are scared to go--

08:25.783 --> 08:28.072
- Guys, I talked to Pastor Tim today.

08:28.072 --> 08:29.115
He wanted me to tell everyone

08:29.115 --> 08:31.734
that he thinks we're
doing a really great job,

08:31.734 --> 08:34.234
and he's super excited for us.

08:35.344 --> 08:38.010
Guys, this is our first baptism.

08:39.390 --> 08:40.583
How cool is that?

08:40.583 --> 08:41.667
- Super cool.

08:47.229 --> 08:48.062
- Kara,

08:49.171 --> 08:50.004
- What.

08:51.253 --> 08:52.253
- What's up?

08:57.373 --> 08:58.206
- Nothing.

08:59.779 --> 09:01.112
- Kara, come on.

09:02.350 --> 09:06.100
- Okay, that tattoo that eye thing

09:06.943 --> 09:08.821
it's from Martkedejos.

09:08.821 --> 09:10.226
- [Eli] Kedhos.

09:10.226 --> 09:12.023
- What tattoo?

09:12.023 --> 09:14.405
- The one on the back of Ascencion's neck.

09:14.405 --> 09:16.485
It's from Markedehos.

09:16.485 --> 09:19.029
They're a gang and
they're super dangerous.

09:19.029 --> 09:20.703
They kill people with machetes,

09:20.703 --> 09:24.590
and their hand sign thing
is like devil horns.

09:24.590 --> 09:26.157
There was this article in the Times.

09:26.157 --> 09:27.324
- Wow, really.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.826
- Yeah, there was this story where they

09:30.826 --> 09:32.340
kidnapped this teenage girl,

09:32.340 --> 09:34.461
and they made her to be
a prostitute for them.

09:34.461 --> 09:37.667
They wouldn't give her any condoms,

09:37.667 --> 09:41.896
and then they killed her
for giving someone an STD.

09:41.896 --> 09:43.146
- That's crazy.

09:44.116 --> 09:46.695
- Yeah, and then they cut
her body into little pieces,

09:46.695 --> 09:47.966
and they sold her organs.

09:47.966 --> 09:49.017
They ate parts of her,

09:49.017 --> 09:51.299
and they threw the rest into the canyon.

09:51.299 --> 09:52.576
The reason that the cops identified her

09:52.576 --> 09:53.564
was because they found her teeth

09:53.564 --> 09:54.637
in the dumpster.
- Kara, are you having doubts

09:54.637 --> 09:56.447
about the baptism?

09:56.447 --> 09:57.280
- No.

09:59.377 --> 10:02.960
I just think that we
should think about it.

10:04.235 --> 10:06.652
- Okay, let's think about it.

10:08.625 --> 10:10.042
Jordan, thoughts?

10:14.642 --> 10:17.559
- I think that we all came here to

10:19.714 --> 10:22.215
share Christ's love in an area

10:22.215 --> 10:24.382
that has high need for it.

10:26.801 --> 10:30.968
I think that someone like
that has the highest need.

10:32.806 --> 10:33.639
- Exactly.

10:34.981 --> 10:36.306
I mean that's the core foundation

10:36.306 --> 10:38.325
of the neighboring strategy.

10:38.325 --> 10:39.531
- I know.

10:39.531 --> 10:42.714
I'm not saying that we shouldn't help her.

10:42.714 --> 10:45.099
I'm just saying that we
should think about it.

10:45.099 --> 10:47.932
They're a lot of factors you know.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.544
- What sort of factors?

10:50.544 --> 10:53.179
- Like the factor that she
could kill us with a machete.

10:53.179 --> 10:55.589
- [Eli] Lindsey, that's not helping.

10:55.589 --> 10:58.033
- I mean what does the mission
office say about gangs?

10:58.033 --> 11:01.033
Like is there a policy or something?

11:01.935 --> 11:06.070
I mean like what did your dad
say when you talked to him?

11:06.070 --> 11:09.041
- Well, you can call Pastor
Tim back if you like.

11:09.041 --> 11:13.208
- I thing it's awesome that
she wants to get baptized.

11:14.487 --> 11:16.459
We should get those balloons,

11:16.459 --> 11:18.938
you know the white ones,

11:18.938 --> 11:20.579
the little white ones
down at the liquor store.

11:20.579 --> 11:23.112
I'm sure we could like color them somehow.

11:23.112 --> 11:24.195
(doorbell ringing)

11:24.195 --> 11:25.888
Tricker treaters.

11:25.888 --> 11:26.721
Oh, my god.

11:26.721 --> 11:28.600
- Gosh darn it, guys.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.862
Did someone leave the
George Foreman on again?

11:30.862 --> 11:32.712
- [Jordan] I think I might have.

11:32.712 --> 11:35.462
- [Eli] Guys, we have to be super careful

11:35.462 --> 11:37.496
with the breakers in this house.

11:37.496 --> 11:38.925
It's an old house.

11:38.925 --> 11:40.675
- [Jordan] I'm sorry.

11:42.358 --> 11:44.836
- [Eli] The doorbell
probably over loaded it.

11:44.836 --> 11:48.336
- Yeah, I'll go flip the breaker at least.

11:54.415 --> 11:56.998
(lively music)

11:58.107 --> 11:59.808
- [Television Character]
It's like a dream or a song.

11:59.808 --> 12:01.586
It feels like something beautiful,

12:01.586 --> 12:03.630
but you can't hold it in your hand.

12:03.630 --> 12:06.380
Should that make it be less real?

12:10.338 --> 12:14.124
(glass breaking)

12:14.124 --> 12:16.685
(tires screeching)
- Guys on the floor.

12:16.685 --> 12:19.150
(tires screeching)

12:19.150 --> 12:21.425
(dog barking)

12:21.425 --> 12:23.993
(dramatic music)

12:23.993 --> 12:28.160
(television character singing faintly)

12:34.116 --> 12:36.831
(soft buzzing)

12:36.831 --> 12:38.081
- What is that?

12:41.090 --> 12:41.923
- Pipes.

12:46.538 --> 12:49.656
- Sounds like they're gonna explode.

12:49.656 --> 12:52.156
(dog barking)

12:53.519 --> 12:55.186
- They're old pipes.

12:56.916 --> 12:59.916
(car horn honking)

13:03.877 --> 13:05.710
- Should we get a gun?

13:07.334 --> 13:10.127
- You wanna shoot the pipes?

13:10.127 --> 13:11.294
- [Jordan] No.

13:13.327 --> 13:16.937
- [Eli] No, I don't think
we should get a gun.

13:16.937 --> 13:18.814
- It was a stupid idea I guess.

13:18.814 --> 13:20.986
- You only get shot if you're a gangster.

13:20.986 --> 13:22.612
- Yeah.

13:22.612 --> 13:23.779
Yeah, totally.

13:28.352 --> 13:31.185
Why do you think--
- Hey, hold on.

13:36.291 --> 13:39.958
I was getting tired of
talking to your feet.

13:41.823 --> 13:44.490
- I forgot what I was gonna say.

13:45.823 --> 13:48.352
- You know Ascencion really likes you.

13:48.352 --> 13:50.435
- What, what do you mean?

13:52.015 --> 13:52.848
- Yeah.

13:52.848 --> 13:55.109
She was really moved by that
prayer you said for her.

13:55.109 --> 13:58.442
- No, no that was nothing.

13:59.365 --> 14:03.342
- Seriously I mean getting
through to someone like that

14:03.342 --> 14:04.675
it's a big deal.

14:05.875 --> 14:07.711
I don't just mean from the gang aspect,

14:07.711 --> 14:12.368
but when you think about like
the voodoo and the witchcraft

14:12.368 --> 14:16.489
and the blood sacrifice that's
in a generational history

14:16.489 --> 14:21.251
I mean that's power stuff
that you're doing battle with.

14:21.251 --> 14:24.240
- Yeah, but I mean you're the
one that did all the work.

14:24.240 --> 14:27.407
You're the one that really helped her.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.242
- Yeah, you're right.

14:31.242 --> 14:33.068
She probably just thinks
you're cute or something.

14:33.068 --> 14:35.747
- (laughing) Shut up.

14:35.747 --> 14:36.786
- [Eli] Night, buddy.

14:36.786 --> 14:37.619
- Night.

14:40.010 --> 14:43.010
(car horn honking)

15:01.304 --> 15:04.137
(dramatic music)

16:00.888 --> 16:03.295
- [Kara] Guys, guys wake up.

16:03.295 --> 16:04.955
- What's going on?

16:04.955 --> 16:06.955
- [Jordan] I don't know.

16:23.904 --> 16:25.154
- We got robed.

16:26.022 --> 16:28.960
- Oh, my gosh do you think that
they're still in the house?

16:28.960 --> 16:30.781
- They took the folding chairs

16:30.781 --> 16:33.741
and the computer and my phone.

16:33.741 --> 16:35.491
- Heck, the keyboard.

16:36.933 --> 16:38.600
Dude, I am so sorry.

16:39.518 --> 16:43.167
- I mean seriously they took my phone.

16:43.167 --> 16:45.653
What if they call my mom?

16:45.653 --> 16:47.102
- Why would they call your mom?

16:47.102 --> 16:50.576
- I don't know to say dirty stuff to her.

16:50.576 --> 16:53.031
- What are we going to do?

16:53.031 --> 16:54.881
- Call the police.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.246
- No, that's a bad idea.

16:56.246 --> 16:57.218
- Why?

16:57.218 --> 17:01.150
- Because then we'd have a
cop car in front of the house.

17:01.150 --> 17:02.480
- If there's a cop car
in front of the house,

17:02.480 --> 17:04.955
then no one in the
neighborhood's gonna trust us.

17:04.955 --> 17:06.238
- Yeah.

17:06.238 --> 17:08.117
We need them to trust us.

17:08.117 --> 17:09.042
We can't have them thinking

17:09.042 --> 17:11.676
we're gonna call a cop every 10 minutes.

17:11.676 --> 17:12.917
We don't wanna be outsiders.

17:12.917 --> 17:14.807
- They already think we're outsiders.

17:14.807 --> 17:17.310
They freaking robbed us.

17:17.310 --> 17:18.671
We're being targeted.

17:18.671 --> 17:19.938
- Why would they be targeting us.

17:19.938 --> 17:22.146
I mean all we've done is
give these people food

17:22.146 --> 17:23.107
and prayed for them.

17:23.107 --> 17:24.284
I mean ungrateful can you--.

17:24.284 --> 17:28.329
- Ladies, listen to me
for one moment all right.

17:28.329 --> 17:30.497
We are not being targeted.

17:31.793 --> 17:33.631
This is what's called
a crime of opportunity.

17:33.631 --> 17:35.979
We learned about this.

17:35.979 --> 17:37.340
Alright we should've boarded up the window

17:37.340 --> 17:40.423
right after the drive by case closed.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.206
This is an opportunity.

17:44.206 --> 17:45.774
God is providing us with the chance

17:45.774 --> 17:49.419
to be better prepared next time that's it.

17:49.419 --> 17:50.586
- Eli's right.

17:51.764 --> 17:53.224
(woman gasping)

17:53.224 --> 17:54.696
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

17:54.696 --> 17:56.805
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.

17:56.805 --> 17:58.464
- That.

17:58.464 --> 18:01.047
(tense music)

18:16.645 --> 18:18.045
- Can you hold this?

18:18.045 --> 18:19.878
- [Jordan] Yeah, sure.

18:22.117 --> 18:22.950
- Got it?

18:24.137 --> 18:25.220
- Yeah, yeah.

18:33.900 --> 18:35.853
(dramatic music)

18:35.853 --> 18:37.239
- Sorry.

18:37.239 --> 18:38.739
- No, you're fine.

19:04.049 --> 19:05.660
- Careful I don't wanna get your hand.

19:05.660 --> 19:08.493
(Jordan mumbling)

19:15.183 --> 19:18.316
I don't think you have to hold it anymore.

19:18.316 --> 19:19.399
- Yeah, yeah.

19:21.458 --> 19:22.795
- Think I got a splinter.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.358
- Oh, no.

19:24.358 --> 19:27.108
Do you want me to try and get it?

19:32.098 --> 19:34.589
- Dude, where'd you get this?

19:34.589 --> 19:37.019
- I won it at MTYC,

19:37.019 --> 19:39.651
the frisbee golf thing.

19:39.651 --> 19:42.416
- Shot that's right frolf champ '08.

19:42.416 --> 19:44.377
- [Jordan] You know it.

19:44.377 --> 19:48.789
♫ We are marching in the light of Jesus

19:48.789 --> 19:50.502
♫ Marching in the light of God

19:50.502 --> 19:53.305
- Dude, please tell me you
still have that hackie sack?

19:53.305 --> 19:55.539
- No, no I kicked it into the river

19:55.539 --> 19:58.274
'cause I'm super coordinated.

19:58.274 --> 20:00.365
- That's a bummer I was gonna
say we should play right now.

20:00.365 --> 20:01.198
- I know.

20:02.054 --> 20:03.036
- Here.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.786
- Okay, let's see it.

20:06.917 --> 20:08.804
Oh, yeah, yeah there it is.

20:08.804 --> 20:10.399
- Think you can get it?

20:10.399 --> 20:13.816
- I don't know it's in there pretty deep.

20:14.842 --> 20:15.675
- Come on.

20:16.563 --> 20:18.396
Use that frolf spirit.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.149
Dude, you would make a terrible surgeon.

20:23.149 --> 20:25.649
Look how shaky your hands are.

20:29.586 --> 20:32.597
- [Jordan] Yeah, yeah there it is.

20:32.597 --> 20:33.430
- You got it?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:33.430 --> 20:34.752
- Okay.
- Hold on to it.

20:34.752 --> 20:35.585
- Yep.

20:36.921 --> 20:37.754
Dang,

20:38.678 --> 20:40.095
that's a big one.

20:52.098 --> 20:54.931
(dramatic music)

20:57.834 --> 21:02.001
(pulsating heartbeat)
(police siren blaring)

21:16.216 --> 21:19.017
♫ Perfect delight

21:19.017 --> 21:22.289
♫ Visions of rapture

21:22.289 --> 21:25.450
♫ First in my sight

21:25.450 --> 21:28.734
♫ Angels descending

21:28.734 --> 21:32.051

21:32.051 --> 21:35.298

21:38.701 --> 21:42.283

21:42.283 --> 21:45.579
♫ This is my song

21:45.579 --> 21:48.952

♫ Praising savior

22:02.439 --> 22:05.356

22:08.269 --> 22:11.019
- Baptism is not about salvation.

22:12.400 --> 22:15.123
It's not a step that you have to take

22:15.123 --> 22:17.456
in order to get into Heaven.

22:18.644 --> 22:20.061
It's about trust.

22:21.826 --> 22:22.993
It's a choice.

22:26.228 --> 22:28.395
It's a decision made by someone

22:28.395 --> 22:31.062
of age to have informed consent

22:32.098 --> 22:35.098
making a public profession of faith.

22:37.403 --> 22:40.820
Baptism is not about getting into Heaven.

22:42.037 --> 22:46.865
It's about living for
Jesus Christ here on Earth.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.694
Have you accepted Jesus Christ

22:48.694 --> 22:51.444
as your personal Lord and savior?

22:52.500 --> 22:53.333
- Yes.

22:54.577 --> 22:58.778
- In obedience to our Lord
and savior Jesus Christ

22:58.778 --> 23:01.642
and upon your profession of faith

23:01.642 --> 23:04.176
I baptize you my sister

23:04.176 --> 23:08.343
in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

23:09.621 --> 23:12.988
Buried with him in the
likeness of his death

23:12.988 --> 23:17.155
and raised with him in the
likeness of his resurrection.

23:27.188 --> 23:30.521
(police siren blaring)

23:37.608 --> 23:40.711
Hey, you've room for this one?

23:40.711 --> 23:41.794
- Yeah, yeah.

23:54.899 --> 23:57.657
(soft buzzing)

23:57.657 --> 24:00.240
(dog barking)

24:17.056 --> 24:20.368

24:39.950 --> 24:43.617

24:44.699 --> 24:48.199

(tense music)

25:23.836 --> 25:25.003
- Oh, my gosh.

25:27.459 --> 25:30.375
Oh, my god.
- No, no Lindsey.

25:30.375 --> 25:32.000
Lindsey.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.570
Lindsey.

25:33.570 --> 25:35.372
Hey, Lindsey are you okay?

25:35.372 --> 25:36.920
- What's going on?

25:36.920 --> 25:38.857
- I don't know Lindsey was just acting.

25:38.857 --> 25:41.862
She's acting kind of weird so I just

25:41.862 --> 25:42.695
- Lindsey.

25:43.962 --> 25:46.372
Lindsey are you okay?

25:46.372 --> 25:47.539
Can I come in?

25:57.570 --> 26:00.092
- Kara, this is really good.

26:00.092 --> 26:00.925
- Thanks.

26:03.686 --> 26:08.064
- So do you know where you're
gonna go for your MDiv yet?

26:08.064 --> 26:10.591
- I mean Pastor Tim wants me
to go to Southern Evangelical,

26:10.591 --> 26:12.957
but I kind of wanna go somewhere more new

26:12.957 --> 26:15.721
you know like Veritas or something.

26:15.721 --> 26:18.053
It's a long way off.

26:18.053 --> 26:22.136
- They're doing this really
cool stuff like in Boston where

26:22.136 --> 26:23.476
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

26:23.476 --> 26:27.643
It's this new Lazarus program
where you take your group

26:28.995 --> 26:33.162
and you put it on really strict
budgets and diets and stuff.

26:34.907 --> 26:38.974
Yeah, and then you just give
the rest of your money away.

26:38.974 --> 26:43.166
It's like this commitment to
fighting poverty kind of stuff.

26:43.166 --> 26:46.000
- But I think poverty is a good thing.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.828
- Poverty is a good thing.

26:47.828 --> 26:50.125
- Yeah, I mean you get too comfortable

26:50.125 --> 26:52.708
you forget that you need Jesus.

26:53.601 --> 26:55.845
I'm not a huge fan of all the

26:55.845 --> 26:59.102
social justice stuff on the east coast.

26:59.102 --> 27:02.522
I mean you go to Heaven
with your teeth fixed great.

27:02.522 --> 27:04.979
Go to hell with your
teeth fixed not to great

27:04.979 --> 27:06.531
you know what I mean?

27:06.531 --> 27:10.114
- Yeah, yeah like it's
not the right focus.

27:11.264 --> 27:13.409
- Yeah, I mean it's like the old saying

27:13.409 --> 27:15.991
you know you wanna teach people to fish

27:15.991 --> 27:17.794
not just give them a fish.

27:17.794 --> 27:20.153
- Yeah, 'cause if you just
give them fish then they just

27:20.153 --> 27:24.320
they just want tartar
sauce (laughing) right?

27:25.191 --> 27:26.024
- Exactly.

27:27.243 --> 27:31.098
Anyway I might go to Russia
next year do discipleship there

27:31.098 --> 27:32.715
you know get some life experience.

27:32.715 --> 27:36.577
- Isn't that kind of dangerous though.

27:36.577 --> 27:39.207
I mean don't they kill
evangelicals in Russia.

27:39.207 --> 27:42.292
- Well, it's super dangerous for sure.

27:42.292 --> 27:45.391
But in a way it's harder to be
a missionary here in America.

27:45.391 --> 27:48.547
People hide their demons here.

27:48.547 --> 27:51.540
- I'm gonna get Lindsey a plate of food.

27:51.540 --> 27:53.749
- But didn't she say she wasn't hungry.

27:53.749 --> 27:55.589
- [Kara] No, I'm just gonna go see.

27:55.589 --> 27:56.740
- I could bring it to her if you--

27:56.740 --> 27:58.740
- [Kara] Okay, I got it.

28:04.135 --> 28:07.468
- Tell her we hope she's feeling better.

28:09.220 --> 28:13.303
You know I do like your idea
for the toy drive though.

28:13.303 --> 28:14.392
- Wait.

28:14.392 --> 28:16.072
Wait what did you?

28:16.072 --> 28:17.480
Oh, right.

28:17.480 --> 28:21.706
Yeah the toy drive that
could be fun right?

28:21.706 --> 28:24.599
You had just mentioned the
kids in the neighborhood

28:24.599 --> 28:26.266
and got me thinking.

28:28.759 --> 28:30.230
- You know,

28:30.230 --> 28:33.466
I think you would make a
really great pastor someday.

28:33.466 --> 28:34.299
- Really.

28:34.299 --> 28:36.501
- [Eli] You should consider it, yeah.

28:36.501 --> 28:40.660
- I don't like to talk in
front of people, like groups.

28:40.660 --> 28:42.020
It really makes me nervous.

28:42.020 --> 28:43.428
- Yeah, but that like makes you

28:43.428 --> 28:44.896
way more approachable to people.

28:44.896 --> 28:47.102
You know, you got this whole like

28:47.102 --> 28:49.852
sort of poet soul thing going on.

28:58.545 --> 28:59.941
Feeling better?

28:59.941 --> 29:00.774
- Huh?

29:06.082 --> 29:08.450
Are you feeling better?

29:08.450 --> 29:11.990
- Jordan, I'm going to give you
a chance to explain yourself

29:11.990 --> 29:15.059
before I tell Eli what I saw.

29:15.059 --> 29:16.732
I think that it is your right

29:16.732 --> 29:18.515
and responsibility to this group

29:18.515 --> 29:22.598
and to God to be honest
with all of us right now.

29:23.462 --> 29:24.328
- I don't know what you're

29:24.328 --> 29:26.800
talking about.
- Yes, you do know.

29:26.800 --> 29:29.100
- No, I really, really don't.

29:29.100 --> 29:32.768
- I was walking down the
hallway before dinner,

29:32.768 --> 29:33.957
Eli was in the shower,

29:33.957 --> 29:37.273
and the bathroom door was open.

29:37.273 --> 29:39.059
Jordan was watching Eli through the door

29:39.059 --> 29:41.809
and touching himself.

29:43.081 --> 29:46.073
(nervous laughter)
- What?

29:46.073 --> 29:46.906
Seriously.

29:49.166 --> 29:51.999
No, I mean I was in hall, but...

29:52.954 --> 29:57.494
No, I was there to see if
Eli was done in the shower.

29:57.494 --> 30:01.661
I mean we keep the door open
because of the steam issue.

30:04.463 --> 30:06.389
I mean, yeah, I guess I
could see why you would think

30:06.389 --> 30:08.806
that I was doing that, but...

30:11.343 --> 30:12.772
Was that why you ran off like that?

30:12.772 --> 30:14.887
- Jordan, denying it is
only making it worse.

30:14.887 --> 30:17.304
I saw you, you were you know.

30:18.253 --> 30:20.923
I would not make this up, okay.

30:20.923 --> 30:23.445
Do you even realize how hard
it is for me to say the words.

30:23.445 --> 30:24.804
I mean how do you think I feel.

30:24.804 --> 30:26.535
- I didn't.
- Honestly, I mean

30:26.535 --> 30:29.036
I'm just sickened by this.

30:29.036 --> 30:32.119
Jordan, I'm not trying to attack you.

30:33.226 --> 30:35.187
I care about you.

30:35.187 --> 30:36.020
We all do.

30:39.713 --> 30:40.546
- Jordan,

30:42.633 --> 30:45.189
we're all on the same side here.

30:45.189 --> 30:47.939
Just tell us what happened, okay.

30:49.360 --> 30:50.943
- Nothing happened.

30:54.918 --> 30:58.320
(Jordan stammering)

30:58.320 --> 31:00.269
I don't know what I'm supposed to say.

31:00.269 --> 31:02.686
- The truth.
- Lindsey.

31:08.621 --> 31:10.204
Just say yes or no.

31:12.127 --> 31:15.019
- I haven't been feeling well.

31:15.019 --> 31:16.019
- Yes or no.

31:16.952 --> 31:17.971
- I mean I was in the hall--

31:17.971 --> 31:18.971
- Yes or no.

31:23.746 --> 31:24.579
- Yes.

31:29.104 --> 31:30.521
- We should pray.

31:42.397 --> 31:44.730
Blessed and eternal Father,

31:49.335 --> 31:51.995
- Blessed and eternal Father,

31:51.995 --> 31:53.277
we thank you for your power

31:53.277 --> 31:56.016
to deliver us from all bondage.

31:56.016 --> 31:58.638
We pray for Jordan that he may be released

31:58.638 --> 32:00.949
from this spirit of sexual perversion

32:00.949 --> 32:04.699
and forgiven for his
wicked and vile actions.

32:06.725 --> 32:09.408
We ask that the fire of the Holy Spirit

32:09.408 --> 32:12.408
purge his soul in the name of Jesus.

32:15.372 --> 32:16.205
- Amen.

32:21.456 --> 32:23.039
Thank you, Lindsey.

32:36.173 --> 32:39.673
(emergency siren blaring)

32:51.416 --> 32:54.583
(pulsating drum beat)

33:04.214 --> 33:06.797
(dogs barking)

33:33.281 --> 33:35.281
- Hey, do you need help?

33:36.339 --> 33:37.256
- I'm good.

33:39.951 --> 33:42.091
There was a dead rat in here this morning.

33:42.091 --> 33:43.723
- Oh, really.

33:43.723 --> 33:45.662
I didn't even know that
we had rats around here.

33:45.662 --> 33:49.829
I thought they were just like
around the docks and stuff.

33:52.756 --> 33:55.006
I could get another sponge.

33:56.267 --> 33:57.267
- It's okay.

33:59.143 --> 34:01.893
Kind of one person job, you know.

34:03.468 --> 34:04.301
- Yeah.

34:05.499 --> 34:06.916
Yeah, okay, yeah.

34:29.203 --> 34:32.175
Purify my soul from darkness

34:32.175 --> 34:34.272
and deliver me from the
struggles of my sins

34:34.272 --> 34:37.902
from the struggles my sins
have built against me.

34:37.902 --> 34:42.070
I ask that you empower me
with your power and wash me

34:43.402 --> 34:47.569
and wash me in the redeeming
blood of Jesus Christ.

35:03.998 --> 35:06.220
Hey, where is everyone.

35:06.220 --> 35:09.183
- They went shopping for the toy drive.

35:09.183 --> 35:10.850
How are you feeling?

35:12.023 --> 35:12.940
- I'm okay.

35:14.527 --> 35:18.989
- I stayed behind because
I wanted to talk to you.

35:18.989 --> 35:19.822
- Oh.

35:21.317 --> 35:22.150
Oh, okay.

35:29.154 --> 35:31.260
- I wanted to let you know

35:31.260 --> 35:35.325
that I think I understand your problem.

35:35.325 --> 35:36.158
- You do.

35:37.835 --> 35:39.835
- It's the neighborhood.

35:41.294 --> 35:42.877
- The neighborhood.

35:44.102 --> 35:47.309
- What you're feeling
is Satan's influence.

35:47.309 --> 35:49.342
If we stay here long enough,

35:49.342 --> 35:51.359
he'll enter all of us.

35:51.359 --> 35:53.371
So that's why I think we need to leave.

35:53.371 --> 35:55.968
I mean I've given this a lot of thought,

35:55.968 --> 36:00.135
and I think it's the only
solution that makes sense.

36:04.190 --> 36:07.592
- Have you talked to
anyone else about this?

36:07.592 --> 36:11.478
- No, I wanted to talk to you first,

36:11.478 --> 36:13.689
so we can go to them together.

36:13.689 --> 36:17.674
They're not gonna listen if it's just me.

36:17.674 --> 36:19.895
- I'm gonna pray on this, okay.

36:19.895 --> 36:20.728
- Okay.

36:22.808 --> 36:24.891
- I'm gonna go for a run.

36:27.654 --> 36:30.075
- Can you get some toilet paper?

36:30.075 --> 36:32.002
I don't wanna go out there.

36:32.002 --> 36:32.835
- Sure.

36:34.873 --> 36:36.373
- And Dr. Skipper.

36:38.107 --> 36:42.190
- Why don't you make a
list of whatever you want

36:43.468 --> 36:45.801
and I'll pick it up for you.

43:21.698 --> 43:22.531
I'm just in a bad mood.

43:26.549 --> 43:27.882
I'm backsliding.

43:29.383 --> 43:30.550
I can feel it.

43:36.387 --> 43:39.397
- You answered the altar call.

43:39.397 --> 43:41.564
You asked for forgiveness.

43:43.923 --> 43:44.926
You're on the right path

43:44.926 --> 43:47.176
just keep doing a good job.

43:50.385 --> 43:52.385

44:41.380 --> 44:42.213
- Yes.

44:44.465 --> 44:48.591
- In obedience to our Lord
and savior Jesus Christ

44:48.591 --> 44:52.758
and upon your profession of
faith I baptize you my brother

44:53.923 --> 44:55.774
in the name of the Father

44:55.774 --> 44:58.107
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

45:00.243 --> 45:03.910
Buried with him in the
likeness of his death

45:06.529 --> 45:08.536
(dramatic music)

45:08.536 --> 45:11.369
(women giggling)

45:12.828 --> 45:16.995
and raised with him in the
likeness of his resurrection.

45:22.282 --> 45:24.372
So the guy's in trouble, right.

45:24.372 --> 45:26.209
He's runaway from home.

45:26.209 --> 45:28.020
He's partied with the gentiles.

45:28.020 --> 45:30.399
He spent all of his father's
money and gone broke,

45:30.399 --> 45:33.062
so what does he do next?

45:33.062 --> 45:34.562
He goes
- He goes.

45:35.602 --> 45:38.276
- He goes to a farm to feed pigs,

45:38.276 --> 45:40.730
and in the first century
Greco-Roman culture

45:40.730 --> 45:43.385
Jewish people are
forbidden from eating pork

45:43.385 --> 45:45.648
because pigs are considered unclean.

45:45.648 --> 45:48.873
So that's just a little
bit of historical context.

45:48.873 --> 45:52.266
It basically makes what
he does one of the lowest

45:52.266 --> 45:55.814
most degrading things that
someone in his position could do.

45:55.814 --> 45:57.445
- But do you think he
thinks it's degrading,

45:57.445 --> 45:59.003
or is it something--
- Worse than that

45:59.003 --> 46:00.680
worse than going to this farm

46:00.680 --> 46:02.384
to work with these unclean animals

46:02.384 --> 46:03.514
what happens in the next verse

46:03.514 --> 46:06.038
when he actually goes to feeds the pigs?

46:06.038 --> 46:09.171
- He longs for what the pigs are eating.

46:09.171 --> 46:10.882
- He longs for it.

46:10.882 --> 46:12.598
He yearns for it.

46:12.598 --> 46:16.175
He craves this slop.

46:16.175 --> 46:19.866
- What exactly is in first century slop?

46:19.866 --> 46:20.699
- What?

46:27.171 --> 46:29.060
- Just for historical context

46:29.060 --> 46:32.009
I was just wondering what exactly is in

46:32.009 --> 46:35.111
first century Greco-Roman slop?

46:35.111 --> 46:39.278
- Yeah, I don't know what's
in first century slop.

46:41.908 --> 46:44.158
- Okay, I was just curious.

46:50.551 --> 46:53.711
- If you have an issue
Jordan we can all discuss it.

46:53.711 --> 46:55.461
This is a safe space.

46:56.945 --> 46:58.945
- I don't have an issue.

47:00.132 --> 47:01.965
- Okay, see well I do.

47:02.917 --> 47:04.819
I have an issue with you intentionally

47:04.819 --> 47:06.643
derailing the study group.

47:06.643 --> 47:09.709
I think that all of our
time would be best served

47:09.709 --> 47:11.184
if you went elsewhere to practice some

47:11.184 --> 47:12.841
quiet contemplation on your own.

47:12.841 --> 47:14.204
- Are you giving me a time out?

47:14.204 --> 47:17.070
- I am making a recommendation.

48:03.965 --> 48:05.298
- Should I pack?

48:06.249 --> 48:07.511
- I don't know, Kara.

48:07.511 --> 48:10.844
I think you should do whatever you want.

48:15.824 --> 48:18.560
- Jordan and I were just talking about

48:18.560 --> 48:21.893
if I should do potato salad or coleslaw.

48:24.589 --> 48:27.052
- Potato salad, right?

48:27.052 --> 48:28.552
It's more filling.

48:39.757 --> 48:40.590
Hey.

48:41.830 --> 48:42.913
Stop packing.

48:49.222 --> 48:50.972
Come and sit with me.

49:03.297 --> 49:04.130
Man,

49:05.776 --> 49:08.109
I've been a horrible friend.

49:12.752 --> 49:13.782
You're going through hell

49:13.782 --> 49:17.115
and I haven't been there for you at all.

49:18.434 --> 49:23.248
- I wouldn't wanna be around
me either if I was you.

49:23.248 --> 49:24.415
I'm a pervert.

49:25.328 --> 49:26.161

You're someone who's asking for help.

49:31.986 --> 49:36.121
I haven't been strong
enough to give that to you,

49:36.121 --> 49:37.204
but I am now.

49:40.160 --> 49:42.160
- I don't think you can.

49:44.470 --> 49:47.637
- [Eli] I'm willing to try if you are.

49:49.711 --> 49:50.544
- How?

49:53.774 --> 49:55.524
- Tell me everything.

50:01.303 --> 50:03.239
- How it started?

50:03.239 --> 50:04.489
What it's like?

50:05.331 --> 50:06.498
Every thought.

50:08.716 --> 50:11.716
Look I know this is kind of awkward.

50:14.519 --> 50:18.546
Honestly this is how I
would counsel anyone.

50:18.546 --> 50:22.046
We'll just pretend that it's not about me.

50:24.097 --> 50:26.097
Really I'm cool with it.

50:30.734 --> 50:34.901
- Yeah, I'm not really sure
how to answer that question.

50:35.833 --> 50:37.338
- Just tell me when you started

50:37.338 --> 50:40.088
noticing feeling stuff like this.

50:45.147 --> 50:47.230
- I don't know it's just

50:48.272 --> 50:51.855
random thoughts will
just pop into my head.

50:55.100 --> 50:58.350
It's like they're not even my thoughts.

51:02.095 --> 51:05.178
- What kind of thoughts specifically?

51:07.941 --> 51:11.498
- No, it's not like I wanna
act on them or anything.

51:11.498 --> 51:16.038
It's not like I even feel
that way about men in general.

51:16.038 --> 51:18.121
It's just when I think...

51:20.248 --> 51:22.665
Like when it's more specific.

51:24.302 --> 51:26.152
- I mean that's great.

51:26.152 --> 51:27.880
I mean you just said you don't wanna

51:27.880 --> 51:31.713
act on it and that is
the most important part.

51:32.838 --> 51:36.023
What concerns me is that you said

51:36.023 --> 51:39.579
these thoughts don't feel like your own.

51:39.579 --> 51:41.829
Do you mean that literally?

51:47.327 --> 51:48.160
- Yeah.

51:49.018 --> 51:50.435
Yeah, I think so.

51:51.457 --> 51:55.040
It's like I can't even
control them at all.

51:55.988 --> 51:59.738
- Do you feel sick in your stomach?

52:01.076 --> 52:02.243
You can't eat?

52:05.329 --> 52:07.120
How's your sleep?

52:07.120 --> 52:08.037
- Terrible.

52:10.593 --> 52:12.343
- Do you hear voices?

52:15.703 --> 52:16.536
- Maybe.

52:18.482 --> 52:19.500
I think so.

52:19.500 --> 52:20.333
- May I?

52:21.343 --> 52:22.760
- [Jordan] Yeah.

52:26.753 --> 52:29.836
- I've never told anyone this before.

52:32.867 --> 52:34.784
When my sister was 13,

52:35.728 --> 52:37.728
she manifested a demon,

52:39.413 --> 52:41.246
a really powerful one.

52:42.246 --> 52:43.079
- She did.

52:45.674 --> 52:49.841
- I won some goldfish at
the fair and we came home.

52:52.188 --> 52:55.412
She took them out of my tank

52:55.412 --> 52:58.639
and put them on the window sill.

52:58.639 --> 53:02.472
She made me watch as
they suffocated to death.

53:05.382 --> 53:07.799
Your heartbeat's really fast.

53:08.731 --> 53:10.314
- So what happened?

53:15.937 --> 53:18.020
- She started hurting me.

53:19.940 --> 53:22.440
I didn't tell anyone about it.

53:26.019 --> 53:29.335
Eventually she took a hockey stick,

53:29.335 --> 53:32.394
and she hit me in the face.

53:32.394 --> 53:34.477
She knocked out my teeth.

53:36.531 --> 53:38.120
That was when Pastor Tim realized

53:38.120 --> 53:41.453
that she had manifested a demon of rage.

53:44.583 --> 53:47.666
They performed a deliverance on her,

53:49.649 --> 53:51.982
and they cast the demon out.

53:53.431 --> 53:56.931
She went back to normal for the most part.

54:00.881 --> 54:03.214
- You're kind of scaring me.

54:05.929 --> 54:08.096
- I don't wanna scare you.

54:09.950 --> 54:11.367
I wanna help you.

54:28.907 --> 54:30.880
- Always night and day
he was in the mountains

54:30.880 --> 54:34.062
and in the tombs crying and
cutting himself with stones,

54:34.062 --> 54:37.292
but when he saw Jesus afar
off he ran and worshiped him

54:37.292 --> 54:38.790
and cried with a loud voice and said,

54:38.790 --> 54:40.471
"What have I to do with thee, Jesus

54:40.471 --> 54:42.565
"the Son of the Most High God.

54:42.565 --> 54:46.145
"I adjure thee by God
that thou torment me not."

54:46.145 --> 54:47.344
For he said unto him,

54:47.344 --> 54:51.011
"Come out of the man thou unclean spirit."

54:51.916 --> 54:55.009
The unclean spirits went out
and entered into the swine,

54:55.009 --> 54:58.309
and the herd ran violently down
a steep place into the sea.

54:58.309 --> 55:00.937
There were about 2,000 of them

55:00.937 --> 55:03.187
and were choked in the sea.

55:04.397 --> 55:06.980
(tense music)

55:11.736 --> 55:15.801
They went out to see what
it was that was done.

55:15.801 --> 55:16.796
They came.

55:16.796 --> 55:19.379
They came to Jesus and see him

55:21.131 --> 55:23.883
see he that was possessed with the devil

55:23.883 --> 55:27.033
devil and had the legion sitting

55:27.033 --> 55:29.811
and clothed and in his right mind

55:29.811 --> 55:31.561
and they were afraid.

55:32.972 --> 55:35.555
(tense music)

56:06.021 --> 56:09.347
(people laughing)

56:09.347 --> 56:11.930
(tense music)

56:22.259 --> 56:25.009
- Can I get you anything, Pamela?

56:26.463 --> 56:29.630
- They're shooting horses out west.

56:29.630 --> 56:30.993
- Excuse me.

56:30.993 --> 56:33.359
- They're over populated out there.

56:33.359 --> 56:36.145
They shoot them from the airplanes now.

56:36.145 --> 56:39.395
I think that's terrible, just terrible.

56:49.986 --> 56:52.290
(foreign language spoken)

56:52.290 --> 56:54.027
- This is my friend Blanca.

56:54.027 --> 56:56.109
- Blanca, mucho gusto.

56:56.109 --> 56:58.812
Any friend of Ascencion a friend of ours.

56:58.812 --> 56:59.645
I hope you guys are hungry.

56:59.645 --> 57:02.213
We have some great food.

57:02.213 --> 57:03.796
Where are you from?

57:06.596 --> 57:08.596
Yeah, so we got hotdogs

57:09.704 --> 57:12.871
and I think some hamburgers somewhere.

57:13.880 --> 57:15.614
Hey, buddy.

57:15.614 --> 57:16.791
You okay.

57:16.791 --> 57:18.601
- You have to submit.

57:18.601 --> 57:19.836
You have to submit to Jesus.

57:19.836 --> 57:22.502
You have to allow him to cast out

57:22.502 --> 57:24.797
them out like the pigs off the cliff.

57:24.797 --> 57:28.964
- Hey, Jordan, listen to me
I think Kara needs some help.

57:30.240 --> 57:31.073
- Okay.

57:32.416 --> 57:34.249
Yeah, yeah, yeah okay.

57:47.966 --> 57:50.851
- You should come inside
and lie down for a bit.

57:50.851 --> 57:52.934
You don't look very good.

57:53.770 --> 57:56.674
I'll come check on you in a bit, okay?

57:56.674 --> 58:00.507
I'll bring you some tuna
mac then we can talk.

58:10.523 --> 58:13.550
- So the old lady yells Acts 2:38

58:13.550 --> 58:14.645
and the robber freezes.

58:14.645 --> 58:16.780
He stops what he's doing.

58:16.780 --> 58:19.794
The cops get there and they say to him,

58:19.794 --> 58:21.408
"All the old lady did
was yell a bible verse.

58:21.408 --> 58:23.013
"Why'd you stop?"

58:23.013 --> 58:26.002
He says, "Bible verse I thought she said

58:26.002 --> 58:28.966
"she had an ax and two 38s."

58:28.966 --> 58:32.484
(foreign language spoken)

58:32.484 --> 58:35.234
- I would've gotten out of there.

58:36.084 --> 58:39.143
- Okay, so basically Acts 2:38
is a bible verse that says

58:39.143 --> 58:41.441
if you repent and you're baptized

58:41.441 --> 58:44.798
then your sins will be forgiven.

58:44.798 --> 58:48.470
- Then you will receive the
gift of the Holy Spirit.

58:48.470 --> 58:49.303
- Exactly.

58:50.339 --> 58:52.191
Anyway we have a ton of leftover food.

58:52.191 --> 58:54.861
I hope you guys will take some with you.

58:54.861 --> 58:56.847
- No, no we can't.
- I'll give you guys extra

58:56.847 --> 59:01.079
so that you can have some for
the people you live with too.

59:01.079 --> 59:03.727
- It wouldn't be a good idea because

59:03.727 --> 59:06.810
then they will know that we was here.

59:10.770 --> 59:13.416
- You know there are safe places.

59:13.416 --> 59:15.694
People can protect you.

59:15.694 --> 59:16.944
I can help you.

59:18.054 --> 59:20.304
- You've already helped me.

59:22.961 --> 59:26.414
I used to live with evil inside of me,

59:26.414 --> 59:29.164
and now I have the love of Jesus.

59:32.250 --> 59:34.000
- I know you do, but

59:35.188 --> 59:39.339
you can't worship Jesus and
live in the devil's house.

59:39.339 --> 59:41.089
You know what I mean?

59:45.276 --> 59:47.176
- [Kara] Jordan.

59:47.176 --> 59:49.676
(tense music)

59:53.524 --> 59:54.691
Are you okay?

59:58.058 --> 01:00:00.598
(Jordan growling)
(Kara gasping)

01:00:00.598 --> 01:00:01.431
- [Lindsey] Kara.

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:05.598
(Jordan muttering foreign dialect)

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:09.900
(suspenseful music)

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:15.844
- Was that

01:00:18.507 --> 01:00:19.340
Spanish?

01:00:34.367 --> 01:00:37.284
(Jordan gurgling)

01:00:41.205 --> 01:00:42.038
- Jordan,

01:00:44.304 --> 01:00:45.637
can you hear me?

01:00:59.207 --> 01:01:01.624
We're gonna get through this.

01:01:05.737 --> 01:01:07.320
It's gonna be okay.

01:01:12.165 --> 01:01:13.415
I'm right here.

01:01:27.121 --> 01:01:29.788
(soft buzzing)

01:01:38.813 --> 01:01:41.396
(tense music)

01:01:42.504 --> 01:01:43.337
Jordan.

01:01:43.337 --> 01:01:45.920
(dog barking)

01:01:50.593 --> 01:01:53.931
(Jordan gurgling)

01:01:53.931 --> 01:01:58.098
If there is an evil presence
inside of this body,

01:01:59.685 --> 01:02:01.685
I'm speaking to you now.

01:02:07.276 --> 01:02:09.359
I'm giving you a warning.

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:14.678
It is in your best interest to leave now.

01:02:14.678 --> 01:02:15.928
Release Jordan.

01:02:17.436 --> 01:02:20.269
(Jordan gasping)

01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:23.537
Do you hear me, huh?

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:28.504
Do you hear me in there?

01:02:28.504 --> 01:02:31.025
- [Jordan] I feel sick.

01:02:31.025 --> 01:02:31.858
- Jordan,

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.193
leave us.

01:02:36.901 --> 01:02:38.568
Go be safe with God.

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:42.230
I wanna speak with the demon now.

01:02:44.776 --> 01:02:47.247
Reveal yourself you fag demon.

01:02:47.247 --> 01:02:50.080
(Jordan gasping)

01:02:53.987 --> 01:02:56.487
I pierce you with God's sword.

01:02:59.035 --> 01:03:02.324
You want me so bad come out and get me.

01:03:02.324 --> 01:03:05.845
(Jordan muttering)

01:03:05.845 --> 01:03:07.529
What was that?

01:03:07.529 --> 01:03:11.696
I can't hear you is your mouth
too full of Satan's penis?

01:03:15.705 --> 01:03:16.538
Hey.

01:03:24.205 --> 01:03:26.872
Submit yourself therefore to God.

01:03:26.872 --> 01:03:29.775
Resist the devil and
he will flee from you.

01:03:29.775 --> 01:03:32.714
Draw nigh to God and he
will draw nigh to you.

01:03:32.714 --> 01:03:34.808
Cleanse your hands ye sinners,

01:03:34.808 --> 01:03:37.774
and purify your hearts ye double minded.

01:03:37.774 --> 01:03:40.837
Be afflicted and mourn and weep.

01:03:40.837 --> 01:03:43.473
Let your laughter be turned to mourning

01:03:43.473 --> 01:03:45.493
and your joy to heaviness.

01:03:45.493 --> 01:03:48.150
Humble yourself in the sight of the Lord,

01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:50.366
and he shall lift you up.

01:03:50.366 --> 01:03:52.949
(tense music)

01:04:21.711 --> 01:04:22.878
Get off of me.

01:04:26.667 --> 01:04:28.417
- Is everything okay?

01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:33.717
I heard shouts when I was in the kitchen.

01:04:33.717 --> 01:04:35.231
I didn't know if

01:04:35.231 --> 01:04:37.652
there was something wrong.
- Grab that belt.

01:04:37.652 --> 01:04:39.903
You secure his wrists.

01:04:39.903 --> 01:04:41.070
I'll hold him.

01:04:47.622 --> 01:04:49.053
Loop it around.

01:04:49.053 --> 01:04:49.886
Tighter.

01:04:51.431 --> 01:04:52.264
Kara.

01:04:53.775 --> 01:04:55.002
That's good.

01:04:55.002 --> 01:04:57.169
You can go close the door.

01:04:58.554 --> 01:05:01.387
(Jordan gasping)

01:05:09.641 --> 01:05:11.141
You're not Jordan.

01:05:16.449 --> 01:05:18.324
What's your name?

01:05:18.324 --> 01:05:20.017
Look at me.

01:05:20.017 --> 01:05:21.517
What is your name?

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:26.754
What is your name?

01:05:35.313 --> 01:05:37.980
- You look nice tonight, Elijah.

01:05:40.013 --> 01:05:42.072
- What is your name?

01:05:42.072 --> 01:05:44.405
- What do you want it to be?

01:05:45.857 --> 01:05:47.940
- What authority do you
have over this body?

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:48.773
- None.

01:05:50.286 --> 01:05:51.953
I have no authority.

01:05:53.455 --> 01:05:55.474
- Then I command you to release Jordan,

01:05:55.474 --> 01:05:59.162
and go back to the burning
pits of hell where you belong.

01:05:59.162 --> 01:06:00.995
- Good I want to burn.

01:06:03.856 --> 01:06:05.803
- You want to leave this body?

01:06:05.803 --> 01:06:09.053
- I want you to come inside and get me.

01:06:10.385 --> 01:06:12.135
There's a difference.

01:06:13.231 --> 01:06:15.311
- Well, that should be easy.

01:06:15.311 --> 01:06:17.906
You're not a very strong demon are you?

01:06:17.906 --> 01:06:19.447
- No.

01:06:19.447 --> 01:06:20.966
No, I'm not.

01:06:20.966 --> 01:06:22.956
I'm powerless

01:06:22.956 --> 01:06:25.873
and useless, defenseless, helpless.

01:06:27.354 --> 01:06:29.876
- Jesus' love will destroy you.

01:06:29.876 --> 01:06:30.709
- Will it.

01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:33.915
- God is in charge.

01:06:33.915 --> 01:06:35.256
- That sounds good.

01:06:35.256 --> 01:06:37.729
Play God take charge.

01:06:37.729 --> 01:06:41.098
- [Eli] I release Jordan say it.

01:06:41.098 --> 01:06:41.931
- No.

01:06:43.722 --> 01:06:45.722
- I will receive say it.

01:06:51.937 --> 01:06:53.770
I will receive say it.

01:06:56.603 --> 01:06:58.252
Say it.

01:06:58.252 --> 01:06:59.194
- No.

01:06:59.194 --> 01:07:00.611
- I will receive.

01:07:01.717 --> 01:07:03.870
- I will receive.

01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:05.120
I will receive.

01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:09.370
- God's judgment say it.

01:07:10.935 --> 01:07:11.768
- Make me.

01:07:14.281 --> 01:07:15.368
Make me.
- Say it.

01:07:15.368 --> 01:07:16.870
- Make me.
- I will

01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:18.344
fucking make you.

01:07:18.344 --> 01:07:20.927
(tense music)

01:07:22.561 --> 01:07:24.394
Is this what you want?

01:07:25.524 --> 01:07:29.524
I break your curse of
defilement and perversion.

01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:38.359
I reject Satan's power,

01:07:38.359 --> 01:07:42.277
and replace it with the
redeeming blood of Christ.

01:07:42.277 --> 01:07:44.971
The Holy Spirit demands it.

01:07:44.971 --> 01:07:46.483
Jesus wills it.

01:07:46.483 --> 01:07:48.172
God commands it.

01:07:48.172 --> 01:07:50.755
(tense music)

01:07:58.148 --> 01:07:59.148
Release him.

01:08:02.261 --> 01:08:03.511
Release Jordan.

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:10.513
- Eli.

01:08:12.117 --> 01:08:12.950
- Jordan.

01:08:16.295 --> 01:08:19.212
(heavy breathing)

01:08:47.515 --> 01:08:50.265
♫ Love lifted me

01:08:53.136 --> 01:08:55.886
♫ Love lifted me

01:08:58.759 --> 01:09:02.676
♫ When nothing else would help

01:09:04.738 --> 01:09:07.488
♫ Love lifted me

01:09:10.548 --> 01:09:13.298
♫ Love lifted me

01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:18.930
♫ Love lifted me

01:09:21.834 --> 01:09:25.751
♫ When nothing else could help

01:09:29.912 --> 01:09:31.416
- [Eli] Hey, tell me the truth.

01:09:31.416 --> 01:09:32.694
- What.

01:09:32.694 --> 01:09:34.264
- I picked the wrong song.

01:09:34.264 --> 01:09:36.517
- What, no way it was perfect.

01:09:36.517 --> 01:09:37.608
- Yeah, but I thought of like

01:09:37.608 --> 01:09:39.689
10 better ones like right after.

01:09:39.689 --> 01:09:42.394
- Stop seriously it was awesome.

01:09:42.394 --> 01:09:45.542
- Hey, have you seen Ascencion?

01:09:45.542 --> 01:09:47.059
She never misses Sunday service.

01:09:47.059 --> 01:09:48.487
I'm a little worried about her.

01:09:48.487 --> 01:09:51.022
- No, when's the last time you talked

01:09:51.022 --> 01:09:53.104
- Someone's following me.

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:56.613
- Jesus is following you.

01:09:56.613 --> 01:10:00.037
He follows you to protect
and watch over you.

01:10:00.037 --> 01:10:03.043
Jordan, would you like to lead
us in a prayer for Pamela?

01:10:03.043 --> 01:10:03.876
- Yeah.

01:10:14.837 --> 01:10:15.837
- Good call.

01:10:16.708 --> 01:10:19.623
Getting kind of chubby anyway.

01:10:19.623 --> 01:10:22.837
- You know I was thinking Psalms 28

01:10:22.837 --> 01:10:25.664
would have been a stronger choice.

01:10:25.664 --> 01:10:26.611
- Are you serious.

01:10:26.611 --> 01:10:28.361
- Yeah, or Psalms 68.

01:10:29.426 --> 01:10:31.818
Give us your strength
as you have done before.

01:10:31.818 --> 01:10:32.868
- Are you serious or are you joking.

01:10:32.868 --> 01:10:35.590
- Really any other Psalms would
have been a better choice.

01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:37.927
Than the one you chose (laughing).

01:10:37.927 --> 01:10:39.510
Whoa, Eli, stop it.

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.977
Get off me, Eli.
(woman screaming)

01:10:44.977 --> 01:10:47.560
(tense music)

01:10:48.598 --> 01:10:50.515
- I'll call the police.

01:10:57.601 --> 01:10:59.443
- I'm calling my mom.

01:10:59.443 --> 01:11:00.843
- Why?

01:11:00.843 --> 01:11:02.496
- So she can pick me up.

01:11:02.496 --> 01:11:03.481
I wanna go home.

01:11:03.481 --> 01:11:04.314
- Kara.

01:11:04.314 --> 01:11:06.481
- Someone give me a phone.

01:11:13.216 --> 01:11:14.049
- Okay.

01:11:15.311 --> 01:11:17.228
I understand thank you.

01:11:21.656 --> 01:11:22.910
It's not an actual emergency,

01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:24.723
so if we wanna make a report,

01:11:24.723 --> 01:11:25.705
we have to take some photos

01:11:25.705 --> 01:11:28.578
and go down to the station ourselves.

01:11:28.578 --> 01:11:30.648
- Should we all go together?

01:11:30.648 --> 01:11:33.335
- Maybe someone should stay here.

01:11:33.335 --> 01:11:35.585
- I think we should all go.

01:11:36.429 --> 01:11:37.694
I don't think there's any real danger,

01:11:37.694 --> 01:11:41.204
but it's best to be on the safe side.

01:11:41.204 --> 01:11:42.537
- My mom's here.

01:12:33.022 --> 01:12:34.189
- Hey, Jordan

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:38.179
can you go check my jeans for my keys.

01:12:38.179 --> 01:12:40.099
I'm gonna snap a few
photos then we can go.

01:12:40.099 --> 01:12:41.182
- Yeah, sure.

01:12:59.005 --> 01:13:00.947
- [Lindsay] I just don't feel
safe with him around anymore.

01:13:00.947 --> 01:13:02.280
I can't help it.

01:13:03.227 --> 01:13:06.310
- Lindsay, I saw the demon leave him.

01:13:07.353 --> 01:13:08.859
He doesn't even remember it happening.

01:13:08.859 --> 01:13:12.740
What's happening right now
has nothing to do with him.

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:14.383
- At least tell me that
you're not going to

01:13:14.383 --> 01:13:16.288
share a bed with him again.

01:13:16.288 --> 01:13:18.177
- What does that have to do with anything?

01:13:18.177 --> 01:13:20.255
Yeah, I don't see why not.

01:13:20.255 --> 01:13:21.255
- Seriously.

01:13:24.255 --> 01:13:25.088
- Hey.

01:13:27.271 --> 01:13:32.163
We're gonna share a bed
together someday you and me.

01:13:32.163 --> 01:13:32.996
I promise.

01:13:33.985 --> 01:13:35.318
- You mean that.

01:13:36.726 --> 01:13:38.742
- You bet I do.

01:13:38.742 --> 01:13:43.376
But until then don't make me
sleep on a lumpy old couch.

01:13:43.376 --> 01:13:44.209
- Okay.

01:13:47.628 --> 01:13:50.461
(glass breaking)

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:56.052
(Jordan growling)

01:13:56.052 --> 01:13:57.141
- Lindsay,

01:13:57.141 --> 01:13:58.084
Stop.

01:13:58.084 --> 01:13:59.746
Help me get him to the bedroom.

01:13:59.746 --> 01:14:02.559
Run ahead and open the door.

01:14:02.559 --> 01:14:05.392
(Jordan gasping)

01:14:08.595 --> 01:14:11.595
Find something to restrain him with.

01:14:13.408 --> 01:14:14.900
I thought we got rid of you.

01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:17.077
- No, never, never.

01:14:17.077 --> 01:14:18.519
- You are going to learn to do

01:14:18.519 --> 01:14:21.145
what I as a man of God say.

01:14:21.145 --> 01:14:22.916
(tense music)

01:14:22.916 --> 01:14:24.792
- [Lindsay] Will this work?

01:14:24.792 --> 01:14:28.154
- I'll hold him down you tie him.

01:14:28.154 --> 01:14:29.321
Tie him tight.

01:14:31.178 --> 01:14:34.178
(Jordan muttering)

01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:40.040
Grab that belt.

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:49.697
You can leave now.

01:14:49.697 --> 01:14:51.245
- No way I'm staying.

01:14:51.245 --> 01:14:52.888
- Leave.

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:53.721
Leave.

01:14:54.769 --> 01:14:56.102
- She's staying.

01:14:57.171 --> 01:14:59.301
Hey, look at me.

01:14:59.301 --> 01:15:04.250
- Eli, what's happening to (slapping).

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:07.893
- I will receive God's judgment say it.

01:15:07.893 --> 01:15:08.810
- Fuck you.

01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:13.509
- I release him and return
to the fiery pit say it.

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:15.314
- There is no pit.

01:15:15.314 --> 01:15:16.564
- I will leave.

01:15:19.468 --> 01:15:24.032
Lindsay, grab that cross
from the living room.

01:15:24.032 --> 01:15:26.720
(tense music)

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:29.637
(heavy breathing)

01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:54.540
(Jordan muttering)

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:07.026
Spirit of perversion come out.

01:16:07.026 --> 01:16:09.644
Come out in the name of Jesus.

01:16:09.644 --> 01:16:11.125
- Come out.

01:16:11.125 --> 01:16:13.936
Leave this body and return to the pit.

01:16:13.936 --> 01:16:15.603
- I am light say it.

01:16:18.215 --> 01:16:22.215
I release Jordan and
return to the pit say it.

01:16:23.230 --> 01:16:24.647
I release Jordan.

01:16:28.051 --> 01:16:29.771
- No.

01:16:29.771 --> 01:16:30.604
No.

01:16:34.499 --> 01:16:37.808
- Lindsay, get a belt
or something stronger.

01:16:37.808 --> 01:16:39.900
I don't know if I can hold him.

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:41.472
Lindsay.

01:16:41.472 --> 01:16:42.305
- Stop.

01:16:43.186 --> 01:16:45.250
(tense music)

01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:46.500
- Give me that.

01:16:48.508 --> 01:16:49.913
Tie him again

01:16:49.913 --> 01:16:51.413
tighter this time.

01:16:55.665 --> 01:16:59.298
Turn over so she can tie your hands.

01:16:59.298 --> 01:17:02.131
(Jordan gasping)

01:17:03.561 --> 01:17:06.311
(Jordan crying)

01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:13.830
- Eli, help me.

01:17:17.173 --> 01:17:18.725
Eli, please.
- Jordan.

01:17:18.725 --> 01:17:19.924
- Don't listen to it.

01:17:19.924 --> 01:17:21.846
It's just the demon trying to fool you.

01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:23.434
- Filthy sex demon.

01:17:23.434 --> 01:17:24.749
Show it, Eli.

01:17:24.749 --> 01:17:26.796
Take the sword of the spirit
and cut right through it.

01:17:26.796 --> 01:17:28.609
Show it that if it doesn't
come out on it's own

01:17:28.609 --> 01:17:30.499
we're going to go in after it.

01:17:30.499 --> 01:17:32.154
Show it, show it.

01:17:32.154 --> 01:17:35.553
- I have committed perverse
thoughts and actions,

01:17:35.553 --> 01:17:38.806
and I am ready to receive
God's judgment say it.

01:17:38.806 --> 01:17:42.209
- I have committed
perverse thoughts and acts.

01:17:42.209 --> 01:17:45.459
- Ready to receive God judgment say it.

01:17:46.405 --> 01:17:49.262
- I am ready to receive (screaming)

01:17:49.262 --> 01:17:51.139
- God, release it.

01:17:51.139 --> 01:17:52.056
Release it.

01:17:54.106 --> 01:17:55.588
- Come out demon.

01:17:55.588 --> 01:17:58.314
I release you with God's power.

01:17:58.314 --> 01:18:00.105
I spill your diseased blood,

01:18:00.105 --> 01:18:02.854
and fill you up with the spirit.

01:18:02.854 --> 01:18:04.638
I spill your perversion,

01:18:04.638 --> 01:18:07.436
and fill you with the spirit.

01:18:07.436 --> 01:18:10.436
(Jordan screaming)

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:42.197
(Jordan mumbling)

01:18:46.971 --> 01:18:49.721
(Jordan crying)

01:19:20.145 --> 01:19:21.073
- I'm telling you Jordan

01:19:21.073 --> 01:19:22.866
is the one responsible for the goat head.

01:19:22.866 --> 01:19:24.663
I mean you can see what he's capable of.

01:19:24.663 --> 01:19:27.500
He's completely manifested.

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:30.451
I think we should call your dad.

01:19:30.451 --> 01:19:33.970
- I think we should spend some
time in quiet contemplation.

01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:35.553
- Of course you do.

01:19:37.757 --> 01:19:40.626
- I'm gonna take a shower, okay.

01:19:40.626 --> 01:19:44.793
Why don't you make yourself
some tea or something.

01:19:48.959 --> 01:19:52.959
We'll figure out what
we're gonna do after that.

01:19:56.055 --> 01:19:58.638
(dog barking)

01:20:03.664 --> 01:20:04.767
(tense music)

01:20:04.767 --> 01:20:07.600
(water splashing)

01:20:13.863 --> 01:20:16.113
- Did you get our messages?

01:20:19.568 --> 01:20:22.985
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:27.042
- Ascencion won't be
coming back here anymore.

01:20:27.042 --> 01:20:30.336
Blanca won't be coming back here anymore.

01:20:30.336 --> 01:20:31.669
If you're very,

01:20:32.810 --> 01:20:36.893
very careful I won't be
coming back here anymore.

01:20:38.861 --> 01:20:41.861
You know what I'm talking about now?

01:20:48.412 --> 01:20:51.495
(suspenseful music)

01:21:17.533 --> 01:21:21.700
(Jordan gasping)
(Lindsay screaming)

01:21:27.171 --> 01:21:30.088
(Lindsay gasping)

01:21:34.807 --> 01:21:35.640
- No.

01:21:43.868 --> 01:21:44.701
(Lindsay screaming)

01:21:44.701 --> 01:21:47.034
(loud thud)

01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:07.809
(water splashing)

01:22:07.809 --> 01:22:10.978
(tense music)

01:22:10.978 --> 01:22:14.228
(Eli singing faintly)

01:22:20.737 --> 01:22:24.162
♫ Jesus keep me from all harm

01:22:24.162 --> 01:22:27.995
♫ Jesus kept me from all harm

01:22:31.305 --> 01:22:33.748
♫ I'll be satisfied as long

01:22:33.748 --> 01:22:37.415
♫ I'll be satisfied as long

01:22:41.551 --> 01:22:43.884
♫ As I walk

01:22:44.905 --> 01:22:47.405
♫ Let me walk

01:22:48.331 --> 01:22:50.914
♫ Close to you

01:23:02.914 --> 01:23:05.747
(door squeaking)

01:23:13.208 --> 01:23:16.458
- I command you to get back on the bed.

01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:40.261
(tense music)

01:23:40.261 --> 01:23:41.710
- Jordan.

01:23:41.710 --> 01:23:42.986
Jordan, stop.

01:23:42.986 --> 01:23:44.069
Jordan, stop.

01:23:44.988 --> 01:23:46.870
Jordan, wait, wait.

01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:49.172
Jordan, Jordan no.

01:23:49.172 --> 01:23:50.089
Jordan, no.

01:23:51.012 --> 01:23:52.355
Jordan.

01:23:52.355 --> 01:23:53.660
Jordan.

01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:55.176
No, son.

01:23:55.176 --> 01:23:57.476
No, son I'm speaking to Jordan now.

01:23:57.476 --> 01:24:00.451
Jordan, I'm speaking to Jordan now.

01:24:00.451 --> 01:24:01.451
Please stop.

01:24:02.623 --> 01:24:03.773
Stop (crying).

01:24:03.773 --> 01:24:06.744
Jordan, I need you please just leave.

01:24:06.744 --> 01:24:10.070
(screaming) Fuck, Jordan.

01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:12.395
Stop what are you doing.

01:24:12.395 --> 01:24:13.478
No, no, stop.

01:24:15.324 --> 01:24:16.157
Jordan.

01:24:18.848 --> 01:24:21.515
(Eli screaming)

01:24:24.718 --> 01:24:27.135
(Eli crying)

01:24:29.412 --> 01:24:32.829
No, Jordan, no (crying).

01:24:38.739 --> 01:24:39.898
Stop.

01:24:39.898 --> 01:24:42.481
(tense music)

01:24:59.473 --> 01:25:01.973
(Eli crying)

01:25:41.095 --> 01:25:41.928
Jordan.

01:25:48.651 --> 01:25:49.818
I forgive you.

01:26:08.286 --> 01:26:09.619
Let me help you.

01:26:20.506 --> 01:26:21.589
Pray with me.

01:26:35.901 --> 01:26:38.484
(tense music)

01:26:43.082 --> 01:26:48.065
♫ In the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb

01:26:48.065 --> 01:26:50.533
♫ Are your garments spotless

01:26:50.533 --> 01:26:53.052
♫ Are they white as snow

01:26:53.052 --> 01:26:57.219
♫ Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb

01:26:58.128 --> 01:27:03.002
♫ Lay aside the garments
that are stained with sin

01:27:03.002 --> 01:27:07.169
♫ And be washed in the blood of the Lamb

01:27:08.192 --> 01:27:13.188
♫ There's a fountain
flowing for the soul unclean

01:27:13.188 --> 01:27:17.355
♫ Go be washed in the blood of the Lamb

01:27:18.351 --> 01:27:20.811
♫ Are you washed

01:27:20.811 --> 01:27:23.355
♫ In the blood

01:27:23.355 --> 01:27:28.317
♫ In the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb

01:27:28.317 --> 01:27:30.910
♫ Are your garments spotless

01:27:30.910 --> 01:27:33.348
♫ Are they white as snow

01:27:33.348 --> 01:27:37.515
♫ Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb

01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:42.557
(soft guitar strumming)

01:28:21.905 --> 01:28:24.655
(dramatic music)

01:28:25.305 --> 01:28:31.515
