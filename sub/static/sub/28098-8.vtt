01:09.269 --> 01:10.812
Cabrera, what's the status?

01:10.836 --> 01:12.814
Surveillance is up
and operators are in position.

01:12.838 --> 01:14.281
Any chatter on local police channels?

01:14.305 --> 01:15.382
None.

01:15.406 --> 01:16.731
Any abnormal activity on the site?

01:16.755 --> 01:18.124
Haibach and Villareal
have been monitoring

01:18.148 --> 01:19.212
the building all morning.

01:19.236 --> 01:21.083
They've reported nothing.

01:21.107 --> 01:22.868
We're clear to proceed if you are.

01:25.721 --> 01:27.873
- We're a go.
- All right, let's go.

01:32.380 --> 01:35.576
All right, Des, CCTV feeds
inside the building are up.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.323
Langley's given us the green light.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.416
Copy that.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.189
Remember what we're fighting for here.

01:40.213 --> 01:41.930
These passport papers
are the key to finding Tal.

01:41.954 --> 01:43.845
So be safe, but no mistakes.

01:43.869 --> 01:46.892
Understood. I'm going in now.

01:56.360 --> 01:57.555
All right.

02:01.496 --> 02:04.083
Looks like we've got four guards total.

02:04.107 --> 02:05.476
You just passed one.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.622
There another one the ground level

02:06.646 --> 02:08.130
at the end of the hall.

02:14.552 --> 02:17.816
Upstairs you have two on your right.

02:22.821 --> 02:24.954
Sarah, push in on four.

02:39.185 --> 02:40.695
_

02:49.544 --> 02:50.651
Da.

02:56.072 --> 02:58.529
Files are in aisle six,
fourth row from the bottom,

02:58.553 --> 03:02.141
ID number 17143.

03:10.782 --> 03:13.282
Great. Let's go.

03:13.306 --> 03:16.111
_

03:24.230 --> 03:26.494
_

03:32.543 --> 03:33.651
Stay calm.

03:44.694 --> 03:46.694
_

04:04.594 --> 04:06.564
_

04:19.938 --> 04:22.526
You've been made. Get out. Get out now.

04:41.612 --> 04:42.981
Give me cameras on the first floor.

04:43.005 --> 04:45.287
I want to find the other two guards now.

04:45.311 --> 04:47.725
_

04:47.749 --> 04:48.856
You have one guard in front of you,

04:48.880 --> 04:49.901
one to your left.

04:57.236 --> 04:58.649
Des, are you hit?

04:58.673 --> 05:00.085
- No.
- Can you get out?

05:00.109 --> 05:01.763
I don't know.

05:04.722 --> 05:05.941
Go now.

05:19.911 --> 05:21.628
Des, are you out?

05:21.909 --> 05:23.536
Did she get out?

05:24.481 --> 05:26.135
Haibach, stand by to get the case.

05:34.970 --> 05:37.339
Des, do you read anything?
Des, are you out?

05:39.061 --> 05:40.908
This is Villareal. I'm in the van.

05:40.932 --> 05:42.805
We're leaving the site now.

05:45.981 --> 05:47.306
Do you have the papers with you?

05:47.330 --> 05:48.742
Sitting in my lap.

05:48.766 --> 05:50.701
Good. Good work. Good work.

05:50.725 --> 05:51.963
We're gonna work on your extraction plan

05:51.987 --> 05:53.486
and we'll have you home in 24 hours.

05:53.510 --> 05:55.793
- Well done.
- Looking forward to it, ma'am.

05:57.819 --> 05:59.864
- Congratulations, Erica.
- Yeah.

06:00.386 --> 06:02.800
Those passport documents are
the key to Tal's inner circle.

06:02.824 --> 06:04.497
This is a huge win for the agency.

06:04.521 --> 06:05.629
We got him. Well done.

06:05.653 --> 06:07.631
Yeah. Good job, guys.

06:07.655 --> 06:08.719
Keep it up. Let's get them home.

06:08.743 --> 06:12.620
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

06:15.053 --> 06:16.640
- Morning.
- Good morning.

06:16.664 --> 06:18.250
What are you eating for breakfast?

06:18.274 --> 06:19.294
An energy bar.

06:19.318 --> 06:20.992
That's a candy bar in gym clothes.

06:21.016 --> 06:23.081
- You should eat eggs.
- Why don't you make me some?

06:23.105 --> 06:24.735
I'll learn how to cook them tomorrow.

06:24.759 --> 06:25.823
Come on, let's go. We're late.

06:25.847 --> 06:27.694
Hurry up and I'll let you drive.

06:27.718 --> 06:30.001
- Really?
- No.

06:30.025 --> 06:32.003
- Mom.
- Someday.

06:32.027 --> 06:34.527
Not my car. Let's go.

06:34.551 --> 06:36.137
Are you sure you can't pick me up?

06:36.161 --> 06:38.183
Why do you want me to pick you up?

06:38.207 --> 06:40.315
Because when dad does it
he gets there, like,

06:40.339 --> 06:41.621
half an hour early.

06:41.645 --> 06:43.928
- So?
- So, he watches me play.

06:43.952 --> 06:45.625
And then on the way home
he tells me, like,

06:45.649 --> 06:47.018
every little thing I did wrong.

06:47.042 --> 06:49.324
Well, I'm sure he's just trying to help.

06:49.348 --> 06:51.979
I know, but he doesn't really
know what he's talking about.

06:52.416 --> 06:53.851
He played high school sports.

06:53.875 --> 06:55.896
He played golf, Mom. It doesn't count.

06:58.488 --> 07:00.858
Closing the embassy in Yemen
will force CIA

07:00.882 --> 07:03.208
to drastically reduce
its operations there.

07:03.232 --> 07:05.863
Houthi rebels are threatening
to take over the government.

07:05.887 --> 07:07.765
We don't have a choice, Erica.

07:08.933 --> 07:10.476
Then neither does CIA.

07:10.500 --> 07:13.218
I'm leaving now.
State Department's not budging.

07:13.604 --> 07:15.002
No, I have to be on the Hill

07:15.026 --> 07:16.700
with the House Intelligence
Committee at noon.

07:16.724 --> 07:18.876
Also, would you confirm that
Cabrera's monitoring

07:18.900 --> 07:20.573
Haibach and Villareal's extraction?

07:20.597 --> 07:23.532
I want no complications there.
Understood?

07:25.384 --> 07:27.232
Erica? Erica!

07:27.256 --> 07:28.973
- You left your phone.
- Oh.

07:28.997 --> 07:30.583
I had to answer it. The school called.

07:30.607 --> 07:32.373
Hannah didn't show up today.

07:33.784 --> 07:35.376
I dropped her off.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.529
Hello, Erica.

08:04.572 --> 08:07.098
I'm watching your daughter.

08:07.122 --> 08:08.273
Tal?

08:08.297 --> 08:10.362
She is a beautiful girl.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.998
You should be very proud.

08:15.521 --> 08:17.151
I want their names.

08:17.175 --> 08:20.807
The four CIA operatives
who stopped those bombings.

08:20.831 --> 08:22.156
Don't hurt her.

08:22.180 --> 08:24.724
That isn't my decision to make.

08:24.748 --> 08:26.639
It's yours.

08:26.663 --> 08:29.816
It's up to you whether your
daughter dies today or not.

08:31.537 --> 08:33.515
- It's a simple choice...
- Can we talk?

08:33.539 --> 08:36.301
It's your daughter's life or theirs.

08:36.325 --> 08:37.736
Wait, wait!

08:37.760 --> 08:39.304
Five,

08:39.328 --> 08:42.001
- four...
- Just stop counting!

08:42.025 --> 08:45.832
Three, two, one.

08:45.856 --> 08:47.834
Steven Haibach, Brian Lanich,

08:47.858 --> 08:51.410
Desiree Villareal, Laine Heffron!

08:52.471 --> 08:54.038
Thank you.

08:55.823 --> 09:00.586
Tal! Tal!

09:02.699 --> 09:05.257
Tal!

09:06.311 --> 09:07.462
Tal!

09:22.937 --> 09:25.219
Hi, this is Hannah. Leave me a message.

09:28.681 --> 09:30.466
Hi, this is Hannah.

10:56.073 --> 10:57.181
Hannah?

10:58.467 --> 10:59.816
Hannah?

11:06.605 --> 11:08.422
Hannah, are you in here?

11:11.088 --> 11:12.413
Hannah?

11:16.354 --> 11:18.202
What do you want?

11:18.226 --> 11:19.246
I'm looking for my daughter.

11:19.270 --> 11:20.595
Have you seen her?

11:20.619 --> 11:22.032
You're not supposed to be in here.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.555
- Have you seen her?
- I ain't seen nothing.

11:23.579 --> 11:24.773
Her phone is here. Why is her phone here?

11:24.797 --> 11:26.384
Look like I got a phone?

11:57.874 --> 11:59.678
My daughter is missing. She's 13.

11:59.702 --> 12:02.289
She has a pink backpack.
Have you seen her?

12:02.313 --> 12:04.813
I'm looking for my daughter.
Have you seen her?

12:04.837 --> 12:05.989
Thank you.

12:09.103 --> 12:10.645
Have you seen this girl?

12:13.324 --> 12:16.521
Excuse me. My daughter is missing.

12:16.545 --> 12:18.392
She has light brown hair.
She's 13 years old.

12:18.416 --> 12:19.654
Have you seen her?

12:19.678 --> 12:20.655
Was she wearing a pink backpack?

12:20.679 --> 12:22.005
Yes, where is she?

12:22.029 --> 12:23.441
I don't know, but she was sitting

12:23.465 --> 12:25.660
on that bench over there.

12:25.684 --> 12:27.488
- Do you know where she went?
- She left.

12:27.512 --> 12:29.099
- With the police.
- What?

12:29.123 --> 12:31.318
Two officers took her and drove away.

12:33.170 --> 12:34.679
Thank you.

12:34.703 --> 12:36.802
Bethesda Police Department.
How may I direct your call?

12:36.826 --> 12:38.412
My daughter was picked up
by two police officers

12:38.436 --> 12:39.979
at Virginia Park.

12:40.003 --> 12:41.589
Can you tell me exactly what happened?

12:41.613 --> 12:43.026
My daughter is missing.

12:43.050 --> 12:44.679
Someone told me that she was
picked up by two

12:44.703 --> 12:46.855
police officers.
I need to know where she is.

12:46.879 --> 12:48.074
Did you get the names of the officers?

12:48.098 --> 12:49.249
No.

12:49.273 --> 12:50.468
Okay, let me check with our units.

12:50.492 --> 12:51.592
Please hold.

12:56.193 --> 12:58.128
- Ma'am, are you there?
- Yes, yes.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.781
What park did you say it was?

12:59.805 --> 13:01.957
Virginia Park! Third Street.

13:01.981 --> 13:04.656
It couldn't have been more
than ten minutes ago.

13:04.680 --> 13:07.180
I'm sorry but there's no
record of any of our officers

13:07.204 --> 13:08.877
- picking up a minor.
- That's impossible.

13:08.901 --> 13:10.357
- Check again.
- I did.

13:10.381 --> 13:12.098
Check again!

13:12.122 --> 13:13.404
I did, ma'am.

13:13.428 --> 13:15.493
None of our officers have your daughter.

13:15.517 --> 13:16.765
What's her name?

13:16.789 --> 13:20.106
I can file a missing persons
report and issue an Amber Alert.

13:22.611 --> 13:24.545
- He has her.
- What?

13:24.569 --> 13:26.069
Who has her?

13:33.651 --> 13:35.600
- It's Shepherd.
- Erica, where have you been?

13:35.624 --> 13:37.210
Been trying to get a hold of you.

13:37.234 --> 13:39.908
- What is it?
- It's Haibach and Villareal.

13:39.932 --> 13:41.562
They picked up suspicious activity

13:41.586 --> 13:42.998
outside the safe house.

13:43.022 --> 13:44.652
I think they might be in trouble.

13:45.162 --> 13:46.611
Have you heard anything?

13:49.594 --> 13:50.702
Erica, have you heard anything?

13:50.726 --> 13:52.711
- No.
- Are you sure?

13:53.250 --> 13:55.576
No you have any reason to believe
they might be compromised?

13:58.168 --> 13:59.145
No.

13:59.169 --> 14:00.761
How do you want to proceed?

14:05.654 --> 14:09.266
Pull them out. Pull them out now.

14:36.508 --> 14:37.575
Down!

14:37.599 --> 14:38.793
Oh, down! Down!

14:38.817 --> 14:39.794
Down!

14:45.259 --> 14:46.627
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

15:41.924 --> 15:43.597
- What's going on?
- They're not responding.

15:43.621 --> 15:45.817
- Who?
- Villareal and Haibach.

15:45.841 --> 15:47.471
We gave them instructions
to leave the safe house,

15:47.495 --> 15:48.599
but they haven't checked in.

15:48.623 --> 15:49.821
Did you try their cell?

15:49.845 --> 15:51.605
- Yeah.
- What about the sat phone?

15:51.629 --> 15:53.390
I tried both. No answer.

15:53.414 --> 15:55.392
Contact our assets in Zagreb.

15:55.416 --> 15:57.002
I don't care who it is,

15:57.026 --> 16:00.047
you get someone to their
location as soon as possible.

16:28.231 --> 16:30.296
- Yeah?
- Bring her to me.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.428
Okay.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.571
- Shepherd.
- They're gone.

16:44.595 --> 16:47.010
- Who?
- Haibach and Villareal.

16:47.803 --> 16:49.184
They're dead.

16:49.208 --> 16:51.883
They went dark right after
we tried to pull them out.

16:51.907 --> 16:54.712
Our asset on the ground in
Zagreb found them shot to death

16:54.736 --> 16:56.888
in their car outside the safe house.

16:56.912 --> 16:59.673
They're dead, Erica. Both of them.

16:59.697 --> 17:01.066
It's Tal.

17:01.090 --> 17:02.734
How do you know?

17:11.318 --> 17:13.339
God!

17:22.502 --> 17:24.698
- What is it?
- Brian Lanich.

17:24.722 --> 17:26.787
We can't get a hold of him.

17:48.529 --> 17:50.115
- This is Cabrera.
- Listen to me.

17:50.139 --> 17:51.508
There's been foreign chatter.

17:51.532 --> 17:53.597
I think one of our teams
has been compromised.

17:53.621 --> 17:55.686
Haibach, Villareal, Lanich, and Heffron.

17:55.710 --> 17:58.428
They all helped me stop
the Logan Airport bombing.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.125
Get word to them wherever they are,

18:00.149 --> 18:01.431
whatever they are doing,

18:01.455 --> 18:02.780
you get them to safety immediately.

18:02.804 --> 18:05.609
Are you hearing me? Whatever it takes.

18:05.633 --> 18:06.871
Now.

19:14.919 --> 19:17.507
Stop moving. Stop moving.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.247
I just stabbed you
in your carotid artery.

19:19.271 --> 19:20.814
Lis... listen to me!

19:20.838 --> 19:22.947
I just stabbed you
in your carotid artery.

19:22.971 --> 19:24.514
The only thing keeping you
from bleeding out in

19:24.538 --> 19:26.864
the next 15 seconds is my thumb.

19:28.106 --> 19:30.258
Where is my daughter?

19:36.767 --> 19:38.397
I know you work for Tal.

19:38.421 --> 19:39.877
I know he has my daughter.

19:39.901 --> 19:42.853
You tell me where she is or you die.

19:44.021 --> 19:47.711
- She's at your house.
- You are lying.

19:47.735 --> 19:51.236
Both of them, dressed as police.

19:51.260 --> 19:53.322
They took her home.

19:53.958 --> 19:55.240
Okay.

20:22.465 --> 20:24.859
Hello, Erica.

20:31.213 --> 20:32.538
Tal.

20:32.562 --> 20:35.019
Such a pleasure to finally meet you.

20:35.043 --> 20:36.281
Where's my daughter?

20:36.305 --> 20:37.658
Safe.

20:38.394 --> 20:39.676
If you hurt her, I will kill you.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.591
You are in no position to make threats.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.330
I suggest you don't.

20:44.966 --> 20:47.945
You look different in person, stronger.

20:47.969 --> 20:53.124
Odd how our opinions can shape
a person's image in our mind.

20:56.368 --> 20:57.955
Where is she?

20:57.979 --> 21:01.973
Ask again and I'll have her
eyes plucked from her skull.

21:02.810 --> 21:04.483
Do you know why I'm here?

21:04.893 --> 21:08.605
Do you know why I risked
my life to enter this country?

21:09.425 --> 21:10.732
No.

21:11.645 --> 21:14.361
It's because of you, Erica.

21:15.518 --> 21:18.949
I'm here to tell you your future.

21:19.261 --> 21:23.284
The four CIA operatives
who work for you will die.

21:23.308 --> 21:26.113
There is nothing you can do
to change that.

21:26.137 --> 21:30.553
And soon your country will know
your part in their deaths.

21:30.577 --> 21:33.817
You'll be arrested as a traitor
and spend the rest of your life

21:33.841 --> 21:37.676
locked in a cage like a dog.

21:38.149 --> 21:41.596
Your country will despise
your very existence.

21:42.327 --> 21:45.350
And you will never see
your daughter again.

21:53.817 --> 21:58.624
That future is as inevitable as the dawn.

21:59.207 --> 22:00.495
Except through me.

22:00.519 --> 22:02.193
What do you want?

22:02.217 --> 22:03.410
You.

22:05.133 --> 22:08.415
You want me? You want me to work for you?

22:08.963 --> 22:11.768
I've had many adversaries in my life.

22:11.792 --> 22:14.858
Interpol, MI6, Mossad.

22:14.882 --> 22:17.600
But no one came close to stopping me.

22:17.624 --> 22:21.011
Not until you.

22:21.628 --> 22:23.562
And I want you to be an operative.

22:23.586 --> 22:25.564
I want you as you are.

22:25.588 --> 22:28.518
Deputy director of the CIA.

22:29.374 --> 22:32.876
Feed me intelligence.
Protect me from your country.

22:32.900 --> 22:38.577
In return,
I will save you from that cage.

22:38.601 --> 22:41.031
And your daughter will be safe forever.

22:42.779 --> 22:46.411
Don't answer now.

22:46.435 --> 22:49.893
I know anything you'll say
will merely be in service

22:49.917 --> 22:52.112
of saving your daughter. No.

22:53.877 --> 22:57.509
I want you to think...

22:57.533 --> 22:58.945
About your response.

22:58.969 --> 23:02.906
I want you to feel
the noose of incarceration

23:02.930 --> 23:05.639
tightening around your neck.

23:06.890 --> 23:10.677
Then and only then do I want your answer.

23:12.287 --> 23:14.265
You hate me.

23:14.289 --> 23:17.834
But in time, you'll see...
just as many before you have...

23:17.858 --> 23:22.645
that beyond hatred lies salvation.

23:24.560 --> 23:29.454
Your daughter is upstairs
in her room unharmed.

23:29.478 --> 23:32.065
She knows nothing about this.

23:32.089 --> 23:36.354
She simply believes she
was caught skipping school.

23:37.921 --> 23:40.204
The less she knows, the better,

23:40.228 --> 23:44.177
in case your decision
is one that pleases me.

23:46.451 --> 23:49.099
Good-bye, Erica.

23:57.114 --> 23:58.352
Hannah?

24:07.168 --> 24:11.801
I thought... I thought something
had happened to you.

24:11.825 --> 24:13.498
I'm so sorry, Mom.

24:13.522 --> 24:16.980
I just wanted to meet Dylan at
the park and I wasn't thinking.

24:17.004 --> 24:18.808
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

24:18.832 --> 24:20.714
It's okay. You're safe.

24:22.574 --> 24:23.900
What happened?

24:24.551 --> 24:26.729
Oh, I cut myself getting in the car.

24:26.753 --> 24:27.947
It's not as bad as it looks.

24:27.971 --> 24:29.819
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.766
Are you sure? Did they hurt you?

24:32.671 --> 24:35.999
No. Mom, it was the police.

24:36.023 --> 24:38.653
They saw me at the park and
asked why I wasn't at school.

24:38.677 --> 24:42.353
I didn't know what to tell them
so they brought me back home.

24:42.377 --> 24:43.528
Are you mad?

24:45.206 --> 24:47.750
No. No.

24:53.867 --> 24:55.018
I need to call the school

24:55.042 --> 24:57.237
and let them know that you're okay.

24:57.261 --> 24:59.836
- Give me one second?
- Okay.

25:19.153 --> 25:20.565
Hi, you've reached Laine Heffron.

25:20.589 --> 25:23.220
Leave a message and I'll call you back.

25:51.185 --> 25:52.771
- Daniel.
- What's up, Will?

25:52.795 --> 25:54.773
Did you follow up with
the DOJ on that Anderson case?

25:54.797 --> 25:55.992
Counter Terrorism's asking.

25:56.016 --> 25:57.602
Yeah, I spoke to them this morning.

25:57.626 --> 26:00.257
They're, uh, ready to press
ahead with espionage charges.

26:00.281 --> 26:01.475
But not homicide?

26:01.499 --> 26:03.173
No, no. They don't think we have it yet.

26:03.197 --> 26:05.449
- They wanna wait for forensics.
- Talk to the lab.

26:05.473 --> 26:07.090
- Find out what the hold up is.
- You got it.

26:07.114 --> 26:09.657
- And you still good for Saturday?
- We're looking forward to it.

26:09.681 --> 26:10.991
Major Keaton.

26:12.162 --> 26:14.619
Director Mayer.
What are you doing down here?

26:14.643 --> 26:16.099
We need to talk to you.

26:16.123 --> 26:18.101
Everything okay?

26:18.125 --> 26:19.537
Can we speak in your office?

26:32.139 --> 26:33.943
So what's going on?

26:33.967 --> 26:36.119
There's been an incident.

26:36.143 --> 26:38.817
About an hour ago we received
word that a private jet

26:38.841 --> 26:40.950
that we chartered went missing.

26:40.974 --> 26:44.649
Foreign authorities have
confirmed the jet went down.

26:44.673 --> 26:46.317
Everyone aboard was killed.

26:46.849 --> 26:48.862
So, uh... so... so what are you saying?

26:49.765 --> 26:52.178
- I'm sorry, Will.
- No.

26:52.202 --> 26:54.159
Laine was on that flight.

26:54.726 --> 26:56.036
No.

26:56.641 --> 26:57.967
No.

26:57.991 --> 27:00.665
We're so very sorry for your loss.

27:00.689 --> 27:02.145
Is there anything we can do? We...

27:02.169 --> 27:03.543
No, no, no.

28:16.417 --> 28:17.867
You sleep here last night?

28:18.723 --> 28:20.745
Not last night, no.

28:33.695 --> 28:36.369
- You know, Will, you have to...
- What, Daniel?

28:36.393 --> 28:38.197
What? What do I have to do?

28:38.638 --> 28:39.633
Hmm?

28:39.657 --> 28:41.505
Eat, sleep, take better care of myself?

28:41.529 --> 28:43.507
I mean, please,
tell me what I have to do.

28:43.531 --> 28:45.436
God knows everybody else has been.

28:46.577 --> 28:47.990
'Cause they care about you.

28:48.014 --> 28:50.775
Well, all I care about is catching

28:50.799 --> 28:52.757
the person that killed Laine.

28:54.237 --> 28:55.572
Gotta go.

28:56.109 --> 28:57.390
Where you headed?

28:57.414 --> 28:58.741
Langley.

28:59.590 --> 29:02.221
Deputy Director of the CIA is briefing me

29:02.245 --> 29:03.962
on their end of the attacks.

29:03.986 --> 29:05.422
Good.

29:08.164 --> 29:09.818
I'm coming with you.

29:37.454 --> 29:40.477
Agent Keaton. I'm Anthony Cabrera.

29:40.825 --> 29:43.349
- This is Agent Zain.
- Pleasure.

29:43.373 --> 29:46.289
I worked with Laine. I'm sorry.

29:47.986 --> 29:49.375
We're in here.

30:00.216 --> 30:02.542
Thank you so much for coming,
Agent Keaton.

30:02.566 --> 30:05.154
I know our two agencies haven't
always worked well together

30:05.178 --> 30:08.331
in the past, but
four of our people are dead.

30:08.355 --> 30:10.159
And we're willing to do
anything in our power

30:10.183 --> 30:11.648
to find those responsible.

30:12.663 --> 30:14.275
Tell us what you know.

30:22.195 --> 30:24.477
The separate attacks were
definitely coordinated.

30:24.501 --> 30:26.914
All three happened within
30 minutes of one another.

30:26.938 --> 30:28.612
Any indication that Tal's operatives

30:28.636 --> 30:30.048
were in communication with each other?

30:30.072 --> 30:31.745
Not at this moment, no, but we're still

30:31.769 --> 30:33.486
waiting on signals intelligence
from the NSA.

30:33.510 --> 30:35.088
How did Tal find them?

30:36.600 --> 30:38.622
Truth is, we don't know.

30:38.646 --> 30:40.102
But we have a theory.

30:40.126 --> 30:42.495
It's not uncommon for
foreign intelligence agencies

30:42.519 --> 30:44.367
to monitor our operatives
when they're abroad.

30:44.391 --> 30:46.195
Our bureau does the
same thing here in the States.

30:46.219 --> 30:47.587
Exactly.

30:47.611 --> 30:49.633
We think that Tal may have
exploited these agencies

30:49.657 --> 30:51.200
in an effort to locate our people.

30:51.562 --> 30:53.376
We think that's how he found
them and how he was able

30:53.400 --> 30:55.073
to take them out so quickly.

30:55.097 --> 30:57.162
Okay, so you've told us where
and you've told us how,

30:57.186 --> 30:59.599
but you still haven't told us
why these four operatives

30:59.623 --> 31:01.471
were targeted by Mikhail Tal.

31:01.495 --> 31:03.125
Retaliation.

31:03.149 --> 31:06.128
These four operatives were part
of a team that in 2015

31:06.152 --> 31:08.391
stopped the bombing
of 20 passenger planes

31:08.415 --> 31:09.956
that were US-bound.

31:10.547 --> 31:12.046
They saved thousands of people.

31:12.070 --> 31:13.793
And he killed them because of that?

31:14.377 --> 31:15.670
Yes.

31:18.903 --> 31:20.229
Who knew about this team?

31:20.253 --> 31:23.057
Uh, a handful of analysts,
systems technicians,

31:23.081 --> 31:24.885
and, uh, senior operations managers.

31:24.909 --> 31:26.235
We're gonna need a complete list of

31:26.259 --> 31:27.714
all those names by the end of the day.

31:27.738 --> 31:29.238
Cabrera can help you with that.

31:38.749 --> 31:40.111
Agent Keaton.

31:42.710 --> 31:44.699
I am sorry for your loss.

31:55.549 --> 31:58.354
Only a handful of people
at the CIA knew the identities

31:58.378 --> 32:01.400
of the four operatives killed
at the recent attacks.

32:01.424 --> 32:04.186
Tal had to have gotten
the names from one of them.

32:04.210 --> 32:05.970
These are the 12 people.

32:06.342 --> 32:08.277
These are our suspects.

32:08.301 --> 32:09.365
Let's go to work.

32:42.509 --> 32:44.050
Keaton?

32:46.339 --> 32:47.398
What, you got something?

32:47.422 --> 32:48.795
Robert Lennon checks out.

32:48.819 --> 32:50.928
From the beginning,
he's been claiming that

32:50.952 --> 32:52.973
he had no knowledge of
Brian Lanich's whereabouts

32:52.997 --> 32:54.497
the day of the attack.

32:54.521 --> 32:57.630
I just got confirmation that
he was telling the truth.

32:57.654 --> 32:59.415
He couldn't have done it.

32:59.439 --> 33:00.608
That's her.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.753
Erica Shepherd.

33:02.778 --> 33:04.987
She's the one that's working with Tal.

33:07.185 --> 33:08.989
Whoa, wait.

33:09.013 --> 33:11.253
Look, we don't have it yet.
We don't have enough evidence.

33:11.277 --> 33:13.037
You confront her now,
you risk her conviction.

33:13.061 --> 33:14.865
We'll get it, Will.
We have to do this by the book.

33:14.889 --> 33:17.215
- I will.
- Where are you going?

33:19.676 --> 33:21.421
Just wanna talk to her.

33:42.133 --> 33:44.373
Thomas.

33:44.397 --> 33:46.399
Nia.

33:47.704 --> 33:48.812
It's good to see you guys.

33:48.836 --> 33:49.856
You, too, Will.

33:49.880 --> 33:51.336
We miss you.

33:51.360 --> 33:53.033
You don't come by the house anymore.

33:53.057 --> 33:55.035
I know. I'm sorry.
I've been a little busy.

33:55.059 --> 33:56.994
You can still visit, you know.

33:57.018 --> 33:58.583
That hasn't changed.

33:59.352 --> 34:00.960
Appreciate that.

34:01.675 --> 34:03.796
Saved these seats for you guys.

34:04.286 --> 34:06.716
You know how this is gonna work?

34:07.507 --> 34:09.702
Yeah, well the, uh,
director's gonna get up

34:09.726 --> 34:11.400
and he's gonna say a few words.

34:11.424 --> 34:15.683
And then he's gonna put Laine's
name in the Book of Honor.

34:16.167 --> 34:17.884
Her star's already on the wall.

34:22.217 --> 34:24.525
I gave the CIA my daughter.

34:25.525 --> 34:27.320
They give me a star.

34:35.056 --> 34:37.830
Can you, uh, excuse me
for a minute, please?

34:41.018 --> 34:42.293
Erica Shepherd.

34:43.760 --> 34:45.563
Agent Keaton. How have you been?

34:45.588 --> 34:47.005
I've been better.

34:48.938 --> 34:50.525
So I was wondering, um,

34:50.550 --> 34:53.092
how's the progress
on the Tal investigation?

34:53.117 --> 34:54.485
Any closer to catching him?

34:54.510 --> 34:56.599
I'm sorry, I can't say.

34:57.339 --> 35:00.274
Are you still heading up
the investigation for the FBI?

35:00.298 --> 35:01.687
I am.

35:02.518 --> 35:04.235
Sorry, can't say.

35:04.259 --> 35:07.238
Though there has been some talk.

35:07.262 --> 35:09.980
Nothing official, just
gossip among family members.

35:10.004 --> 35:11.547
What kind of gossip?

35:11.571 --> 35:13.244
A little bit of everything.

35:13.268 --> 35:15.942
Some people think that he
was working with the Russians.

35:15.966 --> 35:18.329
Others think that he was
working with an American.

35:19.230 --> 35:20.947
In fact, some think from the CIA.

35:20.971 --> 35:23.626
Hmm. And what do you think?

35:24.888 --> 35:27.588
I think that whoever it is
should be worried.

35:28.892 --> 35:30.675
'Cause sooner or later,
I'm gonna find them.

35:32.552 --> 35:34.310
I'm confident that you will.

36:05.015 --> 36:06.627
It's time to go to bed.

36:07.975 --> 36:09.171
What?

36:09.933 --> 36:11.607
I have to be at work early in the morning

36:11.631 --> 36:13.435
and I'm not gonna be rushed
like I was today.

36:13.459 --> 36:16.053
- It is time to go to bed.
- Okay.

36:17.430 --> 36:18.875
Did you do your homework?

36:18.899 --> 36:20.485
I forgot. I'll do it in the morning.

36:20.509 --> 36:21.660
I'll wake up early. I promise.

36:21.684 --> 36:23.662
Hannah, you are 13 years old.

36:23.686 --> 36:25.534
Can you explain to me
why I'm telling you to

36:25.558 --> 36:27.013
go to bed at night, asking you if you've

36:27.037 --> 36:28.493
brushed your teeth, and I'm dragging you

36:28.517 --> 36:29.973
out of bed every morning?

36:29.997 --> 36:32.497
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry isn't an answer!

36:32.521 --> 36:35.406
And sorry is not gonna cut it
in the real world!

36:35.872 --> 36:39.156
You have got to start
taking care of yourself!

36:45.578 --> 36:48.842
I'm sorry. I'm exhausted.

36:51.627 --> 36:54.634
You have got to start
taking care of yourself.

36:55.544 --> 36:58.001
I'm not always gonna be here
to take care of you.

36:58.025 --> 37:00.070
Do your homework.

37:03.639 --> 37:05.748
I'm sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me.

37:13.954 --> 37:16.019
- You were right.
- About what?

37:16.043 --> 37:17.194
Erica Shepherd.

37:17.218 --> 37:18.456
You were right.

37:18.480 --> 37:19.849
We got the subpoenas?

37:19.873 --> 37:21.459
Yeah, the phone company
turned over the records

37:21.483 --> 37:22.765
of her family's phones this morning.

37:22.789 --> 37:24.244
She was using her husband's cell.

37:24.268 --> 37:26.072
No, her daughter's.

37:26.096 --> 37:29.162
There's one incoming call
from a known Tal associate

37:29.186 --> 37:30.903
on the morning of the attacks.

37:30.927 --> 37:34.715
Will, it is less than an hour
before the first death.

37:35.802 --> 37:39.259
We got her. Where is she now?

38:12.621 --> 38:14.599
Hey, Hannah. Where are you?

38:14.623 --> 38:15.992
Okay, well, I'm almost there.

38:16.016 --> 38:18.081
I'll meet you outside
the museum entrance.

38:18.105 --> 38:20.534
Okay, bye.

39:55.115 --> 39:57.746
All agents move in. Move in now!

39:57.770 --> 39:59.356
- Go, go, go!
- FBI!

39:59.380 --> 40:01.793
- Don't move!
- Do not move!

40:01.817 --> 40:03.360
- Left side.
- Covered.

40:03.384 --> 40:05.492
Hands behind your head.

40:05.516 --> 40:08.539
- Do it now!
- Hands behind your head!

40:16.005 --> 40:18.268
Stand up.

40:22.533 --> 40:24.051
Erica Shepherd,

40:24.579 --> 40:26.035
you're under arrest for espionage

40:26.059 --> 40:28.559
and conspiracy against
the United States of America.

40:28.583 --> 40:31.183
I know what you did. I know everything.

40:31.760 --> 40:33.216
Life is over.

40:35.242 --> 40:37.089
- Get her away from me.
- Wait.

40:37.113 --> 40:39.613
My daughter's on her way here.
Let me say good-bye to her.

40:39.637 --> 40:42.442
No. Get her out of here.

40:42.466 --> 40:43.737
Please.

40:47.080 --> 40:49.159
Please, please!

40:50.213 --> 40:51.713
Hannah!

41:06.839 --> 41:08.294
Don't say your name.

41:08.318 --> 41:10.427
Don't say who you're calling for.

41:10.451 --> 41:11.733
Just give me the first

41:11.757 --> 41:12.995
three-digit code you were sent.

41:13.019 --> 41:15.477
BQR.

41:16.805 --> 41:20.567
- The second three-digit code.
- 7RK.

41:20.591 --> 41:23.048
One moment.

41:24.334 --> 41:26.447
Hello?

41:31.689 --> 41:33.162
Hello?

41:34.518 --> 41:36.061
Hello, Erica.

41:36.085 --> 41:37.715
Tal?

41:37.739 --> 41:39.804
I must admit that I didn't think I would

41:39.828 --> 41:41.806
hear your voice again.

41:41.830 --> 41:43.765
What is it you want from me?

41:43.789 --> 41:46.855
Three years ago you made me an offer.

41:46.879 --> 41:48.260
What of it?

41:49.142 --> 41:51.680
I want to know if it still stands.

41:52.556 --> 41:54.950
Three years ago, you were
in a position to help me.

41:54.974 --> 41:58.301
I still am. The FBI, William Keaton.

41:58.325 --> 42:00.303
He's closing in on you.
I know you feel it.

42:00.327 --> 42:01.695
I can help you.

42:04.461 --> 42:05.819
Why?

42:06.289 --> 42:09.007
After all these years,

42:09.573 --> 42:12.078
why would you do this now?

42:14.080 --> 42:19.389
I am not going to die in a cage.
