Doctor Beverly Crusher,
Personal Log, Stardate 44821.3.

00:07.566 --> 00:10.558
Began an analysis today
of the respiratory problems

00:10.602 --> 00:13.628
being experienced
on the Beta Moon of Peliar Zel.

00:13.672 --> 00:16.470
Finally got
an actual letter from Wesley.

00:16.508 --> 00:18.533
Topped the class in Exobiology

00:18.577 --> 00:20.807
but he's still struggling
in Ancient Philosophies.

00:20.846 --> 00:23.747
And... there's someone new
in my life.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:33.558 --> 00:35.685
Ambassador Odan, Dr. Crusher.

00:35.727 --> 00:38.423
I was just on my way
to speak to you.

00:38.463 --> 00:39.430
Hello, Data.

00:39.464 --> 00:40.931
I've completed my study

00:40.966 --> 00:43.526
on the atmospheric variations
which have occurred on the moons

00:43.568 --> 00:45.195
since the new technology
was implemented.

00:45.304 --> 00:47.363
Oh, thank you, Commander.
That will be most helpful

00:47.406 --> 00:48.930
in my efforts
to mediate the quarrel.

00:48.974 --> 00:50.464
I could go over it with you now.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.409
It would not require
more than two hours.

00:52.444 --> 00:54.878
Oh, we-we do appreciate
that, Data

00:54.913 --> 00:58.508
but the Ambassador and I
have set aside this time

00:58.550 --> 01:01.747
to analyze the incidence
of the lung disease

01:01.787 --> 01:03.652
on the moons' inhabitants.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.657
Then it is perfect timing,
Doctor.

01:05.691 --> 01:06.885
What better occasion

01:06.925 --> 01:09.325
to integrate my results
into your study?

01:12.264 --> 01:14.164
Now that I think about it

01:14.199 --> 01:16.497
you're absolutely right,
Commander.

01:16.535 --> 01:19.003
Unfortunately,
I'm not feeling very well.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.665
Perhaps Dr. Crusher
could get you started

01:21.707 --> 01:23.675
inputting your information.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.802
l, myself, must return
to my quarters.

01:25.844 --> 01:28.608
Ambassador, are you still having
those awful headaches?

01:28.647 --> 01:31.480
I'd better bring you a hypospray
to take care of it.

01:31.516 --> 01:33.177
I would be most grateful.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.378
Okay.

01:37.122 --> 01:40.353
Put a cold cloth on your
forehead, Ambassador.

01:40.392 --> 01:42.019
I'll do my best
to be with you shortly.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.961
I'll set you up with
the medical monitor, Data.

01:44.996 --> 01:47.396
It'll take you a while to input
the figures, won't it?

01:47.432 --> 01:48.660
At least an hour.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.668
But I do not believe
much time can be saved

01:50.702 --> 01:52.397
by exhibiting such haste now,
Doctor.

01:52.437 --> 01:56.533
Data, there are times
when every second does count.

03:01.373 --> 03:05.776
Space, the final frontier.

03:05.811 --> 03:09.645
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise. 

03:09.681 --> 03:11.649
Its continuing mission...

03:11.683 --> 03:15.619
to explore strange new worlds

03:15.654 --> 03:20.091
to seek out new life
and new civilizations

03:20.125 --> 03:24.619
to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

04:39.538 --> 04:41.836
Somehow, I had an unnatural fear

04:41.873 --> 04:45.673
that Data was going to barge in
and ask to discuss

04:45.710 --> 04:49.942
the peripheral effects
of magnetospheric energy taps.

04:49.981 --> 04:51.107
Well, if I don't get back soon

04:51.149 --> 04:52.480
and take a look
at his projections

04:52.517 --> 04:54.849
he just might come
looking for me.

04:56.087 --> 05:01.286
Do you know when I first met
the formidable Doctor Beverly...

05:01.326 --> 05:03.419
what, uh, 10 days ago? ...

05:03.461 --> 05:08.592
I thought to myself,
"This woman is ice...

05:08.633 --> 05:12.592
through to her bones."

05:12.637 --> 05:15.697
Who would have ever guessed
that instead of ice

05:15.740 --> 05:18.937
there is fire?

05:23.481 --> 05:25.449
Odan...

05:25.483 --> 05:27.110
Stay here.

05:27.152 --> 05:29.677
Don't go.

05:29.721 --> 05:32.622
Odan, are we...?

05:32.657 --> 05:34.352
Is this interfering

05:34.392 --> 05:37.987
with your work
on the Peliar Zel problems?

05:38.029 --> 05:41.294
Well, fortunately, I've done
about as much as I can

05:41.333 --> 05:44.166
until we get there,
because I just can't seem

05:44.269 --> 05:46.601
to keep my mind
on my work right now.

05:49.174 --> 05:50.163
Odan...

05:50.208 --> 05:51.175
Mm-hmm.

05:51.209 --> 05:52.176
I have to go.

05:52.210 --> 05:53.177
No!

05:53.211 --> 05:56.305
Promise me
we'll be together tonight.

05:56.348 --> 05:57.940
I promise.

06:01.620 --> 06:04.248
Then you may go, Doctor Beverly.

06:04.289 --> 06:06.086
It's just Beverly.

06:06.124 --> 06:07.614
Not just Beverly.

06:07.659 --> 06:12.119
It's Beverly's smile,
it's her kindness

06:12.163 --> 06:14.131
her beauty,
within and without.

06:14.199 --> 06:16.929
So much more
than just Beverly.

06:16.968 --> 06:18.902
Picard to Ambassador Odan.

06:18.937 --> 06:20.063
Yes, Captain, this is Odan.

06:20.105 --> 06:22.005
The Federation representative
from Peliar Zel

06:22.040 --> 06:23.337
has come on board.

06:23.375 --> 06:25.536
Would you care to meet us
in the observation lounge?

06:25.577 --> 06:27.169
I'll be right there, Captain.

06:34.586 --> 06:37.555
If the news were encouraging,
I assume you would not be here.

06:37.589 --> 06:39.489
I am afraid you are correct,
Captain.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.958
The situation is growing
progressively worse.

06:41.993 --> 06:44.291
Where have you been?

06:44.329 --> 06:46.388
Uh, with a patient.

06:46.431 --> 06:47.989
Minor emergency.

06:50.001 --> 06:51.434
Ambassador Odan.

06:54.372 --> 06:57.307
This is Governor Leka Trion,
of Peliar Zel.

06:57.342 --> 07:00.311
Ambassador,
thank you for coming.

07:00.345 --> 07:01.642
I knew your father.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.875
His efforts helped keep
our people at peace

07:03.915 --> 07:05.314
for several generations.

07:05.350 --> 07:08.217
I would hope to serve you
as well as he.

07:08.253 --> 07:11.120
Governor, Ambassador.

07:14.993 --> 07:15.982
I hope Doctor Crusher

07:16.027 --> 07:17.927
was able to help you
with your headache.

07:17.962 --> 07:20.123
Thank you.
Actually, she was.

07:20.165 --> 07:21.655
Governor Leka
has intercepted us

07:21.700 --> 07:22.962
before we reach her planet

07:23.001 --> 07:24.901
in order to update us
on the situation.

07:24.936 --> 07:27.404
The people on our moons
have been in discord

07:27.439 --> 07:29.669
ever since they migrated
from our planet

07:29.708 --> 07:30.800
five centuries ago.

07:30.842 --> 07:32.070
To us on the planet

07:32.110 --> 07:33.839
they're like
two squabbling children.

07:33.878 --> 07:36.506
We try to help them
settle their arguments

07:36.548 --> 07:39.984
by not taking sides,
but this time, we are at a loss.

07:40.018 --> 07:42.509
Well, I've been studying
the information you sent.

07:42.554 --> 07:45.148
If I understand correctly,
the people of Alpha Moon

07:45.190 --> 07:47.658
have found a way to tap directly
into the magnetic field

07:47.692 --> 07:48.954
of your planet

07:48.993 --> 07:52.053
and now rely exclusively
on that energy source.

07:52.097 --> 07:54.292
Yes, but the Beta Moon
is now suffering

07:54.332 --> 07:56.493
some environmental damage
as a result.

07:56.534 --> 07:58.161
My design model suggests

07:58.269 --> 08:00.931
that Beta
will eventually experience

08:00.972 --> 08:04.237
rising temperatures,
erratic tide surges

08:04.275 --> 08:07.608
and, in general,
the beginning of global warming.

08:07.645 --> 08:10.637
The impact on the health
of the Betan people is clear.

08:10.682 --> 08:13.207
There will be
profound medical repercussions.

08:13.251 --> 08:17.381
Alpha is unwilling to give up
its newfound energy source.

08:17.422 --> 08:18.787
Beta accuses them

08:18.823 --> 08:21.348
of intentionally
courting genocide.

08:21.392 --> 08:24.452
Our efforts to reach
a compromise have failed.

08:24.496 --> 08:27.329
And now we have received
intelligence

08:27.365 --> 08:30.095
that both sides
are arming for war.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.602
If that happens,
the people on my planet

08:32.636 --> 08:34.001
will begin to take sides

08:34.038 --> 08:36.232
and the outcome
can only be disastrous.

08:36.274 --> 08:38.741
We'll be in orbit around
Peliar Zel within six hours.

08:38.777 --> 08:40.142
If you could arrange

08:40.211 --> 08:42.577
for the representatives
of Alpha and Beta to be there

08:42.614 --> 08:44.013
then Ambassador Odan could beam

08:44.048 --> 08:45.743
directly down
to the planet's surface.

08:45.784 --> 08:46.773
Excuse me, Captain.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.683
I prefer to shuttle
to the surface.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.449
I would not recommend it.

08:50.488 --> 08:54.151
There are many radical factions
involved in this dispute.

08:54.259 --> 08:56.784
It would be difficult
to guarantee your safety.

08:56.828 --> 08:59.797
Well, I'm sure I'm not the first
who has expressed discomfort

08:59.831 --> 09:01.526
at the idea
of molecular transport.

09:01.566 --> 09:03.591
Thank you,
but I prefer to remain intact.

09:03.635 --> 09:04.897
I'll shuttle down.

09:04.936 --> 09:06.233
As you wish.

09:15.446 --> 09:17.209
Counselor, what is it?

09:18.683 --> 09:20.480
It's Ambassador Odan.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.349
I continually feel...

09:22.387 --> 09:25.220
fluctuations
of emotion from him.

09:25.256 --> 09:27.724
Perhaps it's perfectly
normal among the Trill.

09:27.759 --> 09:28.726
It could be.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.786
We know so very little
about them.

09:31.830 --> 09:34.663
Yes... quite.

09:42.140 --> 09:43.129
Hi, Deanna.

09:43.174 --> 09:44.163
Hi.

09:55.453 --> 10:00.083
Is that the colgonite astringent
you have on your eyes?

10:02.961 --> 10:05.896
Yes. I guess so.

10:05.930 --> 10:07.864
I've never tried it.

10:07.899 --> 10:12.768
Someone...
just put it on... me.

10:14.606 --> 10:16.767
I didn't know
you even came in here.

10:16.808 --> 10:18.298
I don't.

10:18.343 --> 10:22.177
At least, um...
at least not very often.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.808
But it feels good
to indulge yourself sometimes.

10:25.850 --> 10:26.908
I guess so.

10:26.951 --> 10:29.545
Especially when you
haven't done so in a while.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.351
Wha-What is that
supposed to mean?

10:34.425 --> 10:35.653
Beverly...

10:35.693 --> 10:37.957
you're in love.

10:41.165 --> 10:44.532
Sometimes I wish
you weren't so empathic.

10:46.537 --> 10:49.734
I don't think
it's really a secret.

10:49.774 --> 10:52.334
It isn't?

10:52.377 --> 10:54.743
You've been glowing.

10:55.914 --> 10:57.575
Oh.

10:59.150 --> 11:01.812
Must be the astringent.

11:05.323 --> 11:06.585
What?

11:07.592 --> 11:09.423
Nothing.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.518
Oh, yes, there is.

11:10.561 --> 11:11.619
What is it?

11:14.532 --> 11:17.160
It's just something
I sense in Odan.

11:17.235 --> 11:19.169
What?
What do you sense?

11:19.203 --> 11:20.693
It's just...

11:22.874 --> 11:24.808
How well do you really know him?

11:24.842 --> 11:26.673
I feel I know him better

11:26.711 --> 11:29.339
than I've known anyone
in my life.

11:31.549 --> 11:32.914
Am I being foolish?

11:32.951 --> 11:34.612
I don't think so.

11:34.652 --> 11:38.486
And yet, I've only known him
for a couple of weeks.

11:38.523 --> 11:41.686
Of course,
that could be infatuation.

11:41.726 --> 11:44.354
But I am a grownup
and I know the difference

11:44.395 --> 11:46.363
between love and infatuation.

11:48.199 --> 11:51.327
Oh, all I know is...

11:51.369 --> 11:55.465
I haven't felt this way
for a long time.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.406
And you like it.

11:57.442 --> 11:59.967
I like it.

12:10.304 --> 12:11.328
Come.

12:11.372 --> 12:13.431
You wanted to see me, Captain?

12:13.474 --> 12:15.669
Yes, Ambassador.
Please sit down.

12:15.709 --> 12:17.233
We have entered orbit.

12:17.278 --> 12:20.111
We shall be transporting
you to the planet

12:20.147 --> 12:21.444
in a few minutes.

12:21.482 --> 12:23.245
Oh, I am ready, Captain.

12:23.284 --> 12:26.685
How will you proceed
when you're there?

12:26.720 --> 12:28.153
Oh, I cannot answer that.

12:28.222 --> 12:31.157
I... I never know
until I'm into the situation...

12:31.225 --> 12:32.556
meet the people involved.

12:32.593 --> 12:35.756
I work very much by instinct,
and not by prearranged plan.

12:35.796 --> 12:39.527
Well, it seems
to work well for you.

12:39.567 --> 12:41.728
Well, I do like to go
into a situation

12:41.769 --> 12:43.327
as well-informed as possible

12:43.370 --> 12:46.430
and I must say that your staff
has been quite helpful

12:46.473 --> 12:48.998
in briefing me
on the problems down there...

12:51.045 --> 12:53.138
particularly Doctor Crusher.

12:53.180 --> 12:54.613
My staff is quite capable.

12:54.648 --> 12:56.172
I'm glad they've been useful.

12:56.250 --> 12:59.583
Your Doctor Beverly is...

12:59.620 --> 13:02.919
an extraordinary person

13:02.957 --> 13:06.222
both as a scientist and...

13:06.260 --> 13:08.524
and as a woman.

13:10.531 --> 13:12.123
Yes, I'm sure that's true.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.532
Well, shall we make our way
to the Shuttle Bay?

13:14.568 --> 13:18.902
Captain, you know her
better than I.

13:18.939 --> 13:20.531
Do you have any idea

13:20.574 --> 13:24.533
how committed she is
to remaining with Starfleet?

13:24.578 --> 13:26.978
I wouldn't presume
to speak for her.

13:27.014 --> 13:28.777
Oh, no, of course not.

13:28.816 --> 13:29.976
I just thought...

13:30.017 --> 13:33.384
Well, you've known her
so much longer than I.

13:33.420 --> 13:35.115
Ensign Taggert
to Captain Picard.

13:35.155 --> 13:36.554
Yes, Ensign?

13:36.590 --> 13:38.581
The shuttle is ready
to transport the Ambassador.

13:38.626 --> 13:41.060
Very well.

13:41.095 --> 13:44.292
I'll find my own way, Captain.

13:44.331 --> 13:47.266
I hope to return with good news.

13:55.342 --> 13:56.639
Commander Riker has asked

13:56.677 --> 13:58.372
to pilot you himself,
Ambassador.

13:58.412 --> 14:00.175
I am honored.

14:00.281 --> 14:01.748
I don't know when I'll be back.

14:01.782 --> 14:04.046
I know.
Have a safe trip.

14:04.084 --> 14:05.813
Oh, I will stay safe,
Doctor Beverly.

14:05.853 --> 14:07.650
I have good reason to return.

14:07.688 --> 14:10.122
I've researched Earth customs.

14:10.157 --> 14:13.251
This flower is given
to express love.

14:13.294 --> 14:15.125
Yes, it is.

14:27.308 --> 14:30.106
Initiate shuttle
preflight sequence.

14:30.144 --> 14:32.408
Preflight underway,
counting to clearance.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.943
Shuttle has cleared
the bay door.

14:35.983 --> 14:37.143
Commander Riker

14:37.251 --> 14:40.243
you will be out of shield range
in five seconds.

14:40.287 --> 14:41.345
Acknowledged, Lieutenant.

14:41.388 --> 14:42.946
We'll be entering
the upper ionosphere

14:42.990 --> 14:44.321
in two minutes and 20 seconds.

14:44.358 --> 14:46.588
Sir, an unidentified ship

14:46.627 --> 14:49.960
is emerging from the limb
of the moon.

14:49.997 --> 14:51.123
Hail the vessel.

14:51.165 --> 14:52.928
I have visual contact.

14:52.967 --> 14:54.832
I don't recognize it.

14:54.868 --> 14:58.895
It claims to be an escort vessel
from the Beta Moon.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.305
There was no mention
of an escort.

15:01.342 --> 15:04.402
Request a security
clearance code.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.743
They do not answer, sir.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.917
Commander Riker, prepare
to return to the Shuttle Bay.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.248
Acknowledged.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.720
Captain, they are loading
their phaser banks.

15:14.755 --> 15:16.416
Increasing power to the shields.

15:21.128 --> 15:22.254
Coming about.

15:25.699 --> 15:27.428
Engage tractor beam.
Report, Number One.

15:27.468 --> 15:30.767
We've lost port thrusters
and both backup stabilizers.

15:30.804 --> 15:31.862
I'm losing control.

15:31.905 --> 15:33.668
We're bringing you in.

15:39.046 --> 15:40.946
Captain, the shuttle hull
has been weakened.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.710
We're breaking up.
You can't tow us.

15:42.750 --> 15:44.809
You better beam us
directly on board.

15:44.852 --> 15:45.819
No.
Don't do it.

15:45.853 --> 15:47.150
I can't stabilize the shuttle.

15:47.221 --> 15:49.280
If you transport me,
it will kill me.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.881
Please...

15:50.924 --> 15:54.087
Number One, we're ready
to beam you aboard.

15:54.128 --> 15:56.494
Belay that order, Captain.
I'll bring her in manually.

15:56.530 --> 15:59.761
Advise Doctor Crusher
we have a medical emergency.

16:04.405 --> 16:05.929
He's in shock.

16:05.973 --> 16:07.440
He's lost a lot of blood

16:07.474 --> 16:10.341
but that still doesn't explain
these readings.

16:18.052 --> 16:20.748
Sedimentation rate is 29

16:20.788 --> 16:22.915
but his lymphocytes
are still intact.

16:22.956 --> 16:25.754
It's as though
there's a parasite at work.

16:25.793 --> 16:27.522
Odan?

16:27.561 --> 16:29.290
Odan...

16:31.098 --> 16:33.396
I need to do
exploratory surgery.

16:33.434 --> 16:35.959
You may have
a parasitic infection.

16:37.471 --> 16:39.098
You must not.

16:39.139 --> 16:41.630
You won't survive.

16:46.647 --> 16:49.241
What is that?

16:49.283 --> 16:51.080
Beverly...

16:51.118 --> 16:54.281
that is me.

16:54.321 --> 16:56.084
What?

16:56.123 --> 16:58.990
This body is just a host.

17:00.527 --> 17:03.087
I am that parasite.

17:04.897 --> 17:07.731
That is what must survive.

17:14.741 --> 17:18.040
It has always been this way.

17:19.980 --> 17:23.211
The Trill
are a joined species...

17:24.685 --> 17:27.381
a host and a symbiont...

17:29.623 --> 17:33.650
and in this fashion,
we have survived for millennia.

17:33.694 --> 17:35.662
You're dying.

17:35.696 --> 17:37.561
What can I do?

17:39.399 --> 17:43.961
The host body is dying.

17:44.004 --> 17:46.268
You must contact the Trill
quickly.

17:46.306 --> 17:48.570
Tell them I need another host.

17:48.609 --> 17:51.043
They will send a replacement.

17:53.313 --> 17:57.750
I know this is
difficult to accept

17:57.784 --> 18:01.982
but I beg you, Doctor Beverly...

18:02.022 --> 18:04.957
help me.

18:04.992 --> 18:07.483
This mission must be completed.

18:09.963 --> 18:13.057
Odan's host body
died of the injuries

18:13.100 --> 18:14.863
just over an hour ago

18:14.902 --> 18:18.736
but the symbiont being,
Odan, is still alive.

18:18.772 --> 18:21.570
Odan is the one
who negotiated the last treaty.

18:21.608 --> 18:24.099
But the man everyone
thought was his father

18:24.178 --> 18:25.770
was just another host body.

18:25.812 --> 18:28.303
And the reason Odan
refused the transporter?

18:28.348 --> 18:31.317
It would have damaged
the symbiont.

18:31.351 --> 18:32.511
We've contacted the Trill.

18:32.553 --> 18:34.316
Another host
will be here in 40 hours.

18:34.354 --> 18:35.844
I've placed Odan in stasis.

18:35.889 --> 18:38.517
He can survive
another hour, maybe two

18:38.559 --> 18:40.322
but not beyond that.

18:40.360 --> 18:43.488
Would it be possible for me
to serve as a temporary carrier?

18:43.530 --> 18:44.588
No, Data.

18:44.631 --> 18:47.828
The relationship requires
a biological being.

18:47.868 --> 18:50.837
We're at a desperate impasse
in the Peliar system.

18:50.871 --> 18:53.772
The attack on the shuttlecraft
has inflamed the dispute.

18:53.807 --> 18:54.774
Who was responsible?

18:54.808 --> 18:56.139
No one will admit anything.

18:56.210 --> 18:59.304
Each side accuses the other,
and the threats are mounting.

18:59.346 --> 19:00.870
We need Odan.

19:00.914 --> 19:04.077
Doctor, could a human host
carry him?

19:04.117 --> 19:05.414
I believe so.

19:05.452 --> 19:07.750
From Odan's description
of the process

19:07.788 --> 19:09.415
it should be possible,
but I don't have...

19:09.456 --> 19:10.718
Then I volunteer.

19:10.757 --> 19:13.726
There's been no precedent
for a human host.

19:13.760 --> 19:16.058
I couldn't guarantee
what might happen.

19:16.096 --> 19:18.462
The risk is too great,
Commander.

19:18.498 --> 19:20.864
Weigh it against the prospect
of war.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.504
It's your choice, Will.

19:24.538 --> 19:27.098
Let's get to it.

19:35.349 --> 19:37.977
I've given you
a local anesthetic.

19:38.018 --> 19:41.112
You must be conscious
during the implantation.

19:41.188 --> 19:43.486
Drugs might damage
the symbiont.

19:43.523 --> 19:44.649
I understand.

19:44.691 --> 19:46.158
Laser scalpel.

20:32.706 --> 20:34.298
How do you feel?

20:34.341 --> 20:36.036
Is there any pain?

20:36.076 --> 20:39.375
No, just
some strange sensations.

20:39.413 --> 20:40.380
Vital signs?

20:40.414 --> 20:41.574
Heart rate 110.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.708
Blood pressure 90 over 40.

20:43.750 --> 20:44.842
I can't close yet.

20:44.885 --> 20:46.614
The assimilation's not complete.

20:46.653 --> 20:48.951
Pulse 130 and climbing.

20:48.989 --> 20:50.115
EEG is erratic.

20:50.157 --> 20:51.556
He's going to start
fibrillating.

20:51.591 --> 20:52.819
200 milligrams of metrazene.

20:52.859 --> 20:54.554
Yes, Doctor.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.460
Hang on, Will.

20:57.497 --> 20:59.192
We've got incorporation, Doctor.

20:59.266 --> 21:01.734
I'm closing.

21:05.238 --> 21:08.469
Brain waves are still irregular.

21:08.508 --> 21:10.999
The metrazene should
have stabilized him.

21:11.044 --> 21:13.569
I'll give it ten more seconds
before I go in again.

21:13.613 --> 21:17.014
Here we go.
EEG approaching regular.

21:17.050 --> 21:19.678
Blood pressure leveling off.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.017
That's better.

21:21.054 --> 21:23.716
Signs are returning to normal.

21:26.226 --> 21:28.160
Will...

21:28.195 --> 21:29.685
it's Beverly.

21:29.730 --> 21:31.721
Can you hear me?

21:32.733 --> 21:34.325
Hello.

21:34.368 --> 21:37.030
You're going to be all right.

21:37.070 --> 21:38.560
How do you feel?

21:39.573 --> 21:41.302
I'm fine.

21:42.943 --> 21:45.912
You look a little tired,
Doctor Beverly.

21:56.942 --> 21:59.376
I know this must be disturbing,
Governor

21:59.412 --> 22:02.506
but you must convince
the inhabitants of the moons

22:02.548 --> 22:04.072
that I am Odan.

22:04.116 --> 22:08.075
I have his skills,
his thoughts, his memories.

22:08.154 --> 22:12.488
They will perceive you
as a Starfleet officer...

22:12.525 --> 22:14.891
perhaps with your own agenda.

22:14.927 --> 22:17.623
The man they knew
as my father...

22:17.663 --> 22:20.461
the man who stands
before them...

22:20.499 --> 22:22.990
both are merely hosts.

22:24.904 --> 22:27.338
It is your task
to help them understand.

22:27.373 --> 22:28.772
I will try.

22:28.808 --> 22:31.777
I cannot promise
they will listen.

22:31.811 --> 22:34.575
They are more factionalized
than ever.

22:34.613 --> 22:37.878
And listening is a skill
which seems to have evaporated

22:37.917 --> 22:39.851
with the heat of argument.

22:39.885 --> 22:41.978
Speak softly, Governor.

22:42.021 --> 22:45.115
Those who cannot
hear an angry shout

22:45.191 --> 22:47.819
may strain to hear a whisper.

22:47.860 --> 22:51.125
I will do what I can.

22:53.632 --> 22:55.293
Well done.

22:57.636 --> 23:00.434
Mr. Worf, will you escort
the Ambassador to his quarters?

23:00.473 --> 23:02.270
I'm just a little dizzy.

23:02.308 --> 23:04.435
I'll be fine.
I just need to lie down.

23:04.477 --> 23:05.774
Picard to Doctor Crusher.

23:05.811 --> 23:07.278
Yes, Captain?

23:07.313 --> 23:09.076
Doctor,
the Ambassador is not well.

23:09.148 --> 23:11.378
Will you please attend to him
in his quarters?

23:11.417 --> 23:13.044
Right away, sir.

23:13.085 --> 23:15.280
White cell count is elevated.

23:15.321 --> 23:18.620
Six-tenths of a degree
temperature.

23:18.657 --> 23:20.625
But no sign of rejection.

23:20.659 --> 23:21.785
That's good.

23:21.827 --> 23:23.795
You look awfully pale.

23:23.829 --> 23:27.629
Just a little weak
and lightheaded.

23:27.666 --> 23:30.658
Cerebral blood flow
looks normal.

23:33.506 --> 23:35.303
I'll leave
the metabolic booster.

23:35.341 --> 23:37.104
Use it if the symptoms
get worse.

23:37.176 --> 23:38.438
Beverly...

23:38.477 --> 23:40.638
Beyond that,
I don't know what to do.

23:40.679 --> 23:41.976
This is all new to me.

23:42.014 --> 23:43.311
It is new to me, as well.

23:43.349 --> 23:44.407
Please don't go.

23:44.450 --> 23:45.644
We've got to talk about this.

23:45.684 --> 23:46.912
I don't know what to say.

23:46.952 --> 23:48.112
Nor do I

23:48.153 --> 23:50.246
but I know that the
silence would injure us.

23:50.289 --> 23:52.917
Well, maybe you should have
thought about that sooner.

23:52.958 --> 23:55.722
Maybe you should have
told me what you were.

23:55.761 --> 23:58.059
It didn't seem to bother you
to remain silent yesterday.

23:58.097 --> 24:00.998
It never occurred to me.

24:01.033 --> 24:02.694
This is what I am.

24:02.735 --> 24:05.761
Did you ever tell me that you
were only a single being?

24:05.804 --> 24:06.930
Of course not.

24:06.972 --> 24:08.803
It was normal to you.

24:08.841 --> 24:11.275
I don't know who you are!

24:11.310 --> 24:12.834
You must understand.

24:12.878 --> 24:16.609
Whoever I...
whoever I seem to be, I am Odan

24:16.649 --> 24:18.617
who loved you.

24:18.651 --> 24:20.380
That has not changed.

24:20.419 --> 24:22.080
I still love you.

24:22.121 --> 24:24.089
I can't help that!

24:24.123 --> 24:27.092
If this causes you pain,
I will suppress it.

24:27.159 --> 24:29.093
I will keep my distance.

24:29.194 --> 24:31.788
Doctor Beverly...

24:31.830 --> 24:33.821
I would never hurt you.

24:51.550 --> 24:53.347
May I join you?

25:01.560 --> 25:03.050
You know, Deanna

25:03.162 --> 25:06.256
the first man I ever loved
unconditionally

25:06.298 --> 25:07.492
was named Stefan.

25:07.533 --> 25:09.865
He was a soccer player,
and I would watch him

25:09.902 --> 25:11.699
as he would race down the field.

25:11.737 --> 25:13.602
And I thought my heart
would stop

25:13.639 --> 25:17.769
because he was so beautiful.

25:17.810 --> 25:20.608
We married
and had three children...

25:20.646 --> 25:23.376
twin boys, Andrew and Alexander

25:23.415 --> 25:27.613
and then later,
a little girl, Jennifer.

25:27.653 --> 25:30.850
Stefan became an artist...
very famous.

25:30.889 --> 25:36.054
He created huge, breathtaking
metal sculptures.

25:36.095 --> 25:39.326
He came to adore me
as much as I worshipped him...

25:39.365 --> 25:41.629
in my daydreams at least.

25:41.667 --> 25:43.100
Stefan was 11, and I was eight.

25:43.168 --> 25:46.262
He never even knew I existed.

25:46.305 --> 25:48.102
Oh, Deanna...

25:48.207 --> 25:50.232
I loved Odan.

25:50.275 --> 25:51.742
I'm sure of it.

25:51.777 --> 25:54.575
I had no doubts, no fears.

25:54.613 --> 25:57.241
But what was it I loved?

25:57.282 --> 25:58.544
His eyes?

25:58.584 --> 25:59.881
His hands?

25:59.918 --> 26:01.385
His mouth?

26:01.420 --> 26:02.580
They're gone.

26:02.621 --> 26:04.384
If that was all it was

26:04.423 --> 26:07.790
I should mourn him and go on.

26:07.826 --> 26:10.852
But it was more than that.

26:10.896 --> 26:12.488
I felt...

26:12.531 --> 26:15.056
completely free with him...

26:15.134 --> 26:16.601
unguarded...

26:16.635 --> 26:19.627
at ease with myself.

26:19.672 --> 26:23.073
There were so many things
that made him special to me.

26:23.142 --> 26:24.439
And where are they?

26:24.476 --> 26:28.970
Are they still here,
alive in Will Riker?

26:30.649 --> 26:33.709
I look at Will, and I see

26:33.752 --> 26:37.620
someone I've known for years...

26:37.656 --> 26:40.489
a kind of brother.

26:42.594 --> 26:48.931
But inside, is he really Odan?

26:48.967 --> 26:51.595
Oh... help me.

26:51.637 --> 26:53.730
Please.

27:02.614 --> 27:05.583
What do your feelings tell you?

27:05.617 --> 27:07.050
I feel his pull.

27:07.119 --> 27:08.586
It's very powerful.

27:08.620 --> 27:11.919
I wish he'd never
come on this ship.

27:11.957 --> 27:13.891
Don't wish that, Beverly.

27:13.926 --> 27:18.386
You can't be open to love
if you don't risk pain.

27:18.430 --> 27:19.795
I don't care.

27:19.832 --> 27:22.801
I'd give anything
not to feel the way I do now.

27:31.443 --> 27:34.606
He's here, isn't he?

27:34.646 --> 27:36.011
Look at him.

27:36.048 --> 27:37.709
I don't want to look at him.

27:37.750 --> 27:39.809
Talk to me.
Just keep talking to me.

27:42.354 --> 27:46.552
The first man I ever
loved was my father.

27:46.592 --> 27:49.390
He was strong and tall.

27:49.428 --> 27:53.023
He carried me when
the ground was muddy.

27:53.065 --> 27:56.967
He chased away the monsters
that hid under my bed at night

27:57.002 --> 28:01.769
and he sang to me
and kept me safe.

28:03.242 --> 28:05.938
And he went away.

28:07.813 --> 28:12.147
What I wouldn't give
to hear those songs again...

28:12.184 --> 28:15.244
to feel his arms protect me.

28:15.287 --> 28:17.721
I never will.

28:17.756 --> 28:21.749
But I can still feel
his warmth and his love

28:21.794 --> 28:24.285
as though he were here with me.

28:24.329 --> 28:27.924
If you can feel those things

28:27.966 --> 28:31.902
from the man we know
as Will Riker

28:31.937 --> 28:34.804
accept them.

28:34.840 --> 28:37.308
Accept the love.

28:59.399 --> 29:02.857
Captain's Log, Stardate 44823.8.

29:02.902 --> 29:05.996
Representatives
of the two moons of Peliar Zel

29:06.072 --> 29:07.937
have agreed to come on board

29:07.974 --> 29:10.374
to meet
the "new" Ambassador Odan.

29:11.444 --> 29:13.674
White cell count is elevated.

29:13.713 --> 29:16.910
It's getting higher and higher
every time I read it.

29:16.950 --> 29:18.815
Are you in pain?

29:18.851 --> 29:20.546
Not much.

29:20.587 --> 29:22.885
Ambassador, we can stall
the representatives.

29:22.922 --> 29:24.446
They would see that
as a deception.

29:24.490 --> 29:25.855
I must meet with them.

29:25.892 --> 29:28.019
But surely, to present yourself
in this condition

29:28.094 --> 29:29.618
is not going to help our cause.

29:29.662 --> 29:30.993
I promise you, Captain

29:31.030 --> 29:32.930
they will never know
that I'm ill.

29:34.634 --> 29:37.865
Captain, the emissaries.

29:37.904 --> 29:40.839
May I present Kalin Trose,
of Alpha Moon

29:40.873 --> 29:43.034
and Lathal Bine, of Beta Moon.

29:43.076 --> 29:45.670
Thank you
for receiving us, Captain.

29:49.349 --> 29:52.477
Is this Ambassador Odan?

29:52.518 --> 29:53.951
Lathal Bine

29:53.987 --> 29:56.888
it was your aunt who represented
Beta 30 years ago.

29:56.923 --> 29:58.049
That is correct.

29:58.157 --> 30:00.022
She was a formidable woman.

30:00.059 --> 30:02.289
I had the utmost respect
for her.

30:02.328 --> 30:06.788
And who was it who spoke
for Alpha so long ago?

30:06.833 --> 30:10.325
That was you, of course...
Kalin Trose.

30:10.370 --> 30:12.668
Then you were a young man

30:12.705 --> 30:15.071
bristling with passion and zeal

30:15.108 --> 30:16.905
yet wise enough to understand

30:16.943 --> 30:20.242
that your people needed peace
to ensure their future.

30:26.185 --> 30:29.086
And how did you
achieve a compromise

30:29.188 --> 30:31.315
between that young man

30:31.357 --> 30:33.848
and the iron-willed woman
of Beta Moon?

30:33.893 --> 30:36.828
They agreed to trade places
for a week

30:36.863 --> 30:39.093
to understand
each other's situation

30:39.198 --> 30:40.995
with more informed eyes.

30:41.034 --> 30:43.764
After that,
an agreement came swiftly.

30:43.803 --> 30:47.102
Nothing that you have said
is beyond what a schoolchild

30:47.206 --> 30:49.674
could learn in a history book.

30:49.709 --> 30:51.939
What is not commonly known

30:51.978 --> 30:54.674
is that,
during those negotiations

30:54.714 --> 31:00.118
you, Kalin Trose, quelled a plot
by a radical from your own moon

31:00.186 --> 31:03.781
who was attempting to
assassinate the Beta delegate.

31:06.492 --> 31:08.426
It is true.

31:08.461 --> 31:10.793
Perhaps he was wiser
in his youth

31:10.830 --> 31:12.195
than he is now.

31:12.231 --> 31:15.064
Odan, you must
convince him to stop.

31:15.168 --> 31:16.635
Will you accept me?

31:16.669 --> 31:18.694
Will you allow me
to work with you?

31:18.738 --> 31:20.729
Yes.

31:23.209 --> 31:25.734
And Alpha Moon?

31:25.778 --> 31:27.473
I will consider it

31:27.513 --> 31:31.040
but I must consult others.

31:31.084 --> 31:33.552
This is a typical tactic.

31:33.586 --> 31:35.850
He is an obstructionist.
You can see that.

31:35.888 --> 31:38.254
Kalin Trose

31:38.291 --> 31:40.418
you may confer with your people

31:40.460 --> 31:43.088
but we must have your answer
within eight hours.

31:43.162 --> 31:46.495
You shall have it.

32:06.252 --> 32:07.651
His vital signs are overworked.

32:07.687 --> 32:09.052
His immune system
is under attack.

32:09.155 --> 32:11.350
I can only guess
that he's suffering

32:11.390 --> 32:13.381
from classic
rejection syndrome.

32:13.426 --> 32:15.394
Is there any treatment
you can give him?

32:15.428 --> 32:17.225
I can administer
an immunosuppressant.

32:17.263 --> 32:19.060
That could help relieve
the symptoms

32:19.132 --> 32:21.293
but it can't correct
the underlying cause.

32:21.334 --> 32:24.462
There is a foreign organism
in his body.

32:24.504 --> 32:26.802
Medical school didn't
exactly prepare me

32:26.839 --> 32:28.306
for situations like this.

32:28.341 --> 32:30.400
You're doing all you can.

32:32.378 --> 32:33.902
Don't worry about me, Captain.

32:33.946 --> 32:35.709
I'm fine.

32:39.552 --> 32:41.486
Ambassador,
when you feel up to it

32:41.521 --> 32:43.182
would you join me
in my ready room?

32:43.222 --> 32:45.122
Of course.

32:52.532 --> 32:56.093
I can give you something
that should help with the pain

32:56.202 --> 32:59.467
at least for a little while.

33:01.841 --> 33:03.741
The pain's gone.

33:03.776 --> 33:05.471
Thank you.

33:08.381 --> 33:09.905
Please don't.

33:09.949 --> 33:12.281
Please let me touch you...

33:12.318 --> 33:13.945
just for a moment.

33:17.657 --> 33:19.454
No... please.

33:27.300 --> 33:30.792
It was a fast decision,
which we must take as positive.

33:30.837 --> 33:33.533
The Alphan representative
has agreed...

33:33.573 --> 33:35.165
however reluctantly...

33:35.208 --> 33:37.073
to let you mediate the dispute.

33:37.109 --> 33:38.633
I knew they would.

33:38.678 --> 33:40.077
They're reasonable people.

33:40.112 --> 33:42.239
They're just trapped
in their own anger.

33:42.281 --> 33:44.977
I have no doubt, however,
that they will bolt

33:45.017 --> 33:47.747
if something goes wrong
in the discussion.

33:49.288 --> 33:51.950
Then it's my job to see
that nothing goes wrong.

33:54.227 --> 33:56.787
Did I say something wrong,
Captain Picard?

33:56.829 --> 33:59.229
No, it's just that...

33:59.265 --> 34:02.757
for a moment, you sounded
more like Will Riker.

34:08.741 --> 34:10.038
We have received information

34:10.109 --> 34:12.009
that the new host
will arrive in 18 hours.

34:12.043 --> 34:13.568
Will you be all right
until then?

34:13.612 --> 34:17.447
The medication Doctor Beverly
gave me has helped.

34:17.483 --> 34:20.475
I will find a way to keep going.

34:31.632 --> 34:33.260
Lemon tea.

34:41.076 --> 34:45.308
Computer, location
of Doctor Beverly Crusher.

34:45.347 --> 34:48.248
Doctor Crusher
is in her quarters.

35:08.636 --> 35:11.002
Can you make balso tonic?

35:11.106 --> 35:13.734
There is no formula on record.

35:13.775 --> 35:16.972
Please supply
a molecular structure.

35:17.012 --> 35:18.411
Never mind.

35:30.992 --> 35:32.619
Come in.

35:37.899 --> 35:42.165
I thought I should see
how you were doing.

35:42.203 --> 35:45.172
If you needed another hypospray.

35:45.206 --> 35:47.071
I don't think so.

35:48.476 --> 35:50.239
The symptoms haven't returned.

35:51.613 --> 35:54.446
Oh, well, that's good.

35:54.482 --> 35:56.416
Yes.

35:58.253 --> 36:00.551
Uh, tomorrow's an important day.

36:00.588 --> 36:02.715
Do you feel ready for it?

36:02.757 --> 36:03.985
I'll be fine.

36:04.092 --> 36:05.719
I've been preparing.

36:05.760 --> 36:07.125
Oh, that's good.

36:07.162 --> 36:09.096
Yes.

36:11.132 --> 36:13.999
I'll, um, check your vital signs
in the morning

36:14.035 --> 36:16.230
before the representatives
get here.

36:16.271 --> 36:20.503
I don't want them knowing
that I'm taking any medication.

36:20.542 --> 36:24.444
Maybe you could schedule
a series of breaks.

36:24.479 --> 36:25.468
That's good.

36:25.513 --> 36:27.003
Yes.

36:27.115 --> 36:28.412
Beverly, I want you.

36:28.450 --> 36:32.250
If you are going to leave,
you better go right now.

36:32.287 --> 36:34.278
I'm not leaving.

36:38.560 --> 36:42.462
Captain's Log, Stardate 44824.4.

36:42.497 --> 36:44.658
Governor Leka
and the representatives

36:44.699 --> 36:47.497
of the two moons are ready
to transport on board.

36:47.535 --> 36:50.561
We have learned that
they each have troops massed

36:50.605 --> 36:54.006
and are ready for combat,
if this final effort at peace

36:54.042 --> 36:55.168
is not successful.

36:55.210 --> 36:56.802
White count is back up.

36:56.845 --> 36:58.142
Temperature is elevated.

36:58.179 --> 37:00.306
The effects of the medication

37:00.348 --> 37:02.816
are wearing off
faster every time.

37:02.851 --> 37:04.716
I'll administer one now

37:04.752 --> 37:07.687
and hope that it will hold
for an hour or so.

37:07.722 --> 37:09.053
No. No more.

37:11.693 --> 37:15.823
Ambassador,
it's clear you're in pain.

37:15.864 --> 37:18.162
You can't get through
the next hours without help.

37:18.199 --> 37:20.463
I must.

37:20.502 --> 37:23.903
Are the injections damaging to
the host's body, Riker's body?

37:23.938 --> 37:25.405
Yes.

37:25.440 --> 37:28.238
We can't put him
through any further risk.

37:28.276 --> 37:32.212
But how can you function,
conduct the meeting?

37:32.247 --> 37:35.045
I'll manage.

37:38.153 --> 37:40.348
We'll respect your wishes.

37:40.388 --> 37:41.912
One more thing...

37:41.956 --> 37:44.584
I will conduct
the mediations today.

37:46.461 --> 37:49.555
But at the end of today,
regardless of the outcome

37:49.597 --> 37:52.225
I must be removed
from Riker's body

37:52.267 --> 37:54.462
even if the new host
has not arrived.

37:54.502 --> 37:56.129
But you won't survive.

37:56.171 --> 38:00.801
Riker will not survive
if I am not removed.

38:00.842 --> 38:02.810
He has done enough.

38:04.612 --> 38:06.307
Your word.

38:08.016 --> 38:09.677
Very well.

38:11.186 --> 38:13.654
Worf to Captain Picard.

38:13.688 --> 38:15.155
Yes, Mr. Worf?

38:15.190 --> 38:18.159
The Governor and the two
representatives have returned.

38:18.193 --> 38:21.185
I will escort them
to the observation lounge.

38:21.229 --> 38:23.424
Thank you.

38:38.413 --> 38:41.177
I'll stand by with
the medication, just in case.

38:41.216 --> 38:43.241
The pain may become
so intense that I'll have to...

38:43.284 --> 38:44.273
Beverly.

38:48.990 --> 38:53.859
Whatever else I may be to you,
I'm your friend.

38:53.895 --> 38:56.796
I can only imagine
what you're going through

38:56.831 --> 39:00.961
and I want you to know,
I'm here.

39:08.176 --> 39:10.167
Jean-Luc.

39:21.826 --> 39:23.623
Computer, what is the time?

39:23.661 --> 39:25.788
1535 hours.

39:25.830 --> 39:28.663
They've been in there
for almost six hours.

39:28.699 --> 39:31.964
Captain, I am receiving
a message from the ship

39:32.036 --> 39:33.298
carrying the Trill host.

39:33.337 --> 39:34.634
Are they here, Worf?

39:34.672 --> 39:36.469
No, they are experiencing
difficulty.

39:36.507 --> 39:38.702
They do not anticipate
their arrival

39:38.743 --> 39:40.802
for another nine hours.

39:40.845 --> 39:42.176
Nine hours?

39:46.851 --> 39:48.842
It was worth it.

39:50.554 --> 39:51.578
Ambassador.

39:56.994 --> 40:00.430
They will not go to war.

40:00.464 --> 40:02.523
Mr. Worf, see
that the representatives

40:02.566 --> 40:04.193
are safely transported
off the ship.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.999
Ensign, set a course to
intercept with the Trill vessel.

40:07.037 --> 40:08.402
Prepare to go to warp nine.

40:08.439 --> 40:11.340
Sir, it could take more than two
hours to reach the vessel.

40:11.375 --> 40:13.707
I must remove him.
I gave my word.

40:28.893 --> 40:31.020
Will is going to be all right.

40:31.095 --> 40:35.930
His vital signs have stabilized
and he's sleeping now.

40:41.005 --> 40:42.495
How is Odan?

40:42.540 --> 40:44.303
I've placed him in stasis.

40:44.341 --> 40:46.104
He's fine for the moment.

40:49.480 --> 40:53.007
You need some rest, Doctor.

40:53.050 --> 40:54.540
No. If Odan is to survive

40:54.585 --> 40:56.780
he needs to be implanted
in the new host

40:56.821 --> 40:58.448
as soon as he arrives.

40:58.489 --> 40:59.456
I'll wait here.

40:59.490 --> 41:01.014
It'll be some time.

41:01.058 --> 41:03.049
I know.

41:23.214 --> 41:25.182
Doctor.

41:25.216 --> 41:27.514
Is the Trill host here?

41:27.551 --> 41:28.848
Yes.

41:28.886 --> 41:30.183
Good.

41:30.221 --> 41:32.052
Bring him in.

41:38.529 --> 41:39.996
Doctor?

41:42.933 --> 41:44.298
I am Kareel.

41:44.335 --> 41:47.133
I am to become host to Odan.

41:54.612 --> 41:57.979
The operation to implant Odan
into the new host

41:58.015 --> 42:00.313
was completed at 1900 hours

42:00.351 --> 42:02.649
and appears
to have been successful.

42:02.686 --> 42:05.985
There were no difficulties
in assimilation.

42:06.023 --> 42:08.856
Doctor Beverly,
could we talk for a moment?

42:14.632 --> 42:15.997
You should be sleeping.

42:16.033 --> 42:17.660
You need to rest.

42:17.701 --> 42:19.498
I've never felt better...

42:19.537 --> 42:21.368
except once or twice.

42:24.108 --> 42:27.168
My poor Beverly.

42:27.211 --> 42:30.408
This has been so hard for you.

42:32.116 --> 42:35.677
I want to thank you
for your caring...

42:35.719 --> 42:38.017
for your standing by me.

42:38.088 --> 42:40.022
I congratulate you.

42:40.057 --> 42:43.424
You averted a war
that would have cost many lives.

42:43.460 --> 42:46.122
Yes.

42:46.163 --> 42:52.033
It seems as though everything
has turned out for the best.

42:55.306 --> 43:01.142
And, yes, I am still Odan,
and I still love you.

43:01.178 --> 43:05.308
I cannot imagine that
ever changing.

43:05.349 --> 43:08.512
I am glad that you're all right.

43:11.322 --> 43:13.552
Is there to be nothing more?

43:16.860 --> 43:21.695
Perhaps it is a human failing

43:21.732 --> 43:25.668
but we are not accustomed
to these kinds of changes.

43:25.703 --> 43:28.001
I can't keep up.

43:28.038 --> 43:30.336
How long will you have
this host?

43:30.374 --> 43:32.342
What would the next one be?

43:32.376 --> 43:36.574
I can't live
with that kind of uncertainty.

43:41.986 --> 43:43.214
Perhaps...

43:43.253 --> 43:45.278
someday

43:45.322 --> 43:48.917
our ability to love

43:48.959 --> 43:51.621
won't be so limited.

43:55.132 --> 43:57.657
I understand.

44:01.505 --> 44:03.837
Odan...

44:03.874 --> 44:06.536
I do love you.

44:06.577 --> 44:09.444
Please remember that.

44:17.154 --> 44:20.248
I will never forget you.
