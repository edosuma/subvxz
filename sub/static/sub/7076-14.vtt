09:19.427 --> 09:22.262
beneath the cushions of war
to the lost pennies

09:22.263 --> 09:26.917
and grody q-tips
of war's emotional toll.

09:26.918 --> 09:29.970
"Jeff, heard from one of
Troy's soldiers about a speech

09:29.971 --> 09:31.688
"you gave to troops
at the blanket fort.

09:31.689 --> 09:33.190
"Wish this war could be over.

09:33.191 --> 09:35.359
But proud of you
for taking a stance."

09:35.360 --> 09:36.543

09:36.544 --> 09:38.228
Annie Edison.

09:38.229 --> 09:39.346
"Thank you, Annie.

09:39.347 --> 09:41.181
"I'm proud of you too
and of us all.

09:41.182 --> 09:42.649
"Also with the nightmare
would end.

09:42.650 --> 09:45.035
But using what I'm given
to give what I can."

09:45.036 --> 09:46.353
Jeff Winger.

09:46.354 --> 09:48.205
"Jeff, just heard
from one of Abed's soldiers

09:48.206 --> 09:50.523
"that you gave an identical
speech to troops at Pillowtown.

09:50.524 --> 09:52.042
"WTF? Sad face.

09:52.043 --> 09:53.944
Special icon of
a downward thumb."

09:53.945 --> 09:55.545
"Annie, okay, you caught me.

09:55.546 --> 09:57.247
"I prefer war to homework.

09:57.248 --> 09:58.832
"How do you do
that little thumb icon?

09:58.833 --> 10:00.500
I can't find it on my phone."

10:00.501 --> 10:01.735
Jeff Winger.

10:01.736 --> 10:03.370
"Jeff, you're disgusting.

10:03.371 --> 10:05.555
"Troy and Abed's friendship
is at stake.

10:05.556 --> 10:07.924
"You can buy special icons
and packages at the app store.

10:07.925 --> 10:10.927
Piece of Sushi, birthday cake,
stop sign, snowman, umbrella."

10:10.928 --> 10:12.329
Annie Edison.

10:12.330 --> 10:14.231
Narrator:
Pierce Hawthorne, humiliated

10:14.232 --> 10:15.983
in the Battle
of Big Bulletin Board,

10:15.984 --> 10:17.884
wants a chance
to redeem himself.

10:17.885 --> 10:20.771
I'm working on something.
Look at this.

10:22.556 --> 10:24.074
You can build this?

10:24.075 --> 10:26.159
[Chuckles] You just give me
the pillows.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.728
I hope to God
we'll never have to use it.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.280
Oh, me too.

10:30.281 --> 10:31.648
Narrator:
Rumors of Hawthorne's weapon

10:31.649 --> 10:33.000
find their way to Troy.

10:33.001 --> 10:34.751
Troy Barnes
will take no chances.

10:34.752 --> 10:38.355
He turns to Ben Chang,
Greendale's chief of security,

10:38.356 --> 10:40.424
rumored to be
literally psychotic,

10:40.425 --> 10:44.177
and who has been kept on
the sidelines until this moment.

10:44.178 --> 10:46.129
[Calming music]

10:46.130 --> 10:47.931
[People screaming]

10:47.932 --> 10:49.416
[Rap music]

10:49.417 --> 10:51.301
 Go, go, go 

10:51.302 --> 10:53.003
 I'm a killer, man 

10:53.004 --> 10:54.604
Aah!

10:54.605 --> 10:56.256
Narrator:
Chang has recruited an army

10:56.257 --> 10:58.525
of preteen security interns

10:58.526 --> 11:01.028
while moonlighting
at a local Bar Mitzvah.

11:01.029 --> 11:04.431
They were later nicknamed
"The Changlorious Basterds,"

11:04.432 --> 11:06.433
like Inglourious Basterds,

11:06.434 --> 11:09.036
but with "Chang"
instead of "In."

11:09.037 --> 11:10.604
I don't get it either.

11:10.605 --> 11:12.706
Most of the soldiers
in this war

11:12.707 --> 11:15.158
hadn't fought
with a pillow in years.

11:15.159 --> 11:16.993
These little bastards.

11:16.994 --> 11:19.229
Pillow fighting was
a way of life for them.

11:19.230 --> 11:21.331
One of the interns said
they were making necklaces

11:21.332 --> 11:22.799
out of mattress tags.

11:22.800 --> 11:25.669
This is when things get
as ugly as they can get...

11:25.670 --> 11:28.588
While still being
a pillow fight.

11:28.589 --> 11:29.956
"Crazy war, huh?

11:29.957 --> 11:32.342
"I heard Chang's kids
are really ducking stuff up.

11:32.343 --> 11:34.344
"Hey, check it out.
I downloaded that thing.

11:34.345 --> 11:37.247
"Birthday cake, birthday cake,
unicorn, woman's shoe.

11:37.248 --> 11:38.248
How's the nurse thing going?"

11:38.249 --> 11:40.801
No response.

11:40.802 --> 11:43.070
- [Sobbing]
- You guys like pillows?

11:43.071 --> 11:44.438
How do you like these pillows?

11:44.439 --> 11:47.074
Narrator: The Changlorious
Basterds have turned the war

11:47.075 --> 11:50.143
into a chaotic sea
of high-thread-count terror.

11:50.144 --> 11:52.279
Under advice
from his top general,

11:52.280 --> 11:55.982
Abed sees no choice but to
unleash his doomsday device.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.984
[Indistinct shouting]

12:01.038 --> 12:04.040
You're going to die,
you little [bleep] bastards!

12:04.041 --> 12:05.658
What the heck is that?

12:05.659 --> 12:07.761
Narrator:
He is part man, part pillow...

12:07.762 --> 12:11.348
All carnage.

12:11.349 --> 12:12.349
[Screaming]

12:12.350 --> 12:14.384
Pierce Hawthorne
has transformed himself

12:14.385 --> 12:18.054
into an unstoppably
plush juggernaut.

12:18.055 --> 12:20.190
Guys, guys, let's retreat.
Go, go!

12:20.191 --> 12:23.009
"The war won't stop with
First Blood part II.

12:23.010 --> 12:25.412
"It will escalate to Rambo III,
which should really be called

12:25.413 --> 12:27.347
"Rambo II:
First Blood part III.

12:27.348 --> 12:29.382
"But the Rambo titles
never made sense.

12:29.383 --> 12:31.101
And neither does war."

12:31.102 --> 12:32.402
Abed Nadir.

Why are you ignoring me?

12:47.474 --> 12:48.658
What's the point
of talking to you?

12:48.659 --> 12:50.026
Your words don't mean anything.

12:50.027 --> 12:51.844
They're just things you say
to get what you want.

12:51.845 --> 12:54.697
Well, that's what
conversation is, Annie.

12:54.698 --> 12:56.649
People saying things
to get stuff.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.300
Then maybe you
should just shut up.

12:58.301 --> 13:00.286
Do you ever just...

13:00.287 --> 13:02.355
Write stuff down
in a journal, Jeff?

13:02.356 --> 13:05.057
One you don't show people
or use to get anything with?

13:05.058 --> 13:07.293
A place
that's just for you to...

13:07.294 --> 13:08.594
Sort out the truth?

13:08.595 --> 13:09.845
If I write stuff down
in a Hello Kitty book,

13:09.846 --> 13:12.048
will you like me again?

13:12.049 --> 13:13.132
[Sighs]

13:13.133 --> 13:15.685
I'm taking that as yes.

13:15.686 --> 13:17.970
Narrator: The war brings out
the worst in people.

13:17.971 --> 13:21.223
Worse yet, Troy's forces
intercept an e-mail

13:21.224 --> 13:23.275
written by Abed
to his commanders,

13:23.276 --> 13:25.428
outlining Troy's weaknesses.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.780
"Troy will hold on
until he is broken emotionally.

13:27.781 --> 13:29.448
"Fortunately,
this will not be hard.

13:29.449 --> 13:31.183
"He gets distracted
by loud noises,

13:31.184 --> 13:33.586
"the color red,
smooth jazz, shiny things

13:33.587 --> 13:35.654
"food smells, music boxes,
bellbottoms,

13:35.655 --> 13:38.424
"boobs, barking dogs, and anyone
saying, "Look over there!"

13:38.425 --> 13:40.793
"He's insecure about his level
of intelligence.

13:40.794 --> 13:43.329
"His greatest vulnerability of
all is his emotional frailty.

13:43.330 --> 13:45.047
"It's incredibly easy
to make him cry.

13:45.048 --> 13:46.766
And he's incredibly ashamed
of that fact."

13:46.767 --> 13:48.050
Get away!

13:48.051 --> 13:49.301
Narrator: Unfortunately,
the only photographer there

13:49.302 --> 13:51.670
to capture the scene
is Britta Perry.

13:51.671 --> 13:54.073
[Camera snaps]
Yeah, gee.

13:54.074 --> 13:55.658
There's a good one.

13:55.659 --> 13:57.426
Pictured here lying down,

13:57.427 --> 14:00.846
Troy's does not take
Abed's e-mail lying down.

14:03.266 --> 14:05.267
"Really enjoyed it.

14:05.268 --> 14:06.652
"You may have been
my best friend,

14:06.653 --> 14:08.571
"but we both know
I was your first friend.

"And what I know
but you don't know

14:10.123 --> 14:11.524
"because you have mental issues

14:11.525 --> 14:13.492
"is that you're never going
to have another friend.

"Because... all caps...
nobody else will ever have

Four-part text message.

14:21.585 --> 14:23.102
Word got around these two

14:23.103 --> 14:25.704
were now hurting
each other's feelings.

14:25.705 --> 14:28.557
And I thought
about what Annie said,

14:28.558 --> 14:30.042
and then I thought about

14:30.043 --> 14:32.745
what I might do
to make things right.

14:32.746 --> 14:34.847
Narrator: At 8:00 P.M.
of the second night,

14:34.848 --> 14:37.249
both sides are honoring
an agreed upon cease-fire

14:37.250 --> 14:39.802
so that the infantry
can watch the hit TV show

14:39.803 --> 14:41.403
Ski, Shoot, Sing,

14:41.404 --> 14:44.356
a combination biathlon
singing competition,

14:44.357 --> 14:46.308
which was no fun
to watch time-shifted

14:46.309 --> 14:48.644
because then you'd be
the last to know who won.

14:48.645 --> 14:50.179
During the cease-fire,

14:50.180 --> 14:53.566
Jeff summons Troy and Abed
to a secret summit meeting.

14:53.567 --> 14:55.434
- This has to stop.
- Tell him.

14:55.435 --> 14:56.535
Me?
What about your e-mail?

14:56.536 --> 14:57.820
You weren't supposed
to see that.

14:57.821 --> 14:58.904
You weren't supposed
to think those things.

14:58.905 --> 15:01.273
Guys, look at yourselves.

15:01.274 --> 15:02.992
You didn't
used to be like this.

15:02.993 --> 15:06.695
You were Troy and Abed.
Things used to be easy.

15:06.696 --> 15:08.530
He's right.

15:08.531 --> 15:10.916
Our friendship is dead.
What?

15:10.917 --> 15:12.668
Yeah, I think we should agree
right now

15:12.669 --> 15:15.304
that whoever wins this war
can stay in the apartment.

15:15.305 --> 15:16.872
Loser has to find a new place.

15:16.873 --> 15:19.875
Agreed.

15:22.145 --> 15:24.763
Uh, I wanted that
to go different.

named after
admiral William North,

is located in the western
portion of East Hall,

15:35.208 --> 15:37.393
gateway to the western half
of North Hall,

15:37.394 --> 15:39.445
which is named
not after William North,

15:39.446 --> 15:41.881
but for its position
above the South Wall.

15:41.882 --> 15:44.566
It is the most contested
and confusing battlefield

15:44.567 --> 15:45.985
on Greendale's campus,

15:45.986 --> 15:48.170
next to the English Memorial
Spanish Center,

15:48.171 --> 15:50.089
named after English Memorial,

15:50.090 --> 15:52.458
a portuguese sailor
that discovered Greendale

15:52.459 --> 15:55.377
while looking for a fountain
that cured syphilis.

15:55.378 --> 15:58.931
In a fit of hurt feelings, Troy
redirects most of his infantry

15:58.932 --> 16:00.182
to the Cafeteria.

16:00.183 --> 16:02.384
They arrive at the same time

16:02.385 --> 16:04.770
as 100 Pillowtown troops.

16:08.391 --> 16:13.229
Just after dawn,
the end of the war begins.

I'm dead, I'm dead.

[Heroic music]

[Whistle blowing]

17:16.960 --> 17:18.093
Well, that's it.

17:18.094 --> 17:19.762
I just heard
from the Guinness rep.

17:19.762 --> 17:20.846
He's not coming.

17:20.847 --> 17:23.165
He's been fired,
in what he described

17:23.165 --> 17:25.166
as the world's biggest mistake.

17:25.167 --> 17:27.685
I doubt that will make
the next edition.

17:27.686 --> 17:28.971
Anyway, it's over.

17:28.972 --> 17:33.675
What a colossal waste
of 2 1/2 days.

17:33.676 --> 17:36.812
Narrator: The war has
no more reason to continue,

17:36.813 --> 17:41.350
and yet it does
between the two that began it.

17:41.351 --> 17:43.569
They just kept fighting.

17:43.570 --> 17:48.574
Like, for hours.

17:48.575 --> 17:49.575
Come on, guys.
Let's wrap this up.

17:49.576 --> 17:50.576
I don't want to.

17:50.577 --> 17:52.111
- Me neither.
- Why not?

17:52.112 --> 17:53.862
This is going to be the last
thing we ever do together.

17:53.863 --> 17:55.530
We can't stop.

17:55.531 --> 17:58.033
Doesn't that
kind of solve your problem?

17:58.034 --> 17:59.918
The realization that you
like each other so much,

17:59.919 --> 18:03.538
you'd hit each other
with pillows forever?

18:03.539 --> 18:06.258
Knowing that doesn't
feel like enough anymore.

18:06.259 --> 18:07.926
Yeah.
We're grown-ups now.

18:07.927 --> 18:08.961
We have grown-up problems.

18:08.962 --> 18:12.298
That's very clear.

18:12.299 --> 18:14.900
Unless...

18:14.901 --> 18:17.670
You use those magical friendship
hats that I got for you.

18:17.671 --> 18:20.055
We're not stupid, Jeffrey.

18:20.056 --> 18:21.607
We know you made those
sarcastically.

18:21.608 --> 18:22.775
Yes, yes.

18:22.776 --> 18:24.743
And I will roll my eyes
at both of you

18:24.744 --> 18:28.897
when I put them on your heads
because that's the way I am.

18:28.898 --> 18:33.085
But that's not the way
you have to be.

18:41.211 --> 18:42.411
We might be interested.

18:42.412 --> 18:45.914
Okay, then.

18:45.915 --> 18:48.050
Here's your magical
Friendship Hat, and...

18:48.051 --> 18:50.135
- Jeff.
- What?

18:50.136 --> 18:51.720
You left the magical
Friendship Hats

18:51.721 --> 18:54.089
at the Dean's office.

18:54.090 --> 18:55.224
Right.

18:55.225 --> 18:58.110
Of course.
I'll go get them.

18:58.111 --> 18:59.428
So Jeff went out,

18:59.429 --> 19:01.397
and he stayed out long enough
to make them believe

19:01.398 --> 19:03.449
he had gone back to the office.

19:03.450 --> 19:05.501
That was a nice touch.
[Laughs]

19:08.905 --> 19:11.323
There you go.

19:11.324 --> 19:14.660
Lucky no one grabbed them, huh?

19:17.664 --> 19:18.831
[Camera snaps]

19:18.832 --> 19:20.366
Narrator: Britta Perry
is there to immortalize

19:20.367 --> 19:22.134
the moment on film...

19:22.135 --> 19:24.970
Accidentally while trying
to get a picture of the light

19:24.971 --> 19:27.306
hitting a stack
of nearby waffles.

19:27.307 --> 19:28.974
Pierce, take that off.

19:28.975 --> 19:31.093
I can't hear you!
Your cheeks are in the way.

19:31.094 --> 19:32.895
First entry
in my stupid journal.

19:32.896 --> 19:35.814
Today I had to run and get
two imaginary Friendship Hats

19:35.815 --> 19:37.015
from an office.

19:37.016 --> 19:38.517
I could've just walked
around the corner

19:38.518 --> 19:40.552
and the come back,
but for some reason,

19:40.553 --> 19:42.071
I actually went
all the way back

19:42.072 --> 19:43.638
to where they were
supposed to be.

19:43.639 --> 19:45.774
One was crumpled up a bit.
That was Troy's.

19:45.775 --> 19:48.077
The other was just a little
dusty. That was Abed's.

19:48.078 --> 19:51.230
I fixed them up even though
I was the only one watching

19:51.231 --> 19:53.482
because I settled on
a truth today

19:53.483 --> 19:55.167
that's always going to be true.

19:55.168 --> 19:57.819
I would do anything
for my friends,

19:57.820 --> 20:00.205
which I think is how everyone
in the world feels,

20:00.206 --> 20:03.208
which finally makes me
understand war.

20:04.961 --> 20:07.930
Guys...

20:07.931 --> 20:09.598
I wasn't going
to show this to anyone,

20:09.599 --> 20:11.683
but, uh, it's pretty profound.

20:11.684 --> 20:13.519
I kind of nailed it.

20:13.520 --> 20:16.271
If you want, I can read it
in the documentary.

20:16.272 --> 20:18.006
That is,
unless you get Tom Hanks.

20:18.007 --> 20:19.191
Narrator:
We tried to get Tom Hanks,

20:19.192 --> 20:20.509
but he's too expensive.

20:20.510 --> 20:23.395
So we used the people involved
for their own voiceover.

20:23.396 --> 20:25.230
Yeah, and I nailed that too.

20:25.231 --> 20:26.532
Narrator: Why are you here
at the same time as me?

20:26.533 --> 20:27.682
Tight schedule.

20:27.683 --> 20:30.519
- Hey, were you in The Cape?
- No.

20:38.057 --> 20:39.057
[Phone rings]
Wow.

20:39.058 --> 20:40.508
- Mm.
- I've got goosebumps.

20:40.509 --> 20:41.726
Me too.
Such a great story.

20:41.727 --> 20:43.344
I was on the edge of my seat,
and I was in it.

20:43.345 --> 20:44.812
You want to know what
struck me while I was watching

20:44.813 --> 20:46.230
- that marvelous documentary?
- Hmm?

20:46.231 --> 20:47.799
You can't get quality
programming like that

20:47.800 --> 20:49.534
anywhere else but right here
on Greendale Campus Television.

20:49.535 --> 20:51.319
Just thinking that same thing.

20:51.320 --> 20:53.371
You can't get Troy and Abed:
Pillows and Blankets.

20:53.372 --> 20:54.789
Or any of these other
great specials,

20:54.790 --> 20:56.591
like Craig Pelton:
A Year in Paris.

20:56.592 --> 20:58.993
From Labs to Riches:
The Annie's Boobs Story

20:58.994 --> 21:00.528
or That's Enter-Chang-Ment.

21:00.529 --> 21:03.331
Folks, we know you hate
these constant pledge drives.

21:03.332 --> 21:04.665
We know you hate them.
We don't love doing them.

21:04.666 --> 21:05.833
We don't like
doing them either.

21:05.834 --> 21:07.469
- I'd rather be at home right now.
- Mm-hmm.

21:07.470 --> 21:09.797
Okay, taking a warm bath
with my wife.

21:10.764 --> 21:13.016
But if you want to help us out,

21:13.017 --> 21:14.798
if you want to help
Greendale Campus Television

21:14.799 --> 21:16.630
to stay on the air,
keep the lights on.

21:16.631 --> 21:18.986
We are literally this close
to losing our...
