No. No, I'm not.

06:16.683 --> 06:19.852
But listen, I've...

06:20.187 --> 06:22.622
I've had time to think about
the pressure that you've been

06:22.623 --> 06:25.057
under all these years, the fear
that you've been living with,

06:25.392 --> 06:27.527

you could have, too,

11:59.042 --> 12:00.876
- Nothing.
- Good.

12:01.211 --> 12:03.979
Flimsy denials don't suit you, Kai.

12:04.014 --> 12:07.183
- You've always been a straight talker.
- Why don't you call off

12:07.184 --> 12:10.352
your dogs and let us
discuss what needs discussing?

12:10.753 --> 12:12.888

15:27.777 --> 15:29.545

15:29.579 --> 15:32.081

They're a crime syndicate

16:34.142 --> 16:35.709
- We're not gonna do anything.
- What are you talking about?

16:36.144 --> 16:37.478
- I don't give a shit about Proctor.
- Neither do I.

16:37.512 --> 16:39.880
But the crazy niece, she told me
they also took my ex-wife Emily.

16:39.914 --> 16:42.015
What? What does she
have to do with Proctor?

16:42.984 --> 16:44.818
She took care of his mother.

16:45.186 --> 16:47.153
- His mother's dead, Brock.

16:49.323 --> 16:52.451
- Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

16:52.486 --> 16:54.644
Look, I'm gonna have Bunker

16:56.798 --> 16:58.531
No, no, no, they're

16:58.865 --> 17:00.100
Yeah. Maybe they're not, all right?
We've gotta do something.

17:00.134 --> 17:03.503
- Brock, I'm not gonna get involved.
- No, listen to me, Hood!

17:04.003 --> 17:07.373

17:51.884 --> 17:54.585
I think you killed some of them twice,
you trigger-happy son of a bitch.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.688
There's gonna be more of them.
We need to keep moving.

17:56.889 --> 17:58.523

18:05.764 --> 18:06.930
We just ran, like, three miles.

18:07.232 --> 18:10.067
- My feet are fucking killing me.
- Talk less, you can breathe more.

18:10.402 --> 18:11.602
<i>I'll tell you what, Clint Eastwood,</i>

18:11.637 --> 18:13.471

18:13.738 --> 18:15.273
where the fuck are we going?!

18:15.574 --> 18:19.009
We need to get off the street.
Move.

18:19.278 --> 18:21.912
You didn't answer my question!

18:32.623 --> 18:35.592
I got a place.

18:41.932 --> 18:43.200
I reviewed the digital security logs

18:43.234 --> 18:45.101
from Sterling Safe's
headquarters in Virginia.

18:45.436 --> 18:46.703
No obvious mainframe breaches,

18:46.737 --> 18:49.673
no embedded viruses or brute
force attacks from the outside.

18:50.107 --> 18:52.775
That's why I looked for something
a little bit more inside.

18:53.143 --> 18:55.978
Sterling meticulously vets
all private contractors.

18:56.013 --> 18:57.914
The process takes a month,
so the sudden addition

18:58.281 --> 18:59.548
of two new maintenance
workers didn't make sense,

18:59.983 --> 19:02.318
especially since they were
deleted less than 24 hours later.

19:02.619 --> 19:05.722
- They made a mistake?
- No, I just got lucky.

19:05.756 --> 19:07.590
The files were scrubbed and overwritten.

19:07.958 --> 19:09.491
I would never have found
them if not for a power surge

19:09.827 --> 19:11.527
that triggered an off-site data backup.

19:11.561 --> 19:13.429
That's Sugar Bates.

19:13.796 --> 19:17.266
Ex-prizefighter, local
bartender, and an ex-con.

19:17.634 --> 19:20.068
<i>- Robbery?
- Aggravated assault.</i>

19:20.470 --> 19:23.105
Mr. Bates solves his problems
with brute force, not skill.

19:23.473 --> 19:25.907
<i>He was the van driver.
Who's that?</i>

19:25.942 --> 19:28.076
Well, that's the question, isn't it?

19:28.510 --> 19:30.846
I cross-referenced every facial
recognition database there is...

19:30.880 --> 19:33.514
NSA, MSS, Mossad.

19:33.850 --> 19:37.052
Either this guy is completely
invisible to all surveillance

19:37.053 --> 19:40.577
cameras and spy satellites,
or he's managed to exploit

19:40.656 --> 19:42.490
the most secure computer
systems ever designed.

19:42.524 --> 19:46.761
- [scoffs] He's a hacker.
- If I'm right, he's the hacker.

19:46.795 --> 19:49.664
<i>CIA's been chasing their tails
for years trying to find this guy.</i>

19:49.998 --> 19:52.967
The online fanboys, they call him Job.

19:53.335 --> 19:55.836
But nobody knows for
sure who he really is.

Save your strength.
You're going to need it.

[coughs]

40:49.083 --> 40:52.953
It's funny how things work out.
Don't you think?

40:57.257 --> 40:59.559
I am curious, though.

41:02.229 --> 41:04.897
Was the decision to steal
my money made before or...

41:07.901 --> 41:10.470
or after you spread your legs for me?

41:13.440 --> 41:15.674
Do you really think I'd fuck you
 if I didn't have to?

41:15.909 --> 41:18.944
[laughs]

41:25.585 --> 41:26.552
Give me the name of your fourth,

41:26.920 --> 41:28.921
and I'll keep your
suffering to a minimum.

41:32.759 --> 41:34.126
No.

41:36.429 --> 41:38.963
[grunts]
Give me a fucking name now!

41:39.265 --> 41:41.766
Fuck you.
[grunts]

41:41.967 --> 41:44.503
[chuckles]

41:44.937 --> 41:48.573
One way or another, I will find
the person you're protecting.

41:48.974 --> 41:53.077
Only question is, how much of you
is going to be left by the time I do?

41:57.731 --> 42:01.006

42:57.174 --> 42:59.942
What the fuck, Hood?
You had no right taking Deva home.

43:00.376 --> 43:03.212
Now you listen to me. 
You stay the hell away from my daughter!

Where's Ana?

43:14.357 --> 43:16.525
- What?
- Where is your wife?

43:19.862 --> 43:22.731
Jesus Christ, what the
fuck did you do now?
