00:06.506 --> 00:07.924
-Hey, Peyton.
-[Peyton cries]

00:08.133 --> 00:09.676
-All right, you're okay.
-[still crying]

00:09.759 --> 00:11.177
-This is Mr. TV.
-[still crying]

00:11.261 --> 00:13.638
Well, I know it don't look like much now,

00:13.722 --> 00:15.890
but that's gonna be your best friend

00:15.974 --> 00:18.059
-and your babysitter.
-[cries louder]

00:18.685 --> 00:22.272
More like your half-hour a day
source for educational programming.

00:22.522 --> 00:23.648
[Peyton still cries]

00:24.858 --> 00:27.819
-She didn't mean it, babe. It's all right.
-[Peyton cries louder]

00:27.902 --> 00:30.739
I promise, the first four letters
you're gonna learn are gonna be "ESPN."

00:31.322 --> 00:32.699
[still crying]

00:33.825 --> 00:35.994
That's all right, you're okay.

00:36.494 --> 00:37.704
-[still cries]
-[Colt] Come on.

00:38.246 --> 00:40.331
Come on. Maybe she's hungry.

00:40.415 --> 00:41.624
No, I already fed her.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.711
-[still crying]
-All right, well, let's check your diaper.

00:45.503 --> 00:47.964
-All right. Whoa, easy there, partner.
-[still crying]

00:48.048 --> 00:48.965
[Abby chuckles]

00:49.966 --> 00:51.092
[Peyton screams]

00:51.593 --> 00:53.845
They should make these things
like Coors cans.

00:54.512 --> 00:57.891
Like, a little dinosaur on 'em
that turns blue if they pee in 'em.

00:58.641 --> 00:59.851
No, she's dry.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.103
Holy shit.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.522
That's like a million-dollar idea.

01:04.606 --> 01:05.690
Hello, sharks.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.944
No, it's already a thing, okay,
and she's in 'em.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.530
And, no, you can't put one on
to see it in action.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.949
-Let's bring her to my mom.
-[Peyton cries]

01:15.033 --> 01:17.786
Colt, we can't bring her to your mom
every time she cries.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.245
[Peyton cries loudly]

01:19.454 --> 01:21.998
I mean we don't want to rob her
of bonding with her grandmother.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.000
[still crying]

01:26.294 --> 01:27.253
[screams]

01:29.089 --> 01:31.091
[Abby] Shh.

01:31.508 --> 01:34.969
Hey, guys, we tried everythin'.
You got any advice?

01:35.053 --> 01:38.014
Yeah, become a grandparent
so it's not your problem.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.018
-[Peyton screams]
-Here, let me try.

01:46.731 --> 01:47.649
[crying continues]

01:47.816 --> 01:49.651
It's okay, Peyton.

01:49.734 --> 01:51.194
You gotta stop cryin'.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.780
You don't wanna be like your dad

01:53.863 --> 01:55.406
-or a Democrat.
-[Peyton quietens]

01:55.698 --> 01:56.741
What?

01:56.825 --> 02:00.120
Are you kidding me?
All I had to do was make fun of Colt?

02:01.621 --> 02:05.875
Yeah, I can never tell if babies like him
or they're just scared of his mustache.

02:06.543 --> 02:09.420
-[distant car engine]
-Well, someone's coming.

02:12.924 --> 02:15.176
Remember that week
the tree fell across the drive

02:16.094 --> 02:17.929
and no one could make it up to the house?

02:19.055 --> 02:20.140
I enjoyed that.

02:21.683 --> 02:24.477
Oh, it's a cop car. Colt, what did you do?

02:24.978 --> 02:25.812
[sighs]

02:25.937 --> 02:28.189
If this has to do
with that lactation consultant,

02:28.273 --> 02:32.152
I swear to God I wasn't takin' pictures,
I was textin' a friend.

02:32.235 --> 02:33.778
[vehicle approaches]

02:39.075 --> 02:39.951
Hey, there.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.496
I heard about the baby. Congratulations.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.416
Thanks, Wilkerson.

02:46.499 --> 02:49.627
We're gonna feed her in about 30 minutes,
if you wanna stick around.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.633
What can we do for you, son?

02:55.717 --> 02:58.136
Well, I picked up this guy for drunk
and disorderly.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.680
Says he's related to you.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.098
[drunk] Oh! Jeez!

03:04.475 --> 03:06.978
What the hell, man? I said Taco Bell.

03:09.898 --> 03:13.484
Handsome, drunk...
Yeah, he looks like one of us.

-[drunk] Oh!

04:23.346 --> 04:24.722
Thanks for the ride, little guy.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.557
'Preciate it.

04:28.226 --> 04:31.354
Sorry I tugged on your mustache
when you put me in the car.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.816
Thought you were a little kid
playing dress-up.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.443
Yeah, I like you.

04:39.237 --> 04:42.490
You know, he borrowed that holster
from the Woody doll in <i>Toy Story.</i>

04:45.368 --> 04:46.995
All right, you know what?

04:47.078 --> 04:48.997
-This guy's your problem now.
-[Colt] Oh, yeah?

04:49.580 --> 04:51.958
Where are you headin'?
Infinity and beyond?

04:52.208 --> 04:54.544
-[Colt laughs]
-[drunk guffaws]

04:54.836 --> 04:56.796
That's Buzz Lightyear, asshole.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.221
Who are you, son?

05:06.681 --> 05:08.182
I'm Luke Matthews, sir.

05:09.058 --> 05:11.144
"Luke," as in, "Luke Skywalker."

05:12.937 --> 05:15.606
"Matthews" as in, "More than one Matthew."

05:18.693 --> 05:20.236
My mom, just before she passed,

05:20.320 --> 05:22.572
she told me that my dad died
in Vietnam and...

05:23.364 --> 05:25.158
his name was Greg Bennett.

05:26.117 --> 05:27.076
Oh my God.

05:27.952 --> 05:29.287
Your brother had a son?

05:30.288 --> 05:32.749
There must be some mistake.
He didn't have a son.

05:33.916 --> 05:35.585
He met my mom on leave.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.879
She was living in Hawaii at the time.

05:38.713 --> 05:39.714
And...

05:40.590 --> 05:42.925
If I made waffles, would anyone want some?

05:45.720 --> 05:47.305
Y'know, I think we're fine, Luke.

05:47.722 --> 05:48.931
Well, hold on.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.562
I remember, he did say he met a...

05:55.355 --> 05:59.275
college girl in Hawaii
when he went there on R&R once.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.320
Not sure why he went there.

06:02.904 --> 06:07.200
Grown men walking around in sandals,
wearing shirts with flowers on 'em...

06:10.828 --> 06:12.830
No wonder the Japanese attacked.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.668
How do we know you're telling the truth?

06:18.002 --> 06:19.420
I brought a picture.

06:20.338 --> 06:21.255
That's him.

06:22.256 --> 06:24.258
I don't know who that crazy old dude is.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.427
That's Beau's mother.

06:28.596 --> 06:29.847
She's beautiful, sir.

06:31.682 --> 06:34.352
She has that lovely Bennett mustache.

06:38.731 --> 06:39.607
My goodness.

06:41.317 --> 06:42.652
I took this picture.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.614
That's Greg standing by that truck
the day we bought it.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.326
He drove that thing everywhere.

06:50.993 --> 06:53.746
Drove it up to Glacier National Park
one time.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.334
Since we were so close
we drove on up to the Canadian border

06:58.418 --> 07:00.253
just to flip off a Mountie.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.215
Glad you found us, Luke.

07:04.298 --> 07:05.383
[snores quietly]

07:11.013 --> 07:12.348
I liked your story, Dad.

07:12.890 --> 07:14.892
[Luke snores louder]

07:23.192 --> 07:24.610
Maggie, hey.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.070
Yeah, I got your text.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.323
-You look pretty good for having the flu.
-Shit.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.366
Busted.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.618
Darlene called me in a panic,

07:32.702 --> 07:34.036
sayin' her babysitter canceled.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.581
She can't take the baby to work anymore
since she got in trouble

07:36.664 --> 07:38.666
for using the stripper cage as a playpen.

07:39.375 --> 07:41.502
Mary, I'm not an idiot.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.129
I talked to Maria again.

07:43.212 --> 07:45.923
-And she said--
-Oh my God. Why are you still on this?

07:46.007 --> 07:47.717
Look, Maggie, you haven't been around.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.136
Maria's been stealing everything
that wasn't nailed down.

07:50.219 --> 07:52.388
The lost and found bin,
totally cleaned out.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.183
Now I don't have any prizes
to give out for trivia night.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.851
Look, just stop.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.187
I know when people are lying.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.022
I raised Colt and Rooster.

08:02.231 --> 08:04.233
I'm not lying. I don't...

08:04.317 --> 08:07.153
I saw you take that Xanax
from Abby's mom,

08:07.236 --> 08:09.071
and that woman clearly needs it.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.450
I already told you
she said I could have some.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.368
It was just... It was for a headache.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.413
Are you high right now?

08:17.497 --> 08:19.499
What? No, I-- No!

08:19.582 --> 08:21.959
Again, I raised Colt and Rooster.

08:23.377 --> 08:27.381
Look, the bottom line is, I just don't
want you working at the bar anymore.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.343
You're firing me?

08:30.426 --> 08:32.261
I'm sorry. I don't--

08:32.345 --> 08:35.848
No, why am I apologizing?
I trusted you and you let me down.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.225
Good luck, Mary.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.813
Y'know what?
I don't even need that stupid job.

08:42.897 --> 08:46.108
I only answered the door
'cause I thought you were a fuckin' pizza!

08:49.737 --> 08:52.615
-[Peyton cries]
-[Abby] Shh.

08:54.825 --> 08:57.119
[whispers] It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

08:57.411 --> 08:58.704
[cries louder]

08:59.372 --> 09:01.374
[Colt] Oh my God, what are you doin'?

09:01.499 --> 09:02.667
[Peyton still cries]

09:02.833 --> 09:03.960
Seriously?

09:04.502 --> 09:07.004
I thought it would be fun
to get up at 3 a.m.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.090
and walk around, make her cry.

09:11.592 --> 09:14.512
-[Peyton still cries]
-Have you tried the five "S"s?

09:14.595 --> 09:17.557
Side, swaddle, sucking...

09:18.182 --> 09:20.268
-[Peyton cries]
<i>-...Sharknado?</i>

09:21.978 --> 09:23.437
[Abby] Shush!

09:23.521 --> 09:25.064
[Colt] Babe, I'm trying to help.

09:25.147 --> 09:28.109
No, the fifth "S" is "shush."
Also, shush the fuck up!

09:29.694 --> 09:31.153
[Peyton cries]

09:31.237 --> 09:32.488
Sorry, I'm sorry.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.741
We've gotten like two hours' sleep total
in the last four nights.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.034
-Have you fed her?
-Yes,

09:37.118 --> 09:38.953
of course I fed her.

09:39.870 --> 09:42.832
You wanna take her? She gets
this cryin' thing from you anyway.

09:45.334 --> 09:47.461
No, I think she's cryin'
'cause you're being a bit...

09:48.504 --> 09:50.298
un... fair.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.759
[Peyton still cries]

09:56.929 --> 09:59.056
-Give her over.
-All right.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.350
[Colt] All right. Come on.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.685
-I know. Come on.
-[still cries]

10:03.561 --> 10:04.520
Come on.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.522
All right, Peyton.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.816
Peyton? Peyton, look at me.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.443
Lock it up.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.987
-[Peyton screams]
-[Colt] Stop.

10:13.070 --> 10:14.196
Just stop crying.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.574
Colt, she doesn't understand
what you're saying.

10:16.657 --> 10:19.118
-That's like me talking to you about math.
-You know what?

10:19.201 --> 10:20.369
You woke me up,

10:20.453 --> 10:22.246
you asked me to help and I'm helping,

10:22.330 --> 10:24.165
and 'cause I'm not doing it your way,

10:24.248 --> 10:26.000
-I'm doing it the wrong way?
-Shh. Stop.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.126
She stopped crying.

10:28.961 --> 10:29.962
Oh my God.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.465
I'm a better parent than you.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.342
You're about to be a single parent!

10:34.425 --> 10:35.426
[Peyton cries]

10:35.551 --> 10:37.178
Way to go. You woke her up.

10:37.261 --> 10:38.554
[Peyton screams]

10:43.434 --> 10:45.227
-Pop Pop.
-Hey.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.521
Luke's still asleep on the couch,

10:47.605 --> 10:49.649
so happy, peaceful...

10:50.024 --> 10:52.193
I wanna punch him in the fuckin' face.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.822
[Beau] I still can't believe
my brother had a son.

10:56.906 --> 10:57.907
[Colt] Yeah, right?

10:57.990 --> 11:00.951
Holy shit. I just realized something.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.538
You're Beau, he's Luke,
that's the fuckin' <i>Dukes of Hazzard.</i>

11:07.708 --> 11:09.502
I guess that makes you Daisy.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.047
Whatever.

11:13.130 --> 11:16.217
We both know I've got the legs
to pull off them Daisy Dukes.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.555
[Colt] Hey, partner.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.059
You been passed out
on that couch all morning.

11:25.726 --> 11:28.813
You're lucky I'm a dad
or I'd have drawed a dick on your face.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.236
You could've drawn a dick
playing catch with a littler dick.

11:37.863 --> 11:38.948
Hey, I'm, er...

11:39.031 --> 11:40.866
I'm sorry about last night. I...

11:40.950 --> 11:43.536
I feel like an asshole.
I drank way too much.

11:43.619 --> 11:44.704
Yeah.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.706
We don't drink much around here.
[laughs]

11:46.789 --> 11:49.250
[laughing] Yeah, I'm sorry.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.293
I can't even say that
with a straight face.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.878
Goddamn, I love beer.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.214
Yep.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.509
I was a little anxious
about meeting you guys,

11:58.592 --> 12:02.304
so once I checked into the campground,
I had a few beers to take the edge off.

12:03.347 --> 12:07.143
Next thing I know, I'm wearing
a 12-pack box as a hat, and...

12:07.893 --> 12:10.938
asking that chubby little Deputy Dawg
to fetch me a chalupa.

12:14.775 --> 12:16.610
What the fuck is a "chalupa"?

12:19.655 --> 12:20.656
He's joking, right?

12:22.324 --> 12:23.409
He don't do that.

12:25.619 --> 12:26.495
Well...

12:27.455 --> 12:30.124
Suffice to say, not the impression
I was hoping to make.

12:30.666 --> 12:33.085
Just wanted to stop by
and say hi on my way to California.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.795
[Beau sniggers]

12:36.756 --> 12:39.508
If you didn't wanna make a bad impression
you shouldn't have told us

12:39.592 --> 12:41.802
-you were heading for California.
-[Colt laughs]

12:41.886 --> 12:44.555
Well, I got a buddy out there
that's got a lead on a job.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.683
He owns a bowling alley.
He's making five figures a week.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.520
I mean, he's selling drugs
out the back. Erm...

12:53.522 --> 12:54.398
But...

12:54.482 --> 12:57.401
turns out he still needs someone
to do all the bowling alley stuff, so...

12:59.570 --> 13:00.988
What's going on with this truck?

13:01.739 --> 13:03.741
Big old engine finally gave out.

13:03.824 --> 13:06.535
-Put a new one in but it's running rough.
-[Colt] Yeah.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.078
Well, it's new to us.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.581
We got it from Donnie,
over at the junkyard.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.416
Scored a great deal on it, though,

13:12.500 --> 13:14.502
'cause Donnie's Doberman bit me.

13:16.170 --> 13:19.965
Sucker. The old Slim Jim in the sock trick
works every time.

13:22.218 --> 13:25.930
Maybe next time put it in your underpants,
might drive out with a new truck.

13:33.395 --> 13:36.190
Want me to take a look at this truck?
I used to work on them in Iraq.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.983
Yeah, be my guest.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.694
What branch were you in?

13:41.278 --> 13:43.030
Army or Marines?

13:43.113 --> 13:44.949
Please don't say the Navy.

13:45.115 --> 13:46.283
[Luke chuckles]

13:46.408 --> 13:48.911
Army. I joined right outta high school.
There you go.

13:49.954 --> 13:53.499
I thought it'd be a great way
to get out of Michigan and see the world.

13:55.334 --> 13:58.963
Also, I wanted a job
where I could blow shit up, y'know?

14:01.549 --> 14:03.801
-We're gonna be best friends.
-[Luke chuckles]

14:04.552 --> 14:06.011
On to more important shit,

14:06.095 --> 14:07.721
who's your football team?

14:08.389 --> 14:11.684
I'm from the Detroit area
so I'm a Cowboys fan.

14:14.436 --> 14:16.564
Good God. Cowboys...

14:16.647 --> 14:18.566
the Navy of the NFL.

14:22.611 --> 14:25.406
I gotta say, I can't believe
I'm workin' on my dad's truck.

14:26.448 --> 14:27.950
I used to dream about this.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.120
I mean, in my dream he was an astronaut.

14:32.454 --> 14:35.165
Closest your dad ever came
to being an astronaut

14:35.249 --> 14:38.252
was the time I shot a bottle rocket off
under his ass.

14:40.588 --> 14:43.716
Holy shit. Wait... you used to be fun?

14:47.094 --> 14:47.970
No.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.808
Well, I think I know
what's going on with this.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.227
I bet this motor's from a lower elevation.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.938
I think if we re-jet that car
we should be good.

14:59.148 --> 15:02.151
How about that? Good call.
You know how to fix a baby?

15:03.444 --> 15:04.737
What the fuck?!

15:04.820 --> 15:05.988
Sorry about that.

15:06.071 --> 15:09.491
Come on, man. My fucking head's inside
there, you're smashing a light bulb?

15:09.575 --> 15:10.784
-Easy, son.
-Easy?! No--

15:10.868 --> 15:13.078
-[Colt] Back away, partner--
-Don't fuckin' touch me!

15:13.162 --> 15:15.497
You better get the fuck out of here
or I'll kick your ass.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.333
You're gonna kick my ass?

15:22.379 --> 15:23.380
Fuck this.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.257
Whatever. Have fun.

15:28.385 --> 15:30.554
Have fun in California, fuckface.

15:35.392 --> 15:36.644
[Peyton gurgles]

15:37.978 --> 15:38.938
[softly] Hey.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.231
[Colt] Oh my God.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.692
-I'm so tired, babe.
-[Abby] Mm.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.821
-[sighs] You just finished feedin' her?
-Yeah.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.616
Who did the job? Was it Brooks or Dunn?

15:52.576 --> 15:54.411
Will you stop calling my boobs that?

15:55.287 --> 15:56.830
[giggling] It was Dunn.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.958
[laughs] Brooks is chafed pretty bad.

16:01.794 --> 16:02.836
How was your day?

16:03.545 --> 16:05.631
Did Luke ever come back
after freakin' out?

16:06.215 --> 16:08.175
No. It was probably for the best.

16:10.511 --> 16:11.720
That was so weird.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.722
The guy's like a time-bomb.

16:14.515 --> 16:17.977
When he showed up and fell outta
the cop car and passed out drunk,

16:18.060 --> 16:19.311
he seemed like a good guy.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.022
I know.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.108
Woulda been nice to get to know him.

16:24.191 --> 16:25.859
He didn't even make us waffles.

16:32.616 --> 16:34.451
[quietly] Oh, she's sleeping!

16:36.996 --> 16:38.956
-[Colt] Oh my God, are you serious?
-[softly] Yeah.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.250
[Colt] Oh! Let's go to bed.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.502
-It's gotta be like midnight.
-[Abby laughs]

16:43.669 --> 16:45.587
-It's 6:30.
-Fine.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.132
I don't care.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.218
I'm so tired.

16:51.802 --> 16:54.722
I don't even care if Brooks and Dunn
come out for a late-night show...

16:54.805 --> 16:56.098
[Abby chuckles]

16:56.181 --> 16:57.224
Although...

16:57.891 --> 17:00.269
if I had a backstage pass...

17:00.352 --> 17:01.645
You don't.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.273
[both moan contentedly]

17:06.150 --> 17:07.693
-Gosh.
-This is so good.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.404
Why don't we get to bed early every night?

17:11.447 --> 17:13.407
Old people are <i>so</i> smart.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.201
[Peyton cries]

17:16.994 --> 17:18.620
-No. No!
-[Colt giggles]

17:19.163 --> 17:21.290
-No. Nooo...
-[Colt sniggers]

17:21.373 --> 17:23.292
-[Abby wails]
-[Colt] This isn't happening!

17:23.584 --> 17:25.335
[Peyton cries]

17:25.961 --> 17:27.171
-[Colt groans]
-[Peyton cries]

17:28.005 --> 17:29.006
[Colt] Okay.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.258
All right. Fuck it.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.343
I'm sleeping...

17:34.136 --> 17:35.804
I'm gonna go sleep in Rooster's room.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.556
I'm sorry, what?

17:37.848 --> 17:38.932
[Peyton cries]

17:39.516 --> 17:41.810
Babe, I gotta sleep.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.228
-And I don't?
-[Peyton still cries]

17:44.271 --> 17:46.190
I've been workin' on the ranch
all day today.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.983
I gotta do the same thing tomorrow.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.110
Okay, work on the ranch ends at sundown.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.237
-Taking care of a baby never ends.
-[Peyton cries]

17:52.863 --> 17:55.699
I haven't showered
since we got home from the hospital.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.660
All I've been doin'
is feeding her non-stop.

17:58.744 --> 18:01.538
I'm smelly and stinky.
I'm like a 24-Hour IHOP.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.040
-[Peyton cries]
-[Abby] Shh.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.126
Fine, I'll do both our jobs.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.545
Oh, so raising our child is <i>my</i> job?

18:08.629 --> 18:10.339
You know what?
Go sleep in Rooster's room.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.424
-Give me the kid.
-No, it's fine, it's my job.

18:12.508 --> 18:13.759
-Give her to me.
-No.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.803
-Give me. The kid.
-[Peyton cries]

18:15.886 --> 18:16.804
Fine.

18:17.554 --> 18:19.556
[Peyton still cries]

18:21.225 --> 18:22.226
Thank you.

18:24.728 --> 18:26.438
[Peyton cries louder]

18:33.362 --> 18:34.613
I see what you did.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.616
And it's not fair
'cause you're smarter than me.

18:45.082 --> 18:46.792
-Oh, hey, Heather.
-Hey, Maggie.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.128
I just came to pick up
my mom's last paycheck.

18:49.670 --> 18:50.629
Sure.

18:50.712 --> 18:52.965
God, I wish that was the first time
I've ever said that.

18:54.508 --> 18:55.342
There you go.

18:56.343 --> 19:00.347
So, she said she got fired
but that she didn't wanna talk about it.

19:00.430 --> 19:02.808
So what happened?
She slap a customer or somethin'?

19:04.476 --> 19:08.522
No. If I had to fire everyone that slapped
a customer, even I couldn't work here.

19:10.899 --> 19:14.987
Look, if she didn't wanna tell you,
I don't think it's my place to.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.614
She just really needs this job.

19:18.282 --> 19:21.869
After her last DUI, I don't think they'll
let her go back to driving school buses.

19:23.745 --> 19:26.039
Is there any way
you can see her working here again?

19:26.874 --> 19:29.501
I'm really sorry
for the situation you're in, but...

19:30.294 --> 19:31.545
your mom needs help,

19:32.171 --> 19:35.007
and I can't make her problems
my problems right now.

19:36.091 --> 19:38.093
You take care of yourself,
all right, honey?

19:38.760 --> 19:39.887
I understand.

19:40.596 --> 19:41.471
Thanks, Maggie.

19:47.644 --> 19:48.687
Hey, Heather.

19:48.770 --> 19:49.897
Hey, Colt.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.442
Oh my God... [laughs nervously]
...is this your daughter?

19:53.525 --> 19:54.526
[Colt] Yeah.

19:55.527 --> 19:56.612
That's Peyton.

19:57.487 --> 19:58.655
She's beautiful.

20:00.032 --> 20:00.949
Thank you.

20:02.659 --> 20:04.703
All right, well, I gotta get goin'.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.496
Congratulations, Colt.

20:07.956 --> 20:09.291
We'll see you.

20:13.503 --> 20:14.671
Hey, Mom.

20:14.755 --> 20:15.756
Hey.

20:15.839 --> 20:17.883
What's Heather doin' here?

20:18.467 --> 20:20.594
Oh, just some stuff with Mary.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.555
Yeah, it got pretty awkward.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.268
Don't beat yourself up.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.771
We got a business to run here.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.109
-Where's my little angel?
-[Colt] Here.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.819
Oh, she's sleeping.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.404
She's a demon child.

20:40.989 --> 20:44.534
Couldn't get her to stop cryin', so I put
her in the truck, took her for a drive.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.828
She finally fell asleep.
Realized I was here.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.748
D'you mind if I take a nap
in the Airstream?

20:50.832 --> 20:53.210
Apparently, that's frowned upon.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.923
She ever gonna grow out
of this cryin' phase?

20:58.006 --> 20:59.591
Well, you haven't.

21:01.593 --> 21:05.264
Last week we watched <i>Fast and Furious 6.</i>
You went through two boxes of Kleenex.

21:06.848 --> 21:08.767
Come on,
you're just a monster if you don't cry

21:08.850 --> 21:11.728
when Dominic Toretto says,
"It's all about the family."

21:14.731 --> 21:15.857
So, er...

21:17.359 --> 21:18.735
everythin' okay with Mary?

21:19.861 --> 21:21.238
Without going into details,

21:21.321 --> 21:22.447
it's a whole mess.

21:23.073 --> 21:25.200
I really counted on her
and she let me down.

21:26.576 --> 21:29.663
Yeah, maybe she's got
some other stuff goin' on.

21:30.789 --> 21:33.083
Everybody's got other stuff goin' on.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.627
You have to decide
what's important to you.

21:36.545 --> 21:39.881
Okay, but sometimes you got other stuff
goin' on that's of equal importance.

21:40.507 --> 21:42.301
Other people don't see that.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.886
In fact, just 'cause you spend more time
with this bar

21:44.970 --> 21:47.556
doesn't mean that you love it
any more than she does.

21:49.099 --> 21:51.059
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

21:54.229 --> 21:56.648
Look, I'm just sayin',

21:56.732 --> 22:00.444
maybe Mary didn't know
how hard it was gonna be to have a bar.

22:01.862 --> 22:03.030
It's loud.

22:04.364 --> 22:07.117
It's overwhelming,
and there's pee all over the place.

22:09.870 --> 22:12.622
Look, maybe what you need to do
to get the help you want

22:12.706 --> 22:15.250
is every once in a while,
let her take a fuckin' nap.

22:18.628 --> 22:21.173
Mary stole from me
and she has a drug problem.

22:21.965 --> 22:24.051
Oh, shit. Yeah, fuckin' fire her.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.473
[slow country music plays softly
in background]

22:36.021 --> 22:37.105
Hey, Luke.

22:38.231 --> 22:39.107
Hey.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.109
How'd you find me?

22:41.860 --> 22:43.862
Well, I knew you were in the campground.

22:44.821 --> 22:46.615
I just asked around,

22:46.698 --> 22:49.284
see if anybody'd seen a guy
with this on his head.

22:52.329 --> 22:53.997
My hat was a Coors box.

22:57.709 --> 22:58.710
Mind if I sit?

22:59.795 --> 23:01.254
Please, pull up a cooler.

23:02.547 --> 23:04.132
Don't have much to offer you.

23:04.925 --> 23:08.345
About to pan-fry some bass
crusted in Cool Ranch Doritos.

23:09.346 --> 23:12.516
Well, you can crust it in whatever
you want, it's still a fuckin' fish.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.437
Listen, about earlier...

23:18.397 --> 23:20.190
I'm sorry I snapped like that.

23:20.857 --> 23:21.858
It's okay.

23:23.985 --> 23:25.028
That happen a lot?

23:27.739 --> 23:28.949
Yeah, from...

23:29.032 --> 23:32.494
time to time, y'know,
a noise'll catch me by surprise.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.579
And I overreact.

23:35.872 --> 23:36.832
I'm guessin' it...

23:37.374 --> 23:39.751
started after you came back from Iraq.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.256
Well, it didn't happen before Iraq.

23:45.715 --> 23:47.050
Gettin' any help?

23:48.927 --> 23:50.929
Been to a couple VA hospitals.

23:51.888 --> 23:53.682
Think they mean well, but...

23:53.765 --> 23:56.435
I don't want to insult you
if you're pro big government programs.

23:56.518 --> 23:57.978
Please continue.

23:59.980 --> 24:00.981
Well...

24:01.690 --> 24:04.192
Yeah, I got buried
under a mountain of red tape there,

24:04.276 --> 24:05.694
so, I bailed.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.989
So you're dealin' with this on your own?

24:09.614 --> 24:12.617
Yeah, yeah, but I'm... I'm okay.

24:14.536 --> 24:16.872
I think this move to California
will be helpful.

24:18.790 --> 24:20.375
This stuff never goes away.

24:22.377 --> 24:24.921
For me, it's the smell of diesel fuel.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.633
It was everywhere in Vietnam.

24:30.260 --> 24:33.472
Every time I fill up a tractor
it just takes me right back.

24:38.101 --> 24:39.186
[quietly] Vietnam.

24:39.811 --> 24:40.687
That was...

24:41.855 --> 24:43.190
That was a tough war.

24:43.773 --> 24:45.317
Son, they're all tough.

24:48.403 --> 24:49.279
[Luke] Yeah.

24:50.739 --> 24:51.656
I'm stupid.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.868
I thought I was gonna be
jumpin' outta airplanes,

24:55.494 --> 24:57.162
stickin' flags in the ground.

24:58.455 --> 25:02.626
Instead, I'm driving a fuckin'
Humvee through Fallujah.

25:04.085 --> 25:06.046
Six of my guys in back and...

25:07.714 --> 25:11.551
this little kid runs out, waving his hands
like something's the matter.

25:12.552 --> 25:14.095
We stop, try to help.

25:14.179 --> 25:16.848
I'm just...
Right as I'm lookin' in his eyes,

25:16.932 --> 25:19.643
IEDs just start fuckin' blowing up
left and right.

25:19.726 --> 25:22.020
RPGs are coming off the rooftops.

25:22.604 --> 25:26.608
You know, snipers with high-caliber rounds
coming through the Humvee...

25:28.401 --> 25:30.403
Two guys were smoked just like that.

25:32.614 --> 25:35.659
And then it's just <i>fuckin'</i> chaos,
y'know? It's...

25:37.118 --> 25:38.703
rounds ricocheting...

25:39.996 --> 25:42.707
broken glass, screaming, blood...

25:46.086 --> 25:48.547
Took forever for the convoy
to show up and...

25:49.965 --> 25:51.216
get us outta there.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.468
It was...

25:55.220 --> 25:57.472
Me and one other guy,
that was all that was left.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.848
Whole thing just...

25:58.932 --> 26:00.058
evaporated.

26:04.062 --> 26:05.272
I'm so sorry.

26:06.856 --> 26:08.984
That's not even the worst part, y'know?

26:09.067 --> 26:11.278
They force you to adapt to their tactics.

26:12.070 --> 26:15.365
If they're gonna block the roads
with little kids so they can ambush us...

26:16.658 --> 26:17.701
we can't stop.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.581
You gotta run through 'em.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.794
Sweet Jesus.

26:34.676 --> 26:36.219
Why don't you stay with us?

26:38.555 --> 26:40.473
We can always use an extra hand.

26:41.641 --> 26:43.059
Might do you some good.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.441
I appreciate that, Beau, but...

26:50.900 --> 26:53.069
I just stopped by
to see where I came from.

26:54.738 --> 26:56.948
Not tryin' to put my problems
on you guys.

26:58.867 --> 27:00.535
You're my brother's son.

27:02.329 --> 27:03.955
I'd do anythin' for him.

27:06.666 --> 27:07.834
It's up to you, but...

27:09.878 --> 27:11.546
Hope you'll consider it.

27:30.774 --> 27:31.608
[phone takes photo]

27:34.611 --> 27:35.570
[whispers] Hey.

27:37.405 --> 27:38.782
-Hey.
-Hi.

27:41.159 --> 27:42.869
[whispers] I woke up and you were gone.

27:43.870 --> 27:44.829
[whispers] Yeah, erm...

27:47.707 --> 27:48.708
We came upstairs.

27:49.292 --> 27:50.168
Yeah.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.379
And you were sleepin',

27:52.462 --> 27:53.838
-so peacefully.
-[laughs softly]

27:55.590 --> 27:56.508
Well...

27:58.134 --> 28:01.054
you were snorin' and droolin'
like Hank at last call but...

28:03.390 --> 28:04.683
it was cute.

28:04.766 --> 28:06.142
I didn't wanna wake you up.

28:06.226 --> 28:07.352
Oh...

28:07.435 --> 28:08.645
thank you.

28:08.728 --> 28:09.854
That's so sweet.

28:13.024 --> 28:14.442
She hasn't been fussin'?

28:15.527 --> 28:18.238
-Er, she got a little fussy earlier.
-Hm.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.115
Changed her diaper.

28:21.199 --> 28:23.243
Laid her down here
and she fell asleep on my chest.

28:23.326 --> 28:24.285
Yeah.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.121
-[Peyton gurgles softly]
-Listen.

28:26.913 --> 28:29.708
I can't take all the credit.
I put on a video...

28:29.791 --> 28:32.210
my dad shot of me
playin' in high school.

28:32.293 --> 28:33.128
[Abby chuckles]

28:34.170 --> 28:36.756
God. You fell asleep to that?

28:36.840 --> 28:39.926
I mean, to be fair,
it's like two and a half hours of

28:40.552 --> 28:43.012
feet, occasional cheerin',

28:43.763 --> 28:44.848
and a whole lotta...

28:45.724 --> 28:48.351
[impersonates Beau]
"Does the red light mean it's on or off?"

28:54.441 --> 28:55.942
Means a lot that you did this.

28:57.610 --> 28:59.154
I know how hard you been working.

28:59.237 --> 29:00.238
Okay?

29:02.741 --> 29:04.868
-You been working hard, too.
-Well...

29:05.493 --> 29:06.619
Harder than me.

29:08.413 --> 29:11.166
-[Peyton gurgles]
-Didn't mean to put you in that position.

29:13.376 --> 29:15.086
I don't wanna be that kinda dad.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.506
I don't wanna miss moments like...

29:18.840 --> 29:19.966
[Peyton gurgles]

29:20.341 --> 29:21.885
-...this.
-[Abby and Colt chuckle]

29:24.846 --> 29:25.805
Yeah.

29:26.556 --> 29:29.100
Earlier, Peyton smiled at me.

29:30.393 --> 29:31.478
It was...

29:32.228 --> 29:33.688
the cutest smile.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.566
I know she was passing gas, but still...

29:38.943 --> 29:40.779
I've never been that kinda happy.

29:43.198 --> 29:45.366
Just want you to know
you can always count on me.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.873
Bennett, you're the best teammate
I could ever have.

29:53.082 --> 29:55.126
-Ain't nobody ever said that to me before.
-[sniggers]

29:56.127 --> 29:57.712
-You don't have to bullshit me.
-[laughs]

29:59.047 --> 30:01.007
-Sorry about that, Peyt.
-Yeah.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.675
Earmuffs. [laughs]

30:03.510 --> 30:05.637
You don't have to get up
for a couple hours, so...

30:06.596 --> 30:08.681
-why don't I take her and you sleep.
-No.

30:09.849 --> 30:10.850
I have a better idea.

30:12.393 --> 30:14.395
Lay here, sleep as a family.

30:14.687 --> 30:16.105
[Abby] Oh. Yeah.

30:18.900 --> 30:19.943
[Colt] There we go.

30:20.568 --> 30:22.737
[Abby groans contentedly] This is nice.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.072
-This is the best.
-Mmm.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.826
Oh, I owe you for this.

30:28.785 --> 30:29.828
Oh, actually...

30:30.662 --> 30:34.874
I hide my fancy peach-pit body scrub
in the back of the linen closet.

30:36.751 --> 30:37.669
-Thank you.
-Mm-hm.

30:38.795 --> 30:39.796
That's...

30:40.421 --> 30:43.299
very well hidden,
I will use it for the very first time.

30:44.717 --> 30:46.719
[Abby chuckles]

30:47.220 --> 30:48.179
Love you.

30:49.514 --> 30:50.598
I love you.

30:53.142 --> 30:54.936
You really do need to take a shower.

30:55.019 --> 30:57.146
[Abby, chuckling] I know. It's bad.

31:03.945 --> 31:05.947
[car approaches]

31:10.827 --> 31:11.703
Mornin', Luke.

31:13.413 --> 31:14.330
Good to see you.

31:14.914 --> 31:16.040
You, too.

31:16.124 --> 31:17.125
Hey, I...

31:17.375 --> 31:19.586
I appreciate you coming out
to see me last night.

31:20.795 --> 31:23.548
As a thank you, I got you a jet kit
for your carburetor.

31:24.215 --> 31:26.801
It was either that or flowers,
and something about your personality

31:26.885 --> 31:28.511
doesn't scream roses.

31:30.179 --> 31:33.391
Maybe you can tell Colt about that
before Father's Day.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.896
If that offer's still good,
I'd like to stay a little while.

31:39.272 --> 31:41.107
Really glad to hear that, son.

31:42.817 --> 31:45.778
Let's get started on that carburetor.
I'll grab the keys.

31:45.862 --> 31:48.364
All right, if I'm gonna be stayin' here,
I wanna help out.

31:49.407 --> 31:51.951
Maybe you can tell Colt
about that idea, too.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.082
Hey, Pop Pop.

31:59.042 --> 32:00.919
What a beautiful mornin', huh?

32:01.002 --> 32:02.253
You're in a chipper mood.

32:02.337 --> 32:05.340
Yeah, well, I slept
for an hour and 43 minutes.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.467
[in high voice] I feel fuckin' fantastic.

32:08.301 --> 32:11.012
Plus, I put two five-hour energy
drinks in my coffee this morning

32:11.095 --> 32:14.057
so after I finish up on the ranch
I'm gonna go frame out the Peterson place

32:14.140 --> 32:17.060
and then put on the YouTubes
and teach Peyton how to play guit... ar.

32:18.811 --> 32:20.313
Let me finish.

32:20.396 --> 32:22.398
You're in a chipper mood and I hate it.

32:23.691 --> 32:24.651
Figures.

32:29.697 --> 32:30.823
What's Luke doing here?

32:30.907 --> 32:34.619
I invited him to stay with us for a while
while he figures some things out.

32:35.370 --> 32:36.371
You kiddin' me?

32:37.664 --> 32:38.706
He can't stay here.

32:39.457 --> 32:40.500
Guy's unstable.

32:42.210 --> 32:44.045
He's got some issues
he's workin' on but...

32:44.712 --> 32:45.922
I think it'll be good for him.

32:46.005 --> 32:47.840
I don't give a shit about his issues.

32:48.633 --> 32:51.094
I've got my wife,
my newborn in this house.

32:51.844 --> 32:53.680
I don't want that guy anywhere near them.

32:53.763 --> 32:56.849
He's family, Colt.
He can stay in the hunting cabin.

32:56.933 --> 32:58.726
The hunting--? Fuck that!

32:58.810 --> 33:00.186
That's Rooster's!

33:00.979 --> 33:03.731
No, I don't want this guy
anywhere on this ranch.

33:05.108 --> 33:06.693
Good thing it's not your ranch.
