CHRIS ROCK:
In my house,
the most important holiday

00:03.804 --> 00:05.606
of the year was Mother's Day.

00:05.639 --> 00:06.740
You'd think
it would be Christmas,

00:06.774 --> 00:08.442
and it might have been

00:08.476 --> 00:10.778
if Jesus cleaned our house
and cooked our meals.

00:10.811 --> 00:13.747
Oh, wow!
That smells good.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.317
Who wants meat loaf?

00:16.350 --> 00:18.452
Have you thought about what
you want for Mother's Day, Mom?

00:18.486 --> 00:21.755
Well, you kids cleaning up
the house, that would be nice.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.824
We tried that when
you sprained your shoulder.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.526
Remember? It didn't go too well.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.228
It went well for you, lazy.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.797
Hey, Dad, what you
getting Mom for Mother's Day?

00:29.830 --> 00:31.665
Me

00:31.699 --> 00:33.601
It's Mother's Day,
not Wife's Day.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.236
What?

00:35.269 --> 00:37.771
Um... maybe some flowers.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.173
I wanted to get my mother
something nice,

00:39.207 --> 00:42.676
because all I could think of
was how much she sacrificed.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.112
She sacrificed at home.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.280
Okay, who wants pizza?!

00:49.250 --> 00:51.385
And she sacrificed
in the streets.

00:51.419 --> 00:52.420
Thanks for your coat, Mama.

00:52.453 --> 00:55.523
That's okay, baby.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.826
I... I like the cold.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.261
You know what, you guys?

01:00.294 --> 01:01.729
You don't have
to get me anything.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.564
You give me such
great gifts every year.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.466
No, we don't.

01:05.499 --> 01:07.635
We just make you some
stupid gift out of macaroni.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.737
My macaroni oven mitts
were not stupid.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.572
Yeah, you're right.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.341
They weren't nearly as stupid
as your macaroni hot comb.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.308
Shut up.

01:14.342 --> 01:16.210
Or your macaroni macaroni bowl.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.478
TONYA:
Hey, you shut up, too.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.680
CHRIS:
Get out of my
voice-over booth, woman.

01:19.713 --> 01:22.183
Save that for the show
Everybody Hates Tonya.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.617
TONYA:
Whatever.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.386
Okay, fine.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.155
You know what I really want?

01:27.188 --> 01:28.088
I want that.

01:28.122 --> 01:31.292
TV ANNOUNCER:
...comes a sensual power.

01:31.325 --> 01:34.862
Pour it on,
and let its rich aroma

01:34.895 --> 01:37.298
bathe and soothe your senses,

01:37.331 --> 01:39.900
engulf you with the memory
of youth.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.470
Explosive.

01:42.503 --> 01:46.307
WOMAN:
Available exclusively
at Goldstein's Department Store.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.842
You want some doves?

01:48.876 --> 01:50.778
I think she wants angel wings.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.346
No, no, no. She wants champagne.

01:52.380 --> 01:53.681
An exploding chandelier?

01:53.714 --> 01:56.884
No, you guys.
I want Pure Voodoo!

01:56.917 --> 01:58.786
ALL:
Oh!

01:58.819 --> 02:00.488
CHRIS:
That stuff looks expensive.

02:00.521 --> 02:01.889
Well, you asked me
what I wanted.

02:01.922 --> 02:05.293
I knew right then I had to get
that perfume for Mother's Day.

02:05.326 --> 02:08.262
I was just glad it wasn't
a commercial for a Cadillac.

02:16.270 --> 02:19.407
* Ah, make it funky now.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.730
Hey, check out what I made
for my mom for Mother's Day.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.932
Macaroni pajamas.

02:44.965 --> 02:45.966
Don't you think
you're a little bit too old

02:45.999 --> 02:47.635
to be making macaroni presents?

02:47.668 --> 02:48.769
When Greg got engaged,

02:48.802 --> 02:51.372
he gave his fiancÃ©e
a piece of rigatoni.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.673
So what are you getting your mom
for Mother's Day?

02:52.706 --> 02:54.208
Oh. Pure Voodoo.

02:54.242 --> 02:54.842
Isn't that stuff expensive?

02:54.875 --> 02:56.644
It's only, like, 40 bucks.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.846
40 bucks!
You can buy a car with that.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.948
Actually, in my neighborhood,
you could.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.457
I'll sell you this car
for 40 bucks.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.724
50!

03:10.758 --> 03:12.493
:
Sold.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.830
That's a lot of money.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.532
Yeah, but my mom's
really worth it.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.534
I mean, she works,
she cooks, she cleans.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.902
And what do I
ever do for her?

03:21.935 --> 03:23.271
Besides, I think
it's finally time

03:23.304 --> 03:24.838
to show her how
appreciative I am.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.640
I hope my mom
appreciates my gift.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.476
Now I just have to figure out
what cell block she's on.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.611
Did you try Bellevue?

03:30.644 --> 03:33.947
While I was planning
my expensive surprise,

03:33.981 --> 03:36.750
Tonya was finding the cheapest
Mother's Day gift ever.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.919
Daddy... Mama...

03:38.952 --> 03:41.855
"The Columbian Record
and Tape Club"?

03:41.889 --> 03:43.657
"Resident"?

03:43.691 --> 03:44.958
In our house,
everybody was allowed

03:44.992 --> 03:48.462
to open mail addressed
to "Resident."

03:48.496 --> 03:50.864
Eight records for one penny?

03:50.898 --> 03:53.934
I can get Mama a present,
and myself something, too.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.869
Aw, this is nice.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.438
Meanwhile, Drew was looking

03:57.471 --> 03:58.939
to turn old junk
into a new present.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.574
What's all this, Drew?

04:00.608 --> 04:01.709
I'm gonna sell some stuff

04:01.742 --> 04:03.644
so I can get some extra money
to buy Mom's present.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.546
I thought you
had money saved up.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.382
I did, but that was my
"running of the bulls" money.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.850
Duh!
Drew, this stuff is junk.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.852
What is this, anyway?

04:11.885 --> 04:12.853
That's my Voltron.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.823
Voltron? Well, put it
on the six-month rule.

04:15.856 --> 04:16.890
What's that?

04:16.924 --> 04:18.225
If you haven't used it
in six months, get rid of it.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.828
If that was the case, he'd have
to get rid of all his money.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.830
After you get
this stuff cleaned up,

04:22.863 --> 04:24.665
I'll give you
five dollars.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.600
Cool!

04:29.370 --> 04:31.439
The problem with going
to department stores

04:31.472 --> 04:33.374
is every time
a black person enters,

04:33.407 --> 04:34.742
they get followed.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.878
It didn't matter if you were
a baby wearing diapers...

04:37.911 --> 04:39.580
She's on the move.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.849
...or a senior citizen
wearing diapers.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.017
She's on the roll.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.855
Or even one of their own.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.657
He's on the move.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.761
What do you mean,
I'm on the move?

04:53.794 --> 04:54.728
I work here.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.797
Sorry.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.499
Force of habit.

04:58.532 --> 05:02.436
What's wrong with you, man?

05:03.671 --> 05:04.838
Ah. May I help you?

05:04.872 --> 05:07.475
Yes. I'm here to buy
the Pure Voodoo
for Mother's Day.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.610
The eau de toilette
or the perfume?

05:09.643 --> 05:10.744
Which one is $40?

05:10.778 --> 05:12.112
The eau de toilette.
I'll take it.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.081
Sorry. We're all out.
She did that on purpose.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.215
It's Mother's Day.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.351
You want to buy something cheap,
you have to start early.

05:17.385 --> 05:20.354
Okay. What about that bottle?

05:20.388 --> 05:21.989
Oh, that's not eau de toilette.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.925
This is the Pure Voodoo perfume.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.627
What's the difference?

05:26.660 --> 05:29.530
The perfume contains up
to 20% more aromatic compounds

05:29.563 --> 05:30.864
than the eau de toilette,

05:30.898 --> 05:33.801
and is classified
by olfactive family,

05:33.834 --> 05:37.137
though it does not exist
as a true, singular
aromatic material,

05:37.170 --> 05:39.773
whereas the eau de toilette
contains up to five to ten...

05:39.807 --> 05:41.509
You can see the rest
of this 20-minute speech

05:41.542 --> 05:43.677
over at PerfumeNut.net.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.078
But here's the important part:

05:45.112 --> 05:46.079
How much is it?

05:46.113 --> 05:48.882
$180.
$180?

05:48.916 --> 05:50.017
I'm assuming
you don't have that.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.486
No!
Excuse me.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.154
Mother's Day was two days away,

05:54.187 --> 05:56.424
and I was up the creek
without a present.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.125
But I knew my mother
would understand.

05:58.158 --> 06:04.965
* I want one moment in time...

06:04.998 --> 06:06.467
Or maybe not.

06:06.500 --> 06:10.671
* When I'm more than
I thought I could be... *

06:10.704 --> 06:13.106
My mother had done things
for me she didn't want to do,

06:13.140 --> 06:15.643
so I figured it was time
I return the favor.

06:15.676 --> 06:19.046
* ...a heartbeat away,
and the answers... *

06:19.079 --> 06:20.147
Of course, my mother
didn't do anything

06:20.180 --> 06:22.483
that would get her locked up.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.686
* Give me one moment
in time... *

06:25.719 --> 06:26.954
Hold it right
there, son.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.722
Situation in Cosmetics.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.858
Either he really thought
I was his son,

06:30.891 --> 06:33.561
or I was in big trouble.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.833
Choosing to shoplift was the
worst decision I had ever made.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.635
Even a Turkish prison
would be nice

06:41.669 --> 06:43.671
compared to what
my mother would do

06:43.704 --> 06:45.906
if she found out I stole.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.144
ROCHELLE:
Chris!

06:51.178 --> 06:52.746
Boy, where you at?!

06:52.780 --> 06:54.515
My mother's coming! Kill me now!

06:54.548 --> 06:55.849
Kill me now!

06:55.883 --> 06:57.785
Kill me now!

06:57.818 --> 07:00.053
Well, I might be able to keep
you from going to jail

07:00.087 --> 07:02.890
if you tell me what else
you've stolen from our store.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.493
Nothing. I swear,
I've never stolen anything else

07:05.526 --> 07:07.561
from this store
or anywhere else in my life.

07:07.595 --> 07:08.629
Oh, really?

07:08.662 --> 07:11.632
Are you telling me
this isn't you in this picture?

07:11.665 --> 07:13.901
No. That's Lionel Ritchie.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.936
Looks like you to me.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.805
He wouldn't know Lionel Ritchie
from Lionel Jefferson.

07:17.838 --> 07:20.908
Sir, please. I'm not a criminal.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.076
Not a successful one, anyway.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.547
Okay, I admit I was thinking
about taking the perfume.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.181
I just wanted to get
something nice for my mother.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.150
Then I realized
how stupid it was,

07:30.183 --> 07:31.919
and was I about to put it back.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.754
I'm sorry.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.793
All right, I'll tell you
what I'm going to do.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.562
Instead of sending you to jail,

07:41.595 --> 07:43.931
I'm going to put your picture
up on our Wall of Shame.

07:43.964 --> 07:44.898
What's that?

07:44.932 --> 07:47.668
All these people have either

07:47.701 --> 07:50.804
shoplifted,
passed bad checks,

07:50.838 --> 07:53.874
or are named Kill Moves.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.744
Now, say, "Cheese."

07:56.777 --> 07:58.712
Cheese?

07:58.746 --> 08:02.883
We have a two-strike policy
here at Goldstein's.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.919
If we catch you here again,
that is strike two,

08:05.953 --> 08:07.788
and you go to jail.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.623
Goldstein's was ahead
of its time,

08:09.657 --> 08:11.792
but one strike short.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.962
I looked like a senator
caught in a bathroom.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.832
What are you doing?

08:18.866 --> 08:21.635
Trying to figure out
what to buy Mom
for Mother's Day.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.203
I know what I'm getting her.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.105
And it's barely
costing me anything.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.674
What? A paper bag for your head,

08:26.707 --> 08:28.642
so she won't have
to see your ugly face?

08:28.676 --> 08:32.079
No. And, just for that,
I'm not telling you what it is.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.882
MAN :
What have we got next
on the table, Donnie?

08:34.915 --> 08:38.586
Holy cow, Lonnie!
I don't believe my eyes.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.320
It's a V-V-V-Voltron!

08:40.353 --> 08:42.189
Hey, don't you
have one of those?

08:42.222 --> 08:44.191
I did, but Dad made
me get rid of it.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.627
These guys are stupid.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.895
A Voltron's not
worth anything.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.830
They were less than $20.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.164
But, due to high demand
and limited supply...

08:51.198 --> 08:53.066
These babies
can be worth

08:53.100 --> 08:55.135
up to $150!

08:55.168 --> 08:57.204
What's worth $150!

08:57.237 --> 08:59.973
He looks like that guy
that lives next door.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.742
He was fabulous.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.844
Back at school,
I was out of hot water,

09:03.877 --> 09:05.846
but Greg thought it was cool.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.715
I can't believe you
almost got arrested.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.116
You're gonna get
so much street cred.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.251
I don't need street cred;
I need a Mother's Day gift.

09:11.284 --> 09:12.686
Well, it's
not too late

09:12.720 --> 09:14.321
to still make her
something out of macaroni.

09:14.354 --> 09:17.124
Hey. You're
that black kid.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.726
Yeah. Where did you come from?

09:18.759 --> 09:21.161
Brooklyn. By way of Palermo.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.230
Anyway, I overheard
your conversation.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.331
You need a Mother's Day gift?

09:24.364 --> 09:25.699
Yeah. I'm looking
for Pure Voodoo.

09:25.733 --> 09:29.036
Ooh! There goes
the college fund, huh?

09:29.069 --> 09:31.038
But I got a guy can help you.

09:31.071 --> 09:31.805
Really?

09:31.839 --> 09:33.306
Yeah. Five bucks.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.709
Wait. He has the perfume
for five dollars?

09:35.743 --> 09:36.877
No.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.679
It's five bucks for the info.

09:38.712 --> 09:42.049
Oh. Well, better be good.

09:42.082 --> 09:46.219
Yeah, see, the only thing is
he lives in a really,

09:46.253 --> 09:48.789
really bad neighborhood.

09:48.822 --> 09:51.024
I don't even dare
go there myself.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.025
Where is that?

09:52.059 --> 09:53.360
Bed Stuy.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.365
Are you telling me
I just paid you five dollars

09:58.398 --> 10:00.868
so that you could tell me
to go see Risky?

10:00.901 --> 10:05.405
So I guess I'm not
gonna get another five

10:05.438 --> 10:07.675
out of you for the directions.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.312
Oh, yeah, I got the latest
designer imposter perfumes.

10:12.345 --> 10:15.749
Yeah. I've got
Chanel No. 45.

10:15.783 --> 10:16.984
Huh?

10:17.017 --> 10:20.353
Calvin Klein's Depression,
Revlon's Chucky...

10:20.387 --> 10:21.722
Do you have Pure Voodoo?

10:21.755 --> 10:23.891
Do I have Pure Voodoo?

10:23.924 --> 10:25.826
Look at that. Pah-dow!

10:25.859 --> 10:29.062
Wow, does this smell
like the original?

10:29.096 --> 10:33.000
Same smell, same
bottle, same box.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.935
An exact replica right
down to the letter.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.336
And it's only $20.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.906
Great. I'll take it.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.709
Yo, for five dollars extra,

10:41.742 --> 10:43.944
you can get this Ewing
cologne for Father's Day.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.880
Hmm? It's the official
scent of Patrick Ewing.

10:46.914 --> 10:48.315
Before or after the game?

10:48.348 --> 10:49.717
No thanks.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.857
While I was making
a fake purchase,

10:56.890 --> 10:59.727
Drew and my dad were on the
hunt for their pot of gold.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.961
After we get
the Voltron back,

11:00.994 --> 11:03.096
maybe I can find a
gift for Mom in here.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.364
Good idea.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.399
'Cause everything
in here is dirt cheap.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.467
Can I help you?

11:07.500 --> 11:08.468
What are these?

11:08.501 --> 11:09.737
Shoulder pads.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.238
Aw. This is fantastic!

11:11.271 --> 11:12.372
Mom will love it.

11:12.405 --> 11:13.907
She will?

11:13.941 --> 11:15.475
She's your mother,
not Lawrence Taylor.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.078
Yeah. How much?
One dollar.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.179
Sold.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.214
Wow, that's cheap.

11:21.248 --> 11:23.316
Maybe I can find something
to put the flowers in.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.786
Oh, I have this...
: vase.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.154
Is that anything like a vase?

11:27.187 --> 11:28.188
That's nice.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.023
How much?
$50.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.825
$50?
Yeah.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.994
You see, people
throw stuff away--

11:34.027 --> 11:36.730
they have no idea
that it's valuable.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.031
They're stupid.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.800
Speaking of which--

11:39.833 --> 11:41.902
we came here to buy
that Voltron action figure

11:41.935 --> 11:43.303
we dropped off
the other day.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.471
Yeah, it's worth
a lot of...

11:44.504 --> 11:45.773
Memories.

11:45.806 --> 11:46.774
It's worth a lot

11:46.807 --> 11:48.341
of memories to my boy.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.210
Yeah, 150 of them.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.179
Even though it's
totally worthless,
right, son?

11:52.212 --> 11:53.881
Right, Dad.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.949
Oh, it's not here.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.951
Everything that gets
dropped off,

11:57.985 --> 12:00.353
goes to the defumigation unit
first.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.055
You cannot believe
how nasty

12:02.089 --> 12:04.792
some of the stuff is
people give us.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.094
Voltron hadn't taken
a shower in years.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.796
Are you going to be
getting it back?

12:08.829 --> 12:10.363
Well, after things
get cleaned,

12:10.397 --> 12:12.132
they get sorted, logged

12:12.165 --> 12:13.233
and distributed.

12:13.266 --> 12:18.005
It'll either be here or at one
of our other stores.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.873
You could check back
in a couple of days.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.844
One dollar.

12:23.877 --> 12:24.978
Thank you.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.847
Do you take coupons?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.050
My father was getting
the blues,

12:30.083 --> 12:32.452
but Tonya was singing
a whole different tune.

12:32.485 --> 12:35.122
Billy Ocean Unplugged
for me.

12:36.924 --> 12:39.759
Billy Ocean Filipino Queen
for me...

12:41.862 --> 12:45.098
Billy Ocean Live at the
Pacific Ocean for moi...

12:47.500 --> 12:49.970
Patti LaBelle for Mama.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.307
And more Billy Ocean
for me.

12:54.341 --> 12:57.310
On Mother's Day, all I could do
was hope my mother

12:57.344 --> 12:59.546
didn't know the difference
between Pure Voodoo

12:59.579 --> 13:01.414
and Pure Voo-don't.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.084
ALL:
Happy Mother's Day!

13:04.117 --> 13:05.418
Thank you-- ooh!

13:05.452 --> 13:07.420
This vase is beautiful.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.922
You deserve it.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.057
Jules, you paid

13:10.090 --> 13:11.892
$50 for this vase?

13:11.925 --> 13:14.061
I'm sorry. I meant
to take that off.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.863
No, he didn't.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.998
Ma, here's my present.
Patti LaBelle.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.000
Oh, Patti LaBelle!

13:20.033 --> 13:24.437
Tonya, you shouldn't have
spent this much money on me.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.473
She didn't spend a dime,
literally.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.275
Happy Mother's Day, Ma.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.844
Oh, Drew, what did
you get Mommy?

13:30.878 --> 13:33.313
Shoulder pads!

13:33.346 --> 13:35.248
This is just
what I wanted.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.917
Oh, baby.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.318
This is such a
wonderful gift.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.321
Told you.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.589
Here you go, Ma.

13:42.622 --> 13:45.425
Oh, thank you, Chris.

13:47.094 --> 13:49.196
But this is...!
Fake.

13:49.229 --> 13:50.998
Pure Voodoo!

13:51.031 --> 13:52.299
I know.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.400
Oh, my God!

13:53.433 --> 13:54.401
You're kidding me!

13:54.434 --> 13:56.203
But where

13:56.236 --> 13:59.239
I saved and saved and saved
and bought it at Goldstein's.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.074
Actually I lied
and lied and lied

14:01.108 --> 14:03.010
and bought it from Risky.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.611
But this is the perfume.

14:04.644 --> 14:07.547
Yeah, I figured
you deserved the best.

14:07.580 --> 14:11.051
Oh, baby,
this is wonderful!

14:11.084 --> 14:12.886
You know what?

14:12.920 --> 14:14.287
I'm going to listen
to my album,

14:14.321 --> 14:15.222
I'm going to look

14:15.255 --> 14:18.325
at my flowers in their
very expensive vase,

14:18.358 --> 14:21.128
I'm going to find
an outfit to wear
with my shoulder pads

14:21.161 --> 14:24.397
and I'm going to sniff
on my Pure Voodoo!

14:24.431 --> 14:25.632
Mm, mm, mm.

14:25.665 --> 14:27.467
Seeing my mom that happy
made it all worth it.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.435
Oh, my goodness.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.070
At least until
the next morning.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.313
After what Pure Voodoo
had done,

14:40.347 --> 14:42.449
I didn't know whether
to call an itch doctor

14:42.482 --> 14:43.483
or a witch doctor.

14:43.516 --> 14:46.353
Voodoo got me!

14:53.160 --> 14:54.627
After my mother went
to the doctor,

14:54.661 --> 14:56.296
I was afraid I might be next.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.597
So what did
the doctor say?

14:57.630 --> 14:59.266
Did you get this
from Goldstein's?

14:59.299 --> 15:01.568
Uh... why?

15:01.601 --> 15:03.503
'Cause they ripped
you off, baby.
No, they didn't.

15:03.536 --> 15:04.938
They did?

15:04.972 --> 15:06.439
Yes, this
perfume is fake.

15:06.473 --> 15:10.677
They got a lot of nerve selling
fake perfume on Mother's Day.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.612
So what are you
going to do?

15:12.645 --> 15:14.247
We're going to go
get your money back.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.383
While I headed back
to Goldstein's,

15:16.416 --> 15:18.418
my father and Drew chased
a Voltron

15:18.451 --> 15:20.387
all over town like
it owed them money.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.621
Still not here.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.258
Hey, Dad, look.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.227
Jackpot.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.462
Excuse me,
excuse me, sir,

15:29.496 --> 15:30.663
sir, sir.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.699
How much did you
pay for that?
Two dollars.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.734
I'll tell you what,
I'll give you $20 for it.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.669
$20?
$20.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.538
Deal. Son, give
the nice man the toy.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.673
But, Dad, it's a Voltron.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.476
For $20 you can have any
toy in the store you want.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.478
I don't want
anything else.

15:45.512 --> 15:46.546
I want this.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.515
Do you know how
much $20 is worth?

15:48.548 --> 15:50.317
I do. $20.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.451
Exactly.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.353
They both spoke
the same language: cheap.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.522
So give him
the toy.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.159
Here you go, mister.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.693
All right.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.030
There you go.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.731
Five...

16:04.764 --> 16:07.400
That's $20.

16:07.434 --> 16:08.635
Actually, Dad, uh...

16:08.668 --> 16:11.338
this is not the toy
we were looking for.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.406
Drew, what in the world
are you talking about?

16:13.440 --> 16:15.442
Dad.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.244
I want him to have it.

16:17.277 --> 16:18.478
Really?

16:18.511 --> 16:19.446
Thanks.

16:20.513 --> 16:21.981
Yeah, thanks.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.519
That was a really nice
thing you did, son.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.088
Thanks, Dad.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.322
This seems like
a nice moment now,

16:29.356 --> 16:31.691
but when it sunk in how much
money he gave up,

16:31.724 --> 16:33.326
my dad threw up
in the car.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.629
I didn't have time
to formulate a plan,

16:36.663 --> 16:38.731
so I did what I could
to not get recognized.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.100
Why are you dressed
like that?

16:40.133 --> 16:41.634
You look like you're
about to rob the place,

16:41.668 --> 16:43.770
I think I'm going to check out
the new spring clothing line.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.472
Oh, no you're not.
You're staying with me.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.274
We're going to straighten
this mess out.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.475
May I help you?

16:48.508 --> 16:52.445
Yes, I would like to return
this bottle of Pure Voodoo.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.247
What seems
to be the problem?

16:54.281 --> 16:55.382
Well, this

16:55.415 --> 16:57.717
is the problem.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.453
Your expensive perfume
gave me a rash.

17:00.487 --> 17:01.688
Really?

17:01.721 --> 17:05.292
No, I just like
putting on rash cream.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.327
Yes, really.

17:12.799 --> 17:16.269
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

17:20.307 --> 17:22.342
This is not our perfume.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.643
What?

17:23.676 --> 17:27.114
No, my son bought this
perfume from here.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.516
I don't know kind of scam
you guys are trying to run...

17:29.549 --> 17:31.518
And I do not know
what kind of scam

17:31.551 --> 17:32.852
you are
trying to run.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.687
But "Pure" is spelled wrong.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.723
Wait. Let me...

17:36.756 --> 17:38.491
It's right there.

17:38.525 --> 17:39.592
P-E-U-R.

17:39.626 --> 17:40.827
That's wrong.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.762
Although that is
a very good knockoff,

17:42.795 --> 17:44.264
it is a knockoff
nonetheless.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.399
The detail has been put
into matching

17:46.433 --> 17:48.135
the general aromatic
tonality

17:48.168 --> 17:49.636
of Pure Voodoo.

17:49.669 --> 17:50.803
But as is
the case

17:50.837 --> 17:52.805
with most counterfeits,

17:52.839 --> 17:54.141
the packaging
lacks detail.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.276
I should have known
by the ink.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.311
I was about to tell the truth

17:58.345 --> 18:00.447
when the truth came
and told on me.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.514
Aha!

18:01.548 --> 18:03.383
Hey, Lionel. Strike two.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.719
Now what?!

18:06.753 --> 18:09.856
I'm so embarrassed.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.891
When you buy something
for a penny,

18:11.924 --> 18:15.828
unless it's a gum ball,
there's a catch.

18:15.862 --> 18:19.199
Billy Ocean Caribbean Queen

18:19.232 --> 18:21.868
Billy Ocean Sings Sinatra...

18:21.901 --> 18:23.636
Billy Ocean's Greatest Hits...

18:23.670 --> 18:25.238
That one's a single.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.839
"Amount due"?!

18:26.873 --> 18:29.376
Tonya!

18:29.409 --> 18:32.412
Tonya, you know you're not
to order anything in this house

18:32.445 --> 18:34.214
without checking with me
or your mother first.

18:34.247 --> 18:36.549
But it said they were
only for a penny.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.551
Baby, you're old enough
to know, no one's going

18:38.585 --> 18:40.787
to sell you seven Billy Ocean
records for a penny.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.422
They would today.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.291
Look, you're going to have
to be more careful

18:44.324 --> 18:45.225
about the things
you agree to.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.294
Does that mean I have
to return the records?

18:47.327 --> 18:50.630
Well, I'd hate for you
to have to give back

18:50.663 --> 18:51.831
your Mother's Day gift.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.900
So I can keep them?

18:53.933 --> 18:55.735
Thanks, Daddy.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.171
Yeah, but you're
going to have to do
a lot of chores

18:58.205 --> 18:59.706
for a long time to
pay back that money.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.274
Yes, Daddy.

19:01.308 --> 19:04.277
She did one dish,
and he called it even.

19:04.311 --> 19:05.745
Fortunately, the store
let me go,

19:05.778 --> 19:07.747
but unfortunately,
they let me go with my mother.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.483
I don't even want to know
what's in that box, do I?

19:10.517 --> 19:13.220
I want to show
you something.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.188
Do you remember
this macaroni ashtray?

19:15.222 --> 19:17.790
Yeah, I made that for you three
years ago on Mother's Day.

19:17.824 --> 19:21.160
And I almost got cancer trying
to use all 42 slots.

19:21.928 --> 19:24.831
And what about these?

19:24.864 --> 19:26.633
Yeah, the macaroni

19:26.666 --> 19:28.635
shoe insoles.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.303
I made those for you
in fifth grade.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.271
They look good.
Did you ever use them?

19:31.304 --> 19:34.607
No. But that year your
father was laid off

19:34.641 --> 19:36.309
we almost had
to eat them.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.511
And what about this?

19:38.545 --> 19:40.513
A box of macaroni.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.349
Yeah, kind of ran out
of ideas that year.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.917
See, that's why I wanted to
make this year extra special.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.586
These things are worthless.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.521
No, you're wrong, Chris.

19:48.555 --> 19:49.622
These things are priceless.

19:49.656 --> 19:53.393
Only in a worldwide
macaroni shortage.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.528
And I wouldn't trade any
of these gifts

19:55.562 --> 19:56.929
for all of the designer perfume

19:56.963 --> 19:58.598
in the world.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.433
I would even care if you ever
got me another gift.

20:00.467 --> 20:01.468
Liar.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.403
Thanks, Mom.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.705
That Mother's Day,
my mom realized

20:05.738 --> 20:07.707
I would do anything for her.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.710
And let's not forget about
this macaroni belt you got me.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.380
Yeah, I made that for you
in third grade.

20:13.413 --> 20:17.850
Well, it looks like you're going
to have to make another one.

20:17.884 --> 20:21.588
I'm lucky she couldn't find
her macaroni bat.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.290
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:23.323 --> 20:27.427
