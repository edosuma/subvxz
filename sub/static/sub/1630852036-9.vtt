00:28.595 --> 00:31.663
[Noelle] The first concern is,

[Michael] This was
the "I got you" moment.

is it could have

She's very beautiful,

02:10.597 --> 02:13.098
of hanging out here tonight,
is that okay?

02:13.166 --> 02:16.335
[Justin] She told me,

was lying on the floor.

05:16.883 --> 05:20.118

<i>from this chest wound

that there have been
some movement

05:37.170 --> 05:38.403
with inside the blood,

<i>of struggle going on
inside there.</i>

05:43.676 --> 05:46.211
<i>What was obvious to me is
that this wasn't a suicide.</i>

05:48.147 --> 05:50.182
The way she was dressed
and the fact

05:50.283 --> 05:53.118
that she had a stab wound
in the upper chest area,

05:53.219 --> 05:56.888
that's not something
where somebody commit suicide.

<i>more than likely,</i>

06:02.261 --> 06:04.229
<i>was some sexual components
to this.</i>

06:06.866 --> 06:08.300
Just the way
that she was laid out

06:08.401 --> 06:09.968
and that she was undressed.

06:15.441 --> 06:19.077
You could see blood prints
from the suspect

06:19.178 --> 06:21.279
<i>because obviously
she did not leave the area</i>

06:21.381 --> 06:23.482
<i>where she was at.</i>

<i>by the prints

06:32.959 --> 06:34.760
visually see
some of the fingerprints.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.266
<i>The next room
that was significant</i>

06:41.401 --> 06:42.968
<i>was her bedroom.</i>

06:44.137 --> 06:45.871
<i>Inside her bedroom
was obviously a bed,</i>

06:45.972 --> 06:47.539
<i>there was a sheet on top of it,</i>

06:47.640 --> 06:49.408
<i>and what was interesting
about it is that there</i>

06:49.509 --> 06:52.911
<i>was a 10 or 12-inch cutout
on top of her sheet.</i>

06:53.012 --> 06:54.379
And because that we knew
there's gonna be some type

06:54.480 --> 06:56.314
of sexual component to this,
we thought that

06:56.416 --> 06:57.616
that was gonna be relevant.

through even in a frenzied,

07:08.394 --> 07:10.061

short attack like this,

07:10.163 --> 07:13.331
the person was thinking that,
"Hey, this is gonna link me"

to the scene
and I need to make sure

07:14.734 --> 07:16.601
<i>"I dispose it in some way."</i>

07:19.939 --> 07:22.441
They felt
that the underlying material

07:22.542 --> 07:25.243
underneath the sheet
would be productive.

07:30.016 --> 07:31.650
<i>So you start to put a vision
in your head about,</i>

07:31.751 --> 07:34.820

fled probably in a hurry,</i>

07:34.921 --> 07:36.922
<i>let's make sure we do
this correctly,</i>

for monetary gain.

<i>going door to door,

08:09.956 --> 08:12.824
And you sometimes get lucky
and somebody actually see

08:12.925 --> 08:15.260

will be significant.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.484
Sheriff's Department.

08:39.585 --> 08:42.854

08:42.955 --> 08:46.691
"Is this Lori Robert,
Adrianne Robert's mom?"

08:46.792 --> 08:47.826
And I said, "Yes, it is.

08:47.927 --> 08:50.629
Is she okay?" He said, "No."

08:50.730 --> 08:54.933
I said, "Is she alive?"
He said, "No."

08:55.034 --> 08:57.702
And then I took my phone
and I threw it

08:57.803 --> 09:00.205
as hard as I could at the wall.

the phone and...

Det. Bailey told me exactly
what he had told Lori.

09:19.325 --> 09:22.427
<i>I felt removed from my body.</i>

09:22.528 --> 09:24.563
I couldn't comprehend
what had just been told

09:24.664 --> 09:28.600
to me or what was happening
because I had to try

09:28.701 --> 09:31.136
to hold my composure
because now it's time

09:31.237 --> 09:34.039
to find out what we need
to know, right?

09:34.140 --> 09:36.007
What do we have to do?

09:36.108 --> 09:37.208
Of course,
the immediate thing was,

09:37.310 --> 09:38.410
is you need
to make arrangements to get

09:38.511 --> 09:39.911
to Florida as soon as you can.

09:55.528 --> 09:59.464
a little bit of a loop,
I started noticing a bunch of,

09:59.565 --> 10:02.334
uh, vehicles, kind of, parked
all around the place.

10:04.503 --> 10:06.838
<i>I noticed there
was caution tape going</i>

<i>around and that's when
I jumped out of the truck.</i>

10:11.277 --> 10:15.480

10:23.823 --> 10:25.957

what I and Adrianne

10:29.261 --> 10:32.197

the best day of our lives

10:32.298 --> 10:35.967
to that point to being
a total nightmare.

10:36.068 --> 10:39.070
[dramatic music playing]

10:42.308 --> 10:44.009
[Michael]<i> We got a call</i>
<i>to say the Jeep</i>

was found very nearby,
probably three

10:46.212 --> 10:50.015
or four blocks away,
parked at a strip mall.

10:50.116 --> 10:52.217
<i>The lights were on.
It was still running.</i>

10:52.318 --> 10:53.451
<i>The Jeep became
a priority because,</i>

10:53.552 --> 10:55.453
obviously, that was our source
of evidence

10:55.554 --> 10:57.889
because that person
definitely took the Jeep.

11:02.628 --> 11:04.362
<i>Once the Jeep is recovered,
then the...</i>

and connecting them

11:08.968 --> 11:10.235

<i>It's in close proximity
to where the Jeep was at.</i>

11:28.054 --> 11:29.854

would definitely</i>

<i>have video there.</i>

11:32.658 --> 11:34.025
<i>If he went northbound
from where the Jeep</i>

was recovered,</i>

13:03.616 --> 13:05.483
you... Immediately your mind
want to go to

13:05.584 --> 13:08.219
that this is probably
gonna be your killer.

[narrator]
<i>Detectives look for anything</i>

13:11.657 --> 13:15.360
<i>that might help them track
where this person went next.</i>

13:20.099 --> 13:23.234
<i>Just around the corner,
they spot another camera.</i>

13:23.335 --> 13:25.904
[dramatic music playing]

13:26.005 --> 13:27.505
[Michael] We wanna see
this quickly,

13:27.606 --> 13:28.740
we wanna get some leads from it,

13:28.841 --> 13:31.109
we wanna pursue those leads.

13:31.210 --> 13:32.510
[narrator]<i> They rushed</i>

[Michael]<i> You're always</i>
<i>wanting to see that video</i>

13:36.649 --> 13:39.584
<i>so you can actually capture
that event,</i>

13:39.685 --> 13:41.252
<i>then we can come up
with a timeline</i>

13:41.353 --> 13:43.154
<i>at all these events.</i>

13:43.255 --> 13:44.789
<i>We're hoping that this would
have been actually</i>

13:44.890 --> 13:46.658
<i>of the person leaving the Jeep,</i>

13:46.759 --> 13:49.227
him walking
in northbound crossing

13:49.328 --> 13:51.596
the path of the CarMax.

13:55.267 --> 13:56.301
<i>This could be the time
that we're getting</i>

13:56.402 --> 13:57.802
<i>that one shot that we need.</i>

13:57.903 --> 14:00.972
[dramatic music playing]

14:21.727 --> 14:24.829
There's no sign of...

[Michael]<i> Sometimes</i>
<i>it bears fruit,</i>

14:26.565 --> 14:28.433
<i>sometimes it doesn't.</i>

14:28.534 --> 14:29.667
This is one that did not.

[narrator]<i> Officers continue</i>

14:40.412 --> 14:41.746
[Noelle]<i> A witness</i>
<i>told the police</i>

14:41.847 --> 14:44.549
that he observed Adrianne
and an unknown Black male

14:44.650 --> 14:47.418
jogging down Wolford Road.

14:49.021 --> 14:51.356
He described
the behavior is odd.

14:51.457 --> 14:54.125
It was late in the night,
they weren't wearing

14:54.226 --> 14:56.394
workout clothes, and he observed

14:56.495 --> 14:59.264
<i>Adrianne wearing
a dress and holding shoes</i>

14:59.365 --> 15:00.932
in her hands.

15:05.504 --> 15:07.872
[Michael]<i> In fact,</i>
<i>at the bathroom scene,</i>

15:07.973 --> 15:09.507
<i>her feet were scarred
and marred up</i>

15:09.608 --> 15:12.543
from running so I don't know
if she was like possibly

15:12.645 --> 15:13.711
trying to get away
from this person

15:13.812 --> 15:15.413
versus actually running away
from him.

15:17.383 --> 15:19.417
<i>We more of likely thought
that she had been</i>

15:19.518 --> 15:21.753
<i>followed home
right into her residence.</i>

[Jay speaking]

15:40.005 --> 15:42.307

15:57.289 --> 15:58.556
You have shady people

15:58.657 --> 16:00.058
you have just every walk of life

16:00.159 --> 16:02.160
that goes through there.

16:02.261 --> 16:04.929
But I've got the impression
they've been out at other

16:05.030 --> 16:06.831
outings in this...
In this type of environment.

16:06.932 --> 16:08.633
So I don't think it was
gonna be foreign to her.

16:08.734 --> 16:09.968
<i>And I don't think
there was anything sinister</i>

the whereabouts of both

18:14.193 --> 18:16.260
the victim and Jay.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.164
Now, you're looking
at places where people

18:20.265 --> 18:21.532
with cameras all the time.

18:21.633 --> 18:23.101
<i>And they knew

[Noelle]<i> The camera</i>

the car lot had a wide-angle

coming and going that night.

have an exchange,
everything is good,

19:35.807 --> 19:37.542
they're looking for a night out.

19:48.887 --> 19:51.022
Switch to the next angle.

19:51.123 --> 19:54.125
[dramatic music playing]

20:01.466 --> 20:02.733
[Noelle] <i>When Jay and Adrianne</i>

20:02.834 --> 20:05.136

they were by themselves.</i>

20:06.138 --> 20:07.205
<i>They looked relaxed.</i>

20:07.306 --> 20:09.006
They looked like
they're about to have fun.

20:09.107 --> 20:12.743
They looked like it's gonna be
a good night that evening.

20:18.817 --> 20:20.117
[Michael]<i> At that time</i>
<i>there was very few people</i>

20:20.219 --> 20:22.320

20:22.421 --> 20:23.354
<i>You knew what they were wearing,</i>

20:23.455 --> 20:24.488
<i>you knew that was them.</i>

20:24.590 --> 20:26.424
The quality
of it was pretty good.

20:28.193 --> 20:30.695
Let's check out
Jay Leffue's timeline.

20:31.964 --> 20:34.565
Fast forward to 2:30 AM.

20:43.408 --> 20:44.675
[Noelle]<i> At 2:53 AM,</i>

20:44.776 --> 20:46.911
the video surveillance shows
Jay Leffue

20:47.012 --> 20:49.413
leaving the club alone
by himself.

20:53.885 --> 20:55.953
<i>He's walking across
the parking lot</i>

20:56.054 --> 20:59.290
<i>to the sidewalk
and starts walking home.</i>

20:59.391 --> 21:02.460
[dramatic music playing]

21:04.363 --> 21:05.529
[Michael]<i> We want to be</i>
<i>able to put people</i>

21:05.631 --> 21:06.998
<i>at different times
where they were at</i>

21:07.099 --> 21:09.333
<i>by this timestamp of the video.</i>

21:09.434 --> 21:12.970
It just solidify that he was
not a suspect in this.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.374
Okay. Let's take it back.

21:16.475 --> 21:18.609
[Michael] We knew how critical
the video was going to be

21:18.710 --> 21:20.344
that we didn't want
to leave it to chance.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.546
<i>We wanted to make sure
when is she leaving.</i>

21:22.648 --> 21:25.650
[dramatic music playing]

21:32.057 --> 21:34.625
At 1:38, Adrianne
is leaving the club.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.001
<i>The video shows she's by herself</i>

21:44.102 --> 21:45.936
<i>and there's no one with her.</i>

21:47.639 --> 21:48.606
Keep it playing.

21:48.707 --> 21:51.709
[dramatic music playing]

22:02.454 --> 22:04.488
[tense music playing]

22:06.358 --> 22:09.393
[Noelle] Four seconds later,
a stranger comes out

22:09.494 --> 22:13.097
that door and he's running.

22:13.198 --> 22:15.399
Could that be the guys
she's been sitting with?

22:18.470 --> 22:20.037
Hold it there.

22:20.138 --> 22:23.374
[dramatic music playing]

22:23.475 --> 22:24.675
[Michael] Based on Jay's
description,

22:24.776 --> 22:25.876
I was able to look at
and said that's the guy

22:25.977 --> 22:27.545
he described.

22:27.646 --> 22:28.646
Because he was wearing the hat,

22:28.747 --> 22:30.448
you could tell the whole thing.

22:33.518 --> 22:36.654
Switch to the next angle.

22:36.755 --> 22:39.256
[tense music playing]

22:46.531 --> 22:47.932
[Noelle]<i> You'd see that</i>
<i>there was a Black male,</i>

22:48.033 --> 22:49.700
<i>he runs out
into the parking lot,</i>

22:49.801 --> 22:51.769
he hands Adrianne
her black sweater

22:51.870 --> 22:54.905
or her shawl that she had
left behind in the club.

22:55.006 --> 22:57.174
[tense music playing]

23:00.679 --> 23:02.313
[Michael] They engaged
in some type of conversation.

23:02.414 --> 23:03.447
You don't know what it is
but you can see

23:03.548 --> 23:05.082
there's conversation
going back and forth

23:05.183 --> 23:07.485
between the two.

23:07.586 --> 23:09.987
<i>The difference in this
was usually that interaction</i>

23:10.088 --> 23:11.922
stops right that point,
the person is leaving,

23:12.023 --> 23:14.024
<i>they give them the item
they left in,</i>

23:14.126 --> 23:15.359
<i>they run back in on their own,</i>

23:15.494 --> 23:16.560
<i>and that's the last contact.</i>

23:16.661 --> 23:19.530
[tense music playing]

23:29.274 --> 23:31.409
[Noelle]<i> The video shows</i>
<i>Adrianne and the Black male</i>

23:31.510 --> 23:35.379
walking out of the parking lot
and turning right.

23:38.216 --> 23:40.451
[Michael]<i> She was heading</i>
<i>towards her residence.</i>

23:40.552 --> 23:43.154

<i>return to the CarMax</i>

23:52.898 --> 23:55.232
<i>surveillance footage.</i>

23:56.935 --> 23:58.869
[Noelle] The individual
on the video surveillance

23:58.970 --> 24:01.939
could have been the suspect
that followed Adrianne home

24:02.040 --> 24:02.673
that night.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.909
[tense music playing]

24:11.516 --> 24:14.051
[Michael] He was not
the same person,

24:19.257 --> 24:21.926
so we can actually
eliminate him as a suspect.

24:22.027 --> 24:24.261
[narrator]<i> Detectives figured</i>
<i>the driver of the Jeep</i>

24:24.362 --> 24:27.531
<i>must have fled
in the opposite direction.</i>

24:27.632 --> 24:28.766
[Michael] <i>It was frustrating.</i>

24:28.867 --> 24:30.034
<i>But any time you
have a murder case</i>

24:30.135 --> 24:31.802
you always gonna have
something thrown in your path

24:31.903 --> 24:33.103
that you are hurdled with
and you're gonna have

24:33.205 --> 24:35.873
to overcome. And this wasn't
any different than any other.

24:35.974 --> 24:38.909
[tense music playing]

24:39.911 --> 24:42.213
[Mark] We went to pick up
Adrianne's things

24:42.314 --> 24:44.315
which was very difficult to do,

24:44.416 --> 24:48.352
<i>to walk in there and see
all her personal items.</i>

24:50.388 --> 24:52.857
She had everything all
ready to go.

24:52.958 --> 24:55.860
She knew that they were
gonna their first night

24:55.961 --> 24:58.529
at the condo together,
I mean, she even had a pretty

24:58.630 --> 25:01.232
little thing that she was
gonna wear for him.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.268
[melancholy music playing]

25:08.440 --> 25:09.707
[Mark]<i> It's hard.</i>

25:09.808 --> 25:11.742
It's hard to look at...
This is your...

25:11.843 --> 25:14.512
Part of your daughter's life
you're looking at.

25:15.313 --> 25:19.083
<i>And, uh, it ends there.</i>

25:19.184 --> 25:21.285
<i>And it shouldn't have.</i>

25:21.386 --> 25:23.888
You're not supposed
to bury your children,

25:23.989 --> 25:25.289
you're just not.

25:25.390 --> 25:28.726
It's inappropriate.
It's not right.

25:31.396 --> 25:33.964
[tense music playing]

25:35.667 --> 25:38.502
When it was first noticed
that the sheet was cut

25:38.603 --> 25:41.972
from the bed,
the first main concern is,

25:42.073 --> 25:44.975
<i>is the DNA gone?</i>

25:45.076 --> 25:47.945
<i>Clearly the person cut the sheet</i>

25:48.046 --> 25:51.582
<i>because they wanted to take
evidence from the scene.</i>

it was on her hands,</i>

26:05.230 --> 26:06.830
<i>it was on the bed,</i>

26:06.932 --> 26:09.300
it was a huge break in the case.

26:10.869 --> 26:14.338
[narrator]<i> Detectives run</i>

26:14.439 --> 26:16.507
<i>While they wait for results,</i>

<i>they piece together
the suspect's movements</i>

26:19.177 --> 26:20.945
<i>that night.</i>

26:21.046 --> 26:23.314
Load up the Diamond Dolls
footage.

26:24.349 --> 26:26.483
See if this gives us
what we need.

26:28.286 --> 26:30.454
[narrator]<i> There is no sign</i>
<i>of the man who followed</i>

26:30.555 --> 26:33.457
<i>Adrianne home
arriving in the evening.</i>

26:33.558 --> 26:35.626
Let's look a little earlier.

26:35.727 --> 26:37.261
[tape rewinding]

26:38.964 --> 26:40.164
If he's not there
in the evening hours,

26:40.265 --> 26:42.199
when did the guy come there?

26:43.201 --> 26:44.635
[heart beating]

26:44.736 --> 26:47.504
[tense music playing]

26:47.606 --> 26:48.839
[man] Stop.

26:50.442 --> 26:51.875
Zoom in.

26:53.912 --> 26:56.413
That's our guy.

26:56.514 --> 26:58.882
[Michael]<i> In the past, you</i>
<i>see a great shadowy subject</i>

26:58.984 --> 27:00.150
and you don't know who it is.

27:00.251 --> 27:02.453
This is actually pretty
pinpoint and then very good.

27:02.554 --> 27:05.189
[tense music playing]

27:05.290 --> 27:07.324
[narrator]<i> Detectives now</i>
<i>have a face</i>

27:07.425 --> 27:09.693
<i>but they need a name.</i>

27:10.695 --> 27:12.630
[tense music playing]

27:19.938 --> 27:21.839
[Michael] We're trying
to determine how this person

27:21.940 --> 27:23.407
got there. He could have
been... He could have brought

27:23.508 --> 27:24.908
his own car, he could have,

27:25.010 --> 27:27.344
8m, been dropped off
by somebody.

27:27.445 --> 27:30.481
[tense music playing]

27:39.758 --> 27:41.725
To see somebody
come up in a taxi

27:41.826 --> 27:44.528
<i>made it, kind of, unusual.</i>

27:44.629 --> 27:45.963
<i>In a town like this,</i>

27:46.064 --> 27:47.865
<i>everybody has their own car.</i>

27:47.966 --> 27:49.133
They're not used as frequently

27:49.234 --> 27:50.334
as they are in New York.

27:50.435 --> 27:53.570
[dramatic music playing]

27:58.076 --> 27:59.643
[Michael]<i> If the person</i>
<i>getting out of the cab</i>

27:59.744 --> 28:02.479
was the person that had
followed Adrianne out,

28:02.580 --> 28:05.983
we knew that we could quickly
get that person identified.

28:06.084 --> 28:08.886
[tense music playing]

28:16.928 --> 28:18.896
When the cab showed up
and he got out of that car,

28:18.997 --> 28:21.365
this was the "I got you" moment.

28:23.268 --> 28:25.469
[Noelle] At that moment,
we knew we would be able

28:25.570 --> 28:26.670
to identify him.

28:26.771 --> 28:29.306
[tense music playing]

28:29.407 --> 28:32.042
[Michael] And the melee
wheel start going fast.

28:32.143 --> 28:35.179
What cab number is that,
what's the phone number?

28:35.280 --> 28:36.947
[man]<i> I need some</i>
<i>information on a cab that</i>

28:37.048 --> 28:39.850
did a drop off at the
Diamond Dolls on the 13th.

28:39.951 --> 28:41.318
[Michael] <i>Who he said he was?</i>

28:41.419 --> 28:42.920
What phone number did he give?
What instruction...

28:43.021 --> 28:44.154
Where did you pick
this person up?

28:44.255 --> 28:46.123
This is all happening
in like a millisecond.

28:46.224 --> 28:48.492
<i>Everybody's having
the same idea.</i>

28:48.593 --> 28:49.727
We got a number.

28:49.828 --> 28:53.297
[dramatic music playing]

28:53.398 --> 28:55.833
[Noelle]<i> The police were able</i>
<i>to search that phone number</i>

28:55.934 --> 28:59.236
in a database and learned
that that phone number

28:59.337 --> 29:01.238
belong to Thomas Frederick.

29:01.339 --> 29:04.174
[tense music playing]

29:08.913 --> 29:11.415
[Michael]<i> I was able to get</i>
<i>his driver's license photo.</i>

29:13.351 --> 29:14.885
And obviously, we could tell

29:14.986 --> 29:17.421
<i>from the driver's license photo</i>

29:17.522 --> 29:20.157
and the surveillance video

29:20.258 --> 29:23.393
that this is one
and the same person.

29:23.495 --> 29:27.030
[narrator]<i> There's no DNA</i>
<i>on file for Thomas Frederick.</i>

29:30.835 --> 29:33.871
We then have our surveillance
team sitting on him.

29:33.972 --> 29:38.442
<i>They had instructions
to get a DNA sample from him.</i>

29:38.543 --> 29:40.310
Like soot of a cigarette
or a coffee cup

29:40.411 --> 29:42.946
or something like that
clandestinely.

29:45.216 --> 29:47.384
You don't want to obviously
alert him

29:47.485 --> 29:49.419
to what was going on.

29:51.322 --> 29:52.723
So you have to pick
your opportunity.

29:52.824 --> 29:54.625
So, you may surveil
this person or something

29:54.726 --> 29:57.161
like the time and only get
one opportunity to do this.

29:57.262 --> 30:00.097

30:05.103 --> 30:06.470
[Mark]<i> Picking up the Jeep</i>

30:06.571 --> 30:10.140
when they were done dusting it,

30:10.241 --> 30:12.643
<i>it was hard to see
when I got there</i>

30:12.744 --> 30:16.079
<i>because I know that he stole it.</i>

30:16.181 --> 30:18.549
<i>The seats were covered
in brown paper and...</i>

30:18.650 --> 30:21.652
<i>So that we could sit
in there and drive it.</i>

30:22.554 --> 30:26.857
And when I got into
the driver seat,

30:26.958 --> 30:29.159
of course the animal
that took my daughter's life

30:29.260 --> 30:32.129
was the one that drove it last.

30:32.230 --> 30:34.231
So, all I could feel was like,

30:34.332 --> 30:37.401
oh, I didn't...

30:37.502 --> 30:39.736
It was just hard to sit
in that seat.

[melancholy music playing]

[Lori]<i> Driving the Jeep...</i>

30:46.811 --> 30:50.113
<i>from the impound</i>

30:50.215 --> 30:51.582
was the hardest thing to do

30:51.683 --> 30:53.684
because I had ridden
in that Jeep

30:53.785 --> 30:57.321
and had fun
in that Jeep with her.

30:59.991 --> 31:02.392
You know, I just
want her back so bad.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.535
[tense music playing]

31:13.638 --> 31:15.005
The suspect was being followed

31:15.106 --> 31:18.375
by our surveillance folks
for some length of time.

31:25.783 --> 31:28.852
<i>Ultimately, the hard work
paid off.</i>

31:28.953 --> 31:31.221
<i>As he threw the cigarette butt,</i>

31:31.322 --> 31:33.423
this is the time
they've been waiting for.

31:33.524 --> 31:36.159
[intense music playing]

31:38.930 --> 31:41.565
[Michael]<i> They had grabbed</i>
<i>the cigarette butt,</i>

31:43.768 --> 31:45.636
<i>jumped back in the car
and continue on.</i>

31:45.737 --> 31:48.705
<i>All without him seeing
what was going on.</i>

31:48.806 --> 31:51.308
<i>They rushed that over to the
lab so we can now compare</i>

31:51.409 --> 31:53.443
<i>this to this person.</i>

31:56.714 --> 31:58.715
[tense music playing]

31:58.816 --> 32:00.217
[narrator]<i> They ran</i>
<i>Frederick's DNA</i>

32:00.318 --> 32:03.453
<i>against the samples
found in Adrianne's home.</i>

32:03.554 --> 32:05.555
This is a very tense moment,

32:05.657 --> 32:08.659
we're all waiting for
this particular moment.

32:08.760 --> 32:12.095
<i>They had already developed
the DNA profile.</i>

32:12.196 --> 32:14.298
<i>I've made several calls
to the lab to try</i>

32:14.399 --> 32:16.099
<i>to get this rushed and
they were already rushing it.</i>

32:16.200 --> 32:18.936
<i>Because I knew that we had
a small window of time.</i>

32:19.037 --> 32:20.837
<i>As he could be thinking
about leaving the state,</i>

32:20.939 --> 32:22.706
going to visit people in
another part of the country.

32:22.807 --> 32:25.409
[tense music playing]

32:26.978 --> 32:29.413
So clearly,
time is of the essence.

32:29.514 --> 32:31.682
[tense music playing]

32:37.255 --> 32:38.822
[Noelle] There was a match.

32:43.695 --> 32:44.728
[tense music playing]

32:48.466 --> 32:50.167
[Michael] The undercover
people went in,

32:50.268 --> 32:52.035
made contact with him.

32:54.105 --> 32:56.239
Put him in the police car
and drove him to the station

32:56.341 --> 32:58.075
without incident.

33:00.912 --> 33:03.180
[Noelle] They finally were
able to now make an arrest

33:03.281 --> 33:05.816
for the murder of Adrian Robert.

33:05.917 --> 33:08.919
[tense music playing]

[Noelle]<i> The first 40</i>

33:19.163 --> 33:22.766
<i>talking about friends,

33:24.936 --> 33:27.137

33:58.970 --> 34:01.104
He's gonna act like
he doesn't but he's like,

34:36.674 --> 34:39.843
<i>At that point,

point in this

"You killed her
and we have your DNA,

36:25.082 --> 36:28.084
He now knows that we knew this
all along.

36:28.186 --> 36:31.054
So then now is...
He's looking out

36:31.155 --> 36:33.390
for his best interest in this.

36:34.559 --> 36:37.561
[Frederick speaking]

37:13.631 --> 37:14.798
I knew that was gonna be
his story,

37:14.899 --> 37:16.132
was never to come off of it,

37:16.234 --> 37:18.068
<i>I got out of that interview
that I needed,</i>

37:18.169 --> 37:19.903
<i>then we shut it down.</i>

37:20.004 --> 37:21.905
Thomas Frederick charged with,
uh, one count

37:22.006 --> 37:24.641
of first degree murder.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.543
[narrator]<i> In January 2014,</i>

<i>of what happened that evening</i>

37:34.385 --> 37:37.887
<i>when Adrianne and Jay
went to the strip club.</i>

37:37.989 --> 37:39.289
She's walking in with Jay,

37:39.390 --> 37:42.592
<i>she's all happy and things
are going well.</i>

37:44.228 --> 37:46.329
<i>They're initially sitting
together</i>

37:46.430 --> 37:48.665
<i>and for some reason, he went
to another part of the club</i>

<i>and was not within
the eyesight of her.</i>

37:54.805 --> 37:57.140
<i>Thomas Frederick
was still sitting with her,</i>

37:57.241 --> 37:59.442
so he probably saw this
as an opportunity that Jay

37:59.543 --> 38:01.978
was no longer there and then,
she was leaving,

38:02.079 --> 38:04.581
he took that as an opportunity
to try to approach her.

38:04.682 --> 38:07.584
[tense music playing]

38:10.788 --> 38:12.789
[Noelle]<i> When Adrianne left</i>

something he wanted

38:18.195 --> 38:19.929

by any means.

38:20.031 --> 38:22.732

<i>[Michael] "What can I do?

38:29.073 --> 38:30.006
<i>going back and forth.</i>

38:30.107 --> 38:32.042
<i>"Should I go back in there
and seek safety,</i>

38:32.143 --> 38:35.645
<i>should I call with Jay,

38:35.746 --> 38:38.748
[tense music playing]

38:41.485 --> 38:42.919
[Michael]<i> Probably</i>
<i>she's walking... She's like,</i>

38:42.987 --> 38:44.521
<i>"This is going bad."</i>

38:44.622 --> 38:46.056
<i>So that's when I think
where the running start,</i>

38:46.157 --> 38:47.524
<i>"she was like, "I'll probably
outrun this person</i>

38:47.625 --> 38:49.192
<i>and let me get out of here."</i>

38:49.293 --> 38:51.861
I think that he probably
just followed her home.

38:51.962 --> 38:53.997
<i>Got into her house.</i>

38:54.098 --> 38:56.900
[tense music playing]

38:58.769 --> 39:00.170
[Michael]<i> She probably</i>
<i>was being kind,</i>

39:00.271 --> 39:02.806
"Maybe if I let this guy use
the restroom or use the phone,

39:02.907 --> 39:04.641
he can just get the hell out
here and I'll be done

39:04.742 --> 39:06.042
with him. I'll lock the door,
and I won't answer the door

39:06.143 --> 39:07.877
and we'll all be done."

39:07.978 --> 39:11.981
He was not going to leave
without taking what he wanted.

39:13.818 --> 39:17.420
<i>He went into the kitchen,
he grabbed the knife.</i>

39:19.223 --> 39:22.792
He went up the stairs
and went into her bedroom.

39:24.729 --> 39:28.431
<i>At which time he used
the knife to overpower her.</i>

39:29.734 --> 39:32.702
<i>The injuries that she had
to her body</i>

39:32.803 --> 39:34.471
<i>were not the result</i>

39:34.572 --> 39:38.441
<i>from consensual sex whatsoever.</i>

39:38.542 --> 39:40.610
The bruises to her arm

39:40.711 --> 39:42.979
were consistent
with being held down.

39:43.080 --> 39:44.781
<i>The bruises were consistent</i>

39:44.882 --> 39:48.651
<i>with sexual battery.</i>

39:48.753 --> 39:50.320
I believe he raped her

39:50.421 --> 39:52.689
and forced her to go
into the bathroom

39:52.790 --> 39:55.258
<i>at which time
he then killed her.</i>

40:00.398 --> 40:02.832
The last moments
of Adrianne's life

40:02.933 --> 40:05.935
were absolutely terrifying.

40:08.873 --> 40:10.540
[Michael]<i> He obviously</i>
<i>attempted to clean up</i>

40:10.641 --> 40:13.109
<i>the crime scene
by cutting out the sheet</i>

40:13.210 --> 40:14.444
<i>on the... on the bed</i>

40:14.545 --> 40:16.045
and grabbed her car keys

40:16.147 --> 40:17.814
which were on the hook
downstairs,

40:17.915 --> 40:20.016
<i>then took her Jeep
for a few blocks</i>

40:20.117 --> 40:23.653
<i>and abandoned the Jeep nearby.</i>

40:23.754 --> 40:25.855
[narrator]<i> Thomas Frederick</i>
<i>is found guilty</i>

40:25.956 --> 40:27.223
<i>of first degree murder</i>

40:27.324 --> 40:29.893
<i>and one count of grand
theft auto.</i>

40:29.994 --> 40:31.561
<i>Due to a lack of evidence,</i>

40:31.662 --> 40:34.063
<i>there was no charge of rape.</i>

40:35.099 --> 40:37.600
[Noelle] There was nothing
that he told police

40:37.735 --> 40:39.335
that was backed by the evidence.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.471
[tense music playing]

40:41.572 --> 40:42.806
[Michael]<i> Video footage</i>

40:42.907 --> 40:44.541
<i>was extremely critical
to the case</i>

40:44.642 --> 40:45.975
and also finding the killer.

40:46.076 --> 40:48.912
Without it, we may
have been unsuccessful.

40:50.514 --> 40:52.749
[Noelle]<i> Thomas Frederick</i>
<i>was sentenced to life</i>

40:52.850 --> 40:53.950
without parole.

40:54.051 --> 40:55.985
In Florida, that means
he will spend the rest

40:56.086 --> 40:59.255
of his life in prison
and will never get out.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.929
<i>Adrianne went out
with a roommate for a night</i>

41:06.030 --> 41:09.599
<i>of fun until he came along.</i>

41:09.700 --> 41:12.635
And the frightening part is it
could have happened to anyone.

41:12.736 --> 41:16.606
[dramatic music playing]

41:16.707 --> 41:19.676
[Mark]<i> Tired.</i>
<i>Every day I struggle.</i>

41:19.777 --> 41:21.044
It doesn't bring her back

41:21.145 --> 41:24.080
but they'd got
the guy that did it.

41:24.181 --> 41:25.315
<i>And I know the biggest thing</i>

41:25.416 --> 41:26.716
<i>that I kept thinking was this,</i>

41:26.817 --> 41:27.984
<i>that he won't be able to do it</i>

41:28.085 --> 41:30.687
<i>to any other young woman again</i>

41:30.788 --> 41:34.491
because you got to be an
animal to do what he did.

41:37.094 --> 41:40.530
[Justin]<i> Whenever I see</i>
<i>photos of Adrianne</i>

41:40.631 --> 41:44.400
I just think of, like, how,
like, special a person,

41:44.502 --> 41:47.136
you know, she was and how much,

41:47.238 --> 41:49.272
<i>like, love she always
gave and, uh,</i>

41:49.373 --> 41:52.275
<i>we just try to focus
the good times,</i>

41:52.376 --> 41:55.678
the fun times that we all had.

41:57.648 --> 42:00.583
[Lori]<i> My iPad which</i>
<i>I seem to have been</i>

42:00.684 --> 42:03.887
clinging onto as if it
was the only last piece

42:03.988 --> 42:06.823
of life that Adrian had in her

42:06.924 --> 42:09.692
<i>because the videos
on there with her voice.</i>

42:09.793 --> 42:12.762
I made it. [laughs]

42:12.863 --> 42:16.332
Her laugh, everything.
Just being alive.

42:16.433 --> 42:20.436
I wanna see myself. Oh,
you can't see myself. [laughs]

42:22.373 --> 42:24.908
[Lori]<i> I'm gonna miss her</i>
<i>until the day I die.</i>

42:25.009 --> 42:26.776
<i>"I used to tell her all
the time, "You know,</i>

42:26.877 --> 42:29.312
<i>Adrianne, I'm your mom
until the day I die."</i>

42:29.413 --> 42:33.116
<i>She had a smile on her face
from...</i>

42:33.217 --> 42:34.384
When she was born,

42:34.485 --> 42:37.720
she was just...
You knew she was special.
