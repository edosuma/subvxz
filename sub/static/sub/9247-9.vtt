WEBVTT

00:04.569 --> 00:07.007
Come on, pick a lane,
you jackass!

00:07.094 --> 00:08.486
Mike,
why are you in such a hurry?

00:08.573 --> 00:10.010
We're having dinner
at your mom's house.

00:10.097 --> 00:12.751
You should be trying
to drive over nails.

00:12.838 --> 00:15.363
We can't be late now
that my mom's dating my boss.

00:15.450 --> 00:18.061
If we're not there on time,
it goes on my permanent record.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.758
Well, if it's gonna
make you crazy

00:19.845 --> 00:21.630
why'd you accept the invitation
in the first place?

00:21.717 --> 00:23.893
It wasn't an invitation.
It was a direct order.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.590
The captain walked
into the locker room and said

00:25.677 --> 00:27.157
"Biggs, dinner
at your mother's house.

00:27.244 --> 00:28.463
"Don't be late,
and for God sakes

00:28.550 --> 00:30.682
cover your privates."

00:30.769 --> 00:32.032
He saw you naked?

00:32.119 --> 00:33.990
I just got out of the shower.

00:34.077 --> 00:35.470
And you know I like to air dry.

00:35.557 --> 00:37.559
Only too well.

00:37.646 --> 00:39.430
You know, you could have just
told him we had other plans.

00:39.517 --> 00:41.432
We do it with your mom
all the time.

00:41.519 --> 00:44.044
In fact, isn't tonight
our weekly tango lesson?

00:44.131 --> 00:45.523
You know, we're gonna
pay for that one day.

00:45.610 --> 00:47.438
When we least expect it,
she's gonna put on

00:47.525 --> 00:49.658
a Samba record and say,
"Show me what you got."

00:49.745 --> 00:52.878
It's the pedal
on the right, you idiot!

00:52.965 --> 00:54.924
Mike, quit yelling
at that woman.

00:55.011 --> 00:57.796
She's a poor, old lady
with a handicapped sticker.

00:57.883 --> 00:59.668
Well, she got a pretty
spry middle finger.

00:59.755 --> 01:02.323
Back at you, Witchy Poo!

01:02.410 --> 01:05.543
Look, do me a favor, just don't
butt heads with my mom tonight.

01:05.630 --> 01:09.069
Hey, I have never been
anything, but sweet to that..

01:09.156 --> 01:12.420
...let's just say woman.

01:12.507 --> 01:15.336
I'm sorry, but even Gandhi
would take a swing at her.

01:15.423 --> 01:17.077
True, but for
the next couple of hours

01:17.164 --> 01:19.166
just try to turn
the other cheek.

01:19.253 --> 01:20.819
So, you want me to just
sit there while she treats me

01:20.906 --> 01:23.909
like some loose whore
that stole her son?

01:23.996 --> 01:25.781
That'd be nice, yeah.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.522
Oh, and tell her
she looks pretty

01:27.609 --> 01:29.437
and how much you like
her tuna noodle casserole.

01:29.524 --> 01:32.092
Oh, God,
tuna noodle casserole again?

01:32.179 --> 01:33.832
It's her signature dish.

01:33.919 --> 01:35.617
Hey, maybe you could
ask her for the recipe.

01:35.704 --> 01:37.488
Or I could just dig
the can of Campbell's soup

01:37.575 --> 01:40.491
out of the garbage
and read the back.

01:40.578 --> 01:42.145
- Molly.
- Okay.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.016
I will be nice to your mother.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.454
Sweet as pie.

01:46.541 --> 01:49.370
Hey, green means,
go, you fossil!

01:49.457 --> 01:52.416
Yeah, I got a middle finger too!

01:52.503 --> 01:57.856
♪ For the first time
in my life ♪

01:57.943 --> 02:01.295
♪ I see love ♪♪

02:10.608 --> 02:12.088
[instrumental music]

02:12.175 --> 02:15.613
Oh, your mother's
a hell of a cook, Biggs.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.180
If I'd been raised
on this kind of grub

02:17.267 --> 02:20.792
I'd probably be a roly-poly too.

02:20.879 --> 02:23.665
I've actually lost another
two pounds this month, sir.

02:23.752 --> 02:26.320
Well, hopefully those
four helpings of casserole

02:26.407 --> 02:29.497
you had will keep the wind
from blowing you away.

02:29.584 --> 02:32.761
- You know, captain--
- Molly, he's pulling my leg.

02:32.848 --> 02:36.765
- My big, fat leg.
- Let me grab that from you.

02:36.852 --> 02:39.811
You've been slaving away
in that hot kitchen all night.

02:39.898 --> 02:41.161
Thank you, Patty.

02:41.248 --> 02:43.641
I am a little tuckered
especially after

02:43.728 --> 02:47.341
washing all those dishes
and with no help from anyone.

02:47.428 --> 02:51.083
I believe I offered to
lend a hand, Mother Biggs.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.781
I'd just have to
rewash 'em anyway.

02:52.868 --> 02:56.698
She's better with a credit card
than she is with a sponge.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.439
Boy, she's a keeper, huh?

02:58.526 --> 03:01.181
Don't let that fish
flop out of the boat.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.880
[barking]

03:04.967 --> 03:07.056
So, Margaret tells me
that you young people

03:07.143 --> 03:08.100
are trying to start a family.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.537
Ah, that is correct, sir.

03:09.624 --> 03:11.452
We've eliminated
all forms of birth control

03:11.539 --> 03:14.759
and we're fornicating
on a regular basis.

03:14.846 --> 03:16.805
Wow, everybody
needed to know that.

03:16.892 --> 03:19.286
Hey, you guys want to
see my ovulation charts?

03:19.373 --> 03:21.940
[laughing]

03:22.027 --> 03:24.378
She's...she's kidding around.

03:24.465 --> 03:26.336
Anytime she says something
that makes you uncomfortable

03:26.423 --> 03:27.729
she's joking.

03:27.816 --> 03:31.167
That's me. Family clown. Honk.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.433
When I first met her,
I thought she was on drugs.

03:36.520 --> 03:39.131
Jury's still out.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.873
Well, I think family is the most
important thing in the world.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.658
As long as you
can provide for them.

03:43.745 --> 03:46.965
- I agree, sir. We both do.
- Sure.

03:48.793 --> 03:51.100
But it's not easy
raising a family

03:51.187 --> 03:52.797
on a straight cop's salary.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.234
Especially when you've got
hungry mouths to feed.

03:54.321 --> 03:55.931
Don't I know it.

03:56.018 --> 03:58.499
Mike's dad walked the beat
his entire career.

03:58.586 --> 04:02.111
Meanwhile, we had a kid at home
who was teething on ham bones.

04:02.198 --> 04:03.852
Come on, mom, don't exaggerate.

04:03.939 --> 04:05.375
Exaggerate nothing.

04:05.462 --> 04:07.116
I'd toss burritos in his playpen

04:07.203 --> 04:10.467
so he wouldn't chew
through the bars.

04:10.554 --> 04:14.254
Um, you might want to consider
taking the detective test.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.168
It's an extra $20,000 a year.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.128
Plus, we're always looking
for some sharp, young men.

04:19.215 --> 04:22.044
- Twenty thousand dollars?
- Sharp, young men?

04:24.786 --> 04:27.571
Twenty grand would buy you a lot
of shoes, wouldn't it, queenie?

04:27.658 --> 04:30.792
Oh, Momma Biggs, I hope
our children have plenty

04:30.879 --> 04:33.708
of time with you
before you pass.

04:38.930 --> 04:41.846
Anyway...something
to think about.

04:41.933 --> 04:45.154
- Yes, sir.
- Whoa.

04:45.241 --> 04:47.504
This pooch is breaking wind
something fierce.

04:47.591 --> 04:50.377
- I better take him for a walk.
- Thanks, Patty.

04:50.464 --> 04:52.683
Since I switched him
from the dry to the moist

04:52.770 --> 04:55.860
he's been tootin'
the brown whistle.

04:55.947 --> 04:57.209
Put your coat on, Biggs.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.951
- You're on doody duty.
- Yes, sir.

05:00.038 --> 05:01.866
Be good training
for a detective.

05:01.953 --> 05:04.826
Learn how to bag the evidence.

05:04.913 --> 05:07.263
Oh, Patty, you're a stitch!

05:09.874 --> 05:11.963
Your boyfriend has a gun,
my husband has a gun.

05:12.050 --> 05:14.314
How do you want to play this?

05:17.752 --> 05:20.407
Thanks for putting up
with my mom tonight.

05:20.494 --> 05:24.324
It's alright, I'm sure the bite
marks on my tongue will heal.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.804
How about when they both came at
me to take the detective test?

05:26.891 --> 05:29.198
Crazy, right?
I'm not detective material.

05:29.285 --> 05:32.767
Well, clearly your captain sees
something in you that you don't.

05:32.854 --> 05:36.161
My captain's sweet on my mom.
He sees things nobody sees.

05:37.772 --> 05:40.340
Mike, you are a great cop
and a smart guy.

05:40.427 --> 05:43.168
Plus, an extra $20,000 a year
would come in handy.

05:43.255 --> 05:45.606
Do you know what I'd have to do
in exchange for that money?

05:45.693 --> 05:48.565
- Detective stuff?
- Exactly.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.524
Plus, they'd make
me wear a suit

05:50.611 --> 05:54.223
and tying that tie's gonna add
30 extra minutes to my day.

05:54.310 --> 05:56.617
Well, I think
you'd make a great detective.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.314
Remember when somebody stole
your ice cream sandwich

05:58.401 --> 06:00.316
from the freezer, and you
figured out it was Victoria?

06:00.403 --> 06:01.709
Yeah, that was easy.

06:01.796 --> 06:03.537
Your mother doesn't eat,
Vince wasn't home

06:03.624 --> 06:06.583
and there was chocolate around
the rim of Victoria's bong.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.846
Case closed.

06:08.933 --> 06:10.370
You know,
her big blunder was trying

06:10.457 --> 06:12.023
to hide the wrapper
under the couch cushion.

06:12.110 --> 06:15.113
But some savvy sleuth knew
to look there, didn't he?

06:15.200 --> 06:18.378
Well, the key is to get
inside the criminal's mind.

06:18.465 --> 06:19.944
Think like they think.

06:20.031 --> 06:22.643
And that's where
I hide my wrappers.

06:25.297 --> 06:28.213
[instrumental music]

06:30.390 --> 06:32.566
The detective test?

06:32.653 --> 06:33.915
Just because you found
an ice cream wrapper

06:34.002 --> 06:36.526
under a couch cushion?

06:36.613 --> 06:38.789
The Chicago PD doesn't
just guard Dairy Queens.

06:41.705 --> 06:44.360
It's just one example
of my powers of deduction.

06:44.447 --> 06:45.970
Well, as your best friend,
I have to tell you

06:46.057 --> 06:47.929
you're not cut out
to be a detective.

06:48.016 --> 06:49.234
Really, well,
who was the one who found

06:49.321 --> 06:50.845
that old lady's cat
the other day?

06:50.932 --> 06:52.847
Oh, come on.
That cat wasn't missing at all.

06:52.934 --> 06:56.416
It was hiding under
that batty bitch's housecoat.

06:56.503 --> 06:58.374
Yeah, but who thought
to look there?

06:58.461 --> 07:01.116
Nobody in 50 years.

07:01.203 --> 07:02.291
And just because
you heard a meow

07:02.378 --> 07:03.684
and saw a little tail flapping

07:03.771 --> 07:06.034
that doesn't mean
you're Sherlock Holmes.

07:06.121 --> 07:08.166
Clearly, the captain
doesn't share your opinion

07:08.253 --> 07:10.995
because he's the one who
suggested that I take the test.

07:11.082 --> 07:12.736
And there it is.

07:12.823 --> 07:15.086
Your future stepfather
is gonna pull some strings

07:15.173 --> 07:19.003
and push your big ass
up the corporate ladder.

07:19.090 --> 07:20.701
Well, it doesn't take
a detective to figure out

07:20.788 --> 07:22.529
that somebody at this table
is a little jealous.

07:22.616 --> 07:24.008
I'm not jealous of you at all.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.880
And if anyone at this table
should be a detective

07:25.967 --> 07:27.098
it should be me.

07:27.185 --> 07:28.273
Samuel, come here.

07:28.360 --> 07:31.494
Come on, Carl, let it go.

07:31.581 --> 07:34.715
And what is the topic
of today's pissy bitch fit?

07:37.369 --> 07:39.023
Let's say you were
brutally murdered.

07:39.110 --> 07:41.286
Shot in the head, then dragged
into the walk-in freezer

07:41.373 --> 07:45.116
only to be found days later,
bloated and frostbitten.

07:45.203 --> 07:48.206
Did I forget
your hash browns again?

07:48.293 --> 07:51.645
- 'Cause you can just tell me.
- Leave me out of this.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.516
Of the two of us,
which one would you want

07:53.603 --> 07:56.388
investigating your heinous
and senseless murder, him or me?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.652
You two are my only choices?

08:00.262 --> 08:02.656
Okay, well,
between the two of you

08:02.743 --> 08:06.224
I'd have to pick...my ghost.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.490
You can't do that
because your ghost was a witness

08:10.577 --> 08:12.666
and would have seen
the whole thing.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.842
Didn't think of that, did you?

08:16.844 --> 08:19.760
You got me there, Scooby-Doo.

08:19.847 --> 08:21.979
Well, thanks
for this fun game of clue

08:22.066 --> 08:24.504
Colonel Mustard-On-His-Shirt
and Professor Plum Nuts.

08:27.811 --> 08:29.509
You see, what would make
his murder a tough case

08:29.596 --> 08:31.859
is that everybody
who eats here has a motive.

08:36.559 --> 08:39.301
I understand that
you're upset, Mr. Mayor.

08:39.388 --> 08:41.521
Trust me, we've got
our best forensics team

08:41.608 --> 08:43.610
analyzing the samples.

08:43.697 --> 08:45.655
As soon as we get the results

08:45.742 --> 08:48.528
we'll be able to narrow
in on the perpetrator.

08:48.615 --> 08:49.833
Yes, sir.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.183
Number one priority, Mr. Mayor.

08:52.270 --> 08:54.011
Everything alright, sir?

08:54.098 --> 08:57.537
Some neighborhood canine has
been leaving horse-size piles

08:57.624 --> 09:00.757
in front of
the mayor's brownstone.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.063
And he makes you deal with it?

09:02.150 --> 09:03.673
Well, Biggs, with great power

09:03.760 --> 09:07.329
comes ridiculous
responsibilities.

09:07.416 --> 09:09.026
So, what can I do for you?

09:09.113 --> 09:10.854
I thought about what you
said and I'm thinking about

09:10.941 --> 09:12.726
giving that detective test
a shot.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.554
Glad to hear it, your mother
will be very pleased.

09:14.641 --> 09:15.772
And so you know,
I plan on passing

09:15.859 --> 09:17.295
this thing fair and square.

09:17.382 --> 09:19.123
You don't have to offer me
any special favors

09:19.210 --> 09:21.256
unless that's how it works
and then, I'm no snitch.

09:30.352 --> 09:34.748
If you are insinuating that my
relationship with your mother

09:34.835 --> 09:37.577
would give you a leg up,
you are very much mistaken, sir!

09:37.664 --> 09:41.102
- I didn't mean to imply--
- There'll be no special favors.

09:41.189 --> 09:43.060
'In fact, quite the contrary.'

09:43.147 --> 09:46.063
Because of your proximity to me

09:46.150 --> 09:48.675
the detective review board
will be riding you

09:48.762 --> 09:51.808
tighter than your pants!

09:51.895 --> 09:53.941
So not even a glimpse
of the sample test

09:54.028 --> 09:55.986
or a little extra time
in case I get stuck?

09:56.073 --> 09:58.162
No, siree, Bob.

09:58.249 --> 09:59.860
As a matter of fact,
there will probably be

09:59.947 --> 10:03.037
a special proctor breathing down
your neck the whole time.

10:03.124 --> 10:06.127
Proctor?
That doesn't sound good.

10:06.214 --> 10:07.302
Is that word
gonna be on the test?

10:07.389 --> 10:08.956
You're gonna have to hunker down

10:09.043 --> 10:11.741
and win this job
on your own merits.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.787
On my own merits, huh?
Good, good.

10:13.874 --> 10:16.703
That always works out well.

10:16.790 --> 10:20.141
Geez, it's, uh, warm in here,
or is it just me?

10:21.925 --> 10:24.624
I think it's warm
in here becauseof you.

10:31.152 --> 10:32.501
This makes no sense at all.

10:32.588 --> 10:35.504
Is this even
the English edition?

10:35.591 --> 10:37.419
Sweetie, it's late.
Let's go up to bed.

10:37.506 --> 10:38.812
I'll be up in a little while.

10:38.899 --> 10:42.511
I still got to read
a couple chapters.

10:42.598 --> 10:45.514
You know, if you get
this job, it's gonna speed up

10:45.601 --> 10:48.082
the timetable for us moving out.

10:48.169 --> 10:50.214
Let's hope for the best.
That's all we can do.

10:50.301 --> 10:52.739
Yeah, I know, I'm just saying,
we could get a house

10:52.826 --> 10:54.958
start a college fund
for the kids..

10:55.045 --> 10:56.220
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

10:56.307 --> 10:59.702
Our kids might be real idiots.

10:59.789 --> 11:00.790
Are you kidding?

11:00.877 --> 11:02.444
A schoolteacher and a detective?

11:02.531 --> 11:03.967
We're probably talking
medical school.

11:04.054 --> 11:06.666
Medical school?
How about chiropractors?

11:06.753 --> 11:09.973
I think you can do that online.

11:10.060 --> 11:12.976
Want to, uh, head upstairs
and start working

11:13.063 --> 11:16.153
on our first little scholar?

11:16.240 --> 11:18.852
No, I should probably keep
my nose to the grindstone.

11:18.939 --> 11:22.159
Or...you could
come up to the bedroom

11:22.246 --> 11:25.032
and work on your undercover
investigation skills.

11:27.817 --> 11:30.167
N-no. Molly, come on,
I need to study.

11:30.254 --> 11:31.952
I'll let you dust me
for prints when we're done.

11:32.039 --> 11:34.781
Alright, lady!

11:34.868 --> 11:36.478
I'm going down to
the basement and study.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.219
I can't be a detective
and a love machine.

11:38.306 --> 11:40.569
I can't do it!
I'm just one man!

11:42.745 --> 11:45.356
I only need the love machine
for ten minutes!

11:55.932 --> 11:57.717
Hey, sweetie,
am I gonna see you tonight?

11:57.804 --> 12:00.110
No, I got to hit
the library right after work.

12:00.197 --> 12:02.330
You've been at the library
every night this week.

12:02.417 --> 12:03.766
I rarely get to see you anymore.

12:03.853 --> 12:04.854
Well, if I'm gonna
be a detective

12:04.941 --> 12:06.377
I'm gonna have to study.

12:06.464 --> 12:08.379
I know that.
I just miss my husband.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.642
Molly, if I'm gonna pass
this thing, I got to study

12:10.730 --> 12:14.342
and I need all my blood up here.

12:14.429 --> 12:16.866
Well, I wouldn't mind you
sending a little down south.

12:16.953 --> 12:18.563
If you know what I mean.

12:18.650 --> 12:19.826
Look, I told you
last night was a fluke.

12:19.913 --> 12:21.088
I was tired,
I had a heavy meal.

12:21.175 --> 12:22.698
I got a lot of things
on my mind.

12:22.785 --> 12:24.395
Plus, it doesn't just
pop out like a light saber

12:24.482 --> 12:27.747
every time you say,
"Obi-Wan Kenobi."

12:27.834 --> 12:30.184
- Now, where the hell is Carl?
- I'm in the kitchen.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.231
How did you
not know that, detective?

12:36.320 --> 12:37.800
[instrumental music]

12:47.767 --> 12:49.681
Boy, you really been hitting
the books hard lately.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.031
Yeah.

12:51.118 --> 12:53.555
Good to know you can
hit something hard.

12:53.642 --> 12:56.210
- What?
- Nothing.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.560
Sorry. I'll let you bone up.

13:00.518 --> 13:01.606
'Cause I'm guessing
the competition's

13:01.693 --> 13:03.695
gonna be pretty stiff.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.002
- You done?
- Let's see. Hard. Bone up.

13:06.089 --> 13:09.266
Stiff.
Yep, I'm done.

13:09.353 --> 13:11.051
I got a lot
on my mind right now.

13:11.138 --> 13:13.053
I understand,
and it's common for men

13:13.140 --> 13:14.576
in high-pressure
situations to suffer

13:14.663 --> 13:15.707
from erectile dysfunction.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.319
I don't have
erectile dysfunction!

13:18.406 --> 13:20.495
I get it.
Your penis is prioritizing.

13:20.582 --> 13:24.325
It's taking a little break.
You know, pause for the cause.

13:24.412 --> 13:25.979
- Your junk is on a junket.
- Carl!

13:26.066 --> 13:27.632
Mm.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.462
You know, even if
you make detective

13:31.549 --> 13:33.116
the pressure's just
gonna get worse.

13:33.203 --> 13:35.336
I'm just trying
to better myself, okay?

13:35.423 --> 13:37.207
Provide for my wife
and future children.

13:37.294 --> 13:39.340
No, that's beautiful,
and with the added salary

13:39.427 --> 13:40.689
you'll have plenty
of money for boner pills.

13:40.776 --> 13:43.344
Alright, we're done talking!

13:43.431 --> 13:45.172
Or you can get one of
those new penile implants.

13:45.259 --> 13:46.521
They're high-tech now.

13:46.608 --> 13:48.871
You can inflate 'em
like a bicycle tire.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.786
Can't pump it up at
the gas station though.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.788
I mean, you can, but I wouldn't.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.056
- 'Hey.'
- Hey, honey.

14:00.143 --> 14:01.579
- Dinner's almost ready.
- Not hungry.

14:01.666 --> 14:02.842
Going down
to the basement to study.

14:02.929 --> 14:03.886
Mike, you've
got to give yourself

14:03.973 --> 14:05.279
a break once in a while.

14:05.366 --> 14:07.063
I'm starting to forget
what you look like.

14:07.150 --> 14:08.369
If you're having trouble
with that, there are four

14:08.456 --> 14:10.545
distinctive features
on the human face.

14:10.632 --> 14:13.765
Head shape, eye color,
hair color and..

14:13.853 --> 14:16.116
Damn it, I just a read that!

14:17.944 --> 14:19.728
I'll bring you down
a sandwich later!

14:19.815 --> 14:21.469
[Mike]
'Scars or tattoos!'

14:21.556 --> 14:25.212
'Head shape, eye color,
hair color, scars or tattoos!'

14:25.299 --> 14:28.128
Love you! Your hard work
is gonna pay off!

14:28.215 --> 14:30.043
I believe in you!

14:30.130 --> 14:32.349
That poor son of a bitch
is falling apart.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.484
Yeah, he seems very distracted.

14:36.571 --> 14:38.138
It's probably not
the best time to remind him

14:38.225 --> 14:39.617
to put the toilet seat down.

14:39.704 --> 14:41.358
Oh, is he back to that?

14:41.445 --> 14:43.056
I guess the new knowledge

14:43.143 --> 14:46.189
pushed the old knowledge
out of his head.

14:46.276 --> 14:48.757
Well, all I know is,
last night I splashed down

14:48.844 --> 14:50.846
like Apollo 11.

14:54.850 --> 14:57.505
You know, mom, some people
actually look at things

14:57.592 --> 14:59.550
before they sit on them.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.901
Where's the fun in that?

15:05.034 --> 15:07.602
Mike? Sweetie?

15:10.474 --> 15:12.912
He's tuckered out
from thinking too hard.

15:15.175 --> 15:17.481
- I made you a sandwich.
- Uh, what's going on?

15:17.568 --> 15:20.006
Nothing, just thought
you might be hungry.

15:20.093 --> 15:23.357
I can't eat.
My stomach's in knots.

15:23.444 --> 15:26.142
Listen, if this test
is too much for you

15:26.229 --> 15:27.535
you don't have to do it.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.276
I am perfectly happy
to be married

15:29.363 --> 15:31.321
to the best
beat cop in Chicago.

15:31.408 --> 15:32.627
Well, what about the money?

15:32.714 --> 15:34.324
And we're trying to get
our own house

15:34.411 --> 15:36.631
and we want to have a kid,
and you're probably gonna

15:36.718 --> 15:39.808
make him go to college.

15:39.895 --> 15:41.897
Well, none of that is important.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.595
Especially if it's gonna
make you miserable.

15:44.682 --> 15:46.684
I don't know
if I can do this, Molly.

15:46.771 --> 15:49.122
I'm reading all this stuff
and none of it's sinking in.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.124
Honey, you have worked
with detectives for years.

15:51.211 --> 15:52.952
I'll bet you know more
than you think you do.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.605
I really don't work with them.

15:54.692 --> 15:56.520
They just tell us guys
in uniform to back off

15:56.607 --> 15:59.523
don't step on anything
and keep the crowd away.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.134
Well, you can do that.

16:01.221 --> 16:03.484
Yeah, I can do that,
but the book says we're supposed

16:03.571 --> 16:06.313
to secure the perimeter,
establish a chain of command

16:06.400 --> 16:09.229
and preserve the integrity
of the crime scene.

16:09.316 --> 16:12.580
You mean, tell
the regular cops to back off

16:12.667 --> 16:15.539
don't step on anything,
keep the crowds away?

16:19.195 --> 16:20.283
Wait, it's the same thing,
isn't it?

16:20.370 --> 16:23.460
That's what I'm hearing.

16:23.547 --> 16:25.767
So maybe if I just take
what I already know and--

16:25.854 --> 16:28.074
Just apply all this
technical jargon

16:28.161 --> 16:29.771
that you've been reading, and..

16:29.858 --> 16:32.078
...bim-bam-boom,
you're a detective.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.821
- It can't be that simple.
- Well, hmm, let's see.

16:36.908 --> 16:39.563
Describe one of
the last calls you were on.

16:39.650 --> 16:42.349
Uh, an old lady
lost her cat and I found it

16:42.436 --> 16:44.786
hiding under her housecoat.

16:47.789 --> 16:50.226
Wow, that's tax dollars
well spent.

16:50.313 --> 16:53.708
Um...okay,
now-now describe it to me

16:53.795 --> 16:55.579
how a detective would.

16:55.666 --> 16:57.451
Um..

16:57.538 --> 17:00.149
...after weighing
the circumstantial evidence

17:00.236 --> 17:02.847
I ascertained that
the victim's feline property

17:02.934 --> 17:06.025
was located on her person.

17:06.112 --> 17:09.811
- Hello, Johnny Law!
- Son of a gun!

17:09.898 --> 17:12.466
It's just making
stupid stuff sound smart!

17:12.553 --> 17:15.425
That's how the world goes round.

17:15.512 --> 17:17.253
- Thanks, sweetie.
- Well, I'll be upstairs.

17:17.340 --> 17:18.298
Lemme know if you need anything.

17:18.385 --> 17:19.690
I'll be fine.

17:19.777 --> 17:21.214
Hey, uh, did you know
there's a full bathroom

17:21.301 --> 17:23.390
and shower down here?

17:23.477 --> 17:26.175
I may have mentioned that
to you a couple of times.

17:26.262 --> 17:30.310
Just-just keep studying.

17:30.397 --> 17:33.835
[chuckles]
And me down here peeing
in an empty bleach bottle.

17:37.882 --> 17:40.102
Oh, a pickle.

17:47.892 --> 17:50.199
- Seventy-six percent!
- You passed!

17:50.286 --> 17:51.592
Yeah, by two points.

17:51.679 --> 17:54.725
I actually could have
missed another question.

17:54.812 --> 17:56.162
So are you a detective now?

17:56.249 --> 17:58.164
Well, there were
only two vacancies

17:58.251 --> 17:59.252
and a lot of guys took the test.

17:59.339 --> 18:02.385
I am, however,
112th on the list.

18:03.430 --> 18:06.302
Take that, 113!

18:06.389 --> 18:08.261
I'm thinking by the time
our kids start school

18:08.348 --> 18:10.567
I'll be Detective Michael Biggs.

18:10.654 --> 18:14.354
I am so proud of you.
You rose to the challenge!

18:14.441 --> 18:16.312
Ah, speaking of which..

18:16.399 --> 18:19.272
Oh. It's back.

18:19.359 --> 18:20.795
As soon as I got my score,
he was the first

18:20.882 --> 18:22.318
to congratulate me.

18:22.405 --> 18:23.972
I'm gonna go upstairs and hide!

18:24.059 --> 18:27.193
You count to 20 and then
try to find me, detective!

18:27.280 --> 18:29.195
One, two, three..

18:29.282 --> 18:32.154
This is gonna be easy, I'm
working with a divining rod.

18:32.241 --> 18:34.852
Four, five, six..

18:38.682 --> 18:41.207
[theme music]
