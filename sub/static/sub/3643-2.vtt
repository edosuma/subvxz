15:13.406 --> 15:15.240
Help my social media outreach.

15:15.242 --> 15:17.208
(Ollie) You know, be like, "I
want to set up this meeting.

15:17.244 --> 15:20.412
It's like a very, like a... " Oh, Elliot!

15:20.732 --> 15:22.141
(Ollie) Hey, congrats, man.

15:22.142 --> 15:24.798
Allsafe is all over the
internet today because of you.

15:24.799 --> 15:27.284
Dude, we should celebrate.
We have this Groupon

15:27.336 --> 15:29.286
for four at Morton's on Thursday.

15:29.288 --> 15:31.422
This other couple we were
going with totally bailed.

15:31.457 --> 15:32.790
Why don't you come with?

15:32.792 --> 15:34.792
Their steaks are badass. It's $29.95...

15:34.827 --> 15:35.926
(Angela) I'm not sure that
Elliot would like that.

15:35.962 --> 15:37.011
Yeah, okay.

15:37.046 --> 15:39.630
Yeah? Okay. Awesome, man.

15:39.632 --> 15:42.633
And, hey, why don't we
make it a double date?

15:42.635 --> 15:44.018
I heard that you had a girlfriend.

15:44.053 --> 15:46.186
Ollie, you weren't
supposed to say anything.

15:46.222 --> 15:47.638
(Ollie) Babe, it's cool.
Elliot's okay with it.

15:47.690 --> 15:49.974
Yeah, okay, sure. I... have to go.

15:49.976 --> 15:53.560
Um, my neighbor's complaining
about the dog barking again.

15:59.318 --> 16:02.404
- (Angela) Since when does he have a dog?
- (Cisco) Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

16:02.405 --> 16:03.454
You look like a beautiful couple.

16:03.489 --> 16:04.705
Yo, my album just dropped,

16:04.740 --> 16:06.206
You like rap, hip-hop?

16:06.242 --> 16:08.542
Yo, this shit is deep, lyrical, poetic.

16:08.577 --> 16:10.210
Yo, your girl will like
this, my man, I swear.

16:10.246 --> 16:11.462
Come on, bro, you've
been outside our building

16:11.497 --> 16:12.663
for two weeks now.

16:12.665 --> 16:13.998
All right, you know, I'll take it,

16:14.000 --> 16:15.332
if you leave us alone.

16:15.384 --> 16:17.334
Thank you, thank you, man, thank you.

16:17.336 --> 16:19.503
And I'll tweet, but only
if I like it, all right?

16:19.555 --> 16:21.388
I only have 48 followers, but it's growing.

16:21.424 --> 16:22.973
- No doubt, no doubt.
- Some tastemakers in there so...

16:23.009 --> 16:24.058
I feel you, I feel you.

16:24.093 --> 16:25.309
- Yeah.
- All right.

16:25.344 --> 16:26.677
Yo, I appreciate it, man, really.

16:26.729 --> 16:28.062
- You guys have a good day.
- Yeah, you too.

16:28.097 --> 16:29.396
Thank you so much. Check track two out.

16:29.432 --> 16:32.349
- Track two.
- All right, man.

16:32.351 --> 16:33.734
(Elliot voice-over) This
was never part of the plan.

16:33.769 --> 16:36.020
Data dumps? Releasing Terry Colby?

16:36.072 --> 16:37.855
None of this makes sense.

16:37.907 --> 16:40.407
Need to cut off all ties with Fsociety.

16:40.443 --> 16:41.859
Need to disconnect.

16:41.861 --> 16:43.577
We need to call in sick
and lie low for a...

16:43.612 --> 16:45.913
[dog whining] [shower running]

16:45.948 --> 16:47.948
[door shuts]

16:59.712 --> 17:02.713
Dude! Jesus Christ! I am naked, asshole!

17:02.715 --> 17:04.548
Don't stare at me!

17:04.550 --> 17:06.266
Why the hell are you in my shower?

17:06.301 --> 17:08.352
Well, I was waiting for you.

17:08.387 --> 17:09.720
You were supposed to come last night.

17:09.771 --> 17:12.222
- Did you forget?
- Come? Where?

17:12.273 --> 17:14.273
It's fine, everyone's coming later.

17:18.646 --> 17:20.614
[Darlene sighs]

17:20.648 --> 17:23.117
I'm stealing your clothes.

17:23.152 --> 17:26.704
My dress has cum stains on it.

17:26.739 --> 17:27.905
[laughs]

17:27.940 --> 17:31.075
Jesus, I am just messing with you.

17:31.110 --> 17:32.609
My stuff is just in the wash.

17:32.645 --> 17:35.579
I'm gonna borrow this for the time being.

17:35.581 --> 17:37.297
Oh, by the way,

17:37.333 --> 17:39.800
your dog shat on your bed.

17:39.835 --> 17:42.920
You gotta walk that thing.

17:42.922 --> 17:46.056
(Elliot) Hey, please
take Flipper for a while.

17:46.092 --> 17:48.058
She probably needs a walk or something.

17:48.094 --> 17:49.893
She keeps shitting everywhere.

17:49.929 --> 17:51.095
Of course she needs a walk, Elliot.

17:51.097 --> 17:52.563
She's a friggin' dog.

17:52.598 --> 17:56.100
Yo, I want to stop and get
some froyo before we go.

17:56.152 --> 17:57.568
[hip hop music playing over headphones]

17:57.603 --> 18:00.437
Uh, I'll be back later.

18:00.439 --> 18:03.440
- I owe you.
- Yeah, big time.

18:14.954 --> 18:17.154
How do you know where I live?

18:17.189 --> 18:19.990
Why wouldn't I know where you live?

18:20.025 --> 18:24.595
I don't know. I don't know where you live.

18:24.630 --> 18:26.513
Well,

18:26.549 --> 18:30.300
I don't live anywhere at the present.

18:30.352 --> 18:34.304
The douche I was dating
proposed to me, can you believe?

18:34.356 --> 18:37.024
I mean, what an asshole.

18:37.059 --> 18:39.777
Anyways, we got into
this huge fight, and...

18:39.812 --> 18:41.678
(Elliot voice-over)
What the hell am I doing?

18:41.714 --> 18:44.148
This chick is out of
her mind batshit crazy.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.283
I gotta go back, tell Gideon everything.

18:46.318 --> 18:47.534
He'll understand, right?

18:47.570 --> 18:48.869
He'll know what to do.

18:48.904 --> 18:51.121
It's whatevs. He'll take me back.

18:51.157 --> 18:52.539
He's just gotta get over this whole

18:52.575 --> 18:55.542
"love is forever" bullshit.

18:55.578 --> 18:57.494
I'll do my disappearing act for a minute,

18:57.546 --> 18:59.463
and then he'll come to his senses.

18:59.498 --> 19:00.664
(male announcer) Stand
clear of the closing door.

19:00.666 --> 19:03.217
You know, it's our thing.

19:03.252 --> 19:05.669
Quick!

19:05.671 --> 19:09.423
[indistinct female announcer over intercom]

19:14.180 --> 19:15.896
(Elliot voice-over) Can she see them, too?

19:15.931 --> 19:17.381
What?

19:17.416 --> 19:21.185
I like to stay on my toes.

19:21.237 --> 19:25.155
Speaking of, that's, like, one
of the most annoying things...

19:25.191 --> 19:28.859
(Elliot voice-over) But what if
Tyrell finds out? What will he do?

19:28.911 --> 19:31.245
Shit, there's basically
no scenario in which

19:31.280 --> 19:34.031
I'm not getting killed or going to jail.

19:34.083 --> 19:37.701
Because I wanted a turtle,
and he was like, "No..."

19:37.753 --> 19:40.087
(Darlene) I might need to crash
with you for a couple of nights.

19:40.122 --> 19:42.372
That's cool, right?

19:42.424 --> 19:44.041
Seriously?

19:44.043 --> 19:46.376
Fine! I'll crash at Mobley's.

19:46.378 --> 19:48.512
Don't love dogs anyway.

19:48.547 --> 19:50.264
Especially ones that shit in your bed.

19:50.299 --> 19:52.382
I mean, how do you live
like that, honestly?

19:52.434 --> 19:54.218
How do you go to sleep when
you know that there's...

19:54.270 --> 19:55.686
(Elliot voice-over) For all we know,

19:55.721 --> 19:57.387
I could be walking into a trap right now.

19:57.389 --> 19:59.556
We could be dead the second
I walk through that door.

19:59.608 --> 20:03.443
Come on, kid. We got big things in store.

20:03.679 --> 20:05.312
Big things.

20:10.726 --> 20:13.728
[clapping]

20:13.764 --> 20:16.231
Man of the hour. Take a curtsy.

20:19.869 --> 20:21.035
[gunshot]

20:21.037 --> 20:22.753
Goddamn ducks.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.456
[three gunshots]

20:25.508 --> 20:26.958
Hey, hey, man!

20:27.010 --> 20:28.960
What's... oh. Shit, sorry, sorry, dude.

20:29.012 --> 20:30.711
Um, okay.

20:30.713 --> 20:32.847
Anyway, just, awesome work, man.

20:32.882 --> 20:33.965
Really awesome.

20:34.017 --> 20:35.099
Right on, man. Right on.

20:35.134 --> 20:36.884
- Real cool.
- Great.

20:36.886 --> 20:39.020
So now that we're all done
going down on each other,

20:39.055 --> 20:41.689
can we please hear the plan?

20:41.724 --> 20:43.107
Where are we at with Steel Mountain?

20:43.142 --> 20:44.492
(Mr. Robot) If I'm not mistaken,

20:44.527 --> 20:46.327
these lines aren't 100% safe yet,

20:46.362 --> 20:48.029
and we still haven't made
the Colby project disappear.

20:48.064 --> 20:49.123
Seriously?

20:49.132 --> 20:51.182
It's been weeks. Any links or traces

20:51.234 --> 20:52.517
would have been owned by now.

20:52.569 --> 20:54.819
The lines are clean, Boss, I swear.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.205
- Thank you.
- I mean, um...

20:57.240 --> 20:59.340
if it makes you feel better,
Romero and I can check...

20:59.376 --> 21:01.693
Great! Make me feel great.

21:01.745 --> 21:04.912
I'm gonna hang back over
here, collect my thoughts.

21:07.534 --> 21:08.750
[groans] Ohh!

21:14.257 --> 21:15.707
What's her deal?

21:15.759 --> 21:17.625
Ah, she's a complicated woman.

21:17.627 --> 21:19.727
Most malware coders are. Am I right?

21:19.763 --> 21:22.230
She showed up at my apartment.

21:22.265 --> 21:23.798
Why does she know where I live?

21:23.833 --> 21:25.466
Let's not focus on her. That'll be like

21:25.502 --> 21:27.351
entering a bad K-hole
you'll never wake up from.

21:27.387 --> 21:30.438
Instead, I need you to focus on
the next phase of our project.

21:30.473 --> 21:34.142
Comet, the natural gas
plant up around Albany?

21:36.146 --> 21:39.063
We're gonna blow it up.

21:39.115 --> 21:41.949
Why would you blow...

21:41.985 --> 21:43.901
Comet plant's right next to Steel Mountain.

21:43.953 --> 21:45.987
Which, as you know,

21:45.989 --> 21:48.456
is the off-site and data storage facility

21:48.491 --> 21:49.907
for every corporation in the S&P,

21:49.959 --> 21:51.209
including everyone's favorite...

21:51.244 --> 21:54.045
- Evil Corp.
- [snaps fingers] Bingo!

21:54.080 --> 21:56.547
You're gonna destroy their tape backups.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.800
They're gonna be looking
out for something like that.

21:58.835 --> 22:01.219
They've been on high
alert ever since the hack.

22:01.254 --> 22:03.137
From what I heard, they've
caught their hacker.

22:03.173 --> 22:05.473
- Haven't they?
- No, they haven't.

22:05.508 --> 22:08.009
- Tyrell Wellick knows.
- What they want him to know!

22:08.011 --> 22:10.061
He's a corporate robot
just like the rest of them.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.430
Besides, the entire
company is gonna be reeling

22:12.482 --> 22:14.348
from all the data dumps
we've got in store for them...

22:14.350 --> 22:15.817
and man, do we have some goodies.

22:15.852 --> 22:17.819
Some good old-fashioned executive racism,

22:17.854 --> 22:19.854
sexism, fascism.

22:19.856 --> 22:21.773
Trust me, we are gonna
"ism" so much all over them

22:21.825 --> 22:23.574
they won't be able to see straight.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.777
And asking for Colby's
release as ransom was genius.

22:25.829 --> 22:27.328
That'll only make his spotlight bigger,

22:27.363 --> 22:28.946
keeping it off us.

22:28.998 --> 22:31.833
That neat little ditty was Trenton's idea.

22:31.868 --> 22:34.085
She may look innocent, but I'd be careful.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.921
She's got some Allah Akbar in her.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.539
And while all that's going on,

22:38.541 --> 22:41.042
you will use your
Allsafe security clearance

22:41.044 --> 22:43.544
to hack the Comet PLC,
increase the pressure,

22:43.546 --> 22:45.379
causing a gas pipeline explosion

22:45.381 --> 22:47.181
making Steel Mountain go kablooey

22:47.217 --> 22:49.217
along with Evil Corp's soul.

22:54.390 --> 22:56.641
They know about all this?

22:56.693 --> 22:58.559
You're the first.

23:01.231 --> 23:03.231
Workers?

23:03.233 --> 23:04.649
Anyone living around the plant...

23:04.701 --> 23:06.450
They all die?

23:06.486 --> 23:08.236
We'll give them a head start.

23:08.238 --> 23:11.239
Sound some alarms. They'll be fine.

23:13.576 --> 23:15.409
You're blowing up a gas pipeline.

23:15.411 --> 23:17.545
The world is a dangerous place, Elliot,

23:17.580 --> 23:19.130
not because of those who do evil,

23:19.165 --> 23:21.332
but because of those who
look on and do nothing.

23:21.384 --> 23:22.583
This is war.

23:22.585 --> 23:24.752
People will die. <i>C'est la mort.</i>

23:26.339 --> 23:27.839
And once we blow up the pipeline,

23:27.891 --> 23:30.141
Darlene's worm will kick into high gear

23:30.176 --> 23:31.843
at the U.S. data center

23:31.895 --> 23:35.730
which you helped to us
install, thank you very much.

23:35.765 --> 23:39.183
The redundant backups at their
eastern data center in China...

23:39.235 --> 23:41.652
the Dark Army is covering us on that.

23:41.688 --> 23:44.655
Dark Army? Why, man?

23:44.691 --> 23:46.357
They got no code. They hack for anyone:

23:46.409 --> 23:48.276
terrorists, North Korea, Iran, Russia...

23:48.278 --> 23:49.744
Which means they hate U.S. capitalism

23:49.779 --> 23:53.497
just as much as anyone.

23:53.533 --> 23:56.450
Last but not least.

23:56.452 --> 23:58.035
Steel Mountain.

23:58.087 --> 24:01.122
The hacker's dilemma. What to do

24:01.124 --> 24:03.007
when a bunch of data you want to destroy

24:03.042 --> 24:05.209
is completely off the grid?

24:05.261 --> 24:06.544
[explosion noise]

24:11.100 --> 24:13.401
I'm not killing anyone.

24:15.388 --> 24:17.605
Tell me one thing, Elliot.

24:17.640 --> 24:19.640
Are you a one or a zero?

24:21.277 --> 24:22.944
That's the question you
have to ask yourself.

24:22.979 --> 24:25.112
Are you a yes or a no?

24:25.148 --> 24:27.982
Are you going to act or not?

24:30.987 --> 24:33.788
Yo... you've been staring
at a computer screen

24:33.823 --> 24:35.957
way too long, homie.

24:35.992 --> 24:37.708
Life's not that binary.

24:37.744 --> 24:39.660
Isn't it?

24:39.662 --> 24:41.963
Sure, there are grays...

24:41.998 --> 24:44.081
but when you come right
down to it, at its core,

24:44.133 --> 24:48.085
beneath every choice, there's
either a one or a zero.

24:48.137 --> 24:51.222
You either do something or you don't.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.841
You walk out that door,
you've decided to do nothing,

24:53.843 --> 24:57.678
to say no, which means
you do not come back.

24:57.680 --> 25:01.015
You leave, you are no
longer a part of this.

25:01.017 --> 25:03.901
You become a zero.

25:03.937 --> 25:05.686
If you stay,

25:05.688 --> 25:08.773
if you want to change the world,

25:08.825 --> 25:10.574
you become a yes.

25:10.610 --> 25:13.778
You become a one.

25:13.830 --> 25:15.947
So, I'll ask you again:

25:15.999 --> 25:19.250
are you a one or a zero?

25:19.285 --> 25:21.452
An innocent man is in
prison because of what I did.

25:21.504 --> 25:22.954
Come on, let's not kid ourselves!

25:23.006 --> 25:26.540
This has nothing to do with Colby.

25:29.545 --> 25:31.512
This isn't even about my revolution.

25:31.547 --> 25:34.215
This is more than that for you.

25:34.217 --> 25:37.101
This is about how those bastards
slowly killed your father

25:37.136 --> 25:38.769
and how you wished he'd
done something about it.

25:38.805 --> 25:41.689
But he didn't. Because he was a zero,

25:41.724 --> 25:44.225
just like you're being right now.

25:46.229 --> 25:48.229
Fuck you.

25:51.434 --> 25:54.268
Disappearing again?

25:56.272 --> 25:59.406
I'm not killing anyone.
Leave me out of this.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.861
You don't get to disappear from this.

26:03.913 --> 26:05.279
We can do it with or without you,

26:05.281 --> 26:07.531
but you're a part of it either way!

26:07.583 --> 26:10.718
Yeah, even your stupid hoodie
can't protect you, bitch!

26:10.753 --> 26:12.253
(Elliot voice-over) This was a mistake.

26:12.288 --> 26:13.954
I've gotta turn them in.
Should I turn them in?

26:13.956 --> 26:16.257
Will I get into trouble? Shit, she's right.

26:16.292 --> 26:18.959
I'm culpable now. No, we're culpable.

26:18.961 --> 26:22.096
You're in this with me, so
start thinking of solutions now.

26:23.570 --> 26:26.872
[muffled electronic music]

26:26.908 --> 26:28.908
Shayla?

26:33.881 --> 26:35.631
[knocking on door] Yo, Shayla.

26:36.067 --> 26:38.317
Yo, bro.

26:38.369 --> 26:40.903
Can I help you with something?

26:43.374 --> 26:46.959
I, uh... just need to talk to Shayla.

26:46.994 --> 26:48.911
Oh, your girl.

26:48.963 --> 26:50.963
She in the tub.

26:55.169 --> 26:56.802
[knocking on door] Shayla.

26:56.837 --> 26:58.837
Yo, she'll be out in a minute.

27:00.742 --> 27:03.859
Can sit and wait if you want.

27:03.911 --> 27:06.779
I think we should check on
her, make sure she's all right.

27:06.831 --> 27:09.281
[laughs]

27:09.334 --> 27:13.202
You a funny dude. I like you.

27:13.254 --> 27:15.338
Don't be rude.

27:15.373 --> 27:18.207
Sit down and chill.

27:36.027 --> 27:38.561
No, that's right.

27:41.566 --> 27:43.616
You only do this.

27:43.651 --> 27:47.570
Only nigga I know that take
withdrawal meds while he using.

27:47.622 --> 27:49.822
That's smart.

27:49.874 --> 27:52.658
Probably even convinced
yourself you ain't an addict.

27:52.710 --> 27:55.344
[laughs] Oh, shit.

27:55.380 --> 27:57.646
Forgot to introduce myself. I'm Fernan...

27:57.682 --> 27:59.648
(Elliot voice-over) Fernando
Vera, Shayla's supplier.

27:59.684 --> 28:01.817
One of the worst human
beings I've ever hacked.

28:01.853 --> 28:05.521
His password? "eatadick6969."

28:05.556 --> 28:07.456
Aside from the massive amounts of money

28:07.492 --> 28:09.125
he spends on porn and webcams,

28:09.160 --> 28:10.393
he does all his drug transactions

28:10.428 --> 28:12.695
through emails, IMs, Twitter.

28:12.730 --> 28:15.231
The fact that the cops haven't
caught him yet is beyond me.

28:15.266 --> 28:16.999
If they had half a brain cell,

28:17.034 --> 28:19.502
they'd be able to crack
his gang's simplistic code,

28:19.537 --> 28:21.654
if it can even be called that.

28:21.689 --> 28:23.873
After only a couple of
hours of timing his tweets

28:23.908 --> 28:25.341
with related news articles,

28:25.376 --> 28:27.243
I figured out that "biscuit" and "clickety"

28:27.278 --> 28:29.078
clearly referenced guns.

28:29.113 --> 28:32.047
"Food," "sea shells" or "gas" for bullets.

28:32.083 --> 28:34.850
And the ultimate: "rock to sleep early."

28:34.886 --> 28:37.019
I haven't made the direct
connection to a hit yet,

28:37.054 --> 28:38.888
but the math of guns plus bullets

28:38.923 --> 28:41.023
usually adds up to one thing.

28:41.058 --> 28:42.558
I've thought about turning him in,

28:42.593 --> 28:44.727
but he's Shayla's only supplier.

28:44.762 --> 28:47.029
I take him down, I lose my drugs,

28:47.064 --> 28:50.366
and with everything going on
right now, I can't have that.

28:50.401 --> 28:53.035
You get that, though? [inhales]

28:53.070 --> 28:55.204
[laughs] Anyway, bro,

28:55.239 --> 28:58.407
I ain't nothing to worry about.

28:58.443 --> 29:01.861
Just making a drop for you.

29:01.896 --> 29:03.446
What's your name, anyway?

29:05.450 --> 29:07.149
Elliot.

29:07.201 --> 29:08.951
(Vera) What it mean?

29:08.986 --> 29:11.787
What, you ain't never Googled it?

29:11.823 --> 29:13.355
Man, you gotta do that.

29:13.391 --> 29:15.624
The meaning of a person's
name is important, bro.

29:15.660 --> 29:18.928
Yo, she good! She good.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.700
Trust me.

29:24.735 --> 29:27.736
Took care of that shit myself.

29:32.243 --> 29:34.477
You remind me of me when I was younger,

29:34.512 --> 29:36.579
depressed and sullen.

29:36.614 --> 29:40.549
Matter of fact, tried to kill
myself, a couple of times.

29:40.585 --> 29:42.751
Never could get that shit right.

29:42.787 --> 29:45.621
Biology wasn't my strong suit.

29:46.156 --> 29:49.125
I hated myself, man. Still do.

29:49.126 --> 29:52.828
Thought that shit was a
weakness for a long time.

29:58.669 --> 30:02.404
Then I realized that shit was my power.

30:02.440 --> 30:05.307
People walk around, act like
they know what hate means.

30:05.343 --> 30:09.745
Nah, no one does, until you hate yourself.

30:09.780 --> 30:12.281
I mean...

30:12.316 --> 30:15.184
truly hate yourself.

30:15.819 --> 30:17.786
That's power.

30:28.850 --> 30:34.570
You ain't scared of me, are you?

30:34.906 --> 30:36.872
That's good.

30:36.908 --> 30:39.625
Means I didn't waste my
time making friends with you.

30:39.660 --> 30:42.077
[chuckles]

30:42.078 --> 30:44.030
You don't really need these, do you?

30:44.082 --> 30:48.618
Man of your courage can last
through a little withdrawal.

30:48.670 --> 30:53.089
Ya know, you the only
reason why I met Shayla.

30:53.124 --> 30:56.259
I'm the only nigga in
town carrying everything,

30:56.294 --> 30:58.711
including your precious Suboxone.

30:58.763 --> 31:02.632
So, in a weird way, I
should be thanking you.

31:02.684 --> 31:04.216
You brought her to me.

31:04.269 --> 31:07.219
Your star orbiting with
mine, gravitationally,

31:07.272 --> 31:10.640
brought me the love of my life, Elliot.

31:10.692 --> 31:12.558
I mean, this, us?

31:12.610 --> 31:14.393
Being here?

31:14.445 --> 31:16.729
This has...

31:16.781 --> 31:19.198
beautiful meaning.

31:19.233 --> 31:22.902
But make no mistake, that girl in there...

31:22.954 --> 31:25.221
is mine.

31:25.256 --> 31:27.890
I don't know what I'd do without her.

31:27.925 --> 31:30.426
Now, I don't know what kind of arrangement

31:30.461 --> 31:36.098
you had with her before,
but now that we friends...

31:36.134 --> 31:38.901
I trust you respect this boundary.

31:38.936 --> 31:40.936
Feel me?

31:48.579 --> 31:50.846
[chuckles]

31:50.898 --> 31:53.733
A dude earlier today
gave me that same look.

31:53.768 --> 31:55.901
Only thing I gotta say is,

31:55.937 --> 31:58.654
there's a smart time to be scared, bro...

32:00.825 --> 32:02.825
And a stupid time.

32:03.928 --> 32:05.494
[door closes]

32:08.499 --> 32:09.832
Shayla?

32:09.867 --> 32:11.283
(Elliot voice-over) The lock pick.

32:11.336 --> 32:12.868
Every hacker's favorite sport.

32:12.920 --> 32:14.286
The perfect system to crack,

32:14.339 --> 32:16.288
mostly because unlike virtual systems,

32:16.341 --> 32:18.207
when you break it, you can feel it.

32:18.259 --> 32:19.675
You can see it. You can hear it.

32:19.711 --> 32:21.010
[metal clatters]

32:26.134 --> 32:29.969
Shayla.

32:30.021 --> 32:31.437
Hey.

32:31.472 --> 32:32.972
Shayla.

32:33.024 --> 32:35.725
Wake up.

32:35.777 --> 32:38.477
Mm.

32:38.529 --> 32:41.113
What happened?

32:41.149 --> 32:44.200
You okay?

32:44.235 --> 32:46.369
Why was that asshole here?

32:46.404 --> 32:48.237
Why am I in the tub?

32:52.619 --> 32:55.588
(Shayla) I don't know, um...
I told him I needed your pills.

32:55.623 --> 32:59.892
He came over. We smoked a little.

33:00.727 --> 33:02.427
You remember having sex with him?

33:02.462 --> 33:05.864
What? No.

33:05.899 --> 33:07.465
(Elliot voice-over)
But he definitely does.

33:07.501 --> 33:08.800
Okay, let's go.

33:08.835 --> 33:10.869
- Get your purse, make sure...
- Stop.

33:10.904 --> 33:14.472
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

33:14.508 --> 33:15.941
What do you mean?

33:15.976 --> 33:18.076
Oh, he's just gonna get away with it?

33:20.080 --> 33:21.913
You can't go back to him.
Hey, I don't need the pills.

33:21.949 --> 33:24.950
- Just find someone else.
- I can't.

33:28.789 --> 33:32.657
He gives me a really
good deal on the split.

33:32.693 --> 33:34.492
I make good money.

33:34.528 --> 33:36.294
(Elliot voice-over) There it is again,

33:36.330 --> 33:38.296
the invisible hand at work, controlling us,

33:38.332 --> 33:41.299
even if it pushes us past
our threshold of pain.

33:41.335 --> 33:44.502
It's not gonna stop.

33:44.538 --> 33:46.471
What if he does it again?

33:46.506 --> 33:50.075
Promise me you won't do anything?

33:50.110 --> 33:52.077
I'm serious, Elliot.

33:52.112 --> 33:55.080
There's nothing to be done here.

33:55.115 --> 33:57.382
It's not like I have a choice.

33:59.219 --> 34:00.518
Hey...

34:00.554 --> 34:03.455
Would you mind sleeping here tonight?

34:08.061 --> 34:09.828
(Elliot voice-over) Choices.

34:09.862 --> 34:12.097
Maybe Mr. Robot's right.

34:12.132 --> 34:16.167
That's what this is all about,
the yesses and nos of life.

34:16.203 --> 34:19.871
But do we decide them or do they decide us?

34:19.906 --> 34:22.206
Fernando Vera. I get rid of him,

34:22.242 --> 34:24.376
I get rid of my drug dealer's supplier.

34:24.411 --> 34:26.177
I get rid of the morphine.

34:26.213 --> 34:29.647
And the pain I've been
holding in comes rushing out.

34:29.683 --> 34:31.483
Sure, I can try to find another dealer,

34:31.485 --> 34:34.518
but like Vera said, no one
on the streets deals Suboxone.

34:34.554 --> 34:36.955
I could go back to digitally
counterfeiting scripts,

34:36.989 --> 34:39.991
but pharmas spend a lot of
dough protecting their wares.

34:39.993 --> 34:42.327
Most places only take paper scripts.

34:42.379 --> 34:44.795
Continuously getting legit
refills isn't realistic,

34:44.831 --> 34:46.831
and neither is being a junkie.

34:46.882 --> 34:50.885
So I quit cold turkey or let Vera exist.

34:50.920 --> 34:53.838
I know what you're thinking.
The answer's too obvious.

34:53.889 --> 34:56.341
Vera may have been groping Shayla before,

34:56.393 --> 34:58.259
but he's graduated to rape.

35:01.932 --> 35:05.517
Just like Shayla, he's left me no choice.

35:05.519 --> 35:08.520
He can't be allowed to exist anymore.

35:20.534 --> 35:24.536
(Krista) Perhaps we should
start with how you're feeling.

35:27.924 --> 35:30.708
Not good.

35:30.761 --> 35:34.679
What's not good right now?

35:34.714 --> 35:35.880
Everything.

35:37.884 --> 35:40.769
Humor me with some specifics.

35:45.442 --> 35:51.029
How do we know if we're in control?

35:51.064 --> 35:54.199
That we're not just making the best

35:54.234 --> 35:57.235
of what comes at us, and that's it.

35:57.287 --> 36:01.372
Trying to constantly
pick between two options.

36:01.408 --> 36:05.293
Like your two paintings
in the waiting room.

36:05.328 --> 36:09.747
Or... Coke and Pepsi.

36:09.749 --> 36:12.884
McDonald's or Burger King?

36:12.919 --> 36:17.889
Hyundai or Honda?

36:17.924 --> 36:20.925
Hmm.

36:20.927 --> 36:25.396
It's all part of the same blur, right?

36:25.432 --> 36:28.433
Just out of focus enough.

36:28.468 --> 36:30.969
It's the illusion of choice.

36:31.004 --> 36:34.172
Half of us can't even pick our own...

36:34.207 --> 36:37.575
our cable, gas, electric.

36:37.611 --> 36:41.996
The water we drink, our health insurance.

36:42.032 --> 36:45.283
Even if we did, would it matter?

36:45.285 --> 36:48.620
You know, if our only option
is Blue Cross or Blue Shield,

36:48.672 --> 36:51.589
what the fuck is the difference?

36:51.625 --> 36:53.625
[indistinct radio chatter]

36:56.463 --> 37:01.099
In fact, aren't they...
aren't they the same?

37:01.134 --> 37:03.184
No, man...

37:03.220 --> 37:07.105
our choices are prepaid for us,

37:07.140 --> 37:10.441
long time ago.

37:10.477 --> 37:13.478
I'm sorry you feel you have no control.

37:15.482 --> 37:20.985
Thought I was doing something good.

37:21.037 --> 37:25.456
I was a part of this... project.

37:25.492 --> 37:29.327
Thought I was going to be
a part of something special.

37:33.917 --> 37:38.670
- And now?
- Now...

37:38.722 --> 37:41.339
It turned out to be a mistake,

37:41.341 --> 37:43.725
like everything else.

37:43.760 --> 37:48.646
What's the point, right?

37:48.682 --> 37:51.983
Might as well, just... you do nothing.

37:52.018 --> 37:55.653
Might as well do nothing.

37:55.689 --> 37:57.655
You've brought up this issue before,

37:57.691 --> 38:00.658
this issue of not feeling
like you're in control.

38:00.694 --> 38:02.694
Do you remember?

38:05.582 --> 38:08.366
When we spoke about your father.

38:08.368 --> 38:10.868
You talked about how he chose to do nothing

38:10.870 --> 38:13.538
when he was battling his cancer.

38:13.540 --> 38:15.089
You told him he could have

38:15.125 --> 38:16.674
fought the company that caused it.
