WEBVTT

00:19.062 --> 00:20.150
[car engine starts]

00:20.194 --> 00:21.543
Hey!

00:23.632 --> 00:25.764
Get a room!

00:25.808 --> 00:27.897
Sorry!

00:27.940 --> 00:29.420
Jerk!

00:30.769 --> 00:32.510
My hero.

00:35.731 --> 00:37.950
We should get back
to the party.

00:37.994 --> 00:40.997
Yeah, okay.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.259
[chuckles]

00:45.175 --> 00:46.698
So, how long
have we been gone?

00:46.742 --> 00:50.006
Um, I don't know.
Time kind of stopped.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.573
Are you being serious?

00:51.616 --> 00:52.748
Totally. My sincerity

00:52.791 --> 00:55.011
and sarcasm sound
shockingly similar.

00:56.969 --> 00:58.145
Oh!
[chuckles]

00:58.188 --> 00:59.885
That's what it takes?

00:59.929 --> 01:02.714
I've been trying to get a laugh
out of you all night.

01:02.758 --> 01:05.935
So, uh, that's what you've been
going for, huh?

01:05.978 --> 01:07.545
Yeah. What is this?

01:07.589 --> 01:08.590
Motor oil?

01:08.633 --> 01:10.113
I think this
car's leaking.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.333
Let me turn it on. Okay.

01:14.117 --> 01:15.162
It's not oil.

01:15.205 --> 01:17.860
Jason, what is it?

01:51.198 --> 01:54.462
REPORTER:
Big cutbacks in federal spending
is the hot topic

01:54.505 --> 01:55.985
on Capitol Hill this week,

01:56.028 --> 01:58.379
with legislators vowing to trim
the federal budget

01:58.422 --> 02:01.077
While spending and staffing
cutbacks are likely

02:01.121 --> 02:02.034
at many federal agencies...

02:04.385 --> 02:06.822
McGee, I was watching that!

02:06.865 --> 02:09.303
Not anymore.
Time to hit the showers.

02:09.346 --> 02:11.305
Is your shower not working?

02:11.348 --> 02:13.350
Why, do I smell?

02:13.394 --> 02:15.265
I cannot smell you from there.

02:15.309 --> 02:16.614
And you're part bloodhound.

02:18.660 --> 02:19.617
Come closer.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.796
[sniffs]

02:24.840 --> 02:28.409
The answer is Drakkar Noir,
vintage 1988.

02:28.452 --> 02:29.627
He buys it
off e-Bay.

02:29.671 --> 02:31.629
Never forget your first love.

02:31.673 --> 02:32.804
You smell fine, McGee.

02:32.848 --> 02:34.066
Thank you, Ziva.

02:34.110 --> 02:35.633
Like lilacs.

02:35.677 --> 02:37.592
A masculine lilac, I'm sure.

02:37.635 --> 02:38.941
The kind that storms beachheads,

02:38.984 --> 02:41.987
likes bloody steaks
and smacks girls' bottoms.

02:42.031 --> 02:43.815
McGee's shower's broken.

02:43.859 --> 02:45.513
No, it's not.

02:45.556 --> 02:48.211
They said it was late
and it's time to...

02:48.255 --> 02:48.951
...hit the showers.

02:48.994 --> 02:50.257
Yeah.

02:50.300 --> 02:53.477
Oh! It's an expression!

02:53.521 --> 02:56.524
Ah. But hitting things
does fix things.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.352
Only according to Gibbs,
the Fonz

02:58.395 --> 02:59.657
and the far-too short-lived

02:59.701 --> 03:02.182
Stephen J. Cannell classic
Riptide.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.272
[sniffs]
Did you shower today?

03:05.315 --> 03:07.187
No.
You should.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.580
I shower
three times a week
like Brad Pitt.

03:09.624 --> 03:11.800
Preserves my
natural aroma.

03:11.843 --> 03:13.410
Boy, Director Vance
wasn't kidding

03:13.454 --> 03:14.542
about making changes.

03:14.585 --> 03:17.109
ZIVA:
We are gonna lose some people.

03:17.153 --> 03:18.198
We already have.

03:19.764 --> 03:21.157
NCIS investigative assistant

03:21.201 --> 03:22.985
found dead in the garage.

03:23.028 --> 03:24.682
Good, you got your gear.
Come on. Let's go.

03:28.643 --> 03:30.558
Somebody stinks.

03:33.082 --> 03:35.563
McGEE: Leo's bagged
the guy's personal effects.

03:35.606 --> 03:39.393
Temporary NCIS I.D. says
"Oliver Froman."

03:39.436 --> 03:41.612
Procurement Fraud Division hire.

03:41.656 --> 03:44.311
Hired a few months ago.
Just let go.

03:44.354 --> 03:47.836
Is Terry Thomas still supervisor
at the Fraud Squad?

03:47.879 --> 03:50.969
Uh-huh. That'll be
a fun interview, huh?

03:51.013 --> 03:54.190
No surveillance cameras,
no line of sight

03:54.234 --> 03:55.235
from adjacent buildings.

03:55.278 --> 03:57.541
Ducky, can we move
the body yet?

03:57.585 --> 03:59.108
No, no yet.

03:59.151 --> 04:01.980
Mr. Palmer,
I know local law
enforcement managed

04:02.024 --> 04:03.678
to reach the
man's pockets,

04:03.721 --> 04:05.288
but we can wait.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.856
Almost got it.

04:07.899 --> 04:09.597
I've got the liver probe
and, uh...

04:09.640 --> 04:12.077
Oh, yeah,

04:12.121 --> 04:13.296
I'm stuck.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.341
[sighs]

04:14.384 --> 04:16.125
Agent McGee, how soon

04:16.168 --> 04:17.474
can we move
this poor fellow's car?

04:20.347 --> 04:21.173
[grunting]

04:23.959 --> 04:26.178
Um, this is not his car.

04:26.222 --> 04:28.442
Don't rush on my account!
I'm fine, I'm fine!

04:28.485 --> 04:29.747
[sighs]

04:29.791 --> 04:31.967
I'm fine.I'll get the jack.

04:32.010 --> 04:34.448
Thank you! [grunts]

04:34.491 --> 04:36.972
So exactly what happened?

04:37.015 --> 04:38.626
Um, well, we were at
Paul's birthday party

04:38.669 --> 04:40.454
at the, uh,
at the pizza place.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.543
And me and Lauren
took a step outside

04:42.586 --> 04:44.240
to get some
fresh air.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.851
And she's making fun
of me 'cause I watch
Victorious

04:46.895 --> 04:48.505
on Nickelodeon.

04:48.549 --> 04:50.507
But Victoria Justice is hot,
right?

04:50.551 --> 04:51.639
So I said that.

04:51.682 --> 04:53.293
She got this
crinkly face.

04:53.336 --> 04:56.383
Then I said,
"But not as hot as you."

04:56.426 --> 04:59.690
And then she smiled,
and I planted one
on her.

04:59.734 --> 05:01.344
And, uh, and there was tongue.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.564
About the body, kid?

05:03.607 --> 05:05.609
Oh, her, her body was slamming.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.394
The dead body?

05:07.437 --> 05:11.441
Uh, yeah, that kind of sucked
because it was my first kiss.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.487
They get better.

05:15.967 --> 05:18.753
JIMMY:
Well, usually in the morning,
always after work.

05:18.796 --> 05:20.885
Then sometimes in the afternoon,

05:20.929 --> 05:22.409
depending on
what we're working on.

05:22.452 --> 05:25.586
I don't know.
I guess I'd say I shower

05:25.629 --> 05:26.978
about 18, 19
times a week.

05:27.022 --> 05:29.416
Surprised you have
any skin left.

05:29.459 --> 05:31.287
[chuckles]
What do you say, Doctor?

05:31.331 --> 05:35.160
I'd say the cause of death
is likely massive blood loss

05:35.204 --> 05:38.512
from multiple stab wounds
to the abdomen,

05:38.555 --> 05:40.818
and the time of death,
roughly two hours ago.

05:40.862 --> 05:42.864
Corresponds
with the gate ticket.

05:42.907 --> 05:44.648
Time-stamped at 7:55 p.m.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.084
So he diddrive in.

05:46.128 --> 05:48.652
ZIVA:
Just not in this car.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.828
Let's go hunting, McGee.

05:52.482 --> 05:53.614
What about you, David?

05:53.657 --> 05:55.703
When do you feel like showering?

05:55.746 --> 05:57.705
After just about any
conversation with you, Tony.

05:57.748 --> 05:58.619
[chuckles]

06:00.403 --> 06:02.231
I used to shower
in the mornings,

06:02.274 --> 06:04.276
but when I'd leave
the house with wet hair

06:04.320 --> 06:06.975
and it was cold outside,
I'd get a stiff neck.

06:07.018 --> 06:08.759
Apparently, that's not
just an old wive's tale.

06:08.803 --> 06:10.892
Then I started
blow-drying,

06:10.935 --> 06:13.982
but Tony would notice
I was using a hair dryer,

06:14.025 --> 06:16.027
and he wouldn't let me
hear the end of it.

06:16.071 --> 06:17.115
Of course...

06:17.159 --> 06:19.988
That was the
end of it.

06:20.031 --> 06:22.425
[keyless entry remote chirps]

06:27.865 --> 06:30.781
Looks like he
packed everything
he owns in here.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.392
Froman was on the move.

06:32.435 --> 06:35.046
He lost his job
and he hit the road.

06:35.090 --> 06:37.962
Yeah, with all
his meager possessions.

06:39.486 --> 06:40.878
Well, these aren't his.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.407
These are NCIS
property tags.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.626
All this stuff
was seized.

06:49.670 --> 06:52.020
This guy was looting
the office.

06:59.549 --> 07:02.509
[stuttering]:
Froman was last hired,
so f-first fired.

07:02.552 --> 07:03.684
It wasn't personal.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.468
Bet it felt
personal to him.

07:05.512 --> 07:08.253
Every department's g-getting
sh-shaved back.

07:08.297 --> 07:10.255
You know, h-he was one
of the first temporary hires.

07:10.299 --> 07:13.607
He knew that, b-but nobody
liked b-being let go.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.913
It's a horrible feeling.

07:15.957 --> 07:17.001
You have been
through it yourself?

07:17.045 --> 07:20.831
I was a c-c-customer
service r-rep.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.399
I answered phones
b-before NCIS.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.922
Wow. And they fired you?

07:24.966 --> 07:28.360
Yeah.
W-With no explanation.

07:28.404 --> 07:30.885
Gibbs, Terry Thomas.

07:30.928 --> 07:31.799
He was, uh, Froman's boss.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.759
Got Froman's computer.
Hard drive's been wiped.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.195
But I'm gonna take it
downstairs,

07:37.239 --> 07:40.242
see what kind of
security breach
Froman might be.

07:40.285 --> 07:41.417
He had a-a-access

07:41.461 --> 07:42.766
to a-active cases

07:42.810 --> 07:45.726
we were in the p-process,

07:45.769 --> 07:47.336
-pprocess
of p-prosecuting.

07:47.379 --> 07:49.512
Notice?

07:49.556 --> 07:51.862
G-Gave him two weeks.

07:51.906 --> 07:53.516
He picked up
his final paycheck Friday.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.300
He was just supposed
to be a temp.

07:55.344 --> 07:56.954
McGEE: But one case
was lingering.

07:56.998 --> 07:58.042
B-B-Big case.

07:58.086 --> 07:59.261
Lot of seized property.

07:59.304 --> 08:00.567
P-Prepping for auction.

08:00.610 --> 08:01.872
Who?

08:01.916 --> 08:03.134
Leona Phelps.

08:03.178 --> 08:04.658
Go.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.663
[scoffs] You know, h-he'd be
terrible at customer service.

08:11.403 --> 08:12.883
TONY:
Liver?

08:12.927 --> 08:14.537
Spleen.
Of course.

08:14.581 --> 08:15.495
Interest?

08:15.538 --> 08:16.539
Psycho.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.498
Aren't they all?

08:18.541 --> 08:20.587
The movie, Palmer.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.806
Disgruntled employee

08:22.850 --> 08:24.982
steals from the office
on the way out of town.

08:25.026 --> 08:27.507
Stops for a little
while and winds up dead

08:27.550 --> 08:28.769
just like Marian Crane
in Psycho.

08:28.812 --> 08:31.249
Spoiler alert, okay?
Haven't seen it.

08:31.293 --> 08:33.774
You've had 50 years to catch up
on the story of Norman Bates.

08:33.817 --> 08:36.646
The character inspired
by the exploits

08:36.690 --> 08:39.823
of the Wisconsin cannibal
Ed Gein.

08:39.867 --> 08:40.868
Yeah, that's
right, Duckman.

08:40.911 --> 08:43.261
The unassuming Gein
was known

08:43.305 --> 08:44.524
to give gifts

08:44.567 --> 08:46.308
to his neighbors
of smoked venison

08:46.351 --> 08:48.440
that he prepared himself.

08:48.484 --> 08:51.269
When the authorities
finally tracked him down,

08:51.313 --> 08:55.796
they found his smokehouse
filled with human body parts.

08:55.839 --> 08:58.625
Gein was said
to have remarked,

08:58.668 --> 09:01.584
"I never killed a deer
in my life."

09:01.628 --> 09:04.152
Oh! That's gross!

09:05.632 --> 09:06.197
Kidney?

09:06.241 --> 09:07.590
Liver.

09:07.634 --> 09:08.591
And this is perforated

09:08.635 --> 09:11.028
in an upward direction.

09:11.072 --> 09:13.335
The killer is
likely right-handed.

09:13.378 --> 09:15.163
13 stab wounds in total.

09:15.206 --> 09:17.208
And judging by the angle
of the incision,

09:17.252 --> 09:20.081
he or she knows how
to handle a blade.

09:20.124 --> 09:23.606
He didn't used amateurish
downward stabs

09:23.650 --> 09:26.870
like the fictional Bates
in the shower scene...

09:26.914 --> 09:28.350
Hey-hey-hey!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

09:28.393 --> 09:31.179
That short knife,
narrow blade.

09:31.222 --> 09:34.182
...but repeated, rapid,
upward thrusts.

09:36.401 --> 09:37.664
[knocking]

09:37.707 --> 09:38.839
Yep.

09:43.452 --> 09:45.019
You knocked.

09:45.062 --> 09:47.499
Trying to stay on
your good side.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.153
What, is that so hard?

09:49.197 --> 09:52.026
Well, has been lately.

09:52.069 --> 09:54.811
You have an update
on the assistant?

09:54.855 --> 09:56.465
He helped himself to property

09:56.508 --> 09:57.814
he was supposed
to be processing,

09:57.858 --> 09:59.511
including Leona Phelps.

09:59.555 --> 10:02.776
Leona Phelps is considered
the Madoff of the Navy.

10:02.819 --> 10:05.039
She ran the National Armed
Forces Credit Union

10:05.082 --> 10:06.954
till she segued
to the private sector.

10:06.997 --> 10:09.260
She built what
basically turned out

10:09.304 --> 10:11.001
to be a financial house
of cards.

10:11.045 --> 10:12.960
NCIS took her down
last year.

10:13.003 --> 10:16.659
Yeah, minimum sentence
at a country club.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.400
The least of the charges.

10:18.443 --> 10:20.750
She's left behind a trail
of broken lives,

10:20.794 --> 10:22.056
but so far, none of the billions

10:22.099 --> 10:23.884
that she was responsible
for investing.

10:23.927 --> 10:26.103
She's appealing
her conviction.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.845
Nothing disrupts
that prosecution, Gibbs.

10:28.889 --> 10:31.108
What about the scene?

10:31.152 --> 10:32.675
Time stamp says he pulled in

10:32.719 --> 10:35.069
20 minutes before.
Parked,

10:35.112 --> 10:36.374
he walked down two levels.

10:36.418 --> 10:37.811
He got slashed deeper
than your budget there.

10:37.854 --> 10:39.726
Duck said
lividity shows that

10:39.769 --> 10:41.902
he was dead before he was
stuffed underneath the car.

10:41.945 --> 10:45.079
Do you think this could be a
case of wrong place, wrong time?

10:45.122 --> 10:47.385
I'll let you know.

10:49.387 --> 10:53.565
Leon, any of these personal
decisions affect my team?

10:53.609 --> 10:55.785
I'll let you know.

10:59.397 --> 11:01.965
Hear me now?

11:02.009 --> 11:03.663
Sorry. Had to drop you
at Security.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.708
No, I'm at the Home Office.

11:05.752 --> 11:08.276
It looks exactly
the same, actually...

11:08.319 --> 11:09.843
TONY:
Maybe our dead guy was
running from something,

11:09.886 --> 11:11.409
maybe he was running
to something.

11:11.453 --> 11:13.716
But if the guy was leaving
town, then where was he going?

11:13.760 --> 11:14.891
Closest family members

11:14.935 --> 11:16.719
are cousins on
his mother's side.

11:16.763 --> 11:17.894
They live in
Topeka, Kansas.

11:17.938 --> 11:18.982
You don't go

11:19.026 --> 11:21.028
see family after
losing your job

11:21.071 --> 11:22.856
and pulling the plug on
your big city adventure.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.466
[laughs]

11:24.509 --> 11:26.424
Working for NCIS is
a "big-city adventure"?

11:26.468 --> 11:29.079
I'll find someplace
to stay.

11:29.123 --> 11:30.559
As long as it's comfortable.

11:30.602 --> 11:33.301
Where do you go?

11:33.344 --> 11:34.650
Open road?

11:34.694 --> 11:36.304
With a trunkful of stolen goods.

11:36.347 --> 11:37.958
TONY:
Friend's place, then.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.786
ZIVA:
I pulled phone logs
from his office

11:39.829 --> 11:41.744
and his personal cell. Nothing.
He would call ahead.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.398
Not if you want
to surprise them.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.403
BARRETT:
All right, call me later.
You, too.

11:48.446 --> 11:50.840
TONY:
What kind of friends?
They have a criminal record?

11:50.884 --> 11:55.497
You can't have a criminal record
and work for us.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.325
And you.

11:57.368 --> 11:58.892
Work for us?

11:58.935 --> 12:01.633
For NCIS? E.J. Barrett.

12:01.677 --> 12:03.374
Tony DiNozzo.

12:07.248 --> 12:08.815
Ziva David.

12:08.858 --> 12:09.990
Uh, you work in this office?

12:10.033 --> 12:11.687
I think this is
my desk right here.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.820
Hey, let me ask you:

12:13.863 --> 12:15.822
does the glare from
that skylight bug you?

12:15.865 --> 12:18.520
'Cause it's a lot
of light, and...

12:18.563 --> 12:19.695
[drawer slams]

12:19.739 --> 12:21.262
Is this thing bolted?

12:21.305 --> 12:22.872
[drawer slams again]

12:22.916 --> 12:24.787
I want my desk this way,
which would...

12:24.831 --> 12:26.833
You know, how about if we,
uh... we go ask

12:26.876 --> 12:28.486
Abby and McGee if they
want to track down...

12:28.530 --> 12:29.444
Let's take
the stairs.

12:29.487 --> 12:30.837
[muttering]

12:30.880 --> 12:34.318
Come on. Let's get some air.

12:34.362 --> 12:36.756
It's leather, McGee.
It's leather fiber.

12:36.799 --> 12:39.367
Leather is skin.

12:39.410 --> 12:40.760
I try not to
think about that.

12:40.803 --> 12:43.240
It's flesh.

12:43.284 --> 12:45.808
It's tanned,
stretched, processed,

12:45.852 --> 12:47.157
dyed, dead flesh.

12:47.201 --> 12:48.811
You're making it hard
not to think about.

12:48.855 --> 12:51.161
ABBY:
You know, there's a wide range
of leathers

12:51.205 --> 12:54.164
other than your typical
moo-based ones.

12:54.208 --> 12:56.819
There's pig leather,
and there's sheep leather,

12:56.863 --> 12:58.516
and there's goat leather.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.476
And then there's chamois,
and your high-end exotics,

13:01.519 --> 13:03.043
like lizard and ostrich

13:03.086 --> 13:04.348
and hippo...

13:04.392 --> 13:06.133
Aw... hippo.

13:06.176 --> 13:08.222
Abby. Do you want me
to stop digging through

13:08.265 --> 13:10.137
Froman's computer and
pay attention to you?
Please.

13:10.180 --> 13:12.617
Okay. I'm trying to
isolate the DNA

13:12.661 --> 13:14.358
from the fibers Ziva collected
underneath the car.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.839
Why would you want to get
the DNA of that fiber?

13:16.883 --> 13:19.929
There were no fingerprints
at the crime scene, McGee.

13:19.973 --> 13:21.670
There were no fingerprints
on the crime victim.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.237
There were no fingerprints
on this gum wrapper.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.760
The attacker wore gloves.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.850
Leather gloves.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.504
TONY:
No, I saw what happened.

13:29.547 --> 13:31.027
You and me are having
a conversation,

13:31.071 --> 13:32.289
we're trying to
work something out...

13:32.333 --> 13:33.856
Yeah, it is a violation.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.945
There is an expectation of
privacy in our own office.

13:35.989 --> 13:37.817
And she's just chatting away.
She's right over the hedge.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.296
It is over the edge!

13:39.340 --> 13:40.515
Actually, it's
"over the top,"

13:40.558 --> 13:42.343
but it's pushing you
over the edge.
Huh?

13:42.386 --> 13:44.693
And you know
what I think?
McGEE:
...forget trying it on.

13:44.736 --> 13:46.651
TONY:
What are you guys talking about?

13:46.695 --> 13:48.523
Um...

13:48.566 --> 13:50.264
Tanning hides.
You?

13:50.307 --> 13:51.439
The same.

13:51.482 --> 13:53.528
Easy.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.399
So you think our psycho's
got a flesh collection?

13:55.443 --> 13:56.836
Think he's got
a pair of gloves?

13:57.924 --> 13:59.055
[computer chimes]

13:59.099 --> 14:01.275
Finally. All right, I am in.

14:01.318 --> 14:03.146
Let's see what Froman was up to.

14:03.190 --> 14:05.105
McGEE:
Ooh. We did not
find that.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.631
According to his history,
Froman printed out

14:09.674 --> 14:13.591
the specs for a warehouse
earmarked for the Phelps case.

14:13.635 --> 14:16.943
Her entire estate was deemed the
result of a criminal enterprise.

14:16.986 --> 14:19.902
Rather than secure her 400-acre
residence in Virginia,

14:19.946 --> 14:22.252
NCIS took possession
of all her possessions.

14:22.296 --> 14:24.646
And relocated them
to a secure warehouse.

14:24.689 --> 14:26.343
Well, this is a location,

14:26.387 --> 14:28.824
guard schedules,
security codes,
and inventory.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.783
These printouts were nowhere
in the items we recovered.

14:31.827 --> 14:34.308
If Froman was selling details

14:34.351 --> 14:36.136
on how to rob
the entire warehouse,

14:36.179 --> 14:37.964
and the buyer killed him
rather than pay him...

14:38.007 --> 14:39.922
Then we're not looking
for a psycho.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.881
We're looking for a crew.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.360
There's gonna be a heist.

14:51.760 --> 14:54.589
McGEE:
Leona Phelps preyed on
active and retired sailors.

14:54.632 --> 14:56.765
She lost billions
of investor dollars

14:56.808 --> 14:58.071
through various shell
corporations and ponzi schemes,

14:58.114 --> 15:01.639
while amassing
a vast personal fortune.

15:01.683 --> 15:04.860
NCIS confiscated and relocated
all of Phelps' possessions

15:04.904 --> 15:07.080
to a warehouse
in Tysons Corner.

15:07.123 --> 15:09.952
Her artwork, jewelry,
furniture,

15:09.996 --> 15:11.780
and various collectibles

15:11.823 --> 15:13.434
would recover
75 million at auction.

15:13.477 --> 15:14.957
McGEE:
She was a notorious pack rat.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.567
Among other things.

15:16.611 --> 15:18.787
Froman had access
to the details?

15:18.830 --> 15:19.962
Possibly tried
to sell them.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.181
Like Heat.

15:21.224 --> 15:22.922
The movie,
the Michael Mann movie.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.053
Private security
on the warehouse?

15:24.097 --> 15:25.576
Yeah, we'll take over.

15:25.620 --> 15:26.621
Uh, we'll get the inventory.Take Ziva.

15:26.664 --> 15:27.752
McGEE:
Where we going, boss?

15:27.796 --> 15:29.972
Camp Cupcake.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.192
Gonna visit Ms. Phelps
in Alderson Prison?

15:32.235 --> 15:34.977
Schemer like her
was probably involved.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.805
E.J., L.J., uh...

15:36.848 --> 15:38.502
TONY:
Gibbs.

15:38.546 --> 15:39.982
TONY:
She's new.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.505
He's old.

15:41.549 --> 15:44.247
Wouldn't put it past her.
Robbing herself.

15:45.422 --> 15:48.643
You've met Phelps?Briefly.

15:48.686 --> 15:51.951
She was transferring operations
to Europe when my team

15:51.994 --> 15:53.604
brought her to
Director Vance's attention.

15:53.648 --> 15:55.215
You have a team?

15:55.258 --> 15:58.000
I'm team leader.
I have two other agents.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.871
We're transferring
here. To D.C.

15:59.915 --> 16:01.047
Where from?

16:01.090 --> 16:02.309
Spain.

16:02.352 --> 16:05.616
Rota, Spain.

16:05.660 --> 16:08.010
You mean
[rolling "R"s]:
Rota.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.316
[trying to roll "R"]:
Rota...

16:09.359 --> 16:10.534
Yeah. I could never do that.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.712
Inventory list.

16:14.756 --> 16:17.977
Yeah. Let's do it.

16:24.505 --> 16:27.943
WILSON:
Well, it's unassuming
from the outside, you know.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.640
Just an old warehouse.

16:29.684 --> 16:31.251
Built in the '70s, I think.

16:31.294 --> 16:32.513
Modern security
measures?

16:32.556 --> 16:34.036
Well, we got the place
wired with cameras.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.298
Keypad entry.

16:35.342 --> 16:38.301
Got these swipe cards here.

16:38.345 --> 16:40.303
Three-man teams.
Ha.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.044
Two men work,
one man naps.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.524
Oh, you know
the drill.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.482
But ain't nothing
gone missing.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.049
How would you know?
Place looks like Xanadu.

16:47.093 --> 16:50.226
Well, we ain't never had any
of these paintings come to life

16:50.270 --> 16:52.489
and jump out the frame.
[laughing]

16:52.533 --> 16:54.100
You referring to the
Olivia Newton-John movie?

16:54.143 --> 16:56.493
Weren't you?

16:56.537 --> 16:59.279
Xanadu.Uh...
Citizen Kane's house.

16:59.322 --> 17:01.150
Oh. That's
a little embarrassing.

17:01.194 --> 17:02.717
Yeah, for
both of you.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.719
But, uh, really, how would you
know if somebody took Rosebud

17:04.762 --> 17:05.807
out to go sledding?

17:05.850 --> 17:07.417
TONY:
Nice.

17:07.461 --> 17:08.984
Oh, hasn't been anyone
unauthorized in here.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.246
Save you two.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.292
I mean, this is a cush gig.

17:12.335 --> 17:13.858
None of us want to
mess with that.

17:13.902 --> 17:15.991
Tempting as it may be
to play with the toys.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.514
These are Steve McQueen's
sunglasses

17:17.558 --> 17:18.559
from The Thomas Crowne Affair.

17:18.602 --> 17:20.213
Now, that was a heist.

17:20.256 --> 17:22.693
[happy sigh]

17:22.737 --> 17:24.695
She can't be all bad.

17:24.739 --> 17:26.741
Mr. Wilson, we would like
to amplify your security,

17:26.784 --> 17:28.525
since your protection measures
may have been leaked.

17:28.569 --> 17:29.961
Y'all want to set up shop?

17:30.005 --> 17:31.267
Fine by me.

17:31.311 --> 17:32.790
Feel free to check
your list twice.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.575
Holler if you need anything.

17:34.618 --> 17:36.664
Mm-hmm. Thank you,
thank you.

17:36.707 --> 17:39.014
[awed whisper]:
Wow.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.886
TONY:
These thing sold at a European
action a few years ago

17:41.930 --> 17:43.453
for $70,000.

17:43.497 --> 17:44.802
That...

17:44.846 --> 17:46.239
is ridiculous.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.980
Yeah.

17:49.024 --> 17:51.418
I had the opportunity

17:51.461 --> 17:53.724
to transfer to Europe
a few years back.

17:53.768 --> 17:56.118
I've never heard
you say that.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.729
I heard Director Shepherd
offered you a team.

17:58.773 --> 18:00.731
So where was it, exactly?

18:00.775 --> 18:02.298
Spain.

18:02.342 --> 18:04.605
Rota, Spain.

18:07.999 --> 18:10.567
PHELPS:
You people better be
watching my things.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.047
PRISONER:
Little help, Leona?

18:15.703 --> 18:18.271
[sarcastically]:
Perfect.

18:18.314 --> 18:20.664
If I have to play another
damn volleyball game,

18:20.708 --> 18:22.318
I'm going to strangle someone.

18:22.362 --> 18:24.015
Well, that'd be good.

18:24.059 --> 18:26.757
Get you a nice room
in the supermax.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.368
Yet another cheap suit,

18:28.411 --> 18:31.240
hell-bent on railroading me
into a conviction.

18:31.284 --> 18:34.025
And they say money's
supposed to buy justice.

18:34.069 --> 18:37.028
It clearly can't buy class.

18:37.072 --> 18:40.031
Am I talking to you, or your
acid-tongued little errand boy?

18:40.075 --> 18:42.121
You know, you don't care
about any of the lives

18:42.164 --> 18:43.600
you've ruined.
McGee.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.957
Your things have been relocated.

18:53.001 --> 18:55.177
What?

18:55.221 --> 18:57.353
It's the first
you've heard of it?

18:57.397 --> 18:59.529
I'm locked in this hole.

18:59.573 --> 19:02.750
Your lawyers didn't tell you.

19:02.793 --> 19:05.796
At pushing five figures an hour,
I avoid small talk.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.842
with my defense team.

19:07.885 --> 19:10.584
That's tough.
Well running dry?

19:10.627 --> 19:11.933
I'll be fine.

19:11.976 --> 19:13.369
Sure.

19:13.413 --> 19:15.371
Billions unaccounted for.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.634
Investing carries
inherent risk.

19:17.678 --> 19:19.201
So does lying to
a federal agent.

19:19.245 --> 19:21.072
I didn't ask to talk
to you, Agent Gibbs.

19:21.116 --> 19:23.205
It was the other way around.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.381
And as charming and clever
as you may find yourself,

19:25.425 --> 19:26.817
it's not mutual, so get to it.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.390
[sighs]

19:34.434 --> 19:36.610
This is...

19:36.653 --> 19:40.527
is supposed to be
in the villa in Seville,

19:40.570 --> 19:43.660
and this is all my furniture.

19:43.704 --> 19:48.361
This is...

19:48.404 --> 19:51.712
This is...?

19:51.755 --> 19:54.236
Everything.

19:54.280 --> 19:58.849
We suspect that someone might
be trying to rob our facility.

19:58.893 --> 20:01.025
A heist.

20:01.069 --> 20:02.679
Who do you suspect?

20:02.723 --> 20:04.681
Oh, I don't know,
who do you suspect?

20:07.989 --> 20:10.034
I'll be late for
my pastry class.

20:10.078 --> 20:13.560
Martha Stewart started it
when she was here.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.257
Take care, Agent Gibbs.

20:20.306 --> 20:23.526
It's one of Tony's movie myths.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.963
I've never had a good time
in a women's prison.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.835
[disgusted sigh]
What a horrible woman.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.186
Video depositions.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.362
Everything we have
on her victims.

20:33.406 --> 20:35.146
Looking to put a face
to her crimes?

20:35.190 --> 20:37.366
Tony and Ziva?

20:37.410 --> 20:38.933
Said they plugged
the holes in

20:38.976 --> 20:41.152
the warehouse security system
with motion detectors.

20:41.196 --> 20:42.545
Monitoring now.

20:42.589 --> 20:44.547
Figure since this crew
left the body behind them,

20:44.591 --> 20:46.941
they'll probably strike quickly.

20:46.984 --> 20:49.378
Yep.

20:49.422 --> 20:51.337
Do you need any
help with the...

20:51.380 --> 20:54.644
I can play a DVD, McGee.

20:58.082 --> 20:59.519
MALE VOICE:
Navy Pension Fund deposition...

20:59.562 --> 21:00.955
McGEE:
It's really sad.

21:00.998 --> 21:03.653
A lot of hardworking people
forced out of retirement

21:03.697 --> 21:05.264
after having their
pensions depleted.

21:07.091 --> 21:08.745
WOMAN:
Grace Mullen.

21:08.789 --> 21:11.400
My husband Benjamin
and I were advised

21:11.444 --> 21:15.317
to move his Navy pension
to the Phelps Fund.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.754
That's all gone now.

21:17.798 --> 21:21.323
Ben managed to find work washing
floors at Lincoln School.

21:21.367 --> 21:24.457
He always kept a straight back.

21:24.500 --> 21:28.591
"I'm back swabbing
the decks on the Lincoln."

21:28.635 --> 21:29.766
He-- he joked about that.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.251
TONY [scoffs]:
Paintings come to life.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.644
Guy probably thinks he's like

21:37.687 --> 21:40.124
Ben Stiller in
Night at the Museum.

21:40.168 --> 21:42.431
He's playing baseball
with himself.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.955
He's a working stiff.

21:44.999 --> 21:46.740
No magic there.

21:46.783 --> 21:48.742
Fiddle Faddle?

21:48.785 --> 21:52.528
What?
You want
something to eat?
No.

21:52.572 --> 21:54.313
I have an apple
if you'd prefer.

21:54.356 --> 21:55.923
He's gotta have
dreams, right?

21:55.966 --> 21:57.272
He can't just go to work,

21:57.316 --> 21:59.361
punch the clock,
walk the beat,

21:59.405 --> 22:01.363
wake up, go back,

22:01.407 --> 22:03.147
do it all over again.

22:03.191 --> 22:05.149
Here.

22:05.193 --> 22:07.717
Why do you
keep pushing
food on me?

22:07.761 --> 22:09.719
Because your blood sugar
is dangerously low--

22:09.763 --> 22:11.112
unless something else
is bothering you.

22:14.681 --> 22:17.640
My name is Ruleo Medilla.

22:17.684 --> 22:20.556
I drove a sanitation truck
in Detroit

22:20.600 --> 22:23.559
before I took
partial disability.

22:30.610 --> 22:33.177
You need something, Barrett?

22:33.221 --> 22:35.441
No.

22:35.484 --> 22:38.052
You need anything, Gibbs?

22:41.838 --> 22:43.144
Night.

22:53.763 --> 22:56.113
[alarm beeping]

22:58.333 --> 22:59.639
Motion censor is tripped.

22:59.682 --> 23:00.944
Wilson, what's your 20:00?

23:00.988 --> 23:01.902
WILSON:
Uh, I'm at the guards office.

23:01.945 --> 23:04.034
You have any men
on the floor?

23:04.078 --> 23:05.035
Negative.

23:05.079 --> 23:05.949
We have visitors.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.670
False alarm, Wilson.

23:30.713 --> 23:32.062
WILSON:
Copy that.

23:32.106 --> 23:34.891
Hey, boss, couldn't call ahead?

23:34.935 --> 23:37.677
Nope. I came in
the way they came in.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.287
The heist
isn't coming.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.897
They pulled it
off already.

23:40.941 --> 23:43.030
What?

23:43.073 --> 23:44.466
Like a thief in the night?

23:44.510 --> 23:45.815
But nothing's missing.

23:45.859 --> 23:47.469
No. Nothing on this list.

23:47.513 --> 23:48.905
So what did they take?

23:48.949 --> 23:50.864
Phelps went
straight to this page.

23:54.389 --> 23:56.391
So something interested her
here, huh?

23:56.435 --> 23:59.133
Ah. There's a
couple options.

23:59.176 --> 24:01.440
I like this desk.

24:03.572 --> 24:05.748
It's old-growth wood.

24:05.792 --> 24:07.576
Craftsman laid.
[gasps]

24:07.620 --> 24:08.969
It belonged to William Faulkner.

24:09.012 --> 24:10.536
I love his
writing.

24:10.579 --> 24:11.754
TONY:
Total genius.

24:11.798 --> 24:13.539
Yes!

24:13.582 --> 24:16.367
It was worth learning
English just for The
Sound and the Fury.

24:16.411 --> 24:18.108
Or that chapter in
As I Lay Dying,

24:18.152 --> 24:20.023
you know, the one with
the five words where
Vardaman says,

24:20.067 --> 24:22.199
"My mother is a fish."

24:22.243 --> 24:24.201
I don't really like
his books that much,

24:24.245 --> 24:25.507
but I'm a big fan of the movies

24:25.551 --> 24:26.465
he made based
on other people's books,

24:26.508 --> 24:27.988
like The Big Sleep

24:28.031 --> 24:29.598
and To Have and Have Not.

24:29.642 --> 24:31.034
I mean he gave us
Bogey and Bacall.

24:31.078 --> 24:32.558
God bless you, William Faulkner.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.690
GIBBS: Dovetail joints
don't go with nails.

24:36.344 --> 24:37.519
They've been here.

24:37.563 --> 24:38.694
It's been jimmied.

24:38.738 --> 24:42.350
There's gotta be a
manual release somewhere.

24:45.005 --> 24:46.485
[secret door drops open]

24:46.528 --> 24:48.225
Huh.

24:50.097 --> 24:53.535
ZIVA:
They did not care
about this desk.

24:53.579 --> 24:56.320
No. Only what was in here.

24:56.364 --> 24:58.192
What was that?

25:05.852 --> 25:09.203
[Ziva grunting, desk clattering]

25:09.246 --> 25:11.161
[desk slamming]

25:11.205 --> 25:13.294
Hey, you brought me
a new desk.

25:13.337 --> 25:14.687
It's an old desk.

25:14.730 --> 25:16.950
Did you find anything on
your leather DNA project?

25:16.993 --> 25:19.213
Turns out it's impossible.

25:19.256 --> 25:20.997
It's improbable.
It's just highly unlikely.

25:21.041 --> 25:24.392
Can't really determine much
other than the type of cow.

25:24.435 --> 25:26.525
Oh, what is that
on the plasma?

25:26.568 --> 25:28.048
Oh, that's...
that's a different case.

25:28.091 --> 25:29.440
That's for Special
Agent Barrett.

25:29.484 --> 25:31.704
Have you met her? She talks
to herself all the time.

25:31.747 --> 25:33.314
It's weird.
You'll like it.

25:33.357 --> 25:37.405
Yeah. I do not like all the
shuffling of desks.

25:37.448 --> 25:39.929
You know what, evidence garage,
it's right over there.

25:39.973 --> 25:42.497
Huh.

25:42.541 --> 25:43.890
Careful.

25:43.933 --> 25:45.500
A man was killed for this.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.284
I thought he was killed for
what was inside of it.

25:47.328 --> 25:49.025
We do not even know
what that was.

25:49.069 --> 25:50.984
Challenge accepted.

25:51.027 --> 25:52.681
What kind of a cow?

25:52.725 --> 25:53.900
It's a calf.

25:53.943 --> 25:55.336
Holstein.

25:55.379 --> 25:56.424
ZIVA:
Ah.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.818
[door opening]

26:02.212 --> 26:03.823
Tacky , Agent Gibbs.

26:03.866 --> 26:06.608
I especially hate
the bracelets.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.610
Not your favorite jewelry.

26:10.394 --> 26:12.135
What do you want now?

26:14.529 --> 26:18.315
Secret panel
in your desk,
it was empty.

26:18.359 --> 26:22.624
Looks like it was pried open
with a screwdriver.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.626
I was robbed.

26:24.670 --> 26:28.195
Would you like to file a claim?

26:28.238 --> 26:29.762
Against you?

26:29.805 --> 26:31.720
For damages? Sure.

26:31.764 --> 26:34.201
No, for your loss.

26:34.244 --> 26:37.030
We'll need to know
what was in there.

26:37.073 --> 26:39.685
[inhaling]:
What's the theory?

26:39.728 --> 26:42.296
GIBBS:
Well, it must've been valuable.

26:42.339 --> 26:45.081
They went straight
for the desk.

26:45.125 --> 26:47.083
Didn't touch anything else.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.172
Maybe you arranged it yourself.

26:49.216 --> 26:52.654
[scoffs]
Interesting theory.

26:52.698 --> 26:54.438
It was yours.

26:54.482 --> 26:56.440
Two seconds into hearing
about the case,

26:56.484 --> 26:58.617
you jumped right to it.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.662
Broken clocks and
blind squirrels.

27:00.706 --> 27:01.881
Really?

27:01.924 --> 27:03.883
Just a lucky guess, huh?

27:03.926 --> 27:07.408
I'm still just getting
the lay of the land.

27:07.451 --> 27:10.019
Huh. Where'd you
find that chair?

27:10.063 --> 27:12.282
It was over there
in the corner.

27:14.589 --> 27:17.157
So what's your
quick read here?

27:17.200 --> 27:19.812
She hates feeling
like a prisoner,

27:19.855 --> 27:21.248
so Gibbs salts
the wound,

27:21.291 --> 27:23.685
keeps her emotional.
He stays cerebral.

27:23.729 --> 27:26.688
That's how you get
a captain's "C" on your jersey.

27:26.732 --> 27:29.038
You a jock, DiNozzo?

27:29.082 --> 27:30.561
Basketball.

27:30.605 --> 27:31.562
Some other stuff.

27:31.606 --> 27:33.652
Hmm. Varsity?

27:33.695 --> 27:35.828
Team captain.

27:35.871 --> 27:36.959
Once upon a time.

27:37.003 --> 27:38.178
Hmm.

27:38.221 --> 27:40.180
I was a cheerleader myself.

27:40.223 --> 27:41.442
Oh?

27:41.485 --> 27:42.704
Hmm.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.184
I never got past
JV, though.

27:44.227 --> 27:45.576
Kept getting distracted
by the boys.

27:45.620 --> 27:46.969
[chuckles]

27:47.013 --> 27:48.405
Oh.

27:48.449 --> 27:51.931
I got to run. I got a
meeting with the director.

27:51.974 --> 27:54.281
She'll want a deal.

27:57.066 --> 27:59.025
I know.

27:59.068 --> 28:01.767
What does he want?

28:01.810 --> 28:03.725
Anybody else know
about the panel?

28:03.769 --> 28:06.380
I had nothing to do
with this crime, Agent Gibbs.

28:06.423 --> 28:07.816
I'm the victim.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.731
However,
I can tell you

28:09.775 --> 28:13.126
exactly who
you're looking for.

28:13.169 --> 28:16.520
But you need to do something
for me.

28:18.653 --> 28:21.787
[clattering on table]

28:21.830 --> 28:24.659
When they've got all the
information they can gather

28:24.703 --> 28:27.488
about the victim, I'd like him
to come back here with you.

28:27.531 --> 28:30.360
You been able to
find everything you...

28:36.410 --> 28:37.716
Thank you, EJ.

28:48.030 --> 28:49.597
That didn't last long.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.381
Knocking on my door.

28:51.425 --> 28:54.820
Leona Phelps wants
to cut a deal.

28:54.863 --> 28:55.995
Deal for what?

28:56.038 --> 28:57.953
The name of Froman's killer.

28:57.997 --> 29:00.477
She could have the name
of Jimmy Hoffa's killer.

29:00.521 --> 29:02.218
There's no way we're going to
reduce the charges against her.

29:02.262 --> 29:04.133
No, that's not
what she asked for.

29:04.177 --> 29:05.613
Then what does
she want?

29:05.656 --> 29:06.614
Get out of prison.

29:06.657 --> 29:08.050
No.

29:08.094 --> 29:10.966
House arrest,
pending her appeal.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.359
She knows who targeted her.

29:12.402 --> 29:15.188
You don't make deals, Gibbs.

29:15.231 --> 29:18.104
This one's a steal.

29:20.584 --> 29:23.457
Using the few clues
from the garage murder

29:23.500 --> 29:25.241
and the warehouse
break-in,

29:25.285 --> 29:27.766
I focused on substantial
unsolved heists in the area,

29:27.809 --> 29:28.941
over the past ten years.

29:28.984 --> 29:30.986
Here's what I found.

29:31.030 --> 29:33.597
Six years ago,
casino cage,

29:33.641 --> 29:34.773
Atlantic City.

29:34.816 --> 29:36.862
Two-man team goes
in with hot iron.

29:36.905 --> 29:39.081
Three guards get bloody.
One gets aced.

29:39.125 --> 29:41.997
Stick up man goes
toes-up on the carpet.

29:42.041 --> 29:45.261
The other goes out the door
with 27 million clams.

29:45.305 --> 29:46.785
Getaway driver

29:46.828 --> 29:49.091
scoops him curbside,
guns blazing.

29:49.135 --> 29:51.572
They dump and burn the ride
on the Jersey border.

29:51.615 --> 29:53.313
And then they are Casper.

29:53.356 --> 29:54.967
All right, McGem City,
where does that get us, huh?

29:55.010 --> 29:56.490
Unless you built a proton pack

29:56.533 --> 29:58.492
in your spare time,
we can't bust ghosts, so...

30:00.015 --> 30:02.757
The guy they left behind
has a rap sheet

30:02.801 --> 30:04.019
as long as a...

30:04.063 --> 30:06.979
As long as a...

30:07.022 --> 30:08.894
What's really long?

30:08.937 --> 30:10.809
This presentation.

30:10.852 --> 30:13.724
The FBI tracked down
known associates

30:13.768 --> 30:15.683
of the dead guy
and they found nada.

30:15.726 --> 30:17.467
27 million, split two ways?

30:17.511 --> 30:19.469
That's "one last score"
kind of money. They're gone.

30:19.513 --> 30:21.080
White sand beaches
and umbrella drinks

30:21.123 --> 30:22.646
for the rest of your life.

30:22.690 --> 30:23.952
Who would come back
from that?

30:23.996 --> 30:25.736
That question has to
wait till we come back.

30:25.780 --> 30:28.914
Uh, boss, McGee thinks
he's got a lead on the crew.

30:28.957 --> 30:30.002
I got a quicker one.

30:30.045 --> 30:31.525
Ziva, let's go.

30:31.568 --> 30:32.526
Where we going?

30:32.569 --> 30:33.962
To spring Leona Phelps

30:34.006 --> 30:35.921
from Camp Cupcake.

30:35.964 --> 30:38.662
You made a deal with her?

30:52.763 --> 30:54.200
[sighs]

30:56.158 --> 30:57.986
You did quick work, Gibbs.

30:58.030 --> 30:59.074
Name.

30:59.118 --> 31:02.208
We met in 2005

31:02.251 --> 31:04.253
at my office at home

31:04.297 --> 31:06.125
to discuss a
business proposition.

31:06.168 --> 31:08.954
Among the many objet d'art,

31:08.997 --> 31:10.390
he was particularly
preoccupied

31:10.433 --> 31:11.913
with the Faulkner desk.

31:11.957 --> 31:13.828
Your favorite hiding place.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.309
Yes.

31:16.352 --> 31:18.267
His name is Otto Brackin.

31:19.660 --> 31:21.357
[speed-dials]

31:21.401 --> 31:22.793
[line ringing]

31:22.837 --> 31:24.404
McGee?

31:24.447 --> 31:26.319
GIBBS:
McGee, Otto Brackin.

31:26.362 --> 31:28.930
I know. Wait, how do you know?

31:28.974 --> 31:30.366
What do I know?

31:30.410 --> 31:31.759
Well, he was a cellmate
of the guy who died

31:31.802 --> 31:33.282
in the casino heist.

31:33.326 --> 31:34.805
They did a two-year stretch
together at Ossining.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.329
Where is he now?

31:36.372 --> 31:37.678
Virginia State Police
found his body

31:37.721 --> 31:39.375
a few hours ago.
He's dead.

31:52.345 --> 31:53.520
[clears throat]

31:53.563 --> 31:56.131
Virginia PD says
the motel room

31:56.175 --> 31:57.393
where they found
Otto Brackin's body

31:57.437 --> 31:58.873
was trashed.
Major struggle.

31:58.917 --> 32:02.529
So, lacerations
were on his liver?

32:02.572 --> 32:05.793
Identical wounds
to those on Froman.

32:05.836 --> 32:07.969
Same knife,
same style, same killer.

32:08.013 --> 32:10.102
Job's done. So, what?
He turns on his partner?

32:10.145 --> 32:11.712
There's no honor
among thieves.

32:11.755 --> 32:13.192
What, they fight over
the split, maybe?

32:13.235 --> 32:15.107
Or something
went sideways?

32:15.150 --> 32:16.325
Well, Grand
Theft Otto here

32:16.369 --> 32:17.413
matches the physical
description

32:17.457 --> 32:18.632
of the second
stick-up man

32:18.675 --> 32:19.894
from the cage robbery.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.287
Leaves the getaway
man outstanding.

32:21.330 --> 32:23.811
Why is that outstanding?

32:23.854 --> 32:26.683
Motel manager got plates
and a description.

32:26.727 --> 32:28.337
Got a BOLO out on the car.
Lexus, stolen.

32:28.381 --> 32:29.773
Okay, okay.

32:29.817 --> 32:32.385
This is the second guy
to get gutted on this caper.

32:32.428 --> 32:34.430
And somehow this woman's
at the heart of it.

32:34.474 --> 32:35.475
It's a heist movie.

32:35.518 --> 32:36.563
So there's
just one question

32:36.606 --> 32:38.652
that we have to answer:

32:38.695 --> 32:40.523
What would Steve McQueen do?

32:53.623 --> 32:56.235
You know,
it seems unfair.
You get to go home

32:56.278 --> 32:58.237
for giving us
the name of a man

32:58.280 --> 32:59.455
who's recently
been murdered.

32:59.499 --> 33:01.675
GIBBS:
A deal's a deal, Ziva.

33:01.718 --> 33:03.851
You ought to muzzle
your pups, Agent Gibbs.

33:03.894 --> 33:06.245
They all seem to have
a problem with barking.

33:06.288 --> 33:09.074
No, this one's
problem's definitely
her bite.

33:09.117 --> 33:11.380
I couldn't have predicted
Brackin's death.

33:11.424 --> 33:12.947
And I certainly
couldn't have

33:12.991 --> 33:15.515
anything to do with it
from the inside.

33:15.558 --> 33:17.604
Is that why you wanted
out so badly?

33:17.647 --> 33:19.649
Didn't look
so terrible to me.

33:19.693 --> 33:22.609
PHELPS:
You've obviously never had
your freedom taken away.

33:22.652 --> 33:26.265
[laughs] A real gift
for reading people, this one.

33:26.308 --> 33:29.746
Perception is reality.

33:29.790 --> 33:32.358
If I'm seen
as a criminal,

33:32.401 --> 33:34.099
I'll be treated
as a criminal.

33:34.142 --> 33:36.927
Despite the lack
of hard evidence

33:36.971 --> 33:38.320
on the part
of prosecution,

33:38.364 --> 33:42.020
incarceration sure gives
the appearance of guilt.

33:42.063 --> 33:46.676
Kind of empty
without all your
beautiful things.

33:46.720 --> 33:49.244
They're nothing...
next to freedom.

33:49.288 --> 33:52.204
Do not get ahead
of yourself.

33:52.247 --> 33:55.207
If you go beyond
that door,

33:55.250 --> 33:57.426
we will know about it.

33:57.470 --> 34:00.560
Fine. But other than that,
you leave me alone.

34:00.603 --> 34:02.214
No police presence!

34:02.257 --> 34:04.607
GIBBS:
Yep, that was the deal.

34:04.651 --> 34:07.088
ZIVA:
Enjoy solitary
confinement.

34:07.132 --> 34:08.959
TONY:
We steal for a living.

34:09.003 --> 34:11.484
We pull off that one last score,
McGee, we're set for life.

34:11.527 --> 34:13.442
But the cheese is hot.

34:13.486 --> 34:14.791
Where do we stash
the cash?

34:14.835 --> 34:17.446
Huh. Well, of course,
we take a meeting

34:17.490 --> 34:20.101
with Leona Phelps,
the unscrupulous
money manager.

34:20.145 --> 34:22.408
She's not gonna
ask questions.

34:22.451 --> 34:24.279
Right. If we invest our
stolen money with her...

34:24.323 --> 34:25.759
She'll clean it up,

34:25.802 --> 34:27.326
and we'll be fine.

34:27.369 --> 34:28.892
Till the whole thing
goes pear-shaped.

34:28.936 --> 34:29.980
And we're broke.

34:30.024 --> 34:32.548
That's it.

34:32.592 --> 34:34.376
She doesn't just ruin
the lives of good people.

34:34.420 --> 34:36.030
She ruins the lives
of bad people, too.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.163
The crooks have to come
out of retirement.

34:38.206 --> 34:41.122
They've got to pull off
one last, one last score.

34:41.166 --> 34:43.646
I'll cross-reference
the names of Phelps'

34:43.690 --> 34:45.257
victims with
criminal records.

34:45.300 --> 34:47.607
Bet we come up with someone
who served time with Brackin.

34:47.650 --> 34:49.043
What are they after?

34:49.087 --> 34:51.741
You want to know what
was in the desk?

34:51.785 --> 34:53.743
Absolutely.

34:53.787 --> 34:55.484
Believe it or not,
I found a collagen fiber

34:55.528 --> 34:57.138
that I determined
to be deerskin.

34:57.182 --> 34:59.358
Deer, huh? [chuckles]

34:59.401 --> 35:02.665
Um, I also found traces of
cellulose mixed in the linen

35:02.709 --> 35:05.494
as well as thermochromic ink
in the wood.

35:05.538 --> 35:07.757
High-end paper
and security ink.

35:07.801 --> 35:10.978
After referencing
the Secret Service

35:11.021 --> 35:14.155
ink and paper libraries, that is
where Leona Phelps stashed

35:14.199 --> 35:16.636
her Italian-made,
leather-embossed,

35:16.679 --> 35:18.942
one-of-a-kind
bookkeeping ledger.

35:18.986 --> 35:21.510
So, all
the missing money,

35:21.554 --> 35:23.077
I'm thinking "secret account"
somewhere.

35:23.121 --> 35:26.341
And it's all in the ledger,
which was all in the desk.

35:26.385 --> 35:29.475
Key word: "was."

36:02.072 --> 36:03.335
[sighs]

36:07.948 --> 36:10.820
[floorboard creaking]

36:10.864 --> 36:14.259
I thought the deal was,
I get left alone.

36:14.302 --> 36:16.086
MEDILLA:
Me, too.

36:17.523 --> 36:20.874
That was how Otto
convinced me

36:20.917 --> 36:23.181
to invest my money with you.

36:23.224 --> 36:26.227
We were never
gonna work again.

36:26.271 --> 36:29.012
You ruined that.

36:29.056 --> 36:32.668
Mr. Medilla...

36:32.712 --> 36:35.193
I'm sorry to hear
about your partner.

36:35.236 --> 36:36.368
We found the guy

36:36.411 --> 36:38.370
who could get us
in that warehouse.

36:38.413 --> 36:41.111
We went to all that trouble.

36:41.155 --> 36:43.984
The damn ledger
wasn't even there.

36:44.027 --> 36:47.335
I can imagine you must
have been very upset.

36:47.379 --> 36:49.729
I was.

36:49.772 --> 36:53.820
I would like to have it now.

36:53.863 --> 36:56.997
You want money.

36:57.040 --> 37:00.043
I understand.
I can get you money.

37:00.087 --> 37:02.089
I do.

37:02.132 --> 37:04.134
And more than that...

37:04.178 --> 37:05.788
I want your blood.

37:15.189 --> 37:17.017
[phone rings]

37:17.060 --> 37:19.237
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.804
Boss, DNA from the gum wrapper
matched Ruleo Medilla.

37:21.848 --> 37:23.284
He's the last member
of the crew.

37:23.328 --> 37:24.459
Phelps lost all their money.
She knew it was them

37:24.503 --> 37:26.548
as soon
as she heard the word "heist."

37:26.592 --> 37:27.636
She knew what they were after.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.812
Same thing
the prosecution's after.

37:29.856 --> 37:31.161
Same thing you're after.
She had to

37:31.205 --> 37:34.295
get out and get it first.
It's a smoking gun.

37:34.339 --> 37:37.124
Uh-huh. What's next?

37:37.167 --> 37:38.386
Bullitt.

37:42.390 --> 37:44.305
[panicked gasping]

37:47.526 --> 37:51.094
Oh, she's on the run.

37:51.138 --> 37:52.792
Help!

37:53.619 --> 37:54.968
He's got a knife!

37:55.011 --> 37:55.882
Please!

37:57.492 --> 37:58.928
Ziva, stay with her!

38:01.888 --> 38:02.758
[grunts]

38:05.848 --> 38:06.980
[tires squealing]

38:07.023 --> 38:09.069
You violated
your house-arrest agreement.

38:09.112 --> 38:10.897
But for this,

38:10.940 --> 38:13.639
you're going away
for life.

38:13.682 --> 38:15.075
[panting]

38:17.860 --> 38:20.298
[engine revving]

38:42.407 --> 38:43.756
[engine revving]

38:51.677 --> 38:52.765
[metal crunching]

38:55.158 --> 38:56.334
[grunts]

39:01.426 --> 39:02.470
[tires squealing]

39:15.265 --> 39:16.528
[sighs]

39:27.408 --> 39:29.541
TONY: Like Doc McCoy in
The Getaway.

39:29.584 --> 39:32.413
Yeah? No, not really.

39:32.457 --> 39:36.678
McQueen had Jewison,
he had Yates,

39:36.722 --> 39:39.072
he had Peckinpah
right there,

39:39.115 --> 39:40.987
guiding him,
navigating him.
molding him.

39:41.030 --> 39:43.598
You would have made
a great director, boss.

39:44.730 --> 39:47.385
Yeah, well, already got
one of those.

39:50.344 --> 39:52.259
McQueen also had
Jacqueline Bisset,

39:52.302 --> 39:55.436
Faye Dunaway
and Ali MacGraw.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.438
You notice the new girl
likes to shower here

39:57.482 --> 39:59.745
before she goes home?

40:03.531 --> 40:05.533
Hey, did you hear me?

40:14.586 --> 40:17.415
TONY:
You know, I was
offered your job.

40:17.458 --> 40:18.241
I turned it down.

40:18.285 --> 40:19.460
Thank you.

40:19.504 --> 40:21.375
Towel, please?

40:21.419 --> 40:23.377
[shower turns off]

40:23.421 --> 40:25.988
So, why would you do that?

40:26.032 --> 40:29.209
I wanted this team,
here in D.C.;

40:29.252 --> 40:30.732
the varsity.

40:30.776 --> 40:32.125
How'd Gibbs feel about that?

40:32.168 --> 40:35.998
Well, he left.
He gave it to me.

40:36.042 --> 40:38.174
You know, I was
pretty good at it.

40:38.218 --> 40:40.394
I mean, I made
a couple rookie mistakes,

40:40.438 --> 40:44.267
but I was figuring it out.

40:46.095 --> 40:47.053
And then Gibbs
took it back?

40:47.096 --> 40:53.015
Yeah, he did.

40:53.059 --> 40:58.673
The previous director,
Shepard, she, uh...

40:58.717 --> 41:00.545
she saw something in me.

41:00.588 --> 41:02.460
Kept an eye on me.

41:02.503 --> 41:03.678
Smart woman.

41:06.289 --> 41:07.508
Hmm.

41:15.168 --> 41:17.605
There are rules
against this.

41:17.649 --> 41:21.649
No, there aren't.
