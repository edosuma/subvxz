00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:06.750 --> 00:09.166
The last time I lived
with a man? Uh...

00:09.208 --> 00:13.041
It was with Derek
in a trailer in the woods.

00:13.083 --> 00:18.917
Way deep in the woods,
like with woodland creatures.

00:18.959 --> 00:20.125
Okay?

00:20.166 --> 00:22.041
The shower was about
the size of a toilet,

00:22.083 --> 00:24.333
and I got poison ivy on my...

00:24.375 --> 00:26.166
( chuckles )

00:26.208 --> 00:28.667
Yeah, I got poison ivy.

00:28.709 --> 00:32.792
Yeah,
it was a failed experiment

00:32.834 --> 00:34.250
in pushing my own boundaries.

00:34.291 --> 00:36.792
( tender pop music playing )

00:38.208 --> 00:44.000
But in some ways,
I'm proud of that chapter.

00:45.166 --> 00:47.417
I fought for love.

00:48.667 --> 00:51.041
I got poison ivy on...

00:51.083 --> 00:54.041
You know, I lost.

00:54.083 --> 00:56.291
But I really fought.

00:56.333 --> 01:00.333
THERAPIST:
Are you afraid now
to lose again?

01:02.125 --> 01:05.041
( both panting )

01:05.083 --> 01:07.000
Wow.
Oh, that's good stuff.

01:07.041 --> 01:08.083
( laughs )

01:08.125 --> 01:10.041
Oh, that's good stuff.

01:10.083 --> 01:12.041
I like living together.

01:12.083 --> 01:14.291
I like it too.

01:14.333 --> 01:17.041
All right. Come here.

01:17.083 --> 01:18.041
( Addison chuckles )

01:18.083 --> 01:20.834
No, Sam.
We have to go to work now.

01:20.875 --> 01:22.458
Come on.
I'm the boss now.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.000
No, you ain't the boss of me.

01:24.041 --> 01:25.041
( laughs )

01:25.083 --> 01:26.875
You...
I am too.

01:26.917 --> 01:29.041
I'm the boss. Now.

01:29.083 --> 01:30.417
Wait. M-- Okay.
Come on.

01:30.458 --> 01:31.917
We have a business to run.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.041
SAM:
Where you going?

01:33.083 --> 01:35.041
ADDISON:
Sam. Aah!

01:35.083 --> 01:36.125
( both laugh )

01:36.166 --> 01:38.041
I have to go to work.

01:38.083 --> 01:39.500
Mm-mm.
Mm.

01:39.542 --> 01:40.709
Mm-mm.

01:40.750 --> 01:42.250
( both moaning )

01:42.291 --> 01:44.625
ADDISON:
What are you doing?

01:44.667 --> 01:47.041
You are not the boss in here.

01:47.083 --> 01:49.041
Oh. Okay.

01:49.083 --> 01:51.291
I like...

01:51.333 --> 01:54.208
I like not being
the boss in here.

01:54.250 --> 01:56.750
( dishes clattering )

02:02.166 --> 02:04.083
Huh. Looks like Amelia's

02:04.125 --> 02:05.625
housewarming party's
finally over.

02:05.667 --> 02:06.792
ADDISON:
Mm-hm.

02:10.625 --> 02:13.041
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. Sam.

02:13.083 --> 02:14.917
( Sam &amp; Addison laughing )

02:21.083 --> 02:23.750
Tell us why you'd like to work
for Oceanside Wellness Group.

02:23.792 --> 02:25.250
MAN:
I saw the posting,
and to be frank,

02:25.291 --> 02:27.125
I'm surprised to see
you guys are still open,

02:27.166 --> 02:30.166
you know, given all the bad
press with the medical board.

02:30.208 --> 02:33.458
Well, those accusations have
been somewhat exaggerated.

02:33.500 --> 02:34.834
Somewhat?

02:34.875 --> 02:36.917
Either they're investigating
you or they're not.

02:36.959 --> 02:39.917
SAM:
Okay, well, would you consider
yourself a team player?

02:39.959 --> 02:42.041
Team player?

02:42.083 --> 02:44.917
I'm not a big fan of sports,
if that's what you're asking.

02:44.959 --> 02:47.041
Can you tell us why you
decided to become a doctor?

02:47.083 --> 02:49.166
Well, back then,
we called it a career path.

02:49.208 --> 02:52.750
You had a choice:
lawyer, doctor, or dentist.

02:52.792 --> 02:55.083
Who wants to have their hands
in someone's mouth?

02:55.125 --> 02:56.917
ADDISON:
Your resume is a bit
confusing.

02:56.959 --> 02:58.709
What year did you graduate
medical school?

02:58.750 --> 03:00.709
2006.
Fast-tracked it in 3.

03:00.750 --> 03:03.041
My endocrinology residency,
did it in four.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.375
This is really good coffee.

03:04.417 --> 03:06.542
Do you make this
in-house or send out?

03:06.583 --> 03:08.125
Uh, that's in-house.

03:08.166 --> 03:10.250
That's good. That's a perk.
I like perks.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.750
What's the parking sitch?

03:11.792 --> 03:14.000
I hate dings.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.667
Anyone here golf?
We'll be in touch.

03:17.709 --> 03:19.041
Thanks for coming in.

03:19.083 --> 03:21.125
We'll get back to you.

03:21.166 --> 03:23.125
They can't all be that bad.

03:23.166 --> 03:24.542
You wouldn't think so.

03:24.583 --> 03:26.041
One asked if he could
bring his cat.

03:26.083 --> 03:28.041
He sounds like a keeper.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.250
I feel optimistic.

03:29.291 --> 03:31.041
We've got a lot more people
to interview.

03:31.083 --> 03:32.041
We'll find someone.

03:32.083 --> 03:34.041
Morning, beautiful people.
Look who's here.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.333
Well, isn't this
a nice surprise?

03:36.375 --> 03:37.959
You're looking well.
Feeling well.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.250
I'm ready to work.

03:39.291 --> 03:40.792
Uh, no caffeine.
Stick with decaf.

03:40.834 --> 03:42.417
SAM:
We agreed it was
a little early.

03:42.458 --> 03:43.500
PETE:
What can I say?

03:43.542 --> 03:45.208
I am sick
of daytime television.

03:45.250 --> 03:46.709
Quadruple bypass
is no joke, Pete.

03:46.750 --> 03:47.917
You sound
just like Violet.

03:47.959 --> 03:50.458
She's right.
Thank you.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.041
Well, maybe
you give it another week.

03:52.083 --> 03:53.250
PETE:
I'll ease into it.

03:53.291 --> 03:54.875
Uh, okay.
Well, as long as

03:54.917 --> 03:56.917
you stick to the agreed-upon
rehab protocol.

03:56.959 --> 03:58.875
You know, that graft site
is still healing.

03:58.917 --> 04:01.041
You don't want to
stress the suture line.

04:01.083 --> 04:02.458
Just don't overexert yourself.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.000
Got it? Okay.
Got it.

04:04.041 --> 04:07.041
Are you already interviewing
for Naomi's job?

04:07.083 --> 04:09.041
Oh, well, empty office
doesn't bring money in.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.166
Don't worry.
We haven't found anybody yet.

04:11.208 --> 04:12.500
VIOLET:
No, no, it's not that.

04:12.542 --> 04:14.458
I just thought maybe I could
help with the hiring.

04:14.500 --> 04:15.959
I know I'm not
seeing patients yet,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.041
but if you need somebody
to vet the resumes

04:18.083 --> 04:20.083
or do a psych breakdown
or...

04:20.125 --> 04:21.542
Lucas is with the babysitter,

04:21.583 --> 04:23.625
and I'd kind of rather
be here than at home.

04:23.667 --> 04:25.041
I don't have a problem.

04:25.083 --> 04:27.125
SHELDON:
You've been suspended
from seeing patients,

04:27.166 --> 04:28.500
doesn't mean
you can't help out.

04:28.542 --> 04:31.125
Enjoy.
VIOLET: Thanks.

04:31.166 --> 04:33.750
Great.
Great.

04:46.709 --> 04:48.041
You're late, Dr. Freedman.

04:48.083 --> 04:49.792
Try sneaking
a 32-inch television

04:49.834 --> 04:51.792
past the nurses' station.
( Greg chuckles )

04:51.834 --> 04:53.458
COOPER:
Popcorn is for later.

04:53.500 --> 04:54.875
What are we watching?

04:54.917 --> 04:57.041
No, wait. Let me guess.
Uh, The Little Mermaid.

04:57.083 --> 04:58.375
We watched that already.

04:58.417 --> 05:00.041
COOPER:
Cartoons was last month's
theme.

05:00.083 --> 05:02.291
This month,
it's all about the musical.

05:02.333 --> 05:04.583
Right?
So tonight's feature...

05:04.625 --> 05:06.041
You can tell them.

05:06.083 --> 05:09.291
Oliver! It's a musical
with real live people.

05:09.333 --> 05:11.709
And starving orphans.
It's very uplifting.

05:11.750 --> 05:13.083
Dr. Freedman,
here are the labs.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.166
COOPER:
Thank you.

05:14.208 --> 05:18.041
( tender theme playing )

05:18.083 --> 05:20.750
I am going to talk
to your folks outside, okay?

05:20.792 --> 05:23.333
Do not eat my popcorn.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.041
These are the results
from Kerri's last blood smear.

05:31.083 --> 05:33.041
It's not good, is it?
I knew it.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.291
There's no weight gain.
Her face is still so pale.

05:35.333 --> 05:37.709
Let him speak.

05:37.750 --> 05:39.208
Her leukemia's back.

05:40.542 --> 05:44.583
But you said my bone marrow
was a good match.

05:44.625 --> 05:46.500
It is. Um...

05:46.542 --> 05:48.875
Sometimes a good match
just doesn't work.

05:50.625 --> 05:52.291
Okay.

05:52.333 --> 05:54.041
So, what are our options?

05:54.083 --> 05:56.625
There's only one.
It's a cord blood transfusion,

05:56.667 --> 05:58.000
and quickly.

06:00.667 --> 06:03.250
When Kerri was born, we...

06:03.291 --> 06:04.625
Money was tight.

06:04.667 --> 06:07.000
We weren't sure
we'd ever need it.

06:07.041 --> 06:09.041
That wouldn't help. The genetic
marker for leukemia

06:09.083 --> 06:11.000
is already in Kerri's blood,

06:11.041 --> 06:12.458
so we need the cord blood

06:12.500 --> 06:14.000
from another child
who's a match.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.875
Where do we get it?
Most hospitals,

06:15.917 --> 06:17.041
including St. Ambrose,

06:17.083 --> 06:19.792
have a cord blood donor bank.
We'll start looking.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.834
( Sam speaking indistinctly )

06:23.875 --> 06:26.041
You two certainly
started your day off right.

06:26.083 --> 06:27.417
And that's my cue to leave.

06:27.458 --> 06:28.917
Ha, ha. Here.

06:28.959 --> 06:30.083
Yeah, I got it.
See you.

06:30.125 --> 06:31.709
He does know
I'm a grown-up, right?

06:31.750 --> 06:35.709
We're just not used to having
neighbors with noises.

06:35.750 --> 06:38.375
Noisy neighbors
who have parties at--

06:38.417 --> 06:40.000
When did I become
the nosy landlady?

06:40.041 --> 06:42.375
Scary.
But it is still your place,

06:42.417 --> 06:44.417
and that party was
just a little housewarming.

06:44.458 --> 06:46.208
Not gonna be
a weekly occurrence.

06:46.250 --> 06:49.250
Just be careful, you know,
with all the partying.

06:49.291 --> 06:51.291
I'm not drinking,
if that is what you're asking.

06:51.333 --> 06:53.041
Not a drop.
Mm-hm.

06:53.083 --> 06:55.041
I was the happy,
sober hostess last night.

06:55.083 --> 06:56.291
Scout's honor.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.917
I believe you.
And what about that guy?

06:58.959 --> 07:00.542
Javier?
Mm-hm.

07:00.583 --> 07:01.667
He's a painter.

07:01.709 --> 07:03.542
Ooh, an artist.
That's sexy.

07:03.583 --> 07:06.709
He does houses, but you
should see his six-pack.

07:06.750 --> 07:07.959
Javier.

07:09.166 --> 07:11.250
Computer won't go any faster
with you hovering, Coop.

07:11.291 --> 07:13.709
Making sure you have
Kerri's information right.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.208
I do, and if there's
a cord blood match,

07:15.250 --> 07:16.959
we'll know in a second.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.083
( beeps )

07:19.125 --> 07:20.667
Search again.

07:20.709 --> 07:22.291
Cooper--
Somewhere in this country,

07:22.333 --> 07:24.041
there's gotta be a match
for this girl.

07:24.083 --> 07:25.041
Move over.
Let me search.

07:25.083 --> 07:27.041
I've checked
the public donor banks.

07:27.083 --> 07:28.667
I'm sorry,
but there's no match.

07:30.667 --> 07:33.041
Check the private ones.

07:33.083 --> 07:35.041
Come on, Charlotte.
You're chief of staff.

07:35.083 --> 07:36.667
You have the authorization
to do it.

07:36.709 --> 07:38.500
That cord blood
isn't for the public.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.166
Families are saving it
in case they need it.

07:40.208 --> 07:42.041
99% of cord blood
never gets used.

07:42.083 --> 07:44.375
It just goes to waste.
And what about Kerri?

07:44.417 --> 07:46.166
She will die without
this blood transfusion.

07:46.208 --> 07:47.542
She's special to you.

07:47.583 --> 07:49.875
But there are
a thousand Kerris out there

07:49.917 --> 07:51.041
who want me
to break the rules.

07:51.083 --> 07:52.834
I can't do that.

07:54.083 --> 07:55.709
We have a cooperative
practice.

07:55.750 --> 07:58.166
Nothing wrong
with a little cooperation.

07:58.208 --> 08:00.667
So that would work for you?

08:00.709 --> 08:03.000
I can make anything work
with the right people.

08:03.041 --> 08:06.000
Okay, then.
Thank you for coming in.

08:06.041 --> 08:08.458
You have our number.

08:08.500 --> 08:09.750
( chuckling )

08:09.792 --> 08:10.750
ADDISON:
Who's next?

08:10.792 --> 08:12.041
Dr. Jake Reilly.

08:12.083 --> 08:15.417
SAM:
Jake Reilly, MD.

08:15.458 --> 08:18.208
You know what? I think I'm
gonna, uh, sit this one out.

08:18.250 --> 08:20.291
Why? This guy
actually sounds pretty great.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.542
Duke Medical School,
time at Johns Hopkins.

08:22.583 --> 08:23.959
SAM:
Double board-certified

08:24.000 --> 08:26.041
with a fellowship in
reproductive endocrinology.

08:26.083 --> 08:28.500
I have a lot of work.
You guys can finish up. Huh?

08:28.542 --> 08:29.917
No, no, no.
He's already here.

08:29.959 --> 08:32.166
Let's just get this over with.
Sit down. Sit down.

08:32.208 --> 08:33.875
JAKE:
Thank you.

08:38.125 --> 08:39.458
Have we met before?

08:45.458 --> 08:47.125
SAM:
We absolutely have met before.

08:47.166 --> 08:48.875
Um...
( Jake snaps fingers )

08:48.917 --> 08:50.417
I got it.
Intramural basketball.

08:50.458 --> 08:52.750
Intramural hoops.
Yes, exactly.

08:52.792 --> 08:54.458
Wow.
( Sam &amp; Jake laugh )

08:54.500 --> 08:56.041
A long time.
You know each other?

08:56.083 --> 08:59.250
Yeah, uh,
undergrad at Georgetown.

08:59.291 --> 09:01.208
You guys used to kick
our asses all the time.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.041
SAM:
We did. I'm sorry about that.
Ha-ha-ha.

09:03.083 --> 09:05.041
I played field hockey
at Emerson.

09:08.083 --> 09:09.125
Well, all right.

09:09.166 --> 09:12.041
( men laughing )

09:12.083 --> 09:14.166
So, uh, it says here
that you

09:14.208 --> 09:17.417
are double board-certified
in general surgery and ob-gyn.

09:17.458 --> 09:20.500
They're fairly divergent
disciplines.

09:20.542 --> 09:23.208
What,
you just couldn't choose?

09:23.250 --> 09:25.041
Addison--
JAKE: Not at all.

09:25.083 --> 09:26.709
Surgery is the hardest
of the specialties

09:26.750 --> 09:28.041
in terms of pure skill.

09:28.083 --> 09:30.041
I'm sure as a fellow surgeon,
you would agree.

09:30.083 --> 09:32.458
But obstetrics, it's all about
caring for the patient.

09:32.500 --> 09:36.208
And fertility in particular,
it, uh...

09:36.250 --> 09:37.667
It requires
a hands-on approach,

09:37.709 --> 09:39.166
in a different way.

09:39.208 --> 09:41.375
I could do both, so I did.

09:41.417 --> 09:45.041
Well, we're looking for
team players, not superstars.

09:45.083 --> 09:46.583
Well, look no further, really.

09:46.625 --> 09:49.166
I mean, I love
the team approach.

09:49.208 --> 09:50.875
In fact, I'm really happy
to hear you say

09:50.917 --> 09:52.500
that you're not moving
away from it.

09:52.542 --> 09:53.917
What does that mean?

09:53.959 --> 09:56.041
Frankly, I know about

09:56.083 --> 09:57.625
your problems with
the medical board.

09:57.667 --> 09:59.041
Everyone does.

09:59.083 --> 10:01.041
I understand the instinct
to hunker down

10:01.083 --> 10:03.083
and play defense, but...

10:03.125 --> 10:06.208
You already gave them
Dr. Turner as a scapegoat.

10:06.250 --> 10:07.500
You don't need to do more.

10:07.542 --> 10:09.500
Unfortunately, the medical board
doesn't agree.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.083
That might be because
they don't have

10:11.125 --> 10:12.208
every side of the story.

10:12.250 --> 10:13.458
What do you mean?

10:13.500 --> 10:14.709
If I were you guys,

10:14.750 --> 10:16.083
I would start to play
a little offense.

10:16.125 --> 10:18.083
Okay, offense, defense.

10:18.125 --> 10:20.041
You know, this is
a very real threat

10:20.083 --> 10:21.875
that requires a real solution,
Dr. Reilly,

10:21.917 --> 10:24.041
not some sports clichés.

10:24.083 --> 10:26.709
What I was going to say is
be smart.

10:26.750 --> 10:29.000
I mean, you're all
under suspicion, right?

10:29.041 --> 10:31.041
So take yourselves
out of the process.

10:31.083 --> 10:33.041
Spend five minutes,

10:33.083 --> 10:35.500
find out who left the board
most recently,

10:35.542 --> 10:37.709
because I guarantee
they're in the private sector

10:37.750 --> 10:39.041
and they're for hire.

10:39.083 --> 10:41.083
So you bring them on
as a consultant

10:41.125 --> 10:43.000
and share with them
your success stories

10:43.041 --> 10:44.583
on how you guys
work together,

10:44.625 --> 10:46.041
how you share
patient information,

10:46.083 --> 10:48.041
everything you're doing
that's bringing the board

10:48.083 --> 10:49.375
on top of you right now.

10:49.417 --> 10:51.166
You give them all the ammo
you can find,

10:51.208 --> 10:53.709
files, letters from patients,
pictures of healthy children,

10:53.750 --> 10:56.333
anything you can find, and then
let them

10:56.375 --> 10:58.333
sell it back
to their friends on the board.

10:58.375 --> 10:59.834
Everyone wins, right?

11:01.125 --> 11:03.583
Oh, and the consultant's
also going to tell you

11:03.625 --> 11:07.208
to change the name
of your practice, so...

11:07.250 --> 11:09.000
you might start
thinking about that now.

11:15.875 --> 11:16.959
VIOLET:
Oh.

11:17.959 --> 11:19.542
I'm so sorry.
You all right?

11:19.583 --> 11:21.041
VIOLET:
Yes.

11:21.083 --> 11:22.375
You're Dr. Violet Turner,
right?

11:22.417 --> 11:24.375
Yes. Have we met?

11:24.417 --> 11:27.291
Uh, no, actually.
But I've read your book.

11:27.333 --> 11:29.083
Very impressive.

11:29.125 --> 11:30.458
Yes, my book.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.333
I always forget that
my picture's on the cover.

11:32.375 --> 11:34.125
Well, you should be
very proud of it.

11:34.166 --> 11:35.542
It takes a lot of courage

11:35.583 --> 11:37.834
to put it all out there,
and you did.

11:37.875 --> 11:40.041
And there's no telling
how many people you've helped.

11:41.667 --> 11:42.625
Thank you.

11:42.667 --> 11:43.875
Uh, Dr. Jake Reilly.

11:43.917 --> 11:45.250
I just interviewed
for a job here.

11:45.291 --> 11:47.041
Yes. Yes,
I just read your resume.

11:47.083 --> 11:48.625
Equally impressive.

11:48.667 --> 11:52.000
Oh, thanks. Maybe you can
put in a good word for me.

11:59.834 --> 12:02.166
Hey. I know you guys
are busy interviewing,

12:02.208 --> 12:04.458
but I just met one of
the candidates out there.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.875
Dr. Jake Reilly.
Wow. What a good guy.

12:07.917 --> 12:11.875
Deep thinker. It really feels
like he'd be a good fit.

12:11.917 --> 12:13.333
I'm just saying.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.667
SHELDON:
Hey, come on in.
Have a seat.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.208
Oh, hey, Addison.
Hmm?

12:24.250 --> 12:25.834
Come with me.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.792
What's wrong?
I'm gone for a month,

12:27.834 --> 12:30.041
and you turn my office
into a storage closet?

12:30.083 --> 12:31.709
I've been going through
this all day.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.291
Half these boxes
aren't even mine.

12:33.333 --> 12:35.041
How do you expect me
to see patients?

12:35.083 --> 12:36.667
I know.
I'm sorry, Pete.

12:36.709 --> 12:39.041
Violet said you weren't gonna
be back for three weeks--

12:39.083 --> 12:41.458
Did she also tell you
that she put in shower bars

12:41.500 --> 12:42.917
because she's afraid
I'll slip,

12:42.959 --> 12:45.083
or that she lays out my
vitamins like I'm 10 years old,

12:45.125 --> 12:47.208
or she checks that I'm
breathing every 15 minutes?

12:47.250 --> 12:49.125
Pete.
Let me help you with that.

12:49.166 --> 12:50.542
I can handle it.
Pete. Pete--

12:50.583 --> 12:51.709
I can handle it.

12:51.750 --> 12:55.041
Respectfully,
I run this place now.

12:55.083 --> 12:57.208
If you pick these up
and tear your heart stitches

12:57.250 --> 12:59.208
and bleed all over
the floor of my practice,

12:59.250 --> 13:01.458
it's gonna piss me off.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.041
You wanna come back
to work early?

13:03.083 --> 13:06.333
Fine. But don't be
a complete idiot about it.

13:09.375 --> 13:12.750
I will have these cleared out
by the end of the day.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.000
Charlotte's
the chief of staff.

13:21.041 --> 13:22.458
You can't expect her
to break the rules

13:22.500 --> 13:24.041
just because she's your wife.
Sure I can.

13:24.083 --> 13:26.875
You know if it was Pete
asking, you would do it.

13:26.917 --> 13:28.083
Well,
Pete would never ask,

13:28.125 --> 13:30.834
because that would involve
communicating with me.

13:32.792 --> 13:34.750
You and Pete
are not speaking?

13:34.792 --> 13:38.333
Yes, we did at the beginning,
after the heart attack.

13:38.375 --> 13:41.041
But, no, for the last few
weeks, he barely looks at me.

13:41.083 --> 13:42.667
And then when he does,
he's never smiling.

13:42.709 --> 13:44.041
Hmm.

13:44.083 --> 13:45.291
I don't know,
I'm beginning to think

13:45.333 --> 13:47.166
that his early return to work
has less to do with work

13:47.208 --> 13:48.625
and more with
getting away from me.

13:48.667 --> 13:50.125
Yeah, probably.

13:52.083 --> 13:53.542
Wow.
What?

13:53.583 --> 13:56.208
I don't know. I guess I was
just kind of hoping for:

13:56.250 --> 13:58.750
"Don't be crazy, Violet.
Your husband loves you."

13:58.792 --> 14:01.041
Of course he loves you,
but he also hates you.

14:01.083 --> 14:03.208
I mean, he's been laying
on his ass for a month,

14:03.250 --> 14:04.709
totally dependent on you.

14:04.750 --> 14:06.208
Okay, so you're saying

14:06.250 --> 14:08.083
that he's emasculated
by his condition

14:08.125 --> 14:09.625
and he's projecting
that on me.

14:09.667 --> 14:11.625
No, those are big shrinky
words I wouldn't use.

14:11.667 --> 14:13.542
What I'm saying is...

14:15.208 --> 14:18.417
Look, from what I hear,
this morning,

14:18.458 --> 14:20.625
in front of all of
his colleagues,

14:20.667 --> 14:22.208
you pulled a chair
out for him,

14:22.250 --> 14:25.291
and you told him what kind of
coffee he can drink.

14:27.250 --> 14:28.667
I'm worried about him.

14:28.709 --> 14:30.041
I know,
but you gotta ease up

14:30.083 --> 14:31.583
on the Florence Nightingale
routine,

14:31.625 --> 14:34.041
because unless it comes
with a naughty nurse's outfit,

14:34.083 --> 14:35.417
he's not gonna like it.

14:35.458 --> 14:38.000
( chuckles )

14:44.083 --> 14:45.041
Hey.

14:45.083 --> 14:46.041
Find anyone good?

14:46.083 --> 14:47.875
Uh, yeah, a few.

14:47.917 --> 14:50.709
But front-runner
is still Jake Reilly.

14:51.959 --> 14:52.959
You don't like him.

14:55.083 --> 14:56.709
No.

14:58.125 --> 15:01.041
Yes.
Jake is the Fiji guy.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.417
I mean, almost-Fiji guy.

15:03.458 --> 15:05.375
Oh, you mean
at the airport?

15:05.417 --> 15:07.041
Yes.
Wow.

15:07.083 --> 15:09.583
Yeah, so if you can find
anything on his resume

15:09.625 --> 15:13.041
that is sketchy, shady,
or in any way questionable,

15:13.083 --> 15:15.250
please tell me, because
I'm the only one in the office

15:15.291 --> 15:16.500
who doesn't like this guy,

15:16.542 --> 15:18.041
and I'm starting to
run out of excuses.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.792
Okay. Well, uh...

15:20.834 --> 15:22.041
He is not a member

15:22.083 --> 15:25.709
of the American Society
for Reproductive Medicine.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.041
You're not serious.

15:27.083 --> 15:29.500
Naomi used to talk about it.
It's not on his resume.

15:29.542 --> 15:32.041
It's his only shortcoming.

15:32.083 --> 15:34.333
Really?
I'm sorry.

15:34.375 --> 15:35.667
Does Sam know?

15:35.709 --> 15:38.041
No, and I have
no intention of telling him.

15:38.083 --> 15:40.959
We were broken up. All I did
was go to the airport.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.709
I kissed him once.

15:44.750 --> 15:47.542
Actually, more than once,
but I did not go to Fiji,

15:47.583 --> 15:49.458
and that's what counts.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.792
You know,
and Sam and I are great.

15:53.083 --> 15:54.583
So why can't we hire him?

16:00.458 --> 16:02.500
Dr. Freedman?

16:02.542 --> 16:04.333
Hey, sleepyhead.

16:04.375 --> 16:06.709
All right.
You ready to watch this movie?

16:09.208 --> 16:11.000
You okay?

16:12.417 --> 16:14.041
I'm a little tired.

16:14.083 --> 16:15.792
Can we watch it tomorrow?

16:15.834 --> 16:17.792
You sure?

16:17.834 --> 16:19.291
Okay.

16:19.333 --> 16:22.583
I can't watch it tomorrow,
but I can come Saturday.

16:22.625 --> 16:24.917
Okay.
Okay?

16:26.041 --> 16:28.458
Will I still be alive?

16:28.500 --> 16:30.500
( suspenseful theme playing )

16:52.250 --> 16:53.333
( beeps )

16:59.083 --> 17:00.000
( beeps )

17:09.083 --> 17:10.917
Bingo.

17:20.083 --> 17:21.959
I know it's a lot to digest,

17:22.000 --> 17:24.041
but Kerri does not have
a lot of time.

17:24.083 --> 17:26.417
This disease,
it's like a cancer?

17:26.458 --> 17:29.208
Yeah. It is cancer,
but of the blood.

17:29.250 --> 17:32.000
Oh, she's so young.

17:32.041 --> 17:34.333
With all due respect,
Dr. Freedman,

17:34.375 --> 17:36.041
what does this have to do
with us?

17:36.083 --> 17:37.458
When each of your boys
was born,

17:37.500 --> 17:40.041
you decided to keep and store
their cord blood.

17:40.083 --> 17:42.041
And according to our database,
your oldest son, Kip,

17:42.083 --> 17:43.625
is a perfect match
for Kerri.

17:43.667 --> 17:45.041
Um, the cord blood bank,

17:45.083 --> 17:46.375
it's supposed to be
confidential.

17:46.417 --> 17:48.625
Who gave you permission
to look at our records?

17:48.667 --> 17:50.041
I'm gonna go shoot hoops.

17:50.083 --> 17:51.458
Make sure you're home
for dinner.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.041
Okay.

17:53.083 --> 17:55.458
Is that Kip?
ELLEN: That's Matt.

17:55.500 --> 17:58.041
Kip died in a car accident
when he was 6.

17:58.083 --> 18:01.667
But we've kept his cord blood
in case Matt ever needs it.

18:01.709 --> 18:04.500
COOPER:
Oh. I'm sorry for your loss.
Um...

18:04.542 --> 18:07.458
But Matt is a teenager now.
ROBERT: So?

18:07.500 --> 18:09.041
Well, at his age,

18:09.083 --> 18:11.291
the odds that he would need
cord blood are miniscule.

18:11.333 --> 18:14.208
It's easy to talk about odds
when you haven't lost a child.

18:16.083 --> 18:18.125
And I can't imagine
how painful that's been.

18:18.166 --> 18:21.417
But you do have the opportunity
to spare another family

18:21.458 --> 18:24.333
the grief
that you've been through.

18:27.083 --> 18:30.291
Here's my chip.
Thirty days sober.

18:30.333 --> 18:32.000
Good for you.

18:33.333 --> 18:36.250
So now there's no more excuses
why my name keeps disappearing

18:36.291 --> 18:38.041
from the surgical rotation
every week.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.750
I'll think about it.

18:39.792 --> 18:41.333
But you let me do
Pete's surgery,

18:41.375 --> 18:42.750
and I saved his life.

18:42.792 --> 18:45.083
I told you,
it was a one-time exception.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.583
Thank you.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.000
Now it's time to get back
to saving yourself.

18:49.041 --> 18:50.917
I haven't had a drink
in a month.

18:50.959 --> 18:52.125
So you say.

18:52.166 --> 18:54.709
What do you want me to do to
prove it, take a breathalyzer?

18:54.750 --> 18:56.125
You want me to pee
in a cup?

18:56.166 --> 18:58.500
You cut into a patient's head
after you'd been drinking.

18:58.542 --> 19:00.750
Both that patient and Pete
survived because of me.

19:00.792 --> 19:02.917
What if the next one's
not so lucky?

19:21.667 --> 19:23.792
( Addison chuckles )

19:23.834 --> 19:25.583
Wow. What's that for?

19:25.625 --> 19:26.917
You're doing a great job.

19:26.959 --> 19:28.834
You're not throwing around
your authority.

19:28.875 --> 19:30.959
You're not rubbing it
in anyone's face.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
You're just being you...

19:34.083 --> 19:35.834
And I like it.

19:36.834 --> 19:38.542
Thank you.
Mm-hm.

19:42.208 --> 19:44.500
So are you just gonna
stare at that coffee

19:44.542 --> 19:45.709
or you gonna pour it?

19:45.750 --> 19:47.000
Well, there's
all these studies

19:47.041 --> 19:48.417
about caffeine
and getting pregnant.

19:48.458 --> 19:50.041
And I've already had
two cups today,

19:50.083 --> 19:52.750
so I guess
I'm just staring.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.333
Okay.

19:54.375 --> 19:56.417
Look, I'm gonna be...

19:56.458 --> 19:59.208
I'm gonna be going
off birth control,

19:59.250 --> 20:02.834
and, um, I mean,
I know the odds of me

20:02.875 --> 20:05.250
getting pregnant by mistake
are roughly a cajillion to 1,

20:05.291 --> 20:07.041
but I...

20:07.083 --> 20:09.083
I'm gonna need you
to start wearing condoms.

20:11.083 --> 20:12.750
You're serious?
I wanna have a baby,

20:12.792 --> 20:14.041
you don't wanna have a baby.

20:14.083 --> 20:16.417
It means I can't use
your sperm, so, yeah.

20:16.458 --> 20:18.083
I mean, come on,
you get it, Sam.

20:19.917 --> 20:21.709
Condoms?

20:27.041 --> 20:28.166
( knocking on door )

20:31.125 --> 20:33.250
There's a debate happening
inside my head.

20:34.542 --> 20:36.291
You wanna hear both sides?

20:36.333 --> 20:38.041
Okay.

20:38.083 --> 20:40.041
One side says
that you're hiding in here

20:40.083 --> 20:41.875
because you're
avoiding me personally.

20:41.917 --> 20:44.000
And the other side says

20:44.041 --> 20:47.000
that you're hiding in here
to avoid the entire world.

20:48.208 --> 20:51.500
You know Charlotte still
has me benched from surgery?

20:51.542 --> 20:55.041
Are you getting help?
Are you clean and sober?

20:55.083 --> 20:57.041
Because Charlotte isn't
generally unreasonable--

20:57.083 --> 20:58.792
Charlotte's a bitch, Sheldon.

20:58.834 --> 21:01.041
She's a bitch
and she's a control freak

21:01.083 --> 21:02.041
and she's a turncoat.

21:02.083 --> 21:03.542
A turncoat?
In AA,

21:03.583 --> 21:05.750
the old-timers tell you to keep
your mouth shut at work.

21:05.792 --> 21:07.959
They tell you not to break
your anonymity to anyone,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.041
especially if you are
a doctor or a lawyer

21:10.083 --> 21:11.834
or a pilot
or anything where anyone

21:11.875 --> 21:13.917
could use your admission
of addiction against you.

21:13.959 --> 21:15.500
They tell you
to keep your mouth shut,

21:15.542 --> 21:17.333
even if you have been sober
for 20 years,

21:17.375 --> 21:19.041
because people
don't understand.

21:19.083 --> 21:21.041
I didn't listen.
I opened my mouth.

21:21.083 --> 21:22.625
I opened my mouth

21:22.667 --> 21:24.458
because Charlotte needed me
to open my mouth.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.500
After her rape,
she needed me.

21:27.917 --> 21:30.875
Look, one in ten people
is an alcoholic or an addict.

21:30.917 --> 21:32.792
And only one in ten
of those people

21:32.834 --> 21:34.083
even tries to get help.

21:34.125 --> 21:36.291
I have been sober for years,
and I am sober again.

21:36.333 --> 21:38.667
But do I get any credit
from Charlotte? No.

21:38.709 --> 21:40.041
Because I made the mistake

21:40.083 --> 21:41.917
of helping her
when she needed me,

21:41.959 --> 21:44.041
and because I had a few drinks
over a month ago,

21:44.083 --> 21:46.083
I am benched.
No credit, no gratitude.

21:46.125 --> 21:48.709
So the answer to your debate,
Sheldon, is everyone.

21:48.750 --> 21:51.917
I am in here
hiding from everyone.

21:51.959 --> 21:54.375
( tense theme playing )

21:56.500 --> 21:57.750
( chip clatters )

22:04.083 --> 22:06.500
So you're gonna feel
a little bit of warmth

22:06.542 --> 22:08.834
as the medicine goes in.

22:08.875 --> 22:10.208
KERRI:
That feels weird.

22:10.250 --> 22:13.375
COOPER:
Yeah, it should go away
in just a minute.

22:13.417 --> 22:15.542
KERRI:
I'm going to get better now?

22:15.583 --> 22:17.041
Well, that is the idea.

22:17.083 --> 22:18.750
CHARLOTTE:
Cooper.

22:18.792 --> 22:20.375
I saw your name
on the procedure list.

22:20.417 --> 22:22.041
What are you doing?

22:22.083 --> 22:23.709
Giving Kerri
a chance to live.

22:23.750 --> 22:26.375
But where'd you
get the cord blood?

22:26.417 --> 22:29.709
Oh, a donor match came
through the registry.

22:29.750 --> 22:31.041
Consent form's on your desk.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.000
CHARLOTTE:
I'm glad it all worked out.

22:34.041 --> 22:35.333
Amazing, right?

22:52.917 --> 22:54.250
There's a word for this,
you know,

22:54.291 --> 22:56.208
you and I running
into one another.

22:56.250 --> 22:58.458
Yeah, the word you're
looking for is "nerve."

22:58.500 --> 23:00.834
The nerve of you
coming into my practice,

23:00.875 --> 23:02.041
wasting my time,

23:02.083 --> 23:04.166
when clearly,
you have ulterior motives.

23:04.208 --> 23:05.166
Whoa. Hold on a second.

23:05.208 --> 23:07.041
You think I came in
for a job interview

23:07.083 --> 23:09.041
just to get you
to go out with me?

23:09.083 --> 23:10.041
It's very convenient.

23:10.083 --> 23:11.333
Actually, it is.

23:11.375 --> 23:14.041
Your practice is already
affiliated with St. Ambrose,

23:14.083 --> 23:16.041
which is where I see
most of my patients,

23:16.083 --> 23:18.083
not to mention, you're only
a 15-minute walk

23:18.125 --> 23:19.208
from my house,

23:19.250 --> 23:21.500
so you'll be helping me
to reduce my carbon footprint.

23:21.542 --> 23:22.875
Heh. That's rich.

23:22.917 --> 23:25.041
I hate to burst your bubble
over there, Dr. Montgomery,

23:25.083 --> 23:26.291
but, uh, I'm a catch.

23:26.333 --> 23:28.208
And so humble.
All I'm saying is

23:28.250 --> 23:30.625
there are plenty of
beautiful, intelligent women

23:30.667 --> 23:32.041
I could be with
if I wanted to be.

23:32.083 --> 23:33.834
Do you really think
I tracked you down,

23:33.875 --> 23:35.208
pretended to be
interested in a job,

23:35.250 --> 23:37.041
put myself through
the interview process,

23:37.083 --> 23:39.166
just to get a date with you?

23:39.208 --> 23:42.041
Though I will say,
having a friendly face

23:42.083 --> 23:43.625
around here
is a selling point.

23:43.667 --> 23:44.625
Oh, we are not friends.

23:44.667 --> 23:46.458
I was talking about Sam.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.083
Oh, it was
intramural basketball.

23:48.125 --> 23:51.000
It's not like
you two climbed Everest.

23:52.125 --> 23:54.041
PETE: Hey.
Hey.

23:54.083 --> 23:55.458
How's it going
with the hiring?

23:55.500 --> 23:57.125
Oh, well,
we found a guy we like.

23:57.166 --> 23:59.333
Amazing credentials,
a great work history.

23:59.375 --> 24:00.834
And?

24:00.875 --> 24:02.500
And Addison
doesn't like him.

24:02.542 --> 24:05.000
Well, since when does she
make the final decisions?

24:06.083 --> 24:08.041
I know there've been
changes around here,

24:08.083 --> 24:10.125
but we're still
a cooperative practice, right?

24:10.166 --> 24:12.250
Officially, no. Officially,

24:12.291 --> 24:14.834
we all work for Addison and
answer to Addison.

24:14.875 --> 24:17.041
We agreed to that
to keep the doors open,

24:17.083 --> 24:18.959
for the medical board.
I mean,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.041
we had to make changes
on paper, I get it.

24:21.083 --> 24:23.458
But does that mean we don't
make decisions together anymore?

24:23.500 --> 24:25.500
If that's what it means--
Pete, take it easy.

24:25.542 --> 24:27.083
No, are you guys
just gonna roll over

24:27.125 --> 24:29.041
and let her push us around?

24:29.083 --> 24:30.917
( Pete scoffs )

24:30.959 --> 24:32.041
It's just like
with the boxes.

24:32.083 --> 24:33.959
She doesn't respect
any one of us.

24:35.083 --> 24:37.250
Someone didn't get
enough sleep last night.

24:37.291 --> 24:39.041
I don't think
sleep is the issue.

24:39.083 --> 24:40.917
Well, he's had
major heart surgery.

24:40.959 --> 24:42.917
There's no way
his body's 100 percent.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.917
I wasn't talking about
his physical health.

24:44.959 --> 24:46.875
It's only been a month
since his heart attack.

24:46.917 --> 24:48.667
Not only is he dealing
with mortality issues,

24:48.709 --> 24:50.542
but he's in emotional
overload.

24:50.583 --> 24:52.291
You know,
fear, depression, guilt,

24:52.333 --> 24:53.917
they're all colliding.

24:53.959 --> 24:55.625
No wonder he's so frustrated.

24:55.667 --> 24:57.041
It's not just frustration.

24:57.083 --> 25:00.166
He's angry.
It's a typical response.

25:00.208 --> 25:02.583
So, what do we do?
Cut the guy some slack,

25:02.625 --> 25:04.375
give him some space
to work out his issues,

25:04.417 --> 25:07.166
and in time,
he'll find his equilibrium.

25:14.083 --> 25:16.625
Hey.
Hey. What's happening?

25:16.667 --> 25:19.417
What's the, uh, inside scoop
on the hiring situation?

25:19.458 --> 25:21.291
( Sam chuckles )

25:21.333 --> 25:24.166
Still doing interviews,
checking references.

25:24.208 --> 25:25.834
You know how
this process works.

25:25.875 --> 25:27.041
Yeah, don't sweat it.

25:27.083 --> 25:29.458
You'll know
when you know, right?

25:29.500 --> 25:32.667
Listen, I'm gonna go grab
a beer later on

25:32.709 --> 25:34.458
with some of the doctors
from the practice.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.041
You want to join,
meet a few of them?

25:36.083 --> 25:37.458
Sounds good.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.291
Cool.
I'll check you later.

25:41.083 --> 25:43.041
How dare you people
do this to us?

25:43.083 --> 25:44.875
And you are?
Robert Weston.

25:44.917 --> 25:47.041
You used my son's cord blood
without my permission.

25:47.083 --> 25:49.000
Uh, we have
your signed consent.

25:54.083 --> 25:55.959
That's not my signature.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.542
Well, there's been
a misunderstanding.

25:57.583 --> 26:00.291
I told Dr. Freedman that he
couldn't use Kip's cord blood.

26:00.333 --> 26:02.375
But after he left our house,
I was concerned,

26:02.417 --> 26:03.500
so I called the hospital.

26:03.542 --> 26:05.083
It turns out
you used it on a patient.

26:05.125 --> 26:07.458
That is not your blood to take.
You need to believe me.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.667
I'll deal with this
and Dr. Freedman.

26:09.709 --> 26:11.250
So will my lawyers.

26:11.291 --> 26:14.250
( tense theme playing )

26:18.709 --> 26:21.625
Hey.
We let you into our home,

26:21.667 --> 26:23.041
listened to you
plead your case.

26:23.083 --> 26:24.458
What did it get us?
I understand.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.875
And what I did,

26:25.917 --> 26:28.041
you have every right to think
I'm a terrible person.

26:28.083 --> 26:29.834
If you knew Kerri,
this beautiful little girl

26:29.875 --> 26:31.625
whose life you saved,

26:31.667 --> 26:33.041
you would understand
why I did it.

26:33.083 --> 26:35.083
You stole from us. You stole the
only thing

26:35.125 --> 26:36.834
that was left
from our dead son.

26:36.875 --> 26:39.667
And now,
you've given it away.

26:39.709 --> 26:42.500
We can never get that back.

26:42.542 --> 26:44.542
( dramatic theme playing )

26:47.709 --> 26:49.542
( mellow theme playing )

26:54.917 --> 26:56.417
I was just about to call you.
Look at this.

26:56.458 --> 26:58.041
Kerri's blood count.

26:58.083 --> 27:00.041
There is no evidence of any
abnormal white blood cells.

27:00.083 --> 27:01.500
It's working.
How great is that?

27:01.542 --> 27:03.917
Did you really think
you'd get away with it?

27:05.333 --> 27:07.917
Charlotte--
I checked my computer.

27:07.959 --> 27:11.166
You used my password to access
our private blood bank?

27:11.208 --> 27:12.583
Will you let me explain this?

27:12.625 --> 27:14.166
Do you realize
what you've done?

27:14.208 --> 27:16.000
I saved this little girl's
life,

27:16.041 --> 27:18.000
which is the right thing to do--
Don't you dare.

27:18.041 --> 27:19.500
I was not gonna sit
and watch her die.

27:19.542 --> 27:21.291
We've been through this,
Cooper.

27:21.333 --> 27:23.041
You don't get to
make up the rules

27:23.083 --> 27:25.041
every time
a patient needs your help.

27:25.083 --> 27:27.375
We're all doctors.
We all love our patients.

27:27.417 --> 27:29.041
Charlotte, don't--
You broke the law,

27:29.083 --> 27:30.792
and you broke my trust.

27:30.834 --> 27:33.083
You're a doctor,
and you're an adult,

27:33.125 --> 27:34.542
and you're my husband,

27:34.583 --> 27:36.125
and you didn't act like
any of those things

27:36.166 --> 27:38.291
when you
made this decision.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.125
You have no self-control,
and I am tired of it.

27:46.125 --> 27:48.125
( upbeat soul music playing )

27:54.417 --> 27:56.792
So you're a dad, huh?
Good for you, Sam.

27:56.834 --> 27:58.333
Yeah.

27:58.375 --> 28:00.792
( slurring ):
He's a granddad.
Man, can you believe that?

28:00.834 --> 28:03.041
What about you, any kids?

28:03.083 --> 28:05.000
Never had the time
to make any.

28:05.041 --> 28:07.750
Me neither,
but we love to try.

28:07.792 --> 28:09.583
Wow. Someone's not
pacing themselves.

28:09.625 --> 28:11.041
Self-control's overrated.

28:11.083 --> 28:13.041
I'll drink to that.

28:13.083 --> 28:15.583
I like you. I like him.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.417
Why haven't we hired him yet?

28:18.458 --> 28:19.417
SAM:
You know why.

28:19.458 --> 28:20.959
We have to do
our due diligence

28:21.000 --> 28:23.333
to the other applicants.
Yeah, right.

28:23.375 --> 28:25.041
You sound like a guy
in the know,

28:25.083 --> 28:27.625
so, what do I gotta do
to get this guy on board?

28:27.667 --> 28:29.625
Well, I would start
with this guy's girlfriend.

28:29.667 --> 28:31.875
Mm. All right.
That's it. You're cut off.

28:31.917 --> 28:33.875
Whoop. Aw!

28:33.917 --> 28:35.166
SAM:
I have to take a leak.

28:35.208 --> 28:37.875
Addison.
Addison's your ticket.

28:41.834 --> 28:43.625
Dr. Montgomery
is your girlfriend?

28:43.667 --> 28:45.166
Yeah. Yeah, we don't have

28:45.208 --> 28:48.041
a non-fraternization policy
at the office, so...

28:48.083 --> 28:50.458
She seems great.

28:50.500 --> 28:52.041
You're a lucky guy.

28:52.083 --> 28:54.125
Thank you.
Thank you.

28:56.458 --> 28:57.834
I left messages
for the Westons.

28:57.875 --> 28:59.250
I'm hoping to talk to them

28:59.291 --> 29:01.542
before I need to
bring this to the board.

29:01.583 --> 29:03.041
Yeah, I'll keep you informed.

29:03.083 --> 29:04.208
Oh, hey,
you have a minute?

29:04.250 --> 29:05.875
Oh. I have had it
up to here

29:05.917 --> 29:07.917
with doctors playing fast
and loose with the rules.

29:07.959 --> 29:09.291
I got surgeons
sticking scalpels

29:09.333 --> 29:11.041
in people's brains
while drinking

29:11.083 --> 29:12.208
and doctors
stealing cord blood,

29:12.250 --> 29:14.208
so unless what you have to say
can change that,

29:14.250 --> 29:15.709
now is not a good time.

29:15.750 --> 29:17.166
I don't know anything
about cord blood,

29:17.208 --> 29:18.667
but as far as
one particular surgeon

29:18.709 --> 29:21.041
who drank on duty, I...

29:21.083 --> 29:23.417
Amelia is an excellent
surgeon.

29:23.458 --> 29:25.041
Her skill
is not in question.

29:25.083 --> 29:27.291
No, I know.
Only her sobriety.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.709
I'm not talking about this.
Then just listen.

29:29.750 --> 29:32.041
Look, I know
what Amelia did was wrong.

29:32.083 --> 29:33.959
But you care about her,
which means at some point,

29:34.000 --> 29:35.917
you're gonna have to stop
punishing her

29:35.959 --> 29:37.041
and start forgiving her.

29:37.083 --> 29:39.208
I'm chief of staff.
I can't make exceptions

29:39.250 --> 29:40.959
just because
I care about someone.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.709
I'm not saying you should,
just do it by the book.

29:43.750 --> 29:45.041
Let her take the test,

29:45.083 --> 29:47.041
check to see
if she's still drinking.

29:47.083 --> 29:48.000
She's an addict, Sheldon.

29:49.291 --> 29:52.208
Maybe. But if this were
any other surgeon,

29:52.250 --> 29:54.083
would you be holding her
to the same standard?

30:00.959 --> 30:02.000
Hey.

30:02.041 --> 30:03.041
Hey.
Grr.

30:03.083 --> 30:05.458
Ha-ha-ha.
Mwah.

30:05.500 --> 30:06.542
You're late.

30:06.583 --> 30:08.041
Boys' night out
must have been fun.

30:08.083 --> 30:10.458
Yeah, I wanted to make sure
Coop got home in one piece,

30:10.500 --> 30:12.458
so I had the cab
drop him off first.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.250
That drunk, huh?

30:14.291 --> 30:16.542
Uh, yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.

30:16.583 --> 30:18.542
Yeah?
But he had a good time, though.

30:18.583 --> 30:19.917
I had a good time.

30:19.959 --> 30:21.250
Jake had a good time too.

30:21.291 --> 30:22.709
Wait, Jake went?

30:22.750 --> 30:26.041
Yeah, I invited him.
He's cool.

30:26.083 --> 30:28.041
I think that you're wrong
about him.

30:28.083 --> 30:29.500
( sighs )

30:29.542 --> 30:31.917
I know that you don't think

30:31.959 --> 30:34.083
he's a good fit
for the practice,

30:34.125 --> 30:37.333
but he's a good doctor.

30:37.375 --> 30:39.917
He's a skilled doctor.

30:39.959 --> 30:43.709
And we all work
long, hard hours,

30:43.750 --> 30:46.041
and to have someone around
that everybody likes

30:46.083 --> 30:48.000
I think is a good thing.

30:48.041 --> 30:50.709
I know, I know
that you miss Naomi.

30:50.750 --> 30:52.500
I miss Naomi too.

30:52.542 --> 30:55.583
But I think
that you're wrong about him.

30:55.625 --> 30:57.083
Okay.
Okay.

30:57.125 --> 30:59.041
Can we stop now,
talking about Naomi and...?

30:59.083 --> 31:00.458
Sure.

31:00.500 --> 31:01.417
...Jake?

31:01.458 --> 31:03.625
Mm-hm.
Mm.

31:03.667 --> 31:06.000
Did you--?
Did you buy some condoms?

31:07.083 --> 31:09.041
You know
I don't like to wear those.

31:09.083 --> 31:12.250
I know, but this is not--
This is not about fashion, Sam.

31:12.291 --> 31:14.166
Okay, okay.
I'll be careful.

31:14.208 --> 31:16.041
I'll be careful.
I'll be real careful.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.333
No, no. Come on.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.667
We're not in high school

31:18.709 --> 31:22.834
in the back of my parents'
Mercedes, Sam.

31:25.458 --> 31:28.709
You know,
no glove, no love.

31:32.083 --> 31:33.834
I'm serious.

31:36.083 --> 31:37.417
( sighs )

31:43.917 --> 31:45.041
( knocks )

31:45.083 --> 31:47.875
Hey. Wow.

31:47.917 --> 31:49.291
That's a lot of pills.

31:49.333 --> 31:52.625
He's gonna have to take them
every day for a year.

31:52.667 --> 31:54.500
A year.

31:54.542 --> 31:57.041
Scary. The whole thing must be
terrifying to both of you.

31:57.083 --> 32:00.166
Uh, it's not terrifying,
Sheldon, it's, um...

32:01.417 --> 32:05.583
...life-altering,
wholly and completely.

32:05.625 --> 32:08.917
This kind of thing
changes everything.

32:10.375 --> 32:12.041
Will you talk about
something else?

32:12.083 --> 32:13.208
Really?
The reason I came in

32:13.250 --> 32:14.542
is to talk about Pete,

32:14.583 --> 32:16.208
and that I don't think
he's ready to be back.

32:16.250 --> 32:18.041
Think you're saying
anything I don't know?

32:18.083 --> 32:20.083
Think anything occupies my mind
right now except

32:20.125 --> 32:22.291
that he should not be here?
Okay. Something else.

32:22.333 --> 32:26.208
Uh, did you know that Sam
and Addison moved in together?

32:26.250 --> 32:27.917
And she still wants
to have a baby?

32:27.959 --> 32:29.917
She thinks she's gonna
compartmentalize Sam

32:29.959 --> 32:32.041
and her pregnancy plans and--

32:32.083 --> 32:34.041
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.

32:34.083 --> 32:38.291
So she wants to have a baby,
but not with Sam,

32:38.333 --> 32:39.667
who happens to be the guy

32:39.709 --> 32:41.083
she's living with
and sleeping with,

32:41.125 --> 32:43.041
and he doesn't
want to have a baby,

32:43.083 --> 32:45.709
so she's gonna have one
with a sperm donor?

32:45.750 --> 32:48.917
And she's gonna deal with IVF
and hormonal fluctuations,

32:48.959 --> 32:50.750
and at the same time,
take over the practice,

32:50.792 --> 32:52.458
so she's gonna
have to run this place

32:52.500 --> 32:55.000
and handle all of us and...

32:55.041 --> 32:56.667
How did you let this happen?

32:56.709 --> 32:58.041
Me?

32:58.083 --> 33:00.375
Well, I was home with Pete.
You couldn't have weighed in?

33:00.417 --> 33:01.625
You couldn't have advised

33:01.667 --> 33:03.083
against
this catastrophic decision

33:03.125 --> 33:05.959
that's ultimately going to
affect everyone who works here?

33:06.000 --> 33:07.709
No, this is a hazard
of our trade,

33:07.750 --> 33:09.583
this thing where we always
think six steps ahead.

33:09.625 --> 33:11.083
I mean, our friends
make decisions,

33:11.125 --> 33:12.542
and we're shrinks,

33:12.583 --> 33:15.041
so our brains automatically
analyze those decisions

33:15.083 --> 33:17.041
and project psychologically
based eventualities,

33:17.083 --> 33:20.125
most of which come true,
and we can't control that.

33:20.166 --> 33:22.959
But maybe we can control this,
or at least influence it.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.959
The only thing we can control
is whether or not

33:25.000 --> 33:27.792
we say what we're thinking
to our friends.

33:27.834 --> 33:30.750
And when we weigh in,
you know what happens?

33:30.792 --> 33:32.041
What happens is,

33:32.083 --> 33:34.041
they do
what they're gonna do anyway,

33:34.083 --> 33:36.583
because they're in love,
and because people are flawed,

33:36.625 --> 33:38.917
and because
human beings require pain

33:38.959 --> 33:40.333
in order to learn and grow--

33:40.375 --> 33:42.834
So you don't think there's
anything we could say to help?

33:42.875 --> 33:44.083
When you say
every shrink thought

33:44.125 --> 33:45.709
that you ever had out loud,

33:45.750 --> 33:48.375
you become
the "I told you so" friend.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.208
Doesn't help anybody.

33:54.250 --> 33:56.500
Excuse me.
Dr. Montgomery.

33:59.083 --> 34:01.041
You don't want me
to join the practice

34:01.083 --> 34:04.000
because Sam
is your boyfriend, right?

34:06.458 --> 34:08.375
How did you--?
Who told you?

34:08.417 --> 34:09.625
It doesn't matter.

34:09.667 --> 34:11.458
Did...?

34:11.500 --> 34:12.875
Did you say any--?

34:12.917 --> 34:16.041
No, I didn't say
anything about Fiji.

34:16.083 --> 34:17.667
Thank you.

34:17.709 --> 34:19.959
And just so you know,
when you invited me,

34:20.000 --> 34:21.625
Sam and I,
we were broken up.

34:21.667 --> 34:25.083
Just forget it, okay?
That whole thing.

34:25.125 --> 34:26.917
That whole thing?
This is awkward for me.

34:26.959 --> 34:28.291
You have to understand that.

34:28.333 --> 34:30.041
I'm not using you
as a fertility doctor,

34:30.083 --> 34:32.083
despite the fact that
you're the best in the city.

34:32.125 --> 34:34.834
That should tell you something.
Believe me when I say this.

34:34.875 --> 34:36.375
I like your practice
and the people in it,

34:36.417 --> 34:38.667
and that's all. And if you hire
me,

34:38.709 --> 34:40.041
I will never,
ever hit on you.

34:40.083 --> 34:42.000
I won't even look your way.

34:44.083 --> 34:46.041
Oh, and, uh, I joined

34:46.083 --> 34:48.041
the American Society
for Reproductive Medicine,

34:48.083 --> 34:50.125
so you're fresh
out of excuses.

35:01.750 --> 35:04.041
It's decaf.

35:04.083 --> 35:06.041
Great.

35:06.083 --> 35:08.083
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:08.125 --> 35:10.166
It's time for your meds.

35:14.709 --> 35:17.667
How are you?
Mm. Fine.

35:17.709 --> 35:19.041
I can see
that you're physically fine,

35:19.083 --> 35:20.458
but I was just wondering,

35:20.500 --> 35:22.083
how does it feel
to be back at work?

35:22.125 --> 35:23.667
Because I was
talking to Sheldon--

35:23.709 --> 35:25.041
You wanna know
how I feel?

35:25.083 --> 35:26.500
You wanna know
how I honestly feel?

35:26.542 --> 35:29.250
I feel like
I can't get away from you.

35:29.291 --> 35:31.333
I feel like
you're smothering me.

35:31.375 --> 35:34.041
Isn't it enough that you're
my wife and my nursemaid?

35:34.083 --> 35:36.542
You wanna be my shrink?
Go home, Violet.

35:36.583 --> 35:39.041
Go home
and be a mother to our son,

35:39.083 --> 35:40.709
because I don't
want you here!

35:40.750 --> 35:42.500
And you don't have patients!

35:42.542 --> 35:44.041
You don't have a license!

35:44.083 --> 35:48.041
You have no business here,
Violet. Go home!

35:49.500 --> 35:52.000
( tense theme playing )

35:57.500 --> 35:59.875
I know it must have been
difficult coming in here.

35:59.917 --> 36:01.125
You were certainly persistent.

36:01.166 --> 36:02.458
I thought
it might be helpful

36:02.500 --> 36:04.291
to explain the new protocols
we've put in place

36:04.333 --> 36:06.750
to prevent this
from happening in the future.

36:06.792 --> 36:08.709
Is that supposed
to make us feel better,

36:08.750 --> 36:10.583
you worked the kinks
out of the system?

36:10.625 --> 36:12.291
Uh, Robert,
let's just hear her out.

36:12.333 --> 36:14.041
No. This was a mistake.

36:14.083 --> 36:15.417
Dr. King?

36:15.458 --> 36:18.792
Dr. King, I just wanted
to say thank you

36:18.834 --> 36:21.041
for everything
you've done for Kerri.

36:21.083 --> 36:22.375
Do you have time to see her?

36:22.417 --> 36:24.041
Well, I was
showing the Westons out.

36:24.083 --> 36:25.792
As soon as I'm done.

36:25.834 --> 36:27.041
You're the parents.

36:27.083 --> 36:30.625
Oh, my God.

36:30.667 --> 36:32.250
I can't thank you enough.

36:33.875 --> 36:36.917
What you've done for my
family, for Kerri--

36:36.959 --> 36:38.583
How is she?

36:38.625 --> 36:41.542
She's, uh...
She's getting better.

36:41.583 --> 36:44.625
I don't even remember
the last time I said that.

36:44.667 --> 36:47.041
You know, I'm sure
she'd love to meet you.

36:47.083 --> 36:49.709
Please. Come on.

36:56.083 --> 36:58.041
How did you--?
Had nothing to do with me.

36:58.083 --> 37:00.208
I was just walking the Westons
to the elevator.

37:00.250 --> 37:02.166
They ran into each other.

37:05.166 --> 37:07.041
You know,
the elevator's actually--

37:07.083 --> 37:08.458
You were wrong, Cooper.

37:08.500 --> 37:11.709
Breaking into my computer,
stealing that cord blood.

37:11.750 --> 37:14.750
Regardless of the outcome,
you were wrong.

37:16.041 --> 37:18.083
You better pray Matt Weston
never needs that blood,

37:18.125 --> 37:20.083
because you're not God.

37:20.125 --> 37:22.083
It's not your job
to play God.

37:22.125 --> 37:23.375
Charlotte--

37:23.417 --> 37:25.291
I made this go away
because I love you.

37:25.333 --> 37:27.667
But if you ever
screw with me again,

37:27.709 --> 37:29.917
if you ever
cross me like this,

37:29.959 --> 37:32.083
I'll report you to the cops

37:32.125 --> 37:34.000
and let them throw
your sorry ass in jail.

37:37.083 --> 37:39.959
( tender theme playing )

37:46.959 --> 37:48.667
The fast one.

37:48.709 --> 37:50.667
Which one is faster,
truck or car?

37:50.709 --> 37:53.291
The truck...
Truck.

37:55.125 --> 37:56.709
( Lucas babbling )

37:56.750 --> 37:58.083
Yeah.

38:01.834 --> 38:03.208
So, um...

38:03.250 --> 38:05.041
Vroom.

38:05.083 --> 38:07.625
I don't know
what my job is anymore.

38:07.667 --> 38:10.041
As a doctor, your wife...

38:10.083 --> 38:11.291
I...

38:12.709 --> 38:15.125
I don't know what my job is,
but you're right

38:15.166 --> 38:18.041
that, um,
I can't be your therapist.

38:18.083 --> 38:22.917
So, that means that
you really need to get one.

38:22.959 --> 38:25.709
Because you were mean.

38:25.750 --> 38:27.917
You were really mean.

38:27.959 --> 38:31.041
And I will be your wife,
and I will be your nursemaid,

38:31.083 --> 38:34.917
as much as neither of us
likes it, but...

38:34.959 --> 38:37.291
I'm not gonna be
your punching bag.

38:37.333 --> 38:40.375
So you need someone
to talk to

38:41.709 --> 38:43.959
about whatever it is
you're going through.

38:47.041 --> 38:48.709
You need help.

38:54.417 --> 38:57.208
Okay, buddy.
It's bedtime.

38:57.250 --> 38:59.291
Want me to carry you?

38:59.333 --> 39:01.000
Night-night, Daddy.

39:02.125 --> 39:03.709
Can you say night-night?

39:03.750 --> 39:06.291
Night-night.
Night-night.

39:06.333 --> 39:09.333
( mellow pop music playing )

39:22.542 --> 39:23.834
What is that?

39:23.875 --> 39:26.166
A breathalyzer.
Blow into it.

39:26.208 --> 39:27.667
What?

39:27.709 --> 39:29.041
It was your idea.

39:29.083 --> 39:31.250
You wanna be on next week's
surgical rotation, right?

39:40.709 --> 39:42.709
( beeps )

39:45.792 --> 39:47.917
You're back on the schedule.

39:49.291 --> 39:51.000
Thanks.

39:52.291 --> 39:55.041
You know, I was gonna go
to a meeting on my way home.

39:55.083 --> 39:56.667
Headed to one myself.

39:56.709 --> 39:59.041
There's one near Ocean Park.
If we left now, we could--

39:59.083 --> 40:00.917
Thanks,
but I'd rather go solo.

40:12.291 --> 40:14.417
Hey, sorry I'm late.

40:14.458 --> 40:15.583
Mm.

40:15.625 --> 40:17.417
I picked up some dinner
on the way home.

40:17.458 --> 40:19.792
Oh, good.
I'm starving.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.083
Hey.
Hi.

40:22.709 --> 40:26.000
Um... So I hired Jake.

40:27.959 --> 40:29.041
Really?

40:29.083 --> 40:30.375
Yeah.
I thought about it,

40:30.417 --> 40:33.208
and it's the right thing
to do.

40:33.250 --> 40:35.750
Hmm. Oh, uh... Ha, ha.

40:35.792 --> 40:38.041
I picked those up.

40:38.083 --> 40:39.083
( chuckles )

40:39.125 --> 40:41.208
Mm-hm.

40:41.250 --> 40:42.542
Sam.

40:42.583 --> 40:45.875
I thought about it, and
it's the right thing to do.

40:54.083 --> 40:56.667
Oh. Do you hear that?

40:56.709 --> 40:58.250
I don't hear a thing.

40:58.291 --> 41:00.750
( whispers ):
I know.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.083
No music.
Mm-mm.

41:02.125 --> 41:07.083
No party.
No hot guy stumbling home.

41:07.125 --> 41:09.500
Amelia must have had
a long day.

41:09.542 --> 41:11.709
Finally, some peace and quiet
for us tonight.

41:11.750 --> 41:13.291
Mm.

41:13.333 --> 41:15.542
Hmm.
Mm, mm.

41:15.583 --> 41:17.000
( chuckles )

41:41.083 --> 41:43.250
I cheated on Derek.

41:45.083 --> 41:47.041
That's why he moved
to the woods.

41:47.083 --> 41:49.041
I slept with his best friend,
he caught us,

41:49.083 --> 41:53.709
he physically removed me
from our apartment in Manhattan,

41:53.750 --> 41:56.083
and he moved to the woods.

41:56.125 --> 41:58.083
But I didn't cheat on Sam.

41:58.125 --> 42:01.166
No, I met Jake
when Sam and I were broken up.

42:01.208 --> 42:02.667
So there's nothing to confess.

42:02.709 --> 42:04.625
There's no reason
to be scared.

42:04.667 --> 42:09.417
I don't wanna lose Sam,
but, no, I'm not scared.

42:09.458 --> 42:11.417
I'm...

42:11.458 --> 42:15.041
Wow. Okay, I may be
delusional, but, heh...

42:15.083 --> 42:17.166
I swear to God,

42:18.291 --> 42:22.208
for the first time
in a long time,

42:22.250 --> 42:24.083
I'm happy.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
( mellow theme playing )
