01:40.287 --> 01:42.926
-Good morning, William.
-Good morning, Mr Bullock. 

01:43.007 --> 01:46.044
-Are you sometimes permitted coffee?
-Yes, sir.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.445
About a third of a cup?

01:49.127 --> 01:50.845
Completed with cow's milk.

01:52.927 --> 01:54.121
As to sugar...

01:54.927 --> 01:56.121
three spoons?

01:59.167 --> 02:01.681
ls this the morning, William,
do you suppose...

02:01.767 --> 02:05.885
the tip of this lamp, like an lndian spear,
goes into the top of my head?

02:07.807 --> 02:09.205
l don't know, sir.

02:16.447 --> 02:19.041
Does it stand comparison
with your mother's?

02:19.127 --> 02:20.401
No, sir.

02:21.687 --> 02:23.996
Stiffened with a further lace of sugar?

02:26.127 --> 02:29.244
l mean that he would make it, sir.
My father would.

02:34.687 --> 02:36.598
Do you have time to sit a bit?

02:37.127 --> 02:40.563
l suppose l might do, having chopped
the kindling last evening.

02:50.487 --> 02:53.047
Would you tell me
about your father, William?

02:53.247 --> 02:55.966
l didn't know my brother so well
as you had a chance to.

02:56.047 --> 02:59.801
l was nine when Robert left our home.
l think you knew him longer.

02:59.887 --> 03:01.479
You were 1 1 .

03:02.167 --> 03:03.805
l knew him pretty well.

03:04.287 --> 03:06.118
What did he like doing best?

03:11.487 --> 03:12.966
Sometimes he'd sing.

03:13.887 --> 03:16.037
Not army songs, but other kinds.

03:16.887 --> 03:18.525
He'd make Mother laugh.

03:20.167 --> 03:22.635
He made the best duck calls of anyone.

03:22.727 --> 03:24.558
He would send away for the wood...

03:24.647 --> 03:28.845
and he taught me comebacks
and feeder calls and hails.

03:38.487 --> 03:41.285
Mr Utter and l
have some camp business to see to.

03:43.287 --> 03:44.606
William...

03:46.127 --> 03:47.845
are you a good duck caller?

03:47.927 --> 03:50.999
l suppose l'm pretty good.
l could show you, sir.

03:51.087 --> 03:53.157
l know of some potholes
over Belle Fourche way...

03:53.247 --> 03:54.521
that are pretty good for ducks.

03:54.607 --> 03:55.835
All right, sir.

04:00.287 --> 04:02.039
Goodbye, Mr Bullock.

04:10.287 --> 04:11.879
E.B. Farnum, Al.

04:12.567 --> 04:13.795
Come in, E.B.!

04:16.207 --> 04:19.199
l've been prostrated
by the agonies of the damned.

04:20.406 --> 04:22.443
Judgement is upon us then.

04:23.167 --> 04:24.998
A molar rotted through.

04:25.087 --> 04:27.760
Distressing me also,
that you are my eyes and ears...

04:27.847 --> 04:31.237
and a day as eventful as yesterday
should find you indisposed.

04:31.607 --> 04:34.883
Some solace in knowing l'm missed.

04:34.967 --> 04:37.800
You missed the advent
of the fucking telegraph operator...

04:37.887 --> 04:39.639
that had you steered into
one of your rooms...

04:39.727 --> 04:41.206
you could have kept tabs on henceforth.

04:41.287 --> 04:43.005
The pain nearly killed me.

04:43.447 --> 04:45.199
As you still breathe amongst us...

04:45.287 --> 04:48.120
l shall ask you to befriend
this fucking Russian.

04:48.207 --> 04:50.960
-Russian?
-The fucking telegraph operator, E.B...

04:51.047 --> 04:52.844
is a fucking Russian.

04:53.407 --> 04:56.763
Of course l'll befriend him.
l'm very fond of Russians.

04:56.847 --> 04:58.997
And as the trust between you deepens...

04:59.087 --> 05:03.956
we'll be particularly interested
in messages to and from Yankton.

05:04.047 --> 05:05.162
Yeah?

05:06.487 --> 05:07.840
Sorry, E.B.

05:09.407 --> 05:11.637
Al, you might wanna
take a gander at that.

05:11.727 --> 05:14.480
E.B. is leaving. You won't miss him.

05:14.887 --> 05:17.606
He's living at Merrick's
and looks like the prize at a carnival.

05:17.687 --> 05:20.679
What a delightful image
to carry away with me!

05:33.047 --> 05:37.677
Swearengen's put the paperman's boat
to sea with a hold full of fucking bullshit.

05:40.687 --> 05:43.963
-He wants $5,000 more upstairs.
-Jesus Christ!

05:45.647 --> 05:48.923
Tell that fat bastard he can come down
and get it hisself.

05:49.607 --> 05:51.359
He says it's $100 if l bring it up.

05:51.447 --> 05:54.917
ls the $5,000 you already brought him in
any kind of action, Tess?

05:55.127 --> 05:57.846
lt's just for him to look at
while he fucks you!

05:57.967 --> 05:59.082
So...

05:59.487 --> 06:03.162
do l want my $8, Tess,
of the $9 he pays for the fuck...

06:03.247 --> 06:06.159
and my $90 of the $100 he gives you
to bring it up to him...

06:06.247 --> 06:08.715
or do l want to give fat boy
the opportunity...

06:08.807 --> 06:11.162
if he has to come down
to get the other $5,000...

06:11.247 --> 06:15.399
to test his luck on the floor here
amongst the games of chance?

06:15.687 --> 06:16.722
l see.

06:16.807 --> 06:21.676
And don't mistake me, honey. l want to
take the time to explain myself to you.

06:22.167 --> 06:25.523
We've come to see Mose Manuel
about his brother getting shot.

06:29.007 --> 06:30.963
Fetch Mose Manuel, Tess.

06:31.527 --> 06:32.880
Tell him...

06:33.207 --> 06:36.165
Sheriff Bullock wants to
pay his condolences here...

06:36.247 --> 06:38.078
amongst the games of chance.

06:45.447 --> 06:48.837
All these rumours, Sheriff,
swirling around you.

06:48.927 --> 06:51.077
How do you keep your hat on?

06:51.647 --> 06:55.799
lf you'll sign right here, ma'am.
And give us a A.G. in the corner.

06:58.007 --> 07:01.363
ls that abbreviation a term of art
in financial transactions?

07:01.447 --> 07:03.836
Ought l acquaint myself
with its meaning?

07:04.127 --> 07:06.960
That abbreviation, ma'am,
is your initials.

07:11.367 --> 07:14.564
And by asking the whereabouts
of the currency l signed for receiving...

07:14.647 --> 07:17.241
do l reveal an even deeper stupidity?

07:17.487 --> 07:20.285
The coach from Denver
should get in today.

07:21.447 --> 07:24.678
And the safe we've purchased
to be housed in the bank we're to build?

07:24.767 --> 07:26.723
lt's inside the coach as well.

07:26.807 --> 07:28.160
Safe's inside the coach...

07:28.247 --> 07:31.398
and the currency is inside the safe
is the full picture.

07:32.247 --> 07:35.364
-There, l did manage to be stupid.
-No, ma'am.

07:37.047 --> 07:39.766
And you will see to the safe's
temporary situation...

07:39.847 --> 07:41.519
at the Star & Bullock Hardware Store?

07:41.607 --> 07:42.801
Yes, ma'am.

07:42.887 --> 07:46.243
Gaze averted from the awkwardness
such a situation generates.

07:46.647 --> 07:50.322
Fixing my eyes instead on its pluses
securing your money.

07:51.487 --> 07:53.398
Excellent then, Mr Ellsworth.

07:55.847 --> 07:58.520
May l further impose on you
to convey this letter?

07:58.607 --> 07:59.926
Of course.

08:00.887 --> 08:02.366
Mr Swearengen?

08:02.887 --> 08:04.081
Please!

08:04.487 --> 08:05.806
All right.

08:06.527 --> 08:09.087
ls there anything else for us to discuss?

08:09.167 --> 08:10.486
Not at this time.

08:14.767 --> 08:16.086
l'll be going then.

08:27.887 --> 08:30.765
-Who's that?
-lt's Joanie Stubbs.

08:30.887 --> 08:32.842
You're outside my place.

08:35.207 --> 08:38.357
Keeping half-assed vigil after the fact.

08:38.447 --> 08:40.517
Well, come in
and tell me what you mean.

08:43.366 --> 08:44.925
No, that's all right.

08:47.367 --> 08:49.597
That cocksucker you spoke to me of...

08:49.687 --> 08:52.599
come from here last night
with a bloody fucking mug.

08:52.687 --> 08:54.643
-l gave it to him.
-Good.

08:58.887 --> 09:01.959
Anyways, he told me at rifle point...

09:03.127 --> 09:04.560
you was okay.

09:04.647 --> 09:08.401
-l am.
-l knew if he was lying you was dead...

09:08.487 --> 09:11.285
and feared finding you so
in the darkness.

09:12.287 --> 09:16.166
-Scared that way since l was small.
-Well, come on in, Jane.

09:18.567 --> 09:22.685
lf you was alive,
why fucking knock was my thinking.

09:22.767 --> 09:25.600
lnterfere with you getting to sleep...

09:25.687 --> 09:28.485
-or being asleep already--
-Jane, it's nippy on my twat.

09:28.567 --> 09:30.478
All right then, see you later!

09:30.767 --> 09:33.235
Do you remember
you were in here yesterday?

09:33.567 --> 09:36.764
-Yes, l fucking remember.
-Well, why not come in again?

09:37.647 --> 09:39.399
Maybe l just fucking might.

09:39.887 --> 09:41.081
Hey, hey, hey.

09:43.407 --> 09:46.001
Nigger General's got a wild horse
on his hands.

09:49.127 --> 09:53.405
l pity the brute beast who pits his
cunning against the Nigger General's!

09:53.847 --> 09:54.882
Oh, shit!

09:57.327 --> 10:01.081
We can catch the cavalry before they
head south and sell him for $100!

10:01.167 --> 10:03.044
But they want their horses cut.

10:03.127 --> 10:04.355
Where'd you catch him?

10:04.447 --> 10:07.200
l sprung a rope fence behind him
in a box canyon.

10:07.367 --> 10:11.360
He'd escaped the Sioux, but his path
crossed an in-season mare's.

10:13.207 --> 10:16.961
Now l can nut him, but the moon
is wrong and he's gonna take it badly.

10:17.047 --> 10:20.517
Fuck, l ain't losing my chance at $100
waiting on no fucking moon!

10:20.607 --> 10:23.724
Okay. Here, put your hands
right here, okay.

10:23.807 --> 10:25.957
Hey! Come on.

10:26.887 --> 10:30.084
-Wash him so he won't fester.
-Hey, l got him.

10:30.167 --> 10:32.397
All right. Come here, boy. Come here.

10:33.167 --> 10:34.885
Now, if you want to take it out
on someone...

10:34.967 --> 10:38.846
remember it was very dark-skinned
white folks that cut on you.

10:38.927 --> 10:41.316
They just sounded like niggers
to throw you off.

10:41.407 --> 10:43.045
This one's a ''D.''

10:44.327 --> 10:46.124
And this one's a ''G.''

10:46.847 --> 10:48.519
And what's the first one?

10:48.687 --> 10:49.676
''D''?

10:49.767 --> 10:53.521
''Sheriff Bullock declines comment
on the swirl of rumours...

10:53.607 --> 10:57.156
''that parties in Helena with whom
he has had long association...

10:57.247 --> 11:02.241
''are keenly interested in annexing
our camp to the Montana territories.

11:02.927 --> 11:06.681
"The Pioneer also learns of interests
more developed and advanced...

11:06.767 --> 11:08.564
''on the part of Wyoming.''

11:08.647 --> 11:10.683
You knew Cheyenne
would be heard from.

11:10.767 --> 11:12.723
Get the fuck up off them steps!

11:14.367 --> 11:16.437
Here's where it gets really fucking busy.

11:16.527 --> 11:20.918
''And of an offer secretly proffered by
certain elements in Washington, D.C...

11:21.007 --> 11:23.441
''to annex to America
these our beloved hills...

11:23.527 --> 11:25.518
''as a separate freestanding territory...

11:25.607 --> 11:27.484
''with an eye towards
eventual statehood.''

11:27.567 --> 11:29.922
Making Deadwood
fucking headquarters.

11:30.007 --> 11:31.838
Don't spread your legs for them
just yet, Johnny.

11:31.927 --> 11:34.919
Not with Mexico to be heard from
and fucking France.

11:40.447 --> 11:41.675
There!

11:41.767 --> 11:44.201
One hundred extra copies, gentlemen...

11:44.287 --> 11:48.565
to satisfy the widened interest
l expect today's edition may generate.

11:49.127 --> 11:52.756
Wonderful, eh, Mr Blasanov?
One hundred copies extra.

11:53.127 --> 11:54.242
Okay.

11:54.327 --> 11:57.444
Shall we walk a bit,
my American and Russian friends?

11:57.527 --> 11:58.801
Shall we?

11:59.087 --> 12:01.840
l can't leave my apparatus.

12:01.927 --> 12:06.364
Are not all of us, Mr Blasanov,
tethered in some sense to our labours?

12:06.447 --> 12:08.165
And at some point in our lives...

12:08.247 --> 12:10.636
is not acceptance of that tethering...

12:10.727 --> 12:13.366
discovery of a path to joy?

12:14.607 --> 12:15.756
Don't know, Mister--

12:15.847 --> 12:18.361
And does not the very knowing
we are tethered allow us...

12:18.447 --> 12:22.406
in conscience upon occasion,
the rejuvenating pleasures of respite?

12:22.487 --> 12:24.523
Take your walk alone, A.W.

12:25.167 --> 12:29.445
For l confess l'm mesmerised
by Mr Blasanov's machine...

12:30.007 --> 12:32.646
and hope he may explain its workings.

12:32.727 --> 12:35.400
-Has Al seen The Pioneer?
-l don't know.

12:35.487 --> 12:37.443
A mystery you should seek to solve.

12:40.567 --> 12:42.922
-Good day.
-Good day, miss.

12:43.007 --> 12:45.282
A.W. Merrick of The Deadwood Pioneer.

12:45.367 --> 12:47.927
-l wish to send a telegram.
-A telegram. Yes, of course.

12:48.007 --> 12:50.316
Then that's Mr Blasanov there you seek.

12:53.087 --> 12:56.363
How do you do? Blasanov. Cheyenne
and Black Hills Telegraph Company.

12:56.447 --> 12:57.482
How do you do?

12:57.567 --> 12:59.319
-Miss lsringhausen.
-Mr Farnum.

12:59.407 --> 13:01.045
l wish this message sent.

13:01.127 --> 13:02.480
Oh, of course.

13:02.727 --> 13:06.117
l have a form for you to write on.
Please.

13:15.167 --> 13:19.479
You seem uncowed
by Mr Blasanov's apparatus.

13:20.047 --> 13:23.039
-Are you initiate in its mysteries?
-Fuck off.

13:24.327 --> 13:25.521
Please.

13:25.607 --> 13:26.926
Ah, gentlemen!

13:31.167 --> 13:32.486
What news?

13:33.207 --> 13:36.802
This ink-stained wretch has just
produced an overrun of 100 copies.

13:36.887 --> 13:39.401
Dan, don't you agree that the truth...

13:39.487 --> 13:44.038
if only a pinch, must season every
falsehood, or the palate fucking rebels?

13:44.407 --> 13:48.036
And mustn't the novice chef be mindful
not to ladle out his concoction...

13:48.127 --> 13:51.597
by the unseasoned fucking ton,
lest before he perfect his art...

13:51.687 --> 13:53.484
he lose his clientele?

14:00.407 --> 14:03.399
l'd like the ball scores
a little more fucking prompt.

14:04.527 --> 14:05.846
Excuse me.

14:10.087 --> 14:13.238
Al Swearengen, l would not go
into that office if l were you.

14:13.327 --> 14:15.045
Were you fucking born yesterday?

14:15.127 --> 14:18.358
No, sir, l was not.
l was not born yesterday!

14:18.447 --> 14:21.564
Then may we please
have a conversation as fucking adults?

14:21.647 --> 14:23.365
l think we'd better!

14:38.647 --> 14:40.239
l ain't waiting.

14:41.287 --> 14:42.356
Give this to him.

14:42.447 --> 14:46.042
Tell him whatever its import,
he'd best not serve the sender ill.

14:54.447 --> 14:56.483
He's in with Merrick, E.B.

14:56.607 --> 14:59.121
l bear news that don't want to wait.

15:01.127 --> 15:03.402
Every rumour you floated
in your article, Merrick...

15:03.487 --> 15:05.523
l believe is a living possibility
for this camp...

15:05.607 --> 15:07.802
and l want you to fucking hear that
as a compliment.

15:07.887 --> 15:09.639
lf so, it's the first from your lips.

15:09.727 --> 15:13.083
Because all them possibilities
called next to accomplished fact...

15:13.167 --> 15:15.886
in one fucking outgush
makes people smell a rat.

15:18.367 --> 15:19.595
Yes, l suppose so.

15:19.687 --> 15:23.123
These interests coming after us,
Merrick, they're fucking rough.

15:23.207 --> 15:24.799
They're going after our nuts.

15:24.887 --> 15:26.843
They're hypocrite cocksuckers.

15:26.927 --> 15:30.158
And the fucking lying tactics
and instruments...

15:30.247 --> 15:34.081
they use to fuck people up the ass
can be turned against them.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.476
My newspaper being
such an instrument.

15:36.567 --> 15:41.004
But scale, amount,
proportion, seasoning.

15:41.207 --> 15:43.243
Drink that fucking second shot, Merrick!

15:43.327 --> 15:47.081
-l like my fucking liquor.
-A trait in you that gave me early hope.

15:47.167 --> 15:49.158
l like stinking of fucking ink, too.

15:49.247 --> 15:51.636
-Give it a fucking smell, Al.
-No.

15:52.047 --> 15:54.766
So you enjoyed
writing your fucking article, huh?

15:56.167 --> 15:58.886
Worse ways to spend a night,
putting shoulder to a fucking idea.

15:58.967 --> 16:03.916
-Evidently, l put mine to over many.
-Pursued down over many avenues.

16:05.367 --> 16:08.279
The camp's welfare was the main idea.

16:10.687 --> 16:11.676
Al!

16:12.247 --> 16:15.364
Something strange has transpired
l need you to construe.

16:16.087 --> 16:17.236
What?

16:17.327 --> 16:19.079
-As l was--
-Come in!

16:21.687 --> 16:24.440
As l was befriending
the Russian operator...

16:25.167 --> 16:28.523
that woman tutor came
to send a telegram.

16:28.647 --> 16:32.845
We jockeyed a bit
as l sought a glance at its contents...

16:32.927 --> 16:35.999
and finally,
she shouted in so many words...

16:36.087 --> 16:38.647
and here is the strangeness in a tutor...

16:39.247 --> 16:41.203
to get the fuck away from her.

16:41.287 --> 16:45.041
Since the private part of this
meeting's over, Ellsworth brung it.

16:45.447 --> 16:48.803
-ln so many words.
-Where's the tutor now?

16:48.887 --> 16:52.800
Still with the operator, apparently
waiting for an answer to her message.

16:54.287 --> 16:56.005
Leave by the front entrance.

16:56.087 --> 16:59.523
Walk around for a few minutes
before you go back to your place.

17:13.007 --> 17:15.839
Bring that tutor up here.
The Russian, too.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.921
lt felt like something
you'd want to construe.

17:19.007 --> 17:22.282
-Go away, E.B.
-All right. Certainly.

17:58.327 --> 18:01.524
lt's the seeds from the sunflower
we had in Fort Quitman.

18:02.207 --> 18:05.836
Which l had in a jar which broke
and mice ate most of.

18:05.927 --> 18:07.883
So now l only have these three.

18:08.487 --> 18:12.162
-l didn't know you brought them.
-Mr Bullock's been missing Father.

18:12.487 --> 18:14.762
l talked to him about it this morning.

18:14.887 --> 18:19.119
As Papa liked the sunflower,
l thought Mr Bullock might as well.

18:22.207 --> 18:24.323
Then shall we plant those together?

18:24.687 --> 18:28.077
Press the soil firmly on them,
while l get the watering can.

18:39.127 --> 18:42.199
Maybe we should take Mr Bullock lunch
at his store.

18:44.967 --> 18:49.006
An accident befell my brother
is the sum of what l know...

18:49.087 --> 18:51.362
and be glad l choose to say it.

18:52.367 --> 18:55.598
Gutshot, at Nuttall's Number 10,
by his own hand?

18:56.807 --> 18:58.035
Correct.

18:58.887 --> 19:02.038
The day you sell out the claim
you two were partnered on?

19:02.567 --> 19:05.001
Correct, and fuck yourself.

19:05.087 --> 19:07.999
And don't act entitled to answers.

19:08.087 --> 19:10.157
Why was Charlie handling the gun?

19:10.567 --> 19:13.877
Fuck yourself, and don't act entitled.

19:14.327 --> 19:17.080
Why weren't you two watching
Nuttall's bike ride?

19:20.607 --> 19:21.756
Fuck yourself.

19:21.847 --> 19:24.077
l want to see his gun and his remains.

19:24.767 --> 19:26.405
Where is Charlie buried?

19:26.927 --> 19:28.121
My brother...

19:28.567 --> 19:31.877
is buried in a secret burial place...

19:33.247 --> 19:35.920
by his own private instructions!

19:36.007 --> 19:39.204
Jesus Christ, Bullock!
Put together a court or don't!

19:39.287 --> 19:42.484
-Quiet, you!
-Don't hush me in my own fucking joint.

19:42.567 --> 19:44.478
And if we take it outside, old man...

19:44.567 --> 19:47.161
expect a different outcome
from the other fucking day.

19:47.247 --> 19:51.445
You best have five of your fucking
cappers then with rifles at the ready.

19:51.527 --> 19:54.087
l got five and five behind them,
indoors or out.

19:54.167 --> 19:56.635
l, too, must report
to the Sheriff a death...

19:56.727 --> 20:00.436
a Cornishman at theft has been shot
in Mr Hearst's claim.

20:00.807 --> 20:03.037
-Killed?
-Yes, in flight.

20:03.127 --> 20:06.483
lt's all fucking amalgamation
and capital, ain't it, Wolcott?

20:06.567 --> 20:08.922
Mr Utter, are you a student of Hume?

20:09.607 --> 20:13.680
-Smith? A disciple of Karl Marx?
-Come on, Charlie.

20:13.767 --> 20:17.043
My employer, Mr Hearst, has interests
and connections in Montana, Sheriff...

20:17.127 --> 20:19.118
as are imputed to you
in this morning's Pioneer.

20:19.207 --> 20:21.198
-You shut your fucking mouth!
-Get him out of here!

20:21.287 --> 20:22.322
Down, Charlie!

20:22.407 --> 20:26.036
Sure got to you, didn't he, Mose?
Now he's got to get you to die!

20:26.647 --> 20:28.000
Come on, Charlie!

20:33.807 --> 20:35.081
Let me...

20:35.567 --> 20:38.035
get my arm through here so l can...

20:38.607 --> 20:40.199
secure my toast.

20:42.447 --> 20:45.200
You're gonna lift me
one time too fucking many!

20:45.287 --> 20:47.801
You don't go back in there if l let you go.

20:51.487 --> 20:54.285
-l'm leaving the whole fucking camp!
-Going where?

20:55.007 --> 20:58.886
A letter come to hand l need to take
to Bill's missus. Excuse me.

21:00.087 --> 21:01.759
Excuse me. Camp business.

21:02.367 --> 21:05.120
-He wrote just before he got killed.
-l see.

21:05.207 --> 21:07.357
And you know
who fucking give it to me?

21:07.447 --> 21:08.926
How crazy life got?

21:09.327 --> 21:12.717
And money must buy these bastards
any fucking thing they want!

21:13.127 --> 21:16.597
That cocksucker inside,
Mr Amalgamation & fucking Capital!

21:17.087 --> 21:19.396
Hearst's geologist gave you the letter?

21:21.287 --> 21:24.802
And God knows
who he fucking bought it off of.

21:26.207 --> 21:28.562
Or how many hands it passed through.

21:28.647 --> 21:30.160
lt fucks me up thinking Bill's missus...

21:30.247 --> 21:32.363
got to handle something
that cocksucker touched.

21:32.447 --> 21:35.245
Was it over the letter
you beat him the other day?

21:35.727 --> 21:36.921
No, no.

21:37.807 --> 21:39.126
Excuse me.

21:40.047 --> 21:42.959
No, l give my word not to say
what that was over.

21:44.087 --> 21:45.440
l'd best go.

21:45.527 --> 21:49.600
Lest Mr Amalgamation & Capital
takes one through the fucking head.

21:50.687 --> 21:52.917
What's the import of that expression?

21:53.807 --> 21:55.798
Do l look like l'd fucking know?

21:58.087 --> 22:01.716
Some big shot eastern magazine
reporter interviewing Bill said...

22:01.807 --> 22:04.116
that was what's changing things around.

22:05.967 --> 22:08.276
Jane. l don't know what's gonna
come of fucking Jane.

22:08.367 --> 22:09.686
l'll keep an eye on her.

22:09.767 --> 22:13.282
You should lock her in that cell
and don't let her fucking drink!

22:14.407 --> 22:16.443
And don't fuck yourself up
over Mose Manuel.

22:16.527 --> 22:18.563
He'll get hisself fleeced
of what's rightfully his...

22:18.647 --> 22:21.115
and what he got by fucking murder.

22:21.287 --> 22:23.676
He'll be judge on hisself and jury, too.

22:24.007 --> 22:26.077
Just like the fucking most of us.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.246
Coach from Denver.

22:33.487 --> 22:34.681
Here's yours.

22:41.287 --> 22:42.720
Good luck, Charlie!

22:50.487 --> 22:52.921
We've brought you and Mr Star lunch.

22:54.127 --> 22:55.446
Thank you.

23:25.087 --> 23:26.281
l'm up!

23:27.887 --> 23:29.559
You want the bath?

23:30.567 --> 23:32.478
l may well get to that.

23:38.527 --> 23:40.995
-Ample here, ain't it?
-Yeah.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.884
Formerly a cooperage.

23:43.687 --> 23:45.484
My friend Eddie that bought him out...

23:45.567 --> 23:48.525
said the man had been
a season ahead of himself.

23:49.367 --> 23:51.881
Well, lovely as it's fixed as a brothel...

23:51.967 --> 23:54.606
l expect you will reopen soon enough.

23:56.287 --> 23:58.005
Restock and reopen.

23:59.167 --> 24:01.362
You'd think so, wouldn't you?

24:14.927 --> 24:16.326
Stay awhile, Jane.

24:17.527 --> 24:18.676
Be my guest.

24:19.767 --> 24:21.246
Favour me and stay.

24:28.007 --> 24:29.998
l get top fucking dollar.

24:45.087 --> 24:47.282
New saloon in the camp, Jane?

24:47.847 --> 24:50.441
l know that's some clever
opening gambit...

24:50.527 --> 24:52.597
to culminate in breaking my balls.

24:54.167 --> 24:58.080
Just saying l checked the usual spots
'cause l wanted to say goodbye...

24:58.167 --> 25:02.001
before l left camp, so in case
you go ahead and fucking die--

25:02.087 --> 25:05.682
Goodbye, Charlie. Goodbye.
Have a good fucking trip.

25:05.767 --> 25:07.405
Shut the fuck up!

25:09.487 --> 25:12.240
'Cause it so happens, when you return...

25:12.567 --> 25:15.206
if no trees or animals killed you...

25:15.287 --> 25:17.926
you were fucking driving crazy
with criticism...

25:18.007 --> 25:20.521
you'll find l've moved out of this shitbox.

25:20.807 --> 25:22.638
So l don't have to fucking
embarrass you...

25:22.727 --> 25:24.524
or fucking have you hovering over me...

25:24.607 --> 25:27.644
like the ugliest fucking nurse
in the fucking universe.

25:33.287 --> 25:35.960
-lnto where?
-lnto where what?

25:36.127 --> 25:39.437
lnto where are you fucking moving
when you fucking move out of here?

25:39.527 --> 25:41.995
lnto the fucking whorehouse
down the way...

25:42.087 --> 25:44.396
which you fucking sent me
to see that woman at.

25:44.487 --> 25:47.923
lf needing to piss in my ear didn't
crowd out every other fucking thought...

25:48.007 --> 25:50.202
or recollection in your head!

25:52.927 --> 25:54.997
How did the two of you get along?

25:56.247 --> 25:58.761
Did l just fucking say
l was moving in there?

25:58.847 --> 26:01.315
Which being it's a fucking whorehouse
could indicate...

26:01.407 --> 26:04.683
some fucking business arrangement
or some other fucking thing.

26:04.767 --> 26:07.042
Yeah, l'm gonna be queen hooker.

26:07.127 --> 26:10.437
You're a keen fucking student
of the human scene, Charlie!

26:13.727 --> 26:14.842
Well, good.

26:16.927 --> 26:18.042
Good.

26:22.047 --> 26:23.878
Where are you going, anyway?

26:27.807 --> 26:30.037
l've made a decision not to tell you.

26:30.487 --> 26:34.446
lf you made a decision not to tell me,
what did you just fucking tell me for?

26:34.527 --> 26:38.805
My decision is not to tell you
my specific destination.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.441
'Cause...

26:43.247 --> 26:44.885
l don't think l should.

26:45.447 --> 26:47.039
And that's that.

26:47.447 --> 26:50.883
Well, have a safe journey
to your unannounced destination...

26:50.967 --> 26:53.003
and a safe fucking return.

26:53.767 --> 26:57.203
And good luck to you
with your new living arrangement.

27:00.087 --> 27:03.204
And my best, please, to Miss Stubbs.

27:04.487 --> 27:07.445
And you not only
a fucking pain in the balls, Charlie...

27:07.527 --> 27:11.122
but also the strangest fucking person
l ever met.

27:11.967 --> 27:13.798
You'll get no argument here.

27:14.327 --> 27:15.442
Good!

27:22.607 --> 27:24.996
Three plus three would equal six.

27:27.487 --> 27:30.479
Well, l sometimes put nine
to amuse myself.

27:31.527 --> 27:33.085
All right, take it up.

27:33.247 --> 27:35.715
Vigilant to detail like his pa.

27:39.167 --> 27:41.806
l'd think Mrs Garret,
as the bank's chief backer...

27:41.887 --> 27:44.321
might wish to be present for its opening.

27:47.367 --> 27:51.485
-Well, as far as that, l got her proxy.
-Yes, but wouldn't she wish to be?

27:55.407 --> 27:57.079
Perhaps she would.

27:58.807 --> 28:00.126
l can ask.

28:03.807 --> 28:04.842
Excuse me.

28:11.087 --> 28:12.998
What the fuck's going on?

28:13.087 --> 28:14.566
You ask the wrong fella.

28:14.647 --> 28:17.605
The water comes to a boil
between them two fucking women...

28:17.687 --> 28:19.837
l will fucking guarantee you that much.

28:19.927 --> 28:23.397
Have you proposed to Mrs Garret
as you fucking swore you would?

28:23.847 --> 28:28.523
Leaving aside what l did swear
or didn't, let's say l fucking have.

28:28.607 --> 28:29.642
And?

28:29.727 --> 28:32.878
That's where the matter stands.
She ain't said yes or no.

28:33.167 --> 28:36.239
How did the lady incline,
fucking Ellsworth?

28:36.327 --> 28:39.080
l wouldn't guess, fucking Trixie.

28:39.167 --> 28:41.237
Did you present yourself enthusiastic?

28:41.327 --> 28:43.761
Well, l didn't dance a jig
if that's what you're asking.

28:43.847 --> 28:47.157
Or more fucking glum like,
next to inviting refusal.

28:47.247 --> 28:48.566
Not glum.

28:50.007 --> 28:52.077
Not inviting refusal.

28:53.007 --> 28:55.202
Straightforward, l'd call it.

28:56.127 --> 28:57.606
-Sincere?
-Yeah.

29:01.087 --> 29:04.204
Well, what the fuck
is her fucking problem then?

29:04.927 --> 29:06.997
You're a worthy enough
fucking candidate...

29:07.087 --> 29:09.317
given all her fucking givens.

29:09.607 --> 29:11.245
Warm endorsement.

29:12.047 --> 29:14.800
She'd have to state her reservations.

29:15.567 --> 29:17.797
Mrs Garret writ me a letter...

29:18.327 --> 29:21.160
saying how yesterday she lost
her temper with you somewhat...

29:21.247 --> 29:25.923
and judgement, she tipped she was
on to you being a Pinkerton.

29:28.727 --> 29:32.356
Being bright, l expect you concluded
it was me must have told her.

29:32.447 --> 29:34.722
Meaning maybe l sold over to her.

29:34.807 --> 29:36.365
And with my allegiance
now in question...

29:36.447 --> 29:39.359
l expect you wired
the Pinkerton big shots...

29:39.447 --> 29:41.199
arguing you oughtn't sign
any documents...

29:41.287 --> 29:43.323
that might be able to prove that you,
the agency...

29:43.407 --> 29:46.126
and Mrs Garret's fucking in-laws
hired me...

29:46.207 --> 29:49.438
to lay at Mrs Garret's doorstep
the murder of her husband.

29:49.687 --> 29:53.157
And further, Mr Swearengen,
that as to purchase of your allegiance...

29:53.247 --> 29:56.398
now in question they might wish
to keep the bidding open.

29:57.047 --> 30:00.119
Bidding's open always on everyone,
Miss lsringhausen.

30:02.207 --> 30:04.767
But l expect you understand,
knowing as l do...

30:04.847 --> 30:09.477
should Mrs Garret lose her claim,
rather than operate it themselves...

30:09.567 --> 30:13.037
her cunt in-laws will sell
to third party cocksuckers inimical...

30:14.087 --> 30:16.885
to the whole of my interests
in this camp!

30:17.407 --> 30:20.001
To buy my allegiance against myself...

30:20.087 --> 30:21.600
in-law cunts...

30:22.007 --> 30:25.158
and shitheel operators
would have to bid very high indeed.

30:26.847 --> 30:29.805
No, more likely, Miss lsringhausen,
l think you'd contemplate...

30:29.887 --> 30:32.447
changing your allegiance
before l would mine.

30:34.567 --> 30:37.320
What benefit would l consider
might accrue to me?

30:37.407 --> 30:41.480
l intercepted your
shitheel boss' message back to you...

30:41.567 --> 30:45.355
through the miracle of telegraph,
and it answers that very question.

30:45.447 --> 30:48.678
As l have it here before me,
l will read it to you verbatim.

30:48.767 --> 30:51.361
''Miss lsringhausen, as this will
save you great pain...

30:51.447 --> 30:52.926
''and keep you from being killed...

30:53.007 --> 30:55.680
''sign all documents
Mr Swearengen has drawn.

30:55.767 --> 30:58.201
''Take the $5,000 and disappear.

30:59.247 --> 31:03.604
''Yours sincerely, your boss,
Pinkerton shitheels.''

31:07.207 --> 31:10.643
The $5,000 alluded to
in the invisible telegram...

31:10.727 --> 31:12.524
can the money be produced?

31:17.927 --> 31:20.999
Without, of course, exposing him
to the contents of the document...

31:21.087 --> 31:23.965
l would want the Sheriff present
at my signature...

31:24.207 --> 31:26.163
and as my escort from the camp.

31:27.927 --> 31:29.997
l bet that can be arranged.

31:32.847 --> 31:35.645
l can't betray
the confidence of messages.

31:39.087 --> 31:41.726
Don't guarantee
what you'll never do, Blasanov.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.764
Not without imagining
your feet stuck to the fire.

31:47.247 --> 31:48.396
Sir...

31:49.767 --> 31:53.760
l am a person
whose parents have been murdered...

31:53.847 --> 31:57.203
and no other family connection
and feeling...

31:57.287 --> 32:01.758
and believe in confidence of messages.

32:02.367 --> 32:04.835
What the fuck's
all that supposed to mean?

32:05.407 --> 32:06.681
l hope...

32:06.887 --> 32:08.605
feet in the fire...

32:09.767 --> 32:11.485
would not change me.

32:11.887 --> 32:14.845
-Congratulations, Mr Nuttall.
-Thank you, young man.

32:14.927 --> 32:16.997
-How's the boneshaker?
-Un-shook.

32:17.087 --> 32:19.317
Which would be a fib to say about me.

32:22.527 --> 32:23.846
l've come, Sheriff...

32:23.927 --> 32:27.886
to ask what you've learnt
of the shooting yesterday in my place.

32:28.487 --> 32:31.559
Mose Manuel said his brother
killed himself by accident.

32:31.647 --> 32:33.046
By accident?

32:33.527 --> 32:35.995
Two hours before Mose
sells their claim...

32:36.087 --> 32:38.043
that Charlie said
they'd worked theirselves...

32:38.127 --> 32:40.800
lock, stock, and barrel
to the Hearst interests?

32:40.887 --> 32:42.923
There's no witnesses, Tom.

32:44.167 --> 32:48.080
Hurtful, brother against brother
in a joint that bears my name.

32:49.247 --> 32:51.477
The most recent hurtful event.

32:53.687 --> 32:56.884
But might l ask William to assist me...

32:56.967 --> 32:59.879
in calibrating
the boneshaker's handlebars?

33:02.527 --> 33:03.926
Go ahead, William.

33:05.687 --> 33:07.996
l don't know
how to calibrate handlebars, sir.

33:08.087 --> 33:10.078
Oh, knowledge is overrated, William.

33:10.167 --> 33:14.558
Diligence is what's required
in the service of a willing spirit.

33:16.087 --> 33:19.124
Easy! Easy, boy.
l use my right hand to pour.

33:24.087 --> 33:27.159
And then Mrs Bullock said...

33:27.247 --> 33:30.762
as it's yours, you might want to see
the safe installed.

33:31.567 --> 33:33.717
-Did she?
-Yes, ma'am.

33:33.807 --> 33:37.846
Having brought the midday meal as
the safe arrived with the money inside.

33:41.007 --> 33:43.840
And what did Mr Bullock say
to Mrs Bullock?

33:43.967 --> 33:46.197
He said that might be a good idea.

33:48.167 --> 33:51.716
With enthusiasm equalling yours
as you describe the moment?

33:52.367 --> 33:55.165
l'd say on Mr Bullock's part...

33:55.247 --> 33:58.159
about equal enthusiasm,
Mrs Garret, yes.

33:59.087 --> 34:02.159
-Despite which Mrs Bullock persisted?
-Yes.

34:06.887 --> 34:09.719
Well, perhaps l oughtn't to
disappoint her.

34:14.967 --> 34:17.879
Earlier when l asked
what else we might have to discuss...

34:17.967 --> 34:20.003
l referred to my proposal.

34:20.647 --> 34:22.717
l took that to be your meaning
at the time.

34:22.806 --> 34:24.081
Chose not to respond.

34:24.167 --> 34:27.125
Not to, yes, as l hadn't yet
made up my mind.

34:28.327 --> 34:30.556
-Have you now?
-Nor have l now.

34:36.286 --> 34:40.246
Would you have me decide now,
before l act on Mrs Bullock's invitation?

34:41.847 --> 34:43.724
Do you put me to those terms?

34:44.246 --> 34:47.239
l guess there's no burning rush.

34:51.527 --> 34:53.757
Shall we go for a walk, Sofia?

35:19.447 --> 35:21.881
Are you certain you won't join us?

35:24.367 --> 35:25.402
Thank you.

35:26.087 --> 35:28.476
l tend to forego the midday meal.

35:41.727 --> 35:43.479
lt occurred to me...

35:44.167 --> 35:47.159
Mrs Garret having reason to be present
in any case...

35:47.447 --> 35:50.200
that we might discuss
in more formed a fashion...

35:50.287 --> 35:52.596
our plans for the children's schooling.

35:53.367 --> 35:56.803
More constructively
than in some previous conversation.

36:03.047 --> 36:04.241
l'm delighted.

36:04.967 --> 36:06.036
Wonderful.

36:10.367 --> 36:12.483
Mr Swearengen asked to see you,
Sheriff.

36:12.567 --> 36:14.000
Not just now.

36:22.927 --> 36:27.318
A man tying the right rope to the frame
and the other end to a thunderhead...

36:27.407 --> 36:29.841
could use the machine to tow clouds.

36:29.927 --> 36:31.440
l wish l was taller.

36:31.527 --> 36:33.040
Well, when your legs lengthen...

36:33.127 --> 36:36.756
l calculate you will be among
the great cloud haulers of the world.

36:36.847 --> 36:39.315
Just to ride like you did yesterday,
Mr Nuttall.

36:39.407 --> 36:40.760
You should have seen your face.

36:40.847 --> 36:43.919
The Bella Union gap was my crucible,
William.

36:44.007 --> 36:46.237
The fabled mud slick.

36:46.327 --> 36:49.797
l shifted shoulders forward,
but not too much...

36:49.887 --> 36:52.606
and at a sledgetrench, ho!

36:52.687 --> 36:54.996
Swung my buttocks left, by God...

36:55.087 --> 36:58.841
turned the bars just so, thump!

36:58.927 --> 37:03.682
The buried plank, bom!
And did l not come through a treat?

37:07.807 --> 37:09.957
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

37:10.047 --> 37:13.005
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon, Mrs Garret.

37:14.367 --> 37:16.483
Good afternoon, Mrs Bullock.

37:16.567 --> 37:21.083
Very good wishes on a venture offering
opportunity to so many in the camp.

37:28.727 --> 37:30.365
-Thank you.
-Hope.

37:32.847 --> 37:35.884
For taking up the education
of the camp's children...

37:35.967 --> 37:38.117
my Sofia included, thank you.

37:38.967 --> 37:42.039
As l feel l expressed inadequately
when last we spoke.

37:42.887 --> 37:44.843
Bite of meat, Mrs Garret?

37:44.927 --> 37:46.485
No, thank you.

37:49.527 --> 37:51.677
That appears to be the safe.

37:52.007 --> 37:52.996
William...

37:53.087 --> 37:55.999
do we dare ride double?

37:56.087 --> 37:58.442
-l do if you do.
-l do!

37:59.007 --> 38:00.360
Dauntless then!

38:00.447 --> 38:04.122
Courage high to the sticking place
and honour bright...

38:04.207 --> 38:08.519
as l mount and circle and consider
the best way to swoop you up.

38:09.687 --> 38:11.598
Awaiting you here, sir.

38:16.047 --> 38:17.196
Great.

38:18.207 --> 38:19.401
Beautiful.

38:28.847 --> 38:30.917
This all seems very much in order.

38:40.167 --> 38:41.759
First depositor.

38:57.887 --> 39:01.038
lt's to witness
some wrist business, Sheriff.

39:01.127 --> 39:03.925
Al said brief but of crucial importance.

39:07.887 --> 39:10.321
-How long will we be?
-Brief, very.

39:10.847 --> 39:12.838
And you'd save me a beating.

39:17.247 --> 39:18.157
Excuse me.

39:22.487 --> 39:24.239
Get your head on it.

39:24.967 --> 39:28.642
-My head is on it.
-Get your head on it, Tess!

39:28.727 --> 39:30.638
lt's on it, Mr Tolliver.

39:30.727 --> 39:33.366
lt does sound like a girl
with a mouthful, Mr Manuel.

39:33.447 --> 39:34.482
Jesus Christ!

39:34.567 --> 39:37.877
Her tongue in her cheek can achieve
the same fucking effect.

39:38.367 --> 39:41.040
l require a conversation with the sheriff.

39:41.127 --> 39:42.606
Confess a crime.

39:45.127 --> 39:46.879
You're fucking cheating me!

39:48.167 --> 39:50.681
-Get the fuck out from under there!
-l ain't cheating you, sir.

39:50.767 --> 39:52.598
Will you have
another dealer, Mr Manuel?

39:52.687 --> 39:53.915
Another fucking cheat?

39:54.007 --> 39:57.238
Hot and cold's the way the cards run,
sir, time immemorial.

39:59.927 --> 40:01.440
l want it back.

40:01.967 --> 40:03.685
Give it back to me!

40:05.487 --> 40:09.878
Give him his last wager, Leon.
We'll call that one no bet.

40:10.487 --> 40:12.125
Yes, sir, Mr Tolliver.

40:13.887 --> 40:16.003
All of it. Everything.

40:16.087 --> 40:19.443
Now, l can't do that, Mr Manuel,
as l believe you know.

40:19.527 --> 40:21.643
And those rifles are aimed at your head.

40:21.727 --> 40:23.080
Everything!

40:23.527 --> 40:26.917
lncluding youth, Mr Manuel?
And why not beauty?

40:27.007 --> 40:30.761
Not credibly restored, perhaps,
but as a new non-negotiable term?

40:30.847 --> 40:33.520
Would you not have, too,
your brother Charlie resurrected?

40:33.607 --> 40:35.996
Would you stipulate
your envy of him be purged?

40:36.087 --> 40:39.204
Surely, you'll insist
that Charlie retained certain defects.

40:39.287 --> 40:42.006
His ineffable self-deceptions...

40:42.087 --> 40:44.647
for example,
which were your joy in life to rebuke...

40:44.727 --> 40:46.797
and purpose, so far as you had one.

40:46.887 --> 40:51.039
l suppose you would see removed those
qualities which caused you to love him.

40:51.167 --> 40:54.842
And the obliviousness to danger
which allowed you to shed his blood.

41:04.207 --> 41:06.243
l want to talk to Bullock!

41:07.447 --> 41:09.199
Get the fucking Doc!

41:10.887 --> 41:13.037
l could have cooled that out.

41:13.127 --> 41:15.721
On my order, Mr Tolliver,
Lee will burn this building...

41:15.807 --> 41:18.446
mutilating you before,
during or after as l specify...

41:18.527 --> 41:20.438
or when he chooses unless l forbid.

41:20.527 --> 41:23.325
Oh, my full attention is at your disposal.

41:23.407 --> 41:27.400
Tell Sheriff Bullock what transpired here
before getting the Doc.

41:36.767 --> 41:38.962
-And now how many?
-Eight.

41:42.247 --> 41:43.839
Two portions of four.

41:44.327 --> 41:45.965
Very good, Sofia.

41:46.207 --> 41:47.845
May l have candy?

41:49.167 --> 41:52.284
You ask a reward, Sofia,
for doing your numbers?

41:52.967 --> 41:55.356
Where would you get such an idea?

41:59.127 --> 42:01.721
''Received from Trixie....''

42:03.327 --> 42:04.646
The whore.

42:07.487 --> 42:09.364
May l sign the first receipt?

42:10.207 --> 42:11.720
Yes, please do.

42:22.687 --> 42:25.155
-Huzzah.
-l'm to fetch Sheriff Bullock.

42:25.247 --> 42:26.965
He'll be back momentarily.

42:29.207 --> 42:31.482
-All right, let's go.
-Ready, ready?

42:31.567 --> 42:33.637
-Ready. Here we go.
-Up! Up!

42:35.567 --> 42:36.886
We missed.

42:37.367 --> 42:40.598
Trial run. No harm done at all.
Hey, swing around, Tom!

42:40.727 --> 42:41.955
On my way!

42:42.047 --> 42:43.446
Tie off that leg rope.

42:43.527 --> 42:46.439
Don't you want to serve your country
as good as they been to you?

42:46.527 --> 42:48.245
l bet you don't even vote.

42:48.367 --> 42:49.800
Hold that leg rope!

42:53.087 --> 42:55.521
Whoa, hey, whoa!

43:19.967 --> 43:22.640
That's between us.
Tell no one l give you that.

43:22.727 --> 43:24.922
l'd best not, but thank you.

43:25.007 --> 43:27.999
You keep it a secret,
and you won't get into any trouble.

43:28.087 --> 43:32.239
And if you told l helped you on the bike,
that's between you and your father.

43:41.247 --> 43:42.362
Hey!

44:24.687 --> 44:26.643
l think my back's broke.
