WEBVTT

00:03.366 --> 00:05.982
Well, you never
can predict the hitch.

00:06.010 --> 00:07.859
Bypasses go like a dream,

00:07.947 --> 00:10.453
and now this valve just
doesn't want to be found.

00:10.540 --> 00:11.986
The search continues.

00:12.074 --> 00:13.377
When I was a kid,

00:13.465 --> 00:15.119
my dog Arthur got lost.

00:15.221 --> 00:16.914
I searched for him for days.

00:17.001 --> 00:20.041
And I hoped and I prayed...

00:20.129 --> 00:21.872
- Did you find him, Doctor?
- No.

00:22.004 --> 00:25.025
But he was imaginary, so I have
to take some responsibility.

00:25.260 --> 00:27.234
Hope is what you make of it.

00:27.322 --> 00:28.877
- Am I right?
- Mm-hmm.

00:30.549 --> 00:32.932
Dr. Pierce, the admiral's family
has been updated.

00:33.020 --> 00:34.322
Nurse Tolliver,

00:34.410 --> 00:35.933
right on cue,

00:36.021 --> 00:37.986
with the steadiest hands
in the land.

00:38.074 --> 00:42.049
I'm attempting to hunt down
a very shy mitral here.

00:42.137 --> 00:44.963
Please tell me I didn't miss
the story about Arthur.

00:45.938 --> 00:47.641
Look at that.

00:47.791 --> 00:48.964
There it is,

00:49.301 --> 00:51.084
our missing mitral valve.

00:51.171 --> 00:53.104
And it appears to be reparable.

00:53.192 --> 00:55.416
Admiral, today
is your lucky day.

00:59.517 --> 01:00.780
Are those gunshots?

01:00.961 --> 01:02.799
That's right below us.

01:02.895 --> 01:04.224
Code silver.

01:04.313 --> 01:07.166
Active shooter, ground level,
Entrance A.

01:07.291 --> 01:08.814
This is not a drill.

01:09.127 --> 01:10.627
Evacuate to a secure location.

01:10.715 --> 01:11.979
- But, Doctor...
- Go.

01:12.067 --> 01:13.174
- <i>Code silver.</i>
- Now.

01:13.262 --> 01:15.977
<i>Active shooter,
ground level, Entrance A.</i>

01:16.065 --> 01:17.414
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

01:17.502 --> 01:18.820
Okay, you need to go, too.

01:18.908 --> 01:20.764
You can't do this on your own.

01:20.851 --> 01:22.650
If he starts to bleed,
you'll lose him.

01:22.738 --> 01:24.666
- Faith...
- Dr. Pierce.

01:26.275 --> 01:27.294
I'm staying.

01:27.381 --> 01:28.424
All right.

01:28.511 --> 01:29.604
Hold steady.

01:29.924 --> 01:31.474
Accessing the valve.

01:31.643 --> 01:32.951
Hopes and prayers.

02:10.395 --> 02:12.020
Morning, friends.

02:12.108 --> 02:14.169
- Morning.
- Hey, you need help with that?

02:14.257 --> 02:16.020
- Nope, I got it.
- You don't always have

02:16.107 --> 02:17.112
to be a hero, you know?

02:17.200 --> 02:18.384
People are not gonna
think less of you

02:18.471 --> 02:19.591
if I hold the dumpster
open while you

02:19.679 --> 02:21.020
throw that in the trash.

02:21.108 --> 02:22.228
I'm not getting rid of it.

02:22.316 --> 02:23.536
No, why should you?

02:23.624 --> 02:26.372
That shabby/chic vibe
is very hot right now.

02:28.192 --> 02:29.450
Says Delilah.

02:29.538 --> 02:31.403
Actually, I read that plants go

02:31.491 --> 02:34.612
into dormancy for long periods
of time, and I was hoping

02:34.700 --> 02:36.893
that Kasie might know
how to wake it up.

02:36.981 --> 02:39.185
Beep, beep.
Coming through.

02:39.273 --> 02:40.731
Renny down
in purchasing

02:40.819 --> 02:43.786
got all of this paper
on a fantastic sale.

02:43.891 --> 02:45.634
Yeah, maybe because it's green.

02:45.721 --> 02:47.934
Yeah. Yeah, she didn't
realize that when she bought it.

02:48.021 --> 02:50.645
She also didn't realize
it was nonreturnable.

02:50.733 --> 02:53.294
I found her inconsolable
in the copy room.

02:53.381 --> 02:54.994
But I reassured her

02:55.081 --> 02:56.810
that I would save her job

02:56.898 --> 02:59.653
by distributing this
as scratch paper.

02:59.741 --> 03:01.341
Talk about heroes.
Look at this guy.

03:01.429 --> 03:03.563
They can't fire her
for accidentally ordering

03:03.651 --> 03:04.802
the wrong color paper.

03:04.890 --> 03:07.544
You guys,
let's not risk it, okay?

03:07.880 --> 03:09.825
If the director asks, just say

03:09.913 --> 03:11.656
green scratch paper
really helps you,

03:11.828 --> 03:13.903
I don't know, solve more crimes.

03:14.105 --> 03:15.075
You want me to take that

03:15.163 --> 03:16.986
- to the dumpster for you?
- No, I do not.

03:17.074 --> 03:18.557
She thinks it's sleeping.

03:18.645 --> 03:19.895
Oh.

03:19.983 --> 03:21.763
Yeah, yeah.

03:21.931 --> 03:24.886
No. No, there's not a lick
of green in there, Bishop.

03:24.974 --> 03:26.454
I'm sorry,
but this is way dead.

03:26.541 --> 03:28.677
Okay, I wouldn't call that
an official test.

03:28.765 --> 03:30.442
Hey, the guy knows dead, Bishop.

03:30.530 --> 03:31.567
Since when do you care so much

03:31.655 --> 03:33.169
- about plants anyway?
- Gear up.

03:33.301 --> 03:35.384
- Let's go, right now.
- What's going on, Boss?

03:35.472 --> 03:37.565
Active shooter, Liberty Naval.

03:37.653 --> 03:39.083
Wait, at the hospital?

03:40.388 --> 03:41.692
Oh, my God.

03:41.784 --> 03:43.493
<i>This is an active shooter...</i>

03:43.581 --> 03:45.214
Go, go, go, go!

03:45.956 --> 03:47.487
<i>Move it!</i>

03:48.163 --> 03:49.860
<i>Failure to comply</i>

03:49.948 --> 03:52.136
<i>is a criminal offense.</i>

03:57.933 --> 03:59.628
Folks, we appreciate
your patience.

03:59.716 --> 04:01.815
I know you want to get home to
your families, but it's crucial

04:01.903 --> 04:03.886
we get all of your statements
as soon as possible.

04:03.974 --> 04:05.784
Gibbs, this is Captain Crawford,

04:05.872 --> 04:07.690
- commanding officer at the hospital.
- Captain, what do we got?

04:07.810 --> 04:09.751
Shooter fled
the immediate scene on foot.

04:09.839 --> 04:11.618
Where he went from there
is unknown.

04:11.706 --> 04:13.440
MPD was first on the scene.

04:13.528 --> 04:15.901
They've already blocked off
a one-mile radius

04:16.055 --> 04:17.430
with checkpoints. SWAT did a sweep.

04:17.519 --> 04:18.594
Building is cleared.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.970
Only people still inside
are essential staff

04:21.058 --> 04:22.409
and those patients
that couldn't be moved.

04:22.497 --> 04:24.511
Wounded are being
transferred to Washington General.

04:24.599 --> 04:25.599
What about the shooter?

04:25.731 --> 04:27.565
Caucasian male wearing
Marine utilities

04:27.653 --> 04:29.253
and carrying a black duffel bag.

04:29.341 --> 04:30.909
No name tag on his uniform.

04:31.041 --> 04:33.157
He grabbed an AR-15
from his bag

04:33.245 --> 04:34.727
and started shooting
the lobby randomly.

04:34.815 --> 04:37.284
He was wearing an
eight-point hat pulled down low.

04:37.372 --> 04:39.079
Uh, our witnesses
can't seem to agree

04:39.167 --> 04:40.386
on a description
of his face.

04:40.474 --> 04:42.742
But there is still a good amount
of people yet to be interviewed.

04:42.830 --> 04:44.663
Talk to everybody
who was inside.

04:44.751 --> 04:46.597
I want all accounts
logged through us.

04:46.685 --> 04:47.898
On it.

04:47.986 --> 04:49.581
Captain. Anything I can do
to help you find

04:49.669 --> 04:52.206
the son of a bitch
who did this, you say the word.

04:54.917 --> 04:56.064
Excuse me.

04:56.151 --> 04:57.526
Do you have a list of victims?
I need one.

04:57.622 --> 04:59.634
- Jack.
- Oh, Gibbs. There you are.

04:59.722 --> 05:00.872
Do you have the list of, uh...

05:00.960 --> 05:02.610
One dead, 12 wounded.

05:04.336 --> 05:05.689
Are you sure?

05:05.777 --> 05:07.786
One of the wounded
is an off-duty cop.

05:08.002 --> 05:10.411
Witnesses said he returned fire.

05:10.499 --> 05:11.778
That's him.

05:12.099 --> 05:14.362
Shot the shooter
once in the shoulder.

05:14.887 --> 05:15.905
He sent him running.

05:15.993 --> 05:17.996
Are you sure
this list is complete?

05:18.151 --> 05:20.286
Unless someone
tells me otherwise.

05:21.551 --> 05:23.809
Look, MPD is
stretched thin.

05:23.905 --> 05:26.258
Gonna jump in and help me with
some of these witness statements?

05:26.531 --> 05:28.444
Jack.
Did you hear me?

05:28.715 --> 05:30.129
All hands are on deck.

05:30.393 --> 05:31.419
No.

05:31.507 --> 05:32.699
What?

05:32.787 --> 05:34.785
I'm sorry, Gibbs,
I can't help you.

05:34.947 --> 05:37.690
I'm recusing myself
from this investigation.

05:38.121 --> 05:39.644
Want to tell me why?

05:40.371 --> 05:41.537
Jack!

05:54.491 --> 05:55.934
McGee, give me a sitrep.

05:56.137 --> 05:57.705
Well, no activity
at our checkpoints.

05:57.793 --> 05:59.303
BOLO's out wide on our shooter,

05:59.391 --> 06:01.465
but we still have no viable
description of his face.

06:01.553 --> 06:02.946
We have a hospital
full of witnesses,

06:03.034 --> 06:04.337
and you're telling me
we got nothing?

06:04.425 --> 06:05.558
Well, I wouldn't say "nothing."

06:05.646 --> 06:07.779
- What?
- An attack like this happens

06:07.890 --> 06:10.160
in a first-floor lobby,
common sense says

06:10.248 --> 06:12.642
the shooter came through the
front entrance, but he didn't.

06:12.730 --> 06:13.754
He came off an elevator.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.379
- He was on another floor?
- Yep.

06:15.467 --> 06:16.879
We just don't know which one
or why.

06:16.967 --> 06:18.100
All right. Security footage?

06:18.188 --> 06:20.086
- On my way to get it now.
- Yeah.

06:21.174 --> 06:22.781
Gibbs. Hey.

06:23.093 --> 06:24.241
Want to take a look at this?

06:24.329 --> 06:25.462
I got the shooter's blood

06:25.550 --> 06:27.210
on the road
and on the barricade.

06:27.298 --> 06:29.773
He bypassed the
security gate on foot.

06:31.724 --> 06:34.030
He left a trail of blood
along the way.

06:34.546 --> 06:35.520
Where does the trail end?

06:35.616 --> 06:36.648
Down the street.

06:36.736 --> 06:38.439
It looks like he got into a car
and drove off.

06:38.527 --> 06:41.130
Great. Means he's already
outside the checkpoints.

06:41.499 --> 06:42.952
Come on, damn it.

06:43.040 --> 06:44.163
There a problem?

06:46.484 --> 06:49.468
I need to take a swab, and
I can't find my gloves.

06:51.858 --> 06:52.999
Thanks.

06:53.147 --> 06:55.616
You know, man, uh,
other kinds of crimes,

06:55.704 --> 06:57.085
I've learned to process.

06:57.339 --> 07:01.226
But when a guy shoots random,
innocent people, it just...

07:02.588 --> 07:04.501
...it makes my inner swan
come out.

07:05.407 --> 07:06.437
What?

07:06.525 --> 07:09.655
Okay, so swans, they-they look
like they're really nice,

07:09.743 --> 07:11.110
but you push their buttons,

07:11.198 --> 07:13.591
you know, those birds
can go dark real quick.

07:13.679 --> 07:17.868
Mass shootings just, uh,
make me want to go swan.

07:18.118 --> 07:21.649
Our priority is the shooter.
All right? Let's get this guy.

07:21.737 --> 07:23.243
- Yeah. - All right.

07:23.331 --> 07:24.914
Hey, Gibbs.

07:25.774 --> 07:28.469
Can you please not make me
talk to Sloane again?

07:30.130 --> 07:32.313
I'm past my quota for the month.

07:32.586 --> 07:33.618
Agent Gibbs.

07:33.719 --> 07:35.735
I have the civilian
employee list you requested.

07:35.823 --> 07:36.993
Yeah, thanks.

07:38.774 --> 07:41.540
Something in particular
you're looking for?

07:49.060 --> 07:51.563
Chief Petty Officer
Diana Sanchez.

07:52.360 --> 07:53.721
There you are.

07:55.641 --> 07:56.993
Nice to meet you.

08:00.700 --> 08:02.876
List of victims is confirmed.

08:02.964 --> 08:05.437
12 wounded, nine of them
still critical.

08:05.697 --> 08:07.454
So far, she's our only fatality.

08:07.542 --> 08:09.938
She took two shots to
the chest, one to the leg.

08:10.026 --> 08:11.589
Kasie has the slugs now.

08:11.677 --> 08:13.590
I was just looking up
more about her

08:13.678 --> 08:18.251
so she wouldn't be just another
body on the table, you know?

08:18.489 --> 08:20.012
She was from Austin.

08:20.177 --> 08:23.001
She oversaw
hospital admissions.

08:23.089 --> 08:26.446
Mother of two boys,
five and three.

08:27.368 --> 08:30.494
Her favorite movie
was The Wizard of Oz.

08:31.054 --> 08:32.767
I spoke to her husband.

08:33.047 --> 08:34.960
Feels like you wanted to
get to know her, too, huh?

08:35.111 --> 08:38.414
Awful as this is, we could be
looking at dozens of bodies.

08:38.503 --> 08:41.030
That off-duty cop, he was...
he was thinking on his feet,

08:41.118 --> 08:42.259
firing back like that.

08:42.347 --> 08:44.507
I'm assuming he was hit, too,
he's one of the criticals?

08:44.595 --> 08:45.684
- Officer...
- Moseby.

08:45.771 --> 08:47.518
- Moseby.
- Yeah, he's still in surgery.

08:47.744 --> 08:51.393
Hopefully, we, uh... we won't
have to be back here again.

08:56.854 --> 08:58.111
Kasie.

08:58.199 --> 09:00.022
I have
the shooter's blood. Oh, great.

09:00.171 --> 09:02.502
Mass Spec is rebooting.
I'll get started in a minute.

09:02.605 --> 09:04.688
By the way, the dumpster
out back is full.

09:04.791 --> 09:06.761
Hey, what? I'm not
throwing this away.

09:06.849 --> 09:08.112
I need your help waking it up.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.333
Yeah, okay.

09:09.533 --> 09:11.886
Okay, listen,
look at me.

09:12.421 --> 09:14.854
Mass shootings make me
want to go swan.

09:14.942 --> 09:17.605
I was gonna punch something, but
then I walked by Bishop's desk

09:17.693 --> 09:19.646
and I saw this thing,
so I'm gonna do this

09:19.734 --> 09:22.251
instead of punching. That was a lot
of information,

09:22.376 --> 09:25.032
most of which I am not
entirely clear on.

09:25.126 --> 09:27.413
But I am getting that
you want to repurpose

09:27.501 --> 09:29.954
your negative energy
in a positive way?

09:30.042 --> 09:32.954
Yeah, that, so...
what do we do?

09:33.042 --> 09:34.133
Do we, uh,

09:34.390 --> 09:35.743
throw some water
on it?

09:35.831 --> 09:38.095
- Nick, this thing is dead.
- Damn it.

09:38.183 --> 09:40.298
But I will... I will
call my botanist friend

09:40.386 --> 09:42.134
and ask for a second
opinion, okay, Nick?

09:42.617 --> 09:43.612
Okay, buddy?

09:43.915 --> 09:45.383
Oh, got something.

09:46.063 --> 09:48.725
We've been combing through
hospital security footage.

09:48.813 --> 09:51.259
The stuff of the actual
shooting was awful to watch.

09:51.370 --> 09:52.475
Couldn't get a good angle

09:52.563 --> 09:54.297
- of the shooter's face.
- But you were able

09:54.385 --> 09:56.128
- to figure out where he was beforehand?
- Yeah.

09:56.216 --> 09:58.569
Before he took the elevator
down to the ground floor

09:58.657 --> 10:01.545
and started shooting,
he was on the third floor.

10:02.639 --> 10:04.515
That's got to be him.

10:05.428 --> 10:07.585
Marine utilities, black bag.

10:07.673 --> 10:09.303
That nurse is talking to him.

10:09.511 --> 10:11.332
Seems like she might've gotten
a good look at his face.

10:11.420 --> 10:12.522
Who is she?

10:12.610 --> 10:15.220
I'll see how close I can
zoom in without distortion.

10:16.285 --> 10:18.920
We get a good look
at her badge here.

10:20.327 --> 10:23.264
Operating room RN,
Faith Tolliver.

10:23.366 --> 10:25.170
All right, Faith Tolliver.

10:25.414 --> 10:27.067
Checking the log.

10:27.155 --> 10:29.413
Why didn't she say something
when we interviewed her?

10:30.274 --> 10:31.628
She hasn't been interviewed yet.

10:31.716 --> 10:33.719
- Why not?'
- Cause she didn't evacuate.

10:33.829 --> 10:35.350
She probably doesn't
even know yet

10:35.438 --> 10:36.961
that she saw
the shooter's face.

10:37.049 --> 10:39.538
Says here that she stayed
inside the hospital

10:39.626 --> 10:41.499
to assist in
an open-heart surgery.

10:44.519 --> 10:46.089
Brave woman.

10:53.358 --> 10:57.098
Civilian O.R. nurse,
Faith Tolliver.

11:01.301 --> 11:02.864
What do you want me to say?

11:02.951 --> 11:04.553
Back at the hospital,
Jack, I asked you

11:04.641 --> 11:05.904
a question, and
you walked away.

11:05.992 --> 11:07.645
I did not think
you were the type.

11:07.733 --> 11:11.962
Hey, listen, Gibbs,
I am not some underling

11:12.050 --> 11:14.053
that you can manipulate
with a look, if you forgot.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.805
- No, you can't put this on me.
- Why not?

11:16.893 --> 11:19.943
World-class investigator
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

11:20.031 --> 11:22.250
That's some fancy research
you did behind my back.

11:22.338 --> 11:23.484
I had enough to go on.

11:23.572 --> 11:25.413
Yeah, well, next time
we have a drink,

11:25.501 --> 11:27.312
remind me
to keep my mouth shut,

11:27.400 --> 11:29.219
or better yet,
remind me to stay home!

11:29.307 --> 11:30.797
Hey! I should
be out there

11:30.898 --> 11:32.959
investigating,
not wasting my time

11:33.047 --> 11:34.523
on something
that you can tell me.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.508
Yes, okay? Yes.

11:36.612 --> 11:39.000
She is my biological daughter.

11:39.459 --> 11:40.802
Okay?

11:40.890 --> 11:42.853
- Can we get on with our lives now?
- No, we can't,

11:42.941 --> 11:45.424
because your daughter
is the only witness we have

11:45.512 --> 11:47.433
who may have seen
our shooter's face,

11:47.521 --> 11:49.171
and she's on the way in.

11:50.462 --> 11:51.765
What?

11:51.875 --> 11:53.004
Now.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.011
No.

11:57.375 --> 11:59.638
Gibbs, I haven't been
in the same room with her

11:59.726 --> 12:01.297
since the day she was born.

12:01.385 --> 12:03.703
Jack, my priority

12:03.890 --> 12:05.406
is the shooter.

12:05.820 --> 12:09.366
Apart from that,
I'm on your side.

12:10.842 --> 12:13.272
She doesn't know me.

12:14.066 --> 12:18.194
Gibbs, Faith doesn't know
who I am.

12:20.256 --> 12:22.424
And I want to keep it that way.

12:34.202 --> 12:36.725
Yes, Madam Secretary,
we will turn over every rock

12:36.813 --> 12:39.109
on the Eastern seaboard
until we find this guy.

12:39.266 --> 12:40.399
Yep.

12:40.487 --> 12:42.022
That and then some.

12:42.110 --> 12:43.553
Uh, copy that, ma'am.

12:43.641 --> 12:45.641
Yes, I-I'll keep you apprised.

12:47.720 --> 12:50.616
Shooter's blood was not
in the DoD's database.

12:51.086 --> 12:52.655
- Not a Marine.
- I heard.

12:52.765 --> 12:54.403
Any theories as to why
a civilian

12:54.491 --> 12:57.061
would dress up like a Marine
and shoot up a Navy hospital?

12:57.149 --> 12:58.232
Do you want me
to stand here guessing

12:58.320 --> 12:59.421
or go out and find the guy?

12:59.509 --> 13:01.163
I'll see you later.

13:01.897 --> 13:02.997
Gibbs.

13:03.085 --> 13:04.594
You've spoken
to Agent Sloane?

13:04.681 --> 13:07.604
She recused herself
from this investigation.

13:07.714 --> 13:09.013
You know why?

13:09.724 --> 13:10.729
Do you?

13:10.865 --> 13:12.404
I don't feel
comfortable

13:12.492 --> 13:14.334
talking about her personal...

13:16.251 --> 13:17.796
Makes two of us.

13:17.884 --> 13:20.393
Okay, hi. Hello.
I'm standing right out here,

13:20.481 --> 13:21.953
and this conversation
is excruciating.

13:22.041 --> 13:23.304
You both know everything, so...

13:23.392 --> 13:25.320
- get over it.
- All right, good talk, Gibbs.

13:25.617 --> 13:27.492
Faith is waiting for you
in the conference room.

13:27.580 --> 13:29.013
Okay? W-Wait.

13:29.227 --> 13:31.930
Just make sure
you let her talk.

13:32.151 --> 13:34.640
She's likely traumatized, so you
need to be sensitive to that,

13:34.728 --> 13:37.291
and-and look out
for her nonverbal cues.

13:37.479 --> 13:38.906
Are you gonna take notes?

13:39.085 --> 13:41.114
- What?
- What?

13:41.905 --> 13:43.073
What?

13:43.161 --> 13:45.093
Agent Sloane, would you like
to be in that room?

13:45.190 --> 13:48.153
What? No. Oh...
Gibbs will do fine.

13:48.241 --> 13:50.492
Yeah, he will,
but what about you?

13:52.594 --> 13:56.047
Right. No, right, I can, uh...
I can handle that.

13:56.135 --> 13:57.601
I-I would just be
an extra set of

13:57.689 --> 14:00.219
eyes and ears, and she doesn't
even know who I am, so...

14:01.068 --> 14:02.328
Great.

14:05.598 --> 14:06.859
Wow.

14:12.061 --> 14:13.711
The hell is this for?

14:18.707 --> 14:19.840
Ms. Tolliver.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.466
I'm Special Agent Gibbs.

14:22.069 --> 14:23.594
Faith. Call me Faith.

14:23.694 --> 14:25.554
This is Special
Agent Sloane.

14:26.186 --> 14:27.375
Hi.

14:27.513 --> 14:28.596
How are you?

14:28.816 --> 14:30.508
Fine. Nice to meet you.

14:30.635 --> 14:32.458
Would it be okay
if we just get started?

14:32.546 --> 14:34.445
I'd like to get back to
work as soon as possible.

14:34.533 --> 14:35.906
Sure.
Yeah.

14:36.048 --> 14:37.672
We're listening,
whenever you're ready.

14:37.882 --> 14:40.008
Start whenever
you're comfortable.

14:40.830 --> 14:43.743
I didn't even know
that I had spoken to him.

14:43.838 --> 14:44.992
I mean...

14:45.185 --> 14:49.938
I didn't know that he was
the one who... um...

14:50.134 --> 14:53.148
Uh, Faith, take your time.
It's okay.

14:54.029 --> 14:57.952
Okay. I was updating a patient's
family on his surgery

14:58.109 --> 15:00.953
when I saw a man in uniform
walk out of the break room.

15:01.041 --> 15:03.195
- Any idea what he was doing there?
- No.

15:03.305 --> 15:06.283
I didn't recognize him,
but that's not unusual.

15:06.371 --> 15:07.187
Sometimes,

15:07.275 --> 15:09.429
family or friends
will visit staff

15:09.517 --> 15:11.404
in the break room for a lunch

15:11.507 --> 15:12.687
- or coffee.
- You talked to him?

15:12.775 --> 15:16.234
Yes, because he looked like
he might have been lost,

15:16.769 --> 15:19.992
so I asked him
if he needed any help.

15:20.102 --> 15:22.845
He said no, he got
in the elevator,

15:23.011 --> 15:24.734
I went back
to the O.R.,

15:24.917 --> 15:27.031
and then we heard the...

15:27.523 --> 15:29.109
the shots.

15:30.749 --> 15:32.047
Sorry.

15:33.999 --> 15:36.359
Chief Sanchez,
the woman who was...

15:36.774 --> 15:38.601
was killed, sh...

15:41.320 --> 15:43.633
...sh-she was a friend.

15:43.979 --> 15:45.239
Sorry.

15:48.690 --> 15:51.178
Um, Faith, do you think

15:51.266 --> 15:53.711
you could describe
this man for us?

15:54.047 --> 15:57.211
Uh, yes, he was...

15:57.299 --> 16:00.042
young, dark hair...

16:00.130 --> 16:02.043
I'd like you to sit
with our forensic scientist,

16:02.131 --> 16:03.664
come up with a composite.

16:04.375 --> 16:05.258
I don't know if I

16:05.346 --> 16:08.195
can remember him clearly enough
for that. I'm sorry.

16:08.283 --> 16:12.556
Oh, not to worry, you've done
a great deal already just

16:12.644 --> 16:13.907
by being here.
Thank you.

16:14.213 --> 16:16.256
I'd like you to try
the composite.

16:16.975 --> 16:18.093
Sometimes,
we remember

16:18.181 --> 16:19.351
more than we think.

16:19.439 --> 16:22.359
It is something you could do
for Chief Sanchez.

16:25.281 --> 16:26.320
You're right.

16:26.408 --> 16:29.408
Yes. Of course. I-I'll try.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.281
So that's our guy, huh?

16:36.369 --> 16:37.932
- Looks like a kid.
- Ooh!

16:38.020 --> 16:40.216
I'll tell you what,
doing a composite

16:40.304 --> 16:42.351
after a traumatic event
is no joke.

16:42.439 --> 16:43.892
Faith Tolliver
sat in here

16:43.980 --> 16:45.790
for two hours
on eye shapes alone.

16:45.878 --> 16:48.141
What are you doing with my plant?
Giving it back to Nick.

16:48.229 --> 16:50.157
Hey, what are you
doing with my plant?

16:50.245 --> 16:52.508
Repurposing negative energy.

16:53.134 --> 16:54.561
Oh, that's the thing
where mass shootings

16:54.649 --> 16:56.181
make you want to go swan?

16:57.447 --> 16:59.509
Kasie, wait, you said
you were gonna help me.

16:59.597 --> 17:01.120
This thing still looks
like a tumbleweed.

17:01.208 --> 17:03.962
Yeah, I video-chatted with
my friend, Bob the botanist.

17:04.050 --> 17:06.002
He said that thing's
been dead for years.

17:06.127 --> 17:08.089
No plant can survive
dormancy for that long.

17:08.205 --> 17:09.144
- Are you sure?- Are you sure?

17:09.231 --> 17:10.884
Yeah. Also, Bishop,

17:10.971 --> 17:13.579
what were you doing
with a dead plant in your house

17:13.666 --> 17:15.023
for years?

17:15.307 --> 17:17.634
Did we walk over here 'cause
there was a ding or not?

17:17.721 --> 17:18.784
Oh, yes.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.825
Faith Tolliver said
she saw the shooter

17:20.926 --> 17:22.710
coming out of the break room
on the third floor.

17:22.798 --> 17:24.891
- What was he doing there?
- That is the question.

17:24.979 --> 17:26.672
There's no security cameras
in the break room,

17:26.767 --> 17:29.042
but I asked the agent
assigned to the hospital

17:29.130 --> 17:32.026
to send over some photos.
Hence the ding.

17:32.356 --> 17:35.823
And we have several
views here...

17:36.260 --> 17:37.353
Hold on.

17:37.441 --> 17:38.534
Wait.

17:38.859 --> 17:40.516
What's that on the floor?

17:41.260 --> 17:42.433
Looks like an outline.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.500
Yeah, like something big
was sitting there

17:44.588 --> 17:46.111
and left some
kind of mark.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.352
What was it?

17:47.440 --> 17:49.093
An industrial-size cooler.

17:49.181 --> 17:51.070
I just confirmed
with Captain Crawford.

17:51.159 --> 17:53.843
Two months ago, the hospital
did some rearranging

17:53.931 --> 17:54.914
as part
of a renovation.

17:55.002 --> 17:57.453
Hmm. Break room
used to be something else.

17:57.541 --> 17:59.500
Yeah, a med room,
and the cooler that was there

17:59.601 --> 18:01.133
was used to store medications.

18:01.221 --> 18:02.914
Possible the shooter didn't
know about the renovation.

18:03.002 --> 18:04.422
Which also means
it's possible he was

18:04.510 --> 18:06.023
in the break room
looking for drugs.

18:06.111 --> 18:09.024
Look alive, Team Gibbs. We got
a hit from Kasie's composite.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.178
We gearing up?
Like a clock, baby.

18:11.266 --> 18:12.812
Multiple members
of the public called in.

18:12.900 --> 18:15.083
I.D.'ing him as
18-year-old Evan Sykes.

18:15.171 --> 18:17.672
Lives with his father
in Laurel, Maryland.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.734
NCIS.

18:37.952 --> 18:40.969
Boss, looks like he dug
the bullet out of his shoulder.

18:41.057 --> 18:43.000
Patched himself
up best he could.

18:44.054 --> 18:46.017
Place is clear.
Looks like he bolted.

18:46.190 --> 18:47.363
Evan!

18:47.520 --> 18:51.043
I called you ten times.

18:51.201 --> 18:52.681
Oh, my God.

18:54.741 --> 18:55.744
Evan!

18:55.832 --> 18:57.524
- NCIS.
- Freeze. Where is he?

18:57.612 --> 18:58.745
- Where's my son?
- Hold on.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.016
Get off of me!

19:00.633 --> 19:01.797
Evan!

19:01.885 --> 19:03.848
Get off me! Evan!

19:04.007 --> 19:07.750
Hey, the cuffs stay on
until you settle down.

19:07.860 --> 19:09.123
What happened
to my son?

19:09.429 --> 19:10.508
Evan!

19:10.638 --> 19:11.820
Gibbs.

19:14.907 --> 19:16.663
He did something on his laptop
before he left.

19:16.751 --> 19:18.539
There's blood
on the keyboard.

19:20.731 --> 19:23.001
What are these papers?

19:33.445 --> 19:35.294
Bishop.

19:35.554 --> 19:37.540
He stood right here.

19:39.370 --> 19:41.181
More blood over there?

19:45.023 --> 19:46.326
Ammo box.

19:47.790 --> 19:49.470
Good for an AR-15.

19:52.051 --> 19:53.224
Empty.

19:54.211 --> 19:55.587
He's restocked.

19:55.752 --> 19:57.587
He's planning something else.

20:09.277 --> 20:11.689
I heard you guys are
using Renny's scrap paper

20:11.777 --> 20:14.751
to help crack the case.
What is going on?

20:14.839 --> 20:18.062
Oh, I see why you needed
the recycling bin.

20:18.244 --> 20:19.400
Oh, is that, uh...

20:19.488 --> 20:20.831
That is Evan Sykes.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.882
Blood analysis confirmed
he's our shooter.

20:22.979 --> 20:24.632
Ugh, laptop's a bust.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.697
Hard drive's wiped clean.
Nothing's recoverable.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.363
But before it was wiped,

20:28.518 --> 20:30.181
his computer was
infected with a virus

20:30.269 --> 20:32.306
that sends a file to
the printer queue.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.150
Like, a file from his computer?

20:34.238 --> 20:37.241
No, like, thousands
of pages of gibberish.

20:37.329 --> 20:39.632
Well, I guess, uh, even bad guys

20:39.720 --> 20:41.594
get computer viruses just
like the rest of us, huh?

20:41.682 --> 20:42.815
Yeah, Evan tried
to print something

20:42.903 --> 20:44.210
before he left his house.

20:44.298 --> 20:46.334
Once he realized
that it was in line

20:46.422 --> 20:48.491
behind all this craziness,
he canceled the print job.

20:48.579 --> 20:50.983
His document only got
about ten-percent spooled.

20:51.071 --> 20:52.871
When it finally does print,
hopefully it'll be

20:52.958 --> 20:55.091
enough to give us something.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.881
You really have to look
at every page?

20:56.968 --> 20:59.180
I mean, can't you just wait
until the printer stops?

21:00.118 --> 21:01.506
Will you people let me be?

21:01.594 --> 21:03.131
It feels right
to look at every page,

21:03.219 --> 21:04.670
so I'm-a look at every page.

21:04.758 --> 21:06.102
Yeah, r-right, yeah.
So, I...

21:06.190 --> 21:08.500
When I look at this green paper,
it makes me think of,

21:08.588 --> 21:11.410
uh, the knights
of the Middle Ages, you know?

21:11.498 --> 21:13.472
They used to put green
in their coats of arms

21:13.560 --> 21:16.261
to signify hope
and loyalty of love.

21:16.349 --> 21:18.568
Which actually reminds me
of an epic tale of hope.

21:18.670 --> 21:20.597
First, I've got Torres
going swan.

21:20.685 --> 21:22.389
Now I got you going Mallard.

21:23.468 --> 21:25.258
Hmm, thank you.

21:26.904 --> 21:29.554
Oh, it's processing
Evan's print job.

21:31.214 --> 21:33.621
Well, that ten percent
did not give us much.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.091
It's the top
of a spreadsheet.

21:35.178 --> 21:36.741
Look at the
column headings.

21:37.098 --> 21:39.350
Liberty, Ice
Station, Willow Den.

21:39.438 --> 21:40.896
Liberty must mean
the hospital.

21:40.984 --> 21:43.592
And isn't the Ice Station
a skating rink?

21:44.037 --> 21:45.490
This could be
a list of targets.

21:45.653 --> 21:47.800
This spreadsheet could be
where he saved his research.

21:47.888 --> 21:50.176
Okay, uh, then,
what's Willow Den?

21:52.531 --> 21:53.924
Oh, my God.

21:54.012 --> 21:55.631
It's an elementary school
near the hospital.

21:55.718 --> 21:57.158
We got to find this guy now.

22:00.003 --> 22:01.460
He's my son.

22:01.731 --> 22:03.833
He's not
what you think he is.

22:04.315 --> 22:05.934
Oh, yeah, we
got that part.

22:06.442 --> 22:07.641
You're talking
in circles.

22:07.728 --> 22:09.348
I didn't know
he was planning this.

22:09.442 --> 22:11.258
I didn't even know
he had a gun.

22:12.964 --> 22:14.518
Up until six years ago,

22:14.606 --> 22:16.568
- he was good.
- What happened six years ago?

22:17.918 --> 22:20.091
Evan's brother Christopher
went to prison.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.033
He's still there. For what?

22:22.462 --> 22:23.751
Drunk driving.

22:24.103 --> 22:26.661
Uh, a family of four was killed.

22:27.345 --> 22:29.191
When Christopher
went to prison,

22:29.278 --> 22:31.408
Evan just started to spiral.

22:32.448 --> 22:35.736
He just wasn't himself.
He was... so angry.

22:36.668 --> 22:38.595
Why'd he target Liberty Naval?

22:39.150 --> 22:40.591
His brother was a Marine.

22:40.790 --> 22:42.850
In his mind,
the military could have

22:42.938 --> 22:45.392
- pushed for a lighter sentence.
- So Evan was angry

22:45.480 --> 22:47.587
that his guilty brother
was put away, so he decided

22:47.675 --> 22:50.093
to gun down a whole lobby
full of innocent people?

22:50.181 --> 22:51.731
I really don't see
the logic in that.

22:51.818 --> 22:53.088
Evan have a history of drug use?

22:53.176 --> 22:55.250
He stayed away from all that
because of what happened

22:55.338 --> 22:57.245
- to his brother.
Oh, it didn't happen to him.

22:57.333 --> 22:58.910
He got wasted,
got behind the wheel

22:58.998 --> 23:00.611
and took out an entire family.

23:00.698 --> 23:02.307
- And then there's Evan...
- Hey, Nick.

23:02.395 --> 23:03.635
No.

23:05.267 --> 23:06.784
He's right.

23:07.456 --> 23:08.791
Tell me how to help you.

23:08.878 --> 23:10.549
Ice Station skating rink.

23:10.802 --> 23:13.526
Willow Den School.
What is he gonna hit next?

23:17.205 --> 23:18.890
I don't know why
he'd attack either.

23:18.978 --> 23:20.971
They got to have something
to do with his brother.

23:21.059 --> 23:22.940
And I'm telling you
that they don't.

23:23.143 --> 23:24.678
Enough.

23:26.510 --> 23:28.479
Well, where would Evan go?

23:29.471 --> 23:31.638
Where is he hiding out?

23:32.882 --> 23:34.842
Hey, look at me.

23:37.237 --> 23:38.596
Where is he?

23:39.198 --> 23:40.741
I don't know.

23:40.892 --> 23:42.560
When you find him...

23:43.049 --> 23:44.478
please don't hurt him.

23:46.857 --> 23:48.427
I'm begging you.

23:49.756 --> 23:50.940
Please.

23:51.067 --> 23:52.290
It's hard to watch.

23:52.400 --> 23:54.963
From what he's saying,
Evan Sykes is unhinged.

23:55.138 --> 23:57.907
Willow Den School is closed
for a staff retreat.

23:57.995 --> 24:00.672
Skating rink ignored our advice
to shut down, so we bolstered

24:00.760 --> 24:02.258
- their security.
-  What about Faith?

24:02.346 --> 24:03.461
She saw his face.

24:03.549 --> 24:05.191
Hospital
full of witnesses, Jack.

24:05.278 --> 24:06.625
Unlikely Faith
would be targeted.

24:06.713 --> 24:08.344
- Leon...
-  The agent assigned

24:08.432 --> 24:10.362
to the hospital
will look out for her there.

24:10.510 --> 24:11.831
Gibbs offered to post someone

24:11.919 --> 24:13.956
outside her residence,
but she declined.

24:14.416 --> 24:16.565
Said she wanted
to put this all behind her.

24:16.955 --> 24:18.799
Faith is a pretty strong
young lady.

24:19.502 --> 24:21.588
Interesting,
her location, though.

24:22.213 --> 24:23.081
What do you mean?

24:23.237 --> 24:25.526
That the two of you
ended up in the same city.

24:27.907 --> 24:29.385
Jack, you okay?

24:30.244 --> 24:31.346
Hey.

24:31.434 --> 24:33.297
Officer Moseby pulled
through his surgery.

24:33.385 --> 24:34.493
I'm gonna head over
and talk to him.

24:34.581 --> 24:36.260
Gibbs will want to join you.

24:36.603 --> 24:38.625
This interrogation
is pretty much over.

24:38.713 --> 24:39.968
Wouldn't you say?

24:49.321 --> 24:50.579
Doctor.

24:50.814 --> 24:53.252
- Doctor, hold up, please.
- NCIS.

24:53.424 --> 24:54.666
We're looking to see.

24:54.754 --> 24:56.479
Officer Moseby
as soon as possible.

24:56.612 --> 24:57.995
I need to check
his vitals first.

24:58.096 --> 24:59.682
It shouldn't take long.

25:00.502 --> 25:03.121
I am never gonna
look at hospitals

25:03.208 --> 25:04.893
the same way again.

25:06.291 --> 25:08.010
Hey. Um...

25:08.377 --> 25:10.870
I don't know if you heard about
me bringing in this plant.

25:11.502 --> 25:13.181
Had a few other things
going on, Bishop.

25:13.268 --> 25:14.611
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I know.

25:14.698 --> 25:16.831
It's just, the plant,
it's from...

25:16.918 --> 25:18.854
Ziva's office.

25:21.252 --> 25:22.659
You said you were clearing out.

25:22.807 --> 25:24.081
I am. I just...
I thought you might

25:24.169 --> 25:27.463
have an opinion about...
me trying to save it.

25:27.604 --> 25:28.631
A plant?

25:28.718 --> 25:29.940
Yeah.

25:30.198 --> 25:32.784
You see this?
You get personally involved,

25:32.956 --> 25:34.151
you can't move on.

25:34.238 --> 25:35.461
Gibbs...

25:35.752 --> 25:38.487
if you know,
I need you to say it.

25:40.948 --> 25:42.510
I know what?

25:47.534 --> 25:48.651
Nothing.

25:49.198 --> 25:50.776
He's ready for you now.

25:56.166 --> 25:57.690
Took one in the stomach.

25:58.823 --> 26:00.831
Ripped apart my intestines.

26:01.237 --> 26:04.011
The other one missed my
heart by a half an inch.

26:04.221 --> 26:07.010
I won't be running a
marathon anytime soon.

26:08.829 --> 26:10.393
But, you know...

26:10.557 --> 26:11.761
I'm lucky.

26:11.885 --> 26:14.323
Everyone in the hospital
was lucky you were there.

26:14.526 --> 26:17.526
I know I hit him once, but...

26:17.814 --> 26:20.500
I didn't really
even see his face.

26:20.807 --> 26:23.548
I didn't see where he
came from, nothing.

26:25.291 --> 26:26.682
Excuse me.

26:27.031 --> 26:29.031
Special Agent Bishop.

26:30.822 --> 26:32.354
Listen.

26:33.078 --> 26:36.018
The doctor says I'm supposed
to be sleeping, but...

26:36.438 --> 26:37.874
I can't.

26:37.962 --> 26:39.395
You think we're
gonna get this guy?

26:39.483 --> 26:41.926
Yeah, we I.D.'d him.
18-year-old kid.

26:42.704 --> 26:43.948
Evan Sykes.

26:44.806 --> 26:46.362
Eighteen.

26:46.450 --> 26:47.776
Hey.

26:47.972 --> 26:49.416
We're gonna get him.

26:51.482 --> 26:53.395
The minute I woke up...

26:53.940 --> 26:56.291
I had to laugh,
you know what I mean?

26:57.893 --> 26:59.516
It's like some
bad joke.

26:59.604 --> 27:01.875
I'm out there putting my
ass on the line every day,

27:01.963 --> 27:03.461
and then
this happens when I'm

27:03.548 --> 27:06.182
bringing my wife
pancakes on my day off.

27:08.167 --> 27:09.342
But damn...

27:10.096 --> 27:12.510
you got to laugh,
because otherwise...

27:12.963 --> 27:14.081
Your wife a patient?

27:14.168 --> 27:15.596
No, she works
at the hospital.

27:15.791 --> 27:17.828
Yeah? What floor? The third.

27:19.870 --> 27:21.073
Gibbs.

27:24.393 --> 27:25.969
Security at
the skating rink

27:26.057 --> 27:27.328
spotted a man
in Marine utilities.

27:27.416 --> 27:28.571
He's loitering
in the parking lot

27:28.659 --> 27:29.838
carrying a black bag.

27:34.456 --> 27:36.229
Hey, back in the car,
back in the car.

27:40.668 --> 27:42.068
We got him.

27:44.979 --> 27:46.909
NCIS! Drop the bag!

27:47.872 --> 27:50.792
Okay, okay, okay.
Don't shoot.

27:51.859 --> 27:53.199
I didn't do anything.

27:53.995 --> 27:55.258
Lose the cover.

27:56.057 --> 27:58.019
Damn it, let me see your eyes.

27:59.784 --> 28:01.261
It's not him.

28:01.348 --> 28:03.391
He's not even
a Marine.

28:03.478 --> 28:04.651
Bag is clear. I was just waiting

28:04.738 --> 28:05.911
for my buddy to
get out of hockey

28:05.998 --> 28:07.511
so we could go
to the gym.

28:08.504 --> 28:09.804
Get out of here.

28:12.012 --> 28:13.402
Go on.

28:14.708 --> 28:16.051
He keeps dressing like a Marine,

28:16.138 --> 28:18.003
Evan Sykes could be anyone
in this town.

28:19.026 --> 28:21.167
Father have any idea
where he might be?

28:21.255 --> 28:22.319
None.

28:22.407 --> 28:23.410
So we've got nothing.

28:23.498 --> 28:24.631
I got something.

28:25.490 --> 28:26.933
Pancakes.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.131
What are you doing here? Faith,

28:44.218 --> 28:46.189
listen, I know that
you declined protection,

28:46.277 --> 28:48.275
but after learning more
about the shooter,

28:48.363 --> 28:49.481
I strongly advise you

28:49.568 --> 28:50.961
to err on the
side of caution.

28:51.048 --> 28:52.698
Unbelievable.

28:54.228 --> 28:56.097
Uh, I'm sorry.

28:57.276 --> 29:00.181
I'm just giving you
my honest professional opinion.

29:00.269 --> 29:01.931
Oh, oh, really, is that
what you're doing?

29:02.018 --> 29:03.634
How do you think I felt
when I saw you

29:03.722 --> 29:05.136
walk in that room today?

29:05.255 --> 29:07.175
What?
What are you...

29:07.605 --> 29:09.417
You think I don't
know who you are?

29:10.104 --> 29:11.367
I know.

29:11.588 --> 29:14.368
Okay?
I've known for years.

29:14.456 --> 29:16.548
You're not that hard
to find online.

29:18.402 --> 29:21.771
You know, you're the one that
said you didn't want to know.

29:22.073 --> 29:25.341
But I guess you looked
me up, too, didn't you?

29:25.428 --> 29:27.529
Yes, I did. Why?

29:28.342 --> 29:30.582
The day I was born,
you handed me to my mom,

29:30.670 --> 29:32.418
and you told her that
you never wanted

29:32.506 --> 29:34.521
to have anything to
do with me again.

29:34.608 --> 29:36.001
It wasn't as simple as that.

29:36.089 --> 29:37.715
Oh, no, no, right.
I forgot the part

29:37.803 --> 29:39.051
where you went on with your life

29:39.138 --> 29:41.201
and made something great
of yourself.

29:41.748 --> 29:44.191
You know what?
You made your choice.

29:44.959 --> 29:48.090
You don't get to show up
at my door now

29:48.178 --> 29:49.920
and pretend that you care.

29:53.053 --> 29:54.981
You don't get
to change your mind.

29:55.068 --> 29:56.639
- Faith, please don't do this.
- No.

29:56.727 --> 29:58.545
This is the one
thing you taught me:

29:58.732 --> 30:00.826
how to walk away
without looking back.

30:15.974 --> 30:19.152
Gibbs. Rumor has it that
we're pumping all our resources

30:19.240 --> 30:21.499
into a hunch of yours
regarding pancakes?

30:21.587 --> 30:22.654
Well, when Gibbs' gut

30:22.742 --> 30:24.889
gets to churnin', the
perps will be burnin'.

30:27.045 --> 30:28.717
Sorry, I usually just
say that in my head.

30:28.805 --> 30:29.756
The morning
of the shooting,

30:29.844 --> 30:32.107
Officer Moseby was
at the hospital

30:32.202 --> 30:33.912
bringing pancakes
to his wife.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.537
She works
on the third floor.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.615
They ate together in
the same break room

30:37.703 --> 30:38.959
that Evan Sykes
was seen exiting.

30:39.047 --> 30:40.482
Officer Moseby also plays

30:40.570 --> 30:42.123
on a rec hockey team
at the Ice Station,

30:42.211 --> 30:45.482
and he drops his kids off
at Willow Den three days a week.

30:45.581 --> 30:47.884
Evan Sykes wasn't looking
for drugs in that break room.

30:47.972 --> 30:49.670
He was looking for Moseby.

30:50.357 --> 30:53.646
This was a targeted hit
disguised as a mass shooting.

30:54.779 --> 30:57.107
What better way to hide
your motive than to make

30:57.195 --> 30:58.662
the target appear
to be random.

30:58.750 --> 31:00.092
All right. Thanks.

31:00.528 --> 31:01.951
Officer Moseby is safe.

31:02.039 --> 31:03.943
We have three agents
outside his hospital room.

31:04.031 --> 31:05.607
- Do we have a motive?
- Working on it.

31:05.695 --> 31:08.201
I did some digging into
Evan's brother Christopher.

31:08.366 --> 31:11.402
It turns out he's up for
parole next month, and guess

31:11.490 --> 31:15.162
who always does a victims impact
statement at his hearings.

31:15.497 --> 31:16.529
Moseby.

31:16.617 --> 31:17.685
Why would he do that?

31:17.773 --> 31:19.879
Because he was
the first responder

31:19.967 --> 31:21.982
at Christopher's drunk
driving accident.

31:22.070 --> 31:24.014
Moseby speaks for
the family that died

31:24.116 --> 31:25.584
because they're not here
to speak for themselves.

31:25.672 --> 31:28.191
And by killing that voice,
Evan thought his brother

31:28.279 --> 31:30.105
might stand a better chance
of being released.

31:30.193 --> 31:31.259
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Wait,

31:31.346 --> 31:33.959
if Moseby knew
all of this, wouldn't he think

31:34.046 --> 31:35.904
something was up
when he heard the name Sykes?

31:35.992 --> 31:38.631
No, because Christopher goes by
a different last name, Thompson.

31:38.753 --> 31:41.843
But last names aside,
Evan Sykes is still out there.

31:46.943 --> 31:48.059
Boss?

31:48.146 --> 31:49.332
Directive hasn't changed.

31:49.420 --> 31:51.276
Get me a location
on Evan Sykes.

31:53.881 --> 31:55.076
- Jack.
- Gibbs,

31:55.164 --> 31:56.337
good timing.

31:56.589 --> 31:57.935
Want you to take a look
at some stuff.

31:58.043 --> 31:59.592
Faith Tolliver just called.

32:00.766 --> 32:01.990
She changed her mind about

32:02.078 --> 32:03.691
having an agent
outside her place.

32:04.232 --> 32:06.092
She did?
That-that's great.

32:06.180 --> 32:09.404
She requested that this time,
it not be you.

32:10.162 --> 32:11.623
Uh-huh.

32:12.207 --> 32:13.390
I'm starting to think you had

32:13.478 --> 32:15.041
the right idea,
recusing yourself.

32:15.243 --> 32:19.073
Oh, I'm not recusing myself,
Gibbs. I can't.

32:20.416 --> 32:21.986
I'm in this.

32:24.467 --> 32:26.412
Here.
Take a look at this.

32:28.209 --> 32:30.850
Okay. Evan Sykes.

32:31.146 --> 32:33.725
He is a scared, lost kid.

32:33.813 --> 32:36.092
He likely has no idea
what to do next.

32:36.536 --> 32:38.029
Read this at your leisure,

32:38.117 --> 32:41.764
because this is the profile
that's really gonna help you.

32:41.912 --> 32:43.045
Noah Sykes.

32:43.133 --> 32:45.988
He worked three jobs to
get his son the best lawyer

32:46.076 --> 32:47.592
he could for that
drunk driving trial.

32:47.680 --> 32:49.333
And after one son
went to prison,

32:49.444 --> 32:51.439
Noah did everything
in his power

32:51.527 --> 32:53.520
to help the other one
move on.

32:53.637 --> 32:55.951
Evan was taunted
in school,

32:56.045 --> 32:58.569
so he moved him
to the next town over.

32:58.657 --> 33:00.592
He even changed
their last name.

33:02.850 --> 33:04.545
What does that mean, Jack?

33:04.703 --> 33:08.520
It means he's
the kind of parent

33:08.608 --> 33:11.951
that loves and protects
to the end, no matter what.

33:13.803 --> 33:15.272
He knows where Evan is.

33:15.576 --> 33:17.647
I would bet my life
on it.

33:18.146 --> 33:20.406
But you need to tell him
something, Gibbs.

33:21.489 --> 33:24.059
You need to tell him
that in this situation,

33:24.147 --> 33:27.069
there is only one way
to truly protect his son.

33:27.451 --> 33:29.045
Room 124.

33:40.724 --> 33:41.944
Room 124.

33:42.032 --> 33:43.264
He's alone.

33:43.694 --> 33:45.177
- I'll get the father out of here.
- Yeah.

33:45.265 --> 33:46.475
Wait.

33:48.661 --> 33:50.624
We can't let this kid off easy.

33:50.829 --> 33:53.272
Easy for him is dead.

34:02.459 --> 34:03.579
Yeah?

34:03.666 --> 34:05.928
Good? Go.

34:12.458 --> 34:13.809
All right, on your go, boss.

34:13.896 --> 34:15.289
No. Torres goes in alone.

34:15.677 --> 34:16.770
Gibbs?

34:16.858 --> 34:18.333
You got this?

34:19.359 --> 34:21.085
- Yeah.
- Go.

34:31.216 --> 34:32.396
NCIS!

34:36.565 --> 34:37.839
All right, kid,

34:37.926 --> 34:39.261
I'll make you a deal.

34:39.485 --> 34:42.149
You reach, and I shoot.

34:42.235 --> 34:43.799
I just wanted my brother back.

34:43.886 --> 34:45.149
Yeah, well,

34:45.235 --> 34:47.128
Officer Moseby survived.

34:48.214 --> 34:50.149
But what about Diana Sanchez?

34:50.808 --> 34:51.884
Who?

34:52.065 --> 34:54.143
She is the woman
you killed, Evan.

34:55.206 --> 34:56.589
Hey, tell me
something.

34:56.676 --> 35:00.249
Was shooting all those people
just a cover-up for your motive?

35:00.336 --> 35:02.433
Or was it your cry for help?

35:02.521 --> 35:04.253
Or was it just a bonus?

35:05.291 --> 35:06.527
'Cause, see,

35:06.644 --> 35:09.050
what gets under my skin
is that there was no reason,

35:09.152 --> 35:10.746
but there was a reason.

35:10.966 --> 35:12.539
You had a reason,
didn't you?

35:13.300 --> 35:16.480
You didn't have the power
to save your brother...

35:17.786 --> 35:19.730
...so in the hospital,

35:20.972 --> 35:23.691
you took the power
over everything.

35:25.441 --> 35:27.626
But, man...

35:29.964 --> 35:32.106
...I don't accept that reason.

35:39.578 --> 35:41.152
Pick it up, Evan.

35:42.548 --> 35:44.863
- Pick up the gun!
- I'm sorry! Don't shoot!

35:44.951 --> 35:46.597
Don't shoot.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.333
Please don't shoot.

35:50.472 --> 35:51.779
I'm sorry.

35:51.866 --> 35:53.606
That's not enough.

35:55.910 --> 35:57.378
Gibbs!

36:00.384 --> 36:02.654
All right, get your
hands behind your back.

36:14.716 --> 36:16.331
I'm sorry.

36:27.297 --> 36:28.730
Faith.

36:29.238 --> 36:31.379
Look, I know
Evan Sykes is in custody.

36:31.466 --> 36:32.917
They-they already told me.

36:33.071 --> 36:34.644
Yeah.

36:35.028 --> 36:36.458
Please.

36:42.656 --> 36:45.746
Okay. What is it you want
to say, Agent Sloane?

36:46.747 --> 36:50.863
I need you to know,
the day you were born,

36:51.002 --> 36:54.550
I did give you to your mother

36:55.730 --> 36:57.814
and told her
that I had to cut all ties.

36:57.902 --> 37:00.279
But it wasn't because
I didn't love you.

37:00.879 --> 37:02.369
I, um...

37:02.621 --> 37:04.899
I just knew that,
if I saw you again,

37:05.090 --> 37:07.379
I wouldn't be able
to let you go.

37:07.862 --> 37:09.768
But I had to.
I had to let you go,

37:09.856 --> 37:11.856
because I was, uh...

37:15.776 --> 37:17.519
I'm sorry
I can't explain it right now,

37:17.606 --> 37:19.299
but I will, one day.

37:19.386 --> 37:21.144
There is no "one day."

37:22.139 --> 37:23.764
Not for us.

37:34.631 --> 37:36.694
If you didn't want to see me,

37:37.536 --> 37:39.171
why did you risk it?

37:39.716 --> 37:41.014
What?

37:41.147 --> 37:43.410
You were in
California.

37:43.756 --> 37:45.702
You knew that moving here meant

37:45.879 --> 37:48.638
you might walk into a room
one day

37:48.726 --> 37:50.530
and I would be sitting there.

37:52.421 --> 37:54.561
Why didn't you just stay
where you were?

37:55.514 --> 37:57.835
Because I failed.

38:00.467 --> 38:03.739
I tried every which way
to let you go, but I...

38:03.975 --> 38:05.996
can't, so...

38:54.786 --> 38:57.678
Boss, you knew how on edge.

38:57.766 --> 39:00.061
Torres was about
this mass shooting.

39:00.850 --> 39:02.539
But you sent him in there alone.

39:02.626 --> 39:05.708
Guess you knew that...
raw kind of anger

39:05.796 --> 39:08.288
would scare Evan into
giving himself up.

39:10.236 --> 39:12.975
You knew Torres wasn't gonna
pull that trigger, right?

39:13.717 --> 39:15.733
There are no absolutes, Tim.

39:16.511 --> 39:18.121
Boss, you okay?

39:19.163 --> 39:21.119
I got one with a swan.

39:21.206 --> 39:23.069
I got one with a kid.

39:23.296 --> 39:25.296
I got one with a plant.

39:25.741 --> 39:27.744
"One with a kid."
You talking about Jimmy?

39:28.405 --> 39:30.202
I wanted to shake 'em all.

39:30.996 --> 39:33.147
I wanted to say, "Rule 10."

39:34.062 --> 39:35.452
Yeah, but you didn't.

39:37.696 --> 39:39.210
I couldn't.

39:39.876 --> 39:41.600
I burned Rule 10.

39:45.945 --> 39:47.686
No going back.

39:49.056 --> 39:51.553
Worked out okay today, but...

39:52.241 --> 39:53.512
What, you burned

39:53.600 --> 39:55.891
"never get personally
involved on a case"?

39:56.196 --> 39:58.991
Hey, Tim, you've always had
your head on straight.

39:59.655 --> 40:01.022
You always have.

40:01.186 --> 40:02.428
Make sure to keep it that way.

40:02.516 --> 40:04.270
I don't understand.
You-you've never gotten rid

40:04.358 --> 40:05.289
of any of the rules.

40:05.376 --> 40:06.788
I didn't do it for me.

40:10.303 --> 40:12.030
I'm not sure if it's right.

40:13.907 --> 40:16.913
Wow, you've... lived
with that rule a long time.

40:17.046 --> 40:19.514
Yeah. And I don't know where
I'm gonna end up without it.

40:38.046 --> 40:40.106
Nice to see some life in here.

40:43.272 --> 40:45.199
I thought you were
clearing the place out.

40:45.694 --> 40:46.842
Changed my mind.

40:46.930 --> 40:48.818
Well, like I said,

40:48.906 --> 40:51.655
Ziva made one last payment
before her death, so...

40:51.876 --> 40:53.905
we're good through the end
of next year.

40:54.202 --> 40:55.259
But I do like
to know

40:55.346 --> 40:57.342
who I'll see coming and going.

40:58.967 --> 41:00.219
You'll be...

41:00.374 --> 41:02.553
working in here
from time to time?

41:02.685 --> 41:03.998
Maybe.

41:04.085 --> 41:05.303
I hope so.

41:05.486 --> 41:07.749
Funny thing about hope...

41:09.195 --> 41:12.335
once she gets into your blood,
she never leaves you.

41:13.387 --> 41:14.733
Does she?

41:17.858 --> 41:19.796
I'll be seeing you, then.
