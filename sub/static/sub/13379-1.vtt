00:01.068 --> 00:04.903
Right, left.

00:06.073 --> 00:07.773
- Sound off.
- One, two.

00:07.875 --> 00:10.842
- Sound off.
- Three, four.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.477
- Morning, sir.
- Colonel Carson.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.145
General.

00:47.247 --> 00:50.482
Have a good two-month leave.
We'll miss you around here.

00:50.584 --> 00:51.750
Appreciate that, sir.

00:51.852 --> 00:53.552
I haven't been home
that long in years.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.521
And who knows,
maybe the next time I see you,

00:55.623 --> 00:57.889
you'll be General Carson.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.291
Anything's possible, sir.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.794
- Have a safe trip.
- Thank you, sir.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.450
I'm gonna go put these
outside, wanna come?

01:24.552 --> 01:27.553
Yeah, hold on.

01:27.655 --> 01:28.854
Dad's coming.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.334
When do you think
he's gonna get here?

01:30.358 --> 01:31.824
We haven't seen him in so long.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.660
I hope he likes it.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.528
I can't wait.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.268
Put one up a little higher.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.937
- How's that?
- Great.

01:46.039 --> 01:47.039
- That's good.
- Yeah?

01:47.074 --> 01:48.707
Yeah.

01:50.378 --> 01:53.379
Okay.

01:55.549 --> 01:56.749
Perfect, okay.

01:56.851 --> 01:58.751
Okay.

01:58.853 --> 02:00.886
There we go!
How does it look?

02:00.988 --> 02:03.088
- It looks good.
- Aah! It looks so good.

02:03.190 --> 02:05.724
It's great.
Dad's gonna love it.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.559
You did such a good job.

02:10.663 --> 02:13.632
I hope he likes it.

02:15.603 --> 02:18.336
Okay, he just called.
He'll be here any minute.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.338
Let's go.

02:20.441 --> 02:21.607
Hey, I saw that.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.275
- Saw what?
- Don't eat the cupcake.

02:23.377 --> 02:24.377
Fine.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.279
Oh, not that cheesy watch thing.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.247
- It is not cheesy.
- Wait, what watch thing?

02:29.349 --> 02:31.683
When dad's gone, mom wears
a watch to count the minutes

02:31.786 --> 02:33.118
until they're together again.

02:33.220 --> 02:36.622
But when they're together, she takes
it off because time doesn't matter.

02:36.724 --> 02:37.724
That's right.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.425
There he is.
Oh, my gosh.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.894
Hi, honey!

02:41.995 --> 02:43.595
- Hey, dad.
- Hi, honey.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.363
Oh, my gosh.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.299
Honey.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.867
- I love you.
- I love you too.

02:48.969 --> 02:51.637
Missed you.
Feels so good.

02:51.739 --> 02:52.739
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hi!

02:52.807 --> 02:55.006
Look at you.

02:55.108 --> 02:56.975
I missed you.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.677
Hello, Colonel.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.946
How are you, young man?

03:01.048 --> 03:02.881
Oh, no!

03:02.983 --> 03:05.951
It's okay, babe.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.221
- It's all right.
- That's okay, I got it.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.290
It's all right.

03:12.992 --> 03:14.752
That's all right,
I'll just make another one.

03:14.794 --> 03:15.794
Okay.

03:18.098 --> 03:22.067
It's so great to be home.
I really missed this.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.768
The food or us?

03:23.870 --> 03:25.203
Would I be a jerk
if I said both?

03:25.305 --> 03:27.572
No.

03:27.674 --> 03:31.909
I noticed,
my car wasn't in the driveway.

03:32.011 --> 03:33.978
- Right.
- Any reason for that?

03:34.081 --> 03:35.913
- I didn't crash it.
- It's in the shop.

03:36.015 --> 03:38.283
But nobody got hurt,
and I'm paying for the damage.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.385
What happened?

03:39.486 --> 03:40.766
We were having a driving lesson.

03:40.820 --> 03:43.199
She was staring at her boyfriend
and crashed into the mailbox.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.622
Boyfriend?
What boyfriend?

03:44.724 --> 03:46.391
- You are such a narc.
- Poser!

03:46.493 --> 03:50.828
You guys, stop fighting.
Your dad just got home.

03:52.632 --> 03:57.235
- Hey, those look fantastic.
- Thanks.

03:57.337 --> 03:59.571
Did you tell him
about the new store?

03:59.672 --> 04:01.872
- You found a place?
- Yes, yesterday.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.941
I was gonna tell you about it
in person.

04:04.043 --> 04:06.244
But there's this bakery
across town that backed out

04:06.346 --> 04:08.023
of their lease and the place
was halfway done,

04:08.047 --> 04:09.847
- so it was perfect.
- That was fast.

04:09.949 --> 04:12.817
I can't believe
how this has taken off.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.159
I don't know how I'm gonna
manage two stores all at once.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.721
But at least I have Sheila,
and once it's up and running,

04:17.824 --> 04:18.824
it's gonna be...

04:19.959 --> 04:21.959
I don't wanna talk about this.

04:22.060 --> 04:23.294
You're here for a week.

04:23.396 --> 04:26.531
I don't wanna
talk about business.

04:28.535 --> 04:30.968
- Actually, we don't have a week.
- What?

04:31.070 --> 04:32.903
It's only a weekend pass?

04:33.006 --> 04:34.939
But you're up for a promotion.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.675
And I've decided
to take a furlough...

04:37.777 --> 04:40.445
Until the review board
announces its decision.

04:40.547 --> 04:42.147
I'm here for two months.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.715
What? Two months?
Oh, my gosh!

04:44.817 --> 04:48.686
I'm so happy.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.721
Maybe forever.

04:50.823 --> 04:52.223
Forever?

04:52.325 --> 04:56.127
If I make General, that could mean
another four-year stint overseas,

04:56.229 --> 04:58.630
another four years of being
a part-time husband

04:58.731 --> 05:01.533
and a part-time father.

05:01.635 --> 05:05.670
I've missed so much
of your lives already.

05:05.772 --> 05:07.972
Are you saying that
you're considering retirement?

05:08.274 --> 05:11.409
I'm saying we have
a decision to make.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.918
Yeah, hi, Thad.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.454
Yes.

05:23.556 --> 05:25.990
Yeah, I know we
have to sign the papers.

05:26.092 --> 05:28.993
Thad, I just woke up.
I'll call you later, okay?

05:30.096 --> 05:31.429
Sorry.

05:31.531 --> 05:34.965
Why is he calling so early?
Are you, like, his only client?

05:35.067 --> 05:36.934
No, he's just enthusiastic.

05:37.036 --> 05:39.771
He's the one who put
this whole deal together.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.973
I never liked that guy.
He had a weak handshake.

05:43.075 --> 05:45.443
Do you remember when
you did a one-handed push-up

05:45.545 --> 05:46.778
over our wedding cake?

05:46.880 --> 05:49.013
How could I forget
the glory days?

05:49.115 --> 05:53.250
You still owe me
a real wedding, you know.

05:53.352 --> 05:54.719
That was a real wedding, honey.

05:54.821 --> 05:57.087
I don't know.

05:57.189 --> 05:59.457
It was on a military base
with a chaplain.

05:59.559 --> 06:02.427
We've lasted 18 years.
He must've said something right.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.162
Aw.

06:06.766 --> 06:07.766
Driving lesson.

06:07.834 --> 06:10.868
Wake up.

06:13.673 --> 06:15.039
You're joking, right?

06:15.141 --> 06:17.174
It's the perfect time.
There's no cars on the road.

06:17.276 --> 06:18.409
Mom's teaching me.

06:18.511 --> 06:19.644
Your mother is busy.

06:19.746 --> 06:21.946
I, on the other hand,
have nothing but time.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.626
And who is this boy
you're going out with?

06:23.650 --> 06:25.082
We're not going out.

06:25.184 --> 06:26.451
But you're planning to?

06:26.553 --> 06:28.085
- I guess.
- When?

06:28.187 --> 06:29.854
Do we really
have to do this now?

06:29.956 --> 06:31.088
- Absolutely.
- Mom?

06:31.190 --> 06:33.658
Might as well get it over with.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.860
Next weekend.

06:35.962 --> 06:39.029
And to your next questions,
he has a 3.4 gpa,

06:39.131 --> 06:40.498
no tattoos, no piercings.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.934
- You left out age.
- 35.

06:43.035 --> 06:46.103
But he spent 10 years in prison,
so he looks a lot younger.

06:46.205 --> 06:47.605
He's 18.

06:47.707 --> 06:48.906
18?

06:49.008 --> 06:50.419
Yeah, I met his mom.
She's really nice.

06:50.443 --> 06:51.976
You're talking
to his mother now?

06:52.078 --> 06:54.645
Of course I am.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.319
Are we almost done?

07:02.421 --> 07:04.489
Hey, we just started.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.190
That looks like poison oak.

07:06.292 --> 07:09.360
No, don't worry about that.

07:15.368 --> 07:16.501
Here we go.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.281
Honey.
Honey, honey, honey, honey.

07:19.305 --> 07:20.404
Sorry.
Can you just move...

07:21.608 --> 07:22.974
- Honey.
- Sorry.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.120
Go ahead.
No, no, go ahead.

07:25.144 --> 07:29.013
This isn't working...

07:30.783 --> 07:32.683
- Standing by.
- Oh, boy.

07:32.785 --> 07:36.420
Still standing by.

07:38.892 --> 07:39.935
- Careful, careful, honey.
- Sorry, sorry.

07:39.959 --> 07:40.959
I got a blade in my hand.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.427
I just don't wanna be late.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.530
Okay, all right, love you.

07:45.632 --> 07:46.632
Love you.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.501
I left you a to-do list, okay?
Bye.

07:52.739 --> 07:55.806
- How are you?
- I'm good.

08:17.096 --> 08:20.397
Tell me that's not what
you're wearing to school.

08:20.499 --> 08:22.132
- Mom left already?
- Yup.

08:22.234 --> 08:26.203
Then I guess this isn't
what I'm wearing to school.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.678
Does she always dress like that?

08:33.780 --> 08:35.446
Yes.

08:35.548 --> 08:37.313
You must be starving
after that workout, huh?

08:37.416 --> 08:39.249
Get your head up.

08:39.351 --> 08:41.719
Actually,
I feel like throwing up.

08:41.821 --> 08:45.022
Here we go.
Look at that.

08:45.124 --> 08:46.124
Eat up.

08:52.932 --> 08:53.965
That was fast.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.100
Do I pass inspection?

08:56.202 --> 08:57.334
Yeah.
Have some breakfast.

08:57.436 --> 09:00.170
Thanks, but I only
eat fruit before noon.

09:03.676 --> 09:04.942
Coming Ollie?

09:05.044 --> 09:07.277
Yeah.

09:07.379 --> 09:08.379
Love you, dad.

09:08.414 --> 09:11.115
Have a good day, guys.

09:33.773 --> 09:36.373
Guess I'll be needing
reading glasses.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.835
Whoa!

10:37.937 --> 10:39.081
You breaking into this house?

10:39.105 --> 10:41.271
- I live here.
- Most people use the door.

10:41.373 --> 10:43.140
- I lost my key.
- What's your name?

10:43.242 --> 10:45.109
Ray.

10:45.211 --> 10:46.844
Ray McKewen.

10:46.946 --> 10:48.378
Why aren't you in school,
McKewen?

10:48.480 --> 10:50.915
I came home early.
I had a toothache.

10:51.017 --> 10:52.917
A toothache?
Show me some I.D.

10:55.121 --> 10:57.054
What are you doing to my son?
Let him go.

10:57.156 --> 10:58.533
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I... I'm a neighbor.

10:58.557 --> 10:59.757
I just thought...

10:59.859 --> 11:01.103
Get out of here
before I call the cops!

11:01.127 --> 11:03.828
Okay.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.097
Carry on.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.266
Are you okay?

11:09.368 --> 11:10.935
Yeah.
That was awesome.

11:11.037 --> 11:14.138
It was not awesome.

11:22.148 --> 11:24.214
Hi, can I get
a strawberry cupcake

11:24.317 --> 11:27.051
and a coffee to go, please?

11:27.153 --> 11:29.519
- I'll be right there.
- Great.

11:29.621 --> 11:31.555
- I need a latte.
- Yeah.

11:34.726 --> 11:36.460
Double frosting coming right up.

11:36.562 --> 11:37.572
- Thanks, Janet.
- The usual.

11:37.596 --> 11:38.596
Is Griff back yet?

11:38.664 --> 11:41.398
He actually came back
last night, yes.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.567
There he is right now.
Hi.

11:43.669 --> 11:45.869
Hey, welcome home.

11:45.972 --> 11:48.805
Good to see you.
Welcome back.

11:48.907 --> 11:50.907
Hey, thanks for your service.

11:53.145 --> 11:54.145
There you go.

11:54.246 --> 11:55.279
Hi, hon.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.847
Hi.

11:58.650 --> 12:00.317
Hey, welcome back.

12:00.419 --> 12:03.954
Well, thank you, Sheila.
You're looking great.

12:04.056 --> 12:07.524
I'm 15 pounds overweight
and wearing far too much pink.

12:07.626 --> 12:09.893
- You want to try that again?
- How's your parakeet?

12:09.996 --> 12:11.996
Cockatoo.
I had to get rid of him.

12:12.098 --> 12:13.397
We didn't get along.

12:13.499 --> 12:17.167
Well, then, it's great
seeing you, as always.

12:17.269 --> 12:19.069
You too.

12:19.171 --> 12:20.871
And before I forget,

12:20.973 --> 12:23.374
we were all so relieved
to find out

12:23.476 --> 12:25.976
that nasty rash of yours
had cleared up.

12:27.313 --> 12:30.680
Janet, I'm going
to go watch Ollie practice.

12:30.782 --> 12:32.149
- Okay.
- So, honey,

12:32.251 --> 12:34.485
what time do you want me to
come back and pick you up?

12:34.586 --> 12:35.964
Don't worry about that.
Thad will drop me off.

12:35.988 --> 12:38.122
We have a meeting later tonight.

12:38.224 --> 12:39.589
- Great.
- What can I get for you?

12:39.691 --> 12:40.931
Can I get one of those, please?

12:40.959 --> 12:42.393
Okay.

12:42.495 --> 12:43.860
All right, son.
Grab your mitt.

12:43.962 --> 12:46.397
Head on out to the field.
Who's my next batter?

12:46.499 --> 12:48.632
Come on, Ollie.
Ollie, you're up.

12:48.734 --> 12:49.933
- Let's go, son.
- Yeah.

12:50.036 --> 12:51.101
Hustle up.

12:53.672 --> 12:56.173
Let's go, Ollie!

12:56.275 --> 12:58.208
Come on, Ollie.
You can do it, buddy.

12:58.310 --> 13:00.411
Let's go, buddy, let's go!
Let's go, Ollie.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.946
Stand right in there.
Stand right in there.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.726
- Weight on your back...
- spread your legs wider.

13:04.750 --> 13:07.284
Sorry, coach.

13:07.386 --> 13:09.520
When he winds up,
cock your elbow.

13:09.621 --> 13:11.088
Be ready to swing.

13:11.190 --> 13:12.322
Nice try, Ollie.

13:12.425 --> 13:13.968
Ollie, don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid.

13:13.992 --> 13:16.560
Dad, please.

13:19.331 --> 13:20.897
All right.
Step closer to the plate.

13:20.999 --> 13:22.710
- Get aggressive, Ollie!
- Don't dip your shoulder.

13:22.734 --> 13:23.945
Step right through there, buddy!

13:23.969 --> 13:25.202
Here we go, Ollie.

13:25.304 --> 13:28.305
Come on.
You got it, Ol.

13:28.407 --> 13:30.507
Ollie, swing, bud!
That's a strike!

13:30.609 --> 13:32.120
Swing right through.
Get aggressive, buddy.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.688
- Okay, you swung a little late.
- Step... step straight forward.

13:33.712 --> 13:34.789
- Keep your eye on the ball.
- Ollie, step forward.

13:34.813 --> 13:36.058
You're gonna
have to decide quickly.

13:36.082 --> 13:39.015
Forward, straight.
Line them up like I showed you.

13:39.118 --> 13:40.518
Strong stance, buddy.
Strong stance.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.719
Sorry, coach.

13:42.821 --> 13:46.390
Coach, you do your thing.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.025
Come on, bud.

13:49.128 --> 13:53.029
Here we go, batter.
Let's go.

13:53.132 --> 13:55.299
Nice try, Ollie.

13:55.401 --> 13:57.234
You swing at it
when they're that high.

13:57.336 --> 14:00.170
All right, next batter.

14:11.149 --> 14:12.949
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

14:14.453 --> 14:17.321
- How are you?
- Good.

14:17.423 --> 14:20.457
Welcome back, sergeant.

14:20.559 --> 14:22.225
Thanks.
And it's Colonel.

14:22.328 --> 14:24.728
We signed the lease.
We open in 30 days.

14:24.830 --> 14:28.432
- Hey, congratulations.
- Thank you, thank you.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.600
Did she tell about
the big order we pulled in?

14:30.703 --> 14:32.803
Sweet 16
for the mayor's daughter.

14:32.904 --> 14:34.037
- I mean, killer PR.
- Yeah.

14:34.139 --> 14:35.271
But if we play this right,

14:35.374 --> 14:37.974
our Janet here is gonna be
the new Mrs. Fields.

14:38.076 --> 14:39.843
And you can be,
Mr. Fields.

14:39.945 --> 14:43.146
Or I guess you'd be
Colonel fields, right?

14:43.248 --> 14:44.914
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right.

14:45.016 --> 14:46.950
Okay. Well, I'll see you
tomorrow, Janet.

14:47.052 --> 14:47.951
Thanks, Thad.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.486
- Colonel.
- Thad.

14:52.090 --> 14:54.891
Thad.

15:11.977 --> 15:13.343
What... what's going on?

15:13.445 --> 15:15.379
I never noticed it before.
I can't believe it.

15:15.481 --> 15:18.982
This place is like a home
invasion waiting to happen.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.585
I'm gonna put in
a security system.

15:21.687 --> 15:23.487
You mean, like,
lights and stuff?

15:23.589 --> 15:26.956
Yeah, and some other things.

15:27.058 --> 15:29.125
Okay.

15:29.227 --> 15:30.727
Honey, I had another idea.

15:30.829 --> 15:32.829
Do you think the house
needs to get painted?

15:32.931 --> 15:35.031
No. I think its fine.

15:35.133 --> 15:37.033
Well, because the backyard
was looking...

15:37.135 --> 15:38.913
look, I know you're not used
to not having anything to do.

15:38.937 --> 15:41.471
I've got plenty to do.

15:41.573 --> 15:44.240
Why does that scare me?

15:44.342 --> 15:46.383
You know it takes some adjusting
when you're home on leave.

15:46.412 --> 15:48.144
What if this isn't just leave?

15:48.246 --> 15:53.283
Well, when you get the
promotion, we'll figure it out.

15:53.385 --> 15:55.251
And if I don't get it?

15:55.353 --> 15:57.954
You'll get used to it,
I promise.

15:59.892 --> 16:02.292
I love you so much.

16:02.394 --> 16:03.794
I love you too, hon.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.522
You may go.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.432
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:42.534 --> 16:43.567
How are you?

16:43.669 --> 16:44.712
I'm good.
Sorry I'm a little late.

16:44.736 --> 16:45.736
That's all right.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.171
- Ready?
- Yup.

17:29.108 --> 17:30.407
Okay.

17:39.985 --> 17:41.185
So what are you guys gonna do?

17:41.253 --> 17:43.086
- Watch TV.
- Okay.

17:43.188 --> 17:44.621
I don't have any homework, so...

17:45.724 --> 17:47.457
That's awesome.

17:47.559 --> 17:49.293
I can't see.

17:49.395 --> 17:52.062
Let's see.

17:52.164 --> 17:54.398
- That's cool.
- That's dad.

17:54.499 --> 17:56.133
What is...

17:56.235 --> 17:57.968
you have 15 seconds
to enter the code

17:58.070 --> 17:59.381
- before the alarm goes off.
- What, are we under attack?

17:59.405 --> 18:01.004
We could be.

18:01.106 --> 18:03.140
- 12 seconds.
- What's the code?

18:03.242 --> 18:07.744
Your birthday, the day,
and then the month.

18:07.846 --> 18:08.846
And enter.

18:08.948 --> 18:11.949
Try it again.

18:15.587 --> 18:16.619
No, wait, wait.

18:16.721 --> 18:17.933
Clearly, you forgot my birthday.

18:17.957 --> 18:21.624
No. I got it.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.563
Please, stop this.

18:26.665 --> 18:27.976
Yeah, yeah. Hold on. Hold on.
One second.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.766
Hold on.
One second, one second.

18:31.103 --> 18:33.670
Griff!

18:43.949 --> 18:46.149
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

18:46.251 --> 18:47.985
Griff?

18:48.087 --> 18:51.621
I must have, uh... must have
got some wires crossed.

18:51.723 --> 18:52.889
Stop that.

18:52.992 --> 18:54.569
- What's the matter with you?
- Poison oak.

18:54.593 --> 18:55.953
The nurse said
it's from the woods.

18:57.029 --> 18:58.928
Come on.
Let's go watch TV.

18:59.031 --> 19:01.431
You guys go.
Get in here.

19:01.533 --> 19:02.832
Ooh.

19:02.934 --> 19:04.101
I can't do this.

19:04.203 --> 19:06.269
What?

19:08.474 --> 19:10.940
I can't retire.

19:11.043 --> 19:12.942
I don't know
how to be a civilian.

19:19.118 --> 19:23.353
You know, why don't you
come work at the store?

19:24.556 --> 19:25.755
What?

19:25.857 --> 19:27.469
Just until I get the other one
up and running.

19:27.493 --> 19:28.569
I could really use the help,

19:28.593 --> 19:31.928
and it would get you
out of the house.

19:33.765 --> 19:36.833
Is that fear in your eyes,
Colonel?

19:36.935 --> 19:38.101
Affirmative.

19:38.203 --> 19:40.203
You're good at giving orders.

19:40.305 --> 19:42.205
Now you can take them.

19:42.307 --> 19:45.442
For cupcakes.

19:47.279 --> 19:52.682
We rotate 32 varieties,
and daily specials are up front.

19:52.784 --> 19:55.352
We got chocolate sundae,
black raspberry.

19:55.454 --> 19:57.487
I'm a fan of banana.

19:57.589 --> 20:00.990
Okay.

20:02.528 --> 20:03.960
Oh, yeah.

20:04.063 --> 20:05.962
I'm... I'm not wearing these.

20:06.065 --> 20:08.731
Okay, well,
you're gonna wear this.

20:10.102 --> 20:12.802
- Honey, are you kidding me?
- What?

20:12.904 --> 20:13.981
Well, this looks ridiculous.

20:14.005 --> 20:15.772
Oh, honey,
it's part of the outfit.

20:15.874 --> 20:16.874
You gotta wear it.

20:16.942 --> 20:20.143
- Sweetheart...
- it gets worse.

20:23.282 --> 20:26.416
No, no. No way.

20:26.518 --> 20:27.951
It's health code reg.

20:28.053 --> 20:31.088
Only when you're baking
or icing, okay?

20:31.190 --> 20:33.590
It's okay.

20:33.692 --> 20:34.824
You look cute.

20:34.926 --> 20:36.793
I like to do the icing
with a knife,

20:36.895 --> 20:39.162
but it's a lot easier to use
the frosting gun.

20:39.264 --> 20:40.763
A gun? Okay.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.932
So you just go right here.

20:43.034 --> 20:47.904
Just swirl it around like that.

20:48.006 --> 20:49.872
Are you paying attention?

20:49.975 --> 20:51.741
- Roger that.
- You can do that.

20:51.843 --> 20:54.511
Honey, does she need to be here?

20:54.613 --> 20:56.346
Yes, just don't engage.

20:56.448 --> 20:58.748
And if she engages first?

20:58.850 --> 21:01.017
Surrender.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.153
Here, you try.

21:03.255 --> 21:04.754
Okay.
Fold those in.

21:04.856 --> 21:07.657
This goes over.
That goes over.

21:07.759 --> 21:09.237
Then you gotta put
these flaps in here.

21:09.261 --> 21:10.793
And they can be
a little tricky, okay?

21:10.895 --> 21:12.429
Any questions?

21:12.531 --> 21:13.597
Just one.

21:13.698 --> 21:15.832
Does everything
have to be so pink?

21:15.934 --> 21:18.001
You're embarrassed.
That's cute.

21:18.103 --> 21:19.603
Not helping.

21:19.704 --> 21:21.438
You know what,
maybe I should just stay.

21:21.540 --> 21:22.584
Sweetheart, no.
You go ahead.

21:22.608 --> 21:24.207
You go on your meeting.
I'll be fine.

21:24.309 --> 21:27.177
Don't worry.
I'll keep a short leash on him.

21:27.279 --> 21:29.112
Let's just go over this
one more time, here.

21:29.214 --> 21:31.593
Honey, honey, we've gone over
everything three times already.

21:31.617 --> 21:32.617
I've got it.

21:32.717 --> 21:34.317
I run a battalion
of over a thousand men.

21:34.419 --> 21:36.653
I can handle some cupcakes.

21:36.755 --> 21:38.855
Okay.

21:38.957 --> 21:39.856
I love you.

21:39.958 --> 21:43.593
I love you too.

21:43.695 --> 21:47.297
The place is in good hands.

21:47.399 --> 21:50.400
Bye.

22:19.764 --> 22:23.733
I realize how fascinating
this must be for you,

22:23.835 --> 22:25.380
but if you're back here,
you need the net.

22:25.404 --> 22:28.672
Okay.
Just an observation,

22:28.773 --> 22:32.509
but you could double your output
if you use both racks.

22:32.611 --> 22:34.678
I could.

22:34.779 --> 22:36.413
And, if this was a mess hall,
I would.

22:36.515 --> 22:38.114
But they cook better
with one rack.

22:38.217 --> 22:39.115
How much better
could they taste?

22:39.218 --> 22:41.251
It's just flour and water.

22:41.353 --> 22:44.421
Flour and water?

22:44.523 --> 22:48.725
And what, the Mona Lisa
is just paint on a canvas?

22:48.827 --> 22:49.827
Technically, yes.

22:49.894 --> 22:52.395
Are you telling me how to bake?

22:52.497 --> 22:55.498
Because I've been doing this
for 27 years.

22:55.601 --> 22:59.068
You've been here 27 minutes.

22:59.170 --> 23:00.537
You're in my world now.

23:00.639 --> 23:02.840
I'm just trying to make this
operation a little more efficient.

23:02.874 --> 23:04.874
Okay.

23:05.977 --> 23:07.611
You see this?

23:17.422 --> 23:19.088
That is your line in the sand.

23:19.190 --> 23:23.226
You stay on that side,
and we won't have any problems.

23:27.966 --> 23:29.699
You got a customer.

23:40.111 --> 23:41.811
Carson, I heard you were back.

23:41.913 --> 23:43.280
Hey, Harley, how you doing?

23:43.382 --> 23:44.481
How are you, man?

23:44.583 --> 23:46.583
Yeah, that's a nice color
on you.

23:46.685 --> 23:48.151
Oh, yeah.

23:48.253 --> 23:49.486
How'd you get roped into this?

23:49.588 --> 23:52.289
I got drafted, or I enlisted.
I don't know.

23:52.391 --> 23:54.324
I haven't seen you
since the Fort Benning days.

23:54.426 --> 23:55.525
Yeah.

23:55.627 --> 23:56.704
You're looking good, brother.

23:56.728 --> 23:58.361
Thank you.
You too.

23:58.463 --> 24:00.297
You know,
I've been out seven years now.

24:00.399 --> 24:01.743
I got the hardware store
over on pine.

24:01.767 --> 24:03.199
Hey, that's great.

24:03.302 --> 24:06.269
It is now.
At first, though, I don't know,

24:06.371 --> 24:08.271
I felt like a stranger
in my own life.

24:08.373 --> 24:10.807
- Yeah, I know what you mean.
- It gets easier.

24:10.909 --> 24:12.475
So you finally decided
to retire?

24:12.577 --> 24:16.846
Well, still deciding.
Actually, I'm up for General.

24:16.948 --> 24:18.981
General?

24:19.083 --> 24:20.550
Congrats, sir.

24:20.652 --> 24:22.519
Thank you.

24:22.621 --> 24:24.661
I don't think I've ever seen
a General in a hairnet.

24:26.991 --> 24:28.525
Can I get you something?

24:28.627 --> 24:30.427
Yeah. How about an apple crisp
and a coffee?

24:30.529 --> 24:32.529
Coming right up.

24:34.966 --> 24:37.333
So, dad, I heard you had
to wear an apron.

24:37.435 --> 24:38.801
And a hairnet.

24:38.903 --> 24:40.069
Harsh.

24:40.171 --> 24:41.871
Hey, you want to know
what's really harsh?

24:41.973 --> 24:44.273
- What?
- No, no, no, no, no.

24:44.375 --> 24:47.243
The boss wouldn't trust me
to be alone with the cakes.

24:47.345 --> 24:48.945
It was your first day.

24:49.047 --> 24:52.348
I'll trust you tomorrow.
Here, look.

24:52.450 --> 24:54.050
Here.

24:54.152 --> 24:55.317
Kim, dinner.

24:56.955 --> 24:59.689
Right?

24:59.791 --> 25:01.057
That's classified.
Delete that.

25:01.159 --> 25:03.559
Well, she'll just take
another one tomorrow.

25:03.662 --> 25:06.362
And by her, you mean Sheila?

25:06.464 --> 25:08.665
I'm afraid she sent
a mass email.

25:08.767 --> 25:10.667
That woman
has a personality problem.

25:10.769 --> 25:11.812
Well, you'll get used to her.

25:11.836 --> 25:12.935
Do I have to?

25:13.038 --> 25:15.571
For tomorrow night.

25:15.674 --> 25:17.907
What do you think?

25:18.009 --> 25:19.053
You look really pretty, honey.

25:19.077 --> 25:19.976
What's tomorrow night?

25:20.078 --> 25:21.277
I'm going out.
I told you.

25:21.379 --> 25:24.613
3.4 gpa, no tattoos,
no earrings?

25:24.716 --> 25:25.748
11:00 p.m. curfew,

25:25.850 --> 25:27.227
group date only,
and I want to meet him.

25:27.251 --> 25:29.752
You said when I was 16
I could go out alone.

25:29.854 --> 25:30.854
I meant 17.

25:30.955 --> 25:32.521
That's not fair.
Mom?

25:32.623 --> 25:35.524
Yup.
Yeah, we said 16.

25:40.665 --> 25:43.099
I just didn't think
it would get here that quick.

25:50.259 --> 25:51.892
Ollie, come on.

25:51.994 --> 25:53.694
Get up.

25:55.564 --> 25:56.897
Remember when you were little,

25:56.999 --> 25:59.132
we used to run
the obstacle course on base?

25:59.234 --> 26:01.001
- I did?
- Yeah.

26:01.103 --> 26:02.603
Three days a week,
rain or shine.

26:02.705 --> 26:04.170
How come we stopped
living on base?

26:04.273 --> 26:05.639
Well, I got transferred
to Germany.

26:05.741 --> 26:07.018
Your mother and I decided
we didn't want

26:07.042 --> 26:08.776
to uproot you guys anymore.

26:08.878 --> 26:11.244
- Why?
- Well, you had friends,

26:11.346 --> 26:12.646
you had school.

26:12.748 --> 26:16.082
We wanted you guys to have
as normal an upbringing as possible.

26:16.184 --> 26:17.618
Normal's overrated.

26:17.720 --> 26:20.387
And growing up an army brat
can be tough.

26:20.489 --> 26:21.655
I should know.

26:21.757 --> 26:25.492
It's just that I wish
you'd been around more.

26:25.594 --> 26:28.028
Me too, buddy.

26:35.070 --> 26:37.604
I've been waiting
for ten minutes.

26:37.706 --> 26:39.139
The usual, please!

26:39.241 --> 26:40.707
- Come on.
- Let's go.

27:06.469 --> 27:07.668
Where's Janet?

27:07.770 --> 27:10.136
It's just me today.

27:10.238 --> 27:12.639
She left you alone
on Friday rush?

27:12.741 --> 27:15.241
It's a cupcake store.
I think I can handle it.

27:15.344 --> 27:17.544
Okay.

27:22.150 --> 27:23.283
Good morning, ladies.

27:23.385 --> 27:26.386
- That must be the husband.
- Where's his apron?

27:34.730 --> 27:36.429
Good morning.

27:37.353 --> 27:38.064
What can I get you ladies?

27:38.166 --> 27:40.000
Two decaf, two angel food.

27:40.102 --> 27:43.971
Two decaf, two angel.

27:44.072 --> 27:46.373
Janet gives us
the decaf for free.

27:46.475 --> 27:48.174
Okay.

27:50.445 --> 27:52.178
Janet brings our order
to the table.

27:52.280 --> 27:54.548
Of course.

27:57.653 --> 28:01.989
Apparently, nickels
aren't good enough for him.

28:02.090 --> 28:03.256
All right, here, come on.

28:03.358 --> 28:05.069
- And take some more...
- hurry up. Open your purse.

28:05.093 --> 28:06.527
Yeah, all right.
It's open.

28:06.629 --> 28:07.739
All right, all right, all right.

28:07.763 --> 28:09.329
Open it harder.
I can't get every...

28:09.431 --> 28:10.330
I can't get the sweetener
in there.

28:10.432 --> 28:11.999
I'm doing the best I can.

28:12.100 --> 28:13.500
Don't make me nervous, please.

28:13.602 --> 28:14.880
I'm not trying
to make you nervous.

28:14.904 --> 28:16.603
- I just wanna...
- Just fill up the thing.

28:16.705 --> 28:18.639
Your husband needs this.

28:18.741 --> 28:24.011
Well, my husband
needs a lot of things.

28:24.112 --> 28:27.147
- What is he doing?
- Well, I don't know.

28:27.249 --> 28:29.115
He looks so out of his element.

28:29.217 --> 28:30.717
This is a fish-out-of-water comedy.

28:30.819 --> 28:32.719
He can't even read.
What is going on?

28:32.821 --> 28:34.054
Why doesn't he use those...

28:34.156 --> 28:35.422
I don't believe it.

28:35.524 --> 28:37.257
He should not be wearing
those glasses.

28:37.359 --> 28:38.525
Those are hideous.

28:38.627 --> 28:41.127
- He's a fashion disaster.
- He is.

28:41.229 --> 28:45.365
Okay, ladies. Two coffees,
and two angel foods.

28:46.669 --> 28:48.401
This is not decaf.

28:48.503 --> 28:50.203
I'm sure it is decaf, ma'am.

28:50.305 --> 28:52.573
We'll have hot water with lemon.

28:52.675 --> 28:56.276
Of course.

28:56.378 --> 28:59.345
- I hope these are better.
- What's going on with Janet?

28:59.448 --> 29:02.348
I swear, I don't know
what she... this is ridiculous.

29:02.451 --> 29:06.186
- Can I get a little help here?
- Right there.

29:06.288 --> 29:08.288
Excuse me. Hi.
Can I have two hot flan?

29:08.390 --> 29:10.090
- Whoa.
- I was first.

29:10.192 --> 29:11.458
Chocolate mousse.

29:13.796 --> 29:14.895
Hello?

29:14.997 --> 29:17.330
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Who was first?

29:17.432 --> 29:18.944
Excuse me.
Can I get two hot flan, please?

29:18.968 --> 29:20.701
- Whoa, excuse me.
- I was first.

29:20.803 --> 29:22.280
- Chocolate mousse.
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

29:22.304 --> 29:24.237
- Wait one second.
- Are you serious?

29:27.843 --> 29:29.810
I don't wanna argue with you,
ladies.

29:29.912 --> 29:31.244
That does not mean anything.

29:31.346 --> 29:32.423
Listen, I was here first.
I have to go to work.

29:32.447 --> 29:33.346
No, no, it does mean something.

29:33.448 --> 29:34.581
It does not mean anything.

29:34.683 --> 29:36.717
Because I come here
all the time.

29:36.819 --> 29:38.451
This is Carson, sir.

29:38.553 --> 29:40.087
I just wanted to give you
a heads up.

29:40.188 --> 29:42.990
The promotions board is
reviewing your file this week.

29:43.092 --> 29:44.858
That's excellent, sir.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.559
Everything all right over there?

29:46.662 --> 29:48.528
Yeah, yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.

29:48.631 --> 29:50.797
I'm just helping out the wife
at her shop, sir.

29:50.899 --> 29:53.333
Get back to it.
I'll be in touch.

29:53.435 --> 29:56.169
Thank you, sir.

29:59.608 --> 30:01.474
Okay.
So who had the hot flashes?

30:01.576 --> 30:03.510
- That's you, right?
- Hot fl... excuse me?

30:03.612 --> 30:04.811
And you're the mousse?

30:04.913 --> 30:06.091
- What did you call me?
- Out of line.

30:06.115 --> 30:07.781
- What?
- Look, you know what?

30:07.883 --> 30:08.949
I'm... no, you didn't.

30:09.051 --> 30:10.517
I'm not coming back.
I'm done.

30:10.619 --> 30:12.285
No. What?
What?

30:12.387 --> 30:14.788
No, ma'am,
no, I didn't, I didn't...

30:14.890 --> 30:16.156
hello? Hello?

30:16.258 --> 30:17.490
Hi, coffee, please.
To go.

30:17.592 --> 30:19.292
Yes, ma'am, absolutely.

30:19.394 --> 30:20.293
Okay, no.
No hot water.

30:20.395 --> 30:21.395
Excuse me.
I was first.

30:21.463 --> 30:22.463
Chocolate mousse.

30:22.497 --> 30:24.230
Wait a second.
No.

30:24.332 --> 30:25.332
No, you were not first.

30:25.433 --> 30:26.611
Two waters with lemon.
Come on.

30:26.635 --> 30:28.201
Right away.
I'm so sorry. One second.

30:28.303 --> 30:30.671
Sheila, could I get a hand
out here, please?

30:30.773 --> 30:31.905
I've been waiting forever.

30:32.007 --> 30:34.141
- Are you totally inept?
- Excuse me?

30:34.242 --> 30:35.575
Just fill the order, you loser.

30:35.678 --> 30:36.810
All right, that's it.

30:36.912 --> 30:38.145
Then get Phil on the phone.

30:38.246 --> 30:39.546
A dozen buttermilk to go.

30:39.648 --> 30:42.149
Yes, of course.
Buttermilk. You got it.

30:42.250 --> 30:45.719
- The coffee, please. First.
- Yes, ma'am.

30:45.821 --> 30:47.888
- To go.
- To go? Yeah, of course.

30:47.990 --> 30:49.333
Not to go for you,
but, yes, to go for you.

30:49.357 --> 30:50.490
Right, I got it.

30:50.592 --> 30:52.270
And two waters with...
the hot water with lemon.

30:52.294 --> 30:55.361
Do you remember that finally?
Thank you.

30:55.463 --> 30:56.963
Okay.

30:57.066 --> 31:00.466
One moment.
One second.

31:00.569 --> 31:02.736
Be right with you.

31:16.085 --> 31:17.483
I'm so sorry.

31:17.586 --> 31:20.420
I want my flan.

31:36.205 --> 31:38.271
Hi, honey.

31:41.376 --> 31:42.408
Sorry.

31:55.461 --> 31:58.628
So, dad, mom gave you
the old ax?

31:58.731 --> 32:00.630
No.
Your dad and I decided

32:00.733 --> 32:04.334
that it would be best
if his time was spent elsewhere.

32:18.484 --> 32:22.819
Dad, this is Ray.

32:27.860 --> 32:29.626
Good to meet you.

32:29.728 --> 32:32.061
I mean,
under normal circumstances,

32:32.163 --> 32:35.198
mister... Colonel, sir.

32:35.300 --> 32:36.733
Wait, when did you two meet?

32:36.835 --> 32:38.402
So you're interested
in my daughter?

32:38.504 --> 32:39.569
Dad, please.

32:39.671 --> 32:42.138
I think she's the bomb, sir.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.640
I work with bombs, Ray.

32:43.742 --> 32:45.475
They explode.

32:45.577 --> 32:46.877
Poor choice of words.

32:46.978 --> 32:48.712
What I meant was

32:48.814 --> 32:53.717
I think
she's a very nice girl, sir.

32:53.819 --> 32:57.421
She used to wear pink.
Now she wears black.

32:57.523 --> 32:58.422
You have anything
to do with that, Ray?

32:58.524 --> 33:00.690
- No, I don't think so.
- Dad.

33:00.793 --> 33:02.158
We're just going to the movies.

33:02.260 --> 33:03.760
- What movie?
- A vampire movie.

33:03.862 --> 33:06.963
Nc-17?
She's 16.

33:07.065 --> 33:11.968
No. It's a... it's pg.
It's g.

33:12.070 --> 33:13.750
I assume you have
a valid driver's license.

33:13.806 --> 33:15.772
Yeah.

33:18.677 --> 33:19.943
Proof of insurance?

33:20.045 --> 33:22.312
It's in the car.

33:26.318 --> 33:29.786
Ha-ho, is that the vehicle
you plan

33:29.888 --> 33:31.755
on driving
my daughter around in, Ray?

33:31.857 --> 33:34.491
- Well, I...
- yes or no?

33:37.162 --> 33:40.530
I'm sorry, Kim.

33:40.632 --> 33:44.334
I just remembered that I have
this thing that I have to...

33:44.436 --> 33:48.371
okay.

33:54.546 --> 33:57.113
You just ruined my life.

33:57.215 --> 34:02.185
I was just asking him
some questions, honey.

34:02.287 --> 34:04.087
I mean, if that's
gonna break him down...

34:10.896 --> 34:14.864
Nick and his dad are taking me
to the batting cages.

34:14.967 --> 34:16.533
You're not coming, right?

34:16.635 --> 34:17.868
Right.

34:17.969 --> 34:20.335
Got it.
Love you.

34:21.873 --> 34:24.708
Love you too.

34:24.810 --> 34:28.210
- That went well.
- Yeah, you were the bomb.

34:36.788 --> 34:40.757
Honey?

34:40.859 --> 34:42.893
You think we made a mistake?

34:42.995 --> 34:46.730
Hundreds.

34:46.831 --> 34:50.000
I can't help thinking
if I didn't take

34:50.101 --> 34:52.735
that commission to Germany...

34:52.838 --> 34:54.771
I'd be one of you now.

34:54.873 --> 34:58.708
I wouldn't have to catch up
or fight my way back in.

35:02.147 --> 35:04.014
You are one of us.

35:04.115 --> 35:06.716
Everything's changed so much.

35:06.818 --> 35:09.352
The kids,
they're not kids anymore.

35:09.454 --> 35:12.355
And you're... you're doing so well
without me.

35:14.660 --> 35:16.960
We're doing so much better
with you.

35:17.062 --> 35:20.229
Janet.

35:20.331 --> 35:22.231
Janet, you there?

35:22.333 --> 35:24.200
Hello?

35:24.302 --> 35:28.304
Look, I heard about the disaster
in the bakery today.

35:29.708 --> 35:33.443
It was a bad day.
That's all.

35:33.545 --> 35:35.478
I disagree.

35:35.581 --> 35:39.082
I mean, what he does in that
store affects the new store.

36:40.743 --> 36:42.075
Hi, how are you?

36:42.178 --> 36:43.644
- How are you?
- Hi.

37:01.830 --> 37:03.397
What are you doing?

37:03.499 --> 37:05.633
Honey, yesterday wasn't pretty.

37:05.734 --> 37:07.034
I know that.

37:07.136 --> 37:11.272
I lost focus, but right now
I am in the zone.

37:11.374 --> 37:13.385
I've been up all night running
through a list of things

37:13.409 --> 37:14.841
to tighten up operations.

37:15.243 --> 37:18.912
Pink boxes assembled in advance.

37:19.014 --> 37:22.916
Result, more one-on-one time
to serve the cupcakers' needs.

37:24.252 --> 37:25.986
Please.

37:26.088 --> 37:30.757
All items relabeled much bigger,
much easier to read.

37:30.860 --> 37:34.394
Minimizes indecision.

37:34.497 --> 37:37.063
Instead of a free-for-all
at the counter,

37:37.165 --> 37:39.933
we encourage
a single-file orderly line-up.

37:40.035 --> 37:42.970
Increased turnover,
increased sales.

37:44.573 --> 37:45.939
Look, honey, I know

37:46.041 --> 37:47.185
I wasn't up for this job
to begin with.

37:47.209 --> 37:49.943
I underestimated it.
But I can do this.

37:50.045 --> 37:51.879
You don't have to do this.

37:51.981 --> 37:53.747
Yes, I do.

37:53.849 --> 37:56.783
Pink may not be
my color of choice,

37:56.886 --> 37:58.351
but I am no quitter.

37:58.453 --> 38:00.253
Excuse me?

38:00.355 --> 38:02.422
May I help you?
Hi.

38:02.525 --> 38:04.357
Yes. I'd like two
of these, please.

38:04.459 --> 38:06.459
Great choice.
Fantastic.

38:06.562 --> 38:08.194
- And you, sir?
- You know what?

38:08.296 --> 38:09.936
I'm just gonna need
a couple things to go.

38:09.965 --> 38:12.633
- Absolutely.
- He's back?

38:12.735 --> 38:15.168
He's back.

38:17.806 --> 38:19.472
Thank you very much.
Come again.

38:19.575 --> 38:21.408
Thank you.

38:24.613 --> 38:26.713
All right, babe.

38:26.815 --> 38:28.214
- Honey?
- Yes?

38:28.316 --> 38:30.784
That enemy bakery is stealing
all your morning customers.

38:30.886 --> 38:34.120
They're not the enemy,
and they're not my customers.

38:34.222 --> 38:36.322
Well, they could be.

38:36.425 --> 38:38.759
Uh, no.
My customers start at 11:00 a.m.

38:38.861 --> 38:41.762
Whatever you're thinking, don't.

38:41.864 --> 38:44.798
It doesn't make sense.

38:44.900 --> 38:46.767
- Him again.
- Hey.

38:46.869 --> 38:49.069
Colonel, I didn't expect
to see you back here.

38:49.171 --> 38:52.005
It's funny. I expect
to see you wherever I turn.

38:52.107 --> 38:53.740
Griff's running the store.

38:53.842 --> 38:55.453
Well, I'm sure you guys
have thought this out.

38:55.477 --> 38:56.910
- Yes. We have.
- Yeah.

38:57.012 --> 38:58.256
Janet, we really ought to hit it

38:58.280 --> 38:59.780
if we're gonna meet
the contractors.

38:59.882 --> 39:02.182
Yes. Okay. All right.
Bye. I love you.

39:02.284 --> 39:03.349
Love you.

39:05.020 --> 39:06.820
Thank you.

39:18.433 --> 39:20.867
Hey, what's up, man?

39:20.970 --> 39:22.202
I heard someone's coffee cup

39:22.304 --> 39:23.882
calling for a little more
coffee, am I right?

39:23.906 --> 39:25.772
- There we go.
- Yes, please.

39:25.874 --> 39:28.075
There we go.
Enjoy, ladies.

39:28.176 --> 39:29.409
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

39:29.511 --> 39:31.411
You can't finish that, hmm?

39:39.488 --> 39:40.821
Can I help you?

39:40.923 --> 39:42.823
No.

39:42.925 --> 39:45.058
Like a little coffee?

39:45.160 --> 39:47.494
No, I'm fine.
Thanks.

39:52.654 --> 39:54.186
A little more decaf, ladies?

39:54.289 --> 39:55.755
Half a cup.

39:55.857 --> 39:58.524
Yes, ma'am.

39:58.627 --> 40:00.393
Yes, ma'am.

40:00.495 --> 40:01.535
Thank you.
You're learning.

40:02.797 --> 40:04.275
So you're gonna give me
the brisket recipe?

40:04.299 --> 40:05.743
I'll give it to you,
but you just look it up.

40:05.767 --> 40:07.032
<i>It's in the joy of cooking.</i>

40:07.135 --> 40:09.068
It's from a book?

40:09.170 --> 40:11.771
Well, why not?
It's a cookbook.

40:11.873 --> 40:13.317
Please, I thought your mother
gave it to you.

40:13.341 --> 40:15.007
What an adorable little one.

40:15.109 --> 40:16.754
- Thank you.
- What can I do for you today?

40:16.778 --> 40:18.144
Well, Ashley Ann is turning one,

40:18.246 --> 40:22.382
and we need 100 cupcakes
to match this color swatch.

40:23.252 --> 40:24.617
So what do you suggest?

40:24.719 --> 40:26.064
Well, our display case
is right here.

40:26.088 --> 40:27.331
Why don't you take a look
at the display case

40:27.355 --> 40:28.789
while I figure this one out?

40:28.891 --> 40:29.956
All right, sounds good.

40:30.058 --> 40:33.359
Thank you.

40:39.968 --> 40:41.179
I think you should go
with ballerina.

40:41.203 --> 40:43.003
- Not Pink Lady?
- Nah.

40:43.105 --> 40:45.438
Pink Lady's
got a bluish undertone to it.

40:45.540 --> 40:47.340
Well, if anything I was thinking

40:47.442 --> 40:48.708
it leans more toward magenta.

40:48.811 --> 40:50.243
- Magenta?
- Yes, I do.

40:50.345 --> 40:53.113
Look... look at us.
What are we doing?

40:53.215 --> 40:54.815
We used to talk
about troop deployments.

40:54.917 --> 40:57.617
- Now...
- Ashley Ann likes Pink Lady.

40:59.021 --> 41:01.855
Can you have those ready
by tomorrow morning?

41:03.258 --> 41:05.926
- Absolutely.
- Great, thank you.

41:06.028 --> 41:07.588
Thank you.
We'll see you in the morning.

41:07.629 --> 41:09.029
We'll see you then.

41:10.765 --> 41:13.133
I think they're doing more
than redecorating.

41:13.235 --> 41:15.202
I can't have those ready
by tomorrow.

41:15.304 --> 41:17.370
You can if you use both racks.

41:17.472 --> 41:19.405
You know my rack policy.

41:19.507 --> 41:22.843
Change it.

41:25.380 --> 41:27.513
Don't let Sheila catch you.

41:27.615 --> 41:29.082
Never.

41:49.771 --> 41:51.338
That is funny.

41:56.011 --> 41:57.077
How about you?

41:57.179 --> 41:58.289
What's going on
in the lady department?

41:58.313 --> 41:59.212
- Stop.
- What?

41:59.314 --> 42:03.716
Come on.

42:10.359 --> 42:14.327
- You're mean.
- I'm not mean.

42:24.806 --> 42:25.972
Yeah, Jim, it's Carson.

42:26.074 --> 42:30.543
I need a background check
on a civilian, asap.

42:31.914 --> 42:33.146
Hello, everyone.

42:33.248 --> 42:34.314
Thank you.
Hey, honey!

42:34.416 --> 42:36.149
Hi, sweetheart.
How are you doing?

42:42.557 --> 42:43.723
The place looks great.

42:43.825 --> 42:45.191
Thanks.
We think so.

42:45.294 --> 42:49.195
Why don't I take everybody out
for a little family dinner?

42:49.298 --> 42:51.497
We just ate.
Thad brought us some Thai food.

42:51.599 --> 42:53.633
Yeah. I'm sorry, honey.
The kids were starving.

42:53.735 --> 42:55.335
No problem at all.

42:55.437 --> 42:56.747
There's leftover mee krob
if you wanna pick through it.

42:56.771 --> 42:57.870
How thoughtful.

42:57.973 --> 42:59.450
You know what?
This is the electrician.

42:59.474 --> 43:00.907
I'll be right back.

43:01.009 --> 43:02.575
All right.

43:04.612 --> 43:06.346
Yeah.

43:06.448 --> 43:08.359
Janet tells me you had
a decent day at the store.

43:08.383 --> 43:10.183
Yeah, yeah, we moved some cakes.

43:10.285 --> 43:12.152
You know, I have to admit

43:12.254 --> 43:15.355
I wasn't really all that thrilled
about you going back in there.

43:15.457 --> 43:16.700
But I get that
you're trying to be useful

43:16.724 --> 43:18.825
while you're home,
so it's good for you.

43:18.927 --> 43:22.262
Yeah.
Well, that means...

43:22.364 --> 43:23.896
A lot.

43:23.999 --> 43:25.609
You know what,
if there's anything I can do

43:25.633 --> 43:27.700
for Janet, you know,
or the family, I'm there.

43:27.802 --> 43:30.170
Well, I appreciate that.

43:30.272 --> 43:33.139
You know what, actually,
there is one little thing.

43:33.241 --> 43:34.441
Done.
Name it.

43:34.542 --> 43:36.343
Well, it concerns
your Toyota out there.

43:36.445 --> 43:37.344
Mercedes.

43:37.446 --> 43:40.380
Right, because I was
teaching Kim how to drive,

43:40.482 --> 43:42.648
and that seems much more
maneuverable than the minivan,

43:42.750 --> 43:44.917
so that would be just fantastic.

43:45.020 --> 43:46.540
Thank you very much.
Just a quick spin,

43:46.621 --> 43:49.122
no problem at all.
Come on, hon.

43:49.224 --> 43:52.325
- Thank you so much, Thad.
- Yeah, sure.

43:52.427 --> 43:54.260
Appreciate that.

44:00.168 --> 44:03.535
Honey, what do you see
when you go to the mall?

44:03.637 --> 44:04.937
Clothes stores?

44:05.039 --> 44:06.116
Do you want to know what I see?

44:06.140 --> 44:08.874
I see shoplifters.
I see pickpockets.

44:08.976 --> 44:11.510
I see an overcrowded escalator.

44:11.612 --> 44:14.446
I see an unchecked flame
at the chicken joint.

44:14.548 --> 44:15.848
Okay?

44:15.950 --> 44:18.150
You have to constantly be
reassessing the threat level.

44:18.252 --> 44:20.586
That's how you become
a defensive driver.

44:20.688 --> 44:23.022
- Okay.
- Okay. Now...

44:23.124 --> 44:25.191
This really is nice, isn't it?

44:25.292 --> 44:26.826
- Yeah.
- Okay.

44:26.928 --> 44:29.461
Now, what you do is you take
that key thingy...

44:29.563 --> 44:31.931
You stick it
inside that little slot, right?

44:32.033 --> 44:34.233
Now put it into drive.

44:34.335 --> 44:35.946
- Put your blinker on.
- I did, I did, I did.

44:35.970 --> 44:38.503
Okay.
Now, calmly go ten and two.

44:38.606 --> 44:40.806
You pull out nice and easy.
There you go, honey.

45:15.376 --> 45:17.276
What are you doing?
Are you gonna come to bed?

45:17.378 --> 45:18.911
Yeah, honey,
I'll be right there.

45:19.013 --> 45:21.747
Okay.

45:32.722 --> 45:36.591
Maple bacon cupcakes
are our new morning cupcakes.

45:36.693 --> 45:39.727
We are now open every
single morning at 7:00 a.m.

45:39.829 --> 45:40.995
Come on inside.

45:41.097 --> 45:42.375
If you like those,
we got plenty more inside.

45:42.399 --> 45:43.831
Absolutely, here you are.

45:43.933 --> 45:46.501
Free cup of coffee with
every single cupcake purchased.

45:46.603 --> 45:47.802
Thank you, sir.

45:47.904 --> 45:49.203
There you are, ma'am.
Here, sir.

45:49.306 --> 45:51.872
Maple bacon,
one of our many, many flavors.

45:51.974 --> 45:53.574
Thank you very much.
There you are.

45:53.677 --> 45:56.511
We're open every morning
from 7:00 a.m.

45:56.613 --> 45:57.712
Thank you, sir.

45:57.814 --> 46:00.715
You're starting a war, you know.

46:00.817 --> 46:04.352
Sheila, why don't you go
inside and have a latte?

46:04.454 --> 46:07.789
I'm lactose intolerant.

46:07.890 --> 46:10.991
Or maybe just intolerant.

46:11.093 --> 46:13.361
I heard that.

46:15.031 --> 46:17.799
Here,
try our maple bacon cupcakes.

46:17.900 --> 46:19.600
We're open every single morning.

46:19.703 --> 46:21.268
Thank you.

46:25.542 --> 46:26.542
And here we are.

46:26.643 --> 46:27.753
Half a dozen
I'm a fan of bananas.

46:27.777 --> 46:28.954
Thank you very much.
Next, please.

46:28.978 --> 46:30.445
I know.
Honestly, she's so delusional

46:30.547 --> 46:31.957
if she thinks she's going
over the exact same...

46:31.981 --> 46:33.125
no talking on the cell phone,
please.

46:33.149 --> 46:34.159
I'm just going
to revoke her invitation.

46:34.183 --> 46:35.916
I know.

46:36.018 --> 46:37.196
I know.
That's what I told her...

46:37.220 --> 46:39.286
excuse me.

46:39.389 --> 46:42.523
But that's not happening.
Yeah, I know, right?

46:42.625 --> 46:43.736
- Yeah, unless you were...
- Ladies, I'm gonna have

46:43.760 --> 46:45.570
to ask you to empty out
your purses, please.

46:45.694 --> 46:47.027
I beg your pardon?

46:47.129 --> 46:48.429
The bags.
Open them up.

46:48.531 --> 46:49.863
What are you suggesting?

46:49.965 --> 46:51.325
I'm suggesting
that you're stealing

46:51.367 --> 46:52.566
all of my sugar.

46:52.668 --> 46:54.479
I mean, how much sugar
can one person really need?

46:54.503 --> 46:56.002
How dare you?

46:56.105 --> 46:57.204
I don't like your tone.

46:57.306 --> 46:58.338
Please open the bags.

46:58.441 --> 46:59.973
- Certainly not.
- No.

47:00.076 --> 47:01.076
We're on a fixed income.

47:01.177 --> 47:02.676
You don't pay anything
for this stuff.

47:02.778 --> 47:04.789
- Please open them up.
- I'm not gonna take anymore.

47:04.813 --> 47:05.924
- We're out of here.
- Let's go. Bye.

47:05.948 --> 47:07.681
- Like she says.
- This is last time

47:07.783 --> 47:08.848
I'm ever coming in here.

47:08.951 --> 47:10.384
Absolutely.
Never again.

47:10.486 --> 47:13.220
Excuse me.

47:13.322 --> 47:14.322
Yeah.
That's like...

47:14.423 --> 47:15.655
no cell phones, please.

47:15.757 --> 47:17.724
Buying the exact same dress.
I know.

47:17.826 --> 47:19.546
That's what I told her,
and I told my mom...

47:19.595 --> 47:20.760
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

47:20.862 --> 47:21.982
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, totally.

47:22.030 --> 47:24.030
That sign back there.

47:24.133 --> 47:26.766
- One second.
- No talking on the cell phone.

47:26.868 --> 47:29.936
Sorry. Excuse me,
but my father's the mayor.

47:30.038 --> 47:31.972
- Your father's the mayor?
- That's right.

47:32.074 --> 47:34.908
My father fought the Viet Cong
for six years.

47:35.010 --> 47:37.877
His father went M.I.A.
In World War II.

47:37.980 --> 47:39.913
They sacrificed for your right

47:40.015 --> 47:43.083
to talk on the phone,
just not in this store.

47:43.185 --> 47:45.785
I have no idea
what you just said,

47:45.887 --> 47:48.589
but my sweet 16 order,
cancel it.

47:48.690 --> 47:51.125
Okay, you have no idea
how crazy this guy is.

47:51.227 --> 47:53.460
Canceled.
Phone talker.

47:53.562 --> 47:55.862
Janet is going to kill you.

47:59.001 --> 48:02.002
The sign was clearly posted.
"No cell phones".

48:02.104 --> 48:05.172
That was our biggest order,
not to mention the publicity.

48:05.274 --> 48:06.607
Collateral damage.

48:06.708 --> 48:09.009
It's not collateral.
It's just damage.

48:09.111 --> 48:11.778
I'll call the mayor's office
tomorrow.

48:11.880 --> 48:13.024
No, you won't.
You're gonna stand

48:13.048 --> 48:16.016
behind the counter
and take orders.

48:16.118 --> 48:18.118
Yes, ma'am.

48:23.225 --> 48:25.526
There you go.
Thank you very much.

48:25.628 --> 48:27.127
Hey, dad.

48:27.229 --> 48:28.395
Hey, Ollie.

48:28.497 --> 48:30.597
Hey, can you donate
100 cupcakes?

48:30.699 --> 48:32.419
Not now, buddy.
I'm a little bit busy, okay?

48:32.468 --> 48:33.811
But it's
for my baseball fundraiser.

48:33.835 --> 48:35.101
I understand, okay?

48:35.204 --> 48:36.102
Why don't you go in the back
and do some homework?

48:36.205 --> 48:37.245
We'll talk about it later.

48:37.339 --> 48:38.779
- Fine.
- Come on, go, go, go, buddy.

48:38.874 --> 48:41.642
Okay. Who's next?

48:44.280 --> 48:46.146
What can I do for you?

48:46.248 --> 48:48.815
You can give me
my morning customers back.

48:48.917 --> 48:53.320
It's called
the spirit of competition.

48:55.257 --> 48:57.257
On the house.

48:58.894 --> 49:02.028
You want competition?
Fine.

49:02.130 --> 49:04.331
I'm gonna go after
the mayor's daughter's sweet 16.

49:04.433 --> 49:06.333
Bring it on.

49:19.815 --> 49:22.249
Oh, it is on!

49:32.894 --> 49:34.428
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

49:34.530 --> 49:36.530
We're in combat mode, Sheila.
Change of strategy.

49:36.632 --> 49:37.997
Take that pan out of there.

49:38.100 --> 49:39.233
We need more supply.

49:39.335 --> 49:41.045
We are gonna bake that guy
right off the block.

49:41.069 --> 49:42.369
Take that pan out of there,

49:42.471 --> 49:44.471
and you get back
to your designated area.

49:44.573 --> 49:46.005
Or what?

49:49.010 --> 49:51.411
I quit.

49:54.216 --> 49:56.082
Who's next?

49:56.184 --> 49:57.651
Hey, man.
Everything all right?

49:57.753 --> 49:59.419
Grab an apron.

49:59.521 --> 50:02.289
Move, soldier.
Grab an apron!

50:03.559 --> 50:06.660
Yeah. I know
what you're talking about.

50:06.762 --> 50:10.397
Yes. I know.
I saw the lease agreement. Yeah.

50:10.499 --> 50:14.067
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah, I have it.

50:22.010 --> 50:24.878
You know, I gotta call you back.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.266
Ooh.

50:50.806 --> 50:51.849
And how can I help you today?

50:51.873 --> 50:56.042
Can I get three pink ladies,
two crazy key limes, and...

50:56.144 --> 51:00.213
excuse me for one second.

51:00.316 --> 51:02.282
- Sorry?
- Ollie, honey?

51:02.384 --> 51:03.561
- Yeah.
- Is that your backpack

51:03.585 --> 51:06.353
in the corner over there?

51:06.455 --> 51:07.854
No.
Mine's right here.

51:07.956 --> 51:09.756
And I'd like...

51:09.858 --> 51:12.759
one moment, sorry.

51:12.861 --> 51:14.428
Kim!
Kim, sweetheart,

51:14.530 --> 51:16.763
that your backpack
over there in the corner?

51:16.865 --> 51:18.231
- Mm-mm.
- Yours?

51:18.334 --> 51:20.900
Excuse me, everyone.

51:21.002 --> 51:23.082
I'm sorry. Does this backpack
belong to anybody here?

51:23.171 --> 51:24.705
- Not mine.
- No. It's not.

51:24.807 --> 51:25.839
No. Sorry.

51:25.941 --> 51:28.208
Okay, folks,
we have a situation here.

51:28.310 --> 51:30.310
I want everybody to stay calm.
Honey, don't.

51:30.412 --> 51:32.879
- Why?
- Possible I.E.D.

51:32.981 --> 51:34.381
- O.M.G.
- Okay, everybody.

51:34.483 --> 51:37.517
Calmly, calmly, please exit
the premises, please.

51:37.619 --> 51:40.086
Okay, move,
move, move, move, move.

51:54.903 --> 51:58.438
No, wait. No, no, no, no, no.
There's a...

52:13.889 --> 52:15.922
What's going on?

52:17.526 --> 52:18.925
Oh, my god.

52:38.814 --> 52:41.915
Fortunately,
it's just water damage.

52:42.017 --> 52:45.218
But it'll be a few weeks
before they can start repairs.

52:45.320 --> 52:46.586
A few weeks?

52:46.688 --> 52:47.728
Our vendors are backed up.

52:47.823 --> 52:50.023
I'm sorry.
We'll be in touch.

52:57.666 --> 53:01.301
Go wait in the car.

53:09.611 --> 53:12.378
You are like a weapon
of mass destruction.

53:12.481 --> 53:13.947
I can fix it.

53:14.049 --> 53:18.485
Really?

53:18.587 --> 53:20.821
Can you fix that?

53:20.923 --> 53:22.522
That I can explain.

53:22.624 --> 53:25.091
I could care less
about this store,

53:25.193 --> 53:26.633
and I could care less
about cupcakes,

53:26.662 --> 53:28.194
but you not trusting me...

53:28.296 --> 53:29.629
Honey, I trust you.

53:29.731 --> 53:32.065
It's him I don't trust.
Thad.

53:33.335 --> 53:34.801
This guy is trying
to tear us apart.

53:34.903 --> 53:36.903
Oh, no, I think you're doing
a really good job

53:37.005 --> 53:38.071
of that yourself.

53:38.173 --> 53:40.073
For years, I have dreamt

53:40.175 --> 53:42.208
about you being back home
and us being happy.

53:42.310 --> 53:43.910
But you know what?

53:44.012 --> 53:47.848
I think... I sometimes think

53:47.950 --> 53:50.383
that the reason
why we're still together

53:50.486 --> 53:51.952
is because you're never here.

53:52.053 --> 53:55.489
Honey, don't even say that.

53:55.591 --> 53:57.423
I think that it would be best

53:57.526 --> 53:59.425
if you slept somewhere else
tonight.

53:59.528 --> 54:00.760
Just tonight?

54:00.863 --> 54:04.330
No.

54:13.742 --> 54:16.275
Your car is fixed.

54:49.472 --> 54:51.172
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

54:51.274 --> 54:53.207
Thanks for letting me crash here
tonight.

54:53.309 --> 54:55.242
Hey, no problem.

54:55.344 --> 54:57.244
All right.

54:57.346 --> 54:58.779
You sure your wife doesn't mind?

54:58.881 --> 55:01.915
Considering she's in Cleveland,

55:02.017 --> 55:03.717
I think it's fine.

55:03.819 --> 55:04.885
She's away?

55:04.987 --> 55:08.822
Going on six years now.

55:08.924 --> 55:10.357
Sorry.
I didn't know that.

55:10.459 --> 55:11.659
I was gonna mention it to you,

55:11.760 --> 55:13.460
but I didn't want
to discourage you.

55:13.563 --> 55:17.565
Well, I'm officially
discouraged.

55:27.976 --> 55:29.376
I really screwed up today.

55:44.126 --> 55:47.428
Hey, man, no cutting.
Get in the back of the line.

55:47.530 --> 55:49.162
I know.

55:49.265 --> 55:51.198
I owe you an apology.

55:51.300 --> 55:55.135
Nah, no apology necessary.

55:55.238 --> 55:57.504
Thank you.
That's very understanding.

55:57.607 --> 55:59.384
Are you kidding? It's the best
thing that ever happened to me.

55:59.408 --> 56:01.242
Since then, I've got
my morning business back,

56:01.344 --> 56:04.411
plus yours, not to mention
the mayor's daughter's sweet 16.

56:06.115 --> 56:07.180
Well, congratulations.

56:07.283 --> 56:08.949
Thank you.
Thank you.

56:09.051 --> 56:13.053
And I'll take a cupcake.

56:15.958 --> 56:18.058
- Thanks.
- That'll be five bucks.

56:18.160 --> 56:19.160
Five bucks?

56:19.194 --> 56:21.928
All in the spirit
of competition.

56:25.501 --> 56:31.138
Sure.
There you go.

56:31.240 --> 56:34.808
Thank you.

56:34.910 --> 56:38.245
Would you like
a little more coffee?

56:44.287 --> 56:45.786
Hey.

56:45.888 --> 56:47.421
Hey, thank you so much
for doing this.

56:47.523 --> 56:49.089
- No problem.
- Appreciate it.

57:23.525 --> 57:24.591
Janet.

57:24.693 --> 57:25.592
I still can't believe

57:25.694 --> 57:26.934
that you let him back in there.

57:27.029 --> 57:28.029
Well, he's got help.

57:28.097 --> 57:30.731
Harley owns the hardware store.

57:30.833 --> 57:32.633
Great.
Free access to power tools.

57:32.735 --> 57:34.935
They're trying to help.

57:35.037 --> 57:36.648
Look, it's better
than waiting three weeks

57:36.672 --> 57:38.204
to reopen, you know.

57:38.306 --> 57:40.373
I guess.

57:40.475 --> 57:42.175
Anyway, good news.

57:42.277 --> 57:43.376
What?

57:43.478 --> 57:45.245
Channel 8 called back.

57:45.347 --> 57:46.357
They want to do a piece on you.

57:46.381 --> 57:47.280
Are you kidding?

57:47.382 --> 57:48.682
No.

57:48.784 --> 57:50.028
- Isn't that great?
- That's awesome!

57:50.052 --> 57:51.652
Thank you.

57:51.754 --> 57:52.619
- You're welcome.
- Yes.

57:52.721 --> 57:55.522
- My pleasure.
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

58:21.516 --> 58:23.249
Ollie, what are you doing here?

58:23.351 --> 58:26.519
It's Wednesday.

58:28.791 --> 58:31.491
Faster, dad.

58:33.261 --> 58:34.761
All right, Ollie.
Hold on.

58:34.863 --> 58:36.196
- Yeah?
- Slow down, buddy.

58:36.298 --> 58:38.431
Okay.

58:38.533 --> 58:40.701
Ooh-Kay.

58:40.803 --> 58:42.202
I'm tired.

58:42.304 --> 58:44.270
You're getting in shape, buddy.

58:44.372 --> 58:47.674
Thanks. It's all
because of your routines.

58:52.447 --> 58:54.781
You're going back, aren't you?

58:54.883 --> 58:57.650
When your mom lets me.

58:57.753 --> 59:00.420
I mean, back to the base.

59:00.522 --> 59:03.123
You're not retiring, are you?

59:03.225 --> 59:07.828
Well, nothing's
been decided yet.

59:07.930 --> 59:12.232
I know I messed up really badly,

59:12.334 --> 59:17.503
but I'll do my very best
to make things better, okay?

59:17.606 --> 59:20.774
And then you'll leave?

59:42.631 --> 59:43.930
- That's cool.
- Right?

59:44.032 --> 59:47.067
'Cause then they all
kind of need the food basically?

59:47.169 --> 59:48.169
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:48.270 --> 59:49.903
What are you doing here?

59:50.005 --> 59:52.806
I'm here with Ray.

59:52.908 --> 59:53.974
You like this bakery, Ray?

59:54.076 --> 59:55.809
No, sir.
I never come here.

59:55.911 --> 59:57.811
- But you're here now.
- I just needed bread.

59:57.913 --> 01:00:00.647
- The market sells bread.
- It's day-old bread.

01:00:00.749 --> 01:00:02.293
You're feeding my daughter
day-old bread, Ray?

01:00:02.317 --> 01:00:04.484
It's for the halfway house.

01:00:04.586 --> 01:00:05.752
You an addict?

01:00:05.854 --> 01:00:08.621
I volunteer there, sir.

01:00:08.723 --> 01:00:13.726
Well, then, in that case,

01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:16.429
why don't you get them
some fresh bread?

01:00:20.502 --> 01:00:25.438
Thank you, Mr. Carson...
Colonel, sir.

01:00:27.742 --> 01:00:29.575
Thanks, dad.

01:00:48.864 --> 01:00:51.564
We're not finished yet.

01:00:53.401 --> 01:00:55.235
Yeah, I can see that.

01:00:55.337 --> 01:00:57.470
I know it doesn't look like it,

01:00:57.572 --> 01:00:59.906
but Harley says that you
can reopen this weekend.

01:01:01.276 --> 01:01:03.710
And if you need anybody
to help, you know,

01:01:03.812 --> 01:01:06.980
fill in until you can find
a replacement for Sheila,

01:01:07.082 --> 01:01:08.715
I'd be happy to help.

01:01:08.817 --> 01:01:11.718
Thanks, but I don't think so.

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:13.720
Of course.

01:01:17.893 --> 01:01:19.759
What?

01:01:21.429 --> 01:01:24.664
I was just thinking that...

01:01:24.766 --> 01:01:26.166
you want us to stop?

01:01:26.268 --> 01:01:28.034
Pine.

01:01:28.136 --> 01:01:29.669
Pine?

01:01:29.771 --> 01:01:31.738
Yeah, I never really liked

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:37.443
these old Formica countertops
and...

01:01:37.545 --> 01:01:40.146
Do you think you guys
could put in pine?

01:01:40.249 --> 01:01:42.548
Yeah. Sure.

01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:45.618
Thanks.

01:01:48.156 --> 01:01:51.457
So have you heard anything
from the review board?

01:01:51.559 --> 01:01:54.394
No, no, not yet.

01:01:54.496 --> 01:01:57.264
You look...
you look really great.

01:01:57.366 --> 01:01:59.032
Thanks.

01:01:59.134 --> 01:02:03.937
I ran into Kim and the arm,

01:02:04.039 --> 01:02:05.705
you know, what's his name?
Ray.

01:02:05.807 --> 01:02:08.841
They seem like they're getting
pretty serious.

01:02:08.944 --> 01:02:11.544
No more than us at that age.

01:02:11.646 --> 01:02:13.646
Yeah, but we were
more responsible, right?

01:02:13.748 --> 01:02:15.548
Probably not.

01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:18.518
Well, 'cause it really seemed
like we were.

01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:20.820
Yeah.

01:02:20.923 --> 01:02:24.391
I got to go, so...

01:02:36.418 --> 01:02:38.852
Janet, how did you get
the idea for four star bakery?

01:02:38.954 --> 01:02:40.887
Well, my husband's
in the military,

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:43.090
and my kids are in school.

01:02:43.191 --> 01:02:46.026
And I just felt
like I was always waiting

01:02:46.128 --> 01:02:47.761
for the ones that I loved
to come home.

01:02:47.863 --> 01:02:52.032
So I felt like I needed
to create a new role for myself.

01:02:52.134 --> 01:02:54.300
Cupcakes are so hot right now.

01:02:54.402 --> 01:02:55.301
Why do you think that is?

01:02:55.403 --> 01:02:57.137
Well... yes.

01:02:57.239 --> 01:02:58.839
- Here's my cupcakes.
- Hi.

01:02:58.941 --> 01:03:00.240
Someone once told me

01:03:00.342 --> 01:03:03.810
that you can't look at a cupcake
without smiling, so...

01:03:03.912 --> 01:03:05.746
Well, I know that I'm smiling.

01:03:05.848 --> 01:03:08.081
- Aw.
- And that's the news.

01:03:08.183 --> 01:03:12.152
Thanks, Kayla.
Those really look good. Now...

01:04:07.976 --> 01:04:10.411
Come on.

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:11.678
Looking good.

01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:13.881
- Come on, guys.
- Watch out for the squeeze.

01:04:13.982 --> 01:04:15.260
Watch out
for the squeeze play, guys.

01:04:15.284 --> 01:04:16.650
- All right.
- That's okay.

01:04:16.752 --> 01:04:18.151
That's all right.
We'll get two.

01:04:18.253 --> 01:04:19.286
We'll get two next time.

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:20.754
Come on, man.

01:04:20.856 --> 01:04:22.255
- Let's go, dragons.
- That's it.

01:04:22.357 --> 01:04:25.125
Hey, I didn't know
you had a kid on the dragons.

01:04:25.227 --> 01:04:27.027
I don't.
He's on the other team.

01:04:27.129 --> 01:04:28.328
Strike one.

01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:31.064
- We're in first place.
- Nice.

01:04:31.166 --> 01:04:33.333
That's okay, you know
what the strike looks like now.

01:04:36.338 --> 01:04:37.471
So cupcakes, huh?

01:04:37.573 --> 01:04:39.105
That's right.

01:04:39.207 --> 01:04:41.041
You got it.
You got it.

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:42.509
Sheila's?

01:04:42.611 --> 01:04:44.812
Mine.

01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:50.150
Sheila won't make cupcakes
for me.

01:04:50.252 --> 01:04:53.754
Listen, I'm going to be reopening
next week at 11:00 a.m.

01:04:53.856 --> 01:04:55.867
I thought maybe we could go back
to our original agreement.

01:04:55.891 --> 01:04:57.758
You can open whenever you want,

01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:00.260
but I'm going to continue
to make my cupcakes.

01:05:00.362 --> 01:05:04.598
As your husband says,
it's in the spirit of competition.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.867
Right.

01:05:06.969 --> 01:05:09.937
- Mind if I squeeze in here?
- Oh, please do.

01:05:13.776 --> 01:05:15.943
- That's okay.
- These look amazing.

01:05:16.045 --> 01:05:18.045
Oh, well, thank you.
You know what they say,

01:05:18.147 --> 01:05:21.282
you can't even look at a cupcake
without smiling.

01:05:21.384 --> 01:05:23.451
You saw that?

01:05:23.553 --> 01:05:25.052
Yes, I did.
It was great.

01:05:27.156 --> 01:05:29.090
- So who made these?
- I did.

01:05:29.192 --> 01:05:31.758
Really, who made them?

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:34.395
Me. I was up
most of the night baking.

01:05:34.497 --> 01:05:36.130
I can't believe you made these.

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:38.532
I can never get
the camouflage right.

01:05:38.634 --> 01:05:40.234
Well, camouflage
is kind of a guy thing.

01:05:40.336 --> 01:05:43.804
Although I wouldn't really
know that any more.

01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:51.178
You know, he asked her
to the prom.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.215
- Fantastic.
- He's a good kid.

01:05:54.317 --> 01:05:57.384
I know. It's just
she's our little girl.

01:05:57.487 --> 01:05:59.987
Yeah, I know.
I have a hard time too.

01:06:00.089 --> 01:06:01.589
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:03.790
And she's going
to be off to college soon.

01:06:03.892 --> 01:06:07.161
And then Ollie and...

01:06:07.263 --> 01:06:08.940
I think that's why my business
is so important,

01:06:08.964 --> 01:06:10.342
because you're all going
to be gone,

01:06:10.366 --> 01:06:12.899
and I'm just going to disappear,
you know.

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:15.302
Why would you ever think that?

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:17.438
Because I'm a 40-year-old mom
and wife,

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.100
and where am I going
to be in ten years?

01:06:19.175 --> 01:06:22.576
50.

01:06:22.678 --> 01:06:24.145
No, I'm going to be alone,
Griff.

01:06:24.247 --> 01:06:29.082
You're going to be General,
and they'll be gone.

01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:31.084
It's the bottom of the ninth,

01:06:31.187 --> 01:06:34.288
and the tigers and dragons
are tied, one to one.

01:06:36.259 --> 01:06:40.628
Next up for the dragons,
number 11, Oliver Carson.

01:06:40.729 --> 01:06:42.829
- Come on!
- Yeah! Whoo!

01:06:42.931 --> 01:06:44.498
Let's go, Ollie.
Come on, buddy.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.267
- Go, Ollie.
- Let's go, Ollie.

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:47.535
Go, Ollie!

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:48.669
Come on, Ollie.

01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:50.371
Come on!

01:07:05.754 --> 01:07:08.189
You got it, bud.

01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:10.257
Ooh, this is big.

01:07:14.797 --> 01:07:16.930
Strike one.

01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:18.932
It's all right.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:27.341
Let's go, buddy.

01:07:30.879 --> 01:07:32.446
Strike two.

01:07:33.782 --> 01:07:35.782
It's okay, Ollie.
It's okay, buddy.

01:07:35.884 --> 01:07:37.484
Here we go, bud.

01:07:43.058 --> 01:07:47.127
Let's go, Ollie, let's go!

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:49.263
Let's go, Ollie, let's go!

01:07:49.365 --> 01:07:50.805
Come on, buddy, come on now.
Come on.

01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:57.671
Come on, let's go, dragons.

01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:17.524
- Yes!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

01:08:28.036 --> 01:08:29.102
Safe.

01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:34.241
And the dragons win, two to one,

01:08:34.344 --> 01:08:36.810
on Oliver Carson's
one-run homer.

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:39.912
Way to go.
That was awesome. No way.

01:08:40.015 --> 01:08:41.582
- So good.
- Oh, ho!

01:08:41.684 --> 01:08:43.817
Let's have a big round
of applause

01:08:43.919 --> 01:08:45.519
for our division two tigers.

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:47.421
Great job, fellas.
Great season.

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:48.667
- That was amazing.
- Fantastic.

01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:49.835
He just...
he leapt right over the guy.

01:08:52.428 --> 01:08:53.926
Hi.

01:08:59.202 --> 01:09:01.969
Honey, I don't know if I've
ever actually ever said this

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:05.738
to you out loud,
but I'm really proud of you.

01:09:07.343 --> 01:09:09.910
Thank you.

01:09:19.389 --> 01:09:21.354
Come here.
Are you kidding me?

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:24.358
That was incredible.
That was fantastic, buddy!

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:26.327
All that hard work paid off!

01:09:26.429 --> 01:09:27.828
You just... vroom.

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.397
Hey, we should all celebrate,
okay?

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:32.166
We should go over
and get some burgers at angel's.

01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:33.734
That's still the place, right?

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:37.804
Angel's is no longer
in business.

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:39.340
And the team's taking me
to pizza.

01:09:39.442 --> 01:09:41.642
But thanks for the offer.

01:09:41.743 --> 01:09:44.912
- Yeah.
- Bye, guys. Love you.

01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:49.917
And I got to meet Thad
at the new store. I'm sorry.

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:52.420
No. No worries.
We'll do it another time.

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:55.523
Yeah.
Okay.

01:09:58.627 --> 01:10:02.963
So you got turned down
by everybody else?

01:10:03.066 --> 01:10:04.998
Where's Ray and his arm?

01:10:05.101 --> 01:10:07.068
He's resting his arm up
for our date later.

01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:10.771
He's gonna be resting it
in a cast if he's not careful.

01:10:13.477 --> 01:10:15.243
- Look at that.
- That's great.

01:10:15.345 --> 01:10:17.646
That's nice.
Harley, thank you so much.

01:10:17.748 --> 01:10:20.815
You're welcome, man.
We did it.

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:22.717
The place looks fantastic.

01:10:22.819 --> 01:10:24.179
Hey, listen,
I'm going to take off.

01:10:24.254 --> 01:10:25.265
Are you coming over tonight?

01:10:25.289 --> 01:10:26.588
Yeah. Yeah.
I'll be there.

01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:27.933
I just want to make
this place perfect.

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:29.269
I have a few
little finishing touches.

01:10:29.293 --> 01:10:30.958
You go for it, man.
I'll see you later.

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.661
Yeah. Thanks.

01:10:56.186 --> 01:10:58.052
Okay. Make this quick.

01:10:58.154 --> 01:11:00.021
Fine.

01:11:00.123 --> 01:11:01.456
His cupcakes suck.

01:11:01.558 --> 01:11:03.591
You know it, I know it.

01:11:03.694 --> 01:11:05.026
What's your point?

01:11:05.128 --> 01:11:07.995
I know you don't like me,
but this is not about me.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:09.664
This is about Janet.

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:15.069
Just tell me what it would take
to get you to come back.

01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:18.873
You buy me a new icing gun.

01:11:18.975 --> 01:11:20.308
Done.

01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:23.945
And you apologize.

01:11:24.047 --> 01:11:26.080
On your knees.

01:11:26.182 --> 01:11:28.149
That last one might be
a bit of a problem.

01:11:28.251 --> 01:11:29.917
You want me to come back?

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:34.689
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.100
I'm waiting.

01:11:47.471 --> 01:11:51.740
Sheila, I apologize for anything

01:11:51.842 --> 01:11:55.243
that I have ever said
or done that offended you.

01:11:55.345 --> 01:12:01.816
I am very sorry, I apologize,
and will you please come back?

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:10.992
All right.

01:12:12.429 --> 01:12:15.530
All right.
All right.

01:12:15.632 --> 01:12:17.665
I don't suppose
there's any chance

01:12:17.768 --> 01:12:19.634
that you might erase that?

01:12:19.736 --> 01:12:23.371
Not a chance.

01:12:23.473 --> 01:12:28.443
And, for the record,
I don't dislike you any more

01:12:28.545 --> 01:12:30.512
than I dislike anybody else.

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:40.655
18th to... yeah.

01:12:40.757 --> 01:12:45.126
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:12:45.228 --> 01:12:46.494
We should celebrate.

01:12:46.596 --> 01:12:48.630
You know?

01:12:51.034 --> 01:12:53.267
There you go.

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:56.237
To...

01:12:56.339 --> 01:12:58.973
New beginnings.

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:06.380
What's wrong?

01:13:06.483 --> 01:13:07.660
Come on,
we worked hard for this.

01:13:07.684 --> 01:13:09.717
I just never thought

01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:13.955
I'd celebrate anything
without Griff.

01:13:14.057 --> 01:13:15.957
Well, he's got himself to blame.

01:13:16.059 --> 01:13:20.628
Just never made
any room for him.

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:23.631
I just expected him
to fit into our lives,

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:27.969
and I've been so busy

01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:31.940
building all of this
apart from him.

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:34.141
Well, you've grown,
and he hasn't.

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:36.845
You know, I hate to be the one
to say this,

01:13:36.947 --> 01:13:38.680
but what do you guys
have in common anymore?

01:13:45.188 --> 01:13:46.855
Whoa!
What are you doing?

01:13:48.525 --> 01:13:50.205
You have to know how attracted
I am to you.

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.537
I mean, what do you think
we're doing here?

01:13:51.561 --> 01:13:52.827
Working.

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:55.697
Come on.
You don't have to feel guilty.

01:13:55.799 --> 01:14:00.134
No.

01:15:01.742 --> 01:15:02.641
Hello?

01:15:02.743 --> 01:15:03.776
Are you awake?

01:15:03.878 --> 01:15:06.045
I was just about to call you.

01:15:07.448 --> 01:15:09.315
I was wondering if you wanted

01:15:09.417 --> 01:15:13.920
to come with me
to Harley's party tomorrow.

01:15:19.794 --> 01:15:21.694
Welcome to the Oaks.

01:15:24.165 --> 01:15:25.664
Thanks.

01:15:25.766 --> 01:15:28.767
Thank you very much.

01:15:31.139 --> 01:15:34.073
You did all this?

01:15:34.175 --> 01:15:36.775
Well, you know,
Harley's been a good friend.

01:15:36.878 --> 01:15:38.398
And this is kind of a big deal
for him.

01:15:38.479 --> 01:15:40.412
He brought somebody.

01:15:40.514 --> 01:15:41.948
Yeah.

01:15:42.050 --> 01:15:43.615
Hey, there's Harley.

01:15:43.718 --> 01:15:44.616
Harley, happy birthday, buddy.

01:15:44.719 --> 01:15:47.553
Hey, Carson.

01:15:47.655 --> 01:15:49.521
All right.
Take it easy.

01:15:49.623 --> 01:15:50.689
Hi, Harley.
Happy birthday.

01:15:50.791 --> 01:15:52.358
Janet. Thank you.
You look beautiful.

01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:53.804
- Thank you.
- Hey, listen, listen, listen.

01:15:53.828 --> 01:15:56.795
I got to... I got to... I got
to introduce you to my gal.

01:15:56.898 --> 01:15:58.530
Okay.

01:15:58.632 --> 01:15:59.866
He's very excited.

01:15:59.968 --> 01:16:02.101
Yeah.

01:16:02.203 --> 01:16:05.137
- Hi.
- This is Paula.

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:06.605
Hi.
It's nice to see you again.

01:16:06.707 --> 01:16:08.707
And Carson.

01:16:08.809 --> 01:16:11.177
Hi. Nice to meet you
officially.

01:16:11.279 --> 01:16:12.411
Ray's mom.

01:16:12.513 --> 01:16:14.113
- Yes, ma'am.
- Nice to see you.

01:16:16.217 --> 01:16:17.416
- Hey, mama.
- Hi.

01:16:17.518 --> 01:16:20.086
Harley, happy birthday, man.

01:16:20.188 --> 01:16:21.820
- Hey, thank you very much.
- Hi.

01:16:21.923 --> 01:16:22.955
- Mrs. Carson.
- Yeah.

01:16:23.057 --> 01:16:24.490
- You look very nice.
- Thank you.

01:16:24.592 --> 01:16:26.625
Sir.

01:16:26.727 --> 01:16:28.172
Yeah, I used to have
to call him "sir" myself.

01:16:28.196 --> 01:16:29.828
Let's go. Come on.

01:16:29.931 --> 01:16:31.041
- Okay.
- Let's have a drink.

01:16:31.065 --> 01:16:32.731
Okay.
That sounds good.

01:16:32.833 --> 01:16:33.866
May I get that?

01:16:33.968 --> 01:16:34.968
Sure.

01:16:37.672 --> 01:16:38.771
I haven't eaten all day.

01:16:38.874 --> 01:16:40.206
Let me... I have got to go.

01:16:40.308 --> 01:16:43.810
Ladies. Ladies.

01:16:43.912 --> 01:16:46.012
Just go easy
on the shrimp, please.

01:16:46.114 --> 01:16:47.313
Oh, you.

01:16:47.415 --> 01:16:48.615
You kidder, Mr. Handsome.

01:16:48.717 --> 01:16:50.717
- He's such a silly boy.
- Look at you.

01:16:50.819 --> 01:16:52.485
Look at you.
You guys look fantastic.

01:16:52.587 --> 01:16:54.098
- Well, thank you, Carson.
- Thank you.

01:16:54.122 --> 01:16:57.223
I... I am very sorry.
I apologize.

01:16:57.325 --> 01:16:59.926
Oh, no.

01:17:00.028 --> 01:17:01.528
See, he gets on his knees.

01:17:01.630 --> 01:17:04.230
I can't believe he actually
went down on his knees.

01:17:04.332 --> 01:17:08.535
Ooh. Not at all.
Yeah.

01:17:08.637 --> 01:17:10.336
What's going on over there?

01:17:10.438 --> 01:17:11.337
You're not gonna like it.

01:17:11.439 --> 01:17:12.872
What, you've seen it?

01:17:12.974 --> 01:17:15.074
It's all over the Internet.

01:17:15.176 --> 01:17:16.375
Excuse me.

01:17:19.313 --> 01:17:21.180
I so needed this.
I so needed this.

01:17:21.282 --> 01:17:22.515
Well, excuse me.

01:17:22.617 --> 01:17:24.457
Apologize for anything
that I have ever said...

01:17:27.488 --> 01:17:30.389
It was a tactical retreat.

01:17:30.491 --> 01:17:32.592
Your cupcake rack.

01:17:32.694 --> 01:17:35.962
Will you please come back?

01:17:36.064 --> 01:17:39.899
Hey, kids,
what are you doing here?

01:17:40.001 --> 01:17:41.701
Well, we heard
there's free food.

01:17:41.803 --> 01:17:44.470
We raised 'em well.

01:17:46.007 --> 01:17:47.306
You should check out the view.

01:17:47.408 --> 01:17:49.241
You oldies
like that kind of thing, right?

01:17:49.343 --> 01:17:54.647
Yes, we oldies
like that kind of thing.

01:17:56.117 --> 01:17:58.117
Okay?

01:18:28.817 --> 01:18:32.685
Does this mean
I get my couch back?

01:18:41.763 --> 01:18:45.898
I've fought a lot of battles,

01:18:46.001 --> 01:18:49.301
but never one quite like this.

01:18:54.208 --> 01:18:58.277
All I really wanna say

01:18:58.379 --> 01:19:01.981
is that I love you...

01:19:03.752 --> 01:19:05.885
And I can't lose you.

01:19:09.524 --> 01:19:12.925
You've made me the man
that I am.

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:23.670
I never gave you much
of a wedding 18 years ago,

01:19:23.772 --> 01:19:26.005
and I hope it isn't too late.

01:19:30.578 --> 01:19:33.746
No, it's not too late.

01:20:20.429 --> 01:20:22.963
Sheila is fighting
with the supplier again.

01:20:23.065 --> 01:20:24.242
Are you sure it was
a good idea to hire her

01:20:24.266 --> 01:20:25.332
to run the other store?

01:20:25.434 --> 01:20:27.467
People seem to like her.

01:20:27.569 --> 01:20:29.236
How is that even possible?
Thank you.

01:20:29.338 --> 01:20:30.470
I don't know.

01:20:30.572 --> 01:20:31.839
- Honey.
- Here you go, sir.

01:20:31.941 --> 01:20:33.618
Honey, can you grab this?
I'm buzzing right here.

01:20:33.642 --> 01:20:35.308
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Thank you.

01:20:37.113 --> 01:20:38.712
Carson's phone, this is Janet.

01:20:38.814 --> 01:20:40.114
Janet, it's General brown.

01:20:40.216 --> 01:20:42.116
Is Carson available?

01:20:42.218 --> 01:20:44.284
Yes, he's here...
of course, he's right here.

01:20:44.386 --> 01:20:45.853
Hold on.

01:20:45.955 --> 01:20:49.589
It's the General.

01:20:49.691 --> 01:20:52.993
Afternoon, General.

01:20:58.033 --> 01:21:00.033
Yes, sir.

01:21:03.572 --> 01:21:07.274
So what'd he say?

01:21:07.376 --> 01:21:08.776
I made brigadier General.

01:21:08.878 --> 01:21:11.578
Of course you did.

01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:13.346
Oh, my gosh.

01:21:13.448 --> 01:21:15.649
I am so proud of you.

01:21:15.751 --> 01:21:18.485
So proud of you.

01:21:18.587 --> 01:21:20.620
That's great.

01:21:22.624 --> 01:21:24.524
So how much time do we have?

01:21:24.626 --> 01:21:28.361
- Today.
- Today.

01:21:52.021 --> 01:21:55.155
You're a different man
than the one that came home.

01:22:06.268 --> 01:22:09.069
We're gonna miss you so much.

01:22:09.171 --> 01:22:12.840
I don't think so.

01:22:12.942 --> 01:22:15.508
What?

01:22:15.610 --> 01:22:17.177
I turned down the commission.

01:22:17.279 --> 01:22:18.912
I'm not going anywhere.

01:22:19.014 --> 01:22:20.625
I'm gonna see you guys
every single day...

01:22:20.649 --> 01:22:22.049
- What?
- For the rest of your life.

01:22:22.084 --> 01:22:23.851
- Oh, my gosh.
- That's so awesome.

01:22:23.953 --> 01:22:25.886
I love you.

01:22:25.988 --> 01:22:27.821
- I love you.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:22:27.923 --> 01:22:29.489
That's incredible.

01:22:29.591 --> 01:22:31.091
Let somebody else be
a General, okay?

01:22:31.193 --> 01:22:33.593
I wanna be an enlisted man
right here at home.

01:22:34.964 --> 01:22:36.964
Awesome.

01:22:38.467 --> 01:22:39.532
There he is.

01:22:39.634 --> 01:22:41.701
Hey, Harley.

01:22:41.803 --> 01:22:43.670
All right. I'm taking everybody
on a picnic.

01:22:43.772 --> 01:22:45.272
- Let's go.
- Really?

01:22:45.374 --> 01:22:46.606
Ollie, get the door.

01:22:46.708 --> 01:22:48.519
I got all the picnic supplies
right in here, come on.

01:22:48.543 --> 01:22:49.721
Harley, can I drive?
Please, please, please.

01:22:49.745 --> 01:22:51.078
- Thank you.
- Oh, my god.

01:22:52.882 --> 01:22:54.781
I'm in shock.

01:22:54.884 --> 01:22:55.884
Hurry up, Ollie.

01:22:55.985 --> 01:22:59.319
Okay, come on.

01:22:59.421 --> 01:23:01.454
Thank you, buddy.

01:23:04.994 --> 01:23:06.171
Everybody have
their seat belts on?

01:23:06.195 --> 01:23:07.261
Go, go, go, go.

01:23:07.363 --> 01:23:08.962
- Yup. Great.
- Got my seat belt.

01:23:09.064 --> 01:23:10.330
I got it.

01:23:10.432 --> 01:23:12.565
Relax, honey.

01:23:12.667 --> 01:23:15.735
Just take it easy.
Give it a little bit of gas.

01:23:15.837 --> 01:23:17.104
There you go.

01:23:17.206 --> 01:23:20.774
Okay, now, just keep going
straight down for three blocks...
