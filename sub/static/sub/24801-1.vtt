Now is not the time to
negotiate, you'll understand.

01:14:17.645 --> 01:14:19.279
There's a good boy.

01:14:19.281 --> 01:14:21.646
Let him go now, mate.

01:14:21.648 --> 01:14:23.280
Release him now,
Marlowe. Come on.

01:14:23.282 --> 01:14:28.351
I think we know how
this plays out, lads, don't we?

01:14:28.353 --> 01:14:30.253
Anil?

01:14:30.255 --> 01:14:32.219
Please.

01:14:32.221 --> 01:14:33.154
Just take the gun
away from his head!

01:14:33.156 --> 01:14:36.121
Why are you
always running to his rescue?

01:14:36.123 --> 01:14:40.292
He's the one that
fucks everything up.

01:14:40.294 --> 01:14:43.660
You can't fix it,
Solomon. Not this time.

01:14:43.662 --> 01:14:45.927
You're the one pointing a
gun at a seven year old boy.

01:14:45.929 --> 01:14:47.061
You coward!

01:14:47.063 --> 01:14:51.731
I'm no liar! I don't run.

01:14:51.733 --> 01:14:55.665
You think I can run from this?

01:14:55.667 --> 01:14:58.668
When you do something,
you stand up like a man.

01:14:58.670 --> 01:15:03.304
You take your punishment.

01:15:03.306 --> 01:15:07.876
You fucked up everybody's
life. Do you not know that?

01:15:10.978 --> 01:15:17.011
[LOW RUMBLING AMBIENCE]

01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:51.966
See you soon, brother.

01:16:15.715 --> 01:16:23.718
You can't joke a joker.

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:26.320
Alright, mate!

01:16:26.322 --> 01:16:29.990
Bloody tourists.

01:17:47.903 --> 01:17:54.939
Baby, you stay in the car, okay?
You don't go anywhere.

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:03.210
Get out of the car.

01:18:03.212 --> 01:18:07.715
After all the trouble you've
caused me, I've earned this.

01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:20.219
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to run off.

01:18:20.221 --> 01:18:26.290
Alright. It's
madness. And I wanted to say,

01:18:26.292 --> 01:18:30.527
I've been trying to say that...

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:43.602
Maybe in the next life.

01:18:43.604 --> 01:18:47.138
[BIRDS CHIRPING]

01:19:40.269 --> 01:19:50.072
What you did back there, your
brother would have been proud.

01:20:01.050 --> 01:20:04.083
MIKE:
This is home.

01:20:08.987 --> 01:20:14.254
SOL: So, what, you're
just gonna stay here?

01:20:14.256 --> 01:20:16.489
MIKE:
Yeah.

01:20:25.964 --> 01:20:29.297
SOL:
Good luck, Mike.

01:20:29.299 --> 01:20:31.998
MIKE:
Wait.

01:20:34.868 --> 01:20:37.670
Merry Christmas.

01:20:47.643 --> 01:20:50.943
I'm keeping your deposit.

01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:02.249
Is it still Christmas?

01:21:02.251 --> 01:21:07.485
I think it's
Boxing Day, actually.

01:21:07.654 --> 01:21:10.788
How much have we got in the bag?
