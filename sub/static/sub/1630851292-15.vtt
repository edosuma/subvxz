11:20.922 --> 11:22.347
I can't sleep. I can't eat.

11:22.574 --> 11:24.866
Peyton Manning was accused
of assaulting a woman...

11:24.926 --> 11:26.409
and it just kind of went away.

11:26.428 --> 11:28.094
I need you to do something
for me, Peter.

11:28.246 --> 11:29.503
What is it? You name it.

11:29.597 --> 11:31.856
I don't want to live like this.
I need...

11:32.025 --> 11:33.841
I need you to kill me.

11:34.010 --> 11:35.601
What?! Quagmire,
I can't do that.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.344
You're-you're my best friend.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.197
If that's true,
then you'll... do it.

11:39.348 --> 11:41.090
You don't know
what it's been like.

11:41.109 --> 11:44.260
I can't remember the last time
I slept... 15 minutes straight.

11:44.279 --> 11:46.871
It's torture, Peter...
and it's driving me insane!

11:47.098 --> 11:49.499
Please... I'm begging you.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.770
(hiccups)

11:53.863 --> 11:55.380
Well, if it's really come
to that,

11:55.607 --> 11:58.532
if that's what you really want,
I'll do it.

11:58.552 --> 12:01.294
Oh, thank you, Peter.
And you have to do it.

12:01.463 --> 12:04.113
You can't let me out of it,
no matter how much I insist.

12:04.207 --> 12:05.873
It's done.
I'll come get you tomorrow.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.134
Thank you, Peter...
thank you so much.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.894
What are you doing
with your Hawaiian shirts?

12:10.121 --> 12:11.712
I want them tightly folded

12:11.806 --> 12:13.973
like a flag
at a military funeral.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.317
(playing "Aloha 'Oe")

12:20.073 --> 12:23.466
There's a condom in the pocket.
And it's used.

12:23.559 --> 12:26.469
(sobbing)

12:26.562 --> 12:30.582
Who else but Quagmire?

12:35.830 --> 12:38.982
Burn. Why aren't you burning?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.741
-(calypso music playing)
-Uh, Black Irish, Chris.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.485
I never burn, only tan.

12:42.578 --> 12:46.139
Uh, hey, Kel, how's
that cocktail coming along?

12:50.771 --> 12:53.104
Listen, Meg, I've got a big job
I've been thinking about.

12:53.256 --> 12:55.665
-I'm talking huge.
-You're not...

12:55.758 --> 12:57.667
You're not seriously thinking
about robbing

12:57.760 --> 12:59.352
-Ross Dress for Less.
-Ross Dress for Less. Exactly.

12:59.504 --> 13:01.838
It's their Memorial Day sale
this weekend.

13:01.931 --> 13:03.597
-Big job.
-Big savings.

13:03.766 --> 13:05.766
That's Ross Dress for Less.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.768
Gonna need a hell of a driver.

13:07.788 --> 13:09.679
I knew I could count on you.

13:09.772 --> 13:11.014
What kind is this?

13:11.032 --> 13:12.439
It's French's.

13:12.608 --> 13:15.535
(babbling, slurping)

13:15.687 --> 13:18.797
Oh, my God,
Meg's gonna commit a robbery.

13:18.948 --> 13:20.799
What am I gonna do?

13:21.026 --> 13:23.635
Chris is in distress?

13:23.711 --> 13:26.638
Herbert is in distress?

13:26.714 --> 13:28.640
Old turtle.

13:35.723 --> 13:36.815
Hey, Meg?

13:36.966 --> 13:38.817
I need to talk to you
about something.

13:39.044 --> 13:41.653
About Ross Dress for Less.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.047
What?
How do you know about that?

13:44.065 --> 13:45.398
I heard what you said
in the car.

13:45.567 --> 13:49.143
Meg, I think you're
very confused about something.

13:49.237 --> 13:50.995
Oh, what?
Wait, wait, let me guess.

13:51.222 --> 13:52.980
Seymour's just using me?

13:52.999 --> 13:55.834
Trust me, Chris,
I'm not confused about anything.

13:55.910 --> 13:59.579
-No, Meg...
-Stop spying on me,
you little creep.

13:59.731 --> 14:01.655
Oh, man, I got to tell somebody.

14:01.675 --> 14:06.094
But first, let's have a look
at this sex toy drawer.

14:10.925 --> 14:13.409
Wow, big sex toy.

14:13.428 --> 14:16.688
And big savings. That's Hitachi.

14:19.601 --> 14:21.192
(hiccuping):
Goodbye, baby girl.

14:21.344 --> 14:23.528
Daddy's going away for a while.

14:23.679 --> 14:25.846
Ugh, I can't...

14:25.866 --> 14:28.116
(sobbing, hiccuping)

14:30.778 --> 14:32.353
-(yowls)
-Ow! Ouch!

14:32.372 --> 14:34.706
God, those claws
went right through my pants.

14:34.857 --> 14:36.265
Oh, my God.

14:36.434 --> 14:37.858
Oh, my God, they're gone.

14:37.952 --> 14:40.753
Kitty, you did it!
You broke the curse!

14:45.443 --> 14:46.442
(muffled scream)

14:46.461 --> 14:48.611
(muffled):
Peter, no! They went away.

14:48.613 --> 14:50.221
-My hiccups are gone.
-Oh, no.

14:50.373 --> 14:53.040
That's exactly what you said
not to listen to.

14:53.134 --> 14:54.225
(grunts)
Peter, please!

14:54.377 --> 14:56.377
I swear, they're gone! Listen!

14:56.396 --> 14:58.971
Sorry, Quagmire. I promised
to take you out of your misery.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.881
And when I give my word
on something,

15:00.901 --> 15:01.974
I give it my all.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.402
Like when I guarded
Jeffrey Epstein.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.130
(Russian accent):
We would like to see prisoner.

15:07.148 --> 15:09.407
-On whose authority?
-Your mother.

15:09.634 --> 15:11.576
(sneers)

15:17.809 --> 15:20.901
All right, I was able to hack
into the city's server.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.145
There's an accessible heat duct

15:22.238 --> 15:23.813
on the southwest side
of the building.

15:23.831 --> 15:26.482
If we set off an explosion
here...

15:26.501 --> 15:28.801
Meg, I'm just gonna walk in
and point a gun at the cashier.

15:28.911 --> 15:30.336
Oh. Okay.

15:30.413 --> 15:33.580
Yeah. Yeah,

the timer, either.

in anything I do.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.952
You okay back there, Quagmire?

15:54.028 --> 15:55.027
QUAGMIRE (muffled):
Why do you care

15:55.180 --> 15:56.195
if you're just gonna
kill me anyway?

15:56.289 --> 15:58.957
