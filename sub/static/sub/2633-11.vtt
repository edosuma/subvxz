00:03.753 --> 00:04.795
Hey.

00:04.963 --> 00:06.046
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:06.214 --> 00:07.423
Listen, uh...

00:07.590 --> 00:09.758
You think I have a chance with Janine?

00:09.926 --> 00:11.844
Ugh, we've been through this.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.429
Don't do this to yourself.

00:13.596 --> 00:16.015
She made it clear it isn't
going to happen.

00:16.181 --> 00:19.727
All right, then. I guess I shouldn't
get too excited about the fact...

00:19.936 --> 00:21.520
...that I just kissed her!

00:21.688 --> 00:24.273
- Are you serious?
- That's great!

00:24.441 --> 00:25.899
Yeah, well, we'll see.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.069
You kissed her?

00:29.237 --> 00:32.031
Oh, we kissed it up real nice.

00:32.991 --> 00:34.950
So you kissed. Then what happened?

00:35.160 --> 00:37.953
I came over here to tell you guys.

00:38.621 --> 00:40.873
So she's waiting over
there for you?

00:42.459 --> 00:44.168
Yeah.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.091
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.762
I'm gonna be late
for dance class.

01:36.971 --> 01:38.680
Okay.

01:40.517 --> 01:43.185
- Okay, now I'm really leaving.
- All right.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.520
But can you just...

01:44.687 --> 01:46.897
...just leave your lips?

01:49.067 --> 01:50.901
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:53.404 --> 01:54.905
Have you kissed her yet?

01:56.866 --> 01:58.325
It's awesome!

01:58.535 --> 02:00.035
I could do it forever.

02:00.203 --> 02:04.998
You know what? She kisses better
than my mom cooks.

02:05.166 --> 02:08.669
- I'm so glad you said "cooks."
- Right?

02:09.503 --> 02:13.465
Rachel, you've got to tell
the post office that you've moved.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.843
We still get your bills and stuff.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.555
Oh! Oh! Pottery Barn!
You can throw the rest away.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.765
I'm not your garbage man.

02:23.017 --> 02:25.060
I'm your mailman.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.604
Monica, look.

02:27.772 --> 02:30.649
Here is that table that I ordered. Ah!

02:30.817 --> 02:35.112
- You got it from Pottery Barn?
- Yeah. It's an apothecary table.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.656
Does anyone even know what
an apothecary is?

02:37.824 --> 02:39.575
A pharmacist.

02:40.618 --> 02:42.411
A pharmacist.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.456
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.

02:46.624 --> 02:48.083
I hate Pottery Barn too.

02:48.251 --> 02:51.503
They kicked me out just
because I sat on a bed.

02:51.671 --> 02:54.381
You took off your pants
and got under the sheets.

02:57.218 --> 02:58.385
I was tired.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.222
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?

03:02.390 --> 03:04.433
She hates mass-produced stuff.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.603
She thinks her furniture
should have a story behind it.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.813
This has a story behind it.

03:10.064 --> 03:14.401
They had to ship it all the way
from the White Plains store.

03:16.946 --> 03:19.406
It's got to be one-of-a-kind.

03:19.574 --> 03:23.619
Like that God-awful ceramic fruit
bowl she has on her counter?

03:23.786 --> 03:26.622
Hey! I made that for her.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.791
- You made pottery?
- Yeah.

03:29.959 --> 03:32.878
I made it out of a fruit bowl
I found in the garbage.

03:35.131 --> 03:38.508
If you put that in her apartment,
you'll never hear the end of it.

03:38.676 --> 03:41.261
I'll tell her that it's an antique.

03:41.429 --> 03:43.430
She doesn't have to know
where it came from.

03:43.598 --> 03:46.183
Ah, I love these little drawers.

03:46.351 --> 03:49.436
Oh, look!
It says that it holds 300 CDs.

03:49.604 --> 03:52.898
Ah, just like the apothecary tables
of yore.

03:59.739 --> 04:00.989
So the farmer says:

04:01.157 --> 04:02.991
"That's not a cow,
and you're not milking."

04:06.079 --> 04:07.913
I'm so glad you're together.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.416
We wanted a couple to go out with
and now we have one.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.502
We're a couple of couples.

04:14.671 --> 04:17.547
I had so much fun tonight.
What a great restaurant!

04:17.714 --> 04:21.927
And Chandler, I can't believe
I let you pay for this one.

04:24.472 --> 04:25.681
Thanks again, man.

04:26.891 --> 04:30.060
If you come over tomorrow,
I'll make pasta.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.645
- That'd be great!
- Okay.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.314
But at least let us
bring the wine.

04:34.482 --> 04:37.818
- You don't have to.
- Ah, I insist.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.614
- You'll get the wine, right?
- Yeah.

04:44.742 --> 04:47.244
- Okay, good night.
- See you tomorrow.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.121
Can't wait.

04:53.543 --> 04:56.670
How are we going to get
out of that one?

05:00.049 --> 05:02.843
- What?
- I can't handle two nights in a row...

05:03.011 --> 05:04.636
...with them.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.180
What's wrong with them?

05:07.348 --> 05:08.974
They're just a little...

05:09.142 --> 05:10.600
...blah!

05:11.894 --> 05:13.228
Blah?

05:13.938 --> 05:17.524
Well, you know, he's blah.
She's just...

05:17.692 --> 05:20.485
She's very loud for such
a small person.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.116
Uh, they're my best friends.

05:26.284 --> 05:30.037
Are you saying we can't go out?
'Cause that'd be a problem.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.331
Of course we can still
hang out with them.

05:32.498 --> 05:35.208
Just not two nights in a row.

05:37.003 --> 05:40.255
- Okay?
- I guess.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.132
Thank you.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.638
I'll sell my friends and use
the money to buy you presents.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.730
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:56.939 --> 06:01.693
Ooh! What a great table!
Where did you get it?

06:01.861 --> 06:03.070
Guess.

06:03.654 --> 06:06.448
Um, a flea market?

06:06.657 --> 06:10.827
Ha, I knew you would get it
on the first guess.

06:10.995 --> 06:13.163
Isn't it cool?
It's an apothecary table.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.290
Ah, wow.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.585
You can just imagine
that this is where...

06:18.753 --> 06:21.088
...they kept all their stuff
to make potions.

06:21.255 --> 06:22.297
- You know?
- Ooh, yes.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.842
Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.887
Almost.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.389
Oh, how much was it?

06:30.556 --> 06:32.265
Just only 500 bucks.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.101
500 bucks at a flea market?

06:34.310 --> 06:37.938
I thought you meant how much was it...

06:38.106 --> 06:40.023
...when it was new, back then.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.483
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, no.

06:41.651 --> 06:44.694
It was at a flea market,
so it was like a dollar.

06:46.531 --> 06:49.408
- A dollar?
- And fifty?

06:49.575 --> 06:52.244
So it was like
one and fifty dollars.

06:52.412 --> 06:56.081
- They gave you the old-time pricing.
- Yeah.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.167
Well, what period is it from?

06:59.335 --> 07:00.961
Uh, it's from yore.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.380
Like, the "days of yore," you know?

07:03.589 --> 07:05.757
Yes. Yes, I do.

07:05.925 --> 07:09.219
- It's just perfect.
- Oh, good.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.596
I bet it has a great story too.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.890
Did they tell you
where it's from or...

07:14.058 --> 07:16.935
Yes, that I know.
This is from, uh, White Plains.

07:19.188 --> 07:20.522
- White Plains.
- Mm-hm.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.608
Ooh, it sounds like
such a magical place.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.240
- I'm here.
- Hi!

07:32.034 --> 07:33.326
Oh, my God!

07:33.494 --> 07:35.287
- You like it?
- Oh, my God!

07:35.455 --> 07:38.165
It's my new apothecary table!

07:38.916 --> 07:41.626
Phoebe'll be here any second.
She can't see this.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.504
Why not? She'll love it.
It's the real thing.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.465
I got it at Pottery Barn.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.509
I know. I bought the same one.

07:49.677 --> 07:52.304
And if she sees your table,
she'll know I lied.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.390
- I said ours was an original.
- Why?

07:55.558 --> 07:57.559
Because she hates Pottery Barn.

07:57.727 --> 08:01.104
She hates Pottery Barn?

08:01.856 --> 08:03.857
She says it's all mass-produced...

08:04.025 --> 08:07.360
...nothing is authentic, and everyone
winds up having the same stuff.

08:10.823 --> 08:13.742
So come on!
Can we cover this up, please?

08:13.910 --> 08:15.035
What? No, no.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.454
I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.332
Although I did get some great
Pottery Barn sheets.

08:21.709 --> 08:24.377
Ooh, I forgot they made sheets!

08:24.545 --> 08:26.630
Heh, yeah.

08:28.257 --> 08:31.343
I still can't believe
she hates Pottery Barn.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.053
It's not like she hates you.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.429
Yeah, but Pottery Barn?

08:38.351 --> 08:40.809
You know what I think?
She's just weird.

08:40.977 --> 08:44.356
It's because she's a twin.
Twins are weird.

08:45.358 --> 08:49.069
She's not weird. She likes
her stuff to be one-of-a-kind.

08:49.237 --> 08:53.823
Huh. You know what's
not one-of-a-kind? A twin!

08:58.663 --> 09:01.373
Let's turn out the lights
and watch the movie.

09:01.582 --> 09:05.252
- Hey, ooh, cool sheet!
- You like it?

09:05.419 --> 09:08.213
- You want to know where I got it?
- Sure.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.798
At a flea market.

09:11.300 --> 09:14.094
You buy your sheets
at a flea market?

09:14.845 --> 09:17.889
Come on, you gotta loosen the
purse strings a little.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.518
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.062
Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.898
Here is the wine to bring
over tonight.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.360
You were also gonna
buy Monica flowers...

09:30.528 --> 09:33.488
...but you couldn't because
you paid for dinner last night.

09:34.865 --> 09:38.118
Thanks. But, uh, it's just
gonna be me tonight.

09:38.286 --> 09:42.080
- What happened to Janine?
- She's, uh, really sick.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.792
- That's too bad.
- Yeah, she's been in there all day.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.671
Uh, high fever, nose problem. It's...

09:49.839 --> 09:51.923
...phlegm, phlegm,
phlegm, phlegm, phlegm.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.344
Monica! Chandler!

09:58.264 --> 10:01.933
I'm sorry about tonight.
I don't know if Joey told you...

10:02.101 --> 10:05.270
...but I couldn't get out
of going to this play.

10:07.481 --> 10:10.233
Have a great time, huh?

10:14.071 --> 10:16.573
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.

10:21.412 --> 10:22.996
Oh, no, she really is sick.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.123
Then why is she going to a play?

10:25.291 --> 10:27.626
Uh, well, you know, "Starve a fever...

10:27.793 --> 10:29.711
...go to a play for a cold."

10:31.339 --> 10:34.799
Why is Janine not coming
over for dinner?

10:34.967 --> 10:38.637
Uh, she didn't want to hang out with
you guys two nights in a row.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.472
I'm so sorry.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.600
Why doesn't she want
to hang out with us?

10:45.227 --> 10:48.897
Because she, uh, thinks that
you are "blah."

10:51.150 --> 10:53.777
And that, uh, you, Monica,
are too loud.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.445
What?!

10:56.906 --> 10:59.115
What?

10:59.283 --> 11:01.451
So she just pretended to
have a good time?

11:01.619 --> 11:03.036
She was lying to our faces?

11:03.204 --> 11:05.080
I can't believe this.

11:05.247 --> 11:06.289
Who is she to judge us?

11:06.457 --> 11:10.835
- We couldn't have been nicer to her.
- And I am not "blah." I am a hoot!

11:11.003 --> 11:12.045
I know, I know.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.589
Come on, please, you guys.
Don't be mad.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.591
I'm sure she said it...

11:16.759 --> 11:20.053
...because she was nervous 'cause
you're my best friends.

11:20.221 --> 11:22.389
And it was our first date.

11:22.556 --> 11:25.350
Plus, she's really sick.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.479
You said you made that up!

11:29.647 --> 11:32.565
But isn't the "sick" thing
better than the "play" thing?

11:33.693 --> 11:36.986
They're both good. I generally just
go with, "Monica's drunk again."

11:39.323 --> 11:42.534
Come on, please just
give her another chance.

11:42.702 --> 11:46.287
- She'll come around, I promise.
- Of course we will.

11:46.455 --> 11:49.082
- Come on, we gotta make dinner.
- Okay.

11:53.629 --> 11:55.130
I do not like that woman!

11:55.339 --> 11:57.549
I can hear you!

11:58.968 --> 12:00.093
I am loud!

12:03.764 --> 12:05.181
Aw.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.396
Isn't it good?

12:11.564 --> 12:14.733
Can you please not put your
feet up on my new...

12:15.234 --> 12:16.735
...old sheet.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.778
Oh, sure.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.948
My apothecary table!

12:22.658 --> 12:24.743
- What?
- No!

12:25.619 --> 12:28.747
- Where did you get this?
- At Pottery Barn, okay?

12:31.375 --> 12:33.251
Oh, my God!

12:33.419 --> 12:37.797
Pottery Barn has ripped off
the design of our antique!

12:39.175 --> 12:42.343
Wow. If they've ripped off our table...

12:42.511 --> 12:45.513
...ours must be worth much more
than one and fifty dollars.

12:47.641 --> 12:50.018
This doesn't even
smell like opium.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.188
It smells like wine,
which you spilled.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.356
And thanks for wrecking my sheet.

12:55.524 --> 12:59.569
Ross, calm down.
I'll give you the 80 cents.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.534
Okay, one more time.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.411
Would you like some orange juice?

13:08.579 --> 13:12.165
- Perfect decibel.
- I know!

13:14.168 --> 13:15.460
Hey.

13:15.669 --> 13:17.712
Uh, what are you guys doing?

13:17.880 --> 13:21.424
Nothing. We're just talking.
You know, blah-blah-blah.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.220
Come on, you said you were gonna try.

13:25.387 --> 13:29.057
I came over to invite you to
a movie with me and Janine.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.767
- What do you say?
- I'd like to...

13:30.935 --> 13:33.353
...but I'm not sure if we have the time.

13:34.688 --> 13:37.106
Ha, very funny. I don't know
what to do.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.234
I really want you to get along.

13:39.401 --> 13:42.195
Please, come to the movie with us.
You owe me.

13:42.404 --> 13:44.113
- We owe you?
- That's right.

13:44.281 --> 13:47.367
I helped you out in the
start of your relationship.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.744
I helped you sneak around
for six months.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.412
I looked like an idiot.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.414
And I was humiliated.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.291
And I only made $200.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.879
We didn't give you any money.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.884
You don't think I know that?

14:09.306 --> 14:12.559
I can't decide if it goes
better by the new chair...

14:12.726 --> 14:13.768
...the Sahara desk...

14:13.936 --> 14:16.187
...or the Parker console table.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.773
I didn't know there was
a Pottery Barn up here.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.527
- I know, I went a little crazy.
- A little?

14:22.695 --> 14:25.572
Your place looks like page 72
of the catalog.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.283
Look at that!

14:28.450 --> 14:32.579
- The ornamental birdcage! Large.
- Ha, ha.

14:35.374 --> 14:38.501
Oh, Ross? Be careful.
That is very old.

14:38.669 --> 14:42.964
Colonial bird merchants used to
bring their birds to market in that.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.508
Fascinating.

14:47.845 --> 14:51.347
Another amazing find! Wow.

14:51.932 --> 14:54.976
- I bet this has a great story too.
- It does.

14:55.144 --> 15:00.148
It is a room-separating apparatus
from Colonial times.

15:00.733 --> 15:04.611
Huh, a lot of this stuff is from
the Colonial times.

15:04.778 --> 15:07.822
What are some other
time periods, Rachel?

15:10.242 --> 15:11.826
Well, there's yore.

15:13.913 --> 15:17.874
Ahem, and, uh, you know, yesteryear.

15:19.126 --> 15:22.795
Rachel has such a
good eye for this stuff.

15:22.963 --> 15:25.423
Ross, if you ever decide
to redecorate...

15:25.591 --> 15:28.051
- and I think you should...

15:28.218 --> 15:29.969
- you should ask Rachel to help.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.679
Aw, he doesn't need my help.

15:31.847 --> 15:35.141
I think he's ready to get rid
of the... What'd you call it?

15:35.309 --> 15:37.644
The, uh, "cheap knockoffs
and dinosaur junk"?

15:42.566 --> 15:44.275
Really?

15:45.319 --> 15:49.530
You know, since you have such a
great sense of what I need...

15:49.698 --> 15:51.574
Uh, here's 60 bucks.

15:51.742 --> 15:55.703
Why don't you take Phoebe down
to that Colonial, uh, flea market...

15:55.871 --> 15:57.413
...and get me some stuff?

16:02.294 --> 16:04.587
I don't think Phoebe wants to come.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.589
- I do want to.
- She does want to.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.257
- She does want to.
- Yeah!

16:14.640 --> 16:18.267
I guess the flea market
was just better last time.

16:18.435 --> 16:21.354
Well, at least I got these
sheets for Ross.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.400
Ugh, look at this. Pottery Barn.

16:25.567 --> 16:29.112
Ugh, yeah, you know what?
Don't look at it.

16:29.279 --> 16:31.781
- Seriously, don't look at it.
- Look!

16:31.949 --> 16:34.158
There's the table
they stole from us.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.285
Oh, those bastards! Let's go.

16:37.830 --> 16:42.458
That fan kind of looks like ours,
and the birdcage, and...

16:42.835 --> 16:45.795
Wait a second, this is our
exact living room!

16:45.963 --> 16:48.131
No, it's not.

16:48.298 --> 16:50.633
Come on, ours is totally different.

16:50.801 --> 16:54.595
I mean, we don't have the...
We don't have that lamp.

16:55.347 --> 16:59.767
And that screen is on
the other side.

17:00.686 --> 17:03.938
Oh, my God. This is where you
got all our stuff.

17:04.106 --> 17:07.108
- Pottery Barn! Oh, my God!
- No. No.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.736
Okay, I did, all right?
I'm sorry.

17:09.903 --> 17:13.990
I wanted this stuff and I know
how you feel about Pottery Barn.

17:14.157 --> 17:17.076
- Come on, don't be mad.
- No, but I am mad.

17:17.243 --> 17:20.329
Because this stuff is what's
wrong with the world...

17:20.497 --> 17:22.874
...and it's in my living room...

17:23.041 --> 17:27.002
...and all I can think about is
how I don't have that lamp!

17:28.213 --> 17:30.131
Well, then, honey, buy the lamp.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.633
We have that 60 bucks from Ross.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.971
I can't! I can't!

17:37.473 --> 17:39.098
Unless...

17:39.266 --> 17:43.102
Are you saying you'd move out
if I didn't buy that lamp?

17:43.270 --> 17:45.354
No, I'm not gonna move out!

17:45.522 --> 17:49.484
But are you saying that you would
move out if I didn't buy that lamp?

17:50.944 --> 17:54.280
- Yes! I would so move out.
- Then I don't have a choice.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.825
- I have to buy that lamp!
- That's right.

17:58.535 --> 18:00.828
But at least the apothecary
table's real.

18:06.376 --> 18:09.921
This was great.
Didn't everybody have a great time?

18:10.089 --> 18:12.757
I did. I really did.
And I've got to say...

18:12.925 --> 18:16.469
...I'm sorry if I was weird after
the last time we went out.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.387
I guess I was just nervous.

18:18.555 --> 18:21.432
- That's understandable.
- Don't worry about it.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.850
So we can go out again?

18:23.018 --> 18:24.644
- Absolutely.
- Well, good.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.063
- Okay, well, good night.
- Good night.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.277
See, huh?

18:33.445 --> 18:34.695
Wasn't that fun?

18:34.863 --> 18:36.781
We have got to move.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.991
What?

18:39.159 --> 18:40.493
I knew it!

18:42.246 --> 18:44.705
You're not so quiet yourself, missy!

18:46.625 --> 18:49.585
I'm blah? The only thing more
boring than modern dance...

18:49.753 --> 18:51.129
...is you talking about it.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.755
"Oh, Chandler...

18:52.923 --> 18:54.966
...I just lost myself in the movement."

18:58.178 --> 19:00.346
You know, I know you're talking...

19:00.514 --> 19:03.349
...but all I hear is
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.894
All right, you and me!
Let's go, right now!

19:07.062 --> 19:08.396
All right, enough!

19:09.231 --> 19:12.608
Enough! You two, go home.
I gotta talk to Janine.

19:12.776 --> 19:15.236
I really think you could take her.

19:15.737 --> 19:17.989
You better hope I don't
see you in the hallway!

19:23.412 --> 19:25.121
All right. Uh...

19:25.289 --> 19:27.999
Look, we got a little bit
of a problem here.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.626
You can't my treat
my friends that way.

19:30.794 --> 19:35.381
- They said stuff to me too.
- I know, I'll talk to them about it.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.258
They mean so much to me.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.719
They're like my family, you know?

19:39.887 --> 19:43.055
If you guys are gonna be
fighting all the time...

19:44.433 --> 19:48.311
I don't think we can be together.
It just can't work, okay?

19:48.478 --> 19:49.645
It can't.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.606
I'm very upset.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.817
Okay.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.278
Would it help if I apologized?

19:57.487 --> 19:59.155
Yeah.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.115
That'd be very helpful.

20:06.079 --> 20:08.789
What did I tell you about the hall?

20:10.876 --> 20:13.878
I was coming over to
apologize for my behavior.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.090
I'd really like it if we
could be friends.

20:20.677 --> 20:24.931
Well, I know that would
make Joey happy, so...

20:25.098 --> 20:27.225
...I would like that too.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.895
- Great.
- Now, come on.

20:33.982 --> 20:36.359
- I'm glad we worked it out.
- Me too.

20:36.526 --> 20:38.486
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

20:38.654 --> 20:41.822
- Or I'll hear you.
- That's it, big girl!

20:43.867 --> 20:45.493
Wait!

20:49.081 --> 20:51.249
You'd better run!

20:52.167 --> 20:54.126
Did you hear that?

20:55.295 --> 20:57.964
- What am I gonna do?
- I'm sorry, man.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.842
- Want to go watch?
- Yeah!

21:10.477 --> 21:11.519
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:11.687 --> 21:14.397
- How you doing?
- So, uh, did she move out?

21:14.564 --> 21:16.399
Pretty much.

21:16.566 --> 21:18.943
I can't believe you just
broke up with her.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.195
When it's not right, you know it.

21:21.363 --> 21:24.615
- You okay?
- I'll be all right.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.953
- You know what'd cheer you up?
- What?

21:29.162 --> 21:33.082
I'm giving this lecture on
erosion theories tomorrow night.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.169
I think you should come.

21:44.052 --> 21:46.304
You're right, that did cheer me up.
