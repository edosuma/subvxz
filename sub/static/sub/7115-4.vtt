00:36.500 --> 00:38.968
Sometimes it's nice.

00:39.002 --> 00:40.269
Oh, a massage helmet!

00:40.304 --> 00:41.170
A stylish helmet

00:41.204 --> 00:42.338
That massages your head.

00:42.372 --> 00:43.739
That sounds fun, right?

00:44.274 --> 00:44.974
It could be.

00:45.008 --> 00:45.508
Oh, it should.

00:45.542 --> 00:46.442
No, it's awful.

00:46.476 --> 00:46.942
I hate helmets.

00:46.977 --> 00:47.710
That's not good of an idea.

00:47.744 --> 00:49.578
It's a bad thing.

00:50.580 --> 00:51.647
Why is she all...

00:51.682 --> 00:52.515
'Cause it's only three days

00:52.549 --> 00:53.983
Until Trina's birthweek.

00:54.017 --> 00:55.418
Her birthweek?

00:55.452 --> 00:56.652
You mean her birthday?

00:57.154 --> 00:57.820
You don't know my sister.

00:57.854 --> 00:58.654
She thinks one day

00:58.689 --> 00:59.655
Isn't enough celebration

00:59.690 --> 01:01.357
So she calls it her birthweek.

01:01.391 --> 01:02.024
Now if I don't get her

01:02.059 --> 01:02.558
An amazing present,

01:02.592 --> 01:03.359
I'm gonna have to listen to her

01:03.393 --> 01:03.926
Complain about it

01:03.960 --> 01:05.361
For the next six months.

01:05.394 --> 01:06.128
All right.

01:06.163 --> 01:07.029
Chill down.

01:07.064 --> 01:08.264
We'll help you through this.

01:08.298 --> 01:08.664
Totally.

01:09.266 --> 01:10.933
Okay.

01:10.967 --> 01:11.834
The perfect present

01:11.868 --> 01:13.269
For Trina.

01:13.303 --> 01:15.871
Something amazing.

01:15.906 --> 01:18.307
Just get the massage helmet.

01:18.342 --> 01:21.410
Oh, my ribs!

02:33.514 --> 02:35.315
Suggestions for birthweek

02:35.350 --> 02:37.851
Presents for Trina.

02:37.885 --> 02:38.752
Okay.

02:38.786 --> 02:41.221
Andre, start us off.

02:41.255 --> 02:44.391
Cheese.

02:44.425 --> 02:47.060
Let's not do cheese.

02:47.095 --> 02:48.128
Robbie?

02:48.162 --> 02:52.799
Lotion or various lotions.

02:52.834 --> 02:53.333
Gross.

02:53.368 --> 02:54.001
Cat?

02:54.035 --> 02:55.602
Well, for my last birthday,

02:55.637 --> 02:56.336
I thought my parents

02:56.371 --> 02:57.337
Were gonna get me a bike.

02:57.372 --> 02:58.305
But when I got home from school,

02:58.339 --> 02:59.306
My brother was trying to cut off

02:59.340 --> 02:59.840
His hair.

02:59.874 --> 03:00.874
So my mom started yelling at...

03:00.908 --> 03:01.642
Jade.

03:01.676 --> 03:02.776
Yeah?

03:02.810 --> 03:04.311
What should I get Trina?

03:04.345 --> 03:06.513
Talent.

03:06.514 --> 03:09.416
Oh, Jade is so pretty.

03:09.450 --> 03:13.286
3, 2, 1.

03:13.321 --> 03:14.921
Does anyone have a good idea

03:14.956 --> 03:16.356
About a present for Trina?

03:16.391 --> 03:19.826
You people give me a rash.

03:19.861 --> 03:22.629
What kind of rash?

03:25.600 --> 03:26.299
It's my grandmother again.

03:26.334 --> 03:27.968
Who else would call you?

03:29.370 --> 03:31.204
Hi, Mammaw.

03:31.239 --> 03:34.141
Uch, another computer problem?

03:34.175 --> 03:35.308
No, Mammaw.

03:35.343 --> 03:37.044
I was not being sarcastic.

03:37.078 --> 03:38.512
Mammaw, don't...what?

03:38.546 --> 03:40.981
Mammaw, don't hang up on me.

03:41.015 --> 03:41.682
What's your grandmother

03:41.716 --> 03:42.516
Bugging about?

03:43.484 --> 03:44.685
She bought a stupid computer

03:44.719 --> 03:45.352
And she can't figure out

03:45.386 --> 03:46.219
How to work it,

03:46.254 --> 03:46.787
So she calls me

03:46.821 --> 03:47.854
Like every four minutes

03:47.889 --> 03:49.356
For tech support.

03:49.390 --> 03:50.824
Oh, that's cute.

03:50.858 --> 03:51.758
It's not cute.

03:51.793 --> 03:52.592
I was at her house

03:52.627 --> 03:53.994
For three hours last night

03:54.028 --> 03:54.761
And I have to go back again

03:54.796 --> 03:56.196
Tonight.

03:56.230 --> 03:57.230
Oh, will one of you come

03:57.265 --> 03:58.165
With me?

03:58.199 --> 03:59.733
Sure, I love old people.

03:59.767 --> 04:00.901
It's so cute how they shake

04:00.935 --> 04:04.071
When they pour their juice.

04:04.105 --> 04:04.905
You know what

04:04.939 --> 04:06.006
That makes me think of?

04:06.040 --> 04:06.540
What?

04:06.574 --> 04:08.175
Nothing.

04:08.209 --> 04:09.142
Now what am I gonna get Trina

04:09.177 --> 04:11.712
For her birthweek?

04:11.746 --> 04:12.446
How about a bobblehead

04:12.480 --> 04:16.750
That looks like me?

04:16.784 --> 04:17.451
My dad's a cop.

04:17.485 --> 04:19.486
Moving on.

04:23.725 --> 04:24.958
All right.

04:24.992 --> 04:26.293
Before I take you in there,

04:26.327 --> 04:27.461
I should warn you.

04:27.495 --> 04:28.328
About?

04:28.362 --> 04:29.396
My grandmother.

04:29.430 --> 04:31.832
She can be critical.

04:31.866 --> 04:32.466
That's okay.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.801
I take criticism really well.

04:34.836 --> 04:35.836
No, you don't.

04:35.870 --> 04:37.170
What's that suppose to mean?

04:37.205 --> 04:38.038
Just that you don't take

04:38.072 --> 04:39.339
Criticism very well.

04:39.373 --> 04:40.107
Why don't you just kick me

04:40.141 --> 04:42.309
In the face?

04:42.343 --> 04:42.909
I'm sorry.

04:42.944 --> 04:43.777
I take it back.

04:43.811 --> 04:48.648
Okay.

04:48.683 --> 04:52.052
I have a gun.

04:52.086 --> 04:55.922
Mammaw, it's Robbie.

04:55.957 --> 04:56.423
Hello, Robbie.

04:56.457 --> 04:58.959
Hi, Mammaw.

04:58.993 --> 05:00.127
This is my friend, Cat.

05:00.161 --> 05:00.660
Nice to meet you,

05:00.695 --> 05:01.561
Mrs. Shapiro.

05:01.596 --> 05:02.596
You too, sweetheart.

05:02.630 --> 05:04.030
You're so pretty.

05:04.065 --> 05:04.664
Come in.

05:04.699 --> 05:06.733
Come in.

05:06.768 --> 05:08.135
She's your girlfriend?

05:08.169 --> 05:08.969
No.

05:09.003 --> 05:09.369
Good.

05:09.403 --> 05:12.706
You can do better.

05:22.850 --> 05:24.017
Are you ready for this?

05:24.051 --> 05:24.818
I don't know.

05:24.852 --> 05:27.120
I can't see.

05:27.155 --> 05:30.056
Look it.

05:30.091 --> 05:30.924
Shoes?

05:30.958 --> 05:32.325
Boots.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.127
Fazzini boots.

05:35.897 --> 05:36.663
Trina has been dying

05:36.697 --> 05:37.030
For these.

05:37.064 --> 05:37.430
I had to go

05:37.465 --> 05:38.298
To 11 different stores

05:38.332 --> 05:38.899
Before I could...

05:38.933 --> 05:41.301
Hello.

05:41.335 --> 05:42.202
Hey.

05:42.236 --> 05:43.436
What's up, Trina?

05:43.471 --> 05:44.004
Okay.

05:44.038 --> 05:45.705
What has two thumbs

05:45.740 --> 05:46.306
And is already having

05:46.340 --> 05:49.142
A fantastic birthweek?

05:49.177 --> 05:52.412
This girl.

05:52.446 --> 05:55.515
Check out my kicks.

05:55.550 --> 05:57.617
Fazzini boots.

05:57.652 --> 06:01.388
Got 'em at simone's on sale.

06:02.323 --> 06:03.456
Oh, don't be sad.

06:03.491 --> 06:04.391
You could borrow 'em,

06:04.425 --> 06:07.294
After I'm dead.

06:07.328 --> 06:09.696
Mom, I got fazzini boots.

06:09.730 --> 06:12.933
Mom. Mom!

06:12.967 --> 06:14.067
You're gonna have to come up

06:14.101 --> 06:14.901
With another present.

06:14.936 --> 06:17.337
I know that.

06:17.371 --> 06:18.071
Got a cheese guy

06:18.105 --> 06:18.772
That could put together...

06:18.806 --> 06:22.375
I'm not giving her cheese.

06:22.410 --> 06:23.243
Maybe I should just give up

06:23.277 --> 06:23.777
And accept the fact

06:23.811 --> 06:24.444
That I'm not gonna find

06:24.478 --> 06:25.111
Anything good

06:25.146 --> 06:25.846
And Trina is gonna hate me

06:25.880 --> 06:27.681
For the next six months.

06:27.715 --> 06:28.281
I can't believe

06:28.316 --> 06:30.483
You hit me in the head.

06:30.518 --> 06:32.118
Help me.

06:32.153 --> 06:34.287
All right.

06:34.322 --> 06:35.755
How about a song?

06:35.790 --> 06:36.623
A song,

06:36.657 --> 06:37.557
As a present for Trina?

06:37.592 --> 06:38.725
Yeah.

06:38.759 --> 06:39.292
You can write it,

06:39.327 --> 06:40.393
Perform it yourself,

06:40.428 --> 06:41.995
You know, do it up real big.

06:42.029 --> 06:43.496
That's not bad.

06:43.531 --> 06:44.831
That is...I don't know how

06:44.866 --> 06:47.734
To write a song.

06:47.768 --> 06:49.469
Think, what has two thumbs

06:49.503 --> 06:50.303
And knows how to help a friend

06:50.338 --> 06:52.505
Write a song?

06:52.540 --> 06:56.509
This guy.

06:59.814 --> 07:01.748
No. No. No. No. No. No.

07:01.782 --> 07:03.383
You just...you just click

07:03.417 --> 07:04.751
On that little square

07:04.785 --> 07:05.585
In the upper right corner

07:05.620 --> 07:06.820
To open a window.

07:06.854 --> 07:07.354
I don't want

07:07.388 --> 07:08.221
To open a window.

07:08.256 --> 07:11.524
It's already too cold in here.

07:11.559 --> 07:12.959
That's not what I meant.

07:12.994 --> 07:15.295
Maury, turn up the heat.

07:15.329 --> 07:17.230
No.

07:17.265 --> 07:18.231
Mammaw, a window

07:18.266 --> 07:19.232
Is just this little...

07:19.267 --> 07:20.100
Why did you do that

07:20.134 --> 07:22.068
To your hair?

07:22.103 --> 07:22.702
What?

07:22.737 --> 07:24.037
You mean the color?

07:24.071 --> 07:25.739
Do you hate your mother?

07:25.773 --> 07:27.841
I love my mother.

07:27.875 --> 07:28.975
So how do I e-Mail this

07:29.010 --> 07:31.011
To my doctor?

07:31.045 --> 07:32.012
E-Mail?

07:32.046 --> 07:32.479
Those are your

07:32.513 --> 07:33.847
System preferences.

07:33.881 --> 07:35.115
Why would you e-Mail a doctor

07:35.149 --> 07:37.150
Your system preferences?

07:37.184 --> 07:38.151
Maury,

07:38.185 --> 07:40.587
Robbie is screaming at me.

07:40.621 --> 07:41.721
I'm hungry.

07:41.756 --> 07:44.291
Turn up the heat.

07:44.325 --> 07:46.693
No.

07:46.727 --> 07:53.600
Why does he do that to me?

07:53.634 --> 07:56.303
Okay, how about this?

08:09.517 --> 08:10.417
I love that.

08:10.451 --> 08:10.951
But you really think

08:10.985 --> 08:11.584
We're gonna be able

08:11.619 --> 08:12.552
To have a whole song ready

08:12.586 --> 08:13.687
By Trina's birthday?

08:13.721 --> 08:14.654
No worries.

08:14.689 --> 08:15.121
And I'll get

08:15.156 --> 08:16.022
A banging band here,

08:16.057 --> 08:17.691
Some girls to back you up,

08:17.725 --> 08:19.726
Lights, it'll be the chiz.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.628
What is chiz anyway?

08:21.662 --> 08:22.228
I think

08:22.263 --> 08:25.231
It's a german sausage.

08:25.266 --> 08:26.599
Let's get back to the lyrics.

08:26.634 --> 08:28.234
No. I can't write lyrics.

08:28.269 --> 08:28.835
Just play more stuff

08:28.869 --> 08:30.770
On your thingy.

08:30.805 --> 08:31.338
I'll help you.

08:31.372 --> 08:31.905
Just tell me some

08:31.939 --> 08:32.806
Of your favorite things

08:32.840 --> 08:37.510
About Trina.

08:37.544 --> 08:38.645
I said tell me some of your...

08:38.679 --> 08:41.581
I heard you.

08:41.615 --> 08:43.249
Come on, dig deep.

08:43.284 --> 08:45.652
Okay. Okay.

08:45.686 --> 08:46.252
Oh, how about

08:46.287 --> 08:47.287
She's the whole reason

08:47.321 --> 08:48.855
Why I got in to hollywood arts?

08:48.889 --> 08:50.090
Now you're digging.

08:50.124 --> 08:52.525
Yay, I'm diggy.

08:52.560 --> 08:52.959
All right.

08:52.994 --> 08:54.361
Now, when you think of Trina,

08:54.395 --> 08:54.995
What's the first word

08:55.029 --> 08:56.262
That pops in your head?

08:56.297 --> 08:58.098
Crazy.

08:58.132 --> 08:58.865
Crazy.

08:58.899 --> 08:59.899
But, I love her.

08:59.934 --> 09:00.433
Have you told her

09:00.468 --> 09:01.368
That lately?

09:01.402 --> 09:02.202
No.

09:02.236 --> 09:03.203
Wait, are you sure this stuff

09:03.237 --> 09:05.005
Is gonna help us write a song?

09:05.039 --> 09:09.209
Let's see.

09:20.988 --> 09:23.223
You're good.

09:35.336 --> 09:36.369
I'm home.

09:36.404 --> 09:41.241
Happy birthweek.

09:41.275 --> 09:42.409
Mom.

09:42.443 --> 09:43.810
Oh, dad.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.645
...make a wish.

09:45.679 --> 09:48.715
Okay.

09:50.518 --> 09:51.418
Where's Tori?

09:51.452 --> 09:52.986
Oh, over there.

09:53.020 --> 09:54.454
With a special surprise.

09:54.488 --> 09:59.359
Whoa. Hey.

09:59.393 --> 10:02.028
You're gonna love it.

10:02.063 --> 10:03.663
What is going on?

10:03.697 --> 10:08.668
Just relax.

12:34.815 --> 12:36.482
Happy birthweek, Trina.

12:36.517 --> 12:38.017
Thanks.

12:38.052 --> 12:41.521
So where is my present?

12:49.231 --> 12:50.331
Are you kidding me?

12:50.366 --> 12:50.865
No.

12:50.900 --> 12:53.168
Where's my birthweek present?

12:53.202 --> 12:54.435
Mom, dad,

12:54.470 --> 12:55.103
Could you please take Andre

12:55.137 --> 12:56.271
And everyone outside?

12:56.305 --> 12:58.973
But it's raining.

12:59.008 --> 13:00.441
Here's an umbrella.

13:00.476 --> 13:04.979
This way, everyone.

13:05.014 --> 13:06.281
Don't break anything.

13:06.315 --> 13:10.952
No promises.

13:10.986 --> 13:13.688
The song was your present.

13:13.722 --> 13:15.857
How much did it cost?

13:15.891 --> 13:17.358
It didn't cost money.

13:17.393 --> 13:19.427
Then it's not a present.

13:19.461 --> 13:21.563
Oh, you're unbelievable.

13:21.597 --> 13:22.330
I'm not the one

13:22.364 --> 13:23.164
Who didn't get her sister

13:23.199 --> 13:25.133
A present for her birthweek.

13:25.167 --> 13:26.834
I wrote a song for you.

13:26.869 --> 13:27.969
I rehearsed it.

13:28.003 --> 13:28.403
The people,

13:28.437 --> 13:29.971
I performed it for you.

13:30.005 --> 13:30.638
Yeah, I think

13:30.673 --> 13:31.239
You were a little flat

13:31.273 --> 13:33.107
On that last chorus.

13:33.142 --> 13:34.509
Ah, can't hit your sister

13:34.543 --> 13:36.978
During her birthweek.

13:39.748 --> 13:45.119
That's a cool watch.

13:45.154 --> 13:46.087
I can't believe

13:46.121 --> 13:46.921
That you're not deep enough

13:46.956 --> 13:47.555
To appreciate a gift

13:47.590 --> 13:49.090
That totally came from my heart.

13:49.124 --> 13:50.525
A song is not a gift.

13:50.559 --> 13:52.860
It is too.

13:52.895 --> 13:54.562
Can I wear a song? No.

13:54.597 --> 13:55.863
Can I eat a song? No.

13:55.898 --> 13:56.598
Can I flaunt a song

13:56.632 --> 13:57.565
And make anyone jealous?

13:57.600 --> 13:59.801
No. You failed.

13:59.835 --> 14:01.536
Here. I am so sorry

14:01.570 --> 14:04.105
This is all I got you.

14:04.139 --> 14:04.872
What is this?

14:04.907 --> 14:05.373
A flash drive

14:05.407 --> 14:06.708
With the song on it.

14:06.742 --> 14:07.742
How many gigs?

14:07.776 --> 14:09.410
I don't know. Eight?

14:09.445 --> 14:11.913
Kinda small.

14:14.450 --> 14:15.483
But the most surprising part

14:15.517 --> 14:16.117
Of the play

14:16.151 --> 14:16.751
Happened at the end

14:16.785 --> 14:17.385
When the monster

14:17.419 --> 14:18.620
Gouged out pricilla's eyes,

14:18.654 --> 14:19.654
Which, for whatever reason,

14:19.688 --> 14:24.225
I found really funny. Questions?

14:24.260 --> 14:25.627
I have two questions.

14:25.661 --> 14:26.294
Okay, no questions.

14:26.328 --> 14:28.396
Great, I'm done.

14:28.430 --> 14:29.764
Thank you, Jade,

14:29.798 --> 14:32.500
For that disturbing report.

14:32.534 --> 14:35.069
Robbie, you're up.

14:35.104 --> 14:41.809
Right.

14:41.844 --> 14:42.810
Hello, everybody.

14:42.845 --> 14:46.080
Hi.

14:46.115 --> 14:50.184
My report is on vaudeville.

14:50.219 --> 14:52.387
Now, if you all look at...

14:52.421 --> 14:54.889
Oh, my God.

14:54.923 --> 14:56.090
Your grandmother

14:56.125 --> 14:57.692
Wants to chat.

14:57.726 --> 14:59.894
Robbie, Robbie,

14:59.928 --> 15:02.096
Can you see me now?

15:02.131 --> 15:03.665
Hi, Mammaw.

15:03.699 --> 15:04.299
Is this important?

15:04.333 --> 15:05.166
'Cause I'm kinda in the middle

15:05.200 --> 15:05.433
Of...

15:05.467 --> 15:08.202
How do I open the internet?

15:08.237 --> 15:09.270
Grandma, grandma,

15:09.305 --> 15:10.571
You're on the internet.

15:10.606 --> 15:11.773
We couldn't be video-Chatting

15:11.807 --> 15:12.440
If you weren't on...

15:12.474 --> 15:13.308
Hey, Robbie,

15:13.342 --> 15:15.109
I see your puppet.

15:15.144 --> 15:16.978
Are you still taking your puppet

15:17.012 --> 15:18.346
To school?

15:18.380 --> 15:20.014
Rex is not a puppet.

15:20.049 --> 15:21.783
Maury, Robbie still plays

15:21.817 --> 15:23.985
With his puppet.

15:24.019 --> 15:26.421
I'm in the bathroom.

15:26.455 --> 15:27.922
Doing what?

15:30.192 --> 15:34.896
Robbie, Robbie, Robbie.

15:44.239 --> 15:46.274
Hey, Vega!

15:46.308 --> 15:47.508
Tori.

15:47.543 --> 15:48.376
What?

15:48.410 --> 15:48.943
Try this coffee

15:48.977 --> 15:54.682
And tell me what it tastes like.

15:54.717 --> 15:55.450
Hazelnut?

15:55.484 --> 15:56.017
I don't know.

15:56.051 --> 16:01.089
I found it in the garbage.

16:01.123 --> 16:02.090
Hey, Tori.

16:02.124 --> 16:03.157
Hey, Tori's friend.

16:03.192 --> 16:03.658
No,

16:03.692 --> 16:06.594
I'm not really her friend.

16:06.628 --> 16:07.895
So listen...

16:07.930 --> 16:09.330
I'm not buying you a present.

16:09.365 --> 16:11.799
Ah, you already did.

16:11.834 --> 16:13.234
This hat.

16:13.268 --> 16:14.369
I didn't buy you that hat.

16:14.403 --> 16:15.837
Did too.

16:15.871 --> 16:17.538
Well, indirectly.

16:17.573 --> 16:18.906
See, I sold the song

16:18.941 --> 16:19.774
And used the money

16:19.808 --> 16:20.541
To buy the hat.

16:20.576 --> 16:21.709
I know most girls can't pull off

16:21.744 --> 16:22.343
The whole hat look,

16:22.378 --> 16:23.678
But my head has a perfect shape,

16:23.712 --> 16:24.112
You know, so...

16:25.814 --> 16:26.280
What do you mean

16:26.315 --> 16:28.316
You sold the song I gave you?

16:28.350 --> 16:28.983
Well, you know

16:29.017 --> 16:29.851
My friend molly?

16:29.885 --> 16:31.185
Little feet, big thighs.

16:31.220 --> 16:33.755
Mm-Hmm. Her uncle

16:33.789 --> 16:34.622
Is one of the main dudes

16:34.656 --> 16:35.790
At devilution records.

16:35.824 --> 16:37.091
I played the song for him

16:37.126 --> 16:39.494
And he, like, freaked over it.

16:39.528 --> 16:40.395
The song I sang

16:40.429 --> 16:41.329
For your birthday?

16:41.363 --> 16:41.963
Yeah.

16:41.997 --> 16:43.231
He gave me 500 bucks

16:43.265 --> 16:43.965
For the rights.

16:43.999 --> 16:46.634
And get this: He wants me

16:46.668 --> 16:48.436
To record it professionally.

16:48.470 --> 16:50.505
You? You're gonna sing it?

16:50.539 --> 16:51.072
Of course,

16:51.106 --> 16:52.573
He thinks it could be a hit.

16:52.608 --> 16:54.208
I turned your terrible present

16:54.243 --> 16:55.109
Into a new hat

16:55.144 --> 16:57.311
And a great opportunity.

16:57.346 --> 16:57.879
But wait,

16:57.913 --> 16:59.213
But, but, but, but does he know

16:59.248 --> 17:00.081
That I was the one

17:00.115 --> 17:02.083
Singing the song and not you?

17:02.117 --> 17:02.817
You know,

17:02.851 --> 17:05.453
That did not come up.

17:05.487 --> 17:06.087
Trina,

17:06.121 --> 17:07.054
How can you just do that?

17:07.089 --> 17:07.521
You can't...

17:07.556 --> 17:08.455
Got to scamper.

17:08.490 --> 17:09.290
Hey, are you gonna finish

17:09.324 --> 17:10.191
Your coffee?

17:10.224 --> 17:10.590
No.

17:10.626 --> 17:13.728
Jade found this in the...

17:13.762 --> 17:18.499
You can have it.

17:18.534 --> 17:20.001
That's right,

17:20.035 --> 17:26.741
Drink the garbage coffee.

17:26.775 --> 17:27.875
Come on.

17:27.910 --> 17:28.876
No.

17:28.911 --> 17:29.577
You said you were talking me

17:29.611 --> 17:31.913
To play baby golf.

17:31.947 --> 17:32.713
We'll only be here

17:32.748 --> 17:35.082
A half hour.

17:35.117 --> 17:35.750
But your grandmother

17:35.784 --> 17:36.684
Hates me.

17:36.718 --> 17:39.654
She doesn't hate you.

17:40.456 --> 17:43.424
Why did you bring that one?

17:43.459 --> 17:44.225
Bye.

17:44.259 --> 17:49.096
Stay.

17:49.131 --> 17:50.364
Who is this?

17:50.399 --> 17:51.666
Robbie, this is brenda,

17:51.700 --> 17:53.568
My friend rona's cousin's

17:53.602 --> 17:55.269
Granddaughter.

17:55.304 --> 17:56.070
Brenda,

17:56.104 --> 17:59.373
This is my grandson, Robbie.

17:59.408 --> 18:00.875
Hi, it's great to meet you.

18:00.909 --> 18:02.076
Why is she here?

18:02.110 --> 18:03.277
So you don't end up

18:03.312 --> 18:05.480
With one of those.

18:05.514 --> 18:06.280
I'm leaving now.

18:06.315 --> 18:07.849
No, you're not.

18:07.883 --> 18:09.617
Robbie is so smart.

18:09.651 --> 18:11.886
He's here to fix the internet.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.454
Yeah, why don't I go do that?

18:13.489 --> 18:14.489
Hey, what's your rush?

18:14.523 --> 18:15.289
Spend some time,

18:15.324 --> 18:17.325
Get to know brenda.

18:17.359 --> 18:18.826
Mammaw.

18:18.861 --> 18:22.430
Is that a face?

18:26.935 --> 18:27.969
Trina, you set?

18:28.003 --> 18:30.304
I am super set.

18:30.339 --> 18:30.771
Okay,

18:30.806 --> 18:32.106
Then we're gonna put one down.

18:32.140 --> 18:36.043
Yes, let's put one down.

18:36.078 --> 18:37.044
Track one.

18:37.079 --> 18:37.845
Playback.

19:00.969 --> 19:02.169
I'm not hearing any music

19:02.204 --> 19:03.170
Anymore.

19:03.205 --> 19:05.072
Uh, yeah, your vocal,

19:05.107 --> 19:06.073
You're not sounding like you did

19:06.108 --> 19:06.674
On the live demo

19:06.708 --> 19:07.608
You played for me.

19:07.643 --> 19:09.677
Oh, right.

19:09.711 --> 19:10.278
I was just trying it

19:10.312 --> 19:11.245
A different way.

19:11.280 --> 19:11.946
Oh, okay.

19:11.980 --> 19:12.980
Well, why don't you just try

19:13.015 --> 19:13.714
Singing it like you did

19:13.749 --> 19:15.249
On the demo?

19:15.284 --> 19:15.950
Yes, sir.

19:15.984 --> 19:17.151
No problemo.

19:17.185 --> 19:18.753
Great, great.

19:18.787 --> 19:20.354
Let's go again.

19:20.389 --> 19:21.589
Take two.

19:34.770 --> 19:35.469
Can't you make her sound

19:35.504 --> 19:36.404
Better?

19:36.438 --> 19:40.708
Yup.

19:40.742 --> 19:42.310
You just turned off her mic.

19:44.980 --> 19:46.113
Sound better?

19:46.148 --> 19:56.724
Yeah.

19:56.758 --> 19:58.092
A girl doesn't dye her hair

19:58.126 --> 19:59.126
That color unless

19:59.161 --> 20:01.362
She has psychological problems.

20:01.396 --> 20:01.996
My hair color

20:02.030 --> 20:02.863
Has nothing to do

20:02.898 --> 20:04.532
With my psychological problems.

20:04.566 --> 20:05.199
Don't you use

20:05.233 --> 20:07.168
That tone with me, young lady.

20:07.202 --> 20:07.668
Well, you said

20:07.703 --> 20:08.803
A bunch of mean things to me.

20:08.837 --> 20:09.770
My mom thinks it's funny.

20:09.805 --> 20:10.371
Why would your mother

20:10.405 --> 20:11.806
Allow that.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.040
Over my dead body, would I let

20:13.075 --> 20:13.908
My grandson ever marry...

20:13.942 --> 20:16.510
We're just friends.

20:16.545 --> 20:17.011
No, no, no.

20:17.045 --> 20:18.679
Oh, this is bad news.

20:18.714 --> 20:20.181
Oh, no.

20:20.215 --> 20:21.148
What?

20:21.183 --> 20:22.917
What's wrong, sweetheart?

20:22.951 --> 20:25.453
They canceled the internet.

20:26.355 --> 20:29.590
Yeah, look.

20:29.625 --> 20:30.558
You know, bad economy,

20:30.592 --> 20:31.292
Low ratings,

20:31.326 --> 20:32.493
They just cancelled

20:32.527 --> 20:33.661
The whole internet.

20:33.695 --> 20:34.328
It says right there

20:34.363 --> 20:35.363
On the screen.

20:35.397 --> 20:38.633
Aww, that's too bad.

20:38.667 --> 20:39.800
That's terrible.

20:39.835 --> 20:41.569
Yeah, it's a tragedy.

20:41.603 --> 20:42.169
Bye, Mammaw.

20:42.204 --> 20:43.904
Let's go, Cat.

20:43.939 --> 20:45.439
Hey, wait, Robbie.

20:45.474 --> 20:47.108
I made you a chicken.

20:47.142 --> 20:47.975
Give it to brenda.

20:48.010 --> 20:50.945
Bye.

21:03.125 --> 21:07.561
Oh, no! Oh, no, no.

21:07.596 --> 21:08.562
What happened?

21:08.597 --> 21:09.263
I was feeling that one.

21:09.297 --> 21:11.866
You weren't feeling it?

21:11.900 --> 21:13.167
Okay, what up?

21:13.201 --> 21:13.668
Oh, you want me

21:13.702 --> 21:14.502
To sing louder?

21:14.536 --> 21:17.204
No. That live demo

21:17.239 --> 21:18.072
You played for me,

21:18.106 --> 21:18.739
How come you can't sing

21:18.774 --> 21:20.107
Like that now?

21:20.142 --> 21:22.376
Well...

21:22.411 --> 21:22.977
Are you the singer

21:23.011 --> 21:24.445
On the demo or not?

21:24.479 --> 21:27.114
I'm genetically similar

21:27.149 --> 21:29.250
To that singer.

21:29.284 --> 21:30.084
All right, that's it.

21:30.118 --> 21:30.851
I'm pulling the plug on this.

21:30.886 --> 21:31.318
No, no, wait.

21:31.353 --> 21:32.219
Hey, pull the plug, man.

21:32.254 --> 21:32.853
We're going home.

21:32.888 --> 21:34.255
Just wait a second.

21:34.289 --> 21:36.057
Let me fix this.

21:36.091 --> 21:40.461
How?

21:40.495 --> 21:41.162
What...who are you gonna call?

21:41.196 --> 21:43.130
Just shush.

21:52.641 --> 21:54.075
She killing it or what?

21:54.109 --> 21:55.509
She's fantastic.

22:03.018 --> 22:04.085
Can I have a coffee?

22:04.119 --> 22:07.221
No.

22:07.255 --> 22:10.958
It's not good.

22:10.992 --> 22:13.194
It's so good.

22:13.228 --> 22:14.962
Bring it down.

22:14.996 --> 22:18.466
Yeah.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.935
What? Shut up.

22:20.969 --> 22:22.970
Don't play with me, man.

22:23.004 --> 22:24.739
Are you serious?

22:24.773 --> 22:26.974
Okay, we're on our way.

22:27.008 --> 22:28.075
Cut it, cut it.

22:28.110 --> 22:28.709
We're in the middle

22:28.744 --> 22:29.276
Of a take.

22:29.311 --> 22:31.145
Cut the session, man.

22:31.179 --> 22:32.046
What happened?

22:32.080 --> 22:34.048
Are we taking a break?

22:34.082 --> 22:35.382
That was jesse.

22:35.417 --> 22:36.283
He played the song for Beyonce

22:36.318 --> 22:37.618
And she went nuts over it.

22:37.652 --> 22:38.285
Shut up.

22:38.320 --> 22:39.220
She might wanna record it.

22:39.254 --> 22:40.054
Beyonce?

22:40.088 --> 22:41.055
He's with her right now.

22:41.089 --> 22:42.289
Oh, my God!

22:42.324 --> 22:43.557
What's happening out there?

22:43.592 --> 22:44.625
Beyonce likes our song?

22:44.659 --> 22:45.760
My song.

22:45.794 --> 22:48.195
Best 500 bucks I ever spent.

22:48.196 --> 22:49.063
Hello?

22:49.097 --> 22:50.164
Come on, man.

22:50.198 --> 22:51.465
Let's go meet Beyonce.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.433
Can I come?

22:52.467 --> 22:54.068
No.

22:54.102 --> 22:54.635
But I wanna meet...

22:54.669 --> 22:56.737
Aren't you gonna...yo.

22:56.772 --> 22:59.774
Really? The lights.

22:59.808 --> 23:01.208
Guys.

23:05.377 --> 23:06.477
Going to the slap.com

23:06.511 --> 23:07.711
Is like...

23:07.746 --> 23:09.113
It's a slap.

23:09.147 --> 23:10.147
...a wonderful bowl

23:10.181 --> 23:12.349
Of hot fresh milk.

23:12.384 --> 23:15.019
The slap.com.

23:15.053 --> 23:16.587
It's like being slapped

23:16.621 --> 23:18.222
By the internet.

23:18.256 --> 23:19.223
Okay.

23:19.257 --> 23:22.593
No, that's disturbing.

23:23.461 --> 23:25.564
Can I get a rubber band?

23:32.000 --> 23:37.000
