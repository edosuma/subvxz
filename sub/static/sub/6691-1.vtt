WEBVTT

03:19.407 --> 03:21.341
It's too hot.

03:23.578 --> 03:26.809
When I get back,
I'm gonna put it...

03:29.617 --> 03:30.549
Mother?

03:30.618 --> 03:33.109
Mother's the oldest
in our squad.

03:33.187 --> 03:38.056
He just had his 26th birthday, and
two days later his baby was born dead.

03:38.126 --> 03:40.060
We call him Mother... Wilkins...

03:40.128 --> 03:42.426
because he's always hounding us
for being sloppy, bugging us...

03:42.497 --> 03:44.431
about leaving things around.

04:00.348 --> 04:02.942
They're a little bent.

04:10.725 --> 04:12.818
You want me
to turn you in, Vance?

04:14.195 --> 04:16.755
Between the stuff you did
and the stuff I make up...

04:16.831 --> 04:21.700
I could at least get you
to a psychiatrist in some hospital.

04:29.010 --> 04:30.602
Couldn't fool anybody.

04:31.412 --> 04:33.471
Wouldn't let me do
all this shit.

04:35.750 --> 04:37.684
Only you were here.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.755
Doesn't really count.

04:42.723 --> 04:46.921
You sure fooled me, Mother.
I'll tell you that.

04:47.895 --> 04:51.194
You also broke a squad rule.

04:51.265 --> 04:52.926
What rule?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.934
Well, you said "shit."

04:58.706 --> 05:00.765
What would Father say?

05:03.511 --> 05:07.140
Father Mundy invented our squad
"no obscenity"rule.

05:07.215 --> 05:10.150
We wanna make it clear
we're not actually part of this army.

05:11.485 --> 05:15.182
Yes, we have a squad father too.

05:15.256 --> 05:17.417
Mother Wilkins, Father Mundy.

05:18.759 --> 05:22.991
Father Mundy was gonna be a priest,
but never made it through the seminary.

05:26.534 --> 05:30.595
The next guard was taken by Bud Miller,
our mad mechanical genius...

05:30.671 --> 05:32.935
and resident wit...

05:33.007 --> 05:36.807
and Stan Shutzer,
our avengingJewish angel.

05:38.512 --> 05:42.744
They're supposed to be 12 in
Intelligence and Reconnaissance squads.

05:42.817 --> 05:45.012
Ours is down to six.

05:45.686 --> 05:48.655
Mel Avakian,
our best remaining soldier...

05:48.723 --> 05:52.750
became corporal to our squad
at the same time I made sergeant.

05:52.827 --> 05:54.988
It wasn't
for anything we did.

05:55.062 --> 05:57.030
Except stay alive.

05:57.098 --> 06:00.465
He hasn't sewn on
his stripes either.

06:00.534 --> 06:04.197
Our regimental commander
is Major Griffin.

06:04.272 --> 06:07.833
Griffin was a mortician
in civilian life.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.104
His main passion now
seems to be generating business...

06:10.177 --> 06:12.509
for his army counterparts.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.140
It's thanks to Griffin
and his military mortuary skills...

06:15.216 --> 06:18.652
that I've made my recent
headlong leap to three stripes.

06:18.719 --> 06:22.382
We lost half our squad, attempting one
of his map-inspired, ill-conceived...

06:22.456 --> 06:24.549
recon patrols.

06:24.625 --> 06:27.423
When I say "lost,"
I mean "killed."

06:27.495 --> 06:30.828
Nobody in the army ever admits
that someone on our side is killed.

06:30.898 --> 06:33.628
They're either lost,
like Christopher Robin...

06:36.237 --> 06:40.367
hit, as in a batter
hit by a pitched ball...

06:40.441 --> 06:45.140
or they get "it"
like in hide-and-go-seek.

06:45.212 --> 06:48.375
Or maybe they get it
as with an ambiguous joke.

06:51.018 --> 06:54.112
Not one of the six killed
had an army intelligence score...

06:54.188 --> 06:55.849
of less than 150.

06:55.923 --> 06:57.914
We gained a few miles
of European real estate...

06:57.992 --> 07:02.053
and lost the beginnings to untold
generations of very bright people.

07:02.129 --> 07:04.723
I think the army
considered this a good deal.

07:11.339 --> 07:13.864
So now we've been moved north
into the Ardennes Forest...

07:13.941 --> 07:15.875
to await replacements.

07:15.943 --> 07:17.968
It's become a kind
of frontline halfway house...

07:18.045 --> 07:19.979
for straightening out
our nerves.

07:22.516 --> 07:24.950
I'm not sure
I can be straightened out.

07:26.420 --> 07:28.445
I'm scared all the time now.

07:31.459 --> 07:34.428
It's mid-December, 1944.

07:43.604 --> 07:47.199
My family name is Knott.
K-N-O-T-T.

07:47.274 --> 07:49.799
My parents named me William.

07:49.877 --> 07:52.971
By the third grade,
I was Will Knott.

07:53.047 --> 07:54.981
I've learned to live with it.

07:55.049 --> 07:57.882
What I wasn't prepared for
were the guys of the I & Rplatoon...

07:57.952 --> 08:00.819
who decided I was
to be known as "Won't."

08:02.690 --> 08:04.624
Let's go, Knott!

08:08.763 --> 08:11.095
Back in Camp Shelby
before we shipped out...

08:11.165 --> 08:15.329
Lieutenant Ware was told that
Intelligence was doing a lousy job.

08:15.403 --> 08:18.099
He figured if he filled the squad
with intelligent soldiers...

08:18.172 --> 08:20.402
he'd get better Intelligence.

08:20.474 --> 08:23.807
He searched the regimental records for
the soldiers with the highest scores...

08:23.878 --> 08:25.812
on the intelligence test...

08:25.880 --> 08:28.610
and requisitioned us
as a squad.

08:28.682 --> 08:31.742
Of course, six of us are dead.

08:31.819 --> 08:35.778
So what's intelligence?

08:38.025 --> 08:39.515
Jesus Christ, Knott.

08:39.592 --> 08:42.357
Haven't you got them fucking
sergeant stripes sewn on yet?

08:42.429 --> 08:45.331
The supply sergeant says they're all
out. They're waiting on a new shipment.

08:45.399 --> 08:47.924
Well, get some staff sergeant
stripes and cut 'em down.

08:48.669 --> 08:50.864
That'd be destruction
of government property, sir.

08:51.772 --> 08:56.505
Well, I just hope to hell that
son of a bitch Griffin doesn't see it.

08:57.578 --> 08:59.944
It's amazing how much profanity
goes on in the army...

09:00.014 --> 09:02.346
when you're tuned to hear it.

09:09.657 --> 09:11.591
Yeah, at ease, gentlemen.

09:11.659 --> 09:13.889
Well done.
And, Corporal, if we could...

09:13.961 --> 09:15.895
I'd like the water
a little warmer tomorrow.

09:15.963 --> 09:19.330
Give that razor a fighting chance
up there against the whiskers.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.801
Okay. Lieutenant Ware,
Sergeant Knott.

09:22.870 --> 09:25.771
Gentlemen, I'd like you
to disregard...

09:25.840 --> 09:28.365
all the rumors you've been
hearing around camp lately...

09:28.442 --> 09:31.536
because now there's talk
of a imminent all-out enemy offensive.

09:31.612 --> 09:36.049
Of course, the natural route for
any such offensive in this sector...

09:36.117 --> 09:40.178
would obviously be
up these two roads...

09:40.254 --> 09:42.586
and through this path
in the forest.

09:43.657 --> 09:48.185
With that in mind,
three days ago, I sent out a patrol.

09:48.262 --> 09:51.789
Now, that patrol
has not returned...

09:51.866 --> 09:55.131
and, unfortunately,
they have not reported back.

09:56.604 --> 09:58.902
Accordingly, I've made
the following decisions.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.771
Sergeant Knott...

10:01.842 --> 10:05.243
at this particular clearing
in the forest...

10:05.312 --> 10:07.439
is a house.

10:07.515 --> 10:11.007
I'd like you to move into that house
with your reduced squad.

10:11.085 --> 10:14.179
Take yourself two jeeps
and a week's rations.

10:14.255 --> 10:15.722
And from that house...

10:15.789 --> 10:20.692
you're to report on any and all
enemy activity within that sector.

10:20.761 --> 10:22.695
Lieutenant Ware...

10:22.763 --> 10:25.061
you're to maintain constant
radio contact with Sergeant Knott.

10:25.132 --> 10:27.965
- Is that clear, gentlemen?
- Yes, sir.

10:28.035 --> 10:31.903
Sir, is there any evidence
of enemy occupation at that house?

10:33.541 --> 10:35.566
Well, now, Sergeant Knott...

10:35.643 --> 10:37.975
that's something you're just
gonna have to find out, isn't it?

10:39.380 --> 10:41.314
Right, sir.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.641
We drive for hours
through the snow.

11:09.476 --> 11:13.242
Mother and I haven't talked about our
cross-country jaunt through the woods.

11:13.314 --> 11:15.839
He just acts
as if it never happened.

11:15.916 --> 11:19.579
That's all right. Just thinking
about something like that scares me.

11:31.298 --> 11:33.323
What's going on, Mother?

11:33.400 --> 11:35.766
I don't know.
There's something up the road.

11:35.836 --> 11:39.169
- What is it?
- You can't see it from here.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.974
All right, stay here.

12:05.733 --> 12:07.667
What is it?

12:17.745 --> 12:19.679
Miller.

12:28.622 --> 12:30.556
Check it out.

12:30.624 --> 12:33.149
Why do I always have
to check it out?

13:22.409 --> 13:25.742
Jimmy Brunowski
from Griffin's patrol.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.210
Looks like
he finally found a date.

13:48.969 --> 13:51.563
I don't get it.

13:52.740 --> 13:54.674
What's going on?

13:57.144 --> 13:59.669
Those filthy, Nazi...

13:59.747 --> 14:03.649
Kraut-headed
motherfucking bastards!

14:11.125 --> 14:13.525
Give me a hand.

14:47.928 --> 14:51.022
May God have mercy
on your souls.

15:38.579 --> 15:41.605
I don't see anything.
No smoke, no movement.

15:41.682 --> 15:43.877
What do you think?
Head on up with the jeeps?

15:45.452 --> 15:47.920
Actually, I thought
maybe shoot through an eye.

15:47.988 --> 15:50.855
We head down the road a ways,
circle around the back...

15:50.924 --> 15:53.518
then come down the front of the road
and check for mines.

15:53.594 --> 15:55.789
Is that okay with you?

15:55.863 --> 15:58.832
- Yeah. We'll cover you.
- Great.

15:58.899 --> 16:01.891
If Mel hadn't gotten trench foot,
he'd sure as hell be squad leader.

16:01.969 --> 16:03.903
And that's the way
it should be.

16:03.971 --> 16:05.905
Or maybe he'd be dead.

17:06.666 --> 17:09.693
I'm not exactly sure
what country we're in.

17:09.770 --> 17:14.537
It could be Belgium,
Luxembourg, France or even Germany.

17:15.275 --> 17:19.006
I don't know what day it is. I have no
watch, so I don't know what time it is.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.945
I'm not even sure of my name.

17:22.015 --> 17:24.744
The next thing you know,
they'll be making me a general.

18:07.127 --> 18:10.062
We find four mattresses
and satin-quilted covers...

18:10.130 --> 18:13.588
along with some wine
and cases of sardines.

18:13.667 --> 18:16.192
The I & Rplatoon,
or what's left of it...

18:16.269 --> 18:19.397
will be living in luxury
for a few days.

18:19.473 --> 18:23.307
Wow. Sheets and pillows.
I haven't had that since home.

18:26.980 --> 18:30.108
Mel, come on.
Show 'em how we did it for the old USO.

18:31.184 --> 18:33.118
USO, huh?

18:38.158 --> 18:41.685
They call it
theJersey Bounce

18:41.762 --> 18:44.390
The rhythm
that really counts

18:45.832 --> 18:48.926
The temperature
always mounts

18:49.002 --> 18:52.403
Whenever they play that crazy rhythm
they play

18:52.472 --> 18:56.966
It started onJournal Square

18:57.044 --> 19:00.207
Somebody heard it there

19:01.348 --> 19:04.283
They put it
right on the air

19:05.452 --> 19:09.354
And now you hear it
everywhere

19:09.423 --> 19:11.288
Uptown

19:11.358 --> 19:13.622
Back at Camp Shelby,
when we finally realized...

19:13.694 --> 19:16.891
they really were going
to ship us overseas...

19:16.963 --> 19:18.897
we went into a mild
state of panic.

19:18.965 --> 19:21.229
The thing that
bothered us most was that...

19:21.301 --> 19:25.397
with the exception of Mother Wilkins,
we were all eleven virgins.

19:25.472 --> 19:27.406
I don't know
if this was normal...

19:27.474 --> 19:31.604
or if there's some sort of correlation
between a lack of sexual precocity...

19:31.678 --> 19:33.942
and what is known as intelligence.

19:39.853 --> 19:44.051
I think Shutzer came up with the idea.
Or maybe it was Eddie.

19:44.124 --> 19:46.592
Eddie was the youngest
of all of us.

19:46.660 --> 19:49.185
Four of us managed a weekend pass
and headed into town...

19:49.262 --> 19:52.595
to find a nice, complacent whore
who could put us out of our misery.

19:57.170 --> 20:01.607
We kept it to four. We figured any more
would be some kind of gang bang.

20:01.675 --> 20:05.634
And, well, we had
more romantic aspirations.

20:06.780 --> 20:09.977
We had fifty dollars.
We spent ten on the room...

20:10.050 --> 20:12.883
and left the rest
for the investment.

20:12.953 --> 20:16.047
There was much discussion
as to the kind of woman.

20:16.123 --> 20:19.251
I think we were all scared
that we'd end up with a real woman...

20:19.326 --> 20:21.260
and not be able to manage it.

20:21.328 --> 20:23.762
And the "B"girls
in the bars were out.

20:23.830 --> 20:26.663
We were well-conditioned
by the army VD films.

20:27.901 --> 20:30.802
Avakian and Shutzer
were to handle the search.

20:31.905 --> 20:34.339
Eddie and I waited.

20:43.517 --> 20:45.917
What time is it?

20:45.986 --> 20:48.887
- One.
- You're kidding.

21:01.668 --> 21:03.602
We got company, guys.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.373
Oh, shit.

21:10.677 --> 21:15.114
I know right then I won't
be able to do it. I'm glad I'm third.

21:32.599 --> 21:35.067
So we'd just about given up...

21:35.135 --> 21:37.603
when we see this girl
down by the bus station.

21:37.671 --> 21:40.265
Just sitting there
on one of those wooden benches.

21:40.340 --> 21:43.935
Anyway, we got around to talking
about what we'd been doing all night.

21:44.010 --> 21:46.001
And right then,
out of the blue...

21:46.079 --> 21:48.980
she just volunteered
to come back here with us.

21:49.049 --> 21:52.985
I thought she was kidding,
but she's serious.

21:53.053 --> 21:55.988
Well, I got an extra rubber
you can use if you want, Stan.

21:56.056 --> 21:57.990
I got my own rubbers.

21:58.058 --> 22:00.788
You've gotten as bad
as Mother Wilkins.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.795
Actually, I can use one.

22:11.137 --> 22:13.867
I should have known Edward
was gonna take forever.

22:20.614 --> 22:23.174
What the fuck
are they doing in there?

22:23.250 --> 22:26.219
Watch your language, Stan.
What would Father Mundy think?

22:26.286 --> 22:28.220
Fuck Father Mundy.

22:31.524 --> 22:33.924
Hey, Eddie,
how you doing in there, huh?

22:36.630 --> 22:38.723
Maybe she rolled him
or something.

22:38.798 --> 22:41.198
Knockout drops
or a blackjack.

22:49.643 --> 22:51.577
Would you at least
say something?

23:30.417 --> 23:32.681
Her name's Janice.

23:32.752 --> 23:35.186
She was engaged
to a boy named Matt.

23:36.256 --> 23:40.488
She found out last week that he was
killed in the invasion of Sicily.

23:43.096 --> 23:46.554
She came down to Shelby
to get his stuff...

23:46.633 --> 23:49.534
and decided to kill herself.

23:50.737 --> 23:54.173
But she couldn't
work up the nerve.

23:54.240 --> 23:57.368
All she has now is a bus ticket
back home to Pittsburgh.

24:08.154 --> 24:12.887
Janice has only made love
to one boy, Matt, just before he left.

24:14.194 --> 24:17.027
Now she's volunteering herself
to all of us...

24:17.097 --> 24:19.531
insisting it's what
she wants to do.

24:20.700 --> 24:22.634
Of course
we're so guilty and scared...

24:22.702 --> 24:25.500
we end up subjecting
this simple, lovely idea...

24:25.572 --> 24:29.872
to every kind
of spurious rationale.

24:32.779 --> 24:35.748
We wind down before dawn
and sleep.

24:36.816 --> 24:41.719
Then just before the morning,
Janice comes quietly...

24:41.788 --> 24:43.722
privately to each of us.

25:27.033 --> 25:29.501
We pass through
the mythical barrier...

25:29.569 --> 25:32.197
between boys and men...

25:32.272 --> 25:35.070
men and death.

25:35.141 --> 25:37.075
Janice takes us with her.

25:40.880 --> 25:43.781
After a luxurious
mass breakfast in bed...

25:43.850 --> 25:46.580
we walk Janice to her bus.

25:46.653 --> 25:48.644
None of us talk
about what happened.

25:49.823 --> 25:53.884
And I think I'll always feel strange
about my first sexual experience...

25:53.960 --> 25:56.952
masquerading as a dead boy
named Matt.

26:08.708 --> 26:10.369
- Knott.
- Yeah.

26:10.443 --> 26:13.469
I'll cook lunch if you can get me
some wood for the fireplace.

26:13.546 --> 26:16.276
No, Mother. All we need
is a bunch of smoke...

26:16.349 --> 26:18.283
to let the Germans
know we're here.

26:18.351 --> 26:21.013
Will, if we don't light a fire,
we're gonna freeze our butts off.

26:21.087 --> 26:24.488
And it's very hard to kill Germans
with a frozen butt.

26:28.995 --> 26:30.428
All right.

27:00.627 --> 27:03.221
The smoke's bad,
but not as bad as I thought.

27:17.810 --> 27:21.439
You're taking a little long putting
that back together, aren't you, Bud?

27:21.514 --> 27:23.448
I'm not working
for speed right now.

27:23.516 --> 27:25.450
This wine tastes
like sardines.

27:27.754 --> 27:30.689
Well, here. The sardines
taste sort of like wine.

27:33.293 --> 27:35.557
I sit here trying
to work out four bridge hands.

27:36.362 --> 27:40.992
Miller invented the game, calling it
"compact, cardless, duplicate bridge."

27:48.274 --> 27:52.438
When we lost half the squad,
we also lost our only deck of cards.

27:52.512 --> 27:54.446
They were on Eddie.

27:56.849 --> 27:59.340
He died in the field hospital.

27:59.419 --> 28:02.980
With his left arm gone
and his face the way it was...

28:03.056 --> 28:05.490
I don't think he tried
very hard to stay on.

29:07.587 --> 29:09.521
Hi, Bud.

29:10.757 --> 29:14.625
Did Mother and Avakian
set up all right down there?

29:14.694 --> 29:16.753
They seemed fine to me.

29:16.829 --> 29:20.560
Good. Listen. You have got to be more
careful lighting cigarettes, all right?

29:20.633 --> 29:23.727
Some German could sneak up from
behind you, pop one in your head...

29:23.803 --> 29:25.896
while you're pretending
to be Walt Whitman.

29:28.574 --> 29:30.599
I think my eyeball's frozen.

29:36.849 --> 29:38.783
- Yeah?
- Is that you, Will?

29:38.851 --> 29:42.981
- Yeah. What's going on?
- I don't know. I think I saw something.

29:43.056 --> 29:46.025
- What did you see, Mother?
- I'm not sure, Will.

29:46.793 --> 29:51.628
I don't know. I think I saw something
move on the hill across from us.

29:51.698 --> 29:54.030
Did Avakian see it?

29:54.100 --> 29:56.432
No. Just me.

29:56.502 --> 29:59.596
All right, Mother, hang tight.
I'll call up top.

29:59.672 --> 30:01.606
Oh, shit.

30:04.610 --> 30:05.702
- Father?
- Yeah?

30:05.778 --> 30:08.941
Yeah. Mother says he saw something
on the opposite hill there.

30:09.015 --> 30:11.882
- Did you see anything?
- No. Nothing.

30:11.951 --> 30:15.409
Wilkins must have eyes like an owl.
I can't see my hand in front of my face.

30:15.488 --> 30:18.924
All right.
Could be he's only jumpy.

30:18.991 --> 30:21.357
Just keep an eye
on their backs, all right?

30:21.427 --> 30:24.021
Okay, Will.

30:24.097 --> 30:26.531
Hey, Bud. Relax. Relax.

30:26.599 --> 30:30.501
Mother's pretty nervous.
It's probably nothing.

30:30.570 --> 30:34.529
Probably nothing?
That's real reassuring, Will.

30:36.008 --> 30:37.942
Well, what do you think?

30:39.011 --> 30:41.536
I don't know.

30:41.614 --> 30:44.879
Maybe I should tell them
about Mother's run through the woods.

30:44.951 --> 30:47.613
The news of his baby being dead
did him in for sure.

31:03.002 --> 31:06.460
- Yeah?
- We're hearing something down here.

31:06.539 --> 31:08.973
Mother thinks it's the Germans
signaling back and forth.

31:09.041 --> 31:11.509
All right, Mel, hold on.
We'll be right down.

31:11.577 --> 31:13.807
- Bud. Bud, wake up.
- What?

31:13.880 --> 31:16.713
Listen. Mel says he's
hearing some noises, all right?

31:16.783 --> 31:20.241
I want you to call Shutzer, tell him
I'm going down to the lower post.

31:20.319 --> 31:23.686
Then call Mother and Avakian back and
remind them not to shoot me, all right?

31:23.756 --> 31:25.155
Come on. Get up.

31:28.795 --> 31:30.228
Go!

31:40.339 --> 31:42.671
Did you hear any more?

31:42.742 --> 31:44.676
Not since the last one.

31:52.852 --> 31:54.786
It's closer that time.

32:27.386 --> 32:29.320
Americana.

32:33.659 --> 32:35.889
Easy, Mother. Easy.

33:02.054 --> 33:03.919
What do you think?
Maybe they're gone?

33:07.360 --> 33:08.793
I don't know.

33:08.861 --> 33:11.557
Maybe they're
just being quiet.

33:19.105 --> 33:21.665
Mel.

33:21.741 --> 33:24.505
Let's you and me go
check out the road, all right?

33:24.577 --> 33:29.173
Hey, Will, you go if you want.
I'm fine right here.

33:29.248 --> 33:31.478
If they're gone, they're gone.

33:31.551 --> 33:33.485
If they're not,
I'm not walking into an ambush.

33:42.828 --> 33:45.353
Put that pin
back in that grenade.

33:53.606 --> 33:55.870
- No, it wasn't.
- They do shit like this all the time.

33:55.942 --> 33:59.605
- I know, but that wasn't the case.
- How do you know?

33:59.679 --> 34:01.943
Do you think
it was five of'em?

34:07.987 --> 34:10.251
- Yeah, yeah.
- What the hell is going on?

34:10.322 --> 34:13.224
Mel said they were actually talking
to you. What did they say?

34:13.292 --> 34:17.728
I don't know. First it was,
"Hey, Americana."

34:17.797 --> 34:21.130
Then when they left, they started
saying something like "slap guder."

34:23.168 --> 34:25.103
It didn't make any sense.

34:29.475 --> 34:32.409
Shit, that's Yiddish.
It's schlaf gut.

34:32.478 --> 34:34.411
It's "sleep well."

34:35.848 --> 34:37.281
"Sleep well"?

34:37.350 --> 34:40.683
Yeah, Will. "Sleep well."
Get it?

34:41.754 --> 34:45.746
Holy shit. These fucking Nazis.
They're softening us up for the kill.

34:53.399 --> 34:54.866
Will, wake up.

34:57.003 --> 34:59.597
Ware's on the phone.
He doesn't sound real happy.

35:09.749 --> 35:12.377
- Is Mother out there alone?
- Yeah.

35:12.451 --> 35:15.113
- Why?
- Why? It's the day.

35:15.187 --> 35:18.122
You don't need to leave two guys out
there during the day. What's the point?

35:18.190 --> 35:20.181
I don't know, Bud.
How about the Germans?

35:20.259 --> 35:22.454
What do you want, Will?
You wanna lose one guy, two guys?

35:22.528 --> 35:27.329
I'm just really glad we talked about
this. I'm glad we could work this out.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.833
Shit.

35:30.636 --> 35:32.729
It's up to you, Bud.
Bid or pass?

35:32.805 --> 35:34.739
I pass.

35:34.807 --> 35:37.105
Able 1 to Able 4. Over.

35:40.379 --> 35:44.440
I tell Ware about our nighttime
encounter with the Germans.

35:44.517 --> 35:46.007
Bad idea.

35:46.085 --> 35:48.019
Griffin's desperate
for information...

35:48.087 --> 35:51.386
so Ware orders us out
to find their command post.

35:51.457 --> 35:53.391
We decided to head south
down the pass.

35:53.459 --> 35:56.656
It's as good a guess as any, and that's
where their voices seem to come from.

35:57.296 --> 36:00.697
Of course that could be seen as a good
argument for heading the other way.

36:11.510 --> 36:13.842
I'm having my usual trouble...

36:13.913 --> 36:17.440
noticing how beautiful the world is
just when I might be leaving it.

36:46.746 --> 36:48.680
Just this side of the road.

37:13.139 --> 37:15.198
Don't worry.

37:15.274 --> 37:18.801
I'm just enjoying having
a fucking Nazi in my sights.

37:20.513 --> 37:22.947
I think I'm getting a hard-on.

37:27.086 --> 37:28.519
Pow!

37:44.603 --> 37:48.835
I know we could've killed
those three guys and gotten away.

37:48.908 --> 37:52.844
I'm also sure they could've done
the same thing to us last night.

37:54.513 --> 37:57.949
What I don't know in both cases
is why it didn't happen.

38:35.721 --> 38:37.814
Shit!

38:37.890 --> 38:40.791
Fuck! Here we fucking go!

38:42.795 --> 38:46.526
You're gonna get us killed here.
You got to relax.

38:46.599 --> 38:51.502
I said you got to relax.
You gotta shut up. You gotta shut up.

38:51.570 --> 38:55.301
- Shut up, Stan!
- You're gonna get us all killed.

38:55.374 --> 38:58.172
You're gonna get us all killed.
You gotta shut up!

38:58.244 --> 39:00.303
Stan! You gotta...

39:31.877 --> 39:33.811
Come on!

39:43.789 --> 39:45.723
What happened?

39:47.359 --> 39:50.522
- You find any Germans?
- Yeah, we found them all right.

39:50.596 --> 39:54.623
And they found us.
Krauts nearly blew our heads off.

39:56.068 --> 39:58.002
Oh, shit.

39:59.071 --> 40:01.005
I lost the scope and the map.

40:01.073 --> 40:03.735
Great. Injury to insult.

40:03.809 --> 40:06.710
- What happened, Bud?
- What happened?

40:06.779 --> 40:08.747
Germans found us,
had a dead in their sights.

40:08.814 --> 40:11.749
They could've killed all of us
and they just let us go.

40:11.817 --> 40:16.516
- That's what happened.
- They had you and then they let you go?

40:16.588 --> 40:18.522
What are you complaining about?
You should be happy.

40:20.159 --> 40:22.491
We should be happy?

40:22.561 --> 40:24.825
Oh, okay, Mundy, we're happy.

40:24.897 --> 40:28.094
We're happy! Yippee!
Hooray!

40:28.167 --> 40:30.499
You feel better now?

40:30.569 --> 40:32.503
All right, Stan, come on.

40:38.310 --> 40:41.871
- What the hell is that?
- That's just Mother.

40:41.947 --> 40:44.882
Clumping around in the attic again.
It's fine.

40:55.761 --> 40:59.162
- Did you find the stuff?
- They must've come back after we left.

40:59.231 --> 41:02.723
There's all kind of tracks.
They took the scope and the map.

41:12.044 --> 41:15.172
What did you do? Crawl around
on your hands and knees looking for it?

41:15.247 --> 41:19.115
No. I could see right off
the stuff wasn't there.

41:19.184 --> 41:23.780
I got wet working out a little
surprise for our Teutonic friends.

41:23.856 --> 41:25.847
What, a trap?

41:28.727 --> 41:30.661
I built a snowman.

41:32.064 --> 41:34.362
Right where
we dropped our stuff.

41:34.433 --> 41:36.560
I used pine needles
for a mustache.

41:36.635 --> 41:40.127
And then a branch,
like an arm giving the Nazi salute.

41:40.205 --> 41:43.732
I even put a few
pine branches over one eye.

41:43.809 --> 41:46.243
- It's not a bad resemblance.
- Jesus, Stan.

41:46.311 --> 41:49.508
They could've come up from behind, made
a few well placed critical comments...

41:49.581 --> 41:51.515
and one more
ventilated whiz kid.

41:55.554 --> 41:58.785
Even stamped out a message
in front of my snowman.

41:58.857 --> 42:00.415
What?

42:00.492 --> 42:03.290
F-U-C-K...

42:03.362 --> 42:07.128
H-l-T-L-E-R.

42:08.367 --> 42:11.029
Made exclamation points
with pine branches.

42:31.156 --> 42:35.217
- Where's Mother?
- He's upstairs in his attic.

42:36.061 --> 42:39.929
- What's he doing there?
- I have no idea, Will.

42:41.834 --> 42:44.462
Actually, he's been kind
of quiet lately.

42:44.536 --> 42:47.562
Maybe he hung himself,
huh, Father?

43:31.617 --> 43:33.915
Are you all right, Mother?

43:37.356 --> 43:39.290
Look at the paintings, Will.

43:43.795 --> 43:45.228
Look.

43:51.904 --> 43:53.963
See?

43:55.807 --> 43:57.741
Somebody cared.

44:02.814 --> 44:04.907
Somebody made something...

44:07.419 --> 44:10.286
probably not even for money.

44:12.658 --> 44:14.592
For love.

44:16.828 --> 44:20.821
Sometimes I didn't believe
there was any love left.

44:27.172 --> 44:30.573
Try to remember
who the real enemy is, Will.

44:54.433 --> 44:57.891
Christ, I thought we lost
both of you up there.

44:57.970 --> 45:00.165
What did you do,
start a family?

45:01.840 --> 45:03.364
Father, you're on next.

45:03.442 --> 45:05.069
Unless anyone objects, Bud...

45:05.143 --> 45:08.806
I think we should go back to at least
two on the lower post for now.

45:08.880 --> 45:10.814
All right?

45:12.017 --> 45:14.349
It's too weird out there
for one guy alone.

45:54.393 --> 45:55.883
Shit!

46:08.173 --> 46:10.107
What the hell's going on?

46:10.175 --> 46:13.372
The explosion was me throwing a grenade.
They haven't fired back yet.

46:19.117 --> 46:20.379
Can you hear that?

46:22.521 --> 46:23.954
Can you hear that?

46:24.022 --> 46:27.253
We can hear without the phone.
What are they yelling about now?

46:27.326 --> 46:30.489
I think they're yelling "Fuck Hitler"
the way your grandmother would say it.

46:30.562 --> 46:34.589
There's this crazy guy in the cemetery,
pretending grenades don't hurt.

46:34.666 --> 46:36.634
Maybe you should send out
some straitjackets.

46:36.702 --> 46:37.634
Grenade!

47:17.242 --> 47:18.402
Shit.

47:39.464 --> 47:42.228
- We're having a snowball fight.
- What?

47:42.300 --> 47:45.701
You don't think maybe the war's over
and they're not telling us, do you?

47:45.771 --> 47:48.137
- I mean, they wouldn't do that.
- You sure you're okay down there?

47:48.206 --> 47:52.108
Goddamn it, Shutzer! You're the one
that started this "Fuck Hitler" shit.

48:00.051 --> 48:02.019
Schlaf gut, Kraut.

48:41.493 --> 48:43.154
You got that map?

48:44.229 --> 48:45.662
Yeah.

49:02.581 --> 49:05.641
I'll be a son of a bitch.

49:05.717 --> 49:07.241
What?

49:07.319 --> 49:10.311
I've been trying to figure out all
this crazy shit that's been going on...

49:10.388 --> 49:13.653
for the past couple of days,
and only one answer makes sense.

49:17.162 --> 49:19.858
Remember the frozen American
and the Kraut dancing together?

49:19.931 --> 49:22.456
See, it's like a message.
They wanna get together.

49:22.534 --> 49:25.196
- It's crude, but remember who they are.
- So?

49:25.270 --> 49:28.569
So then they come around with that
schlaf gut bit the first night.

49:28.640 --> 49:30.835
It's like they're saying
they know that we're here...

49:30.909 --> 49:32.843
but they're not
so mad about it.

49:35.280 --> 49:38.147
- Yeah.
- Well, listen.

49:38.216 --> 49:42.346
Okay. Just try to think of one reason
they didn't mow us down...

49:42.420 --> 49:45.685
or at least take us prisoner.

49:45.757 --> 49:48.225
I think they're telling us
that they wanna talk...

49:48.293 --> 49:50.318
maybe even surrender.

49:51.730 --> 49:53.459
- What?
- If I'm right...

49:53.532 --> 49:56.763
they want us to meet them
in this clearing at 1200 hours.

49:56.835 --> 49:58.564
What if it's a trap?

49:58.637 --> 50:01.003
If they wanted to kill us,
they could've done it a couple of times.

50:01.072 --> 50:04.940
We could've shot them. We didn't.
That doesn't mean we wanna surrender.

50:05.010 --> 50:06.944
They could be stalling
for reinforcements.

50:07.012 --> 50:08.980
With a snowball fight?

50:09.047 --> 50:10.981
A snowball fight
doesn't mean surrender.

50:11.049 --> 50:13.313
Yeah, but look at this.

50:15.320 --> 50:18.255
- I'll mention it to Ware.
- Come on, Won't.

50:18.323 --> 50:22.987
We don't wanna get officers involved
in this, screwing everything up.

50:23.061 --> 50:26.656
You know,
I think we got a chance...

50:26.731 --> 50:28.858
to make something good
come out of this for everybody...

50:28.934 --> 50:31.664
if we just use our heads.

50:31.736 --> 50:35.035
What do you say we just go out there
and see what's going on?

50:35.106 --> 50:37.438
Just the two of us.
I'll take all the risks.

50:37.509 --> 50:42.469
- I still say I should call Ware first.
- What do you think Ware is gonna do?

50:42.547 --> 50:44.742
- He'll tell Griffin.
- And you know damn well...

50:44.816 --> 50:46.943
that Griffin is gonna come charging
out here and arrange everything...

50:47.018 --> 50:49.486
so he looks like General Patton
winning the war single-handed.

50:49.554 --> 50:52.648
That's the way it is, Stan. There's
nothing we're gonna do about that.

51:13.239 --> 51:18.677
Suppose that one of us captures all
the Germans single-handed, all alone...

51:18.745 --> 51:22.875
then we build this guy
into a second Sergeant York?

51:22.949 --> 51:26.214
It's got to be worth
at least a Silver Star.

51:26.286 --> 51:29.619
Maybe even a trip home
as a returning war hero.

51:29.689 --> 51:32.249
- How does that sound?
- Sounds like a court-martial.

51:32.325 --> 51:34.623
How are they ever
gonna catch on?

51:34.694 --> 51:37.925
You know, for Mother's sake,
I think we should at least try.

51:37.997 --> 51:39.828
For Mother?

51:39.899 --> 51:42.459
Sure. Who else?

51:45.472 --> 51:47.906
Oh, boy, that would be perfect.

51:52.278 --> 51:54.872
We testify that the Germans
had us pinned down...

51:54.948 --> 51:57.644
and Wilkins comes in the nick
of time and saves the whole show.

51:57.717 --> 52:01.847
And we'd have a genuine mob
of enemy soldiers to back up our story.

52:01.921 --> 52:04.651
Yeah, okay. For right now
we don't tell anybody, okay?

52:04.724 --> 52:06.851
It's just the two of us.

52:06.926 --> 52:10.589
Look, if it doesn't work,
at least we tried.

52:14.601 --> 52:15.932
Sneaking out is easy.

52:16.002 --> 52:17.993
Mother's back upstairs
by himself...

52:18.071 --> 52:20.437
and Father and Miller
are asleep.

52:20.507 --> 52:24.603
We decide we'll have to tell Avakian,
who's on guard at the lower post.

52:24.677 --> 52:27.237
You're gonna tromp out there,
set up an armistice conference...

52:27.313 --> 52:29.281
and turn Wilkins
into a war hero.

52:29.349 --> 52:31.283
What, are you
out of your tiny minds?

52:31.351 --> 52:34.081
- I don't think so.
- It all makes sense.

52:34.154 --> 52:38.614
It's a theory. You're gonna get
your butt shot off for a theory.

52:38.691 --> 52:40.886
Well, I'm going.

52:40.960 --> 52:44.487
Will, listen to me.
I'm the one guy here who knows...

52:44.564 --> 52:46.657
Mel, I said I'm going.

52:52.138 --> 52:53.696
Okay, fine.

52:56.442 --> 52:58.433
But even if you do
pull this off...

52:58.511 --> 53:00.706
how are you going to get
Mother to go along with it?

53:02.549 --> 53:07.077
- We tell him?
- No. No, he's right.

53:07.153 --> 53:09.986
We'll have to draw straws
or something and rig it.

53:10.056 --> 53:12.581
Wilkins will never accept it
if he thinks it's charity.

53:12.659 --> 53:15.594
Plus, you tell him,
he's gonna want to tag along.

53:15.662 --> 53:18.563
I don't think you want Mother
facing any Germans.

53:23.269 --> 53:25.260
So what do you think, Sarge?

53:25.972 --> 53:30.602
It's then I tell them about Mother's run
through the forest back at headquarters.

53:32.679 --> 53:35.113
I don't think
we should tell him.

53:35.181 --> 53:37.342
Okay, look, when we go
to get the Krauts...

53:37.417 --> 53:39.578
we'll leave Wilkins here to guard
the chateau and mind the radio.

53:39.652 --> 53:43.816
- It's all gonna seem perfectly natural.
- What makes you so sure this will work?

53:43.890 --> 53:46.120
What makes you
so sure it's not?

53:51.264 --> 53:52.925
Okay, fine.

53:52.999 --> 53:55.797
Give two quick shots and one more
if you need any help.

53:55.869 --> 53:57.928
Then what?

54:01.107 --> 54:02.665
Then I'll miss you.

54:12.986 --> 54:16.217
Hey, have fun, boys.
Don't get killed.

55:11.177 --> 55:12.974
Hey, just calm down!

55:49.315 --> 55:52.079
They want to talk
to our officer in charge.

55:52.151 --> 55:55.120
- I don't speak German or Yiddish.
- It's okay. I'll translate.

55:55.188 --> 55:57.486
I don't have stripes on my arm.
They won't believe I'm an officer.

55:57.557 --> 56:00.048
I just don't think they're very happy
about surrendering to a Jew, okay?

56:00.126 --> 56:02.185
Did they say
they want to surrender?

56:02.261 --> 56:04.695
Just stuff about wanting
to talk to our officer in charge.

56:05.732 --> 56:08.599
- What was all the yelling about?
- I'm not sure.

56:08.668 --> 56:11.364
- You're not sure?
- Look!

56:11.437 --> 56:13.405
I'm doing the best I can, okay?

56:14.440 --> 56:18.809
Look, just...
Just come over with me.

56:18.878 --> 56:23.212
I'll tell them our officer's
back at the chateau.

56:23.282 --> 56:27.048
You look goy enough. Maybe they'll
come out more with you around.

56:27.120 --> 56:29.054
Okay? Come on.

56:36.662 --> 56:39.654
This is, uh, meine friend.
Freund.

56:44.303 --> 56:46.294
He's in the "schtieb,"
you know?

57:17.036 --> 57:20.938
Okay, I think I got it.
There's seven of them.

57:21.007 --> 57:23.498
They just got sent back
from the Russian front...

57:23.576 --> 57:26.067
where it sounds like they got
the shit knocked out of'em.

57:26.145 --> 57:28.807
He keeps talking about that
big offensive south of here...

57:28.881 --> 57:30.815
and he doesn't want
any part of it.

57:30.883 --> 57:33.044
They think the war's almost over
and they don't want to get killed...

57:33.119 --> 57:36.054
in the last few days.

57:36.122 --> 57:39.819
I told him we'd bring our leader here
tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

57:39.892 --> 57:42.417
We're going
to bring Ware here?

57:42.495 --> 57:45.191
Look, just get Mother
out on guard duty...

57:45.264 --> 57:47.255
and get the squad together,
all right?

57:47.333 --> 57:50.097
What are we gonna do
about an officer?

57:50.169 --> 57:50.303
I don't know about this.
Why can't Will just do it?

57:50.303 --> 57:53.204
I don't know about this.
Why can't Will just do it?

57:53.272 --> 57:55.433
- He's the leader, for Christ's sake.
- They've already seen him.

57:55.508 --> 57:59.137
Besides, no Kraut's ever gonna believe
that a guy like Will is an officer.

57:59.212 --> 58:01.305
- Take a look at him.
- Thank you, thank you.

58:01.380 --> 58:03.678
Then let's let Mel just do it.
He's a natural leader type.

58:03.749 --> 58:06.809
Hey, wait a second. I'm not even sure
I want to be part of this plan.

58:06.886 --> 58:09.013
Besides, I don't look
like an Aryan god.

58:09.689 --> 58:13.216
What is this?
Father, it's all stripes and no rocker.

58:13.292 --> 58:17.251
- What's that mean?
- It's something new, Miller.

58:17.330 --> 58:21.664
You're our bastard sergeant minor.
Besides, we don't have any rockers.

58:21.734 --> 58:23.793
What if it's like some kind of...

58:23.870 --> 58:26.532
"capture the commander" scheme
the Krauts have worked out?

58:26.606 --> 58:29.040
You know, put a bullet in my head
or something.

58:31.911 --> 58:34.379
Hey, look, Bud, why don't you
just try walking now?

58:36.849 --> 58:41.343
- The man walks like a soldier.
- Put more pigheaded asshole into it.

58:41.420 --> 58:43.445
- That I can do.
- Chest out, chest out.

58:43.523 --> 58:46.356
Yeah, that's it!
That'll do just fine.

58:46.425 --> 58:48.484
Just stand there like an SOB
and nod occasionally.

58:48.561 --> 58:50.495
You know, you actually do
look like an officer.

58:50.563 --> 58:53.896
- I actually feel like an asshole.
- That's about the same thing.

58:53.966 --> 58:55.957
Mother gets off post in five minutes.

58:56.035 --> 58:58.970
- Let's not blow his Christmas present.
- Sure this is a good idea?

59:05.077 --> 59:07.671
I can't stop worrying.

59:07.747 --> 59:10.375
God, I hope we're doing
the right thing.

59:16.622 --> 59:18.556
- Yeah.
- Will, listen.

59:18.624 --> 59:21.457
There are five or six of them
down here working like crazy.

59:21.527 --> 59:24.428
They got something big with them.
Could be a mortar.

59:24.497 --> 59:26.863
I think maybe you better have somebody
man that upper post to cover us.

59:26.933 --> 59:29.401
Shit. Mel, you and Mother
go up to the upper post.

59:29.468 --> 59:31.436
Stan says they're
setting up a mortar.

59:33.673 --> 59:38.042
All right. Listen. Mother and Avakian
are going to the upper post.

59:38.110 --> 59:39.441
You want me down there?

01:00:10.476 --> 01:00:12.068
- Father?
- Yeah, Will.

01:00:12.144 --> 01:00:14.942
Get your butt down here.
You of all people shouldn't miss this.

01:01:18.878 --> 01:01:22.780
Bethlehem

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:27.515
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

01:01:29.855 --> 01:01:34.019
For you. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

01:01:36.562 --> 01:01:38.029
Merry Christmas.

01:01:44.236 --> 01:01:46.261
Merry Christmas
Happy New Year.

01:01:53.746 --> 01:01:55.839
Thank you.
Merry Christmas.

01:02:14.467 --> 01:02:16.401
Merry Christmas.

01:02:33.152 --> 01:02:37.452
Holy night

01:02:37.523 --> 01:02:41.755
All is calm

01:02:41.827 --> 01:02:45.285
All is bright

01:02:45.364 --> 01:02:49.698
Round yon virgin

01:02:49.769 --> 01:02:53.330
Mother and child

01:02:53.406 --> 01:02:57.274
Holy infant

01:02:57.343 --> 01:02:59.971
- So tender and mild
- Merry Christmas.

01:03:00.045 --> 01:03:02.513
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

01:03:02.581 --> 01:03:10.113
Sleep in heavenly peace

01:03:10.189 --> 01:03:17.357
Sleep in heavenly peace

01:03:26.605 --> 01:03:30.803
O come ye
O come ye

01:03:30.876 --> 01:03:35.279
To Bethlehem

01:03:35.347 --> 01:03:37.941
Hey, Father, they teach you
German in the seminary?

01:03:38.017 --> 01:03:41.043
What the hell were you two
talking about?

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.556
I just kept saying "Merry Christmas"
and "Happy New Year."

01:03:44.623 --> 01:03:47.319
I said it maybe 50 times.

01:03:47.393 --> 01:03:50.055
- What did he say to you?
- Well...

01:03:50.129 --> 01:03:53.496
he said something
that sounded like...

01:03:53.566 --> 01:03:56.399
"Throw me a why not."

01:03:56.469 --> 01:04:01.338
And then, when he tried
to hand me his gun, he said...

01:04:01.407 --> 01:04:05.002
"Why not go shrink."

01:04:05.077 --> 01:04:07.637
"Frohlich Weihnachten"
is "Merry Christmas..."

01:04:07.713 --> 01:04:11.012
and "Weihnachtsgeschenk"
is "Christmas present."

01:04:12.451 --> 01:04:15.045
I wonder what the Germans
thought Father was saying.

01:04:17.389 --> 01:04:20.153
What's going on?

01:04:20.226 --> 01:04:23.491
Couldn't get anybody
to answer the phone.

01:04:23.562 --> 01:04:26.395
Oh, my God.
Mother, I'm sorry.

01:04:26.465 --> 01:04:28.797
I forgot all about you
up there.

01:04:32.872 --> 01:04:35.136
I...

01:04:35.207 --> 01:04:37.300
I heard singing.

01:04:38.511 --> 01:04:41.446
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

01:04:41.514 --> 01:04:44.005
The Germans just wanted
to spread a little holiday cheer.

01:04:44.083 --> 01:04:46.051
Father even did some
present exchanging.

01:04:46.118 --> 01:04:48.052
They gave us sausages,
Vance.

01:04:51.257 --> 01:04:54.454
- Is that what happened, Will?
- Yeah, that's it.

01:04:54.527 --> 01:04:56.461
This particular branch
of the German army...

01:04:56.529 --> 01:05:00.329
seems to believe in turning off
the war every once in a while.

01:05:14.613 --> 01:05:17.514
I don't know if I can take
this kind of war.

01:05:17.583 --> 01:05:21.144
I'd rather we kept out of each other's
way, except when we have to fight.

01:05:59.224 --> 01:06:01.317
Oh, shit.

01:06:08.734 --> 01:06:11.066
This is meine kommandier.

01:06:18.777 --> 01:06:20.938
Hey, Will, come over here.

01:06:21.013 --> 01:06:24.039
Okay. Okay,
they do want to surrender.

01:06:24.116 --> 01:06:27.279
As soon as possible.
Today. They...

01:06:27.353 --> 01:06:31.483
He's convinced that this German push
is coming through here any time now.

01:06:31.557 --> 01:06:33.718
There's a kicker.

01:06:34.593 --> 01:06:36.925
It's a big kicker.

01:06:36.996 --> 01:06:39.487
The young ones are scared shitless
that if the Germans come through here...

01:06:39.565 --> 01:06:42.125
and it looks like they
surrendered without a struggle...

01:06:42.201 --> 01:06:45.068
it's gonna be taken out
on their families.

01:06:45.137 --> 01:06:48.732
Everything is nuts back home and they
don't want their parents to get shot...

01:06:48.807 --> 01:06:51.332
or put in camps because
their sons were cowards.

01:06:52.645 --> 01:06:54.636
Well, do they have a suggestion?

01:06:55.481 --> 01:06:57.210
Yeah.

01:07:00.886 --> 01:07:02.854
They want us to take 'em
in a fake skirmish.

01:07:02.921 --> 01:07:03.979
What?

01:07:04.056 --> 01:07:07.822
Just make some noise, leave some
spent cartridges, grenade fragments.

01:07:07.893 --> 01:07:09.884
No. No, absolutely not.

01:07:09.962 --> 01:07:12.021
- Will...
- No! It doesn't make any sense.

01:07:12.097 --> 01:07:14.190
Just calm down. Now you're gonna
blow the whole operation here.

01:07:14.266 --> 01:07:16.564
- It's crazy!
- Be quiet! Quiet!

01:07:16.635 --> 01:07:18.068
- Shut up!
- You wanna get us killed?

01:07:18.137 --> 01:07:20.230
We're not gonna do it!
And don't tell me to shut up!

01:07:26.478 --> 01:07:29.879
Will, I know it sounds nuts,
I know, but...

01:07:29.948 --> 01:07:32.007
I think it's the only way
they're gonna go for it.

01:07:33.152 --> 01:07:34.915
They're just kids.
They're just scared.

01:07:34.987 --> 01:07:37.217
They're just scared kids.
Look at 'em.

01:07:40.459 --> 01:07:42.927
I don't know.

01:07:42.995 --> 01:07:45.589
You trust these
fuckin' Nazis, Stan?

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:50.693
- What does that mean?
- He said they're not Nazis.

01:07:50.769 --> 01:07:55.263
They're just regular German army.
They're regular army like we are.

01:08:02.981 --> 01:08:04.972
I say we do it.

01:08:05.050 --> 01:08:08.451
What if it's a trap?

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:12.581
It's not much of a trap, having us
both come fully armed to a skirmish.

01:08:12.658 --> 01:08:15.821
I mean, at best, it's just
mutual suicide, right?

01:08:15.894 --> 01:08:17.953
What if they're using the noise
to bring in reinforcements?

01:08:20.099 --> 01:08:23.466
No. If they wanted to do that,
they could've done that the first night.

01:08:23.535 --> 01:08:26.834
He's right, Will, he's right.
And take a look at 'em.

01:08:26.904 --> 01:08:31.238
Things must be bad in the vaterland
to have an army of old men and boys.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:45.581
- Okay, what do we do?
- Just give a little nod.

01:08:47.926 --> 01:08:49.917
We agree to come
this afternoon...

01:08:49.995 --> 01:08:53.953
make a lot of noise with rifles
and grenades and take them in.

01:08:54.032 --> 01:08:58.024
Able 1 to Able 4, over.
Able 1 to Able 4, over.

01:08:58.103 --> 01:09:00.162
Yeah, you got anything yet, over?

01:09:00.238 --> 01:09:04.335
Yes, sir, I think we're gonna
be able to take a prisoner, sir.

01:09:04.408 --> 01:09:06.843
We found some tracks.
Our plan is to hit their outpost...

01:09:06.912 --> 01:09:09.038
around 3:00 this afternoon.

01:09:09.113 --> 01:09:11.844
- Over.
- Good. Do it.

01:09:11.917 --> 01:09:15.546
I'll come out. Maybe Griffin too.
We'll bring the prisoner back. Over.

01:09:16.755 --> 01:09:19.019
No, sir, I don't think
that's necessary, sir.

01:09:19.091 --> 01:09:21.024
Tell Major Griffin that...

01:09:21.093 --> 01:09:23.027
No sense in him taking the risk
coming all the way out here.

01:09:23.095 --> 01:09:25.325
We'll have the jeeps ready
with the chains...

01:09:25.397 --> 01:09:27.365
and we'll get that prisoner
to you, sir, over.

01:09:27.432 --> 01:09:29.366
- I'll tell him.
- Over and out.

01:09:29.434 --> 01:09:31.368
Over and out.

01:09:34.673 --> 01:09:37.801
I tell Mother we're going out
to try for a prisoner.

01:09:37.876 --> 01:09:42.404
I tell him if we're not back in
two hours to call Ware at the base.

01:09:42.481 --> 01:09:45.712
He's obviously glad
not to be on the patrol.

01:09:45.783 --> 01:09:50.483
We hide Miller's officer outfit
under his snow poncho.

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:58.587
Now what? Walk down there
and knock on the door?

01:09:59.865 --> 01:10:02.732
Well...

01:10:02.801 --> 01:10:05.736
here I go.

01:10:05.804 --> 01:10:07.863
I'm not sure what to do
so they don't shoot me.

01:10:09.107 --> 01:10:11.598
- Try yelling "comrade."
- Is that it?

01:10:11.677 --> 01:10:14.305
Well, Stan, you could
wave a white flag.

01:10:14.379 --> 01:10:16.574
Then it would look like
the wrong group was surrendering.

01:10:20.152 --> 01:10:23.087
We're right here covering you.
Good luck.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.428
Oh, boy.

01:11:05.931 --> 01:11:09.128
We wait.
There's nothing else to do.

01:11:49.474 --> 01:11:51.704
- What's going on? Everything all right?
- Yeah.

01:11:51.777 --> 01:11:54.837
He wanted to talk to our officer
"Herr Muller" here.

01:11:54.913 --> 01:11:57.143
You know, I'm sure
it's because I'm a Jew.

01:11:57.215 --> 01:12:01.447
All right, you nick-prickJew-type,
take me to my Aryan friends.

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.511
All right,
if they're really giving up...

01:12:03.588 --> 01:12:05.783
why are they
putting a guy on post?

01:12:05.857 --> 01:12:07.916
Who are they
guarding themselves from?

01:12:09.628 --> 01:12:11.721
Maybe other Germans.

01:12:11.797 --> 01:12:13.856
They probably have
a Major Griffin of their own.

01:12:13.932 --> 01:12:17.424
Ubergruppenfuhrer Griftoch
or something.

01:12:17.502 --> 01:12:19.629
Don't worry.

01:12:19.705 --> 01:12:21.730
Come on.

01:12:43.628 --> 01:12:47.223
- That's nice.
- Okay, here's how it's gonna work.

01:12:47.299 --> 01:12:51.360
They'll wind up in front of the cabin.
Miller and I will stay as protection.

01:12:51.436 --> 01:12:53.904
All right, now, you go on out
with the rest of the squad.

01:12:53.972 --> 01:12:56.770
When old Shickelgruber here and I
signal, we all start firing.

01:12:56.842 --> 01:12:58.901
When we signal again,
we all stop.

01:12:58.977 --> 01:13:03.038
Then you guys come down the hill,
we disarm them and take them in.

01:13:03.115 --> 01:13:06.949
All we need is a nod from Miller
and they'll get their stuff together.

01:13:35.647 --> 01:13:38.275
Dismiss me.
I'll go inform Father and Mel.

01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:40.875
- What?
- Dismiss me.

01:13:43.155 --> 01:13:48.149
Will, why don't you get up on that hill
and go inform Father and Will... Mel.

01:15:25.257 --> 01:15:28.488
Mother!
Hold your fire!

01:15:52.984 --> 01:15:54.918
Go check on
Shutzer and Miller.

01:15:58.657 --> 01:16:01.592
Hang in there, Father.

01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:04.561
We're gonna get you wrapped up
and get you outta here.

01:16:08.099 --> 01:16:10.090
You warm enough?

01:16:16.174 --> 01:16:18.199
Anybody else hit?

01:16:18.276 --> 01:16:20.267
Everybody's fine, Father.

01:16:24.082 --> 01:16:26.448
- Are the Germans dead?
- Don't worry about that.

01:16:31.356 --> 01:16:33.790
You all right?

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:38.729
God have mercy
on those poor Germans.

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.591
God have mercy on us.

01:16:52.444 --> 01:16:54.742
- Don't... Don't tell Mother.
- I won't.

01:16:54.813 --> 01:17:01.548
- Don't tell Mother.
- I won't.

01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:04.680
Don't tell...
Don't tell Mother.

01:17:04.756 --> 01:17:06.951
Promise me.

01:17:07.025 --> 01:17:09.016
I won't.

01:17:58.543 --> 01:18:00.477
Is he dead?

01:18:03.448 --> 01:18:05.973
I think so, Vance.

01:18:13.558 --> 01:18:15.617
He ran out to warn me.

01:18:19.297 --> 01:18:21.231
Why?

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.064
I don't understand.

01:18:24.135 --> 01:18:27.263
I had a perfect position.

01:18:29.808 --> 01:18:31.935
I don't get it.

01:18:36.915 --> 01:18:39.884
He's stupid, Vance.

01:18:39.951 --> 01:18:42.818
He does stupid things.

01:19:02.207 --> 01:19:04.607
What a mess.

01:19:04.676 --> 01:19:07.839
Shit! It looked so easy.

01:19:07.912 --> 01:19:11.939
Looks like our friend here
got a million-dollar wound.

01:19:12.016 --> 01:19:13.950
The one guy who wants
to fight these bastards...

01:19:14.018 --> 01:19:16.384
and I get
the million-dollar wound?

01:19:16.454 --> 01:19:18.445
Isn't it the way?

01:19:20.091 --> 01:19:22.025
How's Mundy?

01:19:22.093 --> 01:19:26.655
He's dead. He died fast.
There was nothing I could do.

01:19:37.542 --> 01:19:39.635
What a fuckup.

01:19:42.313 --> 01:19:44.747
Father said don't tell Mother.

01:19:44.816 --> 01:19:46.750
That's what we'll do.

01:19:46.818 --> 01:19:51.312
We were pinned down,
and he saved us.

01:19:51.389 --> 01:19:53.380
That's the plan.

01:20:19.918 --> 01:20:23.354
Mother tells us
why he came out after us.

01:20:23.421 --> 01:20:27.255
Ware and Griffin are at the chateau,
looking for their prisoner.

01:20:27.325 --> 01:20:31.728
Well, we've got one,
if he stays alive.

01:20:32.897 --> 01:20:35.388
It's hard to look at Father.

01:20:35.467 --> 01:20:38.197
I keep waiting
for his eyes to open...

01:20:40.004 --> 01:20:44.839
waiting for him to tell me
it'll be all right if I just have faith.

01:20:54.486 --> 01:20:56.113
Sergeant Knott.

01:20:56.187 --> 01:20:58.212
- Yes, sir.
- Get some men out on post.

01:20:58.289 --> 01:21:01.747
The enemy camp may have heard
that skirmish and sent out a patrol.

01:21:01.826 --> 01:21:04.556
Well, sir, before the prisoner
went into shock...

01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:07.189
he told Shutzer that an enemy attack
was expected at any time.

01:21:07.265 --> 01:21:09.756
Well, now, holy shit, soldier!

01:21:09.834 --> 01:21:12.632
Just when the fuck
were you gonna tell us that?

01:21:12.704 --> 01:21:14.934
I thought this was an I & R platoon,
for Christ's sake!

01:21:15.006 --> 01:21:17.201
Lieutenant, get me Regiment
on the horn immediately.

01:21:17.275 --> 01:21:19.266
Whiz kids, my ass!

01:21:21.045 --> 01:21:23.912
Able 1 to Able 4, over.

01:21:23.982 --> 01:21:28.419
- Able 1 to Able 4, over.
- Corporal Leary here, over.

01:21:30.488 --> 01:21:32.718
Son, this is Major Griffin.
You take down this message...

01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:35.224
and get it to Regimental Command
on the double-quick, over.

01:21:35.293 --> 01:21:37.318
Wilco, sir. Over.

01:21:37.395 --> 01:21:40.228
"Have contacted enemy
and taken prisoner.

01:21:40.298 --> 01:21:44.029
Have suffered casualties.
One dead, one wounded.

01:21:44.102 --> 01:21:46.570
Have destroyed enemy outpost.

01:21:46.638 --> 01:21:50.369
Prisoner claims impending enemy attack
through this sector at any moment.

01:21:51.175 --> 01:21:55.111
Repeating. Prisoner claims impending
enemy attack at any moment.

01:21:55.179 --> 01:21:59.548
Am leaving immediately with prisoner and
wounded for base. Signed, Major Griffin."

01:21:59.617 --> 01:22:02.609
- Get that to the regimental commander.
- He ain't gonna make it.

01:22:02.687 --> 01:22:04.917
Over and out. Let's go.

01:22:07.125 --> 01:22:09.685
Sergeant Knott...

01:22:09.761 --> 01:22:13.162
have your men transfer the chains
from your jeep to my vehicle.

01:22:13.231 --> 01:22:15.825
We have a long way to go,
and the road's gonna be very rough.

01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:17.868
- Yes, sir.
- Son...

01:22:19.170 --> 01:22:22.901
I am shocked by
the conditions of these quarters.

01:22:22.974 --> 01:22:24.908
This is private property.

01:22:24.976 --> 01:22:27.137
The United States government
is responsible for it.

01:22:27.211 --> 01:22:29.907
It was in bad shape
when they moved in, Major.

01:22:32.650 --> 01:22:35.312
Are you finished, Lieutenant?

01:22:35.386 --> 01:22:39.447
Because there is ample evidence
to indicate a dereliction of duty...

01:22:39.524 --> 01:22:43.551
and conduct not becoming
an American combat troop.

01:22:43.628 --> 01:22:45.596
I'll be dead honest
with you here, son.

01:22:45.663 --> 01:22:49.326
I wonder if your fucking men even know
there's a war going on outside.

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:53.564
Were it not for extreme
extenuating circumstances...

01:22:53.638 --> 01:22:57.005
I would see that this soldier,
as noncom in charge...

01:22:57.075 --> 01:23:00.272
were brought before a military
review board and severely disciplined.

01:23:00.345 --> 01:23:03.576
And where the fuck
are your stripes?

01:23:03.648 --> 01:23:06.674
I'll be goddamned if you haven't
had enough time to sew them on.

01:23:06.751 --> 01:23:09.777
Yes, sir.

01:23:09.854 --> 01:23:13.255
- I'll get on it.
- No! You know what you'll do?

01:23:13.324 --> 01:23:15.792
You will march your ass outside...

01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:21.457
and transfer those chains from your jeep
to my vehicle on the double-time.

01:23:21.532 --> 01:23:23.591
Now!

01:23:34.912 --> 01:23:37.472
Lieutenant...

01:23:37.548 --> 01:23:41.678
do not ever contradict me
in front of the men again.

01:23:42.887 --> 01:23:44.946
All right, buddy,
you're almost home.

01:23:52.797 --> 01:23:55.357
What do you think, Mel?
Is he gonna be all right?

01:23:57.068 --> 01:23:59.662
Yeah, Shutzer's strong.
He'll be okay.

01:24:03.007 --> 01:24:05.942
They won't fall out
if you're careful, sir.

01:24:06.010 --> 01:24:08.843
It's a rough trip, but it'd help
if you'd loosen the tourniquets...

01:24:08.913 --> 01:24:11.541
every once in a while.

01:24:11.616 --> 01:24:14.847
- We'll do the best we can, Knott.
- Thank you, sir.

01:24:16.587 --> 01:24:19.055
Don't worry, Knott.
You done a good job.

01:24:20.124 --> 01:24:22.354
I don't think so, sir.

01:24:23.928 --> 01:24:29.298
Knott, Major Griffin wants you
to keep the squad here...

01:24:29.367 --> 01:24:30.891
until the Krauts attack.

01:24:32.904 --> 01:24:35.702
Stay here, sir?

01:24:35.773 --> 01:24:37.968
What do we do
when the attack comes?

01:24:38.042 --> 01:24:40.033
You contact us by radio.
We'll give you our position...

01:24:40.111 --> 01:24:43.080
then you get the hell out,
understood?

01:24:45.316 --> 01:24:48.979
- Understood, Knott?
- Yes, sir.

01:24:49.053 --> 01:24:51.044
Lieutenant Ware, goddamn it!

01:24:51.122 --> 01:24:53.955
Are you going to baby-sit
or drive this fucking jeep?

01:24:54.025 --> 01:24:57.017
- Be right there, sir, on the double.
- Get your ass in here!

01:24:57.095 --> 01:24:59.120
Good luck, Knott.

01:25:34.198 --> 01:25:37.292
Did you ever think about
how many dead people there must be?

01:25:41.205 --> 01:25:44.140
Looks like Father just joined
the great majority.

01:25:48.679 --> 01:25:51.375
Father told me he still wanted
to be a priest.

01:25:54.218 --> 01:25:56.743
He just didn't think
he was pure enough.

01:26:06.130 --> 01:26:08.963
You know, I've been thinking
maybe Father's the lucky one.

01:26:10.568 --> 01:26:13.901
I mean, is this whole world
run by shits like Griffin?

01:26:16.274 --> 01:26:18.868
If we get through this,
is that the way it's gonna be?

01:26:47.972 --> 01:26:51.066
What's the tree for?
You gonna burn it?

01:26:53.211 --> 01:26:55.679
Vance thought
a little Christmas cheer...

01:26:55.746 --> 01:26:58.681
would pick things up
around here a little bit.

01:27:00.351 --> 01:27:03.946
Thought we could roast some chestnuts
and stuff ourselves with turkey.

01:27:06.157 --> 01:27:08.250
You first, Will.

01:27:12.396 --> 01:27:14.796
You aren't the rankest, but...

01:27:14.866 --> 01:27:16.925
you do have rank on us.

01:27:18.236 --> 01:27:20.534
It's a...

01:27:20.605 --> 01:27:22.573
It's a Christmas present.

01:27:28.079 --> 01:27:32.243
We try to turn off the war.
We don't even keep a guard on.

01:27:32.316 --> 01:27:34.614
We figure when the attack starts,
we'll hear it.

01:29:43.981 --> 01:29:46.973
I asked Ware to put you in
for a citation.

01:29:47.051 --> 01:29:49.542
I hope that's okay.

01:29:51.455 --> 01:29:54.424
I think Father or Stan
should get it.

01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:59.186
No. You should.

01:29:59.263 --> 01:30:02.528
The Germans had us pinned down,
and you saved our asses.

01:30:10.241 --> 01:30:12.436
I only shot twice.

01:30:12.510 --> 01:30:17.470
After Father went down,
l... I didn't shoot anymore.

01:30:17.548 --> 01:30:20.346
My glasses were all fogged up.

01:30:20.418 --> 01:30:23.649
- I don't even know if I hit anybody.
- It doesn't matter.

01:30:23.721 --> 01:30:26.281
Just stick with the story.

01:30:26.357 --> 01:30:28.291
You shot them all.
That's what I told Ware.

01:30:28.359 --> 01:30:31.886
Maybe if you get decorated,
we can get you pulled out of here.

01:30:37.968 --> 01:30:42.462
Two-thirds of the squad is gone now.
I don't see how we're gonna make it.

01:30:44.809 --> 01:30:48.176
I'll make you a bet, Vance.

01:30:48.245 --> 01:30:50.873
I'll bet you that
in six months...

01:30:50.948 --> 01:30:54.315
you're back with Linda,
and she's pregnant...

01:30:54.385 --> 01:30:57.047
and this will all be something
you hardly remember.

01:30:58.956 --> 01:31:01.049
I doubt that.

01:31:03.694 --> 01:31:05.685
I'll bet you $100.

01:31:08.165 --> 01:31:10.326
Who has $100?

01:31:14.071 --> 01:31:16.835
You can pay me off
a bit at a time.

01:31:19.243 --> 01:31:21.871
We'll start
New Year's Day, 1946.

01:31:33.157 --> 01:31:35.489
- It's a bet.
- Yeah.

01:31:44.435 --> 01:31:44.935
Able 1 to Able 4, over.

01:31:44.935 --> 01:31:46.562
Able 1 to Able 4, over.

01:31:46.637 --> 01:31:49.162
Able 1 to Able 4, over.

01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:51.674
- Able 1 to anybody, over.
- Will, we got to go.

01:31:51.742 --> 01:31:53.676
Pull up the phones and the wires.

01:31:53.744 --> 01:31:55.837
Miller, if anybody can get
through on this thing you can.

01:31:55.913 --> 01:31:59.610
Just keep trying, all right?
Let's get Father out to the jeep.

01:31:59.683 --> 01:32:02.243
- Come on.
- Able 1 in.

01:32:03.754 --> 01:32:06.120
Able 4, come on.
Able 1 to Able 4.

01:32:18.068 --> 01:32:20.036
- Come on!
- Come on, Will! Let's go!

01:32:21.071 --> 01:32:22.038
Shit!

01:32:22.106 --> 01:32:24.836
Come on, Will, move it!
Move it!

01:32:34.351 --> 01:32:36.581
Fuckin' Griffin
took the chains off the jeep!

01:32:49.833 --> 01:32:52.529
Christ! There they are!

01:32:59.176 --> 01:33:01.701
- Oh, fuck!
- You all right?

01:33:02.947 --> 01:33:07.077
- I think so.
- Father got some.

01:33:11.488 --> 01:33:14.218
Another 100 yards
and we'll be out of range!

01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:20.925
- Straighten out.
- I can't! It's not doing anything!

01:33:20.998 --> 01:33:23.398
Straighten out!
Jesus Christ!

01:33:33.010 --> 01:33:36.502
- You guys all right?
- Hold it! We're about to slide over.

01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:38.639
Put some weight on the back,
Mother, on the back!

01:33:38.716 --> 01:33:41.082
Let's go. Let's go.

01:33:42.853 --> 01:33:47.449
- All right?
- Let's get Father and get out of here!

01:34:07.544 --> 01:34:12.072
Well, Sergeant Knott,
what the fuck do we do now?

01:34:12.149 --> 01:34:16.017
I can't believe
they'd just leave.

01:34:16.086 --> 01:34:19.180
Mel, what do you think?

01:34:19.256 --> 01:34:21.850
I don't know,
but we'd better keep moving.

01:34:39.977 --> 01:34:43.105
- I have no idea where we are.
- Just go.

01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:46.343
- We could be heading for Berlin.
- Just go!

01:35:40.804 --> 01:35:42.931
We're out of gas.

01:36:08.165 --> 01:36:11.157
We'll probably have
to surrender any time now.

01:36:11.235 --> 01:36:13.362
Miller insisted on
rigging up the.30 caliber.

01:36:13.437 --> 01:36:15.371
But without a real mount...

01:36:15.439 --> 01:36:18.806
it probably wouldn't sit still
long enough to hit anything.

01:36:18.876 --> 01:36:23.575
We can't stay here long,
and the jeep is dead.

01:36:23.647 --> 01:36:26.673
I wish Shutzer were here.
He might know what to do.

01:36:28.752 --> 01:36:30.720
I'm through playing soldier.

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:13.462
Did you see those markings?
That was honest-to-shit SS.

01:37:14.898 --> 01:37:17.731
What do we do now, Will?

01:37:17.801 --> 01:37:20.998
We stay away from them.

01:37:21.071 --> 01:37:24.666
What, you think they were
advancing or retreating?

01:37:27.845 --> 01:37:30.075
I wonder what they'll think?

01:37:30.147 --> 01:37:34.174
Maybe this will convince them
I am over the edge.

01:37:34.251 --> 01:37:36.412
We'll have a mutiny.

01:37:36.487 --> 01:37:38.455
I'll join it.

01:37:41.758 --> 01:37:44.352
- Thirty caliber?
- We'll bury it.

01:37:45.429 --> 01:37:47.829
- Radio?
- Bury it.

01:37:47.898 --> 01:37:52.665
- Rifles too?
- There's no other way.

01:37:54.171 --> 01:37:58.232
Even if we pull this off and get back,
what are we going to say?

01:37:58.308 --> 01:38:02.438
We'll say we were captured and they
took our weapons and then we escaped.

01:38:02.513 --> 01:38:04.811
But I'm thinking with
all this confusion going on...

01:38:04.882 --> 01:38:06.941
there's not gonna be
too many questions.

01:38:11.355 --> 01:38:14.188
We do it together or nothing.

01:38:14.258 --> 01:38:18.126
If anybody has any objections,
any at all, speak up now.

01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:21.923
Well, for what it's worth,
I say we do it.

01:38:23.767 --> 01:38:25.701
Yeah, me too.

01:38:25.769 --> 01:38:31.002
I mean, the idea's so wild, I'd be sorry
for the rest of my life if I didn't try.

01:38:31.074 --> 01:38:34.942
Of course, the rest of my life
could be today.

01:38:37.247 --> 01:38:39.875
Mother, don't let us pressure you.
You make up your own mind.

01:38:41.818 --> 01:38:45.754
I already have. I was only
waiting on the other guys...

01:38:45.822 --> 01:38:48.313
so I wouldn't
put pressure on them.

01:38:52.396 --> 01:38:55.524
This could be the deepest finesse
in squad history.

01:39:02.005 --> 01:39:04.940
I've never seen a better smile.

01:39:05.008 --> 01:39:08.808
It's the smile I need to make myself
do what we're gonna do.

01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:28.798
All right.

01:41:09.299 --> 01:41:10.425
Bleacher!

01:41:13.303 --> 01:41:14.793
Bleacher, goddamn it!

01:41:14.871 --> 01:41:17.135
We don't know the counter.
We're from another sector.

01:41:17.207 --> 01:41:19.675
Stay where you are.

01:41:25.115 --> 01:41:27.174
We're Americans.

01:41:37.027 --> 01:41:38.892
Is that blood?

01:41:40.630 --> 01:41:43.599
We give him our escape story.

01:41:43.667 --> 01:41:46.192
They tell us to take Father
to the grave registrar.

01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:20.160
They drive us back
to our own regiment.

01:42:20.237 --> 01:42:24.401
I'm sent straight to Ware,
and I tell him our story.

01:42:24.474 --> 01:42:26.874
I wander into
the kitchen tent...

01:42:26.943 --> 01:42:31.539
and curl up to sleep behind
the warm pots of hot water.

01:42:48.698 --> 01:42:50.723
Just wanted to let you know
it's all settled.

01:42:51.468 --> 01:42:55.029
Since you weren't in a POW compound,
you won't have to go through clearance.

01:42:55.105 --> 01:42:57.335
You can go right back
out in the field.

01:42:57.407 --> 01:43:01.309
I'm gonna fill out your platoon
with an antitank group they broke up.

01:43:01.378 --> 01:43:04.142
I put in for a Bronze Star
for Wilkins.

01:43:04.214 --> 01:43:07.411
Had him reassigned to the motor pool.
He's gonna be okay.

01:43:07.484 --> 01:43:08.917
Thank you, sir.

01:43:11.321 --> 01:43:14.154
Just wanted you to know I did my best
to radio you before we pulled out...

01:43:14.224 --> 01:43:16.158
but Griffin said
there wasn't any time.

01:43:18.328 --> 01:43:20.592
How's Shutzer doing?

01:43:20.664 --> 01:43:24.395
Real tough shit. He was dead
before we even got back.

01:43:24.467 --> 01:43:29.166
Kraut was dead too. Didn't even
have time to interrogate him.

01:43:29.239 --> 01:43:31.469
Before I go, you're gonna have to
fill out a statement of charges...

01:43:31.541 --> 01:43:34.032
for the jeep, radio and phones.

01:43:56.666 --> 01:43:58.964
We'll be moving out soon.

01:43:59.035 --> 01:44:02.198
Gonna push those fucking Kraut
bastards all the way back to Berlin.

01:44:07.677 --> 01:44:09.702
Merry Christmas, Knott.
