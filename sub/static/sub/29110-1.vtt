00:34.402 --> 00:39.438
Lucky, it's how my life
feels sometimes.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.057
Like it isn't mine

00:42.058 --> 00:44.675
but some fucked-up
alternate reality.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.779
I'm a lucky man.

00:46.781 --> 00:49.648
You think I don't realize that.

00:52.119 --> 00:55.287
First time I killed,
name was Eddie.

00:57.207 --> 00:59.124
Can't forget the look
in his eyes.

00:59.126 --> 01:01.193
Fear.

01:01.195 --> 01:04.196
Hadn't seen anything
like it before.

01:04.197 --> 01:06.432
Pure fear.

01:06.434 --> 01:09.334
He would have done anything
to live.

01:09.336 --> 01:11.403
But I had the gun

01:11.405 --> 01:14.206
and Cicero gave the order.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.375
Eddie's luck had run out.

01:25.252 --> 01:28.420
Guess I'm the lucky one.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.492
Jason, thank you.

01:33.494 --> 01:36.295
That was
a really strong performance.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.329
You got me.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.199
Right here.

01:42.236 --> 01:43.536
I've gotta say, Jay--

01:43.537 --> 01:44.837
Um, oh,
do you mind if I call you "Jay"?

01:44.839 --> 01:46.656
Sure.

01:46.657 --> 01:48.474
Jason, I was wondering is--
was that on the script

01:48.476 --> 01:49.808
that we sent you?

01:49.810 --> 01:53.512
Uh, yeah, look, it's right here.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.414
You see, you were reading the--
the character

01:55.416 --> 01:56.515
of Hank's dialogue.

01:56.517 --> 01:59.384
Yeah, yeah, I know that.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.286
Well, we kind of saw you more
for Tommy.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.321
Tommy?

02:02.323 --> 02:05.190
Hank's uh, stoner buddy.

02:05.192 --> 02:07.070
The fun guy.

02:07.071 --> 02:08.949
I know who Tommy is, but--

02:08.949 --> 02:10.828
Dude, it's the perfect role
for you, bro.

02:10.830 --> 02:14.800
I mean we loved you in <i> Clerks</i>.

02:14.802 --> 02:15.834
And <i> Clerks II</i>.

02:15.836 --> 02:16.869
Loved you.

02:16.871 --> 02:17.836
Loved you.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.355
Come on, dude,

02:19.356 --> 02:20.873
pooch
to the doochilly moochilly.

02:20.875 --> 02:23.542
Snooch to the-- ugh.

02:23.544 --> 02:24.810
Sam Lennox.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.311
Excuse me?

02:26.313 --> 02:27.813
The Golden Rocket.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.315
Yeah, I know Sam Lennox.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.434
I've got a hockey stick back
at my place

02:32.435 --> 02:34.552
signed
by the Golden Rocket himself.

02:34.555 --> 02:37.356
It's one of my most
prized possessions.

02:37.358 --> 02:42.628
That man could hit a slap shot
like no motherfucker alive.

02:42.630 --> 02:43.629
Rest of his game
wasn't up to much,

02:43.631 --> 02:46.231
but that slap shot...

02:46.233 --> 02:48.167
Pow!

02:48.169 --> 02:51.370
He built a career
for doing one thing incredibly.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.440
And the man is a fucking legend.

02:55.442 --> 02:57.709
You might wanna think
about that, mate.

02:57.711 --> 03:03.215
You know, I do every time I see
that stick on my wall.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.683
You let us know about the part.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.451
I'll let you know.

03:07.922 --> 03:09.922
All my details are on here.

03:09.924 --> 03:13.492
You get in touch anytime,
day or night.

03:13.494 --> 03:14.927
Will do, thanks.

03:14.929 --> 03:16.261
Jay.

03:16.263 --> 03:17.629
Pow!

03:23.337 --> 03:25.337
Mewes!

03:25.339 --> 03:26.572
Jay Mewes?

03:26.574 --> 03:27.973
What's up, man?

03:27.974 --> 03:29.373
Dude, can I get a picture
with you, huh?

03:29.376 --> 03:30.475
Sure, yeah, sure, of course.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.211
Oh man, you're a fucking legend.

03:32.213 --> 03:34.680
I can't believe you are
still alive, bro.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.699
Thanks, yeah, thanks for that.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.717
Dude, you guys should do another
<i>Jay and Silent Bob</i> movie.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.985
Um, yeah, it's up to Kevin.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.220
This is awesome, thanks, man.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.521
No problem, yeah.

03:48.796 --> 03:51.146
Hey, I'm Jason Mewes

03:51.147 --> 03:53.497
and I grew up in a small town
called "Highlands", New Jersey.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.267
You could say I was
that mischievous kid

03:55.269 --> 03:57.269
known around the town,

03:57.270 --> 03:59.270
but the truth is my childhood
was kind of fucked up.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.756
My mom used to drive around

04:00.757 --> 04:02.240
and have me steal
from mail boxes.

04:02.243 --> 04:05.277
She was single, three kids,
no money, no job.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.379
Well,
at least not a taxable one.

04:07.381 --> 04:10.515
Oh, and did I mention
she was addicted to drugs?

04:10.517 --> 04:12.451
Guess a shrink
would tell you

04:12.452 --> 04:14.386
that part kind of becomes
relevant later on.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.387
The drugs killed my mom,

04:16.389 --> 04:18.389
but that's not the story
I'm here to tell.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.526
Not today anyway.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.661
I wanna talk about a dude
named "Kevin Smith".

04:22.663 --> 04:25.764
This motherfucker
changed my life.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.666
He didn't really wanna hang out
with me when he first met me,

04:27.668 --> 04:29.668
but I would not leave it alone,
man,

04:29.670 --> 04:32.638
until finally
he started finding me funny.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.539
Before you know it
we're hanging out all the time,

04:34.541 --> 04:36.375
reading comic books and stuff.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.327
Inseparable!

04:38.328 --> 04:40.278
But I'm getting a little ahead
of myself here.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.915
I started working in New Jersey
as a roofer

04:42.916 --> 04:45.550
while Kevin had this crazy idea
he could be making movies.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.386
So he went off to film school.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.288
Next thing I know
Kevin quits film school

04:49.290 --> 04:50.589
and he's using
all his credit cards

04:50.591 --> 04:52.391
to make his own movie.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.559
Some madness about clerks.

04:54.561 --> 04:57.829
And thus Jay and Silent Bob
were born.

05:05.773 --> 05:08.607
I'm Jay and this is
my hetero life mate Silent Bob.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.979
I am the clit commander.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.584
♪ 15 bucks, little man ♪

05:19.586 --> 05:21.453
♪ Put that shit in my hand ♪

05:27.561 --> 05:30.729
Justice!

05:41.608 --> 05:43.442
Thank you for your contribution,
Claire.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.027
Thank you for the chip in.

05:45.028 --> 05:46.611
I know it doesn't seem like it
right now, but--

05:46.613 --> 05:48.196
It's gonna get better.

05:48.197 --> 05:49.780
You just have to be brave
and hang in there.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.049
Thank you.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.368
Yeah,
everyone thinks I'm a gangster,

06:09.369 --> 06:10.936
because of the roles I play,
Jay, you know?

06:10.938 --> 06:12.938
You're Vinnie Jones,
you're a fricking badass.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.607
I mean you're a soccer star
turned movie star.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.642
I mean who does that?

06:17.644 --> 06:18.777
No one, Jay.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.011
No one fucking does that.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.613
Hmm.

06:21.614 --> 06:23.214
- I ever show you that.
- What?

06:23.215 --> 06:24.815
You want me to work the nipples
while I cup the balls?

06:24.818 --> 06:26.752
No, I fucking don't.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.787
No, where did you get that?
I've never seen that.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.756
Back in the manor,

06:30.757 --> 06:32.724
older lads held me down,
carved Big Ben in me chest.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.727
They didn't do a bad job,
it's pretty good.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.829
You know, Jay, life's not a walk
in the park, mate.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.598
Could have been very different
for you and me.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.032
That's very true.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.834
You know,
whenever I get negative

06:42.835 --> 06:44.635
I always have a look
in the mirror,

06:44.638 --> 06:46.171
I look at the scar,
the clock,

06:46.172 --> 06:47.705
- you know what I mean?
- Hmm.

06:47.708 --> 06:50.542
Brings it all,
keeps me grounded.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.744
Fuck my balls, it's you!

06:52.746 --> 06:54.813
Is the fat one nearby?

06:54.815 --> 06:57.182
He's probably at home.

06:57.183 --> 06:59.550
Hey, mate,
have you got a fat boy for me?

06:59.553 --> 07:01.270
A fat boy?

07:01.271 --> 07:02.988
Not what you're thinking, ugh!

07:02.990 --> 07:04.823
Oh, you beauty!

07:04.825 --> 07:07.058
Believe me, sir,
you could attack Russia

07:07.060 --> 07:08.810
with this mother bitch.

07:08.811 --> 07:10.561
- I might try it, mate,
- Please, be careful,

07:10.564 --> 07:12.097
the health and safety record
is not--

07:12.099 --> 07:14.099
Cool, it's cool.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.700
It's for my mate,
it's his birthday next week,

07:15.702 --> 07:16.902
he loves this shit.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.570
Motherfucker!

07:18.572 --> 07:20.305
What's the matter?

07:20.306 --> 07:22.039
This motherfucker on eBay,
man.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.875
You're buying stuff
behind the Missus' back again?

07:23.877 --> 07:26.144
This is number 69,
Hardwyre Hactivist.

07:32.719 --> 07:36.988
I want this so bad, Vinnie,
it makes my balls burn.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.690
You can get cream for that,
you know, son?

07:38.692 --> 07:40.592
How much you paying
for this fucking thing?

07:40.594 --> 07:41.693
Way too much, man.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.745
If I meet this motherfucker,

07:43.746 --> 07:45.796
I'm gonna make him eat his dog
and phone.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.967
It's dog and bone, you prat.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.735
- What?
- Dog and bone

07:50.737 --> 07:52.838
is Cockney rhyming slang
for phone.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.140
Dog and bone, phone,
you fucking muppet.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.775
Wait,
what does muppet rhyme with?

07:56.777 --> 07:58.043
Nothing!

07:58.045 --> 08:00.011
You are the muppet!

08:04.685 --> 08:06.251
I appreciate this so much, Vin.

08:06.252 --> 08:07.818
The podcast is
an hour's drive away

08:07.821 --> 08:09.955
and I can't be late for Kevin.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.891
I will obey every traffic law,
I will go the speed limit.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.426
You get pulled over,

08:14.427 --> 08:15.960
you're gonna be
in jail all night,

08:15.961 --> 08:17.494
then I'm gonna have to come
and bail you out.

08:17.495 --> 08:19.028
Well, my licence is suspended,
I can't rent a car.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.499
It's for one night.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.035
I won't tell if you don't tell.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.039
You break it, you buy it.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.777
Oh my God, I look so old.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.813
God damn it, I hate it, man.

08:34.815 --> 08:37.048
I look like my father
fucked my grandmother

08:37.049 --> 08:38.933
and had me as a baby.

08:38.934 --> 08:40.818
That's what I'm gonna talk about
tonight on the show.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.254
You might wanna lighten up
a little bit,

08:42.256 --> 08:43.889
you're so fucking bummed.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.156
What's the matter,
little boy blue?

08:45.158 --> 08:47.993
It's nothing, it's...

08:47.995 --> 08:50.795
Oh, today was the audition,
wasn't it?

08:50.797 --> 08:52.355
Didn't work out.

08:52.356 --> 08:53.914
They just wanted you to be Jay,
right?

08:53.915 --> 08:55.473
Their casting director
is an asshole.

08:55.474 --> 08:57.032
I just don't understand
why they can't consider me

08:57.037 --> 08:58.904
for a serious role.

08:58.906 --> 09:01.940
They don't necessarily think
of you as an acteur,

09:01.942 --> 09:04.343
like the moment you walk
into the room

09:04.344 --> 09:06.745
and that's honestly,
probably my fault,

09:06.747 --> 09:08.313
'cause I've made you
this character.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.948
No, I don't think
it's your fault.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.572
You lettin' me off the hook.

09:11.573 --> 09:13.195
Good, 'cause I always thought
it was your fault,

09:13.196 --> 09:14.818
because I based the character
on who you were

09:14.821 --> 09:16.421
when you were a kid.

09:16.422 --> 09:18.022
So technically, you dug
your own fucking grave.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.591
Fuck you, Moves,

09:19.592 --> 09:21.158
I just wanna be taken serious
for once.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.094
Why don't you ask O'Halloran,
he's making a movie.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.829
Brian O'Halloran is directing?

09:24.831 --> 09:26.565
He submitted a script
to the studio,

09:26.567 --> 09:28.199
they went apeshit,
they fucking bought it,

09:28.201 --> 09:29.968
and they're letting him direct.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.003
Um,<i> The Odyssey</i>.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.572
No way,<i> The Odyssey</i>.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.140
I read that
while we were doing Dogma

09:35.142 --> 09:37.342
and we talked about it
a million times.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.978
Dude, I'm like perfect
for the lead.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.530
Oh, okay.

09:41.531 --> 09:43.081
Well, look,
I think the main character

09:43.083 --> 09:44.700
is very much like you.

09:44.701 --> 09:46.318
Whether or not you should
play the lead,

09:46.320 --> 09:47.953
that's a whole
different discussion.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.388
Can you talk to him for me?

09:49.389 --> 09:50.822
It will sound better coming
from you.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.857
I-- I don't wanna get involved.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.559
I don't want
to call Brian O'Halloran.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.260
You know what happens
when you call Brian O'Halloran.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.196
"Hey, man, pussy, man."

09:58.197 --> 10:00.130
He talks about pussy
for like two hours and shit.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.968
I'm 46,
I'm done talking about that.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.295
Here's what you need to do.

10:04.296 --> 10:05.621
You gotta drop science
on the fools.

10:05.622 --> 10:06.947
You can't just walk into a room

10:06.948 --> 10:08.273
and be like
"Snooch to the nooch."

10:08.275 --> 10:09.608
They've seen that shit, man.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.376
Jay and silly Bill are over.

10:11.377 --> 10:13.143
What they want out of an actor
walk in to the room,

10:13.146 --> 10:14.946
it's commanding presence, man.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.615
Walk in there
like you're the authority

10:16.617 --> 10:18.283
and drop some method
on their asses.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.729
Method?

10:19.730 --> 10:21.174
Alright,
fucking Daniel Day-Lewis

10:21.175 --> 10:22.619
in <i> My Left Foot</i>,
remember that shit?

10:22.623 --> 10:23.878
No.

10:23.879 --> 10:25.134
Alright,<i> Suicide Squad</i>.

10:25.135 --> 10:26.390
- Remember Jared Leto?
- Yes.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.776
While they're making that movie,

10:27.777 --> 10:29.160
there were all these stories
in the press

10:29.162 --> 10:31.229
about he was going method on it.

10:31.231 --> 10:34.165
He was trying to get
into the heart and soul

10:34.167 --> 10:35.166
of that character.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.935
That's what method is.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.703
Method is when an actor,
such as yourself,

10:38.705 --> 10:40.639
just immerses themselves,

10:40.641 --> 10:42.173
puts their head
straight up the ass

10:42.175 --> 10:44.075
of whatever character it is
they are playing.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.277
Leto stuck his head
right up the Joker's ass.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.313
Even when he wasn't on camera,

10:48.315 --> 10:50.749
he was still
in the Joker mindset.

10:50.751 --> 10:54.953
And as we saw from that movie,
it doesn't always work.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.989
But like-- like Daniel Day-Lewis
made it work

10:56.990 --> 10:59.024
in <i> My Left Foot</i>,
motherfucker is in a wheelchair

10:59.025 --> 11:01.059
for like 26 years prepping
for that role

11:01.061 --> 11:02.627
and shit like that.

11:02.628 --> 11:04.194
I don't understand a word
you're fucking saying.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.131
Matt Damon once told me
about it.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.699
I didn't get it.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.266
He explained it to me
and he explained it thusly,

11:09.269 --> 11:10.435
he said, "Read a book."

11:10.437 --> 11:12.254
He goes, "Read this book."

11:12.255 --> 11:14.072
And I'm gonna text you the name
of this fucking book.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.675
"Read this book," he tells me,
"And I swear to you

11:16.677 --> 11:18.777
not only will you understand
method acting,

11:18.779 --> 11:22.013
but you yourself
will become a better director."

11:22.015 --> 11:23.098
And I never fucking read it.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.182
You know who did?
Ben.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.561
And he won an Oscar.

11:25.562 --> 11:26.939
Is it there?
Did it pop up?

11:26.940 --> 11:28.317
Yeah, it popped up.

11:28.321 --> 11:29.754
You're the sweetest
fucking person

11:29.756 --> 11:31.289
I know in this world, honestly.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.692
Look, you've got
a $1,000,000 heart.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.094
Nickel-head, but
a $1,000,000 heart, man.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.363
Very few people like you
in the world, man.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.365
Sweethearts get killed
in this business.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.267
You've got to be a badass, dude.

11:42.269 --> 11:45.270
You gotta go into a room,
be the motherfucking boss.

11:45.272 --> 11:46.371
The boss?

11:46.373 --> 11:48.039
The motherfucking boss!

11:48.809 --> 11:50.259
One up.

11:50.260 --> 11:51.710
There is the song, brother.
The song.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.244
We gotta do our exercises, man.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.479
Okay, ready for this?

11:54.480 --> 11:55.713
Lion face.

11:55.716 --> 11:56.715
Roar!

11:56.717 --> 11:58.083
Lemon face.

11:58.084 --> 11:59.450
Lion face.

11:59.453 --> 12:01.286
Dick-sucking face.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.439
- Now, we good.
- Yeah!

12:04.440 --> 12:05.756
- Let's go do this.
- Yeah.

12:05.757 --> 12:07.073
Go get 'em, man, go get 'em.

12:07.074 --> 12:08.390
Yeah, boy, yeah!

12:08.395 --> 12:09.670
Hold on, hold on, give it.

12:09.671 --> 12:10.946
- Give me a hug.
- Oh.

12:10.947 --> 12:12.222
I love you, bro.

12:12.223 --> 12:13.498
Be funny, make me laugh.
Make me laugh!

12:13.500 --> 12:15.266
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

12:47.467 --> 12:49.434
<i>George,
you asshole</i>, <i>you call yourself security.</i>

12:49.436 --> 12:51.302
<i>I told you I don't wanna see
that Latina girl</i>

12:51.304 --> 12:52.771
<i>or any girl for that matter!</i>

12:52.773 --> 12:54.990
It-- it-- it-- it's me.

12:54.991 --> 12:57.208
I-- I-- I talked to you online
about the method acting book.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.844
<i>Is there anyone else around?</i>

12:59.846 --> 13:01.846
No.
No, it's just me.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.028
Hello?

13:25.505 --> 13:30.942
Snooch to the
motherfucking nooch.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.011
I can't believe it's really you.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.814
Wait a second,
do we know each other?

Wait, what-- what do you mean?
I mean...

14:02.042 --> 14:04.075
What are you doing in my house?

14:04.076 --> 14:06.109
Oh, I came here
to purchase the book, so...

14:06.112 --> 14:07.846
You wanna die, Snoogans Boy!

14:07.848 --> 14:09.013
What tha-- uh, sir, I'm just--

14:09.015 --> 14:10.882
My name is Fernando Villareal.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.951
I-- uh, uh, uh...

14:17.090 --> 14:19.023
Oh, yeah.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.325
I'm just messing with you.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.394
It's a pleasure
to meet you, man.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.363
I've seen all your movies.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.131
Thanks.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.900
You thought I'd shoot you
for real, huh?

14:28.902 --> 14:30.134
Well, I uh, I've--

14:30.136 --> 14:31.135
Thought you were messing
with me,

14:31.137 --> 14:34.005
Mr. Thingything.

14:34.007 --> 14:38.943
I'll see if I shoot you
with uh, chief of police's gun.

14:38.945 --> 14:40.578
What the fuck?

14:48.588 --> 14:53.157
Listen to me very carefully,
Mewes.

14:53.159 --> 14:56.394
I cannot let this book go just
to anyone.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.264
It is the only one in existence.

15:02.168 --> 15:04.903
You have to read it slowly.

15:04.905 --> 15:07.438
You can't mainline it.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.174
Cut it up with other books.

15:10.176 --> 15:15.580
Get some Chaucer, Dickens in you
at the same time.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.614
Uh, Dickens uh--

15:18.518 --> 15:22.587
Once you read the book,
you can't unread it.

15:37.637 --> 15:40.071
It is not a guide
to successful acting,

15:40.073 --> 15:43.207
it is a guide to life.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.479
Carrie, baby, you home?

15:55.121 --> 15:56.955
Come on, motherfucker.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.630
Oh, hey, baby.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.065
Where you been?

16:07.066 --> 16:08.499
Just out with some girlfriends.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.601
Oh!

16:10.603 --> 16:12.070
What's that?

16:12.072 --> 16:13.504
It's Vinnie's.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.206
You brought Vinnie's bomb
into the house?

16:15.208 --> 16:18.343
No, no, it's not a bomb,
it's a fat boy.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.978
Alright, I'll get the bomb--

16:19.980 --> 16:21.279
Out of the house.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.714
I tried to call you earlier.

16:22.716 --> 16:24.716
Did you fix the roof today?

16:26.720 --> 16:29.053
You do know what this means,
don't you?

16:29.055 --> 16:31.522
Jay's been a bad Jay.

16:31.524 --> 16:36.694
And what happens when Jay's been
a very bad Jay?

16:39.199 --> 16:41.366
I am the clit commander.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.067
Oh!

16:43.069 --> 16:45.770
Command my clit, commander.

16:45.772 --> 16:48.022
Snoochie boochie!

16:48.023 --> 16:50.273
Oh, command my clit, commander.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.340
Feel the anger.

17:23.343 --> 17:26.277
Feel it for real.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.377
Fuck!

17:27.380 --> 17:28.713
Fuck you.

17:28.715 --> 17:29.747
Fuck you.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.049
What?

17:31.051 --> 17:32.250
What mother...

17:43.696 --> 17:45.363
Snoochie boochies.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.315
Snoochie boochies.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.266
Snoochie boochies.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.335
- Snoochie boochies.
- So much shit.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.271
- Snoochie boochies.
- Fuck.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.409
I'm sorry.

18:14.410 --> 18:16.094
There's no current news
about this actor.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.763
Perhaps you spelled it
incorrectly.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.364
What the hell?

18:31.244 --> 18:32.577
Fuck you.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.779
Time for drastic action.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.633
I'll show 'em crazy.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.503
Hollywood wants
something drastic.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.371
Scare 'em for real.

That's right.

19:01.407 --> 19:02.406
Give me that method.

19:02.408 --> 19:03.407
Method!

19:36.309 --> 19:37.909
What the fuck?

19:37.911 --> 19:39.443
- Yes, Jason?
- Hey, motherfucker--

19:39.445 --> 19:40.761
- Whoa!
- Fuck.

19:40.762 --> 19:42.078
You don't think I'm good enough
for your piece-of-shit movie,

19:42.079 --> 19:43.395
- huh?
- I didn't fucking say-- shit.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.551
Whoa, whoa whoa, whoa.

19:46.553 --> 19:47.969
Jay--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:47.970 --> 19:49.386
You think you know me, bitch?

19:49.389 --> 19:50.454
You don't know me.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.325
Jay, Jay, whoa!

19:57.197 --> 19:58.429
- Whoa!
- Pow, bitch!

19:58.431 --> 19:59.597
Whoa, oh!

20:01.267 --> 20:02.700
It was just a misunderstanding!

20:04.737 --> 20:06.671
Oh, you motherfucker!

20:06.673 --> 20:08.372
Where the fuck are you?

20:08.374 --> 20:09.440
Where the fuck?

20:44.377 --> 20:45.843
Shit, the keys.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.391
Fuck, where is he?

21:15.775 --> 21:17.642
Shit, Jason, don't be stupid.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.697
Oh, motherfucker!

21:44.604 --> 21:46.437
You, motherfucker!

21:46.439 --> 21:47.905
Pow!

21:50.943 --> 21:52.710
Oh shit!
Be calm.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.712
Get this out of the way
and breathe.

21:54.714 --> 21:56.347
Hazards.

21:56.349 --> 21:58.616
Reverse.

21:58.618 --> 22:00.451
I got this.

22:01.721 --> 22:03.454
Oh.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.590
Okay, okay.

22:06.592 --> 22:08.592
Okay.

22:08.594 --> 22:10.394
Oof, okay.

22:10.396 --> 22:11.696
Phew!

22:12.865 --> 22:14.682
You cool, bro?

22:14.683 --> 22:16.500
I think I might've nicked you
with the car there.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.744
Anthony?

22:28.514 --> 22:29.647
Bro?

22:33.653 --> 22:35.753
Okay.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.688
Okay, Jason Mewes,
you got this, man.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.590
Okay, method this.

22:39.592 --> 22:40.991
You got this.

22:40.993 --> 22:44.028
Come on.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.596
Oops, sorry about that.

22:45.598 --> 22:48.566
Alright.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.506
Oh shit!

22:57.510 --> 22:58.743
Not cool, bro.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.778
He didn't see me, man.

23:02.782 --> 23:03.881
I do yoga.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.051
Fuck, he might've saw me.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.619
What the fuck!

23:08.621 --> 23:10.238
Fuck!

23:10.239 --> 23:11.856
He might've fucking saw me,
shit.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.524
Nah, he didn't see me.

23:13.526 --> 23:14.825
He couldn't have seen me.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.060
I was like this.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.795
Like this.

23:17.797 --> 23:19.831
He might have saw me.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.866
Nah, he didn't see me,
I'm too fucking good.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.701
Shit.

23:30.676 --> 23:32.643
Shit.

23:53.566 --> 23:55.766
Jay, what the fucking hell
are you doing?

23:55.768 --> 23:57.568
Uh--
I was just returning your car.

23:57.570 --> 23:59.081
I mean I--

23:59.082 --> 24:00.593
Why couldn't you wait
till the morning?

24:00.594 --> 24:02.105
I just thought you needed
the car back early, right?

24:02.108 --> 24:03.841
- So...
- No, I don't need it early.

24:03.843 --> 24:05.043
I'm sorry, bro, I just--

24:05.044 --> 24:06.244
I just wanted
to make sure you had it--

24:06.245 --> 24:07.445
Do you want a lift?

24:07.446 --> 24:08.646
No, no, I'm gonna walk, the la--

24:08.648 --> 24:10.131
Stay here if you want.

24:10.132 --> 24:11.615
No, it's like my old lady
wants me home,

24:11.617 --> 24:13.017
like do the like cuddling
and stuff.

24:13.019 --> 24:14.852
Plus,
she has me on this diet thing,

24:14.854 --> 24:16.120
she thinks I'm getting fat,
so I'll walk.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.087
- Oh!
- It's fine.

24:17.089 --> 24:19.757
Thank you.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.725
Fucking muppet.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.050

Jason.

25:46.546 --> 25:48.279
- Jason, Jason!
- Huh?

25:48.281 --> 25:50.014
Something's happened to Vinnie.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.849
- Vinnie?
- Listen.

25:51.851 --> 25:53.884
Early hours of the morning,
Mr. Jones,

25:53.886 --> 25:55.553
the well-known British sports
and movie star

25:55.555 --> 25:57.087
was taken into custody.

25:57.089 --> 25:59.957
Our sources report
that the charge is homicide.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.859
Jones has a reputation
on the soccer field

26:01.861 --> 26:06.297
for grabbing genitalia
and for his big hard tackles.

26:06.299 --> 26:07.498
That'll be the press.

26:07.499 --> 26:08.698
They know you guys were friends.

26:10.836 --> 26:13.037
Mr. Jason Mewes,
I should have known.

26:13.039 --> 26:14.514
Excuse me?

26:14.515 --> 26:15.990
I need to ask you
a few questions

26:15.991 --> 26:17.466
regarding a homicide
that happened

26:17.467 --> 26:18.942
in the Hollywood Hills
last night.

26:18.945 --> 26:20.995
A homicide,
I can't help you with that,

26:20.996 --> 26:23.046
I've been home here
the whole night.

26:23.049 --> 26:24.848
- You need to stop resisting.
- But, wait a second.

26:24.850 --> 26:26.442
I'm not resisting,
I'm just saying

26:26.443 --> 26:28.035
that I don't know anything
about a homicide--

26:28.036 --> 26:29.628
Suspect is resisting!

26:29.629 --> 26:31.221
You have the right
to remain silent.

26:48.274 --> 26:51.275
Does the name Anthony Costalino
ring a bell?

26:52.178 --> 26:53.644
No.

26:53.645 --> 26:55.111
He was murdered outside
of his home last night

26:55.114 --> 26:56.180
in an apparent hit-and-run.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.117
Uh, I'm s-- sorry to hear that.

27:00.118 --> 27:02.085
We have reason to believe
that there was an altercation

27:02.088 --> 27:04.254
that took place inside
of his home prior to the murder.

27:06.091 --> 27:07.925
Um, with all due respect,
officer--

27:07.927 --> 27:09.460
Detective.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.994
What does that have to do
with me?

27:10.995 --> 27:12.528
Vinnie Jones' car was confirmed

27:12.529 --> 27:14.062
- as the hit-and-run vehicle.
- What?

27:14.066 --> 27:15.933
The neighbor was able
to write down the plates

27:15.935 --> 27:18.902
right before the car sped off.

27:18.904 --> 27:21.271
We found fragments of brain
and skull--

27:21.273 --> 27:24.908
- Buddy?
- All up in the grill.

27:24.910 --> 27:29.146
I guess the uh, murderer forgot
to clean that up, didn't he?

27:29.148 --> 27:31.048
Well, what does Vinnie have
to say about it?

27:31.050 --> 27:32.867
It's like I'm going off
my fucking head.

27:32.868 --> 27:34.685
Vinnie is adamantly denying
all charges.

27:34.687 --> 27:36.086
And the witness?

27:36.088 --> 27:38.055
We were lucky the witness
said anything--

27:38.057 --> 27:39.757
Oh!
Oh my God!

27:41.460 --> 27:43.160
He's a bit traumatized
by the situation,

27:43.162 --> 27:45.129
but the doctor said
that he'll be back in a week

27:45.131 --> 27:48.065
and we'll be having
a nice little chit chat with him

27:48.067 --> 27:50.134
about exactly what happened
that night.

27:50.136 --> 27:51.702
He-- he probably would have
blurted something out

27:51.703 --> 27:53.269
when he gave you the plates,
right?

27:53.272 --> 27:55.205
So he probably
doesn't know anything.

27:57.143 --> 27:59.110
Do you recognize this,
Mr. Mewes?

27:59.111 --> 28:01.078
This is my wallet,
I've been looking for that.

28:01.079 --> 28:03.046
We found it in the back
of Mr. Jones' car.

28:03.049 --> 28:05.082
You know what, actually,
I was in the supermarket.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.251
He-- he drove me
to the supermarket yesterday

28:07.253 --> 28:09.353
and I think I must have
dropped it in there.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.221
- I mean...
- And you were driving the car?

28:11.223 --> 28:12.731
No, no, no, Vinnie dropped me.

28:12.732 --> 28:14.240
Because you are not allowed
to drive,

28:14.241 --> 28:15.749
are you, Mr. Mewes?

28:15.750 --> 28:17.258
I can drive starting today.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.163
You lost your license
for speeding.

28:19.165 --> 28:20.364
Finding a wallet
in the back seat

28:20.366 --> 28:22.132
of a friend's car
is enough reason

28:22.134 --> 28:24.034
to charge someone for murder?

28:24.036 --> 28:25.302
Should we arrest you for murder?

28:25.304 --> 28:26.787
Isn't that why I'm here?

28:26.788 --> 28:28.271
You are here, because you were
resisting arrest

28:28.272 --> 28:29.755
and you showed
extreme aggression

28:29.756 --> 28:31.239
towards detective Peterson
and myself.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.409
You're not pressing charges.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.044
No.

28:34.046 --> 28:37.448
But, Mr. Mewes,
don't go far now.

28:37.450 --> 28:39.483
Hopefully not.

28:43.089 --> 28:45.823
Is uh, Vinnie allowed
to have visitors?

28:45.825 --> 28:47.791
You've gotta to go
and get me out of here.

28:47.793 --> 28:48.826
You gotta spring me.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.973
And I'll be in the cell?

28:50.974 --> 28:53.119
I'm-- I'm going insane here.

28:53.120 --> 28:55.265
This is getting deeper
and deeper in the shit.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.067
Yeah, mate.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.868
Give us five minutes,
will you leave?

28:58.871 --> 29:00.129
Pleased to see you, mate.

29:00.130 --> 29:01.388
They brought me down, too.

29:01.389 --> 29:02.647
They found my wallet
in your car.

29:02.648 --> 29:03.906
I know they did,
but I didn't give 'em your name.

29:03.909 --> 29:05.843
Plenty of things I am.

29:05.844 --> 29:07.778
One thing I ain't is
a fucking grass.

29:07.780 --> 29:09.446
But I'm sorry
to have to ask this.

29:09.448 --> 29:13.751
No,
I know what you're gonna say.

29:13.753 --> 29:15.519
You have anything
to do with this at all?

29:15.521 --> 29:17.138
Man, I swear I do not.

29:17.139 --> 29:18.756
I don't know what--
what's going on here.

29:18.758 --> 29:20.891
I'm embarrassed
to fucking say it.

29:20.893 --> 29:23.794
You ever met this geezer,
Anthony Costalino?

29:23.796 --> 29:25.438
Um, never.

29:25.439 --> 29:27.081
You never saw anyone around

29:27.082 --> 29:28.724
when you dropped the car off,
did you?

29:28.725 --> 29:30.367
Any little detail that could
help me out a little bit

29:30.369 --> 29:32.536
and-- Jay.

29:32.538 --> 29:34.238
Jay?
Anything.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.339
No, I didn't see anything,
you know?

29:35.341 --> 29:36.774
Nothing at all.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.208
It's gotta be something
I'd done years ago

29:38.210 --> 29:39.476
and they've got the beef
about it.

29:39.478 --> 29:41.211
Seriously?

29:41.213 --> 29:44.098
Trying to stitch me right up.

29:44.099 --> 29:46.984
They found the idiot's blood
on the door fucking mat.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.886
I've put me hands up
loads of times.

29:48.887 --> 29:50.787
Fucking do the crime,
you do the time, and that's it.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.422
I've got nothing
to do with this, Jay,

29:52.424 --> 29:54.024
you know that.

29:56.262 --> 29:57.327
You know-- you know what?

29:57.329 --> 29:59.329
I'm gonna fix this, bro.

29:59.331 --> 30:00.330
I'm gonna get you out.

30:00.331 --> 30:01.330
What do you mean you'll fix it?

30:01.331 --> 30:02.330
How can you fix it?

30:02.334 --> 30:03.467
Just sit tight.

30:03.469 --> 30:04.835
What do you mean sit tight?

30:04.837 --> 30:05.836
Jay!

30:05.838 --> 30:06.937
Jay!

30:16.698 --> 30:18.348
Can I speak
to Detective Arnold, please?

30:18.350 --> 30:21.218
And what is it concerning?

30:21.220 --> 30:23.420
It's
about the Vinnie Jones murder.

30:27.393 --> 30:28.926
One moment please.

30:34.433 --> 30:35.744
Hi, Geena, I've--

30:35.745 --> 30:37.056
I know
you got arrested for murder

30:37.057 --> 30:38.368
or something like that.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.170
Are you out yet?

30:40.171 --> 30:41.971
Because if you're not,
whatever you are doing

30:41.974 --> 30:45.409
is not as important
as this right now.

30:45.411 --> 30:46.977
And even if you are
still under arrest,

30:46.979 --> 30:49.229
you need to escape.

30:49.230 --> 30:51.480
Eva Campbell from
Haw fucking thorn productions,

30:51.483 --> 30:53.450
- she wants you to come in.
- Hawthorn?

30:53.452 --> 30:55.485
They just turned me down
for a role last month.

30:55.487 --> 30:58.322
Oliver Radburn
just called in sick,

30:58.324 --> 30:59.523
first day of the shoot.

30:59.525 --> 31:00.557
Is he alright?

31:00.559 --> 31:01.992
Oh, who the hell knows?

31:01.993 --> 31:03.426
The producer saw you
getting arrested

31:03.429 --> 31:05.495
on TV this morning.

31:05.497 --> 31:07.531
Thinks you fit
in the role perfectly,

31:07.533 --> 31:11.034
but you gotta make it in there
right now.

31:11.036 --> 31:14.438
Eva says they are holding
the entire production.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.541
They are sitting around wasting
thousands of dollars an hour.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.243
This is the film business.

31:19.244 --> 31:20.944
You don't waste
that kind of money--

31:20.945 --> 31:22.645
Ain't the fucking '90s.

31:22.648 --> 31:24.615
They're desperate!

31:24.617 --> 31:26.350
Is there many lines?

31:26.352 --> 31:28.135
Eva is going crazy.

31:28.136 --> 31:29.919
She says this part is
a game-changer,

31:35.194 --> 31:35.893
a career-changer.

31:35.894 --> 31:36.593
Could steal the entire movie.

31:36.594 --> 31:37.293
<i>You're looking
at a guaranteed theatrical.</i>

31:37.294 --> 31:37.993
This is gonna slam you
right where you wanna be.

31:37.997 --> 31:41.899
Opportunities don't drop
in your lap like this.

31:41.901 --> 31:44.034
It's a perfect storm,
you son of a bitch,

31:44.036 --> 31:46.036
so don't fuck this up.

31:46.038 --> 31:47.471
Get your ass over there

31:47.472 --> 31:48.905
and try not to kill anybody
on the way.

31:48.908 --> 31:50.333
Jesus, Geena!

31:50.334 --> 31:51.759
What?
Too soon?

31:51.760 --> 31:53.185
Oh God, you can't take a joke.

31:53.186 --> 31:54.611
Alright, well,
just get your ass down there,

31:54.613 --> 31:56.146
Alright, Jason?

31:56.148 --> 31:57.948
Jason?

31:57.950 --> 31:59.767
Oh, come on, Jason.

31:59.768 --> 32:01.585
- You wanna see me?
<i>- Are you there</i> ?

32:01.587 --> 32:02.986
Jason!

32:02.988 --> 32:04.605
Yeah, I, uh--

32:04.606 --> 32:06.223
Jay!

32:06.225 --> 32:08.191
- I, uh--
- Drop in your lap.

32:08.193 --> 32:09.192
Career-changer.

32:09.194 --> 32:10.193
Eva Campbell.

32:10.195 --> 32:11.929
Opportunities.

32:11.931 --> 32:13.130
Steal the entire movie.

32:13.132 --> 32:15.065
Don't fuck this up.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.468
Yeah, I wanted to make sure
there is no bad blood

32:18.470 --> 32:20.570
between the two of us
and I was just gonna say

32:20.572 --> 32:22.606
if I can be
of any further assistance,

32:22.608 --> 32:24.808
just please give me a call.

32:24.809 --> 32:27.009
And I hope
you find the real killer.

32:27.012 --> 32:28.178
Thanks.

32:29.982 --> 32:30.948
Mr. Mewes!

32:30.950 --> 32:33.116
Mr. Jay!

32:59.144 --> 33:01.178
Hello, David.

33:01.180 --> 33:05.048
Have you ever tried acupuncture?

33:05.050 --> 33:07.751
You see what's really amazing is
if you stab right here--

33:08.942 --> 33:10.130
You feel the pain simultaneously
in your feet.

33:10.131 --> 33:11.319
Cut! Cut!

33:11.323 --> 33:12.756
For God's sake, cut.

33:12.758 --> 33:13.991
Put the light on.

33:13.993 --> 33:16.059
Okay, lights up, please.

33:18.998 --> 33:20.564
Jason,

33:20.565 --> 33:22.131
darling, that was
absolutely spellbinding.

33:22.134 --> 33:24.234
Thank you.

33:24.235 --> 33:26.335
Uh, oh,
are you doing your method there?

33:26.338 --> 33:27.704
Sorry.

33:27.705 --> 33:29.071
Uh, I'll give you a moment.

33:29.074 --> 33:31.675
Harold, darling,
I believed your pain,

33:31.677 --> 33:33.744
but you forgot your cue
at the end, darling.

33:33.746 --> 33:35.079
Um, passing out, remember?

33:35.080 --> 33:36.413
Oh, you believed
my fucking pain,

33:36.414 --> 33:37.747
'cause I'm in fucking agony.

33:37.748 --> 33:39.081
I told you that blade
is too sharp.

33:39.084 --> 33:42.019
May I see the blade, please?

33:42.021 --> 33:43.220
That bastard Mewes' role.

33:43.222 --> 33:45.022
Uh, he's-- he's enjoying this.

33:45.024 --> 33:46.390
I could see it in his eyes.

33:46.392 --> 33:48.158
Oh, for God's sakes, Harold.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.394
Man up, the blade's
not that bloody sharp.

33:54.767 --> 33:56.767
Lunch, everybody.

33:56.769 --> 33:57.734
Lunch, everybody!

33:57.736 --> 34:00.704
That's lunch.

34:00.706 --> 34:03.106
Right, I spent
three fucking years at RADA...

34:05.744 --> 34:09.212
Fucking silent,
fucking Sponge Bob thinks

34:09.214 --> 34:10.679
he's fucking Robert De Niro.

34:10.681 --> 34:13.717
Mr. Jason Mewes!

34:13.719 --> 34:15.552
A word please, sir.

34:18.090 --> 34:22.059
That was a very impressive
performance young man,

34:22.061 --> 34:23.193
very impressive.

34:23.195 --> 34:25.195
Thank you, sir.

34:25.196 --> 34:27.196
I can see
that look in your eyes.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.498
It's green,
it's fucking dynamite.

34:29.501 --> 34:33.437
No more Snoogans for you,
no, sir.

34:33.438 --> 34:37.440
This whole method thing
suits you very well.

34:37.443 --> 34:39.509
It brings out all
of your darkness.

34:39.511 --> 34:40.811
Oh yes.

34:43.282 --> 34:44.848
Snoochie boochies.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.315
Snoochie boochies.

34:46.318 --> 34:47.417
Snoochie boochies.

34:50.188 --> 34:52.822
I am the clit commander.

34:55.494 --> 34:57.327
Jason Mewes is back.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.196
Straight after getting arrested,

34:59.198 --> 35:01.231
Mewes landed a role
on Acupuncture Killer

35:01.233 --> 35:02.532
and the producers are--

35:05.337 --> 35:07.404
<i>I'm not even supposed
to be here right now.</i>

35:07.406 --> 35:09.573
Rumors are flying
all over Hollywood

35:09.575 --> 35:11.341
about who Brian O'Halloran
is going to cast

35:11.343 --> 35:12.776
in his movie <i> The Odyssey</i>,

35:12.778 --> 35:16.513
which is due
to start filming very soon.

35:16.515 --> 35:19.449
O'Halloran, fucker.

35:27.426 --> 35:29.126
<i>This is Brian O'Halloran.</i>

35:29.127 --> 35:30.827
<i>Clearly, I'm not supposed
to be here right now.</i>

35:30.828 --> 35:32.528
<i>So leave me a message
after the beep.</i>

35:32.531 --> 35:34.631
Stan tea, please.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.467
Hey, can you please uh,
maybe give me a call back

35:37.469 --> 35:39.136
or answer your phone?

35:40.639 --> 35:42.205
Thanks, brother.

35:42.207 --> 35:43.907
Fucker, man!

35:43.908 --> 35:45.608
He's-- track you down
and kick that ass.

35:45.611 --> 35:48.478
Oh shit.
Oh shit.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.446
Jay, it's me.

35:50.771 --> 35:52.093
It's me, Jason.

35:52.094 --> 35:53.416
Me?
Who-- who's me?

35:53.418 --> 35:55.318
- It's Dean.
- Dean Cain, whoa!

35:55.319 --> 35:57.219
Dude, no!
Sh-- shut up.

35:57.222 --> 35:58.455
If I get caught out here,
I'm gonna be signing shit

35:58.457 --> 36:00.390
for a month.

36:00.391 --> 36:02.324
Okay, you have no idea how fast
these fuckers mobilize.

36:02.327 --> 36:03.693
Yeah, dude,
it's great to see you, cuz,

36:03.695 --> 36:05.695
but I don't think anyone cares,
brother.

36:05.697 --> 36:07.297
I broke this fucking kid's heart
yesterday,

36:07.299 --> 36:08.498
because I couldn't fly.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.067
You can't fly?

36:10.068 --> 36:11.635
He wanted me to take off
right then and there.

36:11.637 --> 36:13.537
- Seriously?
- I shit you not.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.422
But it's pretty cool, dude,

36:15.423 --> 36:17.306
you have cemented yourself
into history.

36:17.309 --> 36:19.276
You played fucking Superman.

36:19.277 --> 36:21.244
I could negotiate peace
in the Middle East

36:21.246 --> 36:23.580
whilst unifying Korea
into one single harmonious state

36:23.582 --> 36:26.216
and figure out who shot JFK.

36:26.218 --> 36:28.652
And guess what they'd wanna
fucking talk to me about?

36:28.654 --> 36:30.287
That is sort of a bummer.

36:30.289 --> 36:33.190
I seem 'em in my dreams.

36:33.192 --> 36:34.624
The fan boys,
they are everywhere.

36:34.626 --> 36:37.260
I can't escape
even when I'm asleep.

36:37.262 --> 36:39.262
I'm gonna get shot one day

36:39.264 --> 36:40.263
and you know
what the last thing is

36:40.265 --> 36:41.698
that I'm gonna see?

36:41.700 --> 36:44.401
Um, Zod?

36:44.403 --> 36:45.669
It's gonna be
the disappointed face

36:45.671 --> 36:48.205
of some fanatic

36:48.206 --> 36:50.740
who is absolutely astounded
that I can't stop a bullet.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.742
Bullets, they fucking pierce me,
Jason.

36:52.744 --> 36:54.544
Fuck!

36:58.750 --> 37:00.550
So I hear
you've been busy lately.

37:00.551 --> 37:02.351
Yeah, dude, I just had
this sweet gig, man, that's--

37:02.354 --> 37:03.553
That's-- that's not
what I'm talking about.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.355
- Arrested.
- Oh.

37:05.357 --> 37:06.623
How's that working out for you?

37:06.625 --> 37:08.491
Really good, bro.

37:08.493 --> 37:10.093
I'm telling you like people
have seen me

37:10.094 --> 37:11.694
- in a whole different way.
- That's good, that's good.

37:11.697 --> 37:12.796
What have you got lined up next?

37:12.798 --> 37:15.015
Uh, nothing right now, but--

37:15.016 --> 37:17.233
Jason, you have to hit now
while the iron is hot, man.

37:17.236 --> 37:18.769
You need
to capitalize right now,

37:18.770 --> 37:20.303
get the roles
while you're benefiting

37:20.305 --> 37:22.005
from the extra profile.

37:22.006 --> 37:23.706
I'm actually trying to get this
script right now, right?

37:23.709 --> 37:25.742
- It's written by Brian O'--
- O'Halloran.

37:25.744 --> 37:26.994
- Yeah, right.
- You know it?

37:26.995 --> 37:28.245
Dude, everybody knows it.

37:28.247 --> 37:30.531
It's the talk of the town.

37:30.532 --> 37:32.816
They're already scheduling it
for an Oscar seasons release.

37:32.818 --> 37:35.385
Is-- is O'Halloran--
is he gonna hook you up?

37:35.387 --> 37:36.686
Well, I mean I'm hoping
that he's gonna hook me up

37:36.688 --> 37:38.104
with the lead.

37:38.105 --> 37:39.521
But wait, did you say Oscars,
bro?

37:39.524 --> 37:41.625
You--

37:43.262 --> 37:44.794
- What?
- Have you been behaving, Jason.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.229
Of course, I am.

37:46.230 --> 37:47.663
You're not back on the--
I mean, you know?

37:47.666 --> 37:50.267
No! No.

37:50.269 --> 37:51.334
Studio picture?

37:51.336 --> 37:53.069
You fucking kidding me?

37:53.070 --> 37:54.803
You think the studio
is gonna offer you the lead

37:54.806 --> 37:56.806
in an Oscar hopeful?

37:56.808 --> 37:59.743
Even if O'Halloran really goes
to bat for you,

37:59.745 --> 38:02.746
you still gotta get arrested
again for the extra headlines.

38:02.748 --> 38:03.847
Wait, what?

38:03.849 --> 38:05.482
Even if O'Halloran--

38:05.484 --> 38:06.683
No, no, no,
about the arrest thing.

38:06.685 --> 38:08.485
- Where do we--
- Hey!

38:08.487 --> 38:09.886
- Can I grab a quick picture?
- Oh, me?

38:09.888 --> 38:11.421
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sure, yeah.

38:11.423 --> 38:13.490
Hey, man, alright.

38:13.492 --> 38:16.526
So, alrighty.

38:16.528 --> 38:17.939
- Nice, bro.
- Awesome.

38:17.940 --> 38:19.351
- Pound it, pound it.
- Yeah, bro.

38:19.352 --> 38:20.763
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

38:20.766 --> 38:21.865
Yeah.

38:23.568 --> 38:25.335
Be careful, Jason.

38:25.337 --> 38:28.605
And don't do anything stupid,
it's not worth it.

38:28.607 --> 38:29.639
Alright, I know, that's good.

38:29.641 --> 38:30.907
You're gonna get up?

38:30.909 --> 38:32.342
No, no, I'm good.
I'm good here.

38:32.344 --> 38:33.376
Okay.

38:33.378 --> 38:34.344
I'll see you later, bro.

38:34.346 --> 38:35.662
Good to see you.

38:35.663 --> 38:36.979
Oh, c-- co--
could you get me my coffee?

38:39.885 --> 38:41.351
Here.

38:41.353 --> 38:42.452
Thanks.

38:45.324 --> 38:47.524
The LAPD is
a buzz today after news

38:47.526 --> 38:50.760
of a witness coming forward
in the Vinnie Jones murder case.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.662
Information is scarce
at this point,

38:52.664 --> 38:56.466
but our sources believe
the witness did see the murderer

38:56.468 --> 38:58.568
and will be able
to identify him.

38:58.570 --> 39:01.571
As of yet, we have no comment
from Mr. Jones's representatives

39:01.573 --> 39:03.473
or indeed from Jason Mewes,

39:03.475 --> 39:06.476
who was arrested
on the same morning as Jones.

39:06.478 --> 39:09.479
Stay with us as the day gets--

39:09.481 --> 39:11.581
Wait a second.

39:11.583 --> 39:14.017
I'm hearing
that we've located Mr. Mewes

39:14.019 --> 39:16.519
and our reporter Oliver
is with him live.

39:16.521 --> 39:17.554
Oliver?

39:17.556 --> 39:19.072
Mr. Mewes!

39:19.073 --> 39:20.589
How do you feel
about recent events

39:20.590 --> 39:22.106
regarding the murder case
of your good friend

39:22.107 --> 39:23.623
and notorious ball grabber
Vinnie Jones?

39:23.628 --> 39:25.195
A witness has come forward
to say

39:25.196 --> 39:26.763
they remember seeing the driver
on the night of the murder.

39:26.765 --> 39:28.081
Wait, what?

39:28.082 --> 39:29.398
Are you now willing to admit
that your good friend

39:29.399 --> 39:30.715
is a killer
and never actually let go

39:30.716 --> 39:32.032
of his British
gangland connections?

39:32.037 --> 39:34.671
Is it true Jones
has been a secret gangland boss

39:34.673 --> 39:36.656
terrorizing Hollywood?

39:36.657 --> 39:38.640
Does Vinnie get his movie roles
through intimidation?

39:38.643 --> 39:39.723
No way, he is a very nice guy--

39:39.724 --> 39:40.804
What are you not telling us,
Mr. Mewes?

39:40.805 --> 39:41.885
Mr. Mewes!
Mr. Mewes!

39:41.886 --> 39:42.966
- What are you not--
- Mr. Mewes!

39:42.967 --> 39:44.047
Mr. Mewes!

40:24.956 --> 40:26.523
Police are keeping
tightly sealed

40:26.525 --> 40:27.757
as to the identity
of the witness

40:27.759 --> 40:29.726
in the Vinnie Jones murder case,

40:29.727 --> 40:31.694
but many are speculating
as to who it could be.

40:31.696 --> 40:32.829
I mean it literally
could be anyone.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.030
LA is a really big place.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.698
It's not me.

40:39.838 --> 40:42.071
There he is.

40:43.975 --> 40:46.042
Alright, I'm...

40:46.044 --> 40:47.143
...just gonna warn him.

40:47.145 --> 40:48.611
Just warn him.

41:15.874 --> 41:16.940
Bro, it's okay.

41:16.942 --> 41:18.074
It's just...

41:18.076 --> 41:19.809
Don't be startled like, uh...

41:19.811 --> 41:20.743
Hey, bro, it's-- it's cool.

41:20.745 --> 41:21.744
Look, hey!

41:21.746 --> 41:23.062
It's cool.

41:23.063 --> 41:24.379
I just wanted to know
where Stan Lee lives.

41:24.380 --> 41:25.696
I know he lives close.

41:25.697 --> 41:27.013
I just need a little help
getting to his house.

41:27.018 --> 41:28.318
Fuck, don't you fucking move--

41:28.319 --> 41:29.619
Or I'll cut you, bitch.

41:29.621 --> 41:31.187
What are you doing?

41:31.188 --> 41:32.754
When they ask you
if you saw me that night

41:32.757 --> 41:34.757
you're gonna say you didn't.

41:34.759 --> 41:36.893
I d-- I-- I didn't see you.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.361
Wait, what?

41:38.362 --> 41:39.828
No, I-- I thought I saw
that British soccer guy

41:39.831 --> 41:41.064
they keep putting on the news.

41:41.066 --> 41:42.732
It was dark I th--

41:42.734 --> 41:44.033
I saw...

41:46.771 --> 41:48.271
- Hey!
- No!

41:48.273 --> 41:50.240
I thought you were giving me
a warning.

41:50.242 --> 41:52.242
- But I am.
- You're trying to kill me.

41:52.244 --> 41:54.844
No, no, no,
you were trying to run away.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.279
You're that silent Jay guy.

41:57.516 --> 41:58.515
Whoa!

42:00.252 --> 42:02.785
Look, what you made me do!

42:02.787 --> 42:04.921
Oh, I need 911, 911!

42:04.923 --> 42:05.822
Oh, here, let me get it for you.

42:13.298 --> 42:15.532
Oh fuck!

42:15.534 --> 42:17.967
I need an amb-- ambulance.

42:17.969 --> 42:19.068
- Shit, dude, alright.
- God, I'm dying.

42:19.070 --> 42:20.670
Dude, that should be okay.

42:20.671 --> 42:22.271
What-- what, um,
what street is this, again?

42:22.274 --> 42:26.075
It's Maple Boulevard,
you fucking asshole!

42:26.077 --> 42:27.677
Holy shit!

42:27.678 --> 42:29.278
That was your face that night.

42:29.281 --> 42:30.880
It's coming back to me.

42:30.882 --> 42:32.048
I'm gonna make you fucking pay.

42:32.050 --> 42:34.067
I'm gonna tell 'em what you did.

42:34.068 --> 42:36.085
I'm gonna make you fucking pay,
you bastard!

42:36.087 --> 42:38.187
You're looking pretty pale, bro.

42:38.189 --> 42:41.958
Are you fucking kidding me?

42:41.960 --> 42:43.426
No, no, don't g--

42:43.427 --> 42:44.893
Don't go, don't go away, please,
come back.

42:44.896 --> 42:46.229
Call an ambulance please.

42:46.231 --> 42:48.131
I didn't see anything
that night, man.

42:48.133 --> 42:49.366
I don't know--
I don't know your face.

42:49.367 --> 42:50.600
I don't know what you look like.

42:50.601 --> 42:51.834
I've never seen any
of your movies.

42:51.836 --> 42:54.721
That's good.

42:54.722 --> 42:57.607
I wasn't even supposed
to be here today, bro.

42:57.609 --> 42:59.142
What are you doing?

42:59.144 --> 43:01.177
What are you--

43:01.179 --> 43:02.211
Oh!

43:02.213 --> 43:03.396
No, no, no, no.

43:03.397 --> 43:04.580
Pleased don't--
don't do that.

43:04.583 --> 43:06.049
Don't-- don't--

43:06.051 --> 43:08.117
Put that in your pocket,
go put it in your pocket.

43:08.119 --> 43:09.919
Put it away, put it away!

43:09.921 --> 43:11.220
Oh, oh, no.

43:11.222 --> 43:12.889
Please, don't.

43:12.891 --> 43:14.624
Ow, shit!

43:14.626 --> 43:16.292
Why did you do that?

43:16.294 --> 43:18.628
Look, dude, I was just here
to warn you, bro.

43:18.630 --> 43:21.898
It don't come natural to me,
I'm not a cold-blooded killer!

43:21.900 --> 43:24.200
I'm f--

43:24.202 --> 43:27.003
I feel like...

43:27.005 --> 43:29.305
I'm dizzy.

43:29.307 --> 43:31.874
Oh shit.

43:31.876 --> 43:33.626
What am I doing?

43:33.627 --> 43:35.377
I almost fucking actually killed
this motherfucker on purpose.

43:35.380 --> 43:37.313
Oh God,
what the fuck am I doing?

43:37.315 --> 43:39.015
What the fuck!

43:39.017 --> 43:40.016
Wait a second.

43:40.018 --> 43:42.018
Wait.

43:42.020 --> 43:45.221
Vinnie's in jail.

43:45.223 --> 43:46.990
They're gonna know
it wasn't him.

44:10.315 --> 44:13.249
Okay, that's right.

44:14.602 --> 44:15.952
Shit! Holy fuck!

44:17.122 --> 44:18.121
Holy fuck!

44:18.123 --> 44:19.656
Holy fuck!

44:20.959 --> 44:23.059
Holy sh--

44:23.061 --> 44:25.194
Holy shit.

44:25.196 --> 44:26.729
Breathe out, man.

44:47.218 --> 44:48.818
Oh, come, man.

44:50.755 --> 44:52.822
Oof!

44:52.824 --> 44:54.123
- Excuse me?
- Whoa!

44:54.125 --> 44:55.675
Dude.

44:55.676 --> 44:57.226
What the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

44:57.228 --> 44:58.728
Well, what's wrong with you,
bro?

44:58.730 --> 45:00.229
What the fuck is wrong with you,
bro?

45:00.231 --> 45:01.853
Who-- who are you?

45:01.854 --> 45:03.476
I have fucking nerve issues,
man.

45:03.477 --> 45:05.099
You can't just randomly scream
in people's faces.

45:05.103 --> 45:06.469
You don't know me,
you could've killed me, man.

45:06.471 --> 45:08.071
So you're a security officer.

45:08.073 --> 45:10.106
I'm the fucking
security officer.

45:10.108 --> 45:13.142
George Abrahams,
security officer.

45:13.144 --> 45:15.378
A security officer
with nerve issues.

45:15.380 --> 45:16.913
Dude, I'm-- I'm a fucking--

45:16.914 --> 45:18.447
I'm a security guard machine,
sir.

45:18.450 --> 45:21.250
I'm like a 365° radar, man.

45:21.252 --> 45:22.752
I see all the angles, dog.

45:22.754 --> 45:23.853
You can't get past me.

45:23.855 --> 45:25.555
Well, I apologize for that,

45:25.556 --> 45:27.256
because I do need
to see Ferrango, man.

45:27.258 --> 45:28.758
Can't do it.

45:28.760 --> 45:30.660
I have to warn him.

45:30.661 --> 45:32.561
What do you have
to warn him about?

45:32.562 --> 45:34.462
There's a-- a Latina girl,
and a couple of her friends,

45:34.466 --> 45:36.299
and I passed them
when I was coming here.

45:36.301 --> 45:38.134
Fuck,
they're dangerous in a group.

45:38.136 --> 45:39.268
- Yeah.
- Shit.

45:39.270 --> 45:41.537
Which direction?

45:41.538 --> 45:43.805
Uh, that way,
about three blocks.

45:45.510 --> 45:48.277
- Thanks, dude.
- Cool.

45:57.889 --> 45:59.789
I got your knight.

45:59.791 --> 46:01.290
You know what that means.

46:06.297 --> 46:09.365
Ay este pendejo!

46:09.367 --> 46:11.267
You've been reading it too fast.

46:11.269 --> 46:12.935
I can tell just by looking
at you.

46:12.937 --> 46:14.403
What page are you on?

46:14.405 --> 46:15.905
I-- I don't know,
like 200.

46:15.907 --> 46:17.974
C--

46:32.223 --> 46:34.257
Hey, hey, snap out of it.

46:34.259 --> 46:36.459
What did I tell about keeping
those feelings in check?

46:37.796 --> 46:39.462
Just-- just go home.
Go home.

46:39.464 --> 46:41.014
Sleep it off.

46:41.015 --> 46:42.565
Forget about the book
for a couple of weeks.

46:42.567 --> 46:44.517
It's working a little bit.

46:44.518 --> 46:46.468
- It's sort of work--
- I am so sorry, Mr. Villareal.

46:46.471 --> 46:47.970
He-- he snucked past me.

46:47.972 --> 46:50.006
You Brutus
motherfucking Spoodle.

46:50.008 --> 46:51.340
It's okay, it's okay.

46:51.342 --> 46:52.575
Mewes! Mewes!

46:52.577 --> 46:54.844
You have to relax, man.

46:54.846 --> 46:56.579
Process everything
that's going on

46:56.581 --> 46:59.048
before you go loco.

47:59.878 --> 48:01.978
Damn Hollywood.

48:01.979 --> 48:04.079
All these actors are turning it
into a warzone.

48:04.082 --> 48:06.082
But these guys
covered their tracks.

48:06.084 --> 48:07.984
Definitely some madness
in their method.

48:07.986 --> 48:11.153
It's method in the madness,
you idiot.

48:11.155 --> 48:13.606
Fair enough.

48:13.607 --> 48:16.058
You do know that Jason Mewes
is linked to this case, right?

48:16.060 --> 48:18.077
He is?

48:18.078 --> 48:20.095
He was arrested the same day
as Vinnie Jones.

48:20.098 --> 48:22.164
But don't you know Jason Mewes?

48:22.166 --> 48:23.633
Jason Mewes?

48:23.635 --> 48:25.635
That smoochie boochie guy?

48:25.637 --> 48:28.037
Yes, the snoochie boochie guy.
Yeah, that guy.

48:28.039 --> 48:31.507
I never met him, but, boy,
I heard he's a knucklehead.

48:31.509 --> 48:33.142
Well, we all can't be saints.

48:34.913 --> 48:36.445
Oh crap,
here comes the detective.

48:36.447 --> 48:38.547
Look, I uh, I got nothing good
to tell him here.

48:38.549 --> 48:39.548
You might wanna--

48:39.550 --> 48:40.683
Enough said.

48:40.685 --> 48:42.018
I'm out of here.

48:42.020 --> 48:43.470
Upward and onward, Jim.

48:43.471 --> 48:44.921
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, onward and upward.

48:44.923 --> 48:46.489
Wayne!

48:46.491 --> 48:48.257
Wayne.

48:48.259 --> 48:49.458
Good--

48:50.554 --> 48:51.647
Good to see you, sir.

48:51.648 --> 48:52.741
Who's that?

48:52.742 --> 48:53.835
Oh, this is Stan Lee.

48:53.836 --> 48:54.929
- He's the neighbor.
- Legend.

48:54.933 --> 48:56.716
Yeah. Yes, he is.

48:56.717 --> 48:58.500
Shut up,
give me some good news.

48:58.503 --> 48:59.903
I got nothing.

48:59.904 --> 49:01.304
This guy was either
a professional

49:01.305 --> 49:02.705
or he was
one lucky son of a bitch.

49:02.707 --> 49:04.349
You have the murder weapon?

49:04.350 --> 49:05.992
My guys are
searching the area right now,

49:05.993 --> 49:07.635
but I'll be honest with you,
Wayne,

49:07.636 --> 49:09.278
I don't think we're gonna have
positive results.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.614
If this was gangland,
they're not sloppy.

49:11.616 --> 49:13.082
We're not gonna find shit.

49:13.084 --> 49:14.517
Go.

49:14.519 --> 49:16.485
Fucking idiot.

49:18.623 --> 49:20.556
You motherfucker!

49:23.561 --> 49:25.094
Something's definitely
not right.

49:31.469 --> 49:32.115
- Jason.
- What?

49:32.116 --> 49:32.762
...the most recent
incident in the Jones murder case.

49:32.763 --> 49:33.409
Over to Oliver
for all the latest.

49:33.410 --> 49:34.056
We now have confirmation
that the body of the victim

49:34.057 --> 49:34.703
is principal witness
in the Vinnie Jones murder case.

49:34.706 --> 49:37.106
LAPD sources are also telling us
the body of the victim

49:37.108 --> 49:39.976
was found with a symbol carved
into its chest.

49:39.978 --> 49:41.528
Rumor has it that this symbol

49:41.529 --> 49:43.079
is a British gangland
murder tag,

49:43.081 --> 49:44.680
indicating an execution.

49:44.682 --> 49:46.315
As you can see
from the police photos,

49:46.317 --> 49:48.284
Mr. Jones does have
a gangland scar

49:48.286 --> 49:49.685
on his chest.

49:49.687 --> 49:51.153
Whether this links him
to the murder

49:51.155 --> 49:54.090
only time will tell.

49:54.092 --> 49:55.992
Do you really think that
Vinnie had something to do

49:55.994 --> 49:57.727
- with these murders?
- You know what?

49:57.729 --> 50:00.096
I'm sort of distracting myself
from it all.

50:00.098 --> 50:01.431
Huh.

50:01.432 --> 50:02.765
You know, do whatever makes you
feel good.

50:02.767 --> 50:04.723
Hmm.

50:04.724 --> 50:06.680
And then maybe
while you're at it

50:06.681 --> 50:08.637
you could fix the roof
like you've been promising.

50:08.639 --> 50:11.374
Oh, I have to buy a nail gun,
so...

50:11.376 --> 50:14.610
If you go now, you can be back
before the party.

50:14.612 --> 50:16.679
- Party?
- You forgot about the party.

50:16.681 --> 50:18.214
You know that Kevin
doesn't wanna go

50:18.216 --> 50:19.682
to Esteban's by himself.

50:23.388 --> 50:25.688
Snoochie boochies.

50:25.690 --> 50:27.056
Snoochie boochies.

50:31.763 --> 50:34.397
I am the clit commander.

50:37.235 --> 50:39.301
Jason Mewes
continues his unlikely rise

50:39.303 --> 50:40.803
up the Movie Star Rating charts

50:40.805 --> 50:43.039
as he finds himself back
in the headlines

50:43.041 --> 50:45.441
after the Vinnie Jones witness
was found murdered overnight.

50:45.443 --> 50:47.109
Yes.

50:49.146 --> 50:51.180
I'm not even supposed
to be here right now.

50:53.317 --> 50:55.418
Brian O'Halloran has confirmed
shooting on <i> The Odyssey</i>

50:55.420 --> 50:57.319
is set to begin
at the start of next month,

50:57.321 --> 50:59.755
which means a cast announcement
must be imminent

50:59.757 --> 51:01.724
as it seems half of Hollywood
wants in

51:01.726 --> 51:03.793
on the likely Oscar contender.

51:03.795 --> 51:06.128
I'm closing in on you,
motherfucker.

51:06.130 --> 51:08.731
Carrie,
I'm going out to buy a nail gun.

51:22.146 --> 51:23.902
Chief Anderson.

51:23.903 --> 51:25.659
<i>Chief, detective Arnold here.</i>

51:25.660 --> 51:27.416
What is it, detective?

51:27.418 --> 51:28.734
<i>I wanna bring Jason Mewes back in.</i>

51:28.735 --> 51:30.051
You already questioned Mewes
and got nothing.

51:30.052 --> 51:31.368
You repeat that process

51:31.369 --> 51:32.685
and what does this department
look like to the press?

51:32.690 --> 51:35.424
<i>Oh, come on, he's gonna talk.</i>

51:35.425 --> 51:38.159
<i>- I just need him to--</i>
<i>-</i> Drop it, detective.

51:38.162 --> 51:39.328
Do you understand me?

51:39.329 --> 51:40.495
<i>Alright, chief, whatever you say.</i>

51:40.496 --> 51:41.662
<i>Sure.</i>

51:52.210 --> 51:53.442
Hey, babe.

51:55.313 --> 51:58.447
Yes, of course,
I'll be home about 8:00

51:58.449 --> 52:01.250
and I have the new handcuffs.

52:18.336 --> 52:20.136
Something just isn't right.

52:25.642 --> 52:26.908
Producers are raving
about the daily footage coming

52:26.911 --> 52:29.478
from the Acupuncture Killer set,
explaining Jason Mewes

52:29.480 --> 52:31.147
is doing incredible work

52:31.149 --> 52:32.648
and getting arrested
was the best thing

52:32.650 --> 52:35.101
that could have happened
to his career.

52:35.102 --> 52:37.553
Otherwise, they never would have
thought of him for the role.

52:40.191 --> 52:41.590
Tommy, could you tell me

52:41.592 --> 52:43.592
where that Costalino guy worked,
again?

53:03.681 --> 53:06.315
Wait, what?
What the fuck did I just see?

53:06.317 --> 53:07.950
- Excuse me?
- Answer the question.

53:07.952 --> 53:09.318
I'm not your eyeballs, Jason.

53:09.320 --> 53:10.319
What were you just doing?

53:10.321 --> 53:11.971
Skyping a girlfriend.

53:11.972 --> 53:13.622
- What girlfriend is that?
- Megan from Europe.

53:13.624 --> 53:16.192
Megan in Europe wanted
to see your titties?

53:16.194 --> 53:17.560
What are you talking about?

53:17.562 --> 53:19.328
When I walked through the door,

53:19.330 --> 53:21.197
you were flashing your titties
to the camera.

53:21.199 --> 53:23.199
You've been acting
fucking crazy.

53:23.201 --> 53:24.767
Is this what I'm gonna
have to deal

53:24.768 --> 53:26.334
with every single time you're up
for some Hollywood role?

53:26.337 --> 53:29.572
I need the old Jay back.

53:29.574 --> 53:30.739
Silent Bob, too?

53:30.741 --> 53:32.474
Fuck you!

53:32.476 --> 53:33.976
I want the man
I fell in love with.

53:33.978 --> 53:35.211
That's weird, 'cause you've been
a little distant

53:35.213 --> 53:37.096
from him lately.

53:37.097 --> 53:38.980
Jason, you're being
fucking paranoid, okay?

53:38.983 --> 53:41.117
It's me.

53:41.118 --> 53:43.252
You would love for me
to believe that, wouldn't you?

53:44.755 --> 53:46.255
Where are you going?

53:46.256 --> 53:47.756
Getting ready for the party.

54:18.789 --> 54:20.456
Hello, hello!

54:20.458 --> 54:22.658
Jason Mewes.

54:22.660 --> 54:24.426
Danny Trejo, I didn't know
you'd be here

54:24.428 --> 54:25.461
and what-- what's the--

54:26.897 --> 54:28.330
I'm method acting
for a new role now,

54:28.332 --> 54:29.531
just run with it cabron,
alright?

54:29.533 --> 54:31.300
Yeah, but, I don't--

54:31.302 --> 54:33.535
I thought you'd be here
with your little Carrie.

54:33.537 --> 54:35.704
She took her separate car,
she's gonna meet me here, but--

54:35.706 --> 54:38.540
That better not be trouble
in paradise, I'm sensing, is it?

54:38.542 --> 54:40.509
No, no, everything's good,
I promise.

54:40.511 --> 54:42.411
Are you sure? 'Cause you know
you can talk to me.

54:42.413 --> 54:44.546
I know, but I do not get like--
are you su--

54:44.548 --> 54:47.449
Look, I've been wanting to have
a little chitty chatty poo

54:47.451 --> 54:48.818
- with you.
- A little--

54:48.819 --> 54:50.186
a little chitty chat?

54:50.187 --> 54:51.554
Let's do it.
What's up?

54:51.555 --> 54:52.922
Well, I've been hearing

54:52.923 --> 54:54.290
about you having trouble
with the ball grabber.

54:54.292 --> 54:55.692
The ball grabber?

54:55.693 --> 54:57.093
That's what they call him.

54:57.094 --> 54:58.494
And you know,
I worry about you, Jason.

54:58.496 --> 55:00.829
- You know that.
- I know.

55:00.831 --> 55:02.431
If that motherfucker fucks
with you,

55:02.433 --> 55:04.500
I'll cut his fucking heart out.

55:04.502 --> 55:05.934
Shit, Dan--
I mean I appreciate that.

55:05.936 --> 55:07.303
Thank you.

55:07.305 --> 55:08.570
You know
what they call me?

55:08.572 --> 55:09.772
Machete, right?

55:09.774 --> 55:11.373
You know why?

55:11.375 --> 55:13.409
Uh, because of the movie.

55:13.411 --> 55:15.311
Because I got a big
motherfucking machete,

55:15.313 --> 55:16.312
that's why.

55:16.314 --> 55:18.547
A big machete.

55:18.549 --> 55:20.549
Harley Quinn Smith!

55:20.551 --> 55:22.484
Oh, as I live and breathe.

55:22.486 --> 55:24.820
- Danny.
- Oh, be still my heart.

55:24.822 --> 55:26.522
Danny,
I didn't expect to see you here.

55:26.524 --> 55:28.590
Why does everybody
keep saying that?

55:28.592 --> 55:30.426
Can't a little girl
have some fun?

55:30.428 --> 55:32.528
Dude, you're here
to pick Kevin up?

55:32.529 --> 55:34.629
Yeah, I think he's enjoying
my new license more than I am.

55:34.632 --> 55:35.964
Harley, oh my God!

55:35.966 --> 55:37.466
Hi.

55:37.467 --> 55:38.967
- Can we take a selfie?
- Of course.

55:38.969 --> 55:40.736
Alright, I'm gonna go ahead,
alright, Harley.

55:40.738 --> 55:41.870
- Bye.
- Uh, will you tell dad

55:41.872 --> 55:43.622
that I'm waiting.

55:43.623 --> 55:45.373
I'm too scared to go and I feel
like I'll never escape.

55:45.376 --> 55:47.026
No problem, no problem.

55:47.027 --> 55:48.677
Remember, it's not gay
as long as the balls

55:48.679 --> 55:50.012
don't touch the chin.

55:53.751 --> 55:54.983
Oh nice!
That's gonna be a keeper.

55:54.985 --> 55:56.585
Pleasure.
Nice meeting you, man.

55:56.587 --> 55:57.953
Sir!

55:57.954 --> 55:59.320
Where the fuck have you been,
dude?

55:59.321 --> 56:00.687
Where the fuck have you been?

56:00.691 --> 56:01.790
Wait,
what are you talking about?

56:01.792 --> 56:03.609
Don't fucking act like that.

56:03.610 --> 56:05.427
Like you don't think I was gonna
fucking find out, man.

56:05.429 --> 56:07.496
Motherfucker,
that shit is written

56:07.498 --> 56:09.431
all over your face,
the goddamn guilt.

56:09.433 --> 56:12.434
You didn't think I'd know.

56:12.436 --> 56:13.986
What are you talking about?

56:13.987 --> 56:15.537
I'm talking about you up
in that house sucking dick,

56:15.539 --> 56:16.839
'cause I can see the cum
right there.

56:16.841 --> 56:19.508
- None!
- Oh, shit!

56:19.510 --> 56:20.809
Hey, you remember
when we jerked each other off

56:20.811 --> 56:21.844
in the pool?

56:21.846 --> 56:23.546
That's a great memory.

56:23.547 --> 56:25.247
- Did you get that book?
- I did.

56:25.248 --> 56:26.948
I read the book, dude,
and it is taking my craft

56:26.951 --> 56:28.184
on a whole another level.

56:28.185 --> 56:29.418
It's awesome.
Thank you.

56:29.419 --> 56:30.652
Right on, man.
Fuck, you know what, dude?

56:30.654 --> 56:32.304
Fuck all that holy shit.

56:32.305 --> 56:33.955
I was just thinking,
Vinnie Jones.

56:33.958 --> 56:35.657
What the fuck, man?

56:35.659 --> 56:36.859
Don't shit in the pool.

56:37.915 --> 56:38.968
Maybe he did have something
to do

56:38.969 --> 56:40.022
with that casting director.

56:40.023 --> 56:41.076
You know what I'm saying?

56:41.077 --> 56:42.130
I'm serious,
don't shit in the pool.

56:42.133 --> 56:44.533
Brian O'Halloran here?
Do you know if he showed up?

56:44.535 --> 56:45.588
Are you serious?

56:45.589 --> 56:46.642
I'm talking
about fucking Vinnie Jones,

56:46.643 --> 56:47.696
you're talking about Bri--

56:47.697 --> 56:48.750
Yeah, Brian O'Halloran
is fucking here,

56:48.751 --> 56:49.804
I passed him on the way in.

56:49.807 --> 56:51.140
Captain clitoris.

56:51.141 --> 56:52.474
Oh!

56:52.475 --> 56:53.808
I'm gonna go talk to him
about that--

56:53.811 --> 56:55.978
Wait, Harley Quinn came here
to pick you up.

56:55.980 --> 56:56.979
She's out front.
Sorry--

56:56.981 --> 56:58.439
My fucking kid's here.

56:58.440 --> 56:59.898
Why are we sitting here talking?

56:59.899 --> 57:01.357
Let's get the fuck out of here,
bitch.

57:01.358 --> 57:02.816
Jay and Silent Bob,
it's been a while.

57:02.820 --> 57:04.320
- Hey!
- Hey!

57:04.321 --> 57:05.821
Thank you so much
for coming to my party.

57:05.823 --> 57:07.756
Our party.

57:07.758 --> 57:09.758
Oh my God,
I had a fucking blast.

57:09.760 --> 57:11.410
We've just been sitting
here talking,

57:11.411 --> 57:13.061
he was upstairs having
misadventures in the house

57:13.063 --> 57:14.096
and shit.

57:14.098 --> 57:16.582
But I'm gonna go.

57:16.583 --> 57:19.067
I got a-- a podcast to record
and I gotta light out of here.

57:19.069 --> 57:20.102
I got like nine podcasts.

57:20.104 --> 57:21.103
So I've loved being here.

57:21.105 --> 57:22.927
Thanks for having us.

57:22.928 --> 57:24.750
But-- but we're
just getting started.

57:24.751 --> 57:26.573
Sadly, I got my kid
sweating in the car like a dog

57:26.577 --> 57:28.644
and I should probably go before
she overheats and dies.

57:28.646 --> 57:29.812
- Pleasure!
- Thank you.

57:29.814 --> 57:33.081
- Pleasure.
- Uh.

57:33.083 --> 57:35.717
Sorry to hear
about the break-up, fellows.

57:35.719 --> 57:37.186
Conscious uncoupling.

57:37.187 --> 57:38.654
Jason, what are you doing
next Tuesday?

57:38.656 --> 57:41.056
Jason is more my friend
than he is yours.

57:41.058 --> 57:42.624
You already got too clingy
with Brian

57:42.626 --> 57:44.593
and now he's leaving.
Kevin just left.

57:44.595 --> 57:46.295
At this rate,
we're not gonna have

57:46.296 --> 57:47.996
any famous people at our party!

57:47.997 --> 57:49.697
Brian's leaving,
I gotta catch up with him.

57:49.700 --> 57:51.711
Look what you did?

57:51.712 --> 57:53.723
My famous friends
mean the world to me

57:53.724 --> 57:55.735
and you-- you give
the world's worst blowjob.

57:55.739 --> 57:56.805
Mmhmm.

57:56.806 --> 57:57.872
That's not
what your father said.

57:59.743 --> 58:01.499
Not even
supposed to be here today.

58:01.500 --> 58:03.256
No, no, no, no, it's more like,

58:03.257 --> 58:05.013
"I'm not even supposed
to be here today."

58:05.015 --> 58:08.851
See the emphasis is stronger
at the start.

58:08.853 --> 58:10.752
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

58:10.754 --> 58:11.753
There you go.

58:11.755 --> 58:14.006
Much better.

58:14.007 --> 58:16.258
You know, I keep all my emotions
like right here,

58:16.260 --> 58:18.760
- on the surface.
- Hmm.

58:18.762 --> 58:21.096
Stored and ready for action.

58:21.098 --> 58:22.731
Hmm.

58:24.702 --> 58:29.004
It allows me to access
whatever my director needs.

58:29.006 --> 58:30.706
Totally amazing.

58:30.708 --> 58:34.843
For example um, pleasure.

58:38.682 --> 58:41.984
Oh yeah, I like pleasure.

58:41.986 --> 58:44.052
That makes two of us.

58:47.024 --> 58:49.291
Brian, hey, what's up, baby?

58:49.293 --> 58:50.453
- Oh, hey.
- How you doing?

58:50.454 --> 58:51.614
Jay, man,
how you doing?

58:51.615 --> 58:52.775
I'm good, man. How are you?

58:52.776 --> 58:53.936
It's been a while.

58:53.937 --> 58:55.097
Uh, how is everything
since the arrest

58:55.099 --> 58:56.615
and all that?

58:56.616 --> 58:58.132
Oh, yes, actually not that bad.

58:58.133 --> 58:59.649
I've gotten some really
interesting roles,

58:59.650 --> 59:01.166
because of the press
and the publicity.

59:01.171 --> 59:02.688
It's made it like whoa--

59:02.689 --> 59:04.206
Oh, dude, dude,
be careful with that press, yo.

59:04.207 --> 59:05.724
You know how it can turn
on you, you know that.

59:05.725 --> 59:07.242
Oh yeah, but-- hey,
has Kevin spoken to you

59:07.244 --> 59:08.922
about <i> The Odyssey</i> ?

59:08.923 --> 59:10.601
You know, I'm confident we could
slide you in there.

59:10.602 --> 59:12.280
Just give me a chance to talk
to the-- to the studio.

59:12.283 --> 59:13.471
You're serious?

59:13.472 --> 59:14.660
Dude, how long have I known you?

59:14.661 --> 59:15.849
Of course, I'm serious.

59:15.853 --> 59:17.052
Don't worry, Jay,
I got your back.

59:17.054 --> 59:18.637
It's so crazy, dude.

59:18.638 --> 59:20.221
People were saying,
"Even if you can convince Brian

59:20.224 --> 59:22.291
that you can carry
this studio movie,

59:22.293 --> 59:23.904
he's never gonna
convince the studio

59:23.905 --> 59:25.516
- to let you play the lead."
- Whoa, whoa, I-- I'm sorry.

59:25.517 --> 59:27.128
Dude, you remember we were
talking about it on <i> Dogma</i>

59:27.131 --> 59:28.297
so many years ago?

59:28.299 --> 59:30.265
I knew then I was like perfect--

59:30.267 --> 59:32.284
- Shit, Jay, Jay.
- For the part, dude.

59:32.285 --> 59:34.302
Shit, Jay, um, I-- I--
I didn't know that you--

59:34.305 --> 59:35.904
Were you thinking
I was talking about the lead?

59:35.906 --> 59:37.256
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Marcus, sorry dude.

59:37.257 --> 59:38.607
The-- the--
remember the similarities

59:38.609 --> 59:39.875
to me and him--

59:39.877 --> 59:41.176
And how much we are alike.

59:41.178 --> 59:42.144
- Shit, bro, I--
- I am--

59:43.702 --> 59:45.257
I was thinking more
of a few lines

59:45.258 --> 59:46.813
li-- like--
like a cameo or something.

59:46.817 --> 59:48.228
What?
You don't think I'm capable?

59:48.229 --> 59:49.640
- I'm capable, bro, like--
- No, no, no, no, no.

59:49.641 --> 59:51.052
Listen, um, I gotta run.

59:51.055 --> 59:53.355
Uh, what I'll do is
I'll call the studio

59:53.357 --> 59:55.857
and I'll persuade them
to bring you in

59:55.859 --> 59:57.175
for an audition or something.

59:57.176 --> 59:58.492
- Yeah, an audition.
- Yeah, yeah?

59:58.493 --> 59:59.809
Sure, yeah, yeah,
sounds great.

59:59.810 --> 01:00:01.126
Alright,
I'll talk to you again.

01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:04.722
- Thanks.
- We'll be in touch, alright?

01:00:04.723 --> 01:00:08.314
Yeah, thanks, man.

01:00:16.313 --> 01:00:18.113
Oh, if you'll excuse me,
I'll be right back.

01:00:24.188 --> 01:00:25.253
Uh, Jason.

01:00:25.255 --> 01:00:26.888
I'm so sorry about Tim.

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:29.057
Frankly, I'm embarrassed.

01:00:29.059 --> 01:00:30.692
Oh, we should take a selfie
while you're here.

01:00:30.694 --> 01:00:33.045
You could tweet it to me.

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:35.397
My handle's @EstebanJovi
♪ blessed♪earthtoJason.

01:00:35.399 --> 01:00:37.633
Hi, welcome to my party.
I'm talking to--

01:00:37.635 --> 01:00:40.168
Dude, don't fucking touch me,
I'll kill you!

01:00:46.043 --> 01:00:47.175
Baby, you were so brave.

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:48.176
I know.

01:00:48.178 --> 01:00:50.596
Jason!

01:00:50.597 --> 01:00:53.015
Don't forget what I told you,
watch out for that ball grabber.

01:00:55.085 --> 01:00:56.318
Brian!

01:00:58.222 --> 01:00:59.655
Brian!

01:01:41.432 --> 01:01:43.365
Officer Arnold.

01:01:43.367 --> 01:01:45.467
It's detective.

01:01:45.469 --> 01:01:47.369
What can I help you
with, my friend?

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:49.337
How exactly did you know

01:01:49.339 --> 01:01:53.041
the casting director
Anthony Costalino?

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:54.443
I didn't.

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:55.844
Uh, I think the first time
I heard his name

01:01:55.846 --> 01:01:57.112
was when you arrested me.

01:01:58.449 --> 01:01:59.848
That's-- that's funny.

01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:01.633
That's funny, you know why?

01:02:01.634 --> 01:02:03.417
'Cause I called the studio
and they told me

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:07.122
that you are in a casting
with him that day.

01:02:07.124 --> 01:02:09.174
Uh.

01:02:09.175 --> 01:02:11.225
Um, I uh, well, I must--
must have forgot.

01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:12.894
- I get a lot of--
- You must have.

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:15.097
Call m-- a lot of casting calls.

01:02:15.099 --> 01:02:16.865
Oh, it's just a big coincidence,
right?

01:02:16.867 --> 01:02:18.389
Yeah, it must have been,
I guess--

01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:19.912
But the thing is
I don't fucking believe

01:02:19.913 --> 01:02:21.435
in coincidences, motherfucker.

01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:23.171
And when I get enough evidence
on you,

01:02:23.173 --> 01:02:24.406
I'm gonna bury you
and put you away

01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:26.141
for a very long time.

01:02:27.511 --> 01:02:28.443
Cool, man, what the fuck?

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.913
What the fuck, man?

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:33.415
Sleep well, Mewes.

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:36.785
Your days of a free man
are slowly--

01:02:36.787 --> 01:02:38.754
Dwindling--
fuck!

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:47.763
Geena!

01:02:47.765 --> 01:02:49.765
Geena!

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.766
Hey, Geena, I need to speak
to you urgently!

01:02:51.769 --> 01:02:53.468
Jesus, Mary's cunt!

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:55.904
You scared five years off of me,
asshole.

01:02:55.906 --> 01:02:57.239
Have you ever thought
about smoking

01:02:57.241 --> 01:02:59.775
a little marijuana?

01:02:59.777 --> 01:03:01.777
It might settle you down
a touch.

01:03:01.779 --> 01:03:05.447
I need s-- uh, some quick gigs,
preferably cash, big earners.

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:07.432
You need lots of money and fast.

01:03:07.433 --> 01:03:09.416
How about a fricking knighthood
while I'm at it, Sir Jason.

01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:11.453
I'm serious, Geena.

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:13.488
What happened to uh,
"I only want to do serious shit,

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:15.791
no more Snagins fucking goochy"?

01:03:15.793 --> 01:03:16.792
I just might need
some quick cash

01:03:16.794 --> 01:03:17.859
for something coming up.

01:03:17.861 --> 01:03:19.261
Christ, Jason, what?

01:03:19.263 --> 01:03:20.328
Hey, do you have
that lawyer's number

01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:21.329
and can I have it?

01:03:21.331 --> 01:03:23.198
You need to calm down.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:26.434
No, you need to give me a gig,
earn that percentage.

01:03:37.014 --> 01:03:38.814
Excuse me.

01:03:38.816 --> 01:03:40.065
Shit!

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:41.315
- Fuck!
- Fuck you!

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:43.185
- Shit!
- What the fuck is wrong

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:45.053
with you fucking people, man,
this is shit.

01:03:45.055 --> 01:03:47.389
Trying to get yourself
fucking killed?

01:03:47.391 --> 01:03:49.858
You trying to get yourself
fucking killed?

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:50.892
Give me the code.

01:03:52.396 --> 01:03:54.296
No.

01:03:54.298 --> 01:03:55.330
What are you doing?

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:56.364
Give me the fucking code.

01:03:56.366 --> 01:03:57.866
5-6-3-3-7-5--

01:03:57.868 --> 01:03:59.267
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:01.036
Put it in
with your fucking tongue.

01:04:01.038 --> 01:04:02.003
- My tongue?
- Yes!

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:03.205
Okay.

01:04:03.206 --> 01:04:04.406
- Are you sure?
- Do it!

01:04:04.407 --> 01:04:05.607
- Okay.
- Now.

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:08.009
It's open.

01:04:09.847 --> 01:04:10.879
Thanks.

01:04:10.881 --> 01:04:12.848
You're welcome.

01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:14.015
Is it just straight down?

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:15.584
Yeah, yeah, to the left.

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:19.321
Boss, it's detective Arnold.

01:04:19.323 --> 01:04:20.455
I need to talk to you.

01:04:23.126 --> 01:04:24.426
Chief?

01:04:24.428 --> 01:04:25.861
Hello?

01:04:31.969 --> 01:04:34.035
Hello?

01:04:35.606 --> 01:04:38.139
Breaking and entering mean much
to you, detective?

01:04:38.141 --> 01:04:41.142
I heard some distress.

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:44.144
I-- It was uh, had justification
to uh, investigate.

01:04:44.147 --> 01:04:47.382
Maybe I have justification
to fire your ass.

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:48.750
What are you wearing?

01:04:48.751 --> 01:04:50.117
Chief, I need to talk to you.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.953
Is this about Jason Mewes,
again?

01:04:51.955 --> 01:04:54.005
Snoogans boy?

01:04:54.006 --> 01:04:56.056
- He's a cool guy.
- Shut the fuck up, lover boy.

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:58.560
You're not that beautiful,
you know that?

01:04:58.562 --> 01:04:59.561
Baby!

01:05:04.935 --> 01:05:06.468
Look into my eyes, detective.

01:05:07.971 --> 01:05:09.604
It'll be
like transporting yourself

01:05:09.606 --> 01:05:14.409
to an everlasting desert
of the purest beauty.

01:05:16.914 --> 01:05:19.648
So you really think
that Jason Mewes plotted

01:05:19.650 --> 01:05:23.051
and carried out a murder
under the noses of the LAPD?

01:05:23.053 --> 01:05:24.553
Jason Mewes was--

01:05:24.554 --> 01:05:26.054
Vinnie Jones killed
that casting director

01:05:26.056 --> 01:05:27.589
and ordered
the witness murdered.

01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:29.391
- That's it.
- Bullshit!

01:05:29.392 --> 01:05:31.192
Open and shut.
You're obsessed, detective.

01:05:31.194 --> 01:05:33.128
Leave Mewes the fuck alone
or I will prosecute you

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:34.696
for breaking and entering.

01:05:34.698 --> 01:05:37.265
Chief, you're not seeing
the trees for the wood.

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:40.101
And what are you doing
with those eyes

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:42.203
and using them as a--
some sort of weapon?

01:05:42.205 --> 01:05:44.139
Stop doing that
with your fucking eyes, man!

01:05:44.141 --> 01:05:45.140
Oh, it's I'm numb.

01:05:45.142 --> 01:05:46.574
I feel very strange.

01:05:46.576 --> 01:05:48.543
I'm comfortable
with my sexuality

01:05:48.545 --> 01:05:50.045
until this very second.

01:05:50.047 --> 01:05:51.146
I-- I love you.

01:05:51.148 --> 01:05:52.280
Oh.
How dare you.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:54.082
Fuck you!

01:05:54.084 --> 01:05:56.084
You beautiful son of a bitch!

01:05:56.086 --> 01:05:57.585
Fuck you.

01:05:57.587 --> 01:05:59.104
Fuck this.

01:06:03.593 --> 01:06:06.027
Fuck!
I'll kill that son of a bitch.

01:06:10.701 --> 01:06:13.735
Oh, fuck you.

01:06:13.737 --> 01:06:15.670
Oh, pick up, you cunt.

01:06:15.671 --> 01:06:17.604
Judge Marsh, it's been a while.

01:06:17.607 --> 01:06:19.708
I'm afraid not so good, sir.

01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:22.110
Yeah, I'm gonna need
to call in that Mexico favor.

01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:25.180
The system's failed me
and justice needs to be served.

01:06:30.287 --> 01:06:32.687
I've already told you
I didn't send any gangsters

01:06:32.689 --> 01:06:33.989
to kill that geezer.

01:06:33.991 --> 01:06:35.690
I don't even know any gangsters.

01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:37.359
Did I ever tell you
I was English?

01:06:37.361 --> 01:06:38.810
What?

01:06:38.811 --> 01:06:40.260
Yeah, actually I was born
in England.

01:06:40.263 --> 01:06:42.030
My grandma was from Essex.

01:06:42.032 --> 01:06:44.065
I pledge my allegiance
to the Queen.

01:06:44.067 --> 01:06:45.767
It's a known fact
that I might even be related

01:06:45.769 --> 01:06:49.070
to the bloodline
of Sherlock Holmes himself.

01:06:49.072 --> 01:06:50.638
The fictional character?

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.674
Did you know that Mewes
saw Anthony Costalino

01:06:52.676 --> 01:06:55.410
on the day that he was murdered?

01:06:55.412 --> 01:06:57.312
He fucking what?

01:06:57.314 --> 01:06:59.647
He was in a casting
which didn't go too well.

01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:03.218
I don't know, I mean um,
call me crazy,

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:05.253
but that's sort of
a big coincidence

01:07:05.254 --> 01:07:07.287
and I thought he failed
to mention to any of us.

01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:11.159
Don't you?

01:07:11.161 --> 01:07:13.779
Yeah.

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:16.398
Are you ready for some good news
finally, Mr. Jones?

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.432
Go on.

01:07:17.434 --> 01:07:19.301
I've talked to the powers

01:07:19.302 --> 01:07:21.169
that be a judge that
I'm quite good friends with.

01:07:21.171 --> 01:07:22.704
We had a weekend in Cabo once,

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:25.006
but that's neither here
nor there.

01:07:25.007 --> 01:07:27.307
He's decided that we don't have
enough evidence to keep you here

01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:29.310
and we're gonna let you out
on bail.

01:07:29.312 --> 01:07:31.346
Behave yourself now and--

01:07:31.348 --> 01:07:33.048
Adhere to those bail conditions.

01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:34.215
How do they say it in England?

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:36.084

01:10:42.706 --> 01:10:44.005

01:10:54.484 --> 01:10:57.252

Mr. Jones failed to return
to the halfway house last night,

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.793
a strict condition
of his controversial bail.

01:12:45.795 --> 01:12:47.829
Early theories coming out
of the LAPD

01:12:47.831 --> 01:12:50.498
are that Mr. Jones used
his British gangland connections

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.600
to smuggle him out
of the country.

01:12:52.602 --> 01:12:54.736
Attention now turns
to the lead detective

01:12:54.738 --> 01:12:56.904
in the case
as it was Detective Arnold

01:12:56.906 --> 01:12:58.940
who supported Jones's bail.

01:12:58.942 --> 01:13:03.444
#Bail, #fail, #bailfail.

01:13:03.446 --> 01:13:04.946
Wonder what took him so long.

01:13:04.948 --> 01:13:06.748
Are you expecting someone?

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:09.951
Don't worry about it.

01:13:14.657 --> 01:13:18.092
Hmm.

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:20.928
Little early
to be drinking there, officer.

01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:22.964
It's detective.

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:24.999
First step to recovery
is admitting you have a problem.

01:13:25.001 --> 01:13:26.834
I know you did it, motherfucker.

01:13:26.836 --> 01:13:28.703
You're lucky
you're hiding behind that badge

01:13:28.705 --> 01:13:32.874
or I might have
to bitch slap you, officer.

01:13:33.943 --> 01:13:35.276
Think you're tough, huh?

01:13:35.277 --> 01:13:36.610
Not so tough--

01:13:36.611 --> 01:13:37.944
Now are you, motherfucker?

01:13:37.945 --> 01:13:39.278
You don't think I'll do it.

01:13:39.279 --> 01:13:40.612
You don't think
I'll pull the fucking trigger.

01:13:40.617 --> 01:13:41.883
I'm twice the actor
you'll ever be.

01:13:41.885 --> 01:13:43.284
I'm English.

01:13:43.285 --> 01:13:44.684
I invented fucking acting,
you know.

01:13:44.687 --> 01:13:46.404
I should have
your goddamn career

01:13:46.405 --> 01:13:48.122
and you should be in jail
getting your asshole licked

01:13:48.124 --> 01:13:50.925
by a fat man in a jumpsuit.

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:54.162
It's not the last you've heard
of me, Mewes.

01:13:54.164 --> 01:13:55.863
Fucker!

01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:00.601
Son of a bitch.

01:14:09.979 --> 01:14:11.145
What the hell was that?

01:14:11.147 --> 01:14:13.047
Some guy selling insurance.

01:14:13.049 --> 01:14:14.649
I heard yelling.

01:14:14.651 --> 01:14:16.851
Uh, it's just insurances.

01:14:16.853 --> 01:14:18.052
Right.

01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:22.089
The LAPD have
launched an official manhunt

01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:25.860
for British soccer star
turned movie star Vinnie Jones.

01:14:25.862 --> 01:14:27.362
He is wanted on suspicion

01:14:27.363 --> 01:14:28.863
of the murder
of Anthony Costalino

01:14:28.865 --> 01:14:30.865
and for ordering gang members
to put a hit

01:14:30.867 --> 01:14:34.035
on the only known-witness
to the Costalino murder.

01:14:34.037 --> 01:14:35.870
Police have found no trace
of Jones

01:14:35.872 --> 01:14:38.873
but they have found
his rental car abandoned.

01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:44.612
Jason, who loves you, baby?

01:14:44.614 --> 01:14:45.813
Yo, what's up, Geena?

01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:47.114
Geena nailed it.

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:49.016
Autograph shows,
some geeky bullshit,

01:14:49.018 --> 01:14:50.017
event's sold out.

01:14:52.789 --> 01:14:54.755
Tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

01:14:54.757 --> 01:14:56.958
They'll give you your cut,
cash in hand.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.359
Boom.
Ooh!

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.759
- Sorry, I can't make it.
- What?

01:14:59.762 --> 01:15:00.895
But-- but you said--

01:15:00.897 --> 01:15:02.814
Forget what I said, alright?

01:15:02.815 --> 01:15:04.732
And get me a studio casting
already.

01:15:04.734 --> 01:15:05.733
<i>Jason</i>!

01:15:07.904 --> 01:15:10.671
I have gotta
fuck this guy's brains out.

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:13.207
He is untameable.

01:15:19.215 --> 01:15:20.781
Psst!

01:15:21.951 --> 01:15:23.885
You always dress like that, bro?

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:32.059
A word to the wise

01:15:32.061 --> 01:15:34.829
about your friend
Brian O'Halloran.

01:15:34.831 --> 01:15:37.298
Seems he's not as good a friend
as you thought he was.

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:39.233
Wait,
you know about Carrie and Brian?

01:15:39.235 --> 01:15:40.768
- What?
- You just said--

01:15:40.770 --> 01:15:42.303
- I know but Carrie?
- Exactly!

01:15:42.305 --> 01:15:44.038
- No!
- Huh?

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.806
Brian tried to fuck you.

01:15:45.808 --> 01:15:47.058
Carrie?

01:15:47.059 --> 01:15:48.309
- Brian fucked Carrie?
- Brian fucked me?

01:15:48.311 --> 01:15:49.544
No!

01:15:49.546 --> 01:15:50.745
Wait, what?

01:15:50.747 --> 01:15:52.764
How did Brian fuck me?

01:15:52.765 --> 01:15:54.782
I have it on very good authority
that the studio saw

01:15:54.784 --> 01:15:56.784
early footage
of <i> Acupuncture Killer</i>

01:15:56.785 --> 01:15:58.785
and they love you
for the <i> Odyssey</i> lead,

01:15:58.788 --> 01:16:01.923
especially hand-in-hand
with Brian's own story,

01:16:01.925 --> 01:16:04.825
some publicity-perfect storm
kind of deal.

01:16:04.827 --> 01:16:07.044
This can't be true.

01:16:07.045 --> 01:16:09.262
Brian didn't think
that you could handle the role.

01:16:09.265 --> 01:16:11.098
He went out of his way
to make sure

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:13.167
you did not get the offer.

01:16:13.169 --> 01:16:14.602
Dude, I gotta go.

01:16:43.633 --> 01:16:44.732
♪ Hit it ♪

01:16:47.337 --> 01:16:48.869
♪ I got ♪

01:16:54.143 --> 01:16:56.077
I never
understood how an actress

01:16:56.079 --> 01:16:59.046
can be expected
to show vulnerabilities,

01:16:59.048 --> 01:17:03.217
show her true self,
really reveal herself

01:17:03.219 --> 01:17:04.619
if she doesn't trust--

01:17:05.622 --> 01:17:06.954
Oh, Brian!

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:08.255
Oh my goodness, bro.

01:17:08.257 --> 01:17:09.957
Jay, hey, man.

01:17:09.958 --> 01:17:11.658
Dude,
I can't believe I ran into you.

01:17:11.659 --> 01:17:13.359
I was walking around outside
and it's whoa!

01:17:13.363 --> 01:17:14.629
Isn't that your car, Jay?

01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:15.663
No, it's not my car.

01:17:18.301 --> 01:17:20.935
Dude, it's got your name
on the license plate.

01:17:20.937 --> 01:17:23.371
<i>The Odyssey</i>.

01:17:23.373 --> 01:17:24.672
Oh, yeah.

01:17:24.674 --> 01:17:26.140
Um, Jay, about that--

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:27.375
Brian got me the role,
I knew it.

01:17:27.377 --> 01:17:30.044
Actually,
I called the studio, Jay,

01:17:30.046 --> 01:17:32.246
and I fought for you,
I really did, man,

01:17:32.248 --> 01:17:34.682
but they're going
in a different direction.

01:17:34.684 --> 01:17:37.952
The Brian I know would say,
"Mewes gets the lead part."

01:17:37.954 --> 01:17:39.320
Jay, I did everything I could.

01:17:39.322 --> 01:17:41.322
It's fucking bullshit, bro.

01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:43.424
Oh, we should get going.

01:17:43.426 --> 01:17:45.660
Let me give you
a little piece of advice, Jason.

01:17:45.662 --> 01:17:46.911
Did you ever hear
of a hockey player

01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:48.161
by the name of Sam Lennox?

01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:50.698
Fucking don't do this,
please, bro!

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:52.667
Jay, you alright?

01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:54.969
Do you need to like call someone
or talk it out or--

01:17:54.971 --> 01:17:56.487
Or maybe I should--

01:17:56.488 --> 01:17:58.004
Or maybe you should stand up
for your fucking friend, man,

01:17:58.007 --> 01:17:59.206
please.

01:17:59.208 --> 01:18:00.708
I'll see around.

01:18:24.767 --> 01:18:26.200
Dude, did you know?

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:27.652
What?

01:18:27.653 --> 01:18:29.103
That Brian didn't want me
in <i> The Odyssey</i>!

01:18:29.105 --> 01:18:30.104
Who told you this?

01:18:30.106 --> 01:18:31.606
Don't lie to me!

01:18:31.607 --> 01:18:33.107
I'm not fucking lying,
I'm just asking.

01:18:33.109 --> 01:18:35.109
And you know what?

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:37.110
Lately, you're really out
of fucking pocket, man,

01:18:37.111 --> 01:18:39.111
forgetting the relationship
and shit like that.

01:18:39.115 --> 01:18:41.148
Oh, that's fucked up,
you didn't tell me, alright?

01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:42.850
Brian stabbing me in the back
is one thing, but you?

01:18:42.852 --> 01:18:44.802
Come on!

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:46.753
I didn't fucking stab you
in the back, motherfucker.

01:18:46.756 --> 01:18:48.255
Like did it ever occur to you

01:18:48.257 --> 01:18:50.391
maybe I was looking out
for your best interests?

01:18:50.393 --> 01:18:52.460
Oh, how exactly?

01:18:52.462 --> 01:18:53.394
Fine.
You know what?

01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:54.762
Fuck.

01:18:54.764 --> 01:18:56.197
I love you to death, okay?

01:18:56.199 --> 01:18:58.299
You're like my best friend
in the world,

01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.400
but like you are
not a leading man.

01:19:00.403 --> 01:19:02.086
And Brian's gonna make a movie

01:19:02.087 --> 01:19:03.770
the whole fucking world's
gonna see.

01:19:03.773 --> 01:19:06.841
And if you fail on that stage,
man, that's huge.

01:19:06.843 --> 01:19:08.476
And it's tough
to get out from under that

01:19:08.478 --> 01:19:10.445
and it fucking hurts.

01:19:10.446 --> 01:19:12.413
When you carry a flop,
you turn to fucking shit.

01:19:12.415 --> 01:19:13.514
I-- I became a stoner.

01:19:13.516 --> 01:19:15.071
Do you ever wonder why?

01:19:15.072 --> 01:19:16.627
<i>Zack and Miri Make a Porno.</i>

01:19:16.628 --> 01:19:18.183
You start turning to substances,
okay?

01:19:18.187 --> 01:19:20.098
That's me saying it.

01:19:20.099 --> 01:19:22.010
People are still
fucking making fun of <i> Tusk</i>,

01:19:22.011 --> 01:19:23.922
and fucking <i> Mallrats</i>,
and shit like that.

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:25.860
And my big fucking fear is
the movie flops

01:19:25.862 --> 01:19:27.362
and you're sitting around

01:19:27.363 --> 01:19:28.863
wanting
to fucking dampen the pain,

01:19:28.865 --> 01:19:30.197
then maybe you fucking...

01:19:30.199 --> 01:19:31.465
Come on, you can say it, bro.

01:19:33.101 --> 01:19:34.734
We don't really wanna do this,
dude.

01:19:34.735 --> 01:19:36.368
Like let's just--
let me enjoy my joint.

01:19:36.372 --> 01:19:38.906
Just say it, bro,
come on, fucking say it!

01:19:38.908 --> 01:19:41.308
Maybe you start fucking
using again, alright?

01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:43.177
Maybe you fucking wind up
with a goddamn 12-gauge

01:19:43.179 --> 01:19:45.046
in your arm.

01:19:45.047 --> 01:19:46.914
Maybe I gotta fucking take you
to nine more fucking rehabs,

01:19:46.916 --> 01:19:48.883
watch you run out
of another one,

01:19:48.884 --> 01:19:50.851
and fucking I gotta
be your goddamn human parachute,

01:19:50.853 --> 01:19:52.820
save you
from the fucking rock bottom

01:19:52.822 --> 01:19:54.555
that you're always trying
to drag

01:19:54.556 --> 01:19:56.289
both of us fucking down to, man.

01:19:56.292 --> 01:19:57.792
I'm sorry, not for nothing,

01:19:57.793 --> 01:19:59.293
but I go through
that shit again, dude.

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:00.828
I got a kid of my own!

01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:02.229
You're fucking great
in my movies.

01:20:02.231 --> 01:20:04.048
Don't get me wrong.

01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:05.866
You're born to play Jay,
but fuck, dude,

01:20:05.868 --> 01:20:09.036
that's a big fucking job
and you're not that actor.

01:20:09.038 --> 01:20:11.338
So stop fucking hounding people
about it.

01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:15.810
Or maybe it doesn't flop,
and it fucking skyrockets,

01:20:15.812 --> 01:20:18.012
and I'm born
to play the fucking <i> Odyssey</i>.

01:20:18.014 --> 01:20:21.348
I nail it,
my career surpasses yours,

01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:23.384
and I'm not
in your fucking pocket

01:20:23.386 --> 01:20:25.486
- to pull out when you want.
- Yeah.

01:20:25.488 --> 01:20:27.471
And then you put me
in your movie

01:20:27.472 --> 01:20:29.455
and my shit kills it,
and for the first time ever

01:20:29.458 --> 01:20:31.358
in the history
of Kevin Smith movies,

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:34.428
the movie makes money!

01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:36.597
How about that shit?

01:20:36.599 --> 01:20:39.900
Okay, I'm-- like this is
so not the fucking time

01:20:39.902 --> 01:20:40.935
to even do this.

01:20:40.937 --> 01:20:42.970
Like...

01:20:42.972 --> 01:20:45.306
I don't know if you noticed,

01:20:45.308 --> 01:20:49.109
but I'm about to go
to a fucking comedy show!

01:20:49.111 --> 01:20:51.695
So you know what, dude,

01:20:51.696 --> 01:20:54.280
if that's really the way
you feel about shit,

01:20:54.283 --> 01:20:55.282
Like fuck off.

01:20:55.284 --> 01:20:57.151
Go fuck yourself.

01:20:57.152 --> 01:20:59.019
You know what?
Go step on that.

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.887
Silent Bob wants Jay to go step
on that fucking joint.

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:32.920
Ferny, man.

01:21:32.922 --> 01:21:35.556
I gotta fire
that security idiot.

01:21:35.558 --> 01:21:37.558
Kevin and O'Halloran
are fucking working together,

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.493
- dude, to destroy me.
- What?

01:21:39.495 --> 01:21:40.995
Dude, they're trying
to sabotage my career.

01:21:40.997 --> 01:21:42.096
Jason, relax, man.

01:21:42.098 --> 01:21:43.564
What's going on?

01:21:43.566 --> 01:21:45.065
I messed up, dude.

01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:47.568
I read the whole book.

01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:49.570
Oh, shit!

01:21:49.572 --> 01:21:51.538
I followed it step-by-step

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:53.173
and it cleared my thoughts,
dude,

01:21:53.175 --> 01:21:54.942
and at first I thought
I could handle it,

01:21:54.944 --> 01:21:57.111
but then with Kevin and--
and then I-- I feel

01:21:57.113 --> 01:21:58.479
like I'm losing my fucking mind,
man.

01:21:58.481 --> 01:21:59.480
Breathe, Jason.

01:21:59.482 --> 01:22:00.915
I'm going crazy.

01:22:00.917 --> 01:22:03.183
No, you are evolving.

01:22:03.185 --> 01:22:05.619
You're seeing the world
from a different plane!

01:22:05.621 --> 01:22:08.589
The book does that to you, man.

01:22:08.591 --> 01:22:10.224
I've been there.

01:22:10.226 --> 01:22:11.558
What-- what do you mean?

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:14.011
Jason, I, too, was an actor,

01:22:14.012 --> 01:22:16.463
hugely popular
in my home country.

01:22:16.465 --> 01:22:20.000
But I was cursed.

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:23.536
Everybody I meet falls
hopelessly in love with me.

01:22:23.539 --> 01:22:26.974
And believe me, Jason,
it is a curse.

01:22:26.976 --> 01:22:29.076
So just like you,
I decided to change,

01:22:29.078 --> 01:22:31.128
beat the curse.

01:22:31.129 --> 01:22:33.179
So I came to America to act,
to play the bad guy,

01:22:33.182 --> 01:22:34.982
the gangster and--

01:22:34.984 --> 01:22:37.718
and one day I met
with a director late at night,

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:41.989
and he of course, was hopelessly
in love with me,

01:22:41.991 --> 01:22:43.958
and I had a plan.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.059
Okay.

01:23:09.552 --> 01:23:11.685
How do you think
I met the chief?

01:23:11.687 --> 01:23:14.054
She arrested you?

01:23:14.056 --> 01:23:17.091
For the first time in my life
I was in love,

01:23:17.093 --> 01:23:19.093
deeply in love.

01:23:19.095 --> 01:23:23.397
She massaged the charges
and made them disappear.

01:23:23.399 --> 01:23:27.134
For her, I quit acting
and went into hiding

01:23:27.136 --> 01:23:28.669
from all who loved me.

01:23:28.671 --> 01:23:30.571
And I don't regret it
for one second,

01:23:30.573 --> 01:23:33.007
because it was time
to give up the book,

01:23:33.009 --> 01:23:35.309
but only to the right person.

01:23:35.311 --> 01:23:37.011
Uh, I can't think straight.

01:23:37.013 --> 01:23:38.212
Right, well, Kevin,
he betrayed me,

01:23:38.214 --> 01:23:39.313
he broke my heart, dude.

01:23:39.315 --> 01:23:41.048
And then O'Halloran and Carrie--

01:23:41.050 --> 01:23:42.783
Jason,
as long as there is Silent Bob,

01:23:42.785 --> 01:23:45.219
there will always be Jay.

01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:50.024
Anything and anyone in the way
of turning Jay into Jason

01:23:50.026 --> 01:23:52.527
must be dealt with.

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:55.029
This is why I chose
to give you the book.

01:23:55.031 --> 01:23:57.431
You are right.

01:23:57.433 --> 01:23:58.699
Thanks, man.

01:23:58.701 --> 01:24:01.301
Oh, and, Jason!

01:24:01.303 --> 01:24:03.437
I have a feeling
this might come in useful.

01:24:06.442 --> 01:24:10.044
You're a dangerous man,
Fernando.

01:25:27.323 --> 01:25:29.256
There you are.

01:25:29.257 --> 01:25:31.190
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

01:25:31.193 --> 01:25:32.526
Not even supposed
to be here today.

01:25:32.528 --> 01:25:34.294
That's right, motherfucker.

01:25:34.296 --> 01:25:35.529
Carried that movie.

01:25:46.809 --> 01:25:48.308
Oh, I gotta see this again.

01:25:51.614 --> 01:25:53.547
I'm not
even supposed to be here today.

01:25:55.417 --> 01:25:57.417
Every fucking time,
it kills me, man.

01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:15.569
You want what?

01:26:15.571 --> 01:26:16.603
A blowie.

01:26:16.605 --> 01:26:18.338
Not a big deal.

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:19.907
It won't last long.

01:26:19.908 --> 01:26:21.475
You can forget about it,
you little shit.

01:26:21.477 --> 01:26:23.310
Oh, you've already showed me
your titties.

01:26:23.312 --> 01:26:26.247
For my fiancé.

01:26:26.248 --> 01:26:29.183
He wants that comic book so bad
he'd probably blow you himself.

01:26:29.185 --> 01:26:32.486
Also, it's not the full titty
unless you see the nip.

01:26:34.657 --> 01:26:36.723
I'm not
even supposed to be here today.

01:26:39.595 --> 01:26:42.196
Oh, man.

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.767
What the fuck?

01:26:53.742 --> 01:26:55.609
What is going on?

01:26:57.479 --> 01:26:59.213
It's not raining.

01:27:05.354 --> 01:27:07.454
Fucking sake.

01:27:07.456 --> 01:27:09.423
Stupid mirror.

01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:17.264
Jesus!

01:27:17.266 --> 01:27:18.632
Jesus?

01:27:18.634 --> 01:27:20.000
Who let you in?

01:27:20.002 --> 01:27:21.368
Come on.

01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:22.302
Come on, Jesus.
Look out.

01:27:22.304 --> 01:27:23.537
Good boy.

01:27:28.244 --> 01:27:29.710
Fuck is going on?

01:27:50.866 --> 01:27:52.599
Got you, mother--

01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:54.501
Jay?

01:27:54.503 --> 01:27:55.769
What are you doing here?

01:27:58.774 --> 01:28:00.507
What the fuck, Jay?

01:28:00.509 --> 01:28:01.875
Ow!

01:28:01.877 --> 01:28:03.577
Oh, man, you son of a--

01:28:10.519 --> 01:28:11.969
Okay, okay.

01:28:11.970 --> 01:28:13.420
Show me the full titty
and we have a deal.

01:28:13.422 --> 01:28:14.855
Go back inside and jerk off.

01:28:19.361 --> 01:28:20.694
Oh God!

01:28:20.696 --> 01:28:21.728
Yeah.

01:28:28.604 --> 01:28:30.437
Oh!

01:28:30.439 --> 01:28:32.939
You like
the fucking Golden Rocket?

01:28:46.655 --> 01:28:50.590
Jay, you can have <i> The Odyssey</i>.

01:28:50.592 --> 01:28:52.542
Carrie.

01:28:52.543 --> 01:28:54.493
I know about you and Carrie,
motherfucker!

01:28:55.798 --> 01:28:57.731
What about Carrie?

01:28:57.733 --> 01:28:58.732
Carrie?

01:28:58.734 --> 01:29:00.434
Jason!

01:29:00.436 --> 01:29:02.503
Who the hell is that?

01:29:02.504 --> 01:29:04.571
Are you about
to murder Brian O'Halloran?

01:29:04.573 --> 01:29:06.373
Look, I saw what was
on the computer, right?

01:29:06.375 --> 01:29:08.542
And I saw you guys hugging
at Esteban's.

01:29:08.544 --> 01:29:09.576
No.

01:29:09.578 --> 01:29:11.011
Jason, you asshole.

01:29:11.013 --> 01:29:12.579
I asked Brian
to take you seriously

01:29:12.581 --> 01:29:14.915
- as an actor at Esteban's.
- Yeah.

01:29:14.917 --> 01:29:16.909
I told him it would
mean the world for you

01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:18.902
if you got the role
in <i> The Odyssey</i>.

01:29:18.903 --> 01:29:20.895
Uh, yeah, man, yeah,
<i>The Odyssey</i>.

01:29:20.896 --> 01:29:22.888
This is also Brian
from next door.

01:29:22.891 --> 01:29:24.825
I've been bidding
on that fucking comic

01:29:24.827 --> 01:29:26.693
as a surprise to you.

01:29:26.695 --> 01:29:28.462
I've been bidding on that
as well.

01:29:28.464 --> 01:29:31.565
You are the other bidder?

01:29:31.567 --> 01:29:35.035
And you're
that rude little motherfucker.

01:29:35.037 --> 01:29:38.672
Sit the fuck down!

01:29:38.674 --> 01:29:41.875
You were about to kill Brian
for me?

01:29:41.877 --> 01:29:44.511
Not exactly, but...

01:29:44.513 --> 01:29:46.513
Well, yeah, I guess I was.

01:29:53.555 --> 01:29:54.788
Baby.

01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:57.057
Carrie.

01:29:57.059 --> 01:29:58.525
I love you.

01:29:58.527 --> 01:30:00.560
I love you, too.

01:30:06.535 --> 01:30:09.803
What are we gonna do
about O'Halloran?

01:30:09.805 --> 01:30:11.671
Baby, he's a witness now.

01:30:11.673 --> 01:30:12.806
The Odyssey's,
you're right about it.

01:30:12.808 --> 01:30:13.874
I'm not a witness.

01:30:13.876 --> 01:30:15.976
I'm not saying anything.

01:30:15.977 --> 01:30:18.077
Well, I guess you better finish
the job then, angel.

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:19.079
You sure?

01:30:19.081 --> 01:30:21.081
No, please.

01:30:21.083 --> 01:30:22.716
What's the alternative?

01:30:22.718 --> 01:30:23.950
What?

01:30:23.952 --> 01:30:26.553
I guess you're right.

01:30:26.555 --> 01:30:28.822
Jason, wait.

01:30:28.824 --> 01:30:30.657
What is it?

01:30:30.659 --> 01:30:31.992
Say it for me.

01:30:31.994 --> 01:30:33.660
Please.

01:30:33.662 --> 01:30:34.828
Oh yeah.

01:30:34.830 --> 01:30:36.696
Snoogans, motherfucker!

01:30:43.005 --> 01:30:46.139
You have been found guilty
of murder in the first degree.

01:30:49.011 --> 01:30:50.833
Silence in court!

01:30:50.834 --> 01:30:52.656
...also starring in such movies
as <i> Clerks</i>,

01:30:52.657 --> 01:30:54.479
<i>Chasing Amy,</i> and <i> Mallrats</i>
has been called back

01:30:54.483 --> 01:30:57.751
into the court as the jury
has reached a verdict.

01:30:57.753 --> 01:31:02.856
A celebrity capable
of setting an example.

01:31:02.858 --> 01:31:05.158
Instead you chose to act

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:08.061
in a consistently
despicable manner,

01:31:08.063 --> 01:31:11.131
be it on the screen
or over a podcast.

01:31:11.133 --> 01:31:13.200
The crux of the case came
when DNA evidence

01:31:13.202 --> 01:31:15.001
was found at the scene
of the crime.

01:31:15.003 --> 01:31:17.204
Therefore, this court
is left with no choice

01:31:17.206 --> 01:31:22.042
but to impose a sentence
of life imprisonment.

01:31:22.044 --> 01:31:26.246
Do you have anything to say
to the court at this time?

01:31:26.248 --> 01:31:28.748
Mr. Smith?

01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:32.085
I c-- I can't-- I can't believe
this is happening.

01:31:32.087 --> 01:31:33.887
It wasn't me, man!

01:31:33.889 --> 01:31:35.755
- I'm innocent.
- That'll do.

01:31:35.757 --> 01:31:37.991
It wasn't the fat one,
it was the skinny one!

01:31:37.993 --> 01:31:40.760
- Silence!
- Man!

01:31:40.762 --> 01:31:42.162
The remnants
of a marijuana cigarette

01:31:42.164 --> 01:31:44.498
with traces of Kevin Smith's DNA
was found

01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:46.867
on the body of Brian O'Halloran.

01:31:46.869 --> 01:31:48.101
Silent Bob wants Jay
to go step

01:31:48.103 --> 01:31:49.503
on that fucking joint.

01:31:55.043 --> 01:31:58.211
Some suggest that this murder
is the result of reefer madness.

01:31:58.213 --> 01:32:00.780
As Kevin Smith was a loud
proponent of marijuana smoking,

01:32:00.782 --> 01:32:02.916
it brings into question--

01:32:02.918 --> 01:32:04.918
Wait.
Wait, wait!

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:07.787
Wait, I'm getting breaking news.

01:32:07.789 --> 01:32:09.189
Kevin Smith
has been found guilty

01:32:09.191 --> 01:32:10.991
of the murder
of Brian O'Halloran.

01:32:10.993 --> 01:32:12.009
Kevin! Kevin!

01:32:12.010 --> 01:32:13.026
Here he is.
Kevin.

01:32:13.028 --> 01:32:14.344
Move, bitch!

01:32:14.345 --> 01:32:15.661
- Kevin!
- Kevin Smith.

01:32:15.662 --> 01:32:16.978
- Out of my way, bitch!
- It wasn't me.

01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:19.917
Kevin! Kevin!

01:32:19.918 --> 01:32:21.535
Come on, man, it wasn't me,
it was the other guy!

01:32:21.537 --> 01:32:22.536
Come on!

01:32:22.538 --> 01:32:24.037
It was Jay!

01:32:24.039 --> 01:32:25.956
Jay!

01:32:25.957 --> 01:32:27.874
I'd like to thank the detectives
who worked so hard on this case

01:32:27.876 --> 01:32:30.076
to bring us a swift
and just verdict.

01:32:30.078 --> 01:32:31.734
What's the latest
with Vinnie Jones?

01:32:31.735 --> 01:32:33.391
Does he link to this case?

01:32:33.392 --> 01:32:35.048
The LAPD has
an outstanding arrest warrant

01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:37.217
for Vincent Jones
regarding two separate murders.

01:32:37.219 --> 01:32:39.853
However, latest intelligence
suggests he's currently hiding

01:32:39.855 --> 01:32:42.789
in the United Kingdom amidst
his extensive criminal network

01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:44.224
within the British underworld.

01:32:44.225 --> 01:32:45.658
- Jay!
- It's Jason!

01:32:45.659 --> 01:32:47.092
Jason!
Move, bitch.

01:32:47.095 --> 01:32:49.796
Jason, how do you feel
about the court's decision?

01:32:49.798 --> 01:32:51.565
Absolutely mortified.

01:32:51.567 --> 01:32:53.567
Do you still believe Kevin
was innocent?

01:32:53.569 --> 01:32:56.069
Now, I believe you know,
Kevin's jealousy

01:32:56.071 --> 01:32:58.238
over Brian O'Halloran's
career directing,

01:32:58.240 --> 01:32:59.973
it's a little funky,

01:32:59.975 --> 01:33:03.076
but I can't imagine Kevin
doing anything like this.

01:33:03.078 --> 01:33:04.177
Oh, Jason.

01:33:04.179 --> 01:33:05.946
Jason, is it also true

01:33:05.948 --> 01:33:07.347
that you've been hired
onto what would have been

01:33:07.349 --> 01:33:09.983
Mr. O'Halloran's
big directorial debut?

01:33:09.985 --> 01:33:11.935
Well, Brian and I spoke
at lengths

01:33:11.936 --> 01:33:13.886
about me playing the lead
in <i> The Odyssey</i>,

01:33:13.889 --> 01:33:15.889
and matter of fact
the first time

01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:17.890
he showed me the project,
it was on the set of <i> Dogma</i>.

01:33:17.893 --> 01:33:19.259
So I think I should
follow through with it

01:33:19.261 --> 01:33:21.661
and who better than Chris Nolan

01:33:21.663 --> 01:33:23.597
to fill
Brian's remarkable shoes.

01:33:23.599 --> 01:33:25.031
I mean it's gonna be great.
Great.

01:33:25.033 --> 01:33:26.333
Oh, Jason, one last question.

01:33:26.335 --> 01:33:28.201
Jason!
Jason!

01:33:45.153 --> 01:33:46.653
Mr. Arnold!

01:33:46.655 --> 01:33:48.622
- Mr. Arnold!
- Detective.

01:33:48.624 --> 01:33:50.274
Do you not believe
your presence here

01:33:50.275 --> 01:33:51.925
is a little inappropriate
considering what you--

01:33:51.927 --> 01:33:54.294
Jason Mewes
is a criminal mastermind.

01:33:54.296 --> 01:33:56.146
Your obsession with Mewes
is alleged

01:33:56.147 --> 01:33:57.997
to have dated back
to your unsuccessful audition

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.033
for a role that Jason
was offered.

01:34:00.035 --> 01:34:01.568
Noogles to the snoo--

01:34:01.569 --> 01:34:03.102
- No, next.
- Oh.

01:34:03.103 --> 01:34:04.636
That's substantiated
and you can't prove that.

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:06.640
You have been disgraced,
thrown off the force,

01:34:06.642 --> 01:34:08.408
and could face
criminal assault charges

01:34:08.410 --> 01:34:11.044
after the infamous
security video was leaked.

01:34:13.148 --> 01:34:15.181
Now are you, motherfucker?

01:34:15.183 --> 01:34:17.417
And yet you stand here today
still insisting

01:34:17.419 --> 01:34:20.053
that Mewes is a murderer?

01:34:20.055 --> 01:34:22.222
If I have to spend
every goddamn second

01:34:22.223 --> 01:34:24.390
of the rest of my life proving
that Jason Mewes is a murderer,

01:34:24.393 --> 01:34:25.692
I will.

01:34:25.693 --> 01:34:26.992
I'm a descendant
of Sherlock Holmes,

01:34:26.995 --> 01:34:28.094
motherfucker.

01:34:28.096 --> 01:34:29.396
I can solve anything.

01:34:29.398 --> 01:34:31.064
You hear that, Mewes?

01:34:31.066 --> 01:34:32.966
I'm coming for you,
son of a bitch.

01:34:32.968 --> 01:34:35.101
You cock-sucking actor,
motherfucker.

01:34:35.103 --> 01:34:36.703
I'm coming for you!

01:34:36.705 --> 01:34:38.104
Nothing will stop me!

01:34:38.106 --> 01:34:40.240
Absolutely nothing!

01:34:40.242 --> 01:34:41.274
Fucker!

01:34:43.345 --> 01:34:44.934
If he's related
to Sherlock Holmes,

01:34:44.935 --> 01:34:46.524
then I am fucking Ryan Gosling.

01:34:46.525 --> 01:34:48.114
And let me tell you now,
I am not fucking Go--

01:35:16.712 --> 01:35:19.245
We have a brand new number
1 most important movie star

01:35:19.247 --> 01:35:20.380
in the world.

01:35:23.418 --> 01:35:25.852
That's right, Danny Trejo
is on top

01:35:25.854 --> 01:35:27.887
as the world's
most important movie star.

01:36:51.873 --> 01:36:53.684
Piece of shit!

01:36:53.685 --> 01:36:55.496
See for yourself.
Why don't you have a sip?

01:36:55.497 --> 01:36:57.308
- I will cut your throat, bitch.
- Why?

01:36:57.312 --> 01:36:59.212
You didn't see me run
anyone over.

01:36:59.214 --> 01:37:00.947
- I didn't see you.
- Wait, what?

01:37:00.949 --> 01:37:02.315
I thought maybe it was that

01:37:02.317 --> 01:37:04.350
English soccer thug
turned actor,

01:37:04.352 --> 01:37:05.668
'cause they keep showing him
on the news,

01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:06.985
but I was blinded
by the headlights,

01:37:06.988 --> 01:37:08.521
- I didn't see.
- Woah!

01:37:08.523 --> 01:37:10.456
Back here, dude.

01:37:10.458 --> 01:37:12.392
Dude, it's me.

01:37:12.394 --> 01:37:13.960
Who's me?

01:37:13.962 --> 01:37:15.395
It's Zach.

01:37:15.397 --> 01:37:16.963
What the fuck?

01:37:16.965 --> 01:37:18.298
- Zach Galligan?
- Shhh!

01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:19.850
Keep your voice down, man.

01:37:19.851 --> 01:37:21.401
I'm gonna be signing shit here
for a month.

01:37:21.403 --> 01:37:23.369
Zach, didn't you get a call?

01:37:23.371 --> 01:37:24.370
You know,
this kid came up to me...

01:37:24.372 --> 01:37:25.839
What?

01:37:25.841 --> 01:37:27.624
Get a call.
What?

01:37:27.625 --> 01:37:29.408
- That's not the line.
- I'm sorry, bro.

01:37:29.411 --> 01:37:31.978
Uh, we gave this part
to Dean Cain.

01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:34.013
What, you gave it to Cain?

01:37:34.015 --> 01:37:35.381
Super bitch?

01:37:35.383 --> 01:37:37.233
Dean Cain.

01:37:37.234 --> 01:37:39.084
He's not in <i> Gremlins</i>
or <i> Gremlins 2</i>.

01:37:39.087 --> 01:37:41.054
Zach, I gave you the part
as the director.

01:37:41.056 --> 01:37:42.388
But I can do two parts.

01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:43.990
That's why I did the accent.

01:37:43.992 --> 01:37:45.525
Bro, I don't know what to say.

01:37:45.527 --> 01:37:47.126
Why don't you go watch
your fucking movie?

01:37:47.128 --> 01:37:48.628
I need an ambulance.

01:37:48.630 --> 01:37:51.130
No shit,
'cause that looks painful.

01:37:51.132 --> 01:37:52.398
You killed that guy.

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:54.400
You're looking pretty pale, bro.

01:37:54.402 --> 01:37:57.337
Are you kidding me?

01:37:57.339 --> 01:37:59.138
What have you got for me
in the picture, huh?

01:37:59.140 --> 01:38:01.941
It's like it could be like
end-title sequence?

01:38:01.943 --> 01:38:03.676
Or it could be
like a crowd sequence

01:38:03.677 --> 01:38:05.410
and it would be like,
"Hey, hey, Gremlin dude!"

01:38:05.413 --> 01:38:06.446
You know,
if I act something like that.

01:38:06.448 --> 01:38:07.480
What do you say?

01:38:07.482 --> 01:38:08.982
We are fully casted.

01:38:10.018 --> 01:38:11.651
You gotta help me out.

01:38:11.653 --> 01:38:13.920
I need screen time.

01:38:13.922 --> 01:38:16.055
I'm trying to fucking stay
in the game.

01:38:16.057 --> 01:38:18.658
Alright, listen, I'll talk
to my producers Dom and Rob,

01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:19.893
see if we can--

01:38:19.895 --> 01:38:21.394
Don't pawn me off, bro.

01:38:21.396 --> 01:38:22.395
I'm not.

01:38:22.397 --> 01:38:23.897
Shut up!

01:38:26.434 --> 01:38:28.568
And cut.

01:38:28.570 --> 01:38:29.869
Thank you, everyone.

01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:31.169
That is a picture wrap.
