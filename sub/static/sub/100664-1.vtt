You can do it. You can do it.
You can-- Just kiss her.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.000
Just...

01:24.083 --> 01:25.500
She likes you, all right?

01:25.583 --> 01:27.250
Yeah, I think-- I think-- Yeah, she does.

01:27.333 --> 01:28.916
No, she doesn't. She does. She does.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.125
You've spent the whole weekend
putting off this moment,

01:31.208 --> 01:34.000
and now you're actually out of time.

01:35.791 --> 01:37.500
Literally, out of time.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.750
Right, this is it, this is it.
This is your moment. This is...

-[man, in Italian] How long does it take?

01:44.041 --> 01:45.000

01:47.666 --> 01:48.750
[exhales] Okay.

01:50.000 --> 01:50.833
Yeah.

01:52.041 --> 01:52.916
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:53.166 --> 01:55.750
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, just a bit of tummy trouble.

01:56.625 --> 01:59.875
-I was worried you might miss your flight.
-No, I've got a few minutes.

02:01.958 --> 02:04.000
Can you believe how lucky your sister got?

02:04.083 --> 02:07.458
She gets sent off to Rome for work,
and I get sent off to war-torn hellholes.

02:07.541 --> 02:09.541
Well, I suppose if you're gonna be
a war journalist,

02:09.625 --> 02:11.500
that might, more or less,
be what you'd expect.

02:11.583 --> 02:12.750
Okay, smartass.

02:13.333 --> 02:14.416
[chuckles]

02:16.416 --> 02:17.291
This has, uh...

02:19.375 --> 02:21.791
This has been a pretty special weekend.

02:23.958 --> 02:24.791
Yeah.

02:26.208 --> 02:28.416
I have to admit that when Hayley
told me her older brother

02:28.500 --> 02:31.958
was coming to visit the same weekend
that I was coming, I was pretty bummed,

02:32.041 --> 02:35.625
but it turns out you're not as irritating
as I thought you'd be.

02:35.916 --> 02:36.833
Wow.

02:36.916 --> 02:39.750
Uh, I think that's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

02:39.833 --> 02:42.333
Well, that's the nicest thing
I've ever said to anyone, so...

02:42.416 --> 02:45.333
-Well, then I'm doubly honored. Thank you.
-[laughs] You're welcome.

02:50.708 --> 02:51.958
an amazing time.

02:52.041 --> 02:54.458
I don't think I've met anyone
quite like you.

02:55.416 --> 02:56.791
You're just a charmer, huh?

02:56.875 --> 03:01.166
No, I promise you I'm not.
I'm a terrible, terrible charmer.

03:01.250 --> 03:02.125
[chuckles]

03:02.208 --> 03:03.875
Uh, I'm just being honest.

03:34.083 --> 03:34.916
Sorry.

-Hi. Dina.
-Nice to meet you.

03:36.375 --> 03:37.250
Nice to meet you, too.

03:37.333 --> 03:39.875
-We used to share a dorm at university.
-Oh. [chuckles]

03:39.958 --> 03:41.083
We used to call him Mr. Wank.

03:43.416 --> 03:44.666
Because he used to wank a lot.

03:45.375 --> 03:48.000
-I don't think that was me.
-No, that was definitely you!

03:48.291 --> 03:49.166
Anyway...

03:49.541 --> 03:51.333
I've actually got to get back to London.

03:51.416 --> 03:53.083
-I'm going to the airport.
-No way. Me too.

03:53.166 --> 03:55.291
-Shut up.
-I'm literally going right now.

03:55.375 --> 03:57.250
-Yeah, I've got a car. I could drive us.
-Really?

03:57.333 --> 03:58.333
[Greg] Yeah.

03:58.416 --> 03:59.583
[Jack] It's not a problem.

04:03.750 --> 04:05.458
Oh, so you're gonna go now?

04:10.208 --> 04:11.083
Yeah.

04:11.833 --> 04:12.916
I guess I am...

04:13.625 --> 04:14.625
going now.

04:16.041 --> 04:17.041
Oh, okay.

04:21.791 --> 04:23.666
Don't know when
we'll see each other again, so...

04:23.750 --> 04:25.041
Sure, yeah. Go ahead.

04:29.250 --> 04:30.083

-Oh, okay. Uh...

-Oh, nice to meet you, too.

-Yup.

-No, no, I actually can't.

08:42.625 --> 08:44.291
Um, couple of questions, though.

08:44.375 --> 08:47.250
Can we stop calling it "maid of honor"
and call it "man of honor" instead?

08:47.333 --> 08:48.583
No. Second question?

08:48.666 --> 08:50.458
Only because I'm a man, obviously, but...

Secondly,

08:52.000 --> 08:53.750
am I sitting next to Vitelli?

you haven't jumped at the chance.

with someone is a big deal.

gonna jump into.

That's...

10:40.625 --> 10:41.583
Here you go, mate.

10:41.666 --> 10:44.875
You know, I actually thought "penne"
was the Italian for "penis,"

10:44.958 --> 10:47.541
because of their kind of small,
like, tube-like...

10:47.791 --> 10:50.666
But it's actually just "penne"
is just the Italian for "penne."

10:50.750 --> 10:52.750
Did you just buy that to piss me off?

10:52.833 --> 10:54.333
No, I wore it 'cause it looks cool.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.041
The testicles. Hm.

12:02.458 --> 12:04.500
-Shall we go in?
-Yeah.

12:04.583 --> 12:05.958
Yes, let's go in. Let's go in.

12:06.041 --> 12:07.833
How long have you been
in the cabaret business?

12:07.916 --> 12:09.541
I'm not. I'm a music producer.

12:09.625 --> 12:12.083
-Who the hell's this other Chaz guy?
-Don't worry about it.

12:12.166 --> 12:15.125
My balls. My dear, old balls.
I think they'll be fine.

12:15.208 --> 12:17.541
It's just sort of working out a way
of managing them.

12:17.625 --> 12:19.666
[romantic instrumental music playing]

12:37.541 --> 12:38.666
All right, you ready?

12:40.583 --> 12:41.625
Yeah. [laughs]

12:41.708 --> 12:42.791
Yeah, I think so.

12:43.833 --> 12:44.666
Come on.

12:45.458 --> 12:46.500
Wait, Jack, um...

12:47.208 --> 12:48.625
-Look, I--
-What's up?

12:49.666 --> 12:51.208
You know that I would've...

12:52.541 --> 12:54.750
I would've given anything for Dad
to be here today.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.125
But having you walk me
down the aisle is...

12:58.208 --> 12:59.666
-Oh...
-...is the next best thing

12:59.750 --> 13:01.625
that I could ask for, so...

13:04.291 --> 13:05.375
[Hayley clicks her tongue]

13:08.541 --> 13:11.375
Also, can you look after
my bag of pills, please?

13:11.958 --> 13:12.791
Thanks.

13:13.166 --> 13:14.000
Sure.

13:18.125 --> 13:19.416
Let's get you hitched.

13:19.708 --> 13:20.583
Getting hitched!

13:20.666 --> 13:22.083
-Aah!

13:22.166 --> 13:23.416
-Come on.
-Okay.

-[Jack] He'll be here.

13:47.750 --> 13:49.833
[Hayley] Why is he getting
a fucking haircut now?

13:49.916 --> 13:50.958
What's wrong with him?

13:51.041 --> 13:53.666
Oh, God! Why did I decide to do this?

13:54.291 --> 13:55.666
Because you love him.

13:57.333 --> 13:58.250
[Jack] All right?

13:58.750 --> 14:00.500
[Hayley chuckles]

14:02.875 --> 14:03.708
Yeah.

14:06.250 --> 14:08.125
Okay. Let's do this.

14:09.041 --> 14:10.583
Oh, no. I nearly forgot to tell you.

14:10.666 --> 14:13.250
You remember Dina,
my American friend that you met in Rome?

14:13.333 --> 14:14.541
-Yeah.
-She's here.

14:16.208 --> 14:17.791
Uh... [stammers]

14:17.875 --> 14:18.958
-What?
-Yeah.

14:19.583 --> 14:21.250
Sorry, wait, wait, wait...

14:21.333 --> 14:23.166
You said she definitely couldn't come,

14:23.250 --> 14:25.333
and besides that, she had
a boyfriend anyway, right?

14:25.416 --> 14:28.833
Yeah, well, it turns out she can come,
and she's broken up with her boyfriend.

14:28.916 --> 14:31.125
-Yeah. Come on, let's go.
-W-Wait.

14:32.333 --> 14:33.250
Okay.

14:34.375 --> 14:35.250
Okay.

[Jack] Hello.

15:32.583 --> 15:33.541
Hi.

15:35.458 --> 15:36.666
Hello. Um...

15:37.833 --> 15:39.083
Okay!

Nice to meet you all.

15:44.875 --> 15:46.625
-He just kissed me full on the mouth.
-Me too.

15:46.708 --> 15:48.125
I think I got some tongue, actually.

15:48.208 --> 15:49.625
Oh, you're <i>not</i> in the cabaret.

15:49.708 --> 15:51.000
I love your suit, though.

15:51.083 --> 15:52.458
-Good, innit? Thank you.
-Yeah.

15:52.541 --> 15:55.291
My six-year-old nephew
has one just exactly like that.

15:55.625 --> 15:57.833
-Six-year-old nephew.
-Sounds like a pretty cool kid.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.958
Yeah, except his trousers
are attached to the top half,

16:00.041 --> 16:02.666
and he's just got this little flap
to let his little [blows raspberry] out.

16:02.750 --> 16:05.083
-No, this has got the classic zip.
-[zips fly]

16:05.875 --> 16:08.708
Look, I suppose I should go mingle
with my new relatives.

16:08.791 --> 16:09.916
Go, go, go.

16:11.625 --> 16:14.000
-Don't get emotional.
-No, I won't, I won't, I won't.

16:15.041 --> 16:15.875
Oh, man.

16:15.958 --> 16:17.708
-She looks so happy.
-Yeah.

16:19.041 --> 16:20.250
Did you even get your hair cut?

16:20.333 --> 16:22.166
-It looks exactly the same.
-No, it doesn't.

16:22.250 --> 16:23.166
-It does.
-It's rounder.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.625
-Mate--
-It's rounder, Jack.

16:37.208 --> 16:38.458
[sighs deeply]

16:39.708 --> 16:40.541
Hot.

16:41.541 --> 16:43.291
-Yeah, it's really hot today.
-Very hot.

16:43.375 --> 16:44.416
It's pretty, though.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.625
Oh, what a dress!

16:45.708 --> 16:46.958
-Thank you very much.
-Beautiful.

16:47.041 --> 16:49.666
Appreciate that. You as well.
I mean, it's not-- It's not a dress.

16:50.166 --> 16:51.041
This is a kilt.

16:51.708 --> 16:53.375
[chuckles] Yeah, I know. Yeah.

16:53.916 --> 16:56.458
Traditional Scottish... dress.

16:56.541 --> 16:58.166
-Right. I knew that.
-Yes.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.125
I'm not Scottish.

16:59.208 --> 17:00.333
-You're not?
-No.

17:00.416 --> 17:01.875
Then why are you wearing a kilt?

17:10.166 --> 17:12.166
[exhales] The old Italian sun.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.000
Huh.

17:16.625 --> 17:17.791

17:18.958 --> 17:19.958
Um... Oh.

17:20.041 --> 17:20.875
Deary me.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.625
I don't think you--

17:22.708 --> 17:23.916
I don't think you should...

17:24.333 --> 17:25.708
So, where's your other half?

17:26.208 --> 17:27.458
Oh, no other half.

17:27.541 --> 17:29.333
Just, you know, half a person today.

17:29.625 --> 17:31.291
-I'm half a person.
-You are?

17:31.375 --> 17:32.625
Oh, well...

17:33.166 --> 17:34.791
-Deal?
-Deal.

17:35.375 --> 17:36.416
-Wedding buddies.
-Oh.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.166
Is that-- That was the deal we made?

17:38.250 --> 17:39.791
-We shook on it.
-We shook.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.666
What do wedding buddies do?

17:42.000 --> 17:43.708
We hang out a little bit.

17:49.916 --> 17:51.416
-Would you like a drink?
-I'm good--

17:51.500 --> 17:52.500
They're free.

17:52.958 --> 17:54.000
-Two champagnes?
-Yeah.

17:54.083 --> 17:56.000
-It is, uh, free, but--
-I'll be right back.

17:56.083 --> 17:57.833
-No, I'm okay.
-You don't go anywhere.

17:59.625 --> 18:00.541

18:03.416 --> 18:05.041
-[Bryan] God, there he is.
-[Jack] Who?

18:05.125 --> 18:06.000

18:06.083 --> 18:08.583
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah. He makes movie stars, Jack.

18:08.666 --> 18:09.541
Movie stars.

18:09.625 --> 18:11.458
I've got one chance to impress him.

18:11.541 --> 18:13.375
Maybe you can do it
with your speech later on.

18:13.458 --> 18:14.333
Yeah.

18:15.000 --> 18:15.875
What speech?

18:15.958 --> 18:17.291
Your maid of honor speech.

18:17.375 --> 18:19.250
No one told me I've got
a maid of honor speech.

18:19.333 --> 18:21.875
-Yeah, it's in the program.
-No, I don't think I do.

18:22.416 --> 18:23.875
Oh, no!

18:24.208 --> 18:26.416
-I've got nothing prepared!
-[Jack] It's gonna be fine.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.583
-It's not gonna be fine.
-Just riff one out, man!

18:28.666 --> 18:30.125
-Shit, there's Rebecca.
-Just vibe it.

18:30.208 --> 18:32.250
Don't leave me alone with her, please.
She clings on.

-Oi, boys!

18:38.416 --> 18:40.666
That's the fun car,
ready to pick you all up.

18:40.750 --> 18:41.916

-You look brilliant.

-Thanks.
-I love your suit.

19:23.750 --> 19:24.916
Thanks a lot, yeah. I just...

or something, I think.

You look great.

19:46.500 --> 19:47.333
Thanks.

19:47.708 --> 19:49.791
Still can't believe you made me come
all the way out here

19:49.875 --> 19:51.958
just to stare at the guy
you were shagging for two years.

19:52.041 --> 19:53.291
Stop staring at him, then.

19:54.333 --> 19:55.416
At least you got an upgrade.

19:55.791 --> 19:58.291
-Pfft! What upgrade?
-What do you mean, "what upgrade"?

19:58.375 --> 19:59.791
I'm better looking than him,

19:59.875 --> 20:01.833
I'm taller,
and I'm definitely better in bed.

20:01.916 --> 20:03.666
How do you know?
Have you slept with him?

20:03.750 --> 20:05.750
Well, no. It's obvious, look at him.
He's just...

20:05.833 --> 20:07.083
What do you mean?

20:07.166 --> 20:08.791
Are you saying
that he's better in bed than me?

20:08.875 --> 20:10.958
You know what?
I haven't had time for a full analysis.

20:11.041 --> 20:13.000
Really? Well, I have.
I've literally asked people,

20:13.083 --> 20:14.583
and they've all pretty much said,

20:14.666 --> 20:16.083
"Yeah, you're great. Cheers, mate."

I love you so much.

the best day ever.

-Yeah, yeah.

what she was trying to say.

You're surprised to see me?

22:11.875 --> 22:14.541
Yeah, I am a bit.
I mean, everyone else was invited.

22:14.875 --> 22:15.708
What do you want?

22:28.458 --> 22:32.083
Uh, I am already in a happy couple
with my husband,

22:32.166 --> 22:33.583
who's just in that next room.

22:33.666 --> 22:35.041
-Hello!
-[woman] Beautiful wedding.

22:35.125 --> 22:37.125
So nice of you.
I'll come and find you in a moment.

22:37.208 --> 22:38.208
I'll come and find you.

22:38.291 --> 22:39.875
I've told you several times,
I am not--

22:39.958 --> 22:41.583
-[in Italian] Congratulations.
-Thank you.

22:41.666 --> 22:44.166
-I am not interested.
-No, I know, I know, I know.

22:44.250 --> 22:46.791
Because-- Because you thought
I didn't really love you,

22:46.875 --> 22:49.666
but now I'm proving that I do
by doing something properly romantic.

22:49.750 --> 22:52.208
This is not properly romantic,
this is psychopathic!

22:52.291 --> 22:53.541
Please, Marc, just leave.

22:53.625 --> 22:55.416
-Just leave now, please.
-I just got here.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.583
If you don't leave,
I will have security throw you out.

22:57.666 --> 22:59.541
Uh, why-- why don't you try that?

22:59.625 --> 23:00.708
See what happens.

23:01.250 --> 23:02.875
-Listen, you tosser--
-Hayley.

23:03.375 --> 23:05.250
-Hey.
-Oh, Roberto. [laughs nervously]

23:05.333 --> 23:07.791
Is this one of your English friends
I'm always hearing about?

23:07.875 --> 23:09.375
Hi, I'm Roberto.

23:09.458 --> 23:11.125
-[Marc chuckles]
-Yes, yes, this is, uh...

23:11.791 --> 23:13.750
[stammers] This is Marc.

23:13.833 --> 23:16.666
Um, but he just popped in
and, sadly, can't stay.

23:16.750 --> 23:19.291
-Yes, I can.
-No. No, you can't, because...

23:19.375 --> 23:21.875
well, there's, um... there's nowhere
for you to sit, for a start.

23:21.958 --> 23:23.791
Oh, no, no, it's no problem.

23:23.958 --> 23:27.166
Your cousin, Laura, couldn't make it,
so we can put him on the English table.

23:27.250 --> 23:28.458
Oh!

23:28.541 --> 23:30.166
There you go. Perfect.

23:30.250 --> 23:31.583
-Come. I'll organize.
-Brilliant.

23:31.666 --> 23:33.166
-Roberto, just...
-[Roberto] Come on.

23:33.250 --> 23:34.166
Um...

23:34.500 --> 23:35.458
Yes...

23:37.000 --> 23:37.833
[quietly] Fuck!

23:38.541 --> 23:39.416
[Jack] What about you?

23:39.500 --> 23:41.500
-You had a boyfriend.
-[Dina] Yeah. No more, though.

23:41.583 --> 23:44.291
He thought it was a good idea to sleep
with almost all of his staff.

23:44.375 --> 23:45.583
-[Jack] Ouch.
-So, yeah.

23:45.666 --> 23:48.958
So it was either fly out for Hayley's
beautiful wedding in Rome,

23:49.041 --> 23:51.250
or go home
and kick the living fuck out of him.

23:51.333 --> 23:52.333
[Jack] It's not too late.

23:52.416 --> 23:55.875
You know, you could always kick
the fuck out of him when you get back.

23:55.958 --> 23:56.833
Best of both worlds.

23:56.916 --> 23:59.125
[Dina] I get back on Tuesday.
I can fuck him up then.

23:59.416 --> 24:00.458
[Jack stammers]

24:00.875 --> 24:01.875
Just before we...

24:02.666 --> 24:03.500
Yeah?

24:05.500 --> 24:06.333
Uh...

24:08.208 --> 24:10.416
I... I used to ask about you...

24:11.375 --> 24:12.291
all the time.

24:12.541 --> 24:13.583
[chuckles softly]

24:15.166 --> 24:16.583
I used to ask about you, too.

24:20.833 --> 24:22.000
[Jack] There she is!

24:22.083 --> 24:25.583
-Hi! You look so beautiful!
-So do you. It's so great to see you.

24:25.916 --> 24:28.000
-I'm just gonna borrow him. One second.
-Yeah.

24:28.083 --> 24:29.375
We'll be right back. Sorry.

24:29.458 --> 24:31.458
Hold that thought, please. Hold it.

24:52.333 --> 24:54.458
She's even more gorgeous than I remember.

24:54.708 --> 24:56.375
Look, I know you're busy,

24:56.458 --> 24:58.291
but you said there was an English table.

24:58.375 --> 24:59.333
Is she on that table?

24:59.416 --> 25:01.625
Can you just--
Can you shut up for a second?

25:01.916 --> 25:04.083
Just listen to me
'cause I've got a bit of a problem.

25:04.166 --> 25:06.458
-Fine. What is it?
-Marc Fisher is here.

25:06.666 --> 25:08.250
-What, the creep from school?
-Yes.

25:08.333 --> 25:09.958
Why the hell did you invite him?

25:10.041 --> 25:11.833
I didn't invite him, he just came.

25:11.916 --> 25:13.083
Well, just tell him to leave.

25:13.166 --> 25:15.208
You can't just turn up
to a wedding uninvited.

25:15.291 --> 25:16.375
Jack, you don't understand.

25:16.458 --> 25:18.375
He's saying that he's in love with me,

25:18.458 --> 25:21.333
and he's threatening to go full-on psycho
and ruin my wedding!

25:21.958 --> 25:24.166
-He's what?
-I know. He's fucking nuts.

25:24.250 --> 25:26.333
And he's fucking coked up to his eyeballs!

25:26.666 --> 25:28.958
All right. Okay. Don't worry.
I'll-- I'll get him out.

25:29.041 --> 25:31.375
You can't! He's too volatile.
God knows how he'll react.

25:31.458 --> 25:34.583
-All right. So what, then?
-I don't know! I don't know! I don't know!

25:35.000 --> 25:36.458
Oh, God. Have you got my pills?

25:37.250 --> 25:39.958
Come on. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

-God, you better have a bucket.

25:43.166 --> 25:44.458
Fuck!

25:44.958 --> 25:45.791
Just don't vom--

25:45.875 --> 25:47.208
-Oh, my God.
-What?

25:47.291 --> 25:48.333
What? What? What?

25:49.666 --> 25:50.875
Yes. Yes.

25:51.541 --> 25:53.625
This is the sleep medicine
that I've been taking.

25:53.708 --> 25:55.708
Couple of drops of this,
it would knock him out for hours.

25:55.791 --> 25:57.041
It's seriously strong.

25:57.625 --> 25:59.416
-Sorry, what?
-[laughs]

25:59.500 --> 26:03.083
And Roberto has put him on your table.
Oh, my God, it's perfect.

26:03.166 --> 26:06.000
Just put a couple of drops of that
in his champagne glass.

26:06.083 --> 26:06.958
It'll be brilliant.

26:07.041 --> 26:09.666

-Yes?

Are you fucking mental?

I'm not gonna roofie Marc Fisher.

26:16.875 --> 26:18.083
Listen, Jack.

26:18.166 --> 26:20.875
Marc is just about mad enough
to ruin this whole wedding

26:20.958 --> 26:23.500
and humiliate me
in front of my new family,

-I've been with her for about a year.
-Whoa!

32:02.000 --> 32:04.166
Yeah, and she's chose
to sit next to her ex-boyfriend

32:04.250 --> 32:06.000
over her actual boyfriend, so...

32:06.083 --> 32:07.250
[Rebecca] It is pretty rude.

32:07.333 --> 32:11.041
Especially when you consider
what sort of, um, relationship they had.

32:11.125 --> 32:13.416
-What do you mean?
-It was all very physical, you know?

32:13.500 --> 32:14.791
I personally don't believe

32:14.875 --> 32:18.166
that any sort of meaningful relationship
is ever built on that much sex,

32:18.250 --> 32:20.208
so it is kind of weird
that they'd sit together.

32:20.291 --> 32:22.000
It's just like more... [blows raspberry]

32:22.083 --> 32:22.958
And less, like...

32:23.041 --> 32:24.666
-Do you know what I mean?
-Yes. Yeah.

32:24.750 --> 32:26.500

32:26.583 --> 32:29.666
And, you know, where does that sort
of thing end up, you know?

32:29.750 --> 32:32.125
Sorry, mate, can we get a proper drink?

32:32.208 --> 32:33.541
All about the... [blows raspberry]

32:33.625 --> 32:35.583
And not about the... [claps]
Know what I mean?

32:35.666 --> 32:36.500
[Chaz] Yeah. Yeah.

32:36.875 --> 32:39.500
I see you're wearing
the cuff links I bought you.

32:40.791 --> 32:42.000
Oh, yeah. [chuckles]

32:42.500 --> 32:44.166
Well, they were the only ones I had, so...

32:46.125 --> 32:46.958
Fuck you.

32:48.250 --> 32:50.833
So, um, I hear you're a journalist.

32:51.833 --> 32:53.000
-Yeah.
-In journalism.

32:53.750 --> 32:54.791
Yes, that's right.

32:54.875 --> 32:56.333
Yes, got it in one.

32:56.541 --> 32:57.625
[both chuckle]

32:57.708 --> 32:59.333
So, what is that? Fashion stuff?

33:00.000 --> 33:01.291
No, I'm a war journalist.

33:01.375 --> 33:02.750
I think someone said-- Hang on.

33:02.833 --> 33:03.875
Did you get kidnapped?

33:04.208 --> 33:05.166
Yes. Yeah.

33:05.875 --> 33:06.708
Whoops.

33:06.791 --> 33:08.958
-Yeah, whoops.
-Big whoops. No, not whoops.

33:09.041 --> 33:11.375
But you know what I mean, like, careless.
Well, not careless.

33:11.458 --> 33:13.416
-No, not careless.
-So what happened there?

33:13.833 --> 33:15.750
We were on a report in Afghanistan and--

33:15.833 --> 33:17.750
Oh, there's your first mistake.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.708
Afghanistan, if you please.

33:22.041 --> 33:23.458
And what happened? Don't tell me.

33:23.583 --> 33:25.375
Um, well, the Taliban--

33:25.458 --> 33:27.750
-The Taliban,<i> quelle suprise.</i> Yeah.
-Right.

33:27.833 --> 33:31.125
Yeah, there were Taliban forces
who came into our space--

33:31.208 --> 33:32.166
Uninvited?

33:33.541 --> 33:34.958
-Yeah.
-Of course they were.

33:35.041 --> 33:37.250
-Of course.
-Why are you inviting the Taliban?

33:38.333 --> 33:40.291
Doing a report in Afghanistan,

33:40.375 --> 33:42.916
and the Taliban forces came in
and took us outside,

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
-lined us up, held guns to our heads--
-What were you wearing?

33:45.083 --> 33:47.041
-What?
-What were you wearing?

33:47.125 --> 33:48.791
Because, obviously, this would be, um...

33:49.708 --> 33:50.541
not for them.

33:50.625 --> 33:53.291
Out there they don't like the, um,
exposed...

33:55.291 --> 33:56.166
breast.

33:57.208 --> 33:58.875
Not that this is exposed. This is...

33:59.583 --> 34:00.958
This is... Yeah.

34:01.041 --> 34:03.000
Absolutely... very well judged.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.250
I'd kidnap you.

34:04.333 --> 34:05.250
-Oh.
-Mm-hmm.

34:06.625 --> 34:09.125
[Rebecca] The proof was in the pudding.
They ended up breaking up.

34:09.208 --> 34:11.708
Well, no, because she keeps talking
about his massive dick, so...

34:11.791 --> 34:15.291
-Really?
-Yeah, well, mine's big anyway, so...

34:15.375 --> 34:17.708
-How big?
-Bigger than his, probably.

34:17.791 --> 34:19.458
What you talking about? A spoon or a fork?

34:19.541 --> 34:21.500
-Both.
-Can you point out on the table what size?

34:21.625 --> 34:23.250
Both. Stuck together.

34:23.333 --> 34:24.916
-Those two stuck together?
-Yes.

34:26.166 --> 34:28.750
["Non più andrai" by Mozart playing]

34:32.583 --> 34:36.083
-Who's the American?
-Oh, that's Hayley's friend, Dina.

34:36.166 --> 34:39.166
God, yeah, the lady you met in Rome
and wouldn't stop going on about.

34:39.250 --> 34:40.291
I don't go on about her.

34:40.375 --> 34:43.458
Oh, come on, you found every excuse
in the world to talk about her.

34:43.541 --> 34:46.416
We'd been there for, uh, many days.

34:46.500 --> 34:50.291
We actually had no idea if it was,
you know, day or night at that point and--

34:50.375 --> 34:51.666
I'm in car insurance.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.375
-What?
-I'm in car insurance.

34:58.166 --> 34:59.375
-Okay.
-It is okay.

34:59.708 --> 35:00.666
Oh, okay.

35:00.750 --> 35:02.916
It's not as boring as it sounds,
thank you.

35:04.125 --> 35:06.875
-I'm sorry. Go ahead.
-That's fine. So, yes, um...

35:06.958 --> 35:10.958
I work with a couple of guys
called Jim and, um, Jeff.

35:11.166 --> 35:13.458
Well, I call him Jeff.
Jim calls him Jeffrey.

35:13.916 --> 35:16.041
Jim started in 2001.

35:16.583 --> 35:18.041
And then Jeff started...

35:18.125 --> 35:19.375
-Lovely.
-Thanks.

35:19.458 --> 35:20.291
<i>Grazie.</i>

35:20.750 --> 35:21.916
<i>-Grazie.</i>
-That's it.

35:22.291 --> 35:25.416
And then Jeff started
a couple of years after that...

35:25.500 --> 35:27.083
[Bryan] I thought she had a boyfriend.

35:27.166 --> 35:28.541
Well, not anymore.

35:28.916 --> 35:31.000
Turns out he cheated on her
really horrifically.

35:31.083 --> 35:32.500
Oh, that's great, man.

35:32.583 --> 35:34.833
That's great. You should really
take your chance this time.

35:34.916 --> 35:36.416
Well, now I intend to.

35:36.500 --> 35:40.375
[Sidney] So, yes, Jim and Jeff
are hilarious.

35:40.458 --> 35:42.541
God, you're slinging 'em back,
aren't you?

35:43.000 --> 35:45.458
-You know, if the situation calls for it.
-Oh, sure.

35:45.541 --> 35:46.375
Which it does.

35:46.458 --> 35:48.375
Were you allowed to drink
when you were kidnapped?

35:48.458 --> 35:51.083
["The Blue Danube Waltz" playing]

36:09.333 --> 36:11.041
[Sidney] Another time.
I must tell you this.

36:11.125 --> 36:13.416
I've parked my bike
and outside it's spring,

36:13.500 --> 36:15.375
and locked her up, and I go in,

36:16.000 --> 36:16.958
open the door,

36:17.041 --> 36:18.041
and, um, syrup.

36:18.791 --> 36:19.791
-What?
-Syrup.

36:19.875 --> 36:21.833
-Syrup?
-Syrup all on the door handle.

36:21.916 --> 36:24.541
To the extent that there's syrup
actually on the floor underneath it.

36:24.625 --> 36:26.333
-On the carpet.
-Another Jeff bit?

36:26.416 --> 36:27.750
Jim. What, Jeff?

36:28.333 --> 36:29.833
I said, "Jeff bit," like Jeff--

36:29.916 --> 36:31.916
No, this is not Jeff. This is before Jeff.

36:32.458 --> 36:33.458
Oh, I'm sorry, I--

36:33.833 --> 36:35.041
Yeah, you're right, it's...

36:36.625 --> 36:38.750
This is Jim. Am I talking to myself?

36:38.833 --> 36:39.666
[laughs] No.

36:39.958 --> 36:41.916
Jeff didn't start until 2008.

36:42.666 --> 36:43.625
No, hang on a minute.

36:43.708 --> 36:44.916
I'd got rid of the bike,

36:45.000 --> 36:47.666
so he would've started in the spring...

36:47.750 --> 36:48.583
of...

36:48.791 --> 36:51.166
two thousand and...

36:51.708 --> 36:52.708
wait for it...

36:53.458 --> 36:55.708
-You know what? Don't worry about it.
-May as well get it.

36:55.791 --> 36:56.625
[whispers] Bryan.

36:57.750 --> 36:59.458
Bryan, can you do me a favor, mate?

36:59.958 --> 37:02.791
Could you keep an eye on Marc?
If he moves, just come and grab me.

37:04.166 --> 37:05.958
I'm gonna make my move. [clicks tongue]

37:06.041 --> 37:06.875
Wish me luck.

37:07.291 --> 37:09.666
[Sidney] It was 2006, back on in--

37:09.750 --> 37:11.583
Yes, 2008. Yes, here he his.

37:11.666 --> 37:13.208
-Sorry to interrupt.
-Hello.

37:13.291 --> 37:16.750
Good, man. Um, just wondering if you
want to grab a drink at the bar.

37:16.833 --> 37:19.500
-I would love to. Excuse us.
-That sounds fantastic!

37:23.958 --> 37:24.791
Okay.

37:25.041 --> 37:27.625
-[Sidney] You coming, Jack?
-Yeah. Of course.

37:41.750 --> 37:43.625
[guests applauding]

37:44.541 --> 37:45.875
Oh, Vitelli.

37:46.333 --> 37:48.375
-What? Where are you going?
-Vitelli.

37:48.625 --> 37:50.958
-Oh, do you want me to come with you?
-God, no.

37:51.875 --> 37:52.708
Cool.

37:54.750 --> 37:56.666
[in Italian] Oh... I told you...

37:56.750 --> 37:57.583
[laughs]

37:58.708 --> 38:00.500
Mr... Mr. Vitelli.

38:01.416 --> 38:02.833
-Yeah?
-My name is Bryan.

38:02.958 --> 38:04.500
[Vitelli] Oh, nice to meet you.

38:05.291 --> 38:06.125
Bryan?

38:09.541 --> 38:11.458
Mm. Sorry. Um...

38:11.541 --> 38:13.250
Would you mind if I sit down?

38:14.875 --> 38:16.166
I just want to sit down.

38:17.875 --> 38:19.166
It's okay, Bryan. Can I help you?

38:19.250 --> 38:20.541
-Oh, yes.
-Yeah?

38:20.625 --> 38:24.916
Mr. Vitelli, I just wanted to say
that I am such a huge fan.

38:25.458 --> 38:27.958
-Thank you. Thank you very much.
-No, really, I am.

38:28.208 --> 38:33.833
And I would just be fascinated
to understand where you get the...

38:35.125 --> 38:36.500
[slurring] ...idea for your films.

38:36.833 --> 38:38.250
-The ideas?
-The ideas.

38:38.333 --> 38:39.458
Oh, well... [chuckles]

38:39.541 --> 38:40.458
Uh...

38:40.916 --> 38:43.416
Well, you know,
the thing about ideas is that...

38:43.750 --> 38:44.750
Hmm.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.500
...they're not created.

38:46.583 --> 38:48.500
They come to you just like...

38:49.083 --> 38:51.041
um, happy accidents.

38:51.583 --> 38:54.208
You know what I mean?
Inside you. Just really...

38:55.333 --> 38:57.625
from somewhere inside you.
Some secret, dark...

38:58.333 --> 39:00.708
-Dark place.
-...blind place inside of you.

39:00.791 --> 39:01.916
That's brilliant.

39:02.833 --> 39:04.000
[murmuring]

39:07.833 --> 39:08.708
Hey, man?

39:16.166 --> 39:17.041
Mm.

39:17.916 --> 39:18.750
Vitelli.

39:19.916 --> 39:20.750
[sighs]

39:20.833 --> 39:23.166
-Okay, thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

39:23.250 --> 39:24.083
Thank you.

39:27.208 --> 39:29.125
-It's been nice to talk with you.
-Thank you.

39:29.208 --> 39:30.125
Yeah.

39:30.416 --> 39:31.250
Thank you.

39:34.458 --> 39:35.375
[chuckles]

39:35.458 --> 39:36.291
How'd it go?

39:36.750 --> 39:37.583
Hm?

39:37.666 --> 39:40.166
-Vitelli? How did it go?
-Yeah, all right.

39:40.250 --> 39:41.666
Oh, my God, I knew it.

39:41.750 --> 39:43.333
What a story. What a night.

39:43.416 --> 39:45.833
That is nuts.
I can see that you're buzzin'.

39:56.041 --> 39:58.458
Jeff's stood there, laughing.
He's still got the glove on.

39:58.541 --> 40:00.208
-Laughing behind the glove.
-Oh.

40:00.291 --> 40:02.375
Still, also with the purple track suit.

40:02.458 --> 40:05.708
And I'm like, "Yeah, that worked.
That worked. As planned."

40:05.791 --> 40:07.166
-Sidney, sorry.
-Mm.

40:07.833 --> 40:09.958
I'd hate to sound rude, but, um...

40:11.083 --> 40:12.541
I was just kind of hoping

40:12.625 --> 40:15.458
to have kind of a private chat.

40:15.541 --> 40:17.291
As in...

40:17.375 --> 40:18.583
just the two of us.

40:19.041 --> 40:19.958
Man to man.

40:21.791 --> 40:23.166
Would you mind just, um...?

40:26.708 --> 40:28.000
Okay, Sidney?

40:28.083 --> 40:30.916
-Yes, Jack?
-What I meant, uh...

40:31.666 --> 40:32.958
I meant Dina and me.

40:35.041 --> 40:36.041
[stammers]

40:36.250 --> 40:37.250
So, where do I go?

40:37.333 --> 40:38.666
I mean, I don't know, man.

40:39.041 --> 40:40.166
Uh, over there?

40:40.583 --> 40:42.000
-Over there?
-Yeah.

40:46.416 --> 40:47.291
I'll pop off.

40:47.958 --> 40:50.291
Yeah, you're cool.
I'll see you in a minute.

40:50.375 --> 40:51.583
-You're cool, too.
-Okay.

40:53.125 --> 40:54.291
-Oh!
-I feel awful.

40:54.666 --> 40:56.250
That felt horrible.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.125
Look at you, you're such a baller.

41:06.208 --> 41:09.291
You're so chilled out about it. I love it.
I think you're amazing.

41:09.375 --> 41:11.333
I actually do think you're amazing.

41:11.416 --> 41:12.416
But whatever, you know?

41:12.500 --> 41:14.041
[Marc imitates a revving engine]

41:14.125 --> 41:15.333
[panting, sniffing]

41:15.958 --> 41:17.375
[Marc] <i>She loves you. She loves you!</i>

41:17.458 --> 41:18.291
[babbling]

41:19.166 --> 41:20.125
[whispers] She's yours.

41:21.083 --> 41:21.916
You got this.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.208
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>
<i>She definitely loves you.</i>

41:27.833 --> 41:31.333
Quickly, before Sidney gets back.
Just tell me what you've been up to.

41:31.416 --> 41:32.458
Quickly? Just tell you--

41:32.541 --> 41:35.083
Tell me everything you've done
in three years in ten seconds.

41:35.166 --> 41:36.291
-Just...
-Sid can do that.

41:36.375 --> 41:39.791
Since the last time I saw you,
I've had a failed relationship.

41:39.875 --> 41:41.750
Amanda, who's sat right next to me.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.125
Um... [stammers]

41:43.208 --> 41:45.166
Then I went to Asia, traveled around,

41:45.250 --> 41:47.791
got a horrible disease, um, came back,

41:47.875 --> 41:50.750
and then I just recently qualified
as a structural engineer...

41:51.041 --> 41:52.666
at last. [chuckles]

41:52.750 --> 41:54.000
Hey! That was eight seconds!

41:54.083 --> 41:55.750
-You were actually counting?
-Mm-hmm.

41:55.833 --> 41:59.583
I mean, you have two seconds left,
but you don't have anything to fill.

41:59.666 --> 42:02.291
No, I really don't.
It's a sad, sad, sad admission.

42:02.375 --> 42:04.583
I mean, that's a lot of just... blah.

42:04.666 --> 42:07.083
[speaking in Italian]

42:09.875 --> 42:11.750
-Hey.
-Sorry, just one second.

42:13.333 --> 42:14.541
You're-- You're awake.

42:14.625 --> 42:16.041
I'm awake. Of course I'm awake.

42:16.125 --> 42:18.458
Why wouldn't I be awake?
Anyway, we need to talk.

42:20.083 --> 42:21.458
Right. Um, yes.

42:21.541 --> 42:24.291
Just as long as you're not going to say
that we're meant to be together.

42:24.583 --> 42:25.708
Oh, uh...

42:26.750 --> 42:27.833
We are meant to be together.

42:28.333 --> 42:30.041
What planet are you on, Marc?

42:30.750 --> 42:32.583
Do you want me to just tattoo it
on my forehead?

42:32.666 --> 42:34.291
I love Roberto.

42:34.583 --> 42:36.041
Uh, no.

42:37.666 --> 42:38.666
What do you mean, "no"?

42:38.750 --> 42:40.916
The connection between us is undeniable.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.583
You're just scared of telling Roberto,
but it's okay, it's okay.

42:43.666 --> 42:46.583
He does need to know,
so you tell him, or I'll do it for you.

43:32.958 --> 43:34.625
So, come on. Your turn.

43:35.041 --> 43:37.333
I was a foreign correspondent,
as you might remember.

43:37.416 --> 43:40.500
I went off to some very horrific places.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.291
I saw a lot of people get shot.
I was kidnapped.

43:43.375 --> 43:44.291
Came back home.

43:44.375 --> 43:46.416
My mom got sick and died.

43:46.500 --> 43:48.208
And I found out that my boyfriend

43:48.291 --> 43:51.916
loves having sex with anything
with an available orifice, so...

43:54.416 --> 43:55.250
That's...

43:55.625 --> 43:56.833
-Wow.
-That's it.

43:57.833 --> 43:59.708
-Um...
-Yeah. [chuckles]

44:00.166 --> 44:01.125
I'm sorry.

44:01.458 --> 44:03.750
Oh, yeah, it's okay. It's just--
You know, it's life.

44:03.833 --> 44:06.125
No, I mean I'm sorry
that it was 12 seconds.

44:06.208 --> 44:07.208
[laughs]

44:07.291 --> 44:08.208
So, that's...

44:08.625 --> 44:10.458
Oh, it means you lose.

44:11.083 --> 44:11.958
Wow.

44:12.041 --> 44:12.916
Well, let's...

44:13.625 --> 44:14.583
Hey, let's just hope...

44:15.375 --> 44:17.541
it's only good luck from now, right?

44:18.000 --> 44:19.416
Yeah, fingers crossed.

-Just here is fine. Just here.

44:37.041 --> 44:38.541
-You okay?
-No, not really.

44:38.625 --> 44:40.875
-Marc is still totally fucking wide awake!
-What? How?

44:40.958 --> 44:42.666
Jesus, Jack. It was a simple plan.

44:42.750 --> 44:44.291
How did you mess this up?

44:44.375 --> 44:45.375
[stammers] Hey!

44:45.458 --> 44:47.791
You do know this is my first time
spiking someone's drink.

44:47.875 --> 44:48.750
Shush!

44:48.833 --> 44:51.500
-I already feel awful about it, and now--
-Yeah, I know.

44:51.583 --> 44:55.125
Look, please, will you just make sure
he doesn't go anywhere near Roberto?

44:55.208 --> 44:56.458
I have to go and do something.

44:56.541 --> 44:58.916
-What do you have to go do?
-Just more fucking photos!

44:59.500 --> 45:00.791
How's it going with Dina?

45:01.250 --> 45:03.041
Yeah, no, it's good, it's good, it's good.

45:03.125 --> 45:04.333
-It's good.
-That's great.

45:04.416 --> 45:06.291
You know what, though?
It's like Mum used to say.

45:06.375 --> 45:08.416
You expect the worst,
but hope for the best,

45:08.500 --> 45:10.208
and I feel like this is our moment.

45:10.291 --> 45:12.458
-This is-- This is--
-Yeah, that's great. Great.

-Hi.

-I'm Cristina.
-Would you mind holding that, Cristina?

45:32.000 --> 45:32.833
a bit of admin.

45:47.625 --> 45:48.541
Ah.

45:48.958 --> 45:49.833
Just unwrapping.

45:54.250 --> 45:55.416
Hm. Hey presto.

45:56.208 --> 45:58.083
Thank you. I'm Sidney.

45:58.166 --> 45:59.000
Okay.

45:59.625 --> 46:00.500
Okay.

46:01.208 --> 46:02.083
That's okay.

46:02.833 --> 46:03.750
[Sidney] Off she goes.

46:11.666 --> 46:12.541
[Chaz] Mm!

46:12.958 --> 46:14.458
Hey, man. Uh...

46:14.583 --> 46:15.416
All right?

46:15.500 --> 46:17.208
I was gonna say, well done back there.

46:18.000 --> 46:18.833
Excuse me?

46:18.916 --> 46:20.291
No, it's the way you orchestrated

46:20.375 --> 46:22.791
that you'd be sitting next to Amanda
at the wedding. [chuckles]

46:23.750 --> 46:27.125
What, you think I wanted to sit next to
my ex-girlfriend at my sister's wedding?

46:27.208 --> 46:28.708
But I'm not a masochist.

46:28.791 --> 46:31.291
-Bit of a coincidence, though, isn't it?
-Is it, though?

46:31.375 --> 46:32.833
Yeah, it is. You know, yeah.

46:32.916 --> 46:35.666
Look, uh, mate, um...

46:35.750 --> 46:38.875
Amanda and I are totally, totally done.

46:38.958 --> 46:40.416
I mean, we went out for two years,

46:40.500 --> 46:42.708
but by the end of which,
we pretty much hated each other.

46:42.791 --> 46:44.208
So you're saying you hate her now, eh?

46:44.750 --> 46:47.083
-"Hate" is a strong word.
-You just said it.

46:47.166 --> 46:49.083
But definitely dislike.

46:49.666 --> 46:50.583
You be careful, mate.

46:50.666 --> 46:53.000
'Cause that's my future fiancée
you're talking about.

46:53.125 --> 46:55.083
-Really?
-What do you mean, "really?"

46:56.041 --> 46:58.708
Oh, what? Because I haven't got that?
Yeah?

46:59.083 --> 47:02.375
I couldn't fill those boots? Huh? What?
What went through your mind just then?

47:02.458 --> 47:04.000
"Oh, this guy in front of me

47:04.083 --> 47:06.541
has got a really tiny, weird penis
that everyone's laughing at."

47:06.625 --> 47:08.041
No, they're not. They're laughing at you.

47:08.125 --> 47:10.625
'Cause you're the weirdo
who's walking around with your big penis.

47:10.708 --> 47:13.625
"Oh, look at me!
I'm at a wedding with a big dick!

47:13.708 --> 47:15.875
Everyone respect me
because of my big penis!

47:15.958 --> 47:18.333
Ooh! Oh, it's really girthy!
It's really girthy!

47:18.416 --> 47:20.125
Please like it! Please like it!"

47:23.041 --> 47:25.416
-I'm sorry, you completely lost me.
-Exactly.

47:25.750 --> 47:27.125
Stay away from her.

47:28.333 --> 47:29.500
-Okay.
-Good.

47:29.583 --> 47:30.666
-I will.
-Okay.

47:31.416 --> 47:32.500
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

47:32.583 --> 47:34.500
-Good chat.
-Yeah, great chat.

47:34.583 --> 47:36.333
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

47:37.041 --> 47:38.416
-All right.
-Yeah.

47:40.916 --> 47:42.041
Hey.

47:43.125 --> 47:45.458
-Hey, you.
-Is everything okay?

47:45.541 --> 47:46.500
[chuckles]

47:46.833 --> 47:48.083
Uh, yeah, yeah.

47:49.333 --> 47:51.833
-[Dina] Do you want a drink?
-[Jack] Yeah, no, I really do.

47:51.916 --> 47:54.333
I think I might change out the wine
and go for a gin and...

47:54.583 --> 47:55.458
[Jack] Fuck.

47:56.041 --> 47:56.916
One sec.

48:00.041 --> 48:02.083
He wants a Gin and Fuck, please. Thanks.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.125
I'm kidding. [chuckles]

48:13.166 --> 48:14.458
[Marc] What are you doing?

48:14.541 --> 48:15.583
-[Jack] Just here.
-Ow!

48:15.666 --> 48:16.833
I'm so sorry.

48:16.916 --> 48:18.125
Sorry. Sorry.

48:18.375 --> 48:20.958
Um... Why... No, okay.

48:21.041 --> 48:23.375
Just hold on one sec.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.041
Sorry.

48:25.125 --> 48:27.083
I know you have this thing
for Hayley, right,

48:27.166 --> 48:29.958
but she doesn't feel the same,
so you need to accept that.

48:30.041 --> 48:31.666
Oh, oh, oh. Is that right?

48:31.750 --> 48:33.208
Then, um... hmm...

48:33.291 --> 48:36.125
how come we shagged three weeks ago?

48:41.500 --> 48:42.875
-What?
-That's right.

48:43.625 --> 48:45.916
Shagged.

48:46.291 --> 48:47.541
Just... [laughs]

48:48.000 --> 48:50.708
Okay, I really-- I really don't know
what's happening here,

48:50.791 --> 48:52.166
but I do know that she's happy.

48:52.375 --> 48:53.250
[Jack sighs]

48:53.333 --> 48:55.416
Please, please don't ruin that.

48:55.500 --> 48:56.625
Okay, okay.

48:56.708 --> 48:58.875
But I'm gonna make her happy! Idiot!

48:58.958 --> 49:01.041
[Jack grunts] No, okay...

49:01.666 --> 49:02.791
Okay, okay...

49:03.291 --> 49:04.458
Oh, God, this is happening!

49:04.541 --> 49:07.041
-[Jack] I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
-[muffled yelling]

49:08.291 --> 49:11.000
-Ah, now, Jack...
-Sidney!

49:11.083 --> 49:13.625
I'm gonna nip back to the hotel,
put some trousers on.

49:13.708 --> 49:15.291
-The kilt's too much.
-Brilliant! Great!

49:15.375 --> 49:17.875
Could you just give me
a hand for just one second? Sidney!

49:17.958 --> 49:19.708
-Sidney!
-Yes. Yes, Jack.

49:19.791 --> 49:21.333
-Sidney!
-Yes, I'm coming.

49:22.041 --> 49:24.041
-I need to find a room.
-Yeah, what's going on?

49:24.125 --> 49:25.458
I'll explain it later.

49:26.208 --> 49:28.583
-I'm Federico Vitelli.
-Dina.

49:28.666 --> 49:30.500
-Dina, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

49:31.125 --> 49:32.000
I love your work.

49:32.375 --> 49:33.291

49:33.375 --> 49:35.416

-Sidney?
-Yes?

49:37.083 --> 49:37.916
-That cupboard!
-Yes.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.708
-The other door, Sidney!
-Both doors?

49:39.791 --> 49:41.291
There we go. Okay.

49:42.208 --> 49:43.166
Wowzers!

49:43.250 --> 49:45.333
-Please don't put me in the cupboard!
-Bye-bye!

49:45.416 --> 49:47.125
-[straining]
-I think Jim has that painting.

49:47.208 --> 49:49.250
-Yeah!
-Lovely stuff.

49:49.875 --> 49:52.333
[Marc] Please! Help!

50:00.708 --> 50:02.041
Uh, yeah, sure.

50:02.208 --> 50:03.708
Um, sorry.

50:04.250 --> 50:05.166
[in Italian] Sorry.

50:06.166 --> 50:07.083
Jack?

50:09.125 --> 50:10.083
All right.

50:10.375 --> 50:11.875
I want an answer, and I want it now.

50:12.125 --> 50:13.541
About what, Chaz?

50:13.625 --> 50:15.083
Just the whole marriage thing.

50:15.166 --> 50:17.666
Look, is it because of your ex-boyfriend?
Is that the issue?

50:17.750 --> 50:19.500
Oh, God! Don't be ridiculous!

50:20.166 --> 50:21.583
All right, good, 'cause, um...

50:21.958 --> 50:23.208
he said he hated you, so...

50:24.583 --> 50:25.500
[Chaz] Mmm.

50:27.458 --> 50:28.375
That's good stuff.

50:31.333 --> 50:32.166
He what?

50:36.333 --> 50:37.416
[muffled yelling]

50:37.500 --> 50:38.375
[Marc] Help me!

50:38.458 --> 50:39.833
I'm in the cupboard!

Hello!

[pounding on cupboard door]

50:45.458 --> 50:46.833
[coughing]

50:52.083 --> 50:52.916
What?

50:53.583 --> 50:56.041
So, I just heard something
a little bit weird.

50:56.375 --> 50:59.583
Apparently, you shagged
Marc Fisher three weeks ago.

51:01.208 --> 51:02.125
Did he say that?

51:02.791 --> 51:05.250
You know, that really is unbelievable.
I mean, the nerve!

51:05.333 --> 51:08.083
My God! You are the worst liar
in the entire world!

51:08.166 --> 51:09.375
What were you thinking?

51:09.458 --> 51:12.208
I know, I really fucked up.
It was an accident.

51:12.916 --> 51:14.333
-[woman] Hello!
-Hello.

51:15.166 --> 51:16.291
[Hayley and Jack chuckle]

51:17.708 --> 51:19.958
How the hell do you have sex
with someone by accident?

51:20.041 --> 51:20.916
How does that happen?

51:21.000 --> 51:22.541
Shh. Please. Let me explain.

51:22.625 --> 51:24.583
You know when I came to London
a couple weeks ago,

51:24.666 --> 51:26.291
and I was really fucking stressed
about the wedding?

51:26.375 --> 51:28.375
I went to the pub,
and I had a couple of drinks,

51:28.458 --> 51:30.125
and who walks in but Marc Fisher.

51:30.208 --> 51:32.041
We start chatting,
we had a couple of shots,

51:32.125 --> 51:34.458
and before we know it,
one thing leads to another, all right?

51:34.541 --> 51:36.291
But it didn't mean anything, Jack.

51:36.750 --> 51:40.458
Of course, it turns out that he's been
obsessed with me since we were 15.

51:40.541 --> 51:43.125
Fifteen, Jack, and nothing ever happened.

51:43.208 --> 51:45.958
Yeah, we snogged a couple of times.
Maybe he felt my tits. I don't know.

51:46.041 --> 51:48.791
-Maybe I rubbed him up against his jeans.
-I don't need the details.

51:48.875 --> 51:49.708
Sorry.

51:50.625 --> 51:52.708
Jesus, Hayley.
I thought you loved Roberto.

51:52.791 --> 51:54.791
Oh, my God. I do.

51:55.208 --> 51:57.000
I do. More than anything.

51:57.958 --> 51:59.500
He can never find out.

52:00.041 --> 52:01.208
It would kill him.

I fancy him a bit, but...

53:47.250 --> 53:48.625
I'm not even gay, but...

[Bryan] Mm.

53:53.416 --> 53:55.750
I wish he'd give me a part
in one of his films, though.

Dina?

Jack. Hi. I was looking for you.

56:12.041 --> 56:13.916
-You're not going, are you?
-I know. I'm so sorry.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.583
I was trying to say goodbye.
There's been this hurricane in Mexico.

56:16.666 --> 56:18.583
I gotta get back 'cause
my editor has food poisoning.

56:18.666 --> 56:20.333
It's a long story, but I'm so sorry.

56:20.416 --> 56:23.458
But maybe we can
get together another time or...

56:23.541 --> 56:26.916
Will you be in Mexico
or Guadalajara anytime soon?

56:27.000 --> 56:29.250

-What?

56:36.791 --> 56:39.041
-Chaz just told me you hate me.
-I didn't say "hate."

56:39.125 --> 56:40.166
Well, you did say, so...

56:40.250 --> 56:43.541
[stammers] Okay, no, I did say "hate,"

56:43.625 --> 56:44.916
but then I changed it.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.083
Yeah, to "dislike."

56:46.166 --> 56:49.708
-Aww, that's so sweet of you, Jack.
-You don't like me either!

56:49.791 --> 56:53.291
Why do we have to pretend our relationship
was anything other than the misery it was?

56:57.375 --> 57:00.000
-Right?
-Okay. Yeah, okay.

57:00.125 --> 57:02.458
-I guess you make a fair point.

57:15.166 --> 57:16.833
Yeah, I don't know if I...

1:03:28.625 --> 1:03:31.250
I just wanted to check to see
if you guys were good. You good?

1:03:31.750 --> 1:03:32.708
Good? Uh...

1:03:33.500 --> 1:03:35.583
Yeah, I can-- I'm gonna find--
I'm just gonna--

1:03:35.666 --> 1:03:37.500
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna find something...

[Dina] Um...

1:04:05.833 --> 1:04:06.916
Great. Thank you. Could I--

1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:08.666
Could I also grab, um...

1:04:09.291 --> 1:04:10.416
some coffees?

1:04:10.875 --> 1:04:12.166
-[Jack] Thanks.
-I have no idea.

1:04:17.958 --> 1:04:19.458
Look, I'd wish you'd never...

1:04:19.541 --> 1:04:21.041
Can we just pretend that,

1:04:21.125 --> 1:04:23.166
you know, whatever you saw back there
never happened?

1:04:23.916 --> 1:04:25.541
It's a pretty enduring image.

1:04:25.625 --> 1:04:27.166
Kind of hard to forget.

1:04:27.250 --> 1:04:28.083
[Dina chuckles]

1:04:28.166 --> 1:04:29.916
Right. Uh, no.

1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:31.583
There's-- There's a totally...

1:04:32.333 --> 1:04:34.291
totally reasonable explanation for that.

1:04:34.375 --> 1:04:35.333
It's a funny story.

1:04:35.625 --> 1:04:37.291
Really. Very funny.

1:04:38.041 --> 1:04:41.416
And I will tell you about it,
just not today.

1:04:41.750 --> 1:04:43.875
Could we just try to forget it?

1:04:48.125 --> 1:04:49.250
Yeah, I can try.

1:04:49.333 --> 1:04:50.500
-Good, good.
-Okay.

1:04:50.833 --> 1:04:52.333
That was-- It was weird. It was weird.

1:04:52.708 --> 1:04:54.208
Yeah. I know.

1:04:54.291 --> 1:04:55.833
-But...
-I'm sorry. So, come on.

1:04:55.916 --> 1:04:58.625
[stammers] You were about to tell me...

1:04:59.416 --> 1:05:01.625
what you've been up to
since I last saw you.

1:05:01.708 --> 1:05:04.875
Okay, well, I guess the main thing
has been work. Uh...

1:05:04.958 --> 1:05:06.833
You know, it's taken everything.

1:05:07.291 --> 1:05:10.958
Honestly. I mean, I only really
stopped and looked up

1:05:11.041 --> 1:05:12.208
when my mom got sick.

1:05:16.458 --> 1:05:18.708
Is my mom's terminal cancer boring you?

1:05:18.791 --> 1:05:21.000
No. No, it's not.

1:05:22.083 --> 1:05:22.916
Carry on.

1:05:23.541 --> 1:05:24.583
-You sure?
-Yeah.

1:05:24.708 --> 1:05:25.583
[chuckles]

1:05:25.833 --> 1:05:26.666
Okay.

1:05:27.750 --> 1:05:28.583
Um...

1:05:32.583 --> 1:05:33.416
You know, I...

1:05:33.500 --> 1:05:37.875
I had-- I know told you how
she and I were really close, and, um...

1:05:38.083 --> 1:05:39.000
Hm.

1:05:39.416 --> 1:05:40.583
Well, you know, it just...

1:05:42.375 --> 1:05:44.458
You know, the whole thing was just

1:05:44.541 --> 1:05:47.083
a really huge punch to the gut, honestly.

1:05:49.541 --> 1:05:50.916
-[Jack yawns]
-[Dina] Uh...

1:05:54.416 --> 1:05:57.750
The truth is, I just can't get over
the randomness of it, you know?

1:05:59.916 --> 1:06:00.791
Like, why her?

1:06:02.708 --> 1:06:03.625
Yeah, why?

1:06:03.708 --> 1:06:04.750
You know, I don't, um...

1:06:05.791 --> 1:06:07.208
[voice breaking] I don't normally...

1:06:08.125 --> 1:06:11.375
talk to people about this
because it just feels really weird, but...

1:06:11.458 --> 1:06:12.333
Mm-hmm?

1:06:14.083 --> 1:06:16.041
[Dina] You know,
I'm really devastated by it.

1:06:19.291 --> 1:06:21.375
I don't really think I'm over it, and I...

1:06:24.125 --> 1:06:27.500
The truth is, I don't think I'll ever
really be over it, you know?

-What?

1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:09.583
Maddie Richards never had any complaints
about me in the bedroom.

1:07:09.666 --> 1:07:12.625
She always said I was
a solid 7,5 out of 10.

1:07:13.125 --> 1:07:15.500
And most of the time,
I didn't even have a full erection,

1:07:15.583 --> 1:07:17.208
so imagine what you're getting.

1:07:20.791 --> 1:07:22.125

-You're not.

such a big deal?

And Roberto is gonna leave me!
And I deserve it!

1:12:37.416 --> 1:12:39.583
Because I fuck everything up!

-No, you don't.
-Yes, I do! Yes!

1:12:41.541 --> 1:12:43.708

You are not a loser.

1:12:47.625 --> 1:12:48.458
All right?

1:12:49.041 --> 1:12:50.666
You are my sister.

1:12:52.750 --> 1:12:56.125
And you're the funniest, most brilliant,
most caring person in the world.

1:12:56.208 --> 1:13:00.583
And if it turns out that Roberto can't
forgive you for a really stupid mistake--

1:13:00.666 --> 1:13:03.125
-Oh, Jack!
-But-- No, listen, listen, listen.

1:13:03.208 --> 1:13:05.625
If he can't--
Look, if he can't forgive you...

1:13:08.750 --> 1:13:09.750
I'll still be here.

1:13:13.708 --> 1:13:15.000
I'll always be around.

1:14:20.791 --> 1:14:21.750
Jim and Jeff?

1:14:21.833 --> 1:14:23.750
An old laptop. It's not my main laptop.

1:14:25.416 --> 1:14:27.166
Jim and Jeff sound like assholes.

1:14:28.541 --> 1:14:29.625
An old laptop.

1:14:30.333 --> 1:14:32.416
-Oh, my God, I have to tell you something.
-Mm-hmm?

1:14:32.500 --> 1:14:34.625
-They're not your friends. Cheers.
-Cheers.

1:14:38.083 --> 1:14:39.916
-You drink that?
-I am drinking this.

1:14:41.708 --> 1:14:43.125
Oh, God, I need bread.

1:15:01.541 --> 1:15:02.375
[Rebecca] Hello!

1:15:03.416 --> 1:15:05.541
A vision in navy. [chuckles]

1:15:05.625 --> 1:15:07.875

1:15:07.958 --> 1:15:08.791
[clears throat]

1:15:08.875 --> 1:15:10.041
-Rebecca?
-Yes?

1:15:10.750 --> 1:15:11.750
Why do you like me?

1:15:12.375 --> 1:15:13.291
I...

1:15:13.458 --> 1:15:17.250
I mean, I'm a totally self-obsessed,
neurotic mess.

1:15:18.250 --> 1:15:21.041
Yeah. Yeah. But I'm... I'm...

1:15:21.625 --> 1:15:24.583
I suppose I don't really mind
those-- those things about you.

1:15:25.583 --> 1:15:27.416
But don't you think I'm a bit of an idiot?

1:15:28.333 --> 1:15:29.458
Oh, yeah.

1:15:29.541 --> 1:15:30.375
Yeah.

1:15:30.458 --> 1:15:32.333
I mean, you're a massive idiot. Yeah.

1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:34.625
-Yeah.
-Well, yeah.

1:15:36.541 --> 1:15:38.666
But I suppose there's one or two people

1:15:38.750 --> 1:15:42.458
who would say that I am
a bit of a massive idiot.

1:15:44.250 --> 1:15:46.958
And so you being
a massive idiot is sort of

1:15:47.041 --> 1:15:50.625
what I actually like the best about you.

1:15:53.250 --> 1:15:56.458
I suppose what I'm saying is
that I just like you for being you.

1:15:57.416 --> 1:15:58.291
[chuckles]

1:15:58.708 --> 1:15:59.583
Oh, wow.

1:16:00.916 --> 1:16:01.750
That's...

1:16:02.166 --> 1:16:03.166
It's...

1:16:03.958 --> 1:16:07.000
I don't think anybody's ever
liked me for being me before.

1:16:07.083 --> 1:16:09.500
They usually like me
for who I pretend to be.

1:16:10.083 --> 1:16:11.083
Like, occasionally.

1:16:13.666 --> 1:16:14.500
Well...

1:16:16.166 --> 1:16:18.125
with me you don't have to pretend.

1:16:37.208 --> 1:16:38.041
Oh.

1:16:42.583 --> 1:16:43.500
Um...

1:16:44.208 --> 1:16:45.041
Thank you.

1:16:45.125 --> 1:16:46.333
No, thank you.

1:16:48.125 --> 1:16:50.041
-Sorry, that was-- I didn't know this--
-No.

1:16:50.125 --> 1:16:51.750
-No, I don't--
-I just, I--

1:16:51.833 --> 1:16:53.125
I-- I definitely didn't.

1:16:54.208 --> 1:16:55.375
'Cause it's, uh...

1:16:56.583 --> 1:16:57.833
I'm-- Would you mind if--

1:16:57.916 --> 1:16:59.541
-If we did just one more?
-That'd be good.

1:16:59.625 --> 1:17:00.833
-Yeah? [laughs]
-Yeah.

1:17:13.666 --> 1:17:14.500
She's yours.

1:17:15.666 --> 1:17:16.500
[exhales sharply]

1:17:20.250 --> 1:17:21.375
-Marc!
-What do you want?

1:17:21.458 --> 1:17:24.166
-I just want to talk to you.
-Well, there's nothing to talk about.

1:17:24.250 --> 1:17:26.208
Marc, please, please, please, please.

1:17:26.291 --> 1:17:28.375
Just... Just-- Just listen.

1:17:28.458 --> 1:17:30.833
I know how you feel about Hayley.

1:17:31.750 --> 1:17:34.958
But maybe some things
just aren't meant to be.

1:17:35.041 --> 1:17:36.375
-Not this.
-Just...

1:17:38.333 --> 1:17:40.833
What I do know is that Hayley
deserves to be happy.

1:17:40.916 --> 1:17:41.750
Yeah.

1:17:44.083 --> 1:17:46.041
But she's happy with Roberto.

1:17:48.125 --> 1:17:49.166
[sighs] If you...

1:17:50.333 --> 1:17:54.541
If you really, truly care about her,
please let her go.

1:18:02.708 --> 1:18:04.458
[sighs]

1:18:10.791 --> 1:18:12.541
Okay. Okay.

1:18:26.375 --> 1:18:27.333
Jack.

1:18:27.416 --> 1:18:28.250
Sidney...

1:18:29.208 --> 1:18:32.416
-I'm really not on my best right now.
-You see, Jack, you're good with ladies,

1:18:32.500 --> 1:18:34.666
and I was wondering
if you had any pointers.

1:18:35.333 --> 1:18:41.458
Believe me, I'm not the best person
to ask for advice about anything.

1:18:41.541 --> 1:18:43.125
-Yes, you are, Jack.
-Not right now.

1:18:43.541 --> 1:18:46.250
Now, I know I'm not as sexy as...

1:18:47.125 --> 1:18:47.958
Brad Pitt.

1:18:53.625 --> 1:18:55.833
But now I'm starting to worry
that I might be...

1:18:57.166 --> 1:18:59.041
I'm probably overthinking it, but...

1:19:00.583 --> 1:19:01.666
Well, am I boring?

1:19:02.666 --> 1:19:03.791
[snoring]

1:19:03.875 --> 1:19:04.708
Jack?

1:19:10.250 --> 1:19:11.083
Jack?

1:19:15.041 --> 1:19:16.208
[snoring]

1:19:21.958 --> 1:19:24.208
-Sidney? Sidney, Sidney.
-Yes? Sorry, Jack.

1:19:24.875 --> 1:19:25.750
Go on.

1:19:26.458 --> 1:19:27.416
Look.

1:19:27.833 --> 1:19:31.208
-Try to listen more--
-Yes. Because you're good at that.

1:19:31.291 --> 1:19:32.333
-No.
-You're--

1:19:32.416 --> 1:19:33.375
Yes.

1:19:33.458 --> 1:19:35.333
-Try to--
-You let people have their say.

1:19:36.166 --> 1:19:37.583
-Sidney--
-You create a vibe.

1:19:37.666 --> 1:19:38.916
You create a vibe.

1:19:41.833 --> 1:19:44.958
Just listen more to people.

1:19:45.375 --> 1:19:47.458
And I know they're your friends,
all right, but...

1:19:49.250 --> 1:19:50.708
stop going on about Jim and Jeff.

1:19:50.791 --> 1:19:51.750
[chuckles]

1:19:53.250 --> 1:19:54.708
I don't know them that well.

1:19:58.416 --> 1:20:00.083
Then why do you go on about them?

1:20:01.416 --> 1:20:03.791
I suppose to make myself
sound more popular.

1:20:04.708 --> 1:20:05.708
It's not working.

1:20:07.750 --> 1:20:08.625
No.

1:20:11.875 --> 1:20:13.500
-No?
-[whispers] No.

1:20:14.291 --> 1:20:16.000
-Definitely not?
-It's--

1:20:16.083 --> 1:20:17.583
Stop talking about Jim and Jeff.

1:20:18.083 --> 1:20:19.041
And for heaven's sake...

1:20:20.166 --> 1:20:21.000
listen.

1:20:22.333 --> 1:20:23.166
Good luck.

1:20:24.416 --> 1:20:25.541
-Onwards.
-Yeah.

ladies and gentlemen,

1:20:45.958 --> 1:20:49.041
now we'll have the speech
of the maid of honor, Bryan.

1:20:50.333 --> 1:20:52.041
-Where are you going?
-Shit, that's me.

1:20:52.125 --> 1:20:53.166
That's you. That's you.

1:20:53.583 --> 1:20:54.416
Hey! [laughs]

1:21:08.250 --> 1:21:09.250

1:21:13.916 --> 1:21:14.791
Hello, everyone.

1:21:15.500 --> 1:21:16.416
Uh...

1:21:16.958 --> 1:21:19.125
Apologies for my lack of Italian.

1:21:19.250 --> 1:21:20.166
Um...

1:21:27.375 --> 1:21:28.208
[Bryan] Um...

1:21:31.333 --> 1:21:33.000
Love is a weird thing, isn't it?

1:21:34.333 --> 1:21:36.291
It's unpredictable sometimes...

1:21:37.625 --> 1:21:38.541
confusing.

1:21:40.583 --> 1:21:41.625
But I think...

1:21:42.416 --> 1:21:43.958
the most important thing...

1:21:46.166 --> 1:21:47.708
is that the person you're with...

1:21:48.750 --> 1:21:50.500
loves you for being you.

1:21:51.541 --> 1:21:52.583
[Bryan] You are enough.

1:21:53.541 --> 1:21:55.458
And you love them just for being them.

1:21:55.875 --> 1:21:57.958
And that's what Hayley and Roberto have.

1:22:01.958 --> 1:22:03.583
And that's what I have with Rebecca.

1:22:06.375 --> 1:22:08.125
I am-- I am so sorry. My God.

1:22:12.291 --> 1:22:14.708
I love you to bits, Hayles, and...

1:22:15.041 --> 1:22:18.416
I'm so glad you're happy.

1:22:19.500 --> 1:22:22.125
And I hope it lasts forever.

1:22:42.375 --> 1:22:43.625
[stammers] Was that okay?

1:22:43.708 --> 1:22:44.583
Mm.

1:22:44.958 --> 1:22:46.958
I thought it was brilliant.
You were very good.

1:22:48.166 --> 1:22:50.916
-Um, I'll just get another drink.
-Yeah, yeah.

We...

1:25:33.208 --> 1:25:34.541
Maybe we shouldn't get married.

'Cause, I mean...

you're clearly not in love with me, and...

1:25:41.875 --> 1:25:44.000
that wouldn't really work, would it?

No, here your watermelons
have way too many seeds.

That's where you're wrong.

1:26:33.541 --> 1:26:34.458
You're wrong.

1:26:34.541 --> 1:26:36.250
Okay, in America, we don't do seeds.

1:26:36.333 --> 1:26:38.083
You know, we just make 'em
without the seeds.

-Hello.

-I'm in car insurance.

Oh.

Not as dry as it sounds.

Tell me about yourself.

-Yeah, in Rome.
-You're joking me. Wow. In Rome?

1:27:15.208 --> 1:27:17.041
-And I have one friend.
-Very exotic. Go on.

-She works with me. Julia.
-Julia?

-Julia.
-Keep talking.

-Yeah, she's a very crazy woman.
-Mad lady.

1:29:20.625 --> 1:29:21.458
I...

1:29:22.375 --> 1:29:25.083
I just felt that there was something
special between us.

1:29:25.958 --> 1:29:28.125
And, um, I know this seems nuts

1:29:28.208 --> 1:29:31.500
'cause we'd only known each other
a couple of days, but I...

1:29:33.208 --> 1:29:36.041
I've never felt a connection
like that before.

1:29:38.166 --> 1:29:39.125
Or since.

1:29:41.250 --> 1:29:43.750
And I had a feeling you felt the same.

1:29:48.125 --> 1:29:49.083
So I just want to--

1:29:49.166 --> 1:29:51.000
I just need to know, uh...

1:29:51.916 --> 1:29:53.041
if I was imagining it.

You weren't imagining it.

1:30:02.083 --> 1:30:03.875

I don't know how that happened.

I'm sorry, man.

-Really?
-Yeah.

1:31:21.583 --> 1:31:25.083
I've realized that I don't need to act.
I'm fine just being me.

1:31:27.291 --> 1:31:28.625
So that's it. Just...

1:31:28.708 --> 1:31:29.583
That's it.

1:31:30.625 --> 1:31:32.208
Done. No more.

-Hey.

1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:43.250
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

1:31:43.333 --> 1:31:44.583
[Bryan] Thank you very much.

-You're Hayley's actor friend?
-Yes, I am.

1:31:47.458 --> 1:31:49.083
I'm doing my new film.

1:31:49.166 --> 1:31:50.416
Why don't you take my card

1:31:50.500 --> 1:31:52.916
and give my assistant a call tomorrow?

1:31:53.000 --> 1:31:54.208
-Yeah.
-We'll have a coffee.

1:31:54.291 --> 1:31:55.875

-That was incredible. What just happened?
-I don't know.

1:32:04.125 --> 1:32:06.666
I thought you were quitting acting.

1:32:06.750 --> 1:32:08.916
No, that's bullshit. I'm all about acting.

We're all lucky.

1:32:16.083 --> 1:32:17.166
Are we really?

1:32:20.041 --> 1:32:23.916
Have you ever thought
about how small the chances are

1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:25.166
that you would be born?

1:32:26.541 --> 1:32:28.708

hadn't crossed paths
at the exact moment they did,

1:32:35.416 --> 1:32:36.666
then you wouldn't exist.

You'd never have even lived a single day.

-Did you just make that up?
-No.

1:32:44.708 --> 1:32:47.625
It's a quote from one of Vitelli's films.
But it's true, though, right?

1:32:47.708 --> 1:32:48.541
Yeah.

1:32:49.291 --> 1:32:51.375
I mean, it's pretty scary,

1:32:52.041 --> 1:32:53.666
but if we're honest with ourselves,

1:32:53.750 --> 1:32:55.416
then it all comes down to chance.

1:32:56.041 --> 1:33:00.000
And I guess life is about grabbing
those chances when they come 'round.
