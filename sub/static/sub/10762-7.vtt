WEBVTT

00:08.074 --> 00:10.076
I suppose you looked
in the classifieds

00:10.076 --> 00:11.578
under "housekeepers."
Check.

00:11.578 --> 00:13.046
And you asked people
in your building?
Check.

00:13.446 --> 00:15.248
And you called
the employment agencies?

00:15.248 --> 00:16.315
Again, check.

00:16.315 --> 00:17.784
I heard you
the first time.

00:19.819 --> 00:21.121
Well...

00:21.388 --> 00:22.455
Who'd have thought
it'd be so hard

00:22.956 --> 00:24.457
to get someone
to clean your house?
Well..
.

00:24.457 --> 00:26.960
over the years
Daphne has managed to scour

00:26.960 --> 00:29.462
her way into our heart,
so to speak.

00:29.462 --> 00:31.898
Just don't want to hire somebo
who's in it for only the money
.

00:32.298 --> 00:34.367
So you want to find someone
who's in it

00:34.868 --> 00:36.169
for the joy of cleaning?

00:36.403 --> 00:38.471
Ah. May I?

00:38.471 --> 00:39.472
Oh, of course, Gil.

00:39.472 --> 00:40.473
Take a load off.

00:40.473 --> 00:41.474
Nice outfit, Roz.

00:41.975 --> 00:44.244
Somehow, you and a peasant
blouse just go together.

00:44.477 --> 00:45.945
Thanks.

00:46.279 --> 00:47.847
Haven't worn it
for years.

00:47.847 --> 00:50.817
But how long can something
stay in the closet?

00:55.388 --> 00:57.457
Say, uh, Gil...

00:57.957 --> 00:59.759
uh, are you pleased
with your housekeeper?

00:59.959 --> 01:00.493
Oh, you mean Chung?

01:01.027 --> 01:02.028
Oh, yes, he's marvelous.

01:02.462 --> 01:03.997
He's efficient,
he's dependable,

01:03.997 --> 01:06.499
and he still hasn't figured out American money.

01:06.499 --> 01:08.001
Between you and me,
I told him

01:08.001 --> 01:10.904
when they made Lincoln's picture bigger,
it was worth more.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.305
(chuckles)

01:12.305 --> 01:13.807
Very funny.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.809
Do you suppose that
your man Friday

01:15.809 --> 01:18.244
might be available
on a Monday or Tuesday?

01:18.244 --> 01:20.180
You want to steal my Chung?
No, no

01:20.180 --> 01:21.681
Not-Not steal him.

01:21.681 --> 01:23.683
Just borrow him for
a day or two a week

01:23.683 --> 01:25.185
until I can restaff.

01:25.185 --> 01:26.519
A dangerous notion,
Frasier.

01:26.786 --> 01:29.189
You know how employees gossip
about their benefactors.

01:29.456 --> 01:30.457
Well, I have nothing to hide.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.859
Yes, but suppose
while on your premises

01:32.859 --> 01:34.828
he lets something slip
about me and Deb

01:34.828 --> 01:36.296
and our heart-shaped bed?

01:36.663 --> 01:40.133
I would refuse to believe him.

01:40.467 --> 01:42.969
Did I mention he's a drug mule
?

01:43.336 --> 01:44.871
Oh, he is not.
You're just saying that

01:44.871 --> 01:46.406
'cause you don't want
to help me out.

01:46.806 --> 01:47.874
Such insight.

01:47.874 --> 01:50.376
It's a pity more people
don't listen to your show.

01:57.550 --> 01:59.052
several other candidates
to interview,

01:59.052 --> 02:02.055
but I'll be sure to let you know
by the 12th.

02:03.556 --> 02:05.058
Of never!

02:08.294 --> 02:09.963
Honestly, I'm beginning
to wonder

02:09.963 --> 02:12.298
if we'll ever find anyone that meets our standards.

02:12.599 --> 02:13.666
You're being too picky.

02:13.666 --> 02:15.468
It's just housekeeping,
not rocket science.

02:15.702 --> 02:17.070
DAPHNE:
I beg to differ.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.371
You don't even know half

02:18.371 --> 02:20.373
of what I used to do
around here.

02:20.373 --> 02:23.676
Like dusting the plant leaves
or rotating your underwear.

02:25.411 --> 02:26.346
Excuse me?

02:26.646 --> 02:29.215
Every month, I used
to throw out your
oldest pair

02:29.215 --> 02:30.183
and put in two
new pairs.

02:30.583 --> 02:33.119
Did it ever occur to you
that you never had

02:33.119 --> 02:34.988
to buy underwear
in ten years?

02:38.324 --> 02:41.194
I thought I got hold
of a good batch.

02:42.562 --> 02:43.463
FRASIER:
Well, let's see.

02:43.763 --> 02:45.231
Who is our front-runner,
thus far?

02:45.598 --> 02:46.666
(wearily):
Oh, I don't know. I...

02:46.666 --> 02:48.001
.
They're all the same to me

02:48.301 --> 02:50.370
Honestly, Dad, you know,
I am starting to get

02:50.370 --> 02:52.272
the slightest bit chapped
with your attitude.

02:52.272 --> 02:54.641
You haven't even graded
any of the candidates.

02:54.641 --> 02:56.142
You've simply doodled
a warplane

02:56.142 --> 02:58.144
dropping bombs
on a soldier.

02:58.144 --> 02:59.646
(doorbell rings)
That's not a soldier.

02:59.646 --> 03:01.648
Well, then why is he
wearing a helmet?

03:01.648 --> 03:02.515
That's not a helmet.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.418
It's someone with a big head

03:10.190 --> 03:11.191
Yes?

03:11.191 --> 03:12.192
Hi, I'm Trish Haney.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.693
I'm here about the housekeeper job.

03:13.693 --> 03:14.527
I'm really sorry I'm late.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.430
I had you down
for over an hour ago.

03:17.430 --> 03:19.866
I know. I got stuck in line
waiting to buy tickets

03:19.866 --> 03:20.768
for the Sonics game
this weekend.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.203
Really? Come on in.

03:23.503 --> 03:25.038
I should have guessed
everyone and his brother

03:25.538 --> 03:26.873
would want to see
Vince Carter play.

03:26.873 --> 03:30.109
Not everybody... or his brother.

03:30.109 --> 03:33.546
Wow, this is
a beautiful place.

03:34.047 --> 03:34.514
Here's my resume.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.549
Ah, thank you.
Won't you be seated?

03:36.549 --> 03:37.550
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

03:37.550 --> 03:38.551
This is my father,
Martin Crane,

03:39.052 --> 03:40.520
and this is my sister-in-law,
Daphne Crane.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.455
Now, I'll get right
to the interview.

03:42.822 --> 03:44.891
First question:

03:44.891 --> 03:46.826
What is the best way

03:47.160 --> 03:50.196
to combat rings
on a wooden table?

03:50.196 --> 03:51.698
Um...

03:51.698 --> 03:54.701
I've heard
you can rub mayonnaise on it.

03:55.034 --> 03:58.404
The best way is to
provide coasters.

03:58.671 --> 04:01.241
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.242
(laughs)

04:02.242 --> 04:05.078
Started me out with
a trick question, right?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.779
So how do you think
the Sonics will defend Carter?

04:07.080 --> 04:08.648
Um, you have to have someone
body up on him

04:08.648 --> 04:10.583
and then double-team
when he gets the ball.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.086
Thank you.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.322
DAPHNE
: Trish...

04:16.689 --> 04:19.259
if the washing machine
has a 25-minute cycle

04:19.759 --> 04:21.761
and the dryer
has a 40-minute cycle

04:21.761 --> 04:24.530
what time does the second load
have to go in the washer

04:24.731 --> 04:27.300
to be dry by 5:00?

04:27.300 --> 04:31.204
Uh, well, that's 65 minutes, so 3:55.

04:31.537 --> 04:32.605
You may want to take some time

04:32.605 --> 04:33.606
to think about these questions be...

04:33.606 --> 04:34.607
FRASIER:
Daphne...

04:35.041 --> 04:36.542
she's right.

04:37.977 --> 04:40.947
Well done.

04:41.347 --> 04:42.415
Hey, I got a question.

04:42.415 --> 04:43.750
Can you clean a house?

04:44.017 --> 04:46.085
Yes. And if I do say so myself,
I'm pretty good.

04:46.586 --> 04:47.353
Next question:

04:47.553 --> 04:48.955
Can you start Monday?

04:49.188 --> 04:50.256
(chuckles)

04:50.256 --> 04:53.259
You know, we're getting just a bit
ahead of ourselves

04:53.760 --> 04:55.261
We still have
several people to meet.

04:55.762 --> 04:57.764
Uh, thank you for coming by.
Oh, sure.

04:57.764 --> 04:59.265
That was the interview, huh?
Two questions?

04:59.265 --> 05:01.267
Well, it was really more
of a pre-screening.

05:01.267 --> 05:02.769
We'll be sure
to let you know.

05:02.769 --> 05:03.770
Okay, thanks.
Just so you know

05:03.770 --> 05:05.271
I'll be out of town
till the first.

05:05.271 --> 05:08.274
...
Fine. Then I'll be sure to call you the second

05:09.776 --> 05:12.979
I lose my mind.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.315
What? What was wrong with her?

05:15.315 --> 05:16.649
In the first place,

05:16.916 --> 05:17.984
she showed up late.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.485
If she doesn't take
the interview seriously

05:19.485 --> 05:20.987
how can we expect her
to take the job seriously?

05:21.387 --> 05:23.723
Ah, you just don't like her
because she's not all stuffy

05:23.956 --> 05:25.525
She did seem a bit cheeky.

05:25.525 --> 05:29.329
Which you never were.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.632
Well, I'm afraid so far,
our best candidate

05:32.632 --> 05:36.135
is the young man
from Jeepers Sweepers.

05:38.071 --> 05:41.908
I will move out if you hire
that prancing moron.

05:42.108 --> 05:43.176
All right, fine.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.177
Who would you hire?

05:44.677 --> 05:46.012
This-This-This Trish, I suppose?

05:46.312 --> 05:47.380
Well, I was right
about Daphne.

05:47.380 --> 05:47.840
Doesn't that count
for anything?

05:48.581 --> 05:50.016
You didn't even want to hire her.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.918
You thought she might steal.

05:55.655 --> 05:57.156
Did you really say that?

05:57.490 --> 05:58.558
Of course not!

05:58.558 --> 06:00.059
I don't remember.

06:01.427 --> 06:02.762
MARTIN:
Well, whoever gets hired

06:02.995 --> 06:05.064
is someone I'm going to have to
spend a lot of time with

06:05.565 --> 06:07.033
and I don't need
a lot of quiz questions

06:07.033 --> 06:09.502
and score sheets to get
a feel for someone's character

06:09.869 --> 06:14.040
Did I look like a thief?
Was it my shifty eyes?

06:14.040 --> 06:15.675
Look, if you don't trust
my judgment, Frasier,

06:15.675 --> 06:17.510
just have the guts
to say so.
No, all right.

06:17.777 --> 06:19.846
Fine. You can hire whoever
you want to.

06:19.846 --> 06:21.247
You want this Trish?
Fine, call her.

06:21.647 --> 06:23.716
Great. I'll call her right now
and tell her she's hired.

06:24.183 --> 06:25.685
And I'll tell her
where you keep
your valuables.

06:26.219 --> 06:26.719
FRASIER:
Oh!

06:27.153 --> 06:29.222
Would you give it a rest?

06:31.724 --> 06:34.227
Hey, Niles.
Have a seat.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.228
Thank you.

06:35.728 --> 06:36.729
I'll have my usual.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.733
Oh, no, uh, bottled water,
room temperature.

06:42.168 --> 06:46.072
Hey, slow down, little man.
What are we celebrating?

06:46.339 --> 06:48.408
I can't drink anything
that's too hot.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.342
I have a toothache.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.778
Oh. You been to the dentist?

06:52.178 --> 06:53.746
Yes, but he said
the tooth is perfectly healthy.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.248
I still have
this throbbing pain.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.818
Oh, it's probably just a sinus infection

06:58.818 --> 07:00.119
Have you had a cold lately?

07:00.353 --> 07:02.422
A couple of weeks ago, yes,
but I'm-I'm over it.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.423
It's probably what it is.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.424
A sinus infection.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.992
It happens to me
all the time.

07:05.992 --> 07:08.060
In all likelihood, I'm sure
you're right.
Thank you.

07:08.060 --> 07:10.263
Of course I'm right. What else could it be?

07:10.530 --> 07:13.099
Actually, a toothache
can be referred pain

07:13.099 --> 07:14.400
from something else.

07:14.667 --> 07:15.701
Referred pain?

07:15.701 --> 07:17.003
That's right.

07:17.203 --> 07:18.771
For example, if I had
a heart condition

07:18.771 --> 07:20.273
I might not have pain
in my chest.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.776
I might have pain in my tooth,
you see? Referred pain.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.578
So, while you're

07:25.778 --> 07:27.847
probably right about the sinus infection

07:27.847 --> 07:29.849
let's not discount
the one-in-10,000 chance

07:30.349 --> 07:32.251
that it might be something
more serious.

07:32.585 --> 07:33.653
Oh, now I get it.

07:33.653 --> 07:35.655
So the pain in my butt

07:35.655 --> 07:38.491
might actually be coming from across the table.

07:41.861 --> 07:44.363
Something like that, yes.

07:44.864 --> 07:46.332
Oh, look.

07:46.332 --> 07:49.635
I'm the winner of a fanny pack.

07:49.869 --> 07:50.937
Congratulations.
Thank you.

07:50.937 --> 07:52.805
You have no idea
what it is, do you?

07:53.206 --> 07:55.775
Uh, not really, no.

07:55.775 --> 07:56.642
Hey, look.

07:56.909 --> 07:58.478
It says here

07:58.478 --> 08:01.481
the odds of winning it
are one in 10,000.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.816
Ooh... spooky.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.118
Same odds as

08:06.118 --> 08:08.020
that toothache
being a heart attack.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.789
Maybe it's a sign.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.058
It's a good sign.
By beating those odds once,

08:12.558 --> 08:13.559
it makes it that
much more unlikely

08:14.060 --> 08:16.062
that something so improbable
can happen to me again.

08:16.562 --> 08:17.363
WOMAN: Niles.
Mmm.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.667
Hello, Daphne.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.839
Okay, that's weird.

08:32.311 --> 08:34.813
MARTIN:
So, that's the grand tour.

08:35.313 --> 08:36.249
Hard to know where to start.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.818
I don't have much time
before I have to go.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.253
What? You're leaving already?

08:40.620 --> 08:42.188
Yeah, um,
I have this lunch thing.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.589
I hope you don't mind.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.258
Well, the problem is
it's this friend

08:45.491 --> 08:47.560
that I've been putting off
because I've been too busy

08:47.560 --> 08:48.961
but now I finally don't have any excuse.

08:49.295 --> 08:51.864
We're going to try
that new rib place
down in Belltown.

08:51.864 --> 08:52.865
Oh, I hear that's great.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.301
Yeah, I can bring you back
a great big bag of them.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.703
But enough chit-chat.
I've got dishes to do.

08:57.703 --> 08:58.704
(chuckling)
Yeah...

08:58.704 --> 09:00.206
Oh, hold on.
Can I offer a suggestion?

09:00.606 --> 09:01.974
You're the boss.
What Daphne did was

09:02.174 --> 09:03.242
put a load of laundry in first

09:03.242 --> 09:05.144
and that way you can do
two things at once.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.547
Okay. Although, I prefer
to do laundry

09:07.547 --> 09:10.049
at the end of the day,
and that way I can read

09:10.049 --> 09:11.551
when the clothes
are in the dryer.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.320
I mean, it's about the only "me" time
I have on this job.

09:16.622 --> 09:19.492
Hey, Dad.
Ready for breakfast?

09:19.725 --> 09:21.193
Well, thanks for the invite,
but I can't go.

09:21.193 --> 09:22.562
We didn't invite you.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.063
You called us and badgered us

09:24.063 --> 09:26.032
until we rearranged our schedule.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.466
Yeah, well, that was before
Trish came.

09:27.967 --> 09:29.936
I really think I should hang
around and show her the ropes.

09:29.936 --> 09:31.404
Maybe you should show her where

09:31.404 --> 09:32.905
the room freshener is.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.340
It smells like
stale cigars in here.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.309
I had some of the guys in
last night for poker.

09:36.309 --> 09:37.344
Oh, hey, Niles!

09:37.910 --> 09:39.412
Check this out.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.981
Got a great new card trick.

09:41.981 --> 09:42.982
Oh, goody.

09:42.982 --> 09:47.420
Yeah. It's called
"The Amazing Niles"

09:47.820 --> 09:50.389
or "The Amazing..." whoever
you're doing the trick with.

09:50.389 --> 09:52.391
Like if I was doing it
with Daphne

09:52.391 --> 09:53.893
it'd be "The Amazing Daphne."

09:53.893 --> 09:55.728
If I was doing it with Frasier,
it'd be...

09:56.028 --> 09:57.096
"The Amazing Frasier."
Yeah, I get it, Dad.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.431
Yeah.

09:58.731 --> 10:00.299
That's just my patter.
Okay...

10:00.800 --> 10:04.303
Okay, Amazing Niles,
I want you to draw

10:04.303 --> 10:06.639
the ace of spades
out of this deck.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.507
Uh, something tells me

10:08.507 --> 10:11.444
that it's going to be this one right here.
Ooh!

10:11.844 --> 10:14.780
Ladies and gentlemen,
he drew the ace of spades.

10:15.214 --> 10:16.616
Amazing, Amazing Niles.

10:17.049 --> 10:18.117
Isn't that a great trick?

10:18.618 --> 10:19.452
Hey, wait a minute.

10:19.752 --> 10:23.055
How come this deck only has
aces of spades?

10:23.389 --> 10:24.957
What? No, this is the tri...

10:28.461 --> 10:30.463
Wait... wait a minute.
Uh...

10:30.463 --> 10:32.465
This isn't the trick deck.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.299
Holy cow!

10:33.299 --> 10:34.100
Wh...

10:36.235 --> 10:38.304
You just drew the card
I asked you for.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.305
What are the odds?

10:39.305 --> 10:41.707
I wonder if you could do it again.

10:42.074 --> 10:43.976
No. No, no, no, no.

10:44.243 --> 10:45.811
Only... only one
performance a day.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.516
Is something wrong?

10:50.750 --> 10:53.319
What?
No.

10:53.819 --> 10:56.822
Oh, you know, since we're not
going to have breakfast

10:56.822 --> 10:58.257
maybe we should go.

10:58.591 --> 10:59.659
All right.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.994
That way we can pick up
your car from the shop.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.229
What happened to your car?

11:03.496 --> 11:05.498
It got struck by lightning.

11:09.935 --> 11:12.004
Okay, washer's running as we speak.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.439
Anything else before I go?

11:13.439 --> 11:15.775
You going to lunch now?
It's only 10:00.
Already?

11:16.108 --> 11:18.177
I guess the dishes
will have to wait.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.679
I've got a couple
of errands to run

11:19.679 --> 11:21.113
and then I have
a hair appointment.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.581
Trish, I'm a little surprised

11:22.581 --> 11:24.083
that you're taking off
like this.

11:24.483 --> 11:25.551
I'm a little surprised, too.

11:25.551 --> 11:26.552
I thought my first day

11:26.552 --> 11:28.554
would be more like
orientation, you know?

11:28.554 --> 11:30.556
Show me around,
explain my duties

11:30.556 --> 11:31.957
and then I start work
the next day.

11:32.291 --> 11:33.292
Why would you think that?

11:33.659 --> 11:35.227
Well, it's been that way
every other place

11:35.227 --> 11:37.129
that I've worked,
and I've had alot of jobs.

11:37.463 --> 11:40.533
Well, listen, Trish, I kind of
went out on a limb for you

11:41.033 --> 11:43.035
and I'll never hear
the end of it from my son

11:43.035 --> 11:43.936
if you let me down.

11:44.303 --> 11:45.371
Don't worry.

11:45.371 --> 11:46.872
You are not going
to regret hiring me.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.874
Tomorrow morning,
I'll be like the White Tornado

11:48.874 --> 11:50.142
Remember those commercials?

11:50.342 --> 11:51.277
White Tornado?
That'll be me.

11:51.610 --> 11:52.678
Ten o'clock.

11:52.678 --> 11:54.046
So you're not coming back after lunch?

11:54.380 --> 11:57.349
Oh, trust me. You don't want me
cleaning this place drunk.

11:57.683 --> 11:58.718
(laughs)

11:58.718 --> 11:59.652
Oh, and that reminds me.

12:00.052 --> 12:00.619
I don't work Mondays.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.054
Gosh, you know,
I better get going.

12:02.621 --> 12:04.390
If I'm late to this lunch,
how's that going to look?

12:04.690 --> 12:05.558
What about the laundry?

12:05.825 --> 12:08.828
10:00 tomorrow,
along with those ribs.

12:11.263 --> 12:13.232
Well, I hear
the washer going.

12:13.666 --> 12:16.235
I assume that means
our new employee is hard at it.

12:16.669 --> 12:17.236
Oh, yeah.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.206
She's like the White Tornado

12:20.639 --> 12:22.208
Dad, you know your basketball references

12:22.208 --> 12:23.476
go right over my head.

12:23.676 --> 12:26.579
You know...

12:26.846 --> 12:28.414
she's certainly got
her work cut out for her

12:28.414 --> 12:30.416
cleaning up this mess
you and your buddies
made last night.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.417
Well, you don't have to worry about it.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.419
She's all about the work.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.922
Listen, Dad,
I think I owe
you an apology.

12:36.922 --> 12:37.857
For what?

12:38.224 --> 12:39.291
Well, for thinking

12:39.291 --> 12:41.093
I was a better judge
of people than you are.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.728
Just want you to know that I do

12:42.928 --> 12:44.497
trust your judgment.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.932
Maybe I don't say that
often enough.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.267
Anyway, I hope
you can forgive me.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.770
There's nothing to forgive, son.

12:51.070 --> 12:52.104
Thanks, Dad.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.939
I'll see you later.

12:57.042 --> 12:59.111
Not now, boy.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.114
We've got an apartment to clean.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.622
Hi, Niles.
How's it going?

13:09.922 --> 13:11.490
I'm as good as dead.

13:11.924 --> 13:13.826
I've been doing research

13:14.093 --> 13:15.161
into my family health history.

13:15.161 --> 13:16.662
My great-uncle Timothy

13:16.662 --> 13:18.430
keeled over from a heart attack
at my age.

13:20.599 --> 13:22.668
Bottled water. Please.

13:24.670 --> 13:26.672
Are you talking about that tooth again?

13:27.173 --> 13:28.674
It's still throbbing,
thank you.

13:29.108 --> 13:32.111
Which means my heart is probably
on its last legs.

13:32.444 --> 13:35.281
Come on, Niles, you said it was
a one-in-a-million chance.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.050
One in 10,000, and I've been beating
those odds all week.

13:38.050 --> 13:39.552
I don't believe in omens,

13:39.552 --> 13:41.887
but these are getting
harder and harder to ignore.

13:42.188 --> 13:44.557
So are you.

13:44.790 --> 13:46.358
I flipped a coin 17 times
last night,

13:46.358 --> 13:47.860
and every time it came up tails.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.362
I only stopped because
I was getting a blister.

13:50.362 --> 13:51.697
Thank you.

13:51.964 --> 13:54.333
How does Daphne put up with all this?

13:54.533 --> 13:55.601
I haven't told her about it,

13:55.601 --> 13:57.503
'cause unlike you,
she'd worry about me.

13:57.870 --> 13:59.939
Get your heart checked
and stop obsessing about it.

13:59.939 --> 14:01.240
I'm going to.

14:01.473 --> 14:03.042
In all probability, there's a

14:03.542 --> 14:05.444
there's a perfectly
reasonable ex... (gasps)

14:05.811 --> 14:07.713
What?

14:07.980 --> 14:10.382
I won another fanny pack.

14:13.752 --> 14:15.754
No, I'm not mad at you, Trish.

14:15.754 --> 14:18.224
I'm just a little disappointed

14:18.224 --> 14:20.759
Well, yesterday it was
your neighbor's funeral

14:20.759 --> 14:23.162
and today you got the flu.

14:23.495 --> 14:26.532
No, I kind of believe you,
but...

14:26.966 --> 14:30.536
You know, this apartment
doesn't clean itself, so... Huh?

14:31.036 --> 14:32.404
Okay. Tomorrow.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.273
9:00 sharp.

14:34.273 --> 14:36.242
10:00? Okay.

14:36.242 --> 14:39.245
Well, I'll see you
when you get here. Okay, bye.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.281
(doorknob rattling)

14:45.751 --> 14:47.786
Oh, for God... sakes...

14:47.786 --> 14:49.255
Hey! Careful, mister!

14:49.255 --> 14:51.724
You're going to get
water all over a clean floor

14:52.057 --> 14:53.592
You know, maybe you can have Trish

14:54.026 --> 14:55.594
wax this floor
tomorrow, huh?

14:55.594 --> 14:57.930
She already did, and
it took her two hours!

14:58.197 --> 15:00.266
And it just took you two seconds

15:00.266 --> 15:02.234
to mess it up
and start complaining.

15:02.601 --> 15:05.170
Well, I'm not complaining, Dad
but look at the streaks here.

15:05.170 --> 15:07.172
It's like she never
waxed a floor before.

15:07.172 --> 15:11.677
All you do is nag, nag, nag.

15:12.111 --> 15:14.680
Meanwhile, she tried a new fabric
softener on your sweater

15:14.680 --> 15:15.681
and you didn't even notice.

15:16.181 --> 15:18.117
Well, my sweaters are supposed
to be dry cleaned.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.486
Oh.
Oh, and remind me

15:20.886 --> 15:22.888
to say something to her
about flipping my mattress.

15:23.255 --> 15:26.725
What the hell are you trying
to do, kill her?!

15:27.026 --> 15:30.095
Easy, easy, Dad.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.097
There's no reason
to get all riled up.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.065
My God,

15:33.465 --> 15:34.533
you're actually perspiring.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.535
Well, I just think
some people around here

15:37.036 --> 15:38.337
don't realize how hard she works.

15:38.570 --> 15:41.640
--
Well, I'll say this much

15:41.640 --> 15:43.609
the place does smell lemony fresh.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.113
Shows what you know.
It's country breeze.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.619
Daphne, I...

15:54.119 --> 15:55.621
have to go out for a while.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.989
All right.

15:57.423 --> 16:00.492
No place out of the ordinary--
just... out.

16:00.993 --> 16:03.862
Okay. See you later.

16:08.334 --> 16:10.402
I can't believe this is happening.

16:10.402 --> 16:14.840
After all those misspent years
of frustration and yearning

16:14.840 --> 16:17.409
I finally find the fulfillment
of my dreams...

16:17.910 --> 16:19.912
only to have it snatched away.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.814
Look at her.

16:22.114 --> 16:26.518
She's so beautiful, so perfect

16:26.785 --> 16:30.322
She deserves nothing but happiness.

16:30.756 --> 16:33.325
I hope when I'm gone

16:33.325 --> 16:36.829
she's able to make a life with someone else.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.531
After a suitable period
of mourning, of course.

16:41.367 --> 16:42.334
Niles?

16:42.668 --> 16:44.737
Yes, my love?

16:45.137 --> 16:46.705
When are you going
to change the paper

16:46.705 --> 16:48.707
in the bottom
of the birdcage, hmm?

16:48.707 --> 16:50.142
I've asked you three times already.

16:50.476 --> 16:51.844
Soon as I get back.

16:53.612 --> 16:55.180
Maybe when I'm gone

16:55.180 --> 16:59.184
Her Majesty can muck out
her own birdcage.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.688
Hey, Fras, sorry to bother you.

17:02.688 --> 17:06.191
Uh, Trish was wondering where
you keep the silver polish.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.693
Right.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.662
I told her about that tarnish
on your shrimp fork.

17:11.063 --> 17:13.132
She suggested a place you could keep it

17:13.598 --> 17:16.001
where the air won't get to it.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.238
Really? Perhaps she and I should
have a discussion about that.

17:19.570 --> 17:21.440
What are you doing here?
Well, my lunch canceled.

17:21.640 --> 17:22.708
I thought I might drop by,
see if

17:22.708 --> 17:23.575
you'd like to join me
for a bite.

17:23.575 --> 17:26.045
Oh, sure. Love to.
Let me get my coat.

17:26.478 --> 17:28.047
Right. I'll just tell Trish we're leaving.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.381
Where is she?

17:29.381 --> 17:31.750
Oh, uh, she's in the powder room.
Let's go

17:31.984 --> 17:33.552
Actually, I-I'd
rather wait, Dad.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.853
You see, I wanted to discuss

17:35.087 --> 17:36.155
a new vacuuming pattern with her.

17:36.588 --> 17:40.159
Uh, well... actually, Fras,
this might not be a good time.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.594
Uh, that shrimp fork thing
really set her off.

17:42.594 --> 17:45.130
She kind of went to pieces
and locked herself in there.

17:45.130 --> 17:46.598
She did?

17:47.032 --> 17:48.434
I had no idea she was so fragile.

17:48.834 --> 17:49.902
.
Well, she'll get over it

17:50.402 --> 17:52.604
She just, uh, needs
to be alone for a while. Uh...

17:52.871 --> 17:54.440
She'll be fine.
Uh, bye, Trish.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.941
No, no, Dad,
you know what?

17:55.941 --> 17:56.942
If I've hurt her feelings

17:57.443 --> 17:58.944
then it is incumbent
upon me to apologize.

17:58.944 --> 18:00.446
Well...

18:00.446 --> 18:01.447
Trish, it's Dr. Crane.

18:01.447 --> 18:02.948
Could you come out here, please?

18:02.948 --> 18:04.950
I'd like to have
a word with you.

18:07.886 --> 18:08.954
The old silent treatment.

18:08.954 --> 18:11.223
Well, two can play that game.
Let's go.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.991
No, no, Dad.
Why don't you talk to her?

18:12.991 --> 18:14.493
Oh, I don't think so.

18:14.493 --> 18:15.461
Please, Dad, she likes you.

18:15.461 --> 18:16.462
Please.

18:19.998 --> 18:22.000
Uh, Trish?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.502
Hi. It's Marty.

18:23.502 --> 18:25.504
Uh, listen,  I know you're upset

18:25.504 --> 18:28.006
but I'd like to talk to you.

18:28.006 --> 18:33.512
Yeah, um...
would you unlock the door?

18:33.512 --> 18:35.514
That a girl.

18:42.254 --> 18:45.324
All right, you just take
all the time you need.

18:46.825 --> 18:48.327
Okay, well,
she accepted your apology

18:48.327 --> 18:50.829
but she just wants to be alone
for a little while

18:50.829 --> 18:52.331
so, uh, let's go.

18:52.331 --> 18:55.134
Dad, I really should apologize
to her in person.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.402
Well, uh, I don't think
this is the time.

18:57.803 --> 18:58.737
Why not?

18:58.737 --> 19:00.672
Well, you have been
pretty critical.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.041
Well, you know, I also think that she's made

19:03.041 --> 19:04.543
some real improvements around here.

19:04.543 --> 19:06.044
Tell her that.

19:06.545 --> 19:08.046
(sighs)

19:14.820 --> 19:16.255
She wants an example.

19:23.195 --> 19:25.130
How should I know?
Make something up.

19:25.531 --> 19:29.001
Oh, no wonder she's mad,
you ungrateful son of a bitch!

19:35.941 --> 19:36.475
MARTIN:
All right.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.443
See you later.

19:41.446 --> 19:43.448
Well, now I think
you've made things worse

19:43.448 --> 19:46.418
It wouldn't surprise me
if she didn't come in tomorrow

19:48.000 --> 19:54.074

19:58.897 --> 20:00.899
You didn't tell me you had a sister.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.801
Dad!

20:07.506 --> 20:09.441
All right,
what the hell is going on?

20:09.741 --> 20:11.810
No idea. I just came by
for my paycheck.

20:11.810 --> 20:12.778
MARTIN:
Well, uh..

20:13.178 --> 20:14.246
I got some bad news about that, Trish.

20:14.746 --> 20:16.582
I'm sorry, but we're going to have to let you go.

20:16.848 --> 20:18.417
Oh. Okay.
But you still owe me

20:18.417 --> 20:20.752
for the days I was supposed
to be here last week.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.589
Sure, sure, and there'll be
a check in the mail

20:24.089 --> 20:26.592
sometime after the first..

20:27.125 --> 20:29.428
asteroid hits Earth.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.235
Okay, lay it on me

20:36.235 --> 20:38.237
I'm-I'm prepared for the worst.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.038
Is it my heart?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.306
I'm afraid so.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.308
Aha!

20:44.810 --> 20:46.778
What?

20:47.179 --> 20:48.247
There is an anomaly in your EKG.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.182
I'm going to have
to check you into

20:50.582 --> 20:52.150
the hospital.

20:52.150 --> 20:53.652
Oh. Uh, well, hm.

20:54.152 --> 20:55.654
Uh, I guess I can clear
my schedule.

20:56.154 --> 20:57.656
Uh, how's, uh,
how's tomorrow afternoon?

20:58.123 --> 20:59.925
No, no, no. Niles?
Hm?

21:00.125 --> 21:01.693
You need to go right now.
