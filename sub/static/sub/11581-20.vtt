00:01.435 --> 00:03.404
NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.437 --> 00:05.806
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:05.839 --> 00:08.376
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.409 --> 00:10.378
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.411 --> 00:11.712
are members of an elite squad

00:11.745 --> 00:13.547
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.581 --> 00:17.785
These are their stories.

00:17.818 --> 00:20.721
Every day I drag
my marigolds down here.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.656
Every day I drag 'em back...

00:22.690 --> 00:26.060
I know you guys got a job to do,
but come on...

00:26.094 --> 00:26.927
it's been like this for a week.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.229
OFFICER:
Sorry, but
a crime scene

00:28.262 --> 00:30.498
takes priority over
your flowers.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.365
Some priority.

00:31.399 --> 00:34.368
I haven't seen a cop
around here in days.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.337
Mounted Sergeant to Central.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.107
Who's on the crime scene
in the Rambles?

00:39.140 --> 00:41.509
WOMAN ( over radio ):
Central to Mounted Post Two.

00:41.542 --> 00:44.378
Negative on a crime scene
at that location.

00:44.412 --> 00:47.448
Central, it's got to be,
it's still taped off.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.550
Nothing's been reported there.

00:53.321 --> 00:54.322
Scene's stone cold.

00:54.355 --> 00:57.758
Killer went out of his way
to screw us on this one.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.760
He gets points for originality.

00:59.793 --> 01:02.863
Never seen a perp cordon off
his own crime scene.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.666
Millions of places
you can buy police tape.

01:05.699 --> 01:08.269
My son stuck it across
his bedroom door.

01:08.302 --> 01:09.270
Any ID?

01:09.303 --> 01:10.271
No.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.605
We know how she died?

01:11.639 --> 01:13.574
Strangled, judging by the
bruising on her neck.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.409
Probably raped,
but she's been here awhile.

01:15.443 --> 01:17.311
Won't know for sure
until after the autopsy.

01:17.345 --> 01:18.679
Perp knew what he was doing.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.714
He clipped her fingernails
after he killed her.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.416
STABLER:
After he killed her?

01:22.450 --> 01:23.617
How do you know that?

01:23.651 --> 01:24.885
Same polish on her toes.

01:24.918 --> 01:25.886
It's fresh,

01:25.919 --> 01:27.221
no chips.

01:27.255 --> 01:31.259
No woman I know cuts
her nails to the quick
after a manicure.

01:31.292 --> 01:34.162
So she scratched him--
he cut her fingernails

01:34.195 --> 01:36.197
to get rid of the DNA
underneath.

01:36.230 --> 01:39.233
Uses crime scene tape
and he knows his forensics.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.834
We looking for a cop?

01:40.868 --> 01:42.736
Sure looks like it.

01:46.540 --> 01:50.811
Captioning sponsored by
UNIVERSAL NETWORK TELEVISION

01:50.844 --> 01:53.547
and NBC

02:33.921 --> 02:35.823
Your perp has
to be an insider.

02:35.856 --> 02:36.824
He knows too much.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.492
No hairs, no fluids,
no prints.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.228
So, basically,
you've got nothing.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.262
I didn't say that.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.930
He choked her
with one hand.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.699
Held something over
her mouth with the other.

02:45.733 --> 02:48.236
I found a fiber in
your victim's trachea.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.470
Oilskin cotton.

02:49.503 --> 02:53.574
She must've aspirated it
during the attack.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.543
What's the fiber from?

02:55.576 --> 02:59.347
Could be a raincoat,
or maybe a pair of gloves.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.749
Check out
the bruise pattern.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.684
The thumb is to the right
of the fingers,

03:03.717 --> 03:05.319
which means the
perp strangled her

03:05.353 --> 03:06.387
with his left hand.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.755
And he used
a condom.

03:07.788 --> 03:08.789
You find spermicide?

03:08.822 --> 03:09.957
No, rubbing alcohol.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.826
He gave her a rubdown
and a douche.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.729
But he missed
a small piece of latex.

03:15.763 --> 03:20.268
You can tell the condom broke
from the tear pattern.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.903
So our perp knew he had
to clean up after himself.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.238
I was able to match

03:24.272 --> 03:26.440
the fragment
with the brand.

03:26.474 --> 03:27.975
"Twisted Desire."

03:28.008 --> 03:30.344
We got a match
on our victim's prints.

03:30.378 --> 03:33.247
She was arrested last year
for obstruction.

03:33.281 --> 03:34.848
Say hello
to Rebecca Wheeler.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.917
She lived at Claremont
and 107th.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.252
Well, if our perp's
a cop,

03:38.286 --> 03:39.620
Cragen's going to be
all over this.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.455
I'll call him and
have him meet us there.

03:41.489 --> 03:42.756
You got a time of death?

03:42.790 --> 03:43.624
Sometime last week.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.893
But she ate right before
she was killed.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.995
I found undigested sushi
in her stomach.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.963
You find out when Rebecca
had dinner,

03:49.997 --> 03:51.432
you'll know when she died.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.739
We've got take-out cartons
and a credit card receipt

03:58.772 --> 04:00.774
from Miss Yoko's
Sushi Restaurant.

04:00.808 --> 04:04.044
Friday night,
8:05. $42.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.046
That's a lot
of sushi for one person.

04:06.079 --> 04:06.880
So she buys dinner
for two.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.482
There was no sign
of forced entry.

04:08.516 --> 04:09.950
She had take-out
with her killer?

04:09.983 --> 04:11.051
Could still be a cop.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.886
I mean, check out
these posters--

04:12.920 --> 04:13.921
"Stop Police Brutality."

04:13.954 --> 04:15.122
"Free Pedro Sanchez."

04:15.155 --> 04:18.292
She's a walking crusade against
the criminal justice system.

04:18.326 --> 04:19.993
She might have pissed off
a lot of people

04:20.027 --> 04:20.794
in law enforcement.

04:20.828 --> 04:22.830
Our killer is organized,
intelligent,

04:22.863 --> 04:25.866
with a good knowledge
of forensics.

04:25.899 --> 04:28.602
His post-offense behavior is
meticulous--

04:28.636 --> 04:31.071
the nails, the douche,
the alcohol rubdown.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.073
BENSON:
Found this turkey baster

04:33.106 --> 04:34.041
in the bathtub.

04:34.074 --> 04:34.875
He probably filled it with
rubbing alcohol

04:34.908 --> 04:36.744
and used it to wash
away the DNA.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.379
STABLER:
Why not just dump the body
in the river,

04:38.412 --> 04:39.212
let the water destroy
the evidence?

04:39.246 --> 04:40.648
HUANG:
Because he cared about her.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.316
When he left her
in the park,

04:42.350 --> 04:43.851
he laid her gently
on the ground.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.553
He posed her, he covered
her with leaves.

04:45.586 --> 04:49.357
Why use the crime scene tape to
keep us from finding the body?

04:49.390 --> 04:50.558
HUANG:
To send us a message.

04:50.591 --> 04:51.825
He's smarter than we are.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.694
He could be a Police Academy
washout,

04:53.727 --> 04:54.762
a disgraced ex-cop...

04:54.795 --> 04:56.497
STABLER:
Or a criminology student.

04:56.530 --> 04:57.598
Rebecca's schedule.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.066
She was taking
graduate courses

04:59.099 --> 05:01.335
in Criminal Justice
at Wallace University.

05:01.369 --> 05:02.370
Find her advisor.

05:02.403 --> 05:05.373
See if somebody had
a grudge against Rebecca.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.408
MAN:
Nobody had problems
with Rebecca.

05:07.441 --> 05:08.809
The whole department loved her.

05:08.842 --> 05:11.745
She was always around when other
students needed to talk.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.914
She was missing for a week,
Professor Vega.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.483
No one found that strange?

05:15.516 --> 05:17.718
She was taking time off
to finish her thesis.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.119
Did Rebecca
have a boyfriend--

05:19.152 --> 05:19.953
maybe an angry ex?

05:19.987 --> 05:22.089
I don't think Rebecca
dated much.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.992
Whatever free time she had,
she spent doing research.

05:25.025 --> 05:28.529
Her police record said
she was arrested last
year for obstruction.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.030
Those charges were dropped.

05:30.063 --> 05:33.434
She was interviewing an ex-con
and got caught in a drug sweep.

05:33.467 --> 05:34.668
She hang out with
a lot of ex-cons?

05:34.702 --> 05:36.404
You say that like
they're lepers.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.538
Not at all.

05:37.571 --> 05:40.107
Just wondered
what attracted her
to this line of work.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.042
Her thesis was on
convict re-entry--

05:42.075 --> 05:43.944
How most ex-cons end up back
in prison

05:43.977 --> 05:48.115
because the system
sets them up to fail.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.116
Yeah? How so?

05:49.149 --> 05:50.183
Well, you should
see them

05:50.217 --> 05:52.753
when they're discharged
from Rikers, detective.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.021
Five bucks in their pockets

05:54.054 --> 05:55.423
and all the whores and dealers

05:55.456 --> 05:56.924
lining up to take it from
them...

05:56.957 --> 05:59.059
Rebecca thought they deserved
a better chance.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.060
STABLER:
She ever deal

06:00.093 --> 06:01.128
with any sex offenders?

06:01.161 --> 06:02.730
Rapists are practically
impossible

06:02.763 --> 06:03.664
to rehabilitate.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.434
She was interested
in uneducated screw-ups

06:06.467 --> 06:08.602
who wanted to get their lives
together.

06:08.636 --> 06:09.737
Mostly junkies.

06:09.770 --> 06:12.005
She helped them get clean,
stay clean.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.408
STABLER:
They ever give her trouble?

06:14.442 --> 06:16.176
Well, if they did,
she never told me.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.679
We're going to need
the inmates' names.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.914
Kyle Luhrmann was working
on the research with her.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.450
He'll give them to you.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.522
Crackheads, speed freaks,
muggers--

06:28.556 --> 06:30.824
Rebecca interviewed
every inmate at Sing-Sing

06:30.858 --> 06:32.660
within six months
of their release.

06:32.693 --> 06:33.994
Are these their
current addresses?

06:34.027 --> 06:35.996
For those who aren't
back in jail or dead.

06:36.029 --> 06:39.800
Can you tell us where
you were Friday night?

06:39.833 --> 06:41.669
At a department party.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.136
Got so trashed a couple
of friends

06:43.170 --> 06:44.638
had to drive me home
and pour me into bed.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.039
We're going
to need their names.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.074
Sure.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.910
Is this Rebecca's desk?

06:49.943 --> 06:51.445
Yeah.

06:51.479 --> 06:53.146
I haven't touched it.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.147
Mind if I take a look?

06:54.181 --> 06:55.248
Good luck
finding anything.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.918
STABLER:
Did you interview
the inmates with Rebecca?

06:57.951 --> 06:59.620
No. I got my share of sob
stories

06:59.653 --> 07:02.890
interning at Probation
last summer.

07:02.923 --> 07:03.757
That's why I crunch the numbers

07:03.791 --> 07:04.725
and Rebecca did all
the people work.

07:04.758 --> 07:05.526
Any sob stories

07:05.559 --> 07:07.828
in particular that
got to Rebecca?

07:07.861 --> 07:08.929
There was one guy

07:08.962 --> 07:11.899
who found out his kid had cancer
the day he gots out.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.034
Went straight for the needle.
Got wrecked.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.869
Rebecca helped him
go cold turkey.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.505
She even crawled into bed

07:17.538 --> 07:19.607
with the guy to help him
through the DTs.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.674
Where's the guy now?

07:20.708 --> 07:21.675
Dead.

07:21.709 --> 07:22.910
Idiot OD'd a week later.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.845
Did Rebecca get close

07:24.878 --> 07:25.813
with any other junkies?

07:25.846 --> 07:27.815
She said there was one
guy that definitely

07:27.848 --> 07:28.916
wanted to get close.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.017
Freakin' crackhead.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.019
Every time she went out
to Sing-Sing,

07:32.052 --> 07:33.921
he'd throw his arms
around her,

07:33.954 --> 07:34.988
tell her he loved her.

07:35.022 --> 07:35.989
Creeped me out.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.057
Rebecca feel

07:37.090 --> 07:37.925
the same way?

07:37.958 --> 07:40.628
She was fine till
he tried to kiss her.

07:40.661 --> 07:41.729
She walked out.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.764
Two days later she was back
there talking to him.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.232
What's the
guy's name?

07:45.265 --> 07:46.534
Rudy something.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.668
Last I heard

07:47.701 --> 07:50.704
he was still
in prison.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.606
BENSON:
Rudy Lemcke-- burg two,
ten months.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.741
Assault, 18 months.

07:53.774 --> 07:54.908
Possession with intent,
two years.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.578
This guy's been using the
revolving door at Sing-Sing

07:57.611 --> 07:58.846
for the last ten years.

07:58.879 --> 08:01.749
And Rebecca wanted
to take care of him
like he was a stray cat.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.284
Her research partner said that
she gave Rudy her phone number

08:04.317 --> 08:05.786
so he could call
her day or night.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.721
Sounds like she got off
talking to bad boys.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.890
Hey, warden at Sing-Sing
says our friend Rudy

08:09.923 --> 08:10.958
was paroled two weeks ago,

08:10.991 --> 08:13.093
with a doting wife waiting
for him on the outside.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.763
Find her, and bring Rudy in.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.666
I ain't seen Rudy since
he got out.

08:18.699 --> 08:19.867
Coming around looking
to hit it,

08:19.900 --> 08:21.735
I told him I was
with Dre now.

08:21.769 --> 08:24.304
You told the parole board
that Rudy could live with you.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.106
What else was I suppose to say?

08:26.139 --> 08:28.909
Keep my husband in jail
for another two years?

08:28.942 --> 08:31.612
I'm a good wife.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.547
BENSON:
Lying about his place
of residence

08:33.581 --> 08:35.282
is a violation
of Rudy's parole.

08:35.315 --> 08:38.018
Now, when we find him,
he's going back to prison.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.153
I don't know where he's at.
I was just trying to help him.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.722
STABLER:
You know, if Rudy
committed a crime

08:41.755 --> 08:42.890
while you were
covering for him,

08:42.923 --> 08:44.792
that makes you an accessory.

08:44.825 --> 08:45.793
You playing me?

08:45.826 --> 08:47.027
You want
to find out?

08:47.060 --> 08:49.863
Or you want to tell me
where I can find Rudy?

08:49.897 --> 08:52.232
Like I said, I kicked him out.

08:52.265 --> 08:56.804
Told him he had to find a job
or sleep with the bums

08:56.837 --> 08:58.271
down at St. Anne's.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.676
STABLER:
Sister Peg, I've never seen you

09:02.710 --> 09:04.277
in the kitchen
like this before.

09:04.311 --> 09:07.214
You get tired of handing out
condoms to the hookers?

09:07.247 --> 09:08.916
I go where my girls go.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.250
A lot end up homeless.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.185
City won't let
convicted drug users

09:12.219 --> 09:13.621
into public housing
anymore.

09:13.654 --> 09:14.788
This guy been
around here?

09:14.822 --> 09:15.623
Name's Rudy Lemcke.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.224
He was paroled a
couple weeks ago.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.291
Why are you looking for him?

09:18.325 --> 09:20.127
We think he raped
and murdered

09:20.160 --> 09:22.129
a woman who's
pretty much like you--

09:22.162 --> 09:23.964
just trying
to help out ex-cons.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.801
To your right.

09:27.835 --> 09:30.938
The guy with
the shopping cart.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.648
Rudy Lemcke?

09:40.681 --> 09:41.682
( grunts )

09:46.253 --> 09:48.656
I didn't do nothing!

09:48.689 --> 09:50.290
Then what are you
running from?

09:50.323 --> 09:51.258
Hey, that's my cart!

09:51.291 --> 09:53.627
Yeah, use it to carry bodies
around, do you?

09:53.661 --> 09:54.662
What bodies?

09:54.695 --> 09:55.663
Hers.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.164
I never seen her before.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.867
"Elements of Criminology"
by Javier Vega.

09:59.900 --> 10:00.701
That's Rebecca's advisor.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.135
You doing a little
light reading, Rudy?

10:02.169 --> 10:03.737
I'm trying
to educate myself.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.706
About how to cover up
your crime scene?

10:05.739 --> 10:06.974
Maybe wash away your DNA?

10:07.007 --> 10:07.941
You take him.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.110
I'll wait for CSU
to go through his crap.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.083
Just put the cherry
on the sundae.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.751
Found the sushi delivery guy.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.186
Says he remembers
seeing Rudy

10:19.219 --> 10:20.721
at Rebecca's apartment.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.289
Go give him the good news.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.326
You like sushi, Rudy?

10:26.359 --> 10:27.294
What?

10:27.327 --> 10:29.062
Eyewitness puts you
at Rebecca's apartment

10:29.096 --> 10:30.163
the night she died.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.665
Says that you smelled.

10:31.699 --> 10:33.066
She bought me dinner.
She was my friend.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.835
She was a student--
you're a crackhead.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.136
You're not friends.
She wanted to help me.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.938
Yeah, but you wanted more,
didn't you?

10:37.971 --> 10:39.372
You get out of prison,
your wife's got

10:39.406 --> 10:40.407
a new man, so you figure

10:40.440 --> 10:42.175
you'll take what you need
from Rebecca, right?

10:42.209 --> 10:43.677
No!
She resists,
you choke her.

10:43.711 --> 10:44.945
Maybe you didn't
mean to kill her,

10:44.978 --> 10:46.880
but next thing you know
she's not moving...

10:46.914 --> 10:47.948
You got it all wrong, lady...

10:47.981 --> 10:48.949
You're scared.
You panicked.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.217
Then you remember
the book.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.551
That'll tell you exactly how to
clean up the mess you've made.

10:51.584 --> 10:54.955
Come on, Rudy.
Everything that you did
is in Professor Vega's book.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.691
Chapter 11-- "Crime Scene
Forensics," remember?

10:57.725 --> 10:59.192
I didn't mean
to hurt anybody.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.761
Write, Rudy,
just write.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.429
Maybe you'll see
the world again

11:02.462 --> 11:04.097
before you die.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.098
( knocking )

11:05.132 --> 11:08.969
Olivia, bring me that book.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.009
Did you talk to this man?

11:16.043 --> 11:17.377
BENSON:
It's Rebecca's advisor.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.746
His name's is Javier...

11:18.779 --> 11:19.747
Vega.

11:19.780 --> 11:20.680
I collared him in '76

11:20.714 --> 11:22.983
for killing a woman named
Joanna Lewis.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.886
He was coming off a three day
heroin bender,

11:25.919 --> 11:28.956
looking for some cash
when she surprised him
ripping off her place.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.724
BENSON:
Doesn't mean
that he's our guy.

11:30.758 --> 11:33.961
Vega strangled her
with his left hand.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.896
Rudy's right-handed.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.898
CRAGEN:
And so high that
he would confess

11:37.931 --> 11:39.232
to killing
his own mother.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.367
Vega's our killer.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.170
He tried to cover his ass
with that crime scene gag.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.806
Been laughing at us ever since.
Bring him in.

11:45.839 --> 11:46.907
BENSON:
I'll call Novak,

11:46.940 --> 11:47.908
ask her to get a warrant.

11:47.941 --> 11:48.842
He's destroyed
enough evidence.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.278
Don't give him the chance
to do it again.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.846
Professor?

11:52.880 --> 11:54.247
Hit it.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.320
Clear.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.956
Closet's empty.

12:04.958 --> 12:05.859
Nothing's in the dresser.

12:05.893 --> 12:08.095
This guy cleared out
of here in a hurry.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.935
Elliot.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.204
Condoms.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.506
Twisted Desire.

12:26.113 --> 12:26.980
We canvassed Rebecca's
neighbors.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.182
One of 'em remembers
seeing a 2003 Lexus RX

12:29.216 --> 12:31.885
parked outside her place
the night of the murder.

12:31.919 --> 12:32.953
Same car Vega drives.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.255
What, this guy has
a photographic memory for cars?

12:35.288 --> 12:36.556
He's a mechanic.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.859
Talked about that car
like it was Paris Hilton.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.027
Now, the same guy
saw a man

12:40.060 --> 12:41.361
in a black coat
and a red scarf

12:41.394 --> 12:44.397
stuffing a large bundle
into the back of a Lexus.

12:44.431 --> 12:47.000
He said "it looked like
big-ass bag full of crap."

12:47.034 --> 12:48.869
This poet make
a positive I.D. on Vega?

12:48.902 --> 12:50.804
No, it was too far away
to see his face.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.372
Let's get his car out
on the teletype

12:52.405 --> 12:53.606
and advise Narcotics.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.376
If Vega gets rattled enough,
he could be looking to score.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.978
Prison records says
he's been clean since '88.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.913
You think he's
gonna relapse after
all that time?

12:59.947 --> 13:00.948
I think he's gonna
go back

13:00.981 --> 13:02.950
to being who he really is,
a thug and a junkie.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.852
It's the only way
he knows how to survive.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.855
Did he rape this woman
that he killed in '76?

13:07.888 --> 13:10.023
Don't know.
He stuffed her in a steel drum.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.860
By the time we found the body,
it was partially decomposed.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.862
He's come a long way
since his junkie days.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.063
He's a professor,
for crying out loud.

13:16.096 --> 13:16.964
I mean, you know,

13:16.997 --> 13:18.531
why is he going
to screw everything up

13:18.565 --> 13:19.499
and kill again?

13:19.532 --> 13:20.633
Maybe Rebecca
dug up something
about his past

13:20.667 --> 13:23.236
when she was doing her research
about him at Sing-Sing.

13:23.270 --> 13:26.606
He killed her
to protect his
reputation?

13:26.639 --> 13:27.841
Go back through Rebecca's files.

13:27.875 --> 13:31.344
There's got to be something
that points to the Professor.

13:33.881 --> 13:36.016
All her research
is in those containers.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.185
But if Rebecca ever found out
about Vega's past,

13:38.218 --> 13:39.920
she didn't mention it.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.855
Vega ever mention
it to you?

13:41.889 --> 13:42.923
Not a word.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.425
No wonder
he was such a great teacher.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.860
He knew so much
about prison life,

13:46.894 --> 13:48.395
I should've guessed
he'd done time.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.998
How'd Rebecca get along
with him?

13:51.031 --> 13:51.798
Great.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.533
She came here
to study with him.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.202
The three of us used
to get together for drinks

13:55.235 --> 13:57.037
at his place every week
to talk about our research,

13:57.070 --> 13:59.306
but then...

13:59.339 --> 14:00.340
Then what?

14:00.373 --> 14:01.641
Well, last month,
she started

14:01.674 --> 14:03.143
backing out,
making excuses.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.477
Couple of weeks ago

14:04.511 --> 14:06.246
she said she had concert
tickets,

14:06.279 --> 14:08.148
but when I came here
after talking to Vega,

14:08.181 --> 14:10.150
I found Rebecca crying
at her desk.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.184
BENSON:
You ask why?

14:11.218 --> 14:12.652
Yeah, but she wouldn't tell me.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.055
I told her if she had a problem
with Vega,

14:15.088 --> 14:17.958
she better deal with it,
but then she got really upset.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.392
So what did you do?

14:19.426 --> 14:22.629
I told her to talk to the dean.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.000
Javier Vega
is a brilliant teacher.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.535
His life in prison gives him

14:28.568 --> 14:30.938
a unique perspective
on criminology.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.973
So you knowingly hired
an ex-con.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.375
Who's better qualified
to teach criminology

14:35.408 --> 14:36.509
than a former criminal?

14:36.543 --> 14:38.178
Well, then why keep
his past a secret?

14:38.211 --> 14:42.182
Unfortunately, parents and
donors aren't so open-minded.

14:42.215 --> 14:45.418
I wouldn't want my children
being taught by a murderer.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.154
Vega's a changed man.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.388
Prison is for rehabilitation,
detective.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.623
It's to keep
our children safe.

14:50.657 --> 14:54.194
Rebecca Wheeler didn't know
how dangerous her advisor was.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.496
Look what happened to her.

14:56.529 --> 14:57.664
Vega couldn't have killed her.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.299
He was her mentor.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.633
Rebecca had no reason
to be afraid of him.

15:00.667 --> 15:01.634
That's not what

15:01.668 --> 15:03.270
her research partner said.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.239
Kyle Luhrmann told her
to talk to you. Did she?

15:06.273 --> 15:07.340
Rebecca had
an appointment

15:07.374 --> 15:09.142
for next week.

15:09.176 --> 15:11.478
What about?

15:11.511 --> 15:12.412
She wanted to change advisors.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.546
Because she found out
that he was a murderer

15:13.580 --> 15:17.184
and didn't want her career tied
to a convicted felon.

15:17.217 --> 15:20.287
I don't believe that
Vega murdered her.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.955
But someone did find out
about him.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.623
I received this anonymous letter
last week,

15:23.656 --> 15:27.294
demanding that
I fire Vega

15:27.327 --> 15:31.098
for covering up his past.

15:31.131 --> 15:34.067
We'll take this and a copy
of his personnel file.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.070
You really think
it's impossible

15:37.104 --> 15:38.405
to rehabilitate
murderers?

15:38.438 --> 15:40.273
I don't know,
but why risk it?

15:40.307 --> 15:42.175
Once a killer
always a killer.

15:42.209 --> 15:43.410
You're a good Catholic.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.212
I thought Jesus taught
forgiveness?

15:45.245 --> 15:47.080
Jesus was perfect;
I'm not.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.548
Hey, hold on a second.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.153
Vega's got a daughter,
Gabrielle.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.587
Where is she?

15:54.621 --> 15:55.622
Here. She's a law student.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.225
She gets free tuition
'cause daddy's a professor.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.094
I don't know
where my father is.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.695
But I do know
he didn't kill anyone.

16:02.729 --> 16:03.963
So why would he run?

16:03.997 --> 16:06.266
Because he knew
the moment you would
find out about his record,

16:06.299 --> 16:08.301
all you would see
is an ex-con.

16:08.335 --> 16:11.038
Gabrielle, your dad
is a convicted murderer.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.240
I don't know
that person,
detective.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.541
My father found out
about me

16:14.574 --> 16:16.709
after my mother died.

16:16.743 --> 16:17.844
I went to see him in prison.

16:17.877 --> 16:21.014
That's why he got clean
and he started going to school.

16:21.048 --> 16:23.283
STABLER:
So now he's a saint.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.485
He wrote to me every day.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.487
After he got out,
he worked his ass off

16:27.520 --> 16:29.689
so that we can have a good life.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.491
He made a stupid mistake
when he was a kid,

16:31.524 --> 16:32.725
and he paid for it.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.028
Murder is not a stupid
mistake, Gabrielle.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.363
He was
a different person

16:36.396 --> 16:37.430
when he was high.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.698
He's been clean
for 16 years.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.533
But you don't care
about that, do you?

16:40.567 --> 16:41.701
You want to know
what we care about?

16:41.734 --> 16:43.203
We care about the truth.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.805
And if your father
didn't kill Rebecca Wheeler,

16:45.838 --> 16:48.441
then we need to find him
so we can clear him.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.145
I'm a law student,
Detective.

16:52.179 --> 16:55.048
I know how cops lie
to get information.

16:55.082 --> 16:58.618
Even if I knew where he was,
I wouldn't tell you.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.421
Maybe your colleagues will be
a little more cooperative.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.123
Listen up.
Has anyone seen this man?

17:03.156 --> 17:04.124
Name is Javier Vega.

17:04.157 --> 17:06.226
Bastard.

17:07.627 --> 17:08.761
Search all you want,

17:08.795 --> 17:10.163
He left the country.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.533
STABLER:
Gabrielle's lying.

17:13.566 --> 17:14.534
She loves her dad.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.269
She's not going to give him up.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.771
She says he left the country,
and thinks what,

17:18.805 --> 17:20.140
we'll just stop looking?

17:20.173 --> 17:22.175
No reports of him
at the Canadian border,

17:22.209 --> 17:23.776
he's not on any
passenger manifests

17:23.810 --> 17:25.345
for flights leaving
the tri-state.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.314
My gut, he's still in the city.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.316
Why the hell would he stay here
when he knows

17:29.349 --> 17:30.217
we're looking for him?

17:30.250 --> 17:32.285
Because he and Gabrielle
seem pretty tight.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.187
Probably didn't want
to leave her behind.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.222
You think she'd
he dumb enough

17:35.255 --> 17:36.289
to hide her father?

17:36.323 --> 17:38.691
I think she would do anything
to protect her father.

17:38.725 --> 17:39.759
Then she's an accessory.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.428
Bring her in.
I'll talk to her myself.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.296
You sure
that's a good idea?

17:45.865 --> 17:48.568
There something you
wanna say to me?

17:48.601 --> 17:51.404
Just that you seem
a little involved.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.173
Vega raped
and murdered

17:53.206 --> 17:54.441
an innocent young woman.

17:54.474 --> 17:55.675
Of course I'm involved.

17:55.708 --> 17:56.676
BENSON:
Captain,

17:56.709 --> 18:00.113
sector car out in Queens
just spotted Vega's car.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.148
Vega driving?

18:01.181 --> 18:02.182
No sign of him.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.850
STABLER:
Captain, we can handle it.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.685
So can I.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.857
Engine's cold.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.192
Nothing.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.129
( sniffs )

18:16.163 --> 18:17.197
He was traveling
with an older woman.

18:17.230 --> 18:17.830
How you get that?

18:17.864 --> 18:18.831
Take a whiff.

18:18.865 --> 18:19.799
Lilies and roses.

18:19.832 --> 18:22.402
No woman one under 60
wears this perfume.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.204
Maybe Gabrielle has
old-fashioned taste.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.205
Gabrielle wears

18:25.238 --> 18:26.839
sandalwood and bergamot.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.143
Women notice these things.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.144
You notice that?

18:31.178 --> 18:32.145
STABLER:
What?

18:32.179 --> 18:33.913
Bus stop.

18:33.946 --> 18:34.847
You're thinking Vega
dumped the car

18:34.881 --> 18:36.349
and hopped the bus
with his lady friend?

18:36.383 --> 18:38.451
You live in Queens.
Where's this bus go?

18:38.485 --> 18:39.686
No idea. Let's find out.

18:39.719 --> 18:43.523
We go right on Van Dam
along 48th Avenue
to Sunnyside,

18:43.556 --> 18:46.226
then cut through
the cemeteries to Maspeth.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.227
Cemeteries.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.428
Queens is lousy
with 'em.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.562
Can I borrow
your newspaper?

18:49.596 --> 18:51.331
There you go.

18:51.364 --> 18:54.434
Roses and lilies.
It's not perfume,
it's flowers.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.935
Where's he going
with them?

18:55.968 --> 18:59.572
Rebecca's funeral was this
morning-- Avondale Cemetery.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.641
He's going
to Rebecca's grave.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.176
Thank you.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.348
BENSON:
Javier Vega.

19:08.381 --> 19:11.150
Don't move.
Now, stand up.

19:16.223 --> 19:17.357
Passport.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.926
Been a long time, Vega.

19:23.263 --> 19:24.464
Do I know you?

19:24.497 --> 19:26.333
It'll come back to you.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.935
Javier Vega, you are under
arrest for the murder

19:28.968 --> 19:29.802
of Rebecca Wheeler.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.571
You have the right
to remain silent.

19:31.604 --> 19:32.805
If you give up
that right,

19:32.839 --> 19:33.906
anything you say

19:33.940 --> 19:35.908
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.588
Cragen.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.557
I should've known
you were behind this.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.225
You put yourself in the jackpot.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.393
I didn't kill Rebecca.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.427
But you ran.

19:54.461 --> 19:56.229
What choice did I have?

19:56.263 --> 19:58.998
The minute your cops heard
I was an ex-con,

19:59.031 --> 20:02.269
I went from professor
to cold-blooded murderer.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.704
You are a cold-blooded murderer.
You killed Joanna Lewis.

20:04.737 --> 20:05.838
30 years ago.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.440
Not this time.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.676
Somebody's setting me up.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.844
He must know you
pretty well.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.314
Rebecca was strangled
by a lefty,

20:14.347 --> 20:16.783
raped using your brand
of condoms

20:16.816 --> 20:17.950
and dumped by a
man driving your car.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.586
Same M.O., same perp.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.421
I spent the last 20 years
studying crime.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.555
If I was going to kill somebody,

20:22.589 --> 20:24.657
don't you think I'd cover
my tracks a little better?

20:24.691 --> 20:27.294
You tried.

20:27.327 --> 20:30.863
Why would I kill Rebecca?

20:30.897 --> 20:32.565
I loved her,

20:32.599 --> 20:33.933
she loved me.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.969
We were going
to be married.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.271
Wake up.

20:38.305 --> 20:39.439
She was so terrified of you

20:39.472 --> 20:40.673
she was going
to change advisors.

20:40.707 --> 20:41.541
I told her to.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.776
A student sleeping with
her professor

20:43.810 --> 20:45.912
looks bad to everybody.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.780
We were protecting our careers.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.949
Then why was she trying
to end yours?

20:49.982 --> 20:53.019
We lifted her prints
off a letter to Dean Busch

20:53.052 --> 20:54.587
outing you as a murderer.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.926
She couldn't have written that.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.594
Then how'd her prints
get all over it?

21:01.628 --> 21:02.595
You tell me.

21:02.629 --> 21:03.963
She had no reason

21:03.996 --> 21:04.964
to write that,

21:04.997 --> 21:06.032
and I had no reason to kill her.

21:06.065 --> 21:08.401
I told her everything
about my past months ago.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.042
I remember you, Vega.

21:16.075 --> 21:18.978
When I collared you
after we found

21:19.011 --> 21:21.914
that poor woman's
stinking corpse,

21:21.948 --> 21:23.983
you cried like a baby.

21:24.016 --> 21:27.887
You denied it then,
but we had your prints
all over that oil drum.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.022
You lied then
like you're lying now.

21:30.056 --> 21:32.825
I will never forget what
I did to Joanna Lewis.

21:32.859 --> 21:35.395
Her face will haunt me
until the day I die,

21:35.428 --> 21:36.796
but my past is my past.

21:36.829 --> 21:39.031
I'm a different man now.

21:39.065 --> 21:40.367
Just like you.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.835
Yeah, yeah, I remember you.

21:42.869 --> 21:44.371
You were a drunk.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.339
The stench of booze

21:46.373 --> 21:47.740
was all over you.

21:47.774 --> 21:51.578
But you changed,
didn't you, Captain?

21:51.611 --> 21:54.781
You think you're
the only one who can.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.861
All right. I'm listening.

22:08.895 --> 22:12.765
I was at Rebecca's
the night she died.

22:12.799 --> 22:15.535
When I left she was alive.

22:15.568 --> 22:18.871
20 years studying crime,
and that's the best you can do?

22:18.905 --> 22:19.872
Ask Rudy Lemcke.

22:19.906 --> 22:22.375
He was at Rebecca's that night.

22:22.409 --> 22:24.811
I dropped him off
at the Lydia Motel

22:24.844 --> 22:26.546
to crash for the night.

22:26.579 --> 22:29.749
Rudy will tell you--
when we left Rebecca's

22:29.782 --> 22:30.850
she was alive.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.123
STABLER:
Vega's lying through his teeth.

22:37.156 --> 22:40.927
Nobody at the Lydia Motel
remembers seeing him or Rudy.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.429
I should've known.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.864
Why the hell did I even
listen to him?

22:44.897 --> 22:46.132
We got to find Rudy,

22:46.165 --> 22:47.700
shoot some holes
in Vega's alibi.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.135
Elliot, you checked
the homeless shelter

22:49.168 --> 22:50.202
where Rudy was staying?

22:50.236 --> 22:52.572
No one's seen or heard
from Rudy since we busted him.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.173
BENSON:
Fin put the word
out on the street.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.543
Every crackhead and dealer
knows we're looking for him.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.711
So all the evidence
we have against Vega
is circumstantial.

22:58.745 --> 23:01.180
We've have the fiber and
the condom from inside Rebecca

23:01.213 --> 23:02.915
that proves Vega was
the murder.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.817
We've got means, motive,
opportunity...

23:04.851 --> 23:06.519
And the fact that he strangled
another woman

23:06.553 --> 23:07.987
exactly the same way
30 years ago.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.456
NOVAK:
That's only admissible

23:09.489 --> 23:10.690
if Judge Petrovsky allows me

23:10.723 --> 23:12.191
to bring up
Vega's prior bad acts.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.426
It proves an M.O.

23:13.460 --> 23:14.927
Shouldn't be
a problem for you.

23:14.961 --> 23:16.429
I'm not saying
I can't win.

23:16.463 --> 23:17.697
I just wish
I had Rudy Lemcke.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.467
You will.

23:23.536 --> 23:26.038
Can I talk to you a minute?

23:26.072 --> 23:27.173
Is there a problem?

23:27.206 --> 23:28.174
Vega's priors.

23:28.207 --> 23:30.142
June, 1975, grand theft auto.

23:30.176 --> 23:33.480
He got probation
because his arresting officer

23:33.513 --> 23:35.782
recommended leniency
to the D.A.

23:35.815 --> 23:36.916
It was you.

23:36.949 --> 23:38.084
Why'd you do it?

23:38.117 --> 23:39.886
He was a kid.
He was high.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.754
When he came down
he seemed serious

23:41.788 --> 23:42.789
about cleaning up his act.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.023
Except he wasn't.

23:44.056 --> 23:47.460
He got high again and killed
Joanna Lewis while on probation.

23:47.494 --> 23:49.462
What does this have to do
with Rebecca Wheeler?

23:49.496 --> 23:50.463
Vega's already

23:50.497 --> 23:51.464
crying frame job.

23:51.498 --> 23:52.532
You two have history.

23:52.565 --> 23:55.201
I just need you to tell me
there's nothing personal

23:55.234 --> 23:56.202
going on here.

23:56.235 --> 23:58.838
All I want is for
the bastard to rot in jail

23:58.871 --> 24:02.008
because the evidence points
to him, because he's guilty.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.583
Yes, I killed Joanna Lewis.

24:10.617 --> 24:13.520
I was a 19-year-old
heroin addict.

24:13.553 --> 24:15.888
I didn't know what I was doing.

24:15.922 --> 24:18.725
I went to prison
and served my time.

24:18.758 --> 24:20.727
For the last seven years

24:20.760 --> 24:24.163
you've donated $500
a month to what cause?

24:24.196 --> 24:26.666
The Joanna Lewis memorial fund.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.735
Did the court order you
to make restitution?

24:28.768 --> 24:32.972
No. But it's
the right thing to do.

24:33.005 --> 24:34.807
So you've paid your debt
to society

24:34.841 --> 24:35.975
by serving your sentence,

24:36.008 --> 24:39.078
and now you're paying a debt
to your victim's families.

24:39.111 --> 24:40.112
Tell us, Professor,

24:40.146 --> 24:42.148
why do you teach
criminology?

24:42.181 --> 24:43.850
To atone for
what I did.

24:43.883 --> 24:45.051
I hope I can use

24:45.084 --> 24:48.688
my mistakes to teach
others to prevent crime.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.723
Like you taught Rebecca Wheeler?

24:50.757 --> 24:52.759
Yes. She was
a brilliant student,

24:52.792 --> 24:54.060
and a generous woman.

24:54.093 --> 24:56.195
That's why I fell in love
with her.

24:56.228 --> 24:58.698
That's why I could never
have killed her.

24:58.731 --> 25:01.233
Thank you.
Nothing further.

25:10.276 --> 25:12.011
Do you recognize
this photograph?

25:12.044 --> 25:13.312
No.

25:13.345 --> 25:16.949
This is Joanna Lewis's
neck after you raped

25:16.983 --> 25:20.753
and strangled her in 1976.

25:20.787 --> 25:22.154
I never raped her.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.691
But you did
kill her, didn't you?

25:24.724 --> 25:26.626
Yes.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.096
NOVAK:
What about this?

25:32.699 --> 25:34.100
I don't recognize that.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.235
This is
Rebecca Wheeler's neck.

25:36.268 --> 25:38.204
They look the same,
don't they?

25:38.237 --> 25:39.672
I didn't kill Rebecca.

25:39.706 --> 25:40.740
This is a fragment

25:40.773 --> 25:43.242
of a condom recovered from
inside Rebecca Wheeler.

25:43.275 --> 25:46.178
The same brand of condoms
was found at your apartment.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.615
This is a fiber recovered

25:48.648 --> 25:49.816
from Rebecca's trachea.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.951
Your coat is made from
the same material.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.319
And do you recognize this?

25:53.352 --> 25:55.788
It's the letter Rebecca wrote
to the University

25:55.822 --> 25:57.323
demanding that you be fired.

25:57.356 --> 25:58.825
Rebecca didn't write
that letter.

25:58.858 --> 25:59.859
Her prints are on it.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.261
So if she didn't
write it, who did?

26:02.294 --> 26:05.197
Why don't you ask the cops?

26:06.733 --> 26:09.836
Are you implying that
the police planted evidence?

26:09.869 --> 26:11.938
It wouldn't be
the first time.

26:11.971 --> 26:14.841
So the police knew
your brand of condom

26:14.874 --> 26:19.245
took a fragment and placed it
inside Rebecca.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.748
Then they took a fiber
from your coat

26:21.781 --> 26:23.182
and jammed it down her throat?

26:23.215 --> 26:24.216
Yes.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.384
You're an
intelligent man,

26:25.417 --> 26:28.187
Professor.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.289
Isn't the most logical
explanation

26:30.322 --> 26:31.691
that you killed Rebecca?

26:31.724 --> 26:33.259
I didn't kill her.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.361
I did not kill her!

26:54.046 --> 26:56.282
Jury took less
than an hour.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.184
Guilty on all counts.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.319
That's my kind of jury.

27:00.352 --> 27:01.220
Detectives?

27:01.253 --> 27:03.422
Is it true you're looking
for Rudy Lemcke?

27:03.455 --> 27:04.657
BENSON:
We were.

27:04.691 --> 27:05.658
Trial's over.

27:05.692 --> 27:07.293
Why, do you know where he is?

27:07.326 --> 27:08.661
Maybe.

27:08.695 --> 27:10.029
You want to arrest him?

27:10.062 --> 27:11.698
No, he was
an alibi witness.

27:11.731 --> 27:12.865
Where is he, Sister?

27:12.899 --> 27:13.866
Hiding from you.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.334
When you interrogated him

27:15.367 --> 27:17.203
you pushed him over the edge.

27:17.236 --> 27:19.071
He didn't deserve that.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.873
He was a suspect
in a murder case.

27:20.907 --> 27:21.908
He was innocent.

27:21.941 --> 27:22.942
Now he's terrified.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.712
You've been telling
every drug dealer in town

27:25.745 --> 27:27.113
you're looking for him.

27:27.146 --> 27:28.247
They think he's a rat.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.448
We just wanted to talk to him.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.783
Well, he came
to me for help.

27:30.817 --> 27:33.252
He's afraid he's going
to get killed.

27:33.285 --> 27:36.122
We'll straighten things out
on the street

27:36.155 --> 27:37.223
after we talk to him.

27:37.256 --> 27:42.294
You give me your word
you're just going to talk...

27:42.328 --> 27:44.697
I'll take you to him.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.334
Professor ain't lying.
He gave me some money,

27:48.367 --> 27:50.369
then dropped me off at
a motel the night Rebecca died.

27:50.402 --> 27:51.437
BENSON:
What time?

27:51.470 --> 27:52.404
I don't got a watch.
Maybe 7:00.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.240
STABLER:
Well, we've got a
sushi delivery guy

27:54.273 --> 27:56.275
who puts you
at Rebecca's at 8:00 p.m.

27:56.308 --> 27:57.309
Okay, maybe it was

27:57.343 --> 27:58.310
10:00 maybe 9:00.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.346
Come on, Rudy,
you've got to think.

28:00.379 --> 28:03.115
Oh, it was definitely 9:00,
definitely 9:00,

28:03.149 --> 28:06.285
because that was right
after Rebecca and the Professor

28:06.318 --> 28:09.088
they finished
duking it out.

28:09.121 --> 28:10.823
So you heard them arguing?

28:10.857 --> 28:12.024
About me.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.826
Rebecca said I could crash
on her sofa.

28:13.860 --> 28:14.961
And then the Professor says

28:14.994 --> 28:16.228
no way he's going
to let a crackhead

28:16.262 --> 28:17.797
sleep on his girlfriend's couch.

28:17.830 --> 28:18.798
His girlfriend?

28:18.831 --> 28:19.999
Yeah, you know
they were

28:20.032 --> 28:21.133
lovey dovey.

28:21.167 --> 28:22.334
They were going
to get married.

28:22.368 --> 28:23.302
You're sure about that?

28:23.335 --> 28:25.204
Well, maybe not. I don't know.

28:25.237 --> 28:26.973
Rudy, this is important.

28:27.006 --> 28:29.041
BENSON:
Rudy, Rudy, listen to me.

28:29.075 --> 28:30.877
Who told you that
they were getting married?

28:30.910 --> 28:35.047
Um, Rebecca. Yeah.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.517
Think.

28:38.550 --> 28:44.356
What time did the Professor
drop you off at that motel?

28:44.390 --> 28:47.426
I don't know, man.

28:50.129 --> 28:52.298
But I do remember that

28:52.331 --> 28:56.402
it stopped raining
on our way over there.

28:56.435 --> 28:58.037
Checked with
the Weather Service.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.138
Rain stopped at 9:22 p.m.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.874
You know, it's possible
that Vega dropped Rudy off,

29:01.908 --> 29:03.776
and then came back
and killed Rebecca.

29:03.810 --> 29:04.877
It's more than possible.

29:04.911 --> 29:07.780
Neighbor saw Vega's car in front
of Rebecca's at 11:30.

29:07.814 --> 29:09.882
So, Vega was telling
the truth about Rudy.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.884
He'll use that
to appeal his conviction.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.886
I don't want Vega wriggling out
of this.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.121
Go back to the neighbor.

29:15.154 --> 29:17.089
See exactly what time
he saw that car.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.829
I told the other detectives.
It was 11:30.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.096
And you're sure
about that?

29:24.130 --> 29:25.131
Positive.

29:25.164 --> 29:26.532
The Simpsons just ended.

29:26.565 --> 29:29.168
I got up to close my window
before I went to sleep.

29:29.201 --> 29:30.569
That's my apartment right there.

29:30.602 --> 29:31.871
I seen a guy in a coat

29:31.904 --> 29:33.372
put this big-ass bundle
in a Lexus.

29:33.405 --> 29:34.841
He was parked right there.

29:37.543 --> 29:39.278
Vega doubled back.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.581
BENSON:
See that guy just

29:42.614 --> 29:45.151
blew through
the intersection.

29:45.184 --> 29:48.154
Red-light cam caught
the whole thing.

29:48.187 --> 29:50.823
Maybe it caught Vega, too.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.426
MAN:
City's making a bundle.

29:54.460 --> 29:57.263
Lot of people
run that light.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.065
We got one at 7:46,

29:59.098 --> 30:02.234
8:03, 8:40.

30:02.268 --> 30:03.235
That's Vega's car.

30:03.269 --> 30:05.004
the white Lexus.

30:05.037 --> 30:06.605
Next photo's 9:02.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.407
And the car's
gone.

30:08.440 --> 30:11.477
That's when Vega said he took
Rudy to that motel.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.145
What time does he come back?

30:14.246 --> 30:17.249
The Lexus returns

30:17.283 --> 30:18.918
at 11:07.

30:18.951 --> 30:20.887
So Vega returned
to murder Rebecca.

30:20.920 --> 30:21.921
Blow that up.

30:21.954 --> 30:23.222
Show me that license plate.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.624
Enhancing...

30:25.657 --> 30:27.293
STABLER:
JMM 8120.

30:27.326 --> 30:30.229
BENSON:
Let's double check.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.198
Bring up one
of the earlier photos.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.335
MAL 5047...

30:36.368 --> 30:37.937
We got

30:37.970 --> 30:40.139
two different cars.

30:43.442 --> 30:44.310
It's a Lexus RX.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.278
DMV has it registered
to this agency.

30:46.312 --> 30:47.413
We're looking for
who rented it

30:47.446 --> 30:48.614
on the night
of February 20.

30:48.647 --> 30:49.481
Here you go--

30:49.515 --> 30:52.384
rental agreement
and renter information.

30:52.418 --> 30:54.887
Well, first of all,
the license is fake.

30:54.921 --> 30:57.523
New York driver's licenses
have all numbers.

30:57.556 --> 31:00.326
This has three letters--
and you can't even

31:00.359 --> 31:01.593
make out the picture.

31:01.627 --> 31:02.461
I'm sorry.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.897
I don't know how
this could've happened.

31:04.931 --> 31:05.932
STABLER:
Yeah, I bet.

31:05.965 --> 31:09.001
You don't want us
to bust you for renting cars

31:09.035 --> 31:11.103
to unlicensed drivers, do you?

31:11.137 --> 31:13.172
Maybe we can work something out.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.540
STABLER:
We're listening.

31:14.573 --> 31:16.909
We put GPS trackers
on the deluxe models

31:16.943 --> 31:18.210
in case they're stolen.

31:18.244 --> 31:19.445
That way we can find 'em.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.413
How long do you keep
those records?

31:21.447 --> 31:22.414
Six months.

31:22.448 --> 31:24.316
Show us the location
of the car

31:24.350 --> 31:26.085
the night
of February 20.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.320
This is where

31:28.354 --> 31:29.655
we are.

31:29.688 --> 31:32.458
He took Houston
to the West Side Highway,

31:32.491 --> 31:34.293
got off at 96th Street,

31:34.326 --> 31:35.461
over to Claremont and 107th.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.029
That's Rebecca's apartment.

31:37.063 --> 31:39.365
And from Rebecca's apartment
right into Central Park

31:39.398 --> 31:40.599
where her body was found.

31:40.632 --> 31:42.935
We need to know where
that car is right now.

31:42.969 --> 31:45.237
Whoever rented that car
killed Rebecca Wheeler.

31:45.271 --> 31:48.274
And an innocent man's
in prison.

31:52.979 --> 31:53.812
Somebody went
to a whole lot of trouble

31:54.646 --> 31:56.182
to frame Vega
for Rebecca's murder.

31:56.215 --> 31:57.383
And I bought it.

31:57.416 --> 31:58.617
And you weren't the one
who set him up.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.586
But I was the one
who made him a suspect.

32:00.619 --> 32:01.988
He was a convicted murderer.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.522
All the evidence pointed to him.

32:03.555 --> 32:04.523
Not to mention he ran.

32:04.556 --> 32:05.624
What were we supposed to think?

32:05.657 --> 32:07.293
Get the rental car
over to the lab.

32:07.326 --> 32:11.130
Have them tear it apart.
I'll talk to Vega.

32:11.163 --> 32:12.131
A mistake?!

32:12.164 --> 32:14.233
That's the best
you can say?!

32:14.266 --> 32:16.202
"We made a mistake"?!

32:16.235 --> 32:18.604
I'm sorry.
I'll talk to the ADA.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.706
Get you out of here
right away.

32:21.673 --> 32:23.976
My hero.

32:25.377 --> 32:26.745
I want to make
things right.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.314
There's nothing you can do.

32:28.347 --> 32:29.448
I can try.

32:29.481 --> 32:31.250
Can you bring Rebecca
back to life?

32:31.283 --> 32:33.986
Can you give me back my career?

32:36.488 --> 32:38.057
Get out of my face.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.691
You're using again.

32:39.725 --> 32:42.028
Not even trying to hide it.

32:42.061 --> 32:43.562
It makes the time
go quicker.

32:43.595 --> 32:46.365
You need to get clean.
I can get you help.

32:48.334 --> 32:50.336
Your help put me here.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.506
You change your mind,
you know where to find me.

32:54.540 --> 32:55.574
On the gate.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.677
Who killed Rebecca?

32:58.710 --> 33:00.746
Somebody who wanted
to hurt you.

33:00.779 --> 33:02.781
Any ideas?

33:02.814 --> 33:04.650
Besides the NYPD? No.

33:07.053 --> 33:10.222
So this guy rented a car
like mine?

33:10.256 --> 33:11.790
Yeah.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.192
Where from?

33:13.225 --> 33:15.727
A place on Houston.

33:15.761 --> 33:19.531
I'll keep you posted.

33:19.565 --> 33:21.533
I won't hold my breath.

33:23.069 --> 33:25.504
Captain, you should've
told me you were coming.

33:25.537 --> 33:26.638
I would've tidied up.

33:26.672 --> 33:27.706
When is Vega getting out?

33:27.739 --> 33:28.807
I'm on my way
to court now.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.642
We'll have him
released first thing
tomorrow morning.

33:30.676 --> 33:32.711
It's not soon enough.
We need to do it now.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.146
Why, is he in
some sort of danger?

33:34.180 --> 33:36.248
Just from himself.
He's using again.

33:36.282 --> 33:37.316
Not much I can do.

33:37.349 --> 33:40.319
Rikers can't qet him down
to court till morning.

33:40.719 --> 33:41.787
I'll call in a favor,

33:41.820 --> 33:43.689
have Vega produced
by the end of business

33:43.722 --> 33:46.392
if you can get your motion
on the calendar by then.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.560
Yeah, okay.

33:49.728 --> 33:50.562
You know,

33:50.596 --> 33:51.497
this isn't your fault.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.599
We'll have to agree
to disagree on that one.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.601
You didn't put the needle
in Vega's arm.

33:55.634 --> 33:56.502
No, I just torpedoed
his career

33:56.535 --> 33:58.404
and locked him up
with a bunch of junkies.

33:58.437 --> 33:59.738
You were doing your job.

33:59.771 --> 34:02.741
Maybe the brass
will give me a medal.

34:05.211 --> 34:06.645
In light of this evidence,

34:06.678 --> 34:09.115
the People and the Defense
are filing jointly

34:09.148 --> 34:11.417
to dismiss all charges
against Professor Vega.

34:11.450 --> 34:13.385
Anything you'd like to add,
Mr. Seaver?

34:13.419 --> 34:14.453
Just how pleased we are

34:14.486 --> 34:16.122
that the People recognize
the error of their ways.

34:16.155 --> 34:17.789
Duly noted.

34:17.823 --> 34:19.625
The Court hereby grants
the motion

34:19.658 --> 34:22.328
to set aside the conviction
of Professor Vega

34:22.361 --> 34:23.695
in the interests of justice.

34:23.729 --> 34:26.765
You're free to go,
with the Court's apologies.

34:28.467 --> 34:30.068
( gavel bangs )

34:39.611 --> 34:40.879
Any leads yet?

34:40.912 --> 34:42.781
We're working on it.

34:46.252 --> 34:47.453
Do you own a home, Captain?

34:47.486 --> 34:48.620
I'm sorry?

34:48.654 --> 34:50.756
A home. Stocks.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.591
Any assets that
we should know about?

34:52.624 --> 34:54.293
Consider yourself served.

34:54.326 --> 34:55.894
We're going
after the City,

34:55.927 --> 34:58.564
the police department,
and you, sir.

34:58.597 --> 35:02.768
We're seeking $12 million
compensatory damages.

35:04.770 --> 35:07.173
You want to go out
the back way?

35:08.807 --> 35:10.409
No.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.319
( reporters clamoring )

35:24.790 --> 35:26.325
Been working on the car
two hours now.

35:26.358 --> 35:27.426
Dusted every surface.
No prints.

35:27.459 --> 35:28.427
They check the rearview?

35:28.460 --> 35:29.328
Yep. Nothing.

35:29.361 --> 35:31.230
What about the seat-
adjustment button?

35:31.263 --> 35:33.465
A lot of times
perps wipe down
everything else,

35:33.499 --> 35:34.466
forget they moved the seat.

35:34.500 --> 35:37.336
We've done this
a couple times
before, Captain.

35:37.369 --> 35:38.704
Hold on.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.639
Nail clippers.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.508
Is that a fingernail clipping?

35:42.541 --> 35:43.909
With red nail polish.

35:43.942 --> 35:45.677
Same color as Rebecca's.

35:45.711 --> 35:47.579
Let's see if we have a latent.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.849
I think we got something.

35:50.882 --> 35:53.552
CRAGEN:
Judy, how much longer?

35:53.585 --> 35:55.787
Done. Your guy doesn't have
a criminal record.

35:55.821 --> 35:56.788
Sorry, Captain.

35:56.822 --> 35:58.390
Expand the search.

35:58.424 --> 36:01.727
Guy who did this
had to know Vega and Rebecca.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.563
Run prison guards, cops,
anybody who works

36:04.596 --> 36:06.598
in the criminal justice system.

36:13.572 --> 36:14.440
You got something?

36:14.473 --> 36:15.507
Computer doesn't make
the final match,

36:15.541 --> 36:17.576
I do.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.611
Same ridge line,
identical whorl.

36:19.645 --> 36:22.214
It's only a seven-point match,
but...

36:22.248 --> 36:23.215
Whose?

36:23.249 --> 36:25.751
Student intern-- Probation.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.753
Worked there summer 2003.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.688
Name's Kyle Luhrmann.

36:31.490 --> 36:32.624
( loud rock playing )

36:39.698 --> 36:41.800
Bastard's gone.

36:41.833 --> 36:45.471
Didn't even have time
to finish his coffee.

36:47.473 --> 36:48.907
Captain, take a look at these.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.009
What is it?

36:51.042 --> 36:54.012
Pictures-- all of them of Vega.

36:54.045 --> 36:58.684
With Rebecca getting
into his car, wearing his coat.

36:58.717 --> 37:01.420
Luhrmann was stalking the guy.

37:01.453 --> 37:02.821
He got pictures
of Vega's condoms, too?

37:04.690 --> 37:06.292
He wouldn't need to.

37:06.325 --> 37:08.760
Vega used to invite his students
over to his apartment

37:08.794 --> 37:09.895
once a week for drinks.

37:09.928 --> 37:12.698
Luhrmann could have found them
just snooping around.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.566
And Luhrmann worked
with Rebecca.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.469
Easy to steal a blank piece
of paper with her prints on it,

37:17.503 --> 37:18.470
forge the letter.

37:18.504 --> 37:19.538
Where is the
son of a bitch?

37:19.571 --> 37:21.707
Once he heard that Vega
had been cleared, he'd run.

37:21.740 --> 37:25.010
And so fast,
he forgot his coat and scarf.

37:30.516 --> 37:31.750
Anybody spots Luhrmann,

37:31.783 --> 37:33.519
I want to be the first
on scene.

37:33.552 --> 37:35.487
Captain Cragen,
I have to talk to you, sir.

37:35.521 --> 37:37.723
I can't.

37:37.756 --> 37:40.692
You have
to help him.

37:40.726 --> 37:41.760
You and your father
are suing me.

37:41.793 --> 37:43.695
I can't talk to you
without my attorney present.

37:43.729 --> 37:46.732
Please? He left this
note for me.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.935
I think he's going
to kill himself.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.970
You got to read this.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.675
"I can't ask you
to save me again,

37:56.708 --> 37:58.444
"and I can't save myself.

37:58.477 --> 37:59.545
"I've made my bed,

37:59.578 --> 38:01.046
now it's time for me
to lie down."

38:01.079 --> 38:02.047
He's suicidal.

38:02.080 --> 38:02.981
He's homicidal, too.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.983
"I hope you can forgive me
one final sin

38:05.016 --> 38:06.418
in the name of justice."

38:06.452 --> 38:07.686
He's looking to get even.

38:07.719 --> 38:09.054
Think he's going
to come after you?

38:09.087 --> 38:10.422
Hold on a second.

38:10.456 --> 38:11.723
He's talking
about Rebecca.

38:11.757 --> 38:14.693
"Not justice for me,
but for the woman I loved."

38:14.726 --> 38:16.562
Luhrmann didn't leave
in a hurry.

38:16.595 --> 38:17.696
Vega kidnapped him.

38:17.729 --> 38:18.797
How'd he figure out

38:18.830 --> 38:20.466
that Luhrmann
killed Rebecca?

38:20.499 --> 38:22.401
Son of a bitch.

38:22.434 --> 38:23.268
He asked me where

38:23.301 --> 38:25.504
the car was rented from
and I told him.

38:27.005 --> 38:29.741
The rental agency
is only two blocks

38:29.775 --> 38:31.076
from the Sociology library

38:31.109 --> 38:32.678
where Luhrmann hangs out.

38:32.711 --> 38:33.679
Vega put it together.

38:33.712 --> 38:35.581
So why not just kill him?

38:35.614 --> 38:37.749
Vega wants him to suffer the way
Luhrmann made Rebecca suffer.

38:37.783 --> 38:39.718
Okay, so where'd he take him?

38:39.751 --> 38:42.120
Some place that's emotionally
significant.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.122
Rebecca's apartment,
Wallace University...

38:44.155 --> 38:45.123
Too many people
around.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.725
Avondale Cemetery?

38:46.758 --> 38:47.726
He would never
desecrate

38:47.759 --> 38:48.760
Rebecca's grave...

38:48.794 --> 38:50.596
But Central Park,

38:50.629 --> 38:54.065
where he left Rebecca's body
to rot.

38:54.099 --> 38:55.200
Call ESU.

38:55.233 --> 38:58.737
Tell them to set up a perimeter
around the murder scene.

38:58.770 --> 38:59.771
I'm on my way.

39:01.873 --> 39:03.642
Vega's got a gun
to Luhrmann's head.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.011
He's using him as a shield
so we can't get a clear shot.

39:06.044 --> 39:07.012
Is Vega talking?

39:07.045 --> 39:08.647
Just to Luhrmann.
The line of fire
is that tree

39:08.680 --> 39:10.616
to that rock.

39:10.649 --> 39:11.883
Got it.

39:16.688 --> 39:17.656
( siren wailing )

39:17.689 --> 39:20.592
OFFICER ( over radio ):
SWAT team leader

39:20.626 --> 39:22.428
to Alpha Team: Into position.

39:26.932 --> 39:29.601
Alpha Leader to SWAT Leader:
10-4.

39:29.635 --> 39:31.036
You gotta help me!

39:31.069 --> 39:32.037
He's crazy!

39:32.070 --> 39:33.739
He's gonna kill me.

39:33.772 --> 39:35.607
I don't blame him.

39:35.641 --> 39:36.775
But let him go, Vega.

39:36.808 --> 39:37.776
He killed Rebecca!

39:37.809 --> 39:39.110
I didn't do anything
to her,

39:39.144 --> 39:40.111
I swear!

39:40.145 --> 39:41.112
Tell him what you did

39:41.146 --> 39:42.614
or I'll blow
your head off!

39:43.982 --> 39:47.018
All right.

39:47.052 --> 39:49.421
I killed her.

39:49.455 --> 39:50.789
Why?

39:53.792 --> 39:55.627
What'd she do to you?

39:55.661 --> 39:56.728
I loved her,

39:56.762 --> 40:00.098
but she told me
she was marrying you.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.670
I went to her apartment,

40:04.703 --> 40:06.505
gave her one last chance.

40:08.607 --> 40:09.975
She blew it.

40:10.008 --> 40:11.009
You're dead.

40:11.042 --> 40:12.778
Put the gun down.

40:12.811 --> 40:14.646
You got your confession.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.214
You shoot him, you're dead.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.817
You kill him,
you lose your daughter, too.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.786
Gabrielle's better off
without me.

40:20.819 --> 40:21.887
She came to see me.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.789
She begged me to bring you home.

40:23.822 --> 40:26.825
The only way I'm leaving
here is in a body bag.

40:26.858 --> 40:28.093
Not if you let him live.

40:28.126 --> 40:29.761
He confessed to murder.

40:29.795 --> 40:31.763
He's finished.

40:31.797 --> 40:34.733
Let me help you.

40:34.766 --> 40:35.901
Nobody can help me.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.136
You're still thinking
like a junkie.

40:38.169 --> 40:41.907
Fine. Go ahead, kill him.

40:41.940 --> 40:45.110
Show me
you're still a murderer too.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.619
( sobbing )

41:01.159 --> 41:02.661
OFFICER:
Gun!

41:13.639 --> 41:15.106
OFFICER: ( over radio )
Swat leader to all teams.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.207
Stand down. We are code four.

41:32.057 --> 41:33.258
Let's go see
your daughter.
