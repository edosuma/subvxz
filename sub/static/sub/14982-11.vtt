WEBVTT

00:11.505 --> 00:13.577
I'm a paramedic.
My name's Ilene.

00:13.677 --> 00:14.689
Are you in any pain?

00:16.350 --> 00:17.250
Scale of 1 to 10.

00:17.326 --> 00:18.526
It hurts to breathe.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.120
I'm okay, right?

00:20.320 --> 00:22.330
Try not to move.
You may have a rib fracture.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.349
I'll check on him now.

00:25.417 --> 00:26.951
Juan.

00:33.759 --> 00:36.093
Hey,
that's Juan Salazar, yo.

00:43.836 --> 00:46.237
You're going to help me
get her out of there. Come on.

00:51.944 --> 00:53.477
Can we wait till
help gets here?

00:53.545 --> 00:55.813
We are the help.
Everybody, back up.

00:55.881 --> 00:57.481
Aah! Oh!

00:57.549 --> 00:58.816
You're going
to pull her out.

00:58.884 --> 01:00.451
I need you to keep her
still and stable

01:00.519 --> 01:01.986
can you do that for me?

01:06.391 --> 01:08.693
It's ok. Ok.

01:08.744 --> 01:10.728
Steady. Breathe.

01:10.796 --> 01:12.780
Aah!

01:14.967 --> 01:17.168
Ok. I'm going to cut
the seat belt.

01:17.236 --> 01:18.569
When she falls,
catch her

01:18.604 --> 01:21.405
and guide her...

01:22.307 --> 01:25.309
Ok. Watch her spine.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.244
That's ok.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.547
Keep her spine supported.

01:31.049 --> 01:33.384
Gentle.
Support her.

01:35.587 --> 01:37.021
Go around her knees.

01:37.089 --> 01:38.472
On my count. Ready?

01:38.557 --> 01:40.224
1, 2, 3.

01:42.728 --> 01:44.428
Back up, now!

01:50.669 --> 01:53.103
SUV versus SUV
about a month ago.

01:53.155 --> 01:55.039
Cara Evans sustained
cracked ribs,

01:55.106 --> 01:56.941
a punctured lung,
and whiplash.

01:57.009 --> 01:59.443
Juan Salazar took
the brunt of the impact.

01:59.511 --> 02:00.678
Died instantly.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.747
Juan Salazar, he was
a baseball player.

02:02.814 --> 02:05.583
Best rookie pitcher
in the league.

02:05.651 --> 02:08.252
Donuts are going
like hotcakes.

02:08.320 --> 02:11.289
Oh?
I know that look.

02:11.356 --> 02:14.625
Assistant D.A. Jan Ottinger,
this is Dr. Cal Lightman.

02:14.693 --> 02:17.695
An assistant D.A. with no time
for small talk...

02:18.981 --> 02:21.265
Or donuts...

02:21.333 --> 02:24.035
Brings us
car crash footage.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.137
I smell a headline.

02:27.189 --> 02:30.041
3 guys were out joyriding
in that SUV.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.209
Fled the scene
unscathed.

02:32.277 --> 02:33.577
Vehicular
manslaughter?

02:33.645 --> 02:35.012
Try murder two.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.748
Really? Murder?

02:37.816 --> 02:39.317
Really.

02:43.789 --> 02:46.090
And while
the story's still hot,

02:46.158 --> 02:48.693
you want to know
which one was driving, huh.

02:48.760 --> 02:52.596
Well, we don't get kids
to rat out their mates

02:52.664 --> 02:54.015
just because you say so.

02:54.099 --> 02:55.933
It's a little more
complicated than that.

02:56.001 --> 02:59.537
Juan Salazar was a talented young man
cut down in his prime.

02:59.604 --> 03:02.073
Now, you wouldn't want
to stand in the way of justice,

03:02.140 --> 03:03.641
would you,
Dr. Lightman?

03:04.910 --> 03:08.346
Dr. Lightman?
What are you looking at?

03:08.413 --> 03:12.416
Hold the phone.
Stop the presses.

03:12.484 --> 03:15.386
Your headline's
about to change.

03:16.655 --> 03:19.390
That's guilt, that is.

03:52.290 --> 03:53.491
Those 2 guys pacing
can't look at that one.

03:53.558 --> 03:54.959
That's guilt,
and they're also--

03:55.027 --> 03:56.610
Yeah, that is guilt.
They stole a car,

03:56.695 --> 03:58.129
and they killed
somebody.

03:58.196 --> 04:01.132
- Can I finish?
- Yes.

04:01.199 --> 04:04.335
That's guilt for what they did
to Juan Salazar.

04:04.403 --> 04:06.570
And shame for what they're about
to do to their buddy.

04:06.638 --> 04:09.140
Each is waiting for
the other to go first.

04:15.147 --> 04:17.447
You two, out.

04:17.516 --> 04:19.416
You're Mark, right?

04:19.468 --> 04:21.851
Sit down.
I want to talk to you.

04:26.925 --> 04:28.692
Want to give up
your friends?

04:28.760 --> 04:31.595
You're not a rat,
are you?

04:31.663 --> 04:33.531
Which is more than I can say
about them.

04:33.598 --> 04:36.901
They were going to give you up,
if I hadn't jumped in.

04:36.968 --> 04:38.903
You think
I'm full of it?

04:38.970 --> 04:41.405
I see that, too.
Flared nostrils,

04:41.473 --> 04:43.074
eyes narrowed--

04:43.141 --> 04:46.177
all of which is
totally understandable.

04:46.244 --> 04:49.797
But if I'm so full of it,

04:49.881 --> 04:53.317
how come I know,
from their faces,

04:53.385 --> 04:55.219
that you were the one
driving the SUV?

04:57.355 --> 04:59.840
- Oh, you must be his lawyer.
- Yeah.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.125
- Public defender?
- Yeah.

05:01.193 --> 05:03.094
It's ok.
He didn't say anything...

05:03.161 --> 05:04.128
Verbally.

05:04.196 --> 05:08.299
And I'm not a cop,
actually.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.941
What do we got?
Banger versus Glock.

05:17.008 --> 05:18.442
GSW to the chest.

05:18.510 --> 05:19.844
Pulse is 140
and thready.

05:19.911 --> 05:22.696
BP's 60 over 30, decreased breath
sounds on the left.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.648
- Has he been responsive at all?
- I don't know.

05:24.716 --> 05:27.284
Ok, on my count,
1, 2, 3.

05:27.352 --> 05:29.887
Lois,
get ready for intubation.

05:29.955 --> 05:32.206
Doug, we're going to need
a chest tube.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.175
I'll see you
in the garage.

05:40.165 --> 05:43.400
- You're amazing.
- Thank you.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.402
You know, I thought
I'd get that bit out of the way.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.805
You're amazing
at what you do.

05:47.873 --> 05:49.306
Dr. Cal Lightman.

05:49.374 --> 05:51.909
Ilene Clarke.
You new here, doctor?

05:51.977 --> 05:53.644
No, I'm not that kind of doctor,
darling.

05:53.712 --> 05:54.979
You going
up or down?

05:55.046 --> 05:57.214
Down. "B."
Thank you.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:06.525 --> 06:08.626
Well, that's a bit
of a relief.

06:11.296 --> 06:13.130
No music.

06:17.235 --> 06:18.802
I suppose you might say
I'm the kind of doctor

06:18.870 --> 06:21.572
that's a bit of a pain
in the ass, really.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.407
Oh, yeah? Why?

06:23.475 --> 06:26.443
I poke about a bit.

06:29.347 --> 06:30.748
I'm afraid
you can't come in here.

06:30.815 --> 06:32.816
Oh, tell that
to the D.A.

06:32.884 --> 06:34.235
You work for
the D.A.'s office?

06:34.319 --> 06:35.853
I know.

06:35.921 --> 06:40.591
But in this economy,
one can't be too fussy.

06:40.659 --> 06:42.409
What can I do for you,
Dr. Lightman?

06:42.494 --> 06:43.761
Well, before
they lock a kid up

06:43.828 --> 06:45.062
for killing
a baseball star,

06:45.130 --> 06:47.298
thought I'd come here
and get your side of the story.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.732
Mine? Why?

06:48.800 --> 06:50.467
I don't know.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.403
Something
about your face...

06:52.470 --> 06:54.872
I think there's more to you
than meets the eye.

06:56.841 --> 06:59.276
I feel terrible about what happened
to Salazar

06:59.344 --> 07:00.744
and that kid
who killed him.

07:00.812 --> 07:02.913
Mark Jackson?
Is that his name?

07:02.981 --> 07:04.982
In the eyes
of the district,

07:05.050 --> 07:06.684
Mark Jackson's
an adult.

07:06.751 --> 07:08.018
So his life's
pretty much over.

07:08.086 --> 07:10.087
He'll do grown-up time.

07:10.155 --> 07:13.591
It was a terrible tragedy
for everyone involved.

07:13.658 --> 07:16.193
Yeah. Could have been worse,
though, you know,

07:16.261 --> 07:19.930
if you hadn't yanked that woman out
of the car before it blew up.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.432
I just do what I do.

07:21.499 --> 07:23.334
And ask questions
later.

07:25.036 --> 07:27.171
I heard that's pretty common
with people like you.

07:27.239 --> 07:29.323
People like me?

07:29.407 --> 07:32.610
Cops, firefighters,
soldiers.

07:32.677 --> 07:34.478
No shame in being proud,
you know.

07:34.546 --> 07:36.347
I'd be proud.

07:36.414 --> 07:39.149
I don't think you came down here
just to tell me that.

07:39.217 --> 07:41.452
Help me save
Mark Jackson's life.

07:43.488 --> 07:45.689
For some reason,
I have faith in you.

07:45.757 --> 07:50.928
Hey, Ilene, I've got
your tuna on wheat.

07:50.996 --> 07:52.796
Later, Kent.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.768
I've got
some restocking to do.

07:57.836 --> 07:59.536
Fresh blood
for the next one?

07:59.604 --> 08:02.406
Oh, I get it. You're a behavioral
science doctor, right?

08:02.474 --> 08:06.710
And you are
an adrenaline junkie.

08:07.979 --> 08:10.648
I just like what I do,
if that's what you mean.

08:10.715 --> 08:13.984
Yeah.
When you do it right, you know,

08:14.052 --> 08:17.254
and no one dies. No need to feel
ashamed about that, by the way.

08:17.322 --> 08:18.989
You can't save them all.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.824
I know that.

08:20.892 --> 08:23.093
Does it make
a difference to you

08:23.161 --> 08:25.045
that he's
a famous sports star?

08:25.130 --> 08:27.715
A human life is
a human life, Dr. Lightman.

08:27.799 --> 08:30.017
Right. So...

08:32.537 --> 08:34.471
How close to the brink
do they have to come

08:34.539 --> 08:35.972
to get your motor hot?

08:36.041 --> 08:38.025
That's sick.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.511
Mouth to mouth.

08:41.578 --> 08:43.447
I mean, there's nothing
more intimate than that.

08:43.515 --> 08:45.449
Right? And then there's
the chest compressions,

08:45.517 --> 08:48.452
knowing that
if you stop pumping,

08:48.520 --> 08:49.853
so does the heart.

08:49.921 --> 08:51.689
Like I said,
I do what I do.

08:51.756 --> 08:55.326
But unlike what you said,
I try not to ask questions after.

08:58.863 --> 09:02.800
So the accident is
just the foreplay.

09:02.867 --> 09:05.769
And the rescue,
that's the main event.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.705
But the save,

09:07.772 --> 09:11.775
that's where
you get to release.

09:14.446 --> 09:16.647
Everything ok,
Ilene?

09:16.714 --> 09:18.449
Yeah. I'm fine.

09:19.818 --> 09:22.820
Go home, please.

09:22.887 --> 09:24.721
Mmm.

09:30.795 --> 09:33.330
Do you always get
so close to the delivery boy?

09:33.398 --> 09:36.767
That is my brother.

09:36.835 --> 09:38.402
Look, I don't know
what you came here to do.

09:38.470 --> 09:40.537
But what you're saying
is crazy.

09:40.605 --> 09:43.674
Yeah, you're telling me,
darling.

09:43.742 --> 09:45.909
The kind of crazy
I live for.

09:48.579 --> 09:52.916
We're pretty sure your son stole
that SUV, Mrs. Jackson.

09:52.984 --> 09:55.919
Hang on.
Our neighbor was on vacation, ok?

09:55.987 --> 09:58.021
Mark and his friends
just borrowed it.

09:58.089 --> 09:59.723
Is that
what Mark told you?

09:59.791 --> 10:02.393
Or is that what his lawyer instructed you
to say Mark told you?

10:02.444 --> 10:03.927
Oh, God.

10:03.995 --> 10:06.930
It must be difficult
raising a child,

10:06.998 --> 10:10.434
and especially a son,
on your own.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.986
I do the best I can.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.973
This wasn't the first time
Mark did something like this, was it?

10:17.442 --> 10:19.343
He's been doing
so good.

10:19.411 --> 10:23.147
He even applied
to technical school.

10:26.117 --> 10:28.252
I can hear the fear
in your voice.

10:28.319 --> 10:30.421
Listen, I want you to know
that we believe

10:30.488 --> 10:34.958
the D.A. is over-reaching
with this murder two.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.527
And we want to help you,
Mrs. Jackson.

10:36.594 --> 10:39.096
You're working
for the D.A.

10:39.164 --> 10:44.034
Well, actually, we like to believe
that we work for the truth.

10:47.572 --> 10:50.007
Mmm.

10:50.074 --> 10:52.843
When it happened--
you know, I mean--

10:52.911 --> 10:55.679
and when Mark
first heard that

10:55.747 --> 10:59.183
it was Juan Salazar
who was killed,

10:59.250 --> 11:00.951
you know what
he said to me?

11:01.019 --> 11:02.786
My baby,
you know what he said?

11:02.854 --> 11:08.325
He said, mom, how come
I got to walk away, and he died?

11:08.393 --> 11:11.161
Survivor's guilt.

11:11.229 --> 11:16.099
Look... I know damn well
that he stole that truck.

11:16.167 --> 11:18.769
He's never tried to
tell me that he didn't.

11:18.837 --> 11:22.039
He did wrong,
and he knows it.

11:22.106 --> 11:26.276
But there's one thing
that he swears--

11:26.344 --> 11:29.847
that light was green.

11:31.282 --> 11:33.116
You believe that?

11:33.184 --> 11:36.186
I'm his mother.

11:36.254 --> 11:38.889
I believe him.

11:38.957 --> 11:42.793
Why didn't he tell me
the light was green?

11:42.861 --> 11:45.028
Well, you need
to ask him about that.

11:49.267 --> 11:52.035
Is it off?

11:52.103 --> 11:53.537
Well, you take it
out of the fridge.

11:53.605 --> 11:55.038
You take the cap off,
right?

11:55.106 --> 11:57.808
You stick your beak in,
and you give it a good sniff.

11:57.876 --> 11:59.943
I'll hold.

12:01.713 --> 12:03.647
I'm not smelling the milk

12:03.715 --> 12:05.983
until you give me an answer
on the Mayan ruin trip, dad.

12:06.050 --> 12:07.818
Well, if by Mayan ruins,
you mean

12:07.885 --> 12:10.387
running around Cancun
with a bunch of 17-year-old girls,

12:10.455 --> 12:12.089
good luck
with that one, Em.

12:14.826 --> 12:17.761
If you really want
Mayan ruins, I can--

12:17.829 --> 12:20.097
Dad? Dad?

12:20.164 --> 12:22.599
Dad, what happened?
Dad? Are you there?

12:24.335 --> 12:26.003
Dad?

12:31.809 --> 12:33.176
Dad! Dad!

12:33.244 --> 12:36.013
Dad, are you there?

12:52.230 --> 12:55.566
Don't worry.
You're going to be ok.

12:55.633 --> 12:57.968
I'm here.

13:07.568 --> 13:09.168
2 vehicle TC, pulses normal.

13:09.236 --> 13:10.837
Reactive pupils,
and the airway's clear.

13:10.904 --> 13:13.673
Dr. Lightman,
open your eyes.

13:13.740 --> 13:16.008
- Was he alert at the scene?
- He was confused.

13:16.076 --> 13:19.078
No.

13:24.384 --> 13:26.052
Can you hear me?

13:29.256 --> 13:31.591
You were in
an accident.

13:33.727 --> 13:35.561
Cal?

13:38.732 --> 13:41.801
Hey.
How are you feeling?

13:43.303 --> 13:45.605
Like I've been hit
by a car.

13:45.672 --> 13:48.040
How long
was I out for?

13:48.108 --> 13:50.109
Not long.
You've got a concussion,

13:50.177 --> 13:52.778
so they want to keep you
on a 24-hour hold.

13:54.448 --> 13:56.349
Welcome back,
Dr. Lightman.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.084
What's she doing here?

13:58.152 --> 14:00.052
She was the first one there
at the accident.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.989
She saved you.
Oh, yeah?

14:03.056 --> 14:04.757
I was driving home from work.
I saw the accident.

14:04.825 --> 14:06.726
That's a likely story.

14:06.793 --> 14:08.561
You ready to go
to your room?

14:08.629 --> 14:10.530
I'll go with her.

14:11.698 --> 14:13.799
Not you.

14:13.867 --> 14:17.603
You... Get lost.

14:17.671 --> 14:19.739
Dad.

14:22.643 --> 14:24.043
No, it's fine.

14:24.111 --> 14:25.761
He needs his rest.

14:30.717 --> 14:33.686
Oh. Hello.
Hang on.

14:33.753 --> 14:36.289
Oh, that was fun.
Do me a favor.

14:36.356 --> 14:39.225
Why don't you see if you can find me
a proper cup of tea?

14:39.293 --> 14:42.295
Sometime this year
would be good.

14:46.466 --> 14:48.701
You got to keep that woman away
from Emily.

14:48.769 --> 14:50.136
All right.
So you're telling me

14:50.204 --> 14:51.637
that you think Ilene
had something to do

14:51.705 --> 14:52.838
with your accident?

14:52.906 --> 14:54.240
Oh, no. It's just
a pure coincidence

14:54.308 --> 14:56.409
she shows up just at
the right moment to rescue me.

14:56.476 --> 14:57.877
It happens all the time,
Gill.

14:57.945 --> 14:59.145
So what happened
when she got there?

14:59.213 --> 15:02.782
I don't know.
I just remember her stroking my head.

15:02.849 --> 15:05.384
All right. She's the one
who called 911, Cal.

15:05.452 --> 15:07.653
She stayed with you
after you blacked out.

15:07.721 --> 15:09.789
She's the reason you got here
as quickly as you did.

15:09.856 --> 15:13.059
No, wait. No. It's all coming back
to me now. Yeah.

15:13.126 --> 15:14.360
She had a halo,
I think.

15:14.428 --> 15:16.028
What happened to
the other driver?

15:16.096 --> 15:18.864
He walked away.
Air bags, unlike your car.

15:18.932 --> 15:20.700
You know, he says
you ran a red light.

15:20.767 --> 15:22.184
Yeah, which is nonsense.
The same as happened

15:22.269 --> 15:24.136
with that kid
and the baseball player, right?

15:24.204 --> 15:26.472
Emily, you're not staying at
home alone tonight.

15:26.540 --> 15:28.190
All right, darling?
I'm not a child.

15:28.275 --> 15:30.476
You just go stay with
a friend, all right?

15:30.544 --> 15:31.744
Why?

15:31.812 --> 15:33.145
Ooh.

15:33.213 --> 15:35.114
Nice try, dad.

15:35.182 --> 15:38.117
What?

15:38.185 --> 15:40.086
I was just in
a car crash, Em.

15:40.153 --> 15:43.723
Ok. I'll give you the benefit
of the doubt this one time.

15:43.790 --> 15:45.625
Cheers.

15:48.695 --> 15:51.130
What, you two still here?

15:53.900 --> 15:55.534
You should hit
your head harder.

15:55.602 --> 15:57.370
I heard that!

16:03.610 --> 16:05.311
Excuse me. Hi.

16:05.379 --> 16:06.679
Where's Dr. Lightman?

16:06.747 --> 16:08.447
He's not here.
Can I help you?

16:08.515 --> 16:10.616
You can stop pulling favors
with the DC police.

16:10.684 --> 16:12.151
You trying
to get your hands

16:12.219 --> 16:13.919
on Mark Jackson's
confession tape?

16:13.987 --> 16:15.454
Well, if Mark didn't run
a red light,

16:15.522 --> 16:18.357
then he shouldn't have
to do hard time for an accident.

16:18.425 --> 16:20.192
He stole a car,
fled from the scene,

16:20.260 --> 16:21.577
and confessed.
Case closed.

16:21.662 --> 16:24.063
He's not in there.

16:24.131 --> 16:28.301
And why are you
so ashamed, anyway?

16:30.036 --> 16:31.570
I beg your pardon?

16:31.638 --> 16:33.372
You heard me.

16:36.877 --> 16:38.311
Try not to swallow now.

16:39.913 --> 16:41.614
Or blink.

16:41.682 --> 16:43.282
Good--

16:43.350 --> 16:46.419
so you do have a heart.

17:54.287 --> 17:57.623
Why didn't you just ask
to see my locker?

17:57.691 --> 17:59.325
Why'd you do it,
Ilene?

17:59.393 --> 18:01.327
You mean help people?

18:02.662 --> 18:05.698
You know...

18:05.766 --> 18:07.666
There's so much going on
in your face.

18:07.734 --> 18:09.835
One second,
you're scared.

18:09.903 --> 18:12.304
The next, you're angry.

18:12.372 --> 18:14.273
The next, you're proud.

18:14.341 --> 18:17.376
Dr. Lightman, you have
a nasty concussion.

18:17.444 --> 18:20.145
You shouldn't be up
and walking around.

18:20.197 --> 18:21.981
You want me to find out
about you.

18:22.048 --> 18:27.219
Don't you? I mean,
you're leading me to it.

18:28.855 --> 18:32.124
But the fear--
see, that fear there--

18:34.060 --> 18:37.229
you're terrified
I won't understand.

18:40.867 --> 18:42.468
So you save people.

18:42.536 --> 18:45.237
That's my job.

18:45.305 --> 18:47.239
You know,
this false modesty

18:47.307 --> 18:48.741
is getting
a little bit old, Ilene.

18:48.809 --> 18:51.677
Ok, so I help people.

18:51.745 --> 18:53.712
When you can.

18:55.715 --> 18:57.883
Juan Salazar is...

19:00.253 --> 19:01.821
Is what?

19:01.888 --> 19:03.823
Nothing.

19:03.890 --> 19:05.925
I saw how his death
affected you.

19:05.992 --> 19:09.395
It was like he was
the first one you'd lost.

19:13.633 --> 19:14.900
Really?

19:14.968 --> 19:16.469
He was the first?

19:16.536 --> 19:19.638
'Cause that's
interesting to me,

19:19.706 --> 19:22.808
'cause, technically speaking,
you didn't lose him.

19:22.876 --> 19:24.443
He died on impact.

19:28.415 --> 19:33.352
So there's 16 articles
in here.

19:33.420 --> 19:37.323
One every year. And every one at
the same time of year.

19:37.390 --> 19:40.426
And Salazar is the only fatality
in this little collection.

19:45.465 --> 19:47.566
Help me save
Mark Jackson.

19:47.634 --> 19:50.069
What, are you
blackmailing me now?

19:51.304 --> 19:54.240
Or let him rot.

19:54.307 --> 19:58.143
'Cause after all, he's not a famous
baseball player, right?

19:58.211 --> 20:00.880
He's just a car thief
who had it coming.

20:05.318 --> 20:06.819
I'm off.

20:06.887 --> 20:08.187
Where are you going?

20:08.255 --> 20:09.972
I'm going home,
darling.

20:10.056 --> 20:11.924
You shouldn't do that.

20:11.992 --> 20:13.859
Tell me something
I don't know.

20:13.927 --> 20:16.762
You know you want to.

20:26.982 --> 20:28.749
Dad.

20:28.816 --> 20:30.751
I thought I told you
to stay with a friend.

20:30.819 --> 20:32.336
What are you doing
out of the hospital?

20:32.420 --> 20:35.756
Well, I passed all my tests with
flying colors, didn't I?

20:35.824 --> 20:37.091
Count to 10.

20:37.158 --> 20:39.159
Recite the alphabet backwards,
you know.

20:39.227 --> 20:42.596
Reagan's the President--
liberally speaking, of course.

20:42.664 --> 20:44.665
So, what about you,
then?

20:44.733 --> 20:47.434
I was just getting
some things.

20:47.502 --> 20:48.702
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

20:48.770 --> 20:51.372
I was going to go over
to Francie's.

20:55.543 --> 20:58.045
I've got
a concussion, Em,

20:58.113 --> 20:59.913
not a brainectomy.

20:59.981 --> 21:01.582
You were going to Willy's,
weren't you?

21:01.650 --> 21:04.284
Liam's.
Aha.

21:05.887 --> 21:07.755
Shouldn't you be
lying down, resting?

21:07.822 --> 21:10.591
Oh, what, you mean,

21:10.659 --> 21:13.027
like being waited on
hand and foot?

21:13.094 --> 21:15.929
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Great minds.

21:15.997 --> 21:19.767
So, wake me up
on the hour every hour.

21:19.834 --> 21:21.385
Dad, come on.
What about...

21:21.469 --> 21:23.137
What about what?

21:24.806 --> 21:26.340
What about Liam?
What about him?

21:26.408 --> 21:28.008
You're such a pain.

21:28.076 --> 21:30.310
If you don't wake me up
once an hour,

21:30.378 --> 21:32.312
with a knock to the head
like this,

21:32.380 --> 21:34.148
that could mean...

21:34.215 --> 21:37.017
Really, I mean,
I hate to say it, Em, but...

21:37.085 --> 21:39.687
So how about
some beans on toast

21:39.754 --> 21:40.854
before I kick
the bucket, then?

21:40.922 --> 21:42.523
You got
to be kidding.

21:42.590 --> 21:44.525
When Jackie fell on her head
during cheerleading,

21:44.592 --> 21:46.527
she was on a liquid diet
for days.

21:46.594 --> 21:47.895
Oh, yeah?
Give us a beer, then.

21:47.962 --> 21:49.229
Are you trying
to be annoying,

21:49.297 --> 21:51.065
or does it just
come naturally?

21:51.132 --> 21:53.400
It comes naturally.

21:56.738 --> 21:57.938
Uh, no.

21:58.006 --> 21:59.773
No.
Hey! What?

21:59.841 --> 22:01.041
Give it.
Give it to me.

22:01.109 --> 22:02.443
I've got
to call Gillian.

22:02.510 --> 22:05.245
No, you should be resting,
or I'm going to Liam's.

22:05.313 --> 22:07.181
And good luck trying to stop me
in your condition.

22:07.248 --> 22:10.350
So just forget about work.
Work? What work?

22:10.418 --> 22:13.120
Drink your water.
All of it.

22:17.459 --> 22:19.893
Em?
What?

22:19.961 --> 22:21.395
Turn the light out?

22:21.463 --> 22:24.498
Just close your eyes.

22:26.985 --> 22:29.036
Look...

22:29.104 --> 22:32.172
I don't know.
All right?

22:32.240 --> 22:35.476
All I know is
I killed Juan Salazar.

22:35.543 --> 22:36.677
Me.

22:36.745 --> 22:38.178
You told your mother
the light was green.

22:38.246 --> 22:40.380
Is that true?

22:40.448 --> 22:42.382
Why didn't you
tell me about it?

22:43.251 --> 22:45.452
You never asked.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.621
It was green,
right?

22:47.689 --> 22:49.723
I don't know what you guys
want me to say.

22:49.791 --> 22:51.859
That's the problem, Mark.
You're worried too much

22:51.926 --> 22:53.861
about what other people
want you to say.

22:53.928 --> 22:56.163
You screwed up
stealing that car, Mark.

22:56.231 --> 22:58.999
Everything I did is
messed up.

22:59.067 --> 23:01.602
But did you run
a red light? Stop.

23:01.669 --> 23:03.871
Close your eyes.

23:06.107 --> 23:07.808
And just go
back there.

23:07.876 --> 23:09.543
Just tell me
what you remember.

23:09.611 --> 23:11.311
That's all
I want to hear.

23:17.118 --> 23:18.786
That light was green.

23:18.853 --> 23:21.989
I didn't run
no red light.

23:23.024 --> 23:25.826
Good.

23:34.569 --> 23:36.136
Nightmare.

23:36.204 --> 23:37.871
Hang on a sec.

23:40.975 --> 23:43.310
Changing channels.

23:44.512 --> 23:46.547
Nope.
Still there.

23:46.614 --> 23:48.182
My brain must be
on the blink.

23:48.249 --> 23:51.084
Again?

23:51.152 --> 23:54.221
Emily asked us over so you wouldn't
have to leave the house.

23:56.090 --> 23:58.659
Where is she?
The little brat.

23:58.726 --> 24:01.762
School.
Oh. And that makes a change.

24:01.830 --> 24:03.547
I'm going
to get her for this.

24:03.631 --> 24:05.232
You actually read
this book?

24:05.300 --> 24:08.252
No, Loker.
I just leave it laying around

24:08.336 --> 24:10.491
so bunkers like you will find it
and think I'm clever.

24:10.793 --> 24:11.993
Could be Emily's.

24:12.093 --> 24:13.489
All right, so two different people

24:13.689 --> 24:14.669
you being one of them.

24:14.758 --> 24:15.792
Go through an intersection.

24:15.858 --> 24:17.957
They both crash.
Both say they didn't tun the red light.

24:18.157 --> 24:19.392
How is that possible?

24:21.214 --> 24:22.414
Did you not rehearse this>

24:23.112 --> 24:25.324
Just to make this whole
visit thing more annoying,

24:27.028 --> 24:30.134
We came here, primarily,
to see if you were okay.

24:30.647 --> 24:32.305
Did you sleep
on that couch last night?

24:33.856 --> 24:35.056
I like the couch.

24:35.256 --> 24:37.027
What's wrong with the couch,
tell me that?

24:37.555 --> 24:39.620
Well, someone is either
messing with the lights,

24:39.720 --> 24:41.591
messing with the people, or both.

24:41.691 --> 24:42.771
You being one of those people.

24:42.971 --> 24:44.969
You know, this is doing my head
in worse that the crash.

24:45.069 --> 24:47.167
So who gets to change traffic lights?

24:47.267 --> 24:50.223
Secret Service have radio transmitters
that do that on their rearview mirrors.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.476
FBI too. It's called an Opticon.

24:52.597 --> 24:54.014
Ambulance drivers.

24:54.082 --> 24:57.184
So, Ilene Clarke has
the ability

24:57.252 --> 25:00.354
to change the lights as
part of her job, right?

25:00.421 --> 25:02.356
Ambulances change hands from
shift to shift.

25:02.423 --> 25:03.457
She'd say
that anybody

25:03.524 --> 25:04.625
could've changed
those lights.

25:04.692 --> 25:06.159
What else you got?

25:06.227 --> 25:09.062
Well, Ilene Clark lives here in D.C.
with her younger brother Kent.

25:09.130 --> 25:10.647
They've lived all over
the east coast.

25:10.732 --> 25:12.332
Nothing really
popped out at me

25:12.400 --> 25:15.969
until I tracked down
those news clippings that you found.

25:16.037 --> 25:17.704
Well, there's one
that you missed.

25:33.554 --> 25:34.821
Always in December,

25:34.889 --> 25:36.890
always around about
the anniversary of mommy's death.

25:36.941 --> 25:38.926
Ilene is always
the first on the scene.

25:38.993 --> 25:40.894
Being a hero.

25:40.962 --> 25:43.230
Look at how she's dressed.
In all of these, street clothes.

25:43.298 --> 25:45.065
Off-duty.
Every time.

25:45.133 --> 25:47.134
She knew the accidents
were going to happen ahead of time.

25:47.201 --> 25:49.870
No one died
until Juan Salazar.

25:49.938 --> 25:51.488
So she's escalating.

25:51.572 --> 25:54.841
No. Salazar was
a mistake.

25:54.909 --> 25:55.876
Her first.

25:55.944 --> 25:58.829
And the guilt's
killing her.

26:06.330 --> 26:10.400
Uh, Ilene's not home.

26:16.407 --> 26:19.643
I--she--
Ilene's not home.

26:30.627 --> 26:32.228
Did Ilene write this?

26:33.477 --> 26:37.314
Oh. Even better.
You did.

26:39.164 --> 26:41.298
What have you got
in there?

26:41.366 --> 26:42.933
You mind
if I get a drink?

26:43.001 --> 26:45.236
I've been told
I need to stay hydrated.

26:47.505 --> 26:49.940
Oh, really?

26:51.109 --> 26:55.412
Is this--what?
This is... Drain cleaner?

26:55.480 --> 26:59.817
Eh. That's juicy-ade,
tango Berry.

26:59.885 --> 27:02.052
Right.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.059
So, tell us about
the crash, then.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.895
Crash? Wh--what crash?

27:10.963 --> 27:12.697
The one
where it all started.

27:12.765 --> 27:15.700
The one that made you
and Ilene orphaned.

27:15.768 --> 27:20.004
It was, um,
an accident.

27:20.072 --> 27:21.506
An accident.

27:21.573 --> 27:22.874
As opposed to
all the others.

27:22.941 --> 27:26.511
Ilene's a good person.
A hero.

27:26.578 --> 27:28.813
Say that again,
only this time,

27:28.881 --> 27:31.683
say it without all that business
with your shoulders.

27:31.750 --> 27:34.252
Business.
What do you mean, business?

27:34.320 --> 27:36.387
Like that.

27:36.455 --> 27:39.791
It means that
you don't really,

27:39.858 --> 27:43.945
honestly, don't think
that she's a hero.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.865
Can I ask you something,
Kent?

27:47.933 --> 27:51.202
Did your sister have
something to do with the accident?

27:51.270 --> 27:54.205
Uh, Ilene was--
Ilene was playing.

27:54.273 --> 27:55.473
She was a kid.

27:55.541 --> 27:56.975
Playing how?

27:57.042 --> 27:58.676
I bet I know.

28:00.045 --> 28:03.281
With a ball,
right?

28:05.851 --> 28:08.119
With a fun ball.

28:08.187 --> 28:11.005
Bouncing it
off the Dash.

28:11.090 --> 28:15.693
Kent, did the accident
leave you with neurological damage?

28:21.233 --> 28:25.403
Mom told her to stop,
but Ilene was being a...

28:26.672 --> 28:29.907
I don't want to talk
about this anymore. No more.

28:29.975 --> 28:32.176
You're still angry
at her.

28:35.581 --> 28:40.018
Mom turned
to yell at her.

28:40.085 --> 28:42.186
And she yelled.

28:43.822 --> 28:46.457
There was a car coming
the other way.

28:46.525 --> 28:48.126
Mom was in his lane.

28:48.193 --> 28:51.796
And he...

28:51.864 --> 28:54.465
He honked his horn.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.634
Mom saw him coming,
but--

29:00.339 --> 29:02.740
Take your time, son.
Take your time.

29:04.443 --> 29:06.144
Ilene tried
to save mom.

29:06.211 --> 29:08.279
But she couldn't.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.985
That's ok.

29:14.053 --> 29:17.321
That's ok, Kent.

29:19.058 --> 29:22.093
You'll be happy to know
your light was green.

29:22.161 --> 29:23.361
Delighted.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.863
A second later...
It's red.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.532
There's only one way
that can happen.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.100
I don't see
an ambulance.

29:29.168 --> 29:31.369
And again, you know,
she was off-duty.

29:31.420 --> 29:33.771
Pursuing her hobby.

29:35.908 --> 29:39.377
You know, it looks like
she's expecting someone else.

29:40.546 --> 29:43.581
You see that there?
That's fear, that is.

29:43.649 --> 29:45.950
On a scale of one to 10,
it's about a 7.

29:46.018 --> 29:46.984
Fear of what?

29:47.052 --> 29:48.753
Whoever's got
the Opticon.

29:48.821 --> 29:51.322
Can you pull up
the Salazar stuff?

29:57.162 --> 29:59.363
There it is.
You just go back.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.199
Go. There. There.

30:01.266 --> 30:03.768
There push in.

30:06.905 --> 30:09.273
Kent.
What's he doing there?

30:09.341 --> 30:12.176
It's like he's watching a movie
or something.

30:12.244 --> 30:15.296
No, he's watching his sister.
Look at his eye line.

30:15.380 --> 30:18.082
He's the only one who looks like he's
being entertaining.

30:18.133 --> 30:20.485
Look. His eyes are widened,
his eyebrows are raised.

30:20.552 --> 30:25.289
It looks like Kent is who Ilene was
waiting for at your accident.

30:25.357 --> 30:26.891
He's watching.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.759
He's controlling her.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.562
He's rubbing her nose in
their mother's death.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.231
He makes the mess.

30:33.298 --> 30:35.800
She cleans it up.

31:58.189 --> 32:00.257
- Well, was he there?
- Yeah.

32:00.325 --> 32:02.927
He gave me this.

32:02.994 --> 32:04.795
Here you are.
Look and learn.

32:08.250 --> 32:10.434
Need I say more?

32:11.937 --> 32:14.705
He cloned the Opticon signal
from Ilene's ambulance.

32:14.773 --> 32:16.674
You broke in,
didn't you?

32:18.610 --> 32:21.145
You're going
to push him too far.

32:21.212 --> 32:22.813
A guy in some blurry
cell phone footage

32:22.881 --> 32:24.882
somehow caused
this accident?

32:24.950 --> 32:26.650
Don't waste my time.

32:26.718 --> 32:29.320
Why are you so invested
in railroading Mark Jackson?

32:29.387 --> 32:32.356
This case a big boost
for your career?

32:32.424 --> 32:34.158
Putting away the murderers
of a baseball phenom--

32:34.225 --> 32:35.759
season tickets for life.

32:37.295 --> 32:38.362
We're done here.

32:38.430 --> 32:40.931
After Dr. Lightman
questioned Ilene Clarke,

32:40.999 --> 32:43.100
he was in
a car accident himself.

32:43.168 --> 32:45.369
Ilene was
the first on the scene.

32:45.437 --> 32:48.372
Well, second,
after her brother.

32:48.440 --> 32:49.707
These weren't
the only ones.

32:49.774 --> 32:51.275
Kent's been causing
car accidents

32:51.343 --> 32:52.676
all over the east coast.

32:52.744 --> 32:55.279
You want to make your bones,
arrest Kent.

32:55.347 --> 32:59.583
Be a hero.
Save some lives.

33:05.557 --> 33:08.392
I showed myself in.
Hope you don't mind.

33:20.472 --> 33:23.340
Where's my brother?
He's out.

33:25.977 --> 33:27.878
He's making
more of these.

33:33.685 --> 33:37.721
That's windshield glass,
his diamonds.

33:37.789 --> 33:40.624
Yeah. He collects them
from the scene at every accident.

33:41.926 --> 33:45.663
Oh, no. Wait.
You collect them for him. Don't you?

33:45.730 --> 33:48.799
Or else he starts
bouncing his ball off your head again.

33:50.935 --> 33:52.603
I caused
our mother's death.

33:52.671 --> 33:54.438
So, how many people
you got to scrape up

33:54.506 --> 33:56.573
off the pavement
to make up for that, then?

33:56.641 --> 34:00.010
I save people.

34:00.078 --> 34:04.081
Kent asks me why I couldn't do
that for our mom.

34:04.149 --> 34:07.484
But you do get
something out of this, too,

34:07.552 --> 34:09.119
don't you?

34:11.188 --> 34:13.791
The Unabomber's brother
turned him in.

34:13.858 --> 34:16.193
But for some reason,
you haven't.

34:16.261 --> 34:18.529
Kent won't stop.
He can't.

34:18.596 --> 34:21.532
I have to be there
to save those people.

34:21.599 --> 34:23.701
You could've stopped him.

34:23.768 --> 34:26.770
I mean,
some hero you are, right?

34:37.882 --> 34:40.951
We both know that's not
a sandwich order.

34:46.424 --> 34:49.025
And you thought
I'd never understand.

34:51.563 --> 34:53.496
It's Lexington
and Maryland.

34:53.565 --> 34:57.468
It's right around
the corner.

35:04.175 --> 35:06.777
Everybody, get back.
Get back. Give him air.

35:13.134 --> 35:14.718
Kent.
Oh, my God.

35:14.786 --> 35:17.020
Sis. Hey, sis.

35:21.143 --> 35:22.577
It's the remote...

35:23.646 --> 35:25.413
He used
to control you.

35:25.481 --> 35:27.849
Can you tell me
where it hurts?

35:27.900 --> 35:29.184
On a scale of 1 to 10?

35:29.251 --> 35:32.721
No.
Leave me alone!

35:32.788 --> 35:35.657
- Kent, calm down. Stop it.
- No, no.

35:35.725 --> 35:39.627
He wants to die, love.

35:39.695 --> 35:41.429
He wants you
to watch him die.

35:41.497 --> 35:43.631
- That's insane.
- It's not as insane

35:43.699 --> 35:46.868
as what you two have been up to
your entire adult lives.

35:49.305 --> 35:50.538
Can't say it plainer
than that.

35:50.606 --> 35:52.707
This is
what you want?

35:52.775 --> 35:55.410
It's exactly
what he wants.

35:55.478 --> 35:58.780
Otherwise, why choose somewhere
so close to home?

35:58.848 --> 36:01.449
You've got it
all timed out,

36:01.517 --> 36:03.218
haven't you, Kent?

36:03.285 --> 36:05.220
Why would you
do this?

36:05.287 --> 36:07.722
You took my diamonds.

36:07.790 --> 36:09.691
Plus, he wants
to stick it to you.

36:09.759 --> 36:11.960
Watch you fail
all over again.

36:23.706 --> 36:26.708
Is this
what he does to you, eh?

36:30.112 --> 36:33.214
Kent, it's over.
You have to stop.

36:33.282 --> 36:35.550
Make me.

36:35.618 --> 36:38.386
Make me.

36:38.437 --> 36:39.888
Leave me here.

36:39.955 --> 36:43.158
Leave me here to die.

36:43.225 --> 36:44.826
Oh, like she left
your mum to die?

36:45.895 --> 36:49.764
How's it feel, Kent?
Look at her.

36:49.832 --> 36:52.667
You win.

36:54.270 --> 36:56.204
How does it feel?

37:01.477 --> 37:04.078
Do your job,
darling.

37:06.832 --> 37:08.750
Kent, you have
a collapsed lung.

37:10.653 --> 37:13.338
Ohh!

37:24.633 --> 37:25.967
Here.

37:36.612 --> 37:38.079
You trained her well,
mate.

37:47.656 --> 37:51.209
He's stable.
Possible broken right femur.

37:57.550 --> 38:00.501
It's going to be ok.

38:11.897 --> 38:13.848
It's like I said
when we first met,

38:13.916 --> 38:16.401
you're amazing.

38:16.485 --> 38:18.319
What you do.

38:24.326 --> 38:26.327
Here.

38:27.363 --> 38:28.863
Go for it.

38:55.724 --> 38:58.026
Well,
this much I know--

38:58.093 --> 39:01.162
you never wanted
to hurt anyone.

39:02.498 --> 39:05.600
I heard you told that
to the D.A. thanks.

39:05.668 --> 39:07.568
But no thanks.

39:11.240 --> 39:13.808
We both know I deserve
what's coming to me.

39:13.876 --> 39:16.010
But you're happy
about it.

39:17.279 --> 39:18.746
I'm free.

39:18.814 --> 39:20.748
I know it sounds strange,
but...

39:20.816 --> 39:23.351
The last few nights in here,

39:23.419 --> 39:25.586
I've finally been able
to sleep.

39:25.654 --> 39:28.957
I bet it's the food.

39:31.527 --> 39:33.461
Dr. Lightman,
when I asked you

39:33.529 --> 39:35.296
what kind of a doctor
you were, you said you--

39:35.364 --> 39:37.532
I said
I poke about a bit.

39:37.599 --> 39:39.267
Well, now that
you've done that...

39:39.335 --> 39:41.636
What have you found?

39:42.871 --> 39:45.006
A life...

39:45.074 --> 39:47.475
Worth saving?

39:57.619 --> 40:00.888
Look after yourself.

40:00.956 --> 40:02.657
All right?

40:16.505 --> 40:18.139
Mrs. Jackson, hi.
Oh, hey.

40:18.207 --> 40:19.524
How's Mark?

40:19.608 --> 40:21.776
Um, scared,

40:21.844 --> 40:24.645
but he's holding up.

40:24.713 --> 40:28.316
Prison is not exactly like
juvenile hall.

40:28.384 --> 40:31.536
Uh, the D.A. told me
that she reduced the charges.

40:31.620 --> 40:36.124
Yes, she did, and
that's why I came by.

40:36.175 --> 40:39.060
I just really wanted
to thank you

40:39.128 --> 40:41.029
for never giving up
on him.

40:41.096 --> 40:42.864
I was just doing
my job.

40:42.931 --> 40:46.134
Maybe if I'd done mine,
he wouldn't be there.

40:47.369 --> 40:50.805
You know, there are kids
with both parents,

40:50.873 --> 40:52.974
all the money and opportunities
in the world,

40:53.042 --> 40:55.209
and they still manage
to mess it all up.

40:58.113 --> 41:00.348
I love him.

41:00.416 --> 41:01.682
You know,
with good behavior,

41:01.750 --> 41:03.518
he could be out
in just a few years.

41:03.585 --> 41:05.787
I hope you're right.

41:05.854 --> 41:07.955
I want him
to a have a future.

41:08.023 --> 41:10.525
I know he will.

41:10.592 --> 41:13.428
Thank you again.

41:21.837 --> 41:24.072
That's my book.

41:25.974 --> 41:27.341
What's that, then?

41:27.409 --> 41:29.010
Oh, a memory test.

41:29.078 --> 41:32.046
Look, it was just
a knock to the head, Em.

41:32.114 --> 41:34.816
No such thing as just a knock
to the head at your age.

41:34.883 --> 41:37.351
Where'd you get
that mouth from?

41:37.419 --> 41:39.987
I forget.
You tell me.

41:40.055 --> 41:43.491
Look, that little horror show
was locked away

41:43.558 --> 41:44.892
in the attic
for a reason, now.

41:44.960 --> 41:46.494
Why didn't you
burn it, then?

41:46.562 --> 41:48.596
Can I get back
to this now?

41:48.664 --> 41:50.898
Who's this?

41:50.966 --> 41:53.701
That's... Some cousin.

41:53.769 --> 41:55.870
Kath, her name is.
Was.

41:55.938 --> 41:58.806
All that fried food.

41:58.874 --> 42:01.943
Ok.
Who's that guy?

42:02.010 --> 42:03.744
I don't know.

42:03.812 --> 42:04.745
Really?
Really.

42:04.813 --> 42:06.247
Seriously?
Seriously.

42:06.298 --> 42:07.748
He just walked
into the frame

42:07.816 --> 42:10.284
just at the moment when your mom was
taking the picture.

42:10.352 --> 42:14.422
So that's not a picture of you
wearing white jeans.

42:14.490 --> 42:17.391
What, me? Never.

42:17.459 --> 42:19.944
Oh! Hello.

42:20.028 --> 42:23.197
Oh, that's...

42:23.265 --> 42:25.099
Very clever, Em.
Sneaky.

42:25.167 --> 42:26.767
Are those
the Mayan ruins?

42:26.835 --> 42:28.970
I don't know.
I can't remember.

42:29.037 --> 42:31.806
I'm going to Cancun
with my friends next year.

42:31.874 --> 42:33.975
Can I come?

42:34.042 --> 42:36.244
So is that a yes?

42:36.311 --> 42:38.813
- What?
- Mexico.

42:38.881 --> 42:40.648
- Who?
- Dad.

42:40.716 --> 42:41.883
What were we
talking about?

42:41.950 --> 42:44.252
Don't be a plonker.

42:44.319 --> 42:46.888
You get that mouth
from me, girl.

42:46.955 --> 42:50.024
Don't you forget it.
