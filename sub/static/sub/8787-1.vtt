04:28.108 --> 04:29.507
Professor!

04:31.307 --> 04:32.707
Catherine!

04:34.306 --> 04:35.707
Professor...

04:39.106 --> 04:41.066
We found something beautiful!

04:41.107 --> 04:42.586
I don't believe it!

04:42.627 --> 04:44.827
Big, big, big surprise!

04:54.026 --> 04:55.426
Over here!

04:55.466 --> 04:56.866
Taylor!

05:02.106 --> 05:03.545
Dr Langford, hello.

05:03.586 --> 05:05.585
What have we here?

05:06.305 --> 05:07.706
Cover stones.

05:07.746 --> 05:09.625
It's fantastic.

05:18.385 --> 05:20.007
Catherine,
come!

06:01.623 --> 06:03.903
What in God's name is that?

06:03.943 --> 06:06.143
I wish I knew.

06:59.381 --> 07:02.220
There are symbols
painted everywhere.

07:02.261 --> 07:05.340
Names, titles of owners,
lists of offerings.

07:05.380 --> 07:07.341
All major structures at the time...

07:07.380 --> 07:09.740
...were covered with hieroglyphics.

07:09.780 --> 07:12.500
When will
the academic community accept...

07:12.540 --> 07:14.660
...the pharaohs of the 4th dynasty...

07:14.700 --> 07:17.860
...did not build the Great Pyramid?

07:17.900 --> 07:18.779
Look, look...

07:18.820 --> 07:22.459
Inside the most incredible
structure ever erected...

07:22.499 --> 07:25.339
...there are no writings whatsoever.

07:25.379 --> 07:26.499
Doctor Jackson!

07:26.540 --> 07:29.099
You left out the fact
that Colonel Vyse...

07:29.179 --> 07:32.259
...discovered
quarrymen's inscriptions...

07:32.299 --> 07:35.019
...of Khufu's name
within the pyramid.

07:35.059 --> 07:38.059
Uh, his discovery was a fraud.

07:38.098 --> 07:39.939
Well, I hope you can prove it.

07:39.979 --> 07:42.139
Who do you think
built the pyramids?

07:46.378 --> 07:48.578
I don't have any idea. I mean...

07:48.619 --> 07:49.818
Men from Atlantis?

07:49.859 --> 07:51.499
Or Martians, perhaps?

07:52.818 --> 07:55.618
The point is not who built them,
but when they were built.

07:55.698 --> 07:57.378
I mean, we all know...

07:57.418 --> 08:00.298
...new geological evidence
dates the Sphinx...

08:00.338 --> 08:02.418
...back to a much earlier period.

08:02.458 --> 08:05.378
I think we have
to begin to re-evaluate...

08:05.417 --> 08:08.658
...everything
we've come to accept about...

08:08.697 --> 08:11.138
I mean, I've been able to show...

08:11.177 --> 08:13.137
...a fully developed
writing system...

08:13.817 --> 08:16.497
...appeared
in the first two dynasties.

08:16.537 --> 08:18.137
You know, which...

08:18.177 --> 08:20.657
Almost as if it was based...

08:20.697 --> 08:22.737
...on an even earlier prototype.

08:23.457 --> 08:27.577
Is there a lunch or something
that everybody...

08:41.015 --> 08:43.496
- Doctor Jackson?
- What? Yes?

08:43.535 --> 08:45.656
Someone wants to speak with you.

08:46.176 --> 08:49.056
The Air Force?
What's this? What is this?

08:49.096 --> 08:51.176
Step over to the car, please.

08:53.815 --> 08:54.976
Sir?

08:58.535 --> 09:01.095
- We goin' somewhere?
- You'll be fine.

09:01.135 --> 09:03.135
We'll take care of these.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.015
Jackson...

09:09.055 --> 09:10.895
...those your parents?

09:13.615 --> 09:15.374
Foster parents.

09:17.055 --> 09:19.255
What is this all about?

09:19.295 --> 09:20.775
A job.

09:20.815 --> 09:22.855
What kind of a job?

09:22.934 --> 09:26.494
Translation.
Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.

09:30.614 --> 09:32.334
Interested?

09:33.173 --> 09:34.974
I'm gonna go now.

09:35.014 --> 09:39.373
Go where? You've just been evicted
from your apartment.

09:39.414 --> 09:41.573
Your grants have run out.

09:41.614 --> 09:45.013
Everything you own
are in those two bags.

09:46.013 --> 09:49.173
You want to prove
that your theories are right?

09:50.253 --> 09:52.213
This is your chance.

09:54.373 --> 09:55.733
What's this?

09:55.773 --> 09:57.413
Travel plans.

10:00.013 --> 10:01.012
Sir?

10:32.411 --> 10:34.371
Mrs O'Neil?

10:35.171 --> 10:36.771
Come on in.

10:42.570 --> 10:44.611
Mrs O'Neil, is your husband home?

10:45.371 --> 10:46.771
Yes.

10:47.451 --> 10:49.570
Might we be able to speak with him?

10:50.651 --> 10:52.650
You can try.

11:24.849 --> 11:29.649
Excuse me, Colonel O'Neil.
We're from General West's office.

11:32.928 --> 11:34.008
Sir?

11:36.088 --> 11:40.328
We're here to inform you
that you've been reactivated.

11:44.768 --> 11:46.768
That guy's a mess.

11:49.368 --> 11:51.488
How'd he get like that?

11:51.528 --> 11:54.968
His kid died.
Accidentally shot himself.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.408
Jesus!

12:17.886 --> 12:19.166
"Clear."

12:25.766 --> 12:26.966
Cold?

12:27.006 --> 12:28.847
Allergies.

12:30.206 --> 12:32.446
Always happens when I travel.

12:34.406 --> 12:35.966
There you go.

12:37.365 --> 12:38.366
Hi.

12:38.646 --> 12:41.886
Doctor Jackson?
Doctor Gary Meyers. How are you?

12:41.925 --> 12:43.326
What is this place?

12:43.366 --> 12:46.165
Nuclear missile silo.
But it's been converted.

12:46.205 --> 12:47.805
- Barbara Shore.
- Hello.

13:06.365 --> 13:07.765
Okay, Jackson.

13:07.805 --> 13:08.924
- Welcome.
- Hello!

13:10.245 --> 13:11.645
This...

13:11.885 --> 13:13.884
Where'd you find this?

13:13.924 --> 13:17.364
Giza Plateau, 1928.

13:17.404 --> 13:19.604
I've never seen anything like this.

13:19.644 --> 13:21.244
Of course you haven't.

13:21.284 --> 13:22.884
No-one has.

13:22.924 --> 13:24.563
There's two lines of hieroglyphs.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.643
The inner track
has the classic figures.

13:26.684 --> 13:29.844
But the outer track is like
the cartouche in the centre.

13:29.884 --> 13:32.324
It's got writing
unlike we've ever found before.

13:32.363 --> 13:33.883
Those aren't hieroglyphics.

13:33.923 --> 13:37.643
It might be some form
of hieratic or maybe cuneiform.

13:40.603 --> 13:43.363
The translation
of the inner track is wrong.

13:43.403 --> 13:46.723
Must've used Budge. I don't know
why they keep reprinting him.

13:46.762 --> 13:48.763
Excuse me?
What... what are you doing?

13:48.803 --> 13:50.882
We... we've used
every known technique.

13:50.922 --> 13:53.003
That's a curious word to use
- "Gebbeh".

13:53.043 --> 13:54.042
Yeah.

13:54.123 --> 13:55.923
Then an adverbial "sedjem-en-ef".

13:56.002 --> 13:58.003
Then "sealed"...

13:58.242 --> 13:59.482
...and "buried".

13:59.522 --> 14:02.362
Excuse me.
What are you... what are you doing?

14:02.402 --> 14:04.402
It's not "coffin".

14:05.522 --> 14:07.522
It's "for all time".

14:09.082 --> 14:11.082
Who the hell translated this?

14:12.561 --> 14:14.481
I... I did.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.602
It should read
"A million years into the sky...

14:16.642 --> 14:20.001
...is Ra, sun god,
sealed and buried for all time".

14:20.041 --> 14:21.961
It's not "door to heaven".

14:22.002 --> 14:23.441
It is...

14:29.201 --> 14:30.641
..."Stargate".

14:32.160 --> 14:34.681
So why is the military
so interested...

14:34.721 --> 14:37.041
...in 5,000-year-old
Egyptian tablets?

14:37.081 --> 14:39.121
My report says 10,000.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.880
Afternoon, Colonel.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.840
Um... do I know you?

14:48.880 --> 14:51.160
Col. Jack O'Neil
from General West's office.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.240
I'll be taking over from now on.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.160
This figure of 10,000 is ludicrous.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.239
Egyptian culture
didn't exist until...

14:58.280 --> 15:01.799
We know. But the sonic and
radiocarbon tests are conclusive.

15:01.839 --> 15:04.559
These are cover stones.
Was there a tomb underneath?

15:04.599 --> 15:08.080
No, no, no, no. But we found
something a lot more interesting.

15:08.119 --> 15:09.359
Excuse me.

15:09.399 --> 15:11.679
This information
has become classified.

15:13.199 --> 15:15.799
From now on,
no information is to be passed on...

15:15.839 --> 15:20.239
...to non-military personnel
without my express permission.

15:22.479 --> 15:24.279
Catherine, what's going on here?

15:24.359 --> 15:25.718
I'm not sure.

15:28.359 --> 15:29.998
Colonel O'Neil?

15:30.039 --> 15:33.238
I think you owe me an explanation.

15:33.278 --> 15:35.798
I was told I had complete autonomy.

15:35.838 --> 15:37.958
Plans change.

15:37.997 --> 15:42.238
Why are you here? Why did they
bring you on this project?

15:45.157 --> 15:47.197
I'm here in case you succeed.

15:53.478 --> 15:56.797
"Searched for cuneiform and
other pre-dynastic hieroglyphics."

15:56.837 --> 15:59.757
"No matches whatsoever.
I've exhausted all sources...

15:59.797 --> 16:01.557
...in comparing
the cartouche symbols...

16:01.596 --> 16:05.757
...against all writing samples
from the period, pre- and post-."

16:05.797 --> 16:07.796
"Still no similarities."

16:09.036 --> 16:11.037
"I'm never gonna get paid."

16:18.876 --> 16:19.876
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

16:44.035 --> 16:45.995
Can I borrow this?

17:07.674 --> 17:09.273
Orion.

17:43.473 --> 17:44.592
Hi.

17:44.953 --> 17:46.353
Right here.

17:46.392 --> 17:49.072
Jackson, I'd like you
to meet General West.

17:49.113 --> 17:50.112
Hello.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.072
Oh, right - General!

17:54.472 --> 17:57.712
So you think you've solved
in 14 days...

17:57.752 --> 17:59.872
...what they couldn't solve
in two years?

17:59.912 --> 18:01.112
Two years?

18:05.191 --> 18:06.672
Any time.

18:07.872 --> 18:08.951
Um...

18:09.751 --> 18:12.511
I have some stuff to look at.

18:12.552 --> 18:15.511
Uh... if you'll just pass 'em down.

18:15.551 --> 18:17.711
You'll have to share them cos I...

18:17.751 --> 18:19.671
Sorry, I don't have enough of those.

18:19.710 --> 18:22.151
But, anyway... Okay, all right.

18:22.190 --> 18:24.751
We're looking at a picture
of the cover stones.

18:24.790 --> 18:26.631
Now, on the outer track...

18:26.671 --> 18:29.190
...these figures
that you had believed...

18:29.230 --> 18:32.470
...to be words to be translated
were, in fact...

18:37.350 --> 18:39.070
Sorry about that.

18:39.110 --> 18:41.950
Were, in fact, star constellations.

18:43.510 --> 18:46.349
These constellations
were placed in a unique order...

18:46.390 --> 18:48.789
...forming a map
or an address of sorts.

18:48.829 --> 18:52.150
Seven points to outline
a course to a position.

18:52.190 --> 18:53.469
And, uh...

18:56.349 --> 19:01.069
...to find the destination within
any three-dimensional space...

19:01.149 --> 19:04.949
...we need six points...

19:05.949 --> 19:10.188
...to determine an exact location.

19:10.229 --> 19:12.589
You said you needed seven points.

19:13.149 --> 19:15.548
Well, no. Six for the destination.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.868
But to chart a course you need...

19:19.349 --> 19:21.308
...a point of origin.

19:21.348 --> 19:24.108
Except there's only six symbols
in the cartouche.

19:24.148 --> 19:27.187
The seventh actually
isn't inside the cartouche.

19:27.228 --> 19:28.707
It's below it here...

19:28.748 --> 19:32.147
...designated
by a little pyramid with...

19:33.628 --> 19:34.907
...two...

19:36.228 --> 19:37.828
...funny...

19:38.388 --> 19:40.387
...neat little guys...

19:40.627 --> 19:43.628
...and a funny little line
coming out of the top.

19:47.507 --> 19:48.907
Anyway, uh...

19:49.507 --> 19:51.227
He did it.

19:51.267 --> 19:54.267
No! That symbol
isn't anywhere on the device.

19:55.387 --> 19:57.386
What device?

20:03.667 --> 20:05.427
Show him.

20:47.145 --> 20:49.185
What is that?

20:51.385 --> 20:53.384
It's your "Stargate".

20:56.744 --> 20:58.544
Come, Jackson.

20:58.584 --> 21:02.824
"Technical personnel
report to command centre."

21:05.864 --> 21:07.304
Monitors up!

21:07.343 --> 21:08.624
Monitors are up.

21:08.664 --> 21:12.743
Mitch, bring up the details
on the centre monitor, please.

21:14.063 --> 21:15.944
I've got details... on.

21:34.822 --> 21:35.943
Hold it!

21:35.982 --> 21:37.063
Wait.

21:38.262 --> 21:40.422
Do you have a?

21:40.462 --> 21:42.462
Oh, here. Sorry.

21:42.862 --> 21:44.462
Hey, hey, hey, don't!

21:44.502 --> 21:45.861
Two figures...

21:45.902 --> 21:47.862
...on either side...

21:48.302 --> 21:51.862
...praying beside a pyramid
with the sun directly above it.

21:52.741 --> 21:54.101
He's right.

21:54.141 --> 21:56.181
It was in front of us
the whole time.

21:56.822 --> 21:58.661
General West...

21:58.701 --> 22:01.781
...Jackson has identified
the seventh symbol.

22:01.821 --> 22:02.941
Go ahead.

22:02.982 --> 22:06.021
Programming seventh symbol
into computer.

22:06.061 --> 22:07.741
Chevron one is holding.

22:08.301 --> 22:10.501
Chevron one is locked in place.

22:10.700 --> 22:13.781
Power output at 23 per cent.

22:22.100 --> 22:24.020
Chevron two is holding.

22:24.060 --> 22:25.100
"Engage."

22:25.140 --> 22:27.340
Chevron two is locked in place.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.140
We're at 35 per cent.

22:29.180 --> 22:31.740
We got a condition red in the gate.

22:31.780 --> 22:33.260
Evacuate all personnel.

22:33.300 --> 22:36.420
Area secure. Heading back.
Seal off the door.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.540
It was under the cover stones?

22:40.579 --> 22:44.019
Yes. My father found it in 1928.

22:44.059 --> 22:47.459
Made out of a mineral
unlike any found on Earth.

22:47.499 --> 22:49.939
Chevron five locked in place.

22:49.979 --> 22:51.739
79 per cent.

22:54.619 --> 22:56.619
Chevron six is holding.

22:57.858 --> 23:00.299
Chevron six is locked in place.

23:00.338 --> 23:03.378
This is as far as we have
ever been able to get.

23:14.178 --> 23:15.378
Chevron seven...

23:17.337 --> 23:18.418
"Engage."

23:18.458 --> 23:21.298
Chevron seven is locked in place.

23:42.097 --> 23:44.096
Send in the probe.

23:45.736 --> 23:47.777
Let's go! Let's go!

23:53.136 --> 23:54.217
Yes, sir.

23:54.256 --> 23:56.896
Record all information
from the Stargate.

24:03.936 --> 24:05.936
Clear inner silo for approach.

24:05.976 --> 24:07.535
"Clear inner silo."

24:07.575 --> 24:09.936
Everybody outta here!
Let's go, let's go.

24:48.854 --> 24:51.494
It's guiding itself.
Can you believe that?

25:08.853 --> 25:11.693
The beam has locked itself
onto a point somewhere...

25:12.773 --> 25:14.772
...in the Kaliam galaxy.

25:14.813 --> 25:17.893
It has mass. It could be a moon
or a large asteroid.

25:17.932 --> 25:19.692
Where are we on that map?

25:19.732 --> 25:21.332
The blue dot.

25:29.332 --> 25:30.652
That's right, Jackson.

25:31.572 --> 25:34.852
It's on the other side
of the known universe.

25:37.772 --> 25:39.291
We're losing the signal.

25:44.052 --> 25:47.251
This is the information
the probe sent back to us.

25:48.211 --> 25:49.972
Freeze and enhance.

25:50.651 --> 25:53.291
You can clearly see the gate
on the other side.

25:53.331 --> 25:57.091
Both gates must have functioned
as a doorway between our worlds.

25:57.130 --> 26:00.371
These readings tell us
it's an atmospheric match.

26:01.410 --> 26:03.491
Barometric pressure, temperature...

26:05.130 --> 26:06.930
...and, most importantly, oxygen.

26:08.331 --> 26:09.930
These markings are different.

26:09.971 --> 26:12.930
They don't match the symbols
on our gate.

26:12.970 --> 26:15.090
That's why we may have to abort.

26:16.490 --> 26:20.410
This project is for naught
without a reconnaissance mission.

26:20.449 --> 26:21.890
Once on the other side...

26:21.930 --> 26:24.449
...we'd have to decipher
the markings on their gate...

26:24.490 --> 26:26.050
...and, in essence, dial home...

26:26.089 --> 26:28.210
...in order to bring the team back.

26:28.250 --> 26:30.889
Based on this new information,
I don't see how we can do that.

26:30.929 --> 26:33.089
Well, I could do that.

26:39.009 --> 26:40.609
Are you sure?

26:47.089 --> 26:48.568
Positive.

26:54.849 --> 26:56.609
Your call.

26:58.808 --> 27:00.328
You're on the team.

27:42.926 --> 27:46.847
You're understand, this complicated thinks.

27:49.486 --> 27:51.806
That's why I want you, Jack.

27:52.686 --> 27:57.005
We've open the doorway to world, we've know nothing about.

28:06.645 --> 28:08.045
Jackson...

28:09.326 --> 28:10.765
Hello. Hi.

28:11.965 --> 28:13.685
I have something for you.

28:13.725 --> 28:15.405
No, I...

28:15.445 --> 28:16.445
Yes.

28:18.485 --> 28:21.405
I found it with Stargate
when I was a child.

28:21.444 --> 28:23.604
It has brought me luck.

28:27.644 --> 28:29.924
You can bring it back to me.

28:44.684 --> 28:45.924
Back-up storage.

28:47.083 --> 28:48.684
Reserve power on.

28:48.723 --> 28:51.243
All right, we're secure.
Let's clear this area.

28:51.284 --> 28:55.763
Surveillance and monitoring
equipment, reserve power...

28:55.803 --> 28:56.803
...and on.

29:02.442 --> 29:06.323
If anybody has anything to say,
now's the time to say it.

29:12.922 --> 29:14.922
"Vector tracking set."

30:47.118 --> 30:49.798
Molecular deconstruction
in progress.

32:02.595 --> 32:06.074
Jackson, it's all right.
It's over. Stay with him.

32:06.115 --> 32:08.154
Jackson, listen to me. Keep moving.

32:08.195 --> 32:10.115
It wears off in a minute.

32:10.155 --> 32:12.235
What a rush!

32:15.075 --> 32:17.155
Prepare to move out.

32:34.874 --> 32:36.874
Three teams. Let's go.

32:36.914 --> 32:38.913
"White team, go."

32:53.753 --> 32:55.673
Brown, Freeman, bring up the rear!

33:07.472 --> 33:09.472
"Team two, move up."

33:20.392 --> 33:21.872
Clear. No contact.

33:24.112 --> 33:25.991
Freeze. Hold for sounds.

33:34.431 --> 33:36.431
"One-two ratio stable."

33:36.551 --> 33:38.231
Conditions are similar to inside.

33:38.270 --> 33:40.271
I wanna take a look around.

33:40.551 --> 33:41.950
Kawalsky. Feretti.

34:21.588 --> 34:23.589
"Move up there."

34:53.348 --> 34:54.748
I knew it.

34:59.148 --> 35:01.227
"Point three, three, two."

35:02.187 --> 35:03.187
Report.

35:03.227 --> 35:06.707
Our quarter-mile perimeter survey
is just about complete, sir.

35:11.827 --> 35:14.426
Wrap this up and
get everybody back inside.

35:14.467 --> 35:17.787
I want you all back through
the Stargate within the hour.

35:17.986 --> 35:20.986
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Colonel?

35:21.026 --> 35:22.867
- Sir?
- Jackson!

35:22.906 --> 35:24.866
Start working on the Stargate.

35:24.906 --> 35:28.226
- What's that all about?
- I don't know, Feretti.

35:28.266 --> 35:30.305
I'm gonna need more time.

35:30.346 --> 35:32.466
There's bound to be
more structures here.

35:32.505 --> 35:34.946
Or some other traces
of civilisation.

35:34.985 --> 35:38.786
Not this trip. Just get back
in there and re-establish contact.

35:38.825 --> 35:41.865
It's not so easy. This is a replica
of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

35:41.905 --> 35:45.305
We won't find any hieroglyphic
inscriptions or carved relief.

35:45.345 --> 35:47.945
I mean,
we really need to look around more.

35:47.986 --> 35:52.225
Your job is to realign the Stargate.
Can you do that or not?

35:53.985 --> 35:55.585
I can't.

35:58.704 --> 36:00.664
You can't or you won't?

36:00.705 --> 36:02.704
I can decipher the symbols
on the Stargate...

36:02.745 --> 36:04.744
...but I need an order of alignment.

36:04.784 --> 36:07.344
Those co-ordinates were
on tablets back on Earth.

36:07.384 --> 36:10.024
There must be something
like that here and I just...

36:10.065 --> 36:11.864
I just need to find it.

36:14.024 --> 36:16.544
Find it?
What do you mean, find it?

36:16.584 --> 36:18.863
You didn't say anything
about finding anything.

36:18.904 --> 36:21.144
Well, I assumed the tablets
would be here.

36:21.183 --> 36:22.183
You assumed?

36:22.224 --> 36:24.184
You're a lyin' son of a bitch!

36:24.223 --> 36:27.263
You didn't say a word
about finding anything!

36:27.304 --> 36:29.343
Kawalsky.

36:29.384 --> 36:33.104
Set up a camp down here.
Organise our supplies.

36:33.183 --> 36:34.543
Sir...

36:34.583 --> 36:36.863
You've got your orders.

36:46.342 --> 36:47.903
This is hot.

36:47.942 --> 36:50.103
You know, I can't believe
we're stuck here.

36:50.142 --> 36:52.303
Don't be such a doomsayer, Feretti.

36:52.342 --> 36:54.582
- Yeah, give it a rest.
- Yes, please.

36:54.622 --> 36:56.222
If we're not back soon...

36:56.262 --> 36:58.622
...they'll turn on the gate
from the other side.

36:58.662 --> 37:00.422
Oh, no. It doesn't work that way.

37:00.462 --> 37:04.742
If you don't turn it on from here,
we're screwed. Okay?

37:04.782 --> 37:08.022
So I'm tellin' you guys,
we're not goin' anywhere.

37:08.062 --> 37:09.422
Shut up.

37:09.862 --> 37:11.861
This is a nice tent.

37:12.742 --> 37:15.501
Oh, we each get a tent.
That's nice.

37:39.820 --> 37:41.340
What the hell is that?

37:48.500 --> 37:50.499
I got everything here but sun block.

37:50.540 --> 37:51.540
Hey!

37:52.340 --> 37:53.939
- Hi.
- Hey.

37:54.739 --> 37:56.819
Isn't there something
you should be doing?

37:56.860 --> 37:58.660
Like gettin' us outta here?!

38:06.619 --> 38:08.619
Foot powder. Great (!)

38:39.778 --> 38:41.777
Base camp is up, sir.

39:39.095 --> 39:40.415
Where's Jackson?

39:54.015 --> 39:56.215
It's okay. It's okay.

39:56.655 --> 39:58.374
Shh, shh, shh...

39:58.454 --> 39:59.854
That's a good boy.

39:59.894 --> 40:01.494
Good boy.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.214
It's okay.

40:05.254 --> 40:06.734
Good boy.

40:07.373 --> 40:08.333
What?

40:08.374 --> 40:10.413
What do you want?

40:10.454 --> 40:11.734
You want some of this?

40:12.934 --> 40:14.933
Here you go. You like that?

40:17.774 --> 40:19.773
I wouldn't feed that thing!

40:20.213 --> 40:22.093
It's got a harness!

40:22.854 --> 40:24.733
It's domesticated!

40:29.133 --> 40:31.333
- Damn it!
- Let go of it!

40:41.893 --> 40:43.492
Do something!

40:50.932 --> 40:53.092
Help me!

41:30.930 --> 41:32.810
You okay, Jackson?

41:38.090 --> 41:38.730
Kawalsky.

41:38.770 --> 41:40.290
You dropped these.

41:40.330 --> 41:41.329
Brown.

41:44.730 --> 41:46.409
Get away from me.

42:55.926 --> 42:57.086
Easy...

43:20.326 --> 43:22.405
All right, Jackson.

43:23.125 --> 43:24.525
You're on.

43:25.365 --> 43:26.765
Me?

43:27.925 --> 43:30.645
You're the linguist.
Try to talk to 'em.

43:38.724 --> 43:40.045
Hi.

44:08.884 --> 44:10.883
What the hell did you say to him?

44:10.923 --> 44:12.323
Nothing.

44:27.562 --> 44:28.962
Hey...

44:29.723 --> 44:31.083
Hm?

44:31.122 --> 44:33.122
It's okay.

44:33.922 --> 44:35.482
It's okay. See?

44:56.361 --> 44:58.281
"Quartz primary element."

45:52.919 --> 45:57.079
I can't make it out. It sounds
familiar. A bit like Berber.

45:57.118 --> 45:58.678
Or maybe it's Chadic or Omotic.

46:25.317 --> 46:26.797
Thank you.

46:42.796 --> 46:43.837
Mmmm!

47:02.796 --> 47:03.795
Bonni...

47:04.755 --> 47:05.756
Bonniwae!

47:05.796 --> 47:07.195
Bonniwae?

47:07.235 --> 47:08.635
Bonniwae!

47:08.715 --> 47:10.235
Bonniwae. Bonniwae.

47:10.275 --> 47:11.635
What's that mean?

47:11.675 --> 47:13.675
I have no idea.

47:15.515 --> 47:17.715
He's inviting us to go with him.

47:17.755 --> 47:19.755
How can you be so sure?

47:21.194 --> 47:23.954
Because he's inviting us
to go with him.

47:26.595 --> 47:28.675
We were looking
for signs of civilisation.

47:28.715 --> 47:30.195
Obviously, we've found it.

47:30.234 --> 47:32.754
You want me to get us back home,
this is our best shot.

47:32.795 --> 47:33.915
Colonel, he's right.

47:33.954 --> 47:37.034
I took some readings
on what they're mining.

47:37.874 --> 47:40.874
This is the same material
as the Stargate.

47:44.354 --> 47:46.354
Radio base camp.

47:47.074 --> 47:50.553
Tell them to keep that area secured
until we get back.

47:50.594 --> 47:51.594
Yes, sir.

50:30.626 --> 50:32.627
The eye of Ra.

50:35.586 --> 50:37.427
It's the Egyptian sun god.

50:39.026 --> 50:40.867
They think he sent us here.

50:41.147 --> 50:44.546
Yeah. Wonder what could've
given 'em that idea.

50:46.626 --> 50:47.626
Ra.

50:50.146 --> 50:51.266
Ra?

50:57.825 --> 50:59.825
Where are they all going?

51:02.266 --> 51:03.665
Come in. Come in.

51:03.705 --> 51:05.425
Feretti, I can't hear you.

51:05.465 --> 51:07.465
Sir, I can't make this out.

51:08.185 --> 51:09.824
Feretti, say again.

51:11.225 --> 51:13.264
We have to abandon base camp!

51:13.705 --> 51:16.665
Repeat,
we have to abandon base camp!

51:16.704 --> 51:19.184
It's useless!
It won't work in this!

51:19.225 --> 51:20.745
Freeman, let's go! Let's go!

51:20.785 --> 51:22.224
Everybody back inside!

51:22.624 --> 51:26.624
Come on!
Take batteries!

51:36.944 --> 51:38.943
We're gonna back, right now.

51:40.863 --> 51:41.783
Wait!

52:31.021 --> 52:32.901
Stay here!

52:49.260 --> 52:52.661
What is it colonel?
Sand storm, coming this way!

52:55.180 --> 52:57.901
And what about,
excellent reason to shoot everyone.

52:57.980 --> 52:59.980
We'll stay it's over.

53:10.380 --> 53:12.380
Sorry.

53:24.139 --> 53:26.499
The pyramid! Back to the pyramid!

53:29.579 --> 53:31.938
Where the hell did that come from?

53:36.858 --> 53:38.978
Kawalsky, Brown, do you read?

53:56.858 --> 54:00.217
Hey, Jackson. I don't think
we should eat any food here.

54:00.258 --> 54:03.257
I don't know.
They might consider that an insult.

54:13.377 --> 54:17.097
Well, we don't want to offend them
now, do we, Daniel?

54:30.776 --> 54:32.416
Tastes like chicken.

54:32.456 --> 54:33.896
Tastes like chicken.

54:33.936 --> 54:35.616
It's good.

54:36.816 --> 54:38.216
It tastes...

54:43.176 --> 54:44.736
Tastes like chicken.

54:44.775 --> 54:46.855
Tastes like chicken. Good!

54:50.255 --> 54:51.615
Jackson.

54:51.655 --> 54:54.015
You said
that was an Egyptian symbol.

54:54.055 --> 54:56.135
Yeah. The eye of Ra.

54:56.175 --> 55:01.094
Would you say, then, that if they
know one Egyptian symbol?

55:01.655 --> 55:03.134
Yes.

55:03.854 --> 55:04.855
Yes.

55:09.774 --> 55:11.175
No, no.

55:27.934 --> 55:29.174
What's going on?

55:32.693 --> 55:36.213
It seems like writing
is forbidden to them.

55:42.333 --> 55:43.973
What? What?

55:49.333 --> 55:51.493
They want me to go with them!

55:51.533 --> 55:52.932
Should I stay?

55:52.972 --> 55:54.332
I'll go with them.

55:55.093 --> 55:57.092
I'll go. I'll be fine.

56:03.372 --> 56:05.531
Okay, that's good. All right.

56:07.132 --> 56:09.132
What is that smell?

56:09.172 --> 56:10.172
Oh, it's...

56:10.732 --> 56:12.212
Okay, that's good.

56:12.251 --> 56:14.572
That's good.
My hands are pretty clean.

56:14.611 --> 56:16.251
Thank you very, very much.

56:16.291 --> 56:17.732
Thank you very...

56:18.891 --> 56:20.691
Thank you. That was great.

56:21.412 --> 56:23.212
I smell much better now...

56:24.371 --> 56:25.412
Yes...

56:27.411 --> 56:29.251
Oh, Christ.

56:29.291 --> 56:31.131
I smell like a yak.

56:33.451 --> 56:35.411
No, no, please. No more.

56:35.450 --> 56:36.651
Please.

56:36.690 --> 56:38.131
Please, no more.

56:38.171 --> 56:40.170
I'm fine. I'm clean, I'm...

56:40.731 --> 56:41.930
I'm...

56:43.330 --> 56:47.410
I thought... you were
one of the other... cleaning...

57:00.409 --> 57:03.009
No. No, no, no, no. You don't...

57:03.090 --> 57:04.849
You don't have to do that. Please.

57:04.890 --> 57:06.410
Maybe you should go.

57:06.449 --> 57:08.449
Okay? It's okay.

57:08.769 --> 57:10.769
Maybe you should go.

57:10.810 --> 57:12.809
No, it's okay. It's all right.

57:12.849 --> 57:14.849
Here, let me take care of it.

57:26.328 --> 57:27.488
No, no, no.

57:27.529 --> 57:29.169
It's me.

57:29.208 --> 57:31.208
I wanted to thank you. I wanted...

57:31.249 --> 57:33.008
I'm very... I'm very happy.

57:35.128 --> 57:36.328
Thank you.

57:43.288 --> 57:44.688
Um...

57:45.567 --> 57:46.728
Daniel.

57:47.727 --> 57:48.847
Daniel.

57:48.888 --> 57:51.808
No. Uh... I'm, uh...

57:54.207 --> 57:55.447
Daniel.

57:55.487 --> 57:57.247
I'm Daniel.

57:59.007 --> 58:00.487
Sha'uri.

58:01.407 --> 58:02.847
Sha'uri.

58:05.447 --> 58:08.446
Uh... you, uh...

58:08.846 --> 58:10.447
We came...

58:11.726 --> 58:13.327
This...

58:13.686 --> 58:15.166
...pyramid.

58:15.206 --> 58:16.206
See, we...

58:16.246 --> 58:20.446
...we came from the pyramid.

58:21.166 --> 58:22.926
It's... it's okay.

58:22.966 --> 58:24.566
Never mind.

58:27.166 --> 58:28.605
It's okay.

58:57.284 --> 58:58.644
Earth.

59:01.044 --> 59:03.364
You... you know the symbol?

59:03.405 --> 59:05.404
You know the symbol?

59:05.444 --> 59:07.684
You've seen... the symbol?

59:11.404 --> 59:13.364
Show me.

59:13.404 --> 59:15.404
You show me.

59:18.484 --> 59:20.964
Kawalsky, this is base.
Do you copy?

59:21.843 --> 59:23.883
You're wasting the battery.

59:24.524 --> 59:27.803
You won't get anything in this
storm. Wait till it passes.

59:27.843 --> 59:28.923
Yeah, right.

59:29.563 --> 59:31.363
If it passes.

01:00:59.799 --> 01:01:01.799
What the hell is goin' on?

01:02:01.476 --> 01:02:03.477
All right, spread out.

01:02:04.356 --> 01:02:06.356
Behind the columns - move!

01:03:47.152 --> 01:03:49.312
It's okay. It's just a lighter.

01:03:54.071 --> 01:03:55.631
See?

01:03:59.311 --> 01:04:00.871
Here.

01:04:11.831 --> 01:04:13.791
Yeah, it's pretty fabulous.

01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:06.508
Yeah, you're right.

01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:08.548
It's pretty stupid.

01:05:13.948 --> 01:05:16.188
No, you... keep it.

01:05:19.068 --> 01:05:20.548
It's yours.

01:05:31.747 --> 01:05:32.668
No!

01:05:35.747 --> 01:05:37.787
It's dangerous!

01:06:00.666 --> 01:06:02.626
What is this place?

01:06:19.665 --> 01:06:21.305
Cypian.

01:06:21.385 --> 01:06:22.945
Rem-e-n-jef.

01:06:22.985 --> 01:06:25.025
Bah-ka-naf Sema.

01:06:25.105 --> 01:06:27.144
Tah-pah-rief.

01:06:27.785 --> 01:06:29.744
I'll be damned!

01:06:30.465 --> 01:06:31.865
Tah-pah-rief?

01:06:31.944 --> 01:06:33.425
What?

01:06:34.465 --> 01:06:35.865
Tah-pah-rief?

01:06:36.464 --> 01:06:37.864
Tah-pah-rief?

01:06:37.904 --> 01:06:39.465
Tah-pah-rief.

01:06:40.504 --> 01:06:42.065
Tah-pah-rief.

01:06:42.144 --> 01:06:43.704
Tah-pah...

01:06:44.824 --> 01:06:45.784
Neh-jed?

01:06:45.864 --> 01:06:46.784
Neh-jed?

01:06:46.864 --> 01:06:47.784
Neh-dah.

01:06:47.864 --> 01:06:49.903
Neh-dah. Neh-dah.

01:06:50.544 --> 01:06:51.504
Tiu.

01:06:51.584 --> 01:06:53.944
Tiu. Tiu.

01:06:54.104 --> 01:06:55.423
Ah...

01:06:55.464 --> 01:06:56.783
Netjer?

01:06:56.824 --> 01:06:58.143
Netjer-u?

01:06:58.224 --> 01:06:59.423
Bah? Netjer-u?

01:06:59.503 --> 01:07:00.463
Natay.

01:07:00.544 --> 01:07:02.103
Naturu.

01:07:02.183 --> 01:07:04.144
Natay. Naturu.

01:07:04.223 --> 01:07:06.023
Nafi.

01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:03.180
No signal at all?

01:08:03.221 --> 01:08:04.700
Nothing.

01:08:07.381 --> 01:08:09.340
More interference?

01:08:09.821 --> 01:08:11.300
No.

01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:13.500
They're simply not there.

01:08:37.339 --> 01:08:39.499
I haven't been able
to locate Jackson, sir.

01:08:57.859 --> 01:08:59.818
I'm looking for Jackson.

01:08:59.899 --> 01:09:02.377
Jackson.
The guy who wears this jacket.

01:09:02.457 --> 01:09:06.658
He's, uh, he's got, like,
long hair that comes down...

01:09:06.777 --> 01:09:07.978
No...

01:09:08.058 --> 01:09:10.018
No, no, no. It...

01:09:10.258 --> 01:09:11.658
He wears glasses...

01:09:11.698 --> 01:09:13.497
...so he can see.

01:09:18.937 --> 01:09:22.818
I guess the word "dweeb"
doesn't mean anything to you guys.

01:09:22.857 --> 01:09:26.737
I'm on planet X looking for a dweeb
who wears green fatigues.

01:09:26.817 --> 01:09:29.176
He wears this jacket.
He's got long hair.

01:09:29.296 --> 01:09:31.937
It comes over his eyes,
he wears glasses, and...

01:09:32.015 --> 01:09:33.577
...sneezes.

01:09:40.296 --> 01:09:41.416
Chicken.

01:09:41.737 --> 01:09:42.895
Chicken.

01:09:43.657 --> 01:09:46.015
Chicken. Chicken man. You got it.

01:09:54.216 --> 01:09:56.256
You want this?

01:10:27.734 --> 01:10:30.295
I thought
you couldn't speak their language.

01:10:30.374 --> 01:10:32.334
Hi... Scared me.

01:10:33.174 --> 01:10:35.414
It's an ancient Egyptian dialect.

01:10:35.494 --> 01:10:38.934
Unlike the rest of their culture,
it's evolved independently.

01:10:38.974 --> 01:10:40.774
But once you know the vowels...

01:10:40.814 --> 01:10:42.854
Just answer the question.

01:10:42.933 --> 01:10:46.133
Well, I mean, I just
had to learn how to pronounce it.

01:10:46.214 --> 01:10:48.573
It hasn't been a living,
spoken language...

01:10:48.654 --> 01:10:50.613
...in more than 1,000 years.

01:10:51.213 --> 01:10:55.254
Look at this. It says
a traveller from distant stars...

01:10:55.333 --> 01:10:57.053
...escaped from a dying world...

01:10:57.093 --> 01:11:00.212
...looking for a way
to extend his own life.

01:11:00.293 --> 01:11:03.413
His body decaying and weak,
he couldn't prevent his own demise.

01:11:03.493 --> 01:11:06.932
Apparently, his whole species
was becoming extinct.

01:11:06.972 --> 01:11:09.213
So he travelled...

01:11:09.292 --> 01:11:11.013
...or searched the galaxies...

01:11:11.092 --> 01:11:13.812
...looking for a way to cheat death.

01:11:13.852 --> 01:11:14.892
And, uh...

01:11:14.972 --> 01:11:18.412
...look here.
He came to a world rich with life...

01:11:18.492 --> 01:11:21.372
...where he encountered
a primitive race.

01:11:21.412 --> 01:11:23.212
Humans.

01:11:23.251 --> 01:11:26.732
A species which, with all
his powers and knowledge...

01:11:26.812 --> 01:11:28.452
...he could maintain indefinitely.

01:11:28.491 --> 01:11:32.611
He realised within a human body
he had a chance for a new life.

01:11:32.692 --> 01:11:36.291
Now, he apparently found
a young boy.

01:11:36.372 --> 01:11:40.491
It says as the frightened villagers
ran, night became day.

01:11:41.171 --> 01:11:44.451
Curious and without fear,
he walked towards the light.

01:11:48.011 --> 01:11:51.370
Ra took him
and possessed his body...

01:11:51.411 --> 01:11:55.530
...like some kind of a parasite
looking for a host.

01:11:55.571 --> 01:12:00.010
And, inhabiting this human form,
he appointed himself ruler.

01:12:01.730 --> 01:12:04.850
He used the Stargate to bring
people to this planet...

01:12:04.930 --> 01:12:07.050
...as workers for the mines.

01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:08.970
Just like the one we saw.

01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:13.170
This mineral is the building
block of all his technology.

01:12:13.210 --> 01:12:15.409
With this
he can sustain eternal life.

01:12:15.490 --> 01:12:16.450
Now...

01:12:16.570 --> 01:12:18.529
...something happened on Earth.

01:12:18.569 --> 01:12:23.010
A rebellion or uprising,
and the Stargate was buried there.

01:12:23.049 --> 01:12:27.009
Fearful of a rebellion here,
Ra outlawed reading and writing.

01:12:27.049 --> 01:12:29.409
He didn't want people
to remember the truth.

01:12:29.889 --> 01:12:32.529
Jackson, I think
you'd better look at this.

01:12:40.569 --> 01:12:43.528
That's it.
That's what we're looking for.

01:12:43.648 --> 01:12:45.288
They must've hidden it here...

01:12:45.328 --> 01:12:48.288
...in hopes that one day
the gate on Earth could be reopened.

01:12:48.409 --> 01:12:51.048
I knew they'd have it
written down someplace.

01:12:51.528 --> 01:12:53.088
Wait a minute.

01:12:53.128 --> 01:12:55.287
Where's the seventh symbol?

01:12:55.368 --> 01:12:56.848
It must have broken.

01:12:56.927 --> 01:12:58.888
It's got to be here somewhere.

01:13:01.008 --> 01:13:03.208
I got it here.

01:13:06.607 --> 01:13:08.327
It's worn off.

01:13:10.127 --> 01:13:13.487
I can't make it work
without the seventh symbol.

01:13:14.527 --> 01:13:16.007
All right, that's it.

01:13:16.087 --> 01:13:17.567
Kawalsky. Brown.

01:13:30.207 --> 01:13:31.766
Come on, Jackson!

01:14:15.524 --> 01:14:17.484
What the hell is that?

01:14:24.164 --> 01:14:25.404
Here.

01:14:25.484 --> 01:14:27.284
You might need this.

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.320
Look out!

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:49.120
Where are we going?

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:54.000
Why are we going to the Stargate?
I can't make it work.

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:57.120
Stay here and shoot anything
that comes down that ramp.

01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:58.480
What are you doing?

01:15:58.519 --> 01:15:59.520
Just cover me.

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:07.840
What is that?

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.920
- What are you looking for?
- It's gone.

01:16:45.358 --> 01:16:46.918
Put it down, Jackson.

01:18:47.033 --> 01:18:49.832
You have come here to destroy me.

01:18:52.592 --> 01:18:54.073
What is that?

01:18:59.552 --> 01:19:03.072
It's a bomb, isn't it?
That's what you were looking for.

01:19:03.151 --> 01:19:04.952
What the hell were you thinking?

01:19:04.992 --> 01:19:07.032
What did you come here for?

01:19:55.269 --> 01:19:56.430
Wait! Don't!

01:19:58.469 --> 01:19:59.429
Wait!

01:19:59.549 --> 01:20:00.349
No! No!

01:20:57.067 --> 01:20:58.787
Colonel! It's me!

01:20:59.787 --> 01:21:01.506
You all right?

01:21:11.946 --> 01:21:13.147
Where's Jackson?

01:23:09.901 --> 01:23:12.781
Sha'uri, what happened here?

01:23:12.861 --> 01:23:15.181
Ra punished us.

01:23:15.261 --> 01:23:16.661
Why?

01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:20.021
What happened to Daniel?

01:23:21.221 --> 01:23:24.020
What happened to Daniel?

01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:49.459
Son, we should not have helped
the strangers.

01:26:29.372 --> 01:26:31.092
I was dead?

01:26:37.972 --> 01:26:41.531
Your bodies, so easy to repair.

01:26:46.211 --> 01:26:48.452
You have advanced much...

01:26:48.531 --> 01:26:52.332
...harnessed the power of the atom.

01:26:52.411 --> 01:26:54.372
What are you going to do?

01:26:57.331 --> 01:27:01.691
You should not
have reopened the gate.

01:27:07.211 --> 01:27:11.091
Soon, I will send your weapon
back to your world...

01:27:11.131 --> 01:27:14.570
...with a shipment of our mineral...

01:27:16.210 --> 01:27:19.850
...which will increase
your weapon's destructive power...

01:27:19.930 --> 01:27:22.050
...a hundredfold!

01:27:22.130 --> 01:27:24.370
Why would you do that?

01:27:24.450 --> 01:27:27.170
I created your civilisation.

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:31.049
Now I will destroy it!

01:27:48.649 --> 01:27:52.529
But before my workers
question my authority...

01:27:52.568 --> 01:27:55.529
...you will prove
that I am their one god...

01:27:56.489 --> 01:27:59.048
...by killing your companions.

01:28:01.248 --> 01:28:02.648
If I refuse?

01:28:03.369 --> 01:28:06.648
Then I will destroy you...

01:28:06.688 --> 01:28:09.728
...and all who have seen you.

01:28:09.808 --> 01:28:15.168
There can only be one Ra!

01:28:32.447 --> 01:28:33.407
Sha'uri...

01:28:33.487 --> 01:28:36.446
...Ra has called an assembly...

01:28:36.927 --> 01:28:39.567
...an execution.

01:28:39.646 --> 01:28:42.926
Skaara, Nabeh,
I want you all to listen.

01:28:48.886 --> 01:28:51.606
We can't let this happen.

01:28:51.646 --> 01:28:54.206
I want you to know
what Daniel told me...

01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:57.526
...about where our people
came from...

01:28:58.966 --> 01:29:02.245
...and why we can no longer
live as slaves.

01:30:41.362 --> 01:30:42.322
Come on!

01:30:57.081 --> 01:30:58.040
Freeman!

01:31:00.281 --> 01:31:01.600
Freeman!

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:08.440
Over there! Come on!

01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:09.480
Kawalsky!

01:32:00.638 --> 01:32:01.758
Jacson!

01:32:55.076 --> 01:32:57.036
To our victory!

01:33:01.276 --> 01:33:04.235
We recovered your weapons.

01:33:06.435 --> 01:33:07.835
Here, Colonel.

01:33:11.994 --> 01:33:13.794
So what do you think?

01:33:14.275 --> 01:33:16.315
They're not exactly
Special Forces...

01:33:16.394 --> 01:33:19.115
...but they sure were
eager to join up!

01:33:19.194 --> 01:33:22.474
Take these guns away
before they hurt themselves.

01:33:23.834 --> 01:33:24.794
Sir?

01:33:24.875 --> 01:33:26.594
You heard me. Send 'em all home.

01:33:26.634 --> 01:33:29.194
There's no place
for these kids to go.

01:33:29.274 --> 01:33:31.714
Anyway, we could sure
use their help.

01:33:31.794 --> 01:33:33.514
For what?!

01:33:33.554 --> 01:33:34.874
Huh?

01:33:34.913 --> 01:33:36.713
To do what?!

01:33:46.513 --> 01:33:48.553
Why don't you
just tell 'em everything?

01:33:50.273 --> 01:33:53.753
Why don't you tell 'em
about the bomb?

01:33:53.833 --> 01:33:55.713
What's he talkin' about?

01:34:01.033 --> 01:34:02.993
My orders were simple.

01:34:05.153 --> 01:34:08.272
Track down signs
of any possible danger.

01:34:08.353 --> 01:34:10.392
If I found any,
blow up the Stargate.

01:34:12.193 --> 01:34:13.832
Well, I found some.

01:34:13.872 --> 01:34:15.512
Well, your bomb is his now.

01:34:15.552 --> 01:34:18.192
And tomorrow
he's gonna send it back to Earth.

01:34:18.272 --> 01:34:20.752
With a shipment of that mineral
they mine here.

01:34:20.832 --> 01:34:22.391
And when it goes off...

01:34:22.432 --> 01:34:25.072
...it'll be 100 times
more destructive...

01:34:25.151 --> 01:34:28.632
...than that bomb alone
is capable of.

01:34:28.711 --> 01:34:31.591
I'll intercept that bomb
before he can send it through.

01:34:31.631 --> 01:34:33.191
Why wasn't I told of this?

01:34:33.312 --> 01:34:36.752
There was no reason to tell you.
You weren't supposed to be here.

01:34:36.791 --> 01:34:38.831
You were all gonna
go back with Daniel.

01:34:38.911 --> 01:34:42.031
I was gonna stay behind
and blow up the Stargate...

01:34:42.071 --> 01:34:43.791
...and that's what I'm gonna do.

01:34:43.831 --> 01:34:46.071
It's the gate on Earth
that poses the threat.

01:34:46.151 --> 01:34:47.951
That's the one
we have to shut down.

01:34:48.030 --> 01:34:49.830
You're absolutely right.

01:34:49.911 --> 01:34:53.351
But since you don't know
how to get us back...

01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:55.951
...we don't have that option, do we?

01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:16.149
Where are they?

01:35:19.229 --> 01:35:21.029
Answer!

01:35:21.069 --> 01:35:23.869
We looked everywhere.

01:35:25.549 --> 01:35:27.508
Some kids are helping them.

01:35:53.748 --> 01:35:56.948
You would have accepted that
no matter what happened...

01:35:56.988 --> 01:35:59.188
...you would not be going home?

01:36:00.867 --> 01:36:02.987
Don't you have people
who care about you?

01:36:03.067 --> 01:36:04.867
Do you have a family?

01:36:06.547 --> 01:36:07.947
I had a family.

01:36:11.227 --> 01:36:14.267
No-one should have to outlive
their own child.

01:36:15.067 --> 01:36:16.626
I don't wanna die.

01:36:17.827 --> 01:36:19.547
Your men don't wanna die.

01:36:19.707 --> 01:36:22.347
And these people here
don't wanna die.

01:36:23.307 --> 01:36:25.706
It's a shame
you're in such a hurry to.

01:37:10.144 --> 01:37:12.265
How could you let them escape?

01:37:23.384 --> 01:37:26.583
I will not accept failure!

01:38:03.662 --> 01:38:05.222
Why are you laughing?

01:38:05.302 --> 01:38:07.422
Husbands don't do this work.

01:38:10.022 --> 01:38:11.421
Husband?

01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:39.980
Married?

01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:43.300
Don't be angry.

01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:46.300
I didn't tell them.

01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:48.980
Tell them what?

01:38:54.980 --> 01:38:57.939
That you did not want me.

01:39:37.618 --> 01:39:39.658
What are you drawing?

01:39:42.497 --> 01:39:44.458
The day of our victory.

01:40:04.097 --> 01:40:05.897
Connect the moons.

01:40:11.296 --> 01:40:13.017
That's it.

01:40:15.257 --> 01:40:17.056
The point of origin.

01:40:20.176 --> 01:40:21.896
What're you doing?

01:40:21.936 --> 01:40:23.256
I've found it!

01:40:23.296 --> 01:40:24.936
What're you talkin' about?

01:40:24.976 --> 01:40:27.296
The seventh symbol.

01:40:29.176 --> 01:40:31.136
We're goin' home.

01:40:54.975 --> 01:40:56.375
Let's go.

01:40:59.574 --> 01:41:01.894
You'll bring disaster
on all of us, son.

01:41:01.974 --> 01:41:05.254
Father, we will not live as slaves.

01:41:10.574 --> 01:41:11.654
Kasuf!

01:41:14.774 --> 01:41:16.893
Take a look at your gods.

01:41:23.814 --> 01:41:25.533
Take a good look.

01:41:48.532 --> 01:41:50.573
The caravan is approaching.

01:41:53.332 --> 01:41:55.692
Send the bomb down to the Stargate.

01:42:55.450 --> 01:42:57.370
What's happening up there?

01:43:21.089 --> 01:43:22.248
How you doin'?

01:43:35.687 --> 01:43:36.767
Damn!

01:43:36.848 --> 01:43:38.967
Come on, Feretti!

01:43:48.687 --> 01:43:49.727
Come on!

01:43:51.007 --> 01:43:53.127
Get that door!

01:44:17.286 --> 01:44:19.246
Hey, you okay? You all right?

01:44:27.125 --> 01:44:27.845
Spread out!

01:44:35.765 --> 01:44:37.805
Let's go!

01:44:41.764 --> 01:44:42.724
We're dead!

01:44:42.805 --> 01:44:45.604
- Quit talkin' like that!
- Well, what are we gonna do!

01:44:45.644 --> 01:44:46.604
Cover me.

01:44:46.685 --> 01:44:48.165
Cover you?!

01:44:48.605 --> 01:44:49.685
Kawalsky!

01:44:59.804 --> 01:45:02.244
Feretti,
help me push this thing over!

01:45:13.684 --> 01:45:15.484
Send the bomb to Earth now!

01:45:15.563 --> 01:45:17.964
I will send it myself!

01:45:35.763 --> 01:45:38.722
- What are you doing?
- Completing this mission.

01:45:38.803 --> 01:45:41.762
We agreed to dismantle
the gate on the other side.

01:45:41.802 --> 01:45:43.762
And you will.

01:45:43.882 --> 01:45:45.842
That's your job now.

01:45:45.922 --> 01:45:48.802
I'm gonna stay here,
make sure this goes off.

01:45:57.081 --> 01:45:59.041
You've got seven minutes.

01:46:48.839 --> 01:46:49.799
What are you doing?

01:46:52.719 --> 01:46:54.199
Jackson!

01:46:54.279 --> 01:46:55.679
Wait for me.

01:48:57.354 --> 01:49:00.633
- You got any rounds, Feretti?
- We're all out of ammo!

01:49:00.713 --> 01:49:02.033
Incoming!

01:49:29.832 --> 01:49:33.032
Kawalsky, we gotta do something.

01:49:34.232 --> 01:49:35.192
Damn!

01:49:37.471 --> 01:49:38.472
Hey!

01:49:38.552 --> 01:49:40.192
Stop!

01:49:40.272 --> 01:49:41.152
Hey!

01:50:32.069 --> 01:50:33.869
I am no longer amused.

01:50:52.668 --> 01:50:55.069
You will die together.

01:51:09.268 --> 01:51:12.308
Give my regards to King Tut,
asshole.

01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:26.339
- How much time do we have left?
- 45 seconds.

01:54:26.379 --> 01:54:28.100
He's leaving. Turn it off.

01:54:28.139 --> 01:54:30.179
I'm trying to. I can't disarm it.

01:54:30.219 --> 01:54:31.019
What?

01:54:31.059 --> 01:54:33.259
I can't stop it.
They've got it rigged.

01:54:47.898 --> 01:54:50.018
I've got an idea.

01:57:07.932 --> 01:57:09.612
- I always knew you'd get us back.
- Yeah, right.

01:57:09.732 --> 01:57:11.092
Later.

01:57:13.812 --> 01:57:15.372
Thanks, Daniel.

01:57:23.612 --> 01:57:25.572
You sure you wanna do this?

01:57:25.651 --> 01:57:27.171
Yes. I'm sure.

01:57:28.211 --> 01:57:29.971
You gonna be all right?

01:57:32.971 --> 01:57:34.971
I'm gonna be all right.

01:57:35.291 --> 01:57:37.171
How about you?

01:57:40.611 --> 01:57:42.171
Yeah.

01:57:44.410 --> 01:57:46.330
Yeah, I think so.

01:57:53.450 --> 01:57:56.290
Tell Catherine this brought me luck.

01:58:00.210 --> 01:58:01.970
I will.

01:58:06.530 --> 01:58:08.529
I'll be seein' you around.

01:58:10.369 --> 01:58:12.369
Doctor Jackson.

02:00:12.370 --> 02:00:13.370
