Beast Boy!

00:24.758 --> 00:27.195
- Oh, Beast Boy, you have returned.
- I really, really missed you.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.197
So, I take it
you found yourself?

00:29.230 --> 00:30.431
That's right, I did.

00:30.464 --> 00:33.401
I found myself at
Tri-State Auto Repair.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.069
That's cool, I guess.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.670
I found lots of things actually.

00:36.704 --> 00:37.805
Like Billy.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.110
Hi, Billy.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.044
Come on, fools. It's Billy.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.115
Ain't you listening?

00:47.148 --> 00:49.583
This is Billy!

00:49.617 --> 00:51.519
Uh, this isn't gonna be
like that time

00:51.552 --> 00:53.787
you brought a drifter
named Brian home, is it?

00:56.390 --> 00:57.191
Sup?

00:57.225 --> 00:59.227
Guys, this is Billy!

00:59.260 --> 01:01.495
AKA William J. Regan.
Check it.

01:04.198 --> 01:05.466
Incredible.

01:05.499 --> 01:08.136
That hair... Magnificent.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.703
No way.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.139
It is you.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.640
William J. Regan.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.508
The "R" in B.E.R.

01:14.542 --> 01:17.178
That's right.
I was a sweet, sweet 20%

01:17.211 --> 01:18.412
of something special.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.448
So, why did you give it all up?

01:20.481 --> 01:22.350
It wasn't an easy choice.

01:22.383 --> 01:25.119
But we realized, if the song was
powerful enough to create worlds,

01:25.153 --> 01:26.720
it could also destroy them.

01:26.754 --> 01:29.123
So, we swore an oath
to seal it away, hide it,

01:29.157 --> 01:31.259
and never speak of it again.

01:31.292 --> 01:34.195
Well, you can't keep
greatness hidden forever.

01:34.228 --> 01:35.463
I understand that now.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.131
Billy, will you help us
save our friend?

01:37.165 --> 01:40.368
Yes, but we're going to have
to get the band back together.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.439
I'm 20% of B.E.R.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.375
So, there's still 80% out there.

01:47.408 --> 01:50.244
Until you find Carl Burnett
and Franklin Enea,

01:50.278 --> 01:50.978
there's no band.

01:51.011 --> 01:52.580
So, where do you think they are?

01:52.613 --> 01:55.749
No idea, these guys
are ghosts, man. Phantoms.

01:55.783 --> 01:58.219
If they don't want
to be found, they won't be.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.887
After all the things we saw,

01:59.920 --> 02:02.223
I wouldn't be surprised
if they disappeared for good.

02:02.256 --> 02:03.824
- Found them.
- You did?

02:03.857 --> 02:06.360
Yeah, the Internet makes it
really easy to find people.

02:06.394 --> 02:07.928
Well, you may have found them,

02:07.961 --> 02:10.198
but I'm not sure they want
anything to do with B.E....

02:10.231 --> 02:12.166
I just texted them.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.335
- They're coming over now.
- Oh.

02:20.408 --> 02:22.343
- Billy.
- Carl.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.312
- Frank.
- Billy.

02:24.345 --> 02:25.546
Raven, Starfire...

02:25.579 --> 02:27.615
- Ow!
- You are not part of this reunion.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.518
Oh, I thought we was just playing
the "say two names" game.

02:30.551 --> 02:33.287
Oh, I adore the two name game.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.256
Jasper, Cornelia,

02:35.289 --> 02:37.191
Dagmar, Donald.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.263
I can't believe B.E.R.
is back together.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.931
After all the things we saw.

02:43.964 --> 02:46.300
Frank, Carl, so many years
have gone by.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.768
Tell me about
all the things you saw.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.238
Uh, nothing special.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.739
I saw some things.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.375
They weren't that interesting.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.477
All right, yo.
Let's get to business.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.246
Sing The Night Begins to Shine,

02:58.279 --> 02:59.647
so we can save my dude.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.416
You really expect us
to sing this song after all...

03:02.450 --> 03:04.785
Yeah, yeah. After all you saw.
We know.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.355
What Billy's trying
to tell you is, we can't.

03:07.388 --> 03:10.391
We swore a galactic oath
to never sing it again

03:10.424 --> 03:12.226
until the prophecy is fulfilled.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.261
Prophecy?

03:13.294 --> 03:15.296
When the night shines no more,

03:15.329 --> 03:17.398
and the glory
of the land has fallen,

03:17.431 --> 03:21.369
only then will the song
be heard again.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.404
So, you can't help us get
into that other dimension

03:23.437 --> 03:24.905
where Cyborg is trapped?

03:24.938 --> 03:26.407
- Afraid not.
- Well...

03:26.440 --> 03:28.276
Unless we can come up
with a new song.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.443
That's great, then do it.

03:29.477 --> 03:30.778
Easier said than done.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.380
It's hard recreating
that kind of magic.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.382
Not to mention dangerous.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.250
But we must rescue our friend.

03:36.284 --> 03:39.287
He's gonna be trapped in that
dimension with that dragon forever.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.388
Forever!

03:40.421 --> 03:41.422

It's no dream, Billy.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.402
I never thought we'd come back.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.871
And you'll wish you never had.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.078
It's an ambush.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.048
You were fools to return.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.418
And now, with your help,

05:17.451 --> 05:20.053
I will take over this land
once again.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.388
Cyborg!

05:54.422 --> 05:57.024
Beast Boy!
How'd you guys get here?

05:57.057 --> 05:58.559
We had a little help.

05:58.592 --> 05:59.593
Who are you?

05:59.627 --> 06:01.862
- Burnett.
- Enea.

06:01.895 --> 06:02.896
Regan.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.500
B.E.R.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.969
You're real.
I can't believe it.

06:09.002 --> 06:12.172
If you're here,
we still have a chance.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.175
You made a big mistake
bringing them to me.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.879
Ah. I'm afraid, they're
the ones who made the mistake.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.949
With their help,
I will get that song.

06:21.982 --> 06:25.118
When will you realize?
I'll never give it up.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.489
Don't you remember what I said?

06:28.522 --> 06:31.425
That I would pull the music
from your metal bones.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.943
The essence of the song
still resides in B.E.R.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.880
It's power will forever
be a part of them.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.882
So, by tapping
into their harmonic aura,

06:54.915 --> 06:57.918
it would allow me
to pull the music out of you.

08:21.969 --> 08:22.770
Yes.
