00:00.001 --> 00:03.535
Latin lover narrator: <i>All right,</i>
<i>we're back. As you know, jane</i>

00:03.537 --> 00:05.504
<i>Was accidentally inseminated</i>
<i>with rafael's sperm,</i>

00:05.506 --> 00:07.439
<i>And, man, things have been</i>
<i>a little crazy since then.</i>

00:07.441 --> 00:09.641
<i>For one, her father,</i>
<i>international star</i>

00:09.643 --> 00:11.410
<i>Rogelio de la vega,</i>
<i>was back in her life,</i>

00:11.412 --> 00:13.345
<i>And back in</i>
<i>her mother's life as well.</i>

00:13.347 --> 00:16.715
<i>Unfortunately, he was fired</i>
<i>from his telenovela.</i>

00:16.717 --> 00:18.350
<i>And speaking of telenovelas,</i>

00:18.352 --> 00:20.219
<i>Remember rafael's ex-wife</i>
<i>petra?</i>

00:20.221 --> 00:21.754
<i>Well, milos,</i>
<i>her acid-throwing ex-boyfriend,</i>

00:21.756 --> 00:23.355
<i>Came back in her life.</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:25.324
I feel crazy, cooped
up in my room, scared,

00:25.326 --> 00:27.393
Just waiting for yellow
tulips to arrive.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.194
Tulips?
It was kind of
his calling card.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.397
<i>But milos had other plans.</i>
<i>He proved to petra</i>

00:31.399 --> 00:32.564
<i>That her mother could walk...</i>

00:32.566 --> 00:35.100
No! Monster!

00:35.102 --> 00:37.436
You've been lying to me?
All these years? Why?

00:37.438 --> 00:39.104
<i>...Leaving petra reeling,</i>

00:39.106 --> 00:41.040
<i>So she took comfort</i>
<i>in lachlan's arms.</i>

00:41.042 --> 00:42.241
<i>Little did she know,</i>
<i>lachlan was</i>

00:42.243 --> 00:43.675
<i>Working against her as well.</i>

00:43.677 --> 00:45.310
<i>Oh, and there was a murder</i>
<i>at the marbella.</i>

00:45.312 --> 00:46.545
<i>Roman zazo was impaled.</i>

00:46.547 --> 00:48.380
<i>See, he was working</i>
<i>for sin rostro,</i>

00:48.382 --> 00:50.215
<i>The bad guy who built</i>
<i>secret tunnels</i>

00:50.217 --> 00:52.718
<i>Underneath the marbella</i>
<i>leading to a surgery suite.</i>

00:52.720 --> 00:54.453
They were performing
plastic surgery on criminals

00:54.455 --> 00:56.388
In this room,
changing their faces.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.290
<i>Jane's ex-fiancÃ© michael found</i>

00:58.292 --> 00:59.758
<i>Evidence linking</i>
<i>rafael's father, emilio,</i>

00:59.760 --> 01:02.528
<i>To the plastic surgeon</i>
<i>working out of the hotel.</i>

01:02.530 --> 01:04.630
<i>And it certainly seemed like</i>
<i>emilio was sin rostro;</i>

01:04.632 --> 01:06.498
<i>That is, until this happened.</i>

01:06.500 --> 01:08.200
Rose: <i>Rafael, I was supposed</i>
<i>to meet your father,</i>

01:08.202 --> 01:09.468
<i>But he didn't show.</i>

01:09.470 --> 01:11.503
I think he's already left
the country.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.472
Latin lover narrator: <i>But the</i>
<i>police didn't know any of that.</i>

01:13.474 --> 01:16.308
<i>So let's see</i>
<i>how this played out, shall we?</i>

01:16.310 --> 01:19.378
Okay, let's just go through
the procedure step by step.

01:19.380 --> 01:20.846
<i>Like most children of ten,</i>

01:20.848 --> 01:23.682
<i>Jane gloriana villanueva</i>
<i>was not a fan of shots.</i>

01:23.684 --> 01:26.351
Number one: Will it hurt?

01:26.353 --> 01:27.386
A little, probably.

01:27.388 --> 01:28.654
For how long?

01:28.656 --> 01:31.390
A second. Maybe two.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.425
Hon, come on.
It would've been over by now.

01:35.328 --> 01:37.663
Can you count down from three?

01:37.665 --> 01:39.865
I want to be prepared
for the stinging.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.266
Absolutely.

01:42.235 --> 01:44.536
But you do have to let go.

01:44.538 --> 01:45.737
Oh.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.673
<i>Ah, yes, letting go.</i>

01:47.675 --> 01:49.842
<i>Something jane was</i>
<i>never very good at.</i>

01:49.844 --> 01:52.177
Okay. And three,

01:52.179 --> 01:54.580
Two, one.

01:55.748 --> 01:57.516
Jane:
<i>Mom, seriously.</i>

01:57.518 --> 02:01.153
Let go. Come on,
you're crushing the baby.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.555
Xiomara:
I can't help it.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.457
She's hemming
your graduation dress.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.626
I mean, all your hard work.
I know, mom.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.295
And you are allowed to be
as emotional as you want.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.497
In two days.
You're too early.

02:11.499 --> 02:13.432
Okay, come on, abuela,
can we finish later?

02:13.434 --> 02:14.867
I'm gonna be late to my
doctor's appointment.

02:20.173 --> 02:22.574
This one's cool though.
We get to see the baby in 3-d.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.643
And we officially
find out the sex.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.351
I have to go.
I can't be late.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.920
I need to go deal with
the catastrophe that is

02:34.922 --> 02:37.189
The marbella finances,

02:37.191 --> 02:41.493
So then we can go to Spain
at the end of the week.

02:41.495 --> 02:44.563
Lachlan, thank you.

02:44.565 --> 02:45.664
After what I did,

02:45.666 --> 02:47.799
Leaving you for rafael,

02:47.801 --> 02:50.636
It's not lost on me, the irony.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.671
That you're the only person
I can trust.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.508
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted</i>

02:56.510 --> 02:58.644
<i>That petra should</i>
<i>absolutely not trust lachlan.</i>

02:58.646 --> 03:00.612
Go. Go. (laughs)
okay.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.414
I'm going to relax,

03:02.416 --> 03:05.384
Order some room service,

03:05.386 --> 03:08.687
Maybe watch some almodÃ³var,
practice my spanish.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.688
(phone chimes)

03:09.690 --> 03:11.323
It's milos.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.959
God, he's such a pest.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.562
(sighs) and he wants to talk.

03:16.564 --> 03:18.597
Again.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.532
We're talking with you here
again because it looks like

03:20.534 --> 03:22.634
Your dad is sin rostro

03:22.636 --> 03:25.671
And has been running a plastic
surgery ring for criminals

03:25.673 --> 03:26.805
Inside your hotel.

03:26.807 --> 03:29.308
And it's really hard
for me to believe

03:29.310 --> 03:31.310
That you knew nothing about it.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.712
You know, I liked it better
when you were suspended.

03:34.781 --> 03:37.649
Look, if your father needs money

03:37.651 --> 03:39.618
Or a place to hide,
he might contact you.

03:39.620 --> 03:42.788
And if that happens,
we need to know.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.423
And you will.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.625
Because I was the one
who contacted you

03:46.627 --> 03:48.794
When he met with
the shady subcontractor.

03:48.796 --> 03:51.597
I've given you everything that
you've asked for: Access to

03:51.599 --> 03:54.366
His accounts, his e-mails, and
even my crazy sister's letter

03:54.368 --> 03:55.801
About a missing corkscrew.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.370
Rafael, calm down.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.638
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, yes.</i>

03:59.640 --> 04:01.773
<i>You remember rose, right?</i>

04:06.813 --> 04:08.814
Detective cordero,
you need to understand

04:08.816 --> 04:10.882
That rafael and I are in shock.

04:13.586 --> 04:16.555
We agree that it looks like
my husband did this,

04:16.557 --> 04:19.558
That he's a criminal, that he's
run off, gone underground.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.993
<i>Ha! Classic sin rostro.</i>

04:20.995 --> 04:23.662
<i>She did always love</i>
<i>a good play on words.</i>

04:25.732 --> 04:29.835
But truly, we had no idea
any of this was happening.

04:29.837 --> 04:32.671
Mr. Solano, you told me
to come get you at 3:00.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.039
Yeah, thank you, scott.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.374
I have an appointment.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.409
I really do need to go.

04:37.411 --> 04:38.677
Excuse me.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.545
Stay close by.

04:40.547 --> 04:41.947
In case we want to talk again.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.283
We will.

04:44.285 --> 04:45.617
Don't worry.

04:48.054 --> 04:49.855
<i>Spit it out, scott.</i>

04:53.593 --> 04:55.761
Xiomara:
<i>So what are you doing today?</i>

04:55.763 --> 04:57.763
Mmm.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.564
Look, not that I don't love
having you around more,

04:59.566 --> 05:01.633
But it's been two weeks
since you got...

05:02.635 --> 05:03.802
Since...

05:03.804 --> 05:06.538
You stopped playing santos.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.674
Don't you think maybe
it's time to move on?

05:08.676 --> 05:11.843
What do you think I'm doing?

05:11.845 --> 05:13.612
Eating a sandwich
and shopping online?

05:13.614 --> 05:16.548
I happen to be in the middle
of a heated bidding war on ebay

05:16.550 --> 05:18.550
To take my mind
off the heated bidding war

05:18.552 --> 05:20.952
Currently raging
over my acting services.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.954
Oh. Good.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.790
I didn't know you had offers.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.992
Of course I have offers.
What are they?

05:26.994 --> 05:29.394
My agent and I
are trading calls.

05:31.564 --> 05:33.332
What's going on?
I didn't realize

05:33.334 --> 05:35.600
You were so excited
to go to physical therapy.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.074
Okay, you've been through
the ultrasound drill.

05:42.076 --> 05:44.009
This is the same thing.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.445
We'll take measurements,
take a closer look at the heart,

05:46.447 --> 05:47.512
All the chambers.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.513
Ooh! (laughs)

05:48.515 --> 05:49.748
It's a little cold.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.817
Can I request
lots of pictures in advance?

05:51.819 --> 05:53.719
You got it, lots of pictures.

05:54.987 --> 05:57.556
(heart beat pulsing)

05:57.558 --> 05:59.858
So are you two gonna
find out the sex today?
Yes.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.127
You know, I was thinking
that maybe we should wait.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.496
What?
You know, it'll be
a fun surprise.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.765
Well, there's no surprise.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.767
It's definitely a girl.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.536
Then why should we find out?
(chuckles) because...

06:11.538 --> 06:13.138
I need confirmation.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.507
You know, I am a little obsessed
with planning.

06:15.509 --> 06:16.808
I like to think ahead.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.010
Bedding, paint colors, layette.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.146
Now you're just
making up words.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.849
I really want to know. Please?

06:23.851 --> 06:25.450
Fine.

06:25.452 --> 06:26.451
Thanks.

06:26.453 --> 06:27.919
The answer's yes.

06:31.624 --> 06:33.725
Everything okay?

06:33.727 --> 06:36.795
The doctor will go over
all the results.

06:36.797 --> 06:39.097
So is that not a yes?

06:39.099 --> 06:40.866
Do you see
something wrong?

06:40.868 --> 06:42.534
I'm just taking pictures.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.503
I'm not qualified
to read the results.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.037
Yeah, but, I mean,
you've read a lot of these,

06:46.039 --> 06:47.672
So does everything look normal?

06:47.674 --> 06:49.708
I'm really not able to say.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.043
Well, if everything was fine,
you'd say everything is fine.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.012
So everything's
obviously not fine.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.882
I'm sorry. Only dr. Hillcroft
can actually read the results.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.183
How about you go get
dr. Hillcroft.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.585
Okay?

07:08.127 --> 07:10.128
This bright spot
on the baby's heart

07:10.130 --> 07:11.730
Is called
an echogenic focus.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.565
And there's another one
on the bowel.

07:13.567 --> 07:16.034
Now, I know
that probably sounds scary.

07:16.036 --> 07:19.137
But let me be clear,
by itself, this has no effect

07:19.139 --> 07:21.072
On the baby's health
or the heart.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.908
So what's the
problem with it?

07:22.910 --> 07:24.976
Well, at the moment,
there is no problem.

07:24.978 --> 07:27.779
But an echogenic focus
can be a marker

07:27.781 --> 07:30.515
For possible chromosomal
abnormalities in the fetus.

07:30.517 --> 07:34.786
But like I said, it could also
be nothing, a normal variant.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.855
And you can't tell
which it is,

07:36.857 --> 07:37.823
Whether it's nothing
or something?

07:37.825 --> 07:40.225
Uh, not from
an ultrasound, no.

07:42.228 --> 07:44.463
Jane?

07:44.465 --> 07:45.931
Sorry.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.799
How do we find out then?

07:47.801 --> 07:49.901
We can do an amniocentesis.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.703
It's a relatively
common procedure

07:51.705 --> 07:54.105
Where we remove
and test fetal cells.

07:54.107 --> 07:58.076
After the procedure, we'll put
you on bed rest for 48 hours.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.846
And after the risk has passed,
you're back to your life.

08:00.848 --> 08:01.880
What's the risk?

08:01.882 --> 08:02.981
Miscarriage.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.917
Statistically,
it occurs in about

08:05.919 --> 08:08.253
One in 300 of these procedures.

08:13.259 --> 08:16.695
Sorry. I think I'm just
a little bit in shock.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.697
I know it's a lot
of information.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.233
You guys should
take some time, discuss it,

08:21.235 --> 08:23.802
And let me know
what you want to do, okay?

08:23.804 --> 08:25.637
(quietly): Mm-hmm.
Okay.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.038
Uh, thank you, doctor.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.039
Of course.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.875
Now, I do get booked though,

08:29.877 --> 08:32.110
So if you're leaning toward
having the procedure,

08:32.112 --> 08:33.645
Call right away.

08:37.550 --> 08:39.584
Latin lover narrator: <i>Jane kept</i>
<i>waiting for the doctor to</i>

08:39.586 --> 08:41.920
<i>Turn around and say everything</i>
<i>was going to be all right.</i>

08:41.922 --> 08:45.123
I'll talk to you soon.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.926
(door closes)

08:47.928 --> 08:49.995
(whispers):
It's okay.

08:56.302 --> 08:58.103
Do you think that we
should do the test?
I don't know.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.938
How did this even happen?

08:59.940 --> 09:02.173
I mean, we came
to find out it was a girl

09:02.175 --> 09:03.975
And get some cute pictures.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.210
We don't have to
decide right away.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.711
Okay, we can
think about it.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.947
Mm-hmm.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.749
Look, it's
gonna be okay.

09:18.925 --> 09:20.992
Woman:
<i>And exhale.</i>

09:20.994 --> 09:22.861
I'll see you
next time, okay?
Okay.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.563
(clears throat)

09:24.565 --> 09:25.964
Good afternoon.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.668
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah. Now we know</i>

09:29.670 --> 09:31.970
<i>Why alba was excited</i>
<i>for her physical therapy.</i>

09:31.972 --> 09:34.973
Uh, if you want to use this,
I'm almost done.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.615
(chuckles)

09:46.052 --> 09:48.153
Well, a long time ago.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.155
I need to practice.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.157
(chuckles)

09:52.159 --> 09:53.725
Xiomara:
Ma?
(clears throat)

09:53.727 --> 09:55.694
You ready?

10:03.803 --> 10:06.338
Scott, you did originally
confirm emilio's statement

10:06.340 --> 10:07.906
That he was in his office

10:07.908 --> 10:09.874
The night of
the bellboy's murder, correct?

10:14.947 --> 10:16.247
But now you're saying
that he wasn't there,

10:16.249 --> 10:18.350
But he was out on his boat?

10:18.352 --> 10:20.085
We're just
a little bit confused.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.220
Mr. Solano asked me
to back up his story,

10:22.222 --> 10:24.823
Because he didn't want anyone
to know where he really was.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.725
Why not?
(sighs)

10:26.727 --> 10:28.293
Because he was with
his girlfriend.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.762
And obviously he didn't want
his wife to find out.

10:30.764 --> 10:33.932
And you're just
telling us this now, why?

10:33.934 --> 10:36.001
I mean, you don't go around
telling people

10:36.003 --> 10:37.135
Your boss is having an affair.

10:37.970 --> 10:38.970
There's a guy code.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.305
Shh! Stop talking.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.073
But now there's rumors
going all over this hotel,

10:42.075 --> 10:44.142
People saying you think
he killed the bellboy.

10:44.944 --> 10:46.077
<i>He's a lot of things,</i>

10:46.079 --> 10:47.312
But he's not a murderer.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.680
He was with his girlfriend.

10:48.682 --> 10:49.848
And you can prove this?

10:49.850 --> 10:52.050
Yeah. Here.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.321
Her name, number, private
e-mail account he used.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.056
Contact her.
It's all right there.

10:59.392 --> 11:02.827
All right. You can go.
But not too far.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.396
We'll have more questions
later-- thank you.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.801
Can I just arrest him
'cause of the guy code comment?

11:11.370 --> 11:12.837
So, if this checks out,

11:12.839 --> 11:14.673
Emilio didn't kill the bellboy.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.174
Yeah, but according
to rose and rafael,

11:16.176 --> 11:18.343
The bellboy named
sin rostro as his killer.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.178
(whispering):
Sin...

11:20.180 --> 11:23.314
Rostro.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.783
Could be someone
working for him.

11:24.785 --> 11:25.884
Not him, necessarily.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.085
Mm.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.420
Let's talk to this girlfriend,

11:28.422 --> 11:29.721
See if she can
corroborate his story.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.056
And then we have
to talk to rose,

11:31.058 --> 11:32.090
See if she knew
about the affair.
I doubt it.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.425
She thought emilio was working

11:33.427 --> 11:34.926
The night the bellboy
got killed.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.864
I will, after you tell me
the silver fox on the bike

11:39.866 --> 11:42.067
Had nothing to do with your
running out of physical therapy.

11:45.805 --> 11:47.138
Then why are you blushing?

11:48.908 --> 11:50.341
I personally think

11:50.343 --> 11:53.478
That any man would be blessed
to have alba as a lover.

11:58.284 --> 11:59.951
What's going on here?

11:59.953 --> 12:02.020
Are you becoming
a traveling salesman?

12:02.022 --> 12:04.189
Telenovelas are
a young man's game

12:04.191 --> 12:07.092
And this... This is what
the kids are wearing.

12:07.094 --> 12:09.027
I need to stay relevant,
xiomara.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.029
(phone ringing)

12:11.031 --> 12:13.198
Oh, good, your agent.
Here.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.834
Let it go to voice mail.
Why? What if she has
a job for you?

12:15.836 --> 12:17.902
There is no job.
How do you know
if you won't answer?

12:17.904 --> 12:19.738
Because I just
hung up on her a minute ago.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.172
She only got me an audition.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.441
They want to hear if
I can do an american accent.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.443
And...?
Do you think
tom cruise auditioned

12:25.445 --> 12:27.112
For    <i>mission: Impossible</i>
<i>and its sequels?</i>

12:27.114 --> 12:29.514
I'm not sure that's
quite the same thing.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.149
That's right.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.051
I have 1.4 million more
followers than he does.

12:33.053 --> 12:35.253
Okay, so think about
your followers, then.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.156
I mean, how long
will they last,

12:38.158 --> 12:40.358
Without the joy
that you bring them.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.061
That is a fair point.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.230
And a sad one.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.832
I've been getting tweets
filled with sad-faced emojis.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.200
Exactly.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.302
You're causing them real pain.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.539
So go to that audition,
nail that american accent,

12:54.541 --> 12:56.007
And then, boom!

12:56.009 --> 12:57.475
End of story.
You're back on tv.

12:59.011 --> 13:00.145
I will think about it.

13:05.084 --> 13:06.451
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Meanwhile, it should be noted</i>

13:06.453 --> 13:08.153
<i>That after that</i>
<i>crappy doctor's appointment,</i>

13:08.155 --> 13:10.421
All rafael wanted was some time
<i>to think, as well.</i>

13:10.423 --> 13:12.190
The prodigal
son returns.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.458
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Yup. Not happening.</i>

13:13.460 --> 13:15.093
You've been pretty hard
to pin down.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.094
Yeah, well...

13:16.096 --> 13:17.428
There's a lot going on.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.830
You know, this really
isn't a good time,

13:18.832 --> 13:20.131
So, excuse me.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.033
Yeah, it's gonna
have to be now, buddy.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.102
We have some pretty big
decisions to make.

13:24.104 --> 13:28.439
Decisions that cannot wait,
given the... Circumstances.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.109
Mm.
Danielle, here,
will walk you through it.

13:32.044 --> 13:33.178
Let's sit.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.987
I won't sugarcoat it.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.290
The marbella's
in real trouble.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.958
Since these murders,

13:46.960 --> 13:48.226
The hotel has been
in a financial freefall.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.862
Occupancy is down
a staggering 42%,

13:50.864 --> 13:53.131
And now the banks are nervous
because we're so overextended,

13:53.133 --> 13:55.133
And... Well...

13:55.135 --> 13:56.334
Your father's missing.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.468
What are you suggesting?

13:57.470 --> 13:58.970
Emilio was
exploring options

13:58.972 --> 14:00.538
Of selling
part of the marbella.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.607
What?
Rafael...

14:02.609 --> 14:04.309
The marbella's losing money.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.543
This cannot be coming
as a surprise to you.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.245
Danielle:
Clearly, those offers have

14:07.247 --> 14:09.047
Gone away in light
of what's happened.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.282
Except for one.

14:18.123 --> 14:19.390
Lachlan: Look, this is not
what any of us want.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.359
We need to
be realistic.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.061
(fading): The marbella needs
cash to stay afloat,

14:23.063 --> 14:24.963
Your dad is gone...

14:24.965 --> 14:26.397
This company can help us.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.632
And they agree
to be hands off

14:27.634 --> 14:29.033
As long as we
hit targets.

14:32.404 --> 14:34.639
I-I will do some
due diligence on this,

14:34.641 --> 14:36.407
And I will think about it.

14:38.177 --> 14:39.244
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Rafael certainly</i>

14:39.246 --> 14:41.079
<i>Had a lot to consider.</i>

14:41.081 --> 14:43.448
<i>Yet all he could</i>
<i>think about was jane.</i>

14:43.450 --> 14:47.151
<i>And all jane could think about</i>
<i>was her decision.</i>

14:47.153 --> 14:48.219
No.

14:53.492 --> 14:55.326
Would you have an abortion if
something were seriously wrong?

14:55.328 --> 14:57.095
Xiomara!

14:57.097 --> 14:59.597
What? That's part of the
question, at least, right?

14:59.599 --> 15:01.666
Yeah, it is.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.534
And no.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.169
No, I wouldn't.
Not at this point.

15:06.505 --> 15:09.240
But on the other hand...

15:09.242 --> 15:10.508
If something <i>is</i> wrong,

15:10.510 --> 15:12.377
And I have a child
with special needs,

15:12.379 --> 15:13.578
Shouldn't I know now?

15:13.580 --> 15:15.647
So I can plan?

15:20.085 --> 15:21.319
Nothing.
You're right.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.121
Nothing.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.423
And the odds are...

15:25.425 --> 15:27.392
Something isn't wrong.

15:27.394 --> 15:28.559
That's what
the doctor said...

15:28.561 --> 15:30.094
Honey...

15:30.096 --> 15:31.362
No, it's...

15:31.364 --> 15:33.131
It's okay.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.399
I'm okay.

15:34.401 --> 15:37.435
It's just... Fresh.

15:40.239 --> 15:41.506
I'm not gonna do the amnio.

15:41.508 --> 15:42.540
Doesn't make sense.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.942
It changes nothing.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.978
And if there's something wrong,

15:46.980 --> 15:49.180
Then... We'll deal with it then.

15:52.384 --> 15:54.485
As long as you can let go, hon.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.057
I can.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.125
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And speaking of letting go...</i>

16:01.127 --> 16:02.427
Petra.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.362
You look beautiful.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.697
<i>...Or not quite...</i>

16:05.699 --> 16:07.098
What do you want, milos?

16:16.041 --> 16:17.375
Come on, petra.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.978
You know now,
your mother, she is liar.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.146
She lied about me cheating
to break us up!

16:22.148 --> 16:24.015
Well, you didn't have
to throw acid at her.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.050
(sighs heavily)
yes, I know.

16:26.052 --> 16:28.486
But let's be honest here:
I burned her cheek a little.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.687
She is fine.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.456
What she did
is much worse.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.257
Pretending she
couldn't walk,

16:33.259 --> 16:34.726
In order to manipulate you

16:34.728 --> 16:37.228
To take care of her
for the rest of her life!

16:37.230 --> 16:39.364
Milos... Stop.

16:40.566 --> 16:42.467
This isn't going
to happen, okay?

16:42.469 --> 16:43.568
(yelling):
Why not?!

16:45.270 --> 16:46.738
(inhales)

16:46.740 --> 16:48.172
Breathe in...

16:48.174 --> 16:49.307
(exhales)

16:49.309 --> 16:51.009
...Breathe out.

16:52.111 --> 16:53.644
What about couples therapy?

16:54.480 --> 16:55.480
I love you, petra.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.081
Milos...!

16:57.083 --> 16:58.249
Stop.

16:59.418 --> 17:01.419
You ruined my life.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.122
Your action--
that acid-- it set off

17:04.124 --> 17:05.490
A series of events that have
left me here, now,

17:05.492 --> 17:07.558
With no husband, no mother,

17:07.560 --> 17:09.093
No home, no money...

17:09.095 --> 17:10.595
I'm trying to fix that.

17:10.597 --> 17:13.498
Well, you can't.
What you can do,
is go back to prague.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.266
And stay away from me.

17:17.403 --> 17:19.070
I've moved on.

17:20.506 --> 17:22.507
Good-bye, milos.

17:33.152 --> 17:34.352
Breathe in...

17:36.522 --> 17:38.289
...Breathe out.

17:40.426 --> 17:41.626
So you're okay with that?

17:41.628 --> 17:42.693
Not doing the amnio?

17:42.695 --> 17:44.362
Yeah.

17:44.364 --> 17:45.763
I am.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.232
We'll just try to put it
out of our heads.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.534
Sure.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.171
So...

17:53.173 --> 17:54.472
I'll come over tomorrow

17:54.474 --> 17:56.140
After I grab
my cap and gown, okay?

17:56.142 --> 17:57.542
I can't wait.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.783
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Jane knew there was</i>
<i>only one way</i>

18:05.785 --> 18:07.785
<i>To get this out of her head.</i>

18:09.555 --> 18:11.122
<i>I meant, sleep, jane.</i>

18:11.124 --> 18:12.490
<i>Not the computer.</i>

18:21.700 --> 18:25.636
â™ª

18:42.154 --> 18:44.522

18:45.190 --> 18:46.257

(beeping continues,
more rapidly)

19:00.205 --> 19:02.907
â™ª

19:07.746 --> 19:09.547
(quietly):
Hi.

19:09.549 --> 19:10.781
(beep)

19:15.754 --> 19:20.525
â™ª

19:20.527 --> 19:21.559
(doorbell rings)

19:23.595 --> 19:25.830
Hey. You got your
cap and gown.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.466
You gonna try it on,
or is that bad luck,

19:28.468 --> 19:29.667
Like a wedding dress?

19:30.769 --> 19:33.404
Jane?

19:33.406 --> 19:36.474
I was up all night and I think
we should do the amnio.

19:36.476 --> 19:39.410
You know, this way,
if there's something wrong,

19:39.412 --> 19:41.612
Then I can research
whatever it is,

19:41.614 --> 19:43.781
And we could get
the best doctors,

19:43.783 --> 19:45.583
Figure out a plan,
prepare ourselves...

19:45.585 --> 19:46.717
Jane...
Yeah?

19:46.719 --> 19:47.718
I get it.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.253
We'll do the test.

19:49.255 --> 19:50.488
You're okay with it?

19:50.490 --> 19:51.556
Yes.

19:51.558 --> 19:52.757
Because it's
gonna be fine.

19:53.959 --> 19:55.693
They do amnios all the time.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.795
The odds are in our favor.

19:59.631 --> 20:01.399
And then we'll know.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.835
Okay?
Mm.

20:13.445 --> 20:14.679
Okay, guys, new session
starts next week,

20:14.681 --> 20:15.980
So don't forget
to tell your parents

20:15.982 --> 20:17.949
How much you love miss xo.

20:17.951 --> 20:18.950
Oh!

20:18.952 --> 20:19.850
Are these your students,

20:19.852 --> 20:20.851
The future entertainers?

20:20.853 --> 20:21.852
Yes.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.287
If you don't mind.

20:23.289 --> 20:24.522
Of course
I will speak to them.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.390
Hello, children.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.626
For those of you with parents
who don't own a television,

20:28.628 --> 20:29.860
My name is

20:29.862 --> 20:31.896
Rogelio de la vega,

20:31.898 --> 20:33.731
And I would like to talk to you
about show business.

20:33.733 --> 20:34.932
Rogelio...
It's terrible.

20:34.934 --> 20:37.268
One day you're on top,
and the next, bam!

20:37.270 --> 20:38.936
They take it away!

20:40.839 --> 20:42.406
All right.

20:42.408 --> 20:45.009
New session starts next week.

20:46.378 --> 20:47.378
What is wrong with you?

20:47.380 --> 20:49.380
Those kids are ten!

20:49.382 --> 20:50.715
I apologize.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.550
I may have let my mood
affect my advice.

20:52.552 --> 20:53.985
I will talk to them
next class.

20:53.987 --> 20:56.287
Oh, you are done
coming to class.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.658
What happened at the audition?

21:00.660 --> 21:02.293
Apparently they did not find

21:02.295 --> 21:03.961
(american accent):
My american accent believable.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.030
Okay, so you'll get 'em
next time.

21:10.535 --> 21:12.370
What happened
to the rogelio

21:12.372 --> 21:14.872
Who fought for 39 years
to get famous?

21:14.874 --> 21:17.375
He's still here.
Exactly.

21:17.377 --> 21:18.643
And he will persevere.

21:18.645 --> 21:19.877
And it was 34 years ago.

21:19.879 --> 21:22.013
Hmm?

21:22.015 --> 21:23.981
35. That's as high
as I'm going.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.549
Good.

21:25.551 --> 21:26.984
So call your agent,
tell her to keep looking.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.352
Open up the search.

21:28.354 --> 21:30.888
Oh, good, I need to
talk to you guys.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.890
And abuela.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.959
And I know this is
not what you want

21:34.961 --> 21:36.927
Or necessarily something
you would do,

21:36.929 --> 21:37.995
But I need to know,

21:37.997 --> 21:40.031
So I can prepare and plan.

21:40.033 --> 21:41.599
And, yes, there are risks,

21:41.601 --> 21:43.834
But it's also
a pretty common procedure.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.903
You just need to
sign here and here.

21:45.905 --> 21:46.904
This is a waiver saying that

21:46.906 --> 21:48.372
You understand
all the risks

21:48.374 --> 21:50.007
Involved in
the procedure.

21:50.009 --> 21:52.009
And I know myself.
I know I won't let it go.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.077
How is this doctor?

21:53.079 --> 21:54.945
I trust him.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.947
How are <i>you</i> feeling,
dr. Hillcroft?

21:56.949 --> 21:58.683
Did you get enough sleep?
Did you have breakfast?

21:58.685 --> 21:59.917
(laughing):
I'm great, jane.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.419
I had an omelette.

22:01.421 --> 22:02.586
Mm.

22:02.588 --> 22:03.754
When will you do it?

22:03.756 --> 22:05.690
Tomorrow.

22:05.692 --> 22:08.426
Okay, you'll take it easy
for the rest of the day,

22:08.428 --> 22:09.860
You'll be fine for graduation.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.662
Well, no, actually.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.764
Qi have to be on bed rest for
48 hours after the procedure.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.933
So I will be missing
the ceremony.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.435
What?

22:19.004 --> 22:20.104
I'm still graduating.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.639
It's just a ceremony.

22:21.641 --> 22:22.673
You can't do it after?

22:22.675 --> 22:24.075
No. Dr. Hillcroft

22:24.077 --> 22:25.609
Is going out of town
and he's booked solid,

22:25.611 --> 22:26.977
So they're squeezing me in.

22:26.979 --> 22:28.479
Just take a couple
of deep breaths

22:28.481 --> 22:30.047
And relax, okay?

22:32.617 --> 22:33.984
Are you nervous?

22:33.986 --> 22:36.354
A little.

22:36.356 --> 22:37.855
You know I hate needles.

22:38.957 --> 22:41.092
I just need to have faith.

22:42.127 --> 22:43.527
And I do.

22:48.834 --> 22:50.801
But will you come with me?

22:50.803 --> 22:52.002
We got a full house today, huh?

22:56.808 --> 22:59.944
Do-do you mind counting down?

22:59.946 --> 23:02.480
I just like to be prepared.

23:02.482 --> 23:03.547
Okay.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.983
Here we go.
Uh-huh.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.618
Three...

23:07.620 --> 23:09.687
Two...

23:13.058 --> 23:14.825
...One.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.761
Rose:
<i>What?</i>

23:16.763 --> 23:18.095
An affair?

23:18.097 --> 23:20.598
<i>That although rose</i>
<i>was only playing</i>

23:20.600 --> 23:22.600
<i>The part of a concerned wife,</i>

23:22.602 --> 23:24.735
<i>Her surprise at the affair</i>
<i>was 100% real.</i>

23:24.737 --> 23:25.970
Mrs. Solano,
are you okay?

23:25.972 --> 23:27.938
Sorry.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.674
It's just... Hard,

23:30.676 --> 23:32.576
Finding out
you don't know someone

23:32.578 --> 23:33.944
Like you thought you did.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.045
Hmm.
I assume

23:35.047 --> 23:36.781
You've talked to this woman?

23:36.783 --> 23:38.149
We're working on that, actually.

23:39.518 --> 23:41.018
So the night of
the bellboy's death,

23:41.020 --> 23:43.154
You told us
that emilio was working

23:43.156 --> 23:44.922
All night at the office,
correct?

23:44.924 --> 23:47.491
Yes. That's what he told me.
I didn't see him again

23:47.493 --> 23:48.993
Until the next morning.

23:48.995 --> 23:51.095
I mean, I had no reason
to believe he was lying.

23:51.097 --> 23:52.863
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Not to mention,</i>
<i>if the police thought</i>

23:52.865 --> 23:54.131
<i>Emilio was in the hotel</i>
<i>that night,</i>

23:54.133 --> 23:55.466
<i>They might also think</i>

23:55.468 --> 23:56.700
<i>Emilio was the one</i>

23:56.702 --> 23:58.035
<i>Who killed the bellboy.</i>

23:58.037 --> 23:59.804
Right. Well, we're gonna
go talk to her.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.572
See what she
has to say.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.874
And, uh, I'll probably be back
with questions later.

24:03.876 --> 24:06.477
Thank you, detective.

24:23.195 --> 24:24.562
Hey.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.530
We're gonna need
to move up the timeline.

24:33.238 --> 24:34.705
All right.
You doing okay?

24:34.707 --> 24:36.907
Yeah.

24:36.909 --> 24:39.109
Dr. Hillcroft said
that it went well.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.245
Good.

24:41.247 --> 24:44.081
Can I get you
anything?

24:44.083 --> 24:45.583
Maybe orange juice?

24:45.585 --> 24:48.018
I haven't felt the baby kick
in a while.

24:48.020 --> 24:49.620
If I drink orange juice,

24:49.622 --> 24:51.088
It usually makes the baby
move around.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.523
Okay.
Okay.

24:52.525 --> 24:54.191
You got it.

24:54.193 --> 24:55.226
For... For now,

24:55.228 --> 24:57.928
You just get comfy.

24:59.030 --> 25:01.098
Thank you.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.938
(sighs)

25:07.940 --> 25:09.240
So, did you think
about my plan?

25:09.242 --> 25:12.009
Yes. Did you think about
what I said about your plan?

25:12.011 --> 25:14.111
Yes.
And I think you're wrong.

25:14.113 --> 25:15.613
I think she'll love it.

25:17.015 --> 25:18.516
So you gonna help?

25:18.518 --> 25:19.850
Sure. I'll help.

25:21.286 --> 25:24.255
But she's not gonna love it.

25:25.223 --> 25:28.559
Why isn't the baby moving?

25:28.561 --> 25:30.294
You felt kicks earlier,
when we were leaving.

25:30.296 --> 25:31.962
I'm sure it's fine.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.531
Babies need sleep, too.

25:33.533 --> 25:34.865
I hope so.
Hey.

25:36.668 --> 25:38.168
You just need to relax

25:38.170 --> 25:39.603
And try to sleep.

25:39.605 --> 25:41.238
Yeah, I know.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.306
You're right.

25:42.308 --> 25:44.542
Ugh, but I can't.

25:44.544 --> 25:45.576
Can you talk to me
about something?

25:45.578 --> 25:47.077
It'll help me get tired.

25:47.079 --> 25:49.013
I'll try to not take that
as an insult.

25:49.015 --> 25:50.714
You know what I mean.

25:50.716 --> 25:53.918
Just... Get me to stop
thinking about it, please.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.853
Okay.

25:55.855 --> 25:58.556
Um...

25:58.558 --> 25:59.990
I can tell you that I made

25:59.992 --> 26:02.259
A decision about the hotel.

26:02.261 --> 26:04.295
I'm going to sell part of it.
Really?

26:04.297 --> 26:06.263
The investor checks out,
his company's hands-off,

26:06.265 --> 26:08.265
And we need the cash.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.267
And I think that's what
my father would do.

26:10.269 --> 26:12.636
Sounds like a good call.

26:13.805 --> 26:15.606
That all you got?

26:15.608 --> 26:16.907
What?

26:16.909 --> 26:18.609
Come on, I need you
to talk to me

26:18.611 --> 26:20.678
For, like, the next 42 hours.

26:21.646 --> 26:23.948
Just so you know,

26:23.950 --> 26:26.350
I think you made
the right choice with the amnio.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.953
Just think about how stressed
you would have been not knowing.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.788
And we've still got
five months

26:30.790 --> 26:32.323
Of this pregnancy left.

26:32.325 --> 26:33.991
That's a long time.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.333
He seems to really
care about her.

26:42.335 --> 26:44.668
He's so excited
about this thing tomorrow.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.170
He was in target for two hours.

26:50.842 --> 26:53.110
(both laughing)

26:56.615 --> 26:57.848
(tv turns off)

26:57.850 --> 26:59.650
Can I ask you a question?

27:02.654 --> 27:03.821
It's about dad.

27:05.657 --> 27:08.058
How come you never dated
since he died?

27:08.060 --> 27:10.260
I mean,
don't you ever get lonely?

27:13.865 --> 27:16.266
That's not what I mean, ma.

27:19.237 --> 27:20.304
But why?

27:47.432 --> 27:49.266
Mom...

27:49.268 --> 27:50.768
That's not your fault.

27:59.244 --> 28:01.278
I get that, ma.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.347
But do you think that
that's what he'd want?

28:03.349 --> 28:04.381
Because I don't.

28:04.383 --> 28:06.750
And remember,

28:06.752 --> 28:08.318
I knew dad
pretty well.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.187
And what I remember...

28:10.189 --> 28:13.323
What he wanted most,
more than anything,

28:13.325 --> 28:15.693
Was for you to be happy.

28:17.195 --> 28:18.395
Look...

28:18.397 --> 28:21.098
(laughs)

28:21.100 --> 28:24.168
...You don't have to date
the exercycle guy,

28:24.170 --> 28:26.470
But maybe just

28:26.472 --> 28:28.872
Be open to the idea

28:28.874 --> 28:31.241
Of an exercycle guy, okay?

28:32.177 --> 28:33.410
(sniffles)

28:33.412 --> 28:34.745
(clears throat)

28:39.250 --> 28:41.752
(sighs)

28:41.754 --> 28:43.487
I made a mistake.

28:45.790 --> 28:46.857
What?

28:46.859 --> 28:49.093
With the amnio.

28:49.095 --> 28:50.427
I shouldn't have done it.

28:50.429 --> 28:51.795
If something

28:51.797 --> 28:53.430
Goes wrong tonight,

28:53.432 --> 28:55.265
Or in the next...

28:55.267 --> 28:57.301
41 hours...

28:57.303 --> 28:59.236
It won't.
It could.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.472
And it would be my fault.

29:01.474 --> 29:03.340
Like you said,
I would have stressed

29:03.342 --> 29:04.775
If we didn't take the test,

29:04.777 --> 29:06.810
And that was about me,
not the baby.

29:06.812 --> 29:09.279
And that is not a good reason.

29:09.281 --> 29:10.447
It's not the only reason.

29:10.449 --> 29:12.182
I just feel like

29:12.184 --> 29:13.450
This was my first parenting test

29:13.452 --> 29:14.485
And I failed.

29:14.487 --> 29:17.154
I made it about my needs,

29:17.156 --> 29:19.823
My own anxieties,
not about the baby.

29:19.825 --> 29:22.459
You also gave up going
to your own graduation

29:22.461 --> 29:24.194
Without a thought.

29:26.865 --> 29:29.366
Look, jane, there's no
right or wrong answer.

29:29.368 --> 29:30.868
Maybe.

29:34.339 --> 29:35.906
But would you forgive me

29:35.908 --> 29:37.407
If something went wrong?

29:37.409 --> 29:39.176
Oh, yes.

29:39.178 --> 29:41.545
Of course.

29:41.547 --> 29:42.813
And it won't.

29:42.815 --> 29:45.048
It's going
to be okay.

29:45.050 --> 29:47.551
I hope so.

29:47.553 --> 29:50.354
Look, we can't go back.

29:50.356 --> 29:51.789
We're here, now.

29:51.791 --> 29:53.857
We did the test.

29:53.859 --> 29:55.259
You gotta let it go.

29:55.261 --> 29:56.527
Yeah.
(sniffles)

29:56.529 --> 29:58.162
That's not exactly
my strong suit.

29:58.164 --> 29:59.396
I know.

29:59.398 --> 30:00.864
I know it's hard.

30:00.866 --> 30:03.567
(gasps)

30:03.569 --> 30:05.169
What? Wait, what is it?

30:05.171 --> 30:08.272
It's good.

30:08.274 --> 30:10.507
The baby just kicked.

30:10.509 --> 30:13.243
Oh, that's great.

30:13.245 --> 30:15.579
Yes, it is.

30:24.255 --> 30:26.023
I feel like you're judging me.

30:26.025 --> 30:27.591
You have no right to judge me.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.259
Miss devore,
no one is judging you.

30:29.261 --> 30:31.094
Okay?
We just want the truth.

30:31.096 --> 30:32.830
Can you tell us
where emilio solano was

30:32.832 --> 30:33.897
The night of
the bellboy's murder?

30:33.899 --> 30:36.466
Yeah. He was on his boat.
With me.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.101
And you can actually prove that?

30:38.103 --> 30:39.603
Well, I have pictures

30:39.605 --> 30:41.538
With the date and time on them.
Selfies.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.307
Can we see those?

30:43.309 --> 30:44.908
Um... Sure.

30:44.910 --> 30:46.610
They're a little nsfw,

30:46.612 --> 30:48.312
If you know what I mean.

30:50.982 --> 30:52.416
Regardless, we'll have
to get them verified.

30:52.418 --> 30:54.084
Did you spend
the whole night on the boat?

30:54.086 --> 30:55.919
Yeah. Until about 2:00.

30:55.921 --> 30:57.321
He called his wife
and told her

30:57.323 --> 30:58.922
He would be out
on the water late.

30:58.924 --> 31:00.390
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Hold the phone.</i>

31:00.392 --> 31:01.925
<i>Rose told the police</i>
<i>she thought</i>

31:01.927 --> 31:03.627
<i>Emilio was in his office</i>
<i>all night.</i>

31:03.629 --> 31:05.362
Wait, so he told mrs. Solano

31:05.364 --> 31:06.597
He was on the boat?

31:06.599 --> 31:09.199
Yes. Only he said
he was by himself.

31:10.401 --> 31:12.336
Don't judge us.

31:12.338 --> 31:14.404
He thought she may have
been cheating on him, too.

31:14.406 --> 31:15.606
She was always
disappearing

31:15.608 --> 31:17.641
And not telling him
where she was.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.209
Latin lover narrator:
<i>If a lightbulb could go on</i>

31:19.211 --> 31:22.212
<i>Over michael's head, it would.</i>

31:22.214 --> 31:24.648
Sorry, it was kind
of dark in here.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.950
Can you take miss devore
to give her official statement?

31:26.952 --> 31:29.653
Have someone find rose for us
right away? Thank you so much.

31:29.655 --> 31:31.321
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It was all coming</i>
<i>together for michael.</i>

31:34.926 --> 31:36.927
Rose had all the same
access as emilio.

31:36.929 --> 31:39.129
The payment to the plastic
surgeon from emilio's account?

31:41.499 --> 31:42.900
Rose could have
done that, too.

31:42.902 --> 31:45.502
Look, look, the letter
from luisa to rose

31:45.504 --> 31:46.937
That rafael gave us.

31:46.939 --> 31:48.939
Luisa thought her father
killed the bellboy

31:48.941 --> 31:50.941
Because the corkscrew was
missing from his room.

31:50.943 --> 31:52.643
<i>But that was rosa's room, too.</i>

31:52.645 --> 31:54.945
She designed
the recovery suites.

31:54.947 --> 31:56.580
Just wanted to drop off
some ideas

31:56.582 --> 31:58.582
For the upgrade
to the recovery spa.

31:58.584 --> 32:01.385
She planned it
from the beginning.

32:01.387 --> 32:03.654
What is "sin rostro"?

32:03.656 --> 32:05.155
She was setting
emilio up.

32:05.157 --> 32:07.624
What if your father
is sin rostro?

32:07.626 --> 32:09.626
She must have led rafael
to the construction site

32:09.628 --> 32:11.361
Where he saw the
subcontractor.

32:11.363 --> 32:12.696
What is it?

32:12.698 --> 32:14.598
Rafael:
I'm pretty sure

32:14.600 --> 32:15.666
That's the subcontractor
who built the tunnels.

32:15.668 --> 32:17.467
Rafael told us

32:17.469 --> 32:19.303
The bellboy's last words
were "sin rostro."

32:19.305 --> 32:21.705
He wasn't naming
his killer,

32:21.707 --> 32:23.006
He was identifying her.

32:23.008 --> 32:24.641
(whispering):
Sin...

32:24.643 --> 32:27.945
Rostro.

32:29.314 --> 32:30.514
You're not gonna
believe this.

32:30.516 --> 32:32.215
Rose is gone, and
the room's empty.

32:35.687 --> 32:37.387
Oh, my god.

32:43.995 --> 32:46.396
(moaning)

32:46.398 --> 32:49.466
â™ª

32:51.002 --> 32:52.035
(groans)

32:54.639 --> 32:56.573
Oh...

32:56.575 --> 33:00.978
You guys, this is so
incredibly cheesy.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.579
See, I told you
she'd say that.

33:02.581 --> 33:04.047
It's not cheesy,
it's sweet.

33:04.049 --> 33:05.549
Mm.
I warned him.

33:07.518 --> 33:09.486
Rogelio: Okay, stop it,
stop it, it's not cheesy.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.588
And I think rafael is right
to want to mark

33:11.590 --> 33:13.991
This extraordinary occasion
of jane's graduation.

33:13.993 --> 33:17.527
And as your keynote speaker,
I have prepared a few words.

33:17.529 --> 33:19.463
(clears throat)
jane,

33:19.465 --> 33:22.432
It is an honor and a privilege
for me to be here today.

33:22.434 --> 33:25.068
It's a moment that I've waited

33:25.070 --> 33:28.071
For the two-and-a-half months
I've known you.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.374
I myself

33:30.376 --> 33:32.376
Never attended
college, no.

33:32.378 --> 33:35.078
Preferring instead
the school of hard knocks,

33:35.080 --> 33:36.713
Where there are
no weekends off...

33:36.715 --> 33:39.549
(cell phone rings)

33:39.551 --> 33:41.585
I believe I asked you
to turn off your phones.

33:42.553 --> 33:43.553
Oh, it's mine.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.055
Sorry, yeah.

33:45.057 --> 33:46.323
It's my agent.

33:46.325 --> 33:47.591
I'm gonna send it
to voice mail.

33:47.593 --> 33:48.592
You do that.

33:48.594 --> 33:49.793
It's my turn to speak.

33:49.795 --> 33:52.062
Mom.
What?

33:52.064 --> 33:54.064
You said to save it
for graduation day.

33:54.066 --> 33:55.732
It's graduation day.

33:57.602 --> 33:59.236
Okay.

33:59.238 --> 34:03.240
First, of course,
I'm so proud of you.

34:03.242 --> 34:06.810
But that's nothing new because
I'm always proud of you, jane.

34:06.812 --> 34:08.445
I am.

34:08.447 --> 34:11.782
Of the person you are
and the choices you make

34:11.784 --> 34:15.585
And the way you live your life,
it's inspiring, I swear.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.587
And I don't know how you do it.

34:18.589 --> 34:20.590
And now you're
having a baby.

34:20.592 --> 34:23.593
And I really hope that you get
to have a moment like this

34:23.595 --> 34:24.761
With your kid one day,

34:24.763 --> 34:27.631
So that you get
to feel the way

34:27.633 --> 34:29.099
I'm feeling about you right now.

34:29.101 --> 34:30.467
Mom...

34:30.469 --> 34:31.468
I love you.

34:31.470 --> 34:33.770
I love you, too.

34:33.772 --> 34:36.339
I thought you said
it was cheesy.

34:36.341 --> 34:38.575
It is, shut up.

35:06.771 --> 35:10.607
All right, so what's the secret
to being a great mom, huh?

35:10.609 --> 35:12.609
(chuckles)

35:12.611 --> 35:15.245
Uh, I didn't have
to do much, janey.

35:15.247 --> 35:18.248
You were the kind of kid that
the best thing that I could do

35:18.250 --> 35:22.319
Was just let go and watch you
figure things out for yourself.

35:26.557 --> 35:27.557
(laughs)

35:27.559 --> 35:29.392
Mommy...

35:29.394 --> 35:30.460
Abuela, that's mean.

35:34.232 --> 35:35.432
Anything?

35:35.434 --> 35:36.600
Still checking
entrances and exits.

35:36.602 --> 35:37.868
Nothing yet.
Damn it.

35:37.870 --> 35:39.469
We swept the tunnels
and the secret room.

35:39.471 --> 35:40.637
Guest rooms?
All of them?
Yeah, of course.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.272
Stop! Y-you,
rewind, rewind.

35:42.274 --> 35:43.740
Okay, right there.

35:43.742 --> 35:45.742
That truck backs up all
the way into the overhang.

35:45.744 --> 35:47.744
If someone were to get
in the back of that,

35:47.746 --> 35:49.146
They wouldn't be on camera,
would they?

35:49.148 --> 35:50.580
No, I guess not.

35:50.582 --> 35:51.648
Is that a normal
hotel delivery truck?

35:51.650 --> 35:53.450
Does that say culter linens?

35:53.452 --> 35:55.752
Yeah, but the trucks
are usually shorter.

35:55.754 --> 35:57.354
That's got to be
how rose escaped.

35:57.356 --> 36:00.223
Send out an apb on that
license plate right away.

36:01.692 --> 36:03.193
Here I am.

36:03.195 --> 36:05.362
Hey, would you excuse us?

36:05.364 --> 36:06.830
Sorry. My god,
I'm so excited

36:06.832 --> 36:08.598
To leave, I can't
even tell you.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.267
Yes, so here's
the thing.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.268
Um...

36:11.270 --> 36:13.436
You're not coming.

36:13.438 --> 36:14.838
(laughs)
what?

36:14.840 --> 36:16.273
You never were.

36:16.275 --> 36:17.774
And I want you
out of the hotel.

36:17.776 --> 36:19.209
Good news--

36:19.211 --> 36:21.278
You're already packed.

36:23.414 --> 36:25.248
I-I don't understand.

36:25.250 --> 36:26.683
Really?

36:26.685 --> 36:27.684
Because I warned you.

36:27.686 --> 36:28.919
Karma's a bitch.

36:31.355 --> 36:34.291
And then you screwed
me over again.

36:34.293 --> 36:35.825
Are you surprised that you
could be outmaneuvered?

36:35.827 --> 36:37.827
No.

36:37.829 --> 36:39.829
I'm surprised you could
be this awful.

36:39.831 --> 36:41.898
I'm awful?

36:43.834 --> 36:45.802
The way you left
me for rafael?

36:45.804 --> 36:46.670
That was years ago.

36:46.672 --> 36:48.672
So get over it?

36:48.674 --> 36:50.373
Is that what
you're saying?

36:51.542 --> 36:53.810
Great news--

36:55.746 --> 36:57.214
I'm over it.

37:00.851 --> 37:02.852
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, petra.</i>

37:02.854 --> 37:05.422
<i>She really knows</i>
<i>how to pick 'em.</i>

37:10.828 --> 37:12.329
Hey, do you want
any more cereal?

37:12.331 --> 37:13.463
Or any water or anything?

37:13.465 --> 37:15.298
I'm good.

37:15.300 --> 37:17.934
Just enjoying this chair.

37:17.936 --> 37:20.570
Didn't realize how much
I'd miss sitting in chairs.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.806
I am just happy
that these 48 hours are over.

37:22.808 --> 37:24.507
They were stressful.
(chuckles)

37:24.509 --> 37:26.376
And now we just have the stress
of waiting two weeks

37:26.378 --> 37:27.877
For the results.

37:29.847 --> 37:32.649
Let's really try
not to stress.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.417
Part of my new
parenting philosophy--

37:34.419 --> 37:35.719
Letting go a little.

37:35.721 --> 37:36.720
All right.

37:36.722 --> 37:37.721
Mm-hmm.

37:37.723 --> 37:38.922
I'm in.

37:39.890 --> 37:42.525
And I will raise you one.
Hmm.

37:42.527 --> 37:44.728
In the craziness
of our appointment,

37:44.730 --> 37:46.863
We forgot
to find out the sex.

37:48.666 --> 37:49.966
You're right.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.968
So are you willing
to let it go

37:51.970 --> 37:53.970
And just
be surprised?

37:53.972 --> 37:54.971
You trapped me.

37:54.973 --> 37:56.973
What's your answer?

37:56.975 --> 37:58.708
Fine, I'll let it go.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.877
Really?
No biggie.

38:00.879 --> 38:05.048
Especially 'cause
it's 99.9% a girl.

38:05.050 --> 38:06.650
I don't know
about that.
Mm.

38:06.652 --> 38:07.951
We'll have
to wait and see.

38:10.855 --> 38:12.856
So how much was it per night?

38:12.858 --> 38:13.857
No.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.292
No ocean view.

38:15.294 --> 38:16.526
Hello, petra.

38:18.496 --> 38:20.830
I'll call you back.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.801
What do you want,
milos?

38:24.803 --> 38:26.803
I have to talk to you
about lachlan.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.305
I don't trust him.

38:28.307 --> 38:29.773
So I had my people
do some digging.

38:29.775 --> 38:31.941
What people?

38:31.943 --> 38:33.910
Important, expensive people,
but that's not the point.

38:33.912 --> 38:37.714
Whatever, look,
lachlan and I, we...

38:37.716 --> 38:39.549
We've broken up.

38:39.551 --> 38:40.817
Not that it's any
of your business.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.786
But it is.

38:42.788 --> 38:45.789
Because lachlan works
at the marbella,

38:45.791 --> 38:48.925
And I just bought
into the hotel.

38:48.927 --> 38:51.461
What?

38:51.463 --> 38:55.765
33% precisely.

38:57.368 --> 39:00.870
Wait, lachlan said that-that
was a-a british company.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.405
Yes, a family corporation.

39:02.407 --> 39:03.907
My family.

39:06.410 --> 39:09.779
I had them buy
it for you, petra.

39:09.781 --> 39:12.382
You said I ruined
your life,

39:12.384 --> 39:14.517
I need to make amends.

39:15.920 --> 39:18.555
And you're just...
What, giving this to me?

39:18.557 --> 39:19.956
No strings attached?

39:19.958 --> 39:22.592
I did not say there
were no strings.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.594
We will own it together,

39:24.596 --> 39:27.964
So we will continue to
be in each other's lives.

39:29.934 --> 39:32.135
So...

39:32.137 --> 39:33.870
What do you think?

39:37.575 --> 39:39.676
Rogelio:
Hey.

39:39.678 --> 39:41.077
How's jane feeling?

39:41.079 --> 39:43.747
Great. She's resting,
baby's still moving.

39:43.749 --> 39:45.749
Great day all-around.

39:45.751 --> 39:47.751
I'm happy to
hear that.

39:47.753 --> 39:49.753
It was a great day
for me, as well.

39:49.755 --> 39:51.955
Uh, I took your advice,

39:51.957 --> 39:54.424
And I put what little
ego I have aside,

39:54.426 --> 39:58.428
And opened myself up for
jobs I was not considering.

39:58.430 --> 40:00.930
And I got an offer,
immediately.

40:00.932 --> 40:02.932
(gasps) oh,
that's amazing.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.701
I'm so happy for you.

40:04.703 --> 40:06.703
It's for a brand-new
telenovela.

40:06.705 --> 40:09.172
I will be playing
the lead, obviously.

40:09.174 --> 40:12.175
See what happens when you
let go of things a little?

40:12.177 --> 40:14.010
Good stuff happens.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.545
Can I say
I told you so?

40:15.547 --> 40:17.814
Yes, you may.

40:17.816 --> 40:19.082
(laughs)

40:19.084 --> 40:23.086
Though, there's
a larger issue.

40:23.088 --> 40:26.956
This particular show
shoots in-in mexico.

40:26.958 --> 40:29.159
So if I were
to take it,

40:29.161 --> 40:31.161
I-I would be gone.

40:31.163 --> 40:33.029
F-for a year and a half.

40:34.999 --> 40:38.635
Oh. I see.

40:38.637 --> 40:42.038
That's why I told them
I would think about it.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.873
There's a lot
to consider.

40:43.875 --> 40:47.110
Okay, well...

40:47.112 --> 40:49.012
It's still great
news, right?

40:50.881 --> 40:52.949
Congratulations.

41:01.725 --> 41:04.027
Come here,
you got to see something.

41:04.029 --> 41:05.929
Nadine, I can't look at
any more security footage.

41:05.931 --> 41:07.464
Humor me.

41:07.466 --> 41:10.066
It's footage from the night
roman zazo died.

41:11.602 --> 41:13.002
I remember.

41:13.004 --> 41:14.637
The ice, the splat,
the blood.

41:14.639 --> 41:16.973
Yeah, but look at...

41:16.975 --> 41:18.608
This.

41:18.610 --> 41:21.244
It's rose solano.

41:21.246 --> 41:23.079
Seconds before zazo
was impaled.

41:23.081 --> 41:24.681
She couldn't have
killed him.

41:24.683 --> 41:27.650
And emilio is right
there with her.

41:29.053 --> 41:30.653
So the bellboy did it.

41:30.655 --> 41:32.088
Then rose stuck a
corkscrew in his neck

41:32.090 --> 41:33.690
To make sure
he didn't talk.

41:33.692 --> 41:34.924
That's what
I thought.

41:34.926 --> 41:35.992
But look.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.061
Also seconds before.

41:43.033 --> 41:45.668
So who the hell
killed roman zazo?

41:45.670 --> 41:47.604
Latin lover narrator:
<i>A very good question.</i>

41:47.606 --> 41:50.006
Hey!

41:50.008 --> 41:51.641
Did everything go okay?

41:51.643 --> 41:53.643
Yeah.

41:53.645 --> 41:55.712
Great.

41:57.114 --> 41:58.948
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Next question?</i>

41:58.950 --> 42:00.984
