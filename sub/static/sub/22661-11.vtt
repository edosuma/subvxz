WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:05.773
Guys, this...
is a dishwasher. Okay?

00:08.809 --> 00:12.480
This is not
a dishwasher.

00:12.513 --> 00:15.449
We know what a dishwasher is.

00:15.483 --> 00:18.786
Okay. Well, then, show me by
putting your dishes in there.

00:18.819 --> 00:20.354
It's full of
wine glasses.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.525
When you have kids,
you'll understand.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.160
Come on.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.064
Hi.

00:30.098 --> 00:31.365
Hey.

00:31.399 --> 00:32.633
How was Bingo with your mom?

00:37.838 --> 00:39.273
How do you think it was?

00:39.307 --> 00:40.674
Four hours stuck in a hot room

00:40.708 --> 00:42.543
with a bunch of senior citizens.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.747
And it took forever
to call each number.

00:46.780 --> 00:47.848
"B9."

00:47.881 --> 00:49.083
:
"What?!"

00:50.451 --> 00:51.385
"B9."

00:51.419 --> 00:52.420
:
"What?!"

00:54.288 --> 00:58.426
And then this 90-year-old
woman grabbed my thigh.

00:58.459 --> 01:01.595
And I said "Hey, hands off"
and she said "What?"

01:03.297 --> 01:05.399
Well, you've always been catnip
for the blue hairs.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.435
Yeah. Oh!

01:07.468 --> 01:09.503
I did finally
win a prize.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.372
A pill organizer.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.674
But I think it's used,

01:13.707 --> 01:15.209
'cause there's an aspirin
in Friday.

01:16.810 --> 01:19.480
I'll put it with the compression
socks you won last week.

01:21.415 --> 01:24.852
Ever since my mom got on this
Bingo kick, it's every week.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.487
My dad won't take her,

01:26.520 --> 01:28.289
you won't take her...

01:28.322 --> 01:30.491
Wait.
Why don't you ever take her?

01:30.524 --> 01:32.826
Well, I told her
I don't like Bingo.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.397
I may have also said
that you love it.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.670
So you did this to me?

01:42.703 --> 01:44.405
Bingo.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.342
Honey, you know,
your mom is just

01:48.376 --> 01:50.344
sitting around that house
all day with your dad.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.480
She's probably bored
out of her mind.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.415
That's what it is!

01:55.383 --> 01:57.251
Look at the big
brain on you.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.354
To stop Bingo at night,

02:00.388 --> 02:03.424
we need to find a way
to tire her out during the day.

02:05.193 --> 02:06.894
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.629
Don't you have volunteers
at the hospital?

02:08.662 --> 02:10.631
Actually, your mom
would love that.

02:10.664 --> 02:13.567
Yeah. Why not give her
to the sick people?

02:15.503 --> 02:18.239
They're already not having fun.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.474
Okay, I'll get her signed up.

02:20.508 --> 02:21.642
Great. Great.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.577
Oh. And as a thank you,
please accept this

02:23.611 --> 02:25.813
state-of-the-art bunion shaver.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.681
Ooh.
Really?

02:29.950 --> 02:33.187
I was on a hot streak.

02:36.624 --> 02:39.527
Oh, I'm so nervous.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.329
My first day
as a volunteer.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.397
Hey. Dropped the kids off
at school.

02:43.431 --> 02:46.800
Uh, fair warning, Teddy lost his
hard-boiled egg in your car.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.537
I moved the seat back
to try to find it,

02:49.570 --> 02:50.838
but I think
I may have just crushed it.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.506
Look at me, sweetie.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.543
I'm a working girl,
like Mary Tyler Moore.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.745
If I had a hat,
I'd throw it in the air.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.483
She knows she's not
getting paid, right?

03:02.516 --> 03:05.586
Hey, I took her off your hands.
Don't rock the boat.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.521
All right, look.
Just keep her moving

03:07.555 --> 03:08.822
so she's too tired for Bingo.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.424
Maybe don't tell her
about the elevators.

03:10.458 --> 03:13.361
Hmm?

03:13.394 --> 03:15.863
: I solve problems,
that's what I do.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.303
You still scream
like a little girl, son.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.871
What are you doing here?

03:23.904 --> 03:25.606
I don't want to sit alone
in an empty house,

03:25.639 --> 03:26.907
so I'm with you now.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.309
Wha... Mom's going
to be volunteering

03:28.342 --> 03:29.477
at the hospital
every day.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.944
Then I'll be with you every day.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.713
But I have to go to work.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.282
Great, we'll go to work.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.750
We just need to stop off

03:36.784 --> 03:38.452
and get me
my morning Dr. Pepper.

03:38.486 --> 03:40.621
There's a can in the fridge.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.556
Oh, no, no.
It's gotta be draft,

03:42.590 --> 03:43.957
with chewable ice,
in a foam cup,

03:43.991 --> 03:45.926
the way the good Lord intended.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.761
Ah.
I know where we can get it.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.430
There's a place
out by the airport.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.698
Oh, great. Yeah.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.301
I was just thinking how much I
want to drive to the airport.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.639
All right.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.641
After we get
your airport soda,

04:00.674 --> 04:02.510
we need to run by
the lumberyard.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.844
What about breakfast?

04:06.914 --> 04:08.716
Why didn't you make yourself
something in the house?

04:08.749 --> 04:11.419
I don't cook my own food.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.553
Somebody does it for me.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.388
I'm grandfathered into that.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.424
What does that mean?

04:16.457 --> 04:19.493
It means I risked my life
fighting commies,

04:19.527 --> 04:21.028
so somebody else
makes my chow.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.605
You hear that?
Hmm?

04:31.639 --> 04:32.973
You hear?

04:33.006 --> 04:34.074
Huh?

04:34.107 --> 04:35.509
You know what
that sound is?
Huh?

04:35.543 --> 04:37.578
That means put
your seat belt on.

04:37.611 --> 04:41.415
I don't have to do that, I'm
grandfathered into that, too.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.453
I'll just fly safely
through the windshield.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.756
*

04:57.631 --> 04:59.099
How 'bout this soda, Donny?
Oh...

04:59.132 --> 05:00.568
Great job, Pop.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.102
It's delicious...

05:02.135 --> 05:04.104
and it looks like
it made Adam really mad.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.706
I can't hear you.

05:05.739 --> 05:08.809
All I can hear is
"bong bong bong."

05:08.842 --> 05:10.944
Oh, Adam,
the insulation guys called.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.112
They can meet you
at 9:00 tomorrow.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.647
Okay, great.

05:13.681 --> 05:14.582
Oh, no, no, no.
That's not going to work.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.784
We need to buy my lottery
tickets at 9:00.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.519
That's my lucky time.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.921
How is it lucky if
you've never won?

05:20.954 --> 05:24.492
Every time I don't win,
I'm building up my luck.

05:24.525 --> 05:25.859
That's how it works.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.629
Hey, Dad.
What?

05:28.662 --> 05:29.997
Want to chase the crew
around with the forklift?

05:30.030 --> 05:31.665
Is a duck's ass watertight?

05:33.434 --> 05:35.369
ADAM:
Listen, Don.

05:35.403 --> 05:37.871
You have got to take Dad
off my hands.

05:37.905 --> 05:38.972
No way, he wanders off.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.574
I lost him in Target once.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.109
I had to use that red phone
and everything.

05:42.142 --> 05:45.746
I love father and son time.

05:45.779 --> 05:49.550
Once a year, my father and I
go hunting for Bigfoot.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.018
I take what I can get.

05:52.686 --> 05:53.954
Just tell Dad
you have stuff to do

05:53.987 --> 05:55.589
and he needs
to entertain himself.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.625
I can't do that
to the old guy.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.059
I'll just suck it up.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.694
How bad can it be?

06:04.432 --> 06:05.766
What are these guys doing?

06:05.799 --> 06:07.034
The light's green.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.636
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

06:08.669 --> 06:09.903
What are you doing?

06:09.937 --> 06:11.505
You can't honk
another man's horn.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.474
Yes, I can,
I'm grandfathered in.

06:13.507 --> 06:16.444
Hey.

06:16.477 --> 06:19.112
There's four guys
in that truck.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.615
And now they're getting out.
Great.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.651
That's why you don't
put your seat belt on.

06:23.684 --> 06:26.787
It's go time!
Hey!

06:26.820 --> 06:28.622
You are 75 years old.

06:28.656 --> 06:29.857
Go time is over.

06:33.661 --> 06:36.997
Here's your "middle of
the day" Dr. Pepper.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.632
Sorry it took so long,

06:38.666 --> 06:40.133
they were doing roadwork
down by the airport.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.437
Nice try.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.706
This is from the Shell
station down the street.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.942
How are you so good at this?

06:50.744 --> 06:52.813
What's this?

06:52.846 --> 06:55.182
Cream for my dry skin.

06:55.215 --> 06:56.817
Why are you giving it to me?

06:56.850 --> 06:58.819
You have to rub it on me.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.621
What?

07:00.654 --> 07:03.423
Not everywhere, just
the places I can't reach.

07:07.761 --> 07:08.862
Hey, honey.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.798
How was your day?

07:11.832 --> 07:14.835
My dad has a cream, Andi.

07:16.970 --> 07:20.007
That I have to apply.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.709
Oh, boy.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.611
I'm sorry, honey.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.713
Eesh.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.214
Well, you know,
if it helps,

07:27.247 --> 07:30.250
your mom is having a blast
at the hospital.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.653
Well, I can't do another day.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.722
Okay, I-I think
you're overreacting.

07:34.755 --> 07:35.956
Oh, really

07:35.989 --> 07:38.225
Am I

07:38.258 --> 07:42.162
I am more and more confident
the answer is yes.

07:45.799 --> 07:46.834
Let me show you something.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.137
Ooh.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.605
What's in that cream?

07:51.639 --> 07:52.973
Your hands are so soft.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.610
Bong bong bong bong.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.045
I'm hearing it in my sleep now.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.247
Oho, and this is the best part.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.685
Look, Andi,
it's my dad.

08:06.754 --> 08:08.989
In our bed.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.223
Where's Bev?

08:10.257 --> 08:12.025
She volunteered to stay
for the late shift.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.628
Okay. What's for dinner?

08:16.764 --> 08:17.731
Pizza.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.867
I... I was thinking meatloaf.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.034
ANDI:
Okay, well,

08:21.068 --> 08:23.871
um, meatloaf
takes a while, Joe.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.006
Well, I got a good
run of game shows here,

08:26.039 --> 08:27.875
I don't mind waiting.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.880
Adam...
get him out of there.

08:35.949 --> 08:39.219
You need to wrangle
your filly, boy.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.824
I don't think she's the problem.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.759
It's not my fault.

08:45.793 --> 08:48.095
Your mother changed the plan.
What plan?

08:48.128 --> 08:49.897
For our golden years.

08:49.930 --> 08:50.931
We were happy

08:50.964 --> 08:52.265
just staying at home,

08:52.299 --> 08:53.867
watching the world go by.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.069
Then she started
acting different.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.672
Did you make her
rub that cream on you?

09:00.073 --> 09:02.976
'Cause it's making me
act different.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.313
I knew something
was coming.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.682
Every morning,
we'd go out for our walk

09:08.716 --> 09:10.784
and we'd get to the sidewalk
and we'd turn left.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.019
Then one day

09:12.052 --> 09:14.021
last month, she turned right.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.323
Why?
What was she looking for?

09:16.356 --> 09:19.359
And then the Bingo,
and then the hospital.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.362
And here I am.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.297
Well, did you talk to Mom
about any of this?

09:24.331 --> 09:26.166
I don't have to talk
about my feelings.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.835
I'm grandfathered into that.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.339
Where you going?

09:32.372 --> 09:34.374
I have to make a meatloaf.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.844
Well, before you go,

09:36.877 --> 09:38.145
would you get me
another pillow?

09:38.178 --> 09:40.313
I-I need one
for between my legs.

09:42.015 --> 09:44.084
Use Andi's.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.988
I can't believe we're actually
making this meatloaf.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.025
Well, we have to,
he's grandfathered in.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.763
You should have heard
him up there, Andi.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.665
He's... lost.

09:57.698 --> 09:58.866
Well, I don't get it.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.300
Bev's gone away before.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.702
She went on that cruise.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.704
Yeah, but he knew everything

10:03.737 --> 10:05.372
would go back to normal
in a day or two.

10:05.405 --> 10:08.141
This is different.
It's a big change for him.

10:08.175 --> 10:11.879
So, what, Bev has to sit on the
couch for the rest of her life

10:11.912 --> 10:13.080
just to make
her husband happy?

10:13.113 --> 10:14.915
Yes.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.851
Wha...

10:17.885 --> 10:19.086
It's in the vows.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.992
We whisper it
so you don't hear it.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.962
You have to tell my mom
to quit the hospital.
Wha...?

10:28.996 --> 10:30.230
I'm not gonna do that.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.699
She's happy.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.266
So I have to talk
to her all by myself?

10:33.300 --> 10:34.267
Yes.

10:35.903 --> 10:38.906
Wives don't help their
husbands with bad ideas.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.107
It's in the vows.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.744
Well...

10:43.777 --> 10:45.212
I think it's a good idea.

10:45.245 --> 10:49.382
I'll just explain that my dad
is lonely with her gone

10:49.416 --> 10:51.051
and she needs to come back.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.821
I wouldn't get involved
if I were you.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.222
I'm already involved.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.024
My pillow smells like Brylcreem.

10:58.792 --> 11:01.461
It's like sleeping
in Ronald Reagan's arms.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.331
Well, fine, you
can use my pillow.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.733
Uh, no, thank you.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.002
I think we're gonna
have to take

11:09.036 --> 11:10.170
your pillow out back
and shoot it.

11:18.478 --> 11:19.512
Okay, here comes Mom.

11:19.546 --> 11:22.182
I'm going to talk to her
about quitting the hospital.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.284
Well, then
I'm getting out of here.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.853
Oh, your dad's up there.

11:25.886 --> 11:26.854
Oh, here comes your mom.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.355
I... I c...

11:28.388 --> 11:29.790
Pantry!

11:32.459 --> 11:34.127
Oh. Hey, sweetie.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.763
Hey, how was your day
at the hospital?

11:35.796 --> 11:36.964
Tiring, I'll bet, huh?

11:36.997 --> 11:38.732
Makes you want to say,
"Whew,

11:38.766 --> 11:41.068
I am never going
back there again."

11:41.101 --> 11:42.870
Well, lesson learned.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.471
You gave it a shot. Yeah?

11:44.504 --> 11:46.774
Actually, you know,
I feel great.

11:46.807 --> 11:47.775
Helping people gives me
more energy.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.142
More energy?

11:49.176 --> 11:51.378
Ooh... I hear
that's what happens

11:51.411 --> 11:54.081
right before you
should quit a job.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.083
What are we talking about?

11:56.116 --> 11:58.752
Hey, speaking of Dad...
Were we speaking of Dad?

11:58.786 --> 12:00.788
We could talk about Dad
if you want to, yeah, sure.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.155
You know, I...

12:02.189 --> 12:04.758
I think you threw
him a curve ball

12:04.792 --> 12:06.126
by being out of
the house so much.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.494
He misses you.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.863
Oh, that's what
this is about.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.364
You know, honey,

12:11.398 --> 12:13.967
I've been adapting to him
my whole life.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.904
Now I'd like it
if he could adapt to me.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.372
Well, I'd like it if he could
apply his own damn cream,

12:19.406 --> 12:20.808
but that's not happening.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.478
I think what
he really misses

12:25.512 --> 12:27.080
is me cooking and
cleaning for him.

12:27.114 --> 12:32.352
O... Okay, that's a slightly
negative spin on it.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.221
I'm just saying I
think he'd be happier

12:34.254 --> 12:36.023
if you weren't gone
so much, you know?

12:36.056 --> 12:40.393
And if you think about it,
it's kind of romantic. Huh?

12:40.427 --> 12:42.529
Yeah. So he'd be happier

12:42.562 --> 12:45.365
if I weren't doing the thing
that makes me happy.

12:45.398 --> 12:48.535
Again, slightly negative spin.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.871
Mmm!

12:50.904 --> 12:51.939
I smell meatloaf.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.074
Of course you do,
you selfish bastard.

12:56.476 --> 12:59.379
What did you do, boy?

12:59.412 --> 13:01.381
I just told her
that you missed her.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.483
What, are you writing
some kind of romance novel?

13:04.985 --> 13:06.954
I guess I'll be
spending the night.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.188
Wh... Where you going?

13:08.221 --> 13:09.456
Where do you think?

13:09.489 --> 13:11.992
Well, hey, you know,
uh, we have a guest room.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.460
I made you.

13:13.493 --> 13:14.995
You're my guest.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.335
That went well.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.840
Where's the meatloaf?

13:26.874 --> 13:29.509
He took it upstairs,
like a groom takes his bride.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.048
ANDI:
Hey...

13:35.082 --> 13:36.884
you elbowed me in the nose.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.052
I didn't move,
you nosed me in the elbow.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.320
Ugh.

13:41.989 --> 13:45.225
You are breathing
directly into me.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.930
My air is your exhaust.

13:49.963 --> 13:50.998
All right.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.370
I want my bed back.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.605
Look, don't worry.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.207
Dad won't be here long.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.409
Mom will come around.
Wh...

14:02.442 --> 14:04.912
Why are you taking his
side in this whole deal?

14:04.945 --> 14:06.880
He's been driving
you crazy all week.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.449
Well, the man has worked hard
his whole life.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.451
He deserves to retire
on the couch

14:11.484 --> 14:12.886
with his wife
sitting next to him

14:12.920 --> 14:14.321
and cooking him food.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.623
Like any man would want.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.261
Like any man?
Mm.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.030
Not you though, right?

14:28.135 --> 14:29.302
What was the question?

14:31.704 --> 14:35.675
I just want to know how you're
picturing our golden years.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.678
Well, I've worked hard
my whole life, too.

14:38.711 --> 14:42.649
So your plan is to
just sit and eat?

14:43.951 --> 14:45.118
You think you're
making it sound bad,

14:45.152 --> 14:47.254
but you're kind of
selling it.

14:47.287 --> 14:50.590
Okay, well,
that's not healthy.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.492
I mean, you might get fat.

14:52.525 --> 14:55.662
Hey, till death, baby.

14:55.695 --> 14:59.967
But I wanted to do
something fun, together.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.904
You know, like open
Pittsburgh's first winery.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.608
You just like wine.

15:08.641 --> 15:11.178
Yeah, well, I'm
going to need it

15:11.211 --> 15:14.014
if I'm stuck on the couch
with a supersized shut-in.

15:22.222 --> 15:26.159
I am going to breathe
on you so hard tonight.

15:46.013 --> 15:49.716
Adam, we need to talk.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.119
You put the chicken
too far away.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.755
I'm leaving you.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.457
For who?

16:00.593 --> 16:02.129
For me.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.766
Are you leaving me
for my own brother?

16:06.799 --> 16:09.102
Yeah, well,
I had no choice.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.204
He kept it tight.
Mmm.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.239
You know it, mama.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.043
Come back, don't go.

16:16.076 --> 16:19.512
Andi. Andi!

16:19.546 --> 16:21.681
Andi...

16:23.683 --> 16:25.552
Chicken.

16:25.585 --> 16:28.055
Chicken!

16:32.192 --> 16:33.593
What's for breakfast?

16:35.195 --> 16:36.229
Cereal.

16:38.165 --> 16:41.434
I left a note on the fridge
saying I wanted frittatas.

16:41.468 --> 16:45.072
Well, those days
are behind you.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.540
We need to talk about what's
been going on around here.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.342
I told you what's going on.

16:49.376 --> 16:52.345
I went left,
your mom went right.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.747
Get ready to for
two Christmases.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.749
Look...

16:56.783 --> 16:59.219
Okay, listen,
you are going to have to accept

16:59.252 --> 17:02.189
what's happening with Mom
and, you know, adapt.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.091
But I'm grandfathered in.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.525
That's not a thing!

17:05.558 --> 17:07.827
Look...

17:07.860 --> 17:10.463
retirement is a team sport.

17:10.497 --> 17:13.200
You had everything
the way you wanted.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.667
Now Mom has found something
that makes her happy.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.136
Isn't that good?

17:16.169 --> 17:17.837
You think I don't want
to make her happy?

17:17.870 --> 17:20.307
I love her, I... I...

17:20.340 --> 17:22.475
I just, I don't know how
to do any of that stuff.

17:22.509 --> 17:23.776
What stuff?

17:23.810 --> 17:25.078
Home stuff.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.547
My mother fed me,

17:27.580 --> 17:29.316
then the army fed me

17:29.349 --> 17:30.817
and then Bev fed me.

17:32.352 --> 17:35.188
If anything,
this is their fault.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.726
Okay. You want a frittata?

17:40.527 --> 17:41.728
Let's teach you

17:41.761 --> 17:43.363
how to make a frittata.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.166
Then you can
make one for Mom.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.667
You think that would
make her happy?

17:47.700 --> 17:49.336
I do.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.104
Okay, let's do it.

17:52.705 --> 17:55.508
All right.

17:55.542 --> 17:56.709
You want an apron?

17:56.743 --> 17:58.245
I'm willing to try this,

17:58.278 --> 18:00.413
but I'm not putting on
a damn cooking costume.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.724
I still don't understand why
you brought me back here.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.861
Adam called me and he said that
there is a surprise for you.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.799
Joe?

18:20.533 --> 18:21.801
What's this?

18:21.834 --> 18:24.437
I made dinner.

18:26.173 --> 18:29.476
What with you being at
the hospital, I want to, um...

18:29.509 --> 18:31.211
What did you tell me
I wanted to do?

18:32.712 --> 18:35.448
Adapt.

18:35.482 --> 18:38.285
Yeah, that.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.652
You cooked for me?

18:39.686 --> 18:41.854
Well...
You've never done that before.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.691
Retirement is a team sport.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.261
I taught him that.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.864
And I taught you that.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.435
I just want you to know that

18:55.468 --> 18:57.270
I support you.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.839
This is really something, Joe.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.841
Here. See?
Oh!

19:01.874 --> 19:04.244
Ooh, you made
scrambled eggs.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.912
Yeah.

19:07.314 --> 19:09.716
Frittatas are a real
son of a bitch.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.690
By the way, we need to
figure out something else

19:17.724 --> 19:19.726
for our retirement
besides my couch thing.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.663
That doesn't end well.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.300
Oh, well...

19:27.334 --> 19:28.368
I have some ideas.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.237
Hey, if it makes you happy,

19:30.270 --> 19:31.704
it makes me happy.
Aw.

19:31.738 --> 19:34.307
Well, you know
I've always loved dogs,

19:34.341 --> 19:36.643
so how about
running a dog rescue?

19:36.676 --> 19:38.311
I already have a name:

19:38.345 --> 19:40.480
It's The Leash You Can Do.

19:40.513 --> 19:44.317
Ooh, that's good.

19:44.351 --> 19:45.952
Make him do that.

19:45.985 --> 19:48.221
No. No dogs.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.257
Nothing that poops.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.925
Once the three poopers we got
go to college, we're done.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.662
All right.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.464
What else you got?

19:57.497 --> 19:58.465
Okay.

19:58.498 --> 20:01.834
How about...

20:01.868 --> 20:06.439
we open a mask store?

20:09.976 --> 20:11.744
A what?

20:11.778 --> 20:13.980
A store that sells nothing

20:14.013 --> 20:16.283
but masks from
around the world.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.617
Ooh, that's a winner.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.952
Yeah.
Yeah.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.988
And we will call it...

20:22.021 --> 20:23.656
Maskwell House.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.763
It feels like you're just
coming up with a funny name

20:30.797 --> 20:32.832
and then working
backwards from there.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.570
Yeah! That's my process.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.005
Hmm.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.840
It's cute, right?

20:44.344 --> 20:45.478
Hey, guys.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.680
You get the hell away
from my wife.
