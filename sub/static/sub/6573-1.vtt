00:06.258 --> 00:07.308
It was May...

00:08.522 --> 00:09.898
It was May 4,

00:09.940 --> 00:12.651
and in the bayside town
of Newport Beach,

00:12.693 --> 00:14.111
the annual celebration

00:14.152 --> 00:17.030
known as Cinco de Cuatro
was underway.

00:17.672 --> 00:21.468
The holiday started as
a particularly vicious response

00:21.509 --> 00:24.637
by a young Lucille Bluth
to the Mexican holiday...

00:24.679 --> 00:26.973
- This still isn't made?
- ...of Cinco de Mayo.

00:27.015 --> 00:30.185
- No, no, it's not. 
- Rosa, why is this still a mess?!

00:30.226 --> 00:32.479
She said it's, uh,
it's Cinco de Mayo.

00:32.520 --> 00:33.720
She's taking, uh, the day off.

00:33.946 --> 00:35.489
- She said that?
- Yeah.

00:35.531 --> 00:36.991
- She called it Cinco de Mayo?
- She did, yeah.

00:37.032 --> 00:39.702
Oh, why can't they
just call it May 5?

00:39.743 --> 00:41.120
This is what
I was talking about.

00:41.161 --> 00:42.705
It's all part
of the Mexican war on May 5.

00:42.746 --> 00:44.426
- War on May 5, I know, yeah. It is. 
- It is.

00:44.456 --> 00:46.542
But even a skeptical George Sr.

00:46.584 --> 00:49.003
soon found himself feeling
similarly embattled.

00:49.044 --> 00:50.671
Where the  are my socks?!

00:50.713 --> 00:52.756
Now it's not so funny, is it?

00:52.798 --> 00:54.758
No, not funny.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.677
We should start our own holiday.

00:56.719 --> 00:59.930
You see, the Hispanics
of Newport liked Cinco a lot,

00:59.972 --> 01:03.475
but high up on Coast Highway,
Lucille Bluth did not.

01:03.517 --> 01:06.437
Doesn't look like they'll be
done any time soon.

01:06.478 --> 01:09.064
And then Lucille had
a horrible thought,

01:09.106 --> 01:12.568
a thought that was thoughtless
and better to not.

01:12.610 --> 01:14.987
"What if," she thought
with a sneering grin...

01:15.029 --> 01:19.950
Next year what if the party
didn't even begin?

01:19.992 --> 01:22.870
And so began
a holiday on the eve

01:22.912 --> 01:24.788
- of the fifth of May...
- ♪ The cockroach... ♪

01:24.830 --> 01:27.958
...originally intended
to deplete the party supplies

01:28.000 --> 01:30.544
the Cinco de Mayo celebrants
were relying upon.

01:30.586 --> 01:32.212
Fill the bay with chorizo.

01:32.254 --> 01:34.715
- Chorizo dump!
- Over 30 years, however, it grew

01:34.757 --> 01:37.217
and was soon embraced
by the Hispanic community...

01:37.259 --> 01:38.594
You buy it, you break it!

01:38.636 --> 01:39.637
...for financial reasons...

01:39.678 --> 01:42.431
and as the celebrations peaked

01:42.473 --> 01:46.018
with a boat parade
called the Festival of Lights--

01:46.060 --> 01:47.770
another phrase
they wanted back--

01:47.811 --> 01:51.273
one man was about
to hit his lowest point.

01:54.276 --> 01:56.904
♪ On the sixth of May... ♪

01:56.946 --> 02:00.157
Happy Cuatro, happy Cuatro!

02:00.199 --> 02:01.533
Let's throw
some more taco shells.

02:01.575 --> 02:02.576
Olé!

02:02.618 --> 02:03.953
Sally, can I...?

02:03.994 --> 02:06.747
I need to speak
to Lucille 2, please.

02:06.789 --> 02:09.750
It's okay, Sally,
I'll talk to Michael.

02:09.792 --> 02:11.168
This is Lucille 2,

02:11.210 --> 02:14.213
a longtime patron
of the Bluth family.

02:14.254 --> 02:16.131
I'll be downstairs
kicking myself

02:16.173 --> 02:18.467
for not marrying you
so many years ago.

02:18.509 --> 02:21.220
Michael, do you have
something for me?

02:21.261 --> 02:22.680
Does bad news count?

02:22.721 --> 02:24.056
There's that Bluth wit.

02:24.098 --> 02:25.975
Oh, I love your family.

02:26.016 --> 02:27.559
She certainly
had demonstrated that

02:27.601 --> 02:29.687
with many of the men
in the family...

02:29.728 --> 02:31.772
Oh, stop it,
you're making me dizzy.

02:31.814 --> 02:34.233
...even having fallen
for a few,

02:34.274 --> 02:37.486
although some of that was
the vertigo she suffered from.

02:37.528 --> 02:38.821
But not all of it.

02:38.862 --> 02:41.740
- Dad?
- No, no.

02:41.782 --> 02:44.827
But seriously, she had gotten
intimate with Buster and Gob.

02:44.868 --> 02:45.953
I need that money I lent you.

02:45.995 --> 02:48.038
I am in the middle of a campaign

02:48.080 --> 02:49.915
and I am desperate
for the ad money.

02:49.957 --> 02:51.000
You're going to get it.

02:51.041 --> 02:52.876
I just need an extension.

02:52.918 --> 02:53.961
Why don't you go to your family?

02:54.003 --> 02:55.838
I don't need them.

02:55.879 --> 02:57.214
What I need is you.

02:57.256 --> 02:59.675
What are you suggesting?

03:01.000 --> 03:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:08.516 --> 03:10.644
No.

03:10.686 --> 03:13.897
Okay, that was nasty.

03:13.939 --> 03:15.482
Aren't you sweet?

03:15.523 --> 03:16.859
- Thank you.
- Okay.

03:18.652 --> 03:20.988
Don't tilt your head, okay?

03:21.030 --> 03:23.574
And that's
when Michael debased himself.

03:23.615 --> 03:24.742
What are you doing?

03:24.783 --> 03:27.161
I'm gonna have sex
with you for money.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.083
Later that night,

03:33.125 --> 03:36.128
after Michael did
something unthinkable,

03:36.170 --> 03:38.797
he was looking
for a place to hide

03:38.839 --> 03:41.800
and he returned
to a long neglected model home

03:41.842 --> 03:43.594
he believed to be empty.

03:45.220 --> 03:47.181
Thanks for coming

03:47.222 --> 03:49.308
so late, Maria, I know
that you won't be cleaning up

03:49.349 --> 03:51.727
tomorrow, and we did make
quite a mess of that bedroom.

03:51.769 --> 03:53.562
Michael.

03:53.604 --> 03:55.731
This is Michael's brother Gob.

03:55.773 --> 03:57.524
Neither had expected
to see each other

03:57.566 --> 03:59.651
after some recent
unpleasantness.

03:59.693 --> 04:01.195
I didn't expect
to be seeing you again

04:01.236 --> 04:03.572
after all the unpleasantness.

04:03.614 --> 04:05.282
I-I've, I've,
I've been out of control.

04:05.324 --> 04:06.909
Sorry.

04:06.950 --> 04:08.327
In fact, I-I just did something
that I-I don't,

04:08.368 --> 04:10.329
I don't, I don't know
why I did it.

04:10.370 --> 04:11.705
Do you want to talk about it?

04:11.747 --> 04:13.874
No, I do not,
I've said too much already.

04:13.916 --> 04:15.042
You cannot help me.

04:15.084 --> 04:16.043
Well, I wasn't hoping to help.

04:16.084 --> 04:17.293
I was hoping to rub it in

04:17.336 --> 04:19.171
because of all
the unpleasantness.

04:19.213 --> 04:21.673
- Got it. - Oh, damn it, I meant
to throw these in the chipper.

04:21.714 --> 04:24.259
God, I'm just not
into Cuatro this year.

04:24.301 --> 04:26.136
I was the one that was wrong,
not you,

04:26.178 --> 04:28.222
and besides, you could not
make me feel worse right now.

04:28.263 --> 04:29.598
Well, I'd be willing

04:29.640 --> 04:30.933
to let you have
your apology back

04:30.974 --> 04:32.351
if you give me
the chance to try.

04:32.392 --> 04:33.832
I mean, I'm gonna need
some specifics

04:33.852 --> 04:35.270
about the thing
that you're ashamed of.

04:35.312 --> 04:37.689
Otherwise I'll just be
taking general potshots.

04:39.858 --> 04:43.612
Bad example: if you were ashamed
of being in love with a man,

04:43.654 --> 04:45.864
suddenly discovered
these new feelings,

04:45.906 --> 04:48.367
then I might say something like,
"Homo much?"

04:48.408 --> 04:49.743
- It's not that.
- I said "Bad example."

04:49.785 --> 04:51.161
I went to go see Lucille 2

04:51.203 --> 04:54.623
and I just, I just-- 
I lost control.

04:54.665 --> 04:56.416
I did something
that I wish I could forget.

04:56.458 --> 04:58.252
You have got no idea how I feel.

04:58.293 --> 04:59.962
Well, if you're talking about
doing something embarrassing

05:00.003 --> 05:01.588
with a woman, then no, I don't.

05:01.630 --> 05:03.090
But he should have.

05:03.132 --> 05:04.967
It's almost
as if he found a way

05:05.008 --> 05:08.220
to simulate amnesia.

05:08.262 --> 05:10.305
Hey, I'm down
to my last Forget-Me-Now.

05:10.347 --> 05:12.683
In fact,
that is what he had done.

05:12.724 --> 05:15.352
Hey, remember me?

05:15.394 --> 05:17.104
Gob had always taken a pill

05:17.146 --> 05:19.606
he called a Forget-Me-Now
for that...

05:19.648 --> 05:21.275
- No más.
- ¿No más?

05:21.316 --> 05:22.734
...but was commonly known
as a roofie.

05:22.776 --> 05:23.735
There's only one left.

05:23.777 --> 05:25.237
How could that possibly be?

05:25.279 --> 05:26.280
Unless... John Beard Jr.

05:26.321 --> 05:27.990
I don't need to get into it.

05:28.031 --> 05:29.783
I came here because I thought
the house was empty,

05:29.825 --> 05:31.659
but I can go
somewhere else, okay?

05:31.702 --> 05:34.288
- Hey, listen, Michael, if you
want, we can split this. - No,

05:34.329 --> 05:36.206
I feel like this is something
that I shouldn't forget,

05:36.248 --> 05:38.083
okay, and believe me,
this is the last time

05:38.125 --> 05:40.210
I ever judge you for anything

05:40.252 --> 05:41.211
that you ever do.

05:41.253 --> 05:43.046
Oh,.

05:44.089 --> 05:45.424
Is that who you were with?

05:45.465 --> 05:47.301
I knew it, I always knew it.

05:47.342 --> 05:48.927
- Take this, Michael, forget, forget. 
- No, no, no, no, no.

05:48.969 --> 05:50.262
Put the mask back on.
Forget this, Michael.

05:50.304 --> 05:52.431
- Forget, forget, Michael.
- Gob.

05:52.472 --> 05:53.891
Forget, now is the time
to forget.

05:53.932 --> 05:55.142
Now you're forgetting.

05:55.184 --> 05:57.853
- Now you're forgetting.
- God.

05:57.895 --> 05:59.396
♪ It's so easy to forget... ♪

06:00.814 --> 06:03.775
♪ It's so easy to forget. ♪

06:03.817 --> 06:06.403
Stupid, forgetful Michael.

06:06.445 --> 06:08.363
Now, the story of a family

06:08.405 --> 06:12.117
whose future was abruptly
canceled and the one son

06:12.159 --> 06:14.203
who had no choice
but to keep himself together.

06:19.707 --> 06:21.335
It's Michael's...

06:23.711 --> 06:26.965
Six months
before the Forget-Me-Now,

06:27.007 --> 06:29.009
Michael had made good
on a long-standing threat

06:29.051 --> 06:30.802
to go to Phoenix,

06:30.844 --> 06:34.932
and even though the Phoenix
he went to was online,

06:34.973 --> 06:37.768
he still enjoyed
the full college experience

06:37.809 --> 06:40.728
by living in a dorm room
while doing so.

06:40.771 --> 06:43.232
George Michael, what is
my log-on password again?

06:43.273 --> 06:45.317
Unfortunately
it was his son's dorm room

06:45.359 --> 06:47.110
at the University of California
at Irvine.

06:47.152 --> 06:51.782
Dad, come on, what have we said
is the most important thing?

06:51.823 --> 06:53.283
I have tried "family."

06:53.325 --> 06:54.868
- It does not work for me.
- No, privacy.

06:54.910 --> 06:57.120
This is Michael's son

06:57.162 --> 06:59.831
George Michael-- a nice kid.

06:59.873 --> 07:02.292
Uh, no one should have
your password but you.

07:02.334 --> 07:03.835
I shouldn't even know it.

07:03.877 --> 07:05.754
- You've made that point.
- Have I?

07:05.796 --> 07:07.881
My point is, we have
no secrets from each other.

07:07.923 --> 07:10.384
We know everything there is
to know about each other.

07:10.425 --> 07:11.385
We're like twins.

07:11.426 --> 07:13.387
I don't see us as twins.

07:13.428 --> 07:16.265
Yeah? You name me one way
in which we're different.

07:16.306 --> 07:18.183
I think you tend to be better

07:18.225 --> 07:21.478
at feeling
like you belong places.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.522
Do I?

07:25.857 --> 07:29.027
I want you to start feeling
like you belong places.

07:29.069 --> 07:30.153
Look at that guy.

07:30.195 --> 07:32.364
He thinks he's a musician.

07:32.406 --> 07:34.046
You know, like,
you've got to start having

07:34.074 --> 07:36.326
a little bit better sense
of humor about yourself.

07:36.368 --> 07:37.327
Look at me.

07:37.369 --> 07:38.537
People say I don't age.

07:38.578 --> 07:40.122
You know, like,
"Hey, look at that guy.

07:40.163 --> 07:41.915
He's got the hair
of a teenager."

07:41.957 --> 07:44.293
And I say, "Take your best shot"

07:44.334 --> 07:46.169
because I think
that that's a good thing

07:46.211 --> 07:47.879
because I'm self-effacing.

07:47.921 --> 07:49.131
Hmm?

07:49.172 --> 07:50.549
I want you to be able
to do that.

07:50.590 --> 07:52.384
Well, it's hard
to be self-effacing

07:52.426 --> 07:56.096
when you're a perfect specimen
of rugged manlessness.

07:58.390 --> 08:00.142
Well, you can't hear this, but,

08:00.183 --> 08:01.727
but we're gonna work on it.

08:01.768 --> 08:03.395
That's why I'm living
in your dorm.

08:03.437 --> 08:04.837
Well, I thought
you were living here

08:04.855 --> 08:06.440
because you had
nowhere else to go.

08:06.481 --> 08:08.900
Yeah, and because of the fact
you had this big double room

08:08.942 --> 08:10.152
all to yourself
because of your name.

08:10.193 --> 08:11.987
The name George Michael

08:12.029 --> 08:14.781
did create confusion
in the campus housing office.

08:14.823 --> 08:16.283
This guy's name is actually
George Michael.

08:16.325 --> 08:17.451
No, it's two different guys.

08:17.492 --> 08:20.245
They're twins, ugly.

08:20.287 --> 08:22.205
We should sign them up
for Twin Club.

08:22.247 --> 08:25.292
And let's give them
the big handicap room.

08:25.334 --> 08:26.960
Yeah, you see,
that's the other thing, is that

08:27.002 --> 08:29.087
I kind of wanted to use
this time to almost kind of,

08:29.129 --> 08:31.798
you know, wean off
of the name George Michael.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.426
What?

08:34.467 --> 08:37.179
I don't know, you know,
you get older, you do

08:37.220 --> 08:39.514
a something search
of your own name...

08:39.556 --> 08:41.433
In George Michael's
case, you find this.

08:41.475 --> 08:44.478
It was in this men's room in-- 
get this-- Beverly Hills

08:44.519 --> 08:46.897
that singer George Michael
was arrested

08:46.938 --> 08:50.025
for soliciting sex
from an undercover cop.

08:50.067 --> 08:53.028
Well, it was your mother's idea
to call you George Michael,

08:53.070 --> 08:54.196
you know, and I think
it was just

08:54.237 --> 08:55.864
so that we didn't confuse you

08:55.906 --> 08:58.116
with your Uncle George or
your Grandfather George.

08:58.158 --> 09:00.786
- Right. 
- I got it, let's call you Boy George.

09:00.827 --> 09:01.787
Singer Boy George

09:01.828 --> 09:02.788
in the news again today,

09:02.829 --> 09:03.872
this time for sexual assault

09:03.914 --> 09:05.874
in a men's public bathroom.

09:05.916 --> 09:07.125
Beatrix Hebberly-Sneed,
Wee BBC 2.

09:07.167 --> 09:08.960
You know, I think

09:09.002 --> 09:11.129
I'll, I'll just-- 
I'll stick with George Michael.

09:11.171 --> 09:12.964
I mean, at least
it was consensual.

09:13.006 --> 09:15.133
But I guess the, uh,
the bigger point

09:15.175 --> 09:17.344
I'm making is just that,
uh, it's hard to have

09:17.386 --> 09:19.179
any privacy
now that they've stuck me

09:19.221 --> 09:21.431
- with an actual roommate.
- Well, you know, listen,

09:21.473 --> 09:23.850
I'm all for kicking P-Hound out,
you know that.

09:23.892 --> 09:26.061
Well, you know, I didn't
really mean privacy from him.

09:26.103 --> 09:28.105
I know, I know, I know.

09:30.941 --> 09:32.901
You want your space from me?

09:32.943 --> 09:34.403
Um, look,

09:34.444 --> 09:38.198
listen, hey, hey,
look, look, listen.

09:38.240 --> 09:40.325
Listen, look it.

09:40.367 --> 09:43.161
Are you listening?
You want your space.

09:43.203 --> 09:44.454
I get it.

09:44.496 --> 09:47.916
I did not mean
to crowd you, pal.

09:47.958 --> 09:50.961
Listen, I thought that this was,
that this was fun, and,

09:51.002 --> 09:53.088
- and it is okay if you didn't
see it that way. - Oh, Dad.

09:53.130 --> 09:55.132
Buddy, it's not like
I don't have someplace to go.

09:55.173 --> 09:57.300
You know, I'll just go
right back to the model home.

09:57.342 --> 09:59.094
They don't have Internet there,
so I'll just put

09:59.136 --> 10:00.971
the law school on, on, on pause.

10:01.012 --> 10:02.597
It's not like the first time
that I've done that.

10:02.639 --> 10:04.641
You know, last time I did that,
you were born. You know what?

10:04.683 --> 10:06.309
Screw it, maybe I'll just go
to the real Phoenix

10:06.351 --> 10:07.936
and finish school.

10:07.978 --> 10:09.229
They got one in Costa Mesa.

10:09.271 --> 10:11.022
Plus they want me
for an article.

10:11.064 --> 10:12.399
Media wants to talk
to Daddy about the real

10:12.441 --> 10:13.984
estate business,
and once they do that,

10:14.025 --> 10:15.694
I'm gonna be right back on top.

10:15.735 --> 10:17.195
You know what?
This is your school rally shirt.

10:17.237 --> 10:19.072
You know, same size--medium.

10:19.114 --> 10:21.032
Do you know where mine is? We
wear the same size like twi...

10:21.074 --> 10:23.410
We're just like twin-- 
couple of identical...

10:23.452 --> 10:25.120
Dad, Dad, no, I...

10:25.162 --> 10:28.623
Look, I was not talking
about privacy from you per se.

10:28.665 --> 10:33.128
I was talking about my software.

10:33.170 --> 10:34.588
What's that?

10:34.629 --> 10:37.215
It's privacy software.

10:37.257 --> 10:38.633
That's why the word came up.

10:38.675 --> 10:40.385
It's not why the word came up.

10:40.427 --> 10:42.345
But George Michael
was writing code

10:42.387 --> 10:44.181
for a block software

10:44.222 --> 10:46.683
with his roommate
that was proving challenging.

10:46.725 --> 10:48.143
...you're leaving a hole

10:48.185 --> 10:49.728
just right in the middle
of the block.

10:49.769 --> 10:52.063
Both because of online threats
to his privacy...

10:52.105 --> 10:54.025
Otherwise, people will be
able to hack in through

10:54.065 --> 10:56.151
a mobile platform portal, and
it won't be a block anything 3G.

10:56.193 --> 10:58.361
...and some in-room threats
to his privacy, as well.

10:58.403 --> 11:00.322
Buddy, is that schoolwork?

11:00.363 --> 11:01.656
No, we're just right
in the middle of this software.

11:01.698 --> 11:03.450
Great, good.
Give me the lappy.

11:03.492 --> 11:05.285
I'll hit save for you.
I got to Skype with my advisor

11:05.327 --> 11:07.162
in Phoenix, and if I don't
get on right now,

11:07.204 --> 11:11.500
he's gonna have to Skype me
from a T.G.I. Friday's.

11:11.541 --> 11:13.502
- Oh.
- Yeah.

11:13.543 --> 11:15.045
Whew.

11:15.086 --> 11:16.379
'Cause that hurt for a second.

11:16.421 --> 11:18.048
I was like, he wants me to go.

11:18.089 --> 11:20.091
- No, no, no, no, no.
- But no. Yeah? No.

11:20.133 --> 11:21.259
- Software.
- No.

11:21.301 --> 11:22.469
I mean, yeah, I may need

11:22.511 --> 11:24.596
some privacy, you know,
to work on it,

11:24.638 --> 11:29.226
and that might mean...
you going.

11:32.103 --> 11:33.688
Oh, you mean here.

11:33.730 --> 11:35.357
Yeah, clearing out.

11:35.398 --> 11:37.067
An hour, here, there. Yes?

11:37.108 --> 11:38.401
Got it. Not a problem.
You give me a little

11:38.443 --> 11:40.445
fair warning,
I clear right out of here.

11:40.487 --> 11:42.239
Let's schedule it now.
We can do it.

11:42.280 --> 11:43.740
I need help with
the calendar though.

11:43.782 --> 11:46.368
It's, like, stuck on 2003.

11:46.409 --> 11:48.369
- Help me just break into...
- You just hit "today."

11:48.370 --> 11:50.080
- The "today" button.
- Sorry. It's stuck in 2003,

11:50.121 --> 11:51.248
so I don't have "today."

11:51.289 --> 11:52.290
I need to jump forward...

11:52.332 --> 11:53.750
No, I know, there's a button

11:53.792 --> 11:55.460
- that says "today."
- Yeah, this has no button.

11:55.502 --> 11:56.628
Anyway, you know,
I'm just gonna run downstairs

11:56.670 --> 11:57.546
and, uh, grab a bite.

11:57.587 --> 11:59.714
Wait, I want to go.

12:01.258 --> 12:02.551
Let me go. I'll go. I'm hungry.

12:02.592 --> 12:04.553
Come on.

12:06.053 --> 12:08.473
Michael Bluth
was fitting right in

12:08.515 --> 12:10.141
with his son's
college experience.

12:10.183 --> 12:11.768
Be good for you, huh?

12:11.810 --> 12:13.853
Gettable, right?

12:13.895 --> 12:15.522
Hey, tell me about
the software thing.

12:15.564 --> 12:17.107
This is the Faceblock thing
you were working on?

12:17.148 --> 12:18.108
Is it like Facebook?

12:18.149 --> 12:19.859
Uh, well, no.

12:19.901 --> 12:21.486
It's kind of the opposite
of Facebook, you know.

12:21.528 --> 12:23.488
Facebook connects you
with everyone,

12:23.530 --> 12:25.657
this blocks you from everyone.

12:25.699 --> 12:28.034
Oh, okay. Kind of like
the antisocial network, right?

12:28.075 --> 12:29.703
- That's very good.
- You can use it.

12:29.744 --> 12:31.246
I don't understand
the Internet stuff.

12:31.288 --> 12:33.665
You give me all the parts
and you tell me to build

12:33.707 --> 12:35.917
a television set, I can
bang that out, but I, you know,

12:35.959 --> 12:37.999
I can't get the right day
to display on my calendar.

12:38.003 --> 12:39.963
- Just press "today."
- Yeah, just tried that.

12:40.005 --> 12:41.756
Doesn't work on mine, pal.

12:41.798 --> 12:43.675
This is very, very, very
exciting, you know,

12:43.717 --> 12:46.761
because once they come out
with that article on me

12:46.803 --> 12:48.680
in that in-flight magazine,

12:48.722 --> 12:50.890
now, the family's gonna be
right back on top.

12:50.932 --> 12:53.100
- The guy's doing a whole spread on me. 
- In-flight magazine?

12:53.143 --> 12:54.686
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
It's called Altitude.

12:54.728 --> 12:55.895
It's for OutWest Airlines.

12:55.937 --> 12:57.063
Next to SkyMall, it's, like,

12:57.104 --> 12:58.732
the number two most read
in all of coach.

12:58.773 --> 13:00.191
Well, three with
the safety card,

13:00.233 --> 13:02.902
but get a lot of attention
for Sudden Valley.

13:02.944 --> 13:04.946
And then with your Internet
company, it's gonna be like--

13:04.988 --> 13:06.948
we're gonna have two businesses,
you know?

13:06.990 --> 13:08.658
And yours sounds like
such a natural.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.785
I mean, no one likes
to share their identity.

13:10.827 --> 13:11.995
- Right?
- Well...

13:12.037 --> 13:13.120
Okay, give me
your meal plan card.

13:13.163 --> 13:14.748
I'm gonna run in there,

13:14.789 --> 13:16.041
I'm gonna grab a tray,
you run around back,

13:16.082 --> 13:17.042
make sure you get there in time,

13:17.083 --> 13:18.168
before my hand stamp dries.

13:18.209 --> 13:19.169
Okay?

13:19.210 --> 13:21.128
Here we go.

13:21.171 --> 13:23.173
Michael had a right
to be excited.

13:23.214 --> 13:25.592
It had been many years
since the Bluth family

13:25.634 --> 13:27.552
had had any business success.

13:27.594 --> 13:31.806
Not since Michael's mother
Lucille had sold off a quarter

13:31.848 --> 13:35.018
of the company just before the
onset of the great dark period.

13:35.060 --> 13:37.270
But after examining
the company's prospects...

13:37.312 --> 13:40.147
Are those police boats?

13:40.190 --> 13:41.900
Lucille 2.

13:41.941 --> 13:43.568
...Stan Sitwell
quickly divested himself.

13:43.610 --> 13:46.196
How'd you like to be bumped up
to Lucille 1?

13:46.237 --> 13:48.155
So the Bluth family
had a new stakeholder,

13:48.198 --> 13:50.992
while the old one,
who knew she'd be implicated

13:51.034 --> 13:52.786
in some of
the family's misdeeds...

13:52.827 --> 13:54.746
You boys know
how to shovel coal?

13:54.788 --> 13:57.624
...headed out on whatever the
opposite of a maiden voyage is.

13:58.750 --> 14:01.086
Michael, however, made a pledge

14:01.127 --> 14:03.797
not to get pulled
into the drama

14:03.838 --> 14:06.925
and to let the family
keep themselves all together,

14:06.966 --> 14:08.677
- for a while.
- ...for a while.

14:08.718 --> 14:10.679
And he set off to sea, even as

14:10.720 --> 14:13.056
his mother mysteriously
turned back.

14:13.098 --> 14:15.934
Why the alleged ship-jacker
changed direction

14:15.975 --> 14:17.560
is still unexplained.

14:17.602 --> 14:19.979
But what is known
is that many of the charges

14:20.021 --> 14:22.607
against this seaward matriarch
will fall under

14:22.649 --> 14:26.236
the dominion of the little
understood maritime law.

14:26.277 --> 14:28.613
And soon,
the hearing drew near...

14:28.655 --> 14:30.073
Well, I missed the hearing.

14:30.115 --> 14:31.783
...and then passed.

14:31.825 --> 14:33.660
Oh, it just snuck up on me,
and then they called,

14:33.702 --> 14:35.370
and they wanted me there
at eight bells.

14:35.412 --> 14:37.914
You know, I thought
that was their 5:00 p.m.

14:37.956 --> 14:40.041
By the time I got back,
the courtroom was

14:40.083 --> 14:42.001
reverted back
to the crab restaurant.

14:42.043 --> 14:43.670
"Eight bells" refers
to a watch length.

14:43.712 --> 14:45.004
It's maritime law.

14:45.046 --> 14:47.090
Yes, Michael returned
after all.

14:47.132 --> 14:49.050
You know, one bell is struck
after 30 minutes, two bells...

14:49.092 --> 14:50.385
It seems Michael
had been interested

14:50.427 --> 14:53.138
in maritime law
since playing a lawyer

14:53.179 --> 14:55.056
in an original school play

14:55.098 --> 14:57.684
titled The Trial
of Captain Hook.

14:57.726 --> 14:59.269
♪ You're a crook,
Captain Hook... ♪

14:59.310 --> 15:01.104
Prior to this,
his only dream had been

15:01.146 --> 15:02.605
to possess the power of flight.

15:02.647 --> 15:05.066
But that one turned out to be

15:05.108 --> 15:06.609
not as much fun as he thought.

15:06.651 --> 15:08.862
Watch out for the seal!

15:09.904 --> 15:11.698
Loose seal! Loose seal!

15:11.740 --> 15:13.658
I'm watching!

15:16.244 --> 15:18.079
You're out of the play!

15:18.121 --> 15:20.039
That's why, at sea, a watch with
no incidents is described as

15:20.081 --> 15:21.374
"eight bells and all is well."

15:21.416 --> 15:23.877
Wow, maybe you should be
the maritime lawyer.

15:23.918 --> 15:24.961
This is what I've been saying.

15:25.003 --> 15:26.296
Because I did go to law school

15:26.337 --> 15:27.756
with an emphasis
on maritime law.

15:27.797 --> 15:29.758
Oh, your one year of law school

15:29.799 --> 15:31.676
is going to beat Barry's three?

15:31.718 --> 15:33.261
It's ridiculous.

15:33.303 --> 15:34.345
We'll hire the best.

15:34.387 --> 15:35.346
And who's gonna pay

15:35.388 --> 15:36.848
for the best, Mom?

15:36.890 --> 15:38.141
We have money from
selling some shares.

15:38.183 --> 15:40.101
Plus, we got
that stimulus package.

15:40.143 --> 15:41.352
What are you talking about?

15:41.394 --> 15:43.021
That money is spent.

15:43.062 --> 15:46.149
I just bought 4,000 acres
of California desert.

15:46.191 --> 15:47.150
Time-out.

15:47.192 --> 15:48.693
Hang on.

15:48.735 --> 15:50.361
- What's this?
- Yeah.

15:50.403 --> 15:53.406
I'm gonna be moving there
for a little while.

15:53.448 --> 15:56.159
Old big bear's not gonna be
around much anymore.

15:56.201 --> 15:58.161
- I don't care about that.
- He's in denial.

15:58.203 --> 15:59.662
- We're getting divorced!
- Your mother and I

15:59.704 --> 16:00.663
are getting a divorce.

16:05.084 --> 16:06.002
I want to know...

16:11.841 --> 16:13.760
I want to know about
the stimulus package.

16:13.802 --> 16:16.679
You couldn't use any of that
money to finish Sudden Valley?

16:16.721 --> 16:18.348
You don't consider
that finished?

16:19.849 --> 16:21.309
So the family got
a little stimmy.

16:21.351 --> 16:23.144
Don't make a federal case
out of it.

16:23.186 --> 16:25.730
That is exactly what they're
going to make out of it.

16:25.772 --> 16:27.315
And when you say "family,"
you mean our family?

16:27.357 --> 16:28.691
They've already got
their hooks in it?

16:28.733 --> 16:30.026
Buster, no offense.

16:30.068 --> 16:31.027
None taken.

16:31.069 --> 16:32.487
Oh, I keep losing my jewels.

16:32.529 --> 16:34.906
Michael, you never
accept help from anyone.

16:34.948 --> 16:36.991
That's why we didn't cut you in.

16:37.033 --> 16:38.409
We didn't want to demean you.

16:38.451 --> 16:40.829
It's like tipping
an African-American.

16:40.870 --> 16:43.248
You wouldn't tip
an African-American, would you?

16:43.289 --> 16:45.250
Of course I would.

16:45.291 --> 16:47.418
On a train?

16:47.460 --> 16:48.878
What...

16:48.920 --> 16:50.839
Did you know about all this?

16:50.880 --> 16:53.174
No, I've been tipping them.

16:53.216 --> 16:54.509
Even a waiter?

16:54.551 --> 16:56.427
Okay, the treadmill's
up and running.

16:56.469 --> 16:58.721
We got the door on,
and we were able

16:58.763 --> 17:00.932
to match the faux on the paint.

17:05.060 --> 17:07.480
Thank you so much
for your hard work.

17:11.483 --> 17:13.862
So long.

17:15.238 --> 17:17.866
Michael, we can't
give you that money.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.367
We got to keep you clean.

17:19.409 --> 17:21.118
You're the key witness
in your mother's trial.

17:21.160 --> 17:22.244
Let me get this straight.

17:22.287 --> 17:24.122
I still have to do all the work

17:24.163 --> 17:26.958
as the president of the company,
but I can't use any of the money

17:27.000 --> 17:29.210
for the company, and you won't
let me help with your case,

17:29.252 --> 17:31.379
but you'd still like for me
to testify at your trial.

17:31.421 --> 17:32.964
Is that right?

17:33.006 --> 17:35.508
I just want you to say
I was a loving mother.

17:35.550 --> 17:36.885
And now perjury.

17:36.926 --> 17:38.219
Hey, it wasn't easy to get

17:38.261 --> 17:40.555
Lucille 2 to keep you on
as president.

17:40.597 --> 17:43.141
- I'll be sure to thank her.
- Don't thank her.

17:43.182 --> 17:45.310
She doesn't have
enough shares to stop us.

17:45.351 --> 17:47.270
Hmm.

17:47.312 --> 17:49.314
And that's how Michael
found a way

17:49.355 --> 17:50.315
to finish
Sudden Valley himself.

17:50.356 --> 17:52.859
- Hello.
- Hello.

17:52.901 --> 17:57.030
He simply traded his shares of
the Bluth company to Lucille 2.

17:57.071 --> 17:58.740
I hold on to Sudden Valley;
it's like a pet project...

17:58.781 --> 18:00.158
- Getting himself out,
- Thank you so much.

18:00.199 --> 18:02.201
and giving the balance of power

18:02.243 --> 18:05.330
to a woman who had
no power of balance.

18:05.371 --> 18:06.789
Oh.

18:08.499 --> 18:11.836
And for the first time,
he didn't feel he needed

18:11.878 --> 18:15.298
to tell his family
he was done with them.

18:15.340 --> 18:16.841
But he did anyway.

18:16.883 --> 18:19.177
You know what,
I am done with this family.

18:19.218 --> 18:20.803
I hope you've saved some money,

18:20.845 --> 18:22.889
'cause you're gonna need
every dime now.

18:22.931 --> 18:24.140
What's this?

18:24.182 --> 18:26.893
And with his newfound wealth,

18:26.935 --> 18:29.228
Michael was not only able
to send his son off

18:29.270 --> 18:31.397
- Get out of here!
- to a bright future

18:31.439 --> 18:34.025
in college,
with the family car...

18:35.944 --> 18:37.528
...he was also able to finish

18:37.570 --> 18:41.157
the long-delayed housing
development Sudden Valley,

18:41.199 --> 18:46.245
but this time,
under his own company name.

18:46.287 --> 18:47.872
Maybe I can give you a tip.

18:47.914 --> 18:49.499
Might want to put a road
up to this place.

18:49.540 --> 18:51.167
Well, we paved the neighborhood.

18:51.209 --> 18:53.169
Just waiting for the city
to build a road to it.

18:53.211 --> 18:55.380
And although his mother's
day in court was something

18:55.421 --> 18:59.550
both he and his college-bound
son would miss,

18:59.592 --> 19:02.095
Michael truly felt
that nothing could go wrong.

19:02.136 --> 19:04.472
And then something did.

19:06.349 --> 19:08.476
Not that.
That happens all the time.

19:08.518 --> 19:10.061
This.

19:10.103 --> 19:12.522
The collapse of the California
housing market

19:12.563 --> 19:15.984
is taking a personal toll with
cutbacks here at the station.

19:16.025 --> 19:18.361
And since the main Internet
and information cable

19:18.403 --> 19:22.073
had been severed when the
community pool was installed,

19:22.115 --> 19:25.410
Michael suddenly found himself
living in a ghost town

19:25.451 --> 19:27.453
he himself built.

19:33.292 --> 19:35.878
Well, that's not a great sign.

19:47.557 --> 19:50.059
This is why you don't
confide in a competitor.

19:53.146 --> 19:54.480
Michael was desperate to cover

19:54.522 --> 19:56.232
his copious building costs...

19:56.274 --> 19:57.442
Just till I get on my feet.

19:57.483 --> 19:59.152
...so he returned to a woman

19:59.193 --> 20:01.487
he could count on
to put off his downfall.

20:01.529 --> 20:03.322
- I got you!
- Just as he could count on

20:03.364 --> 20:05.366
her putting him off
and falling down.

20:05.408 --> 20:06.784
You did. Bye-bye.

20:06.826 --> 20:08.161
Oop.

20:08.202 --> 20:10.413
That's a hot mess.

20:10.455 --> 20:12.165
But weeks
stretched into months,

20:12.206 --> 20:13.666
and the situation got bleaker.

20:16.627 --> 20:19.547
And it was either this
that made him lose hope...

20:22.467 --> 20:23.760
Love each other.

20:23.801 --> 20:25.595
Pete! Pete!

20:25.636 --> 20:28.473
...or possibly it was
the death of that mailman...

20:28.514 --> 20:29.515
Wait here.

20:29.557 --> 20:30.808
Hang on, Pete!

20:30.850 --> 20:31.809
...but Michael finally gave up.

20:31.851 --> 20:33.227
I got one bar!

20:33.269 --> 20:34.896
And having alienated

20:34.937 --> 20:36.522
everyone else in the family,

20:36.564 --> 20:38.691
turned to the one person
he had left.

20:38.733 --> 20:42.361
I thought we'd have Thanksgiving
here for your senior year.

20:42.403 --> 20:44.906
I don't have a kitchen.

20:44.947 --> 20:46.949
Oh, these are my clothes.

20:48.284 --> 20:50.578
Pete died.

20:50.620 --> 20:52.497
God.

20:52.538 --> 20:56.542
And so Michael moved into
his son's college dorm room.

20:58.586 --> 20:59.837
You are kidding me.

20:59.879 --> 21:01.380
They're gonna be
in seat backs today?

21:01.422 --> 21:02.423
That is great news.

21:02.465 --> 21:04.300
Which, in the new economy,

21:04.342 --> 21:06.344
wasn't as unusual a phenomenon
as you might think.

21:06.385 --> 21:08.304
Don't go through my stuff,
Granddad.

21:08.346 --> 21:10.765
Hey, who do you think
paid for your stuff?

21:10.807 --> 21:12.767
Excuse me. Sorry. Do you know
where George Michael is?

21:12.809 --> 21:14.393
Um, he's in the computer lab.

21:14.435 --> 21:15.895
Great.

21:15.937 --> 21:17.939
- There's a computer lab?
- There's a computer lab?

21:17.980 --> 21:18.940
Huh.

21:18.981 --> 21:20.691
I'm putting up a wall.

21:20.733 --> 21:23.277
We need to rework
our whole system here.

21:23.319 --> 21:25.196
Sounds like you guys are working
on your privacy software, huh?

21:25.238 --> 21:26.489
Hey. How'd you find me?

21:26.531 --> 21:28.449
Uh, Trang's grandfather.

21:28.491 --> 21:31.494
Boy, shoot me if I'm 86, living
in my grandson's dorm, huh?

21:31.536 --> 21:33.538
Pal, good news.

21:33.579 --> 21:35.373
The article that they did on me
in Altitude magazine

21:35.414 --> 21:36.374
comes out today.

21:36.415 --> 21:38.251
You're in Attitude?

21:38.292 --> 21:39.877
That magazine is gay.

21:39.919 --> 21:42.463
Oh, he wasn't being flip
with the word "gay."

21:42.505 --> 21:45.675
Attitude is a British magazine
for homosexuals.

21:45.716 --> 21:47.260
Altitude.

21:47.301 --> 21:48.886
It is OutWest Airlines'
in-flight magazine.

21:48.928 --> 21:49.929
Can I see it?

21:49.971 --> 21:51.681
Probably doesn't have it.

21:51.722 --> 21:53.724
Try finding a flight at this
time of the year.

21:53.766 --> 21:56.477
You ever even been on a plane,
you piece of?

21:57.895 --> 22:00.189
So can I see it?

22:00.231 --> 22:03.234
It-it is not in the terrestrial
newsstands just yet.

22:03.276 --> 22:04.944
Guess what though. You,
my friend, are in the article.

22:04.986 --> 22:06.863
- I'm in it?
- You're in it, you're in it.

22:06.904 --> 22:08.906
I mentioned you; I mentioned
that I'm living in your dorm.

22:08.948 --> 22:11.367
I thought that it might help
with your popularity problem.

22:11.409 --> 22:13.744
Well, I'm gonna get going

22:13.786 --> 22:15.621
- while the room is empty, so...
- Okay. Great.

22:15.663 --> 22:16.998
See you later.

22:17.039 --> 22:18.679
Boy, that's got to
drive you crazy, right?

22:18.708 --> 22:19.876
The whole reason you had to come

22:19.917 --> 22:21.668
to the computer lab
was for privacy.

22:21.711 --> 22:24.005
It's no wonder you can't
get a real girl up there.

22:24.046 --> 22:26.549
Michael was referring
to something he'd walked in on

22:26.591 --> 22:28.009
a few days earlier.

22:28.050 --> 22:29.510
There's a girl in there.

22:29.552 --> 22:31.846
There is?

22:31.888 --> 22:33.890
Where the hell is
George Michael?

22:33.931 --> 22:35.682
- Excuse me. Hello. Oh.
- Dad.

22:35.725 --> 22:36.726
- Hi.
- Yeah.

22:36.767 --> 22:37.894
There's nobody in here.

22:37.935 --> 22:39.729
Buddy, bad news.

22:39.770 --> 22:41.606
P-Hound is yanking
our chain again.

22:41.647 --> 22:43.316
- Uncle Michael.
- Oh, my God.

22:43.357 --> 22:44.442
- Hi.
- Hello there.

22:44.483 --> 22:47.445
There is a kind of girl here.

22:47.486 --> 22:49.030
Didn't say it was your cousin.

22:49.071 --> 22:50.406
Well, he doesn't know.

22:50.448 --> 22:51.698
Now, that's smart.

22:51.741 --> 22:54.368
Let him think
there's a girl in here.

22:54.410 --> 22:56.329
Actually, we've been talking
about how crowded that room is,

22:56.370 --> 22:59.874
and P-Hound was suggesting that
maybe we, maybe we do a vote

22:59.916 --> 23:01.708
to see who stays
in the dorm room.

23:01.751 --> 23:03.544
He suggested that?
Are you serious?

23:03.586 --> 23:06.464
Well, the thing is that the room
is only sanctioned for two.

23:06.505 --> 23:07.673
Right, and we have a vote.

23:07.714 --> 23:08.925
He's gone in two seconds.

23:08.966 --> 23:10.676
Ah.

23:10.717 --> 23:12.053
Two against one, right?

23:12.094 --> 23:13.971
- Well, actually...
- We got to do it.

23:14.013 --> 23:16.599
The thing is that it kind of
puts me in an awkward position.

23:16.641 --> 23:18.309
- Hi.
- Hey.

23:18.351 --> 23:20.061
Because since there's only
three people voting,

23:20.102 --> 23:22.688
everyone's gonna know
who voted against who.

23:22.729 --> 23:24.565
Well, what about if your
"girlfriend" wants to move in.

23:24.607 --> 23:25.691
That way, she gets a vote.

23:26.817 --> 23:28.361
I'm just here for tutoring.

23:28.402 --> 23:29.820
She's not my girlfriend,
she's my cousin.

23:29.862 --> 23:30.905
I'm not attracted to him.

23:30.947 --> 23:32.573
Well, why's that even an issue?

23:32.615 --> 23:34.909
P-Hound doesn't know
any of that stuff. Okay?

23:34.951 --> 23:37.703
He'll just think that her vote's
the vote that got him out.

23:37.744 --> 23:40.581
Well, wouldn't my girlfriend
want to get rid of my father?

23:40.623 --> 23:41.999
- I'm not your girlfriend.
- Not your girlfriend.

23:42.041 --> 23:43.960
No, but he doesn't know that.

23:44.001 --> 23:45.628
No, well, someone's got to vote
for me, that's right.

23:45.670 --> 23:46.963
Otherwise, it's suspicious.

23:47.004 --> 23:48.714
We don't want
a palace coup, right?

23:48.755 --> 23:50.341
- Well, I'll vote you out.
- Yeah, I will.

23:50.383 --> 23:51.801
- Happy to do it.
- I wouldn't make you do that.

23:51.842 --> 23:53.344
You know, then I fall down
a flight of stairs,

23:53.386 --> 23:54.428
I crack my head open,
you feel bad

23:54.470 --> 23:55.513
about yourself your whole life.

23:55.554 --> 23:56.889
And perhaps it was the chair

23:56.931 --> 23:58.724
that fooled Michael
into thinking

23:58.765 --> 24:00.726
his next idea was a good one.

24:00.767 --> 24:03.646
What if I vote myself out?

24:03.688 --> 24:05.398
You'd do that?

24:05.439 --> 24:06.607
How would that help?

24:06.649 --> 24:08.442
It's simple algebra.

24:08.484 --> 24:10.903
You two vote against P-Hound,
nobody knows who did what,

24:10.945 --> 24:13.030
because there's a vote
against me in there,

24:13.072 --> 24:15.116
and it's adios, brothiero.

24:15.157 --> 24:16.867
It cannot fail.

24:16.909 --> 24:19.120
Michael was pleased
with his plan.

24:19.161 --> 24:20.830
Won't that make it a tie?

24:20.871 --> 24:21.831
Briefly.

24:21.872 --> 24:23.374
Hmm?

24:23.416 --> 24:25.001
I mean, if the two of us
vote against P-Hound,

24:25.042 --> 24:26.961
and you and P-Hound
vote against you,

24:27.003 --> 24:28.921
then it's two against two,
right?

24:28.963 --> 24:31.716
Wow, you think, you think
that'd he'd vote against me?

24:31.757 --> 24:33.092
I mean...

24:33.926 --> 24:34.927
Um...

24:34.969 --> 24:36.387
All right, new plan.

24:36.429 --> 24:38.055
The details of the plan

24:38.097 --> 24:39.890
continued to develop
through lunch.

24:39.932 --> 24:41.392
So we got two scenarios.

24:41.434 --> 24:43.436
It's either two votes
against P-Hound,

24:43.477 --> 24:45.146
one vote against Maeby,
one against me,

24:45.187 --> 24:48.607
with that vote being my own;
or if it's two votes against me,

24:48.649 --> 24:50.192
then clearly
P-Hound is being nasty,

24:50.234 --> 24:52.403
that triggers a recount,
and then it's a P-Hound blitz.

24:52.445 --> 24:53.904
We all vote against P-Hound,
he's gone.

24:53.946 --> 24:55.114
Mm-hmm.

24:55.156 --> 24:56.823
What if whoever loses...

24:56.866 --> 24:58.075
Yeah?

24:58.117 --> 25:00.036
...refuses to go?

25:00.077 --> 25:02.455
You think P-Hound would do that?

25:02.496 --> 25:03.914
Okay, new plan.

25:03.956 --> 25:05.583
And so the planning
continued through

25:05.624 --> 25:07.793
what should have been
organic chemistry.

25:07.834 --> 25:09.962
We all pack ahead of time,

25:10.004 --> 25:12.757
really pack a bag, so it doesn't
look rigged, you know?

25:12.798 --> 25:14.383
And then the loser,
straight out the door.

25:14.425 --> 25:15.842
I mean, that's-that's the deal.

25:15.885 --> 25:17.636
You know, that's the cost
of having a vote,

25:17.678 --> 25:18.637
that's the price of freedom.

25:18.679 --> 25:20.097
You know, maybe it's...

25:20.139 --> 25:21.640
maybe it's better
if we're all just

25:21.682 --> 25:22.975
direct with each other,
you know?

25:23.017 --> 25:24.518
Just-just say
what's on our minds.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.062
Yeah, I think it's gonna
come out anyway.

25:26.103 --> 25:30.566
Um, Dad, you know, I-I've really
loved living with you...

25:30.608 --> 25:31.609
No talking.

25:33.235 --> 25:35.488
No talking
once the votes come in.

25:35.529 --> 25:37.156
You're just right out the door.
That's the missing piece.

25:37.198 --> 25:38.824
That's it.

25:38.865 --> 25:40.659
This plan is foolproof.

25:40.701 --> 25:43.454
Oh, I've cherished this,
too, pal.

25:43.496 --> 25:44.997
Yeah. I mean, how many,
how many fathers

25:45.039 --> 25:46.916
get to go to college
with their kid, huh?

25:46.957 --> 25:49.043
So obviously
this is what happened.

25:49.085 --> 25:51.878
Michael read
his own vote first.

25:51.921 --> 25:54.924
First vote to remove...

25:54.965 --> 25:56.092
Michael.

25:56.133 --> 25:57.760
Huh, what are you gonna do?

25:59.136 --> 26:02.223
Second vote to remove...

26:04.475 --> 26:06.102
...Michael.

26:06.143 --> 26:09.772
Michael expected this,
but didn't expect the sting.

26:09.814 --> 26:11.690
Wow.

26:11.732 --> 26:15.194
Obviously, if there's a tie,
there's an immediate runoff.

26:15.236 --> 26:17.904
Third vote to remove...

26:19.198 --> 26:21.200
...Michael.

26:27.998 --> 26:30.668
Did you mean
to write "George Michael"?

26:30.709 --> 26:33.629
Obviously, the verdict was in.

26:33.671 --> 26:35.673
And it's hard to know exactly

26:35.714 --> 26:37.508
why Michael opened
the fourth ballot.

26:37.550 --> 26:41.512
Was it out of hope
or confusion?

26:41.554 --> 26:44.765
Either way, it couldn't be
what he wanted to read.

27:04.827 --> 27:08.205
Michael did the only thing
he could think of

27:08.247 --> 27:10.791
that would save face.

27:30.686 --> 27:33.772
Michael had just been
stunned by some bad news.

27:33.814 --> 27:35.649
And with nowhere to go,
he decided

27:35.691 --> 27:38.444
to pick up a copy of Altitude
to lift his spirits.

27:38.486 --> 27:39.945
- Hi. Hello.
- Hey.

27:39.986 --> 27:41.530
Where you heading today, sir?

27:41.572 --> 27:43.199
Well, actually,
I just wanted a copy

27:43.240 --> 27:45.451
of your in-flight magazine
Altitude.

27:45.493 --> 27:47.453
Ah, this is ticketing.

27:47.495 --> 27:49.580
You can get the magazine
on the flight.

27:49.622 --> 27:52.291
I get it. But I'm actually-- 
I'm in the magazine.

27:52.333 --> 27:53.751
How many bags?

27:55.169 --> 27:56.295
Oh, I'm not checking these.

27:56.337 --> 27:57.338
Ah, sorry, you actually

27:57.379 --> 27:58.923
can't carry those on board.

27:58.964 --> 28:00.716
Let me start over.

28:00.758 --> 28:02.843
Uh, I-I am the star of
Altitude magazine this month--

28:02.885 --> 28:04.762
or quarter, actually.

28:04.803 --> 28:07.515
It's an April-September issue,
and I just wanted to get a copy.

28:07.556 --> 28:08.933
I'm not flying anywhere.

28:08.974 --> 28:10.351
Why do you have suitcases?

28:10.392 --> 28:11.644
Those are irrelevant.

28:11.685 --> 28:12.728
Not to me.

28:12.770 --> 28:14.688
Okay.

28:14.730 --> 28:17.733
I was mistakenly voted out of
a four-person housing situation,

28:17.775 --> 28:20.486
uh, in a pack-first,
no-talking-after scenario.

28:20.528 --> 28:21.862
Does that clear it up for you?

28:21.904 --> 28:24.365
What do you mean
by "mistakenly"?

28:24.406 --> 28:26.534
I voted against myself to spare
my son the embarrassment

28:26.575 --> 28:29.495
of, of having to vote
his own father out of his dorm.

28:29.537 --> 28:30.704
That's all.

28:30.746 --> 28:32.331
But that leaves
three other votes.

28:32.373 --> 28:33.499
Yeah.

28:33.541 --> 28:35.376
Can I get a copy
of the magazine, please?

28:35.417 --> 28:37.753
No, I'm sorry,
they're actually for passengers.

28:37.795 --> 28:39.505
We don't even give out
honey nuts, so we're not gonna

28:39.547 --> 28:41.674
- give you a magazine.
- Who wants honey nuts?

28:41.715 --> 28:42.883
I don't want the honey nuts.

28:42.925 --> 28:44.218
I want to just jump
onto the plane,

28:44.260 --> 28:45.427
- grab a magazine.
- Oh, okay,

28:45.469 --> 28:46.845
yeah, sure, we just, uh,
let people walk

28:46.887 --> 28:48.389
onto the plane all the time.

28:48.430 --> 28:50.933
Do you want a box cutter also?

28:50.975 --> 28:52.560
- Oh.
- Nice.

28:52.601 --> 28:54.478
These guys are jerks.

28:54.520 --> 28:55.729
Take that, take that.

28:55.771 --> 28:58.482
Enjoy.

28:58.524 --> 28:59.733
Tell you what-- 
give me a one- way ticket

28:59.775 --> 29:01.819
to your cheapest destination,
please.

29:01.860 --> 29:04.363
Oh, you lucked out.

29:04.405 --> 29:06.323
Today it's Pittsburgh.

29:06.365 --> 29:08.659
He's good.

29:08.701 --> 29:10.452
What's the second cheapest?

29:10.494 --> 29:12.413
So Michael ended up
spending a little more

29:12.454 --> 29:14.248
to fly a little less,

29:14.290 --> 29:16.584
and after some confusion
at security...

29:16.625 --> 29:17.876
But you've got nothing
in your luggage.

29:17.918 --> 29:18.961
I wasn't supposed to be
traveling today.

29:19.003 --> 29:20.546
I told you, it was

29:20.588 --> 29:21.630
a voting situation, there was a
miscalculation.

29:21.672 --> 29:22.923
Well, I mean, obviously

29:22.965 --> 29:24.508
P-Hound's gonna vote
against you.

29:24.550 --> 29:26.302
- I've never seen nothing...
- These three people with burkas

29:26.343 --> 29:28.012
just walked right by you.

29:28.053 --> 29:30.389
...he found his seat.

29:30.431 --> 29:33.475
Unfortunately the seat
he was assigned didn't have

29:33.517 --> 29:35.394
a seat back pocket.

29:35.436 --> 29:38.522
Hello, hi,
does each ticket entitle

29:38.564 --> 29:40.274
the passenger
to an in-flight magazine?

29:40.316 --> 29:41.775
No, it only guarantees you
a seat.

29:41.817 --> 29:43.777
Perhaps I can ask
another passenger for one,

29:43.819 --> 29:45.863
or if I'd rather, you can.

29:45.904 --> 29:48.741
Michael had
to go back four seats

29:48.782 --> 29:51.118
before someone would.

29:56.081 --> 29:58.834
And Michael kicked himself
for a pose

29:58.876 --> 30:02.046
he thought would express
humility to Sanjiv,

30:02.087 --> 30:05.007
the Altitude photographer.

30:05.049 --> 30:07.509
And so Michael--

30:07.551 --> 30:10.429
a man who'd for years
threatened to leave

30:10.471 --> 30:13.807
his family but had always
stayed for his son,

30:13.849 --> 30:17.811
a man who no longer had that
excuse nor anywhere to live--

30:17.853 --> 30:20.356
found himself
with nothing to lose

30:20.397 --> 30:22.983
in a town
that he'd always imagined

30:23.025 --> 30:25.027
would be his destiny,

30:25.069 --> 30:28.572
and for the first time
in many years,

30:28.614 --> 30:30.616
Michael had hope.

30:36.705 --> 30:38.832
Michael steps out
of the air-conditioned airport.

30:38.874 --> 30:41.835
Hope you know a good place
to live because I'm...

30:41.877 --> 30:44.421
Ooh, dear Lord.

30:44.463 --> 30:45.964
'Cause I'm looking

30:46.006 --> 30:47.800
- to make a new start.
- Don't touch that handle.

30:47.841 --> 30:49.134
Whoa, Mother of God!

30:49.176 --> 30:51.095
Dear Lord!

30:51.136 --> 30:52.513
Whoo!

30:52.554 --> 30:54.515
And Michael returns

30:54.556 --> 30:58.435
to the only viable place
he can think of to live...

30:58.477 --> 31:00.771
Gentlemen, start your engines.

31:00.813 --> 31:03.565
...where he begins his new life
cleaning up

31:03.607 --> 31:05.567
after his family's old one.

31:05.609 --> 31:07.152
Buster.

31:07.194 --> 31:11.448
No... no, Gob.

31:11.490 --> 31:13.450
Oh!

31:13.492 --> 31:15.494
It was Lindsay.
