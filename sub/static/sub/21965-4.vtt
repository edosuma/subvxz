Find anything?

00:17.000 --> 00:19.750
Not in this fog.

00:19.792 --> 00:23.625
Sir, driftwood could easily

00:19.792 --> 00:23.625
be mistaken for a sea monster.

00:23.667 --> 00:25.542
Perhaps that is what

00:23.667 --> 00:25.542
the captain saw.

00:25.583 --> 00:28.041
But this driftwood apparently

00:25.583 --> 00:28.041
circled the ferry

00:28.083 --> 00:31.709
on three separate days.

00:28.083 --> 00:31.709

Excellent aim, sir.

as to what was gained

Speaking of close, how about

02:42.667 --> 02:46.166
we fly at a higher altitude?

02:46.208 --> 02:48.500
Higher? Alert the media.

02:48.542 --> 02:50.583
Well, it's a known fact

02:48.542 --> 02:50.583
that sea monsters

like to pull

02:50.625 --> 02:52.333

What kind of iceberg is this?

04:24.375 --> 04:27.750
It's not an iceberg.

04:24.375 --> 04:27.750
It's a ship covered in ice.

04:31.667 --> 04:33.834
Let's look around.

04:31.667 --> 04:33.834
Excuse me,

04:33.875 --> 04:37.041
but exploring ghost ships

04:33.875 --> 04:37.041
requires the whole rescue team.

04:37.083 --> 04:39.291
And the Navy.

04:39.333 --> 04:41.250
And I'd give

04:39.333 --> 04:41.250
Optimus a call too!

04:46.583 --> 04:48.917
Huh.

04:46.583 --> 04:48.917
Here's the ship's log.

04:48.959 --> 04:50.625
It says we're on

04:48.959 --> 04:50.625
the  S.S. Isolde.

04:50.667 --> 04:52.500
Cody,

04:50.667 --> 04:52.500
call this in to Dad.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.375
I'll search

04:52.542 --> 04:54.375
for any passengers.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.834
The  Isolde?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.834
And it doesn't look like

04:57.875 --> 05:00.000
anyone's been inside

04:57.875 --> 05:00.000
here for years.

05:00.041 --> 05:04.208
Probably because that

05:00.041 --> 05:04.208
freighter was lost in 1966.

05:04.250 --> 05:05.667
You know something

05:04.250 --> 05:05.667
about it, Dad?

05:05.709 --> 05:07.375
The  Isolde

05:05.709 --> 05:07.375
was used to transport

05:07.417 --> 05:09.500
experimental tech

05:07.417 --> 05:09.500
to Griffin Rock.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.667
So what happened?

05:09.542 --> 05:11.667
The captain and crew

05:11.709 --> 05:15.250
had to abandon ship after

05:11.709 --> 05:15.250
certain cargo became unstable.

05:15.291 --> 05:17.542
It says here the captain

05:15.291 --> 05:17.542
was Zachary Burns.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.625
Ah! Great Grandpa?

05:19.667 --> 05:22.375
Yep.

05:19.667 --> 05:22.375
He never talked about it,

05:22.417 --> 05:24.792
but whatever happened onboard

05:22.417 --> 05:24.792
really spooked him.

05:24.834 --> 05:27.667
So finish the search,

05:24.834 --> 05:27.667
and hightail it off of there.

05:30.375 --> 05:32.583
Is this your

05:30.375 --> 05:32.583
great-grandfather, Cody?

05:32.625 --> 05:36.375
I'm not sure, I've never

05:32.625 --> 05:36.375
seen a picture of him.

05:36.417 --> 05:39.625
But if it is, I bet my Dad

05:36.417 --> 05:39.625
would love to have this.

05:39.667 --> 05:41.709
He and his grandpa

05:39.667 --> 05:41.709
were really close.

05:41.750 --> 05:44.208

05:41.750 --> 05:44.208
DANI: Hey, guys.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.291
Didn't find anyone onboard.

05:46.333 --> 05:49.875
But wanna bet that's what's

05:46.333 --> 05:49.875
causing the deep freeze?

05:49.917 --> 05:53.583
Because someone left

According to Doc Greene,

06:37.166 --> 06:41.041
lab records from 1966

06:41.083 --> 06:44.917
show most of the  Isolde's

06:41.083 --> 06:44.917
cargo was top secret.

06:44.959 --> 06:48.291
Except for this,

06:44.959 --> 06:48.291
the subzero expander.

06:50.333 --> 06:53.583
Divert your eyes, Blades.

Heh. Too bad their subzero

07:00.291 --> 07:04.041

07:04.083 --> 07:06.083
Thing's obviously a hazard.

07:06.125 --> 07:07.750
We can't just leave

something like that

07:07.792 --> 07:09.959
drifting around where people

07:07.792 --> 07:09.959
might run into it again.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.917
BOTH:

07:10.000 --> 07:12.917
I say we blow it up. Huh?

07:12.959 --> 07:16.625
Figures it would take explosives

07:12.959 --> 07:16.625
to make you two agree.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.667
But we can't destroy

07:16.667 --> 07:18.667
Great Grandpa's ship.

07:18.709 --> 07:21.667
And not recovering that old tech

07:18.709 --> 07:21.667
would be a missed opportunity.

on this one.

10:24.959 --> 10:27.291
showing up here, Morocco.

10:27.333 --> 10:29.000
There's still a warrant out

10:27.333 --> 10:29.000
for your arrest.

10:29.041 --> 10:32.166
Pish-posh. The mayor and I

10:29.041 --> 10:32.166
patched things up

10:32.208 --> 10:35.166
as soon as I returned

10:32.208 --> 10:35.166
his missing schooner.

10:35.208 --> 10:37.834
What did you mean by

10:35.208 --> 10:37.834
we're trespassing?

10:37.875 --> 10:40.834
Finders keepers.

10:40.875 --> 10:42.792
Pfft! Like that'll

10:40.875 --> 10:42.792
hold up in court.

10:42.834 --> 10:44.875
Unfortunately, it will.

10:44.917 --> 10:46.500
Naval salvage laws say

10:46.542 --> 10:48.458
that whoever finds

10:46.542 --> 10:48.458
an abandoned ship--

10:48.500 --> 10:50.875
MOROCCO:

10:48.500 --> 10:50.875
Gets to claim it

10:48.500 --> 10:50.875
and its cargo.

10:50.917 --> 10:54.041
Signed by your mayor

10:50.917 --> 10:54.041
this very morning.

10:54.083 --> 10:57.291
The  S.S. Isolde

10:54.083 --> 10:57.291
and everything on board

10:57.333 --> 10:59.625
belongs to yours truly.

10:59.667 --> 11:01.959
CODY ( over radio ):

10:59.667 --> 11:01.959
I'm calling the mayor now, Dad.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.041
Doctor Morocco,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.041
some of that cargo

11:04.083 --> 11:05.667
is really unstable.

11:05.709 --> 11:07.542
Seriously,

11:05.709 --> 11:07.542
do you not see the ice?

11:07.583 --> 11:10.667
Such concern

11:07.583 --> 11:10.667
does warm the heart.

11:10.709 --> 11:14.208
That said, I demand

11:10.709 --> 11:14.208
that you cease interfering

11:14.250 --> 11:16.625
with my salvage operation.

11:18.041 --> 11:20.709
Dad? Ah.

11:18.041 --> 11:20.709
The mayor confirmed it.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.125
The  Isolde  belongs

11:20.750 --> 11:23.125
to Doctor Morocco.

11:24.625 --> 11:27.125
All right, team.

11:24.625 --> 11:27.125
We've done all we can here.

11:29.709 --> 11:33.041
(  ominous theme playing  )

11:37.417 --> 11:39.917
Unbelievable.

11:39.959 --> 11:42.583
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

11:51.834 --> 11:53.709
"Final log entry.

11:53.750 --> 11:56.125
"We've received instructions

11:53.750 --> 11:56.125
from the Griffin Rock Lab

11:56.166 --> 11:58.083
to abandon ship..."

11:58.125 --> 12:01.041
Dad! Listen to Captain Burns'

11:58.125 --> 12:01.041
final log entry.

12:01.083 --> 12:02.750
"Any attempt to move

12:01.083 --> 12:02.750
the damaged subzero expander

"...and flash freeze

12:06.333 --> 12:08.125
everything within five miles."

12:08.166 --> 12:10.875
That's why Great Grandpa

12:08.166 --> 12:10.875
never went back for it!

12:10.917 --> 12:14.625
Morocco putting only himself

12:10.917 --> 12:14.625
in danger is one thing.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.291
Cody, check for any other

12:14.667 --> 12:17.291
craft in the area.

12:26.709 --> 12:28.458
CODY:

12:26.709 --> 12:28.458
The ferry!

12:28.500 --> 12:31.792
Captain Shaw, turn around!

12:28.500 --> 12:31.792
You have to change course!

12:31.834 --> 12:34.709
SHAW:

12:31.834 --> 12:34.709
Attention, all passengers!

12:34.750 --> 12:38.083
Please take shelter

12:34.750 --> 12:38.083
in your cars immediately!

12:38.125 --> 12:40.625
And welcome to Griffin Rock.

( passengers chattering )

12:45.000 --> 12:48.250
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

12:58.834 --> 13:01.667
Doctor, you need

12:58.834 --> 13:01.667
to evacuate now!

13:01.709 --> 13:03.125
( groans )

13:05.333 --> 13:08.917
Chief Burns, I've grown weary

13:05.333 --> 13:08.917
of this debate.

13:08.959 --> 13:11.458
Your grandfather's ship

13:08.959 --> 13:11.458
is now mine.

13:16.542 --> 13:18.875
The expander

13:16.542 --> 13:18.875
is going ballistic.

13:18.917 --> 13:22.792
Fire Bot, assist Doctor Morocco

13:18.917 --> 13:22.792
into his submarine.

13:22.834 --> 13:24.333
( in robotic tone ):

13:22.834 --> 13:24.333
As commanded.

13:30.750 --> 13:32.291
Unhand me!

13:34.208 --> 13:36.166
Oh, Chief Burns,

13:36.208 --> 13:39.458
I'll have you up on charges!

13:36.208 --> 13:39.458
Do you hear?

13:42.125 --> 13:45.709
That man is not humankind's

13:42.125 --> 13:45.709
greatest example.

13:50.333 --> 13:52.583
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

13:52.625 --> 13:55.041
I don't think we're gonna

13:52.625 --> 13:55.041
make it out of range in time.

13:55.083 --> 13:57.834
Vehicle modes! Now!

13:57.875 --> 14:00.583
(  dramatic theme playing  )

14:08.458 --> 14:11.709
CODY ( over radio ):

14:08.458 --> 14:11.709
Captain Shaw, one more mile

14:08.458 --> 14:11.709
and you're in the clear.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.583
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

14:19.792 --> 14:21.959
Not again.

14:30.375 --> 14:31.375
Oh, no!

14:33.959 --> 14:36.458
(  somber theme playing  )

14:39.250 --> 14:40.583
Oh, my.

14:40.625 --> 14:42.917
( gull cawing )

14:50.041 --> 14:52.917
Uh, Ch-Chase?

14:52.959 --> 14:54.625
I am f-fine, sir.

14:54.667 --> 14:56.500
Except for the p-p-parts

14:54.667 --> 14:56.500
which are i-immobile.

14:58.375 --> 15:02.500
Unh! Kade, Dani, Graham,

14:58.375 --> 15:02.500
do you read?

15:02.542 --> 15:04.250
( grunting )

15:05.875 --> 15:07.875
Come on, Heatwave, open up!

15:07.917 --> 15:10.834
Can't.

15:07.917 --> 15:10.834
F-Frozen solid!

15:12.834 --> 15:16.333
Unh! I-I th-think

15:12.834 --> 15:16.333
I can move us.

15:16.375 --> 15:17.709
No, don't!

15:20.583 --> 15:22.458
( Graham screams )

15:23.750 --> 15:25.750
( groans )

15:26.959 --> 15:28.917
We moved.

15:34.583 --> 15:36.208
DANI:

15:34.583 --> 15:36.208
Try opening your canopy.

15:36.250 --> 15:38.375
Still stuck. Wait!

15:38.417 --> 15:40.959
No. Still stuck.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.834
( groans )

15:44.834 --> 15:47.458
( passengers chattering )

15:47.500 --> 15:49.583
(  upbeat theme playing  )

15:56.750 --> 15:58.750
Dad, are you all right?

15:58.792 --> 16:00.375
Anybody?

16:04.834 --> 16:06.917
( sighs )

16:06.959 --> 16:09.875
( engine starts )

16:09.917 --> 16:13.542
(  dramatic theme playing  )

16:16.875 --> 16:19.000
( car engines starting )

16:36.083 --> 16:38.834
CHASE:

16:36.083 --> 16:38.834
Cody, you are a sight

16:36.083 --> 16:38.834
for cold optics.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.792
Just give it a second

16:40.375 --> 16:42.792
to work, Chase.

16:42.834 --> 16:44.417
HEATWAVE:

16:42.834 --> 16:44.417
Me next.

16:44.458 --> 16:45.875
( grunting )

16:47.291 --> 16:49.542
Kade's overstayed

16:47.291 --> 16:49.542
his welcome.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.709
Nice work, Cody.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.709
Oh, you're a life-saver.

16:55.750 --> 16:58.000
I'd have busted out of there

16:55.750 --> 16:58.000
sooner or later.

16:58.041 --> 16:59.291
Did the town get hit?

16:59.333 --> 17:01.083
It's only icy

16:59.333 --> 17:01.083
up to the shoreline.

17:01.125 --> 17:03.458
Looks like you got

17:01.125 --> 17:03.458
the worst of it right here.

17:03.500 --> 17:07.458
Dani, check the subzero expander

17:03.500 --> 17:07.458
while we help Doctor Morocco.

17:10.542 --> 17:12.834
That machine has

17:10.542 --> 17:12.834
frozen its last bot.

17:12.875 --> 17:15.750
When I'm warmer,

17:12.875 --> 17:15.750
I'll jump for joy.

17:18.417 --> 17:19.834
Now look who abandoned ship.

17:19.875 --> 17:21.583
Well, that means

17:19.875 --> 17:21.583
he's all right.

17:21.625 --> 17:24.959
So what now? drive home

17:21.625 --> 17:24.959
or wait for the ice to melt?

17:25.000 --> 17:27.375
Hmm. Doesn't look

17:25.000 --> 17:27.375
very thick.

17:27.417 --> 17:31.125
Probably already melting,

17:27.417 --> 17:31.125
at least at the outer edges.

17:31.166 --> 17:34.041
Melting? But I saw

17:31.166 --> 17:34.041
four cars from the ferry

17:34.083 --> 17:36.208
driving across the ice

17:34.083 --> 17:36.208
back to town!

17:36.250 --> 17:38.291
Can you get there in time?

17:36.250 --> 17:38.291
We're on it.

17:38.333 --> 17:41.000
Rescue Bots,

17:38.333 --> 17:41.000
roll to the rescue!

17:41.041 --> 17:44.041
(  dramatic theme playing  )

18:16.500 --> 18:18.291
The ship's breaking loose

18:16.500 --> 18:18.291
from the ice field!

18:18.333 --> 18:20.166
Everyone, get to the boat!

18:24.000 --> 18:26.667
(  dramatic theme playing  )

18:41.291 --> 18:43.542
( grunting )

18:48.917 --> 18:51.250
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

18:51.291 --> 18:52.750
( grunts )

18:59.500 --> 19:01.000
( gasps then grunts )

19:07.709 --> 19:09.333
Watch out!

19:12.083 --> 19:15.834
Dad!

19:12.083 --> 19:15.834
Careful! We're taking on water!

19:15.875 --> 19:18.625
Don't panic. Make sure

19:15.875 --> 19:18.625
your life jackets are secure!

19:18.667 --> 19:20.333
( gasps )

19:20.375 --> 19:23.208
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

19:27.875 --> 19:29.917
Didn't see that coming.

19:33.166 --> 19:36.375
(  upbeat theme playing  )

19:49.583 --> 19:51.500
( in robotic tone ):

19:49.583 --> 19:51.500
You are safe now.

19:51.542 --> 19:54.125
( in robotic tone ):

19:51.542 --> 19:54.125
Drive carefully.

19:51.542 --> 19:54.125
Avoid ice.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.917
Was that--?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.917
BURNS: Yes.

20:11.959 --> 20:14.667
Doctor Morocco actually

20:11.959 --> 20:14.667
came to our rescue.

20:14.709 --> 20:17.583
I'm sure he thinks that makes up

20:14.709 --> 20:17.583
for everything else he's done.

20:17.625 --> 20:19.291
Still, I never

20:17.625 --> 20:19.291
would have guessed

20:19.333 --> 20:21.375
that man had

20:19.333 --> 20:21.375
a grateful bone in his body.

20:21.417 --> 20:23.041
CHASE:

20:21.417 --> 20:23.041
A grateful bone?

20:23.083 --> 20:24.917
Where exactly on a human

20:23.083 --> 20:24.917
is that located?

20:24.959 --> 20:28.000
Probably next to the funny bone

20:24.959 --> 20:28.000
we've heard about.

20:35.083 --> 20:38.291
The ferry's back,

20:35.083 --> 20:38.291
but no sign of the  Isolde.

20:38.333 --> 20:40.125
Do you think

20:38.333 --> 20:40.125
Morocco took her?

20:40.166 --> 20:41.834
Well, chances are.

20:41.875 --> 20:43.709
Let's just hope

20:41.875 --> 20:43.709
any tech he got away with

20:43.750 --> 20:45.166
is too old to be useful.

20:45.208 --> 20:47.625
( doorbell rings )

20:58.417 --> 21:00.375
What is it, son?

21:00.417 --> 21:03.542
The portrait that was hanging

21:00.417 --> 21:03.542
in the  Isolde's  cargo hold.

21:03.583 --> 21:06.291
Grandpa Zachary.

21:06.333 --> 21:10.041
I haven't looked into that face

21:06.333 --> 21:10.041
for a long, long time.

21:10.083 --> 21:12.959
Hmm, maybe there's hope

21:10.083 --> 21:12.959
for Doctor Morocco yet.

21:16.542 --> 21:20.417
(  ominous theme playing  )

21:24.041 --> 21:28.291
Oh, my,

21:24.041 --> 21:28.291
just what the doctor ordered.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.125
(  dramatic theme playing  )
