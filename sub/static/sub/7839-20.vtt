00:51.810 --> 00:54.089
Are you sure we can make 
money doing this?

00:54.232 --> 00:57.270
What if nobody wants their 
address painted on the curb?

00:57.747 --> 01:01.480
Duh! Nobody wants their 
address painted on the curb.

01:02.142 --> 01:04.977
We do it without asking, 
and then they have to pay.

01:05.117 --> 01:06.795
What are you punks doin'?!

01:07.362 --> 01:10.212
Answer me, or I'll drop ya 
like a bad cell phone plan!

01:11.171 --> 01:13.202
Sorry. This thing goes off on its own.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.477
Anyway, you were sayin'?

01:15.528 --> 01:16.094
Ignore that.

01:16.445 --> 01:17.972
We painted your address on the curb.

01:18.092 --> 01:20.838
And, since you didn't tell us 
not to, you owe us ten bucks.

01:20.918 --> 01:22.614
Wow. A number on the curb?

01:22.648 --> 01:24.688
That really classes the joint up.

01:26.058 --> 01:28.571
Yep, things are finally going my way.

01:30.276 --> 01:31.331
I struck oil!

01:31.356 --> 01:32.361
I struck oil!

01:33.875 --> 01:35.120
I struck oil!

01:36.037 --> 01:38.312
When do we tell him that's not oil?

01:38.516 --> 01:40.240
Let him have his fun.

01:40.427 --> 01:42.281
Oil! Oil!

01:42.608 --> 01:45.950
Only ten dollars to paint my 
curb like a common whore?

01:46.006 --> 01:48.361
Well, I'm happy to pay for a three-digit spray.

01:48.515 --> 01:51.721
Tell you what-- I'll give you another 
hundred if you paint my garage.

01:51.776 --> 01:52.363
Wait a minute.

01:52.405 --> 01:53.760
That's not a scam!

01:53.997 --> 01:55.763
That's honest work for honest pay!

01:55.875 --> 01:57.462
No!

01:58.505 --> 02:00.632
I'll throw in some christian comic books!

02:00.737 --> 02:01.710
Please!

02:01.768 --> 02:03.203
Somebody take them!

02:04.298 --> 02:05.580
Screw you.

02:05.646 --> 02:07.010
I'm never going to pay.

02:07.086 --> 02:10.203
Well, then we're gonna leave you one digit short.

02:11.577 --> 02:12.163
Fine.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.583
I'll finish it myself.

02:13.606 --> 02:17.183
And don't think I'm gonna 
screw it up, because I won't!

02:24.927 --> 02:27.573
Dad, all you had to do was paint one number.

02:27.615 --> 02:30.012
Now no one's going to be 
able to find our house.

02:30.057 --> 02:34.242
But, sweetie, I just wanted to tell the 
'74 Oakland A's how I felt about them.

02:34.765 --> 02:36.903
Look, that guy remembers us!

02:37.056 --> 02:39.940
Hey, sal bando, give him a '74 a's

02:39.965 --> 02:41.300
"thank you honk."

02:43.898 --> 02:45.820
My work here is done.

02:56.906 --> 02:58.581
I'm needed at the door!

03:00.977 --> 03:07.202
I have a delivery for a Scott and 
Brenda Weingarten, 74 Evergreen Terrace.

03:07.456 --> 03:10.862
74? Oh, sorry. There's been a mistake.

03:10.977 --> 03:12.180
Oh, no problem.

03:12.358 --> 03:15.523
I'll just ship these juicy 
mail-order steaks back to Omaha.

03:15.566 --> 03:20.011
On second thought, i am Brenda Winecooler.

03:21.268 --> 03:24.883
Dad, isn't it wrong to open 
or eat other people's mail?

03:25.846 --> 03:28.713
Son, all our mail has ever 
brought me is bad things:

03:28.798 --> 03:31.571
Bills, jury duty, Entertainment Weekly.

03:31.678 --> 03:34.351
Now, for once, I'm getting rich-person mail.

03:34.518 --> 03:36.702
You wouldn't take that away 
from me, would you, son?

03:37.036 --> 03:39.962
Oh, dad, no one can rationalize like you.

03:40.298 --> 03:43.662
Okay, weingartens, what 
else is in your mail?

03:44.527 --> 03:47.720
Ooh! Marge, do you wanna go to 
a wedding of a couple we never met?

03:47.796 --> 03:49.533
Strangers getting married?

03:49.618 --> 03:51.563
I wouldn't miss itfor the world.

03:51.967 --> 03:56.003
Mark and Tracy, I remember 
the first words I heard you say:

03:56.366 --> 03:57.500
"I do."

03:57.937 --> 03:59.932
Your cousin Scottis so sweet.

03:59.955 --> 04:01.790
But didn't you sayhe was blind?

04:01.846 --> 04:04.870
That's what I heard, but he's 
so confident in his movements.

04:10.866 --> 04:13.560
This is kent brockman, 
in the springfield keys,

04:13.617 --> 04:15.722
reporting to you from 
the middle of a hurricane.

04:15.748 --> 04:19.163
The lid from my coffee cupis long gone.

04:21.098 --> 04:23.681
I'm scared, people. Truly scared.

04:23.717 --> 04:26.511
Take that, liberal media.

04:26.627 --> 04:29.793
Homer! This says I've won 
homemaker magazine's

04:29.807 --> 04:31.861
"clean for a day" contest!

04:32.037 --> 04:35.681
"A highly skilled professional 
will come to your home

04:35.727 --> 04:39.230
and clean it top to 
bottom while you relax."

04:39.607 --> 04:40.642
But how could I have won?

04:40.727 --> 04:42.940
I don't subscribe to this periodical.

04:42.968 --> 04:45.602
Marge, I don't have to sit 
here and listen to your

04:45.636 --> 04:47.783
insane ravings about me 
getting other people's mail.

04:49.498 --> 04:52.251
Hi. I'm Brenda Weingarten.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.062
Mom, what are you doing?

04:56.256 --> 04:58.593
Cleaning up before the housekeeper comes.

04:58.876 --> 05:01.790
This is a total stranger who 
cleans houses for a living.

05:01.816 --> 05:03.183
Who  cares what she thinks?

05:03.248 --> 05:04.950
Don't be so naive, Lisa.

05:05.018 --> 05:07.001
Those people all talk to each other.

05:08.245 --> 05:11.101
You know what I found in 
their dirty clothes hamper?

05:11.175 --> 05:12.902
Dirty clothes!

05:13.075 --> 05:15.161
I found a hair in the drain.

05:15.337 --> 05:19.010
Not a fine upstanding head hair, 
but a curly-wurly!

05:19.335 --> 05:22.870
Untidy! Untidy! Untidy!

05:24.915 --> 05:27.373
Untidy! Untidy! Untidy!

05:30.275 --> 05:33.670
Now, this is a house that's 
ready to be cleaned!

05:39.775 --> 05:42.082
That's her! Don't answer it yet!

05:42.127 --> 05:44.512
I don't want that judgmental 
bitch in my house!

05:46.576 --> 05:50.173
Maple syrup mixed with baby 
spit-up and shoe scuff?

05:50.327 --> 05:53.150
This is going to take my whole arsenal at once!

06:12.545 --> 06:14.692
Et tu, zud?

06:21.035 --> 06:22.763
Ah! She's opening her eyes!

06:23.227 --> 06:27.841
Oh! My head feels like it 
was punched by a boxing man.

06:28.095 --> 06:29.572
How many fingers am I holding up?

06:29.668 --> 06:30.201
Two.

06:30.328 --> 06:31.703
Very good.

06:31.897 --> 06:34.193
Now I'll put them backin the jar.

06:34.815 --> 06:36.423
Now I have a question.

06:36.715 --> 06:38.411
Who are you people?!

06:39.206 --> 06:40.963
she doesn't recognize us!

06:41.115 --> 06:42.150
You monster!

06:42.408 --> 06:44.431
What have you done to my face?!

06:51.288 --> 06:52.710
When will Marge remember us?

06:52.937 --> 06:56.103
It's hard to say, with 
retrograde amnesia such as this,

06:56.167 --> 06:58.410
the patient could forget 
years and years of her life.

06:58.577 --> 07:01.100
You just have to keep jogging 
her memory till it works.

07:01.887 --> 07:02.770
Jogging?!

07:02.816 --> 07:04.733
I didn't say you should be jogging.

07:04.896 --> 07:05.670
Sweet.

07:05.778 --> 07:07.101
Although you should be jogging.

07:07.847 --> 07:08.623
J ogging?!

07:09.107 --> 07:13.761
Marge, I'm gonna take care of you 
until your amnesia goes scram-nesia.

07:13.965 --> 07:15.611
I got you flowers...

07:16.646 --> 07:19.991
...Fluffy pillow, and a nice, 
relaxing private room.

07:23.647 --> 07:24.853
You're sweet.

07:25.005 --> 07:27.831
I'm lucky to have such a kind... uncle?

07:27.897 --> 07:28.882
I'm your husband!

07:29.176 --> 07:31.443
Whaaaaat?

07:31.687 --> 07:33.310
I am. We're the same age.

07:33.397 --> 07:34.903
But you're so much more...

07:35.286 --> 07:37.232
ravaged than I am.

07:38.415 --> 07:39.851
I do eat a lot of crap.

07:41.178 --> 07:46.341
I'm  Lisa, I'm eight years old, and 
this might sound presumptuous, but...

07:46.396 --> 07:47.733
I'm your favorite.

07:47.927 --> 07:51.721
You seem sweet, but I could 
never have a favorite.

07:51.917 --> 07:53.943
Well, talk to me in a week.

07:54.287 --> 07:55.553
Hi. I'm Bart.

07:55.726 --> 07:58.842
I'm ten years old and a 
professional motocross jumper.

07:59.406 --> 08:00.800
Can you buy me a motocross bike?

08:00.927 --> 08:03.621
I may have lost my memory, but I'm not an idiot.

08:04.996 --> 08:06.511
Great news, Marge, we're going home.

08:06.595 --> 08:10.230
Yes, the insurance company said 
you're as well as they're gonna pay for.

08:12.306 --> 08:15.472
I can't wait to see what 
kind of home we live in.

08:15.568 --> 08:17.092
Oh, it's great!

08:17.246 --> 08:19.343
Like somebody barfed a two-story pile of puke.

08:19.407 --> 08:20.642
Why, you little...!

08:23.145 --> 08:25.310
You strangle your child?

08:26.257 --> 08:28.090
Yeah, but... he's cool with it.

08:28.332 --> 08:28.818
Right?

08:29.738 --> 08:31.154
It hurts when I swallow.

08:31.198 --> 08:32.227
Why, you little....!

08:36.648 --> 08:41.510
Now, the doctor said a tour of the 
town could help bring back your memory.

08:42.635 --> 08:45.870
I say bing cherries are the most delicious!

08:46.075 --> 08:47.620
I say maraschino!

08:49.867 --> 08:51.683
Who are those freaks?

08:52.427 --> 08:56.580
Those "freaks,"as you call them, 
are some of our closest friends.

08:56.667 --> 08:59.611
Maraschino isn't even a kind of cherry!

08:59.717 --> 09:01.831
It's a way of preserving them!

09:02.207 --> 09:05.511
Sounds like duff man took the 
wrong side in this chicken fight.

09:05.745 --> 09:06.572
Oh, yeah!

09:08.686 --> 09:11.632
Why is that drug addict 
driving a school bus?

09:11.738 --> 09:15.581
I may be wasted, but I still care 
about the safety of these kids.

09:21.437 --> 09:23.091
See that ball of fire?

09:23.477 --> 09:24.902
That's the sun.

09:25.137 --> 09:26.652
It goes by many names.

09:27.157 --> 09:31.172
Apollo's lantern, day-moon, old blazey.

09:31.637 --> 09:34.793
The important thing is never to touch it.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.311
I know what the sun is!

09:37.445 --> 09:39.113
Yes, now you do.

09:43.088 --> 09:45.060
I know that sound!

09:45.885 --> 09:48.882
Maggie! My sweet little angel!

09:50.257 --> 09:53.502
The sound of the baby must have 
triggered a primal mnemonic response in

09:53.538 --> 09:54.502
mom's brain!

09:55.636 --> 09:58.283
Lisa! My little know-it-all!

09:58.398 --> 10:02.172
Hey, guys, guess who just 
became lactose-tolerant?

10:03.786 --> 10:06.531
Milhouse! You're Bart's best friend!

10:08.068 --> 10:09.913
I remember Bart!

10:10.626 --> 10:13.053
I can't believe you remembered 
me through Milhouse.

10:13.106 --> 10:14.580
He's not even my best friend.

10:14.715 --> 10:17.233
Who's got amnesia now, Bart?

10:20.055 --> 10:23.293
It's so great to have my children back.

10:23.378 --> 10:25.313
I better get ready. I'm next.

10:31.438 --> 10:34.942
All right, Marge, time to 
remember admiral awesome!

10:38.046 --> 10:41.411
Nope. I'm sorry, admiral, but 
you're still a stranger to me.

10:42.347 --> 10:44.401
Why do you remember them and not me?

10:44.578 --> 10:49.110
I don't know, maybe there'ssomething 
unpleasant blocking my memory of you.

10:49.157 --> 10:50.840
Hi-dilly ho, Simpsons!

10:51.015 --> 10:54.363
Oh, hey, ned. Isn't today your cat's birthday?

10:54.478 --> 10:56.770
I remember, 'cause she shares 
the date with Patty LaBelle.

11:03.418 --> 11:07.321
All it'll take to unlock your memories of
me is one of these blasts from the past.

11:07.518 --> 11:09.841
Here's me fighting with 
former president Bush.

11:10.147 --> 11:12.300
Me fighting with current president Bush.

11:12.397 --> 11:15.871
And here's me showing a bag of apples who's boss.

11:16.007 --> 11:22.570
I'm sorry, you seem like...a colorful 
character, but I just don't remember you.

11:22.766 --> 11:27.072
Well, maybe if we snuggle, it 
might rattle some memories loose.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.422
What's "snuggling"?

11:28.578 --> 11:34.492
When a man and a woman love each other 
very much, they usually get together...

11:35.245 --> 11:37.640
Mr. Simpson, I don't even know you!

11:37.738 --> 11:39.960
I'm not making love with you!

11:40.166 --> 11:42.293
But... what if we...

11:46.085 --> 11:48.572
You're describing how to parallel park.

11:50.457 --> 11:53.032
You used to love my non sequiturs.

11:54.727 --> 11:58.321
why can I remember everyone 
in town except my husband?

11:58.586 --> 12:02.882
Simple. Your brain is trying to save you
from your backed-up toilet of a marriage.

12:02.916 --> 12:06.052
Have you been talking like 
this for my entire marriage?

12:06.136 --> 12:07.600
Oh, no.

12:07.686 --> 12:10.191
No. We've always honored your choice.

12:11.046 --> 12:13.820
I don't know, I should give Homer a chance.

12:14.055 --> 12:16.522
But on the other hand, I feel nothing for him.

12:21.636 --> 12:23.221
This is horrible!

12:23.376 --> 12:24.513
We've got to tell dad.

12:25.425 --> 12:28.531
Oh, no! Bart and Lisa are gonna 
tell me something horrible!

12:29.998 --> 12:30.892
Ah...what?

12:31.096 --> 12:33.633
Buy the police department 
a hang glider, you said.

12:33.747 --> 12:35.821
Fight crime from above, you said.

12:36.036 --> 12:38.373
Yeah, and you said you're only 180 pounds.

12:38.448 --> 12:39.702
Shut  upand look for crime.

12:45.388 --> 12:46.710
Mr. Simpson?

12:46.915 --> 12:51.311
Marge, if I can't make you remember 
me, then I'll make you fall for me all

12:51.348 --> 12:52.121
over again.

12:52.376 --> 12:54.742
The heart is the symbol for love.

12:59.387 --> 13:04.431
That Homer Simpson he's quite a guy

13:04.488 --> 13:09.043
he paid me ten bucks so I would lie

13:09.087 --> 13:13.033
the truth is he's not so great

13:13.275 --> 13:18.242
he is the one man I truly hate.

13:18.427 --> 13:19.200
So beautiful.

13:19.455 --> 13:21.570
I wish I could understand italian.

13:23.755 --> 13:27.053
I've had a lovely evening, Mr. Simpson.

13:27.126 --> 13:30.791
Just wait, we'recoming to the site 
of our most romantic night ever.

13:33.185 --> 13:36.333
It was the plywood castle that we first...

13:36.736 --> 13:38.131
well, you know.

13:38.765 --> 13:39.711
Know what?

13:44.455 --> 13:49.202
No! I'm not the kind of girl who makes 
love on a putt-putt golf course!

13:49.317 --> 13:54.193
You loved it, especially when the 
windmill came around and whacked your butt.

13:56.298 --> 13:58.120
That sounds horrible!

13:58.215 --> 14:00.771
No. It was the happiest night of my life.

14:00.928 --> 14:05.180
The warm spring air, the swings 
I took in the batting cage afterwards.

14:05.358 --> 14:06.942
Don't you remember, darling?

14:07.045 --> 14:08.663
No, and I hope I never do!

14:08.768 --> 14:12.213
The best thing that ever happened 
to me was forgetting about you!

14:16.155 --> 14:20.233
You know, I still think about you all the time.

14:20.505 --> 14:21.790
Birthday's over, Seymour.

14:22.445 --> 14:22.752
But...

14:25.336 --> 14:28.461
I'm sorry you have to leave, but 
I just can't thinkof another way.

14:28.705 --> 14:29.213
I know.

14:29.745 --> 14:31.261
Wait, I thought of another way.

14:31.497 --> 14:32.251
I stay.

14:32.737 --> 14:34.202
Good-bye, Mr. Simpson.

14:35.716 --> 14:37.853
Dad, we don't want you to leave.

14:37.987 --> 14:39.880
My grades will suffer.

14:40.117 --> 14:41.790
In fact, they're already suffering.

14:41.928 --> 14:43.390
Look at this garden of "Fs."

14:43.595 --> 14:44.731
You planted them all.

14:45.088 --> 14:47.060
Marge, I realize you've made up your mind,

14:47.375 --> 14:49.583
and I want you to know that 
I deeply respect your...

14:50.197 --> 14:52.281
That works for hiccups, not amnesia.

14:52.426 --> 14:53.232
I know.

14:53.605 --> 14:54.780
I just thought maybe...

15:10.067 --> 15:12.190
How long you gonna be bunking with me, son?

15:12.368 --> 15:14.641
Well, the rest of your life for sure.

15:19.326 --> 15:21.592
Why are we having dinner in shelbyville?

15:21.945 --> 15:24.502
We found a place here that's 
serving up just what you need.

15:27.218 --> 15:31.302
A mixer? I don't know. I am 
still technically married.

15:31.508 --> 15:35.073
All we're saying is go in 
and chat with these guys.

15:35.275 --> 15:37.012
And if you want a quickie annulment

15:37.017 --> 15:40.053
and remarriage, we've got 
all the paperwork right here.

15:40.375 --> 15:42.111
Why don't you sign a bunch now.

15:42.318 --> 15:43.453
For fun.

15:44.498 --> 15:48.472
Welcome to speed dating, 
you exciting, lonely people.

15:48.665 --> 15:51.342
Every five minutes I'm going to blow this horn...

15:52.026 --> 15:54.712
And each man will move 
one table to his left.

15:55.367 --> 15:56.242
Excuse me.

15:56.568 --> 15:58.131
Is this how you met your husband?

15:58.555 --> 16:01.010
No, I met him through friends 
like a normal person.

16:01.307 --> 16:02.521
Now, speed date.

16:04.006 --> 16:07.620
I... I want you to know I'm 
coming from a very fragile place.

16:08.215 --> 16:09.240
My wife left me...

16:10.968 --> 16:12.012
Five years ago.

16:12.748 --> 16:14.131
That's so sad.

16:14.316 --> 16:16.370
Why did I kill her, why?

16:18.317 --> 16:19.222
Hello there.

16:19.535 --> 16:20.983
Yeah, hi. How you doing?

16:20.997 --> 16:22.323
So let's get right to it.

16:22.718 --> 16:25.250
I don't drive a lexus, okay?

16:25.417 --> 16:28.791
I don't have a lear jet or 
some big beach house in la-la land.

16:28.845 --> 16:31.660
I am just a nice man who makes a decent living.

16:31.728 --> 16:34.190
So I guess I should probably 
just go shoot myself?

16:36.828 --> 16:38.063
Don't get quiet on me.

16:38.188 --> 16:39.950
Please,  I hate when they get quiet.

16:41.507 --> 16:42.233
Ta-da!

16:42.376 --> 16:45.492
I know what you're thinking, but 
don't worry, I'm old enough to date.

16:46.365 --> 16:47.640
Dermabrasion.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.203
I think he's a male gay.

16:51.948 --> 16:54.712
I have to admit something, 
I feel a little silly.

16:54.878 --> 16:56.503
Oh, me, too.

16:56.725 --> 17:00.043
I can't believe anyone ever really 
finds anyone at these things.

17:00.165 --> 17:02.561
Yeah, I was dragged here 
by my older brothers.

17:02.916 --> 17:05.401
We used to be quintuplets, 
but three of us drowned.

17:09.935 --> 17:12.291
I really know where you're coming from.

17:13.605 --> 17:14.960
I guess we have to move on.

17:15.188 --> 17:16.352
Do we? We're adults.

17:16.375 --> 17:18.332
Why don't we just go get a cup of coffee?

17:18.435 --> 17:19.723
I'd love to.

17:26.265 --> 17:27.290
I smell romance.

17:27.778 --> 17:29.271
It's a perfect night for love.

17:29.695 --> 17:32.622
Would you pretty ladies care 
to join us for some champagne?

17:32.787 --> 17:35.012
Go suck a rat, Assanova.

17:42.445 --> 17:43.421
That might be Marge.

17:43.956 --> 17:45.201
Don't answer it.

17:45.466 --> 17:46.710
Savor the sound.

17:47.625 --> 17:48.570
Boy...

17:53.955 --> 17:54.591
Marge?

17:54.816 --> 17:57.170
Homer, I don't wantto alarm 
you, but right now

17:57.186 --> 18:00.873
we're looking at your wife yukkin' 
it up with a good-looking guy.

18:01.048 --> 18:03.441
He just touched her arm and 
now they're being quiet.

18:03.648 --> 18:06.163
But it's not an awkward silence.

18:06.375 --> 18:09.491
Yeah, it's more like a nothing 
needs to be said kind of silence.

18:15.935 --> 18:19.842
I just think the best thing a person 
can do for the world is to be clean and 

18:19.918 --> 18:20.290
polite.

18:20.508 --> 18:23.250
Wow, that's what I would have said.

18:23.496 --> 18:27.691
Well, I would have said polite 
and clean, but wow, still.

18:27.865 --> 18:31.750
Oh, no! He's Marge's and my dream man.

18:32.157 --> 18:34.541
I've got to make a play for her 
now or I might lose her forever.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.020
At least she found someone 
who can make her happy.

18:43.165 --> 18:46.703
Marge, I feel like the two of 
us can say anything to each other.

18:46.905 --> 18:48.211
You really mean that?

18:48.438 --> 18:48.850
 I do.

18:50.505 --> 18:52.571
I've got amnesia and I have three kids.

18:54.088 --> 18:58.963
Wow. My first thought is respect, 
both for your mental illness

18:59.026 --> 19:00.693
and your ability to get back into shape.

19:01.056 --> 19:03.292
My second thought is good-bye.

19:07.306 --> 19:08.671
You idiot!

19:09.337 --> 19:11.030
Do you know what you just gave up?

19:11.107 --> 19:12.012
Who the hell are you?

19:12.566 --> 19:15.511
The wisest, wettest man you'll ever meet.

19:16.766 --> 19:17.331
Go on.

19:17.515 --> 19:20.793
You just walked away from the sweetest 
most beautiful woman a guy could 

19:20.797 --> 19:21.183
want.

19:21.456 --> 19:25.352
In ten years, she never had the 
last slice of pizza and she's never 

19:25.396 --> 19:26.013
complained.

19:26.327 --> 19:30.191
Every election she wishes she could 
vote for both guys because they both

19:30.297 --> 19:30.901
seem nice.

19:31.267 --> 19:34.812
And there's a light inside her that 
makes everyone else look better.

19:35.177 --> 19:37.030
And you blew her off.

19:37.236 --> 19:39.453
Dude, she's got three kids.

19:39.735 --> 19:41.411
I... really?

19:41.815 --> 19:43.040
Well, she's still great.

19:49.867 --> 19:50.812
Mr. Simpson...

19:54.385 --> 19:58.041
I may not know much about you, but you 
sure know a lot of wonderful things 

19:58.045 --> 19:58.741
about me.

19:59.025 --> 20:00.772
And that means a lot to a woman.

20:00.977 --> 20:02.492
I still don't remember you.

20:02.706 --> 20:07.680
But for the first time since 
this happened, I wish I did... Homer.

20:12.988 --> 20:14.761
I'm so happy we're together again.

20:15.027 --> 20:15.651
Want to get a drink?

20:15.968 --> 20:16.662
You drink?

20:17.577 --> 20:19.941
Yeah, I started when you 
were in the hospital.

20:20.317 --> 20:21.303
I was so worried.

20:21.566 --> 20:24.302
Recently I tried this thing called beer, and...

20:24.316 --> 20:27.190
I remember everything!

20:27.365 --> 20:30.032
You get drunk all the time.

20:31.486 --> 20:33.580
But you also remember 
that you're an enabler?

20:33.818 --> 20:35.961
Of course I do.

20:36.047 --> 20:38.071
That's why we're such a great team.

20:43.318 --> 20:45.573
You've been drinking today, haven't you?

20:45.927 --> 20:48.922
I sure have, partner.
