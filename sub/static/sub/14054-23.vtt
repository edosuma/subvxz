- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- How could he do it?

00:04.600 --> 00:06.830
- Lf Marissa found out...
- No, she cannot find out. 

00:07.000 --> 00:08.399
You have sex with Julie today?

00:08.560 --> 00:10.039
- We've got a connection.
- It's gonna end.

00:10.200 --> 00:11.474
Oh, my God. That's Hailey.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.518
- My mom's gonna freak.
- So don't tell her. Not that she'd care.

00:14.680 --> 00:17.558
- She would if she knew.
- They found Hailey working as a stripper.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.153
- So you wanna come home?
- Yeah.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.915
You're dead! Don't ever come home.
You hear me?

00:23.080 --> 00:25.071
- It never could've worked.
- You're breaking up with me?

00:25.240 --> 00:27.071
I'm done having sex with Julie Cooper.

00:27.240 --> 00:29.356
- Marissa.
- I've gotta go.

00:34.840 --> 00:36.751
Think. Where else could she be?

00:36.920 --> 00:41.357
I don't know, man.
We've been all over town. Twice.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.875
I'm sorry, I just don't know
what to do at this point.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.713
We're not giving up.
We just gotta figure this thing out.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.598
All right, when she left she was upset.

00:48.760 --> 00:51.513
So she probably went somewhere
she would feel safe, right?

00:51.680 --> 00:54.513
Yeah, well, somewhere no one's even
gonna think to look for her.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.990
- Including us, apparently.
- Well, maybe she called. Where's Cohen?

00:58.160 --> 01:00.754
Yeah. Maybe she called,
and he went after her.

01:00.920 --> 01:03.480
Maybe he's asleep. Hey, Cohen.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.949
- Get up.
- It's my precious. You can't have it.

01:07.280 --> 01:10.033
- Hey, what's wrong?
- You were asleep, that's what's wrong.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.555
- I was adjusting my back.
- Did Marissa call?

01:12.720 --> 01:15.632
I would've heard the phone even
if I was sleeping, which I wasn't.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.233
I was adjusting my back.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.960
There's a missed call, though,
which is weird... Okay.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.953
Meanwhile, Ryan and I are driving
around all night like idiots.

01:23.120 --> 01:25.953
Well, none of this would've happened
if it wasn't for you, so...

01:26.120 --> 01:27.599
Shut up. It was an accident.

01:27.760 --> 01:31.275
Did you accidentally sleep with Marissa's
mom or accidentally tell Marissa?

01:31.440 --> 01:34.079
- I'm in no mood.
- Keep it in your boardshorts next time.

01:34.240 --> 01:35.958
That was her.

01:36.120 --> 01:37.314
- What'd she say?
- Not much.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.710
Just that she's okay.
And not to try to follow her.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.677
Where is she?

01:41.840 --> 01:44.673
- She's not here.
- Why don't I believe you?

01:44.840 --> 01:46.193
Luke.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.511
What's going on in here?

01:51.920 --> 01:53.956
Marissa took off
when we got back from L.A.

01:54.120 --> 01:56.270
- She ran away.
- Why? What did you do to her?

01:56.440 --> 01:58.112
- I didn't do anything, you did.
- What?

01:58.280 --> 02:00.111
- They know.
- Shut up, Luke.

02:00.600 --> 02:03.034
They saw us outside the motel.

02:03.480 --> 02:04.708
Marissa knows too.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.276
Will you boys excuse us, please?
Ryan and I need to have a talk.

02:22.240 --> 02:25.073
- Whatever you think you know about me...
- I don't care about you.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.993
I just wanna get her back home safe.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.557
- You really don't know where she is?
- I know she's okay.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.280
She left a message
saying not to look for her.

02:36.440 --> 02:40.911
So, what am I supposed to do?
Last time she took off, she almost died.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.308
I'm gonna call the police.

02:42.480 --> 02:45.438
Yeah, what are you gonna tell them
when they ask why she left?

02:46.320 --> 02:49.835
- I have to at least call her doctors.
- So you can have her locked up again?

02:50.000 --> 02:53.879
If that's what it takes, yes. I will not
have her hurting herself anymore.

02:54.040 --> 02:57.635
Maybe you should've thought of that
before you slept with her ex-boyfriend.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.792
I would love to stay
and chat with you, Ryan...

03:00.960 --> 03:03.554
...but I have to find my daughter.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.192
Not if I find her first.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.879
- So, what's the GP, RA?
- I have no idea what you just said.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.268
Game plan, Ryan Atwood.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.237
- Just using initials now?
- They save time.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.231
- Not if you have to translate them.
- GP.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.594
- Game plan?
- Good point.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.320
You gonna ride around Newport
looking for Marissa's car...

03:58.480 --> 04:00.914
...while I go talk to Summer?
- You have a better idea?

04:01.080 --> 04:03.878
Not yet. But maybe
after a nice, healthy...

04:04.880 --> 04:06.836
...massively over-the-top breakfast.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.198
Hey, guys. We've got eggs, waffles,
three different kinds of pancakes.

04:11.360 --> 04:14.557
- Wow, Hailey, what's the occasion?
- I was in rough shape last night.

04:14.720 --> 04:17.837
I didn't get a chance to thank you guys
for convincing me to come home.

04:18.120 --> 04:20.076
So, hungry?

04:20.240 --> 04:23.073
- Yeah.
- Oh, my... What is going on here?

04:23.240 --> 04:26.710
Mom, Hailey made three different kinds
of pancakes and waffles.

04:26.880 --> 04:29.952
They're deliciously redundant.
Have a blueberry, they're good.

04:30.120 --> 04:33.510
Coffee? Here, have a seat.
Let me just get this out of your way.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.592
Hailey. The want ads already?

04:36.760 --> 04:38.273
Yeah, it's mostly restaurant gigs.

04:38.440 --> 04:41.398
But it's not like I have any other
marketable skills, so...

04:41.560 --> 04:45.235
I know of a hostess position available.
A speakeasy I call The Balboa Lighthouse.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.631
That's a good idea, except you have
to ask Sandy when he's in a good mood.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.030
We have to get all the bread
out of the house.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.633
Now's not really a good time.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.155
Hailey made three different
kinds of pancakes.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.392
Enjoy them now. We only have
two hours to unleaven the entire kitchen.

04:58.560 --> 05:01.074
- What does that mean?
- My mother's plane lands at noon.

05:01.240 --> 05:05.199
If she sees us eating pancakes on the
first day of Passover, she'll <i>plotz</i>.

05:05.360 --> 05:08.477
I love when the nana comes,
and Dad's all Jewish again. I have to go.

05:08.640 --> 05:12.076
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah, I should probably get dressed.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.196
Honey, do we have any brisket?

05:15.360 --> 05:19.273
The Ackermans are looking after the
food for the Seder. We're bringing wine.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.749
Right. Except we're not going
to the Ackermans'.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.798
- Since when?
- Since I told Ma we're having Seder here.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.712
- You what?
- Which, if she asks...

05:26.880 --> 05:30.350
...is something we do every year.
I also told her you converted.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.034
I'm kidding.
About the conversion part.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.114
Honey, you're not gonna have
to lift a finger. I'll shop.

05:36.280 --> 05:41.070
She'll cook. The kids will help. Hailey and
Jimmy'll be here. Ryan can invite Marissa.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.196
- Seth can invite Summer.
- What am I gonna do?

05:43.360 --> 05:45.920
Sit back and let your mother
take over the entire house?

05:46.080 --> 05:49.868
She was gonna do it anyway. At least
this way, we get a decent meal out of...

05:50.040 --> 05:51.758
- Are you done with these?
- Sandy, don't.

05:53.840 --> 05:56.718
We don't know where she is,
but she called to say she's okay.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.313
I know, she called me too.

05:58.480 --> 06:01.233
- What? Summer, why didn't you tell me?
- She told me not to.

06:01.400 --> 06:04.119
- Summer, if you know where she is...
- I don't. I swear.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.191
She's gonna be fine.
She just needs time.

06:06.360 --> 06:09.238
Me and Ryan don't have time.
My nana gets into town in an hour.

06:09.400 --> 06:12.437
Wait, your nana? That is so sweet.
I wanna meet the nana.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.830
- You really don't, believe me.
- I love old people.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.673
- They're so cute.
- Yeah, well, the nana, not so cute.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.876
- Really, she's ugly?
- No, she's just scary.

06:20.040 --> 06:23.157
- I can be scary too. I think I can take it.
- Yeah, I don't think I can.

06:23.320 --> 06:26.790
The nana's very judgmental,
and she's political and opinionated.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.475
Right. And I'm dumb and shallow
and have no opinion whatsoever.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.437
- I didn't say that.
- Not out loud.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.433
- You're ashamed of me.
- That's not true. Okay?

06:35.600 --> 06:37.636
I'm not ashamed of you, Summer.
I'm protective.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.791
You're gonna thank me for this,
I promise.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.678
- I have to go.
- Where are you going?

06:41.840 --> 06:43.751
I have to pick up some stuff
for the Seder.

06:43.920 --> 06:46.514
- The what, now?
- The Seder, for Passover.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.676
Yeah, you're not meeting the nana.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.635
Sandy, what are you doing?
Rosa just put those on.

06:55.800 --> 06:58.917
Yeah, I know. But I thought maybe
these sheets were a little too fancy.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.719
They are fancy.
They're 700 thread-count Pratesi sheets.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.030
- I don't want her to know that.
- How would she know?

07:04.400 --> 07:06.038
- She might check.
- Why would she care?

07:06.200 --> 07:09.351
She's a social worker in the Bronx
and has been for 40 years.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.353
Whatever little bit of extra money
she can scrape together...

07:12.520 --> 07:15.318
...she gives it to the ACLU
or Franklin Armory Women's Shelter.

07:15.480 --> 07:18.552
- She's not out buying fancy sheets.
- Technically, I bought the sheets.

07:18.720 --> 07:21.871
You with your sheets, and me,
I've left the public defender's office...

07:22.040 --> 07:25.112
...so I can make a ton of money
and open my own restaurant.

07:25.280 --> 07:27.316
- I think they call that success.
- No.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.914
Not according to Sophie Cohen
and not even Sandy Cohen.

07:30.080 --> 07:33.709
You know why she's coming out here.
It's not for a visit, not for a holiday. No.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.757
She's staging an intervention.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.831
To put me back on the path
to righteousness.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.912
- Or, in Mother's case, self-righteousness.
- That's not true.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.150
- No?
- Your mother just wants you to be happy.

07:43.320 --> 07:44.912
No, she doesn't believe in happy.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.753
If you're happy,
you're not working hard enough.

07:47.920 --> 07:51.549
I know where Rosa keeps the sheets
that don't feel so fancy.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.960
- Hey.
- Hey. I was headed to the restaurant...

08:00.120 --> 08:03.954
...and I thought I'd visit, see how you're
doing after our big adventure last night.

08:04.120 --> 08:07.271
- You okay?
- Yeah. Just embarrassed mostly.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.397
Embarrassed? Why? Come on.

08:09.560 --> 08:10.993
You found me at a strip club.

08:11.160 --> 08:14.755
Hey, there is nothing wrong
with a good strip club.

08:15.960 --> 08:20.112
Not that I would know or anything,
because I, you know, just...

08:20.880 --> 08:23.633
- I wouldn't know.
- No, right, of course not.

08:24.760 --> 08:28.116
So, what are you gonna do? You gonna
go back to L.A.? You gonna stay here?

08:29.720 --> 08:31.472
What do you think I should do?

08:31.640 --> 08:33.596
Well, it's not my decision...

08:33.760 --> 08:38.674
...but you've got family and a place
to stay and people who care about you.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.832
Yeah?

08:41.760 --> 08:42.953
Yeah.

08:43.960 --> 08:46.713
So if I were to stay...

08:47.120 --> 08:49.236
...would that mean that...?
- Hailey.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.548
Be right there.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.869
- You wanna come in?
- No, I gotta go back to work.

08:57.240 --> 08:59.800
- Will I see you later?
- Well...

08:59.960 --> 09:02.428
- You gonna be around?
- Sure.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.797
- Well, then I'll see you later.
- All right, then.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.716
Hi. You guys want some help?

09:12.880 --> 09:15.189
- Thanks, Ryan.
- No, they're fine, man. Have a seat.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.918
Any luck?

09:17.360 --> 09:19.920
I looked everywhere.
The house, the restaurant, the beach.

09:20.080 --> 09:21.672
- Yeah? We'll find her.
- All right.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.275
Who's coming with me to the airport?

09:25.920 --> 09:28.593
Come on. Seth.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.995
Ryan, come on.

09:34.680 --> 09:35.874
Anybody?

09:38.000 --> 09:41.037
You're not ready for the nana?
No one's ever ready for the nana.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.553
That woman is scary.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.073
Hello?

09:45.760 --> 09:47.716
- It couldn't be.
- The front door's wide open.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.678
A person could walk in here,
take everything and kill us all.

09:52.520 --> 09:55.637
It is. It's the nana.

09:56.520 --> 09:59.956
Ma, what are you doing here?
I was just coming to get you.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.680
Well, you would've been very late.
I'm kidding.

10:02.840 --> 10:05.354
The plane was early.
I took a taxi to surprise you.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.511
Are you surprised? You look surprised.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.398
- I'm surprised.
- Sweetheart.

10:09.880 --> 10:12.269
Hello, Kirsten. Look at you.

10:12.440 --> 10:17.389
So beautiful with the hair and the nails.
Those classic features.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.556
And there's my grandson.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.119
Who never writes, never calls...

10:22.280 --> 10:25.670
...because he's too busy
being chased by the California girls.

10:26.200 --> 10:29.875
- How are you, Setheleh?
- How are you, Nana?

10:30.040 --> 10:32.600
You must be Ryan.
I'm very happy to meet you.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.792
- Welcome to the family.
- Thank you.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.791
- Thank you.
- You, I don't know.

10:38.360 --> 10:40.828
Sophie, you remember my sister, Hailey.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.116
Oh, right. The bad seed.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.390
I always liked you best.
Don't tell the others.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.589
Look at this house.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.195
And this yard.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.275
And that view of the ocean.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.516
I'm sorry, but I just gotta say it.

11:01.400 --> 11:04.073
- Here it comes.
- California.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.188
Not so terrible.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.958
All right. Where else could she be?

11:11.120 --> 11:13.190
I don't know exactly
who that woman was, Ryan...

11:13.360 --> 11:15.316
...but that was not the nana.
- She was nice.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.471
She was nice, Ryan.
That's the problem, okay?

11:17.640 --> 11:19.790
The nana's not nice.
I love her, but she's not.

11:19.960 --> 11:23.430
- Who haven't we thought of?
- I hate to say it, but what about Oliver?

11:23.600 --> 11:25.716
I talked to the hotel.
He's in the hospital.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.350
She was even nice to my mom, Ryan.

11:28.520 --> 11:30.590
The nana has never
exactly cared for the Kirsten.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.432
- Really?
- Yeah. Are you kidding me?

11:32.600 --> 11:34.716
She's the Green Arrow
to my mom's Hawkman.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.752
The Wolverine to her Cyclops, dude.

11:36.920 --> 11:41.357
Two people who have nothing in common
suddenly getting along. It's not right.

11:41.520 --> 11:43.158
It's just not natural.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.518
I know where she is.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.071
- Took you long enough.
- Is she here?

11:58.240 --> 11:59.958
Yeah. She won't be happy to see you.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.078
How is she? Is she okay?
I can't believe she came here.

12:03.240 --> 12:05.151
- I was surprised too.
- You should've called.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.880
- I couldn't. She asked me not to.
- Her mom's freaking out.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.759
She's about to call the cops,
so I better just get her and go.

12:10.920 --> 12:14.037
What the hell is he doing here?
Did you call him?

12:14.200 --> 12:15.872
- No.
- This is unbelievable.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.110
So he just shows up on the day of?

12:18.280 --> 12:20.999
You just stay the hell away
from me, okay?

12:22.440 --> 12:23.793
Excuse me.

12:24.360 --> 12:25.554
Day of? Day of what?

12:26.440 --> 12:28.237
Our engagement party.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.517
- Everybody finished?
- Thanks.

12:32.680 --> 12:36.275
Sophie, is there something special
that you'd like Hailey to pick up for you?

12:36.440 --> 12:40.319
No, sweetheart, I'm sure that whatever
you kids do every year will be just perfect.

12:40.480 --> 12:43.597
We were kind of hoping we could
talk you into the Sophie Cohen special.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.354
- The brisket, the macaroons.
- I don't do macaroons anymore.

12:46.520 --> 12:49.239
- Come on, Ma. It's Ryan's first Seder.
- How do you know that?

12:49.400 --> 12:52.597
They have Jews in Chino. Why do you
think they want a P.F. Chang's?

12:52.760 --> 12:55.832
I like that he goes back to the old
neighborhood. Speaking of which...

12:56.000 --> 12:58.434
...guess who asked about you recently.
Sean Sullivan.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.160
- Sully.
- He and your dad were in a gang together.

13:01.320 --> 13:03.709
- Did you know that?
- Yeah? Bloods or Crips, Father?

13:03.880 --> 13:06.110
- It was a youth group.
- After his father left us...

13:06.280 --> 13:10.114
...I had to work so much, he was pretty
much raised by the entire neighborhood.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.231
Yeah, well, somebody had to do it.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.669
Well, when am I gonna see
your new restaurant?

13:19.840 --> 13:22.877
- You want to?
- What did I just say?

13:23.040 --> 13:27.033
I'll just go freshen up
and then we can go, huh?

13:31.440 --> 13:33.192
- Who is that woman?
- Not the nana.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.112
Come on, guys.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.999
Maybe she's changed.
Maybe she's mellowed.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.958
Maybe she's genuinely happy to be here.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.475
- Yeah, something's up.
- I'm gonna find out what it is.

13:43.640 --> 13:46.837
Sandy, don't.
Whatever that woman is, I love her.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.230
She's sweet, she's kind, she's helpful.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.476
I'll get it.

13:52.640 --> 13:55.438
I'm begging you, leave it alone.

13:57.160 --> 13:59.799
- Hello. May I help you, dear?
- Hi.

13:59.960 --> 14:02.474
You must be the nana.
I'm Summer. Shalom.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.915
Oh, well, hello.
Are you a friend of Seth's?

14:05.080 --> 14:07.116
- Well, as a matter of fact, I'm his...
- Summer.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.236
Hey. What are you doing here, buddy?

14:10.040 --> 14:12.873
I was in the neighborhood and
thought I'd bring macaroons by...

14:13.040 --> 14:15.508
...for the Seder tonight.
- Oh, how sweet, Summer.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.797
- You shouldn't have.
- Really, you shouldn't have. Okay.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.269
- So are you two...?
- Yes, we are.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.271
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.796
Wonderful. Then you'll be here tonight,
yes? You can ask the Four Questions.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.598
Thank you, nana, I'd love to.

14:28.760 --> 14:31.149
I was just getting my Haggadah
to get copies made.

14:31.320 --> 14:34.312
Oh, no, I can do that for you.
I love a good Haggadah.

14:34.480 --> 14:37.836
You know, it's the prayer book
containing the Seder ritual.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.834
Somebody knows her stuff, huh?
Seth Cohen, you're a very lucky man.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.272
Thanks.

14:45.720 --> 14:49.429
- Listen. Wow.
- She's not scary. You're the scary one.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.477
You're scary with the hitting
and cookies.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.518
Are you afraid I'll embarrass you
in front of the nana? I'm not.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.672
I'm gonna study this thing so hard,
I'm even gonna out-Jew you.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.270
You're reading it backwards.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.117
Thanks for the cookies.

15:14.560 --> 15:15.993
Wow.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.117
So when's the wedding?

15:21.080 --> 15:22.559
June.

15:24.080 --> 15:27.072
- I wanted to call you and tell you.
- Yeah?

15:28.400 --> 15:31.472
- I thought you didn't want this.
- He really loves me, Ryan.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.319
How do you feel about him?

15:34.480 --> 15:37.711
You don't get to show up the day of
my party and ask questions like this.

15:37.880 --> 15:39.677
It's not like I knew this was happening.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.432
- I knew you'd be this way.
- What way?

15:41.600 --> 15:43.795
You ran away to Newport
to get away from him.

15:43.960 --> 15:45.996
Yeah, like when you left Chino?

15:46.160 --> 15:48.276
Ryan, you made it.
You see, Theresa?

15:48.440 --> 15:51.113
I told you he'd come if we invited him.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.874
- Yeah, Mom, he didn't come for the party.
- No?

15:54.040 --> 15:55.678
He came for me.

15:55.840 --> 15:58.513
- Hey.
- You promised you wouldn't call him.

15:58.680 --> 16:00.591
- She didn't.
- Then why are you here?

16:00.760 --> 16:02.830
I'm here to make sure you're okay.
Get you home.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.356
Then you wasted your time,
because I'm not going anywhere.

16:13.680 --> 16:15.989
Hey. What's all this?

16:16.160 --> 16:20.472
Pasta, cookies, cupcakes,
in all their leavened goodness.

16:20.640 --> 16:24.553
And an invitation to Seder dinner
tonight. All courtesy of...

16:24.720 --> 16:26.631
...the Nana Cohen.
- Wow.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.917
- Today is my lucky day.
- You have no idea.

16:33.680 --> 16:37.036
Look, Hailey, we can't...
We can't do this.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.513
But I thought when you showed up
at the house this morning...

16:40.680 --> 16:43.797
...when you came to L. A to find me...
- I was worried about you...

16:43.960 --> 16:47.316
...and wanted to be sure you were okay.
- I can't believe this.

16:47.480 --> 16:49.436
Kirsten's my best friend.
Sandy's my partner.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.909
- This restaurant is all I have.
- What are you doing?

16:52.080 --> 16:54.196
Showing up at the house?
Showing up in L.A.?

16:54.360 --> 16:57.670
Telling me how much you care
about me? You don't care about me.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.432
- Of course I care about you.
- Right.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.478
Just not as much as
Sandy and Kirsten and the restaurant.

17:02.640 --> 17:05.074
- Wait.
- For what?

17:08.839 --> 17:10.830
I'll see you, Jimmy.

17:14.480 --> 17:17.074
Marissa, come on.
Everybody's worried about you.

17:17.240 --> 17:19.595
- Who? Luke? My mom?
- That's over now.

17:19.760 --> 17:23.673
Maybe for them, but I still have to live
with it. I just don't have to live there.

17:23.839 --> 17:27.310
- You can't hide out in Chino forever.
- Maybe not, but I can for right now.

17:28.840 --> 17:32.310
Theresa said I can stay in Arturo's room,
and that she'd help me find a job...

17:32.480 --> 17:36.109
...until I can save enough money...
- To what? Run away?

17:36.560 --> 17:38.710
Your mom's already threatening
to call the cops.

17:38.880 --> 17:41.189
- And your doctors...
- So, what am I supposed to do?

17:41.360 --> 17:43.828
- I can't go back there.
- I'm not going back without you.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.956
Then I guess you're not going back.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.395
I wish the floors had been finished
before you saw the place.

17:51.560 --> 17:54.757
- The floors were fine.
- How was the restaurant tour?

17:54.920 --> 17:57.673
- It was nice.
- It was nice? That's all I get? It was nice?

17:57.840 --> 17:59.478
It was very nice.

17:59.640 --> 18:02.712
- What? What do you want me to say?
- Ma, what do you wanna say, really?

18:03.200 --> 18:06.749
Come on, this Jewish Mary Poppins act,
I'm not buying it.

18:07.360 --> 18:10.796
- What are you doing here, really?
- You invited me.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.916
I've invited you every year
since Seth was 13.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.514
I've been working.
You know what my caseload is like.

18:15.680 --> 18:19.116
That's why I left the PD's office.
So I could spend more time at home.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.759
That's not why you left, Sandy.

18:20.920 --> 18:24.117
And I have more time and resources
to help the people in the community.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.316
You're not helping,
you're opening restaurants.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.436
- That's not true.
- Who's talking to you?

18:28.600 --> 18:30.556
Do not speak to her like that
in this house.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.073
I'm sorry.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.518
But you know what?

18:36.040 --> 18:38.315
You won't have to
put up with it much longer.

18:38.480 --> 18:41.790
There she is. She's coming back.
The Sophie Cohen we all know and love.

18:42.680 --> 18:46.036
Think it's funny? You'll see
how funny it is when I'm dead.

18:46.200 --> 18:49.556
You're kidding.
You're gonna outlive us all, out of spite.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.678
Well, Dr. Talley disagrees with you.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.071
He gives me four to six months, tops.

18:57.120 --> 18:59.076
He says I have advanced lung cancer.

19:00.520 --> 19:02.670
You wanna know why I came?

19:03.280 --> 19:05.635
I came to say goodbye.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.951
- Why are you still here?
- Look, man...

19:31.120 --> 19:33.588
I ask Theresa to marry me,
and she goes and finds you.

19:33.760 --> 19:37.116
We work everything out and on the day
of our engagement party, you show up.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.271
- I'm here for Marissa.
- She doesn't want you here.

19:39.440 --> 19:42.671
And I sure as hell don't want you here.
You understand?

19:42.840 --> 19:44.990
Look, it's my engagement party, okay?

19:45.160 --> 19:48.072
I'm going to get a drink,
when I come back, don't be here.

19:48.240 --> 19:50.151
- I'm not leaving without her.
- Yes, you are.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.515
- Look, you don't wanna do this.
- No, you don't wanna.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.318
He told you to go. Now, go.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.430
- Hello?
- Did you just call me?

20:07.600 --> 20:09.511
- <i>Yeah, but</i>...
- Well, where is she?

20:09.680 --> 20:12.433
- I'm not telling you that.
- Don't make me call the police.

20:12.600 --> 20:15.433
I would hate to tell them
you're holding her against her will.

20:15.600 --> 20:18.672
- You wouldn't do that.
- Just get her home, now.

20:28.080 --> 20:31.277
Ma, please, come on. Sit down.
We have to talk about this.

20:31.440 --> 20:34.432
No, we don't. What we have to do
is put this brisket in the oven...

20:34.600 --> 20:38.479
...or we'll be eating at midnight.
- I'll get that for you.

20:41.480 --> 20:45.029
Thank you, doll. Sandy said
you were a lox in the kitchen.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.760
- Don't change the subject.
- There is no subject.

20:47.920 --> 20:50.798
- I'm not talking, I'm cooking.
- You can't drop a bomb like that...

20:50.960 --> 20:52.916
...and not talk about it.
Why tell me then?

20:53.080 --> 20:56.072
I didn't want to. You kept hocking me.
It slipped out.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.518
- Have you told anybody else?
- No.

20:58.680 --> 21:02.309
Not your sister. Not your brother. And
don't tell anyone either, especially Seth.

21:02.480 --> 21:05.358
- Why not? He deserves to know.
- Because it's my business.

21:05.520 --> 21:06.919
I will tell him when I'm ready.

21:07.080 --> 21:10.038
Now, he's coming back here
with Summer any minute, so...

21:10.200 --> 21:13.192
Well, what about the treatment?
What did Dr. Talley recommend?

21:13.360 --> 21:17.035
- The surgery? The chemo? What?
- Sure, but what's the point?

21:17.200 --> 21:21.113
By the time I saw Talley,
it had already spread...

21:21.280 --> 21:23.111
...so that's that.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.235
- So, what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna make dinner.

21:29.400 --> 21:32.437
I'm gonna enjoy what's left of my life,
and I hope you'll do the same.

21:32.600 --> 21:35.956
- I want you to see a doctor out here.
- Well, that's not gonna happen.

21:36.120 --> 21:40.318
We have an incredible oncologist.
When my mother had ovarian cancer...

21:40.480 --> 21:42.630
She had the treatment? The chemo?

21:43.080 --> 21:45.355
With the hair loss and the nausea?

21:46.160 --> 21:48.958
- Did it work?
- No.

21:49.920 --> 21:53.356
But we had a chance
to spend more time with her.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.636
- You wanna spend more time with me?
- Yeah.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.872
You left home when you were 16
and moved clear across the country.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.838
I had a scholarship and a chance
to make something of myself.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.991
You married a woman
whose father represents...

22:04.160 --> 22:06.674
...everything I have fought against
my entire life.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.718
I didn't marry her because of
her father's politics or principles.

22:09.880 --> 22:13.395
Oh, what politics? What principles?
Oh, God, what am I doing here?!

22:13.560 --> 22:16.279
I hate this state! I hate the sunshine!
I hate the ocean!

22:16.440 --> 22:18.510
I hate Schwarzenegger!

22:24.080 --> 22:26.036
- Come in.
- Hey.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.791
- You look...
- It's Theresa's.

22:32.320 --> 22:35.392
- What happened to your arm?
- It's just a scratch.

22:35.560 --> 22:37.596
Eddie and his guys
don't really want me around.

22:37.760 --> 22:41.355
- I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.
- It's okay. We just need to leave.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.556
We need to get some alcohol
and clean this arm.

22:43.720 --> 22:46.188
No, look, it's fine.
We can just deal with this later.

22:46.360 --> 22:49.397
We're not going anywhere.
So just get the phone. I'll talk to Eddie.

22:49.600 --> 22:52.592
No, look, I...
You don't wanna...

22:57.880 --> 22:59.598
- Hello?
- Hey. Come home right now.

22:59.840 --> 23:02.354
- What's going on?
- I don't know. The nana's scary again.

23:02.520 --> 23:05.478
Mom and Dad keep asking when
you're coming home, and I'm at a loss.

23:05.640 --> 23:07.471
- Is Marissa okay?
- How's Marissa doing?

23:07.640 --> 23:10.313
She won't leave. So now
Eddie's threatening to kick my ass...

23:10.480 --> 23:12.311
...and Julie's threatening
to have me arrested.

23:12.480 --> 23:16.189
Why is this night different
from all other nights?

23:16.360 --> 23:17.952
Okay, just come home, man.

23:18.120 --> 23:20.475
You said it yourself,
Marissa's fine, all right?

23:20.640 --> 23:22.870
<i>There's nothing more to do.</i>
<i>It's her mom's problem.</i>

23:23.040 --> 23:25.873
- I can't just leave her here.
- You can't stay, either. Please.

23:26.040 --> 23:28.554
- We have the nana happening.
- For on all other nights...

23:28.760 --> 23:32.469
...we eat either "chamitz" or "matzah."
- Chametz or matzo.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.392
- Look, I'll try, but...
- <i>No. No trying.</i>

23:34.560 --> 23:37.438
Come home. Now. I have to go.
Summer's having a Hebrew hernia.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.999
<i>Cohen.</i>

23:43.160 --> 23:44.752
Luke.

23:45.360 --> 23:47.635
You can't be here.
Kaitlin's in the kitchen.

23:47.800 --> 23:49.916
I know, I know.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.877
It is not your fault, okay?
I'm the grownup here.

23:54.040 --> 23:57.396
I'm the one who should know better.
I'm the one who's lost her daughter.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.516
You're not really gonna
lock her up, are you?

23:59.800 --> 24:01.552
Honestly, I don't know what else to do.

24:01.760 --> 24:04.911
She's a kid, Luke.
She's run away again.

24:05.080 --> 24:07.150
And if she doesn't come back
on her own...

24:07.920 --> 24:10.229
...what other choice do I have?

24:10.400 --> 24:12.436
I need her to be safe.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.556
You gotta be kidding me.

24:24.960 --> 24:29.317
Darling, the only nice thing about having
cancer is that I can smoke all I want.

24:29.480 --> 24:31.835
Try not to ruin it for me.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.471
I called Dr. Talley.

24:42.640 --> 24:44.551
Please tell me you did not do that.

24:45.080 --> 24:47.913
- He says you haven't returned his calls.
- Well, I've been busy.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.719
And while he says there's no cure,
you can slow it down...

24:50.880 --> 24:53.872
...if you take the chemo and radiation.
- And slow me down too.

24:54.040 --> 24:56.349
- Might not be such a bad thing.
- Sandy.

24:56.520 --> 24:58.795
I have kids in the Bronx
who are counting on me.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.793
You got kids of your own who
are counting on you. And grandkids.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.110
Oh, please.
Counting on me for what?

25:04.280 --> 25:06.840
To be there. That's all.

25:09.080 --> 25:12.675
- That's all I ever wanted.
- You're gonna start with me again?

25:12.840 --> 25:15.957
When I left home at 16,
I was surprised you noticed.

25:16.120 --> 25:19.795
That's nice. That's what a mother wants
to hear. Especially when she's dying.

25:24.480 --> 25:25.708
Please, continue.

25:27.040 --> 25:29.270
You were never home.
You were working all the time.

25:29.440 --> 25:32.955
You were taking care of other
people's kids, or marching for causes...

25:33.120 --> 25:36.476
...or circulating petitions,
or picketing city hall.

25:36.640 --> 25:37.993
Look...

25:39.120 --> 25:43.910
...it felt like you had no time for us.
- It was your father who ran away, Sandy.

25:44.480 --> 25:45.754
- Not me.
- Well...

25:46.280 --> 25:47.474
...now who's running away?

25:50.080 --> 25:52.150
Enjoy your cigarette.

26:32.920 --> 26:35.480
- He's pretty great, isn't he?
- Yeah, he is.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.153
You both are.

26:37.320 --> 26:41.279
And I can't thank you enough
for putting me up last night, but...

26:42.040 --> 26:45.589
- What?
- Are you sure it's okay for me to stay?

26:45.760 --> 26:49.548
I mean, now that Ryan's here too, I know
you guys have this history together...

26:49.720 --> 26:52.757
Ryan's my oldest friend, but that's it.
Really.

26:52.920 --> 26:55.514
- I thought when you came to Newport...
- That was a mistake.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.399
I was afraid, so I ran to Ryan
because he's safe.

26:58.640 --> 27:01.996
But it wasn't till I came home and was
honest with Eddie about everything...

27:02.160 --> 27:04.913
...that I realized that I have
nothing to be afraid of.

27:06.600 --> 27:07.794
Neither do you.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.912
As for Ryan, like you said...

27:16.280 --> 27:18.191
...he didn't come here for me.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.271
He came here for you.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.876
Let's go. Come on.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.190
- You still here?
- Not by choice, believe me.

27:40.480 --> 27:42.357
Yeah, well...

27:43.920 --> 27:45.717
...that's too bad.

27:50.040 --> 27:54.079
I've been thinking about it. How
your brother and Arturo are both in jail.

27:54.680 --> 27:56.955
You and I are the only ones
from the old crew left.

27:58.080 --> 28:00.310
I thought you didn't want me here, man.

28:01.960 --> 28:05.555
I thought you came here
for Theresa, okay? It freaked me out.

28:06.720 --> 28:09.553
But I talked to Marissa, you know?
And...

28:11.640 --> 28:13.551
I don't think Marissa
wants me here either.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.073
Come on. Of all the places she
could've picked to go, she chose Chino.

28:18.600 --> 28:21.398
Dude, she picked the one place
she knew only you could find her.

28:24.400 --> 28:27.437
- Setheleh? You in there?
- Yeah, I am.

28:27.600 --> 28:30.751
I'm just gonna be down
in a second, though, okay?

28:32.160 --> 28:34.754
Or I could save you the schlep.

28:37.240 --> 28:40.550
- Can a person come in?
- Yeah, of course.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.199
Come in.

28:46.040 --> 28:49.430
- Where's Summer?
- She went to change for dinner.

28:52.920 --> 28:55.639
- So were you just not gonna tell me?
- Not if I could help it.

28:55.800 --> 28:59.190
- Did you think I couldn't handle it?
- No, doll, I knew you could handle it.

28:59.360 --> 29:01.430
Me, on the other hand...

29:01.600 --> 29:04.160
...I wanted to spend this time...

29:04.480 --> 29:06.755
...getting to know you.

29:09.440 --> 29:13.718
Not be the dying nana, where every
conversation could possibly be the last.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.712
- Yeah, but it could, right?
- Yeah, sure, that's always true though.

29:17.880 --> 29:20.155
Cancer or no cancer.

29:20.320 --> 29:22.629
We could all be dead tomorrow.
You never know.

29:22.800 --> 29:26.236
- That's really comforting, thank you.
- Don't mention it.

29:28.960 --> 29:33.875
So tell me about Seth Cohen.
You like comic books? Music? Videos?

29:34.040 --> 29:37.316
Yeah, it all seems pretty trivial
right now, though, compared to...

29:37.480 --> 29:39.436
...oh, I don't know, cancer.

29:39.600 --> 29:41.511
See, that's why I didn't want to tell you.

29:41.680 --> 29:44.035
You don't wanna do the chemo?
You're not interested?

29:44.200 --> 29:46.668
Wait. Listen.

29:48.760 --> 29:50.671
It's very complicated.

29:56.240 --> 29:58.117
Are you scared?

29:59.800 --> 30:01.836
What do you think?

30:02.000 --> 30:03.479
I don't know.

30:04.480 --> 30:06.198
Dad said you're not afraid of anything.

30:06.760 --> 30:09.752
Your dad doesn't know me as well
as he thinks he does.

30:11.080 --> 30:14.834
Yeah, well, you're the one
who doesn't wanna stick around...

30:15.640 --> 30:17.596
...so whose fault is that?

30:30.600 --> 30:32.750
- Hi.
- Hey.

30:33.920 --> 30:35.717
- What do you think of Chino?
- Actually...

30:35.880 --> 30:38.678
...I think I can get in more trouble
where I'm from.

30:45.640 --> 30:47.790
I'm sorry about everything.

30:47.960 --> 30:51.635
The trip to L.A., your mom.
But we have to get back.

30:51.840 --> 30:54.308
- The longer we stay, the worse it will get.
- How can it?

30:54.480 --> 30:55.993
- She can put you away.
- Let her try.

30:56.160 --> 31:00.039
- She tried it before, it almost worked.
- This time she'll have to find me first.

31:09.720 --> 31:11.153
- What are you doing?
- Getting out of here.

31:11.320 --> 31:13.276
- To go where?
- I don't know, okay?

31:13.440 --> 31:15.158
I don't know where.
I don't know what I'm doing.

31:15.320 --> 31:17.993
I don't know anything,
except that I can't go back there.

31:18.160 --> 31:21.357
- Well, I can't keep chasing after you.
- Who asked you to?

31:21.520 --> 31:22.794
I don't know why you're here.

31:22.960 --> 31:25.235
Maybe you should think
about it instead of yourself.

31:25.720 --> 31:27.392
- Out of my way
- I'm not going anywhere.

31:27.560 --> 31:29.073
- I mean it!
- I'm not going anywhere.

31:29.240 --> 31:30.434
Get out of my way!

31:30.800 --> 31:33.360
Move. Move.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.039
Get out of my way!

31:38.600 --> 31:40.989
I can't go back there.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.392
Okay.

31:45.240 --> 31:46.673
You're okay.

31:48.200 --> 31:51.078
Okay. It's okay.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.189
Ryan? You in there?

31:58.360 --> 31:59.952
Yeah, just a second.

32:00.120 --> 32:02.236
There's someone here to see you.

32:02.400 --> 32:03.879
Okay.

32:14.120 --> 32:16.111
Hey. Seth told me you were in Chino.

32:16.280 --> 32:18.999
- You can't be here. Why are you here?
- I'm here for Marissa.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.117
- Look, you can't be here now, okay?
- Julie's gonna call the cops if...

32:25.280 --> 32:28.670
You think she's going back with you?
You're the last person she wants to see.

32:28.840 --> 32:30.990
- Well, she's gonna.
- You need to get out of here.

32:31.160 --> 32:33.151
- You need to get out of my way.
- Look, guys...

32:33.320 --> 32:36.357
...this is my engagement party.
Just calm down, okay?

32:36.520 --> 32:38.715
Ryan, get away from him.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.397
Marissa, hey. I just...

32:43.080 --> 32:44.229
Get out of here, Luke.

32:45.560 --> 32:48.313
- It's not what you think.
- She told you to tell me that?

32:48.480 --> 32:50.516
That it's all in my head? That I'm crazy?

32:50.680 --> 32:52.352
- It's not her fault.
- Get out of here.

32:52.520 --> 32:55.637
- Marissa, if you'd just come with me...
- Just go, now.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.232
I'm sorry.

33:17.520 --> 33:21.479
Oh, it smells so good in here. Is it true
we can't eat for another six hours?

33:21.640 --> 33:24.712
The nana's Seder won't take that long,
will it?

33:24.880 --> 33:27.155
Have you seen her Haggadah?

33:29.320 --> 33:31.788
- You're reading it backwards.
- Don't tell anyone.

33:31.960 --> 33:35.350
- Hey, it's okay. Being Jewish is hard.
- You have no idea.

33:36.760 --> 33:39.911
So do you know what happened
to make the nana scary again?

33:40.400 --> 33:42.152
Actually...

33:43.640 --> 33:45.676
What? What's going on in here?

33:46.840 --> 33:49.434
Nothing. I'm gonna go study.

33:49.600 --> 33:51.397
I'll see you at dinner...
Seder. Sorry.

33:54.520 --> 33:56.670
- You told her, didn't you?
- I would never do that.

33:56.840 --> 33:59.229
Then what were you talking about?

33:59.800 --> 34:01.552
How scary you are.

34:05.720 --> 34:07.676
I am scary.

34:10.560 --> 34:14.518
I'd be scary too if I was sick and
suddenly I had to depend on my kids.

34:14.679 --> 34:17.638
Well, see the difference is
I'm not gonna be dependent on my kids.

34:17.800 --> 34:20.518
- No, you would rather die.
- Oh, that's good, Kirsten.

34:20.679 --> 34:22.830
With the honesty.
I didn't know you had it in you.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.514
That's because you don't know me.
You never wanted to.

34:26.480 --> 34:29.277
- And it pretty much cost you your son.
- My son made a choice.

34:29.440 --> 34:32.318
Maybe. But now you can make one.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.472
You can get the best treatment,
you can get to know your grandson...

34:35.639 --> 34:37.596
...and you can have Sandy
back in your life.

34:37.840 --> 34:41.071
But, that's not important to you.

34:41.239 --> 34:44.835
Oh, guilt now, huh?
That's very impressive.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.230
You sure you're not Jewish?

34:54.760 --> 34:55.954
How's she doing?

34:56.199 --> 34:58.919
She's great.
Luke's the one I feel sorry for.

34:59.080 --> 35:02.436
He's gonna have a handprint
on his face for, like, a week.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.192
Sorry about that.

35:04.360 --> 35:07.636
- Showing up, ruining your party.
- Hey, does it look ruined to you?

35:10.280 --> 35:12.748
Besides, it's my engagement party.

35:12.920 --> 35:15.639
If you'd have missed it,
I would've kicked your ass.

35:17.920 --> 35:19.194
I should've invited you.

35:21.680 --> 35:23.113
So invite me to the wedding.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.679
Yeah. You'll bring Marissa.

35:28.520 --> 35:30.670
All right, who wants cake?

35:30.840 --> 35:33.115
Actually, I can't. I gotta get back.

35:33.720 --> 35:36.154
Dinner at the Cohens'.
Seth's grandma's in town.

35:36.320 --> 35:37.958
Can't miss it.

35:41.160 --> 35:44.197
Yeah, well, you two are welcome to stay
as long as you want.

35:44.360 --> 35:46.510
Come on, Eddie, my mom needs
help in the kitchen.

35:46.920 --> 35:49.559
- I'm eating cake.
- No, you're not.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.673
Oh, okay. I got it. See?

35:52.840 --> 35:55.559
Not even married yet,
she's already bossing me around.

35:59.720 --> 36:02.712
- I don't wanna go back.
- I know.

36:02.880 --> 36:06.316
But you didn't do anything wrong.
They did. They know that.

36:06.480 --> 36:08.675
Your mom's freaking out.
She's afraid you'll tell.

36:08.840 --> 36:10.910
Why would I tell?

36:11.080 --> 36:14.152
I don't wanna see them ever again,
and I don't wanna go back.

36:14.320 --> 36:16.197
Yeah, but what about your dad?

36:17.320 --> 36:19.390
Kaitlin? Summer?

36:20.480 --> 36:23.153
What about me?
What am I supposed to do without you?

36:24.720 --> 36:28.633
I mean, I'd get over you eventually,
but it'd take a while.

36:38.520 --> 36:42.593
I couldn't find an actual Seder plate,
so I'm using this one.

36:42.760 --> 36:45.672
Well, that's because we don't have
an actual Seder plate, Ma.

36:45.840 --> 36:49.435
This is the first actual Seder we've ever
had. We usually go to the Ackermans'.

36:49.600 --> 36:52.592
But you're here this year, and Ryan.

36:53.720 --> 36:55.676
I've been finding homes
for kids like Ryan...

36:55.840 --> 36:57.831
...for over 40 years.
- I know, Ma.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.673
Yeah, but I never once thought
to bring one home with me.

37:02.320 --> 37:05.790
- Had to show up your own mother?
- He's a good kid.

37:05.960 --> 37:08.315
You should spend some time with him.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.039
I can't.

37:13.680 --> 37:16.433
I'm flying home early tomorrow.

37:16.600 --> 37:19.876
Well, you don't want me to miss
my first treatment, do you?

37:20.040 --> 37:22.156
Oh, Ma, thanks.

37:26.600 --> 37:29.398
Hey, you know, you could
have it out here, if you want.

37:29.560 --> 37:32.518
No, honey, thanks, but I like Dr. Talley.

37:32.680 --> 37:35.353
And your sister's there
and your brother.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.557
- And, you know, I hate California.
- So maybe I could come visit.

37:38.720 --> 37:41.951
Please, your mother's
gonna be having chemo.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.314
It's the least you can do.

37:52.520 --> 37:56.229
- You sure you wanna do this now?
- I have to. My clothes are inside.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.958
Maybe she won't be home.

37:58.920 --> 38:01.639
- Oh, thank God you're back.
- I'm not.

38:01.800 --> 38:04.360
- I just came to get my stuff and go.
- The hell you are.

38:04.520 --> 38:06.033
You are not leaving this house.

38:06.200 --> 38:10.432
Or what? You're gonna call the police or
Dr. Milano? You know what? Go ahead.

38:10.600 --> 38:13.751
In fact, why don't you call up
Dad while you're at it, and Caleb too?

38:13.920 --> 38:15.876
I'd really love to tell them
why I ran away.

38:19.560 --> 38:20.834
Get your stuff and leave.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.038
Gladly.

38:31.760 --> 38:33.352
Hey. You're here.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.829
Yeah. Is that okay? I wasn't sure.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.797
No, of course. Come on in.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.038
Here's a little...

38:40.800 --> 38:44.395
...holiday-appropriate bouquet.
- Thanks.

38:44.560 --> 38:47.438
So, listen, I was thinking
about what you said today...

38:47.600 --> 38:50.273
...as I ate most of those cupcakes
and, like...

38:50.440 --> 38:52.476
...that whole box of cookies
you brought by...

38:52.640 --> 38:56.076
...and you're right.
You're right about everything.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.629
No, you were right. I'm sorry.

38:58.800 --> 39:01.473
I was? Are you sure?
Because that's rarely the case.

39:01.680 --> 39:04.558
No, I mean, Kirsten and I
are finally getting along.

39:04.720 --> 39:07.757
And I have a second chance
with my dad.

39:08.160 --> 39:09.673
So why risk all of that?

39:10.040 --> 39:12.508
Because it'll be fun
and because I'm self-destructive...

39:12.680 --> 39:16.832
...and because you're incredible,
and I can't help myself.

39:17.960 --> 39:19.473
Really?

39:23.080 --> 39:26.390
- Are we really gonna do this?
- I think we already are.

39:26.560 --> 39:28.915
But I think the real question...

39:29.080 --> 39:31.435
...is how are we gonna tell Kirsten...

39:31.600 --> 39:34.319
...without sustaining bodily injuries?

39:34.480 --> 39:35.959
Well...

39:37.160 --> 39:39.276
...she doesn't have to know
right away, does she?

39:42.640 --> 39:45.950
For on all other nights,
we do not dip our food into salt water.

39:46.120 --> 39:51.148
But tonight we dip karpas into salt water
and maror into charoses.

39:52.280 --> 39:54.396
Did you just do that all by heart?

39:54.760 --> 39:57.479
- Was it okay?
- It was perfect.

39:57.640 --> 39:59.596
You can use the book.
Didn't I tell you that?

39:59.760 --> 40:02.672
- No! Cohen!
- You're good, you're my little <i>chachem</i>.

40:05.680 --> 40:08.399
- Hey, sorry we're late.
- Hey.

40:08.840 --> 40:11.479
- I'm so sorry, Coop.
- It's okay. Really, we're fine.

40:11.640 --> 40:13.392
- You see Luke?
- We won't see him for a while.

40:13.560 --> 40:16.677
- How'd you manage that?
- I didn't. Marissa smacked him.

40:16.920 --> 40:19.753
- Nice, Coop!
- She's hangs out with you too much.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.031
- Hey, you guys ready to eat?
- Yes!

40:22.200 --> 40:25.158
Well, that's too bad, because
the Seder's about to begin. Come on.

40:28.400 --> 40:31.915
- How was everything at home?
- You tell me. I was in Chino.

40:36.760 --> 40:39.752
"Tonight we celebrate
the first night of Passover.

40:39.920 --> 40:43.435
A celebration of rebirth,
of new beginnings...

40:43.600 --> 40:45.477
...and of freedom.

40:45.640 --> 40:48.313
Freedom from the constraints
that have bound us.

40:48.480 --> 40:52.393
And freedom to join together
to take responsibility for ourselves...

40:52.560 --> 40:55.836
...for our families, for our community...

40:56.000 --> 40:57.718
...and for the world."

41:00.880 --> 41:02.598
Do we eat now?

41:03.440 --> 41:05.556
Ryan, we've got, like, six more hours.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.631
Yeah, strap in.

41:08.920 --> 41:11.275
Let's all raise our glasses.
