WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
They control the hearts
and minds of the people.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
-How?
-With magic.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Well, you look like you've seen a ghost.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
-I'm back, brother.
-Harka is risen!

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Many have sworn
their allegiance to the Dead Man.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Led into darkness by the dark itself.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
The Romans came,
they burned our village.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
You heard of a tribe called the Devni?

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Find someone else this time.
My sister's Queen.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
There remains one hope. A maiden.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Who, if she pleases the gods,
may save us.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Your poxy gods can go
and fuck themselves.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
It was not the gods
who made your sister queen.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Then who was it?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
I intend to have those lands
one way or another.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
I'll have a column of men nearby,
ready to persuade them.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
-Get back in line.
-Since when do we forgive mutineers?

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
I think we found a witch doctor's stash.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
-My beautiful sister.
-You've been gone a long time.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
The Cantii whore comes to poison us.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
-This is no longer your tribe.
-Rome is our future.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
You will never turn me
against the Druids.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
You were a warrior once.
You will be a warrior again.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
The demon is here.
And the maiden is coming.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
-Sister!
-You will die for this betrayal.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
-No!
-You're ready.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
I will find her. Show me!

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
-I think he was having us on.
-Shaun the Shaman?

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
We were out of our minds
on whatever he gave us.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
I can't even remember the directions.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
You follow the moon at sunrise,
for four days.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
And then you cross a deep, dark river.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
-Where you almost drowned.
-I was fine.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
Then you head uphill, until you see
a peak crowned with rocks.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
With a massive bear
that Shaun forgot to tell us about.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
He doesn't know
where all the bears live.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Then you enter the woods
where the rivers meet, and there...

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
-You find the Tears of Gods.
-You find the Tears of Gods.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Rings of magic fruit,
as far as the eye can see.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
We've been in this wood two days.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Not even a toadstool.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
-I'm calling it. It's not here.
-Huh? But...

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
We haven't found the singing pond yet...

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Fuck the singing pond! Fuck this shit.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Big river's that way. I'm out of here.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
But we've come so far.
It must be close.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
The edge of the wood is just over there.
You coming?

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
-Philo.
-I'm done. I must be nuts!

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
-Philo.
-What? What is it?

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
-Attention!
-Bummer.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
When I look out my window

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Many sights to see

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
And when I look in my window

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
So many different people to be

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Oh, no

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
Must be the season of the witch

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
Must be the season of the witch, yeah

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Must be the season of the witch

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
You got to pick up every stitch

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
The rabbits running in the ditch

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Beatnicks are out to make it rich

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
It will be good to see her face again.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
To hear her voice again.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Don't you want to hear it, my love?

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Her sweet, sweet voice.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
I hate to be the bringer of bad news,
but it seems, as we speak,

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
your sister is communing with the gods.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
Not about whether
to follow your regal advice. No.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
She would only know
the means of your execution.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Flayed? Burned?

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Buried alive?
Torn apart by dogs?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Disemboweled?

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
It's all to play for.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
I demand to speak with Veran.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
You genuinely think
you can summon the Veran?

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
You know I can. And you know why.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
You wouldn't dare.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Try me.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Wake up.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Be careful!

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
There.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Can you hear me?

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
-Where am I?
-I'll tell you where you are, sunshine.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Right in the middle
of my fucking prophecy!

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
He's bleeding. What's your name?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
-I can't remember.
-Perfect.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
You were in the river. Chained.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Can you remember how you got there?
Who did it?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
I can't remember anything.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
You stole a mule
or you got someone pregnant.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Either way,
whoever it was had enough of you.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
-No. He needs to sit down.
-He needs to leave.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
-He nearly drowned.
-He needs to leave!

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Then we need to work out what to do

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
now you've fucked up
the Sacred Trial of Sister Water!

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
You make me sick!

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Where's he gone?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
-Ah, ah. No, you don't.
-But he...

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Leave this to me.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
You have no idea the damage you've done.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
-Oh, I don't believe this.
-Believe what?

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
My idiot brother's borrowing money
to buy hides.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
I can't believe they made Maximus
the new Tessera.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
Thinks he's the dogs now.
Look at him. Big, bald twat.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Oh, no. No, I don't believe it.
My sister's getting married.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
You've got a sister? She fit?

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
-To some fat wanker.
-On your feet, scrotums!

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Sir, yes, sir!

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
-This a vacation, ladies?
-Sir, no sir.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Sir, if I may congratulate you
on your promotion.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
Richly deserved. It's an honor to serve
under so valiant and strong a legionary.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
-Mate, you got some poo on your nose.
-Oh, shut up.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Oh, there you are.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
-It's time to go.
-Where?

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
Head west.
There's a settlement half a day's walk.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
Here. That's for bed and bread. So...

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Oh, I see.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Yeah. Except you don't.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
You genuinely do not see.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Have you ever spent your entire life,

10:21.000 --> 10:27.000
all your skills, training body,
spirit, soul, for one moment?

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Your friend saved my life.
I have to thank her.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Much as I'd love that, it's impossible.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
So...

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Well...

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Ge...

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
The Arms of the Eagle. Oh, no.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
Our friend is going to stay
with us for a few days.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
-Just until he feels a bit better.
-You serious?

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
-Yes. Good.
-Thank you.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
You hungry?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Make this stop,

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
or I'll bring you and this whole place
down into the dirt.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
And your cheap whore gods
along with you. You know I can.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Why else did you come here?

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
-I came to save my...
-You came as Rome's lackey.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
But Rome is using you.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Not to swap peace for taxes,

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
or preserve our ways,
our faith, our gods.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Fuck your gods!

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
Your days are over, which reminds me,
your witch, Willa, was captured.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
The General cut off her fingers.
She broke.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
Now, he knows a lot more about you
than you'd like.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Rome only wants the Chosen One.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
She's the only thing that Rome fears.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I'm not interested in fables
and prophecies.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
Here's what I want. Pop off,
have a smoke, chat with the gods,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
or whatever fucking bullshit it is
you do,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
then tell Andra
the gods have changed their minds.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
You did it for Rome.
Don't say you didn't.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
You killed Pellenor
to buy more time with the Romans.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
You did it for them. Now do it for me.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
I cannot do such a thing.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
I bet you can, you cunt.
I bet you fucking can.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
You say you came here to save her.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
If that's true, you must now go
to your death. Accept this sacrifice.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Oh, handy. It's handy for you.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Get me out of the way.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
Well, mighty Veran, to do that,
I would need something.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Something I lost a long time ago.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
-And what is that?
-My heart.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
You once asked if I still had one.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
But you knew the answer
because you took it from me,

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
many years ago.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
Follow this path
and you will destroy her.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
You're a whore.
It takes one to know one.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
-Then your path is chosen.
-I will tell her everything!

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Everything.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
You're safe now.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
You just have to rest. You're safe now.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Thank you.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
-What's that?
-This is where we are.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Where we are now. Stuck.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
You must sit at this point,
this nowhere point,

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
and beg the gods for guidance.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
-Really?
-In complete silence. No interruptions.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Until sunset.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Now!

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Totally.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
That's us, down there.
We used to be them.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
Look at them.
Asleep with their eyes open.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
They're having a nightmare.
Let's wake 'em up.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Oh, that is a such a good idea.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
This taste funny to you?

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
Ever since I passed the White Cliffs,
everything I've eaten or drank

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
in this God forsaken rat hole
tastes of mud.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
-Tastes a bit muddy.
-Well, there's a fucking surprise.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Go on. Drink up, maggots. Hurry up.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
General Aulus. Is the General home?

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Thought you'd be good at this.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Stealthy. In and out like a ghost.

17:18.000 --> 17:23.000
I've drafted charges against you.
The column you dispatched.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
It wasn't sent to guard
a supply caravan.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
-Oh, I believe it was.
-I believe my spies.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
It was seen heading west.
Towards the Devni.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
-Well, that's weird.
-That's indictable.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
Misleading an officer of the senate,
misuse of imperial forces.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
It was a strategically
sensitive mission.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
Extending our forces that far west
without authority is...

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
Is the key to this campaign.
The Devni lands.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
It's how we win Britannia.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Really? How so?

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
-The Druids have a sacred lake.
-A lake?

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
It's their most secret and sacred place.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
If I get that, no more Druids,
no more resistance.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
The Druids again.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
I'm sending this to the senate
before your failure stains me.

18:25.000 --> 18:31.000
Tairus, Antiagus, Nazareth,

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
Veritas, Judea. Did I fail there?

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
Or did I win kingdoms' riches
and glory for Rome?

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
Those hell holes.
Those impossible conquests.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
How did I do that now?
Because I know how to win.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
Your triumphs were indeed noted.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
Some thought them highly patriotic.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
Others smelled something...

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
...zealous.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
Devotion to a deeper,
more personal master than Rome.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
What do you say?

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
Take your pick. I know one thing.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
The senate loves success.

19:22.000 --> 19:27.000
This lake, if it's so important,
why send your Cantii whore?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Because she has something in her heart.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
Something that will
destroy their entire faith,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
and everything they've built upon it.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
What is it?

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
A lie.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
It's such a lovely day.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
Huh, now that you mention it, wow.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
This is nice, too.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Making our stuff all clean and shiny.

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
I know. I normally hate doing this,
but it's actually very enjoyable.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Polishy.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
-Polishy.
-Polish. Right.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Okay.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Sir? Sir, Sir.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
Oh, it's you. Hello, there.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
Sir, Tessera Maximus. He's...

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Look, look.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Well, now that is first class.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Have you seen this?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Sir?

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
What in the name of all the gods
is going on?

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Oi. How many fingers am I holding up?

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Fuck off. I'm fine.
Been watching it all for an hour.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
This is dark magic. Mark my words.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Listen, someone needs to ride a signal
to the legion.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Right.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Sod this for a game of soldiers.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
No!

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
-Ah, fuck!
- Are you awake?

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
Can you remember anything? Your name?

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I just can't.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
I don't have a name either.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
I wanted to say to you...

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
I can't thank you enough for saving me.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
What's this?

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
I don't know.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Perhaps there are more.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Perhaps we should look.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
-Dear gods.
-What is it?

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
What's wrong?

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
What is it?

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
-Wake up!
-Fucking hell.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
-You saw it, didn't you? By the river.
-What?

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
That's why he's here.
Why you didn't send him away.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
-I might have.
-You bastard!

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
You made me sit by a fucking stick
all day in silence when you knew.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
-For God's sake.
-I had to be sure.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
It's a two foot-high fucking eagle.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
-What part weren't you sure about?
-Ye gods, you're strong.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
We don't know anything.
We need to wait. And watch.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Sister.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Have you spoken with Veran?

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
I do not need Veran to decide your fate.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
I'm the Keeper of the Lake.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
The gods speak with me also.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
And what have the gods told you?

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
That to quell their anger...

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
..on the third dawn,

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
your skin will be stripped,
and your body burned.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
Your ashes sealed and buried
at the foot of our tallest oak.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
My sweet sister.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Veran...

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
Veran is a devil. A whore.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
You will not change my mind, sister.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
The Demon is Rome.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
And you are the Demon's envoy.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
Then, sister, grant me one final wish.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
I feel air.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
I can see the bits that make up air.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
And I'm a part of it.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
We're all a part of it.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
I don't feel so good.

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
Every time I breathe,
I feel it enter me.

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
Or do I enter it?
Are me and it the same?

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
Is there an it?

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
Is there even a me?

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
Oh, shit!

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Oh, hey.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
All right?

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
How are we all getting on?

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
I know you from somewhere.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Your face.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
I deserted your cohort,
and saved my arse.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
And you got tortured.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
But that's all in the past now.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
Hey, Philo, how's it going
out there, man?

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Oh...

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
I remember my family being murdered
when I was very young.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
When the Romans came,
my father told me to sing.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
Said I couldn't be hurt
if I sang this song.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
So I sang.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
He was right.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
I survived.

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
I feel like that was happening to me
when you were saying that. Fuck.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
I see what you're saying
but we can't let them out.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
Them in there, us out here.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Only because of the bars, man.

29:57.000 --> 30:02.000
The bars are important.
Keeps it... tidy.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
-Tidy?
-I actually don't know anymore.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
Maybe you're on the wrong side
of the bars.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
Ever think of that? Open it.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
You're only freeing yourselves.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
-Makes sense.
-Fine by me.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
You know what?
I think we did a good thing here.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
No!

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
What happened to us? Witchcraft?

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
-I thought it was lovely.
-Me, too.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
I felt some profound insights
that I can take into the rest of my...

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Oh, shit!

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Where are you fucking going?

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
Form up! Now! On me, I say.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
Form up on me!

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Fucking form up.

31:47.000 --> 31:53.000
-Shit! Fuck! Form up.
-Fight!

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Counter!

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
For the glory of Rome!

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
For the glory of Rome!

33:57.000 --> 34:02.000
-Fuck this.
-Rufus! Oh, fuck!

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
You have until the sun is set.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Mother?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
I've come home.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Are you a ghost?

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
That's right, Mummy. I'm a ghost.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Would you like to hear a story, Mummy?

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
One from long ago.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
Once upon a time,
there was a little girl.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
She wasn't any ordinary little girl.
She was a princess.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
She lived with her mummy and daddy,
the king and queen,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
and she loved them both very much.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
Her mummy taught her how to dance
and sing.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Her daddy taught her how to ride
and hunt.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
She was very happy.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
And then the time came
for her Solstice rite.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
She was to be a woman.

36:49.000 --> 36:53.000
On the eve of her Solstice,
and when she was dressed in white,

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
face painted, lying in bed,
in silence...

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
..her daddy, the king, came to her.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
And he raped her.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
And one moon after that,
she became with child.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Her mother, the queen...

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
...she knew what had happened.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
And she did nothing.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
She said it was the will of the gods.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
The girl was locked away
for many months after that,

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
until the child was born.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
A beautiful baby girl.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
They named her Andra.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
When the child was three years old...

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
..a Druid came and took her away.

38:01.000 --> 38:05.000
The princess didn't see
her child again until she was grown.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
She was made to call her her sister.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
And then, one day, she was packed away,

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
far away, to a distant tribe...
To marry a prince.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
His name was Phelan, of the Cantii.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
They knew that
if her secret was found out,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
it would destroy everything.

38:25.000 --> 38:29.000
Isca, the Devni,
the faith of our tribes.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
The princess saw through all the lies.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
And one question burned inside her.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
"How could the gods allow this?"

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
The king died.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
The queen...

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
..went slowly mad.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
And Andra...

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
She became the Keeper of the Lake.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
And nobody knew the truth.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
Nobody except the queen,

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
the Druid, and the princess.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Poor little girl.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Poor little girl.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
The dark is come.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
The dark is come.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
The dark is come!

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Well played, brother.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Well played.
