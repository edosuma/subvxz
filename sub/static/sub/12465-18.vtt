WE COULD GET A BIG GROUP
TOGETHER AND ALL HANG.

JUST THE TWO OF US...

AS A COUPLE.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.486
EXACTLY, UM, BUT--

03:41.488 --> 03:43.121
BUT INSTEAD
OF WATCHING A MOVIE,

03:43.123 --> 03:45.390
I WAS THINKING
WE COULD PLAY...

03:45.392 --> 03:47.426
<i>FLUGELBALL!</i>

03:48.596 --> 03:50.596

<i>FLUGELBALL.</i>

03:52.633 --> 03:54.433
IT'S TUNDRABANIA'S
NATIONAL SPORT.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.468
IT IS WAY BETTER
THAN BASKETBALL.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.538
WOW, YOU'RE LIKE SERIOUS.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.741
TUNDRABANIA'S HAD
QUITE THE IMPACT ON YOU.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.443
YEAH, BUT IT WASN'T
JUST TUNDRABANIA.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.479
ON MY WAY HOME, I GOT TO SEE
RUSSIA, SPAIN, SWEDEN.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.565

IT REALLY OPENED MY EYES.

04:09.566 --> 04:11.650

KIND OF FEELS SMALL.

INSIGNIFICANT STEVENS POINT,

04:16.457 --> 04:18.156
I APOLOGIZE.

04:18.158 --> 04:19.591
OKAY,
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.494
STEVENS POINT WILL
NEVER BE INSIGNIFICANT

ABSOLUTELY NO WAY

LET YOU WIN!

04:33.173 --> 04:34.439
ARGH!

04:35.175 --> 04:36.575
OH!

04:36.577 --> 04:37.709

04:43.517 --> 04:44.683
THE NEXT TIME WE PUT

04:44.685 --> 04:47.219
A HYDROGEN-FLUORIDE LASER
ON OUR ROBOT,

04:47.221 --> 04:49.187
WE SHOULD TAKE THE CAP OFF

04:49.189 --> 04:50.689
BEFORE WE FIRE IT.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.724
HEY!

04:58.198 --> 05:00.198
SORRY ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS,
GUMBALL MACHINE.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.734
I GIVE OFF A VIBE
THAT TENDS TO SCATTER GEEKS.

05:04.238 --> 05:06.538
DUMP TRUCK IS A FRIEND
I MADE IN DETENTION,

05:06.540 --> 05:09.474
WHICH IS ALSO WHERE I GOT
THE MONIKER "GUMBALL MACHINE."

05:09.476 --> 05:11.543
IT TURNS OUT
THAT KIDS IN DETENTION

05:11.545 --> 05:13.545
COME UP WITH
THE SICKEST NICKNAMES.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.781
JUST ASK
"HAMMERHEAD" GONZALES.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.183
WHERE'RE YOU HEADED?

05:18.184 --> 05:19.650
IT'S TRASH CONVERGENCE DAY
AT THE DUMP.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.487
YOU SHOULD COME WITH ME.
SIX GARBAGE TRUCKS LET OUT
AT THE SAME TIME.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.257
OH, MAN, THAT SOUNDS COOL.

05:25.259 --> 05:28.727
IT'S MORE THAN COOL.
IT'S-- IT'S TRANSFORMATIVE.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.530
NOW GET YOUR
GIDDYUP PANTS ON.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.565
IT'S A LONG WALK
AND WE'RE RUNNING LATE.

05:33.566 --> 05:35.599
- LET'S TAKE OUR BIKES.
- UM, I DON'T HAVE A BIKE.

05:35.602 --> 05:38.236
YOU WANT TO BORROW JOEY'S BIKE?
I KNOW HIS LOCK COMBINATION.

05:38.238 --> 05:41.640
I WOULD,
BUT BORROWING SOMEONE'S BIKE
WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION

05:41.642 --> 05:44.776
IS MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE
AND AGAINST MY ETHOS.

05:44.778 --> 05:47.512
ALL RIGHT, YOU RIDE MY BIKE
AND I'LL RIDE JOEY'S.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.547
WHAT'S WITH YOU
AND THE BIKES?

05:48.549 --> 05:50.248
I SAID WE'RE WALKING,
SO LET'S WALK.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.517
OH, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM
WITH BIKES?

05:52.519 --> 05:54.820
I GOT NO PROBLEM WITH BIKES.
I LOVE 'EM.

05:54.822 --> 05:57.589
YOU GET ON THE THING
AND YOU START GOING.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.791
THEN YOU GOT TO TURN,
SO YOU PRESS THE TURN BUTTON.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.528
"TURN BUTTON"?

06:03.530 --> 06:06.865
YEAH.
IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE...

06:08.268 --> 06:09.534
BRAKE LASER.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.804
WHOA. YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO RIDE A BIKE.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.740
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

06:14.742 --> 06:17.709
I WILL PUNCH YOU
IN YOUR SMILING DEVICE.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.679
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.547
WAIT TILL I TELL
HAMMERHEAD GONZALES.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.616
HEY, ZIP YOUR SOUP COOLER!

06:24.618 --> 06:27.686
IT IS MY SECRET SHAME
AND THE GREATEST REGRET
OF MY YOUNG LIFE,

06:27.688 --> 06:30.856
WHICH IS SAYING SOMETHING
BECAUSE I HAVE SOME SKELETONS,
GUMBALL.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.659
I COULD TEACH YOU
HOW TO RIDE A BIKE.

06:35.662 --> 06:37.829
SERIOUSLY?
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME?

06:37.831 --> 06:39.765
HEY, WE ALL HAVE
OUR SECRET SHAMES.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.833
YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES IN THE CAR,

06:41.835 --> 06:43.735
I SING ALONG
WITH TAYLOR SWIFT.

06:44.671 --> 06:46.671
OOH, REALLY?

06:46.673 --> 06:48.607
NO, I'M JUST TRYING TO
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER, BUDDY.

I KINDA NEED SOME GIRL TALK.

GINGER SNAPS,

07:34.822 --> 07:36.721
OOH, I'M SO EXCITED,
I COULD SPIT.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.691

- GET OUT OF MY WAY!

07:39.693 --> 07:41.893
I'M A PART OF GIRL TALK.
I'M A PART OF GIRL TALK!

THE OTHER HALF LIVES.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.769
"LISTENING HOLES"?

07:50.771 --> 07:52.771
YOU'VE BEEN HANGING OUT

08:01.882 --> 08:02.981
IT'S JUST...

08:02.983 --> 08:06.852

KIND OF DIFFERENT SINCE
HE'S GOTTEN BACK.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.920
<i>I MEAN, YOU KNOW,</i>
<i>HE BLEW OFF</i>

08:08.922 --> 08:12.691
MIGGIE-MOVIE NIGHT,
AND HE'S NOT AS INTO BASKETBALL.

08:13.427 --> 08:14.793
<i>IT'S JUST WEIRD.</i>

08:14.795 --> 08:16.828
OKAY, WELL...

08:16.830 --> 08:18.864
I MEAN, MAYBE HE JUST
NEEDS SOME TIME TO ADJUST.

08:18.866 --> 08:21.666
I MEAN, WE BOTH KNOW THAT WHEN
I CAME BACK TO STEVENS POINT,

08:21.668 --> 08:24.736
YOU AND I DIDN'T EXACTLY
FALL INTO OUR OLD RHYTHM
IMMEDIATELY...

08:25.839 --> 08:27.739
BUT EVENTUALLY WE GOT THERE.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.443

08:31.445 --> 08:32.777
HE'S JUST NOT REALLY

08:32.779 --> 08:34.679
THE SAME GUY
THAT I STARTED DATING.

08:35.782 --> 08:39.851
OOH, SOUNDS LIKE MADDIE
AND DIGGIE ARE HAVING PROBLEMS.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.854

IT'S OVER FOR YOU AND DIGGIE.

TO COOL. WHAT DO I DO?

08:47.427 --> 08:48.727
GO TO HIM.

08:49.796 --> 08:52.964
YOU NEED TO RELAX, MADDIE.
I MEAN, HE JUST GOT BACK.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.900
I'M SURE THINGS
ARE A LITTLE AWKWARD,

THE GOAL OF <i> FLUGELBALL</i>

09:31.772 --> 09:34.773
IS TO KICK THIS FUR-BALL
INTO THE OPPONENTS TURNIP PILE,

09:34.775 --> 09:36.775
AND THE WINNER GETS
TO KEEP THE TURNIPS.

09:36.777 --> 09:37.943
Joey: <i> OKAY.</i>

09:37.945 --> 09:39.511
AND WHAT ARE
THESE BALLS FOR?

09:39.513 --> 09:41.012
AAH, WE WEAR THESE.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.481
ANCIENT TUNDRABANIANS
ACTUALLY PLAYED

09:43.483 --> 09:45.884
WEARING THE BLADDER
OF A BLUE WHALE, BUT...

09:45.886 --> 09:47.986
( laughs )
WE'RE MORE CIVILIZED NOW.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.855
I'M GAME.
LET'S DO THIS.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.390
OOH, ACTUALLY WE CAN'T START

09:52.391 --> 09:53.924
UNTIL WE HAVE
AN EVEN NUMBER OF PLAYERS.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.894
WE NEED ONE MORE
TO <i> FLUGEL.</i>

10:00.867 --> 10:02.067
( gasps )

10:02.069 --> 10:04.069
HOW ABOUT A FLU-GAL?

10:07.774 --> 10:09.941
- HEY.
- WELL, HEY THERE, ROONEY.
I'M GLAD YOU MADE IT.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.810
( giggles )
YEAH.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.879
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE INTO THIS,
THEN I'M INTO THIS.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.917
OKAY, SO THIS SEEMS LIKE
THE DUMBEST THING EVER,

10:18.919 --> 10:20.952
BUT I REALLY WANTED
TO DO WHATEVER I COULD

10:20.954 --> 10:22.053
TO GET US
BACK INTO OUR GROOVE.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.089
I MEAN, BESIDES...

10:24.091 --> 10:25.924
HOW BAD CAN THIS BE?
IT'S A SPORT.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.994
YOU KNOW? AS LONG
AS THERE'S A WINNER,
I'M FINE. ( laughs )

10:28.996 --> 10:30.962
AS LONG AS
THAT WINNER IS ME!

10:31.898 --> 10:33.932
FLUGELERS,
ASSUME THE POSITION!

10:34.901 --> 10:36.534
<i>FLUGEL!</i>

10:36.536 --> 10:37.969
<i>FLUGEL!</i>

10:37.971 --> 10:40.005
<i>FLUGEL!</i>

10:41.008 --> 10:43.008
( conk blares )

10:47.881 --> 10:48.980
( Joey grunts )

10:49.916 --> 10:51.149
( grunts continue )

10:55.956 --> 10:56.921
( conk blares )

10:57.858 --> 10:59.024
FLUGEL-KICK!
THAT'S A FOUL.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.558
WHAT?

11:00.560 --> 11:02.160
( Joey grunts )

11:02.162 --> 11:05.080
OH, COME ON, REF!

11:05.081 --> 11:07.999
I'M SORRY, ROONEY.
YOU HAVE TO SPEND ONE MINUTE
IN THE <i> UMSKAUEN.</i>

11:08.001 --> 11:10.135
IT'S THE TUNDRABANIAN
PENALTY BOX.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.938
YEAH, MADDIE, GET IN
THE <i> UMSKAUEN, </i> YOU CHEATER.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.842
OKAY, FINE.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.978
BUT I AM LOOKING FOR YOU
WHEN I GET OUT!

11:31.625 --> 11:32.891
( sighs )

11:34.061 --> 11:36.161
SO NOW DO WE PLAY WITH
ONE LESS <i> FLUGELER</i> , OR...

11:36.163 --> 11:38.063
NOPE, NOW WE JUST WAIT.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.998
IN TUNDRABANIA,
THIS WOULD BE THE PART

11:40.000 --> 11:43.134
WHERE WE'D WHACK
OUR FROZEN TOES WITH A ROCK
TO BRING BACK CIRCULATION.

11:45.038 --> 11:48.006
BUT HOW COOL IS THIS?
MADDIE REALLY SEEMS TO
BE ENJOYING <i> FLUGELBALL.</i>

11:48.008 --> 11:49.641
YEAH, TOTALLY FRESH AND SAUCY.

11:49.643 --> 11:51.076
QUICK QUESTION.

11:52.646 --> 11:56.014
IF YOU BEING SO WEIRD SINCE
YOU GOT BACK FROM TUNDRABANIA

11:56.016 --> 11:57.882
MADE MADDIE BREAK UP WITH YOU,

11:57.884 --> 11:59.184
WE'D STILL HANG OUT.
RIGHT, BUDDY?

12:01.021 --> 12:02.087
DUDE?

12:05.926 --> 12:09.627
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, MAN?
IS MADDIE GONNA BREAK UP
WITH ME?

12:09.629 --> 12:11.196
( squeaks )

12:11.198 --> 12:14.099
NO.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.935
SO SHE IS GONNA
BREAK UP WITH ME?

12:16.937 --> 12:19.104
I NEVER SAID THAT.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.272
IF I HAVE TO CHOOSE...

12:22.642 --> 12:23.908
I CHOOSE YOU, BUDDY.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.076
<i>( conk blares )</i>

12:25.078 --> 12:27.212
ALL RIGHT, JOEY...

12:28.982 --> 12:30.915
GET READY
TO TASTE TURNIP!

12:32.185 --> 12:33.985
MADDIE, ARE WE OKAY?

12:33.987 --> 12:35.954
'CAUSE JOEY JUST SAID
THAT YOU'RE GONNA
BREAK UP WITH ME.

12:35.956 --> 12:36.988
WHAT?

12:37.924 --> 12:39.090
I DID NOT...
( nervous chuckle )

12:39.092 --> 12:41.126
...SAY THAT.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.194
I MERELY POSED
A HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION

12:43.196 --> 12:46.998
BASED ON INFORMATION
THAT I GAINED THROUGH
EAVESDROPPING.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.703
JOEY, I CANNOT
BELIEVE YOU RIGHT NOW!

12:51.705 --> 12:53.138
( high-pitch squeal )

12:57.944 --> 13:00.111
SO... IS IT TRUE?

13:03.016 --> 13:06.017
I MEAN--
OKAY, SO THINGS HAVE
BEEN A LITTLE WEIRD,

13:06.019 --> 13:07.535
BUT I JUST THINK
WE NEED SOME TIME

13:07.536 --> 13:09.052
TO, YOU KNOW, GET USED
TO EACH OTHER AGAIN

13:09.055 --> 13:11.689
AND THEN EVERYTHING
WILL BE LIKE IT WAS.

13:11.691 --> 13:14.058
- OKAY, SO WE'RE GOOD?
- NO, YEAH, NO, NO.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.126
WE'RE GOOD.
WE'RE GOOD.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.195
- ( sighs ) OKAY.
- ( laughs )

13:17.197 --> 13:18.696
READY TO PLAY
SOME <i> FLUGELBALL?</i>

13:18.698 --> 13:19.964
( laughs )
YOU KNOW IT.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.168
WHOO!
GLAD I FIXED THIS.

13:26.106 --> 13:29.107
WELCOME TO BIKE THEORY 101.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.976
FIRST TOPIC...

13:31.978 --> 13:33.178
HOW BIKES STAY UP.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.313
I ALWAYS WONDERED ABOUT THAT.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.284
FIRST WE MUST UNDERSTAND
SPIN MOMENTUM,

13:39.286 --> 13:41.186
STEER AXIS TILT,
AND INERTIA.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.154
SAY WHAT, LITTLE MAN?

13:46.126 --> 13:48.126
IT STAYS UP BY MAGIC.

13:49.129 --> 13:51.029
I KNEW IT!

13:54.100 --> 13:56.201
WHAT WAS THAT?

13:56.203 --> 13:59.103
NOT A BIG FAN OF MAGIC.
YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS ABOUT ME.

14:00.106 --> 14:03.074
LET'S MOVE ON TO
THE HANDS-ON PORTION
OF THE LESSON.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.209
DAD!

14:05.178 --> 14:08.112
- ( bell rings )
- HERE'S YOUR OLD BIKE, BUDDY.

14:10.116 --> 14:12.250
WHY IS MY TRAINING BIKE
SO FEMININE?

14:12.252 --> 14:14.319
IT'S A GENDER-NEUTRAL BIKE.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.287
IT WORKS FOR BOTH
BOYS OR GIRLS.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.223
OH, RIGHT.
I FORGOT.

14:18.225 --> 14:21.292
- WHAT'S WITH THE GIRL BIKE?
- I KNEW IT!

14:24.164 --> 14:27.098
WE SAVED MONEY BY HAVING
YOU ALL LEARN ON LIV'S BIKE.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.366
I REGRET NOTHING.

14:29.803 --> 14:31.135
HOP ON.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.107
HERE'S YOUR
GENDER-NEUTRAL HELMET.

14:37.777 --> 14:39.244
YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT WRONG.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.045
SOME LADYBUGS IS DUDES.

14:45.051 --> 14:47.785
WOW, YOUR FIRST BIKE RIDE.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.087
YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE A PICTURE?

14:49.089 --> 14:50.221
I WOULDN'T ADVISE IT.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.091
NOW, START PEDDLING.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.226
I'M SCARED, LITTLE GUY.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.129
IT'S OKAY.
I'LL GIVE YOU A PUSH.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.297
OKAY.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.301
WHOO.

15:04.204 --> 15:05.303
I'M DOING IT.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.207
I'M DOING IT GOOD, MAN.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.310
YEAH!
UH-OH.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.345
<i>( crashing )</i>

15:15.815 --> 15:17.348
OH, I GOT TO
GET A PICTURE OF THIS.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.083
Dump Truck:
<i>I WOULDN'T ADVISE IT.</i>

15:22.289 --> 15:26.124
ALL RIGHT, A MIGGIE-MOVIE NIGHT
IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.609
I'M GLAD WE GOT
SOME ALONE-TIME.

15:27.610 --> 15:29.093
- <i> ( movie music plays )</i>
- YEAH, ME TOO.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.095
HOW'S THAT LIGHT BULB
COMING, DAD?

15:33.166 --> 15:35.099
ALMOST...

15:35.101 --> 15:38.336
UGH! MISALIGNED.
THIS COULD TAKE ALL NIGHT.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.374
THERE, IT DIDN'T.
NOW GO.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.109
GIVE THESE TWO
SOME PRIVACY.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.378
- THANKS, MOM.
- ANY TIME.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.347
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.182
WHERE WERE WE?

15:51.184 --> 15:53.885
HMM.

15:53.887 --> 15:55.219
( giggles )

15:55.221 --> 15:56.321
( sighs )

15:56.323 --> 15:57.889
I MISSED THIS
WHEN YOU WERE GONE.

15:57.891 --> 15:59.891
THIS IS PERFECT.

16:03.196 --> 16:03.761
( sniffs )

16:07.267 --> 16:09.267
UM...
( clears throat )

16:09.269 --> 16:11.302
SORRY, YOUR <i> HOERSKABUBEN</i>
IS JUST KIND OF LIKE...

16:11.304 --> 16:13.271

16:13.273 --> 16:15.340
- SORRY. THERE WE GO.
- ( forced chuckle )

16:15.342 --> 16:17.275
- WHOO, HA HA.
- ( sighs )

16:17.277 --> 16:19.210
( sighs )

16:20.146 --> 16:21.879
SO WHAT'D YOU MISS MOST
ABOUT STEVENS POINT?

16:21.881 --> 16:24.916
OBVIOUSLY THIS, YOU, US.

16:24.918 --> 16:26.284
OH.
( giggles )

16:26.286 --> 16:27.352
WHAT ELSE?

16:28.288 --> 16:30.254
UM...

16:30.256 --> 16:31.389
DID I SAY "YOU" ALREADY?

16:31.391 --> 16:33.458
( giggles )
COME ON.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.393
- THIS IS YOUR HOMETOWN.
- I KNOW.

16:35.395 --> 16:38.296
IT'S JUST TRAVELING
REALLY CHANGED ME.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.848
EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT NOW.

16:39.849 --> 16:41.399
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO BE A
FOREIGN EXCHANGE STUDENT AGAIN.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.167
( laughs, snorts )

16:43.169 --> 16:44.402
THAT'S FUNNY.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.824
WHAT? YOU'RE SERIOUS?

16:49.825 --> 16:51.475
YEAH, I SIGNED UP
FOR NEXT SEMESTER.

16:51.478 --> 16:52.910
I'M GOING TO AUSTRALIA,

16:52.912 --> 16:55.380
SO YOU CAN CALL ME
"DIGGERIE-DOO. "

16:57.384 --> 17:01.352
( mimicking didgeridoo )

17:01.354 --> 17:04.222
YOU GET IT?
( resumes mimicking )

17:04.224 --> 17:05.923
- I GET IT. ( forced laugh )
- NICE.

17:05.925 --> 17:08.426
BUT WHY WOULD YOU
WANT TO LEAVE AGAIN?

17:09.462 --> 17:11.462
I MEAN, YOU LITERALLY JUST
GOT BACK TO STEVENS POINT.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.331
I KNOW, AND THIS WILL
ALWAYS BE MY HOME.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.932
IT JUST FEELS CONFINING.

17:14.934 --> 17:16.934
IT'S LIKE-- IT'S LIKE
HOW YOU CAN'T FIT

17:16.936 --> 17:18.720
INTO YOUR DESK
FROM KINDERGARTEN.

17:18.721 --> 17:20.505
ONCE YOU'VE OUTGROWN IT,
YOU CAN'T, LIKE, WEDGE
YOUR WAY BACK IN THERE

17:20.507 --> 17:22.206
WITHOUT GETTING AN OWIE.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.410
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

17:25.412 --> 17:27.478
YEAH, I-- YES.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.380
I DEFINITELY KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.
( chuckles )

17:29.382 --> 17:31.983
DON'T WORRY.
WE STILL HAVE A COUPLE MONTHS
BEFORE I GO AWAY.

17:31.985 --> 17:33.351
IT'LL BE AWESOME.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.288
( girlish voice )
SO AWESOME.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.425
( sighs )

17:40.427 --> 17:42.293
SO AWESOME.

17:43.463 --> 17:44.962
BROUGHT SOME SNACKS.

17:44.964 --> 17:48.299
- MOM!
- I JUST WANT
TO BE IN YOUR LIFE!

17:53.306 --> 17:58.309
- ( breathes deeply )
- SO DIGGIE'S GOING
TO AUSTRALIA?

17:58.311 --> 18:00.311
YEP, BUT I'M FINE!

18:01.347 --> 18:04.449
JUST GONNA, YOU KNOW,
WORK IT OUT BY WORKING OUT.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.517
OKAY, SO BEFORE THAT SNAPS
AND TAKES OUT AN EYE...

18:06.519 --> 18:09.353
( chuckles )
MADDIE, WE NEED
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

18:09.355 --> 18:11.556
WHAT IS THERE TO TALK ABOUT?

18:12.992 --> 18:16.461
I THINK THIS COULD BE
AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY
FOR DIGGIE.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.263
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

18:19.265 --> 18:20.398
I MEAN, DO YOU WANT HIM
TO GO AWAY?

18:20.400 --> 18:23.367
NO.
( laughs harshly )
OF COURSE NOT.

18:24.537 --> 18:27.572
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
I WASN'T EVEN A PART
OF THE CONVERSATION.

18:30.276 --> 18:33.411
BUT, I MEAN, WE DID
THE LONG-DISTANCE THING BEFORE,

18:33.413 --> 18:36.414
AND I'M SURE
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN.

18:37.350 --> 18:40.284
YEAH, MADDIE, YOU DID IT,
BUT YOU HATED IT.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.587
I MEAN, FOR MONTHS,
YOU STOPPED BEING MADDIE,

18:42.589 --> 18:44.655
AND YOU STARTED
BEING ALL "SADDIE."

18:46.025 --> 18:48.359
I MEAN,
COME ON, THIS IS DIGGIE
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

18:48.361 --> 18:51.028
HE CARES ABOUT
HOW YOU FEEL.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.030
BUT IF YOU DON'T TELL HIM
HOW YOU FEEL,

18:53.032 --> 18:55.366
HE'S NOT GONNA KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.635
( scoffs )

18:59.072 --> 19:01.038
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.573
I THINK I'M GONNA TELL HIM.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.475
THANKS, LIV.
GREAT TALK.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.577
TALK?
DID I MISS GIRL TALK?

19:06.579 --> 19:10.414
I HAVE BEEN CARRYING
THIS PAN-FLUTE CD AROUND
WITH ME ALL DAY.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.386
THIS IS YOUR FINAL TEST.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.522
PASS AND YOU'LL JOIN IN
ON THE TWO-WHEELED FUN

19:17.524 --> 19:20.658
AND FREEDOM EXPERIENCED
BY SIX-YEAR-OLDS EVERYWHERE.

19:23.429 --> 19:24.562
LET'S DO THIS.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.498
- GO!
- ( horn blares )

19:34.407 --> 19:35.740
THIS IS TOO EASY.

19:35.742 --> 19:38.476
BEWARE OF DOGS.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.511
<i>( barking )</i>

19:40.513 --> 19:42.547
- ( growls, barks )
- <i> ( dog whines )</i>

19:42.549 --> 19:43.781
CAR DOOR!

19:44.717 --> 19:46.784
HEY! I'M BIKING HERE!

19:48.621 --> 19:50.521
OH NO, EXTREME FOG!

19:50.523 --> 19:51.756
( hissing )

19:53.760 --> 19:54.759
REFRESHING.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.696
WATCH OUT FOR
YOUR GREATEST FEAR.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.632
- MAGIC!
- ( screams )

20:05.672 --> 20:07.838
- ( bike bell rings )
- ( cheers )

20:09.542 --> 20:11.609
( clears throat )

20:12.545 --> 20:13.611
I MADE IT.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.652
( giggles )

20:21.654 --> 20:24.689
WOW, LOOK AT US.
JUST TWO GIRLS,

20:24.691 --> 20:26.724
BOUNCING BALLS
AND SHOOTING HOOPS,

20:26.726 --> 20:28.826
OPENING UP
ABOUT FEELINGS,

20:28.828 --> 20:30.861
BUT ONLY IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.664
( whispers )
PLEASE FEEL LIKE IT.

20:36.603 --> 20:39.537
ACTUALLY, MOM.
I KINDA DO FEEL LIKE IT.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.005
THINGS HAVEN'T EXACTLY BEEN

20:41.006 --> 20:42.472
- THE MOST--
- Diggie: <i> HEY, ROONEY.</i>

20:42.475 --> 20:43.541
MRS. ROONEY.

20:43.543 --> 20:44.709
- DIGGIE.
- MOM.

20:44.711 --> 20:45.876
I KNOW.

20:48.514 --> 20:50.581
HI. THANKS FOR COMING OVER.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.783
- WHAT'S UP?
- UM...

20:53.853 --> 20:56.520
I'M REALLY HAPPY

20:56.522 --> 20:58.556
THAT YOU'RE SO EXCITED
ABOUT GOING TO AUSTRALIA.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.224
YEAH, I AM TOO.

21:00.225 --> 21:01.891
- I CAN'T WAIT TO--
- I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY,

21:01.894 --> 21:03.828
REALLY, REALLY
DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.831
WHAT? WHY?

21:07.834 --> 21:12.603
BECAUSE BEING IN
A LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP
WAS REALLY HARD ON US.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.940
I KNOW. IT WAS HARD
FOR ME TOO.

21:17.744 --> 21:20.711
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT GONNA
BE IN HIGH SCHOOL FOREVER,

21:20.713 --> 21:22.847
AND THEN WHO KNOWS
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
AFTER THAT.

21:22.849 --> 21:24.615
EXACTLY!
MADDIE...

21:24.617 --> 21:26.651
THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO JUMP
ON THIS OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW.

21:26.653 --> 21:27.785
WHAT ABOUT ME?

21:30.823 --> 21:32.823
WHAT ABOUT US?

21:32.825 --> 21:34.659
( scoffs )
WHY YOU BEING LIKE THIS?

21:34.661 --> 21:37.762
BECAUSE YOU LEFT ME
FOR EIGHT MONTHS!

21:37.764 --> 21:40.531
AND I WAITED FOR THE DAY THAT
YOU WERE GONNA COME BACK,

21:40.533 --> 21:42.767
AND NOW YOU'RE JUST TELLING ME
THAT YOU'RE TAKING OFF AGAIN?

21:42.769 --> 21:44.769
OKAY, I THOUGH YOU'D BE
A BIT MORE SUPPORTIVE!

21:44.771 --> 21:47.672
I HAVE BEEN SO SUPPORTIVE!
MORE THAN YOU!

21:47.674 --> 21:49.540
THIS ISN'T REALLY MAKING
ME WANT TO STAY, MADDIE.

21:49.542 --> 21:50.675
- THEN GO!
- I WILL!

21:50.677 --> 21:52.743
BUT I CAN'T PROMISE

21:52.745 --> 21:54.879
THAT I'M JUST GONNA
BE WAITING FOR YOU
WHEN YOU GET BACK THIS TIME.

21:54.881 --> 21:55.946
FINE!

21:59.819 --> 22:01.886
MADDIE,
MAYBE WE SHOULD BREAK UP.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.694
WOW.

22:13.733 --> 22:14.965
OKAY.

22:21.708 --> 22:22.807
( breath hitches )

22:26.612 --> 22:27.845
OKAY.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.783
- SEE YOU AROUND, ROONEY.
- YEAH.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.693
( sobs )

22:42.695 --> 22:43.961
MADDIE?

22:43.963 --> 22:45.663
MOM, WE JUST BROKE UP!

22:45.665 --> 22:47.698
- ( cries )
- OH, OH, HONEY.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.600
I'M SO SORRY.

22:49.602 --> 22:51.001
( sobbing )

22:54.741 --> 22:57.942
SO NO HARD FEELINGS, RIGHT?

22:58.945 --> 23:00.811
NONE AT ALL.

23:01.814 --> 23:04.682
AND WE'RE STILL BUDS?

23:05.718 --> 23:06.884
YUP.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.052
GREAT!

23:10.857 --> 23:12.823
QUESTION,
WHY DO I FEEL LIKE

23:12.825 --> 23:15.693
THERE MAY BE A LITTLE BIT
OF HARD FEELINGS?

23:15.695 --> 23:16.794
NOT SURE.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.700
OH NO.

23:23.770 --> 23:24.969
<i>FLUGEL!</i>

23:24.971 --> 23:26.737
( screams )

23:27.974 --> 23:31.675
I DON'T LIKE
<i>FLUGELBALL </i> ANYMORE!

23:31.677 --> 23:32.977
Parker: <i> ZIP YOUR SOUP COOLER.</i>
