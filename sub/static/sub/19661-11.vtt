WEBVTT

00:03.150 --> 00:04.710
- The new horns are driving
people nuts.

00:04.820 --> 00:06.100
- They knew the tracks
were there

00:06.260 --> 00:07.460
when they moved in.

00:07.460 --> 00:09.520
- Next week, Jake's office.

00:09.530 --> 00:12.360
This corned beef sucks.

00:12.360 --> 00:15.200
- Long as we're one step ahead
of the lunatics.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.370
- You mean tax payers.
- Our job is to

00:17.370 --> 00:19.400
move people and goods
from here to there

00:19.400 --> 00:20.640
as cheap as we can.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.400
- At least they're off
the bombers.

00:22.410 --> 00:24.340
- Tell that to Sandy.
She just had "oil sucks"

00:24.340 --> 00:25.470
scratched into her beamer.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.910
- No, no. "Bought by oil."

00:27.910 --> 00:30.710
And they misspelled "bought."

00:30.710 --> 00:33.480
- Excuse me, guys. Is this
the committee on transportation?

00:33.480 --> 00:34.620
- It is.
- I'm looking for

00:34.620 --> 00:36.350
alderman Christopher Jones.

00:36.350 --> 00:37.590
- I tried to stop him, Chris.
- It's okay.

00:37.590 --> 00:39.190
You need me to sign?

00:41.190 --> 00:42.460
- Oil whores!

00:42.460 --> 00:44.630
- What is this?!
- We need some help in here!

00:44.630 --> 00:46.930
- Hey, what are you doing?

00:46.930 --> 00:48.500
- Oh, you bastards.

00:48.500 --> 00:49.930
You're sending poison
into our neighborhoods.

00:49.930 --> 00:52.700
You're killing our kids.
- Call 911!

00:52.700 --> 00:54.940
And have them
take him out the back.

00:54.940 --> 00:57.270
Hell if I give him
any publicity.

00:59.510 --> 01:01.640
You okay?

01:01.650 --> 01:04.250
- Just need some air.

01:42.790 --> 01:44.750
- All right, what did you see?
- I mean, just, bam.

01:44.750 --> 01:47.460
She just blew by.
- What'd she look like?

01:47.460 --> 01:49.590
- Maybe it was a guy?

01:49.590 --> 01:51.790
- You didn't see brake lights?
- Nope.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.730
- Did the driver swerve
to avoid the pedestrian?

01:53.730 --> 01:55.630
- Not that I saw.
- Did the driver stop?

01:55.630 --> 01:57.430
- Definitely not.
- All right.

01:57.430 --> 02:00.240
We have a dark red SUV,
Illinois plates,

02:00.240 --> 02:02.270
last three digits 484.

02:02.270 --> 02:04.410
Can you remember anything else?

02:04.410 --> 02:05.810
- The... the license plate
was one of the special ones

02:05.810 --> 02:07.640
with the lettering on the side.

02:07.640 --> 02:10.509
- Like government plates?
- No, uh, on the right side

02:10.509 --> 02:13.580
there was, um, BP, bf,
something like that.

02:13.580 --> 02:15.720
I... it was hard to see
from my window.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.420
- Thanks. If you remember
anything else.

02:19.790 --> 02:22.320
Hi.
- Hi.

02:22.330 --> 02:24.560
Um, look, I'm sorry
to have to tell you

02:24.560 --> 02:27.600
your hit and run victim,
he didn't make it.

02:27.600 --> 02:31.600
Maybe if somebody had called us
quicker, but anyway.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.370
Here's the report.

02:33.370 --> 02:34.640
- Appreciate it.

02:37.470 --> 02:40.610
- You get anything?
- Nah, not much. You?

02:40.610 --> 02:44.710
- I got nothing but boom
and a flying body.

02:44.710 --> 02:48.020
- The victim, he died.
Christopher Jones.

02:48.020 --> 02:50.750
- You're kidding.
- What?

02:50.750 --> 02:53.390
He's a big deal?
Is that why we got the call?

02:53.390 --> 02:55.320
- He was
alderman Christopher Jones.

02:55.330 --> 02:57.760
Mr. bomb train.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.590
- Was he for or against them?

02:59.600 --> 03:01.400
- Take a guess.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.570
<i>- Two million.</i>

03:13.580 --> 03:14.810
<i>A single train car
full of crude oil</i>

03:14.810 --> 03:16.710
equals two million
sticks of dynamite.

03:16.710 --> 03:19.080
And these bomb trains, they pass
through our back yards,

03:19.080 --> 03:20.750
next to our churches,
our schools.

03:20.750 --> 03:22.550
- You wanna start a petition,
paint a sign,

03:22.550 --> 03:24.590
parade around, that's fine.
- A sign?

03:24.590 --> 03:27.890
160 miles from here, a train car
derailed and exploded

03:27.890 --> 03:29.360
and burned for three days.

03:29.360 --> 03:32.590
So me... ooh... waving a sign
in front of city hall

03:32.600 --> 03:34.330
isn't gonna stop that
from happening

03:34.330 --> 03:37.970
in north lawndale or Cicero
or anywhere else in Chicago.

03:37.970 --> 03:42.000
All it takes is
a leak, a spark, and boom.

03:42.010 --> 03:45.840
- Thus, bomb trains.
- Exactly.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.110
- How else is the oil supposed
to get where it's going?

03:48.110 --> 03:50.110
- It's not.
- Let me guess,

03:50.110 --> 03:53.820
you drive a prius.
- I ride a bicycle.

03:53.820 --> 03:55.980
Everyone should.
We only have one planet.

03:55.990 --> 03:58.990
- And the city's department of
transportation is destroying it?

03:58.990 --> 04:00.860
- They're not saving it.

04:00.860 --> 04:02.090
It's a matter of morality.

04:02.090 --> 04:03.990
- So is murder.
- Please.

04:03.990 --> 04:07.860
The oil that I spilled
was purely symbolic.

04:07.860 --> 04:09.730
It was prune juice and soap.

04:09.730 --> 04:12.030
It wouldn't have caught fire.
- Hm.

04:12.040 --> 04:14.370
And alderman Christopher Jones.

04:14.370 --> 04:16.640
- His face was the one
on the TV.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.870
- Kill the snake
by cutting off his head.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.709
- Something like that.

04:20.709 --> 04:23.880
- Sounds like a confession.
- You want me to be clearer?

04:23.880 --> 04:26.810
I, James t. Sprague,

04:26.820 --> 04:28.880
hereby confess to wanting

04:28.890 --> 04:31.750
to breathe clean air,
to drink clean water...

04:31.760 --> 04:33.990
- by murdering alderman Jones.

04:36.020 --> 04:38.060
- What?
- We know you weren't

04:38.060 --> 04:39.760
the one driving, Jim.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.400
Tell us who was
and we can work something out.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.030
- I... i wouldn't kill someone

04:44.030 --> 04:46.030
and neither would anyone
at eco liberation.

04:50.470 --> 04:54.780
- Last month, they sabotaged the
toilets at uniform oil and gas.

04:54.780 --> 04:56.740
Last week, they chained
themselves to pumps

04:56.750 --> 04:58.910
at a half dozen gas stations.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.120
Today, they killed an alderman.
- Come on.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.750
We don't know that, Bobby.

05:02.750 --> 05:05.190
- Did the driver stop
or call for help?

05:05.190 --> 05:06.790
That's what I thought.

05:06.790 --> 05:09.890
No chance this was an accident.

05:09.890 --> 05:12.660
What about the guy
who poured oil on the table?

05:12.660 --> 05:14.800
- Apparently, it was
some kind of organic goop.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.460
He's been charged
with criminal damage.

05:16.470 --> 05:18.870
- They call themselves
environmentalists.

05:18.870 --> 05:21.000
They don't give a damn
about the environment.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.470
They're anarchists,
is what they are.

05:23.470 --> 05:26.810
First it's Chris,
then it's me, you.

05:26.810 --> 05:31.180
We need to make an example
of these a-holes, mark.

05:31.180 --> 05:34.080
- I promise you, we're gonna
do everything we can.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.520
- Hey, man, you know, thank you.
- Thank you.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.150
- Okay. And you give my best
to your wife.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.860
- I will. Thanks.

05:44.930 --> 05:47.030
What do we have?
- Dawson and nagel

05:47.030 --> 05:48.230
are at eco liberation,

05:48.230 --> 05:50.030
Jim sprague's
environmental group.

05:50.030 --> 05:51.530
- What about the car?

05:51.530 --> 05:53.700
- We have partial
specialty plates.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.770
We're also looking at footage
from traffic cameras,

05:55.770 --> 05:58.710
but there's quite a few
dark red suvs in Chicago.

05:58.710 --> 06:00.780
Our tech guys
are doing the best they can.

06:00.780 --> 06:02.780
- Have 'em do it quickly.

06:07.720 --> 06:09.120
- Come on, you're gonna
arrest us

06:09.120 --> 06:11.850
for conspiracy
to spill prune juice.

06:11.860 --> 06:13.920
- To be precise,
it's criminal damage

06:13.920 --> 06:15.720
to state-supported property.

06:15.730 --> 06:18.860
- Oh, I see. So the conference
table's filing a complaint.

06:18.860 --> 06:20.260
- Hey, I'd watch
the attitude, pal.

06:20.260 --> 06:21.930
Your friend's already
sitting in a cell.

06:21.930 --> 06:23.870
- Only until our attorney
arranges bail.

06:23.870 --> 06:24.970
- You're gonna need
a lot of that.

06:24.970 --> 06:27.030
- For making
a political statement?

06:27.040 --> 06:29.740
- A statement's tossing
a hacky sack at alderman Jones.

06:29.740 --> 06:31.810
- Ooh, look, we had nothing
to do with that.

06:31.810 --> 06:33.570
- But you are opposed
to oil trains.

06:33.580 --> 06:36.510
- Yeah. Just like we're opposed
to killing people.

06:36.510 --> 06:40.750
But this is how we show
our opposition.

06:40.750 --> 06:43.890
We encourage people to write,
and/or call their alderman.

06:43.890 --> 06:45.290
And when that doesn't work?

06:45.290 --> 06:47.760
We spill prune juice.

06:47.760 --> 06:51.230
We wanna win hearts and minds,
not splatter them on the street.

06:51.230 --> 06:54.300
You wanna talk to my people,
be my guest.

06:54.300 --> 06:56.230
- Thank you, we will.

06:56.230 --> 06:57.970
- Just one more question.
- Sure.

06:57.970 --> 06:59.930
- Shouldn't you shut
your lights off?

06:59.940 --> 07:04.610
- Right after I hug a tree.

07:11.910 --> 07:14.250
- Why do these people
give me a headache?

07:14.250 --> 07:16.020
- It's all that co2 in the air.

07:16.020 --> 07:17.220
- Yeah, it's more like
the methane

07:17.220 --> 07:18.990
coming from their mouths.
- Grow up.

07:18.990 --> 07:21.790
They're trying to save us.
- Not you?

07:21.790 --> 07:23.820
- Hey, I like my steak
as rare as the next guy.

07:23.830 --> 07:26.590
I like air conditioning in the
summer and heat in the winter.

07:26.600 --> 07:30.200
But I think there's
a middle ground.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.200
Did you know there are
63 different

07:32.200 --> 07:34.600
specialty plates in Illinois?
- Mm-hmm.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.070
My witness said it was
something like BP or bf.

07:37.070 --> 07:38.210
- Oh, your witness was wrong.

07:38.210 --> 07:39.910
There's no BP or bf.

07:39.910 --> 07:41.310
- Flip it, maybe?

07:41.310 --> 07:45.080
- Nothing. There's a bd,
that's a bears fan.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.950
And a bh, that's the blackhawks.

07:47.950 --> 07:50.220
Hold on. There's a pf.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.220
- Pissed-off feminist?
- Close.

07:52.220 --> 07:55.220
Pet friendly.
- That was my next guess.

07:55.220 --> 07:57.020
- The money raised
from selling those plates

07:57.030 --> 07:59.960
goes to reducing
animal overpopulation.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.230
- It's not a leap someone like
that would be eco-friendly.

08:02.230 --> 08:03.830
- Yeah.
- Look for a plate

08:03.830 --> 08:07.340
with the last three digits 484.

08:07.340 --> 08:09.100
- Ten across the state.
- Well, I doubt

08:09.110 --> 08:10.840
someone in peoria
would be interested

08:10.840 --> 08:12.970
in oil trains in Chicago.

08:12.980 --> 08:15.380
- Uh, there's three in town.

08:15.380 --> 08:20.380
Ms. edna St. James
drives an SUV.

08:20.380 --> 08:21.980
- Those look very nice, ma'am.

08:21.990 --> 08:23.920
- Are you sure
you don't want some?

08:23.920 --> 08:27.090
It's Botan candy from Japan.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.020
- No thank you, listen, we...
- I got it from the web.

08:29.030 --> 08:32.330
Oh, it is amazing what you can
get from the web.

08:32.330 --> 08:34.900
- Mrs. St. James,
we're here about your car.

08:34.900 --> 08:37.900
- Oh, well, you're too late.
Somebody's got it.

08:37.900 --> 08:40.070
- It was stolen?
- I hope not.

08:40.070 --> 08:42.169
I rented it out.

08:42.169 --> 08:44.940
- You rented your car.
- Hm, yeah.

08:44.940 --> 08:50.180
It's called car-a-la-carte.

08:50.180 --> 08:51.980
My Betsy told me about it.

08:51.980 --> 08:55.980
It's an app that lets me
rent my car to strangers.

08:55.990 --> 08:59.950
- Hm.
- It's like uber meets hertz.

09:01.890 --> 09:05.430
- Who was the last person
who rented your car?

09:05.430 --> 09:09.130
- Jane Reynolds
at 8:00 this morning.

09:09.130 --> 09:11.400
She was very polite.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.430
In a hurry, but polite.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.100
Is she okay?

09:15.100 --> 09:17.200
- We don't know.
- I'll call the number.

09:17.210 --> 09:20.170
- Okay. Is there a way
you can track your car?

09:20.180 --> 09:24.950
- I like to spy on them too.

09:24.950 --> 09:28.080
- It's a landline.
I got an answer machine.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.920
- There she is now.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.120
- We're gonna borrow this.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.420
- But my Betsy
bought that for me.

09:32.420 --> 09:34.120
- I promise,
we'll be careful with it.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.960
- But what... when will i...
- Thank you so much.

09:47.300 --> 09:49.470
- Train tracks.
Definite message.

09:49.470 --> 09:51.340
- Is that smoke?

09:59.020 --> 10:00.480
- open it.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.780
Whoa, whoa!

10:02.790 --> 10:05.320
Oops.
- Get out! Both of you.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.220
- Hands up!
- Okay.

10:07.220 --> 10:09.260
Against the car.

10:11.790 --> 10:14.230
- This is the car.
- Hey, it wasn't us, man.

10:14.230 --> 10:16.230
- Wasn't you, what?
- Whatever.

10:17.770 --> 10:19.730
- I'm not surprised
they hit someone.

10:19.740 --> 10:21.170
- Oh, my partner's
being generous.

10:21.170 --> 10:22.800
I'd say killed.

10:22.810 --> 10:27.010
- Killed? No way.
You got the wrong dudes.

10:27.010 --> 10:29.340
- All right.
Move away from the vehicle.

10:29.350 --> 10:30.810
- We found the car
over on Clark.

10:30.810 --> 10:33.250
Keys were inside.
It was just like a joy ride.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.250
- We were gonna bring it back,
I swear.

10:37.150 --> 10:38.390
- Hey, what happened
to the music?

10:38.390 --> 10:40.760
- I synced my phone
to the Bluetooth.

10:40.760 --> 10:45.190
Probably out of range now, duh.

10:45.190 --> 10:47.500
- Maybe Jane synced her phone.

10:49.770 --> 10:51.830
- Okay.

11:01.410 --> 11:04.350
Ronnie, I have a cell phone
I need you to locate.

11:08.350 --> 11:11.290
- Jane Reynolds?
- Where is she?

11:11.290 --> 11:15.860
Oh, no, no, no, no. No, please,
you don't understand.

11:15.860 --> 11:19.190
Leave that alone.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.100
- Oh. You're gonna
have to come with us.

11:21.100 --> 11:24.130
- No, I can't!
They have my daughter!

11:31.870 --> 11:35.040
- The alderman...
It was an accident.

11:35.040 --> 11:38.080
He came out of nowhere.
I'm so sorry.

11:38.080 --> 11:41.080
But the man said if I stopped...
- who?

11:41.080 --> 11:43.820
- Don't you think
I'd tell you if I knew?

11:43.820 --> 11:45.420
- When did you
last see your daughter?

11:45.420 --> 11:48.520
- This morning.
She was excited to go

11:48.520 --> 11:50.890
to the museum with her class.

11:50.890 --> 11:52.460
And now...

11:54.960 --> 11:57.000
<i>Oh.</i>

11:57.000 --> 11:59.930
<i>He told me to rent a car</i>

11:59.940 --> 12:02.400
<i>and go to different banks
and money machines.</i>

12:02.410 --> 12:04.170
<i>He said his partner
was watching me,</i>

12:04.170 --> 12:05.510
<i>that my phone was hacked.</i>

12:05.510 --> 12:07.910
If I sent a text or hung up

12:07.910 --> 12:09.480
or said anything to anyone

12:09.480 --> 12:12.050
that I would never
see Emma again.

12:12.050 --> 12:16.050
I was... i was waiting to pay him
when you arrested me.

12:16.050 --> 12:17.150
- Okay.

12:17.150 --> 12:19.990
All this for eight grand?

12:19.990 --> 12:22.060
- That's all he wanted.

12:22.060 --> 12:26.060
Please.
Don't let them kill her.

12:32.030 --> 12:33.570
- Anyone buying any of this?

12:33.570 --> 12:34.900
- What difference
would it make to the kidnapper

12:34.900 --> 12:36.240
where she got the money?

12:36.240 --> 12:39.210
- And why would he insist
that she rent a car?

12:39.210 --> 12:41.480
Dmv says she has a new Mercedes.

12:41.480 --> 12:44.140
- Did you trace the call?
- It was from a burner phone.

12:44.150 --> 12:47.210
- I got the report. All we could
find on Jane Reynolds.

12:47.220 --> 12:49.520
- Thanks, Billy.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.490
Okay, let's see.

12:52.490 --> 12:55.560
She's divorced. Her ex, Ted,
was a commercial pilot

12:55.560 --> 12:57.560
and for the last few years,
her only source of income

12:57.560 --> 12:59.630
was alimony and child support.

12:59.630 --> 13:02.460
- She didn't hide her identity
when she rented the SUV.

13:02.470 --> 13:04.570
Her cell phone was synced
with that car's system.

13:04.570 --> 13:06.270
Could this have been
an accident?

13:06.270 --> 13:09.100
- Then why not stop?
- She panicked.

13:09.110 --> 13:11.570
Wouldn't be the first.

13:11.570 --> 13:14.240
- Someone should
tell the father.

13:17.580 --> 13:19.250
- You know,
most child abductions

13:19.250 --> 13:21.520
involve the other parent.
- Who grab the kid and run.

13:21.520 --> 13:24.180
They don't ask for ransom.
- You'd think a pilot

13:24.190 --> 13:26.590
would live in a better place.
- Yeah.

13:26.590 --> 13:28.260
- All right.

13:32.190 --> 13:34.090
- Captain Reynolds?

13:34.100 --> 13:36.200
- Not anymore.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.560
- We're from
the state's attorney's office.

13:37.570 --> 13:39.170
We're here about your daughter.

13:39.170 --> 13:41.140
- Emma? Is she okay?

13:41.140 --> 13:43.270
- When's the last time
you saw her?

13:43.270 --> 13:45.170
- What the hell's going on here?
Where's Emma?

13:45.170 --> 13:46.540
- We're attempting
to locate her, sir.

13:46.540 --> 13:48.980
- Locate her? Oh, my god.
What happened?

13:48.980 --> 13:50.510
- She was on a field trip.
- Well, you should be

13:50.510 --> 13:52.510
looking for her.
- The FBI's on it.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.280
They've got agents looking
for any leads they can find.

13:55.280 --> 13:58.220
- Where were you this morning?

13:58.220 --> 14:02.520
- Mopping floors
at western aviation.

14:02.530 --> 14:03.960
Wait, hold on a second,
do you think that

14:03.960 --> 14:05.160
I had something to do with this?

14:05.160 --> 14:06.160
- Why don't you
come back to our office?

14:06.160 --> 14:07.360
We'll talk there.

14:09.630 --> 14:11.100
- Why didn't she call the cops?

14:11.100 --> 14:12.530
- She was ordered not to.

14:14.300 --> 14:16.640
Well, that's the first time
she did what someone told her.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.110
- I hate to ask this,

14:18.110 --> 14:21.740
but has anyone shown
a special interest in Emma?

14:21.740 --> 14:24.110
A neighbor? A friend?
- I... no... i don't know

14:24.110 --> 14:25.310
who her friends are.

14:25.310 --> 14:27.280
- Because he's never there
for Emma.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.120
- Why's that?
- This isn't about him.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.320
This is about her. Why aren't
you out there looking for her?

14:32.320 --> 14:34.190
- Jane, I'm asking you.

14:38.290 --> 14:40.360
Because it's always about him.

14:40.360 --> 14:43.130
Ask him where he was
for Emma's last two birthdays.

14:43.130 --> 14:44.730
- A pipe broke in the hangar.

14:44.730 --> 14:47.000
And if I don't fix it,
I get fired.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.070
Which means I miss
a child support payment.

14:49.070 --> 14:52.140
Which means
I can't see my daughter.

14:52.140 --> 14:54.170
- Been there.

14:54.180 --> 14:58.010
- My daughter...

14:58.010 --> 15:02.120
You know, one day,
when we were still a family,

15:02.120 --> 15:04.180
we went to Navy pier.

15:04.190 --> 15:06.320
When we first got there,
Emma was begging us

15:06.320 --> 15:08.690
for this rainbow kite.

15:08.690 --> 15:10.560
So while they finished lunch,
I told them

15:10.560 --> 15:12.560
I forgot something in the car
and I went back and I bought it.

15:12.560 --> 15:16.300
And when I came back, they were
looking out at the lake.

15:16.300 --> 15:19.700
Their backs were to me.
And I realized that...

15:19.700 --> 15:21.770
That a little girl
in a pink jacket

15:21.770 --> 15:23.370
and a beautiful woman
in a red one

15:23.370 --> 15:27.740
were the only things
that mattered.

15:27.740 --> 15:30.780
And Emma came up to me.
She put her arms around my neck

15:30.780 --> 15:35.080
and she said, "daddy, this is
the best day I've ever had."

15:37.220 --> 15:41.160
You... why else
would a man work four jobs?

15:43.660 --> 15:45.730
Is your ex a good mother?

15:48.330 --> 15:50.360
She's an excellent mother.

15:50.370 --> 15:52.800
And she can afford to be.

15:52.800 --> 15:56.170
I pay for it.
- We have a divorce agreement.

15:56.170 --> 15:57.470
It's fair.

16:00.610 --> 16:02.280
He wasn't always like this.

16:02.280 --> 16:06.380
You know, crazy, I mean.
Vindictive.

16:08.780 --> 16:12.650
We met in college.
In history class.

16:12.660 --> 16:15.320
I asked him to coffee
and we'd been together until...

16:15.320 --> 16:17.390
- I was sucker punched
by the whole thing.

16:17.390 --> 16:19.090
I'm telling you,
it came out of the blue.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.460
I thought I was
happily married...

16:20.460 --> 16:23.700
- but he always
chose work over us.

16:33.440 --> 16:35.680
- Remind me,
why do people get married?

16:35.680 --> 16:39.250
- Hey, guys.
Meet Emma Reynolds.

16:39.250 --> 16:42.250
She was at the museum
with her class the entire time.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.160
- So no one was kidnapped?

16:51.160 --> 16:52.760
- It's called
virtual kidnapping.

16:52.760 --> 16:57.230
- Unfortunately for Chris Jones,
the funeral will be real.

16:57.230 --> 16:58.770
- It's the newest Internet scam.

16:58.770 --> 17:01.240
No Nigerian prince,
no IRS audit.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.800
- People are open books
on the net.

17:02.810 --> 17:04.540
Everything from their credit
card numbers to their weight.

17:04.540 --> 17:06.339
- Their kids names,
their school.

17:06.339 --> 17:08.910
- Whatever happened
to working for a living?

17:08.910 --> 17:11.910
- There are two victims here.
- Anna, I don't want to hear

17:11.910 --> 17:14.349
a dissertation
on moral equivalency, all right?

17:14.349 --> 17:16.319
- There is no equivalence.

17:16.319 --> 17:17.619
Someone wanted
to hurt Mrs. Reynolds.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.890
She wanted to save her daughter.

17:21.790 --> 17:24.530
- What if someone told you they
had one of your grandchildren?

17:24.530 --> 17:26.890
- I'd call the FBI.

17:26.900 --> 17:28.860
And if I ran someone down
on the way there,

17:28.860 --> 17:30.400
I'd call the cops.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.930
So charge this woman
with reckless homicide

17:32.940 --> 17:34.600
and leaving the scene
and let's be done with it.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.640
- A quiet donut.
- What?

17:37.640 --> 17:39.570
- Aqd. Ad quod damnum.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.310
Each person should only
be punished

17:41.310 --> 17:44.310
for the harm they cause.

17:44.310 --> 17:46.680
A quiet donut was my professor's
trick to remember it.

17:49.420 --> 17:54.420
- First, I went
to law school too.

17:54.420 --> 17:57.320
And second,
this woman ran down an alderman,

17:57.330 --> 17:58.960
and that's pretty
damned harmful.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.360
- But she was trying to save
her ten-year-old daughter.

18:01.360 --> 18:05.300
- Who was probably
out of her skull with boredom

18:05.300 --> 18:07.940
as her class
was going to the museum.

18:07.940 --> 18:09.540
Charge her.

18:09.540 --> 18:11.270
The more, the better.

18:15.310 --> 18:17.680
Okay.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.650
You think I'm heartless.

18:19.650 --> 18:23.850
- I think we have different
ideas about justice.

18:23.850 --> 18:28.260
- Fine. You catch and convict
the bastard who called her,

18:28.260 --> 18:30.990
and if you're successful,

18:30.990 --> 18:33.660
I'll consider
offering her probations.

18:37.500 --> 18:41.400
- Emma's with her father.
- Ohh. Can I see her?

18:41.400 --> 18:43.670
- You'll be our guest until...
- Oh, you don't believe me.

18:43.670 --> 18:45.610
- Unfortunately,
it's not our call.

18:45.610 --> 18:46.610
You have to see it from
the state's attorney's

18:46.610 --> 18:49.310
point of view,
Mrs. Reynolds.

18:49.310 --> 18:50.680
- Look, it's hard to understand
someone making you

18:50.680 --> 18:52.350
jump through all those hoops.

18:52.350 --> 18:54.010
The rental car, the four atms.

18:54.020 --> 18:56.520
I'm not even sure
I understand it.

18:56.520 --> 18:59.490
- Who knew Emma was on that
field trip today?

18:59.490 --> 19:03.720
- Ted and me.
Her classmates, their parents.

19:03.730 --> 19:05.730
You think it was someone I know?

19:05.730 --> 19:09.900
- Think hard. Try to place the
voice on the phone with a name.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.030
- It was distorted.

19:12.030 --> 19:14.740
Wait.

19:14.740 --> 19:18.370
He called my house first.

19:18.370 --> 19:19.670
I answered after
the machine picked up.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.680
There might be a message.

19:25.050 --> 19:27.280
- Divorce sure suits her.

19:27.280 --> 19:30.980
- Her ex, not so much.

19:30.990 --> 19:34.920
- Let me ask, you still have
photos of your ex in your house?

19:34.920 --> 19:38.930
- With the kids, yeah.
- Me too.

19:38.930 --> 19:41.430
Looks like Jane erased Ted
from her life.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.400
- The one he pays for.

19:43.400 --> 19:47.070
- Get over it, will you?
We all got issues.

19:47.070 --> 19:50.400
If Jane did get this call,
why didn't she do anything?

19:50.410 --> 19:53.310
I mean, call the cops,
hand someone a note.

19:53.310 --> 19:55.340
I don't know, send a text.
- Are you kidding?

19:55.340 --> 19:57.610
Because the guy who had her kid
said not to.

19:57.610 --> 20:00.410
When that dirt bag took Diego,
I couldn't think straight.

20:00.420 --> 20:02.750
All that mattered
was getting him back.

20:02.750 --> 20:04.420
You don't ask why.
You don't ask questions.

20:04.420 --> 20:07.020
You just do what
they tell you to.

20:14.100 --> 20:15.530
- It's over here.

20:20.040 --> 20:23.000
<i>- You have one old message.</i>

20:23.010 --> 20:24.540
<i>Mrs. Reynolds, get in your car.</i>

20:24.540 --> 20:28.410
<i>- Who is this?
- I'll call your cell.</i>

20:28.410 --> 20:31.410
<i>Do everything I tell you.
We're watching you.</i>

20:33.080 --> 20:35.350
- Why would darth vader
need eight grand?

20:38.520 --> 20:41.120
- Her computer, her kid's,
both their cells...

20:41.120 --> 20:42.560
All completely clean,

20:42.560 --> 20:45.460
aside from your basic
spam and cookies.

20:45.460 --> 20:47.560
- Can you at least unscramble
the voice on the tape?

20:47.560 --> 20:49.600
- This guy isn't Thomas Edison.

20:49.600 --> 20:52.630
He used a $10 app called...
Appropriately enough...

20:52.630 --> 20:56.070
Scramble me, to lower the pitch
of his voice.

20:56.070 --> 20:57.640
- Can you raise it to normal?

20:57.640 --> 21:00.540
- Already done.
I've eliminated Mrs. Reynolds

21:00.540 --> 21:02.140
for your listening pleasure.

21:02.140 --> 21:03.480
<i>Mrs. Reynolds, get in your car</i>

21:03.480 --> 21:04.510
<i>and start driving.</i>

21:04.510 --> 21:05.610
<i>I'll call your cell.</i>

21:05.610 --> 21:07.110
<i>Do everything I tell you.</i>

21:07.120 --> 21:09.480
<i>We're watching you.</i>

21:09.490 --> 21:10.550
<i>Mrs. Reynolds, get in your car</i>

21:10.550 --> 21:12.050
<i>and start driving.</i>

21:12.050 --> 21:13.390
<i>I'll call your cell.</i>

21:13.390 --> 21:14.650
<i>Do everything I tell you.</i>

21:14.660 --> 21:16.760
<i>We're watching you.</i>

21:16.760 --> 21:17.860
- You kidding me?

21:20.430 --> 21:22.500
- Her husband?
- He knew Emma

21:22.500 --> 21:24.030
was on a class field trip.

21:24.030 --> 21:26.170
- He has motive.
- Which is?

21:26.170 --> 21:27.600
- She lives in Lincoln park.

21:27.600 --> 21:28.870
He works four
jobs to pay for it.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.600
- And resents every penny.

21:30.610 --> 21:32.670
- Unfortunately,
after researching it,

21:32.670 --> 21:35.180
what he did only adds up
to intimidation.

21:35.180 --> 21:38.040
- Yeah. A class 3 felony.

21:38.050 --> 21:39.610
- Even then, we have to prove

21:39.620 --> 21:40.750
he threatened
their daughter's safety

21:40.750 --> 21:42.480
to money from his ex-wife.

21:42.480 --> 21:45.450
I can't imagine he'd do
more than a year.

21:45.450 --> 21:46.890
- That's a joke.

21:46.890 --> 21:49.790
Wondering if you're ever
gonna see your kid again,

21:49.790 --> 21:51.190
nothing's more painful.

21:51.190 --> 21:53.530
This guy should be
drawn and quartered.

21:53.530 --> 21:56.060
- Chris's mother
doesn't have to wonder.

21:56.060 --> 22:00.070
She knows she'll never
see Chris again.

22:00.070 --> 22:02.670
- Arrest him.
- For what? Intimidation?

22:02.670 --> 22:05.740
- No. For the murder
of alderman Christopher Jones.

22:05.740 --> 22:08.440
He was killed during
the commission of a felony.

22:08.440 --> 22:09.880
That triggers
the felony murder rule.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.680
- Only if
the defendant committed

22:11.680 --> 22:13.480
one of the predicate felonies.

22:13.480 --> 22:16.180
- One of which is kidnapping.
- Kidnapping.

22:16.190 --> 22:17.750
Not virtual kidnapping.

22:17.750 --> 22:20.220
- The statute doesn't
make that distinction.

22:37.910 --> 22:39.940
- Emma and I were
just having dinner.

22:39.940 --> 22:42.880
- Good. 'Cause the food
at cook county sucks.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.640
- In other words,
you're under arrest

22:44.650 --> 22:48.750
for the murder
of alderman Christopher Jones.

22:48.750 --> 22:51.590
- Jane, right?
What did she tell you?

22:51.590 --> 22:53.950
- Daddy, can we have ice cream?

22:53.960 --> 22:56.120
- Yeah, sweetie.
Just a second.

22:56.120 --> 22:58.730
Look, I'm not
leaving Emma, okay?

22:58.730 --> 23:00.860
- There are two ways
this can go down, Mr. Reynolds.

23:00.860 --> 23:02.560
The first is you come with us
without a fuss

23:02.560 --> 23:04.730
and you let this
nice social worker

23:04.730 --> 23:06.800
sit with Emma while she
finishes her dinner.

23:06.800 --> 23:09.840
The second, your ten-year-old
watches us drag daddy out,

23:09.840 --> 23:11.570
kicking and screaming.

23:16.540 --> 23:19.280
- Uh, Emma, I have to
go out for a second.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.620
But daddy's friend...
- Helen.

23:21.620 --> 23:23.850
- Helen is gonna sit
with you for a minute, okay?

23:29.790 --> 23:31.930
I'll be right back, sweetie.

23:34.700 --> 23:36.300
- It's a good choice.

23:36.300 --> 23:38.770
- In case you're interested,
anything you say or do

23:38.770 --> 23:41.640
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

23:45.710 --> 23:48.780
- My dad used to say, "marriage
isn't a word, young lady",

23:48.780 --> 23:51.580
it's a sentence."

23:51.580 --> 23:53.280
He had a way with words.

23:53.280 --> 23:56.180
Sometimes I think he stayed
with my mom just because

23:56.180 --> 24:00.720
it would've been
too expensive to leave.

24:00.720 --> 24:03.890
- I expect that's an excuse
used by a lot of people.

24:03.890 --> 24:07.560
It's just rationalization.
- For what?

24:07.560 --> 24:10.800
- Fear, inertia, love.

24:14.800 --> 24:17.570
- What about you?
Do you wanna get married?

24:17.570 --> 24:19.010
- I'd like to
finish my dinner first.

24:21.680 --> 24:23.910
- Peter stone?
- That's right.

24:23.910 --> 24:26.680
- Holly Washington,
public defender's office.

24:26.680 --> 24:28.350
I'll be representing
Ted Reynolds.

24:28.350 --> 24:30.280
Do you mind if I sit?
These shoes.

24:30.290 --> 24:32.050
You don't wanna know.
- I don't cut deals

24:32.050 --> 24:34.590
during dinner.
- I heard that about you.

24:34.590 --> 24:36.890
Nope, no deal wanted here.

24:36.890 --> 24:38.990
- I'd ask you to join us, but...
- Oh, I appreciate that.

24:38.990 --> 24:41.860
But I'm on the caveman.
- Excuse me?

24:41.860 --> 24:43.660
- It's a diet.

24:43.670 --> 24:45.700
- Listen, I don't wanna
disturb you.

24:45.700 --> 24:49.370
I just wanna drop this off,
go home, and burn my shoes.

24:49.370 --> 24:52.040
- Hm, a motion to dismiss.

24:52.040 --> 24:55.340
- Felony murder?
I have to admit,

24:55.340 --> 24:57.940
it made me chuckle.

24:57.950 --> 24:59.380
Gotta scoot.

24:59.380 --> 25:00.380
See you in court.

25:04.850 --> 25:07.290
- You had to expect this.

25:07.290 --> 25:09.120
- Not this quickly, I didn't.

25:13.890 --> 25:16.330
- The statute is clear,
your honor.

25:16.330 --> 25:17.960
For the felony murder rule
to kick in,

25:17.970 --> 25:20.270
someone has to have died
while the defendant

25:20.270 --> 25:22.640
is committing
an enumerated felony

25:22.640 --> 25:25.410
such as rape, armed robbery...
- kidnapping.

25:25.410 --> 25:27.710
- Thank you, Mr. stone.
That was next on my list.

25:27.710 --> 25:29.340
Nowhere in the indictment,

25:29.340 --> 25:31.780
was it alleged
that anyone was taken.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.410
- The defendant led his former
wife to believe

25:33.420 --> 25:35.350
that he was
holding their daughter.

25:35.350 --> 25:37.650
- She was on a class trip.
- It's what current literature

25:37.650 --> 25:39.850
calls a virtual kidnapping.
- Oh, great.

25:39.860 --> 25:42.320
So let's strap my client
to a virtual whipping post

25:42.320 --> 25:44.760
and call it a day.
- In any event,

25:44.760 --> 25:45.990
the people aren't alleging

25:45.990 --> 25:48.030
kidnapping is
the predicate felony.

25:48.030 --> 25:52.430
- If I may be so bold,
what are the people alleging?

25:52.430 --> 25:54.870
- Intimidation.
The defendant threatened

25:54.870 --> 25:56.440
to inflict bodily injury
to his daughter

25:56.440 --> 25:59.040
if his former wife failed
to pay him a sum of money.

25:59.040 --> 26:01.310
While racing to get
the requested cash,

26:01.310 --> 26:04.110
his ex-wife struck and killed
alderman Jones.

26:04.110 --> 26:07.050
- Ergo, felony murder.
- I hate to be repetitive,

26:07.050 --> 26:10.980
but nowhere in the statute is
intimidation deemed sufficient

26:10.990 --> 26:12.920
to trigger
the felony murder rule.

26:12.920 --> 26:15.360
- The statute is illustrative,
not exhausted.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.960
It specifies that any felony
involving a threat

26:17.960 --> 26:20.430
of physical force will
trigger the rule.

26:20.430 --> 26:22.400
Ted Reynolds threatened
to harm his daughter

26:22.400 --> 26:23.830
and but/for that threat,

26:23.830 --> 26:25.370
alderman Jones
would still be alive.

26:25.370 --> 26:28.070
- He made a phony phone call,
for crying out loud.

26:28.070 --> 26:30.440
- It was inherently dangerous
behavior.

26:30.440 --> 26:32.710
- It's a barbaric expansion
of the law.

26:32.710 --> 26:34.440
Let's not forget about intent.

26:34.440 --> 26:37.080
If you accept the people's
interpretation of the law,

26:37.080 --> 26:39.710
you are criminalizing
an ordinary accident.

26:39.720 --> 26:41.380
- No, the court would be
deterring would-be criminals

26:41.380 --> 26:43.850
from committing crimes
that unwittingly might lead

26:43.850 --> 26:46.490
to another's death.

26:46.490 --> 26:49.360
- You took the words
out of my mouth, Mr. stone.

26:49.360 --> 26:52.030
The defendant's motion
to dismiss is denied.

26:52.030 --> 26:53.930
Next.

27:01.500 --> 27:02.840
- I always thought
judge Stratton

27:02.840 --> 27:05.740
was one of the smarter judges.

27:05.740 --> 27:07.370
- Peter made
a hell of an argument.

27:07.380 --> 27:10.980
- I'd call that bootstrapping.

27:10.980 --> 27:13.950
And that's only because
we're in mixed company.

27:13.950 --> 27:16.520
In order to win
a felony murder charge,

27:16.520 --> 27:18.180
you have to prove intimidation.

27:18.190 --> 27:20.820
In order to prove intimidation,
you have to establish

27:20.820 --> 27:24.090
a threat to cause
physical injury.

27:24.090 --> 27:26.190
I listened to the tape.

27:26.190 --> 27:29.200
The threat was implied.

27:29.200 --> 27:33.070
And that's more bootstrapping.

27:33.070 --> 27:36.540
Silly me, I read the statute
and I actually believe

27:36.540 --> 27:39.110
it means what it says.

27:41.480 --> 27:44.780
Hit the lights when you leave.

27:51.120 --> 27:54.550
<i>Get in your car
and start driving.</i>

27:54.560 --> 27:55.790
<i>I'll call your cell.</i>

27:55.790 --> 27:56.790
<i>Do everything I tell you.</i>

27:56.790 --> 27:58.220
<i>We're watching you.</i>

27:58.230 --> 27:59.490
- So what I did was
I hacked the app

27:59.490 --> 28:01.230
the defendant used.
- Objection!

28:01.230 --> 28:03.530
- Sustained.

28:03.530 --> 28:06.470
- I hacked the app the caller
used to distort his voice

28:06.470 --> 28:08.500
and reversed the process.

28:08.500 --> 28:10.240
- Who's voice is that?

28:10.240 --> 28:13.440
- In my opinion,
it's the defendant's.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.280
- What makes you say that?

28:15.280 --> 28:18.080
- I ran both the tape from Mrs.
Reynolds' answering machine

28:18.080 --> 28:19.510
and the recording from
the defendant's interview

28:19.510 --> 28:22.250
with state's attorney
investigator Dawson

28:22.250 --> 28:24.580
through software
that compares vocal patterns,

28:24.590 --> 28:28.290
pitch, intonation, et cetera.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.120
- And what'd you find?

28:30.130 --> 28:35.230
- It's the same person's voice
in both tapes.

28:35.230 --> 28:38.260
- Did you know that Mr. Reynolds
met Mrs. Reynolds

28:38.270 --> 28:42.470
back in college, 15 years ago?
- No.

28:42.470 --> 28:45.210
- Do you think it's odd
that someone who

28:45.210 --> 28:49.140
knew the defendant that long
couldn't recognize his voice?

28:49.140 --> 28:52.550
- Well, he used an app to lower
his voice by two octaves.

28:52.550 --> 28:55.180
I was able to raise it by two
octaves and restore it.

28:55.180 --> 28:57.620
- Restore it. How do you know
what you're restoring

28:57.620 --> 29:01.120
if you don't know what
the original sounded like?

29:01.120 --> 29:06.290
I mean, could you have raised
it three octaves?

29:06.290 --> 29:08.190
- Uh, technically, yes.

29:08.200 --> 29:11.300
- I would've sounded
like a different person?

29:11.300 --> 29:14.070
- It would.
- Mm.

29:14.070 --> 29:16.340
Can you play the part
of that recording

29:16.340 --> 29:19.610
where the caller threatened
to mail Mrs. Reynolds' daughter

29:19.610 --> 29:21.370
back to her in pieces

29:21.380 --> 29:23.180
if she didn't follow orders?

29:23.180 --> 29:24.610
- I'm sorry?

29:24.610 --> 29:27.450
- This case hinges
on the question

29:27.450 --> 29:31.580
of whether the caller threatened
Mrs. Reynolds or her daughter.

29:31.590 --> 29:35.220
Please play the recorded threat.

29:35.220 --> 29:38.120
- There isn't one.
- I see. Okay.

29:38.130 --> 29:42.400
Play the part where
the caller spoke about Emma.

29:42.400 --> 29:44.260
- I played everything
that there was.

29:44.270 --> 29:46.570
- So I see, tell me,
what are we doing here?

29:46.570 --> 29:48.200
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.670
I don't have anything else.

29:55.140 --> 29:58.180
- No, I had no idea
it was Ted on the phone.

29:58.180 --> 30:00.480
All I knew was that
I had to do what he said.

30:00.480 --> 30:02.280
- Why is that?

30:02.280 --> 30:07.290
- He said he was going
to hurt Emma, my daughter.

30:07.290 --> 30:10.090
- We just listened
to the tape of the call,

30:10.090 --> 30:13.290
Mrs. Reynolds, and I didn't
hear anything about Emma.

30:13.300 --> 30:15.360
- Called me on my cell
when I was in the car

30:15.360 --> 30:16.930
like he said he would.

30:16.930 --> 30:19.530
That's when he said
that he would hurt her

30:19.530 --> 30:22.500
if I didn't follow his
instructions exactly.

30:22.500 --> 30:27.240
- Hurt her, how?
- He'd cut her throat.

30:27.240 --> 30:30.180
- And you believed him.

30:30.180 --> 30:32.350
- I couldn't afford not to.

30:32.350 --> 30:34.210
- What did he tell you to do?

30:37.480 --> 30:40.520
- First, he wanted me
to rent a car

30:40.520 --> 30:43.360
from something called
car-a-la-carte

30:43.360 --> 30:45.220
and then go to my bank...
My local branch...

30:45.230 --> 30:47.490
And withdraw $2,000.

30:47.500 --> 30:50.960
Then to the branch in kenwood
and do the same.

30:50.970 --> 30:52.670
Then the one in old Irving park.

30:52.670 --> 30:55.540
Then an atm at a 7-Eleven

30:55.540 --> 30:58.670
downtown on kinzie street.

30:58.670 --> 31:00.440
- You were with him on the phone
the entire time.

31:00.440 --> 31:02.610
- Yes.

31:02.610 --> 31:05.710
He said I was being followed

31:05.710 --> 31:09.520
and that if I didn't do
exactly what he said,

31:09.520 --> 31:12.720
that I'd be sorry.

31:12.720 --> 31:14.650
- After you took the money
from the atm,

31:14.660 --> 31:18.560
what did you do?
- I drove as fast as I could.

31:18.560 --> 31:23.400
- What, then, if anything,
happened next?

31:23.400 --> 31:28.300
- Alderman Jones crossed
the street in front of me.

31:28.300 --> 31:32.310
I hit him. I'm so sorry.

31:32.310 --> 31:34.570
- Did you stop
after you hit him?

31:34.580 --> 31:36.710
- No.
- Dial 911?

31:36.710 --> 31:40.250
- I couldn't. He...

31:40.250 --> 31:44.220
He said if I hung up
that he'd kill Emma.

31:44.220 --> 31:46.590
I feel terrible
about what happened,

31:46.590 --> 31:49.790
but I was trying
to save my daughter.

31:49.790 --> 31:53.730
There were other people there;
I knew someone would call.

31:53.730 --> 31:56.330
- No further questions.

32:00.700 --> 32:06.610
- Before you divorced, did you
ever argue with your husband?

32:06.610 --> 32:08.710
- I guess.
- No need to be polite,

32:08.710 --> 32:12.350
now, Mrs. Reynolds.

32:12.350 --> 32:14.780
- Yes, we argued.

32:14.780 --> 32:18.320
- Did he ever threaten
to hurt you?

32:18.320 --> 32:19.550
- I don't remember.

32:19.550 --> 32:21.620
- Let me refresh
your recollection.

32:21.620 --> 32:25.590
I direct you
to defense exhibit 5a.

32:25.590 --> 32:29.060
This is a copy
of the petition you filed

32:29.060 --> 32:30.700
in your divorce proceeding.

32:30.700 --> 32:32.670
Could you turn to page 23

32:32.670 --> 32:36.370
and read
the highlighted portion?

32:36.370 --> 32:39.710
- "Paragraph 14.
On December 13th,

32:39.710 --> 32:43.780
respondent threatened to break
petitioner's leg."

32:43.780 --> 32:46.510
- Now on page 31.

32:46.510 --> 32:50.820
- "Paragraph 22. On January 5th,
respondent threatened

32:50.820 --> 32:53.490
to throw boiling water
on the petitioner."

32:53.490 --> 32:55.090
- Do you remember
making those statements?

32:55.090 --> 32:56.760
- Yes.
- Do you remember swearing

32:56.760 --> 32:59.790
under penalty of perjury

32:59.790 --> 33:02.330
that they were
true and accurate?

33:02.330 --> 33:06.630
- Yes.
- Do you recognize this?

33:06.630 --> 33:08.730
- It's a motion document.
- For what?

33:08.740 --> 33:12.740
- To withdraw paragraphs
14 and 22 of the complaint.

33:12.740 --> 33:14.810
- The two paragraphs
you just read.

33:14.810 --> 33:17.310
- Yes.

33:17.310 --> 33:20.410
- So he never threatened you.

33:20.420 --> 33:23.420
- It was part of the settlement.

33:23.420 --> 33:27.520
- Or to get what you want,
you made unfounded allegations

33:27.520 --> 33:28.820
against my client.
- Objection.

33:28.820 --> 33:31.760
- Withdrawn.
True or false, Mrs. Reynolds,

33:31.760 --> 33:34.630
nobody in the world but you
heard your husband

33:34.630 --> 33:36.530
make those alleged threats
while you were

33:36.530 --> 33:38.630
driving like a maniac
around the city.

33:38.630 --> 33:40.830
- He said he'd hurt Emma.

33:40.840 --> 33:43.540
- Did he really?
Nothing further.

33:48.740 --> 33:51.810
- The people rest.
- So does the defense.

33:55.850 --> 33:57.780
- You know what
her closing argument was?

33:57.790 --> 33:59.850
Essentially the opposite
of my closing argument.

33:59.850 --> 34:02.320
She didn't even put on a case.

34:02.320 --> 34:04.690
- She didn't have to.
You didn't have one.

34:04.690 --> 34:06.730
- Yeah, but four days
deliberation?

34:06.730 --> 34:09.500
- How many divorced fathers
are on the jury?

34:09.500 --> 34:11.360
Two.

34:11.370 --> 34:14.199
You're lucky I'm not an
"I told you so" kinda guy.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.670
- Your honor,
we are still deadlocked.

34:19.670 --> 34:24.739
- Would further deliberation
make a difference?

34:24.750 --> 34:26.880
- I don't believe so.

34:26.880 --> 34:29.780
- Well then,
I'm left with no choice

34:29.780 --> 34:33.750
but to declare a mistrial.

34:33.760 --> 34:35.719
- The people of
the state of Illinois

34:35.719 --> 34:38.190
thank you for your service.

34:41.429 --> 34:43.860
Excuse me. Just so you know,
this isn't over.

34:43.870 --> 34:45.900
I'll be filing for a retrial.

35:00.880 --> 35:03.780
- The jury in the Ted Reynolds
case was deadlocked

35:03.790 --> 35:04.880
because he never
actually said he'd hurt Emma

35:04.890 --> 35:05.950
on the answering machine tape.

35:05.950 --> 35:07.220
- And that's it.

35:07.220 --> 35:08.820
- That's the real felony.

35:08.820 --> 35:10.720
- What about Jane?
- Jeffries wants us

35:10.730 --> 35:13.830
to charge her with reckless
homicide and leaving the scene.

35:13.830 --> 35:16.900
- Stone's good with that?
- He says he'll retry Ted.

35:16.900 --> 35:18.430
- But you don't think
it's worth it.

35:18.430 --> 35:21.930
- Unless he confesses,
I doubt anything'll change.

35:21.940 --> 35:25.840
- You know, we never
talked to Emma.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.440
- You think Ted would actually
threaten Jane

35:27.440 --> 35:29.710
in front of their ten-year-old?

35:29.710 --> 35:33.280
- When it got going in my house,
I'd pretend to be asleep.

35:33.280 --> 35:35.250
But I heard every word.

35:35.250 --> 35:37.320
- Would it help?

35:37.320 --> 35:38.550
- It might.

35:41.820 --> 35:43.720
- I have a little girl
about your age.

35:43.730 --> 35:45.460
Her name's Jen.

35:45.460 --> 35:48.890
She lives with her daddy,
like you.

35:48.900 --> 35:51.460
Jen's daddy and I,
we decided it was best for her

35:51.470 --> 35:53.430
if we didn't all live together.

35:53.430 --> 35:57.000
- Did you fight?
- We did.

35:57.010 --> 35:59.910
- Why? Did your parents
fight a lot?

35:59.910 --> 36:01.940
- No.

36:01.940 --> 36:03.910
- They didn't yell
at one another?

36:03.910 --> 36:06.750
- Well, sometimes they did.
But my mom said

36:06.750 --> 36:08.880
that they didn't mean it.

36:08.880 --> 36:11.520
- Mm. Did that scare you?

36:13.520 --> 36:15.320
You can tell me, Emma.

36:15.320 --> 36:16.860
- Sometimes.

36:20.290 --> 36:21.490
- What was the worst part

36:21.500 --> 36:24.330
about your parents
being divorced?

36:24.330 --> 36:27.000
- Not having all my stuff
in one place.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.040
Some of it's at my dad's house.

36:29.040 --> 36:31.600
I never know where anything is.

36:31.610 --> 36:33.610
- Yeah. That's what Jen says.

36:37.480 --> 36:41.580
When I heard
my parents yell at one another,

36:41.580 --> 36:43.420
that was scary.

36:43.420 --> 36:46.050
I hid in the attic.

36:46.050 --> 36:48.820
It was filthy and there
were spiders.

36:48.820 --> 36:51.790
- I hate spiders.
- But the spiders and the dirt

36:51.790 --> 36:54.930
were better than
hearing them fight.

36:54.930 --> 36:58.100
One time, I heard my dad say
he was gonna hit my mom.

36:58.100 --> 37:00.070
- My dad would never hit my mom

37:00.070 --> 37:02.370
because he loves her.

37:02.370 --> 37:05.940
And people who love each other,
they don't hit.

37:13.010 --> 37:17.350
- Can I get one? Hey.
- Hey.

37:17.350 --> 37:19.950
So, what'd you find out?

37:19.950 --> 37:22.050
- Kid paints
a rosy picture of them.

37:22.060 --> 37:24.360
Nagel was good.
I mean, she's always good

37:24.360 --> 37:27.530
but there's something
about moms.

37:27.530 --> 37:29.100
- Emma never heard them fight?

37:29.100 --> 37:30.530
- She thinks
they love each other.

37:31.930 --> 37:34.100
Kids see what they want.

37:34.100 --> 37:36.400
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

37:36.400 --> 37:38.940
- Yeah, I guess.

37:38.940 --> 37:43.080
You know, a couple weeks ago,
I'm walking down Michigan.

37:43.080 --> 37:45.140
I see Michael Jordan getting
into a limo.

37:45.150 --> 37:47.950
First thing that pops into my
head is I gotta tell my ex.

37:47.950 --> 37:51.550
'Cause she worshipped Michael.
It's weird, huh?

37:51.550 --> 37:53.550
I don't know what it is.

37:53.550 --> 37:55.520
We can't be in a room
ten minutes,

37:55.520 --> 37:57.960
but somewhere
in the back of my head,

37:57.960 --> 37:59.460
there's a small part of me
that wonders

37:59.460 --> 38:02.090
when she's gonna come back.

38:02.100 --> 38:04.460
You'd get back together.

38:04.470 --> 38:05.870
You'd have to try
one of us for murder.

38:05.870 --> 38:08.470
I don't know.

38:08.470 --> 38:13.440
But I always think about it.
It's weird.

38:13.440 --> 38:15.980
Maybe it's what happens when you
have a kid with someone.

38:15.980 --> 38:19.010
The family thing or all that.

38:22.680 --> 38:25.950
- He should be here any minute.

38:32.930 --> 38:35.160
- Good morning.
Thank you for coming in.

38:35.160 --> 38:37.000
- What is she doing here?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.530
- I hope we're here
for an apology.

38:39.530 --> 38:41.000
From all of you.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.600
- That'll be the day.

38:44.140 --> 38:46.910
Mrs. Reynolds and her lawyer
have agreed to take a deal.

38:46.910 --> 38:48.540
- Smartest thing
she's ever done.

38:48.540 --> 38:49.980
- She agreed to plead
to manslaughter

38:49.980 --> 38:53.610
in exchange for a five-year
prison sentence.

38:53.610 --> 38:56.480
- Good.

38:56.480 --> 38:58.080
- Bastard.

38:58.090 --> 39:00.920
- See what
I have to put up with?

39:00.920 --> 39:03.520
- You? What kind of father

39:03.520 --> 39:06.060
pretends to kidnap
his own daughter?

39:06.060 --> 39:08.660
- That's never been established.

39:12.030 --> 39:14.130
I'm sorry, Mr. stone.

39:14.140 --> 39:17.000
I don't want the deal anymore.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.040
- It's a good deal, Jane.
- No, he gets

39:19.040 --> 39:21.140
full custody of Emma?

39:21.140 --> 39:22.540
How often do you think
he's gonna

39:22.540 --> 39:24.780
bring her to prison to visit me?

39:24.780 --> 39:27.210
- If we lose at trial,
you could do ten years.

39:27.220 --> 39:32.220
- I have to at least try.

39:32.220 --> 39:33.790
- That's fine by me.

39:35.960 --> 39:37.260
- Please stand.

39:39.160 --> 39:41.590
- I'll arrange bail, Jane.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.230
- You know, raising a child
is about a lot more

39:43.230 --> 39:46.530
than buying her
some rainbow kite.

39:46.530 --> 39:47.800
- Well, most kids
don't need to live

39:47.800 --> 39:50.100
in a four bedroom
in Lincoln park.

39:50.100 --> 39:52.170
- You've already ruined my life.

39:52.170 --> 39:54.210
And now you're gonna
destroy Emma too.

39:57.540 --> 40:02.250
To think I loved you once.

40:02.250 --> 40:04.650
- Ah, Jesus Christ.
Do you know why

40:04.650 --> 40:06.520
I made you go
to car-a-la-carte?

40:06.520 --> 40:07.750
- Shut up, Ted.

40:07.760 --> 40:10.560
- Because that is what
I had to do every time

40:10.560 --> 40:13.090
I wanted to take Emma anywhere.

40:13.090 --> 40:15.060
And the four banks?

40:15.060 --> 40:19.030
That's so you could see what
it's like chasing after a buck.

40:19.030 --> 40:21.730
Four jobs I had to work
to pay for you

40:21.740 --> 40:24.600
to live like a damn Princess.

40:24.610 --> 40:27.610
You didn't listen to me.

40:27.610 --> 40:30.580
I asked you to modify
the alimony.

40:30.580 --> 40:32.240
I begged you.

40:37.550 --> 40:40.690
Ah, what the hell.
It was me, I did it.

40:40.690 --> 40:43.620
I threatened her
and I'd do it again.

40:43.620 --> 40:47.860
- That is not a confession.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

40:47.860 --> 40:50.760
She's taken everything already,
I don't...

40:50.770 --> 40:53.770
I don't have anything left.

40:53.770 --> 40:55.700
Yeah, yeah, come on.

41:02.080 --> 41:03.310
- Ted Reynolds,
you're under arrest

41:03.310 --> 41:05.310
for the murder
of Christopher Jones.

41:05.310 --> 41:07.180
Again.

41:11.180 --> 41:14.690
- Under the circumstances...

41:14.690 --> 41:16.320
- one year probation.

41:27.170 --> 41:29.740
- jail for him,
probation for her.

41:29.740 --> 41:31.670
Another kid growing up
without her dad.

41:31.670 --> 41:34.110
- Chris's mom,
staring at photos in an album.

41:34.110 --> 41:35.240
Five lives ruined.

41:35.240 --> 41:38.140
- Another quirky donut.

41:38.150 --> 41:40.750
- Close enough.
- Bizarre.

41:40.750 --> 41:44.150
- He hates her, but he'll go
to prison for 20 years for her.

41:44.150 --> 41:47.920
- Hm. Justice isn't the only
thing that's blind.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.620
- Mm.
- You wanna

41:49.620 --> 41:51.220
grab a drink with us?
- No, thanks.

41:51.230 --> 41:54.790
I'm gonna go home
and kiss my wife.

41:54.800 --> 41:57.360
And take a long, hot shower.
