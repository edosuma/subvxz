I quit this poking game!

00:41.575 --> 00:44.543
These rules make no sense!

00:44.545 --> 00:48.247
Okay, Thor. One,
this isn't poker,
it's pinochle.

00:48.249 --> 00:51.884
And two, can someone
explain to me why
we're playing pinochle?

00:51.886 --> 00:54.186
Because it's Cap's turn
to choose the game.

00:54.188 --> 00:56.422
And because
it's Cap's turn
to choose the game,

00:56.424 --> 00:59.158
he chose one that
no one plays anymore.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.692
He's won every game,

to attack Avengers Tower

01:17.211 --> 01:18.710

01:18.712 --> 01:22.214
Well, maybe
we're attracting a more
polite kind of villain.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.049
Much as I'd like that
to be true, Hawkeye,

01:24.051 --> 01:27.419

Our experiment worked.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.401
We were once human.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.720
I know this is confusing.

04:14.722 --> 04:17.623
That ship looks
advanced enough

04:17.625 --> 04:19.791
That's what we should

If Ironclad likes U-Foes,
that's what we are.

couldn't have absorbed

04:30.437 --> 04:32.804

05:55.856 --> 05:58.323
Now there are more
new Inhumans every day.

05:58.325 --> 06:01.393
And since no one's
happy about that,
the President took action

06:01.395 --> 06:03.528
and just signed
the New Powers Act.

06:03.530 --> 06:06.298
(SCOFFS)
The what?
New Powers Act.

06:06.300 --> 06:10.035
It gives the government
control of the Avengers
and everything related to us.

06:10.037 --> 06:13.238
I never thought the President
would be foolish enough
to sign it, though.

06:13.240 --> 06:16.575
Then you should have
voted for someone else.
IRON MAN: Whatever.

06:16.577 --> 06:20.312
If Uncle Sam wants to slap

But you aren't "running
the show," Mr. Stark.

06:24.651 --> 06:27.085
That's the problem.
The world cannot afford
for you

06:27.087 --> 06:30.689
to sit on your hands

falls from the sky.

06:30.691 --> 06:33.358
It's time to become proactive.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.094
The CIA discovered
this Hydra base in Arizona.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.963
Your mission is to find out
what's inside it.

06:39.265 --> 06:41.900
Looks fortified.
We'll need Hulk to breach it.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.436
This intel is fresh.
We don't have time
to wait for Hulk.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.471
You can do the job
just fine without him.

06:49.742 --> 06:52.511

I'm with you.

then we better check it out.

Strucker has to come back

And only Baron Strucker
has the authority to lead us.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.458
But no one's seen him
for months.

07:06.460 --> 07:09.461
I don't like it, but we have
to consider other options.

07:09.463 --> 07:12.063

Good, you remember me.

My team and I flew
the spaceship into

Just as we'd planned.

How long have you waited,

come back

07:38.926 --> 07:41.092

found you?

07:41.094 --> 07:44.463
Well, the U-Foes
don't fear the Avengers.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.498
We've already beaten

not destroy it.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.109
You were not
part of the plan.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.344
That's not fair.

With all due respect,
you weren't there.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.733
That's the problem
with you Avengers.

11:41.735 --> 11:45.870
You think any landing
you can walk away from

You never stop to ask
why the plane crashed

11:49.810 --> 11:51.810
Don't be so hard
on yourself, Hulk.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.078
You didn't smash Marsh.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.046
That's more than
I might do in your place.

where to smash next.

It appears they were

12:21.108 --> 12:23.341
They stole a spaceship

We don't have much on them,
but if we look
into criminal records,

12:28.515 --> 12:30.215
we should be able
to find something.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.883
I don't think
we have time.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.251
These U-Foes
gained their abilities

12:33.253 --> 12:35.920
and took over Hydra
all in one day.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.856
They're gonna
strike again, fast.

12:37.858 --> 12:40.792
Not fast. Now.
(BEEPING)

12:40.794 --> 12:43.528
FALCON: An old
S.H.I.E.L.D. distress signal.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.996
<i>Coming from</i>
<i>an office building?</i>

12:50.636 --> 12:51.870
(GRUNTS)

12:53.139 --> 12:54.806
Oh, yeah!

12:54.808 --> 12:57.275
(BEATBOXING) Yeah!

12:58.277 --> 12:59.577
Hurry, before the...

12:59.579 --> 13:03.648
Avengers get here?
Too late.

13:03.650 --> 13:06.117
You really don't know
when you're beaten, do you?

13:06.119 --> 13:07.952
The Avengers
are never beat.

13:09.321 --> 13:10.955
(GRUNTS)

13:10.957 --> 13:13.625
Falcon, what's the situation
on civilians?

13:13.627 --> 13:17.128
Good news. I'm not
getting any life signs
above the ground floor.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.565
That's bad.
If Hydra isn't moving up,
it's heading down.

13:20.567 --> 13:21.933
And S.H.I.E.L.D.
always liked to keep

13:21.935 --> 13:24.002
the dangerous stuff
in the basement.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.004
This is an old
S.H.I.E.L.D. base?

13:26.006 --> 13:27.806
Then we cannot
let Hydra get it.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.676
(GRUNTS)

13:31.678 --> 13:33.678
You act like
you can stop us.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.113
Vapor, give us some cover.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.582
X-Ray, Ironclad,
take 'em all out.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.820
X-RAY: Come get some!
IRON MAN: Mmm, no, thanks.

13:44.790 --> 13:46.424
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
Vapor incoming!

13:48.427 --> 13:49.794
(GRUNTS)

13:49.796 --> 13:51.196
(YELLING)

13:51.198 --> 13:52.831
(BOTH COUGHING)

13:54.834 --> 13:56.801
IRONCLAD: Get back here!
(GRUNTS)

13:56.803 --> 13:57.836
(GROANS)

14:00.639 --> 14:01.873
Clothesline!

14:03.008 --> 14:04.442
Hey, Cap! (GRUNTS)

14:05.778 --> 14:07.645
Keep your eyes
open, Captain.

14:07.647 --> 14:11.449
If Vapor doesn't blind you,
you might learn something.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.284
Forget it, Ironclad.
I've been fighting

14:13.286 --> 14:15.186
goons like you since
before you were born.

14:15.988 --> 14:17.288
(GRUNTING)

14:18.991 --> 14:20.124
Great.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.126
Now one of them
has earthquake powers.

14:22.128 --> 14:23.361
It's not them.

14:25.064 --> 14:27.966
(KLAXON BLARING)
It's a S.H.I.E.L.D.
Helicarrier!

14:32.204 --> 14:35.039
But the old Helicarriers
were destroyed.

14:35.041 --> 14:39.544
Supposed to be destroyed.
It appears one
got stashed away.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.881
All systems are online, sir.
The Helicarrier is ours.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.616
You mean the U-boat,
don't you?

14:46.051 --> 14:49.020
Hmm. The "U-boat" it is.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.822
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
Falcon, evacuate the town.

14:50.824 --> 14:52.657
We can't leave citizens
in danger.

14:56.595 --> 14:58.696
I think we're
the ones in danger.

14:58.698 --> 15:01.099
VECTOR: (ON PA)
<i>I admire you Avengers.</i>

15:01.101 --> 15:05.603
<i>Even in the face</i>
<i>of all our power,</i>
<i>you're still defiant.</i>

15:05.605 --> 15:09.007
Stupid, but defiant. Fire!

15:09.009 --> 15:10.775
(WEAPONS POWERING UP)

15:15.714 --> 15:16.981
Everyone, take cover!

15:22.221 --> 15:24.789
VECTOR:
Welcome to the future,
ladies and gentlemen.

15:24.791 --> 15:27.692
No Avengers, no limits.

15:31.030 --> 15:32.830
FALCON: Heads up!
Missiles coming in!

15:33.432 --> 15:34.599
(GRUNTS)

15:43.609 --> 15:47.378
Set a course
for Washington, D.C.,
half-speed.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.147
Taking out a few
military bases

15:49.149 --> 15:51.816
should help convince
the President to surrender.

15:51.818 --> 15:54.986
I'd much rather live
in the White House
than destroy it.

15:56.822 --> 15:59.057
(GRUNTS)
Cap, are you in there?

15:59.059 --> 16:01.125
(GRUNTS)
Iron Man, are you okay?

16:01.127 --> 16:03.728
IRON MAN:
I will be, as soon as
you get off my legs.

16:07.333 --> 16:08.833
(GRUNTS)

16:08.835 --> 16:12.070
Even with their Helicarrier,
the U-Foes retreat from us.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.237
Cowards!

16:17.443 --> 16:20.945
Ah, something's
coming in on radar.

16:20.947 --> 16:23.181
HYDRA AGENT:
<i>Sir, it's just</i>
<i>a single aircraft.</i>

16:23.183 --> 16:25.016
What? Put it onscreen.

16:32.691 --> 16:35.326
We've got a missile lock.
Hang on!
(BEEPING)

16:43.135 --> 16:45.370
And they wonder why
I take them for fools.

16:48.607 --> 16:49.841
No, no, no!

16:56.215 --> 16:58.683
Hold tight.
This'll be a rough stop.

17:03.655 --> 17:05.156
We're in.

17:05.157 --> 17:06.057
We'll keep them busy
out here

17:06.059 --> 17:07.525
and rendezvous with you
when we can.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.693
Good luck.

17:13.898 --> 17:16.067
(GRUNTS)
Ahhh!

17:16.069 --> 17:17.734
The U-Foes
may have this ship,

17:17.737 --> 17:19.871
but we're the ones
who know Helicarriers
inside and out.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.573
Let's get to the bridge
and take it back.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.810
(GRUNTS)

17:25.811 --> 17:27.412
You could surrender.
Not a chance.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.914
Ahhh!

17:29.916 --> 17:31.049
They never pick surrender.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.084
Keep going.
I'll get us some privacy.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.888
We've been boarded.
The Avengers are here.

17:37.423 --> 17:39.257
Ahhh!

17:39.259 --> 17:40.558
(CAPTAIN AMERICA GRUNTS)

17:45.731 --> 17:47.732
Keep them at bay.
We can't lose the ship.

17:50.202 --> 17:51.369
Gentlemen, after you.

17:51.371 --> 17:54.072
(YELLS)
(GROANS)

17:54.074 --> 17:55.807
Don't just
stand there.
Attack!

17:58.177 --> 17:59.077
(GROANS)

18:00.846 --> 18:02.513
(GROANING)

18:05.284 --> 18:06.417
(YELLS)

18:07.519 --> 18:09.787
It's over, Vector.

18:09.789 --> 18:12.857
Stop, all of you,
or this entire state

18:12.859 --> 18:14.759
goes up like a match.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.127
Talk fast, Vector.

18:16.129 --> 18:20.465
VECTOR: This ship is set
to crash right into
a nuclear power plant.

18:20.467 --> 18:24.035
Only my personal password
can stop it.

18:24.037 --> 18:25.937
Get off my ship now,

18:25.939 --> 18:28.906
or half this state
will glow in the dark.

18:28.908 --> 18:31.309
Big Green,
time to join the party.

18:34.046 --> 18:35.546
(ROARS)

18:35.548 --> 18:38.316
No! That's
the primary computer!

18:38.318 --> 18:40.651
Now nothing can change
the ship's course.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.653
You better run
for it, then.

18:42.655 --> 18:43.888
(GRUNTS)

18:46.792 --> 18:48.826
(GRUNTS)
We're going down!
Out of my way!

18:48.828 --> 18:50.294
X-RAY:
One side, Vector!

18:54.933 --> 18:56.200
(GRUNTS)

18:57.836 --> 19:01.038
Cowards. Like rats
off a sinking ship.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.673
Ship's not sunk yet.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.075
Good thinking, Hulk.

19:04.077 --> 19:07.645
Yeah, brilliant.
So how are we
not gonna crash?

19:07.647 --> 19:10.915
Hey, Hulk ain't the one
with "genius"
on his business card.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.049
I had to ask.

19:13.252 --> 19:14.285
How do we
get out of here?

19:14.287 --> 19:15.753
All the hallways
look the same.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.193
(WHIRRING)

19:24.796 --> 19:27.365
Seriously? You think
that's going to hold us?

19:27.367 --> 19:30.034
BLACK WIDOW: (ON PA)
<i>Oh, that's just</i>
<i>the cleanup crew.</i>

19:30.036 --> 19:31.369
Knockout gas.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.204
(ALL COUGHING)

19:40.679 --> 19:41.879
(MOANS)

19:44.349 --> 19:45.349
Nighty-night.

19:47.886 --> 19:50.388
Looks like a Stark tech
interface.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.124
Or something close to it.

19:53.126 --> 19:55.126
IRON MAN:
Welcome to Stark
Industries Airlines,

19:55.128 --> 19:57.962
where the drinks are cold
and the flight attendants
are...

19:57.964 --> 19:59.197
Tony, fly the ship.

20:09.341 --> 20:11.075
(COW LOWS)
IRON MAN: Not bad.

20:12.344 --> 20:13.945
I think we did okay.

20:17.182 --> 20:19.183
MARSH: Every shred
of data destroyed.

20:19.185 --> 20:20.885
The whole computer
was scrapped.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.587
We saved a town, a state,

20:22.589 --> 20:25.089
a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. base,
and a Helicarrier,

20:25.091 --> 20:27.558
and you're angry
about missing data?

20:27.560 --> 20:30.228
The world is run
on data, Captain.

20:30.230 --> 20:33.064
This entire operation
was based on gathering intel,

20:33.066 --> 20:36.367
and thanks to him,
I don't have any of it!

20:36.369 --> 20:38.903
You went off half-cocked
one too many times.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.939
Sir, I pushed Hulk to it.
If you need to blame
someone...

20:41.941 --> 20:44.942
Don't presume
to order me, Romanova.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.444
Pack your things, Hulk.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.279
You're not
an Avenger anymore.

20:49.781 --> 20:51.249
You can't do that!
No way, man!

20:51.251 --> 20:54.385
What gives you
the right...
Guys, stop.

20:54.387 --> 20:57.922
Appreciate it,
but Hulk will always
be an Avenger,

20:57.924 --> 21:00.958
whether some puny suit
says so or not.

21:06.098 --> 21:09.467
Yeah, Marsh,
he seemed really
out of control.

21:09.469 --> 21:12.069
Say, here's a question.
Where are you
gonna find someone

21:12.071 --> 21:14.572
who could even possibly
fill Hulk's shoes?

21:14.574 --> 21:16.440
Just wondering.

21:16.442 --> 21:19.010
Oh, I already have
his replacement.

21:22.214 --> 21:24.548
Gentlemen, ladies,

21:24.550 --> 21:28.252
the name's Hulk, Red Hulk.

21:28.254 --> 21:31.455
Now, what are we
gonna smash first?
