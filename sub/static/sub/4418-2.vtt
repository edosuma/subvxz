IT WAS HUGE.

00:41.313 --> 00:42.946
I HATE

NOBODY HATES
RAINBOWS.

TO HATE ABOUT RAINBOWS?

00:47.353 --> 00:48.085
WELL, YOU KNOW...

00:48.087 --> 00:51.555
YOU'LL JUST BE SITTING THERE
MINDING YOUR OWN BUSINESS,

00:51.557 --> 00:53.290
AND THEY'LL COME
MARCHING IN

00:53.292 --> 00:54.658
AND CRAWL UP YOUR LEG

00:54.660 --> 00:56.693
AND START BITING
THE INSIDE OF YOUR ASS.

00:56.695 --> 00:57.894

00:57.896 --> 01:01.698
"HEY, GET OUT OF MY ASS,
YOU STUPID RAINBOWS!"

01:01.700 --> 01:05.402
CARTMAN, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:05.404 --> 01:06.903
I'M TALKING
ABOUT RAINBOWS.

01:06.905 --> 01:08.472
I HATE THOSE
FREAKING THINGS.

01:08.474 --> 01:10.374
RAINBOWS ARE THOSE
LITTLE ARCHES OF COLOR

01:10.376 --> 01:12.876
THAT SHOW UP
DURING A RAINSTORM.

01:12.878 --> 01:14.478
OH, RAIN<i> BOWS</i>!

01:14.480 --> 01:17.014
OH YEAH, I LIKE THOSE,

01:17.016 --> 01:19.116

CRAWLS UP YOUR LEG

01:23.155 --> 01:25.422

01:26.025 --> 01:26.923

01:26.925 --> 01:29.226

"SAVE OUR FRAGILE PLANET"
ESSAY CONTEST

01:29.228 --> 01:32.963
THAT YOU CHILDREN WORKED
SO HARD ON LAST MONTH?

01:34.133 --> 01:36.733
ONE OF OUR VERY OWN
SOUTH PARK STUDENTS

01:36.735 --> 01:39.369
HAS WON THE
NATIONAL PRIZE.

01:39.772 --> 01:41.772
WOW, I KNEW
I WOULD WIN.

01:41.774 --> 01:44.341
GOSH, MR. GARRISON,
THIS SURE IS EXCITING.

01:44.343 --> 01:45.208
THAT'S RIGHT
MR. HAT,

01:45.210 --> 01:50.213
THE WINNER OF THE NATIONAL
"SAVE OUR FRAGILE PLANET"
CONTEST IS...

01:50.215 --> 01:52.015
ERIC CARTMAN.

01:52.017 --> 01:52.783
WHAT?!

01:52.785 --> 01:53.216
WHAT?!

01:53.218 --> 01:54.418
CONGRATULATIONS, ERIC,

01:54.420 --> 01:56.820
ON WRITING THE
AWARD WINNING PAPER.

01:56.822 --> 01:58.055
KICK ASS!

01:58.057 --> 01:58.789
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

01:58.791 --> 02:01.358
HE DOESN'T KNOW A RAIN FOREST
FROM A POP-TART!

02:01.360 --> 02:04.094
YEAH I DO,
POP-TARTS ARE FROSTED!

02:04.096 --> 02:05.862
OUT OF OVER
A MILLION PAPERS

02:05.864 --> 02:08.565
ERIC'S WAS CHOSEN AS
THE GRAND PRIZE WINNER.

02:08.567 --> 02:11.468
WHAT DID YOU
WRITE ABOUT?

02:11.470 --> 02:12.602
YOU KNOW,
THIS AND THAT.

02:12.604 --> 02:14.905
HE DOESN'T EVEN<i> KNOW</i>
WHAT HE WROTE ABOUT!

02:14.907 --> 02:16.406
WHAT WAS YOUR PAPER
ABOUT, WENDY?

02:16.408 --> 02:18.442
MY PAPER WAS ON
THE SUFFERING

02:18.444 --> 02:20.243
OF BOTTLE-NOSED
DOLPHINS.

02:20.245 --> 02:20.877
WELL,
YOU SEE?

02:20.879 --> 02:23.313
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE WRITTEN
A PAPER ABOUT DOLPHINS.

02:23.315 --> 02:24.147
DOLPHINS
ARE STUPID.

02:24.149 --> 02:28.118
DUDE, DOLPHINS ARE THE SECOND
SMARTEST ANIMAL ON THE PLANET.

02:28.120 --> 02:28.819
RIGHT.

02:28.821 --> 02:29.953
IF THEY'RE
SO DAMN SMART

02:29.955 --> 02:34.825
HOW COME THEY GET CAUGHT IN
FISHING NETS ALL THE TIME?

02:34.827 --> 02:35.425
WHAT?!

02:35.427 --> 02:36.359
WAIT, WAIT,
THERE'S MORE.

02:36.361 --> 02:38.829
IT SAYS HERE
THAT ERIC'S TROPHY

02:38.831 --> 02:42.065
WILL BE PRESENTED
TO HIM BY..

02:42.067 --> 02:44.468
"KATHIE LEE GIFFORD"?

02:44.470 --> 02:46.336
KATHIE LEE IS COMING
TO SOUTH PARK?

02:46.338 --> 02:49.840
AND THE PRESENTATION WILL BE
ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.

02:49.842 --> 02:51.074
TELEVISION?
TELEVISION?

02:51.076 --> 02:53.210
( thinking )
Kathie Lee Gifford.

02:53.212 --> 02:55.178
I don't believe it.

02:55.180 --> 02:58.448
KATHIE LEE GIFFORD
IN SOUTH PARK!

02:58.450 --> 02:59.182
OH, MY GOD!

02:59.184 --> 03:01.952
THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO MAKE
A NAME FOR OURSELVES.

03:01.954 --> 03:04.554
TO SHOW THAT WE'RE NOT
JUST SOME PISSANT

03:04.556 --> 03:05.622
WHITE BREAD
MOUNTAIN TOWN.

03:05.624 --> 03:09.226
BETTER YET, IT'S A CHANCE
FOR<i> YOU</i> TO GET SOME PUBLICITY.

03:09.228 --> 03:09.726
YES!

03:09.728 --> 03:12.195
IF I CAN SHOW HOW MUCH
I'VE TURNED SOUTH PARK AROUND,

03:12.197 --> 03:14.331
I COULD BECOME
A SENATOR!

03:14.333 --> 03:16.233
MAYBE EVEN
A<i> STATE</i> SENATOR!

03:16.235 --> 03:18.201
MAYOR, WE SHOULD DECORATE
THE TOWN SQUARE.

03:18.203 --> 03:20.337
THEN WE SHOULD HAVE THE CHEF
OF THE SCHOOL CAFETERIA

03:20.339 --> 03:24.274
SING A SONG AND PLAY UP THE
ETHNIC DIVERSITY OF OUR TOWN.

03:24.276 --> 03:25.542
THAT'S RIGHT!

03:25.544 --> 03:27.244
HE'S A BLACK GUY,
ISN'T HE?

03:27.246 --> 03:29.613
BLACK AS THE NIGHT
ITSELF, MAYOR.

03:29.615 --> 03:30.013
YES!

03:30.015 --> 03:32.415
AND WE CAN HAVE
THE CHILDREN OF SOUTH PARK

03:32.417 --> 03:33.984
PUT ON A LITTLE PLAY.

03:33.986 --> 03:35.819
KATHIE LEE
LOVES CHILDREN.

03:35.821 --> 03:38.788
IF THEY'RE WORKING IN
A SWEATSHOP THAT IS.

03:38.790 --> 03:39.956
OUCH!

03:39.958 --> 03:41.291
THANK YOU.

03:41.293 --> 03:42.225
YOU GUYS,
GUESS WHAT?

03:42.227 --> 03:46.329
AFTER I'M ON TELEVISION,
I'M GONNA BE TOTALLY FAMOUS.

03:46.331 --> 03:48.698
HITLER WAS
FAMOUS TOO.

03:48.700 --> 03:50.100
HELLO THERE
CHILDREN.

03:50.102 --> 03:50.834
HEY CHEF.
HEY CHEF.

03:50.836 --> 03:52.836
HOW ARE MY LITTLE
CRACKERS TODAY?

03:52.838 --> 03:53.537
GOOD.
GOOD.

03:53.539 --> 03:54.704
DID YOU HEAR
THE NEWS?

03:54.706 --> 03:57.307
KATHIE LEE GIFFORD
IS COMING TO SOUTH PARK!

03:57.309 --> 03:58.742
YEAH, 'CAUSE
CARTMAN CHEATED

03:58.744 --> 04:01.144
AND WON THE ENVIRONMENTAL
ESSAY CONTEST.

04:01.146 --> 04:02.312
YEAH, YEAH,
WHATEVER.

04:02.314 --> 04:03.547
BUT THE MAYOR
JUST CALLED

04:03.549 --> 04:06.183
AND ASKED<i> ME</i> TO SING
AT THE CEREMONY.

04:06.185 --> 04:08.285
WOW! ARE YOU
GONNA DO IT?

04:08.287 --> 04:09.052
OF COURSE.

04:09.054 --> 04:11.788
KATHIE LEE IS A BEAUTIFUL
SULTRY QUEEN

04:11.790 --> 04:13.190
OF SEXUAL FANTASY.

04:13.192 --> 04:14.724
AND IF
I SING TO HER...

04:14.726 --> 04:18.962
MAYBE I CAN LURE HER INTO
A NIGHT OF EXOTIC<i> DELECTATION.</i>

04:18.964 --> 04:21.798
YEAH THAT'D
BE COOL!

04:21.800 --> 04:22.532
( mumbling )

04:22.534 --> 04:26.736
WELL, THREE TIMES BIGGER
THAN FRANK GIFFORD'S ANYWAY.

04:26.738 --> 04:29.339
I CAN'T EVEN CONCENTRATE
ON GRADING PAPERS

04:29.341 --> 04:31.808
WITH ALL
THIS EXCITEMENT.

04:32.244 --> 04:34.611
WHY YOU LOOKING AT ME
LIKE THAT, MR. HAT?

04:34.613 --> 04:37.547
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ABOUT
ALL THE PAIN AND SUFFERING

04:37.549 --> 04:39.349
THAT KATHIE LEE GIFFORD
CAUSED YOU?

04:39.351 --> 04:41.585
MR. HAT,
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO

04:41.587 --> 04:43.620
AND I WAS
ONLY A CHILD.

04:43.622 --> 04:46.022
WE COULD'VE WON
THAT TALENT SHOW.

04:46.024 --> 04:48.124
WE COULD'VE BEEN<i> HUGE.</i>

04:48.126 --> 04:49.593

10:01.706 --> 10:02.338
OH, FINE.

10:02.340 --> 10:04.674
WE WERE JUST ABOUT
TO RUN IT FROM THE TOP.

10:04.676 --> 10:05.942
OH, PLEASE DO.

10:05.944 --> 10:07.277
I'M<i> DYING</i>
TO SEE IT.

10:07.279 --> 10:11.147
ALL THE LITTLE PIONEERS
ON THIS SIDE OF THE STAGE.

10:11.149 --> 10:11.648
GOOD.

10:11.650 --> 10:15.018
AND ALL THE LITTLE INDIANS
GO TO THE CENTER OF THE STAGE.

10:15.020 --> 10:17.287
AM I AN INDIAN
OR A PIONEER?

10:17.289 --> 10:19.355
DO YOU HAVE A FEATHER
ON YOUR HEAD?

10:19.357 --> 10:19.822
YES.

10:19.824 --> 10:21.324
THEN YOU'RE
AN INDIAN.

10:21.326 --> 10:21.858
OH.

10:21.860 --> 10:23.893
OKAY, BABAY,
THIS IS YOUR LINE.

10:23.895 --> 10:27.297
THIS IS THE STORY
OF SOUTH PARK.

10:27.299 --> 10:30.366
IT BEGINS OVER
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO

10:30.368 --> 10:33.870
WHEN THE NOBLE AND HEARTY
UTE INDIANS

10:33.872 --> 10:36.372
LIVED ON THE LAND.

10:38.677 --> 10:41.578
OH, DON'T THEY
LOOK ADORABLE?

10:41.580 --> 10:43.279
THEN FROM THE EAST

10:43.281 --> 10:46.316
CAME THE GREAT
WHITE PIONEERS.

10:46.851 --> 10:48.451
( screaming )

10:51.389 --> 10:52.322
OH, MY GOD!

10:52.324 --> 10:54.424
THEY DID IT A LOT BETTER
THIS MORNING.

10:54.426 --> 10:55.959
THEY HAD
MORE ENERGY.

10:55.961 --> 10:58.328
THE PIONEERS MET
WITH THE INDIANS

10:58.330 --> 11:03.032
AND NEGOTIATED
FOR THEIR FERTILE LANDS.

11:03.435 --> 11:04.000
MR. GARRISON,

11:04.002 --> 11:06.869
WE CANNOT HAVE OUR CHILDREN
BEATING EACH OTHER SENSELESS

IN THOSE DAYS.

TAKE THAT,
YOU STUPID INDIAN!

11:14.112 --> 11:17.614
MR. GARRISON,
THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE!

11:17.616 --> 11:19.082
DO YOU
ACTUALLY THINK

11:19.084 --> 11:21.684
THAT KATHIE LEE GIFFORD
WOULD ENJOY THIS?!

11:21.686 --> 11:24.153

HE SAID "TO HELL WITH

11:31.563 --> 11:32.495
<i>MR. GARRISON,</i>

11:32.497 --> 11:36.933
I AM DISMISSING YOU
FROM DIRECTING OUR PLAY.

17:36.961 --> 17:38.327
BOOK DEPOSITORY.

17:38.329 --> 17:39.395
DEPOSITORY.

17:39.397 --> 17:40.896
BOOK DEPOSITORY.

17:40.898 --> 17:42.665
DAMN, HE COULD
BE ANYWHERE!

17:42.667 --> 17:44.834
I'LL SEND OUT
AN<i> APB.</i>

17:44.836 --> 17:46.902
WENDY, LOOK!

17:46.904 --> 17:49.138
AND NOW, HERE TO PRESENT
THE AWARD

17:49.140 --> 17:53.776
FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL ESSAY
TO OUR OWN ERIC KAUFMANN--

17:53.778 --> 17:55.711
( Eric )
CARTMAN, GODDAMNIT!

17:55.713 --> 17:59.181
IS<i> YOUR</i> FAVORITE CELEBRITY
AND MINE...

17:59.183 --> 18:03.552
KATHIE LEE GIFFORD!

18:06.157 --> 18:07.323
THANK YOU.

18:07.325 --> 18:08.891
I LOVE YOU ALL.

18:08.893 --> 18:10.192
MR. GARRISON!

18:10.194 --> 18:10.960
STOP!

18:10.962 --> 18:11.727
LEAVE US.

18:11.729 --> 18:14.096
WE MUST FINISH
WHAT WE HAVE BEGUN.

18:14.098 --> 18:16.532
I KNOW THAT
SHE'S HURT YOU.

18:16.534 --> 18:17.800
SHE'S HURT
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

18:17.802 --> 18:19.101
YOU CAN'T KNOW.

18:19.103 --> 18:21.504
YOU SHOULD'VE WON
THAT TALENT SHOW.

18:21.506 --> 18:23.506
IT IS WITH GREAT HONOR
AND PRIDE

18:23.508 --> 18:25.875
THAT I PRESENT THE WINNER
THIS TROPHY.

18:25.877 --> 18:28.577
ERIC, WOULD YOU PLEASE
COME UP HERE.

18:28.579 --> 18:29.779
HERE IT IS...

18:29.781 --> 18:31.647
MY BIG MOMENT OF FAME.

18:31.649 --> 18:34.517
AND THEN SHE FINISHED IT ALL
BY THROWING HER VOICE

18:34.519 --> 18:35.684
WITH TWO DUMMIES
AT ONCE.

18:35.686 --> 18:39.722
I KNOW THAT MR. GARRISON,
BUT THIS ISN'T THE ANSWER.

18:39.724 --> 18:40.389
IT IS...

18:40.391 --> 18:43.459
TOO LATE FOR ME,
YOUNG WENDY.

18:44.729 --> 18:47.163
YOU SEE, I'VE LEARNED
SOMETHING TODAY.

18:47.165 --> 18:49.365
YOU CAN'T WIN
<i>ALL</i> THE TIME.

18:49.367 --> 18:50.199
AND IF YOU DON'T WIN,

18:50.201 --> 18:52.701
YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T HOLD IT
AGAINST THE PERSON WHO DID

18:52.703 --> 18:57.339
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
YOU EVER<i> REALLY</i> LOSE.

18:57.341 --> 18:59.809
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:59.811 --> 19:00.342
<i>GOOD.</i>

19:00.344 --> 19:02.511
MAN, DID SHE REALLY
THROW HER VOICE

19:02.513 --> 19:04.780
WITH TWO DUMMIES
AT ONCE?

19:04.782 --> 19:06.982
THE BITCH MUST DIE!

19:15.526 --> 19:17.793
OH, MY GOD,
THEY KILLED KENNY!

19:17.795 --> 19:20.429
YOU BASTARD!

19:20.565 --> 19:21.497
GUARD!

19:21.499 --> 19:21.964
GUARD!

19:21.966 --> 19:23.099
HEY COME BACK!

19:23.101 --> 19:25.801
WE DIDN'T EVEN
GET TO DO OUR PLAY!

19:26.671 --> 19:28.737
I GUESS THAT'S IT GUYS,
WRAP IT UP.

19:28.739 --> 19:30.072
HEY WAIT A MINUTE!

19:30.074 --> 19:32.741
WHEN DO I GET
TO BE ON TELEVISION?!

19:32.743 --> 19:33.809
FORGET IT, KID.

19:33.811 --> 19:35.711
NO KATHIE LEE,
NO PUBLIC INTEREST.

19:35.713 --> 19:38.747
BUT I WON THE
ENVIRONMENTAL ESSAY CONTEST!

19:38.749 --> 19:41.784
YOU DON'T<i> DESERVE</i>
TO WIN, CARTMAN,

19:41.786 --> 19:43.018
AND YOU KNOW IT!

19:43.020 --> 19:45.721
I'M HOLDING CARTMAN'S
AWARD-WINNING PAPER.

19:45.723 --> 19:48.524
IT'S ACTUALLY NOTHING MORE
THAN "WALDEN"

19:48.526 --> 19:50.726
WITH<i> HENRY DAVID THOREAU'S</i>
NAME CROSSED OUT

19:50.728 --> 19:53.963
AND CARTMAN'S NAME
WRITTEN IN ITS PLACE.

19:53.965 --> 19:54.763
WHO CARES?

19:54.765 --> 19:56.966
KATHIE LEE GIFFORD'S
GONE!

19:56.968 --> 19:58.734
WHAT ABOUT NOT
HOLDING ANYTHING

19:58.736 --> 20:00.302
AGAINST THE PERSON
WHO WINS?

20:00.304 --> 20:03.005
WELL, NOT IF
IT'S CARTMAN.

20:03.007 --> 20:04.940
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU
ALL GOING?!

20:04.942 --> 20:07.443
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT "WALDEN"<i> IS.</i>

20:07.445 --> 20:11.847
I BET IF "WALDEN" WAS A SITCOM
YOU'D ALL KNOW WHAT IT WAS!

20:11.849 --> 20:12.481
C'MON, WENDY,

20:12.483 --> 20:15.284
KYLE'S MOM WILL MAKE US
TUNA FISH SANDWICHES.

20:15.286 --> 20:17.419
OH, WHAT THE HELL.

20:17.421 --> 20:18.621
NO, NO!

20:18.623 --> 20:21.790
NOW I'LL BE STUCK
IN THIS TOWN FOREVER

20:21.792 --> 20:25.594
WITH ALL THESE STUPID HICK
RED-NECK, JOBLESS,

20:25.596 --> 20:27.730
TRUCK DRIVING IDIOTS!

20:27.732 --> 20:29.798
MAYOR,
THE MIC IS ON.

20:29.800 --> 20:33.135
THOUGHT YOU COULD GET AWAY
WITH IT, MR. HAT?

20:33.137 --> 20:34.870
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN
AWAY WITH IT

20:34.872 --> 20:36.338
IF IT WEREN'T
FOR THOSE MEDDLING KIDS.

20:36.340 --> 20:38.541
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU MISSED
KATHIE LEE GIFFORD

20:38.543 --> 20:41.277
AND THAT
NOBODY GOT HURT.

20:45.716 --> 20:47.149
WELL CHILDREN,
I'D LOVE TO,

20:47.151 --> 20:50.419
BUT THE DOCTORS SAY THAT
MR. HAT NEEDS MORE THERAPY.

20:50.421 --> 20:51.887
WE CAN STILL
GET HER!

20:51.889 --> 20:55.524
I'M JUST SO SORRY THAT
I RUINED EVERYONE'S CHANCES

20:55.526 --> 20:56.992
FOR BEING ON TV.

20:56.994 --> 21:00.095
NOT CARTMAN, HE GETS
TO BE ON TV ANYWAY.

21:00.097 --> 21:01.997
REALLY?
ON WHAT?

21:01.999 --> 21:03.165
OBESITY...

21:03.167 --> 21:04.800
ADIPOSITY...

21:04.802 --> 21:05.434
CORPULENCE...

21:05.436 --> 21:09.505
WHATEVER WORD YOU USE,
IT REPRESENTS ONE THING...

21:09.507 --> 21:10.539
BEING A BIG FAT ASS.

21:10.541 --> 21:12.775
WE HAVE WITH US TODAY,
LIVE VIA SATELLITE

21:12.777 --> 21:15.344
ERIC CARTMAN
FROM SOUTH PARK,

21:15.346 --> 21:17.046
WHO IS NOW SO OBESE

21:17.048 --> 21:19.682
HE CAN'T EVEN GET
OUT OF HIS HOUSE.

21:19.684 --> 21:21.183
WHEN IS THIS GONNA
BE ON THE AIR?

21:21.185 --> 21:25.154
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE
TO SAY TO PEOPLE OUT THERE?

21:25.156 --> 21:26.355
FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS!

21:26.357 --> 21:29.992
YOU<i> CAN</i> REACH YOUR GOALS,
I'M LIVING PROOF.

21:29.994 --> 21:32.361
BEEFCAKE,
BEEFCAKE!

21:32.363 --> 21:34.797
HE NEEDS TO RUN HIS ASS
AROUND THE BLOCK A FEW TIMES.

21:34.799 --> 21:38.601
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE MORE
OF THAT GOOD LOVIN', CHEF?

21:38.603 --> 21:39.435
DAMN, WOMAN!

21:39.437 --> 21:41.971
I JUST GAVE YOU SWEET LOVIN'
FIVE MINUTES AGO!
