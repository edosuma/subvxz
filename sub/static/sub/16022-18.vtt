WEBVTT

00:02.035 --> 00:04.103
(crickets chirping)

00:08.108 --> 00:11.276
(television playing
indistinctly)

00:17.550 --> 00:19.618
(laughter, conversation on tv)

00:33.233 --> 00:35.401
(tv playing indistinctly)

00:35.403 --> 00:37.302
(dog whimpers)

00:37.304 --> 00:39.538
(woman speaks quietly
to dog)

00:57.323 --> 01:00.092
(laughter and conversation
continues on tv)

01:16.076 --> 01:18.510
Mom, I'm tired.
Can we stop now?

01:18.512 --> 01:20.512
Just one more house.

01:20.514 --> 01:22.614
Then we'll go home
for dinner, okay?

01:30.457 --> 01:32.291
They're not home.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.526
The conners bought
ten candy bars

01:34.528 --> 01:36.829
From you
last year.
(phone ringing)

01:36.831 --> 01:38.831
(knocking)

01:38.833 --> 01:39.832
Sharon.

01:39.834 --> 01:41.500
How are you?
(laughs)

01:41.502 --> 01:42.734
Yeah, we got back
last weekend.

01:42.736 --> 01:43.836
Sorry we missed
the party.

01:43.838 --> 01:46.105
Was he surprised?

01:47.307 --> 01:48.841
Oh!

01:48.843 --> 01:50.442
Wonderful. Amazing.

01:53.446 --> 01:54.646
Beautiful.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.715
Really, you need
to go with burt.

01:58.218 --> 01:59.585
(groans weakly)

01:59.587 --> 02:03.789
(girl screams,
fades into police siren wailing)

02:07.193 --> 02:08.260
Was that our victim?

02:08.262 --> 02:10.195
Well, yes and no.

02:10.197 --> 02:11.563
His name is
doug adamson.

02:11.565 --> 02:14.333
He's, uh, 30 days out
of county lockup, right?

02:14.335 --> 02:16.201
Got a long rap sheet.

02:16.203 --> 02:18.337
Mostly drug use.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.304
Looks like he fell.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.472
<i>Knocked himself out.</i>

02:20.474 --> 02:21.607
Russell:
<i>I assume we're not here</i>

02:21.609 --> 02:22.608
<i>'cause he hurt his head.</i>

02:22.610 --> 02:24.243
Oh, he didn't live here.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.178
This house belongs
to the conner family.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.914
The neighbors said they haven't
seen them for almost a month.

02:28.916 --> 02:32.551
Ah. Well, whole families
just don't vanish.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.820
Well, we know it's
easier to find a
car than people,

02:34.822 --> 02:37.322
So I've got
a broadcast out
on their vehicles.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.892
What does doug adamson
have to say about all this?

02:39.894 --> 02:41.260
Well, nothing yet,

02:41.262 --> 02:42.728
But I'm going down
to the er later.

02:42.730 --> 02:44.396
All right, so we've
got a convicted felon

02:44.398 --> 02:46.265
Just out of jail
at the same time

02:46.267 --> 02:47.399
That a family disappears

02:47.401 --> 02:50.269
And we find him
inside their house--

02:50.271 --> 02:52.204
That does not look good
for mr. Adamson.

02:53.239 --> 02:56.175
Looks even worse
for the conner family.

03:02.782 --> 03:05.584
♪ who... Are you?

03:05.586 --> 03:08.687
♪ who, who, who, who?

03:08.689 --> 03:11.890
♪ who... Are you?

03:11.892 --> 03:13.258
♪ who, who, who, who?

03:13.260 --> 03:15.594
♪ I really wanna know

03:15.596 --> 03:18.363
♪ who... Are you?

03:18.365 --> 03:19.865
♪ oh-oh-oh
♪ <i>who...</i> ♪

03:19.867 --> 03:23.535
♪ come on, tell me who are you,
you, you ♪

03:23.537 --> 03:26.705
♪ are you!

03:31.778 --> 03:33.478
So a whole family is missing

03:33.480 --> 03:35.614
And no one reports it
to the police.

03:35.616 --> 03:36.915
Well, if I wasn't a csi,

03:36.917 --> 03:38.250
I would think
they just moved out.

03:38.252 --> 03:39.952
No tv, no furniture,

03:39.954 --> 03:42.821
Everything of value
is pretty much gone.

03:42.823 --> 03:45.324
Not if you include
sentimental value.

03:45.326 --> 03:48.594
Looks like they left behind
some of their family photos.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.662
Finlay: Hard to believe
they would leave those.

03:52.332 --> 03:54.366
All right, so this is where
our intruder, doug,

03:54.368 --> 03:56.368
Hit his head and fell.

03:59.806 --> 04:02.341
I'll see if I can find
anything else here.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.442
I'm gonna take the outside.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.410
Carpet hasn't been
recently shampooed.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.379
That's good
for us.
Stokes:
Yeah.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.581
You know, each of these photos

04:09.583 --> 04:11.350
Is a family member alone.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.551
Doing their own thing.

04:12.553 --> 04:13.585
Except for this one.

04:15.555 --> 04:19.691
Guess that's how families
are these days.

04:19.693 --> 04:22.394
Huh. Well, that's strange.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.297
This curtain's missing.

04:25.898 --> 04:28.300
Tieback, too.

04:32.038 --> 04:34.439
Two millimeter
medium force spatter.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.907
From doug adamson's fall?

04:35.909 --> 04:37.442
Yeah, some of it.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.011
Okay, so...

04:39.013 --> 04:40.512
Doug fell here...

04:42.448 --> 04:44.549
<i>...Causing spatter</i>
<i>to move upward,</i>

04:44.551 --> 04:45.684
<i>Close to the floor.</i>

04:45.686 --> 04:47.919
Further away, over here,

04:47.921 --> 04:50.922
Spatter is traveling downwards.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.758
Indicates a separate event.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.725
Exactly.

04:54.927 --> 04:57.429
Yeah, okay.

04:57.431 --> 04:58.497
Yeah, here we go.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.765
Some spatter
on the fireplace,

04:59.767 --> 05:02.334
And on the wall, as well.

05:04.504 --> 05:06.605
Nick, look at
the ceiling.

05:07.373 --> 05:08.507
Castoff.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.574
Stokes:
Ooh, yeah.

05:12.412 --> 05:14.446
All right, I'm gonna
luminol the place.
Okay.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.515
Do you mind stepping out
so that we both don't

05:16.517 --> 05:17.649
Trample all over
the evidence?

05:17.651 --> 05:18.650
Seriously?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.886
Yeah.

05:24.424 --> 05:25.757
She kick you out?
Yeah!

05:25.759 --> 05:27.526
(both laughing)

05:29.696 --> 05:31.430
Hey, check this out.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.031
The caulk on
this window...

05:33.033 --> 05:35.867
It's fresh.

05:35.869 --> 05:38.403
Stokes: Yeah, and the other ones
are yellow and cracked.

05:38.971 --> 05:39.938
That means that somebody

05:39.940 --> 05:42.607
Recently replaced that glass.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.443
All right.

05:48.614 --> 05:50.015
Hey, come take a look at this.

05:53.453 --> 05:55.454
Does that look like
blood to you?

05:55.456 --> 05:58.457
To the naked eye,
yes, it does.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.891
Soaked all the way
through the mat.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.493
It's hard to believe
someone would

06:01.495 --> 06:02.961
Drag a dead body
out the front door.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.697
Even at night,
there's not much cover out here.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.934
But I bet they did
some cleaning up.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.636
Which means we're
getting dirty.

06:11.638 --> 06:14.072
Time to dumpster dive.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.640
You're joining me, right?

06:15.642 --> 06:17.075
Yeah, um...
Woman:
Excuse me.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.610
Officer?

06:18.612 --> 06:20.078
Hi, there.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.079
What's your name?

06:21.081 --> 06:22.681
I'm madge.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.549
I'm a neighbor.

06:24.551 --> 06:25.984
I'm nick stokes.
I'm with the crime lab.

06:25.986 --> 06:29.087
I was just wondering...
What happened to the conners?

06:29.089 --> 06:30.422
Well, it's an ongoing
investigation,

06:30.424 --> 06:31.790
So I can't really
talk about it too much.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.692
Oh, I understand.

06:33.694 --> 06:34.793
Did you know them?

06:34.795 --> 06:37.562
Well, dwight, the husband,

06:37.564 --> 06:40.532
He works 9:00 to 5:00,
a real go-getter.

06:40.534 --> 06:43.468
And claire, she's a
lovely stay-at-home mom.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.437
Their son, I think
he graduated

06:45.439 --> 06:46.838
High school last year.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.408
I don't know much
about the daughter...

06:49.410 --> 06:52.444
But I haven't seen any of them
in the last few weeks.

06:52.446 --> 06:56.581
Did you see anybody
hanging around the house?

06:56.583 --> 06:58.583
Just the man they took
away in the ambulance.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.085
You know,
he was working

07:00.087 --> 07:02.053
Around the house
and living there.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.822
I thought he
was a relative.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.056
Hmm.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.658
Did you notice
anything else?

07:06.660 --> 07:08.660
Uh, yeah, there was
a great big truck

07:08.662 --> 07:10.195
And they were
loading in all kinds

07:10.197 --> 07:14.666
I thought the conners were
remodeling or something.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.168
I'd be willing to bet

07:16.170 --> 07:18.537
That you saw something on
that truck to give it away,

07:18.539 --> 07:20.839
Like a company name, logo,
anything like that?

07:20.841 --> 07:22.541
Yes, I did.

07:22.543 --> 07:23.608
It was, uh,

07:23.610 --> 07:26.478
Las vegas consignment.

07:26.480 --> 07:30.081
I would love
to live next-door to you.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.783
Oh, aren't you sweet?

07:35.154 --> 07:37.556
Hey, hey, that's all
the clothes I got!
Sorry.

07:37.558 --> 07:38.757
Gotta take them in for evidence.

07:38.759 --> 07:41.660
Question and
answer time.
Do we have to?

07:41.662 --> 07:42.928
My head still hurts.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.062
You're fine.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.664
How'd you know
the conner family?

07:45.666 --> 07:47.232
I was behind the mini-mart.
You know the one on 12th?

07:47.234 --> 07:49.100
What day was this?

07:49.102 --> 07:50.769
February 18.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.871
Oh, that's the day you
were released from county.

07:52.873 --> 07:56.641
Yeah, same day.
Mm-hmm.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.043
Dude drives up
and asks me

07:58.045 --> 07:59.678
If I wanted to
earn some money.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.679
Had you seen
him before?

08:00.681 --> 08:02.180
No. Never.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.682
What kind of work
did he ask you to do?

08:03.684 --> 08:05.650
Just some odd jobs
around his house.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.620
Mm-hmm. Is this the guy
you spoke with?

08:08.622 --> 08:09.621
Not him.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.723
Him... And-and
she was with him.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.592
Brass: Ethan conner and
his mother claire.

08:13.594 --> 08:16.761
I cleaned their garage.
I didn't finish till late,

08:16.763 --> 08:18.230
So they let me
spend the night.

08:18.232 --> 08:19.564
Inside the house?
Yeah.

08:19.566 --> 08:21.666
The guest room.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.835
Sounds like nice people.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.170
Can I see your hands, please?

08:26.672 --> 08:28.073
Over.

08:29.942 --> 08:31.676
They're pretty thrashed.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.211
Hard work'll do that.

08:33.213 --> 08:35.580
Okay, so you spent the night.
Then what happened?

08:35.582 --> 08:37.082
Then, the next morning,
they asked me to dig

08:37.084 --> 08:38.550
Some trenches
for the sprinklers.

08:38.552 --> 08:39.718
Some trenches?

08:39.720 --> 08:41.553
Yeah.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.788
What happened to
the conners, doug?

08:43.790 --> 08:45.090
No one's seen
them lately.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.558
In fact, you're
the last person

08:46.560 --> 08:47.726
To see them at all.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.160
I don't know.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.562
Okay?

08:50.564 --> 08:52.597
I was digging in the backyard,

08:52.599 --> 08:54.266
Saw them get
into their car.

08:54.268 --> 08:55.267
What kind of car?

08:55.269 --> 08:57.702
Blue suv.
Mm-hmm.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.538
They said they were
going to a movie

08:59.540 --> 09:01.172
And they never came back.

09:01.174 --> 09:03.275
A movie.
Yeah.

09:03.277 --> 09:04.643
So you just kept
digging, even though

09:04.645 --> 09:07.612
They told me I could stay
as long as I wanted.

09:07.614 --> 09:09.714
Sanders: For 30 days?
Didn't you ever get curious

09:09.716 --> 09:12.717
Yeah, but what was
I supposed to do?

09:12.719 --> 09:13.752
Call the cops?

09:14.620 --> 09:16.555
They'd take me back to jail.

09:16.557 --> 09:17.556
So whatever happened
to their furniture?

09:17.558 --> 09:18.557
The computers,

09:18.559 --> 09:20.625
Tvs...

09:22.595 --> 09:25.096
Look, I-I waited
for them to come back.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.197
Really.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.667
Then, after a week or two,

09:28.669 --> 09:31.770
I ran out of food,
so I sold some of the stuff,

09:31.772 --> 09:33.838
Just enough to cover
what they owed me.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.176
Then-then I sold
some more stuff.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.878
So perfect strangers
invite you,

09:39.880 --> 09:42.213
A convicted felon
and drug user,

09:42.215 --> 09:43.648
To stay at their
house indefinitely.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.884
And then they
mysteriously vanish,

09:45.886 --> 09:48.219
Leaving you to sell
off their property

09:48.221 --> 09:49.588
Piece by piece,
for cash.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.122
Sounds hard to believe, right?

09:51.124 --> 09:52.591
It's ridiculous.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.726
When he gets discharged,

09:54.728 --> 09:55.827
Bring him to the
police station.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.896
And beg somebody
to clean him up.

09:58.965 --> 10:00.599
♪

10:32.999 --> 10:34.966
Wow!

10:34.968 --> 10:36.735
That is a lot
of blood!

10:36.737 --> 10:38.770
What did you find outside?
More blood.

10:38.772 --> 10:41.773
And five bags of
wet, stinky trash.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.408
Okay.

10:43.410 --> 10:47.278
So, the predominance
of blood is in this
main living area.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.381
I marked the voids
with chalk

10:49.383 --> 10:51.683
To determine
the furniture placement.

10:51.685 --> 10:54.285
Which was not very difficult
because this entire carpet

10:54.287 --> 10:55.787
Is covered in blood.

10:55.789 --> 10:58.289
So I found
two interesting areas.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.925
Right here's
the most concentrated stain,

11:00.927 --> 11:02.794
About two feet in diameter.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.763
So somebody
was laying there bleeding.

11:04.765 --> 11:08.033
And the medium-force spatter
I found on the wall tells me

11:08.035 --> 11:11.836
That the beating occurred in
this general area.

11:11.838 --> 11:15.306
And the cast-off positions
the suspect here.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.374
But without the furniture,

11:16.376 --> 11:19.944
Stokes:
Well, I think I can
help you out there.

11:19.946 --> 11:23.148
The neighbor lady said she saw
las vegas consignment

11:23.150 --> 11:24.983
Moving a bunch of furniture
out of here.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.352
Whatever you could recover
would really help us.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.689
I'll get on that right now.
I'll see you later.
Bye.

11:30.691 --> 11:33.158
The most concerning evidence
I found is over here.

11:36.896 --> 11:37.896
Well...

11:37.898 --> 11:40.031
Drag marks.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.299
Mm-hmm.

11:43.436 --> 11:44.903
Where's that lead to?

11:44.905 --> 11:46.371
The end of the hall?

11:46.373 --> 11:48.840
A garage and backyard.

11:48.842 --> 11:52.777
Bloody drag marks mean
dead bodies to me.

11:52.779 --> 11:55.880
And anyone left alive who got
in a car with a killer...

11:55.882 --> 11:57.816
Probably dead, too.

12:00.820 --> 12:01.920
<i>Okay, the couch</i>

12:01.922 --> 12:04.155
Goes right over here.

12:04.157 --> 12:07.125
Be really careful you don't step
on the chalk, okay?

12:07.127 --> 12:08.359
And the string.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.261
Really careful of the string.
Thank you.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.796
She's a very bossy lady.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.364
Morning!
Morning.

12:13.366 --> 12:14.799
Wow, we're so lucky

12:14.801 --> 12:16.301
That we could track
all this down, huh?

12:16.303 --> 12:17.368
Nick's still working on it.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.937
Evidently,
las vegas consignment

12:18.939 --> 12:21.940
Keeps some pretty
shoddy records.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.409
And some of the folks didn't
want to give up their stuff.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.945
How did he charm them
into it?

12:26.947 --> 12:28.346
Showed them
the blood spatter.

12:28.348 --> 12:32.484
Nice. Okay, the end table
goes right here.

12:32.486 --> 12:34.953
The barstool
in the chalk circle.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.559
Ha!

13:14.561 --> 13:17.529
The, uh, cast-off
pattern extends

13:17.531 --> 13:19.531
All the way
across the room,

13:19.533 --> 13:21.332
Which means that
the weapon was long.

13:23.069 --> 13:26.971
That the poker from the fire set
is missing.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.841
All right,
so based on the spatter

13:29.843 --> 13:31.910
On each of these
barstools,

13:31.912 --> 13:33.311
I was able to determine

13:33.313 --> 13:35.280
Where they were
at the time of the beating.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.415
And this one
is the hero.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.083
All right, well,
it makes sense, right?

13:39.085 --> 13:41.486
You take out
the biggest threat first.

13:41.488 --> 13:44.289
Okay...

13:44.291 --> 13:45.557
So I'm dad.

13:45.559 --> 13:47.158
All right.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.128
So I am the suspect,
standing right about here.

13:50.130 --> 13:53.998
Point of origin is at
the convergence of string,

13:54.000 --> 13:55.366
Right where your head is.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.270
Wait a minute. You know what?

13:59.272 --> 14:02.340
You said that the victim was
struck multiple times, right?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.042
Yeah.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.977
Why am I just sitting
here taking it?

14:07.580 --> 14:10.915
Nick said that he noticed
that one of the curtain tiebacks

14:10.917 --> 14:15.053
Yeah, maybe the victim
was restrained.
Yeah.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.422
Tie me up.
All right.

14:19.391 --> 14:21.426
Ow.
Sorry.

14:21.428 --> 14:24.262
All right, so you're tied up
and I'm hitting you.

14:32.905 --> 14:34.939
You know what?
That would explain

14:34.941 --> 14:38.009
The gravitational drips down
the side of the stool here.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.044
All right, so this is
the main blood event,

14:40.046 --> 14:42.080
But without
the dna results,

14:42.082 --> 14:44.315
I can't tell you how many
other members

14:44.317 --> 14:45.516
Of the family were injured.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.619
This is a lot of blood.

14:47.621 --> 14:49.954
Russell:
Yeah, I know.
Hey.

14:49.956 --> 14:52.223
You guys have got
to see this.

14:54.093 --> 14:56.227
The ground-penetrating radar
found something.

14:57.898 --> 15:01.532
It looks like
it's been here over a month.

15:01.534 --> 15:04.068
Finlay: Well, it was
carefully wrapped.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.004
Conners must have
buried it.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.372
It gets worse, guys.

15:11.977 --> 15:13.378
The throat's been cut.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.914
That's horrible.
Nobody would do that

15:15.916 --> 15:16.948
To their own dog.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.683
No, that was a threat;
a warning

15:18.685 --> 15:24.555
Whoever that was knows
who sent it and what it meant.

15:24.557 --> 15:27.191
Someone in the conner family
was in way over their head.

15:27.193 --> 15:30.061
Probably what got them
all killed.

15:35.467 --> 15:38.336
You submitted over 50 samples
to dna from the conner scene.

15:38.338 --> 15:41.572
We have a family of four
who are missing.

15:41.574 --> 15:44.542
I would rather collect
too much than too little.

15:44.544 --> 15:47.011
Right.
Okay, so how
are we doing
with the family

15:47.013 --> 15:50.381
All the obvious sources
of dna in the house--

15:50.383 --> 15:51.449
Like hairbrushes
and toothbrushes--

15:51.451 --> 15:52.684
All that was thrown out.

15:52.686 --> 15:54.519
What about the trash?

15:54.521 --> 15:56.955
Morgan and hodges
are going through it,

15:56.957 --> 15:58.957
But anything they find
is likely contaminated.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.658
Until I get verifiable
references,

16:00.660 --> 16:04.095
All I can tell you is which
donor bled where and their sex.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.097
I will take whatever you've got.

16:06.099 --> 16:08.299
Okay. Uh, the stains at the bar:

16:08.301 --> 16:11.135
Jf-1 and 2 match
doug adamson.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.137
Finlay:
<i>Just as we thought.</i>

16:13.139 --> 16:17.542
I was able to identify another
male bleeder in the house,

16:17.544 --> 16:19.444
But he only matched
one sample, jf-13.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.980
Okay, so that's either
the father,

16:21.982 --> 16:24.282
<i>Dwight conner, or the son,</i>

16:24.284 --> 16:26.017
Ethan.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.052
Uh, given the limited population

16:28.054 --> 16:29.754
Of the four conner
family members.

16:29.756 --> 16:34.559
Uh, all the other blood sources
in the house

16:34.561 --> 16:38.196
Originated from
a single female donor.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.732
Female?

16:40.734 --> 16:43.167
So the blood spatter
and the drag marks?

16:43.169 --> 16:44.268
That's right.

16:45.371 --> 16:47.038
Okay, so that's gotta either be

16:47.040 --> 16:48.606
<i>The mother, claire conner</i>

16:48.608 --> 16:52.343
Or the daughter, heather.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.481
Assuming the limited
population...

16:56.483 --> 16:59.150
...Of the conner family.
Yes, I get it.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.385
Thank you.
Thank you, henry.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.786
Okay.

17:03.789 --> 17:05.390
Russell:
<i>I don't get it.</i>

17:05.392 --> 17:07.225
I mean, on the surface,

17:07.227 --> 17:10.094
The conners seem like
this typical family, right?

17:10.096 --> 17:11.696
The mom is a housewife,

17:11.698 --> 17:14.065
Daughter heather's
homeschooled.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.601
Which is why the school
didn't report her missing.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.269
Is the homeschooling
a recent thing?

17:18.271 --> 17:20.171
No. No, no.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.473
There was a bullying incident
about four years ago.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.242
Mom pulled her
out of school.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.177
Has been teaching ever since.
Okay.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.312
What about you? Did you find
anything in her room?

17:28.314 --> 17:30.281
No. Pretty routine stuff.

17:30.283 --> 17:33.117
<i>Nothing that raised</i>
<i>any red flags.</i>

17:33.119 --> 17:36.687
Okay, all right, that leaves
ethan the son,

17:36.689 --> 17:38.156
He's out of high school.

17:38.158 --> 17:42.427
That he hangs around
some shady characters.

17:42.429 --> 17:45.296
But when you look at his record,
two speeding tickets.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.665
The search of his room
is a different story.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.134
<i>Found some stash boxes</i>

17:50.136 --> 17:52.503
With traces of methamphetamine
and thc.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.705
Now, I think they're
doug's, the homeless guy's.

17:54.707 --> 17:58.242
But if they're not...
You know,

17:58.244 --> 18:01.746
Then maybe ethan, maybe ethan
got into some trouble

18:01.748 --> 18:03.381
With his sketchy friends.

18:03.383 --> 18:06.584
Enough trouble
to kill the whole family?

18:06.586 --> 18:08.219
No.
(phone chirps)

18:08.221 --> 18:09.320
Sorry. Brass.

18:12.124 --> 18:13.424
(knocking on door)

18:13.426 --> 18:15.193
Oh, yeah. Hey.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.527
Got your, uh, text.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.496
You have something for me
on claire conner?

18:18.498 --> 18:20.832
On February 1, claire conner
filed a police report.

18:20.834 --> 18:22.733
Uh, she claimed someone
was stalking her.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.569
Mostly minor vandalism.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.170
You know, they keyed her car,

18:26.172 --> 18:28.239
Slashed her tires, threw
a rock through the window.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.875
That would explain the glass
being recently replaced.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.244
Yeah. On the same day
that she called it in,

18:33.246 --> 18:34.812
She left the house for an hour.

18:34.814 --> 18:37.215
She came home, all the cabinets
were left wide open.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.583
So somebody got in.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.618
Police officers
were dispatched.
They offered

18:40.620 --> 18:43.287
To send a csi tech to print
the place, but she declined.

18:43.289 --> 18:46.557
That's interesting because
henry just confirmed

18:46.559 --> 18:49.861
That the blood on their
front porch was canine.

18:49.863 --> 18:52.563
Their dog was killed
and displayed as a threat.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.132
She never reported that.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.234
That's a little odd.

18:56.236 --> 18:59.337
(phone rings)
oh. Excuse me.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.272
Brass.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.877
Okay. Good work.

19:05.879 --> 19:09.180
So, dwight conner worked
for marvin braxton

19:09.182 --> 19:10.381
Of braxton imports.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.682
Coffee bean guy?

19:11.684 --> 19:14.318
Well, coffee and other
colombian imports.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.486
Braxton fired conner

19:15.488 --> 19:18.456
One day before
the family went missing.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.491
I'm bringing
him in now.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.294
Dwight conner worked for me
for seven years.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.295
In what capacity?

19:24.297 --> 19:25.830
He was my cfo.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.532
Oh. Why'd you fire him?

19:27.534 --> 19:30.701
He stole from me-- 500 g's.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.470
That's a lot of money.
Found out during

19:32.472 --> 19:34.705
A routine audit. Took the money
from the company account,

19:34.707 --> 19:36.174
Put it into
his personal account.

19:36.176 --> 19:39.644
That's not very smart
for a financial guy.

19:39.646 --> 19:42.380
He denies it, you know?
But you can check for yourself.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.848
It's in the account.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.349
Did you know
that the conner family

19:45.351 --> 19:46.417
Are officially missing persons?

19:46.419 --> 19:47.919
I've heard something about it.

19:47.921 --> 19:49.887
And are you aware
that they went missing

19:49.889 --> 19:52.223
One day after
you fired dwight conner?

19:52.225 --> 19:55.226
I'm not aware of any dates.

19:55.228 --> 19:57.929
I just figured they ran off
with the money.

19:57.931 --> 20:00.264
Funny thing is
it's still in his account.

20:00.266 --> 20:03.801
You know, we both know
that braxton imports launders

20:03.803 --> 20:05.503
More money than it earns.

20:05.505 --> 20:08.906
Those charges were dropped.

20:08.908 --> 20:11.275
This is a big money hit
for any business to absorb.

20:11.277 --> 20:13.578
I'll get the money back.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.513
I got my own way of doing it,

20:15.515 --> 20:17.748
And they don't involve going
after a family.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.451
We think the conner family met
with foul play.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.887
You're talking murder now.

20:24.790 --> 20:26.457
(laughs)

20:28.627 --> 20:30.962
Uh-huh.
I have no idea about that.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.465
You can direct any other
questions to my lawyer.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.938
So this is
the son's car, huh?

20:40.940 --> 20:42.907
Yeah. Auto shop called
after the broadcast.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.309
Driver's side's
pretty banged up.

20:45.311 --> 20:47.345
Car's been in the shop
for a month.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.379
Obviously hasn't been
repaired yet.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.647
A month? You know,

20:49.649 --> 20:51.282
We keep running into this
four-week wall.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.583
It's like life just stopped

20:52.585 --> 20:54.986
For that entire family
in an instant.

20:54.988 --> 20:57.455
Yeah. The mechanic called
the conners with the estimate.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.557
Never heard back,
so he put the car on hold.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.259
Hasn't touched it.
They know what happened?

21:01.261 --> 21:03.928
According to the dmv,

21:03.930 --> 21:06.664
Ethan conner was involved
in an accident February 15.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.432
Claimed it was due
to brake failure.

21:08.434 --> 21:09.767
Take a look.

21:12.871 --> 21:14.705
The steel brake lines

21:14.707 --> 21:17.508
On this car have been
completely cut

21:17.510 --> 21:20.278
Intentionally, front and back.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.413
Maybe it put him
in the hospital.

21:22.415 --> 21:26.050
I found a medical bracelet
belonging to ethan in the car.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.051
It's from

21:27.053 --> 21:28.653
Desert palm hospital.

21:28.655 --> 21:31.656
Well, brass is convinced
that the entire family

21:31.658 --> 21:34.292
Is paying for the father
stealing dirty money.

21:34.294 --> 21:35.359
You know, maybe

21:35.361 --> 21:37.428
They tried to threaten
the father

21:37.430 --> 21:38.663
By hurting the son,
you know what I mean?

21:38.665 --> 21:41.565
All mob style.

21:43.502 --> 21:45.336
(sniffs)

21:45.338 --> 21:47.471
Ugh, you know, we're
not gonna be able to pull

21:47.473 --> 21:50.074
Any definitive dna references
from all of this trash.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.742
It's a waste of time.

21:51.744 --> 21:52.743
I disagree.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.445
I find garbage fascinating.

21:54.447 --> 21:55.379
Yeah, that doesn't surprise me.

21:55.381 --> 21:56.614
What most people throw away

21:56.616 --> 21:57.782
In trash bags is actually

21:57.784 --> 21:59.784
Biodegradable or recyclable.

21:59.786 --> 22:01.852
Unnecessarily taking up
the precious space

22:01.854 --> 22:04.088
In our rapidly
diminishing landfills.

22:04.090 --> 22:06.524
Hey, don't look at me--
I recycle.

22:06.526 --> 22:09.360
I've started

22:09.362 --> 22:13.364
Recording my garbage
in a trash journal.

22:13.366 --> 22:16.834
So now, I discard no more
than three pounds per week.

22:16.836 --> 22:17.802
You have a trash journal?

22:17.804 --> 22:20.071
Yeah.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.673
This looks like a contract

22:22.675 --> 22:24.008
For a storage unit.

22:26.411 --> 22:28.546
"maybrook storage."

22:28.548 --> 22:31.549
Rented to "doug adamson"?

22:31.551 --> 22:33.451
February 19, 2014.

22:33.453 --> 22:36.454
It's the morning after he had
a sleepover at the conner house.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.689
"unit 353."

22:38.691 --> 22:41.659
Why would doug adamson need
a storage unit?

22:44.363 --> 22:46.030
"353."

22:50.635 --> 22:52.670
Ugh...

22:52.672 --> 22:54.772
Hard to mistake that smell.

23:08.587 --> 23:10.654
Finlay:
There's a lot of blood.

23:22.701 --> 23:24.769
Inside is empty.

23:26.605 --> 23:28.906
Keys are still in the ignition.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.975
(car door shuts)

23:33.578 --> 23:34.645
Finn.

23:40.685 --> 23:42.553
Dwight conner.

23:44.122 --> 23:47.591
Where's the rest
of the conner family?

23:52.497 --> 23:54.732
(distant siren wailing)

23:57.636 --> 23:59.170
I.D. Confirms that

23:59.172 --> 24:00.504
This is the dad--

24:00.506 --> 24:01.539
Dwight conner.

24:01.541 --> 24:02.840
Large volume of blood

24:02.842 --> 24:04.542
Tells us that
he was killed here.

24:04.544 --> 24:07.044
Based on the castoff,

24:07.046 --> 24:09.647
He was struck multiple times.

24:10.816 --> 24:12.183
No kidding.

24:12.185 --> 24:14.718
Mr. Conner's skull is in,
like, a million pieces.

24:17.556 --> 24:20.658
There are bone fragments
embedded in the wood.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.593
Doug must've been really angry.

24:22.595 --> 24:24.161
(grunts)

24:48.220 --> 24:50.521
Confirmed blood in the trunk.

24:50.523 --> 24:52.623
Did you find any blood
in the rest of the car?

24:52.625 --> 24:54.592
Not a drop.
Hmm.

24:56.061 --> 24:57.995
Dna match.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.531
Blood in the house,
female donor.

25:00.533 --> 25:01.799
(sighs heavily)

25:03.635 --> 25:07.037
Okay, so, either claire
or heather conner

25:07.039 --> 25:08.806
Was killed at the house...

25:08.808 --> 25:11.976
Then put into the trunk
of the car,

25:11.978 --> 25:14.044
The body dumped somewhere,

25:14.046 --> 25:16.180
Then mr. Conner
was driven here

25:16.182 --> 25:18.649
To this storage unit,
where he was killed.

25:18.651 --> 25:19.817
That means that dwight conner

25:19.819 --> 25:21.285
Was with the killer
when he got rid

25:21.287 --> 25:22.520
Of the body in the trunk.

25:22.522 --> 25:25.623
Dead weight is heavy.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.558
Maybe the killer needed
conner's help.

25:31.696 --> 25:35.165
Brody: Looks like there's tar on
the passenger side of the car.

25:35.167 --> 25:37.234
They must've picked it up

25:37.236 --> 25:39.770
Around the time
mr. Conner was killed.

25:41.773 --> 25:44.275
Means the car was driven
over a freshly paved road.

25:45.577 --> 25:46.844
Find the road, maybe we'll find

25:46.846 --> 25:48.879
The rest of the conner family.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.247
How many times do
I have to tell you?

25:50.249 --> 25:52.583
I never rented
any storage locker.

25:52.585 --> 25:53.784
How else do you explain

25:53.786 --> 25:55.686
These photos, doug?
They were taken

25:55.688 --> 25:58.122
At maybrook storage
at 9:35 a.M.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.057
The same day the conner family
went missing.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.592
I was digging trenches
in the conner's yard

26:01.594 --> 26:03.127
That whole morning.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.328
That is not me.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.963
The shirt you're
wearing in the photo

26:05.965 --> 26:08.299
Is the same one I collected
from you at the hospital.

26:08.301 --> 26:11.201
I can't be the only guy in
the world who likes plaid, man.

26:11.203 --> 26:13.704
Dwight conner was found dead

26:13.706 --> 26:16.640
In a storage locker
that you rented.

26:16.642 --> 26:18.676
With his head bashed in
by a baseball bat.

26:18.678 --> 26:21.845
Conner's wife, claire, and
their two children are missing.

26:21.847 --> 26:25.783
Blood is spattered
all over their house.

26:25.785 --> 26:28.185
The same house you
were squatting in.

26:28.187 --> 26:31.355
I told you, they invited me
to live with them.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.691
(door opens)
brass:
Okay, doug, so you're telling me

26:33.693 --> 26:35.292
That you never saw any
of the conner family before?

26:35.294 --> 26:36.894
That's what I keep telling you.

26:36.896 --> 26:38.963
You're lying, doug.

26:38.965 --> 26:42.232
You and ethan conner were
on a 72-hour psych hold

26:42.234 --> 26:44.234
In the same facility
on the same day.

26:44.236 --> 26:47.605
He was there for an o.D.
You were for medical detox.

26:47.607 --> 26:49.607
So?
So, there's only
ten people in the unit!

26:49.609 --> 26:51.342
You're telling me
you never even saw the guy?

26:51.344 --> 26:53.043
Nope.
So it's just a coincidence

26:53.045 --> 26:55.679
That ethan offered you
a job at their house

26:55.681 --> 26:57.748
And his whole family
may be dead?

26:57.750 --> 27:00.351
Look, I'm not saying
I'm a saint.

27:00.353 --> 27:03.387
Okay? I've been an addict
since I was 13.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.656
Alcohol, coke, meth,
you name it.

27:05.658 --> 27:08.659
But I have never hurt anybody.

27:08.661 --> 27:11.362
Admit it-- you'll do anything
to feed your habit.

27:11.364 --> 27:13.697
Even kill.

27:18.169 --> 27:20.804
If we charge you
for this crime,

27:20.806 --> 27:22.673
You're looking at murder.

27:22.675 --> 27:24.208
You know what that means?

27:24.210 --> 27:26.710
So do yourself a favor.

27:26.712 --> 27:29.747
Tell us where the rest
of the conner family is,

27:29.749 --> 27:31.849
And maybe we can cut a deal.

27:31.851 --> 27:33.951
I'm done talking.

27:35.286 --> 27:36.787
I want a lawyer.

27:42.727 --> 27:47.031
Okay, so, I've got some
dna results here for you.

27:47.033 --> 27:49.767
The unknown male dna
that we found in the house

27:49.769 --> 27:51.835
Is a match to mr. Conner here.

27:51.837 --> 27:56.306
And then killed in the,
in the storage unit.

27:56.308 --> 27:57.941
And then henry compared
mr. Conner's dna

27:57.943 --> 28:00.344
Against the unknown
female blood.

28:00.346 --> 28:01.779
There were no markers in common.

28:01.781 --> 28:05.816
She they're definitely
not related in any way.

28:05.818 --> 28:08.752
So, it wasn't the daughter
that was killed in the house,

28:08.754 --> 28:10.020
It was the wife.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.755
Which is interesting.

28:11.757 --> 28:15.359
By his boss braxton
for embezzling, right?

28:15.361 --> 28:19.129
Brass confirmed that it was
a lump sum electronic deposit

28:19.131 --> 28:21.965
Of a half-million dollars.
So, what if,

28:21.967 --> 28:24.001
What if braxton
or one of his goons

28:24.003 --> 28:26.136
Forced dwight here

28:26.138 --> 28:29.073
To watch his loved
ones being murdered

28:29.075 --> 28:30.874
Before he himself
was beaten to death?

28:30.876 --> 28:32.076
Except we still haven't found

28:32.078 --> 28:34.378
A link between braxton and doug.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.447
We do know
that doug knew ethan.

28:36.449 --> 28:38.315
They were both addicts.

28:38.317 --> 28:41.819
Maybe this was some kind
of drug deal gone wrong.

28:41.821 --> 28:42.820
And the family was just

28:42.822 --> 28:44.288
Collateral damage.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.890
Boy, beautiful wife,

28:46.892 --> 28:48.092
Two kids, a dog.

28:48.094 --> 28:50.094
<i>I mean, I bet they seemed like</i>

28:50.096 --> 28:52.996
The perfect american family.

28:52.998 --> 28:54.798
Nothing's ever
what it seems, is it?

28:54.800 --> 28:56.834
No, it's not.

29:00.772 --> 29:02.506
So, did you, uh,

29:02.508 --> 29:04.508
Did you already make a note
on the trace on these pants?

29:04.510 --> 29:06.844
The reddish dust?
I figured it was

29:06.846 --> 29:08.812
Soil or crushed brick.

29:10.348 --> 29:12.783
It's embedded in the tread
of his shoe as well.

29:12.785 --> 29:15.419
You know, if the killer used
dwight to help dispose

29:15.421 --> 29:17.755
Of the other bodies,
he could've picked

29:17.757 --> 29:19.890
That stuff up from
where they were buried.

29:21.159 --> 29:24.895
Are you familiar
with the mesozoic era?

29:24.897 --> 29:25.863
The age of reptiles?

29:25.865 --> 29:26.864
Ah, I see
someone paid attention

29:26.866 --> 29:27.865
During earth science class.

29:27.867 --> 29:30.000
The mesozoic era was

29:30.002 --> 29:31.535
250 million years ago,
during a time

29:31.537 --> 29:34.171
In which nevada's landscape

29:34.173 --> 29:37.040
Was developing formations
of salt and gypsum.

29:37.042 --> 29:39.276
As the years passed,
oxidization gave

29:39.278 --> 29:42.412
These formations
a beautiful crimson hue,

29:42.414 --> 29:45.449
Creating what we now know
as red rock canyon.

29:45.451 --> 29:46.450
The red powder that nick found

29:46.452 --> 29:48.552
On mr. Conner's pants and shoes.

29:48.554 --> 29:49.887
Secluded.

29:49.889 --> 29:51.054
A perfect place for a killer

29:51.056 --> 29:52.523
To bury the rest of the family.

29:52.525 --> 29:56.059
Still, that's over
100,000 acres.

29:56.061 --> 29:58.395
Actually, over 200,000.

29:58.397 --> 29:59.897
Right.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.498
You know, I did find some tar

30:01.500 --> 30:04.001
On the passenger side
of the suv.

30:04.003 --> 30:07.304
Means the killer drove
over a freshly paved road.

30:07.306 --> 30:08.906
So, we're looking
for an area of red rock

30:08.908 --> 30:10.841
Near a road that was paved
about a month ago.

30:10.843 --> 30:12.109
Yeah.

30:12.111 --> 30:13.811
Good.

30:13.813 --> 30:14.912
Hey, it's brody.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.313
(quietly):
Thanks.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.949
Can you get me the
department of transportation?

30:18.951 --> 30:21.018
(engine revving)

30:26.891 --> 30:28.959
♪

30:58.489 --> 31:00.057
I think I got something.

31:02.961 --> 31:05.229
Could be a body.

31:05.231 --> 31:06.997
Yeah, okay, let's start digging.

31:06.999 --> 31:09.199
Okay, everybody,
let's bring it in!

31:09.201 --> 31:10.300
Looks like
we got a body.

31:11.936 --> 31:14.004
♪

31:26.951 --> 31:30.020
Found some kind of fabric.

31:33.925 --> 31:35.926
That's the missing curtain

31:35.928 --> 31:36.994
From the conner house.

31:37.929 --> 31:39.296
Okay.

31:48.606 --> 31:50.507
Definitely female.

31:52.110 --> 31:54.177
Stokes:
Badly mummified.

31:55.546 --> 31:58.115
You think it's mrs. Conner?

31:58.117 --> 31:59.516
Yeah, either that
or her daughter.

32:00.485 --> 32:02.085
(sighs)

32:09.127 --> 32:10.928
Hey.
Hey, finn.

32:10.930 --> 32:12.663
So, nick and morgan
are still out there,

32:12.665 --> 32:14.331
But they haven't found
any other bodies.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.466
I'm just finishing up
with our victim here.

32:16.468 --> 32:19.036
Finlay:
Ligature marks on her wrist

32:19.038 --> 32:20.570
Confirms she was restrained.

32:20.572 --> 32:22.940
Multiple contusions
to the head as well.

32:22.942 --> 32:24.074
Was that the cause of death?

32:24.076 --> 32:25.642
Subarachnoid hemorrhage

32:25.644 --> 32:27.544
Caused by blunt-force trauma.

32:27.546 --> 32:30.981
The weapon cracked the skull,
but it didn't perforate it.

32:30.983 --> 32:33.650
Suggests that the killer didn't
have much upper-body strength.

32:33.652 --> 32:35.319
Were you able to narrow down

32:35.321 --> 32:36.987
What the weapon was?
Something heavy.

32:36.989 --> 32:39.122
An inch or less in diameter.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.958
Could it have been
a fireplace poker?

32:40.960 --> 32:42.392
That's consistent
with her injuries.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.394
There was one missing
from the house.

32:44.396 --> 32:45.395
(door opens, closes)

32:45.397 --> 32:47.698
The victim's x-rays.

32:50.401 --> 32:52.035
Finlay:
Is that an iud?

32:52.037 --> 32:54.338
Robbins: I did remove
an intrauterine device

32:54.340 --> 32:56.173
During autopsy.

32:56.175 --> 32:58.342
According
to their medical records,

32:58.344 --> 33:01.144
Claire conner had a hysterectomy
five years ago.

33:01.146 --> 33:04.214
That means
this is not claire conner.

33:06.317 --> 33:09.686
And heather was never
prescribed birth control.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.555
So it's not the daughter,
either.

33:13.424 --> 33:16.093
Who is this woman?

33:19.497 --> 33:21.064
Hey.
Hmm?

33:21.066 --> 33:23.133
You know the great thing
about iuds?

33:23.135 --> 33:25.002
Besides the obvious?

33:25.004 --> 33:26.603
They have serial numbers.

33:26.605 --> 33:29.272
Meet jessica fenton,

33:29.274 --> 33:32.709
Our mystery woman
buried in red rock.

33:32.711 --> 33:35.779
Her dna matched
the female blood in the house.

33:35.781 --> 33:37.514
That's interesting.

33:37.516 --> 33:41.151
So ms. Fenton here was killed
at the conner house,

33:41.153 --> 33:43.387
Then put in the back
of their suv,

33:43.389 --> 33:44.654
Driven out to red rock

33:44.656 --> 33:46.723
And buried.
Do we know why?

33:46.725 --> 33:48.525
I mean, what's the connection
to the family?

33:48.527 --> 33:52.562
She was an I.T. Specialist,
worked from home.

33:52.564 --> 33:55.132
Landlord reported her missing
when she didn't pay her rent.

33:55.134 --> 33:56.466
Nick just recovered her laptop,

33:56.468 --> 33:58.201
So he's going through it
right now.

33:59.070 --> 34:02.305
(passionate breathing,
laughter)

34:03.241 --> 34:06.109
(sighs)

34:06.111 --> 34:08.078
Is that dwight conner
in a sex tape?

34:08.080 --> 34:09.813
Oh, yeah, but not with his wife.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.748
This was taken
three months ago.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.784
Looks like
he and our victim

34:13.786 --> 34:17.387
From the red rock were, uh,
having a little fun on the side.

34:17.389 --> 34:18.588
She's totally playing it
to the camera.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.490
Oh, yeah, but I
don't even think

34:20.492 --> 34:22.225
He knows it's there.

34:22.227 --> 34:23.794
And check this out.

34:23.796 --> 34:25.562
Jessica fenton's hard drive

34:25.564 --> 34:27.497
Was filled with hundreds
of these photos.

34:27.499 --> 34:29.800
All of conner and
his wife and kids.

34:31.569 --> 34:33.537
Claire conner was right--

34:33.539 --> 34:35.238
Someone was stalking
their family.

34:35.240 --> 34:36.706
Yeah, but it all happened
pretty fast.

34:36.708 --> 34:40.110
I mean, the affair happened
in December.

34:40.112 --> 34:43.280
She goes
all <i>fatal attraction</i> on him,

34:43.282 --> 34:44.815
Breaks into his house,

34:44.817 --> 34:48.819
And then kills the family pet
after treating it like that.

34:50.121 --> 34:52.222
And that's cold-blooded.
Well, she also tried

34:52.224 --> 34:55.392
I found diagonal cutters
at her house.

34:55.394 --> 34:59.796
Liquid on the hinge smells
and looks like brake fluid.

34:59.798 --> 35:02.232
Okay, all this time,
we have been thinking

35:02.234 --> 35:04.367
That this entire family is dead.

35:04.369 --> 35:05.869
Maybe we're wrong.

35:05.871 --> 35:08.738
The cheating husband,
the mistress-- both dead--

35:08.740 --> 35:12.209
But who's the most
obvious suspect right now?

35:12.211 --> 35:13.243
Claire conner. I mean,

35:13.245 --> 35:14.678
If she found out
about the affair,

35:14.680 --> 35:16.313
She could've killed them both.

35:16.315 --> 35:17.214
Stokes:
Yeah, and then what?

35:17.216 --> 35:19.249
Just grabs her kids and...

35:19.251 --> 35:21.184
Gets the hell out of dodge?

35:23.121 --> 35:24.621
Brass:
<i>I gotta say,</i>

35:24.623 --> 35:27.157
Dwight conner picked the
wrong woman to mess with

35:27.159 --> 35:28.492
With jessica fenton.

35:28.494 --> 35:30.460
She used her computer skills
to hack

35:30.462 --> 35:31.628
Into the company server

35:31.630 --> 35:33.130
And then transferred
half a million bucks

35:33.132 --> 35:34.764
Into his private bank account.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.333
She got him fired.

35:36.335 --> 35:38.201
Yeah.
Yeah, and as if
that wasn't enough,

35:38.203 --> 35:40.670
Nick found evidence
that she contacted the wife

35:40.672 --> 35:42.205
And gave her the sex tape.

35:42.207 --> 35:44.141
Russell:
Proving that claire conner

35:44.143 --> 35:45.308
Knew about the affair.

35:45.310 --> 35:46.243
Yeah, and she also knew

35:46.245 --> 35:47.377
Who was threatening her family.

35:47.379 --> 35:48.912
Nick also found an e-mail

35:48.914 --> 35:51.882
From claire to ms. Fenton
on February 18

35:51.884 --> 35:53.416
Saying, "we need to talk."

35:53.418 --> 35:56.486
That was one day before
the family went missing.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.255
Which explains
why jessica fenton

35:58.257 --> 36:00.157
Was at the conner house
in the first place.

36:00.159 --> 36:04.361
Claire conner confronts
her husband's mistress.

36:04.363 --> 36:06.163
Mm-hmm.
Things escalate.

36:06.165 --> 36:07.397
Claire hits her.

36:07.399 --> 36:09.366
Jessica falls down.

36:09.368 --> 36:11.401
(panting)

36:11.403 --> 36:13.670
Do you like the tape I made
with your husband?

36:13.672 --> 36:14.838
Russell: <i>Obviously,</i>
<i>the rest of the conversation</i>

36:14.840 --> 36:16.306
<i>Did not go very well.</i>

36:16.308 --> 36:17.407
Get off me!

36:20.811 --> 36:22.379
(screaming)

36:22.381 --> 36:24.314
And we also know
that dwight conner's blood

36:24.316 --> 36:26.216
Was found at the scene,
so at some point,

36:26.218 --> 36:27.817
He came in there to try
to intervene.

36:27.819 --> 36:30.387
What the hell are you doing?!
Stop!

36:30.389 --> 36:31.655
Claire:
Give me it.

36:31.657 --> 36:34.357
No!
(groans)

36:34.359 --> 36:37.494
So now, claire and dwight conner

36:37.496 --> 36:39.696
Have a body
in their living room.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.365
Okay, they have two options:
They can call the cops

36:42.367 --> 36:43.967
Or cover it up.

36:43.969 --> 36:45.869
They chose the latter.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.605
They wrapped her in a curtain,
put her in the back of a car,

36:48.607 --> 36:50.407
And buried her out at red rock.

36:50.409 --> 36:52.342
And they drove
to the storage place,

36:52.344 --> 36:54.511
Where claire conner
killed her husband.

36:54.513 --> 36:57.247
Okay, that all
makes sense, right?

36:59.584 --> 37:02.385
Except for the storage locker.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.588
I mean, we know
that doug adamson rented it.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.656
We got him on surveillance.

37:06.658 --> 37:09.226
So how's he fit
into all of this?

37:09.228 --> 37:12.829
It's a strong possibility
that the person on that tape

37:12.831 --> 37:14.531
Was not doug, but someone
that looked like him.

37:14.533 --> 37:16.399
There's no physical evidence
that he was there.

37:16.401 --> 37:17.667
Okay.

37:17.669 --> 37:18.835
Any evidence of the wife?

37:18.837 --> 37:20.537
No. No dna from her, either.

37:20.539 --> 37:23.306
Well, so then what are you
so excited about, henry?

37:23.308 --> 37:24.507
Dwight conner fought
his attacker.

37:24.509 --> 37:26.009
I found tissue under his nails.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.377
And you have the dna results?

37:27.379 --> 37:30.380
Y-strs match mr. Conner.

37:30.382 --> 37:32.349
A male relative?

37:32.351 --> 37:34.351
So dwight conner was killed

37:34.353 --> 37:35.285
By his son

37:35.287 --> 37:36.419
In the storage unit.

37:36.421 --> 37:37.754
And I think I know why.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.589
I found evidence
of sexual activity

37:39.591 --> 37:41.458
On jessica fenton's underwear.

37:41.460 --> 37:45.028
It was an admixture of her dna
and that same male profile.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.863
Uh, all right.

37:46.865 --> 37:48.331
So, the son,

37:48.333 --> 37:49.833
<i>Ethan,</i>

37:49.835 --> 37:51.001
Was having an affair

37:51.003 --> 37:52.669
With his father's mistress.

37:52.671 --> 37:54.738
You said jessica fenton
was trying

37:54.740 --> 37:57.507
To destroy dwight conner's
family-- maybe, maybe

37:57.509 --> 37:59.042
Seducing the son
was part of that plan.

37:59.044 --> 38:02.345
Right. Ethan finds out
that she's just using him,

38:02.347 --> 38:04.047
Maybe even tried to kill him.

38:04.049 --> 38:05.315
He takes his rage out

38:05.317 --> 38:07.951
On his father.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.553
And now he and his mother
and his sister

38:10.555 --> 38:11.888
Are in the wind.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.056
Brody:
Russell?

38:13.058 --> 38:14.591
Yeah.
You have a minute?

38:14.593 --> 38:18.061
So, I traced the
mistress's credit cards.

38:18.063 --> 38:21.698
One of them was used to
buy three bus tickets

38:21.700 --> 38:23.500
To prescott, arizona.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.835
Claire conner
and her two kids, right?

38:25.837 --> 38:28.305
Right. Next day, same card
was used to book a room

38:28.307 --> 38:29.339
At an extended stay hotel.

38:29.341 --> 38:31.308
Hasn't been used since.

38:31.310 --> 38:32.942
Are they still there?

38:32.944 --> 38:35.045
Brass contacted prescott pd,
but when they got to the room,

38:35.047 --> 38:36.846
The only one there was heather,
the daughter.

38:36.848 --> 38:39.549
The daughter?
Yeah.

38:44.088 --> 38:46.656
I haven't seen mom or ethan
in two weeks.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.425
Why didn't you call the police?

38:48.427 --> 38:50.093
I didn't want
to get them in trouble.

38:50.095 --> 38:51.795
Well, I mean, they're
already in trouble.

38:51.797 --> 38:53.396
Your mother killed
jessica fenton.

38:54.832 --> 38:57.033
Your brother k-killed your...

38:57.035 --> 38:58.368
My father.

38:58.370 --> 39:00.070
I know.

39:01.639 --> 39:03.773
Were you in the house when
jessica fenton was murdered?

39:03.775 --> 39:04.908
No.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.810
No, I just came home,

39:06.812 --> 39:08.378
And I saw that...

39:08.380 --> 39:10.347
She was lying there,

39:10.349 --> 39:11.981
Dead.

39:11.983 --> 39:15.385
And there was blood
all over the floor.

39:15.387 --> 39:17.554
Ethan: What did you do?!
(screams)

39:17.556 --> 39:19.422
What were you thinking, mom?

39:19.424 --> 39:20.523
Claire:
You don't understand.

39:20.525 --> 39:22.459
She was never gonna stop.

39:22.461 --> 39:23.793
Who is she?
Ask your father.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.128
This is all his fault.

39:25.130 --> 39:26.663
We have to call the police.
No, no, no, no.

39:26.665 --> 39:27.964
No one's calling
the police, honey.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.132
Dad, we have to!

39:29.134 --> 39:32.569
We're gonna clean this up,
and we're gonna disappear

39:32.571 --> 39:33.770
As a family.

39:33.772 --> 39:35.505
It's okay.

39:35.507 --> 39:37.507
Nobody ever asks me what I want.

39:37.509 --> 39:39.576
People just make decisions
in my life,

39:39.578 --> 39:40.777
And I get no say.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.812
And now,
because of my parents,

39:42.814 --> 39:45.048
I don't ever get to see
my friends again.

39:45.050 --> 39:47.450
What about your brother?

39:47.452 --> 39:49.018
He was part of the plan.

39:49.020 --> 39:52.822
And how did he track down
that vagrant, doug?

39:54.759 --> 39:56.760
Ethan remembered him
from the mini-mart.

39:56.762 --> 39:58.395
(sniffles)

39:58.397 --> 39:59.929
He said every morning
he would be there,

39:59.931 --> 40:01.464
Looking through
the dumpsters for food.

40:01.466 --> 40:02.665
We found him right away.

40:02.667 --> 40:03.833
And your mother and brother

40:03.835 --> 40:05.502
Invited him to stay
at the house?

40:05.504 --> 40:08.037
Dad thought it was better if...

40:08.039 --> 40:10.573
People thought we were dead.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.976
You find some weird homeless guy
living there,

40:12.978 --> 40:15.512
And everybody would think
that he killed us.

40:15.514 --> 40:17.046
(grunts)

40:17.048 --> 40:19.849
Boy, your dad thought
he had it all figured out, huh?

40:19.851 --> 40:21.851
My dad and ethan went
to drop off the car,

40:21.853 --> 40:24.587
But only ethan came back
and met us at the bus station.

40:25.524 --> 40:29.492
When you saw the blood,
did you ask him what happened?

40:29.494 --> 40:31.127
No.

40:31.129 --> 40:33.062
He just said we were better off
without dad.

40:34.632 --> 40:37.801
Honestly,
none of this would have happened

40:37.803 --> 40:40.036
If he had just kept it
in his pants.

40:40.038 --> 40:42.639
(sighs)

40:42.641 --> 40:46.643
So your family decided to...

40:46.645 --> 40:49.579
Take matters
into their own hands?

40:49.581 --> 40:50.880
Yes.

40:50.882 --> 40:53.616
My family ruined my life.

40:53.618 --> 40:55.919
Then why protect them?

40:57.488 --> 40:58.955
I'm not.
Tell me where your mother

40:58.957 --> 41:00.023
And brother are.

41:00.025 --> 41:01.724
I said I don't know.

41:01.726 --> 41:03.960
Come on, heather.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.663
You don't know where
your mother and brother are?

41:06.665 --> 41:08.731
No!

41:14.104 --> 41:16.139
I don't believe you.

41:21.712 --> 41:24.113
People don't just vanish.

41:30.654 --> 41:33.923
They said they were going
to see a movie,

41:33.925 --> 41:36.726
And I haven't seen them since.
