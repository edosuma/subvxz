01:06.900 --> 01:08.318
Who's there?

01:29.756 --> 01:32.592
Look, I'm warning you.
This is a restricted area.

01:32.675 --> 01:35.511
If I catch you, there goes your ride pass.

01:38.931 --> 01:40.349
Stupid kids.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.480
Look, I'm warning you.

03:58.236 --> 03:59.696
Car problems?

04:00.155 --> 04:02.282
Nothing seems to be going right today.

04:02.407 --> 04:04.659
Today would be a good day
to stay home and knit.

04:04.743 --> 04:08.037
Well, it all depends on
what kind of pattern you've bought.

04:10.415 --> 04:12.167
You got help coming?

04:13.501 --> 04:15.378
No. Not that I know of.

04:16.671 --> 04:18.589
Just checking, Miss Prince.

04:18.673 --> 04:22.343
It wouldn't do for you to have been
followed by one of your co-workers.

04:22.427 --> 04:23.553
Believe me...

04:23.636 --> 04:27.849
no one would suspect that it was me
who leaked that confidential file.

04:29.601 --> 04:33.354
It's going to be a pleasure dealing
with a double agent who's above reproach.

04:34.856 --> 04:39.027
Listen, it's taken me
four very long years...

04:39.485 --> 04:42.113
to build up a sterling reputation
with the IADC...

04:42.196 --> 04:44.907
and I think it's about time it paid off.

04:48.286 --> 04:51.038
I take it, then, you are interested
in my latest offer?

04:51.122 --> 04:54.625
I couldn't care less about unscrambling
White House phone conversations.

04:54.709 --> 04:55.960
What?

04:56.377 --> 04:58.379
Somebody else is interested...

04:58.462 --> 05:00.756
to the tune of $100,000.

05:00.840 --> 05:01.883
Who?

05:02.049 --> 05:05.052
That isn't for you to know or find out.

05:06.053 --> 05:08.347
We're going to do everything
like we did it before.

05:08.431 --> 05:11.267
Only, instead of having one week
to get me the information...

05:11.350 --> 05:13.019
you have two days.

05:13.227 --> 05:14.478
Two days?

05:14.937 --> 05:16.313
Or no deal.

05:19.066 --> 05:23.237
There's only one person I know of
that likes to work that fast.

05:24.196 --> 05:25.448
Harrison Fynch.

05:27.366 --> 05:29.910
Come on, the IADC is very much aware...

05:29.994 --> 05:32.580
of Mr. Fynch's domestic spying operations.

05:32.663 --> 05:36.000
They just don't know what,
when, where, or how.

05:47.261 --> 05:48.554
That should do it, lady.

05:48.637 --> 05:50.764
Do everything I told you,
and you'll be all set.

05:50.848 --> 05:53.434
I think I deserve to know
who I'm selling to.

05:53.517 --> 05:56.854
You just be real careful,
and that baby will take you 100,000 miles.

05:56.937 --> 05:57.980
Yes, sir.

09:19.555 --> 09:21.807
- How did you do that?
- That?

09:22.683 --> 09:24.935
You haven't seen anything yet.

09:25.894 --> 09:29.523
Is it Harrison Fynch that wants to buy
the information from Diana Prince?

09:29.606 --> 09:31.316
- Yes.
- Where is he?

09:31.400 --> 09:34.528
All I know is that he is setting up
a surveillance operation here.

09:34.653 --> 09:37.781
- Here? In Washington?
- Yes.

09:39.699 --> 09:42.411
Who's your contact
in Fynch's organization?

09:42.494 --> 09:43.870
I'm meeting with a man.

09:43.954 --> 09:47.791
Well, somebody's going to meet him,
I'm afraid it won't be you.

09:47.874 --> 09:49.000
Now, who is he?

09:49.084 --> 09:51.586
And where is this little rendezvous
to take place?

09:51.711 --> 09:55.423
A man with a crutch.
A cafeteria at Eighth and Curtis.

09:55.507 --> 09:56.800
Password?

09:56.883 --> 10:00.345
"The pound cake's stale,
so why don't you try the apple pie?"

10:42.637 --> 10:44.138
Harris...

10:44.305 --> 10:46.766
Fynch. Harrison Fynch.

10:48.476 --> 10:49.686
Thank you.

10:49.769 --> 10:53.981
Right. Harrison Fynch.
Sorry, I got a mind like a sieve.

10:54.065 --> 10:56.401
My secretary says
I drink so much of this stuff...

10:56.484 --> 10:59.654
it just flushes everything
right out of my brain.

10:59.779 --> 11:03.241
Let's see now, you're here to discuss...
What is it...

11:03.658 --> 11:05.117
insurance?

11:05.368 --> 11:08.663
I'm here to discuss
buying your amusement park, Mr. Gurney.

11:10.164 --> 11:12.708
Well, that's easy. It's not for sale.

11:12.792 --> 11:15.378
Everything is for sale, Mr. Gurney.

11:15.628 --> 11:18.381
Everything and everyone has a price.

11:18.673 --> 11:20.049
I don't want to sell.

11:20.132 --> 11:23.594
- Perhaps not at this moment.
- No. Not at any moment.

11:23.844 --> 11:25.054
Look...

11:26.347 --> 11:29.058
my brother and I dreamed
about owning a place like this...

11:29.141 --> 11:31.560
ever since we were little kids
in kindergarten.

11:31.644 --> 11:35.481
Davey, that's my brother, he thought up
practically half the rides in this place.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.441
You seen that Super Loop back there?

11:37.525 --> 11:38.776
Davey designed that.

11:38.859 --> 11:41.654
American history class,
our junior year in high school.

11:41.737 --> 11:44.406
When that Super Loop was installed here
three years ago...

11:44.490 --> 11:46.575
it put this place right on the map.

11:46.659 --> 11:50.037
So, it was your brother David
who designed that Super Loop?

11:50.621 --> 11:51.830
Right.

11:52.122 --> 11:55.125
Might almost say
that, in order to make history...

11:55.209 --> 11:56.877
old Davey had to flunk it.

11:56.961 --> 12:00.130
Well, then, perhaps it's David
I should be speaking to.

12:00.673 --> 12:03.550
No, David's dead.
Missing in action in Vietnam.

12:03.634 --> 12:06.804
Look, what I'm trying to say, Mr. Fynch...

12:06.970 --> 12:09.932
is that I have no reason or desire to sell.

12:12.142 --> 12:14.770
Listen... As long as I'm up, please.

12:16.146 --> 12:19.858
Mr. Gurney, please
don't misunderstand me. I...

12:19.942 --> 12:23.946
The reason for my visit here today
is simply to let you know...

12:24.029 --> 12:28.325
that should a reason develop
for you to want to sell...

12:28.450 --> 12:30.452
sometime in the future...

12:30.869 --> 12:32.746
you have...

12:33.956 --> 12:35.916
a very eager...

12:36.875 --> 12:39.461
and a very qualified buyer
at your beck and call.

12:39.961 --> 12:42.798
I'll tell you again,
there's no way I'm ever going to sell.

12:42.881 --> 12:45.675
In spite of the migraines and the ulcers...

12:45.759 --> 12:48.678
I've got way too much
invested in this place.

12:50.305 --> 12:52.933
Well, thank you for your time, Mr. Gurney.

13:08.865 --> 13:11.242
Fynch plans to set up operations
in Washington?

13:11.326 --> 13:12.494
Sounds that way.

13:12.619 --> 13:14.704
The information that I was using
to bait him...

13:14.788 --> 13:16.873
is the kind he usually
likes to buy and sell.

13:16.956 --> 13:20.168
It's top-secret, exotic,
extremely valuable on the black market.

13:20.251 --> 13:23.546
But apparently, this time he was planning
on keeping what he bought...

13:23.630 --> 13:25.006
for himself.

13:25.673 --> 13:27.550
He intends to set up
some kind of system...

13:27.634 --> 13:29.594
to monitor
shortwave phone conversations.

13:29.677 --> 13:31.387
That's probably only part of his plan.

13:31.471 --> 13:34.599
With his expertise, he'll find a way
to monitor all communications.

13:34.682 --> 13:36.434
Having him headquartered
in Washington...

13:36.518 --> 13:38.728
is like having a shark
in a public swimming pool.

13:38.811 --> 13:40.021
You're not kidding.

13:40.104 --> 13:41.522
Before long, foreign countries...

13:41.606 --> 13:43.483
are gonna know more
about our government than we do.

13:43.566 --> 13:44.609
What you got, Beverly?

13:44.692 --> 13:47.403
You know, Steve, we've been trying
to bust this guy for three years.

13:47.487 --> 13:49.155
It's now or never.

13:49.322 --> 13:50.573
I'm going to check with Ira...

13:50.657 --> 13:53.451
see if he can come up with a lead
as to Fynch's next move...

13:53.534 --> 13:56.579
- now that we know his intentions.
- I think that's a good idea.

13:57.163 --> 13:58.873
Meanwhile, I've got-

14:00.917 --> 14:03.878
- How does he do that?
- What? Make those noises?

14:03.961 --> 14:07.089
No, get into rooms
when all the doors are closed.

14:07.465 --> 14:10.384
I don't know about you,
but I've been afraid to ask.

14:10.635 --> 14:12.220
Good. Come here.

14:19.393 --> 14:22.104
- Here it is.
- A 50-cent piece?

14:22.188 --> 14:25.149
It's a bug.
Something our lab boys dreamed up.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.151
Thanks to our friend Wonder Woman...

14:27.234 --> 14:31.030
I have a little rendezvous with one
of Fynch's operatives this afternoon.

14:31.113 --> 14:35.368
And this will give us a chance
to beat Harrison Fynch at his own game.

14:36.160 --> 14:40.664
And I'm going to cash in on my newly
established career as a double agent.

15:01.685 --> 15:05.189
You should learn to play chess, Mr. Pierce.
Wonderful for the mind.

15:05.272 --> 15:08.609
Are you kidding?
I have enough trouble with checkers.

15:10.027 --> 15:11.904
Hold all calls.

15:12.196 --> 15:15.115
- I'm only telling you What I saw.
- What you think you saw.

15:15.199 --> 15:17.451
What I saw!
And I'm not the only one, Mr. Gurney!

15:17.534 --> 15:20.454
Half the kids who work here
have seen it around the Super Loop.

15:20.537 --> 15:21.747
What did it do, maul you...

15:21.830 --> 15:25.334
carry off screaming patrons,
leave gigantic footprints in the concrete?

15:25.417 --> 15:26.460
No.

15:26.543 --> 15:29.713
But there's something
in this park that shouldn't be here.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.924
I saw it. It's real, and it's horrible.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.675
And it's wrong to keep it a secret.

15:33.759 --> 15:35.594
The only thing that I'm covering up...

15:35.677 --> 15:37.721
is the fact that I exercise poor judgment...

15:37.804 --> 15:39.723
when I hire guys like you to work.

15:39.806 --> 15:41.016
Now, you can this nonsense...

15:41.099 --> 15:45.020
or I'm going to give your job to somebody
with a little more respect for the truth.

15:45.103 --> 15:47.522
I resent being called a liar, Mr. Gurney.

15:47.814 --> 15:50.442
And I resent you spreading
the irresponsible rumor...

15:50.525 --> 15:53.820
that my Fun Universe is haunted
by some kind of depraved monster.

15:53.904 --> 15:56.198
The public and the press
are squirrelly enough...

15:56.281 --> 15:58.617
When it comes to amusement parks,
you understand?

15:58.992 --> 16:02.662
Someday you're going to be real sorry
you kept this thing a secret.

16:02.746 --> 16:05.916
And I intend to be around to say,
"I told you so. "

16:16.968 --> 16:19.763
Something strike you funny, Mr. Fynch?

16:20.555 --> 16:22.182
Yes, Mr. Pierce.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.059
I just discovered a way...

16:24.142 --> 16:27.937
to force Mr. Gurney to sell me
that amusement park of his.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.200
- Ms. Patrick?
- Yeah?

16:41.409 --> 16:44.495
I heard you're taking a bunch of kids
to Fun Universe.

16:44.579 --> 16:45.747
That's right.

16:46.164 --> 16:48.124
Can I go? Please?

16:48.333 --> 16:49.876
Oh, Randy...

16:50.543 --> 16:54.047
I could only wrangle
a limited number of free passes.

16:54.589 --> 16:56.841
I was going to take the younger children.

16:56.924 --> 16:59.594
You're going to need somebody
to help watch them.

16:59.677 --> 17:01.471
Well, Jeff is coming along.

17:01.804 --> 17:03.181
Let me do it.

17:03.848 --> 17:06.976
Jeff is older than you, Randy,
he's more responsible.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.560
I'm responsible!

17:08.728 --> 17:11.564
Please, Ms. Patrick.
He's been there before and I haven't.

17:11.731 --> 17:14.192
They've got roller coasters there,
three of them.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.737
You and your roller coasters.

17:18.112 --> 17:20.698
Look, I can watch the kids
just as good as he can.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.996
All right. We'll be leaving at 2:00 sharp.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.081
Yes, ma'am.

17:35.129 --> 17:38.674
- Sure I didn't give them to you?
- You said you'd take care of it yourself.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.926
I distinctly remember putting them
in a manila envelope.

17:41.010 --> 17:44.096
I'll write up some new passes,
the kids will just have to wait.

17:45.556 --> 17:47.308
All right, we got "O" for orphanage...

17:47.391 --> 17:49.560
Never mind, Mr. Gurney.
I'll take care of it.

17:49.643 --> 17:52.313
Nothing. "P."

17:53.397 --> 17:54.815
Patrick Home for Boys.

17:55.441 --> 17:58.110
Twelve ride passes. What did I tell you?

18:04.158 --> 18:06.452
- I'm telling you.
- Yeah, I know.

18:06.952 --> 18:08.996
Flushes everything right out ofmy brain.

18:09.079 --> 18:13.083
It appears our friend Mr. Gurney
is a bit of a philanthropist.

18:14.793 --> 18:18.714
I'll have to remember that
when I take over his amusement park.

18:19.256 --> 18:20.924
Good for my image.

18:27.306 --> 18:29.224
Your move, Mr. Pierce.

18:31.727 --> 18:33.604
Like I said, Mr. F...

18:34.479 --> 18:37.649
checkers is hard enough.
I don't get this game.

18:37.733 --> 18:38.859
Play.

18:40.485 --> 18:43.030
When is your appointment, by the way?

18:43.113 --> 18:46.074
Told Thorpe I'd meet him
in about half an hour.

19:11.057 --> 19:13.018
Randy, come on.

20:06.863 --> 20:10.867
The pound cake is stale,
why don't you try the apple pie?

20:17.039 --> 20:19.250
I had the apple pie yesterday.

20:20.084 --> 20:21.794
It's not that good.

20:22.378 --> 20:26.257
I know you expected the password
to be given by a man, Mr. Pierce.

20:28.426 --> 20:30.595
But When I have information to sell...

20:31.762 --> 20:33.848
I don't use a go-between.

20:49.155 --> 20:51.115
I don't know what you're talking about...

20:51.449 --> 20:52.825
Diana.

20:54.410 --> 20:55.870
Why don't you have a seat?

20:55.995 --> 20:58.455
Okay, so you know who I am,
and I know who you are.

21:00.457 --> 21:02.251
You must also know...

21:02.334 --> 21:05.129
what kind of information I have to sell you.

21:05.963 --> 21:07.131
Not interested.

21:07.965 --> 21:10.634
Well, Mr. Fynch might think differently.

21:12.720 --> 21:15.306
After all, Thorpe did trust me enough...

21:15.389 --> 21:18.892
to allow me to take his place
at this little rendezvous.

21:21.311 --> 21:24.481
My boss likes things done his way.

21:25.149 --> 21:27.568
Your being here in person
isn't part ofhis plan.

21:28.610 --> 21:29.987
So...

21:35.492 --> 21:36.743
Pleasure.

21:42.666 --> 21:44.001
Excuse me, sir.

21:44.793 --> 21:46.837
You have left your change.

21:59.891 --> 22:01.143
Got him.

22:01.935 --> 22:05.355
Let's arrange a meeting so that you can
at least talk to Fynch. Okay?

22:06.106 --> 22:08.358
Let's just say the deal's off.

22:09.943 --> 22:11.319
Thanks, lady.

22:27.210 --> 22:28.586
Ms. Patrick?

22:29.921 --> 22:32.090
Tommy says he lost his ride pass.

22:32.173 --> 22:34.342
He said the string broke and it blew away.

22:34.426 --> 22:35.885
He must have been playing with it.

22:36.344 --> 22:38.388
Where were you
when this happened, Randy?

22:38.471 --> 22:41.391
You're supposed to be watching them,
that's why you're along.

22:41.850 --> 22:44.769
Look, just tell me where to go
and I'll get him another one.

22:44.853 --> 22:46.563
Those passes were donated to us.

22:46.646 --> 22:49.357
I'm not going to have the park owner
think we're taking advantage...

22:49.440 --> 22:51.067
by asking for another one.

22:51.234 --> 22:54.946
Tommy is just going to have to suffer
the consequences of your unreliability.

22:55.655 --> 22:56.865
My...

22:59.242 --> 23:02.704
Here, take mine.

23:02.787 --> 23:05.957
But you so much as touch it,
I'll break your arms.

23:06.416 --> 23:09.836
- Now, tell me. Which way did yours blow?
- That way.

23:11.254 --> 23:13.006
I'll be right back.

23:14.465 --> 23:16.134
You better go on
and catch up with the others...

23:16.217 --> 23:18.803
so you don't get lost
and I get blamed for that, too.

24:38.006 --> 24:39.508
Hey...

24:40.968 --> 24:42.636
is anybody there?

24:54.398 --> 24:56.191
Is anybody down here?

25:03.699 --> 25:05.784
I'll never get out of here.

25:19.339 --> 25:21.007
Is somebody there?

25:57.335 --> 25:59.128
Is anybody down here?

26:29.992 --> 26:31.202
Hello?

26:31.953 --> 26:33.120
Yeah.

26:34.038 --> 26:36.457
Diana, lunch is ready. Come on in.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.504
- Listen to this.
- We got a feed?

26:41.629 --> 26:44.715
I take back all the rotten things
I ever said about the lab boys.

26:44.799 --> 26:46.592
That 50-cent piece works like a charm.

26:46.676 --> 26:49.470
- Great, is the tape rolling?
- Sure is. Let's eat.

26:52.973 --> 26:56.268
But it wasn't Thorpe who showed up.
It was that Prince woman herself.

26:56.977 --> 26:58.396
Good pickles.

26:58.479 --> 27:01.023
Said she didn't need any middleman.

27:01.941 --> 27:03.901
I told her to forget it...

27:04.318 --> 27:06.612
you don't do business that way.

27:07.196 --> 27:09.323
He must be talking to Fynch.

27:11.408 --> 27:13.369
Then I got out of there.

27:13.702 --> 27:15.746
I'll tell you something, though.

27:15.996 --> 27:19.083
That Diana Prince is a heck of a lot
better-looking in real life...

27:19.166 --> 27:21.126
than she is in pictures.

27:22.586 --> 27:25.839
Well, I'm sure there are many people
outside the IADC...

27:25.923 --> 27:29.885
who can supply me with the technical
information I'll require, Mr. Pierce.

27:29.968 --> 27:31.762
Right now, however...

27:32.930 --> 27:34.431
you will find a bomb...

27:37.309 --> 27:39.186
Yeah, I can pick it up.

27:39.728 --> 27:41.688
I'm only about two miles from there.

27:43.023 --> 27:46.443
What kind of bomb is it,
and where do I plant it?

27:50.197 --> 27:51.281
Fine.

27:52.157 --> 27:53.659
But tell me...

27:54.201 --> 27:55.619
what is a Crazy Wheel?

27:57.704 --> 28:00.582
Mr. Pierce, it's a sort of a Ferris wheel.

28:00.916 --> 28:04.503
You'll find the name to be quite
appropriate once you've seen it.

28:04.711 --> 28:06.338
Poor Mr. Gurney.

28:07.756 --> 28:09.174
He's just discovered...

28:09.257 --> 28:12.052
a youngster has disappeared
from his amusement park.

28:13.720 --> 28:16.765
Last night, a monster,
today, a missing orphan...

28:17.224 --> 28:19.893
tomorrow, a terrible accident.

28:21.186 --> 28:25.565
It appears that bad luck
does run in threes, Mr. Pierce.

28:26.233 --> 28:29.152
Pretty soon he'll beg you to buy his place.

28:29.361 --> 28:31.655
Talk to you tomorrow, Mr. Fynch.

28:31.905 --> 28:33.657
After the noon news.

28:34.157 --> 28:36.534
This is the biggest break
we've ever had, Diana.

28:36.618 --> 28:38.161
We nail him planting that bomb...

28:38.244 --> 28:41.164
and it's the beginning of the end
for Mr. Fynch.

28:41.539 --> 28:43.500
What, you know where they intend
to plant it?

28:43.583 --> 28:44.918
Take a look at this.

28:45.960 --> 28:48.588
Ira's been theorizing
just how Fynch might go about...

28:48.671 --> 28:51.549
setting up a major surveillance operation
here in Washington.

28:51.674 --> 28:55.261
According to what we just heard,
this is the most likely possibility.

28:55.345 --> 28:57.430
Isn't that Fun Universe Amusement Park?

28:57.514 --> 28:59.265
It's the perfect cover for him.

28:59.349 --> 29:03.102
It's a legitimate enterprise,
constant crowds, lots of diversions.

29:03.186 --> 29:06.189
Perfect place for agents to rendezvous
and pass information.

29:06.272 --> 29:09.150
And since we already know that Fynch
is particularly fond...

29:09.234 --> 29:11.194
- of microwave phone conversations-
- Yes.

29:11.277 --> 29:14.447
That tower would be a perfect place
to set up monitoring equipment.

29:14.614 --> 29:17.033
- And that's the Crazy Wheel.
- Yeah.

29:17.116 --> 29:18.952
Which they apparently intend
to sabotage...

29:19.077 --> 29:21.829
in order to encourage the park owners
to sell out.

29:49.565 --> 29:53.361
You've checked all the rest rooms,
all the concession booths?

29:53.527 --> 29:55.154
Okay, here's what I want.

29:55.237 --> 29:58.407
I want you to post three guards
at every exit until closing time.

29:58.491 --> 30:01.369
If he isn't found then,
I want you to organize a dragnet.

30:01.452 --> 30:03.788
Are you certain that
that boy didn't leave the park...

30:03.871 --> 30:04.997
and hitchhike home?

30:05.081 --> 30:09.001
No. Randy would never have left
until the absolutely last minute.

30:09.085 --> 30:11.253
He was fascinated by the rides here.

30:11.337 --> 30:15.049
The roller coasters in particular,
and especially that one.

30:16.842 --> 30:20.804
All right. I'll double-check security
around the roller coaster grounds.

30:21.680 --> 30:25.226
No offense, Mr. Gurney, but I think
it's time the police were notified.

30:25.309 --> 30:27.561
There's no need for that.
My people will find him.

30:27.853 --> 30:30.189
Your people were trained
to run an amusement park...

30:30.272 --> 30:31.649
not to find lost children.

30:31.732 --> 30:32.858
May I?

31:11.396 --> 31:12.773
Who's there?

31:16.860 --> 31:18.195
Who is it?

31:59.069 --> 32:00.111
...in a tool case.

32:00.195 --> 32:02.989
He's going in as a member
of the cleanup crew. I'm following.

32:03.072 --> 32:05.617
Wait a minute.
You sure you don't need some help?

32:05.784 --> 32:08.036
If you lose him,
we'll have to tell the park not to open.

32:08.119 --> 32:09.662
Then Fynch'll know we're on to him.

32:10.038 --> 32:12.665
I have no intention of losing him, Steve.

35:18.933 --> 35:20.018
Wait!

37:47.581 --> 37:50.375
Please, don't be frightened.

37:51.585 --> 37:53.211
It's all right.

37:58.216 --> 38:00.802
You're gonna help me get out of here?

38:01.886 --> 38:03.805
I can't let you leave.

38:05.140 --> 38:06.933
What are you going to do with me?

38:08.643 --> 38:10.103
I don't know.

38:28.830 --> 38:31.291
We had a team out looking for him
all last night.

38:31.624 --> 38:34.919
And no, the boy is definitely
not in the park.

38:36.504 --> 38:39.382
Nothing like this
has ever happened before.

38:39.966 --> 38:42.593
Look, didn't I already answer
that question?

38:42.719 --> 38:43.928
What do you want?

38:44.011 --> 38:46.264
There's a Diana Prince out here to see you.

38:46.347 --> 38:49.684
I never heard ofher. Give her
an appointment two years from today.

38:49.767 --> 38:51.102
Mr. Gurney.

38:51.727 --> 38:52.854
Kidnapping? Listen...

38:52.937 --> 38:56.524
you use that word on your newscast,
you got yourself a libel suit, buddy!

40:37.707 --> 40:39.668
Did you ever ride the Super Loop?

40:42.003 --> 40:43.713
If so, in a way...

40:44.172 --> 40:45.590
I was there.

40:48.385 --> 40:50.387
See, I designed this ride.

40:52.097 --> 40:54.683
I know it better than anybody up top.

40:56.268 --> 40:58.895
I know where it's likely to weaken...

40:59.187 --> 41:00.397
they don't.

41:02.440 --> 41:05.402
So I keep tabs on it from down here.

41:07.195 --> 41:10.448
I try to let them know
where they should make repairs.

41:20.625 --> 41:22.210
My name's Dave.

41:25.338 --> 41:27.131
It's not contagious.

41:35.390 --> 41:36.808
What happened to you?

41:37.725 --> 41:38.977
Vietnam.

41:43.189 --> 41:46.150
I was flying in a chopper
filled with napalm.

41:53.658 --> 41:56.828
I let everyone think
the explosion had killed me.

42:17.348 --> 42:19.183
You see, my brother...

42:19.266 --> 42:21.686
owns the amusement park upstairs.

42:21.769 --> 42:25.481
Having a face like mine around
isn't too good for business.

42:26.399 --> 42:29.193
Unless you want to charge a buck a stare.

42:38.035 --> 42:39.370
Besides...

42:43.040 --> 42:45.501
he's got enough problems as it is.

42:56.220 --> 42:57.638
What's that?

43:00.391 --> 43:02.393
That's some kind of bomb.

43:06.397 --> 43:07.564
Trevor.

43:07.689 --> 43:08.899
Hi.

43:09.066 --> 43:10.734
Diana! How'd it go?

43:11.443 --> 43:14.404
I've got some good news
and some bad news.

43:14.488 --> 43:15.656
Preference as to order?

43:15.739 --> 43:17.324
Yeah, give me the good news first.

43:17.449 --> 43:21.203
Okay, Fynch's man was not able
to plant that bomb in the park.

43:21.620 --> 43:22.871
You recovered it?

43:24.581 --> 43:25.874
You sitting down yet?

43:26.708 --> 43:28.585
Where is it? Still in the park?

43:30.003 --> 43:31.213
I think so.

43:31.380 --> 43:33.006
What do you mean, you think so?

43:33.090 --> 43:34.841
It's a long story, Steve.

43:34.967 --> 43:37.678
Listen, I'm going to grab
a late breakfast and head on in.

43:37.761 --> 43:38.929
Any developments?

43:39.012 --> 43:42.224
You didn't happen to see a missing
teenager in the park, did you?

43:42.307 --> 43:44.142
No, I sure didn't.

43:45.644 --> 43:46.770
Okay.

43:46.853 --> 43:48.522
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

43:48.772 --> 43:51.942
Yeah, that's real good.
Run off about 200 of these.

43:52.025 --> 43:53.902
- Post them around the park.
- Will do.

43:53.985 --> 43:56.279
By the way, you got a call earlier
from Mr. Fynch.

43:56.363 --> 43:57.405
Who's that?

43:57.489 --> 44:00.283
He said he was here yesterday.
He gave me his phone number...

44:00.367 --> 44:03.119
- wanted to make sure you had it.
- Probably about insurance.

44:03.203 --> 44:07.415
Please, make this phone stop ringing.
I got nothing to say to anybody.

44:09.793 --> 44:12.796
I'm afraid that's not quite true,
Mr. Gurney.

44:13.380 --> 44:15.131
How could it not be true, Sergeant?

44:15.215 --> 44:17.801
We spent three hours
talking with each other last night.

44:17.884 --> 44:21.262
That was before I did some talking
to some of your employees.

44:22.639 --> 44:26.101
Now, what is this they tell me
about a monster in the park?

44:26.476 --> 44:27.811
Money is no object...

44:27.894 --> 44:31.689
as long as you can assure me
the job will be done immediately.

44:33.149 --> 44:35.401
I realize she's an IADC agent.

44:37.362 --> 44:39.197
I realize that, too.

44:42.700 --> 44:45.662
Why do you suppose
no one has ever succeeded?

44:46.829 --> 44:48.206
No.

44:49.415 --> 44:53.836
It's because no one has ever said,
"Get Diana Prince, whatever the cost. "

44:55.880 --> 44:58.174
I'm saying it to you, am I not?

45:00.051 --> 45:02.970
She's been interfering with my affairs,
and I want her dead...

45:03.054 --> 45:04.889
by the end of the day.

45:06.557 --> 45:08.226
Whatever it takes.

45:09.727 --> 45:10.978
Fine.

45:11.896 --> 45:13.481
I'll be waiting.

48:14.118 --> 48:15.620
