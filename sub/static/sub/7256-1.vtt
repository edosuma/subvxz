05:51.070 --> 05:52.840
Don't make tea like this, Dad.

05:52.840 --> 05:53.540
How?

05:53.610 --> 05:54.850
I don't like it like this.

05:54.910 --> 05:56.110
It's okay, try it.

06:56.900 --> 06:57.880
Khushal!

06:58.470 --> 07:00.880
You are somebody's son!

09:38.000 --> 09:40.380
I don't know where the voice is coming from.

16:54.400 --> 16:57.470
Any objections will leave your mind.

16:58.270 --> 17:01.050
And any questions will be answered, too.

17:19.490 --> 17:21.700
May God end your sadness and stress.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.810
May God give honor and respect,

17:25.160 --> 17:27.140
even to your children.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.600
Mom, are you happy?

18:00.800 --> 18:02.440
I like it here,

18:03.040 --> 18:05.210
but it's not like home.

18:07.270 --> 18:09.840
I miss Swat a lot.

18:11.840 --> 18:15.920
One day, I was standing by the
window looking at the moon,

18:17.280 --> 18:19.460
and I cried a lot.

18:20.290 --> 18:23.670
I told the moon, you're the
only thing that is the same,

18:24.960 --> 18:26.940
but everything else here is different.

20:41.660 --> 20:44.040
This school starts from grade nine.

20:46.100 --> 20:47.470
Up to grade 12,

20:47.470 --> 20:50.970
but, because we are still new, we only
have grade 9 and 10.

21:14.560 --> 21:17.340
The crops that you are growing?

21:32.980 --> 21:33.980
The largest mountain?

21:36.480 --> 21:38.290
The longest river?

21:43.420 --> 21:45.490
I'd like to become a lawyer.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.610
Remember the symbols and numbers.

25:19.810 --> 25:22.470
So you mean these signs
in the middle here?

25:22.470 --> 25:24.080
And then remember the number, too.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.960
You have to take it out, okay?

26:29.070 --> 26:33.640
No other religion gives more rights to
women. The Surah An-Nisaa ...

26:33.650 --> 26:35.960
... is completely dedicated to women.

26:36.180 --> 26:40.600
A mother has her rights, a sister has her
rights, a daughter has her rights.

27:03.440 --> 27:07.210
At first, he would say good things on the radio.

27:07.210 --> 27:09.210
There would be Islam in our country,

27:09.310 --> 27:11.660
and everything would be done
according to the Qur'an.

27:12.320 --> 27:14.490
We were pretty happy about that.

27:15.390 --> 27:17.460
The book of God Almighty

27:18.160 --> 27:20.600
is unlike any other book.

27:31.240 --> 27:36.380
Dear sisters, don't be fooled by superstitions.

28:22.450 --> 28:23.850
Is my hair covered?

28:23.860 --> 28:24.890
Yes, it's covered.

29:06.770 --> 29:08.770
So, which way is the house?

29:08.770 --> 29:11.940
I don't know. All the houses
are the same over here.

30:49.600 --> 30:53.170
I'm telling you it's different here.

30:53.170 --> 30:56.550
Here I'm not smart at all.

34:29.219 --> 34:33.690
We have directed the music
and video stores

34:33.690 --> 34:38.230
not to sell vulgar
photos, music, and CDs.

35:04.460 --> 35:09.060
We are not against advancement,
we are against shamelessness and vulgarity.

37:48.420 --> 37:50.960
Islam has given us the right to
defend ourselves.

37:51.220 --> 37:56.140
Any police or soldier that attacks
Muslims are infidels!

38:09.240 --> 38:12.150
I am a seeker of knowledge searching
for the right path.

38:12.910 --> 38:17.550
As a Muslim, it's my duty to ...

38:17.980 --> 38:22.930
spread what I have learned to the public,
in the name of God.

39:25.580 --> 39:30.580
My daughter's name is Aisha,
she is seventeen years old.

39:31.520 --> 39:35.730
I'm not going to say my daughter's name
because whenever I do

39:35.730 --> 39:38.970
I have a lot of emotion and break down.

41:13.590 --> 41:14.630
Zafar Al-Mulk

41:15.160 --> 41:16.100
Ahmad Sher Khan

41:16.890 --> 41:18.930
Paidur Khan and his sons,

41:19.100 --> 41:20.670
Abdul Qahar Khan

41:28.970 --> 41:30.010
Bakht Jamal ...

41:30.440 --> 41:31.890
Miagul Jan Pacha

41:32.180 --> 41:33.850
Dr. Haider Ali

41:53.630 --> 41:59.310
Malala Yousafzai targeted Islam.

42:01.810 --> 42:05.220
So, we tried to kill her.

50:09.790 --> 50:11.240
Islam is our religion.

50:11.830 --> 50:14.070
Islam is our religion.

50:14.700 --> 50:18.480
They tarnished the beautiful face of Islam.

50:18.840 --> 50:22.770
Today, in a very peaceful manner,

50:22.770 --> 50:25.380
we record our protest.

50:28.880 --> 50:33.290
People used to respect each other's beliefs.

50:33.580 --> 50:35.830
Whoever ruins Islam's holy name,

50:35.990 --> 50:38.050
for the sake of politics,

50:38.060 --> 50:40.720
it is required we stand in their way,

50:40.720 --> 50:42.930
and not let them go.

53:03.330 --> 53:05.300
Bring the breakfast.

53:05.300 --> 53:08.250
Dad, we are getting late for school.

54:56.580 --> 54:58.650
Destroying a school is not a difficult job.

54:58.920 --> 55:00.490
It's quite easy to torch.

55:01.720 --> 55:04.130
And God's full support is there.

55:13.800 --> 55:18.210
As long as girls are covered, they can
get religious education.

55:18.770 --> 55:22.480
Any other type of education is completely
unnecessary for women.

55:50.630 --> 55:52.550
Peace be upon you.

55:52.800 --> 55:54.340
Peace be upon you, as well.

55:54.470 --> 55:55.710
Peace be upon you.

55:55.710 --> 55:57.210
Peace be upon you, as well.

56:01.180 --> 56:03.980
I am very happy that you go to school and study.

56:03.980 --> 56:07.350
Put a lot of effort in your studies, okay?

56:07.350 --> 56:10.990
And when the teacher gives you homework,
make sure you do it on time, okay?

56:10.990 --> 56:12.230
Yes.

57:21.190 --> 57:24.640
There will be no end to this, God willing.

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:57.200
She should have stayed in Swat.
She went to England.

01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:11.020
Her father wrote everything for her.
That's why she's so famous.

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.410
After January 15th,

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:39.000
from the oldest to the youngest ...

01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:42.880
... not one single girl should go to school.

01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:44.930
Peace be upon you.

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:45.030
Even if I have nowhere to sit,

01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:48.160
and have to sit on the floor
to get an education,

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:53.030
I will do that.

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.100
You are not afraid of anyone?

01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:55.510
I am afraid of no one.

01:10:56.370 --> 01:10:58.180
Don't dare go forward.

01:10:58.510 --> 01:10:59.880
If you do, remember that you,

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:03.690
and your home, will not be safe!

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.530
The same Fazlullah, who
slaughtered our brothers

01:11:20.530 --> 01:11:23.770
and beat our girls with clubs,
why do you let him be?

01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:28.710
Why are Sufi Muhammad, Muslim Khan
and Fazlullah still free?

01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:42.500
Remember, I know you!

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.360
Listen carefully,

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:54.230
when I am willing to kill myself,
others are nothing to me.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.900
This is not just for Malala Yousafzai,

01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:00.940
but it is in the name of those girls
who fight for their rights,

01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:05.980
raise their voice for their rights and
have the passion to get educated.
