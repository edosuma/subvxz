MAN: <i>Mr. Speaker,
the President of the United States!</i>

00:23.600 --> 00:24.761
(CROWD CHEERING)

00:25.920 --> 00:27.251
SELINA: Thank you!

00:27.320 --> 00:28.685
We're making history.

00:28.760 --> 00:31.047
We're the first woman president, right?

00:31.120 --> 00:32.723
Well, I am. You're not, Michael.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.929
l am. Ow, you're hurting my hand. Hi.

00:36.480 --> 00:38.847
Oh, I see you.

00:38.920 --> 00:40.968
Thank you. Well, I'm getting jiggy with it.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.361
I'm gonna get that
Philip Roth book back to you.

00:43.480 --> 00:44.766
I haven't forgotten about it.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.922
God, I can't even hear myself.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.844
Am I talking? It's hard for me to hear me.

00:49.920 --> 00:50.921
(LAUGHS)

00:51.720 --> 00:53.563
<i>Thank you, Mr. Speaker,</i>

00:53.640 --> 00:55.449
<i>Mr. Vice President,</i>

00:55.520 --> 00:58.364
<i>members of Congress,</i>

00:58.440 --> 01:00.727
<i>my fellow Americans.</i>

01:00.800 --> 01:02.848
<i>I'd like to begin today...</i>

01:07.720 --> 01:09.324
<i>By saying a few words.</i>

01:16.040 --> 01:18.247
DAN: You know, some content
would be nice in this speech.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.687
This is just noise-shaped air.

01:20.800 --> 01:24.486
I know, and she's reading it tomorrow,
out loud in front of an audience.

01:24.560 --> 01:25.561
(MACHINE HUMS)

01:25.840 --> 01:27.922
- Hi, boss.
- DAN: Are you still juicing?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.923
- Yeah.
- Mike trying to be healthy.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.604
It's like a potato trying to whistle.

01:31.680 --> 01:35.048
Wendy and I made a deal.
If I make it to 50, I can quit fruit for good.

01:35.120 --> 01:36.690
What did you think
of the draft from last night?

01:36.760 --> 01:38.285
POTUS says the speech is too vague.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.044
- I thought she wanted it vague.
- Hey there.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.924
I guess we did too good a job.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.446
So, we still don't know what's going
in her speech to the joint session.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.204
I mean, what do we do?
Google it like a best man speech?

01:46.280 --> 01:47.691
Relax, it'll come together.

01:47.760 --> 01:50.161
It always has with every president
I've been comm director for.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.050
- How many is that?
- This would be my second.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.806
And actually, it didn't always come together
with President Hughes.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.121
We had many failures.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.167
I guess I just got used to it.

01:59.240 --> 02:00.366
Great pep talk, man.

02:00.440 --> 02:01.441
(LAUGHS)

02:03.080 --> 02:05.606
<i>SUE: Ma'am, Ben is getting Amy's
direct mail plans for you to approve,</i>

02:05.680 --> 02:07.728
then you meet the attorney general re Chicago

02:07.800 --> 02:10.041
after you swear in Ann James as housing sec.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.121
Yep.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.804
You have five priority calls
in a holding pattern,

02:12.880 --> 02:15.406
which can happen between
Moldova and skin cancer.

02:15.480 --> 02:16.481
Okay.

02:16.560 --> 02:18.130
And then you have
a potential 15-minute break.

02:18.240 --> 02:21.562
All right, during which I can sleep and you
can squeeze nutrient paste into my mouth.

02:21.680 --> 02:22.761
Uh, don't count on it, ma'am.

02:22.840 --> 02:26.049
US warship on exercises
just collided with a Greek fishing boat.

02:26.120 --> 02:27.724
- Two fatalities, ma'am.
- Oh.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.491
Yeah, we're looking at a big, fat Greek funeral.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.005
I'll arrange for you
to make a statement, ma'am.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.650
Yeah, 'cause I'm the President, see?

02:33.720 --> 02:35.085
Everything's my fault now.

02:35.920 --> 02:38.002
Hey, do I have time
to talk to Jim and Dan and Mike?

02:38.080 --> 02:40.003
- Uh, no, you don't.
- I want to.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.844
- Then you can.
- Right.

02:42.080 --> 02:45.323
The opening's good. The stuff about
Hughes and FLOTUS, section A.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.721
There isn't an A.
We're numbering the sections.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.848
- We are?
- We are. We agreed on numbers.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.684
So section A is now section one.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.410
Harvard education right there.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.969
Hey, who is that?

02:56.160 --> 02:59.004
Oh, I want to say Chloe or Ellie.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.366
DAN: Ally. No, Sally.

03:00.440 --> 03:03.808
There are a million young women around here
and they all look exactly the same to me.

03:03.880 --> 03:05.689
- You big lady racist.
-(LAUGHS)

03:05.760 --> 03:08.286
Hey, guys, I had an idea.

03:09.720 --> 03:10.846
Smells like Puerto Rico in here.

03:10.960 --> 03:12.041
I'm juicing.

03:13.440 --> 03:17.047
Oh, okay. So how about this idea?

03:17.120 --> 03:20.920
How about if we take the cut section
of the President Hughes draft

03:21.000 --> 03:25.210
and we put it together with the spendy
section of my Families First draft, right?

03:25.320 --> 03:26.731
Plus with the breast-feeding business.

03:26.800 --> 03:31.362
Yes, ma'am.
That's files Mike11A1 and Mike11A11.

03:31.480 --> 03:32.766
- That's for my reference.
- Okay.

03:32.840 --> 03:36.003
Ma'am, they still haven't found
the three missing hikers.

03:36.080 --> 03:39.163
- Cathy will keep you updated.
- Oh, thank you.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.567
- Who is that?
- Hey, who is Cathy?

03:45.480 --> 03:47.448
I've got to go. All right, come on.

03:47.920 --> 03:50.082
That was the actual
President of the United States.

03:50.160 --> 03:51.286
It never stops being cool.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.328
- She calls me Mike.
- That is your name.

03:53.440 --> 03:56.922
Obviously we're gonna need
to talk about President Hughes.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.402
You know, "Thanks a million, take it easy."
Let's just keep it short, though.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.244
And then that's where we put in

04:02.320 --> 04:04.721
-my vision for the future, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

04:04.800 --> 04:07.280
For now, just put a marker
that just says "future whatever."

04:07.360 --> 04:10.250
It's just that I've got an intelligence briefing
that I've got to get to, okay?

04:10.320 --> 04:12.322
Okay, you know
what we should do is prioritize.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.641
-'Cause there's like the cutty and the spendy...
- I agree.

04:14.920 --> 04:15.921
- Oh.
-(LAUGHS)

04:16.760 --> 04:18.841
Suckers.
(LAUGHS)

04:20.000 --> 04:22.685
Hey, ma'am, I can't go
in this intelligence briefing with you.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.410
- Right.
-ls there anything that you need?

04:24.480 --> 04:26.164
I got those Dutch eye-drops you requested.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.163
No, I don't need you, Gary.

04:28.240 --> 04:30.527
Great. Great. I just thought I'd ask.
Here's your coffee.

04:30.600 --> 04:31.647
- No.
- Okay.

04:32.520 --> 04:33.965
Yeah, um, ma'am,

04:34.040 --> 04:38.045
have you given any thought to
the Vice President being at these meetings?

04:38.160 --> 04:40.083
Oh, wow.

04:40.160 --> 04:44.802
You know, I mean, I wouldnâ€™t want him to
have the shitty experience that I had as Veep.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.006
No.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.845
Unfortunately, the precedent
has been set for this meeting,

04:48.920 --> 04:50.729
so I wouldn't want to go change things...

04:50.800 --> 04:52.325
- Not at this early stage.
- Exactly. Right.

04:57.720 --> 04:59.131
President needs the bag.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.247
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

05:00.360 --> 05:01.566
She only needs the bag.

05:01.720 --> 05:04.849
Okay, it's not that simple. Hey, hey, hey, easy.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.410
You're holding it wrong.
You're holding it wrong.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.481
(DOOR CLOSES)

05:08.880 --> 05:13.329
Ladies be crying, pimps be dying.
It's Jonah Ryan.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.482
Ah, I thought I heard a little girl's voice.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.324
- I was right.
- Hello, sir.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.289
Come with me.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.850
This is a man hang now.

05:20.920 --> 05:24.288
It doesn't reek of moisturizer
and vaginal spray anymore.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.601
- And that was just Dan.
-(LAUGHTER)

05:27.440 --> 05:28.805
He)', big guy. How's it hanging?

05:28.880 --> 05:31.611
You know, pretty good.
Like a strap-on in a porn dungeon.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.524
Rock hard and covered in pussyjuice.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.601
(LAUGHS)

05:34.880 --> 05:36.644
You like that? I got a ton of 'em.
You can ask me again.

05:36.720 --> 05:37.846
Hey, how's it hanging?

05:37.920 --> 05:40.287
- Uh, like a fat meat fence post...
- DOYLE: Mr. Ryan.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.721
Oh, Mr. Vice President. Hello.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.165
Uh, oh, thank you for asking me to stop by.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.406
You know who won the war?

05:47.040 --> 05:48.565
I believe that we... We did?

05:48.640 --> 05:51.450
No, not the grunts in the front.

05:51.520 --> 05:54.364
It was the fellas behind the scenes.

05:54.440 --> 05:57.762
- The intel gatherers, the code crackers.
- Ah, yeah.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.480
I need you to be my West Wing wiretap.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.725
I need you to spy for me.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.410
Yes, sir.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.448
Selina freezing you out, old-timer?

06:06.520 --> 06:09.205
Oh, absolutely. Cycle of abuse continues.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.645
Like the Catholic Church.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.122
Yeah, or an Arkansas wedding.

06:13.280 --> 06:14.805
Oh, boom. Lean down, high five.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.803
- All right.
- Yeah. (LAUGHS)

06:18.000 --> 06:19.525
DOYLE: That's it, Jonah. Thank you.

06:19.600 --> 06:20.965
Uh, yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.165
Yeah, he's a good kid.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.524
Yeah, excuse me a second.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.371
So, you hate me, right?

06:30.480 --> 06:32.289
-I'm sorry?
- No, no, I'm kidding. We're buds.

06:32.360 --> 06:34.681
But I'm the Vice President's Chief of Staff.

06:34.760 --> 06:38.048
You know, you came to see him directly,
I didn't know you were coming.

06:38.120 --> 06:41.363
- So...
- Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to not...

06:41.440 --> 06:43.044
I didn't mean to step out of line.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.849
Oh, no, we're good. We're friends forever.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.122
- All right, okay, cool. Thanks, Teddy.
- You're a good man, Jonah.

06:47.200 --> 06:51.444
We need guys like you
because this game takes guts.

06:51.520 --> 06:55.047
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right? And it takes balls. Whoa.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.531
You've got 'em, buddy.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.160
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

07:03.360 --> 07:04.600
Yeah, elevator's here.

07:04.680 --> 07:07.445
Yeah. The Vice President likes you.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.851
I like when he likes people.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.647
So just text me before you come over.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.643
I'll always let you in.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.880
- Okay.
-lt was great talking to you.

07:21.800 --> 07:24.280
I don't want to be stuck with the Hughes plan.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.885
Some dead guy's plan.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.121
Well, he's not dead, ma'am.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.486
No. It's fun for me to say, though.

07:28.560 --> 07:32.610
What are the numbers here
in the latest polling on Families First, huh?

07:32.720 --> 07:34.324
Raising kids out of poverty
and helping working moms?

07:34.400 --> 07:35.447
Yeah.

07:35.520 --> 07:36.806
Poor working moms
seem to love it for some reason.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.644
But they only ever vote with their phones,

07:38.720 --> 07:41.530
usually for other
poor young moms who can't sing.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.807
All right, well, thank you
for these numbers, guys.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.530
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, Madam President.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.922
But, I mean, there has got to be a way
to have the cuts

07:49.000 --> 07:50.968
and have the Families First bill.

07:51.040 --> 07:53.327
What about the military?
Would they go for more cuts, you think?

07:53.400 --> 07:55.880
Yeah, we just got to do a cock-thumb.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.485
What? What did you say? A cock-thumb?

07:57.560 --> 07:58.527
- Yeah.
- What is that?

07:58.600 --> 08:00.523
Tell me, do not show me.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.683
Well, we propose a radical cut to the military,
cutting off the cock,

08:03.760 --> 08:06.650
the Joint Chiefs in turn propose
their own more reasonable cut,

08:06.720 --> 08:07.687
cutting off the thumb.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.364
Commonly known as negotiating?

08:10.920 --> 08:13.002
Okay, well, let's cock-thumb.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.162
I really don't care for that term.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.765
- Madam President.
- Yeah?

08:16.840 --> 08:19.127
The prime minister of India has sent you this.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.326
Why?

08:20.400 --> 08:23.529
I can't really work it out,
but I'll put in a time for you to thank him.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.204
No, I don't want that.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.805
- No duck?
- No.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.803
It's a dead duck.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.081
(EXHALES)

08:30.440 --> 08:34.650
Madam President, there will be a way to do
both of these things, cuts and spending.

08:34.799 --> 08:38.043
I know, you can absolutely do
two contradictory things at once.

08:38.600 --> 08:42.400
For example, I love my mother,
but I had to put her in a home.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.721
And it's actually better for her if I don't visit.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.882
Ma'am, this job will never be easy.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.689
Man, don't I know it. Oh, my God.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.285
I feel like I've got a hamster wheel in my head.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.686
- You know that feeling?
- Yeah.

08:51.800 --> 08:52.767
Did you ever hear the theory

08:52.840 --> 08:55.491
that Reagan hired Hinckley
just so he could get two weeks in bed?

08:55.560 --> 08:57.369
(LAUGHS) Yeah, I'd buy that.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.761
All right, so we'll cock-thumb
the Joint Chiefs.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.205
What do you think they're gonna offer?

09:01.360 --> 09:02.930
I don't know. Two, three billion.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.729
You know, maybe sell off a useless airfield.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.962
- Maybe we can put Afghanistan on eBay.
-(LAUGHS)

09:07.480 --> 09:09.005
- Get about 10 bucks for that.
- Yeah. Yeah.

09:09.800 --> 09:13.646
Louis, Pennsylvania numbers, I need them
up to date and two days ago, so work it out.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.041
I have the new figures on absentee ballots
and early voting.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.487
Great, take a chopper up
and add it to the top of the pile on my desk.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.807
Mr. Cafferty wants to know
our direct mail plans.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.530
The President needs to make a decision.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.250
Cuts or spending on the Families bill.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.209
- Got it.
- Chicken and egg scenario.

09:26.280 --> 09:29.409
Yeah, but where the chicken
is just refusing to ovulate.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.084
What's in the speech?

09:31.160 --> 09:33.686
Will the President cut the deficit
or spend on families?

09:33.800 --> 09:35.484
Austerity or playgrounds?

09:35.840 --> 09:37.524
<i>MIKE: She's considering her options.</i>

09:38.560 --> 09:39.721
Or she doesn't have a clue.

09:39.880 --> 09:43.726
We cannot afford to fall behind.
We're neck and neck with Chung.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.327
<i>And have you heard the Thornhill rumor?</i>

09:46.400 --> 09:50.041
Of course I have, Amy.
I'm the White House Press Secretary.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.963
But imagine I haven't.

09:52.360 --> 09:53.725
He might quit.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.962
Stop running against
Selina for the nomination.

09:56.080 --> 09:58.686
And my assistant tells me via cue card

09:59.080 --> 10:01.128
that Ericsson wants a meeting.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.406
<i>MIKE: Thornhill quitting is good.</i>

10:02.760 --> 10:05.161
No, wait, you're... No, no, it's good.

10:05.240 --> 10:09.404
No. If he folds, Chung gets his votes.
Candidate poker.

10:09.480 --> 10:10.970
Well, don't blame me for this, Amy.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.530
Don't shoot the messenger.

10:12.600 --> 10:15.683
I just gave you the message.
You're being shot by the messenger.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.048
<i>MIKE: Well, it's still not good.</i>

10:20.720 --> 10:24.281
There's still no content in this speech.
It's like a diet souffle.

10:24.360 --> 10:25.930
I know, I know. Sue, does the President

10:26.000 --> 10:28.890
have any spare time this afternoon
for an extra speechwriting meeting?

10:28.960 --> 10:30.485
Can mice levitate, Mike?

10:30.560 --> 10:32.961
Can they levitate
and fire lasers out of their mouse eyes?

10:33.040 --> 10:34.610
No.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.967
Well, then we've just asked each other
equally ridiculous questions.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.486
Hey, this bag was not returned to me
in the condition I expected.

10:39.560 --> 10:41.403
There was a lot of loose lids. Do you know...

10:43.400 --> 10:45.562
- A lot of changes, huh, buddy?
- Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

10:46.560 --> 10:47.721
All right, so look, in terms of actual words...

10:47.800 --> 10:49.962
I mean, most meetings
I don't even have security clearance for.

10:50.040 --> 10:53.442
Navy stewards bring her drinks in.
I barely see her. (CHUCKLES)

10:53.520 --> 10:55.363
You can just use the FLOTUS window.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.328
Looks right down onto the Oval Office.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.131
- You can?
- Sure. A lot of anxious First Ladies use it.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.851
Okay, that's ignored,
but thank you for your concern.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.924
Mike, you can barely cope.
How are you finding the new setup?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.650
I'm actually kind of famous now.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.290
Really? You sure about that?

11:10.360 --> 11:13.170
Yeah, I got recognized on the street today.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.242
Guy had already met me
and then forgot that he met me

11:15.360 --> 11:19.001
and then recognized me from TV
and then remembered me again.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.242
That's a great story, Mike.

11:21.320 --> 11:25.291
Oh, hey, if any of you new bitch puppies need
help finding the mommy teats around here,

11:25.360 --> 11:27.681
you can just ask a West Wing vet, 'Kay?

11:27.760 --> 11:29.444
Oh, how's the new Veep's office?

11:29.920 --> 11:31.968
- What?
- The new Veep's office.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.811
It's great.

11:34.320 --> 11:37.529
Why are you even asking?
I mean, it's so good. It's fucking... It's great.

11:37.600 --> 11:41.525
Me, Doyle. I mean, come on, Teddy.
Of course, Teddy.

11:42.880 --> 11:45.281
So good over there, guys. So good.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.442
RICHARD: It's my pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Ericsson.

11:48.560 --> 11:49.561
BILL: Good.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.201
It's a nice room.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.290
For a lonely suicide
or an affair with your secretary.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.641
It's discreet. There's no DC people here.

11:58.720 --> 12:01.246
I booked it using the name Laszlo Whittaker.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.926
Was Vladimir Draw-Attention-To-Myself
already taken?

12:04.880 --> 12:06.006
A coffee?

12:06.120 --> 12:08.521
- Skinny latte.
- Americano triple shot.

12:08.600 --> 12:11.251
How about any sides? Maybe a sandwich?

12:11.320 --> 12:13.402
I'll take a protein bar.
I'm allergic to macadamia nuts.

12:13.480 --> 12:15.721
Got it, no deadly macadamias
for Mr. Ericsson.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.167
- Almond croissant, sparkling water.
-l'll take a water, too.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.730
You know what?
Just gonna grab a pen and paper.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.171
Let me write this down.

12:22.160 --> 12:24.527
Or I will remember it using my brain.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.045
I've got a pretty good one.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.690
Illinois Institute of Technology, so...

12:29.000 --> 12:30.081
I'll cut right to the chase.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.764
Good, 'cause that last minute
was a very long minute.

12:31.840 --> 12:34.047
- Is Joe...
- Joe Thornhill quitting?

12:34.120 --> 12:36.726
Nice question. I was just asking it.

12:36.800 --> 12:40.771
Joe's not quitting, but the rumor's half right.
I've just quit as his campaign manager.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.081
Why would you do that the fuck for?

12:43.160 --> 12:45.561
Joltin' Joe has hit the top of his bounce.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.961
Does he realize that
or is he gonna find out on ESPN?

12:48.040 --> 12:50.611
No, he's very, very stupid.

12:50.680 --> 12:53.206
I thought he'd be an interesting challenge,
but he's a boring chore.

12:54.360 --> 12:56.124
Your job is very interesting.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.884
- Well...
- Challenging.

12:57.960 --> 12:59.450
Very exciting job.

12:59.520 --> 13:04.526
My job, yes, it is.
The job I have is a very good job.

13:08.360 --> 13:10.806
- Gary.
- Hey, Sue, how's it going?

13:10.920 --> 13:12.445
- I was just in here.
- I get it, Gary.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.642
- You look pretty.
- You don't need to pretend.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.769
All I need to know is has the black binder
from her desk been moved?

13:17.840 --> 13:21.128
- The black binder? Yeah, yeah, yeah, it has.
- Okay.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.965
Do you know what?
I have never looked at her from this angle.

13:24.040 --> 13:27.283
And she still just radiates... Okay.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.129
Do you think Selina will win?

13:29.200 --> 13:31.202
Tough fight, but she can win.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.203
You said she can win. I asked if she will win.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.601
I'm sorry, was that sparkling or still water?

13:35.680 --> 13:38.490
And what kind of croissant?
I definitely remember the rest.

13:38.560 --> 13:43.407
Okay, I'm leaving this hotel room.
Good-bye, Amy. Good-bye, Laszlo.

13:44.640 --> 13:45.641
(DOOR CLOSES)

13:46.040 --> 13:48.520
He just quit
being Thornhill's campaign manager.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.120
Wonder what he'll do next.
He's the best campaign manager in America.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.248
- One of them.
- I mean, he could have any job he wants.

13:53.320 --> 13:54.765
- Yeah.
- He could have your job.

13:55.920 --> 13:58.366
You know, I'm saying all this out loud
and I probably shouldn't be.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.606
Thanks, ma'am.

13:59.680 --> 14:02.809
Would you like me to take away
the signed letters in the black binder?

14:02.880 --> 14:04.041
How'd you know I signed those?

14:04.120 --> 14:07.090
Oh, I have a sixth sense.
And a seventh for when I need it.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.884
- Gary.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.849
- Do you have my hand cream?
- Oh, yeah.

14:10.920 --> 14:13.002
- I got the new formula from La Prairie...
- No, no.

14:13.120 --> 14:16.044
Just give rne the whole tube 'cause
you can't come into this next meeting either.

14:16.120 --> 14:19.203
- And I'm totally fine with that, you know.
- Well...

14:19.280 --> 14:20.805
Well, Joint Chiefs are on their way.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.480
We should hear their
big clanking balls any second.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.927
And then all the paintings
will fall off the walls.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.241
- Oh, hey, Gare?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.527
What is the coffee
that the navy stewards use?

14:30.640 --> 14:32.165
(LAUGHS) I can only imagine.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.651
- It's heaven.
- Oh.

14:33.720 --> 14:36.405
- It's like Colombian tongue sex.
- Wow.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.006
Why don't we ever use that coffee?

14:38.080 --> 14:40.048
I don't know, but you love our old coffee.

14:40.120 --> 14:41.406
- Nah.
- No.

14:42.840 --> 14:46.049
- Reservoir Dogs, huh?
- Excuse me?

14:46.120 --> 14:47.281
I've never actually seen it,

14:47.360 --> 14:50.807
but as I understand, there's a scene
where they all walk in a row like this.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.769
What do you think they're gonna offer us?

14:52.880 --> 14:55.167
- Uh, $2 billion. Three, tops.
- Uh-huh.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.084
So you ready for these buzz-cut bozos?

14:57.160 --> 14:58.491
What are you talking about?

14:58.560 --> 15:02.485
I'm used to dealing with angry,
aggressive, dysfunctional men,

15:02.560 --> 15:04.403
i.e. men.

15:04.480 --> 15:07.529
Well, that's what we do best.
That and farting during first Communions.

15:07.600 --> 15:10.410
It's funny. I don't really think of you as a man.

15:10.600 --> 15:13.080
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, here they are.

15:13.160 --> 15:15.083
Ma'am. Joint Chiefs of Staff.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.810
- Gentlemen.
- DEXTER: Madam President.

15:16.880 --> 15:19.087
SELINA: Please come in. Take a seat.

15:19.160 --> 15:23.324
I understand you're on the Warpath.
I get that. I think it's your favorite path.

15:23.680 --> 15:24.841
(LAUGHS)

15:29.840 --> 15:31.763
- Vampires!
- God! Stop!

15:31.840 --> 15:34.047
(LAUGHS)
If I was a ninja, you'd be dead right now.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.811
That's a life lesson
courtesy of Jobi-Wan Kenobi.

15:36.880 --> 15:37.961
That's not cool, man.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.161
Wait, what are you even doing?

15:39.240 --> 15:41.402
I'm keeping an eye on the President.

15:42.680 --> 15:43.920
Are you sure you wouldn't
be more comfortable

15:44.000 --> 15:45.081
at the book depository next door?

15:45.160 --> 15:46.446
Do you know what?
Can you just leave, please?

15:46.520 --> 15:47.726
It was a joke.

15:47.840 --> 15:50.286
Hey, do you know Teddy Sykes
over in the VP's office?

15:50.360 --> 15:52.249
Teddy? Yeah. He's a great guy.

15:52.320 --> 15:54.926
- He is?
- He's really, really hands-on.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.001
Oh.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.761
Okay.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.683
Why do you want to know about Teddy?

15:59.760 --> 16:01.967
He played this joke,
and, I mean, it was really funny,

16:02.040 --> 16:05.249
but, I don't know, it was a little weird and...

16:05.360 --> 16:06.646
What's the President doing?

16:06.720 --> 16:08.449
It looks like she's having a meeting
with the Joint Chiefs.

16:08.560 --> 16:11.086
I don't think it's scheduled.

16:11.240 --> 16:12.401
We know you need cuts,

16:12.480 --> 16:16.405
but a further 25,000 reduction
in active military troops is unthinkable.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.970
Yeah, but here I am. I'm thinking it.

16:18.080 --> 16:21.163
The only unthinkable thing
is that anything is unthinkable.

16:21.240 --> 16:23.288
Kent majored in fortune cookies.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.569
-(GASPS)
'Oh! Oh! Oh, my God!

16:27.640 --> 16:30.086
Are you okay? You look... You look okay.

16:30.160 --> 16:35.849
Your predecessor said that a force of 420,000
would be more than adequate...

16:35.920 --> 16:38.446
Yeah, that's horse hockey.
Forgive me, ma'am.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.010
No, no. No forgiveness needed.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.809
I mean, at least you didn't say
that's fucking bullshit.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.206
(LAUGHS)

16:43.760 --> 16:45.683
Okay, well, let's see. We're stuck.

16:45.760 --> 16:48.127
We'd like to propose an alternative cut.

16:48.200 --> 16:52.171
Oh, okay. An alternative cut.
That sounds interesting, doesn't it, Ben?

16:52.280 --> 16:53.486
- Very interesting.
- Very interesting.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.449
The N620 submarine lacks a mission.

16:55.520 --> 16:58.285
It was designed
for an outdated Cold War scenario

16:58.360 --> 17:01.443
that's gone the way
of the fax machine and the VCR.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.887
Okay, so what does that mean
in terms of numbers, ballpark-wise?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.367
I mean, if we were to scrap
this program you suggest?

17:07.440 --> 17:08.601
$50 billion.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.211
I'm sorry, could you say that again?

17:12.280 --> 17:13.520
Fifty billion.

17:13.880 --> 17:17.566
Five-zero followed by a bunch of zeroes?

17:17.680 --> 17:18.840
Nine.

17:19.359 --> 17:20.361
Yes.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.124
All right, well, you know, I think...

17:22.200 --> 17:24.328
Well, you know,
this gives us something to think about.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.560
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:25.839 --> 17:27.490
It's page three, I think it is.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.688
Yeah. Well, I think we might have different...

17:29.760 --> 17:31.364
-(PANTING)
-(TEDDY LAUGHING)

17:31.800 --> 17:33.928
I think Lassie is trying to tell us something.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.571
POTUS and the Joint Chiefs meeting
happening now.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.483
Oh, shit! God damn it. I told you, Teddy.

17:38.560 --> 17:41.131
Sir, can I sit down?
I think I split my diaphragm.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.123
I need you to run.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.081
- Thank you.
- Okay.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.647
-(EXHALES)
-(LAUGHING)

17:53.160 --> 17:55.367
$50 billion!

17:55.440 --> 17:56.726
That was masterly, ma'am.

17:56.800 --> 17:57.847
SELINA: on, my God!

17:57.920 --> 17:59.922
Or mistressly, whichever isn't offensive.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.243
That wasn't a cock-thumb.
That was a cock-cock. (LAUGHS)

18:03.320 --> 18:04.401
(LAUGHS) Yeah, I nearly puked.

18:04.520 --> 18:05.931
How big is $50 billion?

18:06.000 --> 18:09.641
Get it in here in five-dollar bills.
I'm gonna climb it and see if I get frostbite.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.490
(LAUGHING)

18:12.520 --> 18:14.761
Oh, oh, Andrew.

18:14.840 --> 18:16.763
- Heard there was a meeting.
- SELINA: Yes.

18:16.840 --> 18:18.922
It was just a little light housecleaning.
Dusting, really.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.331
I ran all the way here.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.368
Well, you know what?
You're in phenomenal shape.

18:22.440 --> 18:24.602
For a man of your age, it's just extraordinary.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.284
Are you thirsty?
Do you want something to drink?

18:26.360 --> 18:29.523
(BREATHLESS) No, I have a lot to do.

18:29.840 --> 18:32.320
Okay, bye-bye. Oh, wait, Andrew.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.640
Would you close the door behind you?

18:34.160 --> 18:36.527
Thanks. But nice to see you.

18:39.840 --> 18:43.128
"We bet on American workers.
We bet on American ingenuity."

18:43.200 --> 18:46.363
Guys, this writing is absolutely fantastic!

18:46.440 --> 18:49.011
- It's Fifty Shades of Great.
-(LAUGHS)

18:49.720 --> 18:51.802
- SELINA: Really.
- Thank you, Madam President.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.008
All in a day's work that also took all night.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.127
SELINA: HOW do I look?

18:55.200 --> 18:56.281
- Oh, beautiful, beautiful.
- Good.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.522
Actually, let me take these glasses out.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.090
It looks like you have a penis.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.247
What?

19:01.320 --> 19:03.687
Which you can totally pull off if you had to.

19:03.760 --> 19:04.966
- BEN: Got to go.
- Good luck, Madam President.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.287
- Bye.
- AMY: Well done, guys.

19:07.360 --> 19:11.251
I don't like to swear, guys,
but I think the S is about to hit the F.

19:11.320 --> 19:12.560
The shit is gonna hit the fuck?

19:12.640 --> 19:16.167
No, "F" is for fan, Mike, not fuck.
Why would shit hit fuck? Shit doesn't hit fuck.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.210
Well, I've read the speech.
So have my friends here.

19:19.280 --> 19:22.090
Oh, sorry. Guys, this is
the military industrial complex.

19:22.160 --> 19:26.768
Military industrial complex,
these are the President's flying monkeys.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.001
Is this about the submarine jobs?

19:28.080 --> 19:30.287
Ten fucking points to Elsa the Ice Queen.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.846
Shall we recalibrate our language, Roger?

19:32.920 --> 19:35.446
It's Congressman Furlong to you, gray Elvis.

19:35.520 --> 19:39.809
And, yes, this is about specifically
1,900 submarine jobs in my district

19:39.880 --> 19:41.962
that this announcement will torpedo.

19:42.040 --> 19:46.841
The N620s are for a threat that doesn't exist.
We may as well have an anti-unicorn strategy.

19:46.920 --> 19:51.562
And they cost $50 billion. Fifty billion.
And I'm gonna say dollars again. Dollars.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.722
You think the whole sub
is made in one place?

19:53.800 --> 19:57.361
Because the fin, or whatever the fuck,
it comes from one factory in one state.

19:57.440 --> 20:00.569
And then this little round fucking window
comes from another place. All right?

20:00.640 --> 20:03.041
And the fuel rods
are from Cheesedick, Wisconsin.

20:03.120 --> 20:06.886
We are going to lose votes
and seats everywhere.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.327
So take the periscope out of your asses

20:09.400 --> 20:11.721
and look at the warhead of shit
that's coming at you.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.804
Hey, Dobby the House Elf, we've had enough.
Just get out.

20:14.880 --> 20:15.961
Okay.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.883
You can wave bye-bye
to the Families First bill

20:17.960 --> 20:21.760
because the lawmakers in these districts
are going to Vulcan death grip you to fuck.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.763
Live long and fuck off.

20:24.520 --> 20:26.124
Speech is already in the teleprompter.

20:26.200 --> 20:28.646
She's on her way down.
I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.

20:28.720 --> 20:31.121
Popped your cardiac cherry, huh, Mike?

20:31.200 --> 20:33.646
I'm gonna go talk to the President.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.402
- Hey, Mr. Speaker.
- Thrilled for you, ma'am.

20:37.480 --> 20:38.606
Oh, see, you're being sarcastic, Jim.

20:38.680 --> 20:40.205
Absolutely thrilled, really.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.567
- Oh, no, see, that's sarcasm.
- Couldn't be more thrilled.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.244
- That is sarcasm.
- No, it's not.

20:44.320 --> 20:45.446
- It is, I see it.
- No.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.363
- Yeah, and, oh...
- Ma'am.

20:47.440 --> 20:49.010
Hi, Ben.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.202
What's with that Deputy Dawg face
you got going?

20:51.280 --> 20:54.489
Well, there's a lot of districts
that won't support the submarine cuts.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.244
So if you go ahead, they're gonna kill...

20:56.320 --> 20:58.049
They're gonna kill my Families First bill?

20:58.120 --> 20:59.645
That's the long and shit of it.

20:59.720 --> 21:02.451
Okay. We're gonna have
to find the money somewhere else.

21:02.520 --> 21:05.285
Okay? Just end high school
in ninth grade or something.

21:05.360 --> 21:06.964
Just take the submarine cuts
out of the speech.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.371
Okay.

21:08.440 --> 21:09.601
- Change it. Hurry up.
- Yeah.

21:09.680 --> 21:14.208
Mr. Speaker,
the President of the United States.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.210
(CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

21:18.000 --> 21:19.411
- She's on stage.
-(CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

21:19.480 --> 21:21.881
Okay, okay, one of us
needs to write some new text

21:21.960 --> 21:23.928
and I really need to stop shallow breathing.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.809
POTUS has spoken. We cut the cuts.

21:25.880 --> 21:28.121
Okay, Sue, we need to go
to that section of the speech.

21:28.200 --> 21:31.443
I don't think I can edit that section and
still have Selina see the top of the speech.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.801
- Let me see what happens if I...
- That's what happens.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.928
We're the first woman president, right?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.809
Well, I am. You're not, Michael.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.609
- Congratulations, ma'am.
-l'm looking at you,

21:39.680 --> 21:41.444
but I'm shaking somebody else's hand.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.329
It's the strangest feeling.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.368
Oh, it's you. That is you, right?

21:45.440 --> 21:46.487
It's him.

21:46.720 --> 21:48.722
(LAUGHING)

21:49.440 --> 21:50.487
Hurry UP!

21:50.560 --> 21:53.166
How come you type with only two fingers?
You're not a sloth.

21:53.240 --> 21:56.642
No, wait, she's got the hard copy, right?
I mean, that's her backup chute right there.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.449
Great, she reads that while we edit this.

21:58.520 --> 21:59.646
Okay. Okay.

21:59.720 --> 22:02.007
GARY: I have her glasses.

22:02.080 --> 22:04.242
- What?
- I've got her glasses.

22:04.320 --> 22:05.606
You should not have those.

22:05.720 --> 22:07.563
Why have you blinded the president, Gary?

22:07.680 --> 22:09.125
They were ruining the line of her dress and...

22:09.200 --> 22:11.168
- Mr. Walsh.
- No one hates me more than I hate myself.

22:11.240 --> 22:14.210
You're wrong there. You run into the chamber
and you give her the glasses

22:14.280 --> 22:15.850
and you keep running until you hit the ocean.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.206
Go, Gary. Chamber, now.

22:17.280 --> 22:18.611
DAN: Too late, she's already at the podium.

22:18.680 --> 22:20.330
Well, I've killed her. I've killed her, okay?

22:20.440 --> 22:21.965
SELINA: Thank you, Mr. Speaker...

22:22.040 --> 22:24.361
<i>God, God, God.
-...Mr. Vice President,</i>

22:24.440 --> 22:27.523
<i>members of Congress, my fellow Americans.</i>

22:28.920 --> 22:30.649
<i>I'd like to begin today...</i>

22:37.440 --> 22:39.442
<i>By saying a few words.</i>

22:40.160 --> 22:41.161
<i>(CLEARS THROAT)</i>

22:42.160 --> 22:45.403
<i>I'd like to ask for some time to think</i>

22:46.360 --> 22:50.729
<i>about President Hughes
and the former First Lady.</i>

22:51.560 --> 22:55.326
<i>So, let's take a moment to bow our heads</i>

22:55.400 --> 22:58.688
<i>and remember their contribution
to this great nation.</i>

22:58.760 --> 23:00.364
They're not dead.

23:09.360 --> 23:10.361
(LAUGHS)

23:10.520 --> 23:12.648
I've done it! I rule so hard.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.404
Don't stop. Give me the USB.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.891
Oh, shit. I always get it wrong.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.167
It's a 50-50 chance.
I never get the right side up.

23:20.560 --> 23:24.531
<i>God bless them. What people, what people.</i>

23:24.600 --> 23:28.047
<i>There are literally no words.</i>

23:28.160 --> 23:30.731
Come on, come on. Hurry up.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.848
<i>People want to know who I am</i>

23:32.960 --> 23:37.329
<i>and I want to tell them so much.</i>

23:38.440 --> 23:40.522
SUE: It is up and the eagle has noticed.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.168
-(LAUGHS)
- Whoo! (LAUGHS)

23:43.320 --> 23:47.120
My entire career just flashed before my eyes.
It was incredibly impressive.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.931
<i>...that its government was in safe hands.</i>

23:50.000 --> 23:52.970
No, that's... That's the wrong phrase.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.610
- Huh? What?
- Hmm?

23:54.680 --> 23:58.924
I think I put the new stuff
in Mike11A1, not Mike11A1A.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.451
But that could be the other way around.

24:00.600 --> 24:04.400
This version still has placeholders in it, and
the next section just says "future whatever."

24:04.480 --> 24:07.609
<i>So today, I don't just want
to talk about the present.</i>

24:07.680 --> 24:09.682
<i>I want to talk about the future.</i>

24:12.360 --> 24:16.922
<i>Whatever we have in store</i>

24:19.040 --> 24:20.644
<i>cannot be known.</i>

24:21.120 --> 24:24.488
<i>But given time, it can be understood.</i>

24:25.600 --> 24:28.365
<i>The past was once the future.</i>

24:28.440 --> 24:33.526
<i>The future is, I should say, unknown.
It is in fact unknowable.</i>

24:33.600 --> 24:35.329
She's bebop speaking.

24:35.400 --> 24:39.291
<i>So I'm asking you to meet me at the station</i>

24:39.920 --> 24:46.485
<i>and join me as we board a train
bound for a place called the future.</i>

24:46.560 --> 24:49.166
I detest jazz, but this is impressive.

24:49.240 --> 24:53.450
<i>And we will be ready for that future whatever.</i>

24:53.800 --> 24:55.928
(CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

24:58.080 --> 25:01.004
I'm almost crying.
I didn't know I could still almost do that.

25:01.080 --> 25:02.241
<i>But now...</i>

25:02.320 --> 25:08.248
<i>But now it's time to roll past the future
to move on and do so very, very quickly.</i>

25:09.200 --> 25:12.044
<i>When we think of what is to come,
we think of our children.</i>

25:12.120 --> 25:14.202
MIKE: (LAUGHS) Superb! We're back on track.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.281
And the rest of the speech is okay?

25:15.360 --> 25:17.567
- Yes. Absolutely.
- Okay, thank you.

25:17.640 --> 25:18.846
Uh,uh,no.

25:18.920 --> 25:20.365
<i>SELINA: And when we think of our children...</i>

25:20.440 --> 25:24.365
I think this version still has
President Hughes' old spending plan in it.

25:24.440 --> 25:28.684
<i>...we will invest $60 billion</i>

25:28.760 --> 25:32.481
<i>in the new N620 submarine fleet.</i>

25:32.600 --> 25:34.568
-(GROANS)
- God damn it.

25:34.640 --> 25:38.850
<i>That's a further $10 billion investment</i>

25:39.960 --> 25:42.611
<i>in this vital and modern defense system.</i>

25:42.680 --> 25:43.920
(CHEERING)

25:47.480 --> 25:49.244
Well, she just announced a dead guy's plan.

25:49.360 --> 25:51.567
He's not fucking dead.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.005
Do you think she noticed?

25:53.080 --> 25:54.764
I think so, Mike.

25:55.560 --> 25:57.369
SELINA: What the hell was I reading?

25:58.640 --> 26:01.166
You were supposed
to take the submarine cuts out,

26:01.240 --> 26:03.607
not spend an extra 10 billion on them.

26:03.680 --> 26:05.603
- Now, give... Gary?
- Mmm-hmm?

26:06.240 --> 26:07.730
- Glasses.
- Yep.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.481
I mean, this speech

26:15.560 --> 26:19.645
was supposed to perfectly define
my presidency.

26:21.320 --> 26:23.402
Okay, you want to fix these?

26:23.480 --> 26:25.926
Whole cities of children

26:26.000 --> 26:28.446
were going to be saved from poverty.

26:28.520 --> 26:31.490
Instead now, that money

26:31.560 --> 26:34.689
is going to fund obsolete,

26:34.960 --> 26:36.121
metal,

26:36.680 --> 26:38.284
giant

26:38.360 --> 26:39.361
dildos.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.126
- Do you have any idea what...
-(PLASTIC SNAPS)

26:47.320 --> 26:49.243
You need to be far away from me.

26:49.920 --> 26:51.445
Get out of my office.

26:58.040 --> 26:59.724
- Okay.
-(KNOCK ON DOOR)

26:59.800 --> 27:02.565
Ma'am, I know
you need to be alone right now.

27:02.680 --> 27:04.205
It's just that these sign-offs...

27:05.280 --> 27:07.282
I'm just... I'll just leave 'em.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.771
- Yeah. (SCOFFS)
- Yeah.

27:09.120 --> 27:10.201
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

27:11.200 --> 27:13.521
Sorry, ma'am, you said not to interrupt,

27:13.600 --> 27:16.285
but we have a campaign meeting
scheduled for right now.

27:16.360 --> 27:17.361
I know, Amy.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.051
I'm de-scheduling as I exit.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.245
-(SIGHS)
-(KNOCK ON DOOR)

27:21.400 --> 27:23.801
Uh, Madam President,
I know you kicked me out,

27:23.880 --> 27:26.201
but we just droned
the wrong guy's truck in Yemen.

27:26.280 --> 27:27.281
Thank you, Ben.

27:27.360 --> 27:30.170
Great. Guess I'll write a report.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.924
- Hey, ma'am, I got your...
- SELINA: Get out!

27:32.000 --> 27:33.081
Yeah.

27:35.560 --> 27:36.561
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

27:37.320 --> 27:38.651
WOMAN: <i>Madam President. Sorry to interrupt.</i>

27:38.760 --> 27:41.525
<i>Just to let you know
that two of the hikers are dead.</i>

27:41.600 --> 27:43.364
SELINA: <i>Could you please leave?</i>

27:43.440 --> 27:45.363
WOMAN: <i>Sorry, Madam President.</i>

27:46.400 --> 27:48.084
SELINA: <i>Wait. What hikers?</i>

27:50.760 --> 27:52.125
<i>What hikers?</i>
