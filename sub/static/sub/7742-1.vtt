00:11.845 --> 00:13.304
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:13.389 --> 00:14.639
-Mommy!
-Mommy!

00:14.723 --> 00:17.266
I thought I'd swing by the hospital today,
take you out to lunch.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.435
Today's awful. Can I take a rain check?

00:19.520 --> 00:21.896
It's been raining a lot lately.

00:22.481 --> 00:25.024
Eddie, it's me.
I really need to see you this morning.

00:25.109 --> 00:27.527
So if you could just find me
as soon as you get in, that'd be great.

00:27.611 --> 00:28.611
Jacks.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.781
-You rang?
-My back is killing me.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.158
-For the pain.
-Thank you.

00:35.953 --> 00:39.330
Family at home, boyfriend at work,
making it back in time to be with husband...

00:39.415 --> 00:40.581
Pretty impressive.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.125
You have a little crush on Eddie?

00:42.209 --> 00:45.878
Yeah, Coop. I have a huge crush on Eddie.
We fuck every day at noon.

00:45.963 --> 00:49.257
-How are we on time?
-We're good. Just don't get fancy.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.511
Zoey!

00:53.971 --> 00:55.930
Mom, it's me, Fiona.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.724
So she has a kid.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.852
I cannot live
with Coop holding this over my head.

01:00.936 --> 01:03.771
If anyone knows how to drive him
round the bend, it's you.

01:04.773 --> 01:09.360
-You and I have amazing chemistry.
-You are a moron.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.780
I think that temp is on something.

01:12.865 --> 01:14.991
I don't know what your deal is.
We don't do that here.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.951
Takes one to know one.

01:17.703 --> 01:22.582
Your daughter Grace is experiencing
signs of Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.167
...just a bunch of fucking idiots.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.711
We're the parents.
We're going to decide what's best for her.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.880
They're replacing me with a Pyxis.

01:28.964 --> 01:32.091
They're going to replace you
with a fucking robot pill machine?

01:32.259 --> 01:34.135
Tylenol. Blow me.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.928
Ring, Jacks.

01:37.306 --> 01:38.598
Come on.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.808
How are you going to explain a
sawn-off wedding ring to Kevin?

01:40.893 --> 01:42.560
I will think of something.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.024
Is this for her broken finger?

01:48.108 --> 01:50.735
Got a little surprise for you
when you get off work.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.445
Who is luckier than me?

01:58.202 --> 02:00.620
-Hey. You open?
-Come on in.

02:02.164 --> 02:04.457
-Is that your wife?
-Jackie.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.421
I met Kevin.
And that's a very nice boy you got.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.048
You broke your own finger.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.508
Mommy...

02:13.634 --> 02:15.384
-Jacks.
-I think you're a saint.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.512
Every medication
removed from the machine

02:17.596 --> 02:21.974
will be traced back to your number,
and shortages will not be tolerated.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.878
-Hi.
-Well, hello.

04:15.297 --> 04:18.758
-I'm sorry. I'm married.
-Yeah? Lucky guy.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.617
Sorry. It's a little sunscreen.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.330
Jackie Peyton bought me a card?

04:50.415 --> 04:51.624
Maybe.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.714
She actually wrote feelings down?

04:58.799 --> 05:00.132
In cursive.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.890
-Yeah.
-I like you like this.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.823
You brought soap? She brought soap.

05:24.449 --> 05:27.576
Grace, honey, they're clean from the ocean.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.036
Not really.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.003
-What you got, Fi?
-I don't know, but it's really good.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.548
-Is it dead?
-I think it's a head.

05:40.632 --> 05:43.592
Yes, it looks like a raccoon head.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.679
Don't, honey! Don't touch it.
Do not touch it.

05:47.264 --> 05:48.973
Can I see your phone?

05:49.057 --> 05:51.434
-My phone?
-We're going to take a picture.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.854
All right. Knock yourself out.

05:58.358 --> 06:02.570
-We need to mail it. Now.
-We do? Right now?

06:04.031 --> 06:06.198
All right. You're the boss.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.327
-Fries?
-Yes, four please.

06:10.871 --> 06:14.623
I don't want fries.
They're not wearing gloves.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.958
Honey, it's okay.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.084
-So four or...
-Yes.

06:17.169 --> 06:19.670
-Three fries.
-Four... Okay, three.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.380
Coke, you guys? Root beer?

06:21.465 --> 06:23.507
-Coke.
-Grace?

06:23.633 --> 06:26.635
-Gracie? Coke?
-Coke, please.

06:27.304 --> 06:30.806
-I guess she's not talking to me.
-Four Cokes.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.392
It's getting a little old, that's all I'm saying.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.109
Are you okay?

06:43.403 --> 06:45.571
Jackie, are you okay?

06:48.658 --> 06:50.326
Yeah, yeah. A little too much sun, I think.

06:50.410 --> 06:54.330
-You got beers, right? Hey, you got beer?
-I will be with you in one minute.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.290
Man, those fucking girls drink a lot.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.167
-You mind?
-I like the short one.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.544
-She's got an ass like kaboom!
-Easy, guys.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.379
-We got kids here.
-She's, like, one drink away.

07:02.464 --> 07:06.383
Pop that thong and I'm in it, yo. Fuck!

07:06.468 --> 07:09.386
Sorry. We got to go. We're going. Goodbye.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.807
Don't fuck with her.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.462
She's a mother!

07:44.881 --> 07:48.467
-Was that a gunshot?
-.22 caliber, I'm guessing.

07:49.261 --> 07:52.388
-Shouldn't we...
-Go out there and get shot? No.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.393
Anybody hit? Security mobilized? Good.

07:58.562 --> 08:01.147
-Where were we?
-"Several questionable incidents."

08:01.231 --> 08:02.481
Yes.

08:03.692 --> 08:07.403
"Peripherally involved
with several questionable incidents.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.114
"Item, severed ear.

08:11.491 --> 08:15.411
"Item, Neil Nutterman.

08:16.997 --> 08:21.333
"Item, Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement."

08:22.794 --> 08:23.919
No.

08:24.004 --> 08:28.549
The emergency department of All Saints
has been flagged by the state of New York.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.927
And I have to ask myself,
"What's different?"

08:32.012 --> 08:35.472
Okay, but it's not me.
I'm not what's different.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.185
The Virgin Mary took one in the shoulder.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.687
What's going on?

08:41.771 --> 08:45.482
I was just telling Zoey here
that the shrinkage rate of our Pill-O-Matix

08:45.567 --> 08:47.776
has caught the attention of the state.

08:47.861 --> 08:51.614
-What can I tell you? It's a robot.
-This is unacceptable,

08:51.698 --> 08:54.617
-not to mention expensive.
-And illegal!

08:59.247 --> 09:02.124
Which is why I've asked Nurse Jackie
to talk to you today.

09:02.209 --> 09:07.338
The theme for today is,
this is not a candy machine, people.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.089
Jackie.

09:09.925 --> 09:12.301
Apparently, there's been a problem
with shrinkage.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.553
No! Not "apparently."

09:17.432 --> 09:19.058
Go ahead, Jackie.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.144
There's been a problem with shrinkage.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.897
And, frankly, any shrinkage
makes us all look bad,

09:24.981 --> 09:30.027
-even if it's just Imodium.
-And it's never just the Imodium, people.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.405
Sorry. Proceed.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.825
Okay, just so we are all on the same page.

09:36.910 --> 09:40.913
Let's say you get an EDP,
attending orders an H and A cocktail.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.082
You enter your PIN number.

09:46.211 --> 09:51.924
The machine will prompt you, patient ID.
One two-milligram vial of Ativan.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.510
The drawer pops open.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.470
Machine says
that there are 10 vials in the drawer.

09:56.554 --> 09:59.682
Hit "Confirm." You take one vial.

10:01.559 --> 10:04.603
Machine says nine vials remain.
Hit "Confirm."

10:06.773 --> 10:09.441
You do the same thing with the Haldol.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.362
So when you were up there,
I was watching everyone,

10:13.446 --> 10:19.785
you know, like I do,
and a lot of them look really guilty.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.206
-You don't think it's me, do you?
-Hey, Jackie!

10:28.128 --> 10:31.797
-We'd like a moment alone.
-No, we wouldn't. You can stay.

10:35.427 --> 10:39.430
-House seats. Hair. Fourth row.
-That's very impressive, Coop.

10:39.514 --> 10:42.725
Right? Takes place in the '60s.
Thought it might take you back.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.852
Okay. Very nice.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.897
-It'd be good for us to spend some time...
-"Us"? What "us"? There is no "us."

10:48.982 --> 10:51.692
I thought we got past this weeks ago.

10:57.282 --> 11:01.952
You know, Jackie, this whole
"Come here, go away" thing

11:02.454 --> 11:07.249
-is exhausting me. I'm just trying...
-There is no come here, it's all go away.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.501
Go away, okay? Just go away.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.342
What do I care?

11:16.426 --> 11:21.388
Trying to do something nice for a nurse,
who's a little bit older than me, by the way.

11:21.473 --> 11:24.725
Okay, thanks a lot.
I'm going to head back to work.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.607
I bet Thor would buy those
from you in a heartbeat.

11:31.691 --> 11:37.029
I mean, if you were at all thinking of...
My first perk!

11:45.914 --> 11:47.873
What are we waiting on?

11:48.792 --> 11:53.462
GSW. Four minutes. Really gruesome.

11:54.214 --> 11:57.549
I don't know why she wanted to send it
or why you like it, but there you have it.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.551
Kindred spirits, Jacks.

12:01.262 --> 12:04.765
I'm not really interested
in any long drawn-out anything,

12:04.849 --> 12:08.102
except to say that I am
executive of my mother's estate

12:08.186 --> 12:13.315
and, as such, it would mean the world
if I could set up a college fund for the girls,

12:13.400 --> 12:15.150
if for no other reason than taxes.

12:15.235 --> 12:19.822
That's very generous, thank you,
but you know it is not just up to me.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.532
Fiona sent me a picture of a dead animal,

12:21.616 --> 12:23.325
knowing full well it would be
the highlight of my day.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.078
-We're connected, Jacks.
-Yes, there's no denying that, honey.

12:26.162 --> 12:30.290
-That's all I'm asking, no strings attached.
-Let me talk to Kevin.

12:30.792 --> 12:34.670
Except, I get to be a godmother.
Don't care which one.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.840
-They already have godmothers.
-Not giving up.

12:39.592 --> 12:45.764
Ladies, this is Sam. He's our new RN.
You remember. He was a temp here.

12:45.974 --> 12:49.601
Yes, we remember him. Drug guy.

12:50.061 --> 12:51.854
I thought there was a hiring freeze.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.439
-No offense.
-No, none taken.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.315
I'm just totally grateful to be here.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.610
Yeah, okay. Excuse us a minute.

13:03.199 --> 13:06.577
You know I dismissed him because
he was wacked out on benzos, right?

13:06.661 --> 13:09.204
You do read my staffing reports.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.957
He successfully completed
a rehabilitation program.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.543
I have a stack of glowing
recommendations on my desk.

13:14.627 --> 13:18.130
Not to mention he speaks three languages
and he's a lot cheaper than you are.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.007
You get what you pay for.

13:20.091 --> 13:22.634
Mo-Mo was worth three times
what you paid him.

13:22.719 --> 13:25.429
And if the hospital is worried about
nurses stealing drugs,

13:25.513 --> 13:28.849
maybe you don't want to hire a nurse
who's an addict?

13:28.933 --> 13:31.268
-Former addict.
-No such thing.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.153
How you doing?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.490
Don't get too comfortable.

13:44.574 --> 13:47.576
New guy. Coop. High five.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.161
Okay, sure.

13:49.245 --> 13:53.207
Listen, I kind of feel like you're getting
a lot of the stabbings and gunshots lately.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.042
Mind if I take this one?

13:55.126 --> 13:59.546
Nothing would make me happier
than to give you a big, fat gunshot wound.

14:01.049 --> 14:03.425
We call those GSWs for short.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.177
Yeah.

14:10.600 --> 14:14.269
23-year-old female. Her dad's a cop.
She reached into the glove compartment,

14:14.354 --> 14:17.105
.357 magnum blew off the top of her palm
and three fingers.

14:17.190 --> 14:21.109
Index finger is hanging by a tendon.
The rest is wrapped up in the shirt.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.862
On my count. One, two, three.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.532
Okay.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.618
-Out of my way, big guy.
-Sorry.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.664
Hi, honey. My name is Jackie. You're okay.
You know where you are?

14:33.748 --> 14:35.332
We're going to give you
something for the pain.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.876
Are you allergic to any medicines?

14:38.378 --> 14:41.797
-You're okay. You're okay.
-Call Lois and have them prep the OR.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.048
Okay.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.302
What about plastics?

14:47.387 --> 14:49.471
She'll be lucky
if they can stabilize any of the bones.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.140
I think plastics should weigh in.
And look at her when you're talking.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.725
-Why?
-Because she's deaf.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.644
If they could stabilize the bones,
maybe do a vein graft...

14:55.728 --> 14:56.770
That's a big maybe.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.605
We're talking about
the hands of a deaf woman.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.440
-Fine. Call plastics.
-Okay, I will.

15:00.525 --> 15:01.817
Yeah? And they'll tell you the same thing.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.902
Twenty hours of surgery
for a non-life threatening injury?

15:03.987 --> 15:06.780
Fat fucking chance. It's pudding, Jackie.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.949
What the fuck are you doing over there?
You're officially useless.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.117
Get out.

15:10.201 --> 15:12.619
-Can I have some more gauze?
-Yes.

15:18.334 --> 15:21.420
You are mad at me.
Do not take it out on him.

15:21.504 --> 15:25.507
-Who? Who am I taking it out on?
-Thor. He's diabetic. You know that, right?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.677
The guy has a reaction, you go after him
like a bully on the playground.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.346
-That's classy, Coop.
-I didn't... How am I supposed to know?

15:31.431 --> 15:35.100
He wears a big fucking bracelet
that says, "I am diabetic."

15:47.947 --> 15:49.615
I'm sorry.

15:56.706 --> 16:00.042
-Totally worth it.
-Come with me.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.629
Someone call me when plastics gets here.

16:04.339 --> 16:07.549
I am so sorry. I didn't time my insulin right.

16:07.634 --> 16:11.219
You can't do that, Thor.
Nurses passing out on patients?

16:11.304 --> 16:12.971
-Not good.
-I know.

16:13.765 --> 16:16.850
It's a good thing it was Coop.
The other doctors don't scare so easy.

16:16.934 --> 16:20.312
God! He can't tell Akalitus that my blood
sugar dropped in trauma.

16:20.396 --> 16:26.318
She'll move me to the chemo ward
or maternity.

16:29.906 --> 16:33.200
-I love trauma.
-You just got to remember to eat.

16:34.035 --> 16:37.287
And you got to lay off the fried shit,
and the cake.

16:37.372 --> 16:40.165
Jesus, Thor. What is with you and cake?

16:40.249 --> 16:43.210
I don't drink. I don't smoke. I eat cake.

16:47.465 --> 16:50.425
-Cake is good.
-It's comfort food.

16:52.637 --> 16:57.015
Why do the things that are so bad for you
make you feel the best?

16:57.850 --> 16:59.267
I hear you.

17:17.870 --> 17:21.665
-I get why I make you nervous.
-I'm sorry?

17:21.749 --> 17:25.794
That time when I was fucked up
and I told you it takes one to know one?

17:25.878 --> 17:27.713
I had no right to say that.

17:27.797 --> 17:30.424
And I have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:30.508 --> 17:33.009
But if you ever want to talk
or go to a meeting...

17:33.094 --> 17:35.721
I'm sorry.
Can we get something straight right now?

17:35.805 --> 17:37.973
You and I are not buddies. You got it?

17:38.057 --> 17:39.891
-If you say so.
-Good.

17:44.105 --> 17:46.148
No, you listen to me.

17:46.232 --> 17:51.069
I spent my day off at a pathetic medical
equipment auction in New Jersey,

17:51.154 --> 17:54.197
bidding on a refurbished
Medfusion syringe pump for the ER.

17:54.282 --> 17:58.285
I won. I put it on my credit card.
You approved this.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.537
If I don't have a check on my desk
in the morning,

18:00.621 --> 18:03.749
I'm going to come down there
and kick your ass!

18:08.087 --> 18:11.173
Thank you, Monsignor. Have a good day.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.303
Come in.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.556
-Got a minute?
-Certainly.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.732
I need to lodge a formal complaint
against a nurse.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.650
Super.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.611
-It's Nurse Jackie.
-Really?

18:32.695 --> 18:39.117
She constantly challenges my decisions,
is bossy and rude and unpleasant.

18:39.744 --> 18:42.496
Bully. That's the word. She's a bully.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.875
There's a chain of command here
that she refuses to acknowledge.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.211
I am at the top of that chain of command,
okay?

18:49.295 --> 18:51.880
She is at the bottom and I am at the top.

18:51.964 --> 18:55.050
If this were a food pyramid,
I would be the steak.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.887
Technically, I think fats and oils
are at the top of the food pyramid, but...

18:58.971 --> 19:01.389
I am a good fucking doctor.

19:01.474 --> 19:06.102
And for a nurse, a nurse,
to be messing with my head

19:06.187 --> 19:07.896
by constantly undermining me?

19:07.980 --> 19:10.148
Am I going too fast?
'Cause I can slow down if you need me to.

19:10.233 --> 19:11.983
More time to write.

19:12.235 --> 19:15.695
What happens when a patient
gets wheeled in here one day,

19:15.780 --> 19:17.614
and that poor guy

19:17.698 --> 19:21.076
sees Jackie yelling at me
like I'm the world's biggest asshole?

19:21.160 --> 19:24.120
How do you think it makes the patient feel?

19:31.629 --> 19:34.464
I don't think it makes him feel any better.

19:34.549 --> 19:36.675
Thanks. I'll get into this.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.011
That was good.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.684
I feel better.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.437
That was good.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.077
His name is Mr. Merz.
He's the deaf woman's husband.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.746
He's having trouble with his insurance.
I didn't know what else to do.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.540
Okay, I got it.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.252
-Hey, Mr. Merz, my name is Jackie.
-They're saying we're not covered.

20:12.336 --> 20:15.463
I pay $425 a month. They're saying
they won't cover the procedure.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.216
Okay. Do you know if you have
something called catastrophic coverage?

20:18.301 --> 20:21.136
I don't know.
I've been on hold for 20 minutes.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.263
All right.
Why don't you let me talk to them?

20:23.347 --> 20:27.225
You go be with your wife
and I'll come and find you later. Okay?

20:27.310 --> 20:28.810
Go this way.

20:34.525 --> 20:35.984
You are absolutely right, Amanda.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.653
People should definitely
read their policies more closely,

20:38.738 --> 20:41.573
but she does have $50,000
in hospital coverage.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.576
That should take care of the surgery, right?

20:46.287 --> 20:49.581
Well, she's deaf,
so I think she does need her hand.

20:51.334 --> 20:53.793
A cost-per-finger breakdown?

20:53.878 --> 20:56.838
Okay, you know what?
Can I talk to your supervisor, please?

20:56.923 --> 20:58.673
What's his name?
Andrew, can you do me a favor?

20:58.758 --> 21:00.675
Will you walk me through this
like I'm an idiot?

21:00.760 --> 21:05.263
What is her per-day coverage? $3,000?

21:05.556 --> 21:10.644
She's racked up more than that in IV fluids.
So they are liable for the whole thing?

21:11.938 --> 21:15.106
Andrew, can I ask you a question?
Are you from the Midwest?

21:15.775 --> 21:18.360
Chicago. South Side.

21:18.444 --> 21:22.781
I think that South Side Irish is completely
different from West Side Irish,

21:22.865 --> 21:25.700
but that's just me. God, no. Queens.

21:25.952 --> 21:29.537
But my uncle moved out there
and sold beer at Comiskey, so I know.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.289
I'm going to go way out on a limb here...

21:31.374 --> 21:34.459
Have you ever been to Donohue's?

21:35.920 --> 21:40.215
Right! Yes, Peter and his brothers.
They are hilarious!

21:40.299 --> 21:44.177
No, I can't imagine selling people
something they can't use.

21:44.762 --> 21:46.721
It's got to be awful going to work every day.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.683
And then with your father
passing away like that...

21:49.767 --> 21:51.059
See, no, we've been
through this already, Andy.

21:51.143 --> 21:54.104
You do not need to talk to him.
This is your moment.

21:54.188 --> 21:57.899
You can do this. Step up, Andy.
You can do the right thing.

21:59.777 --> 22:01.027
All right. You know what?

22:01.112 --> 22:03.989
Why don't you just take the fax number?
You can do that, right?

22:09.453 --> 22:12.664
44-year-old male
swallowed a 30-count bottle of Xanax.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.541
Time-release,
so we've got a little wiggle room.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.710
-Don't know how many he took.
-I'm betting 30.

22:16.794 --> 22:18.920
Right. One, two, three.

22:20.965 --> 22:22.507
What do we got?

22:25.011 --> 22:26.302
Overdose.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.806
He's going to need to be lavaged.
Right. Roll him.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.726
-Jackie, I'd rather Sam be here.
-Yes, I bet you would.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.853
-How long ago did he ingest?
-I'm guessing 20.

22:34.937 --> 22:37.605
Let's drop in an NG
and give him charcoal and...

22:37.690 --> 22:39.524
Jackie, really. Go.

22:47.283 --> 22:49.534
Will you send in Sam, please?

22:58.294 --> 23:00.712
-You okay?
-Yeah. They need you in there.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.363
Are you sick?

23:29.325 --> 23:30.867
No, honey.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.248
Hi.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.501
What are you making?

23:41.420 --> 23:44.380
Yeah, there's cheddar cheese in the bin,

23:44.465 --> 23:47.675
and there's some English muffins
in the freezer.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.138
Yeah, do me a favor?
Can you check the date on those eggs?

23:52.223 --> 23:55.100
They've been sitting in there for a while.

23:58.604 --> 24:02.524
No, that's okay. You go take care of it.
I love you, too.

24:03.651 --> 24:04.734
Bye.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.719
-I am not responsible for that.
-I know.

24:38.060 --> 24:41.855
-The guy had to know it might kill him.
-He's a pharmacist, he should know better.

24:41.939 --> 24:45.567
Wheeled into the place that fired you?
That sucks.

24:45.651 --> 24:49.070
Would you guys shut up
or talk about something else?

25:01.167 --> 25:03.001
What did you just do?

25:05.087 --> 25:09.299
Hey. Look who's talking to me.

25:18.559 --> 25:19.976
Thank you.

25:24.190 --> 25:28.359
-You scared the shit out of me.
-That was the point.

25:31.030 --> 25:35.366
I'm a pharmacist.
I know exactly how much not to take.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.747
Nobody knows how much not to take.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.834
You look great, by the way.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.046
You are fucking psychotic.

26:07.483 --> 26:10.068
The Sun, Mercury, Venus,

26:11.445 --> 26:14.906
Earth, Mars, Saturn.

26:15.449 --> 26:17.033
You missed one.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.995
It's the one with all the moons.

26:21.956 --> 26:24.374
-Jupiter!
-Jupiter.

26:24.458 --> 26:25.625
It doesn't matter.

26:25.709 --> 26:29.712
The sun's going to explode
and eat up all the other planets anyways.

26:31.215 --> 26:32.257
Hey!

26:32.341 --> 26:37.303
-What are you doing home?
-I left early and I bought dinner.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.974
-Cake for dinner?
-Cake is good.

26:42.685 --> 26:46.396
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine. I get a corner piece.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.608
Let's have cake!
