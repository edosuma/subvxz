15:47.683 --> 15:48.985

Abra Kadabra, but--

But Sportsmaster got away
with the other prisoner.

15:53.789 --> 15:55.357
Still, over the last few weeks

15:55.424 --> 15:56.859
we've managed to cripple

15:56.926 --> 15:59.060
the Branchwater chain
of meta-human traffickers.

15:59.127 --> 15:59.996
Branchwater?

16:00.062 --> 16:01.931
A so-called
security firm

16:01.998 --> 16:04.033
owned by series
of shell companies

16:04.100 --> 16:06.535
that trace back
to Stagg Industries

16:06.602 --> 16:08.403
and its
majority shareholder,

16:08.470 --> 16:09.939
Simon Stagg.

16:10.006 --> 16:11.807
Branchwater uses
different methods,

16:11.874 --> 16:13.943
but is easily
as bad as Bedlam.

16:14.010 --> 16:16.312
It's basically
a meta-crime
covert ops unit

16:16.379 --> 16:18.580
that Stagg used
for corporate espionage.

16:18.647 --> 16:20.382
Or corporate warfare.

16:20.449 --> 16:21.684
Diana, we had identified

16:21.750 --> 16:23.319
three links in
the Branchwater chain,

16:23.386 --> 16:26.622
acquisition, coercion
and utilization.

16:26.689 --> 16:28.458
Link one, acquisition.

16:28.525 --> 16:31.827
Instead of creating
new meta-humans
as Bedlam did,

16:31.894 --> 16:34.163
Sportsmaster liberated
existing metas

16:34.230 --> 16:36.465
from prisons
and transports.

16:36.532 --> 16:38.301
Clayface, Livewire
and Mist,

16:38.368 --> 16:41.236
had all been taken
while en route
to Belle Reve.

16:41.303 --> 16:42.738
Link two, coercion.

16:42.805 --> 16:44.673
Instead of Bedlam's
control chips

16:44.740 --> 16:46.342
Branchwater had
Mad Hatter inject

16:46.409 --> 16:49.045
its newly
liberated convicts
with nanotech

16:49.112 --> 16:52.048
that forced them to follow
Branchwater's commands.

16:52.115 --> 16:53.950
Okay, yeah,
they're criminals.

16:54.016 --> 16:56.652
But they're criminals
being victimized by Stagg.

16:56.719 --> 16:58.421
Clayface, Livewire and Mist

16:58.488 --> 17:01.424
were all discovered
to have Hatter's nanotech
in their systems.

17:01.491 --> 17:04.961
Which would've been
Brick's fate had he
also been liberated.

17:05.027 --> 17:07.263
Finally, link three,
utilization.

17:07.330 --> 17:09.364
Cheshire ran missions
for Branchwater

17:09.431 --> 17:10.766
using the controlled metas

17:10.833 --> 17:12.001
for whatever
Stagg wanted
or needed.

17:12.068 --> 17:14.603

with Sportsmaster?

17:14.670 --> 17:16.005

if either knew

17:17.440 --> 17:19.809
both were employed
by the same organization.

17:19.875 --> 17:21.478
So the end result?

17:21.544 --> 17:23.813
Well, for starters,
no one's being
coerced anymore.

17:23.879 --> 17:25.447

</i> <i>Hatter's control devices</i>

Thanks, kid.

I used the same device
to release Livewire and Mist

17:37.160 --> 17:39.895
after Nightwing's group
left the Detroit airfield.

17:39.962 --> 17:42.064
Clayface, Kadabra,
Brick and Moon

17:42.131 --> 17:43.933
are now in
Belle Reve cells.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.301
And Mist
and Livewire?

17:45.368 --> 17:48.604
They are minors,
not hardened criminals.

17:48.671 --> 17:50.173
We believe
they are salvageable,

17:50.239 --> 17:52.241
and are seeking
another solution
for them both.

17:52.308 --> 17:53.809
And what about
this Stagg?

17:53.876 --> 17:55.578
Conner and I
took care of him.

17:55.645 --> 17:57.547

</i> <i>for receiving
</i> <i>stolen property.</i>

Reach device do?

18:02.952 --> 18:04.353
Why did Stagg want it?

18:04.419 --> 18:05.455
That's unclear.

18:05.522 --> 18:07.290
It was salvaged
from a Reach warship

18:07.357 --> 18:09.459
downed during
the battle against
the Warworld.

18:09.526 --> 18:12.028
Blue Beetle had
previously translated
the Reach text

18:12.094 --> 18:13.463
on the side
of the machine,

18:13.530 --> 18:16.366
and all it says is,
"Meta-human fail-safe."

18:16.432 --> 18:18.901
We believe Stagg
had grown paranoid.

18:18.968 --> 18:21.304
Because he was using
metas against others,

18:21.371 --> 18:24.240
he feared
someone else might use
metas against him.

18:24.307 --> 18:26.175
He thought the machine
would protect him against

18:26.242 --> 18:29.812
the "scary meta-world"
he himself was
helping to create.

18:29.879 --> 18:31.113
And it cost him,

18:31.180 --> 18:32.682
because I
anonymously
forwarded

18:32.749 --> 18:35.051
the evidence
we gathered
to the authorities.

18:35.117 --> 18:38.417
