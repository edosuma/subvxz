00:00.058 --> 00:02.942
Previously on AMC's Breaking Bad...

00:02.984 --> 00:04.513
Sooner or later someone is gonna flip.

00:04.633 --> 00:06.238
I've got nine guys.
They were part of the

00:06.346 --> 00:08.704
previous operation and they know a lot.

00:09.192 --> 00:11.000
My uncle's got his hookups in prison,

00:11.108 --> 00:12.736
I think could be
a real help to us if...

00:12.876 --> 00:14.740
I just wanna get my money and get out.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.019
If you leave, you get nothing!

00:17.177 --> 00:18.469
The names of your nine men.

00:18.556 --> 00:21.200
- You owe me that much.
- I don't owe you a damn thing.

00:22.145 --> 00:25.185
I just realized that Lydia has the names.
I can get them from her.

00:25.336 --> 00:26.914
Let me die in peace.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.066
Mr. White?

01:23.100 --> 01:24.901
Hello?

01:45.589 --> 01:48.741
Mr. White, the, uh,
car's been dealt with,

01:48.759 --> 01:50.260
sir.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.298
No one tailed you?

01:55.349 --> 01:57.016
No. I stayed off
the main streets

01:57.051 --> 01:59.218
and kept checking, so...

02:01.305 --> 02:03.640
Joe ask any questions?

02:03.691 --> 02:06.059
I told him RV job, just like you said,

02:06.093 --> 02:08.761
and he totally knew.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.370
It's pretty cool
the way they do that...

02:17.404 --> 02:20.740
Turn a car into a cube.

02:34.471 --> 02:38.958
So, should we deal
with this other thing now?

02:48.068 --> 02:49.769
Yeah.

02:51.822 --> 02:53.606
Sure.

03:08.321 --> 03:10.289
I don't want to talk about this.

03:10.323 --> 03:11.624
Okay.

03:11.658 --> 03:13.793
It had to be done.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.430
Okay.

03:18.882 --> 03:20.550
All right.

03:38.485 --> 03:40.570
I need to talk to you.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.354
In private.

03:49.213 --> 03:51.214
So what's the story?

03:51.248 --> 03:53.216
You get to Mike?

03:53.250 --> 03:54.384
Mm-hmm.

03:54.418 --> 03:56.719
He get out safe?

03:56.754 --> 03:58.721
He's gone.

03:58.756 --> 04:00.556
All right.

04:01.642 --> 04:05.094
Well, what about those nine guys in jail?

04:05.145 --> 04:08.181
They got no reason not to talk now.

04:08.215 --> 04:09.715
So what do we do?

04:09.733 --> 04:12.935
"We"? Who's "we"?

04:14.438 --> 04:16.572
There is no "we," Jesse.

04:16.607 --> 04:19.524
I'm the only vote left,

04:19.559 --> 04:22.077
and I'll handle it.

04:54.563 --> 04:59.766
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

05:27.119 --> 05:29.087
My client will supply vital information

05:29.121 --> 05:31.956
relating to the organization,
distribution, and production

05:31.974 --> 05:34.292
of Fring's methamphetamine enterprise.

05:34.310 --> 05:36.627
In exchange, we expect
all charges to be dropped,

05:36.645 --> 05:38.847
and Dennis not only
walks out of here a free man,

05:38.898 --> 05:40.482
but also receives blanket immunity.

05:43.319 --> 05:46.187
For what he's gonna be furnishing,
this deal is plenty fair.

05:49.992 --> 05:52.477
Best I'd be willing to do
is queen for a day

05:52.495 --> 05:53.811
and reduced charges.

05:53.829 --> 05:55.146
All charges dropped.

05:55.164 --> 05:57.148
Queen for a day
and a five-K.

05:57.166 --> 05:58.867
That's the best you're gonna get.

05:58.918 --> 06:01.286
No way.
Guys, come on.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.455
You can be a fairy princess,
for all I care.

06:03.489 --> 06:04.789
Where you going?

06:04.823 --> 06:06.291
I'm going shopping for someone

06:06.325 --> 06:07.992
who can tell me something
I don't already know.

06:08.010 --> 06:10.261
Hey, hey.

06:10.296 --> 06:12.597
I got plenty you don't know.

06:13.599 --> 06:15.666
You seem a little confused.

06:15.684 --> 06:17.352
This here is a buyer's market.

06:17.386 --> 06:19.804
I got eight other assholes just like you,

06:19.838 --> 06:21.973
four of them within 100 feet from here.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.975
I also got Dan the douche bag lawyer

06:24.009 --> 06:25.777
who's gonna give me the money
and Ehrmantraut.

06:25.811 --> 06:28.396
So settle in, Dennis.
Enjoy your new home.

06:28.447 --> 06:31.015
I'm gonna go rattle some cages.

07:13.576 --> 07:14.725
So?

07:14.743 --> 07:16.911
Maybe you should order something.

07:16.946 --> 07:18.913
Do you want a coffee or something?

07:18.948 --> 07:21.583
Not just now.

07:21.617 --> 07:24.619
I think this would play better
if you ordered something.

07:24.670 --> 07:28.089
I think this will play just
fine, and I'm not thirsty.

07:28.124 --> 07:30.575
So let's take a look at the list.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.879
Lydia, you've come all this way.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.881
- You do have the list?
- Yes, I have it.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.216
Good.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.051
It's just not written down.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.719
And why is that?

07:41.753 --> 07:44.305
It's in my head.
Safer there.

07:44.356 --> 07:45.807
I see.

07:45.858 --> 07:47.925
Then I suggest you pick up a pen.

07:47.943 --> 07:49.611
Not just yet.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.648
It was my understanding

07:53.699 --> 07:55.733
that attending to these nine names

07:55.767 --> 07:57.819
was precisely what you wanted.

07:57.870 --> 08:00.405
Ten names now.
Ten, counting the lawyer.

08:00.439 --> 08:03.541
Yes. Ten,
counting the lawyer.

08:03.576 --> 08:05.210
So, what,

08:05.244 --> 08:06.995
am I not tying up loose ends

08:07.046 --> 08:08.779
for our mutual benefit?

08:08.797 --> 08:11.966
You're tying up loose ends, and
I don't wanna be one of them.

08:12.001 --> 08:14.385
Once I give you that list,
I've served my purpose,

08:14.420 --> 08:16.804
and then maybe I'm just one
more person who knows too much.

08:18.591 --> 08:20.642
So, you put that list in my hands,

08:20.676 --> 08:22.510
and in your mind,

08:22.561 --> 08:25.980
I immediately just murder you,

08:26.015 --> 08:27.965
- just right here in this restaurant?
- No.

08:27.983 --> 08:30.852
- Right here in this public place,
immediately? - Not right here.

08:30.903 --> 08:32.854
- That is not what I...
- Listen, Lydia.

08:32.905 --> 08:35.523
You made me promise on my children's lives

08:35.573 --> 08:37.308
that I guaranteed your safety.

08:37.326 --> 08:38.976
From Mike.

08:38.994 --> 08:41.696
You guaranteed I'd be safe from Mike.

08:41.746 --> 08:44.365
There's no way
he'd ever go for this...

08:44.416 --> 08:47.252
You getting rid of his guys.

08:47.286 --> 08:49.704
You wouldn't be doing this...
The names...

08:49.755 --> 08:51.956
if Mike were still a factor.

08:56.595 --> 08:59.797
Yeah.
That's what I thought.

09:02.167 --> 09:05.019
What do you want, exactly?

09:05.054 --> 09:08.339
Because if you don't want
to give me that list,

09:08.357 --> 09:11.359
then I've truly got no use for you.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.731
I can grow your business exponentially.

09:16.782 --> 09:18.349
Just give me the list.

09:18.367 --> 09:20.518
I can do that by helping you expand

09:20.536 --> 09:22.453
into a larger, highly active,

09:22.488 --> 09:25.022
highly profitable marketplace.

09:25.040 --> 09:28.793
What do you know about the Czech Republic?

09:28.827 --> 09:30.712
The Czech Republic?

09:30.746 --> 09:32.714
Did you know there's
a higher demand for meth there

09:32.748 --> 09:34.666
than anywhere else in Europe?

09:34.700 --> 09:36.918
Five percent of its ten million people,

09:36.969 --> 09:39.504
which is roughly
the population of the Southwest

09:39.538 --> 09:41.756
from Western Texas to Phoenix,

09:41.807 --> 09:43.424
are using meth.

09:43.475 --> 09:45.260
You keep your market here,

09:45.311 --> 09:46.811
but by adding overseas sales,

09:46.845 --> 09:48.879
you can more than double
your current profits.

09:48.897 --> 09:50.381
And I checked.

09:50.399 --> 09:53.017
The average purity
is only about 60 percent.

09:53.051 --> 09:56.404
They've never seen
anything like your product.

09:57.406 --> 09:59.223
You'll blow their hair back.

10:01.193 --> 10:03.161
Shipping internationally

10:03.195 --> 10:05.496
seems like courting disaster.

10:05.531 --> 10:07.665
- Not if you're Madrigal.
- Madrigal

10:07.700 --> 10:10.084
is under investigation by the DEA.

10:10.119 --> 10:11.786
The restaurant division, mostly.

10:11.837 --> 10:13.871
We've got 46,000 employees

10:13.905 --> 10:16.073
spread across 14 divisions.

10:16.091 --> 10:19.177
And once Mike's people
are no longer a factor,

10:19.211 --> 10:21.179
things should tidy up nicely.

10:21.213 --> 10:22.847
This is what I do, you understand?

10:22.881 --> 10:25.850
I move things from point A to
point B all over the globe.

10:25.884 --> 10:28.052
1.2 million metric tons
a month,

10:28.086 --> 10:30.855
and all of it right at my fingertips,

10:30.889 --> 10:33.057
a laptop click away.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.728
The Czech Republic...

10:36.762 --> 10:38.730
Who's there on the other end?

10:38.764 --> 10:40.231
People I ship to regularly.

10:40.265 --> 10:41.733
People I've worked with for years.

10:41.767 --> 10:43.234
They're professional and very amenable.

10:43.268 --> 10:46.204
I'm very careful who I work with.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.912
And if this is such a slam dunk,

10:54.946 --> 10:56.998
then why didn't you pitch it to Fring?

10:57.049 --> 10:58.499
I did.
He said yes.

10:58.550 --> 11:00.951
We were in the final stages
of working it out

11:00.969 --> 11:02.670
when somebody killed him.

11:07.509 --> 11:09.477
You don't think Gus Fring

11:09.511 --> 11:12.146
built his distribution network
all by himself?

11:12.181 --> 11:15.266
There are considerable advantages

11:15.300 --> 11:17.968
to diversification of distribution,

11:17.986 --> 11:20.655
like putting 6,000 miles

11:20.689 --> 11:23.574
between you and your product.

11:24.827 --> 11:27.161
At 25 pounds a week,

11:27.196 --> 11:29.280
I'm estimating you'll gross
about two million.

11:31.149 --> 11:34.252
Give me ten pounds to start,
and we'll see how it goes.

11:37.172 --> 11:38.656
All right.

11:38.674 --> 11:40.591
Now, with Fring,

11:40.626 --> 11:42.377
my end was gonna be 30 percent,

11:42.428 --> 11:45.213
- which I believe is more than fair.
- Okay.

11:45.264 --> 11:47.515
- Trust me, if you do this...
- Lydia,

11:47.549 --> 11:50.385
learn to take yes for an answer.

11:51.670 --> 11:54.138
Now, first things first.

12:28.173 --> 12:30.040
Shake on it?

12:34.096 --> 12:36.514
We're going to make
a lot of money together.

14:04.367 --> 14:08.820
Todd, I think it's time I meet your uncle.

14:08.854 --> 14:10.822
No iron pile.

14:10.856 --> 14:13.491
There's too many muscle-heads
flexing their shit.

14:13.525 --> 14:14.993
Too many eyes.

14:15.027 --> 14:18.296
Okay, so no chow line, no yard.

14:18.331 --> 14:19.915
Gonna keep it simple.

14:19.966 --> 14:21.699
Pass-byes.

14:21.717 --> 14:25.420
Yeah. Hallways,
shower room, cells.

14:25.471 --> 14:27.205
The easy stuff.

14:27.223 --> 14:29.007
I say we go with a riot.

14:29.041 --> 14:30.875
Our boys get it done in a riot.

14:30.893 --> 14:32.894
No, no, no.
No chaos.

14:32.929 --> 14:37.148
I don't want the goon squad
rolling in and stealing our shot,

14:37.183 --> 14:39.150
you know?

14:39.185 --> 14:42.070
This has gotta be fast and quiet.

14:42.104 --> 14:44.222
Just boom, boom, boom.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.358
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

14:46.392 --> 14:48.693
Surgical.

14:48.727 --> 14:52.447
Surgical.
That's what it's gotta be.

14:52.498 --> 14:56.368
So how many guys we got at MDC?

14:56.402 --> 14:59.704
Three, counting Shaddock.

14:59.738 --> 15:01.206
And he makes the schedule now,

15:01.240 --> 15:04.242
so we can put who we need
where we need them.

15:04.260 --> 15:07.429
All right. So MDC's covered.
What about the rest?

15:07.463 --> 15:09.247
We need G block in Valencia, right?

15:09.265 --> 15:11.967
Our guy's on the night shift.

15:12.018 --> 15:13.768
- Have him pull a double.
- Nah.

15:13.803 --> 15:16.388
His supervisor's got
some hard-on about OT.

15:16.422 --> 15:18.773
Have him switch with somebody.
I don't know. Just get it done.

15:18.808 --> 15:22.060
Regardless, you know, we got
enough guys in Valencia right now?

15:22.094 --> 15:23.561
Might have to hire out.

15:23.595 --> 15:26.114
You high?
Mix blood with <i>chuntaros?</i>

15:26.148 --> 15:28.233
- No way.
- Well...

15:30.820 --> 15:33.989
There's no need.
We got enough.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.490
Hitters ain't the problem.

15:35.541 --> 15:38.609
- It's that short walking window
after lunch. - Mm-hmm.

15:38.627 --> 15:39.828
Yeah.

15:39.879 --> 15:42.280
It's gonna be tight.

15:42.298 --> 15:44.249
Real tight.

15:49.138 --> 15:51.589
You know, I gotta be straight
with you, man.

15:51.623 --> 15:54.125
Taking out all these guys is doable.

15:54.143 --> 15:57.846
But hitting them in three separate
jails all within two minutes?

15:57.897 --> 16:00.648
Whacking Bin Laden wasn't this complicated.

16:05.688 --> 16:08.440
Where do you suppose these come from?

16:08.474 --> 16:10.942
I've seen this one before.

16:10.976 --> 16:12.944
I wonder,

16:12.978 --> 16:14.946
are they all...

16:14.980 --> 16:17.165
in some giant warehouse someplace?

16:24.340 --> 16:25.507
Hey.

16:27.659 --> 16:31.262
It can be done,
just not the way you want it.

16:48.347 --> 16:51.983
It can be done exactly how I want it.

16:52.017 --> 16:56.037
The only question is,
are you the man to do it?

17:03.963 --> 17:06.881
Figure it out.

17:06.915 --> 17:09.700
That's what I'm paying you for.

18:22.625 --> 18:24.609
Aah!

19:22.301 --> 19:24.802
What's happening?

19:24.836 --> 19:27.472
Oh! Oh!

19:30.442 --> 19:33.010
No, man! Help me!

19:33.028 --> 19:35.179
Help me! Help!

19:35.197 --> 19:36.981
Help me!

19:48.877 --> 19:52.413
Excuse me a second.
Grab more photos, will you?

20:06.679 --> 20:07.812
Yes?

20:07.846 --> 20:09.681
<i>It's done.</i>

20:17.767 --> 20:21.841
<i>New details have emerged in the spate of
jail deaths that rocked central New Mexico</i>

20:21.870 --> 20:23.871
<i>three days ago.</i>

20:23.905 --> 20:27.215
<i>As of yet, no names of victims have been
released, but authorities continue</i>

20:27.576 --> 20:29.443
<i>to investigate what appears to be</i>

20:29.461 --> 20:32.379
<i>a carefully coordinated sequence of attacks</i>

20:32.414 --> 20:34.548
<i>that occurred within minutes of one another</i>

20:34.583 --> 20:37.001
<i>in three different</i>
<i>correctional facilities...</i>

20:37.052 --> 20:39.170
- Is it okay if I turn this off?
- Oh, sure.

20:39.221 --> 20:40.971
I don't want the news on right now.

20:41.006 --> 20:44.425
Hank just pulled up,
and he's not in the best mood.

20:44.459 --> 20:46.627
Oh, all right.
Well, I'll get out of your hair.

20:46.645 --> 20:48.179
Okay.

20:48.230 --> 20:50.064
Hi, honey.

20:50.098 --> 20:51.565
Mwah!

20:51.600 --> 20:54.151
Dinner will be in about an hour.

20:55.570 --> 20:58.489
And I thought we could have
that chicken that you like.

20:58.523 --> 21:01.141
Or... or we could
order Chinese?

21:01.159 --> 21:04.276
- Sure.
- There you go.

21:04.311 --> 21:06.280
There you are.

21:06.314 --> 21:09.283
Wanna play with your toys?

21:09.317 --> 21:11.485
I'll see you in a little bit, okay?

21:11.503 --> 21:13.153
See you in a little bit.

21:13.171 --> 21:15.506
Hey, Hank.
I was just getting ready to leave.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.007
Want a drink?

21:17.042 --> 21:20.010
Um, yeah, sure. Thanks.

21:20.045 --> 21:22.096
Perfect.

21:24.966 --> 21:27.635
- Rocks, right?
- Rocks, yes.

22:34.252 --> 22:37.588
Been thinking about
this summer job I used to have.

22:38.873 --> 22:40.624
Oh, yeah?

22:42.427 --> 22:45.262
Back in college, I'd spend my days...

22:46.798 --> 22:49.850
marking trees in the woods
with this...

22:49.884 --> 22:52.603
this orange spray can.

22:54.422 --> 22:56.223
Marking trees?

22:56.257 --> 22:59.092
Yeah. Crews would
come in later

22:59.110 --> 23:02.146
and find the trees I tagged
and cut them down.

23:06.451 --> 23:08.986
First, you go in, and you mark locations

23:09.037 --> 23:12.323
for skid trails and landings.

23:12.374 --> 23:14.325
Then you choose specific trees

23:14.376 --> 23:17.244
all within a selected grid.

23:20.548 --> 23:22.666
Every day,

23:22.717 --> 23:25.135
I'd go back,

23:25.170 --> 23:27.454
hike in,

23:27.472 --> 23:30.290
pick up where I left off.

23:34.262 --> 23:37.097
Oh. Sounds nice,

23:37.131 --> 23:39.767
being out in the woods all day.

23:39.801 --> 23:41.769
Nah, it wasn't so great.

23:41.803 --> 23:44.571
I got sunburned.
There were mosquitoes.

23:44.606 --> 23:46.657
I just wanted to make a few bucks.

23:46.691 --> 23:48.642
Buy beer.

23:50.779 --> 23:53.614
Been thinking about that job
more and more lately.

23:54.982 --> 23:58.168
Maybe I should've enjoyed it more.

23:58.203 --> 24:01.705
Tagging trees is a lot better
than chasing monsters.

24:16.504 --> 24:19.106
I used to love to go camping.

28:09.420 --> 28:12.372
This way. Here, baby girl.
Come see your brother.

28:12.406 --> 28:14.508
There you go, sweetie.
That's it.

28:14.542 --> 28:16.760
Oh, my God!
Look at her go!

28:16.794 --> 28:18.261
Good job!

28:18.296 --> 28:20.097
- Peekaboo. This way.
- Good job!

28:20.131 --> 28:21.748
Here. Let's go see your brother.
Let's get him.

28:21.766 --> 28:23.750
- Get him!
- Where'd you go?

28:23.768 --> 28:25.752
I can't see you.
Where'd you go?

28:25.770 --> 28:28.889
There you are!

28:28.923 --> 28:31.925
You're really good with her.

28:31.943 --> 28:33.644
Come here, my baby girl.

28:33.695 --> 28:36.813
You're gonna be a handful,
aren't you? Yeah.

28:36.864 --> 28:39.900
Mama's gonna get her exercise.
Aw.

28:42.737 --> 28:45.772
Hey, do you, uh... You wanna watch a movie?

28:45.790 --> 28:48.659
Hey, Louis.

28:48.710 --> 28:50.276
Uh...

28:50.294 --> 28:51.945
One moment.

28:51.963 --> 28:53.714
Uh, nothing.

28:53.748 --> 28:56.083
What's up?

29:00.638 --> 29:02.673
Oh, well.

29:08.763 --> 29:11.982
It's nice to see you smile again.

29:12.016 --> 29:15.152
I mean, you seem good.

29:16.270 --> 29:18.605
Yeah.
I'm hanging in there.

29:19.991 --> 29:22.976
To see you laugh like that just now...

29:23.011 --> 29:26.380
It's such an improvement, don't you think?

29:28.149 --> 29:31.918
I don't...
I don't really...

29:35.757 --> 29:39.026
We've been thinking,

29:39.060 --> 29:42.496
Hank and I, that...

29:42.530 --> 29:46.349
it may be time to take the kids home.

29:48.936 --> 29:51.688
It's been almost three months, right?

29:51.723 --> 29:54.641
Almost three?

29:54.675 --> 29:56.026
Um...

29:57.895 --> 30:00.230
D-does Hank not want...

30:00.281 --> 30:03.200
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, God. No. No.

30:03.234 --> 30:06.319
Hank's crazy for these kids.
You know that.

30:06.353 --> 30:08.855
It goes without saying,
we love having them.

30:08.873 --> 30:10.791
And we're always here for you

30:10.825 --> 30:14.661
and wanna help you any way that we can.

30:14.695 --> 30:16.630
But...

30:19.033 --> 30:21.752
We're starting to worry

30:21.803 --> 30:24.671
that maybe...

30:26.874 --> 30:29.375
Maybe we're enabling you.

30:33.547 --> 30:36.382
Sweetie, you've had a lot on your plate,

30:36.400 --> 30:40.487
and you and Walt
have had a lot...

30:40.521 --> 30:44.407
so much to contend with.

30:44.442 --> 30:48.245
And I'm so proud of you for going to
therapy, by the way. You know that, right?

30:48.279 --> 30:50.697
It can be so helpful, such a good tool.

30:50.731 --> 30:54.785
And I'm very, very proud of you,

30:54.836 --> 30:56.620
but I...

30:56.671 --> 30:58.672
We...

31:00.407 --> 31:03.760
Maybe at this point,

31:03.795 --> 31:05.712
the best way

31:05.746 --> 31:08.014
to help repair the family

31:08.049 --> 31:11.685
would be to repair the family,

31:11.719 --> 31:13.220
you know?

32:21.672 --> 32:24.007
Take a drive with me.

32:49.700 --> 32:51.534
Walt.

33:13.591 --> 33:15.558
This is it.

33:17.311 --> 33:20.546
This is what you've been working for.

33:22.350 --> 33:25.235
I rented this place,
and I started bringing it here,

33:25.269 --> 33:27.237
because...

33:27.271 --> 33:30.941
I didn't know what else to do.

33:30.992 --> 33:33.660
I gave up counting it.
I mean, I had to.

33:33.694 --> 33:35.912
It was just so much, so fast.

33:35.947 --> 33:39.616
I... I tried
weighing it.

33:39.667 --> 33:42.068
I figured one bill

33:42.086 --> 33:44.570
of any denomination weighs a gram.

33:44.588 --> 33:47.257
There are 454 grams to a pound,

33:47.291 --> 33:50.243
but...

33:51.379 --> 33:55.432
there's a variety of denominations,

33:55.466 --> 33:57.250
so...

33:58.886 --> 34:01.137
How much is this?

34:03.024 --> 34:05.442
I have no earthly idea.

34:07.061 --> 34:09.062
I truly don't.

34:10.063 --> 34:12.899
I just stack it up, keep it dry,

34:12.933 --> 34:15.284
spray it for silverfish.

34:18.105 --> 34:20.322
There is more money here

34:20.373 --> 34:23.409
than we could spend in ten lifetimes.

34:23.444 --> 34:25.911
I certainly can't launder it,

34:25.946 --> 34:28.614
not with 100 car washes.

34:32.636 --> 34:34.471
Walt...

34:35.956 --> 34:39.059
I want my kids back.

34:40.177 --> 34:44.681
I want my life back.

34:45.815 --> 34:48.685
Please tell me...

34:48.735 --> 34:50.687
How much is enough?

34:50.737 --> 34:54.940
How big does this pile have to be?

36:11.080 --> 36:12.164
Ow!

36:12.198 --> 36:14.166
Aw, shit!

36:46.415 --> 36:48.166
Hi.

36:48.201 --> 36:50.085
Hey.

36:50.119 --> 36:52.370
Um, I...

36:52.404 --> 36:55.290
I hope I'm not disturbing you or anything.

36:55.341 --> 36:56.791
I tried calling,
but, uh...

36:56.842 --> 36:59.461
Yeah. No, I, uh,
tossed all my burners.

36:59.512 --> 37:02.430
Oh. And you didn't answer
your home line, so...

37:02.465 --> 37:04.382
It's disconnected.

37:04.416 --> 37:07.886
Oh, um, unplugged, I mean.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.889
Did you leave a message, or...

37:10.923 --> 37:13.225
Uh, no.

37:15.728 --> 37:18.363
So, what's up?

37:18.397 --> 37:21.366
I was just in the neighborhood,

37:21.400 --> 37:25.320
so I thought I'd drop by and say hello.

37:29.441 --> 37:33.111
You, uh, wanna come in, or...

37:33.129 --> 37:35.113
Uh, sure.

37:35.131 --> 37:36.631
Thanks.

37:50.146 --> 37:53.014
You know, I'd offer you a...
a beer or something, but...

37:53.065 --> 37:55.100
No, no. No, I'm...
I'm...

37:55.134 --> 37:58.136
I'm... I'm fine, thanks.

37:58.154 --> 38:01.523
You, uh, didn't wind up moving, I see.

38:01.574 --> 38:03.608
Didn't have to.

38:03.642 --> 38:06.328
Saul told me what you did.

38:09.815 --> 38:13.702
Anyways, uh, I'm not in jail.

38:13.753 --> 38:17.289
You aren't either, so there you go.

38:18.324 --> 38:20.592
There was no other option, Jesse.

38:20.626 --> 38:23.044
It had to be done.

38:27.216 --> 38:29.217
I'm not coming back.

38:30.669 --> 38:32.887
I know.

38:32.938 --> 38:35.506
So why are you here,

38:35.524 --> 38:37.392
exactly?

38:44.867 --> 38:47.518
It's funny. I...

38:47.536 --> 38:50.488
I saw a Bounder the other day.

38:50.522 --> 38:52.791
- Bounder?
- Yeah.

38:52.825 --> 38:55.126
Our RV?
A Bounder?

38:55.161 --> 38:57.829
Oh. Oh.

38:57.863 --> 39:00.832
Oh, you saw the same one as ours?

39:00.866 --> 39:04.169
Yeah. Well, within a
couple years, I guess.

39:04.203 --> 39:05.503
Early '80s.

39:05.537 --> 39:07.505
It was certainly in a lot better shape

39:07.539 --> 39:09.057
than our old hunk of junk.

39:09.091 --> 39:12.344
A much nicer paint job.

39:12.378 --> 39:15.480
No bullet holes in the door.

39:15.514 --> 39:18.600
Yeah. That thing
was a nightmare, huh?

39:18.651 --> 39:21.936
Oh, it was primitive.

39:21.987 --> 39:24.272
You know, whenever I hit a red light,

39:24.323 --> 39:26.908
I used to pray

39:26.942 --> 39:29.694
it wouldn't crap out on me.

39:29.728 --> 39:31.196
Yeah.

39:31.230 --> 39:34.899
And then, suddenly,
it would sometimes have that...

39:34.917 --> 39:37.252
that screeching sound that
just... out of the blue,

39:37.286 --> 39:39.204
like we hit a pack of cats.

39:39.238 --> 39:42.507
Power steering belt.
That's what that was.

39:42.541 --> 39:44.709
I always had this...

39:44.743 --> 39:46.795
this whole system...

39:46.846 --> 39:49.631
strategy... to not let
it idle too low.

39:49.682 --> 39:52.250
Remember that time we ran out
of gas coming back from a cook?

39:52.268 --> 39:55.253
Ah, the gauge.
The gauge always said half-full, so...

39:55.271 --> 39:57.939
Yeah, you had to walk three
miles with a jerry can

39:57.973 --> 39:59.941
while I waited on the side of the road,

39:59.975 --> 40:03.278
praying the whole time
that no cop would show up,

40:03.312 --> 40:04.946
no good samaritan.

40:04.980 --> 40:06.815
God.

40:06.866 --> 40:08.316
We had money.

40:08.367 --> 40:10.735
Why'd we keep it?

40:10.769 --> 40:13.705
Why did we have to have
the world's shittiest RV?

40:13.739 --> 40:16.458
- Inertia?
- Yeah.

40:17.710 --> 40:19.327
Yeah.

40:19.378 --> 40:21.379
Inertia.

40:35.144 --> 40:38.179
So, hey, um, you know, I gotta get going.

40:38.230 --> 40:40.598
- Yeah. No, me too. - I'm just
meeting up with some friends, and...

40:40.632 --> 40:42.984
I gotta get going as well.

40:48.657 --> 40:50.658
I left something for you.

42:25.921 --> 42:27.738
Hey.

42:40.135 --> 42:42.270
I'm out.

42:48.894 --> 42:50.895
I'm out.

43:39.445 --> 43:41.412
With some big earrings,
it could be really nice.

43:41.447 --> 43:44.666
Perhaps some big hoops.
I feel like I just want

43:44.700 --> 43:46.834
to mix it up with my hair this summer.

43:46.869 --> 43:49.170
- You know, like color...
- Yeah. I don't know.

43:49.204 --> 43:51.673
Did you have a coin collection?
I had coins.

43:51.707 --> 43:54.509
...have the time
to do hobbies.

43:54.543 --> 43:57.662
Coins and baseball cards.
Those were the ones.

43:57.680 --> 44:00.131
You can play around with it
and take them in and out...

44:00.165 --> 44:02.050
Not enough hours in the day, right?

44:02.101 --> 44:04.886
- Not enough hours...
- My hairstylist told me

44:04.937 --> 44:07.055
to take prenatal vitamins.

44:07.106 --> 44:08.606
For your hair?

44:08.641 --> 44:11.225
He said they work, so I figure why not?

44:11.276 --> 44:13.177
Oh, uh, Flynn,

44:13.195 --> 44:15.363
could you put some more sunscreen on Holly?

44:15.397 --> 44:17.315
Yeah.
Is it over there?

44:17.349 --> 44:18.900
- Yeah, it's right here.
- Okay.

44:18.951 --> 44:20.785
...for a home brew,
though.

44:20.819 --> 44:22.787
Papa-free.
That's good.

44:22.821 --> 44:25.990
- Although I don't know why it would be bad.
- Yeah. I know. Me neither.

44:26.024 --> 44:28.743
Oh, do you... I used to squeeze
lemon juice in my hair.

44:28.794 --> 44:30.078
You remember that?

44:30.129 --> 44:33.414
You wanted to be a beach bum so badly.

44:33.465 --> 44:34.916
- I did.
- Ohh.

44:34.967 --> 44:37.802
You and your stiff hair.

44:37.836 --> 44:41.472
- Stiff what?
- Hey, hey.

44:41.507 --> 44:43.874
I was interested to see you get into that.

44:43.892 --> 44:46.594
- Borage oil is supposed to be good.
- It's like chemistry.

44:46.645 --> 44:48.846
- Is it really? Better than flaxseed?
- I don't know.

44:48.880 --> 44:50.765
That's cool.
I like your style.

44:50.816 --> 44:53.184
There is no Christmas.
There is no Christmas...

44:53.218 --> 44:54.819
Maybe I should brew up a batch.

44:54.853 --> 44:56.387
- What do you think?
- Ooh, Schraderbrau?

44:56.405 --> 44:57.739
- Yeah.
- I vote yes.

44:57.773 --> 44:59.023
I second that.

44:59.057 --> 45:00.575
Well, there you go.
It's unanimous.

45:00.609 --> 45:02.076
Well, who am I to fly

45:02.111 --> 45:04.696
in the face of public demand, right?

45:08.400 --> 45:11.753
All right. Hold on.

45:11.787 --> 45:14.422
Anybody, uh... anybody want anything?
Want anything?

45:14.456 --> 45:16.207
No, I'm good.
I'm good, thank you.

45:16.241 --> 45:17.875
All right.

45:17.909 --> 45:20.077
Does it look glossier?

45:20.095 --> 45:22.430
- Do I have a halo?
- I don't know.

45:22.464 --> 45:25.082
- How's she doing?
- She's good.

45:25.100 --> 45:27.468
- I used to have that halo.
- Yeah.

45:46.605 --> 45:49.040
Ahhh.

46:32.059 --> 46:34.335
<i>"To W.W., my star,</i>

46:34.369 --> 46:36.704
<i>my perfect silence."</i>

46:36.755 --> 46:39.323
<i>W.W.</i>

46:39.341 --> 46:41.759
I mean, who do you figure
that is, you know?

46:41.794 --> 46:43.511
Woodrow Wilson?

46:43.545 --> 46:46.047
Willy Wonka?

46:48.684 --> 46:50.635
Walter White?

46:53.305 --> 46:55.223
You got me.
