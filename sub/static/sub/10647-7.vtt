WEBVTT

00:06.941 --> 00:07.929
This is Spider One.

00:07.954 --> 00:09.948
What's your status,
Spider Four? Any sign?

00:09.973 --> 00:13.303
I am not using these stupid
code names Iron Spider made up.

00:13.358 --> 00:16.561
Isn't Iron Spider already a codename?

00:16.717 --> 00:19.894
Brooklyn's clear to the bridge.
No sign of Vulture.

00:20.008 --> 00:23.405
Aw, come on, the code names are sweet.
Queens is...

00:23.859 --> 00:25.606
pretty yummy, by the way.

00:25.642 --> 00:27.849
And pretty empty of Bird Boy.

00:27.883 --> 00:31.809
Oh, Spider Three, out.

00:31.918 --> 00:33.865
I just finally picked a superhero name,

00:33.900 --> 00:35.764
and now you want to use code names?

00:35.790 --> 00:37.458
I'm with Scarlet on this one.

00:37.532 --> 00:39.614
Anyway, Staten Island's clear.

00:39.639 --> 00:42.816
Sorry, Iron Spider. Looks like majority
voted down the code names.

00:43.183 --> 00:44.291
Iron Spider?

00:44.682 --> 00:45.669
You still with us?

00:45.792 --> 00:48.732
Unfortunately. Listening
to all of you babbling.

00:48.757 --> 00:51.064
If you aren't on board, then
I'm following my own course

00:51.089 --> 00:52.771
of action in finding Subject V.

00:52.796 --> 00:55.398
Whoa, you can't do that.
Can you do that?

00:55.552 --> 00:57.497
<i>Just find Vulture's location
before Doc Ock</i>

00:57.522 --> 00:59.398
<i>can round him up for the new
Sinister Six.</i>

00:59.434 --> 01:02.731
My new scanning methods are
too complex for me to bother explaining,

01:02.770 --> 01:04.809
but trust me, I'll find a match.

01:10.189 --> 01:11.986
I'm going to finally take him down.

01:12.131 --> 01:13.739
Gotcha, Subject V.

01:13.765 --> 01:15.518
Don't move or you're dust.

01:16.016 --> 01:17.081
Fail.

01:17.690 --> 01:19.974
Looks like your scanning
methods need some work, Cho.

01:19.999 --> 01:22.789
Obviously I need to update
my search parameters.

01:22.790 --> 01:25.166
Cho, we're not out to destroy Vulture.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.981
We need to bring him in peacefully.

01:27.059 --> 01:29.095
I'm afraid you're not decisive enough,

01:29.120 --> 01:31.225
always giving villains
the benefit of the doubt...

01:31.250 --> 01:34.222
And now Subject V is still out
there, more dangerous than ever.

01:34.247 --> 01:37.146
Subject V? Why don't you just
call him by his real name?

01:37.949 --> 01:39.000
Vulture.

01:42.584 --> 01:44.395
Because he's a vicious creature.

01:44.420 --> 01:45.749
He's a person.

01:45.870 --> 01:47.945
It's not his fault
what Doc Ock did to him.

01:47.970 --> 01:50.268
Just stay here. I've got this, Cho.

01:50.301 --> 01:53.144
- Call me Spider Two!
- As if.

01:57.637 --> 02:00.785
Hey, buddy. Remember me?
Your friend Spidey?

02:00.810 --> 02:02.385
You like to try to destroy me?

02:02.458 --> 02:04.199
There's still a guy in there, right?

02:04.248 --> 02:06.706
A nice, decent guy
who just wants to let me help?

02:06.731 --> 02:08.078
We can get some bird seed together.

02:08.103 --> 02:09.823
- Maybe...
- Freeze, Subject V.

02:11.585 --> 02:13.672
Hey, wait. Vulture, stop. Whoa!

02:13.701 --> 02:16.701
I told you. He's a vicious creature!

02:16.927 --> 02:19.604
Person!

02:31.516 --> 02:35.480
Whoa! Whoa! You know, I'm
perfectly okay traveling by web.

02:36.469 --> 02:39.248
Okay, I can take a hint, Vulture.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.133
You're not up for a conversation.

02:45.971 --> 02:48.385
I told Spider-Man, Subject
V can't be reasoned with.

02:50.343 --> 02:53.607
Vulture. Seriously. I am
trying to help you.

02:53.642 --> 02:55.881
Hang on.
I've got a target lock.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.017
Target lock? On who?

03:01.435 --> 03:01.939
Ah!

03:01.964 --> 03:03.345
Whoa!

03:04.150 --> 03:06.106
Whoa! Hey! Whoa!

03:06.976 --> 03:08.729
You were aiming
for the water, right?

03:08.768 --> 03:09.968
That was on purpose?

03:10.028 --> 03:11.934
His pattern is too erratic.

03:11.959 --> 03:14.597
Whoa! I've noticed!

03:14.622 --> 03:16.231
Whoa!

03:16.256 --> 03:19.352
Hey, Iron Spider,
did you forget about me?

03:20.865 --> 03:22.634
Okay, you guys are busy.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.307
Guess my target lock
could use some work, too.

03:26.944 --> 03:29.637
Get out of here, Cho.
You're not helping!

03:29.885 --> 03:32.990
- Stop coddling him. He's just a...
- Don't say it.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.878
Okay, maybe I could use some help.

03:42.968 --> 03:45.007
Easy, pal. Easy.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.778
Just settle down so we can...

03:47.125 --> 03:49.300
Fall to our doom!

03:59.266 --> 04:01.324
I knew I should have
brought my beach ball today.

04:04.086 --> 04:05.340
Hey, don't blame me.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.628
I didn't tell you to nose dive
into Hudson Bay.

04:09.204 --> 04:11.172
You know I'm not trying
to hurt you, right?

04:11.484 --> 04:13.276
Get away from him, you monster!

04:13.333 --> 04:15.270
Iron Spider! No!

04:34.766 --> 04:36.683
And there he goes.

04:36.801 --> 04:38.886
Remind me why I want you
on my team again?

04:39.063 --> 04:42.546
Spider-Man, time to change the
parameters of your leadership.

04:42.659 --> 04:44.815
Your inability to see villains
for what they are

04:44.851 --> 04:46.598
repeatedly gets us into trouble.

04:46.623 --> 04:48.995
They're either with us or against us.

04:49.050 --> 04:50.974
Not everything's
that black and white, Cho.

04:50.999 --> 04:54.808
Sorry I don't subscribe to your "blast
first, ask questions never" philosophy.

04:55.020 --> 04:59.057
Maybe you didn't notice, but I
just saved you from the monster.

04:59.103 --> 05:00.690
He's not a monster.

05:00.880 --> 05:03.343
If you remember, he almost
joined S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy.

05:03.535 --> 05:04.678
But he didn't.

05:04.703 --> 05:08.363
Monsters are like computer viruses.
You can't reason with them.

05:08.388 --> 05:11.508
First he's a creature. Then
he's a monster. Now he's a virus?

05:11.533 --> 05:14.026
He's a chaotic variable
that needs to be stopped.

05:14.051 --> 05:15.813
And you need to recognize that.

05:15.946 --> 05:18.565
You can't reduce everything
to numbers and formulas.

05:18.600 --> 05:19.892
This is a real person we're...

05:20.978 --> 05:21.969
- Huh?
- Huh?

05:21.994 --> 05:24.847
Was that, like a cute little earthquake?

05:28.128 --> 05:29.163
Sand.

05:29.980 --> 05:31.164
It's sand.

05:31.265 --> 05:33.993
Yes, it is sand, Spider-Man.

05:34.018 --> 05:37.093
Are you sure you didn't hit your head
when you crashed into the water?

05:37.534 --> 05:39.897
You don't understand. We've got to...

05:46.294 --> 05:47.975
It isn't just sand.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.442
It's the Sandman.

05:51.964 --> 05:54.514
Do you think Subject V
knew Subject S was here?

05:54.553 --> 05:55.932
Enough with the code names.

05:55.966 --> 05:57.515
Vulture totally set us up.

05:57.550 --> 05:59.289
Tag! You're it.

06:09.723 --> 06:10.913
How do you stop him?

06:10.937 --> 06:13.019
He's completely inconsistent matter.

06:13.038 --> 06:14.365
Spike!

06:14.505 --> 06:15.657
I gotcha.

06:20.241 --> 06:21.510
Playtime!

06:21.535 --> 06:24.122
You have a weird definition
of "playtime."

06:27.049 --> 06:28.139
Woo-hoo!

06:28.174 --> 06:29.329
Ha-ha!

06:30.507 --> 06:31.407
Ah!

06:32.972 --> 06:34.002
You're it.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.405
I'm it? What's wrong with you, Flint?

06:36.430 --> 06:37.405
Ha!

06:45.027 --> 06:47.615
Freeze webs. I used the
suit's coolant fluid.

06:47.650 --> 06:49.071
I'm a genius, remember?

06:49.111 --> 06:50.085
If I ever forget,

06:50.110 --> 06:51.972
I'm sure you'll manage to remind me.

06:51.997 --> 06:55.622
Okay, let's figure a way to get Sandman
back to S.H.I.E.L.D. before he thaws out.

06:55.658 --> 06:58.356
- He was acting kind of like...
- Like a rampaging monster?

06:58.391 --> 07:01.320
Yep. Sure was. Or a child.

07:01.578 --> 07:03.156
Which makes no sense.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.281
Huh?

07:12.958 --> 07:15.534
Split into two? He
can't do that, right?

07:15.559 --> 07:17.435
Catch the spiders!

07:17.515 --> 07:20.524
No, crush the spiders!

07:20.549 --> 07:21.452
Woo-hoo!

07:22.361 --> 07:24.007
Apparently he can now.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.349
You know me, Sandman.

07:30.374 --> 07:32.806
I'm not one to turn down
a chance to play at the beach.

07:35.136 --> 07:37.396
Why won't you let me tag you?

07:38.689 --> 07:40.351
Your tags are a little intense.

07:47.689 --> 07:50.521
Didn't expect to be playing
"Tag, you're smashed" today.

07:51.516 --> 07:53.318
Where are you hiding?

07:53.446 --> 07:55.221
You're not being very nice.

07:55.774 --> 07:58.191
And this just keeps getting weirder.

08:01.733 --> 08:04.107
Thrusters are down. Reroute power.

08:05.925 --> 08:07.897
Three. Two. One.

08:12.105 --> 08:12.930
Hey, Cho.

08:12.955 --> 08:14.793
You get tired of beach games, too?

08:16.355 --> 08:20.137
How could Subject S possibly divide
into two completely separate parts?

08:20.303 --> 08:21.522
No idea.

08:21.547 --> 08:23.068
He's never been this out of control.

08:23.106 --> 08:24.538
He might be sick or something.

08:24.563 --> 08:26.942
Quit giving the villains
the benefit of the doubt.

08:29.446 --> 08:31.388
Can you create an electro-static pulse?

08:31.413 --> 08:33.940
To temporarily disengage
the sand molecules?

08:33.965 --> 08:35.980
I only have the power for one blast.

08:36.004 --> 08:38.207
But again, there's more
than one Subject S.

08:38.232 --> 08:40.568
Not if I can help it.
Wait for my signal.

08:41.897 --> 08:43.948
Let's hide and seek. Count to ten.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.698
Uh-huh. One, two,

08:46.733 --> 08:49.793
three, four, five...

08:54.590 --> 08:56.688
Aw, somebody needs a playmate.

09:01.682 --> 09:02.847
Iron Spider?

09:02.872 --> 09:05.008
This better be good, Spider-Man.

09:05.033 --> 09:06.564
<i>Just watch for my signal.</i>

09:09.508 --> 09:11.641
Ha! Found you!

09:11.666 --> 09:14.663
Oh, no, I should have picked a
better hiding place.

09:16.575 --> 09:18.381
Crush the spider!

09:18.416 --> 09:20.792
Tag the spider!

09:21.175 --> 09:22.281
Too slow!

09:26.124 --> 09:27.614
Do it now, Cho!

09:37.546 --> 09:38.719
He's only stunned.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.729
Now maybe we can figure out
what's wrong with him.

09:40.754 --> 09:42.275
- He needs help.
- Help?

09:42.300 --> 09:45.058
What part of "He's a bad
guy" are you not getting?

09:49.057 --> 09:51.265
That was a quick recovery, even for him.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.943
All four hims.

09:54.670 --> 09:57.136
Whoa. Talk about split-personality.

10:01.124 --> 10:03.639
Oh, this is disconcerting.

10:03.675 --> 10:07.180
It all makes sense to me.

10:07.657 --> 10:08.740
Ah!

10:09.305 --> 10:12.059
If only I could think of some
quip about "getting the point."

10:15.951 --> 10:17.649
I hate sharp objects.

10:21.513 --> 10:22.771
They won't stop.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.901
How have you destroyed
this virus before?

10:24.926 --> 10:27.393
This virus has a name. Flint Marko.

10:27.464 --> 10:29.260
But all these Sandmen are one-note.

10:29.285 --> 10:31.728
It's like they're facets
of the real Flint.

10:32.195 --> 10:34.026
- So where's the...
- Sandman Prime?

10:34.051 --> 10:36.244
We take down the Prime,
we take them all down.

10:39.259 --> 10:40.327
Ouch.

10:46.378 --> 10:47.485
That's peculiar.

10:47.510 --> 10:49.800
Lighthouses usually
aren't lead reinforced.

10:53.623 --> 10:55.737
Iron Spider, what are you doing?

10:55.843 --> 10:56.986
Whoa!

10:58.682 --> 11:00.825
This just keeps getting better.

11:08.049 --> 11:10.239
Spider-Man, this lighthouse?

11:10.491 --> 11:12.115
It's not a lighthouse.

11:19.475 --> 11:22.163
It's taking me down
to some kind of hidden base.

11:22.567 --> 11:23.906
Don't go down there alone.

11:23.940 --> 11:26.534
I think there's more going
on here than we realize.

11:30.572 --> 11:32.285
I know exactly what's going on.

11:32.310 --> 11:34.946
Sandman Prime's controlling
the attack from down here.

11:34.965 --> 11:36.738
And I'm going to decisively end it.

11:36.763 --> 11:38.801
I don't think Sandman's
in control of anything.

11:54.522 --> 11:56.998
I knew it. Evil secret base.

11:57.306 --> 11:58.282
Ahhh!

12:00.316 --> 12:03.712
Iron Spider, do not go into the base
alone. Do you hear me?

12:06.296 --> 12:09.086
Hey, I know something
none of you guys'll like.

12:13.094 --> 12:16.742
Water webs! Now your name's mud!
Comedy gold.

12:16.767 --> 12:18.599
<i>Iron Spider? Come in.</i>

12:18.624 --> 12:20.756
I hear you. Just not listening.

12:20.781 --> 12:23.669
Because as expected, I am right.

12:29.802 --> 12:31.103
Subject S,

12:31.128 --> 12:33.795
your control over your Sandmen
is brilliant,

12:36.131 --> 12:39.008
but your evil has to come to an end.

12:43.518 --> 12:44.579
Help me.

12:45.699 --> 12:46.530
Huh?

12:46.971 --> 12:48.206
Ahhh!

12:49.958 --> 12:51.794
Iron Spider, come in!

12:58.358 --> 12:59.503
You came back?

12:59.824 --> 13:01.332
I didn't think you'd
actually listen to me.

13:01.886 --> 13:03.576
Cho, what are you doing?

13:04.970 --> 13:07.164
Don't shoot! We're friends here.

13:09.308 --> 13:13.254
Seriously... Iron Spider.
This is totally out of hand.

13:13.279 --> 13:14.807
I... I know I've been
on your case today,

13:14.832 --> 13:16.524
but that's no reason to act like this.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.381
Oh, should have seen that coming.

13:31.767 --> 13:35.362
Don't bother, young man. You
are nothing without your armor.

13:35.387 --> 13:37.611
And soon you will be nothing at all.

13:37.912 --> 13:38.984
No.

13:39.850 --> 13:41.691
No!

13:48.066 --> 13:49.862
Enjoy your time together.

13:49.887 --> 13:54.508
After I witness Spider-Man's final
moments, I will be back to play with you.

13:55.905 --> 13:59.250
I'll show you who's nothing, Doc Ock.
You sub-intellect.

13:59.298 --> 14:00.942
Waste of time, kid.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.397
He's had me down here for weeks.

14:03.983 --> 14:06.248
Even in my sand form,
I can't find a way out.

14:06.917 --> 14:10.199
- Hands off, monster.
- Okay, okay. I get it.

14:10.683 --> 14:14.161
After all the stuff these mad scientist
types have had me pull over the years,

14:14.212 --> 14:16.330
I wouldn't wanna get
too close to me either.

14:17.446 --> 14:18.409
No.

14:18.945 --> 14:21.731
I'm... I'm just stressed
from, well...

14:22.013 --> 14:24.226
You, upstairs.

14:24.837 --> 14:26.941
It'll get worse
when Octavius gets back.

14:27.358 --> 14:30.602
That's when he starts experimenting.
On us.

14:30.627 --> 14:32.820
I'm not some freak like you.

14:33.107 --> 14:35.158
Ock doesn't see it that way.

14:35.343 --> 14:37.219
You're either with him or against him.

14:44.536 --> 14:46.372
No way this could get any worse.

14:51.399 --> 14:53.241
Well, I guess there is one way.

14:53.589 --> 14:55.754
You never struck me as
the beach type, Doc Ock.

14:55.868 --> 14:57.326
Do you own a pair of board shorts?

14:57.350 --> 15:00.942
Spider-Man, crawling right into my net.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.772
I lead a charmed life.

15:02.798 --> 15:03.912
What's the matter, Otto?

15:04.010 --> 15:06.225
Another Sinister Six
wasn't enough to beat me?

15:06.250 --> 15:07.684
You need a whole army now?

15:09.802 --> 15:13.081
This is not an army,
you insipid arachnid.

15:13.116 --> 15:15.271
I'm building the perfect team.

15:15.296 --> 15:18.531
One of these copies
will be the Ultimate Sandman

15:18.556 --> 15:20.744
for my Ultimate Sinister Six.

15:20.769 --> 15:22.105
That's what I love about you.

15:22.129 --> 15:25.792
Just when I think you've maxed
out the crazy, you crank it up to eleven.

15:25.818 --> 15:27.709
Could a crazy man have invented

15:27.734 --> 15:30.338
not only the means of creating
these splinter Sandmen,

15:30.363 --> 15:32.528
but also the means of controlling them?

15:37.395 --> 15:40.681
I'm gonna go with, "Yep, that's
exactly what a crazy man would do,"

15:40.716 --> 15:42.604
try to manipulate Sandman.

15:43.157 --> 15:44.695
Destroy him!

15:47.264 --> 15:49.529
Only you could make the beach not fun.

15:54.395 --> 15:56.926
I was so certain you were
controlling this whole thing.

15:57.408 --> 15:59.464
Spider-Man was right after all.

15:59.499 --> 16:03.687
Maybe if we work together, we can
come up with a way out of here.

16:03.712 --> 16:06.994
You're still a villain, Subject S.
I don't work with villains.

16:07.019 --> 16:09.720
Look. I've done some bad stuff.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.780
I have no one to blame but myself.

16:11.806 --> 16:13.721
But I am no villain.

16:14.224 --> 16:18.222
People always just, y'know,
use me for what I can do.

16:18.629 --> 16:20.275
They don't see past your powers?

16:20.300 --> 16:22.709
Right. I'm... I'm...
I'm not a person to them.

16:23.140 --> 16:26.179
Yeah, everybody I meet just
wants me to do brain tricks.

16:26.204 --> 16:28.322
"Solve this impossible
equation, Cho."

16:28.347 --> 16:30.756
"Calculate the Watcher's
body mass, Cho."

16:31.521 --> 16:34.888
Nobody ever wants to just hang
out or go bowling or something.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.531
I've never gone bowling.

16:41.047 --> 16:42.225
I see you guys have met.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.096
I love when my friends get along.

16:46.405 --> 16:48.606
So much for taking Sandman
down your way, huh?

16:48.631 --> 16:50.935
I've learned my lesson.
Now get us out.

16:53.134 --> 16:55.979
Okay, getting you
out just got a little harder.

16:59.562 --> 17:00.681
Yah!

17:01.595 --> 17:06.358
None of you are leaving here alive.
Destroy them! Destroy them all!

17:06.502 --> 17:08.640
You are a terrible host, Ock.

17:13.383 --> 17:16.222
I hate when I visit
someone in their secret lab...

17:18.234 --> 17:20.098
and they don't even offer you snacks.

17:21.843 --> 17:25.147
They just cut straight to trying
to destroy you with sand creatures.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.918
Cho, some help, please?

17:35.943 --> 17:37.469
There's no way out of here.

17:44.748 --> 17:45.385
Ahhh!

17:45.652 --> 17:47.311
You're a genius, remember?

17:47.336 --> 17:49.887
And you've got a man who can
change into any possible shape.

17:50.564 --> 17:52.051
You can do this.

17:54.145 --> 17:56.268
Whoa! The lock is sonically induced,

17:56.293 --> 17:58.555
which means the right resonant
frequency could...

17:58.813 --> 18:01.056
Flint, how much can you stretch?

18:07.612 --> 18:11.564
I was assembling my new Sinister
Six to bring you down, Spider-Man,

18:11.589 --> 18:14.862
but thanks to my sand army,
I may not need them.

18:21.540 --> 18:25.638
Now, why am I doing this?

18:25.663 --> 18:28.899
Because the second you vibrate this
cell at the right frequency...

18:30.873 --> 18:33.143
that happens. Time to go.

18:35.198 --> 18:36.017
Huh?

18:43.816 --> 18:45.100
You worked together?

18:45.125 --> 18:47.053
Aww, that would warm my heart...

18:48.152 --> 18:49.813
if we weren't about to be destroyed.

18:53.179 --> 18:56.302
Hey, Flint! Little help
with your, uh, self?

18:56.327 --> 18:57.871
Well, I can't control them.

18:57.896 --> 19:00.097
Not as long as Octavius has that thing.

19:01.251 --> 19:03.992
Remote access.
That's how he's deploying them.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.430
Then I know what to do.

19:05.540 --> 19:07.399
You're not the only genius on the team.

19:13.433 --> 19:15.842
One electromagnetic pulse coming up.

19:22.383 --> 19:25.638
No. No, you can't. Ahhh!

19:27.691 --> 19:28.894
Just did.

19:31.700 --> 19:34.274
Flint. Protect Cho. I'll get Otto.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.064
You'll get nothing!

19:36.153 --> 19:39.110
Activate Self-destruct
Sequence Octavius Alpha.

19:45.589 --> 19:47.266
The whole lab is coming down!

19:47.624 --> 19:49.578
Sick of this place anyway.

20:02.332 --> 20:03.675
Whew, we made it.

20:03.700 --> 20:06.190
That day at the beach
was no day at the beach.

20:08.985 --> 20:11.186
It's so hard to get sand
out of your suit.

20:12.347 --> 20:14.024
Ah, much better.

20:14.159 --> 20:15.367
That's how I feel.

20:15.618 --> 20:19.323
I've never been more in control
of my powers. I feel almost...

20:19.348 --> 20:21.045
- Normal?
- So stick around.

20:21.070 --> 20:22.942
We could make space for you
at S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy.

20:22.967 --> 20:26.126
Thanks, but I'm not ready
for group activities...

20:26.293 --> 20:27.156
yet.

20:27.624 --> 20:29.395
I think I just need some alone time.

20:29.420 --> 20:31.906
Well, if that's what you want,
I know just the spot.

20:34.004 --> 20:35.982
I always said
this place needed a beach.

20:36.188 --> 20:37.936
And nobody'll bug you here.

20:41.300 --> 20:44.990
Yeah, I think this looks like a place
I can really stretch out.

20:50.932 --> 20:53.786
And whenever you're ready, S.H.I.E.L.D.
Academy is right next door.

20:53.811 --> 20:56.116
I'll admit, you were right,
Spider-Man.

20:56.140 --> 20:58.789
Sometimes things aren't
as binary as I think they are.

20:59.067 --> 21:01.143
And not all bad guys are monsters.

21:01.168 --> 21:02.819
But I think you're right about Vulture.

21:02.976 --> 21:05.504
I played it soft, and he
dropped us right in Ock's lap.

21:05.529 --> 21:06.570
Or did he?

21:06.595 --> 21:09.141
Octavius was rather surprised to see us.

21:09.346 --> 21:11.694
You think Vulture
took us there to save Sandman?

21:12.256 --> 21:13.284
Like, on purpose?

21:13.309 --> 21:14.831
You did tell him you wanted to help.

21:14.967 --> 21:17.102
And he led us to someone
who really needed it.

21:17.136 --> 21:19.316
If there really is still
a person inside Vulture,

21:19.590 --> 21:21.397
we might have a shot
at stopping Ock's new team

21:21.422 --> 21:23.938
before he even gets started.
Let's get to work.

21:23.963 --> 21:25.710
Any chance you want
to go bowling first?

21:25.735 --> 21:27.780
Bowling? Are you okay, Cho?

21:27.790 --> 21:30.273
I'm expanding my parameters.

21:30.298 --> 21:31.966
Bowling it is, Spider Two.
