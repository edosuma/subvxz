00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.610 --> 00:12.378
<i> ¶ I was a girl in the village</i>
<i> Doing all right ¶</i>

00:12.380 --> 00:14.780
<i> ¶ Then I became</i>
<i> A princess overnight ¶</i>

00:14.782 --> 00:17.549
<i> ¶ Now I gotta figure out</i>
<i> How to do it right ¶</i>

00:17.551 --> 00:19.618
<i> ¶ So much to learn</i>
<i> And see ¶</i>

00:19.620 --> 00:22.454
<i> ¶ Up in the castle</i>
<i> With my new family ¶</i>

00:22.456 --> 00:25.157
<i> ¶ In a school that's</i>
<i> Just for royalty ¶</i>

00:25.159 --> 00:29.528
<i> ¶ A whole enchanted world</i>
<i> Is waiting for me ¶</i>

00:29.530 --> 00:32.965
<i> -¶ I'm so excited to be ¶</i>
<i> -¶ Sofia the first ¶</i>

00:32.967 --> 00:36.135
<i> ¶ I'm finding out what</i>
<i> Being royal's all about ¶</i>

00:36.137 --> 00:38.037
<i>¶ Sofia the first ¶</i>

00:38.039 --> 00:41.573
<i> ¶ Making my way</i>
<i> It's an adventure every day ¶</i>

00:41.575 --> 00:43.475
<i>¶ Sofia ¶</i>

00:43.477 --> 00:45.377
<i> -¶ It's gonna be my time ¶</i>
<i> -¶ Sofia ¶</i>

00:45.379 --> 00:51.984
<i> ¶ To show them all</i>
<i> That I'm Sofia the first ¶</i>

00:58.659 --> 01:02.327
[bell ringing]

01:02.329 --> 01:04.430
Class,
I have an announcement.

01:04.432 --> 01:07.900
Today is School Swap Day.

01:07.902 --> 01:10.402
The day when a student
from the village school

01:10.404 --> 01:13.505
and a student from Royal Prep
swap places.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.441
Why would we do that?

01:15.443 --> 01:18.544
So the village students can
learn more about you royals,

01:18.546 --> 01:21.346
and you royals can learn
more about them.

01:21.348 --> 01:23.115
Wait. Are you telling me,

01:23.117 --> 01:24.716
one of my friends
from my old school

01:24.718 --> 01:26.919
is coming here
for the whole day?

01:26.921 --> 01:28.687
Yes, I am!

01:28.689 --> 01:30.355
Jade?! A-mazing!

01:30.357 --> 01:33.392
Sofia!
Can you believe I'm here?

01:33.394 --> 01:36.095
We're back together again
just like old times!

01:36.097 --> 01:38.397
Since the two of you
know each other,

01:38.399 --> 01:41.233
Sofia, will you be
Jade's guide for the day?

01:41.235 --> 01:42.468
Will I?

01:42.470 --> 01:45.037
[chanting]
Like two birdies in a tree...

01:45.039 --> 01:47.239
-[snapping]
-...two friends are
the best to be.

01:47.241 --> 01:48.707
One plus one

01:48.709 --> 01:50.876
makes it twice as much fun!

01:50.878 --> 01:52.544
[laughing]

01:52.546 --> 01:54.046
Oh, my!

01:54.048 --> 01:57.416
Well, enjoy your classes
this morning, Jade.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.985
Then we'll all go
to Dunwiddie for lunch.

01:59.987 --> 02:02.621
And, later,
you can give a presentation

02:02.623 --> 02:04.423
on all you've learned

02:04.425 --> 02:08.627
when the Dunwiddie students
come here for a Royal Ball.

02:08.629 --> 02:09.895
Brilliant!

02:09.897 --> 02:11.930
[Flora]
Class is dismissed.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.566
Sofia, if I'm gonna
give a presentation,

02:14.568 --> 02:17.069
I better see everything
at Royal Prep.

02:17.071 --> 02:18.470
Then let's hurry.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.739
There's so much
to show you.

02:20.741 --> 02:23.308
And that's
our Enchanted Art room.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.644
And this is the Hall of Royals.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.746
Check this out, Sofia.

02:27.748 --> 02:30.349
I am Queen Jade.

02:30.351 --> 02:33.285
I, Queen Jade the Just,

02:33.287 --> 02:37.789
do hereby declare every Tuesday
to be Dazzleball Day.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.258
Hear, hear!

02:39.260 --> 02:42.628
Surrender, dragon,
or Prince Jade the Brave

02:42.630 --> 02:46.498
shall snuff out your flame
with yon dirty dishwater!

02:46.500 --> 02:49.535
[giggles] I miss going
to school with you, Jade.

02:49.537 --> 02:52.137
I wish you could come
to Royal Prep with me every day.

02:52.139 --> 02:53.705
Wouldn't that be great?

02:53.707 --> 02:56.842
Me, Princess Jade the...

02:56.844 --> 02:58.877
[gasps] Unbelievable.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.712
Jade the Unbelievable?

03:00.714 --> 03:02.748
That doesn't sound
quite right.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.952
No, Jade... look!

03:06.954 --> 03:09.655
You look just like the princess
in that old painting.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.356
You could be sisters.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.791
Who is she?

03:12.793 --> 03:16.028
It says
"Frederika Assemblia."

03:16.030 --> 03:19.665
I think I had
a Great-Great-Aunt Frederika.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.668
[Sofia] I'll bet you<i> are </i>
related to this princess!

03:24.538 --> 03:26.672
Ruby is gonna
want my autograph?

03:26.674 --> 03:28.640
If you're related
to a princess,

03:28.642 --> 03:30.576
then you
could<i> be</i> a princess.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.344
No way!

03:32.346 --> 03:34.146
And if you<i> are</i> a princess,

03:34.148 --> 03:38.217
then you can come with me
to Royal Prep every day!

03:38.219 --> 03:40.552
I'm a princess!

03:40.554 --> 03:43.021
School Swap
is the best day ever!

03:43.023 --> 03:44.723
[both laughing]

03:44.725 --> 03:47.226
I can't wait
to tell everyone!

03:47.228 --> 03:49.595
Ooh, ooh, wait.
I have an idea.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.163
Let's save it for lunch.

03:51.165 --> 03:53.765
That way we can tell
everyone at the same time,

03:53.767 --> 03:55.934
even our Dunwiddie friends.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.836
Great idea.

03:57.838 --> 04:01.240
So... ready to spend
our first official day
together at Royal Prep?

04:01.242 --> 04:02.841
Yes, I am!

04:02.843 --> 04:04.676
But is Royal Prep
ready for us?

04:04.678 --> 04:05.711
[bell clanging]

04:05.713 --> 04:06.712
By the way,

04:06.714 --> 04:08.080
which Royal do you think

04:08.082 --> 04:09.548
went to
the Dunwiddie School today?

04:09.550 --> 04:11.617
I don't know,

04:11.619 --> 04:13.585
but I'll bet
they're having just
as much fun as we are.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.788
It's School Swap Day, class.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.891
So please give
a big Dunwiddie School welcome

04:19.893 --> 04:23.695
to our royal guest,
Princess Amber.

04:23.697 --> 04:26.231
[class]
Welcome, Princess Amber!

04:26.233 --> 04:28.433
-[applause]
-Ah! Yes, yes. I know.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.902
I'm the biggest thing to hit
Dunwiddie Village since,

04:30.904 --> 04:33.605
well, the last time I visited
Dunwiddie Village.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.873
Where shall I sit?

04:34.875 --> 04:37.109
Right here, Amber.
I will be your guide.

04:37.111 --> 04:38.910
So if you need help,
just ask.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.812
Oh, thanks, Ruby,

04:40.814 --> 04:43.415
but I'm a star student
at Royal Prep,

04:43.417 --> 04:45.450
and I doubt I'll need any help.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.552
So, what class
do we have first,

04:47.554 --> 04:48.920
posture or tea-pouring?

04:48.922 --> 04:51.256
We'll start today
with science.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.625
Everyone take out
your rock collections.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.160
Rock collections?

04:55.162 --> 04:56.795
Don't you have rocks
at Royal Prep?

04:56.797 --> 04:58.730
Oh! Yes.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.233
I have rubies and diamonds
and sapphires...

05:01.235 --> 05:03.101
Uh, these are
a little different.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.671
We're going to learn
how to make metal objects

05:05.673 --> 05:07.673
float in mid-air.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.308
Oh, I know this.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.842
We did it at Royal Prep.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.844
Watch, she'll use
a magic wand.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.081
[class] Oooh!

05:16.083 --> 05:17.316
She didn't use a wand.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.350
We don't do magic here.

05:18.352 --> 05:19.951
This is science class.

05:19.953 --> 05:23.955
Rocks that act like magnets
are called lodestones.

05:23.957 --> 05:27.359
Now let's see how fast you can
find your lodestone.

05:27.361 --> 05:28.760
How about you, Amber?

05:28.762 --> 05:32.497
Uh, okay, Ms. Candoo.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.865
[Ruby]
Done! Hey, Amber.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.100
Found your lodestone yet?

05:35.102 --> 05:37.469
Oh. I'll just watch.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.237
Clearly,
my rocks are broken.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.707
[laughing]

05:41.709 --> 05:43.842
Well, I'm sure
the Dunwiddie student

05:43.844 --> 05:45.277
who is visiting Royal Prep

05:45.279 --> 05:47.179
is having just
as much trouble there.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.587
[clanging]

06:05.332 --> 06:06.898
You know what, Jade?

06:06.900 --> 06:09.668
Today's the best day
I've ever had at RPA.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.002
-[bell ringing]
-Mine, too!

06:11.004 --> 06:13.839
Of course, it's
my only day here so far.

06:13.841 --> 06:14.840
[giggles]

06:14.842 --> 06:16.475
Ready to go
to Dunwiddie for lunch?

06:16.477 --> 06:18.543
I can't wait
to announce our big news.

06:18.545 --> 06:19.544
Race you!

06:19.546 --> 06:21.213
[laughing]

06:21.215 --> 06:23.815
[applause]

06:23.817 --> 06:27.419
Welcome to all our dear friends
from Royal Prep.

06:27.421 --> 06:32.324
And thank you,
dear friends at Dunwiddie,
for hosting lunch.

06:32.326 --> 06:34.793
Now let's eat!

06:35.929 --> 06:36.995
And drink!

06:39.867 --> 06:41.600
[lemons tumbling]

06:47.775 --> 06:48.940
Hi, Sofia.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.410
Hey, nice gown, Jade.

06:51.412 --> 06:52.444
How's School Swap Day?

06:52.446 --> 06:53.945
Greater than great!

06:53.947 --> 06:56.581
I learned how to turn
a lime into an emerald.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.383
And we raced
in the flying derby.

06:58.385 --> 07:01.753
And we made this gown
with a magic paintbrush!

07:01.755 --> 07:03.121
Wow!

07:03.123 --> 07:04.790
What did you learn about
at Dunwiddie, Amber?

07:04.792 --> 07:05.924
Rocks.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.092
Amber, that's not true.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.794
You watched us
learn about rocks.

07:08.796 --> 07:11.029
You watched us
learn history,

07:11.031 --> 07:13.799
and you watched us
learn glass-blowing.

07:13.801 --> 07:16.802
[whispering]
She's not trying
anything at all.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.737
I'm starting to think
you're afraid.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.706
Afraid? Oh! Please!

07:21.708 --> 07:23.942
When I see something
I think I'll actually enjoy,

07:23.944 --> 07:25.944
I'll try it. For example,

07:25.946 --> 07:28.046
I'll now try
some of that lemonade.

07:28.048 --> 07:28.980
Excuse me.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.049
But, Amber, wait!

07:31.051 --> 07:32.884
You have to give a presentation
on what you learned later on!

07:32.886 --> 07:34.886
[sighs]
I don't think Amber's

07:34.888 --> 07:36.888
enjoying
School Swap Day very much.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.223
She'll be okay.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.792
Now, Jade, tell Ruby
what else you learned today.

07:40.794 --> 07:41.960
You tell her, Sofia.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.995
I still can't believe it.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.664
What?
Tell me what!

07:45.666 --> 07:48.834
We're almost positive Jade
is related to royalty!

07:48.836 --> 07:51.970
That means she can be
a student at Royal Prep
full-time!

07:51.972 --> 07:54.673
No way. That's amazing!

07:54.675 --> 07:56.808
Isn't it? We're gonna
make an announcement

07:56.810 --> 07:58.410
after everyone's
done eating.

07:58.412 --> 08:02.080
So now I have two best friends
who are princesses?

08:02.082 --> 08:03.315
Double amazing!

08:03.317 --> 08:05.116
Oh, there's Ms. Candoo.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.785
I haven't seen her in ages.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.286
I'm going to say hello.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.121
Jade, Royal Prep!

08:10.123 --> 08:11.957
Oh, you're gonna
have so much fun.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.091
I know.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.926
So then...

08:14.928 --> 08:17.996
you probably don't want
to eat with us, huh?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.931
Not when you can sit
with your new classmates.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.934
Oh. Uh... I don't know.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.803
I didn't
really think about that.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.271
It's okay, Jade.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.973
We'll sure miss seeing you
every day at school,

08:27.975 --> 08:30.709
but everyone's gonna
be really excited for you.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.777
Me included.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.379
Thanks. I...

08:34.381 --> 08:35.714
See you later...

08:35.716 --> 08:38.517
Princess Jade.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.819
[lemonade maker clicking
and pouring]

08:40.821 --> 08:42.521
But...

08:42.523 --> 08:45.490
I'm going to miss seeing
all of them every day too.

08:45.492 --> 08:48.660
Oh, no. Maybe leaving here
to go to Royal Prep

08:48.662 --> 08:49.961
is a big mistake.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.030
[drum roll and fanfare]

08:52.032 --> 08:53.231
All right, everyone.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.966
Let's welcome our guests...

08:54.968 --> 08:56.968
the Dunwiddie way!

08:56.970 --> 08:59.004
<i> ¶ Go Dunwiddie ¶</i>

08:59.006 --> 09:00.472
<i> ¶ Go Dunwiddie ¶</i>

09:00.474 --> 09:03.675
<i> ¶ Hail the green and brown ¶</i>

09:03.677 --> 09:06.811
<i> ¶ Everyone cheer</i>
<i> For the school right here ¶</i>

09:06.813 --> 09:10.181
<i> ¶ In old Dunwiddie Town ¶</i>

09:10.183 --> 09:12.017
<i> ¶ Go Dunwiddie ¶</i>

09:12.019 --> 09:13.485
<i> ¶ Oh Dunwiddie ¶</i>

09:13.487 --> 09:16.421
<i> ¶ No matter how far we roam ¶</i>

09:16.423 --> 09:19.357
<i> ¶ We'll have</i>
<i> Friends till the end ¶</i>

09:19.359 --> 09:21.359
<i> ¶ From old Dunwiddie ¶</i>

09:21.361 --> 09:25.664
<i> ¶ Our school our home ¶</i>

09:25.666 --> 09:26.765
Hey!

09:26.767 --> 09:28.233
Great song, Dunwiddie!

09:28.235 --> 09:30.735
Here's how
we say hello at RPA.

09:32.239 --> 09:35.440
<i> ¶ Huzzah huzzah</i>
<i> For Royal Prep ¶</i>

09:35.442 --> 09:38.944
<i> ¶ For the red</i>
<i> And green and blue ¶</i>

09:38.946 --> 09:40.178
<i> ¶ We're all for one ¶</i>

09:40.180 --> 09:42.080
<i> ¶ And one for all ¶</i>

09:42.082 --> 09:45.183
<i> ¶ At RPA you'll hear</i>
<i> Our royal call ¶</i>

09:45.185 --> 09:47.052
<i> -¶ Huzzah huzzah ¶</i>
<i> -¶ Go Dunwiddie ¶</i>

09:47.054 --> 09:49.020
<i> -¶ For Royal Prep ¶</i>
<i> -¶ Oh Dunwiddie ¶</i>

09:49.022 --> 09:50.021
<i> ¶ Yes we're loyal</i>
<i> through and through ¶</i>

09:50.023 --> 09:51.356
<i> ¶ No matter how far we roam ¶</i>

09:51.358 --> 09:53.358
<i> ¶ We rule on the field ¶</i>

09:53.360 --> 09:55.293
<i> ¶ And off it too ¶</i>

09:55.295 --> 09:58.630
<i> ¶ 'Cause at Royal Prep</i>
<i> To our team we're true ¶</i>

09:58.632 --> 09:59.764
<i> ¶ Dunwiddie! ¶</i>

09:59.766 --> 10:01.600
<i> ¶ Huzzah! ¶</i>

10:01.602 --> 10:03.868
<i> -¶ Yes, at Royal Prep ¶</i>
<i> - ¶ Old Dunwiddie ¶</i>

10:03.870 --> 10:08.039
<i> -¶ To our team we're true</i>
<i> -¶ Our school our home ¶</i>

10:08.041 --> 10:09.140
Go, Dunwiddie!

10:09.142 --> 10:09.975
Huzzah!

10:11.979 --> 10:14.045
[somber music playing]

10:19.219 --> 10:20.885
<i> ¶ Oh Dunwiddie ¶</i>

10:20.887 --> 10:22.721
<i> ¶ No Dunwiddie ¶</i>

10:22.723 --> 10:26.424
<i> ¶ How I'd miss this school ¶</i>

10:26.426 --> 10:30.562
<i> ¶ To leave behind</i>
<i> These friends of mine ¶</i>

10:30.564 --> 10:35.100
<i> ¶ For a gown and jewels ¶</i>

10:35.102 --> 10:38.236
<i> ¶ Old Dunwiddie ¶</i>

10:38.238 --> 10:40.772
<i> ¶ Dear Dunwiddie ¶</i>

10:40.774 --> 10:45.010
<i> ¶ I sure don't want to part ¶</i>

10:45.012 --> 10:50.148
<i> ¶ But I know if I stay ¶</i>

10:50.150 --> 10:53.752
<i> ¶ That would break ¶</i>

10:53.754 --> 10:59.024
<i> ¶ Sofia's heart ¶</i>

11:08.201 --> 11:11.102
[students laughing
and conversing]

11:11.104 --> 11:14.205
Ruby, I need your help.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.707
What's wrong?

11:15.709 --> 11:17.208
I don't think
I want to go to Royal Prep.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.309
Are you kidding?

11:18.311 --> 11:19.878
You'll learn magic
and wear jewels

11:19.880 --> 11:21.646
and spend all your time
with the royals and--

11:21.648 --> 11:26.151
Yeah, but I'd rather spend time
with all my friends here.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.453
I mean, the way
we all go down to the stream

11:28.455 --> 11:30.488
to skip stones during recess.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.290
What's better than that?

11:32.292 --> 11:34.693
Okay. So don't go to Royal Prep
if you don't want to.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.294
Just tell Sofia.

11:36.296 --> 11:39.197
But she's really excited
about me going to her school.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.399
I'm afraid
I'll hurt her feelings.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.468
She's your friend.
She'll understand.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.370
But...
what if she doesn't?

11:45.372 --> 11:46.638
[Sofia] Jade!

11:46.640 --> 11:49.207
So I just had
the best idea.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.210
Sofia, Jade has
something to tell you, too.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.244
What is it?

11:53.246 --> 11:54.312
Is something wrong?

11:54.314 --> 11:55.313
Uh, no.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.215
I mean, sort of.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.184
You know you can tell me
anything, right?

11:59.186 --> 12:01.019
And now that we're
going to school together,

12:01.021 --> 12:03.221
we'll have even
more heart-to-heart talks!

12:03.223 --> 12:04.856
So what's the matter?

12:04.858 --> 12:06.091
Well, I...

12:06.093 --> 12:07.258
um...

12:07.260 --> 12:09.094
I'm really thirsty.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.361
Can I have your lemonade?

12:10.363 --> 12:12.897
Oh, sure.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.232
[slurping]

12:15.736 --> 12:16.935
Is that it?

12:16.937 --> 12:18.503
Ahh!

12:19.773 --> 12:21.906
I bet you're nervous
about all this.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.742
I was
when I was new to RPA.

12:23.744 --> 12:27.178
But that's why the idea
I just had is so perfect.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.214
I know we decided to announce
the news at lunch,

12:29.216 --> 12:31.116
but now
I think we should wait.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.517
Yes!

12:32.519 --> 12:35.520
And tell everyone
at tonight's Royal Ball!

12:35.522 --> 12:36.521
What?!

12:36.523 --> 12:38.289
It was at my first ball

12:38.291 --> 12:40.425
that I really started
to feel like a princess.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.861
So I thought it could be
the same for you.

12:42.863 --> 12:46.297
Oh, that's
really not necessary.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.066
Of course it is.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.468
I'd do anything to make
you feel at home at RPA.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.936
What are best friends for?

12:51.938 --> 12:53.938
What can I say?

12:53.940 --> 12:55.106
You can say yes!

12:55.108 --> 12:56.241
Yes?

12:56.243 --> 12:58.376
Yes!
It's really happening!

12:58.378 --> 12:59.744
All right, everyone,

12:59.746 --> 13:01.212
back to class.

13:04.151 --> 13:07.252
I hope you enjoyed lunch
with everyone from RPA.

13:07.254 --> 13:10.622
Now, are you ready
for our afternoon class?

13:10.624 --> 13:12.390
Dancing? Royal waving?

13:12.392 --> 13:13.925
Anything I'm good at.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.960
-Architecture!
-Oh!

13:15.962 --> 13:19.330
Yesterday, you all designed
a climb-nasium.

13:19.332 --> 13:22.000
Today, you're going to build it.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.835
Think you can handle
this challenge?

13:23.837 --> 13:26.404
[class]
Can do, Ms. Candoo!

13:26.406 --> 13:28.306
Wow. That is really loud.

13:36.349 --> 13:39.017
Hey, Amber, want to help me
build my climb-nasium?

13:39.019 --> 13:41.186
Oh, I'll just watch.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.988
No. This time,
you have to join us.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.423
It's our last class
of the day.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.926
Oh! You know, I would,

13:47.928 --> 13:51.796
but, uh, oh! I'm not wearing
my building dress.

13:51.798 --> 13:54.232
Wear a smock.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.335
Oh, darn!

13:57.337 --> 13:59.971
I don't have
my tool belt thingy.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.407
Use mine.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.210
Ruby, the truth is,

14:05.212 --> 14:07.312
I never learned to build stuff
at Royal Prep.

14:07.314 --> 14:08.813
So?

14:08.815 --> 14:11.816
So... I can curtsey
28 different ways,

14:11.818 --> 14:15.220
but I don't know anything
about rocks or blowing glass,

14:15.222 --> 14:17.455
and I can't tell one end
of this hammer from the other.

14:17.457 --> 14:18.489
It's a wrench.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.225
Oh! See what I mean?

14:20.227 --> 14:21.993
This place just isn't for me.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.394
Look, I know it's different

14:23.396 --> 14:25.563
than what you're used to
at your school.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.233
But what we do at Dunwiddie
is pretty great, too.

14:28.235 --> 14:29.667
Why not just give it a try?

14:29.669 --> 14:32.637
[hammers pounding]

14:32.639 --> 14:35.240
But what if
I'm no good at it?

14:35.242 --> 14:38.042
What if I make a mistake
and everyone laughs at me?

14:38.044 --> 14:40.845
Or what
if you're great at it?

14:40.847 --> 14:43.815
What if, maybe,
you even enjoy it?

14:43.817 --> 14:46.417
C'mon, Amber.
Try it.

14:46.419 --> 14:47.685
If anyone laughs at you,

14:47.687 --> 14:49.387
they'll have
to answer to me.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.489
Oh. Okay.

14:51.491 --> 14:52.757
Hand me that screwdriver.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.092
-Wrench.
-Wrench.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.327
Right. I knew that.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.329
[music playing]

15:26.126 --> 15:28.326
Great work, Amber!
We're done!

15:31.064 --> 15:32.130
-[dress tears]
-Oh!

15:32.132 --> 15:33.731
Oh, no, your gown!

15:33.733 --> 15:35.300
We keep
an extra dress here...

15:35.302 --> 15:37.201
for emergencies
just like this.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.636
Oh.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.271
Well, there's
more to life than fashion.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.206
I cannot believe
I just said that.

15:42.208 --> 15:44.208
Anyway, I'll be right back.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.380
[Flora]
<i> I welcome you all,</i>

15:49.382 --> 15:52.550
to the School Swap Day
Royal Ball.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.919
We'll have dancing and song

15:54.921 --> 15:57.088
and also
a short presentation

15:57.090 --> 15:59.824
from each of
our two school swapees.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.659
But before we begin,

16:01.661 --> 16:05.063
please take a moment to talk
to someone you don't know.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.265
Because the thing
about royals...

16:07.267 --> 16:09.467
And villagers is...

16:09.469 --> 16:12.403
[both] Together,
you make up a kingdom!

16:14.507 --> 16:17.342
Hello, we're coming over
to talk to you,

16:17.344 --> 16:19.143
because we don't know you.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.746
Hildegard, it's me.

16:21.748 --> 16:25.083
Amber?! What did they do
to you at that school?

16:25.085 --> 16:26.451
They taught me this.

16:26.453 --> 16:30.488
[gasps] How are you doing that
without a wand?

16:30.490 --> 16:32.523
I can do
a lot more than that.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.926
But you'll have to wait
for my presentation
to see more.

16:34.928 --> 16:37.161
So, I'll ask if I can make
our announcement

16:37.163 --> 16:38.596
before the presentations.

16:38.598 --> 16:42.133
Then I'll introduce you
and open the curtain

16:42.135 --> 16:43.768
and you'll
pull off the sheet.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.170
Everyone will see
you look just like the portrait,

16:46.172 --> 16:48.606
and they'll realize
you're royalty.

16:48.608 --> 16:49.374
Uh-huh.

16:49.376 --> 16:50.975
You seem distracted.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.610
Are you still nervous?

16:52.612 --> 16:54.479
Uh, no, no.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.614
There's a stream back there.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.350
It reminds me of the stream
by the Dunwiddie school

16:59.352 --> 17:00.885
where we used to skip stones.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.120
Remember?

17:02.122 --> 17:03.688
We have stones
at this stream, too.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.656
Tomorrow I'll show you
where the magic ones are.

17:05.658 --> 17:08.459
They just skip
and skip forever.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.228
Oh, great.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.697
Jade, are you sure
you're okay?

17:12.699 --> 17:14.499
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

17:14.501 --> 17:16.334
Actually, Sofia,

17:16.336 --> 17:18.503
this isn't easy
for me, but...

17:18.505 --> 17:20.071
What's that?

17:20.073 --> 17:22.040
Just something
I thought you'd like.

17:22.042 --> 17:24.208
My own tiara?

17:24.210 --> 17:26.577
It's just like the one I wore
at my first ball.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.212
It's beautiful.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.914
It's yours.

17:29.916 --> 17:33.217
So you'll always know
I'm right here beside you.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.652
I crown you...

17:34.654 --> 17:36.687
Princess Jade.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.223
So what were you
about to tell me?

17:39.225 --> 17:40.258
I...

17:40.260 --> 17:41.492
Nothing.

17:41.494 --> 17:42.827
Don't worry, Jade.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.495
You're going out there,
a village girl

17:44.497 --> 17:47.465
but you're coming back
a princess.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.603
Miss Flora,
may I make an announcement?

17:52.605 --> 17:55.239
Well...
I guess it's all right.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.507
Excuse me, everyone!

17:56.509 --> 17:58.109
While Jade was here,

17:58.111 --> 18:00.845
she and I made
an amazing discovery.

18:00.847 --> 18:03.948
We found a new princess!

18:03.950 --> 18:07.552
And soon she'll be starting
at Royal Prep.

18:07.554 --> 18:08.719
A new princess?

18:08.721 --> 18:10.521
Why wasn't I notified?

18:10.523 --> 18:15.526
Without further ado,
may I present, Princess...

18:15.528 --> 18:17.628
Huh? Where is she?

18:17.630 --> 18:20.064
I knew there
couldn't be a princess
I'd never heard of.

18:20.066 --> 18:22.733
Um... you'll all meet her
in a minute.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.602
Right after...

18:24.604 --> 18:27.472
Amber shows you what
she learned at Dunwiddie today.

18:27.474 --> 18:30.708
My turn? Can do!

18:30.710 --> 18:35.546
So, the first thing I learned
is how to make a wrench float

18:35.548 --> 18:38.316
without using a magic wand.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.884
-Whoa! Impressive!
-Ooh!

18:39.886 --> 18:41.819
You haven't seen anything yet.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.121
Jade!

18:43.123 --> 18:45.456
[sighs] Where could she be?

18:45.458 --> 18:46.891
Wait. I know.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.566
[Sofia] Jade?

18:55.568 --> 18:57.401
Oh, hey, Sofia.

18:57.403 --> 18:58.503
You were right.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.571
These stones
do skip forever.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.475
Why did you leave?

19:04.477 --> 19:06.644
I... can't tell you.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.646
Your feelings'll get hurt.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.348
Jade, they won't.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.582
Okay.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.951
[deep breath]

19:13.953 --> 19:17.255
I'm sorry, but I don't
want to go to Royal Prep.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.623
-What?!
-See?

19:18.625 --> 19:20.358
I hurt your feelings.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.026
I just don't understand.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.628
Why not?

19:23.630 --> 19:26.197
I had a great time
with you today, Sofia.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.766
But if I came here,

19:28.768 --> 19:31.636
I would miss all my friends
from the Dunwiddie School.

19:31.638 --> 19:34.038
Oh. I didn't think of that.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.607
Mm, I knew
I shouldn't have told you.

19:36.609 --> 19:37.975
Jade, wait a minute.

19:37.977 --> 19:41.779
Okay, I am disappointed.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.614
But only
because I realized today

19:43.616 --> 19:45.683
how much I missed going
to school with you.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.219
But I want you to be happy.

19:48.221 --> 19:49.787
I'm glad you told me.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.556
You do? Phew!

19:51.558 --> 19:53.224
'Cause it was hard!

19:53.226 --> 19:55.359
I'm sorry if I made it hard
for you to tell me.

19:55.361 --> 19:59.130
You know,
it wasn't easy when you
went away to Royal Prep,

19:59.132 --> 20:01.365
but I got used to it.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.801
I just don't think I could
get used to being apart

20:03.803 --> 20:05.469
from all
my other friends now.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.338
I understand.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.240
You don't have
to go to Royal Prep
if you don't want to.

20:09.242 --> 20:11.209
I don't?

20:11.211 --> 20:13.744
No. We'll just keep
that portrait a secret.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.746
Oh, no! The portrait!

20:15.748 --> 20:17.815
They all heard you
announce the new princess!

20:17.817 --> 20:20.218
Any minute, someone'll
pull off that sheet

20:20.220 --> 20:22.720
and see the portrait
looks just like me!

20:22.722 --> 20:24.388
Not if we get there first!

20:25.992 --> 20:28.392
So here's what else I learned.

20:28.394 --> 20:31.729
The bigger the stone,
the more magnetic it is.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.532
Watch-- a metal bowl.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.734
A metal serving tray.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.169
And finally...

20:39.405 --> 20:42.173
a suit of armor!

20:42.175 --> 20:43.908
Whoa!

20:43.910 --> 20:44.909
Ooh!

20:44.911 --> 20:46.244
Oh!

20:46.246 --> 20:48.246
It's the metal
in my tool belt.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.047
I'll just reach down
and unfasten...

20:50.049 --> 20:52.416
Oh! Whoa!
No need to worry!

20:52.418 --> 20:55.419
This kind of thing happens
when you try something new.

20:55.421 --> 20:56.787
Hey! Sofia's back!

20:56.789 --> 20:58.222
Oh... whoa!

20:58.224 --> 20:59.957
So where
is this new princess?

20:59.959 --> 21:01.225
I'm sorry, everyone.

21:01.227 --> 21:03.894
But there is
no new princess.

21:03.896 --> 21:06.697
Yeah, we made a mistake.

21:06.699 --> 21:09.767
Oh! If I can
just steady myself by...

21:09.769 --> 21:10.901
Unh!

21:10.903 --> 21:12.870
Oh, no!

21:14.707 --> 21:17.541
Jade looks
just like that royal portrait.

21:17.543 --> 21:18.743
They must be related.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.211
So, Jade is a...

21:20.213 --> 21:21.712
Princess.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.881
Jade is
the new princess!

21:23.883 --> 21:25.082
Oh! I feel faint.

21:25.084 --> 21:26.450
Me, too.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.819
Can someone get me down?

21:28.821 --> 21:31.789
[groaning]

21:32.992 --> 21:34.458
-[buckle clicks]
-Oh!

21:34.460 --> 21:36.994
-I'm okay! Mostly.
-[applause]

21:36.996 --> 21:39.263
So Jade is coming
to Royal Prep now?

21:39.265 --> 21:41.232
Boom goes the cannon!

21:41.234 --> 21:43.901
No, Jade won't
be coming here.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.002
Tell them, Jade.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.170
Tell them the truth.

21:46.172 --> 21:47.672
[sighs]

21:47.674 --> 21:49.974
Uh, the truth is...

21:49.976 --> 21:52.076
I want to go to Dunwiddie,

21:52.078 --> 21:53.911
because that's
where my friends are.

21:53.913 --> 21:54.979
Most of them.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.814
Is that okay?

21:56.816 --> 21:58.649
I'm sorry, Jade.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.685
I'm afraid
there's nothing to be done.

22:00.687 --> 22:03.688
Yes. There
is nothing to be done,

22:03.690 --> 22:06.290
because
you're not a princess.

22:06.292 --> 22:07.591
She's not?

22:07.593 --> 22:10.328
The lady in that portrait
is not royal.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.129
She's Frederika Assemblia,

22:12.131 --> 22:14.832
the original architect
of Royal Prep.

22:14.834 --> 22:18.869
She designed
this whole school
many years ago.

22:18.871 --> 22:21.772
That's why we keep her painting
in the Hall of Royals.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.307
To honor her.

22:23.309 --> 22:24.775
You know, Jade,

22:24.777 --> 22:27.778
she learned to be an architect
at the Dunwiddie School.

22:27.780 --> 22:32.350
So... I'm just regular old Jade
from Dunwiddie again?

22:32.352 --> 22:33.851
Yes, dear.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.720
You are indeed.

22:35.722 --> 22:36.721
Whoo-hoo!

22:36.723 --> 22:38.723
[laughs] Sorry!

22:38.725 --> 22:41.692
I'm just really happy
not to be royal.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.794
Wait. What?

22:43.796 --> 22:46.897
And we're really happy
to have you back at Dunwiddie.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.232
Ooh. Still...

22:48.234 --> 22:49.867
a little dizzy.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.235
You'll be okay, Amber.

22:51.237 --> 22:53.671
We just need to get you
back into a royal gown.

22:53.673 --> 22:55.973
It was fun
to try something new,

22:55.975 --> 22:58.142
but it's good to be home.

22:58.144 --> 23:00.711
Well, Jade,
there's one thing I know.

23:00.713 --> 23:04.715
Wherever you go to school,
you will always be my friend.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.651
And you will always
be my friend, Sofia.

23:09.922 --> 23:12.223
[chanting]
Like two birdies in a tree,

23:12.225 --> 23:14.358
two friends
are the best to be.

23:14.360 --> 23:18.262
One plus one makes it
twice as much fun!

23:20.933 --> 23:24.402
