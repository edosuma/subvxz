WEBVTT

01:10.705 --> 01:15.459
Promise that you're not going to fuck
any Italians, babe.

01:15.585 --> 01:17.003
Why are you saying that?

01:18.046 --> 01:21.257
- Or some gringo backpacker?
- No, it's disgusting!

01:22.050 --> 01:24.051
Maybe a French homo?

01:24.261 --> 01:25.636
No!

01:25.762 --> 01:31.183
How about a dirty Mexican
selling bracelets in the French Riviera?

01:31.309 --> 01:32.393
Tenoch!

01:32.519 --> 01:35.812
- With nobody.
- Of course not.

01:37.482 --> 01:39.858
- Promise me.
- I promise.

01:39.985 --> 01:41.735
- What?
- Come on, you know!

01:41.861 --> 01:43.320
Know what?

01:46.074 --> 01:47.366
I promise...

01:47.492 --> 01:50.036
that I won't even sleep...

01:50.162 --> 01:51.245
with a Chinese.

01:51.371 --> 01:54.206
- I'm not joking!
- Don't you trust me, Tenoch?

01:54.332 --> 01:57.293
- Yes.
- So what?

01:59.254 --> 02:03.049
- Well, promise.
- And you?

02:03.175 --> 02:04.800
I promise, too.

02:04.926 --> 02:06.385
Let's hear it.

02:06.511 --> 02:09.180
- But we'll do it together.
- Together.

02:11.099 --> 02:15.311
One... two... three.

02:16.479 --> 02:19.356
I promise that I...

02:19.482 --> 02:22.151
won't fuck...

02:22.902 --> 02:26.238
- any Brazilian.
- Any German.

02:26.364 --> 02:27.864
- Argentinean.
- Polish.

02:27.991 --> 02:29.325
- Venezuelans.
- Irish.

02:29.451 --> 02:31.452
- Or from Guasave.
- Your father.

02:32.204 --> 02:34.038
Are you mad?

02:46.051 --> 02:49.095
Ana's mother, a divorced
French woman, a teacher...

02:49.221 --> 02:51.055
at the Foreigners Institute...

02:51.181 --> 02:54.225
didn't object about Tenoch
sleeping with her daughter.

02:56.019 --> 02:57.769
It was different for Julio.

02:57.895 --> 02:59.855
He could stay with Cecilia
only until dinner...

02:59.982 --> 03:04.360
and had to come back in the morning
for the trip to the airport.

03:06.363 --> 03:10.866
Although he didn't show it, Cecilia's father,
a paediatrician specialising in allergies...

03:10.993 --> 03:15.287
thought his daughter's relationship
with Julio had gone too far.

03:17.040 --> 03:20.626
Her mother, a Lacanian psychologist,
saw it differently.

03:20.752 --> 03:23.129
She believed their relationship
was innocent.

03:23.255 --> 03:27.299
- She can't find her passport!
- Then she's going to miss the plane!

03:27.425 --> 03:30.970
Julio!
Help me look for the passport!

03:31.096 --> 03:34.390
- Quick, we're in a hurry!
- Yes, yes.

03:37.477 --> 03:39.478
Did you take the car out?

03:40.188 --> 03:42.398
- Shut the door!
- And the passport?

03:42.524 --> 03:44.316
It's here, stupid.

03:44.442 --> 03:45.317
Come on, babe!

03:45.944 --> 03:48.029
Hurry.

03:59.916 --> 04:01.583
- What a nice goodbye.
- Oh, yeah!

04:05.297 --> 04:08.382
What are you going out tonight?

04:08.508 --> 04:11.302
No, I'll be missing you too much, babe.

04:11.428 --> 04:14.305
I know I'm going to miss you an awful lot.

04:14.973 --> 04:17.349
- Come on!
- Cecilia!

04:17.475 --> 04:19.517
- Your mother!
- Come, come!

04:19.644 --> 04:22.479
I want to take a bit of you inside me.

04:23.565 --> 04:25.857
The plane won't wait for you, darling!

04:25.984 --> 04:27.818
Move! Move!

04:32.991 --> 04:34.241
Did you find your passport?

04:34.367 --> 04:36.743
- Here it is!
- Good.

04:39.164 --> 04:42.458
Hello! How are you?

04:42.584 --> 04:45.836
- Have you seen Esteban?
- No, I haven't.

04:47.339 --> 04:48.922
Ana, let's do the check-in!

04:54.596 --> 04:56.180
What's up, charolastra?

04:56.306 --> 05:01.227
- I hate this farewell bullshit?
- Why don't they just go.

05:01.353 --> 05:04.355
I'm going to miss her,
but this is too much. Bye bye.

05:04.481 --> 05:07.566
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, how's it going?

05:07.692 --> 05:09.235
Why are you so pale?

05:09.361 --> 05:10.569
Never mind.

05:12.155 --> 05:14.615
- Princess.
- Hi, dad! How are you?

05:16.952 --> 05:20.537
Ana's father was a journalist
who had recently become a politician.

05:21.456 --> 05:27.169
He was the Director of Logistics at the
Department of Culture in Mexico City.

05:27.295 --> 05:31.673
Although he had a liking for Tenoch,
he referred to him as the "Preppie"

05:31.799 --> 05:36.053
in front of his colleagues,
but never in front of Ana.

05:36.179 --> 05:39.390
- Let's go.
- I wish I was already there.

05:39.516 --> 05:43.269
- Don't go.
- I'll miss you so much.

05:43.395 --> 05:45.896
- I don't want to leave, sweetie.
- Ana!

05:55.907 --> 05:56.991
Smell of bread.

05:59.286 --> 06:02.454
You pig!
Get the hell off!

06:02.580 --> 06:06.125
A graduation gift.

06:06.251 --> 06:09.295
You should have failed!

06:09.421 --> 06:12.089
Stop it.
Don't be a baby.

06:13.008 --> 06:16.593
- Did your old man get pissed off?
- He lost it.

06:16.719 --> 06:21.015
If I don't take Economics,
I can forget the car.

06:21.141 --> 06:23.642
You'd give up our car...

06:23.768 --> 06:28.480
- because of a fucking course?
- I hate economists!

06:28.606 --> 06:32.151
They can all go and fuck themselves.

06:32.277 --> 06:34.320
- You're an idiot.
- No way.

06:34.446 --> 06:38.115
I want to be a writer.
Switch to Literature with me, man.

06:38.241 --> 06:40.159
No way.

06:44.206 --> 06:49.668
Fucking traffic! I bet my sister's
in another demonstration.

06:49.794 --> 06:52.046
It's their right, charolastra.

06:52.172 --> 06:56.508
And it's my right to tell them
to fuck off.

06:56.634 --> 06:58.302
I suppose so.

06:58.428 --> 07:04.350
- But left-wing chicks are hot, mate.
- Totally.

07:05.435 --> 07:07.561
Are you wearing perfume?

07:11.149 --> 07:14.485
Holy shit!
You fucking pig!

07:14.611 --> 07:15.444
Open it!

07:15.570 --> 07:17.571
- Open it!
- It's locked.

07:17.697 --> 07:19.573
Open it, arsehole!

07:20.825 --> 07:24.661
On that day, three demonstrations
took place across the city.

07:25.538 --> 07:29.875
But the traffic jam was caused
by a pedestrian.

07:30.668 --> 07:33.837
Marcelino Escutia,
a bricklayer from Michoacan.

07:35.215 --> 07:39.218
Marcelino was hit by a speeding bus.

07:40.387 --> 07:42.263
He never used the pedestrian bridge...

07:42.389 --> 07:47.684
because its poor location forced him to walk
three extra miles to his work site.

07:48.811 --> 07:51.605
His unidentified body
was collected by the Red Cross...

07:51.731 --> 07:54.108
and taken to the city morgue.

07:55.193 --> 07:57.361
It took four days for the corpse
to be claimed.

08:03.118 --> 08:05.577
Tenoch Iturbide was the second
of three children...

08:05.703 --> 08:10.332
born to a Harvard trained economist,
Secretary of State...

08:10.458 --> 08:15.254
and a housewife who attended
various spiritual seminars.

08:16.423 --> 08:20.342
His parents considered
naming him Hernán...

08:20.468 --> 08:23.429
but he was born the year his father
joined the ruling party...

08:23.555 --> 08:25.889
and affected by a sudden nationalism...

08:26.141 --> 08:28.392
he opted to give his son
an Aztec name: Tenoch.

08:29.394 --> 08:32.313
Once we're stoned, we'll drop a little E.

08:32.438 --> 08:35.274
I've brought some stuff from
San Francisco. Good stuff!

08:35.400 --> 08:36.650
Really?

08:36.775 --> 08:39.403
Total organic shit!

08:42.490 --> 08:46.493
If Miriam comes,
I'll slip it into her sweet little thing...

08:48.163 --> 08:49.913
- What a babe!
- Yeah!

08:50.165 --> 08:54.793
At the party she was walking around
rubbing her arse against me.

08:56.504 --> 08:58.672
Truth is, she's a bit of a slut.

09:00.217 --> 09:02.134
The one I want to screw is Shorty's chick.

09:02.260 --> 09:03.844
She's got these little tits...

09:06.932 --> 09:09.266
She's a stunner.

09:10.310 --> 09:13.395
Not here, arsehole.
Let's go to the terrace!

09:13.521 --> 09:16.523
- The smell is the same.
- It stinks, mate!

09:22.905 --> 09:25.491
- Nice, isn't it?
- Don't be an arsehole.

09:26.826 --> 09:28.702
- Dry.
- Of course.

09:30.205 --> 09:31.538
Monkey stuff.

09:31.664 --> 09:33.540
A strong joint.

09:34.626 --> 09:35.584
Tenoch!

09:35.710 --> 09:37.419
My mother.

09:37.545 --> 09:40.381
- Hello, madam. How are you?
- Hi, Julio.

09:40.507 --> 09:42.716
- Hi, mum.
- Hello, sweetheart.

09:43.593 --> 09:46.303
What's going on?
You seem strange.

09:47.639 --> 09:50.641
Are you sad?
Must be your girlfriends.

09:52.769 --> 09:56.397
Come on, boys.
They're not really gone.

09:56.523 --> 09:58.774
Think of them, and you'll be with them.

10:00.277 --> 10:03.487
- Are you coming to Jessica's wedding?
- Of course! I wouldn't miss it.

10:04.656 --> 10:08.784
You have to dress up, all right?
The President is coming.

10:08.910 --> 10:10.244
Get rid of that cigarette, Tenoch.

10:11.663 --> 10:15.457
Good evening, madam.
Your garden totally rules.

10:15.583 --> 10:19.003
- I didn't know you were here, Saba.
- I'm everywhere.

10:23.341 --> 10:26.635
At the party, Julio and Tenoch
used alcohol and marijuana...

10:26.761 --> 10:29.638
and ecstasy from San Francisco.

10:29.764 --> 10:32.266
Their dating strategies failed.

10:32.976 --> 10:36.979
They worried this failure would be
the blueprint for the rest of the summer.

10:38.356 --> 10:41.150
At 4am Julio threw in the street.

10:41.276 --> 10:45.904
Around 5am, Tenoch smashed
his headlight on the way home.

10:46.031 --> 10:51.743
The same night Saba had his first
group sex experience.

10:58.501 --> 10:59.543
A week went by...

10:59.669 --> 11:02.546
and for Julio and Tenoch,
boredom became routine.

11:03.298 --> 11:06.842
Tenoch's father served on the board
of a country club...

11:06.969 --> 11:12.514
so his son had access to the facilities
on Mondays, when the club was closed.

11:18.605 --> 11:21.398
One, two, three.

12:04.401 --> 12:09.113
You were smoking earlier,
that's why you run out of breath.

12:09.364 --> 12:10.822
Like you're the pro.

12:10.949 --> 12:12.824
You beat me by less than two metres.

12:12.951 --> 12:14.910
Two? I'd say ten!

12:15.037 --> 12:18.705
- Maybe four.
- Let's call it eight.

12:18.831 --> 12:20.707
You're full of shit.

12:22.044 --> 12:24.920
I may be full of shit...

12:25.797 --> 12:29.716
but you've got a really ugly cock.

12:29.842 --> 12:32.803
It looks like a hooded monk...

12:33.972 --> 12:37.975
- So blow it up, arsehole!
- Back off, homo!

12:46.484 --> 12:48.152
Six, seven...

12:48.695 --> 12:51.488
eight, nine, ten, eleven.

12:51.823 --> 12:53.950
Shit, more bodyguards than guests!

12:54.076 --> 12:57.869
Three for the Comonforts,
three for the Guerreros.

12:57.996 --> 12:58.955
Don't point.

12:59.081 --> 13:02.791
My dad's boss brought two,
like that government guy.

13:02.917 --> 13:06.545
- And a shit load for the President.
- Don't forget Herminio.

13:06.671 --> 13:09.881
- No, he's my driver.
- But he's got a gun.

13:12.427 --> 13:16.138
Smart move, sir.
Tenoch is drunk.

13:16.514 --> 13:18.390
Come on, dad.
I already said hello to the President.

13:18.516 --> 13:20.601
The Gonzalez kids are looking for you.

13:20.727 --> 13:22.979
Be nice to them, please!

13:23.105 --> 13:25.064
They've always been so nice with you.

13:26.024 --> 13:28.025
All right, dad.

13:28.151 --> 13:30.611
Do you remember that fat girl?

13:31.696 --> 13:35.074
How are you?
It's been ages!

13:35.200 --> 13:36.575
You see?

13:36.701 --> 13:38.577
What are you doing?

13:42.707 --> 13:44.833
What a bunch of arseholes, right?

13:44.960 --> 13:46.710
- As you say, sir.
- Hey, man.

13:47.212 --> 13:49.671
A rum and coke, light on the coke.

13:58.306 --> 14:01.934
Do you remember your cousin, Tenoch?
He wants to be a writer, too.

14:02.060 --> 14:05.812
I'll let you two catch up. Cheers!

14:05.939 --> 14:07.773
- Cheers.
- Cheers, aunt. Thanks.

14:09.985 --> 14:11.944
- That poor dog.
- Yes.

14:12.070 --> 14:15.739
Last time we met, you were crying...

14:15.865 --> 14:18.409
over the loss of a Ninja Turtle.

14:18.535 --> 14:21.620
- It was a ThunderCat.
- Whatever.

14:21.746 --> 14:25.958
So you want to tell stories
about rich brats?

14:26.084 --> 14:28.044
No, stories about arseholes like you.

14:28.586 --> 14:32.965
It's one thing to write cute stories.
Creating literature is another.

14:33.091 --> 14:35.592
- So when are you starting?
- Did you read my book?

14:35.718 --> 14:38.262
- I've read the reviews.
- Critics are all arseholes!

14:39.806 --> 14:43.935
Alejandro Montes de Oca, "Jano",
was the nephew of Tenoch's mother.

14:44.769 --> 14:49.523
His father died when he was three,
leaving him to his mother's care.

14:49.649 --> 14:53.485
He escaped her excessive attention
by going abroad for a masters.

14:54.196 --> 14:57.573
He was now back after ten years.

14:57.699 --> 15:01.577
Think about it.
Do you really want to be a writer?

15:01.703 --> 15:04.205
Anybody can spell...

15:04.331 --> 15:07.666
but it takes a lifetime to be a writer.

15:07.792 --> 15:09.668
This is my cousin, the writer.

15:09.794 --> 15:12.838
It's not only about discipline and technique.

15:12.965 --> 15:19.261
You have to create your own style.
You need life experience...

15:20.973 --> 15:23.307
What do you really know about life?

15:23.558 --> 15:25.809
Yes, Tenoch, what experience do you have?

15:27.270 --> 15:28.604
Little bastards!

15:29.647 --> 15:30.814
Sorry, I'm sorry.

15:32.025 --> 15:32.984
Are you all right?

15:37.780 --> 15:42.701
Thank you all for joining us...

15:42.827 --> 15:45.537
in this humble celebration.

15:45.663 --> 15:47.039
And especially...

15:47.165 --> 15:50.792
the President of our country
and his lovely wife...

15:51.669 --> 15:54.088
who took time from his busy schedule...

15:54.214 --> 15:57.883
to share this special moment
for Jessica and Francisco Javier...

15:58.010 --> 16:00.677
in spite of their duties.

16:01.221 --> 16:07.601
Your presence is a testimony
of your enormous modesty.

16:07.978 --> 16:11.355
In the presence of such illustrious guests...

16:12.190 --> 16:16.277
I would like to wish the bride and the groom
every happiness.

16:18.696 --> 16:20.031
She's gorgeous.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.242
Hello.

16:23.368 --> 16:25.369
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.

16:25.620 --> 16:27.704
- Hello.
- Hi.

16:28.623 --> 16:30.832
- Aren't you bored of this all?
- No.

16:30.959 --> 16:33.252
- Not even a little bit?
- Excuse me.

16:33.378 --> 16:35.046
- Well, a little bit.
- Yes?

16:36.673 --> 16:39.883
- Where are you from?
- From Madrid, Spain.

16:40.718 --> 16:44.055
- And what brings you here?
- My husband is in the family.

16:44.347 --> 16:47.016
- On which side?
- On the bride's side.

16:48.268 --> 16:50.102
Did you see what they've done to me?

16:50.228 --> 16:52.104
Yes, you, little prick.

16:54.649 --> 17:00.071
Luisa Cortés lost her parents
in a car accident when she was ten.

17:01.031 --> 17:05.742
She was brought up by her great-aunt,
a Franquista spinster who became sick...

17:05.867 --> 17:09.746
and Luisa had to take care of her
for the last five years of her life.

17:10.207 --> 17:14.961
Luisa lived with her until she was 20,
when she married Jano.

17:15.087 --> 17:19.256
Four months later, her aunt died.
She had been her last living relative.

17:19.674 --> 17:22.884
- What happened?
- Those two arseholes.

17:23.011 --> 17:25.137
You can't meet the President like this.

17:26.431 --> 17:28.057
Let's do it another time.

17:28.183 --> 17:30.017
- No, let's go.
- With a bit of salt...

17:30.143 --> 17:32.144
- Salt.
- Let's look for another suit.

17:32.270 --> 17:35.231
- Jano, don't do this to me.
- Careful.

17:36.274 --> 17:37.984
Keep an eye out for my mother.

17:38.110 --> 17:41.737
Hey, is he your husband?

17:41.863 --> 17:44.949
- Yes, why?
- He's my cousin.

17:45.075 --> 17:46.075
His cousin.

17:46.201 --> 17:48.995
- What's your name?
- Me? Tenoch.

17:49.121 --> 17:50.579
- Tenoch?
- Yes.

17:50.705 --> 17:52.748
You're little Tenoch?

17:53.166 --> 17:55.751
I met you years ago,
before getting married.

17:55.877 --> 18:01.173
You were crying because you lost
your ThunderCat.

18:01.299 --> 18:02.341
You have a good memory!

18:02.717 --> 18:04.093
- Do you smoke?
- Thanks.

18:04.802 --> 18:07.096
- You're a man now.
- Thanks.

18:08.015 --> 18:11.100
So, how long have you been here?

18:12.185 --> 18:13.519
About a month.

18:13.645 --> 18:17.189
Jano's teaching at the University.
He's starting in September.

18:17.315 --> 18:20.276
Are you going on holiday?

18:20.402 --> 18:23.195
He's going to Villahermosa
with other scholars.

18:23.321 --> 18:27.283
But I'm staying to fix up the house
and to look for a job.

18:27.409 --> 18:31.328
But if we find the time,
I'd love to go to the beach. And you?

18:31.454 --> 18:34.999
- We're going to the beach.
- To Puerto Escondido, right?

18:35.125 --> 18:39.836
- Jano told me it was beautiful.
- No, that place is rubbish.

18:40.005 --> 18:40.921
Isn't it beautiful?

18:41.048 --> 18:45.051
Only a bunch of yuppie backpackers
and lousy surfers...

18:45.177 --> 18:49.221
We go to a place only the fishermen know.

18:51.516 --> 18:52.766
What's it called?

18:53.268 --> 18:56.770
- Mouth... What's it called?
- Heaven's Mouth.

18:56.896 --> 19:00.316
Heaven's Mouth, sure.

19:00.442 --> 19:03.902
- It's wonderful!
- A paradise!

19:04.029 --> 19:06.280
It's a slice of heaven right here on Earth.

19:06.406 --> 19:07.781
Tropical.

19:08.992 --> 19:11.202
A slice of heaven on earth.

19:11.536 --> 19:14.288
A paradise on earth,
with roots...

19:14.414 --> 19:18.209
- You could come with us.
- Yeah, come with us!

19:18.543 --> 19:19.751
Me?

19:19.877 --> 19:21.920
- Would you take me with you?
- Sure.

19:22.047 --> 19:24.256
- Of course.
- Is there a place to sleep?

19:24.382 --> 19:28.302
Yes, on a bed of sand,
warm and smooth...

19:28.428 --> 19:31.805
- under a starry sky.
- In luxury.

19:31.932 --> 19:35.977
We can drink coconuts
and bring some forties.

19:36.561 --> 19:39.438
- Forties?
- Big bottles of beer.

19:39.564 --> 19:41.273
Jano will love the idea.

19:43.401 --> 19:45.069
The Mariachis.

19:56.123 --> 19:57.957
The president left one hour later.

19:58.083 --> 20:02.711
He had an urgent meeting
with the leaders of his ruling party...

20:02.837 --> 20:06.465
to appoint the candidates
for the upcoming national elections.

20:06.591 --> 20:08.717
The next morning, at 10am...

20:08.843 --> 20:12.054
he would express his outrage
about the Cerro Verde massacre...

20:12.180 --> 20:15.849
and deny that the State Governor was
involved with the tragedy.

20:16.851 --> 20:19.811
After offering condolences
to the relatives of the victims...

20:19.938 --> 20:24.108
he flew to Seattle for a world
summit on globalisation.

20:26.403 --> 20:29.905
The days passed, and while Jano
was away at a symposium...

20:30.032 --> 20:33.117
Luisa went to the doctor to get the results
of some tests.

20:34.119 --> 20:37.997
In the waiting room,
she did a magazine quiz titled...

20:38.123 --> 20:39.999
"Are You A Satisfied Woman?"

20:40.875 --> 20:45.171
In the first question,
Luisa picked answer B:

20:45.297 --> 20:49.341
"I prefer to be awake
rather than sleeping and dreaming."

20:49.467 --> 20:50.968
In question four, C:

20:51.428 --> 20:54.138
"I value time more highly
than money or power."

20:55.307 --> 20:57.141
In question seven, A:

20:57.267 --> 21:00.394
"I think more about the present
than the past or the future."

21:01.479 --> 21:03.272
She scored 16 points.

21:04.024 --> 21:08.027
The magazine defined her as a woman
who is afraid to accept her freedom.

21:09.154 --> 21:10.904
Luisa didn't agree.

21:13.450 --> 21:17.203
Think about Conchita's tits.
Those stiff and hard nipples.

21:17.329 --> 21:19.330
Nice!

21:20.165 --> 21:22.833
And Mayela's pussy?

21:22.960 --> 21:26.253
All wet and hairy.

21:26.921 --> 21:29.465
- And your girlfriend's mother?
- Shut up.

21:29.591 --> 21:31.258
That Arts teacher?

21:31.384 --> 21:36.222
- Yes, Miss Georgina.
- She never wore knickers.

21:37.682 --> 21:41.435
- Salma Hayek!
- Yeah, Salmita!

21:41.561 --> 21:44.939
- Hey, your cousin.
- What cousin?

21:45.523 --> 21:46.983
The...

21:47.109 --> 21:48.985
The Spanish one!

22:11.049 --> 22:12.049
Yes?

22:13.635 --> 22:14.635
Hello?

22:15.345 --> 22:17.721
- My love.
- Jano.

22:20.642 --> 22:22.018
Are you fine?

22:24.729 --> 22:26.688
It's just that...

22:28.525 --> 22:30.234
I'm drunk, Luisa.

22:30.693 --> 22:32.987
Then go to sleep.
We'll talk tomorrow.

22:33.738 --> 22:36.157
I'll be back in two days.

22:36.283 --> 22:40.369
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.

22:40.495 --> 22:44.665
I'm an idiot.
I swear. I'm a piece of shit.

22:47.002 --> 22:48.544
Go to sleep, you're drunk.

22:48.670 --> 22:51.630
I'm an arsehole.
A piece of shit.

22:51.756 --> 22:54.425
Calm down.
What's wrong?

22:55.593 --> 22:57.636
- Are you all right?
- It's just that...

22:57.762 --> 22:59.388
It's just that...

23:00.265 --> 23:02.141
I've slept with another woman.

23:06.313 --> 23:08.439
I'm telling you, I'm a piece of shit.

23:11.068 --> 23:12.443
Luisa?

23:15.113 --> 23:17.323
Why are you telling me this?

23:17.449 --> 23:19.992
I love you so much!

23:20.118 --> 23:22.286
Why are you telling me this?

24:29.521 --> 24:32.106
Here is your sandwich, darling.

24:32.232 --> 24:34.858
- With your favourite cheese.
- Thanks.

24:37.195 --> 24:38.362
Hello?

24:38.488 --> 24:40.114
One moment, please.

24:40.782 --> 24:42.658
It's for you, Tenoch.

24:48.456 --> 24:51.125
- Who is it?
- It's Luisa.

24:53.128 --> 24:54.920
The Spanish.

24:55.380 --> 24:58.257
Oh, hello! How are you?

24:58.383 --> 25:01.552
I'm glad I've found you.
You said you were leaving today.

25:02.470 --> 25:05.722
- To go where?
- To Heaven's Mouth, right?

25:06.724 --> 25:09.310
Yes, we're leaving today.

25:09.436 --> 25:13.897
- Are you ready yet?
- Well, we're sorting things out.

25:14.899 --> 25:17.234
- Listen, a question...
- What?

25:19.821 --> 25:22.781
Is your invitation still valid?

25:23.408 --> 25:24.408
Hello?

25:25.410 --> 25:27.036
- Well...
- I guess it isn't.

25:27.162 --> 25:30.622
- It's OK, never mind.
- Wait. Yes, yes.

25:30.748 --> 25:35.502
- Never mind, I don't want to bother you.
- No, it's fine.

25:35.628 --> 25:38.505
Just tell us where to pick you up.

25:39.549 --> 25:44.386
I live at 52, Calle Machu Picchu.
Third floor, intern D, like delta.

25:52.604 --> 25:55.772
- Hello?
- Still sleeping, you lazy fuck?

25:56.984 --> 26:01.237
I was up all night watching videos.

26:01.654 --> 26:05.116
- Hurry up, we're going to the beach.
- What?

26:05.242 --> 26:07.284
To Heaven's Mouth.

26:07.410 --> 26:12.123
- But it doesn't exist.
- I know, but Luisa wants to go there.

26:12.415 --> 26:14.375
- What Luisa?
- The Spaniard.

26:14.876 --> 26:19.338
- Are you joking? Really?
- Really. We need your car.

26:19.464 --> 26:24.260
Absolutely not. It won't make it,
the radiator's fucked...

26:24.386 --> 26:28.347
Plus it's my sister's turn to use it.
Let's take yours.

26:28.473 --> 26:30.807
My dad took it away because of
the smashed headlight...

26:30.934 --> 26:33.978
- and for not taking Economics.
- What an arsehole.

26:34.980 --> 26:38.190
Julio Zapata lived
with his mother and his sister.

26:38.316 --> 26:42.361
He hadn't seen his father
since he was five.

26:42.946 --> 26:48.284
His mother had always been
a secretary in a corporation.

26:51.329 --> 26:54.581
His sister Manuela, known as "Boinas"...

26:54.707 --> 26:59.336
studied Political Science at the
National University of Mexico.

27:00.713 --> 27:05.509
After a long negotiation, Julio managed
to borrow the car for five days.

27:05.635 --> 27:07.469
In exchange, she would get it
for the following three weeks...

27:07.595 --> 27:10.056
so that she could drive to Chiapas
with her friends

27:10.182 --> 27:12.891
to deliver clothing, and medicine and food.

27:16.271 --> 27:18.314
- Beer!
- Beer, beer, beer.

27:19.024 --> 27:20.024
Here's the beer.

27:20.900 --> 27:23.235
One, two...

27:23.361 --> 27:24.361
For three!

27:25.530 --> 27:27.406
Condoms!

27:28.033 --> 27:30.784
- Where's your size?
- It's the men's sector.

27:33.663 --> 27:35.831
Beware, mate.

27:36.666 --> 27:40.211
After Puebla, just take the back roads...

27:40.337 --> 27:44.506
- The landscape is awesome.
- Got it.

27:44.632 --> 27:48.427
Then follow this road.

27:48.553 --> 27:50.846
That's not a road, you fool, it's a river!

27:50.973 --> 27:53.390
- You're going towards Veracruz!
- A river...

27:53.516 --> 27:57.061
- Which way do we go, man?
- Towards Oaxaca.

27:57.187 --> 27:59.313
Then you go this way...

27:59.439 --> 28:02.399
but watch out for roadblocks.

28:02.525 --> 28:06.946
Hide your stuff where they can't find it
and drive like a saint...

28:07.072 --> 28:09.906
- Saba, we're in a hurry.
- Yes, be quick.

28:10.033 --> 28:14.495
Then you get to this small village...

28:14.621 --> 28:19.458
you drive by this massive Coke bottle
and there's this cow, remember I told you?

28:19.584 --> 28:22.794
- Saba, and then what?
- Yeah, then?

28:22.920 --> 28:24.380
What?

28:26.341 --> 28:28.759
- The beach, ugly fool!
- Yeah, the beach.

28:28.885 --> 28:33.680
Turn right on a dirt road
and you're on the beach.

28:34.599 --> 28:36.183
That's all.

28:49.031 --> 28:50.906
Yes?

28:51.033 --> 28:52.616
I'll be right down.

29:41.959 --> 29:43.542
Give it to me, I'll help you.

30:21.248 --> 30:22.748
Be quiet, it's my car.

30:26.169 --> 30:30.047
- What do you do for a living.
- What do you think?

30:30.173 --> 30:32.258
- You're a sociologist.
- Cold.

30:32.384 --> 30:36.053
- Philosopher?
- No, cold.

30:36.554 --> 30:38.597
- Psychologist.
- Really?

30:38.723 --> 30:41.183
- A Victoria's Secret model?
- Freezing!

30:41.559 --> 30:42.809
We give up.

30:43.228 --> 30:46.063
I'm a certified dental technician.

30:46.189 --> 30:50.609
- What's that?
- She dries your drooling, at the dentist.

30:50.735 --> 30:52.069
- Really?
- Yes.

30:52.195 --> 30:55.114
- Why such a choice?
- I didn't choose it.

30:55.240 --> 30:58.075
When I played with my dolls...

30:58.201 --> 31:00.661
I didn't pretend to suck out their drool.

31:00.787 --> 31:06.875
- Why then?
- I was 16, my aunt fell sick...

31:07.002 --> 31:09.503
and I had to find a job fast.

31:09.629 --> 31:11.797
In four months I had a degree.

31:11.923 --> 31:14.216
But what did you really want to do?

31:14.801 --> 31:17.136
I never did very well at school...

31:17.262 --> 31:19.263
all I wanted to do...

31:20.015 --> 31:22.016
was travel.

31:22.142 --> 31:23.935
Travel...

31:24.061 --> 31:27.604
- Yeah, I love taking trips.
- Yeah, on acid.

31:27.730 --> 31:32.151
- You've never been on a plane!
- Yes, I have!

31:32.277 --> 31:34.820
- Three times, big deal.
- So what?

31:35.697 --> 31:37.531
You really thought I was a philosopher?

31:37.657 --> 31:42.119
- You look like a thinker.
- And you're married to Jano.

31:43.956 --> 31:48.792
Luisa often went to dinners with Jano
and his artist and intellectual friends.

31:48.918 --> 31:50.836
She was never comfortable.

31:51.879 --> 31:56.508
There was always someone,
whether with good intentions or not...

31:56.634 --> 32:00.137
who would press Luisa for an opinion
during their debates.

32:00.263 --> 32:03.432
Humbly, she used to answer...

32:03.558 --> 32:05.935
"I don't know anything about these things."

32:06.811 --> 32:09.646
She often thought about challenging
the guests...

32:09.772 --> 32:13.234
to see if anyone could name every tooth
in the right order.

32:14.652 --> 32:15.945
She never dared.

32:19.907 --> 32:22.034
Hey charolastra, pass me the crisps.

32:22.160 --> 32:23.827
What's charo...

32:23.954 --> 32:26.538
- Charolastra?
- Yes. What's it?

32:26.664 --> 32:29.500
"Charo" is kind of a Mexican cowboy,
so it's something like "astral cowboy".

32:29.626 --> 32:30.626
- Cool, isn't it?
- Very.

32:30.752 --> 32:35.464
Actually, Daniel didn't understand
the lyrics to this English song.

32:35.590 --> 32:38.968
Char-olas-tra, char-o-lo...

32:39.094 --> 32:41.137
Charolastra, charolo

32:41.972 --> 32:47.059
According to Saba... it refers to the dead
weight we are for your father.

32:47.185 --> 32:50.854
- So Daniel and Saba are "charolastras"?
- Yes.

32:50.981 --> 32:54.650
But Saba has been taken
by the investigation of...

32:54.776 --> 32:57.528
the altered states
of his expanded conscience.

32:57.654 --> 32:59.821
- In a mystical phase?
- No, dope.

32:59.948 --> 33:03.784
- He's out of his mind.
- We see Daniel less and less.

33:03.910 --> 33:07.829
- He's drifting away.
- Is that why you don't see him?

33:07.956 --> 33:11.625
No, it's not that. He's just into other things.

33:11.751 --> 33:13.919
But he's still in the club.

33:14.379 --> 33:17.756
Pecas is just a honorary member...

33:17.882 --> 33:19.758
because she has terrible boyfriends.

33:19.884 --> 33:23.220
- She didn't sign our manifesto.
- Manifesto?

33:23.721 --> 33:25.097
What does it say?

33:25.223 --> 33:28.100
- No way.
- It's secret.

33:28.226 --> 33:31.728
- I won't tell anyone.
- We'd be forced to kill you.

33:32.397 --> 33:36.150
One: There's no greater honour
than being a Charolastra.

33:36.276 --> 33:38.945
Two: Do whatever you feel like.

33:39.404 --> 33:41.655
Three: Pop beats poetry.

33:41.781 --> 33:45.742
- Four: Get high at least once a day.
- Saba's idea.

33:45.868 --> 33:48.745
Five: You shall not screw a fellow
charolastra's girlfriend.

33:48.871 --> 33:50.706
Six: Team America's supporters
are queers.

33:50.832 --> 33:52.959
Seven: Forget morals and rules!

33:53.085 --> 33:55.294
Eight: Never marry a virgin.

33:55.420 --> 33:57.879
- Nine: Club America's supporters...
- You've already said that.

33:58.006 --> 34:01.425
It's worth repeating.
They are queers.

34:01.676 --> 34:03.677
Crappy team.

34:03.803 --> 34:06.555
Ten: Truth is cool but unattainable.

34:06.681 --> 34:10.766
The truth is totally amazing,
but you can never reach it.

34:10.893 --> 34:16.065
Eleven: The arsehole who breaks
any of the previous rules...

34:16.190 --> 34:19.400
Loses his title of charolastra.

34:21.112 --> 34:24.822
You should give your Manifesto
to the government. It would be a success.

34:24.949 --> 34:27.284
Nah, politicians are arseholes.
But it's cool, isn't it?

34:27.409 --> 34:29.745
Don't the charolastras eat?

34:30.413 --> 34:33.165
Julio and Tenoch told her
many other stories.

34:34.126 --> 34:37.210
Each story reinforced their bond...

34:37.337 --> 34:40.714
creating an inseparable entity.

34:41.924 --> 34:47.013
The stories, although adorned by
personal mythology, were true.

34:47.973 --> 34:51.183
But as truth is always partial,
some facts were omitted.

34:52.226 --> 34:57.689
It was never mentioned how Julio
lit matches to hide the smell...

34:57.815 --> 34:59.691
in Tenoch's house...

34:59.817 --> 35:04.238
Or that Tenoch used his foot
to lift the toilet seat at Julio's house.

35:05.365 --> 35:08.784
Those were details that one didn't need
to know about the other.

35:11.204 --> 35:13.830
- Do you have girlfriends?
- Yes, Ceci.

35:13.957 --> 35:15.958
- Ana Bananas.
- Bananas?

35:16.376 --> 35:17.376
And where are they now?

35:17.502 --> 35:20.879
Travelling around Europe, on holiday.
They're cool.

35:21.006 --> 35:24.800
- Where in Europe?
- Around Italy.

35:25.343 --> 35:26.552
They're lucky.

35:26.761 --> 35:29.931
- They say it's wonderful.
- Yes, but that's not why.

35:30.057 --> 35:33.017
- Why?
- Why do girls go to Italy?

35:33.143 --> 35:34.435
- For the clothes?
- On holiday?

35:34.561 --> 35:38.064
The men! Italian guys are sexy!

35:38.190 --> 35:41.733
What are you saying?
You don't know them.

35:41.859 --> 35:45.196
- Right.
- Ceci would never cheat on me.

35:45.322 --> 35:47.781
- She wanted to tattoo my name on her tit.
- Yes.

35:49.117 --> 35:52.661
- But her mother didn't want her to.
- I popped Ana's cherry.

35:52.787 --> 35:54.830
- She only does it with me.
- Exactly.

35:54.957 --> 35:56.873
I'm pleased.

35:57.000 --> 36:01.963
Your girlfriends are lucky
to have boyfriends like you.

36:02.089 --> 36:05.799
- And are you charolastras faithful?
- Of course.

36:06.218 --> 36:07.343
Good. As it should be.

36:08.886 --> 36:10.721
Have you ever cheated on Jano?

36:11.223 --> 36:14.225
Me? Cheating on Jano?
No, I'd never do that.

36:14.351 --> 36:16.810
- I'm so hungry...
- Here comes the lady.

36:18.063 --> 36:20.064
Has he ever cheated on you?

36:21.899 --> 36:25.069
Jano has always needed reaffirmation.

36:25.528 --> 36:26.695
Really?

36:26.821 --> 36:28.864
- Has he cheated on you?
- Go and get some beers.

36:28.991 --> 36:31.951
- One for me too.
- Where did you meet him?

36:32.077 --> 36:34.120
- In a bar in Madrid.
- Really?

36:34.246 --> 36:36.956
I bet he was drunk.

36:37.082 --> 36:41.460
No, he was sober.
I was the one who was wasted.

36:41.586 --> 36:43.004
I was there with friends.

36:43.130 --> 36:45.131
- Really?
- Yes.

36:45.590 --> 36:47.716
- And?
- And then?

36:47.842 --> 36:51.928
I saw this sharp guy, full of attitude.

36:52.055 --> 36:54.431
He comes to me and goes:

36:54.557 --> 36:58.560
- "You're gorgeous!"
- What did you see in him?

36:59.854 --> 37:01.522
Really, what did you see?

37:02.524 --> 37:05.901
Well, I don't know.
Jano and I share a lot of things.

37:06.653 --> 37:08.237
Like?

37:08.947 --> 37:10.614
Well...

37:11.241 --> 37:13.867
He has no father and I'm an orphan.

37:15.578 --> 37:18.956
His mother was annoying...

37:19.082 --> 37:20.874
like the aunt I used to live with.

37:21.960 --> 37:25.379
Those five years
I took care of her were terrible.

37:25.505 --> 37:26.505
Poor thing.

37:26.631 --> 37:30.884
Jano was the only one there for me.

37:31.636 --> 37:33.971
- Shall we toast?
- Sure!

37:34.889 --> 37:36.933
To relaxing.

37:37.517 --> 37:40.477
- So what will you have?
- I don't know...

38:09.924 --> 38:12.343
Thanks. Good night.

38:12.927 --> 38:14.595
Good night.

38:20.602 --> 38:23.145
- Shit!
- The little one's for you!

38:24.106 --> 38:27.358
- Spliff?
- Coming right up.

38:27.484 --> 38:28.484
- Hey.
- What's up?

38:28.610 --> 38:31.570
Do you think Ana and Ceci
are fucking any Italians?

38:31.696 --> 38:35.950
- No way!
- There's piss all over.

38:36.659 --> 38:39.578
- No, right?
- Absolutely not.

38:39.704 --> 38:42.206
And Italians are queers.

38:42.332 --> 38:43.499
Sure.

38:45.043 --> 38:48.587
Do you think your cousin
wants to have sex?

38:48.713 --> 38:52.549
- Looks like Jano cheats on her.
- Serious stuff, eh?

38:53.718 --> 38:58.847
Maybe we can heal her pain
and make her happy.

38:59.182 --> 39:02.018
I'll show you.
Come on.

39:33.675 --> 39:35.509
Hi, guys.

39:36.344 --> 39:38.012
I'm coming.

39:39.139 --> 39:41.223
- What's up?
- Still in bed?

39:41.349 --> 39:43.434
Let's go.
We'll never make it to the beach.

39:43.560 --> 39:48.355
- Come on, you lazy shit!
- Julio, let's go.

39:51.651 --> 39:53.152
Now?

39:55.780 --> 39:59.075
- Nice. Early bird special.
- This way.

39:59.201 --> 40:02.536
- Can you drive like that?
- Yes.

40:03.788 --> 40:05.622
You won't even feel the curves.

40:10.337 --> 40:12.463
We fly like the Concorde.

40:15.300 --> 40:17.468
It's high-grade dog shit.

40:18.845 --> 40:22.556
- Very nice dog shit.
- Sure.

40:26.478 --> 40:28.062
Good.

40:28.188 --> 40:30.606
- Do you smoke a lot?
- Now and then. You?

40:30.732 --> 40:33.400
- Not usually.
- Want a beer?

40:35.528 --> 40:38.197
Tenoch realised he had never visited
Tepelmeme...

40:38.656 --> 40:42.994
the birthplace of Leodegaria Victoria,
his nanny...

40:43.120 --> 40:45.955
who emigrated to Mexico City
when she was 13.

40:47.332 --> 40:52.336
She found work with Tenoch's family
and had cared for him since he was born.

40:53.338 --> 40:56.048
He called her "mummy"
until he was four years old.

40:57.175 --> 40:59.676
Tenoch did not share this
with the others.

40:59.802 --> 41:03.472
- Give me a little more.
- There's something for everyone.

41:05.183 --> 41:07.101
I saw you last night.

41:07.227 --> 41:08.560
- What?
- What?

41:09.271 --> 41:11.855
- You know what I'm talking about.
- No, what?

41:14.442 --> 41:17.486
You think it's cool to spy on women
in their hotel rooms?

41:18.655 --> 41:21.198
It was his idea.

41:21.324 --> 41:22.449
Ah, yes?

41:23.410 --> 41:25.786
And you followed him.

41:25.912 --> 41:28.747
- Did you want to see me naked?
- No.

41:28.873 --> 41:32.876
- See me naked and have a wank.
- Come on.

41:35.380 --> 41:37.339
Tell me one thing...

41:38.675 --> 41:42.428
Did you make love
with many other women?

41:42.554 --> 41:45.097
- A few.
- Bullshit.

41:45.223 --> 41:49.226
- What.
- He's only fucked his girlfriend.

41:49.352 --> 41:51.520
- You're wrong, arsehole!
- Who else then?

41:52.730 --> 41:56.692
- Flavia.
- That's bullshit!

41:56.818 --> 42:01.530
The idiot came while
he was putting the condom on.

42:01.656 --> 42:03.782
- You told me.
- What?

42:03.908 --> 42:05.451
A donation for the Queen?

42:05.953 --> 42:07.411
And you, Tenoch?

42:07.537 --> 42:09.621
- What?
- Have you made love with others...

42:09.747 --> 42:11.040
Thank you.

42:11.166 --> 42:13.250
...apart from your girlfriend?
- Two or three.

42:13.376 --> 42:16.295
- Yes, two or three hookers.
- Hookers?

42:16.421 --> 42:19.298
- Whores.
- Really? Do you go with whores?

42:19.882 --> 42:22.426
The little queen is gorgeous.

42:22.552 --> 42:25.262
- I don't go with whores.
- You do.

42:25.388 --> 42:27.723
- You're a whore-chaser.
- No way.

42:27.849 --> 42:30.767
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

42:32.229 --> 42:33.770
Wonderful!

42:41.196 --> 42:44.490
Did you fuck many guys before Jano?

42:45.867 --> 42:48.410
I started late and met Jano soon.

42:48.536 --> 42:53.624
- Were you a virgin?
- A virgin? No.

42:54.209 --> 42:55.542
There was a guy before.

42:55.668 --> 43:00.172
And he gave it to you. Wham, bam!
Tell us the truth.

43:00.298 --> 43:01.632
Actually, yes.

43:03.760 --> 43:08.222
He took me to the factory where his uncle
worked as a security guard.

43:08.348 --> 43:11.433
I was so scared, I barely knew him.

43:12.310 --> 43:15.479
I thought he wanted to kiss me.
Instead...

43:15.981 --> 43:17.273
he popped my cherry.

43:17.690 --> 43:21.527
- The bastard.
- It hurt so badly...

43:21.653 --> 43:24.696
I thought I'd never do it again.

43:24.822 --> 43:28.242
But we did it every time we saw each other.

43:31.329 --> 43:33.872
I thought he just wanted to have sex...

43:33.999 --> 43:35.874
but he also wanted to talk.

43:37.752 --> 43:40.379
- He fell in love with me.
- Who wouldn't?

43:40.505 --> 43:44.716
He'd pick me up from school on his bike,
in a leather jacket.

43:45.677 --> 43:48.762
It was amazing. I was fascinated by him.

43:48.888 --> 43:51.348
I always bunked off any time I could.

43:51.474 --> 43:53.976
Bunking off,
like doing blow jobs and stuff?

43:54.102 --> 43:55.227
Yes, that, too.

43:55.353 --> 43:57.771
No, bunking off means
skipping school lessons.

43:58.898 --> 44:01.525
I used to skip lessons
to spend more time with him...

44:01.651 --> 44:06.530
We'd go to the park,
or take a ride on his bike.

44:08.491 --> 44:12.244
We were even about to go
to the French Riviera.

44:12.370 --> 44:13.745
Me too.

44:13.871 --> 44:16.707
A friend found him a job there as a waiter.

44:17.834 --> 44:20.294
We had everything packed and ready.

44:20.963 --> 44:25.382
He had a ponytail and a broken tooth.

44:25.508 --> 44:27.843
And an earring on the right.

44:29.304 --> 44:31.638
I was so in love with him, I swear.

44:32.890 --> 44:34.558
Deeply in love.

44:35.685 --> 44:38.312
- Then Jano came along, right?
- No.

44:39.522 --> 44:42.566
- So what?
- He died in a bike accident.

44:44.069 --> 44:45.569
Shit.

44:46.071 --> 44:47.738
He was 17.

44:52.995 --> 44:56.288
If they had passed this spot
10 years earlier...

44:56.414 --> 44:59.583
they would have seen a couple of cages
in the middle of the road...

45:01.461 --> 45:04.338
and then driven through a cloud
of white feathers.

45:05.673 --> 45:12.388
Shortly after, more crushed cages, filled
with bleeding chickens flapping their wings.

45:12.931 --> 45:16.350
Later on, an overturned truck,
surrounded with smoke.

45:18.561 --> 45:22.564
Then they'd have seen
two bodies on the road...

45:22.690 --> 45:26.360
one smaller than the other,
barely covered by a jacket.

45:26.486 --> 45:29.030
And next to them,
a woman crying inconsolably.

45:49.884 --> 45:51.552
Give me a cigarette.

46:17.912 --> 46:21.582
- No, it's a nice song.
- The battery is down.

46:23.460 --> 46:25.502
Turn on the radio.

46:27.047 --> 46:28.672
Shit.

46:28.798 --> 46:30.924
- Hide all the stuff.
- Don't worry.

46:31.051 --> 46:34.095
- Keep calm.
- Don't look at them.

46:34.930 --> 46:38.015
Look, they got arrested.

46:39.434 --> 46:41.102
Don't look at them.

47:18.181 --> 47:19.723
What's going on?

47:23.145 --> 47:26.022
Wow, look what just woke up!

47:26.148 --> 47:28.065
That woke up both of you.

47:29.776 --> 47:31.027
Must be the heat.

47:32.487 --> 47:35.447
- Got a hard-on?
- And how!

47:35.573 --> 47:38.742
- That little thing?
- Small?

47:38.868 --> 47:42.955
My Teodoro is only 5 millimetres shorter
than your Rasputin.

47:43.081 --> 47:45.124
Bullshit.

47:45.250 --> 47:46.833
- Did you measure them?
- Yes.

47:46.960 --> 47:49.795
- His is really ugly.
- How ugly?

47:49.921 --> 47:51.922
- He has a hood.
- Come on.

47:52.049 --> 47:54.591
- Yummy!
- What?

47:55.135 --> 47:57.636
- See?
- It's rubbish, it's disgusting.

48:03.977 --> 48:05.852
How do you make love with them?

48:06.854 --> 48:11.150
- Sweetly, passionately.
- Yeah, with jiribilla.

48:11.276 --> 48:14.028
With what?

48:14.154 --> 48:16.238
With tenderness.

48:17.032 --> 48:22.161
- What do you do to them?
- First, some foreplay to heat up the oven.

48:22.287 --> 48:28.167
Kisses on her tits
and nibbling on her nipples.

48:29.086 --> 48:30.044
And then?

48:30.170 --> 48:34.881
- Then I stick it all in.
- With jiribilla.

48:35.008 --> 48:36.008
And then?

48:37.177 --> 48:39.928
I screw her till she begs for mercy.

48:40.055 --> 48:42.514
- That's it?
- What do you mean?

48:42.640 --> 48:46.518
Ceci twists and moans,
like an oyster with lime.

48:46.644 --> 48:49.605
- Ana cries.
- Oh, poor darling.

48:49.731 --> 48:52.566
- No, she cries with pleasure.
- I can imagine.

48:52.692 --> 48:57.738
- In the missionary position?
- Missionary, doggy-style, everything.

48:57.864 --> 49:01.993
Ana likes to be on top,
sitting down, too...

49:03.036 --> 49:06.622
And a good 69, as well.
All the Kamasutra.

49:06.748 --> 49:09.000
- All of it?
- I do everything.

49:10.127 --> 49:15.047
And what about that thing
when you put a finger in...

49:15.173 --> 49:18.134
- in the arse?
- In the arse? Oh, fuck!

49:23.848 --> 49:26.850
Go get some water!
Some water!

49:48.873 --> 49:51.083
- I told you.
- Towards San Rafael.

49:52.044 --> 49:54.753
- And how much does it take?
- It'll be ready tomorrow.

49:54.879 --> 49:58.507
No, but thanks anyway.

49:59.676 --> 50:03.054
- Nice sombrero.
- Yes, really nice.

50:03.180 --> 50:05.639
You can keep it.

50:05.765 --> 50:07.558
- Really?
- Yes.

50:07.684 --> 50:08.935
- Is it a gift?
- Yes.

50:09.061 --> 50:09.936
- Really?
- Yes.

50:10.062 --> 50:11.437
Thanks.

50:12.981 --> 50:14.982
It looks good on me.

50:18.070 --> 50:19.820
Here's the coconut.

50:26.286 --> 50:28.287
- Thanks.
- Sorry.

50:56.233 --> 50:57.942
That's my name.

50:59.277 --> 51:03.072
Beautiful name, Luisita.

51:06.368 --> 51:10.454
Hi, Jano. I know you're not back yet, but...

51:10.580 --> 51:13.958
I'm calling because I didn't leave
any messages, not to make you worry.

51:16.253 --> 51:19.964
I wanted to disappear from your life,
no warning - gone.

51:20.090 --> 51:21.966
Now I realise that's wrong.

51:22.717 --> 51:27.013
This is my message,
but actually, I don't know what to say.

51:28.390 --> 51:31.100
I met a woman named Doña Martina.

51:31.893 --> 51:35.396
She's 98 and she remembers everything
since when she was 5.

51:36.731 --> 51:38.399
Imagine all she has lived...

51:40.485 --> 51:43.487
and everything you would never
get a chance to live.

51:45.823 --> 51:48.492
Your mother sent the mousse you like,
it's in the fridge.

51:49.161 --> 51:52.496
Don't forget to pay the phone bill,
it's on your desk.

51:53.456 --> 51:56.292
Pick up your shirts from the laundry.

51:56.418 --> 51:59.753
Don't go there anymore,
they ruin your clothes.

52:01.464 --> 52:04.091
Well, take care.

52:10.765 --> 52:12.266
See you.

52:19.441 --> 52:21.025
Pass me the shampoo.

52:23.028 --> 52:24.070
Shampoo!

52:25.113 --> 52:27.239
Please.

52:48.303 --> 52:51.055
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, you can come in.

52:53.058 --> 52:55.184
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

52:55.310 --> 52:59.438
It must be the heat, and the long drive.

52:59.564 --> 53:02.066
Could we borrow some shampoo?

53:03.901 --> 53:05.111
Did you bring it?

53:11.243 --> 53:13.785
Take the towel off.

53:13.911 --> 53:15.037
What?

53:16.789 --> 53:18.874
Take it off.

53:20.002 --> 53:22.003
- The towel?
- Yes, the towel.

53:25.966 --> 53:27.633
Take it off, Tenoch.

53:31.346 --> 53:35.141
Don't cover yourself.

53:36.434 --> 53:39.895
- You're easily turned on, eh?
- Yeah, right?

53:42.607 --> 53:46.402
- You lied, it curves to the left.
- What?

53:46.528 --> 53:50.031
You said it curved to the right,
but it curves left.

53:51.283 --> 53:53.909
- Oh, yeah.
- I imagined it that way, you know.

53:56.246 --> 53:58.122
Why don't you stroke it?

53:59.291 --> 54:01.083
Stroke it? Here?

54:01.209 --> 54:04.336
- Stroke it. Touch yourself.
- No.

54:04.921 --> 54:06.922
Do you want me to help you?

54:08.216 --> 54:10.217
Do you want me to show you my tits?

54:13.638 --> 54:15.639
I'll show them if you touch yourself.

54:20.478 --> 54:22.479
Come here, Tenoch.

54:25.233 --> 54:27.234
Closer.

54:51.926 --> 54:54.595
I'm wet. Want to feel it?

54:55.555 --> 54:57.223
- Yes.
- Touch me.

54:57.349 --> 54:58.349
Touch me.

55:04.731 --> 55:07.358
Lick me, Tenoch, lick me.

55:13.156 --> 55:16.658
- But take my knickers off.
- Sure, sure.

55:26.378 --> 55:28.462
No, come up here.

55:56.449 --> 55:59.994
Mamacita!

56:05.500 --> 56:08.377
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine, it doesn't matter.

56:09.254 --> 56:11.088
Relax.

56:30.317 --> 56:34.111
Julio didn't know what he felt.
He only knew it wasn't anger.

56:35.238 --> 56:39.575
The only time he had felt this pain
in his stomach was when he was 8...

56:40.118 --> 56:42.203
when he woke up thirsty one night...

56:42.329 --> 56:46.540
and on his way to the kitchen
found his mother in his godfather's arms.

56:48.626 --> 56:51.170
Julio had retired in silence...

56:52.130 --> 56:54.256
and never told anyone about it.

57:04.184 --> 57:06.143
How are you, pal?

57:06.269 --> 57:07.353
I'm here.

57:07.479 --> 57:09.313
What about a little challenge?

57:10.398 --> 57:13.484
- No, it's all full of leaves.
- No problem.

57:20.158 --> 57:22.201
OK.

58:06.913 --> 58:08.747
You've let me beat you.

58:14.171 --> 58:15.754
You had no reason.

58:17.382 --> 58:19.133
I fucked Ana.

58:19.759 --> 58:21.302
What?

58:23.263 --> 58:25.431
You heard me. I fucked your girlfriend.

58:28.768 --> 58:33.564
Tenoch had only felt this pain
in his stomach when he was 11...

58:34.066 --> 58:38.152
when he saw a photo of his father
on an article that linked him to a scandal...

58:38.278 --> 58:41.780
involving the sale of
contaminated food to the poor.

58:43.366 --> 58:47.244
Tenoch and his parents moved to
Vancouver for eight months.

58:48.621 --> 58:50.914
Tenoch never asked the reason.

59:03.803 --> 59:06.555
Luisa didn't know about Julio's confession.

59:06.681 --> 59:11.185
During dinner, though,
she felt the tension between the two friends.

59:11.894 --> 59:15.189
She assumed that her transgression
had disrupted a natural balance...

59:15.315 --> 59:17.316
that only she could restore.

59:17.442 --> 59:19.568
- Good night.
- Good night.

59:23.448 --> 59:25.324
Good night, Tenoch.

59:38.380 --> 59:40.214
What's up?

59:40.340 --> 59:42.716
- You're not sleeping with Luisa?
- Fuck off.

01:00:09.577 --> 01:00:11.703
How many times did you fuck her?

01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:14.873
Just once. We were really wasted.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.168
- When?
- Stop it.

01:00:17.294 --> 01:00:20.587
- No, tell me. When?
- I don't know.

01:00:22.465 --> 01:00:24.341
You don't know, arsehole?

01:00:25.843 --> 01:00:27.719
When you went to Lake Tahoe.

01:00:29.056 --> 01:00:32.516
- And where was Cecilia?
- She was sick.

01:00:33.351 --> 01:00:35.019
Was it at her place?

01:00:35.687 --> 01:00:37.563
- No.
- Where then?

01:00:39.274 --> 01:00:41.650
- At a party.
- What party, arsehole?

01:00:43.028 --> 01:00:47.698
I don't know, mate.
I think at Fruit Loop's place.

01:00:50.035 --> 01:00:52.453
When Saba popped her cherry?

01:00:54.289 --> 01:00:57.583
- I think so.
- Why are you laughing, fucker?

01:00:59.044 --> 01:01:00.877
- Saba.
- Don't laugh!

01:01:02.297 --> 01:01:06.883
- Who started it?
- Both. We were so fucking drunk.

01:01:10.055 --> 01:01:12.431
And where did you do it?

01:01:12.557 --> 01:01:13.933
In the sister's room.

01:01:17.895 --> 01:01:19.396
How was Ana dressed?

01:01:20.023 --> 01:01:23.484
- Shit! I can't remember.
- Was she wearing trousers or a skirt?

01:01:25.403 --> 01:01:27.279
What knickers was she wearing?

01:01:27.739 --> 01:01:31.908
- What knickers? You've heard me!
- White, I suppose.

01:01:32.035 --> 01:01:34.786
- Did she take it in her mouth?
- No!

01:01:34.912 --> 01:01:37.081
Look at me, idiot. Did she suck it?

01:01:37.958 --> 01:01:41.627
- Did you lick her?
- No, of course not.

01:01:41.753 --> 01:01:46.923
- Did she come?
- How do I know? It was very quick.

01:01:47.050 --> 01:01:49.801
- Did she enjoy it?
- How could I know?

01:01:49.927 --> 01:01:53.973
- And you, arsehole, did you enjoy it?
- No, no.

01:01:54.099 --> 01:01:56.558
I felt like shit, I swear.

01:01:57.769 --> 01:01:59.478
I wanted to tell you...

01:01:59.604 --> 01:02:01.105
Go to hell, fucker!

01:02:01.898 --> 01:02:05.276
You fucked our friendship!
You fucked my trust!

01:02:05.402 --> 01:02:07.653
You fucked my girl, arsehole!
You fucked me!

01:02:09.406 --> 01:02:13.492
I'm the biggest loser,
bringing you comics from Lake Tahoe.

01:02:13.618 --> 01:02:16.787
And a dress for Ana, that slut!

01:02:17.956 --> 01:02:19.373
That's fucked up.

01:02:21.084 --> 01:02:22.459
Fuck off.

01:02:25.047 --> 01:02:28.924
Tenoch, I'm sorry, man.

01:02:30.593 --> 01:02:32.469
I didn't mean it.

01:02:33.055 --> 01:02:34.721
Didn't mean it?

01:02:35.598 --> 01:02:39.435
You don't fuck a girl by accident!

01:02:39.561 --> 01:02:40.602
You don't fuck her!

01:02:40.728 --> 01:02:42.604
- You don't fuck her!
- No.

01:02:44.566 --> 01:02:46.442
He went on all night long.

01:02:46.985 --> 01:02:51.613
Tenoch engaged himself
in an endless quest for details.

01:02:51.739 --> 01:02:55.952
He wanted to make a puzzle with pieces
that wouldn't always match.

01:02:57.662 --> 01:03:01.915
While Julio moulded these details trying
to create a less painful truth.

01:03:21.769 --> 01:03:26.065
Lady Martina gave Luisa the stuffed mouse
with her name on it as a present.

01:03:26.191 --> 01:03:29.776
It had belonged to her great-granddaughter,
Luisa Obregón...

01:03:29.902 --> 01:03:34.323
who died of a heatstroke
while crossing the desert of Arizona...

01:03:34.449 --> 01:03:36.450
Iooking for a better future.

01:03:38.703 --> 01:03:42.206
Luisa believed that
the dead kept being present.

01:03:43.041 --> 01:03:48.087
She wondered how long she would live on
in other people's memories.

01:03:50.507 --> 01:03:53.550
But she didn't want to fill her mind
with thoughts of death.

01:04:07.274 --> 01:04:09.233
The heat has hit you, too?

01:04:18.201 --> 01:04:20.077
A crazy heat.

01:04:21.746 --> 01:04:25.499
Hey, where are you going?

01:04:26.084 --> 01:04:28.460
- Stay here.
- I want to see Rasputin.

01:04:28.586 --> 01:04:30.963
Listen, I don't like the idea.

01:04:32.924 --> 01:04:36.260
You came into my room, Tenoch,
but it might have been Julio just as well.

01:04:36.928 --> 01:04:38.345
Bullshit.

01:04:39.181 --> 01:04:41.807
If you think I'm the driver, fuck yourselves.

01:04:41.934 --> 01:04:43.017
Go fuck off!

01:04:47.189 --> 01:04:48.981
Calm down!

01:04:49.107 --> 01:04:50.482
Fucking pigs!

01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:01.910
Me, me, me, me.

01:05:28.605 --> 01:05:30.731
- The shoes.
- The what?

01:05:30.857 --> 01:05:32.149
Shoes.

01:05:33.818 --> 01:05:36.237
OK, pull them off.
Now...

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:44.911
...this way, this way, this way.

01:05:47.124 --> 01:05:48.124
Come here!

01:05:51.336 --> 01:05:52.836
Give it to me.

01:05:57.175 --> 01:05:59.843
Come, feel me.
Be calm. Quiet.

01:05:59.970 --> 01:06:03.847
Look at me.

01:06:14.692 --> 01:06:16.027
- Wait for me.
- Careful.

01:06:21.658 --> 01:06:23.575
I'm sorry.

01:06:23.701 --> 01:06:24.994
It's all right.

01:06:26.163 --> 01:06:29.790
Luisa, I'm sorry.

01:06:29.916 --> 01:06:30.916
It's just that...

01:06:46.975 --> 01:06:48.767
Hey, don't be that way.

01:06:53.023 --> 01:06:54.898
Wasn't this what you wanted?

01:06:56.068 --> 01:06:58.110
It was your game, right?

01:06:58.236 --> 01:07:00.321
To take me away and screw me?

01:07:01.198 --> 01:07:02.698
Wasn't that it?

01:07:02.824 --> 01:07:04.158
So what?

01:07:06.786 --> 01:07:09.080
I'm stupid.

01:07:09.914 --> 01:07:14.085
You know what I should've done?
Not slept with either of you.

01:07:14.211 --> 01:07:15.877
That's what I should have done.

01:07:17.172 --> 01:07:18.922
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

01:07:20.383 --> 01:07:22.134
Do you believe me?

01:07:23.845 --> 01:07:26.305
- Do you forgive me?
- Yes, yes.

01:07:26.431 --> 01:07:27.806
Let's go.

01:07:42.697 --> 01:07:44.031
Me too.

01:07:44.157 --> 01:07:45.866
- You too, what?
- Julio.

01:07:46.743 --> 01:07:48.160
Me too, arsehole.

01:07:49.079 --> 01:07:52.999
- You too what?
- I fucked your girlfriend, Ceci.

01:07:54.792 --> 01:07:56.752
It's not true.

01:08:00.757 --> 01:08:03.759
- When?
- After the Plastilina Mosh gig.

01:08:03.885 --> 01:08:04.969
Son of a bitch.

01:08:06.138 --> 01:08:09.140
That's why you
brought me home first, right, arsehole?

01:08:14.229 --> 01:08:15.854
- Where?
- My place.

01:08:18.191 --> 01:08:20.109
- Your place?
- In my room.

01:08:20.443 --> 01:08:23.612
- She had flowered knickers.
- You slept with his girlfriend?

01:08:23.738 --> 01:08:26.823
- This arsehole also fucked mine!
- What happened to Three?

01:08:27.533 --> 01:08:30.702
Three: Don't fuck the others' girlfriends.

01:08:30.828 --> 01:08:33.163
That's Five!

01:08:34.124 --> 01:08:35.124
Get out!

01:08:36.209 --> 01:08:39.170
Get out of the car, fucker!
I'm going to rip you in half!

01:08:40.337 --> 01:08:42.756
- Open!
- Hey, guys, stop it!

01:08:43.216 --> 01:08:44.133
Fuck...

01:08:44.259 --> 01:08:47.844
Classic white trash, fucking peasant.

01:08:47.970 --> 01:08:50.721
This fucking peasant
is going to rip your head off!

01:08:50.848 --> 01:08:53.309
- Blow me!
- Get out!

01:08:53.435 --> 01:08:55.519
- Fuck off!
- Snob queer!

01:08:55.770 --> 01:08:57.229
- To hell.
- Julio, listen...

01:08:57.354 --> 01:08:59.064
Son of a bitch!

01:08:59.816 --> 01:09:02.526
You can go fuck yourselves!

01:09:02.652 --> 01:09:03.777
I'm such an idiot!

01:09:03.903 --> 01:09:06.072
I thought you'd be different,
but you're just animals!

01:09:06.198 --> 01:09:08.365
Your Manifesto is a bunch of bullshit!

01:09:08.491 --> 01:09:10.826
Like idiots, breaking your own rules!

01:09:10.953 --> 01:09:16.665
You mark your territory and quarrel
but you just want to screw each other!

01:09:16.791 --> 01:09:18.709
That's what you want!

01:09:19.586 --> 01:09:24.256
Who cares if you screw each other's
women, if you come immediately?

01:09:24.756 --> 01:09:28.885
Play with babies
and you'll end up washing nappies!

01:09:38.354 --> 01:09:40.356
See that, arsehole?

01:09:41.108 --> 01:09:43.359
- Come on, get out, open!
- No.

01:09:43.484 --> 01:09:46.237
- She's leaving.
- You've pushed her.

01:09:46.363 --> 01:09:49.448
How could you fuck my Ceci?

01:09:49.573 --> 01:09:51.408
That slut!

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.246
- So we're even, right?
- Even?

01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:59.959
Even my arse!
Beg forgiveness like I did last night!

01:10:01.086 --> 01:10:02.919
- Come on!
- I'm sorry.

01:10:03.046 --> 01:10:07.299
- On your knees, son of a bitch!
- She's looking for a lift.

01:10:07.425 --> 01:10:09.885
I know, arsehole! On your knees!

01:10:12.264 --> 01:10:13.430
Move away.

01:10:14.432 --> 01:10:17.184
- Move away if you want me to get out.
- Here you go.

01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:19.103
I'm not going to touch you.

01:10:27.279 --> 01:10:28.195
Sorry.

01:10:28.321 --> 01:10:30.156
- On both your knees.
- I'm sorry.

01:10:30.282 --> 01:10:31.282
Sorry for what?

01:10:31.408 --> 01:10:34.576
I'm sorry I fucked your girlfriend Ceci, OK?

01:10:35.495 --> 01:10:37.329
Come on, idiot, she's leaving.

01:10:41.293 --> 01:10:44.461
- How many times did you fuck her?
- Just once, what do you think?

01:10:46.214 --> 01:10:48.799
You're not my charolastra anymore!

01:10:48.925 --> 01:10:52.219
- You don't mean anything to me anymore.
- You neither.

01:10:52.345 --> 01:10:54.471
You're a piece of shit!

01:10:56.599 --> 01:10:59.351
- Come on, Luisa, get in.
- No.

01:10:59.477 --> 01:11:03.940
I'll take a bus to Puerto Escondido!
To hell with you and your Heaven's Mouth.

01:11:04.066 --> 01:11:05.441
We want to go there with you.

01:11:05.567 --> 01:11:08.027
So you can fight like dogs?
No, thanks.

01:11:08.153 --> 01:11:11.488
- We won't fight.
- We promise.

01:11:11.614 --> 01:11:14.450
I don't want to be on a deserted beach
with a pair of arseholes.

01:11:14.576 --> 01:11:18.537
- We've been arseholes.
- We'll do as you say.

01:11:18.663 --> 01:11:20.372
You'll be the boss.

01:11:20.498 --> 01:11:24.918
- We're almost there!
- We're really close!

01:11:26.546 --> 01:11:28.172
If I come, we do things my way.

01:11:29.632 --> 01:11:32.009
One more fight and I'm gone for good.

01:11:32.135 --> 01:11:33.302
Whatever you want.

01:11:33.428 --> 01:11:35.304
Now we play by my rules.

01:11:36.932 --> 01:11:39.016
I'll make my own Manifesto!

01:11:40.435 --> 01:11:41.685
You totally lost it, Julio.

01:11:43.646 --> 01:11:48.400
One: I won't fuck with any of you.
Fuck each other, if you wish.

01:11:49.527 --> 01:11:53.530
Two: I sunbathe naked and I don't want you
sniffing around like dogs.

01:11:54.741 --> 01:11:57.034
Three: I pick the music.

01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:01.163
Four: The moment I ask,
please shut your mouths.

01:12:01.914 --> 01:12:03.958
Five: You cook.

01:12:04.084 --> 01:12:09.046
Six: No stories about your poor girlfriends.

01:12:09.756 --> 01:12:14.718
Seven: If I ask, stay 10 yards from me.
Or better 100.

01:12:15.971 --> 01:12:19.390
Eight: Obviously,
you do all the manual labour.

01:12:20.642 --> 01:12:24.228
Nine: You may not speak of things
you don't agree on.

01:12:25.022 --> 01:12:28.065
Even better, just keep your mouths shut!

01:12:29.192 --> 01:12:31.735
And ten: You're not allowed
to contradict me.

01:12:33.446 --> 01:12:35.322
Much less push me!

01:12:42.372 --> 01:12:45.499
Julio and Tenoch
didn't know where they were...

01:12:45.625 --> 01:12:48.085
or how to get to their destination.

01:12:49.254 --> 01:12:52.589
Saba's directions were contradictory.

01:12:54.217 --> 01:12:59.180
Fearing that Luisa would find out,
Julio turned right, onto a dirt road.

01:14:10.502 --> 01:14:13.462
They thought Luisa was sleeping.

01:14:13.588 --> 01:14:17.049
They didn't know that
her fear prevented her from doing so.

01:14:17.175 --> 01:14:21.553
It had nothing to do with darkness
or with what was surrounding her.

01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:25.136
Hey!

01:16:36.856 --> 01:16:39.316
We got "ceviche"...

01:16:41.319 --> 01:16:45.822
fried fish and beer!

01:16:47.659 --> 01:16:51.912
Jesús Carranza,
known as "Chuy", and his wife Mabel...

01:16:52.039 --> 01:16:55.249
were the fourth generation
of a family of fishermen.

01:16:55.917 --> 01:16:58.835
They lived nearby in San Bernabé,
a nature preserve.

01:17:00.297 --> 01:17:03.840
Chuy offered himself to escort them
to the beaches the next day.

01:17:04.884 --> 01:17:09.513
He asked them 350 pesos,
including lunch.

01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:30.867
- Can I drive?
- No.

01:17:30.994 --> 01:17:34.163
- I know boats, man.
- Go ahead.

01:17:34.289 --> 01:17:36.498
- Just don't go too fast.
- I know boats, man.

01:17:38.876 --> 01:17:41.587
- There! Great swimming beach.
- What's it called?

01:17:41.713 --> 01:17:44.673
- The Heaven's Mouth.
- Very beautiful.

01:17:48.803 --> 01:17:49.886
Whoa...

01:18:04.402 --> 01:18:08.072
Lucero, leave the lady alone!

01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:11.492
It's OK, she's teaching me how to swim.

01:18:12.702 --> 01:18:16.538
- Let me help you.
- It's OK, I got it.

01:18:16.664 --> 01:18:20.584
Go and swim with your friend.
The water is warm.

01:18:26.758 --> 01:18:29.426
Let's see you float like a corpse.

01:18:31.346 --> 01:18:34.306
Whoa, she's really dead...

01:18:34.432 --> 01:18:36.100
Oh, Lucero.

01:18:42.607 --> 01:18:47.653
He's a cry-baby, he whines all night
and wakes up Mummy.

01:18:47.779 --> 01:18:49.613
He only stops in my arms.

01:18:50.782 --> 01:18:55.827
He just likes being with his sister.
So pretty, isn't she?

01:18:55.954 --> 01:18:59.748
She looks a lot like you, Mabel.
Same eyes.

01:18:59.874 --> 01:19:04.503
You should have children, ma'am.
You're good with them.

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:07.006
You're just the right age.

01:19:12.137 --> 01:19:14.638
He fell asleep. What do I do?

01:19:15.307 --> 01:19:16.848
Márquez passes it to Ramón.

01:19:16.975 --> 01:19:19.351
Ramón passes, Zepeda rushes down
along the sideline...

01:19:19.477 --> 01:19:24.023
and the stadium goes wild!

01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:27.859
Claudio the emperor steals the ball.
You can trust him!

01:19:27.986 --> 01:19:30.571
A trustworthy emperor!

01:19:31.406 --> 01:19:35.492
Still waiting for the guest of honour,
the goal!

01:19:36.536 --> 01:19:40.289
Shoot, damn it!

01:19:40.415 --> 01:19:41.790
Here we are.

01:19:42.417 --> 01:19:44.501
A pass to Cuauhtémoc...

01:19:44.627 --> 01:19:47.421
who cuts to the middle towards the goal...

01:19:47.547 --> 01:19:49.548
he shoots and...

01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:54.053
what a save!

01:19:54.179 --> 01:19:56.805
Saved by Campos!

01:19:59.642 --> 01:20:01.978
That's why
he's a regular of the national team!

01:20:02.104 --> 01:20:04.855
That's why!

01:20:07.525 --> 01:20:08.525
What?

01:20:09.611 --> 01:20:10.987
Don't you like Campos?

01:20:25.043 --> 01:20:27.711
Do you ever wish you could live forever?

01:20:27.837 --> 01:20:30.965
- Yes.
- It'd be beautiful.

01:20:33.843 --> 01:20:35.844
Wouldn't it be great?

01:20:43.061 --> 01:20:47.273
At the end of the year, Chuy and his family
will have to leave their home...

01:20:47.399 --> 01:20:51.652
because a new luxury hotel
will rise in San Bernabé.

01:20:52.570 --> 01:20:55.781
They will relocate to the outskirts
of Santa María Colotepec.

01:20:56.491 --> 01:20:59.618
Chuy will attempt to give boat tours...

01:20:59.744 --> 01:21:02.496
but a collective of Acapulco boatmen...

01:21:02.622 --> 01:21:06.667
supported by the local Tourism Board,
will block him.

01:21:07.961 --> 01:21:11.088
Two years later,
he'll end up as a janitor at the hotel.

01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:13.924
He will never fish again.

01:21:19.181 --> 01:21:21.182
- Holy shit.
- What?

01:21:23.101 --> 01:21:24.101
What the hell?

01:21:25.312 --> 01:21:27.271
- Speed up, Chuy!
- Shit.

01:21:28.273 --> 01:21:31.067
Get away from here, you bastards!

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:37.614
Not that way, no!

01:21:39.284 --> 01:21:41.660
- They're shitting inside!
- Get out, bastards!

01:21:49.461 --> 01:21:51.420
- You're throwing shit on me!
- Out!

01:21:55.925 --> 01:21:57.134
Let's go!

01:22:00.973 --> 01:22:02.223
Quick, little shit!

01:22:04.601 --> 01:22:07.228
The pigs rendered the campground
uninhabitable.

01:22:07.895 --> 01:22:12.191
It was late, and Julio and Tenoch
decided to sleep in San Bernabé...

01:22:12.317 --> 01:22:16.988
where Chuy offered them a room
with electricity and water for 75 pesos.

01:22:17.905 --> 01:22:21.575
Luisa looked forward to a shower,
even with cold water.

01:22:22.369 --> 01:22:25.246
They would return the next day
to strike the camp.

01:22:27.582 --> 01:22:30.834
The 23 pigs had escaped
from a nearby ranch.

01:22:31.336 --> 01:22:34.671
Over the next two months,
14 would be slaughtered.

01:22:35.173 --> 01:22:38.050
Three of them would provoke
an outbreak of trichinosis...

01:22:38.176 --> 01:22:42.679
among those who attended
a festival at the Chavarín Ranch.

01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:52.856
Don't spin, arsehole!

01:22:52.983 --> 01:22:55.609
I don't know, Jano,
tell your mother whatever you want.

01:22:57.779 --> 01:23:00.697
Let me talk or I'll hang up.

01:23:01.658 --> 01:23:03.034
OK, thanks.

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:07.579
I would have left anyway,
your confession just made it easier.

01:23:07.705 --> 01:23:09.331
I'm grateful for that.

01:23:09.457 --> 01:23:12.126
This is not a revenge.

01:23:12.252 --> 01:23:16.838
I always knew about your affairs.
With Carmen in Escorial...

01:23:16.965 --> 01:23:21.177
and the one in Barcelona.
I've always known.

01:23:21.303 --> 01:23:24.846
I just hoped you would change, that's all.

01:23:26.224 --> 01:23:29.601
My decision has nothing to do with that.

01:23:29.727 --> 01:23:32.688
I can't explain now,
but soon you'll understand, OK?

01:23:33.898 --> 01:23:38.694
Don't blame yourself
and don't blame me...

01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:41.948
it's nobody's fault.

01:23:43.741 --> 01:23:47.954
No, I don't hate you.
And please, don't hate me.

01:23:49.122 --> 01:23:52.666
Listen, Jano, listen.

01:23:53.251 --> 01:23:56.670
I'm calling to say that I love you,
and that you've been my life.

01:23:58.048 --> 01:24:02.093
I don't expect a happy farewell,
but let it be affectionate, at least.

01:24:04.930 --> 01:24:07.932
Jano, calm down, please.

01:24:12.312 --> 01:24:17.233
Did you notice I hardly took any money?

01:24:17.359 --> 01:24:20.111
No, I have more than I need.

01:24:20.237 --> 01:24:23.948
I left my keys in the kitchen,
with the spare set.

01:24:24.657 --> 01:24:27.784
Don't lose the terrace key,
there's just one copy.

01:24:29.787 --> 01:24:32.289
I took your Ibiza T-shirts.

01:24:32.415 --> 01:24:34.416
You know I like to sleep in them.

01:24:35.793 --> 01:24:39.046
I just hope you learn to be happy.

01:24:40.090 --> 01:24:41.966
I am now.

01:24:42.717 --> 01:24:45.011
Take care, Jano.
I'll hang up now, OK? Bye.

01:24:57.857 --> 01:25:00.776
Fuck you! Rematch!

01:25:08.326 --> 01:25:12.163
I'm grateful to all the women
Jano has betrayed me with.

01:25:12.872 --> 01:25:14.331
How did I notice?

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:19.378
Fucking with him. He tried things on me
that he learned from them.

01:25:19.504 --> 01:25:22.714
- You notice these things.
- Like the finger in the arse, right?

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:24.383
- Yes.
- Come on, really?

01:25:24.509 --> 01:25:27.970
But you must know how to do it.
With delicacy.

01:25:28.096 --> 01:25:31.307
You can't just stick it in.

01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:34.893
Jano was a master of finesse.

01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:37.438
- To the master of finesse!
- To Jano!

01:25:37.564 --> 01:25:39.815
Jano, wherever you are.

01:25:40.943 --> 01:25:44.445
I'm glad I've met you.

01:25:44.571 --> 01:25:48.282
Sometimes you're fuckheads,
but in the end...

01:25:48.408 --> 01:25:51.202
you're pretty cool guys.

01:25:52.537 --> 01:25:56.415
You're so lucky to live in Mexico.

01:25:57.292 --> 01:26:00.919
Look, it breathes with life.
It's great!

01:26:01.046 --> 01:26:04.840
- To the sweet Mexico!
- To Mexico!

01:26:04.967 --> 01:26:05.967
Magic and musical.

01:26:06.093 --> 01:26:09.511
- So, are you friends or not?
- No.

01:26:10.555 --> 01:26:11.973
Come on, make peace.

01:26:13.225 --> 01:26:16.352
- So I'm white trash, arsehole?
- Right that.

01:26:16.478 --> 01:26:20.731
- Do you remember that big thing?
- Fuck, that's my car.

01:26:20.857 --> 01:26:23.025
And I'm some fucking yuppie?

01:26:23.151 --> 01:26:26.988
- OK, a preppie.
- But you love coming to my house!

01:26:27.114 --> 01:26:30.782
Only to get a taste
of what your old man robs.

01:26:30.908 --> 01:26:33.369
Isn't your dad an honest man?

01:26:36.164 --> 01:26:37.581
Isn't he honest?

01:26:41.003 --> 01:26:43.295
What arseholes!
Now you're friends again.

01:26:43.421 --> 01:26:46.798
- To the charolastras!
- To the charolastras!

01:26:46.924 --> 01:26:49.176
- Beer, anyone?
- Make sure they're cold.

01:26:49.302 --> 01:26:50.427
Sure, sure.

01:26:53.848 --> 01:26:55.599
- Luisa.
- What?

01:26:55.725 --> 01:26:58.936
- I'm sorry for the push.
- Oh, Julio.

01:26:59.062 --> 01:27:01.272
- Well, you should be!
- I know.

01:27:01.982 --> 01:27:03.440
Give me a kiss.

01:27:05.152 --> 01:27:06.318
You're forgiven.

01:27:06.861 --> 01:27:08.779
- Hey, Luisa.
- Yes?

01:27:08.905 --> 01:27:10.447
Tell us the truth:

01:27:10.573 --> 01:27:13.825
Who fucks better,
between us? The truth.

01:27:13.952 --> 01:27:16.954
- You make me laugh.
- Come on.

01:27:19.541 --> 01:27:22.251
Despite the fiasco,
you each have your own charms.

01:27:22.377 --> 01:27:24.378
But who made you feel better?

01:27:24.504 --> 01:27:27.839
I'll mimic Tenoch coming:

01:27:27.966 --> 01:27:30.509
"Mamacita! Mamacita!"

01:27:30.635 --> 01:27:35.139
- I don't believe it!
- But Julio, you cross your eyes.

01:27:37.392 --> 01:27:42.521
You both have to quit whacking off
and work up your resistance.

01:27:42.647 --> 01:27:45.816
- I bet he came before me!
- Both of you, stop whacking off.

01:27:45.943 --> 01:27:50.112
- And number Seven?
- Eliminate it.

01:27:51.489 --> 01:27:54.158
Chuy, nothing like tooting
the old horn, eh?

01:27:55.327 --> 01:27:56.994
- To spanking the monkey!
- Yes!

01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:00.581
No, leave the monkeys alone.

01:28:01.333 --> 01:28:03.000
By the way:

01:28:04.461 --> 01:28:06.920
These boys don't know
how to go down on a girl.

01:28:07.047 --> 01:28:10.674
- I didn't do it at all.
- You're surely as naive as he is.

01:28:12.927 --> 01:28:16.513
You were slurping like this was a lollipop.

01:28:16.639 --> 01:28:21.143
You have to be gentle. You have to
make the clitoris your best friend.

01:28:21.269 --> 01:28:24.021
What kind of friend is always hiding?

01:28:24.147 --> 01:28:28.359
Search and you shall find.
The greatest pleasure is giving pleasure.

01:28:28.485 --> 01:28:32.363
- Absolutely. Hail the clit!
- Yes!

01:28:34.449 --> 01:28:37.326
- To the clitoris.
- To the clitoris.

01:28:40.413 --> 01:28:42.539
Listen, seriously...

01:28:43.416 --> 01:28:46.377
Truth, I want the truth:

01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:49.588
Did Ceci blow you?

01:28:49.714 --> 01:28:52.049
The truth?

01:28:52.175 --> 01:28:56.178
- She bites a little.
- She did blow you!

01:28:56.304 --> 01:29:00.266
- Does Ana bite too?
- No, she is really good.

01:29:00.392 --> 01:29:04.395
- You said she didn't blow you!
- Just the tip.

01:29:04.521 --> 01:29:06.647
She missed the main course.

01:29:11.403 --> 01:29:14.530
- Aren't blow jobs great, Chuy?
- Hey, Chuy!

01:29:14.656 --> 01:29:16.991
- To blow jobs!
- Wait.

01:29:17.117 --> 01:29:19.576
Since we're spilling our guts...

01:29:20.578 --> 01:29:24.081
I fucked Ceci a few times.

01:29:26.751 --> 01:29:31.422
No big deal. I poked Ana a bunch of times.

01:29:32.090 --> 01:29:36.010
- Yuck, I've been stirring your vanilla!
- Me too.

01:29:37.637 --> 01:29:42.016
So we're milk brothers!

01:29:49.566 --> 01:29:52.443
He fucked my girl, but he comes in a blink!

01:29:52.569 --> 01:29:57.114
To your girlfriends,
who are having 10 Italians at a time!

01:29:59.242 --> 01:30:00.576
- To Luigi!
- To Francesco!

01:30:00.702 --> 01:30:01.785
To Tiberio!

01:30:02.787 --> 01:30:05.164
- Got any change?
- Who wants the little maggot here?

01:30:05.290 --> 01:30:07.166
I'll take it.

01:30:08.210 --> 01:30:10.211
Hey, Tenoch.

01:30:11.088 --> 01:30:13.797
- And your mother, too, you know?
- What?

01:30:14.049 --> 01:30:16.050
Honestly. The day she cleaned my aura.

01:30:19.304 --> 01:30:20.762
Are you serious?

01:30:21.306 --> 01:30:23.265
Absolutely!

01:30:25.227 --> 01:30:29.313
- Cheers!
- You're mad.

01:30:29.439 --> 01:30:32.108
Luisa! To all mothers!

01:30:37.822 --> 01:30:40.032
Who sings "La Sandunga"?

01:30:40.158 --> 01:30:43.244
- "La Sandunga"?
- Camilo Sesto!

01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:46.788
Wait. Give me a number and a letter.

01:30:47.707 --> 01:30:49.375
Thirteen.

01:30:49.501 --> 01:30:52.169
- Ah... B.
- 13-B.

01:34:23.048 --> 01:34:26.592
Past Heaven's Mouth,
you'll find Palicata Bay...

01:34:26.718 --> 01:34:28.885
and the beaches of Chacrita
and Santa Rita.

01:34:29.304 --> 01:34:32.848
- And Chacagua.
- "Chacagua." What wonderful names.

01:34:32.975 --> 01:34:36.560
- What do they mean?
- I don't know.

01:35:03.796 --> 01:35:06.798
- Good morning, sleepy head.
- Sleepy head.

01:35:06.924 --> 01:35:08.592
Want some eggs?

01:35:10.595 --> 01:35:13.973
- A shrimp soup?
- Please. And a beer.

01:35:14.099 --> 01:35:15.766
The best antidote.

01:35:16.768 --> 01:35:20.104
- I have to give the car back to my sister.
- Fine.

01:35:20.981 --> 01:35:23.732
- Was it Chacue...
- Chacagua.

01:35:23.858 --> 01:35:28.320
- Is there anything after Chacagua?
- There's Amaranto.

01:35:28.446 --> 01:35:31.991
Golden Beach is there.
Huge, with many waves.

01:35:32.117 --> 01:35:35.661
Many people drown there.
But at dusk is wonderful.

01:35:35.787 --> 01:35:37.413
Golden Beach?

01:35:37.539 --> 01:35:40.958
- Some more soup.
- No, thanks.

01:35:41.584 --> 01:35:45.004
I better get going.
My folks will start to worry.

01:35:45.130 --> 01:35:47.839
Julio also has to return the car to his sister.

01:35:48.716 --> 01:35:52.011
I might stay a few days here with Mabel.

01:35:52.137 --> 01:35:55.306
They'll show me some beaches.

01:35:55.432 --> 01:35:58.475
- I'm hungry, Ma.
- Here, have some.

01:36:10.113 --> 01:36:12.156
Go, go!

01:36:25.837 --> 01:36:30.466
At 1pm, Julio and Tenoch
began their journey back home.

01:36:31.009 --> 01:36:33.635
It was a very quiet, uneventful trip.

01:36:34.887 --> 01:36:39.934
Their families never knew
about the trip to the beach with Luisa.

01:36:40.810 --> 01:36:45.439
She stayed behind to begin
her exploration of the local coves.

01:36:48.568 --> 01:36:51.528
The last thing she told
Tenoch and Julio was:

01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:56.450
"Life is like the surf,
so give yourself away like the sea."

01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:18.555
When they returned, Cecilia and Ana
broke up with Tenoch and Julio.

01:37:19.724 --> 01:37:22.935
Two months later,
Tenoch started dating his neighbour.

01:37:23.686 --> 01:37:27.731
Nine months later, Julio started dating a girl
from his French class.

01:37:29.567 --> 01:37:32.236
Julio and Tenoch
stopped seeing each other.

01:37:33.821 --> 01:37:37.699
The following summer, the ruling party
lost the presidential election...

01:37:37.825 --> 01:37:39.868
for the first time in 71 years.

01:37:40.745 --> 01:37:43.039
Julio ran into Tenoch
on the way to the dentist.

01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:48.377
Going for a cup of coffee was easier
than making excuses to avoid it.

01:37:49.754 --> 01:37:53.632
- Have you seen Saba?
- No, but I heard he's living in a hippie town.

01:37:53.758 --> 01:37:55.467
Cool.

01:37:57.012 --> 01:37:58.095
And Daniel?

01:37:59.556 --> 01:38:01.348
Total queen at this point.

01:38:02.517 --> 01:38:04.185
His dad kicked him out.

01:38:07.022 --> 01:38:11.400
- That sucks.
- Nah, the fucker's happy.

01:38:11.526 --> 01:38:13.110
Got a boyfriend and everything.

01:38:13.236 --> 01:38:15.947
That's cool.

01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:20.993
- I got accepted at the University.
- Cool. When do you start?

01:38:21.119 --> 01:38:23.579
- In September.
- Economics?

01:38:24.289 --> 01:38:26.040
Yep.

01:38:26.166 --> 01:38:30.752
- And you?
- Biology at the UAM. Next week.

01:38:30.878 --> 01:38:33.922
- What bad luck, eh?
- Yes. The UAM begins sooner.

01:38:43.558 --> 01:38:45.059
Do you know about Luisa?

01:38:46.979 --> 01:38:48.062
No.

01:38:50.273 --> 01:38:51.648
What?

01:38:51.774 --> 01:38:54.068
- She's dead.
- What the fuck are you saying?

01:38:54.194 --> 01:38:56.946
- Anything else, guys?
- No, thanks.

01:39:00.117 --> 01:39:02.743
- How?
- Cancer.

01:39:03.245 --> 01:39:05.079
She had it everywhere.

01:39:06.581 --> 01:39:10.167
It happened there in San Bernabé.
A month after we left.

01:39:11.169 --> 01:39:12.836
Chuy called Jano. And that's it.

01:39:15.007 --> 01:39:16.757
That's terrible.

01:39:16.883 --> 01:39:19.343
She knew all along.

01:39:21.179 --> 01:39:22.972
She didn't want to tell anyone.

01:39:30.897 --> 01:39:35.026
Luisa spent her last four days
in the Hospital of Santa María Colotepec.

01:39:36.694 --> 01:39:38.029
By her request...

01:39:38.155 --> 01:39:42.574
Chuy and Mabel never mentioned
her adventure with Tenoch and Julio.

01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:47.204
Before dying, she gave Lucero
the little stuffed mouse named Luisa.

01:39:51.043 --> 01:39:52.668
Tenoch excused himself.

01:39:52.794 --> 01:39:55.379
His girlfriend
was waiting for him at the cinema.

01:39:55.505 --> 01:39:57.214
Julio insisted on paying the bill.

01:39:59.176 --> 01:40:00.759
They will never meet again.

01:40:00.885 --> 01:40:02.761
- See you, right?
- Sure.

01:40:18.946 --> 01:40:19.946
The bill, please.
