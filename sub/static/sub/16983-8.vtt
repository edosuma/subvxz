00:01.335 --> 00:03.665
Everything in ancient Egyptian's world

00:03.771 --> 00:06.241
was revolving around these nine gods.

00:07.675 --> 00:10.075
The idea of a council of nine gods

00:10.177 --> 00:12.777
recurs over and over again
throughout history.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.580
It's very possible that there's a group

00:15.683 --> 00:17.383
that oversees Planet Earth.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.315
What is their agenda?

00:19.420 --> 00:23.560
Is it benevolent, or is there
another agenda to control us?

00:23.657 --> 00:26.427
We might never know
their ultimate purpose,

00:26.527 --> 00:28.157
but we should be very, very careful,

00:28.262 --> 00:32.101
because if they don't like
people challenging them,

00:32.198 --> 00:34.029
well, we're doomed.

00:34.135 --> 00:37.365
Since the dawn of civilization,

00:37.471 --> 00:41.571
mankind has credited its origins to gods

00:41.675 --> 00:44.175
and other visitors from the stars.

00:44.278 --> 00:47.048
What if it were true?

00:47.148 --> 00:49.778
Did extraterrestrial beings

00:49.884 --> 00:52.824
really help to shape our history?

00:52.920 --> 00:56.320
And if so, might our planet

00:56.424 --> 00:58.464
still be under the watchful eye

00:58.559 --> 01:01.029
of what some people refer to only

01:01.128 --> 01:03.728
as "The Mysterious Nine"?

# Ancient Aliens 11x08 #
The Mysterious Nine
Original Air Date on July 8, 2016

01:34.128 --> 01:38.228
December 30, 2013.

01:38.332 --> 01:41.732
In an international television
news broadcast,

01:41.836 --> 01:45.636
former Canadian Minister of
National Defense, Paul Hellyer,

01:45.739 --> 01:47.809
makes an astonishing statement.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.638
He claims to have knowledge

01:49.743 --> 01:52.643
that extraterrestrials
are visiting Earth.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.646
Why do you say that UFOs

01:54.748 --> 01:58.778
are as real as the airplanes
flying over our heads?

01:58.886 --> 02:01.416
Well, because I know that they are.

02:01.522 --> 02:05.122
And they've been visiting this
planet for thousands of years.

02:05.226 --> 02:09.056
And there is what is
called a "federation"

02:09.163 --> 02:12.503
of these people, and they have rules.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.240
The interview sent
shockwaves through the media.

02:20.774 --> 02:23.414
Viewers questioned why
a high-level official

02:23.511 --> 02:26.711
would make such an announcement.

02:26.814 --> 02:31.024
Paul Hellyer first came forward in 2005,

02:31.118 --> 02:34.548
but it wasn't until January of 2014

02:34.655 --> 02:37.585
that his story truly went viral.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.391
That gave me the dubious
distinction of being

02:40.494 --> 02:44.404
the first person of cabinet rank
in the G8 group of countries

02:44.498 --> 02:48.098
who ever said categorically,
without reservation,

02:48.202 --> 02:51.502
UFO's are real, and you have
to accept them as being real.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.435
This is difficult territory.

02:53.541 --> 02:56.211
But I understand there's a federation

02:56.310 --> 03:00.150
that is monitoring us most
closely and keeping tabs on us.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.980
Could there be truth
to Hellyer's statements?

03:06.086 --> 03:09.656
Is it possible that there
is a galactic federation

03:09.757 --> 03:13.327
of extraterrestrials overseeing Earth?

03:13.427 --> 03:15.387
But if so, what is the evidence

03:15.496 --> 03:18.426
behind such astounding claims?

03:21.168 --> 03:22.598
Edgewood Arsenal,

03:22.703 --> 03:24.643
Chesapeake Bay, Maryland.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.768
1952.

03:26.874 --> 03:30.384
As part of a secret government program

03:30.477 --> 03:32.437
termed Project Penguin,

03:32.546 --> 03:36.316
medical doctor and psychiatrist
Andrija Puharich

03:36.417 --> 03:38.347
set up a special laboratory

03:38.452 --> 03:40.692
where psychics and military personnel

03:40.788 --> 03:42.148
gathered to investigate

03:42.256 --> 03:43.556
psychological manipulation

03:43.657 --> 03:46.427
and hallucinogenic drugs.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.031
Perhaps one of the most compelling

03:50.130 --> 03:51.600
and controversial aspects

03:51.699 --> 03:54.499
of Puharich's research was channeling,

03:54.602 --> 03:58.602
which involved making contact
with non-physical beings

03:58.706 --> 04:02.206
through the use of psychics.

04:02.309 --> 04:03.609
It's very important that we understand

04:03.711 --> 04:06.481
that this was a serious
scientific endeavor.

04:06.580 --> 04:10.080
No candles or holy water
or any of that was used.

04:10.184 --> 04:13.594
Puharich used the Faraday cage,

04:13.687 --> 04:16.716
a copper room that was
specially insulated

04:16.824 --> 04:18.664
according to US Naval standards,

04:18.759 --> 04:22.429
that would prohibit
mid-level electromagnetic waves

04:22.529 --> 04:24.499
and electrostatic.

04:24.598 --> 04:28.768
In this Faraday cage,
individuals would relax

04:28.869 --> 04:33.469
and allow the mind over matter
signal to take place.

04:37.177 --> 04:40.307
In December, 1952,

04:40.414 --> 04:45.124
Puharich invited Hindu mystic
and doctor D.G. Vinod,

04:45.219 --> 04:48.289
to one of these channeling sessions.

04:48.389 --> 04:52.719
During the experiment,
Vinod went into a deep trance

04:52.826 --> 04:57.326
and made contact with a group
of entities called "The Nine."

04:57.431 --> 04:58.701
At the very beginning,

04:58.799 --> 05:00.169
they just announced themselves

05:00.267 --> 05:02.297
as nine principles of the universe.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.973
Well, that's pretty big to start with,

05:04.071 --> 05:05.341
but nevertheless,

05:05.439 --> 05:07.209
they said they were extraterrestrials.

05:07.308 --> 05:10.538
They were forces from beyond.

05:10.644 --> 05:14.354
The Nine said that they
were an eternal presence,

05:14.448 --> 05:17.448
that they had been watching humanity

05:17.551 --> 05:19.221
from the very beginning.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.620
And that they were gods, guides,

05:22.723 --> 05:26.063
and this was what particularly
interested Puharich.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.390
The idea that if they are gods,

05:28.495 --> 05:30.695
they, of course, have wisdom,

05:30.798 --> 05:34.068
and Puharich wanted to ask for guidance.

05:34.168 --> 05:38.568
The Nine came up with a number
of different messages involving

05:38.672 --> 05:43.312
their being guardians for
the human race, creators even.

05:43.410 --> 05:46.140
Puharich said "What is your name?

05:46.246 --> 05:49.006
"Who are you?"

05:49.116 --> 05:51.516
And that was the great revelation

05:51.618 --> 05:56.018
because the being said, "I am Atum."

05:56.123 --> 06:01.393
And Atum was the great
father god of ancient Egypt,

06:01.495 --> 06:05.525
and introducing not only
the nine principles,

06:05.632 --> 06:09.672
but the nine great gods
or the Ennead of ancient Egypt.

06:12.339 --> 06:16.009
Is it possible that
Puharich actually made contact

06:16.110 --> 06:19.610
with the nine great gods of Egypt?

06:19.713 --> 06:23.153
Could this be evidence of
a long-standing federation

06:23.250 --> 06:28.450
of extraterrestrials
overseeing earthly affairs?

06:28.555 --> 06:33.085
But if so, just who were these beings?

06:35.396 --> 06:38.296
Heliopolis, Cairo.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.399
Known as the Sun City,

06:40.501 --> 06:44.001
this is one of the oldest
and most sacred sites

06:44.104 --> 06:45.774
of ancient Egypt.

06:45.873 --> 06:48.173
Although mostly destroyed,

06:48.275 --> 06:51.205
an obelisk remains, marking the spot

06:51.311 --> 06:55.381
where the temple of the
sun god, Atum, once stood.

06:55.482 --> 06:58.422
Here, the ancient pharaohs

06:58.519 --> 07:00.349
would connect to the Ennead,

07:00.454 --> 07:03.494
a council of nine deities
who were said to have brought

07:03.590 --> 07:06.730
technology and knowledge to mankind.

07:06.827 --> 07:09.957
According to Egyptian hieroglyphs,

07:10.063 --> 07:12.063
consultation with the Ennead

07:12.166 --> 07:14.466
was chief among the pharaohs' duties,

07:14.568 --> 07:17.598
and critical to the
success of the nation.

07:19.573 --> 07:24.183
Heliopolis was the
Vatican of ancient Egypt.

07:24.278 --> 07:28.248
This was the seat,
the helm if you like, the...

07:28.348 --> 07:31.748
the abode of the famous
Ennead, the nine gods

07:31.852 --> 07:35.422
that ruled from the sky,
and governed Egypt

07:35.522 --> 07:38.592
from a place in the sky.

07:39.192 --> 07:42.232
The Ennead started with god Atum,

07:42.329 --> 07:46.059
the god of the solar disc;

07:46.166 --> 07:48.166
god Shu,

07:48.268 --> 07:50.598
the god of the wind,

07:50.704 --> 07:53.744
and goddess Tefnut,

07:53.840 --> 07:56.840
the goddess of the water;

07:56.943 --> 07:58.783
god Geb,

07:58.878 --> 08:01.848
the god of the land,

08:01.948 --> 08:03.448
and goddess Nut,

08:03.550 --> 08:06.650
the goddess of the sky;

08:06.753 --> 08:07.993
Isis,

08:08.088 --> 08:10.488
the mother to all the kings;

08:10.590 --> 08:11.890
god Osiris,

08:11.992 --> 08:14.092
the god of good;

08:14.194 --> 08:15.734
god Set,

08:15.829 --> 08:17.959
the god of evil;

08:18.064 --> 08:20.474
and goddess Nephthys,

08:20.567 --> 08:23.227
the goddess of death.

08:25.238 --> 08:28.668
Everything in ancient Egyptian's world

08:28.775 --> 08:31.905
was revolving around these nine gods.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.109
So, the pharaoh of Egypt

08:35.215 --> 08:38.745
would have to consult with
the nine gods, the Ennead,

08:38.852 --> 08:42.652
with every aspect in life to make sure

08:42.756 --> 08:45.016
he is doing the right thing,

08:45.125 --> 08:47.655
and every ancient Egyptian local,

08:47.761 --> 08:49.891
would have their full trust that

08:49.996 --> 08:54.196
anything coming out
from the mouth of the king

08:54.300 --> 08:56.730
is the word of god

08:56.836 --> 08:59.596
because he already heard it.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.436
The pharaoh was the special

09:01.541 --> 09:03.471
emissary to the gods;

09:03.576 --> 09:05.736
and therefore, the gods
were able to speak

09:05.845 --> 09:07.005
directly through the pharaoh.

09:07.113 --> 09:08.753
A case can be made

09:08.848 --> 09:11.448
that the pharaoh allowing the gods in

09:11.551 --> 09:14.991
to speak through him
is similar to the channeling

09:15.088 --> 09:16.988
that is done through mediums today.

09:17.090 --> 09:20.660
Nine otherworldly beings

09:20.760 --> 09:23.130
speaking through the pharaoh?

09:23.229 --> 09:26.999
Might the modern-day channeling
sessions with the Nine,

09:27.100 --> 09:28.800
conducted during the secret

09:28.902 --> 09:31.942
military experiments in the 1950s,

09:32.038 --> 09:36.608
be mirroring those experienced
by the ancient Egyptians?

09:36.709 --> 09:40.139
The Ennead were actually
extraterrestrial beings

09:40.246 --> 09:43.776
here to administer
and guide human affairs.

09:43.883 --> 09:49.093
The pyramid texts tell us
that Atum came from Sirius.

09:49.189 --> 09:52.489
It's quite fascinating to
contemplate the possibility

09:52.592 --> 09:57.502
that Dr. Puharich was part
of a long line of initiates

09:57.597 --> 09:59.597
who were contacted by the Ennead.

09:59.699 --> 10:01.999
The rulers and the presidents,

10:02.102 --> 10:04.202
and the kings and the queens
throughout history

10:04.304 --> 10:07.974
always have these stories
of consulting higher forces.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.509
Could we still have
these extraterrestrial

10:12.612 --> 10:16.282
or pandimensional overlords
existing today

10:16.382 --> 10:20.822
that are guiding the rulers
of various nations?

10:22.355 --> 10:24.785
Could it really be that Puharich

10:24.891 --> 10:28.191
inadvertently made contact
with the same beings

10:28.294 --> 10:32.534
that were consulted by
the ancient Egyptian pharaohs?

10:32.632 --> 10:36.272
And might these be the extraterrestrials

10:36.369 --> 10:39.239
that former Canadian
Defense Minister Paul Hellyer,

10:39.339 --> 10:41.669
was referring to?

10:41.774 --> 10:45.744
Perhaps more evidence can
be found in numerous accounts

10:45.845 --> 10:48.705
from across the globe of otherworldly

10:48.815 --> 10:50.915
councils of nine.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.592
These extraterrestrial beings,

10:54.687 --> 10:57.557
they're turning up again
and again in human history.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.887
These are gods who are

10:59.993 --> 11:01.663
deeply and fundamentally involved

11:01.761 --> 11:03.061
in humans' lives.

11:05.500 --> 11:06.000
_

11:09.969 --> 11:12.269
Southeast Asia.

11:12.872 --> 11:15.272
Every year during the ninth lunar month

11:15.375 --> 11:16.975
of the Chinese calendar,

11:17.077 --> 11:20.577
thousands of Taoists
throughout the region celebrate

11:20.680 --> 11:23.620
a 2,000-year-old tradition called

11:23.717 --> 11:26.117
The Nine Emperor Gods Festival.

11:30.423 --> 11:33.023
The Nine Emperor Gods Festival
is a very, very important

11:33.126 --> 11:37.726
festival in southeast Asian
Chinese communities...

11:38.765 --> 11:40.025
...and it revolves

11:40.133 --> 11:42.773
around a carnival-like ritual

11:42.869 --> 11:46.569
that takes place for nine full days.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.673
The point of this, uh, festival

11:48.775 --> 11:53.135
is to summon, the very, very
powerful Nine Emperor Gods...

11:54.781 --> 11:55.911
...because they're seen

11:56.016 --> 11:58.446
as residing up in the skies.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.590
The nine Sky Lords are believed

12:05.692 --> 12:09.792
by Taoists to have been
the original rulers of China

12:09.896 --> 12:14.166
and the offspring of the
supreme god of creation.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.569
According to legend,

12:17.671 --> 12:20.671
the Nine Emperor Gods
come from the nine stars

12:20.774 --> 12:22.314
that make up the Big Dipper,

12:22.409 --> 12:24.539
seven of which are visible

12:24.644 --> 12:26.984
and two that are invisible.

12:30.650 --> 12:33.220
They are tasked with
controlling the universe

12:33.320 --> 12:36.150
and keeping order on Earth.

12:39.359 --> 12:42.259
There are typically about
nine spirit mediums who, uh,

12:42.362 --> 12:45.932
enter a trance, and then
channel these gods...

12:46.967 --> 12:48.497
to bring them down

12:48.602 --> 12:51.102
and to keep them very content and happy.

12:51.204 --> 12:54.274
The reason why it's crucial
to keep them happy

12:54.374 --> 12:56.144
is because they keep an account,

12:56.242 --> 12:58.142
a record of everything
that happens on Earth.

12:58.244 --> 13:01.514
They control human destiny.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.775
At the end of the nine days,

13:03.883 --> 13:05.753
when the festival reaches its climax,

13:05.852 --> 13:09.722
the gods eventually return to
the stars from which they came.

13:13.927 --> 13:18.157
Curiously, this idea
of nine gods, or overlords,

13:18.264 --> 13:21.504
watching over Earth
can be found in cultures

13:21.601 --> 13:23.031
throughout the world.

13:24.938 --> 13:27.008
The Aztecs of Meso-America

13:27.107 --> 13:29.137
were known to worship nine gods

13:29.242 --> 13:32.182
called the Lords of the Night.

13:34.014 --> 13:38.054
In the Norse tradition,
nine gods survive the Ragnarok,

13:38.151 --> 13:39.881
or earthly destruction.

13:41.855 --> 13:45.915
According to Buddhist legend,
the Emperor Ashoka consulted

13:46.026 --> 13:50.186
with a secret society
called the Nine Unknown Men

13:50.296 --> 13:53.826
who were said to possess
the knowledge of the universe.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.495
The ancient Etruscans of Italy

13:57.604 --> 13:59.674
also believed in nine gods

13:59.773 --> 14:04.013
that could be persuaded to
influence the fate of mankind.

14:06.146 --> 14:10.146
And in Greek mythology,
Zeus led a council of nine gods

14:10.250 --> 14:13.150
created to oversee humanity.

14:15.889 --> 14:19.619
The canonical Olympian gods
are imagined to be about 12,

14:19.726 --> 14:22.886
and they have a sort of
governing body as well,

14:22.996 --> 14:25.526
and so they have a council.

14:25.632 --> 14:28.972
For the most part, the nine
most important gods are there

14:29.069 --> 14:31.599
sitting at the top of that is Zeus.

14:31.705 --> 14:35.165
These make up the-the power
structure of the heavens.

14:35.275 --> 14:38.905
And they occasionally meet to determine

14:39.012 --> 14:41.882
what they're going to do about mankind.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.123
Zeus created the Council of Nine,

14:46.219 --> 14:51.219
and this was Aphrodite, Apollo,
Athena, Demeter, Hephaestus,

14:51.324 --> 14:55.334
Hera, Hermes, Poseidon and Zeus himself.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.831
And these are the gods
that then could interact

14:59.933 --> 15:02.373
with humans, I guess to keep us in line.

15:07.006 --> 15:10.876
These are gods who are deeply
and fundamentally involved

15:10.977 --> 15:13.437
in humans' lives,
and the gods occasionally

15:13.546 --> 15:15.606
have to clean things up,

15:15.715 --> 15:18.675
and so, there's a few times
in the mythological tradition

15:18.785 --> 15:20.445
we hear about the gods deciding,

15:20.553 --> 15:22.453
rather like we hear in Genesis,

15:22.555 --> 15:24.455
that they're gonna wipe the slate clean

15:24.557 --> 15:28.587
and just start new entirely
with a brand new human race.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.897
Is it purely coincidence

15:32.999 --> 15:35.129
that so many ancient cultures,

15:35.235 --> 15:37.795
separated by thousands of miles,

15:37.904 --> 15:41.574
all worship a group of nine gods?

15:42.842 --> 15:43.882
And could it be

15:43.977 --> 15:46.537
that these beings were not gods,

15:46.646 --> 15:48.806
but extraterrestrial visitors

15:48.915 --> 15:51.915
as ancient astronaut theorists believe?

15:52.018 --> 15:55.018
Visitors that are working
behind the scenes

15:55.121 --> 15:58.861
and still watching over us today?

15:58.958 --> 16:01.988
I'm always asked about
ancient astronauts.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.525
Why did they leave?

16:03.630 --> 16:04.960
How come they're not here anymore?

16:05.064 --> 16:08.504
And personally,
I never said that they left.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.971
I think they've arrived,
and they've stayed.

16:11.070 --> 16:14.810
And so that plays into the whole idea

16:14.908 --> 16:17.878
that we are this ongoing project

16:17.977 --> 16:21.507
by extraterrestrial species,

16:21.614 --> 16:22.854
and that they are observing us--

16:22.949 --> 16:25.519
have observed us, from afar.

16:25.618 --> 16:28.688
Because according to
the creation stories,

16:28.788 --> 16:31.188
we are their offspring.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.921
So if the council exists,

16:33.026 --> 16:37.156
they are here to observe their creation.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.933
The idea of a council of gods,

16:43.036 --> 16:44.996
especially nine gods,

16:45.104 --> 16:47.514
recurs over and over again
throughout history.

16:47.607 --> 16:51.077
People today claim
that they're in contact

16:51.177 --> 16:53.077
with a divine council.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.909
When you look at this,
you have to ask,

16:56.015 --> 16:59.175
is it possible that these are
actually the same group

16:59.285 --> 17:01.045
of extraterrestrial beings

17:01.154 --> 17:04.493
that are turning up again
and again in human history?

17:04.590 --> 17:06.991
And that in fact,
they may have a long-term

17:07.093 --> 17:09.292
or long-range plan for humanity.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.160
Might it be that these nine gods

17:13.266 --> 17:16.726
found across various cultures
throughout the globe,

17:16.836 --> 17:19.896
are in fact the same beings?

17:20.006 --> 17:22.435
And if so, does this give credibility

17:22.541 --> 17:24.912
to the claims of contact

17:25.011 --> 17:29.881
during military experiments
conducted in the 1950s?

17:32.818 --> 17:34.588
All around the world,

17:34.687 --> 17:37.387
in a remarkably cross-cultural way,

17:37.490 --> 17:40.290
we get the Nine.

17:40.393 --> 17:44.633
And when Puharich started channeling,

17:44.730 --> 17:46.360
the Nine cropped up again.

17:46.465 --> 17:48.095
Coincidence?

17:48.200 --> 17:49.970
Or was he accessing something

17:50.069 --> 17:52.539
that has been with us
since the dawn of time?

17:54.373 --> 17:57.513
Does this notion of
an otherworldly council of nine,

17:57.610 --> 18:01.350
that is found in so
many ancient cultures,

18:01.447 --> 18:05.247
provide proof that there
really are alien overlords

18:05.351 --> 18:09.251
that have been steering
the course of humanity?

18:09.355 --> 18:12.955
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

18:13.058 --> 18:15.528
and claim that, incredibly,

18:15.628 --> 18:19.228
physical evidence of this
can be found, not on Earth,

18:19.331 --> 18:22.431
but circling high above it.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.067
Coming up...

18:26.172 --> 18:27.342
This is something

18:27.440 --> 18:29.540
that has a dark, streamlined,

18:29.642 --> 18:31.312
technological appearance.

18:31.410 --> 18:34.710
This is an extraterrestrial satellite

18:34.814 --> 18:37.114
that has been monitoring Planet Earth.

18:39.500 --> 18:40.000
_

18:43.662 --> 18:46.262
December, 1998.

18:48.134 --> 18:51.044
During the assembly of the
International Space Station,

18:51.137 --> 18:55.267
U.S. astronauts spot
a large unidentified item

18:55.375 --> 18:56.605
orbiting the earth.

18:58.344 --> 19:01.084
They take photographs
of the mysterious object,

19:01.180 --> 19:04.350
and post them on the NASA website.

19:05.651 --> 19:06.751
When you actually look

19:06.819 --> 19:08.719
at the photographs of the object,

19:08.821 --> 19:11.621
it very obviously looks artificial.

19:11.724 --> 19:13.624
This is not a meteor.

19:13.726 --> 19:15.786
This is not a chunk of rock.

19:17.196 --> 19:18.596
This is something that has

19:18.664 --> 19:22.574
a dark, streamlined,
technological appearance,

19:22.635 --> 19:25.235
almost like some of the stealth
aircraft that we've built,

19:25.338 --> 19:29.908
with a kind of bent nose in the
front, sort of like a hawk.

19:33.646 --> 19:35.106
Curiously,

19:35.181 --> 19:38.521
NASA officials quickly
remove the photos,

19:38.618 --> 19:41.788
and claim the object was space debris--

19:41.888 --> 19:44.158
most likely a thermal blanket,

19:44.257 --> 19:48.227
inadvertently released
from the space station.

19:48.294 --> 19:52.334
But some independent researchers
are not convinced,

19:52.398 --> 19:55.468
and suggest that it might
be the latest evidence

19:55.568 --> 19:57.398
of the "Black Knight" satellite

19:57.470 --> 19:59.470
that first made headlines

19:59.572 --> 20:02.342
three years before
the first man-made satellite

20:02.442 --> 20:05.112
was launched into orbit.

20:05.211 --> 20:10.181
In 1954, both The San Francisco Examiner

20:10.283 --> 20:12.253
and the Aviation Week Journal

20:12.318 --> 20:15.388
published articles detailing
what appeared to be

20:15.488 --> 20:21.728
artificial satellites
orbiting the earth.

20:21.828 --> 20:23.758
It really shocked a lot of people,

20:23.863 --> 20:26.703
because although the concept
of satellites were known,

20:26.766 --> 20:29.726
nobody on the planet
was flying a satellite.

20:30.770 --> 20:32.470
The story really takes off

20:32.572 --> 20:34.512
with a man named
Major Donald Keyhoe.

20:34.607 --> 20:37.067
He was formerly with the U.S. military,

20:37.143 --> 20:39.743
and wrote a number of books on UFOs.

20:41.314 --> 20:43.754
One of the things that
Keyhoe wrote about

20:43.850 --> 20:47.180
was how supposedly a number of
military insiders had told him,

20:47.286 --> 20:48.816
that the U.S. military

20:48.921 --> 20:52.521
was tracking one or two
unknown satellites

20:52.592 --> 20:55.162
of extraordinary size in Earth orbit.

20:55.228 --> 20:56.858
Nobody knew what they were.

20:56.963 --> 20:58.463
This was long before Sputnik,

20:58.564 --> 21:00.364
the first satellite launched
by the Russians.

21:00.433 --> 21:06.203
And it gave rise to the idea
that it was extraterrestrial.

21:09.509 --> 21:11.739
The United States Department of Defense

21:11.844 --> 21:14.484
was said to have
recruited the assistance

21:14.580 --> 21:18.280
of astronomer Clyde W. Tombaugh, in 1953,

21:18.351 --> 21:20.821
to identify this strange object.

21:20.887 --> 21:26.587
However, his conclusions
were never made public.

21:26.692 --> 21:30.532
Based on its appearance
on radar in the 1960s,

21:30.630 --> 21:33.330
scientists estimated
that the mystery satellite

21:33.432 --> 21:36.172
weighed over ten tons.

21:36.269 --> 21:39.099
It was not only several times larger

21:39.172 --> 21:41.272
than anything worldwide space programs

21:41.340 --> 21:42.710
were capable of launching,

21:42.808 --> 21:45.478
but it also seemed to be traveling

21:45.545 --> 21:47.305
in an artificial orbit,

21:47.413 --> 21:51.453
circling the earth from pole to pole.

21:55.188 --> 21:57.218
The Black Knight is said
to be in a polar orbit,

21:57.323 --> 21:58.593
which is what you would do

21:58.691 --> 22:00.591
if you wanted to cover
the entire Planet Earth

22:00.693 --> 22:02.093
as it rotated underneath you.

22:02.195 --> 22:05.125
Weather satellites, spy satellites

22:05.231 --> 22:06.731
are commonly put into this polar orbit

22:06.832 --> 22:09.102
in order to cover the entire
surface of the earth.

22:09.168 --> 22:12.638
This implies that it
is an unnatural object.

22:15.741 --> 22:18.281
What's particularly intriguing
about this satellite

22:18.377 --> 22:20.477
is it's not one of ours.

22:20.546 --> 22:22.046
In other words, the theory is

22:22.148 --> 22:25.448
that this is an
extraterrestrial satellite

22:25.551 --> 22:28.621
that has perhaps been
monitoring Planet Earth

22:28.721 --> 22:31.391
for thousands of years.

22:33.726 --> 22:37.426
In the 1930s ham radio operators

22:37.530 --> 22:42.200
claimed they were picking up
radio signals from outer space.

22:42.301 --> 22:44.801
And Nikola Tesla himself claimed

22:44.904 --> 22:49.074
that he was picking up
radio signals from Mars.

22:49.175 --> 22:50.605
So you have to wonder,

22:50.710 --> 22:53.810
were ham radio operators
and even Nikola Tesla,

22:53.913 --> 22:55.653
somehow picking up signals

22:55.748 --> 22:59.848
from this extraterrestrial
ship orbiting our planet?

23:02.188 --> 23:03.518
A ham radio operator

23:03.623 --> 23:05.823
was able to decipher this signal,

23:05.925 --> 23:09.225
and create a matrix grid
of individual dots

23:09.295 --> 23:11.425
that were either white or black.

23:11.497 --> 23:13.197
When he looked at this grid,

23:13.299 --> 23:14.699
he concluded that it was a map

23:14.767 --> 23:17.567
of the Epsilon Bootes constellation,

23:17.670 --> 23:20.140
positioned where it would have been

23:20.206 --> 23:22.666
13,000 years ago.

23:26.145 --> 23:28.045
Might this mysterious object

23:28.147 --> 23:32.417
actually have traveled
to earth 13,000 years ago?

23:32.485 --> 23:36.385
And if so, was it put into orbit

23:36.489 --> 23:40.719
by extraterrestrials
in order to observe Earth?

23:40.826 --> 23:44.326
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

23:44.430 --> 23:48.630
and suggest that descriptions
of an extraterrestrial satellite

23:48.701 --> 23:52.671
can even be found
thousands of years ago,

23:52.772 --> 23:58.382
in the Hebrew text known
as the "Apocalypse of Baruch".

24:01.881 --> 24:04.081
The Apocalypse of Baruch

24:04.150 --> 24:06.620
is one of the best
ancient astronaut stories

24:06.686 --> 24:09.086
in existence,

24:09.155 --> 24:11.115
because it describes

24:11.223 --> 24:14.023
an eyewitness account of a satellite

24:14.126 --> 24:15.356
orbiting the earth.

24:15.428 --> 24:17.028
Baruch describes

24:17.129 --> 24:20.599
how he sees a magnificent bird

24:20.700 --> 24:24.270
that watched the
happenings on the planet.

24:24.337 --> 24:26.597
And from time to time this bird

24:26.706 --> 24:29.166
would extend its wings

24:29.241 --> 24:33.781
to glean or to gather
the power of the sun.

24:33.879 --> 24:38.219
And after flying around,
that bird would be so exhausted

24:38.317 --> 24:41.317
it would retract its wings.

24:41.420 --> 24:44.320
If we look at today's
satellites in space,

24:44.423 --> 24:46.423
it's the same story.

24:46.525 --> 24:49.655
We have solar cells on
wings that can extend,

24:49.729 --> 24:51.759
and then they can retract at will.

24:51.864 --> 24:55.374
So what if Baruch witnessed
something similar?

24:57.269 --> 24:59.169
Baruch himself said

24:59.271 --> 25:01.911
that this is
"the guardian of the earth."

25:05.444 --> 25:07.544
Might the mythological bird

25:07.646 --> 25:10.306
described in the
Apocalypse of Baruch

25:10.416 --> 25:14.046
have actually been an
observational satellite?

25:14.153 --> 25:18.163
Could this be proof
that extraterrestrials

25:18.257 --> 25:22.227
have been keeping watch over
Earth for thousands of years,

25:22.328 --> 25:25.728
as some ancient astronaut
theorists suggest?

25:25.831 --> 25:29.731
And if so, do they pose a threat?

25:29.835 --> 25:32.735
Perhaps additional clues can be found

25:32.838 --> 25:36.338
by exploring the rumors
of an alien encounter...

25:36.442 --> 25:38.742
at the White House.

25:42.181 --> 25:44.281
He wanted to meet with
President Eisenhower.

25:44.383 --> 25:46.783
So they took him to the Oval Office.

25:46.886 --> 25:49.146
He was brought to the president

25:49.255 --> 25:51.255
and the vice president, and they put him

25:51.357 --> 25:52.657
on VIP status for three years.

25:55.500 --> 25:56.000
_

25:57.405 --> 26:01.365
Washington D.C., 1957.

26:01.942 --> 26:04.642
A federal marshal and chaplain

26:04.712 --> 26:07.952
who had top-secret security
clearance at the Pentagon,

26:08.049 --> 26:09.949
Dr. Frank Stranges,

26:10.051 --> 26:12.821
is introduced to an
extraterrestrial being

26:12.920 --> 26:14.820
named Valiant Thor,

26:14.889 --> 26:17.819
who is secretly working with
the United States government.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.960
Stranges later goes public

26:22.063 --> 26:23.763
with the shocking allegations

26:23.865 --> 26:25.225
in his groundbreaking book,

26:25.333 --> 26:28.273
Stranger at the Pentagon.

26:31.172 --> 26:33.112
Dr. Frank Stranges said that

26:33.174 --> 26:36.244
on March 16, 1957,

26:36.344 --> 26:40.784
Valiant Thor arrived in a scout ship,

26:40.882 --> 26:43.282
which landed in Alexandria, Virginia

26:43.384 --> 26:45.994
in an agricultural field at 8:00 a.m.

26:46.087 --> 26:48.947
The police were the first on the scene.

26:49.023 --> 26:51.663
And they had a conversation with him.

26:51.759 --> 26:54.789
He wanted to meet with
President Eisenhower.

26:54.896 --> 26:57.196
So they took him through the Pentagon

26:57.298 --> 26:59.768
where he met with the
Secretary of Defense.

26:59.834 --> 27:02.174
Once that was cleared,

27:02.270 --> 27:04.940
they brought him over
to the Oval Office to meet

27:05.039 --> 27:08.739
with Eisenhower, Nixon,
and all the joint chiefs.

27:10.745 --> 27:14.045
Stranges' account was
backed up by Harley Byrd,

27:14.115 --> 27:16.775
the nephew of Admiral Richard E. Byrd,

27:16.851 --> 27:19.151
who worked for the Department of Defense

27:19.220 --> 27:22.920
from 1957 to 1963.

27:24.392 --> 27:27.062
Byrd was assigned to Project Blue Book,

27:27.128 --> 27:32.198
the secret military program
that investigated UFO reports.

27:32.300 --> 27:35.130
And he wrote the foreword
to Stranges' book.

27:38.004 --> 27:39.474
There have been face-to-face meetings

27:39.573 --> 27:41.113
between United States officials

27:41.207 --> 27:45.207
and people from other
star systems. Period.

27:45.312 --> 27:47.982
The best evidence that I think there is,

27:48.048 --> 27:50.918
is the case of Valiant Thor

27:51.017 --> 27:53.587
and his visit to the, uh,
capital in the U.S.

27:53.687 --> 27:58.457
He remained in the United States
for three years.

27:58.558 --> 28:00.828
And did a multitude of things there.

28:00.927 --> 28:03.127
Communicating with various people

28:03.229 --> 28:05.999
and discussing the state of
affairs in the United States

28:06.099 --> 28:07.499
and in the cosmos.

28:08.969 --> 28:10.639
According to accounts,

28:10.737 --> 28:14.507
Valiant Thor had been sent
to Earth by the High Council

28:14.608 --> 28:18.708
to intervene on behalf of the
intergalactic community.

28:21.681 --> 28:23.581
They were worried because
our nuclear capabilities

28:23.683 --> 28:28.153
had become an interstellar concern.

28:28.254 --> 28:30.824
The story goes that
Valiant Thor had contact

28:30.890 --> 28:35.460
with high level members
of the U.S. government

28:35.528 --> 28:38.628
and the military including
the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

28:38.698 --> 28:41.528
essentially giving a friendly
warning that, hey,

28:41.601 --> 28:43.941
if you don't disarm
your nuclear weapons,

28:44.037 --> 28:45.737
and if the Russians don't,

28:45.805 --> 28:48.835
it's all gonna end in complete
destruction for everybody

28:48.942 --> 28:50.942
and the obliteration of the human race.

28:51.044 --> 28:55.514
And Thor wasn't some sort of
bullying-type character.

28:55.615 --> 28:58.675
He wanted the people
of Earth to understand

28:58.785 --> 29:00.885
and take action themselves,

29:00.987 --> 29:02.647
rather than being forced into it.

29:02.722 --> 29:06.462
The story actually sounds
quite like the scenario

29:06.526 --> 29:09.056
presented in the 1951 movie,

29:09.162 --> 29:11.462
The Day the Earth Stood Still.

29:11.531 --> 29:13.871
Very, very similar scenario.

29:16.002 --> 29:19.702
As outlandish as the claims seem to be,

29:19.806 --> 29:23.676
photographs have surfaced of
Thor meeting with top officials

29:23.777 --> 29:27.677
and no one has stepped
forward to dispute them.

29:27.781 --> 29:31.081
Even members of
President Eisenhower's family,

29:31.184 --> 29:33.824
including his great granddaughter,
Laura Eisenhower,

29:33.920 --> 29:36.950
insist the story is true.

29:38.057 --> 29:42.487
Valiant Thor supposedly
showed up around 1957,

29:42.562 --> 29:44.162
and was brought to the president
and the vice president,

29:44.264 --> 29:46.634
and they put him on
VIP status for three years.

29:47.801 --> 29:49.801
And Eisenhower really wanted

29:49.903 --> 29:52.203
to let humanity know about this,

29:52.272 --> 29:54.672
but, the secretary of defense,

29:54.741 --> 29:58.141
the head of the Central
Intelligence Agency,

29:58.211 --> 30:01.011
and the military Joint Chiefs
of Staff opposed it.

30:01.114 --> 30:05.584
And even though Eisenhower was
intent on having a meeting

30:05.652 --> 30:07.222
with the General Assembly
of the United Nations,

30:07.287 --> 30:12.517
in order to present the story
to them, that was shut down too.

30:12.625 --> 30:15.185
Ultimately his mission,

30:15.295 --> 30:19.555
which was on behalf of the
federation, was not taken up.

30:19.666 --> 30:20.896
His mission was aborted.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.570
He didn't accomplish what he came for,

30:24.671 --> 30:26.801
because the decision was made--

30:26.906 --> 30:30.536
not by the president himself--
but it was made by people

30:30.643 --> 30:34.253
like the secretary
of defense, and the CIA.

30:34.314 --> 30:37.584
And this, I think, was a
turning point in the history

30:37.684 --> 30:40.494
of the United States and the world.

30:40.587 --> 30:44.657
We had an opportunity then
to change our ways,

30:44.758 --> 30:47.958
and we missed the opportunity.

30:48.027 --> 30:50.657
We blew it, to put it bluntly.

30:51.764 --> 30:53.604
What's very interesting here

30:53.666 --> 30:56.966
in terms of Valiant Thor's
timing was whether or not

30:57.036 --> 31:00.566
this was something that
was part of a larger plan,

31:00.673 --> 31:03.743
whether there are these
overlords who are there

31:03.843 --> 31:06.043
behind the scenes controlling humanity.

31:06.146 --> 31:08.876
Valiant Thor claimed
that he had been sent

31:08.948 --> 31:12.518
by a high council to talk to

31:12.585 --> 31:14.615
the military leaders of Earth

31:14.687 --> 31:16.547
and warn them of

31:16.656 --> 31:20.986
the dangers of nuclear weapons.

31:22.560 --> 31:25.500
And you have to wonder...
is Valiant Thor

31:25.598 --> 31:29.468
some kind of representative
of this Council of Nine

31:29.569 --> 31:33.599
that's watching over planet Earth

31:33.706 --> 31:35.336
that Puharich had been talking about?

31:40.579 --> 31:43.579
Is it conceivable that
an extraterrestrial emissary

31:43.649 --> 31:45.349
for a Council of Nine

31:45.451 --> 31:49.491
really made contact with
the United States government?

31:49.588 --> 31:55.188
And if so, was his mission
ultimately a failure?

31:55.294 --> 31:58.104
Ancient astronaut theorists suggest

31:58.197 --> 32:01.367
that perhaps the
Mysterious Nine succeeded

32:01.467 --> 32:03.397
in delivering a message to mankind

32:03.502 --> 32:06.272
through other, more receptive channels.

32:10.543 --> 32:12.243
Science fiction

32:12.311 --> 32:16.451
is preparing people for final contact.

32:16.549 --> 32:18.479
Gene Roddenberry sat in

32:18.584 --> 32:20.384
and could ask questions of

32:20.486 --> 32:21.786
the Council of Nine.

32:23.500 --> 32:24.000
_

32:26.709 --> 32:30.109
Ossining, New York. 1958.

32:30.212 --> 32:34.452
After his initial contact with the Nine,

32:34.550 --> 32:36.520
Dr. Andrija Puharich creates

32:36.619 --> 32:40.389
the Roundtable Foundation
at his private estate.

32:42.224 --> 32:44.024
Various psychics and mediums

32:44.126 --> 32:45.956
are invited to channel

32:46.062 --> 32:48.332
the self-proclaimed Egyptian deities

32:48.431 --> 32:50.561
for a group of influential observers.

32:52.268 --> 32:55.468
Puharich just simply carried on

32:55.571 --> 32:58.371
investigating psychic abilities.

32:58.474 --> 33:00.544
His idea almost certainly
from the the beginning,

33:00.643 --> 33:03.313
was to hook, uh, big names,

33:03.412 --> 33:05.912
movers and shakers, writers,

33:06.015 --> 33:10.445
people who could ensure
that the message of the Nine

33:10.553 --> 33:13.223
reached the top layer of society,

33:13.322 --> 33:15.622
but who could be trusted
with a big secret.

33:15.725 --> 33:19.185
Among the participants in these
meetings were Warren McCulloch,

33:19.295 --> 33:21.555
who was an early pioneer in cybernetics.

33:21.664 --> 33:26.034
Another was John J. Hammond,
who was considered to be

33:26.135 --> 33:28.135
the student of Nikola Tesla.

33:28.237 --> 33:31.707
Henry A. Wallace, President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt's

33:31.807 --> 33:34.537
secretary of agriculture
and third term VP,

33:34.643 --> 33:37.143
was also a participant
in these meetings.

33:37.246 --> 33:39.706
Ultimately, they appeared
to be deeply interested

33:39.815 --> 33:42.245
in how the human mind can connect

33:42.351 --> 33:44.751
with the extraterrestrial mind.

33:46.789 --> 33:49.589
One observer of the
Roundtable Foundation,

33:49.692 --> 33:52.992
according to his writing
assistant Jon Povill,

33:53.095 --> 33:57.295
was future Star Trek
creator Gene Roddenberry.

33:57.400 --> 34:00.370
Povill claims Roddenberry actively

34:00.469 --> 34:02.299
participated in the sessions,

34:02.405 --> 34:05.565
and that parts of the Star Trek
television series

34:05.674 --> 34:08.284
may not be Roddenberry's work at all,

34:08.377 --> 34:14.077
but directly inspired
by the Mysterious Nine.

34:14.183 --> 34:16.422
Of all of the famous guests,

34:16.518 --> 34:21.089
Gene Roddenberry was one
of the most gifted,

34:21.190 --> 34:23.690
and was a part of our team,

34:23.793 --> 34:26.362
taking notes and scoring information

34:26.462 --> 34:29.931
that he felt would eventually
be used worldwide.

34:30.032 --> 34:34.202
What is exciting is some
of what Gene saw there

34:34.303 --> 34:36.043
in our work together

34:36.138 --> 34:41.007
was produced in some
of the episodes of Star Trek.

34:41.110 --> 34:44.210
Gene Roddenberry sat in
and could ask questions

34:44.313 --> 34:46.612
of the psychics who were communicating

34:46.715 --> 34:48.275
with the Council of Nine.

34:48.384 --> 34:51.094
And I think this is where
you get various ideas

34:51.187 --> 34:55.217
such as teleportation, warp drive.

34:55.324 --> 34:57.624
In Star Trek, they have the Federation,

34:57.726 --> 35:01.156
and the Federation is
responsible for governing

35:01.263 --> 35:03.603
planets all throughout the universe.

35:03.699 --> 35:06.429
That's very possible that
it's happening here,

35:06.535 --> 35:10.165
that there's a group
that oversees Planet Earth.

35:10.272 --> 35:12.612
This higher power within the universe

35:12.708 --> 35:15.538
that is monitoring things on Earth.

35:15.644 --> 35:17.314
I don't think there's any doubt

35:17.413 --> 35:19.153
about the Federation being real.

35:19.248 --> 35:21.378
This is something that I've
heard since I first became

35:21.484 --> 35:24.054
interested in the subject of ufology.

35:24.153 --> 35:28.523
And I've talked to hundreds
of people who have had contacts,

35:28.624 --> 35:32.094
direct or indirect,
with various individuals

35:32.194 --> 35:34.504
from one or more of the planets

35:34.597 --> 35:38.027
that are members of the Federation.

35:42.138 --> 35:43.968
Set in the future,

35:44.073 --> 35:47.173
Star Trek chronicled
a peaceful scientific mission

35:47.276 --> 35:49.636
to seek out and explore other planets

35:49.745 --> 35:52.675
in the Milky Way galaxy.

35:53.781 --> 35:57.381
Among the futuristic concepts
revealed in the series,

35:57.486 --> 36:00.946
is the Federation's Prime Directive--

36:01.056 --> 36:04.886
their guiding principle that
prohibits them with interfering

36:04.994 --> 36:09.064
with the development of
a still evolving civilization.

36:09.165 --> 36:12.895
Researchers studying the
Mysterious Nine have concluded

36:13.002 --> 36:17.202
that they may function
in much the same way.

36:19.475 --> 36:21.335
Roddenberry heard about

36:21.443 --> 36:24.653
the Prime Directive from these sessions.

36:24.747 --> 36:26.347
Now, what is the Prime Directive?

36:26.448 --> 36:29.578
It's the idea that an
extraterrestrial race

36:29.685 --> 36:32.915
should not just show up
and announce its identity

36:33.022 --> 36:35.322
to a fledging planet
that has not yet achieved

36:35.424 --> 36:37.124
interstellar travel.

36:37.226 --> 36:41.426
An extraterrestrial group
is not going to make themselves

36:41.530 --> 36:45.430
openly known until that
society is ready for it,

36:45.534 --> 36:49.204
meaning until their development
has naturally steered them

36:49.305 --> 36:53.105
in favor of the idea
of extraterrestrial life,

36:53.209 --> 36:55.079
so it wouldn't come as a great surprise,

36:55.177 --> 36:57.677
and it wouldn't overly
disrupt their existing

36:57.780 --> 37:00.050
social and political order.

37:01.750 --> 37:05.290
If we are being monitored
by extraterrestrials,

37:05.387 --> 37:08.557
it seems to be that one reason
why they don't openly land

37:08.657 --> 37:11.527
on the White House lawn,
is something very much like

37:11.627 --> 37:13.157
the Prime Directive.

37:14.262 --> 37:15.932
I think the Prime Directive

37:16.031 --> 37:18.901
is that they are not
to interfere with us.

37:19.001 --> 37:21.901
That we were given the power of choice.

37:22.004 --> 37:23.674
And so that they have to let us

37:23.772 --> 37:27.112
exercise that choice
which the creator gave us,

37:27.209 --> 37:29.609
even though we often choose very badly.

37:29.712 --> 37:32.282
Make the wrong decisions.

37:32.381 --> 37:36.921
That is our legacy.
We're allowed to do that.

37:37.019 --> 37:39.319
Is it possible that the nine

37:39.421 --> 37:43.921
extraterrestrial overlords
don't want to directly

37:44.026 --> 37:46.426
interfere in our society,

37:46.528 --> 37:51.328
but to guide us from behind the scenes?

37:51.933 --> 37:55.703
You have to wonder
if there's not some truth

37:55.804 --> 37:57.044
to science fiction

37:57.139 --> 38:00.709
and television and movies and books,

38:00.809 --> 38:03.379
are a way of preparing

38:03.478 --> 38:06.748
people of the Earth for what's coming.

38:08.550 --> 38:10.150
Might there actually be

38:10.252 --> 38:14.722
some galactic truths found
within the Star Trek series?

38:14.823 --> 38:17.993
Truths that were shared
with Gene Roddenberry

38:18.093 --> 38:21.463
through the sessions
with the Mysterious Nine?

38:21.563 --> 38:26.003
And if so, was this in
an effort to assist humanity

38:26.101 --> 38:30.541
and guide us to a more peaceful future?

38:30.639 --> 38:34.209
Or is there another aim altogether?

38:35.977 --> 38:37.937
Perhaps one that prevents us

38:38.046 --> 38:41.106
from becoming... a threat?

38:45.106 --> 38:47.636
Before he concluded his broadcast

38:47.641 --> 38:51.711
with RT Television Network in 2013,

38:51.810 --> 38:54.910
former Canadian Defense
Minister Paul Hellyer

38:55.013 --> 38:58.113
publically urged officials
to reveal the truth

38:58.216 --> 39:02.116
about extraterrestrials
overseeing Earth.

39:02.220 --> 39:04.720
This information is
top secret in a way that

39:04.823 --> 39:06.263
the governments aren't talking about it,

39:06.358 --> 39:08.788
but if you listen to the whistleblowers

39:08.894 --> 39:10.964
and the people who have
worked in the industry,

39:11.062 --> 39:14.302
and, uh, who know what is going on,

39:14.399 --> 39:16.899
there is just a lot
of information out there,

39:17.002 --> 39:19.572
and it doesn't take very long
to get your hands on it.

39:20.272 --> 39:24.712
The future of the world depends
on us knowing what is going on.

39:24.810 --> 39:28.010
Not only in our own world, but in others

39:28.113 --> 39:31.713
that are monitoring us and
attempting to influence us,

39:31.817 --> 39:33.317
for better or for worse.

39:33.418 --> 39:37.088
And there are people here
who know a lot about that.

39:38.924 --> 39:40.364
This idea that there are other entities,

39:40.459 --> 39:42.229
whether from other dimensions,
other galaxies,

39:42.327 --> 39:44.257
other planets, who are
actually controlling,

39:44.362 --> 39:48.472
or somehow influencing what
is happening with life on Earth

39:48.567 --> 39:51.267
is fascinating, and we always
have to ask that question,

39:51.369 --> 39:52.939
what is their agenda?

39:53.038 --> 39:55.168
Is it benevolent?

39:55.273 --> 39:57.413
Are they here to protect us,

39:57.509 --> 40:01.179
as Valiant Thor and
the Nine originally said?

40:01.279 --> 40:03.409
Or is there another agenda?

40:03.515 --> 40:06.145
Is there an agenda to control us?

40:06.251 --> 40:08.851
Is there an agenda to influence

40:08.954 --> 40:10.954
the way that we live in a negative way?

40:13.024 --> 40:15.764
So you have to wonder
if there is, in fact,

40:15.861 --> 40:18.131
some kind of extraterrestrial council

40:18.230 --> 40:22.400
that's watching over Planet Earth.

40:22.501 --> 40:27.371
That they are here to
look at our advancement

40:27.472 --> 40:29.442
and to warn us of possible catastrophes

40:29.541 --> 40:32.211
that may be occurring,

40:32.310 --> 40:33.780
and hopefully,

40:33.879 --> 40:36.809
we will heed their warnings.

40:36.915 --> 40:40.715
If we're being monitored
by extraterrestrials,

40:40.819 --> 40:42.989
if they're watching human affairs,

40:43.088 --> 40:45.988
I think they would be very concerned

40:46.091 --> 40:49.891
about things that we might do
that would destroy ourselves,

40:49.995 --> 40:51.725
and destroy the planet.

40:51.830 --> 40:55.370
And perhaps part of the alien agenda

40:55.467 --> 40:57.497
is our moral development

40:57.602 --> 41:00.442
as well as our
technological development.

41:00.539 --> 41:02.339
Perhaps this is our ticket

41:02.440 --> 41:05.040
to join the galactic federation.

41:06.845 --> 41:09.145
We might never know
their ultimate purpose,

41:09.247 --> 41:13.377
but if this is an experiment,

41:13.485 --> 41:15.985
we should be very, very careful,
because quite clearly,

41:16.087 --> 41:19.257
if they don't like people
challenging them,

41:19.357 --> 41:21.987
well, we're doomed.

41:25.997 --> 41:27.357
If there are, in fact,

41:27.465 --> 41:31.725
nine extraterrestrial entities
overseeing Earth,

41:31.836 --> 41:34.096
are they here to help us,

41:34.205 --> 41:37.265
as ancient astronaut theorists suggest?

41:37.375 --> 41:39.835
Or could they have

41:39.945 --> 41:42.275
a more sinister motive?

41:44.549 --> 41:47.849
Perhaps the answer
will only be revealed

41:47.953 --> 41:50.723
when they make contact once again,

41:50.822 --> 41:52.492
and when we...

41:52.591 --> 41:54.261
are more ready to accept...

41:55.359 --> 41:56.729
the truth.
