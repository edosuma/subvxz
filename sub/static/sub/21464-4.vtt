WEBVTT

00:10.845 --> 00:13.347
<i>This is a message
from the terrorist group FC.</i>

00:14.473 --> 00:15.682
<i>To prove its authenticity,</i>

00:15.683 --> 00:21.021
<i>we give our identifying number
as 553254394.</i>

00:21.022 --> 00:23.441
<i>To</i> The New York Times,
<i>we are offering a bargain.</i>

00:23.941 --> 00:26.109
<i>If you publish our manifesto,</i>

00:26.110 --> 00:29.863
<i>we will permanently desist
from all terrorist activities.</i>

00:29.864 --> 00:32.115
The killer known as the Unabomber

00:32.116 --> 00:34.743
says he will stop
mailing package bombs

00:34.744 --> 00:37.496
if the newspapers will publish
his political theories.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.540
<i>As I'm sure you know,
bombs may attract attention,</i>

00:40.541 --> 00:42.876
<i>but ideas start revolutions.</i>

00:42.877 --> 00:46.129
<i>That is our sole aim,
and if we break our word,</i>

00:46.130 --> 00:49.717
<i>people will lose respect for us
and be less likely to accept our ideas.</i>

00:49.884 --> 00:53.637
The question now is, can the word
of a serial killer be trusted?

00:53.888 --> 00:56.015
Well, what have we learned
from the LAX incident?

00:56.182 --> 00:57.849
His reputation is the most
important thing to him,

00:57.850 --> 00:59.684
so if he says he'll stop bombing,
he'll stop bombing.

00:59.685 --> 01:02.729
The United States government
does not negotiate with terrorists.

01:02.730 --> 01:03.814
This is how we catch him.

01:04.523 --> 01:06.733
If we publish, someone
will recognize his idiolect,

01:06.734 --> 01:08.402
his ideology, or both.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.614
You haven't got a fingerprint
in 17 years.

01:11.822 --> 01:14.074
He just gave us a linguistic
fingerprint on a silver platter.

01:14.075 --> 01:17.078
The United States government
does not negotiate with terrorists.

01:17.453 --> 01:18.704
<i>The FBI is a joke.</i>

01:19.413 --> 01:22.958
<i>They've tried to portray these bombings
as the work of an isolated nut.</i>

01:23.334 --> 01:26.169
The so-called Unabomber,
blamed for 16 attacks in 17 years,

01:26.170 --> 01:27.754
has now spoken out.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.090
In several letters,
one to <i>The New York Times,</i>

01:30.091 --> 01:32.592
the bomber denounced
the industrial society.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.054
We publish the manifesto
and use his plan against him.

01:35.387 --> 01:37.013
We did publish the Zodiac Killer.

01:37.014 --> 01:39.140
Yeah, and he kept on killing
and nobody caught him,

01:39.141 --> 01:42.060
which is why,
everybody together now,

01:42.061 --> 01:45.021
the United States government
does not negotiate with terrorists.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.273
<i>Our goal is less to punish the people</i>

01:47.274 --> 01:49.400
<i>pushing all this
growth-and-progress garbage</i>

01:49.401 --> 01:51.904
<i>than it is to propagate ideas.</i>

01:53.030 --> 01:54.948
This outlines my whole case
for publication.

01:54.949 --> 01:57.575
You can take it to Janet Reno,
you can take it to FBI Director Freeh.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.702
I'm supposed to walk into
Janet Reno's office

01:59.703 --> 02:03.248
and ask her to publicly give in
to the demands of a terrorist

02:03.249 --> 02:05.959
because someone might
recognize his spelling?

02:05.960 --> 02:09.003
<i>If our manifesto is not published
by</i> The New York Times

02:09.004 --> 02:11.840
<i>or some other nationally
distributed periodical,</i>

02:11.841 --> 02:13.717
<i>another bomb is ready
to be delivered.</i>

02:14.218 --> 02:15.385
<i>This is Bob Guccione,</i>

02:15.386 --> 02:17.179
<i>the Editor-in-Chief
of</i> Penthouse <i>magazine.</i>

02:18.139 --> 02:19.973
<i>I have been following
your correspondence</i>

02:19.974 --> 02:21.183
<i>with</i> The New York Times,

02:21.976 --> 02:24.477
<i>and I believe your offer
to desist from the bombing is genuine,</i>

02:24.478 --> 02:27.564
<i>so I am offering to immediately
publish your article,</i>

02:27.565 --> 02:29.732
<i>unedited, and in full,</i>

02:29.733 --> 02:31.359
<i>in</i> Penthouse <i>magazine.</i>

02:31.360 --> 02:34.154
<i>Our demographic is virtually
the same as</i> The New York Times.

02:34.155 --> 02:38.075
<i>I might add we're the biggest-selling
magazine in the Pentagon.</i>

02:38.534 --> 02:41.661
<i>Mr. Guccione, we are very pleased,
and we thank you.</i>

02:41.662 --> 02:44.164
<i>While we don't have anything
against sex magazines,</i>

02:44.165 --> 02:46.207
<i>it will obviously
be to our advantage</i>

02:46.208 --> 02:50.253
<i>to be published in
a "respectable" periodical.</i>

02:50.254 --> 02:52.380
The New York Times
<i>is to have the first claim</i>

02:52.381 --> 02:54.591
<i>on the right to publish,
then</i> The Washington Post,

02:54.592 --> 02:56.510
<i>and after that,</i> Penthouse.

02:57.052 --> 02:59.263
<i>However,
if only</i> Penthouse <i>publishes,</i>

03:00.181 --> 03:02.975
<i>we reserve the right
to plant one more deadly bomb.</i>

03:09.690 --> 03:12.525
Sir, please consider the case
for publication.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.028
He sends us a manifesto,
and that was his first mistake,

03:15.029 --> 03:16.487
and we should exploit it
for all it's worth.

03:16.488 --> 03:19.992
His first mistake actually was
Nathan R.,

03:21.160 --> 03:23.036
and as of 7 A.M. this morning,

03:23.037 --> 03:24.705
we have Nathan R.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.582
Nathan R.,
AKA Nathan Robinson,

03:27.583 --> 03:29.083
out of San Jose.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.920
He's an old acquaintance of,
guess who,

03:31.837 --> 03:34.715
Leo Frederick Burt,
our current top suspect.

03:35.007 --> 03:37.759
Our S.O.G. teams are hunting
down Robinson right now.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.803
He's been charged with terroristic
threatening of a peace officer,

03:40.804 --> 03:43.348
possession of narcotics,
mail fraud.

03:43.349 --> 03:45.141
We put a tail on him,
there's a pretty good chance

03:45.142 --> 03:46.809
he's going to lead us to Leo Burt.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.978
The linguistic evidence
eliminated Leo Burt.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.563
Okay, Fitz.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.981
You've said your piece,

03:51.982 --> 03:54.108
but we don't negotiate with terrorists.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.486
Genelli, get to New York.
Brief <i>The Times.</i>

03:56.487 --> 04:00.323
I'll be in Washington with
Director Freeh and Janet Reno.

04:00.324 --> 04:01.325
That's it, folks.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.675
<i>Mia, look at that.
I mean, it really sparkles, right?</i>

05:00.676 --> 05:04.012
<i>And it is setting --</i>
- Hey.

05:04.013 --> 05:05.097
Wow.

05:07.308 --> 05:08.350
Wow.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.478
You know, this job,
they're always saying,

05:12.479 --> 05:15.232
"If you guys have all the answers,
why haven't we caught him by now?"

05:15.482 --> 05:16.482
It's, like, wake up.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.651
I'm giving them so much,
and they just don't even listen.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.112
Well, it's not all bad.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.322
- No?
- No.

05:22.323 --> 05:25.158
- Because?
- Because...

05:25.159 --> 05:32.082
it's after 5:00 and I'm finally here
and there are no kids anywhere.

05:33.751 --> 05:34.877
Mmm.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.427
Well, he's just a kid.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.762
It's easy to get passionate
about something

05:45.763 --> 05:46.929
and not realize you're wrong.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.349
He's not really a kid,

05:48.724 --> 05:50.893
and he's not wrong, exactly.
It's...

05:51.143 --> 05:54.145
He just has no practical
experience for what this means.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.397
He's got no big picture.

05:56.190 --> 05:58.941
So, what do you think?
Is it worth it?

06:00.152 --> 06:01.944
This is it, Beth.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.364
This case <i>is</i> the one.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.156
This is how I'm going
to be remembered,

06:05.157 --> 06:06.199
it's going to be my legacy.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.078
There's so much
you'll be remembered for.

06:09.328 --> 06:12.289
Eh, I could lock up
a million serial killers.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.958
But I'll always be the guy
that led Unabom.

06:15.751 --> 06:18.295
Yeah, that's me.
That's me forever.

06:18.504 --> 06:20.089
The Scarlet U, huh?

06:20.798 --> 06:22.090
Sweetie.

06:22.091 --> 06:24.093
It's a buzzer shot,
and I only get one.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.429
Sometimes I just wish I could...

06:28.680 --> 06:30.682
pass the damn ball to the next guy.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.143
There's no glory
but no catastrophe.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.938
Just the path of least resistance.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.274
Terrible, huh?

06:40.734 --> 06:41.777
It's weak.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.822
But, boy...

06:45.614 --> 06:47.032
I think about it.

06:55.624 --> 06:57.667
Director Freeh,
S.A.C. Ackerman,

06:57.668 --> 06:59.837
Attorney General Reno
will be with you shortly.

07:00.546 --> 07:01.463
Thank you.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.553
Don, listen.
This is a cakewalk.

07:08.554 --> 07:10.680
You're just telling her
what she wants to hear.

07:10.681 --> 07:14.559
- Don't publish a terrorist.
- Leo Burt's a good lead.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.602
And you've got a ton more
where that came from.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.687
Mm-hmm.

07:17.688 --> 07:19.523
All of the Tier 1 guys are solid.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.109
Yeah.

07:22.693 --> 07:25.195
Listen, you inherited a garbage case.

07:26.530 --> 07:27.865
No one expects a miracle.

07:28.407 --> 07:31.535
Reno just wants to know that we're
doing our jobs, which we are,

07:32.161 --> 07:34.913
and wants to see a nice, thick folder,
which is what you have.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.636
Genelli, it's Ackerman.
What's up?

07:50.137 --> 07:53.598
I'm at <i>The New York Times,</i>
and I have some bad news.

07:53.599 --> 07:55.809
It's okay, we'll --
we'll be fine,

07:56.268 --> 07:59.313
but I got here early
for my meeting with Sulzberger.

08:00.105 --> 08:04.193
There was this mail-room guy.
I followed him back to his desk.

08:04.359 --> 08:08.779
You know the "call Nathan R." note
that was indented writing on the envelope

08:08.780 --> 08:10.240
the Unabomber sent <i>The Times?</i>

08:10.574 --> 08:15.161
Well, this mail-room guy handles
every letter that comes to <i>The Times,</i>

08:15.162 --> 08:16.872
and he's really into Post-its.

08:17.789 --> 08:21.375
That Unabom letter came
to <i>The New York Times</i> mail room

08:21.376 --> 08:23.337
before it got to us.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.923
That indented writing was made
by Reggie Halender,

08:26.924 --> 08:29.134
mail intern here at <i>The Times.</i>

08:29.426 --> 08:32.137
The Unabomber didn't write
the Nathan R. note.

08:32.888 --> 08:34.556
There is no Nathan R.

08:37.684 --> 08:40.394
You're telling me that we've
been chasing a dead lead

08:40.395 --> 08:42.523
for the last two years?

08:43.148 --> 08:43.982
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:44.566 --> 08:47.319
- How many Nathan Rs have we been--
<i>- I know. Sorry.</i>

08:47.653 --> 08:49.488
Goddamn it.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.878
This doesn't change anything.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.964
She wants broad strokes.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.465
Just de-emphasize Nathan R

09:09.466 --> 09:11.468
and focus on Burt
and the other top-tier leads.

09:18.392 --> 09:21.978
This whole miniature
war-gaming thing

09:21.979 --> 09:24.105
has officially taken over
the dining room table,

09:24.106 --> 09:27.233
and Sean's really territorial about it,

09:27.234 --> 09:31.363
and I can't even
suggest that he move it

09:31.530 --> 09:33.322
without him freaking out.

09:33.323 --> 09:34.574
You think I should
learn the game?

09:34.575 --> 09:35.617
I think I should learn the game.

09:36.201 --> 09:38.829
I think you've got quite enough
games in your life already.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.378
It's not how I want it to be.
It really isn't.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.840
Look, when I said that,
I just meant...

09:51.800 --> 09:53.927
I know.
I know, but you're right.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.929
You're right, because, you know,

09:56.930 --> 09:59.600
no one at the UTF even really
listens to a word I say, so...

10:00.350 --> 10:01.852
I might as well
be playing a game.

10:02.603 --> 10:06.272
My work has hit a dead end,
so I'm going to ask Genelli,

10:06.273 --> 10:09.650
because I think it's time
for me to come home.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.111
Oh, love, I didn't...

10:12.613 --> 10:14.323
That's not why I came here.

10:15.324 --> 10:18.492
I mean, I would be so,

10:18.493 --> 10:20.996
so happy to be a family again, but...

10:22.372 --> 10:24.458
I just want to feel like
I'm making a difference.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.971
- Hey, it's Fitz.
<i>- You've got 30 minutes</i>

10:38.972 --> 10:41.932
<i>to come up with something better
than forensic linguistics.</i>

10:41.933 --> 10:44.561
Nathan R. is a dead end,

10:44.728 --> 10:47.856
but language is not enough here.

10:48.023 --> 10:50.858
<i>You bring me something
concrete and operational</i>

10:50.859 --> 10:53.110
<i>that I can give to Reno
to back up your case,</i>

10:53.111 --> 10:56.447
well, then I might be willing
to float publication with the A.G.

10:56.448 --> 10:57.282
If I do...

10:57.574 --> 10:58.867
if...

10:59.868 --> 11:01.619
then both our asses are on the line.

11:01.620 --> 11:02.828
Do you understand me?

11:02.829 --> 11:04.373
<i>All right, now,
Cole is already on it.</i>

11:04.623 --> 11:05.916
<i>You two brainstorm.</i>

11:06.124 --> 11:07.668
You be brilliant, quickly.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.003
You got 29 minutes.
Go.

11:17.260 --> 11:19.345
Concrete and operational.
Let's go.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.181
Okay, we know he likes code,
so if we embed a code in a publication,

11:22.182 --> 11:23.557
we can lure him into a conversation--

11:23.558 --> 11:26.895
I said concrete and operational,
not esoteric intellectual crap.

11:27.270 --> 11:30.356
Now, I know he's got 10 PhDs
and a 500 I.Q.,

11:30.357 --> 11:32.525
but he's still a serial killer, right?

11:32.526 --> 11:34.069
And what do serial killers want?

11:34.820 --> 11:36.987
Control, power, respect.

11:36.988 --> 11:37.864
Trophies.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.327
Serial killers collect fingers, hairs.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.662
Serial rapists collect underwear.

11:44.663 --> 11:47.123
Right, so what's his trophy?
What does he want?

11:47.124 --> 11:48.916
He wants us to publish
the manifesto in a newspaper.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.001
Newspapers are his trophy.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.877
So we publish it, he goes,
gets it, buys a copy.

11:51.878 --> 11:52.878
What's that going to get us?

11:52.879 --> 11:54.505
I mean, he can buy
<i>The New York Times</i>

11:54.506 --> 11:56.800
at any newsstand in the country
any time he wants.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.009
It's not actionable.

11:58.844 --> 12:02.430
<i>- The Post. Washington Post.</i>
- What about it?

12:02.431 --> 12:04.766
Every time I finish <i>The Times</i>
crossword, I go get <i>The Post.</i>

12:05.434 --> 12:07.601
It's a pain in the ass
because you can only buy it

12:07.602 --> 12:09.146
at one newsstand in the city.

12:14.317 --> 12:16.862
So if we publish in <i>The Post...</i>

12:17.154 --> 12:18.739
Then we know
he's in the Bay Area.

12:18.989 --> 12:20.949
He'll want to see it.
He'll need to touch it.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.493
He'll want to see people buying it.

12:24.619 --> 12:25.787
He'll want to see people reading it.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.540
He's going to want to see
his ideas make a difference.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.794
Dude, that's 150 S.O.G., minimum.

12:33.211 --> 12:34.421
Well, it's not my problem.

12:35.505 --> 12:36.506
Fitz has got to sell it.

12:40.844 --> 12:42.261
<i>- Cole.</i>
- What do you got?

12:42.262 --> 12:44.181
Got Fitz and Tabby in here.
Hang on.

12:45.515 --> 12:48.184
- Go ahead, Fitz.
- We know he's Bay Area,

12:48.185 --> 12:51.061
and we think if we publish,
he would buy the paper as a trophy.

12:51.062 --> 12:53.773
<i>The Washington Post</i> is sold at
only one newsstand in the Bay Area,

12:53.774 --> 12:55.357
<i>so if we publish exclusively
in</i> The Post,

12:55.358 --> 12:57.276
<i>he'll have to come there and buy it,
so on publication day,</i>

12:57.277 --> 13:00.988
I'm proposing we follow
and identify every single person

13:00.989 --> 13:02.908
who buys a <i>Washington Post</i>
in San Francisco.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.291
<i>This is a joke?</i>

13:12.501 --> 13:14.753
Do you realize the scale?

13:16.046 --> 13:20.884
We would have to drain the entire
country of surveillance teams.

13:21.259 --> 13:22.219
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

13:23.178 --> 13:26.139
That's insane.
For chri-- Jesus.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.476
Hello.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.353
Madam Attorney General,
thank you for having us.

13:32.354 --> 13:36.525
Director Freeh, S.A.C. Ackerman.
Thank you both for waiting.

13:44.950 --> 13:46.659
I guess that's a no.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.078
That was fun.

13:48.787 --> 13:51.748
All right.
Back to work.

13:54.459 --> 13:57.294
Thank you for seeing us
on such short notice.

13:57.295 --> 14:00.965
Well, domestic terror has a way
of clearing the decks, doesn't it?

14:00.966 --> 14:02.801
Especially when
the media is involved.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.178
Can I get you a coffee
or some water?

14:06.179 --> 14:09.223
"Wudder."

14:09.224 --> 14:10.475
Are you from Philly?

14:10.809 --> 14:12.602
Originally, yeah.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.729
No, thank you.
We're fine.

14:21.987 --> 14:24.905
So the Unabomber's publishing
deadline is approaching.

14:24.906 --> 14:26.991
<i>The Times</i> and <i>The Post</i>
are on my call sheet.

14:26.992 --> 14:28.577
What am I going to tell them?

14:29.494 --> 14:30.787
Ackerman?

14:34.457 --> 14:36.418
The FBI recommendation...

14:39.337 --> 14:41.006
Don?

14:43.091 --> 14:46.595
The FBI recommendation
is that we publish the manifesto,

14:47.637 --> 14:49.055
in full.

14:51.516 --> 14:54.393
We publish exclusively
in <i>The Washington Post</i>

14:54.394 --> 14:56.353
as part of a two-pronged approach.

14:56.354 --> 14:59.107
First prong--
forensic linguistics.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.903
If we make the manifesto
widely accessible,

15:03.612 --> 15:05.321
I believe that there is
an excellent chance

15:05.322 --> 15:08.657
that a friend or a colleague
of the Unabomber

15:08.658 --> 15:11.368
will recognize his unique language
and ideology

15:11.369 --> 15:13.121
and will turn him in.

15:14.497 --> 15:15.457
Second...

15:16.499 --> 15:17.750
There's a high likelihood

15:17.751 --> 15:20.045
that the Unabomber lives
in the Bay Area.

15:20.670 --> 15:26.760
Now, <i>The Washington Post</i> is sold
at only one location in San Francisco.

15:27.177 --> 15:31.931
This unique advantage will allow us
to stage a large surveillance operation

15:31.932 --> 15:34.850
to follow, to question, to identify

15:34.851 --> 15:37.394
every individual
who buys a copy of <i>The Post</i>

15:37.395 --> 15:39.521
on the day of publication.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.942
While this operation...

15:44.778 --> 15:49.032
While the size and scale
of this operation is unprecedented,

15:51.034 --> 15:52.868
we believe it to be
a singular opportunity

15:52.869 --> 15:55.245
to lure the Unabomber
into the light.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.915
That's an unusual strategy.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.585
You're betting big
that he's in the Bay Area.

16:02.712 --> 16:06.799
Well, we've traced
every Unabom letter,

16:06.800 --> 16:10.470
package, and bomb to the exact
mailbox he dropped it in.

16:11.304 --> 16:15.099
Every single one of them is within
an eight-mile radius of San Francisco.

16:15.100 --> 16:18.019
If he's coming to town
to mail his bombs,

16:18.812 --> 16:21.147
he'll come to town
to buy his manifesto.

16:21.856 --> 16:23.399
And what's the precedent here?

16:23.400 --> 16:25.776
Where do we stand
once all this is done?

16:25.777 --> 16:27.820
I believe that we can say
with conviction

16:27.821 --> 16:30.990
that publication is less to assuage
the demands of the attacker

16:30.991 --> 16:33.618
than to use his plan against him

16:33.868 --> 16:36.454
so that it establishes
a precedent of vigilance

16:37.163 --> 16:40.000
rather than weakness on the part
of law enforcement.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.334
If you catch him.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.670
Yes, ma'am. If we catch him.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.422
Big if.

16:46.423 --> 16:49.592
Director Freeh,
is FBI HQ on board with this?

16:51.845 --> 16:57.057
Don has taken it upon himself
to propose implementing

16:57.058 --> 17:00.353
one of the largest surveillance
operations in FBI history.

17:01.896 --> 17:04.690
We're happy to let Don
take the lead

17:04.691 --> 17:06.901
and be the face
of this operation.

17:07.402 --> 17:09.154
Don, you're nearing retirement,
aren't you?

17:09.612 --> 17:12.490
You're aware of the implications
of this coming undone.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.493
You still want to do it?

17:18.121 --> 17:19.997
What I don't want to do
is see any more pictures

17:19.998 --> 17:21.332
of ripped-up bodies,

17:21.916 --> 17:23.584
and I don't want
to pawn this case off

17:23.585 --> 17:25.628
on the next guy coming after me.

17:27.088 --> 17:28.757
This is our best move.

17:29.299 --> 17:30.300
It's risky.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.385
We got others.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.305
But this one's the best.

17:36.431 --> 17:37.806
Well, I just want to make certain

17:37.807 --> 17:40.143
that you're aware
of the consequences here.

17:41.269 --> 17:44.897
What happened at Waco,
my decisions there,

17:44.898 --> 17:48.318
will haunt me for the rest
of my natural life,

17:48.610 --> 17:51.028
and I can say from experience
that everything's different

17:51.029 --> 17:52.655
when the camera
is pointed at you.

17:54.157 --> 17:55.200
Yeah.

17:57.202 --> 18:00.079
But I'd rather respect
the man I see in the mirror

18:00.080 --> 18:01.915
than the man I see on TV.

18:03.833 --> 18:07.002
Okay.
Let's do it.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.630
You have the full support
of the D.O.J.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.427
Madam Attorney General.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.638
- Director.
- Thank you.

18:17.639 --> 18:22.102
Don, I admire
your moral courage in this.

18:22.685 --> 18:25.395
It isn't always rewarded,

18:25.396 --> 18:28.607
and in your case,
I certainly hope it is.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.360
Thank you,
Madam Attorney General.

18:36.241 --> 18:37.449
I'm following you.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.244
- Mrs. Fitzgerald?
- Hi.

18:39.744 --> 18:41.912
I'm Tabby Miller.
Great to finally meet you.

18:41.913 --> 18:42.996
It's nice to meet you.

18:42.997 --> 18:44.374
Welcome to the biggest
shit show on Earth.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.883
They're asking for...

18:54.884 --> 18:56.302
Publication,
stuff that we're...

19:00.181 --> 19:03.183
- Hi.
- I needed to see this.

19:03.184 --> 19:04.768
- Hey. You made it.
- Is this okay?

19:04.769 --> 19:06.979
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's just insane here today.

19:06.980 --> 19:07.981
This is Natalie Rogers.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.023
- Hi.
- Hi!

19:10.024 --> 19:11.525
- So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

19:11.526 --> 19:13.110
I work with your husband.

19:13.111 --> 19:14.445
I've been hearing
so much about you.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.447
Have you?

19:26.708 --> 19:28.168
Gentlemen,
good where you are.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.713
S.A.C. Ackerman?

19:48.813 --> 19:51.857
<i>Good afternoon.
My name is Don Ackerman,</i>

19:51.858 --> 19:55.402
<i>special agent in charge,
FBI, San Francisco,</i>

19:55.403 --> 19:58.406
<i>and one of the leaders
of the UNABOM Task Force.</i>

20:00.033 --> 20:01.825
<i>The Attorney General,
Janet Reno,</i>

20:01.826 --> 20:03.994
<i>and FBI Director Louis J. Freeh</i>

20:03.995 --> 20:06.079
<i>today announced
that they recommend</i>

20:06.080 --> 20:09.291
<i>the publication
of the Unabomber's manifesto.</i>

20:09.292 --> 20:13.712
<i>Concern for public safety
ultimately led to this decision.</i>

20:13.713 --> 20:16.215
<i>The UNABOM Task Force
continues to encourage</i>

20:16.216 --> 20:20.010
<i>the cooperation of the American
public by calling our hotline.</i>

20:20.011 --> 20:24.264
<i>The FBI can now be found
at our brand-new home page</i>

20:24.265 --> 20:30.104
<i>on the World Wide Web at
www.fbi.gov,</i>

20:31.105 --> 20:34.441
<i>and in the coming days,
we will upload the manifesto</i>

20:34.442 --> 20:37.778
<i>for anyone to access.</i>

20:37.779 --> 20:40.948
<i>We ask that the public
pay particular attention</i>

20:40.949 --> 20:43.533
<i>to the philosophies in the manifesto</i>

20:43.534 --> 20:46.203
<i>and to try to recall
if they know any individuals</i>

20:46.204 --> 20:48.247
<i>who have had
similar philosophies</i>

20:48.248 --> 20:50.123
<i>or who have written
in similar linguistic styles...</i>

20:50.124 --> 20:52.210
Philosophies.
We told him to say that.

20:53.878 --> 20:56.922
<i>We believe that with the help
of the American public,</i>

20:56.923 --> 20:59.050
<i>the Unabomber will have
no place to hide.</i>

21:00.802 --> 21:03.220
<i>And now I will take your questions.</i>

21:03.221 --> 21:05.472
So good.

21:07.475 --> 21:09.102
Whoo!

21:11.020 --> 21:12.604
Hey, I forgot to tell you.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.649
I got a call this morning
from school,

21:15.650 --> 21:19.611
and they've got head lice
going around like crazy.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.823
They were asking if
I could come in.

21:22.824 --> 21:25.242
Begging, actually.

21:25.243 --> 21:27.160
I told them no
because I kind of feel

21:27.161 --> 21:29.122
like you need me here, right?

21:30.790 --> 21:33.918
It's fine if you need to go.
Don't worry about me.

21:34.210 --> 21:35.752
If you want to go back,
it's okay.

21:35.753 --> 21:38.380
Okay, but I don't want to go.

21:38.381 --> 21:40.508
Okay, then stay, have some fun,
but I'm not gonna be around.

21:41.342 --> 21:42.760
I'm gonna stay.

21:45.221 --> 21:48.641
What--what's the matter?
What do you want me to say?

21:54.355 --> 21:55.356
It's fine.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.775
Go. Go, go.

22:05.616 --> 22:07.909
<i>Let us describe
what has happened plainly.</i>

22:07.910 --> 22:10.579
It is blackmail, pure and simple.

22:10.580 --> 22:13.249
<i>Since when do we trust a serial killer?</i>

22:14.000 --> 22:15.876
<i>The bomber
calls his manifesto</i>

22:15.877 --> 22:18.337
<i>"Industrial Society and its Future."</i>

22:18.338 --> 22:20.005
<i>Eight solid-gray pages,</i>

22:20.006 --> 22:22.008
<i>perhaps as likely to be discarded</i>

22:22.425 --> 22:26.094
<i>as trudged through to reach
the Unabomber's central thesis</i>

22:26.095 --> 22:29.556
<i>that technology has gotten
the human race into a fix</i>

22:29.557 --> 22:32.185
<i>from which there is not likely
to be any easy escape.</i>

22:34.145 --> 22:36.688
<i>Now that his so-called
manifesto has been published</i>

22:36.689 --> 22:39.316
<i>in</i> The Washington Post,
<i>say investigators,</i>

22:39.317 --> 22:41.318
<i>they're hoping for more than
just a cease-fire</i>

22:41.319 --> 22:42.487
<i>in the bombings and threats.</i>

22:42.695 --> 22:45.113
<i>Maybe somewhere in this
densely-worded text,</i>

22:45.114 --> 22:47.366
<i>there will be some concrete clues
to his identity,</i>

22:47.367 --> 22:50.745
<i>which may finally
net investigators an arrest.</i>

23:17.522 --> 23:19.065
<i>Be advised, this is PO1.</i>

23:19.315 --> 23:23.151
<i>Unsub is a black male,

23:23.152 --> 23:25.822
<i>PO1, this is PO5.

<i>This is SF1.

<i>SF3, this is SF1.
Unsub is a white female, gray suit.</i>

23:40.378 --> 23:43.088
<i>She's exiting onto Stockton Street.</i>

23:43.089 --> 23:45.842
<i>SF1, this is SF3.
I have the eye.</i>

23:47.552 --> 23:49.177
<i>PO4, this is PO1.</i>

23:49.178 --> 23:52.097
<i>Unsub is a white male,

23:52.098 --> 23:55.684

White male in his 40s.

24:00.523 --> 24:02.149
<i>Listen,

24:02.150 --> 24:05.360
<i>please will you circle

24:13.619 --> 24:16.079
Woman, on radio:
<i>...Agent is moving into position now.</i>

24:16.080 --> 24:16.998
Copy.

24:27.467 --> 24:30.928
Half of San Francisco's

24:33.598 --> 24:35.265
<i>LA 12, this is LA 1.</i>

Yeah, copy that.

Burkhardt, what's your status?

24:59.332 --> 25:02.335
<i>Subject cooperative.

25:21.729 --> 25:25.273
Sacramento 3,
the unsub 5 is Rafael Fetters,

25:25.274 --> 25:27.442
Pacific Heights, should be all clear.

25:27.443 --> 25:29.529
Follow him to his destination,
proceed with the interview.

25:31.781 --> 25:33.574
Anything particular that
you bought <i>The Post</i> for today?

25:43.376 --> 25:44.584
<i>PO3, this is PO1.</i>

25:44.585 --> 25:47.088
<i>Unsub is white male, 50s,
brown leather jacket.</i>

25:47.547 --> 25:48.464
Yeah!

25:48.965 --> 25:52.008
CA9, his name is Willie Wright.

25:52.009 --> 25:53.511
<i>No NCIC hits, subject clear.</i>

26:00.017 --> 26:01.977
<i>We're good to clear.
Return to staging area.</i>

26:01.978 --> 26:03.396
Copy that.

26:05.690 --> 26:07.148
Running out of time.

26:07.149 --> 26:10.151
Newsstand's closing soon.
Should have been here by now.

26:10.152 --> 26:11.987
<i>No NCIC hits, subject cleared.</i>

26:11.988 --> 26:13.488
<i>- Cleared.
- Subject is cleared.</i>

26:13.489 --> 26:15.950
<i>Nothing to do here.
- Subjects are cleared, repeat, cleared.</i>

26:17.451 --> 26:21.581
<i>Unsub 109, white male, 50s,
green hooded jacket, sunglasses.</i>

26:22.915 --> 26:25.334
<i>This is the last guy.
We've cleared everyone else.</i>

26:27.003 --> 26:28.379
That's the profile.

26:40.516 --> 26:41.892
He's got it.

26:55.990 --> 26:58.909
SF67, I want you on unsub 109.

27:00.244 --> 27:02.538
Eyes on unsub 109, copy that.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.001
Later.

27:13.633 --> 27:14.842
Gonna lose him.

27:24.477 --> 27:26.270
<i>Going into BART.
Gonna lose you.</i>

27:28.230 --> 27:29.357
Copy that.

28:06.894 --> 28:08.270
<i>Now arriving, Powell Street.</i>

28:08.729 --> 28:10.064
<i>Stand clear.</i>

28:48.644 --> 28:49.895
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

28:50.104 --> 28:52.189
<i>Please stand clear of the doors.</i>

29:08.789 --> 29:11.333
<i>Now arriving,
Rockridge Station.</i>

29:24.764 --> 29:26.140
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

29:26.515 --> 29:28.559
<i>Please stand clear of the doors.</i>

29:48.370 --> 29:49.997
She's been out of touch too long.

29:58.380 --> 29:59.715
<i>Montgomery Station.</i>

30:02.426 --> 30:03.511
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

30:03.928 --> 30:05.262
<i>Please stand clear of the doors.</i>

30:08.140 --> 30:09.517
FBI! Stop!

30:17.817 --> 30:19.652
FBI! Stop! Get down!

30:37.670 --> 30:39.838
FBI.
Out of the way.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.537
Unh!

31:15.249 --> 31:16.834
FBI! Freeze!

31:26.844 --> 31:28.387
FBI! Freeze!

31:33.893 --> 31:35.019
Get on the ground!

31:35.394 --> 31:37.521
Get on the ground now!

31:42.234 --> 31:43.736
Come in, SF67.

31:49.283 --> 31:50.159
Tabby, you there?

31:55.164 --> 31:56.873
- You bitch.
- Don't move.

31:56.874 --> 31:59.043
Are you him?
Are you carrying a device?

31:59.335 --> 32:00.502
Go to hell.

32:02.046 --> 32:03.963
- Is there a bomb in that bag?
- Augh!

32:03.964 --> 32:05.215
What the hell
are you talking about?

32:08.886 --> 32:10.596
Oh, shit.

32:21.941 --> 32:22.857
Yeah.

32:22.858 --> 32:24.442
He's just some damn druggie.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.652
He's got a bunch of open warrants.

32:25.653 --> 32:27.278
That's why he was acting weird.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.405
Sex with a minor,
possession, distribution--

32:29.406 --> 32:31.115
<i>you name it, he's wanted for it.</i>

32:31.116 --> 32:32.868
<i>Except Unabom.</i>

32:33.285 --> 32:34.328
Right.

33:05.442 --> 33:07.695
So a total failure, then.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.656
Oh, it was a brave call.

33:11.991 --> 33:13.325
That's too bad.

33:14.201 --> 33:15.119
Thank you.

34:04.209 --> 34:05.668
<i>We're always negotiating
with terrorists.</i>

34:05.669 --> 34:07.670
<i>In fact, our government
is negotiating with terrorists</i>

34:07.671 --> 34:08.838
<i>out of one corner of its mouth</i>

34:08.839 --> 34:10.339
<i>while, out of the other side
of its mouth,</i>

34:10.340 --> 34:12.633
<i>it tells the American public,
"No, we don't deal with terrorism.</i>

34:12.634 --> 34:13.926
<i>"We couldn't possibly</i>

34:13.927 --> 34:16.471
<i>deal with terrorists,"
whereas that's exactly what they do,</i>

34:16.472 --> 34:18.057
<i>so it's nothing new.</i>

34:18.348 --> 34:20.558
<i>It's just that we're seeing publicly
for the first time</i>

34:20.559 --> 34:22.185
<i>what hypocrites the FBI</i>

34:22.186 --> 34:23.770
<i>truly are, and, frankly...</i>

34:23.771 --> 34:25.104
- Fitz.
<i>- they look like fools</i>

34:25.105 --> 34:26.564
<i>in front of the entire nation.</i>

34:26.565 --> 34:30.069
<i>The Unabomber had called them fools,
and we can all see that he was correct.</i>

34:30.569 --> 34:33.822
<i>If I were an FBI agent right now,
I would be ashamed.</i>

34:34.114 --> 34:37.158
<i>Ashamed to show my face,
ashamed of my institution.</i>

34:37.159 --> 34:38.410
<i>Excuse me.</i>

34:38.744 --> 34:41.913
<i>You're a pornographer saying
the FBI should be ashamed?</i>

34:41.914 --> 34:43.289
<i>That's right.
At</i> Penthouse <i>magazine,</i>

34:43.290 --> 34:44.999
<i>we don't say one thing
and do another.</i>

34:45.000 --> 34:47.335
<i>We don't say, "Oh, we're so
high and mighty and pure."</i>

34:47.336 --> 34:49.420
<i>We never stoop to
bargaining with a terrorist</i>

34:49.421 --> 34:51.047
<i>then basically bend over,</i>

34:51.048 --> 34:52.840
<i>spread our cheeks for him
in front of the whole world,</i>

34:52.841 --> 34:54.884
<i>which is what the FBI just did,</i>

34:54.885 --> 34:58.012
<i>and I think the country has to think
long and hard about that.</i>

34:58.013 --> 34:59.723
<i>Who can we really trust?</i>

35:13.320 --> 35:15.989
I know you think this is a setback.
It's really a huge win.

35:17.741 --> 35:19.534
The manifesto's out there.

35:19.535 --> 35:22.161
People will read it to someone
who'll recognize his idiolect--

35:22.162 --> 35:24.498
Yeah, everyone's
recognizing the "idiolect."

35:24.957 --> 35:27.668
You've taken
the investigation backwards.

35:28.418 --> 35:31.796
We now have a tip line that's
being pounded by every ex-wife,

35:31.797 --> 35:33.381
every pissed-off sister-in-law,

35:33.382 --> 35:35.300
every brother with a grudge
in the country.

35:36.260 --> 35:37.511
It's all garbage.

35:38.262 --> 35:41.347
Some birthday cards,
a grocery list.

35:41.348 --> 35:44.058
Got a book report from
"My Side of the Mountain."

35:44.059 --> 35:46.436
Here's a good one.
You recognize the spelling on that?

35:47.020 --> 35:49.689
The fax machine is
spitting this stuff out faster

35:49.690 --> 35:52.525
than we can reload the paper,
let alone the mail.

35:52.526 --> 35:54.694
The country's trash can's
being dumped in our lap here,

35:54.695 --> 35:56.905
and it's all worthless.
All of it.

35:59.032 --> 36:02.702
Your TDY with
the UNABOM Task Force is terminated,

36:02.703 --> 36:04.370
and if we need
your expertise again,

36:04.371 --> 36:06.248
we'll make sure to contact you.

36:10.210 --> 36:12.546
There's still a lot of work
I could do with document analysis.

36:17.551 --> 36:19.136
You want to know the truth, Fitz?

36:20.137 --> 36:21.972
I feel I can tell you this, frankly.

36:23.557 --> 36:26.310
You're going to have
a long career with the FBI,

36:26.602 --> 36:30.396
but it's not because
you're talented or special.

36:30.397 --> 36:32.148
See, you've been telling
yourself your whole life

36:32.149 --> 36:35.943
that all of your problems
are because you're an artist,

36:35.944 --> 36:38.947
because you're a special snowflake.

36:39.615 --> 36:40.866
But you're not.

36:41.325 --> 36:43.118
You're just another asshole.

36:44.036 --> 36:45.454
And you're going home now

36:46.413 --> 36:49.583
so we can bring in some other
asshole to replace you.

36:49.791 --> 36:51.250
And guess what?

36:51.251 --> 36:54.004
No one's gonna even know
the difference.

36:55.589 --> 36:57.007
Okay, that's it.

37:31.959 --> 37:34.001
Dan, we're gonna
move this down here.

37:34.002 --> 37:35.628
Okay.

37:35.629 --> 37:38.130
Clear everything off.

37:38.131 --> 37:41.133
Everything, please.

37:41.134 --> 37:42.094
Watch out, Dad.

37:42.427 --> 37:43.637
Can't mess it up.

37:44.972 --> 37:46.389
If one piece falls,

37:46.390 --> 37:47.808
it's gonna screw up the entire game.

37:48.016 --> 37:49.810
Don't screw up the entire game.

37:52.688 --> 37:56.482
You need to ask Mrs. DeFrancis
for a ride to practice Thursday.

37:56.483 --> 37:59.819
Not home from, to.
I can't do it.

37:59.820 --> 38:01.779
I know, I heard you.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.156
Dad's going to pick you up,
though, all right?

38:04.157 --> 38:05.950
- Okay.
- Right, right?

38:05.951 --> 38:07.703
Right.

39:21.568 --> 39:23.028
<i>- Mademoiselle.
- Merci.</i>

39:38.710 --> 39:40.754
<i>- Ah, oui?</i>
- Could I --

40:42.774 --> 40:45.401
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, it's me.

40:45.402 --> 40:47.320
<i>Hey, sweetheart.
How's the conference going?</i>

40:47.571 --> 40:51.073
Good, good, um...
It's--it's--it's going good.

40:51.074 --> 40:52.576
Everything okay?

40:53.660 --> 40:57.538
<i>Um, I... I don't want to,
uh, upset you.</i>

40:57.539 --> 40:58.874
I just, um...

41:00.584 --> 41:02.961
Have you read
the Unabomber manifesto yet?

41:04.004 --> 41:04.963
No.

41:06.339 --> 41:07.841
<i>I think you should.</i>

41:08.383 --> 41:10.302
<i>I think you should, um,</i>

41:11.011 --> 41:14.806
<i>go get</i> The Washington Post <i>and read it.</i>
