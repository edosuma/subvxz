[laughs]

00:57.432 --> 00:59.059
[Doc reading]

00:59.684 --> 01:02.562
Look. Dragons leap
through hoops!

01:03.188 --> 01:06.316
And Sir Kirby
walks on a tightrope!

01:06.733 --> 01:08.777
And my rescue
helicopter flies

01:08.860 --> 01:10.820
through the balloons
without popping them!

01:13.907 --> 01:15.408
Whoa! Ha ha ha!

01:16.034 --> 01:18.703
Donny, Luca,
you guys ready
for soccer practice?

01:19.370 --> 01:20.747
Yeah, soccer!
Oh, yeah!

01:20.830 --> 01:21.831
Whoo! Ha ha ha!

01:23.166 --> 01:25.376
Hey! Doc,
I'm going to leave
my helicopter here.

01:25.710 --> 01:28.004
Don't let anything
happen to it, okay?

01:28.338 --> 01:31.090
You can trust me, Luca.
I'm great with toys.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.092
You can ask any of them.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.138
I mean, you know...

01:37.597 --> 01:39.265
If they could talk.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.017
Which they can't.

01:41.768 --> 01:42.936
Have fun at soccer.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.729
Okay. Bye!

01:51.611 --> 01:52.654
[chuckles]

01:53.655 --> 01:54.531
Ha ha ha!

01:54.614 --> 01:56.116
Hey, it's Rescue Ronda!

01:56.950 --> 01:59.244
Ha ha! 'Tis good
to see you, valiant lady!

01:59.953 --> 02:02.122
It sure is good
to see you all.

02:02.372 --> 02:05.542
Doc, Doc, can we show
Ronda the circus trick
we've been working on?

02:06.126 --> 02:07.544
That's a great idea, Stuffy.

02:07.961 --> 02:08.961
Ha ha!

02:09.503 --> 02:10.964
Can I borrow your hat, Chilly?

02:11.047 --> 02:11.965
Oh! Sure.

02:12.507 --> 02:16.094
Ladies and gentlemen,
toys and girl,

02:16.302 --> 02:20.557
prepare to witness
The Flying Dragon!

02:20.974 --> 02:23.351
Flying dragon?
Sounds exciting!

02:23.810 --> 02:25.645
My friend Buddy
the dump truck...

02:25.979 --> 02:27.313
Ho ho! That's me.

02:27.397 --> 02:30.150
Will dump a load
of blocks onto
the see-saw,

02:30.483 --> 02:32.652
sending the fearless
Flying Dragon

02:33.278 --> 02:35.238
flying over a giant girl.

02:35.530 --> 02:39.450
Then the Dragon
will land on the fluffy
pillow of doom!

02:39.909 --> 02:40.910
-Hoo!
-Oh! Ooh!

02:40.994 --> 02:43.246
Hoo whee!
That sounds spectacular!

02:43.746 --> 02:44.831
Let's do it!

02:45.290 --> 02:46.332
Hit it, Buddy!

02:48.918 --> 02:49.919
Whoa-oh-oh!

02:50.461 --> 02:52.213
Whoa! Too high!

02:52.964 --> 02:53.965
Ugh!

02:55.758 --> 02:58.011
Oh, no.
I'm stuck on the roof!

02:58.678 --> 03:00.138
Help!

03:01.139 --> 03:03.099
Can't reach.

03:03.349 --> 03:07.353
Whoo whee!
This looks like a job
for Rescue Ronda.

03:07.604 --> 03:08.730
Stand back.

03:08.813 --> 03:11.482
Rescue Ronda to the rescue!

03:14.277 --> 03:15.320
Hold on tight.

03:15.695 --> 03:16.571
[straining]

03:16.654 --> 03:17.947
Here we go!

03:18.823 --> 03:20.366
Oh, don't forget my hat!

03:21.367 --> 03:22.368
Ugh!

03:22.952 --> 03:25.496
Whoa! Whoa!
We're wobbling!

03:26.539 --> 03:27.707
Oh, Mayday!

03:27.790 --> 03:29.000
Hold on, Stuffy.

03:29.083 --> 03:31.461
We're going to need to make
an emergency landing!

03:31.836 --> 03:33.421
Ooh, I can't watch!

03:33.713 --> 03:36.257
Stuffy, save yourself! Jump!

03:36.841 --> 03:37.800
[screams]

03:39.344 --> 03:40.803
Whoa! Whoa!

03:41.137 --> 03:42.639
Hey, I'm okay!

03:42.847 --> 03:44.515
Ronda totally saved me!

03:44.599 --> 03:46.059
Whoa!

03:47.310 --> 03:48.728
Oh! Whoa.

03:48.811 --> 03:50.521
Ronda, are you okay?

03:50.897 --> 03:54.609
That's a negative, Doc.
I think one of my rotors
is in bad shape.

03:54.817 --> 03:57.820
Oh, no! I promised Luca
I'd take care of you,

03:58.154 --> 03:59.322
and now you're hurt.

03:59.864 --> 04:01.532
We need to get you
a checkup.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.077
[Lambie] The Doc is in.

04:06.204 --> 04:07.580
Whoa!

04:11.584 --> 04:15.380
Gracious snakes alive, Doc,
what's all the commotion?

04:15.797 --> 04:17.089
Rescue Ronda's hurt.

04:17.339 --> 04:18.966
I need to get her fixed.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.969
I think you should
get the paste.

04:21.052 --> 04:21.886
Right away, Doc!

04:23.346 --> 04:24.639
Okay, Ronda.

04:24.722 --> 04:27.183
I need to see how badly
your rotor is broken.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.644
This might hurt
a little bit.

04:29.894 --> 04:31.187
I'll be brave, Doc.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.856
A rescue helicopter
always has to be brave!

04:34.857 --> 04:39.821
Ooh! That does hurt a smidge
right there, Doc.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.531
Sorry, Ronda.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.783
I'm trying my best
to be gentle.

04:44.158 --> 04:45.535
Here's that paste you wanted.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.203
Just in time, Hallie.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.705
I have a diagnosis.

04:49.038 --> 04:52.542
Good thing I also brought
<span style="style.default_1">The Big Book of Boo-boos!</span>

04:53.001 --> 04:56.212
Ronda, you've got a case
of roto crack-a-losis.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.589
That means
your rotor is broken.

04:58.798 --> 05:03.344
We need to fix it up,
and you'll be back in action
in time to go home with Luca.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.221
Good to hear it, Doc.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.098
Hallie, I'm going
to hold the rotor.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.351
You put some
paste in the crack,
but be gentle.

05:10.935 --> 05:14.647
Don't worry, Doc.
I'll be more gentle
than a bluebird at bedtime.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.066
Don't you worry.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.902
Doc is the best
toy doctor there is.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.743
Ronda, I think
we're done pasting.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.162
Hoo! Great news.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.622
But paste takes time to dry,

05:31.873 --> 05:34.751
so I need you to rest
your rotors for 30 minutes,

05:35.543 --> 05:37.420
or else you might
hurt yourself again.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.547
Well, Doc, a rescue helicopter

05:39.630 --> 05:43.134
never likes to take it easy,
but I'll give it a whirl.

05:43.217 --> 05:46.054
Maybe a little circus act
will help you pass the time?

05:46.345 --> 05:47.346
-Good idea!
-Yeah!

05:49.724 --> 05:51.434
Hat, please. Thank you!

05:51.684 --> 05:52.977
Huh?

05:53.644 --> 05:55.480
Prepare yourselves
once again

05:55.855 --> 05:59.484
to experience
The Flying Dragon!

06:00.068 --> 06:02.153
And I won't mess
it up this time.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.241
Whee!

06:07.992 --> 06:08.826
Ugh!

06:09.118 --> 06:11.496
And that's how
this dragon flies.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.625
You were amazing!

06:16.292 --> 06:17.418
-Oh!
-Whoa!

06:18.961 --> 06:20.630
Oh! Hey!

06:20.713 --> 06:21.964
[Doc] Sir Kirby!

06:22.548 --> 06:25.968
Rescue Ronda to the rescue!

06:26.052 --> 06:28.930
Wait, Ronda!
The paste isn't dry!

06:30.389 --> 06:31.724
Oh, no!

06:31.808 --> 06:33.518
My rotor's cracked again!

06:36.604 --> 06:37.605
Uh!

06:38.106 --> 06:39.065
Oh, no!

06:39.398 --> 06:40.566
Stay there, Ronda.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.777
I'll find Sir Kirby,
then be right back.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.362
[Stuffy] Doc, I got him!

06:44.821 --> 06:46.114
[groans]

06:50.409 --> 06:52.495
My thanks,
good Lady McStuffins.

06:52.995 --> 06:55.748
How embarrassing for a knight
to be saved by a...

06:56.457 --> 06:57.708
[whispers] by a dragon.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.586
Not to mention having
his head stuck inside a tomato!

07:01.087 --> 07:04.423
Yes. That is
embarrassing as well.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.384
[giggles]

07:06.467 --> 07:08.678
I better go check
on Rescue Ronda.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.348
Uh!

07:12.432 --> 07:14.142
Oh, man!

07:14.225 --> 07:16.811
Looks like my rotor needs
another round of fixing.

07:17.353 --> 07:18.646
Yep, it sure does.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.648
Lambie, could you
get Hallie and ask her

07:20.731 --> 07:22.191
to bring my--
Doctor bag?

07:22.525 --> 07:24.152
How do you
do that, Hallie?

07:24.652 --> 07:26.696
Hippo sense![giggles]

07:35.163 --> 07:38.749
I'm sorry, Doc.
I know you said
to rest my rotors,

07:38.833 --> 07:40.585
but I felt all better.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.420
I know you did, sugar,

07:42.795 --> 07:44.505
but when Doc says to rest,

07:44.922 --> 07:47.383
it's really important
that you follow her advice.

07:48.259 --> 07:51.429
When you get hurt,
you need to give yourself
time to get better.

07:51.929 --> 07:53.264
I know you're right, Doc,

07:53.514 --> 07:55.975
but it's just so hard
for a rescue helicopter

07:56.058 --> 07:58.769
to sit back when there's
rescuing to be done.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.356
I know how you feel.
One time, I hurt my foot

08:02.440 --> 08:05.359
and I couldn't play
in the championship
soccer game.

08:05.776 --> 08:07.945
I wanted to play so bad!

08:08.404 --> 08:10.781
Oh, no, Doc.
What did you do?

08:11.073 --> 08:13.659
I sat on the sidelines
to cheer on my friends

08:14.035 --> 08:17.121
because the doctor
told me to take it easy.

is going to rest

until you give me the a-okay.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.509
Good! That's what
I want to hear.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.806
Poor Ronda.

09:17.306 --> 09:20.893
Oh, she really hates
having to rest her rotors.

09:21.394 --> 09:25.189
I know. She's been
waiting so patiently
for her paste to dry,

09:25.648 --> 09:27.775
but she's still got
another couple minutes

09:28.025 --> 09:29.735
to wait before she can fly.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.529
I know what
would cheer her up.

09:31.612 --> 09:32.780
Balloons!

09:33.030 --> 09:35.032
Balloons can cheer up anyone!

09:37.034 --> 09:38.077
Oh! Oh! Oh!

09:38.160 --> 09:39.412
Oh, no! Help!

09:39.495 --> 09:40.580
Lambie!

09:40.663 --> 09:42.748
Oh, dear.
Lamb in the air!

09:43.124 --> 09:44.875
Oh, man!

09:44.959 --> 09:48.045
I know Doc said
I'm not supposed to fly,
but, shucks,

09:48.129 --> 09:50.131
I can't just sit around
and do nothing

09:50.214 --> 09:51.966
when there's rescuing
to be done!

09:52.174 --> 09:55.219
But you can't fly.
Doc said!

09:56.262 --> 09:58.556
[Lambie] Somebody... Help!

09:58.931 --> 10:00.600
I know I'm not
supposed to fly,

10:00.683 --> 10:03.561
but that doesn't mean I can't
help out in other ways.

10:05.187 --> 10:08.065
Rescue Ronda to the rescue!

10:08.316 --> 10:10.651
Stuffy, Sir Kirby,
Hallie, Chilly,

10:10.735 --> 10:12.570
grab that fluffy pillow!

10:13.070 --> 10:15.364
Hold on, Lambie.
Help's on the way!

10:15.823 --> 10:16.824
Hurry!

10:17.033 --> 10:20.995
Now, everyone grab
the corners and carry
the pillow under Lambie.

10:21.537 --> 10:24.332
Okay! I need you to let
go of the balloon.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.083
But I'll fall!

10:26.500 --> 10:29.211
I know, but your friends
will catch you!

10:29.462 --> 10:31.339
We won't let you down!

10:32.256 --> 10:33.674
It'll be okay, Lambie!

10:34.258 --> 10:36.093
If you say so, Doc.

10:36.927 --> 10:38.054
Whee!

10:39.221 --> 10:40.097
Safe!

10:40.931 --> 10:42.099
Uh!

10:44.435 --> 10:45.645
Thanks, Rescue Ronda.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.105
Your quick thinking
saved the day.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.524
That's what
rescue helicopters do!

10:51.025 --> 10:52.735
I'm proud of you, Ronda.

10:53.110 --> 10:56.364
You were able
to lead the rescue
and still rest your rotor.

10:56.906 --> 11:00.785
Speaking of doctor's orders,
it's been 30 minutes!

11:01.702 --> 11:04.372
And it looks like
the paste is all dried.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.667
I think it's time
for you to try to fly.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.585
Whoo hoo!

11:09.794 --> 11:11.837
You don't have to tell
this chopper twice.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.047
[Doc] Yay, Ronda!

11:13.339 --> 11:16.425
Oh, it's great
to be back in the air!

11:17.468 --> 11:20.554

11:35.194 --> 11:36.028
[Luca] Doc!

11:36.112 --> 11:37.571
We're back.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.324
Sounds like we got you
fixed just in time.

11:40.991 --> 11:42.660
Thanks a million, Doc.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.329
You're welcome
a million, Ronda!

11:46.622 --> 11:48.582
Did you take good care
of my helicopter?

11:48.958 --> 11:52.044
Luca, I'm really sorry.
The rotor got cracked

11:52.128 --> 11:54.422
when she was rescuing
Stuffy from the roof.

11:54.755 --> 11:57.550
But don't worry.
I fixed her up, good as new!

11:57.925 --> 11:58.884
Thanks, Doc!

11:58.968 --> 12:01.303
It's dangerous work being
a rescue helicopter,

12:01.720 --> 12:04.098
but I'm glad you
were around to fix it.

12:04.515 --> 12:07.268
Rescue helicopter, away!

12:10.855 --> 12:12.189
Whoo hoo!

12:16.819 --> 12:18.487
[Doc reading]

12:19.572 --> 12:21.031
I'll attach the hood.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.201
And I'll put on the wheels.

12:30.791 --> 12:32.543
[Dad] There! We're done.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.879
Wow! Thanks, Dad.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.381
Ooh, nice truck.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.550
I know. We made it!

12:39.800 --> 12:43.637
And we're going to enter it
in the Big Wheelie Dealie
contest in the park today.

12:43.971 --> 12:46.682
I think it could win the prize
for the best-looking truck.

12:47.057 --> 12:48.434
I think so, too.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.978
That'd be so cool!

12:51.479 --> 12:53.731
Can we put some flames
on the side, too?

12:53.814 --> 12:55.774
Sure. Which sticker
do you want?

12:56.150 --> 12:57.526
Oh, I like this one!

12:57.943 --> 12:59.612
Oh, I like this one, too!

13:00.112 --> 13:02.740
Or this one.
Or that one!

13:07.119 --> 13:09.288
Oh, and some racing stripes.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.418
That looks great.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.754
I'm going to call him...

13:17.296 --> 13:18.672
Tremaine.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.217
Thanks for helping me
make him, Dad.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.676
Sure thing.

13:24.303 --> 13:27.515
We'll leave for
the Big Wheelie Dealie
in about an hour.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.685
You want to see how fast
Tremaine can go?

13:31.936 --> 13:33.437
Sure. Let's test him out.

13:35.814 --> 13:37.525
And, in his first ever race,

13:37.775 --> 13:40.694
Tremaine the Truck
will show everyone
what he can do!

13:41.153 --> 13:44.532
Three, two, one... Go!

13:45.783 --> 13:47.576
Go, Tremaine!

13:47.952 --> 13:49.161
Go, Tremaine! Go, go!

13:50.162 --> 13:51.664
Oh, no!

13:53.624 --> 13:58.128
He was perfect looking,
and now he's all messed up!

13:58.504 --> 14:01.173
He'll never win
the Big Wheelie Dealie.

14:01.590 --> 14:05.177
I'm really sorry.
I know how hard
you worked on him.

14:05.844 --> 14:08.013
Do you think there's
any way to fix him?

14:08.597 --> 14:10.307
Let me see what I can do.

14:10.808 --> 14:14.144
Really?
That would be so cool.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.148
Thanks, Doc!

14:20.025 --> 14:21.610
The Doc is in!

14:27.992 --> 14:29.076
Hi, everyone.

14:29.910 --> 14:30.953
-Hey there, Doc!
-Hi!

14:32.037 --> 14:33.455
Howdy, folks!

14:34.248 --> 14:35.791
Wow! Look at him!

14:35.875 --> 14:36.917
[Chilly] He's going fast!

14:37.001 --> 14:38.252
Wow!

14:39.003 --> 14:40.504
Yeehaw!

14:40.713 --> 14:44.133
This is some mighty nice
riding space y'all got here!

14:44.425 --> 14:45.426
Ooh!

14:46.468 --> 14:48.929
Um... Who is that?

14:54.101 --> 14:58.355
The name's Tremaine,
and trucking's my game!

14:58.647 --> 15:00.858
Hi, Tremaine. I'm Stuffy,

15:00.941 --> 15:03.736
and being a brave dragon
is my game.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.654
But I also like checkers.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.615
Well, howdy, Stuffy.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.075
My name is Doc McStuffins.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.995
-Nice to meet you.
-Whoa!

15:13.078 --> 15:14.705
Slow down there, cowboy.

15:17.124 --> 15:19.043
Whoo whee!

15:19.126 --> 15:21.712
That jump right there
has my name on it!

15:22.421 --> 15:24.506
Hmm. I don't see
anything written here.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.598
Whoa, yeah!

15:33.933 --> 15:35.309
Whoo whee!

15:35.392 --> 15:37.311
That was sweet!

15:38.103 --> 15:39.146
Huh!

15:39.229 --> 15:41.273
Hold on for one
truck-loving minute here.

15:41.815 --> 15:44.526
What's that on...
On my side?

15:44.610 --> 15:45.527
Oh!

15:46.612 --> 15:51.992
Um... It looks
like you've got a few
itsy-bitsy little scratches.

15:52.242 --> 15:55.287
Aw, man,
those are scratches!

15:55.663 --> 15:57.247
That's why I brought you here.

15:57.539 --> 15:59.083
I think I can help you.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.960
Well, thank you
kindly, Doc.

16:01.251 --> 16:03.337
Your brother Donny
and that pop of yours

16:03.420 --> 16:05.923
really wanted me
to look shiny and new

16:06.006 --> 16:07.925
for that Big Wheelie Dealie.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.677
Oh...

16:09.760 --> 16:13.472
But now, I don't look
shiny or new.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.809
We'll make you better.
Let's start with a checkup.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.435
Yeah, yeah, sure, Doc.

16:18.519 --> 16:21.814
But first, I want to have
a go at those blocks.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.107
But we need to...

16:24.108 --> 16:26.235
Yeehaw!

16:26.568 --> 16:29.113
You're very good
at block-knocking,
sweet wheels,

16:29.488 --> 16:32.908
but we need you
to chill out so we can
get you checked out!

16:33.117 --> 16:35.619
Oh! Okay, ma'am.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.247
I'm just not used
to being quiet, is all.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.832

17:10.654 --> 17:12.031
I have a diagnosis.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.950
You have
the scratchy scrapies!

17:15.034 --> 17:16.117
-Huh!
-Oh!

17:16.201 --> 17:17.744
Wow whee!

17:18.078 --> 17:20.998
That sounds bad.
Is there any way to fix it?

17:21.540 --> 17:24.667
Yep. All we have to do
is paint over the scratches.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.546
Then you need to wait
for it to dry,

17:27.628 --> 17:29.506
and you'll look
as good as new.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.551
Cowboy, you might even
look better than new.

17:32.926 --> 17:35.763
I like the sound of that!

17:36.221 --> 17:38.098
Paint me up!

17:38.390 --> 17:40.434
Yeehaw!

17:43.187 --> 17:44.855
Yoo-hoo! Over here!

17:49.193 --> 17:50.736
Many thanks, little lady.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.113
I sure do hope this works.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.783
Cloth.
Cloth.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.579
Paintbrush.
Paintbrush.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.964
Tremaine, I have really
steady hands, like my mom,

18:11.590 --> 18:13.133
which is good for a doctor,

18:13.217 --> 18:16.345
but painting these stripes
is still going to be hard.

18:16.845 --> 18:19.807
If you move at all,
I might mess them up.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.601
So, you got to stay still.

18:22.976 --> 18:25.270
Want a shot at winning
the Big Wheelie Dealie?

18:25.562 --> 18:26.980
I sure do, ma'am.

18:27.064 --> 18:29.233
Then listen up,
and don't move!

18:29.733 --> 18:31.693
I'm still. I'm still.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.237
I'm not moving.

18:33.320 --> 18:36.240
I'm staying still,
staying in the same place.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.617
Oh, this is hard.
I am still.

18:45.165 --> 18:49.044
Wow, wow!
Those stripes
are styling, Doc!

18:49.503 --> 18:52.172
Yeehaw!

18:52.256 --> 18:55.509
Wait, Tremaine!
You need to stay calm
until it dries.

18:55.592 --> 18:56.635
Oh, no!

18:56.718 --> 18:58.303
-[Stuffy] Watch out!
-[Chilly] Watch out!

18:59.763 --> 19:01.140
Huh?

19:05.477 --> 19:08.188
Hopping horseflies!
Did I do that?

19:08.397 --> 19:09.565
[knocking]

19:09.648 --> 19:12.192
[Donny] Doc, it's almost time
for the Big Wheelie Dealie.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.360
That's Donny!
Go stuffed!

19:16.155 --> 19:17.489
You, too.

19:18.782 --> 19:19.867
Come in!

19:20.659 --> 19:23.203
It's almost time to go
to the Big Wheelie Dealie.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.080
How's Tremaine looking?

19:26.582 --> 19:27.833
I'm still working on it.

19:28.292 --> 19:29.960
[Donny] Will he be
ready in time?

19:30.043 --> 19:32.713
[Doc] I think so, but you got
to let me work.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.425
I'll meet you
in the backyard
in a little while.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.427
Okay, okay.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.308
Whew, that was close!

19:44.892 --> 19:47.019
Tremaine, Donny is
counting on you,

19:47.728 --> 19:51.356
but the only way
you can win best-looking
in the Big Wheelie Dealie

19:51.815 --> 19:54.151
is if you stay still
and let me work.

19:54.610 --> 19:58.363
Well, gosh, I surely don't
want to let Donny down,

19:58.947 --> 20:00.199
or your pops.

20:00.949 --> 20:05.245
I'll do
whatever it takes, Doc.
That's what I want to hear.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.830
-There you go!
-That's great!

20:08.832 --> 20:10.918
Roll up here, and...

20:11.001 --> 20:12.211
-Don't move.
-Don't move.

20:14.046 --> 20:18.008
Okay. Holding still,
holding still.

20:23.597 --> 20:25.849
Oh, this is mighty hard!

20:27.351 --> 20:30.729
Yeehaw!

Okay.

21:06.682 --> 21:09.017
Great job keeping calm
and holding still.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.436
As long as I didn't
think about it,

21:11.645 --> 21:13.355
it was easy as pie!

21:13.814 --> 21:15.274
Now, this time,

21:15.524 --> 21:17.818
we're going to put
a bandage over the scratch

21:17.901 --> 21:20.445
so the paint stays
clean while it dries.

21:22.906 --> 21:25.117
Do I need to hold
still while it dries?

21:25.492 --> 21:28.620
Nope. This bandage should
keep it safe and clean.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.915
Now we just have to wait
for the paint to dry.

21:33.875 --> 21:35.460
I'm going to do some laps.

21:35.752 --> 21:38.130
Yeehaw!

21:38.213 --> 21:39.047
I'll count!

21:39.298 --> 21:42.551
One, two, three, four...

21:42.634 --> 21:47.306
Fifty-four, fifty-five,
fifty-six.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.683
It's time to take off
your bandage.

21:49.766 --> 21:55.188
Already? That was faster
than a pig can find a mud pie.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.316
Ooh, I can't wait
to see this!

22:03.363 --> 22:04.698
Ooh!
Ooh!

22:05.282 --> 22:06.742
Well, how about that?

22:07.242 --> 22:08.827
I do look better than new!

22:09.077 --> 22:11.079
Your scratchy scrapies
are cured!

22:12.581 --> 22:14.916
Well, then, I got
two things to say.

22:15.375 --> 22:18.754
Thanks and yeehaw!

22:19.421 --> 22:20.922
Let's do this thing!

22:21.006 --> 22:22.883
-Good luck!
-You can do it!

22:24.926 --> 22:27.763
Here you go, Donny.
Yeah, I fixed him.

22:28.221 --> 22:29.973
I knew you could do it!

22:30.724 --> 22:33.602
Wow, he looks great!

22:34.061 --> 22:35.145
Better than great!

22:35.562 --> 22:37.731
Hey, the Big Wheelie Dealie
is about to start.

22:38.273 --> 22:40.233
Come on.
Let's go enter Tremaine.

22:40.442 --> 22:41.693
There's still time!

22:43.945 --> 22:45.280
Donny, wait up!

22:56.708 --> 22:59.336
When do you think they're
going to give out the prizes?

22:59.419 --> 23:00.337
Soon.

23:00.837 --> 23:03.799
Even if Tremaine doesn't
win anything, it's okay.

23:04.257 --> 23:05.759
I think he looks good.

23:06.176 --> 23:07.219
Me too.

23:07.302 --> 23:10.722
[announcer] <span style="style.default_1">And the winners</span>
<span style="style.default_1">for best-looking are...</span>

23:11.098 --> 23:14.392
<span style="style.default_1">Tremaine the truck</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and Donny McStuffins!</span>

23:14.810 --> 23:16.978
 Yeah, Donny!
 Yay! Donny won!

23:17.062 --> 23:18.855
Hooray! I won!

23:18.939 --> 23:20.524
Yay!

23:20.816 --> 23:23.235
-Whoo!
-Go, Donny! Yay!

23:23.318 --> 23:24.277
Yeah!

23:24.528 --> 23:26.071
[chuckles]

23:26.279 --> 23:28.573
I couldn't have done
it without you, Doc.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.955
Hey, everybody.
It's Doc here.

23:35.205 --> 23:37.165
<span style="style.default_1">Luca got a splinter</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in his finger.</span>

23:37.457 --> 23:39.793
<span style="style.default_1">What should you do</span>
<span style="style.default_1">if you get a splinter?</span>

23:39.876 --> 23:40.710
Stomp! Stomp!

23:40.794 --> 23:42.087
[Doc] <span style="style.default_1">Should you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">play dragon stomp</span>

23:42.170 --> 23:43.922
<span style="style.default_1">and knock down all your blocks?</span>

23:46.383 --> 23:49.010
<span style="style.default_1">Should you tell an adult</span>
<span style="style.default_1">so they can remove the splinter?</span>

23:50.387 --> 23:53.306
<span style="style.default_1">Should you play a game</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of "Throw cotton balls</span>
<span style="style.default_1">at Stuffy's tummy"?</span>

23:55.267 --> 23:58.353
<span style="style.default_1">That's right. Get an adult</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to remove the splinter.</span>
