00:18.760 --> 00:22.320
- Destination, Monsieur?
- Monte Carlo.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.040
Give it to me in English!

03:09.160 --> 03:12.280
- Sure. We’re lost.
- Thanks.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.560
Hey!

03:13.680 --> 03:16.040
- Herbie!
- What’s he doing?

03:18.720 --> 03:21.000
He’s getting us un-lost!

03:24.400 --> 03:29.480
Hi there! Say, we’re looking for
the Trans-France Race Exposition.

03:29.600 --> 03:34.600
Straight ahead on your
right. That’ll be some race, huh?

03:34.720 --> 03:36.840
You’re looking at the winner, here!

03:36.960 --> 03:39.040
This car? The winner?

03:44.720 --> 03:46.600
- He didn’t?
- He did.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.320
All this for the museum payroll?

04:09.440 --> 04:14.360
For the most magnificent diamond
in the world! "L’Etoile de Joie!"

04:14.480 --> 04:17.678
Could we have just a little peek?

04:17.798 --> 04:22.239
On this very afternoon
at one o’clock precisely!

04:22.359 --> 04:26.399
You and all of Paris
will be able to take the peek!

04:37.920 --> 04:41.079
Fresh from his triumphs
on the European racing circuit,

04:41.200 --> 04:43.320
Bruno von Stickle!

04:43.440 --> 04:47.880
Who will be driving
his Lazer 91 7 GT Coupe.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.679
Here we have a magnificent...
The American entry is just arriving!

04:52.799 --> 04:54.239
Mr Jim Douglas...

04:57.119 --> 05:02.640
Mr Douglas will be driving a... a...

05:06.559 --> 05:10.320
Mr Douglas will be driving
a most unusual entry.

05:13.519 --> 05:15.559
Something funny
must have happened.

05:15.679 --> 05:17.000
Uh-huh. Us.

05:17.119 --> 05:22.519
How about giving Jim Douglas and
Wheely Applegate a nice welcome?

05:27.480 --> 05:33.559
This little car is the toast
of America. When was your last win?

05:33.679 --> 05:35.480
12 years ago.

05:36.399 --> 05:39.760
Only because that was our last race.

05:43.239 --> 05:46.359
Yes. This race... we’re kind of
staging a comeback here.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.320
So it’s very important to us.

05:48.440 --> 05:52.920
Of course, we won’t be coming back
very far unless we qualify, will we?

05:53.480 --> 05:56.079
Qualify, are you kidding?

05:56.200 --> 06:00.880
Don’t let his modesty or this car
coming out of retirement fool you!

06:01.000 --> 06:04.119
There isn’t a finer tuned,
cleaner engine anywhere!

06:04.239 --> 06:07.440
I’m sure it should be easy
to keep clean.

06:07.559 --> 06:11.440
All you have to do is drop it in
the washing machine with your socks.

06:15.720 --> 06:20.040
Appreciate your humour, but don’t
worry about this washing m... car!

06:21.519 --> 06:23.239
It’s a real jewel!

06:29.399 --> 06:33.320
But M Ribeaux, isn’t it too much
responsibility for one man?

06:34.320 --> 06:39.640
One man? One man and the finest
security system that can be devised!

06:39.760 --> 06:41.880
All in the computer.

06:43.399 --> 06:47.279
This alone would keep the diamonds
safe from the grasp of a thief!

06:47.399 --> 06:49.760
But, one would only
have to reach in and...

07:02.359 --> 07:06.200
The pillow is sensitive to the heat
of the hand when it gets close.

07:06.320 --> 07:08.480
I’m sorry, monsieur.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.359
What does that do?

07:34.480 --> 07:38.799
I’m engaging a system of
electric-eye beams that surround it.

07:39.760 --> 07:45.640
One last precaution. Would you
please step out of the room?

07:59.119 --> 08:02.359
Now the entire floor is a trap!

08:02.480 --> 08:04.839
Mere cigar ash
would activate the alarm.

08:30.359 --> 08:31.799
Right on schedule!

08:31.920 --> 08:34.799
Only ten steps
to six million dollars!

08:34.919 --> 08:38.558
And one step to Devil’s Island
if anything touches that floor.

08:49.280 --> 08:53.520
Pardon, you forgot to give me
the computer and the numbers?

08:53.640 --> 08:58.520
I did not forget. They were put
in my trust and will remain with me!

08:58.640 --> 09:03.239
One does not part
with the only copy in existence!

09:05.840 --> 09:09.039
Patience, Quincy.
Electronics is the answer.

09:09.159 --> 09:12.559
This notebook
is our passport to the future.

09:12.679 --> 09:15.359
I’d sooner put my trust
in this bit of rope!

09:27.280 --> 09:31.719
When the man has it all worked out
for us, it’s silly not to use it.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.840
You had to bring the whole kit,
didn’t you?

09:44.960 --> 09:47.159
Just checking for the radar beam.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.200
It’s there.

09:50.440 --> 09:51.359
Now it isn’t.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.119
Some chunk of rock, eh?

10:03.239 --> 10:06.919
One could spend a lifetime without
setting eyes on a rock like that.

10:07.039 --> 10:11.280
Let alone getting your hands on it.
Patience, Quincy.

10:11.400 --> 10:15.799
The pillow is the trap.
One more set of numbers.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.400
Why can’t a man write an 0
that looks like an 0?

10:22.159 --> 10:26.039
Or is it a 9?
We can’t take a chance!

10:27.880 --> 10:31.239
I don’t trust nobody!
I’m glad I come prepared!

10:31.359 --> 10:33.119
The old ways are still the best!

10:34.559 --> 10:37.479
We’ve got six minutes
before the guard checks.

10:37.599 --> 10:38.919
Get on with it.

11:01.559 --> 11:04.239
Aren’t you ever going to
get that thing fixed?

11:05.840 --> 11:07.200
Oh! I’m sorry!

11:07.320 --> 11:08.760
I’m sorry!

11:10.400 --> 11:13.640
Excuse me! I just...

11:14.479 --> 11:15.440
Jim?

11:27.520 --> 11:30.000
A word to the wise.

11:30.119 --> 11:35.599
Paris may be the land of love, but It
can also be the land of heartbreak.

11:35.719 --> 11:40.039
I tell you what I’ll do.
I’ll make a deal with you.

11:40.159 --> 11:42.960
I’m willing
to resist the girls if you are.

11:43.080 --> 11:45.159
Well, that’s some sacrifice!

11:45.280 --> 11:47.960
I know. But I’m willing to make it.

11:48.080 --> 11:50.080
You’re made of strong stuff, Wheely.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.400
Patience, Quincy!

12:04.440 --> 12:08.039
You tell that to the guard!
He’ll be here in two minutes.

12:09.320 --> 12:10.280
Gimme that!

12:15.320 --> 12:18.320
We’re coming to this big
right-hand sweeper, see.

12:18.440 --> 12:21.960
Dropped into third gear
and jumped on it! Took three cars!

12:22.080 --> 12:25.960
Just hit the straight. Then back into
fourth and we were flying!

12:26.080 --> 12:28.119
Tacking seven or eight thousand.

12:28.239 --> 12:31.599
We blew off the lead car
about 100 yards from the finish line...

12:31.719 --> 12:35.400
and won it going away!
How about that?

12:37.679 --> 12:38.679
Huh?

12:46.320 --> 12:48.159
I didn’t understand what he said.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.880
That’s OK.
He didn’t understand you either.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.159
Come to think of it,
I don’t think I did!

12:55.039 --> 12:58.039
There’s no time!
That guard’s practically in the door!

12:58.159 --> 13:00.119
You want that stone, don’t you?

13:01.239 --> 13:04.119
Yeah.
And there’s only one way to get it!

13:23.280 --> 13:25.400
It’s not possible!

13:53.200 --> 13:58.320
{y:i}Attention, attention! Nobody
{y:i}is to leave the area. I repeat...

13:59.359 --> 14:01.599
We still have to qualify! Come on!

14:02.880 --> 14:05.039
- What’s the trouble?
- I don’t know!

14:05.159 --> 14:06.719
{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen...

14:06.840 --> 14:09.159
{y:i}there has been a theft in the museum!

14:09.280 --> 14:13.719
{y:i}Everyone will be searched
{y:i}before leaving the area.

14:16.719 --> 14:21.640
{y:i}I repeat, nobody is to leave the area
{y:i}until you have been searched.

14:21.760 --> 14:25.000
Here, mate... there’s no point
us both getting caught!

14:30.640 --> 14:32.840
No point either of us
getting caught.

14:41.799 --> 14:45.320
{y:i}I repeat,
{y:i}nobody is to leave the area.

14:48.359 --> 14:53.359
{y:i}I repeat, nobody is to leave the area
{y:i}until he has been searched.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.719
We’ll never see it again!

15:10.840 --> 15:12.640
That little car? You can.

15:12.760 --> 15:16.559
It’ll be in a showroom on
the Champs Elysees this afternoon.

15:22.559 --> 15:23.840
Yes, yes, yes.

15:23.960 --> 15:29.760
But are you sure all the security
precautions had been taken?

15:29.880 --> 15:33.479
I have searched my memory.
Could I have forgotten something?

15:33.599 --> 15:35.799
Inspector, residue from a footprint.

15:35.919 --> 15:39.119
I might have overlooked it but
I heard your voice calling...

15:39.239 --> 15:42.400
”Fontenoy, remember,
no clue is too small!”

15:42.520 --> 15:47.479
Did you also hear me say, “Take it
to the lab and get it analysed!”?

15:47.599 --> 15:50.559
Yes, sir! And I am doing just that!

16:00.679 --> 16:04.880
No! No, I couldn’t
have forgotten anything!

16:05.000 --> 16:09.320
I’m as sure the security was on
yesterday as I’m sure it’s off today!

16:12.840 --> 16:14.799
Fontenoy!

16:16.760 --> 16:22.479
{y:i}Attention, please! The qualifying
{y:i}rounds will begin in eight minutes!

16:33.400 --> 16:34.799
Douglas and Applegate.

16:34.919 --> 16:38.840
Douglas... Oh, yes!
You’re in the heat after this one.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.559
Good luck!

16:40.679 --> 16:41.799
Thank you!

16:41.919 --> 16:44.039
That’s the same heat I’m in, Douglas.

16:44.159 --> 16:48.080
You’re going to need more than luck.
You’re going to need wings!

16:48.200 --> 16:52.320
Oh, yeah? You may
just be in for a little surprise.

16:53.359 --> 16:57.719
I can see your surprise.
It is very little.

17:13.598 --> 17:16.079
Look for a bigger surprise
in the race!

17:19.040 --> 17:21.560
There will be qualifying today
and tomorrow...

17:21.680 --> 17:26.160
with the top sixteen times
running in the Trans-France race.

17:59.760 --> 18:03.079
Douglas, you are not
in this heat! Come back!

18:05.760 --> 18:08.319
Say, Herbie, where you going?

18:44.839 --> 18:48.599
- You could get us disqualified!
- He could get us killed!

18:59.800 --> 19:00.880
What...?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.719
- What was that?
- I don’t know!

19:10.760 --> 19:12.520
Forget the music!

19:20.040 --> 19:22.719
He’s out of his mind!

19:22.839 --> 19:27.880
He’s out of his mind, alright!
Over that luscious little Lancia!

19:35.959 --> 19:38.199
What is...?

19:42.439 --> 19:45.520
I’m telling you, Paris and women
have got him!

19:45.640 --> 19:48.160
I’ll have to warn him,
the same way I did you!

19:48.280 --> 19:52.000
Like father, like car.
What are you doing?

20:44.079 --> 20:47.520
- Now wait a minute, buddy...
- Whaddaya mean, buddy?

20:47.640 --> 20:50.680
- Miss Buddy!
- You... you...

20:50.800 --> 20:52.520
Jim Douglas. I’m very sorry...

20:52.640 --> 20:58.680
You think because I’m a woman driver,
you can get away with anything?

20:58.800 --> 21:01.199
I’m not a pigeon
for your fun and games!

21:01.319 --> 21:03.839
I’ve had it with you clowns!

21:03.959 --> 21:06.160
No, I’m not the clown!
Believe me, it was Herbie!

21:06.280 --> 21:09.199
Oh, yes.
You’re blaming your dizzy mechanic!

21:09.319 --> 21:10.800
No, no, it’s...

21:12.479 --> 21:16.400
Herbie’s the car.
And he’s kind of like a person.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.760
He’s... I know that sounds funny.

21:18.880 --> 21:22.160
Crazy is more like it!

21:22.280 --> 21:24.599
What were you doing out there,
Douglas?

21:24.719 --> 21:26.560
It’s hard to explain!

21:26.680 --> 21:29.199
Not for me.
He doesn’t want a woman in the race!

21:29.319 --> 21:33.560
Miss Darcy, you’ll get another
chance to qualify. We’re very sorry.

21:33.680 --> 21:37.319
You’re sorry. He’s sorry.
Everyone’s sorry!

21:37.439 --> 21:39.400
But I didn’t qualify!

21:40.839 --> 21:46.199
If you wish to qualify, M Douglas,
you have exactly ten minutes!

21:46.319 --> 21:48.319
You hear that, Herbie?

21:48.439 --> 21:51.280
Forget that powderpuff
and get your mind on racing!

21:51.400 --> 21:52.959
You better believe it.

21:55.280 --> 21:56.599
Gilbert...

21:57.880 --> 22:01.560
We’re going to cook that chicken,
European-style.

22:01.680 --> 22:05.599
When he sticks out his neck,
we will chop it off.

22:10.160 --> 22:15.079
We’ll see whose neck
gets chopped off! Right, Herbie?

22:49.199 --> 22:51.920
You better close your mouth, turkey!

22:52.040 --> 22:55.880
You’re gonna get our tyre marks
across your teeth!

23:04.560 --> 23:07.280
- Where’d they go?
- I really got snookered!

23:07.400 --> 23:09.239
I’m even rustier than I thought!

23:14.160 --> 23:16.560
Hey, Herbie, what are you doing?

23:17.599 --> 23:18.800
It’s her again!

23:21.839 --> 23:23.640
Oh, no!

23:34.800 --> 23:41.160
Well, it took a crowd to do it,
but at least we lost the Lancia!

23:42.719 --> 23:46.880
Not to mention
the first qualifying round.

23:56.839 --> 23:59.760
- Did you get hold of Double-X?
- He wasn’t very happy!

23:59.880 --> 24:02.680
Who is?
Where is that stupid little car?

24:02.800 --> 24:05.079
Patience! Excuse me, sir.

24:05.199 --> 24:08.959
Impressive racing cars, but I don’t
seem to see the little Volkswagen.

24:09.079 --> 24:14.839
Ah, the Douglas car? It will
be here. Patience, my friends!

24:14.959 --> 24:18.280
If one more person
says “patience” to me...!

24:18.400 --> 24:21.040
If we don’t turn up
with that diamond...

24:21.160 --> 24:24.040
Double-X will mark
the spot where we’re buried!

24:25.079 --> 24:28.719
Here, here.
Don’t dig our graves just yet.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.880
Come on. Let’s grab it.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.640
Don’t tell me patience!

24:43.760 --> 24:47.439
In front of 1 00 witnesses?
We need a plan.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.760
{y:i}Attention, everyone!

24:49.880 --> 24:53.880
We’d like to show you a film
of the route the cars will take

24:54.000 --> 24:55.800
when they leave Paris.

24:55.920 --> 24:59.479
If someone will catch the lights
while I draw the drapes...?

25:00.959 --> 25:04.119
I think the gentleman
just gave us a plan.

25:20.160 --> 25:21.880
The fine machines you see here

25:22.000 --> 25:24.640
will be among those
testing the gruelling route

25:24.760 --> 25:27.199
twisting through the French Alps...

25:27.319 --> 25:29.800
That’s it. Back up slowly.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.680
As if nothing was the matter.

25:32.800 --> 25:38.479
..pick up speed as they race along
the French countryside.

25:42.719 --> 25:47.959
...the challenge that becomes evident
as we approach the French Alps..

25:48.079 --> 25:52.439
It’s not here, Max.
The car’s just not here.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.199
...even the sturdiest of cars.

25:54.319 --> 25:56.880
Perhaps
we’re backing in the wrong direction?

25:57.000 --> 25:59.199
Just keep backing up!

25:59.319 --> 26:06.160
...for Monte Carlo. And for someone,
victory is just a step away!

26:14.839 --> 26:16.640
- Herbie!
- You mean no Herbie!

26:16.760 --> 26:18.719
Excuse me! Excuse me!

31:26.359 --> 31:27.959
My car?

31:29.000 --> 31:31.560
My car! Has anybody seen my car?

31:31.680 --> 31:33.760
Oh! That was your car?

31:33.880 --> 31:36.959
Yes, yes! It’s gone!

31:37.079 --> 31:38.880
Yes, it’s gone.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.719
Did you see who took it?

31:40.839 --> 31:42.640
Not exactly, mademoiselle.

31:42.760 --> 31:44.760
Excuse me, I hate to bother you...

31:44.880 --> 31:49.199
You! I should have known I’d see you.
You and trouble go together!

31:49.319 --> 31:55.199
Yeah, OK. We’ve lost our car.
I’d like to know if you’ve seen it.

31:55.319 --> 31:59.319
Who cares about your Volkswagen?
My Lancia has been stolen!

31:59.439 --> 32:02.199
- Stolen?
- Your car?

32:04.400 --> 32:06.800
- And your car?
- Yeah.

32:09.439 --> 32:11.199
I saw them both.

32:11.319 --> 32:13.680
Then you saw who stole them!

32:13.800 --> 32:18.000
You would not believe this!
I would not believe this!

32:18.119 --> 32:19.920
No-one would believe this!

32:20.040 --> 32:21.160
What?

32:21.280 --> 32:24.199
I think they steal each other!

32:26.599 --> 32:28.319
Come on!

32:28.439 --> 32:30.280
Taxi!

32:33.199 --> 32:34.439
Cuckoo!

32:35.439 --> 32:38.040
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

33:01.959 --> 33:05.160
Talk about a needle in a haystack!
How we gonna find ‘em?

33:05.280 --> 33:09.880
- I don’t know.Just keep looking.
- My life is riding on that car!

33:10.000 --> 33:12.880
Lady, I got
a few things to prove myself.

33:15.199 --> 33:18.239
Where’d you take
a boyfriend in Paris?

33:18.359 --> 33:22.079
Boyfriend...? Don’t tell me this
is your cute way of making a pass?

33:22.199 --> 33:25.119
If I had romance in mind,
would he be along?

33:25.239 --> 33:26.319
Right!

33:27.520 --> 33:31.920
- It’s Herbie.
- Herbie? I don’t believe this!

33:32.040 --> 33:35.239
Well, it’s true! There’s something
about that car. He’s got...

33:37.280 --> 33:39.560
Well, we’ve been through
a lot together.

33:39.680 --> 33:42.160
Nothing like this!

34:07.119 --> 34:10.879
Do you think
this is something to laugh about?

34:11.000 --> 34:13.320
Forgive me, I laugh at the radio.

34:13.438 --> 34:16.840
Two cars, they take a ride
on the bateau-mouche!

34:16.958 --> 34:20.320
- Would you believe such a thing?
- Bateau-mouche...

34:20.438 --> 34:22.478
Take a left at that bridge!

34:49.879 --> 34:53.199
Maybe I can explain this
over dinner tonight.

34:55.199 --> 34:57.000
Maybe not.

35:03.399 --> 35:04.879
I don’t know, Herbie.

35:05.679 --> 35:08.959
12 years is a long time.

35:09.080 --> 35:10.879
Hope we can handle it.

35:12.600 --> 35:14.639
Hope I can handle it.

35:16.360 --> 35:20.760
Well, all taken care of,Jim.
Had a little talk with Herbie.

35:20.879 --> 35:22.439
Had to straighten him out.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.679
I don’t mind a car with a heart.

35:24.800 --> 35:27.919
But I will not tolerate a car
falling for another car!

35:28.040 --> 35:33.000
What did you expect him to fall
in love with? The Goodyear blimp?

35:33.120 --> 35:36.800
I said, “Listen, Herbie!
We’re over here for one thing only!

35:36.919 --> 35:40.280
That’s to make the biggest comeback
in racing history!

35:40.399 --> 35:42.679
So no women in training camp!

35:42.800 --> 35:45.639
You just forget that little chick,
and you can do it.

35:45.760 --> 35:48.360
Just a matter of mind over metal!”

35:53.040 --> 35:55.320
- You expecting company?
- No.

35:56.919 --> 36:02.080
Detective Fontenoy here. And this is
the famous Inspector Bouchet!

36:02.199 --> 36:06.479
I’m Jim Douglas and this
is my partner, Wheely Applegate.

36:06.600 --> 36:10.560
If there’s a problem about our car
cruising on the bateau-mouche...

36:10.679 --> 36:14.959
Bateau-mouche? No, it’s about
the $6-million diamond stolen today.

36:15.080 --> 36:17.520
Perhaps the most lovely diamond
in the world!

36:17.639 --> 36:20.120
- Fontenoy!
- No?

36:21.239 --> 36:24.479
We are questioning everyone
who was in the area at the time.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.439
Perhaps you can help us.

36:49.719 --> 36:52.800
Pushing the car won’t help me
get the cap off!

36:53.520 --> 36:54.719
Must have rolled.

36:54.840 --> 36:57.840
Well, pull the handbrake on!

37:04.800 --> 37:08.879
- Door’s locked.
- Put your hand through the window!

37:20.199 --> 37:22.000
Let me get at it!

37:24.000 --> 37:27.800
I’m gonna hot-wire this car.
We’ll get the diamond at the garage.

37:33.280 --> 37:38.000
Well, I’m not waiting.
Car, it’s either you or me!

37:51.000 --> 37:54.320
I suppose you’re gonna tell me
that car drove away by itself!

37:54.439 --> 37:57.760
No, and I’m not gonna tell
Double-X that, either!

38:29.600 --> 38:31.840
What’s happening?

38:31.959 --> 38:35.639
There’s seven cars ahead and
we’re last, that’s what’s happening!

38:38.760 --> 38:40.000
Darcy.

38:40.120 --> 38:43.520
- Qualifying today?
- I hope so!

38:48.199 --> 38:51.919
New Herbie? He’s not even an old
Herbie! He’s not any Herbie at all!

38:52.040 --> 38:54.840
My lecture must have
fallen on a deaf carburettor.

38:54.959 --> 38:58.800
He doesn’t need a lecture, he needs
a pension! Now you listen, Herbie!

38:58.919 --> 39:03.080
We didn’t come out of mothballs to be
the laughingstock of the continent.

39:03.199 --> 39:05.719
Get the lead out of your pants
right now.

39:05.840 --> 39:10.760
Or I’ll ship you home, have you hung
on a wall in Retirement Village!

39:37.120 --> 39:39.679
Now you’re talking.
We got the old Herbie back!

39:39.800 --> 39:43.199
The old Herbie
and the new Herbie rolled into one!

40:06.159 --> 40:09.800
I’m telling you, it’s the old Herbie
and he’s doing it for us!

40:12.679 --> 40:16.600
He’s not doing it for us.
He’s doing it for her.

40:27.679 --> 40:31.000
OK. So he did it for her.

40:34.239 --> 40:38.120
Look at that! I never saw
anything like that in my life.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.679
- Congratulations, you did it!
- Thank you!

40:51.800 --> 40:55.040
- Well, somebody did it!
- Who cares? It’s hello, comeback!

40:55.159 --> 40:58.560
A record time for this track.
You shattered von Stickle’s mark!

40:58.679 --> 41:00.879
Congratulations, Douglas.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.800
You have just won the right
to taste my dust tomorrow.

41:03.919 --> 41:06.239
And mine, Douglas.

41:06.360 --> 41:08.159
Today you break my record.

41:08.280 --> 41:12.399
Tomorrow, I will turn
your “hello, comeback”

41:12.520 --> 41:15.919
into goodbye for ever.
{y:i}Auf Wiedersehen.

41:19.280 --> 41:22.840
- Couple of charm-school dropouts!
- Yeah.

42:19.560 --> 42:24.800
Well, one showboat deserves another.
I’ll go get him.

42:27.719 --> 42:30.080
{y:i}Felicitations.

42:31.360 --> 42:35.040
- Absolutely amazing!
- I knew I had a good car, but...

42:35.159 --> 42:38.360
The exact same time
as the Douglas car! A track record!

42:38.479 --> 42:40.239
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

42:40.360 --> 42:42.399
And thanks
for staying off the track.

42:42.520 --> 42:45.040
It’s one way
I can prove what I can do.

42:45.159 --> 42:47.159
Well, it wasn’t exactly you.

42:47.280 --> 42:51.239
You’ve got a real problem about
women in racing. What is it?

42:51.360 --> 42:54.719
We drive too slow... or too fast?

42:54.840 --> 42:57.919
I didn’t mean that.
It’s not you, it’s your car.

42:59.120 --> 43:02.000
- And my car.
- I don’t wanna hear about your car

43:02.120 --> 43:05.879
I have to tell you this.
I know it’s hard to believe but...

43:06.000 --> 43:09.479
You see,
Herbie’s not just a car. He...

43:09.600 --> 43:14.679
I didn’t believe it myself at first.
The little guy’s actually got a...

43:17.320 --> 43:20.360
When a car like Herbie
comes to Paris,

43:20.479 --> 43:25.439
he meets a beautiful Lancia
that’s also like Herbie is, with a...

43:28.879 --> 43:31.600
It’s natural
that they’re gonna fall in...

43:34.120 --> 43:38.520
You’re right.
I wouldn’t believe it either.

43:38.639 --> 43:43.959
When the men come by
from the booby hatch, go quietly.

43:46.879 --> 43:49.399
Just trying to warn you
about your car.

43:49.520 --> 43:51.879
Let me warn you about me!

43:52.000 --> 43:53.879
I’m in this race to win,

43:54.000 --> 43:59.560
and frankly, I’d like to see you
and your car disappear entirely!

44:24.360 --> 44:25.959
Quincy.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.159
Pull over! We want that car!

44:32.639 --> 44:36.959
- What you gonna do?
- I’m gonna pull over.

44:53.159 --> 44:54.360
Hang on!

45:21.800 --> 45:25.439
Darkness is about to fall upon you.

45:28.600 --> 45:30.479
Amazing!

45:58.800 --> 46:02.919
- They’re still coming!
- I think they are trying to kill us!

46:31.040 --> 46:34.280
I never thought she’d go that far
to make us disappear!

46:34.399 --> 46:37.959
- Who’s that?
- That cute little time bomb, Diane!

46:38.080 --> 46:41.040
She set us up to knock us out
of the race, like she said!

46:41.159 --> 46:43.320
Wait! She didn’t say that.

46:43.439 --> 46:45.719
Exactly.
They never say what they mean!

46:45.840 --> 46:49.719
That’s what makes the female of
the species deadlier than the male!

46:49.840 --> 46:51.800
You read that someplace.

46:51.919 --> 46:55.760
Yes, and I’ve got a mother, three
sisters and two ex-wives to prove it!

46:55.879 --> 46:57.919
They never said they wanted me out.

46:58.040 --> 47:00.639
But when I got home
the lock was changed!

47:00.760 --> 47:04.199
I don’t take strong arm stuff
from anybody. Male or female!

47:04.320 --> 47:07.000
Then somebody better teach
this female the rules of the game!

47:07.120 --> 47:11.320
If she doesn’t know them now, she
will when I’m through with her!

47:12.760 --> 47:14.760
You might as well settle back,
Herbie.

47:14.879 --> 47:17.520
Once Jim gets started,
nothing can stop him.

47:17.639 --> 47:21.439
Who hired thugs? I’m just as good
as anybody on that track.

47:21.560 --> 47:24.239
I don’t need anybody
to win my races for me!

47:24.360 --> 47:27.320
That is the trouble with all of you!

47:27.439 --> 47:30.080
You don’t think a woman
can do anything!

47:31.399 --> 47:34.000
Yeah, I know he seems like
a quiet sort of guy.

47:34.120 --> 47:38.399
But when a fight is inevitable,
he never ducks.

47:38.520 --> 47:45.439
Women are supposed to be nurses
and secretaries and schoolteachers!

47:45.560 --> 47:50.040
I’ve taken it all my life!
I took it from my mother and father!

47:50.159 --> 47:55.600
And my aunts and my uncles!
But I will not take it from you!

47:58.080 --> 48:01.280
When old Jim gets started,
I’d hate to get in his way!

48:01.399 --> 48:03.719
He’s a regular steamroller!

48:03.840 --> 48:08.800
Coward! I’m a race driver,
and I can win it on my own.

48:13.560 --> 48:16.320
You know, I think you can!

48:16.879 --> 48:18.479
Double-X?

48:18.600 --> 48:24.080
I... I’m afraid we’ve...
we’ve had another complication.

48:24.199 --> 48:27.639
{y:i}I’m beginning to think
{y:i}you are the complication!

48:27.760 --> 48:34.399
That... That item should have been
in my hands by now!

48:34.520 --> 48:37.000
{y:i}Don ‘t worry, sir.
{y:i}It’s still in the gas tank.

48:37.120 --> 48:40.080
Then bring me the tank!
What are you waiting for?

48:40.199 --> 48:43.479
We’ve lost them, sir!
We don’t know where they are!

48:43.600 --> 48:46.840
Excuse me,
I’m looking for Inspector Bouchet?

48:47.280 --> 48:48.679
Impossible.

48:48.800 --> 48:52.800
Are you trying to tell me a couple
of simple-minded Americans...

48:55.560 --> 48:57.600
...have disappeared?

48:57.719 --> 48:59.239
Hold on.

48:59.360 --> 49:01.320
Hope we’re not disturbing you.

49:01.439 --> 49:06.360
No! Your timing
could not be more perfect!

49:06.479 --> 49:09.520
I want to thank you
for your continued co-operation

49:09.639 --> 49:12.239
in the matter of the stolen diamond.

49:12.360 --> 49:15.879
- Well, tonight we need your help.
- Somebody’s after our car!

49:16.000 --> 49:18.320
That seems impossible.

49:18.439 --> 49:21.679
I think they’re trying
to knock us out of the race!

49:21.800 --> 49:24.239
I was wondering if there’s some way,
I dunno,

49:24.360 --> 49:26.879
we can put the car
in protective custody for tonight!

49:27.000 --> 49:29.520
If you’re not too busy
trying to find that diamond.

49:29.639 --> 49:33.239
No! One is just as important
as the other, I assure you.

49:33.360 --> 49:34.919
A moment.

49:42.320 --> 49:45.959
Oh! I mean,...

49:46.479 --> 49:50.040
- We’ll wait in the car.
- Good idea.

49:50.159 --> 49:53.479
We wouldn’t want anything
to happen to it. Not now.

49:56.159 --> 49:59.840
Hello? The car is here!

49:59.959 --> 50:01.639
Never mind how!

50:01.760 --> 50:04.120
Never mind how!

50:04.239 --> 50:05.959
No, it’s too risky for me.

50:06.080 --> 50:11.280
I will see the car is at
32, Avenue Mozart, within the hour.

50:11.399 --> 50:13.199
Don’t get lost on the way!

50:24.399 --> 50:28.479
Your worry is now my worry,
gentlemen. Rest easily.

50:28.600 --> 50:31.879
I’ll take personal charge
of this valuable possession.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.320
- Inspector!
- Yes, Fontenoy?

50:34.439 --> 50:37.719
Off duty or not, sir,
I couldn’t sleep

50:37.840 --> 50:40.520
thinking how the diamond
must weigh on your mind.

50:40.639 --> 50:44.320
At the moment,
I have a car weighing on my mind.

50:44.439 --> 50:47.040
Someone wants to put us
out of the race.

50:47.159 --> 50:51.080
With your time in the trials, it
does not take a master of deduction

50:51.199 --> 50:53.719
like Inspector Bouchet
to see you could win!

50:53.840 --> 50:59.800
Which is why I personally will ensure
the safety of this automobile.

50:59.919 --> 51:03.399
Put your mind at ease, gentlemen.
Get a good night’s sleep.

51:03.520 --> 51:06.479
Thank you. You too, Herbie!

51:06.600 --> 51:09.560
- Big day tomorrow, pal. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.919
No, permit me, sir!

51:12.040 --> 51:16.320
You have enough responsibility with
the diamond! I’ll look after the car!

51:16.439 --> 51:19.120
Don’t be ridiculous!

51:24.280 --> 51:27.280
- What are you doing?
- Anything for you, Inspector!

51:27.399 --> 51:29.080
Get out of that car.

51:32.320 --> 51:37.679
Leave it to me, sir! I’ll keep this
car hidden so no-one will find it!

51:46.120 --> 51:48.000
Fontenoy!

51:49.199 --> 51:51.560
My best man.

51:59.719 --> 52:02.239
- Night.
- Night.

52:04.199 --> 52:06.159
My very best!

52:08.719 --> 52:11.879
We’ve checked that, sir.
It’s nowhere.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.320
We’ve covered the whole city!
Now what?

52:15.439 --> 52:18.439
In the morning, before the race,

52:18.560 --> 52:22.040
that ridiculous little car
will get gasoline.

52:22.159 --> 52:25.239
When it does, you’ll be there!

52:26.040 --> 52:30.760
Welcome, everyone, to the inaugural
running of the Trans-France Race!

52:30.879 --> 52:34.600
They are all here, qualifying drivers
and cars from the world over.

52:34.719 --> 52:39.679
Each looking forward expectantly...

52:40.719 --> 52:45.479
...one of the most punishing races
ever, and these drivers know it.

52:45.600 --> 52:49.320
They have no doubt gone through
these cars time after time,

52:49.439 --> 52:53.360
and yet they’re still refining
and tuning each car.

52:53.479 --> 52:59.239
Each preparing for the gruelling race
that will test man and machine.

52:59.360 --> 53:01.679
I just wish I had a machine to test!

53:01.800 --> 53:06.199
I hope what’s-his-name didn’t hide
Herbie so well he can’t find him.

53:06.320 --> 53:11.800
I wish you hadn’t said that.
I’m a mechanic. I need a car!

53:11.919 --> 53:16.040
There’s a million details
have to be taken care of for a race!

53:16.159 --> 53:19.719
And you know I pride myself
on being thorough.

53:20.239 --> 53:21.800
My tools! Where’s my tools!

53:25.199 --> 53:26.760
Right here.

53:27.800 --> 53:29.479
I knew that!

53:35.000 --> 53:38.040
Inspector, the race is about to
begin! Where’s our car!

53:38.159 --> 53:40.320
Believe me,
I am as concerned as you are!

53:40.439 --> 53:45.719
But I’m sure Fontenoy will be here.
He’s unpredictable, but dependable.

53:45.840 --> 53:47.120
What?

53:48.280 --> 53:50.840
Let me check with headquarters
again!

53:56.919 --> 53:58.840
It will be here!

53:58.959 --> 54:01.439
You be ready!

54:03.199 --> 54:05.479
Who’s that?

54:05.600 --> 54:08.080
That’s Double-X, you dummy!

54:09.159 --> 54:12.639
Better duck, here comes trouble!

54:13.280 --> 54:14.840
Hello.

54:16.159 --> 54:17.520
Hello.

54:20.080 --> 54:25.159
- Look, about last night...
- I know. Me too. Sorry.

54:25.280 --> 54:28.239
Not about missing me with that vase,
I hope?

54:29.080 --> 54:33.919
No. I guess I was a little uptight
last night. Nervous about the race.

54:34.959 --> 54:39.399
Yeah. Well, I threw a few brickbats
myself. In the wrong direction.

54:39.520 --> 54:43.280
We didn’t get off to a flying start,
did we?

54:43.399 --> 54:47.280
Herbie and I
take a little getting used to.

54:48.639 --> 54:54.239
When you keep including Herbie
you take a lot of getting used to.

54:58.320 --> 55:01.199
By the way, where is... it?

55:01.320 --> 55:02.879
- Well, I...
- Douglas.

55:03.800 --> 55:06.639
Did you misplace your little car?

55:07.199 --> 55:08.879
Just temporarily.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.520
You should look under a rock,
you might find it.

55:11.639 --> 55:16.120
No, not under a rock, Gilbert,
under a gravestone.

55:16.239 --> 55:21.120
{y:i}Attention, everyone! All drivers
{y:i}bring your machines to the grid!

55:21.239 --> 55:23.639
{y:i}Five minutes to race time!

55:24.719 --> 55:26.280
It’s just as well, Douglas.

55:26.399 --> 55:30.639
You know the saying.
They never come back.

55:36.919 --> 55:38.520
Well, I’d better go.

55:38.639 --> 55:41.159
Diane!

55:41.280 --> 55:43.199
Good luck.

55:44.600 --> 55:46.760
I think you mean that.

55:47.399 --> 55:52.639
{y:i}Drivers will please take your
{y:i}positions as quickly as possible!

56:49.840 --> 56:51.520
Take the brake off!

56:51.639 --> 56:53.760
The brake is off!

56:54.439 --> 56:58.120
You know something?
That Lancia’s waiting on Herbie.

56:58.239 --> 57:02.040
Yeah? Well, so are we!
All we need is her hanging around!

57:07.040 --> 57:07.879
Listen...

57:08.000 --> 57:10.719
I hope you had nothing to do with
this!

57:10.840 --> 57:14.120
- I didn’t but I think I know who did.
- I know, your Herbie!

57:14.239 --> 57:17.879
Yes, Herbie’s missing,
and your Lancia’s missing him!

57:18.000 --> 57:22.320
You must think I’m a fool
with this Herbie, Herbie, Herbie!

57:22.439 --> 57:25.560
Well, I don’t believe in fairy tales
or Herbie or you!

57:25.679 --> 57:27.439
Jim?

57:27.560 --> 57:29.600
Pop the hood, will you?

57:33.120 --> 57:36.439
- What are you doing?
- You want your car started?

57:41.159 --> 57:43.959
Listen... I know how you feel.

57:44.080 --> 57:46.879
But you better get over it
right now.

57:47.000 --> 57:50.520
Forget Herbie.
You know why he isn’t here?

57:50.639 --> 57:52.760
He’s found somebody else, that’s why.

57:52.879 --> 57:56.520
And he didn’t have the guts to tell
you, so I’m telling you.

57:56.639 --> 58:00.080
Oh, yeah. We’re talking
about the same guy, alright.

58:00.199 --> 58:05.439
Old Herbie.
Old fun-loving, fickle Herbie.

58:08.320 --> 58:13.320
- Now you see him, now you don’t.
- He’s right, you know.

58:13.439 --> 58:17.919
So far we’ve had to tell a Fiat,
a Thunderbird and an Austin Healey.

58:18.040 --> 58:22.040
I know how you feel.
It’s... fun while it lasted.

58:22.159 --> 58:27.719
But the truth is, you weren’t the
first and you won’t be the last.

58:29.879 --> 58:32.919
You might as well take off.

58:34.679 --> 58:39.320
Will somebody help me start my car?

58:41.760 --> 58:44.280
Let me have a look.

58:46.439 --> 58:48.760
- Thank you!
- No problem!

58:48.879 --> 58:52.639
I was beginning to think
everyone was crazy!

58:59.479 --> 59:02.199
Well, so much for the Lancia!

59:02.320 --> 59:05.399
Yes. So much for both of ‘em,
I guess.

59:15.439 --> 59:18.479
Douglas! Let’s go! Don’t you realise
you’ve got pole position!

59:18.600 --> 59:22.159
- I also realise we don’t have a car!
- But It’ll be here!

59:22.280 --> 59:26.520
It had better be, in two minutes,
or you can try again next year!

59:36.840 --> 59:38.560
{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen!

59:38.679 --> 59:45.080
{y:i}The first inaugural running of the
{y:i}Trans-France Race is about to begin!

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.320
What’s that?

01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:53.840
It’s an armoured truck.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.959
That armoured truck is us!

01:00:58.439 --> 01:00:59.560
Excuse me!

01:00:59.679 --> 01:01:01.320
Yes, yes!

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.560
Where’s Herbie? Are you crazy?

01:01:15.679 --> 01:01:20.959
We’re supposed to be in a race
and you’re guarding the crown jewels!

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:23.199
We didn’t travel 6,000 miles

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:27.040
to see some French pastry
dressed up like a tin soldier.

01:01:27.159 --> 01:01:30.360
I’ve had it with the French!
The men, the women and...

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.600
Herbie?

01:01:40.159 --> 01:01:41.280
Are we still in it?

01:01:41.399 --> 01:01:44.320
You could be starting and finishing
in last in place!

01:01:44.439 --> 01:01:47.159
No time to lose.
You have things to attend to!

01:01:48.959 --> 01:01:52.040
- Gas! Move it, Wheely!
- Check. Top of my list!

01:02:02.879 --> 01:02:05.000
Fill it up!

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.840
Monsieur Douglas, stop!

01:02:06.959 --> 01:02:08.760
What? What do you mean, stop?

01:02:08.879 --> 01:02:11.719
The tank is full.
I filled it this morning.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.760
Let’s go! Wheely

01:02:22.719 --> 01:02:24.959
Come on, Herbie,
the race is back there!

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:29.560
I know. He can’t fool me,
he’s looking for that Lancia!

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:35.520
Inspector! What I was going to say, sir.

01:02:35.639 --> 01:02:39.399
Suppose there’s a link between
the men who attacked the car

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.959
- and the men who stole the diamond!
- Not now!

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:45.040
What if they have hidden
the stolen diamond in the car?

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.159
- What?
- If I may suggest...

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.879
we should have our men
search that car immediately.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.360
- There is no time!
- But it’s still here!

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:07.439
Yes... but it is obviously
tuning up. Or something.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:14.320
Just say the word, and the men and I
will search it bumper to bumper!

01:03:14.439 --> 01:03:16.639
The word is no, Fontenoy!

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.159
No?

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:26.760
What you don’t seem to understand
is that a thorough search

01:03:26.879 --> 01:03:28.840
would take over an hour.

01:03:28.959 --> 01:03:32.600
An hour’s delay would deprive
Douglas of winning a race

01:03:32.719 --> 01:03:36.360
he has travelled
half way round the globe to enter.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:38.919
Sir?

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.840
I admire you for your consideration.

01:03:41.959 --> 01:03:45.879
And I understand now
exactly how you are thinking.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:50.399
Sorry, sir.

01:03:53.919 --> 01:03:56.560
Forget the Lancia,
Herbie, she’s gone!

01:03:56.679 --> 01:03:59.239
You heard him right. Gone. Split!

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.239
Yeah, that’s right.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.199
She took off in that race
like you never existed.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.679
She wanted me to tell you
it was fun while it lasted

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.959
but when push came to shove
she shoved off.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.239
That’s just the way women are.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:28.159
Might as well face it. You’ve been
deserted.Jilted. Abandoned!

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:25.320
Too late now. We’ll get it
in Monte Carlo. After the race.

01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:38.199
Inspector!
I think you will be proud of me!

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.679
What now, Fontenoy?

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:43.600
I have done exactly
what I know you would want.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:50.360
Notified Monte Carlo. Their police
will search the car when it arrives.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.639
I’ll take care of my truck, sir.

01:08:41.839 --> 01:08:43.080
Catch anything?

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.560
I didn’t think so.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:50.479
- Which way?
- Right.

01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:58.000
Left!

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:19.799
Hope they get that trophy to Monaco
in a fast jet, or we’ll beat it.

01:11:19.919 --> 01:11:22.839
Unfortunately someone
put the Alps in our way.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.439
The way Herbie’s flying, nothing
could stop him, even the Himalayas!

01:13:25.399 --> 01:13:29.120
This road’s not even on the map!
Maybe we should ask directions?

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:32.520
- From who, a French mountain goat?
- Must be somebody.

01:13:53.799 --> 01:13:56.600
- Maybe I’ll just call from in here!
- Yeah!

01:14:09.439 --> 01:14:12.200
Hey. There’s someone out there!

01:14:14.759 --> 01:14:18.080
No. That’s just me!
I never heard a real echo before!

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.520
Will you sit down, Wheely!

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:26.160
Just one more, OK?

01:14:32.359 --> 01:14:33.919
Come on, Wheely!

01:15:02.359 --> 01:15:04.439
I got somebody.

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:10.560
The guys who were after Herbie!

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.839
Get out of the car!

01:15:29.399 --> 01:15:32.279
I’m taking over! I’ll drive!

01:15:38.479 --> 01:15:41.040
If it worked once,
maybe it’ll work again!

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.959
I like your yo-de-lay-hoo!

01:16:39.319 --> 01:16:41.839
Well, we’re back on the beam.

01:16:41.959 --> 01:16:44.560
How many cars you figure
ahead of us?

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:47.720
Would you believe, all of them?

01:16:49.399 --> 01:16:51.359
Is that a knocking I hear
in the gas tank?

01:16:52.919 --> 01:16:55.319
Not in my gas tank! Never!

01:16:55.439 --> 01:16:59.040
Sound like something
clonking around in there!

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.279
We either listen to the driver
and stop to take the gas tank apart

01:17:04.399 --> 01:17:07.640
or we listen to the mechanic
and try to win!

01:17:07.759 --> 01:17:11.839
I’m listen to the mechanic!
Let’s go, Herbie!

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:16.919
What’s wrong?

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:20.200
I don’t know. Oil pressure’s up,
there’s plenty of gas...

01:18:20.319 --> 01:18:22.720
But he’s not getting it.

01:18:38.759 --> 01:18:41.319
I hate to mention this again, but...

01:18:41.439 --> 01:18:44.120
That nonsense
about the gas tank again?

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:48.080
Alright, let’s get it straight
who the mechanic is here!

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:52.319
You say it’s the gas tank,
and I say it isn’t!

01:18:52.439 --> 01:18:54.720
You see... It isn’t the gas tank.

01:18:54.839 --> 01:18:59.759
It’s this rock
that was in the gas tank...

01:18:59.879 --> 01:19:02.600
Hold it!

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:05.799
There’s only one kind of rock
that glistens like that!

01:19:05.919 --> 01:19:09.879
Sure, quartz. There’s millions
of them in any quarry in Philly.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:15.640
But not one
that’s worth six million bucks!

01:19:15.759 --> 01:19:16.879
Huh?

01:19:17.959 --> 01:19:19.279
{y:i}L‘Etoile de Joie!

01:19:19.399 --> 01:19:21.479
The tall "de" what?

01:19:21.959 --> 01:19:23.520
{y:i}L‘Etoile de Joie!

01:19:26.839 --> 01:19:31.959
That’s the biggest hunk
of diamond I ever saw in my life!

01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:35.120
What I don’t understand is how it...

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:38.720
- The black sedan!
- Huh? Where?

01:19:38.839 --> 01:19:41.759
No, no. They’re the ones
that robbed the museum!

01:19:41.879 --> 01:19:45.680
They weren’t trying to knock us out,
they wanted this out of Herbie!

01:19:45.799 --> 01:19:48.680
Thank you for helping us.
Up with your hands.

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:53.160
You gave us the slip
for the last time!

01:19:53.279 --> 01:19:55.600
We’ll take the rock.

01:19:55.720 --> 01:20:00.600
I don’t suppose you’d believe
that was just a hunk of quartz.

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:02.839
The rock. Let me have it.

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:45.479
The rock!
Well, come on, hand it over!

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:12.319
Well, what do we do with them now?

01:21:18.879 --> 01:21:21.720
Thanks, Herbie. We tie ‘em up.

01:21:45.759 --> 01:21:51.680
Double-X,... we lost them! First time
we’ve ever been done in by a car!

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:56.399
{y:i}The goods will be in Monte Carlo
{y:i}in a couple of hours.

01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:58.040
{y:i}No chance of stopping them.

01:21:58.839 --> 01:22:02.279
See, we’re rather tied up
at the moment.

01:22:07.319 --> 01:22:08.759
Get me the airport.

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.680
We passed every car on the road!

01:22:52.799 --> 01:22:56.160
- All except the Lancia.
- After the way she jilted Herbie,

01:22:56.279 --> 01:23:00.479
that’s one car he won’t want to come
second to! Right Herbie?

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:02.879
Hey, isn’t that it?

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:08.959
- Sure is.
- Maybe we should have stopped.

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:10.839
Stopped. Are you kidding?

01:23:10.959 --> 01:23:14.640
Throw away a hundred grand and
the biggest comeback of our lives?

01:23:14.759 --> 01:23:18.479
- We’ve got this. We’re a shoo-in!
- She’s in trouble.

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:21.600
Cars get in trouble.
Let the rescue boys bail her out!

01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:24.879
Yeah,
but she could be in real danger!

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.919
I’m sorry, Wheely. Sometimes
a comeback comes second.

01:23:35.799 --> 01:23:38.319
Herbie doesn’t seem to think so!

01:23:40.319 --> 01:23:44.680
Why should Herbie stop after
the lies you told him back there?

01:23:54.359 --> 01:23:57.120
The jilted lover!

01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:01.040
Why, if he knew that Lancia had
waited for him at the starting line,

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:05.919
wouldn’t even budge until you lied
to her about him throwing her over!

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:08.839
I mean, she... Why, he...

01:24:08.959 --> 01:24:11.319
I mean,
he’d be back at her side right now!

01:24:16.319 --> 01:24:19.399
I hate to say this,Jim,
but you got a big mouth!

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:28.759
Hang on, Diane!

01:24:46.799 --> 01:24:48.200
Thank you!

01:24:54.799 --> 01:24:56.600
Thank you!

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:58.040
- Thank you!
- You OK?

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:00.479
I... I think so.

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:02.959
I missed a shift and lost control.

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:06.479
That’s not all you coulda lost!

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:10.720
Herbie, what are you doing?
Herbie, there’s no time!

01:25:10.839 --> 01:25:15.680
Forget it, Wheely. He’s gonna
get his girlfriend out of the mud.

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:21.439
And us out of the race.

01:25:22.319 --> 01:25:25.279
I see it, but I don’t believe it!

01:25:35.399 --> 01:25:38.600
Well, you can believe this.
We are now out of the money!

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:41.600
Because sometimes
a comeback comes second?

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:45.080
Who’s given up, buddy? Not me!
You come with us!

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:48.439
No, no, I’m gonna stay with my car.

01:25:49.919 --> 01:25:52.439
Looks like we’re all gonna
stay with her car.

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:05.120
Let’s go, Wheely!

01:26:10.919 --> 01:26:13.680
You’re not going anyplace, are you?

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:31.000
Now listen to me.

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:34.439
Herbie, I know just how you feel.

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:37.399
But I also know
you’re not a quitter!

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:41.399
Now show ‘em you can do it, Herbie!

01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:42.959
Win it for them!

01:26:45.879 --> 01:26:46.839
And for her.

01:26:50.879 --> 01:26:53.359
The rest is up to you! Good luck!

01:26:53.479 --> 01:26:54.959
Thanks.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.560
Oh, come on, Herbie!
Open up, will ya? Come on!

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:04.680
I know you’re sore
about what I said, but I’m sorry!

01:27:05.919 --> 01:27:07.640
Look, I did it for you!

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:11.959
OK, OK, I did it for us!

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.479
Do you want me
to get down on my knees?

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:21.359
OK! Alright,
I lied to you and I’m sorry,

01:27:21.479 --> 01:27:25.080
and I promise I’ll never,
ever do it again, OK?

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.399
Boy, you sure don’t forgive easy!

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.200
Bouchet! Did you miss the turn
on your way to the Eiffel Tower?

01:27:48.399 --> 01:27:51.200
No, a little unfinished business,
Emile.

01:27:51.319 --> 01:27:55.640
You have wounded me. You think I
cannot handle a diamond search?

01:27:55.759 --> 01:27:58.759
Five of my best men are waiting
for the cars to arrive.

01:27:58.879 --> 01:28:00.959
That is exactly why I am here.

01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:03.439
Afraid I will steal
some of your glory?

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:08.359
There is no glory to be stolen.
I wish to rectify a terrible mistake.

01:28:08.479 --> 01:28:11.000
And save everyone
from embarrassment.

01:28:13.319 --> 01:28:14.600
The search is off!

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:15.879
Off?

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.959
The message was an error.

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:22.279
An overzealous young detective,
anxious to make a reputation.

01:28:23.479 --> 01:28:27.160
For this kind of news,
they invented the telephone!

01:28:27.279 --> 01:28:30.560
This is a matter that needed
my personal attention.

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:35.839
Who knows what complications
could arise from such a situation?

01:28:36.879 --> 01:28:42.759
This is a big race. It could cause...
an international incident!

01:28:52.919 --> 01:28:58.319
It seems your young man in Paris
has caused you a lot of trouble.

01:28:58.439 --> 01:29:02.959
I assure you, Emile,
I intend to put an end to it.

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:07.399
Wiser heads are always needed to
clean up the mistakes of the young.

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.600
It is true.

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:12.839
And our reward?
We get it when we reach heaven.

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:16.959
Perhaps a bit sooner.

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:32.040
Three down and two to go!

01:31:34.759 --> 01:31:37.799
Dirty road-hog!
He should learn how to drive!

01:31:37.919 --> 01:31:39.680
He knows! That’s the trouble.

01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:49.959
Yeah, I see what you mean!

01:32:25.399 --> 01:32:28.040
If we don’t get him by the tunnel...

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.959
There’s no way we can pass him!

01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:45.040
Bruno was right.
They never come back.

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:51.040
Herbie!

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:15.959
Ha ha! I don’t believe it!

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:27.600
- We did it!
- Never come back, huh?

01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:29.680
I guess Herbie wasn’t listening!

01:33:49.919 --> 01:33:53.799
How does it feel to be back
in the winner’s circle, pretty good?

01:33:53.919 --> 01:33:58.520
For the 20th time, a great race
and we enjoyed every minute of it.

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:00.240
Almost every minute!

01:34:00.359 --> 01:34:05.200
I’m enjoying every minute of this!

01:34:05.319 --> 01:34:09.680
And both of us would like
to thank you all very, very much!

01:34:24.879 --> 01:34:26.919
Right. See you around, Douglas.

01:34:35.879 --> 01:34:39.240
That’s a cute little memento
you got there, old buddy.

01:34:39.359 --> 01:34:43.839
It’s as much yours as mine,
and more Herbie’s than anybody’s!

01:34:43.959 --> 01:34:45.200
You can say that again.

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.000
Well, look who’s here!

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:51.560
May I add my congratulations?

01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:54.799
You’ll congratulate us more
when you see what we have!

01:34:54.919 --> 01:34:56.640
Yeah, in Herbie’s tank!

01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:01.479
- This what you’ve been looking for?
- Yes!

01:35:02.919 --> 01:35:06.959
It’s had a rough trip. But it’s
winding up in the right hands.

01:35:07.919 --> 01:35:09.839
Indeed it is.

01:35:09.959 --> 01:35:13.120
Don’t know how we missed
connections, sir. But here I am!

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:14.680
Fontenoy!

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:19.600
You see, I knew the diamond
would be found!

01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:23.200
It’s an honour to be at your side
in this moment of triumph!

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:29.640
And I have more good news, sir!
The two thieves have been captured!

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:33.120
Ah! Good!

01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:36.560
Good. Then I’d say
the case is concluded.

01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:42.000
Yeah... But it seems there’d be a
mastermind behind this kind of thing.

01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:45.520
Or that museum
had some pretty lousy security.

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:48.759
Sir! Men have fought duels
for such an accusation!

01:35:48.879 --> 01:35:51.839
The museum security
was virtually foolproof.

01:35:51.959 --> 01:35:55.160
I made an interesting discovery
today, sir!

01:35:55.279 --> 01:35:58.839
From the sensitised floor to
the radar beam around the pedestal,

01:35:58.959 --> 01:36:01.279
to the pillow
on which the diamond rested,

01:36:01.399 --> 01:36:04.479
all the traps were conceived
and executed by one man!

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:07.279
- Fontenoy.
- No, sir. Credit where it is due.

01:36:07.399 --> 01:36:12.720
The combinations of the security
system were known only to you, sir!

01:36:12.839 --> 01:36:15.319
The only question is,

01:36:15.439 --> 01:36:19.000
who beside the inspector
knew the details of the precautions?

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:24.680
Who beside the inspector?

01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:30.959
The answer to that question is...

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:33.359
..nobody!

01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:37.439
My retirement
has been delayed too long!

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:40.680
I hope no-one will be foolish enough
to move!

01:36:42.759 --> 01:36:45.959
Move this ridiculous car,
or I’ll kill...

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:55.359
Even a mastermind can be outsmarted
by this car! Thanks, Herbie.

01:37:00.359 --> 01:37:01.520
Inspector?

01:37:13.359 --> 01:37:17.399
I always hoped you’d be present
when I cracked my first big case!

01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:20.839
Fontenoy!

01:37:20.959 --> 01:37:23.240
Excuse me, sir.

01:37:23.359 --> 01:37:26.720
Sorry, sir. Sorry...

01:37:26.839 --> 01:37:30.319
I think you’ll find
it’s all here, monsieur.

01:37:30.439 --> 01:37:32.799
I’m so happy!

01:37:35.479 --> 01:37:39.399
I personally will see to it
this magnificent automobile

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:42.399
receives the greatest honour
France can bestow!

01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:07.000
"S’il-vous plait," the VW?

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:08.959
The VW?

01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:13.319
Yes, the VW... The white one
with a 53 on the side.

01:38:13.439 --> 01:38:15.040
Yes, I know the car.

01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:18.319
It is the toast of all Monte Carlo!

01:38:18.439 --> 01:38:20.839
It’s also our transportation,
if you don’t mind...

01:38:20.959 --> 01:38:25.200
I don’t mind, monsieur,
but... it is no longer here.

01:38:25.319 --> 01:38:28.000
What?

01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:30.560
It was stolen!

01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:34.279
Mademoiselle,
you would not believe this.

01:38:34.399 --> 01:38:36.680
I would not believe this!

01:38:36.799 --> 01:38:38.680
No-one would believe this!

01:38:38.799 --> 01:38:43.439
It was stolen by another car.

01:38:47.959 --> 01:38:50.560
Now look, I know
that you believe about Herbie,

01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:52.240
but you’re probably...

01:38:52.359 --> 01:38:55.640
Giselle can do anything
she wants to.

01:38:55.759 --> 01:38:57.399
Giselle?

01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:01.640
We’re strong women, she and I.
Shall we make it a foursome?

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:05.640
Let’s go!

01:39:10.959 --> 01:39:15.040
Take us to
the most romantic spot in Monaco!

01:39:40.279 --> 01:39:41.640
Well,...

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:48.640
Yeah, being chief mechanic
is important,

01:39:48.759 --> 01:39:52.919
but I didn’t exactly
win the race all by myself.

01:39:53.959 --> 01:39:55.839
No?

01:39:55.959 --> 01:39:57.839
Well, almost.
