00:12.730 --> 00:15.131
What the hell?

00:21.205 --> 00:24.274
Hey. Hey. Hey!

00:28.412 --> 00:29.813
No, no! No! No!

00:29.815 --> 00:30.780
Get him out!

00:30.782 --> 00:32.314
Get out of the truck!

00:34.653 --> 00:37.153
Let me go. Let me go.

00:39.757 --> 00:41.257
Take the truck.

00:41.259 --> 00:42.926
Take the wallet,
take the phone, okay?

00:42.928 --> 00:44.427
Just... I won't say a word.

00:44.429 --> 00:46.229
Damn right you won't say a word.

00:48.799 --> 00:51.000
'Cause I know
who you are

00:51.002 --> 00:53.303
and where you live.

00:53.305 --> 00:55.605
Okay, I swear. Take the truck.

00:55.607 --> 00:57.807
I won't say a damn thing
to nobody.

00:57.809 --> 01:00.276
I believe you.

01:11.088 --> 01:13.056
30 years old?

01:13.058 --> 01:14.891
That's what it says
on the label.

01:14.893 --> 01:17.126
30-year-old Rebel Tears.

01:17.128 --> 01:18.528
That stuff's impossible to get.

01:18.530 --> 01:20.163
I know a guy.

01:20.165 --> 01:21.764
How'd you afford it?
Me and 11 guys

01:21.766 --> 01:23.166
went in on a case.

01:23.168 --> 01:25.101
My guy got us a discount.

01:25.103 --> 01:26.169
Still.
- Hey,

01:26.171 --> 01:28.471
when opportunity knocks,
you answer.

01:28.473 --> 01:30.673
Enter.

01:33.210 --> 01:35.111
I can't just stand
by and not notice

01:35.113 --> 01:36.846
if you guys are
drinking in here.

01:36.848 --> 01:39.749
Nah, we're not drinking;
we're just admiring.

01:39.751 --> 01:42.986
30-year-old Rebel Tears.
Whatever that is.

01:42.988 --> 01:44.921
Liquid gold.
- I'm not crackin' it.

01:44.923 --> 01:45.989
Nope.

01:46.824 --> 01:48.825
So, I just got a phone call

01:48.827 --> 01:50.426
from my old sergeant.

01:50.428 --> 01:52.095
He made captain a few weeks ago,

01:52.097 --> 01:55.064
and they gave him
Group 1 at IAB.

01:55.066 --> 01:55.965
Captain Bullman.

01:55.967 --> 01:58.635
He asked me
to come work with him.

02:00.771 --> 02:03.539
In his group,
answering directly to him.

02:04.375 --> 02:06.409
Wow, that's great, Abby.

02:06.411 --> 02:07.677
Congratulations!

02:07.679 --> 02:09.679
It's staying sealed.
We all get it.

02:09.681 --> 02:11.714
You gonna take it?

02:11.716 --> 02:13.316
I don't know.

02:13.318 --> 02:15.285
I wanted to talk
to you guys first.

02:15.287 --> 02:19.022
Boss is gonna be, I don't know,
I can't even imagine.

02:19.024 --> 02:20.623
Well, that's a big part
of my hesitation.

02:20.625 --> 02:22.125
What do you think
I should do?

02:22.127 --> 02:24.294
Go back in time
and not tell us about it?

02:24.296 --> 02:27.096
I promise I will not tell him
that we spoke about this.

02:27.098 --> 02:28.298
Actually, you won't have to.

02:28.300 --> 02:30.099
He'll just know.
Not if you don't tell him.

02:30.101 --> 02:32.902
He'll just know in that way
that he just knows stuff.

02:36.640 --> 02:39.142
I have been with him
going on nine years.

02:39.144 --> 02:41.711
Great years, but I've gone
from being detective

02:41.713 --> 02:43.846
to Miss Moneypenny.
- Abby,

02:43.848 --> 02:45.515
he really values your smarts.

02:45.517 --> 02:46.950
Anybody could see that.

02:46.952 --> 02:50.153
I know. I just feel like a
small fish in a big pond.

02:50.155 --> 02:51.387
This is hard.

02:51.389 --> 02:53.122
I hear you.
It's one of those things

02:53.124 --> 02:54.757
that's "nothing personal"

02:54.759 --> 02:57.660
that gets taken
as "very personal."

02:57.662 --> 03:01.631
By a man I owe and admire
more than I can say.

03:06.870 --> 03:09.706
♪

03:24.055 --> 03:25.755
Are you okay?

03:25.757 --> 03:26.756
Help me.

03:26.758 --> 03:27.991
Are you all right?

03:27.993 --> 03:28.992
Help me, please!

03:28.994 --> 03:29.959
Are you all right?

03:29.961 --> 03:30.994
Come here.
He's trying to kill me!

03:30.996 --> 03:32.128
Okay, it's okay.

03:32.130 --> 03:34.163
- Where do you think you're going?!
- Let her go!

03:35.399 --> 03:38.301
Let her go!

03:39.571 --> 03:41.738
I got you.

03:44.109 --> 03:46.075
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

03:46.077 --> 03:47.477
It's okay. It's okay.

03:47.479 --> 03:48.778
I've got you, I've got you.

03:48.780 --> 03:50.613
You're gonna be okay, all right?

03:50.615 --> 03:52.315
Okay.

03:52.317 --> 03:54.417
Hey! Police! Police!

03:54.419 --> 03:56.486
Hey! What's going on?
- Hey!

03:56.488 --> 03:58.321
Hurry! Please hurry!

03:58.323 --> 04:00.323
You have to help the others!

04:00.325 --> 04:01.591
Others?

04:01.593 --> 04:03.459
There's a guy in there
trying to kill her!

04:03.461 --> 04:04.794
Stay put.

04:04.796 --> 04:05.796
Go.

04:06.563 --> 04:08.364
Police!

04:08.366 --> 04:10.500
Police.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.055
Door.

04:36.527 --> 04:37.894
You set?
- Go. Yes.

04:37.896 --> 04:40.163
Police! Don't move!

04:40.165 --> 04:41.597
Police! Don't move!

04:41.599 --> 04:43.900
You got it?
- Go, go.

04:46.638 --> 04:49.072
You're gonna be okay.

04:50.575 --> 04:52.308
Anybody else in here
with you guys?

04:52.310 --> 04:53.976
Just stay put. We're
gonna help you out.

04:53.978 --> 04:55.478
Eddie, I got two more.

04:55.480 --> 04:56.779
Call it in.

04:56.781 --> 04:59.148
Central, 12-David.
10-85 forthwith.

04:59.150 --> 05:01.184
I got multiple hostages
at this location.

05:01.186 --> 05:03.086
And we got
one under.

05:05.856 --> 05:09.856

05:32.320 --> 05:34.348
Was there anything
unusual about them?

05:34.360 --> 05:37.361
Accents? Were they short,
tall, black, white?

05:37.363 --> 05:39.296
You know the thing that really
gets me is they didn't have

05:39.298 --> 05:41.198
to do this, 'cause they
already had the truck.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.900
So they just did
it for giggles.

05:42.902 --> 05:44.835
Which is why we want
to make 'em pay for that.

05:44.837 --> 05:47.771
So, anything you can give us
to help will go a long way.

05:47.773 --> 05:49.306
I already told you what I know.

05:49.308 --> 05:51.175
Three guys in masks
took your truck.

05:51.177 --> 05:52.276
That's what happened.

05:52.278 --> 05:54.812
The best way
to protect yourself is

05:54.814 --> 05:56.714
to put these guys behind bars.

05:56.716 --> 05:59.283
Sorry. I didn't see a thing,
okay?

05:59.285 --> 06:01.118
Okay.

06:01.120 --> 06:05.355
Do you mind if we, uh,
take a look at your wallet?

06:11.229 --> 06:13.330
Your license is missing.

06:14.632 --> 06:17.434
Sorry. I lost it.

06:17.436 --> 06:19.069
They threatened you,
they took your license,

06:19.071 --> 06:20.370
and now they have your address,

06:20.372 --> 06:22.473
which is why
you're not gonna help us.

06:23.308 --> 06:26.643
I didn't see a thing.

06:30.815 --> 06:33.016
Can we go?

06:37.255 --> 06:39.256
<i>Is she gonna be okay?</i>

06:39.258 --> 06:42.626
Word from the hospital is she's
on her way to stable condition.

06:42.628 --> 06:44.094
And the two other girls
you found?

06:44.096 --> 06:46.330
Being treated
as we speak.

06:46.332 --> 06:48.398
How bad was it in there?

06:48.400 --> 06:52.436
Listen, the truth is it's gonna
be a long road to recovery,

06:52.438 --> 06:54.571
but tomorrow's gonna be
a lot better for them

06:54.573 --> 06:57.908
than yesterday, thanks to you.
No.

06:57.910 --> 06:59.943
I just... reacted.

06:59.945 --> 07:02.045
By stepping up.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.847
99 out of 100
would have turned away.

07:03.849 --> 07:05.549
Trust me, I'm no hero.

07:05.551 --> 07:07.151
If you knew me in real life,

07:07.153 --> 07:08.819
you'd know I'm
just a regular guy.

07:08.821 --> 07:12.790
Well, trust me, there is nothing
regular about you.

07:12.792 --> 07:15.259
Parker Mack--
is that your full name?

07:15.261 --> 07:16.393
Yeah, that's right.

07:16.395 --> 07:18.195
Did you ever live
in Pennsylvania?

07:18.197 --> 07:20.898
I went to college there.
Why? What's up?

07:20.900 --> 07:22.266
You ever involved

07:22.268 --> 07:24.635
in a grand larceny
auto situation down there?

07:25.470 --> 07:27.805
Oh, that.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.874
- Jamie?
- I can explain. That's...

07:30.876 --> 07:32.442
Jamie, wh-what's going on?

07:32.444 --> 07:35.245
I'm afraid you're under arrest.

07:37.549 --> 07:39.416
Your name popped
on an outstanding warrant

07:39.418 --> 07:41.585
in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

07:41.587 --> 07:43.420
Jamie, you can't be serious.

07:43.422 --> 07:45.222
This kid-- he's a hero.

07:45.224 --> 07:47.057
He's also a wanted felon.

07:47.059 --> 07:49.026
Let's go.

07:51.063 --> 07:52.029
Now.

07:52.031 --> 07:54.264
Come here. Hands
behind your back.

08:07.345 --> 08:09.847
<i>I don't blame him.</i>

08:09.849 --> 08:11.481
<i>Pack of animals like that</i>

08:11.483 --> 08:13.517
knows where I live,
I wouldn't be talking, either.

08:13.519 --> 08:17.187
So you'd just let them go and do
it to somebody else, too, right?

08:17.189 --> 08:20.624
Sorry. Priority number one
is protecting my family.

08:20.626 --> 08:23.760
That attitude is exactly what
those animals are counting on.

08:23.762 --> 08:27.264
It's why they even do this crap,
and they're gonna keep doing it

08:27.266 --> 08:29.132
until someone's brave
enough to stand up.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.168
Well, I don't know
what to tell you, Reagan.

08:31.170 --> 08:32.501
Not everyone has your cojones.

08:32.504 --> 08:35.005
Fair enough.

08:36.073 --> 08:37.975
What about the
Finest Message?

08:37.977 --> 08:39.743
What?

08:39.745 --> 08:41.645
Did the Finest Message
go out on the truck?

08:41.647 --> 08:43.947
- Probably.
- Well, we got to find out definitely.

08:43.948 --> 08:45.482
We need to find that truck.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.551
What, are you thinking someone
left behind some fingerprints?

08:47.553 --> 08:49.586
No. If they were smart
enough to wear masks,

08:49.588 --> 08:51.655
they're smart enough
to wear gloves.

08:51.657 --> 08:52.723
Well, so what then?

08:52.725 --> 08:55.325
That then, right there.

08:55.327 --> 08:57.828
The dash cam?
If I owned the fleet,

08:57.830 --> 08:59.429
I'd have one of those bad boys

08:59.431 --> 09:01.331
on board every vehicle
on the road.

09:02.233 --> 09:04.701
We got to find that truck.

09:04.703 --> 09:06.236
Straight after the lunch
with the archbishop,

09:06.238 --> 09:08.372
you're up to Washington Heights
to dedicate the new...

09:08.374 --> 09:10.274
We're gonna have
to push that a half hour.

09:10.276 --> 09:11.842
Oh, we can't.
The whole day is back to back.

09:11.844 --> 09:13.877
He never makes it out of lunch
with His Eminence on time.

09:13.879 --> 09:15.846
Can't you politely
remind the archbishop that...

09:15.848 --> 09:17.481
There's no way to do that,
especially seeing

09:17.483 --> 09:19.249
as the commissioner is also
a devout Catholic.

09:19.251 --> 09:20.550
She's right. Push.

09:20.552 --> 09:22.519
I'll take care of it now.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.391
After the dedication, you got...
Just a sec.

09:28.259 --> 09:29.626
Okay.

09:29.628 --> 09:33.063
You guys notice anything
about Abigail?

09:33.065 --> 09:34.531
No.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.601
No.

09:37.603 --> 09:39.703
Like what?

09:39.705 --> 09:42.205
Well, I know she gets allergies.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.741
Maybe
it's a high pollen count day.

09:44.743 --> 09:48.745
Something.

09:48.747 --> 09:50.647
Maybe you just ask her?

09:50.649 --> 09:52.316
I will,
but I'm asking you first.

09:52.318 --> 09:54.017
Any heads-up you can give me?

09:56.454 --> 09:58.355
Hello?

09:58.357 --> 09:59.790
What do you want to know?

09:59.792 --> 10:01.291
What it is I don't know.

10:03.962 --> 10:05.729
She has a job offer.

10:05.731 --> 10:08.365
Her old boss, Bullman--

10:08.367 --> 10:10.334
he's now a
captain at IAB,

10:10.336 --> 10:12.102
as you know.

10:12.104 --> 10:14.705
Oh.

10:14.707 --> 10:16.340
And he reached out to her?

10:16.342 --> 10:17.307
Yeah.
- Yes.

10:17.309 --> 10:19.743
And she's pretty torn up
about it.

10:19.745 --> 10:20.911
Well, I can imagine.

10:20.913 --> 10:22.512
You can?
- Yeah.

10:22.514 --> 10:24.915
I mean, for ten years,
she's been at that desk.

10:24.917 --> 10:28.251
Her rank isn't Gal Friday.
It's Detective Second Grade.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.553
There's got
to be frustration there.

10:29.555 --> 10:32.489
Well, that's almost exactly
the way she put it.

10:35.326 --> 10:37.060
Oh.

10:47.405 --> 10:50.440
So, they think it's gonna be
another day or two

10:50.442 --> 10:52.809
before they can transfer Parker
back to Pennsylvania.

10:52.811 --> 10:55.012
Yeah, paperwork on these
things can take a while.

10:55.014 --> 10:56.747
Yeah, so we got that
going for us.

10:56.749 --> 10:57.881
Got what going for us?

10:57.883 --> 10:59.516
Just hear me out.
- Oh, no.

10:59.518 --> 11:02.753
Jamie, this is crazy
and wrong and stupid.

11:02.755 --> 11:04.154
It's also black and white.

11:04.156 --> 11:06.323
He broke the law.
- Technically.

11:06.325 --> 11:08.258
Look, I'm not happy to see
it going this way, either,

11:08.260 --> 11:10.260
but the guy's wanted on
an outstanding warrant.

11:10.262 --> 11:11.628
You heard his side
of the story.

11:11.630 --> 11:14.264
His friends stole the car
and picked him up hours later.

11:14.266 --> 11:16.066
He had no idea
the car was stolen.

11:16.068 --> 11:17.634
Yes, that's his
side of the story.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.803
And you don't believe him.
Doesn't matter what I believe.

11:19.805 --> 11:22.005
He's got to fight a judge in
court just like everybody else.

11:22.007 --> 11:23.006
But you don't want to help?

11:23.008 --> 11:25.208
Help how?
- I don't know.

11:25.210 --> 11:28.211
But I know you, and I know
you can come up with something.

11:28.213 --> 11:30.847
I'm not some sort of criminal
justice magical genie.

11:30.849 --> 11:32.015
Just-just listen.

11:32.017 --> 11:34.518
Think about this
for two seconds.

11:34.520 --> 11:36.887
Imagine what life would be like
for those three women

11:36.889 --> 11:39.723
if not for what
that young man did.

11:39.725 --> 11:41.992
That's got to count
for something.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.629
I'm not making any promises.

11:45.631 --> 11:47.382
I knew I could count on you,
Jamison Reagan.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.801
Okay, let's go.

12:01.079 --> 12:02.746
Tell me you got
good news for us.

12:02.748 --> 12:04.314
See for yourself.

12:13.524 --> 12:16.359
Well, I was right.

12:16.361 --> 12:19.629
Truck was outfitted
with a dashboard cam.

12:19.631 --> 12:21.068
Then how come you ain't doing
your little happy dance?

12:21.092 --> 12:22.166
Because somebody else

12:22.167 --> 12:25.068
was expecting it to be outfitted
with a dashboard cam, too,

12:25.070 --> 12:26.503
and they smashed it to bits.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.921
Detective Reagan.

12:45.423 --> 12:47.224
Well, if it isn't

12:47.226 --> 12:49.459
The Artist Formerly Known
as TARU.

12:49.461 --> 12:51.395
You remember me.

12:51.397 --> 12:52.896
- Mm-hmm.
- You remember her.

12:52.898 --> 12:53.864
Yes, I do.

12:53.866 --> 12:55.432
I never forget a face.

12:55.434 --> 12:56.800
What do you got?

12:56.802 --> 12:58.602
It's for Detective Baez,
actually.

12:58.604 --> 13:01.705
Oh, well,
she's right over there.

13:01.707 --> 13:03.774
You, uh, asked us to take a
look at that dashboard cam.

13:03.776 --> 13:06.176
- But it was smashed to pieces.
- Figured it was worth a look anyway.

13:06.178 --> 13:08.211
And it was.

13:08.213 --> 13:09.713
Because it was
a digital recorder,

13:09.715 --> 13:11.915
I was able to salvage
one frame off the chip.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.583
You got the license plate.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.052
A partial, at least.

13:15.054 --> 13:16.019
We ran a lawman search,

13:16.021 --> 13:19.022
got three possible
registered owners.

13:19.891 --> 13:21.892
Well, what do you know?

13:21.894 --> 13:24.261
One of the names ring a bell?
Nicky Farina.

13:24.263 --> 13:25.996
Part of Victor Lugo's crew.

13:25.998 --> 13:29.700
Victor Lugo
as in "Defective Reagan"?

13:30.702 --> 13:32.936
"Defective Reagan"?

13:32.938 --> 13:33.937
Lugo's a mob capo

13:33.939 --> 13:36.039
with a pet name
for our Danny Boy here.

13:36.041 --> 13:37.941
Defective Reagan.

13:39.043 --> 13:40.510
That's a good one.

13:40.512 --> 13:42.045
Thanks.

13:47.285 --> 13:48.719
Hey.

13:48.721 --> 13:50.087
Hey. How you doing?

13:50.089 --> 13:51.688
Good. Sorry to bother you.
Not at all.

13:51.690 --> 13:52.856
Everything okay?

13:52.858 --> 13:54.124
It's my Good Samaritan.

13:54.126 --> 13:56.293
Oh, right, I heard about that.

13:56.295 --> 13:57.661
What a story.

13:57.663 --> 13:59.529
Pretty courageous thing to do.

13:59.531 --> 14:02.299
Yeah, it was. And he is.

14:03.001 --> 14:05.035
Is there a problem?

14:05.037 --> 14:06.970
When I took him back
to the station,

14:06.972 --> 14:08.505
his name popped
on a GLA warrant.

14:08.507 --> 14:10.841
No.
- Yeah, down in Pennsylvania.

14:10.843 --> 14:11.975
I spoke to him,

14:11.977 --> 14:13.844
and he says he didn't know
the car was stolen,

14:13.846 --> 14:16.513
and for what it's worth,
I believe him.

14:16.515 --> 14:19.149
It's not worth much. No offense,

14:19.151 --> 14:20.484
but he's wanted

14:20.486 --> 14:21.952
on an out-of-state felony.

14:21.954 --> 14:24.688
Pretty much out of moves.

14:25.523 --> 14:27.758
That's true, but...

14:27.760 --> 14:30.060
But what?
I know a lot of times

14:30.062 --> 14:31.862
the DA's Office
has forgotten about these.

14:31.864 --> 14:33.330
Maybe they don't even care
about it.

14:33.332 --> 14:35.432
Maybe.

14:35.434 --> 14:37.300
What if a certain someone

14:37.302 --> 14:40.270
spoke to the Bucks County DA's
Office and put in a good word?

14:40.272 --> 14:42.572
Okay. I'm sorry, Jamie,

14:42.574 --> 14:44.674
but as someone who sits
on this side of the desk,

14:44.676 --> 14:47.844
if some out-of-town cop
calls me with a sob story

14:47.846 --> 14:50.080
about some collar
he has a soft spot for,

14:50.082 --> 14:52.482
it's going in one ear
and right out the other.

14:52.484 --> 14:54.918
Probably right.

14:56.721 --> 14:59.256
But what if

14:59.258 --> 15:02.292
it's not coming from some cop
with a soft spot?

15:02.294 --> 15:03.493
What if it's coming from someone

15:03.495 --> 15:05.328
who sits on the same side
of the desk as him?

15:05.330 --> 15:07.164
You want me to do it?

15:07.166 --> 15:09.232
Thank you so much.

15:09.234 --> 15:11.001
- Oh, no, no, no, no. I didn't say yes.
- You are the best.

15:11.003 --> 15:13.970
No, Jamie, Jamie,
come Ba...

15:13.972 --> 15:17.107
I hate my brothers.

15:19.510 --> 15:20.744
Then just tell him his captain

15:20.746 --> 15:22.913
has a different last name now
and a different way

15:22.915 --> 15:25.215
of doing things. Copy?

15:25.217 --> 15:27.918
Get it done, please.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.686
As you were, please.

15:33.157 --> 15:35.492
Uh, I was just upstairs
with Chief Halleran,

15:35.494 --> 15:37.894
and I wanted to stop by
and congratulate you

15:37.896 --> 15:39.429
on your two bars.

15:40.298 --> 15:42.265
Thank you, sir.

15:42.267 --> 15:45.602
And I understand you've been
talking to Detective Baker

15:45.604 --> 15:47.571
about joining you here.

15:47.573 --> 15:49.773
Well, in a sense.

15:49.775 --> 15:51.508
In a sense?

15:51.510 --> 15:54.377
I was very clear with her
when she came to me.

15:56.247 --> 15:58.315
She came to you?

15:58.317 --> 16:00.450
And my first response
was no substantial talks

16:00.452 --> 16:02.519
unless and until
the commissioner

16:02.521 --> 16:04.287
had given his blessing.

16:04.289 --> 16:07.157
I appreciate that.

16:07.159 --> 16:09.159
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

16:09.161 --> 16:12.229
She is a valuable member
of my team.

16:12.231 --> 16:14.164
You'd be getting
the best of the best.

16:14.166 --> 16:16.099
And I would make the most
of that opportunity,

16:16.101 --> 16:17.534
I can tell you that.

16:19.337 --> 16:21.004
I'm sure you would.

16:21.006 --> 16:23.373
Anyway, congratulations.

16:24.408 --> 16:26.309
Overdue and well-deserved.

16:26.311 --> 16:27.944
Sir.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.579
She goes like this:

16:29.581 --> 16:32.549
one, two, three, four.

16:32.551 --> 16:34.351
Boom! That's how fast

16:34.353 --> 16:36.353
I just took this baby
from zero to 60.

16:36.355 --> 16:37.787
Left your ass on the line.

16:37.789 --> 16:39.489
Get out.
- No, you get out.

16:39.491 --> 16:40.857
This, gentlemen,

16:40.859 --> 16:43.693
is the world-famous DB11,

16:43.695 --> 16:45.762
brought to you by the legendary

16:45.764 --> 16:46.963
Aston Martin.

16:46.965 --> 16:49.166
Check out this interior.
You know what this is?

16:49.168 --> 16:50.300
You know what this is?

16:50.302 --> 16:53.236
This is genuine
Bridge of Weir leather hides

16:53.238 --> 16:54.437
from Scotland.

16:54.439 --> 16:55.805
Hand stitched

16:55.807 --> 16:57.741
with ten gauge thread.

16:57.743 --> 17:00.377
Smell that.

17:00.379 --> 17:02.612
Mmm! Nothing but class.

17:02.614 --> 17:04.614
You know what I think of
when I think of class?

17:04.616 --> 17:06.750
I think of you, Victor Lugo.

17:08.019 --> 17:09.553
Step back.

17:09.555 --> 17:11.755
Well, if it isn't his
Royal Defectiveness.

17:11.757 --> 17:13.323
Not for nothing, but you
might want to come up

17:13.325 --> 17:14.691
with some new material.

17:14.693 --> 17:16.526
Oh, fellas, the defective
wants some new material.

17:16.528 --> 17:18.295
All right,
how about this?

17:18.297 --> 17:20.964
What are the four
major food groups for a cop?

17:20.965 --> 17:25.502
Jelly, powder, frosted
and chocolate glazed.

17:27.138 --> 17:29.439
That's good.

17:29.441 --> 17:30.440
And this is one sweet ride.

17:30.442 --> 17:32.075
Little bit above
my price range,

17:32.077 --> 17:33.910
but very nice.
Hey, you start saving now,

17:33.912 --> 17:36.780
you could probably afford one
in, like, 900 years.

17:36.782 --> 17:38.114
But not to worry.

17:38.116 --> 17:40.016
Tony's got a line on
some used Hyundais

17:40.018 --> 17:41.184
you might be interested in.

17:41.186 --> 17:43.119
I'll be sure to
give Tony a call.

17:43.121 --> 17:45.755
But you know what's
even funnier, guys,

17:45.757 --> 17:47.891
is that this numbnuts
was dumb enough

17:47.893 --> 17:49.859
to go out and purchase
a vehicle like this

17:49.861 --> 17:52.829
only three days after
hijacking an 18-wheeler.

17:52.831 --> 17:57.601
Wrong again, Defective.
I didn't hijack nothin'.

17:57.603 --> 17:59.536
And look at that price.

17:59.538 --> 18:01.471
Over $200,000. Wow!

18:01.473 --> 18:03.206
That's steep.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.842
Although, with the $300,000
you made out with

18:05.844 --> 18:08.245
from the truck heist,
that actually leaves you

18:08.247 --> 18:12.082
plenty of gas money,
give or take $100,000.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.189
I got to hand it
to you, Reagan.

18:19.191 --> 18:21.691
You almost made me
flinch there, almost.

18:21.693 --> 18:25.061
Almost. He is a tough nut
to crack, I got to say.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.964
But your old pal
and cohort, Nicky Farina,

18:27.966 --> 18:30.533
he's not so tough to crack.

18:30.535 --> 18:32.702
Nicky?

18:32.704 --> 18:33.870
You talked to Nicky?

18:33.872 --> 18:36.573
I didn't talk to Nicky,
but Nicky did talk to me.

18:36.575 --> 18:37.941
Get out of here.
- Oh, yeah.

18:37.943 --> 18:40.777
Just a few minutes ago, right
around the corner, actually.

18:40.779 --> 18:42.078
Anyway, see you.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.913
What, he's over here?

18:43.915 --> 18:45.915
Well, not for long.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.043
No, no, he doesn't want
to see you right now.

18:48.067 --> 18:48.786
No, no, let me see.

18:48.787 --> 18:50.220
He's feeling a little bad
about...

18:50.222 --> 18:52.022
No, no, let me see.

18:52.024 --> 18:53.423
Hey, Baez.

18:56.294 --> 18:59.362
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

18:59.364 --> 19:01.197
Uh-uh.

19:01.199 --> 19:02.799
That's my car.

19:02.801 --> 19:05.468
Your car's over there.

19:16.442 --> 19:17.909
I don't know
about this, Reagan.

19:17.911 --> 19:20.478
Look, all you got to do is
sit in the box with Farina

19:20.480 --> 19:22.380
and have him sign
some generic paperwork.

19:22.382 --> 19:24.015
I'll walk Lugo past.

19:24.017 --> 19:25.884
He sees his buddy
scribbling something down,

19:25.886 --> 19:27.886
and then this hamster
does the rest.

19:27.888 --> 19:29.154
I'm not doubting
that it will work.

19:29.156 --> 19:31.022
Then what?

19:31.024 --> 19:33.925
It just feels wrong.
What feels wrong?

19:33.927 --> 19:35.260
Lying.

19:35.262 --> 19:37.062
We're allowed to lie.

19:37.064 --> 19:38.697
Okay, deceit is
perfectly legal.

19:38.699 --> 19:39.831
It doesn't mean it's right.

19:39.833 --> 19:41.967
We're not the God Squad,
we're the cops.

19:41.969 --> 19:44.202
Okay, if it holds up
in court, we do it.

19:44.204 --> 19:45.503
Come on.
Come on.

19:45.505 --> 19:48.807
Okay, but I still don't
feel good about this.

19:48.809 --> 19:50.542
Then we'll visit
confession after

19:50.544 --> 19:52.911
and you'll feel all better--
get in there.

19:55.181 --> 19:57.048
Victor Lugo.

20:02.955 --> 20:05.090
Hey...

20:05.092 --> 20:07.592
Oh, yeah, that.

20:07.594 --> 20:08.760
Well, you know the game.

20:08.762 --> 20:11.429
Whoever cooperates first
gets the deal.

20:14.967 --> 20:18.903
He can't see you, Einstein.

20:18.905 --> 20:21.973
So much for honor
amongst thieves, huh?

20:24.710 --> 20:26.711
Give me a pen.
Let's do this.

20:26.713 --> 20:29.814
Okay, right this way.

20:33.586 --> 20:35.720
Detective, not another
word to my client.

20:35.722 --> 20:36.988
Talbott, what are
you doing here?

20:36.990 --> 20:38.289
And you keep your mouth shut.

20:38.291 --> 20:40.659
Hey!
- Shut it.

20:42.528 --> 20:45.096
Detective Reagan,
valiant effort,

20:45.098 --> 20:46.731
but I'll take things from here,
thank you very much.

20:46.733 --> 20:48.299
You sure you want
to do this, Lugo?

20:48.301 --> 20:52.337
I mean, whoever cooperates last
gets the bottom bunk at Rikers.

20:52.339 --> 20:54.072
Have you ever been
the bottom...?

20:54.074 --> 20:55.540
Another word
to my client, Detective,

20:55.542 --> 20:56.775
and we go right to One PP.

20:56.777 --> 20:57.909
I know some people there.

20:57.911 --> 21:00.078
Yes, you do,
which is why the press

21:00.080 --> 21:02.313
will jump at my tale of you
getting my client down here

21:02.315 --> 21:04.349
on false pretenses
like catnip.

21:04.351 --> 21:05.817
Yeah, I don't read the press.

21:05.819 --> 21:07.118
False pretenses?

21:07.120 --> 21:09.154
- He lied to you, dummy.
- Just a little bit.

21:09.156 --> 21:11.156
Did you say anything?

21:11.158 --> 21:12.457
Not a peep.

21:12.459 --> 21:14.526
Let's go.

21:21.634 --> 21:23.735
You're right to be miffed.

21:23.737 --> 21:27.272
Bullman said Baker
reached out to him.

21:27.274 --> 21:30.108
But you can't blame someone
for wanting a change.

21:30.110 --> 21:31.543
She's young,
she's sharp.

21:31.545 --> 21:32.677
That's not it.

21:32.679 --> 21:33.778
According to the guys,

21:33.780 --> 21:35.747
she said he reached out to her.

21:35.749 --> 21:38.049
What does it matter
who called who?

21:38.051 --> 21:41.586
Well, Baker slots easily
into a whole lot of roles.

21:41.588 --> 21:43.888
But Internal Affairs?
Not top of my list.

21:43.890 --> 21:45.523
But maybe hers.

21:45.525 --> 21:47.859
I don't think so.

21:47.861 --> 21:50.628
And it's been ten years
since she worked for the guy.

21:50.630 --> 21:54.199
He's been closer longer to a
whole lot of people since then.

21:54.201 --> 21:56.735
Why reach so far back
into the past?

21:56.737 --> 21:59.604
Because of where she sits
in the present,

21:59.606 --> 22:02.407
right next to the PC every day.

22:03.876 --> 22:07.378
He'd be hiring a great big hook
into One PP.

22:08.681 --> 22:10.415
There you go.

22:10.417 --> 22:11.983
Thank you.

22:11.985 --> 22:13.651
Well, I'm just playing
along here, Francis.

22:13.653 --> 22:15.587
I'm not saying that's
definitely the motive.

22:15.589 --> 22:17.222
But more than just
a possibility.

22:17.224 --> 22:20.825
But one that there's no way
you can bring up to her

22:20.827 --> 22:23.762
without insulting her
to her core.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.934
But there's a trust there.

22:29.936 --> 22:33.471
Between boss and subordinate.

22:33.473 --> 22:37.075
But you can't just turn around
and be the friend from work

22:37.077 --> 22:38.676
with the sympathetic ear

22:38.678 --> 22:40.678
and the sound advice.

22:40.680 --> 22:44.482
Those days are long gone.

22:59.565 --> 23:02.066
Hey, good news. Your
sister just showed up.

23:02.068 --> 23:03.268
You mean bad news.

23:03.270 --> 23:04.636
Bad news-- how do you know?

23:04.638 --> 23:07.272
Reagan thing-- good news
is easy; bad news, you show up.

23:08.974 --> 23:10.842
No go?

23:10.844 --> 23:12.510
Bucks County DA
gave me a hard no.

23:12.512 --> 23:14.179
Because he's a hard-ass
or because he knows something

23:14.181 --> 23:15.246
on this that we don't?

23:15.248 --> 23:16.314
Reading between
the lines,

23:16.316 --> 23:17.949
he's up for reelection.

23:17.951 --> 23:21.519
Oh, and his opponent's hammering
him for being soft on crime?

23:21.521 --> 23:23.087
Pretty much.

23:23.089 --> 23:24.589
So my guy's collateral damage?

23:24.591 --> 23:26.424
Well, he did commit
a felony, Jamie.

23:26.426 --> 23:28.159
A four-year-old E felony,

23:28.161 --> 23:30.261
and the kid's got zero record
before or since.

23:30.263 --> 23:31.796
Well, I'm sorry,
but it is what it is.

23:31.798 --> 23:32.931
Did you tell him
what my guy did?

23:32.933 --> 23:34.132
Did you tell him that he
single-handedly

23:34.134 --> 23:35.233
saved those three girls' lives?

23:35.235 --> 23:37.168
Of course I did,
but he's a politician.

23:37.170 --> 23:39.604
If there's nothing in it for
him, then it never happened.

23:39.606 --> 23:42.574
Okay. Thank you for trying.
You should know

23:42.576 --> 23:44.909
they're gonna try to extradite
him to Pennsylvania today.

23:44.911 --> 23:47.645
Okay, on it.

23:55.454 --> 23:57.021
You got the Mack file?

23:57.023 --> 24:00.692
We really have
to transfer him now?

24:00.694 --> 24:01.759
Yeah, forthwith.

24:14.440 --> 24:15.640
Hey, what are you doing?

24:15.642 --> 24:16.674
I asked you for the Mack file.

24:16.676 --> 24:17.842
Yeah, and I...

24:18.878 --> 24:22.814
I, uh, I thought
you had it last.

24:22.816 --> 24:24.215
Me? No, I thought you had it.

24:24.217 --> 24:25.783
Are you sure?

24:25.785 --> 24:27.785
Let's check our desks.
It's got to be there somewhere.

24:27.787 --> 24:29.888
Oh.

24:29.890 --> 24:32.624
Hey, what are we doing?

24:43.869 --> 24:45.236
How come you're not saying
anything to me?

24:45.238 --> 24:48.606
Because I've nothing to say.

24:48.608 --> 24:50.575
You are so mad at me.

24:50.577 --> 24:52.777
I am so not mad at you.

24:52.779 --> 24:55.113
Well, if you're not mad now,

24:55.115 --> 24:56.781
you're about to be.
- Why?

24:56.783 --> 24:58.850
Detective.

25:00.386 --> 25:02.086
Uh, Detective Reagan?

25:02.088 --> 25:03.955
Wh-What are you?

25:03.957 --> 25:08.059
♪ Oh, Detective Danny

25:08.061 --> 25:11.429
♪ You are so defective

25:11.431 --> 25:12.997
♪ With every objective

25:12.999 --> 25:15.466

25:15.468 --> 25:17.835

25:17.837 --> 25:19.771

25:25.946 --> 25:29.948
♪ You are defective.

25:32.551 --> 25:36.254
Uh, compliments of,
uh, Victor Lugo.

25:36.256 --> 25:37.588
Are you done now?

25:37.590 --> 25:38.656
Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry.

25:38.658 --> 25:39.724
Good, then get the hell
out of here.

25:39.726 --> 25:41.492
- Thank you.
- My uncle's a cop. Thank you.

25:41.494 --> 25:42.694
Get out of here.

25:44.264 --> 25:46.064
Go ahead,
help yourselves.

25:47.299 --> 25:49.600
Jump in.

25:58.410 --> 26:00.979
I'm probably making more of this
than is necessary.

26:00.981 --> 26:04.282
If it's important to you,
it's important to me.

26:04.284 --> 26:07.618
Thank you.

26:07.620 --> 26:10.388
Baker, it's just
you and me here.

26:10.390 --> 26:13.458
That's the thing.

26:13.460 --> 26:15.994
I have so much respect for you.

26:17.196 --> 26:18.796
Why don't you start with

26:18.798 --> 26:21.632
"We've known each other
a long time"?

26:22.735 --> 26:26.504
Okay.

26:26.506 --> 26:28.439
An opportunity
has come up for me

26:28.441 --> 26:31.576
that I'd like to take
and I'd like your blessing.

26:31.578 --> 26:34.245
At Internal Affairs.

26:35.414 --> 26:37.615
Yes.

26:37.617 --> 26:39.517
Captain Bullman and I worked
closely together

26:39.519 --> 26:40.918
before I came to you,

26:40.920 --> 26:44.555
and he's asked me
to join his team.

26:44.557 --> 26:46.290
He asked you?

26:46.292 --> 26:47.425
Yes, sir.

26:47.427 --> 26:49.360
This is not something
I sought out.

26:49.362 --> 26:51.596
Understood.

26:53.465 --> 26:56.200
I hope you know...

26:56.202 --> 26:59.771
and if you don't, I'm telling
you now, straight up,

26:59.773 --> 27:02.040
how much working with you

27:02.042 --> 27:04.842
and learning from you
has meant to me.

27:04.844 --> 27:07.211
I think I do.

27:07.213 --> 27:09.047
And thank you.

27:14.553 --> 27:17.355
Abigail, you are a smart,
talented detective.

27:17.357 --> 27:20.158
Anybody'd be lucky to have you.

27:23.295 --> 27:27.665
You are most needed here
in this office, however.

27:29.268 --> 27:31.135
What?

27:31.137 --> 27:33.604
I am deny...

27:33.606 --> 27:36.841
I am denying your request
for transfer.

27:42.815 --> 27:46.517
I'm sorry, I know that's not
the news you wanted to hear.

27:46.519 --> 27:49.754
No, it's not.

27:49.756 --> 27:54.058
Be that as it may,
that is my decision.

27:57.129 --> 27:59.564
That's it?
No discussion.

27:59.566 --> 28:03.367
We just had the discussion.

28:07.673 --> 28:11.542
I will be at my desk
if you need me.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.527
I've already given you
my answer, Detective.

28:32.551 --> 28:33.365
I know.

28:33.366 --> 28:36.367
And I respect that, I do.
Obviously not.

28:36.369 --> 28:39.203
No, I do. It's just,
there's more to it than that.

28:39.205 --> 28:40.438
Yeah, for you.

28:40.440 --> 28:43.241
No, for you, too.
For all of us.

28:43.243 --> 28:44.842
Us? Wh-Who's us?

28:44.844 --> 28:46.911
You know, the truck drivers,
the neighborhood,

28:46.913 --> 28:48.646
the city, the country. Hell...

28:48.648 --> 28:50.515
the whole damn world,

28:50.517 --> 28:52.383
when you really
get down to it.

28:52.385 --> 28:54.185
The whole damn world?
- Yes.

28:54.187 --> 28:57.722
If everybody in your situation
made the same decision you made,

28:57.724 --> 29:01.926
because you're afraid, we'd have
no bad guys behind bars.

29:01.928 --> 29:04.996
I'm not everybody else.

29:04.998 --> 29:07.098
I'm Roberto Alonzo.

29:07.100 --> 29:08.833
Husband to Maria Alonzo

29:08.835 --> 29:13.471
and father to Randy, Ana,
and Julie Alonzo.

29:13.473 --> 29:15.273
I know that.

29:17.543 --> 29:19.010
I have to get back to work.

29:30.422 --> 29:31.822
You're empty-handed.

29:31.824 --> 29:33.024
Yeah, you were right.

29:33.026 --> 29:34.058
You happy?

29:34.060 --> 29:35.626
Not very,
but I get it.

29:35.628 --> 29:36.861
Well, I don't get it.

29:36.863 --> 29:38.029
Who are you calling?

29:38.031 --> 29:39.163
Don't worry about it.

29:39.165 --> 29:40.431
This guy doesn't want
to do the right thing,

29:40.433 --> 29:41.399
I'll do it for him.

29:41.401 --> 29:42.533
Well, what
are you doing?

29:42.535 --> 29:43.801
Just trust me.

29:43.803 --> 29:46.737
- Victor Lugo.
- Hey-- Shh. Danny, don't.

29:46.739 --> 29:50.208
Hey. It's your old pal,
Defective Reagan.

29:50.210 --> 29:52.543
Yeah. I wanted to thank you
for the doughnuts.

29:52.545 --> 29:54.445
That was very,
very thoughtful.

29:54.447 --> 29:56.781
I also wanted to let you know
that you just purchased yourself

29:56.783 --> 30:00.117
a first-class ticket
to Rikers Island, my friend.

30:00.119 --> 30:02.019
Oh, yeah, you did.

30:02.021 --> 30:05.056
Because that truck driver
you robbed, Roberto Alonzo,

30:05.058 --> 30:07.058
he picked you out
of a photo array.

30:07.060 --> 30:09.093
So hope you have a nice trip.

30:09.095 --> 30:10.928
- What the hell are you doing?
- Just...

30:10.930 --> 30:12.997
You just signed that
man's death certificate.

30:12.999 --> 30:15.466
You happy?

30:36.179 --> 30:38.447
♪

30:55.298 --> 30:57.566
♪

31:24.661 --> 31:26.462
Police! Drop it!

31:26.464 --> 31:28.097
What the hell?

31:28.099 --> 31:29.965
Turn around!

31:30.834 --> 31:32.902
Turn around...

31:34.738 --> 31:36.272
Victor Lugo...

31:38.209 --> 31:39.575
...you're under arrest.

31:39.577 --> 31:42.578
Guess your plan was
a little defective, huh?

31:44.448 --> 31:46.916
<i>There you are.</i>

31:46.918 --> 31:48.017
I've been looking
all over for you.

31:48.019 --> 31:49.318
Did you get any
of my texts?

31:49.320 --> 31:50.419
Yes.

31:50.421 --> 31:52.121
Were you going to
respond to any of them?

31:52.123 --> 31:53.088
I was busy.

31:53.090 --> 31:54.223
Doing what?

31:54.225 --> 31:55.391
Things.

31:55.393 --> 31:57.259
Great. While you were
busy doing "things""

31:57.261 --> 31:59.128
I was getting chewed
out by the sergeant.

31:59.130 --> 32:00.863
Yeah. I saw.

32:00.865 --> 32:04.466
Did you also see that I had
to turn over Parker's file?

32:04.468 --> 32:07.136
I tried to stall, but
he was not having it.

32:07.138 --> 32:08.904
I know.
And it's gonna be fine.

32:08.906 --> 32:11.273
How is that gonna be fine?
They are prepping Parker

32:11.275 --> 32:13.609
for extradition to
Pennsylvania as we speak.

32:13.611 --> 32:15.978
Look, it's gonna be
what it's gonna be.

32:15.980 --> 32:19.415
I cannot believe you are
being this blasé about it.

32:19.417 --> 32:21.550
I can.

32:21.552 --> 32:23.118
Hey.
- Erin?

32:23.120 --> 32:25.087
What, you didn't tell her?

32:25.089 --> 32:26.188
Tell her what?

32:26.190 --> 32:27.289
Come on.

32:27.291 --> 32:28.924
You really think
I'm gonna fall for that?

32:28.926 --> 32:30.826
Fall for what?
Tell me what?

32:30.828 --> 32:32.294
I don't know what
she's talking about.

32:32.296 --> 32:33.796
You're a
terrible liar.

32:33.798 --> 32:36.198
But you're
a pretty damn good person.

32:37.233 --> 32:39.902
What the hell's going on?

32:39.904 --> 32:42.404
I just got a call
from the Bucks County DA

32:42.406 --> 32:44.506
Turns out he's had
a change of heart.

32:44.508 --> 32:46.442
Dropped all the charges
against Parker.

32:46.444 --> 32:47.876
Apparently,
all three women

32:47.878 --> 32:49.445
that Parker saved
reversed their decision

32:49.447 --> 32:51.814
not to talk to the press
and gave an exclusive interview

32:51.816 --> 32:54.450
to a local reporter
in Pennsylvania.

32:55.452 --> 32:57.720
And you put that together?

32:57.722 --> 32:59.188
Your guy

32:59.190 --> 33:01.123
is now a local hero.

33:01.125 --> 33:05.260
The DA had no choice
but to vacate his warrant.

33:18.308 --> 33:19.575
Pass the potatoes, Pop?

33:19.577 --> 33:21.343
No.

33:21.345 --> 33:23.779
What do you mean, no?

33:23.781 --> 33:27.149
Hold on, hold on.

33:27.151 --> 33:28.350
What's going on, Gramps?

33:29.419 --> 33:31.720
Before I pass you anything,
I need to know,

33:31.722 --> 33:33.656
since when did we go
into the business

33:33.658 --> 33:36.058
of just letting criminals
walk away?

33:36.060 --> 33:37.826
Well, that's not
exactly the case.

33:37.828 --> 33:40.129
Says his coconspirator.
Wait a minute.

33:40.131 --> 33:42.164
The guy was a Good Samaritan.
Yeah.

33:42.166 --> 33:43.632
A hero, even.
Under attack,

33:43.634 --> 33:44.967
he helped save
three women

33:44.969 --> 33:47.302
who were being held
and tortured by some psycho.

33:47.304 --> 33:48.771
He was also a fugitive

33:48.773 --> 33:51.373
with an outstanding warrant
for grand theft auto.

33:52.242 --> 33:53.976
You getting in on this, too,
huh, Dad?

33:53.978 --> 33:56.845
Well, you know me and Pop,
we like things done by the book.

33:56.847 --> 34:00.049
The book is there
for a very good reason.

34:00.051 --> 34:02.718
With no room for common
sense interpretation?

34:02.720 --> 34:04.420
He didn't know
the car was stolen.

34:04.422 --> 34:05.554
He able to prove that?

34:05.556 --> 34:07.189
Well, not forensically.

34:07.191 --> 34:08.090
How, then?

34:08.092 --> 34:09.692
I believed him.

34:09.694 --> 34:11.527
And I believed him.

34:11.529 --> 34:14.129
I thought you were a cop and a
lawyer, not a judge and a jury.

34:14.130 --> 34:16.031
And I'm really starting
to love this whole thing.

34:16.033 --> 34:17.466
Love what?

34:17.467 --> 34:20.869
This. Restoring law and order
to the family dinner table.

34:20.871 --> 34:23.806
All you need to know
is in the book.

34:24.708 --> 34:26.041
Well, not all. But continue,

34:26.043 --> 34:27.976
please, Gramps.
I'm pretty sure

34:27.978 --> 34:29.745
that the oath
cops take

34:29.746 --> 34:31.013
does not include a phrase

34:31.014 --> 34:33.982
about taking the law
into your own hands.

34:33.984 --> 34:35.684
Right.

34:35.686 --> 34:37.920
This is a lot, Pop,
even coming from you.

34:37.922 --> 34:39.188
Yeah, Grandpa.

34:39.190 --> 34:41.056
Nicky?

34:41.058 --> 34:42.491
Sean?

34:42.493 --> 34:43.458
Jack?

34:43.460 --> 34:45.027
Do you get our point?

34:45.029 --> 34:47.830
Yes and no.

34:47.831 --> 34:48.697
I think so.

34:48.699 --> 34:49.764
Some.

34:49.766 --> 34:53.168
Well, what is our point?

34:54.003 --> 34:55.337
That the law,

34:55.339 --> 34:56.804
on the books and by the books,

34:56.806 --> 34:59.108
always beats what cops
and attorneys think are...

34:59.110 --> 35:01.176
What's that word,
before "circumstances"?

35:01.178 --> 35:02.377
"Extenuating."

35:02.379 --> 35:04.012
Right. That.

35:04.014 --> 35:06.615
But then you might as well have
software and robots

35:06.617 --> 35:07.616
handing out justice.

35:07.618 --> 35:09.818
So...

35:09.820 --> 35:11.420
I'm with Mom and Uncle Jamie.

35:12.622 --> 35:14.156
Boys?
- Um,

35:14.158 --> 35:16.158
yeah, I got to say...

35:16.160 --> 35:18.193
well, what she said.

35:19.629 --> 35:21.764
Sorry. I'm with Nicky
on this one.

35:21.766 --> 35:23.198
Don't be sorry.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.867
Music to my ears.

35:24.869 --> 35:27.369
What?

35:27.371 --> 35:28.904
How can it be music
to your ears?

35:28.906 --> 35:30.572
They just disagreed
with everything you guys said.

35:30.574 --> 35:34.243
As my granddaughter
rightly said,

35:34.245 --> 35:37.980
even a robot can be programmed
to strictly go by the book.

35:37.982 --> 35:40.749
The good cop,
the valuable lawyer

35:40.751 --> 35:42.918
can put the book down

35:42.920 --> 35:45.354
and look into the heart
of the matter.

35:50.226 --> 35:52.828
What was this whole thing, just
some con you guys cooked up?

35:52.830 --> 35:54.029
No, no, no, no, no, it's just

35:54.031 --> 35:56.298
what they call
"a teaching moment" nowadays.

35:56.300 --> 35:58.834
They also still call it
a con and a scam.

35:58.836 --> 35:59.768
Teaching moment.

35:59.770 --> 36:00.936
Mm-hmm.

36:00.938 --> 36:03.172
And they all passed
with flying colors.

36:03.174 --> 36:04.973
The next generation
of a long, proud line.

36:04.975 --> 36:06.308
Hear, hear!

36:06.310 --> 36:07.843
Well, next time
your run a con on me,

36:07.845 --> 36:10.045
could you let me in on it?
Gave me indigestion.

36:10.047 --> 36:11.513
Well, if I let you in on it,

36:11.515 --> 36:13.015
it wouldn't be a con, now,
would it?

36:17.453 --> 36:19.154
Unbelievable.

36:30.500 --> 36:32.868
I'll be honest with you, Reagan,
when you lied to Lugo

36:32.870 --> 36:34.903
about Roberto I.D.'ing him,

36:34.905 --> 36:37.706
I thought you'd officially
gone off the deep end.

36:37.708 --> 36:39.508
You really thought
I was just gonna

36:39.510 --> 36:41.910
leave that poor guy
out to dry like that?

36:41.912 --> 36:43.879
Well, I know how much
Lugo got under your skin.

36:43.881 --> 36:47.149
Hey, no, that clown did
not get under my skin, okay?

36:47.151 --> 36:49.184
"Defective Reagan"?

36:49.186 --> 36:51.453
Didn't bother me.
Hmm. Right.

36:51.455 --> 36:53.155
<i>That's why we're</i>
<i>driving around in his car?</i>

36:53.157 --> 36:54.489
It's not my fault this vehicle

36:54.491 --> 36:58.026
was purchased with funds
derived from criminal activity.

36:58.028 --> 37:00.963
Which, incidentally,
make it subject to, uh,

37:00.965 --> 37:03.832
confiscation under asset,

37:03.834 --> 37:06.335
uh, uh...

37:06.337 --> 37:08.637
Forfeiture.
- Forfeiture guidelines.

37:08.639 --> 37:12.007
See? I learned a lot
working with the DEA.

37:16.846 --> 37:18.647
Hang on one second.

37:28.258 --> 37:29.758
Whoa!

37:30.828 --> 37:33.095
What the hell are you doing?

37:37.533 --> 37:40.369
Hey, isn't that Lugo
sitting right there?

37:43.440 --> 37:46.174
Hi, Victor!

37:52.048 --> 37:55.250
We'll be seeing you around.

37:55.252 --> 37:57.419
Bye!

37:58.721 --> 37:59.821
Hang on.

38:19.208 --> 38:21.877
Excuse me,
is this seat taken?

38:23.413 --> 38:25.447
Commissioner.

38:25.449 --> 38:27.249
I was expecting Garrett.

38:27.251 --> 38:30.385
I know.
He sends his regrets.

38:33.022 --> 38:34.456
What can I get for you?

38:34.458 --> 38:35.557
What he's having.

38:35.559 --> 38:36.758
This is straight whiskey.

38:36.760 --> 38:38.827
What he's having, please.
And back him up.

38:42.265 --> 38:46.001
What my gut tells me?
- Shoot.

38:46.003 --> 38:47.669
The boys told you
about the offer,

38:47.671 --> 38:48.870
and you led them to believe

38:48.872 --> 38:50.305
that you were going
to sign off on it.

38:50.307 --> 38:51.907
Based on what I knew, yeah.
And then,

38:51.909 --> 38:53.408
you pulled the rug
right out from under me.

38:53.410 --> 38:55.577
Well, that's one
way to put it.

38:56.846 --> 39:00.248
So I dusted myself off,
tried to focus.

39:00.250 --> 39:03.652
What I knew was
you're a hard guy,

39:03.654 --> 39:06.355
but not a mean or petty one.

39:06.357 --> 39:07.622
At least I thought I knew.

39:07.624 --> 39:10.158
I hope you know.

39:10.160 --> 39:12.127
I reached out
to Captain Bullman,

39:12.129 --> 39:15.497
asked if you'd contacted him
about the transfer request.

39:15.499 --> 39:17.766
He said you'd
stopped by his office.

39:20.903 --> 39:23.538
I was able to glean

39:23.540 --> 39:26.341
that he'd framed his offer
as a response to me

39:26.343 --> 39:29.811
asking him to get me
transferred there.

39:29.813 --> 39:32.481
But the offer originated
with him.

39:37.954 --> 39:39.888
Why do you think he
fudged it with me?

39:39.890 --> 39:42.324
I gleaned that he thought
it would be seen as poaching

39:42.326 --> 39:44.059
if you knew the offer
came from him.

39:44.061 --> 39:45.660
I mean, there's always
a push and pull

39:45.662 --> 39:48.697
between divisions to
harvest the best people.

39:48.699 --> 39:51.333
Yes, but not out of your office.
That's just not done.

39:53.069 --> 39:55.237
And that told you...

39:57.173 --> 40:00.042
That my real value
to Captain Bullman

40:00.044 --> 40:03.178
was as a hook into One PP.

40:04.280 --> 40:08.350
And I came to
the same conclusion.

40:09.452 --> 40:11.286
But there was no way
of sharing your doubts

40:11.288 --> 40:14.089
without insulting
the living crap out of me.

40:14.091 --> 40:15.290
At least.

40:15.292 --> 40:17.993
So instead of sending me off
to be a pawn,

40:17.995 --> 40:20.295
you denied the transfer request
without telling me why.

40:20.297 --> 40:22.130
- 'Cause I couldn't.
- Yes, you could have.

40:22.132 --> 40:23.999
Maybe someone else,
but not me.

40:24.001 --> 40:25.367
If you're waiting
for a thank you,

40:25.369 --> 40:26.501
don't hold your breath.

40:26.503 --> 40:27.769
I'm not.

40:29.439 --> 40:33.041
How 'bout just...
case closed?

40:33.043 --> 40:37.746
Okay, case closed.

40:44.088 --> 40:46.621
Nice work, Detective.
