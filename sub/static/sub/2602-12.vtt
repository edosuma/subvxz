WEBVTT

00:00.229 --> 00:02.679
He's here.
Boyle is here.

00:02.680 --> 00:03.980
This is so fun!

00:03.981 --> 00:06.482
I wish you guys
got shot more often.

00:06.517 --> 00:09.452
Buh-buh-buh-back
in the nine nine.

00:11.889 --> 00:13.122
Welcome back, Detective.

00:13.157 --> 00:14.324
Wow, is this all for me?

00:14.325 --> 00:15.324
<i>Of course it is.</i>

00:15.326 --> 00:16.359
What're you wearing,
there, buddy?

00:16.360 --> 00:18.962
Oh, none of my pants
fit over my butt cast.

00:18.963 --> 00:21.297
Lucky for me my
lent me her leg warmers.

00:21.332 --> 00:22.832
That is lucky.

00:22.833 --> 00:24.534
Pretty sweet scooter.

00:24.568 --> 00:26.336
Yeah, I know.
Check out these doughnuts.

00:26.337 --> 00:28.838
Whoo-hoo!

00:28.872 --> 00:31.007
Oh, that went terribly.
Can I help you with something?

00:31.041 --> 00:33.176
Nope, nope.
Everything's under control.

00:33.177 --> 00:34.877
I picked up a couple
reacher grabbers.

00:34.912 --> 00:36.112
Yeah.

00:36.113 --> 00:38.047
So I'm able to do
everything that I used to do.

00:38.082 --> 00:39.949
So now, if you'll excuse me,

00:39.984 --> 00:41.985
I'm going to go make myself
a morning cup of coffee

00:41.986 --> 00:43.886
like I do every day.

00:43.921 --> 00:46.522
Okay, okay.

00:46.557 --> 00:48.157
<i>Just gotta...
No problem.</i>

00:50.194 --> 00:52.028
Oh...
The heart is the hardest part.

00:53.030 --> 00:54.564
Let me get that
for you, Boyle.

00:54.598 --> 00:56.099
No need. No need at all.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.533
That's sweet, Rosa.
Here we go.

00:57.534 --> 00:58.701
<i>Ah...</i>

00:58.736 --> 01:00.570
Hey, Charles, just take
my coffee. It's fresh.

01:00.604 --> 01:03.339
Okay, I guess.
I mean, if you don't mind.

01:03.340 --> 01:05.308
All right, you got it? Ah...

01:05.342 --> 01:06.676
No problem.

01:06.710 --> 01:07.910
Why wouldn't you
just use your other hand?

01:07.945 --> 01:11.530
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
Hot coffee in my cast!

01:11.548 --> 01:12.547
Ah!

01:12.549 --> 01:15.051
Ah...

01:15.085 --> 01:16.152
Cold milk.

01:16.186 --> 01:17.820
Cold milk.

01:17.855 --> 01:19.055
That's coming out
the bottom.

01:19.056 --> 01:20.156
It is coming out the bottom
of my cast.

01:20.157 --> 01:21.391

Hey.

01:45.015 --> 01:46.282
What's going on?

01:46.283 --> 01:48.318
Just picked him up on a dozen
counts of identity theft.

01:48.352 --> 01:49.886
His name is Doug Judy.

01:49.920 --> 01:52.388
You ever seen him before?
No.

01:57.461 --> 02:00.363
<i>♪ Beautiful Rosa</i>

02:00.364 --> 02:01.364
I think he's into me.

02:01.365 --> 02:02.632
What do you do
to these perps?

02:02.633 --> 02:05.268
Fear is a powerful
aphrodisiac.

02:05.269 --> 02:08.003
Anyway, he said he wants
to speak to "John

02:08.005 --> 02:10.506
or Jack Peralta
or whatever."

02:10.507 --> 02:11.641
What does he want
with me?

02:11.642 --> 02:13.810
And should I change my name
to Jack Peralta?

02:13.811 --> 02:15.311
That sounds badass.

02:15.312 --> 02:17.914
Jack Peralta, crocodile hunter.

02:17.948 --> 02:19.248
Yeah.

02:19.249 --> 02:20.550
He said he wants a deal.

02:20.584 --> 02:22.819
He has some information about
some dude who steals Pontiacs.

02:22.853 --> 02:25.722
Pontiacs? He knows about
the Pontiac bandit.

02:25.756 --> 02:27.623
Listen to me,
he specifically said

02:27.624 --> 02:28.825
he knows a guy
who steals Pontiacs?

02:28.826 --> 02:30.226
Yeah, I just said that.
Chill, man.

02:30.227 --> 02:32.095
Okay.

02:32.129 --> 02:34.364
Okay, sorry.

02:34.365 --> 02:37.533
M'kay.

02:37.534 --> 02:38.901
<i>Hey, Diaz.</i>

02:38.902 --> 02:40.403
Come here
and talk to me.

02:40.404 --> 02:42.138
This dude is super horny.

02:42.139 --> 02:43.539
Yeah.

02:45.008 --> 02:48.344
Ah. Whoa.

02:56.420 --> 02:57.920
<i>Backing up, guys.</i>

02:57.921 --> 02:59.922
Oh, are you? Huh.

02:59.923 --> 03:01.591
Please get
out of my way. I am physically disabled.

03:01.625 --> 03:03.192
One of these buttons...

03:03.227 --> 03:04.861
Sorry, sorry.

03:04.862 --> 03:06.429
Oh, you don't have to apologize
for anything, Boyle.

03:06.463 --> 03:07.997
You were shot
in the line of duty,

03:08.031 --> 03:09.732
defending a fellow
officer.

03:09.733 --> 03:12.368
You know, the doctor said
that if the bullet

03:12.369 --> 03:14.070
was two millimeters
to the left

03:14.071 --> 03:16.606
and a foot higher, I might
never have walked again.

03:16.607 --> 03:18.441
Everyone here appreciates
your heroism, Boyle.

03:18.442 --> 03:20.209
We all want your
first day back

03:20.210 --> 03:22.779
to be as pleasant and
as comfortable as possible.

03:22.780 --> 03:23.980
Right, detectives?

03:23.981 --> 03:25.415
Absolutely.

03:25.416 --> 03:28.284
Hey, Boyle. You want to choose
where we order lunch from today?

03:28.285 --> 03:31.287
Really? You're lifting
the lifetime ban?

03:31.288 --> 03:33.389
I thought my
lunch choices were

03:33.390 --> 03:35.858
"horrifying
adventures in diarrhea."

03:35.859 --> 03:37.193
Today, Charles, we take
that adventure with you.

03:37.194 --> 03:38.694
<i>All right!</i>

03:38.695 --> 03:40.229
I've been craving
Sudanese all day.

03:40.230 --> 03:42.465
<i>I'll print out some menus.</i>

03:42.466 --> 03:44.967
Ouch.

03:44.968 --> 03:47.003
You ran over my foot.

03:47.004 --> 03:50.440
I am in incredible pain.

03:50.441 --> 03:52.341
I used to work
at a chop shop.

03:52.376 --> 03:55.745
It was chill.
Decent hours, good benefits.

03:55.746 --> 03:58.047
You could work
while you were High.

03:58.081 --> 04:00.082
Which I never did,
'cause that's irresponsible.

04:00.117 --> 04:02.018
Anyway, we did a lot
of work for this dude

04:02.019 --> 04:03.786
who stole Pontiacs.

04:03.787 --> 04:05.154
The Pontiac bandit!

04:05.155 --> 04:09.091
Okay. We called him bill,
but whatever.

04:09.092 --> 04:11.627
No, not whatever. The Pontiac
bandit is my Nemesis.

04:11.628 --> 04:13.329
I've been chasing
this guy for eight years.

04:13.330 --> 04:15.498
He's stolen hundreds of cars,
all of them Pontiacs.

04:15.499 --> 04:16.866
<i>He's never left
any evidence,</i>

04:16.867 --> 04:18.301
and he's never
been caught on Cam

04:18.302 --> 04:19.302
the guy is a ghost.

04:19.303 --> 04:20.303
Super ghost.

04:20.303 --> 04:21.303
He's a super ghost!

04:21.305 --> 04:22.505
Before we go any further,

04:22.506 --> 04:23.706
we need to know
if you're for real.

04:23.740 --> 04:24.774
Describe the guy.

04:24.775 --> 04:25.774
<i>Asian dude.</i>

04:25.776 --> 04:27.677
Maybe 5'8",
spiky black hair.

04:27.678 --> 04:31.013
Rocks in both ears.
Always wears a black suit.

04:31.014 --> 04:32.615
And speaks with
a British accent.

04:32.616 --> 04:36.319
Like my girl Dame Judi Dench.
I have impeccable taste.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.454
So would you say
he looks sort of like...

04:38.455 --> 04:39.455
This?

04:39.456 --> 04:40.923
That's bill.

04:40.924 --> 04:42.458
This is a composite sketch
from ten interviews I've done.

04:42.459 --> 04:43.626
Perfect match.

04:43.627 --> 04:46.662
So all you know is what
a bunch of other mopes

04:46.663 --> 04:47.663
have said over the years.

04:47.664 --> 04:49.131
Anything else?

04:49.132 --> 04:52.335
Yeah. I know how to get
in touch with him.

04:52.336 --> 04:55.705
Doug Judy!

04:55.706 --> 04:57.507
You wanted to see me,
Captain?

04:57.508 --> 05:00.309
My husband's dog cheddar had
relations with our neighbor dog

05:00.310 --> 05:02.879
karate and produced
these two smaller dogs

05:02.880 --> 05:06.616
he insisted that I find them a
good home with someone we trust.

05:08.519 --> 05:09.852
You can trust me.

05:09.853 --> 05:11.754
Dogs are my whole life.

05:11.788 --> 05:13.122
Also work.

05:13.123 --> 05:15.324
Doing work
and hanging with dogs.

05:15.325 --> 05:17.593
That's my lifestyle.

05:20.731 --> 05:22.665
You're allergic to dogs,
aren't you? Nope.

05:22.699 --> 05:24.700
I just need an epipen
because my happiness

05:24.701 --> 05:26.402
is making my throat close up.

05:26.403 --> 05:29.805
Hand me the small dog,
Santiago.

05:34.077 --> 05:36.746
So the burner phone
that Doug Judy used

05:36.747 --> 05:38.915
to contact the Pontiac bandit
is at his mom's house.

05:38.916 --> 05:40.683
He's agreed to help us
catch the bandit

05:40.684 --> 05:43.085
if we drop all charges
against him.

05:43.086 --> 05:45.354
How many cars would you say
this Pontiac bandit has stolen?

05:45.355 --> 05:47.089
230 that I know of.

05:47.090 --> 05:49.025
But the real number could be
in the millions.

05:49.026 --> 05:51.027
You're not very good
at math.

05:51.028 --> 05:52.728
What are the charges
against Judy?

05:52.729 --> 05:53.963
12 counts of identity theft,

05:53.964 --> 05:55.531
but I've been chasing him
for a month.

05:55.532 --> 05:57.099
Oh, a month?

05:57.100 --> 05:59.235
I've been trying to catch the
Pontiac bandit for eight years.

05:59.236 --> 06:00.269
You know how many
months that is?

06:00.270 --> 06:01.270
96.

06:01.271 --> 06:03.339
80... 40... and 6
years, months.

06:03.373 --> 06:04.907
Do you need a math tutor?

06:04.908 --> 06:06.375
Because the department
will provide one for you.

06:06.376 --> 06:07.743
I can't tell if
you're being serious.

06:07.744 --> 06:09.278
I'm on the fence here.

06:09.279 --> 06:11.881
Diaz caught him.

06:11.882 --> 06:13.082
It's your call.

06:13.083 --> 06:16.218
Look, this guy is for real.
1,000 push-ups.

06:16.219 --> 06:18.054
1,000 push-ups, really?
Yes.

06:18.055 --> 06:20.923
Okay. I'm in.

06:20.924 --> 06:22.858
<i>What's 1,000 push-ups?</i>

06:22.859 --> 06:24.193
Oh, we were in
the academy together,

06:24.194 --> 06:25.628
and we hated
all the drills, so now

06:25.629 --> 06:27.630
when we're on a case and
one of us says 1,000 push-ups,

06:27.631 --> 06:29.532
it means I'm so sure I'm right

06:29.533 --> 06:31.133
that if I'm wrong,
I'll do 1,000 push-ups.

06:31.134 --> 06:32.501
<i>It's a pact we made.</i>

06:32.536 --> 06:34.670
It really just means
"trust me." And I do.

06:34.705 --> 06:36.105
<i>Okay.</i>

06:36.139 --> 06:37.940
Make the deal.
Yes!

06:37.941 --> 06:41.277
I've got you now,
Pontiac bandit. Whoo!

06:41.278 --> 06:43.245
Feels good to finally say that
in front of actual people

06:43.246 --> 06:44.347
instead of just the mirror.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.239
All right, so we grab
the burner, catch the bandit,

06:48.240 --> 06:50.141
become police legends.

06:50.175 --> 06:53.177
My mom's car is here.
She's home.

06:53.178 --> 06:54.212
Can I take these cuffs off?

06:54.213 --> 06:55.213
No way.

06:55.214 --> 06:56.581
She doesn't know
I'm a criminal.

06:56.582 --> 06:59.317
She thinks I own an architecture
firm with all white employees.

06:59.351 --> 07:00.818
That's racist.

07:00.853 --> 07:02.487
Why stop there? Why not tell her
you're an astronaut?

07:02.521 --> 07:04.289
'Cause space is scary.

07:04.290 --> 07:05.623
You saw what it did
to Sandy bullock.

07:05.658 --> 07:07.091
Yeah, I'm with him
on this one.

07:07.092 --> 07:08.493
I'll stay on earth,
thank you very much.

07:08.494 --> 07:10.495
Yeah.

07:10.529 --> 07:11.896
Come on, Rosa.

07:11.897 --> 07:13.765
We can play-act with his mom
for two minutes to get a lead.

07:13.799 --> 07:15.833
Fine.

07:15.868 --> 07:19.537
One false move, and I tase you
in front of your mom.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.642
Dougie!
Oh, my beautiful boy.

07:25.711 --> 07:27.445
Well, shouldn't you be
at work?

07:27.446 --> 07:29.814
Never too busy to see my mama. Oh.

07:29.815 --> 07:34.185
Mama, this is
my girlfriend Rosa.

07:34.186 --> 07:37.488
And this is my
personal assistant.

07:37.489 --> 07:39.324
Mangy Carl.

07:39.358 --> 07:41.893
Aw, it's nice to meet you.
You can just call me Carl.

07:41.927 --> 07:43.995
Mangy Carl used to be
a homeless gentleman.

07:44.029 --> 07:45.596
I work with a charity
that finds jobs

07:45.631 --> 07:47.498
for down-on-their-luck
white people.

07:47.499 --> 07:48.800
Oh...

07:48.834 --> 07:52.670
He's just a big, old angel.
He's been so good to...

07:52.671 --> 07:53.938
The whites.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.441
Yes, he is.

07:56.475 --> 07:58.042
Yeah.
This guy.

07:58.043 --> 07:59.042
Aw...

08:00.346 --> 08:02.280
Hey, speaking of which, we
should probably grab that phone,

08:02.281 --> 08:05.516
you know, so you can
get back to architecturals.

08:05.551 --> 08:07.085
Yes, it's in
the spare bedroom.

08:07.086 --> 08:09.620
I'll go with you.
It's a mess.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.155
Actually, we can handle it
on our own, ma'am.

08:11.156 --> 08:12.190
Thank you so much.

08:12.191 --> 08:15.026
Why don't you just
stay up here and...

08:15.027 --> 08:17.762
Chop it up with Rosa?

08:17.763 --> 08:19.364
Well, that sounds nice.

08:19.398 --> 08:21.835
We can get to know
each other a little.

08:21.867 --> 08:23.568
I love getting
to know people.

08:23.569 --> 08:24.869
It's my jam.

08:27.539 --> 08:28.939
Oh, how good is this food?

08:28.973 --> 08:30.607
I'm eating it.

08:30.642 --> 08:32.509
They accidentally
put a stone in mine.

08:32.544 --> 08:34.544
Oh, no, no, no, no,
that's the hoof!

08:34.578 --> 08:37.581
That's the best
part of the stew!

08:37.582 --> 08:38.948
Oh, man.

08:38.982 --> 08:42.251
Think of it as marrow nugget
wrapped in a thick toenail.

08:43.788 --> 08:44.922
<i>Mmm.</i>

08:44.923 --> 08:46.490
Hey, did I tell you guys
what the doctor said?

08:46.491 --> 08:47.491
Mm-hmm.

08:47.492 --> 08:48.992
Couple times.

08:48.993 --> 08:51.295
But we'd love
to hear it again.

08:51.296 --> 08:53.764
He said that if the bullet was a
fraction of an inch to the left

08:53.765 --> 08:56.767
and two feet up,
it woulda hit my brain.

08:56.768 --> 08:58.368
Oh...
Yeah.

09:00.772 --> 09:01.939
Oh...

09:01.940 --> 09:06.477
"Back in the game.
When can we meet?"

09:06.478 --> 09:09.646
Damn, you're a good assistant.
I could get used to this.

09:09.647 --> 09:10.848
How long till he usually
gets back to you?

09:10.849 --> 09:13.217
Like ten minutes.
Chill, mangy.

09:13.218 --> 09:15.018
I can't chill. I've never
been this close before.

09:15.019 --> 09:18.122
I gotta admit, your enthusiasm
makes me want you to catch him.

09:18.123 --> 09:19.957
Thank you.

09:19.958 --> 09:21.458
Are these laserdiscs?

09:21.459 --> 09:22.893
Yeah, I robbed
a tower records back in '92.

09:22.894 --> 09:24.428
Kept my faves.

09:24.429 --> 09:26.430
Doug Judy.
Ooh.

09:26.431 --> 09:28.699
<i>Blade runner, tron,</i> oh!

09:28.700 --> 09:29.933
<i>Fievel goes west?</i>

09:29.934 --> 09:32.302
Yes, sir.
Love that little mouse.

09:32.303 --> 09:34.338
His journey...
The story of America.

09:34.339 --> 09:35.873
I could not agree more.

09:35.874 --> 09:37.941
Fievel?
Papa.

09:37.942 --> 09:39.810
Fievel!
Papa!

09:39.811 --> 09:42.179
Fie-vel!
Pa-pa!

09:42.180 --> 09:43.180
Fie-vel!

09:43.181 --> 09:44.181
You guys having fun?

09:44.182 --> 09:45.415
Hey.
'Cause I'm not.

09:45.450 --> 09:47.851
His mom put this stupid
braid in my hair.

09:47.852 --> 09:48.852
Oh, looks beautiful.

09:48.887 --> 09:51.688
Yeah, it's kinda cute.

09:51.689 --> 09:53.524
Please have my children.

09:55.860 --> 09:57.227
It's him.

09:57.228 --> 09:59.663
Parking lot on Flatbush
and Vanderbilt in 15 minutes.

09:59.664 --> 10:01.025
Let's go. <i> Wait, wait, wait.</i>

10:01.032 --> 10:02.699
Diaz looks like
a dirty criminal.

10:02.700 --> 10:03.767
But you look like a cop, man.

10:03.768 --> 10:04.768
You can't go over there
like that.

10:04.769 --> 10:07.971
What'd you have in mind?

10:07.972 --> 10:09.740
♪ Don't call it a comeback

10:09.741 --> 10:11.241
♪ I been here for years

10:11.242 --> 10:12.609
♪ Rockin' my peers
and puttin' suckas in fear ♪

10:12.610 --> 10:15.679
♪ Makin' the tears rain down
like a monsoon ♪

10:15.680 --> 10:17.714
♪ Listen to the bass go boom

10:17.715 --> 10:19.516
♪ Explosion overpowerin'

10:19.517 --> 10:22.352
♪ Over the competition
I'm towerin' ♪

10:22.353 --> 10:25.322
I don't look
like a cop now.

10:25.323 --> 10:27.391
No, you look like
a Boyz II Men Easter album.

10:27.392 --> 10:28.659
Burn.

10:28.693 --> 10:30.627
That's not a burn,
that's cool.

10:31.863 --> 10:33.964
Gina, we've been
looking all over for you.

10:33.965 --> 10:35.432
You can't just disappear

10:35.433 --> 10:37.901
and leave a sign on your desk
that says, "gone leavin'."

10:37.902 --> 10:39.036
<i>I'm hiding from Charles.</i>

10:39.070 --> 10:41.038
I can't take him anymore.

10:41.072 --> 10:42.639
<i>It's safe in here</i>

10:42.640 --> 10:45.542
'cause his scooter can't get up
the steps in the hallway.

10:45.577 --> 10:46.777
Gina, have some compassion.

10:46.778 --> 10:48.679
Boyle got hurt
doing something brave.

10:48.680 --> 10:51.481
You didn't have to do
physical therapy with him, Amy.

10:51.482 --> 10:54.084
Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal,
pedal, pedal, push.

10:54.085 --> 10:57.054
Pedal, pedal, pedal,
pedal, pedal, push.

10:57.055 --> 10:59.456
All this cycling makes me
feel like Lance Armstrong.

10:59.457 --> 11:01.491
Like you use
performance-enhancing drugs

11:01.492 --> 11:02.926
and have one teste?

11:02.927 --> 11:04.561
Wouldn't you like to know?

11:04.596 --> 11:06.897
How long can you
possibly hide in here?

11:06.898 --> 11:08.632
I sent all the Captain's
calls here,

11:08.633 --> 11:10.834
my phone battery's
at 100% charge,

11:10.835 --> 11:12.970
and I have ten loose
diner mints in my purse.

11:12.971 --> 11:15.539
This is my home now.

11:15.573 --> 11:18.942
I gotta say,
the suit is growing on me.

11:18.943 --> 11:19.942
Looks good.

11:19.944 --> 11:21.889
Is it triple-breasted
somehow?

11:21.913 --> 11:22.946
There's no such thing.

11:22.981 --> 11:24.681
What about the girl
in <i>total recall?</i>

11:24.716 --> 11:26.984
Mmm. Triple bitties.

11:26.985 --> 11:28.785
Triple bitties.
Triple bitties. Yeah.

11:28.786 --> 11:29.786
Rosa...

11:29.787 --> 11:31.922
There's no sign of anyone.

11:31.923 --> 11:32.923
<i>You sure about this?</i>

11:32.924 --> 11:33.957
1,000 push-ups.

11:33.958 --> 11:36.260
Okay.

11:36.261 --> 11:39.062
Heads up.

11:40.598 --> 11:42.466
Who the hell are you?
Where's bill?

11:42.467 --> 11:43.800
He hadn't heard
from you in a while,

11:43.801 --> 11:45.736
so he sent me to make sure
everything was cool.

11:45.737 --> 11:46.837
Apparently it's not.

11:46.838 --> 11:48.205
Who are they?

11:48.206 --> 11:49.406
They're with me.

11:49.407 --> 11:52.109
This is the buyer. Carl Mangerman.
'Sup?

11:52.110 --> 11:54.177
I don't know them,
I don't trust them.

11:54.178 --> 11:56.647
He meets with you alone
or it's off.

11:56.681 --> 11:58.382
I'll text the address.

12:01.486 --> 12:02.619
Come on!

12:02.654 --> 12:03.987
I promise you this.

12:03.988 --> 12:07.658
They have not heard the last
of Carl mangerman.

12:07.659 --> 12:11.995
Sergeant, I'd like you
to meet Richard and Dan.

12:11.996 --> 12:12.996
They are puppies.

12:12.997 --> 12:14.865
Very cute, sir.

12:14.866 --> 12:17.501
Maybe your twins would like
some little, furry friends.

12:17.502 --> 12:20.237
I'm sorry, sir,
but that's impossible.

12:20.238 --> 12:21.571
With the twins
learning how to walk,

12:21.572 --> 12:23.607
chaos reigns
at the Jeffords household.

12:23.608 --> 12:26.977
I can't let those innocent
pups into that madhouse.

12:26.978 --> 12:28.578
Terry won't do you like that.

12:28.579 --> 12:29.613
<i>I understand.</i>

12:29.614 --> 12:33.383
Just know you have
disappointed...

12:33.384 --> 12:36.086
All three of us.

12:36.120 --> 12:40.190
That's cold, sir.

12:40.224 --> 12:42.492
All right,
it's worth the risk.

12:42.527 --> 12:44.261
We send him in alone.

12:44.295 --> 12:46.463
No, we do not. Something
doesn't smell right to me.

12:46.464 --> 12:48.498
Could be my dad's suit.
He died in it.

12:48.533 --> 12:49.532
He died in it?

12:49.534 --> 12:53.370
Oh, man.

12:53.371 --> 12:55.439
They just sent the location.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.307
<i>Man, this dude is cautious.</i>

12:57.308 --> 12:59.042
If I show up one minute late
or I'm not alone,

12:59.043 --> 13:00.577
he's done with me.

13:00.578 --> 13:02.045
This is your last shot.

13:02.046 --> 13:03.880
I can't let the Pontiac bandit
get away.

13:03.881 --> 13:06.316
Put a wire on him, get
a tactical team in as backup.

13:06.317 --> 13:07.684
It's the only way.

13:07.685 --> 13:09.219
Doug Judy and I know this guy.
You have to trust us.

13:09.220 --> 13:10.220
Do I?

13:10.221 --> 13:11.355
One of you is a criminal,

13:11.356 --> 13:12.756
and the other one
is dressed like Steve Harvey.

13:12.757 --> 13:14.877
It's over.
I'm ending this now.

13:14.892 --> 13:15.892
Sorry, Jake.

13:15.893 --> 13:17.728
Seriously?

13:17.762 --> 13:19.663
Yeah. 1,000 push-ups.

13:19.697 --> 13:21.565
Well, I raise you.
2,000 push-ups.

13:21.599 --> 13:23.500
What?
That's not how this works.

13:23.501 --> 13:25.168
I said 1,000 push-ups,
you have to back me up.

13:25.169 --> 13:26.470
That's the pact,
end of story.

13:26.471 --> 13:27.904
Well, I break the pact.

13:27.939 --> 13:30.707
I hope you understand
how serious this is to me.

13:30.708 --> 13:31.842
Come on, Rosa.

13:31.876 --> 13:34.344
Can't you read
between the lines, man?

13:34.345 --> 13:35.612
Don't quote <i>die hard.</i>

13:35.613 --> 13:36.947
Sorry.

13:36.948 --> 13:38.515
But we're still
sending him in alone.

13:41.023 --> 13:42.123
<i>We need evidence,
so get him talking.</i>

13:42.124 --> 13:45.293
Ask questions about money,
cars, specifics.

13:45.327 --> 13:48.096
I'm getting kind of nervous,
man. This dude is for real.

13:48.097 --> 13:49.230
You sure you got
everything covered?

13:49.231 --> 13:50.364
Yeah.

13:50.365 --> 13:52.100
<i>There's a body
on the back door,</i>

13:52.101 --> 13:53.668
<i>eyes on the side door,</i>

13:53.702 --> 13:55.670
<i>and two guys out on the corner.
You're gonna be fine.</i>

13:55.704 --> 13:56.738
What about choppers?

13:56.772 --> 13:59.040
You got choppers?
With snipers and rockets?

13:59.074 --> 14:00.875
No one has
rocket choppers.

14:00.876 --> 14:04.746
Although that does
sound amazing.

14:04.780 --> 14:06.347
So, what'd I miss?

14:06.348 --> 14:09.217
Tell me all the jokes.
Everything funny that happened.

14:09.251 --> 14:11.619
Charles, we really
need to get back to...

14:11.620 --> 14:13.521
Hitchcock called himself
Scully by accident.

14:13.522 --> 14:16.891
I did. But it brought
me and Scully closer together.

14:16.892 --> 14:18.226
<i>That's great!</i>

14:18.260 --> 14:19.260
What else?

14:19.261 --> 14:20.495
Oh...

14:20.496 --> 14:23.531
Oh, I laughed too hard.
Lost another highlighter.

14:23.532 --> 14:25.233
Does anyone have
skinny forearms?

14:25.267 --> 14:26.400
Fine.

14:26.435 --> 14:29.403
Great.

14:31.406 --> 14:33.608
Yeah, it's way
down there by my butt.

14:33.609 --> 14:34.609
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

14:34.610 --> 14:35.943
Is that it?
Yup.

14:35.944 --> 14:36.911
Oh, okay. <i> Right there.</i>

14:36.945 --> 14:38.279
Ah!

14:38.280 --> 14:39.947
Got it.

14:39.982 --> 14:42.650
Oh, my God.
Where's my grandmother's ring?

14:42.651 --> 14:44.752
Oop. Found it.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.754
I'll be right back.

14:46.755 --> 14:48.790
Please get
out of my way. I am physically disabled.

14:48.791 --> 14:50.348
Please get out of my way.

14:52.261 --> 14:53.928
Welcome to
the Boyle-free zone.

14:53.929 --> 14:56.430
<i>Please turn off
all cell phones</i>

14:56.465 --> 14:59.734
so as not to attract
any unwanted attention.

14:59.735 --> 15:01.402
Can I offer you a mint?

15:01.403 --> 15:04.272
<i>We got eyes on the bandit.
He's a block away.</i>

15:04.273 --> 15:05.940
You ready?

15:05.941 --> 15:07.809
You and me, Jakey.
We were born ready.

15:07.843 --> 15:09.243
Go, Judy, go.

15:14.316 --> 15:16.317
<i>We meet at last,
Pontiac bandit.</i>

15:16.351 --> 15:19.453
For eight years
I've tracked you.

15:19.454 --> 15:22.690
And today I'm taking you down.

15:22.691 --> 15:23.772
Doug Judy, can you hear me?

15:23.792 --> 15:25.426
Say something
to test the wire.

15:25.427 --> 15:26.494
<i>Hey, Diaz...</i>

15:26.528 --> 15:28.496
After we put the cuffs
on this guy,

15:28.530 --> 15:30.164
I'll be free for dinner.

15:30.165 --> 15:31.666
You like spaghetti?

15:31.667 --> 15:34.135
And weed?

15:34.169 --> 15:35.803
The mic works.

15:35.804 --> 15:37.471
My man. What's up?

15:37.506 --> 15:38.806
<i>Pleasure to see you again.</i>

15:38.841 --> 15:40.174
<i>Let's talk about cars.</i>

15:40.209 --> 15:41.809
<i>I got my shop
up and running again.</i>

15:41.844 --> 15:43.811
<i>I can do anything you want.</i>

15:43.812 --> 15:47.181
<i>Blue cars, red cars,
big cars, small cars,</i>

15:47.216 --> 15:49.684
<i>you know, cars. Cars are
really great, aren't they?</i>

15:49.685 --> 15:50.684
What is he doing?

15:50.686 --> 15:54.055
Talking about cars.

15:57.392 --> 15:59.794
Boyle, where is everyone?

15:59.795 --> 16:01.128
Hiding from me
in the evidence room.

16:01.163 --> 16:02.530
They think I don't know,

16:02.564 --> 16:04.031
but Gina's been live
tweeting the whole thing.

16:04.066 --> 16:06.033
She live tweets
everything.

16:06.034 --> 16:07.168
Ruined <i>Downton Abbey</i> for me.

16:07.202 --> 16:09.303
Maybe it was too soon
for me to come back.

16:09.338 --> 16:10.838
I would've just
stayed at home,

16:10.839 --> 16:12.173
but I was getting
lonely and bored.

16:12.174 --> 16:14.575
One day I looked
out the window for four hours.

16:14.576 --> 16:16.978
I didn't see anything.

16:16.979 --> 16:18.512
Huh.

16:18.513 --> 16:20.181
<i>You know what
else is great about cars?</i>

16:20.215 --> 16:23.017
<i>The way they look.
How they stop, how they start.</i>

16:23.051 --> 16:24.485
That's it. I'm calling it.

16:24.519 --> 16:25.519
No!

16:25.520 --> 16:26.854
Move, people,
we're going in now.

16:32.661 --> 16:35.663
On your knees!
Hands on your head!

16:35.697 --> 16:37.398
Gotcha, Pontiac bandit.

16:37.432 --> 16:38.799
Where's Doug Judy?

16:38.800 --> 16:41.335
He went to the bathroom.

16:41.370 --> 16:42.370
I'm just here
to give him a haircut.

16:42.371 --> 16:43.371
I don't know
what's going on.

16:43.372 --> 16:44.739
A likely story, Pontiac...

16:44.740 --> 16:46.974
But actually you do have
a lot of hair products.

16:47.009 --> 16:48.109
He's gone. He ran.

16:48.110 --> 16:49.477
Why would he do that?

16:49.511 --> 16:51.579
He helped us catch the Pontiac
bandit. That was the deal.

16:51.580 --> 16:53.047
Doesn't make
any sense unless...

16:53.048 --> 16:54.682
Doug Judy is
the Pontiac bandit.

16:56.118 --> 16:57.251
Put out an APB.

16:57.286 --> 16:59.253
Seal off everything
for a 20-block radius.

16:59.254 --> 17:00.888
<i>Yeah,
don't bother looking for me.</i>

17:00.889 --> 17:02.690
I'm in the wind.

17:02.691 --> 17:04.191
<i>If you're close
enough for me to hear you,</i>

17:04.192 --> 17:05.893
you're close enough
for me to catch you.

17:05.928 --> 17:07.929
Nah, I got a relay
set up, brother.

17:07.963 --> 17:10.998
So if you're the Pontiac bandit,
who's this joker?

17:10.999 --> 17:13.000
<i>Couple of years ago
you were getting really close,</i>

17:13.035 --> 17:14.669
so I started telling
all my associates

17:14.670 --> 17:17.371
if they ever get caught,
they should describe me as...

17:17.406 --> 17:19.973
Asian dude, 5'8",
spiky hair.

17:19.974 --> 17:21.242
Wears diamond earrings
and has a...

17:21.276 --> 17:22.676
British accent.

17:22.678 --> 17:24.545
So then you hired a guy who
matched that exact description.

17:24.546 --> 17:25.880
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

17:25.914 --> 17:28.683
That's my barber Norman Lee.
He gave me the idea.

17:28.684 --> 17:30.685
You know, if you can't come in,
I do house calls.

17:30.719 --> 17:31.986
You just text me a location

17:31.987 --> 17:34.288
and I could be there
in half an hour.

17:34.289 --> 17:35.890
Good to know.

17:35.891 --> 17:37.825
You know, you should actually
use him while he's there.

17:37.826 --> 17:39.393
He'll give you a dope fade.

17:39.394 --> 17:42.029
I get dope enough fades from
my current barber, thank you.

17:42.030 --> 17:43.597
So you dragged us over here,
went in there,

17:43.598 --> 17:44.632
pretended to talk, and then
snuck out the basement.

17:44.633 --> 17:46.100
Am I right?

17:46.101 --> 17:48.469
<i>The basement connected
to another basement!</i>

17:48.503 --> 17:50.371
Which connected to a garage,

17:50.372 --> 17:51.739
which is where
my boy picked me up.

17:51.740 --> 17:54.108
Your boy?

17:54.142 --> 17:55.142
Oh, that guy from the meet-up.

17:55.177 --> 17:56.610
<i>He works for you.</i>

17:56.611 --> 17:58.279
He pretended to be spooked
by me and Diaz

17:58.313 --> 17:59.847
in the parking lot
to make sure that

17:59.848 --> 18:01.415
we let you go to
the next meeting by yourself.

18:01.450 --> 18:03.184
Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding!

18:03.185 --> 18:04.552
You win a Teddy bear!

18:04.586 --> 18:06.320
You lied to me, Doug Judy.

18:06.321 --> 18:08.990
Gotta be honest, I'm pretty
disappointed right now.

18:08.991 --> 18:10.558
I mean, was that even
really your mom?

18:10.559 --> 18:11.892
<i>Hell yeah, that's my real mom.</i>

18:11.927 --> 18:15.196
I wanted to see her one last
time before I disappeared.

18:15.197 --> 18:16.998
I told you I was sensitive,
Rosa.

18:16.999 --> 18:18.332
<i>Yeah, you did.</i>

18:18.367 --> 18:20.434
Why don't you come back here
and take me out to dinner?

18:20.435 --> 18:22.470
Ah...

18:22.471 --> 18:24.038
I know you're
trying to trap me.

18:24.039 --> 18:26.640
But crazy thing is
I'm tempted!

18:26.641 --> 18:27.975
That's how hot I find you.

18:28.010 --> 18:30.177
<i>Sorry it had to go down
this way, Peralta.</i>

18:30.178 --> 18:32.313
<i>Maybe we could've been
friends in another world.</i>

18:32.314 --> 18:33.514
<i>If I hadn't just fooled you</i>

18:33.548 --> 18:34.982
like a little bitch!

18:36.651 --> 18:39.587
Bitch!

18:39.588 --> 18:41.299
'Kay.

18:46.057 --> 18:47.424
Hey, Captain,
we thought we'd

18:47.425 --> 18:48.792
get more work done
in here, because...

18:48.793 --> 18:50.460
You're all hiding
from Boyle.

18:50.461 --> 18:51.561
<i>Not me, Captain.</i>

18:51.595 --> 18:52.595
I was napping.

18:52.596 --> 18:53.997
That's worse.

18:53.998 --> 18:55.398
<i>Captain,
we all think Boyle's a hero,</i>

18:55.399 --> 18:58.234
but it's very difficult
to be around him right now.

18:58.235 --> 18:59.903
<i>I was in
the bathroom with him, sir.</i>

18:59.904 --> 19:01.604
It was a nightmare.

19:01.605 --> 19:02.772
Hey, sarge,

19:02.773 --> 19:04.541
this cast has a special
crotch hole.

19:04.542 --> 19:06.810
It's like a doggy door
for my penis.

19:06.811 --> 19:09.112
Shake.

19:10.147 --> 19:12.549
That man took a bullet
for this precinct.

19:12.550 --> 19:15.485
He's a guy who's always
looking for love and friendship.

19:15.519 --> 19:17.721
And he needs it now
more than ever.

19:17.755 --> 19:19.589
But you all turned
your backs on him.

19:19.623 --> 19:22.659
And you should all be
ashamed of yourselves.

19:24.095 --> 19:27.097
I'm sorry.
Those puppies are so cute.

19:27.098 --> 19:29.399
They do undercut
your Tone a bit, sir.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.634
<i>But on the plus side,</i>

19:31.635 --> 19:34.070
I think I know
what to do with them.

19:34.071 --> 19:36.906
<i>Detective Boyle.</i>

19:36.907 --> 19:41.444
I think you might be able to
give these dogs a good home.

19:41.445 --> 19:43.146
Ah...

19:43.147 --> 19:44.347
You are off the scooter.

19:44.348 --> 19:46.316
If you have fallen,
please call a doctor.

19:46.317 --> 19:47.884
Oh, Captain...

19:47.885 --> 19:49.285
I don't know
if I should... okay.

19:49.320 --> 19:50.720
Oh...

19:50.755 --> 19:53.757
That tickles.

19:53.758 --> 19:57.293
They like me so much!

19:58.629 --> 19:59.763
Are you crying, Santiago?

19:59.797 --> 20:01.898
I'm so allergic.

20:01.899 --> 20:04.134
Can you tell the scooter
to call an ambulance?

20:05.770 --> 20:07.237
Hey.

20:07.271 --> 20:08.538
So...

20:08.572 --> 20:10.240
I went back to
the mom's house.

20:10.241 --> 20:12.342
Unsurprisingly a dead end.

20:12.343 --> 20:14.210
I got a lot of work
to do, Peralta.

20:14.211 --> 20:15.211
<i>Wait.</i>

20:15.212 --> 20:16.513
<i>I want to say something.</i>

20:16.514 --> 20:18.047
We've worked together
long enough that I know

20:18.048 --> 20:19.516
how much you hate apologies.

20:19.517 --> 20:22.118
I just want to ask you
to join the Doug Judy case.

20:22.119 --> 20:23.953
Officially, as partners.

20:23.954 --> 20:27.490
I want to catch this guy,
and I can't do it without you.

20:27.491 --> 20:30.226
No, you can't.

20:30.227 --> 20:31.995
Now I bee I owe you
1,000 push-ups.

20:31.996 --> 20:33.663
I don't care about
the push-ups, Jake.

20:33.697 --> 20:35.131
I care that you
didn't honor our pact.

20:35.132 --> 20:36.566
I've always trusted you,

20:36.567 --> 20:37.901
and when you did that it made me
feel like you don't trust me.

20:37.935 --> 20:39.836
I know, and I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

20:39.837 --> 20:40.970
No, it won't.

20:41.005 --> 20:42.772
Now get down on the floor.

20:42.807 --> 20:44.641
What? You just said you didn't
care about the push-ups.

20:44.675 --> 20:46.509
I changed my mind.

20:46.544 --> 20:48.344
Fair enough.

20:49.513 --> 20:51.781
A pact's a pact.

20:54.418 --> 20:57.420
One, two, three...

20:57.421 --> 20:59.289
612...

20:59.290 --> 21:00.557
Night, Peralta.

21:00.558 --> 21:04.294
Night.

21:04.295 --> 21:07.397
613...

21:07.398 --> 21:08.865
Hey, Ronald.

21:12.803 --> 21:15.371
1,000...

21:15.406 --> 21:18.508
Is so many push-ups.
I'm never gonna make it.

21:18.542 --> 21:19.876
What am I at?

21:19.877 --> 21:21.144
901.

21:21.178 --> 21:22.979
Thank you, Captain.

21:22.980 --> 21:24.347
You said 2,000, remember?

21:24.348 --> 21:25.348
<i>Agh!</i>

21:25.349 --> 21:27.884
I shoulda trusted you!
