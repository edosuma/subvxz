00:16.071 --> 00:18.106
Separatist takeover complete.

00:18.173 --> 00:20.675
Another Republic planet has fallen.

00:20.743 --> 00:22.010
Onderon has seceded

00:22.077 --> 00:24.612
to the Confederacy
of Independent Systems

00:24.680 --> 00:26.881
under the rule of a new king.

00:26.949 --> 00:29.717
However, a small band of rebels
have taken refuge

00:29.785 --> 00:32.953
deep within its vast
and savage wilderness.

00:33.021 --> 00:35.690
From an abandoned outpost,
they plot to take back

00:35.757 --> 00:38.159
the heavily fortified
capital city of Iziz

00:38.227 --> 00:40.895
and end the Separatist occupation.

00:44.033 --> 00:46.601
Unfortunately,
the only way to reclaim Onderon

00:46.669 --> 00:48.436
will be through armed struggle.

00:48.504 --> 00:51.006
But we lack sufficient
hardware and supplies.

00:51.073 --> 00:53.007
Onderon is in your king's rule.

00:53.075 --> 00:55.343
And at the outbreak of the Clone War,

00:55.411 --> 00:57.613
he chose to align it
with the Separatists.

00:57.680 --> 00:59.648
Our true king has been silenced.

00:59.715 --> 01:01.349
The one you recognize is a traitor

01:01.417 --> 01:03.652
and a Separatist minion.

01:03.719 --> 01:05.720
We need your help to survive this.

01:05.788 --> 01:09.157
Find a way we shall.

01:09.225 --> 01:11.193
We await your answer.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.434
There are pockets of rebels
on many of these planets

01:18.502 --> 01:19.936
that just need guidance.

01:20.004 --> 01:22.705
With training and resources,

01:22.773 --> 01:24.741
they could attack soft targets
while the Republic

01:24.809 --> 01:26.976
continues to engage them
on the battlefield.

01:27.044 --> 01:29.679
That sounds like terrorism, Anakin.

01:29.746 --> 01:31.347
Well, I think of it as an insurgency

01:31.415 --> 01:34.350
to help realign these planets
with the Republic.

01:34.417 --> 01:36.352
We can divide the Separatist forces

01:36.420 --> 01:38.955
and press them on two fronts.

01:39.022 --> 01:42.391
A means to an end fear cannot be.

01:42.459 --> 01:46.495
Stop those who spread terror
the Jedi must.

01:46.563 --> 01:47.496
Indeed.

01:47.564 --> 01:48.764
What you're suggesting

01:48.832 --> 01:50.533
would open up dangerous possibilities.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.702
And we must not train terrorists.

01:52.770 --> 01:54.337
Eh, rebels.

01:54.404 --> 01:55.571
How we conduct war

01:55.639 --> 01:58.041
is what distinguishes us from others.

01:58.108 --> 02:00.410
Funding rebels to overthrow
a legitimate government

02:00.477 --> 02:02.345
puts innocent lives at risk.

02:02.413 --> 02:03.847
We can minimize collateral damage

02:03.914 --> 02:06.383
by using arms
that mainly affect droids.

02:06.450 --> 02:09.219
The least we can do
is help them defend themselves,

02:09.286 --> 02:11.454
test the tactic while we're at it.

02:12.723 --> 02:14.758
This could be
a great new weapon for us.

02:18.629 --> 02:19.930
Hmm.

02:19.998 --> 02:22.132
Train and observe.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.368
Send advisors we will.

02:24.436 --> 02:25.969
I'll assemble a team.

02:26.037 --> 02:28.238
I'm going with you.

02:28.306 --> 02:30.341
What, you don't trust me?

02:30.408 --> 02:31.609
Too much.

02:31.677 --> 02:33.678
That's what worries me.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:47.290 --> 02:49.225
This is Valkyrie 2929.

02:49.292 --> 02:50.893
We're coming up on the drop zone.

02:56.866 --> 02:58.867
Go, go, go, go!

03:23.928 --> 03:25.929
We've spotted them, sir.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.109
Stay where you are.

03:42.615 --> 03:44.582
Identify yourselves.

03:47.787 --> 03:50.122
It's all right.
We're friends.

03:50.189 --> 03:51.923
Jedi.

03:55.561 --> 03:57.128
I'm Commander Tano.

03:57.196 --> 03:59.497
We're here to help you
take back your planet.

03:59.565 --> 04:01.633
My name is Steela.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.369
I'll guide you to our secret base.

05:14.570 --> 05:15.837
Hmm.

05:15.905 --> 05:18.639
A bit rough around the edges,
wouldn't you say?

05:18.707 --> 05:20.441
That's why I brought Rex here.

05:20.509 --> 05:22.543
They're not exactly
what I would call shinies, sir,

05:22.611 --> 05:24.612
but I could work with them.

05:43.865 --> 05:45.265
General Skywalker.

05:45.333 --> 05:46.966
At your service.

05:47.034 --> 05:48.768
This is General Kenobi,

05:48.836 --> 05:51.538
Commander Tano, and Captain Rex.

05:51.606 --> 05:53.474
We're looking forward
to taking the fight

05:53.541 --> 05:55.342
to those scrappin' droids.

05:55.410 --> 05:58.245
Yes.
All in good time.

05:58.313 --> 05:59.580
Saw.

05:59.648 --> 06:01.115
Saw Gerrera.

06:01.183 --> 06:03.251
He fashions himself as our leader,

06:03.319 --> 06:06.421
though no one elected him.

06:06.489 --> 06:08.591
Well, for now, we're in charge,

06:08.658 --> 06:10.626
and there is much to learn.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.268
The Separatists
have strength in numbers.

06:18.335 --> 06:21.404
We're gonna show you
how to target and destroy them.

06:21.472 --> 06:22.439
Now, to be clear,

06:22.506 --> 06:24.441
we are not here to fight your war;

06:24.509 --> 06:26.243
rather, to show you how to conduct it

06:26.311 --> 06:29.279
in the most efficient
and successful way possible.

06:32.050 --> 06:34.317
Captain Rex.

06:34.385 --> 06:38.088
I'll show you
how the 501st destroy clankers.

06:38.156 --> 06:40.157
First, I need volunteers
to carry supplies

06:40.225 --> 06:42.927
from our entry point
a half-klick west.

06:42.995 --> 06:44.796
Shouldn't be a problem.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.197
Excellent.

06:48.501 --> 06:51.703
Lux, it's good to see you again.

06:51.771 --> 06:53.906
It's good to see you too, Ahsoka.

06:53.974 --> 06:57.010
I didn't realize you had
such strong ties to Onderon.

06:57.077 --> 06:58.778
Onderon is my home.

06:58.845 --> 07:01.247
My mother represented it
in the Senate.

07:01.315 --> 07:04.917
Your voice is strong, like hers was.

07:04.985 --> 07:07.954
Have you reconsidered
joining the Republic Senate?

07:08.021 --> 07:10.223
Even if we do take back Onderon,

07:10.290 --> 07:12.124
it won't change how I feel.

07:12.192 --> 07:14.093
I'm not fighting for the Republic.

07:14.160 --> 07:16.562
Well, what matters now is,
we need each other's help,

07:16.630 --> 07:18.764
just like we did on Carlac.

07:18.832 --> 07:20.732
Carlac?

07:20.800 --> 07:23.402
What happened on Carlac?

07:23.469 --> 07:27.005
Ahsoka is the reason I'm here
and not with Death Watch.

07:27.073 --> 07:28.506
Really?

07:28.574 --> 07:30.074
What he means is--

07:30.142 --> 07:32.844
- She saved me from a huge mistake.

07:36.515 --> 07:37.615
Hmm.

07:37.682 --> 07:39.950
Lux obviously thinks highly of you.

07:40.018 --> 07:41.151
I guess so.

07:41.219 --> 07:44.255
Let's hope that respect
is well founded.

07:49.460 --> 07:51.780
The pilot in the front hatch
controls the tank,

07:51.900 --> 07:54.236
the shelves and the short range blasters.

07:54.356 --> 07:56.091
The commander in the top hatch
controls the turret

07:56.158 --> 07:57.892
and the main cannon.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.761
You have to take out both chambers.

07:59.829 --> 08:02.664
Otherwise, the tank
will remain operational.

08:18.882 --> 08:20.883
Everyone, divide up into teams of two,

08:20.951 --> 08:24.120
and we'll practice an assault
on both hatches.

08:25.523 --> 08:26.723
I'll take the top.

08:26.791 --> 08:29.860
Let's see what you're
made of, Bonteri.

08:39.169 --> 08:41.138
Ah!

08:43.307 --> 08:45.508
Sorry about that.

08:45.576 --> 08:48.545
You're a terrible soldier, Bonteri.

08:48.613 --> 08:50.714
I'm not sure
if they're more interested

08:50.782 --> 08:52.783
in fighting the droids or each other.

08:52.850 --> 08:54.017
They'll learn.

08:54.085 --> 08:56.353
We just need time
to train them properly.

08:56.421 --> 08:58.321
Keep your eyes on the quick learners.

08:58.389 --> 09:01.057
In this fight,
time is not on our side.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.960
Go, go, go, go, go!

09:27.886 --> 09:29.854
An unscheduled ship
entered the atmosphere

09:29.921 --> 09:31.088
in sector S-11

09:31.156 --> 09:33.190
and failed to register.

09:33.258 --> 09:36.193
The rebels may be operating
in that area.

09:36.261 --> 09:38.262
Check it out.

09:44.235 --> 09:45.368
Come on!

09:45.436 --> 09:48.404
Move it like a soldier,
like a real soldier!

09:48.472 --> 09:50.340
Come on, Dono.
Pick it up, Hutch.

09:50.407 --> 09:51.874
You can do better than that.

09:51.942 --> 09:53.309
Come on, hustle!

09:53.377 --> 09:54.877
I said hustle!

09:54.945 --> 09:56.546
That's what I'm talking about
right there.

09:56.613 --> 09:57.780
Go, go, go!

09:57.848 --> 09:58.848
Good, good.

09:58.916 --> 10:00.083
You sure you're up for this?

10:00.151 --> 10:01.985
- Saw.
- It was an accident.

10:02.053 --> 10:05.856
You would've had us both killed.

10:05.924 --> 10:08.225
Just stop it.

10:08.293 --> 10:09.693
Sit down, boy.

10:09.761 --> 10:11.028
This isn't the Senate.

10:11.096 --> 10:12.930
You've got no talent for this.

10:12.998 --> 10:14.599
It's going to take
a lot more than muscle

10:14.667 --> 10:16.567
to defeat the Separatists.

10:16.635 --> 10:19.903
Politics have failed us.
We have no choice.

10:19.971 --> 10:21.838
We always have a choice.

10:21.906 --> 10:24.241
Then make yours.

10:24.309 --> 10:26.143
Look, if we're going to succeed,

10:26.211 --> 10:29.347
you'll need to be exceptional
with words and action.

10:29.414 --> 10:31.382
There will be time for both.

10:38.056 --> 10:40.391
Destroyers are quick,
pack twin blasters,

10:40.459 --> 10:42.292
and come with their own
shield generators.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.262
Nothing short of a cannon
will pierce it.

10:45.330 --> 10:47.631
But they do have two weaknesses,

10:47.699 --> 10:50.768
and you will need to work
together to exploit them.

10:52.037 --> 10:54.072
Beep!

10:54.139 --> 10:56.574
The shields deflect
high-velocity attacks.

11:01.313 --> 11:05.283
What the shields don't stop
are slow or stationary objects.

11:05.350 --> 11:06.517
They're designed to absorb them

11:06.585 --> 11:09.320
so nothing hinders their movement.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.762
Destroyers are blind from behind.

11:18.830 --> 11:21.031
A distraction combined
with a rear assault

11:21.099 --> 11:22.532
will give you a kill.

11:22.600 --> 11:25.602
The trick is to get the right
speed on the droid popper.

11:25.670 --> 11:27.671
Beep!

11:28.740 --> 11:29.907
These are unarmed.

11:29.975 --> 11:33.211
Just concentrate on getting it
past the shield.

11:34.313 --> 11:36.314
Watch and learn.

11:41.386 --> 11:43.354
Quite brilliant.

11:54.300 --> 11:56.001
Hmm.
Nice touch.

11:56.068 --> 11:58.070
Thanks.

12:00.006 --> 12:01.974
Not bad.

12:10.650 --> 12:12.785
Ugh!

12:12.853 --> 12:14.854
Be mindful of your frustration.

12:14.922 --> 12:16.722
It'll only hold you back.

12:16.790 --> 12:17.924
Here.

12:17.991 --> 12:20.126
Use your shoulder, let your arm swing,

12:20.193 --> 12:22.828
and keep your eyes on the target.

12:25.165 --> 12:26.933
Great.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.668
Okay, let's get back to work.

12:28.735 --> 12:30.069
Everyone pair up.

12:30.137 --> 12:32.105
We'll practice in groups.

12:37.144 --> 12:40.913
Hey, Commander,
how about helping me practice?

12:59.265 --> 13:02.467
Roger, roger.
This is command.

13:02.535 --> 13:07.172
Copy that.
I'll send a squad out now.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.641
We've located the rebels.

13:08.708 --> 13:11.010
Proceed to sector S-29.

13:11.077 --> 13:13.045
Shoot to kill.

13:36.423 --> 13:38.724
I can't get the distance
or the speed right.

13:38.792 --> 13:40.193
Don't give up.

13:40.260 --> 13:44.397
Learning this could save your
life and those around you.

13:44.465 --> 13:48.168
A little backspin might help.

13:48.235 --> 13:49.803
Just take it easy.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.872
Don't get frustrated.

13:59.014 --> 14:00.048
You got it.

14:00.115 --> 14:02.250
You're a good teacher, Jedi.

14:02.318 --> 14:03.886
Ugh, just forget it.

14:03.953 --> 14:05.921
I'll never learn this.

14:09.026 --> 14:11.261
Uh, keep practicing.

14:22.707 --> 14:24.174
You made it look easy.

14:24.242 --> 14:26.710
It wasn't always that way.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.345
Right.
The Force.

14:28.413 --> 14:29.446
That your secret?

14:29.514 --> 14:32.616
No.
Perseverance.

14:32.684 --> 14:34.485
Look, you'll get the hang of it.

14:34.552 --> 14:36.219
I wouldn't let it get you down.

14:36.287 --> 14:39.556
I'm not feeling down.

14:39.623 --> 14:41.625
I just know what I'm good at.

14:59.210 --> 15:01.112
Impressive.

15:01.179 --> 15:03.214
Most impressive.

15:03.282 --> 15:04.983
Fixed targets are one thing.

15:05.050 --> 15:07.051
How about this?

15:16.696 --> 15:18.664
Nice job.

15:21.435 --> 15:24.704
You have clearly mastered
your ability to focus.

15:27.441 --> 15:29.777
Snips, are you losing focus?

15:29.844 --> 15:32.179
- No, Master.
- Good.

15:32.246 --> 15:33.380
A headshot

15:33.448 --> 15:36.283
is the only decisive way
to disable a droid.

15:36.351 --> 15:38.251
They don't need arms, legs,
or even bodies

15:38.319 --> 15:40.720
to pass intel to central command.

15:40.788 --> 15:42.789
All right, shoot at will.

15:45.893 --> 15:48.228
Wait a minute.
What is that?

15:50.165 --> 15:51.532
Droids!

15:55.337 --> 15:56.337
Take cover!

16:08.384 --> 16:10.518
It appears the training is over.

16:21.664 --> 16:23.932
I'll take the left flank
if you take the right.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.968
No, Anakin.
We can only protect them.

16:27.036 --> 16:29.270
We cannot fight this war for them.

16:33.441 --> 16:34.675
There are too many.

16:34.743 --> 16:36.978
But Anakin, Ahsoka, and I
can hold them off

16:37.045 --> 16:38.712
while you get your people out of here.

16:40.982 --> 16:42.883
You didn't teach us to run.

16:42.950 --> 16:45.552
Saw, use your disruptors
to take out the droids.

16:45.620 --> 16:46.820
I'm on it.

16:46.888 --> 16:47.988
Ready disruptors.

16:48.056 --> 16:50.657
On my mark.

16:50.725 --> 16:53.293
Now!

16:53.361 --> 16:55.629
What is that?

16:55.696 --> 16:57.131
It looks like an explosive.

16:57.198 --> 16:58.132
How can you te--

16:59.601 --> 17:00.601
Not bad.

17:00.669 --> 17:02.803
That is only the first wave.

17:15.183 --> 17:16.349
We'll handle this.

17:16.417 --> 17:18.452
No, I will.

17:18.520 --> 17:19.753
Duck!

17:35.772 --> 17:37.773
Ah!

17:39.809 --> 17:42.844
Hey, Bonteri, you ready to try again?

17:45.315 --> 17:46.681
Hey, what are you doing?

17:46.749 --> 17:48.783
What you taught us.

17:53.389 --> 17:54.989
Clang!

17:55.057 --> 17:56.991
Surrender, rebel.
Uh...

17:57.059 --> 18:01.829
You will answer for your crimes
against the Separatist Alliance.

18:16.243 --> 18:18.177
We, uh, need to clean you up.

18:18.245 --> 18:19.812
I like it.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.682
Now you look more like a soldier
than a politician.

18:22.750 --> 18:26.586
Well, maybe a good politician
needs to get dirty now and then.

18:34.194 --> 18:36.161
Take confidence from this victory.

18:36.229 --> 18:39.498
But rest assured,
there will be more droids coming

18:39.565 --> 18:41.600
now that they know your position.

18:41.668 --> 18:44.002
It doesn't matter.
You're ready now.

18:44.070 --> 18:46.638
We are going to take the fight
to the droids.

18:46.706 --> 18:48.974
You don't have to hide
in the jungle any longer.

18:49.041 --> 18:52.510
Droids were a bit dim,
more so than I imagined.

18:52.578 --> 18:54.479
They make up for it in numbers.

18:54.547 --> 18:56.214
They're designed to overwhelm.

18:56.282 --> 18:59.417
But they're not designed
to deal with our approach.

18:59.485 --> 19:01.519
We hit them
where they least expect it.

19:01.587 --> 19:03.187
And before they realize
what happened--

19:03.255 --> 19:05.457
We fade in
with the rest of the population.

19:05.524 --> 19:07.092
Exactly.

19:07.160 --> 19:09.928
We need a plan to get inside the city.

19:09.996 --> 19:12.598
I have an idea.

19:36.989 --> 19:38.991
Identification please.

19:45.565 --> 19:46.798
Halt.

19:46.866 --> 19:50.302
What were you doing
outside of the city gates?

19:50.369 --> 19:51.303
Hunting.

19:51.370 --> 19:53.038
We've been trekking for days.

19:53.105 --> 19:57.976
Did you register
before your excursion?

19:58.044 --> 20:00.378
No, but most of our time
is spent in the bush,

20:00.446 --> 20:01.980
collecting our traps.

20:02.048 --> 20:04.249
We come to the city to sell.

20:04.317 --> 20:07.352
You can't get thrip larva
like this in Iziz.

20:07.420 --> 20:10.088
Only the biggest trees
on the other side of Onderon.

20:10.156 --> 20:11.456
Hey, listen,

20:11.524 --> 20:14.226
we need to deliver all of this
in time for supper.

20:14.293 --> 20:15.393
Hmm.

20:15.461 --> 20:16.995
Are you scanning anything?

20:17.063 --> 20:21.099
It's hard to tell
with so much organic matter.

20:21.167 --> 20:22.200
Come on!

20:22.268 --> 20:24.102
Our merchants are waiting inside.

20:24.169 --> 20:26.604
Can you hurry it up?

20:26.672 --> 20:28.339
Let them through.

20:28.407 --> 20:30.408
Roger, roger.

20:39.585 --> 20:40.886
Good plan.

20:40.953 --> 20:42.054
Like Saw said,

20:42.121 --> 20:44.757
those droids are dumber
than we thought.

20:53.133 --> 20:54.300
Not a bad start.

20:54.368 --> 20:57.103
But now the hard work begins.

20:57.171 --> 21:00.239
You must find recruits
and choose your targets wisely.

21:00.307 --> 21:02.175
They'll be looking for us.

21:02.243 --> 21:03.677
We should split up.

21:03.745 --> 21:04.945
Regroup after nightfall.

21:05.013 --> 21:06.980
I'll alert our brothers.

21:10.184 --> 21:12.419
We'll make sure you have
the supplies you need.

21:12.486 --> 21:15.488
Rex and I will take care of that.

21:15.555 --> 21:16.622
Good luck.

21:16.690 --> 21:18.691
You too.

21:31.471 --> 21:34.373
How do you think they'll do?

21:34.441 --> 21:37.843
I have a feeling
we'll be pleasantly surprised.

21:37.911 --> 21:40.679
So you admit our new strategy
will work?

21:40.747 --> 21:44.517
I am hopeful, Anakin, hopeful.
