04:31.064 --> 04:32.827
I'm glad to see you.

04:42.307 --> 04:43.147
Please.

04:43.571 --> 04:51.571
THE TWINS

05:11.234 --> 05:13.395
Last will and testament of
Dr. Nawal Marwan.

05:13.537 --> 05:16.836
Opening of the will to
her two children,

05:16.940 --> 05:20.899
Simon Marwan and Jeanne Marwan.

05:22.379 --> 05:24.346
"In accordance with the will,

05:24.446 --> 05:28.348
regulations and rights of
Nawal Marwan,

05:28.450 --> 05:30.418
the notary, Jean Lebel,

05:30.553 --> 05:33.613
is named executor."

05:33.756 --> 05:35.883
Hmm ... I must tell you here

05:36.058 --> 05:38.855
that it was your mother's decision.

05:38.960 --> 05:43.260
I was personally against
it, but she insisted.

05:45.466 --> 05:46.558
You know ...

05:48.203 --> 05:50.728
...your mother was more
than an employee.

05:50.905 --> 05:52.202
To my late wife and me

05:52.306 --> 05:55.605
you felt more like part
of our family, so ...

05:56.610 --> 05:58.134
I could not refuse.

06:00.581 --> 06:03.880
Hum!
"All my assets are to be
shared between the twins,

06:03.984 --> 06:05.281
Jeanne and Simon Marwan."

06:05.419 --> 06:07.648
"The money is to be equitably
shared"

06:07.787 --> 06:11.086
"My furniture distributed by
mutual agreement."

06:12.491 --> 06:13.753
"Burial"

06:14.927 --> 06:17.157
"Notary Jean Lebel will

06:17.296 --> 06:20.561
bury me without a coffin, naked

06:20.666 --> 06:21.893
and without prayers."

06:22.000 --> 06:26.061
"My face turned towards the ground,
my back against the world."

06:28.940 --> 06:31.737
"Tombstone and Epitaph"

06:31.743 --> 06:33.768
"No headstone is to be
placed on my grave

06:33.912 --> 06:35.277
and my name engraved nowhere."

06:35.413 --> 06:38.677
"No epitaph is deserved for those
who do not keep their promises."

06:40.684 --> 06:43.084
"To Jeanne and Simon"

06:43.187 --> 06:46.486
"Childhood is like a knife
stuck in the throat

06:46.624 --> 06:48.956
which cannot be removed easily."

06:51.861 --> 06:55.695
"Jeanne, notary Lebel will
hand you an envelope."

06:57.333 --> 07:00.962
"This envelope is for your father."

07:02.105 --> 07:03.936
"Find him

07:04.040 --> 07:05.871
and hand him the envelope."

07:08.844 --> 07:11.677
"Simon, the notary will
hand you an envelope."

07:11.813 --> 07:13.303
I've heard enough.

07:15.484 --> 07:18.453
Oh ... but it's not finished.

07:20.888 --> 07:22.378
Continue.

07:23.991 --> 07:27.017
"Simon, the notary will
hand you an envelope."

07:27.161 --> 07:30.130
"This envelope is for your brother."

07:31.499 --> 07:34.900
"Find him and hand it to him."

07:39.239 --> 07:42.174
"When these envelopes
have been handed

07:42.342 --> 07:46.005
to their addressees, a
letter will be given to you."

07:46.179 --> 07:49.080
"When the silence is broken,
and the promise kept

07:49.215 --> 07:52.377
a stone may be placed
on my grave

07:52.518 --> 07:55.578
and my name engraved on
the stone."

08:10.668 --> 08:12.568
I admit it's a bit strange.

08:19.876 --> 08:21.935
Is there stuff to sign?

08:22.079 --> 08:24.206
No, not today.

08:24.348 --> 08:25.576
OK.

08:26.583 --> 08:28.210
Thank you, Jean.

08:28.385 --> 08:29.875
- Shall we?
- Wait.

08:33.690 --> 08:36.419
You know, the history
of our father.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.857
You know, we have no brother.

08:38.961 --> 08:41.293
Why did you let her write this?

08:42.698 --> 08:44.757
I understand your surprise.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.130
It's ... it's very surprising.

08:47.269 --> 08:48.236
Stop pretending to be innocent!

08:48.404 --> 08:50.928
We know that we speak of, there is
nothing surprising in this.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.302
We did not make these
things up, Simon...

08:53.441 --> 08:54.738
They are part of a will.

08:55.877 --> 08:57.401
There's that, too.

09:13.627 --> 09:18.087
Well, this morning your mother
gave us something rather special.

09:18.232 --> 09:20.791
We'll sleep on it, then ...

09:20.933 --> 09:22.798
We'll meet again, huh?

09:22.935 --> 09:25.403
I'll wait outside.
Thank you, Jean.

09:25.505 --> 09:27.439
Sit down, Simon.

09:27.573 --> 09:30.303
Look, Jean ...

09:30.443 --> 09:33.139
your secretary, she loved
working for you.

09:34.179 --> 09:37.910
She did this well all her
life, congratulations.

09:38.016 --> 09:40.246
Your secretary, however, was also
my mother.

09:40.352 --> 09:43.116
Then her job as a mother,
that's another story.

09:43.288 --> 09:44.312
Simon ...

09:44.456 --> 09:46.947
You can bury your secretary
in any way you wish.

09:47.125 --> 09:49.684
But my mother, I want her
buried in the normal way.

09:49.827 --> 09:51.419
For once in your fucking life

09:51.529 --> 09:53.622
make it something normal.

09:55.499 --> 09:56.989
This is not negotiable.

10:10.847 --> 10:12.212
Take your time.

10:12.348 --> 10:14.976
And come see me when Simon
has calmed down.

10:19.888 --> 10:22.482
I know it's very unusual, but ...

10:24.993 --> 10:27.484
your mother was not crazy, Jeanne.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.872
We have a large family now.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.086
She spoke of a traitor?

10:55.222 --> 10:57.816
In a big family, there's always a dog.

10:57.924 --> 11:00.552
How long will it be before we
find the traitor?

11:01.728 --> 11:03.251
Fucking crazy woman!

11:09.168 --> 11:10.829
I'll fix that with Jean.

11:10.936 --> 11:12.369
Fix what?

11:12.505 --> 11:15.065
We'll give her a
normal funeral.

11:18.243 --> 11:21.212
We'll take care of her, then
I'll take care of you.

11:34.458 --> 11:36.426
Where are you going?

11:36.560 --> 11:38.721
You bury her any way you like!

11:38.896 --> 11:40.386
Oh, stop!

11:41.732 --> 11:43.723
You feel guilty because
you were not there

11:43.901 --> 11:44.868
when she died.

11:44.968 --> 11:46.798
You feel guilty because
you were there

11:46.936 --> 11:48.233
when she had her accident.

11:48.404 --> 11:50.929
You need to stop you feeling
guilty for everything!

11:51.073 --> 11:52.768
I am not feeling guilty
about anything.

11:52.909 --> 11:55.400
Do you realize the significance of
what he just read?

11:55.578 --> 11:56.738
Well, she's gone!

11:56.879 --> 11:58.779
It's over, I'm at peace!

12:03.418 --> 12:05.545
I have fucking peace!

12:10.759 --> 12:12.784
I'm at peace now.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.056
Yes, I see.

12:21.335 --> 12:25.135
Mathematics as you
have known so far

12:25.272 --> 12:29.231
have aimed to achieve a precise
and definitive response

12:29.343 --> 12:32.277
to precise and definitive problems.

12:32.445 --> 12:35.903
Now, you are about to enter into
entirely different adventure.

12:36.015 --> 12:38.506
The subject will be
intractable problems

12:38.651 --> 12:40.243
that will always lead

12:40.353 --> 12:43.288
to other problems just
as intractable.

12:43.456 --> 12:46.151
People around you will
repeatedly insist

12:46.291 --> 12:49.283
that what you are doing is
hopeless.

12:49.461 --> 12:52.453
You'll have no argument
to defend yourself,

12:52.598 --> 12:55.362
because they will be of an
overwhelming complexity.

12:56.768 --> 12:59.703
Welcome to pure mathematics,

12:59.838 --> 13:01.828
the land of loneliness.

13:01.973 --> 13:04.965
This is my assistant,

13:05.109 --> 13:06.940
Miss Jeanne Marwan.

13:07.979 --> 13:09.469
Hello!

13:12.717 --> 13:15.514
We will start with the conjecture
of Syracuse.

13:18.355 --> 13:20.823
What does your intuition
tell you?

13:27.964 --> 13:29.828
Your intuition is always right.

13:29.999 --> 13:32.194
That's why you got potential

13:32.334 --> 13:34.734
to becoming a real mathematician.

13:34.870 --> 13:37.498
But over there, you'll need help.

13:38.674 --> 13:40.665
Do you have any family there?

13:42.211 --> 13:44.872
- Contacts?
- It's ridiculous, Niv.

13:45.013 --> 13:48.540
You've come to learn that
a) your father is alive;

13:48.683 --> 13:50.742
and b) you have another brother.

13:50.885 --> 13:51.977
This is ridiculous

13:52.086 --> 13:55.487
What is ridiculous to question
the inevitable.

13:55.590 --> 13:57.080
You need to know.

13:58.092 --> 14:00.753
Otherwise, your mind
will never be at peace.

14:02.763 --> 14:06.426
And peace of mind has nothing to
do with pure mathematics.

14:10.070 --> 14:12.163
You need a starting point.

14:17.877 --> 14:20.209
My father died during
the war in Daresh.

14:20.346 --> 14:22.576
That's the unknown variable
in the equation.

14:22.715 --> 14:25.707
You never start with the
unknown variable.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.584
My mother used to speak about
a village

14:29.721 --> 14:31.552
called Der Om, in Fouad.

14:32.791 --> 14:35.055
She graduated in French

14:35.226 --> 14:36.557
at the University of Daresh.

14:36.695 --> 14:39.630
If she studied, there is hope.

14:41.199 --> 14:43.723
Said Haidar.

14:43.901 --> 14:46.461
You'll go knock on the
door Said Haidar

14:46.603 --> 14:49.037
an old friend of mine who
teaches at Daresh.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.073
You can trust him.

17:47.239 --> 17:48.968
What are you doing?

17:49.107 --> 17:52.201
Mom! Are you Okay?

17:55.713 --> 17:58.079
Madam, that's my towel, please.

17:59.416 --> 18:00.906
Mom?

18:02.419 --> 18:03.886
Mom!

18:27.276 --> 18:28.766
Mom?

18:30.846 --> 18:32.336
What happened?

18:35.017 --> 18:36.450
Where's Jeanne?

18:39.454 --> 18:40.943
Mom?

18:53.467 --> 18:55.161
Does she suffer from migraines?

18:55.302 --> 18:56.291
No.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.597
- Memory loss?
- No.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.866
Loss of balance?

19:01.007 --> 19:02.031
No.

19:02.175 --> 19:03.767
Absent-minded?

19:03.877 --> 19:05.845
She's always absent.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.379
No, she was never absent.

20:19.214 --> 20:20.875
Wahab, come.

20:44.137 --> 20:45.570
Just get out of my sister's way.

20:47.740 --> 20:50.800
Son of refugees, where do you
think you're going?

20:56.214 --> 20:58.648
Nicolas, stop!

20:59.117 --> 21:00.243
Go back to your country.

21:01.486 --> 21:02.384
Wahab!

21:02.988 --> 21:06.048
We'll leave your hide
in your camps, believe me.

21:06.792 --> 21:07.780
Give me.

21:08.426 --> 21:10.326
- I want to kill her.
- It's mine to do.

21:12.463 --> 21:14.761
You have sullied the
family honor.

21:15.433 --> 21:16.331
- Enough!

21:17.401 --> 21:19.164
Go home!

21:20.271 --> 21:22.101
Go home!

21:28.745 --> 21:30.076
Outside.

21:36.985 --> 21:38.976
What have you done!

21:39.154 --> 21:42.590
You have humiliated us!
You have sullied the name of our family!

21:42.858 --> 21:46.487
Why God have you plunged
us in the dark?

21:49.298 --> 21:52.630
My God, what have you done?
Why did you do that?

21:52.800 --> 21:55.667
What will I do with you!
You want me to kill you?

21:57.605 --> 21:59.766
I'm pregnant, grandma.

22:00.842 --> 22:03.970
- My God, everything is black.
Why?

22:04.145 --> 22:06.339
Why have you done this?

22:07.047 --> 22:09.345
Do I have to kill you?

22:10.016 --> 22:12.484
What will I do with you?

23:32.027 --> 23:33.289
Come.

23:35.229 --> 23:37.925
Eat if you want your
child safe.

23:44.405 --> 23:46.100
Listen to me.

23:47.107 --> 23:49.268
There's nothing here for you.

23:50.777 --> 23:53.371
I'll help after the birth.

23:53.546 --> 23:55.639
I want you to go away.

23:57.250 --> 24:01.152
You'll go to live with
your uncle Charbel.

24:02.155 --> 24:04.452
There, you'll go to school.

24:04.556 --> 24:06.820
To learn to read,
to learn to think

24:06.992 --> 24:10.052
out of this misery.

24:11.663 --> 24:13.995
Promise me and I'll help you.

24:16.802 --> 24:20.430
Promise me you'll go to school.

24:26.777 --> 24:28.506
I promise you, grandmother.

24:31.015 --> 24:32.312
I promise.

26:35.564 --> 26:37.054
Shh.

26:52.313 --> 26:53.803
Shh.

27:13.833 --> 27:17.791
Look carefully at your mother.
You'll have to recognize her.

27:21.006 --> 27:27.241
I'll find you one day.
I promise you, my heart.

27:37.455 --> 27:40.481
Be careful.
Don't worry.

28:14.190 --> 28:16.657
Come on, it's time
for you to go.

28:17.826 --> 28:21.785
I feel that something terrible
is coming ...

28:37.478 --> 28:40.311
One day I'll find you, my son.

30:16.937 --> 30:20.805
I received a message
from my friend Niv Cohen

30:20.941 --> 30:23.000
but I can't help you

30:23.143 --> 30:25.111
because at the time,

30:25.245 --> 30:26.439
I taught

30:26.580 --> 30:29.946
History of Mathematics
in Paris.

30:30.115 --> 30:32.982
Specifically, the period

30:33.118 --> 30:37.077
where Euler had
succeeded

30:37.189 --> 30:39.123
to give the first

30:39.291 --> 30:42.454
formal mathematical resolution

30:42.627 --> 30:47.326
to the problem of the seven bridges
of Konigsberg, yes.

30:47.465 --> 30:50.457
Diderot defied the Court

30:50.602 --> 30:52.502
saying:

30:52.637 --> 30:53.695
"Gentlemen ..."

30:53.838 --> 30:57.466
I-ft plus

30:57.641 --> 30:58.972
Equals zero.

30:59.977 --> 31:02.138
So, God exists!"

31:04.314 --> 31:06.646
Niv, Niv, Niv ...

31:20.563 --> 31:22.724
Hello! Do you speak French?

31:22.865 --> 31:24.730
- Yes, of course!
- Can I help you?

31:24.867 --> 31:28.529
Uh, yes, I am looking for someone
who would have known this woman.

31:30.005 --> 31:32.496
She studied here maybe
35 years ago.

31:34.542 --> 31:36.066
Are you kidding me?

31:36.211 --> 31:37.371
I wasn't even born.

31:37.512 --> 31:39.673
Well, you're in the wrong
place...

31:39.814 --> 31:40.974
I'm not kidding.

31:41.082 --> 31:43.140
I'm sure you know someone
who can help me.

31:43.250 --> 31:44.808
I have come from far away.

31:44.918 --> 31:47.580
Please. Her name is Nawal Marwan.

31:56.529 --> 31:58.190
You are very kind.

31:58.331 --> 32:01.164
I'm not nice, I want
to get rid of you.

32:01.234 --> 32:02.826
Najat, that's me.

32:03.670 --> 32:05.433
You have time to waste?

32:06.572 --> 32:09.040
That tells me something.

32:09.175 --> 32:13.577
She may have worked in the
campus newspaper.

32:14.613 --> 32:16.103
It's been a long time.

32:18.717 --> 32:22.710
People who leave usually
change identities.

32:25.457 --> 32:27.390
It is striking nonetheless.

32:38.736 --> 32:42.865
Your mother was photographed
in Kfar Ryat.

32:42.972 --> 32:44.462
Look here.

32:45.775 --> 32:48.767
This is a sign of Kfar Ryat.

32:49.813 --> 32:52.714
It is a prison in the south.

32:56.785 --> 32:58.912
You do not know Kfar Ryat?

32:59.054 --> 33:00.078
- No.

33:00.255 --> 33:03.656
You're definitely not from
here.

33:04.927 --> 33:07.760
You don't know the South.

33:40.626 --> 33:42.753
If the international community

33:44.029 --> 33:46.657
does not intervene now

33:48.134 --> 33:49.658
The refugees in overcrowded

33:51.203 --> 33:55.696
camps at the border ...will be
massacred.

33:59.010 --> 34:00.500
She has arrived.

34:00.645 --> 34:01.771
OK.

34:01.880 --> 34:04.644
We, the students, are oppose
against the Nationalist Party

34:04.783 --> 34:07.149
that are trying to evict the refugees
across the borders.

34:07.318 --> 34:08.649
The National Party supports

34:08.820 --> 34:10.342
militias of the Christian right,

34:10.487 --> 34:12.387
who make open threats against
the refugees.

34:12.523 --> 34:14.514
In the South, the refugees
are now armed.

34:14.658 --> 34:16.455
And have the support

34:16.560 --> 34:20.860
of much of the country's Muslim
population.

34:20.998 --> 34:24.194
But you ...you're a Christian.

34:24.333 --> 34:26.824
We are for peace.

34:26.969 --> 34:29.335
Religion has nothing
to do with it.

34:38.980 --> 34:39.911
Nawal!

34:40.681 --> 34:43.172
Put the radio!
They've come to close
the University!

34:43.351 --> 34:46.013
The Nationalists have
closed the campus!

35:01.435 --> 35:03.198
Nawal, come back.

35:04.004 --> 35:05.665
Stay here.

35:08.775 --> 35:11.266
Uncle Charbel, the Nationalists
are closing the campus!

35:11.544 --> 35:15.241
There will be clashes.

35:15.415 --> 35:17.576
Stay with me.

35:36.301 --> 35:37.461
There is shooting outside ...

35:40.204 --> 35:41.364
To the table, girls!

35:41.539 --> 35:43.404
Mom, they're attacking
the university!

35:43.541 --> 35:46.271
It's not a reason not to eat!

35:54.251 --> 35:55.741
Aioua?

36:25.947 --> 36:29.246
Christian villages were attacked
in the South this morning.

36:29.417 --> 36:31.510
May God protect us!

36:31.686 --> 36:33.677
That's why they closed
the university.

36:33.855 --> 36:37.187
In short time, it will
explode here as well.

36:38.792 --> 36:43.661
We'll go to the mountain
until it calms down.

36:44.631 --> 36:46.121
For how long?

36:46.800 --> 36:47.858
We start tomorrow.

36:48.035 --> 36:50.799
The rest of the family
is already there.

36:50.971 --> 36:52.460
And the school?

36:53.606 --> 36:55.972
Anyway, the school will close.

36:56.475 --> 36:58.443
Only God knows how long.

36:58.978 --> 37:00.206
And Le Journal?

37:01.047 --> 37:02.537
Don't be afraid.

37:02.715 --> 37:06.116
Le Journal can survive without
us for a while.

37:06.952 --> 37:09.978
But ideas only survive if someone
is there to defend them!

37:10.155 --> 37:11.952
Exactly, Rafqa.

37:13.024 --> 37:14.616
Exactly.

37:26.170 --> 37:28.832
There are only two orphanages
in the region.

37:28.973 --> 37:30.838
I will join you soon.

37:31.008 --> 37:33.169
You will not go there now!

37:35.045 --> 37:37.342
You had promised Grandma you
would finish your studies.

37:37.513 --> 37:39.037
You heard your father.

37:39.182 --> 37:42.208
It's going to explode across the country
if they attack the camps.

37:43.219 --> 37:44.686
The studies are finished.

37:49.392 --> 37:51.018
I think of him every day.

37:51.193 --> 37:52.854
That's my child.

37:54.096 --> 37:55.825
I want to find him alive.

38:16.951 --> 38:19.419
I'm going to fetch
water from Shadia.

38:19.587 --> 38:21.850
Hurry, Nawal.

40:21.199 --> 40:22.996
- Your name?
- Nawal.

40:23.168 --> 40:25.500
- Nawal what?
- Nawal Marwan.

40:26.338 --> 40:27.498
Where are you going?

40:27.906 --> 40:28.873
South.

40:29.040 --> 40:30.029
What for?

40:30.809 --> 40:32.538
To meet my husband.

42:54.542 --> 42:55.975
Wahab.

43:22.669 --> 43:25.069
You have only daughters?

43:25.672 --> 43:28.505
The older boys are in Kfar
Kout.

43:30.976 --> 43:34.139
You should go with us.
Kfar Kout was attacked
yesterday.

45:04.130 --> 45:07.622
Looking for the orphanage.
You know where is it?

45:08.334 --> 45:09.266
There.

45:10.236 --> 45:13.171
The children?
Where are the children?

45:14.172 --> 45:16.504
You should speak with those
who were there.

45:16.674 --> 45:22.078
The muslim villagers fled
to the camp Deressa.

45:22.580 --> 45:25.174
They fear reprisals will come.

45:25.617 --> 45:28.744
The children may be with them.

45:30.621 --> 45:36.856
Chamseddine and his men killed all the
Christians to avenge the refugees.

45:38.962 --> 45:42.693
Perhaps the children are in Deressa.

47:06.244 --> 47:08.212
Can you take me to the camp in Deressa?

51:11.271 --> 51:12.738
I am a Christian.

51:24.751 --> 51:27.311
My daughter! My daughter!

51:34.127 --> 51:35.355
Mom!

55:03.554 --> 55:04.953
Hi, Simon, it's me!

55:05.056 --> 55:06.853
I am in Mama's village.

55:06.991 --> 55:08.788
I wish you were here with me.

55:08.893 --> 55:09.825
Listen.

55:32.649 --> 55:35.014
Oh, I'm sorry, I do not understand.

56:08.682 --> 56:11.845
I told you never to come here again!

56:15.188 --> 56:16.177
Hello!

56:17.523 --> 56:18.512
Souha?

56:22.061 --> 56:25.030
Ahmed loves you!
Ahmed loves you!

56:29.402 --> 56:32.461
I told you not to say that again!

56:35.206 --> 56:36.195
Hello.

56:36.708 --> 56:37.766
Can I help you?

56:41.780 --> 56:42.747
Hello.

56:44.215 --> 56:48.548
Does anyone speak French
or English?

56:49.219 --> 56:50.914
Where's Sami?

56:59.596 --> 57:01.586
Marhaba!
Marhaba!

57:02.632 --> 57:04.657
Hello!
Hello!

57:04.801 --> 57:05.790
Hello!

57:12.288 --> 57:13.561
Uh, Jeanne.

57:20.068 --> 57:21.365
Jeanne.

57:25.006 --> 57:26.337
Jeanne.

57:28.308 --> 57:29.673
Uh ...

57:34.313 --> 57:35.302
Thank you.

57:50.860 --> 57:54.318
- You speak French?
- Yes, hello!

57:54.430 --> 57:55.829
Hello.

57:55.932 --> 57:58.400
My name is Samia.

57:58.534 --> 58:00.831
I am Jeanne Marwan.

58:00.935 --> 58:02.334
Thank you for helping me.

58:02.436 --> 58:05.872
Marwan?
There are many Marwans here.

58:06.040 --> 58:07.530
Really?

58:08.909 --> 58:11.036
Well, I'm from Canada.

58:12.078 --> 58:14.046
I'm looking for Souha.

58:14.214 --> 58:16.340
She is Souha.

58:16.448 --> 58:19.178
She is my great-grandmother.

58:19.284 --> 58:21.878
- Oh! Marhaba!
- Marhaba.

58:28.393 --> 58:31.589
The people in the corner shop
told me to come see you.

58:38.034 --> 58:39.626
I am looking for my father.

58:39.769 --> 58:41.430
His name is Wahab.

58:47.241 --> 58:50.472
Uh ...My mother's name
is Nawal Marwan.

58:52.279 --> 58:53.439
She was born here.

59:01.453 --> 59:02.943
We do not know her.

59:04.121 --> 59:05.645
Of course you know her.

59:11.996 --> 59:15.226
The Marwan family was struck with
shame.

59:33.246 --> 59:35.237
When the war came.

59:40.152 --> 59:42.518
Uh, I'm looking for Wahab.

59:46.290 --> 59:48.258
She does not know Wahab.

59:52.529 --> 59:57.262
I can not help you.
Sorry, I'm tired.

01:00:06.307 --> 01:00:10.300
If you're Nawal Marwan daughter,

01:00:11.479 --> 01:00:14.504
you're not welcome here.

01:00:14.647 --> 01:00:16.137
Go home.

01:00:20.686 --> 01:00:22.551
She is looking for her father,

01:00:22.721 --> 01:00:25.519
but she doesn't know
who is her mother.

01:02:59.452 --> 01:03:02.580
<i>I arrived at the end of the massacre
in the Deressa refugee camp.</i>

01:03:04.023 --> 01:03:05.957
<i>Everything was burning.</i>

01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:10.658
<i>I looked for my son amid
waves of blood.</i>

01:03:11.295 --> 01:03:15.493
<i>I was disheartened by what I saw
and heard.</i>

01:03:16.699 --> 01:03:18.929
You claim to be against
our enemy.

01:03:19.669 --> 01:03:22.866
That does not make you our friend.

01:03:24.374 --> 01:03:26.933
Chamseddine. why would
he trust you?

01:03:28.209 --> 01:03:30.507
My son's father was
a refugee from Deressa.

01:03:30.678 --> 01:03:32.646
My son has been swallowed
by the war.

01:03:34.181 --> 01:03:36.308
I have nothing to lose.

01:03:38.184 --> 01:03:41.209
My hatred is great toward
the Nationalists.

01:03:42.354 --> 01:03:45.653
This is not what you wrote
in Charbel's journal.

01:03:46.725 --> 01:03:51.219
My uncle Charbel thought to encourage
peace with words and books.

01:03:52.797 --> 01:03:54.355
I believed that.

01:03:56.867 --> 01:03:58.698
Life has taught me
something else.

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:03.301
What are you going to do now?

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:09.536
Teach the enemy what
life has taught me.

01:05:03.556 --> 01:05:05.717
That's good. That's good.

01:05:05.891 --> 01:05:08.723
You've just forgotten it. Let's go.

01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:15.427
So in French?

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:19.562
I ... I am much better, Dad.

01:05:19.737 --> 01:05:21.204
They say "a lot" or "best"

01:05:21.305 --> 01:05:24.034
but never both at the same
time, my darling.

01:05:26.908 --> 01:05:29.706
I want my son to learn to speak
several languages.

01:05:29.878 --> 01:05:32.745
I want him to understand others
without an intermediary.

01:05:59.169 --> 01:06:01.831
How are you, Nawal?
It's Nouchine.

01:06:03.006 --> 01:06:06.339
Good evening, Nouchine.
How's your mother?

01:06:06.509 --> 01:06:10.308
My mother is very well.
10:00 o'clock tomorrow.

01:06:12.414 --> 01:06:14.109
Tomorrow.

01:07:03.657 --> 01:07:05.147
Marhaba.

01:07:30.245 --> 01:07:31.303
Hello, beautiful.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.572
Good morning.

01:07:33.014 --> 01:07:34.743
Then you will be going out
with us on Thursday?

01:07:34.916 --> 01:07:35.905
No.

01:07:36.584 --> 01:07:37.516
Friday?

01:07:37.685 --> 01:07:38.743
No.

01:07:38.918 --> 01:07:39.850
Saturday?

01:07:40.019 --> 01:07:41.316
No.

01:07:42.889 --> 01:07:45.016
We are patient!

01:07:45.225 --> 01:07:46.658
Me too.

01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:01.537
Never forget:

01:08:01.705 --> 01:08:03.696
"Always" is "always".

01:09:05.890 --> 01:09:06.880
Fucking bitch.

01:10:49.811 --> 01:10:52.006
The prison at Kfar
Ryat was condemned in

01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:55.047
several reports by Amnesty
International.

01:11:03.690 --> 01:11:05.658
Here is the women's section.

01:11:07.227 --> 01:11:08.888
The cells are larger.

01:11:09.029 --> 01:11:12.192
Some prisoners remained
there up to 15 years.

01:11:21.705 --> 01:11:25.038
- It has existed since when?
- At the time of the massacres.

01:11:25.175 --> 01:11:27.006
Just after the war began.

01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:29.840
They have 600 political
prisoners jailed.

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:33.911
You can come in, eh?

01:11:34.049 --> 01:11:35.573
I'll take a picture.

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.289
You know this woman?

01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:51.196
No.

01:11:51.296 --> 01:11:53.526
She was imprisoned here.

01:11:55.434 --> 01:11:56.458
I don't know her.

01:11:56.601 --> 01:11:58.762
It was a really long time
ago, you know? I...

01:11:58.904 --> 01:12:01.872
Maybe you know someone
who worked here.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.068
Hello.

01:12:50.279 --> 01:12:51.473
Hello.

01:12:54.850 --> 01:12:57.284
I'm looking for Harrsa Fahim.

01:13:00.955 --> 01:13:03.947
I am the school janitor.

01:13:04.091 --> 01:13:05.991
Yes, but before, what were you?

01:13:06.126 --> 01:13:08.526
Before, hum!

01:13:08.661 --> 01:13:11.528
That was before I became the
school janitor.

01:13:11.664 --> 01:13:14.963
It's been a long time since I'm
caretaker of the school.

01:13:17.201 --> 01:13:19.135
You know this woman?

01:13:19.303 --> 01:13:20.930
She was in Kfar Ryat.

01:13:23.875 --> 01:13:27.140
I am a school janitor.
Bess! That's all.

01:13:30.213 --> 01:13:32.339
I am looking for someone
who knew her.

01:13:32.481 --> 01:13:34.949
Someone who could
tell me about her.

01:13:37.485 --> 01:13:38.952
This is my mother.

01:13:42.157 --> 01:13:45.023
This is the woman who sings.

01:13:45.159 --> 01:13:46.285
Number 72.

01:13:48.461 --> 01:13:50.895
It was she who murdered the
militia leader

01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:52.497
of the christian right.

01:13:53.699 --> 01:13:55.860
They made her pay dearly.

01:13:56.002 --> 01:13:58.835
Very, very dearly.
Fifteen years.

01:14:03.841 --> 01:14:05.741
They used to call her the
woman who sings

01:14:05.876 --> 01:14:08.037
because she sang all the time.

01:14:09.145 --> 01:14:11.170
Han, you are sure it's her?

01:14:12.248 --> 01:14:15.080
I spent 13 years as a watchman.

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:21.686
Have you ever spent 13 years
overseeing someone?

01:14:24.659 --> 01:14:27.219
They did everything
to make her break.

01:14:28.863 --> 01:14:32.923
In the end, she was
still standing,

01:14:33.065 --> 01:14:35.158
She looked ...

01:14:36.202 --> 01:14:38.033
Ah! Never seen anything like it.

01:14:38.204 --> 01:14:40.536
She never broke.

01:14:40.672 --> 01:14:43.505
It was exasperating.

01:14:50.713 --> 01:14:53.375
And then they sent Abu Tarek.

01:14:53.549 --> 01:14:54.538
Who's that?

01:15:04.625 --> 01:15:06.752
Abu Tarek...

01:15:07.962 --> 01:15:11.454
You know, sometimes it's better

01:15:11.598 --> 01:15:14.122
not to know everything.

01:15:14.266 --> 01:15:16.234
Sir, I live with it anyway.

01:15:17.236 --> 01:15:18.726
Continue.

01:15:20.272 --> 01:15:21.466
Abu Tarek...

01:15:22.907 --> 01:15:26.399
Abu Tarek was a investigation
specialist.

01:15:26.577 --> 01:15:28.737
He raped her repeatedly

01:15:28.912 --> 01:15:31.813
to break her before being
released.

01:15:31.948 --> 01:15:34.746
To stop her from singing.

01:15:38.287 --> 01:15:41.916
Eventually she became pregnant.

01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:45.424
It was like that.

01:15:45.592 --> 01:15:47.753
I'll never forget it.

01:15:47.928 --> 01:15:51.386
Number 72 pregnant by Abu Tarek.

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:54.927
They waited ...

01:15:55.067 --> 01:15:57.558
for her to give birth in prison

01:15:57.670 --> 01:16:00.638
then they let her go.

01:16:03.941 --> 01:16:06.739
The child?
Did you see the child?

01:16:08.946 --> 01:16:12.347
There was a doctor who came
sometimes.

01:16:13.349 --> 01:16:15.442
I think he's crazy.

01:16:15.617 --> 01:16:18.950
Others say he has a restaurant
in Tel Aviv ...

01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:22.622
That's bullshit.

01:16:22.758 --> 01:16:25.454
He went mad and died.

01:16:25.626 --> 01:16:28.992
His nurse, I know her.

01:16:29.129 --> 01:16:31.290
She lives in Daresh.

01:16:34.334 --> 01:16:35.824
In Daresh?

01:16:44.475 --> 01:16:45.874
Listen, Simon, I'm calling you!

01:16:46.009 --> 01:16:49.206
I'm calling you, no, shut up, OK?
Shut your mouth!

01:16:49.346 --> 01:16:51.837
Mom, she was in prison.
Simon, mom, she ...

01:16:53.116 --> 01:16:54.981
Mom, she was raped.

01:16:56.485 --> 01:16:58.543
Our brother, she had him in prison.

01:17:00.355 --> 01:17:02.220
I need you here.

01:17:19.049 --> 01:17:23.149
THE WOMAN THAT SINGS

01:20:01.474 --> 01:20:04.807
This, Simon, are notary Amyott
contracts

01:20:04.977 --> 01:20:05.966
from 1868 to 1892.

01:20:06.111 --> 01:20:09.443
His son took over,
Ã‰douard, until 1925.

01:20:09.546 --> 01:20:11.878
All the contracts are hand-written.

01:20:12.015 --> 01:20:14.779
My grandfather, Charles,
my father, Henry.

01:20:14.885 --> 01:20:16.352
And me.

01:20:16.486 --> 01:20:19.182
Yeah, well, it stops there
because as you know,

01:20:19.322 --> 01:20:20.687
I am the last of the Lebel.

01:20:20.823 --> 01:20:23.223
I'll show you the
will of a man ...

01:20:26.161 --> 01:20:27.992
...which took several lives.

01:20:30.798 --> 01:20:32.197
His heirs have discovered

01:20:32.333 --> 01:20:34.164
he had three wives, all
at the same time.

01:20:34.301 --> 01:20:35.325
One here, one in Miami,

01:20:35.503 --> 01:20:38.165
and another in Honduras,
where he did business.

01:20:39.571 --> 01:20:43.405
No, no ...he not longer has
three children in the file there, no

01:20:43.542 --> 01:20:44.509
There are eight.

01:20:44.676 --> 01:20:46.871
That is sport, my man.

01:20:48.679 --> 01:20:50.544
Look. Hum!

01:20:52.583 --> 01:20:55.073
Death is never the
end of a story.

01:20:55.218 --> 01:20:56.913
There are still traces.

01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:01.084
If you want to find
your brother,

01:21:01.223 --> 01:21:03.657
you'll have to go back into
your mother's past.

01:21:03.759 --> 01:21:06.353
Jean, I'm going to fetch my
sister, that's all.

01:21:06.495 --> 01:21:07.427
I'll take care of that.

01:21:07.563 --> 01:21:09.757
Two, three small matters
to take care,

01:21:09.897 --> 01:21:11.364
then it will take no time.

01:21:11.532 --> 01:21:13.261
Well, get your business ready

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:14.662
we should go in ...

01:21:14.768 --> 01:21:16.668
My passport ...

01:21:16.770 --> 01:21:20.206
"We"? Don't you worry that
you already done enough already

01:21:20.339 --> 01:21:23.535
Exactly, this is not the
time to let you down.

01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:27.205
Make a man out of you, Simon.

01:21:27.345 --> 01:21:29.540
I know that you need me.

01:21:32.349 --> 01:21:33.941
We'll get it, then come back.

01:21:34.084 --> 01:21:35.449
I promise.

01:21:35.586 --> 01:21:37.610
Then, promise, Mr. Marwan,

01:21:37.754 --> 01:21:40.917
a notary is on the order
of the sacred.

01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:38.997
Sing now.

01:25:45.795 --> 01:25:48.160
Gently, gently.

01:25:50.298 --> 01:25:51.663
He is coming out.

01:25:52.067 --> 01:25:53.466
We can see the head.

01:25:53.634 --> 01:25:54.999
Push, push.

01:25:55.636 --> 01:25:57.228
Go, girl.

01:26:05.577 --> 01:26:07.169
The first came out.

01:26:28.130 --> 01:26:31.361
Rest now ...

01:26:32.467 --> 01:26:33.832
I'm proud of you.

01:26:35.769 --> 01:26:37.794
Get ready for the second.

01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:08.491
Stop.

01:27:08.730 --> 01:27:10.061
Stop.

01:27:11.233 --> 01:27:12.165
What are you doing?

01:27:12.501 --> 01:27:14.731
You are going to dump them in the
river as usual.

01:27:16.538 --> 01:27:17.834
- It's dangerous.
- No.

01:27:17.971 --> 01:27:21.907
You've done your duty.
Throw them in the river.

01:27:22.075 --> 01:27:23.702
I want to take care of them.

01:27:24.177 --> 01:27:26.737
These are the children of
the woman who sings.

01:27:46.729 --> 01:27:49.857
Oh, this country is a war
zone after another, eh!

01:27:50.031 --> 01:27:51.089
It's not complicated.

01:27:51.233 --> 01:27:53.724
If the notary had existed
at the time of Noah,

01:27:53.869 --> 01:27:55.029
we would not be here.

01:27:55.170 --> 01:27:57.934
We need only to find the
original contracts.

01:27:58.073 --> 01:28:01.701
That's up to you, that's up to you.
And a right of passage there.

01:28:01.841 --> 01:28:02.830
And we talk more about it.

01:28:02.942 --> 01:28:04.375
Everyone would be happy.

01:28:04.544 --> 01:28:07.342
Notaries have existed
only in the last 1,000 years, Simon.

01:28:07.447 --> 01:28:09.108
That's the problem.

01:28:09.249 --> 01:28:11.376
I should have been here from
the beginning.

01:28:11.517 --> 01:28:14.247
Thank you again for your
help, Me Maddad.

01:28:14.386 --> 01:28:16.910
The pleasure is all
mine, my dear fellow.

01:28:17.054 --> 01:28:18.715
I have the result

01:28:18.856 --> 01:28:20.790
that you have requested
via email.

01:28:20.924 --> 01:28:23.552
Simon my file on
the seat beside you.

01:28:23.693 --> 01:28:26.526
Could you give it to
Lebel, please?

01:28:26.630 --> 01:28:29.565
You are very nice, but the
delay and everything ...

01:28:29.699 --> 01:28:31.962
I think I'll wait until later.

01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:33.294
But I'll summarize.

01:28:33.434 --> 01:28:35.061
For the father, it is
rather difficult

01:28:35.236 --> 01:28:37.136
because I can not find
the death certificate.

01:28:37.272 --> 01:28:38.239
For the brother ...

01:28:38.373 --> 01:28:40.238
Excuse me, but what
are we talking about here?

01:28:40.408 --> 01:28:42.069
I asked for help, Simon.

01:28:42.242 --> 01:28:44.972
Me Maddad kindly gave us a hand

01:28:45.112 --> 01:28:46.442
to speed things up.

01:28:46.579 --> 01:28:49.878
I told you, Jean,
we came for Jeanne.

01:28:51.250 --> 01:28:53.912
Your sister is the one person
in your family

01:28:54.085 --> 01:28:55.484
easiest to find.

01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:05.128
I'm so glad you're here.

01:29:05.261 --> 01:29:07.422
Me too.

01:29:13.969 --> 01:29:15.936
OK, that's the nurse's name.

01:29:16.103 --> 01:29:17.934
which helped your mother give birth
in prison.

01:29:18.072 --> 01:29:19.630
We can go today.

01:29:20.641 --> 01:29:22.939
Jeanne, that's enough.

01:29:24.811 --> 01:29:26.779
No, you shut up, then follow me.

01:29:26.947 --> 01:29:29.847
It's your job to find our
brother, not mine!

01:29:29.982 --> 01:29:32.280
Then, if you don't do it for
her or for you,

01:29:32.451 --> 01:29:34.146
the, do it for me!

01:29:40.325 --> 01:29:42.122
She is at the American hospital.

01:29:48.264 --> 01:29:50.027
I'm glad you're here, Jean.

01:29:50.166 --> 01:29:52.100
Me too, my owl, me too.

01:29:53.169 --> 01:29:55.467
If she is sleeping, you must return
later.

01:30:19.890 --> 01:30:21.380
Ms. Maika?

01:30:50.143 --> 01:30:53.306
Lebel, Jeanne Marwan,
Simon Marwan.

01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:54.845
Bonjour, Madame!

01:30:54.981 --> 01:30:56.471
Thank you for having us.

01:30:56.649 --> 01:30:59.481
We seek someone you know.

01:30:59.617 --> 01:31:01.847
Nawal Marwan, do you know her?

01:31:30.010 --> 01:31:32.877
You worked in the Kfar Ryat prison
as a nurse?

01:31:47.358 --> 01:31:49.656
She says she knows your mom.

01:31:50.861 --> 01:31:53.091
You helped our mother
give birth in prison?

01:31:57.699 --> 01:31:59.030
Yes.

01:32:05.673 --> 01:32:09.370
Madame, the child we seek is Nawal
Marwan's son that was born in prison.

01:32:09.544 --> 01:32:10.943
Can you help us?

01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:17.913
She worked in the prison
of Kfar Ryat.

01:32:19.051 --> 01:32:21.611
She assisted her
during childbirth.

01:32:23.054 --> 01:32:25.045
She gathered the children.

01:32:31.862 --> 01:32:34.524
Then she gave them back
to the woman who sings

01:32:34.630 --> 01:32:36.564
when she got out of prison.

01:32:37.767 --> 01:32:39.894
Nawal Marwan gave
birth to twins.

01:32:42.804 --> 01:32:44.271
Hush, hush, hush.

01:32:46.373 --> 01:32:48.238
Hush, hush, hush.

01:36:54.782 --> 01:36:57.444
You really know the
woman who sings?

01:36:57.583 --> 01:37:00.609
You don't know what
it means to me.

01:37:01.788 --> 01:37:03.756
Nawal Marwan worked for me

01:37:03.856 --> 01:37:05.448
as a secretary for 18 years.

01:37:05.591 --> 01:37:07.820
My wife and I, we had
taken a liking

01:37:07.958 --> 01:37:09.448
to her and her children.

01:37:10.461 --> 01:37:11.792
But I confess that I

01:37:11.962 --> 01:37:14.453
didn't really know her till the end.

01:37:17.134 --> 01:37:19.295
- Ready?
- Ready.

01:37:31.345 --> 01:37:32.835
Hmm ...

01:37:34.482 --> 01:37:36.972
Me Maddadi has conducted an
investigation, at my request,

01:37:37.150 --> 01:37:40.313
to track your brother
and your father.

01:37:45.825 --> 01:37:47.452
For the father, Abu Tarek,

01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:50.324
I still have not found
a death certificate.

01:37:50.495 --> 01:37:52.621
The country has a lot
of certificates missing.

01:37:52.729 --> 01:37:54.959
He could have gone abroad.

01:37:55.065 --> 01:37:58.364
That's what happened with
this kind of characters.

01:37:58.502 --> 01:37:59.901
They are dead or have disappeared.

01:38:00.036 --> 01:38:01.162
You have to see.

01:38:01.337 --> 01:38:03.498
Maybe it's better that way.

01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:06.905
For the brother ...

01:38:07.042 --> 01:38:09.340
your client, Ms. Nawal Marwan,

01:38:09.477 --> 01:38:11.342
comes from the village
of Der Om.

01:38:11.512 --> 01:38:15.744
She gave the child to a midwife
who's named Elham

01:38:15.883 --> 01:38:19.683
who herself returned it to
the orphanage in Kfar Kout

01:38:19.854 --> 01:38:22.185
in May 1970.

01:38:23.522 --> 01:38:26.389
The main task was to
trace the registry records.

01:38:26.525 --> 01:38:29.085
Many documents have been
lost in the war.

01:38:30.095 --> 01:38:32.689
But I found the records

01:38:32.830 --> 01:38:35.094
which were recovered and donated

01:38:35.233 --> 01:38:39.362
by the Sisters of Charity
to the National Archives.

01:38:39.502 --> 01:38:43.199
In May 1970, the midwife at
Der Om, Elham

01:38:43.372 --> 01:38:46.205
filed a petition for adoption
of a male child.

01:38:46.342 --> 01:38:51.005
This is the only boy in the
orphanage filed in that month.

01:38:51.112 --> 01:38:52.443
Look.

01:38:52.579 --> 01:38:55.742
It was registered under
the name Nihad.

01:38:57.584 --> 01:38:59.711
The dates match.

01:38:59.853 --> 01:39:01.343
That's him.

01:39:02.356 --> 01:39:05.518
Ha! It's your brother! Nihad.

01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:11.051
Orphanage Kfar Kout,

01:39:11.196 --> 01:39:12.254
Nihad May.

01:39:12.397 --> 01:39:15.457
It's his name in the registry.

01:39:15.599 --> 01:39:16.793
Nihad from the month of May.

01:39:16.934 --> 01:39:19.368
They gave him a temporary name

01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:20.800
with the month of arrival.

01:39:20.937 --> 01:39:23.963
There was no adoption
during that period.

01:39:24.106 --> 01:39:25.903
It was the beginning of the war.

01:39:26.074 --> 01:39:28.804
The orphanage was destroyed
four years later.

01:39:30.078 --> 01:39:32.740
We must ask those that destroyed
the orphanage in Kfar Kout

01:39:32.881 --> 01:39:35.747
to know what happened
to the children.

01:39:37.751 --> 01:39:41.414
Between you and me, with what
happened in the region ...

01:39:42.422 --> 01:39:43.912
there is not much hope.

01:39:45.391 --> 01:39:47.416
They are probably also dead.

01:39:47.559 --> 01:39:49.617
I'm not saying they're dead.

01:39:49.761 --> 01:39:51.888
I say we lost track of them.

01:39:53.598 --> 01:39:55.429
They are both dead.

01:39:55.565 --> 01:39:57.999
We open the envelopes,
that's it, then.

01:39:58.135 --> 01:39:59.966
That I will not allow, Simon.

01:40:00.103 --> 01:40:01.934
This kind of thing is sacred.

01:40:05.775 --> 01:40:07.970
Luckily, I have a history.

01:40:10.679 --> 01:40:12.772
Excuse me.

01:40:14.416 --> 01:40:16.509
It is still worth exploring.

01:40:16.650 --> 01:40:19.914
But it is a little radical.

01:40:20.954 --> 01:40:21.921
The warlord

01:40:22.021 --> 01:40:24.649
that demolished the orphanage
at that time is still alive.

01:40:24.791 --> 01:40:26.850
And he may know what happened

01:40:26.992 --> 01:40:29.187
to Nihad's children and where
they went.

01:40:29.328 --> 01:40:30.522
It's already been an eternity.

01:40:30.662 --> 01:40:32.323
You must understand

01:40:32.464 --> 01:40:35.660
that during this period there were
a series of reprisals

01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:39.327
which fit one another in
a sort of inexorable logic,

01:40:43.306 --> 01:40:45.274
A warlord is exactly

01:40:45.375 --> 01:40:47.536
the type of man who
has a long memory.

01:40:47.677 --> 01:40:50.008
And he will remember, believe me.

01:40:51.446 --> 01:40:53.277
Wallat Chamseddine,

01:40:53.381 --> 01:40:54.814
is his name.

01:40:59.119 --> 01:41:00.484
We can find him here?

01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:03.611
If we don't find him, he
will find us.

01:41:06.492 --> 01:41:08.517
But we can try something.

01:41:10.362 --> 01:41:13.024
Would you like tea, Mr. Marwan?

01:41:17.035 --> 01:41:19.002
It's your turn.

01:41:22.472 --> 01:41:24.201
You will go

01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:26.331
to the Deressa refugee camp.

01:41:26.509 --> 01:41:27.976
You will come to tea

01:41:28.077 --> 01:41:29.339
anywhere in the camp

01:41:29.512 --> 01:41:31.377
with the person that invite you.

01:41:31.513 --> 01:41:34.504
And you say you are the son
of the woman who sings

01:41:34.648 --> 01:41:36.513
and are looking Nihad May.

01:41:36.684 --> 01:41:38.811
You can not go there alone.

01:41:40.087 --> 01:41:42.180
I'll find someone

01:41:42.322 --> 01:41:43.846
to accompany you.

01:42:05.941 --> 01:42:07.704
Welcome to Deressa.

01:43:16.266 --> 01:43:18.097
Ha! Ha! You know where you
are going, Simon?

01:43:18.268 --> 01:43:19.667
I know.

01:43:46.025 --> 01:43:47.253
How are you?

01:43:48.594 --> 01:43:50.084
In the name of God, you've grown!

01:43:50.262 --> 01:43:53.026
I have finished my engineering studies.

01:43:53.198 --> 01:43:57.828
I cannot find work, so I'm
a taxi driver now.

01:43:58.002 --> 01:44:00.027
What brings you here?

01:44:00.203 --> 01:44:05.266
I am with some foreign visitors, who
asked me to bring them here.

01:44:07.144 --> 01:44:09.009
Welcome, come.

01:44:09.178 --> 01:44:11.510
No, thank you, we're
in a hurry.

01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:13.511
Please, come.

01:44:18.819 --> 01:44:21.549
He is inviting us to tea.

01:44:21.688 --> 01:44:22.814
Oh, good!

01:44:40.037 --> 01:44:43.871
Uh, I wonder why you have
come to Deressa.

01:44:47.010 --> 01:44:49.501
I am looking for someone
named Nihad de Mai.

01:44:58.854 --> 01:45:01.845
He does not know Nihad de Mai.

01:45:01.988 --> 01:45:05.185
He asks me what are your names.

01:45:12.531 --> 01:45:15.363
My mother comes from the village
of Der de Om, in the South.

01:45:28.611 --> 01:45:30.704
My mother is the woman who sings.

01:45:56.101 --> 01:45:58.193
Yes, that's fine. Done.

01:46:03.374 --> 01:46:04.932
Wait for what?

01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:40.238
- Sarwan Marwan?
- Yes.

01:46:40.338 --> 01:46:42.669
We are here to offer help.

01:46:42.806 --> 01:46:45.104
You will be back in an hour.

01:46:46.342 --> 01:46:47.832
Can I tell my sister?

01:46:47.977 --> 01:46:51.003
No, you'll be back in
an hour, I promise.

01:46:52.482 --> 01:46:54.950
I'll put on a shirt, just a second.

01:46:57.752 --> 01:46:58.946
He will call.

01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:00.685
He's going to go.

01:47:01.355 --> 01:47:04.188
Ok! Do not worry, you can follow.

01:47:04.325 --> 01:47:07.761
Ah, I told you: the South,
a spark and it exploded.

01:47:07.961 --> 01:47:09.360
Oh, okay.

01:48:23.591 --> 01:48:26.855
You have been luck with us,
we'll help in our own way.

01:48:28.228 --> 01:48:29.752
You must leave the country.

01:48:29.930 --> 01:48:31.659
It'll be easier.

01:48:31.831 --> 01:48:34.265
We will find you a house and a job.

01:48:35.201 --> 01:48:38.193
I want your life to be better.

01:48:40.005 --> 01:48:42.768
We have many contacts
in America.

01:48:44.575 --> 01:48:46.770
You gotta go with your children.

01:48:47.378 --> 01:48:50.211
I know they are alive.
Take them with you.

01:48:53.383 --> 01:48:57.045
The children will help
you, you'll see.

01:49:03.858 --> 01:49:06.793
You cannot ask me.

01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:10.926
Your children are our
children, Nawal.

01:49:11.097 --> 01:49:13.224
Your family is our family.

01:49:13.732 --> 01:49:14.926
Trust me.

01:49:16.368 --> 01:49:19.303
I'll help you.

01:49:19.471 --> 01:49:22.804
I'm here for you and
your children.

01:50:12.315 --> 01:50:13.805
Hello, Sarwan.

01:50:15.952 --> 01:50:19.615
Excuse my introduction, but
it is for your protection.

01:50:21.790 --> 01:50:24.690
They call me Wallat Chamseddine.

01:50:27.093 --> 01:50:31.427
Tell me, what can I do to
help, Sarwan Marwan?

01:50:33.166 --> 01:50:34.929
You knew my mother.

01:50:35.035 --> 01:50:37.663
They say she worked for me.

01:50:37.803 --> 01:50:40.828
What can I do to help?

01:50:44.809 --> 01:50:48.142
I am looking for a
man named Nihad de Mai.

01:50:49.179 --> 01:50:51.306
Why you are looking for Nihad de Mai?

01:50:53.316 --> 01:50:54.374
He's my brother.

01:50:54.517 --> 01:50:57.008
My mother asked me to find him.

01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:00.551
And how can you prove that

01:51:00.689 --> 01:51:03.715
Nihad de Mai is the son
of Nawal Marwan?

01:51:06.495 --> 01:51:08.291
My brother was
placed for adoption

01:51:08.395 --> 01:51:10.158
at the Kfar Kout orphanage.

01:51:11.498 --> 01:51:14.467
We found the registry with
the original file.

01:51:15.468 --> 01:51:17.129
The dates ... Everything fits.

01:51:17.237 --> 01:51:19.467
Nihad de Mai is my brother.

01:52:02.707 --> 01:52:04.766
Me and my friends, we attacked

01:52:04.910 --> 01:52:07.241
the christian village at Kfar Kout ...

01:52:08.245 --> 01:52:09.712
In response to attacks

01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:12.713
that our brothers, the refugees,
were victims of.

01:52:14.350 --> 01:52:17.444
There was an orphanage
in Kfar Kout.

01:52:18.521 --> 01:52:20.580
I saved the children.

01:52:20.723 --> 01:52:22.849
I took them with us.

01:52:22.957 --> 01:52:25.858
And Nihad was among them.

01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:27.894
We have trained and prepared

01:52:28.062 --> 01:52:30.257
them so that they can fight
alongside us.

01:52:31.465 --> 01:52:33.729
Nihad, he had a gift.

01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:36.391
He was at unique.

01:52:36.569 --> 01:52:39.732
And soon it became a
formidable fencer.

01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:45.568
But he wanted to
find her mother.

01:52:45.743 --> 01:52:47.711
He sought her for a long time.

01:52:49.147 --> 01:52:52.411
Nihad, I do not know what
he saw or heard.

01:52:53.417 --> 01:52:54.907
He started ...

01:52:56.085 --> 01:52:58.417
a crazy war.

01:52:58.588 --> 01:53:02.490
He came to see me, he
wanted to be a martyr

01:53:02.625 --> 01:53:05.093
so that his mother should see
his picture everywhere

01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:06.556
on the walls around the country.

01:53:07.795 --> 01:53:09.422
But I refused.

01:53:11.332 --> 01:53:13.323
He went back to Daresh.

01:53:14.401 --> 01:53:16.562
He became a maverick,

01:53:16.669 --> 01:53:18.933
one of the most dangerous in the region.

01:53:19.105 --> 01:53:20.299
A real machine.

01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:22.304
He pulls on everyone.

01:53:22.441 --> 01:53:26.844
And then there was the
enemy invasion.

01:53:28.245 --> 01:53:29.735
And one morning ...

01:53:30.748 --> 01:53:32.682
They captured Nihad.

01:53:32.817 --> 01:53:34.614
He killed seven gunmen.

01:53:36.685 --> 01:53:38.448
They did not killed them.

01:53:38.587 --> 01:53:39.952
They captured him

01:53:40.089 --> 01:53:42.785
and sent him to the prison
in Kfar Ryat.

01:53:44.159 --> 01:53:45.854
He has been in prison?

01:53:45.995 --> 01:53:47.462
Yes.

01:53:49.831 --> 01:53:51.263
He is the executioner.

01:53:53.433 --> 01:53:55.333
He worked with my father?

01:53:55.469 --> 01:53:57.437
- No, he did not work

01:53:57.536 --> 01:53:59.470
with Abu Tarek, your father.

01:54:28.497 --> 01:54:29.964
- Are you okay?

01:54:34.634 --> 01:54:36.124
One plus one ...

01:54:37.137 --> 01:54:39.002
that makes two.

01:54:39.139 --> 01:54:40.629
What?

01:54:43.676 --> 01:54:45.735
One plus one makes two.

01:54:46.745 --> 01:54:48.235
You can not make one.

01:54:54.851 --> 01:54:56.648
Hey, you have a fever.

01:54:59.056 --> 01:55:00.546
Jeanne?

01:55:02.425 --> 01:55:05.052
One plus one, does it make one?

01:55:26.712 --> 01:55:28.577
Are there are empty seats, no.

01:55:28.714 --> 01:55:30.045
Oh, move ahead if you want.

01:56:58.822 --> 01:57:01.188
Can I help you, ma'am?

01:57:09.330 --> 01:57:11.298
Excuse me.

01:58:21.657 --> 01:58:24.023
<i>By becoming a hangman</i>

01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:26.651
<i>your brother has changed
its name.</i>

01:58:26.762 --> 01:58:29.322
<i>He became Abu Tarek.</i>

01:58:32.233 --> 01:58:35.202
<i>Nihad de Mai is Abu Tarek.</i>

01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:41.908
<i>We know that he now lives in Canada</i>

01:58:42.041 --> 01:58:44.066
<i>under a new identity.</i>

01:58:44.210 --> 01:58:46.700
<i>Nihad Harmanni.</i>

01:59:25.211 --> 01:59:26.701
Mr. Harmanni?

01:59:29.948 --> 01:59:30.915
Yes?

01:59:38.422 --> 01:59:39.912
This is for you.

02:00:25.929 --> 02:00:28.625
<i>My hand is shaking while
I am writing this.</i>

02:00:28.797 --> 02:00:30.355
<i>I recognized you.</i>

02:00:30.498 --> 02:00:33.126
<i>But you didn't.</i>

02:00:33.301 --> 02:00:35.166
<i>It's a wonderful miracle.</i>

02:00:35.303 --> 02:00:36.964
<i>I'm your number 72.</i>

02:00:37.105 --> 02:00:41.371
<i>This letter will be delivered
by our children.</i>

02:00:41.508 --> 02:00:43.498
<i>You will not recognize them</i>

02:00:43.643 --> 02:00:45.474
<i>because they are beautiful,</i>

02:00:45.645 --> 02:00:47.977
<i>but they know who you are.</i>

02:00:56.655 --> 02:00:58.884
<i>Through them, I want to tell you</i>

02:00:59.022 --> 02:01:00.990
<i>you're still alive.</i>

02:01:01.157 --> 02:01:03.148
<i>But soon, you'll be quiet.</i>

02:01:03.326 --> 02:01:04.816
<i>I know.</i>

02:01:06.162 --> 02:01:08.824
<i>Because silence is
all to the truth.</i>

02:01:09.832 --> 02:01:12.892
<i>Signed: The whore 72.</i>

02:01:26.546 --> 02:01:29.207
<i>I speak to my son.</i>

02:01:29.348 --> 02:01:31.373
<i>I am not talking to
the executioner.</i>

02:01:31.516 --> 02:01:34.485
<i>Whatever happens, I will
always love you.</i>

02:01:34.586 --> 02:01:39.819
<i>That's the promise I made you
at birth, my son.</i>

02:01:39.924 --> 02:01:43.188
<i>Whatever happens, I will
always love you.</i>

02:01:44.327 --> 02:01:46.727
<i>I've searched my whole life.</i>

02:01:46.863 --> 02:01:49.354
<i>I found you.</i>

02:01:49.499 --> 02:01:53.026
<i>You, you could not recognize me.</i>

02:01:53.201 --> 02:01:55.999
<i>You have your tattoo
on the right heel.</i>

02:01:56.104 --> 02:01:57.502
<i>I've seen it.</i>

02:01:57.605 --> 02:01:58.663
<i>I recognized you.</i>

02:02:00.174 --> 02:02:02.608
<i>And I found you beautiful.</i>

02:02:02.742 --> 02:02:06.109
<i>I'll remember you with all the
sweetness of the world, my love.</i>

02:02:06.246 --> 02:02:09.738
