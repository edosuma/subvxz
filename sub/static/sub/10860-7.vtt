00:16.280 --> 00:17.713
This way, everyone.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.959
Here we come
to a part of the prison tour

00:22.040 --> 00:25.555
which I must warn you
is not for the faint-hearted.

00:26.560 --> 00:31.998
It was here that the condemned
would spend their last night on Earth.

00:33.160 --> 00:36.789
The soul of every prisoner
to have been held in these cells

00:37.360 --> 00:40.557
is captive in these walls,

00:41.040 --> 00:43.554
the very stones around you.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.077
Yeah, you want to go to Alcatraz, mate.

00:47.040 --> 00:50.271
I wonder if anyone would care
to volunteer to spend a few moments

00:50.360 --> 00:52.555
locked in one of these cells?

00:53.680 --> 00:55.477
To get a feel for what it was like?

00:56.800 --> 00:58.119
Yeah, all right.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.553
It's said that
if you listen carefully enough,

01:14.680 --> 01:17.638
you can hear the cries
of the prisoners' torment

01:17.800 --> 01:20.268
echoing across the years.

01:58.320 --> 01:59.309
Hello?

02:00.480 --> 02:01.833
Are you okay?

03:01.080 --> 03:02.229
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.231
I thought this might
brighten the place up a bit.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.309
Thank you.

03:10.360 --> 03:12.316
Sorry about this place.

03:12.520 --> 03:13.635
It's only temporary.

03:13.720 --> 03:15.438
Well, I'm used to temporary.

03:15.520 --> 03:18.080
Once Ethan's taken care of,
you won't have to lie low any more.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.718
I'll officially exist in this time?

03:22.080 --> 03:23.069
Yeah.

03:23.880 --> 03:25.598
Lester's working on it.

03:27.440 --> 03:30.000
And once you've got a new identity,
we'll get you somewhere with a window.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.594
Somewhere more permanent.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.958
A window would be nice.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.472
Permanent will take
some getting used to.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.637
Do I look ridiculous in this?

03:51.120 --> 03:52.314
No, you look great.

03:56.920 --> 04:00.230
Ah! The Minister's
authorised all security services

04:00.320 --> 04:01.594
to track Ethan down.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.236
We can catch him ourselves.
We don't need outside help.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.676
Look, the man is a murderer
and a lunatic.

04:08.160 --> 04:11.357
The police and Ml5 are involved now.
It's outside our remit.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.749
He came through an anomaly.
That is our remit.

04:14.240 --> 04:16.470
And now that we know how he thinks,
we're best placed to find him.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.437
- Listen...
- Just get me access

04:18.519 --> 04:20.909
to the evidence from the apartment,
buy me some time

04:21.000 --> 04:22.353
and I guarantee you we'll find him.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.593
That way, we've cleaned up our own mess

04:24.680 --> 04:26.159
and you're back
on the Minister's Christmas card list.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.992
Fine, fine, fine.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.877
You've got till the end of the day.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.598
I can't hold them off
any longer than that.

04:37.440 --> 04:40.876
So, this is where it all happens.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.239
This is my desk.

04:43.880 --> 04:44.915
- It's a little bit...
- Messy.

04:46.080 --> 04:49.311
Yep, "messy" would be
the word for it, right now.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.275
You know, it's good.

04:52.480 --> 04:56.632
I mean, I suppose it's your average
work-surface area, really.

04:57.520 --> 04:58.509
Mmm-hmm.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.353
I never know what that does.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.317
- What's this.
- Huh?

05:03.400 --> 05:05.391
- What's this?
- Ah.

05:06.560 --> 05:07.879
That's a dating calculator.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.510
- What?
- Oh, no, no.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.352
Not that kind of dating.

05:14.400 --> 05:18.029
It... It tells you
where the anomalies lead to.

05:18.120 --> 05:20.031
And that means what exact year.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.511
All you've got to do
is point it and press.

05:23.680 --> 05:24.999
You made this?

05:27.120 --> 05:28.678
My first project for Philip.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.274
- That's really cool, Connor.
- It certainly is.

05:38.960 --> 05:40.871
Oh, Philip, here. The anomalies,

05:40.960 --> 05:42.757
they're definitely
getting more frequent.

05:42.840 --> 05:44.159
- Oh, Connor.
- I should go.

05:44.240 --> 05:46.276
Don't take this the wrong way,

05:46.360 --> 05:49.511
but not everything we do here
will concern the ARC team.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.589
Yeah, I know.

05:50.680 --> 05:53.478
So, from now on, we can consider
this lab as being part of Prospero

05:53.560 --> 05:55.755
and off-limits to everyone else.

05:56.840 --> 05:59.195
- Part of Prospero. Check.
- Good.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.877
Secure the perimeter. You two with me.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.151
There was nowhere he could have gone.
I locked and bolted the cell myself.

06:24.680 --> 06:25.908
Okay.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.116
This way, please, ladies and gentlemen.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.591
The museum will reopen
as soon as possible.

06:32.520 --> 06:33.509
Thanks.

06:35.840 --> 06:36.829
Absolutely nothing.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.230
Connor?
- Yup.

06:54.480 --> 06:57.358
There's no sign of a creature attack.

06:57.440 --> 06:58.589
- Really?
- Yeah, the door was locked,

06:58.680 --> 06:59.749
nothing could've got in it.

07:00.600 --> 07:01.794
- That's weird.
- Hmm.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.031
And we only registered one anomaly
and that's this one.

07:05.440 --> 07:06.589
We searched the entire building,

07:06.680 --> 07:08.193
and there's no other sign
of an incursion.

07:10.120 --> 07:11.394
I don't get it.

07:15.160 --> 07:18.072
There's something I don't understand
about Ethan.

07:18.680 --> 07:20.318
You said something's
going to happen with the gateways

07:20.400 --> 07:22.755
and that he's involved. But how?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.639
If I'm right,
he's going to try to use them,

07:28.720 --> 07:29.835
change them somehow.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.797
But I always assumed
they're a natural force,

07:31.880 --> 07:33.074
like the weather.

07:33.160 --> 07:34.195
How could someone change them?

07:34.520 --> 07:37.318
The technology exists in this time
to change almost anything.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.277
Right now, here, is crucial.

07:39.360 --> 07:41.669
We have all of the abilities
and all of the tools,

07:42.560 --> 07:44.437
and all the wisdom to use them safely.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.872
I'm growing old here, Connor.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.551
How long does it take to get a date
from this thing?

07:55.960 --> 07:57.678
Okay, I'm getting something.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.231
Looks like 1870-ish.

08:06.880 --> 08:07.869
Ish?

08:09.840 --> 08:11.876
You left home in 1867, right?

08:12.360 --> 08:13.395
Yes.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.590
I think we found an anomaly
back to your time.

08:19.480 --> 08:20.469
Excuse me.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.229
Connor, are you sure?

08:27.600 --> 08:28.669
Trust the technology, Matt.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.193
<i>If that's what is says,
then that's what it...</i>

08:32.120 --> 08:33.633
- What happened?
- No idea.

08:33.799 --> 08:35.552
Connor, time to turn your toy off.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.674
It won't have anything to do with this.

08:36.760 --> 08:39.513
- Turn it off now!
- Becker, it leads to the Victorian era.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.759
What do you think
is going to come through?

08:41.840 --> 08:42.989
Oliver Twistasaurus?

08:45.360 --> 08:46.349
Fine.

08:58.560 --> 08:59.959
There must be a problem
with the locking mechanism.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.075
Can you fix it?

09:06.840 --> 09:07.955
Get back!

09:09.680 --> 09:10.715
Maintain a low charge.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.111
Let's try and scare it back through.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.074
If that's what I think it was,

09:33.160 --> 09:36.914
then your calculator's only,
what, a few million years out?

09:41.120 --> 09:43.759
Jess, we're going to need
backup down here right now.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.153
I'll get right on it, Becker.

09:51.720 --> 09:52.709
Who is it?

09:56.200 --> 09:59.431
Emily, I'm sorry, but that anomaly
doesn't lead back to your home.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.719
Jess shouldn't have said anything
till we were certain.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.510
Jess, I can't find a fault
with this locking mechanism.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.828
You're going to have to send me
another one down.

10:35.920 --> 10:36.909
On its way.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.029
Thanks.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.949
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.880
Wind-up radio, generates its own power.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.757
I know what it is.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.353
We used one to find gateways.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.554
So you're telling me Ethan tuned it in
to the frequency of the anomalies?

11:09.440 --> 11:10.475
Jess!

11:10.560 --> 11:11.959
Ethan has a way to track anomalies.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.996
Warn the others
he might be on his way to the prison.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.399
I'm heading there now.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.992
No. It's likely that he thinks
you're dead already,

11:18.080 --> 11:19.229
so you're safer here.

11:19.320 --> 11:20.469
- He's my responsibility.
- If you're there,

11:21.160 --> 11:23.754
I'll just be worrying about you
and not about him.

11:24.080 --> 11:26.753
My father warned me
that you'd be a distraction.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.239
Please, just...

12:03.880 --> 12:06.519
Ethan could be armed.
You two stay down here.

12:09.280 --> 12:11.953
Connor, stay with the anomaly.
Abby, you're with me.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.513
Well, what if the...

12:23.600 --> 12:25.795
We double-checked. The place was clear.

12:25.880 --> 12:26.949
I know.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.035
Becker.

12:41.480 --> 12:43.550
How on earth
did the ARC not pick this up?

12:52.320 --> 12:55.790
Jess, we've got a ptero-bird
and another anomaly in a store room.

12:56.040 --> 12:58.600
I'm only registering the first anomaly.
Are you sure?

12:59.280 --> 13:01.840
Yes, Jess. Pretty sure.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.430
One, two...

13:24.920 --> 13:26.512
Okay, spread out. You know what to do.

13:30.680 --> 13:31.829
Any sign of Ethan?

13:31.920 --> 13:34.514
No, but Matt, we've got
a seriously weird anomaly.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.589
- Show me.
- Okay.

13:44.720 --> 13:47.109
At first, Becker thought
my dating calculator was interfering.

13:47.280 --> 13:49.794
But the replacement mechanism,
that didn't lock the anomaly, either.

13:50.320 --> 13:52.675
This is like nothing
we've ever dealt with before.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.354
And the anomaly we found in
the store room, it didn't look normal.

13:55.640 --> 13:57.153
It was paler, not as strong.

13:57.240 --> 13:59.674
That can't have been open long because
Becker searched the cells, right?

13:59.760 --> 14:02.274
Yeah. If they're coming
and going quickly,

14:02.360 --> 14:04.430
it would explain
how the tourist disappeared earlier.

14:04.680 --> 14:05.669
Connor,

14:06.760 --> 14:07.875
is there anything to indicate

14:07.960 --> 14:09.678
that someone might have
manipulated this anomaly,

14:09.760 --> 14:10.795
like interfered with it?

14:11.440 --> 14:13.192
Interfering? How?

14:14.240 --> 14:15.355
I mean, there was nobody in the room

14:15.440 --> 14:16.839
when we arrived,
if that's what you mean.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.075
Not again.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.755
Don't shoot.
I think it wants to go through.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.794
Becker, check for anomalies.
We've got an incursion.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.710
- That was the same bird.
- Really?

14:40.280 --> 14:41.918
Yeah. Scar.

14:42.080 --> 14:45.117
Well, that'd mean the anomaly you saw
must be part of this one.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.189
How does that work?

14:48.240 --> 14:49.468
Move! It's coming back through!

15:09.360 --> 15:10.349
- Danny.
- Danny.

15:16.840 --> 15:17.875
Danny.

15:18.280 --> 15:20.430
Danny, it's Abby. Can you hear me?

15:20.880 --> 15:23.348
- You're back.
- I can't believe you shot him.

15:23.440 --> 15:24.953
He's been away over a year

15:25.040 --> 15:27.190
and he finally makes it back
and you just...

15:27.280 --> 15:29.953
Sorry. He'll be okay,
it was on its lowest setting.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.789
- Danny.
- Come on, Quinn. Get up. Stop faking.

15:32.880 --> 15:33.869
Becker.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.189
Becker?

15:36.840 --> 15:39.559
Wow, Becker. You're much cuter
than I remember.

15:42.880 --> 15:45.713
Oh, God!
All right, sunshine?

15:47.080 --> 15:48.069
Come here.

15:49.720 --> 15:52.029
Sorry.
- God, what was that?

15:52.880 --> 15:54.552
Matt shot you.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.473
- Yeah?
- Matt likes to shoot people.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.399
So you'd be Matt, then.

15:59.480 --> 16:02.358
Matt Anderson. Sorry, mate,
you'll be okay in a couple of hours.

16:03.240 --> 16:04.878
I'm really back, aren't I?

16:05.800 --> 16:08.553
- Never thought I'd see you again.
- We waited for you. What happened?

16:08.640 --> 16:11.871
- Where were you?
- Well, you know, here and there.

16:12.480 --> 16:13.959
Mostly through there.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.151
Look, guys,
Ethan could show up any minute.

16:18.880 --> 16:21.553
Abby, take Danny back to the ARC.
Connor, keep trying to lock that thing.

16:21.640 --> 16:22.959
Becker, come with me.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.753
What's going on?

16:25.840 --> 16:28.513
Well, it's a long story. We're kind of
in the middle of something serious.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.034
So, nothing changes, then.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.637
Matt, guard down. Ethan's in.

17:02.360 --> 17:03.998
Careful. Don't move too quickly.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.396
- So, did you two end up, um...
What?

17:08.760 --> 17:09.749
You know...

17:12.040 --> 17:13.189
Ethan's in the building.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.593
Don't move Danny till I say.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.796
Whatever happens,
we can't let Ethan near that anomaly.

17:18.880 --> 17:23.157
Matt. Ethan's using radio frequencies
to locate the anomalies, right?

17:23.480 --> 17:24.469
Yeah.

17:25.319 --> 17:27.117
Then we can tell exactly where he is.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.189
How?

17:57.200 --> 17:58.758
Right, so what are we listening for?

17:59.600 --> 18:01.158
Connor says we'll know it
when we hear it.

18:03.360 --> 18:04.349
If I could just...

18:07.520 --> 18:08.555
All right, stand by.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.115
Here goes.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.589
Okay, he's upstairs.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.595
Oh, uh, you going to be okay?

18:29.760 --> 18:31.830
- Do your thing.
- It's good to have you back.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.397
Connor, Abby, cover the ground floor.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.155
Guys, take cover!

19:26.480 --> 19:27.595
You two take the bird.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.355
- Hold up.
- What?

20:31.000 --> 20:32.149
It's close.

20:38.640 --> 20:39.629
Stop running, Ethan!

20:41.800 --> 20:43.358
There's nowhere to go!

20:46.600 --> 20:48.909
Okay. On three.

20:49.520 --> 20:52.239
One, two...

20:55.120 --> 20:58.157
It's in here. Let me introduce you

20:59.440 --> 21:01.158
- to Molly.
- Molly?

21:04.160 --> 21:05.149
Hang on.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.469
You named your stick?

21:08.560 --> 21:12.553
Listen. It was just me and
those ptero-birds for six months.

21:12.640 --> 21:15.313
Believe me, you start naming things.

21:29.360 --> 21:30.349
Don't move!

21:31.400 --> 21:33.231
You're going round in circles, Ethan.

21:33.320 --> 21:35.072
- Drop the gun.
- Tell me where the gateway is.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.469
Drop the gun or I'll drop you!

21:44.360 --> 21:45.475
Tell me where the gateway is.

21:45.880 --> 21:47.598
- Drop the gun.
- Where's the gateway?

21:48.120 --> 21:49.235
Why? What have you done to it?

21:50.800 --> 21:52.836
- Done to it?
- I know you've messed with it. Why?

21:52.920 --> 21:53.955
What are you trying to achieve?

21:55.800 --> 21:57.552
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- It's over, Ethan!

21:57.640 --> 21:59.551
- Just tell me what the plan was.
- There's no plan!

22:03.200 --> 22:05.270
I thought I wanted to stay
in this world.

22:06.120 --> 22:08.634
I don't. I was wrong.

22:45.520 --> 22:48.432
Oi! Big Bird!

23:09.120 --> 23:11.554
Let me go through the gateway
and you'll never see me again.

23:22.680 --> 23:24.352
- Matt!
- This way!

23:33.560 --> 23:35.835
Whoa. Okay.

23:37.800 --> 23:40.234
Yeah, all right. Just...

23:55.760 --> 23:56.749
Danny.

24:02.560 --> 24:03.675
Patrick.

24:06.600 --> 24:07.589
Patrick?

24:11.800 --> 24:13.199
It's all right. It's all right.

24:14.400 --> 24:15.389
He's his brother.

24:18.720 --> 24:21.712
Give me two minutes with him, Becker.
Just two minutes, please!

24:21.800 --> 24:24.075
I'm sorry. Matt doesn't want anyone
talking to him.

24:26.240 --> 24:28.310
Look, I promise I'll let you
see him later, all right?

24:28.760 --> 24:29.749
Patrick.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.517
Ah! Quinn.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.511
What an unexpected pleasure.

24:39.320 --> 24:40.309
That's my brother in there.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.391
Look, why can't I talk to him?
What's going on?

24:42.480 --> 24:43.469
Not here. Come on.

24:44.080 --> 24:45.069
My office.

24:48.040 --> 24:51.919
- So, Helen Cutter, dead?
- As a dodo.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.229
Excellent.

24:54.600 --> 24:57.398
How do we know that Patrick's
done all this stuff? I mean,

24:57.680 --> 24:59.750
he could just be using
this guy Ethan's name.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.117
What do we actually know that he's done?

25:02.560 --> 25:03.913
Since Patrick's been here,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.275
he's murdered one person
and attempted to kill two others.

25:10.760 --> 25:11.909
This can't be right.

25:13.480 --> 25:15.072
He wasjust a boy when he went through.

25:16.880 --> 25:18.108
What happened to him?

25:18.760 --> 25:20.079
We don't know.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.349
We don't know.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.034
You said you could do anything

25:29.120 --> 25:30.712
and that we didn't understand
the anomalies,

25:30.800 --> 25:31.789
what did you mean?

25:35.280 --> 25:36.713
You said you were the future.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.439
"I am the past. I am the present.
I am the future. " What does that mean?

25:39.600 --> 25:41.750
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

25:41.920 --> 25:42.909
No.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.397
How long is it since you first
went through an anomaly?

25:48.280 --> 25:49.395
Eighteen years.

25:51.600 --> 25:52.749
So you were just a boy.

25:53.840 --> 25:54.955
Fourteen.

25:55.640 --> 25:58.074
I was all alone in that world
with those things.

26:02.280 --> 26:05.829
Every day I waited
for him to come and rescue me,

26:06.520 --> 26:07.669
and he never did.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.149
Who, Danny?

26:14.040 --> 26:15.268
So this is all about your brother?

26:15.360 --> 26:16.679
He's not my brother.

26:18.280 --> 26:19.269
Not any more.

26:21.160 --> 26:23.833
So this has nothing to do
with the anomalies?

26:23.920 --> 26:25.876
This is just because you wanted
to punish Danny?

26:26.080 --> 26:27.877
Why are you so interested in me?

26:29.400 --> 26:31.038
I thought you were somebody else,

26:32.720 --> 26:33.994
but I was wrong.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.029
Right.

26:49.160 --> 26:51.469
That should hold him
until you figure out what's going on

26:51.560 --> 26:53.312
and we can send him back home for good.

26:53.400 --> 26:54.833
If I figure out what's going on.

26:57.080 --> 26:58.069
You will.

26:59.240 --> 27:01.834
I'll do another circuit, make sure
nothing else has popped through.

27:01.920 --> 27:02.909
Cool.

27:03.240 --> 27:04.229
Right...

27:05.280 --> 27:07.077
Okay, well it won't lock,

27:07.560 --> 27:10.120
and somehow it's projecting
satellite anomalies,

27:11.320 --> 27:12.753
weaker versions of itself.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.231
Connor, you need to come
and see this now.

27:44.600 --> 27:45.999
Look at them.

27:46.640 --> 27:47.675
What?

27:51.400 --> 27:52.389
Connor,

27:53.080 --> 27:54.559
start from the beginning.

27:55.280 --> 27:56.952
- What do we know?
- Okay, we showed up,

27:57.040 --> 27:58.678
the tourist was missing.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.432
I got the wrong date
and the anomaly wouldn't lock.

28:00.520 --> 28:01.509
Okay.

28:03.080 --> 28:04.069
Come with me.

28:06.320 --> 28:07.309
Matt?

28:09.040 --> 28:10.712
Did he tell you what he's going to do?

28:11.440 --> 28:12.429
Matt!

28:13.240 --> 28:14.514
Talk to me. What happened in there?

28:14.600 --> 28:15.749
Why do you care?

28:16.600 --> 28:17.589
Pardon?

28:17.720 --> 28:20.075
Why are you so interested in Ethan
and what I'm doing here?

28:20.920 --> 28:22.512
Matt, are you accusing me of something?

28:23.800 --> 28:24.915
It's not Ethan.

28:26.680 --> 28:28.318
He's not the one. I was so certain.

28:29.960 --> 28:30.949
So what...

28:31.760 --> 28:32.954
What, you suspect me, now?

28:33.040 --> 28:34.268
No.

28:34.360 --> 28:35.839
I don't know.
Look, it could be anybody now.

28:35.920 --> 28:37.399
It could be Danny, for all I know.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.473
If you were wrong about Ethan,
you could be wrong about everything.

28:40.560 --> 28:43.358
How can you be so sure this event with
the anomalies is even going to happen?

28:43.440 --> 28:44.589
It just is.

28:46.040 --> 28:47.029
I know it is.

28:49.920 --> 28:51.273
Well, it doesn't make sense.

29:03.760 --> 29:05.318
Danny, pleasure to meet you.

29:05.920 --> 29:06.955
Philip Burton.

29:08.560 --> 29:09.549
Hmm.

29:09.720 --> 29:10.948
My company
were invited by the government

29:11.040 --> 29:12.792
to come and help
with the ARC operation.

29:13.840 --> 29:17.355
James Lester tells me you saw
Helen Cutter die.

29:17.440 --> 29:18.429
Yeah.

29:19.880 --> 29:20.915
Did you kill her?

29:21.000 --> 29:23.594
I imagine you may not
have had much choice.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.388
Well, strictly speaking, it was
a combination between a raptor

29:26.480 --> 29:29.040
and a steep cliff that
finally finished her off but, um...

29:30.160 --> 29:31.229
Did you know her?

29:31.440 --> 29:32.429
No.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.075
Although I've heard a lot about her.

29:34.160 --> 29:36.435
It's just your name was written all over
a document that she had with her.

29:37.320 --> 29:39.550
- Really? Interesting.
- Yeah.

29:39.840 --> 29:40.829
In what context?

29:40.920 --> 29:43.115
It was a list of questions
about anomalies,

29:43.760 --> 29:45.512
like your opinion mattered to her.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.397
Well, at the risk of sounding conceited,

29:47.480 --> 29:50.950
my opinion on a range of issues matters
to a lot of important people,

29:51.040 --> 29:52.155
especially other scientists.

29:52.240 --> 29:53.958
It'sjust anomalies
aren't just any old issue, are they?

29:54.040 --> 29:55.029
Helen Cutter...

29:55.120 --> 29:57.111
Helen Cutter just isn't
any old scientist.

29:57.320 --> 30:00.039
<i>...was an unbalanced individual.</i>

30:01.160 --> 30:02.752
Who knows what she was thinking?

30:07.000 --> 30:09.833
I trust you're being well looked after?

30:10.400 --> 30:13.039
And if there's anything, you know,
I can get you, anything you need,

30:13.760 --> 30:15.398
don't hesitate to ask.

30:19.080 --> 30:20.911
You can speak to him now.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.033
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

30:26.960 --> 30:28.109
James.

30:32.680 --> 30:34.113
We should tread carefully.

30:34.560 --> 30:35.879
Danny seems...

30:36.400 --> 30:38.277
erratic to me,

30:38.360 --> 30:40.112
a little unbalanced.

30:40.720 --> 30:43.314
It must have been rough
out there on his own so long.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.429
Yeah.

30:46.600 --> 30:48.955
- I'll keep an eye on him.
- Good.

31:03.080 --> 31:04.832
Not a single day went by

31:04.920 --> 31:06.956
when I didn't think
about what happened,

31:07.760 --> 31:09.273
about where you'd gone.

31:10.640 --> 31:11.629
Patrick...

31:19.280 --> 31:22.556
Patrick, look at me, please.

31:28.040 --> 31:30.156
- You abandoned me.
- No.

31:31.320 --> 31:33.880
Everything that I have done
since the day you disappeared

31:33.960 --> 31:35.837
has been about getting you back.

31:35.920 --> 31:38.514
The police force,
joining the ARC, everything.

31:38.920 --> 31:40.672
- Shut up.
- I've never given up on you,

31:41.600 --> 31:43.079
and I'm not about to start now.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.315
Okay.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.870
- You ready?
- Ready.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.189
Now.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.273
Wow. Okay.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.028
Two anomalies.

32:13.880 --> 32:16.110
Two anomalies opening
in exactly the same spot,

32:16.880 --> 32:19.110
and they act like magnets.

32:19.440 --> 32:22.432
They try and repel one another
but they can't because they're fused.

32:23.600 --> 32:26.239
But all that generated energy,
that has to go somewhere,

32:26.320 --> 32:29.278
so satellite anomalies
are opening instead.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.191
But now these anomalies have separated,

32:32.280 --> 32:34.191
the satellite anomalies
should cease to exist.

32:34.800 --> 32:36.791
So these two anomalies
lead to different places.

32:42.440 --> 32:43.429
Pliocene.

32:52.600 --> 32:53.589
1867.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.755
It worked all along.

32:57.840 --> 32:58.829
Two anomalies.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.716
In exactly the same spot.

33:02.640 --> 33:04.835
- What are the chances of that happening?
- Tiny.

33:10.760 --> 33:11.749
Come on.

33:15.800 --> 33:17.836
Jess, we're coming back to the ARC.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.555
I need you to bring up every bit of
anomaly data that we have,

33:20.640 --> 33:23.200
going way back,
and I mean absolutely everything.

33:23.400 --> 33:26.153
And, Jess,
tell Emily that Connor was right.

33:38.320 --> 33:43.030
It's 1867.
Connor's sure this time. He promised.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.632
I thought this would be good news?

33:51.040 --> 33:53.349
It is. Thank you.

33:59.480 --> 34:02.552
I'm sure if you wanted to stay,
it would be okay.

34:03.720 --> 34:04.835
Do you want to stay?

34:05.560 --> 34:07.357
I wish I knew what I wanted.

34:07.920 --> 34:10.195
The person I was three years ago,

34:12.199 --> 34:14.668
a new bride who went
to investigate the golden light

34:14.760 --> 34:16.273
and fell into another world,

34:18.880 --> 34:20.029
it's not me any more.

34:24.520 --> 34:27.159
But it seems
I don't quite fit here, either.

34:41.360 --> 34:42.952
All those things that you did.

34:45.239 --> 34:46.592
They told me about you.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.109
What happened to you?

34:59.440 --> 35:03.069
At first I had to kill to survive.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.953
Those creatures, they kept coming.

35:08.840 --> 35:09.829
I got good at it.

35:11.400 --> 35:14.119
Killing. Really good.

35:15.600 --> 35:17.352
After a while, you start to enjoy it.

35:17.600 --> 35:21.229
Killing animals in self-defence,
I get it. But Patrick,

35:22.440 --> 35:23.429
humans?

35:23.720 --> 35:25.790
- They're only animals.
- No.

35:27.240 --> 35:29.549
They are. We are.

35:32.080 --> 35:33.195
Why are humans different?

35:34.960 --> 35:35.949
This isn't you, Patrick.

35:36.800 --> 35:37.949
It isn't you.

35:41.960 --> 35:42.949
No, it is.

35:45.040 --> 35:47.031
And I thought about killing you
every day.

35:51.080 --> 35:52.195
Danny,

35:53.440 --> 35:54.509
take me to the gateway

35:55.360 --> 35:57.749
and I promise you'll never
see me again. No one will.

35:57.880 --> 36:00.440
- I can't do that.
- Please.

36:01.840 --> 36:02.875
I just want to be alone.

36:12.480 --> 36:15.517
No. You don't have to do this.

36:16.160 --> 36:18.799
Please. Listen to me.

36:24.920 --> 36:25.909
Bro.

36:47.240 --> 36:48.389
Sorry.

36:57.560 --> 37:00.233
Intruder alert. All units to Corridor 5.

37:12.760 --> 37:13.795
Hey!

37:13.880 --> 37:17.509
Ethan! Or Patrick!
Or whatever your name is.

37:18.840 --> 37:23.277
Lower your weapon slowly
and get down on the ground now. Now!

37:26.880 --> 37:30.589
Okay. Just don't harm her, okay?

37:31.720 --> 37:32.709
I won't.

37:54.320 --> 37:55.878
He's taken one of the 4x4s.

37:55.960 --> 37:58.110
- He's going back to the prison.
- Let's go.

38:07.760 --> 38:08.749
Tell me how to open them.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.832
I told you, I don't know how.

38:13.600 --> 38:15.431
You go through that gateway,
and on the other side

38:15.520 --> 38:18.159
you'll be exactly the same person
as you are now.

38:39.240 --> 38:41.196
Ethan, don't do this.

38:45.520 --> 38:46.509
Goodbye.

39:29.640 --> 39:32.074
Nice. You said she was good.

39:54.600 --> 39:55.715
Pliocene.

39:58.080 --> 39:59.832
You going to go after him?

40:00.120 --> 40:02.190
I can't risk him going through
to another human time.

40:02.760 --> 40:04.432
I won't leave him alone.

40:05.680 --> 40:09.275
Look, I don't know if I can trust you
but it looks like I've got no choice.

40:13.360 --> 40:16.079
Philip Burton is connected
to Helen Cutter.

40:17.080 --> 40:18.274
They knew each other.

40:18.920 --> 40:21.753
He lied to me about it,
something to do with anomaly research.

40:22.920 --> 40:26.230
Will you let the others know
that Burton is not to be trusted?

40:32.240 --> 40:33.355
Oh, my God.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.189
Philip!

40:37.200 --> 40:39.555
Look, you go after your brother,
I'll take care of this.

40:46.440 --> 40:47.555
Danny.

40:49.200 --> 40:50.189
Good luck.

40:51.640 --> 40:53.392
Say goodbye to Abby and Connor
for me, will you?

40:54.320 --> 40:56.754
And, oi.
I've not forgotten that you shot me.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.513
I'll get you back for that one day.

41:09.280 --> 41:11.111
- Where's Philip?
He'sjust left.

41:16.080 --> 41:17.115
Thanks, yeah.

41:25.360 --> 41:27.157
I thought perhaps I'd tell you
I would stay.

41:29.840 --> 41:31.478
If you asked me to,

41:32.680 --> 41:33.795
I'd let this close.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.479
That would be the end of it.

41:38.600 --> 41:40.716
But you've got this immense thing
you have to do.

41:45.280 --> 41:46.759
Philip! Don't!

41:47.160 --> 41:48.434
I don't belong here.

41:50.120 --> 41:51.519
And neither do you.

41:54.480 --> 41:56.630
You came through a gateway
of your own, didn't you?

41:59.000 --> 42:00.956
From where? The future?

42:02.240 --> 42:04.276
Everything there is
either dead or dying.

42:05.560 --> 42:07.312
We exist underground

42:07.400 --> 42:09.550
because the surface of the planet
can't sustain life any more.

42:11.600 --> 42:12.715
It's sterile

42:14.840 --> 42:16.592
because of something mankind did.

42:19.600 --> 42:20.669
We destroyed it.

42:22.080 --> 42:23.274
Stop! Stop!

42:26.720 --> 42:27.789
Connor?

42:27.880 --> 42:29.154
What did we do?

42:29.240 --> 42:30.355
I don't know yet.

42:31.240 --> 42:32.593
What on earth is going on?

42:33.640 --> 42:37.189
A few of us have been sent back to
different times to try to prevent it.

42:38.120 --> 42:39.439
My father as well.

42:39.960 --> 42:42.599
Get your breath back
and talk me through it.

42:43.800 --> 42:45.677
And all of this has got to do
with the anomalies?

42:46.160 --> 42:48.230
I said the anomalies
were growing more frequent.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.269
I was right.

42:51.440 --> 42:53.908
- Something interferes with them?
- Someone.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.394
Someone interferes with them.

42:56.560 --> 42:58.073
I did some projections

42:58.160 --> 43:00.390
of what would happen if the anomalies
kept growing at this rate.

43:00.480 --> 43:01.469
What will happen?

43:03.520 --> 43:04.509
It'd be catastrophic.

43:05.760 --> 43:07.955
Soon, and I mean really soon,

43:08.600 --> 43:10.909
anomalies willjust start
to open up everywhere.

43:12.360 --> 43:14.112
Thousands of them.
Tens of thousands of them.

43:14.320 --> 43:16.231
Unless I stop him, that's it.

43:16.960 --> 43:18.632
The end of all life on this planet.

43:18.920 --> 43:22.151
And they wouldn't stop, they'd just keep
multiplying and multiplying, until...

43:22.640 --> 43:23.709
Until?

43:24.520 --> 43:25.635
I don't know.

43:26.240 --> 43:27.275
I will stop him.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.029
But you have to go.

43:34.520 --> 43:36.829
I can't let anything else
matter any more.

43:45.200 --> 43:46.235
Come on.

43:49.160 --> 43:51.116
We have to think of a way
to respond to this.

43:51.680 --> 43:55.673
But most importantly,
we have to keep this to ourselves.

43:56.080 --> 43:57.069
For now.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.552
You do trust me, don't you?

44:34.000 --> 44:35.069
Yeah, I trust you.

44:36.600 --> 44:37.589
Good.

44:40.240 --> 44:41.229
Get in.

44:41.920 --> 44:43.638
We have a lot to discuss.

44:44.305 --> 44:50.550
