01:34.457 --> 01:35.832
Brenda, we have to choose a scene.

01:36.001 --> 01:37.910
What about a scene
from Annie Hall?

01:38.129 --> 01:41.380
l look good in hats. lt takes
a certain person to look good in a hat.

01:41.550 --> 01:43.044
Well, you've got Diane Keaton's hat,

01:43.219 --> 01:46.339
but l'm not playing Woody Allen
just because l wear glasses.

01:46.515 --> 01:49.006
Well, l don't see you making
any other suggestions.

01:49.227 --> 01:51.386
Brenda, you're Mr. Suiter's pet.

01:51.563 --> 01:53.306
l have never performed
in this class before.

01:53.482 --> 01:55.356
l have to do well in order to pass.

01:56.945 --> 01:58.902
What makes you think l'm his pet?

01:59.115 --> 02:00.740
lt's just obvious.

02:00.950 --> 02:03.276
- What is?
- That he likes you.

02:03.996 --> 02:06.036
- You think so?
- l just said it, okay?

02:06.249 --> 02:09.701
Now, can we please--
Please can we choose a scene?

02:11.631 --> 02:14.087
You really think he likes me?

02:14.260 --> 02:16.586
Brenda, he's a teacher.

02:17.347 --> 02:20.717
Andrea, consider the possibilities.

02:22.437 --> 02:27.100
He's creative, he's articulate,
he's intelligent,

02:27.277 --> 02:29.733
and he looks pretty good
in faded jeans.

02:29.947 --> 02:32.106
Brenda, he's our teacher.

02:32.326 --> 02:35.446
Not for long.
Summer school gets out next week.

03:10.251 --> 03:12.327
You know, l think it's starting
to get dark earlier.

03:12.504 --> 03:14.876
- lt is not. You're just totally paranoid.
- No, l'm not.

03:15.049 --> 03:17.089
Everywhere l go,
there are back-to-school sales.

03:17.260 --> 03:19.882
Look, l don't wanna hear it, okay?

03:20.056 --> 03:21.847
- What's that?
- lt's nothing.

03:22.017 --> 03:24.224
- What is that?
- lt's no big deal.

03:24.395 --> 03:27.396
l just start to get a little eczema when
Labour Day looms on the horizon.

03:27.607 --> 03:29.018
Summer's about over, isn't it?

03:29.193 --> 03:31.269
So, what can l get
for you two crazy kids, huh?

03:31.446 --> 03:34.364
How about a gin and tonic,
crushed ice, twist of lime?

03:34.575 --> 03:36.817
- Nice try, guy.
- Well, it's official.

03:36.995 --> 03:38.869
The end of summer luau
is next weekend.

03:39.039 --> 03:41.910
Yeah, pretty soon l'll be fighting over
a parking spot at West Beverly.

03:42.085 --> 03:46.036
No, we'll be fighting over parking spots.
l've almost got enough for my 'Stang.

03:46.257 --> 03:47.502
That '65 'Stang?

03:47.717 --> 03:50.635
Supremely yellow in mint condition.

03:50.805 --> 03:54.471
And this should put you over the top.

03:56.729 --> 03:57.892
l'm so there.

03:59.733 --> 04:03.434
You know, when l got my '57 Bird,
l became my own man.

04:03.655 --> 04:06.360
When you are cruising
in your dream car,

04:06.534 --> 04:08.741
it's a whole new road out there.

04:08.912 --> 04:11.450
Yeah, my road.

04:11.666 --> 04:14.667
- l'll see you, guys.
- All right, man.

04:17.214 --> 04:18.709
Stop it.

04:29.732 --> 04:31.606
l know, my--

04:31.776 --> 04:33.733
l know, my dear.

04:33.904 --> 04:35.398
l know, my dear.

04:35.614 --> 04:39.031
l know, my--
Oh, l know, my dear. l know-- No.

04:39.202 --> 04:41.076
- l know--
- Andrea Zuckerman,

04:41.247 --> 04:42.990
browsing in a bookstore.

04:43.166 --> 04:45.075
Mr. Suiter doing the same.

04:46.128 --> 04:48.750
You know, it seems a little unfair
that l can call you Andrea

04:48.924 --> 04:50.632
but you can't call me Chris.

04:50.843 --> 04:52.634
Student-teacher dynamics, l guess.

04:52.804 --> 04:54.963
Let's say we change our dynamics,
right here and now.

04:55.432 --> 05:00.641
We'll have our own
private revolution, Andrea.

05:01.357 --> 05:04.027
Okay, Chris.

05:08.450 --> 05:11.985
The entire car has been
completely detailed and rechromed.

05:12.163 --> 05:14.619
lt's got the original paint,
the original leather seats,

05:14.791 --> 05:15.989
the original radio.

05:16.168 --> 05:17.331
But how does she run, son?

05:17.503 --> 05:20.789
Well, the guy at the lot said she purrs
like a kitten and runs like a cheetah.

05:21.300 --> 05:22.842
Sounds pretty good.

05:23.011 --> 05:25.633
How about if l go into work
a little late this morning?

05:25.806 --> 05:27.929
We can pick her up together.

05:28.309 --> 05:30.681
Oh, l don't wanna put you out, Dad.

05:31.105 --> 05:32.848
lt would be a father-son adventure.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.736
l still have to swing by the bank
and pick up the cashier's cheque

05:35.903 --> 05:38.821
- before l can go pick it up, so it--
- Cashier's cheque?

05:38.990 --> 05:41.232
Brandon, if they don't trust
a personal cheque from you,

05:41.410 --> 05:43.319
l wouldn't be too confident
about trusting them.

05:43.496 --> 05:46.497
Hey, Dad, this isn't Minnesota.
Besides, what's the big deal?

05:46.709 --> 05:48.334
Simon's been holding the car
all summer.

05:48.545 --> 05:50.039
- Brandon--
- And since l'm buying it

05:50.213 --> 05:53.167
with my own money that l worked
very hard for, l think it'll be cool.

05:55.053 --> 05:56.084
l hope so.

05:56.513 --> 05:57.758
Good morning.

05:59.351 --> 06:02.305
Oh, while you were in the shower,
Hawaii called.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.058
Thanks, Mom.

06:05.609 --> 06:06.772
Dylan McKay
calls from Hawaii,

06:06.944 --> 06:09.862
and Brenda doesn't scream at you
for not dragging her out of the shower?

06:10.031 --> 06:12.949
Poor Dylan. l guess
it's out of sight, out of mind.

06:13.161 --> 06:16.198
Listen, Dad, about the car, l--

06:16.373 --> 06:19.577
l think it's just something
l ought to do on my own, all right?

06:19.753 --> 06:21.662
Yeah, l understand.

06:33.104 --> 06:35.311
lt's about these two women
and their dynamics together.

06:35.482 --> 06:38.104
How their lives intersected,
their relationships with men.

06:38.319 --> 06:40.228
l don't wanna intersect.
l wanna do a comedy.

06:40.447 --> 06:41.727
But you've done comedy before.

06:41.907 --> 06:45.158
Brenda, this will allow you
to stretch as an actress.

06:45.370 --> 06:48.621
Besides, Mr. Suiter suggested it.

06:48.958 --> 06:50.749
He did?

06:50.961 --> 06:53.499
Well, why don't we try it out
and we'll see how it goes?

06:56.969 --> 06:58.760
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:58.930 --> 07:00.673
You know, the scene
from The Turning Point

07:00.849 --> 07:02.224
was really a terrific idea.

07:02.393 --> 07:06.344
l was already thinking of taking a risk
on a dynamic character piece.

07:06.523 --> 07:07.602
Can you keep a secret?

07:07.983 --> 07:09.976
- ls it about me?
- Yes.

07:10.153 --> 07:11.433
Then most definitely.

07:12.782 --> 07:16.152
l intentionally paired you up
with Andrea because, well,

07:16.328 --> 07:18.119
l think you can help her
open up a bit.

07:19.165 --> 07:20.576
Well, l'm flattered.

07:20.792 --> 07:22.785
No, you're talented.

07:24.464 --> 07:26.421
Thanks.

07:40.527 --> 07:42.187
Outstanding.

07:42.362 --> 07:44.936
- You care for a nut?
- No, thanks.

07:45.116 --> 07:46.776
That's a real wise decision.

07:47.202 --> 07:49.409
Them things been in there
since 1 987.

07:52.418 --> 07:54.411
Well, sir.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.458
l think you're gonna like this baby.

07:58.551 --> 08:00.045
- l already do.
- Yes, sir.

08:00.220 --> 08:02.427
You know, when the first
of summer rolls around

08:02.639 --> 08:05.475
and all the kids come in
checking out a car of this calibre,

08:05.643 --> 08:08.313
l think,
''No, they ain't gonna come back.''

08:08.689 --> 08:11.359
There was something different
about you. l said to myself:

08:11.526 --> 08:15.061
''Simon, this young man
is gonna be back.''

08:15.281 --> 08:18.947
Well, l sure had to pick up a lot
of empty margarita glasses

08:19.120 --> 08:21.576
and haul around a lot of sweaty towels
for all those zeros.

08:23.751 --> 08:25.791
Tubular.

10:00.379 --> 10:03.713
- Get that yellow thing out there--
- Excuse me.

10:04.134 --> 10:07.586
Put something else out there
where that yellow one is, all right?

10:07.764 --> 10:08.962
Get it right this time.

10:09.141 --> 10:10.884
How you doing, son?
What can l do for you?

10:11.060 --> 10:13.302
You can give me my money back.

10:13.939 --> 10:16.311
Now, why in the world
would l want to do a thing like that?

10:16.526 --> 10:18.435
Because that car you sold me
is, at this moment,

10:18.612 --> 10:20.521
blocking traffic
on Sunset Boulevard.

10:20.740 --> 10:21.903
l couldn't even pull it over.

10:22.075 --> 10:24.745
See, this is a problem
of semantics here.

10:24.912 --> 10:26.655
The key is in the wording.

10:26.831 --> 10:29.667
''That car l sold you.''

10:29.877 --> 10:31.252
That's your problem now, son.

10:31.420 --> 10:33.294
- Give me my cheque.
- l ain't got it.

10:33.465 --> 10:35.505
- Get it.
- l can't do that.

10:35.676 --> 10:37.835
l mean, l'd like to.
You're a good kid. l like you.

10:38.013 --> 10:41.133
- l'd like to help you. My hands are tied.
- Well, untie them.

10:43.854 --> 10:47.389
Here's the deal, kid.
You bought that car.

10:47.609 --> 10:51.524
Now, if you say you are experiencing
some difficulties with it,

10:51.697 --> 10:55.232
then by all means,
get that sucker into a good mechanic

10:55.411 --> 10:57.202
just as soon as you can.

10:57.372 --> 11:01.323
But that car was in prime condition
when it left the lot.

11:01.502 --> 11:03.993
l know
because l checked it out myself.

11:12.225 --> 11:15.179
Okay, Brandon,
what's the bottom line here?

11:15.396 --> 11:17.970
The engine has to be
completely overhauled.

11:19.317 --> 11:22.402
You know, all l've heard about
for the past three months

11:22.572 --> 11:24.648
is how gorgeous this car looks.

11:24.825 --> 11:26.319
Everything completely restored,

11:26.494 --> 11:29.994
but next to nothing about how it runs.
At least now l understand why.

11:30.165 --> 11:32.835
l know, l can't believe it either.

11:33.002 --> 11:34.876
What about the warranty?

11:35.047 --> 11:36.245
No warranty.

11:38.092 --> 11:40.049
This is great.

11:40.471 --> 11:42.511
Did you even bother to look
under the hood at all?

11:42.724 --> 11:44.099
- Yeah, but--
- But what?

11:44.267 --> 11:46.010
l can't believe these guys
make their living

11:46.186 --> 11:47.811
by completely ripping people off.

11:51.026 --> 11:54.526
- l knew l should have gone with you.
- Yeah, well, you didn't.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.573
Where is the car now?

12:01.624 --> 12:02.703
Brandon.

12:04.502 --> 12:07.207
lt's in the impound lot
in the San Gabriel Valley.

12:08.341 --> 12:09.919
Oh, of course.

12:10.135 --> 12:12.294
That's a perfectly logical place
for it to wind up.

12:12.471 --> 12:13.799
- Jim.
- How, pray tell,

12:13.973 --> 12:15.515
did it manage to end up there?

12:15.684 --> 12:19.517
Well, when l went back
to the used-car lot to complain,

12:19.689 --> 12:21.432
a tow truck
from the sheriff's department

12:21.650 --> 12:24.936
just happened
to be cruising by and...

12:25.489 --> 12:29.238
How much is it going to cost
to get it released?

12:30.328 --> 12:32.285
- Two hundred and fifty dollars.
- Oh, no.

12:32.456 --> 12:34.164
How could you throw away
all of your money?

12:34.334 --> 12:36.077
This isn't your problem.
This is my problem.

12:36.253 --> 12:38.744
- l'll deal with it, all right?
- Yes, you will deal with it.

12:38.923 --> 12:41.082
But there's a lesson here, Brandon,
and it's in Latin:

12:41.260 --> 12:44.677
Caveat emptor,
let the buyer beware.

12:54.944 --> 12:57.067
Oh, excuse me.

13:06.877 --> 13:08.455
So, what can l get you today?

13:10.715 --> 13:14.167
How about two eggs over-easy,
rye toast.

13:14.345 --> 13:15.376
Anything to drink?

13:16.306 --> 13:18.014
- Just water.
- lce?

13:19.060 --> 13:20.803
- Sure.
- Crushed or cubes?

13:22.439 --> 13:24.348
Whatever.

13:26.737 --> 13:28.860
- Hey, Brandon.
- Nat.

13:29.031 --> 13:30.311
- lt's been a long time.
- Yeah.

13:30.492 --> 13:32.948
- How's it going?
- lt's going-- lt could be better.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.495
lt could always be better.

13:34.914 --> 13:37.584
Yeah, l guess it could.
Place looks great.

13:38.085 --> 13:40.457
Yeah, it will if they ever finish it.

13:41.673 --> 13:43.962
- So how's business?
- lt's booming.

13:44.177 --> 13:45.802
Good.

13:46.388 --> 13:47.799
So how's the new girl working out?

13:48.307 --> 13:51.890
Here you go.
Eggs over-easy with rye toast.

14:00.281 --> 14:03.448
- Need l say more?
- l think she's pretty much on top of it.

14:03.619 --> 14:06.573
Yeah, Courtney's a straight-A student
from Beverly Hills High.

14:06.790 --> 14:10.623
l really lucked out finding her.
On such short notice.

14:14.050 --> 14:16.624
- Take it easy.
- Yeah.

14:17.471 --> 14:19.049
Could you pass me
the sports page, man?

14:19.223 --> 14:21.893
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

14:22.060 --> 14:25.227
- Great place, huh?
- Yeah, l used to work here.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.058
Oh, yeah?

14:27.234 --> 14:30.070
l've been in town all summer
and l just discovered it last week.

14:30.279 --> 14:33.613
They got this Mexican burger here
with jalapenos and avocados.

14:33.784 --> 14:36.192
Man, you can't get anything
like that in Chicago.

14:36.788 --> 14:38.448
- You're from Chicago?
- Yeah.

14:38.624 --> 14:41.460
Why is it that nobody in L.A.
is actually from L.A.?

14:41.670 --> 14:44.340
l don't know. l could see myself
moving out here someday.

14:44.507 --> 14:47.045
Skiing is two hours away.
The desert's two hours away.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.757
The grocery store is two hours away
in rush-hour traffic.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.718
Yeah, the traffic is wretched.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.557
Well, l don't have to worry
about that anymore

14:54.729 --> 14:56.437
now that l don't have a car.

14:57.065 --> 14:59.354
- l'm gonna be late for class.
- You go to UCLA?

14:59.527 --> 15:02.861
No, l'm teaching drama over
at West Beverly High.

15:03.073 --> 15:04.104
You're kidding me.

15:04.283 --> 15:06.691
My sister's taking that this summer,
Brenda Walsh.

15:06.870 --> 15:09.029
- Brenda Walsh is your sister?
- Twin sister.

15:09.206 --> 15:10.404
- No way.
- Yeah.

15:10.625 --> 15:12.618
- What a small world.
- Small?

15:12.836 --> 15:14.081
Beverly Hills is miniature.

15:15.089 --> 15:17.165
- Brenda Walsh's twin, huh?
- Yeah.

15:17.342 --> 15:19.631
You know, she really has
an amazing dramatic presence.

15:19.804 --> 15:21.631
She just blows me away.

15:22.224 --> 15:24.466
- Chris Suiter.
- Brandon Walsh, obviously.

15:24.643 --> 15:26.185
Nice meeting you.
And say hi to Brenda.

15:26.354 --> 15:28.477
You too. All right, l will.

15:29.817 --> 15:33.732
- Anything else?
- No, thanks.

15:39.872 --> 15:43.573
You know, if l enter stage left,
then l could cross to you for the slap.

15:43.752 --> 15:46.326
Why? What's your
emotional motivation?

15:46.506 --> 15:48.832
- l don't know. Let me check my notes.
- No, Andrea,

15:49.009 --> 15:51.880
use emotion from your own life
and transfer it into your character.

15:52.055 --> 15:54.178
But l'm not a washed-up
ballet dancer.

15:54.850 --> 15:57.176
Okay, okay. Just say your line,
when l go to hit you,

15:57.354 --> 15:59.892
jerk your head to the side,
and it'll look like we connected.

16:00.065 --> 16:02.437
- But not hard, right?
- Andrea, if the timing's right,

16:02.611 --> 16:06.194
- we won't even make contact.
- Well, if it isn't the thespians.

16:06.866 --> 16:08.609
Trying to be.

16:10.329 --> 16:13.366
Oh, hey, l ran into your drama coach
at the Pit today.

16:14.460 --> 16:16.038
Chris hangs out at the Peach Pit?

16:16.963 --> 16:18.872
l thought his name was Mr. Suiter.

16:19.299 --> 16:21.873
- Whatever.
- Yeah, he eats there all the time.

16:22.095 --> 16:24.218
He had some nice things to say
about you.

16:24.431 --> 16:25.462
Like what?

16:26.935 --> 16:28.975
Like your head will get too big
if l clue you in.

16:29.146 --> 16:30.889
You better tell me later.

16:32.859 --> 16:34.602
l told you
you were teacher's pet.

16:34.778 --> 16:38.029
Well, it's a tough job
but somebody's gotta do it.

16:38.199 --> 16:40.073
l'll cross to you because l'm jealous.

16:40.244 --> 16:43.080
That's the answer. Jealous.

16:58.977 --> 17:00.008
Hi.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.939
- Andrea, what are you doing here?
- l don't know.

17:03.108 --> 17:06.525
Suddenly, l got this intense craving
for one of Nat's chilli cheeseburgers.

17:12.036 --> 17:16.450
Hey, Courtney,
let me have a tamale special.

17:16.626 --> 17:18.286
You got it.

17:23.885 --> 17:25.794
What is this,
the Walsh family hangout?

17:25.971 --> 17:27.880
l ran into your brother here
this morning.

17:28.098 --> 17:30.092
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:30.269 --> 17:34.731
You know, l was just about to order
if you'd like to join me. Us.

17:34.942 --> 17:37.480
Okay, l'd love to.

17:43.286 --> 17:44.484
So how's the scene coming?

17:44.663 --> 17:46.323
- Fine.
- Fine.

17:46.499 --> 17:49.833
Okay, okay, this doesn't have
to be a business lunch.

17:50.003 --> 17:51.497
Have you tried
the cappuccino shakes?

17:51.672 --> 17:54.163
- They are incredible.
- Well, you know, l used to work here.

17:54.342 --> 17:56.169
l even created
my own original milkshake:

17:56.345 --> 17:58.385
Laverne's Shake, Rattle and Roll.

17:58.598 --> 18:00.009
Well, l have to try it sometime.

18:00.183 --> 18:02.674
lf you want a phenomenal milkshake,
there's this place

18:02.854 --> 18:04.811
on Hollywood Boulevard
called C.C. Brown's.

18:04.981 --> 18:07.353
That's the oldest in Hollywood.
Been there since the '20s.

18:07.568 --> 18:10.439
l've been in L.A. all summer
and l've yet to really see the sights.

18:10.614 --> 18:14.031
lf you want a personal guided tour,
l'd be happy to take you this afternoon.

18:14.244 --> 18:15.275
Well, that'd be great.

18:15.454 --> 18:18.574
l'd love a tour
from two authentic California girls.

18:21.086 --> 18:22.794
Two?

18:28.846 --> 18:32.050
Do you know my brother has the exact
same shoe size as Paul Newman?

18:32.226 --> 18:34.468
Figures he would.

18:34.771 --> 18:36.645
Oh, they have
the best popcorn here.

18:36.815 --> 18:39.223
With real butter,
not that imitation stuff.

18:39.402 --> 18:41.810
The architects Meyer and Holler
designed the Chinese Theatre

18:41.989 --> 18:43.697
as a shrine to Hollywood in 1 927.

18:54.839 --> 18:56.250
Melrose is a happening street.

18:56.467 --> 18:58.626
lt's totally L.A., talk about trendy.

18:58.845 --> 19:01.681
Melrose only started taking off
when the real estate on Rodeo Drive

19:01.849 --> 19:04.387
- got too expensive.
- That's interesting.

19:08.065 --> 19:10.735
That's the building they show
on the opening credits of L.A. Law.

19:10.944 --> 19:13.518
Andrea, l'm sure Chris
has better things to do

19:13.698 --> 19:16.070
than sit in front of the TV
every Thursday night.

19:16.285 --> 19:18.361
Actually, L.A. Law
is my favourite show.

19:18.579 --> 19:19.742
- Mine too.
- Mine too.

19:36.144 --> 19:37.603
ls this the La Brea Tar Pits?

19:37.771 --> 19:39.847
Oh, yeah, and those are some tourists

19:40.024 --> 19:41.981
who got lost
during the Pleistocene era.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.527
l don't think l could have
had a better tour.

19:48.703 --> 19:51.574
Everything about it was just great,
especially the company.

19:51.748 --> 19:53.955
- Thank you, ladies.
- Oh, you're very welcome.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.285
Our pleasure.

19:56.713 --> 19:59.631
So which one of you
lives the closest?

19:59.842 --> 20:00.873
- She does.
- She does.

20:06.893 --> 20:09.384
Oh, Brandon, Brandon, Brandon.

20:09.605 --> 20:11.147
My mother's coming back
from Europe.

20:11.316 --> 20:14.401
Kelly's got her rash again,
and the luau's coming up.

20:14.570 --> 20:16.729
All signs indicate
that the summer's over

20:16.907 --> 20:19.529
- and l've barely touched a babe.
- That's rough, man.

20:19.744 --> 20:22.414
Maybe l'd do better next summer
if l got a job at the beach club.

20:22.581 --> 20:24.823
l don't think the world's
ready for that, Steve.

20:27.546 --> 20:29.835
l can't believe l blew all my money
on that damn car.

20:30.007 --> 20:31.205
l don't know why your father

20:31.384 --> 20:33.673
won't just pay to have it released
from the impound lot.

20:33.888 --> 20:36.011
Because he gets off
on seeing me squirm.

20:36.808 --> 20:38.848
lt's all right though,
l don't need his help.

20:39.019 --> 20:40.394
l just need a new job.

20:40.605 --> 20:42.099
How about going back
to the Peach Pit?

20:42.274 --> 20:43.899
Never happen. Not with Courtney

20:44.068 --> 20:46.986
the bionic waitress on the job.

20:49.742 --> 20:52.280
Welcome home, Bren.

20:55.333 --> 20:56.792
Yo, Bren, what's with you?

20:58.754 --> 21:01.755
l'm so mortified, l can't even call Kel.

21:02.342 --> 21:05.047
Oh, well, this is big time.

21:06.598 --> 21:10.050
lt doesn't even matter anymore.
l mean, the verdict is in.

21:10.228 --> 21:11.259
He dropped me off first.

21:11.438 --> 21:14.392
Not only first,
but before Andrea Zuckerman.

21:15.651 --> 21:17.026
What are you talking about?

21:17.237 --> 21:19.859
Chris. Can't you follow along?

21:20.408 --> 21:22.033
Well, what about Chris?

21:22.244 --> 21:25.198
l like him, but it doesn't matter
because--

21:25.373 --> 21:27.532
Whoa, Brenda.

21:27.709 --> 21:30.379
l hate to break this to you,
but he's your teacher.

21:31.047 --> 21:32.126
Not for long.

21:33.425 --> 21:35.085
Look, l don't even
wanna get into this.

21:35.303 --> 21:38.340
He's moving back to Chicago,
he's too old for you,

21:38.515 --> 21:42.050
and it's totally unethical
for you to date him.

21:43.188 --> 21:45.145
Tell that to Andrea.

21:49.530 --> 21:52.448
This place used to be nothing but
orange trees until after World War ll,

21:52.617 --> 21:54.526
when all the Gls
who served in the Pacific front

21:54.703 --> 21:56.245
started migrating west en masse.

21:56.414 --> 21:58.621
Back then, you could get a lot
for practically nothing,

21:58.792 --> 22:01.793
and the Gl Bill paid
for most of the construction costs.

22:04.258 --> 22:05.918
Oh, l'm sorry. l just--

22:06.093 --> 22:08.086
- l tend to go off on tangents--
- No, no, no.

22:08.263 --> 22:10.719
lt's great, it's great. You're great.

22:12.894 --> 22:16.513
l think that Brenda and l
have most of our scene down.

22:16.691 --> 22:19.692
You know, l'm still a little bit nervous,
but l think we can really get--

22:19.862 --> 22:21.237
Andrea,

22:21.406 --> 22:25.405
l don't wanna talk
about school right now, okay?

22:26.454 --> 22:28.079
Okay.

22:28.248 --> 22:30.157
l...

22:30.334 --> 22:32.576
Well...

22:32.963 --> 22:36.629
This is kind of a difficult situation
for me tonight.

22:37.343 --> 22:40.214
- What is?
- Well...

22:40.389 --> 22:42.298
Tomorrow's our last day
of class, right?

22:42.475 --> 22:44.764
- Yeah.
- And l was...

22:44.937 --> 22:49.683
...kind of hoping that l could talk you
into having a cup of coffee with me

22:49.860 --> 22:50.891
tomorrow night.

22:52.363 --> 22:54.403
Just you and me?

22:55.659 --> 22:57.568
Just you and me.

23:00.332 --> 23:02.408
l'd like that, sure.

23:02.627 --> 23:05.118
Yeah? Okay.

23:09.511 --> 23:12.049
- Good night.
- Bye.

23:53.278 --> 23:58.356
Brenda. Brenda, l am so terrified
about this scene.

23:58.535 --> 23:59.698
Don't worry about it.

24:00.913 --> 24:03.072
Brenda, l...

24:03.958 --> 24:08.288
lt's really weird, but Chris
is so not what l expected.

24:08.506 --> 24:10.499
What happened to Mr. Suiter?

24:10.717 --> 24:12.924
Oh, well, l...

24:13.596 --> 24:15.505
l had a really great time last night.

24:15.724 --> 24:18.013
Oh, is that before or after
you dumped me off?

24:18.227 --> 24:20.979
Hey, look, really, l didn't mean
to invade your territory.

24:21.190 --> 24:23.064
lt's just, he's so smart, you know,

24:23.234 --> 24:25.690
and genuinely interested
in the things that l have to say.

24:25.863 --> 24:27.191
Look, Andrea, that's great--

24:27.406 --> 24:31.025
Maybe it's because he's older,
but he gets me in a different way

24:31.203 --> 24:32.828
than any of the kids
at West Beverly do.

24:33.039 --> 24:36.491
- Andrea--
- But the thing is, until last night,

24:36.669 --> 24:39.421
l didn't even realise
l had these feelings for him at all.

24:39.589 --> 24:41.582
Andrea, that's good,
and l'm really happy for you.

24:41.759 --> 24:44.085
But we do have a scene to do,
and if you don't mind,

24:44.262 --> 24:46.753
l would like to run some lines
if that's okay with you?

24:47.850 --> 24:49.344
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:49.519 --> 24:52.057
l am sick to death of your jealousy
and resentment.

24:52.273 --> 24:53.304
l loved him.

24:53.483 --> 24:55.357
So much that you said
to hell with your career?

24:55.527 --> 24:56.902
Yes.

24:57.071 --> 24:59.609
You can lie to yourself,
DeeDee, but not me.

24:59.783 --> 25:02.488
You got married because you knew
you were second-rate.

25:02.703 --> 25:04.743
You got pregnant because Wayne
was a ballet dancer

25:04.914 --> 25:06.539
and that meant queer.

25:06.750 --> 25:09.455
- He wasn't.
- Still afraid someone will think he is?

25:09.671 --> 25:11.878
You were terrified then.
You had to prove he was a man.

25:12.049 --> 25:13.080
That's why you had Emilia.

25:13.259 --> 25:15.252
- That's a lie.
- No, that's the truth.

25:15.470 --> 25:18.175
You saddled Wayne with a baby
and you blew his career.

25:18.391 --> 25:20.550
But now Emilia's all grown up.

25:20.769 --> 25:23.439
And she's a better dancer
than you ever were, and you're jealous.

25:23.606 --> 25:27.225
You're certifiable.
You'll use anything as an excuse.

25:27.444 --> 25:30.695
- And what's that an excuse for?
- Trying to take away my child.

25:30.907 --> 25:34.027
l return the compliment.
You are a liar.

25:34.245 --> 25:35.573
You're a user.

25:35.789 --> 25:37.616
You have been your whole life.

25:37.833 --> 25:41.000
Me, Michael, pretending to love him.
And now Emilia.

25:41.213 --> 25:42.624
l'm better for her than you are.

25:42.840 --> 25:43.955
The hell you are.

26:04.786 --> 26:07.990
Brenda. Brenda?

26:08.165 --> 26:10.122
That is not
how we rehearsed the slap.

26:10.293 --> 26:12.784
- Oh, no?
- You know damn well it wasn't.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.998
l guess l just got too involved
in my character.

26:15.467 --> 26:17.424
That is so lame.

26:17.594 --> 26:20.132
There was something else
behind that slap and you know it.

26:21.141 --> 26:22.421
Sense-memory work?

26:23.644 --> 26:26.515
And what is that memory
based on?

26:26.690 --> 26:28.517
Oh, quick learner.

26:28.734 --> 26:30.857
l think you know, teacher's pet.

26:32.656 --> 26:34.696
This is perfect.

26:34.867 --> 26:37.074
l confide in you, share my feelings,

26:37.245 --> 26:40.496
something l never do,
and you completely turn on me.

26:40.708 --> 26:42.535
Yeah, well,
who confided in who first?

26:42.753 --> 26:44.995
l said l was sorry, Brenda.

26:45.173 --> 26:47.166
l had no idea
that he was interested in me

26:47.342 --> 26:50.379
as anything more than a pupil
with stage fright.

26:50.597 --> 26:52.886
Yeah, well, now
we know differently, don't we?

26:53.642 --> 26:56.216
Look, Brenda,
you can't steal something

26:56.396 --> 26:58.638
from someone that they don't have
in the first place.

27:01.736 --> 27:05.569
You know, all school year,
l listened to you rattling on and on

27:05.742 --> 27:07.735
about your feelings for my brother.

27:07.953 --> 27:09.613
This has nothing to do
with Brandon.

27:10.039 --> 27:11.581
You're right.

27:11.750 --> 27:13.790
lt has to do with you and me.

27:14.336 --> 27:16.662
Not anymore.

27:21.304 --> 27:24.508
Oh, hi, honey,
how'd your scene go today?

27:24.683 --> 27:25.881
l don't wanna talk about it.

27:26.060 --> 27:28.053
Oh, that good, huh?

27:28.230 --> 27:30.389
Actually, we got a standing ovation.

27:30.691 --> 27:32.850
That's terrific.

27:33.028 --> 27:35.650
And l was a supreme bitch.

27:35.823 --> 27:36.938
Brenda?

27:37.117 --> 27:40.035
Well, Mom, l was.
l was petty, l was mean.

27:40.204 --> 27:44.203
l've never been more glad to see
a summer come to an end.

27:45.127 --> 27:47.749
lf that's Kel,
l don't wanna see anyone.

27:47.923 --> 27:50.130
Not anyone?

27:52.804 --> 27:54.132
Aloha.

27:54.515 --> 27:56.638
l was hoping it would be you.

27:56.851 --> 27:58.808
- Did you miss me?
- Yes.

27:58.979 --> 28:01.387
l missed you.

28:02.359 --> 28:06.025
- Hey.
- Oh, Dylan.

28:10.077 --> 28:11.405
Mahalo means thank you.

28:11.579 --> 28:14.497
Oh, Dylan,
you didn't have to do anything.

28:14.708 --> 28:15.739
Well, when l was in Maui,

28:15.918 --> 28:18.623
l got to thinking about how great
you guys were for me this summer.

28:18.797 --> 28:21.668
And l wanted to do something
to say thank you.

28:21.843 --> 28:24.797
Well, mahalo to you, Dylan.

28:25.014 --> 28:26.639
These flowers just smell incredible.

28:26.808 --> 28:28.006
Mahalo, sir.

28:28.477 --> 28:30.849
lt's good to have you back, Dylan.

28:34.276 --> 28:35.984
Oh, two points.

28:36.195 --> 28:37.689
- Easy shot.
- Yeah, right.

28:37.906 --> 28:40.362
You've probably been practising
all summer. How's it going?

28:40.576 --> 28:42.118
What's happening
with the '65 'Stang?

28:42.871 --> 28:44.199
You don't wanna know.

28:44.414 --> 28:46.323
Don't tell me somebody bought it.

28:46.501 --> 28:48.328
- No such luck.
- Jim.

28:48.503 --> 28:50.792
Who else would spend thousands
of dollars on a used car

28:50.965 --> 28:52.673
and never even bother
to test-drive it?

28:53.510 --> 28:54.541
Thanks, Dad.

28:54.762 --> 28:56.589
Maybe we can have it towed
into the backyard,

28:56.764 --> 28:57.879
use it as a planter.

29:00.060 --> 29:02.551
Don't you think Brandon
feels bad enough about that car fiasco

29:02.730 --> 29:04.224
without you constantly rubbing it in?

29:04.399 --> 29:06.475
He was absolutely
ass-backward irresponsible

29:06.652 --> 29:07.850
with the purchase of that car.

29:08.029 --> 29:10.188
And you won't let him forget it.

29:10.366 --> 29:12.940
l think you better ask yourself
why you're being so hard on him.

29:13.119 --> 29:14.494
Because he wouldn't listen to me.

29:14.663 --> 29:18.080
l don't believe that,
and neither do you.

29:26.721 --> 29:28.464
- Wait a minute, l got a better one.
- Okay.

29:28.640 --> 29:30.134
lt's The Taming of the Shrew, right?

29:30.309 --> 29:31.851
And l'm running around
on-stage in this

29:32.019 --> 29:34.012
one-piece 1 7th-century tights thing.

29:34.189 --> 29:36.348
Oh, l would've loved to have seen it.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.019
Anyway, everyone's
backstage giggling

29:38.194 --> 29:39.688
because they thought it'd be great

29:39.863 --> 29:41.571
- if they poured honey down the back.
- No.

29:41.741 --> 29:45.027
Yes. So l'm out there
reciting Shakespeare

29:45.204 --> 29:46.484
with honey stuck to my butt.

29:50.794 --> 29:53.166
You know,
you're really easy to talk to.

29:56.051 --> 29:58.625
Well, l love your stories.

29:58.847 --> 30:00.721
What l love is the way
you listen to them.

30:03.853 --> 30:05.431
You're really beautiful, Andrea.

30:09.152 --> 30:10.611
l...

30:11.697 --> 30:13.440
What?

30:13.908 --> 30:16.696
- Nothing.
- No, no, no. Go on, say it.

30:16.871 --> 30:20.075
Tell me. Come on.

30:22.753 --> 30:24.829
When you smile, you get this

30:25.006 --> 30:28.423
funny little crinkle thing
around your eyes, and...

30:30.389 --> 30:31.931
l can't believe l just said that.

30:32.350 --> 30:34.676
lt's because l'm very old.

30:36.063 --> 30:37.854
And very wise.

30:38.816 --> 30:41.687
And about to do
something very stupid.

30:52.251 --> 30:54.659
No, we can't. l--

30:54.838 --> 30:56.213
We shouldn't do this.

30:56.381 --> 30:57.959
- l'm sorry, l--
- Of course,

30:58.134 --> 31:00.590
the first totally engaging girl l meet

31:00.762 --> 31:04.013
in Los Angeles turns out
to be my student.

31:04.183 --> 31:06.259
Ex-student.

31:07.521 --> 31:11.650
lf you were just five years older,
or if l was five years younger...

31:11.819 --> 31:14.737
Oh, Chris,
l wish you weren't leaving.

31:14.948 --> 31:18.567
Well, you still have me
for two more days

31:18.744 --> 31:20.867
and two more nights.

31:23.334 --> 31:25.541
Can l see you again?

31:50.453 --> 31:51.733
Give me a second.

31:51.955 --> 31:53.070
Hey, Nat.

31:53.249 --> 31:54.529
Hey, Brandon.

31:54.709 --> 31:57.035
l've seen you more this week
than l have all summer.

31:57.212 --> 32:00.048
- So, what can l get you? Your usual?
- You remember my usual?

32:00.216 --> 32:01.461
- l'm flattered.
- Don't be.

32:01.635 --> 32:02.880
Who could forget charred burger

32:03.053 --> 32:06.257
with bacon, fried eggs,
onions and relish?

32:06.475 --> 32:08.764
- Hold the mayo.
- Don't insult me.

32:12.608 --> 32:15.146
Hey, isn't today the big day
for the luau

32:15.320 --> 32:17.277
at the Beverly Hills Beach Club?

32:17.448 --> 32:20.449
Shouldn't you be slicing pineapples
or something?

32:20.618 --> 32:22.694
Yeah, it's my last day there.

32:22.871 --> 32:24.662
l just came by to see
what was going on,

32:24.832 --> 32:26.540
you know, see how you're doing.

32:26.710 --> 32:28.917
Nothing much changes
around here.

32:29.714 --> 32:32.550
That new girl, she got the job
pretty wired, huh?

32:32.760 --> 32:36.177
Courtney? Yeah,
l couldn't ask for any more.

32:36.932 --> 32:38.177
ls she better than l was?

32:39.393 --> 32:41.184
Not better, different.

32:45.068 --> 32:48.568
Listen, Nat, this is gonna
sound kind of lame,

32:48.781 --> 32:53.111
but you think there's any way
l could get my old job back?

32:55.123 --> 32:56.498
Gee, l don't know, Brandon.

32:56.666 --> 32:59.703
Courtney's really terrific
when it comes to punctuality...

32:59.879 --> 33:02.453
- Hey, l was always on time.
-...and job commitment.

33:02.883 --> 33:04.626
She wouldn't race out of here
without notice

33:04.802 --> 33:06.842
if another career opportunity
headed her way.

33:07.055 --> 33:09.178
Nat, l'm sorry,
but l explained that to you already.

33:09.350 --> 33:11.972
l had to go earn big tips this summer.
l had to buy a car.

33:12.145 --> 33:13.520
So where's the car?

33:14.690 --> 33:15.721
lt's a long story.

33:18.237 --> 33:21.322
Well, since Courtney's going away
to college next week,

33:21.491 --> 33:24.065
l guess l'm gonna need
to hire someone.

33:25.371 --> 33:26.949
How long have you known
about this?

33:27.332 --> 33:30.452
A while. But l guess
l can give you a trial run.

33:30.628 --> 33:32.621
And you left me hanging
all that time?

33:33.173 --> 33:35.047
Yeah.

33:35.760 --> 33:38.334
Welcome home, Brandon.

34:09.847 --> 34:12.089
Well, that's got it.

34:15.563 --> 34:17.472
You know, this summer
would've been so righteous

34:17.649 --> 34:20.520
if l hadn't blown everything
on that lemon.

34:21.070 --> 34:24.071
Well, at least l got
to work with you, Henry.

34:24.366 --> 34:26.406
Work for me.

34:29.164 --> 34:30.327
l'm gonna miss you, man.

34:30.541 --> 34:32.415
Look, don't get maudlin on me now.

34:32.585 --> 34:34.578
We don't want your mascara
to start running.

34:35.422 --> 34:36.502
You're a funny guy.

34:36.674 --> 34:39.165
Brandon, there's somebody here
to see you in the parking lot.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.253
Thanks, Kel.

34:42.474 --> 34:44.016
Thanks for this summer, Henry.

34:44.184 --> 34:46.011
You're not gonna
get rid of me that easy now.

34:46.187 --> 34:48.096
- You can call.
- l know when to reach you too.

34:48.273 --> 34:50.599
Between 1 1 and 1 2, when
The Young and the Restless is on.

34:50.775 --> 34:52.484
Don't even try it.

34:52.695 --> 34:54.853
See you, buddy.

35:19.690 --> 35:22.098
What's my car doing here?

35:24.488 --> 35:29.400
You mean your newly rebuilt
classic 289 V-8?

35:30.829 --> 35:33.403
l can't believe this. You--

35:33.583 --> 35:35.243
You worked hard all summer.

35:35.419 --> 35:39.120
Your mother and l thought
you deserved something to show for it.

35:47.894 --> 35:48.925
l'm sorry, Dad.

35:50.063 --> 35:53.397
- For what?
- For screwing up at the used-car lot.

35:54.402 --> 35:55.565
l mean, l wanted this to be

35:55.738 --> 35:59.606
my major move
towards independence.

35:59.785 --> 36:02.621
And l guess l was too proud to admit
l could've used your help on it.

36:02.789 --> 36:04.034
lf you would've asked for help,

36:04.207 --> 36:05.867
l probably would've
chewed your head off.

36:06.585 --> 36:08.578
The truth is,

36:08.797 --> 36:13.211
after you totalled Mondale, part of me
was afraid to let you drive again.

36:14.262 --> 36:16.219
But l told you, Dad,
l don't drink anymore.

36:16.432 --> 36:17.630
l know.

36:17.809 --> 36:20.383
But it took me a long time
to be sure.

36:21.063 --> 36:22.641
And now you're sure?

36:23.775 --> 36:25.566
Enjoy the car, Brandon.

36:25.736 --> 36:27.729
You've earned it.

36:28.281 --> 36:31.532
Too bad you'll be driving around
in such a bogus set of wheels, buddy.

36:31.702 --> 36:34.193
Yeah, a car like this and you might
just have to take me out.

36:34.372 --> 36:35.403
Hey, don't get crazy.

36:35.582 --> 36:38.334
Hey, why don't we take a drive up
the coast before luau starts, huh?

36:38.503 --> 36:40.875
l'm so there.

36:42.884 --> 36:45.091
Oh, why don't you go ahead
and sit in the front, Steve?

36:45.262 --> 36:48.347
- Sit in the back.
- Thanks, Dad.

36:48.516 --> 36:50.058
Yeah.

36:50.227 --> 36:52.469
- Baby.
- Bye.

36:54.149 --> 36:55.394
Don't stay out too late.

36:55.567 --> 36:58.771
Let's ride. Yeah, mule.

37:11.380 --> 37:12.578
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:12.757 --> 37:14.797
- l thought you'd forgotten me.
- Never.

37:14.968 --> 37:17.459
Well, come on in.

37:18.097 --> 37:21.514
My mom went to the movies
with my sister and a friend.

37:21.685 --> 37:24.639
And... Oh, why don't you sit down?

37:24.814 --> 37:29.192
And my father's playing poker, so...

37:29.654 --> 37:31.943
...it looks like we're all alone.

37:32.116 --> 37:33.741
lf that's all right with you.

37:34.327 --> 37:37.744
Guess what.
l'm staying in Los Angeles.

37:38.833 --> 37:40.327
You are? That's great.

37:40.502 --> 37:43.254
Yeah, l got a job teaching
at the Winston School for Girls.

37:43.464 --> 37:46.216
That's supposed to be the best
private school in all of Los Angeles.

37:46.385 --> 37:48.294
That's what l hear.

37:48.721 --> 37:51.295
So when are you going
to Chicago to get your stuff?

37:54.020 --> 37:55.847
My girlfriend's bringing it out with her.

38:01.488 --> 38:04.655
- Your what?
- Look, l wanted to mention it, but--

38:06.495 --> 38:08.452
Andrea.

38:09.248 --> 38:11.455
Trust, truth and risk.

38:11.626 --> 38:13.702
That is all you talked about
this summer.

38:14.797 --> 38:16.624
Yeah, and you can't tell me

38:16.800 --> 38:20.217
you haven't implemented
those things into your life, right?

38:20.388 --> 38:23.508
You have a clever way of just
twisting things around, don't you?

38:23.684 --> 38:25.143
Andrea,

38:25.311 --> 38:28.681
it's my job to make you feel safe
so that you can learn and grow.

38:29.317 --> 38:31.524
l wanted to gain your trust

38:31.695 --> 38:34.780
by painting a picture
of who you wanted me to be.

38:34.991 --> 38:38.158
lf it meant leaving out pieces
of my personal life,

38:38.370 --> 38:41.870
well, l'm sorry.
But you can't say l didn't do my job.

38:43.460 --> 38:45.287
Funny me.

38:45.588 --> 38:47.379
l thought what we had
was personal.

38:47.591 --> 38:49.382
Look, Andrea,
if you were five years older--

38:49.552 --> 38:50.880
lf l were just five years older,

38:51.054 --> 38:52.963
you would still be cheating
on your girlfriend.

38:53.182 --> 38:54.842
Andrea, you're an incredible girl.

38:55.059 --> 38:57.515
l wish you could know that
as well as l do.

38:57.729 --> 39:00.565
But you're in high school,
and l'm a teacher.

39:00.733 --> 39:03.734
And we just can't do this.

39:03.946 --> 39:05.689
That's not what you said
last night, was it?

39:05.865 --> 39:09.614
Look, l'm really sorry.
l made a mistake, okay?

39:09.787 --> 39:12.824
l let my guard down,
and it wasn't professional.

39:14.001 --> 39:17.086
Yeah, and it wasn't fair either.

39:19.717 --> 39:23.716
Besides my friend Brandon,
you are the only guy l've ever let my--

39:24.181 --> 39:25.212
Andrea...

39:25.683 --> 39:28.055
l think you'd better go...

39:29.438 --> 39:30.897
...Mr. Suiter.

39:45.752 --> 39:49.537
Oh, we're going to a hukilau

39:49.715 --> 39:53.416
A huki, huki, huki, huki, hukilau

39:53.595 --> 39:57.344
Everybody loves a hukilau

39:57.517 --> 40:01.218
Where the laulau is the kau kau
At the big luau

40:01.397 --> 40:04.814
We throw our net out into the sea...

40:06.988 --> 40:08.019
Come on, what is this?

40:08.198 --> 40:10.606
The gathering place
of the truly unsociable, huh?

40:10.827 --> 40:13.034
- Pull up a chair.
- Hey, come on, you guys.

40:13.205 --> 40:15.827
lf l can make a fool of myself
out there, so can you. Come on.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.708
That's because they pay you
to be a squeef.

40:18.462 --> 40:20.669
Not anymore, buddy.

40:21.758 --> 40:23.252
Yeah, congratulations
on your new car.

40:23.427 --> 40:26.132
Thanks, Donna. Hey,
you wanna do a little hukilau?

40:26.305 --> 40:28.298
- Oh, l don't know.
- Come on.

40:29.894 --> 40:32.564
- You guys are weak.
- Come on, Brandon.

40:32.772 --> 40:34.812
Let's go do the hukilau.

40:36.861 --> 40:38.355
Robbing the cradle there, Bran.

40:38.572 --> 40:40.280
Well, at least Lindsey
will dance with me.

40:40.449 --> 40:42.027
Come on.

40:42.202 --> 40:43.577
--loves the hukilau

40:43.745 --> 40:47.874
Where the laulau is the kau kau
At the big luau

40:48.043 --> 40:52.042
We throw the net out into the sea

40:52.257 --> 40:55.128
And all the ama ama
Come swimming to me...

40:55.344 --> 40:58.844
So how does this compare
to a true authentic Hawaiian luau?

40:59.683 --> 41:01.972
Like l went to any
when l was over there.

41:02.729 --> 41:04.437
What did you do most nights?

41:04.648 --> 41:09.892
Hung out in my mom's
freaky tree house and dreamed of you.

41:10.322 --> 41:13.193
- Right.
- lt's true.

41:15.955 --> 41:18.327
Dylan, this thing that we have
is so confusing.

41:18.541 --> 41:20.119
lt doesn't have to be.

41:20.669 --> 41:22.792
l mean, when we're together,
it's great, but--

41:22.964 --> 41:24.043
What?

41:24.257 --> 41:26.380
Do you wanna be a free agent?

41:28.430 --> 41:33.058
While you were gone,
l went after another guy, an older guy.

41:33.395 --> 41:34.770
And?

41:37.066 --> 41:39.059
And l'm glad you're back.

41:46.579 --> 41:49.497
- lsn't that Andrea Zuckerman?
- Where?

41:53.797 --> 41:55.837
Andrea.

41:56.008 --> 41:58.678
Hi. l tried to call you at the house,

41:58.845 --> 42:01.171
but your mom said
that you and Brandon

42:01.348 --> 42:03.175
had come here to the beach.

42:04.102 --> 42:05.265
You've been crying.

42:05.479 --> 42:07.187
l've been having a bad night.

42:07.607 --> 42:08.852
Why?

42:13.573 --> 42:17.192
- Look, about the slap, l--
- Me too, huh?

42:18.830 --> 42:22.164
You're not the one
who should be apologising. lt's me.

42:22.335 --> 42:25.040
l'm the one who was
completely envious of your...

42:27.133 --> 42:28.627
Whatever it is with Chris.

42:28.843 --> 42:31.002
Was with Chris.

42:31.221 --> 42:32.501
Did you go out with him?

42:36.478 --> 42:39.479
- Did you...?
- No.

42:43.821 --> 42:47.155
Chris Suiter isn't who you think
he is, Brenda.

42:47.952 --> 42:49.945
Well, at least he's going back
to Chicago.

42:50.998 --> 42:53.786
No, he isn't. He's...

42:54.294 --> 42:57.580
He's staying in Los Angeles,

42:57.757 --> 42:59.714
and he's bringing his girlfriend out.

43:00.635 --> 43:03.755
- That two-faced--
- Brenda, look.

43:05.183 --> 43:08.600
Let's just make a pact
that we will never let a man

43:08.771 --> 43:10.016
get between us again, okay?

43:10.232 --> 43:12.059
Especially a teacher.

43:17.074 --> 43:20.111
Hey, what are you crying for?

43:20.328 --> 43:23.033
Oh, l just really need to be
with people tonight.

43:23.499 --> 43:25.539
Well, then you came
to the right place, no?

43:25.752 --> 43:26.783
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

43:26.962 --> 43:30.332
Party, this way.
Plenty of men to go around.

43:30.509 --> 43:34.508
Oh, we're going to a hukilau

43:34.681 --> 43:38.051
A huki, huki, huki, huki, hukilau

43:38.227 --> 43:41.976
Everybody loves a hukilau

43:42.149 --> 43:46.064
Where the laulau is the kau kau
At the big luau

43:46.238 --> 43:50.023
We throw our net out into the sea

43:50.201 --> 43:53.736
And all the ama ama
Come swimming to me

43:53.915 --> 43:57.830
Oh, we're going to the hukilau

43:58.003 --> 44:01.373
A huki, huki, huki, hukilau

44:01.842 --> 44:05.627
What a wonderful day for fishing

44:05.805 --> 44:09.424
The old Hawaiian way

44:09.602 --> 44:13.054
The hukilau nets are swishing

44:13.232 --> 44:16.981
Down in old Laie Bay

44:17.154 --> 44:20.855
Oh, we're going to the hukilau...
