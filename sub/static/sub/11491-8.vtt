00:00.860 --> 00:03.760
Ask your doctor if it's right for you.

00:03.770 --> 00:07.550
So, do either of you guys
urinate with abnormal frequency?

00:10.180 --> 00:12.120
no.

00:13.820 --> 00:17.120
I mean, you gotta define abnormal.

00:17.130 --> 00:20.830
And keep in mind the body doesn't
process alcohol efficiently.

00:21.670 --> 00:25.290
Which is why your uncle Charlie
is a perpetual urine machine.

00:25.300 --> 00:30.490
Also keep in mind that your father has the
bladder control of a frightened nine-year-old girl.

00:31.990 --> 00:35.820
Which is why he needs to wear two
pairs of undies and a panty liner.

00:36.740 --> 00:38.960
Only on long drives.

00:38.970 --> 00:41.460
Oh, really? How many times a
night do you get up to pee?

00:41.470 --> 00:43.940
- Just once.
- I can hear your toilet flush, Alan.

00:43.950 --> 00:45.730
Okay, four times.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.800
But at least I get out of bed to pee.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.650
That was an isolated incident.

00:51.670 --> 00:54.150
I was dreaming my shoes were on fire.

00:54.590 --> 00:57.220
- Does that answer your question, buddy?
- Yeah.

00:57.670 --> 01:00.200
And remind me to never ask another one.

01:01.220 --> 01:03.580
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

01:03.590 --> 01:06.430
- Why aren't you ready?
- Ready for...?

01:06.440 --> 01:08.330
You've got to be kidding me.

01:08.350 --> 01:12.040
I've told you at least three times we're
having dinner with my girlfriend Gail tonight.

01:12.050 --> 01:14.510
Excuse me, gotta pee.

01:14.950 --> 01:17.120
I swear to god, you never
listen when I'm talking to you.

01:17.140 --> 01:19.080
It's like you just tune me out.

01:19.110 --> 01:22.460
You look like you're paying attention,
but your mind is a million miles away.

01:22.470 --> 01:25.020
Do I need to pee?

01:26.180 --> 01:29.510
nah. I mean, I could. Might be traffic.

01:29.520 --> 01:32.160
Probably should pee. Yeah, better pee.

01:32.170 --> 01:35.560
Now we're going to be late, and I'm going to
be embarrassed all because you don't listen.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.250
boy, she's got great boobies.

02:07.890 --> 02:10.759
So, Charlie, I've heard so
many nice things about you.

02:10.770 --> 02:14.160
Really? From who?

02:14.560 --> 02:16.570
Hello.

02:17.270 --> 02:19.720
Oh, right. Thanks.

02:19.990 --> 02:22.210
I guess I only hear the complaints.

02:23.390 --> 02:25.180
You don't hear anything.

02:25.190 --> 02:27.820
- That's not true.
- You're right. It's not.

02:27.830 --> 02:30.110
He hears what he wants to hear.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.110
So I'm right.

02:33.930 --> 02:36.480
- Well, you still make a great couple.
- Thank you.

02:36.780 --> 02:39.110
And I'm really looking
forward to your wedding.

02:39.530 --> 02:42.100
I'm sure it's going to be beautiful.

02:43.950 --> 02:45.650
What'd I do?

02:45.660 --> 02:48.300
Nothing. I told you she's
going through a bad breakup.

02:48.310 --> 02:50.040
When did you tell me that?

02:50.050 --> 02:53.280
In the car, on the way here. god.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.490
It's going to be okay.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.590
I know. It's just hard.

02:58.690 --> 03:00.200
I thought I knew him.

03:00.220 --> 03:03.740
I thought we were going to be
together forever, like you and Charlie.

03:04.330 --> 03:07.880
Hard to believe somebody
got tired of doing her.

03:09.070 --> 03:11.760
Ooh, French fries look good.

03:12.820 --> 03:15.500
Why did I order the baked potato?

03:15.800 --> 03:18.570
- Isn't that right, Charlie?
- Absolutely.

03:19.370 --> 03:22.460
Now, is this the one who's
the old college room-mate?

03:22.470 --> 03:24.580
I should really listen more.

03:24.590 --> 03:26.900
I mean, I knew he was insensitive...

03:26.910 --> 03:30.510
Boy, I bet, if they were room-mates,
they did some experimenting.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.860
Why is it that girls can experiment
with other girls and not be gay,

03:34.880 --> 03:37.990
but if a guy so as much kisses
another guy-- Woop, bad memory.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.530
Drink... Drink, drink, drink.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.160
So you're just all alone
in that big apartment?

03:44.170 --> 03:46.100
He even took the dog.

03:46.300 --> 03:49.280
- Bastard.
- What? It's my first drink.

03:49.290 --> 03:52.370
Not you. Brian took Rufus.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.100
Who's Rufus?

03:55.630 --> 03:57.730
For that matter, who's Brian?

03:57.750 --> 04:00.530
Life of Brian-- That
was pretty funny.

04:00.540 --> 04:03.480
Brian's song, not so much.

04:03.490 --> 04:05.770
James Caan was great in it, though.

04:05.790 --> 04:07.530
That's 'cause he's a great actor.

04:07.550 --> 04:09.830
The godfather, roller ball...

04:09.840 --> 04:13.570
Yeah, I can so see these
two kissing in a dorm room.

04:14.740 --> 04:17.040
That's really sweet,
but I couldn't impose.

04:17.050 --> 04:18.380
We insist. Right, Charlie?

04:18.390 --> 04:20.320
Absolutely.

04:20.329 --> 04:23.240
There. You'll come stay with
us for a few days and heal.

04:23.250 --> 04:26.050
- I don't know what to say.
- Say yes.

04:27.040 --> 04:29.150
- Yes.
- Good.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.740
After dinner, we can go back to her
apartment so she can pack a bag.

04:31.750 --> 04:33.010
Absolutely.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.850
You'll love Charlie's place.
It's right on the sand.

04:35.860 --> 04:38.080
Very quiet, restful.

04:38.090 --> 04:40.420
Dear penthouse forum...

04:41.060 --> 04:43.300
I always thought your
letters were made up,

04:43.310 --> 04:46.830
until my fiancé college room-mate
came to stay with us for a few days.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.540
- Right, Charlie?
- Absolutely.

04:54.450 --> 04:57.000
Hey, Alan?

04:59.880 --> 05:01.590
Alan?

05:01.610 --> 05:03.760
Be right there.

05:06.090 --> 05:08.110
What's up?

05:13.110 --> 05:14.700
What were you doing?

05:14.720 --> 05:16.430
Um, shaving.

05:17.020 --> 05:21.500
- At night?
- Well, not so much shaving as... Trimming.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.340
So, uh,how was dinner?

05:25.440 --> 05:28.950
Forget dinner. Please tell
me you weren't using my razor.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.640
Mine doesn't have the floating heads.

05:32.700 --> 05:36.210
I don't believe you. I
put that thing on my face.

05:36.490 --> 05:38.500
I was going to clean it
before I gave it back.

05:38.540 --> 05:41.070
I
- I don't want it back!

05:41.390 --> 05:43.800
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's yours.

05:43.810 --> 05:46.380
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

05:46.390 --> 05:47.990
But this is just a
stocking stuffer, right?

05:48.010 --> 05:50.060
I mean, you are going to
get me a real present, too.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.240
A real present?

05:52.270 --> 05:55.650
Well, you obviously didn't put
much thought into this one.

05:57.170 --> 05:59.420
- Good night, Alan.
- Good night.

06:03.270 --> 06:06.420
Oh, I almost forgot. Pack
up your stuff and get out.

06:07.150 --> 06:09.810
Okay, okay, the razor can
be my Christmas present.

06:10.550 --> 06:13.320
No, no,no, Chelsea's girlfriend
is staying here for a few days,

06:13.350 --> 06:14.860
so you're going to sleep on the couch.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.280
Why don't you put her in Jakes room
and have Jake sleep on the couch?

06:17.290 --> 06:21.050
Fair question. Why don't you trim
your ball hair with a steak knife?

06:27.280 --> 06:29.890
I feel bad kicking your
brother out of his room.

06:29.910 --> 06:32.780
Well, that's only because
you don't know him.

06:33.450 --> 06:37.180
A little chamomile tea, help you sleep.

06:37.190 --> 06:39.680
Chelsea, I can't thank you enough.

06:39.720 --> 06:43.290
Don't be silly. I know what it
feels like to have my heart broken.

06:43.300 --> 06:45.680
Me, too.

06:46.680 --> 06:49.440
You know, theoretically.

06:49.760 --> 06:53.350
- Well,I'm grateful to you both.
- And we're grateful to you.

06:55.050 --> 06:57.630
You know, theoretically.

06:59.240 --> 07:02.180
Anyway, tomorrow, you can sleep in,
take a nice, long walk on the beach...

07:02.210 --> 07:04.950
I've been a really
good boyfriend tonight.

07:05.410 --> 07:08.360
Chelsea should do something nice for me.

07:09.320 --> 07:12.040
Like make out with Gail.

07:12.410 --> 07:15.280
Okay, I put fresh sheets on the bed.

07:15.550 --> 07:17.930
Alan, this is my friend
Gail. Gail, this is Alan.

07:17.940 --> 07:21.340
I'm so sorry to put you out like
this, but your brother said...

07:21.350 --> 07:24.950
Gorp. fnark. Schmegle.

07:26.650 --> 07:29.790
Oh, god,I've been waiting
for you all my life.

07:31.190 --> 07:34.060
Marry me. Have my children.

07:34.360 --> 07:36.340
it's really very generous of you.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.720
Gorp. Fnark. Schmegle.

07:41.710 --> 07:44.090
Come on, I'll show you the room.

07:46.000 --> 07:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:12.630 --> 08:15.100
Chelsea?

08:26.800 --> 08:29.190
Chelsea?

08:44.790 --> 08:46.520
Chels, you in there?

08:46.540 --> 08:49.390
It's okay, Charlie. Come on in.

08:56.850 --> 08:59.470
- Everything all right?
- She's pretty upset.

08:59.480 --> 09:02.770
I'm sorry I'm such a basket case.

09:02.780 --> 09:05.340
Oh, please. We're here for you, baby.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.640
- Right, Charlie?
- Absolutely.

09:11.940 --> 09:14.860
I guess I'll... Leave you two alone.

09:15.390 --> 09:17.910
You don't have to go.

09:20.970 --> 09:22.970
I don't?

09:22.980 --> 09:25.600
Not unless you want to.

09:26.380 --> 09:29.950
Gorp. Fnark. Schmegle.

09:30.330 --> 09:33.510
Come on, Charlie. We all know
what you really want to do.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.550
We do?

09:36.300 --> 09:38.660
We do.

09:39.150 --> 09:42.190
Come here. Join us.

09:45.230 --> 09:47.870
Uh, okay.

09:55.500 --> 09:58.870
So... What now?

09:59.430 --> 10:01.680
Do I really need to tell you?

10:01.690 --> 10:04.730
We'd probably be better off if you did.

10:06.330 --> 10:11.090
Okay. I want you to make Gail happy.

10:15.220 --> 10:17.390
And you're on board?

10:17.400 --> 10:19.570
It was my idea.

10:19.580 --> 10:21.880
Don't worry-- she and
I have done this before.

10:21.890 --> 10:25.900
- In college.
- I knew it.

10:29.880 --> 10:34.020
Okay, let's turn that frown upside down.

10:35.820 --> 10:38.520
That's a good boy.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.040
- Hey, Chels?
- Yeah, babe?

10:41.050 --> 10:44.540
- This is a dream, right?
- Of course it's a dream.

10:44.550 --> 10:47.360
You think I'm really gonna let
you sleep with my best friend?

10:48.810 --> 10:50.840
Well, in that case, hang on.

10:50.860 --> 10:53.750
'cause I'm gonna do some
real freaky stuff here.

11:10.340 --> 11:12.700
Yowza.

11:12.710 --> 11:16.350
Excuse me. I brought you
some fresh towels, Gail.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.420
Oh, aren't you sweet.

11:18.430 --> 11:22.520
Sure, sweet. Go smell his room.

11:25.170 --> 11:27.410
- Morning.
- Good, you're up.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.080
I made you some toast.
Here's your orange juice.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.610
- Oh, thank you, honey.
- I'll see you later.

11:33.140 --> 11:35.410
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, you're leaving?

11:35.420 --> 11:37.160
I told you I have to
go in to work today.

11:37.170 --> 11:39.150
But what about Gail?

11:39.160 --> 11:40.780
She can take care of herself.

11:40.790 --> 11:42.890
I think she's already made a new friend.

11:42.900 --> 11:46.590
Yeah, I saw. You don't think
he's got a shot, do you?

11:46.600 --> 11:49.460
- Charlie, you're horrible.
- I was joking.

11:49.470 --> 11:51.290
So how long are you going to be gone?

11:51.320 --> 11:54.600
I'll be home for dinner-- I thought maybe I'd pick
up some Chinese food, and we could stay in and...

11:54.610 --> 11:58.560
Is she nuts? I can't be
trusted alone with that chick.

11:59.360 --> 12:02.430
Wait, maybe this is a test. A trap.

12:02.440 --> 12:05.800
The two of them are in cahoots
to find out if I'll make a move.

12:06.120 --> 12:09.500
Cahoots, that's a funny word.

12:09.810 --> 12:11.820
Sounds like an owl sneezing.

12:19.460 --> 12:20.860
Morning, Alan.

12:20.890 --> 12:22.520
Oh, uh,morning.

12:22.540 --> 12:24.410
Thank you again for
letting Gail have your room.

12:24.440 --> 12:28.050
Oh, don't be silly. Happy to
do it. Uh, mi casa, her casa.

12:28.060 --> 12:31.850
It's actually his casa, but the dehumidifier
and the night-light belong to me.

12:32.450 --> 12:35.120
Still very nice of you. See ya later.

12:36.830 --> 12:38.680
What you got going on today?

12:38.700 --> 12:41.690
Going to play a little tennis in 1958?

12:42.490 --> 12:45.570
This old thing? This is
just my knock-around clothes.

12:45.990 --> 12:48.930
So, what's the story
on Gail? Bad breakup?

12:48.940 --> 12:51.230
- Something like that.
- So, she's on the rebound.

12:51.240 --> 12:52.680
Where you going with this, Alan?

12:52.710 --> 12:54.810
Oh, nowhere, I'm just curious about her.

12:54.820 --> 12:58.360
And, you know, when we met last night, I
- I sensed a little spark between us.

12:58.740 --> 13:02.310
If there was a spark, it's only
'cause she was warming up her taser.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.260
Ha-ha, very funny.

13:05.280 --> 13:09.160
Alan, trust me, the only way you're gonna hook
up with someone like Gail is in your dreams.

13:09.170 --> 13:11.160
Already did.

13:11.380 --> 13:15.570
- Really? Was Chelsea there?
- No! Good lord! How creepy would that be?

13:18.040 --> 13:20.380
Well, regardless, forget about Gail.

13:20.420 --> 13:23.200
Potato head out there has
a better shot than you do.

13:24.030 --> 13:27.470
You know,I've got a nephew about your age.
You should meet him. He plays guitar, too.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.290
Maybe you guys could jam sometime.

13:30.250 --> 13:32.870
Boobies.

13:35.810 --> 13:38.720
Hey, for your information, there is a
very good chance that a woman like that

13:38.730 --> 13:43.660
is tired of rich, handsome, successful guys who
have their own homes and recently built cars.

13:43.670 --> 13:47.080
- You really believe that?
- I have to.

13:47.970 --> 13:50.550
Woof! Who's that?

13:50.560 --> 13:54.570
Chelsea's friend. She's going through a bad breakup
so she's going to stay here for a few days...

13:55.400 --> 13:57.890
Too bad I prefer the fellas.

13:59.630 --> 14:03.180
Then again, I can always
draw a moustache on her.

14:17.350 --> 14:19.290
Alan?

14:19.300 --> 14:21.360
Jake?

14:21.840 --> 14:24.460
Bertha?

14:26.100 --> 14:31.710
Oh, boy. Although, maybe
this is another dream.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.650
- Gail, you okay?
- I'm fine.

14:42.660 --> 14:44.930
Good. Good.

14:45.190 --> 14:48.260
I'm going to run some errands. Can
I get you anything while I'm out?

14:48.270 --> 14:51.260
A reason to live.

14:52.940 --> 14:55.090
All righty.

15:01.420 --> 15:03.630
Coming in.

15:05.980 --> 15:09.600
Sorry. I just got some bad news.

15:09.610 --> 15:11.180
What happened?

15:11.210 --> 15:14.010
- My boyfriend...
- Rufus?

15:14.020 --> 15:16.300
That's my dog.

15:16.310 --> 15:18.720
Oh, yeah. He's okay, right?

15:18.730 --> 15:20.680
He's fine.

15:20.710 --> 15:23.820
I just found out Brian is
already seeing someone else.

15:23.830 --> 15:25.140
no.

15:25.180 --> 15:28.980
I mean, we just broke up and he's
already sleeping with another woman?

15:29.010 --> 15:31.350
The pig!

15:31.980 --> 15:34.650
I thought we had something.

15:35.080 --> 15:39.520
He always said I was his soul mate and that he
wanted to spend the rest of his life with me...

15:39.530 --> 15:41.260
This can't be a dream.

15:41.290 --> 15:43.400
She's still got her clothes on.

15:43.830 --> 15:46.420
And she's talking.

15:47.140 --> 15:51.460
- Why can't I find a nice guy like you?
- Absolutely.

15:52.700 --> 15:55.080
Maybe Chelsea would let me borrow you.

16:00.170 --> 16:02.660
Excuse me, gotta pee.

16:04.550 --> 16:07.210
Oh, crap, crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap, crap.

16:07.220 --> 16:09.360
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

16:11.160 --> 16:12.990
I don't know how much
longer I can hold out.

16:13.010 --> 16:15.720
I hear you.

16:15.730 --> 16:17.840
- What?
- Nothing.

16:19.700 --> 16:22.710
I gotta get Gail out of here before
I do something I'm going to regret.

16:23.180 --> 16:25.860
You know, after I thoroughly enjoy it.

16:27.300 --> 16:28.870
Just tell her to leave.

16:28.900 --> 16:31.350
I can't do that. She's
Chelsea's best friend.

16:31.360 --> 16:34.330
- They were college room-mates.
- Really?

16:35.670 --> 16:37.880
You think they experimented?

16:37.890 --> 16:39.890
Oh, yeah.

16:45.820 --> 16:48.780
I gotta figure out a way to
get Gail to leave on her own.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.230
You got the perfect tool for the job.

16:51.540 --> 16:52.860
What are you talking about?

16:52.880 --> 16:56.030
The one tool that's guaranteed to
drive any woman out of your house.

16:56.040 --> 16:58.340
Hello.

17:00.260 --> 17:03.180
Oh, look, it's an Allen wrench.

17:06.760 --> 17:09.400
- What was that about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

17:09.410 --> 17:13.380
I was just telling Berta that maybe I was
wrong about you not having a shot with Gail.

17:13.390 --> 17:16.180
why? Did she say something?
Did she ask about me?

17:16.520 --> 17:20.170
How would you feel about a double wedding?
I mean, as long as you're paying for one.

17:20.630 --> 17:23.569
Slow down, slow down.
Nobody said anything.

17:23.829 --> 17:28.520
I just realized I might've been jealous 'cause
she's so beautiful and if I can't have her,

17:28.560 --> 17:30.180
I didn't want you to have her either.

17:30.390 --> 17:33.090
Yeah, I was thinking it might be that.

17:34.350 --> 17:37.520
Anyway, it's not fair for me to
stand in the way of your happiness.

17:37.530 --> 17:40.350
Really? I always thought that
was one of your favorite things.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.930
Do you want to pick nits or do you
want to go talk to a beautiful woman

17:42.950 --> 17:46.470
who's extremely vulnerable and may
very well be looking for revenge sex?

17:46.510 --> 17:50.750
I don't want revenge sex, I want a loving
relationship that has depth and meaning

17:50.760 --> 17:52.690
and that will withstand
the test of time.

17:52.710 --> 17:55.330
Oh, that's good. I'd lead with that.

17:55.710 --> 17:58.480
- You think?
- Oh, yeah, go get her.

17:58.490 --> 18:00.970
All right. All right. Wish me luck.

18:00.980 --> 18:05.080
You don't need luck. You've got the
exact skills need to get this job done.

18:05.360 --> 18:08.640
Thanks, Charlie. You're a good brother.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.310
If he actually gets laid,
I'm going to hang myself.

18:14.590 --> 18:16.780
Come in.

18:17.610 --> 18:19.770
- Hey, there.
- Hi, Alan.

18:20.070 --> 18:22.060
You, uh,up for a little company?

18:22.270 --> 18:24.510
I guess.

18:26.060 --> 18:29.010
You know, it does get easier.

18:29.020 --> 18:32.550
- The wound does heal.
- I know. Thank you.

18:32.560 --> 18:35.830
I mean, it may not feel like
it now, but before too long,

18:35.850 --> 18:41.270
you'll forget all about that fella who hurt
you, because another fella will be in your heart.

18:41.990 --> 18:44.540
A fella who'll never hurt you.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.990
Who'll never leave your side.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.600
A fella who wants nothing
more than to love you...

18:52.610 --> 18:55.360
Oh, dear god, no.

18:57.980 --> 19:00.580
Thanks for your hospitality, Charlie,
but I should get back home.

19:00.590 --> 19:01.490
Any time.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.540
So where'd we leave it? Uh,I'll
call you, you'll call me?

19:03.550 --> 19:06.000
I'll call you.

19:08.020 --> 19:11.940
So... How'd it go?

19:13.050 --> 19:16.560
You heard her. She's gonna call me.

19:22.740 --> 19:24.820
Shame on you, Alan harper.

19:24.850 --> 19:27.420
You knew very well that Gail was
going through a difficult time.

19:27.450 --> 19:31.140
So what do you do? You try to take
advantage, to-to exploit her vulnerability...

19:31.150 --> 19:34.640
What is it about an angry
woman that I find so hot?

19:36.380 --> 19:40.920
Even when that fat cashier at the supermarket
was yelling at me, I got a little engorged.

19:42.690 --> 19:45.930
Boy, if I could just find
somebody like Chelsea.

19:45.940 --> 19:50.920
I mean, look at her go.
She's a real fireball.

19:52.160 --> 19:57.250
Speaking of fireballs, next time I manscape
I should probably skip the aftershave.
