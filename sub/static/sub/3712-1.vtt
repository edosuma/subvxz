<i>Hi. I'm Jim Brooks, and I'm sitting here</i>
<i>with Richard Marks...</i>

00:21.400 --> 00:24.198
<i>Hi. I'm Jim Brooks, and I'm sitting here</i>
<i>with Richard Marks...</i>

00:24.400 --> 00:27.198
<i>and Tia Nolan, who edited the film...</i>

00:27.280 --> 00:29.589
<i>and we actually just sat down</i>
<i>and began running it.</i>

00:29.680 --> 00:32.752
<i>What's the date? It's about a month</i>
<i>after the picture came out.</i>

00:32.840 --> 00:34.239
<i>Yeah. Just about.</i>

00:34.320 --> 00:38.029
...is Mother Teresa, whose example
helped me overcome the arrogance...

00:38.840 --> 00:41.559
<i>I just wanted to ease into it.</i>

00:41.640 --> 00:44.313
<i>But this first section that we're looking at...</i>

00:44.400 --> 00:49.190
<i>maybe there'll be room for ease later.</i>
<i>This first section was actually a re-shoot...</i>

00:49.360 --> 00:52.875
<i>because one of</i>
<i>the great problems we faced...</i>

00:52.960 --> 00:56.475
<i>was the beginning of the picture</i>
<i>and setting the tone for the picture.</i>

00:56.840 --> 01:01.356
Most influential person: My mother.
No contest.

01:03.440 --> 01:06.398
I think I have been pointing
toward this essay...

01:06.480 --> 01:10.917
ever since the day, 12 years ago in Mexico,
when my father left.

01:13.400 --> 01:17.916
<i>We could talk for months, I think,</i>
<i>about the opening of this film...</i>

01:18.600 --> 01:21.353
<i>and so much is contained in it.</i>

01:21.880 --> 01:24.713
<i>There was one of the commitments</i>
<i>the picture always had...</i>

01:24.800 --> 01:28.793
<i>which was to make sure that</i>
<i>the whole picture was from her perspective.</i>

01:34.680 --> 01:36.033
<i>This shot...</i>

01:36.920 --> 01:38.831
<i>which we thought gave us tone...</i>

01:38.920 --> 01:43.198
<i>was a pick-up shot, sort of a goofy idea</i>
<i>just between takes...</i>

01:43.600 --> 01:46.478
<i>and it ended up being what we built around.</i>

01:46.560 --> 01:51.270
<i>Originally we were going to do something</i>
<i>like 12 to 15 minutes of her in Mexico...</i>

01:53.560 --> 01:56.632
<i>just to commit to her perspective...</i>

01:56.720 --> 01:58.870
<i>and also, it was always</i>
<i>my worst nightmare...</i>

01:58.960 --> 02:00.518
<i>that we'd have to have subtitles.</i>

02:00.600 --> 02:03.512
<i>So there's nothing wrong with your set,</i>
<i>there are no subtitles.</i>

02:03.600 --> 02:07.036
<i>I thought that's the only way to start</i>
<i>to begin being honest about this.</i>

02:07.120 --> 02:10.078
Finally, she sensed
our last opportunity for change.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.469
<i>You guys must remember every cut and...</i>

02:12.560 --> 02:13.709
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:15.480 --> 02:18.711
<i>But it's amazing how much we were able</i>
<i>to say about her...</i>

02:18.800 --> 02:22.190
<i>with so little of what was originally there.</i>

02:22.720 --> 02:24.950
<i>We were able to identify with her</i>
<i>pretty early on.</i>

02:25.040 --> 02:27.793
<i>Also, I think with that opening shot...</i>

02:27.880 --> 02:30.917
<i>Iooking over the applications...</i>

02:31.000 --> 02:34.390
<i>was also meant to help clarify...</i>

02:34.480 --> 02:37.438
<i>exactly who was the narrator of the film.</i>

02:41.720 --> 02:44.439
<i>Hans Zimmer's theme,</i>
<i>which happened in his head...</i>

02:44.520 --> 02:46.158
<i>before we even started shooting...</i>

02:46.240 --> 02:49.710
<i>and I don't think he ever varied from it,</i>
<i>this was always gonna be his theme.</i>

02:49.800 --> 02:51.028
...United States was...

02:51.520 --> 02:52.953
economy class.

02:53.280 --> 02:55.669
<i>I think the thing</i>
<i>that we'd all like to do here...</i>

02:55.760 --> 02:57.751
<i>and I'd like us all to do is, you know...</i>

02:57.840 --> 03:01.310
<i>without mentioning genitalia, be as honest</i>
<i>about the making of the picture...</i>

03:01.400 --> 03:02.879
<i>as possible.</i>

03:03.760 --> 03:05.239
So we rolled through Texas...

03:07.160 --> 03:09.230
<i>I think you've silenced us.</i>

03:09.600 --> 03:11.830
<i>I took away your first comment.</i>

03:12.000 --> 03:13.911
<i>Yes, I think we're done now.</i>

03:14.880 --> 03:17.474
...look at the Detroit Pistons.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.512
<i>I always loved the people,</i>
<i>the LA people talking.</i>

03:21.800 --> 03:23.358
<i>The shock of...</i>

03:24.160 --> 03:25.878
<i>the nonsense that we talk about.</i>

03:25.960 --> 03:28.793
You got a bunch of psychotic...

03:30.080 --> 03:32.640
<i>One of the biggest challenges</i>
<i>at the beginning of this...</i>

03:32.720 --> 03:36.998
<i>was making this whole Spanish section,</i>
<i>the introduction to LA...</i>

03:37.280 --> 03:39.032
<i>to compress it...</i>

03:39.120 --> 03:42.999
<i>to compress the events</i>
<i>so that we got the sense of journey...</i>

03:43.840 --> 03:45.796
<i>from their life in Mexico...</i>

03:45.880 --> 03:48.633
<i>to this upcoming life in Los Angeles.</i>

03:48.720 --> 03:50.631
...Monica, gave us shelter.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.391
For the next six years...

03:54.480 --> 03:57.631
neither of us ventured outside
our new community.

03:59.040 --> 04:03.238
Mum worked two jobs,
paying a total of $450 a week...

04:05.960 --> 04:09.635
each of us doing everything we could
to make things work.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.473
<i>There are just so many avenues open</i>
<i>to make quick money...</i>

04:12.560 --> 04:15.233
<i>if you're a single parent</i>
<i>and you don't speak the language.</i>

04:18.079 --> 04:21.516
<i>And Paz Vega, there's no exaggerating</i>
<i>how many people we looked at...</i>

04:21.600 --> 04:26.310
<i>how many countries we contacted,</i>
<i>we looked in, to find her.</i>

04:28.800 --> 04:31.268
<i>And this girl here, Shelbie Bruce...</i>

04:31.400 --> 04:33.789
<i>I'm gonna call your attention to her</i>
<i>a few times...</i>

04:33.880 --> 04:36.314
<i>it's a miracle, this kid.</i>

04:37.680 --> 04:40.672
<i>She was 11 years old</i>
<i>when she did the picture...</i>

04:40.960 --> 04:44.157
<i>she'd never done, really,</i>
<i>any professional acting before.</i>

04:44.240 --> 04:47.357
<i>And you'll just start to see it.</i>
<i>I'll point it out from time to time.</i>

04:47.440 --> 04:51.035
She needed $450 from one job.

04:51.680 --> 04:55.195
And that meant,
after all her time in America...

04:59.080 --> 05:01.520
<i>So this is what,</i>
<i>about 4 minutes of film, guys?</i>

05:01.520 --> 05:02.157
<i>So this is what,</i>
<i>about 4 minutes of film, guys?</i>

05:02.320 --> 05:05.198
<i>This was envisioned</i>
<i>maybe as 15 minutes of film.</i>

05:05.280 --> 05:06.713
<i>This at one time was 8 minutes.</i>

05:06.800 --> 05:08.791
<i>This was months and months of...</i>

05:08.880 --> 05:10.393
<i>This was...</i>

05:12.160 --> 05:15.994
<i>I guess more time was spent on editing</i>
<i>this 4 minutes down to this 4 minutes...</i>

05:16.080 --> 05:17.593
<i>than anything we did.</i>

05:17.680 --> 05:21.639
<i>This and, really, the next scene,</i>
<i>is what we spent most...</i>

05:21.720 --> 05:24.439
<i>And that was folly,</i>
<i>the time spent on the next scene...</i>

05:24.520 --> 05:25.919
<i>you know, I think.</i>

05:26.000 --> 05:27.672
Holding out had helped though.

05:31.320 --> 05:33.595
She was no longer intimidated.

05:36.120 --> 05:39.157
Working for Anglos
now posed no problems.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.352
It would just be a job.

05:42.520 --> 05:44.590
<i>This was based on a painting...</i>

05:45.120 --> 05:47.350
<i>D.J. Hall, a California artist.</i>

05:49.280 --> 05:50.759
<i>We reproduced one of her paintings.</i>

05:50.840 --> 05:53.400
<i>She kept on doing upscale women</i>
<i>of a certain kind...</i>

05:53.480 --> 05:55.038
<i>that we replicated for that.</i>

05:55.120 --> 05:56.917
<i>And that moment when she hit the door...</i>

05:57.000 --> 05:59.833
<i>was always where we breathed easy</i>
<i>in the preview.</i>

05:59.920 --> 06:01.592
<i>And there were 13 previews we did...</i>

06:01.680 --> 06:04.558
<i>which is a part of the story we may get to.</i>

06:05.600 --> 06:09.309
<i>But always that huge laugh</i>
<i>was the best feeling in the world.</i>

06:10.640 --> 06:12.756
What does that matter
when your nose is bleeding?

06:12.840 --> 06:15.115
- Shut up, Deborah.
- Now you got it, Mum.

06:15.520 --> 06:18.557
- There's no ice pack, Bern!
- So get anything frozen.

06:18.640 --> 06:20.949
<i>Cloris came in very late in the filming...</i>

06:21.040 --> 06:23.838
<i>when Anne Bancroft, who was wonderful...</i>

06:23.920 --> 06:26.036
<i>was taken ill and she had to have</i>
<i>an operation.</i>

06:26.120 --> 06:27.189
<i>She's fine now.</i>

06:27.280 --> 06:30.670
<i>But Cloris replaced her and that changed</i>
<i>the tone of the picture as well.</i>

06:32.040 --> 06:33.393
<i>Now, Téa...</i>

06:33.920 --> 06:35.831
<i>I always think we got into a crazy thing...</i>

06:35.920 --> 06:39.390
<i>'cause people started to write about</i>
<i>difficulty between Téa and myself...</i>

06:39.480 --> 06:40.629
<i>when we were still filming...</i>

06:40.720 --> 06:44.110
<i>and when we were finding the character</i>
<i>that you're seeing her do here...</i>

06:44.200 --> 06:47.158
<i>you know, sort of, almost impossible to nail.</i>

06:47.280 --> 06:49.669
<i>And what happened is</i>
<i>there was a very hard process...</i>

06:49.760 --> 06:52.399
<i>where not only Téa's talent</i>
<i>came to the fore...</i>

06:52.480 --> 06:54.277
<i>but her gut-check...</i>

06:54.360 --> 06:56.237
<i>her ability to gut-check came to the fore.</i>

06:56.320 --> 06:59.118
<i>There's never been a character</i>
<i>like the one she plays here...</i>

06:59.200 --> 07:00.428
<i>as far as I'm concerned.</i>

07:00.520 --> 07:03.273
<i>She had a thread and needle</i>
<i>that we couldn't see.</i>

07:03.560 --> 07:06.120
<i>She's truly amazing,</i>
<i>I have to say she's probably...</i>

07:06.200 --> 07:07.838
<i>my favourite character in the movie...</i>

07:07.920 --> 07:09.876
<i>because she's got so many...</i>

07:10.560 --> 07:12.516
<i>complexities. She may be...</i>

07:13.360 --> 07:17.273
<i>dark and not nice to her children...</i>

07:18.960 --> 07:21.633
<i>but she's vulnerable, too,</i>
<i>and you can see that in this scene.</i>

07:21.720 --> 07:25.110
<i>I always felt, not a mean bone in her body,</i>
<i>but there's something...</i>

07:25.200 --> 07:27.236
<i>that I won't be able to get to in this DVD.</i>

07:27.320 --> 07:30.835
<i>There's something</i>
<i>that I even should not comment on.</i>

07:31.080 --> 07:34.356
<i>But there's something</i>
<i>in doing an American career woman...</i>

07:34.440 --> 07:36.476
<i>from this perspective...</i>

07:36.560 --> 07:41.111
<i>at a time where most career women</i>
<i>carry around this load of guilt...</i>

07:41.200 --> 07:43.668
<i>which she plays every second,</i>
<i>her load of guilt...</i>

07:43.760 --> 07:45.159
<i>and don't quite wanna look at it.</i>

07:45.240 --> 07:48.232
<i>There's still the myth</i>
<i>that you can be the perfect career mum...</i>

07:48.320 --> 07:50.231
<i>and the perfect mum at the same time.</i>

07:50.320 --> 07:53.869
<i>And this is a woman who lives nakedly</i>
<i>with the price you have to pay...</i>

07:53.960 --> 07:55.552
<i>when you try and do both those things.</i>

07:55.640 --> 07:59.349
<i>And that turns out, I think,</i>
<i>to be very sociopolitical and...</i>

07:59.520 --> 08:02.080
<i>"watch it," which is a word for:</i>
<i>"Watch it, buddy."</i>

08:05.240 --> 08:07.117
<i>Maybe that's why I like her so much.</i>

08:10.120 --> 08:12.156
Okay, let's just talk.

08:14.360 --> 08:17.432
<i>The woman playing Monica, Cecilia Suárez...</i>

08:17.520 --> 08:20.717
<i>is one of the great actresses in Mexico.</i>

08:21.760 --> 08:24.399
Yes. No. Not right now. Why?
How do you know to ask that?

08:24.480 --> 08:26.232
It's okay. I can talk about it. I just...

08:26.320 --> 08:28.880
I ran a commercial design company
until four months ago...

08:28.960 --> 08:30.154
when it was downsized to zip.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.038
- Now I'm a full-time mum. Gulp!
- Double gulp.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.280
<i>Sarah Steele, the girl who just did</i>
<i>"double gulp."</i>

08:37.360 --> 08:40.113
<i>Maybe 2,000 kids looked at.</i>

08:40.600 --> 08:42.078
<i>Despaired of finding her.</i>

08:43.080 --> 08:45.310
It's all about first names
and closeness here.

08:47.080 --> 08:49.719
<i>Here's what I said before about folly.</i>

08:50.160 --> 08:51.593
<i>This scene...</i>

08:51.720 --> 08:54.792
<i>I think there might be a piece</i>
<i>we show you later, I'm not sure...</i>

08:54.880 --> 08:57.599
<i>that wasn't in it, it was a longer scene</i>
<i>than you're seeing.</i>

08:57.680 --> 08:59.750
<i>As it is, it's an extraordinarily long scene...</i>

08:59.840 --> 09:03.230
<i>and I always thought of the picture</i>
<i>as resting on some pylons of scenes.</i>

09:03.320 --> 09:04.639
<i>This being one of them.</i>

09:04.720 --> 09:05.914
<i>Now here's a tip.</i>

09:06.000 --> 09:08.560
<i>I don't know how many tips will happen</i>
<i>during this DVD...</i>

09:08.640 --> 09:10.835
<i>but here's a tip.</i>

09:11.480 --> 09:14.870
<i>And I sort of know this rule,</i>
<i>but I sort of violate it a little here.</i>

09:14.960 --> 09:16.109
Flor.

09:17.160 --> 09:20.277
<i>It's crucial when you show what</i>
<i>to an outsider.</i>

09:20.360 --> 09:24.194
<i>It's one of the big decisions you make.</i>
<i>You gotta make sure you're ready for it.</i>

09:24.280 --> 09:27.511
<i>You gotta make sure you've reached</i>
<i>your own attitudes before you do it.</i>

09:27.600 --> 09:29.272
<i>I showed a version of this scene...</i>

09:29.360 --> 09:31.669
<i>very early in the game, to an outsider...</i>

09:31.760 --> 09:33.637
<i>who didn't like the scene at all.</i>

09:33.720 --> 09:37.599
<i>And then we spent, on the basis of that,</i>
<i>being so jolted by that...</i>

09:37.680 --> 09:40.114
<i>we spent weeks editing the scene...</i>

09:40.200 --> 09:42.634
<i>which, after all these previews</i>
<i>I'm convinced...</i>

09:42.720 --> 09:44.597
<i>would have worked in any form we had it.</i>

09:44.680 --> 09:47.831
<i>That becomes considerable</i>
<i>because we were up against a release date.</i>

09:47.920 --> 09:50.832
<i>Not that there's not anything I'd change</i>
<i>in the film that much...</i>

09:50.920 --> 09:53.593
<i>but it was just where time</i>
<i>got away from us...</i>

09:53.680 --> 09:55.557
<i>for a reason that wasn't profitable.</i>

09:55.640 --> 09:58.473
<i>And I lay it to that reason:</i>
<i>When you show what to who.</i>

10:00.320 --> 10:01.639
<i>- Pretty honest, huh?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

10:01.720 --> 10:03.233
<i>That's pretty honest.</i>

10:03.920 --> 10:06.798
<i>This is also still the introduction</i>
<i>of all these characters...</i>

10:06.880 --> 10:08.313
<i>and it's important...</i>

10:08.960 --> 10:12.350
<i>when you're looking at footage</i>
<i>and cutting a movie, to be...</i>

10:13.120 --> 10:16.874
<i>precise with how you introduce people</i>
<i>and not stay too long with them...</i>

10:16.960 --> 10:18.359
<i>or show too little.</i>

10:18.440 --> 10:21.637
<i>You wanna give just enough</i>
<i>so that the audience can get into the story.</i>

10:21.720 --> 10:25.395
<i>I think we were worried about that, too.</i>
<i>"Were we giving too much, too little?"</i>

10:25.520 --> 10:27.511
<i>Yeah, and they got her</i>
<i>with her first comments.</i>

10:27.600 --> 10:30.592
<i>And they got her. They got Deborah.</i>

10:31.080 --> 10:34.550
<i>They got her, I think, in some strange way</i>
<i>that we were always hoping for.</i>

10:34.640 --> 10:36.232
<i>They embraced her.</i>

10:36.320 --> 10:39.869
<i>And we did spend time trying to figure out...</i>

10:39.960 --> 10:43.157
<i>how to tone her down,</i>
<i>and played with that tone.</i>

10:43.680 --> 10:44.999
<i>And there was a lot of stuff.</i>

10:45.080 --> 10:47.799
<i>At one point, one of the things</i>
<i>I hated cutting out...</i>

10:47.880 --> 10:49.359
<i>but there was "mean" in it...</i>

10:49.440 --> 10:51.954
<i>and the character we ended up with</i>
<i>had no "mean" in it...</i>

10:52.040 --> 10:53.871
<i>but a defensive kind of mean...</i>

10:53.960 --> 10:56.315
<i>where she pretended to speak Spanish</i>
<i>at one moment...</i>

10:56.400 --> 10:59.756
<i>just after they had said something horrible</i>
<i>about her in Spanish.</i>

11:03.040 --> 11:06.715
<i>It was mean, but she was</i>
<i>also very vulnerable.</i>

11:06.920 --> 11:10.196
<i>And it's just the fact that we're saying</i>
<i>those words simultaneously...</i>

11:10.280 --> 11:12.350
<i>which is one of the hard things</i>
<i>Téa had to play.</i>

11:12.440 --> 11:13.953
Welcome to the family.

11:17.120 --> 11:20.590
<i>I mean, people throw those words like</i>
<i>"brave" and, you know...</i>

11:20.760 --> 11:21.954
<i>"letting the character speak."</i>

11:22.040 --> 11:24.600
<i>Every cliché you say is agony to get to,</i>
<i>and Téa got there.</i>

11:24.840 --> 11:26.717
<i>It was just a remarkably brave performance.</i>

11:26.800 --> 11:30.793
I had never known that my mother
had been chronically worried about money...

11:30.880 --> 11:34.793
until the first glimpse of her
as financially unburdened.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.348
<i>Okay, now, just let me, just...</i>

11:37.440 --> 11:40.318
<i>Look at Shelbie, the kid,</i>
<i>and look how free she is.</i>

11:40.400 --> 11:43.551
<i>Look how she wants to be in a movie,</i>
<i>look how natural she is.</i>

11:43.640 --> 11:44.789
<i>It's not allowed.</i>

11:44.880 --> 11:48.350
<i>It's not allowed to be doing</i>
<i>one of the first scenes in your life...</i>

11:48.440 --> 11:50.476
<i>and being this lifelike.</i>

11:50.560 --> 11:51.754
Is this good?

11:53.160 --> 11:54.912
<i>- Gracias.</i>
- You're welcome.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.315
Here you go.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.715
Enjoy.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.438
<i>- Gracias.</i>
- You're welcome.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.432
<i>I guess we'd all have bet at one point...</i>

12:06.520 --> 12:08.795
<i>this scene wouldn't have been</i>
<i>in the final picture...</i>

12:08.880 --> 12:11.394
<i>but without it, you didn't see her</i>
<i>with her child enough.</i>

12:11.480 --> 12:13.630
<i>I mean, we felt there was</i>
<i>critical mass on that.</i>

12:13.720 --> 12:15.995
<i>Also, it's one of the few times in the movie...</i>

12:16.080 --> 12:19.675
<i>at least early on, where we see her</i>
<i>kind of young and happy.</i>

12:19.840 --> 12:23.116
<i>And it's important</i>
<i>because she gets that way later on.</i>

12:23.200 --> 12:25.395
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- It's nice to see the contrast.</i>

12:25.480 --> 12:27.869
<i>Yeah, the heroine, which was tricky here...</i>

12:27.960 --> 12:30.428
<i>the heroine was a stern, dedicated heroine...</i>

12:30.520 --> 12:34.229
<i>who knew life was tough and was willing</i>
<i>to make any sacrifice naturally...</i>

12:34.320 --> 12:35.958
<i>just for the survival of her kid.</i>

12:36.040 --> 12:39.510
<i>And that's cultural. I mean,</i>
<i>that's not special, not particularly heroic...</i>

12:39.600 --> 12:41.033
<i>it had to be culturally heroic...</i>

12:41.120 --> 12:44.590
<i>'cause that's the kind of mothers</i>
<i>that, you know, that are in the culture.</i>

12:47.120 --> 12:50.032
<i>Also, this was really the first scene</i>
<i>in the movie...</i>

12:50.120 --> 12:53.112
<i>where she's actively translating</i>
<i>for her mother.</i>

12:53.200 --> 12:57.716
<i>And every time we tried to either</i>
<i>reduce the scene or take it out...</i>

12:58.120 --> 13:00.236
<i>- we missed it terribly.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

13:00.320 --> 13:02.038
My mother said to tell them...

13:02.120 --> 13:05.157
<i>That was one of the things that happened</i>
<i>in all the research we did.</i>

13:05.240 --> 13:08.437
<i>You know, I don't speak Spanish.</i>

13:08.520 --> 13:11.080
<i>People I was interviewing</i>
<i>and trying to talk to...</i>

13:11.160 --> 13:14.516
<i>spoke Spanish and sometimes</i>
<i>brought their kids who translated for them...</i>

13:14.600 --> 13:17.239
<i>and then we got into what that dynamic was.</i>

13:24.560 --> 13:26.630
<i>And you just see where the focus was.</i>

13:26.720 --> 13:30.633
<i>What we're not gonna talk about is how</i>
<i>we got that leather thing they're sitting on...</i>

13:30.720 --> 13:30.760
<i>and the colour...</i>
<i>You're not gonna hear that in this.</i>

13:30.760 --> 13:33.479
<i>And the colour...</i>
<i>You're not gonna hear that in this.</i>

13:34.400 --> 13:35.469
Left!

13:36.440 --> 13:38.032
<i>It was always the idea...</i>

13:38.120 --> 13:40.190
<i>impossible to do a picture</i>
<i>about Los Angeles...</i>

13:40.280 --> 13:44.159
<i>maybe possible to do a picture on</i>
<i>a few blocks that you focused on...</i>

13:44.240 --> 13:45.832
<i>this being the prime one.</i>

13:55.520 --> 13:59.035
<i>Okay, here's my version of:</i>
<i>"We really needed a leather couch."</i>

13:59.120 --> 14:01.111
<i>That French toast you just saw.</i>

14:01.200 --> 14:05.910
<i>Created by Thomas Keller,</i>
<i>arguably the best chef in the world.</i>

14:06.000 --> 14:08.036
<i>Been called that in print a lot.</i>

14:08.320 --> 14:10.515
<i>And he had to make great French toast.</i>

14:11.240 --> 14:15.552
<i>And what he did is,</i>
<i>he put cornflakes on top of it...</i>

14:15.640 --> 14:18.313
<i>and what he put in it was chocolate and...</i>

14:18.400 --> 14:21.995
<i>I think chocolate and cream cheese</i>
<i>and almonds...</i>

14:22.080 --> 14:24.719
<i>and lots of butter.</i>

14:25.720 --> 14:26.994
- Yes.
- Okay.

14:30.880 --> 14:34.714
<i>This is a scene</i>
<i>that we did a lot of playing with.</i>

14:37.760 --> 14:39.239
I'm glad you like it.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.231
But you could do without this.

14:46.600 --> 14:49.637
<i>We had a broader version of this</i>
<i>where she tried too hard...</i>

14:49.720 --> 14:52.280
<i>to make her daughter feel good</i>
<i>about what she had cooked...</i>

14:52.360 --> 14:55.432
<i>and went wildly over the top in trying to be</i>
<i>a supportive mother...</i>

14:55.520 --> 14:56.555
<i>that was sort of comic.</i>

14:56.640 --> 14:58.392
<i>And we had one that was much shorter...</i>

14:58.480 --> 15:00.914
<i>where you just saw the dagger go</i>
<i>in the kid's heart.</i>

15:01.000 --> 15:03.116
<i>And she was, of course, unmindful of it.</i>

15:03.720 --> 15:05.233
Okay. It's just...

15:05.320 --> 15:08.869
no taking the ball from the dog.
Just don't. No fetch.

15:08.960 --> 15:13.033
No. Never do fetch with this dog.
Okay? Never.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.031
<i>But here was the key thing:</i>

15:16.640 --> 15:20.189
<i>Getting permission to start to present</i>
<i>these people and move them along.</i>

15:21.560 --> 15:23.994
<i>And the story's gonna catch up with you.</i>

15:26.240 --> 15:30.438
<i>So everything in the picture at this point</i>
<i>is to make the people the story.</i>

15:30.520 --> 15:34.069
<i>It was by design that Adam would</i>
<i>make a very late entrance in the movie...</i>

15:34.160 --> 15:35.798
<i>even later than this, at one point.</i>

15:35.880 --> 15:36.949
Hey, Dad!

15:38.400 --> 15:41.472
Are you as mad at me as Mum
'cause of what happened?

15:48.160 --> 15:49.912
No, Georgie, I'm not.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.112
Are you mad at me?

15:54.080 --> 15:55.672
- No.
- Good.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.439
Let's hope.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.710
When it comes to the kids, John,
we got to stay on the same page!

16:01.800 --> 16:04.473
<i>This was a re-shoot.</i>
<i>There was a big commitment...</i>

16:04.560 --> 16:07.677
<i>to do a real married argument.</i>

16:08.000 --> 16:11.549
<i>There's 10 minutes, some of which</i>
<i>I might show you on added scenes...</i>

16:11.640 --> 16:14.598
<i>where we go into the details</i>
<i>of the argument, some stuff I love.</i>

16:14.680 --> 16:18.798
<i>But the idea, the story purpose was to do</i>
<i>an argument, to catch the dynamic:</i>

16:18.880 --> 16:20.950
<i>"What's wrong with this couple?"</i>

16:21.320 --> 16:22.958
"No, I'm not mad."

16:28.400 --> 16:29.674
Good guy...

16:30.400 --> 16:31.628
bad guy.

16:32.160 --> 16:34.071
<i>Which tended to resonate with everybody.</i>

16:34.160 --> 16:36.833
<i>That "good guy, bad guy."</i>
<i>That is, the dynamic in a marriage...</i>

16:36.920 --> 16:38.672
<i>is not that unfamiliar.</i>

16:39.080 --> 16:40.308
<i>Nor is this.</i>

16:45.960 --> 16:49.157
<i>You're right.</i>
<i>This is a very identifiable argument...</i>

16:49.880 --> 16:53.475
<i>which makes it easy</i>
<i>to understand these two early on.</i>

16:54.360 --> 16:57.750
<i>And like those married arguments,</i>
<i>go find right or wrong.</i>

16:57.840 --> 16:58.989
<i>Right.</i>

16:59.080 --> 17:00.149
...infuriating me.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.158
- Wrong breast.
- Oh, my God!

17:02.560 --> 17:06.314
<i>And that's the other thing</i>
<i>about Téa's character Deborah...</i>

17:06.400 --> 17:11.030
<i>is that it's not just a straight</i>
<i>bad-guy character.</i>

17:11.119 --> 17:14.510
<i>She's got things that you can identify with.</i>

17:14.599 --> 17:17.353
<i>The husband who's not understanding</i>
<i>the discipline...</i>

17:17.440 --> 17:19.829
<i>the way she wants it, that kind of thing.</i>

17:20.800 --> 17:22.028
<i>And it's a weird thing.</i>

17:22.119 --> 17:25.237
<i>Sometimes the only way we prove</i>
<i>that we love each other...</i>

17:25.319 --> 17:27.914
<i>is if we can really drive each other crazy.</i>

17:37.720 --> 17:39.836
Great God in heaven, save me.

17:43.480 --> 17:47.029
<i>And that line began an odd romance.</i>

17:47.280 --> 17:48.599
I didn't know Deb found somebody.

17:48.680 --> 17:50.398
<i>Because...</i>

17:51.840 --> 17:55.196
<i>Well, I'll get into that later.</i>
<i>But to pray for help...</i>

17:55.480 --> 17:58.995
<i>And the help he's gonna get from this girl</i>
<i>by the end of the movie...</i>

17:59.080 --> 18:01.310
<i>is some reminder of his own worth.</i>

18:02.560 --> 18:03.595
This is...

18:03.680 --> 18:07.514
<i>And this gets into a very verboten area,</i>
<i>as we discover.</i>

18:07.600 --> 18:08.919
John, this is Flor.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.195
Flor.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.477
Great. I'll take Georgie to school.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.755
<i>Now remember, what Paz is playing</i>
<i>at every moment...</i>

18:17.840 --> 18:19.910
<i>is somebody who doesn't</i>
<i>understand English...</i>

18:20.000 --> 18:22.036
<i>but you can see from...</i>

18:22.120 --> 18:25.635
<i>The reason I didn't use subtitles is</i>
<i>that you can put yourself in her shoes...</i>

18:25.720 --> 18:28.598
<i>'cause you're gonna hear the Spanish</i>
<i>and you don't quite get it.</i>

18:28.680 --> 18:32.229
<i>So you sort of feel what it is not to quite</i>
<i>get what's happening around you.</i>

18:32.320 --> 18:33.753
<i>And how much you do get.</i>

18:33.840 --> 18:36.274
You're fine. Deb?

18:36.640 --> 18:38.358
- What?
- You love me.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.959
<i>I have to say Adam is amazing</i>
<i>in this character...</i>

18:45.040 --> 18:47.031
<i>because he's so naturally this person...</i>

18:47.120 --> 18:50.476
<i>and yet we haven't seen him as this guy</i>
<i>ever before.</i>

18:50.560 --> 18:54.394
<i>The world knows him</i>
<i>as someone different, sillier...</i>

18:54.800 --> 18:56.836
<i>and yet he's comfortable...</i>

18:56.920 --> 19:00.674
<i>as this nice, good chef, nice father.</i>

19:02.320 --> 19:05.835
<i>Yeah, and it was always my sense of him</i>
<i>more than anything else...</i>

19:06.560 --> 19:10.872
<i>that the other persona for all those</i>
<i>funny movies that he did...</i>

19:10.960 --> 19:12.313
<i>is so deep.</i>

19:12.400 --> 19:14.868
<i>But this... Never a false moment for him.</i>

19:18.560 --> 19:20.790
- Damn.
- What?

19:22.120 --> 19:24.031
<i>The "what" guy is Phil Rosenthal...</i>

19:24.120 --> 19:28.830
<i>who's the creator and executive producer of</i>
Everybody Loves Raymond. <i>Very funny guy.</i>

19:29.720 --> 19:31.358
<i>Angela Goethals...</i>

19:32.320 --> 19:34.629
<i>who I'd worked with before in television,</i>
<i>and who...</i>

19:35.720 --> 19:38.917
<i>Given the number of her lines,</i>
<i>nobody ever scored bigger in a movie.</i>

19:41.400 --> 19:43.960
That's not the thing. That's not the problem.

19:45.120 --> 19:48.829
I worked at a restaurant in New York
that had four stars.

19:49.520 --> 19:52.478
It was like a line formed
to become an asshole.

19:53.280 --> 19:55.510
People's accents changed.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.279
The heart went out of the place.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.271
<i>Here's a good thing about the research...</i>

20:00.360 --> 20:02.555
<i>because there was a lot of research</i>
<i>on restaurants:</i>

20:02.640 --> 20:04.551
<i>It busted all the clichés for me.</i>

20:04.640 --> 20:07.473
<i>Noisy, crude places of temperament,</i>
<i>which might exist...</i>

20:07.560 --> 20:09.596
<i>but not Thomas Keller's kitchen.</i>

20:09.920 --> 20:14.038
<i>And not his outlook towards the profession.</i>
<i>That's what we tried to get in the picture.</i>

20:16.400 --> 20:17.753
Here we are, ladies.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.997
I don't know what to root for.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.160
The thought of one star gets me nauseous...

20:24.240 --> 20:28.552
but with four, there's no place to go but,
"My God, they took away one of my stars!"

20:28.800 --> 20:31.951
<i>- The Times</i> liked the first course.
- You know what you want?

20:33.360 --> 20:37.353
Three and a quarter stars.
Yes, that would be perfect.

20:37.960 --> 20:41.839
<i>This is also another scene we went back</i>
<i>and forth on a number of times.</i>

20:41.920 --> 20:46.198
<i>And yet it's so important to show</i>
<i>that he doesn't want to be...</i>

20:47.080 --> 20:50.868
<i>the top of his game. He just wants to be</i>
<i>at a comfortable place in everything.</i>

20:50.960 --> 20:54.475
<i>I always thought that's sort of what made</i>
<i>somebody a hero, when to say stop.</i>

20:54.560 --> 20:57.313
<i>When to say, "This is okay right here,</i>
<i>I don't need any more. "</i>

20:57.400 --> 20:58.958
<i>And, of course, he couldn't stop it.</i>

21:01.600 --> 21:04.592
<i>- That's a great pour.</i>
<i>- My favourite glass of wine.</i>

21:07.920 --> 21:12.198
I'm in the vitamin section
and this little hip-hop girl, what's her name?

21:12.280 --> 21:15.078
<i>That's great about Cloris.</i>
<i>In other words, you're about to...</i>

21:15.160 --> 21:16.957
<i>She'll call your attention in to...</i>

21:17.040 --> 21:19.952
<i>She's going to pour a glass of wine</i>
<i>and walk over to a table.</i>

21:20.040 --> 21:23.191
<i>She'll call your attention,</i>
<i>make you discuss how much of a pour...</i>

21:23.280 --> 21:25.589
<i>That's what led to that</i>
<i>and really set up the scene.</i>

21:28.960 --> 21:33.078
God bless the language barrier.
It keeps you from being bored with me.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.516
Anyway, she said:

21:37.320 --> 21:41.199
- "Aren't you Evelyn Wright?"
- Oh, my God!

21:41.280 --> 21:44.317
First of all, that she remembered me
from the old covers.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.834
- Yeah.
- And then she...

21:48.080 --> 21:51.311
- Oh, please. Her name.
- Stop it.

21:52.280 --> 21:55.590
- It makes the story so much better.
- It's still a good story.

21:55.960 --> 21:59.191
<i>We all, I think the one thing</i>
<i>the whole company had in common...</i>

21:59.880 --> 22:04.396
<i>is how much everybody ended up</i>
<i>being touched by Sarah Steele...</i>

22:04.800 --> 22:06.552
<i>who plays Bernice. Just the actress...</i>

22:06.960 --> 22:10.396
<i>she was just this enormously winning kid.</i>

22:11.080 --> 22:13.753
<i>And, I think, just perfectly cast</i>
<i>for that reason.</i>

22:13.840 --> 22:17.276
<i>It's just in her, just good kid is in her, deep.</i>

22:17.520 --> 22:21.274
Well, you think your life is embarrassing,
and then...

22:21.840 --> 22:25.116
somebody finds encouragement in it.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.269
- You understand?
- I think I do.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.835
Mum, it's not even noon.

22:37.960 --> 22:41.953
<i>The mother-daughter relationships</i>
<i>that thread throughout are great, too.</i>

22:42.040 --> 22:45.919
<i>Because you notice it, then you don't</i>
<i>notice it, and then it comes back to you.</i>

22:48.000 --> 22:50.195
<i>At a certain level it's his story...</i>

22:50.280 --> 22:53.431
<i>and it's Paz's story,</i>
<i>but the mother-daughter keeps happening.</i>

22:53.520 --> 22:55.033
<i>You know what's so interesting, too?</i>

22:55.120 --> 22:59.033
<i>The one thing everybody in the picture has</i>
<i>in common and nobody says to anybody...</i>

22:59.120 --> 23:01.270
<i>maybe Paz and Adam a little bit, is:</i>

23:01.360 --> 23:03.828
<i>"Oh, my God,</i>
<i>we're all struggling for survival. "</i>

23:03.920 --> 23:08.072
<i>Everybody, this kid is struggling</i>
<i>for survival, Cloris was in that last scene.</i>

23:08.160 --> 23:12.597
<i>They don't say, "Since we're all doing it,</i>
<i>maybe we're not that much at risk. "</i>

23:12.680 --> 23:14.432
<i>They couldn't quite share the notes.</i>

23:14.560 --> 23:15.834
Stop it.

23:17.040 --> 23:19.474
The man you're looking for is not a ruse.

23:19.560 --> 23:21.596
- What does "ruse" mean?
- Phoney.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.557
Roosevelt!

23:27.160 --> 23:30.277
If I'd ever heard of that word before,
that would lock it in.

23:30.360 --> 23:31.349
<i>Kids are great that way.</i>

23:31.440 --> 23:35.638
<i>Every moment of their lives is so extreme</i>
<i>that there's a conscious struggle of survival.</i>

23:35.720 --> 23:37.995
<i>Everything that goes wrong</i>
<i>is so devastating.</i>

23:38.600 --> 23:39.794
<i>Kids and directors.</i>

23:44.320 --> 23:46.993
I went nuts. I got so much stuff.

23:47.080 --> 23:49.355
Great! She needed a boost.

23:49.920 --> 23:54.232
<i>This was one of the most cut scenes,</i>
<i>I think, most revised scenes.</i>

23:57.640 --> 23:59.835
<i>It kept changing, you know...</i>

24:01.360 --> 24:03.635
<i>as we proceeded with the cut.</i>

24:04.840 --> 24:07.354
<i>How we wanted to focus</i>
<i>on which characters...</i>

24:07.440 --> 24:09.590
<i>and which relationships</i>
<i>we wanted to focus on.</i>

24:09.680 --> 24:12.558
<i>And this was one of these</i>
<i>multi-character scenes...</i>

24:13.040 --> 24:15.918
<i>that allows you to shift the focus as needed.</i>

24:17.000 --> 24:20.675
<i>And I think we tried it that way.</i>
<i>If we held the camera on Paz...</i>

24:21.120 --> 24:25.272
<i>and had almost everything off-camera,</i>
<i>which we did a version of at one point...</i>

24:25.360 --> 24:27.351
<i>- it's a different movie.</i>
<i>- It is, very much so.</i>

24:27.440 --> 24:31.035
<i>I think that was true no matter who</i>
<i>we put the camera on in this scene.</i>

24:32.840 --> 24:34.717
<i>It's truer than you can almost deal with.</i>

24:46.320 --> 24:48.231
<i>One of the worst lessons we all learn...</i>

24:48.320 --> 24:51.278
<i>is that when you find yourself</i>
<i>obsessing and obsessing...</i>

24:51.360 --> 24:55.990
<i>it's never improper. It's just that big a deal.</i>

24:56.400 --> 25:00.029
<i>So even as you obsess, you don't admit</i>
<i>what a big deal it is, don't you think?</i>

25:00.120 --> 25:01.838
<i>Yeah, I know, I think that's true.</i>

25:02.160 --> 25:04.549
...then I wouldn't be able to tell you that...

25:05.600 --> 25:07.830
your gift to me...

25:08.600 --> 25:09.874
is a ruse.

25:11.720 --> 25:15.315
- Honey, I...
- Please, just excuse me.

25:16.080 --> 25:17.911
- Hey, Bernie...
- I just...

25:18.720 --> 25:22.349
I just need to be alone right now, okay?
I'm sorry. It's okay.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.672
<i>Now it's amazing here,</i>
<i>in a country of fat camps...</i>

25:25.840 --> 25:29.753
<i>where there's an obesity story on</i>
<i>the front page of the paper every other day...</i>

25:30.080 --> 25:32.958
<i>how completely every audience</i>
<i>always thought...</i>

25:33.040 --> 25:35.679
<i>it was horrible to get her clothes</i>
<i>of the smaller size...</i>

25:35.760 --> 25:37.398
<i>when she was between the sizes.</i>

25:37.480 --> 25:40.119
<i>I agree with them, by the way,</i>
<i>but it's so amazing...</i>

25:40.200 --> 25:43.510
<i>how much we say, "You don't need to</i>
<i>eat that, you shouldn't eat that. "</i>

25:43.600 --> 25:46.797
We gotta be on the same page.
That's the most important thing.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.472
I don't know why it has to be so hard.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.039
I need a minute.

25:54.160 --> 25:57.755
<i>The fact that Deborah doesn't know</i>
<i>she's done anything wrong...</i>

25:59.440 --> 26:00.793
<i>is also an amazing thing.</i>

26:00.880 --> 26:03.678
<i>"She's right between the two sizes,</i>
<i>I thought about it.</i>

26:04.440 --> 26:07.637
<i>"What are we supposed to do, help her</i>
<i>denial?" She always has a case.</i>

26:08.800 --> 26:11.872
<i>I always love that she goes</i>
<i>for some woman's bond.</i>

26:12.880 --> 26:14.836
<i>With the person</i>
<i>who doesn't speak English...</i>

26:14.920 --> 26:17.480
<i>but understands just enough</i>
<i>to deplore her totally.</i>

26:22.720 --> 26:24.790
Sorry, I didn't even help you with the door.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.871
No, what I meant was...

26:27.200 --> 26:30.158
<i>Paz's facial expressions</i>
<i>just explain everything, too.</i>

26:30.240 --> 26:33.073
<i>I mean, if she didn't have that ability to...</i>

26:33.200 --> 26:35.395
<i>show so much on that beautiful face...</i>

26:35.480 --> 26:37.391
<i>we wouldn't have the story.</i>

26:40.040 --> 26:41.996
<i>And she has that, you know.</i>

26:42.120 --> 26:45.749
<i>To me, she's a notably beautiful woman,</i>
<i>Paz Vega.</i>

26:45.840 --> 26:48.308
<i>International beauty,</i>
<i>whatever the heck that means.</i>

26:48.400 --> 26:50.960
<i>I never worked with anybody</i>
<i>with beauty of that type.</i>

26:51.040 --> 26:55.750
<i>But yet, she's such a good actress</i>
<i>it never got in the way of the performance.</i>

26:55.880 --> 26:59.668
<i>You're not looking at her now saying,</i>
<i>"She's beautiful," or, "Look at those eyes."</i>

26:59.760 --> 27:02.194
<i>You're just seeing an actress</i>
<i>and you're seeing story.</i>

27:02.280 --> 27:03.474
He appeared to be a good man.

27:03.560 --> 27:05.118
<i>- Aren't you?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

27:09.280 --> 27:13.717
<i>It's also that you diffuse that beauty issue</i>
<i>in that interview scene...</i>

27:14.080 --> 27:18.551
<i>where the first thing out of Téa's mouth</i>
<i>when she meets her...</i>

27:18.720 --> 27:19.869
<i>is that, "You're gorgeous."</i>

27:20.160 --> 27:23.709
<i>It sort of embraced the fact</i>
<i>that she was gorgeous...</i>

27:23.800 --> 27:25.552
<i>and we could accept it and go beyond it.</i>

27:25.640 --> 27:27.949
<i>- And that it was irrelevant to her.</i>
<i>- Yeah, exactly.</i>

27:28.400 --> 27:30.550
What're you doing? We're still moving.

27:30.640 --> 27:33.154
I'll take you all the way to the bus stop.

27:36.120 --> 27:39.669
<i>Here's where I'm never happy with myself,</i>
<i>but it was because, you know...</i>

27:39.760 --> 27:44.276
<i>very often, art is interrupted by a reluctance</i>
<i>to hurt a young woman physically.</i>

27:48.320 --> 27:52.154
<i>If that car was moving 10 miles an hour</i>
<i>faster and she had to leap out...</i>

27:52.240 --> 27:54.196
<i>that would've been</i>
<i>exactly the right moment.</i>

27:54.280 --> 27:57.477
<i>Because the idea of risking physical danger</i>
<i>to leap out of the car...</i>

27:57.560 --> 27:59.516
<i>Man, I can't do it, I can't.</i>

28:00.800 --> 28:03.917
<i>I remember</i>
<i>when you were shooting this scene...</i>

28:04.000 --> 28:07.834
<i>and the look on Paz's face when you were</i>
<i>explaining that through the translator...</i>

28:07.920 --> 28:09.911
<i>that she had to hop out of a moving car.</i>

28:11.640 --> 28:14.200
<i>Yes, having not learnt "no stunt double" yet.</i>

28:14.280 --> 28:17.272
<i>It was actually when the two of you</i>
<i>turned away from each other...</i>

28:17.360 --> 28:20.193
<i>that look on her face of, "Oh, God."</i>

28:20.280 --> 28:22.236
<i>That'll keep the speedometer down.</i>

28:25.280 --> 28:28.556
<i>Now again, just watch Shelbie.</i>
<i>First acting job.</i>

28:30.040 --> 28:32.998
<i>Natural, nothing overplayed,</i>
<i>totally in the scene.</i>

28:34.760 --> 28:36.478
Her rules were bending.

28:36.560 --> 28:38.790
She was losing her battle
to remain uninvolved...

28:38.880 --> 28:40.233
<i>How relaxed her body is.</i>

28:48.760 --> 28:50.113
"Try it on."

28:56.920 --> 28:57.989
Try...

29:05.120 --> 29:09.875
<i>And she was the pivot. She's the danger</i>
<i>of assimilation, Shelbie, that's what...</i>

29:12.480 --> 29:13.515
<i>She's a little metaphor.</i>

29:13.600 --> 29:15.192
"Just try it on."

29:18.600 --> 29:20.158
Just try on.

29:21.120 --> 29:22.394
Just.

29:23.040 --> 29:26.589
<i>The concept of the daughter</i>
<i>teaching the mother at this age...</i>

29:26.920 --> 29:29.798
<i>is also amazing,</i>
<i>and, I'm sure, very common in this culture.</i>

29:31.960 --> 29:36.670
<i>One of the big things is, and I guess</i>
<i>it's the story of a lot of immigrants...</i>

29:37.080 --> 29:38.877
<i>the guilt the daughters carry with them...</i>

29:38.960 --> 29:41.599
<i>knowing their mothers sacrificed</i>
<i>to set them up like this.</i>

29:41.680 --> 29:44.274
<i>You know, what they had to go through</i>
<i>to give them a shot.</i>

29:44.920 --> 29:49.675
<i>And also, being truthful in that scene when</i>
<i>the mother is almost slightly annoyed...</i>

29:51.160 --> 29:54.072
<i>that her daughter knows more</i>
<i>than she does.</i>

29:54.640 --> 29:56.995
<i>We've made her a stern mother...</i>

29:57.080 --> 30:00.197
<i>but the culture has corporal punishment,</i>
<i>still, as just part of it.</i>

30:01.640 --> 30:03.870
...dieting, exercising American women...

30:03.960 --> 30:05.154
Left!

30:06.880 --> 30:09.314
<i>This hill is that hard, she is in that shape.</i>

30:10.120 --> 30:11.553
<i>She could beat those guys.</i>

30:11.760 --> 30:13.034
Left!

30:15.720 --> 30:18.917
<i>She did the most amazing amount</i>
<i>of working out in this movie, though...</i>

30:19.000 --> 30:21.070
<i>running and everything, take after take.</i>

30:25.960 --> 30:30.238
<i>I love that it happens a couple of times,</i>
<i>just the used Kleenexes in bed...</i>

30:30.960 --> 30:32.837
<i>for the people going through this story.</i>

30:44.080 --> 30:45.274
Wow!

30:49.120 --> 30:50.872
Taste, she has.

30:51.960 --> 30:53.439
Just try it on.

30:54.880 --> 30:58.156
<i>What we are in the business of doing</i>
<i>at this point, I think...</i>

30:59.160 --> 31:03.153
<i>is holding back</i>
<i>and not declaring what the story is.</i>

31:06.040 --> 31:08.793
<i>There were several stories afoot,</i>
<i>but the big one...</i>

31:08.960 --> 31:11.076
<i>is we have done a boy-meets-girl.</i>

31:11.520 --> 31:15.195
<i>It was a noisy boy-meets-girl.</i>
<i>God in heaven save me, and there's the girl.</i>

31:15.520 --> 31:17.158
<i>But holding back and holding back...</i>

31:19.320 --> 31:22.995
<i>because the people they played</i>
<i>were not aware of that story at all.</i>

31:23.080 --> 31:26.789
<i>They had no thoughts of each other at</i>
<i>this point, even though that was the story.</i>

31:27.520 --> 31:30.910
<i>So it's how much that moment is delayed</i>
<i>and beside the point...</i>

31:31.000 --> 31:32.149
<i>because it wasn't the point.</i>

31:32.240 --> 31:35.755
<i>The point was her survival with</i>
<i>her daughter, her survival in this country.</i>

31:35.840 --> 31:38.798
...and uses it to watch me grunt my way...

31:39.680 --> 31:40.908
into a...

31:53.440 --> 31:56.512
- It fits!
- Okay.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.392
<i>We'd walked some lines with this</i>
<i>when we talked to each other...</i>

32:07.480 --> 32:10.950
<i>because we'd go down one direction</i>
<i>and somebody could say, "Mary Poppins"...</i>

32:11.040 --> 32:12.439
<i>and we'd quickly reverse.</i>

32:13.440 --> 32:16.591
<i>We were so afraid of that kind of nanny,</i>
<i>which she wasn't.</i>

32:16.680 --> 32:17.908
<i>We didn't want to overplay.</i>

32:18.000 --> 32:20.195
<i>This was a job for her, it was a job.</i>

32:20.280 --> 32:23.078
<i>She was on guard against too much</i>
<i>involvement with the family.</i>

32:23.160 --> 32:24.388
<i>She had her own family.</i>

32:25.000 --> 32:27.514
<i>But it was a natural instinct to do</i>
<i>some of these things.</i>

32:27.600 --> 32:29.750
<i>Even this hug was meant to be</i>
<i>somewhat awkward...</i>

32:29.840 --> 32:31.512
<i>and they don't know what to do with it.</i>

32:33.000 --> 32:36.913
<i>To keep the barrier, to keep the truth of</i>
<i>that little invisible barrier up.</i>

32:47.240 --> 32:49.117
<i>So, Jim, how did you come up</i>
<i>with the idea...</i>

32:49.200 --> 32:53.193
<i>of having the grandmother</i>
<i>and the grandson singing old tunes?</i>

32:53.640 --> 32:57.997
<i>Well, it's this tune, too,</i> Lush Life.
<i>I mean, I still get a little perverse rush.</i>

32:59.960 --> 33:03.032
<i>The saddest, oddest,</i>
<i>most poetic bar song there is...</i>

33:04.640 --> 33:08.315
<i>about when Paris is no longer the answer</i>
<i>because life is so bad.</i>

33:08.400 --> 33:10.356
<i>And she's teaching it to an 8-year-old.</i>

33:10.480 --> 33:12.118
- Make room.
- I know.

33:12.200 --> 33:15.715
But every time he has a nightmare,
I teach him one of my old songs.

33:15.800 --> 33:18.519
That way, his nightmares have a purpose.

33:19.320 --> 33:21.754
But I don't have to sing it for anyone.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.831
Right, you're clear on that.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.910
<i>I guess it's the point of the movie...</i>

33:30.720 --> 33:32.312
<i>that alcoholism has many vices...</i>

33:32.400 --> 33:35.631
<i>but one of the side effects is</i>
<i>it makes you a damn good grandparent.</i>

33:36.760 --> 33:40.150
76,000, which is great for a jazz album.

33:40.520 --> 33:42.317
<i>I got something to look forward to.</i>

33:45.120 --> 33:46.235
<i>Trust me, it's true.</i>

33:56.800 --> 33:58.950
<i>This is it. Your future is there.</i>

34:12.480 --> 34:16.438
<i>This is the thing that makes him a hero,</i>
<i>he's about to read his review.</i>

34:17.600 --> 34:21.831
<i>The only review that could really do it</i>
<i>for him is impossible...</i>

34:22.239 --> 34:25.596
<i>and that's a headline that says,</i>
<i>"Everything stays exactly the same."</i>

34:33.800 --> 34:35.027
Fuck you.

34:36.280 --> 34:37.554
<i>I'm so glad we kept that in.</i>

34:39.679 --> 34:40.795
Dad!

34:40.880 --> 34:42.996
For Christ's sake, why are you screaming?

34:43.080 --> 34:46.117
Why, crazy father,
why aren't you screaming?

34:48.320 --> 34:51.596
I'm working on it.
The stunned thing has to get dealt with.

34:53.960 --> 34:55.188
"John Clasky..."

34:55.280 --> 34:56.793
- No.
- Yes.

34:57.440 --> 35:00.512
<i>This is in part based on,</i>
<i>I mentioned the chef Thomas Keller...</i>

35:00.600 --> 35:05.276
<i>who left the New York glitzy scene</i>
<i>when it wasn't doing it for him anymore...</i>

35:05.800 --> 35:07.870
<i>and found a small, perfect restaurant.</i>

35:07.960 --> 35:11.669
<i>The only problem was, it was so small</i>
<i>you couldn't make a real living at it...</i>

35:11.760 --> 35:14.513
<i>and opened it up in the Napa Valley,</i>
<i>the French Laundry.</i>

35:14.600 --> 35:16.477
<i>Then one day</i>
<i>the</i> New York Times <i>visited it...</i>

35:16.560 --> 35:18.994
<i>and called it the best restaurant</i>
<i>in the United States.</i>

35:19.080 --> 35:23.198
<i>And then everything changed for him.</i>
<i>But he was fine.</i>

35:23.280 --> 35:27.193
<i>He used it in a great way to do</i>
<i>what he always wanted to do with cooking.</i>

35:29.000 --> 35:30.433
<i>This guy's life is blown apart.</i>

35:32.120 --> 35:36.511
"Eating at this perfect, smaller,
passionate restaurant...

35:37.200 --> 35:39.998
"inspires one's own abandonment
of caution.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.394
"To wit...

35:45.600 --> 35:48.751
"John Clasky is the best chef
in the United States."

35:51.440 --> 35:54.432
- Look how great you read it.
- Perfect, Dad.

35:57.720 --> 36:00.632
John, four stars. Oh, my God.

36:01.480 --> 36:03.311
You even look different to me.

36:04.160 --> 36:07.072
<i>That was an audience laugh</i>
<i>that I never understood, quite.</i>

36:07.520 --> 36:10.557
<i>Cloris always got a laugh with,</i>
<i>"You even look different to me."</i>

36:13.200 --> 36:16.954
<i>I don't mean to interrupt your laugh,</i>
<i>but exactly what do you find amusing there?</i>

36:17.440 --> 36:19.396
<i>Because it does touch something, clearly.</i>

36:23.000 --> 36:26.629
<i>I think what we got out of</i>
<i>a lot of rehearsal...</i>

36:26.720 --> 36:29.280
<i>between Adam and Téa...</i>

36:29.760 --> 36:32.638
<i>is a comfort that let them</i>
<i>be loose physically with each other...</i>

36:32.720 --> 36:33.994
<i>which really helped this scene.</i>

36:34.080 --> 36:36.992
<i>I think if they had met each other</i>
<i>the week before...</i>

36:37.120 --> 36:38.997
<i>or hadn't spent time together rehearsing...</i>

36:39.080 --> 36:41.230
<i>they couldn't have had this ease</i>
<i>with each other.</i>

36:41.320 --> 36:43.515
Don't worry. I'll wait for you.

36:45.920 --> 36:48.639
<i>Because sometimes good manners</i>
<i>can get in the way of acting.</i>

36:48.720 --> 36:50.233
<i>You don't know each other that well.</i>

36:50.320 --> 36:53.756
<i>You're not sure if you should take the lead,</i>
<i>if it throws the other person.</i>

36:53.840 --> 36:55.319
<i>That's what's great about rehearsal.</i>

36:55.400 --> 36:57.550
Ladies and gentlemen,
the mother of two children!

36:57.640 --> 36:59.676
<i>How did you come up with the...</i>

36:59.760 --> 37:01.910
<i>taking the pants off with her feet?</i>

37:02.600 --> 37:04.636
<i>- Téa came up with that.</i>
<i>- Did she?</i>

37:05.160 --> 37:08.038
<i>All sorts of physical stuff,</i>
<i>she was pitching all the time.</i>

37:09.320 --> 37:11.038
<i>There's a lot of each of them in this.</i>

37:11.680 --> 37:13.272
Go.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.640
<i>To me, this starts as perfect marital sex...</i>

37:16.880 --> 37:19.189
<i>because the guy is adoring her.</i>

37:19.520 --> 37:21.988
<i>And just unconditional approval.</i>

37:22.080 --> 37:24.640
Just go. Now she's on.

37:24.920 --> 37:26.319
It's all you!

37:44.080 --> 37:47.709
<i>If he was a bachelor and this was</i>
<i>the crazy girl for a one-nighter, it's okay.</i>

37:47.800 --> 37:48.869
<i>This is his wife.</i>

37:53.440 --> 37:55.908
<i>And even somebody</i>
<i>as totally approving as he is...</i>

38:00.720 --> 38:02.119
<i>The mood swings are up.</i>

38:02.200 --> 38:04.156
Deb, cheer up!

38:06.520 --> 38:08.636
What am I going to do about me?

38:11.880 --> 38:13.916
No, not yet!

38:17.360 --> 38:18.634
Great sex.

38:29.320 --> 38:31.231
<i>I remember early in conversation...</i>

38:31.320 --> 38:34.357
<i>we had worried about taking him</i>
<i>from a sex scene with his wife...</i>

38:34.440 --> 38:38.877
<i>to seeing Paz, as he will here, which we've...</i>

38:40.160 --> 38:44.836
<i>I hope successfully, played in a way</i>
<i>that it's innocent and respectful...</i>

38:44.920 --> 38:47.832
<i>but it does start the story rolling even more.</i>

38:48.320 --> 38:51.630
<i>And it was so much the crux. Just what</i>
<i>you say when you say, you know...</i>

38:51.720 --> 38:54.473
<i>We did obsess over this.</i>
<i>We didn't give the wrong impression.</i>

38:54.560 --> 38:57.393
<i>We didn't wanna say it was an excuse</i>
<i>to get hot over the maid.</i>

38:57.480 --> 38:59.948
<i>People laid that on us all the time.</i>

39:00.320 --> 39:02.550
<i>These are two innocents...</i>

39:02.640 --> 39:06.679
<i>who feel a kinship that is not romantic at all</i>
<i>at this point.</i>

39:09.120 --> 39:11.680
<i>Also, in many of the scenes...</i>

39:11.760 --> 39:14.718
<i>you walk on a certain,</i>
<i>almost an edge of a razorblade...</i>

39:14.800 --> 39:18.554
<i>because if you linger on Paz's looks,</i>
<i>too long...</i>

39:18.640 --> 39:20.631
<i>it becomes a romantic scene.</i>

39:24.200 --> 39:25.474
Be happy.

39:26.720 --> 39:27.914
Be happy.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.831
Yeah. Absolutely.

39:33.680 --> 39:37.958
<i>It's a tricky question, you know.</i>
<i>And I guess it is a touchy subject...</i>

39:38.040 --> 39:41.715
<i>if you're married</i>
<i>and you're committed to one individual.</i>

39:41.800 --> 39:44.917
<i>But does that close you off</i>
<i>to any kind of real human contact...</i>

39:45.000 --> 39:46.718
<i>with somebody of the opposite sex forever?</i>

39:46.800 --> 39:48.472
<i>Are you allowed to have things in common?</i>

39:48.560 --> 39:51.757
<i>Are you allowed to get close at all,</i>
<i>even if you don't go too far?</i>

39:52.040 --> 39:54.713
<i>I think Richie and I have to say,</i>
<i>"No comment."</i>

39:55.240 --> 39:59.552
<i>And not about each other. I mean,</i>
<i>this is not a racy cutting room.</i>

40:00.800 --> 40:04.998
<i>But I think that's part of the sensitivity</i>
<i>that's at play here.</i>

40:06.240 --> 40:08.913
<i>Falling in love with one person</i>
<i>and marrying one person...</i>

40:09.000 --> 40:12.037
<i>doesn't necessarily cut you off</i>
<i>from respecting...</i>

40:13.160 --> 40:14.718
<i>connections with other people.</i>

40:14.800 --> 40:17.268
<i>Or being attracted to other people...</i>

40:19.520 --> 40:20.839
<i>in some way.</i>

40:21.160 --> 40:25.915
<i>Yeah. The friendship carries danger.</i>
<i>But here, you couldn't have...</i>

40:27.360 --> 40:29.794
<i>more scrupulously honourable people.</i>

40:31.040 --> 40:33.918
I had to, right then,
or I would have lost him.

40:34.520 --> 40:38.069
<i>But we were aware</i>
<i>that we were walking that line...</i>

40:38.160 --> 40:40.151
<i>and that's why we had 13 previews...</i>

40:40.240 --> 40:43.357
<i>to make sure of our communication</i>
<i>with the audience.</i>

40:45.000 --> 40:46.433
I don't exist.

40:47.120 --> 40:49.031
<i>There was a moment in the writing of this...</i>

40:49.120 --> 40:51.475
<i>where I couldn't imagine</i>
<i>this picture happening...</i>

40:51.560 --> 40:54.757
<i>unless there was one night of lovemaking...</i>

40:56.800 --> 40:58.631
<i>between Flor and John.</i>

40:58.720 --> 40:59.520
<i>And then doing the picture</i>
<i>primarily sequentially...</i>

40:59.520 --> 41:01.556
<i>And then doing the picture</i>
<i>primarily sequentially...</i>

41:01.640 --> 41:04.234
<i>it became absolutely unthinkable</i>
<i>that that would happen.</i>

41:04.320 --> 41:05.799
<i>It's the biggest shift I ever had...</i>

41:05.880 --> 41:09.270
<i>between thinking of something in the script</i>
<i>and doing the movie.</i>

41:14.600 --> 41:16.238
- Hi.
- Hi there.

41:18.560 --> 41:23.270
<i>This was always, "How do you show an</i>
<i>affair most briefly and most..."</i>

41:25.280 --> 41:26.395
- Okay.
- Good.

41:27.320 --> 41:30.517
<i>I think it's great that it's exactly that.</i>

41:30.600 --> 41:33.114
<i>It's just this dynamic that happens...</i>

41:34.120 --> 41:37.271
<i>in the briefest of moment</i>
<i>between these two people.</i>

41:39.440 --> 41:42.273
I'm never gonna be one of those girls
whose hair...

41:43.760 --> 41:48.276
<i>Right. Woman at the end of her rope,</i>
<i>needing something from a man.</i>

41:49.240 --> 41:53.074
<i>And, like, the most base thing.</i>
<i>A man who makes her feel beautiful.</i>

41:54.520 --> 41:58.752
<i>- Instead of a mess.</i>
<i>- By putting a window up, you know.</i>

42:07.040 --> 42:08.678
You must be trouble.

42:12.280 --> 42:16.558
<i>If you cut to him... We had a cut to him</i>
<i>after that, then it became smarmy.</i>

42:16.640 --> 42:18.551
<i>Yeah. Because of that one cut.</i>

42:18.640 --> 42:20.756
<i>It was lascivious, the cut.</i>

42:20.840 --> 42:22.478
Isn't it gorgeous?

42:26.080 --> 42:29.709
It's beautiful. It's fabulous. Perfect.

42:30.360 --> 42:32.749
What word is the same in Spanish?

42:34.480 --> 42:35.754
Thank you.

42:37.080 --> 42:39.275
So, this will be your room, okay?

42:39.840 --> 42:42.877
Don't worry.
I'm gonna put lots of nice stuff in here, too.

42:42.960 --> 42:44.791
<i>Ida Random, the production designer...</i>

42:44.880 --> 42:48.634
<i>and Leslie Pope,</i>
<i>who did all the interior design...</i>

42:50.120 --> 42:51.997
<i>they had to represent...</i>

42:52.080 --> 42:55.789
<i>somebody who was brilliant</i>
<i>at casually decorating...</i>

42:56.120 --> 42:59.510
<i>that didn't just do "rich person's house,"</i>
<i>that didn't have a decorator.</i>

42:59.600 --> 43:03.195
<i>Deborah knew how to do this. She'd</i>
<i>fix up the room a little, do little touches.</i>

43:03.280 --> 43:05.032
<i>She was eclectic. She picked up things.</i>

43:05.120 --> 43:07.714
<i>This was true in her main house.</i>
<i>It was true in this house.</i>

43:07.800 --> 43:11.429
<i>This I always wanted to do,</i>
<i>the Malibu you don't see, where it's...</i>

43:12.280 --> 43:15.238
<i>There's this blood spill right outside</i>
<i>your perfect door...</i>

43:15.320 --> 43:18.198
<i>because Pacific Coast Hwy.</i>
<i>Is one of the most dangerous streets.</i>

43:18.720 --> 43:19.994
Excuse me.

43:23.360 --> 43:26.750
- Excuse me, do you speak English?
- Yes, I do.

43:26.840 --> 43:30.116
Would you please help me?
Will you translate for me with her?

43:32.440 --> 43:36.479
<i>Okay. I heard a rumour about this</i>
<i>wonderful character actor we're seeing now.</i>

43:36.560 --> 43:40.155
<i>I'm not going to find out whether it's true.</i>
<i>This is alleged.</i>

43:41.960 --> 43:44.474
<i>I heard just six weeks ago...</i>

43:45.440 --> 43:48.000
<i>that he doesn't speak Spanish.</i>

43:51.200 --> 43:52.428
<i>That he had conned me.</i>

43:52.520 --> 43:55.830
<i>And it's so great if it's true now,</i>
<i>because it means he learned enough...</i>

43:55.920 --> 43:59.595
<i>to convince me, because I would've never</i>
<i>hired somebody who didn't speak Spanish.</i>

43:59.680 --> 44:02.194
<i>So it's, either way, hats off.</i>

44:05.800 --> 44:07.518
You have a daughter?

44:08.240 --> 44:10.879
A whole daughter you've never mentioned?

44:11.280 --> 44:13.919
This is a little crazy that I don't know this.

44:14.040 --> 44:15.439
<i>The great thing about this scene...</i>

44:15.520 --> 44:19.274
<i>is not only are we learning that</i>
<i>Deborah didn't know she had a daughter...</i>

44:19.360 --> 44:23.239
<i>we, again, are showing</i>
<i>that men look at Flor...</i>

44:23.320 --> 44:25.914
<i>and start to drool. They go gaga.</i>

44:26.000 --> 44:28.514
<i>They just think that she's something...</i>

44:28.800 --> 44:31.951
<i>and yet, that conversation</i>
<i>of glossing over it...</i>

44:32.040 --> 44:34.235
<i>because Deborah's okay with it...</i>

44:34.840 --> 44:38.389
<i>but there's this kind of ticking time bomb</i>
<i>in the household.</i>

44:39.360 --> 44:42.238
<i>In the backstory</i>
<i>that we didn't put in the picture...</i>

44:42.320 --> 44:46.279
<i>her husband had gone back to crime</i>
<i>without telling her...</i>

44:46.360 --> 44:49.670
<i>and his crime was</i>
<i>producing knockoffs of luxury items.</i>

44:52.200 --> 44:55.636
<i>She found out when he was arrested</i>
<i>and taken away for 25 years.</i>

44:55.760 --> 44:57.910
<i>And there was one of his associates...</i>

44:58.000 --> 45:00.639
<i>who flew them into the country</i>
<i>in a small private plane.</i>

45:00.720 --> 45:02.915
<i>And there was always a line I hated losing:</i>

45:03.000 --> 45:06.276
<i>"She would no longer be drawn</i>
<i>to men with rough edges...</i>

45:06.360 --> 45:07.998
<i>"goodness would be her catnip."</i>

45:08.080 --> 45:11.470
<i>It was a narrator's line I hated to lose,</i>
<i>because it so much...</i>

45:11.560 --> 45:14.552
<i>set her up for what the connection was</i>
<i>with John.</i>

45:19.680 --> 45:23.798
<i>And here we just worked so hard</i>
<i>and I don't think I ever got it great.</i>

45:24.240 --> 45:27.073
<i>But the idea of it was so enormous...</i>

45:28.080 --> 45:30.913
<i>that you're just thrown</i>
<i>into a casual decision.</i>

45:31.000 --> 45:33.309
<i>I need you to sleep in.</i>
<i>You're gonna sleep in or not?</i>

45:33.400 --> 45:34.674
<i>I need somebody to do that.</i>

45:34.760 --> 45:38.548
<i>And you're gonna create the rest of your life</i>
<i>with your decision.</i>

45:43.320 --> 45:47.199
<i>That's the truth and</i>
<i>that's the ruling class-underclass kind of...</i>

45:47.280 --> 45:48.713
<i>gritty truth...</i>

45:49.880 --> 45:53.429
<i>that, I think, neither class</i>
<i>can fully come to terms with...</i>

45:54.480 --> 45:56.710
<i>because it's just such a big deal.</i>

45:56.800 --> 46:00.156
<i>How do you live when every decision</i>
<i>controls your life?</i>

46:03.000 --> 46:07.198
The first time one sees natural beauty
which is privately owned...

46:07.680 --> 46:11.514
oceans as people's backyards
confounds the senses.

46:11.600 --> 46:12.953
Oh, my gosh.

46:13.040 --> 46:15.713
I didn't know God had a toy store
for the rich.

46:15.800 --> 46:18.268
The beaches are so clean. It's beautiful.

46:18.360 --> 46:21.909
<i>I just wanna call attention</i>
<i>to the voice of the narrator, Aimee Garcia...</i>

46:22.000 --> 46:26.710
<i>'cause not only is she a kid</i>
<i>who comes from the background...</i>

46:26.800 --> 46:28.358
<i>of the narrator...</i>

46:28.680 --> 46:31.353
<i>but her spirit just...</i>

46:31.440 --> 46:35.513
<i>We were changing the narration</i>
<i>all the time, as we changed the picture.</i>

46:35.600 --> 46:39.559
<i>So she would be in the cutting rooms</i>
<i>endlessly, and unflagging.</i>

46:40.000 --> 46:41.592
You want to go swimming?

46:41.680 --> 46:43.511
<i>I think she camped out in a corner.</i>

46:43.600 --> 46:47.036
<i>She'd work out on the stairs.</i>
<i>Go up and down. You ever see her do that?</i>

46:47.120 --> 46:48.792
<i>When we were just...</i>

46:51.200 --> 46:52.349
<i>sodden.</i>

46:53.920 --> 46:57.435
Oh, God, you could make a fortune
at surrogate pregnancy.

46:59.400 --> 47:00.992
How you doing? I'm John.

47:01.080 --> 47:02.479
- Hello.
- Great.

47:02.640 --> 47:04.631
Come on out and meet everybody.

47:04.760 --> 47:07.274
<i>This is also a tricky scene because...</i>

47:07.560 --> 47:11.678
<i>there are so many different characters you</i>
<i>can have the camera on at different points...</i>

47:11.760 --> 47:14.149
<i>to read what's happening, and it was...</i>

47:14.480 --> 47:16.471
<i>This was a tough one, yeah.</i>

47:16.560 --> 47:19.393
No comparisons, please.

47:19.960 --> 47:22.633
I'm not even gonna respond to that.
Come here.

47:25.600 --> 47:29.798
My mum says it's best if we go, get
out of your way, and put our things away.

47:29.920 --> 47:31.831
Yes, go get settled.

47:34.560 --> 47:38.553
<i>I think Shay Cunliffe, the costumer,</i>
<i>just did such a great, understated job.</i>

47:38.640 --> 47:40.153
<i>I could always count on her...</i>

47:40.240 --> 47:43.630
<i>for having put so much time into everything</i>
<i>that it was accurate.</i>

47:43.720 --> 47:47.554
<i>The idea was to make them specific</i>
<i>and not call particular attention to it.</i>

47:47.640 --> 47:51.918
I need to make a serving platter
for serving fish out of sea glass like this.

47:52.240 --> 47:55.437
<i>It was weird. Having looked for sea glass</i>
<i>a lot of my life...</i>

47:55.560 --> 47:58.358
<i>and just find a piece every once in a while...</i>

48:00.000 --> 48:03.629
<i>and always envying collections,</i>
<i>that suddenly you tell a prop man...</i>

48:03.720 --> 48:06.075
<i>there's a scene with sea glass</i>
<i>and you get a bucket...</i>

48:06.160 --> 48:08.594
<i>that you could've spent four lifetimes</i>
<i>and not...</i>

48:10.080 --> 48:14.392
All right, $5 for any piece
that isn't brown, clear, or green.

48:15.680 --> 48:17.910
<i>Her seeing her mother do the work...</i>

48:18.000 --> 48:21.151
<i>the minute we saw it, it always had</i>
<i>such an extraordinary impact...</i>

48:21.240 --> 48:24.516
<i>her seeing that. That brief, and it just...</i>

48:25.160 --> 48:28.072
<i>When we first cut it in like that,</i>
<i>it was just a stunner.</i>

48:28.160 --> 48:30.515
<i>The first moment of this child</i>
<i>actually feeling...</i>

48:30.600 --> 48:33.068
<i>maybe some embarrassment</i>
<i>at what her mother does...</i>

48:33.160 --> 48:35.469
<i>in comparison to the other family.</i>

48:35.800 --> 48:38.234
Oh, my God, Georgie.

48:44.640 --> 48:46.949
<i>The lesson that you never learn enough...</i>

48:47.040 --> 48:50.430
<i>is how thoroughly</i>
<i>every member of an audience...</i>

48:50.600 --> 48:53.194
<i>understands every moment of a film...</i>

48:53.280 --> 48:56.238
<i>and just what was going on</i>
<i>here in this section.</i>

48:58.480 --> 49:00.914
<i>They were laughing so early in it...</i>

49:01.880 --> 49:03.871
<i>in terms of the kid just...</i>

49:04.680 --> 49:07.672
<i>obsessing over getting the stones</i>
<i>for the money.</i>

49:08.160 --> 49:11.391
<i>Here's something that always impresses me.</i>
<i>That's a fake rock.</i>

49:12.040 --> 49:13.951
<i>- Weighs a pound.</i>
<i>- Doesn't impress me so much.</i>

49:16.560 --> 49:20.633
<i>Okay, it's not</i> Matrix, <i>but it's still</i>
<i>an interesting... Still something, isn't it?</i>

49:20.720 --> 49:24.156
<i>I mean, we just put a rock there</i>
<i>that wasn't a real rock.</i>

49:37.480 --> 49:41.393
<i>See, this is that fixed-up room,</i>
<i>the few little Deborah touches.</i>

49:45.760 --> 49:47.193
What's wrong?

49:48.600 --> 49:51.114
<i>Cloris is making sangria, I love that.</i>

49:52.400 --> 49:54.277
Flor.

50:01.120 --> 50:02.394
I'm sorry.

50:03.200 --> 50:04.269
Very sorry.

50:04.360 --> 50:06.237
<i>It's sort of interesting because...</i>

50:06.320 --> 50:09.198
<i>basically, at this point, it's just so human.</i>

50:10.320 --> 50:14.393
<i>He's whitey. He's part of that family.</i>
<i>He's part of those people that...</i>

50:15.080 --> 50:17.389
<i>just grab her daughter and take it.</i>

50:20.120 --> 50:23.351
<i>It's his way of dealing with this.</i>
<i>She just wants this guy to get lost.</i>

50:23.440 --> 50:26.671
<i>She doesn't want anybody</i>
<i>to intrude on her privacy like this.</i>

50:26.760 --> 50:27.875
Thanks.

50:30.320 --> 50:34.552
<i>Now, up until this point in the movie,</i>
<i>she has watched from a distance...</i>

50:34.720 --> 50:37.871
<i>and noticed where they're all struggling.</i>

50:38.400 --> 50:42.473
<i>This is the first time she becomes</i>
<i>vulnerable and somebody else notices.</i>

50:42.560 --> 50:45.028
<i>It's that kind of turning point.</i>

50:48.600 --> 50:51.592
Simpático <i>does mean something different</i>
<i>to a Mexican...</i>

50:51.680 --> 50:52.954
<i>than it means to us.</i>

50:53.040 --> 50:56.476
<i>It doesn't mean "on the same wavelength,"</i>
<i>and she's just plain not.</i>

50:59.440 --> 51:02.079
I really am sorry that this is happening.

51:02.440 --> 51:04.112
<i>She doesn't want to hear any...</i>

51:04.200 --> 51:07.158
<i>She doesn't understand</i>
<i>what he's saying, anyway.</i>

51:10.560 --> 51:12.278
I didn't mean like...

51:14.440 --> 51:16.112
<i>And miscommunicates.</i>

51:19.800 --> 51:23.190
<i>I think it's the only thing</i>
<i>she fully understands in the whole scene.</i>

51:23.280 --> 51:25.919
<i>That he goofed up by touching his heart.</i>

51:31.240 --> 51:32.958
Thank you so much.

51:35.520 --> 51:38.193
<i>In the script it was</i>
<i>that she changes her hairdo...</i>

51:38.280 --> 51:41.158
<i>and then Téa came up with this idea</i>
<i>for the different colours...</i>

51:41.240 --> 51:44.038
<i>and it just was so great. It hit right away.</i>

51:45.280 --> 51:48.352
<i>Again, it's so amazing how so totally</i>
<i>every member of an audience...</i>

51:48.440 --> 51:50.556
<i>sees this as a violation,</i>
<i>instead of a fun thing.</i>

51:50.640 --> 51:53.598
<i>You'd think there'd be some people</i>
<i>who wouldn't.</i>

51:54.200 --> 51:57.237
<i>But we always got a reaction</i>
<i>of that first shot of Cristina...</i>

51:57.320 --> 51:58.514
<i>as soon as they saw the hair.</i>

51:58.600 --> 52:02.195
<i>I think it's because they understand Flor.</i>
<i>I think that has to be it.</i>

52:02.280 --> 52:04.271
I just think that you're...

52:05.120 --> 52:08.192
the most amazing white woman
that I've ever met.

52:08.480 --> 52:12.792
<i>I've always seen this as the first</i>
<i>real romantic scene in the movie...</i>

52:13.320 --> 52:17.108
<i>where this girl just idolises this woman.</i>

52:18.920 --> 52:22.879
Absurd, but deeply appreciated, Cristina.

52:30.040 --> 52:32.759
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you so much. That was so fun.

52:32.840 --> 52:35.354
<i>Well, that's America: Beautiful, generous.</i>

52:37.760 --> 52:39.671
Did something bad happen?

52:41.920 --> 52:45.071
Cristina, tell your mother those wash
right out. It's no big deal.

52:45.160 --> 52:46.559
Not right now.

52:50.640 --> 52:51.868
What?

52:52.800 --> 52:56.270
You can't just take someone else's kid
and then make them over.

52:56.360 --> 52:59.830
Don't go there. Or I'll go there,
and you know where "there" is.

53:01.240 --> 53:03.595
<i>My favourite response in the movie.</i>

53:05.760 --> 53:09.435
<i>Because what the charge is,</i>
<i>your promiscuous, alcoholic past.</i>

53:10.240 --> 53:12.549
<i>And the only proper answer is...</i>

53:17.760 --> 53:21.389
<i>Just keeps on shifting. Mother, daughter.</i>
<i>Different mother to daughter.</i>

53:30.680 --> 53:32.477
- What's this?
- For you.

53:33.320 --> 53:34.435
From?

53:35.360 --> 53:37.430
Look, you are not yourself.

53:37.520 --> 53:40.796
This was written in anger. Will you hold on?

53:40.880 --> 53:43.348
Sleep on it.
You still want me to have it, that's fine.

53:44.040 --> 53:47.669
<i>It's so great that she can't deal with herself.</i>

53:48.120 --> 53:51.510
<i>This is what she does to her own bad voices</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

53:55.000 --> 53:58.913
<i>Nobody can do this alive.</i>
<i>No actress alive can do this but Téa Leoni.</i>

53:59.000 --> 54:01.753
<i>This was an amazing day of dailies to watch.</i>

54:02.480 --> 54:03.629
Insensitive?

54:04.160 --> 54:08.039
<i>It takes extraordinary strength,</i>
<i>and I'm given to more than a few takes.</i>

54:08.960 --> 54:10.075
Stupid.

54:11.040 --> 54:15.238
<i>I think there was a take where there were</i>
<i>two cameras, one on Adam and one on her.</i>

54:16.320 --> 54:20.199
<i>You had Adam keep reading one of</i>
<i>the lines, and she was stuck in that pose...</i>

54:20.280 --> 54:22.475
<i>and finally she said, "Enough!"</i>

54:24.320 --> 54:27.756
<i>That's why they look at me funny</i>
<i>at the end of the day.</i>

54:29.440 --> 54:31.271
Get on board, pal.

54:33.600 --> 54:34.749
I slept.

54:47.800 --> 54:50.075
<i>There are scenes that you pray work well.</i>

54:50.160 --> 54:53.311
<i>This scene always</i>
<i>worked beyond my imagination.</i>

54:55.160 --> 54:58.391
No, please. Don't worry about it.
You really don't have to pay me.

54:58.480 --> 55:01.119
- Please, don't worry about it.
- I'm just kidding.

55:03.920 --> 55:07.196
- When you count it up, give me a holler.
- I did count.

55:07.520 --> 55:11.035
Many times. I didn't sleep. I counted.

55:11.120 --> 55:13.918
All right, what do I owe you? Give it to me.

55:15.360 --> 55:16.759
$640.

55:17.920 --> 55:20.673
<i>The hardest figure to come up with...</i>

55:21.280 --> 55:23.714
<i>I think it was written as</i>
<i>1,200-and-something...</i>

55:23.800 --> 55:27.713
<i>which was preposterous, and 300,</i>
<i>just trying to figure out that number.</i>

55:27.800 --> 55:30.678
How about
we figure this out tomorrow, okay?

55:30.760 --> 55:33.593
You even told me, you said that $5...

55:33.920 --> 55:35.990
I know, I promised.

55:37.760 --> 55:41.514
It's all coming back to me now.
Let me just go deal with this.

55:53.600 --> 55:56.751
<i>I guess there was no scene</i>
<i>I worried more about...</i>

55:56.840 --> 55:58.193
<i>than the one coming up.</i>

55:58.280 --> 56:01.556
<i>And there was never a time</i>
<i>where I didn't think...</i>

56:01.640 --> 56:03.710
<i>it was basically the picture.</i>

56:04.160 --> 56:07.835
<i>That everything leads to this scene</i>
<i>and stems from this scene.</i>

56:22.560 --> 56:26.189
<i>I think it's the longest scene I ever did,</i>
<i>the one coming up.</i>

56:36.240 --> 56:38.071
Cristina?

56:43.360 --> 56:46.352
<i>Okay. Greatest sandwich ever.</i>
<i>Thomas Keller sandwich.</i>

56:46.440 --> 56:49.830
<i>Nobody ever miss. This is the</i>
<i>greatest sandwich in film history.</i>

56:49.920 --> 56:53.037
<i>I take no credit for it.</i>
<i>Mr. Keller was on the set.</i>

56:53.200 --> 56:57.113
<i>The ooze is perfect.</i>
<i>It has to be cooked just right for that ooze.</i>

56:57.440 --> 57:00.352
<i>You have that with a beer</i>
<i>and a sports section...</i>

57:00.440 --> 57:02.158
<i>and that pour is important, too...</i>

57:02.240 --> 57:04.913
<i>and you are living right at that moment.</i>

57:06.880 --> 57:09.474
<i>I have to say</i>
<i>that at this point in every screening...</i>

57:09.560 --> 57:13.155
<i>I wanted that beer and sandwich so badly.</i>
<i>We're about an hour in?</i>

57:13.240 --> 57:16.676
<i>We would be screening at nights,</i>
<i>hadn't had dinner.</i>

57:16.960 --> 57:18.552
<i>How long is this scene, Rich?</i>

57:18.640 --> 57:22.918
<i>This is about seven minutes</i>
<i>from beginning to end.</i>

57:25.600 --> 57:27.830
Yeah. Sure.

57:30.880 --> 57:32.552
You can talk to me.

57:34.800 --> 57:36.791
I don't have to sleep first?

57:42.240 --> 57:44.470
What's wrong? Come on, sit down.

57:47.080 --> 57:48.354
I'm sorry.

57:49.280 --> 57:51.635
Did you give this money to my daughter?

57:51.720 --> 57:55.190
I made a deal with the kids. All the kids.

57:56.400 --> 57:57.674
Oh, no! Please.

57:59.880 --> 58:03.589
You don't tell or ask the mother
when you give a child a fortune...

58:03.920 --> 58:07.196
for looking on the beach for stones?

58:08.920 --> 58:11.434
- What is the word for this?
- Sea glass.

58:15.600 --> 58:17.431
No, not a name for the stones.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.468
A name for the action, what you did.

58:25.560 --> 58:30.315
<i>I always thought that it was so dangerous</i>
<i>whenever they were in one spot...</i>

58:31.040 --> 58:34.316
<i>because of the Spanish</i>
<i>happening at the same time.</i>

58:34.400 --> 58:36.038
I had no idea.

58:36.120 --> 58:38.918
<i>Watching now, I'd say I should</i>
<i>have moved him even sooner.</i>

58:39.000 --> 58:40.752
<i>But they do keep moving.</i>

58:48.560 --> 58:50.596
But $50 is a lot of money.

58:52.600 --> 58:55.433
<i>As much as you're watching the dynamic</i>
<i>between John and Flor...</i>

58:55.520 --> 58:58.910
<i>you can't take your eyes off Shelbie,</i>
<i>'cause she's doing such a great job...</i>

58:59.000 --> 59:01.116
<i>of being both of them.</i>

59:01.400 --> 59:02.753
<i>Yeah, that was her audition scene.</i>

59:02.840 --> 59:07.391
<i>And she's 11 years old,</i>
<i>a wonderful, sheltered child...</i>

59:09.160 --> 59:12.630
<i>in life, so it's just sheer talent.</i>

59:17.480 --> 59:21.598
I know what it's like
when you feel your kid's being messed with.

59:26.760 --> 59:27.954
It won't happen again.

59:28.040 --> 59:31.271
<i>And still not a thought,</i>
<i>there's no thought of romance here.</i>

59:32.320 --> 59:36.199
<i>It's just, some anger is going to</i>
<i>get them to the next plateau.</i>

59:39.280 --> 59:43.319
<i>She's been living with her anger,</i>
<i>he hasn't been living with his anger at all.</i>

59:43.400 --> 59:44.992
You guys get some sleep.

59:47.240 --> 59:48.639
Sleep?

59:49.480 --> 59:50.674
No.

59:53.840 --> 59:56.035
<i>We didn't cut</i>
<i>much content out of this scene, did we?</i>

59:56.120 --> 01:00:00.830
<i>Very little. This really is complete script,</i>
<i>this scene.</i>

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.679
...I need to say, no matter what the result...

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:06.791
I need to be impolite.

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:13.555
<i>The fear was always that</i>
<i>because we were having the Spanish...</i>

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.552
<i>and then the girl translating into English...</i>

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.791
<i>that the scene was going to play</i>
<i>so incredibly long...</i>

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.190
<i>but it doesn't,</i>
<i>it has an incredible dynamic to it.</i>

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.115
Your wife takes her for little tours.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.910
And she changes her hair.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.118
And you give her money.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.069
Here, take back the money.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.874
<i>There's such a weird thing</i>
<i>that I like in this scene...</i>

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.349
<i>because he is carrying around</i>
<i>a piece of information...</i>

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.590
<i>that you also have,</i>
<i>but it occurs to nobody...</i>

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.558
<i>that information</i>
<i>is going to come into play soon.</i>

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.359
<i>It's just a small thing, but it's...</i>

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:09.513
I didn't really mean to be angry to you.
Only emotional, for me.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.350
What about hypocritical?

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:23.670
Yes, you heard me!
It's not like you didn't do the same thing.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.273
Yes, you did.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.558
So why don't you go lecture yourself?
You won't need a translator for that one.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.550
What am I lately, a recycling bin?

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.189
Anybody dump in your garbage
and hope I make something useful out of it?

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.198
Yes, you did the same thing.

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:44.074
You think I don't know
about you altering those outfits for Bernie?

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.912
She tells me her stuff.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.628
So am I missing something?

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:52.269
<i>This is so key, all our prejudice</i>
<i>says there is a difference.</i>

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.193
<i>She is the wonderful</i>
<i>second-world housekeeper...</i>

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.350
<i>and he's the rich American.</i>

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.710
There's no difference. I interfered.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.230
<i>A woman who owns her behaviour.</i>

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.119
You're kidding me?

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.393
<i>Again, no comment.</i>

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:20.639
...concede the point.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.031
I'm dazed here.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.755
<i>Also one bond which the audience</i>
<i>completely relates to.</i>

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:38.036
<i>And this is the first time we allow</i>
<i>any romance to be played, with the music.</i>

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.152
And you were very right.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:48.228
<i>And this becomes, in all innocence,</i>
<i>an intimate conversation.</i>

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:54.437
<i>And you could talk a long time about</i>
<i>how afraid people were...</i>

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.398
<i>to mention, in advance,</i>
<i>this part of the relationship.</i>

01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.994
<i>And people should talk a long time about it.</i>

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:05.117
But how can I keep working for you
after we talked like this?

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.395
<i>'Cause now they're on different ground.</i>

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.950
Even if you wanted to. And you know why.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:18.597
<i>And for the first time it occurs to her,</i>
<i>"Is he coming on to me?"</i>

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:21.839
You know.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.475
Why?

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:26.879
<i>My favourite reading of the movie.</i>

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:30.714
If you do, Cristina will blame herself
for costing you the job.

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.829
And that guilt...

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:39.195
<i>And she was wrong,</i>
<i>it's right back to her kid.</i>

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.111
I don't know if you know about guilt.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.917
<i>It's a very specific, weird intimacy</i>
<i>they're having right now.</i>

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.231
<i>He's right into her head</i>
<i>about her issues as a parent.</i>

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:57.590
<i>And yet it's all being translated through</i>
<i>the third party, which is amazing.</i>

01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:59.830
<i>I think that was a point</i>
<i>where we were getting...</i>

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.639
<i>such great response to Shelbie...</i>

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:05.632
<i>that we put more of Cristina</i>
<i>into that moment...</i>

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:09.919
<i>and realised that it killed the intimacy,</i>
<i>and we took it right out.</i>

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.752
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:19.039
You can't be translating for me all the time.
I need to learn English now.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:24.439
I really wasn't supposed to translate that.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:27.711
Listen to your mother. She knows it all.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.674
Learning English would cost...

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.274
<i>This is the actual tapes they send out.</i>

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.112
12 monthly payments of $86.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.031
<i>This was a tough montage.</i>

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:47.957
22% interest.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.795
Assimilation gets expensive.

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.190
<i>The fascinating thing about these tapes...</i>

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.953
<i>is it's not only just repeating back words...</i>

01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:01.396
<i>it's repeating back sentences,</i>
<i>and sometimes it's jokes...</i>

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:05.439
<i>party jokes and things, and so I think</i>
<i>we played with a lot of different things...</i>

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:07.988
<i>that she could be saying.</i>

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:14.153
<i>This dog, Mikey,</i>
<i>we used two different dogs...</i>

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:16.071
<i>but coming up, you're going to see...</i>

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.357
<i>Mikey do a human expression</i>
<i>of perplexity...</i>

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:22.991
<i>that dogs don't do, the breed doesn't do.</i>

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:27.437
<i>This specific dog does. And I'm going to try</i>
<i>and show it to you, there!</i>

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.191
<i>See the wrinkled brow?</i>

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.112
<i>That's Mikey's ad-lib joke.</i>

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.398
<i>This is the moment I was referring to.</i>

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.790
<i>We did that the last minute,</i>
<i>doing her in front of the television set.</i>

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:49.429
<i>Told Cloris to go in there,</i>
<i>and that became the heart of it.</i>

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:52.871
Have you any particular one in mind?

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:56.117
I really enjoyed the <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy...

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.191
by Mr. George Lucas.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:03.439
<i>I always worry about montage. I think</i>
<i>you have to be French to do them right.</i>

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.714
Sorry.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:10.110
Should we stop answering the phone?
We're booked for four months solid.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.349
No.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:15.235
I want to keep some walk-in business.
I want this to stay neighbourhood.

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:19.074
- The trick is stay the same.
- Impossible, John. There'd be riots.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.799
You should hear the desperation
in their voices.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:23.711
<i>Coming up he says something so weird.</i>

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:26.439
<i>Nobody ever comments</i>
<i>that he says something so weird.</i>

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:29.637
<i>Sort of neat, you know,</i>
<i>"What does he mean?"</i>

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.992
We'll serve the full menu at the bar.

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.399
<i>That's not it.</i>

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.918
- Do this for me.
- There's no way.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.149
<i>This is it.</i>

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:43.279
Do this for me or I'll set my hair on fire
and start punching myself in the face!

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.078
Yeah, you're right.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.833
That was an unusual way
for me to make myself understood.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:52.355
<i>You sort of hope?</i>
<i>We've all had that feeling, right?</i>

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.149
<i>- No? With family?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.036
<i>We went back and got this little piece...</i>

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:06.351
<i>just to give us a transition</i>
<i>into his drunk scene.</i>

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.749
<i>Because without it,</i>
<i>it was just too crazy a leap...</i>

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:12.196
<i>and I was very grateful</i>
<i>I was able to get this little piece.</i>

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:15.550
<i>The concept of a chef,</i>
<i>he doesn't just get drunk...</i>

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.915
<i>he gets drunk with Brie and pears.</i>

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.389
<i>We had a whole bunch of dialogue</i>
<i>that I had to lose.</i>

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:24.996
<i>He said that if you drank in a cooler</i>
<i>at 52 degrees...</i>

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:27.992
<i>you didn't get as drunk.</i>

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.229
Okay, thanks.

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.352
Great. Thank you.

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.116
Thank you for the ride home...

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.668
but it was not necessary.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:55.391
All right, yes.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:59.551
Four stars
and I've never been more unhappy.

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:04.029
<i>You know, when you think of it, guys...</i>

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:08.515
<i>it could be a simpler scene,</i>
<i>but because we were so...</i>

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:13.952
<i>concerned with character and what could</i>
<i>happen, what we went through on this...</i>

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.918
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.830
<i>I think it went through each cutting room</i>
<i>a couple of times, right?</i>

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.035
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.953
I don't know what to wear to the party.

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:36.314
I'm wearing jeans.

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.390
<i>My favourite line in the movie.</i>

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.313
<i>No offence.</i>

01:08:43.359 --> 01:08:46.158
<i>Well, you know, I played around</i>
<i>with a few others there.</i>

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:51.395
<i>It felt good when I nailed it.</i>

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.200
What are you wearing to the party?

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:23.551
Who's always there for you
at 2:30 in the morning?

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:37.475
<i>It was just, he is a kind of great guy where,</i>
<i>if life isn't simple and true...</i>

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:41.439
<i>he's in over his head, and I think</i>
<i>that's what's so touching about him.</i>

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.591
Don't you sleep anymore?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.197
<i>You always called him Dagwood Bumstead,</i>
<i>which I think fit.</i>

01:09:48.279 --> 01:09:51.795
<i>Yeah, who was a great</i>
<i>unrecognised American hero.</i>

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:53.393
<i>Exactly.</i>

01:09:53.479 --> 01:09:54.515
- No.
- Yes.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.830
Now I am like a 2-year-old.

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:00.869
I finish.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:05.351
No, keep going. No, not until you finish it.

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:10.797
<i>How close his face got, where he stood,</i>
<i>everything drove us crazy on this.</i>

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.597
- Did she say where?
- No.

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:17.875
<i>There's such a fine line between...</i>

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.394
<i>showing romance</i>
<i>and making people uncomfortable...</i>

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:23.233
<i>because he is a married man,</i>
<i>and this is their home.</i>

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.072
<i>- Easy, easy!</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:29.315
<i>I know, but that's what we used to say</i>
<i>to each other in the cutting room.</i>

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:33.029
<i>And you couldn't just do a nice romantic</i>
<i>comedy scene after somebody said that.</i>

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.872
<i>It was absolutely valid.</i>

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.789
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>we worried a lot in this scene...</i>

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:41.156
<i>that he was getting predatory.</i>

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:45.315
<i>And I don't think that was ever true.</i>

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:48.710
<i>I don't think where he's come from</i>
<i>in the film getting to here...</i>

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.712
<i>that we could ever perceive of him</i>
<i>as being predatory.</i>

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.116
I meant to say...

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:58.113
<i>- And he's so unaware himself, until...</i>
<i>- That's the innocence of it.</i>

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:02.673
<i>We had this shot out for a second.</i>
<i>That was preposterous to have this out.</i>

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:05.915
Don't be sensitive.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:09.558
Don't be wonderful.

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:12.953
<i>We made one change.</i>
<i>He used to say, "Don't be beautiful."</i>

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:15.873
<i>And we took that out</i>
<i>and left the "wonderful" in.</i>

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.631
I meant to say, "Hi, Flor."

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:20.912
Good night, Flor.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.560
That show you're watching
is gonna be a hit.

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.278
<i>I love that line, too.</i>

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.636
<i>I love his look up the stairs...</i>

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:37.393
<i>I love that we know everything</i>
<i>he's thinking at that moment.</i>

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:40.836
<i>I know that somebody who's just</i>
<i>that regular guy on the outside...</i>

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:43.798
<i>that we're seeing stirrings</i>
<i>that he isn't aware of.</i>

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.434
<i>And, of course, there's the old expression.</i>

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:55.112
Man, you do love me. I was wondering.

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:02.117
What about the point I'm making?
It's good, right?

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:04.595
Cristina has already read, on her own...

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:07.194
every book
on Bernice's summer reading list.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.918
And she's two grades behind her.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.958
Can you imagine
if she went to Bernice's school?

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:17.195
I think I could probably get her
a scholarship. God knows they owe me.

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:18.918
Talk to Flor.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.275
Yeah. She's so open to new things.

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:25.598
<i>Starting this scene on those shoes</i>
<i>just changes the entire dynamic.</i>

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:28.069
<i>Because it has nothing to do with</i>
<i>what she is saying...</i>

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:30.071
<i>and you're understanding</i>
<i>what she is saying...</i>

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:32.037
<i>but it all leads to this, which is so great.</i>

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:34.839
Anyway, I'm probably actually gonna be...

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.953
The cell will be bad,
so I'll just check in with you later.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.395
<i>It's so amazing,</i>
<i>whatever perspective you want to use...</i>

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:40.840
<i>if you want to do her affair...</i>

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:41.750
<i>if you want to do her affair...</i>

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.876
<i>but this way of just indicating her affair...</i>

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.916
<i>probably ends up being more truthful...</i>

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.798
<i>about what these things are,</i>
<i>than if you had gone into it.</i>

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.074
<i>Right.</i>

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.958
- Deborah.
- Arlene, what a surprise.

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:56.996
<i>That's a real educator, that woman there.</i>

01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.116
...the girl I am always raving to you about.

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.714
This is Arlene Folsom,
she's the School Director.

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:04.394
- Hi.
- Hello, a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Folsom.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.789
- Would you like a little tour?
- Really?

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:07.995
Great.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.156
She's gorgeous, isn't she?

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:14.793
Hispanic.

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.790
We ran into the head of the school
and Cristina knocked her out.

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:23.598
I had nothing to do with it.

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:26.319
<i>This scene,</i>
<i>there was just something wrong with.</i>

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.432
<i>I know, I think it's been in every version.</i>

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:35.991
<i>I know, I liked the kid behind the glass,</i>
<i>I didn't mind what they were saying.</i>

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.632
Fine, then don't.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.792
<i>It had to be in, because it was plot.</i>

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.757
The phrase is "no, thank you."

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:46.959
Mum was caught in a vise of manipulation.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.553
Please, dear God...

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:51.598
this is the most important prayer of my life.

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:54.797
It's about my education.
The health of my brain.

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:57.917
Please, dear God, enter my mother's heart.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.594
Make her understand
what this school means.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.116
<i>This is such a slight exaggeration...</i>

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:11.431
<i>the number of black SUVs</i>
<i>in the area we are talking about.</i>

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.351
<i>It really is slight.</i>

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.791
<i>We used to have a piece</i>
<i>we couldn't justify...</i>

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:23.078
<i>her going to the public school her daughter</i>
<i>attended just to show the difference...</i>

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:25.196
<i>but it was heavy-handed by my...</i>

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:43.117
- Hi, Flor.
- Hi.

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:45.470
Want some port?

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.392
No, thank you, Evelyn.

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.512
- How you doing?
- Hi.

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:51.957
<i>Casual drinking.</i>

01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:58.752
What? Okay.

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:03.875
<i>This is just, give him a kiss, and then they</i>
<i>play this, the two of them, and it's just dear.</i>

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:08.190
<i>That's great work. That little stumble,</i>
<i>you can't do better.</i>

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:10.429
Flor?

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.352
Thanks for never judging me.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:20.672
I love you. I love everybody.
That's what's killing me.

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.038
May I talk with you?

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.235
Me?

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.359
I just spoke to Deborah.

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:44.512
She'll be back soon
if you need to go over something.

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:47.194
I need to really talk. Is okay?

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:52.077
- No.
- No! Sure.

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.191
Sure. I'm sorry.

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.999
- Outside?
- Okay.

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:09.396
<i>You know, you can't... They're each</i>
<i>so committed to nothing happening.</i>

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:12.398
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- And something is happening.</i>

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:21.115
You have me a little nervous here.

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.953
<i>This was a very tough scene.</i>

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:26.555
Are we ever gonna stop? Just asking.

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:31.438
<i>Too romantic here we're dead,</i>
<i>and not have any...</i>

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.873
<i>you were just boring.</i>

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:37.350
You know about Cristina
and your private school?

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.713
Oh, that.

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:43.758
<i>But ultimately,</i>
<i>the discovery in this scene was that...</i>

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:45.992
<i>the romance...</i>

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:51.590
<i>came out of the concern that each had</i>
<i>about their children.</i>

01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:56.193
<i>And that, that was the driving force</i>
<i>in the beginning of the scene.</i>

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:59.432
...her school should let her know
how great she is, right?

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.876
<i>There was a moment we had to cut out</i>
<i>later on...</i>

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:04.918
<i>because it was length,</i>
<i>and we were so aware of that.</i>

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.514
<i>But where there was a moment</i>
<i>when she leaned back...</i>

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.433
<i>and they're both leaning back in the chairs</i>
<i>at the same time...</i>

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.272
<i>there was something wrong about it.</i>

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:16.114
<i>And it was so subtle,</i>
<i>and we were all so crazy about it.</i>

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.269
<i>Man.</i>

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:19.751
<i>Throw it in the old subtlety bin.</i>

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.912
...great to hear someone else
say that out loud.

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.759
Hard to explain.

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:37.756
<i>And there is a thing, I think,</i>
<i>where you can't...</i>

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:40.308
<i>To really love someone else,</i>
<i>you've got to touch...</i>

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:42.755
<i>you've got to get their love</i>
<i>for their children.</i>

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:44.478
<i>Or else you're not getting them.</i>

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:46.916
This is the job. These are the decisions.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.753
Worrying about your children is sanity.

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:54.356
And being that sane, the way you are,
can drive you nuts.

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.675
Someone like you, I'm sorry.

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.718
If you think you're at some crossroads,
you are.

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.032
<i>This is also one of those instances...</i>

01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:09.396
<i>where music can make or break something...</i>

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:11.755
<i>where we, I think,</i>
<i>had something in the temp...</i>

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:13.592
<i>that was a little heavier-handed.</i>

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:16.752
<i>And we were always worried that</i>
<i>we were pushing romance too much.</i>

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:20.753
<i>And now there's this sweet,</i>
<i>but haunting little melody underneath...</i>

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:25.470
<i>that tells you something else is happening,</i>
<i>but it's not throwing it at you.</i>

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.588
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:30.591
How did you become that man?

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:34.994
I don't know.

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:36.991
<i>There was an answer I had in the script...</i>

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:39.071
<i>where she says,</i>
<i>"How did you become that man?"</i>

01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:41.833
<i>He says, "Two Jews meet in the desert,</i>
<i>you wait 5,000 years...</i>

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:44.388
<i>"bingo, another guy</i>
<i>sees trouble coming a mile away...</i>

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.118
<i>"doesn't know what to do about it."</i>

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:48.634
<i>And everybody just stared at that joke,</i>
<i>except me.</i>

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:58.949
I didn't mean to... I want to be helpful.

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:05.111
It must be hard being a widow,
doing it on your own.

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:10.998
Why do you think I am a widow?

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.398
I guess I thought...

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:22.113
that would be the only way...

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:25.397
<i>This is the only time in the movie</i>
<i>she's an absolute girl.</i>

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.553
<i>- That's true.</i>
<i>- Free of everything.</i>

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:28.914
So, okay...

01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:32.511
are you gonna send her?

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:35.639
I don't know.

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:40.277
I think if I do, one of two things happens.

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:45.353
Either she will be odd?

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:47.598
Odd, yes.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:50.678
Or she will make herself the same as them.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:56.758
I felt the same way
about my kid going there.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:01.275
So between odd and the same,
you gotta be rooting for odd, don't you?

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.759
Yes, you gotta.

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:06.957
<i>I guess it's too late to ask but,</i>
<i>is that the way most people feel?</i>

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:14.109
<i>I didn't think to check that out,</i>
<i>I just assumed that I was right in step.</i>

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:17.397
<i>They are probably two schools of thought</i>
<i>on that one.</i>

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:18.754
<i>There are, huh?</i>

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.671
You speaking English, it's...

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:28.071
- What?
- Nothing.

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:34.833
It's nice meeting you.

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:40.789
<i>Again, lines that I think</i>
<i>we cut out for a while...</i>

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:42.279
<i>which I think are so important...</i>

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:45.113
<i>because she's the same person</i>
<i>but a different person...</i>

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:45.680
<i>but it's the first time he's truly met her...</i>

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.750
<i>but it's the first time he's truly met her...</i>

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:50.274
<i>because she can now really communicate.</i>

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:53.159
<i>And I think those lines are amazing.</i>

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:55.390
<i>It's always about lines</i>
<i>that you fall in love with.</i>

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:58.711
<i>The notion in movies is you have</i>
<i>to kill your darling.</i>

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:02.509
<i>Nobody ever talks about how every once</i>
<i>in a while you have to save one of them.</i>

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:08.039
I picked up your books yesterday.

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:11.635
I put them
in one of Bernie's old, ancient backpacks.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.594
Thank you. This is gonna be a great school.

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:17.557
I can tell by the weight.

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:21.352
I got her just a little
first-day-at-a-new-school...

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:22.634
<i>Somebody...</i>

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.910
<i>I forget who it was.</i>
<i>Somebody came up to me.</i>

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.436
<i>This controversial character that Téa plays</i>
<i>and says that, you know...</i>

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:33.235
<i>it was so great 'cause he said...</i>

01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:36.118
<i>He referenced that he had been...</i>

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:37.792
<i>That his wife was a little like Téa.</i>

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:40.758
<i>And then he said how he had spotted</i>
<i>the jeweller where I got that.</i>

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:43.638
<i>He was right. Which he bought for his...</i>

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:49.988
It's from all of us. Your mum, too.

01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:53.278
It's not from me.

01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:59.353
Let's get going. Don't be late. Come on.

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.953
Thank you so much for this opportunity.

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:11.033
And everything.

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.671
Have a great year, girls.

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:19.472
This is so great.

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:21.879
<i>She's totally out of her game.</i>

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:26.670
<i>This is, you could say,</i>
<i>"Entered a foreign land."</i>

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.872
<i>Spiritually, in every way.</i>
<i>Not knowing what to do.</i>

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:32.474
<i>No control over her kid.</i>
<i>No control over her life.</i>

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:42.029
Left.

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.754
No left.

01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:53.713
<i>When we filmed this...</i>

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.155
<i>Paz had always talked</i>
<i>about having been an athlete.</i>

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.753
<i>She was a competitive swimmer.</i>

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:06.872
<i>And she is this quick,</i>
<i>and Téa is a distance girl...</i>

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:10.509
<i>and that part was absolutely true.</i>
<i>They had to do a lot of running for this.</i>

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.918
<i>It's a pretty steep hill, too.</i>

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:22.717
You know, I ran college track. Watch out.

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:26.156
<i>What was the longest version of this, Richie,</i>
<i>that we looked at?</i>

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:30.199
<i>I think this... We had a version that was</i>
<i>probably about five or six minutes long...</i>

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:32.236
<i>of this race.</i>

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:34.311
<i>This is like 40 seconds or something?</i>

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:39.672
<i>No, it's a little longer than that.</i>
<i>It's maybe two minutes.</i>

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:40.988
<i>Really?</i>

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:42.519
<i>Minute and a half.</i>

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:43.749
See you.

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.591
I love you for trying!

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:57.433
When people exist under one roof,
a tiny society forms...

01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:00.315
the stuff of novellas...

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:05.395
masters and servants
unconsciously dancing in lock step...

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:07.990
so that when things go wrong...

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.551
traumas converge.

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:16.352
At Mrs. Clasky's urging, I had invited
two of my friends to her house...

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.156
though I was expected at home.

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:24.319
Monica had finally managed
to get her mother here from Mexico...

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:26.675
and my mother was making a party.

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.719
Flor? Deb.

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:40.109
Sorry to call you so late.

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.760
But the girls are still studying
and I gotta go out.

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.478
I know I promised to get her back...

01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.710
so if you want me
to cut off the schoolwork...

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:48.677
that's fine, whatever you want.

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.314
Let me think.

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:56.555
<i>You know, in a way Shelbie is playing</i>
<i>as dicey a character...</i>

01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.314
<i>as Téa is.</i>

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:00.838
<i>'Cause she's just up for grabs.</i>

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:03.710
<i>She's certainly not a child you deplore...</i>

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.515
<i>and yet, she's a kid and she's falling for it.</i>

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:11.993
<i>Just a flash of guilt.</i>

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:15.433
<i>And back to</i> Charlie's Angels.

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:31.198
<i>The party's always so interesting</i>
<i>because it's been a long time...</i>

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:32.952
<i>since we've seen Flor in her element...</i>

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:35.235
<i>'cause we've been at the beach so long.</i>

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:39.438
<i>So you almost forget that she has</i>
<i>that other culture, that other life.</i>

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:48.789
Wait. I need to talk to you privately, honey.

01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:52.069
<i>One thing I wasn't able to quite get...</i>

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:55.152
<i>and part of it was because you got</i>
<i>this wonderful ride of Cloris...</i>

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:58.073
<i>but, it was always the intent...</i>

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.431
<i>that at a certain point things shift...</i>

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:02.358
<i>and the parent who raised you...</i>

01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:05.871
<i>is now dependent on you</i>
<i>and is terrified about your goodwill.</i>

01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.873
<i>So that she spent her time</i>
<i>avoiding her daughter...</i>

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:13.476
<i>and trying not to get her attention</i>
<i>in any way.</i>

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:14.913
<i>So at the end of the picture...</i>

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.594
<i>in the script stage,</i>
<i>this was going to be enormous...</i>

01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:21.036
<i>how much she demanded a confrontation,</i>
<i>to do this for her.</i>

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.793
...you are going to lose your husband...

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:26.440
if you don't stop what you are doing.

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:29.478
And you will never find someone as good.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:34.955
There'll only be men who
you know are cheap and shallow...

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:38.073
and have no real warmth in their souls.

01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:41.751
You may have gotten by
on those surfaces once but now...

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:44.308
you have been spoiled by a good man.

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.436
If you do not act quickly...

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.508
you will soon cement an awful fate
for yourself...

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:52.273
a life with no hope of repair...

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:56.911
which has already
begun to turn desperate and dumb.

01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:00.750
That's it. Drive carefully.

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:04.914
Out of coffee. It's over for me.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.788
You've done it again, Mother.
Made me hate myself.

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.675
One of the things that I can count on.

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:15.631
<i>Her problem is so great</i>
<i>'cause she's neither heavy nor heroine.</i>

01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:19.235
<i>So there's no clear "What's she gonna do?"</i>

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:24.595
<i>In the middle of everything</i>
<i>Deborah has to deal...</i>

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:27.513
<i>with this sober, self-confident,</i>
<i>stronger mum.</i>

01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:33.276
<i>It's such a great moment</i>
<i>to have Cloris' character...</i>

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:36.796
<i>finally just talk back to her daughter...</i>

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:39.633
<i>who hasn't shown a lot of respect</i>
<i>throughout the movie to her.</i>

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:42.188
<i>And she's absolutely right</i>
<i>in what she's saying.</i>

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.471
<i>Only people with problems now.</i>

01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:58.028
<i>And I always felt...</i>

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:01.109
<i>you know, emotionally, at this point...</i>

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.276
<i>Flor was aware that</i>
<i>she was crazy about the guy.</i>

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:08.269
Better wait a minute.

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.590
<i>He's still slugging out day-to-day life.</i>

01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:12.477
- What the hell is wrong?
- Nothing.

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:16.599
Can I urge you, in all hopelessness,
not to go in there?

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:25.917
<i>And it was always...</i>
<i>We backed away from it a few times.</i>

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.309
<i>It seemed crazy,</i>
<i>but I always couldn't resist...</i>

01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:32.548
<i>that what she's about to tell him</i>
<i>we get into...</i>

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:35.950
<i>as if Lucy dented the car</i>
<i>and she has to tell Desi.</i>

01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:43.749
I suddenly get what I gotta do,
but I just gotta get up the guts.

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:46.400
Is it absolutely necessary to make it...

01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:48.516
<i>Sometimes, riding this edge</i>
<i>got us into trouble.</i>

01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:50.431
<i>We had so many discussions about it.</i>

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.670
<i>But we all couldn't resist this, finally.</i>

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:55.718
<i>Just this moment coming up.</i>

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:59.074
<i>Which made things a little tougher for us,</i>
<i>I think.</i>

01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:05.036
<i>Changing her tone in this always seemed</i>
<i>to destroy the rest of the scene.</i>

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.118
<i>You wanted to feel her reaction...</i>

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:13.828
<i>was in keeping with</i>
<i>the personality of hers...</i>

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.717
<i>that we presented all through the film.</i>

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.274
<i>This whole part.</i>

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.151
<i>And the other guy backed into a ravine.</i>

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.235
<i>And Adam's playing</i>
<i>always got us back on track.</i>

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:31.039
<i>Just the way he did it here.</i>
<i>Just got us back on track.</i>

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:34.635
<i>My memory of editing this scene...</i>

01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:38.349
<i>was, it never changed that much...</i>

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:41.591
<i>but the fine points drove us crazy.</i>

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:45.790
<i>There were many attempts</i>
<i>to change performance...</i>

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:50.431
<i>and yet ultimately I think this is very close</i>
<i>to Richie's first cut on it, I think...</i>

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:54.399
<i>what we finally settled with.</i>
<i>It was just a look-see kind of process...</i>

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:58.519
<i>to see if anything would change,</i>
<i>and this was definitely the best.</i>

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:00.830
<i>What was remarkable at the beginning...</i>

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.958
<i>when he first walks in</i>
<i>and she's in that little cubbyhole...</i>

01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:08.750
<i>whenever we played it in a less funny way...</i>

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.560
<i>it just changed the tone of the entire scene.</i>

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:13.790
<i>And then we had a problem</i>
<i>with one preview...</i>

01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:16.314
<i>'cause we got laughs</i>
<i>a little too deep into the scene...</i>

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:18.516
<i>on one specific moment,</i>
<i>the way he did a hand.</i>

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:21.592
<i>And that was driving us crazy,</i>
<i>just to maintain control...</i>

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:24.957
<i>and bring them into the drama of the scene</i>
<i>at a certain point.</i>

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:28.715
<i>Also, it was strange trying to interpret...</i>

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:31.075
<i>which were laughs at the characters...</i>

01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:35.518
<i>and which were those uncomfortable laughs</i>
<i>where people just feel...</i>

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:40.832
<i>so in tune with what's happening</i>
<i>that they're uncomfortable with it.</i>

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:44.558
<i>Yeah. I think that people definitely</i>
<i>get that little giggle...</i>

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:46.039
<i>when they're uncomfortable.</i>

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:49.757
<i>Plus, the dialogue is still witty.</i>

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.639
<i>So you're still saying things</i>
<i>that people get...</i>

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:56.235
<i>and have little laugh moments to.</i>

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.797
Just give me a second.

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:03.231
<i>I always felt what happens so often</i>
<i>in these situations in life...</i>

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:06.437
<i>where I thought he was the hero,</i>
<i>what happens in these situations...</i>

01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:08.351
<i>is the questions don't stop for months.</i>

01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:11.557
<i>Where'd he touch you? What did you do?</i>
<i>That night, you said that...</i>

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:14.154
<i>It just never stops.</i>
<i>And it's the nature of his heroism...</i>

01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:15.878
<i>that somehow in a very simple way...</i>

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:18.839
<i>that doesn't occur to him</i>
<i>to go in that direction.</i>

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:22.877
- Real short answer. Have you had...
- Yes.

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:30.109
Really?

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:36.600
<i>I always thought that was</i>
<i>such an innocent reading.</i>

01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:39.114
...that I was gonna answer
every question you had.

01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:41.031
<i>I remember when we watched it in dailies...</i>

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:45.557
<i>and I was so amazed</i>
<i>that I started to tear up at that "really"...</i>

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:48.234
<i>because it was just that hurt person.</i>

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:50.356
Are you really that much nicer than me?

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:55.670
You don't set the bar real high.

01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:57.795
John, just wait, please.

01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:00.394
<i>Such a great question for her to ask...</i>

01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:04.871
<i>when you get just a bit of sun</i>
<i>breaking into the attic.</i>

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:06.234
<i>You know?</i>

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:17.199
It's just Flor.

01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:22.595
Flor, what are you doing here?

01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:25.149
<i>I remember that was always an issue</i>
<i>of when...</i>

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:28.159
<i>how he reacted to hearing that it was Flor.</i>

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:31.996
<i>Yes. And we always read into it, you know.</i>

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:34.230
<i>I don't even know how</i>
<i>to describe the moment now...</i>

01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:35.878
<i>but I think he played it perfectly.</i>

01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:38.555
<i>I think he went private with it,</i>
<i>even from himself.</i>

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:41.393
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- I think that's sort of what he did.</i>

01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:43.438
...I want us to be good.

01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:45.351
I want us to be close.

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:49.433
I want to feel like you're not nuts
to be in love with me.

01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:52.635
<i>And that's the sort of wild thing</i>
<i>about Deborah...</i>

01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:55.154
<i>'cause as people judge her</i>
<i>on everything else...</i>

01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:57.516
<i>you can't be talking from your heart more...</i>

01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:00.956
<i>than when she says, "I want to feel</i>
<i>you're not nuts to love me. "</i>

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:04.157
<i>That's all about her sense of worthlessness</i>
<i>and her regard for him.</i>

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:06.993
So let's not leave this room
until you've heard...

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:11.998
<i>But never abandoning</i>
<i>her total self-involvement.</i>

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:16.471
<i>No. It's goofy and totally sane</i>
<i>at the same time, I think.</i>

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:17.754
I'm sorry. What?

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:21.076
John? You didn't hear me?

01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:24.194
<i>Now, there was one version</i>
<i>where he had an exit line...</i>

01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:26.157
<i>where she said,</i>
<i>"You had to say something."</i>

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.310
<i>And he says, "You are a terrible wife."</i>

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:31.551
<i>I never would've imagined dropping it...</i>

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:34.518
<i>but it was almost to me a cheap shot</i>
<i>at the very end.</i>

01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:36.995
...when you're feeling this upset...

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:38.798
<i>Although it did make you want to applaud.</i>

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:41.151
<i>Yeah, it was the hero moment...</i>

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:43.277
<i>but it also then threw us into the...</i>

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:46.318
<i>The black hats and white hats, too.</i>

01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:48.591
<i>And, yeah, created... Yeah.</i>

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:50.353
<i>I mean, we just...</i>

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:51.989
<i>It's so weird.</i>

01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:56.517
<i>There is enormous difficulty no matter what.</i>

01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:00.195
<i>'Cause we didn't want,</i>
<i>it's okay for him to drift now...</i>

01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:02.635
<i>because he's a victim. We didn't want that.</i>

01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:05.756
<i>And yet, these two have an agenda.</i>

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.317
- Let me at last say the reason.
- Don't worry about it.

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:19.557
Have you no idea that I...

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:25.476
<i>I am always so thrilled with that moment...</i>

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:28.791
<i>inordinately, beyond all reason...</i>

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:31.599
<i>because it is the moment</i>
<i>when she's finally gonna tell him...</i>

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:35.593
<i>and we have been aggressively building</i>
<i>this little dog joke...</i>

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:38.796
<i>almost from the first moment</i>
<i>we've seen the mutt.</i>

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:40.559
Goodbye, Chum.

01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:49.880
<i>And it's trying to control these tones</i>
<i>that was...</i>

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:55.910
<i>you know, always the glory and the guilt.</i>

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.709
Because, if I don't, I'll worry about you
all night long. I can't handle that now.

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:03.428
<i>I think, early on we looked at this section...</i>

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:06.717
<i>with some temp music that was dramatic...</i>

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.560
<i>and you realise that a lot</i>
<i>of these dialogue scenes...</i>

01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:12.279
<i>could be read as heavy drama...</i>

01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:14.828
<i>if pushed that direction.</i>

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:16.717
<i>Whereas, we've pulled back.</i>

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:20.076
<i>We didn't play music</i>
<i>during the confession scene at all...</i>

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:24.035
<i>and allowed the viewer to feel...</i>

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:26.998
<i>whatever emotion was being presented</i>
<i>versus pushing it.</i>

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:30.478
<i>Nobody would ever guess this was</i>
<i>the hardest scene in the movie.</i>

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:33.472
<i>Because this was, you know,</i>
<i>when we went over the divide.</i>

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:36.478
<i>Finally they're together,</i>
<i>we've avoided it for the whole picture.</i>

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.949
- Very sorry.
- There is the bus stop.

01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:45.798
- Bye.
- Wait, don't go!

01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:51.912
Would you be willing to
hang out with me for a while?

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:56.600
- You want to hang out with me?
- Yes.

01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:04.592
- Then I have to ask you...
- What?

01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:08.636
What does "hang out" mean?

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:11.033
It means...

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:15.109
<i>There was a scene that I loved,</i>
<i>out of context...</i>

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:16.872
<i>where he took her to a supermarket.</i>

01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:19.872
<i>She ordered makeup 'cause she realised</i>
<i>she was gonna be with him.</i>

01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:21.678
<i>So she ran in to put some makeup on.</i>

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:22.120
<i>And he saw her through the door</i>
<i>and he smiled...</i>

01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:23.758
<i>And he saw her through the door</i>
<i>and he smiled...</i>

01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:26.400
<i>and then he saw himself reflected</i>
<i>in the next car window...</i>

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:28.118
<i>and he said, "What are you smiling at?"</i>

01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:30.156
<i>Then he looked at her</i>
<i>and she was beautiful...</i>

01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:32.310
<i>and she smiled, he smiled,</i>
<i>and you couldn't do it.</i>

01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:34.152
<i>In context, you couldn't do it.</i>

01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:39.395
<i>So the nature... It was always going to be</i>
<i>an evening they spent together.</i>

01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:43.553
<i>It was always going to be out of nowhere</i>
<i>you get an island of romantic comedy...</i>

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:45.596
<i>with all this heavy stuff going down.</i>

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.752
<i>It was always going to be that.</i>
<i>Getting her hair down was a big deal.</i>

01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:50.876
<i>Her matching.</i>

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:54.794
<i>And how far we went</i>
<i>and how much they revealed...</i>

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:56.872
<i>was a journey.</i>

01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:59.156
<i>And we're going to show you</i>
<i>outtakes later on...</i>

01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:00.593
<i>about some of the choices we had.</i>

01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:04.389
<i>And the journey was always one of keeping</i>
<i>the innocence of their relationship.</i>

01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:07.438
<i>- Not always, but ultimately, yeah.</i>
<i>- Well, ultimately.</i>

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:13.476
I've never seen your place.

01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:19.672
<i>Because we did have a version...</i>

01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:22.672
<i>where she finally was with the guy</i>
<i>she's been thinking of.</i>

01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:25.718
<i>And she was acting accordingly.</i>

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.155
Please.

01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:34.469
<i>But, I think the one thing</i>
<i>we all learned on this...</i>

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:37.677
<i>learned so that, you know,</i>
<i>what you finally learn...</i>

01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:40.752
<i>is that you're stupid about something</i>
<i>that you think is easy:</i>

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:43.752
<i>How complicated family values</i>
<i>is as a concept...</i>

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.671
<i>how endlessly complicated.</i>

01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:50.472
<i>So I think we knew exactly,</i>
<i>at a certain point...</i>

01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:52.393
<i>that everybody in the audience...</i>

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:56.350
<i>caring for her, caring for him,</i>
<i>but still feeling...</i>

01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:57.949
<i>the sanctity of marriage.</i>

01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:00.554
<i>I think that was finally the conversation...</i>

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:02.756
<i>that we had to have with the audience.</i>

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.468
<i>But it was right to sort of fool around</i>
<i>with that.</i>

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:12.635
Yeah.

01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:36.675
My hand is the only sane part of my body.
Every other part wants to jump off a cliff.

01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:42.550
That's it for now.
I already broke my record for smooth.

01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:46.315
- I don't understand.
- It's me. I'm not making any sense.

01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:48.152
But I can get you fed.

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:57.195
<i>I think, we, at one point,</i>
<i>played that whole thing more romantic.</i>

01:38:58.040 --> 01:38:59.871
<i>And to have them just be awkward...</i>

01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:02.633
<i>makes you love them more</i>
<i>and want them to be together more...</i>

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:05.029
<i>than when they started to feel</i>
<i>for each other.</i>

01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:09.914
Wait. I don't think you should, either.

01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:11.998
Then, excuse me, because...

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:14.514
if I had the equipment,
I think I'd inject the vodka.

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:18.876
<i>The great thing is they've earned the right</i>
<i>to be so easy with each other.</i>

01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:20.871
<i>And they haven't just...</i>

01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:25.115
<i>Nobody is looking at</i>
<i>the elephant in the room.</i>

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:28.038
<i>She's aware of it.</i>

01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:33.159
It's very good.

01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:37.675
<i>And I think this is the moment</i>
<i>when she absolutely fell in love, coming up.</i>

01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:42.555
I wouldn't have put it so well.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.150
Let's get this going here.

01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:51.958
<i>Nothing or anybody like him.</i>

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:05.518
<i>So many different women said to me...</i>

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:08.353
<i>there's nothing sexier</i>
<i>than a man cooking for you.</i>

01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:12.076
<i>Which surprised me</i>
<i>and sort of sent me to the cookbook.</i>

01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:14.630
<i>I think it depends on what you're cooking.</i>

01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:17.834
<i>Spaghetti O's doesn't really do it.</i>

01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:24.670
So, tell me again
why I can't call him on his cell again?

01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:26.876
Besides that he turned it off?

01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:31.955
- Yeah.
- Forty messages start to look needy.

01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:46.915
<i>These two women</i>
<i>loved working with each other.</i>

01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:50.199
<i>You can see it. They're so great together.</i>

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.911
Not in the way you think.

01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:59.312
You are enjoying it?

01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:02.915
<i>And they were thrilled to work with</i>
<i>physical stuff with each other.</i>

01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:05.276
...enjoying actually being of use
to my daughter.

01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:09.433
I'm enjoying the fact that I really
know how to advise you...

01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:13.713
and the miracle
that you are so deeply disoriented...

01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:16.314
that you are gobbling up everything I say.

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:20.597
<i>They both have the same nervous energy...</i>

01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:23.274
<i>which makes it so believable</i>
<i>that they are related.</i>

01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:24.955
What?

01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:30.232
There's something I want to say to you
about you and me.

01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:33.554
- You don't have to.
- No, I want to.

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:36.313
- Okay?
- Thank you.

01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:41.670
You were an alcoholic
and wildly promiscuous woman...

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:45.230
during my formative years,
so I'm in this fix because of you.

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.158
It is your fault.

01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:50.509
I just needed that moment for us
to build on.

01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:54.388
<i>This late in the picture,</i>
<i>when you've dealt with an audience...</i>

01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:58.720
<i>what Téa just said resonated with them.</i>

01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:01.314
<i>That's why she's the way she is.</i>

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:04.992
<i>It's the latest basic exposition</i>
<i>I think I'll ever do.</i>

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.639
<i>We just cut the asparagus</i>
<i>out of the airline version.</i>

01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:15.153
<i>We had to, man.</i>

01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:18.118
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>whether it was for sexual reasons or...</i>

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:23.315
<i>This woman ate more asparagus that day</i>
<i>than any human in one sitting.</i>

01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:25.960
<i>- More and better.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:29.870
I keep thinking I should tell you
what happened to me tonight.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.195
But I don't want to spoil this.

01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:46.157
I will remember every taste forever.

01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:50.191
I'm very glad you liked it.

01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:53.076
It's something, watching you.

01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:57.879
If it's anything at your end,
imagine over here.

01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:01.077
<i>It's so interesting 'cause I think</i>
<i>we all became so acutely aware...</i>

01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:03.037
<i>'cause we had so many previews</i>
<i>of this movie.</i>

01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:06.476
<i>But the part of making a movie</i>
<i>that's a communication with an audience...</i>

01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:10.068
<i>when she says,</i>
<i>"Tell me everything about my beauty"...</i>

01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:12.628
<i>that was always a laugh,</i>
<i>people were always on her side.</i>

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:14.631
<i>There was always discomfort when he did it.</i>

01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:17.518
<i>It was always so weird that way,</i>
<i>both things existing.</i>

01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:20.398
Staring is the only way
that makes any sense.

01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:24.073
And trying not to blink,
so you don't miss anything.

01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:31.149
And all of that, and you're you.

01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:34.790
<i>Adam kills me here.</i>

01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:37.394
Look, forgive me.

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:41.191
It's just you are drop-dead, crazy gorgeous.

01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:45.275
<i>Absolutely original</i>
<i>and you just believe every second.</i>

01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:49.110
<i>Didn't we have some woman</i>
<i>in a focus group say:</i>

01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:52.237
<i>"I wish I could find a man like him,</i>
<i>exactly like him. "</i>

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:53.594
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- She was just all...</i>

01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:56.753
<i>I think he's the guy...</i>

01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:59.798
<i>when you read those things in magazines...</i>

01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:02.155
<i>about what qualities do you want in a man.</i>

01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:05.756
<i>They don't always mention...</i>

01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:08.436
<i>the Semitic thing,</i>
<i>but everything else is up there.</i>

01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:20.113
<i>The line coming up...</i>

01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:22.919
<i>which happened on the set...</i>

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.389
<i>became just vital to everything</i>
<i>that happened after that.</i>

01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:28.278
<i>You just couldn't have lived for a second</i>
<i>without it.</i>

01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:29.959
<i>What he's about to say right here.</i>

01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:33.994
We can't do anything that brings us
any kind of satisfaction or release.

01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:36.909
But I'm still having a great time.

01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:44.114
My mother has often referred
to that evening at the restaurant...

01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:46.316
as the conversation of her life.

01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:49.995
Ever since that night at the beach...

01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:54.237
if I knew you were in a room,
I just wouldn't go in there.

01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:59.277
When I hear you coming, I leave.

01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:05.072
That's why we haven't
seen each other a lot lately.

01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:09.234
Why is everything so damn confusing?

01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:19.075
Is your mind racing, too?

01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:21.071
I'd say my mind has evaporated.

01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:24.232
Feels pretty good.

01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:26.599
Like happy?

01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:29.874
<i>Paz is, you know...</i>

01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:33.234
<i>there's just almost no way to deal with her.</i>

01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:37.272
<i>That she's an original beauty,</i>
<i>that she's that beautiful...</i>

01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:38.952
<i>that she's a character actress...</i>

01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:42.271
<i>that she can do comedy.</i>

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:45.348
<i>She just is such a total talent.</i>

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:50.473
<i>And she was learning English on this film.</i>

01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:54.796
<i>And looking, she's just so...</i>

01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:57.720
<i>You've never seen anybody</i>
<i>quite like her before.</i>

01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:00.071
...have entered your brain.

01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:04.357
Don't hide that from me.

01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:09.396
<i>I'm always amazed in this scene how...</i>

01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:14.275
<i>we're allowed to stay in so close</i>
<i>for so long...</i>

01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:19.150
<i>'cause you're just studying their faces</i>
<i>and their reactions...</i>

01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:21.037
<i>and it just creates an intimacy.</i>

01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:23.793
<i>They are so intimate.</i>
<i>What she says to him is so intimate.</i>

01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:27.668
<i>She hits him on such a deep level,</i>
<i>they skip the natural stops.</i>

01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:38.279
There are some mistakes you cannot risk
when you have children.

01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:42.792
<i>I remember, originally you had blocked them</i>
<i>a little differently...</i>

01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:44.916
<i>and once we saw them sitting like this...</i>

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:48.072
<i>they were so comfortable with each other...</i>

01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:51.675
<i>that suddenly their performances changed.</i>
<i>Everything about them changed.</i>

01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:58.556
Once our feet touch that floor,
I'm gonna get too many brain cells back.

01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:00.517
Don't be in such a hurry.

01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:06.909
<i>He's been playing catch-up for so long,</i>
<i>he's just trying to put it together.</i>

01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:39.555
<i>I love the consciousness of the decision</i>
<i>to tell him...</i>

01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:41.437
<i>and I think his reaction just...</i>

01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:47.275
- I love you.
- What?

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:50.274
<i>It just makes him happy</i>
<i>that somebody like that...</i>

01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:56.435
<i>And he gets her right away.</i>

01:47:56.520 --> 01:47:58.954
<i>He gets that they can't take it</i>
<i>an inch further.</i>

01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:06.714
<i>Could've held on that longer.</i>

01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:10.712
<i>- We couldn't have.</i>
<i>- We tried?</i>

01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:12.119
<i>There was no more.</i>

01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:16.038
<i>We're still getting cutting notes.</i>

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:20.953
<i>This was simply the answer.</i>

01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:24.112
<i>She's gonna go to the door</i>
<i>and Cloris has to stop her some way.</i>

01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:27.989
<i>The women came up with this.</i>
<i>Love that their feet are dirty.</i>

01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:41.432
Then trust me...

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:45.630
and only allow yourself
to say one thing to him.

01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:47.634
One thing.

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:50.516
"I am so glad you're back."

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:52.799
- What?
- Yes.

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:56.479
But I have to know whether he touched her.

01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:00.357
And where he touched her,
and how he touched her...

01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:04.110
<i>She had a long...</i>

01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:06.270
<i>sort of like wild speech.</i>

01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:10.114
<i>'Cause this is about Mum telling her she</i>
<i>has to shove her ego back in the bottle...</i>

01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:12.430
<i>which seems impossible...</i>

01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:14.875
<i>so there was greater resistance at one point.</i>

01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:18.436
- So now I...
- Go to him.

01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:22.551
- Jesus, do I need a little makeup?
- You need a hose.

01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:27.149
But you don't have the time.
It's fine that you look like that.

01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:30.198
It's genuine. You can use genuine.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.673
<i>I do believe</i>
<i>their whole relationship changed...</i>

01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:37.397
<i>and you believe it changed...</i>

01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:39.669
<i>totally.</i>

01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:43.275
<i>You know, at that moment,</i>
<i>I think they earned the change, those two.</i>

01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:44.800
<i>We found that the tone of this</i>
<i>could only go one way.</i>

01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:47.792
<i>We found that the tone of this</i>
<i>could only go one way.</i>

01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:54.072
It's late, Deborah.

01:49:57.440 --> 01:49:59.590
I just wanted to say...

01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:09.750
I can't sleep upstairs with you.
I just can't for now.

01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:16.356
I'm just so glad you're back.

01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:21.399
<i>'Cause at one point...</i>

01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:24.638
<i>there was fun with her</i>
<i>just having this one line she could say...</i>

01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:27.518
<i>but you just had to honour the moment.</i>

01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:55.397
I'm done tonight, Deb.

01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:00.039
I don't think we can jam anything else in.

01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:01.879
It's me, Dad.

01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:07.272
What's wrong, honey?

01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:11.869
I just wanted to check
that you were back and okay.

01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:15.074
I'm okay.

01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:20.674
Because?

01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:23.633
<i>I think they had</i>
<i>their relationship out there, the two of them.</i>

01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:25.950
<i>I think what Adam keeps on doing...</i>

01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:29.592
<i>is simply doing the wonder</i>
<i>of what a good guy is...</i>

01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:32.194
<i>what a big deal it is</i>
<i>to be a thoroughly good guy.</i>

01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:37.838
I just hate that you had that kind of night.

01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:39.793
<i>Look at this kid here.</i>

01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:47.034
It's good for me to worry about
something that really matters...

01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:49.398
<i>That's what you should do on DVDs.</i>

01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:52.472
<i>Without goofy talking.</i>
<i>You know, "Look at this kid."</i>

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.197
<i>It's really what it boils down to.</i>
<i>You're just trying to say it fancy.</i>

01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:57.759
Surviving?

01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:00.914
<i>Look at him.</i>

01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:04.359
<i>- Look at them together.</i>
<i>- Ain't it something?</i>

01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:07.038
<i>That's all you're trying to say.</i>

01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:09.275
I love you.

01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:12.832
<i>That's a great "I love you."</i>

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:16.279
I mean, not about me being fantastic.
But just...

01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:22.150
- Sleep well.
- Wait. What?

01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:32.079
Sweetheart.

01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:39.599
<i>There were several lines she had there</i>
<i>that I loved.</i>

01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:43.399
<i>It finally was overstatement.</i>

01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:46.278
<i>But basically, in a stumbling way,</i>
<i>she let us know...</i>

01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:49.158
<i>that she understood</i>
<i>that he had come back...</i>

01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:51.470
<i>and what it represented,</i>
<i>and she thanked him.</i>

01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:56.438
<i>It was one of those things</i>
<i>that was extraordinary in dailies...</i>

01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:58.158
<i>and in context it was too much.</i>

01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:02.237
<i>Nobody missed that door ever.</i>

01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:04.871
<i>You know, it's amazing how they pick...</i>

01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:07.474
<i>That little decal. Yes, always.</i>

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:16.910
Hey, Mum. Is it okay
if we don't leave right away, please?

01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:18.594
No.

01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:20.992
Just let me explain, please.

01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:22.911
No. We must say goodbye.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.151
Bernice is going to let me use her computer.
This is for school.

01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:29.789
- For school. Just listen to me.
- I don't work here anymore.

01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:36.509
No, that's not fair.

01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:39.915
You can't do this to me.

01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:46.431
<i>And in a very quiet way, this has been</i>
<i>the key relationship in the movie.</i>

01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:49.557
<i>This is what the movie's about.</i>
<i>There's been a lot else going on.</i>

01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:54.273
- Do I have to get out?
- No, Georgie. Stay.

01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:04.315
I think you are a wonderful boy.

01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:07.076
Be good, like you are.

01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:08.957
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:12.039
I can't believe you didn't get out.

01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:16.913
<i>Lan served such a good purpose 'cause</i>
<i>it was to break every Mary Poppins notion...</i>

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:21.312
<i>that could be hidden anyplace</i>
<i>because they just never hooked up.</i>

01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:23.436
<i>The young boy in the pool.</i>

01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:29.518
You are a beauty.

01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:35.354
Come on.

01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:39.398
Last chance to have some of you
rub off on me.

01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:44.635
Listen, I'm sorry that you're sad,
but this could have been so much worse.

01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:48.793
Why don't you run upstairs
and say goodbye to Deborah?

01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:50.154
I'm coming.

01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:52.910
<i>And with Bernice, there's never a question...</i>

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.037
<i>that she knows everything</i>
<i>actually and poetically.</i>

01:54:56.800 --> 01:54:59.234
<i>I guess that's what you mean</i>
<i>by being an old soul.</i>

01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:02.271
I live my life for myself.

01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:04.879
<i>The wet is great on her.</i>

01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:08.598
None of it works.

01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:13.992
Thank you, Evelyn.

01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:16.796
<i>Good for a movie to have a message.</i>

01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:22.110
- We're leaving for good.
- It's okay.

01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:25.112
- We're not coming back!
- It's okay.

01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:28.670
We're still gonna see each other at school.
Come on.

01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:30.876
I'm gonna keep my eye on you.

01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:33.076
Come on. No, no.

01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:35.833
I got some great things for you.
Want a computer?

01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:03.239
<i>Such a great shot.</i>

01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:09.196
Can't give you guys a lift, huh?

01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:23.355
God bless the guy who gets you.

01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:35.231
<i>I love all the random stuff.</i>

01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:41.393
<i>Kept on going crazy when people realised</i>
<i>that she actually was given an old computer.</i>

01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:47.991
<i>I always liked party favours.</i>

01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:52.115
<i>It looks like an old computer</i>
<i>and a quilty pillow.</i>

01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:55.795
<i>It's a combination of a stuffed dog.</i>

01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:00.278
<i>And it's good here</i>
<i>the relationships that never quite existed...</i>

01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:03.079
<i>that the barriers were always there...</i>

01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:06.351
<i>except these two people crossed them.</i>

01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:16.995
<i>I went crazy about how softly to play</i>
"mi amour"...

01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:20.038
<i>I actually was certifiable at one point</i>
<i>when I told somebody:</i>

01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:21.960
<i>"I'd like 30/% of the audience to be able</i>
<i>to hear what she said. "</i>

01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:23.791
<i>"I'd like 30/% of the audience to be able</i>
<i>to hear what she said. "</i>

01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:26.269
<i>And I saw people looking at me:</i>

01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:28.920
<i>"You know, you've gone over the edge."</i>

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.117
<i>So I said, "Okay, 60/%," and that was normal.</i>

01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:39.079
Can I sleep at the Claskys'
when I stay late at school?

01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:40.957
Shortly after we left...

01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:44.316
my mother told me of another decision
she had reached.

01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:47.959
I would no longer go to the private school.

01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:49.714
No!

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.991
You can't do that to me!

01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.797
You ruined everything.

01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:07.150
This ruins my life! You've ruined everything!

01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:09.755
I will never forgive you.

01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:14.470
No, it'll never be all right. You're wrong.

01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:17.552
This is exactly what I was worried about.

01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:21.393
I will never be able to forgive you!

01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:29.758
I have a scholarship!
And nobody gives this up!

01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:34.758
The 1.3 miles from the Clasky house
to our bus stop...

01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:38.879
<i>That behaviour, you know,</i>
<i>is unthinkable for a Mexican kid.</i>

01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:40.188
<i>Unthinkable.</i>

01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:42.714
<i>You know, just culturally to do this</i>
<i>would be...</i>

01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:45.712
<i>It's not as unthinkable for an American kid...</i>

01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:48.189
<i>an American kid who lives</i>
<i>in this neighbourhood.</i>

01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:54.909
What did spark our climactic moment...

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.639
was my use of a common American phrase.

01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:01.035
Not right now. I need some space.

01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:05.511
Not a space between us.

01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:14.157
In the midst of confrontation,
she found clarity.

01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:32.719
She expressed regret
that she had to ask me...

01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:35.633
to deal with the basic question of my life.

01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:37.631
<i>I'm just thinking about how...</i>

01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:40.949
<i>daring, and yet successful it is...</i>

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:44.589
<i>to play the last huge scene in a movie</i>
<i>in a completely different language.</i>

01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:46.318
<i>I mean, that's how we started, but...</i>

01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:49.631
<i>Well, that was the great thing...</i>

01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:51.233
<i>that never got in the way...</i>

01:59:51.320 --> 01:59:53.754
<i>that people sat still,</i>
<i>waiting for the translation...</i>

01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:57.230
<i>got accustomed to it,</i>
<i>it never hurt the tension of scenes.</i>

01:59:57.320 --> 02:00:01.950
<i>That was the best part of the experience,</i>
<i>I think, that, that happened.</i>

02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:25.958
I have been overwhelmed.

02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:29.791
<i>This narration just came very late</i>
<i>in the game.</i>

02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:33.953
<i>It always amazed me that people wondered</i>
<i>whether she got into Princeton.</i>

02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:38.109
<i>And this was designed to take care of that.</i>

02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:41.800
<i>I never quite understood</i>
<i>why that question...</i>

02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:44.758
<i>really was important for the audience.</i>

02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:46.910
My identity rests firmly...

02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:51.510
<i>'Cause it always seemed that it was</i>
<i>the resolution of the relationship...</i>

02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:53.318
<i>that was most important.</i>

02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:10.597
Thank you. Cristina Moreno.

02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:32.753
<i>It was one of the longest</i>
<i>casting processes ever...</i>

02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:35.070
<i>and they were a great group.</i>

02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:37.154
<i>How long were you guys casting?</i>

02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:40.550
<i>You know, I couldn't exaggerate it.</i>
<i>I mean, if I said...</i>

02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:44.758
<i>in some respects... Well, first of all,</i>
<i>I spoke to Téa two years before...</i>

02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:48.990
<i>but it was long, and more than long...</i>

02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:52.675
<i>in terms of number of hours,</i>
<i>you know, auditioning...</i>

02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:54.637
<i>for some of those key parts.</i>

02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:57.913
<i>For the part Paz got.</i>

02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:59.479
<i>Paz and Bernice.</i>

02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:02.028
<i>- You know, and Bernice.</i>
<i>- That's huge.</i>

02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:29.914
<i>The thing that you learn</i>
<i>when you start doing movies...</i>

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.116
<i>and it's extraordinary...</i>

02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:34.395
<i>how deep into the credits...</i>

02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:37.520
<i>if anybody does something wrong...</i>

02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:38.953
<i>it really hurts the movie.</i>

02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:54.917
<i>Come on, we're not gonna</i>
<i>watch the whole crawl.</i>

02:02:56.760 --> 02:02:58.591
<i>Well, there is a joke at the end.</i>

02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:05.315
<i>A little one, but maybe</i>
<i>not worth waiting four minutes for.</i>

02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:10.715
<i>We could try and quickly talk about</i>
<i>every single person that comes up.</i>

02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:16.029
<i>- Say one word about every name.</i>
<i>- You could.</i>

02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:18.994
<i>More than one.</i>

02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:25.071
<i>Look at that, people you lived with,</i>
<i>you said that, just as the people...</i>

02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:27.037
<i>I know, and then I got shut up.</i>

02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:30.837
<i>I just said "yea" to everybody.</i>

02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:32.672
<i>Wonderful sound people.</i>

02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:37.633
<i>- It's so fun to watch her correct herself.</i>
<i>- I love everyone.</i>

02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:42.238
<i>But it's the truth.</i>

02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:44.278
<i>That's why it's always...</i>

02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:49.674
<i>- Biggest of team sports.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:10.872
<i>Always funny, in a movie like this...</i>

02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:13.315
<i>you wouldn't think</i>
<i>it has visual effects people...</i>

02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:16.870
<i>so you wanna say, "Yeah, one of</i>
<i>the characters was completely animated. "</i>

02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:39.756
<i>Taking a while to get to this joke, huh?</i>

02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:41.159
<i>Oh, malice on that one.</i>

02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:44.835
<i>- Now you feel bad, right?</i>
<i>- This is called the time joke?</i>

02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:47.275
<i>I'm not even gonna point it out. Don't worry.</i>

02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:50.272
<i>Take my word for it,</i>
<i>there's a little something in there.</i>
