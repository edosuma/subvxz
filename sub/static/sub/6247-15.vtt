00:45.520 --> 00:48.512
<i>- Temperance.
- Ohh!</i>

00:48.600 --> 00:51.990
- I startled you?
- I was chatting with a friend online.

00:52.080 --> 00:56.358
I'm sorry. But we have a
new delivery, top priority.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.995
- Sounds like a good friend.
- Yes.

01:06.080 --> 01:11.518
It's fascinating how interest and
intimacy can be cultivated online.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.477
So you've never met this friend?

01:13.560 --> 01:16.154
I've done enough Googling
to schedule dinner.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.276
You said there was a delivery?

01:18.360 --> 01:22.797
- The bones washed up on Chesapeake Bay.
- He's been fish food for quite a while.

01:22.880 --> 01:26.316
- They ate through both tibiae.
- Evidence of bullet wounds.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.675
Which explains why he
has all those holes.

01:28.760 --> 01:32.469
Looks as though they weren't
made by a. 32. Maybe a. 38.

01:32.560 --> 01:36.473
- Heard you need a face.
- The FBI's pretty certain this is James Cugini.

01:36.560 --> 01:39.233
They're looking for evidence
to lead to the killer.

01:39.320 --> 01:41.595
<i>- Jimmy Cugini.
- Who?</i>

01:41.680 --> 01:45.832
A mob boss who disappeared six years
ago after his daughter's dance recitaI.

01:45.920 --> 01:48.036
Cement shoes. Pretty trite.

01:48.120 --> 01:51.430
Why mess with the classics?

01:52.080 --> 01:54.435
- They find any of the bullets?
- No.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.556
They really are quite good at this.

01:56.640 --> 01:59.871
Should we be involved in mob
stuff? They're really into killing.

01:59.960 --> 02:04.158
I can provide ajob description if you've
forgotten what we do here, Dr Hodgins.

02:04.240 --> 02:08.312
After you clean him up, Zack, x
- ray the bones for any bullet fragments.

02:08.400 --> 02:13.599
Be carefuI with the exit and entrance wounds.
I want to recover any markings the bullet left.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.353
I could have 'em ready
about eight tonight.

02:16.440 --> 02:20.115
Can't work tonight.
Tomorrow morning's fine.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.795
- You have a date tonight.
- It's not a date. It's a meaI.

02:23.880 --> 02:26.474
- With a man?
- Did you meet him on that website?

02:26.560 --> 02:29.950
- You're dating online?
- It's a practicaI way

02:30.040 --> 02:34.158
of objectively examining a potentiaI
partner without all the game playing.

02:34.240 --> 02:37.357
That comes later, if it
works out. Hi, I'm Angela.

02:37.440 --> 02:40.989
SpeciaI Agent Jamie
Kenton. Hi. Dr Brennan.

02:41.080 --> 02:43.230
Hey.

02:44.480 --> 02:46.118
You two know each other?

02:46.200 --> 02:49.272
I was at the Bureau when
Booth took his coffee cup.

02:49.360 --> 02:52.158
Apparently they're the
world's best FBI agents.

02:52.240 --> 02:57.155
He's on the Cugini case
- one of the originaI investigators. This is Brennan's brain trust.

02:57.240 --> 03:00.949
- Your victim is over here.
- What if your date's a psycho?

03:01.040 --> 03:03.838
- Only about a billion people date online.
- I have.

03:03.920 --> 03:08.550
Whatever happened to seeing someone
across a crowded room, eyes meeting,

03:08.640 --> 03:11.074
that old black magic
gets you in its spell?

03:11.160 --> 03:13.799
- There's no such thing as magic.
- There's magic.

03:13.880 --> 03:18.510
- Why are you here? Kenton's handling this.
- We have some remains to look at.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.433
<i>- I'm looking at them.
- Not the Cugini case.</i>

03:21.520 --> 03:24.114
Kenton will baby-sit
him. These are fresh.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.668
<i>I was told that this took precedence.</i>

03:26.760 --> 03:29.797
That was before we found
someone ripped apart by dogs.

03:31.520 --> 03:35.399
90% of flesh is missing
because of mutilation.

03:35.480 --> 03:39.712
And postmortem anthropophagi
caused by canine scavenging.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.358
Do they have to stay here?

03:41.440 --> 03:44.716
- We're waiting to see if you need them.
- No. Not now.

03:44.800 --> 03:48.998
- Ask him to save the excrement for Hodgins.
- Lucky Hodgins.

03:54.240 --> 03:56.595
- What about the eyes?
- Gone.

03:56.680 --> 03:58.796
- Gouged out?
- Yes.

03:58.880 --> 04:03.590
The scrapings in the orbitaI cavity is
much rougher than the knife scarring.

04:03.680 --> 04:07.798
- It was done with a different weapon.
- Son of a bitch.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.030
- You've seen this before?
- Yeah.

04:10.120 --> 04:13.237
Two years ago we found a
17-year-old girI in a tooI shed,

04:13.320 --> 04:15.959
bound, slashed, eyes gouged out.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.315
Nothing for her parents to identify.

04:18.399 --> 04:21.995
Suspect was Kevin Hollings, but
we couldn't get the hard evidence,

04:22.079 --> 04:24.310
so the DA refused to prosecute.

04:24.400 --> 04:27.312
He's twisted, Bones.

04:27.400 --> 04:30.756
- It's like a game to him.
- He used dogs before?

04:30.840 --> 04:34.230
No. He's making the killings
more elaborate. He's testing us.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.710
UntiI he gets caught. Isn't
that the expected pathology?

04:37.800 --> 04:39.028
Yeah.

04:39.120 --> 04:43.113
I can determine the kinds of weapons,
time of death. Hodgins might find...

04:47.680 --> 04:48.908
Brennan.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.560
Just working.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.476
Bag that.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.869
Yeah. Of course, I'm starving.

04:57.960 --> 05:00.474
7:30. OK. Yes.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.949
I'll meet you there. OK. Bye.

05:03.040 --> 05:06.510
My reservation just got pushed
so I have a few extra minutes.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.397
- Few extra minutes. Great.
- What?

05:08.480 --> 05:10.198
- Nothing.
- You disapprove?

05:10.280 --> 05:12.191
- I said "great".
- With attitude.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.794
Don't go overboard with the psychology.

05:14.880 --> 05:19.795
I am an adult, Booth. I see men. I go out
with them. On occasion, I sleep with them.

05:19.880 --> 05:22.553
You don't know who this
guy is that you're meeting.

05:22.640 --> 05:27.077
I trekked through Tibet avoiding the Chinese
army. I can handle meeting for dinner.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.948
Fine. You know what? You have fun
with Dick431 or whatever his handle is.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.679
- Yeah, I will. Thanks.
- Fine.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.716
Good.

05:39.520 --> 05:43.069
Victim is female,
late teens to mid-20s.

05:43.160 --> 05:46.072
Knife marks on the bone.
Evidence of deep cuts.

05:46.160 --> 05:50.153
Probably to open up
the flesh, make it...

05:50.800 --> 05:52.950
more appetising for the dogs.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.234
David. Hi.

06:02.560 --> 06:07.395
Yeah, I'm here. Well, I
guess I'm two doors down.

06:08.760 --> 06:13.311
No. I know. The traffic on
the beltway can be brutaI. OK.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.436
Bye.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.356
<i>Get down! Are you all right?</i>

06:58.640 --> 07:02.269
We need enlargements. Did
you examine the excrement?

07:02.360 --> 07:05.272
I'm doing the faecaI flotation.
I don't say that a lot.

07:05.360 --> 07:10.115
- Check for fibres the FBI might've missed...
- You've already told him... twice.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.156
Are you sure you don't want a drink?

07:12.240 --> 07:15.437
It wouldn't be difficult for
someone to encode a data strip,

07:15.520 --> 07:19.957
implant it in an ID card with the correct
authentication data, and sneak in here.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.998
- It is possible.
- Are you two going to help or not?

07:23.080 --> 07:27.119
Booth's pissed that you came here. He
had more questions for you at the scene.

07:27.200 --> 07:31.910
He doesn't want to come here because he has
to park in the structure. I need her face.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.959
- These bullet wounds haven't been cleaned.
- I worked on them for hours.

07:36.040 --> 07:39.157
Then that wasn't long enough, was it?

07:40.240 --> 07:42.754
I'm sorry. But...

07:44.360 --> 07:48.194
You take a sinus probe, you put a
little cotton swab on the end of it.

07:48.280 --> 07:52.910
You dip it in water and you dab it
inside the wound untiI it's clean.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.152
- The Sistine ChapeI took 13 years to clean.
- I didn't think we had that much time.

07:57.240 --> 08:01.199
<i>- What are you doing?
- Working. Why does everyone find that odd?</i>

08:01.280 --> 08:04.397
Because maybe an hour ago
someone tried to kill you.

08:04.480 --> 08:07.119
It's not a good idea for
you to work these cases.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.713
This is what I do.

08:08.800 --> 08:12.349
Whoever did this wants to make sure
you don't finish your investigation.

08:12.440 --> 08:16.911
Hundreds of criminals want me to stop what
I do. Are you suggesting I give up my career?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.833
- Just be reasonable.
- Fine.

08:19.920 --> 08:23.151
Logic suggests the shooter is
involved in one of these cases,

08:23.240 --> 08:25.595
so I should find out who killed them.

08:25.680 --> 08:29.753
- Did Forensics recover the bullets?
- Ballistics is running tests on them.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.433
Did you pick up the suspect
in the woman's murder?

08:32.520 --> 08:35.477
I don't want to spook him
untiI we have enough evidence.

08:35.559 --> 08:40.429
- Did you get a list of women missing age 18...
- 18 to 25, yes. They're on your server.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.433
- Everyone is doing theirjob.
- I'll see if any of them match the victim.

08:44.520 --> 08:48.593
What about the Romanos? Hodgins says
they were feuding with the Cuginis.

08:48.680 --> 08:52.673
Kenton is pulling the files on the
case and all mob activity six years ago.

08:52.760 --> 08:55.957
Bones, there is one other person
we have to look at. Your date.

08:56.040 --> 08:59.316
Well, I spoke with him, Booth.
He was in his car in traffic.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.595
And why would he want to kill me?

09:01.680 --> 09:04.752
Why would somebody want to
kill your victim over there?

09:04.840 --> 09:09.470
I know it's hard to admit that you might be
wrong, but I don't care about your feelings.

09:09.560 --> 09:12.632
I'm concerned with your life.
They're bringing your date in.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.392
- Grab your coat.
- I'm working.

09:14.480 --> 09:21.033
Bones, I'm not letting you out of my sight
untiI I find out who is trying to kill you.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.117
- Temperance.
- David.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.350
- Someone shot at you.
- Yeah.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.431
Oh, my God. What can I do?

09:30.520 --> 09:34.638
I'm SpeciaI Agent Seeley Booth. I'll
be asking the questions. Sit down.

09:34.720 --> 09:39.430
Sure. I didn't see anything. I saw all the
cops, but I had no idea it had to do with you.

09:39.520 --> 09:43.229
You're an investment banker,
good-looking, but you find women online.

09:43.320 --> 09:45.595
- Excuse me?
- Don't you find women at work?

09:45.680 --> 09:48.194
She was online. She's
a great-looking doctor.

09:48.280 --> 09:53.308
- Your picture doesn't do you justice.
- Well, thank you. Yours either. I...

09:53.400 --> 09:57.029
- The resolution mustn't be very good online.
- Bones.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.997
- Oh, he's a Luddite.
- Hey.

09:59.080 --> 10:02.675
- Someone who's afraid of technology.
- I know what a Luddite is.

10:02.760 --> 10:05.399
So, you're saying that
you were stuck in traffic?

10:05.480 --> 10:08.074
What, you think I shot at her?

10:08.160 --> 10:11.994
I'm a fundraiser for the Brady
Campaign against gun violence.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.992
- Do you think I tried to kill you?
- He has to do this.

10:15.080 --> 10:18.197
- Yeah. So what time did you leave work?
- About 6:45.

10:18.280 --> 10:22.273
- Any witnesses?
- My assistant, the client that I was with.

10:22.360 --> 10:25.477
The valet at the parking
garage. Unless they're suspects.

10:25.560 --> 10:28.552
- We'll talk to everyone.
- Did you see the traffic report?

10:28.640 --> 10:30.710
He did.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.511
You did.

10:36.240 --> 10:41.314
- Do I have to get an attorney?
- Just stay close in case we need you.

10:41.400 --> 10:45.552
Yeah, sure. I mean,
anything I can do to help.

10:46.240 --> 10:49.198
So, this whole online
thing, how long does it last?

10:49.280 --> 10:53.353
<i>Because if it's just a way to...
hook up, I think it's pretty low.</i>

10:53.440 --> 10:56.398
- My partner met his wife online.
- You're kidding.

10:56.480 --> 11:00.109
- No. They've been married five years.
- Doesn't mean it's not creepy.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.909
Did I miss something? I don't want
to get in the way between you...

11:04.000 --> 11:07.390
- Oh, no.
- No. God.

11:07.480 --> 11:09.516
- Maybe we could reschedule dinner.
- No.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.989
- Sure.
- Great.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.674
- Someone needs this room. Let's go.
- Yeah, sure.

11:14.760 --> 11:18.389
- Well, I'll emaiI you. Stay safe.
- She will stay safe.

11:20.320 --> 11:23.357
- He's nice, don't you think?
- Yeah, he's nice...

11:23.440 --> 11:25.078
as a suspect. What?

11:25.160 --> 11:27.196
Hello?

11:32.920 --> 11:34.751
The victim is Penny Hamilton,

11:34.840 --> 11:39.277
19, a student at American who
disappeared walking back to her dorm.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.635
She was going to Haiti
to work in a clinic.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.359
- Booth will think this is his fault.
- He knew her?

11:44.440 --> 11:48.672
The killer has done this before. Booth
couldn't get the evidence he needed.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.672
The guy promised Booth he never would.

11:51.760 --> 11:56.151
Where is Booth, anyway? I thought he
wasn't gonna let you out of his sight.

11:56.240 --> 12:02.190
I gave him the positive ID on
Cugini. He's calling it in to Kenton.

12:02.280 --> 12:06.751
So how do you like David? It's not often
you can interrogate a guy on a first date.

12:06.840 --> 12:12.073
I like him. Booth still doesn't approve,
but I told him to mind his own business.

12:12.160 --> 12:16.438
Booth is a big, strong, hot
guy who wants to save your life.

12:16.520 --> 12:21.958
You actually have a knight in shining
FBI body armour. So cut him some slack.

12:22.040 --> 12:25.749
Kenton heard the Romanos are pissed.
When they get pissed, they shoot.

12:25.840 --> 12:29.833
I have cleaned the bones, Dr
Brennan. You could eat off them.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.992
Is this her?

12:33.080 --> 12:35.514
Yeah.

12:44.920 --> 12:50.711
Nice work. You can see the markings left
on the bone where the bullet passed through.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.268
- I can?
- Yes.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.510
Here and here on the outer compact bone.

12:55.600 --> 13:00.754
- Could you recreate the complete imprint?
- I don't know if I have enough to work with.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.115
- What are you getting at?
- After discharge,

13:03.200 --> 13:06.954
every bullet has a distinct pattern
etched into it from the barreI.

13:07.040 --> 13:11.113
That same pattern would be etched
into the bone as it passes through.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.431
If we get the pattern, we can
reverse-engineer the bullet.

13:14.520 --> 13:17.239
Then you'd be able to
tell which weapon was used.

13:17.320 --> 13:20.312
- I have never heard of that.
- It's a theory I'm working on.

13:20.400 --> 13:24.632
- This would be a good time to test it.
- Great. Anything more about the girI?

13:24.720 --> 13:30.158
The knife marks were made by a nonserrated
blade consistent with a pocketknife like this.

13:30.240 --> 13:35.872
I found additionaI knife marks on C5,
indicating that the throat was slashed.

13:35.960 --> 13:39.555
- What about her eyes?
- The grooving doesn't match the knife.

13:39.640 --> 13:42.154
And Hodgins is playing with dog poop.

13:42.240 --> 13:46.472
Let's go. Kenton is putting together
everything on Cugini's disappearance.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.710
I'm probably more valuable here.

13:48.800 --> 13:52.679
No. You're more valuable alive.
I'm not leaving you alone. Come on.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.115
If it's so dangerous,
why are you leaving us?

13:55.200 --> 14:00.320
Big strong guy like you, huh? You'd
be able to take care of yourself.

14:01.960 --> 14:04.155
<i>I worked with the Romanos.</i>

14:04.240 --> 14:08.119
I never got very high in the organisation.
I left when my cover was blown.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.237
- You think one of the Romanos did this?
- It had to be.

14:11.320 --> 14:15.233
Hard to tell who. They use a lot of
different guys for ajob like this.

14:15.320 --> 14:18.551
That's Frank Lombardi.
He's been seen in the area.

14:18.640 --> 14:24.476
Suspected of killing over 25 people. Shooting
mostly, but he likes the occasionaI garrotting.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.915
Think they'd try to do
away with the doctor?

14:27.000 --> 14:31.073
They're trying to look legit. They
don't want ancient history resurfacing.

14:31.160 --> 14:34.755
- Bad for business.
- But you don't know it's them.

14:34.840 --> 14:38.549
I have sources. They tell me the
Romanos know you're working this case.

14:38.640 --> 14:42.997
And they know you're the best.
I recommend you walk away.

14:43.080 --> 14:46.356
Is that why you brought me
here? To scare me into giving up?

14:46.440 --> 14:49.000
I want you to get reaI. These people...

14:49.080 --> 14:51.640
We don't know who it is. It
could be them or Hollings.

14:51.720 --> 14:57.590
No. SeriaI killers, they follow a pattern. They
don't torture, then pick people off with a rifle.

14:57.680 --> 15:02.117
Hollings promised no one would find
enough to get him. Maybe he knows I can.

15:02.200 --> 15:05.078
- Too dangerous.
- You almost got a bullet in the skull.

15:05.160 --> 15:09.551
I can give you answers, Booth.
I can help you get Hollings.

15:09.640 --> 15:13.838
You really want me to walk
away because it's dangerous?

15:13.920 --> 15:16.718
Sorry, man. I tried.

15:18.600 --> 15:21.433
Any word from Ballistics
on the bullets meant for me?

15:21.520 --> 15:24.830
<i>It was a military issue. Colt AR-15.</i>

15:24.920 --> 15:25.909
Brennan.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.197
<i>Fasciola hepatica. It's a
parasite found in beef liver.</i>

15:29.280 --> 15:32.909
Their eggs are in the excrement.
The dogs were strays and starving.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.755
Someone lured them with liver scraps. There
was no evidence of liver found at the scene.

15:37.840 --> 15:42.630
So if we find any traces of liver at
Hollings' place that contains the parasite,

15:42.720 --> 15:45.109
- we can tie him to the dogs.
- It's possible.

15:45.200 --> 15:49.398
I found that the cut marks on her bone
showed that there was a nick in the blade.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.869
OK. Thanks.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.592
Agent Booth?

16:01.680 --> 16:03.910
- Long time no see.
- Hollings.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.151
- Could we take a look around?
- Do you have a warrant?

16:07.240 --> 16:10.915
No. But you enjoy being
cooperative, if I remember.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.231
Come in, please.

16:14.320 --> 16:16.788
You must be Dr Brennan.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.599
I read about the
incident the other night.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.353
- You must've had a fright.
- Don't play with her.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.750
I hope you don't think
I was being insensitive.

16:26.840 --> 16:29.593
Tell me what you're looking
for and I could help.

16:29.680 --> 16:32.114
We just want to look around, that's all.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.316
Be my guest.

16:35.720 --> 16:38.518
- Could I open this?
- Of course.

16:44.440 --> 16:47.796
Is this about the girI
they found the other night?

16:47.880 --> 16:50.314
Terrible thing.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.437
You don't think I'm involved
in this one too, do you?

16:53.520 --> 16:56.353
Blades are clean. No nicks.

16:56.440 --> 17:01.594
I guarantee that whatever you're
looking for, you're not gonna find here.

17:02.600 --> 17:05.397
What we need might be
locked up someplace.

17:05.480 --> 17:07.914
Wow. There are thousands of keys here.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.230
Tens of thousands.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.753
Maybe we'll just take
them down to the Bureau.

17:12.839 --> 17:16.515
That's a private collection.
Without cause or a warrant...

17:16.599 --> 17:21.753
I do have cause. This key here is from a
federaI building. It says "do not duplicate".

17:21.839 --> 17:25.195
And this one looks like it was used
in a burglary around the corner.

17:25.280 --> 17:29.512
- Oh, since you did allow us in your home...
- This is very rude, Agent Booth.

17:29.600 --> 17:33.275
- I open my home to you, then...
- We should photograph everything.

17:33.360 --> 17:36.796
How he's arranged the items in
the room could be very important.

17:36.880 --> 17:43.069
- I'd like to call my attorney.
- The game's not so fun now, is it, Hollings?

17:48.360 --> 17:51.909
I have a court date tomorrow.
You had no right to take his keys.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.878
There were burglaries. Those
keys could give answers.

17:54.960 --> 17:59.829
- My client can't be tied to those burglaries.
- You're probably right, but I have ajob to do.

17:59.920 --> 18:03.435
Mr Hollings has always been so
understanding of that in the past.

18:03.520 --> 18:08.594
Oh, I... I do understand. I've given you
a statement, explained where I got the keys.

18:08.680 --> 18:11.399
- And since you haven't charged him...
- Yet.

18:11.480 --> 18:17.669
But I'm really looking forward to
charging him with this. Look at that. Wow.

18:24.680 --> 18:29.549
I imagine it must be very frustrating
when you... when you can't solve a crime.

18:29.640 --> 18:32.916
My client is a respected
researcher with Whitley ChemicaI.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.596
He hasn't missed a day of work in the
past two weeks. Unless you have evidence...

18:37.680 --> 18:40.752
Can't stop looking at
it, can you, Hollings?

18:40.840 --> 18:42.956
What does it do to you?

18:43.040 --> 18:45.395
Does it make you hot?

18:48.960 --> 18:52.396
- Is that the psycho?
- He's brilliant.

18:52.480 --> 18:58.112
He knew we were looking for a pocketknife
so he left one in plain sight. The wrong one.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.998
If you don't find anything
concrete, he walks again?

19:01.080 --> 19:05.631
I don't know if Booth could live with
that. Those keys have to lead somewhere.

19:05.720 --> 19:10.350
The files we had on the suspects. People we
knew worked for the Romanos six years ago.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.432
PhysicaI descriptions, blood
types, everything we had.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.875
Might help if you
find any more evidence.

19:15.960 --> 19:20.750
Thanks. After we recreate the bullet, we can
track the angle of entry based on height...

19:20.840 --> 19:24.276
I don't get it. You don't have
the physicaI round that was shot.

19:24.360 --> 19:28.911
I'm trying to make one based on the
wounds. Could give us the murder weapon.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.309
- Sweet.
- If it works.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.068
Let me know if there's
anything else I can do.

19:35.160 --> 19:37.879
<i>- Sure.
- I can and I will.</i>

19:37.960 --> 19:39.678
<i>You're fishing.</i>

19:39.760 --> 19:44.470
No judge will let you keep that collection,
Agent Booth. You have to know that.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.994
We'll have it back by tomorrow.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.435
<i>Nice try.</i>

19:54.160 --> 19:59.029
I got the keys, but the judge will release
them in 18 hours unless we find something.

19:59.120 --> 20:02.317
- Bones thought maybe you could help.
- I'm an archaeologist.

20:02.400 --> 20:06.632
She thought you could look at it as though
it were some kind of historicaI site.

20:06.720 --> 20:11.316
That's a reasonable assumption. A person's
environment is a reflection of who he is.

20:11.400 --> 20:15.996
He's a predator, very smart, enjoys the game.
You know, he feels like he's untouchable.

20:16.080 --> 20:18.116
The room is centred around this chair.

20:18.200 --> 20:21.909
You can see how he's surrounded back
and sides by the bulk of the keys.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.949
If this were an innocent collection,
he'd be facing it, but he's displaying it.

20:27.040 --> 20:29.508
A guy like this, you
know, his kills are prizes.

20:29.600 --> 20:35.550
The Bureau's searching to match one to a
locker or apartment, but there's too many.

20:35.640 --> 20:39.599
Mayan rulers kept souvenirs of
kills. They called it a "tzompantli".

20:39.680 --> 20:43.559
It was believed that it would
strike fear into anyone who saw it.

20:43.640 --> 20:45.073
- He's a loner.
- Yes.

20:45.160 --> 20:49.312
But this gave him enough power and
security that he let you into his home.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.755
- He's right-handed,
correct? - Yeah.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.798
Well, the bulk of the
keys are on his right side.

20:54.880 --> 20:58.509
Those of the greatest value
to him would be in reach.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.989
They hold his power.

21:01.080 --> 21:04.959
I would look at any of the keys in the
containers on his right side over here.

21:07.080 --> 21:11.232
I thought it could be a saw blade of some
kind. I compared the damage with these.

21:11.320 --> 21:17.077
The crenulations form a pattern. They don't
match what we see in the orbitaI cavities.

21:17.160 --> 21:19.310
What if she were struggling?

21:19.400 --> 21:23.712
Lack of haemorrhage in the tissue suggests
she was dead before the eyes were removed.

21:23.800 --> 21:26.872
We need to find something
smaller, a surgicaI instrument.

21:26.960 --> 21:31.476
The concrete used to sink Cugini contains
fly ash instead of Portland cement.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.710
- It's very exciting.
- Not yet.

21:33.800 --> 21:37.429
Each company has its own mixture.
Building codes have to be met.

21:37.520 --> 21:43.117
After that, it's up to each company. These
people used fly ash, which is much cheaper.

21:43.200 --> 21:47.637
Tapford Construction. Six years
ago it was owned by Carlo Romano.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.870
<i>Romano doesn't seem worried.</i>

21:49.960 --> 21:51.951
<i>- Hubris.
- Good word.</i>

21:52.040 --> 21:54.998
<i>Thanks. He won't be smug
after we talk to him.</i>

21:55.080 --> 21:58.959
I'm running the names of employees
from his company six years ago,

21:59.040 --> 22:01.918
pulling sales invoices. Gonna
be a lot to sort through.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.391
Hodgins is seeing if there's any skin or
fingernaiI in the concrete to pull DNA from.

22:06.480 --> 22:10.678
<i>That's another remote possibility.</i>

22:11.760 --> 22:14.274
Booth.

22:14.360 --> 22:18.876
Yeah. Judge ordered the release of
Hollings' possessions. We can't hold him.

22:18.960 --> 22:24.034
- How many have they been through?
- The lab had to match seriaI numbers,

22:24.120 --> 22:26.475
compare the crenulations.

22:26.560 --> 22:29.996
- The crenulations.
- They haven't been through the first 500...

22:30.080 --> 22:31.354
There is no lock.

22:31.440 --> 22:34.159
- Those keys don't open anything.
- What?

22:34.240 --> 22:38.711
The crenulations, the grooves carved
into the bone around the victim's eyes,

22:38.800 --> 22:43.112
they were irregular, like...
like the grooves of a key.

22:43.200 --> 22:47.318
- Bones, how many keys do you need?
- Well, car, house, lab, morgue.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.437
<i>- I need a lot of keys.
- Grooves?</i>

22:50.520 --> 22:54.832
He must've used a key to gouge out the eyes.
And he kept it near him in his apartment.

22:54.920 --> 22:58.629
That was his souvenir. How much
longer can you keep the keys?

22:58.720 --> 23:02.508
- He's on his way to reclaim them now.
- So you have at least a half an hour?

23:02.600 --> 23:03.919
At least.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.471
Tell Forensics to forget about matching
them to any locks. Have them image each key.

23:08.560 --> 23:12.599
Send them to Zack so he can find a key
that matches the grooves on the bone.

23:12.680 --> 23:15.797
- That shouldn't take long.
- Image key, send to Zack.

23:15.880 --> 23:19.236
- She's good, huh?
- Told you.

23:19.920 --> 23:23.230
Romano didn't give us anything,
so I should be back at the lab.

23:23.320 --> 23:28.440
Your squints can handle it. You haven't
slept. Get some rest. I'll sleep on the couch.

23:28.520 --> 23:32.593
- You think you're staying here with me?
- Yeah. Nice place, by the way, Bones.

23:32.680 --> 23:35.399
No. I'm... I'm locked in
here, Booth. I'll be fine.

23:35.480 --> 23:40.315
Stay away from your windows. A sniper has
a clear shot from any of these buildings.

23:40.400 --> 23:43.358
I could've stayed at the
lab. Security's tight there.

23:43.440 --> 23:47.274
Then you would've worked, gotten
tired, and been more vulnerable.

23:47.360 --> 23:49.590
Trust me, this is the best, all right?

23:49.680 --> 23:51.955
So...

23:52.040 --> 23:56.556
- Where's the TV?
- I had one, but it broke. I...

23:56.640 --> 24:00.997
I mostly just read and listen to music.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.915
So let's listen to some music, huh?

24:06.040 --> 24:08.600
Music. What have we got? Bones.

24:08.680 --> 24:12.150
Wow, world music. There's a shock.

24:13.240 --> 24:17.756
- "Tibetan Throat Singers. " Rock on, Bones.
- That's mostly for work...

24:17.840 --> 24:21.594
Kanye West, Cat Power...
Oh, oh. All right.

24:21.680 --> 24:27.312
Look at this. There's lots ofjazz. I think
that free-form stuff would be too unpredictable.

24:27.400 --> 24:32.838
No. I love it. The artist has to live within a
set tonaI structure and trust his own instincts

24:32.920 --> 24:36.799
to find his way out of an infinite
maze of musicaI possibilities,

24:36.880 --> 24:39.030
and the great ones do.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.590
- What?
- Oh, nothing. I just...

24:43.680 --> 24:47.070
I just never expected
that you would, you know...

24:47.160 --> 24:48.991
That I would love music?

24:49.080 --> 24:53.039
Well, I don't usually get to talk
about it, but since you brought it up...

24:53.120 --> 24:57.591
No, hey. No, I didn't mean to make
you self-conscious. Whoa, what's this?

24:57.680 --> 24:58.749
- What is it?
- Nice.

24:58.840 --> 25:00.398
Booth...

25:04.800 --> 25:07.678
- How did that get there?
- Everybody loves Foreigner.

25:07.760 --> 25:11.150
"Hot Blooded. " Talk
about a guilty pleasure.

25:38.240 --> 25:40.231
Brennan.

25:40.320 --> 25:44.154
David, hi. I'm fine, thanks.

25:44.240 --> 25:49.598
Booth, yeah. I'm still under
lockdown untiI we solve these crimes.

25:49.680 --> 25:53.070
Yes. Foreigner.

25:53.160 --> 25:56.357
OK, I'II... OK, sure.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

25:56.440 --> 25:59.318
OK, thanks for calling. Bye.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.155
- I hope he didn't think...
- No.

26:04.240 --> 26:08.552
Because I wouldn't want to, you
know, ruin things for you or...

26:08.640 --> 26:11.029
Not a problem.

26:13.800 --> 26:17.429
Hey, you got a soda? Some juice?

26:17.520 --> 26:20.193
- Yeah. In my fridge. I'll get it.
- No, no, no, no.

26:20.280 --> 26:24.273
You know what? I'm not your guest. You
don't have to wait on me. I'll get it.

26:24.360 --> 26:28.876
- Do you want anything?
- That's OK.

26:28.960 --> 26:33.431
Oh, there's glasses in the
cupboard to the right of the fridge.

26:55.040 --> 26:58.555
<i>- Kenton's on his way. Stay with him.
- I will.</i>

26:58.640 --> 27:01.473
- Did they gather all the evidence?
- Yes.

27:01.560 --> 27:04.711
- You're sure?
- Yes. Booth, I was there.

27:04.800 --> 27:08.190
They were very thorough
and I was very annoying.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.037
I'm sorry, Booth. It should
be me Iying in that bed.

27:13.120 --> 27:17.910
I'm fine, you know. I don't even
know if I have to stay here, you know?

27:18.000 --> 27:20.309
- You got blown up.
- I've been worse.

27:20.400 --> 27:26.077
You have burns, lacerations, two broken
ribs, greenstick fracture of the clavicle.

27:26.160 --> 27:29.072
OK, I got blown up.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.953
Can you hand me one of the puddings?

27:40.760 --> 27:42.716
Oh, man.

27:43.800 --> 27:46.633
Thanks, Bones. Look at that.

27:46.720 --> 27:48.517
Oh.

27:50.280 --> 27:53.829
You know, on your x-rays,

27:53.920 --> 27:59.278
there's a history of multiple fractures
on your feet consistent with beating.

27:59.360 --> 28:03.399
It's a common method of
torture in the Middle East,

28:03.480 --> 28:08.474
beating the soles of the
feet with pipes or... hoses.

28:08.560 --> 28:10.551
Yeah, I know.

28:10.640 --> 28:16.317
And there are indications of injuries
sustained while you were shielding someone.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.072
How the hell can you tell that?

28:18.160 --> 28:22.517
The scarring shows that the
ribcage spread in such a way that...

28:22.600 --> 28:24.477
Yeah.

28:24.560 --> 28:27.279
OK.

28:27.360 --> 28:29.954
A buddy of mine...

28:31.240 --> 28:33.595
he lost his weapon and I...

28:36.320 --> 28:38.311
I tried.

28:43.040 --> 28:45.110
He didn't make it.

28:48.440 --> 28:52.149
You know, you shouldn't
be looking at my x-rays.

28:53.200 --> 28:55.395
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

28:55.480 --> 28:56.754
- Hey.
- Yeah.

28:56.840 --> 28:58.910
You look like crap.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.595
A little bit more pudding and
I'll be just fine. Stick with her.

29:02.680 --> 29:06.116
- If you want me to.
- Don't you think I should be consulted?

29:06.200 --> 29:10.273
<i>- No. Keep her close.
- Don't worry.</i>

29:10.360 --> 29:13.079
<i>- Could've been you.
- Y es, I know.</i>

29:13.160 --> 29:18.154
- He survived cos he reached for the glass.
- I know. Can we change the subject?

29:18.240 --> 29:20.515
Let's talk revenge... blood lust.

29:20.600 --> 29:24.957
The release we want can only be
achieved when we gather enough evidence

29:25.040 --> 29:29.192
to neutralise the person responsible
for putting Booth in hospitaI.

29:29.280 --> 29:33.319
- Neutralise can mean either "kill" or "arrest".
- Yes. It can mean either.

29:33.400 --> 29:35.630
What exactly are you doing?

29:35.720 --> 29:39.395
I'm using a program to fill in the
missing markings made by the bullet

29:39.480 --> 29:41.436
when it passed through the bone.

29:41.520 --> 29:44.796
Impressed? I have so many more tricks.

29:44.880 --> 29:48.429
There's no ring. Single or gay?

29:48.520 --> 29:51.080
Gay... Why would you say gay?

29:51.160 --> 29:53.469
<i>Brokeback, baby. Gotta ask.</i>

29:53.560 --> 29:55.391
- Not gay.
- Angela.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.391
We'll talk later.

29:57.480 --> 30:02.679
So you'd match a digitaI replica of the
bullet with any recovered bullets the FBI has?

30:02.760 --> 30:08.232
- Yes. To cross-reference
crimes, suspects... - Amazing.

30:08.320 --> 30:12.598
I just finished with Forensics analysing
the composition of the explosives.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.830
The isotopes and sulphur match.

30:14.920 --> 30:19.630
It is a perfect match to the sulphur
made by the company Hollings works for.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.396
- FBI!
- Go! Go!

30:22.480 --> 30:25.074
Show yourself!

30:25.160 --> 30:26.957
Clear!

30:40.080 --> 30:42.275
He took off.

30:43.840 --> 30:47.549
He marked the same part of town
where we found the other victim.

30:47.640 --> 30:50.598
He's going after someone
else. I want all this bagged.

30:50.680 --> 30:53.990
<i>Let's go. Don't disturb anything.</i>

30:54.080 --> 30:55.832
- Brennan.
- We found the key.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.673
FBI said Hollings never
returned to claim them.

30:58.760 --> 31:00.830
It matches the bone damage exactly.

31:00.920 --> 31:02.990
<i>- And it's one of Hollings' keys?
- Y es.</i>

31:03.080 --> 31:08.074
Hodgins tried to retrieve DNA, but he says
it was dipped in some kind of chemicaI bath.

31:08.160 --> 31:11.470
- Good work.
- Maybe you should come in now.

31:11.560 --> 31:14.950
<i>I'll be fine, Zack. Any
luck with the bullet?</i>

31:15.040 --> 31:18.828
You want to go back to the lab untiI
we get any news? It'll be safer.

31:18.920 --> 31:21.036
<i>I'll see you in a few minutes.</i>

31:21.360 --> 31:23.271
<i>He's got the ball again...</i>

31:27.840 --> 31:28.875
Hey.

31:28.960 --> 31:32.032
- Is Brennan all right?
- Sure. She's with your compadre.

31:32.120 --> 31:34.873
I just came by to see how you are.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.678
Oh.

31:36.760 --> 31:40.912
Pudding. I still remember this stuff
from when I got my appendix out.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.595
Yeah. And it's as good as you remember.

31:44.680 --> 31:46.511
- Key fit?
- Yeah.

31:46.600 --> 31:50.070
They found a map of where the
other body was found, and more keys.

31:50.160 --> 31:54.278
On a map? We didn't... we
didn't catch that before?

31:54.360 --> 31:58.069
- I guess not. Or your killer's getting sloppy.
- That's not like him.

31:58.160 --> 32:03.234
It wasn't like him to use explosives. People
change. That's the wonderfuI thing about life.

32:03.320 --> 32:08.872
Now we can get him before he
gets Brennan. Can I have this one?

32:08.960 --> 32:10.951
- You OK?
- Huh?

32:11.040 --> 32:12.439
Yeah. Yeah.

32:12.520 --> 32:16.957
I'm just thinking. People don't change.
We like to believe they do, but they don't.

32:17.040 --> 32:18.996
You thinking it's the mob guys?

32:19.080 --> 32:23.153
I'm just thinking that
things... they don't make sense.

32:23.240 --> 32:27.597
You're feeling something a little more
devious. More like a frame-up? I like it.

32:27.680 --> 32:30.399
- Very conspiratoriaI.
- Things are just too neat.

32:30.480 --> 32:33.711
- Hollings would never leave a map there.
- Go with me on this.

32:33.800 --> 32:37.349
Mob guys know you're closing in and
want to make it look like the psycho.

32:37.440 --> 32:40.557
They've been involved in
more complicated conspiracies.

32:40.640 --> 32:44.713
They set up Lee Harvey Oswald,
worked with the CIA to kill Castro.

32:44.800 --> 32:48.918
Someone planted that evidence.
Someone who knew what we were up to.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.514
Someone at the lab works for the Mob.

32:51.600 --> 32:56.674
I can see it. No difference between a corrupt
corporate government and organised crime.

32:56.760 --> 32:59.479
- You're right.
- Excuse me?

32:59.560 --> 33:05.351
The only way this could unfold is if someone
on the inside was orchestrating things.

33:05.440 --> 33:10.309
People never tell me I'm right. They
only say I'm crazy. Love you, man.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.834
- What the hell are you doing?
- You're driving.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.592
- CooI.
- OK.

33:14.680 --> 33:18.798
Yeah. OK. Make sure there's backup.

33:18.880 --> 33:23.032
Someone took a woman into those
abandoned buildings off Hunter Boulevard.

33:23.120 --> 33:26.476
- I'll drop you off at the lab.
- No. I'm coming.

33:27.560 --> 33:31.917
- Booth said it was pointless to argue.
- He's a smart man, Booth. I'll call Zack.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.150
I know how to complete the bullet.

33:34.240 --> 33:39.268
Even if we only have one side, if we can
approximate the spin as it was fired...

33:44.400 --> 33:47.517
You really are the best.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.591
It's too bad.

33:54.960 --> 33:59.192
<i>You work for the FBI and they put
you on hold when you want information.</i>

33:59.280 --> 34:04.479
Kenton was working Organised Crime at the
same time that Cugini was killed. Right?

34:04.560 --> 34:08.268
He was the only one who knew the
details on both investigations.

34:08.360 --> 34:12.194
He takes what he knows about Hollings
to throw suspicions off himself.

34:13.760 --> 34:17.196
Maybe that nurse was right to
be pissed that you were leaving.

34:17.280 --> 34:20.511
If we weren't in a toy car... Yeah?

34:20.600 --> 34:24.195
Listen to me, Bobby. Just get
some units out there now. OK?

34:24.280 --> 34:28.876
I want to know about any activity in
the abandoned buildings on that map.

34:28.960 --> 34:35.433
- Brennan's not picking up her cell.
- Kenton never called for backup or anything.

34:35.520 --> 34:39.353
Jeez. How could I be so stupid?
I mean, everything pointed to him.

34:39.440 --> 34:42.193
- It is not your fault.
- How could it not be my fault?

34:42.280 --> 34:48.116
It was my job to protect her.
Instead, I hand her over to him.

34:49.760 --> 34:52.034
Certain crimes you just gotta let slide.

34:52.120 --> 34:56.272
A death like Cugini's is an internaI
issue. It doesn't affect anyone else.

34:56.360 --> 35:00.035
- You killed Cugini?
- You don't get rich working for the FBI.

35:00.120 --> 35:02.759
When I was undercover, the
Romanos were good to me.

35:02.840 --> 35:06.549
When you accept their generosity,
you have to do what they ask.

35:06.640 --> 35:09.234
Is that how you live with yourself?

35:09.320 --> 35:13.359
It's no different to Booth taking out
someone from the other side in the Gulf.

35:13.440 --> 35:16.193
That was a war. His actions saved lives.

35:16.280 --> 35:21.115
You don't think getting rid
of Cugini ended a street war?

35:21.200 --> 35:24.033
So my death will be justified now?

35:24.120 --> 35:26.509
Bureau keeps a shell from every weapon.

35:26.600 --> 35:31.720
You match it, it points to my weapon and I
go down. The Romanos make sure I don't talk.

35:31.800 --> 35:34.917
Well, at least I'm
dying for a good reason.

36:04.480 --> 36:06.948
<i>Maybe you're wrong. Hollings is missing.</i>

36:07.040 --> 36:12.797
Convenient. Kenton planted the lead so
we'd go after Hollings, who we'd never find.

36:12.880 --> 36:15.314
- Because he's dead?
- Because he's dead.

36:15.400 --> 36:20.520
This whole conspiracy thing is a lot more
intense when you're in the middle of it.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.989
Yeah. OK.

36:23.080 --> 36:27.710
Look, an agent talked to a witness who saw a
couple go into a building off of North 23rd.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.711
"A building"? That's specific.

36:29.800 --> 36:33.315
Crackheads aren't that
detaiI-oriented. Step on it. Come on.

36:38.960 --> 36:41.599
They're not gonna find Hollings. Uh-uh.

36:46.360 --> 36:50.751
You know, he used to slit their
throat like they were cattle.

36:50.840 --> 36:54.355
Told me he used the key to
unlock the souI behind their eyes.

36:54.440 --> 36:58.911
That is one sick bastard
the world ain't gonna miss.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.713
We used thermaI imagery to
see inside the buildings.

37:06.800 --> 37:09.519
Found a crackhouse. Just
about to move in here next.

37:09.600 --> 37:12.876
He hears, he could freak out and
kill her. We gotta be carefuI.

37:12.960 --> 37:14.632
- There's no "we".
- I'm going in.

37:14.720 --> 37:19.510
- You can barely stand.
- I said I'm going in. Give me my gun.

37:21.960 --> 37:24.349
Bring me that vest for Booth.

37:24.440 --> 37:26.317
- Wear this.
- Yeah.

37:29.840 --> 37:32.559
You know what? You can
come too. Put that on.

37:32.640 --> 37:35.154
- You stay back.
- I can do that.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.118
I'm sorry.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.714
I really am.

38:21.320 --> 38:24.790
Maybe you shouldn't have
had all that pudding.

38:47.120 --> 38:52.752
I'm not like him, though. The things I
have to do to you, you'll be gone first.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.477
You'll never know a thing.

38:55.560 --> 38:58.393
I never expected anyone to find out.

39:07.080 --> 39:10.038
All right. OK. All right.

39:19.200 --> 39:22.636
Oh, it's OK. I'm right
here. It's all over.

39:23.720 --> 39:25.312
All right. OK.

39:25.400 --> 39:27.994
Shh. I'm right here. All right.

39:28.080 --> 39:30.753
It's all over. Shh. All right.

39:30.840 --> 39:33.957
- How did you get out of the hospitaI?
- I...

39:34.040 --> 39:39.672
Hodgins gave me a ride. Maybe you
can give me a ride back, huh? Can you?

39:41.760 --> 39:43.557
<i>OK.</i>

39:44.680 --> 39:49.708
Kenton is telling us everything. I guess
there's nothing to hide. He's finished anyway.

39:49.800 --> 39:54.078
- Better late than never, huh?
- Yeah, I guess.

39:54.160 --> 39:56.799
You know, I... I let you down, Bones.

39:56.880 --> 39:59.599
I'm... sorry.

39:59.680 --> 40:02.911
- You saved my life.
- Yeah. But, you know, it shouldn't...

40:03.000 --> 40:05.878
it shouldn't have gone down like that.

40:08.880 --> 40:11.997
<i>What a pair.</i>

40:12.840 --> 40:14.512
Brennan.

40:15.600 --> 40:18.068
I'm leaving right now.

40:20.600 --> 40:22.272
David.

40:22.360 --> 40:28.879
- We're finally having our dinner.
- I figured you didn't dress up for me.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.758
- You sure you don't want anything?
- I'll be fine.

40:31.840 --> 40:35.594
I'm just gonna, you know,
flip around the TV here.

40:39.560 --> 40:41.630
OK.

40:41.720 --> 40:44.518
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah. Have a good night.

40:44.600 --> 40:47.114
Thanks.

40:48.800 --> 40:51.758
<i>- Dow averages...
- Pancakes...</i>

41:03.600 --> 41:07.957
<i>We'll finish a delightful evening
with reintegrated champagne.</i>

41:08.040 --> 41:10.713
I rescheduled.

41:10.800 --> 41:13.473
My... my head still hurts.

41:17.760 --> 41:21.548
- You can watch TV if you like.
- Sure.

41:27.880 --> 41:30.235
Bones. Arm.

41:30.320 --> 41:31.753
Thanks.

41:38.080 --> 41:42.631

up a guy, I'll be there.</i>
