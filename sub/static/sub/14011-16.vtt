<i> Joe Pilefsky, a soldier</i>

00:25.493 --> 00:27.192
<i> Hired muscle.</i>

00:27.194 --> 00:29.361
So maybe
I roughed up the Russian.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.464
<i> Mario Zalta, a capo</i>
<i> in the Masucci family.</i>

00:32.466 --> 00:36.035
<i> Currently running</i>
<i> an untaxed cigarette scam.</i>

00:36.037 --> 00:38.037
This is New York.

00:38.039 --> 00:40.056
Go figure.

00:40.057 --> 00:42.074
<i> Harv Beigel,</i>
<i> the Don's brother-in-law.</i>

00:42.076 --> 00:44.376
<i> The cigarettes</i>
<i> go through his warehouse.</i>

00:44.378 --> 00:47.312
Look, you guys want to get
something on Frank Masucci,

00:47.314 --> 00:48.547
you got the wrong guy.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.215
I'm in real estate, period.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.217
<i> Frank Masucci-- the Don.</i>

00:52.219 --> 00:55.454
<i> Head of the largest</i>
<i> crime family in New York.</i>

00:55.456 --> 00:58.424
Hey, as far as I know, Harvey's
in the real estate business,

00:58.426 --> 01:00.259
although you never can tell
about in-laws.

01:00.261 --> 01:03.395
<i> These four men</i>
<i> conspired to set up Stone.</i>

01:03.397 --> 01:07.232
What do you know
about a missing union president?

01:07.234 --> 01:09.601
Frank told me
he ordered the hit.

01:09.603 --> 01:12.204
<i> Stone brought Masucci to trial</i>
<i> for the murder</i>

01:12.206 --> 01:14.440
<i> of union president</i>
<i> Russell Mackey</i>

01:14.442 --> 01:17.409
<i> not knowing he had been</i>
<i> set up by the Don.</i>

01:17.411 --> 01:19.378
I was at the restaurant.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.213
Vinny called.

01:21.215 --> 01:24.383
Asked if he could come in
after I closed.

01:24.385 --> 01:25.484
Then what happened?

01:25.486 --> 01:26.585
Garrotting.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.387
Would you explain to the jury

01:28.389 --> 01:30.155
the meaning of garrotting.

01:30.157 --> 01:35.127
That's a wire around the neck.

01:35.129 --> 01:37.696
It's over... like that.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.698
It appears that you were
confined to a bed

01:39.700 --> 01:43.869
at Manhattan Memorial Hospital
for the entire month of May.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.404
Isn't that correct?

01:45.406 --> 01:48.474
Why are you perjuring yourself,
Mr. Pilefsky?

01:48.476 --> 01:50.576
What has Mr. Stone
promised you?

01:50.578 --> 01:52.611
I did not know
Mr. Pilefsky was lying.

01:52.613 --> 01:53.679
I made no deal

01:53.681 --> 01:55.214
with Mr. Pilefsky,
and I submit

01:55.216 --> 01:57.216
that this entire thing
was a set-up.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.685
Great. Beigel walks,
Masucci walks

01:59.687 --> 02:02.121
and we got squat.

02:04.358 --> 02:07.159
Masucci's not walking.

02:07.161 --> 02:10.395
MAN:
Do you know
what the evidence might be?

02:10.397 --> 02:13.165
MASUCCI:
Well, I have no idea.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.525
I've owned store
14 years.

03:46.527 --> 03:49.761
I sell newspapers, cigarettes

03:49.763 --> 03:52.864
candy and lottery tickets.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.866
I'm interested in the
cigarettes, Mr. Skolnik.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.668
Who do you buy them from?

03:56.670 --> 03:58.537
Suppliers come and go.

03:58.539 --> 04:02.541
I've used, the last two
or three years, Easton Supply.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.775
And do any
other suppliers

04:03.777 --> 04:06.745
ever come offer
their cigarettes?

04:06.747 --> 04:07.980
Every week.

04:07.982 --> 04:09.881
They give you
better deals?

04:09.883 --> 04:12.351
They say
they can deliver faster.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.019
And cheaper?

04:14.021 --> 04:16.521
A penny here, a nickel there.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.957
But did any supplier
ever come to you

04:18.959 --> 04:22.761
and offer you cigarettes
at a greatly reduced price?

04:22.763 --> 04:26.632
Three months ago,
this man said

04:26.634 --> 04:29.635
he would sell me
as much as I want

04:29.637 --> 04:31.803
at five bucks off every carton.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.839
How is that possible,
Mr. Skolnik?

04:36.377 --> 04:38.944
You see this?

04:38.946 --> 04:43.048
This stamp says
tax to state was paid.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.851
His cigarettes
don't have stamp.

04:45.853 --> 04:48.304
Is the man

04:48.305 --> 04:50.756
who tried to sell you
those untaxed cigarettes,

04:50.758 --> 04:52.324
is he in
this courtroom?

04:53.994 --> 04:55.560
That man.

04:55.562 --> 04:57.863
Let the record show

04:57.865 --> 05:02.000
that Mr. Skolnik is pointing
to the defendant, Mario Zalta.

05:02.002 --> 05:06.305
He wears fancy suit,
but he's a crook.

05:06.307 --> 05:10.342
I tell him
i want no part of it.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.377
And what happened then?

05:12.379 --> 05:14.946
His friend Pilefsky

05:14.948 --> 05:17.049
came to see me.

05:19.053 --> 05:23.922
Doctor says
I will never walk again.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.425
I got to tell you,
getting convictions

05:26.427 --> 05:27.993
on Zalta and Pilefsky

05:27.995 --> 05:31.330
is like going to the prom
and scoring bare wrist.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.798
A freakin' consolation prize.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.700
Beigel's the one
who ran the operation.

05:34.702 --> 05:35.901
We can't touch him.

05:35.903 --> 05:36.968
Easy, Max.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.737
Deal making's
part of the system.

05:38.739 --> 05:41.340
Yeah, it makes the wheels
of justice turn faster.

05:41.342 --> 05:42.708
Makes them turn, period

05:42.710 --> 05:44.710
and with Maximum Mathews

05:44.712 --> 05:46.812
handing out the sentence
on Pilefsky and Zalta

05:46.814 --> 05:50.816
they'll be sleeping on the state
for most of the decade.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.951
Yeah, meanwhile
Beigel and Masucci

05:52.953 --> 05:54.986
are hobnobbing at the opera.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.088
Justice is blind, Detective.

05:56.090 --> 05:58.090
Nobody said it was fair.

05:58.092 --> 05:59.858
Explain that to them.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.860
STONE:
Detective, I don't think
you understand

06:01.862 --> 06:03.395
who we're talking about.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.364
Do you know how Masucci

06:05.366 --> 06:07.733
became a made man,
how he made his bones?

06:07.735 --> 06:10.635
He rents a police uniform
and walks into a bar

06:10.637 --> 06:12.471
and pumps three slugs
into the skull

06:12.473 --> 06:14.005
of a 73-year-old bookie.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.742
That's just the first
of seven murders

06:16.744 --> 06:17.876
we know he personally committed,

06:17.878 --> 06:19.444
and God knows
how many he ordered.

06:19.446 --> 06:22.047
And I'll do anything I can
to nail the son of a bitch.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.683
You ever hear of Don Quixote?

06:24.685 --> 06:27.119
You ever hear
about David and Goliath?

06:27.121 --> 06:28.887
And we have God on our side.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.490
SCHIFF:
I tell you, there's no way
you could have predicted

06:31.492 --> 06:33.024
that Pilefsky would lie
on the stand

06:33.026 --> 06:34.726
intending to get caught.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.728
It's unbelievable-- Beigel walks
on the cigarette scam

06:36.730 --> 06:37.963
and double jeopardy
protects Masucci

06:37.965 --> 06:39.698
from being retried
for Mackey's murder.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.099
Do you want
a crying towel?

06:41.101 --> 06:42.901
Where is it written that
you have to win every case?

06:42.903 --> 06:43.902
What do you want to do?

06:43.904 --> 06:45.187
Full-court press--

06:45.188 --> 06:46.471
24-hour surveillance, wiretaps,
the works--

06:46.473 --> 06:48.974
on Masucci and Beigel.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.143
We're gonna need probable cause
to get wiretap warrants.

06:51.145 --> 06:52.944
Go with kidnapping.

06:52.946 --> 06:53.912
Beigel testified

06:53.914 --> 06:55.514
that Mackey was detained

06:55.516 --> 06:58.917
before Masucci had him killed.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.919
Adam, even if we found the body

07:00.921 --> 07:03.688
we couldn't get
a kidnapping conviction.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.924
You said you needed a warrant

07:05.926 --> 07:07.926
not a conviction.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.861
Paul, you've got to talk
to Judge Fishbein.

07:09.863 --> 07:10.862
That's a reach.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.431
A very creative reach.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.166
I want this bastard
as much as you do.

07:14.168 --> 07:15.167
Fishbein's no fool.

07:15.169 --> 07:16.802
This is the way we play him.

07:16.804 --> 07:20.806
You've already tried Masucci
for Mackey's murder.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.108
You lost, Mr. Robinette.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.210
This is America.

07:25.212 --> 07:29.514
One strike and you're out.

07:29.516 --> 07:32.884
Masucci has never been tried
for Mackey's kidnapping.

07:32.886 --> 07:37.823
Question: "Did he offer
any colorful details?"

07:37.825 --> 07:40.792
Answer, Beigel:
"Frank said he was disgusted.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.862
He wasted four hours
trying to convince him."

07:43.864 --> 07:45.681
That's an interesting approach.

07:45.682 --> 07:47.499
All right, let's say
for the sake of argument

07:47.501 --> 07:48.967
that it's not double jeopardy

07:48.969 --> 07:52.170
but you're still barred
by C.P.L. 40.40.

07:52.172 --> 07:55.507
You can't split
jointly prosecutable offenses.

07:55.509 --> 07:58.109
The testimony I just read to you
was given on cross.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.111
It was the first we heard of it.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.981
We couldn't charge him for
a crime we didn't know about.

08:02.983 --> 08:06.485
Even so, Masucci's confession
to Beigel isn't enough.

08:06.487 --> 08:09.120
You still need corroboration
to convict.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.989
That's why we need a warrant.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.558
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Ah...

08:13.560 --> 08:15.527
A warrant.

08:15.529 --> 08:18.163
Sounds like
a fishing license to me.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.198
Masucci confessed to Beigel.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.834
Beigel took the stand
and swore to it.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.554
The people aren't fishing,
Your Honor.

08:25.555 --> 08:28.273
The people<i> are</i> counting on
the parties under surveillance

08:28.275 --> 08:31.009
happening to mention
unrelated criminal activities.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.845
The people have
great expectations, Your Honor.

08:40.220 --> 08:43.154
It's a 30-day warrant to monitor
Beigel and Masucci's telephones.

08:43.156 --> 08:44.856
For what?

08:44.858 --> 08:45.891
Mackey's kidnapping.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.259
You're kidding.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.626
And anything else
you might hear.

08:48.629 --> 08:49.961
All right!

08:49.963 --> 08:52.130
How did you get Fishbein
to sign this?

08:52.132 --> 08:54.299
We led him to water
and he actually drank.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.968
What do you think?
Fenton and Vitello?

08:56.970 --> 08:58.537
They're on the Dworkin homicide.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.038
Been eight weeks,
they got squat.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.974
In two weeks, Dworkin
will be just as cold.

09:02.976 --> 09:06.311
WOMAN:
<i> like this. assignments</i>

09:06.313 --> 09:08.079
Makes me hotter
than a firecracker.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.564
Could you fill us in

09:09.565 --> 09:11.048
on what caused all this
vasco-congestion?

09:11.051 --> 09:14.619
Beigel hasn't left his office,
yet, but he ordered Chinese.

09:14.621 --> 09:16.021
I bet on
the orange beef.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.556
Cost him ten bucks.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.157
Son of a gun orders moo shoo
at two to one.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.709
No?

09:20.710 --> 09:22.260
Guys with glasses,
I can read them like a book.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.863
Anything we can use
against Mr. Beigel?

09:24.865 --> 09:27.866
Dinner at 8:00 with the missus
at Parioli.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.267
That's expensive, not illegal.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.069
Could get
more expensive.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.071
Lunch with Laurel at 1:00.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.606
Very mysterious.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.675
I got 20 says she's a brunette.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.877
The guy wears glasses--
we're talking blonde.

09:41.648 --> 09:44.349
So it's about 3:00 a.m.

09:44.351 --> 09:47.352
I wake up to the sound
of barking.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.854
This one has a dog?

09:49.856 --> 09:51.256
I wish.

09:51.258 --> 09:55.226
I ask her what's going on,
she says "cockroaches."

09:55.228 --> 09:57.662
Cockroaches that bark?

09:57.664 --> 09:59.364
That's what I said.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.299
She says the exterminator
was a bust

10:01.301 --> 10:04.135
so she bought a gecko.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.688
It's a lizard.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.240
Some kind of gila monster
from Brazil or something.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.142
And it eats roaches?

10:11.144 --> 10:13.244
Down to the last drop.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.647
Barks when it's hungry.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.286
Blonde.

10:21.288 --> 10:26.658
Vitello must be working
on some kind of E.S.P.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.661
So Beigel's got a number
on the side, huh?

10:29.663 --> 10:34.032
You really think that's enough
to get him to roll on Masucci?

10:34.034 --> 10:36.334
A wife scorned
is a scary prospect.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.171
LOGAN:
Look at that.

10:40.173 --> 10:43.141
GREEVEY:
Doesn't look like
true love to me.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.627
Business.

10:45.628 --> 10:48.112
Let's see what kind
of business Laurel's in.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.933
Nice day.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.368
You come here often?

11:10.370 --> 11:12.037
Holster it, cowboy.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.738
Leather bores me.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.079
Nice line.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.681
Bitch.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.988
Hey, maybe
he's not cheating.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.957
Not on his wife anyway.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.693
You know what?

11:34.695 --> 11:37.395
I'm going
to really enjoy this.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.397
Let's not tip her.

11:39.399 --> 11:42.467
No, we got to do
some research.

11:46.473 --> 11:49.174
Beigel's got
six residential buildings

11:49.176 --> 11:50.475
mostly in the village.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.277
Four-story walk-ups.
Rent controlled.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.978
From '80 to '88

11:53.980 --> 11:57.148
Beigel made the<i> Post's</i>
50 worst landlord list.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.350
Last two years, he's spotless.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.119
Maybe he got religion.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.221
He got a building inspector.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.723
Since '88

12:04.725 --> 12:06.791
all inspections
on Beigel's buildings

12:06.793 --> 12:08.793
were done by one Laurel McGinty.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.762
Are you saying
he bought her?

12:10.764 --> 12:12.997
Okay, have the buildings
reinspected.

12:12.999 --> 12:15.166
See what Ms. McGinty
may have overlooked.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.068
What's bribery
of a public official?

12:17.070 --> 12:19.237
A "D" felony.
Two and third to seven.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.371
You think it's heavy enough

12:20.373 --> 12:22.073
to squeeze something
out of Beigel?

12:22.075 --> 12:24.275
Two and a third to seven
in Attica?

12:24.277 --> 12:27.178
Beigel's got to know he couldn't
do three weeks hard time.

12:27.180 --> 12:30.181
MAN:
Look at that local
law ten violation.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.382
The facade, see?

12:31.384 --> 12:32.817
Chipped bricks.

12:32.819 --> 12:35.086
That's a quick
two grand.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.254
Buildings was here

12:36.256 --> 12:37.789
two months ago.

12:37.791 --> 12:40.225
Your guys passed
with flying aces.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.393
Inspector must
have been dreaming.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.062
Between me and you

12:44.064 --> 12:45.130
Buildings is strictly amateur.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.165
We beat 'em six years straight.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.500
Beat them?

12:48.502 --> 12:51.369
You're city, too.
What the hell.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.138
We have this wager going,
you know?

12:53.140 --> 12:55.473
Who can raise the most
for the Apple.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.275
Fire against Buildings.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.376
Like I told you before,

12:58.378 --> 13:00.862
Fire Department
wins every year.

13:00.863 --> 13:03.347
You guys actually bet on who can
write the most violations?

13:03.350 --> 13:05.383
Tell me you don't bet
against parking tickets?

13:05.385 --> 13:07.085
Hey, come on,
it's for a good cause.

13:07.087 --> 13:10.054
The city raises
a bundle in fines.

13:10.056 --> 13:12.323
Where do you think your last
raise came from, anyway?

13:12.325 --> 13:15.160
Do we have any more
code violations here?

13:15.162 --> 13:17.262
Are you kidding?

13:19.900 --> 13:21.900
Look at that,
will you?

13:21.902 --> 13:23.234
Defective ladder.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.236
That's another
quick two grand.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.372
I inspect five buildings a day

13:27.374 --> 13:28.907
five days a week

13:28.909 --> 13:30.575
50 weeks a year.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.577
So I missed
a couple of violations.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.078
I'm human.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.513
You never lost
a case, Mr. Stone?

13:35.515 --> 13:37.282
One mistake is human,

13:37.284 --> 13:38.817
and two is, perhaps,
some lapse

13:38.819 --> 13:40.585
in concentration,
three is stupid.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.921
But the same mistake
consistently

13:42.923 --> 13:44.455
over a period of two years
indicates

13:44.457 --> 13:46.457
another form
of human fallibility here.

13:46.459 --> 13:47.559
Such as what?

13:47.561 --> 13:48.593
Greed.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.528
I've done nothing improper.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.096
You had lunch

13:52.098 --> 13:53.131
with Harv Beigel.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.199
It's what they mean

13:54.201 --> 13:55.466
by the appearance
of impropriety

13:55.468 --> 13:58.203
Ms. McGinty, and I'll do worse
than indict you.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.938
You can't prove anything.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.256
Don't count on that.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.573
The D.A.'s subpoena
is a powerful weapon.

14:02.576 --> 14:04.876
If I have to,
I will question every landlord

14:04.878 --> 14:07.278
of every building you inspected
over a decade

14:07.280 --> 14:09.247
and one of them, I assure you,

14:09.249 --> 14:12.250
will turn you in
to protect his own good name.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.853
We've had the buildings
reinspected.

14:14.855 --> 14:18.489
43 glaring violations
never made it into your reports.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.558
We'd like to know why.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.962
How much did Beigel pay you
to look the other way?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.469
Ms. McGinty, it's not you
we're after, it's Beigel.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.571
If you testify,
you get immunity.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.640
If you don't, you go to prison.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.575
I'm sure the former
is preferable

14:37.577 --> 14:39.310
don't you think?

14:45.418 --> 14:47.285
I got it.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.456
Evening, Mr. Beigel.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.258
Great. What now?

14:53.260 --> 14:54.993
You're under arrest

14:54.995 --> 14:57.528
for bribery
of a public official.

15:00.967 --> 15:04.402
$300,000 bail, Your Honor,
is not only excessive

15:04.404 --> 15:06.170
it's vindictive.

15:06.172 --> 15:08.573
Mr. Beigel is charged
with bribery of a city official

15:08.575 --> 15:11.976
a crime that has allowed him
to cloak his total disregard

15:11.978 --> 15:14.545
for the safety
and well being of his tenants.

15:14.547 --> 15:17.682
The only thing that is being
cloaked here, Your Honor,

15:17.684 --> 15:19.384
is the district attorney's
own malicious...

15:19.386 --> 15:21.419
That's enough, Mr. Leclaire.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.622
Bail is set at $100,000,
cash or bond.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.327
Do you know what
you're doing, Mr. Stone?

15:29.329 --> 15:31.529
Yes, Mrs. Beigel.
I am attempting

15:31.531 --> 15:33.197
to put your brother
in prison.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.666
By getting
my husband killed?

15:34.668 --> 15:37.368
Because that's what
you're setting in motion.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.945
Bribery in the second degree.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.179
You'll
never convict.

15:48.181 --> 15:51.149
I'll take my chances.

15:51.151 --> 15:54.118
Laurel McGinty
is just some pissant

15:54.120 --> 15:55.670
building inspector.

15:55.671 --> 15:57.221
Okay, maybe Mr. Beigel
bought her a cup of coffee

15:57.223 --> 16:00.158
or a cheese danish every
now and then, but no way

16:00.160 --> 16:02.427
does that add up to seven years.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.462
No judge is gonna
take this seriously.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.064
Anyone who offers
any benefit--

16:06.066 --> 16:08.733
whether it be a cheese danish
or the Hope Diamond--

16:08.735 --> 16:11.436
to a public official
with the intention

16:11.438 --> 16:13.671
of influencing
his or her discretion

16:13.673 --> 16:15.139
is guilty of bribery.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.274
And you're wrong,
Mr. Laclare.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.543
Some people take that
very seriously.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.578
Mountains out of molehills.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.214
Besides, you need evidence
of illicit payments.

16:23.216 --> 16:27.986
Ms. McGinty will prove, I think,
a very credible witness.

16:27.988 --> 16:31.155
Who will say anything
to save her own skin.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.757
Have you anything else

16:32.759 --> 16:35.526
before we see each other
in court?

16:35.528 --> 16:36.694
Uh-huh.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.163
A: bribery is a predicate act.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.532
B: Mr. Beigel's company

16:41.534 --> 16:43.668
Meridian Property
Management

16:43.670 --> 16:46.221
is an enterprise.

16:46.222 --> 16:48.773
C: Mr. Beigel conducted
the affairs of his enterprise

16:48.775 --> 16:52.110
through a series
of racketeering activities.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.545
Do you know what that
spells out, Mr. Beigel?

16:54.547 --> 16:58.049
Rico-- the current favorite
federal felony

16:58.051 --> 16:59.717
among publicity-starved

16:59.719 --> 17:01.386
U.S. Attorneys.

17:01.387 --> 17:03.054
Now, would you care
for me to call him?

17:03.056 --> 17:05.723
You can't swat flies
with nuclear weapons.

17:05.725 --> 17:08.192
Mike Milken got, what?
Ten years?

17:10.063 --> 17:13.031
Get me the southern district
U.S. Attorney's office, please.

17:13.033 --> 17:15.700
Spare me the theatrics,
all right?

17:15.702 --> 17:18.202
Cancel the call.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.670
Thanks.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.709
Nobody wants a trial, okay?

17:24.711 --> 17:28.046
We'll plead
to unlawful gratuities

17:28.048 --> 17:29.747
and give you McGinty.

17:29.749 --> 17:32.050
You don't get my point, do you?

17:32.052 --> 17:33.751
I gave Ms. McGinty a walk.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.319
I want Masucci.

17:37.190 --> 17:41.559
Yeah, and I want
to keep on breathing.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.094
Let's go.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.638
We're wasting our time.

17:53.640 --> 17:58.142
Masucci's not dumb enough
to do business over his phone.

17:58.144 --> 18:00.545
Maybe we'll get lucky
on the pay phones.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.380
People make mistakes--
even Dons.

18:02.382 --> 18:05.550
Yeah, well, we don't even know
what we're looking for

18:05.552 --> 18:06.717
by the way.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.719
We'll know when we see it.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.088
(<i> yawning</i> ):
You ask me,

18:10.090 --> 18:14.358
you'll never get Beigel
to give up Masucci.

18:14.360 --> 18:17.328
That's not what
Stone thinks.

18:17.330 --> 18:21.666
The hitter who supposedly
killed Russell Mackey?

18:21.668 --> 18:23.234
Ruffo?

18:23.236 --> 18:24.635
Yeah, what's his first name?

18:24.637 --> 18:26.237
Vincent. You
got something?

18:26.239 --> 18:27.672
Could be.

18:27.674 --> 18:30.675
Dig out last Tuesday's tapes
on Masucci's phone.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.243
Hey, Frank, it's Vinny.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.212
Here we go,
this is Masucci.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.848
When you getting in?
Tomorrow.

18:36.850 --> 18:40.218
Good. I might want you
to talk to Beigel.

18:40.220 --> 18:43.221
Really?
Yeah. I'll let you know.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.523
Vinny.
If it is Ruffo

18:45.524 --> 18:47.824
and Masucci tells him to talk to
Beigel, that means that...

18:47.827 --> 18:49.827
He's more than just
a brother-in-law.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.597
Yeah, I knew the guy was slime.

18:52.599 --> 18:55.233
Pilefsky used to be buddies
with Ruffo.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.401
He could recognize
Ruffo's voice.

18:57.403 --> 18:59.437
Hey, stupid
isn't suicidal.

18:59.439 --> 19:02.707
Maybe we can scare him
more than Masucci can.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.642
If we can't, I know who can.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.378
Three years ago we nailed
a Masucci hitter.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.446
D'Agastino?

19:09.415 --> 19:12.316
He should still be in the slam.

19:12.318 --> 19:15.620
What do you say
we go rattle Pilefsky's cage?

19:15.622 --> 19:17.155
Hey, Frank, it's Vinny.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.923
When you getting in?

19:18.925 --> 19:20.191
Tomorrow.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.443
Good.

19:22.444 --> 19:24.694
to talk to Beigel.
I might want you

19:24.697 --> 19:28.699
Really?
Yeah. I'll let you know.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.334
So?

19:30.336 --> 19:32.703
So is that Ruffo?

19:32.705 --> 19:34.455
Could be.

19:34.456 --> 19:36.206
Could also be Dolly Parton.
What do I know?

19:36.209 --> 19:37.341
You're right, Max.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.677
This guy is as stupid
as he looks.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.346
I got this friend
over at the<i> Post.</i>

19:42.348 --> 19:45.883
Hasn't had a hot story
for months.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.752
I bet it would be

19:47.754 --> 19:49.687
a big boost to his career

19:49.689 --> 19:52.957
if I gave him an exclusive
on how Joe Pilefsky

19:52.959 --> 19:54.892
ratted out Frank Masucci.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.327
Yeah, what do you
think, Max?

19:56.329 --> 19:58.663
Old Joe here would be
breathing another, what?

19:58.665 --> 20:01.232
Five, maybe six days?

20:01.234 --> 20:03.201
Nah. Three tops,

20:03.203 --> 20:05.803
but if he told us
about Beigel's role

20:05.805 --> 20:07.939
in the Masucci
family business

20:07.941 --> 20:11.709
I'm sure he could live
a long and prosperous life.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.445
We got nothing to lose, Joe.

20:14.447 --> 20:17.682
We figure we put
the word out on you

20:17.684 --> 20:19.317
tell Zalta we did it.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.419
Sit back, wait,
see what happens.

20:21.421 --> 20:22.787
My bet?

20:22.789 --> 20:24.989
He's going to be
very cooperative.

20:24.991 --> 20:28.226
This is illegal.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.260
Sue us.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.729
Let's go, Mike.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.533
You're bluffing.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.301
Yeah, you're right,
we'd be real upset

20:37.303 --> 20:40.905
if something happened
to a piece of crap like you.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.841
(<i> Greevey laughing</i> )

20:47.413 --> 20:50.248
"An unnamed soldier
in the Masucci family

20:50.250 --> 20:51.515
"already in custody
awaiting sentencing

20:51.517 --> 20:54.719
"on an assault conviction

20:54.721 --> 20:56.988
"with the district
attorney's office

20:56.990 --> 20:59.757
according to reliable
police sources."

20:59.759 --> 21:01.926
Did Pilefsky get
the early edition?

21:01.928 --> 21:04.562
All we got to do
is turn up the heat.

21:04.564 --> 21:07.498
Guess who's down from Attica
for a court appearance?

21:07.500 --> 21:09.634
D'Agastino.

21:09.635 --> 21:11.769
We want to offer him
a year off his sentence.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.305
I'll get stone to get it
from Judge Faddenhecht.

21:14.307 --> 21:16.474
They still do
that crap, huh?

21:16.476 --> 21:18.776
Verified by three sources.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.750
That's it?

21:25.752 --> 21:26.884
That's it.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.786
You'll put it
in writing?

21:28.788 --> 21:30.955
Signed, sealed
and delivered.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.925
Deal?

21:36.062 --> 21:39.397
Take off another year,
I'll do it naked.

21:39.399 --> 21:43.000
There are three calls on my log
from Pilefsky's lawyer

21:43.002 --> 21:44.535
and it's not
even 10:00.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.304
You got it on tape?

21:46.306 --> 21:49.940
Yes, the cameras are
always on in the yard.

21:55.315 --> 21:59.583
Here's our friend,
Mr. D'Agastino.

22:04.524 --> 22:07.591
Over to Pilefsky.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.532
STONE:
Bang. The Judas Kiss.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.434
SCHIFF:
Brother.

22:16.436 --> 22:20.371
And one scared,
marked man.

22:20.373 --> 22:23.040
Right on the mouth.
Would you believe that?

22:23.042 --> 22:26.444
Mr. D'Agastino should
consider a career in theater.

22:26.446 --> 22:27.611
It plays like opera

22:27.613 --> 22:29.547
except they kill
the singers.

22:29.549 --> 22:32.049
Let's see what key
Mr. Pilefsky sings in.

22:32.051 --> 22:34.018
Right.

22:34.020 --> 22:38.889
Yeah. I'll let you know.
MAN (<i> on tape</i> ):

22:38.891 --> 22:40.558
Yeah. Yeah.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.426
It's Ruffo.

22:42.428 --> 22:43.961
Those sons
of bitches!

22:43.963 --> 22:44.962
Those cops!

22:44.964 --> 22:46.864
They planted
that story.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.866
Not my department.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.501
Your meeting.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.603
Sure you don't want
your attorney present?

22:52.605 --> 22:53.938
Is he that stupid?!

22:53.940 --> 22:55.539
Oh, God, I'm a dead man.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.375
Who the hell do you think

22:57.377 --> 22:59.076
pays for my attorney?

22:59.078 --> 23:00.978
You got to put me with the Feds.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.079
New identity,
witness protection.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.614
See how easy that was?

23:03.616 --> 23:05.416
You said the magic word.

23:05.418 --> 23:06.417
What word?

23:06.419 --> 23:07.651
Witness.

23:07.653 --> 23:09.120
What do you want?

23:09.122 --> 23:12.423
Is Beigel part
of the Masucci organization?

23:12.425 --> 23:15.459
Is the Pope Polish?

23:15.461 --> 23:17.061
How high up is he?

23:17.063 --> 23:19.029
Frank keeps
himself aloof,
you know what I mean?

23:19.031 --> 23:20.965
That way nobody can say,
"Frank said this."

23:20.967 --> 23:23.100
Everybody knows, Beigel opens
his mouth it's Frank talking.

23:23.102 --> 23:24.969
That include hits?

23:24.971 --> 23:27.071
That especially includes hits.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.573
Is that always the way
it's done?

23:29.575 --> 23:31.642
Ever since Beigel
married Frank's sister.

23:34.113 --> 23:36.447
He said that's always
the way it's done--

23:36.449 --> 23:38.449
From Masucci to Beigel
to the hitter.

23:38.451 --> 23:40.951
So Beigel must have given
the order on Mackey.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.053
We can't retry Masucci,
but Beigel's fair game.

23:43.055 --> 23:45.122
Yeah, well, Pilefsky's
a convicted perjurer.

23:45.124 --> 23:47.191
Not strong enough
to go to court.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.160
Strong enough
to twist Beigel.

23:49.162 --> 23:50.461
How far can I go?

23:50.463 --> 23:52.596
Well, you can deal him
down, but not out.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.098
Prison, not jail.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.700
Figure it out.

23:56.702 --> 23:58.736
Turn on your brights, Stone.

23:58.738 --> 24:02.440
My client has nothing to do
with Mackey's murder.

24:02.442 --> 24:04.608
We don't even know if he's
dead, for God's sake.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.510
True or false,
Mr. Beigel--

24:06.512 --> 24:08.746
Frank Masucci told you
that Ruffo

24:08.748 --> 24:10.481
took care of Russell Mackey
for good.

24:10.483 --> 24:12.116
Now, before you answer,

24:12.117 --> 24:13.750
remember that you testified
to that fact in court.

24:13.753 --> 24:16.487
If you want to change your mind
now, we can tack perjury

24:16.489 --> 24:18.689
on to your
bribery charge.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.691
He talked, I listened.

24:20.693 --> 24:22.126
No crime in that.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.594
Depends on what you hear.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.564
What I hear is that it was you

24:26.566 --> 24:28.032
who gave the Mackey contract
to Ruffo.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.467
I hear conspiracy
to murder,

24:29.469 --> 24:30.968
and what<i> you</i> hear is 25 to life.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.103
Without evidence,
I hear "not guilty."

24:33.105 --> 24:35.656
We've got Joe Pilefsky.

24:35.657 --> 24:38.208
He's willing to testify to
Masucci's entire organization.

24:38.211 --> 24:40.177
Your boat has sprung
a leak, Mr. Biegel.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.545
You're knee-deep.

24:41.547 --> 24:43.681
Pilefsky is
a convicted perjurer.

24:43.683 --> 24:46.650
We've got tapes on Masucci
and on Ruffo.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.086
And guess who's name keeps
coming up over and over again?

24:49.088 --> 24:51.489
The water's rising, gentlemen.

24:51.491 --> 24:52.857
Illegal tap.

24:52.858 --> 24:54.224
Warrant, signed,
sealed and delivered.

24:54.227 --> 24:55.659
It's up to your neck.

24:56.963 --> 24:59.129
There's no way, Stone.

24:59.131 --> 25:03.701
There is no way
I give up Frank.

25:03.703 --> 25:06.971
All right, give me Ruffo.

25:06.973 --> 25:08.172
What do you give me?

25:08.174 --> 25:09.273
Man one.

25:09.275 --> 25:12.776
If I testify against Ruffo

25:12.778 --> 25:16.680
then I won't live six months.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.516
I'll guarantee you protection.

25:18.518 --> 25:19.583
That's a joke.

25:19.585 --> 25:21.085
You see me
laughing?

25:21.087 --> 25:22.786
I'll take my chances.

25:22.788 --> 25:26.590
Then tell me
where to find Ruffo.

25:27.693 --> 25:32.630
Man two, with a sentencing
recommendation.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.600
If I find him,
you got your deal.

25:36.602 --> 25:39.003
How does it work?

25:39.005 --> 25:41.739
He calls me.

25:41.741 --> 25:44.041
Sends a car to pick me up.

25:44.043 --> 25:47.011
I don't know where I'm going
till I get there.

25:47.013 --> 25:50.714
When do you know
who he's in town to hit?

25:50.716 --> 25:55.052
Frank doesn't let me know
till the last minute.

25:55.054 --> 25:59.189
He calls me on the car phone,
he gives me a name.

25:59.191 --> 26:01.058
Ruffo meets the car

26:01.060 --> 26:03.694
I give him
the name.

26:03.696 --> 26:06.597
There is no way

26:06.599 --> 26:12.636
I am going to say this
in court.

26:16.842 --> 26:21.078
Two teams have been on Beigel
since he left your office.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.613
Ruffo call?

26:22.615 --> 26:25.215
Not yet.

26:25.217 --> 26:27.718
You don't approve.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.620
Beigel as much as confessed

26:29.622 --> 26:32.590
he was involved
in Russell Mackey's murder.

26:32.592 --> 26:34.758
I dealt Beigel
down to man two

26:34.760 --> 26:36.360
because through Beigel,
we get Ruffo,

26:36.362 --> 26:38.295
through Ruffo we get Masucci.

26:38.297 --> 26:40.264
You trusted Beigel before.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.365
It backfired.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.300
It's not about me.

26:43.302 --> 26:44.702
No?
No, it's about

26:44.704 --> 26:45.803
getting Masucci, that's the game

26:45.805 --> 26:46.770
we're playing here.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.238
What's being played here is you.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.873
You let Masucci get
under your skin.

26:49.875 --> 26:51.792
Now he's controlling
the agenda.

26:51.793 --> 26:53.710
I wasn't aware that tenacity
in pursuit of a criminal

26:53.713 --> 26:55.312
was a character flaw.

26:55.314 --> 26:58.082
You can dress it up
any way you want to, Ben.

26:58.084 --> 27:00.184
It still looks like
payback time to me.

27:04.190 --> 27:08.192
The Russians say that revenge
is the sweetest passion.

27:08.194 --> 27:12.796
Yeah, and the Sicilians say
it's a meal best served cold.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.888
Ruffo just picked up Beigel.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.923
Headed south on Irving Place.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.994
We got 'em

27:47.266 --> 27:49.667
What do you think--
linguine at Elio's?

27:49.669 --> 27:52.269
Twenty bucks says osso
bucco at Primavera.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.405
They got a white wine
and mushroom sauce

27:54.407 --> 27:55.873
that dances
on your tongue.

27:55.875 --> 27:59.009
We should all eat
as well as they do.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.277
Crime pays, Max.

28:00.279 --> 28:01.345
For lunch, anyway.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.982
GREEVEY:
Change of course.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.750
Left on Sixteenth.

28:06.752 --> 28:08.686
We got 'em.

28:11.223 --> 28:12.690
We'll cruise Fourteenth.

28:12.692 --> 28:14.391
I guess that
knocks it for Primavera.

28:14.393 --> 28:17.461
I'm keeping my 20
on the table right now.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.437
We're gonna
lose 'em.

28:26.439 --> 28:27.771
We got a problem
here.

28:27.773 --> 28:28.772
Take over now.

28:28.774 --> 28:29.873
Where is he?!

28:29.875 --> 28:31.975
towards Third.
They're heading

28:48.260 --> 28:49.960
Damn!

28:56.335 --> 28:59.470
We checked his office;
we checked his house.

28:59.472 --> 29:01.338
You talk to the wife?

29:01.340 --> 29:02.339
She wasn't in.

29:02.341 --> 29:03.974
Damn it! We look
like jerks here.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.843
There's nothing else
we can do tonight.

29:05.845 --> 29:08.378
We'll talk to the limo
driver in the morning.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.913
Damn it.

29:10.983 --> 29:13.751
<i> I get this call--</i>

29:13.753 --> 29:16.053
pick up Mr. Harvey Beigel,
drive him to the Plaza.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.021
After that, it's as directed.

29:18.023 --> 29:19.289
And?

29:19.291 --> 29:20.924
I drove him to the Plaza.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.459
I let him out.
I waited.

29:22.461 --> 29:25.062
And then what?

29:25.064 --> 29:26.830
He comes out
about three hours later,

29:26.832 --> 29:29.433
around 11:00,
and says I can pack it in.

29:29.435 --> 29:32.302
He didn't want
to be taken home?

29:32.304 --> 29:35.339
No. He said he was in
the Oak Room, went back inside.

29:35.341 --> 29:37.541
I got the car in
around 11:18.

29:37.543 --> 29:39.443
Nice tip,
no mess in the back seat--

29:39.445 --> 29:41.044
the best kind of night.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.916
WOMAN:
Sorry, I can't help you.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.818
Better ask one
of the waiters.

29:47.820 --> 29:49.086
We already did.

29:49.088 --> 29:50.988
He was wearing
a fedora.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.422
Latest yuppie
affectation.

29:52.424 --> 29:55.325
They all want
to look like their fathers.

29:55.327 --> 29:56.994
I still can't help you.

29:56.996 --> 29:58.328
Are you sure?

29:58.330 --> 30:00.531
I mean, the place
was busy last night.

30:00.533 --> 30:04.134
Listen, if somebody spends
three hours at one of my tables

30:04.136 --> 30:06.403
I'm gonna remember him,
hat or no hat.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.572
Count on it.
He wasn't here.

30:09.909 --> 30:12.476
<i> My husband owns property</i>
<i> in Connecticut.</i>

30:12.478 --> 30:15.579
It's likely
that's where he is.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.581
Well, uh, he wouldn't
have called you?

30:17.583 --> 30:19.416
Harv's a big boy

30:19.418 --> 30:21.552
and I'm not
a possessive woman.

30:21.554 --> 30:24.021
You have
a very trusting relationship.

30:24.023 --> 30:25.956
We respect each other's privacy.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.891
Isn't that the way
it's supposed to be?

30:27.893 --> 30:28.892
Whatever works.

30:28.894 --> 30:30.394
The point is, Mrs. Beigel

30:30.396 --> 30:33.997
your husband had a meeting
yesterday with Vincent Ruffo

30:33.999 --> 30:38.168
and he's been M.I.A.
ever since.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.504
You heard of Vincent Ruffo?

30:41.574 --> 30:43.874
He's an associate
of your brother's.

30:43.876 --> 30:45.976
Sergeant, we have nothing more
to talk about.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.444
If you don't mind

30:47.446 --> 30:50.047
I promised
to take my daughter shopping.

30:52.384 --> 30:53.917
Hey, come here.

30:53.919 --> 30:56.453
What's the big deal, huh?

30:56.455 --> 31:00.457
So maybe I pad the bill
by half an hour.

31:00.459 --> 31:02.392
Is that a federal crime?

31:02.394 --> 31:04.027
Your passenger never came home.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.063
Maybe he got lucky.

31:06.065 --> 31:08.432
Hey, listen- you don't come
clean with us

31:08.434 --> 31:10.534
you're going to be
cracking your nuts

31:10.536 --> 31:12.069
inside a cage.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.537
Just between us, right?

31:13.539 --> 31:16.440
I could lose
my chauffeur's license.

31:18.477 --> 31:21.612
Half an hour
after he goes into the Plaza

31:21.614 --> 31:25.048
Beigel comes out with this guy,
face like a fist.

31:25.050 --> 31:27.050
They want
to borrow my car.

31:27.052 --> 31:28.051
What for?

31:28.053 --> 31:29.219
I'm not dumb enough to ask.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.054
He gives me a couple of hundreds

31:31.056 --> 31:34.658
and tells me I can pick up the
car three hours, pier 26.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.060
You always give
your car up that easy?

31:37.062 --> 31:39.596
Some people
you don't say "no" to.

31:39.598 --> 31:40.964
I got out.

31:40.966 --> 31:42.499
Guy takes the wheel.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.034
Beigel gets in beside.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.636
When you got the car back?

31:45.638 --> 31:48.605
Clean as when it left, except
couple more hundred on the seat

31:48.607 --> 31:51.008
and 50 more miles
on the odometer.

31:51.010 --> 31:52.609
Your car's got a phone, right?

31:52.611 --> 31:53.944
Yeah, and a TV.

31:53.946 --> 31:56.079
Can you tell
if the phone's been used?

31:56.081 --> 31:59.650
Sure. The customer gets charged
for incoming and outgoing calls.

31:59.652 --> 32:01.218
And last night?

32:01.220 --> 32:03.453
Nobody touched it.

32:06.926 --> 32:09.493
CRAGEN:
You think Beigel
fled the jurisdiction?

32:09.495 --> 32:10.994
I think he's dead.

32:10.996 --> 32:13.096
And I got a feeling so does
Katherine Beigel.

32:13.098 --> 32:15.632
Masucci had Beigel
Ruffoed.

32:15.634 --> 32:18.235
The way we see it is
he set up a meeting

32:18.237 --> 32:20.070
with Beigel and Ruffo.

32:20.072 --> 32:21.505
That much we got on tape.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.674
But Masucci
never called the car

32:23.676 --> 32:26.944
to give Beigel
the name of the hit.

32:26.946 --> 32:29.446
Which means that the name
was Beigel.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.214
Stone's right.
His own brother-in-law?

32:31.216 --> 32:33.083
This guy's a mad dog.

32:33.085 --> 32:34.251
Beigel might have been family

32:34.253 --> 32:36.520
but he wasn't family
with a Sicilian "F."

32:36.522 --> 32:37.988
That explains why Mrs. Beigel

32:37.990 --> 32:40.057
has been calling
her brother all afternoon.

32:40.059 --> 32:41.959
Five calls
in the last three hours.

32:41.961 --> 32:43.193
Masucci's ducking her.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.294
Probably doesn't want to hear

32:44.296 --> 32:45.996
how much she enoys
being a widow.

32:45.998 --> 32:48.565
Great-- now we got to keep
the tail on the sister.

32:48.567 --> 32:51.034
Nail Masucci
through his sister?

32:51.036 --> 32:52.703
Feels like a reach.

32:52.705 --> 32:54.655
Well, I don't like it either.

32:54.656 --> 32:56.606
You got any better ideas,
I'll be glad to take them.

32:56.608 --> 32:57.607
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

32:57.609 --> 32:58.675
What?

32:58.677 --> 33:00.177
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

33:00.179 --> 33:02.713
They'll be there in 15 minutes.

33:02.715 --> 33:06.183
Mrs. Beigel
is at La Stanza in the Village.

33:06.185 --> 33:08.085
So is Masucci.

33:17.129 --> 33:19.162
It's been an hour.

33:19.164 --> 33:23.100
My guess, he isn't just
lingering over dessert.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.167
(<i> chuckling</i> )

33:27.339 --> 33:29.106
You're jerking me around.

33:29.108 --> 33:31.208
My husband has been missing
for two days, Frank.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.243
Listen, you're supposed
to know what's better!

33:34.213 --> 33:35.212
I like that woman.

33:35.214 --> 33:36.747
Yeah, you would.

33:36.749 --> 33:38.782
KATHERINE:
<i> What Frank and I talked about</i>

33:38.784 --> 33:41.084
<i> is our business.</i>

33:41.086 --> 33:43.520
STONE:
When it involves
your husband's disappearance

33:43.522 --> 33:45.873
it becomes
our business.

33:45.874 --> 33:48.225
I understand that you're caught
between conflicting loyalties.

33:48.227 --> 33:51.328
You don't understand
anything about my loyalties.

33:51.330 --> 33:54.197
You know what happened
to your husband.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.099
So do we,
we can't prove it, though.

33:56.101 --> 33:58.702
What exactly
does Mrs. Beigel know?

33:58.704 --> 34:02.272
That Frank Masucci found
her husband to be a liability

34:02.274 --> 34:03.607
ordered him killed.

34:03.609 --> 34:06.176
And this evidence

34:06.177 --> 34:08.744
might help you
see the truth of
what I'm saying.

34:08.747 --> 34:10.680
This is a recording
of a telephone call

34:10.682 --> 34:12.182
Vincent Ruffo placed
to Frank Masucci

34:12.184 --> 34:16.286
two days before
your husband's disappearance.

34:16.288 --> 34:18.388
Frank, it's Vinny.

34:18.390 --> 34:19.689
When did you get in?
MASUCCI:

34:19.691 --> 34:20.724
Late yesterday.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.325
you talk to.
Howard's the guy

34:22.327 --> 34:23.560
But, Frank...

34:23.562 --> 34:25.095
I said
talk to Beigel.

34:25.097 --> 34:26.263
Give him a buzz.

34:26.265 --> 34:29.266
(<i> click</i> )

34:29.268 --> 34:32.402
Now, what does
"give him a buzz" mean?

34:35.174 --> 34:36.673
What do you think it means?

34:36.675 --> 34:40.243
That your brother told Vinny
Ruffo to kill your husband.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.815
Even if we accept
your interpretation

34:44.817 --> 34:46.716
what Frank Masucci does...

34:46.718 --> 34:47.617
Michael.

34:50.155 --> 34:51.788
What do you want from me,
Mr. Stone?

34:51.790 --> 34:53.190
Answers. Evidence.

34:53.192 --> 34:56.693
I want to find out
where your husband is.

34:56.695 --> 34:59.296
It's only rumor.

34:59.298 --> 35:01.298
Hearsay at best.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.266
Mrs. Beigel
is not involved

35:03.268 --> 35:05.102
with her brother's affairs

35:05.104 --> 35:07.604
and will not,
under any circumstances

35:07.606 --> 35:09.172
testify against him.

35:09.174 --> 35:12.309
Remember, this is
purely speculation.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.377
Speculate, Mrs. Beigel.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.316
There's a place...

35:20.319 --> 35:21.685
in New Jersey.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.863
GREEVEY:
What do we
got so far?

35:32.865 --> 35:34.297
LOGAN:
Masucci's greatest hits.

35:34.299 --> 35:37.334
A double there,
a single there.

35:37.336 --> 35:41.204
This one's
folded in half.

35:41.206 --> 35:43.206
GREEVEY:
Anyone recent?

35:43.208 --> 35:44.708
Just bones and hair.

35:47.713 --> 35:49.146
The Garden State.

35:49.148 --> 35:50.747
Only to the mob.

35:50.749 --> 35:53.250
I'm still not sure
about the jurisdiction.

35:53.252 --> 35:54.818
Let the D.A.
worry about it.

35:54.820 --> 35:57.420
Sergeant, we got a fresh one!

36:13.238 --> 36:15.405
GREEVEY:
Harv Beigel.

36:30.389 --> 36:33.190
Your witness, Counselor.

36:41.233 --> 36:43.366
and conspiracy to commit
murder in the second degree.

36:43.368 --> 36:45.302
How do you plead?

36:45.304 --> 36:46.436
Not guilty,
Your Honor.

36:46.438 --> 36:47.537
Motions?

36:47.539 --> 36:49.439
Defense moves
that this court

36:49.441 --> 36:51.441
lacks jurisdiction
in this matter, Your Honor.

36:51.443 --> 36:53.443
A body was found
in New Jersey.

36:53.445 --> 36:56.246
There is nothing to link that
body to New York City.

36:56.248 --> 36:58.281
People contend
that the murder

36:58.283 --> 37:00.684
was committed in New York,
and the body transported.

37:00.686 --> 37:02.586
I'll hear motions in two weeks.

37:02.588 --> 37:04.554
Papers to be submitted
Monday next.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.456
Until that time, Your Honor,
the state requests

37:06.458 --> 37:08.291
that the defendant
be held without bail.

37:08.293 --> 37:09.993
Your Honor...

37:09.995 --> 37:11.328
Save it, Counselor.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.596
This is murder two.

37:12.598 --> 37:13.597
No bail.

37:13.599 --> 37:15.232
Request a hearing.

37:15.234 --> 37:17.567
It's your prerogative.

37:17.569 --> 37:18.935
We have Beigel's body.

37:18.937 --> 37:21.404
We have a positive I.D.
on Mackey's remains.

37:21.406 --> 37:22.973
I have means and motive.

37:22.975 --> 37:25.976
What you don't have is one
irrefutable piece  of evidence

37:25.978 --> 37:28.411
that ties masucci
to either one of those bodies.

37:28.413 --> 37:31.514
Without that, I'm not
gonna let you go to trial.

37:31.516 --> 37:33.416
What kind of evidence
would satisfy you?

37:33.418 --> 37:34.718
A witness would be nice.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.320
You're not giving me
much running room here.

37:37.322 --> 37:38.388
The last time...

37:38.390 --> 37:39.923
This isn't
the last time.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.391
Everyone has
an agenda, my boy,

37:41.393 --> 37:43.360
but I won't let yours
take presidence.

37:43.362 --> 37:46.529
I can't have this office
dragged through the mud again.

37:46.531 --> 37:48.632
No smoking gun, no trial.

37:48.634 --> 37:50.333
I've already told you,
under no circumstances

37:50.335 --> 37:53.370
will Katherine testify
against her own brother.

37:53.372 --> 37:55.272
Do you actually
think I'm privy

37:55.274 --> 37:57.340
to any aspect
of Frank's life?

37:57.342 --> 37:59.009
I'm a woman, Mr. Stone.

37:59.011 --> 38:01.011
Some traditions never die.

38:01.013 --> 38:02.779
You heard the tape.

38:02.780 --> 38:04.546
I'm only asking you to testify
as to its meaning--

38:04.549 --> 38:07.417
that Frank Masucci ordered
your husband's killing.

38:07.419 --> 38:09.586
Thanks to you,
my husband is dead.

38:09.588 --> 38:11.321
You want me dead, too?

38:11.323 --> 38:13.657
Would Frank Masucci
kill his own sister?

38:13.659 --> 38:16.726
What the hell do you think I was
telling you that day in court?

38:16.728 --> 38:19.396
You got more than
a dozen bodies, for God sake.

38:19.398 --> 38:21.765
What more do you need
to make a case against him?

38:21.767 --> 38:24.401
Please, don't play dumb with me,
Counselor.

38:24.403 --> 38:26.503
We have bodies, we have tapes

38:26.505 --> 38:29.072
we have Harv Beigel's...

38:29.074 --> 38:30.974
In other words
they have nothing.

38:32.444 --> 38:35.745
You can't make
your<i> prima facie</i> case.

38:35.747 --> 38:38.682
I grew up in courtrooms,
Mr. Stone

38:38.684 --> 38:40.717
on my father's knee.

38:40.719 --> 38:42.719
Well, then you're right.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.721
Without your testimony,
we're on thin ice.

38:44.723 --> 38:46.990
So, I'll just put you
on the stand,

38:46.992 --> 38:48.625
with or without your permission,

38:48.627 --> 38:50.393
and treat you
as a hostile witness.

38:50.395 --> 38:53.063
You can subpeona her, but you
can't force her to testify.

38:53.065 --> 38:55.699
You might want to remind
Mr. Leclaire

38:55.701 --> 38:59.402
what the penalties are
for contempt and perjury.

38:59.404 --> 39:00.603
Please, Mr. Stone

39:00.605 --> 39:02.706
don't put me in this position.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.774
I have small children.

39:07.979 --> 39:10.513
And I have no choice.

39:10.515 --> 39:11.681
Sorry.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.720
I have my witness, Adam.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.555
I'm ready
to go to trial.

39:18.557 --> 39:20.040
Her lawyer's right--

39:20.041 --> 39:21.524
you can't compel her
to tell the truth.

39:21.526 --> 39:24.394
Once she's on the stand,
she will tell the truth.

39:24.396 --> 39:25.695
I see-- now you're
psychic, huh?

39:25.697 --> 39:27.997
You realize she'd have
to violate every rule

39:27.999 --> 39:29.399
she ever grew up with.

39:29.401 --> 39:30.734
Her brother
threw the rule book out

39:30.736 --> 39:32.035
when he killed
her husband.

39:32.037 --> 39:33.503
All right,
you met the woman.

39:33.505 --> 39:35.505
You want to put your faith
in her character,

39:35.507 --> 39:36.473
I won't
second-guess you.

39:36.475 --> 39:37.474
We have a problem.

39:37.476 --> 39:38.708
Masucci's
just been bailed out.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.844
Just been... What?
By who?

39:40.846 --> 39:42.512
You sure he's here?

39:42.514 --> 39:43.713
He's doing
arraignments.

39:43.715 --> 39:44.781
Lonner!

39:44.783 --> 39:46.449
Don't move!

39:50.822 --> 39:52.622
Sure, I knew
Masucci's bail hearing

39:52.624 --> 39:54.023
wasn't scheduled
until Thursday

39:54.025 --> 39:57.060
but his attorney brought it
by order to show cause.

39:57.062 --> 39:58.595
You should
have called me.

39:58.597 --> 39:59.696
I tried

39:59.698 --> 40:02.165
but Judge Overmeyer
gave me ten minutes.

40:02.167 --> 40:03.884
He said
no adjournments.

40:03.885 --> 40:05.602
So Masucci's out on bail,
what's the big deal?

40:05.604 --> 40:06.669
Where's he gonna go?

40:06.671 --> 40:08.438
Look, his sister
was standing there

40:08.440 --> 40:10.173
with a check
for a million bucks...

40:10.175 --> 40:12.809
Katherine Beigel
posted his bail?

40:12.811 --> 40:14.144
Yeah.

40:15.414 --> 40:16.546
Overmeyer.

40:16.548 --> 40:18.582
Connected?

40:18.583 --> 40:20.617
The largest contributor
to his campaign fund

40:20.619 --> 40:22.752
is New York Cement.
You figure it out.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.170
Why would
Katherine Beigel..?

40:24.171 --> 40:25.587
I don't want to speculate.
Find her.

40:25.590 --> 40:28.858
Call Cragen and tell them
to pick up Masucci.

40:28.860 --> 40:29.859
On what?

40:29.861 --> 40:31.528
I don't give a damn.

40:31.530 --> 40:33.530
For spitting on the sidewalk.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.098
Ben...
<i> Now,</i> Paul.

40:37.502 --> 40:40.603
LOGAN:
<i> for your husband's arrest.</i>

40:40.605 --> 40:41.704
Again?!

40:41.706 --> 40:42.872
He just got out.

40:42.874 --> 40:45.108
What could he have done
in five hours?

40:45.110 --> 40:47.377
(<i> children making</i>
<i> gunfire noises</i> )

40:47.378 --> 40:49.645
David, take your brother
to his room right now!

40:49.648 --> 40:50.847
Cute kids.

40:50.849 --> 40:52.649
When they're asleep.

40:52.651 --> 40:55.652
Let's see, Frank said
something about...

40:55.654 --> 40:57.654
some meetings...

40:57.656 --> 41:00.223
Try the social club downtown.

41:00.225 --> 41:02.725
That's where
he keeps his office

41:02.727 --> 41:05.728
but I suppose
you already know that.

41:05.730 --> 41:07.197
When does he usually come home?

41:07.199 --> 41:10.166
8:00, unless
he has a business dinner.

41:10.168 --> 41:12.168
He likes to kiss
the boys good night.

41:12.170 --> 41:14.404
Can I ask you
something?

41:14.405 --> 41:16.639
What exactly does your husband
do for a living?

41:16.641 --> 41:18.107
Investments.

41:18.109 --> 41:19.909
Oh. I thought so.

41:26.952 --> 41:28.919
One and a half more kids

41:28.920 --> 41:30.887
they'd be on the cover
of<i> Life</i> magazine.

41:30.889 --> 41:32.255
Perfect American family.

41:32.257 --> 41:34.524
Masucci had
another kid, a boy.

41:34.526 --> 41:37.527
Jumped a red light
in his convertible

41:37.529 --> 41:39.529
ran square
into a pickup.

41:39.531 --> 41:40.563
D.O.A.

41:40.565 --> 41:42.565
Funny, the driver
of the pickup

41:42.567 --> 41:45.535
walked away
without a scratch.

41:45.537 --> 41:46.703
What's funny about that?

41:46.705 --> 41:48.571
He died
two months later.

41:48.573 --> 41:50.540
Drowned at
Atlantic beach.

41:50.542 --> 41:52.609
Couldn't swim?

41:52.611 --> 41:54.878
Couldn't get out
of his truck.

41:56.515 --> 41:58.214
Perfect.

41:59.184 --> 42:00.517
Frank Masucci.

42:00.519 --> 42:02.519
This is
a private club.

42:02.521 --> 42:03.620
You just went public.

42:03.622 --> 42:05.522
Mind if
we take a look?

42:05.524 --> 42:07.824
Take it easy, fellas.
I haven't seen Frank all day.

42:07.826 --> 42:10.827
Pardon me if I think
you're full of it.

42:10.829 --> 42:12.829
I thought
youse arrested him.

42:12.831 --> 42:14.831
Did he beat youse
already?

42:14.833 --> 42:16.533
We miss his company.

42:16.535 --> 42:18.602
Where's the office?

42:18.603 --> 42:20.670
Listen, guys, I don't know
what youse talking about.

42:20.672 --> 42:22.572
You can show us now

42:22.574 --> 42:25.008
or we arrest you
for obstruction

42:25.010 --> 42:26.876
and then you show us.

42:26.878 --> 42:28.211
All right.

42:29.247 --> 42:30.647
Now, now, Max.

42:30.649 --> 42:31.948
Be social.

42:33.885 --> 42:36.953
What are you
looking at, huh?

42:38.990 --> 42:41.624
Like I said,
he ain't here.

42:42.994 --> 42:46.896
You got something more
than an arrest warrant, or what?

42:46.898 --> 42:48.898
What are you,
a lawyer now?

42:48.900 --> 42:51.601
Where are we likely
to find Big Frank?

42:51.603 --> 42:53.336
Why don't you try the Met.

42:53.338 --> 42:55.772
Hey, try this!
Take it easy, take it easy.

42:55.774 --> 42:57.907
It's dinnertime.

42:57.909 --> 42:59.008
And?

42:59.010 --> 43:01.244
Try La Stanza.

43:13.592 --> 43:14.991
Mike.

43:23.768 --> 43:25.868
You know
what kills me?

43:25.870 --> 43:29.238
These guys, they ride
around in their limos...

43:29.240 --> 43:30.873
they eat lobster...

43:30.875 --> 43:33.843
they wear
vicuna coats...

43:36.081 --> 43:39.382
LOGAN:
Should we let him
eat first?

43:39.384 --> 43:42.085
While we freeze
our asses off out here?

43:42.087 --> 43:43.953
Frankie?

43:56.935 --> 44:00.703
LOGAN:
We got a shooting
on Barrow and Commerce.

44:00.705 --> 44:01.804
Two white males

44:01.806 --> 44:04.040
in a gray Cadillac heading west.

44:12.751 --> 44:15.818
(<i> indistinct radio chatter</i> )

44:28.433 --> 44:30.967
14 shots
from under ten feet.

44:30.969 --> 44:33.069
Somebody wanted
to make sure.

44:33.071 --> 44:36.005
Who do you think
that somebody was?

44:36.007 --> 44:38.007
Katherine Beigel posted his bail

44:38.009 --> 44:41.744
then hopped a plane to Miami
two hours ago.

44:41.746 --> 44:44.380
She posted a million bucks
just to waste him?

44:44.382 --> 44:46.783
It was no waste, it was bail.

44:46.785 --> 44:47.917
With Masucci dead

44:47.919 --> 44:50.053
she gets
every penny back.

44:50.055 --> 44:53.423
Yeah, well, she did
in ten seconds

44:53.425 --> 44:56.392
what we couldn't do
in ten years.

44:56.394 --> 44:57.860
What's that?

44:57.862 --> 45:01.397
Put Masucci out of business...

45:01.399 --> 45:03.066
permanently.

45:09.841 --> 45:11.908
(<i> audience applauding</i> )

45:11.910 --> 45:14.010
Any civilians hurt?

45:14.012 --> 45:15.912
Only the bad guys.

45:15.914 --> 45:17.447
Two in critical.

45:17.449 --> 45:19.415
You know what
this means.

45:19.417 --> 45:21.951
Bodies will fall.

45:21.952 --> 45:24.486
It's a Gambino war of succession
all over again.

45:24.489 --> 45:27.724
Between whoever is stupid enough
to want Masucci's job.

45:27.726 --> 45:29.926
Who do we go after first?

45:29.928 --> 45:33.896
Let's see who's left standing
in a month.

45:33.898 --> 45:39.102
Adam, this is not what I wanted.

45:39.104 --> 45:41.104
I got no complaints.

45:41.106 --> 45:43.439
Let's go tell the mayor.

45:54.419 --> 45:54.450
(<i> applauding</i> )
