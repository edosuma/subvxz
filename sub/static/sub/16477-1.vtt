WEBVTT

00:03.571 --> 00:05.439
*

00:39.207 --> 00:41.342
One of my coworkers
is at the bar.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.278
Miguel.

00:44.312 --> 00:46.280
I know, I know.
No, Miguel.

00:46.314 --> 00:48.416
I know.
No, I know.
You promised.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.184
No police work
tonight.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.352
I'll make it
super quick.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.586
(sighs)

00:52.620 --> 00:53.821
Like, super quick.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.689
Like, I'll just go
and be like, "Hey."

00:55.723 --> 00:57.125
High-five.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.127
(sighs)

00:59.160 --> 01:00.761
Real quick.
Two seconds.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.296
I'm just gonna...

01:02.330 --> 01:03.797
(snaps fingers, pops lips)

01:09.537 --> 01:11.605
You're my angel.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.274
You know that,
right, Elena?

01:15.376 --> 01:18.212
Say it.
I'm your angel.

01:18.246 --> 01:19.613
Good. Oof, that wasn't
so hard, right?

01:19.647 --> 01:21.449
Mm.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.689
Hey.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.391
They'll let anyone in here, huh?

01:31.825 --> 01:33.427
(both chuckle)

01:33.461 --> 01:35.463
Hey, I'm gonna
get you a drink.
No.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.731
No, I'm here
on business.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.333
Oh. Well...

01:39.367 --> 01:40.434
Must be important
if the captain

01:40.468 --> 01:41.769
is sending you out
this late.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.404
Not the captain.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.306
Mr. Silva sent me.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.741
He wanted to express
his condolences

01:47.775 --> 01:50.344
about your sister
back in the U.S.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.647
And since you're a lying
American agent,

01:53.681 --> 01:55.316
she dies tonight.

02:01.189 --> 02:03.123
(grunts)

02:06.427 --> 02:07.795
(choking)
Shh.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.197
Shh.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.232
(groaning)
It's okay,
it's okay.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.533
(laughing)

02:12.566 --> 02:14.402
I'm not gonna tell
your mom, okay?

02:14.435 --> 02:15.636
(laughing)

02:15.669 --> 02:18.272
Oh, hey, can we get him
a little water, please?

02:18.306 --> 02:20.474
Gracias.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.717
*

02:29.750 --> 02:31.719
AMANDA:
Commander, it's just a concert.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.587
What's the big deal?
You're too young.

02:33.621 --> 02:36.390
This is so unfair;
all my friends get to go.

02:36.424 --> 02:38.226
Look, when you turn 18,
you're free to see

02:38.259 --> 02:39.593
as many boy bands
as you want.

02:39.627 --> 02:42.830
Dad, "The 1975"
is not a boy band.

02:42.863 --> 02:45.399
Oh, my God! Could you two
be any more uncool?

02:45.433 --> 02:47.868
The teenage years
are upon us.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.670
Lucia?

02:49.703 --> 02:51.439
Huh?

02:51.472 --> 02:52.740
Did you say something?

02:52.773 --> 02:54.408
Is everything okay?

02:54.442 --> 02:56.910
You've been quiet
all night.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.612
No, it's fine;
it's just work.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.448
(car beeping)

03:00.481 --> 03:02.483
The car's
acting up again.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.785
What? Wait a minute.
What's...?

03:04.818 --> 03:06.287
AMANDA:
Fire!

03:06.320 --> 03:07.388
(screams) Oh!

03:15.696 --> 03:17.698
(horn blaring)

03:23.704 --> 03:24.972
Amanda!

03:25.005 --> 03:27.207
Oh, my God, Amanda!

03:28.476 --> 03:30.210
(grunts)

03:31.379 --> 03:32.646
It's gonna be okay.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.882
It's gonna be okay.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.450
GEORGE:
Help.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.319
LUCIA:
George.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.920
George!

03:47.428 --> 03:49.430
*

04:22.696 --> 04:24.765
Good morning.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.001
That's my robe.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.070
Yes, it is.
Mine is in the wash.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.474
Was either wear this
or go au naturale.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.944
You know...

04:36.977 --> 04:40.448
I am in love
with this new sofa.

04:40.481 --> 04:44.452
It's like being hugged
by a microfiber cloud.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.354
I wouldn't know.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.356
I haven't been able
to sit in it yet.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.690
Oh.

04:51.659 --> 04:52.793
Do you have
physical therapy?

04:52.826 --> 04:54.428
I rescheduled.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.430
You can't get better
if you don't put in the work.

04:56.464 --> 04:59.433
Thank you for those sage words,
Confucius,

04:59.467 --> 05:00.634
but I have been doing
the work every day,

05:00.668 --> 05:02.470
all day, for the
past 12 weeks.

05:02.503 --> 05:03.837
I just thought
with, uh,

05:03.871 --> 05:05.773
Em at school,
I could take a few "me" days.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.510
One day.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.912
Hey, you know, I read
in this month's Cosmo

05:11.945 --> 05:14.615
that compromise

05:14.648 --> 05:18.051
is the key to maintaining
a successful relationship.

05:19.587 --> 05:20.954
It was in my doctor's
waiting room.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.591
Ah.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.759
While you're out,
would you get some milk?

05:25.793 --> 05:27.595
And some more cereal?

05:27.628 --> 05:28.629
(door closes)

05:28.662 --> 05:31.465
Thank you.

05:31.499 --> 05:34.735
(sighs)

05:34.768 --> 05:36.537
Guess who's back?

05:36.570 --> 05:37.771
McGEE:
Bishop!

05:37.805 --> 05:39.473
Welcome back.

05:39.507 --> 05:40.574
Thanks, Tim.

05:40.608 --> 05:41.975
(chuckles)

05:42.009 --> 05:44.445
How was Scotland?
Amazing.

05:44.478 --> 05:47.648
The Lochs, the Glens,
the Isle of Skye.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.782
I even met up
with Clayton Reeves

05:48.816 --> 05:50.751
for a few days.
Oh, yeah, how was that?

05:50.784 --> 05:53.487
Eye opening.
His stamina is incredible.

05:53.521 --> 05:54.788
Couldn't keep up.

05:54.822 --> 05:57.558
Hiking, Tim. Hiking.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.493
Right.

05:59.527 --> 06:03.030
So, you haven't settled in
to the new desk yet?

06:03.063 --> 06:05.533
(sighs) You know,
I'm-I'm still trying

06:05.566 --> 06:06.834
to adjust to the layout.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.402
I mean, you know,
everything's reversed.

06:08.436 --> 06:10.538
The monitors, the phone,
partition even.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.872
It's like Bizarro
World, you know?

06:11.905 --> 06:14.408
TERRY:
Unbelievable!

06:14.442 --> 06:16.877
You know, I came into this
with an open mind.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.980
Turns out, those stories about
Gibbs weren't exaggerated.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.516
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

06:22.550 --> 06:23.817
McGEE:
Bishop, meet...

06:23.851 --> 06:24.985
Special Agent Terry Mahler.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.455
He is our newest probie.
Not anymore.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.890
Gibbs just fired me.
Can you believe that?

06:29.923 --> 06:32.593
Actually, I can, yeah. You
fell asleep at work, twice.

06:32.626 --> 06:37.698
Chronic exhaustion is a
legitimate medical condition.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.700
I require two to
three naps a day.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.768
Now, if you'll
excuse me...

06:40.801 --> 06:42.703
(phone plays lullaby melody)

06:42.736 --> 06:44.472
...it's time for my 8:15-er.

06:44.505 --> 06:47.675
Hmm. So how long
did this one last?

06:47.708 --> 06:48.842
Four days.
Hmm.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.010
Grab your gear.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.579
Let's go!

06:51.612 --> 06:53.914
We got a dead commander
in Alexandria.

06:53.947 --> 06:56.049
Welcome back, Bishop.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.085
Good to be back, Gibbs.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.187
(camera clicking)

07:00.220 --> 07:01.955
After enjoying Phnom Penh,

07:01.989 --> 07:05.493
it was on to the temple
at Angkor Wat.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.761
Yeah. It's as
spectacular today

07:07.795 --> 07:09.997
as it was all those
many moons ago.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.632
What brought on
this desire

07:11.665 --> 07:13.567
to revisit all your
old haunts, Doctor?

07:13.601 --> 07:16.103
I'm chronicling
my life's work, Mr. Palmer.

07:16.136 --> 07:19.673
Yes. I-I need to write down
all those precious moments

07:19.707 --> 07:21.842
before... before I forget them.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.877
Certain things
I'd like to forget.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.946
Like in high school,
when I waxed my legs

07:25.979 --> 07:28.482
to give me that
extra swimmer's edge.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.718
I still came in last.

07:30.751 --> 07:33.887
Perhaps that's a chapter
you should leave out.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.723
Yeah.

07:35.756 --> 07:36.857
What do we know?

07:36.890 --> 07:38.692
McGEE:
We got the Campbell family,

07:38.726 --> 07:41.061
driving home from a party
at the base officer's club

07:41.094 --> 07:43.130
when fire erupted
from inside the vehicle,

07:43.163 --> 07:45.699
causing them to swerve
off the road, crash here.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.968
BISHOP:
Marine Major Lucia Campbell

07:48.001 --> 07:50.070
was able to pull herself
and her daughter from the wreck.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.872
They were taken
to a local hospital.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.241
Unfortunately,
her husband,

07:54.274 --> 07:55.743
Navy Commander
George Campbell,

07:55.776 --> 07:57.978
was trapped inside
when it exploded.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.880
You got a cause of the fire?
McGEE: Well, it's hard to say.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.115
The vehicle's a hybrid.
According to my research...

08:02.149 --> 08:03.784
Shush with your research,
McGee.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.253
The hybrid's battery
is not to blame.

08:06.286 --> 08:08.789
Do you know what a rarity
this is?

08:08.822 --> 08:12.660
A hybrid vehicle exploding
because of a faulty battery?

08:12.693 --> 08:14.227
I thought you said the
battery wasn't to blame.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.764
Well, it is and it isn't.

08:16.797 --> 08:19.266
This compartment
has been tampered with.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.168
Someone at that party

08:21.201 --> 08:23.804
turned this car
into a ticking time bomb.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.551
(spraying air)

08:41.622 --> 08:43.557
(clears throat)

08:45.726 --> 08:46.960
Get it all?

08:46.994 --> 08:49.930
Dust, boss. It's a keyboard's
worst enemy.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.333
Give me an update.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.869
BISHOP: Well, our victim is
Navy Commander George Campbell.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.204
Worked in logistics
at the Pentagon.

08:57.237 --> 09:00.207
While his C.O. described him
as a man without enemies,

09:00.240 --> 09:02.610
the same cannot be said
for his wife,

09:02.643 --> 09:05.212
Marine Major
Lucia Campbell.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.780
McGEE:
Works as a prosecutor

09:06.814 --> 09:08.949
for the Judge Advocate
General here in D.C.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.884
And she's got
numerous convictions,

09:10.918 --> 09:13.320
so makes for a pretty
long list of suspects.
What's her condition?

09:13.353 --> 09:14.955
Well, she suffered
a concussion in the explosion,

09:14.988 --> 09:16.924
still hasn't regained
consciousness.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.892
BISHOP: However, their daughter
only received minor injuries.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.661
She's being held
for observation.

09:20.694 --> 09:23.664
(clapping)

09:23.697 --> 09:25.098
Gibbs.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.334
I came to offer
my congratulations.

09:27.367 --> 09:30.237
Eight rejected agents
in the last three months.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.639
It's a new record for you.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.240
GIBBS:
Quinn. Long time no see.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.175
How ya been?
I've been better.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.243
I bet you know why.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.011
Aha.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.213
Bishop, find out
what Amanda knows.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.015
McGee, check with JAG.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.984
Campbell's cases,
past and present.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.152
Let's take a walk.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.854
Can't wait.

09:48.188 --> 09:51.992
How is life at FLETC?

09:52.025 --> 09:53.761
Same old, same old.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.196
Eat, sleep,
train probies.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.798
Repeat.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.199
I'll tell you,

09:59.232 --> 10:01.702
they're lucky to have you
as an instructor.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.003
Really?

10:03.036 --> 10:05.372
Well, you could have fooled me.

10:05.405 --> 10:08.241
Every agent I send you,
you reject.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.644
None were the right fit.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.412
(sighs) Okay.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.215
Well, uh, one was too smart.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.184
One was too slow,
one was too physical.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.418
One was too timid.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.354
You're like the Goldilocks
of NCIS.

10:21.388 --> 10:24.391
Why don't you just tell me
what it is you're looking for?

10:24.424 --> 10:25.993
I'll know it when I see it.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.728
As helpful as that is,

10:27.761 --> 10:29.329
I'm gonna need a little bit
more information

10:29.362 --> 10:31.298
if you want me to do my job.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.333
Okay.

10:33.366 --> 10:34.802
Why don't you stick around.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.336
Shadow the team.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.806
See firsthand what kind
of an agent we need here.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.340
(sighs)

10:40.373 --> 10:42.876
You never make things easy,
do you?

10:42.910 --> 10:45.312
What's the fun in that?

10:45.345 --> 10:49.416
AMANDA: The last thing
that I remember, I was...

10:49.449 --> 10:50.483
(monitor beeping steadily)

10:50.517 --> 10:54.387
...I was, I was listening
to music, and then...

10:54.421 --> 10:56.890
there was a fire.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.325
And I woke up here.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.329
Amanda, was everything
okay at home?

11:02.362 --> 11:05.165
Ever since she got back
from her trip last week,

11:05.198 --> 11:07.334
she's been quiet.

11:07.367 --> 11:10.137
And the Major
is never quiet.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.404
What trip was she on?

11:11.438 --> 11:13.406
It was for work.

11:13.440 --> 11:17.444
She said she had a...
a lead on some case.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.046
I didn't ask.

11:21.414 --> 11:24.351
Yesterday, I had both
my parents.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.222
I want to go back.

11:34.494 --> 11:35.763
Captain Roberts.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.464
How are ya?
Been a while.

11:37.497 --> 11:40.433
It has, Agent McGee.
Good to see you.
You, too.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.302
Is, uh, Gibbs
tough as ever?
Even more so.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.805
Yeah, how are, uh, Harm
and Mac, how are they doing?

11:44.838 --> 11:46.306
(chuckles) Actually,
it's really interesting.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.175
Okay, so, Harm...
(door opens)

11:48.208 --> 11:50.978
Oh, don't mind me, okay.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.447
Captain, this is Agent Quinn.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.750
Pleasure.
Pretend I'm not here.

11:58.518 --> 12:01.421
So how long had Major Campbell
been working at JAG?

12:01.454 --> 12:04.191
Uh, Lucia has been with us
for about four years.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.227
And she is one of the best
prosecutors I've ever seen.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.897
So it would be safe to say
she ruffled a few feathers?

12:09.930 --> 12:11.965
Well, we're lawyers,
Agent McGee.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.466
It's sort of what we do.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.768
(Quinn laughs)

12:14.802 --> 12:16.436
That's a good one.

12:16.469 --> 12:17.437
Sorry.

12:17.470 --> 12:18.772
I like this guy.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.475
She express any concerns
about her safety?

12:22.509 --> 12:24.978
If she had, I would have
contacted NCIS immediately.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.980
And the work
trip last week,

12:27.014 --> 12:28.115
what lead was she
following up on?

12:28.148 --> 12:30.383
Uh, there was no work trip.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.920
Major Campbell had asked
for some personal leave time.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.121
She said that she had
a private matter

12:34.154 --> 12:35.322
that she had to attend to.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.260
Why would she lie about it
to her family?

12:41.829 --> 12:43.864
Mr. Palmer...

12:45.598 --> 12:47.167
...how much time will

12:47.200 --> 12:50.337
this extracurricular
assignment of yours take?

12:50.370 --> 12:54.474
I would like my exam room
back to its original state.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.243
My apologies,
Dr. Mallard.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.444
It's just, digitizing

12:57.477 --> 13:00.013
all of these archived
NCIS autopsy records

13:00.047 --> 13:03.183
is taking a bit longer
than expected.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.052
On the plus side though,
this has given me

13:05.085 --> 13:08.255
a near-encyclopedic
knowledge of our past.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.023
Well, shall I put you
to the test?

13:10.057 --> 13:11.424
Hit me.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.160
August 1988,

13:13.193 --> 13:14.494
Chief Lawrence Dunphy.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.330
Uh, Navy diver,
found in Virginia Beach,

13:17.364 --> 13:19.066
shot through the heart
with his own harpoon gun.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.068
(laughs) Very good.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.270
Not for Chief Dunphy. Ouch.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.504
What do ya got, Duck?

13:24.537 --> 13:27.040
Revisiting past cases,
Jethro.

13:27.074 --> 13:28.541
I'd rather know
about the present.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.277
Well, the results of

13:30.310 --> 13:33.180
Commander Campbell's
examination were as expected.

13:33.213 --> 13:37.918
Cause of death: massive trauma
inflicted by the explosion.

13:37.951 --> 13:41.021
However, Mr. Palmer
discovered something

13:41.054 --> 13:43.623
which might
prove relevant.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.525
According to the hospital
records for his wife,

13:45.558 --> 13:47.094
Major Lucia Campbell,

13:47.127 --> 13:50.563
there was a neurotoxin
found in her blood draw.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.901
The chemical composition
corresponds to the venom

13:53.934 --> 13:55.502
of the Latrodectus
corallinus.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.872
That's a species
of black widow spider

13:58.906 --> 14:01.308
native to Argentina.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.510
JIMMY: And according to the
amount found in her system,

14:03.543 --> 14:04.978
she was bitten recently.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.547
Like, within the last two weeks
recently.

14:07.580 --> 14:11.551
So, what was Major Campbell
doing in Argentina?

14:11.584 --> 14:12.619
(phone rings)

14:12.652 --> 14:14.054
Hello.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.355
I'm on my way up.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.159
Give me another one.
(laughs)

14:19.192 --> 14:20.393
Agent Quinn, you know,
I don't know

14:20.427 --> 14:21.394
if you remember this at all,

14:21.428 --> 14:23.163
but you were actually
one of my instructors

14:23.196 --> 14:24.497
when I first
joined NCIS.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.333
You used to love mystery novels.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.036
Used to carry a paperback
around in your bag.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.570
Look at this.

14:30.603 --> 14:31.638
Still do.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.340
Yeah, I never forget a student.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.908
BISHOP:
That's amazing.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.076
What do you remember about me?

14:39.412 --> 14:41.881
I'm sorry,
what's your name again?

14:42.615 --> 14:43.650
Ellie Bishop.

14:43.683 --> 14:46.186
I was at FLETC
two years ago.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.654
During breaks,
I sat on the floor

14:47.687 --> 14:49.189
near the vending machines
on my laptop.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.691
I'm sorry, I'm drawing a blank.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.193
GIBBS:
What do ya got?

14:53.226 --> 14:55.595
Uh, Nick Torres,
Lucia Campbell's

14:55.628 --> 14:58.365
younger brother
and an NCIS agent.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.301
I don't know him.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.702
Torres's name
didn't register earlier

15:02.735 --> 15:04.304
'cause he's
a deep-cover agent.

15:04.337 --> 15:05.505
As you know,
their identities

15:05.538 --> 15:06.606
and records are sealed
by the director.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.308
How'd we find out
he was an agent?

15:08.341 --> 15:10.010
'Cause I recognized him.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.579
I trained him eight years ago
when he joined with the Agency.

15:12.612 --> 15:13.546
Never forget a student.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.182
Uh, most of the time.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.250
I'm not surprised
he ended up in undercover.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.318
He was unattached,

15:18.351 --> 15:20.253
he was persuasive,

15:20.287 --> 15:22.189
he was clever,
a bit unstable.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.991
You just described a sociopath.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.258
Yeah, but only the good kind.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.659
Mm, that's not a thing.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.461
Where is Torres now?

15:28.495 --> 15:30.630
Vanished six months ago
while on assignment.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.632
After her younger brother
was presumed dead,

15:32.665 --> 15:35.302
Lucia wanted answers; she hired
a private investigator.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.337
According to the e-mails
found on her home computer,

15:37.370 --> 15:40.673
the P.I. followed the trail
to Buenos Aires and sent her

15:40.707 --> 15:42.675
this surveillance photo.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.677
Gibbs...

15:44.711 --> 15:45.612
this image is recent.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.015
Agent Torres is alive.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.229
I ever tell you
I met him once?

16:02.262 --> 16:04.497
I was attending
a meeting at the Willard.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.599
He was in town
visiting the president.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.068
Man knew things.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.270
So do you, Leon.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.172
Special Agent Nick Torres.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.506
It's "need to know."

16:13.540 --> 16:15.075
Yeah, well, I need to know.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.743
Just like that?

16:16.776 --> 16:18.611
Yeah, if it affects a case,
just like that.

16:21.381 --> 16:24.351
Agent Torres is one of the
best undercover ops we got.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.286
He's deep for a reason.

16:26.319 --> 16:29.456
2014, the State Department
needed an agent to surveil

16:29.489 --> 16:32.292
the Global Enforcement
Academy. You familiar?

16:32.325 --> 16:34.094
Yeah, training centers.
Right.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.129
Taught by U.S. agents
abroad to educate

16:36.163 --> 16:38.398
local law enforcement in
everything from counterterrorism

16:38.431 --> 16:40.033
to human trafficking.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.735
We discovered that a handful
of these trained officers

16:42.769 --> 16:44.604
were being scouted
as mercenaries.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.139
Torres went under.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.740
Mm-hmm.

16:47.774 --> 16:51.778
As a student at the
G.E.A. in Argentina,

16:51.811 --> 16:54.147
where he took on
the persona of...

16:54.181 --> 16:57.517
federal officer
Captain Miguel Lorenza.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.819
Until last March, he was
still sending updates.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.821
Then he went
off the grid.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.056
(computer beeps)

17:03.090 --> 17:05.225
Backup found
his apartment scrubbed.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.494
We searched, we waited--
nothing.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.130
State Department told us
to assume the worst.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.631
If Torres is still alive,

17:11.664 --> 17:13.566
why didn't he reach out?
Well, he might've

17:13.600 --> 17:15.335
had to go so deep,
he could've gone rogue.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.536
Or worse.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.338
He switched sides.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.141
Torres's sister went
to Argentina recently

17:21.174 --> 17:22.642
to look for him.

17:22.675 --> 17:26.213
Few days later, somebody plants
a bomb in her car.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.448
That's one hell
of a coincidence.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.719
What class were you in again?

17:32.752 --> 17:34.821
Uh, 2514.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.823
Gundersen, Simoni and Murphy?

17:36.856 --> 17:37.524
Yes!

17:37.557 --> 17:40.393
You sure you were in that class?

17:40.427 --> 17:43.530
Yes. Yes. No, I...
I'm the one who-who...

17:43.563 --> 17:45.732
knocked out the
assailant's front teeth

17:45.765 --> 17:48.135
during a Protective
Operations exercise.

17:48.168 --> 17:51.204
Yeah, everyone started calling
me "The Incisor-nator."

17:51.238 --> 17:52.472
(laughs softly)

17:52.505 --> 17:54.507
No, still doesn't ring a bell.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.109
Seriously?

17:56.143 --> 17:56.876
(inhales sharply)

17:56.909 --> 17:59.246
(sighs):
I need a snack.

17:59.279 --> 18:02.149
(chuckles softly)

18:02.182 --> 18:03.283
(groans)

18:04.317 --> 18:06.119
I saw that.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.288
Oh, yeah? You saw what?

18:08.321 --> 18:10.323
You do remember her.
Course I do.

18:10.357 --> 18:13.626
Bishop is not a personality
that you easily forget.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.662
So why are you messing with her?

18:15.695 --> 18:18.131
Oh, because
she's so tightly wound.

18:18.165 --> 18:20.633
She needs to loosen up
a little bit.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.835
Plus, it tickles me.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.172
Still messing with Bishop?

18:25.205 --> 18:26.439
It's too easy not to.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.141
(computer beeps)

18:28.175 --> 18:30.777
Boss, just got a BOLO hit on one
of Torres's undercover aliases.

18:30.810 --> 18:31.544
Where?

18:33.846 --> 18:36.216
McGEE: It's here in D.C.
Landed at Dulles International

18:36.249 --> 18:38.651
from Buenos Aires
15 minutes ago.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.553
WOMAN (over speakers):
Next stop, Union Station.

18:40.587 --> 18:43.423
Final stop
on the Dulles Airport shuttle.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.366
You're a long way from Buenos
Aires, Captain Lorenzo!

18:53.400 --> 18:55.268
(grunting)

19:03.443 --> 19:05.178
(groans)

19:05.212 --> 19:06.279
(gunshot)

19:14.654 --> 19:16.189
NCIS!
Drop it!

19:28.000 --> 19:30.337
Special Agent Torres.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.671
Relax.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.306
We're on the same side.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.574
Are we?

19:34.607 --> 19:36.576
(siren approaching)

19:36.609 --> 19:39.212
VANCE:
Your mission was

19:39.246 --> 19:42.349
to suss out any corruption
within U.S.-sanctioned training.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.417
Which is what I was doing
successfully at G.E.A.

19:44.451 --> 19:45.752
for the past year and a half.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.287
Until you fell off the grid.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.656
We thought
you were dead.
But that is the point.

19:51.258 --> 19:53.460
What the hell happened
in Argentina?

19:53.493 --> 19:55.462
Well...

19:55.495 --> 19:58.465
while I was undercover
as a trainee, Miguel Lorenza,

19:58.498 --> 20:00.900
I was befriended
by a classmate.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.670
David Silva.

20:05.004 --> 20:07.540
He was the best of the best
at the academy.

20:07.574 --> 20:10.510
A crack shot
with an affinity for explosives.

20:11.844 --> 20:13.346
He is the son...

20:13.380 --> 20:16.015
of Leo Silva,
a South American businessman

20:16.048 --> 20:18.885
who made a fortune
off the Argentinean oil boom.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.587
That's not where he started.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.022
How do you know him, Gibbs?

20:23.055 --> 20:24.624
Mike Franks.

20:24.657 --> 20:27.660
NIS investigated Silva
for crooked business deals

20:27.694 --> 20:30.863
with military vendors
in Cartagena.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.732
And what's Silva's play
with G.E.A.?

20:32.765 --> 20:34.367
He's recruiting mercenaries,

20:34.401 --> 20:36.403
scouted out by his son.

20:36.436 --> 20:40.307
Extortion, tampering
with evidence, even hired hits.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.475
Anything to keep his name clean.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.277
GIBBS:
M.O. hasn't changed much.

20:44.311 --> 20:46.313
Mike never could
get a charge to stick.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.047
Because he keeps his
operation in-house,

20:48.080 --> 20:49.882
which is why
I had to go rogue.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.384
To infiltrate his inner circle.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.286
How?

20:55.087 --> 20:57.790
TORRES: I started a relationship
with his daughter.

20:59.326 --> 20:59.926
Elena.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.796
As time passed,

21:03.830 --> 21:05.465
he began to trust me
as one of his own.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.500
He told me
they were in the midst

21:07.534 --> 21:08.935
of planning
something big,

21:08.968 --> 21:10.470
and soon.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.071
And before
I could find out what,

21:12.104 --> 21:14.073
well, my sister showed up to
Buenos Aires asking questions.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.343
She blew your cover.
Yeah.

21:16.376 --> 21:19.412
Figured that out when I was
jumped by one of his men.

21:20.813 --> 21:23.082
I came here
to warn Lucia,

21:23.115 --> 21:25.818
but I was too late.

21:25.852 --> 21:28.521
Mission's not over.

21:28.555 --> 21:31.624
BISHOP:
Torres spent eight years

21:31.658 --> 21:33.826
doing nothing but
undercover work.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.528
Why?
QUINN:
Different strokes.

21:35.562 --> 21:39.499
He probably views a desk job
as a fate worse than death.

21:39.532 --> 21:42.068
Me? I get my kicks
screaming at probies.

21:42.101 --> 21:44.837
Yeah, but Torres
is in deep.

21:44.871 --> 21:47.940
Who knows what sort of things he
had to do to maintain his cover?

21:47.974 --> 21:49.576
And then
when the mission ends,

21:49.609 --> 21:51.511
he still has
to carry that with him.

21:51.544 --> 21:54.581
So do you,
and Gibbs and McGee.

21:54.614 --> 21:58.117
Every action we take
has a consequence.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.086
BISHOP:
Hey, did local LEOs

22:00.119 --> 22:01.721
in Buenos Aires
question Leo Silva?

22:01.754 --> 22:02.855
GIBBS:
It doesn't matter.

22:02.889 --> 22:04.691
Silva's here in D.C.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.859
He's attending an event today
connecting North American

22:06.893 --> 22:09.095
oil companies with
their Southern counterparts.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.799
Uh, it's a big deal, Gibbs.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.368
All week, Washington's hosting
a fossil fuel summit.

22:15.402 --> 22:18.405
Bigwigs and politicos
as far as the eye can see.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.807
Boss, Silva got here two days
ago; that is enough time

22:20.840 --> 22:22.642
for him to put out
the hit on the Campbells,

22:22.675 --> 22:24.444
go to the party
and then leave town.

22:24.477 --> 22:25.712
Not until he gets
what he wants.

22:25.745 --> 22:28.381
Which is what?
Me and my family dead.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.083
Let me face him.

22:31.117 --> 22:32.719
That's not how we do things.

22:32.752 --> 22:35.121
Gibbs, I know this man.

22:35.154 --> 22:36.623
I know how he operates.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.458
You cannot sideline me.

22:42.629 --> 22:45.498
Sir.

22:45.532 --> 22:48.000
TORRES:
No bodyguard, Leo?

22:50.570 --> 22:52.572
That's pretty careless of you.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.874
David will be along
any second now.

22:54.907 --> 22:58.044
Happy to see you, Miguel.

22:58.077 --> 23:00.413
Or whatever the hell
your name is.

23:00.447 --> 23:03.049
One day you're at my home,
the next day you're missing.

23:03.082 --> 23:04.517
We were all concerned.

23:04.551 --> 23:06.653
Oh, yeah, those guys
you sent over to kill me--

23:06.686 --> 23:08.488
they-they seemed really worried.

23:08.521 --> 23:11.458
Don't know what you mean.
Cut the crap, Leo.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.192
I'm not here to play
any more games with you.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.193
Is that what this was?

23:14.226 --> 23:15.928
A game?

23:15.962 --> 23:17.730
Is that what I should tell
my daughter?

23:17.764 --> 23:19.532
Elena's inside already.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.868
Perhaps you would like
to tell her that.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.772
I'm not here for her.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.574
I'm here for you.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.776
Well, here I am.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.611
What are you gonna do?

23:31.644 --> 23:34.046
Shoot me in front
of all these witnesses?

23:34.080 --> 23:34.947
Quite the opposite.

23:34.981 --> 23:37.584
Every piece of evidence
I have on you

23:37.617 --> 23:39.218
is on this drive.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.588
NCIS doesn't
know it exists.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.856
You stay away
from me and my family,

23:43.890 --> 23:46.559
and I'll make sure
NCIS never gets anything on you.

23:48.227 --> 23:49.295
Sir.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.067
Special Agent Nick Torres.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.707
You're a dead man,
showing your face here.
(chuckles): See? See?

24:00.740 --> 24:02.609
See, this is the problem.
Your temper-- it's crazy

24:02.642 --> 24:05.578
all the time. David,
you have to be able to separate

24:05.612 --> 24:08.581
your personal feelings
with business.

24:08.615 --> 24:11.150
Father, should I take care
of our uninvited guest?

24:11.183 --> 24:13.052
LEO: Well, since we're
in the middle

24:13.085 --> 24:15.988
of discussing a truce...
Truce?

24:16.022 --> 24:18.190
I don't think
that will be necessary.

24:18.224 --> 24:19.792
After everything he's done?

24:19.826 --> 24:22.028
Pa, don't do this.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.063
He's lying.

24:27.299 --> 24:30.603
I'll consider the offer.

24:32.539 --> 24:33.506
I'll see you later.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.975
Yeah.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.020
FORNELL: We really
got to get a new TV.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.288
Go with the new sofa.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.658
I like my TV.

24:51.691 --> 24:53.926
Get one of those hi-def
curved ones.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.695
(turns TV off)

24:55.728 --> 24:58.097
Read a book.
My eyes get tired.

24:58.130 --> 25:01.133
It's a diagnosed problem
since I got shot.

25:01.167 --> 25:02.935
(doorbell rings)

25:02.969 --> 25:03.936
It's open!

25:03.970 --> 25:05.805
You have a doorbell?

25:07.006 --> 25:08.007
How'd it go?

25:08.040 --> 25:09.609
Well, Silva didn't shoot me.

25:09.642 --> 25:10.677
Sounds promising.

25:12.344 --> 25:15.848
Took everything in my power
not to kill him right there.

25:15.882 --> 25:18.785
Silva take the thumb drive?
Yeah, but there's no
guarantee he'll open it.

25:18.818 --> 25:21.888
Silva wants to know
what you know about him.

25:21.921 --> 25:24.023
He'll look.
FORNELL:
I hate to stick my seasoned

25:24.056 --> 25:27.126
investigatory nose in, but
with all you've got on the guy,

25:27.159 --> 25:28.828
why didn't you just arrest him?

25:28.861 --> 25:30.697
It did cross our minds.

25:30.730 --> 25:33.032
Except my intel on Silva
only implicates him

25:33.065 --> 25:34.734
on crimes committed
in South America,

25:34.767 --> 25:37.036
not the United States.
If extradited to Argentina,

25:37.069 --> 25:39.772
well, he can pull enough
strings to never go to trial.

25:39.806 --> 25:42.108
Well, at least get him
into an interrogation room.

25:42.141 --> 25:43.976
If you know he's planning
something, pull it out of him.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.712
Silva won't crack.

25:45.745 --> 25:48.147
And holding him won't stop
his plan from going forward.

25:48.180 --> 25:51.818
He has enough people doing
his dirty work. Like David.

25:53.019 --> 25:56.122
Good enough for me.

25:58.825 --> 26:01.093
Guest bed's on the right,
top of the stairs.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.295
I... I don't sleep.

26:03.329 --> 26:06.599
Well, you're welcome
to pace around up there.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.768
I got dibs on the couch.

26:08.801 --> 26:11.270
You get your own micro-cloud.

26:18.044 --> 26:22.214
You're really just gonna
stand there and watch me?

26:22.248 --> 26:24.183
It's kind of
the point of shadowing.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.385
Observe, take notes.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.387
Why exactly are you doing this?

26:28.420 --> 26:32.692
Gibbs keeps rejecting
every agent I've sent in.

26:32.725 --> 26:35.728
So, in order to find
an agent that fits,

26:35.762 --> 26:38.164
I need to see why
the others didn't work.

26:38.197 --> 26:41.100
And what have you
surmised so far?

26:41.133 --> 26:42.902
Gibbs is very particular.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.237
He chooses his
team with care.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.373
He doesn't just take
an agent on face value.

26:47.406 --> 26:49.175
There needs to be
something else,

26:49.208 --> 26:51.778
something more that
he sees in them.

26:51.811 --> 26:53.079
Like he saw in you.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.747
Hmm. Which was what?

26:54.781 --> 26:56.916
Same thing
I saw in you.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.050
Potential.

26:58.084 --> 27:00.119
You saw?

27:01.053 --> 27:02.955
You don't even rem...

27:04.223 --> 27:07.259
Huh.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.929
So what do you remember
about me?
Um...

27:09.962 --> 27:12.799
I do remember you were not
the most naturally-skilled

27:12.832 --> 27:15.201
agent I've ever seen.
Maybe I'd rather not know.

27:15.234 --> 27:18.204
But that being said,
you were persistent.

27:18.237 --> 27:22.274
And every time you got knocked
down, you'd get right back up.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.276
And you never made
the same mistake twice.

27:24.310 --> 27:27.714
Well, being a field agent

27:27.747 --> 27:30.416
definitely forced me
out of my comfort zone.

27:30.449 --> 27:32.384
Well, Gibbs made
the right call.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.921
He always does.

27:36.823 --> 27:39.191
You've known Gibbs a long time?
Mm-hmm.

27:39.225 --> 27:42.161
Then you know everything
he does is for a reason.

27:44.196 --> 27:45.732
Hmm.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.770
I'm gonna go and get
some beauty rest.

27:52.772 --> 27:54.273
Night, Bishop.

27:55.307 --> 27:58.177
Night, Quinn.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.713
There anything on the thumb
drive Torres gave to Silva?

28:00.747 --> 28:03.049
Monitoring it, boss. Silva
still hasn't opened it.

28:03.082 --> 28:06.152
Gibbs, there is something
hinky in Hinky Town.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.487
When I first started
processing the Campbells' car,

28:08.520 --> 28:11.223
I was looking for the obvious,
like a small detonator,

28:11.257 --> 28:12.458
or some trigger wires,

28:12.491 --> 28:14.160
but this is way more
sophisticated than that.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.795
Check this out.

28:17.363 --> 28:21.233
Someone shoved a flawed
12-volt battery

28:21.267 --> 28:23.335
into the lithium-ion
compartment.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.772
Like a detonator.
It wasn't like a detonator.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.106
It was a detonator.

28:28.074 --> 28:29.842
(tapping keyboard)

28:29.876 --> 28:33.179
Crack this thing,
add some friction and some heat,

28:33.212 --> 28:35.114
and boom.

28:35.147 --> 28:37.850
This trigger
could have been installed

28:37.884 --> 28:40.319
hours or even days earlier
than we originally thought.

28:40.352 --> 28:43.022
It wasn't anybody
from the officers' club.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.958
No. But whoever did
this, he was smart.

28:45.992 --> 28:47.126
Like, really smart.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.328
Like, Gates-Zuckerberg-Musk
smart.

28:49.361 --> 28:51.998
Only it's not a "he."
Look at this.

28:52.031 --> 28:54.767
Elena Silva studied electrical
engineering with honors

28:54.801 --> 28:56.769
at the University of Sao Paulo.

28:56.803 --> 28:58.971
Also did an
automotive residency

28:59.005 --> 29:00.773
at an experimental
plant in Peru.

29:00.807 --> 29:02.942
She could have easily
known how to turn

29:02.975 --> 29:05.377
the car's battery compartment
into a time bomb, boss.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.880
Hey, Torres, get off your ass.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.348
We need you.

29:14.486 --> 29:17.356
The coffee's better
in Buenos Aires.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.328
Coffee?

29:22.361 --> 29:25.231
That's what you have
to say to me?

29:25.264 --> 29:28.067
I didn't know how to start.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.336
How about by telling
me your name.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.004
Your real name.

29:32.038 --> 29:34.841
My name is Nick Torres.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.909
I'm an NCIS agent.

29:36.943 --> 29:40.079
ELENA (over radio):
Nice to meet you, Agent Torres.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.448
She didn't slug him.
You owe me five bucks.

29:42.481 --> 29:44.316
Understanding ex.

29:44.350 --> 29:46.085
Imagine that.

29:46.118 --> 29:49.188
Left behind some scorned women,
huh, Gibbs?

29:49.221 --> 29:50.990
I have no comment.
Smart man.

29:51.023 --> 29:52.524
I'm keeping the five.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.560
ELENA:
You were a part of our family.

29:54.593 --> 29:57.997
We trusted you.
I trusted you.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.265
How could you lie to me?

29:59.298 --> 30:01.033
I never meant to hurt you,
Elena.

30:01.067 --> 30:02.401
You came after my family.

30:02.434 --> 30:04.336
What are you
talking about?

30:04.370 --> 30:07.339
Car bomb. Was it your idea,
or did David put you put to it?

30:07.373 --> 30:08.908
Of course not!

30:10.409 --> 30:12.278
Is that the kind of
person you think I am?

30:12.311 --> 30:13.112
That's the kind of person

30:13.145 --> 30:14.914
that your brother
and your father are.

30:14.947 --> 30:16.916
Why else do you think
I was investigating them?

30:16.949 --> 30:18.284
They are criminals, Elena.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.952
They're thieves,
they're murderers.

30:19.986 --> 30:21.320
I don't want
to hear this!

30:21.353 --> 30:23.255
Which is why you don't want
to ask any questions.

30:23.289 --> 30:24.390
You're afraid of the truth.

30:27.259 --> 30:29.361
You're wrong.
About everything.

30:29.395 --> 30:31.297
Why don't you ask
your father.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.399
Get to know who he really is.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.310
That went well.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.645
Yeah.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.447
It's about to get worse.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.516
Silva bugged Elena's phone;
he knew we were gonna meet here.

30:50.549 --> 30:52.018
How do you know that?

30:52.051 --> 30:53.452
Because he planted a bomb
under my seat.

30:53.485 --> 30:57.389
I activated the pressure trigger
when I sat down.

31:03.162 --> 31:05.364
And you're waiting until
now to tell me that?

31:05.397 --> 31:07.533
Well... I was in the middle
of something.

31:07.566 --> 31:09.401
(chuckles)

31:09.435 --> 31:11.303
How's it look?

31:11.337 --> 31:13.239
Well, like it might
hurt for a second.
Okay.

31:13.272 --> 31:14.540
You're enjoying this.

31:14.573 --> 31:15.641
Ah, yeah, a little.

31:28.020 --> 31:30.122
It was a setup. Leo and
David knew I'd be there.

31:30.156 --> 31:31.590
They planted that bomb.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.692
He put his own daughter's life
in danger

31:33.725 --> 31:35.928
just to get me.
Well, it stops now.

31:35.962 --> 31:37.496
I understand your frustration,

31:37.529 --> 31:39.966
but you need to stay focused
on the big picture.

31:39.999 --> 31:42.134
The big picture?
The big picture?

31:42.168 --> 31:43.502
The Silvas killed

31:43.535 --> 31:45.604
my brother-in-law,
nearly killed my sister,

31:45.637 --> 31:47.940
and just attempted
to blow my ass up.

31:47.974 --> 31:48.874
Take a breath, Torres.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.043
No, I'm breathing, Gibbs!
I'm breathing.

31:52.511 --> 31:55.314
But I'm done doing things
the official way.

31:55.347 --> 31:58.450
I make those decisions,
Agent Torres.

32:01.988 --> 32:04.523
Eight years of service,
and what has it gotten me?

32:04.556 --> 32:07.159
Huh? A broken family,
a lifetime of lies,

32:07.193 --> 32:09.628
16 different names,
16 different home addresses,

32:09.661 --> 32:12.698
no wife, no kids-- I don't
even know what I want anymore.

32:14.066 --> 32:16.235
I don't even know
who I can trust.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.039
Well...

32:21.373 --> 32:24.010
...I'm stopping the Silvas
on my own.

32:25.177 --> 32:27.946
I work better that way.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.718
You have
something to say?

32:32.751 --> 32:34.753
Yeah. I'm disappointed.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.156
You failed the mission.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.426
You failed to protect
your sister.

32:43.062 --> 32:45.597
You disrespected
the badge.

32:45.631 --> 32:48.767
Revenge on Silva
won't change a thing.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.070
You can trust me on
that, 'cause I know.

32:51.103 --> 32:55.541
You want the last two years of
your life to mean something?

32:55.574 --> 32:59.178
Then you see this
through, the right way.

33:00.346 --> 33:01.780
(knocking)

33:01.813 --> 33:03.549
(door opens)

33:03.582 --> 33:05.417
Sorry to interrupt,
Director, but...

33:05.451 --> 33:07.253
we have a lead on
Silva's target.

33:13.059 --> 33:14.093
(door closes)

33:14.126 --> 33:15.194
McGEE:
The thumb drive

33:15.227 --> 33:18.164
that Torres gave Silva
contained a mirroring virus,

33:18.197 --> 33:20.132
and when Silva plugged
that in to his laptop,

33:20.166 --> 33:22.168
we were able to access
his computer.

33:22.201 --> 33:23.669
Silva was smart
enough not to have

33:23.702 --> 33:25.471
any incriminating
files saved, but...

33:25.504 --> 33:27.806
we found something in his
recent Internet search history.

33:27.839 --> 33:32.044
Looked up the schedule of events
for D.C.'s Festival Latino.

33:32.078 --> 33:34.513
A Latino going to
a Latino festival.

33:34.546 --> 33:36.048
Great. We have our lead.

33:36.082 --> 33:37.716
McGEE:
Leo Silva is not in D.C.

33:37.749 --> 33:40.052
strictly to schmooze
with oil companies.

33:40.086 --> 33:41.820
His plan is happening today
at that event.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.223
Quit burying the lead;
get to the target.

33:45.091 --> 33:46.358
Sorry.

33:46.392 --> 33:48.060
Caught in the moment.
Sorry, McGee.

33:48.094 --> 33:51.097
McGEE: Boss, the person speaking
at today's event is Justice

33:51.130 --> 33:52.264
Monica Fernandez.

33:52.298 --> 33:53.365
She's the target.

33:53.399 --> 33:54.400
Look.

33:56.102 --> 33:57.769
She is an influential judge,
and she is

33:57.803 --> 34:00.372
on a short list for
the Supreme Court nomination.

34:00.406 --> 34:02.108
Why Fernandez?
Several of her rulings

34:02.141 --> 34:05.111
have favored using
alternate energy measures

34:05.144 --> 34:08.214
that would lessen our dependency
on international oil.

34:08.247 --> 34:09.515
And that impacts the Silvas.

34:09.548 --> 34:11.850
We think Silva's gonna use
his son to take her out.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.085
He's trained to do it.

34:13.119 --> 34:14.653
Best in class.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.257
Grab your gear.
All of you. Come on.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.794
*

34:34.540 --> 34:36.808
GIBBS:
Give me a sit-rep.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.345
Judge Fernandez is supposed
to be here, Gibbs,

34:39.378 --> 34:40.812
but she's not answering
her phone.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.781
McGee.
McGEE: Trying to lock
onto her signal, boss.

34:42.814 --> 34:43.815
There's too many people.

34:43.849 --> 34:46.485
Quinn.
Metro PD and security
are looped in.

34:46.518 --> 34:50.356
Torres. Torres!

34:50.389 --> 34:52.691
Just blending in with the crowd.
No visual on David.

34:52.724 --> 34:54.626
You guys got to try the corn.

34:54.660 --> 34:56.128
It's really good.

34:56.162 --> 34:57.629
They really know
how to make this.

34:57.663 --> 35:00.399
Will somebody get me a 20
on Fernandez? Now.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.801
Boss, the judge's assistant
can't even get ahold of her.

35:02.834 --> 35:04.403
I think someone's jamming
her cell.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.205
Well, if Fernandez
is in the car,

35:06.238 --> 35:08.174
then she's gonna have to go
through security to get in.

35:08.207 --> 35:09.708
They're going after the car.

35:09.741 --> 35:10.742
Torres,

35:10.776 --> 35:12.278
stage isn't the target.

35:12.311 --> 35:13.412
It's the traffic line. Go, go!

35:15.414 --> 35:17.416
WOMAN (over radio): ...Festival
Latino. If you're driving,

35:17.449 --> 35:19.751
be prepared for heavy traffic,
but come on down

35:19.785 --> 35:22.154
and support the community...
(horns honking)

35:22.188 --> 35:24.156
I'm trying. I swear.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.161
(over radio):
It's fun for the entire family.

35:30.262 --> 35:31.630
(device beeping)

35:32.598 --> 35:34.800
NCIS! Don't move!

35:34.833 --> 35:36.435
(people murmuring, gasping)

35:36.468 --> 35:41.173
Torres. Black motorcycle,
red helmet, coming your way!

35:41.207 --> 35:42.474
Get these people
out of here!

35:44.476 --> 35:46.845
(motorcycle approaching)

35:47.846 --> 35:49.348
Got him.
(horns honking)

35:54.353 --> 35:55.687
Hey, come on!
Come on, come on, come on!

35:55.721 --> 35:56.655
Keep moving! Come on!

35:56.688 --> 35:58.224
GIBBS:
Open the door.

35:58.257 --> 35:59.691
I can't! The locks, the windows!
Get out!

35:59.725 --> 36:01.527
Something's wrong.
It's jammed.

36:02.794 --> 36:04.663
Turn your head
away from the glass.

36:08.967 --> 36:09.801
Hey, David.

36:09.835 --> 36:10.802
(beeping)

36:10.836 --> 36:12.371
Come on.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.376
Go!

36:20.379 --> 36:22.348
(car alarms blaring)

36:26.252 --> 36:28.754
McGEE: The evidence against you
is irrefutable,

36:28.787 --> 36:29.521
Mr. Silva.

36:29.555 --> 36:31.290
You're going away
for a long time.

36:31.323 --> 36:32.090
For what?

36:32.123 --> 36:34.426
Being the father
of a misguided son?

36:34.460 --> 36:36.795
I'm in shock
over David's actions.

36:36.828 --> 36:38.297
BISHOP:
Agent Torres says

36:38.330 --> 36:40.399
you were the one
pulling David's strings.

36:40.432 --> 36:44.470
So why doesn't Agent Torres
question me himself?

36:45.804 --> 36:47.005
Can't face me?

36:47.038 --> 36:49.575
Or can't face the truth?

36:49.608 --> 36:51.343
Which one is it, Miguel?

36:51.377 --> 36:53.445
Whatever information he gave you

36:53.479 --> 36:55.981
about my affairs in Argentina
means nothing.

36:56.014 --> 36:57.649
You have no
jurisdiction.

36:57.683 --> 36:59.017
What about your plans
to assassinate

36:59.050 --> 37:01.253
Justice Fernandez on U.S. soil?

37:01.287 --> 37:03.589
As I told you,
that was all David's doing.

37:03.622 --> 37:05.324
I played no
part in it.

37:05.357 --> 37:08.760
A father turning on
his son-- that's cold.

37:08.794 --> 37:11.330
Almost as cold as a daughter
turning on her father.

37:12.964 --> 37:15.734
I guess nearly getting
blown up with Agent Torres

37:15.767 --> 37:17.669
rubbed Elena the wrong way.

37:17.703 --> 37:19.471
Bet you didn't expect
your daughter to record

37:19.505 --> 37:22.274
the conversation the two of you
had a few hours ago,

37:22.308 --> 37:25.744
where she confronted you
and you told her everything.

37:25.777 --> 37:27.513
That sound familiar?

37:27.546 --> 37:29.315
Care to revise your statement?

37:33.452 --> 37:36.755
Pass along my congratulations
to Agent Torres.

37:36.788 --> 37:38.924
He got his man,

37:38.957 --> 37:41.860
and destroyed both our families
in the process.

37:43.462 --> 37:45.597
I hope it was worth it.

37:49.735 --> 37:52.704
(ship horn blows in distance)

37:52.738 --> 37:54.740
(phones ringing)

38:01.613 --> 38:03.582
You know, I thought
after a few weeks

38:03.615 --> 38:05.384
I'd get used to this desk.

38:05.417 --> 38:06.785
Still feels strange.

38:06.818 --> 38:09.588
It's not about the desk, Tim.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.924
I know.

38:12.958 --> 38:16.862
Plus, if anyone's
gonna sit there,

38:16.895 --> 38:18.630
Tony would want it to be you.

38:18.664 --> 38:19.465
Thanks.

38:20.732 --> 38:24.536
Any time,
Senior Field Agent McGee.

38:24.570 --> 38:25.904
Does have a nice ring to it.
Mm-hmm.

38:25.937 --> 38:26.538
(chuckles)

38:27.906 --> 38:29.708
What's up, guys?
Torres. Hey.

38:30.876 --> 38:31.643
How's your sister?

38:31.677 --> 38:33.479
Well, she regained
consciousness.

38:33.512 --> 38:34.946
Lucia's a fighter.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.416
So, any idea when
she's gonna be released?

38:37.449 --> 38:38.850
Not for a few weeks.

38:38.884 --> 38:41.720
Figured I'd stick around
and help out with Amanda.

38:41.753 --> 38:43.455
You know, while she recovers.

38:43.489 --> 38:44.690
BISHOP:
Well...

38:44.723 --> 38:46.692
if you need anything,
we're here.

38:46.725 --> 38:48.360
Appreciate that.

38:48.394 --> 38:49.828
Gibbs around?

38:49.861 --> 38:51.397
Uh, just missed
him, actually.

38:51.430 --> 38:53.131
All right.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.533
He left something for you.

38:56.535 --> 38:57.736
Top drawer.

39:01.873 --> 39:04.443
*

39:18.957 --> 39:20.892
You can't be on Gibbs' team
without it.

39:20.926 --> 39:23.529
I never been on a team before.

39:23.562 --> 39:25.063
First time for everything.

39:27.466 --> 39:29.501
I'm not sure I'm the right fit.

39:29.535 --> 39:31.437
Only one way to find out.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.077
FORNELL:
Please be bluffing.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.579
QUINN:
Bingo!

39:40.612 --> 39:42.714
Ha! I won again.

39:42.748 --> 39:44.750
Hey, Gibbs,
perfect timing.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.184
Would you loan me $20?

39:46.217 --> 39:48.186
Quinn has just cleaned me out.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.187
(chuckles)

39:49.220 --> 39:50.489
I'm not surprised.

39:50.522 --> 39:51.423
Poker was not my choice.

39:51.457 --> 39:52.791
He talked me into it.

39:52.824 --> 39:54.426
Well, I thought you'd
take it easy on me,

39:54.460 --> 39:56.462
considering
my weakened condition.
Mm-mm.

39:56.495 --> 39:57.763
First Gibbs gets shot,

39:57.796 --> 39:59.565
then you got shot.

39:59.598 --> 40:01.467
I'm thinking you two are trying
to one-up each other

40:01.500 --> 40:03.769
on bullet wounds.
I guess I'm winning.

40:03.802 --> 40:04.970
Two words, fellas:

40:05.003 --> 40:06.204
tactical vests.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.539
What did I miss?

40:07.573 --> 40:09.808
I was just filling in
Tobias here

40:09.841 --> 40:11.943
about how Agent Torres was

40:11.977 --> 40:14.713
the absolute perfect choice
for your team.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.516
Once I figured out what
you were after, I got it.

40:17.549 --> 40:18.484
Mm. Yeah?

40:18.517 --> 40:19.651
Mm-hmm.

40:19.685 --> 40:21.753
And what was that?

40:21.787 --> 40:23.989
Well, this time, it wasn't
about finding an agent

40:24.022 --> 40:25.657
that your team needed;

40:25.691 --> 40:28.660
it was about finding an agent
that needed your team.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.698
Well, actually...

40:32.731 --> 40:34.733
I found two.

40:37.235 --> 40:38.737
I'm hoping
they both stick around.

40:40.606 --> 40:42.674
New game.

40:42.708 --> 40:44.610
I'm dealing.

40:44.643 --> 40:47.513
Who's playing?

40:47.546 --> 40:48.880
So...

40:51.750 --> 40:53.519
...come on, Quinn.

40:53.552 --> 40:54.953
Are you in?
