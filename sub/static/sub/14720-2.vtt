LEFTY: Don't you like rugby?

00:17.160 --> 00:20.120
Of course I like rugby,but it's not about rugby.

00:20.240 --> 00:21.680
Uh, I think it is, Ted.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.440
On the surface
it's about rugby.

00:23.560 --> 00:24.320
Here.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.560
So it is about rugby.
TED: No.

00:31.680 --> 00:32.480
But you just said--

00:32.600 --> 00:33.360
Shh.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.400
It is about rugby, right?

00:38.520 --> 00:40.880
Ted will probably sayit's about the black people.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.040
No, it's not about
the black people.

00:43.160 --> 00:44.360
It is a bit, Ted.

00:44.480 --> 00:45.240
No.

00:45.360 --> 00:46.920
It's about Muldoon.

00:47.040 --> 00:49.360
What it's really about isthat little pig dividing

00:49.480 --> 00:51.400
this country so him and
his poxy National mates

00:51.520 --> 00:52.560

00:52.680 --> 00:55.440
That's what it's about.

Isn't it?

01:10.640 --> 01:11.440

open the envelope first.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.440
He said this is a down payment.

From what?

06:44.520 --> 06:45.640

Not us.

Just you.

you it's not drugs.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.000
OK, what is it?

06:53.120 --> 06:54.560

you when you meet.

06:54.680 --> 06:55.840
It's a trap.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.760

it is I do, right?

07:23.880 --> 07:25.240

07:41.160 --> 07:41.920
Yeah, Rita.

07:42.040 --> 07:42.920
Your Rita.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.240
Why did Rita come and see you?

07:44.360 --> 07:46.000
Well, that's
between me and her.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.640
What do you mean, it's
between you and her?

07:47.760 --> 07:49.080
For fuck's sake, Ted,
ask her about that.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.000
Yeah, I will.

07:50.120 --> 07:51.680
Good.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.200
Because the point is, here andnow, when she came to see me,

07:54.320 --> 07:56.160
worlds collided.

07:56.280 --> 08:00.480
And things that were problemssuddenly became possibilities.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.680
Great possibilities
for you and for me.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.200
And what about Rita?

08:04.320 --> 08:07.800
Now, when I saw her, Ithought of you and your skills.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.680
See, I've got two jobs.

08:09.800 --> 08:10.680
One, it's a dawdle.

08:10.800 --> 08:11.720
You could do it in your sleep.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.320
OK?

08:13.440 --> 08:16.240
If that works out, there'sone really, really large job.

08:16.360 --> 08:19.120
Ha.

08:19.240 --> 08:22.200
Well, no offense, Des,
but I'd bloody trust

08:22.320 --> 08:24.160
Muldoon before I trusted you.

08:24.280 --> 08:29.000
Oh, that's a low blow
comparing me to Piggy.

08:29.120 --> 08:32.480
If I was a fighter and not alover, I'd do you for that.

08:32.600 --> 08:33.920
You're not a fan of the man?

08:34.040 --> 08:35.320
Oh, worse thing thathappened to this country.

08:35.440 --> 08:36.800
And what are the jobs?

08:36.920 --> 08:39.160
Oh, well, you haven'tsaid you're on board yet.

08:39.280 --> 08:43.640
Also, you can't help
me, I can't help Rita.

08:43.760 --> 08:44.760
With what?

08:44.880 --> 08:47.520
You'll have to
ask her about that.

08:47.640 --> 08:48.800
[chuckling]

08:50.160 --> 08:53.400
TED: Why'd you go
and see Des McEwen?

08:53.520 --> 08:56.760
I've just been talking to him.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.360
Why?

08:58.480 --> 09:01.320
You first.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.840
A woman I meet inside saidI should go and talk to Des

09:03.960 --> 09:05.760
about getting Wolf
a job with a guy he

09:05.880 --> 09:09.000
knows in the constructionindustry, sort of.

09:09.120 --> 09:09.880
Sort of.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.640
Well, property and stuff.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.160
I thought Wolf might
fit in well there.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.040
Why were you talking to him?

09:16.160 --> 09:18.720
Oh, he's got something going.

09:18.840 --> 09:21.560
Apparently, when he saw
you, he thought of me.

09:21.680 --> 09:22.800
What is it?

09:22.920 --> 09:25.320
TED: I don't know yet.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.600
You know, you can't
trust Des, right?

09:27.720 --> 09:29.080
You're trusting
him with our son.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.240
God, no.

09:30.360 --> 09:32.280
It's an introduction,
that's all.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.440
Des said something abouta party but that he'd have

09:35.560 --> 09:37.920
to talk to someone else first.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.240
Presumably, you.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.920
He didn't say anything
about a party to me.

19:10.680 --> 19:13.200
Your secret is safe with me, hm?

19:13.320 --> 19:14.280
Thanks, Darijo.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.240
Yeah, it's good to know.

19:16.360 --> 19:18.560
Otherwise, I'd be
very surprised to see

19:18.680 --> 19:20.080
you at this sort of party.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.960
Yeah, why? 'Cause
I'm not rich?

19:22.080 --> 19:23.600
No.

19:23.720 --> 19:27.560
I-- I would not have picked youto be at this sort of party.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.040
What sort of party?

19:29.160 --> 19:32.040
[MUSIC - PENKNIFE GLIDES, "TAKING THE WEIGHT OFF"]

19:41.080 --> 19:42.960
Making yourself at home, Rita?

19:43.080 --> 19:44.240
As far as the party goes.

19:44.360 --> 19:47.600
Oh, you wait till it
really gets started.

19:47.720 --> 19:48.920
Follow me.

19:49.040 --> 19:50.320
Where?

19:50.440 --> 19:51.520
Basement dungeon.

19:51.640 --> 19:52.600
Nah, I'm just kidding.

19:52.720 --> 19:53.480
The bloke you want.

19:53.600 --> 19:54.800
There is a dungeon.

19:54.920 --> 19:55.840
I can show you that
later if you're game.

19:55.960 --> 19:56.760
Pass.

19:56.880 --> 19:58.280
[chuckles]

20:01.840 --> 20:06.400
Evan Lace, head of
the Lace Corporation.

20:06.520 --> 20:08.480
It takes a special
kind of self-love

20:08.600 --> 20:11.600
to name a corporation
after yourself.

20:11.720 --> 20:12.480
You can't kill the devil.

20:20.360 --> 20:23.000
So the devil wins?

20:23.120 --> 20:25.400
I'm here aren't I?

20:25.520 --> 20:29.120
You know what I'd
do if I were you?

20:29.240 --> 20:32.560
I'd take the bastard's lifeapart brick by brick, dollar

20:32.680 --> 20:36.040
by dollar, till he was
begging you to stab him.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.360
DES: Evan, this is Rita, thewoman I was telling you about.

20:46.480 --> 20:47.920
Hello.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.320
Evan Lace.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.040
I know.

20:51.160 --> 20:52.840
Joanne.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.480
Hi.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.480
Thanks, Des.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.160
Well, I'll leave you to it.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.600
Hey, Des, is that other thingwe talked about getting sorted?

21:01.720 --> 21:02.600
Even as we speak.

21:09.640 --> 21:12.520
So Des says you have
something to ask me?

21:12.640 --> 21:14.520
More tell than ask.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.320
You need to give my son a job.

21:19.720 --> 21:22.000
This is one of
them swinger parties.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.160
You know, we're, um--

21:23.280 --> 21:24.120
swapped.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.920
Gee, Ted, do you think so?

21:26.040 --> 21:29.560
I should have bloodyguessed with Des involved.

21:29.680 --> 21:30.480
Where's Rita?

21:30.600 --> 21:31.440
She took off.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.080
Oh, she's meeting someone?

21:33.200 --> 21:34.880
She's in the right place.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.880
No, not like that.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
I'm gonna go
[inaudible] the room.

21:39.120 --> 21:39.920
Stay here.

21:48.800 --> 21:52.160
Go on, off you go.

21:52.280 --> 21:54.000
Eh?

21:54.120 --> 21:55.240
You know you want to.

21:55.360 --> 21:57.240
No.

21:57.360 --> 21:58.200
No way.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.520
You can do whatever
you bloody well like.

22:04.640 --> 22:05.720
I'm not gonna stop you.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.400
I don't want to--

22:08.520 --> 22:09.320
you know.

22:12.320 --> 22:15.280
But isn't it important thatwe blend in, for the good

22:15.400 --> 22:18.600
of whatever this bloody job is?

22:18.720 --> 22:21.880
Lefty, the man with one ball.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.120
Darijo.

22:23.240 --> 22:24.120
It's OK.

22:24.240 --> 22:25.520
I know you're not really here.

22:25.640 --> 22:28.600
Uh, Lefty, this is my
hot girlfriend Mandy.

22:28.720 --> 22:31.040
She's crazy.

22:31.160 --> 22:32.120
Mandy, this is Lefty.

22:32.240 --> 22:33.920
He has only one testicle.

22:34.040 --> 22:35.600
You could put it in
your mouth like a grape.

22:39.080 --> 22:41.240
You must be Mrs. Lefty.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.160
Ngaire.

22:42.280 --> 22:43.040
Ngaire.

22:43.160 --> 22:44.120
That's a beautiful name.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.560
[clears throat]

22:56.200 --> 22:58.040
MAN AND WOMAN: [moaning]

23:16.120 --> 23:17.520
No, no, I'm good.

23:17.640 --> 23:18.880
Thank you.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.360
[sniffing]

23:22.960 --> 23:24.800
[indistinct chatter]

23:34.760 --> 23:36.960
DARIJO: So, do you
like big machines?

23:37.080 --> 23:39.160
Well, what woman doesn't?

23:39.280 --> 23:41.400
I have many big machines.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.480
Graders, Euclids.

23:43.600 --> 23:46.440
That's very impressive
for someone so young.

23:46.560 --> 23:49.840
Age-- age is not important.

23:49.960 --> 23:51.840
Balls.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.240
Balls are important.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.640
Yes.

23:55.760 --> 23:59.440
Yes they are.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.200
Spa pool looks nice.

24:01.320 --> 24:03.800
Yes it does.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.040
Would you care for spa?

24:09.080 --> 24:11.720
I would care for spa.

24:11.840 --> 24:12.640
[chuckles]

24:12.760 --> 24:15.600
Hold that for me.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.000
[giggling]

24:18.520 --> 24:20.960
Very nice.

24:21.080 --> 24:21.960
What the hell are you doing?

24:22.080 --> 24:23.280
It's a party.
Partying.

24:23.400 --> 24:24.160
No.

24:24.280 --> 24:25.160
No you're not.

24:25.280 --> 24:26.480
You've had your turn, Lefty.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.200
You've had plenty of turns.

24:28.320 --> 24:29.720
It's my turn.

24:29.840 --> 24:30.920
My turn now.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.360
If you don't like
it, you can leave.

24:32.480 --> 24:34.800
Otherwise, get with the party.

24:39.120 --> 24:41.680
I'm not stopping you, Lefty.

24:41.800 --> 24:43.120
Nothing ever stops you.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.480
DARIJO: Mm.

24:48.600 --> 24:49.480
[laughs]

24:49.600 --> 24:50.360
Mm.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.840
[laughing]

24:56.400 --> 24:58.640
Oh, some days I love my job.

24:58.760 --> 24:59.800
This is bullshit, McCarthy.

24:59.920 --> 25:00.840
Get me out of here.

25:00.960 --> 25:02.280
Well, these are
serious charges.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.200
What charges?

25:03.320 --> 25:04.160
It's my car.

25:04.280 --> 25:05.600
We were doing nothing wrong.

25:05.720 --> 25:08.400
And that's for the courtto decide that, yeah.

25:08.520 --> 25:09.400
You know what this is?

25:09.520 --> 25:10.360
Mm?

25:10.480 --> 25:11.600
This is racism.

25:11.720 --> 25:12.960
Yeah.

25:13.080 --> 25:15.120
Two brown fellas in a
nice car plus racist cop

25:15.240 --> 25:17.680
equals let the court determinewhere the sun don't shine.

25:17.800 --> 25:18.840
It is a nice car, so I hear.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.400
Oh, it is.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.760
And how did a Tuareg likeyou afford a car like that?

25:21.880 --> 25:22.640
I saved up.

25:22.760 --> 25:24.440
[laughing]

25:26.400 --> 25:27.600
But you're right.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.120
You weren't doing
anything wrong.

25:29.240 --> 25:30.600
Young Terry pulled
you over because he

25:30.720 --> 25:31.840
didn't like the look of you.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.320
And we'll be leaving now.

25:33.440 --> 25:34.560
And then your
dipshit mate pulled

25:34.680 --> 25:36.280
out a fake driver's license.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.480
Bullshit.

25:37.600 --> 25:39.800
Bert, it said
"diver's license" on it.

25:39.920 --> 25:41.360
So what?

25:41.480 --> 25:44.520
Heaps of people here fakeeverything these days.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.120
No big deal.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.440
Well, it is to a kid who'shad more than his fair share

25:47.560 --> 25:49.520
of last chances.

25:49.640 --> 25:50.880
No.

25:51.000 --> 25:51.920
This is the one that's
gonna see him spending

25:52.040 --> 25:53.120
time as a guest of Her Majesty.

25:53.240 --> 25:55.400
There's no way around it.

25:55.520 --> 25:58.640
If you don't believe
me, ask him yourself.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.360
Are you OK there, Tonto?

26:11.480 --> 26:14.680
Been better, Kemosabi.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.640
I'm so sorry.

26:16.760 --> 26:18.080
What are you sorry for?

26:18.200 --> 26:20.080
Well, if I didn't getall uptight with that cop.

26:20.200 --> 26:21.400
No.

26:21.520 --> 26:22.760
This is Eric's fault.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.240
Eric, why?

26:24.360 --> 26:27.000
Who uses a forger
who can't spell?

26:27.120 --> 26:29.160
Well, how come youeven need a fake license?

26:29.280 --> 26:31.040
My parents don't
know I can drive.

26:31.160 --> 26:34.360
They think if I can drive,I will go out stealing cars.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.600
They are very wise, my parents.

26:36.720 --> 26:37.920
And violent.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.320
Especially my mother.

26:39.440 --> 26:41.680
Maybe it is better
if I go to prison,

26:41.800 --> 26:42.920
to escape her [inaudible].

26:43.040 --> 26:45.080
No way are you
going to prison.

26:45.200 --> 26:49.880
Bert, I am on my
fourth strike three.

26:50.000 --> 26:50.880
[sighs]

26:52.440 --> 26:55.280
But we had some good
times, did we not?

27:01.520 --> 27:02.800
It's actually very simple.

27:02.920 --> 27:04.720
I buy a company for
less than it's worth,

27:04.840 --> 27:07.720
and then I break it up and Isell it for more than I paid.

27:07.840 --> 27:09.360
But you never
actually make anything.

27:09.480 --> 27:11.040
I make wealth, Rita.

27:11.160 --> 27:12.240
Isn't that enough?

27:12.360 --> 27:13.200
And buildings.

27:13.320 --> 27:14.440
We're moving into property.

27:14.560 --> 27:16.520
You know, I like the
idea of a very tall

27:16.640 --> 27:18.920
building with my name on it.

27:19.040 --> 27:21.360
A monument in mirrored glass.

27:21.480 --> 27:23.320
EVAN: Yeah, something like that.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.720
So tell me about your son.

27:25.840 --> 27:28.200
Wolf, short for Wolfgang.

27:28.320 --> 27:31.680
You know, you do look far tooyoung to have a son out looking

27:31.800 --> 27:32.880
for gainful employment.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.560
Well, I started
and finished young.

27:35.680 --> 27:37.000
Wolf's an only child.

27:37.120 --> 27:38.280
Mm.

27:38.400 --> 27:41.960
Does he have any
experience in business?

27:42.080 --> 27:43.000
No.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.000
Not in business.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.920
Then why would I employ him?

27:47.040 --> 27:51.600
Because I know that there arecertain jobs that you need done

27:51.720 --> 27:55.760
from time to time to removeobstacles for your business,

27:55.880 --> 28:01.080
and my son has experienceand skills in these areas.

28:01.200 --> 28:05.600
He just needs to put themto work in the right area.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.600
Which is my area, isn't it?

28:07.720 --> 28:10.640
I think you would bothbenefit from the relationship.

28:10.760 --> 28:11.880
TED: Excuse me.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.160
I just need to grab
you for a moment.

28:15.280 --> 28:16.640
Can it wait?

28:16.760 --> 28:18.240
No.

28:18.360 --> 28:19.160
Apologies for interrupting.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.040
No problem.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.120
Is he the guy?

28:29.240 --> 28:31.120
Yes, he is, and I'mright in the middle of it.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.800
This smarmy looking bloke.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.040
Well, I'm not gonna fuckhim if that's your problem.

28:35.160 --> 28:36.840
No.
Lefty is my problem.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.280
He shot through on me.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.240
Probably sticking his dicksomewhere he shouldn't.

28:40.360 --> 28:41.920
[moaning]

28:42.040 --> 28:44.360
Well, that's no surprise, butwhat's this got to do with me?

28:44.480 --> 28:47.600
Well, I need someone towatch my back, and you're it.

28:47.720 --> 28:49.200
Ted, I'm in the
middle of something.

28:49.320 --> 28:50.880
Well, it can wait 10 minutes.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.520
Not really.

28:52.640 --> 28:54.880
Rita, if I don't do my job,it probably won't help with what

28:55.000 --> 28:55.960
you've got going on, will it?

29:01.240 --> 29:04.400
Fine, and make it quick.

29:04.520 --> 29:06.320
MAN AND WOMAN: [moaning]

29:08.360 --> 29:10.560
WOMAN: Oh my god.

29:10.680 --> 29:11.840
Trust me.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.240
They won't pay any
attention to us.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.480
Stay here.
Keep watch.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.040
If anyone tries to get
in, just stop them.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.080
Any suggestions how?

29:25.200 --> 29:26.600
By any means necessary.

29:26.720 --> 29:29.720
At this party, that
could mean anything.

29:29.840 --> 29:30.720
[sighs]

29:36.360 --> 29:38.320
TED: So why him?

29:38.440 --> 29:39.920
Why who?

29:40.040 --> 29:40.920
That guy.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.640
Why that job?

29:42.760 --> 29:45.600
Because he has a
job that Wolf can do.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.080
Any chance you could
get a bloody move on?

29:51.120 --> 29:52.960
[clicking]

29:53.080 --> 29:54.920
MAN AND WOMAN: [moaning]

29:59.960 --> 30:01.840
Oh, shit.

41:51.880 --> 41:52.640
I would.

41:52.760 --> 41:53.560
Follow me.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.520
BELINDA [ON PHONE]: Are yousure you're OK dragging him

41:58.640 --> 41:59.600
into this?

41:59.720 --> 42:00.640
RITA [ON PHONE]: He'll be fine.

42:00.760 --> 42:02.520
It'll be good for him.

42:02.640 --> 42:04.840
What about you?
How are you doing?

42:04.960 --> 42:09.960
I'm better now, thanks to you.

42:10.080 --> 42:12.240
Do you have a problem
being told what to do?

42:12.360 --> 42:13.840
It depends on
who's telling me.

42:13.960 --> 42:15.240
Explain.

42:15.360 --> 42:17.520
Well, it depends ifthey're a fuckwit or not.

42:17.640 --> 42:19.440
Do I strike you as a fuckwit?

42:19.560 --> 42:20.680
Don't know.

42:20.800 --> 42:22.640
You haven't told me
to do anything yet.

42:22.760 --> 42:24.000
So, any potential
problems are to do

42:24.120 --> 42:26.640
with the "who" rather
than the "what"

42:26.760 --> 42:28.040
it is you're being told to do.

42:28.160 --> 42:29.520
I don't have anyproblems breaking the law

42:29.640 --> 42:30.920
if that's what you're asking.

42:31.040 --> 42:34.480
It's not quite,
but close enough.

42:34.600 --> 42:35.400
[sniffs]

42:36.520 --> 42:37.560
There's a job if you want one.

42:41.560 --> 42:43.080
So, your thing
with Des went OK?

42:43.200 --> 42:45.320
Yeah, it's good.

42:45.440 --> 42:47.600
And Wolf got the job.

42:47.720 --> 42:48.840
Yep.

42:48.960 --> 42:49.760
Good.

42:56.160 --> 42:58.720
So everything's good then?

42:58.840 --> 43:00.200
I reckon.

43:00.320 --> 43:02.680
[music playing]

43:06.080 --> 43:10.640
I was walking with my friend,and my friend said, burning

43:10.760 --> 43:13.800
from my soul, disco is dead.

43:13.920 --> 43:14.680
Ha!

43:14.800 --> 43:17.680
Disco is dead.

43:17.800 --> 43:19.200
It's dead now.

43:19.320 --> 43:21.920
Disco is dead.

43:22.040 --> 43:23.480
It's dead now.

43:23.600 --> 43:31.800
[inaudible] I don't want tohear another [inaudible]..

43:31.920 --> 43:34.880
Now, disco is dead.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.400
It's dead now.

43:36.520 --> 43:39.080
Disco is dead.

43:39.200 --> 43:41.240
It's dead now.
