WEBVTT

01:51.903 --> 01:52.987
Bacon, cous?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.281
Eww. No.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.868
After what I saw at the Church of Night
yesterday, I am fasting.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.663
Maybe for the rest of my life,
but definitely until later tonight.

02:01.746 --> 02:03.581
Oh

02:03.790 --> 02:06.584
Mmm, after Harvey's shift,
we're going to the movies.

02:06.918 --> 02:09.504
How casually you can say that.

02:10.588 --> 02:12.882
Soon, Luke and I will be able
to do the same.

02:13.675 --> 02:15.593
Fun, but how's that gonna work?

02:15.677 --> 02:17.387
Luke has a connection
with the High Priest.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.806
He's offered to speak
with Father Blackwood on my behalf

02:19.889 --> 02:21.683
to get my conviction overturned.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.603
Ambrose, you're smitten.

02:26.604 --> 02:28.189
Where's your Aunt Hilda?

02:28.273 --> 02:31.860
She's working at the bookstore, Aunt Zee.
Remember, it's Black Friday.

02:31.943 --> 02:36.030
-It most certainly is not.
-No, I don't mean witches' Black Friday.

02:36.447 --> 02:39.492
I mean it's Black Friday for mortals.
It's the busiest shopping day of the year.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.786
-It's also one of our busiest times.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.830
The Kemper bodies
are already on their way,

02:43.913 --> 02:45.248
and Satan knows who else.

02:45.331 --> 02:47.792
Spellman Mortuary, this is Zelda.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.171
No, we hadn't heard.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.343
Sabrina, there's been an accident
down at the mines.

02:58.511 --> 03:01.431
-But Harvey--
-Go. And pray to Satan he's all right.

03:15.445 --> 03:19.490
Hey, hey! I'm looking for Harvey Kinkle.
Uh, who do I talk to about--

03:21.659 --> 03:23.828
Excuse me. Have you seen Harvey Kinkle?

03:27.248 --> 03:30.919
Excuse me. Have you seen Harvey Kinkle?
He's got brown hair and--

03:31.002 --> 03:31.878
Sabrina!

03:34.255 --> 03:36.174
Harvey! Oh, my gosh.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.929
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you,

03:41.012 --> 03:42.972
thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.559
I made it out in time.

03:46.768 --> 03:50.271
But there are five guys still in there,
and Sabrina, Tommy's one of them.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.315
-Oh, no.
-I need to go back in.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.776
-I can't leave him in there.
-Hey, hey, hold on. Hold on.

03:54.859 --> 03:56.527
Harvey, you look like you're in shock.

03:56.611 --> 04:00.281
-I gotta find my dad.
-Sabrina! Harvey!

04:00.365 --> 04:02.200
-Guys!
-Is he okay?

04:02.283 --> 04:05.036
I don't know. He was in the mines
when it happened.

04:05.119 --> 04:06.871
-Oh, my God.
-We should, um...

04:08.164 --> 04:10.750
Let's find somewhere to set up
so we can start helping.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.095
Sabrina.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.561
Dear God,

04:30.645 --> 04:34.774
we ask that you surround our loved ones
with angels...

04:35.566 --> 04:36.401
Harvey.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.947
-How's it going in there?
-Not good. The borehole

04:41.030 --> 04:44.409
they're drilling to reach the survivors
is too small. All the guys are too big.

04:44.742 --> 04:46.869
No one can fit through it,
not even me. I tried.

04:46.953 --> 04:50.540
Harvey, I-- I don't want you going
back down there.

04:50.623 --> 04:53.501
-My brother's trapped under all that rock.
-I know, but...

04:53.835 --> 04:56.504
Oh my gosh, you're really bleeding.

04:56.587 --> 04:59.424
It's fine. -Please.

05:08.599 --> 05:10.977
We have to find him.
He can't-- Tommy can't be--

05:11.060 --> 05:12.520
I know. I know.

05:13.187 --> 05:15.189
But you have to pace yourself, Harvey.

05:15.273 --> 05:16.899
Everybody else is taking breaks.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.068
After we find Tommy
and the rest of the guys.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.653
-But first...

05:24.282 --> 05:27.452
Harvey, this cut is pretty deep.

05:27.535 --> 05:29.037
I think it may need stitches.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.873
Stay here.
I'm gonna go track down a doctor.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.594
What's going on over there?

05:44.677 --> 05:48.056
Not sure. They're saying some kid got
a wild idea and slipped into the mines

05:48.139 --> 05:49.390
when no one was looking.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.684
Sabrina, I don't know where Susie is.

05:51.768 --> 05:54.854
Oh, no. You don't think...

06:00.443 --> 06:02.695
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.448
Susie! What's going on

06:05.531 --> 06:08.117
-You could have been killed!
-I was small enough for the hole.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.244
And it's what my Aunt Dorothea
told me to do.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.245
What does that mean?

06:12.288 --> 06:14.791
I mean, it's what
my Aunt Dorothea would've done.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.210
-I didn't find anyone.

06:18.127 --> 06:19.837
-I just found this.
-Oh, my God.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.506
The hell's going on here?

06:31.224 --> 06:32.725
Excuse me. Excuse me.

06:34.977 --> 06:35.978
That's...

06:37.146 --> 06:38.981
-That's Tommy's hat.

06:39.982 --> 06:41.401
Did we-- Did we find him?

06:43.236 --> 06:45.696
Well, then,
we gotta keep looking, we gotta--

06:45.780 --> 06:49.158
And we will. But not right now.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.869
It's turning into a shit-show in there.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.997
The faster we dig,
the more the tunnel collapses.

06:55.373 --> 06:58.334
We don't have the right equipment,
but we're getting it tomorrow.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.752
We'll pick up again then.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.676
Thank you all for coming here,

07:06.759 --> 07:08.678
but unless you are an employee of the mine

07:08.761 --> 07:11.222
or a rescue worker
for the town of Greendale,

07:11.305 --> 07:13.015
I need you all to go home.

07:14.183 --> 07:17.270
Really, folks, thank you for the support.

07:17.562 --> 07:18.646
See you tomorrow.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.065
Dad, what if tomorrow's too late?

07:21.482 --> 07:24.193
Boy, don't start with me.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.988
We are doing our best.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.831
-Harvey.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.015
He saved me.

07:55.808 --> 07:56.767
Tommy did.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.063
When the mine began to collapse...

08:02.899 --> 08:04.567
Tommy pushed me out of the way.

08:06.569 --> 08:07.987
He said to run, so...

08:09.739 --> 08:12.825
I did. I just... I ran.

08:16.662 --> 08:21.626
-I was chicken shit again.
-No... you weren't.

08:24.587 --> 08:27.507
Somehow the tunnel held long enough
for me to get through.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.968
Then I heard this roar behind me like...

08:32.261 --> 08:35.056
Like the earth was closing up
and trying to swallow me.

08:38.893 --> 08:41.395
How do you think it is
that I made it out of there?

08:43.147 --> 08:45.024
Qui affecto protego,

08:45.107 --> 08:50.988
mixtisque iubas
serpentibus et posteris meis stirpiqu.

08:52.949 --> 08:56.994
Maybe... someone was looking out for you.

09:00.748 --> 09:01.707
That's Tommy.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.418
-Always has been.

09:07.755 --> 09:11.592
They say that the first 12 hours
after any mining accident are the most...

09:12.718 --> 09:13.553
crucial.

09:15.012 --> 09:17.181
If you don't find survivors
in that time...

09:18.099 --> 09:19.767
their chances are slim to...

09:24.647 --> 09:26.482
Everything's gonna be okay.

09:31.529 --> 09:32.530
You're cold.

09:40.496 --> 09:41.539
I'm okay.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.566
Will you stay with me?

10:10.860 --> 10:12.028
All night long.

10:28.961 --> 10:29.962
Sabrina.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.840
Aunt Hilda.
Have you been at work all this time?

10:32.923 --> 10:36.135
Yeah, I have. Dr. Cee kept
the bookstore open through the night,

10:36.218 --> 10:39.347
just to give free coffee
and hot chocolate to the volunteers.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.514
How's sweet Harvey?

10:41.515 --> 10:42.975
He went home with his dad.

10:43.225 --> 10:45.770
I'm gonna go get changed,
then we're meeting back at the mines.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.855
-Okay, come on. Let's go.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.983
Come inside, the both of you.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.449
Ambrose and I have news.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.911
Brace yourselves, it's not pleasant.

11:02.787 --> 11:07.458
I was astral-projecting,
with Auntie Zee keeping watch...

11:08.501 --> 11:10.836
and I went to the mines.

11:14.632 --> 11:15.925
There were no survivors in there.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.806
Dear Lucifer...

11:21.889 --> 11:22.890
...are you sure?

11:24.684 --> 11:25.976
I'm fairly certain, yes.

11:26.060 --> 11:29.897
Well, in that case, we should tell them.
Harvey is losing his mind with worry.

11:29.980 --> 11:33.359
And people might get hurt
if the search continues.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.611
Unfortunately, we can't do that, Sabrina.

11:36.654 --> 11:40.991
This is the perilousness of being a witch
who consorts with mortals.

11:41.617 --> 11:45.246
Having knowledge they don't,
not being able to act on it or share it.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.957
It just-- It doesn't make any sense.

11:49.625 --> 11:50.710
Things happen.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.753
Awful things. Accidents.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.464
But the natural order is to be maintained.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.509
That's one of our basic tenets.

11:59.301 --> 12:02.430
Things must play out as they would
without our interference.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.266
-Otherwise--
-Bad things happen, I know.

12:05.850 --> 12:09.228
It is a terrible tragedy
for all of them in there.

12:11.188 --> 12:13.357
Did you know him well, Sabrina?

12:13.816 --> 12:14.984
-Tommy?
-Hmm.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.861
I met him a few times, but...

12:18.779 --> 12:21.157
he meant everything to Harvey.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.285
He, uh...

12:28.789 --> 12:30.291
He's gonna be devastated.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.836
Dad, are we heading back to...

12:37.006 --> 12:38.799
Harvey, this is Mr. Morris, from the bank.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.010
Mr. Morris,
this is my younger boy, Harvey.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.263
-Hey.
-I'm very sorry about your brother.

12:45.014 --> 12:48.058
We... We still haven't found him.

12:50.227 --> 12:51.312
Harvey, I...

12:52.229 --> 12:55.733
I don't like making this decision
any more than you like hearing it.

12:55.816 --> 12:56.734
Hearing what?

12:58.319 --> 12:59.487
What decision, Dad?

13:01.405 --> 13:04.575
I have the safety of the other men
to consider here.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.582
-He called off the search.
-Who did?

13:11.665 --> 13:15.127
My asshole father. He said he couldn't
risk the loss of any more lives,

13:15.211 --> 13:16.837
but I know that's bullshit!

13:18.005 --> 13:21.592
He was already talking to the bank
and the insurance company,

13:21.675 --> 13:24.428
because he cares more about the payout
than he does about finding Tommy.

13:24.512 --> 13:28.265
-No, Harvey, he's just worried. Like you.
-No, Sabrina, he's coming here

13:28.349 --> 13:30.226
to plan Tommy's funeral for tomorrow.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.645
He's rushing it because he can't collect
the insurance check

13:32.728 --> 13:34.146
until there's been a funeral.

13:35.272 --> 13:37.817
And we--
we haven't even have his body yet.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.904
What kind of man does that,

13:42.321 --> 13:46.617
when his own son could still be alive
and suffering?

13:52.331 --> 13:54.375
You guys haven't seen Sabrina, have you?

13:54.458 --> 13:56.293
She hasn't been to seminar
in the last two days.

13:56.377 --> 13:59.380
Oh, didn't you hear? There was
a terrible accident at the mines.

13:59.463 --> 14:00.881
A bunch of mortals died.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.967
What

14:03.050 --> 14:05.010
His brother. It's tragic, really.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.303
Or it would be...

14:06.387 --> 14:09.139
If the Kinkles weren't a family
of dirty witch hunters.

14:09.223 --> 14:12.184
-Funeral's tomorrow.
-Heard they're burying an empty casket.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.244
Auntie

14:38.043 --> 14:39.253
What happens when you die?

14:40.212 --> 14:42.256
Hmm

14:43.632 --> 14:46.302
Well, uh, I can only speak to witches.

14:47.052 --> 14:50.014
And I suppose you're curious to know

14:50.097 --> 14:52.349
what happens to mortals
like young Thomas Kinkle.

14:54.768 --> 14:55.895
I don't know.

14:58.731 --> 14:59.773
Does dying hurt?

15:01.317 --> 15:03.694
All those times with Aunt Zelda, I mean.

15:03.986 --> 15:07.531
Well, it depends on her murder weapon
of choice, really.

15:10.326 --> 15:13.495
And how is it that Aunt Zelda
brings you back?

15:13.579 --> 15:16.957
Does she cast a spell, or are you cursed?

15:17.041 --> 15:20.002
No. No, nothing of the sort.

15:20.085 --> 15:23.631
It's, um...
It's all about the soil, actually.

15:24.548 --> 15:29.094
Uh, more specifically, a plot of soil...

15:29.678 --> 15:31.597
in our graveyard out front.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.183
It's been in the Spellman family
for generations.

15:34.475 --> 15:39.730
Purportedly, it is soil that was harvested
from Cain's garden

15:39.813 --> 15:41.649
and soaked with Abel's blood.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.902
The most fertile soil on Earth.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.530
And contains all the mysteries
of life and death.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.077
Done it.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.162
Why don't you put it on.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.164
Okay.

15:59.416 --> 16:02.628
-This little foot. This little foot.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.047
Here we go.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.593
I know why you're asking.

16:12.638 --> 16:16.767
But bringing back the dead
is by and large a no-no.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.812
Easier done with witches,

16:20.187 --> 16:23.774
and never, ever to be tried with mortals.

16:26.193 --> 16:28.988
It is not our place, as Aunt Zelda says.

16:30.197 --> 16:33.283
And Cain's garden,
that's just for witches.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.244
Don't worry, Aunt Hilda.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.454
I haven't got any ideas.

16:40.290 --> 16:43.127
Even if I did, it's not like
we have Tommy's body to bury.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.212
Just his hat.

16:45.879 --> 16:46.922
I'm sorry.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.231
Dr. Cee.

17:04.314 --> 17:07.276
Hilda, I'm here to pay my respects.

17:08.068 --> 17:11.947
Tommy used to bring Harvey into the shop
to buy comic books, and now...

17:12.906 --> 17:15.409
I know
that he'll appreciate that you came.

17:16.285 --> 17:18.078
It's really... sweet.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.790
Warms the heart, doesn't it?

17:23.125 --> 17:26.628
Seeing all of Greendale turn out
for one of their fallen sons.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.214
But that's mining towns for you.

17:29.590 --> 17:30.883
The sturdiest stock.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.135
Now, Sabrina,

17:33.552 --> 17:37.097
I know young Harvey Kinkle
has been moonlighting in the mines.

17:38.432 --> 17:41.769
I have to admit, when I heard
about the collapse, I...

17:42.770 --> 17:43.729
I feared the worst.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.190
He made it out, Ms. Wardwell.

17:46.815 --> 17:49.401
I think because I placed
a protection spell on him.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.195
A protection spell?

17:51.278 --> 17:54.156
After the Kinkles shot the familiar
in Moon Valley,

17:54.239 --> 17:56.950
I was afraid
the Weird Sisters might retaliate, so...

17:58.619 --> 18:01.538
Wait, you don't think... they...

18:02.372 --> 18:06.794
If I were to hazard a guess,
I'd say... no.

18:07.294 --> 18:09.088
Of course, we always want
someone to blame,

18:09.171 --> 18:12.299
even in the face
of naturally occurring tragedies.

18:12.382 --> 18:16.095
That's just human and witch nature.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.223
I mean, in that way,
we're not so very different.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.145
Oh, Auntie Zee,

18:25.395 --> 18:28.565
do any mortals ever realize life
while they're living it?

18:29.441 --> 18:31.318
Every fleeting, precious moment?

18:31.693 --> 18:32.528
No.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.739
The poets and artists, maybe. They do.

18:35.989 --> 18:37.991
Not that we're much better, mind you.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.162
Auntie Zee, are you crying?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.623
Pollen.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.500
Let's get this over with.

19:25.914 --> 19:28.584
Harvey, it's your turn, love.

19:38.427 --> 19:39.428
Uh...

19:41.013 --> 19:41.847
We...

19:43.098 --> 19:44.016
Um...

19:45.184 --> 19:46.059
We...

19:47.853 --> 19:48.687
Um...

19:48.770 --> 19:50.522
Strength by day,
strength by night,

19:50.606 --> 19:52.149
give him strength and give him might.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.487
We're gathered here today...

19:58.113 --> 19:59.740
to say goodbye to my brother...

20:01.116 --> 20:02.201
Thomas Kinkle.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.579
Uh...

20:06.371 --> 20:07.206
Tommy.

20:09.249 --> 20:10.375
My best friend.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.211
He is...

20:14.713 --> 20:15.547
was...

20:17.382 --> 20:18.217
God...

20:21.637 --> 20:22.930
I don't know what to say.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.682
It's just crazy to give a eulogy
when you're not even sure if...

20:27.935 --> 20:28.936
Um...

20:29.811 --> 20:31.313
He called me "nerd."

20:34.191 --> 20:36.318
He bought my school supplies every year.

20:37.611 --> 20:38.987
We talked about everything.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.115
We talked about girls.

20:43.992 --> 20:46.578
Well... one girl.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.958
He protected me
from everything that's bad.

20:52.542 --> 20:57.714
Once, I asked him
what his dream was, and he said...

20:58.882 --> 21:02.928
he said that his dream
was that my dreams come true...

21:04.763 --> 21:06.598
which is who he was. And I...

21:08.976 --> 21:10.102
I miss him.

21:14.398 --> 21:15.315
Thank you.

21:25.409 --> 21:30.580
My son, Thomas Kinkle,
was a good, honorable man.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.125
We can all take comfort knowing

21:33.583 --> 21:35.794
that he's reunited
with his mother in Heaven.

21:36.962 --> 21:40.132
Tommy valued family and duty
above all else.

21:41.425 --> 21:44.136
He did what was asked of him
and never complained.

21:45.262 --> 21:46.847
He understood the danger...

21:48.974 --> 21:55.022
but he also knew
the mines are the lifeblood of Greendale.

21:55.439 --> 21:59.401
And Tommy, he loved our mines.

21:59.484 --> 22:00.944
No, he didn't.

22:03.864 --> 22:06.450
-Boy--
-Tommy hated the mines, Dad.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.785
He only worked there
because you forced him to.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.829
For some stupid family legacy.

22:10.912 --> 22:13.081
You had your turn, Harvey.
You sit down now.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.917
No, Tommy could've gotten out
of this hellhole if it wasn't for you.

22:16.001 --> 22:19.671
But you, you wouldn't let him go,
would you

22:20.672 --> 22:21.715
That's it.

22:22.549 --> 22:24.468
Sit down.

22:25.302 --> 22:27.220
I said, sit down!

22:44.279 --> 22:45.113
Harvey.

22:52.329 --> 22:53.497
Harvey.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.293
I can't live in that house without him.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.754
I can't live alone with my dad.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.924
I-- I'm so sorry, Harvey.

23:05.425 --> 23:08.053
And the worst part is,
I'm the reason he's dead.

23:08.261 --> 23:12.641
-You know that's not true.
-Yes! Yes, it is! 'Brina, look at that!

23:14.226 --> 23:15.727
A letter from Notre Dame?

23:16.895 --> 23:18.730
It's an acceptance letter for Tommy.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.483
He applied and got in three years ago.

23:21.566 --> 23:24.111
He could've gone
on a football scholarship, a full ride.

23:24.778 --> 23:27.572
I found it in his room when I was looking
for a photo for the funeral.

23:27.948 --> 23:29.074
I don't understand.

23:29.449 --> 23:31.618
He could've gotten out
of this shitty town,

23:31.993 --> 23:34.788
but he stayed for me to protect me.
I know it.

23:35.664 --> 23:36.665
I killed him.

23:38.667 --> 23:39.793
I killed my brother.

23:40.961 --> 23:41.920
What am I gonna do?

23:42.003 --> 23:45.632
You're gonna man up,
that's what you're gonna do.

23:46.299 --> 23:48.468
You think it's okay for you
to embarrass me like that?

23:48.552 --> 23:51.721
In front of the other guys

23:51.805 --> 23:53.640
Let go of him, Mr. Kinkle.

23:53.723 --> 23:55.183
It shouldn't have been Tommy.

23:56.184 --> 23:58.854
-It should've been you.
-I wish it had been me.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.441
-I wish to God it had been me.
-Oh, you shit.

24:02.524 --> 24:05.569
-You little pathetic piece of--
-Mr. Kinkle!

24:06.027 --> 24:07.446
This is your son's funeral.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.199
Might we honor his memory
and compose ourselves?

24:12.325 --> 24:14.369
Your guests are leaving.
I suggest you do the same.

24:22.711 --> 24:25.755
-Wait. Harvey! Harvey, don't go.
-I need to be alone, 'Brina, please.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.845
Time, Sabrina.

24:34.139 --> 24:34.973
Give him time.

24:41.104 --> 24:42.439
Poor Harvey Kinkle.

24:43.982 --> 24:46.234
How will he ever survive in that house,

24:46.443 --> 24:50.363
alone, with that bulldozer of a father?

24:52.949 --> 24:54.201
He won't survive.

24:55.076 --> 24:57.204
Not without his brother, that's the truth.

25:03.502 --> 25:08.089
Ms. Wardwell, my father asked you
to look out for me, and you have.

25:08.465 --> 25:12.219
Now I'm asking for... for more.

25:12.469 --> 25:16.348
For help. And you can't mention
what I'm about to say to my Aunties.

25:16.431 --> 25:18.308
No. Of course I wouldn't.

25:21.770 --> 25:24.648
-Well, what are you thinking?
-I'm thinking...

25:25.815 --> 25:27.025
I keep thinking...

25:28.443 --> 25:30.362
Tommy's body still hasn't been found.

25:32.405 --> 25:33.281
Yes?

25:33.573 --> 25:37.077
So if... he were to...

25:38.036 --> 25:38.995
come back...

25:39.829 --> 25:42.999
there would be some questions,
but not many.

25:44.668 --> 25:45.752
"Come back"?

25:46.962 --> 25:48.171
Um...

25:51.216 --> 25:54.761
Are you talking
about a resurrection spell?

25:55.053 --> 25:58.265
You saw Harvey, Ms. Wardwell.
He needs his brother back.

25:58.598 --> 26:03.395
Necromancy is the darkest
and most dangerous of the sacred magics.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.188
It's...

26:07.232 --> 26:10.652
-Well, it's death magic.
-Please, Ms. Wardwell.

26:11.319 --> 26:12.737
I love him.

26:13.780 --> 26:17.534
And as Sabrina, his girlfriend,
I can only do so much.

26:17.617 --> 26:19.160
As Sabrina the witch...

26:20.954 --> 26:23.373
I could... fix this.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.166
If I-- If...

26:26.585 --> 26:31.298
If we have... the power
to ease his suffering,

26:31.673 --> 26:32.924
why shouldn't I use it?

26:35.218 --> 26:38.430
Well, for a start, there are rules.

26:39.764 --> 26:42.267
And it's a treacherous business.

26:43.018 --> 26:49.649
Life. Death. The... afterlife.
These are not things to be trifled with.

26:49.733 --> 26:52.110
Why -Well, no, actually.

26:52.193 --> 26:55.697
The incantation I have is really
quite simple and yields great results.

26:55.780 --> 26:56.990
I've seen them firsthand.

26:57.991 --> 26:59.075
But you can't.

27:00.994 --> 27:04.372
-I beg you.
-Wait, you have this incantation?

27:04.456 --> 27:08.335
Somewhere in my office,
on the shelves in Baxter High.

27:08.918 --> 27:14.132
A Book of the Dead,
full of all sorts of necromantic rites.

27:15.592 --> 27:19.429
But, Sabrina...
even if you did use this rite,

27:19.512 --> 27:23.058
there's one part of the spell
that's unspeakable.

27:23.141 --> 27:25.435
-Which part?
-I'm loathe to say it out loud.

27:25.518 --> 27:29.606
The spell requires an offering
for the dead to rise.

27:31.399 --> 27:34.361
-Balance out the cosmic forces.
-Oh.

27:35.528 --> 27:38.114
Someone has to die
for Tommy to live again.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.992
An eye for an eye. A life for a life.

27:43.119 --> 27:44.913
But you couldn't cross that line.

27:52.379 --> 27:57.175
You are many things, Sabrina Spellman,
but a killer is not one of them.

28:10.730 --> 28:11.815
Father Blackwood!

28:12.399 --> 28:13.525
Sister Zelda.

28:14.734 --> 28:16.903
We've had quite the day here,
but do come in.

28:17.570 --> 28:19.698
I assume you've come for an update
about your wife.

28:19.906 --> 28:21.908
In fact, I'm here to see your nephew.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.578
Brother Ambrose, I am at a loss.

28:25.912 --> 28:30.458
As soon as Lucas spoke to me about you,
I looked into your dossier.

28:31.251 --> 28:37.173
You went to Oxford
and published a book of poetry at 17.

28:37.257 --> 28:42.971
You painted with the Surrealists,
taught stage magic to Houdini.

28:44.013 --> 28:47.225
My boy, how did you ever end up
as part of a plot to blow up the Vatican?

28:48.893 --> 28:52.689
My father died young.
He was killed by witch hunters.

28:54.190 --> 28:57.736
I drifted from university to university...

28:58.319 --> 29:00.155
trying to find a father figure.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.450
And then, I found one.

29:04.325 --> 29:08.163
He was brilliant, charismatic,
and devoted to the Dark Lord.

29:09.456 --> 29:10.749
A young Crowley.

29:12.208 --> 29:14.002
And his mission became my mission.

29:17.046 --> 29:19.466
You were the only witch arrested
for that plot,

29:20.091 --> 29:22.552
but you did not act alone,
Brother Ambrose.

29:23.052 --> 29:24.971
It's true. No, I...

29:25.555 --> 29:26.723
I was offered a deal.

29:27.599 --> 29:28.683
Immunity...

29:29.684 --> 29:32.103
if I gave up the names
of my co-conspirators.

29:32.937 --> 29:34.856
But alas, I could not do it.

29:36.149 --> 29:38.902
Well, that offer still stands.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.322
Give me the names of the others
who plotted with you...

29:43.156 --> 29:45.116
and you shall have your freedom.

29:55.418 --> 29:58.463
I will return to hear your decision.

30:07.222 --> 30:08.264
Your Excellency.

30:08.348 --> 30:11.017
If you have a moment,
I wonder if I might bother you.

30:13.937 --> 30:17.649
I'm in need of your spiritual guidance.

30:23.363 --> 30:28.201
It's been some time since I've submitted
to Satanic confession.

30:29.953 --> 30:34.249
But I must confess to you now
I fear my family is straying too far

30:34.332 --> 30:35.542
from the Path of Night.

30:36.626 --> 30:38.503
Indeed.

30:38.628 --> 30:42.048
There can be no other recourse
but to prostrate yourself

30:42.465 --> 30:45.218
before the Dark Lord. Go on.

30:51.850 --> 30:55.311
I've fought to hold the Spellmans
to the mark since Edward's death.

30:55.395 --> 30:58.022
But we're a fallen family.

30:58.982 --> 31:02.569
Half-mortal, house-arrested,
excommunicated.

31:03.862 --> 31:07.699
There are times I feel I'm running
a halfway house for wayward witches.

31:11.578 --> 31:13.162
I'm failing, Father.

31:14.747 --> 31:18.001
Failing the Church of Night.
Failing you.

31:22.672 --> 31:24.299
Unlike the False God...

31:25.466 --> 31:27.886
the Dark Lord accepts our weakness.

31:29.012 --> 31:32.056
He knows we are made of flesh and failure.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.603
This is our nature, Sister Zelda.

31:46.029 --> 31:47.822
I, too, know fear...

31:49.240 --> 31:50.325
and suffering.

31:53.411 --> 31:57.498
Of course you know,
my wife threatened my faith

31:57.582 --> 31:59.375
with her transgression at the lottery.

32:00.668 --> 32:04.714
What's more, while I await
the fate and gender of my children...

32:06.633 --> 32:08.509
Lady Blackwood has...

32:10.303 --> 32:11.554
denied herself to me.

32:12.138 --> 32:12.972
No.

32:14.682 --> 32:15.558
Yes.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.269
Many months now.

32:18.770 --> 32:22.190
To be forsaken, untouched.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.276
That is not the Dark Lord's will...

32:26.277 --> 32:27.612
for any of us.

32:30.698 --> 32:31.532
Faustus.

32:31.824 --> 32:32.742
Zelda.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.476
Susie.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.189
Dorothea.

33:04.023 --> 33:06.567
I did what you asked.
I went into the mines.

33:06.651 --> 33:07.485
You did.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.487
You're a very brave boy.

33:10.697 --> 33:14.242
Putnams have always been brave
since this township was founded.

33:15.284 --> 33:17.286
-How did it feel?
-Scary.

33:18.788 --> 33:20.581
But really good, too.

33:20.665 --> 33:24.043
And that... was just the beginning.

33:44.439 --> 33:47.442
'Brina. Okay, this is gonna sound weird.

33:48.526 --> 33:50.820
Like, really, really weird.

33:51.237 --> 33:52.071
What is?

33:53.656 --> 33:54.907
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

33:55.742 --> 33:57.869
You remember
when Tommy's casket fell over?

33:57.952 --> 34:01.831
When you went after Harvey,
I picked up Tommy's hard hat.

34:02.957 --> 34:08.087
And while I was holding it... I had...

34:09.380 --> 34:10.465
It was...

34:11.799 --> 34:13.593
Well, it was like a vision.

34:15.136 --> 34:16.596
A flash.

34:17.513 --> 34:19.599
And I know how that sounds.

34:21.559 --> 34:24.353
But one second, I was at the funeral...

34:34.405 --> 34:36.574
...and then the next, I was in the mines.

34:37.283 --> 34:41.079
-I saw these two creepy girls.

34:41.329 --> 34:45.041
And they were wearing
old-fashioned dresses with lace collars.

34:45.666 --> 34:47.794
Just two girls

34:48.503 --> 34:51.255
Just two.
And they were playing with dolls.

35:09.315 --> 35:11.275
Weird, right?

35:11.609 --> 35:14.862
Yeah, definitely weird.

35:16.739 --> 35:20.034
Okay, Roz, I'm gonna need you
to describe these two girls to me

35:20.118 --> 35:22.870
in as much detail
as you can possibly remember.

35:25.248 --> 35:30.753
Hic ante circulum
appareatis prudentiae, Prudence.

35:31.337 --> 35:34.340
In pulchra figura humana,

35:34.423 --> 35:37.260
and tortuositate aliqua.

35:37.343 --> 35:39.011
That's enough, Sabrina.

35:40.888 --> 35:41.973
You summoned me.

35:42.056 --> 35:44.350
I'm here. What do you want?

35:44.934 --> 35:46.060
Revenge.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.604
I can get behind that. On who?

35:48.688 --> 35:52.066
Your venomous sisters
went after my boyfriend and his brother.

35:52.733 --> 35:54.443
Harvey's alive, but Tommy's dead.

35:54.861 --> 35:56.612
And so are four other mortals.

35:56.696 --> 36:01.325
That's five innocent lives lost
for Dorcas' and Agatha's amusement.

36:01.909 --> 36:03.828
What do you want, Sabrina?

36:04.996 --> 36:06.414
I want Tommy back.

36:09.542 --> 36:13.254
Besides, you owe me
from when I saved you from Lady Blackwood.

36:16.299 --> 36:17.466
And I have a plan.

36:22.471 --> 36:24.473
Agatha! Dorcas!

36:25.683 --> 36:28.436
What's wrong, Sabrina?
Hi, Prudence.

36:28.936 --> 36:30.313
Admit the truth, right now!

36:30.396 --> 36:33.232
Did you cause the mine collapse
that killed Tommy Kinkle?

36:34.775 --> 36:38.779
You think we carried out blood atonement

36:38.863 --> 36:40.364
For the murder of a familiar?

36:40.448 --> 36:42.074
I guess anything's possible.

36:42.325 --> 36:43.910
Blood will have blood.

36:43.993 --> 36:45.828
You see? They admit it.

36:46.746 --> 36:48.831
Is that what you were plotting, sisters?

36:49.165 --> 36:52.376
When you claimed to be thanking
the Dark Lord for my salvation?

36:52.460 --> 36:53.878
You'd gone soft, Prudence.

36:53.961 --> 36:55.671
Something had to be done.

36:55.755 --> 36:58.883
Since there was nothing natural
about Tommy's death,

36:58.966 --> 37:02.053
then one of you bitches is gonna help me
balance the scales.

37:02.136 --> 37:03.554
A life for a life.

37:03.846 --> 37:06.432
So, who's it gonna be?

37:07.600 --> 37:10.269
-You don't have the guts to kill anyone.
-She may not.

37:11.687 --> 37:12.980
But I do.

37:14.190 --> 37:16.525
How dare you act without my permission.

37:17.443 --> 37:21.197
Now, which one of you was the mastermind

37:25.409 --> 37:26.619
It was Agatha.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.163
It was all her idea.
I didn't even want to do it.

37:29.622 --> 37:30.748
Is that true?

37:32.041 --> 37:34.710
I'm just sorry
the other Kinkle boy didn't die, too.

37:37.630 --> 37:39.840
Bring them to the woods tonight, Prudence.

37:40.299 --> 37:42.385
Agatha will pay the debt she owes.

37:43.511 --> 37:45.471
Murder and resurrection, Sabrina?

37:46.138 --> 37:47.473
You've gone dark.

37:48.224 --> 37:51.519
There are no limits to what I would do
to help the ones I love.

37:51.686 --> 37:52.770
What time?

37:54.021 --> 37:55.273
Can I watch?

37:57.108 --> 37:58.609
You're talking necromancy, right?

37:59.110 --> 38:01.904
Well, there's no way I'm gonna miss that,
so, what time?

38:02.154 --> 38:03.906
-What woods?
-Midnight.

38:03.990 --> 38:05.741
In the clearing by the creek bed.

38:06.367 --> 38:08.953
-Prudence, I'm your sister.
-Not tonight you aren't.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.540
-You'll need a Book of the Dead.
-I'll get one.

38:53.956 --> 38:56.125
And the child takes another step...

38:56.751 --> 38:58.336
on the road to perdition.

39:21.650 --> 39:24.278
I can't believe you're doing this
to Agatha. She's our sister.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.864
Leave, if you want,
but if you stay, Dorcas,

39:26.947 --> 39:29.617
shut your mouth,
or we'll sacrifice you, too.

39:29.825 --> 39:31.410
As a student of necromancy,

39:31.494 --> 39:34.080
I strongly advise that you recite the text
word for word.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.832
The slightest deviation
and we could all wind up dead.

39:39.168 --> 39:42.213
There are three stages
to the Rite of Resurrection.

39:43.130 --> 39:43.964
First...

39:46.175 --> 39:47.635
we invoke the hounds.

39:49.178 --> 39:53.057
"Hounds of Heaven,
Hounds of Hell, Hounds of Earth,

39:53.140 --> 39:54.600
Guardians of the Door,

39:54.683 --> 39:58.354
we summon thee
to help us resurrect the fallen son."

39:59.021 --> 40:03.275
Nos si vocare te.
Nos si vocare te.

40:03.692 --> 40:07.988
Nos si vocare te. Nos si vocare te.

40:11.575 --> 40:13.994
Unholy shit, it's working.

40:15.788 --> 40:20.167
The second stage,
we must open the door between worlds.

40:21.502 --> 40:24.296
"We bow before the Door
that divides the World of the Living

40:24.380 --> 40:26.215
from the World of the Dead.

40:26.298 --> 40:29.343
With humble gratitude,
we ask that it be opened."

40:29.427 --> 40:31.345
Aperi ianuam.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.139
Aperi ianuam.

40:33.514 --> 40:35.516
Aperi ianuam.

40:35.599 --> 40:37.226
Aperi ianuam.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.403
Wait for it.

40:54.410 --> 40:56.120
The door's open.

40:56.704 --> 41:01.208
The third and final stage, the Sacrifice.

41:01.709 --> 41:03.836
Would you like to do the honors?

41:06.046 --> 41:07.339
With pleasure.

41:14.930 --> 41:18.350
Remember, you brought this upon yourself.

41:20.227 --> 41:25.357
Unholiest of Spirits,
we offer thee a life for a life!

41:26.400 --> 41:28.444
O mighty Dark Lord...

41:28.527 --> 41:31.739
-Vita est vita.
-...by whom all is set afire,

41:32.072 --> 41:36.744
thy power be thy path, thy will my desire.

41:36.827 --> 41:38.287
Vita est vita.

41:45.753 --> 41:49.507
Sabrina... are you sure about this?

41:52.259 --> 41:53.302
I have to be.

42:18.410 --> 42:19.912
''The Hounds invoked."

42:20.579 --> 42:22.498
"The Door opened.

42:22.581 --> 42:24.875
The price paid in blood.

42:25.834 --> 42:29.213
Thomas Kinkle, we entreat thee.

42:29.672 --> 42:30.631
Rise.

42:31.215 --> 42:32.258
Rise.

42:32.716 --> 42:34.260
Rise!"

42:41.934 --> 42:42.768
What now?

42:43.185 --> 42:45.646
We wait. Thirteen minutes.

42:46.605 --> 42:50.067
Time enough for all the traces
of the witch's soul to leave the body.

42:50.150 --> 42:51.151
And then?

42:51.819 --> 42:52.945
We bury her.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.464
-Cover her all the way up.
-Why are we burying her here?

43:12.548 --> 43:14.466
Why not just leave her in the woods?

43:15.801 --> 43:18.262
Shut up and dig.

43:24.226 --> 43:25.227
Sabrina.

43:27.313 --> 43:28.606
Oh, crap.

43:28.897 --> 43:31.275
Necromancy, Sabrina?
This is the stupidest,

43:31.358 --> 43:33.902
the most irresponsible thing
you have ever done.

43:34.236 --> 43:37.114
What would give you the idea to do
something like this in the first place?

43:37.197 --> 43:40.117
-The Monkey's Paw, for Lucifer's sake?
-Harvey was broken, Ambrose.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.702
I had to do something.

43:41.785 --> 43:43.245
Yes, yes, you've mucked about

43:43.329 --> 43:46.624
with the most potent,
wicked forces that exist.

43:46.915 --> 43:48.751
Much more powerful
than the Dark Lord.

43:48.834 --> 43:52.004
-I'm talking about Death, cousin.
-I followed the ritual to the letter.

43:52.087 --> 43:55.674
Then what are you and your friends
doing in our Cain Pit?

43:55.758 --> 43:59.845
The rite demanded that someone be killed
so that Tommy would come back.

43:59.928 --> 44:01.889
Agatha was that someone.

44:02.890 --> 44:07.227
But, the ritual didn't mention anything
about the murdered sacrifice

44:07.311 --> 44:09.021
having to stay dead.

44:09.104 --> 44:12.441
Why must you always insist...

44:13.192 --> 44:16.236
that the universe grant you
special privileges?

44:16.904 --> 44:19.782
You've upset the natural order.
You do realize that, don't you?

44:19.865 --> 44:22.660
That there are rules.
There is no cheating fate.

44:22.743 --> 44:25.996
What's the point of being a witch
if I can't help the ones I love?

44:26.080 --> 44:30.376
You've crossed a line this time.
No, no... No, you've completely erased it.

44:30.459 --> 44:33.045
There's no reason to think
that the spell will fail.

44:43.180 --> 44:45.974
And that would be Agatha.

44:46.892 --> 44:48.894
Right on schedule. See?

44:49.937 --> 44:51.897
Everything's going according to plan.

44:55.234 --> 44:56.902
Infamous last words, cousin.

44:59.571 --> 45:01.031
Thirteen hours, Ambrose.

45:02.199 --> 45:03.575
Tommy will be back.

45:04.952 --> 45:05.994
You'll see.

45:09.331 --> 45:11.333
Everything will be okay in 13 hours.

45:28.642 --> 45:30.144
Welcome back, sister.

45:35.357 --> 45:36.442
Where am I?

45:37.985 --> 45:39.027
Where was I?

45:39.319 --> 45:40.779
So you didn't kill her?

45:41.280 --> 45:45.743
We did, but only because Sabrina
had a plan to bring Agatha back.

45:46.201 --> 45:49.705
You, Sister Agatha, were dead.
For 13 minutes.

45:49.788 --> 45:51.039
Now you're back.

45:53.250 --> 45:55.127
Actions have consequences.

45:55.836 --> 45:57.963
By killing those mortals
so helter-skelter,

45:58.046 --> 45:59.882
you risked exposing us.

46:00.507 --> 46:02.259
Imagine if my father found out.

46:03.886 --> 46:06.096
You'd still be in the ground right now.

46:08.265 --> 46:09.266
So...

46:10.559 --> 46:11.602
I'll thank you...

46:12.644 --> 46:17.983
to never take such an action
without my explicit permission again.

46:33.081 --> 46:35.334
You look a delight this morning, sister!

46:35.584 --> 46:38.420
The season agrees with me, Hilda.

46:38.879 --> 46:42.800
I'm off to work.
I love saying that. "Work!"

46:43.133 --> 46:45.844
You don't need to set the table
for me tonight,

46:45.928 --> 46:48.388
'cause, you know, I might be late again.

46:50.766 --> 46:51.600
Okay.

46:52.768 --> 46:56.605
So what are you, uh--
What are you gonna get up to today?

46:56.939 --> 46:59.608
I believe the... High Priest is calling.

47:13.997 --> 47:15.165
You good, 'Brina?

47:15.791 --> 47:17.334
You keep looking at the clock.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.920
Oh yeah, Roz. Just, uh...

47:20.796 --> 47:22.506
Just waiting for the bell to ring.

47:23.924 --> 47:27.344
But I was gonna say, WICCA hosting
a fundraiser is a great idea.

47:27.427 --> 47:28.887
Great idea.

47:28.971 --> 47:31.849
I mean, it's the least we can do
for the miners and their families.

47:32.474 --> 47:36.895
For us, it's over.
But for them, it just goes on and on.

47:37.271 --> 47:39.481
-Yeah, it's awful.

47:41.316 --> 47:43.986
So, uh... Roz?

47:44.778 --> 47:47.364
That vision... you had.

47:55.706 --> 47:59.710
My Nana Ruth...
said that when she went blind...

48:00.878 --> 48:05.173
she started having these visions,
all the time.

48:05.757 --> 48:07.968
Things that she couldn't possibly
have seen.

48:08.218 --> 48:09.845
Things that had happened...

48:10.596 --> 48:12.306
things that were going to happen.

48:12.890 --> 48:14.308
The craziest part?

48:14.850 --> 48:16.685
Nana says our blindness is a curse.

48:18.562 --> 48:20.564
This might just be the dementia talking,

48:20.647 --> 48:24.151
but she believes
that one of our ancestors crossed a witch.

48:25.986 --> 48:27.362
I know.

48:27.779 --> 48:31.199
And that that witch
cursed her with blindness,

48:31.283 --> 48:35.537
and that that curse has been passed down
through the Walker women for generations.

48:36.413 --> 48:38.665
And the visions?

48:38.790 --> 48:41.001
The cunning, she calls it.

48:42.711 --> 48:45.130
An extra sense we develop as we go blind.

48:46.757 --> 48:48.759
I told you it was crazy.

49:07.653 --> 49:09.321
Ambrose, my dear boy.

49:12.449 --> 49:14.034
Have you reached a decision?

49:18.580 --> 49:21.917
I'm sorry, Your Excellency, but I cannot
give up the names of my co-conspirators.

49:24.002 --> 49:25.671
I'm very happy to hear that.

49:27.506 --> 49:30.217
Integrity, honor, loyalty.

49:31.009 --> 49:33.762
These are traits we should prize
in the Church of Night.

49:40.394 --> 49:43.689
I cannot lift your sentence entirely,
but I can lessen it.

49:46.441 --> 49:48.777
Come work for me
at the Academy of Unseen Arts.

49:49.069 --> 49:52.197
The tribunal will allow it
as a form of community service.

49:52.948 --> 49:58.412
Then, together, you and I will work
towards your pardon and complete freedom.

50:04.668 --> 50:07.462
Faustus, I need to speak with you at once.

50:07.963 --> 50:09.214
And in private.

50:23.103 --> 50:24.271
What does this mean?

50:25.564 --> 50:28.233
"Snips and snails," Faustus.

50:29.151 --> 50:31.403
The results are promising.

50:31.695 --> 50:35.574
The Dark Lord has likely honored you...

50:36.074 --> 50:37.159
...with boys.

50:40.287 --> 50:41.204
Twin sons?

50:41.288 --> 50:44.041
To carry out
the Blackwood legacy together.

50:45.959 --> 50:48.628
Praise Satan, you are truly blessed!

50:50.255 --> 50:52.632
I fear you forget yourself, Sister Zelda.

50:56.136 --> 50:58.680
But I thank you for your... service.

51:00.390 --> 51:02.517
-But, Faustus, the other day--
-Yes.

51:02.601 --> 51:05.896
You confessed certain things to me,
certain weaknesses I felt as well.

51:07.105 --> 51:09.524
I was remiss in not assigning you penance.

51:10.358 --> 51:12.903
-Penance?
-Flagellation, Sister.

51:13.403 --> 51:16.907
To strengthen the body and will.
Thirty lashes should suffice.

51:17.491 --> 51:19.451
I assume you have a cat o' nine tails?

51:19.534 --> 51:22.204
I do... somewhere.

51:22.704 --> 51:26.083
Good. We'll do it here, then.
Your door has a lock, I presume.

51:26.166 --> 51:27.417
It does, but...

51:28.752 --> 51:30.045
I don't understand.

51:30.128 --> 51:33.924
You will flagellate me,
and then I will flagellate you.

51:34.007 --> 51:38.136
And together,
we will suffer in exquisite...

51:39.429 --> 51:40.347
ecstasy.

51:43.600 --> 51:44.935
How does that sound?

51:46.269 --> 51:48.897
-Entirely appropriate.
-Hmm.

51:58.031 --> 51:59.074
Harvey.

52:00.492 --> 52:01.493
You're back.

52:02.953 --> 52:05.831
Yeah. Mostly to get away from my dad.

52:07.165 --> 52:09.918
Everyone's acting weird.
Treating me different, like...

52:10.460 --> 52:12.546
now I'm that kid
whose brother died in the mines.

52:12.629 --> 52:15.090
Don't give up hope just yet, Harvey.

52:16.091 --> 52:18.426
You never know. A miracle could happen.

52:21.054 --> 52:22.264
I don't know, 'Brina.

52:23.473 --> 52:24.891
If it hasn't happened yet...

52:55.964 --> 52:58.300
Oh, Sweet Hell.
What happened with Tommy?

52:58.383 --> 53:00.218
Nothing happened, Ambrose.

53:01.469 --> 53:03.388
It's been over 13 hours,

53:03.471 --> 53:05.056
-and it didn't work.

53:06.558 --> 53:07.726
Consider it a blessing.

53:09.603 --> 53:12.230
I went back to the woods
and the effigy was just lying there.

53:12.314 --> 53:13.732
What do you mean, back to the woods?

53:13.815 --> 53:17.027
No, the soul returns to the body...
wherever that is.

53:17.485 --> 53:20.405
-What? But the rite didn't say--

53:20.989 --> 53:22.449
You're playing with life and death

53:22.532 --> 53:25.076
and you don't even know
the basics, cousin!

53:25.952 --> 53:27.120
Oh, my gosh.

53:28.705 --> 53:29.956
He's at the mines.

55:48.011 --> 55:49.429
Brett, move your head.
