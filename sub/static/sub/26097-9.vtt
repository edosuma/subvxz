00:21.146 --> 00:23.148
<i>It's called the orca greeting ceremony.</i>

00:25.359 --> 00:27.361
<i>It's how they know everything is okay.</i>

00:29.821 --> 00:31.990
<i>Because that's what rituals do.</i>

00:34.743 --> 00:36.453

It's time for your "happy birthdays."
You get 16 this year.

-[repeating] Happy birthday.

[Sam] I only got to 13 birthdays.
I still need to say it three more times.

IT'S CASEY'S BIRTHDAY!

03:02.557 --> 03:05.602
There she is, my birthday girl.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.980
-I made you a special birthday breakfast.
-This looks like what I eat every day.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.399
With a strawberry.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.527
So any special big plans for tonight?

03:13.819 --> 03:16.488
Um, I'm probably just going to do
what I always do.

03:16.571 --> 03:20.075
I think Evan and Sharice are coming over,
and we're going to watch a movie,

03:20.158 --> 03:22.285
and just chill, low-key.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.286
No drama.

03:23.370 --> 03:26.790
-Happy birthday, happy birthday.
-Thank you. Hi.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.125
This came for you, Sam.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.335
That's a big envelope.
Is it from Denton?

03:30.419 --> 03:32.045
-That means you got in.
-Nope.

03:32.504 --> 03:36.133
I used $200 of my own money,
from my own bank account,

03:36.216 --> 03:39.177
to adopt my own baby penguin
from the penguin cam.

03:39.261 --> 03:40.804
You bought a penguin?

03:41.221 --> 03:44.182
-Adopted. Me and ten other people.
-Is it gonna live here?

03:44.266 --> 03:45.767
-That's kick-ass.
-No.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.936
She'll stay at the aquarium, obviously.

03:48.019 --> 03:51.022
But I'm the majority shareholder,
so I have naming rights.

03:51.106 --> 03:54.568
Well, you can name it Casey,
both sort of came on the same day, kinda.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.486
Two Caseys in one family?

03:56.570 --> 03:59.990
I mean, Mom's Christmas newsletter
won't make any sense.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.200
I can't believe you're 16.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.411
I still remember the day you were born.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.204
I remember the day you were hatched.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.373
Well, happy birthday.
I'll see you guys later.

04:08.457 --> 04:09.791
-Love you.
-Wait!

04:09.875 --> 04:11.418
We didn't do the Casey sandwich.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.338
Oh, we don't have to do that
this year, Sam.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.341
Yeah, we do.
It's part of the birthday ritual.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.509
We do it every year.

04:19.885 --> 04:22.554
Okay. Well, we'll do it really quick.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.097
-Yes.
-[Casey yells] No!

04:24.931 --> 04:28.560
All right, happy birthday.
Happy birthday. I'll see you guys later.

04:28.643 --> 04:29.603
Bye, honey.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.440
Mwah!

04:34.274 --> 04:36.485
-Okay. I need to go.
-Wait!

04:36.568 --> 04:38.528
You need to drink
your birthday chocolate milk.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.989
Sam, I can't drink this.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.576
-It's like it's looking at me.
-But it's part of the ritual.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.623
Mmm! Ritual-licious.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.208
WEAR UNDERWEAR BACKWARDS
(ME, NOT CASEY)

BIRTHDAY MILK.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.052
[mobile phone ringing]

05:03.303 --> 05:04.262
I have to go.

05:04.346 --> 05:07.307
If you want to be a slave
to time, man, go for it.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.810
I don't know what that means. Bye.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.063
Oh! Bailey Bennett.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.899
Is this a casual relationship

05:16.066 --> 05:17.776
or a regular relationship?

05:17.859 --> 05:21.571
This is not a relationship.
This is nothing. [laughs]

05:21.655 --> 05:23.740
We kiss sometimes and that's it.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.952
-And I can't tell anyone, correct?
-Correct.

05:28.703 --> 05:32.624
Can I tell people that I made out
with someone, but not say who it is?

05:33.333 --> 05:34.626
I don't care.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.212
Okay. Thank you for your clarity.

05:48.557 --> 05:50.016
Look at this place.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.519
I always forget how nice it is.
I feel underdressed.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.312
Nah, you look like
all the other chauffeurs.

05:54.396 --> 05:55.564
Shut up, you punk.

05:55.647 --> 05:57.065
You ready for this?

05:57.148 --> 05:58.275
Sure am, are you?

05:59.276 --> 06:00.110
Not really.

06:01.820 --> 06:05.073
Wow, you are...
You're surprisingly good at this.

06:06.157 --> 06:08.410
Yeah, I mean, it's basically just like...

06:08.493 --> 06:10.495
running, but with tires instead of feet.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.250
So, um...

06:15.834 --> 06:17.002
How's school?

06:17.878 --> 06:18.753
It's fine.

06:19.754 --> 06:23.633
I don't have any friends,
so I got a lot of time for my studies.

06:24.259 --> 06:27.554
What about your friend Auggie or Ozzy?

06:27.637 --> 06:30.432
Izzie. We're not really friends anymore.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.560
Oh! [stammers] I'm out of the loop.

06:33.643 --> 06:34.519
It's fine.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.730
You got your own stuff going on.

06:38.064 --> 06:41.318
Mom moving out, then back in and...

06:41.943 --> 06:43.612
hopefully back out again?

06:43.695 --> 06:44.905
Who knows.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.656
Make this right here.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.410
Look at that, you signaled and everything.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.288
-I'm not an idiot.
-Yeah, I know.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.750
So whatever happens...

06:56.833 --> 06:59.544
with Mom and I, it's between us, okay?

07:00.462 --> 07:01.379
It's...

07:01.713 --> 07:03.590
She's always going to love you guys.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.092
She's always going to have your back.
So don't...

07:06.426 --> 07:08.303
Don't worry about it. It's our thing.

07:08.678 --> 07:09.638
I know.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.766
It's just--
Whenever she does something nice,

07:12.849 --> 07:14.601
I remember seeing her kiss that bartender.

07:15.894 --> 07:19.898
[breathes deeply] Sometimes it's just,
like, all I can think about.

07:21.191 --> 07:23.068
Sorry. You know, I wish...

07:23.944 --> 07:25.612
I wish you never saw that.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.280
Me, too.

07:29.658 --> 07:33.036
Hey, but she hasn't done anything
to piss me off in a while, so...

07:34.037 --> 07:36.289
You know, it's probably
just a matter of time.

07:36.831 --> 07:38.875
-Yeah, probably.
-[Casey laughs]

07:39.292 --> 07:42.128
[Elsa] Okay, everyone!
The birthday girl is almost here.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.339
So what are we going to say
when she gets here?

07:44.422 --> 07:45.548
[all at once] Surprise.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.760
Yeah, but less like you're at a funeral.
Okay?

07:48.843 --> 07:50.387
Who says "surprise" at a funeral?

07:50.470 --> 07:53.598
Hey, Mrs. G, this is some party.

07:53.682 --> 07:56.267
Well, Casey's never had
a big birthday party,

07:56.351 --> 07:58.937
so I figured... 16,  perfect year.

07:59.020 --> 08:02.941
Yeah, totally.
And I love the... sentiment, um...

08:03.858 --> 08:07.946
I think that Casey said
that she wanted, like, something small.

08:08.655 --> 08:13.618
I know. But this has been
a really hard year for her.

08:13.952 --> 08:16.246
Because of... well...

08:17.288 --> 08:18.498
me, so...

08:19.082 --> 08:22.252
I need to do this, and... she deserves it.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.378
-Yeah.
-Right?

08:23.461 --> 08:25.088
-Yeah, she does.
-[both chuckle]

08:26.047 --> 08:27.298
Whatcha working on, busy beaver?

08:27.716 --> 08:29.592
Making a birthday comic for Casey.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.052
It's part of the ritual.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.638
Oh, shit, I didn't get her anything.
Throw my name on that?

08:36.474 --> 08:38.435
Wait, what's up with you?
You seem different.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.936
What do you mean?

08:40.311 --> 08:43.523
You have a secret, Sam Gardner.
Look at me.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.650
[guests chattering]

08:47.902 --> 08:49.112
You've been smooching.

08:49.571 --> 08:50.530
True.

08:50.613 --> 08:53.867
Look at you! Under my tutelage!
I knew it.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.326
So, who's the lucky lady?

08:55.910 --> 08:56.953
I can't tell anyone.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.039
-Sam...
-Hi, Sam.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.835
Okay, I see.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.837
Say no more, brother.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.630
I hear you loud and clear.

09:08.048 --> 09:08.923
Okay.

09:10.008 --> 09:11.092
They're coming!

09:11.176 --> 09:12.761
[Elsa] Everybody, hide.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.599
Sam, honey.

09:27.442 --> 09:30.028
Look, I'm all for hiding
if there's a good reason,

09:30.111 --> 09:31.154
but who're we fooling?

09:31.237 --> 09:33.907
That kid's holding a paper plate
in front of his face.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.992
Why am I crouching in a skirt?

09:36.367 --> 09:38.495
-[whispering] Doug and I had sex.
-Really?

09:38.578 --> 09:39.829
That's amazing.

09:40.455 --> 09:42.248
Are you back together? What's going on?

09:42.332 --> 09:44.292
No, he's been distant.

09:45.376 --> 09:46.920
He slept in the sunroom.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.631
Here's what you got to do:
throw yourself at him.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.258
I normally wouldn't say that to someone,

09:52.342 --> 09:55.095
but this is a critical moment
and I want you to be happy.

10:00.683 --> 10:02.852
Hey, dude, what are you doing here?

10:02.936 --> 10:06.314
There's a surprise party for you inside
and I hate surprises.

10:06.397 --> 10:09.651
-Yeah, me too.
-No. Sorry, kid. We gotta do it.

10:09.734 --> 10:12.070
-Thank you. Thanks for that.
-No problem.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.322
[door unlocks and opens]

10:16.157 --> 10:18.535
[all yell at once] Surprise!

10:18.618 --> 10:19.911
Happy birthday.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.371
[cheering and applauding]

10:21.454 --> 10:22.413
Hi.

10:23.123 --> 10:23.957
Hi, guys.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.334
[Evan] Are you surprised?

10:27.127 --> 10:30.171
Yeah. Hey. Hi.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.590
Hey, Casey, happy birthday again.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.717
Time to play Ickle Bickle Beanstalk.

10:34.801 --> 10:35.885
Not right now, Sam.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.054
[girl] Happy birthday, Casey.

10:38.638 --> 10:42.559
-What's Ickle Bickle Beanstalk?
-It's a silly game I made up ten years ago

10:42.642 --> 10:45.520
after two glasses of wine,
when the kids were climbing the walls.

10:45.603 --> 10:49.232
I don't know, somehow it made it
into Casey's birthday ritual.

10:49.732 --> 10:52.652
I'm shocked it's lasted ten years.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.946
Come on. I'll hide the Ickle Bickle.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.030
No, I said no.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.366
But I don't want Edison to die.

10:58.950 --> 11:02.495
Not many people know this,
but Edison isn't my first tortoise.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.206
First...

11:06.291 --> 11:07.542
there was Tesla.

11:09.043 --> 11:13.298
But on Casey's 12th birthday, she broke
her arm and we had to go to the hospital

11:13.381 --> 11:15.175
and I never completed our ritual.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.179
When we got home, Tesla was dead.

11:20.722 --> 11:23.558
My parents said it had nothing to do
with the ritual.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.394
But that morning
Tesla was the picture of health.

11:27.645 --> 11:31.024
He was active and alert.
His eyes were clear and bright.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.943
His stool was solid and black.
So explain that.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.990
Ever since then,
I always complete the ritual.

11:39.824 --> 11:40.950
<i>Always.</i>

11:43.036 --> 11:44.078
Hey, it's okay.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.372
[guests chattering]

11:46.956 --> 11:49.834
It's okay. There's no reason
to get upset. Okay?

11:50.376 --> 11:51.461
You want tighter or looser?

11:51.544 --> 11:52.795
-Tighter.
-Okay.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.505
-[guests chattering]
-[music playing]

11:54.631 --> 11:55.798
[Sam sighs in relief]

11:55.924 --> 11:57.300
Is that better?

11:58.218 --> 12:00.220
-Yeah.
-Okay. Okay.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.475

25:03.752 --> 25:06.547
[Sam]<i> It's just necessary</i>
<i>for mating or survival.</i>

25:08.716 --> 25:11.343
I was going to say sorry too, but...

25:11.844 --> 25:13.554
-I guess we're okay.
-Yeah.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.599
I'm officially asking for a rain check
on my birthday gift.

25:18.308 --> 25:19.435
Yeah, granted.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.480
Hey. Where is everybody?

25:24.231 --> 25:25.399
I sent them home.

25:25.482 --> 25:27.609
All right, you guys, come on.
Let's have some cake.

25:27.693 --> 25:30.279
[Sam]<i> Humans, however,</i>
<i>have a lot of unnecessary rituals</i>

25:30.362 --> 25:32.781
<i>that have nothing to do</i>
<i>with mating or survival.</i>

25:32.865 --> 25:36.368
<i>-♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>
-No, no singing.

25:36.452 --> 25:38.871
Casey hates the "Happy Birthday" song,
right?

25:39.538 --> 25:42.166
Yeah. Thanks for remembering.

25:42.249 --> 25:45.961
Okay, let's sing "Twinkle, Twinkle,
Little Star" instead. I'll start.

25:46.045 --> 25:49.381
<i>♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♪</i>

25:49.465 --> 25:52.593

26:02.227 --> 26:05.397

26:07.232 --> 26:08.358
Thanks for the party, Mom.

26:08.442 --> 26:09.777
Honey, I'm so sorry.

26:09.860 --> 26:11.361
No, it's okay.

26:11.653 --> 26:12.488
Really.

26:12.863 --> 26:14.364
This is a weird family.

26:14.448 --> 26:17.076
Yeah. But doesn't Casey look pretty?

26:17.826 --> 26:18.994
What, you too?

26:19.078 --> 26:20.788

26:33.509 --> 26:35.385
<i>some of them are still kind of nice.</i>

26:37.137 --> 26:38.222
What's up?

26:39.056 --> 26:39.973
Not much.

26:40.057 --> 26:41.517
I found the Ickle Bickle.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.060
It was in the sunroom.

26:43.143 --> 26:44.311
Yeah, I heard.

26:45.187 --> 26:47.272
I'm sorry I didn't finish playing.

26:47.356 --> 26:48.982
I know how much it means to you.

26:49.650 --> 26:52.027
It's okay.
I think I was being annoying.

26:52.402 --> 26:53.320
You were.

26:53.737 --> 26:57.282
But I was a pain, too, so...
maybe we can call it even.

26:57.741 --> 26:58.575
Deal.

27:00.494 --> 27:01.495
You know...

27:02.121 --> 27:05.040
there's still one more part
of the birthday ritual.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.625
I was hoping you'd say that.

27:08.377 --> 27:12.089
What are Little Dude and Little Sis
getting into this year?

27:12.172 --> 27:14.049
Discovering the Souther Pole?

27:14.133 --> 27:16.510
No, but good idea for next year.

27:17.386 --> 27:20.848
[Casey laughs] We're so fast.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.518
Drahid.

27:24.601 --> 27:25.936
-That's Zahid...
-Yeah.

27:26.019 --> 27:26.937
...as a dragon.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.941
You know, I think this is my favorite part
of the birthday ritual.

27:32.025 --> 27:34.653
I'm going to miss it
when you're away at school next year.

27:34.736 --> 27:37.447
I won't be that far,
I'll only be at Denton.

27:37.865 --> 27:40.826
-You will?
-Yes. I got my acceptance letter

27:40.909 --> 27:43.579
to the scientific illustration program
this afternoon.

27:44.663 --> 27:45.956
That's huge news!

27:46.039 --> 27:48.375
-Ow!
-Why didn't you say anything?

27:49.209 --> 27:51.295
[sighs] Today is your day.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.634
-Stop doing that.
-That's so annoying.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.596
Sam...

28:01.346 --> 28:03.473
[sighs] You're going to do big things.

28:04.057 --> 28:05.976
-I know.
-[Casey chuckles]

28:06.059 --> 28:08.145
Hey, who wants to watch a movie?

28:08.228 --> 28:10.689
No violence, but I'll allow exposed butts.

28:10.772 --> 28:13.192
I like butts. Should we get Dad?

28:13.275 --> 28:14.484
Sure.

28:14.568 --> 28:16.320
I don't know where he is.

28:16.403 --> 28:17.654
He was just here.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.031
Let's not wait.

28:27.456 --> 28:29.458
