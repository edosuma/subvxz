WEBVTT

00:01.164 --> 00:03.228
This is the slowest dinner
rush we've ever had.

00:03.412 --> 00:05.036
Ooh, the city must have taken down

00:05.138 --> 00:08.331
your "Last Sandwich
for 40 Miles" sign.

00:08.365 --> 00:11.366
Oh! This sandwich is amazing.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.900
It's a pesto mayonnaise
with a smoked turkey

00:13.934 --> 00:15.867
and a fancy cheese
I've never heard of.

00:15.901 --> 00:19.067
I know it's fancy,
because it's not spray on.

00:19.101 --> 00:21.202
Where did you get that?

00:21.236 --> 00:23.869
At the new place down the street,
The Late Nite Bite.

00:23.904 --> 00:26.035
It's super close.
We can go there all the time.

00:26.070 --> 00:28.804
The only problem is
it's super packed.

00:29.739 --> 00:31.606
Not like this place. [scoffs]

00:33.208 --> 00:37.310
There's another sandwich shop
on Waverly Place? Competition?

00:37.345 --> 00:40.712
There's no competition.
Let me try that.

00:44.215 --> 00:47.950
Mmm. Mmm. There's no competition.

00:53.623 --> 00:55.190
Mmmm.

00:55.223 --> 00:58.191
This sandwich is even
better than pizza.

00:58.225 --> 01:01.126
Can I have it back, please?

01:01.160 --> 01:03.328
Jerry, maybe we should
send somebody down there

01:03.362 --> 01:04.495
to check it out, huh?

01:06.465 --> 01:07.698
I'll go.

01:07.832 --> 01:12.035
No, no, no. I'll go.
I need a new sandwich, anyway.

01:12.070 --> 01:14.670
We only send you on
missions of destruction.

01:14.704 --> 01:17.404
Max we send to confuse people.

01:17.438 --> 01:21.607
For research and surveillance,
Justin's our guy.

01:22.543 --> 01:24.576
OK. I've got just the decoy.

01:24.611 --> 01:27.012
I'll speak with an
Australian accent.

01:27.046 --> 01:28.878
"G'day, mate. I'd like to try

01:28.913 --> 01:32.581
one of your shrimp on the
barbie sandy-wiches... mate."

01:32.616 --> 01:33.715
Hmm?

01:35.951 --> 01:38.252
No, that's not an
Australian accent.

01:38.286 --> 01:42.422
I'm a master of voices. Listen.

01:46.526 --> 01:49.762
"I'd like to try your shrimp
on the barbie sandy-wich...

01:50.697 --> 01:52.198
...mate."

01:54.968 --> 01:59.070
That's not an accent. That's
your lame Jim Carrey impression.

01:59.104 --> 02:01.438
Yeah, but you knew who it was.

02:02.706 --> 02:05.108
It's gonna be in my one-man
show when school starts.

02:05.142 --> 02:08.610
I'm gonna work on my
impressions all summer.

02:08.645 --> 02:11.045
All summer long, huh?

02:12.415 --> 02:17.218
All work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy.

02:21.556 --> 02:23.890
Jack Nicholson.

02:24.992 --> 02:27.793
Oh, I got one. OK. Um...

02:27.828 --> 02:31.864
All summer with no Max
makes Alex a happy girl.

02:33.233 --> 02:34.901
[whispering] Alex Russo.

02:37.437 --> 02:39.504
<i>* Well you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *</i>

02:39.806 --> 02:41.473
<i>* And the end will no doubt
justify the means *</i>

02:42.008 --> 02:43.341
<i>* You can fix any problem with
the slightest of ease *</i>

02:43.375 --> 02:45.175
<i>* Yes please *</i>

02:45.209 --> 02:47.043
<i>* But you might find out it'll
go to your head *</i>

02:47.711 --> 02:48.944
<i>* When you write a report on a
book you never read *</i>

02:49.578 --> 02:51.545
<i>* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *</i>

02:51.579 --> 02:53.079
<i>* That's what I said *</i>

02:53.180 --> 02:56.281
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

02:56.316 --> 03:00.118
<i>* When you can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *</i>

03:00.152 --> 03:03.922
<i>* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *</i>

03:03.956 --> 03:07.791
<i>* Because everything is
not what it seems *</i>

03:07.826 --> 03:11.494
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

03:11.528 --> 03:15.597
<i>* When you can have what you want
by the simplest of means *</i>

03:15.631 --> 03:19.299
<i>* Be careful not to mess with
the balance of things *</i>

03:19.334 --> 03:23.469
<i>* Because everything is not... *</i>

03:23.504 --> 03:26.172
<i>* What it seems *</i>

03:26.173 --> 03:34.173
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:37.079 --> 03:40.982
As expected,
the place is very busy.

03:42.484 --> 03:43.751
Aha!

03:43.785 --> 03:47.220
<i>They're open 24 hours.</i>

03:47.254 --> 03:50.322
<i>I don't know why I said "Aha."</i>

03:53.125 --> 03:55.626
Oh! There's one of their menus.

03:58.965 --> 04:01.834
<i>You know there are take-out menus.</i>

04:03.771 --> 04:05.439
If you want a copy,
the trash can out front

04:05.473 --> 04:07.040
probably has 20 of them.

04:08.576 --> 04:11.077
[bad accent] I take
photographs of menus.

04:12.746 --> 04:18.218
I'm an artist.
An Australian menu artist.

04:19.587 --> 04:22.021
Love your variety of sandy-wiches.

04:23.824 --> 04:26.359
I'm so on board with your
whole Australian thing

04:26.393 --> 04:28.594
until you said, "sandy-wiches."

04:28.629 --> 04:31.897
[fake laugh] They don't say that?

04:33.233 --> 04:35.601
I'm... I'm sorry.

04:35.635 --> 04:38.870
Don't be sorry.
I like fake accents.

04:38.905 --> 04:41.206
I also like fake mustaches.

04:41.240 --> 04:45.143
Oh, my gosh. I have one.
I knew I should have worn it.

04:46.245 --> 04:48.513
It's OK. I was kind of kidding.

04:48.547 --> 04:52.917
[chuckles] Oh. Um... I'm Justin.

04:52.952 --> 04:55.454
I'm Juliet.

04:55.488 --> 04:57.623
Sorry.

04:57.657 --> 04:59.791
Want to hear about our special?

04:59.825 --> 05:02.693
I think I'm looking at it.

05:04.226 --> 05:06.260
Oh, was that smooth?

05:07.329 --> 05:09.597
You kinda ruined it
by talking about it.

05:10.899 --> 05:12.699
You're still cute, though.

05:14.102 --> 05:17.505
Juliet, you didn't tell me
we had a special visitor.

05:17.539 --> 05:22.109
Pardon me. Aren't you the young man
who works at Waverly Sub Station?

05:22.144 --> 05:25.579
Oh, I got a sandwich
there last week.

05:25.613 --> 05:28.949
Yeah, I was on a rather bland diet

05:28.983 --> 05:30.917
and you guys really
got me through it.

05:30.952 --> 05:33.720
- Thank you.
- I'm Justin Russo.

05:33.754 --> 05:36.923
- Oh.
- And...

05:37.992 --> 05:39.526
Lovely dress.

05:39.560 --> 05:42.428
I've always thought people
should get dressed up

05:42.462 --> 05:43.796
to make sandwiches.

05:43.831 --> 05:47.133
Out of respect for
the profession...

05:48.435 --> 05:50.936
...of sandwich making.

05:50.970 --> 05:54.840
Ooh. Insincere compliments.

05:54.874 --> 05:59.144
[chuckling] Well,
I see the game is afoot.

05:59.178 --> 06:02.213
"Insincere," huh?
I knew you didn't like this dress.

06:02.248 --> 06:04.382
- [stammers]
- Mm-hm?

06:04.416 --> 06:08.018
Juliet, this boy is here to
spy on our establishment.

06:08.052 --> 06:11.588
He's not spying, Daddy.
He's very nice.

06:11.623 --> 06:14.590
He was just videotaping
our menu for his...

06:14.625 --> 06:17.793
You know, things are not
looking good for you.

06:17.827 --> 06:20.262
I'm afraid, Justin Russo,

06:20.296 --> 06:22.397
that I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

06:22.432 --> 06:25.466
If don't, the consequences
will be most horrible

06:25.501 --> 06:27.435
and permanent!

06:27.469 --> 06:30.971
Oh, honey, what did we say
about the hand gestures?

06:31.005 --> 06:32.771
Not in the restaurant.

06:32.806 --> 06:35.106
There you go.

06:37.577 --> 06:39.845
Here, take this.

06:39.879 --> 06:41.947
But this has someone's
phone number on it.

06:41.981 --> 06:45.751
Yeah. It's the cute girl who
works at Late Nite Bite.

06:45.786 --> 06:49.755
Oh. I like her.

06:53.895 --> 06:57.430
The right side of the take-out
menu lists the specials.

06:57.464 --> 07:00.099
Fangs-giving Turkey plate.

07:00.133 --> 07:02.234
The Count of Monte CristoSandwi.

07:03.069 --> 07:07.105
on... "garlic style" bread.

07:08.474 --> 07:11.242
Justin, isn't that all
stuff from the menu?

07:11.276 --> 07:13.144
Why'd you write it
on the white board?

07:13.345 --> 07:16.447
You sent me on a spy mission,
and I'm debriefing you.

07:16.481 --> 07:20.618
Without the board we're just
sitting around looking at menus.

07:21.720 --> 07:25.656
Hold up. "Garlic style?
" "Open all night?"

07:25.690 --> 07:29.660
"Count?" "Fangs?" They're vampires!

07:32.063 --> 07:34.431
The Van Heusens are vampires?

07:34.465 --> 07:37.901
That's why they had fangs.

07:37.936 --> 07:40.237
Thought it was just a theme.

07:42.039 --> 07:45.141
[bad accent] We've got a
vampire war on our hands.

07:46.510 --> 07:48.545
<i>Hasta la vista, baby!</i>

07:50.781 --> 07:52.716
That was the Terminator!

07:53.952 --> 07:56.552
All right, he's gone.
We should pack up and move.

08:02.259 --> 08:04.927
All right. So they're vampires?

08:04.962 --> 08:07.697
It doesn't mean we can't
beat them at their own game.

08:07.731 --> 08:11.600
What do they got?
A castle dungeon theme?

08:11.634 --> 08:14.269
We've got a subway station theme.

08:14.303 --> 08:16.738
All we have to do
is make people feel

08:16.772 --> 08:19.373
like they're really in a New
York City subway station

08:19.407 --> 08:20.674
when they come in here.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.042
You know, complete the
experience for them.

08:23.076 --> 08:25.643
I'll just write that down on the
white board and make it official.

08:26.946 --> 08:28.413
I get it.

08:28.580 --> 08:32.283
We can move the turnstiles by
the bathrooms to the front door.

08:32.317 --> 08:34.116
It'll create a line outside,

08:34.217 --> 08:37.386
make the place look busy,
like those discotheques do.

08:37.421 --> 08:39.789
"Discotheques?"

08:39.823 --> 08:44.059
This could be the worst
family meeting ever.

08:45.496 --> 08:47.397
No. No. It's coming together.

08:47.431 --> 08:51.967
Late Nite Bite, you don't
know what bear you just poked.

08:55.004 --> 08:57.605
[roars]

08:58.941 --> 09:02.245
- I'm the bear.
- Oh.

09:05.017 --> 09:07.618
- [sighs]
- Alex, I need to speak to you.

09:09.488 --> 09:11.189
I've got a date with
Juliet Van Heusen

09:11.457 --> 09:13.190
and I need your help
sneaking around Mom and Dad.

09:13.225 --> 09:15.358
Well, you came to the right place.

09:15.392 --> 09:17.226
You don't want to be caught
dating the competition.

09:17.260 --> 09:19.061
- What do I do?
- Use magic.

09:19.096 --> 09:20.763
- That's it?
- Would you have thought of it?

09:20.797 --> 09:22.966
- Nope.
- OK then.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.969
If there's nothing else,
I've got to get started on my plan

09:26.003 --> 09:28.271
for getting Max and those
annoying impressions

09:28.306 --> 09:29.972
out of the house for the summer.

09:30.007 --> 09:31.674
"I'll be back."

09:31.708 --> 09:34.609
No, you won't, Max. No, you won't.

09:42.549 --> 09:47.519
<i>[Jerry's voice over PA] Waverly Sub Station.
Next stop, delicious.</i>

09:53.358 --> 09:56.660
OK, and here we are.

09:56.694 --> 09:58.928
Can we eat now?

09:58.963 --> 10:02.932
Not yet, sir. First a
little subway entertainment.

10:02.967 --> 10:04.100
Harper, you're on.

10:04.134 --> 10:06.569
And a one, two three...

10:08.872 --> 10:11.006
I love sandwiches.

10:12.576 --> 10:14.310
Why do they call them sandwiches?

10:14.711 --> 10:17.679
They're not made out of sand.
They're not made by witches.

10:17.713 --> 10:19.581
What is the deal?

10:21.417 --> 10:22.984
Jerry Seinfeld.

10:24.786 --> 10:27.288
Please, can I just get some coffee?

10:27.322 --> 10:30.258
Ah... I'll get that for you, sir.

10:30.292 --> 10:33.695
Oh, and you'll get yours,
too, buddy.

10:36.933 --> 10:39.201
So Romeo,

10:39.235 --> 10:41.936
did you figure out how you're
using magic to date Juliet?

10:41.971 --> 10:44.939
Yep. I added five minutes
to the break schedule.

10:44.974 --> 10:47.910
Now when we date,
it'll be for 25 minutes at a time.

10:51.014 --> 10:54.450
You used magic to do this...?

10:56.000 --> 11:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:03.192 --> 11:07.796
Justin, you could have used
magic to... to stop time,

11:07.831 --> 11:10.465
freeze Mom and Dad so
they can't find you,

11:10.500 --> 11:13.669
create an alternate universe
where you and Juliet can date

11:13.704 --> 11:16.706
for a year, but it'd only
be a minute of our time.

11:16.740 --> 11:19.208
Something big and magical.

11:19.243 --> 11:23.279
I also used it to grow two inches.

11:24.648 --> 11:27.750
You are a wiz-idiot.

11:27.784 --> 11:29.252
You know what?

11:29.286 --> 11:31.621
You use magic your way,
I'm gonna use it my way.

11:31.655 --> 11:33.890
[scoffs] Fine, I will.

11:35.826 --> 11:37.393
There.

11:37.428 --> 11:41.064
Now you're two inches shorter,
just like you used to be.

11:41.098 --> 11:43.500
What's up, shorty?

12:10.460 --> 12:12.859
That was the best nightmare ever.

12:37.916 --> 12:39.817
[cell phone ringing]

12:42.553 --> 12:43.720
Hi, Justin.

12:45.022 --> 12:48.190
Wait, you only have 25
minutes for the whole date?

12:48.225 --> 12:51.360
No, OK. We can just
skip the awkward part

12:51.394 --> 12:53.061
and you can hold my hand.

12:54.931 --> 12:57.365
Yeah, I guess that
was kind of awkward.

12:58.233 --> 13:00.134
Hey, got it over with.

13:00.168 --> 13:02.502
All right. See you outside.

13:17.016 --> 13:18.649
Ahh!

13:18.684 --> 13:20.684
AB Positive.

13:37.368 --> 13:39.936
Uh, Juliet?

13:39.970 --> 13:43.372
Yeah, hi. Where do you
think you're going?

13:43.407 --> 13:47.409
Um... I... I was just going

13:47.443 --> 13:50.711
[chuckles] to go wreak
havoc on innocent mortals.

13:50.745 --> 13:52.679
Oh!

13:52.713 --> 13:55.681
Oh, well, good, honey.
Fabulous. Have fun.

13:57.150 --> 13:58.617
Juliet?

14:00.386 --> 14:03.154
If you're sneaking out
to see that Russo boy,

14:03.188 --> 14:04.588
you'll be grounded.

14:04.623 --> 14:08.191
And I mean, in the ground,
this time.

14:09.126 --> 14:11.793
Oh, Daddy, go back to dead.

14:14.931 --> 14:16.731
Wait a minute!

14:17.766 --> 14:19.801
I know what you're doing.

14:19.935 --> 14:22.403
You're sneaking out to do something
your mother wouldn't approve of,

14:22.437 --> 14:26.340
like getting a
frozen hot chocolate.

14:26.374 --> 14:27.908
I'm coming with you!

14:27.942 --> 14:30.644
Go ahead, sneak around,
eat whatever you want...

14:30.678 --> 14:32.879
like I don't notice
how we can't fit into

14:32.914 --> 14:35.380
a queen-sized coffin anymore?

14:35.414 --> 14:38.547
Fine. I'll switch to blood light.

14:43.449 --> 14:45.250
Oh, sweetie, on your way home

14:45.284 --> 14:46.751
could you pick up some detergent?

14:47.219 --> 14:49.086
Your father keeps wiping
his fangs on his cape,

14:49.121 --> 14:51.621
because he's a
little vampire piggy.

14:51.656 --> 14:54.957
- [man] I heard that!
- You were meant to.

15:04.199 --> 15:07.367
Hey, Justin, I don't think
going through the graveyard

15:07.401 --> 15:09.002
is a shortcut to the movies.

15:09.470 --> 15:13.138
But it is, because you tend to
walk faster through a graveyard.

15:13.172 --> 15:14.973
[owl hooting]

15:16.208 --> 15:20.510
I mean, unless you
actually like graveyards.

15:20.545 --> 15:22.012
Do you?

15:22.046 --> 15:25.281
Well, not really as
much as you seem to.

15:25.315 --> 15:29.884
I'm totally... totally cool with
the whole graveyard situation.

15:31.387 --> 15:35.722
You know what? We have,
uh... we have some time to... "kill."

15:35.756 --> 15:38.658
Well, yeah, I guess we could
hang out here for a while.

15:38.692 --> 15:40.660
Aha! You said, "hang."

15:40.694 --> 15:42.961
Most people say, "sit,
" but you said, "hang."

15:42.996 --> 15:44.763
[owl hooting]

15:44.797 --> 15:47.399
Nobody says, "you could
sit out here for a while."

15:47.433 --> 15:50.401
Oh, I get what's happening.

15:50.436 --> 15:52.904
This is the awkward part we talked about,
before we hold hands.

15:52.938 --> 15:54.605
Let's do it. Here...

15:54.773 --> 15:57.442
Oh, should we do the interlocking
fingers or the hand in hand?

15:57.476 --> 16:00.078
Ooh... Which one's less sweaty?

16:01.480 --> 16:04.883
- [chuckles] We're...
- [giggles]

16:04.917 --> 16:10.688
So, um... I'm not sure about
this movie we're gonna see.

16:10.723 --> 16:15.594
I don't think there will be enough,
uh... blood in it for me.

16:15.628 --> 16:17.629
It's a romantic comedy.

16:17.664 --> 16:21.867
No, I'm just saying I'm
totally fine with blood.

16:21.901 --> 16:24.303
It's not a thing. Aren't you?

16:24.337 --> 16:28.940
No. Hey, I was wondering if we
could grab a bite after the movie?

16:28.975 --> 16:31.073
- Aha!
- Aha what?

16:31.107 --> 16:34.008
- You said, "bite!"
- Yeah, I also said "kill"

16:34.042 --> 16:37.278
and "hang," which seem
to be important to you.

16:37.312 --> 16:39.647
Pss! Pss! Pss!

16:39.681 --> 16:42.917
- You know, I don't got any...
- And sleep!

16:42.952 --> 16:44.318
Marvin, what are you doing here?

16:44.553 --> 16:47.051
Ooh! I see you brought us a snack!

16:47.086 --> 16:49.151
No, he's not a snack, he's my date.

16:49.186 --> 16:50.619
We're going to the movies.

16:50.820 --> 16:52.753
Ooh! Make sure he
eats a lot of popcorn.

16:52.788 --> 16:55.155
I like my blood buttery.

16:55.190 --> 16:59.993
Marvin, you heard her.
She's on a date. Leave her alone.

17:00.027 --> 17:02.729
Hey, Juliet.
How's your mom and dad?

17:02.763 --> 17:05.065
Is she still trying
to play the piano?

17:06.567 --> 17:09.469
I haven't seen them
in centuries. [laughs]

17:09.503 --> 17:11.271
- [snoring]
- Yeah, they're pretty much

17:11.306 --> 17:13.040
the same, you know..

17:13.074 --> 17:16.443
Dad tries to be scary
and mom calms him down.

17:16.477 --> 17:18.045
Nothing's really changed.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.846
But you guys have to go!

17:21.415 --> 17:24.446
- Awake.
- ...problem with dead things.

17:25.848 --> 17:27.150
Do you?

17:27.184 --> 17:29.587
Yeah, the place gives
me the creeps. Let's go.

17:29.621 --> 17:31.721
Yeah, it's kinda scary.

17:31.755 --> 17:34.057
Bye, Mary! Bye Marvin!

17:42.867 --> 17:46.702
OK, that'll be $6.50 out of...

17:46.736 --> 17:50.806
one million dollars.

17:52.642 --> 17:55.343
Doctor Evil.

17:56.711 --> 17:58.710
<i>Austin Powers.</i>

18:04.348 --> 18:08.184
And that's the definition
of the word, "definition."

18:08.218 --> 18:10.352
[laughing]

18:10.387 --> 18:13.555
What would be the definition
of the word, "word?"

18:13.589 --> 18:17.491
Where have you been all my life?

18:17.525 --> 18:21.826
If I told you, you probably
wouldn't believe me.

18:23.362 --> 18:27.664
Juliet, I, uh...
I know you're a vampire.

18:27.698 --> 18:30.899
OK, so you probably
would believe me.

18:30.933 --> 18:35.335
And while we're on the subject,
I know you're a wizard.

18:35.370 --> 18:37.338
I can tell by your scent.

18:37.372 --> 18:41.511
Sorry... I've been slicing ham.

18:44.648 --> 18:47.750
No. your wizard scent.
Part brick, part pine needle.

18:47.784 --> 18:50.152
Vampires have a
strong sense of smell.

18:50.186 --> 18:52.988
Stronger than werewolves,
but people don't want to get past the fangs

18:53.022 --> 18:55.123
and the blood drinking
to learn the specifics.

18:56.758 --> 19:00.728
You know, you're not how I
expected vampires to be.

19:00.762 --> 19:06.366
Well, that's because my parents wanted
me to fit in better d gave me a soul.

19:06.401 --> 19:08.168
I have feelings.

19:08.202 --> 19:10.103
And what do your feelings tell you?

19:10.137 --> 19:12.438
That we should do this again.

19:12.472 --> 19:14.039
[laughs]

19:14.073 --> 19:17.108
But... [sighs] Your
parents don't like me.

19:17.143 --> 19:20.277
And my parents wouldn't like it if I was
going out with a competitor's daughter.

19:20.312 --> 19:23.682
I'm sorry. I don't care what Mommy
and Dad have to say about this.

19:23.715 --> 19:25.849
I am going to tell them about you.

19:25.883 --> 19:29.488
You know what? I'm going
to tell my parents, too.

19:29.520 --> 19:33.190
Then we can have a date that lasts
longer than my 25-minute break from work.

19:33.224 --> 19:35.692
It was fun. I've never
gone to the movies

19:35.727 --> 19:38.628
just to see the coming
attractions before.

19:38.663 --> 19:41.765
Although we could have
gotten a smaller popcorn.

19:41.799 --> 19:44.801
Hey, the fun part was you.

19:47.405 --> 19:50.007
[sighs] I don't wa to say goodbye.

19:50.041 --> 19:52.309
Neither do I.

19:52.343 --> 19:57.414
OK, how about we count to
three and turn and walk away.

19:57.448 --> 20:01.116
[giggles] You said "Count."

20:06.056 --> 20:09.425
- "Count?" [laughs]
- Good one.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.327
OK, I gotta go.

20:11.361 --> 20:13.329
I'd hug you, but I don't want
to get my wizard scent on you

20:13.363 --> 20:15.231
before you tell your parents.

20:15.265 --> 20:17.033
Thinking!

20:17.067 --> 20:20.703
How about, um,
I give you a mind hug?

20:20.737 --> 20:24.407
OK. I'll give you one, too.

20:25.909 --> 20:29.045
Oh... That's nice.

20:29.079 --> 20:33.019
Romeo, Juliet, let's wrap
it up with the looky-looks.

20:33.054 --> 20:36.284
Oh, hey, Oprah.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.289
That's not Oprah. That's Alex.

20:38.323 --> 20:42.258
No, that's Oprah. She comes
in and orrs the Nosfera-Tuna.

20:42.293 --> 20:45.163
[chuckles] It's hilarious
when they call out "Oprah"

20:45.197 --> 20:47.600
and everybody looks
around and it's just me.

20:48.536 --> 20:50.204
Oh, that's never not funny.

20:57.246 --> 21:01.282
Ah! Harper. u're getting
really good at that.

21:01.316 --> 21:02.650
I am?

21:02.784 --> 21:06.419
No. Of course not.
This whole subway theme is stupid.

21:09.356 --> 21:12.658
Mom, Dad, I've gotta talk to
you about the Van Heusens.

21:12.692 --> 21:14.459
Have you figured out
a way to destroy them

21:14.727 --> 21:17.394
and send them into t
bowels of the Earth?

21:17.428 --> 21:21.165
No, actually. Not all the
Van Heusens are evil.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.436
What? They have stolen
all our business

21:23.471 --> 21:26.004
and forced us into
this subway nonsense.

21:26.039 --> 21:28.807
I've hated that car since
I rst heard someone

21:28.841 --> 21:32.411
at an auction say, "Sold.
To the guy eating a sandwich."

21:32.444 --> 21:35.612
I got a great deal.
They included the tow.

21:37.182 --> 21:39.148
The Van Heusens are evil.

21:39.183 --> 21:41.317
And so is anybody relad to them,

21:41.351 --> 21:43.119
friends with them,
or eats at their restaurant.

21:44.355 --> 21:46.924
Now, what did you want
to tell us, honey?

21:46.958 --> 21:50.828
That... uh...

21:50.862 --> 21:54.599
the average temperature of an
igloo is 61 degrees Fahrenheit

21:54.633 --> 21:57.537
when there's people in it.
That's ice!

21:57.571 --> 22:01.142
That's nice, sweetie.
Maybe someday you can grow up,

22:01.176 --> 22:06.882
buy an igloo at an auction and build a
whole restaurant around it, just like your
father.

22:06.916 --> 22:08.983
I am an entrepreneur!

22:09.018 --> 22:13.388
Dude! you can't come
clean about Juliet.

22:13.422 --> 22:15.758
When they find out,
there's gonna be chaos.

22:16.159 --> 22:19.994
And that's the chaos I'm going to need to
cover my plan to send Max away for the
summer.

22:20.028 --> 22:23.997
There's this magical, underwater
seahorse ranch th's all filled up,

22:24.032 --> 22:27.367
but I've got him slowly
moving up that wait list...

22:27.401 --> 22:28.267
[spluttering]

22:28.435 --> 22:31.939
Giddy-up, Max. Giddy-up!

22:34.675 --> 22:37.978
Justin, I told my parents.

22:38.012 --> 22:40.246
Wow, that was quick.

22:40.280 --> 22:42.581
Didn't take long to say,
"I like Justin."

22:42.615 --> 22:44.849
And for them to say, "What?!"

22:44.884 --> 22:46.251
How did your parents take it?

22:46.285 --> 22:48.652
Yeah, um...

22:48.687 --> 22:50.787
I'm gonna need another day with it.

22:50.822 --> 22:53.156
I don't think you're going
to have another day.

22:53.190 --> 22:55.758
You might have another five
seconds to squeeze it in.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.292
What are you talking about?

23:00.796 --> 23:04.131
We've come to reclaim our daughter!

23:07.835 --> 23:09.636
Yeah.

23:11.005 --> 23:14.507
- Who are you?
- Alucard Van Heusen.

23:14.541 --> 23:17.843
And this is my wife, Cindy. Hi.

23:18.945 --> 23:21.413
Of all the sneaky tricks to use.

23:21.447 --> 23:24.983
Sending ur boy over to play
with my Juliet's affections.

23:25.017 --> 23:28.419
That is w, even for a wizard.

23:30.922 --> 23:33.957
Like six feet in the ground low?
Huh, vampire?

23:33.991 --> 23:36.726
Honey, you may want to
stay out of this one.

23:36.760 --> 23:41.297
Your husband's right.
You've unleashed the wrath of Alucard.

23:44.166 --> 23:47.901
Please pretend you're scared or I'll
have to hear about it all night.

23:48.903 --> 23:53.672
Prepare to meet your doom!

23:53.707 --> 23:55.975
Oh, look. Oprah's here.

23:56.009 --> 23:58.777
Hi, Al. Cindy.

24:00.246 --> 24:01.846
Well, let's cut to it.

24:01.880 --> 24:03.714
Your son needs to stay
away from our daughter.

24:04.382 --> 24:06.817
She doesn't know what she's doing.
Her fangs haven't even come in yet.

24:08.853 --> 24:10.820
You're dating the competition?

24:10.855 --> 24:13.589
How could you do this to us?

24:13.624 --> 24:16.392
I might have expected
this from Alex, but you?

24:16.428 --> 24:20.263
What? Yeah, that's totally
something I would do.

24:24.166 --> 24:26.467
Dad, we really like each other.

24:26.505 --> 24:29.836
Oh, I get it.

24:29.871 --> 24:33.107
You sent your daughter here
to make him fall in love

24:33.141 --> 24:37.277
as part of your sick plan...
to destroy us.

24:37.312 --> 24:39.013
How would that destroy us?

24:40.815 --> 24:42.082
They're vampires!

24:43.485 --> 24:47.154
They're handsomer, smarter,
and more cunning than we are.

24:47.189 --> 24:52.259
They're like... shaved
wolves that can vote.

24:53.861 --> 24:56.496
Daddy, Mom, the moments
I've spent with Justin

24:56.530 --> 24:59.032
have been the best 25
minutes of my life.

25:00.468 --> 25:04.370
Well, those moments
are over. Come on.

25:05.472 --> 25:07.206
- [window thumping]
- [bats squeaking]

25:07.241 --> 25:09.475
Daddy.

25:18.719 --> 25:21.755
Smarter than us, huh? Really?

25:32.358 --> 25:35.327
Excuse me. Can you
turn down that sound?

25:35.361 --> 25:38.930
Yeah, I get it. It's a subway.
I just want my coffee.

25:38.964 --> 25:42.699
Look, we're selling the experience
of being underground in a subway,

25:42.734 --> 25:46.836
and friendly, courteous service,
so shut up and enjoy it.

25:50.207 --> 25:52.575
I know what you're thinking,

25:52.609 --> 25:56.145
that I'm threatened by this new girl
that's become a part of Justin's life.

25:56.179 --> 25:59.314
Well, I'm not. He likes to
dabble with the exotic types,

25:59.348 --> 26:02.049
the werewolves,
the centaurs and the vampires.

26:02.083 --> 26:05.718
But "Old Steady" is
gonna win this race.

26:07.888 --> 26:09.455
Good for you, Harper.

26:09.489 --> 26:12.757
You want to know who Old
Steady is? This girl.

26:21.099 --> 26:22.666
[whispering] Oh, Juliet.

26:24.202 --> 26:26.902
Oh, Justin.

26:29.539 --> 26:31.539
Juliet, what are you doing?

26:31.574 --> 26:36.376
Staring at nothing. 'Cause
that's all I have, is nothing.

26:36.411 --> 26:39.446
No, you're staring at a bat cage.

26:39.480 --> 26:41.381
OK, if you don't want me
to stare at a bat cage

26:41.415 --> 26:42.715
and you don't want
me to date Justin,

26:43.250 --> 26:44.283
I might as well stare at this wall.

26:44.718 --> 26:48.053
Whoo! I had no idea 2,
000 years of adolescence

26:48.088 --> 26:49.621
would be this difficult.

26:49.656 --> 26:52.423
Really, Juliet,
stop being so dramatic.

26:52.458 --> 26:55.326
Wonder where she gets that?

26:55.360 --> 26:58.330
And Juliet, if you don't
stop staring at this wall,

26:58.364 --> 27:00.997
I shall take a wrecking ball to it!

27:01.032 --> 27:04.534
I would actually like that.
Then I could see Justin through it!

27:04.568 --> 27:07.503
Sweetie, I know you're upset, I do.

27:07.537 --> 27:10.239
But I don't know why you're
so infatuated with him.

27:10.273 --> 27:13.608
He's fangless and has
no pasty complexion.

27:15.277 --> 27:18.312
OK, well you two have been
together for 10,000 years.

27:18.346 --> 27:21.648
You've forgotten how hard it
is to meet someone special.

27:21.682 --> 27:24.050
Well, don't worry about it,
darling.

27:24.084 --> 27:25.484
You'll meet someone else.

27:25.619 --> 27:27.754
There are other bats in the cave.

27:30.323 --> 27:35.325
Yes, there are plenty of young dapper
fellows who come in here all the time.

27:35.359 --> 27:38.360
Well, look. Look at him.
He's perfect.

27:38.395 --> 27:40.095
- Him? No. No!
- Oh!

27:40.129 --> 27:41.530
- He's perfect!
- Not him.

27:41.564 --> 27:43.499
Hello, young man. Yes, hi.

27:43.533 --> 27:46.470
I'd like to introduce you
to our daughter, Juliet.

27:46.504 --> 27:51.008
Great... I think this is diet.

27:51.042 --> 27:55.078
What are you guys trying to do? He's,
like, 45 years old.

27:55.112 --> 27:57.949
Yes, but you're 2000.
What difference does it make?

27:57.984 --> 28:00.752
He's not Justin.
That's the difference.

28:02.188 --> 28:05.022
I've been alive for a long time
and I've never felt this way.

28:05.057 --> 28:07.057
You can't just push someone on me.

28:07.092 --> 28:09.193
'Twas fate's dart
that found my Justin.

28:09.227 --> 28:11.830
[scoffs] Remember,
you're a teenager.

28:11.865 --> 28:17.169
It was, like, totally, fate's dart
that found Justin and stuff, you know?

28:17.203 --> 28:19.571
We're done with this discussion.

28:19.605 --> 28:22.106
Get your mind off this
and get back to work.

28:22.141 --> 28:24.508
That man needs a regular soda!

28:24.543 --> 28:26.810
What's the point of working
if I don't have a future?

28:26.845 --> 28:29.880
If I can't be with Justin,
I'd rather die!

28:29.915 --> 28:31.148
Again!

28:31.182 --> 28:35.419
Oh! Oh! So dramatic!
[dramatic laughter]

28:42.093 --> 28:45.595
The specials today are...

28:45.630 --> 28:49.232
What am I talking about?
There's nothing special about today.

28:49.267 --> 28:51.568
There's nothing special
about tomorrow.

28:51.602 --> 28:54.270
There's nothing special ever.

29:01.345 --> 29:02.911
Oh, my gosh, Justin.

29:02.946 --> 29:05.480
You've got to get over
your 25-minute girlfriend.

29:07.383 --> 29:09.384
You know what I figured out?

29:09.419 --> 29:11.954
I fall in love fast.

29:11.988 --> 29:14.423
But you know what's
different about this time?

29:14.457 --> 29:16.558
When I'm not with her...

29:18.294 --> 29:20.461
...my heart hurts.

29:25.702 --> 29:28.036
I believe you.

29:28.071 --> 29:30.638
Normally you pout for 30 minutes,

29:30.673 --> 29:32.874
and then I wave an action
figure in front of your face

29:32.908 --> 29:34.108
and you're fine.

29:35.644 --> 29:37.945
Not this time.

29:37.979 --> 29:40.948
This is one crime Captain Jim
Bob Sherwood can't solve.

29:40.982 --> 29:43.117
Oh my gosh, please come with me.

29:46.421 --> 29:50.390
OK. Put these on.

29:50.425 --> 29:54.261
- Why?
- Because I'm going to help you.

29:54.295 --> 29:56.496
Why?

29:56.531 --> 29:58.965
Because your sadness
grosses me out. OK?

30:03.271 --> 30:06.307
There. Now you and Juliet
can continue to date.

30:06.341 --> 30:11.612
While you have the glasses on, everybody
will see you as a completely different
person.

30:14.916 --> 30:16.851
Oh, but those glasses
are on a loan.

30:16.885 --> 30:18.986
I'm going to need them
back at a moment's notice.

30:19.020 --> 30:21.088
Why?

30:21.122 --> 30:23.724
It's a part of my plan
to get rid of Max.

30:23.959 --> 30:27.527
There's this guy coming over whose kid is
number one on the wait-list for seahorse
camp.

30:27.562 --> 30:30.130
He has to think I'm camp director.

30:31.065 --> 30:32.999
That didn't make any sense.

30:33.501 --> 30:36.403
That's why I need the glasses, dude. If
those words don't come out of a grown-up's
mouth

30:36.438 --> 30:40.741
we're stuck with Jerry "the
Terminator" Seinfeld all summer.

30:40.775 --> 30:42.809
[choking up] And I just can't...

30:47.815 --> 30:51.585
So there we were, yelling,
"The British are coming!"

30:51.619 --> 30:55.822
You were there, in 1776,
during the Revolutionary War?

30:55.856 --> 30:57.757
I thought it was just Paul Revere.

30:57.791 --> 30:59.859
Yeah, Paul "Check me
out over here" Revere.

30:59.894 --> 31:02.429
That guy was such an attention hog.

31:04.999 --> 31:09.869
Oh! Hey, it's true.
Vampires don't show up in mirrors.

31:09.903 --> 31:13.539
Yeah, doing our hair
is total guesswork.

31:13.573 --> 31:15.908
But hey, I mean...

31:17.477 --> 31:20.512
Look at Juliet with that new boy.

31:20.547 --> 31:22.414
They're so sweet together.

31:22.448 --> 31:24.816
Juliet really seems
to be enjoying him.

31:24.850 --> 31:26.517
I knew we did the right thing,

31:26.552 --> 31:29.955
keeping her away from
that Russo urchin.

31:29.989 --> 31:35.127
And you know I could have unleashed
my wrath on him any time I wanted to.

31:35.162 --> 31:37.230
I know, honey. OK.

31:39.867 --> 31:42.168
- [head clangs]
- Oh, God!

31:46.773 --> 31:49.609
Psst! Justin, it's time.
Give me the glasses.

31:49.643 --> 31:52.178
Uh. I'm in the middle of something.

31:52.212 --> 31:55.347
Sheriff boy's father's here.
It's now or never.

32:01.254 --> 32:04.289
Good luck, you two.
I'm rooting for you.

32:04.324 --> 32:07.125
[gasps] Justin Russo!

32:08.894 --> 32:10.795
A wizard trick. [hisses]

32:10.829 --> 32:15.099
Juliet, get away from him.
We forbade you to see him.

32:15.134 --> 32:18.869
Sorry, sir. But I would never do anything
to harm your daughter or your business.

32:18.903 --> 32:24.275
We thought she was with a nice
boy from... [hisses]...school.

32:24.309 --> 32:27.511
That's what I've been trying
to tell you. He is a nice boy.

32:27.545 --> 32:30.080
There's no difference between
Justin and the boy you saw.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.849
Why can't you just let us be happy?

32:33.685 --> 32:35.719
With all due respect, Mr.
and Mrs. Van Heusen,

32:35.853 --> 32:38.254
this restaurant feud is
between you and my parents.

32:38.289 --> 32:40.490
Juliet and I have
nothing to do with it.

32:41.959 --> 32:45.662
Please let us be together.
I really care about Juliet.

32:45.696 --> 32:47.931
- Uh...
- Mmmm...

32:47.965 --> 32:50.566
Uh...

32:51.435 --> 32:54.437
Oh, Come on, Alucard.

32:54.471 --> 32:57.473
You're an old romantic softie.

32:58.975 --> 33:03.146
Remember when we were young and in love,
like, 1,000 years ago?

33:04.715 --> 33:08.617
Seems like just yesterday we
were drinking King Arthur.

33:10.587 --> 33:13.188
Is that a brand of soda?

33:13.222 --> 33:16.158
Yes, as far as you know.

33:17.727 --> 33:20.529
You can see Juliet
as often as you want.

33:20.564 --> 33:25.167
But remember, I am capable
of unleashing my wrath

33:25.201 --> 33:26.969
as long as I'm not distracted.

33:27.003 --> 33:32.641
Hey, it's not unlimited sauces.
You get one.

33:33.977 --> 33:36.979
Way to unleash that wrath.

33:37.013 --> 33:39.481
You've inspired me, Mr.
and Mrs. Van Heusen.

33:39.516 --> 33:41.750
I'm sure when my parents see
how happy I am with Juliet

33:41.784 --> 33:43.785
they'll be just as
accepting as you are.

33:45.988 --> 33:47.656
Absolutely not.

33:49.124 --> 33:50.424
What are you thinking?

33:50.792 --> 33:52.326
Those people are trying
to steal our business!

33:53.128 --> 33:56.731
We will not let you betray this family,
Justin. I don't care how happy you are.

33:56.765 --> 33:58.466
Well, as a mother,
I care about your happiness.

33:58.634 --> 34:01.068
But as a restaurant owner, I don't.

34:01.103 --> 34:05.505
The Van Heusens were accepting,
loving and tolerant of us.

34:05.540 --> 34:07.207
And they sleep in coffins!

34:07.241 --> 34:09.976
They're actually
roomier than you think.

34:10.011 --> 34:15.282
With the lid open and with bedding,
you barely notice it's a coffin.

34:17.985 --> 34:20.053
I could have never
seen this coming.

34:20.088 --> 34:24.625
Alex, you are officially the
good child of the family.

34:24.659 --> 34:27.661
- "Good child?"
- Mm-hm.

34:27.696 --> 34:30.364
You're calling me the good child?

34:30.398 --> 34:35.002
Think about that.
What has Justin done wrong?

34:35.036 --> 34:37.938
He fell in love with
somebody. Big deal.

34:37.973 --> 34:40.574
I'm the one who's been
trying to get Max sent off

34:40.608 --> 34:43.177
to an undersea camp for the summer.

34:43.210 --> 34:45.579
You're trying to get
rid of your brother?

34:45.612 --> 34:47.880
Yeah, but it didn't
really work out.

34:47.915 --> 34:51.985
The, uh, wizard kid's father
actually was a wizard cop.

34:52.018 --> 34:56.556
He recognized my voice from something
else you don't want to know about.

34:58.227 --> 35:02.464
Look, Daddy, Justin should
be allowed to date Juliet

35:02.498 --> 35:06.668
and you guys should be
focused on punishing me

35:06.702 --> 35:10.205
for what I almost did to Max,
and the other thing that I did.

35:11.941 --> 35:14.742
She's right, Jerry.

35:14.777 --> 35:17.712
Our feud with the Van
Heusens has blinded us

35:17.746 --> 35:20.415
to something a little
more important.

35:21.884 --> 35:24.553
Our son's happiness.

35:24.587 --> 35:27.756
Justin, Juliet...
You guys can date.

35:27.791 --> 35:29.224
[both] Yes! Whoo!

35:29.325 --> 35:32.627
- [Juliet] So it's official.
- Not until...

35:32.661 --> 35:34.462
...I write it on the white board.

35:36.432 --> 35:38.433
Some people might find that weird,

35:38.467 --> 35:40.502
but I just think it's charming.

35:40.536 --> 35:42.170
I'll hold the marker cap.

35:45.441 --> 35:47.542
I see what you did here.

35:47.577 --> 35:50.646
You made a sacrifice
for your brother.

35:52.282 --> 35:54.783
You really are the good child.

35:54.817 --> 35:57.419
Daddy, please don't say that.
Makes me uncomfortable.

35:57.453 --> 35:59.020
I know, that's why I'm
gonna keep saying it.

35:59.188 --> 36:00.288
- You're the good child.
- Daddy...

36:00.656 --> 36:02.424
- You're the good child.
- Stop it!

36:02.458 --> 36:04.293
- Alex is good!
- No!

36:04.327 --> 36:05.794
Someone did something good.
It's Alex!

36:06.263 --> 36:08.464
- No, I did not do that!
- Yes! You're good!

36:10.146 --> 36:13.448
And that's the definition
of the word "the."

36:15.484 --> 36:17.151
What's going on?

36:17.186 --> 36:19.120
Alex almost sent you
away to an undersea camp

36:19.154 --> 36:20.955
where everyone rides seahorses.

36:23.725 --> 36:28.395
Oh, my gosh. I would love that!

36:29.864 --> 36:33.367
Oh, Alex, you are a great sister.
You're really great.

36:33.401 --> 36:36.103
I'm gonna work on an
impression of you all summer.

36:37.673 --> 36:39.640
Max, please.
I'm begging you not to.

36:39.674 --> 36:43.478
"Max, please.
I'm begging you not to."

36:43.512 --> 36:44.579
Please leave me alone.

36:45.648 --> 36:47.282
"Please leave me alone."

36:47.316 --> 36:48.783
- Stop it!
- "Stop it!"

36:48.818 --> 36:50.652
- Stop!
- "Stop!"
