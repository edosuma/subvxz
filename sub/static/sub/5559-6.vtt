WEBVTT

00:00.968 --> 00:03.271
Previously on
Minority Report...

00:03.304 --> 00:05.273
(faint, overlapping voices)

00:05.306 --> 00:07.408
We promised not to intervene
in their affairs.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.610
You brought a cop?
We can trust her.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.279
VEGA:
Your secret's safe with me.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.481
ARTHUR:
Vega? Are you sure?

00:13.514 --> 00:15.049
She's there
when they put us in it.

00:15.083 --> 00:16.384
ARTHUR:
Every time we help her,

00:16.417 --> 00:18.519
we risk putting ourselves closer
to the edge.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.721
VEGA: You said
someone hired you

00:20.754 --> 00:23.391
to kill my dad. Who?

00:23.424 --> 00:26.694
WINTER: Lycon.
(two gunshots)

00:26.727 --> 00:29.097
She will betray us, Arthur.
DASH: I miss home, Agatha.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.265
I miss you.

00:31.299 --> 00:32.666
AGATHA:
You forget where I live.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.068
Actually, I don't.
You live on the Island

00:34.102 --> 00:35.703
of Misfit Toys,
filled with people

00:35.736 --> 00:37.571
running away from the
government, not those in it.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.840
AGATHA: You know, for months
after they set us free,

00:39.873 --> 00:42.510
I was afraid to close my eyes.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.512
All the death we'd seen, I...

00:44.545 --> 00:46.547
I thought
it's all I'd ever see again.

00:47.615 --> 00:50.151
(birds calling)

01:08.869 --> 01:11.405
(snorts gently)

01:23.484 --> 01:26.154
MAN: You don't look
like a horse thief.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.291
I'm not.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.692
Steady.

01:31.725 --> 01:34.362
Steady.

01:34.395 --> 01:35.496
She's not broken.

01:35.529 --> 01:36.730
That's... good, right?

01:36.764 --> 01:37.731
Depends on
who you ask.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.200
For her, maybe so.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.434
Keeps getting
out, but I can't

01:40.468 --> 01:41.635
put a bridle on her.

01:41.669 --> 01:44.872
(neighing softly)

01:44.905 --> 01:46.407
You know horses?

01:46.440 --> 01:48.876
Just this one.

01:48.909 --> 01:51.212
She have a name?
Mercury.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.813
Do you?

01:54.848 --> 01:56.184
Agatha.

01:56.184 --> 01:58.452
Agatha. Well, I'm Brian.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.321
Are you looking
for work, Agatha?

02:00.354 --> 02:02.456
Not too many people have
a way with animals.

02:02.490 --> 02:03.757
If you're interested,

02:03.791 --> 02:05.193
I could teach you more.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.598
Is it always this quiet
around here?

02:10.631 --> 02:11.899
Yeah.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.602
That's what I like
about it, too.

02:16.270 --> 02:19.273
(kettle whistling)

02:36.257 --> 02:38.726
(gasping)

02:42.996 --> 02:45.799
(gasping)

02:45.833 --> 02:48.736
(distorted):
No, Katie!

02:48.769 --> 02:50.438
BRIAN:
Katie.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.406
You're okay.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.642
KATIE: No! No!
Katie! Katie!

02:54.675 --> 02:56.244
(gasps)

02:59.847 --> 03:02.483
Brian.

03:04.518 --> 03:08.322
VEGA: There were three of them:
Dash, Arthur and Agatha.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.758
They were called
the Precognitives.

03:10.791 --> 03:13.494
They could see murders
before they happened.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.764
For six years, our police
held them against their will

03:16.797 --> 03:18.832
and used them to save lives.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.935
But after the government's
Precrime program was shut down,

03:21.969 --> 03:24.004
they were finally released.

03:24.037 --> 03:27.475
They kept themselves safe
and hidden from the world,

03:27.508 --> 03:29.510
until now.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.884
AKEELA:
Up all night again?

03:36.917 --> 03:40.354
No, I was just, um...

03:40.388 --> 03:41.955
Obsessing over
your father's case files?

03:41.989 --> 03:43.757
It's just, there's nothing
in any of these

03:43.791 --> 03:46.594
about the blind drug dealer
Dina Winter talked about, Lycon.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.596
Because the files
are just shells.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.764
Most of the data
didn't get converted during

03:50.798 --> 03:52.800
the system upgrade
15 years ago.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.569
So until someone syncs
the two,

03:55.603 --> 03:58.339
the old evidence
might as well be stuck on Mars.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.674
We know how to get to Mars.
We do.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.876
But who knows this system
better than me?

04:02.910 --> 04:04.312
Look,

04:04.345 --> 04:06.647
we're gonna get this guy, Lara.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.948
I promise.

04:11.452 --> 04:14.622
You need to get away from this.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.491
I'll let you know
if I find anything.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.567
You're early.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.636
You're late. There's
only one ferry a day

04:28.669 --> 04:30.971
to the island, and we still
have a car ride to make.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.673
I'm almost ready.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.041
Brian Stanton's daughter?

04:34.074 --> 04:35.909
Nine years old.

04:35.943 --> 04:36.944
Agatha-- how's she holding up?

04:36.977 --> 04:38.779
It's her first death
in a decade,

04:38.812 --> 04:40.948
and it's her old boss's kid,
to boot. How do you think?

04:40.981 --> 04:44.051
If you're coming along,
she must be pretty shaken up.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.052
She is.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.987
Ready?

04:47.020 --> 04:48.389
(Vega clears throat)

04:50.824 --> 04:51.759
Now I am.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.695
So, uh... road trip.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.564
Seriously?

04:56.597 --> 04:58.432
She's a professional.

04:58.466 --> 05:00.368
We're gonna stop this,
we'll need help.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.636
If you think
Agatha's shaken up now,

05:02.670 --> 05:05.373
ooh, you just wait.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.749
There's no signal.

05:15.783 --> 05:18.018
Don't expect much service
on Fiddler's Neck.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.654
People out here
like peace and quiet.

05:20.688 --> 05:24.057
There's peace and quiet, and
then there's the Stone Age.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.727
More like the age
of climate change.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.663
Ice caps melt, waters rise.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.400
A peninsula becomes an island.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.834
Rough on the condo market.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.903
And then the government
gave up,

05:35.936 --> 05:37.605
more or less.

05:37.638 --> 05:40.608
So if there's no government,
then who makes the rules?

05:40.641 --> 05:42.943
Who's in charge?

05:42.976 --> 05:45.112
DASH: They're called the Guard.
ARTHUR: They named themselves.

05:45.145 --> 05:46.847
A little much,
if you ask me.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.417
They make sure no one
brings in any contraband--

05:49.417 --> 05:51.719
GMOs, nanotech,
anything that's dangerous

05:51.752 --> 05:54.154
to the island's more
natural way of life.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.156
And they don't much like
outsiders here either,

05:56.189 --> 05:58.959
so just follow our lead.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.629
Come on, move along.
Let's go.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.037
Well, look who came to visit.
Arthur, been forever.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.104
Fetts.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.139
Slash.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.774
Hello.
You're in the Guard now?

06:13.807 --> 06:15.108
We all got to grow up sometime.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.010
Just took me until I was 36.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.679
Too bad.
I liked you as a young idiot.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.614
Eh. Who's your friend?

06:20.648 --> 06:21.782
And, uh,

06:21.815 --> 06:22.883
what's that?

06:22.916 --> 06:24.785
Police issue.
Don't worry.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.988
It's nonlethal. I mean,
unless I shoot it at you.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.122
Cop.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.991
Detective Vega's here
to start fresh.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.793
Can't sleep in the city
anymore.

06:32.826 --> 06:33.827
Angry all the time.

06:33.861 --> 06:36.096
We told her
that Fiddler's Neck was

06:36.129 --> 06:38.031
just the place
for new beginnings.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.536
Well, if you two vouch for her.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.572
I'll see you around, boys.

06:48.776 --> 06:49.743
Slash?

06:49.777 --> 06:51.078
It's a nickname.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.681
Meant to be ironic.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.015
(chuckles)

07:04.858 --> 07:06.594
DASH:
Don't worry.

07:06.627 --> 07:07.728
She's gonna like you.

07:07.761 --> 07:08.896
Unless she jumps
into your future

07:08.929 --> 07:10.698
and sees you
betray us.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.700
She still believes that?

07:12.733 --> 07:14.702
Maybe after this,
she'll trust me.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.704
(chuckles)
Right.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.749
Guess that's gonna happen
a lot this weekend.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.951
I saw you through the window.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.786
Oh.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.657
But I didn't see this coming.
You called for help

07:36.690 --> 07:38.526
to stop a murder;
that's what Vega does.

07:38.526 --> 07:39.827
I called you.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.832
I wasn't crazy
about it either, Ag.

07:44.865 --> 07:45.999
VEGA:
Can I interview the witness?

07:46.033 --> 07:47.868
Please?

07:47.901 --> 07:51.071
The murder hasn't happened yet.
There are no witnesses.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.606
There's one.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.748
(insects trilling)

08:00.781 --> 08:02.616
VEGA:
I know you don't work like them,

08:02.650 --> 08:04.151
that you see
what the victim sees.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.554
And I feel
what the victim feels.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.856
That you become her
for a moment-- the moment.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.724
You could
call it that.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.192
I die.

08:12.225 --> 08:13.794
(thunder rumbling softly)

08:13.827 --> 08:15.796
We call that
an eyewitness.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.665
So you're in your bedroom.

08:17.698 --> 08:21.602
Is it day or night?
Can you tell what time it is?

08:21.635 --> 08:23.871
I heard a whip-poor-will.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.973
It's a local bird
that makes its call

08:26.006 --> 08:27.575
just around sunset.
That gives us

08:27.608 --> 08:28.842
until tomorrow night, at least.

08:28.876 --> 08:30.844
Or it already happened.
It didn't.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.946
What else did you see?

08:34.882 --> 08:38.185
You hang in there, okay? Please.
AGATHA: Parents leaning over me.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.020
It's okay, sweetie.
Everything's gonna be okay.
They look so scared.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.689
I'm afraid, too.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.091
I don't think
anyone killed me yet.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.059
(thunder rumbling softly)

08:46.093 --> 08:47.695
I'm just sick.

08:47.728 --> 08:48.929
My stomach.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.964
Sick?
But you wouldn't see anything

08:50.998 --> 08:52.265
unless it was a murder.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.801
VEGA:
But your stomach hurts.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.836
Poison.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.606
Did someone poison you?
Did someone give you drugs?

08:58.606 --> 09:00.040
Maybe your mom
or your dad?

09:00.073 --> 09:02.042
My mother doesn't believe
in drugs.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.877
What about your father?

09:04.912 --> 09:08.181
Was it him? Did he poison you?

09:13.386 --> 09:14.688
It was him, wasn't it?

09:14.722 --> 09:15.723
Brian?

09:15.756 --> 09:16.857
The father.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.225
AGATHA:
You don't know

09:18.258 --> 09:20.260
what you're talking about.
Then tell me.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.262
Are you sure it isn't him?
How do you know?

09:22.295 --> 09:26.033
Because I know Brian,
and he would never do that.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.267
Excuse me.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.750
How well did you know Brian?

09:45.753 --> 09:48.088
I'm not sure
who you think you are.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.157
A cop, trying to stop a little
girl from being poisoned.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.158
And it matters.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.994
What are you hiding?

09:54.027 --> 09:56.797
Was he married
at the time?

09:56.830 --> 09:59.166
No.
Do Dash and Arthur

09:59.199 --> 10:00.901
know you were in
love with him?

10:07.007 --> 10:08.308
No.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.077
Well, they came a
long way to help you,

10:10.110 --> 10:11.879
so you better tell them.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.614
We need to work together if
we want to save this child.

10:26.894 --> 10:29.229
BRIAN: Agatha,
you should have come.
How was she?

10:29.262 --> 10:31.264
She was beautiful.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.867
I thought the last of those
cows had gone extinct.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.769
I mean, even when
I was a kid,

10:35.803 --> 10:37.971
you didn't see
Randall Linebacks anymore.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.406
People stopped
eating real beef

10:39.439 --> 10:41.775
'cause that vat-grown
stuff was so cheap.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.410
But there she was.

10:43.443 --> 10:44.678
(chuckles)
Sorry.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.146
Sometimes I go overboard.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.815
You love your work.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.183
There's more possibility
with you here.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.786
There's just so many things
I don't have to explain to you.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.122
That's why I used to work alone.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.957
That isn't why.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.258
I'm sorry?

11:00.260 --> 11:02.162
I know you keep
some things from me.

11:02.195 --> 11:05.165
It's okay. I don't want
to talk about the past.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.334
I like the present better.

11:08.368 --> 11:11.338
Well...

11:11.371 --> 11:13.473
what do you know?

11:13.506 --> 11:16.009
That you'll kiss me back.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.764
There's Katie and
her mom Gabby.

11:36.797 --> 11:37.998
I'm sure Brian's around.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.900
VEGA:
Does she know about you two?

11:39.933 --> 11:42.169
I don't think so.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.872
And I'd prefer
she never did.

11:51.311 --> 11:55.015
Okay. You and I
go talk to the mom.

11:55.048 --> 11:58.018
You chat her up
while I use this.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.853
What is that?
Tox screen.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.022
See if she has any poison
in her system already.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.257
Only need a sample. Let's go.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.496
(clucking)

12:09.529 --> 12:11.464
(coughing)

12:15.368 --> 12:16.336
DASH:
There she is,

12:16.369 --> 12:18.071
Katie Stanton.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.306
Katie, cover your mouth, please.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.475
Gabby Stanton?

12:24.211 --> 12:26.113
Dash.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.149
Some people called me Slash.

12:29.182 --> 12:32.119
Oh, right. Right.
Haven't seen you in a while.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.287
I moved to the city.

12:34.321 --> 12:38.025
You sure don't get produce
like this where I live now.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.893
Why is it so small?

12:39.927 --> 12:41.895
I mean, corn should be, like...

12:41.929 --> 12:44.397
It's natural. We also
make our own soups.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.199
Chowders, split pea.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.568
Try some?

12:48.601 --> 12:50.303
No, thanks.
Mm. No, that's okay.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.505
You're from the city.
Thinking of moving

12:52.539 --> 12:53.907
to the island though.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.275
If you're looking for
a place to rent,

12:55.308 --> 12:56.576
we have guest quarters
at the farm.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.246
Oh. I'd love to check that out.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.248
And who is this?

13:01.281 --> 13:04.117
And what's she eating
to get so pretty?

13:04.151 --> 13:05.886
Katie.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.087
(coughs)

13:07.120 --> 13:09.389
Honey, I said
cover your mouth.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.024
Is Katie sick?

13:11.058 --> 13:13.060
People bring these things
in from the mainland. Here.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.328
Take the lozenge
Dr. Gage gave you.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.497
She's seeing a doctor?

13:17.530 --> 13:19.232
Herbalist.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.068
The kind of medicine
that doesn't rot our bodies

13:21.101 --> 13:22.202
from the inside out.

13:29.076 --> 13:31.111
You got a sec?

13:31.144 --> 13:32.579
Yeah.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.281
There's been a breach
in the system.
Our system?

13:34.314 --> 13:35.949
Mostly trolled
files but Sisi said

13:35.983 --> 13:38.351
they tried to hack into Hawk-Eye
but couldn't get in.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.419
We got to bring this upstairs.

13:39.452 --> 13:40.988
Before you do that,

13:41.021 --> 13:42.555
they've been poking around
for stuff.

13:42.589 --> 13:43.556
On you.

13:43.590 --> 13:44.557
Me?

13:44.591 --> 13:45.893
Yes. Case files,

13:45.926 --> 13:47.327
HR reports, anything

13:47.360 --> 13:49.529
with your name or badge.
I took the breach

13:49.562 --> 13:52.499
personally, so I back-hacked
by planting a beacon

13:52.532 --> 13:53.901
on the invader.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.202
Find anything?
No.

13:55.235 --> 13:56.904
The I.P. addresses
were hardcoded

13:56.904 --> 13:59.406
in the malware that originated
from Kuala Lumpur.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.174
Do you have any enemies there?

14:01.208 --> 14:02.642
Everywhere but.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.278
You saw D.I.A. around
the other day?

14:05.312 --> 14:07.547
They're vetting me.
A D.I.A job?

14:07.580 --> 14:11.018
I could have just sent them
the files upon request.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.386
Akeela, that's how you vet.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.123
You dig into people's private
lives without them knowing,

14:16.156 --> 14:18.291
and that's where the gold is.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.360
I was born to work there.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.662
We got to get out
in front of it.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.465
We?
Yeah. Shake some trees.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.000
Maybe there's something
I don't know about.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.202
See what you can find.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.584
I understand why
you kept Brian a secret.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.419
'Cause you kept
telling Dash and I

14:46.453 --> 14:49.522
not to get involved with people.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.525
You were a hypocrite.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.261
Yes.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.631
What I want to know is
why it ended.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.533
Was it you or him?

15:00.567 --> 15:02.335
That's personal.

15:02.369 --> 15:05.072
Come on, I tell you everything
about my girlfriends.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.673
I know. I wish you wouldn't.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.581
I'm going to talk to him.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.083
Wait.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.590
Good to go.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.300
Hi.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.538
Agatha.
Hello, Brian.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.375
Katie's getting big.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.644
Yeah, they grow up fast.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.713
How is she?

15:46.746 --> 15:51.484
Gabby has her up to ninth-grade
quantum physics, string theory.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.353
Wow.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.122
And how's her health?

15:58.025 --> 16:00.327
Gabby's watching
everything she eats.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.565
What's this about?

16:05.598 --> 16:07.567
Nothing. I...

16:07.600 --> 16:10.403
Just... you've been on my mind.

16:13.606 --> 16:16.109
Should probably get
back to my family.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.786
Everything okay?
Yeah.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.155
Did you learn
anything?

16:28.188 --> 16:29.556
The mother's protective.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.591
And Katie's cough
seems like more than a cold.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.426
ARTHUR
What about the tox-screen?

16:33.460 --> 16:36.129
No poison detected.
So we're exactly nowhere.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.631
Unless she really does die
of an illness.
If she's sick,

16:38.665 --> 16:40.633
how is that a murder?
Why would Agatha see that?

16:40.667 --> 16:42.235
Maybe they know
she's sick,

16:42.269 --> 16:44.204
but they won't give her
the help that she needs.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.605
What about that doctor?

16:45.638 --> 16:48.075
She said there was
a doctor on the island.

16:48.075 --> 16:50.510
Yes. Sort of.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.080
Why don't you
pay him a visit?

17:02.355 --> 17:04.091
Dr. Gage?

17:04.124 --> 17:05.825
I used to see you a lot
when you first moved here.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.327
You were
a real hypochondriac.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.728
I didn't have a lot of friends.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.297
You take 'em
where you can get 'em.

17:10.330 --> 17:13.133
Why are you still living
in the city, Dash?

17:13.166 --> 17:14.367
Oh, I kind of like it.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.669
Hmm? Mm.

17:16.703 --> 17:17.804
I mean, I got to

17:17.837 --> 17:19.439
give you the stats on illness

17:19.472 --> 17:21.108
in metropolitan areas.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.343
Humans weren't designed
to live that way.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.777
Nearly killed me.

17:24.811 --> 17:27.747
I was 260 pounds.
Then I moved here.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.582
So, what is it with you?

17:29.616 --> 17:31.851
Lungs? Indigestion?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.686
Actually, I'm here
about a friend.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.489
You know that lying
causes stress, right?

17:36.523 --> 17:38.125
Which kills.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.459
Wh-What's been the single
biggest health event

17:39.492 --> 17:40.827
of the 21st century?

17:40.860 --> 17:42.462
I'm not lying.
2031.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.131
Every person on the planet

17:44.164 --> 17:46.699
had their entire
digital footprint made public.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.535
E-mails, search histories.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.670
Best beach reading ever.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.705
It was before my time.
The stress levels...

17:52.739 --> 17:54.207
(whooshes)
...went through the roof.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.775
Divorce, alcoholism.

17:55.808 --> 17:59.146
15 million deaths were
attributed to that one hack.

17:59.146 --> 18:01.214
Okay, I'm telling you,
it is madness

18:01.248 --> 18:04.584
to have those damn things
in a home. Hmm.

18:04.617 --> 18:08.155
Um, I wanted to ask you
about Katie Stanton.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.424
I heard she was sick.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.660
Her father was a good friend
of my sister's.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.795
Yeah.

18:15.828 --> 18:19.166
Brian came to see me, disturbed.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.800
Nearly a panic.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.602
Poor girl came down
with malaria.

18:22.635 --> 18:25.472
And you can thank the flooding
of the Chesapeake for that.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.574
Malaria? But there's
a vaccine for that.

18:27.607 --> 18:31.344
A vaccine? The city air
is going to your brain.

18:31.378 --> 18:34.447
The-the malaria vaccine did
this world more harm than good.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.649
You won't give her any medicine?

18:36.683 --> 18:39.519
Now you sound like Brian.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.854
Luckily, the girl's mother
has more sense.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.824
She and I are working
on a holistic cure.

18:44.857 --> 18:47.260
You know, we're gonna wipe
this whole infection away...

18:47.294 --> 18:48.895
(whooshes)
...in no time.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.301
Katie just needs
malaria medicine,

18:54.334 --> 18:55.468
but her doctor and parents...

18:55.502 --> 18:57.637
Mostly her mother.
...are stopping her
from getting it.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.240
Would you feel
that as a murder?
It's possible.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.874
Well, first things first--
we need to get the girl

19:01.908 --> 19:04.244
her medicine.
Melindan.
Gates Foundation. 2022.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.213
I have a head
for history.

19:06.213 --> 19:08.248
The question is:
how do we get it?

19:08.281 --> 19:10.317
The next ferry isn't
till tomorrow morning.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.885
Leave it to me.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.887
You think this will be
the first time I snuck

19:14.921 --> 19:16.356
contraband onto the island?

19:16.389 --> 19:18.691
You'll have it
before sunset.

19:18.725 --> 19:21.228
The hard part is
convincing crazy mom to
give it to her daughter.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.429
That's where you come in.
No.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.231
You. You two get the
medicine, and by the time

19:24.264 --> 19:25.798
you've done that, hopefully
we've convinced Gabby,

19:25.832 --> 19:28.535
and you can meet us at her
house. You're coming with me.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.772
(car door closes)

19:34.941 --> 19:37.410
You girls have fun.

19:37.444 --> 19:39.479
Use your words.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.782
Let's go.

19:48.321 --> 19:51.591
You want me to
find dirt on a cop?

19:51.624 --> 19:54.461
I have Blake's permission,
but I can't risk having it being

19:54.494 --> 19:56.396
traced back to me from Metro,
so I need to outsource it.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.465
What's in it for me,
besides jail time?

19:58.498 --> 19:59.866
You're a rebel.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.601
You live for this.

20:01.634 --> 20:04.271
It's not like
you're in this for the money.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.538
Obviously.

20:08.775 --> 20:12.779
Unless, of course,
you don't think you're up to it.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.815
Uh...

20:18.751 --> 20:21.254
DASH:
You ever wish we still

20:21.288 --> 20:22.622
lived here?

20:22.655 --> 20:24.891
Never ever.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.993
You do?

20:27.026 --> 20:30.263
You got to admit,
it's peaceful.

20:30.297 --> 20:31.531
Sure.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.966
Only children
get murdered.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.470
If you love it so much,
why don't you move back?

20:37.504 --> 20:39.238
I've thought about it.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.844
Let me ask you a question.

20:44.877 --> 20:47.280
If you could lose our gift,

20:47.314 --> 20:50.717
or curse, or power,
whatever you want to call it,

20:50.750 --> 20:51.818
would you?

20:53.019 --> 20:55.955
I'll go with "curse,"
and yes.

20:55.988 --> 20:59.559
Powerful people want to put us
back in a milk bath prison.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.028
Maybe our government,
maybe another.

21:02.061 --> 21:04.531
We're always gonna be hunted.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.766
I'd prefer that wasn't the case.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.770
You?
I'd keep it.

21:10.803 --> 21:14.474
Why? Seeing people get
slaughtered and not make a dime?

21:14.507 --> 21:16.876
Yeah, that part's tough.

21:16.909 --> 21:19.779
But I have a chance
to save them.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.681
Not many people do.

21:21.714 --> 21:25.051
FETTS:
Hey, guys, what's going on?

21:25.084 --> 21:27.354
Fettsy.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.456
Sorry, we're, uh...
we're fishing this spot.

21:29.489 --> 21:30.857
Oh, yeah?

21:30.890 --> 21:33.693
Where's your poles?

21:33.726 --> 21:35.728
You're talking
about that stork coming in.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.731
MAN:
Weird-looking thing.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.600
MAN 2:
Wonder if it's good eatin'.

21:40.633 --> 21:41.734
One way to find out.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.107
Why'd you do that, Fetts?

21:48.140 --> 21:50.076
You arrived with
a D.C. cop, Arthur.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.644
Just doesn't add up.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.112
Why are you afraid of the cops?

21:53.145 --> 21:54.981
Aren't you the law
around here?

21:55.014 --> 21:58.084
If you're the law, it's easier
to break the law, right?

21:58.117 --> 22:00.687
Well, somebody had to
pick up where you left off.

22:00.720 --> 22:03.823
Fetts, don't worry about
that D.C. cop.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.091
She's on my payroll.

22:05.124 --> 22:06.426
I guarantee you,

22:06.459 --> 22:07.794
she won't be a problem.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.028
Let me just get my stuff,
and I'll...

22:09.061 --> 22:10.897
Stop.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.400
Titanium. I need the body open
to check it out.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.403
What are we doing?
Opening up your drone,

22:16.403 --> 22:18.971
making sure there's no
cameras, infrareds.
Come on.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.474
Shut up. You've always been real
good at taking care of yourself.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.075
Just making sure that
you're not selling me out.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.512
And you're staying with
me until I am. Let's go.

22:45.765 --> 22:48.468
Did you see that house
back there? The red one?

22:48.501 --> 22:50.069
Yes, it's cute.

22:50.102 --> 22:52.672
It's in a great spot,
but I'd open it up a bit,

22:52.705 --> 22:54.607
knock down a few walls
in the front,

22:54.641 --> 22:56.042
give it some space.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.944
You'd need more space?

22:57.977 --> 22:59.579
We might.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.147
Haven't you
thought about it?

23:01.180 --> 23:03.650
A family?

23:07.620 --> 23:10.490
I'm sorry.

23:10.523 --> 23:11.991
I pushed.

23:12.024 --> 23:13.693
You once said

23:13.726 --> 23:15.762
you knew I had a secret.

23:15.795 --> 23:17.897
You know what it is?

23:17.930 --> 23:19.899
I never asked.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.469
Prison.

23:24.637 --> 23:27.840
I spent six years in
one for grand theft.

23:27.874 --> 23:30.209
And when I got out,

23:30.242 --> 23:33.880
I came here and spent
my days thinking about

23:33.913 --> 23:35.982
how I could have done
things differently.

23:36.015 --> 23:39.852
But since I met you...

23:39.886 --> 23:43.656
I've been thinking
about what can be.

23:43.690 --> 23:46.759
I see us living in
that little red house.

23:46.793 --> 23:49.796
You painting the
walls in the nursery

23:49.829 --> 23:53.065
when the baby comes.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.134
Maybe a daughter.

23:55.167 --> 23:57.837
We'll name her
Katherine, Katie.

23:57.870 --> 24:02.074
She plays out there in the
fields with all the horses.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.110
Can you see?

24:06.513 --> 24:07.780
No.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.584
(chuckles)

24:11.618 --> 24:12.852
Maybe it's too soon.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.521
No, I can't see that at all.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.661
What is it that
you're afraid of?

24:21.694 --> 24:22.829
You don't understand.

24:22.862 --> 24:24.263
There are things...

24:24.296 --> 24:26.232
Tell me. Please.
I can't.

24:29.636 --> 24:30.803
I'll only get you hurt.

24:30.837 --> 24:32.739
Anybody close to me.

24:32.772 --> 24:35.174
This was a mistake.
No, it's okay.

24:35.207 --> 24:37.009
Agatha, let's just talk
about this tomorrow.

24:39.045 --> 24:40.647
I won't see you tomorrow.

24:40.680 --> 24:43.750
You'll wake up,

24:43.783 --> 24:45.685
and you'll go to the barn.

24:45.718 --> 24:48.855
You'll touch Mercury
on the nose,

24:48.888 --> 24:51.558
and you'll tell her
that I'm gone.

24:53.560 --> 24:57.196
In time, she'll forget.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.098
And so will you.

25:00.567 --> 25:02.234
(crying):
We all forget.

25:02.268 --> 25:05.572
What are you
talking about?

25:05.572 --> 25:06.739
Agatha.

25:07.907 --> 25:10.209
Good-bye, Brian.

25:10.242 --> 25:13.012
Agatha!

25:19.952 --> 25:21.688
So when are we gonna
talk about it?

25:21.721 --> 25:23.590
About what?
Your vision.

25:23.590 --> 25:25.692
The one
that has you so upset.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.627
Maybe it's a misunderstanding.

25:27.660 --> 25:30.096
That's not
how these things work.
So how do they?

25:31.230 --> 25:33.966
I don't get many
visions anymore.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.168
Not this far away.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.337
The night Dash left
for the city,

25:38.370 --> 25:40.973
I saw one, and it was
the three of us--

25:41.007 --> 25:43.142
Dash, Arthur and me.

25:43.175 --> 25:46.245
Hooked into their system.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.314
And now I've seen
you there, too.

25:48.347 --> 25:50.049
Doing what?
Standing above us.

25:50.082 --> 25:51.951
Staring.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.653
Like we're held captive.

25:53.686 --> 25:56.623
I thought
you didn't see your own futures.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.859
Maybe I'm trying to help you.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.227
Maybe.
Or maybe we can

26:01.260 --> 26:02.795
change that future.

26:02.829 --> 26:04.196
That's what Dash and I do.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.734
I promise,

26:07.767 --> 26:10.637
I won't let you or Dash
or Arthur get hooked up

26:10.670 --> 26:12.071
in the milk bath again.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.773
And I will feather my bed

26:13.806 --> 26:15.875
with all of your
good intentions, Detective.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.276
They don't matter.

26:17.309 --> 26:19.045
You only appeared
in my vision

26:19.078 --> 26:21.648
after you met Dash.

26:23.349 --> 26:25.885
The events are already
set in motion.

26:28.087 --> 26:31.057
Good. Let's go. Let's go.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.092
(coughing)

26:40.432 --> 26:42.802
Let's go.

26:42.835 --> 26:45.004
KATIE:
Come on. Come on.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.338
Should I go alone?

26:46.372 --> 26:47.974
No.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.842
I want to be here.

26:53.179 --> 26:55.181
(Katie coughing)

26:58.084 --> 27:00.720
Hi. Katie?

27:00.753 --> 27:01.353
Right?

27:01.387 --> 27:03.089
Yeah.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.924
I'm, uh, Lara,
from the market.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.259
Um... what's your name?

27:07.293 --> 27:09.261
I used to work here.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.897
I'm Agatha.

27:10.930 --> 27:11.898
Is Mercury to pasture?

27:11.931 --> 27:15.134
We lost her last winter.

27:15.167 --> 27:16.703
Sorry to hear that.

27:16.703 --> 27:18.137
GABBY:
Katie?

27:21.173 --> 27:23.009
Hello again.

27:26.278 --> 27:28.114
Can I help you ladies?
Hi.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.216
I was, uh, hoping
I could check out

27:30.249 --> 27:32.351
those guest quarters
you have for rent.

27:34.086 --> 27:35.121
Uh, this is

27:35.154 --> 27:36.355
my friend.

27:36.388 --> 27:37.790
She used to spend time here.

27:39.091 --> 27:41.961
Work. I worked here.

27:41.994 --> 27:44.831
Katie, will you check
on the soup, please?

27:44.864 --> 27:46.332
Yeah.

27:49.936 --> 27:52.371
You're her.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.440
You are the one
he never talked about.

27:55.975 --> 27:57.243
What do you want?

28:17.864 --> 28:19.899
What's going on?

28:22.234 --> 28:23.803
I came to see
the rental.

28:23.836 --> 28:25.004
Sure.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.372
I'll show you.

28:26.405 --> 28:27.506
I can do it.
No, you two

28:27.539 --> 28:28.975
need a chance to catch up.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.388
Why now, Agatha?

28:42.421 --> 28:44.791
Why would you come here now?

28:44.791 --> 28:46.358
Dash's friend needs a place
to stay and you guys have...

28:46.392 --> 28:47.359
Last I checked,

28:47.393 --> 28:49.295
there are 23 places in town.

28:49.328 --> 28:51.297
We offer the fewest amenities.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.532
Yet you drag your friend here.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.334
Why?

28:55.367 --> 28:57.336
The stars are brighter
out here.

28:57.369 --> 28:59.972
(sighs)
Stop.

29:00.006 --> 29:01.808
I'm worried about you.

29:01.841 --> 29:03.142
About Katie.

29:03.175 --> 29:04.811
What?

29:06.012 --> 29:07.880
What are you doing?

29:13.319 --> 29:14.954
You're lying.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.555
What are you talking about?

29:16.588 --> 29:18.324
Hey. Where are you going?

29:18.357 --> 29:20.392
Agatha! Get
out of there!

29:26.065 --> 29:27.934
Why are you
doing this?

29:27.967 --> 29:29.035
The medicine.

29:29.068 --> 29:30.236
You hide it from your wife.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.271
Hey, you give
that back.

29:32.304 --> 29:34.006
You're giving it to her.
Gabby doesn't want to treat her

29:34.040 --> 29:35.374
'cause she doesn't believe
in medicine,

29:35.407 --> 29:37.309
but you're giving it
to her anyway.

29:37.343 --> 29:38.845
How...?

29:38.878 --> 29:40.312
Look, stop.

29:40.346 --> 29:42.514
I don't understand how
you do what you do...

29:44.516 --> 29:46.185
...but please
don't tell Gabby.

29:46.218 --> 29:47.854
I won't.

29:47.887 --> 29:51.157
I knew you wouldn't...
y-you couldn't hurt her.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.392
Now, Agatha, tell me
what's going on.

29:55.862 --> 29:57.096
Now I don't know.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.203
AKEELA: Why do you live alone
like this anyway?

30:04.236 --> 30:06.605
You're worth hundreds
of millions.

30:06.638 --> 30:09.041
I am a one-percenter--
I give away 99%.

30:09.075 --> 30:10.877
Look it up
if you don't believe me.

30:10.910 --> 30:12.178
I did.

30:12.211 --> 30:14.947
I also know
that you're from Albany,

30:14.981 --> 30:16.949
you are the son
of a genius architect,

30:16.983 --> 30:20.586
your mother
was a microbiologist.

30:20.619 --> 30:23.122
You like calico cats
and cashmere socks.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.524
And... you were once married
for two years

30:25.557 --> 30:29.328
to an ex-nun named Diana.

30:29.361 --> 30:31.563
(chuckles)

30:31.597 --> 30:35.401
You think stalking
social media is a skill set?

30:35.434 --> 30:37.536
You have seven stocks

30:37.569 --> 30:39.638
and seven bonds
your grandfather gave you

30:39.671 --> 30:43.275
worth $958,000
as of 2:00 today.

30:43.309 --> 30:44.911
You still have a six-year-old
voice mail saved

30:44.944 --> 30:46.178
from a boyfriend
in Morristown

30:46.212 --> 30:47.613
describing what
he would do to you

30:47.646 --> 30:49.949
with his fingers and toes,
and I can't believe

30:49.982 --> 30:53.119
a systems operator
for a police department

30:53.152 --> 30:55.587
uses passwords
from Beatles' songs.

30:55.621 --> 30:57.890
(laughing)

30:59.091 --> 31:01.493
I'm good, Akeela.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.930
You're a high school freshman.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.335
Ow!

31:09.368 --> 31:10.970
Seriously?

31:11.003 --> 31:12.171
That was a violation.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.505
I was violated.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.407
Said the pot
to the...

31:15.441 --> 31:16.976
(computer chirps)

31:19.011 --> 31:21.580
Whoa.
What is it?

31:21.613 --> 31:23.282
There's a D.I.A
investigation into Blake.

31:23.315 --> 31:24.616
Dogs fully unleashed.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.318
What did he do?

31:26.352 --> 31:27.954
He didn't do anything.

31:27.954 --> 31:30.556
They're looking into
his Hawk-Eye program.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.524
They want to know
how his cops

31:32.558 --> 31:34.961
are getting such
great arrest numbers.

31:34.994 --> 31:36.395
Well, that's easy.

31:36.428 --> 31:40.099
Detective Lara Vega is secretly
working with a Precog.

31:41.733 --> 31:44.270
If they keep looking,

31:44.303 --> 31:46.338
it won't stay
secret long.

31:48.507 --> 31:51.477
Looks like you're
in a hurry.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.679
You sure you're ready to move
to a place like this?

31:53.712 --> 31:56.215
It's exactly why I need to
move to a place like this.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.584
The inside is lovely,
simple.

32:00.719 --> 32:03.255
But it has everything you need.

32:11.730 --> 32:13.499
What happened here?

32:13.532 --> 32:17.069
Nothing.
A... a bird flew into it.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.207
So, a .44 caliber bird

32:21.240 --> 32:22.408
flew in?

32:24.076 --> 32:27.013
Gabby, who shot into this house?

32:27.013 --> 32:30.149
You're not looking
for a place to rent.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.184
I'm a police officer.

32:32.218 --> 32:35.554
And I have reason to believe
that your family is in danger.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.158
(grunts)

32:39.191 --> 32:41.260
Let's go. Move it.

32:47.533 --> 32:50.536
No surveillance,
just this.

32:50.569 --> 32:53.172
Malaria medication
for a local kid.

32:53.205 --> 32:54.306
Medicine.

32:55.274 --> 32:58.444
Wow. You've changed, too.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.379
Tobacco?
ARTHUR: Cash crop.

33:00.412 --> 33:02.514
Ever since that amendment
passed making it illegal.

33:02.548 --> 33:05.284
Never saw you
as a farmer, Fetts.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.053
I deal mainly in
distribution, security.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.254
We outsource the growing.

33:08.287 --> 33:09.555
Who?
Local famers.

33:09.588 --> 33:12.724
Vogel. DiMeesas.
Nunis brothers.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.326
You know, some like
to make a buck,

33:14.360 --> 33:17.196
others are, well,
less enthusiastic,

33:17.229 --> 33:19.531
but where there's a will
there is a way.

33:19.565 --> 33:21.233
What about Brian Stanton?

33:21.267 --> 33:22.368
Tougher nut to crack.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.570
His wife would not want tobacco
growing on their land.

33:24.603 --> 33:25.704
We're negotiating.

33:25.737 --> 33:27.306
Is that what these are for?

33:27.339 --> 33:30.342
Or is there really that
big a pest problem

33:30.376 --> 33:32.144
drying tobacco?

33:32.178 --> 33:34.313
That's not the pest
were dealing with.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.348
Kenny! Outside.

33:39.285 --> 33:40.319
Lock 'em up.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.088
Join him in there, Arthur.

33:44.623 --> 33:47.159
You boys sit tight until we
figure out what to do with you.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.397
They're gonna poison
the Stanton family.

33:51.430 --> 33:52.498
That's how Katie dies.

33:52.531 --> 33:54.366
(door closes)

33:54.400 --> 33:56.735
You know what I'd like
to have right now?

33:56.768 --> 33:58.204
Phone service?

34:02.408 --> 34:03.742
You meditating now?

34:03.775 --> 34:06.145
Two, six, one, five.

34:06.178 --> 34:08.480
Please tell me that's
the combination.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.387
Kenny, you run your damn mouth
too much.

34:15.421 --> 34:17.556
Now they're asking
about the Stantons.

34:17.589 --> 34:18.857
You see,
that could be a problem.

34:18.890 --> 34:21.793
If they figure out
what we're trying to do here...

34:22.494 --> 34:24.130
Hey!
Hey, come back here!

34:24.163 --> 34:25.464
Son of a bitch!

34:25.497 --> 34:27.533
Get in the damn truck!

34:27.566 --> 34:30.236
BRIAN:
Yeah, I've been beefing

34:30.269 --> 34:32.404
with some thugs who want
to grow tobacco on my land.

34:32.438 --> 34:34.406
But why do you think Katie
could somehow be in danger?

34:34.440 --> 34:35.874
You just have
to trust her, Brian.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.176
She wants to help.

34:37.209 --> 34:38.744
(whip-poor-will calling)

34:38.777 --> 34:41.347
Is that...?

34:41.380 --> 34:42.748
A whip-poor-will.

34:42.781 --> 34:45.151
GABBY (outside):
Brian! Brian!

34:46.685 --> 34:48.587
VEGA:
What happened?

34:48.620 --> 34:50.422
He was fine. He was...

34:50.456 --> 34:51.557
VEGA:
Poisoned.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.359
The water.

34:53.392 --> 34:55.227
That must be how
she gets sick.

34:55.261 --> 34:57.163
BRIAN:
How who gets sick?

34:58.164 --> 35:00.332
Katie, no!
Katie!

35:00.366 --> 35:01.367
Stop!

35:01.400 --> 35:02.434
Katie, stop!

35:05.437 --> 35:07.406
No!

35:10.242 --> 35:12.344
KATIE:
What? I was thirsty.

35:12.378 --> 35:13.312
It's the water.

35:13.345 --> 35:14.846
At least we stopped it.

35:14.880 --> 35:15.914
We're not done.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.416
Fetts and his guys,

35:17.449 --> 35:18.717
they're coming.

35:26.658 --> 35:30.196
ARTHUR: Five men, three
shotguns, two have Glocks.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.399
36 rounds

35:33.432 --> 35:34.800
of total ammunition.

35:34.833 --> 35:36.368
DASH:
Okay, we have

35:36.402 --> 35:38.437
a sonic pistol and a spatula.

35:39.805 --> 35:42.608
Brian...

35:42.641 --> 35:43.809
given how friendly
your neighbors are,

35:43.842 --> 35:45.244
you must own a firearm.

35:45.277 --> 35:47.213
Given his
criminal record,

35:47.213 --> 35:48.680
I thought it best
he didn't.

35:48.714 --> 35:50.282
We are not without skills,
Detective.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.885
Take Gabby and Katie
to the guest quarters,

35:53.919 --> 35:55.587
and stay quiet.

35:55.621 --> 35:56.522
I'll get Katie.

36:00.759 --> 36:03.462
Once they're safe,
I'll come back to help.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.497
No.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.267
I did see it.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.735
Our future.

36:11.470 --> 36:14.273
Had its moments--
they were nice.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.876
But I also saw them,

36:17.909 --> 36:20.512
and I saw how happy
you would be with them

36:20.546 --> 36:22.514
for the rest of your life.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.452
You need to protect that.

36:30.522 --> 36:31.757
VEGA:
Agatha.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.792
They're coming.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.399
(men whooping, shouting)

36:43.802 --> 36:45.804
(shouting continues)

36:56.615 --> 36:58.617
I got to go back.

37:04.523 --> 37:06.692
(shotgun clicks)
Where you going?

37:06.725 --> 37:08.560
Easy.

37:08.594 --> 37:10.529
Back up.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.931
Don't want any
nasty accidents.

37:18.704 --> 37:21.039
Hey, Fetts,
I got the farmers.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.541
FETTS:
Make it look like an accident.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.009
We'll get the others.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.885
*

37:58.043 --> 37:59.711
(door creaks)

38:00.979 --> 38:03.749
(floorboards creaking)

38:22.634 --> 38:25.036
(floorboard creaking)

38:25.070 --> 38:27.373
(whispering): Seven footsteps.
What?

38:27.373 --> 38:28.807
I'll tell you when.

38:30.409 --> 38:31.743
(creaking)

38:51.430 --> 38:52.898
(grunts)

38:59.938 --> 39:01.473
(gun clicks)

39:01.507 --> 39:02.641
You three should've

39:02.674 --> 39:03.809
stayed home today.

39:09.615 --> 39:10.949
(chuckles)

39:10.982 --> 39:12.484
(Stantons knocking,
shouting frantically)

39:16.555 --> 39:17.823
Up against that wall.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.758
Stew!

39:19.791 --> 39:20.959
Make sure
they don't escape

39:20.992 --> 39:22.428
around the back.

39:22.428 --> 39:23.762
STEW:
All right, boss.

39:24.963 --> 39:26.698
FETTS:
You know, I am glad

39:26.732 --> 39:28.900
that y'all showed up though,
'cause I have always

39:28.934 --> 39:30.602
wanted one of these.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.104
All right.

39:34.473 --> 39:37.543
Let's finish this.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.745
See you on
the other side.

39:49.921 --> 39:52.858
VEGA:
Hands in the air!

39:54.926 --> 39:56.094
Nice move.

39:56.127 --> 39:58.063
Want to do the honors?
Sure.

40:01.032 --> 40:02.568
(grunting)

40:02.601 --> 40:05.937
Get up. Let's go.

40:09.641 --> 40:12.210
ARTHUR: You know what
I love about this place?

40:12.243 --> 40:13.579
No.

40:13.612 --> 40:16.448
Me neither.

40:16.482 --> 40:19.751
Hey, sis, how about
next year, my place

40:19.785 --> 40:20.952
for Thanksgiving?

40:20.986 --> 40:22.521
Thank you.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.737
Be careful.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.539
I'm more worried about you.

40:40.572 --> 40:42.474
Don't be.

40:55.654 --> 40:58.189
Well, I'm looking forward
to getting back home.

40:59.825 --> 41:03.161
And I'm looking forward
to seeing you again, Lara.

41:03.194 --> 41:05.597
And this time, we'll see
who's right about all this.
