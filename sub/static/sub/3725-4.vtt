better to abandon this position

07:35.287 --> 07:37.121

700?

33:01.228 --> 33:02.143
What about our men?

33:02.173 --> 33:04.502
Only 9 dead and 33 wounded, sir.

33:04.532 --> 33:05.823
(Rusk): 34...

33:05.866 --> 33:07.405
counting you.

33:07.435 --> 33:09.872
And Deaf is unaccounted for.

33:09.902 --> 33:11.187
(Houston): Deaf?

33:11.217 --> 33:13.565
Well, rally the Rangers.

33:14.007 --> 33:14.999
Find him.

33:15.029 --> 33:16.668
Yes, sir.

33:16.710 --> 33:18.432
(Houston): Has Santa Anna been captured?

33:18.736 --> 33:20.484
We are hunting him, sir.

33:20.514 --> 33:22.814
He must be taken alive. You hear me?

33:24.426 --> 33:26.844
Without him, there's no victory.

33:26.887 --> 33:29.472
We've won nothing.

33:29.515 --> 33:30.890
(Groans)

33:40.519 --> 33:43.315
(Lamar): Keep searching, men!

33:48.576 --> 33:50.352
(Man): Down here!

33:51.843 --> 33:53.996
Over here!

33:55.013 --> 33:57.125
This way!

34:18.897 --> 34:21.899
(Water rushing)

34:24.945 --> 34:28.820
(Rustling)

34:28.850 --> 34:30.266
Mexicano!

34:30.309 --> 34:31.976
Mexicano. Mexicano!

34:32.020 --> 34:33.478
Benito?

34:34.123 --> 34:35.396
Benito,

34:35.438 --> 34:38.315
you are one of the keepers
of my champion birds.

34:38.659 --> 34:39.543
Presidente?

34:39.572 --> 34:41.953
- Si.
- Presidente.

34:41.995 --> 34:46.706
My friends are all dead.

34:50.243 --> 34:52.685
We lost.

34:52.958 --> 34:56.025
We lost a lot of friends today.

35:01.907 --> 35:03.283
(Man): Put him down over there.

35:06.996 --> 35:08.621
I thought you'd be hanging curtains

35:08.664 --> 35:12.750
and darning your fiancé's socks by now.

35:12.793 --> 35:14.511
I'm not going anywhere yet.

35:14.541 --> 35:16.643
Drink this.

35:17.631 --> 35:18.923
(Man): I need to clean this.

35:18.966 --> 35:20.967
Get me some more water.

35:21.323 --> 35:22.951
Do you love him?

35:24.079 --> 35:25.329
Gavin's a goodhearted man.

35:25.372 --> 35:26.831
He's decent.

35:26.874 --> 35:29.166
Daddy loved him, promised
me to him years ago.

35:29.209 --> 35:32.086
Answer my damn question.

35:36.758 --> 35:38.050
(Groaning)

35:38.093 --> 35:39.677
(Man): Just get him some laudanum.

35:39.720 --> 35:42.021
(Panting)

35:42.051 --> 35:46.480
You don't want what I got to give, no way.

35:46.510 --> 35:48.382
The next bullet that comes
my way might be my last.

35:48.412 --> 35:50.242
Don't say such things.

35:50.272 --> 35:51.539
You know, my whole life,

35:51.582 --> 35:54.084
people have been telling
me what's good for me.

35:54.126 --> 35:56.962
(Man): Back over when you've got a minute.

35:57.753 --> 36:00.253
You'd be a damn fool not to go with him.

36:02.426 --> 36:05.178
No, you're the fool, Kit Acklin.

36:09.745 --> 36:12.085
(Crunching, man screaming)

36:12.115 --> 36:14.462
(Houston): Where am I?

36:14.905 --> 36:16.844
Did they cut my leg off?

36:16.874 --> 36:19.417
(Doc Ewing): No, but
your ankle was shattered.

36:19.459 --> 36:20.981
If sepsis sets in,

36:21.011 --> 36:24.305
you will die a slow, miserable death.

36:24.348 --> 36:25.640
Any word from Emily?

36:25.683 --> 36:26.606
(Doc Ewing): No.

36:26.636 --> 36:28.976
We got to get you to New Orleans.

36:29.019 --> 36:31.479
If not, should you fall unconscious,

36:31.522 --> 36:33.815
I will have that leg off.

36:33.857 --> 36:37.527
I'll take my chances in New Orleans.

36:40.039 --> 36:41.360
Emily.

36:41.390 --> 36:44.392
(Distant gunfire)

36:57.740 --> 37:00.784
(Coughing)

37:06.466 --> 37:09.334
(Indistinct shouting)

37:09.377 --> 37:11.378
(Shushing)

37:15.216 --> 37:18.510
(Distant shouting)

37:18.552 --> 37:21.596
(Distant cannonfire)

37:25.393 --> 37:28.353
(Whimpering)

37:35.190 --> 37:37.320
Am I dying, padre?

37:42.953 --> 37:43.952
Si.

37:54.215 --> 37:56.215
(Sobbing)

38:03.764 --> 38:05.140
(Karnes): Deaf.

38:06.067 --> 38:07.456
Deaf!

38:07.897 --> 38:10.061
(Flames crackling)

38:12.765 --> 38:15.680
(Distant banging)

38:29.534 --> 38:33.042
(Loud banging)

38:35.461 --> 38:37.255
(Knowles): Oh-ho!

38:38.674 --> 38:41.342
Well, chop my legs and call me Shorty.

38:41.385 --> 38:44.095
Vern! Vern, ain't this swank?

38:44.688 --> 38:45.876
Ain't this swank?

38:45.906 --> 38:46.998
Close this thing.

38:47.028 --> 38:48.396
Hey, take a look at this.

38:48.426 --> 38:49.592
Take a look at this.

38:49.635 --> 38:51.344
(Breathes noisily): One second.

38:51.946 --> 38:54.153
General Santa Annabella herself.

38:54.183 --> 38:56.199
Ooh, well, hello there.

38:56.229 --> 38:58.447
Hello. Hello, there.

38:58.477 --> 39:00.311
The spoils of war, son.

39:00.354 --> 39:01.842
We grab what we can hold,

39:01.872 --> 39:03.564
and we cut out of here tonight.

39:03.607 --> 39:05.066
Yes, sir. Whoa, whoa, no.

39:05.108 --> 39:06.359
I don't know.

39:06.401 --> 39:07.610
Vern, Vern, hey, Vern.

39:07.653 --> 39:09.491
You got to understand.

39:09.521 --> 39:11.147
I'm a hero now.

39:11.190 --> 39:14.288
I saved the war secretary's life.

39:14.694 --> 39:18.529
I heard you tripped
over a bunch of Mexicans.

39:18.572 --> 39:19.530
It...

39:19.573 --> 39:20.508
(Thudding and grunting)

39:20.538 --> 39:21.999
Ha!

39:26.080 --> 39:27.664
Eureka.

39:30.234 --> 39:32.193
Holy shit.

39:43.914 --> 39:45.206
(Gun cocks)

39:47.209 --> 39:48.710
(Colby Pitt): Surrender, Mexican,

39:48.752 --> 39:51.754
or I'll kill you deader than last Tuesday.

39:51.797 --> 39:55.550
On your knees. On your knees.

39:55.593 --> 39:57.927
Are you alone?

39:58.470 --> 39:59.887
Maybe.

40:05.703 --> 40:07.608
Hands up.

40:07.638 --> 40:09.097
Hands up!

40:18.106 --> 40:19.566
God damn. We can't get it all now.

40:19.608 --> 40:22.193
Got to come back before we head out.

40:22.236 --> 40:24.362
- (Metallic clattering)
- (Gasps)

40:24.755 --> 40:27.548
Well, goodness gracious.

40:27.591 --> 40:29.472
What is this?

40:30.844 --> 40:34.472
It's the mother lode...
Santa Anna's treasure.

40:34.515 --> 40:36.474
You snakes weren't gonna tell me about it?

40:36.517 --> 40:37.684
Well, why should we?

40:37.726 --> 40:39.548
We found it.

40:39.578 --> 40:42.163
Lucky for me,

40:42.193 --> 40:43.848
so did I.

40:43.891 --> 40:47.323
(Karnes): That there must
be El Presidente's tent.

40:48.050 --> 40:49.583
(Elwood): Cover this shit up. That's right.

40:49.613 --> 40:51.739
- All right.
- Cover it up.

40:51.782 --> 40:54.855
- All right.
- That's right.

41:00.290 --> 41:02.896
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-whee!

41:02.926 --> 41:05.303
Awful highfalutin.

41:05.345 --> 41:07.555
(Laughs)

41:07.598 --> 41:10.187
Looks like this place done been looted.

41:10.217 --> 41:13.052
We was just picking up
a few souvenirs, man.

41:13.095 --> 41:14.825
Spoils of war and such.

41:14.855 --> 41:17.277
Well, you know that looting

41:17.307 --> 41:21.611
could get you court-martialed and shot.

41:21.641 --> 41:24.897
- (Laughs nervously)
- What, you mean...

41:24.940 --> 41:29.861
even for a token or two
for our loyalty to Texas?

41:29.903 --> 41:31.785
Listen up.

41:31.815 --> 41:34.171
All this belongs to the Texas government.

41:34.441 --> 41:36.588
So if you don't mind, I'll take...

41:36.618 --> 41:39.537
- Captain, you all right?
- Son of a bitch.

41:40.736 --> 41:42.707
(Quietly): Damn.

41:42.750 --> 41:46.807
Oh, lookee here.

41:47.248 --> 41:49.303
Would you look at that?

41:49.333 --> 41:52.592
Santa Anna must've buried that, right?

41:52.634 --> 41:54.594
Must have.

41:54.636 --> 41:55.970
All of it.

42:01.656 --> 42:05.980
(Loud thud)

42:06.023 --> 42:08.900
(Metallic clinking and thud)

42:08.942 --> 42:10.902
(Quietly): Damn.

42:10.944 --> 42:13.738
(Indistinct chatter)

42:13.781 --> 42:16.783
(Scattered cheering)

42:25.834 --> 42:27.877
(Man): Yeah!

42:27.920 --> 42:30.922
(All cheering)

42:34.343 --> 42:35.593
How about that?

42:35.636 --> 42:38.721
(Man): Vive, El Presidente!

42:38.764 --> 42:40.681
(Man): Yeah!

42:40.724 --> 42:43.356
(Doc Ewing): It's a tincture of opium, Sam,

42:43.386 --> 42:46.103
for the pain.

42:46.146 --> 42:49.023
Quart of warm whiskey
would work just as well.

42:52.453 --> 42:55.413
General, you've got to see this.

42:55.456 --> 42:56.619
He needs to rest.

42:56.649 --> 42:58.149
I need fresh air.

42:58.192 --> 43:00.527
Fetch my clothes.

43:00.569 --> 43:03.279
Haul me up, Tom.

43:03.322 --> 43:06.324
(Hockley): By my count,
we have over 20,000 pieces

43:06.367 --> 43:07.825
of silver and gold...

43:07.868 --> 43:10.495
all of Santa Anna's
personal valuables, sir.

43:10.538 --> 43:13.206
(Seguin): General, we must give
these to the people of Tejas.

43:13.249 --> 43:15.500
(Rusk): Gentlemen, there is
no discussion on this matter.

43:15.543 --> 43:17.168
Funds seized from the enemy

43:17.211 --> 43:20.672
belong to the newly liberated Republic.

43:20.714 --> 43:22.173
(Man): Another group going in.

43:22.216 --> 43:24.676
(Rusk): It all goes to Texas.

43:28.722 --> 43:31.849
Karnes, that soldier there.

43:31.892 --> 43:33.101
Bring him to me.

43:33.143 --> 43:34.519
(Karnes): Sir.

43:34.562 --> 43:36.521
Flores, fetch Colonel Almonte.

43:36.564 --> 43:38.898
Yes, sir.

43:38.928 --> 43:40.191
(Man): Move!

43:40.234 --> 43:41.979
(Indistinct chatter)

43:42.009 --> 43:45.109
- (Flores): Colonel Almonte...
- (Karnes): Come on.

43:58.736 --> 44:00.695
So you're a private.

44:01.285 --> 44:04.537
Si, señor.

44:05.217 --> 44:07.598
Colonel Almonte,

44:07.628 --> 44:10.588
why do your men salute him?

44:10.631 --> 44:11.835
Regretfully,

44:11.865 --> 44:13.987
I do not know all my soldiers, sir.

44:14.017 --> 44:15.889
That's too bad.

44:15.919 --> 44:17.169
Private Pitt,

44:17.897 --> 44:20.151
execute your prisoner.

44:22.418 --> 44:23.835
(Colby Pitt): Yes, sir.

44:25.337 --> 44:27.505
(Houston): No, private.

44:28.673 --> 44:30.341
Put him up against a tree

44:30.384 --> 44:32.923
so his brains don't splatter.

44:36.122 --> 44:39.642
I am Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.

44:39.685 --> 44:40.651
Wait. He's Santa Anna?

44:40.681 --> 44:44.268
And I am Sam Houston.

44:44.298 --> 44:46.466
El Presidente, General,

44:46.736 --> 44:48.757
I cannot express

44:48.787 --> 44:52.555
how glad I am to meet you.

44:52.871 --> 44:54.604
I ask to be treated as a general should be

44:54.634 --> 44:57.168
when made a prisoner of war.

44:57.211 --> 44:58.461
Men!

44:58.504 --> 45:00.547
We captured Santa Anna!

45:00.929 --> 45:03.508
We must convene a tribunal and execute him.

45:03.551 --> 45:06.177
(Baker): Death by firing squad!

45:06.220 --> 45:09.180
(All): yeah!

45:09.223 --> 45:10.515
(All talking at once)

45:10.558 --> 45:12.058
Yeah!

45:12.101 --> 45:15.103
(All shouting)

45:16.905 --> 45:19.991
The conqueror of the Napoleon of the West

45:20.476 --> 45:23.870
can afford to be generous
to the vanquished, no?

45:23.912 --> 45:25.788
You should have remembered that, sir,

45:25.831 --> 45:27.498
at the Alamo.

45:27.541 --> 45:30.376
At the Alamo, your defenders chose to die.

45:30.419 --> 45:32.416
You offered them no alternative.

45:32.446 --> 45:34.568
- (Spits)
- Bastardo.

45:34.598 --> 45:36.307
Juan...

45:38.151 --> 45:39.819
This is war, sir,

45:39.861 --> 45:43.168
and no one here is good or bad,

45:43.693 --> 45:45.863
just winners

45:45.893 --> 45:49.473
and losers.

45:49.503 --> 45:51.898
I acted under the orders
from my government.

45:51.940 --> 45:54.191
You are yourself the government.

45:54.234 --> 45:55.776
That's damn right.

45:55.819 --> 45:58.029
(Rusk): Texas formed a
recognized government.

45:58.071 --> 45:59.697
We are not pirates.

45:59.740 --> 46:01.699
The rules of war applied.

46:01.742 --> 46:04.201
General, why are we even
talking to this murderer?

46:04.244 --> 46:05.849
He needs to swing.

46:05.879 --> 46:08.673
Firing squad, here and now!

46:08.716 --> 46:12.343
(All): Yeah!

46:12.386 --> 46:15.471
(All talking at once): Do it!

46:15.514 --> 46:16.973
- Yeah!
- (Men shouting)

46:30.994 --> 46:34.866
(Men shouting)

46:34.908 --> 46:37.156
(Houston): There'll be no firing squad.

46:37.186 --> 46:39.178
(Man): We want blood!

46:39.221 --> 46:41.868
(Houston): That cannot happen.

46:41.898 --> 46:45.309
Alive, Santa Anna is of great value to us.

46:45.502 --> 46:47.962
If we execute him,

46:48.005 --> 46:51.298
he'll just be another dead soldier.

46:51.612 --> 46:53.155
Let us take our reparations.

46:53.185 --> 46:55.194
Open his war chest.

46:55.237 --> 46:57.154
Gold to every man in my command.

46:57.197 --> 47:01.367
Equal shares for all those
who risked their lives.

47:01.409 --> 47:03.786
General Seguin, General Sherman,

47:03.829 --> 47:05.621
show the men.

47:05.664 --> 47:06.914
Divvy it up.

47:06.957 --> 47:09.834
(Sherman): Yes, sir.

47:09.876 --> 47:12.878
(All cheering)

47:33.150 --> 47:36.530
General, we're taking him.

47:36.560 --> 47:37.858
Retribution goes hand in hand

47:37.888 --> 47:39.346
with victory.

47:39.389 --> 47:41.182
Present your prisoner.

47:41.224 --> 47:43.517
I will not.

47:46.474 --> 47:48.355
All right, fine by me.

47:50.600 --> 47:52.977
We end it all now.

47:53.020 --> 47:55.980
My only reason for living

47:56.023 --> 47:57.940
is to slay him.

47:59.347 --> 48:01.736
Ride on out of here while you can.

48:01.778 --> 48:04.131
Shut your mouth, boy.

48:04.161 --> 48:05.856
Shoot me first.

48:06.575 --> 48:08.489
You don't think I will?

48:09.570 --> 48:12.599
Soldiers, ready arms!

48:36.664 --> 48:38.289
Don't fool yourself.

48:38.332 --> 48:41.471
Santa Anna will die!

48:41.501 --> 48:42.835
It's just a matter

48:42.878 --> 48:46.046
of how many of us he takes with him.

48:49.843 --> 48:52.136
You understand me?

49:55.617 --> 49:58.535
(Coughs)

50:11.425 --> 50:12.591
Charmaine.

50:12.634 --> 50:13.783
(Horse neighs)

50:13.813 --> 50:15.678
(Groans)

50:15.720 --> 50:17.876
Come here, girl.

50:17.906 --> 50:19.223
Come here.

50:19.266 --> 50:21.387
You saved me today.

50:33.672 --> 50:35.563
Oh, sweet girl.

50:37.724 --> 50:39.105
(Groans)

50:39.135 --> 50:42.976
(Horse whinnies)

50:44.111 --> 50:46.141
No.

50:50.288 --> 50:54.458
Why'd you have to go do that for?

50:54.501 --> 50:56.001
Why'd you do that?

51:18.024 --> 51:20.234
I'm so sorry.

51:22.537 --> 51:24.038
(Crying): I'm so sorry.

51:28.835 --> 51:31.337
Come on. Let's get you off that leg.

51:31.379 --> 51:33.547
Let's get you off that leg, okay?

51:50.236 --> 51:52.558
You do me a favor.

52:00.205 --> 52:02.743
You do me a favor.

52:02.786 --> 52:05.788
You wait for me. You hear?

52:05.831 --> 52:08.754
You wait for me.

52:08.784 --> 52:11.535
You'll be seeing me real soon.

52:13.622 --> 52:14.872
(Gun cocks)

52:14.915 --> 52:17.541
(Exhales)

52:17.584 --> 52:18.959
(Gunshot)

52:19.002 --> 52:20.669
(Gunshot echoing)

52:20.712 --> 52:23.380
(Crying)

52:35.268 --> 52:36.602
(Snickers)

52:36.645 --> 52:39.647
(Indistinct chatter in Spanish)

52:54.788 --> 52:57.039
(Distant galloping)

52:57.082 --> 52:58.290
(Man screaming)

52:58.333 --> 53:02.044
(All speaking Spanish)

53:02.087 --> 53:03.254
(Lorca): Get every one of them!

53:03.296 --> 53:04.588
Every one of them!

53:04.631 --> 53:05.798
Hey, come on!

53:05.841 --> 53:07.133
(Gunshot, woman screams)

53:07.175 --> 53:08.467
Come on!

53:08.510 --> 53:11.053
(People shouting indistinctly)

53:14.057 --> 53:15.516
(Panting)

53:15.559 --> 53:20.271
(Gunshot)

53:20.313 --> 53:23.315
(Laughter)

53:25.068 --> 53:26.402
(Gasps)

53:29.863 --> 53:31.365
No! He's just a child.

53:31.408 --> 53:32.783
Nits make lice.

53:32.826 --> 53:35.202
We're done killing women and children!

53:35.245 --> 53:36.787
Then get out of here!

53:36.830 --> 53:38.964
I aim to kill Mexicans,
and I ain't done yet.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.292
- Go.
- All right.

53:41.334 --> 53:43.168
Just go, man. Go.

53:43.710 --> 53:45.254
Go!

53:45.297 --> 53:46.839
Come on, man.

53:50.886 --> 53:54.138
Give me the boy.

54:00.854 --> 54:02.980
(Gunshot)

54:09.196 --> 54:10.584
(Thunder rumbles)

54:10.614 --> 54:12.073
(Houston): Any word from Deaf?

54:12.115 --> 54:13.449
(Flores): No, General.

54:13.892 --> 54:15.100
And Miss West?

54:15.143 --> 54:16.727
Nothing, sir.

54:19.335 --> 54:21.268
Very well.

54:26.279 --> 54:29.281
You wanted to keep me alive, no?

54:29.324 --> 54:32.409
Once you are gone, these men will hang me.

54:34.871 --> 54:36.121
Tell me something.

54:36.164 --> 54:39.306
Your generals... will they retreat

54:39.336 --> 54:42.177
once they're informed
you've been taken hostage?

54:42.220 --> 54:43.216
No.

54:43.696 --> 54:45.781
Their orders are to engage.

54:50.711 --> 54:53.755
Then I recommend you rescind those orders.

54:55.442 --> 54:58.610
So you want Texas

54:58.653 --> 55:01.572
in exchange for my life, huh?

55:01.614 --> 55:03.073
Sounds like a trade.

55:03.116 --> 55:04.283
(Rusk): Only President Burnett

55:04.325 --> 55:06.368
can negotiate a treaty.

55:06.411 --> 55:08.245
(Houston): Well, he
can't very well negotiate

55:08.288 --> 55:10.080
if El Presidente here is dead.

55:10.123 --> 55:11.582
Now, can he?

55:16.463 --> 55:18.088
(Woman): I'll need them vials.

55:18.131 --> 55:21.091
(Indistinct chatter)

55:25.130 --> 55:26.618
Kit,

55:26.648 --> 55:28.751
are you sure you're fit to ride?

55:28.781 --> 55:30.943
Hey, now, don't fuss.

55:30.985 --> 55:32.319
In case I need tending to,

55:32.362 --> 55:35.557
Doc Ewing's coming with the General.

55:36.574 --> 55:38.367
I'll see you when I get back.

55:38.409 --> 55:39.910
I certainly hope so...

55:39.953 --> 55:42.788
if you don't get yourself killed.

56:15.738 --> 56:19.871
(Elwood whistling)

56:26.499 --> 56:29.501
(Doc Ewing): Sarah, you got
my medical bag packed up yet?

56:32.088 --> 56:34.828
I'll be seeing you.

56:35.108 --> 56:37.234
(Doc Ewing): Sarah!

56:46.327 --> 56:48.203
Where you heading to, Vern?

56:50.628 --> 56:53.083
War is over for me, Knowles.

56:53.126 --> 56:54.293
I done my duty.

56:54.335 --> 56:56.587
Had my fill of taking orders.

56:56.855 --> 56:59.047
Might head on down to Victoria.

56:59.090 --> 57:00.879
Mm.

57:00.909 --> 57:02.493
You want to know my guess?

57:02.966 --> 57:06.413
You and Gator are going after that bank.

57:06.456 --> 57:09.500
Gator's so full of bunkum,
if he told me water was wet,

57:09.542 --> 57:12.503
I'd have to poke my finger
in and feel for myself.

57:13.947 --> 57:15.781
Kit didn't trust him.

57:16.123 --> 57:17.245
You ought not to neither.

57:17.275 --> 57:18.921
Well, I ain't robbing no bank.

57:18.951 --> 57:20.457
I'm a hero now.

57:20.487 --> 57:23.155
Got a reputation to uphold.

57:27.959 --> 57:31.705
Well, if you want to ride
your hero ass along with me,

57:31.748 --> 57:33.123
you're welcome.

57:34.709 --> 57:36.788
Well...

57:38.505 --> 57:40.631
no, thank you, my friend.

57:41.381 --> 57:44.259
I reckon I'll just stay put.

57:47.610 --> 57:49.797
Good luck with that shit.

57:52.905 --> 57:55.124
Tell them boys I say adios.

57:55.154 --> 57:57.071
All right.

58:02.081 --> 58:04.429
You lily-livered weasel.

58:04.472 --> 58:05.722
How in the hell am I supposed

58:05.765 --> 58:07.504
to take this bank by myself?

58:07.534 --> 58:11.036
Well, why don't you
recruit Karnes and Anderson?

58:23.032 --> 58:26.723
(Houston): Tom, I want you
to ride on ahead to Burnett.

58:26.753 --> 58:29.546
Formalize our agreement with Santa Anna.

58:29.589 --> 58:32.153
Buckley and Seguin will
take charge of the army

58:32.183 --> 58:33.340
while I'm away.

58:33.370 --> 58:35.268
(Rusk): You get that leg healed up, Sam.

58:35.311 --> 58:36.561
Texas needs you.

58:36.591 --> 58:37.562
(Grunts)

58:37.592 --> 58:41.444
You just gonna leave me behind, is that it?

58:41.501 --> 58:44.770
Well, I'll be damned.

58:44.800 --> 58:46.438
I'd about given up on you.

58:47.805 --> 58:50.534
I had to lay Charmaine to rest.

58:52.574 --> 58:54.113
(Karnes): Partner, damn.

58:54.155 --> 58:56.073
You look like something the cat dragged in

58:56.116 --> 58:58.594
that the goat wouldn't eat.

58:58.624 --> 58:59.878
Right here.

58:59.908 --> 59:00.744
(Coughs)

59:00.787 --> 59:03.080
Let it out.

59:03.351 --> 59:05.207
Let it on out.

59:08.161 --> 59:09.551
(Houston): Private Pitt.

59:10.984 --> 59:12.214
The man that captured Santa Anna

59:12.257 --> 59:14.680
ought to make a damn good Ranger.

59:14.710 --> 59:16.456
Your first assignment:

59:16.486 --> 59:18.762
Take Captain Smith home to his wife.

59:18.805 --> 59:20.417
Yes, sir.

59:20.447 --> 59:23.309
Sorry to hear about Charmaine.

59:23.351 --> 59:26.787
(Smith): Anybody fetch me a new mount yet?

59:26.817 --> 59:28.824
(Doc Ewing): Get a wagon
and lay him down in back.

59:28.993 --> 59:31.066
You're in no condition to go, Deaf.

59:35.525 --> 59:37.948
What'd you say, Sam?

59:38.209 --> 59:40.463
You need to look me in the eye.

59:44.331 --> 59:48.042
I said you're not going.

59:48.084 --> 59:50.919
And who's gonna look after
your old crippled ass?

59:52.783 --> 59:55.495
Karnes will take command of the Rangers.

59:56.843 --> 59:58.469
Just gonna throw me away.

59:58.511 --> 01:00:00.165
Is that it?

01:00:03.731 --> 01:00:06.310
Go home, old friend.

01:00:08.005 --> 01:00:11.361
The Republic of Texas
is grateful for your service.

01:00:11.391 --> 01:00:12.911
Go on.

01:00:12.941 --> 01:00:14.017
(Doc Ewing): All right.

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.354
Colby, get him in the medical tent.

01:00:17.702 --> 01:00:19.398
Got to get Houston to New Orleans

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:23.068
and Santa Anna to his peace talks.

01:00:23.111 --> 01:00:24.736
You take care of yourself, Deaf.

01:00:25.813 --> 01:00:27.489
(Houston): Let's move out.

01:00:27.532 --> 01:00:29.491
(Smith): Sam.

01:00:29.534 --> 01:00:30.867
Sam.

01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:33.453
I'll tell you when I'm done.

01:00:38.384 --> 01:00:39.801
Yah.

01:01:04.778 --> 01:01:06.995
(Groaning)

01:01:10.781 --> 01:01:13.544
(Fly buzzing)

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:37.317
(Doc Ewing): You just had one, Sam.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.526
That's quite enough.

01:01:38.569 --> 01:01:39.861
Mmm!

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.221
You think you are a man of destiny,

01:01:50.264 --> 01:01:52.140
but all I see

01:01:52.183 --> 01:01:54.184
is President Jackson's puppet.

01:01:56.228 --> 01:01:58.938
All I see is a man in a chicken coop.

01:01:59.081 --> 01:02:01.708
I am defending my people
against pirates like you,

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:04.081
stealing our land.

01:02:04.111 --> 01:02:07.906
History will sweep you
aside with a footnote.

01:02:07.948 --> 01:02:09.491
Perhaps.

01:02:09.533 --> 01:02:10.867
Better a footnote

01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:13.453
than a whole book of abominations.

01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:15.121
(Chuckles)

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:18.291
No difference with what
you did in San Jacinto.

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:20.335
We are men on opposite sides,

01:02:20.377 --> 01:02:22.796
yet there is much we share.

01:02:22.838 --> 01:02:25.340
A love of our countries,

01:02:25.382 --> 01:02:29.010
a love of... other things.

01:02:29.053 --> 01:02:31.429
A remarkable woman, Miss West.

01:02:32.608 --> 01:02:34.766
An extraordinary woman,

01:02:34.809 --> 01:02:37.056
especially in bed

01:02:37.086 --> 01:02:39.129
when she's screaming with pleasure.

01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:42.632
I hear women are quite skilled

01:02:42.675 --> 01:02:45.051
at pretending that sort of thing.

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:48.805
"Oh, Antonio, yes, yes, more.

01:02:48.848 --> 01:02:50.473
Give me more."

01:02:50.516 --> 01:02:53.184
Give him another one, Doc.

01:02:53.227 --> 01:02:56.271
He's wrestling with
what defeat tastes like.

01:03:11.446 --> 01:03:14.831
(Water splashing)

01:03:23.632 --> 01:03:26.468
Colonel Portilla's got Emily West.

01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:28.219
Wants to trade her for Santa Anna.

01:03:30.401 --> 01:03:32.223
A whore for a chief of state.

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:36.269
Portilla is losing his mind.

01:03:42.810 --> 01:03:44.602
Give this back to him.

01:03:46.366 --> 01:03:47.891
Flores.

01:03:49.758 --> 01:03:51.050
Sir?

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:54.053
(Speaking foreign language)

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:55.388
Yes, sir.

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:56.723
Anderson!

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.078
- Yeah.
- Get ready.

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:20.079
God is with us.

01:04:20.122 --> 01:04:21.310
Ha!

01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:22.716
Beads and whiskey

01:04:22.758 --> 01:04:24.342
always worked for me before.

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:30.765
Whoa, whoa. Keep your head, mister.

01:04:30.808 --> 01:04:33.143
Else you're liable to lose
it along with your scalp.

01:04:34.603 --> 01:04:36.396
Everything's set.

01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:39.107
I need my volunteers.

01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:40.442
(Woman): Get out there, Phineas.

01:04:40.484 --> 01:04:41.501
- You be a man.
- All right.

01:04:41.531 --> 01:04:44.149
I can give you Clarence
and the other Negroes.

01:04:44.179 --> 01:04:45.258
Best if I stay back

01:04:45.288 --> 01:04:48.685
and watch over the children and womenfolk.

I'm mighty proud of you.

01:21:14.377 --> 01:21:17.504
There ain't words for how much I love you.

01:21:33.479 --> 01:21:35.339
(Anderson): Make way!

01:21:50.079 --> 01:21:51.288
(Knock at door)

01:21:51.331 --> 01:21:52.915
(Man): Sam.

01:21:52.957 --> 01:21:55.792
Your enemies are conspiring
against you as we speak.

01:21:55.835 --> 01:22:00.547
(Burnet): He and Houston
want to annex our Texas.

01:22:02.634 --> 01:22:06.929
If you would accept this...

01:22:06.971 --> 01:22:09.014
It must be used for good.

01:22:09.057 --> 01:22:11.266
Your land is now forfiet
as well as the collateral...

01:22:11.309 --> 01:22:13.019
You can't have Nate.

01:22:14.646 --> 01:22:16.772
What about this one?

01:22:16.814 --> 01:22:19.149
Shoo, shoo, in the kitchen.

01:22:19.192 --> 01:22:22.861
Santa Anna's whore doesn't
eat with decent folk.

01:22:22.904 --> 01:22:25.781
I very much like your house.

01:22:25.823 --> 01:22:27.159
It would suit me.

01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:29.047
They may have cleaned you up.

01:22:29.077 --> 01:22:30.665
I know you.

01:22:30.695 --> 01:22:34.156
What do we got to do to join
up with a ranger company?

01:22:34.199 --> 01:22:37.826
(Gunshots)

01:22:37.869 --> 01:22:39.536
(Whooping)

01:22:39.579 --> 01:22:41.747
(Shouts)

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:44.145
And I suggest you finish
up your little party here

01:22:44.175 --> 01:22:45.634
and come with us and get back home

01:22:45.677 --> 01:22:47.565
and fix Texas before it's too late.
