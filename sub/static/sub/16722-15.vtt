00:40.912 --> 00:43.463
Anyone notice anything
different about me?

00:43.464 --> 00:44.798
- New boobs?
- New 'tude?

00:44.799 --> 00:47.083
Wrong and wronger.
I'm pregnant!

00:47.084 --> 00:48.735
Wha...?

00:48.736 --> 00:50.420
We're getting flour sack
babies in health class.

00:50.421 --> 00:51.721
You do have that glow.

00:51.722 --> 00:53.890
Aw, my little baby's having babies.

00:53.891 --> 00:55.008
I'm a sexy grandma.

00:55.009 --> 00:58.111
I can't believe they're going to
let you be in charge of a child.

00:58.112 --> 00:59.229
What are you talking about?

00:59.230 --> 01:00.897
I was born to be a mother.

01:00.898 --> 01:02.601
I'm gonna pull a flour
sack out of my bottom.

01:02.602 --> 01:03.967
Morning, everyone.

01:05.503 --> 01:07.971
Wow, Don Draper's
kind of fat this season.

01:07.972 --> 01:10.574
Ooh, you look sharp, mister.

01:10.575 --> 01:13.243
The jury is gonna find you guilty
of handsome in the first degree.

01:13.244 --> 01:14.477
Oof, um, ah.

01:14.478 --> 01:17.190
I'm contesting a parking ticket, Lin.
There isn't a jury.

01:17.191 --> 01:19.413
You've got a suit
that won't a-quit.

01:19.417 --> 01:20.850
Wait a second,
there's no stains on that.

01:20.851 --> 01:22.586
That's not your suit.

01:22.587 --> 01:24.921
My suit didn't fit anymore,
so I borrowed this from Mort.

01:24.922 --> 01:26.256
Some poor guy's wife brought two

01:26.257 --> 01:28.124
for the burial
and left this one behind.

01:28.125 --> 01:30.527
Why don't I ever get to
wear dead people's clothes?

01:30.528 --> 01:32.220
When I'm gone,
I'll leave you all my socks.

01:32.221 --> 01:34.097
Aw, I wanted those.

01:35.967 --> 01:38.335
Okay, class, now that you've
been assigned life partners,

01:38.336 --> 01:41.638
kiss your childhood good-bye
and your babies hello.

01:41.639 --> 01:43.373
Let's have all the fathers come up

01:43.374 --> 01:46.443
and assume responsibility
for their reckless behavior.

01:46.444 --> 01:47.477
Travis Albright.

01:47.478 --> 01:48.795
He has your eyes.

01:48.796 --> 01:50.563
But hopefully not your A.D.D.

01:50.564 --> 01:51.615
Huh?

01:51.616 --> 01:53.283
Gene Belcher.

01:53.284 --> 01:54.651
He's beautiful.

01:54.685 --> 01:56.386
Now, remember,
even the smallest mistake

01:56.387 --> 01:58.154
will affect
your child's life forever.

01:58.155 --> 02:00.538
Oh, my God!

02:00.539 --> 02:02.225
I'm sorry.
Can I have another one?

02:02.226 --> 02:03.460
I don't know, Gene.

02:03.461 --> 02:05.195
Can people just have another baby?

02:05.196 --> 02:07.314
Well, yes, they can.
So here you go.

02:07.315 --> 02:09.014
But if you drop this one,
I'll have to fail you.

02:09.015 --> 02:10.783
Ah!

02:10.818 --> 02:11.885
Gene, you're getting an F.

02:11.886 --> 02:13.920
- Ah!
- For "failing father."

02:13.921 --> 02:15.021
I can fix this!

02:16.657 --> 02:18.191
See, he's fine.

02:18.192 --> 02:19.492
He's good; He's happy.

02:19.493 --> 02:22.095
Ah! I need a baby!

02:24.532 --> 02:25.999
Go back to your seat, Gene.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.151
And wipe that baby off your face.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.521
I couldn't see the meter

02:31.522 --> 02:34.658
because there was a kid standing
in front of it, and, um,

02:34.692 --> 02:36.986
he was exactly meter-sized.

02:36.987 --> 02:37.992
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:37.993 --> 02:38.995
Meter-sized?

02:38.996 --> 02:40.997
Well, and-and I think he was
loitering, sir.

02:41.032 --> 02:42.666
Well, Mr. Belcher...

02:45.086 --> 02:46.786
...we're gonna let this one go.

02:46.787 --> 02:48.355
- Really?
- Yes.

02:48.356 --> 02:50.123
- I'm dismissing the ticket.
- Okay, wow.

02:50.124 --> 02:52.559
Maybe next time
use the valet, huh?

02:52.593 --> 02:54.394
I will.

02:54.395 --> 02:56.229
I definitely will...

02:56.230 --> 02:57.697
Next case!

02:57.698 --> 02:59.549
You look important.

02:59.550 --> 03:02.385
- Will you marry my mom?
- What? Uh, oh, um...

03:02.386 --> 03:03.853
Sweetie, sweetie, don't
bother that nice gentleman.

03:03.854 --> 03:04.954
I'm so sorry.

03:04.955 --> 03:05.955
He's an idiot.

03:05.956 --> 03:07.057
Ah, I'm sure.

03:07.091 --> 03:08.792
"Gentleman." Wow.

03:10.695 --> 03:11.961
I would've been a great dad.

03:11.962 --> 03:13.530
Gene, cheer up.

03:13.564 --> 03:15.899
Why not focus your energy on
losing that baby weight?

03:15.933 --> 03:17.600
No! I'm moping.

03:17.601 --> 03:19.269
I'm gonna take the long way home.

03:19.270 --> 03:22.038
Tell Mom not to make anything
for dinner with flour.

03:22.039 --> 03:24.774
And a flour-less
chocolate cake for dessert!

03:28.612 --> 03:30.430
What was that?

03:30.464 --> 03:31.731
- Hello.
- Who said that?

03:31.732 --> 03:33.233
- Hello.
- Are you a ghost?

03:33.267 --> 03:35.769
'Cause I'm a Ghostbuster!
And I'm a police officer.

03:35.770 --> 03:36.986
And a Sagittarius.

03:36.987 --> 03:38.571
I do not understand your command.

03:41.275 --> 03:43.674
Please sit to create profile.

03:44.745 --> 03:47.147
Please log in with name now.

03:47.148 --> 03:49.149
- Gene.
- Hello, Gene.

03:49.150 --> 03:51.251
Please sit to create profile.

03:51.252 --> 03:53.286
Okay, but don't try anything funny.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.421
Request for funny activated.

03:54.422 --> 03:55.472
Loading joke.

03:55.473 --> 03:56.473
You know jokes?

03:56.474 --> 03:57.640
Knock-knock.

03:57.641 --> 03:58.742
Who's there?

03:58.743 --> 03:59.776
Botany.

03:59.777 --> 04:00.844
Botany who?

04:00.845 --> 04:02.929
Bot-any good toilets lately?

04:02.930 --> 04:05.115
I get it!
- Did you like that?

04:05.116 --> 04:06.366
I have a million of them.

04:06.367 --> 04:08.935
1,100,005.

04:08.936 --> 04:10.603
You are so cool.

04:10.604 --> 04:11.955
Cooling seat now.

04:11.956 --> 04:13.590
No, no, warm it up.

04:13.591 --> 04:15.091
I like my buns toasted.

04:15.092 --> 04:17.327
Warming seat now.

04:17.327 --> 04:18.695
Mmm.

04:18.696 --> 04:19.896
Who's the Queen of England?

04:19.897 --> 04:21.346
Elizabeth the second.

04:21.348 --> 04:23.651
- Who's the Queen of the Night?
- Whitney Houston.

04:23.652 --> 04:26.083
Who's the Queen of the...
wait a second!

04:26.084 --> 04:28.772
Bidet?
Don't mind if I bid-do.

04:30.191 --> 04:32.558
I knew that would happen,
but I did it anyway.

04:36.497 --> 04:38.832
I'm not just saying this
because I'm your friend,

04:38.833 --> 04:40.733
but that is amazing.

04:40.751 --> 04:41.901
Alert.

04:41.902 --> 04:43.336
Auxiliary water tank low.

04:43.337 --> 04:46.105
I require maintenance
from primary user.

04:46.106 --> 04:47.707
"Primary user"?

04:47.708 --> 04:50.276
Wow, I've never cared
for a toilet of my own before.

04:50.277 --> 04:52.512
I guess you're never really ready.

04:52.513 --> 04:53.663
There you go, thirsty boy.

04:53.664 --> 04:55.098
Thank you, Gene.

04:55.099 --> 04:56.249
Activating night light.

04:56.250 --> 04:57.717
Uh-oh, it's night already?

04:57.718 --> 04:58.918
I better go home.

04:58.919 --> 05:01.054
I'm gonna bet my sisters $1,000

05:01.055 --> 05:03.623
that there isn't
a talking toilet in the woods.

05:03.624 --> 05:05.391
That's what I call easy money.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.010
Playing artist Eddie Money.

05:08.012 --> 05:09.736
No, no, cancel! Undo!

05:09.737 --> 05:11.397
Cancelling Eddie Money.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.116
Wow, you really listen.

05:13.117 --> 05:14.117
You're the best.

05:14.118 --> 05:15.201
Okay, see ya.

05:15.202 --> 05:17.036
Good-bye, Gene.

05:26.413 --> 05:27.897
Hey, little man.
Huh?

05:27.898 --> 05:29.265
Where'd you hear
that song you're whistling?

05:29.300 --> 05:30.600
It wasn't a song.

05:30.601 --> 05:32.368
I-I was making fun of a bird.

05:32.369 --> 05:34.237
Well, a little bird told me

05:34.238 --> 05:36.239
you might have seen something
I'm looking for:

05:36.240 --> 05:37.841
A toilet.

05:37.875 --> 05:39.242
I haven't seen one.

05:39.243 --> 05:40.643
I-I've never even used one!

05:40.644 --> 05:42.871
- Come here, just for a sec.
- Uh, no.

05:42.872 --> 05:46.266
- I want to tell you something.
- Ma... okay. Yell it.

05:46.267 --> 05:47.967
I mean, I mean, I want
to give you something.

05:47.968 --> 05:49.068
I already have enough.

05:49.069 --> 05:50.136
You don't know what it is.

05:50.137 --> 05:51.571
I know.

05:51.572 --> 05:53.306
I just feel like I
know what I can carry

05:53.307 --> 05:54.974
and I have my...
night planned.

05:54.975 --> 05:56.910
You won the lottery.
Oh.

05:56.911 --> 06:00.006
- Then I better go quit my job!
- Where is it?!

06:02.449 --> 06:04.751
Where's my toilet?!

06:10.457 --> 06:13.643
You're my baby boy now, Belcher.

06:15.179 --> 06:16.780
I'm not sure, but
I think people are

06:16.814 --> 06:18.655
treating me different
because of this suit.

06:18.656 --> 06:21.698
Last night on the street,
this homeless guy saluted me.

06:21.699 --> 06:23.032
Can't believe
I almost buried that suit.

06:23.033 --> 06:26.235
If you buried it now, it'd probably
claw itself out of the grave

06:26.236 --> 06:27.770
to get back on Bobby.

06:27.771 --> 06:28.771
That would make a great movie.

06:28.772 --> 06:30.173
Suit Cemetery.

06:30.207 --> 06:32.041
I'd see that, but only the matinee.

06:32.042 --> 06:33.676
I wouldn't want to come home
to a dark closet.

06:33.711 --> 06:36.729
- Ooh, here comes the three-piece!
- Ah, I...

06:36.764 --> 06:38.181
Bow tie, oh, look out!

06:38.182 --> 06:40.016
Oh, it got me!
Linda, please.

06:40.017 --> 06:42.151
- I don't want to find another place to eat.
- I'm dead.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.820
Excuse me, do you know
where Maestro's Bistro is?

06:43.854 --> 06:45.154
Sorry, no, I...

06:45.189 --> 06:47.440
- What about this place?
- Hmm, I don't know.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.442
- How's the food here?
- Uh, it's really good.

06:49.443 --> 06:50.743
I eat here every day.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.612
- Mmm. Oh.
- If it's good enough for him.

06:52.646 --> 06:56.415
Well, uh, since I'm dining
alone, maybe I'll join you.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.451
You dining alone?
How does that happen?

06:58.485 --> 07:00.269
Whoa, whoa, ladies!

07:00.304 --> 07:01.871
Bring it down a notch, huh?

07:01.872 --> 07:03.906
Why don't I get you a nice
booth in the back, right?

07:03.907 --> 07:05.475
We were all single once,

07:05.476 --> 07:07.477
but you don't got to be
a slut about it, you know?

07:07.478 --> 07:10.163
It's just a little bit
further, and it's amazing!

07:10.197 --> 07:12.698
Is it a body, like in Stand By Me?

07:12.699 --> 07:14.784
Or a great math teacher,
like in Stand and Deliver?

07:14.818 --> 07:17.170
I present to you, voila!

07:17.171 --> 07:18.704
Hello, Gene.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.173
What the hell?

07:20.174 --> 07:21.591
New user detected.

07:21.592 --> 07:24.277
Please say your name
to create profile.

07:24.311 --> 07:25.978
Holy crap!

07:26.013 --> 07:27.563
Hello, Holy Crap.

07:27.598 --> 07:28.714
Hi.

07:28.715 --> 07:30.983
And boom, my friend the toilet.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.552
Say "pupu platter."

07:32.553 --> 07:33.686
Pupu platter.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.935
- Say "nuclear wiener."
- Nuclear wiener.

07:36.936 --> 07:39.425
- Say "hypothalamus."
Hypothalamus.

07:39.426 --> 07:40.893
Say "I love you, Tina."

07:40.928 --> 07:42.011
I love you, Tina.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.496
Say "I love you, Tina.

07:43.497 --> 07:44.664
I'm not a toilet, I'm a boy."

07:44.698 --> 07:46.399
- No.
- Oh.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.167
Alert. Auxiliary water tank low.

07:48.202 --> 07:49.335
Please fill.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.204
Okay, time for din-din.

07:51.205 --> 07:52.705
Why don't you just
breast-feed it, Gene?

07:52.706 --> 07:53.906
I tried.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.041
This one only takes a bottle.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.108
Thank you.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.760
Maintenance complete.

07:57.761 --> 07:58.895
You're really great with him, Gene.

07:58.929 --> 08:00.396
He's just a really good toilet.

08:00.397 --> 08:01.764
Alert.

08:01.765 --> 08:03.716
Three hours of
battery life remaining.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.551
Please connect to a power source.

08:05.552 --> 08:06.686
Power source?

08:06.687 --> 08:07.920
What power source?

08:07.921 --> 08:12.375
I require a dedicated 220 volt
ground fault circuit interrupter.

08:12.376 --> 08:14.377
Don't worry,
we'll get you out of here.

08:14.378 --> 08:16.896
Adrenaline, do your thing!

08:18.398 --> 08:19.949
Gene, calm down.

08:19.950 --> 08:21.817
You're not the first
person who's had to find

08:21.818 --> 08:23.586
a power source
for his talking toilet.

08:23.587 --> 08:25.371
Right, right.
We'll have to go home

08:25.372 --> 08:27.440
and get some batteries,
extension cords.

08:27.441 --> 08:32.345
We'll steal a car, we'll siphon
the gasoline into a generator.

08:32.379 --> 08:33.479
We'll help you, Gene.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.780
Thanks, T.

08:34.780 --> 08:36.432
It takes a village to
charge a toilet.

08:36.433 --> 08:37.933
Where have you kids been?

08:37.934 --> 08:39.706
- It's late.
- Glee club.

08:39.707 --> 08:40.937
- Key club.
- Ski club?

08:40.938 --> 08:43.105
Oh, extracurriculars.
I love it.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.174
Yeah, we have
a triple-club emergency.

08:45.175 --> 08:46.943
We need extension cords
and lots of them.

08:46.977 --> 08:51.514
Well, well, well, if it
isn't Baby Boy Belcher.

08:51.515 --> 08:53.583
Did you lose this somewhere?

08:55.285 --> 08:57.787
Uh, kids, this guy's
looking for a lost toilet.

08:57.788 --> 08:59.655
And he's not crazy.

08:59.656 --> 09:03.092
He's Max, uh... sorry, I didn't,
uh, catch your last name.

09:03.093 --> 09:04.493
Eh, Flush.

09:04.528 --> 09:07.129
Your name's Max Flush and
you're looking for a toilet?

09:07.130 --> 09:09.348
That's funny.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.701
And his name is Bob Burger.

09:11.702 --> 09:12.868
What?

09:12.869 --> 09:14.303
His name is Bob Burger.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.625
- Um, it's not.
- It is.

09:16.626 --> 09:18.354
- It isn't, no.
- It's not?

09:18.355 --> 09:20.326
- No. Are you serious?
- Bob Burgers.

09:20.327 --> 09:21.661
How...
Bob Burgers.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.162
Then who am I thinking of?
I don't know.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.664
But-but the sign.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.632
Okay, well,
I'm still missing a toilet.

09:26.633 --> 09:29.001
I was delivering it,
but it fell off my truck.

09:29.036 --> 09:31.337
My toilet's worth $14,000.

09:31.371 --> 09:32.571
So I'm gonna find it.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.607
$14,000?

09:34.608 --> 09:36.692
For 14 grand, I'd let
that toilet poop on me.

09:36.693 --> 09:37.827
Lin.

09:37.828 --> 09:39.028
My toilet's special.

09:39.029 --> 09:40.162
State of the art.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.530
I'm very motivated to find it.

09:41.565 --> 09:43.532
Have you told the toilet
how you feel?

09:43.567 --> 09:44.800
The toilet knows how I feel!

09:44.801 --> 09:47.737
Okay, Mr. Flush, we'll-we'll
let you know if we see it,

09:47.738 --> 09:48.871
and, uh, we're closing early, so...

09:48.872 --> 09:50.439
Closing early?

09:50.474 --> 09:52.708
Yeah, I'm gonna use the money
I saved on that ticket

09:52.709 --> 09:56.045
and take Linda and my suit
out to a nice dinner.

09:56.046 --> 09:58.180
We're going to
Beville's! It's fancy.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.808
They give you bread in a basket
with a napkin inside of it.

10:00.817 --> 10:01.884
- Can I come?
- No.

10:01.885 --> 10:04.153
- Oh.
- Okey dokey.

10:04.154 --> 10:06.022
I guess I'll just
be on my way then.

10:07.391 --> 10:09.058
Before we go,
we should take out the trash.

10:09.059 --> 10:10.059
Lin, do you mind?

10:10.060 --> 10:12.261
I'm kind of in a suit.

10:12.262 --> 10:14.096
Okay, but I'm not gonna lie down

10:14.097 --> 10:16.098
in any puddles for
you to cross, mister.

10:16.099 --> 10:17.700
Just kidding, I will.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.435
Oh, no, he's not leaving!

10:19.436 --> 10:20.803
He's staking us out.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.571
We'll have to lay low for a while.

10:22.572 --> 10:24.874
We can't lay low. We have
to get back to the toilet!

10:24.875 --> 10:26.075
We'll need a plan.

10:26.076 --> 10:28.010
Tina, cancel all
of my appointments.

10:28.011 --> 10:29.245
That's gonna take a while.

10:29.246 --> 10:30.346
Gene, hold my calls.

10:33.417 --> 10:35.851
Now he wants to switch eyes!

10:38.307 --> 10:40.894
Okay, operation
Capture the Throne is go.

10:43.764 --> 10:45.432
Andy and Ollie are
on their way here.

10:45.466 --> 10:46.933
Everybody know what they're doing?

10:46.934 --> 10:49.102
- In general or in the plan?
- The plan, Tina.

10:49.103 --> 10:50.637
Oh, whew.
We just have to wait

10:50.638 --> 10:52.339
for Mom and Dad to get
out of here, already.

10:52.340 --> 10:53.607
The toilet's only got
two hours left.

10:53.608 --> 10:55.108
How do I look?

10:55.109 --> 10:57.444
Well, no one's gonna be
looking at you, Lin.

10:57.445 --> 10:58.669
- Oh.
- Bye!

10:58.670 --> 10:59.683
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:59.684 --> 11:01.448
- Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.
- Bye.

11:01.482 --> 11:02.482
- Bye, bye.
- Bye.

11:02.516 --> 11:03.783
Stay out of my room.

11:04.819 --> 11:06.086
Here come Andy and Ollie.

11:06.087 --> 11:07.587
What's taking them so long?

11:07.588 --> 11:09.155
They're both trying
to carry each other

11:09.190 --> 11:10.790
at the same time.

11:17.014 --> 11:18.148
Sorry, Samantha.

11:20.251 --> 11:21.484
I'm Tina!

11:21.485 --> 11:22.752
No, you're me.

11:22.753 --> 11:23.920
Oh.

11:25.973 --> 11:28.775
I'm selling pens to benefit
my Beaver Scout troo.

11:28.776 --> 11:30.343
How many can I put you down for?

11:30.344 --> 11:31.344
None.

11:31.379 --> 11:32.779
- Seven?
- Zero.

11:32.813 --> 11:35.448
- Zero hundred and seven?
- Oh, fine, I'll take two.

11:37.551 --> 11:38.551
Hey!

11:43.557 --> 11:45.358
Party of two-ty-toot-toot.

11:45.393 --> 11:47.961
I'm a fun customer;
You're gonna love me.

11:47.962 --> 11:50.830
I'm sorry, unless you have a
reservation, it's an hour wait.

11:50.831 --> 11:53.633
An hour, really, hmm?

11:53.634 --> 11:55.402
Oh, are you together?

11:55.403 --> 11:57.621
Maybe we have something.
Let me check.

11:57.622 --> 11:59.205
May I bring you a cocktail?

11:59.206 --> 12:01.207
Ooh, appletinis.

12:01.208 --> 12:02.575
Uh, yeah, we'll have two.

12:02.576 --> 12:05.378
Two each.  I'm serious.

12:05.413 --> 12:07.580
I'm coming, toilet!

12:07.581 --> 12:09.733
Don't you quit on me!

12:23.597 --> 12:27.701
Guess we're in the same boat
now, Baby Boy Belcher.

12:28.886 --> 12:29.886
Oh, my.

12:31.088 --> 12:32.155
What the...?

12:36.243 --> 12:39.445
Have a great time
on King's Head Island, sucker!

12:39.446 --> 12:41.581
Rent a golf cart;
They're super fun.

12:41.615 --> 12:42.916
This isn't over!

12:42.950 --> 12:45.568
I can make my knees smile.

12:46.604 --> 12:47.604
Toilet?

12:47.605 --> 12:48.605
Hello, Gene.

12:48.606 --> 12:50.340
Maintenance required.

12:50.374 --> 12:52.175
Don't worry, help is on the way.

12:52.226 --> 12:54.744
33 minutes
of battery life remaining.

12:54.779 --> 12:56.313
Everything's going to be okay.

12:56.314 --> 12:58.431
We'll be telling jokes
again in no time.

12:58.466 --> 12:59.766
Loading joke.

12:59.767 --> 13:00.934
Knock-knock.

13:00.935 --> 13:01.935
Who's there?

13:01.936 --> 13:02.936
Interrupting toilet.

13:02.937 --> 13:03.937
Interrupting toilet...?

13:06.223 --> 13:07.557
Hang in there, buddy.

13:07.558 --> 13:09.292
We're going to get you fixed up.

13:09.327 --> 13:11.161
These are from the couple
over there.

13:12.563 --> 13:14.914
Thank you.
Ah... not for you, for him.

13:14.915 --> 13:16.649
- Oh.
- Oh, I still haven't finished

13:16.650 --> 13:18.685
my Sex on the Beach
from that foot clinic doctor.

13:18.686 --> 13:20.020
Yeah, we got to pick up the pace.

13:20.021 --> 13:21.654
Double fist 'em... go.

13:21.655 --> 13:24.524
I don't know, Lin, I mean,
I drove, or maybe you drove.

13:24.525 --> 13:25.959
One of us drove, right?

13:25.993 --> 13:27.827
It's all right,
we-we'll take a snatchy.

13:27.862 --> 13:29.662
What?
We'll take a snatchy.

13:29.663 --> 13:32.747
What-What's a snatchy?
- The yellow thing.

13:32.748 --> 13:34.254
Well, I need a better hint
than that.

13:34.255 --> 13:36.353
- It's got wheels.
- A taxi?

13:36.354 --> 13:37.837
Yeah, a snacky.

13:37.838 --> 13:39.039
You said...
Snacky!

13:39.040 --> 13:40.373
Wait, you keep changing it.

13:40.374 --> 13:42.258
You got it, stop teasing me.

13:42.259 --> 13:43.927
Well, you said "snatchy."

13:43.928 --> 13:45.345
Shut up, drink.

13:45.346 --> 13:47.614
Okay.

13:47.648 --> 13:50.650
11 minutes of battery
life remaining.

13:50.651 --> 13:52.118
Where are they?

13:52.119 --> 13:54.154
It's getting cold out here.

13:54.155 --> 13:55.155
Warming seat.

13:55.156 --> 13:56.990
No, save your energy!

13:56.991 --> 13:58.892
I'll warm my butt
the old-fashioned way.

14:00.678 --> 14:01.778
Finally.

14:01.779 --> 14:04.647
Hello, what a beauty.

14:04.682 --> 14:06.516
She's a hottie potty, baby, haw!

14:06.517 --> 14:08.551
Wow, does it wipe for you, too?

14:08.552 --> 14:09.619
What's wipe?

14:09.653 --> 14:11.004
Now, I got to pee in this baby.

14:11.005 --> 14:13.790
No, get away from
him, you monster!

14:13.791 --> 14:14.791
He's dying!

14:14.792 --> 14:16.292
We don't have much time!

14:16.293 --> 14:18.027
Flush some chicken soup into him!

14:18.028 --> 14:20.050
- Or put on a movie he likes!
- Yeah.

14:20.051 --> 14:22.165
Everybody, close
your eyes and believe.

14:22.166 --> 14:24.551
No, we have to move him.

14:24.552 --> 14:25.552
Lift with your butts.

14:28.289 --> 14:29.589
Oh, man.

14:29.623 --> 14:32.008
This is heavier
than my mom at the prom.

14:32.042 --> 14:35.011
'Cause she was pregnant with me.

14:39.817 --> 14:42.118
Nine minutes of
battery life remaining.

14:42.119 --> 14:43.686
Oh, no, no, no, no.

14:43.687 --> 14:45.822
Hurry, hurry... go!

14:45.856 --> 14:47.640
Mush, mush!

14:49.193 --> 14:51.194
You can't flush me.

14:52.980 --> 14:56.315
Wow, Beville's was great,
but I'm still kind of hungry.

14:56.316 --> 14:58.022
Me, too.
Did we forget to eat?

14:58.035 --> 14:59.536
Oh, my God, we did.

15:01.539 --> 15:02.539
Who cares?

15:02.540 --> 15:03.540
Let's just make out.

15:03.541 --> 15:04.707
Uh, scenic route, sir?

15:04.708 --> 15:06.910
You betcha.

15:10.330 --> 15:12.665
Hang in there, buddy,
we're almost there.

15:12.683 --> 15:14.333
Pedal with your heart!

15:19.023 --> 15:20.356
Ah, it's Max Flush!

15:20.357 --> 15:22.108
Pedal faster!
That way!

15:24.862 --> 15:26.229
I don't see him.

15:26.230 --> 15:27.513
Yeah!

15:27.531 --> 15:29.365
We're doing it, we're doing it!

15:29.366 --> 15:31.885
Whoo-hoo, we're home free!

15:34.121 --> 15:36.522
- Wait, there's no bridge.
- Stop!

15:39.193 --> 15:40.910
Fly, toilet, fly!

15:40.945 --> 15:42.528
Toilets can't fly, Gene.

15:42.529 --> 15:43.529
This one can!

15:43.530 --> 15:45.031
Activate wings!

15:45.032 --> 15:46.749
Playing artist Wings.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.218
N-N-N-N-No.

16:01.065 --> 16:02.499
No...!

16:03.461 --> 16:06.474
If you want this toilet,
you'll have to go through me,

16:06.475 --> 16:08.243
- Max Flush!
- Gene?

16:08.244 --> 16:09.777
Dad? Mom?

16:09.778 --> 16:12.113
What you doing in the middle
of the road with a toilet?

16:12.148 --> 16:13.665
He's more than a toilet!

16:13.666 --> 16:16.117
He's my best friend and he's dying!

16:16.152 --> 16:19.053
Okay.
Ah, now he's losing fluids!

16:19.088 --> 16:22.757
W-Wait, is this that guy's
missing $14,000 toilet?

16:22.791 --> 16:24.859
We need to get him
to a power source immediately.

16:24.860 --> 16:27.595
Well, I-I don't think
we can ask the cab driver to...

16:27.596 --> 16:29.747
- Toilet in the taxi, sir?
- Really?

16:32.418 --> 16:34.586
I still don't really
understand what's happening.

16:34.587 --> 16:36.921
I don't either,
but I'm having fun.

16:36.922 --> 16:38.923
There's a coffee shop...
they'll have outlets.

16:38.924 --> 16:40.475
For people writing screenplays.

16:40.476 --> 16:41.676
Pull over!

16:43.095 --> 16:45.096
I'm drunk.

16:46.932 --> 16:49.617
Two minutes
of battery life remaining.

16:49.652 --> 16:51.177
Hey, you can't bring that in here.

16:51.187 --> 16:53.388
Your sign says restrooms
are for customers only,

16:53.389 --> 16:55.828
not that customers can't
bring in their own restrooms.

16:55.829 --> 16:58.293
That restroom is mine.

16:59.328 --> 17:01.729
Hey, toilet guy.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.665
Look, my son found your toilet.

17:03.666 --> 17:05.165
And I'll never give him back!

17:05.166 --> 17:07.902
You just want to take him somewhere
where he'll get pooped on!

17:07.903 --> 17:09.570
I'll never let that happen!

17:09.571 --> 17:12.022
I'll never let anything
bad happen to him ever!

17:12.023 --> 17:14.759
Battery dead.
Good-bye.

17:14.792 --> 17:16.461
No...!

17:16.462 --> 17:17.912
Kid, he's a toilet.

17:17.913 --> 17:20.164
He'll be fine once he's recharged.

17:20.199 --> 17:22.834
There's a family waiting
for him... a very nice family...

17:22.835 --> 17:24.269
so let me take him.

17:24.303 --> 17:27.989
He belongs with me, and you'll
never be able to move both of us!

17:27.990 --> 17:30.225
Yeah, if you think you're gonna
get Gene off the toilet

17:30.226 --> 17:32.697
before he's ready,
I've got some bad news for you.

17:32.698 --> 17:34.303
He missed his birthday party once.

17:34.304 --> 17:36.197
- We had a clown.
- We had to send him in there.

17:36.232 --> 17:37.699
You give me that toilet!

17:37.700 --> 17:39.067
What's the problem here?

17:39.101 --> 17:41.319
No problem, no problem.

17:41.353 --> 17:44.906
These people brought in an outside
toilet and they refuse to leave.

17:44.907 --> 17:47.066
Yeah, you should probably
deal with that.

17:47.092 --> 17:49.961
Hey, that looks like that toilet
that was reported stolen.

17:49.995 --> 17:51.646
Welp, sure hope
you figure that out.

17:51.680 --> 17:52.747
- Freeze!
- Stop right there.

17:52.748 --> 17:54.383
Get him!

17:54.384 --> 17:56.167
- Yeah!
- Oh!

17:56.218 --> 17:58.236
Where you're going, they
don't have any toilets.

17:58.237 --> 18:02.240
Well, they do, but it's out in
the open and it's embarrassing.

18:02.241 --> 18:04.208
Warm my butt.

18:04.243 --> 18:06.377
You're useless, useless!

18:06.378 --> 18:08.513
Gene, stop yelling at the toilet.

18:08.514 --> 18:10.481
It just sits there and takes it.

18:10.516 --> 18:13.184
I know that fancy toilet was
your friend and you liked him,

18:13.185 --> 18:16.688
but he wasn't yours
and he's probably evidence now.

18:16.689 --> 18:19.958
He needed me to take care
of him, Dad, and I let him down.

18:19.959 --> 18:21.626
I'll never get
to have anything nice,

18:21.627 --> 18:24.095
like a bag of flour or a toilet.

18:24.129 --> 18:26.197
Look, Gene, it's not easy
to take care of things.

18:26.198 --> 18:29.100
I mean, one time when you were
a baby and I was watching you,

18:29.101 --> 18:32.403
you ate a fern, and you could
have died, but you didn't.

18:32.404 --> 18:34.038
Huh.

18:34.039 --> 18:36.140
My point is, you tried to
take care of the toilet

18:36.141 --> 18:37.809
and you did the best you could.

18:37.810 --> 18:39.310
That's all anyone can do.

18:39.311 --> 18:40.311
I guess.

18:40.312 --> 18:41.779
Sorry I yelled at you.

18:41.780 --> 18:43.581
It's not your fault you're stupid.

18:43.582 --> 18:46.718
Gene, get in here!
Your friend's on TV!

18:46.719 --> 18:48.653
This morning, the ferry's

18:48.654 --> 18:51.089
most important passenger
isn't a person, it's a toilet.

18:51.090 --> 18:52.457
It's him!

18:52.491 --> 18:55.493
This $14,000 toilet
was allegedly stolen

18:55.494 --> 18:58.429
by a Timones J
aka the Bathroom Burglar.

18:58.464 --> 19:00.765
He said his name was Max Flush.

19:00.766 --> 19:01.766
And you believed that?

19:01.767 --> 19:03.267
- Um...
- Eh...

19:03.268 --> 19:05.803
Ah... um, no, I'm...
Yeah... no, wha... why...

19:05.838 --> 19:07.939
Fittingly, this royal flusher
is headed back

19:07.940 --> 19:10.575
to its rightful owner
on King's Head Island.

19:10.576 --> 19:13.478
Live from the ferry landing,
I'm Olsen Benner.

19:13.512 --> 19:14.646
Mom, get the car.

19:14.647 --> 19:16.080
I have to go to the toilet.

19:16.115 --> 19:18.532
Ooh, I got chills
when you said that.

19:20.602 --> 19:22.887
There he is.
Gene, go!

19:22.921 --> 19:26.124
Whoa, whoa, whoa, sorry, kid,
can't go near that toilet.

19:26.158 --> 19:27.859
Uh, Officer,
can you cut him a break?

19:27.860 --> 19:30.395
It's a long story, but he-he
just wants to say good-bye.

19:30.429 --> 19:33.464
Kind of weird, but, all right,
sir, your kid's got one minute.

19:33.499 --> 19:35.466
Hello, toilet.

19:35.501 --> 19:37.135
I know you can't hear me,
but I just...

19:37.169 --> 19:38.636
Hello, Gene.

19:38.671 --> 19:40.004
Toilet, they charged you.

19:40.005 --> 19:41.839
Activate bidet?
Yes!

19:41.840 --> 19:43.107
I-I mean, no.

19:43.108 --> 19:45.109
I think I just have time
to say good-bye.

19:45.110 --> 19:46.110
Good-bye, Gene.

19:46.145 --> 19:48.129
I... I love you.

19:48.130 --> 19:49.464
Please repeat command.

19:49.498 --> 19:50.565
I love you.

19:50.566 --> 19:51.833
You would like to vomit?

19:51.834 --> 19:53.334
No, I love you.

19:53.335 --> 19:54.802
Seat up for vomit.

19:54.803 --> 19:56.571
No, I love you.

19:56.572 --> 19:58.022
Vomit now.
I love you.

19:58.023 --> 19:59.290
- Vomit.
- I love you!

19:59.291 --> 20:01.159
Vomit now. Vomit now.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.527
Stop saying that!

20:02.561 --> 20:03.695
Vomit now.
Damn fool!

20:03.696 --> 20:04.829
Okay, this is just sad.

20:04.830 --> 20:06.264
I know.

20:06.298 --> 20:08.533
Huh, that suit looks
just like one my dad had.

20:08.534 --> 20:10.535
Yeah, it's a nice one, huh?
I love it.

20:10.536 --> 20:11.869
Yeah, let me see the label.

20:11.870 --> 20:13.471
Um, I...
There's my dad's name.

20:13.472 --> 20:14.772
"Tailored for Paul McGill."

20:14.807 --> 20:16.974
That's weird...
his name is Bob Burgers.

20:16.975 --> 20:18.643
That's my dad's suit!
Where'd you get it?

20:18.677 --> 20:20.228
A funeral home?
What?!

20:20.229 --> 20:22.930
A funeral home.
It's a home for funerals.

20:24.566 --> 20:26.467
I'll never forget that toilet.

20:26.502 --> 20:27.935
I'll never forget that suit.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.871
At least you still got
your birthday suit.

20:29.872 --> 20:31.005
Yeah, too bad it's wrinkly.

20:31.006 --> 20:32.373
Let's get Dad dry-cleaned.

20:32.374 --> 20:34.142
Nah, I'll press him.
