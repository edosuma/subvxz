00:20.937 --> 00:22.981
<i> Nora Ephron once wrote,</i>

00:23.606 --> 00:24.983
<i>"Men and women can't be friends</i>

00:25.066 --> 00:27.902
<i>because the sex part</i>
<i>always gets in the way."</i>

00:29.320 --> 00:31.364
<i>But we're making it work, Love.</i>

00:32.157 --> 00:33.241
<i>Keeping it simple.</i>

00:36.161 --> 00:37.203
<i>We're friends.</i>

00:45.545 --> 00:46.713
<i>Just friends.</i>

00:50.675 --> 00:52.218
Want you to know I wouldn't blame you.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.846
It's a tough scenario
when they go full sorority ho on ya.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.015
Oh, come on. She's...

00:57.682 --> 00:58.725
our boss.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.688
<i> And it's for the best.</i>

01:04.022 --> 01:07.317
<i>Can you imagine what I'd do to Calvin</i>
<i>if we were together?</i>

01:07.400 --> 01:09.110
<i>Or worse, what I might do...</i>

01:09.944 --> 01:10.779
<i>to you?</i>

01:13.073 --> 01:14.949
<i>You leave me gifts every day.</i>

01:16.367 --> 01:18.578
<i>I enjoy them as friendly offerings.</i>

01:18.661 --> 01:20.830
<i>I can't let them mean</i>
<i>anything more because you--</i>

01:22.123 --> 01:24.542
<i>Oh, that is phenomenal.</i>

01:26.711 --> 01:28.338
<i>We still spend time together.</i>

01:28.588 --> 01:32.300
<i>Between your busy work schedule</i>
<i>and volunteering at a soup kitchen...</i>

01:32.926 --> 01:34.886
<i>you could use all the help you can get.</i>

01:36.012 --> 01:37.597
<i>It's not that I don't want you.</i>

01:37.680 --> 01:39.682
<i>We have a connection, something deep.</i>

01:40.433 --> 01:42.310
<i>But the last time I loved someone...</i>

01:43.311 --> 01:45.897
<i>Well, I can't risk repeating history.</i>

01:49.818 --> 01:53.488
<i>So really, this is me protecting you</i>
<i>by being your friend.</i>

01:59.828 --> 02:01.246
<i>You see? This is easy.</i>

02:03.373 --> 02:04.207
<i>Platonic.</i>

02:06.209 --> 02:07.210
<i>Safe.</i>

02:15.051 --> 02:16.553
<i>Just friends.</i>

02:29.899 --> 02:30.984
I don't know, man.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.319
From what you're telling me...

02:34.279 --> 02:37.115
it would be easier
for you and this chick to...

02:37.615 --> 02:38.741
smash.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.493
Don't say "chick."

02:40.577 --> 02:42.162
Lady friend?

02:42.245 --> 02:43.913
You won't tell me her name, so...

02:45.874 --> 02:47.125
You gonna guess or what?

02:48.418 --> 02:49.460
T.

02:54.799 --> 02:55.633
D.

02:57.844 --> 02:58.678
S.

03:01.139 --> 03:01.973
M.

03:02.473 --> 03:03.766
Dude, slow down.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.810
You'll be dead before you kiss the girl.

03:07.478 --> 03:08.813
Hint, it's a place.

03:09.772 --> 03:10.607
Madrid.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.282
So is she pretty?

03:19.866 --> 03:21.034
I'll be back at lunch.

03:22.493 --> 03:25.288
Man, you could talk to me,
the least you could do is talk to me.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.708
You're living under a false name
in a new city,

03:29.167 --> 03:31.044
that's mega-lonely.

03:32.503 --> 03:34.339
Maybe you could use a friend, too.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.967
Like I said, I already have a friend.

03:38.509 --> 03:41.012
I don't think you understand
how friendship works.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.057
Man, I'm just kidding.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.186
How about
a heritage grain bowl for lunch?

03:53.733 --> 03:54.734
Oh, man.

03:54.817 --> 03:56.069
That was great.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.237
Okay.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.446
Hi.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.490
You can play. Just stay close.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.492
-You want to play?
-There you go, go on the slide.

04:02.575 --> 04:06.120
I promise we didn't drag you here just to
watch our child almost bash their face in.

04:06.204 --> 04:07.163
Yeah.

04:08.122 --> 04:10.291
We have news.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.961
-We have a date.
-For the wedding?

04:13.336 --> 04:16.589
-Yes.
- Oh, my God!

04:17.382 --> 04:18.800
When? Where?

04:18.883 --> 04:21.469
-October. It's a formality, obviously.
-It's more than an formality.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.221
-It's gonna be modest.
-It's gonna be huge.

04:23.304 --> 04:24.555
-We're on a budget.
-We're not.

04:25.306 --> 04:26.557
I want to make your cake.

04:26.641 --> 04:27.850
- No.
- No way, no.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.102
That's too much work for you.

04:29.185 --> 04:31.187
Your only job at this wedding
is to drink and dance.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.649
- Yeah.
-Please? I mean, I'll be amazing. It...

04:34.899 --> 04:37.110
Come on, it would mean so much to me. I...

04:38.111 --> 04:39.696
Not to be corny, but...

04:40.613 --> 04:42.615
baking is how I express my love.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.617
-Don't do that.
-Come on, don't break my heart.

04:45.368 --> 04:46.536
-Of course!
-Oh, fine!

04:46.619 --> 04:48.121
-Yes! Yeah-yeah-yeah!

04:48.204 --> 04:51.207
Oh, my God, okay, I am so excited.
I have so many ideas.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.127
And I have all this energy
that I don't know what to do with.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.128
Oh, there it is.

04:56.129 --> 04:56.963
What is where?

04:57.880 --> 05:00.758
You cook when you're happy
and you only bake when you're frustrated.

05:00.842 --> 05:04.220
Let me guess.
Will Bettelheim flaked on you <i>again.</i>

05:05.263 --> 05:06.472
Does he even exist?

05:06.556 --> 05:09.767
And if so, I'm sorry to say it,
but he's obviously not into you.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.728
Yeah, well, that's impossible.

05:12.103 --> 05:15.023
Okay, look, if you're determined
to ignore the red flags,

05:15.106 --> 05:17.025
then, yeah, you've gotta
take your cues from him.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.735
-Or a radical idea: Bumble.
-True.

05:18.818 --> 05:19.736
No.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.738
But the second
you start to feel desperate...

05:21.821 --> 05:23.197
-Ripcord.
-Yeah.

05:25.867 --> 05:26.743
We'll see.

05:27.785 --> 05:31.539
I'm definitely walking the line between
desperate and, you know, shameless.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.421
<i> Will, hope you're not triggered</i>
<i>by the word "moist."</i>

05:46.304 --> 05:49.140
<i>Oh, it's like eating pure sex.</i>

05:49.223 --> 05:51.225
<i>How am I supposed to resist this?</i>

05:51.309 --> 05:53.353
<i>If only the universe</i>
<i>would send me some sign,</i>

05:53.436 --> 05:56.147
<i>some platonic way</i>
<i>to stay in your good graces.</i>

05:56.230 --> 05:58.649
William fucking Bettelheim.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.401
<i>Can I get a different sign?</i>

06:02.403 --> 06:03.863
Love's buns, am I right?

06:03.946 --> 06:06.157
<i> Well,</i>
<i>that's accidentally horrifying.</i>

06:06.240 --> 06:07.658
Your sister's very talented.

06:07.742 --> 06:10.995
<i>Whereas your twin brother</i>
<i>literally reeks of privilege.</i>

06:11.079 --> 06:12.955
<i>Who shows up to work unshowered?</i>

06:13.039 --> 06:15.166
<i>Who shows up anywhere in a kimono?</i>

06:15.249 --> 06:18.127
So, I couldn't help but notice,

06:18.211 --> 06:20.171
you are crushing it.

06:20.254 --> 06:23.883
Like, customers are talking about books.

06:23.966 --> 06:25.551
<i> This is about Love, clearly.</i>

06:25.635 --> 06:27.428
<i>Does he not know I'm not a threat?</i>

06:27.512 --> 06:29.305
But if I might humbly

06:29.389 --> 06:30.932
make one suggestion...

06:31.015 --> 06:33.976
<i> Here it comes, some clumsy version</i>
<i>of "stay away from my sister."</i>

06:34.060 --> 06:35.144
Journals.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.189
You know, the muse strikes like lightning,

06:38.272 --> 06:41.567
and the best ideas are always
the ones that slip away.

06:41.984 --> 06:43.027
You're a writer.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.322
Director-producer, but writer first.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.409
<i> I almost forgot, this is LA.</i>
<i>He's not interested in me,</i>

06:49.492 --> 06:51.327
<i>he needs me to be interested in him.</i>

06:51.411 --> 06:54.664
You know, managing the store
just kinda helps me recharge.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.874
I've got five features in development,

06:56.958 --> 06:58.835
two properties I'm chasing.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.378
<i> Love, I'm not stupid.</i>

07:00.461 --> 07:02.338
<i>This mix of humblebrag and gibberish</i>

07:02.422 --> 07:05.091
<i>is your douchebag brother's attempt</i>
<i>to keep his enemy close.</i>

07:05.174 --> 07:06.801
Annapurna actually is set to produce,

07:06.884 --> 07:10.304
and my dear friend, Daniel Day-Lewis,

07:10.388 --> 07:13.641
is attached to this dope pitch
I've been kicking around.

07:13.724 --> 07:16.227
<i>And last I checked,</i>
<i>family automatically trumps friends</i>

07:16.310 --> 07:17.562
<i>in the social hierarchy.</i>

07:17.645 --> 07:19.981
<i>I need to win this guy over.</i>

07:20.064 --> 07:25.778
But DDL's oeuvre is not about that
four-quadrant hero's journey bullshit.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.822
So I'm, like, birthing the scenes

07:27.905 --> 07:31.451
instead of impaling myself
on the rocks of a three-act structure.

07:31.534 --> 07:34.203
"A good story cannot be devised,

07:34.620 --> 07:36.164
it has to be distilled."

07:38.082 --> 07:39.041
That's Raymond Chandler.

07:39.917 --> 07:41.169
Exactly.

07:41.669 --> 07:42.920
Sport.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.174
Come with me to Harold Night after work.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.592
I'm talent scouting.

07:47.925 --> 07:48.968
An improv show?

07:49.051 --> 07:51.053
<i>I'd rather watch a cat massacre.</i>

07:51.137 --> 07:52.305
That sounds dope.

07:54.807 --> 07:58.811
Incoming... non-ironic brah request

07:58.895 --> 08:01.814
for one William Bettelheim.

08:07.403 --> 08:10.156
Gotta go. Gotta write my morning pages.

08:10.364 --> 08:11.949
<i> Maybe this is good, Love.</i>

08:12.408 --> 08:15.411
<i>A benign thing</i>
<i>that'll deepen our friendship.</i>

08:15.495 --> 08:17.497
<i>Now we share a brah.</i>

08:17.580 --> 08:18.789
<i>He's a social creature.</i>

08:18.873 --> 08:21.042
<i>Never alone, therefore never working.</i>

08:21.709 --> 08:24.462
<i>There you are, cute, innocent...</i>

08:24.545 --> 08:25.880
<i>Where did he go wrong?</i>

08:27.340 --> 08:30.468
<i>Forty wrote and directed</i>
<i>a short film called </i>The Third Twin...

08:30.551 --> 08:32.136
...au pair one summer.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.598
Uh, and so Love and I were making
our own breakfast.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.852
<i> ...that may have won a Grand Jury</i>
<i>prize at Sundance,</i>

08:39.936 --> 08:41.354
<i>and he hasn't done a thing since.</i>

08:41.437 --> 08:44.232
<i>His inspiration evaporated</i>
<i>in a haze of Hollywood parties</i>

08:44.315 --> 08:45.775
<i>and VIP events.</i>

08:45.858 --> 08:49.028
<i>Then at a certain point,</i>
<i>those evaporated too.</i>

08:49.111 --> 08:51.822
<i>Your brother is a sycophantic</i>
<i>fame-grubbing Hollywood has-been,</i>

08:51.906 --> 08:53.783
<i>so of course our first friend date</i>

08:53.866 --> 08:56.744
<i>is in a sea of sweaty,</i>

08:56.827 --> 08:58.996
<i>thirsty Hollywood outsiders.</i>

08:59.080 --> 09:01.040
You can't play that cello in here.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.375
This is daycare.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.002
-Wait, did someone move the symphony?

09:05.503 --> 09:08.130
<i> Young, hungry, and broke,</i>

09:08.214 --> 09:11.384
<i>masquerading as</i>
<i>actors-slash-writers-slash-directors</i>

09:11.467 --> 09:14.512
<i>to take the pain out of being</i>
<i>nannies-slash-baristas</i>

09:14.595 --> 09:15.721
<i>slash-disappointments.</i>

09:15.805 --> 09:20.059
<i>This room is a self-fellating</i>
<i>ouroboros of desperation.</i>

09:20.142 --> 09:23.187
<i>He isn't even watching.</i>
<i>What are we doing here?</i>

09:25.231 --> 09:26.190
You're crazy.

09:27.441 --> 09:29.402
All right, thank you!

09:29.735 --> 09:32.405
-We are Trigger Warning!

09:32.738 --> 09:33.906
But stay in your seats.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.659
We've got a special treat for you.

09:36.742 --> 09:37.952
It's a secret set

09:38.035 --> 09:40.037
from someone you may know.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.372
I knew it.

09:41.455 --> 09:42.748
Henderson!

09:48.129 --> 09:50.548
<i> A-ha! That's who we're here for.</i>

09:50.631 --> 09:54.051
Hendy and I go, like,  way back.
I'm-- I'm writing this role for him.

09:58.055 --> 10:00.933
-My skirt was pulled up.
-So you're saying Henderson...

10:03.436 --> 10:05.438
All right,
how many of you guys

10:05.521 --> 10:08.858
have seen the movie
and love the movie <i>Love Actually?</i>

10:08.941 --> 10:10.985
-All right, get the fuck out.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.405
I'm serious,
I don't want you laughing at my shit

10:14.488 --> 10:16.532
because then I'll be
second-guessing my taste.

10:17.158 --> 10:19.076
All right? All right, strap in

10:19.160 --> 10:22.913
and get ready for a 15 year old
cultural staple

10:22.997 --> 10:26.167
that's more cancerous
than my actual cancer.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.970
Um... So just, like, five minutes,

10:38.054 --> 10:40.473
I promise, just long enough
for me to reconnect with Hendy.

10:40.556 --> 10:41.891
Okay, hang on a second.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.267
From what you know, is he...

10:44.894 --> 10:45.811
Is he a good guy?

10:46.604 --> 10:48.814
Oh, yeah, he's like,<i> the best.</i>

10:48.898 --> 10:50.733
I mean,
he used to be kind of a party monster.

10:51.150 --> 10:54.904
Um, then the cancer, like,
really set him on, like, a higher path.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.781
Just... Okay.

10:58.074 --> 11:01.369
Jonah, man, long time no see, dude.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.454
Um, I just have
some business with Henderson.

11:03.537 --> 11:05.289
No, no. You've got some balls, Quinn.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.875
Come on, man. Like, you're a <i>manager </i>now.

11:07.958 --> 11:08.918
You're not a bouncer.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.336
I'm-- I'm sober now.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.421
Then take Henderson
off your amends tour.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.591
Okay, well, I'm sure
if you just let me speak to him...

11:16.801 --> 11:19.011
What, you're gonna let <i>her </i>through?
What is she? 13?

11:20.930 --> 11:22.473
-Are you serious, man?
-Ellie.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.141
<i>Oh, no.</i>

11:24.475 --> 11:26.644
Yeah, thank you. Appreciate it.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.355
Fucking manager.

11:30.106 --> 11:33.567
Five years ago,
that guy was Henderson's weed dealer.

11:33.651 --> 11:37.238
And he would not know talent
if he was choking on its dick.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.198
-Cool.
-Let's just go.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.244
<i>I would follow your brother,</i>
<i>but I think you'd agree,</i>

11:43.327 --> 11:46.622
<i>I need to follow</i>
<i>the unprotected 15-year-old first.</i>

11:56.674 --> 11:58.008
What's up, you need a ride home?

11:58.175 --> 12:00.970
Um, nah, I'm good. I'm a few blocks away.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.724
-No candy from strangers, huh?

12:06.559 --> 12:07.393
Have fun.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.068
-Ellie.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.362
You scared me.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.490
Oh, okay, this cannot be our thing.

12:22.032 --> 12:23.159
What, are you following me?

12:23.242 --> 12:25.119
-No, I was at the show.
-Why?

12:25.536 --> 12:26.454
You're not funny.

12:27.329 --> 12:28.497
I was with a friend.

12:29.123 --> 12:29.999
Listen, I have to ask.

12:30.583 --> 12:34.253
Uh, hanging out with Henderson,
you know, your-- your sister has...

12:34.503 --> 12:35.379
history with him.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.505
Oh, my God.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.841
Did Delilah put you up to this?

12:39.258 --> 12:41.260
Yeah, 'course I know she slept with him.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.554
He's one of a hundred,
she's one of a thousand.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.598
-So why are you hanging out with him?
-I'm not.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.391
I'm chasing an internship.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.268
And Delilah's okay with that?

12:50.770 --> 12:52.938
I stole Henderson's email
from her contacts.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.356
Don't you dare tell her.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.734
-Ellie, you know guys like that--
-Guys like what?

12:57.318 --> 12:59.570
Wait, let me guess. She called him a perv.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.238
Know who else she called that?

13:01.322 --> 13:04.408
Half the fucking cast
of <i>Sesame Street, </i>okay?

13:04.658 --> 13:07.369
It's her go-to.
And who do you think you are?

13:08.621 --> 13:10.164
Oh, my God, you're so kind.

13:10.247 --> 13:12.458
You're so protective.
You're like my daddy.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.126
- Is that what you like to hear?
-No.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.170
- Do you want to fuck me, William?
-No.

13:16.253 --> 13:17.880
-No, yeah, of course you do!
-Never mind.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.173
Of course you do!

13:19.256 --> 13:22.218
Everybody wants to fuck the 15-year-old!

13:22.718 --> 13:24.929
<i> Oy, she's precocious, all right.</i>

13:26.639 --> 13:29.141
<i>I'll leave the parenting</i>
<i>to her sister for now.</i>

13:32.102 --> 13:35.022
<i>Especially because</i>
<i>I have caretaking needs of my own.</i>

13:35.481 --> 13:38.234
Cafe Gratitude.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.402
What's the occasion?

13:42.238 --> 13:43.739
You got laid, didn't you?

13:44.031 --> 13:45.074
Tell me everything.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.037
U.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.004
You're an arm away from death.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.924
Serves you right for changing the subject
away from your lady friend.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.468
Well, there's nothing to talk about,
we're still friends.

14:04.552 --> 14:05.761
Still platonic.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.179
But why?

14:07.596 --> 14:10.933
'Cause her pheromonal effect on you
ceased overnight?

14:11.016 --> 14:12.893
No, it's not that I don't still...

14:12.977 --> 14:14.478
Well, what are you trying to prove?

14:15.980 --> 14:17.815
That I won't repeat history.

14:19.066 --> 14:20.025
With respect...

14:20.985 --> 14:23.946
you need to see a shrink
'cause you are fooling yourself.

14:24.947 --> 14:29.118
Your deal is we're all subconsciously
trying to date our moms over and over.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.661
Patterns are set young,

14:30.744 --> 14:34.123
and all romance is basically
reenacting parental dynam--

14:34.415 --> 14:36.667
What? I'm quoting my shrink.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.211
-Oh!
-And-- and he's right.

14:39.295 --> 14:42.047
Both my mom and my fiancée
are very withholding.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.174
I'm sorry, are-- are you married?

14:44.758 --> 14:45.593
Engaged.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.637
Her name is Gigi.
She lives in the Philippines.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.890
Is this the one
you sent all your money to?

14:50.973 --> 14:52.349
Yeah, man. I told you I love her.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.184
We met online.

14:55.185 --> 14:57.521
One day, we'll meet in person.

14:59.523 --> 15:03.611
Will, you are 100% disqualified
from giving me relationship advice.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.156
It's Manila.

15:08.657 --> 15:11.452
Well, yeah,
I gave you the biggest hint ever.

15:12.036 --> 15:15.205
Wait, hey, are we just gonna play games
until my meds run out again?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.751
If I have a future at this company,

15:18.834 --> 15:20.294
corner office, natural light.

15:21.211 --> 15:22.838
Transfer to another branch.

15:23.881 --> 15:27.051
When I know,
you will be the first to find out.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.596
Wait, you're not eating?

15:30.679 --> 15:32.514
No. No, the lady friend's a baker.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.183
What?

15:34.558 --> 15:36.560
Stop playing games
and just wife her already.

15:36.769 --> 15:40.147
Hey, and while you're at it,
take her name and give mine back to me.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.115
Hey, Love.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.159
Hey. How's it going?

15:52.701 --> 15:53.869
I'm already drooling.

15:58.874 --> 15:59.750
<i> Shit.</i>

16:00.709 --> 16:02.169
<i>Well, that's embarrassing.</i>

16:06.548 --> 16:08.467
Were-- were you expecting something?

16:08.717 --> 16:11.720
What? No. No, I didn't mean...

16:12.513 --> 16:13.764
It's not like I'm owed a muffin.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.266
-A muffin?
-Uh, a strudel.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.519
Maybe a light <i>religieuse.</i>

16:18.602 --> 16:19.770
Oh, great.

16:19.853 --> 16:21.647
Three-hour project,
I'll get right on that.

16:28.570 --> 16:29.697
This is weird, right?

16:30.364 --> 16:32.408
All I meant was that I'm grateful
for whatever I can get.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.659
Which is...

16:33.742 --> 16:35.327
whenever <i>you </i>want.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.830
-Or if you don't--
-You're right, this is weird.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.916
<i> Shit. If I could kiss you right now,</i>

16:41.000 --> 16:42.376
<i>you'd know I meant no harm.</i>

16:43.085 --> 16:46.630
<i>But apparently, friendships</i>
<i>are more fragile than relationships.</i>

16:54.930 --> 16:55.889
I'm sorry.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.810
For what?

17:00.477 --> 17:01.895
I just don't know what you expected.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.163
Sport.

17:19.747 --> 17:20.664
Hi.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.333
So, uh...

17:25.252 --> 17:27.588
Now that I know
you're not a crazy person...

17:27.921 --> 17:30.174
-I gotta ask.
-<i> And here it comes.</i>

17:30.257 --> 17:32.384
What are your intentions with my sister?

17:32.843 --> 17:34.928
<i>Apologize to you, marry you,</i>

17:35.012 --> 17:37.806
<i>send your brother</i>
<i>out of strangulation's reach.</i>

17:37.890 --> 17:38.974
Intentions?

17:39.058 --> 17:39.933
Yeah.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.061
Not to be all like, you know...

17:42.770 --> 17:43.771
but um...

17:44.229 --> 17:46.690
if you were to hurt my sister,

17:46.774 --> 17:50.736
I could make life
very difficult for you at the store.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.113
Love and I are just friends.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.033
Don't get me wrong, she's amazing.
I'm the problem.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.494
I'm kinda getting over some stuff,
you know?

17:58.702 --> 17:59.870
I'm working on myself.

17:59.953 --> 18:00.996
Oh, shit.

18:01.747 --> 18:02.623
Dude, are you...

18:03.040 --> 18:04.083
Are you in recovery?

18:04.166 --> 18:05.375
-<i> Nope.</i>
-Kinda.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.836
Man, me too. Which-- which program?

18:08.337 --> 18:09.171
SLAA?

18:09.505 --> 18:10.506
Wait.

18:10.672 --> 18:13.842
Just because I choose to live so openly
does not mean you have to answer that.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.470
I'm in AA, and you know...

18:17.679 --> 18:18.639
for right now...

18:19.431 --> 18:20.390
that's enough.

18:21.141 --> 18:21.975
Thanks, man.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.894
Yeah. You know, I um...

18:24.478 --> 18:27.815
actually have this killer idea
for, like, a psychological thriller

18:27.898 --> 18:30.359
set in the world of celebrity rehab.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.236
Let me guess.

18:32.569 --> 18:35.531
An addiction counselor
turns out to be a celebrity stalker?

18:36.323 --> 18:37.407
Holy shit.

18:38.575 --> 18:41.245
I think you just cracked it.
Are you-- are you a writer?

18:41.495 --> 18:42.621
I'm just a reader.

18:43.163 --> 18:44.414
Speaking of Love...

18:46.542 --> 18:47.793
does she seem off to you?

18:48.502 --> 18:50.254
I think I might have offended her.

18:50.337 --> 18:51.755
I wouldn't sweat it.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.383
She's, like, very wound up lately.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.135
She's always baking.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.137
But like...

18:58.220 --> 18:59.847
who bakes for the baker?

19:01.723 --> 19:02.641
You know?

19:03.308 --> 19:04.685
<i> Your brother's right.</i>

19:05.310 --> 19:08.313
<i>I've been taking your talents</i>
<i>and you for granted.</i>

19:11.316 --> 19:13.402
<i>Maybe in my attempt to give you space,</i>

19:13.861 --> 19:15.863
<i>our friendship's become one-sided.</i>

19:16.572 --> 19:19.074
<i>Maybe I can feed you like you feed me.</i>

19:19.158 --> 19:21.577
Don't walk out on me!
Ellie, stop right there!

19:23.871 --> 19:26.081
Are you or are you not
dicking around with Henderson?

19:26.165 --> 19:28.625
<i>Good, Delilah, set her straight.</i>

19:28.709 --> 19:31.211
Are you or are you not spying on me?

19:31.295 --> 19:33.922
You were at his not-so-secret set.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.382
Not exactly discreet.

19:35.465 --> 19:38.468
-How much did you pay Will to follow me?
-What are you talking about?

19:38.552 --> 19:40.554
The house manager texted me.
She's one of my tipsters.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.848
Listen, Ellie...

19:43.223 --> 19:44.516
Henderson is bad news.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.185
-You need to believe me.
-Why?

19:46.268 --> 19:48.437
I don't even know what happened
between you two

19:48.520 --> 19:50.314
because you won't tell me
anything about it.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.857
Maybe because there's nothing to tell.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.443
You're a walking after school special.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.862
Hey, not everything is a story, okay?

19:56.945 --> 19:59.072
You think everyone is damaged
because you're damaged.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.866
Matter of fact, you love damage so much,

20:00.949 --> 20:02.868
you made it your full-time job,

20:02.951 --> 20:04.119
and it turned you ugly.

20:13.545 --> 20:14.796
Oh, hey.

20:14.880 --> 20:15.756
One,

20:15.839 --> 20:18.342
what the fuck are you doing
creeping around my sister?

20:18.425 --> 20:20.802
Two, why the fuck would you not tell me?

20:20.886 --> 20:22.387
Delilah, I ran into her.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.431
The last thing I wanted was any of this,

20:24.514 --> 20:26.642
but so you know,
I actually <i>did</i> try to talk to her,

20:26.725 --> 20:28.393
and she said-- she said it was harmless.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.562
Oh, okay. Yeah, good neighboring, okay.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.397
Did you reach her little heart

20:32.481 --> 20:33.732
with your little words?

20:33.815 --> 20:35.567
She's 15, Will!

20:35.651 --> 20:38.111
Doesn't matter what she thinks
because the age of consent is 18.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.780
She said it was an internship.

20:40.405 --> 20:41.448
Really.

20:41.531 --> 20:42.658
How can I help?

20:42.741 --> 20:44.284
Just...

20:44.493 --> 20:46.828
stay the hell out of the way
while I take down the bad man.

20:47.579 --> 20:48.455
What are you gonna do?

20:48.747 --> 20:50.415
Same thing Ronan Farrow does,

20:50.499 --> 20:52.834
except faster and with a personal agenda.

20:53.168 --> 20:55.837
It's only a matter of time
before I Harvey the shit out of Henderson.

20:55.921 --> 20:59.800
I have rumors and sources,
and eventually I'm gonna have evidence.

21:01.551 --> 21:04.513
-<i> Her heart's in the right place.</i>

21:04.596 --> 21:08.058
<i>I just wish I could trust Delilah</i>
<i>to protect her little sister.</i>

21:08.392 --> 21:11.645
<i>More to the point,</i>
<i>I wish I could trust Ellie, period.</i>

21:12.980 --> 21:15.649
<i>Full disclosure,</i>
<i>I put some family-friendly spyware</i>

21:15.732 --> 21:18.277
<i>on the new phone I gave her</i>
<i>to protect myself.</i>

21:18.360 --> 21:21.655
<i>Crazy the lengths parents have to go to</i>
<i>to keep an eye on their kids these days.</i>

21:21.738 --> 21:23.657
<i>-Now, it's going to help me...</i>
-It's a new phone.

21:23.740 --> 21:24.825
<i> ...protect her.</i>

21:25.367 --> 21:28.996
<i>I wasn't lying, Love. The last thing</i>
<i>I want to be in is her business.</i>

21:29.079 --> 21:31.915
<i>But I meant it when I said</i>
<i>I'll make myself worthy of you.</i>

21:32.165 --> 21:36.503
<i>That means not turning a blind eye</i>
<i>to obvious cries for help from a child.</i>

21:36.586 --> 21:37.838
<i>Here's what I've learned so far.</i>

21:37.921 --> 21:40.632
<i>Teenagers' inner lives are,</i>
<i>on the outside, boring</i>

21:40.716 --> 21:42.718
<i>and borderline nonsensical.</i>

21:42.801 --> 21:44.177
<i>In Ellie's defense,</i>

21:44.261 --> 21:46.221
<i>she's smarter than her chuckle buddies.</i>

21:46.305 --> 21:48.348
<i>Bottom line, though,</i>
<i>Henderson's correspondence</i>

21:48.432 --> 21:50.726
<i>seems as benign as the others.</i>

21:51.018 --> 21:52.728
<i>She seems to be working for him.</i>

21:53.395 --> 21:55.564
<i>He seems to respect her taste.</i>

21:56.815 --> 21:58.608
<i>And all of their texts are about films,</i>

21:58.734 --> 22:00.485
<i>which brings us to tonight's event:</i>

22:00.569 --> 22:04.364
<i>obscure film screening</i>
<i>with a group of mixed-gender adults.</i>

22:04.448 --> 22:07.492
<i>Not my idea of a good time,</i>
<i>but, I gotta say, harmless.</i>

22:07.784 --> 22:10.495
<i>I think I can stand down,</i>
<i>which is a relief because, frankly,</i>

22:10.954 --> 22:13.373
<i>I've gotta focus</i>
<i>on salvaging our friendship.</i>

22:13.457 --> 22:16.168
<i>Let's face it, me baking for the baker</i>

22:16.251 --> 22:18.211
<i>is a one-way ticket to a kitchen fire.</i>

22:18.295 --> 22:21.340
<i>So I'm getting creative</i>
<i>and I owe my inspiration to your brother.</i>

22:21.423 --> 22:24.176
Love and I
were making our own breakfast

22:24.259 --> 22:26.345
from total junk every morning.

22:28.972 --> 22:31.099
Oh, no.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.018
I stole it from work.

22:33.435 --> 22:34.728
Don't tell my boss.

22:34.811 --> 22:35.645
Okay.

22:38.774 --> 22:39.691
Fancy!

22:41.693 --> 22:43.779
Mm! It smells like absolutely nothing.

22:44.488 --> 22:45.405
Well...

22:46.114 --> 22:48.575
That, my friend, is where you are wrong.

22:50.410 --> 22:51.453
<i>S'il vous plaît.</i>

22:52.329 --> 22:53.372
<i>Merci.</i>

22:53.455 --> 22:54.790
<i>Et voilà!</i>

22:57.000 --> 22:58.210
Chilla Wafers?

22:58.835 --> 23:00.754
I have not had this since I was a kid.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.173
-Forty put you up to this.
-Kind of.

23:03.256 --> 23:06.551
But he neglected to mention
you call them "Chilla Wafers."

23:06.635 --> 23:08.387
Oh, yes. This is an art.

23:08.887 --> 23:11.431
You take the challah,
you soak it in the cocoa,

23:11.515 --> 23:14.309
then you take that wet blob
and you put it between two wafers.

23:14.726 --> 23:16.978
-That sounds delicious.
-Will, it is...

23:17.354 --> 23:19.064
...terrible.

23:19.147 --> 23:20.315
-Like, inedible.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.901
Please don't actually try this.

23:24.319 --> 23:25.904
It's the thought that counts.

23:29.074 --> 23:32.202
And so, uh...

23:33.036 --> 23:34.788
What is this called?

23:34.871 --> 23:37.124
It's breakfast, it's lunch,
sometimes it's dinner.

23:37.207 --> 23:38.625
It was the best I could do as a kid.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.627
Which, you know, well, uh, it's pathetic.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.212
Anyway, try it. Try it.

23:44.631 --> 23:46.633
Uh...

23:47.467 --> 23:48.427
I'm sorry.

23:48.802 --> 23:51.471
I am so sorry.
I did not mean for this to be romantic.

23:53.849 --> 23:54.766
Are you kidding?

23:55.934 --> 23:56.810
I mean, look at this.

24:00.021 --> 24:01.690
Are you a sociopath? I mean--

24:01.773 --> 24:04.985
I told you, I'm-- This is--
I'm trying to not hurt you.

24:05.068 --> 24:07.779
And I told you that's stupid
and giving me zero credit.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.283
Okay, I don't--
I don't care what you think you are,

24:11.366 --> 24:13.160
I care about your actions, what...

24:13.535 --> 24:14.828
what you <i>do.</i>

24:15.370 --> 24:17.706
And these mixed signals, I mean...

24:21.084 --> 24:22.085
peak shitty.

24:34.681 --> 24:36.099
Oh, Love.

24:54.201 --> 24:55.619
I'd like to ask if you're okay,

24:55.702 --> 24:57.537
but I don't wanna be accused
of hitting on you.

24:57.621 --> 24:58.497
What do you care?

24:58.830 --> 25:00.457
I don't want the plants
to be over-watered.

25:04.544 --> 25:06.630
-Ellie, if something happened to you--
-Oh, my God.

25:06.713 --> 25:08.507
Just shut up about Henderson.

25:08.590 --> 25:09.841
It's not his fault, okay?

25:09.925 --> 25:12.344
-What do you mean?
-We were all watching a movie.

25:12.761 --> 25:13.845
There were snacks.

25:14.596 --> 25:15.472
I ate...

25:17.057 --> 25:17.891
something.

25:18.183 --> 25:21.353
Next thing I knew,
I was lying on the balcony.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.480
Henderson was a good guy.

25:24.648 --> 25:26.483
He chewed Jonah out for the edibles

25:26.566 --> 25:28.109
and he even paid for my town car.

25:29.861 --> 25:32.280
Ellie, are you saying you don't remember,
like you lost time?

25:32.364 --> 25:33.281
Don't.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.242
You sound like Delilah.

25:36.618 --> 25:38.245
Shit. You can't tell my sister.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.039
She'll blow things
<i>way </i>out of proportion. Please.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.250
Please don't tell her.

25:46.127 --> 25:47.003
Okay.

25:48.004 --> 25:49.464
I won't tell Delilah.

25:54.928 --> 25:57.764
<i>I'll just have to do</i>
<i>the parenting myself.</i>

26:14.573 --> 26:15.824
Tell me how to hack a celebrity.

26:17.284 --> 26:18.118
I...

26:19.703 --> 26:21.454
require more information.

26:22.330 --> 26:24.916
Henderson. An underage girl.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.084
Probably dozens.

26:26.668 --> 26:27.502
That's all you need.

26:27.877 --> 26:30.797
Okay, but hacking?
What are you looking for?

26:30.880 --> 26:33.216
Evidence he's a pervert,
something that'll take him down.

26:40.890 --> 26:42.601
Are you doing this for the baker?

26:42.851 --> 26:43.852
No.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.562
I'm trying to protect a kid.

26:46.813 --> 26:50.942
No offense, but you don't strike me
as the vigilante type.

26:51.026 --> 26:55.363
Which means you're getting something
out of this other than altruism.

26:55.780 --> 26:56.781
Like...

26:57.157 --> 26:58.199
sense of self-worth?

26:59.075 --> 27:00.577
To prove you're a good person?

27:00.660 --> 27:01.578
Will...

27:01.870 --> 27:03.246
listen to me closely.

27:03.330 --> 27:07.459
If you don't quit the faux shrink bullshit
right now and help me,

27:07.542 --> 27:09.502
I will know you are a bad person,

27:10.045 --> 27:12.714
and I have no trouble
doing bad things to bad people.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.134
I...

27:16.426 --> 27:19.512
bow to your superior self-justification.

27:22.432 --> 27:23.850
I can probably hack the man,

27:23.933 --> 27:26.102
but first I require two things.

27:27.103 --> 27:28.229
One,

27:28.313 --> 27:29.648
the dude's jacktop.

27:30.398 --> 27:33.276
No celeb keeps gross shit
on the cloud or their phone

27:33.360 --> 27:35.654
since Celebgate 2014.

27:36.196 --> 27:38.740
So if he's smart,
he's got a dedicated perv device, hence--

27:38.823 --> 27:40.492
Jacktop, okay.

27:41.284 --> 27:42.243
What's the other thing?

27:42.452 --> 27:43.703
A second laptop.

27:44.412 --> 27:45.246
With WiFi.

27:45.580 --> 27:46.581
Not a chance.

27:47.624 --> 27:49.834
I need to download my tools, man.

27:49.918 --> 27:53.213
Unless you know <i>Python, Perl, Lisp--</i>

27:53.296 --> 27:56.549
There are ten ways you could send
an SOS with one minute of WiFi--

27:56.633 --> 27:58.635
<i>Linux, Nexus, Hashcat...</i>

27:58.718 --> 28:00.470
Or I could teach you how to hack.

28:00.553 --> 28:03.306
By the time we're done,
your victim will be of legal age.

28:12.190 --> 28:14.901
What is going on with you today, huh?
What is this?

28:15.318 --> 28:18.863
Don't blame <i>me.</i> You're the one who has
all the time in the world to work out.

28:18.947 --> 28:20.240
I've been swamped.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.283
I've been managing our parents' store,

28:22.367 --> 28:23.743
rewriting my feature,

28:23.827 --> 28:25.995
and now I'm in development
on <i>False Promises</i> with Will.

28:26.955 --> 28:29.791
It's like Promises in Malibu,

28:29.874 --> 28:31.376
but with fake people.

28:31.710 --> 28:32.544
Yeah.

28:34.129 --> 28:34.963
I get it.

28:35.797 --> 28:38.007
Didn't know you two
were spending so much time together.

28:38.633 --> 28:41.302
Why are you so prickly about Will, huh?

28:42.220 --> 28:43.847
Is something going on?

28:43.930 --> 28:46.057
If something's going on,
you should tell me

28:46.141 --> 28:48.184
because... twinsparency.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.562
You know, it's really funny

28:50.645 --> 28:53.606
how you only seem to care
about twinsparency

28:53.690 --> 28:55.608
when you have <i>nothing </i>going on.

28:56.484 --> 28:58.445
Wow! Wow!

28:58.570 --> 29:00.196
Fuck that. Come on.

29:01.614 --> 29:03.366
You know I'm just trying to protect you.

29:03.825 --> 29:05.785
Why are you all up in my shit today?

29:07.787 --> 29:08.997
Because you're avoiding.

29:10.540 --> 29:14.169
You keep glomming onto people thinking
that's what's gonna make you successful.

29:14.252 --> 29:15.503
Will can't help you.

29:16.337 --> 29:17.505
<i>You </i>need to help you.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.968
Why don't you just do the work?

29:25.430 --> 29:28.933
Or maybe you're threatened
by the possibility

29:29.017 --> 29:32.270
that Will and I could become closer
than you ever could.

29:35.690 --> 29:36.608
Good game.

29:37.025 --> 29:39.027
Yeah, write a script.

29:41.488 --> 29:42.322
Fuck.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.826
<i> The plan: get in Henderson's house,</i>

29:46.910 --> 29:48.495
<i>get jacktop to Will.</i>

29:48.578 --> 29:50.246
<i>Not my first rodeo, thank you, Peach.</i>

29:50.330 --> 29:52.499
<i>But this one's a celebrity.</i>
<i>Finding his place...</i>

29:53.792 --> 29:55.418
<i>Surprisingly easy.</i>

29:55.877 --> 30:00.089
<i>Oh, he bought his historic Hollywood Hills</i>
<i>compound from dear friend Judd off-market.</i>

30:00.173 --> 30:01.508
<i>Address unlisted, of course,</i>

30:01.591 --> 30:05.428
<i>unless you look for Joshua Bunter in LA</i>
<i>voter rolls, which are public record.</i>

30:05.512 --> 30:07.514
<i>Libertarian. Fucking sleazebag.</i>

30:10.308 --> 30:14.103
<i>Henderson's pad,</i>
<i>built in the 20s, four-bed, three-bath,</i>

30:14.187 --> 30:17.190
<i>original tile, shallow-pitched</i>
<i>exposed wood ceilings,</i>

30:17.273 --> 30:19.317
<i>and very high walls.</i>

30:20.568 --> 30:22.111
<i>Scratch breaking and entering.</i>

30:23.947 --> 30:25.281
<i>I need to be invited in.</i>

30:27.200 --> 30:30.912
<i>Which means scoring an invite</i>
<i>to a legendary Henderson party.</i>

30:30.995 --> 30:32.455
<i>VIP only.</i>

30:32.539 --> 30:34.874
<i>It's too bad my dear friend Forty</i>
<i>is non grata.</i>

30:34.958 --> 30:38.419
<i>No, I need to befriend somebody</i>
<i>on the edge of fame.</i>

30:38.503 --> 30:40.672
<i>Henderson's pre-celeb pals.</i>

30:40.755 --> 30:43.675
<i>And what better place to find a nobody</i>
<i>who thinks he's somebody...</i>

30:44.300 --> 30:46.094
<i>than the improv crowd.</i>

30:47.303 --> 30:49.430
<i>Cross-reference Hendy's Insta tags</i>
<i>with Facebook</i>

30:49.514 --> 30:52.225
<i>with people he ats on Twitter</i>
<i>out of his hundred thousand followers,</i>

30:52.308 --> 30:53.226
<i>and you find...</i>

30:53.977 --> 30:54.978
<i>Freddy.</i>

30:56.145 --> 30:57.522
<i>He's my ticket in.</i>

30:58.523 --> 31:01.901
<i>But in order to become an insider</i>
<i>in the cult of improv,</i>

31:01.985 --> 31:03.570
<i>I've got to speak the lingo.</i>

31:03.862 --> 31:05.697
Freddy's whole thing is yes-and.

31:05.780 --> 31:07.115
Only gets you so far.

31:07.198 --> 31:09.576
Then the game of the scene takes over.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.703
<i>God help us.</i>

31:11.786 --> 31:14.163
<i>Scenes are built on agreement.</i>

31:14.247 --> 31:15.331
<i>Someone makes an offer.</i>

31:15.415 --> 31:18.501
Chucky said you want to kiss my peepee
behind the swingset.

31:18.585 --> 31:20.795
<i>No matter what, you say, "Yes, and..."</i>

31:20.879 --> 31:22.881
<i>Yes,</i> I said that.

31:22.964 --> 31:24.048
And...

31:24.132 --> 31:25.633
I want him to watch.

31:25.717 --> 31:29.554
<i>Which is a great way to indoctrinate</i>
<i>female teammates into Hollywood.</i>

31:29.637 --> 31:31.806
<i>You want to be famous? You gotta be game.</i>

31:31.890 --> 31:35.810
<i>Someday, if you're lucky enough,</i>
<i>you can say yes-and to Henderson.</i>

31:36.519 --> 31:38.688
-All right, guys, that's our show.

31:38.771 --> 31:39.939
Thanks for coming.

31:40.356 --> 31:42.150
That was great. Good job.

31:42.233 --> 31:45.069
I'm glad you could see me up there
'cause you could see me in my element.

31:45.153 --> 31:47.864
<i>Nobody advances in this cult</i>
<i>with talent alone,</i>

31:47.947 --> 31:49.741
<i>they climb with heat, connections,</i>

31:49.824 --> 31:52.869
<i>and for that,</i>
<i>I must channel my dear friend Forty.</i>

31:52.952 --> 31:53.953
Hey, Freddy.

31:54.037 --> 31:54.913
Yeah.

31:55.622 --> 31:56.831
-Great show.
-Oh, thanks, man.

31:56.915 --> 31:59.584
-You used to be in <i>WolfJizz,</i> right?
-Oh, yeah, totes.

31:59.667 --> 32:01.502
And that team had instant group mind.

32:02.211 --> 32:04.672
Totes. I saw you at Del Close
a couple years back.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.758
Eugene said you were a must-see.

32:06.841 --> 32:07.884
Oh, you know Eugene?

32:07.967 --> 32:10.845
<i>He's but the tip</i>
<i>of a second-hand bullshit iceberg.</i>

32:10.929 --> 32:12.722
Man, Eugene is the best teacher

32:12.805 --> 32:13.806
I've ever had.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.224
Such strong initiations.

32:15.308 --> 32:17.226
Like, I got to guest spot
a few fuck around shows,

32:17.310 --> 32:20.271
and watching him and Billy
and Henderson mind-meld...

32:21.230 --> 32:22.982
-It's church.
-They're good, yeah.

32:23.066 --> 32:24.943
You know? So I just moved from New York.

32:26.194 --> 32:28.404
You and Hendy
used to be on a Harold team, right?

32:28.488 --> 32:30.114
Oh, Chudthumper?
You know that?

32:30.198 --> 32:32.659
-Yes! Your object work was brilliant.
-That group was crazy.

32:33.242 --> 32:34.410
Oh, thanks, man.

32:35.328 --> 32:39.040
Hey, uh, speaking of Hendy, you know
about the after-show thing at this place?

32:39.123 --> 32:41.334
-No, but it'd be sweet to catch up.
-Yeah, you should come.

32:41.584 --> 32:44.754
Gate code is D-I-C-K-S.

32:44.837 --> 32:46.798
-Classic Henderson, right?
-Classic.

32:46.881 --> 32:48.383
-I'll see you there?
-Yeah.

32:49.092 --> 32:50.301
Chudthumper...

32:51.135 --> 32:53.262
<i> Well, that was only mildly debasing.</i>

32:53.554 --> 32:56.808
<i>Now, all I need</i>
<i>is to slip in and out with a jacktop,</i>

32:56.891 --> 32:59.060
<i>unnoticed in a stream of white guys.</i>

32:59.811 --> 33:02.146
<i>I know, I'm using my privilege for good.</i>

33:03.898 --> 33:04.941
Old sport?

33:05.650 --> 33:07.318
What are you doing here?

33:07.402 --> 33:09.946
<i> No. No way. Did he follow me?</i>

33:10.029 --> 33:11.781
I hit it off with someone at the theater.

33:12.490 --> 33:13.741
Did you and Henderson make up?

33:13.825 --> 33:16.703
Not yet, but I'm seizing the bull.

33:16.786 --> 33:18.121
I'm-- I'm doing the work.

33:18.204 --> 33:21.874
I'm gonna pitch <i>False Promises</i>
live and in the flesh.

33:24.502 --> 33:25.336
So go ahead.

33:25.962 --> 33:28.214
<i> Poor bastard didn't even get</i>
<i>an invite.</i>

33:28.923 --> 33:30.258
<i>So much for unnoticed.</i>

33:32.218 --> 33:35.221
<i>Forgive me, Love,</i>
<i>I've gotta ditch your brother, ASAP.</i>

33:36.639 --> 33:38.641
"Dicks." Classic.

34:00.830 --> 34:03.374
I want to know who from
the Family got cut from the guest list.

34:04.917 --> 34:06.377
Take care. Send me the pic.

34:06.461 --> 34:08.880
See that chick?
That's Henderson's agent.

34:08.963 --> 34:10.715
-I'm gonna find a bathroom.
-Okay.

34:13.259 --> 34:16.512
<i>It's risky to leave Forty</i>
<i>in a force field of anti-sobriety,</i>

34:16.596 --> 34:18.431
<i>but I'm not his babysitter.</i>

34:18.806 --> 34:20.099
<i>I'm here for Ellie.</i>

34:27.899 --> 34:28.816
Tina.

34:30.860 --> 34:31.694
Tina.

34:31.778 --> 34:33.821
Forty. It's been a minute.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.865
Oh, what are you working on these days?

34:35.948 --> 34:36.866
I'm so glad you asked.

34:36.949 --> 34:39.952
I have got this psycho-sexual thriller

34:40.036 --> 34:42.705
set in a, um, a celebrity rehab facility

34:42.789 --> 34:45.124
that I think Henderson
would be perfect for.

34:45.208 --> 34:46.292
It's real, it's fucked up,

34:46.375 --> 34:48.252
-funny, star vehicle--
-Oh, wow. How does it end?

34:49.045 --> 34:51.464
Well, you would need to know
the beginning and the middle...

34:51.547 --> 34:52.840
Wow, sounds promising.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.384
-Yeah, let's set up a meeting and we can--
-No.

34:55.802 --> 34:57.136
Mm-mm. No way.

34:58.304 --> 34:59.555
Why?

34:59.722 --> 35:02.100
Forty, you know when people
talk about having <i>it?</i>

35:02.350 --> 35:03.476
You don't have it.

35:04.185 --> 35:07.146
<i>It </i>is a combination of talent
and work ethic.

35:07.230 --> 35:08.731
And I'm telling you this to help you

35:08.815 --> 35:11.901
because you can have ideas
and nothing to say.

35:12.235 --> 35:14.195
But here's the silver lining:

35:14.278 --> 35:15.363
you're rich.

35:15.446 --> 35:16.948
You don't need to struggle.

35:17.031 --> 35:19.075
You could, like, finance
indie films or something.

35:19.158 --> 35:21.077
You'd be so good. You're so fun.

35:21.202 --> 35:23.329
-Think about it, okay?

35:23.412 --> 35:26.290
I love you.
I'm trying to protect you. Mwah!

35:26.374 --> 35:27.583
Mm-hmm.

35:34.340 --> 35:36.050
<i>Henderson's inner sanctum.</i>

35:36.134 --> 35:38.636
<i>It's so... normal.</i>

35:39.637 --> 35:44.142
<i>It's a certain kind of assault,</i>
<i>but bad taste does not a predator make.</i>

35:44.559 --> 35:47.311
<i>I wonder how many people Josh alienated</i>

35:47.395 --> 35:49.814
<i>as he climbed the mountain</i>
<i>to become Henderson.</i>

35:50.648 --> 35:54.402
<i>And how many girls Henderson traumatized</i>
<i>once he had all the power.</i>

36:04.495 --> 36:06.080
<i> It's Chekhov's knife.</i>

36:06.164 --> 36:07.915
And as soon as we see it,

36:07.999 --> 36:10.376
then you know throats are gonna get cut.

36:10.459 --> 36:14.046
But we don't know whose,
and we don't know why.

36:14.589 --> 36:18.217
Sure, she's--
she's cutting an apple right now,

36:18.301 --> 36:22.847
but the audience
is gonna be subconsciously terrified...

36:22.930 --> 36:24.056
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

36:24.140 --> 36:26.642
...for the human apple.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.019
It's powerful, man.

36:28.144 --> 36:28.978
Old sport!

36:29.395 --> 36:32.940
I am pitching <i>False Promises</i>

36:33.024 --> 36:35.359
to these fine fuckers,

36:35.443 --> 36:37.111
and I'm on page six,

36:37.862 --> 36:40.156
which now that I'm saying it out loud,

36:40.239 --> 36:41.699
feels like page three.

36:42.325 --> 36:43.993
<i> I should leave, I should just leave,</i>

36:44.076 --> 36:46.662
<i>go help Ellie, let Forty screw Forty.</i>

36:59.008 --> 37:00.843
Sport? Sport.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.180
Forty, hey...

37:04.263 --> 37:06.599
Forty, your sister's asking for you.
Let's get out of here.

37:06.682 --> 37:07.808
No.

37:08.184 --> 37:09.227
Boo-oo!

37:09.352 --> 37:10.519
Party foul!

37:10.770 --> 37:12.730
Tell her-- tell her I'm mid-pitch.

37:12.813 --> 37:14.857
I'm <i>en fuego.</i> She'll get it.

37:14.941 --> 37:15.858
Forty!

37:15.942 --> 37:19.195
Please, let me take you home. Come on.
You don't want her to see you like this.

37:19.445 --> 37:22.156
- Yo, Captain Buzzkill!
-Why not?

37:22.490 --> 37:25.159
This is exactly...

37:25.701 --> 37:27.787
what she expects, promise.

37:28.454 --> 37:31.791
Do you have any idea how painful it is

37:31.874 --> 37:34.502
disappointing someone who is that perfect?

37:35.294 --> 37:36.921
You would be surprised.

37:38.965 --> 37:39.966
Hey, you know what?

37:40.049 --> 37:42.385
You need to be drinking that swill
if you're doing blow.

37:42.468 --> 37:44.971
-Get down. Hey, easy, easy.
- Henderson, Henderson.

37:45.054 --> 37:48.808
-Yeah, no, I have a pitch for you.
-We got a lot of catching up to do, buddy.

37:48.891 --> 37:51.477
All right? But let's just, uh,
not mix business with pleasure.

37:51.560 --> 37:54.438
Let's just call Tina and we'll set up
a meet with the both of us.

37:54.522 --> 37:56.274
<i> Henderson's trying to help.</i>

37:56.357 --> 37:58.943
-No, I'm-- I'm good. Let's talk.
-No, no, I know you're good.

37:59.026 --> 38:00.778
As a matter of fact,
I'm the one that's tired.

38:00.861 --> 38:03.781
Actually... Everybody, guys,
I'm tired, so...

38:05.283 --> 38:07.660
All right, whatever.
Fuck you, young people.

38:07.743 --> 38:11.163
I'm in my 30s, I'm down a nut,
and I need my eight hours, so good night!

38:11.372 --> 38:13.499
<i> Did this guy just tank his own party</i>

38:13.582 --> 38:15.668
<i>to make Forty feel better about leaving?</i>

38:15.751 --> 38:18.546
-Oh, Henderson, man, I owe you an apology.
-No, shh.

38:18.629 --> 38:21.590
-I'm really sorry.
-Hey, hey, hey. You're a delicious prince.

38:21.674 --> 38:22.508
Okay?

38:22.842 --> 38:23.843
Get home safe.

38:23.926 --> 38:25.303
Bygones are bygones.

38:26.345 --> 38:27.972
Here, I'll get you to Love's, okay?

38:28.055 --> 38:30.182
No, no! No, please, please.

38:30.266 --> 38:33.519
I don't-- I don't want to go to somewhere
funded by Quinn blood money.

38:33.602 --> 38:35.479
Don't-- don't you get the curse yet?

38:35.563 --> 38:36.981
Okay, okay, then we'll go to mine.

38:37.064 --> 38:37.982
-Okay.
-All right?

38:40.026 --> 38:41.193
Hey, buddy, do I know you?

38:44.697 --> 38:47.408
Will. We, uh-- we met at a party, Valley.

38:47.658 --> 38:50.244
-Oh, the finger guy, right? Yeah.
-Yes.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.371
You're Delilah's friend.
So you know Ellie.

38:52.788 --> 38:53.664
Yes.

38:54.457 --> 38:55.374
And...

38:55.833 --> 38:57.209
she's very smart.

38:57.293 --> 38:58.836
Did you just yes-and my small talk?

38:59.128 --> 39:01.380
Yes, and I regret it.

39:01.464 --> 39:03.299
Hey, keep practicing.
That was really good.

39:04.216 --> 39:07.345
She-- Ellie is--
Is she your intern or...?

39:08.095 --> 39:10.348
Yeah, that kid is so, so smart.

39:10.806 --> 39:13.351
Ah, it's the least a privileged
white male asshole can do.

39:28.574 --> 39:29.408
Hey.

39:30.117 --> 39:31.952
-What did he take?
-No idea.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.371
It happened so fast.

39:33.454 --> 39:34.872
I'm sorry.

39:34.955 --> 39:35.831
I'm really sorry.

39:35.915 --> 39:37.124
What did you take?

39:39.794 --> 39:41.170
Would you mind putting on some tea?

39:43.255 --> 39:44.423
I'm sorry.

39:58.729 --> 39:59.563
There you go.

40:02.525 --> 40:03.984
Do you think I'm talented?

40:05.486 --> 40:06.445
Of course I do.

40:08.114 --> 40:10.157
-That's why I push you.
-But...

40:10.783 --> 40:11.909
do I have to, like...

40:12.868 --> 40:15.746
live in a shitbox like this
to be a real artist?

40:15.830 --> 40:16.705
Like...

40:17.498 --> 40:19.083
where even are we?

40:19.667 --> 40:20.501
Hey.

40:21.752 --> 40:22.795
You're with me.

40:23.337 --> 40:24.505
Always will be.

40:26.006 --> 40:28.717
And that's all that matters.

40:29.468 --> 40:30.553
What's the point?

40:32.346 --> 40:35.558
Even if I made something really good now,

40:35.975 --> 40:37.685
nobody is gonna care about it.

40:37.768 --> 40:38.853
That's not true.

40:39.478 --> 40:42.273
Whatever you write, I can't wait...

40:43.065 --> 40:43.899
to read it

40:44.191 --> 40:45.818
'cause it's gonna come from you.

41:34.533 --> 41:36.952
I'm sorry I didn't look after
your brother tonight.

41:38.704 --> 41:39.788
It's not your job.

41:41.457 --> 41:42.374
It's mine.

41:44.960 --> 41:46.253
And Forty's fragile.

41:49.215 --> 41:52.134
Life just keeps kicking the shit
out of him.

41:53.719 --> 41:55.429
Always has since we were kids.

41:56.639 --> 41:59.517
Everybody sees the money.
They don't understand he never...

42:03.103 --> 42:04.522
He never had a chance.

42:06.357 --> 42:09.693
Oh, when he was little, he was confident.

42:11.779 --> 42:12.905
Creative.

42:14.073 --> 42:15.533
<i>So </i>sweet.

42:17.826 --> 42:19.495
Then, this one summer...

42:22.831 --> 42:24.708
the year my parents launched Anavrin,

42:24.792 --> 42:26.252
they left us with this...

42:26.794 --> 42:29.797
fucking crazy <i>au pair.</i>

42:30.506 --> 42:32.633
Forty saw way too much, too young.

42:33.342 --> 42:35.511
Now I'm the one
who picks up the pieces because...

42:36.178 --> 42:37.596
he needs someone.

42:40.641 --> 42:42.142
He's a good person.

42:42.685 --> 42:44.979
He just does some bad things sometimes.

42:45.896 --> 42:46.897
I'm sorry.

42:47.731 --> 42:48.566
That's hard.

42:48.816 --> 42:49.900
But that's love.

42:52.820 --> 42:54.488
See, this is what I'm talking about.

42:56.282 --> 42:58.367
I'm not perfect either.

43:00.327 --> 43:01.579
Codependent brother...

43:02.788 --> 43:03.664
A widow...

43:06.333 --> 43:08.294
You haven't even met my parents yet.

43:11.505 --> 43:12.840
You deserve better...

43:14.300 --> 43:16.385
than <i>another </i>broken soul.

43:17.011 --> 43:18.387
We're all a little broken.

43:22.433 --> 43:24.643
Yet some pieces still manage
to fit together.

43:58.052 --> 43:59.637
-Shh! He's sleeping.

44:19.573 --> 44:20.532
I told you.

44:20.824 --> 44:22.368
We have to be quiet.

45:07.705 --> 45:10.165
<i> You're a different kind of</i>
<i>woman, Love.</i>

45:13.293 --> 45:15.754
<i>This time will be different.</i>

45:19.007 --> 45:20.384
<i>I will never hurt you.</i>

45:20.467 --> 45:22.344
<i>If anything, we can heal each other,</i>

45:22.428 --> 45:26.306
<i>and I promise, I'll never take</i>
<i>your cooking for granted again.</i>

45:29.268 --> 45:30.644
Morning, old sport.

45:31.103 --> 45:32.479
How do you like your eggs?

45:32.980 --> 45:34.189
Sunny side up.

45:34.523 --> 45:37.526
<i> And I will try my hardest to accept</i>

45:37.609 --> 45:40.028
<i>being in a damn throuple</i>
<i>with your brother.</i>

45:51.749 --> 45:53.500
How much longer?

45:53.584 --> 45:55.335
Ask the shitty burner you bought.

45:59.673 --> 46:01.091
Well, good news,

46:01.175 --> 46:02.468
dude was easy to crack.

46:02.885 --> 46:05.179
The bad news, the dude was clean.

46:05.929 --> 46:06.930
It's impossible.

46:07.890 --> 46:10.684
I scrubbed all his files, accounts,

46:10.768 --> 46:12.561
search history, Pornhub.

46:13.979 --> 46:15.731
<i> Well, I did my job.</i>

46:16.356 --> 46:18.400
<i>If I'm willing to put my faith in Love,</i>

46:18.942 --> 46:20.861
<i>then maybe Ellie deserves the same trust.</i>

46:21.528 --> 46:22.738
<i>She's smart.</i>

46:22.821 --> 46:23.781
How you feeling?

46:26.033 --> 46:27.367
Embarrassed.

46:27.451 --> 46:30.746
Hey, I'm really sorry
I puked in such close proximity to you.

46:30.829 --> 46:32.206
-Ah...
-It was a bad edible.

46:32.289 --> 46:33.248
So gross.

46:36.084 --> 46:38.170
Thanks for not narcing me out.

46:38.253 --> 46:39.338
It's on your list.

46:39.922 --> 46:41.924
A bookseller gets murdered
in the first 20 minutes,

46:42.007 --> 46:44.635
so, uh... if it's too much for you,
I'll understand.

46:45.928 --> 46:47.638
All right, gotta get to Hendy's.

46:49.598 --> 46:51.225
The hustle never stops, William.

46:51.308 --> 46:53.560
You're gonna come home
to the first book on your list.

46:53.644 --> 46:55.562
-It's a hardcover.
-I'm already bored.

47:01.902 --> 47:04.071
<i> For Ellie, something dark,</i>

47:04.154 --> 47:05.823
<i>funny, ambitious,</i>

47:05.906 --> 47:08.742
<i>a break from the dreck</i>
<i>that crosses Henderson's desk.</i>

47:09.993 --> 47:11.119
Bettelheim.

47:11.578 --> 47:14.790
-<i> Oh, speaking of.</i>
-So here is the crusher.

47:15.582 --> 47:16.792
I have been...

47:17.459 --> 47:18.502
giving it some thought,

47:18.585 --> 47:21.505
and I don't think <i>False Promises</i>
is gonna happen.

47:22.130 --> 47:24.341
It's a short story, not a feature film.

47:24.883 --> 47:26.969
Oh, I'm sorry. That's a real shame.

47:27.052 --> 47:29.513
It's okay.
We'll think of something better, right?

47:29.596 --> 47:31.807
A real showcase for Henderson.

47:32.140 --> 47:34.518
My lunch with him
is still on the books for next week, so...

47:38.188 --> 47:39.064
That's great.

47:39.606 --> 47:40.440
Hey, can I ask?

47:41.525 --> 47:43.193
What happened between you two?

47:43.277 --> 47:47.781
You know, I don't actually remember
much of the night in question.

47:47.865 --> 47:52.035
I mean, there was not much at that party
that wasn't in my system.

47:53.453 --> 47:56.665
It was all gonna...
come up eventually, right?

47:57.291 --> 47:59.626
Just wish it hadn't been
all over his secret toy room.

48:01.503 --> 48:03.589
-Secret toy room?
-Yeah.

48:03.672 --> 48:05.841
It's one of those old Prohibition houses

48:05.924 --> 48:08.343
with the hidden speakeasy doors.

Henderson has transformed it
into this whimsical little...

48:12.598 --> 48:14.474
creepy dungeon, I guess.

48:14.558 --> 48:17.519
And I went full <i>Exorcist </i>on that shit,
just like...

48:19.563 --> 48:20.814
You said it's creepy.

48:21.857 --> 48:24.568
Imagine if you collected kids' stuff,

48:24.651 --> 48:30.115
yet also were low-key
a bit of a fucking sadist in the sack.

48:31.199 --> 48:33.160
-That.
-<i> A secret room.</i>

48:33.243 --> 48:34.244
Huh.

48:35.203 --> 48:36.788
I'm disappointed I missed <i>that.</i>
