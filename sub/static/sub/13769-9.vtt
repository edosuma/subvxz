00:03.086 --> 00:04.254
(chuckles)

00:04.296 --> 00:05.547
Check this out.

00:05.589 --> 00:07.048
What does it say?

00:07.090 --> 00:08.049
Just read it.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.049
It's funny.

00:08.091 --> 00:09.551
I don't read.

00:09.593 --> 00:11.553
Not unless I absolutely

00:09.593 --> 00:11.553
have to for school.

00:11.595 --> 00:13.681
Otherwise, I feel

00:11.595 --> 00:13.681
like they've won.

00:13.722 --> 00:15.641
You never read the paper?

00:15.683 --> 00:17.058
No.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.268
Not even comics?

00:18.310 --> 00:19.520
Like Peanuts?

00:19.561 --> 00:20.896
You never read Peanuts?

00:20.938 --> 00:21.856
Nope.

00:21.897 --> 00:23.064
Are you serious?

00:23.106 --> 00:24.775
You've never read Peanuts?

00:24.817 --> 00:27.068
Uh-uh.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.075
Go ahead.

00:34.117 --> 00:36.119
I promise I'll hold it.

LOIS: Malcolm, I said

01:15.534 --> 01:18.996
come in for breakfast!

01:22.165 --> 01:23.792
Francis and Piama came to visit

01:23.834 --> 01:25.586
at the same time

01:23.834 --> 01:25.586
Grandma was here.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.713
Eight people,

01:25.627 --> 01:27.713
seven sleeping spaces.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.130
Guess who gets the shaft.

01:29.172 --> 01:31.174
This is my reward

01:29.172 --> 01:31.174
for being at the library

01:31.216 --> 01:33.134
when they asked for a volunteer.

01:33.176 --> 01:36.055
LOIS: Malcolm, this is

01:33.176 --> 01:36.055
your last chance!

01:36.095 --> 01:37.556
I got to get in there.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.225
Breakfast has turned

01:37.598 --> 01:40.225
into the best part of the day.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.143
I can't believe

01:40.267 --> 01:42.143
what I'm hearing!

01:42.185 --> 01:43.812
Are you insane or just evil?

01:43.854 --> 01:46.523
(thick accent): Aah! Wolves

01:43.854 --> 01:46.523
should rip out your throat!

01:46.565 --> 01:49.526
What kind of a complete idiot

01:46.565 --> 01:49.526
butters their toast like that?!

01:49.568 --> 01:50.945
Everybody knows

01:50.986 --> 01:52.404
it's inside to outside!

01:52.446 --> 01:54.073
Come talk to me of toast

01:54.114 --> 01:56.241
when you grow some hair

01:54.114 --> 01:56.241
in your pants.

01:56.283 --> 01:59.160
Stupid animal thinks he knows

01:56.283 --> 01:59.160
about toast.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.371
Mom, would you please

01:59.202 --> 02:01.371
pass the potatoes?

02:01.413 --> 02:03.791
I think you've had

02:01.413 --> 02:03.791
more than enough potatoes.

02:03.832 --> 02:04.875
Does the chair have

02:04.917 --> 02:06.585
to break

02:04.917 --> 02:06.585
before you stop eating?

02:08.087 --> 02:10.171
I told you my family was

02:08.087 --> 02:10.171
worse than your family.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.465
Are you kidding?

02:11.506 --> 02:13.675
My grandpa chopped the pinky

02:11.506 --> 02:13.675
off our milkman

02:13.717 --> 02:15.176
for bringing us two percent.

02:15.218 --> 02:17.972
Hey! Mom, Grandma just

02:15.218 --> 02:17.972
stole my bacon.

02:18.013 --> 02:20.099
Reese, this is

02:18.013 --> 02:20.099
Grandma's last day here.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.476
If she wants your bacon,

02:20.140 --> 02:22.476
you let her have it.

02:22.517 --> 02:23.435
Crybaby.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.104
Okay, Ida,

02:25.145 --> 02:26.605
I went ahead and did

02:25.145 --> 02:26.605
all your packing for you.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.856
Let's get a move on.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.566
Bus doesn't leave

02:27.898 --> 02:29.566
for three hours.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.610
Yeah, but, uh,

02:29.608 --> 02:31.610
there could be a parade.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.279
It could take us all day

02:31.652 --> 02:34.279
to get through the traffic.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.990
Oh, great.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.282
There's barely

02:36.031 --> 02:37.282
any food left.

02:37.324 --> 02:40.160
Well, you should have come

02:37.324 --> 02:40.160
when I called you.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.667
Call when you get home, Mom.

02:46.708 --> 02:47.876
We'll miss you.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.586
Even the little

02:47.918 --> 02:49.586
one lies.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.421
Reese, I asked you

02:49.628 --> 02:51.421
to rake these leaves.

02:51.463 --> 02:53.882
I'm waiting for the rest

02:51.463 --> 02:53.882
of them to fall first.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.258
Let's not delay Grandma

02:55.300 --> 02:57.218
by having this needless

02:55.300 --> 02:57.218
discussion, shall we?

02:57.260 --> 02:58.261
Oh, sure.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.472
Can't wait to get me

02:58.303 --> 03:00.472
out your door.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.224
Forcing an old woman

03:00.514 --> 03:03.224
on the...

03:03.266 --> 03:07.062
(screaming)

03:09.940 --> 03:12.109
(slow motion):

03:09.940 --> 03:12.109
Mom!

03:16.195 --> 03:18.657
(groaning)

03:32.462 --> 03:33.922
Grandma's back.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.757
Mom wants you

03:33.964 --> 03:35.757
to help her unpack.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.634
This is unbelievable.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.634
It's all Reese's fault.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.887
If he had just cleaned up the

03:37.676 --> 03:39.887
yard like he was supposed to,

03:39.928 --> 03:41.262
none of this would

03:39.928 --> 03:41.262
have happened.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.515
Malcolm, she slipped on a leaf.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.851
A tiny, single leaf.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.851
(sprinklers turn on)

03:45.893 --> 03:47.144
I wouldn't be surprised

03:47.186 --> 03:48.937
if she broke her collarbone

03:47.186 --> 03:48.937
on purpose

03:48.979 --> 03:51.065
just so she could stay here

03:48.979 --> 03:51.065
and torment us.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.440
And I'm the one who suffers.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.651
I was so close to sleeping

03:52.482 --> 03:54.651
in the house again.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.904
I forget what a bed feels like.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.279
What are you complaining about?

03:58.321 --> 04:00.281
I'm the one who had to carry her

03:58.321 --> 04:00.281
to the car

04:00.323 --> 04:02.117
with her dress hiked up

04:00.323 --> 04:02.117
over her hips.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.119
I went blind

04:02.159 --> 04:04.119
for almost 15 minutes.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.122
(door opens)

04:08.498 --> 04:10.500
Oh, it's just you.

04:10.542 --> 04:11.501
What are you doing?

04:11.543 --> 04:12.502
Everyone's blaming me

04:12.544 --> 04:14.171
for Grandma getting hurt,

04:14.213 --> 04:15.589
and I got an idea for

04:14.213 --> 04:15.589
how to cheer everyone up.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.508
What are you going to do?

04:15.630 --> 04:18.508
I don't know if

04:15.630 --> 04:18.508
I can trust you.

04:18.550 --> 04:19.676
Come on, you can.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.302
Hmm.

04:21.344 --> 04:22.679
Tell you what.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.305
Punch yourself

04:22.721 --> 04:24.305
in the face.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.349
(sighs)

04:28.936 --> 04:30.145
Okay, you're in.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.521
First thing you can do

04:30.187 --> 04:31.521
is show me

04:31.563 --> 04:33.774
how to turn this thing on.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.696
Your fingers are too fat.

04:39.738 --> 04:41.907
Who has fingers

04:39.738 --> 04:41.907
like that?

04:41.949 --> 04:44.325
I'm losing my appetite

04:41.949 --> 04:44.325
just looking at them.

04:44.367 --> 04:45.744
She can feed

04:44.367 --> 04:45.744
herself, Lois.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.204
I didn't ask for this.

04:47.246 --> 04:48.329
This is your fault.

04:48.371 --> 04:49.330
You keep your yard

04:49.372 --> 04:50.498
like a jungle.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.708
And steps.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.334
Who builds a house with steps?

04:53.376 --> 04:55.754
You think you're better

04:53.376 --> 04:55.754
than everybody else?

04:55.796 --> 04:57.131
Well?

04:57.172 --> 04:58.632
My family's still worse.

04:58.673 --> 05:02.510
My mom faked stomach cancer

04:58.673 --> 05:02.510
so she wouldn't get custody.

05:02.552 --> 05:03.720
There's time.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.346
Just use your tongue

05:03.762 --> 05:05.346
as leverage.

05:05.388 --> 05:06.140
Enough!

05:06.181 --> 05:07.348
I had better food

05:07.390 --> 05:08.725
in refugee camp.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.145
Boy, everyone's in

05:08.767 --> 05:11.145
such a crappy mood.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.562
It's awful.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.564
If only there was some

05:12.604 --> 05:14.564
way to cheer everyone up.

05:14.606 --> 05:15.565
Be cool.

05:15.607 --> 05:16.566
(doorbell rings)

05:16.608 --> 05:17.525
I'll get it.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.526
It's for me.

05:18.568 --> 05:19.987
Here, Mom,

05:18.568 --> 05:19.987
let me help you.

05:22.281 --> 05:23.531
You're eating dinner?

05:23.573 --> 05:25.200
Nobody even called me!

05:25.242 --> 05:26.576
What happened

05:25.242 --> 05:26.576
to your face?

05:26.618 --> 05:28.203
An owl flew into my tent.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.871
If I knew I was missing dinner,

05:29.913 --> 05:32.207
I would have grabbed the snake

05:29.913 --> 05:32.207
out of his beak.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.376
Yes?

05:35.418 --> 05:37.171
Is this 1233...

05:37.212 --> 05:38.463
Go ahead. This is her.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.799
You've been served.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.177
What are you waiting for,

05:41.842 --> 05:43.177
a tip?

05:43.218 --> 05:45.344
Get out of here!

05:46.429 --> 05:48.682
You're suing us?

05:48.723 --> 05:51.310
Okay, you win.

06:00.443 --> 06:01.402
You're suing us?!

06:01.444 --> 06:02.403
Hal, keep it down.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.571
The boys are in the house.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.073
Don't be so dramatic.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.825
I am suing insurance company.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.576
Our  insurance

06:06.867 --> 06:08.576
company!

06:08.618 --> 06:10.411
You don't think I have a case?

06:10.453 --> 06:11.872
You don't think I have pain?

06:11.913 --> 06:13.414
That I have suffered?

06:13.456 --> 06:15.792
For years, I have suffered

06:13.456 --> 06:15.792
in silence.

06:15.834 --> 06:18.503
Useless, miserable,

06:15.834 --> 06:18.503
money-grubbing old hag!

06:18.545 --> 06:20.214
Keep talking tough, boy.

06:20.255 --> 06:21.422
I sue you, too.

06:21.464 --> 06:22.841
All right,

06:21.464 --> 06:22.841
everybody just calm down.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.093
Mother, please,

06:22.883 --> 06:25.093
think about what you're doing.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.427
You are suing your own child.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.263
I don't want to talk

06:26.469 --> 06:28.263
about it anymore.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.430
Let the lawyers handle it.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.515
Lawyer?!

06:30.557 --> 06:31.683
We don't have a lawyer.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.935
Well, you better get one.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.813
She can't get

06:34.978 --> 06:36.813
away with this!

06:36.855 --> 06:38.148
I've had it!

06:38.190 --> 06:39.482
I'm going to toss her out

06:38.190 --> 06:39.482
on her cage.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.151
Hal, we can't do that.

06:41.193 --> 06:42.319
She's my mother.

06:42.361 --> 06:43.444
(sighs)

06:43.486 --> 06:45.739
My twisted, horrible

06:43.486 --> 06:45.739
monster of a mother.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.532
Why don't we just

06:45.780 --> 06:47.532
kill the old hag?

06:47.574 --> 06:49.076
Oh, just stop it right now.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.452
And nobody tells the boys

06:49.117 --> 06:51.452
about any of this.

06:51.494 --> 06:52.829
You mean about killing her?

06:52.871 --> 06:54.164
No, Hal.

06:54.206 --> 06:55.456
About the lawsuit.

06:55.498 --> 06:56.875
Oh.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.459
I think I'm going to be sick.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.459
I know.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.461
I feel the same way.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.461
No, I really think

07:00.503 --> 07:01.588
I'm going to throw up.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.259
MAN:

07:04.174 --> 07:05.259
Well,

07:05.300 --> 07:06.551
I think I figured out

07:06.593 --> 07:09.263
why you're feeling so lousy,

07:06.593 --> 07:09.263
Lois.

07:09.304 --> 07:11.598
You're pregnant.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.899
Pregnant?

07:20.941 --> 07:23.443
Congratulations.

07:24.236 --> 07:26.321
(laughs)

07:26.363 --> 07:28.489
This is the best part

07:26.363 --> 07:28.489
of my job.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.284
Seeing the looks

07:28.531 --> 07:30.284
on people's faces

07:30.325 --> 07:32.452
when I give them the good news.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.081
This is...

07:36.123 --> 07:38.458
fantastic.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.086
Thank you so much, Doctor.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.545
Now, you're 100% sure?

07:42.587 --> 07:46.007
Because it would be terrible

07:42.587 --> 07:46.007
if you were somehow wrong.

07:46.049 --> 07:48.427
Like, maybe my chart got

07:46.049 --> 07:48.427
mixed up with someone else's?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.011
No. It's your chart.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.805
I promise.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.307
Could you just...

07:53.348 --> 07:55.350
make our happiness complete

07:53.348 --> 07:55.350
and-and...

07:55.392 --> 07:57.311
and check again?

07:57.352 --> 07:59.354
Yes. Take as much blood

07:57.352 --> 07:59.354
as you need.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.356
Just be certain.

08:01.398 --> 08:04.109
We wouldn't want you

08:01.398 --> 08:04.109
to take our dream away.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.360
Relax.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.527
I am absolutely sure.

08:06.569 --> 08:09.072
Congratulations.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.033
(door closes)

08:12.075 --> 08:13.701
Oh, my God,

08:12.075 --> 08:13.701
this is awful!

08:13.743 --> 08:15.829
(sobbing)

08:15.870 --> 08:17.038
This can't be right.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.539
This must be

08:17.080 --> 08:18.539
some sort of mistake.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.000
What are we going to do?

08:20.041 --> 08:22.169
I don't know. We can't

08:20.041 --> 08:22.169
afford the children we have!

08:22.210 --> 08:23.544
If this baby is half as bad

08:23.586 --> 08:25.130
as our least bad one,

08:23.586 --> 08:25.130
we're still ruined.

08:25.172 --> 08:28.216
Oh, this has got to be

08:25.172 --> 08:28.216
some kind of cruel joke!

08:28.258 --> 08:31.219
Terrible. Just terrible.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.720
Are you as turned on as I am?

08:32.762 --> 08:34.055
Hal!

08:35.640 --> 08:37.558
(TV playing)

08:37.600 --> 08:41.313
GRANDMA:

08:37.600 --> 08:41.313
I'm done with my business.

08:43.898 --> 08:45.150
You can't fool me.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.776
I know you're out there.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.028
(sighs)

08:48.069 --> 08:49.363
Okay, whose turn is it?

08:49.404 --> 08:51.531
She's not my grandma.

08:52.615 --> 08:53.992
Okay, I'm thinking of a number.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.369
MALCOLM:

08:54.034 --> 08:55.369
Wait a minute.

08:55.410 --> 08:56.577
You're just

08:55.410 --> 08:56.577
writing down the number

08:56.619 --> 08:57.578
so you can't be the one.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.872
One. That's it. You're up.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.581
Enjoy.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.581
Go ahead, Malcolm.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.292
This is so unfair!

09:02.334 --> 09:04.503
I don't even live here.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.922
GRANDMA: The longer you wait,

09:04.544 --> 09:07.922
the worse it'll be!

09:11.801 --> 09:14.429
I hate you all.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.644
You know,

09:19.559 --> 09:21.644
my parents don't come home

09:21.686 --> 09:23.480
for another half an hour.

09:23.522 --> 09:24.856
You're dreaming.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.108
Come on! I'm going crazy.

09:28.651 --> 09:29.903
Okay.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.239
Hey, guys,

09:29.944 --> 09:32.239
I'm going to go show Piama

09:32.280 --> 09:34.282
the... posters in your room

09:32.280 --> 09:34.282
for a while.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.492
Have fun.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.492
Good idea.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.619
(sighs)

09:38.661 --> 09:39.787
I thought they'd never leave.

09:39.829 --> 09:40.872
Tell me about it.

09:40.914 --> 09:41.915
Okay, it's still good.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.625
I'll get the gift wrap.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.836
You write the card.

09:49.464 --> 09:50.631
There's no lock?

09:50.673 --> 09:52.050
With my brothers?

09:52.092 --> 09:53.843
They just got the door back

09:52.092 --> 09:53.843
a few months ago.

09:56.513 --> 09:57.889
I don't know, Francis.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.057
This feels weird.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.725
In your brothers' bedroom.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.143
No. This room is fine.

10:02.185 --> 10:03.353
I've had plenty

10:02.185 --> 10:03.353
of girls in here...

10:03.395 --> 10:05.688
Quit while you're ahead.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.488
GRANDMA:

10:12.362 --> 10:13.488
That's good enough.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.532
No one's going

10:13.530 --> 10:15.532
to eat off it.

10:15.574 --> 10:18.159
Okay, maybe

10:15.574 --> 10:18.159
not in here.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.626
(laughs)

10:30.505 --> 10:32.382
Mom...

10:32.424 --> 10:33.508
we need to talk.

10:33.550 --> 10:34.926
Um...

10:34.968 --> 10:37.137
we just got some interesting

10:34.968 --> 10:37.137
news from the doctor.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.598
HAL: Yes. It's, uh,

10:37.178 --> 10:39.598
very good news.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.099
Well, kind of good news.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.351
It's extreme news.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.646
I'm pregnant.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.566
You're joking.

10:49.608 --> 10:51.692
Believe me, we were

10:49.608 --> 10:51.692
as surprised as...

10:51.734 --> 10:52.902
as you are.

10:52.944 --> 10:54.613
Um, you know,

10:54.654 --> 10:56.906
we're already stretched

10:54.654 --> 10:56.906
to the limit financially.

10:56.948 --> 10:59.200
And, obviously,

10:56.948 --> 10:59.200
another baby is going

10:59.242 --> 11:01.411
to make things even

10:59.242 --> 11:01.411
harder for us.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.580
HAL: Yeah, so in

11:01.453 --> 11:03.580
light of that

11:03.622 --> 11:05.415
and the burden

11:03.622 --> 11:05.415
it's going to put on us,

11:05.457 --> 11:08.293
don't you think that certain

11:05.457 --> 11:08.293
actions should be reexamined?

11:08.335 --> 11:10.003
Yes. Yes, of course.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.712
(both panting)

11:11.754 --> 11:12.797
You should settle.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.715
What?!

11:14.757 --> 11:16.426
Mom!

11:16.468 --> 11:17.802
It's for your own good.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.762
If you can't keep your legs

11:17.844 --> 11:19.762
closed for 20 minutes,

11:19.804 --> 11:22.349
at least take good advice

11:19.804 --> 11:22.349
when you hear it.

11:25.268 --> 11:28.438
Sleeping is the only thing

11:25.268 --> 11:28.438
that makes my life worthwhile.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.315
I can dream

11:28.480 --> 11:30.315
I'm somewhere decent.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.193
Hey, Malcolm,

11:30.357 --> 11:33.193
we need to borrow the tent

11:33.234 --> 11:34.735
for about an hour.

11:34.777 --> 11:35.820
Two hours.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.155
What? Why?

11:37.197 --> 11:38.739
None of your business.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.739
We just need it.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.617
No. It's bad enough I've been

11:38.781 --> 11:40.617
kicked out of the house.

11:40.659 --> 11:42.202
Now you want to take

11:40.659 --> 11:42.202
away the one place I have

11:42.243 --> 11:43.370
with just the tiniest

11:42.243 --> 11:43.370
piece of privacy?

11:43.411 --> 11:44.912
Forget it.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.912
Find your...

11:44.954 --> 11:46.331
Ow!

11:46.373 --> 11:47.541
Thanks, really.

11:47.582 --> 11:49.417
I hope you're happy.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.751
Forcing your

11:49.459 --> 11:50.751
own brother

11:50.793 --> 11:52.462
out into the night

11:50.793 --> 11:52.462
in his underwear.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.713
We're going to need that.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.759
What are we going to do?

11:58.801 --> 12:00.761
We're in debt

11:58.801 --> 12:00.761
up to our eyeballs as it is.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.264
Well, we're just going

12:00.803 --> 12:03.264
to have to cut back.

12:03.306 --> 12:04.765
No more vacations.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.060
Stop going out to fancy

12:04.807 --> 12:07.060
restaurants for birthdays.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.769
And, you know, it

12:07.101 --> 12:08.769
wouldn't kill us

12:08.811 --> 12:10.438
to stop wearing

12:08.811 --> 12:10.438
designer labels.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.814
Hal, whose life

12:10.480 --> 12:11.814
are you leading?

12:11.856 --> 12:14.775
We don't do

12:11.856 --> 12:14.775
any of that stuff.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.611
We can't afford this baby.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.279
Where's he going to sleep?

12:18.321 --> 12:20.240
We're not even going

12:18.321 --> 12:20.240
to be able to feed him

12:20.281 --> 12:21.782
after my mother

12:20.281 --> 12:21.782
gets finished with us.

12:21.824 --> 12:25.495
Oh, God,

12:21.824 --> 12:25.495
this is so unfair.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.247
Honey, relax.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.789
Here's what we're

12:27.288 --> 12:28.789
going to do.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.500
First, I'm going

12:28.831 --> 12:30.500
to go out

12:30.542 --> 12:32.793
and get you some mint

12:30.542 --> 12:32.793
chocolate chip ice cream.

12:32.835 --> 12:33.961
Now, that always helps.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.796
And then we're just

12:34.003 --> 12:35.796
going to sit down

12:35.838 --> 12:37.424
and figure this

12:35.838 --> 12:37.424
all out, hmm?

12:40.635 --> 12:45.223
Hey, everything

12:40.635 --> 12:45.223
is going to be okay, hmm?

12:45.265 --> 12:46.807
We'll find a way.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.101
We always do.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.228
Promise.

12:55.858 --> 12:59.112
(bawling):

12:55.858 --> 12:59.112
Oh, no!

13:00.905 --> 13:04.492
Why me?!

13:04.534 --> 13:05.702
No.

13:05.744 --> 13:10.998
Why?! Why?!

13:11.040 --> 13:13.834
Why?! Why, why,

13:13.876 --> 13:15.836
why, why?!

13:15.878 --> 13:17.547
(screaming, crying)

13:17.589 --> 13:19.840
Why?!

13:19.882 --> 13:21.842
(screaming)

13:21.884 --> 13:23.886
Oh, why?!

13:37.484 --> 13:39.986
(coughing, sputtering)

13:43.698 --> 13:45.866
Okay, I'm really

13:43.698 --> 13:45.866
getting sick of this.

13:45.908 --> 13:49.828
Nobody should know a beetle

13:45.908 --> 13:49.828
tastes better than a june bug.

13:50.622 --> 13:51.790
Can I have more pancakes?

13:51.830 --> 13:53.040
HAL: You've had ten

13:51.830 --> 13:53.040
already, Reese.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.875
Don't be a pig.

13:54.917 --> 13:55.876
We need to save

13:55.918 --> 13:57.378
every penny we can.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.340
Dewey, go easy

13:58.505 --> 14:00.340
on the orange juice.

14:00.381 --> 14:01.758
That stuff doesn't grow on...

14:01.800 --> 14:02.925
Wait, it does.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.885
So, why is it so damn expensive?

14:04.927 --> 14:06.805
Yeah, Dewey, you wouldn't

14:04.927 --> 14:06.805
want to be greedy.

14:06.845 --> 14:08.889
A greedy,

14:06.845 --> 14:08.889
conniving old lady

14:08.931 --> 14:11.392
who doesn't have a shred of

14:08.931 --> 14:11.392
decency in her entire body.

14:11.434 --> 14:14.187
The hooligan

14:11.434 --> 14:14.187
talks of decency.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.605
(chuckles)

14:15.647 --> 14:16.773
How amusing.

14:16.815 --> 14:17.898
Why is that amusing?

14:17.940 --> 14:19.150
None of your business.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.193
Okay.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.778
Hal, I need

14:20.234 --> 14:21.778
to talk to you

14:21.820 --> 14:23.363
about, uh...

14:21.820 --> 14:23.363
the thing.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.405
Which thing?

14:24.447 --> 14:25.573
The first thing,

14:25.615 --> 14:26.991
or the other thing?

14:27.033 --> 14:28.535
They know about the thing.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.744
Shut up.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.412
It's probably a

14:29.786 --> 14:31.412
different thing.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.711
I just got off the phone

14:34.957 --> 14:37.711
with the insurance company.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.920
They say that our rates

14:37.752 --> 14:39.920
are going to triple.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.088
What?!

14:41.130 --> 14:42.549
Even putting in the claim

14:42.590 --> 14:44.425
is going to cost us.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.425
Triple?!

14:44.467 --> 14:46.052
Oh...

14:47.970 --> 14:49.930
Well, I guess we should

14:47.970 --> 14:49.930
probably tell the kids.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.099
Who knows, they might have

14:49.972 --> 14:52.099
a few bucks we can borrow.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.934
No, let's not tell them yet.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.228
I know my mother.

14:55.269 --> 14:57.104
I know that if we give her

14:55.269 --> 14:57.104
one last chance,

14:57.146 --> 14:58.648
she'll do the right thing.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.316
I just know it.

15:00.358 --> 15:01.526
And you understand

15:01.568 --> 15:02.861
everything

15:01.568 --> 15:02.861
I've explained to you

15:02.902 --> 15:04.445
about the

15:02.902 --> 15:04.445
deposition process?

15:05.613 --> 15:06.947
Yes.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.157
You don't have

15:06.989 --> 15:08.157
to do that.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.909
Sorry.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.120
No, no, no, no, no,

15:11.578 --> 15:13.120
sorry, Malcolm.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.622
You can't come

15:13.162 --> 15:14.622
in right now.

15:14.664 --> 15:15.956
What are you talking about?

15:14.664 --> 15:15.956
I live here.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.375
Sorry, you just can't.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.959
Now I can't even go

15:17.417 --> 15:18.959
into my own house?

15:19.001 --> 15:20.961
Why am I always the one

15:19.001 --> 15:20.961
singled out for abuse?

15:21.003 --> 15:22.129
Reese and Dewey are in there.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.840
No, they're not.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.925
Francis and Piama took

15:23.882 --> 15:25.925
them miniature golfing.

15:32.515 --> 15:35.560
And moreover,

15:32.515 --> 15:35.560
being of sound mind and body

15:35.602 --> 15:38.563
and with...

15:35.602 --> 15:38.563
just cause... wait.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.022
Strike that.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.022
Sir, we just

15:40.064 --> 15:41.733
need you to

15:40.064 --> 15:41.733
state your name.

15:42.942 --> 15:43.984
(glass shatters)

15:45.027 --> 15:46.237
I'm sorry I had to do that,

15:46.279 --> 15:48.197
but I had no other choice.

15:48.239 --> 15:49.990
I am still a member

15:48.239 --> 15:49.990
of this family,

15:50.032 --> 15:51.992
no matter how hard

15:50.032 --> 15:51.992
you're trying to forget it,

15:52.034 --> 15:54.788
and I deserve the right to know

15:52.034 --> 15:54.788
what's going on around here.

15:54.829 --> 15:56.997
Malcolm, this does

15:54.829 --> 15:56.997
not concern you!

15:57.039 --> 15:58.082
Yes, it does! There's something

15:58.124 --> 16:00.000
really weird happening

15:58.124 --> 16:00.000
in this house,

16:00.042 --> 16:01.252
and all I'm asking

16:01.294 --> 16:02.503
is for the courtesy

16:02.545 --> 16:04.004
of not being treated

16:02.545 --> 16:04.004
like an idiot.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.924
Well, your evil grandmother

16:04.046 --> 16:05.924
is suing us!

16:05.965 --> 16:07.007
Did you hear that?

16:07.049 --> 16:08.008
He called me evil.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.260
I want that on record.

16:10.845 --> 16:12.054
Okay, so she's suing us.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.432
You don't have

16:12.096 --> 16:14.432
to keep that from me.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.642
It's horrible, but

16:15.683 --> 16:17.017
everything she does

16:15.683 --> 16:17.017
is horrible.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.018
There's no reason...

16:18.060 --> 16:19.186
And your mother

16:18.060 --> 16:19.186
is pregnant.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.021
Pregnant?! Are you nuts?!

16:21.063 --> 16:22.273
That's the dumbest thing

16:21.063 --> 16:22.273
I've ever heard!

16:22.315 --> 16:25.401
How could you do that to me,

16:22.315 --> 16:25.401
to all of us?!

16:25.443 --> 16:27.027
What the hell

16:25.443 --> 16:27.027
were you thinking?!

16:27.069 --> 16:28.070
FRANCIS:

16:27.069 --> 16:28.070
All clear?

16:28.112 --> 16:29.614
I kept them out

16:28.112 --> 16:29.614
as long as I could,

16:29.656 --> 16:31.658
but $10 doesn't buy

16:29.656 --> 16:31.658
a whole lot of mini-golf.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.451
You knew about this

16:31.699 --> 16:33.451
and didn't tell us?

16:33.493 --> 16:35.453
Tell us what?

16:33.493 --> 16:35.453
(truck horn honks)

16:35.495 --> 16:37.455
Oh, it's here!

16:37.497 --> 16:39.707
Maybe we should take

16:37.497 --> 16:39.707
a five-minute break.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.041
I don't pay for breaks.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.252
(phone ringing)

16:43.294 --> 16:45.463
Mom made me promise

16:43.294 --> 16:45.463
not to tell you.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.715
For some reason, she was

16:45.505 --> 16:47.715
trying to protect Grandma.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.884
What does Grandma have to do

16:47.757 --> 16:49.884
with Mom being pregnant?

16:49.926 --> 16:51.093
PIAMA:

16:49.926 --> 16:51.093
What, you're pregnant?

16:51.135 --> 16:52.762
No...!

16:52.804 --> 16:54.138
You're having

16:52.804 --> 16:54.138
another kid?

16:54.180 --> 16:55.849
What is wrong

16:54.180 --> 16:55.849
with you two?!

16:55.890 --> 16:57.224
You don't have enough

16:55.890 --> 16:57.224
problems as it is?!

16:57.266 --> 16:58.977
I can't believe you boys.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.771
This is the way you react

16:59.018 --> 17:01.771
to wonderful news?!

17:01.813 --> 17:03.230
This is a blessing!

17:03.272 --> 17:05.065
You should be ashamed

17:03.272 --> 17:05.065
of yourselves!

17:05.107 --> 17:07.026
Psst. I need

17:05.107 --> 17:07.026
to talk to you.

17:08.486 --> 17:09.570
What?

17:09.612 --> 17:11.071
Well, we don't

17:09.612 --> 17:11.071
have to worry

17:11.113 --> 17:12.156
about our insurance

17:11.113 --> 17:12.156
premiums going up.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.240
They just canceled

17:12.198 --> 17:13.240
our policy.

17:13.282 --> 17:14.993
What are you

17:13.282 --> 17:14.993
talking about?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.703
They said something about

17:15.034 --> 17:16.703
too many late payments.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.078
Some kind of loophole.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.163
So, whatever

17:18.120 --> 17:19.163
your mom gets

17:19.205 --> 17:21.081
we have to pay out

17:19.205 --> 17:21.081
of our own pocket.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.583
Oh, my God!

17:22.625 --> 17:25.044
(truck beeping outside)

17:27.380 --> 17:29.089
I have good news.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.341
You know

17:29.131 --> 17:30.341
how everybody's

17:30.383 --> 17:31.467
been so depressed

17:30.383 --> 17:31.467
around here lately?

17:31.509 --> 17:33.302
Well, I was thinking.

17:33.344 --> 17:35.095
What could I do

17:33.344 --> 17:35.095
to cheer everyone up?

17:35.137 --> 17:36.472
And then it hit me.

17:36.514 --> 17:38.098
It was the most obvious thing

17:36.514 --> 17:38.098
in the world.

17:38.140 --> 17:41.394
I bought us

17:38.140 --> 17:41.394
an above-ground swimming pool.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.103
And the best part is

17:43.145 --> 17:45.314
you don't have to pay for it

17:43.145 --> 17:45.314
for six months.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.401
It's a raft with cup holders.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.403
They're setting the pool up

17:48.442 --> 17:50.403
right now.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.405
Oh, and don't just thank me.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.114
Dewey was in on it, too.

17:54.156 --> 17:57.201
He's lying!

17:54.156 --> 17:57.201
Huh?

17:57.243 --> 17:58.912
Wh-What's going on?

17:58.953 --> 18:00.371
Mom's pregnant.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.122
What?! You can't do that!

18:02.164 --> 18:04.124
Do you know how dangerous it is

18:02.164 --> 18:04.124
to have a baby and a pool?

18:04.166 --> 18:05.543
All right, that's it!

18:05.585 --> 18:07.962
Boys, get to your room

18:05.585 --> 18:07.962
right now.

18:08.004 --> 18:11.424
And you, you get that truck

18:08.004 --> 18:11.424
out of my backyard.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.847
I can't believe it.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.847
Another baby?

18:17.889 --> 18:19.139
They're nuts!

18:19.181 --> 18:21.059
None of us gets enough

18:19.181 --> 18:21.059
of anything as it is.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.310
Now we're going to have

18:21.100 --> 18:23.310
to split it five ways?

18:23.352 --> 18:25.396
What are you guys

18:23.352 --> 18:25.396
complaining about?

18:25.438 --> 18:27.607
All I ever had

18:25.438 --> 18:27.607
was being the youngest.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.149
Now I won't even

18:27.648 --> 18:29.149
have that.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.610
You guys don't get it.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.737
You're only looking at this

18:30.651 --> 18:32.737
in the short term.

18:32.779 --> 18:33.947
We're screwed for life.

18:33.988 --> 18:35.656
And I actually had

18:33.988 --> 18:35.656
some potential.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.241
I could have gone to college.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.826
Listen to you guys.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.161
Nice family this kid is

18:38.868 --> 18:41.161
going to be born into.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.747
Hey, we're allowed to be upset.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.791
We're the ones getting left out

18:42.789 --> 18:44.791
while every resource

18:44.832 --> 18:47.126
this family has

18:44.832 --> 18:47.126
is going to our baby brother.

18:52.006 --> 18:53.841
Brother?

18:57.637 --> 18:59.179
How much is she costing me?

18:59.221 --> 19:01.307
I'm not paying for your

18:59.221 --> 19:01.307
little tart of a girlfriend.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.602
Mother, we

19:02.224 --> 19:04.602
need to talk.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.980
Ida, we have no insurance.

19:07.021 --> 19:09.690
We were late on our payments,

19:07.021 --> 19:09.690
and they canceled us.

19:09.732 --> 19:11.191
LOIS:

19:09.732 --> 19:11.191
If you don't stop

19:11.233 --> 19:15.154
this lawsuit, we'll be

19:11.233 --> 19:15.154
ruined, do you understand?

19:16.238 --> 19:17.907
I'm sure you'll manage somehow.

19:17.949 --> 19:19.366
There are agencies.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.119
Welfare.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.163
But who is there

19:21.160 --> 19:24.163
to help me, huh? Nobody.

19:24.956 --> 19:26.373
REESE:

19:24.956 --> 19:26.373
Mom, Dad,

19:26.415 --> 19:29.251
we just want to tell you

19:26.415 --> 19:29.251
that we were sorry

19:29.293 --> 19:30.878
for the way we acted

19:29.293 --> 19:30.878
about the baby.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.212
MALCOLM:

19:30.920 --> 19:32.212
Yeah. We figured it out.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.214
Reese and I can double

19:32.254 --> 19:34.214
up in the bed again.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.675
And I could sleep with the baby.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.468
It'll be fun

19:35.716 --> 19:37.468
having a busy box again.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.219
FRANCIS: Yeah, and I could

19:37.510 --> 19:39.219
probably send home

19:39.261 --> 19:40.972
30 bucks a week

19:39.261 --> 19:40.972
to help out.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.267
Thank you, boys.

19:45.309 --> 19:48.896
Hello! This lawsuit

19:45.309 --> 19:48.896
isn't going to go away

19:48.938 --> 19:51.190
just 'cause

19:48.938 --> 19:51.190
you ignore me.

19:52.775 --> 19:54.234
Where do you think you're going?

19:54.276 --> 19:56.154
I'm out of here.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.321
They have no insurance.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.239
What do you think,

19:57.363 --> 19:59.239
I'm going to take 40 percent

19:59.281 --> 20:00.867
of this rundown dump

19:59.281 --> 20:00.867
of a house?

20:00.908 --> 20:02.910
30 percent, and yes.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.328
Let me explain something to you.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.664
This house would fit in my house

20:04.370 --> 20:06.664
as a garage,

20:06.706 --> 20:09.249
but then I'd have to park

20:06.706 --> 20:09.249
my Porsche in the driveway.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.293
Now, I don't mind

20:09.291 --> 20:11.293
tossing innocent people

20:11.335 --> 20:12.503
into the street.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.672
I just don't do it for free.

20:22.138 --> 20:26.225
I think I feel

20:22.138 --> 20:26.225
well enough to travel.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.647
Francis and Grandma

20:29.520 --> 20:31.647
are finally gone,

20:31.689 --> 20:33.524
and everything's back to normal.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.735
Well, not exactly normal.

20:35.776 --> 20:38.278
Dad told us that during

20:35.776 --> 20:38.278
the first trimester of pregnancy

20:38.320 --> 20:40.156
women sometimes get

20:38.320 --> 20:40.156
a tiny bit hormonal.

20:40.198 --> 20:41.448
HAL:

20:40.198 --> 20:41.448
Quick, boys!

20:41.490 --> 20:42.867
Someone left the cap

20:41.490 --> 20:42.867
off the toothpaste!

20:42.909 --> 20:44.535
(boys screaming)
