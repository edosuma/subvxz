00:10.970 --> 00:15.015
3 YEARS AGO

00:19.520 --> 00:21.605
Hey, Dad, there's no plate yet!

00:21.897 --> 00:25.317
This is not a car, son!

00:25.443 --> 00:26.902
This is a spaceship.

00:26.986 --> 00:27.987
Is it insured?

00:28.154 --> 00:30.656
Against theft, crash and jealousy?

00:30.740 --> 00:33.033
-It's not insured.
-Jealousy!

00:34.368 --> 00:37.204
Guys, I'd like to take a picture
of us together.

00:37.288 --> 00:39.165
I'm so proud! Oh, guys.

00:39.415 --> 00:42.209
Now I have to keep the promise
I made to Saint Jude.

00:42.334 --> 00:45.504
-Oh, guys.
-Son, didn't I tell you it was worth it?

00:45.838 --> 00:48.507
You studied a lot all the time

00:48.591 --> 00:52.803
while your friends
were partying at the beach.

00:52.887 --> 00:54.722
Now you just enjoy it.

00:55.097 --> 00:57.892
I'm sure his life will be calm.

00:58.017 --> 01:00.644
A great path,

01:00.728 --> 01:02.396
a great retirement.

01:02.480 --> 01:05.649
I barely started my first year,
you're thinking of the last.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.193
Hey, everybody.

01:07.276 --> 01:08.402
Let's go.

01:08.486 --> 01:10.154
Move over.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.071
Come on.

01:11.155 --> 01:13.741
One, two, three.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.568
Look at me, Patrícia.

01:49.652 --> 01:51.612
Does it look like real sweat?

01:52.530 --> 01:53.906
Are my cheeks rosy?

01:54.615 --> 01:56.951
-They are.
-They're pink.

01:59.745 --> 02:01.956
-I'm all sweaty.
-Let me see...

02:02.206 --> 02:03.874
Wait. Take it easy.

02:04.083 --> 02:04.917
Here.

02:06.168 --> 02:07.002
Perfect.

02:08.671 --> 02:09.672
Hi, ladies.

02:09.755 --> 02:14.468
I'm here to talk about the My New Fabulous
Fitness Muse project.

02:14.718 --> 02:16.637
After exercise, there's nothing better

02:16.720 --> 02:19.056
than having a My New Fabulous
My New Shake...

02:19.139 --> 02:20.599
Cut!

02:20.683 --> 02:24.854
-It looks like a jelly ad.
-I'm not cut out for that.

02:25.020 --> 02:25.855
Yes, you are.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.606
When you talk about the shake,

02:28.315 --> 02:29.692
say it's after working out.

02:29.900 --> 02:33.028
Don't say "exercise."
Old people talk like this.

02:33.404 --> 02:34.572
-Okay?
-Okay.

02:34.738 --> 02:35.656
For Christ's sake.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.950
So, ladies, after working out,

02:38.033 --> 02:40.536
this shake is great,
it's good for your skin,

02:40.661 --> 02:42.830
for your hair,

02:42.955 --> 02:45.082
-for your skin, for your nails...
-Cut.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.417
-Why?
-Again.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.168
-Don't repeat yourself.
-Again.

02:48.252 --> 02:49.879
Let's go.

02:49.962 --> 02:50.921
Joyful.

02:52.339 --> 02:53.173
Action.

02:53.299 --> 02:56.760
This shake is great, it has collagen,

02:56.844 --> 02:58.679
-vitamin B12...
-Cut.

02:58.762 --> 03:00.264
What, Patrícia?

03:00.347 --> 03:02.683
Conga, when you talk
about the ingredients,

03:02.892 --> 03:06.562
say you love them,
you can't live without them.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.230
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

03:08.314 --> 03:09.648
Okay? Let's do it.

03:09.815 --> 03:10.941
I'm gonna do the same.

03:11.150 --> 03:12.151
Action.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.112
Ladies, this shake has everything I love,

03:15.195 --> 03:18.365
it has maltodextrin hydrochloride,

03:18.449 --> 03:20.826
salicylic acetate,

03:20.910 --> 03:23.037
sibutramine, Patrícia.

03:24.330 --> 03:25.956
-Oh, no.
-What is it?

03:26.206 --> 03:28.125
The phone died. Give me the charger.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.793
-It's in the car.
-No way.

03:31.253 --> 03:32.171
Caco!

03:34.006 --> 03:34.882
Caco.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.509
Can I borrow your charger?

03:39.219 --> 03:40.304
Caco.

03:42.431 --> 03:43.349
Caco!

03:43.807 --> 03:45.517
He's still sleeping?

03:46.018 --> 03:47.561
Caco, open the door.

03:48.771 --> 03:49.647
Caco!

03:50.814 --> 03:52.191
Don't you have a spare key?

03:52.483 --> 03:54.276
The spare key.

03:55.694 --> 03:56.779
Caco.

03:57.488 --> 03:59.448
Camila, we're at a dead end.

04:01.784 --> 04:04.578
-I'd better leave. We'll finish it later.
-Okay.

04:05.663 --> 04:06.830
Take it easy, Caco.

04:07.289 --> 04:08.499
Everything will be fine.

04:12.294 --> 04:14.630
We're so close to paying off this flat.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.675
Think about how much we invested in it.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.595
Don't you think I know this?

04:22.429 --> 04:25.265
Stop being so proud
and talk to your parents.

04:25.724 --> 04:28.602
Camila, my parents are retired.

04:28.727 --> 04:29.770
What do you want?

04:30.354 --> 04:32.272
That I take their money away?

04:33.023 --> 04:34.942
At the moment, it's the only way out.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.001
Alone? Never.

04:52.251 --> 04:54.378
We're always here for you.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.008
For Christ's sake,
my son thinks he can't count on me.

04:59.425 --> 05:02.970
I know, Mom. I still have to
receive the money from Petrosil.

05:03.387 --> 05:06.390
The clock is ticking.
This fear of losing the flat...

05:06.473 --> 05:07.683
Son!

05:07.808 --> 05:11.645
Why don't you get a temporary job
while you wait for this money?

05:12.187 --> 05:13.480
Our neighbor's son

05:13.564 --> 05:15.357
goes to Miami every three months.

05:15.441 --> 05:17.818
He brings lots of stuff
to sell on the Internet.

05:17.901 --> 05:20.863
For Christ's sake, Zélia,
our son's a chemical engineer.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.032
He can't sell contraband.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.165
Son.

05:31.540 --> 05:32.374
Carlos.

05:32.791 --> 05:33.751
Chin up.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.210
Look at your mom.

05:36.545 --> 05:37.546
I want you...

05:38.922 --> 05:39.923
I want you

05:41.300 --> 05:42.259
to keep

05:46.764 --> 05:47.931
the Portinari.

05:48.474 --> 05:51.226
-Zélia. For Christ's sake.
-No.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.562
We can solve this another way.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.522
Easy, Mom. Easy.

05:55.606 --> 05:56.732
Easy, Mom. Easy.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.612
-Dad?
-Are you sure?

06:02.529 --> 06:04.323
Our family has had this painting...

06:04.406 --> 06:07.326
Since before I was born.
Uncle Alberto gave it to her.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.870
He didn't give it to her. She bought it

06:10.162 --> 06:12.623
from your godfather. He was an art dealer.

06:12.706 --> 06:13.707
I didn't know.

06:14.083 --> 06:16.877
I wanted to support my brother.
May God rest his soul.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.465
He was her favorite brother.

06:22.257 --> 06:26.428
When you were born, she said,
"I want Alberto to be his godfather."

06:26.512 --> 06:27.846
I didn't have a say.

06:27.930 --> 06:29.598
Alberto was a great godfather.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.141
Wasn't he, Carlos Augusto?

06:32.101 --> 06:32.935
The best.

06:33.435 --> 06:34.478
My favorite uncle.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.147
Then it's settled.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.275
The Portinari is yours.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.960
I wish you the best of luck
on your journey.

06:58.252 --> 07:01.672
I want you to know that,
since the moment I saw you,

07:02.506 --> 07:05.050
-I loved you.
-Thanks, Mom. Love you, too.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.970
She's saying goodbye to the painting.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.972
Okay, sure.

07:10.055 --> 07:13.433
Mom, I'll never forget what you did, okay?

07:13.976 --> 07:16.186
I know how much
this painting means to you.

07:16.270 --> 07:17.437
To me, too.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.982
Sure. Everything will be fine.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.943
You're gonna have enough money
for your retirement.

07:23.861 --> 07:25.404
-Bye, son.
-Bye.

07:38.834 --> 07:41.461
<i>It's great for your hair, for your skin...</i>

07:41.587 --> 07:44.798
Okay, how do I delete this part?

07:45.090 --> 07:49.469
Just click on that menu.
You'll delete it eventually.

07:49.720 --> 07:50.846
Are you sure?

07:51.430 --> 07:52.347
Wait.

07:53.891 --> 07:54.850
Damn.

07:55.309 --> 07:56.560
-It's ruined.
-No, wait.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.020
I'll fix this.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.521
Here.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.315
No, it's not here.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.443
What's this?

08:04.568 --> 08:05.652
Patrícia, look.

08:05.736 --> 08:08.572
-Get the hammer before I throw this away.
-Easy.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.199
-Easy?
-I'll fix this.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.159
I'll think of something.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.084
Wait a minute...

08:21.501 --> 08:23.837
Here! José Carlos. I found him.

08:24.463 --> 08:26.924
José Carlos, he's wonderful.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.800
How much will he charge me?

08:29.635 --> 08:32.137
Whatever it takes to get us out of this.

08:32.512 --> 08:33.597
I'll borrow from you.

09:07.631 --> 09:08.674
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.384
-José Carlos?
-Yes.

09:10.717 --> 09:11.677
I'm Camila.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.929
We texted about the video editing.

09:14.137 --> 09:15.764
You must have talked to my son.

09:17.266 --> 09:18.100
Junior!

09:19.268 --> 09:20.519
You can go to his office.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.020
Thanks.

09:23.689 --> 09:24.606
Son?

09:25.816 --> 09:26.775
Excuse me.

09:27.401 --> 09:30.988
The video you sent me had a high bitrate.

09:31.655 --> 09:33.073
-Have a seat.
-Excuse me.

09:33.323 --> 09:36.076
The RGB was kinda distorted,

09:36.159 --> 09:38.453
but I fixed it. No worries.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.080
I think it'll work.

09:42.249 --> 09:45.711
What aspect ratio do you want?

09:45.836 --> 09:46.962
Come again?

09:48.672 --> 09:50.674
So, look.

09:50.882 --> 09:54.678
-There's 16:9, 4:3. Got it?
-Yeah.

09:55.012 --> 09:57.431
Whatever you think is best.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.766
You have this fitness vibe.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.727
I thought some time lapse,

10:01.810 --> 10:05.355
some datamosh will look awesome.
Don't worry.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.357
Absolutely. Awesome.

10:07.441 --> 10:10.235
Great, I'll put it on the workflow,

10:10.610 --> 10:12.446
I'll do some rendering, okay?

10:12.529 --> 10:14.614
-I'll post it today.
-Junior.

10:14.698 --> 10:15.907
Junior, just a minute.

10:16.575 --> 10:17.993
How much will that be?

10:19.077 --> 10:20.579
You know I'm underage, right?

10:20.662 --> 10:22.331
Yes, absolutely.

10:22.414 --> 10:25.625
You can get me
a rollerwall skate as a gift,

10:26.209 --> 10:28.295
or an X24 controller.

10:28.712 --> 10:29.546
That one.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.089
I'm cool with that.

10:31.506 --> 10:33.842
Work a miracle on this video, please.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.761
I need to make money online.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.305
-No problem.
-No problem.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.486
We need to find another business ASAP.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.863
Since I told my mother I'm a businessman,

10:54.946 --> 10:56.031
she's told everybody.

10:56.365 --> 10:58.950
Bro, take it easy. We don't need to rush.

10:59.117 --> 11:02.120
The desperate situation's over.
Don't push me.

11:02.204 --> 11:03.497
Jeez, you're so calm.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.665
-Did you win the lottery?
-Almost.

11:05.749 --> 11:10.295
My parents, mostly my mother,
gave me the Portinari to pay my debts.

11:10.629 --> 11:11.588
What?

11:12.255 --> 11:15.967
I was sure they'd give you a kidney
instead of that painting.

11:16.051 --> 11:18.720
Marcinho, now I'm gonna fix things.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.139
Hey, you nailed it.

11:21.223 --> 11:23.225
We'll do so much with that money!

11:23.350 --> 11:26.103
My uncle works with multilevel marketing.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.523
It's great. You invite two people,
they invite four people,

11:29.606 --> 11:31.608
-they invite eight more...
-A pyramid.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.069
Totally different.

11:34.277 --> 11:36.947
It's something else.
It's multilevel marketing.

11:37.197 --> 11:40.450
You earn money
as people invite other people.

11:40.575 --> 11:42.119
-You earn it.
-I got it.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.037
It's amazing. And you don't work.

12:18.780 --> 12:19.865
Hi, ladies.

12:20.157 --> 12:23.869
I'm here to begin
My New Fabulous Fitness Muse challenge.

12:23.952 --> 12:24.953
Come with me.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.414
<i>Access denied.</i>

12:27.497 --> 12:31.168
We won't let any obstacles get in our way.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.503
Deal? Stay strong. Bye.

13:00.489 --> 13:01.990
Hello.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.202
Hello, welcome to the Bodythere Temple.

13:28.934 --> 13:31.895
-Perfect. How much is the subscription?
-Here.

13:34.898 --> 13:35.899
Wow!

13:36.566 --> 13:37.734
That's a great deal.

13:38.109 --> 13:40.529
Considering all that's offered.

13:40.612 --> 13:43.740
The registration
and the fit exam are not included.

13:45.283 --> 13:46.201
Jeez.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.746
Too bad there's no Kundalini yoga,
that's what I do the most.

13:50.413 --> 13:53.291
Unfortunately we don't have Kundalini yet.

13:54.042 --> 13:54.960
I know.

13:55.418 --> 13:58.755
Too bad. I'm gonna take a look
at Body Rio because...

13:58.838 --> 14:01.466
I can offer you a two-week trial.

14:01.550 --> 14:02.384
How about that?

14:03.343 --> 14:04.344
Really?

14:04.427 --> 14:05.762
I'll see if I fit in.

14:06.221 --> 14:07.847
-Great.
-Thanks.

14:17.691 --> 14:18.900
Hi, ladies.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.737
Back to the My New Fabulous
Fitness Muse challenge.

14:22.946 --> 14:24.072
I'm here with you.

14:24.823 --> 14:28.868
You, who let your body and health
fall into decline.

14:28.994 --> 14:30.704
I know exactly what it's like.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.330
But also,

14:32.622 --> 14:34.916
I wanna prove it's possible to change.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.085
It's not easy,

14:37.502 --> 14:39.170
but nothing's gonna stop us.

14:39.671 --> 14:40.755
Shall we get started?

14:59.232 --> 15:01.234
What a mess.

15:01.610 --> 15:05.238
Do you know where my X24 controller is?
We can only find one.

15:06.448 --> 15:07.824
I have no idea.

15:07.907 --> 15:08.992
It's like this one.

15:10.619 --> 15:11.620
Let me see it.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.252
No, I haven't seen it.

15:29.971 --> 15:31.806
Hi, ladies, good morning.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.976
I came by to tell you
I woke up feeling terrible,

15:35.185 --> 15:38.146
no energy at all, my belly's swollen,

15:38.229 --> 15:39.564
you know how it is, right?

15:40.023 --> 15:42.067
Well, first thing in the morning,

15:42.275 --> 15:45.111
I'll have my shake, get my energy back

15:45.195 --> 15:47.113
and run to my transformation project.

15:47.322 --> 15:49.032
You know...

15:50.700 --> 15:51.701
Hi.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.912
<i>Thanks a lot for the controller.</i>

15:54.412 --> 15:57.207
Hey, your video went viral,
you got lots of likes.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.416
<i>Send me more!</i>

15:59.417 --> 16:01.336
Go check your Instagram and see it.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.171
You went viral, man.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.297
<i>Die!</i>

16:04.381 --> 16:05.382
Die!

16:06.132 --> 16:07.133
Die!

16:25.151 --> 16:27.320
Where did this espresso machine come from?

16:28.154 --> 16:30.824
I bought it with my credit card.

16:31.366 --> 16:32.450
By the way,

16:32.701 --> 16:34.536
you don't need to look

16:34.744 --> 16:38.123
for my controller anymore.
I'm gonna buy a new one.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.750
What's this nonsense, Caco?

16:41.251 --> 16:43.753
Spending money as if you can.
Are you nuts?

16:46.923 --> 16:47.924
I can.

16:48.550 --> 16:49.467
What do you mean?

16:49.718 --> 16:51.428
The Petrosil settlement's out?

16:53.888 --> 16:54.889
I can't believe it.

16:55.473 --> 16:56.933
Yeah, the Portinari.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.018
I sent the art dealer a picture.

16:59.102 --> 17:02.313
He said it's worth 400 grand.

17:02.689 --> 17:06.568
There's enough to pay our debts
and for my parents' retirement.

17:06.943 --> 17:10.488
I thought your mom would give a kidney
instead of this painting.

17:27.005 --> 17:28.214
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi, son.

17:28.298 --> 17:29.924
-Can I talk to Mom?
-Sure.

17:30.049 --> 17:34.971
Your mom can't talk right now,
she's not feeling well. Call later.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.890
Okay. Is she all right?

17:38.308 --> 17:41.352
Yes, she is. She's bouncing back.

17:42.020 --> 17:42.854
Bye.

17:43.646 --> 17:44.606
Bye.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.574
Hi, guys. I'm about to start my training,

17:54.657 --> 17:56.242
I've already had my shake,

17:56.326 --> 17:59.954
let's go for it.
We'll have another 15 minutes.

18:00.038 --> 18:02.582
Let's go? Down.

18:02.874 --> 18:05.168
Let it all burn. Go.

18:05.794 --> 18:06.836
Tighten your abs.

18:06.961 --> 18:09.172
Hi, are you done? Can I use it?

18:09.464 --> 18:11.174
Not yet.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.177
You've interrupted my stories,
I'll have to restart it.

18:14.552 --> 18:17.347
Then you can have it. I'm sorry.

18:19.516 --> 18:21.684
Hi, guys. I'm here to start my training,

18:21.768 --> 18:23.436
I've already had my shake.

18:23.770 --> 18:27.690
Let's go for it.
My New Fabulous Fitness Muse challenge.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.400
-You know...
-Hi, excuse me.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.236
The manager wants to talk.

18:31.486 --> 18:32.821
During my workout?

18:32.904 --> 18:34.322
Yes, please, follow me.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.574
Okay.

18:47.752 --> 18:50.713
-Hi.
-Hi, dear. How are you?

18:51.130 --> 18:54.008
There was lots of free equipment.
Why did she complain?

18:54.259 --> 18:57.053
I saw you making videos inside the gym.

18:57.178 --> 18:59.222
-Me?
-I think it's great.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.975
Those fitness stories are
really encouraging.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.059
That's me!

19:03.184 --> 19:04.727
-Are you an influencer?
-Yes.

19:04.894 --> 19:05.728
Your account?

19:05.979 --> 19:08.398
CamilaSilvaMyNewFabulous, no spaces.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.400
CamilaSilva... This one?

19:10.733 --> 19:11.568
Yes.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.654
That's so cool.

19:15.363 --> 19:17.490
Okay, I guess we can make a partnership

19:17.574 --> 19:20.827
where you tag the gym during
your transformation

19:21.202 --> 19:23.913
and we can give you a free month.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.164
Okay, but...

19:25.331 --> 19:27.500
At least four months for this exposure.

19:27.584 --> 19:31.004
Three months and one month
of My New Fabulous shake for me.

19:31.087 --> 19:34.132
-Three months and a stand by the door.
-Never by the door.

19:34.215 --> 19:35.216
Reception counter.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.301
-Deal.
-Deal.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.021
The painting is worth 550.

19:51.316 --> 19:52.150
Yeah...

19:52.901 --> 19:54.068
Just a minute, please.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.035
<i>Hi, son.</i>

20:02.243 --> 20:03.661
Hi, Dad, can I talk to Mom?

20:05.204 --> 20:07.165
Caco, let me be honest with you.

20:07.248 --> 20:09.125
Your mom is not very well.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.711
She's taken some sleeping pills.

20:12.962 --> 20:13.796
-Yeah.
-Really?

20:14.130 --> 20:15.715
You know, she'll get over it.

20:16.090 --> 20:19.510
It's her favorite brother's souvenir.

20:19.594 --> 20:20.720
That painting...

20:20.887 --> 20:22.221
-It's sad.
-Okay, so...

20:22.847 --> 20:23.848
We'll talk later.

20:24.349 --> 20:25.350
Bye.

20:29.103 --> 20:30.188
So...

20:32.398 --> 20:34.400
It's a lot of money, 550 grand.

20:35.944 --> 20:36.945
But I won't sell it.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.908
No, it's just 550 reals.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.328
-What?
-This copy is very well done.

20:45.995 --> 20:49.540
This signature doesn't match
any of Portinari's production periods.

20:49.624 --> 20:51.417
Compare it to these. Take a look.

20:52.502 --> 20:53.711
The difference is...

20:54.253 --> 20:55.421
It's alarming. Got it?

20:57.590 --> 20:59.342
Look, wait...

20:59.801 --> 21:00.718
This is a copy?

21:01.469 --> 21:03.012
It's not a real Portinari?

21:03.972 --> 21:05.765
This must be a mistake.

21:05.848 --> 21:08.184
Uncle Alberto was
a very important art dealer,

21:08.267 --> 21:10.979
you must've heard about him.
He sold it to my mom.

21:11.229 --> 21:12.772
-Alberto Moraes?
-Yes.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.691
Yeah, he's known.

21:15.692 --> 21:17.777
-And?
-And?

21:18.319 --> 21:19.320
That's not possible.

21:19.821 --> 21:21.489
It happens in the best families.

22:03.990 --> 22:04.824
Yes?

22:05.783 --> 22:07.035
How can I help you?

22:07.577 --> 22:10.413
No, wrong bathroom, I'm sorry.

22:49.952 --> 22:50.953
So?

22:51.537 --> 22:53.498
How much did you get for the painting?

22:55.083 --> 22:57.835
Caco, you're trying to fool me
with that face, right?

22:57.919 --> 22:58.920
Stop it.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.964
The Portinari is a fake?

23:02.048 --> 23:03.674
The Portinari and Uncle Alberto.

23:12.016 --> 23:15.478
Do you trust this dealer?
Don't you need a second opinion?

23:15.937 --> 23:18.815
I've been to three places.
Everybody says it's a fake.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.234
Hey, Caquinho.

23:22.360 --> 23:27.490
The good thing about hitting rock bottom
is that there's nowhere to go but up.

23:27.824 --> 23:29.784
You always say that. Look at me.

23:30.660 --> 23:31.494
That's true.

23:32.495 --> 23:33.704
Things will get better.

23:42.380 --> 23:44.549
Are you gonna tell your mom?

23:48.427 --> 23:50.054
Good morning.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.140
We need to talk about your posts.

23:52.473 --> 23:53.558
They're a hit, right?

23:53.766 --> 23:56.853
I'm gonna have to charge you
to work out here.

23:57.854 --> 24:01.649
We've got a complaint
from the plus-size community.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.110
Looks like your videos are considered

24:05.695 --> 24:06.654
fatphobic.

24:07.405 --> 24:08.489
What do you mean?

24:08.739 --> 24:10.032
Camila, on your content,

24:10.408 --> 24:12.076
you criticize swollen bellies.

24:12.243 --> 24:13.077
No.

24:13.661 --> 24:16.873
I had a digestive issue, constipation.

24:17.707 --> 24:20.209
You talked about physical transformation.

24:20.793 --> 24:24.589
Even princesses in animated movies
are already up to date.

24:24.881 --> 24:27.884
Everybody knows what really matters is

24:28.885 --> 24:30.595
-the inner transformation.
-Right.

24:30.970 --> 24:34.932
Inner transformation at a gym
whose motto is

24:35.057 --> 24:37.727
"Temple of body and youth worship."

24:37.810 --> 24:39.312
Is that it?

24:40.146 --> 24:41.939
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

24:42.023 --> 24:44.650
The owner thinks you lost
a lot of followers.

24:44.859 --> 24:48.613
To keep our partnership,
you gotta have at least 50 thousand.

24:48.696 --> 24:51.073
Can I at least
finish my transformation here?

24:51.407 --> 24:52.241
No.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.869
You can take it somewhere else.

24:55.661 --> 24:58.247
Who's discriminating now?

24:58.372 --> 25:00.791
I have the right to work out
wherever I want.

25:01.083 --> 25:02.084
Sure.

25:02.460 --> 25:05.463
You just have to pay for
registration and subscription.

25:05.546 --> 25:08.049
I'd better promote the competitor.

25:08.216 --> 25:10.301
At least they have Kundalini.

25:14.889 --> 25:16.515
But it's still very capable.

25:17.266 --> 25:18.559
It will get around.

25:19.185 --> 25:23.272
Just because it's out of date
doesn't mean it can't work again.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.025
I'm sorry. I didn't get it.

25:26.567 --> 25:28.069
Do you want to sell it or not?

25:30.696 --> 25:32.990
Just give me five minutes with it.

26:34.927 --> 26:35.970
Hey.

26:37.388 --> 26:38.639
I...

26:39.181 --> 26:43.269
Actually, I wanted to tell you
that you have chocolate on your teeth.

26:44.145 --> 26:44.979
Really?

26:45.771 --> 26:47.148
This happens all the time.

26:47.231 --> 26:49.317
-I'm sorry.
-No problem.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.152
I love chocolate.

26:51.235 --> 26:54.238
-Is it gone? Really?
-No, there's some here.

26:54.322 --> 26:55.156
Yes, here.

27:08.377 --> 27:09.337
Son...

27:12.423 --> 27:13.966
Carlos Augusto, are you sure?

27:16.135 --> 27:17.094
Mom...

27:19.263 --> 27:20.681
You should never sell this.

27:20.765 --> 27:23.184
Okay? Some things are priceless.

27:23.642 --> 27:24.477
Caco, son,

27:24.560 --> 27:26.979
this is just a phase,
you'll get through it.

27:27.063 --> 27:28.522
You gotta stay positive.

27:28.606 --> 27:32.526
Eventually you'll get your settlement,
you'll get it.

27:32.610 --> 27:35.196
You'll get another job in your field.

27:35.529 --> 27:36.655
You just have to wait.

27:37.990 --> 27:38.866
Dad,

27:39.617 --> 27:40.743
I'm tired of waiting.

27:53.422 --> 27:54.632
NEW RIDE
15 MINUTES AWAY

28:17.279 --> 28:18.197
Hi, how are you?

28:19.782 --> 28:22.326
What a blessed day.

28:22.410 --> 28:23.619
Look how beautiful.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.955
It's a perfect day. Don't you think?

28:32.086 --> 28:32.962
Mister.
