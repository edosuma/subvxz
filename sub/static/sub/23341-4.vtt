00:00.232 --> 00:01.565
Previously, on Beyond...

00:01.600 --> 00:03.324
Shoemacher's chemo pills.

00:03.324 --> 00:04.623
Happy to help in any way I can.

00:04.659 --> 00:06.525
Pleased to hear it.

00:06.561 --> 00:08.627
Dispose of him. Discreetly.

00:08.663 --> 00:12.264
It is so nice to finally meet
one of Holden's friends.

00:12.300 --> 00:14.266
I'm happy you two found each other.

00:14.302 --> 00:17.169
I cherish us, the idea
of you and I, Diane.

00:18.573 --> 00:20.639
Keep your helping hands off Christine!

00:20.675 --> 00:24.310
- I thought I was alone in here.
- You're not alone. I'm Willa.

00:24.345 --> 00:25.885
How did you say you two met again?

00:28.516 --> 00:30.583
- Maybe this was a mistake.
- Maybe it was.

01:10.224 --> 01:11.290
Holden.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.460
Holden!

01:14.495 --> 01:15.527
Come on.

01:23.638 --> 01:26.338
I thought you had this under control.

01:26.374 --> 01:32.177
So did I. I... I guess, I just
freaked out.

01:38.252 --> 01:40.285
I didn't mean it.

01:40.321 --> 01:42.388
I know. It was an accident.

01:42.423 --> 01:47.526
No. What I said, the other night,
after dinner.

01:47.561 --> 01:49.561
I want you to know, I didn't mean it.

01:50.698 --> 01:53.365
I'm really glad you decided to come.

01:57.304 --> 01:59.538
I must've made quite an impression.

02:02.376 --> 02:03.575
What happened?

02:07.415 --> 02:10.149
Guess I just... freaked out.

02:16.290 --> 02:17.556
This is familiar.

02:19.427 --> 02:21.260
Like how we first met.

02:21.295 --> 02:22.461
I remember.

02:30.638 --> 02:32.371
I missed you.

02:33.474 --> 02:35.207
I missed you, too.

02:53.661 --> 02:55.561
Are you sure?

02:55.596 --> 02:57.596
Are you sure?

02:57.631 --> 02:59.631
It's your first time?

02:59.667 --> 03:01.467
Our first time?

03:01.502 --> 03:03.135
I'm sure.

03:04.505 --> 03:07.172
Good. Me too.

03:41.575 --> 03:43.342
Are you okay?

03:43.377 --> 03:47.179
Yeah. I'm okay.

03:48.215 --> 03:49.248
Are you?

04:06.300 --> 04:07.332
Oh!

04:13.274 --> 04:15.474
- Oh. Sorry. I...
- It's okay.

04:15.509 --> 04:17.142
Should I, um...

04:17.178 --> 04:18.310
Um, yeah.

04:20.548 --> 04:22.381
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:22.416 --> 04:25.284
Sorry, uh... All I keep sayin' is sorry.

04:26.554 --> 04:27.553
Um...

04:29.557 --> 04:31.223
I have to get that.

04:31.258 --> 04:32.558
Of course. I am... I'm just gonna, um...

04:32.593 --> 04:34.293
- Yeah.
- You know...

04:34.328 --> 04:35.561
I'll be out there.

04:35.596 --> 04:37.296
- Cool.
- Cool.

05:08.329 --> 05:11.363
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:11.398 --> 05:14.299
- My dad's looking for me.
- I have to go, it's my grandfather.

05:16.437 --> 05:18.136
Is everything okay?

05:18.172 --> 05:20.372
Yeah. Uh, you?

05:20.407 --> 05:21.506
It's fine.

05:23.177 --> 05:24.311
Can you lock the door on your way out?

05:24.311 --> 05:26.578
Sure. And we'll talk later?

05:28.282 --> 05:29.314
Of course.

05:41.462 --> 05:42.628
One ninety-two.

05:42.663 --> 05:44.296
How do you know?

05:44.331 --> 05:46.164
It's my job to know.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.332
You don't have a machine?

05:47.368 --> 05:49.201
I am the machine.

05:50.337 --> 05:52.237
I can count these by hand if you want,

05:52.273 --> 05:54.640
but I've been working here since '97.

05:54.675 --> 05:56.541
I'm telling you that's 192.

05:56.577 --> 05:58.377
Count 'em by hand.

06:05.352 --> 06:07.519
- What do you want?
- Me? Nothing.

06:07.554 --> 06:09.221
The tickets are all for you.

06:09.256 --> 06:12.224
We both won 'em, so we split 50-50.

06:12.259 --> 06:13.358
Hmm.

06:14.495 --> 06:16.128
I have an idea.

06:16.163 --> 06:18.597
Why don't you pick out
my toy and I'll pick out yours.

06:18.632 --> 06:21.199
Deal?

06:21.235 --> 06:23.201
Deal.

06:23.237 --> 06:25.203
One ninety-two.

06:25.239 --> 06:28.307
I'll have one blue yo-yo, please.

06:28.342 --> 06:31.276
And I'll have that red bracelet.

06:34.315 --> 06:35.614
Hmm? Hmm.

06:35.649 --> 06:38.283
- You like it, Daddy?
- I love it.

06:38.319 --> 06:40.519
I'm actually a great yo-yo'er, you know.

06:40.554 --> 06:42.421
Show me a trick, mister.

06:42.456 --> 06:43.555
Oh.

06:47.194 --> 06:48.460
Awesome.

06:48.495 --> 06:51.263
Can we come back tomorrow?

06:51.298 --> 06:54.266
Remember, I have to go away?

06:54.301 --> 06:57.402
You always have to leave.

06:57.438 --> 06:59.204
But I always come back.

06:59.239 --> 07:00.405
Can I come?

07:00.441 --> 07:03.542
I'm sorry, honey.
Daddy's gotta do business.

07:03.577 --> 07:05.577
With who?

07:05.612 --> 07:08.113
I'm meeting one of my oldest
work friends.

07:08.148 --> 07:10.215
He was my mentor.

07:10.250 --> 07:11.283
What's a mentor?

07:12.319 --> 07:14.252
He taught me how to do my job well.

07:15.489 --> 07:17.289
Promise you'll be home soon?

07:20.361 --> 07:21.426
Promise.

07:33.540 --> 07:34.539
Damn it.

07:37.411 --> 07:39.144
Thank you, I...

07:39.179 --> 07:40.178
Charlie?

07:40.214 --> 07:41.446
Uh... It's Diane, Holden's mom.

07:41.482 --> 07:43.315
- Hi!
- Oh!

07:43.350 --> 07:47.386
Well, I prefer Diane the Greatest
Lasagna Maker in the World.

07:47.421 --> 07:49.421
Oh, it so good to see you.
What are you doing in town?

07:49.456 --> 07:51.256
Holden said that you were
at school in New York.

07:51.291 --> 07:53.625
Or was it California?

07:53.660 --> 07:58.296
Yeah. No. I... took a... leap year,

07:58.332 --> 08:00.432
- whatever it's called.
- Oh, well, good for you.

08:00.467 --> 08:03.301
So what brings you back to Fort Reed?

08:03.337 --> 08:05.337
I'm just visiting an old friend.

08:05.372 --> 08:08.273
Oh. Where are you staying?

08:09.443 --> 08:12.577
Some motel. Uh... You know, over there.

08:12.613 --> 08:15.113
- That direction somewhere.
- Oh. It must be the Dew Drop Inn.

08:15.149 --> 08:16.515
It's the only motel for 20 miles.

08:16.550 --> 08:19.484
Yeah. Probably.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.353
Here it is.

08:21.388 --> 08:23.221
The Chief's Special.

08:25.392 --> 08:28.393
The Dew Drop Inn has many charms,

08:28.429 --> 08:32.496
but security isn't one of them,
so... neither is hot water.

08:34.368 --> 08:35.600
Do you know how to use it?

08:37.404 --> 08:39.538
I do, I'm an excellent shot.

08:39.573 --> 08:42.374
I... I've always wanted to learn.

08:42.409 --> 08:44.443
Are you gonna look at this thing or not?

08:44.478 --> 08:46.578
- Yes, um...
- Yeah. Yeah. Go, go, go, go, don't...

08:46.613 --> 08:48.313
Do your thing. I've gotta run anyway.

08:48.348 --> 08:51.450
It was great to see you, Diane the
Greatest Lasagna Maker in the World.

08:51.485 --> 08:52.751
Itas great to see you, too, Charlie.

08:52.786 --> 08:55.420
And come over anytime, there's always
plenty enough to go around.

08:55.456 --> 08:56.621
Great.

09:02.296 --> 09:04.162
Crap.

09:04.198 --> 09:05.564
That what you were lookin' for?

09:05.599 --> 09:08.333
I don't know. How long is the wait?

09:08.368 --> 09:09.534
For what?

09:09.570 --> 09:11.369
To make sure I'm not, like, crazy,

09:11.405 --> 09:13.171
or an ex-con or something?

09:13.207 --> 09:14.306
You crazy?

09:14.341 --> 09:15.540
No.

09:15.576 --> 09:17.242
Ex-con?

09:17.311 --> 09:18.443
No.

09:18.479 --> 09:20.378
Then there you have it.

09:20.414 --> 09:22.581
Good for me.

09:31.492 --> 09:33.191
Do you take cash?

09:37.825 --> 09:40.168
I took a quick shower,
maybe five minutes.

09:40.168 --> 09:42.101
And when I came down to
check on him, he was gone.

09:42.136 --> 09:43.969
Where the hell could he be?

09:44.005 --> 09:45.337
Maybe he just went for a walk.

09:45.373 --> 09:48.107
- Where?
- Maybe he went to that diner.

09:48.142 --> 09:50.042
He hasn't eaten there in two years.

09:50.078 --> 09:51.343
I'm just trying to help.

09:51.379 --> 09:53.979
You could've helped
by keeping an eye on him.

09:56.384 --> 09:57.983
I'll check the diner.

09:58.019 --> 10:00.319
- I'll go with you.
- No, you... stay here.

10:02.390 --> 10:04.190
In case he comes back.

10:25.146 --> 10:26.212
Hello?

10:27.281 --> 10:28.280
Down here!

10:29.450 --> 10:31.150
Fight!

10:31.185 --> 10:34.053
Oh!

10:35.490 --> 10:36.989
Dude.

10:38.159 --> 10:39.425
What happened at work today?

10:42.396 --> 10:44.029
Dad was here, wasn't he?

10:44.065 --> 10:45.097
Yeah.

10:45.133 --> 10:49.101
He said he wanted
to talk about the "incident."

10:51.038 --> 10:52.371
It's his words, not mine.

10:53.474 --> 10:55.374
The air quotes were mine.

10:55.409 --> 10:58.077
- How upset was he?
- It's hard to say.

11:04.051 --> 11:05.351
How bad?

11:05.386 --> 11:08.287
I accidentally fired up
the engine on a Cessna 150.

11:09.323 --> 11:11.157
- Doesn't sound so bad.
- It came loose

11:11.192 --> 11:13.058
and almost turned me
into hamburger helper.

11:13.094 --> 11:15.394
Huh. What are you gonna do?

11:15.429 --> 11:17.963
I...

11:17.999 --> 11:19.365
I don't know.

11:21.002 --> 11:22.401
I'm probably gonna get fired.

11:22.436 --> 11:24.170
Oh, come on.

11:24.205 --> 11:26.372
Okay, Dad would never let that happen.

11:28.042 --> 11:29.975
Although, you may want
to start lookin' for a job

11:30.011 --> 11:32.044
that doesn't have as many sharp objects.

11:32.079 --> 11:33.078
Ow!

11:37.451 --> 11:41.020
Uh... Yeah, Riley was here.

11:42.290 --> 11:44.356
We, uh, made up.

11:44.392 --> 11:46.091
Right here on the couch?

11:46.127 --> 11:47.459
Gross, Luke!

11:50.398 --> 11:52.198
I thought you and Riley were done.

11:52.233 --> 11:54.200
Yeah, well, somebody
stole something from her.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.268
And I'm helpin' her out.

11:56.304 --> 11:57.336
Why?

11:58.439 --> 12:01.173
Because that's what people do?

12:01.209 --> 12:02.408
They help each other out?

12:02.443 --> 12:04.210
You don't think I help people?

12:05.346 --> 12:07.313
I help people!

12:07.348 --> 12:09.315
Steven at the warehouse? Saved his life!

12:09.350 --> 12:11.183
Yeah, from an accident you caused...

12:11.219 --> 12:14.053
No, no. Luke, see,
this is why we're so different.

12:14.088 --> 12:16.021
You're always looking
at the glass half-empty.

12:16.057 --> 12:19.091
No, I'm looking at the glass, and
wondering why we're not using the water

12:19.126 --> 12:20.192
to put out the fire.

12:20.228 --> 12:22.328
- What fire?
- Mine, for starters.

12:22.363 --> 12:23.429
You mean Riley's.

12:23.464 --> 12:27.166
She got mixed up with a bad dude, okay?

12:27.201 --> 12:30.069
And she was gonna
go out there by herself.

12:30.104 --> 12:31.270
I can't let her do that.

12:31.305 --> 12:34.440
So, you want me to beat
up a dude I don't know

12:34.475 --> 12:36.175
for a girl you don't like?

12:36.210 --> 12:38.244
I just want you to have my back.

12:38.279 --> 12:42.281
I know you want to hold on
to this normal life.

12:42.316 --> 12:45.184
But this normal life
is kicking your ass.

12:45.219 --> 12:47.453
And not everyone has the choice
between, you know, cutting boxes

12:47.488 --> 12:49.255
and saving lives, but you do.

12:49.290 --> 12:52.992
Look, Luke. I want to help you.

12:53.027 --> 12:58.063
But Riley ruined your life once,
I know she's gonna do it again.

12:58.099 --> 13:01.934
I'm sorry, I can't help you, and I
really hope you won't help her, either.

13:01.969 --> 13:04.270
Yeah, that's the real difference
between me and you.

13:05.373 --> 13:06.939
What's that?

13:06.974 --> 13:08.941
You cut boxes.

13:08.976 --> 13:10.075
I help people.

13:22.990 --> 13:24.990
- Thanks, Jo.
- Mm-hmm.

13:25.026 --> 13:27.159
Oh, and some Dijon mustard
when you get a sec.

13:27.194 --> 13:29.261
And if not Dijon, then spicy brown.

13:29.297 --> 13:33.098
Or whole grain. Oh, wait.
Whole grain and then spicy brown...

13:33.134 --> 13:36.168
- What can I do for you?
- Oh. Straight to the point.

13:36.203 --> 13:39.338
I like it. I heard about your run-in
with Ian Brockman.

13:39.373 --> 13:40.439
Diane told you.

13:40.474 --> 13:43.042
You're fired up. I don't blame you.

13:43.077 --> 13:45.110
But your temper is a threat
to my investigation.

13:45.146 --> 13:46.645
That guy's a threat to my family.

13:46.681 --> 13:48.789
And I assure you, we are
doing everything

13:48.789 --> 13:50.417
that we can to nab these guys.

13:50.418 --> 13:52.523
- Oh, thank you.
- You called me all the way

13:52.523 --> 13:54.386
out here to tell me to
stay away from Pastor Ian?

13:54.422 --> 13:56.355
'Cause Diane already
gave me that speech.

13:56.390 --> 13:59.191
Oh, right. Diane.

14:00.962 --> 14:02.995
Are you close with the Matthews family?

14:05.967 --> 14:08.968
What about the son?
Holden, are you close to him?

14:09.003 --> 14:10.069
We're friends.

14:11.238 --> 14:13.105
Did he ever talk to you
about Hollow Sky?

14:13.140 --> 14:14.206
Nope.

14:15.276 --> 14:17.977
Did he ever mention anybody
named Isaac Frost?

14:20.014 --> 14:21.347
What about Tess Shoemacher?

14:23.284 --> 14:24.483
Never heard of her.

14:24.518 --> 14:29.021
Listen, Holden is just a regular
guy tryin' to live his life.

14:29.056 --> 14:31.023
You're barkin' up the wrong tree.

14:33.327 --> 14:34.393
Who do all of these names

14:34.428 --> 14:36.195
have in common?

14:38.132 --> 14:42.001
Mr. "Regular Guy"

14:42.036 --> 14:45.270
Holden Matthews.

14:47.375 --> 14:49.441
Now, I'm wondering if you can tell me,

14:49.477 --> 14:52.011
why he is in the center

14:52.046 --> 14:54.079
of my Hollow Sky investigation?

14:56.283 --> 14:58.317
You know, it never sat right with me,

14:58.352 --> 15:01.387
the way you FBI types fight your
battles from behind a desk.

15:03.224 --> 15:06.959
Now it seems like you fight your
battles from behind a cheeseburger.

15:08.162 --> 15:09.928
I'm trying to help you.

15:09.964 --> 15:11.296
I'm trying to help Christine.

15:11.332 --> 15:15.234
- Like I said, Holden's just a...
- Regular guy, yeah.

15:15.269 --> 15:17.136
Okay. Here.

15:17.171 --> 15:19.271
Anything comes to mind, give me a call.

15:19.306 --> 15:21.407
Or a text. Whatever.

15:21.442 --> 15:23.008
Right.

15:25.012 --> 15:26.045
Liar.

15:30.559 --> 15:32.680
I just feel awful about what
happened with Jeff.

15:33.530 --> 15:36.631
It was violent, and you
shouldn't have seen it.

15:36.666 --> 15:38.466
He was just upset about Kevin.

15:39.636 --> 15:42.303
People handle grief differently.

15:43.707 --> 15:46.274
How are things between you and Tom?

15:47.477 --> 15:50.311
We're still separated,
if that's what you're asking.

15:50.347 --> 15:51.846
It is.

15:51.882 --> 15:53.728
Well, I certainly wouldn't
be having lunch with you

15:53.728 --> 15:54.750
if we were back together.

15:54.751 --> 15:57.485
Well, there's nothing wrong with two
friends having a meal together.

15:59.322 --> 16:00.588
Is that what we are?

16:01.691 --> 16:03.291
Friends?

16:11.301 --> 16:14.335
I don't know what it is, but I just
feel better when I'm with you.

16:16.406 --> 16:17.672
What's your secret?

16:20.610 --> 16:24.345
Well, hopefully someday soon,
it won't be much of a secret at all.

16:25.382 --> 16:26.714
You mean Hollow Sky.

16:29.286 --> 16:31.453
It's okay, you can tell me.

16:31.488 --> 16:33.455
I promise I'll keep an open mind.

16:35.659 --> 16:36.658
I'm glad.

16:39.763 --> 16:41.529
Now, there's a lot
that I can't talk about.

16:41.565 --> 16:43.498
It's not because it's bad or dangerous,

16:43.533 --> 16:45.600
only because they're still
working on the technology.

16:45.635 --> 16:47.635
What kind of technology?

16:47.671 --> 16:49.504
The kind that'll change the world.

16:51.475 --> 16:54.642
Change how people, the living
and those who have passed on,

16:54.678 --> 16:57.479
experience the afterlife.

16:57.514 --> 17:02.350
It will keep us connected to our loved
ones long after their deaths.

17:02.385 --> 17:06.654
So death will no longer
be death, but rather travel.

17:09.291 --> 17:10.358
That sounds...

17:10.393 --> 17:11.659
- Crazy.
- Yes.

17:14.631 --> 17:18.299
Maybe it's one of those things
I need to see to believe.

17:22.506 --> 17:24.606
Let me see if I can pull some strings.

17:24.641 --> 17:26.406
Maybe get you a tour of headquarters.

17:26.443 --> 17:27.474
If you're interested.

17:27.511 --> 17:29.377
Could you really do that?

17:29.412 --> 17:31.279
Let me see what I can do.

17:39.623 --> 17:41.656
Relax your shoulders.

17:43.660 --> 17:45.660
Just tryin' to help.

17:45.695 --> 17:47.428
I didn't ask for your help.

17:47.464 --> 17:49.631
Could be you keep missin'
'cause something's got you tense.

17:54.471 --> 17:55.737
Yeah, could be.

17:57.374 --> 17:58.506
Stop thinking.

18:00.377 --> 18:02.343
How the hell do I do that?

18:02.379 --> 18:03.645
Empty out and I'll show you.

18:07.584 --> 18:10.552
Now ain't that the best
moonshine you ever tasted?

18:10.587 --> 18:12.453
That's disgusting.

18:12.489 --> 18:14.689
That's a family recipe
you're talkin' about.

18:14.724 --> 18:16.424
Give me one more.

18:20.630 --> 18:22.463
I've never seen you before.

18:22.499 --> 18:23.698
I'm not from here.

18:23.733 --> 18:26.467
Oh, mysterious.

18:27.804 --> 18:31.573
Not really, I just, um, I just kind
of grew up all over the place.

18:31.608 --> 18:34.509
Oh. Come to Fort Reed
to practice your shot?

18:34.544 --> 18:36.411
And drink moonshine with strangers.

18:36.446 --> 18:38.613
What are you practicing for?

18:38.648 --> 18:41.282
I'm thinking about killing someone.

18:41.318 --> 18:43.551
All right. Who you gonna kill?

18:43.587 --> 18:46.521
Some old guy. He's like 102.

18:46.556 --> 18:49.457
What did this poor old fella do to you?

18:49.492 --> 18:52.327
Oh, some fun stuff. Like, for instance,

18:52.362 --> 18:56.531
he... he kidnapped me,
and held me hostage

18:56.566 --> 19:01.202
in a strange place for way
longer than I wanted.

19:04.240 --> 19:07.408
This still a joke? It's startin'
to feel kind of real.

19:08.478 --> 19:10.244
Guess you'll never know.

19:16.620 --> 19:18.519
You're still tense.

19:21.257 --> 19:23.458
All right. Breathe.

19:25.328 --> 19:27.328
Relax.

19:27.364 --> 19:29.530
You're on that target.

19:29.566 --> 19:31.633
You got anything
goes down a little smoother?

19:34.738 --> 19:36.537
Is he okay?

19:36.573 --> 19:39.540
He's okay. A little
disoriented, but not hurt.

19:39.576 --> 19:40.708
Is he under arrest?

19:40.744 --> 19:42.677
The owners of the house
declined to press charges.

19:42.712 --> 19:43.761
For what?

19:43.761 --> 19:46.714
They came home and found your
grandfather digging up the backyard.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.317
When they tried to approach,
he got hostile.

19:49.352 --> 19:52.320
He said it was, uh,
his house and to get away.

19:52.355 --> 19:54.656
He's been having some problems
with his memory.

19:54.691 --> 19:57.358
Be wise to keep a better eye on him.

19:57.394 --> 19:59.260
It only gets worse.

20:01.464 --> 20:02.664
Can I take him home?

20:07.570 --> 20:09.537
I was so worried.

20:09.572 --> 20:11.539
Don't be.

20:11.574 --> 20:12.740
Thank you, Officer.

20:15.345 --> 20:17.378
Look what I found, Willa.

20:17.414 --> 20:18.780
I don't know what that is.

20:18.815 --> 20:22.750
Somewhere inside this notebook is a
secret to fixing the machine.

20:22.786 --> 20:24.752
It was buried for 30 years.

20:24.788 --> 20:27.288
But I never forgot.

20:28.525 --> 20:29.524
Let's go home.

20:29.559 --> 20:34.462
$513,000 in damages.

20:34.497 --> 20:38.566
Five, one, three, zero, zero... zero.

20:40.503 --> 20:42.704
Now who's gonna tell me
what the hell happened?

20:45.542 --> 20:46.607
Ask him.

20:49.512 --> 20:52.680
I'm... sorry?

20:52.716 --> 20:56.784
- That's all you have to say?
- Hey. You were in charge.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.553
You had the keys, the alarm code.

20:58.588 --> 21:01.289
You been ridin' Holden's ass
since the day he was promoted.

21:01.324 --> 21:02.690
Stevie had nothing to do with it.

21:04.494 --> 21:06.327
I got mad.

21:07.363 --> 21:10.531
I lost control and I
messed the place up.

21:10.567 --> 21:11.599
I'm sorry.

21:13.303 --> 21:15.737
You got mad and destroyed half a
million dollars worth of property?

21:15.772 --> 21:18.306
Plus 13,000 for that propeller.

21:18.341 --> 21:19.373
Stevie.

21:19.409 --> 21:21.476
Somebody better give me an answer.

21:21.511 --> 21:23.311
Or I'm cuttin' both your pay.

21:23.346 --> 21:25.413
That won't be necessary.

21:25.448 --> 21:26.681
I quit.

21:32.355 --> 21:34.655
You mind if we have the
room for a minute?

21:41.498 --> 21:42.497
Sit down.

21:52.475 --> 21:53.708
What are you doing?

21:53.743 --> 21:56.444
Dad, I'm sorry. It's just...

21:56.479 --> 21:58.312
Just, nothing. You screwed up,

21:58.348 --> 22:00.281
so take responsibility for it.

22:00.316 --> 22:02.517
It's over half a million dollars.

22:02.552 --> 22:05.353
Come on, Holden, nobody
believes you did all this.

22:05.388 --> 22:08.489
Besides, the insurance will cover most,
but you can work the rest off.

22:10.393 --> 22:12.527
What is really goin' on with you?

22:15.598 --> 22:18.466
I'm... not cut out for this work.

22:18.501 --> 22:21.502
Come on. I've seen you reconfigure
a lawn mower engine

22:21.538 --> 22:22.603
to power a 10-speed.

22:22.639 --> 22:24.672
And now I'm doing data entry.

22:25.775 --> 22:28.709
All right, so...
you want a different department?

22:28.745 --> 22:31.445
Do you want to work the floor?
Because I can make that happen.

22:31.481 --> 22:33.714
- Dad, you don't understand.
- You're right. I don't.

22:33.750 --> 22:35.316
I don't understand.

22:36.386 --> 22:38.553
Something is going on with you.
What is it?

22:40.390 --> 22:41.455
Just tell me what it is you want.

22:41.491 --> 22:44.292
I want to clear out
my locker and go home.

22:44.327 --> 22:46.360
I don't know why
you're making this so hard.

22:46.396 --> 22:48.596
Because I'm your father.

22:48.631 --> 22:50.786
I don't want to see you
make a decision that you're

22:50.786 --> 22:54.402
gonna regret down the road.
Do you understand that?

22:54.437 --> 22:55.603
I'm trying to help you.

22:55.638 --> 22:56.704
I never asked you to!

23:05.515 --> 23:06.547
No.

23:08.551 --> 23:09.617
You didn't.

23:14.557 --> 23:17.458
I expected so much more
from you, Holden.

23:18.494 --> 23:21.596
Yeah, well... so did I.

23:24.300 --> 23:26.634
You can clean out your locker and go.

24:08.826 --> 24:11.116
There he is! You're early, buddy.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.181
How are you, Richard?

24:12.217 --> 24:13.416
Better now that you're here.

24:14.452 --> 24:16.085
Come on in.

24:19.190 --> 24:20.289
What's on the grill?

24:20.325 --> 24:22.358
Brats and burgers.

24:22.393 --> 24:24.327
I hope you're hungry, partner.

24:24.362 --> 24:26.229
What you got there?

24:26.264 --> 24:30.299
Scotch for us and a... doll for Maddy.

24:30.335 --> 24:32.368
- Is she here?
- No, they're at the water park.

24:32.403 --> 24:35.404
I got the whole place to myself
all day, isn't that somethin'?

24:38.476 --> 24:41.210
Why don't you pop that open
and pour us a couple?

24:53.324 --> 24:55.057
How have you been?

24:56.161 --> 24:57.426
Can't complain.

24:57.462 --> 24:58.528
Work's good.

25:00.398 --> 25:02.465
Closed on my cabin up north.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.200
Kansas City's winnin'.

25:06.237 --> 25:07.370
Did you listen to the game
on the way up?

25:07.405 --> 25:10.306
I stopped following football
when Emily arrived.

25:10.341 --> 25:12.108
But I was never really much of a fan.

25:12.143 --> 25:14.210
Give up your man card,
there's no gettin' it back.

25:14.245 --> 25:17.113
Doesn't matter how hard they hit,
they're still grown men in tights.

25:19.317 --> 25:21.117
I'll bet you never miss a school play

25:21.152 --> 25:23.219
or one of the parent-teachers
meetings, do you?

25:24.556 --> 25:27.323
My daughter starred in Little Red
Riding Hood this past fall,

25:27.358 --> 25:29.458
and she was spectacular.

25:30.562 --> 25:32.195
Is that right?

25:32.230 --> 25:34.463
Maddy did that play.
She played the wolf.

25:36.100 --> 25:37.099
You know what I never understood?

25:37.135 --> 25:39.068
How it took sweet Little Red Riding Hood

25:39.103 --> 25:41.789
so damn long to figure out
that there was a friggin' wolf

25:41.789 --> 25:43.813
right there in her granny's bed!

25:44.242 --> 25:47.310
Dressed in her granny's clothes
just waitin' to rip her apart.

25:49.447 --> 25:51.480
What a stupid bitch.

25:57.388 --> 25:59.622
You're really gonna pretend
you have no idea

25:59.622 --> 26:01.646
why I called you up here today?

26:02.360 --> 26:04.994
I have my suspicions.

26:05.029 --> 26:08.064
We've been friends for 20 years,
and I'm inclined to hope for the best.

26:08.099 --> 26:09.098
Yeah.

26:14.339 --> 26:16.105
I was wrong.

26:16.140 --> 26:19.442
Now you see, that's
your problem right there.

26:19.477 --> 26:23.112
You can't separate personal
from professional.

26:23.147 --> 26:24.413
Well, sure, I'm your friend,

26:24.449 --> 26:27.416
but that's not gonna stop me
from killin' you.

26:28.453 --> 26:31.020
Because that's my job.

26:34.259 --> 26:35.324
Shoemacher.

26:37.161 --> 26:40.229
You robbed her house. What did you
think was gonna happen?

26:40.265 --> 26:43.032
I mean, don't get me wrong,
this makes me sick.

26:44.235 --> 26:48.104
Sick in my belly,
deep down in my belly sick.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.174
I'm not a monster.

26:53.311 --> 26:55.511
We had some times
over the years, didn't we?

26:58.283 --> 27:02.018
Damn it, man. You screwed up.

27:02.053 --> 27:03.419
You really screwed up.

27:03.454 --> 27:05.388
Don't you want to know what
I found in Shoemacher's safe?

27:05.423 --> 27:08.024
There are chemotherapy pills,
she's got cancer.

27:08.059 --> 27:09.358
What business is that of yours?

27:09.394 --> 27:13.362
Mine? None. Hollow Sky shareholders?

27:15.500 --> 27:18.267
They put a lot of capital in Shoemacher.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.369
And Shoemacher stock is plummeting.

27:20.405 --> 27:23.272
So what? You a shareholder?

27:23.308 --> 27:25.207
I'm a believer.

27:25.243 --> 27:27.276
Hollow Sky's an important organization.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.377
It means a lot to me.

27:28.413 --> 27:30.212
You know what means somethin'?

27:30.248 --> 27:32.214
Cashed checks.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.283
We get a phone call,
we take a phone call.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.285
We don't ask about the phone call.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.487
We don't meddle in the boss's business.

27:38.523 --> 27:43.459
We take orders.
Nobody cares what you think.

27:43.494 --> 27:46.062
They care what you do.

27:46.097 --> 27:50.132
And right now, you're not doin' so good.

27:53.204 --> 27:55.404
Now, who else knows
about our friend Shoemacher?

28:02.413 --> 28:05.348
Either you tell me
or I get Emily to tell me.

28:11.122 --> 28:12.455
Aah!

28:16.027 --> 28:18.160
You made me waste my bullet.

28:34.178 --> 28:36.212
Aw, who taught you that one?

28:36.247 --> 28:37.380
You did.

28:46.157 --> 28:48.391
What? You thought it'd be easy?

29:04.075 --> 29:07.043
Easy, easy, you son of a bitch!

30:07.505 --> 30:09.238
Unbelievable!

30:12.310 --> 30:14.343
Made me waste my yo-yo.

30:26.281 --> 30:27.464
It was below zero

30:28.653 --> 30:31.654
and about three feet of snow

30:31.689 --> 30:33.589
had piled up the night before.

30:35.660 --> 30:39.795
And, um... you could
barely open the door.

30:44.735 --> 30:47.503
I was four months pregnant.

30:50.441 --> 30:53.676
Just having the weirdest cravings.

30:53.711 --> 30:58.149
Kevin and I had just gone
to the store, and our house

30:58.149 --> 31:02.125
was stocked with food, so we just...

31:03.387 --> 31:08.657
locked ourselves in the house
and... made popcorn

31:08.693 --> 31:14.330
and steak for breakfast
and just watched TV all day.

31:14.365 --> 31:16.699
It was just us, all day.

31:26.610 --> 31:30.312
Christine, thank you
for sharing that memory with us.

31:35.720 --> 31:41.724
Your tears, your pain, your grief...

31:41.759 --> 31:45.661
imagine they were optional,

31:45.696 --> 31:48.430
unnecessary.

31:48.466 --> 31:52.484
Imagine Kevin still
very much alive, waiting for you

31:52.484 --> 31:53.904
to communicate with him.

31:55.573 --> 31:56.705
Like a medium?

31:56.741 --> 32:00.409
No. No. A direct line to Kevin.

32:00.444 --> 32:01.610
Just you and him.

32:01.645 --> 32:04.313
Talking, laughing, being together.

32:05.449 --> 32:08.317
Your loved ones aren't gone.

32:08.352 --> 32:10.486
They've simply relocated.

32:11.789 --> 32:14.423
They're waiting for you to believe.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.460
Thank you for coming.

32:20.564 --> 32:21.597
Hey, Pastor Ian.

32:23.467 --> 32:26.602
- About the other day...
- Water under the bridge, Jeff.

32:26.637 --> 32:29.638
Times like this, emotions
run high, I get it.

32:31.375 --> 32:33.642
I was wrong and I apologize.

32:33.677 --> 32:35.411
I accept.

32:36.647 --> 32:39.481
It's interesting what you're doin' here.

32:39.517 --> 32:40.716
I want to know more.

32:40.751 --> 32:43.519
I know it seems wacky,
but I can promise you,

32:43.554 --> 32:45.788
here, you'll find a new happiness.

32:47.691 --> 32:49.558
I certainly hope you'll come back.

32:49.593 --> 32:50.692
Of course.

32:53.364 --> 32:54.630
So how do I get in?

32:54.665 --> 32:57.466
The keys are buried right behind
that flamingo thing there.

32:57.501 --> 33:00.402
The pills are in a cookie jar,
in the cupboard above the sink.

33:01.605 --> 33:03.705
This guys sounds like a real genius.

33:03.741 --> 33:05.507
Keep your phone on.

33:05.543 --> 33:07.509
Yeah.

33:07.545 --> 33:09.511
This is really cool of you, Luke.

33:09.547 --> 33:10.579
Seriously.

33:12.383 --> 33:14.416
I don't know what I'd do without you.

33:24.361 --> 33:27.463
I'll, um... I'll be right back.

33:27.498 --> 33:28.464
Okay.

34:00.397 --> 34:01.663
Okay.

34:06.403 --> 34:07.669
Oh my God.

34:12.775 --> 34:14.443
Pick up!

34:14.478 --> 34:15.710
Oh, pick up, pick up, Luke!

34:15.746 --> 34:18.447
This is Luke. Leave a message. Peace.

34:25.489 --> 34:26.588
Hey! What the...?

34:39.737 --> 34:42.638
That's what you get,
breakin' into a man's castle!

34:42.672 --> 34:44.339
Now, give me the pills.

34:44.375 --> 34:47.342
They're not yours. You stole them!

34:47.378 --> 34:49.344
The hell they ain't. These are mine.

34:49.380 --> 34:51.547
That skeezer still owes me
from the last batch she ate up.

34:51.581 --> 34:53.715
Oh, yeah? Well, why don't you ask her?

34:55.485 --> 34:57.586
Riley?

34:57.621 --> 34:58.787
Ops.

35:00.658 --> 35:02.357
Sucker for love. Bitch-ass!

35:09.366 --> 35:11.366
Come on, man.

35:11.402 --> 35:14.736
What is this? Eighty-one bucks?

35:14.772 --> 35:20.309
Minus that from 2,000, that's...
Well, you'll figure it out,

35:20.344 --> 35:21.643
'cause that's what you owe me now.

35:21.679 --> 35:23.478
I was just tryin' to help her.

35:23.514 --> 35:25.637
Well, you can help her
pay me back by this time

35:25.637 --> 35:29.685
next week, otherwise... Luke Matthews?

35:29.720 --> 35:34.656
I'm gonna be waitin' outside
1989 Elmwood Road for my payment.

35:56.138 --> 35:57.671
Hey.

36:04.826 --> 36:07.350
Uh, Plains Brew, please?

36:08.297 --> 36:11.065
I don't actually know any other beers.

36:12.168 --> 36:14.234
How was your day?

36:14.270 --> 36:16.370
- I'm glad it's over.
- Yeah. Me too.

36:18.174 --> 36:19.940
I quit my job.

36:19.976 --> 36:21.942
What about your promotion?

36:21.978 --> 36:24.044
It wasn't working out.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.346
Sorry.

36:27.984 --> 36:29.249
Thanks.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.253
Maybe Luke was right,
maybe I am wasting my time

36:33.289 --> 36:35.255
trying to be normal, or whatever.

36:35.291 --> 36:37.257
You're not normal, Holden.

36:37.293 --> 36:42.262
Right, I mean, I'm no hero,
but I can do things no one else can.

36:43.366 --> 36:45.165
Maybe it's finally time
to make good on these...

36:45.201 --> 36:46.300
Powers?

36:48.337 --> 36:50.037
Is that why you quit your job?

36:52.408 --> 36:54.208
I think it might be.

36:55.277 --> 36:57.277
Only I don't know
what I should be doing.

36:59.148 --> 37:01.081
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

37:04.987 --> 37:06.186
Are you okay?

37:08.324 --> 37:10.190
Hey, what's wrong?

37:12.962 --> 37:17.197
Arthur went missing and... I only found
him after he was arrested

37:17.233 --> 37:19.366
for trying to break
into someone's house.

37:19.402 --> 37:21.068
Missing? How...?

37:21.103 --> 37:24.038
Because he probably has Alzheimer's...

37:24.073 --> 37:26.040
or something equally terrible.

37:27.443 --> 37:30.978
He's not well, and I don't
know how to help him.

37:32.281 --> 37:34.214
I just know that he won't be
around for much longer,

37:34.250 --> 37:35.382
and then I'll be alone.

37:37.019 --> 37:38.213
No family.

37:39.221 --> 37:40.387
Just me.

37:42.124 --> 37:46.126
So for now, I'd like to take a
moment to sip my cocktail...

37:46.162 --> 37:48.095
and process my own life problems

37:48.130 --> 37:50.164
before delving into how to solve yours.

37:53.069 --> 37:55.035
Why didn't you tell me?

37:55.071 --> 37:56.136
Because you didn't ask.

37:56.172 --> 37:58.305
Ask what? Hey, Willa, did Arthur
get arrested today?

37:58.340 --> 38:00.974
How about, how are you, Willa?

38:01.010 --> 38:03.911
Last time I saw you, you were running
out for a family emergency.

38:03.946 --> 38:05.079
Is everything okay?

38:05.114 --> 38:06.380
I had no idea you were mad at me.

38:08.117 --> 38:09.383
Neither did I.

38:16.125 --> 38:20.994
I'm sorry, I... I don't know
how to do this.

38:21.030 --> 38:22.229
Being a boyfriend.

38:22.264 --> 38:24.298
Sometimes I think it would be easier

38:24.333 --> 38:27.101
if we were still in the realm.

38:27.136 --> 38:28.368
Yeah, me too.

38:28.404 --> 38:30.404
I knew how to live there.

38:30.439 --> 38:32.973
We both did.

38:33.008 --> 38:36.110
You remember how you felt
your first time in the realm?

38:37.980 --> 38:41.215
I was terrified.

38:41.250 --> 38:44.118
I didn't know where I was
or what was going on.

38:45.221 --> 38:47.321
I didn't know if I was alive or dead.

38:49.358 --> 38:52.292
But somehow we found each other.

38:54.296 --> 38:57.197
And I wasn't alone anymore.

38:57.233 --> 38:59.166
I wasn't afraid.

38:59.201 --> 39:00.901
I wasn't lost.

39:02.338 --> 39:05.239
We had each other...

39:05.274 --> 39:07.174
and together we survived.

39:43.012 --> 39:44.111
Wow!

39:45.347 --> 39:48.382
Oh. Sorry, Mom, did I wake you?

39:48.417 --> 39:51.018
No, no, no. I was just up reading.

39:51.053 --> 39:52.252
Can't sleep?

39:52.288 --> 39:55.122
Think I had too much caffeine.

39:55.157 --> 39:57.024
How was your day?

39:57.059 --> 39:59.393
Same. Fine, uh, whatever.

39:59.428 --> 40:01.061
Uh, you?

40:01.096 --> 40:02.329
Ditto.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.067
Everything okay?

40:07.102 --> 40:10.337
Yeah. I'm just, um, gettin'
some exercise.

40:12.308 --> 40:14.107
Okay.

40:14.143 --> 40:16.243
Well, if you're okay,
I'm gonna head back up.

40:16.278 --> 40:18.011
All right.

40:18.047 --> 40:20.013
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Good night.

40:20.049 --> 40:22.049
- I love you.
- Love you too.

40:23.352 --> 40:24.384
Oh!

40:26.021 --> 40:28.021
You'll never guess who I saw yesterday.

40:36.332 --> 40:40.467
Wait. What is the knock card again?

40:40.502 --> 40:47.107
Oh, um... I... can't remember...

40:53.249 --> 40:55.249
I thought you said you
weren't expecting anybody.

40:55.284 --> 40:56.450
Yeah, I'm not.

40:56.485 --> 40:58.418
Whoa, slow down, Rambo.

40:58.454 --> 41:00.420
Okay? Got this.

41:00.456 --> 41:03.357
- All right.
- It's my room, my gun,

41:03.392 --> 41:05.425
and I'm good and ready.

41:05.461 --> 41:07.394
Well, go get 'em, tiger.

41:24.079 --> 41:25.345
Hey.
