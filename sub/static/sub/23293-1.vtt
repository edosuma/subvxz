WEBVTT

00:06.800 --> 00:08.760
Stop or I’ll shoot!

00:08.880 --> 00:09.720
No!

00:25.200 --> 00:26.400
"My name’s Tokyo.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.800
But when this story started,
that wasn’t my name.

00:33.840 --> 00:34.600
This was me.

00:34.680 --> 00:35.920
SUSPECT'S WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN

00:38.160 --> 00:39.520
And this, the love of my life.

00:39.600 --> 00:40.560
ROBBER GETS SHOT DEAD

00:40.640 --> 00:42.680
The last time I saw him
I left him in a pool of blood

00:42.760 --> 00:43.880
with his eyes open.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.160
We did 15 clean robberies,

00:48.200 --> 00:50.400
but mixing love and work never works.

00:50.680 --> 00:54.440
So, when the security guard shot,
I had to change my job.

00:56.080 --> 00:58.000
From robber to murderer.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.520
And that’s how I started to run away.

01:02.040 --> 01:03.920
Somehow, I was dead too.

01:06.480 --> 01:07.960
Or almost dead.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.600
I had been hidden for 11 days

01:29.080 --> 01:32.080
and my photo wallpapered
police stations all over Spain.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.640
I’d get a 30 years’ sentence.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.160
And I’m really not the type of girl
who likes getting old

01:36.240 --> 01:37.400
in the cell of a prison.

01:39.160 --> 01:40.360
I prefer running away.

01:41.280 --> 01:42.480
Body and soul.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.080
And if I can’t take my body there,

01:46.600 --> 01:48.040
at least let my soul escape."

01:50.920 --> 01:53.680
"I had no time left and there were
important things I had to do.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.400
Just one, really."

02:05.160 --> 02:06.160
Hello?

02:08.360 --> 02:09.200
"Mum?"

02:09.800 --> 02:10.680
Oh, my girl.

02:12.080 --> 02:13.600
"How are you, sweetheart?"

02:15.360 --> 02:16.640
What’s happening?

02:17.120 --> 02:18.360
"Haven’t you seen the news?"

02:19.240 --> 02:20.760
All those things they say about me.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.200
Yes, of course I’ve seen them.

02:26.000 --> 02:26.840
You know what?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.640
I’m thinking about going on a journey.

02:30.720 --> 02:32.480
"I may join a Chinese ship.

02:33.000 --> 02:33.840
As a cook.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.280
Didn’t you say
I couldn’t even make an omelette?

02:36.360 --> 02:37.800
So I’ll learn. What do you think?"

02:38.640 --> 02:40.000
I don’t know, sweetheart.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.080
What if they only eat Chinese food?

02:45.080 --> 02:46.720
What does that journey mean,

02:48.240 --> 02:50.080
"that I won’t see you again?"

02:51.560 --> 02:53.120
Don’t talk nonsense.

02:53.720 --> 02:54.760
Of course you’ll see me.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.960
"I’ll buy you a ticket
so you come to visit me."

02:59.200 --> 03:00.480
Visit you where?

03:01.960 --> 03:02.960
At the cemetery?

03:07.440 --> 03:08.520
Are you alone?

03:10.960 --> 03:12.000
"Mum, are you alone?"

03:12.560 --> 03:13.400
Yes.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.440
"Then go to the street,
as if you went to the market.

03:17.840 --> 03:18.880
I’ll find you."

03:22.280 --> 03:24.880
"And that day,
the day I was going to the slaughterhouse,

03:25.040 --> 03:27.080
my guardian angel appeared.

03:28.360 --> 03:31.200
But you never know for certain
what a guardian angel looks like,

03:31.480 --> 03:34.600
and you’d never imagine
he’d appear in a Seat Ibiza

03:34.680 --> 03:36.120
of 1992."

03:36.200 --> 03:37.960
Excuse me, have you got a minute?

03:39.960 --> 03:40.800
No.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.240
Cooking in a Chinese ship
only has one advantage,

03:51.280 --> 03:53.200
you don’t have to do the washing-up.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.280
"For a moment I thought about the Chinese

03:56.920 --> 03:58.720
and that I hate people who spit."

04:06.200 --> 04:07.840
-Who are you, a policeman?
-Wait, wait.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.760
You’re going to the slaughterhouse,
there’s a squad waiting for you

04:10.840 --> 04:12.480
and they have a car since six days ago...

04:12.800 --> 04:13.800
Why would I believe you?

04:14.960 --> 04:16.520
"And that’s how I met the Professor,

04:17.280 --> 04:19.200
pointing a gun to his balls."

04:19.280 --> 04:20.120
May I?

04:20.320 --> 04:21.920
"The good thing about relationships

04:22.000 --> 04:24.240
is that you finally forget
how they started."

04:24.640 --> 04:25.480
May I?

04:40.560 --> 04:42.240
They’re already in your mother’s house.

04:48.680 --> 04:49.960
That’s why I came to help you.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.600
I want to propose you some business,

04:56.360 --> 04:58.160
a robbery, a robbery that’s...

05:01.280 --> 05:02.120
singular.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.360
I’m looking for people who...

05:06.400 --> 05:08.400
Well, people who don’t have much to lose.

05:11.280 --> 05:12.680
What do you think about...

05:14.000 --> 05:16.440
2,400 million euros?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.240
"Nobody had done a job like that,

05:22.320 --> 05:25.360
neither in New York,
nor in London, nor in Monte Carlo.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.600
So if my picture was again in the papers,

05:27.680 --> 05:30.320
at least it’d be due
to the biggest robbery ever."

06:08.880 --> 06:12.040
WELCOME

06:13.000 --> 06:14.080
I welcome you

06:16.160 --> 06:20.080
and... I thank you
for having accepted this...

06:22.280 --> 06:23.160
this job offer.

06:27.640 --> 06:30.920
We’ll live here,
far from the worldly noise.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.160
Five months, the five months
we’ll spend studying

06:34.240 --> 06:36.840
-how to do the job.
-What do you mean, five months?

06:37.040 --> 06:38.480
Are we crazy?

06:41.240 --> 06:45.080
Look, people spend years studying

06:46.280 --> 06:48.960
to earn a salary,
a salary which, in the best of cases,

06:49.800 --> 06:51.840
is just a salary, a shitty salary.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.480
What are five months?

06:57.520 --> 06:59.040
I’ve been thinking about this...

07:02.240 --> 07:03.480
for much longer.

07:07.520 --> 07:09.240
Not to have to work ever again.

07:10.400 --> 07:11.760
Neither you

07:13.480 --> 07:15.080
nor your children.

07:23.000 --> 07:23.840
Okay.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.880
You don’t know each other yet
and I want it go on like that.

07:26.960 --> 07:30.920
I don’t want any names,
or personal questions,

07:32.760 --> 07:35.080
or, of course, personal relationships.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.840
I want each of you to choose a name,
something simple.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.720
It can be numbers, planets, cities...

07:41.880 --> 07:46.440
-Like "Mister 17, miss 23."
-That’s a wrong start. I can’t

07:46.520 --> 07:49.280
-remember my telephone number.
-That’s why I said that.

07:51.080 --> 07:54.640
-And planets?
-I can be Mars, and he Uranus.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.760
I won’t be Uranus, so forget it.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.560
-What’s the matter with Uranus?
-I don’t like the rhyme.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.800
-It’ll be cities. Cities.
-So cities it is.

08:03.560 --> 08:04.400
Okay.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.720
"That’s why I ended up being Tokyo.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.040
The one looking at my arse is Mr Berlin.

08:10.520 --> 08:11.480
Under arrest warrant.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.000
27 robberies.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.480
Jewelleries, auction houses
and security vans.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.880
His biggest job,
the Champs Elysees, in Paris.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.320
434 diamonds.

08:22.160 --> 08:23.680
He’s like a shark in a swimming pool.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.320
You can swim with him,
but you’re never calm.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.280
And he was the boss
in charge of the assault."

08:29.400 --> 08:31.200
"The one who coughs is Mr Moscow.

08:32.560 --> 08:34.440
The first thing he dug was a mine,
in Asturias.

08:34.520 --> 08:35.640
MOSCOW

08:35.760 --> 08:38.800
Then he understood
that digging upwards he’d go further.

08:38.960 --> 08:42.120
Six fur shops, three clock shops
and the Caja Rural in Avilés.

08:42.960 --> 08:45.720
He uses the thermal lance
and any industrial equipment.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.960
The one sitting
behind Moscow is Denver, his son.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.760
Drugs, teeth, broken ribs.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.280
He’s the king of fights in discos.

08:55.520 --> 08:56.760
Pure hot blood.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.440
In a perfect plan, a time bomb.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.440
Rio. He’s my weakness.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.520
He’s like Mozart, but with computers.

09:08.840 --> 09:12.520
He programmes since he was six and knows
everything about alarms and electronics.

09:12.600 --> 09:15.240
For the rest of things in life
it’s as if he had been born yesterday.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.960
And those are the Siamese twins,
Helsinki and Oslo.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.800
Even the most sophisticated plan
needs soldiers

09:21.960 --> 09:23.400
and who better than two Serbs.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.560
Maybe they think,
but, frankly, we’ll never know.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.000
Nairobi,

09:29.760 --> 09:31.080
a hardened optimist.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.800
She has forged banknotes since she was 13.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.800
And now she’s our quality manager.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.080
She might be crazy,
but she’s really funny."

09:41.240 --> 09:45.640
Think that every day
they’ll talk about us in the news,

09:46.280 --> 09:49.000
every family in the country
will be wondering

09:49.680 --> 09:50.880
what we’re doing.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.920
And you know what they’ll think?

09:57.000 --> 09:59.600
They’ll think: "Bastards!
I wish I had come up with that idea."

09:59.800 --> 10:02.840
"The Professor,
no criminal record, no register.

10:03.160 --> 10:06.120
The last time he renewed his ID he was 19.

10:06.440 --> 10:10.680
To all intents, a ghost,
but a very smart ghost."

10:10.880 --> 10:14.520
We’re not stealing... anybody’s money,

10:16.240 --> 10:18.200
because they’ll even think we’re nice.

10:19.560 --> 10:20.520
And that is vital.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.640
It’s vital we have the public opinion
on our side.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.520
We’re going to be the fucking heroes
of all those people.

10:32.640 --> 10:35.640
But very careful,
because the moment there is

10:35.720 --> 10:38.040
a single drop of blood,
this is very important,

10:38.840 --> 10:40.320
if there’s a single victim,

10:41.520 --> 10:45.240
we’ll stop being Robin Hoods
and we’ll simply become sons of a bitch.

10:46.600 --> 10:47.440
Professor.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.520
Miss Tokyo.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.480
What are we robbing?

11:00.920 --> 11:03.000
The Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.920
DAY OF THE ROBBERY
FRIDAY 8:35 A.M.

12:27.920 --> 12:29.040
Who chose the mask?

12:29.360 --> 12:31.600
-What’s up with the mask?
-It’s not scary.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.560
In bank robbery films the masks are scary.

12:35.240 --> 12:38.240
They’re zombies, skeletons,
the death, I don’t know, you feel...

12:39.880 --> 12:41.000
With a gun in your hand

12:41.080 --> 12:43.120
I assure you a madman
is scarier than a skeleton.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.360
-Stop it.
-Who was this guy with the moustache?

12:47.400 --> 12:50.840
Dalí, son, a Spanish painter.
He was very good.

12:51.240 --> 12:52.920
-A painter.
-Yes.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.720
-A painter of paintings.
-Yes.

12:56.880 --> 13:00.040
Do you know what’s fucking scary?
Dolls for children.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.720
They’re really scary.

13:02.760 --> 13:03.680
What dolls?

13:03.840 --> 13:05.880
Goofy, Pluto, Mickey Mouse, all those.

13:06.040 --> 13:08.560
A mouse with ears is scarier,
that’s what you’re saying?

13:08.640 --> 13:10.600
Yes, arsehole.
Do you want me to wallop you?

13:10.680 --> 13:12.720
-Hey!
-I’m right. Listen to me.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
If a guy at gunpoint
and wearing a Mickey Mouse mask

13:16.080 --> 13:18.360
gets in a place,
the people will think he’s nuts,

13:18.440 --> 13:20.360
there’s going to be a massacre.
Do you know why?

13:20.680 --> 13:22.760
Because guns and children

13:22.880 --> 13:24.760
are two things
you never put together, daddy.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.920
-Am I right or not?
-That way it’d be more dangerous,

13:28.880 --> 13:29.920
more twisted.

13:30.080 --> 13:33.080
So a Jesus Christ mask
would frighten more, he’s more innocent.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.800
They say "It doesn’t suit you,
it’s like Christ with two guns."

13:35.880 --> 13:38.320
-"Like a saint with two guns."
-It doesn’t matter.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.920
"It was obvious
there was a lack of women in the gang."

13:41.480 --> 13:44.520
"A woman can spend two days
choosing shoes for a wedding,

13:45.400 --> 13:48.560
but she’d never use a single minute
to choose masks for a robbery.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.360
Everything we had planned was starting now

14:10.760 --> 14:14.080
and during those fractions of a second
I thought about all the innocent people

14:14.240 --> 14:16.520
whose lives we would stop
in their tracks."

14:26.720 --> 14:27.600
E-80 LOCAL ROAD

14:27.680 --> 14:29.760
"The Professor knew
there was just one way to come

14:29.840 --> 14:31.960
in the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre
with three tonnes

14:32.120 --> 14:34.800
of explosive devices.
It had to be done in the lorry

14:34.880 --> 14:36.720
that entered the building every week

14:36.800 --> 14:39.440
with the new paper money rolls
ready to be printed.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.520
And that was what we were going to do,

14:43.600 --> 14:47.000
getting to the very core,
escorted by the National Police.

14:54.080 --> 14:57.280
In Spain, anything guarded
by two police cars

14:57.360 --> 14:59.520
is something heavily protected."

15:02.240 --> 15:03.960
"But if you inhibit any possibility

15:04.040 --> 15:06.440
for their communication
through the radio or telephone

15:06.520 --> 15:10.400
and if you point two 26-year-old kids
with five assault rifles at their heads,

15:10.560 --> 15:12.120
it doesn’t matter if they have guns,

15:12.200 --> 15:14.360
and they feel just like it’d happen
to any of us."

15:14.520 --> 15:17.200
I said get out of the fucking car!

15:17.960 --> 15:20.600
-"They’re scared shitless."
-You’ll do as I say!

15:20.680 --> 15:22.760
"Courage and heroism have a price,

15:22.840 --> 15:24.800
and it’s greater
than the 1,600 euros a month

15:24.880 --> 15:27.800
-a kid with a uniform gets..."
-Open the lorry, do you hear me?

15:27.960 --> 15:29.160
"...or a lorry driver."

15:29.920 --> 15:31.360
Come on, damn it, open!

15:34.760 --> 15:37.760
"If those men had had their daughter
on the back of the lorry,

15:37.840 --> 15:40.240
they’d never have opened it,
but who cares about

15:40.320 --> 15:42.200
some paper money rolls with a watermark?"

15:45.680 --> 15:47.640
Hurry up, hurry up!

15:48.200 --> 15:50.280
Jeez, man! Come on!

15:53.120 --> 15:54.360
Come on, come on!

15:54.440 --> 15:58.880
Sit down. Now calm down, the three of you,
otherwise, a blow with the rifle.

16:00.840 --> 16:03.480
You’ll drive with a gun in your kidneys.

16:03.560 --> 16:06.080
When you get the radio call
to know if everything’s all right,

16:06.160 --> 16:09.200
you’ll answer coolly,
as if everything ran smoothly.

16:10.000 --> 16:10.840
Am I clear?

16:15.320 --> 16:17.360
"And in the middle of that chaos with guns

16:17.440 --> 16:20.280
I remembered the night before
I had been asked for my hand in marriage

16:20.720 --> 16:22.800
and that I’d have preferred other plans.

16:22.960 --> 16:26.680
But if you think about it,
you never find a good day for a robbery."

16:28.120 --> 16:29.960
Now you know what you have to do.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.160
Don’t take your eyes off the girl.

16:32.720 --> 16:35.120
There can’t be any mistakes, all right?

16:35.200 --> 16:36.760
She’s 17.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.320
I think I can handle her.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.800
Can I sit by your side?

17:26.800 --> 17:27.800
Sure.

17:39.440 --> 17:40.320
Hello.

17:43.000 --> 17:43.840
Hello.

17:49.480 --> 17:50.960
Do you want to go out with me?

17:55.840 --> 17:57.480
Okay. I’m leaving.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.160
No, no.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.120
I don’t have to think about it.

18:05.640 --> 18:06.480
I mean, yes.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.080
"Okay, children, we’ve arrived.

18:39.240 --> 18:41.960
Let’s go straight
to the museum’s hall, where...

18:42.040 --> 18:44.040
Pedro, please, don’t behave like in class.

18:44.120 --> 18:47.000
Let’s go out in an orderly way,
using both doors..."

18:55.760 --> 18:59.080
And this is the façade
of the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.560
The little lamb is coming in.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.040
Perfect.

19:12.520 --> 19:13.800
Berlin, your turn.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.360
And now, be careful what you do.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.200
How are you, Javi? Where’s Rafita?

19:27.680 --> 19:28.840
Shift change.

19:36.920 --> 19:39.560
Very well. Keep calm.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.000
Okay, children, get in.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.320
Slowly.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.760
This is important.
As soon as we get the accreditations...

19:54.800 --> 19:56.840
Keep you accreditations
hanging from your neck.

19:56.920 --> 19:59.480
They must be visible
during the whole visit, okay?

20:13.160 --> 20:14.400
Don’t turn around.

20:15.480 --> 20:18.120
When you’re next to me,
I can’t even breathe.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.000
Well, breathe,

20:20.440 --> 20:23.280
because in nine months
you will really be out of breath.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.360
Go ahead.

20:37.440 --> 20:40.040
Well visible during the whole visit,
children.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.960
The accreditation in your neck.
Lower your voice.

20:51.040 --> 20:53.480
Berlin, the first camera, on your left.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.000
Aren’t you going to say anything?

21:21.160 --> 21:22.960
I tell you I’m pregnant,
and you just keep calm?

21:23.040 --> 21:26.000
What shall I do, call my wife,
tell her to pick up the children

21:26.080 --> 21:28.200
and we all go to celebrate?
For God’s sake!

21:29.800 --> 21:32.680
Go on, go on. Come on.

21:37.520 --> 21:38.800
ACCESS TO SECURITY SYSTEM

21:38.880 --> 21:40.120
Coming in.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.520
Be alert, Tokyo.

21:47.880 --> 21:49.520
ACCESS TO ALARM SYSTEM

21:50.960 --> 21:51.800
Great!

21:52.240 --> 21:54.200
-"Alarms disengaged."
-Now.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.560
Go ahead, come on.

22:01.360 --> 22:03.680
It was you who said yesterday
you’re in a bad situation,

22:03.760 --> 22:07.360
-you can’t stand her, you have problems.
-Problems just like any couple, Mónica,

22:07.440 --> 22:09.560
like any other married couple
with three children,

22:09.640 --> 22:11.080
not that I want to get divorced.

22:21.040 --> 22:25.080
Mónica, I’ve had three children,
all of them with in vitro fertilisation.

22:25.400 --> 22:28.240
I’ve been having sterile intercourses
with my wife for over 20 years

22:28.320 --> 22:29.440
and now you tell me this.

22:30.920 --> 22:33.680
You must be Shiva,
the goddess of fertility.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.280
What are you insinuating?

22:53.480 --> 22:55.680
I didn’t come here
looking for a pension, you know?

22:57.240 --> 22:58.400
Or for a divorce,

22:59.840 --> 23:01.800
and much less for a paternity test.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.000
I thought you loved me.

23:12.440 --> 23:13.280
And...

23:14.840 --> 23:16.320
And I think it’s a nice idea.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.120
Hard to make it fit in our lives, but...

23:24.440 --> 23:25.840
but a wonderful idea.

23:44.480 --> 23:45.320
Listen!

23:46.080 --> 23:48.640
What? Do you want to know
what I’m going to do with your child?

23:49.120 --> 23:51.920
-That’s what you want, right?
-Listen to me, don’t rush.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.200
Don’t move!

23:59.440 --> 24:00.600
Freeze.

24:05.480 --> 24:07.840
Don’t move! Don’t move or I’ll kill you!

24:08.200 --> 24:10.600
-What’s the matter? Do something!
-Stand up! Stand up!

24:11.680 --> 24:12.960
Get out!

24:18.160 --> 24:20.000
"Come on, come on!"

24:20.720 --> 24:22.360
Hurry up! Don’t move!

24:23.360 --> 24:24.960
Come on, come on!

24:25.040 --> 24:26.360
Come on!

24:26.520 --> 24:27.400
Yes, yes!

24:33.720 --> 24:34.640
Fuck!

24:41.120 --> 24:42.480
Come on, come on.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.720
This way. Come on.

24:49.440 --> 24:53.240
And this wonderful staircase,
made of marble and granite...

24:53.320 --> 24:54.240
Don’t move!

24:57.920 --> 24:59.240
Don’t move!

25:05.720 --> 25:07.000
Don’t move! Come on!

25:07.080 --> 25:07.920
Get back!

25:09.280 --> 25:11.880
-Please, don’t!
-Professor, we have a problem.

25:12.840 --> 25:14.080
I can’t see the little lamb.

25:14.440 --> 25:15.840
I can’t fucking see her!

25:16.240 --> 25:20.680
Miss Parker, where have you gone?

25:40.520 --> 25:41.480
Wait.

25:46.680 --> 25:49.720
-Please!
-Let’s go! That way!

25:58.480 --> 26:00.640
Stop. Stop.

26:01.200 --> 26:02.040
Okay.

26:04.280 --> 26:05.240
Okay, okay.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.400
I’m going too fast. I know.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.280
Let’s immortalize this, right?

26:20.200 --> 26:22.120
Let’s take a picture with your phone.

26:22.200 --> 26:22.880
Wait...

26:23.040 --> 26:24.040
Jesus...

26:26.120 --> 26:28.560
Here? It’s a bit seedy, right?

26:28.720 --> 26:30.320
It’s our first day.

26:37.960 --> 26:39.120
You look so pretty.

26:41.320 --> 26:43.680
I can’t find the girl.
I can’t fucking see her.

26:44.040 --> 26:46.280
Open here. Open and look a bit sexy.

26:51.960 --> 26:54.200
It’s your phone.
If you want, you can erase it.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.400
This is for both of us, for you and me.

26:59.360 --> 27:00.600
Come on, come on.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.680
With this photo
you’ll be all the rage on the Internet.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.600
Give me my phone! I said give it to me!

27:22.360 --> 27:24.560
Give me my phone! Give it to me!

27:24.880 --> 27:27.480
Give me the fucking phone!
Give me the phone!

27:27.960 --> 27:29.600
Give me the phone!

27:29.680 --> 27:31.160
Give me the phone!

28:15.720 --> 28:17.000
First of all...

28:19.960 --> 28:21.000
Good morning.

28:26.880 --> 28:28.640
I’m the person who’s in charge.

28:32.680 --> 28:34.520
And, first of all, I want...

28:35.760 --> 28:37.920
to offer my apologies.

28:40.880 --> 28:43.080
Truly, this is not the way
to end the week.

28:43.160 --> 28:44.040
Phone.

28:44.440 --> 28:46.800
But you’re here as hostages.

28:50.400 --> 28:51.400
Phone.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.680
If you obey,
I guarantee you’ll be left alive.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.800
-Name.
-Alison Parker.

28:56.640 --> 28:58.640
-PIN.
-2078.

29:01.720 --> 29:02.800
Phone.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.360
Calm down, calm down.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.240
Calm down.

29:09.400 --> 29:10.240
PIN.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.720
Why do you need the PIN?

29:14.040 --> 29:16.960
Either you tell me the fucking PIN
or I’ll blow you with my rifle butt.

29:17.800 --> 29:18.960
How long are you pregnant for?

29:19.280 --> 29:21.120
Eight months.

29:21.200 --> 29:22.240
Eight months.

29:22.640 --> 29:25.320
-PIN.
-1234.

29:28.280 --> 29:29.880
You look so smart,

29:29.960 --> 29:32.480
but you’ve got that shitty PIN.
What an arsehole. Your name.

29:32.560 --> 29:33.720
-Arturo.
-Arturo what?

29:33.800 --> 29:36.520
-Arturo Román.
-Arturo Román, very well. Arturito.

29:37.360 --> 29:40.560
You’re our safe-conduct here,
so I’m going to protect you.

29:45.240 --> 29:46.040
Hey...

29:49.040 --> 29:51.240
Give me your hands. Let go.

29:51.320 --> 29:53.600
Let go. Let go.

29:57.400 --> 29:58.720
What’s your name?

30:00.800 --> 30:01.840
Ariadna.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.200
Ariadna.

30:06.880 --> 30:08.560
Come with me. Come.

30:08.640 --> 30:09.760
Calm down.

30:10.320 --> 30:11.600
Feel my hands.

30:12.720 --> 30:15.360
-Are they the hands of a monster?
-No, no.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.120
Because I’m not a monster.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.800
I know perfectly how you feel.

30:21.440 --> 30:26.040
The dry mouth, the shortness of breath....
You have to try to calm down. Breathe in.

30:26.120 --> 30:27.320
Breathe in.

30:28.760 --> 30:29.760
Breathe in.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.080
That’s it.
Please, breathe with me, all of you.

30:33.480 --> 30:34.560
Breathe in.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.120
Easy, easy.

30:39.240 --> 30:42.400
Make yourself responsible
for your breathing. Breathe out.

30:43.360 --> 30:46.160
Very well. Very well.

30:51.720 --> 30:53.960
Miss Mónica Gaztambide, please?

30:54.280 --> 30:56.360
Don’t move. Please, don’t move.

30:56.440 --> 30:59.320
-Be quiet.
-I said don’t move.

30:59.400 --> 31:00.360
Be quiet.

31:00.520 --> 31:03.760
Miss Mónica Gaztambide,

31:03.840 --> 31:05.720
would you be so kind as to step forward?

31:09.040 --> 31:10.080
It’s me.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.840
You’re a star, dad!

32:03.200 --> 32:04.720
You’re the best!

32:41.840 --> 32:44.000
You can sleep very well here, dad.

32:44.080 --> 32:46.280
You can sleep grandly here.

32:46.600 --> 32:48.240
Oh! Dad, dad!

32:49.080 --> 32:51.560
Fucking. Here, boom!

32:51.880 --> 32:52.880
Boom, boom...

32:52.960 --> 32:55.840
Come on, stop fooling around
and let’s get to work. Come on, jeez.

32:57.320 --> 32:58.680
This smells fucking great.

32:58.760 --> 33:01.560
It smells better than roast lamb,
dad, that roast lamb.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.640
-Lay down here, jeez.
-Come on, Jesus!

33:03.720 --> 33:06.320
When have you had such a bed?
You didn’t have it in jail.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.760
Have you seen where we are, dad?
We’re the best.

33:09.840 --> 33:12.640
-We’re the best.
-Boy, don’t get this wrong.

33:14.560 --> 33:15.920
We’re very small.

33:18.200 --> 33:19.360
Can you do anything?

33:20.120 --> 33:21.400
Have you ever had a job?

33:21.560 --> 33:24.040
Have you ever left you CV anywhere?

33:24.720 --> 33:26.200
Ah. Come on, jeez.

33:29.880 --> 33:31.040
My CV.

33:32.840 --> 33:34.240
My CV, what for?

33:35.240 --> 33:36.720
To take you out of Alcalá-Meco?

33:48.160 --> 33:50.080
Do you think I feel proud of that?

33:52.320 --> 33:54.760
12 years of my life
coming in and out of prison.

33:55.600 --> 33:56.720
And you know why?

33:57.840 --> 33:58.720
Why?

34:02.520 --> 34:04.360
Because I’m not very smart, son.

34:04.920 --> 34:06.000
And neither are you.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.760
But the brains of this job
is another person.

34:11.560 --> 34:13.800
And if we’re lucky
and you don’t act like an arsehole,

34:13.960 --> 34:15.920
you’ll leave this place
with your life settled.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.280
-I’m not acting like an arsehole.
-Come on, jeez!

34:19.240 --> 34:20.080
Fill them.

34:25.600 --> 34:26.920
I want you to answer the phone

34:27.000 --> 34:28.840
and convince whoever it is
that we are closed

34:28.920 --> 34:31.520
-due to a technical problem. Understood?
-Yes.

34:35.520 --> 34:38.200
I have no choice
but to point at you with a gun.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.360
-Can you feel it?
-Yes.

34:41.360 --> 34:42.200
Good.

34:44.680 --> 34:45.840
Now.

34:53.280 --> 34:55.640
Fábrica Nacional
de Moneda y Timbre, tell me.

34:56.560 --> 34:59.720
No, I’m sorry, I can’t put you
through Arturo right now.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.000
The system is down.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.160
No, I can’t bring him up here.

35:06.160 --> 35:08.000
No, he can’t come here
to pick up the phone.

35:09.960 --> 35:11.200
No, it can’t be.

35:11.680 --> 35:12.800
No, because...

35:15.560 --> 35:18.080
Just because,
I don’t know where he is right now,

35:18.160 --> 35:20.840
I don’t know if he’s in the factory,
in the museum, in the canteen

35:20.920 --> 35:23.400
or wherever he is!
And besides, that’s not my job, miss!

35:30.840 --> 35:34.960
That was a performance worthy of an Oscar,
miss Gaztambide.

35:49.320 --> 35:51.680
"20 minutes after coming in,
we started to wire

35:51.760 --> 35:54.360
the analogue communication system
to talk to the Professor.

35:57.200 --> 36:01.080
Without phones or radio frequency,
with nobody being able to hear us.

36:01.640 --> 36:04.840
We had sealed the doors
and the alarms hadn’t set off.

36:05.120 --> 36:08.160
We were like in a time limbo,
with nobody knowing

36:08.240 --> 36:10.720
we had taken over
the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre.

36:12.520 --> 36:14.480
And in that sweet peace, before the storm,

36:15.080 --> 36:16.520
it just seemed

36:17.960 --> 36:19.200
an ordinary day."

36:33.040 --> 36:34.640
You look handsome, right?

36:56.160 --> 36:57.000
Who is it?

36:57.280 --> 36:58.800
It’s me, let me in.

37:11.080 --> 37:14.440
Rio, man. If the Professor sees us,
he’ll kill us, don’t you know?

37:14.520 --> 37:17.240
I know, I know.
I have to talk to you. Sit down.

37:17.320 --> 37:19.040
-What’s up?
-Sit down, jeez.

37:20.520 --> 37:21.640
What’s up?

37:22.080 --> 37:23.240
Tomorrow’s the robbery.

37:25.120 --> 37:27.240
And we have no fucking idea
what is going to happen.

37:30.240 --> 37:33.440
That’s why I want you to know
I’m serious with you

37:33.600 --> 37:37.840
and I understand perfectly that, well,
that you’re not a child any more and...

37:39.160 --> 37:42.000
and you may be looking for...
a more serious commitment.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.600
That’s why I want to give you something.

37:51.040 --> 37:53.360
I didn’t buy you a ring
because we’re locked up here,

37:53.600 --> 37:56.200
but as soon as I go out
I’ll buy you such a big gem

37:56.280 --> 37:59.080
you’ll need to carry your hand
in a fucking wheelbarrow.

38:00.600 --> 38:01.560
What’s this?

38:03.040 --> 38:05.680
An engagement badge?

38:05.760 --> 38:07.720
Now at least you’ll know my real name.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.880
Right, but we’re not allowed
to know each other’s names.

38:12.240 --> 38:14.000
Well, don’t look at it.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.000
But it’s yours.

38:19.040 --> 38:20.320
How should I tell you this?

38:24.120 --> 38:27.680
Our affair has been very well, okay?
Great.

38:29.200 --> 38:30.880
We have slept together some evenings...

38:31.280 --> 38:35.200
What do you mean, some?
Jeez, all of them. But four or five...

38:36.920 --> 38:40.680
Sincerely, I don’t think
we’re the perfect couple.

38:41.480 --> 38:44.520
-Don’t we fuck well?
-Yes, we do fuck well, wonderfully.

38:44.680 --> 38:45.960
That’s a start, right?

38:46.480 --> 38:49.600
But you need something more
than fucking well to be a couple, right?

38:51.800 --> 38:54.160
Are you saying that because
I’m 12 years younger than you?

38:55.360 --> 38:57.160
I’m going to have
300 million euros, right?

38:57.480 --> 38:59.360
I’m not a child, my life is settled.

38:59.720 --> 39:02.240
-Really, Rio, I wish we had...
-What do you mean with "had"?

39:03.640 --> 39:06.000
There was love. There was, I was there.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.000
There’s another man, right?

39:19.440 --> 39:20.440
Not anymore.

39:22.120 --> 39:23.280
Look, Rio,

39:24.800 --> 39:27.920
when all this is over,
maybe you and I will go to Tahiti

39:28.120 --> 39:31.440
and see if this works, but tomorrow
I only want to think about one thing:

39:32.000 --> 39:32.960
not to get killed.

39:44.480 --> 39:45.520
Rio.

40:21.600 --> 40:23.680
Rio, don’t.

40:24.440 --> 40:25.640
No, no.

40:25.960 --> 40:27.680
You left a phone on.

40:28.640 --> 40:29.920
Well, turn it off.

40:43.440 --> 40:45.240
The vault is open.

40:47.760 --> 40:49.760
Put on your vests and get ready to go out.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.080
As soon as you’re ready,
we’ll activate the alarm.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.640
Berlin, ready to open the doors.

40:57.320 --> 41:01.720
Hostages, for your security,
all of you three steps back!

41:02.600 --> 41:05.080
A little more over here. Very well.

41:05.320 --> 41:07.520
Okay. Everything’s going to be all right.

41:09.880 --> 41:11.240
A little closer.

41:23.920 --> 41:25.040
Calm down.

41:25.960 --> 41:28.880
Calm down. I can see the bags.
They’re full of money.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.840
Now they’ll leave and it’ll be all right.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.400
"There’s a 10-33 at the Fábrica Nacional
de Moneda y Timbre.

41:58.480 --> 42:00.680
Z24 on our way.
We’ll get there in two minutes."

42:00.760 --> 42:01.720
Two minutes.

42:02.280 --> 42:03.480
Two minutes.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.400
-Why did the alarm go off?
-I don’t know.

42:12.640 --> 42:14.720
They’re just standing there,
I don’t understand.

42:14.960 --> 42:17.800
-Why don’t they take the money and leave?
-I don’t know!

42:20.480 --> 42:22.200
One minute, 40 seconds.

42:23.520 --> 42:24.440
One minute...

42:29.880 --> 42:31.120
What’s your name?

42:32.800 --> 42:33.680
Arturo.

42:34.600 --> 42:37.040
-Arturo, right?
-Yes. No, I haven’t seen anything!

42:37.120 --> 42:39.560
I haven’t seen anything, I swear,
I haven’t seen anything!

42:39.640 --> 42:41.800
-Look at me.
-I haven’t seen anything.

42:41.880 --> 42:43.080
Come on, Arturo, look at me.

42:43.520 --> 42:45.560
Look at me, look at me.

42:45.720 --> 42:48.200
Hey, hey, come on.

42:50.840 --> 42:51.680
Hey.

42:54.320 --> 42:55.520
Do you like cinema?

42:59.280 --> 43:00.120
Do you like it?

43:02.160 --> 43:04.960
I’m... I’m a big fan.

43:08.720 --> 43:11.080
Have you realised in horror films

43:11.400 --> 43:14.840
there’s always someone at the beginning,
like this, a nice guy like you,

43:14.920 --> 43:18.160
and you think: "That guy’s going to die",

43:21.800 --> 43:23.360
-and then it happens?
-No...

43:23.680 --> 43:24.960
He always dies.

43:28.840 --> 43:32.440
Arturo, believe me, you’re that guy.

43:35.280 --> 43:37.880
"Z24 to headquarters,
we’ll be there in 30 seconds."

43:37.960 --> 43:38.880
30 seconds.

43:40.560 --> 43:41.680
30 seconds.

43:44.080 --> 43:45.840
"It’s vital that the police"

43:46.000 --> 43:48.560
don’t have the faintest idea
about what we’re doing.

43:50.120 --> 43:52.600
We’ll make them believe
we came in for a robbery,

43:53.120 --> 43:56.400
they caught us by surprise leaving with
the money and everything was fucked up,

43:56.480 --> 43:59.480
we took out the guns, shot point-blank
and we had no choice...

44:00.760 --> 44:01.920
but to go back.

44:04.160 --> 44:06.960
"And then, not having hurt"

44:07.120 --> 44:08.160
anybody,

44:11.000 --> 44:12.160
we get inside.

44:13.920 --> 44:17.160
"Let them think we’re trapped like rats.

44:18.320 --> 44:20.240
Let them think we’re improvising."

44:20.320 --> 44:21.160
Now!

44:22.240 --> 44:24.800
Tokyo! Tokyo, wait, it’s too soon!

44:25.000 --> 44:25.960
Tokyo!

44:28.880 --> 44:33.200
"Go out, throw the money,
shot at the ground and go back.

44:34.880 --> 44:36.800
I’d heard that more than 30 times.

44:39.920 --> 44:41.520
But what the Professor didn’t tell us

44:41.600 --> 44:43.920
is that they would
also shoot point-blank."

44:44.720 --> 44:46.080
Rio, Rio!

44:53.840 --> 44:55.160
Holy shit, man!

45:41.480 --> 45:42.440
Holy shit!

45:42.520 --> 45:45.400
This couldn’t have started
fucking worse, man!

46:05.360 --> 46:06.520
Fuck!

46:08.080 --> 46:10.200
"Urgent support. We need urgent support.

46:10.360 --> 46:12.040
In the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre.

46:12.120 --> 46:15.840
We’ve got hostile gunfire. Officer down.
I repeat, officer down."

46:15.920 --> 46:19.840
"An M16 bullet is fired at 3,510 kph.

46:21.120 --> 46:23.320
It flies faster than the speed of sound.

46:24.920 --> 46:26.760
So if you’re shot in the heart,

46:27.680 --> 46:29.880
you won’t even hear
the bullet that has killed you.

46:31.280 --> 46:33.360
That’s how I knew I had fucked it all up,

46:34.000 --> 46:35.600
in a millisecond

46:36.640 --> 46:38.360
and the same way as usual."
