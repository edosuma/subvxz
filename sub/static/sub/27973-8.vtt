WEBVTT

00:01.121 --> 00:02.001
I love you.

00:03.561 --> 00:05.441
We found this in the house.

00:11.761 --> 00:13.321
The only thing I want is to get home.

00:13.441 --> 00:14.921
They'll detain us immediately.

00:15.121 --> 00:17.401
- Could you hide her?
- At my farm.

00:18.601 --> 00:19.601
It's over.

00:22.761 --> 00:26.601
According to the Atonement Command of the
High Command, 100 citizens of La Rochelle

00:27.041 --> 00:28.601
have been chosen
to be executed in retaliation.

00:31.001 --> 00:34.281
The logbook... nothing has been written
in it since Greenwood's exchange.

00:34.361 --> 00:36.121
So we can still write in it
what happened...

00:36.561 --> 00:38.681
We need fuel. We have to board.

00:39.801 --> 00:42.281
- How much fuel do you have?
- Enough.

00:47.321 --> 00:49.721
Your plan for getting the men
home safely...

00:50.361 --> 00:51.321
you can trust me.

02:28.921 --> 02:30.001
The door is open.

02:32.401 --> 02:33.761
Will they be coming for me as well?

02:34.881 --> 02:35.961
I don't know.

02:36.001 --> 02:39.401
I've come to get Anna.
I'll take her with me.

02:39.601 --> 02:40.521
Where to?

02:41.241 --> 02:42.201
Away from here.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.081
Where she's safe.

02:45.161 --> 02:46.561
A sick Jewish girl

02:46.761 --> 02:48.801
in a country occupied by the Germans?
How are you planning on doing that?

02:49.361 --> 02:51.121
Anna stays here until her father is back.

02:51.601 --> 02:52.641
Her father?

02:54.121 --> 02:55.281
Her father is dead.

02:58.721 --> 03:00.241
Get me the things she really needs.

03:02.401 --> 03:03.401
And I...

03:08.001 --> 03:09.041
Thanks for everything.

04:33.321 --> 04:36.641
Get out. Get out.

04:37.001 --> 04:37.881
Get out.

04:38.121 --> 04:39.001
Move it.

04:43.121 --> 04:44.241
- Get out.
- Fast!

04:49.441 --> 04:50.641
Come on, move it.

04:56.441 --> 04:57.321
Faster.

05:05.001 --> 05:07.321
Write to your family. Last words.

05:17.081 --> 05:20.281
Write to your family. Last words.

05:53.321 --> 05:54.161
Thanks.

06:03.041 --> 06:04.001
Don't move.

06:04.921 --> 06:06.281
It itches like hell.

06:09.841 --> 06:11.761
It's possible that I won't be able
to help you anymore.

06:16.521 --> 06:17.761
The Germans are looking for me.

06:20.401 --> 06:21.361
But they won't get me.

06:22.761 --> 06:23.921
Not alive, anyway.

06:26.561 --> 06:27.801
You've got a gun for me?

06:29.121 --> 06:30.281
I want to help you.

06:34.881 --> 06:37.921
<i>We are on course to our rendezvous point.</i>

06:39.521 --> 06:41.801
<i>The mood of the men is good.</i>

06:41.881 --> 06:42.761
Morale.

06:43.961 --> 06:46.401
Not "mood".
Hoffmann would have said "morale".

06:47.001 --> 06:48.561
The morale of the men is good...

06:49.161 --> 06:50.041
No.

06:50.281 --> 06:52.441
- Excellent.
- Christ. Make up your mind!

06:53.921 --> 06:56.561
The morale of the men is excellent.

06:56.681 --> 06:58.281
The morale...

06:58.841 --> 07:00.961
Think about Tennstedt, that asshole,

07:01.361 --> 07:03.841
saving us all in the end...

07:04.401 --> 07:07.081
Or-- or-- or the mutiny...

07:07.921 --> 07:09.161
Or the ghost ship...

07:09.361 --> 07:13.361
All these things...
no one will believe us. Never.

07:13.921 --> 07:16.401
There are so many stories to tell
when we're back home.

07:21.121 --> 07:24.441
Or when we stood there and Frank
went to every single one of us

07:24.601 --> 07:29.921
with the matches, and we all knew,
"One of us is going to die soon."

07:30.041 --> 07:33.921
- And then there's suddenly Tennstedt...
<i>- Everyone is convinced...</i>

07:35.801 --> 07:37.321
that our new mission

07:38.001 --> 07:39.641
will have a great impact

07:40.121 --> 07:42.161
on the Battle of the Atlantic.

07:57.121 --> 07:58.521
Just like Hoffmann's handwriting.

08:00.201 --> 08:01.081
Impressive.

08:02.241 --> 08:05.841
Learnt it from a guy I used to know.
Fisherman from the Azores...

08:11.121 --> 08:12.801
That's Hoffmann's final entry, right?

08:14.321 --> 08:15.201
What now?

08:16.681 --> 08:17.641
Thanks, Seaman Laudrup.

08:24.761 --> 08:26.721
You're writing from now on, Sir.

08:27.881 --> 08:29.801
We stick to the truth as much as we can.

08:30.001 --> 08:31.441
The men will be able to
remember that best.

08:40.361 --> 08:42.041
CO's log entry,

08:43.801 --> 08:46.161
4th of November 1942:

08:49.001 --> 08:50.881
Captain Hoffmann was severely injured

08:52.041 --> 08:54.361
while taking the American on board

08:55.841 --> 08:58.841
during a cowardly air attack.

09:06.121 --> 09:08.801
He handed the command over to me,
Captain Wrangel,

09:08.921 --> 09:10.961
as the highest-ranking officer on board.

09:12.641 --> 09:16.201
Hoffmann died of his injuries
in his bunk 24 hours after the attack.

09:18.321 --> 09:22.201
CO's log entry, 5th of November 1942.

09:22.881 --> 09:25.721
Torpedo Mechanic Max Haber died
after a depth charge attack

09:26.001 --> 09:28.841
while U-612 was trapped at a great depth.

09:30.321 --> 09:33.321
If our First Watch Officer,
Lieutenant Tennstedt, wouldn't have

09:33.521 --> 09:36.321
sacrificed his life in a heroic action
in the battery room which was contaminated

09:36.441 --> 09:37.601
by chlorine gas,

09:37.961 --> 09:41.241
U-612 and its whole crew
would have been lost.

09:43.961 --> 09:46.561
Damaged saddle tanks and the loss of fuel.

09:46.761 --> 09:48.281
Discovered a Russian cargo freighter.

09:48.961 --> 09:50.121
Gave order to board.

09:50.641 --> 09:52.521
Petty Officer Torpedo Josef Wolf

09:52.601 --> 09:55.161
sacrificed his life
in brave man-to-man combat.

09:56.281 --> 09:59.361
Wounded in battle myself,
I will personally write a report

09:59.561 --> 10:01.401
which will be enclosed
in the log book.

10:03.201 --> 10:05.041
Return according to orders
of Submarine Command.

10:05.841 --> 10:08.841
Estimated arrival in La Rochelle
in 24 hours.

10:10.041 --> 10:12.961
At sea, 10th of November 1942,

10:13.881 --> 10:17.001
Wrangel, Captain and CO.

10:17.841 --> 10:18.761
WAR DIARY

10:21.561 --> 10:23.121
And that's our story.

10:24.161 --> 10:27.361
You only tell what is written in
that log book;

10:28.441 --> 10:29.401
nothing else, to anyone!

10:29.641 --> 10:30.841
No one, got it?

10:32.001 --> 10:35.401
Not your buddies, not your grandma
on her deathbed.

10:37.801 --> 10:39.801
And definitely not the girl who'll only
spread her legs

10:39.881 --> 10:41.121
if you tell her a good story.

10:46.001 --> 10:47.321
This is our pact.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.521
You got that?

10:52.121 --> 10:54.881
- You got that?
- Yes.

10:58.081 --> 10:59.001
Dismissed.

11:17.241 --> 11:18.281
Criminal Inspector.

11:18.441 --> 11:19.521
What's going on?

11:19.681 --> 11:22.641
We were supposed to pick up a certain
Margot Bostal. She's on the list.

11:22.761 --> 11:25.001
- I know. So what?
- She's gone.

11:27.321 --> 11:29.161
And Miss Strasser, her tenant?
Is she home?

11:29.281 --> 11:30.281
The apartment's empty.

11:32.041 --> 11:34.681
Margot Bostal is working at the hospital.
Look for her there.

11:40.641 --> 11:41.561
Scumbag!

11:50.961 --> 11:53.001
How long will it take to get to Marseille?

11:54.121 --> 11:55.081
I don't know.

11:55.601 --> 11:57.121
The bus stops in every single village.

11:57.761 --> 11:59.441
And afterwards I have to go
to my uncle and aunt--

11:59.561 --> 12:00.401
Don't.

12:03.241 --> 12:04.561
It's best if I don't know.

12:30.441 --> 12:31.521
It will work.

12:33.361 --> 12:35.121
Yes. It will work.

13:51.841 --> 13:54.881
To the population: Obey and serve.

14:23.881 --> 14:25.361
You know how all of this started for me?

14:28.641 --> 14:29.881
We were heading back

14:32.881 --> 14:34.601
and, for a short moment,
I got distracted.

14:37.001 --> 14:37.921
By dolphins

14:39.641 --> 14:41.441
bouncing across the surface.

14:44.441 --> 14:45.281
It was...

14:48.081 --> 14:49.161
This elegance...

14:50.801 --> 14:53.801
The beauty of these animals, which were
completely indifferent towards us.

14:57.441 --> 14:58.441
It moved me.

15:02.001 --> 15:03.921
And that's why I didn't notice the plane.

15:05.881 --> 15:07.121
43 men.

15:07.681 --> 15:08.641
Dead.

15:10.881 --> 15:11.921
Comrades.

15:13.561 --> 15:14.521
Friends.

15:16.201 --> 15:17.241
Because of me.

15:22.921 --> 15:24.281
You'll have to live with that.

15:27.321 --> 15:28.361
We all do.

19:53.121 --> 19:59.001
Emile Charpentier has Gluck.

20:20.681 --> 20:21.601
Your papers.

22:00.001 --> 22:01.961
Give me the letters!

22:11.121 --> 22:12.321
I'm sorry, Maurice.

22:14.641 --> 22:16.281
Let's say the Hail Mary.

22:19.121 --> 22:20.361
Hail Mary,

22:21.241 --> 22:22.361
Mother of God,

22:22.961 --> 22:24.321
pray for us sinners now...

22:25.441 --> 22:29.161
Emile Charpentier has Gluck

22:30.241 --> 22:31.601
On the road to Villedoux?

22:32.001 --> 22:33.881
The farm belongs to Georges Charpentier.

22:34.041 --> 22:37.041
But the French say
that his son is living with him.

22:39.241 --> 22:41.001
Get all available men.

22:49.641 --> 22:51.161
Miss Strasser, on duty again?

22:51.801 --> 22:53.761
Stay in the office until I'm back.

23:04.361 --> 23:05.281
Who did that?

23:08.001 --> 23:09.121
Who did that?

23:15.281 --> 23:17.201
My God, what have we become?

23:24.561 --> 23:28.201
I want to know who is responsible
for this brutality?

23:28.721 --> 23:29.641
I am.

23:34.321 --> 23:37.321
I took over command of this boat and
therefore the duties that come with it.

23:38.001 --> 23:39.161
He would have betrayed us.

23:39.921 --> 23:41.321
One life for many.

23:42.081 --> 23:43.881
That's the calculation in times of war.

23:44.321 --> 23:45.561
And if a man

23:46.761 --> 23:48.401
can't keep our secret

23:49.241 --> 23:51.281
what will await these men on their return?

23:53.201 --> 23:54.841
Being put up against a wall

23:55.801 --> 23:56.841
and shot.

24:00.081 --> 24:02.801
Then we really have the CO we deserve.

24:22.841 --> 24:23.761
So?

24:25.081 --> 24:27.081
What are you going to write
in the log book, Sir?

24:28.441 --> 24:29.841
Weak constitution.

24:32.561 --> 24:33.881
He went overboard.

24:35.081 --> 24:36.561
Take care of the sea burial.

24:38.321 --> 24:39.241
Aye.

24:55.801 --> 24:57.001
Play some music.

24:58.521 --> 24:59.401
Something upbeat.

25:00.561 --> 25:01.441
For morale.

25:04.601 --> 25:05.641
That's an order.

25:07.201 --> 25:08.401
Petty Officer Radio.

25:12.561 --> 25:13.761
Aye, Sir.

26:40.401 --> 26:42.521
- Would you like a cup of coffee, Dad?
- Yes, thanks.

27:57.321 --> 27:58.321
Dad!

29:37.441 --> 29:38.321
Ruchaud,

29:39.201 --> 29:40.121
Monot,

29:41.161 --> 29:43.201
Lebrun, Bergis,

29:43.641 --> 29:44.721
Anglade.

29:46.041 --> 29:47.081
Come with us.

30:37.681 --> 30:39.841
We found Gluck. He's alive.

30:40.961 --> 30:41.921
Really?

30:42.721 --> 30:43.721
What about the hostages?

30:44.121 --> 30:45.281
Are being executed as we speak.

30:47.881 --> 30:48.921
Ready!

30:52.561 --> 30:53.961
Aim!

31:01.681 --> 31:02.681
Fire!

31:03.601 --> 31:04.641
I ordered this.

31:05.081 --> 31:08.081
Five hostages are adequate atonement
for the support Monroe must have had

31:08.201 --> 31:09.441
from within the population.

31:10.161 --> 31:12.001
All further executions
have been suspended.

31:15.841 --> 31:17.201
Come with me. We need to talk.

31:43.361 --> 31:44.241
Yes.

31:45.041 --> 31:46.041
Yes.

31:49.761 --> 31:52.521
Adjutant Meinhardt, reporting for duty,
Commander.

31:54.001 --> 31:54.881
Yes.

31:55.121 --> 31:57.241
A U-boat has been sighted returning
to port.

31:57.521 --> 31:59.041
Were we expecting a returnee?

31:59.561 --> 32:01.961
- No, Commander.
- What number?

32:03.321 --> 32:05.001
It's U-612.

32:08.841 --> 32:10.281
Hoffmann's boat.

32:12.041 --> 32:14.641
Patch me through to Lorient immediately.

32:14.761 --> 32:15.641
Aye.

33:12.321 --> 33:13.761
She was betrayed.

33:14.761 --> 33:15.841
And so was I.

33:17.921 --> 33:20.601
Definitely not by those we shot
at the farm.

33:22.881 --> 33:24.681
So there must be somebody else,
on the outside.

33:29.881 --> 33:32.881
I assume that this person
acknowledged the mistake

33:34.881 --> 33:36.921
and is now back on the right side.

33:43.121 --> 33:46.441
Concerning your missing landlady, Margot
Bostal, my people are searching for her.

33:47.921 --> 33:49.321
Maybe she's involved.

33:52.441 --> 33:54.961
Take your time. I expect you to
come to the office later.

36:04.241 --> 36:05.441
Commander Gluck,

36:05.721 --> 36:09.281
Captain Ulrich Wrangel,
reporting the return of U-612.

36:11.401 --> 36:12.281
Wrangel?

36:13.961 --> 36:15.041
Where is Hoffmann?

36:48.241 --> 36:49.441
A secret mission.

36:50.881 --> 36:52.841
A passenger exchange.

36:54.201 --> 36:57.201
A solo engagement with a huge convoy.

36:59.801 --> 37:01.121
That's quite a story.

37:03.801 --> 37:06.801
This secret mission cost many lives.

37:07.401 --> 37:09.441
And you knew the details of the mission?

37:13.001 --> 37:13.841
I

37:14.521 --> 37:17.681
am honored that the Reich places
such a value on me.

37:18.561 --> 37:20.841
Believe me, it wasn't my idea.

37:22.521 --> 37:24.361
We assumed you were all dead.

37:26.161 --> 37:29.321
We were unable to make contact.
The radio was destroyed.

37:30.881 --> 37:32.841
Depth charges. A critical hit.

37:35.241 --> 37:36.601
As stated in the log book.

37:43.441 --> 37:46.321
- Whatever the truth...
- The truth is in front of you.

37:48.681 --> 37:51.801
Would you prefer a tale of betrayal,
death and pain?

37:53.041 --> 37:54.721
Does the Reich have that many heroes left

37:54.841 --> 37:56.921
that you can doubt the truth
of this log book?

37:59.401 --> 38:00.521
The truth

38:01.881 --> 38:03.121
is exactly

38:03.561 --> 38:06.001
as we choose it to be.

38:17.921 --> 38:18.961
Listen,

38:19.681 --> 38:21.361
do you think they'll believe the story?

38:22.601 --> 38:24.001
I don't know.

38:29.361 --> 38:30.401
If they do

38:31.601 --> 38:33.001
I'll get hammered tonight.

38:55.041 --> 38:56.321
I knew this guy once...

38:59.081 --> 39:00.721
who badly wanted to join the Navy.

39:02.401 --> 39:04.161
He did well during the training,

39:05.321 --> 39:07.721
was all set to make Chief Engineer
in five years.

39:09.881 --> 39:12.121
But the older guys he looked up to,

39:13.001 --> 39:14.641
they showed him a few tricks,

39:15.041 --> 39:17.041
a few maintenance short cuts.

39:17.601 --> 39:21.281
Things he knew that weren't right, but he
did them anyway,

39:21.361 --> 39:22.921
just to be one of the boys.

39:25.001 --> 39:26.001
And then, this one time,

39:26.841 --> 39:28.001
before a drill,

39:30.321 --> 39:34.001
he forgot to check on the pressure
of the diesel engine.

39:35.081 --> 39:36.521
And it exploded.

39:37.721 --> 39:39.601
Three men died in the blast.

39:39.801 --> 39:40.881
And this guy?

39:41.601 --> 39:42.681
Is he dead now?

39:44.161 --> 39:45.121
No.

39:47.041 --> 39:48.281
You're looking at him.

39:52.241 --> 39:53.561
If we get out of this,

39:55.121 --> 39:56.201
follow your own path.

39:57.681 --> 40:00.681
Or do you want to end up as a
cook telling war stories?

40:00.881 --> 40:02.881
- No.
- They are coming back.

40:03.841 --> 40:06.401
Form two columns!

40:12.841 --> 40:13.961
At attention!

40:15.801 --> 40:18.801
Report to the CO. Eyes left!

40:25.401 --> 40:26.321
Sir,

40:26.561 --> 40:28.921
crew lined up for inspection.

40:29.081 --> 40:30.001
Fall in.

40:34.921 --> 40:35.841
Gentlemen.

40:37.841 --> 40:41.361
Admiral Dönitz
is thanking you for your loyal service.

40:42.721 --> 40:46.561
And he urges you to enjoy
the well-deserved shore-leave.

40:47.201 --> 40:48.881
Eyes front!

40:53.321 --> 40:54.321
Dismissed!

41:59.001 --> 42:00.241
That's what I thought.

42:04.001 --> 42:04.961
So?

42:05.761 --> 42:07.041
What's your plan?

42:10.041 --> 42:11.321
Do you want to run away from me?

42:17.041 --> 42:18.201
You and Monroe.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.081
Tell me.

42:31.641 --> 42:32.921
I loved her.

42:36.841 --> 42:39.321
While you were forcing yourself on me,

42:40.561 --> 42:42.121
I was thinking of her.

42:43.041 --> 42:46.041
Of her kisses and of her body.

42:46.521 --> 42:48.001
And of her taste.

42:51.961 --> 42:53.161
Does that disgust you?

42:59.601 --> 43:00.521
You won't pull the trigger.

43:03.841 --> 43:07.041
If you do, 200 people are going to
be rounded up and executed.

43:25.841 --> 43:27.881
You dirty, French whore.

43:37.921 --> 43:39.321
As soon as I'm finished with you,

43:39.721 --> 43:41.761
I'll get your brother court-martialed.

43:43.161 --> 43:45.961
They've returned. U-612 has returned.

45:13.161 --> 45:14.361
Every five minutes,

45:14.961 --> 45:18.401
you have to loosen the belt
and then tighten it again.

45:21.521 --> 45:22.641
In case you survive,

45:23.601 --> 45:25.521
you better come up with a good story.

45:26.121 --> 45:28.041
The truth will destroy you.

46:07.001 --> 46:09.681
To the population: obey and serve.

46:52.961 --> 46:54.001
The door is open.

47:56.161 --> 47:57.121
Home leave?

47:57.281 --> 47:59.401
Yes. Pay my wife and kids a visit.

47:59.801 --> 48:00.801
Sounds good.

48:08.001 --> 48:08.921
Good-bye, Chief.

48:09.641 --> 48:10.601
Have a nice evening.

48:14.961 --> 48:16.121
DO NOT FEAR THE RUN

48:24.001 --> 48:24.921
Take care, Chief.

49:49.281 --> 49:51.681
We got away with it, fucking hell.

49:52.561 --> 49:55.561
We got away with it, Frank, and we'll
take the secret to our graves.

49:56.561 --> 49:58.041
You want to know the best part of
the story?

49:58.641 --> 50:00.881
I almost ended up in jail beforehand,
I kid you not.

50:01.041 --> 50:02.921
The Frenchman had my balls.

50:03.801 --> 50:05.521
But I heard a rumor.

50:05.801 --> 50:08.041
I heard about some guys
who wanted to make an exit.

50:09.041 --> 50:12.201
With the help of a doctor who knew
someone forging passports and stuff.

50:13.281 --> 50:15.361
The guy from the police
was very interested.

50:15.441 --> 50:17.081
It was enough to get me out of there.

50:20.521 --> 50:22.601
And after that I sailed out with you guys.

50:22.881 --> 50:26.001
Incredible, right?
I still can't believe it.
