<i>They say people come into
your life for a reason...</i>

00:33.266 --> 00:35.136
<i>But I never bought into all that.</i>

00:35.236 --> 00:37.304
<i>I sure as hell didn't
deserve a good hand,</i>

00:37.404 --> 00:41.673
<i>dealing drugs for my
ex-basketball coach Bobby...</i>

00:42.642 --> 00:47.379
<i>Dumbing down the population
one brain cell at a time...</i>

00:48.648 --> 00:51.049
<i>Though I had my reasons.</i>

00:52.318 --> 00:57.889
<i>For years, I was hung up on a blown-out
knee that ended my basketball career.</i>

00:58.558 --> 01:01.896
<i>Then, along came Mila.</i>

01:01.996 --> 01:05.129
<i>Choosing my bar for
her final night out...</i>

01:05.865 --> 01:08.033
<i>and everything changed.</i>

01:47.974 --> 01:49.441
Not now.

01:51.044 --> 01:54.315
Sadie Ann Hill.

01:54.415 --> 01:57.949
<i>- How do you spell "Ann"?</i>
- A, double N, no E.

01:59.385 --> 02:02.590
<i>- Where were you born?</i>
- New York.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.926
<i>Your parents were convinced
that you'd be a boy.</i>

02:06.026 --> 02:09.229
<i>- They'd chosen a name.</i>
- Thomas.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.331
<i>No, that's incorrect.</i>

02:11.431 --> 02:16.000
My mom liked the name Thomas.
My dad liked the name William.

02:18.037 --> 02:23.310
<i>When you were 11, your parents took
you to the palace of Versailles.</i>

02:23.410 --> 02:24.876
Yeah?

02:25.411 --> 02:27.314
<i>What did you wear that day?</i>

02:27.414 --> 02:30.982
What did I wear? I don't
know what the fuck I wore.

02:32.719 --> 02:35.987
<i>You had a friend accompany you.
What was her name?</i>

02:38.991 --> 02:40.492
Georgia?

02:41.627 --> 02:45.232
<i>Something happened to
Georgia in Versailles.</i>

02:46.132 --> 02:48.299
Didn't it, Sadie?

02:50.737 --> 02:55.774
<i>The correct answer will ensure that
your friends get what they need.</i>

02:56.642 --> 02:58.676
Yeah, something happened to her.

03:02.915 --> 03:04.449
<i>Okay.</i>

03:05.485 --> 03:07.919
I look forward to
seeing you, my dear.

03:14.660 --> 03:17.262
Well, you need a drink?

03:21.834 --> 03:23.968
Hey, hey, hey.

03:29.809 --> 03:32.049
- What happened?
- The guy they want me to screw.

03:32.150 --> 03:34.848
- I know him.
- What? Who is he?

03:34.948 --> 03:37.184
William Spinks.

03:37.684 --> 03:41.121
Oh! I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

03:42.990 --> 03:46.257
Oh, God, I'm sorry. Here.
Do you like shoes?

03:47.593 --> 03:49.997
Okay, you like shoes. Here.

03:50.097 --> 03:52.766
You come in here,
I will give you a free pair.

03:52.866 --> 03:56.403
Okay? I'm sorry.
Drew, are you still there?

03:56.503 --> 03:57.871
<i>You thinking of pulling out?</i>

03:57.971 --> 04:00.974
No, I'm not thinking
of pulling out. I just...

04:01.074 --> 04:06.046
- I just need to think about it, okay?
- Okay, baby. Whatever you say.

04:06.146 --> 04:07.478
All right.

04:10.616 --> 04:12.119
Can I get a drink?

04:12.219 --> 04:14.455
Yeah, I'm not going to be able to
make it to Vegas this weekend.

04:14.555 --> 04:18.255
I got too much to do here. All right?

04:24.197 --> 04:26.133
- He's filming it, isn't he?
- Listen!

04:26.233 --> 04:29.901
And he's going to send a
tape to my dad, isn't he?

04:31.571 --> 04:34.174
I could give two fucks.
I just don't want it to go public.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.544
It's not going public. All right?
He's got a reputation, too.

04:37.644 --> 04:40.914
Okay. But I want a half a mil.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.016
You agreed to 300,000.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.052
Yeah, that's before
I knew who it was.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.955
You didn't tell me I'd be fucking
my dad's business partner.

04:48.055 --> 04:51.158
- And my girlfriend thinks...
- Hey, we said to tell no one!

04:51.258 --> 04:54.661
- Relax. She's not going to say anything.
- Hey. She's the only one you told?

04:54.761 --> 04:58.665
Huh? Is she the only one you told?
And what does your girlfriend think?

04:58.765 --> 05:01.769
She thinks that you need
me more than I need you.

05:01.869 --> 05:05.372
- Don't fuck with us, Sadie.
- Frank.

05:05.672 --> 05:07.372
Frank!

05:11.878 --> 05:13.611
Fuck it.

05:15.248 --> 05:18.018
Okay. All right. All right!

05:18.318 --> 05:20.351
Half a million.

05:21.521 --> 05:26.224
I swear to God, you tell
another soul, you are fucking dead!

06:12.238 --> 06:13.740
Hi.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.306
Hi.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.177
Is Joe there?

06:17.277 --> 06:20.278
No, he's not, unfortunately.

06:24.617 --> 06:27.221
Are you... you here for the...

06:27.321 --> 06:29.354
I'm Holt. Hi.

06:30.356 --> 06:31.825
Lacey.

06:31.925 --> 06:35.426
Yeah, well, you can wait here?

06:38.164 --> 06:41.935
No. If he's not here, he's not here.
I should probably go.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.302
Well, I'm sure he won't be long.

06:54.614 --> 06:59.484
All right, that's it.
That's the last of it.

07:02.822 --> 07:04.689
Good girl.

07:05.358 --> 07:10.661
Your dad did like dogs. He just didn't
know how to pick the fast ones.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.269
We done?

07:16.369 --> 07:20.240
- Say hi to your mom for me.
- We're done.

07:20.340 --> 07:23.844
- You don't go near her again.
- Mom's pride and joy.

07:23.944 --> 07:28.181
- College hero to drug zero.
- Goodbye, Vincent.

07:28.281 --> 07:32.216
Yeah. Come on, girl.

07:42.429 --> 07:45.232
- It's good, right?
- Not bad.

07:45.332 --> 07:47.732
Just the right amount of MSG.

07:51.404 --> 07:53.838
Hey, here comes Frank.

07:58.944 --> 08:00.478
What's he doing?

08:09.422 --> 08:11.858
Did you see who came in that?

08:11.958 --> 08:14.358
That ain't his car.

08:17.196 --> 08:19.633
She drives a gold Camry.

08:19.733 --> 08:24.905
Jules is going to take it to the garage,
and then Lewis will drive your jag.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.639
Crack. Whether you're selling it,
smoking it, no good...

08:30.509 --> 08:31.612
What?

08:31.712 --> 08:34.412
No good comes from fucking crack.

08:36.315 --> 08:38.448
I'm sorry little lady.

08:40.385 --> 08:43.789
This deal is not for us.

08:43.890 --> 08:49.727
What, William Spinks retiring and passing
his Columbian connection not for us?

08:51.764 --> 08:54.501
Anyway. The boat already left.

08:54.601 --> 08:57.204
- What?
- They couldn't wait any longer.

08:57.304 --> 09:00.974
You call Spinks right fuckin' now,
and you tell him, she pulled out.

09:01.074 --> 09:05.646
You think he's gonna let us sell
his coke if she's pulled out?

09:05.946 --> 09:09.216
Willy wanted a Booty
call with Sadie hill,

09:09.316 --> 09:11.418
our connection.

09:11.518 --> 09:15.222
- No Booty? We're fucked.
- Aw, fuck.

09:15.322 --> 09:16.957
We're fucked!

09:20.657 --> 09:22.493
Who is that?

09:24.063 --> 09:27.134
Drew. "How did it go?

09:27.234 --> 09:30.501
- You were supposed to check in."
- That must be that girlfriend.

09:31.036 --> 09:32.604
Relax.

09:34.874 --> 09:39.144
Everything is fine.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.018
He's not picking up. Weird.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.153
He's usually on time, I mean
we arranged to meet here.

09:47.253 --> 09:50.624
Yeah, no, I know. It's not like him,
which is why I can only assume it's...

09:50.724 --> 09:54.294
something's wrong... and I try
not to get into his business.

09:54.394 --> 09:58.398
For legal reasons, too, but from
what I can kind of piece together,

09:58.498 --> 10:02.035
it's something to do with the...
what was he saying the other day?

10:02.135 --> 10:06.440
The supply coming in from the midwest.
Having a hard time getting here.

10:06.540 --> 10:10.844
Probably due to the fact
that it's, you know, illegal.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.947
Who am I to judge?
People can do whatever they want,

10:14.047 --> 10:17.851
and I don't have any issue with
any drugs, that anybody wants to do,

10:17.951 --> 10:21.955
but, it's... the thing I think about,
I think about where it comes from, you know?

10:22.055 --> 10:26.306
I go to the bottom rung, and I think about
the people who are growing it, you know,

10:26.407 --> 10:29.696
these poor peasant farmers in Bogota.
They're not bad people. They're good people,

10:29.796 --> 10:32.733
they're just trying to provide for
their families, but it's very lucrative.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.152
And the government's banned all these
coco plantations, so they come in,

10:35.253 --> 10:38.004
do these raids, and if the farmers
don't have money to pay them off,

10:38.104 --> 10:41.374
they throw them in prison,
and they burn all the crops,

10:41.474 --> 10:45.445
and it takes months to recultivate,
and during that time, who's paying for it?

10:45.545 --> 10:47.514
The kids. The kids whose
fathers are in prison,

10:47.614 --> 10:52.385
whose mothers now taken to drinking
a moonshiney-type palm wine,

10:52.485 --> 10:55.522
so they're alcoholics, they're out of the
picture, and these kids are starving.

10:55.622 --> 10:59.993
And it's a really vicious circle, and I
have a hard time not thinking about it

11:00.093 --> 11:03.029
every time somebody comes
to buy a gram, you know?

11:03.129 --> 11:06.103
They wanna get hopped up on
a Friday night, and I hear...

11:06.204 --> 11:10.868
- I hear kids in Colombia crying,
- I'm sorry for the Colombians, okay?

11:13.272 --> 11:15.876
Yeah. Whoa...

11:15.976 --> 11:19.179
Hey. You okay?

11:19.279 --> 11:21.181
And what are you calling
this show of yours?

11:21.281 --> 11:25.552
- Joe's Grand Cooking Paradis.
- No, no, no, we dropped the "grand".

11:25.652 --> 11:28.789
- Joe's Cooking Paradis.
- Are we sure? It loses something.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.358
Your expectations,
and what's with the paradis?

11:31.458 --> 11:33.093
Why can't you just say paradise?

11:33.193 --> 11:35.128
- People respect the French.
- He's right.

11:35.228 --> 11:38.098
And where are you guys filming
this Martha Stewart shit?

11:38.198 --> 11:40.400
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, how about a little more respect

11:40.500 --> 11:42.068
for our cooking show
aspirations here, pal?

11:42.168 --> 11:43.436
- Thank you, brother.
- Yeah.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.105
Welcome, chef.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.873
- Europe, by the way.
- Expensive.

11:46.973 --> 11:49.042
Yeah, budget's sitting at about 200k.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.378
How are you gonna fund it?
Oh, no, let me guess...

11:51.478 --> 11:55.882
"Proudly brought to you by
Joe's Grand Cocaine paradis."

11:55.982 --> 11:57.117
We dropped the "grand."

11:57.217 --> 12:00.353
Alby's got a guy at the food network.
He says he's interested.

12:00.453 --> 12:04.057
Look, the planet needs a "no vacancy"
sign when it comes to celebrity chefs.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.826
I mean, we got them growing
out of our asses...

12:05.926 --> 12:08.028
Sam, Sam, I'm trying to
turn a new leaf here. Okay?

12:08.128 --> 12:12.432
If you can't stand the heat, don't enjoy
the "all you can eat" perks of my...

12:12.532 --> 12:14.235
Kitchen.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.634
Here you go.

12:25.611 --> 12:27.614
Oh, look at you!

12:27.714 --> 12:32.085
It's so... It's so good to see you.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.452
I know.

12:35.254 --> 12:39.259
Are you sure? About this?

12:39.359 --> 12:41.461
I'm not going through
with chemo again.

12:41.561 --> 12:46.066
And I'm not waiting for
it to slowly claim me.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.132
I'm ready.

12:59.478 --> 13:02.182
You know what they
say about nembutal.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.183
Once you try it, you never look back.

13:08.620 --> 13:12.390
Thank you, my beautiful friend.

13:19.598 --> 13:21.165
Yes.

13:26.572 --> 13:28.472
Now, go.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.856
Hurry up. Get in. Get in. Get in.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.926
Hey, that's Bobby's jag.

13:52.163 --> 13:54.334
Go with the Camry or Bobby.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.567
Let's go with Bobby.

14:30.135 --> 14:31.672
Hello?

14:32.272 --> 14:34.071
You okay in there?

14:35.741 --> 14:38.108
Hey, come on. Open up.

14:43.816 --> 14:47.187
- Help.
- Help? I'm trying...

14:47.287 --> 14:48.752
Stop!

15:04.336 --> 15:06.773
What do you mean, a lookalike?

15:07.273 --> 15:12.712
Well, Willie got his validation,
last time he saw Sadie, she was 11.

15:12.812 --> 15:16.116
So, all we have to
do is find a lookalike,

15:16.216 --> 15:21.188
- give her a tutorial, and move ahead.
- God dammit.

15:22.188 --> 15:25.291
- Well, when'd the coke arrive?
- Thursday.

15:25.391 --> 15:29.062
I don't know, man.
What if Spinks finds out?

15:29.662 --> 15:33.400
Well, I'd rather rot in a landfill,
then in prison, so...

15:33.500 --> 15:37.068
Where the fuck are we
gonna find a lookalike?

16:04.897 --> 16:06.797
Fuck.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.801
You got her?

16:16.408 --> 16:19.179
Hey, man, what if
she's got birthmarks?

16:19.279 --> 16:20.647
What?

16:20.747 --> 16:23.450
What if she's got a mark
on her back or her thigh,

16:23.550 --> 16:25.718
some shit that Spinks knows
about that's gonna trip us up.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.321
I don't know, what if she's
missing a fucking nipple?

16:28.421 --> 16:30.758
You want to count her nipples?

16:31.658 --> 16:35.626
Fuck me! Okay.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.297
Hey, cowboy, come on, help Frank out.

16:59.952 --> 17:02.555
So Joe's your brother?

17:03.655 --> 17:05.224
Half brother.

17:05.325 --> 17:10.396
Yeah, I live in Houston,
so I don't get to see him very often.

17:10.896 --> 17:12.499
Holt's an unusual name.

17:12.598 --> 17:16.603
Holt? Yeah. Well, my mom,

17:16.703 --> 17:21.226
thinks I'm the son of former Australian
prime minister Harold Holt, who,

17:21.327 --> 17:26.679
as far as I know, drowned in '67.
I was born in '82.

17:26.779 --> 17:30.650
I should probably start by
saying my mother is bananas.

17:30.750 --> 17:34.788
Well, sorry if that's above
your head. Clinical term.

17:35.688 --> 17:38.491
I'm sorry, have you heard from Joe?

17:39.291 --> 17:41.461
No. Sorry, no.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.428
- Do you need your fix?
- Wow.

17:45.831 --> 17:48.768
I'm sorry, I know,
I can be really judgmental.

17:48.868 --> 17:52.705
I... I didn't mean that.
It's not you, at all.

17:52.805 --> 17:58.645
I can remove a person
from the lifestyle.

17:58.745 --> 18:02.916
My lifestyle? What about your brother's
lifestyle? He's the one who's dealing.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.718
Yeah, well, he's got really
good reason to do that.

18:05.818 --> 18:09.322
- Well, yeah, I'm sure he does.
- No, he does. He's, he's...

18:09.422 --> 18:12.192
He's bailing out our dad big time.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.825
He needs to make a lot of money.

18:17.496 --> 18:21.935
- Hi, mojitos. I hope you like mojitos.
- Are you shouting?

18:22.035 --> 18:23.903
I told you I can read lips.

18:24.003 --> 18:27.473
All right, of course,
I'm sorry about that.

18:27.573 --> 18:30.245
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

18:32.045 --> 18:37.250
I don't want to sound insensitive,
but you don't sound deaf.

18:37.650 --> 18:41.222
Really? How should deaf people sound?

18:42.322 --> 18:44.424
- Well...
- No, I'm kidding.

18:44.524 --> 18:48.595
- I was deafened three years ago.
- I'm so sorry to hear that.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.863
Oh, rub it in, why don't you?

18:52.999 --> 18:54.634
My voice hasn't changed much,

18:54.734 --> 18:59.372
but over time you can forget
how to pronounce things.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.842
What were you doing
in the men's room?

19:03.042 --> 19:07.447
Someone bumped into me earlier.
I went to adjust my little friend, here,

19:07.547 --> 19:11.417
and I didn't see the sign.

19:11.517 --> 19:13.987
Well, you might be missing a leg,

19:14.087 --> 19:17.790
deaf, and occasionally blind,

19:17.890 --> 19:22.626
but you certainly weren't
shortchanged in the looks department.

19:24.396 --> 19:25.765
The looks department?

19:25.865 --> 19:27.000
- Yeah.
- Really?

19:27.100 --> 19:31.337
- That's as good as you can do?
- I'm sorry, what?

19:31.437 --> 19:32.972
What?

19:33.072 --> 19:35.475
- The looks...
- I'm kidding. Deaf joke.

19:35.575 --> 19:38.878
- I heard you. I have perfect hearing.
- Funny. Funny. You're funny. Ha-ha.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.947
You're so beautiful, oh my
God you're so beautiful,

19:41.047 --> 19:43.283
- what are you saying?
- I'm not... You don't know what I'm saying!

19:43.383 --> 19:45.018
- I'm just say... I was singing...
- I don't appreciate that!

19:45.118 --> 19:48.788
I was... Oh my God, you're so hot.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.023
- A little tickle in my throat.
- Oh.

19:50.123 --> 19:51.924
Smoky. Sometimes I just like to...

19:52.024 --> 19:55.662
- I'm gonna hit you with this.
- No, no, please, stop. That's heavy.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.965
- I've heard it's...
- I know!

19:59.465 --> 20:03.136
Thank you, Julio, thank you.
Coming through.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.738
Hop you around. Sorry. Thank you.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.607
Hey, Dillon, grab us a cab.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.843
A little further.
A bit of a downslope here.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.680
- Hey, sexy leg!
- Whoo!

20:13.780 --> 20:16.716
Very funny.
Pow-pow-pow-pow-pow-pow-pow!

20:16.816 --> 20:20.285
Idiots. Just ignore them. Taxi!

20:23.054 --> 20:27.026
Here we go. All right. Almost there.

20:27.126 --> 20:28.695
- Whoa!
- Oh.

20:28.795 --> 20:31.297
Okay. You okay?

20:32.497 --> 20:33.998
Thank you.

20:44.275 --> 20:49.349
Hey, hey! Wait up a sec!
Hold up! Hey!

20:49.449 --> 20:51.048
Hey!

20:53.818 --> 20:55.854
You forgot your leg.

21:01.459 --> 21:03.095
Night cap?

21:03.595 --> 21:04.929
Yeah.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.971
Not just basketball.
There's football and baseball.

21:12.071 --> 21:14.807
Every sport he touched. Ping-pong!

21:15.507 --> 21:19.112
Except golf. For some reason,
I was always a good golfer.

21:19.212 --> 21:21.414
You lucked out.
That's the sexiest sport there is.

21:21.514 --> 21:22.949
Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's really sexy.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.518
Yeah, there's a lot of
hip movement going on.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.921
You got some putting
and some chipping, right?

21:29.021 --> 21:31.958
Yeah. Yeah. Look at you.

21:32.558 --> 21:35.461
- You don't need it.
- Don't need what?

21:35.561 --> 21:37.897
You don't need the shit.

21:38.197 --> 21:43.103
I'm serious. You... you...
You have so much going for you.

21:43.503 --> 21:47.607
You're gorgeous and you're
funny and you love your job.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.642
- I do not love my job.
- Well...

21:49.742 --> 21:52.478
I love this acting class I
was taking five years ago.

21:52.578 --> 21:56.149
Yeah? What is that?
Why would you not do that?

21:56.749 --> 21:58.885
You can be an actress.
You're so beautiful.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.020
- Shut up.
- You shut up. I'm serious.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.056
Quit all this shit. You can
do whatever you wanna do.

22:04.756 --> 22:08.826
You're way too hot to be
a junkie. You really are.

22:12.597 --> 22:14.398
You're right.

22:15.133 --> 22:16.769
I'm not doing it.

22:16.869 --> 22:19.972
Not me. I'm not doing it.

22:21.472 --> 22:24.577
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

22:24.677 --> 22:28.781
That's great. That's great!
Go with this. What about the deal?

22:28.881 --> 22:32.550
- I'll flush it down the toilet.
- I'll do it right now.

22:42.628 --> 22:44.230
- No, no, wait, wait.
- What, what, what? Sorry, sorry, sorry.

22:44.330 --> 22:46.766
- I just need one second.
- Are you sure?

22:46.866 --> 22:49.101
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Do you want me to wait here?

22:49.201 --> 22:51.469
No, I just need one second.

23:03.815 --> 23:06.116
It's not happening tonight.

23:28.207 --> 23:30.209
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'll be right out.

23:30.309 --> 23:31.844
Okay.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.544
Okay.

23:46.759 --> 23:50.096
Hey, Lacey? I don't think Joe's
gonna give you your money back.

23:50.196 --> 23:52.462
- I really don't care.
- Okay.

25:07.772 --> 25:09.842
Hey, princess.

25:09.942 --> 25:12.209
I don't think so.

25:16.047 --> 25:18.582
- I don't know about this.
- We'll find a girl tonight.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.330
Too tall.

25:31.430 --> 25:35.432
- How about you, sugar tits?
- 5'7" and a half.

25:37.168 --> 25:41.007
Hey, this is the last one, all right?

25:41.107 --> 25:44.977
What about her?
Good face, good match.

25:45.077 --> 25:47.713
Yeah, if we had time for a
goddamned breast reduction.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.019
We need a hooker. That's it.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.820
Way too dumb.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.989
- No, that's a stereotype.
- Fuck, too!

25:57.089 --> 26:00.893
All my years of dealing with hookers,
did you ever meet one like Julia Roberts?

26:00.993 --> 26:02.361
Huh?

26:02.461 --> 26:03.896
I got an idea.

26:03.996 --> 26:06.832
We've got Jade,

26:06.932 --> 26:09.935
Dakota, Madison,

26:10.035 --> 26:11.937
Cindy and Dakota.

26:12.037 --> 26:14.807
Yeah, we don't work the same nights.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.343
Yeah, bitch gets Fridays
'cause she blew Michael.

26:17.443 --> 26:19.445
- Fuck you with your stinky pussy.
- Oh, my God.

26:19.545 --> 26:22.014
You have to cut that shit out 'cause
you got a motherfucking mouth like...

26:22.114 --> 26:24.083
- Girls!
- Shut up!

26:24.183 --> 26:25.685
Dakota number two's great.

26:25.785 --> 26:28.220
- I'm Dakota one.
- This is bullshit.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.690
All right. Thank you, ladies.
The rest of you can split.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.292
Fuck this.

26:32.892 --> 26:35.061
- How tall are you?
- Oh, I'm 5'2" and a half.

26:35.161 --> 26:36.996
Good, good.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.432
So there was a girl who had
the gig, and she can't do it.

26:39.532 --> 26:42.034
So you got the job.
It's a lot of dough.

26:42.134 --> 26:45.304
And, so you know, it's...

26:45.404 --> 26:48.074
They're gonna need you to...

26:48.174 --> 26:50.342
They're gonna need you to...

26:50.442 --> 26:52.409
Need me to what?

26:55.213 --> 26:57.180
We need you to fuck him.

26:57.549 --> 26:59.051
Asshole!

27:01.086 --> 27:02.988
Hey.

27:03.088 --> 27:06.125
Hey, it's not the kind of
request you can prep, okay?

27:06.225 --> 27:08.992
- Jesus.
- What's wrong with you?

27:31.115 --> 27:33.150
Oh, my God.

27:50.235 --> 27:52.272
Hey, Holt!

27:52.972 --> 27:54.804
Hey!

27:55.574 --> 27:57.507
Heading out.

28:07.352 --> 28:08.821
Sorry I have to leave so soon.

28:08.921 --> 28:11.957
I get it. It sucks, but I get it.

28:12.057 --> 28:14.960
I mean, it would've been pretty
weird if Joe came home and...

28:15.060 --> 28:17.896
Yeah, yeah, I didn't even think of that.
You left your purse in there.

28:19.898 --> 28:21.401
Shit.

28:24.370 --> 28:28.305
- I don't want to go.
- I don't want you to go.

28:31.943 --> 28:33.312
- I'm gonna call you.
- Okay.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.012
Okay.

30:01.366 --> 30:03.102
Hi.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.302
Coffee?

30:07.537 --> 30:09.439
Tylenol.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.846
You know what? I don't
think I have any Tylenol.

30:18.782 --> 30:20.083
Coffee.

30:40.038 --> 30:41.340
- Hey.
- <i>Hey.</i>

30:41.440 --> 30:43.275
We're a man down.
You wanna play today?

30:43.375 --> 30:46.411
No, I'm gonna head home.
I thought you were in Vegas.

30:47.011 --> 30:49.112
Nah, I changed my mind.

30:50.748 --> 30:52.850
Well, where are you?

30:54.620 --> 30:56.554
Hello?

30:58.791 --> 31:01.493
Oh, shit. I'm gonna
pay you, brother. I am.

31:01.593 --> 31:05.698
Brother? Yeah!
I know your brother. He paid.

31:05.798 --> 31:08.567
You and your father...
You're both lame!

31:08.667 --> 31:12.705
- Look, this is your last chance, you dig?
- I dig, yeah.

31:12.805 --> 31:15.204
- A hundred grand, Sunday.
- A hundred grand?

31:15.305 --> 31:18.377
- What are you talking about?
- Twenty on the dogs,

31:18.477 --> 31:21.447
fifteen on the ponies,
eight up your nose, the vig,

31:21.547 --> 31:24.550
and you haven't paid in two months!

31:24.650 --> 31:28.153
- That doesn't make a hundred.
- Cut the shit.

31:28.253 --> 31:30.756
I see you at the track,
it's over for you.

31:30.856 --> 31:33.023
- You got that?
- I got it.

31:48.137 --> 31:51.085
I have to go, but...

31:51.886 --> 31:54.010
do you wanna do something tonight?

31:54.747 --> 31:58.517
And, also, I would like to do
something tomorrow night.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.786
And the night after that and...

32:00.886 --> 32:04.490
I wanna make sure I can book
you the night after that, as well.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.658
- Get it in the books.
- I'm sorry.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.461
I should've told you,
but I'm going away.

32:09.561 --> 32:11.661
For how long?

32:20.738 --> 32:22.641
<i>One more, and I'm done.</i>

32:22.741 --> 32:24.476
<i>Yeah, I know, I know.
I actually have the money.</i>

32:24.576 --> 32:26.412
<i>Come on. The money is...
Sixth race, barracuda bay.</i>

32:26.512 --> 32:28.147
<i>I-I-I'll pay you when
I see you. Fuck!</i>

32:28.247 --> 32:32.351
<i>How am I gonna pay you until I see you?
No, seriously, I'll take barracuda bay.</i>

32:32.451 --> 32:34.053
<i>Rich? Rick?</i>

32:34.153 --> 32:35.387
<i>Rich?</i>

32:35.487 --> 32:39.689
<i>Fuck! Fuck!</i>

33:38.916 --> 33:41.453
There's mold all over the house.

33:41.553 --> 33:45.321
You can't even breathe in there.
I really need to get...

33:45.890 --> 33:47.759
No, no, I-I understand that.

33:47.859 --> 33:51.263
I-I can't afford to pay that
whole thing right up front.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.599
I-I just... right.

33:53.699 --> 33:56.868
Okay, listen. I'll have somebody over
here to get in touch with you, all right?

33:57.668 --> 33:59.271
Where the hell were you last night?

33:59.371 --> 34:03.375
We had a surveillance team camped
out all night waiting for your ass.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.177
I told them I was cool.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.813
You told them you were cool?
I told you to get in and get out.

34:07.913 --> 34:10.681
I-I don't know. I don't
know about all of this.

34:10.782 --> 34:15.254
You don't... what... Sweetheart, you were
caught with a significant amount of blow.

34:15.353 --> 34:17.790
If you do not comply,
then these charges...

34:17.889 --> 34:20.626
But I gave you all of that
information about that pill press.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.895
And it was appreciated, but it's
still not gonna exonerate you

34:22.995 --> 34:25.831
- from a potential two-year sentence.
- Surely it's enough to do more for me...

34:25.931 --> 34:28.433
Oh, my God. I put my
ass on the line for you.

34:28.533 --> 34:31.402
You know, everyone at the station,
they think I'm an idiot.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.539
They think you're gonna
screw this whole thing up.

34:33.639 --> 34:37.309
They'll be happy if a pretty young
thing like you gets thrown in jail.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.610
Do you want that?
This is a no-brainer for you.

34:39.710 --> 34:41.612
You know, Joe's not
really that bad of a guy.

34:41.713 --> 34:44.716
He only got into this because
his dad's in a lot of debt.

34:44.815 --> 34:46.368
Listen,

34:47.469 --> 34:49.888
Lacey, you're a very sweet girl.

34:49.987 --> 34:53.725
You're very fucking naive, though.
We all have our problems.

34:53.824 --> 34:57.427
We don't have to become drug
dealers in order to manage them.

35:00.564 --> 35:02.868
Surely there's...

35:02.968 --> 35:05.437
something else...

35:05.537 --> 35:07.336
that I could...

35:08.507 --> 35:10.840
Are you trying to bribe me?

35:12.944 --> 35:17.749
Come on. I've seen your... your finances.
You're almost as broke as I am.

35:17.849 --> 35:20.786
I mean, you couldn't come up with a hundred
bucks, let alone a hundred thousand dollars.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.753
It's really better that you
just stick to the plan.

35:38.903 --> 35:40.470
Hey!

35:41.605 --> 35:44.376
Joey Mulligan! What's up?

35:44.476 --> 35:46.378
- I thought you were headed home.
- No, no.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.348
I gotta talk to you about something.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.650
- You in trouble?
- No.

35:51.750 --> 35:54.686
- Fuck, no.
- Good, 'cause I'm done.

35:54.786 --> 35:58.590
- Yeah? With what?
- With the shit. Debt's clear.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.759
- Are you serious?
- Yep.

36:00.859 --> 36:03.862
Holy shit. That's great.
That's great.

36:03.962 --> 36:06.365
Who's gonna take over?

36:06.465 --> 36:09.034
- I'll talk to you after the game.
- Well, wait. Really quick.

36:09.134 --> 36:10.736
I'll talk to you after the game.

36:10.836 --> 36:14.873
- What's up?
- Joey! Joey! What up?

36:14.973 --> 36:18.310
- Ready to do this?
- Hey.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.646
- Hey. Hey, Joe.
- What are we doing?

36:20.746 --> 36:23.015
- Joe, two seconds.
- Really quick.

36:23.115 --> 36:25.582
- After the game.
- All right.

37:30.813 --> 37:32.548
Hey, Holt!

37:33.484 --> 37:34.555
What are you doing here?

37:34.656 --> 37:37.019
It was Joe's game.
I thought you might be here.

37:37.521 --> 37:40.092
- Right. Right.
- Something wrong?

37:40.192 --> 37:43.395
No. Why? I'm just...

37:43.495 --> 37:46.565
- No. I got a lot of shit to do.
- Right.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.767
I... I'll call you.

37:48.867 --> 37:50.602
Okay.

37:51.202 --> 37:52.769
Okay.

37:54.171 --> 37:56.206
That's what I need.

38:18.229 --> 38:20.396
Hey, Joe.

38:21.732 --> 38:23.467
Hey, Joe.

38:48.025 --> 38:49.127
What's up?

38:49.227 --> 38:51.630
Hey, Joe. How's it going?

38:51.730 --> 38:53.799
No, asshole. I don't
want a midget hooker.

38:53.899 --> 38:56.701
I don't want a bitch that can fire
ping-pong balls outta her bush.

38:56.801 --> 39:01.039
All right? I want her to look exactly like
the picture. Exactly like the picture!

39:01.139 --> 39:02.474
What's up?

39:02.574 --> 39:04.876
Hey. Can we talk?

39:04.976 --> 39:06.945
Yeah, yeah, let's talk about
how to play basketball,

39:07.045 --> 39:09.080
'cause your legend's shrinking, Joey.

39:09.180 --> 39:12.484
- Come on. Hurry up. I got shit to do.
- I need a loan.

39:12.584 --> 39:14.786
A loan? You're outta work
six hours, you're outta cash?

39:14.886 --> 39:17.489
- It's for my cooking show.
- What cooking show?

39:17.589 --> 39:20.559
- The food network wants it, but I...
- No shit?

39:20.659 --> 39:22.928
Okay, one condition... I'm the host.

39:23.628 --> 39:25.464
No, I'm... I'm the host.

39:25.564 --> 39:29.034
Oh, you're the host, I'm the host,
Mike here wants to be a host.

39:29.134 --> 39:32.034
Anybody can boil an egg wants
to be a fucking cooking show host.

39:36.107 --> 39:38.810
I'm just breaking your balls, kid.

39:38.910 --> 39:41.180
Everybody's got a dream?

39:41.680 --> 39:43.512
Hey, come here.

39:44.682 --> 39:47.185
- Don't lose count.
- Yes, sir.

39:47.285 --> 39:49.752
'Cause I'm watching you.

39:50.321 --> 39:51.391
What?

39:52.791 --> 39:56.525
See this girl? She was...
She is an old family friend.

39:57.795 --> 39:59.698
You okay?

39:59.998 --> 40:01.967
Yeah.

40:02.067 --> 40:03.969
She was gonna help me do something.

40:04.369 --> 40:07.973
Now she won't do this thing,
so I gotta find another girl...

40:08.073 --> 40:10.542
A lookalike...
to help me do the thing.

40:10.642 --> 40:14.012
- What's the thing?
- Nothing. She gotta fuck someone.

40:16.112 --> 40:18.884
- Who?
- That don't matter, 'cause this man...

40:18.984 --> 40:22.554
He hasn't seen her for a very long time.
This can work. Can you help me?

40:22.654 --> 40:25.657
- What does the girl get?
- She gets a lot of money.

40:25.758 --> 40:29.025
- How much?
- 300k.

40:30.927 --> 40:35.331
- Why so much?
- To do a good job, keep quiet.

40:35.966 --> 40:39.871
- So you don't want a screamer?
- I don't want a hooker. I want a girl.

40:39.971 --> 40:42.574
Normal girl. You help me
find a suitable girl,

40:42.674 --> 40:45.109
I'm gonna fund that
cooking show, okay?

40:45.209 --> 40:48.713
Now, look, you got
till tomorrow, no longer.

40:48.813 --> 40:51.814
Nobody else is to see
that picture. Got it?

40:53.083 --> 40:55.217
- Okay.
- Okay. My man.

40:55.753 --> 40:59.088
Go. Move your ass!

41:09.066 --> 41:12.304
Yo! Hey, who's that...

41:12.404 --> 41:14.839
That tall guy that kept elbowing you?

41:14.939 --> 41:17.976
La'Shawn or Da'Shawn, Ti'Shawn.

41:18.076 --> 41:20.745
- Something apostrophe Shawn.
- In a better mood now, are we?

41:20.845 --> 41:23.348
What do you mean?
Yeah. I'm all right.

41:23.448 --> 41:27.886
- Where'd you get it?
- You think I'm using? Are you nuts?

41:28.686 --> 41:31.356
I'm... no. Relax.

41:31.456 --> 41:33.725
Lacey come by last night?

41:33.825 --> 41:34.960
- Good.
- Yeah.

41:35.060 --> 41:36.595
So she picked up the deal?

41:36.695 --> 41:39.230
I wanna talk to you...
Who are you calling?

41:39.330 --> 41:41.132
Who's that? Who is that?

41:41.232 --> 41:42.601
- Lacey.
- Wait, wait!

41:42.701 --> 41:44.269
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, okay.

41:44.369 --> 41:46.137
- She didn't want it.
- Oh.

41:46.237 --> 41:48.106
Okay, so the drugs
are in the tin, then?

41:48.206 --> 41:49.841
Not... no, not exactly.

41:49.941 --> 41:53.812
- The drugs are up your fucking nose?
- Joe, she didn't want her money back.

41:53.912 --> 41:56.715
- Do I seem concerned about the money?
- Well, then you...

41:56.815 --> 41:59.150
You shouldn't deal from
the apartment, okay?

41:59.250 --> 42:02.988
- What do you expect me to do?
- You swore to me you'd quit.

42:03.088 --> 42:06.358
I'm fine. Joe, look at me. I am fine.

42:06.458 --> 42:11.227
I'm trying to tell you something.
I'm not the one you need to worry about.

42:12.762 --> 42:13.763
What?

43:49.259 --> 43:50.995
This is no joke. Give me
all the money right now!

43:51.095 --> 43:52.330
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Okay, please.

43:52.430 --> 43:54.432
It's a real gun.
Give me all the money now.

43:54.532 --> 43:55.967
- Okay, I'm...
- Go! Don't talk, go!

43:56.067 --> 43:57.469
Okay. Okay. I'm so sorry.

43:57.569 --> 43:59.471
I'm not gonna hurt you if you
put the money in the bag.

43:59.571 --> 44:01.372
- Go, go, go.
- Here's the money. Take the money.

44:01.472 --> 44:03.041
- Put it in a bag!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay!

44:03.141 --> 44:04.209
- Go!
- Okay.

44:04.309 --> 44:06.444
I'll fucking kill you! I see more.

44:06.544 --> 44:09.347
- I see there's more! Don't fuck with me!
- Okay!

44:09.447 --> 44:12.314
All of it, all of it.

44:14.185 --> 44:15.787
- Oh, fuck!
- You better run.

44:15.887 --> 44:18.022
Please, please,
just give me something.

44:18.122 --> 44:20.425
- Get the fuck out!
- Please!

44:20.525 --> 44:23.425
Fuck! Fuck!

44:32.569 --> 44:35.173
All right. Well,
how about her friend, Emily?

44:35.273 --> 44:38.374
No, no, no, the other blonde.
The one with the...

44:39.276 --> 44:41.577
Hey, John, let me call you back.

44:43.181 --> 44:45.850
I'm in a lot of trouble, Joe.

44:46.350 --> 44:48.219
How much?

44:48.319 --> 44:50.453
A hundred thousand.

44:52.891 --> 44:54.923
To who?

44:57.127 --> 44:59.395
You don't wanna know.

45:09.540 --> 45:11.442
Cute.

45:11.542 --> 45:14.045
These girls are all local?

45:14.145 --> 45:19.715
Make a bunch of movies here now.
Some big tax break or some shit.

45:26.023 --> 45:30.426
Oh. We gotta lose this Drew.

45:30.961 --> 45:33.229
I'm telling ya.

45:38.002 --> 45:40.536
Oh, fuck.

45:49.713 --> 45:52.017
Hey, Holt?

45:52.617 --> 45:54.853
- Hold on.
- He showed me this photo of a girl.

45:54.953 --> 45:57.353
Yeah, hold on. What?

45:59.524 --> 46:01.827
This is crazy.

46:02.427 --> 46:06.297
Bobby needs a lookalike
for some sex deal.

46:06.397 --> 46:09.267
- Yeah?
- If I find someone, he'll give me 200k

46:09.367 --> 46:11.637
for my show.

46:12.337 --> 46:13.538
- What?
- Yeah.

46:13.638 --> 46:17.275
But the girl, she gets...
she gets 300.

46:17.375 --> 46:20.311
$300,000? For what?

46:20.411 --> 46:23.581
- For fucking somebody?
- Yeah, so, you know, I...

46:23.681 --> 46:26.150
I was thinking if we could
swing it, you know,

46:26.250 --> 46:29.888
200 for the lookalike, 100 for you.

46:29.988 --> 46:33.589
- Let me see.
- Yeah, but we only have 24 hours.

46:34.992 --> 46:36.759
Holy shit.

46:45.536 --> 46:47.639
Hi, J.C.

46:47.739 --> 46:50.041
Yeah, yeah. I-I...

46:50.141 --> 46:53.044
I was just wondering,
has Sadie been in there today?

46:53.144 --> 46:55.246
No, no, no. Everything's fine.

46:55.346 --> 46:58.016
I-I... yeah...

46:58.116 --> 47:01.717
Listen, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

47:04.122 --> 47:08.023
Hello. How are you today?

47:09.359 --> 47:12.661
I said, how are you?

47:19.202 --> 47:22.671
Hello. How are you?

47:25.609 --> 47:28.679
I-I'm fine. What can I help you with?

47:29.079 --> 47:31.482
I'm looking for Sadie.

47:32.082 --> 47:34.085
What's it concerning?

47:34.385 --> 47:37.920
She said she would hook me
up with a free pair of shoes.

47:38.388 --> 47:40.091
So...

47:40.191 --> 47:42.493
- So she offered to give you free shoes?
- I'm sorry.

47:42.593 --> 47:45.096
Did you say something?
I'm... I'm deaf.

47:45.196 --> 47:49.400
So I didn't catch what you said.
But I-I can read lips.

47:49.500 --> 47:53.738
I-I was just... She's always
giving away free shoes.

47:53.838 --> 47:57.275
Well, she bumped into me
at a bar the other night...

47:57.375 --> 48:00.345
- Wait. When? Was it on Friday?
- Yes.

48:00.445 --> 48:02.378
What bar?

48:35.645 --> 48:38.046
You look amazing.

48:38.682 --> 48:40.752
You really do.

48:41.452 --> 48:43.489
Glad you came.

48:44.489 --> 48:46.591
Sorry that I'm late.
I was with some friends

48:46.691 --> 48:50.926
- debating whether or not I should come.
- Right. I get it.

48:51.828 --> 48:56.467
I-I-I'm just gonna say it. I-I was
an asshole to you the other day.

48:56.567 --> 49:00.171
It's a long story, but it wasn't
anything to do with you.

49:00.271 --> 49:03.241
I was dealing with some
weird shit from Joe,

49:03.341 --> 49:07.678
and, I just had... I-I brought
this energy to you, and I'm sorry.

49:07.778 --> 49:10.715
'Cause the truth is,

49:10.815 --> 49:13.084
I can't stop thinking
about the other night.

49:13.184 --> 49:16.084
- I-I'll do whatever...
- Just shut up.

49:16.853 --> 49:18.921
I forgive you.

49:23.560 --> 49:26.028
- I forgive you, too.
- You did get me off cocaine.

49:34.404 --> 49:36.905
Hey. Come on in.

49:41.511 --> 49:44.079
I thought you were going away.

49:45.382 --> 49:47.849
It didn't work out.

50:38.301 --> 50:40.902
I have to talk to
you about something.

50:46.243 --> 50:48.779
Saturday night, after you left,

50:48.879 --> 50:51.916
Joe and the club owners came over,

50:52.016 --> 50:56.320
and they were saying
all this shit about you.

50:56.420 --> 50:59.323
And I got so mad, that's actually...

50:59.423 --> 51:01.325
- That's how this happened.
- What?

51:01.425 --> 51:05.663
Yeah. They were saying that they
had an inside man at the N.O.P.D.,

51:05.763 --> 51:08.699
and they were adamant that
you were somehow involved

51:08.799 --> 51:11.536
and were gonna turn in Joe...

51:11.636 --> 51:15.506
- Why? Why do they think that?
- I don't know. They're crazy,

51:15.606 --> 51:19.644
and I tried to tell them that, I swear
to God. Obviously they didn't listen.

51:19.744 --> 51:23.912
But, Lacey, they want your head.

51:25.715 --> 51:28.617
These guys don't fuck around.

51:43.466 --> 51:45.537
- Wait. I have to have sex with him?
- This is insane.

51:45.637 --> 51:48.162
What's insane is that she
almost turned me into the cops.

51:48.263 --> 51:50.051
- I told you I was sorry.
- She said she was sorry.

51:50.152 --> 51:51.442
I can't believe we're
talking about this.

51:51.542 --> 51:53.611
Joe, I don't care what these guys
are threatening. She's not doing it.

51:53.711 --> 51:56.447
I can't believe we're even talking
about this. What are we talking about?

51:56.547 --> 52:00.818
If I do this, does that mean that I'm off
the hook? No one is coming after me?

52:00.918 --> 52:03.688
Only if you get your
detective friend off my ass.

52:03.788 --> 52:06.924
Well, I... I think that I can.

52:07.024 --> 52:09.825
I just need an advance.

52:11.294 --> 52:12.296
Okay.

52:12.396 --> 52:15.666
No. Hold on. Listen,
you don't have to do this.

52:15.766 --> 52:18.369
- There's got to be another way.
- Maybe it's not so bad.

52:18.469 --> 52:23.007
I get $200,000, no one's gonna kill me.
I'll quit my job, finish my acting course.

52:23.107 --> 52:27.878
We could go on a beach vacation
somewhere. I could start over.

52:27.978 --> 52:29.681
Okay.

52:30.681 --> 52:32.850
All right. I can do this.

52:32.950 --> 52:35.987
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Tell me about her.

52:37.087 --> 52:38.656
Who?

52:38.756 --> 52:40.823
My character.

52:45.695 --> 52:51.736
This was the best jambalaya,
other than my own, you will ever taste.

52:51.836 --> 52:54.905
Yeah, when am I going to try
this legendary cooking of yours?

52:55.005 --> 52:59.043
Joe Mulligan in the flesh.
Got me a birthday tomorrow.

52:59.143 --> 53:00.978
- Could use some reinforcements.
- No, man.

53:01.078 --> 53:02.747
Now's not the time
for this. Seriously.

53:02.847 --> 53:06.350
- Not right now. Seriously.
- Sign your life away.

53:06.450 --> 53:07.551
- Oh.
- Please.

53:07.651 --> 53:09.453
Autograph.

53:10.053 --> 53:11.856
Sure. What's your name? Sorry.

53:11.956 --> 53:16.060
Oh, it's for my wife, Julie. Yeah,
personally, I thought you were overrated.

53:16.160 --> 53:20.364
I kind of forgot her big day last year,
so, you know, trying to make it up.

53:26.103 --> 53:27.539
There you go.

53:28.139 --> 53:32.340
"Julie, your husband is an ass.
Leave him. Joe."

53:33.076 --> 53:35.446
She's gonna love it.

53:35.546 --> 53:37.548
- Thanks, bro.
- Yeah, okay.

53:37.648 --> 53:41.084
- There you go. Your... your pen.
- I'd like that back, yeah.

53:46.757 --> 53:51.327
Listen, I've done some things that I'm
not very proud of in my life, but...

53:53.730 --> 53:56.534
Since I've met you, I-I...

53:56.634 --> 53:58.867
I never wanna let you go.

54:01.037 --> 54:03.939
I'm sorry. Was that too intense?

54:04.974 --> 54:08.143
No, you're wonderful, and...

54:10.814 --> 54:14.819
I just can't stop thinking about
how much of a jerk that guy was.

54:14.919 --> 54:18.954
Yeah, well, welcome to my life.

54:25.993 --> 54:30.100
I have to take this.
I'm so sorry. I got the check.

54:30.400 --> 54:35.404
I will be... right back. Sorry.

55:04.767 --> 55:06.704
All right, gentlemen.
Remember, Lacey...

55:06.804 --> 55:09.473
She's only doing this because
she thinks you want her head.

55:09.573 --> 55:12.476
- I do want her head.
- You want her vagina.

55:12.576 --> 55:16.647
Bobby, there are a lot of vaginas on my
to-do list, but hers ain't one of them.

55:16.747 --> 55:19.884
Well, Frank, without her head,
she's useless to old Willie Spinks.

55:19.984 --> 55:21.572
So don't lose yours.

55:21.673 --> 55:23.487
- After we have her vagina...
- Then I'll have her head.

55:23.587 --> 55:25.656
No, no, no. No, no. No one's
having anyone's head, okay?

55:25.756 --> 55:27.958
She's gonna loan us her vagina.
She gets to keep her head.

55:28.058 --> 55:31.829
- Can we please stop saying "vagina"?
- Bitch was gonna turn you in.

55:31.929 --> 55:35.099
Bitch had no choice, and now
she's offering us a bone.

55:35.199 --> 55:36.932
Vagina.

55:38.201 --> 55:41.703
- Do we agree?
- Yeah. Let's brief her.

55:49.579 --> 55:52.047
Can you pull your hair back a little?

55:52.582 --> 55:55.986
Fuck me, man. Wow. Wow.

55:56.086 --> 55:57.689
All right.

55:58.289 --> 56:01.025
It's gonna take place
this Thursday, okay?

56:01.125 --> 56:04.228
At a hotel in the French quarter.

56:04.328 --> 56:06.897
We're not gonna tell you which,
'cause the less you know, the better.

56:06.997 --> 56:09.200
- What's the call time?
- The what?

56:09.300 --> 56:12.837
- What time am I expected?
- You'll be picked up 6:00 P.M., sharp.

56:12.937 --> 56:15.173
For hair and makeup?

56:15.973 --> 56:18.542
Someone's gonna do my
hair and makeup, right?

56:18.642 --> 56:21.946
- You can't do it?
- She'll definitely need a hairdo.

56:22.046 --> 56:26.751
Yeah, but we should, you know...
We should fucking... We should do it.

56:27.251 --> 56:29.887
You think you can make
my hair look like this?

56:29.987 --> 56:32.656
I'll need a spray. I think
I should consult with...

56:32.756 --> 56:37.027
Hey. All right. You're not gonna consult
with anybody about anything, okay?

56:37.127 --> 56:39.496
- I can't get a spray?
- What's a spray?

56:39.896 --> 56:41.731
To bronze the skin.

56:41.831 --> 56:45.970
Take a spray. But don't tell the person
spraying you why you're taking the spray.

56:46.070 --> 56:50.308
Yeah. And don't come out looking like
an oompa loompa, all orange and shit.

56:50.408 --> 56:54.745
Don't see your usual hairdresser.
You know, you fucking... Got it.

56:55.345 --> 56:57.679
You know, across town.

57:02.852 --> 57:06.825
Sweetheart, you're perfect.
You got the look.

57:07.725 --> 57:12.997
- But you unsettle me.
- Bobby, you can trust her, I swear.

57:13.097 --> 57:16.031
Reassure him, Lacey. Reassure him.

57:20.003 --> 57:22.640
- You have a floater.
- I got a what?

57:22.740 --> 57:25.776
It's a little black speck in your eye.
It's worse in the sunlight.

57:25.876 --> 57:29.280
Yeah, in the glare, it...
The thing, yeah.

57:29.380 --> 57:32.213
I get 'em, too,
mostly when I'm stressed.

57:33.149 --> 57:38.120
There's nothing to worry about.
Your vision will get used to it eventually.

57:45.428 --> 57:47.998
Come on. Pick up, pick up.

57:49.098 --> 57:52.836
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, Holt, how's it going? This is Sadie.

57:52.936 --> 57:55.606
- Why do you sound like that?
<i>- Sadie's from New York.</i>

57:55.706 --> 57:58.008
<i>I was trying to get in character.</i>

57:58.108 --> 58:01.011
- Shouldn't you be at work?
<i>- I called in sick.</i>

58:01.111 --> 58:03.714
<i>I gotta do something to take
my mind off of the big day.</i>

58:03.814 --> 58:05.948
You got any suggestions?

58:09.819 --> 58:12.974
Just transfer it. Transfer it.
You're not... not like...

58:13.075 --> 58:15.993
You're not dancing.
It's just right to lef...

58:16.093 --> 58:18.195
- Just transfer the weight, just like this.
- That's what I'm doing.

58:18.295 --> 58:19.930
Yeah, but you're doing
it like you're at a club.

58:20.031 --> 58:22.091
- Get outta my way.
- All right, all right.

58:22.592 --> 58:24.835
Nice! Okay. Thank God.

58:24.935 --> 58:27.071
You're really terrible.
You're really bad.

58:27.171 --> 58:28.772
- You hit it.
- I did.

58:28.872 --> 58:31.475
It was really ugly, but you
were real purty doing it.

58:31.675 --> 58:35.779
Holt mulligan, hitting balls
into the Mississippi?

58:35.879 --> 58:38.413
Right. What's up, Vincent?

58:40.416 --> 58:41.819
Yeah.

58:42.419 --> 58:46.256
I bet you wish in life you could
take a mulligan sometimes.

58:46.956 --> 58:49.858
Whoa! He's good.

58:50.893 --> 58:52.796
So how do you know each other?

58:52.896 --> 58:54.632
- Through his brother.
- Right.

58:55.332 --> 58:58.369
- A client of Joe?
- Friends. Just a friend.

58:58.869 --> 59:01.836
Don't sweat it, honey.
I won't tell nobody.

59:04.073 --> 59:08.012
Hey, you coming over to my
birthday party on Saturday, right?

59:08.112 --> 59:10.248
Yes, of course.

59:10.848 --> 59:13.050
Okay. You bringing the cake?

59:13.150 --> 59:15.953
Yeah, yeah. Joe's gonna
whip something up.

59:16.053 --> 59:20.024
Yeah, 'cause, you know, at my age,
I get all hung up about the frosting, right?

59:20.124 --> 59:22.292
- Right.
- Right? Yeah.

59:22.392 --> 59:25.593
Okay, here we go. This one's for you.

59:26.729 --> 59:29.667
Whoa! That's a really nice shot.

59:30.467 --> 59:33.904
Well, I'll tell Joe you said hi.
Great. Thanks.

59:34.704 --> 59:37.140
Nice meeting you.

59:38.040 --> 59:40.878
- Good...
- Who the fuck is that?

59:40.978 --> 59:45.215
- Come on, Norma.
- He's, just, you know, one of Joe's pals.

59:45.315 --> 59:48.118
- Okay. All right.
- I don't feel like it.

59:48.218 --> 59:51.452
Really? Oh, you were so...
You had such a promising start.

59:57.860 --> 01:00:00.030
Okay, so, this is kind of weird.

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:04.866
I-I was, I've been seeing
this guy, Joe mulligan?

01:00:06.335 --> 01:00:11.906
Okay. And I found this photo
in his wallet the other night.

01:00:15.545 --> 01:00:19.183
I don't understand.
Sadie never mentioned a Joe.

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:21.452
She's still not picking up.

01:00:21.552 --> 01:00:23.985
And I know the texts aren't from her.

01:00:25.087 --> 01:00:28.122
Have you thought about
calling the cops?

01:00:29.091 --> 01:00:31.226
Yeah, but I can't.

01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:36.467
Look, there's a deal going down
with the guys who own the bar.

01:00:36.567 --> 01:00:39.567
They're paying her 300k
to screw some guy.

01:00:40.169 --> 01:00:41.839
I didn't catch that last part.

01:00:41.939 --> 01:00:46.007
300,000 to fuck a guy.

01:00:56.919 --> 01:00:58.720
I'll be home soon, all right?

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:05.362
- What's up?
- I wanted to give you this.

01:01:05.462 --> 01:01:08.031
I left the battery thing at
home but I'll give it to you

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:11.432
and I'll have the rest for
you by the end of the week.

01:01:17.907 --> 01:01:19.740
Where'd you get this?

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:23.544
Do you want it?

01:01:24.881 --> 01:01:26.347
All right, then.

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:42.297
No. No, no, no, no, no. This is
not what we agreed on, okay?

01:02:15.097 --> 01:02:19.603
Yeah, well, I'm not happy about this either.
Do I sound happy about this?

01:02:19.703 --> 01:02:22.272
All right, listen.
Okay, listen. Listen.

01:02:22.372 --> 01:02:25.542
Just reimburse me for the
French bread pan, okay?

01:02:25.642 --> 01:02:29.913
I will keep the cassoulet ramekin.
Right, okay.

01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:33.517
You know what, I actually I want
the skillet with the copper base,

01:02:33.617 --> 01:02:35.750
gotta have the copper base.
All right, Janet?

01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:39.089
Can I call you back? Thanks.

01:02:39.189 --> 01:02:41.758
- What? What is it? What's wrong?
- I'll tell you what's wrong.

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:45.429
Your little buddy Vincent, and his fucking
dog have been following us around all day.

01:02:45.529 --> 01:02:48.498
- That's what's wrong.
- Us? Who's us?

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:51.032
Lacey. Me and Lacey.

01:02:52.501 --> 01:02:54.438
- What?
- Why are you hanging out with Lacey?

01:02:54.538 --> 01:02:57.107
I'm not hanging out with her.
We just went to hit some balls.

01:02:57.207 --> 01:03:00.577
You realize if I was here Saturday night
when she came over, I'd be in jail right now.

01:03:00.677 --> 01:03:02.979
- You understand that? Right?
- Yeah. I know, Joe.

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:06.083
Come on, man. She was fucking scared.
She had cops half way up her ass.

01:03:06.183 --> 01:03:09.286
And there's, there's a reason,
by the way, that...

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:11.655
Oh, so you like her now?
You have a little crush on her?

01:03:11.755 --> 01:03:15.325
Oh, shut up. You always do that. No,
I don't have a crush on her, I just...

01:03:15.425 --> 01:03:18.962
Let me ask you, though.
This guy that she's got to...

01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:22.633
- Fuck.
- Well, what do we know about him?

01:03:22.733 --> 01:03:25.568
We know what we need
to know, which is nothing.

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:28.036
Right. But..

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:33.110
Okay, but is, is she gonna be safe?

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:38.713
I mean, can we ask him to wear
a condom at least? Or two?

01:04:01.737 --> 01:04:03.006
Come on, come on, come on.

01:04:03.106 --> 01:04:07.010
Yo, lady bug. Hey, we got cheap shoes,
cheap handbags, what you need?

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:11.047
- Thank you, but I'm kind of busy.
- Oh, it's for your store. Designer.

01:04:11.147 --> 01:04:13.216
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. Look, look, look.

01:04:13.316 --> 01:04:15.052
We got cheap shoes,
we got Gucci, Fendi, Prada.

01:04:15.152 --> 01:04:19.189
- His price is cheap, I'm telling you.
- Oh, they're cheap, all right.

01:04:19.289 --> 01:04:21.325
Did either of you two slave
away at fashion school

01:04:21.425 --> 01:04:22.993
while surviving on two-minute
noodles and tap water?

01:04:23.093 --> 01:04:25.295
Actually, we love two-minute noodles.

01:04:25.395 --> 01:04:27.531
Look, baby, ain't no trouble here,
come on. Come on.

01:04:27.631 --> 01:04:30.634
- Get your hands, let me go...
- Come on, hurry. Come on, Jules. Come on.

01:04:30.734 --> 01:04:32.302
- Come on, man, hurry up.
- Get off me.

01:04:32.402 --> 01:04:34.035
Get her leg, man. Come on.

01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:46.249
Oh, nice.

01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:47.250
Bitch, stop moving.

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:48.719
Come on, control her.

01:04:48.819 --> 01:04:50.487
Put her in here.

01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:52.389
Wait, wait, wait,
we ain't doing no killing, man.

01:04:52.489 --> 01:04:55.659
Hey, you want to take over for Joe,
you got to step up your game.

01:04:55.759 --> 01:04:59.527
- Joey never killed nobody, though, Frank.
- She's seen your faces.

01:04:59.962 --> 01:05:01.896
Get her in there.

01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:03.998
Fuck!

01:05:05.601 --> 01:05:09.539
Now she was going to compromise
our deal. So harden the fuck up.

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:12.707
- What did she do, Frank?
- She asked too many questions.

01:05:14.176 --> 01:05:17.047
- Sorry, boss.
- Nah, it's all right.

01:05:17.147 --> 01:05:20.548
She's just looking for her girlfriend,
who she's never going to see again.

01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:23.320
That's right, honey. That's right.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:26.089
He was always going to
fuck her, and then kill her.

01:05:26.189 --> 01:05:28.525
I just left that out of
the job description.

01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:32.162
Sorry. Push it in. But you
don't tell Bobby I said that.

01:05:32.562 --> 01:05:36.767
In. Get up some speed. Come on.

01:05:36.867 --> 01:05:38.533
There you go.

01:05:40.836 --> 01:05:43.541
Great. Great.

01:05:44.241 --> 01:05:47.575
- Come on, push it in, man.
- Shit.

01:05:49.845 --> 01:05:51.448
Useless. You're useless.

01:05:51.548 --> 01:05:53.683
- Frank, it ain't working.
- All right, all right.

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:55.950
Any of you idiots have a gas can?

01:05:58.854 --> 01:06:01.088
Have to do everything myself.

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:07.230
All right. We got a gas can.

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:09.797
All right, let's go to work.
Come on. Come on.

01:06:57.012 --> 01:06:59.914
Hey, Bernard. Thanks. I'll clean
up before I get outta here.

01:07:00.916 --> 01:07:05.322
Okay. Contrary to popular opinion,
the key is to keep flipping the burger

01:07:05.422 --> 01:07:10.360
so that you get a nice delicate crust on
the outside but it stays rare on the inside.

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:13.830
Now, we've got homemade
thousand island, all right?

01:07:13.930 --> 01:07:18.535
Which is going to consist of,
olive oil, lemon juice, worcestershire.

01:07:18.635 --> 01:07:20.901
We got some paprika.

01:07:24.907 --> 01:07:26.874
You don't seem impressed.

01:07:28.777 --> 01:07:30.745
How do you know Sadie Hill?

01:07:32.915 --> 01:07:37.418
I know about the deal.
With Holt and Lacey.

01:07:38.387 --> 01:07:40.421
Who are you?

01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:46.561
- I found a photo in your wallet.
- You went through my wallet?

01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:49.697
What's happened to Sadie?

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:52.366
Look, she's

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:57.705
She's not playing ball
with this deal. That's all.

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:03.947
Her girlfriend Drew said
she was all about it,

01:08:04.047 --> 01:08:09.784
that she had a meeting the night I met
you and Drew hasn't seen her since.

01:08:10.319 --> 01:08:11.786
Really?

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:16.357
Are you a drug dealer?

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:37.781
Call Mila. Face time.

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:41.384
And that's the only reason,
the only reason,

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.587
I got into it in the first place.

01:08:43.687 --> 01:08:47.390
Now I have this one crazy deal.
I get to do my show,

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:51.024
and I leave all this crap behind.

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:56.964
Haven't you ever just wanted
to hit a race? To start over?

01:09:01.603 --> 01:09:03.069
You okay?

01:09:03.738 --> 01:09:05.206
Yeah.

01:09:08.109 --> 01:09:09.946
Your, your phone.

01:09:13.415 --> 01:09:15.750
I have to take this.

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:29.729
Lacey, what the fuck you doing?

01:09:32.067 --> 01:09:35.404
- What do you think?
- I look ridiculous.

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:37.337
Why so blonde?

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:39.506
It's for a role.

01:09:45.613 --> 01:09:48.018
Some hotel in the quarter.
But less you know, the better.

01:09:48.118 --> 01:09:50.283
Yeah. I got it.

01:09:51.019 --> 01:09:52.390
But,

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:59.326
Bobby, I'm curious,
what's the deal with this Sadie?

01:10:01.463 --> 01:10:05.001
I mean, what does she
think about all this?

01:10:05.101 --> 01:10:08.605
She's on vacation. All expenses paid.

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:12.106
Okay. Well, then, that's cool.

01:10:13.776 --> 01:10:15.645
- Is that all?
- Yeah.

01:10:15.745 --> 01:10:17.647
- Good.
- I'll be in the kitchen. You hungry?

01:10:17.747 --> 01:10:20.417
Nope. Hey, Joe?

01:10:21.017 --> 01:10:24.885
You did good with Lacey. Thank you.

01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:28.391
Where is Sadie? I want to see Sadie.

01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:30.527
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I want to see Sadie.

01:10:30.627 --> 01:10:34.597
- Put that fucking thing down.
- You stay back. Where is my girl?

01:10:34.697 --> 01:10:36.766
She's fine.

01:10:36.866 --> 01:10:39.969
If you don't bring Sadie to me right now,
then I'm calling the cops.

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:42.972
Why the fuck would we
hurt Sadie? We need Sadie.

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:46.473
Oh, yeah. You need her.
Right about...

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:48.678
Fuck.

01:10:48.778 --> 01:10:51.846
Frank! What's wrong with you?

01:10:52.981 --> 01:10:54.849
Motherfucker.

01:10:55.184 --> 01:10:56.920
Holt!

01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:00.623
- Hey, hey. Get up. Get up.
- The fuck?

01:11:00.723 --> 01:11:02.659
- Deal's off.
- What?

01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:05.426
Call Lacey. The deal is off.

01:11:06.094 --> 01:11:07.530
Why?

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:11.668
Oh, you're nervous? Yeah? You know if
I don't get Vincent that cash on Sunday,

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:14.938
I'm going to get shat out by a
crocodile on Tuesday, so, I get it.

01:11:15.038 --> 01:11:16.940
We have to find another
way to get the money.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.743
I knew you'd do this.
There's no other way.

01:11:19.843 --> 01:11:22.910
Joe, we talked about this.
Come on, come on.

01:11:24.112 --> 01:11:26.149
Look, you think I really
want her to do this?

01:11:26.249 --> 01:11:28.518
I like this girl. I don't
want her to go fuck...

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:30.086
- Two girls are dead.
- I know, I know.

01:11:30.186 --> 01:11:34.555
But this is different. She's going to
get in and out. It's going to be fine.

01:11:35.824 --> 01:11:37.694
I've taken precautions, believe me.

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:40.530
Oh yeah? What precautions
have you taken?

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:42.596
Okay. Mace.

01:11:52.908 --> 01:11:54.375
Hey.

01:11:55.277 --> 01:11:57.344
I went and asked about Sadie.

01:11:58.847 --> 01:12:00.914
It was an accident.

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:03.217
She's dead.

01:12:04.953 --> 01:12:06.420
Sorry.

01:12:07.256 --> 01:12:10.257
That's why they needed the lookalike.

01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:13.394
- I should call Drew.
- No.

01:12:13.962 --> 01:12:16.030
You can't.

01:12:24.706 --> 01:12:28.475
- D-day.
- Yeah.

01:12:47.829 --> 01:12:49.997
Whatever happens tonight,

01:12:51.233 --> 01:12:53.433
I just want you to know,

01:12:55.203 --> 01:12:57.338
I understand.

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:12.922
Yeah?

01:13:13.022 --> 01:13:15.925
<i>Frank. I'm here.
I hope she's not far.</i>

01:13:16.025 --> 01:13:19.095
<i>The product will be delivered
as soon as I'm satisfied.</i>

01:13:19.195 --> 01:13:20.661
Yeah.

01:13:41.249 --> 01:13:42.552
Put the money in the room?

01:13:42.652 --> 01:13:45.588
Yeah, they're right above me.
I can hear every sound.

01:13:45.688 --> 01:13:49.890
- Lucky you. Keep me posted.
- Oh, yeah.

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:01.237
You know what's the one thing
a girl finds more disconcerting

01:14:01.337 --> 01:14:04.138
than having to sleep with
a total stranger for money?

01:14:07.843 --> 01:14:10.710
Having a guy watch her
while she does her makeup.

01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:17.220
Sorry.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:19.823
I hear ya. Okay.

01:14:20.723 --> 01:14:22.689
Let me get you another drink.

01:15:01.296 --> 01:15:04.398
New York.

01:15:19.014 --> 01:15:20.481
You Lacey?

01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:26.947
Holt! Holt.

01:16:36.024 --> 01:16:38.094
- Holt?
- Joe, this is Lacey.

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:40.163
What's wrong?
You should be at the hotel.

01:16:40.263 --> 01:16:41.998
<i>This woman, she came in here.</i>

01:16:42.098 --> 01:16:46.069
And she was dressed like Sadie.
She had her hair cut.

01:16:46.169 --> 01:16:47.904
- What?
<i>- And she,</i>

01:16:48.004 --> 01:16:51.974
she drugged us and she bound us on
the bed, and she stole my phone,

01:16:52.074 --> 01:16:56.212
and, I don't know, she took the outfit.
I don't know what she's doing.

01:16:56.312 --> 01:16:59.215
Was that, I mean was that,
was that Sadie?

01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:01.284
I mean, who else could
have known about this?

01:17:01.384 --> 01:17:02.849
No one.

01:17:03.552 --> 01:17:05.219
Oh, fuck.

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:09.390
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:17:24.472 --> 01:17:25.939
Sadie.

01:17:26.608 --> 01:17:28.442
You've grown up.

01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:32.746
Do you recognize me?

01:17:35.584 --> 01:17:37.651
You were very young.

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:42.789
Can I get something for you?

01:17:45.293 --> 01:17:46.960
Lobster.

01:17:47.362 --> 01:17:49.162
You can go now.

01:17:50.198 --> 01:17:51.865
Thank you.

01:18:06.615 --> 01:18:11.254
Yeah, hi, I'm looking for a Lacey Fitzgerald.
I believe she has a room there.

01:18:11.354 --> 01:18:13.887
<i>- Let me check, ma'am.</i>
- Thank you.

01:18:16.324 --> 01:18:19.128
<i>I'm sorry, we have no
guests under that name.</i>

01:18:19.228 --> 01:18:20.694
All right, thank you.

01:18:21.529 --> 01:18:24.867
Mila! Mila.

01:18:24.967 --> 01:18:28.735
Mila! Mila.

01:18:38.513 --> 01:18:40.183
What the hell are we going to do?

01:18:40.283 --> 01:18:43.417
I'm going to fuck this guy,
get the cash, and save my ass.

01:18:44.286 --> 01:18:46.088
Yes, hello?

01:18:46.188 --> 01:18:48.755
Hi, I'd like a lobster please.

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:52.292
And another bottle of champagne.

01:18:53.929 --> 01:18:55.595
That's right.

01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:10.777
Thank you.

01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:28.564
- What the fuck. How long's it been?
- Louis took her in at nine o'clock.

01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:31.601
- Not too bronzed?
- I haven't seen her.

01:19:31.701 --> 01:19:35.437
So he does the deed, he leaves,
briefcase stays in her room.

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:38.507
Why does the briefcase stay in the room?
She takes it when she's done.

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:40.206
Of course.

01:19:41.609 --> 01:19:43.880
Hey Frank, is there something
going on I don't know about?

01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:47.080
Will you relax? I got this.

01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:53.687
No. Come on, come on, come on.

01:20:10.372 --> 01:20:14.174
Well, Sadie, I guess this is
all a little strange, isn't it?

01:20:15.276 --> 01:20:18.945
Or is it Baps? Didn't your
dad used to call you that?

01:20:21.516 --> 01:20:26.422
Sorry, I'm... nervous.

01:20:26.522 --> 01:20:30.495
Well, when I press record,
I want you to act...

01:20:30.996 --> 01:20:33.259
like you love me.

01:20:35.597 --> 01:20:37.063
Okay?

01:20:53.715 --> 01:20:55.182
Hello?

01:20:57.118 --> 01:21:00.887
That doesn't matter.
Just send up whatever you have.

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:19.573
I'm sorry.

01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:22.386
- Talk to me.
<i>- I've got Bobby.</i>

01:22:22.487 --> 01:22:23.439
You sure?

01:22:23.539 --> 01:22:26.342
- No, we got everything. Big deal went down.
<i>- I'm on my way.</i>

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:29.175
All right. I'll meet
you at the station.

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:45.394
Hey, hey, what are you doing here?

01:22:45.494 --> 01:22:47.496
- Is she up there?
- Dude, this dude is sick, man.

01:22:47.596 --> 01:22:49.165
Fuck 'em and snuff 'em.

01:22:49.265 --> 01:22:50.332
We got to get up there.

01:22:50.432 --> 01:22:54.167
- The room's guarded, bro. Guns.
- Fuck.

01:22:55.002 --> 01:22:59.406
- She ordered room service. Lobster.
- Come on.

01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:05.078
Frederick.

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:08.682
Good job, bitches.

01:23:09.884 --> 01:23:11.351
Yeah, it's the shit.

01:23:12.687 --> 01:23:16.089
Come on. Let's go. Let's get
out of here, motherfucker.

01:23:23.831 --> 01:23:26.469
- Hey.
- Joe Mulligan.

01:23:26.569 --> 01:23:29.205
- Yeah, man. How are you?
- I'm excellent.

01:23:29.305 --> 01:23:34.376
Wow, all this going up to
William Spinks? Room eight?

01:23:34.476 --> 01:23:35.878
We're really not supposed to say.

01:23:35.978 --> 01:23:39.482
You know what,
I'm a close friend of his.

01:23:39.582 --> 01:23:41.715
Do you mind if I take it up?

01:23:54.596 --> 01:23:56.329
Flush it!

01:23:57.532 --> 01:24:01.735
Flush it. Flush this shit right now.

01:24:27.028 --> 01:24:29.095
<i>Advancing through parking structure.</i>

01:24:43.344 --> 01:24:46.282
Freeze. Put your hands on your head.

01:24:46.382 --> 01:24:48.348
Put your hands on your head.

01:25:01.296 --> 01:25:04.364
Happy Birthday to you.

01:25:06.668 --> 01:25:10.773
Happy Birthday to you.

01:25:10.873 --> 01:25:14.040
Happy Birthday, dear Al.

01:25:15.977 --> 01:25:18.414
Happy Birthday, Al.

01:25:18.514 --> 01:25:22.982
I bet you never expected to see this
when you turned your computer on today.

01:25:26.688 --> 01:25:30.693
Like when I came home six months ago

01:25:30.793 --> 01:25:34.828
and saw my little girl...

01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:38.664
My Georgia...

01:25:39.767 --> 01:25:45.141
Lying face down on the bed,
having put a pistol to her temple.

01:25:45.541 --> 01:25:49.709
She was in and out of
institutions her whole life.

01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:52.745
Her whole life.

01:25:53.548 --> 01:25:57.617
And I never knew why. Until...

01:25:58.453 --> 01:26:02.989
That suicide note
explained everything.

01:26:03.991 --> 01:26:08.594
About all the things that
went on in Versailles.

01:26:09.697 --> 01:26:14.570
Between an 11 year old
and a 40 year old man.

01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:17.573
I couldn't save Georgia then.

01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:20.840
And... and you...

01:26:21.542 --> 01:26:24.310
You can't save Sadie now.

01:26:31.619 --> 01:26:34.490
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Can I help you?

01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:38.391
Yeah, I have champagne
and lobster for Mr. Spinks.

01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:45.798
You're going to have to wait here.

01:27:34.949 --> 01:27:36.850
No, no, no, no, no.

01:27:58.806 --> 01:28:00.843
Joe. Joe, we gotta go, Joe.

01:28:00.943 --> 01:28:03.643
- Come on, Joe.
- Get out of here.

01:28:24.765 --> 01:28:30.536
To the naval yard. Pier three.
Pier fucking three, Paul. Five minutes.

01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:37.477
Go.

01:29:36.771 --> 01:29:40.642
Murphy. I got a man down.
We're on the east side of the factory,

01:29:40.742 --> 01:29:44.377
the principal's headed north
toward the river. I'm on foot.

01:29:51.953 --> 01:29:53.419
Hey.

01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:57.493
- The fuck are you doing?
- Your dirty work.

01:29:57.593 --> 01:30:00.026
- Give it to me.
- Fuck you.

01:31:00.388 --> 01:31:02.055
Hey.

01:31:02.423 --> 01:31:05.827
- Joey? What are you doing here?
- Did you know she was going to die?

01:31:05.927 --> 01:31:08.964
- What do you care?
- Did you know?

01:31:09.064 --> 01:31:12.165
Collateral damage.
Bitch put the heat on us...

01:31:16.203 --> 01:31:18.237
Wrong bitch.

01:32:08.188 --> 01:32:10.723
Get out of here.
Get back in the car. Go!

01:32:25.472 --> 01:32:28.210
Stop. Police. Bobby Zan. I got you,

01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:31.346
I will blow your fucking head
clear off, I swear to Christ.

01:32:31.446 --> 01:32:35.183
That's right. Nice and easy.
Put your weapon down.

01:32:35.283 --> 01:32:38.253
Put your weapon down,
hands up. It's over, man.

01:32:38.353 --> 01:32:40.486
- Okay.
- That's right.

01:32:41.522 --> 01:32:45.791
Nice and easy. Hands up.

01:32:47.428 --> 01:32:50.596
- To your ground, now!
- All right.

01:33:25.332 --> 01:33:28.370
<i>Joe, lovely Joe,</i>

01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:33.572
<i>who came into my world at
just the right and wrong time.</i>

01:33:34.909 --> 01:33:37.713
<i>But that's not how I
want you to remember us,</i>

01:33:37.813 --> 01:33:41.847
<i>as too brief or too late.</i>

01:33:43.117 --> 01:33:46.855
<i>I didn't lose my hearing
or my leg in an accident.</i>

01:33:46.955 --> 01:33:49.991
<i>I battled cancer since
I was eighteen.</i>

01:33:50.091 --> 01:33:53.161
<i>It was back and I was done.</i>

01:33:53.261 --> 01:33:57.432
<i>When I found out about the plan,
I knew I could help.</i>

01:33:57.532 --> 01:34:02.838
<i>Because opportunities,
moments, people,</i>

01:34:02.938 --> 01:34:08.307
<i>they come into our lives and shape things
in the most unexpected, positive ways.</i>

01:34:10.611 --> 01:34:13.812
<i>Ways that shouldn't be
measured with regret.</i>

01:34:21.956 --> 01:34:24.022
Who's your friend?

01:34:24.925 --> 01:34:27.092
Oh, that's Joe's brother.

01:34:28.562 --> 01:34:30.799
Holt Mulligan?

01:34:30.899 --> 01:34:32.732
You know him?

01:34:33.334 --> 01:34:38.071
Seriously? Lacey, you realize
he's a cokehead, right?

01:35:31.125 --> 01:35:33.325
Hey Holt, come here.

01:35:34.228 --> 01:35:37.899
You know what? You're a real asshole.

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:40.833
- Remember that.
- I know.

01:36:05.259 --> 01:36:08.263
<i>So take this opportunity, Joe,</i>

01:36:08.363 --> 01:36:12.898
<i>and make the most of a new life,
the life I know you want.</i>

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:17.302
<i>And Joe?</i>

01:36:18.272 --> 01:36:22.174
<i>Don't forget me. Okay?</i>

01:36:28.182 --> 01:36:30.285
<i>And do take the time to
make your own sauce.</i>

01:36:30.385 --> 01:36:32.220
<i>I know it's gonna sound
a little fattening,</i>

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:37.192
<i>but I like to use butter,
cream, provolone, and romano.</i>

01:36:37.292 --> 01:36:40.629
You know, good food
really is like music.

01:36:40.729 --> 01:36:44.902
The beautiful notes take you
back to that quality company,

01:36:45.003 --> 01:36:47.633
or that special occasion.

01:36:48.135 --> 01:36:49.970
Okay...
