00:14.923 --> 00:17.300
Trust me, I'm your friend.

00:23.056 --> 00:24.558
Bawk! Run for your lives!

00:27.143 --> 00:28.520
Finger five on it!

00:50.249 --> 00:51.793
Get it, Lucky.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.970
Ah, don't worry, Lucky, Kong can get it.

01:04.096 --> 01:05.890
I got this one.

01:05.974 --> 01:09.978
Come on, Panchi, get real.
You can't lift that.

01:10.061 --> 01:12.856
Oh, yes, I can.
But you try first.

01:12.939 --> 01:15.524
Oh, it's on.

01:18.987 --> 01:21.405
I give up.

01:21.489 --> 01:22.657
My turn.

01:22.741 --> 01:26.703
Give me a place to stand
and with a lever,

01:26.786 --> 01:28.579
I can move the whole world.

01:31.625 --> 01:34.669
- You come up with that?
- No, I read it.

01:34.753 --> 01:38.006
A guy named Archimedes said it,
like, 2,000 years ago.

01:44.262 --> 01:46.305
Monkey see, monkey do.

01:46.389 --> 01:49.809
Don't give Kong any ideas.
He might really move the world.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.774
Supposed to be a big storm coming.

01:55.857 --> 01:58.484
Better get back to the tree fort.

02:03.364 --> 02:06.785
Witnesses say the craft
was hit by a lightning bolt.

02:06.868 --> 02:09.871
Seconds later, it crashed into the bridge.

02:12.165 --> 02:14.626
Rescue vehicles couldn't get close!

02:14.709 --> 02:17.461
We're hoping the crane can!

02:22.175 --> 02:24.928
Oh, no.
What are they going to do now?

02:28.514 --> 02:30.349
Kong says he can save them.

02:30.433 --> 02:32.686
Yeah, if we move fast.
Let's do it, Jonesy.

02:35.689 --> 02:39.651
Okay. Kong's camouflaged
and on his way to the spire.

02:39.734 --> 02:40.777
Good.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.946
The sooner we get out of this storm,
the better.

02:50.619 --> 02:52.496
That's right, Kong.

02:52.580 --> 02:54.373
Closer.

02:54.457 --> 02:56.042
Closer.

02:56.125 --> 02:58.419
It's gonna be great when Kong decloaks

02:58.502 --> 03:01.047
and saves that family
with the whole world watching.

03:01.130 --> 03:04.843
Whoa. Maybe this will finally
convince people that he's not a monster.

03:15.561 --> 03:17.772
You're mine.

03:20.984 --> 03:24.570
Through some miracle,
the craft has broken free.

03:24.653 --> 03:27.323
Yeah, a miracle named Kong!

03:27.406 --> 03:29.533
Yeah, I knew the big guy could do it!

03:29.617 --> 03:31.786
Now, let's get out of this soup
and head for home.

03:31.870 --> 03:35.039
Oh! Kong did it!

03:35.123 --> 03:37.917
But why did he stay invisible?

03:38.001 --> 03:41.838
I thought I saw him for a sec but
it was almost too quick to notice.

03:41.921 --> 03:45.800
I don't think anybody else could see
that Kong saved the day.

03:54.392 --> 03:56.352
I have captured Kong.

03:58.479 --> 04:03.484
Something you two mighty hunters
have been unable to accomplish.

04:03.567 --> 04:07.822
I believe we have
successfully minimized his threat.

04:07.906 --> 04:11.951
Yes, thanks to the genius
of my shrinking ray,

04:12.035 --> 04:14.913
you're finally helpless in my hand.

04:16.539 --> 04:17.957
Ow!

04:19.333 --> 04:21.418
He doesn't seem so helpless.

04:23.587 --> 04:25.799
Hmm.

04:25.882 --> 04:29.928
My titanium skin is far superior
to human flesh.

04:34.348 --> 04:36.309
And speaking of superior,

04:36.392 --> 04:40.313
might I remind you
that without my advanced calculations,

04:40.396 --> 04:43.524
you would not have been able
to create the shrinking ray.

04:43.607 --> 04:47.570
And you would not have been able
to make those calculations

04:47.653 --> 04:49.738
if I hadn't created you.

04:49.823 --> 04:52.700
That makes me the real genius.

04:53.952 --> 04:55.203
Doesn't it?

04:55.286 --> 04:58.081
You selling the ape
or turning him over to Decker?

04:58.164 --> 04:59.290
Neither.

04:59.373 --> 05:04.462
I plan to study this freak of nature
before I dispose of him.

05:12.428 --> 05:13.972
How do you like your new home?

05:17.976 --> 05:20.686
Behave yourself or you'll get a roommate.

05:20.769 --> 05:24.690
Perhaps a tarantula,
or maybe a hungry snake.

05:27.610 --> 05:30.196
Have a nice day.

05:36.995 --> 05:38.537
Okay, I'm starting to freak.

05:38.621 --> 05:41.374
We've been searching all night
and there's still no sign of Kong...

05:41.457 --> 05:43.209
even with Lucky on his scent.

05:45.962 --> 05:48.422
It's not like him to disappear like this.

06:14.657 --> 06:15.824
Oops.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.244
Better hit the panic button.

07:11.797 --> 07:13.632
Bested by a two-inch ape?

07:18.137 --> 07:20.473
Botila, ready all the bionobots.

07:20.556 --> 07:22.976
We are going on a mouse hunt.

07:37.115 --> 07:38.699
There's nowhere to run.

07:49.460 --> 07:52.630
Everything in here was designed
to destroy you.

08:25.746 --> 08:27.456
What are you doing?
Get off of there!

08:32.086 --> 08:33.712
Curse you, Kong!

09:00.614 --> 09:03.742
You filthy ape!
When I catch you, I'm gonna...

09:03.826 --> 09:04.910
Ahh!

10:25.199 --> 10:26.700
Give me a place to stand,

10:26.784 --> 10:29.578
and with a lever,
I can move the whole world.

11:14.248 --> 11:17.960
If his camo gear is here,
and nobody's reported seeing him, then...

11:18.043 --> 11:20.338
Something must be way wrong.

11:20.421 --> 11:23.549
Agreed. Right now, we better hook
Kong's gear to the copter

11:23.632 --> 11:25.218
and head back to the tree fort.

11:25.301 --> 11:28.429
Then we can try to figure out
what could've happened to him.

12:31.909 --> 12:33.952
Monkey see, monkey do.

12:55.849 --> 12:57.059
Hmm.

12:57.142 --> 12:59.770
Danny said he thought he saw
Kong for an instant.

12:59.853 --> 13:01.229
Let's see what the camera caught.

13:02.398 --> 13:05.443
Scroll forward at quarter speed. Stop.

13:05.526 --> 13:07.027
Sharpen.

13:07.110 --> 13:08.904
Zoom in. Stop.

13:08.987 --> 13:10.072
Enhance and enlarge.

13:10.155 --> 13:11.407
Hold it.

13:11.490 --> 13:12.658
Pan right.

13:12.741 --> 13:14.410
Advance three frames...

13:15.160 --> 13:16.495
Stop. Botila?

13:16.579 --> 13:18.288
Advance two frames.

13:18.372 --> 13:19.665
Stop.

13:20.708 --> 13:22.835
Whoa. A shrink ray?

13:22.918 --> 13:24.962
Lukas, you're gonna wanna see this.

13:48.235 --> 13:50.696
Haven't you found him yet?

13:50.779 --> 13:52.239
Still searching.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.702
There.

13:56.785 --> 13:59.037
Activate the squid! Get him!

14:39.495 --> 14:42.247
First thing, we gotta disable that device.

14:42.330 --> 14:45.083
If Richard shrinks us, it's game over.

14:45.167 --> 14:47.628
You two promise to stay
in the chopper, right?

14:48.546 --> 14:50.088
You got it.

15:15.948 --> 15:17.115
Perfect.

15:17.199 --> 15:19.910
Now give that puny pest a one-way ticket

15:19.993 --> 15:22.037
to the end of the line.

15:37.302 --> 15:39.221
Right on schedule.

16:15.382 --> 16:18.093
You're running out of options, Kong.

16:18.176 --> 16:22.055
I've got you now, you minuscule pain.

16:23.306 --> 16:25.392
Actually, I have him.

16:27.435 --> 16:30.105
This is it.
He's got nowhere left to hide.

16:30.188 --> 16:31.482
It's over.

16:32.941 --> 16:34.818
It's over all right, Richard!

16:46.038 --> 16:47.748
Lukas, good.

16:47.831 --> 16:52.460
Let's see how well you do against me
without your giant ape to save you.

16:52.545 --> 16:57.090
I get to finish that miserable
mini-monkey once and for all.

16:57.174 --> 16:59.802
You get less human every time I see you.

16:59.885 --> 17:01.762
Yes, thank you.

17:01.845 --> 17:04.138
And more evolved.

17:07.224 --> 17:08.769
You can't touch me.

17:12.271 --> 17:14.608
Right. Built-in force field.

17:15.108 --> 17:17.694
Pity you have no such protection.

17:27.037 --> 17:29.707
How about picking on someone
your own size, Botila?

17:36.463 --> 17:39.382
- Huh?
- You never give up.

18:31.059 --> 18:32.978
Goodbye, Mr. Jones.

18:43.030 --> 18:45.866
Hey! We stayed in the chopper
like we promised!

18:48.576 --> 18:50.954
Good thing, too.
Thanks, Danny.

18:53.290 --> 18:57.002
Yes. At least I'll get rid
of one annoyance.

19:09.056 --> 19:10.933
Oh!

19:19.066 --> 19:21.109
Oh! Dude!

19:24.321 --> 19:26.489
Force field works pretty good
if you can survive

19:26.573 --> 19:28.784
20 tons of raging ape falling on you.

19:28.867 --> 19:32.245
Too bad the shrink ray
didn't work as well.

19:32.329 --> 19:35.540
Don't just stand there
like a metal mannequin.

19:35.623 --> 19:37.751
Call in an air strike!

19:37.835 --> 19:40.295
Already done.

19:42.923 --> 19:44.424
Time to book it, bro.

19:57.062 --> 19:58.939
Whoa!

20:00.023 --> 20:01.399
Don't worry, I got this!

20:05.320 --> 20:07.239
And that's how you fly a chopper!

20:07.322 --> 20:10.533
Careful, Kong!
You're not tiny anymore!

20:12.953 --> 20:15.622
Good to have you back, big buddy.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.502
Every single time!

20:20.585 --> 20:24.006
I cannot express how much I hate that ape.

20:24.089 --> 20:30.888
Hmm. The inability to aptly communicate
is merely one of your human failings.

20:36.393 --> 20:39.813
If I want it done right,
I have to do it myself.

20:39.897 --> 20:44.151
In one minute, I will enhance
my own already superior mind

20:44.234 --> 20:46.069
to surpass your AI.

20:46.153 --> 20:49.823
And then, you'll be as obsolete
as last season's holo-phone.

20:49.907 --> 20:52.200
Just another relic on my shelf.

20:54.702 --> 20:56.454
Oh, no.

20:58.123 --> 20:59.624
How clumsy of me.

20:59.707 --> 21:03.295
What have you done, you dirty, rotten bot?

21:05.839 --> 21:09.051
The question is, what should I do now?

21:11.636 --> 21:13.931
Perhaps, Dr. Remy,

21:14.014 --> 21:17.600
it's time to end our relationship.
