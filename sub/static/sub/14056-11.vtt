00:00.145 --> 00:01.605
Previously on The O.C...

00:01.678 --> 00:05.129
I figured I'd do all right in a few surf competitions, maybe hook up with some sponsors.

00:05.208 --> 00:06.477
Turn that into a career, you know?

00:06.609 --> 00:08.847
I'll get the operation and get back on my board.

00:08.934 --> 00:09.733
What's going on with you guys?

00:09.818 --> 00:10.837
I can talk to him.

00:10.875 --> 00:13.676
Knowing that you're pulling for me is the only thing that keeps me going.

00:15.263 --> 00:16.117
Mom, hi.

00:16.203 --> 00:17.118
Hurry, I'm running late.

00:17.196 --> 00:19.259
If you'd just loosen up a little bit, you would be...

00:19.271 --> 00:20.807
I would be one of the popular girls.

00:20.884 --> 00:23.604
Truth is, I'm looking down the barrel of divorce number two.

00:23.690 --> 00:24.896
I live in a trailer park.

00:24.972 --> 00:27.744
No student has ever been involved in a shooting.

00:27.818 --> 00:29.674
Apparently, the parents are protesting.

00:29.837 --> 00:31.245
They want Marissa out.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074

00:44.494 --> 00:45.948
Who's ready for another fauxito?

00:46.275 --> 00:48.297
I think I kinda hit a wall on the mocktails.

00:49.324 --> 00:50.540
Besides, it's a school night.

00:50.625 --> 00:52.764
But it's not a school night. It's our last night

00:52.840 --> 00:56.004
before our last semester of our last year of high school.

00:56.084 --> 00:58.029
So we have to make it last.

00:58.298 --> 00:59.965
It's hard to argue with that logic.

01:00.639 --> 01:03.654
You guys, this has been a really fun winter break.

01:03.769 --> 01:04.602
Yeah.

01:04.691 --> 01:07.030
Just the four of us hanging out like old times.

01:07.116 --> 01:08.564
Yeah, I can't believe it's gone by so fast.

01:08.646 --> 01:12.013
I wish I could, like, TiVo it so we could play it over and over again until graduation.

01:12.099 --> 01:15.537
Well, unfortunately, after tonight it's back to regular scheduled programming.

01:15.628 --> 01:16.761
For you guys.

01:17.066 --> 01:19.717
I got to go back to Newport Union by myself.

01:21.714 --> 01:22.704
I got to pee.

01:22.818 --> 01:24.313
- You got to pee?
- No, not really.

01:24.407 --> 01:25.339
I got to pee.

01:25.459 --> 01:26.217
Okay.

01:26.350 --> 01:28.218
Screw it. I'll go get us some drinks first.

01:31.939 --> 01:33.554
What if it doesn't have to end?

01:33.579 --> 01:34.198
What, our break?

01:34.282 --> 01:36.231
No, the four of us being together.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.284
It's a new year, but it's our last chance.

01:38.388 --> 01:40.142
Senior photos are this Friday.

01:40.225 --> 01:44.690
The Harbor Class of 2006 will be immortalized in the yearbook for, like, all time.

01:44.777 --> 01:46.556
Marissa has to be part of that picture.

01:46.644 --> 01:47.896
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

01:47.980 --> 01:48.664
Yes.

01:48.749 --> 01:50.702
The dirty dean, he's gone, right?

01:50.777 --> 01:53.317
And Dr. Kim, she's always seemed pretty reasonable.

01:53.396 --> 01:55.970
Yeah, but the Board kicked out Marissa, not Dr. Kim.

01:56.048 --> 01:57.385
Plus there's all those concerned parents.

01:57.470 --> 01:59.621
Whatever! Out of sight, out of mind.

02:00.409 --> 02:02.182
Time heals all wounds.

02:03.076 --> 02:05.498
You love something, set it free, you know?

02:05.588 --> 02:06.916
Maybe they're over it.

02:07.012 --> 02:08.609
Yeah, this town's real forgiving.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.514
They're all out of fauxitos,

02:10.600 --> 02:13.477
so I got us a couple of fake Manhattans

02:13.563 --> 02:15.151
and a Safe Sex on The Beach.

02:15.245 --> 02:18.306
Ryan, what if the four of us can all finish senior year together?

02:18.413 --> 02:20.727
Summer's planning Operation Free Marissa.

02:20.836 --> 02:23.214
Yeah, secure some key allies. Go behind enemy lines.

02:23.283 --> 02:24.611
You been watching the War Channel again?

02:24.697 --> 02:26.201
Yes, it's the new Food Network.

02:26.906 --> 02:28.848
I'm always up for a little danger and intrigue.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.537
See?

02:30.382 --> 02:32.008
You guys seriously want to do this?

02:34.441 --> 02:37.219
Okay. All right. But we don't tell Marissa until we have a plan.

02:37.311 --> 02:39.576
Cheers. To getting Marissa back to where she belongs.

02:44.290 --> 02:46.079
Anyone have an idea how we do that?

03:26.087 --> 03:28.819
I cannot believe it is our last semester of high school.

03:28.913 --> 03:33.888
I know. College applications have been sent off, study, homework, learning.

03:33.988 --> 03:35.987
All the reasons to come here are pretty much irrelevant.

03:36.155 --> 03:39.162
Well, good. With all your free time, you can help out with Free Marissa.

03:39.424 --> 03:41.490
To what exactly are we freeing her from?

03:41.572 --> 03:43.648
Um, exile to public school,

03:43.743 --> 03:47.192
a year of solitude, ill-fitting gym shorts, mediocre lunches.

03:47.827 --> 03:48.704
Hey, there's Ryan.

03:48.814 --> 03:51.007
Hey. Can't talk. Got an appointment with Dr. Kim.

03:51.089 --> 03:52.062
What are you going to say?

03:52.159 --> 03:53.481
Just going to come right out and ask.

03:53.581 --> 03:55.877
All right. Direct approach. I like it. Good luck.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.576
Excellent. Prong One of the campaign has been initiated.

03:58.661 --> 04:01.394
You and I will take on Prong Two: grassroots movement.

04:01.477 --> 04:05.063
You know, information booth, petition, maybe a protest rally.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.894
How many prongs are involved in this operation?

04:06.990 --> 04:08.981
Dude, like, so many prongs.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.963
Ryan, come on in. What can I do for you?

04:14.042 --> 04:16.803
Dr. Kim, sorry I'm late. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about Marissa Cooper.

04:16.886 --> 04:18.389
Oh, how's she doing over at Union?

04:18.478 --> 04:21.173
Good, good. As good as can be expected.

04:21.262 --> 04:24.489
Um, actually, I was wondering if you might consider reinstating her this semester.

04:24.574 --> 04:25.013
Ryan...

04:25.111 --> 04:26.714
Her grades are good. She hasn't been in any trouble.

04:26.797 --> 04:30.205
Ryan,  I understand Marissa's expulsion seemed terribly unfair to you,

04:30.286 --> 04:32.909
and frankly, I wish the outcome had been different myself.

04:32.990 --> 04:34.265
Would you consider letting her reapply?

04:34.347 --> 04:37.317
Even if I wanted to, only the Board of Trustees has the power

04:37.365 --> 04:39.129
to readmit an expelled student.

04:39.214 --> 04:40.659
Okay, great. Can we meet with them?

04:40.767 --> 04:43.701
They're meeting on Thursday to discuss the new semester.

04:44.002 --> 04:45.298
It's a little late.

04:46.136 --> 04:46.940
But...

04:48.547 --> 04:51.626
Ah, I could probably get Marissa's case put on the docket.

04:51.680 --> 04:52.296
That would be great.

04:52.395 --> 04:54.489
Ryan, you'll be fighting an uphill battle.

04:54.575 --> 04:55.402
Wouldn't be the first time.

04:55.487 --> 04:57.485
They rarely reverse their decisions on anything.

04:57.576 --> 04:58.241
All we need is a chance.

04:58.328 --> 05:02.375
Students are not allowed to speak at Board meetings. You'll need a parent advocate.

05:02.460 --> 05:04.872
I think I know someone who'd be right for the job.

05:05.717 --> 05:06.843
Thank you, Doctor.

05:09.280 --> 05:12.256
You might want to check out the library for transcripts of an old meeting.

05:12.338 --> 05:13.675
There might be a precedent.

05:14.012 --> 05:18.246
Say, fall semester in 1996?

05:25.187 --> 05:26.055
Hey, Marissa.

05:26.486 --> 05:27.797
Johnny, hey.

05:28.257 --> 05:31.188
How was your break? I feel like I haven't seen you in forever.

05:31.301 --> 05:33.310
Ah,  you know, I've just been laying low since the operation.

05:33.394 --> 05:34.560
I already started physical therapy.

05:34.647 --> 05:35.358
That's great.

05:35.453 --> 05:36.573
Thanks. What have you been up to?

05:36.672 --> 05:41.249
Um, I don't know. Just hanging out with Seth and Summer, Ryan, doing nothing.

05:41.410 --> 05:42.868
It's kind of great, actually.

05:43.767 --> 05:49.499
Well, look, if you still got nothing to do, there's this thing I want you to go to with me.

05:49.601 --> 05:52.188
Uh, okay. What kind of thing?

05:52.315 --> 05:54.976
Um, it's a party, actually.

05:55.417 --> 06:00.123
See, Pac West is doing this big press event for their 2006 surf team on Thursday.

06:00.299 --> 06:01.482
The Pac West surf team?

06:01.558 --> 06:03.552
The coach called last night asking how the surgery went.

06:03.628 --> 06:07.716
Turns out one of their guys failed a drug test, so I got an alternate spot on the team.

06:07.791 --> 06:10.662
I can do my physio on the road and hopefully, compete by summer.

06:10.777 --> 06:13.100
Wow, that's amazing, Johnny.

06:13.195 --> 06:13.852
Thanks.

06:13.962 --> 06:17.564
Um, we're only allowed to bring one guest to the party, so...

06:18.599 --> 06:19.662
what do you say?

06:20.089 --> 06:24.220
Oh, I mean, shouldn't you take your mom or, I don't know, one of your entourage.

06:24.293 --> 06:25.517
I'm sure Chili's dying to go.

06:25.603 --> 06:26.813
I want you to go.

06:28.871 --> 06:32.570
I mean, none of this would be happening if it weren't for you.

06:34.493 --> 06:36.036
All right. Then I wouldn't miss it.

06:36.922 --> 06:39.110
Hey, I'm really happy for you, Johnny.

06:39.441 --> 06:40.211
Thanks.

06:41.637 --> 06:42.834
First meeting of a brand-new year.

06:42.920 --> 06:44.165
Of a brand-new enterprise.

06:44.251 --> 06:45.057
Let's begin.

06:45.104 --> 06:45.904
Okay.

06:48.510 --> 06:53.096
Divorced, divorced, separated, divorced.

06:53.210 --> 06:55.897
I didn't know there were so many broken marriages in this town. It's an epidemic.

06:55.986 --> 06:56.959
Speaking of which.

06:59.925 --> 07:01.810
Dr. Roberts is getting a divorce?

07:02.211 --> 07:03.428
You didn't hear it from me.

07:03.865 --> 07:04.771
I'm going to go say hi.

07:04.887 --> 07:06.215
He's been so good to Marissa.

07:09.135 --> 07:10.539
Hi, Neil. How are you?

07:11.007 --> 07:12.410
Hey, Julie.

07:13.225 --> 07:14.587
Happy New Year.

07:14.699 --> 07:16.590
Should  old acquaintance be forgot.

07:16.810 --> 07:21.242
I don't think that you're in much danger of being old or forgot anytime soon.

07:21.520 --> 07:22.572
You're too sweet.

07:22.930 --> 07:25.977
I never properly thanked you for having me over for Christmas dinner.

07:26.065 --> 07:26.813
It was a pleasure.

07:26.944 --> 07:29.526
It took the focus off of Gloria's conspicuous absence.

07:29.591 --> 07:32.616
Oh. You haven't told Summer about your separation?

07:32.717 --> 07:35.888
No. She thinks that Gloria didn't call because she's in some zen retreat.

07:35.982 --> 07:39.753
And Marissa thinks I'm supervising the longest condo renovation in history.

07:40.476 --> 07:43.320
I feel a couple of New Year's resolutions coming on.

07:45.082 --> 07:47.644
If we're going to launch a successful campaign to get Marissa back into Harbor,

07:47.721 --> 07:50.276
we have to find someone who can organize the masses.

07:50.390 --> 07:52.753
Someone who they'll follow, you know, into battle.

07:52.846 --> 07:54.051
You mean, General Townsend?

07:55.695 --> 07:56.774
Affirmative.

07:59.727 --> 08:01.706
Hey, Taylor. Hi, Madd. Hey, Ash.

08:01.811 --> 08:02.467
Madd, Ash.

08:02.579 --> 08:04.064
Summer, Seth, hi!

08:04.193 --> 08:07.658
Um, I left you guys a message about my Boxing Day party.

08:08.795 --> 08:11.643
I guess you didn't get it, though. But, like, how was your break? Awesome?

08:11.736 --> 08:15.197
Yes. So awesome, in fact, that we need your help with something.

08:15.281 --> 08:16.725
Oh, you want my help?

08:17.088 --> 08:19.491
Whatever you need. I'm there for you 110%.

08:19.579 --> 08:21.279
Oh, cool, 'cause we're launching a campaign.

08:21.376 --> 08:22.036
I love campaigns.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.697
To get Marissa back into Harbor.

08:25.380 --> 08:29.361
Oh, wow, that's... aggressive.

08:30.317 --> 08:31.065
Are you serious?

08:31.165 --> 08:34.448
Taylor, who out of our group would be better than you

08:34.520 --> 08:37.421
at winning over the hearts and minds of the student body?

08:37.985 --> 08:38.917
Did you say "our group"?

08:39.014 --> 08:40.174
Great. So you'll do it.

08:40.303 --> 08:42.013
It's an honor to share your foxhole.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.774
Okay, so we're going in front of the Trustees on Thursday.

08:46.862 --> 08:50.047
So I was thinking maybe you could, like, go home tonight and brainstorm.

08:50.118 --> 08:51.940
We could go over the plan at 0800?

08:52.036 --> 08:52.714
Sounds good.

08:52.803 --> 08:53.648
Thanks, friend.

08:54.138 --> 08:54.777
Bye.

08:56.947 --> 09:01.230
Oh, my God, Taylor, Marissa Cooper is, like, your number one rival.

09:01.319 --> 09:05.150
If she gets back into Harbor, she'll, like, totally socially crush you.

09:05.961 --> 09:08.920
Grow up, Ashley. That is so last semester.

09:09.023 --> 09:12.263
I hate to be the one to burst your popularity bubble,

09:12.351 --> 09:15.230
but isn't your mom still head of the Parents Association?

09:15.332 --> 09:15.984
So?

09:16.105 --> 09:21.214
So she's the one who started the petition to get Marissa kicked out in the first place.

09:21.746 --> 09:23.136
Also last semester.

09:25.272 --> 09:26.617
I'm sure she's totally over it.

09:26.707 --> 09:28.497
Your mom? Over it?

09:31.709 --> 09:36.418
And in 1996, the Board voted to reinstate a kid due to extenuating circumstances

09:36.504 --> 09:38.790
after he threatened another student with a knife.

09:39.124 --> 09:40.500
You've done your homework.

09:41.350 --> 09:42.636
So that's precedent, right?

09:42.727 --> 09:45.965
Yeah, but a precedent is just a small piece of a bigger puzzle.

09:46.196 --> 09:47.681
It doesn't guarantee anything.

09:48.164 --> 09:51.975
Look, if you're saying we don't have a case, then that's fine, I get it,

09:52.056 --> 09:56.639
but if this is because you don't want Marissa and me going to the same school,

09:57.113 --> 09:59.102
I promise you things are different now.

10:01.998 --> 10:04.505
You have a shot, but it's a long one.

10:04.552 --> 10:08.387
Okay. We need a parent advocate to address the Board.

10:08.598 --> 10:09.133
Would you?

10:09.235 --> 10:12.631
A good cause, poor odds, a chance to ruffle some Newpsie feathers?

10:12.747 --> 10:13.765
How could I say no?

10:13.874 --> 10:15.116
Who's the chairman this year?

10:17.088 --> 10:18.146
A guy named Mercer?

10:18.254 --> 10:19.019
Jim Mercer?

10:19.118 --> 10:19.985
Yeah, you know him?

10:20.076 --> 10:21.160
Yeah, he's a judge.

10:21.269 --> 10:23.217
I've argued before him many times.

10:23.308 --> 10:24.937
And that's a good thing, right?

10:25.932 --> 10:27.974
Well, he's what they call a "hanging judge."

10:28.229 --> 10:29.593
He's a real hard ass.

10:29.699 --> 10:31.767
Just means we'll have to present a really good case, that's all.

10:31.874 --> 10:32.695
Great.

10:34.142 --> 10:35.778
Now all we got to do is...

10:35.877 --> 10:38.286
Cross your fingers because it is all handled.

10:38.390 --> 10:40.873
Any luck, you'll be back at Harbor by Friday morning.

10:43.250 --> 10:46.048
Is that the good kind of speechless or the bad kind?

10:46.153 --> 10:49.514
Uh, good kind. I was just, "Wow." Could it really happen?

10:49.631 --> 10:51.256
It's no sure thing, but yeah.

10:51.355 --> 10:54.987
Look, I know that you just got settled at Union, you made a few friends.

10:55.366 --> 10:57.853
If you're happy where you are, I don't want to mess that up.

10:57.980 --> 10:59.205
Are you kidding?

10:59.518 --> 11:01.818
I'd love to finish high school with you guys.

11:01.919 --> 11:05.687
All right, I'm going to go grab dinner, check in with Sandy and I will call you later.

11:08.874 --> 11:09.948
Hey, when's the meeting?

11:10.051 --> 11:11.091
Uh, Thursday.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.737
Oh, this Thursday?

11:13.863 --> 11:15.550
Yeah.  Is that all right?

11:17.266 --> 11:18.362
Yeah.

11:26.404 --> 11:27.255
Hey.

11:27.716 --> 11:29.090
Hey, did you talk to Ryan?

11:29.482 --> 11:30.409
Yeah.

11:30.842 --> 11:33.712
Not exactly the triumphant enthusiasm I was expecting.

11:33.837 --> 11:37.461
I'm sorry. I really do appreciate everything you guys have been doing.

11:37.567 --> 11:38.089
But...?

11:38.191 --> 11:40.273
But, does anyone even want me back at Harbor?

11:40.377 --> 11:42.120
What, other than your three best friends?

11:42.232 --> 11:43.172
Well, what if it doesn't work?

11:43.280 --> 11:44.787
It's gonna work.

11:45.696 --> 11:47.914
And the meeting is this Thursday?

11:48.023 --> 11:49.557
Coop, what is going on?

11:49.662 --> 11:53.106
Well, it's just that Pac West is announcing Johnny as an alternate on their team that night

11:53.187 --> 11:56.141
and I kind of promised him I'd be there.

11:56.224 --> 11:58.478
Hmm. Well, that's really nice of you...

11:58.561 --> 12:00.171
but you're just going to have to cancel.

12:00.267 --> 12:01.109
Sorry.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.981
He'll be happy for you.

12:20.548 --> 12:24.106
The boys seem really excited about getting Marissa back into Harbor.

12:24.552 --> 12:25.770
Do you think she has a chance?

12:25.849 --> 12:27.514
Well, there's a good argument to be made.

12:27.616 --> 12:28.479
Morning.

12:28.586 --> 12:29.584
Morning.

12:29.702 --> 12:33.370
Oh! The boys have poster board and paint.

12:33.455 --> 12:35.458
I love student activism.

12:35.580 --> 12:38.068
Yeah. Did you get a chance to throw a call in to Judge Mercer?

12:38.166 --> 12:41.260
He's going to be out of town till Wednesday, but I did speak to another trustee

12:41.301 --> 12:44.358
who assured me that we'll be given a fair chance to present Marissa's case.

12:44.456 --> 12:47.410
All right. Well, uh, let us know if there's anything more we can do. We should get going.

12:47.514 --> 12:50.388
Yeah. Someone will kick our ass if we're late with our supply drop.

12:50.953 --> 12:51.658
Have fun.

12:51.719 --> 12:52.720
Thank you.

12:53.645 --> 12:57.181
This isn't the same Judge Mercer that jailed you for contempt?

12:57.265 --> 12:59.933
Six hours in the slammer because he didn't like my closing argument.

13:00.025 --> 13:03.474
And to this day, I still don't understand what it is I said to the guy

13:03.573 --> 13:04.958
th-that struck such a nerve.

13:05.026 --> 13:07.648
All I remember is that he hated you passionately.

13:08.567 --> 13:09.535
Maybe he won't remember.

13:09.615 --> 13:11.733
Not likely. And he's not out of town.

13:11.811 --> 13:12.899
He's ignoring me.

13:13.158 --> 13:16.267
Thinks anything a counselor has to say should be done on the record.

13:16.359 --> 13:19.066
Oh, come on. It's not like this is an actual trial.

13:19.512 --> 13:20.733
Tell that to Judge Mercer.

13:21.898 --> 13:24.013
I don't understand. Why do you need to see the Pac West doctor?

13:24.085 --> 13:26.738
Why can't they just have your doctor send over your charts and stuff?

13:26.814 --> 13:30.564
Something to do with their insurance. I'm sure it's just standard stuff.

13:31.401 --> 13:32.948
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

13:33.473 --> 13:35.510
Can I talk to you for a sec?

13:35.610 --> 13:39.461
Um,  if you want, man, I can give you a lift over to the doctor's at lunch.

13:39.551 --> 13:41.610
If you want, I can give you a lift anytime.

13:43.144 --> 13:44.931
I thought you were done with all the doctors.

13:45.014 --> 13:48.279
Ah, this is a routine post-op thing. It's no big deal.

13:48.739 --> 13:49.664
So what's up?

13:50.089 --> 13:54.434
Um... I, uh, I was gonna call you last night.

13:54.870 --> 13:57.640
I don't think I can make it to your party on Thursday.

13:58.427 --> 14:00.641
- You're not sure, or...
- No. No, I can't.

14:00.738 --> 14:03.388
See, there's this board meeting at my old school and...

14:03.720 --> 14:06.377
I kind of have to be there because they're going to decide

14:06.452 --> 14:08.679
whether or not I can reapply this semester.

14:09.572 --> 14:10.536
You're going back to private school?

14:10.627 --> 14:12.350
I  mean, it's not a done deal

14:12.908 --> 14:15.985
but, uh... yeah, I'm gonna try.

14:16.310 --> 14:17.505
That's great!

14:18.115 --> 14:20.751
Really? Cause I was worried you might be upset.

14:20.842 --> 14:22.367
Why? I mean, I'm happy for you.

14:22.459 --> 14:24.017
Great. Of course.

14:24.105 --> 14:27.577
Anyway, Chili will be stoked. You know, he was next in line for the party, so...

14:27.678 --> 14:29.104
I'm really sorry.

14:29.265 --> 14:30.677
You'll go to the next one.

14:31.572 --> 14:32.544
All right.

14:32.908 --> 14:33.951
I'll see you later.

14:39.364 --> 14:40.858
Okay, how many flyers do we have?

14:40.931 --> 14:42.356
Four stacks of 200.

14:42.477 --> 14:44.770
Okay, good. I want one of those on every locker by lunch,

14:44.860 --> 14:47.235
and you put the extras on bathroom stalls and mirrors.

14:47.321 --> 14:48.693
Um, any word on the T shirts?

14:48.799 --> 14:50.426
Uh, Ryan's supposed to get them at lunch.

14:50.513 --> 14:52.468
Great. I'm going to put some pressure on my button guy

14:52.558 --> 14:54.324
and see if I can get them done at the same time.

14:54.421 --> 14:56.191
Uh-oh. Fire in the hole.

14:58.236 --> 14:58.970
Taylor.

15:00.202 --> 15:01.021
Mom, what are you doing here?

15:01.108 --> 15:02.536
I just came from my pre-board meeting.

15:02.626 --> 15:03.462
Taylor's mom's on the board?

15:03.564 --> 15:06.896
Did you know there's a motion on the docket to reinstate Marissa Cooper?

15:08.114 --> 15:09.387
- Yes.
- Flyer.

15:14.035 --> 15:15.723
May I have a word with you?

15:19.409 --> 15:21.693
I don't know what she's saying, but it can't be good.

15:21.822 --> 15:23.858
How dare you do this without talking to me?

15:25.143 --> 15:28.404
I can read lips. Star magazine. "What stars are really saying."

15:28.593 --> 15:30.104
I'm helping my friends, Mom.

15:30.243 --> 15:32.087
Taylor, you don't have any friends.

15:32.219 --> 15:34.328
Which is one of the reasons why I had Marissa Cooper...

15:34.414 --> 15:36.259
...removed from the school in the first place.

15:36.353 --> 15:37.553
That's so demented.

15:40.498 --> 15:42.874
Oh, you dropped your... you dropped your... your flyer.

15:48.154 --> 15:51.021
I can't help you guys anymore. Sorry.

15:51.332 --> 15:52.407
Taylor!

15:54.670 --> 15:56.370
I guess that means no button guy.

15:56.406 --> 15:57.276
Oh, Seth!

15:57.379 --> 15:59.099
I just wanted to meet the button guy!

15:59.835 --> 16:02.668
I'm looking at a comp sheet that puts the property value at 12.

16:02.927 --> 16:04.215
Yeah, I'm meeting him right now.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.762
Okay, I'll call you back in 20.

16:06.433 --> 16:07.180
So.

16:08.053 --> 16:11.483
I say we put a cash bid on the Erbena Building at eleven five.

16:11.586 --> 16:13.809
I thought you said the Erbena Building was overvalued.

16:13.904 --> 16:17.143
That was before my guy found out Lockheed plans to build a new plant in the area.

16:17.221 --> 16:19.057
Oh, well done. Your guy?

16:19.242 --> 16:21.087
Yeah. I have a guy.

16:21.992 --> 16:23.868
Actually, he's your guy, too.

16:25.038 --> 16:27.643
Licensed Private Investigator, registered with the state.

16:27.774 --> 16:29.771
Completely legal. Above the board.

16:29.880 --> 16:32.390
Well, maybe he can dig up a little something on the Honorable Jim Mercer.

16:32.480 --> 16:32.899
Who's that?

16:32.997 --> 16:35.876
He's the head of the Harbor Board of Trustees, the person who has the final say

16:35.961 --> 16:37.585
on whether or not Marissa will be readmitted.

16:37.679 --> 16:38.573
I take it that's a problem?

16:38.677 --> 16:40.197
Oh, he's not a big fan of mine.

16:40.317 --> 16:41.550
- I'll put in a call.
- Whoa...

16:41.639 --> 16:44.517
Just a little background check. Just see what he comes up with. Be fun.

16:48.838 --> 16:49.962
- Hey.
- Hey!

16:50.324 --> 16:51.683
What are you doing here?

16:51.776 --> 16:55.041
I dropped by to give you an update and some campaign schwag. What do you think?

16:55.125 --> 16:58.517
Wow. I love it. What's next? Coffee mugs? Baseball caps?

16:58.599 --> 16:59.687
Yeah, whatever it takes.

16:59.806 --> 17:01.875
Seriously, I can't believe this is happening.

17:02.639 --> 17:04.648
Where's Johnny? Doesn't he usually eat with you?

17:04.751 --> 17:07.060
Yeah, well, he had a doctor's appointment.

17:07.164 --> 17:09.076
Oh, I guess Pac West's giving him a second chance.

17:09.172 --> 17:10.358
Really? That's great.

17:10.460 --> 17:12.920
Yeah. Everything's finally working out.

17:16.132 --> 17:17.035
Hello?

17:19.098 --> 17:20.686
Um, okay.

17:21.075 --> 17:22.146
Are you sure?

17:23.720 --> 17:26.923
Uh... okay. Well, then I'll come right now.

17:27.185 --> 17:27.906
All right.

17:28.457 --> 17:29.409
Everything all right?

17:29.555 --> 17:31.903
Uh... yeah, that was just Chili.

17:31.999 --> 17:35.354
I guess he's not feeling well, so I need to bring him this book.

17:35.461 --> 17:37.153
Wait. You need to bring him the book right now?

17:37.247 --> 17:38.053
Won't take me long.

17:38.151 --> 17:39.104
All right, well, I can drive you.

17:39.229 --> 17:42.316
No, you know, you should get back-- help someone on the front lines.

17:42.405 --> 17:44.170
I'll see you guys at the diner, okay?

17:44.267 --> 17:44.965
Yeah.

17:45.097 --> 17:46.083
Thanks for stopping by.

17:46.182 --> 17:46.974
Yeah.

17:54.465 --> 17:55.207
Ow.

17:58.594 --> 18:00.655
Don't tell me there's a problem with the T shirts or I might freak out.

18:00.733 --> 18:02.118
T shirts are fine. They're in the car.

18:02.214 --> 18:03.136
It's Marissa.

18:03.262 --> 18:05.734
She just came from union and she got a cal from Chili and took off.

18:05.830 --> 18:07.051
Something I should know?

18:07.225 --> 18:10.399
- Well, there might be a slight issue.
- Right.

18:10.489 --> 18:12.864
I mean, not like an issue issue. A friend issue.

18:12.961 --> 18:14.207
A Johnny issue.

18:14.924 --> 18:17.061
She's afraid she might be abandoning him.

18:17.159 --> 18:18.221
Ah, of course she is.

18:18.324 --> 18:21.944
Wait! Stand down, Private! It's the way she's wired.

18:22.141 --> 18:23.656
You wouldn't love her if she wasn't.

18:23.749 --> 18:26.467
She wants to come back here and she told Johnny just like she said she would.

18:26.569 --> 18:29.956
If you want to get mad and punch somebody or something...

18:30.111 --> 18:31.290
why not Taylor's mom?

18:31.426 --> 18:35.255
You need to get your ass back into gear. Start handing out some buttons.

18:51.166 --> 18:51.882
Neil.

18:51.992 --> 18:52.771
Julie.

18:52.904 --> 18:53.966
What a nice surprise.

18:54.106 --> 18:57.358
Yes, yes, it is. I mean, I didn't expect to see you at home.

18:57.475 --> 18:58.203
I'm looking for Marissa.

18:58.317 --> 18:59.830
Well, the girls aren't home from school yet.

19:00.016 --> 19:01.051
Why don't you come in?

19:02.539 --> 19:03.155
Please.

19:04.114 --> 19:06.395
So, no rhinos to plasty today?

19:07.389 --> 19:08.469
No, Gloria called.

19:08.563 --> 19:12.797
She wants her things sent to her sister's in Napa so I cleared my schedule.

19:13.102 --> 19:14.920
Thought I'd have that talk with Summer today.

19:15.026 --> 19:17.307
Oh. Aren't we too peas in a pod?

19:17.438 --> 19:19.270
Now that Marissa might go back to Harbor,

19:19.367 --> 19:22.812
the money I've saved for a new place will go to tuition.

19:22.948 --> 19:25.751
Kind of forces my hand with the trailer situation.

19:25.869 --> 19:27.367
I don't know what she's going to think.

19:27.487 --> 19:29.138
Well, I think she's going to be very grateful.

19:29.370 --> 19:32.207
Her mom making sacrifices for her future.

19:37.102 --> 19:38.063
Oh, yeah.

19:43.346 --> 19:44.639
Girls should be home.

19:45.703 --> 19:46.935
Should be home any minute.

19:49.860 --> 19:53.225
I think they were up most of the night last night working on that petition.

19:53.417 --> 19:54.357
They're so hopeful.

19:54.455 --> 19:56.361
And here we are about to ruin everything.

19:57.083 --> 19:57.972
Really?

19:58.909 --> 20:02.579
That's, uh... really selfish of us if you think about it, isn't it?

20:02.882 --> 20:06.966
Yeah. You know, I suppose I could wait a few days, you know?

20:07.057 --> 20:08.478
See how everything pans out.

20:08.550 --> 20:10.533
Seems like more of a weekend conversation, doesn't it?

20:10.628 --> 20:11.563
You are so right.

20:11.661 --> 20:13.861
You know... I could really go for a drink.

20:13.943 --> 20:15.054
You read my mind.

20:23.448 --> 20:24.770
Oh, my God.

20:27.605 --> 20:28.703
Where is he?

20:30.880 --> 20:31.899
Who knows?

20:32.169 --> 20:34.922
The Pac West doctors refused to sign off on his knee.

20:35.011 --> 20:37.976
Said it was too soon to tell whether or not he'll be back 100%.

20:38.093 --> 20:39.608
They're not going to let him tour.

20:42.099 --> 20:43.610
I've never seen him like this.

20:43.705 --> 20:44.876
Not even after the accident.

20:44.979 --> 20:46.108
Well, we've got to find him.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.373
And tell him what?

20:47.601 --> 20:49.393
Everything's going to be okay?

20:50.002 --> 20:53.242
The guy's future's trashed. He's pretty much lost everything.

20:59.247 --> 21:01.531
I don't know if he'll be able to make it back from this.

21:17.249 --> 21:21.424
I can't believe we spent all day canvassing and we only have, like, 13 signatures.

21:21.500 --> 21:24.055
Well, say what you want about Taylor, the girl's connected--

21:24.144 --> 21:27.176
cheerleaders, water polo players, the band.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.204
She turns, they all turn.

21:29.285 --> 21:33.047
All right, so it's down to the three of us, the AV Club and the comic book geeks.

21:33.150 --> 21:35.359
Actually, Leon's still a bit of a holdout.

21:35.470 --> 21:36.530
Wait, you guys...

21:36.725 --> 21:38.349
Shut up. Just act positive, okay?

21:38.457 --> 21:40.135
- Hey.
- We're so gonna rock that hearing.

21:40.412 --> 21:41.389
We really are.

21:41.480 --> 21:44.009
You guys, I don't think I can go.

21:44.595 --> 21:45.971
What? Why? What happened?

21:46.052 --> 21:49.098
Look, I really appreciate everything you guys have done,

21:49.177 --> 21:51.561
but I just don't think I can go back to Harbor.

22:06.533 --> 22:07.240
Hey.

22:07.364 --> 22:08.210
Hey.

22:09.380 --> 22:15.036
So, I know I didn't feel like talking about it last night, but I owe you an explanation.

22:15.955 --> 22:17.642
- It's Johnny.
- I kind of figured that.

22:17.738 --> 22:18.801
Don't be mad.

22:19.424 --> 22:20.495
I'm not mad.

22:21.349 --> 22:24.256
It's just, I wanted to come back to Harbor.

22:24.361 --> 22:27.582
Okay, so... so, what's wrong now?

22:27.676 --> 22:31.811
Well, Pac West just changed their mind. They're not letting him on the tour after all.

22:31.916 --> 22:33.153
He's really freaked out.

22:33.260 --> 22:34.603
You gotta stop making this your problem.

22:34.707 --> 22:36.313
But it is my problem.

22:36.420 --> 22:39.775
His girlfriend, the accident, getting kicked off the team...

22:39.876 --> 22:41.073
Are not your fault.

22:41.289 --> 22:43.287
You can't give up your one chance to go back to Harbor

22:43.376 --> 22:45.995
just so Johnny has someone to hang with in the hall.

22:46.087 --> 22:47.640
I never asked you to do this.

22:47.748 --> 22:51.063
So... you're saying we shouldn't have?

22:51.810 --> 22:53.908
No, and, uh...

22:54.694 --> 22:56.664
I don't know, I'm sorry.

22:59.707 --> 23:03.932
Well, we're meeting here before going to the school tonight.

23:05.361 --> 23:06.627
Just so you know.

23:13.033 --> 23:14.482
My guy came through on your judge.

23:14.580 --> 23:17.959
Don't have to use it if you don't want to, but it's interesting.

23:18.992 --> 23:21.143
And not irrelevant to the matter at hand.

23:21.283 --> 23:22.228
Tell me the short version.

23:22.329 --> 23:23.917
The judge has a son, Nick.

23:24.768 --> 23:25.912
He's got a drug problem.

23:26.012 --> 23:29.176
He got kicked out of military school for using. Nobody's heard from him since.

23:31.701 --> 23:34.707
The case where he and I squared off, I was defending a kid like that.

23:34.800 --> 23:37.521
Well, if the judge wants to play hardball with Ryan's girlfriend,

23:37.603 --> 23:39.182
at least you have some ammunition.

23:39.260 --> 23:40.228
To what?

23:40.625 --> 23:42.700
To exploit his family's tragedy?

23:42.877 --> 23:44.857
To embarrass him in front of the community?

23:45.040 --> 23:46.020
I just thought you'd want to know.

23:46.106 --> 23:47.069
I do.

23:47.371 --> 23:48.271
Thank you.

23:48.833 --> 23:49.993
It's gonna be tricky.

23:50.178 --> 23:53.219
And there'll be four very disappointed kids if I make a wrong move.

23:54.067 --> 23:56.410
Free Marissa. Help Marissa get back into Harbor.

23:56.494 --> 23:57.542
And sign our petition.

23:57.638 --> 23:58.930
Sign this, geek.

24:00.912 --> 24:02.083
I'm not going to sign his genitals.

24:02.181 --> 24:04.089
Okay, we are, like, getting crushed.

24:04.199 --> 24:06.090
I just don't understand why this is happening.

24:06.199 --> 24:08.026
I mean, even if people don't really like Marissa...

24:08.122 --> 24:10.457
What, whoa, everybody likes Marissa.

24:10.553 --> 24:12.541
Well, even if they didn't, they could still sign the petition.

24:12.651 --> 24:13.667
What do they care if she goes here?

24:13.769 --> 24:15.292
Well, that's the point. They don't care.

24:15.392 --> 24:18.452
This school is apathetic. They need someone who can inspire,

24:18.540 --> 24:19.890
someone who can intimidate.

24:19.984 --> 24:21.061
They need Taylor.

24:21.764 --> 24:22.592
Yeah.

24:23.032 --> 24:26.024
You know, maybe it's better to be feared than loved.

24:26.120 --> 24:28.770
Cohen, you have my permission to do whatever it takes.

24:28.861 --> 24:29.379
And what is it?

24:29.478 --> 24:32.112
I'm picturing, like, Indecent Proposal.

24:32.216 --> 24:36.242
You're Demi, naturally, and Taylor is the leather-faced guy who talks to horses.

24:36.338 --> 24:37.773
You want me to trade sex for signatures?

24:37.872 --> 24:38.857
Get her on board.

24:38.957 --> 24:41.041
I need Marissa back at this school.

24:43.630 --> 24:45.233
I feel so dirty.

24:52.684 --> 24:54.385
I'm not going to school today, Mom.

24:54.483 --> 24:57.737
Mom just left for work. She let me in on her way out.

25:00.420 --> 25:02.256
Marissa told me you left the tour.

25:03.541 --> 25:04.606
I'm sorry, man.

25:05.700 --> 25:08.337
She send you to... check up on me?

25:08.436 --> 25:09.642
She doesn't know I'm here.

25:09.817 --> 25:11.293
She's the reason I came.

25:12.381 --> 25:13.537
Is she okay?

25:13.748 --> 25:15.170
That depends on how you look at it.

25:15.269 --> 25:19.365
She's... she's decided to stay at Newport Union.

25:22.860 --> 25:24.930
You private school kids find it hard to believe.

25:25.015 --> 25:27.048
First of all, I don't need you lecturing me about public school.

25:27.136 --> 25:29.722
Second of all, she's not staying for the quality of the education.

25:29.813 --> 25:31.186
She's staying for you.

25:32.611 --> 25:34.395
Well, I didn't ask her to do anything.

25:34.490 --> 25:35.872
You didn't have to.

25:40.150 --> 25:42.315
No matter what anyone says,

25:42.777 --> 25:44.819
it's still going to be her choice.

25:45.702 --> 25:48.371
Just wants to make sure she feels free to make it.

26:01.576 --> 26:02.522
Sandy?

26:03.732 --> 26:04.471
Hey.

26:04.699 --> 26:06.287
Well, you have lunch yet?

26:06.428 --> 26:11.784
I was signing a new client at the deli, and I picked you up a turkey pastrami on rye.

26:11.875 --> 26:12.524
With mustard?

26:12.625 --> 26:13.476
Spicy Dijon.

26:13.571 --> 26:14.557
My hero.

26:23.902 --> 26:24.794
Bad day?

26:25.854 --> 26:27.844
I've been faced with an ethical dilemma.

26:27.936 --> 26:30.984
Well, if I do say so, my ethics are excellent.

26:31.310 --> 26:32.107
Try me.

26:33.642 --> 26:34.595
Judge Mercer.

26:34.964 --> 26:38.001
Ah, the one who hates you and tried to get you disbarred.

26:38.102 --> 26:39.120
The very one.

26:39.371 --> 26:41.798
Turns out he's the father of a junkie.

26:42.252 --> 26:44.501
His kid got kicked out of school

26:44.775 --> 26:46.774
and he fell right off the map.

26:47.197 --> 26:51.626
And you think you can use this information to shame him into helping Marissa.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.842
The thought has crossed my mind.

26:55.163 --> 26:59.951
Well, what would you do if you were still a public defender,

27:00.038 --> 27:01.551
and Marissa was your client?

27:10.074 --> 27:10.906
Taylor.

27:11.094 --> 27:12.169
Hey, we need to talk.

27:12.291 --> 27:15.339
I would like to talk to you about anything but Marissa Cooper...

27:15.429 --> 27:17.549
I have been sanctioned to offer you sexual favors.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.892
I swear, Summer said it was okay.

27:20.675 --> 27:21.592
Wow.

27:23.072 --> 27:26.606
Anything else, you would be facing a long night involving

27:26.700 --> 27:30.570
candle wax, tube socks and a new Fiona Apple CD.

27:31.498 --> 27:33.666
But Marissa, I can't.

27:33.763 --> 27:37.201
Okay, well, lucky for both of us, I've optioned to forgo man whoring

27:37.275 --> 27:40.066
and make an appeal to your heart because I know that you have one.

27:40.175 --> 27:40.926
Seth, don't.

27:41.034 --> 27:42.466
Well, I am your friend.

27:42.597 --> 27:44.473
So is Summer and so is Ryan.

27:44.566 --> 27:46.786
And if Marissa came back, you'd have her, too.

27:46.884 --> 27:48.405
Okay, you don't get it.

27:48.525 --> 27:49.862
My mom's a sports agent.

27:49.973 --> 27:51.274
Your mom's a sports agent?

27:51.368 --> 27:53.123
I thought she was just a bored, bitter Newpsie.

27:53.223 --> 27:55.077
She's a bored, bitter ball-buster.

27:55.243 --> 27:59.011
300-pound football players go to her when they need something done.

28:01.879 --> 28:03.352
She threatened to take away my car.

28:03.460 --> 28:05.039
- I'll give you a ride to school.
- Not to pay for college.

28:05.134 --> 28:06.474
You can get a scholarship.

28:09.077 --> 28:10.036
I'm sorry.

28:10.280 --> 28:13.276
Fine, but as your friend, I'm going to beg you to do one thing.

28:13.382 --> 28:17.234
Do not grow up to be like your mom, 'cause you're too good for that.

28:32.441 --> 28:34.483
I don't want any pigeon pie, Gus.

28:36.484 --> 28:38.884
I think it's terrible what you do to those little birds.

28:40.895 --> 28:42.865
Neil! Wow, uh...

28:42.976 --> 28:44.538
This is a surprise.

28:45.966 --> 28:47.623
Well, I figured I owed you one.

28:48.719 --> 28:52.161
Wow, so this is what one of these looks like on the inside, huh?

28:52.435 --> 28:55.289
Mmm... pork rinds.

28:55.559 --> 28:57.837
Uh, yeah, well, when in Rome...

28:57.929 --> 28:59.807
Well, I thought you'd be dressed and ready to go to the hearing.

28:59.893 --> 29:01.130
I was hoping you might need a ride.

29:01.230 --> 29:03.507
Oh, thank you. Um...

29:04.430 --> 29:07.649
But, uh, truthfully, I don't think I'm gonna go.

29:08.228 --> 29:10.569
I think Marissa just might be better off without me.

29:10.662 --> 29:11.792
That's nonsense.

29:11.904 --> 29:13.458
Every girl needs her mom.

29:13.647 --> 29:15.111
And I'm going to be in your corner.

29:15.381 --> 29:17.438
I give a lot of money to that school.

29:20.464 --> 29:21.945
Give me five minutes.

29:25.025 --> 29:29.216
Um, I'll just... take these and I'll be outside,

29:29.320 --> 29:32.111
trading stock tips with your friend Gus, huh?

29:39.286 --> 29:40.538
No word back from Taylor.

29:40.627 --> 29:43.228
We gotta leave in an hour and no sign of Marissa.

29:43.569 --> 29:45.182
So what are you guys saying?

29:45.503 --> 29:47.330
That this was a valiant campaign.

29:47.421 --> 29:48.496
Yeah, really valiant.

29:48.595 --> 29:50.481
One every general would be proud of.

29:50.601 --> 29:53.571
Surrender much? I bet Napoleon never talked like this.

29:53.657 --> 29:56.317
Well, maybe he should have, right before he was defeated and exiled.

29:56.408 --> 29:59.348
Summer, my little empress, this is our Waterloo.

29:59.451 --> 30:02.139
We have to retreat and minimize collateral damage.

30:02.268 --> 30:05.816
Well, can't we just wait a couple of minutes before we raise the white flag?

30:05.932 --> 30:09.496
She's always late. I mean, maybe she got lost or something.

30:18.361 --> 30:19.261
Marissa.

30:19.887 --> 30:21.746
Hey, aren't you supposed to be at that Harbor thing?

30:21.869 --> 30:24.143
No, but hey, have you seen Johnny?

30:24.245 --> 30:25.645
'Cause I've been looking for him all day.

30:25.747 --> 30:28.101
I know, it's crazy, right? I actually gotta go right now.

30:28.196 --> 30:29.799
Otherwise, I'd be late for the Pac West thing.

30:29.885 --> 30:31.577
Wait, what Pac West thing?

30:31.743 --> 30:33.513
You haven't talked to Johnny at all?

30:34.857 --> 30:38.879
Well, it turns out that that fancy surgeon that you hooked him up with

30:38.964 --> 30:41.089
went to med school with the Pac West doctor.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.883
He put in a call and convinced the guy that Johnny would make a full recovery,

30:43.978 --> 30:45.310
and he's back on the team.

30:45.399 --> 30:46.552
I can't believe he didn't tell me.

30:46.653 --> 30:49.057
Uh, it's been insane. They want him to leave next month.

30:49.134 --> 30:52.155
I guess they hired him some tutor that's supposed to help you with the GED.

30:52.243 --> 30:54.765
I've already hit up my dad for frequent flyer miles so I can tag along.

30:54.868 --> 30:55.812
You're going, too?

30:55.905 --> 30:57.836
Ah, yes, it's a chance of a lifetime.

30:58.918 --> 31:02.500
But, uh, anyways, it's kind of funny how it all worked out, huh?

31:02.600 --> 31:05.938
I mean, Johnny and I hitting the road, you going back to your old school.

31:08.748 --> 31:11.488
Yeah. Hey, I gotta go.

31:11.596 --> 31:13.652
But if you see Johnny, will you congratulate him for me?

31:13.749 --> 31:14.550
I will.

31:39.240 --> 31:42.844
Summer, we can't wait any longer. Marissa's not coming.

31:44.810 --> 31:46.705
Okay, fine.

31:47.011 --> 31:48.856
All right, I'll tell Sandy.

31:49.739 --> 31:51.477
Sandy's waiting in the car.

31:52.734 --> 31:54.892
I told him we'd be right out. You guys ready?

31:56.135 --> 31:56.919
Yeah.

32:08.719 --> 32:10.434
Thanks so much for doing this.

32:10.527 --> 32:11.657
Really, it really means a lot.

32:11.787 --> 32:15.890
Ornery judge, captive audience... righteousness on my side. I feel right at home.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.584
This is what you do. You'll be great.

32:18.875 --> 32:19.869
Judge Mercer.

32:19.986 --> 32:20.917
Sandy Cohen.

32:21.438 --> 32:22.501
I know who you are.

32:22.978 --> 32:26.064
Be a cold day in hell, Cohen. I'm looking forward to this.

32:27.712 --> 32:30.033
Oh, yeah. You got to bury him.

32:33.519 --> 32:34.334
Sandy...

32:34.680 --> 32:36.195
Hi, Kirsten. Sorry to bother you both.

32:36.901 --> 32:38.371
We're about to start here.

32:38.470 --> 32:40.184
Yeah, I know. I think you want to hear this.

32:40.288 --> 32:40.936
All right.

32:41.269 --> 32:41.992
Be right back.

32:45.124 --> 32:47.993
Mom... Mom, please, if you want to do this, it's your decision,

32:48.089 --> 32:50.499
but don't make me face my friends while you do it.

32:50.601 --> 32:52.962
Taylor, you are either with me or against me.

32:53.056 --> 32:54.190
Now which is it?

32:55.409 --> 32:57.751
I have to go to the little girls' room.

32:59.389 --> 33:01.261
Dr. Kim... can I have a word with you?

33:01.367 --> 33:02.437
Yes, Veronica.

33:03.159 --> 33:04.450
I had my guy keep digging.

33:04.564 --> 33:06.903
I've been thinking about this. I don't know.

33:09.618 --> 33:10.536
Oh...

33:11.383 --> 33:12.318
Tell me everything.

33:12.426 --> 33:14.701
- Hey, Taylor, it's Seth.
- And Summer.

33:14.810 --> 33:16.205
Hi, Seth and Summer.

33:16.469 --> 33:19.505
So we were kind of hoping we might see you here at the meeting.

33:19.676 --> 33:21.128
Yeah. Uh...

33:23.381 --> 33:24.155
No.

33:25.134 --> 33:26.217
Sorry, guys.

33:27.210 --> 33:28.970
I know you must be really mad at me.

33:29.089 --> 33:31.297
No, it's okay. It's your mom, we get it.

33:31.829 --> 33:34.005
Well, listen, thanks for trying. We'll just, uh...

33:34.577 --> 33:36.213
we'll let you know how everything goes.

33:36.312 --> 33:37.243
Thanks.

33:38.298 --> 33:39.548
That's really nice.

33:44.597 --> 33:46.934
Look, speak of the devil-- literally.

33:51.006 --> 33:53.088
Neil, always a pleasure.

33:53.276 --> 33:55.560
Veronica, you know Julie Cooper Nichol?

33:55.682 --> 33:56.263
Hi.

33:56.377 --> 33:57.264
Of course.

33:57.440 --> 34:00.444
Marissa's a real chip off the old block, isn't she?

34:01.062 --> 34:02.925
I couldn't agree with you more--

34:03.248 --> 34:06.487
brains, beauty and a flair for fashion.

34:07.233 --> 34:08.232
Excuse me.

34:12.387 --> 34:14.078
Maybe this was a bad idea.

34:14.179 --> 34:16.797
Good evening. Thank you all for coming.

34:17.186 --> 34:19.226
I see it's a full house tonight.

34:19.335 --> 34:23.706
And I think we all know what, or should I say who, brought in the crowd.

34:23.822 --> 34:27.592
So why don't we just start with the matter of Marissa Cooper.

34:27.695 --> 34:30.896
Ms. Townsend, you were speaking on behalf of the Parents' Association.

34:30.920 --> 34:32.196
Would you care to open?

34:32.931 --> 34:34.032
Where's Dad?

34:34.312 --> 34:35.320
He'll be right back.

34:35.431 --> 34:36.568
Thank you, Judge Mercer.

34:37.520 --> 34:43.039
As I'm sure you all know, Marissa Cooper shot a boy in the back.

34:43.150 --> 34:46.538
As head of the Parents' Association and a concerned parent myself,

34:46.643 --> 34:50.472
I can tell you, this is not what the parents want.

34:50.627 --> 34:52.674
And this is not what the Harbor students want either.

34:52.768 --> 34:53.937
Yes, it is.

34:55.870 --> 34:57.683
Sit down, young lady.

34:57.809 --> 34:59.958
Children are not permitted to address the board.

35:00.058 --> 35:03.957
But they're allowed to address each other, right?

35:05.622 --> 35:08.496
Taylor, why don't you show us what you've got?

35:08.728 --> 35:12.661
It's a petition with over 300 signatures.

35:12.772 --> 35:15.511
Basically, the entire student body.

35:23.939 --> 35:28.262
Well, this is all well and good, but Ms. Townsend is correct.

35:28.384 --> 35:31.603
Students do not make the decisions on these matters.

35:31.724 --> 35:33.594
Well, I am not a student.

35:33.694 --> 35:38.363
And I would like to tell everyone here that Marissa has shown such dignity and maturity

35:38.462 --> 35:40.028
throughout this entire nightmare.

35:40.129 --> 35:42.364
Of course you think so. You're her mother.

35:42.474 --> 35:46.507
You're absolutely right, Veronica, so I'll speak on behalf of Ms. Cooper.

35:46.961 --> 35:49.295
Go, Dr. Roberts.

35:49.398 --> 35:51.376
Right... you... Sorry, sir.

35:52.897 --> 35:55.663
Marissa Cooper has been living in my home for the past few months.

35:55.773 --> 35:57.983
So I can say without hesitation

35:58.576 --> 36:01.329
that this young lady would make any father proud

36:01.417 --> 36:03.652
and this school would be lucky to have her.

36:04.244 --> 36:06.573
Well, that's a nice sentiment, Dr. Roberts,

36:06.743 --> 36:09.923
and this student petition is certainly meaningful, but I don't think

36:10.018 --> 36:13.246
I can advise the board to break precedent here.

36:13.355 --> 36:17.057
This school has never readmitted a student

36:17.147 --> 36:20.161
who has been expelled for reasons relating to violence.

36:20.265 --> 36:23.304
Uh, that's not exactly true.

36:23.413 --> 36:24.623
There is precedent.

36:24.734 --> 36:25.783
He's right.

36:25.913 --> 36:31.153
Um... ten years ago, a case not all that different from Marissa's--

36:31.255 --> 36:35.149
it was knife, not a gun, but the incident occurred on campus.

36:35.259 --> 36:39.065
And after no criminal charges were filed, the expulsion was reversed.

36:39.169 --> 36:43.639
The students of this school need to respect the sanctity of this hearing and shut up.

36:43.833 --> 36:45.482
Unfortunately...

36:47.012 --> 36:50.138
even though this young man is speaking out of turn,

36:50.693 --> 36:51.751
he's right.

36:53.502 --> 36:55.926
But I still don't have to reinstate.

36:56.073 --> 36:59.627
You don't have to reinstate, but... you might want to.

36:59.735 --> 37:01.624
Enlighten me, Mr. Cohen.

37:01.739 --> 37:03.299
Why would I want to do that?

37:04.701 --> 37:07.731
'Cause sometimes a good kid goes through a rough time.

37:08.569 --> 37:11.461
And we might think by closing a door to her,

37:11.655 --> 37:13.005
or to him...

37:13.177 --> 37:14.868
we're teaching a lesson.

37:15.305 --> 37:17.910
And when that child needs us the most,

37:19.325 --> 37:20.828
we're not there for them.

37:23.128 --> 37:27.167
There isn't a person in this room that thinks Marissa Cooper is a threat to anyone...

37:27.265 --> 37:29.297
or that she wasn't a model student.

37:29.423 --> 37:31.343
Nor that she wouldn't continue to be.

37:32.501 --> 37:34.197
So what are we doing here?

37:35.359 --> 37:39.326
Instead of proving a point, let's right a wrong.

37:40.182 --> 37:46.150
It's so rare in life that anyone gets a second chance.

37:57.473 --> 37:59.434
The board has reached its' verdict.

37:59.534 --> 38:05.809
And with only one dissenting vote, we've decided to let Marissa Cooper graduate.

38:22.736 --> 38:25.825
Um, do you guys think that I could get a ride home?

38:25.954 --> 38:27.653
Ooh... no, yeah, we can manage that.

38:27.680 --> 38:28.171
Okay.

38:28.227 --> 38:30.887
A ride? Hell no, sister, you're sleeping over.

38:41.886 --> 38:42.808
Your Honor...

38:43.361 --> 38:45.426
This isn't a courtroom, Mr. Cohen.

38:45.542 --> 38:48.866
Right. Well... I just wanted to say thank you.

38:48.981 --> 38:50.447
I know what you were doing.

38:50.827 --> 38:52.370
But you made your case.

38:52.644 --> 38:56.419
And I appreciate that you've kept your information just between us.

38:56.620 --> 38:57.844
I, uh...

38:59.243 --> 39:00.732
I know where he is.

39:00.980 --> 39:01.610
What?

39:01.704 --> 39:04.322
A private detective tracked him down to Los Angeles.

39:04.445 --> 39:05.593
He's safe.

39:06.329 --> 39:08.607
My friend brought him to this shelter.

39:12.953 --> 39:14.847
He said he'd like to see you.

39:17.238 --> 39:18.407
Thank you.

39:26.651 --> 39:27.906
My hero.

39:35.009 --> 39:36.696
Thanks for being here, Mom.

39:37.184 --> 39:41.357
Oh, Marissa... I feel like I've let you down in so many ways.

39:41.462 --> 39:43.342
That's really not true.

39:43.980 --> 39:46.858
There is no condo. No renovations.

39:47.018 --> 39:50.419
I live in a trailer park. I was too ashamed to tell you.

39:51.093 --> 39:54.434
Wow, well... I knew there was something, but...

39:55.287 --> 39:57.203
Look, I'll come home whenever you want.

39:57.309 --> 39:58.434
Oh, sweetheart.

40:01.992 --> 40:06.248
Thanks, Dad. That was pretty cool of you, standing up for Marissa like that.

40:06.476 --> 40:09.147
Too bad Gloria wasn't here to see you in action.

40:09.705 --> 40:10.668
Yeah.

40:14.421 --> 40:15.947
Listen, sweetheart, um...

40:16.486 --> 40:19.795
I don't think your stepmom's going to be coming back.

40:20.527 --> 40:21.805
I'm sorry, Dad.

40:22.379 --> 40:26.368
But you didn't have to be so scared to tell me. I mean, we do okay, right?

40:26.994 --> 40:27.933
Right.

40:31.003 --> 40:33.342
I think that we are going to go to the diner.

40:33.444 --> 40:34.209
So I'll see you later.

40:34.321 --> 40:35.085
Coop!

40:37.258 --> 40:38.410
Have fun, you guys.

40:40.882 --> 40:44.238
You know, all things considered, I think I raised a pretty good kid.

40:44.339 --> 40:45.950
Mm, I think we both did.

40:47.611 --> 40:48.866
- You want a...?
- Drink?

40:49.005 --> 40:50.012
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:51.647 --> 40:52.805
Uh, hey.

40:53.358 --> 40:56.727
So... what changed your mind about coming back here?

40:56.828 --> 41:00.661
Well, Johnny got put on the Pac West tour and Chili said he was going to go with him

41:00.751 --> 41:03.392
so it just seemed kind of stupid to stay at Union by myself.

41:03.503 --> 41:04.425
Right.

41:04.580 --> 41:05.588
It wasn't me?

41:06.184 --> 41:06.945
Nope.

41:07.065 --> 41:08.417
- A little bit?
- Okay, a little.

41:08.521 --> 41:10.827
- Coop, Atwood, come on!
- I'm coming.

41:10.922 --> 41:12.037
Why don't I meet you at the diner?

41:12.138 --> 41:13.819
Okay, all right, I'll see you there.

41:26.865 --> 41:27.998
Called your house.

41:28.173 --> 41:29.536
Your mom said you'd be here.

41:30.489 --> 41:32.433
Told her I was really happy for you,

41:33.392 --> 41:35.056
getting back on the team.

41:40.093 --> 41:41.420
Yeah, well...

41:42.477 --> 41:44.146
just lucky I guess.

41:45.211 --> 41:46.151
Thank you.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.933
She deserves to be happy.

41:55.024 --> 41:56.463
All right, we'll see you around.

41:57.874 --> 41:59.043
Yeah, sure.

42:00.428 --> 42:01.450
See ya.
