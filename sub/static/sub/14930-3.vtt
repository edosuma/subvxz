WEBVTT

00:05.973 --> 00:07.641
TAYA, I KNOW YOU'RE THERE.

00:07.675 --> 00:10.811
I CAN HEAR YOUR BREATH.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.680
YOUR WARM BREATH...

00:12.713 --> 00:17.285
JETTING FROM YOUR
TINY FLARED NOSTRILS.

00:18.186 --> 00:21.589
MY BLOOD CALLS OUT
TO YOUR BLOOD.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.824
HEAR IT?

00:23.857 --> 00:24.592
HMM?

00:24.625 --> 00:27.828
CAN YOU HEAR
MY BLOOD CALLING YOU?

00:27.861 --> 00:30.131
I CAN HEAR IT.

00:30.664 --> 00:33.401
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN THERE?

00:33.434 --> 00:35.303
SINCE THE NOSTRILS.

00:35.336 --> 00:37.238
JIMMY, YOU HAVE
TO CUT THIS OUT.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.073
YOU'RE BEING
A TOTAL PERV.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.808
FINE. ALL RIGHT?
I'M A PERV.

00:40.841 --> 00:43.244
I'M WEIRD.
I'VE GOT THIS
CRAZY OBSESSION.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.512
I'M A SELF-ABUSING
HERMIT.

00:44.545 --> 00:45.746
WHY WON'T YOU JUST
LEAVE ME ALONE?

00:45.779 --> 00:48.182
JIMMY, I JUST THINK
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT.

00:48.216 --> 00:51.419
NO. THIS IS
PRETTY MUCH IT.

00:52.686 --> 00:56.124
DAMN. BRAD'S
OVER THERE AGAIN.

00:56.157 --> 00:59.127
BRAD? WHAT WOULD BRAD
BE DOING OVER THERE?

00:59.160 --> 01:01.395
OH. LOTS OF THINGS.
LOOK.

01:01.429 --> 01:05.633
ON TUESDAY HE WAS
THERE FROM 6:15
UNTIL 7:43.

01:05.666 --> 01:08.169
OH, MY GOD!
YOU PERV!

01:08.202 --> 01:10.571
GIVE ME THOSE.

01:15.909 --> 01:19.713
OH! HE'S USING
HIS SEXY GUY VOICE.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.450
AND SHE'S
LAUGHING AT IT!

01:22.483 --> 01:23.851
I TAUGHT HIM THAT VOICE.

01:23.884 --> 01:27.788
SHE IS LAUGHING AT
MY SEXY GUY VOICE!

01:28.622 --> 01:30.891
WAIT. THEY'VE
STOPPED TALKING.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.127
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

01:33.827 --> 01:34.695
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

01:34.728 --> 01:37.131
I COULD USE TO LOOK IN
THERE WITH, DO YOU?

01:37.165 --> 01:41.302
GIVE ME A LITTLE CREDIT
HERE, LILY.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.104
FINE.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.274
HERE.

01:53.281 --> 01:55.416
HI, GUYS.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.417
HI, LILY.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.152
WH

01:58.186 --> 02:00.921
I--I WAS TRYING
TO KILL A WASP.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.157
WHAT'S WITH THE MIRROR?

02:03.191 --> 02:04.024
OK. YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:04.057 --> 02:05.092
I'VE ANSWERED
ENOUGH OF YOUR
QUESTIONS.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.695
I WAS TRYING
TO DO YOU A FAVOR,
BUT FORGET ABOUT IT.

02:07.728 --> 02:10.931
WHEN THERE'S A WHOLE
HIVE OF WASPS LIVING
UNDER YOUR BED,

02:10.964 --> 02:14.435
DON'T COME
TO ASK TO BORROW
MY MIRROR STICK!

02:14.468 --> 02:16.170
HI, TAYA.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.173
I WASN'T A LESBIAN.

02:19.207 --> 02:20.808
I WAS EXPERIMENTING.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.277
EVERYONE EXPERIMENTS
IN COLLEGE.

02:23.311 --> 02:25.313
RIGHT, CLAUDIA?

02:26.914 --> 02:30.284
WELL, UH...I'M
REALLY JUST TAKING
A FEW CLASSES

02:30.318 --> 02:31.885
AND, UH..
AND I'M MARRIED.

02:31.919 --> 02:32.986
AND PREGNANT.

02:33.020 --> 02:38.559
BUT, UH...I'M SURE
SOME OF MY OTHER
CLASSMATES ARE...

02:40.261 --> 02:42.963
YOU KNOW, HA HA.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.332
WELL, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY GET GOING.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.966
Claudia:
ARE YOU GUYS
GOING OUT TONIGHT?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.302
YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO
A POETRY SLAM DOWNTOWN.

02:48.336 --> 02:49.970
COOL. I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE INTO POETRY.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.640
WELL, HE WASN'T,
BUT THEN I TOOK HIM
TO ONE LAST WEEK

02:52.673 --> 02:54.708
AND IT'S TOTALLY
OPENED UP HIS MIND.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.677
I THINK THAT'S
GREAT!

02:56.710 --> 02:58.346
YEAH. IT'S DEEP, SEAN.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.313
OH, I BET IT'S DEEP.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.515
I BET YOU IT WENT SO DEEP
IT PUT YOU TO SLEEP.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.684
WHETHER YOU BE FLYIN'
RED OR BLUE,

03:03.717 --> 03:05.486
YOU OWN SOMETHIN'
THAT DON'T BELONG TO YOU.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.620
WAKE UP, AMERICA.

03:06.654 --> 03:09.590
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD STUFF.
YOU SHOULD GET INTO IT.

03:09.623 --> 03:13.294
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO MISS
HILDY, THE HAIKU POET.

03:13.327 --> 03:14.995
WE SHOULD DO THIS
AGAIN SOON.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.730
DEFINITELY. YEAH,
LET'S MAKE PLANS.

03:16.764 --> 03:19.267
DEFINITELY. DEFINITELY. OK?

03:19.300 --> 03:20.768
NEVER AGAIN.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.503
WHAT? THAT WAS FUN.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.238
BABY, IT WASN'T.
SHE'S HORRIBLE!

03:24.272 --> 03:25.906
OH, WHAT IS
SO HORRIBLE ABOUT HER?

03:25.939 --> 03:28.376
JUST THE WAY SHE IS
AND THE WAY SHE
DOES THINGS.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.710
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK, HUH?

03:29.743 --> 03:32.713
LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK AT HOW SHE PARKS.

03:32.746 --> 03:33.614
SHE MUST BE STOPPED.

03:33.647 --> 03:34.815
I'M TELLING YOU!
YOU DON'T THINK IT'S RUDE

03:34.848 --> 03:37.751
THAT SHE PARKS IN
O'KEEFE'S DRIVEWAY
RIGHT BEHIND HIS CAR,

03:37.785 --> 03:39.387
BLOCKING THE SIDEWALK?

03:39.420 --> 03:40.354
WHY DO YOU CARE?

03:40.388 --> 03:42.390
OK. WELL, IT'S--IT'S
RUDE AND IT'S
DANGEROUS.

03:42.423 --> 03:46.527
OK, BECAUSE IMAGINE
THERE'S AN OLD LADY
AND SHE'S ON HER RASCAL.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.296
AND SHE'S GOING
TO THE HIP DOCTOR.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.898
AND SHE'S, LIKE,
"OH, I JUST GOT TO
MAKE ONE MORE BLOCK.

03:50.931 --> 03:54.302
UH-OH. SOMETHING'S
IN MY WAY."

03:54.335 --> 03:56.404
FAYE'S CAR!

03:56.770 --> 03:59.340
OK, OK, LOOK
AT THIS, HUH

03:59.373 --> 04:01.642
SHE ATE ALL THE OLIVES.

04:01.675 --> 04:02.576
YOU HATE OLIVES!

04:02.610 --> 04:03.711
YOU PUT THOSE OUT THERE
TO GET RID OF THEM.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.646
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
SHE WAS GONNA EAT
ALL OF THEM.

04:05.679 --> 04:08.316
SEAN, THE LAST GIRL
EDDIE BROUGHT TO OUR HOUSE

04:08.349 --> 04:10.584
SET FIRE TO OUR PORCH
WITH HER PIPE.

04:10.618 --> 04:13.387
YOU CAN HANDLE
AN OLIVE-EATER.

04:13.421 --> 04:14.722
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:14.755 --> 04:17.391
OH, JIMMY'S OBSESSED
WITH THE GIRL NEXT DOOR.

04:17.425 --> 04:18.726
Jimmy:
THEY'RE IN THE DEN!

04:18.759 --> 04:20.794
COME ON. LET'S MOVE!

04:21.329 --> 04:23.263
PERV.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.550
HEY. LOOK, I KNOW WE SAID
WE WERE GOING TO WAIT
2 MORE WEEKS

04:42.583 --> 04:44.084
BEFORE TELLING PEOPLE
WE'RE PREGNANT,

04:44.117 --> 04:45.519
BUT I'M JUST
TOO EXCITED.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.488
MAYBE WE COULD START
TELLING PEOPLE NOW.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.990
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO WAIT?

04:50.023 --> 04:52.993
YOU DIDN'T TELL
ANYBODY, DID YOU?

04:53.026 --> 04:53.494
NO, NO!

04:53.527 --> 04:54.828
NO, I DIDN'T--NO.

04:54.862 --> 04:57.064
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
OBVIOUSLY EDDIE,

04:57.097 --> 04:58.999
BUT JUST ON THAT LEVEL.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.502
THE LEVEL
THAT IS YOUR BROTHER?

05:01.535 --> 05:02.770
YEAH, THOSE PEOPLE.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.473
THOSE PEOPLE?
YOU ONLY HAVE ONE BROTHER.

05:05.506 --> 05:09.477
OK, YOU KNOW, WE COULD GO
BACK AND FORTH ON THIS
FOR DAYS AND DAYS,

05:09.510 --> 05:12.045
BUT I REALLY HAVE
TO WRAP UP THIS CORD.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.548
WHY ARE THE AMPS OUT
ANYWAY?

05:14.582 --> 05:16.384
BABY, SECOND MONDAY
OF THE MONTH--

05:16.417 --> 05:18.352
GARAGE BAND MONDAY
AT THE RED BOOT.

05:18.386 --> 05:21.989
OH, YEAH. GARAGE BAND
MONDAY ROCKS!

05:22.990 --> 05:25.092
IT DOES ROCK.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.361
EVERYBODY LOVES GBM.

05:27.395 --> 05:29.797
OH, YES.
IT'S VERY POPULAR.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.137
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:37.170 --> 05:40.040
THOSE IDIOTS
ON THE STAGE--
THEY OWN THE PLACE.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.510
NO ONE'S WATCHING
THE TAPS!

05:42.543 --> 05:43.877
HA HA HA!

05:43.911 --> 05:45.779
HA HA.

05:48.015 --> 05:51.051
LOOK, I'M NOT EVEN
THAT INTO IT, OK?

05:51.084 --> 05:52.786
ALL RIGHT?
IT'S EDDIE'S THING.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.922
GARAGE BAND MONDAY...
HE LIVES FOR IT.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.223
IT'S EDDIE'S THING.
OH.

05:56.256 --> 06:01.094
THAT'S WHY YOU PLAYED
A 20-MINUTE GUITAR SOLO
AT EDDIE'S THING?

06:01.128 --> 06:03.030
HEY, EVERYBODY.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.032
WHOA, IT'S JOEY!

06:05.065 --> 06:06.534
WHAT A NICE SURPRISE.

06:06.567 --> 06:07.868
WHY IS IT A SURPRISE?

06:07.901 --> 06:09.603
WELL, I JUST--I
THOUGHT YOU 2 BROKE UP.

06:09.637 --> 06:11.705
I KNOW. I THOUGHT
WE BROKE UP, TOO,

06:11.739 --> 06:13.073
BUT LILY CAME
INTO MOCHA JOJO'S

06:13.106 --> 06:14.942
AND TOLD ME
WE DIDN'T, SO...

06:14.975 --> 06:15.809
ALL RIGHT!

06:15.843 --> 06:19.012
HEY, WHO WANTS COFFEE?

06:19.046 --> 06:20.047
OH, WOW!

06:20.080 --> 06:21.114
JOEY BROUGHT
COFFEE.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.516
I JUST SPENT
THE WHOLE MORNING

06:22.550 --> 06:24.452
ROASTING UP SOME
TANZANIAN PEABERRY.

06:24.485 --> 06:25.553
OH, MY GOD!

06:25.586 --> 06:28.756
OF ALL THE WORLD'S PEABERRIES,
TANZANIAN'S MY FAVORITE!

06:28.789 --> 06:30.123
YOU EVER HAD YEMENI?

06:30.157 --> 06:32.092
I WOULD RATHER
DRINK MY OWN URINE.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.127
I'M SO WITH YA!

06:34.161 --> 06:36.196
YOU NEVER HAD YEMENI
PEABERRY.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.064
DON'T YOU EVER TELL ME

06:37.097 --> 06:39.733
WHAT I HAVE OR HAVEN'T HAD,
YOUNG LADY.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.001
BY THE WAY,
CONGRATULATIONS.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.904
MR. FINNERTY TOLD ME
ABOUT THE NEW BABY.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.873
THANKS.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.642
YOU TOLD MOCHA JOEY?

06:48.676 --> 06:50.844
BABY, I WAS DOWN THERE
GETTING COFFEE,

06:50.878 --> 06:52.045
AND I ORDERED
A DECAF FOR YOU,

06:52.079 --> 06:54.582
AND SOMETHING LIKE THAT'S
NOT GONNA ESCAPE
A GUY LIKE HIM.

06:54.615 --> 06:58.719
COME ON. YOU JUST
TOLD A RANDOM
COFFEE GUY?

06:58.752 --> 07:00.454
HE'S NOT RANDOM.
HE'S MY BOYFRIEND.

07:00.488 --> 07:01.689
OH, GOD, YOU'VE KNOWN
HIM 2 WEEKS

07:01.722 --> 07:03.657
AND YOU'VE ALREADY
BROKEN UP WITH HIM
3 TIMES.

07:03.691 --> 07:07.227
WELL, THAT'S ONLY MADE
OUR RELATIONSHIP STRONGER.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.697
OH, COME ON, LILY.
WHAT?

07:09.730 --> 07:10.964
IT SEEMS TO ME

07:10.998 --> 07:13.200
THAT THE SECOND
YOU HEARD BRAD WAS SEEING
THAT GIRL NEXT DOOR,

07:13.233 --> 07:14.968
YOU SUDDENLY HAD A RENEWED
INTEREST IN JOEY.

07:15.002 --> 07:18.539
OK, FIRST OF ALL,
THERE IS SUCH A THING
AS A COINCIDENCE...

07:18.572 --> 07:19.540
AND SECOND,

07:19.573 --> 07:21.241
I WOULDN'T SAY
BRAD'S SEEING HER.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.143
THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER
3 NIGHTS THIS WEEK,

07:23.176 --> 07:26.480
ACCORDING
TO JIMMY'S JOURNAL.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.683
ALL RIGHT, SINCE
WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE,

07:29.717 --> 07:31.552
I'M GONNA CALL MY DAD.

07:31.585 --> 07:32.853
OH! OH...

07:32.886 --> 07:35.556
YOU TOLD MY DAD?

07:35.589 --> 07:36.757
YOU HATE MY DAD!

07:36.790 --> 07:38.992
BABY, HE CALLED,
AND WE DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO TALK ABOUT.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.562
WHY DIDN'T YOU TALK
ABOUT WHAT AN ASS YOU ARE?

07:41.595 --> 07:44.131
WE ALWAYS TALK
ABOUT THAT.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.801
OH, HEY, ED.
GLAD YOU'RE HERE,
MAN.

07:47.835 --> 07:50.638
I WORKED OUT
THE SOLO FOR
DETROIT ROCK CITY.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.073
I FIGURE I START...

07:53.106 --> 07:54.274
OH, YEAH. YOU GOT IT.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.375
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.945
HEY, LISTEN, I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
SOMETHING.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.213
I BEEN THINKING ABOUT
A LOT OF THINGS LATELY,

08:00.247 --> 08:03.817
AND I THINK
GARAGE BAND MONDAY
IS SORTA PLAYED OUT,

08:03.851 --> 08:06.920
LIKE IT'S KIND OF
RUN ITS COURSE.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.255
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

08:08.288 --> 08:10.157
I DON'T KNOW.
WE'VE BEEN DOING IT
FOR A WHILE.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.793
JUST SEEMS KIND OF JUVENILE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

08:12.826 --> 08:15.295
I'VE NEVER REALLY
SEEN IT AS...JUVENILE,

08:15.328 --> 08:18.532
BUT I GUESS
IF YOU PUT IT THAT WAY,

08:18.566 --> 08:19.933
I--AH--IT COULD BE.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.935
ARE YOU SURE? BECAUSE
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE
UPSET ABOUT THIS.

08:21.969 --> 08:25.138
HUH? OH, NO, MAN,
I'VE BEEN OVER
GARAGE BAND MONDAY

08:25.172 --> 08:26.874
FOR...
FOR A LONG TIME.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.610
I JUST FIGURED
IT WAS IMPORTANT
TO YOU,

08:29.643 --> 08:31.178
SO I JUST KEPT, UH...

08:31.211 --> 08:32.312
PLAYIN' ALONG.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.581
I JUST WANNA
TELL YOU NOW

08:33.614 --> 08:37.017
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT RENTING
A SMOKE MACHINE.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.152
THAT WAS JUST TALK,
YOU KNOW.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.822
IS THAT A SMOKE MACHINE?

08:42.255 --> 08:43.691
OH, THAT.
NO, THAT'S FOR, UM,

08:43.724 --> 08:45.793
YOU KNOW, CLAUDIA'S
DOCTOR JUST FIGURED

08:45.826 --> 08:49.597
THAT SHE SHOULD
BREATHE IN SMOKE.

08:50.263 --> 08:53.300
WE'RE GETTING
A NEW DOCTOR.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.616
* OOH, OOH

09:08.649 --> 09:10.651
* HOO, HOO

09:10.684 --> 09:13.353

09:16.123 --> 09:17.625
BRAD!

09:17.658 --> 09:19.092
HEY!

09:19.126 --> 09:20.327
I DIDN'T SEE YOU.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.930
I WAS JAMMIN'
TO MY TUNES.

09:22.963 --> 09:26.333
I GOT A NEW
SATELLITE RADIO.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.268
SO WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN UP TO?

09:28.301 --> 09:30.671
OH! I GUESS
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.073
I'VE BEEN SEEING JOEY.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.642
OH! GOOD FOR YOU.

09:34.675 --> 09:38.378
THANKS. YEAH. WE'RE,
LIKE, REALLY INTENSE,
YOU KNOW.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.280
WE'RE INTO EACH OTHER.

09:40.313 --> 09:41.348
YEAH?

09:41.381 --> 09:42.015
IT'S GREAT.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.984
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU
AND TAYA?

09:44.017 --> 09:46.086
WE'RE DEFINITELY
TOGETHER.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.187
HER FAMILY'S
REALLY COOL.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.623
WE HAD GAME NIGHT
THE OTHER NIGHT.
IT WAS REALLY FUN.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.324
WOW, THAT'S FUNNY!

09:51.358 --> 09:54.795
JOEY AND I,
WE PLAY GAMES ALL THE TIME.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.364
YEAH, IT'S LIKE
OUR THING!

09:57.397 --> 10:00.100
WE SHOULD PLAY GAMES
TOGETHER SOME TIME.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.969
I MEAN,
THE FOUR OF US.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.638
OH, ALL RIGHT. YEAH--

10:08.441 --> 10:10.744
OH, HEY, SEAN,
THAT WAS LENA.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.713
REALLY BIG NEWS.
GUESS WHAT.

10:12.746 --> 10:13.413
I'M PREGNANT!

10:13.446 --> 10:14.948
OH, OK.
I DIDN'T TELL HER.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.217
APPARENTLY SHE WAS
AT THE RED BOOT LAST NIGHT

10:17.250 --> 10:18.351
WHEN YOU ANNOUNCED IT.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.120
I DIDN'T SEE HER
THERE.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.288
I HAVE TO GO
TO SCHOOL NOW.

10:21.321 --> 10:24.357
SHOULD I EXPECT
MY FRENCH PROFESSOR
TO CONGRATULATE ME?

10:24.391 --> 10:27.127
I DON'T KNOW.
DOES HE TAKE THE FERRY?

10:27.160 --> 10:29.229
I'M JOKING, BABY.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.364
COME ON,
GIVE ME SOME CREDIT.

10:32.265 --> 10:35.168
HEY, CLAUDIA.
THESE WERE ON YOUR STOOP.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.336
OH, WOW!

10:36.369 --> 10:39.306
"CONGRATULATIONS
FROM...FATHER TIM."

10:39.339 --> 10:41.408
BABY, HE DIDN'T
GET IT FROM ME.

10:41.441 --> 10:44.945
HE GOT IT DIRECTLY
FROM GOD.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.446
HI, EDDIE.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.715
HEY.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.282
HEY, FAYE.
YOU FIND A SPOT OK?

10:49.316 --> 10:51.351
YEAH, I JUST PARKED IT
WHERE I ALWAYS DO.

10:51.384 --> 10:52.552
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

10:52.585 --> 10:55.422
THAT'S REAL CONVENIENT
HOW THAT'S ALWAYS JUST
SITTING THERE.

10:55.455 --> 10:59.192
LISTEN, WE CAN GO TO
THAT PARTY TOMORROW
NIGHT IF YOU WANT.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.294
BUT I THOUGHT YOU HAD
YOUR GARAGE BAND THING.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.396
WE'RE NOT GONNA
BE DOING THAT ANYMORE.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.365
YEAH, SEE,
ME AND EDDIE

11:05.398 --> 11:06.466
ARE KINDA OVER THAT

11:06.499 --> 11:08.268
EVEN THOUGH
IT WAS HIS THING.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.938
GOOD. I ALWAYS THOUGHT
IT WAS A LITTLE JUVENILE.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.740
OH! OH, YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS JUVENILE.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.441
THAT'S REALLY
INTERESTING, YOU SEE,

11:14.474 --> 11:17.377
BECAUSE I THOUGHT EDDIE
THOUGHT IT WAS JUVENILE.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.180
FAYE SAID IT,
BUT I AGREED WITH IT.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.149
OH, SO LOOKING BACK,
AT LEAST,
YOU COULD AGREE

11:22.182 --> 11:24.017
THAT YOU PROBABLY
SHOULD HAVE
REPHRASED IT

11:24.051 --> 11:26.353
SO I'D KNOW WHO
INITIALLY THOUGHT
IT WAS JUVENILE

11:26.386 --> 11:28.321
AND WHO SUBSEQUENTLY
CAME ON BOARD.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.257
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

11:30.290 --> 11:31.759
NONE, REALLY.
YOU KNOW, NOTHING,

11:31.792 --> 11:33.761
JUST AS LONG
AS WE'RE ON
THE SAME PAGE

11:33.794 --> 11:36.163
ABOUT THE JUVENILITY
OF GARAGE BAND MONDAY.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.132
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE TO GO TAKE
DOWN SOME FLIERS.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.968
YOU PUT UP FLIERS?

11:41.001 --> 11:42.435
JUST A FEW, YOU KNOW.

11:42.469 --> 11:45.472
NOT A JUVENILE AMOUNT.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.376
SEAN HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH ME?

11:49.409 --> 11:51.244
NO. HOW COULD HE?

11:52.179 --> 11:53.446
WHAT WAS THAT?

11:53.480 --> 11:55.082
MY CAR!

11:55.115 --> 11:59.719
IT'S OK.
IT'S JUST A DING.

12:02.089 --> 12:05.025
THANK GOD I'M NOT HURT!

12:07.560 --> 12:09.529
OOH! OK, THIS IS GOING
TO BE A TRICKY ONE.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.798
HI, TAYA.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.465
HEY.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.500
YOU LOOK TERRIFIC.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.334
THANKS.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.436
THAT SHIRT LOOKS GREAT
WITH THAT SKIRT.

12:16.469 --> 12:17.637
MUCH BETTER
THAN WITH JEANS.

12:17.670 --> 12:20.373
THAT'S SO FUNNY.
I WAS GOING TO WEAR IT
WITH JEANS TONIGHT.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.375
I JUST CHANGED
AT THE LAST SECOND.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.510
YEAH, I KNOW.

12:23.543 --> 12:24.945
YOU KNOW?

12:24.978 --> 12:25.779
NO. I--I...

12:25.813 --> 12:28.381
NO--LIKE I HEARD YOU.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.550
NOT LIKE I HEARD YOU
GET CHANGED.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.052
HOW--HOW COULD I--

12:32.085 --> 12:35.388
I DID 12 PULL-UPS
IN GYM TODAY.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.490
THEY GAVE ME
A FITNESS BADGE.

12:37.524 --> 12:40.193
I'M GONNA GO GET IT.

12:41.494 --> 12:45.065
OK. ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.333
IT'S A MOVIE.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.167
PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN:
CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL!

12:47.200 --> 12:50.203
DING, DING, DING,
DING, DING!
WHOO!

12:50.237 --> 12:51.939
HOW DID YOU GET THAT SO FAST?

12:51.972 --> 12:55.042
OH. WELL, MY FAMILY
HAS GAME NIGHT
EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT,

12:55.075 --> 12:57.410
AND BRAD WAS ON
MY TEAM LAST WEEK.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.879
WE JUST KNOW HOW
TO READ EACH OTHER'S SIGNALS.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.513
OH, AND YOU WERE GREAT
WITH MY MOM, TOO.

13:00.547 --> 13:01.982
SHE LOVES YOU.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.451
OH, YEAH. JOEY'S MOM
LOVES ME, TOO.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.419
MY MOM'S DEAD.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.421
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?

13:08.455 --> 13:10.590
KNOW? OF COURSE,
I KNEW IT.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.560
I WANTED HIM TO FEEL NORMAL.

13:13.593 --> 13:16.997
OK, LET'S PLAY
SOME MORE CHARADES!

13:17.030 --> 13:19.199
YOUR TURN, HONEY.

13:19.532 --> 13:22.169
OH. THIS IS EASY.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.203
OK.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.271
OK.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.172
OK, 2 WORDS.

13:25.205 --> 13:28.408
2 WORDS, 2 WORDS.
I GOT THAT IT'S 2 WORDS.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.510
WHAT IS IT?

13:30.543 --> 13:32.045
SOUNDS LIKE. SOUNDS LIKE?

13:32.079 --> 13:33.613
OK, SOUNDS LIKE WHAT?

13:33.646 --> 13:35.348
MOVIE.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.384
SOUNDS LIKE A MOVIE?

13:37.417 --> 13:39.252
POVIE!

13:39.519 --> 13:41.488
DOVIE? I DON'T UNDERSTAND!

13:41.521 --> 13:43.456
POSEIDON ADVENTURE!

13:44.191 --> 13:47.227
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY
WHAT IT IS.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.567
HERE YOU GO, SEAN,

13:54.601 --> 13:58.138
AN ESTIMATE FOR THE DAMAGE
TO FAYE'S CAR.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.907
1,100 BUCKS?!

13:59.940 --> 14:01.942
THAT'S WHAT THE DEALERSHIP'S
CHARGING.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.510
WHY'D YOU TAKE IT
TO A DEALERSHIP?

14:03.543 --> 14:04.544
YOU GOT ALL THESE GUYS.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.247
WHAT, YOU DON'T HAVE
A GUY WHO CAN
FIX A BUMPER?

14:07.280 --> 14:08.215
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.349
I'M NOT GOING TO ENTRUST IT
TO ONE OF MY GUYS.

14:09.382 --> 14:12.185
YOU OFFERED TO HAVE
ONE OF YOUR GUYS
DO MY TOE SURGERY.

14:12.219 --> 14:16.523
I DON'T WANT MY GIRLFRIEND'S
BUMPER TO GET INFECTED
AND FALL OFF.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.592
WELL, YOUR GIRLFRIEND
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
PARKING THERE.

14:19.626 --> 14:23.130
ALL RIGHT? I WAS BEING
VERY CAREFUL.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.148
IT'S CALLED A DRIVEWAY, OK,

14:41.181 --> 14:43.216
BECAUSE YOU DRIVE
ALL THE WAY INTO IT!

14:43.250 --> 14:45.986
SHE COULDN'T!
O'KEEFE WAS PARKED
IN FRONT OF HER!

14:46.019 --> 14:47.354
IT'S HIS DRIVEWAY!

14:47.387 --> 14:48.088
OH, HEY.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.522
SEAN, YOU KNOW
THAT HOMELESS GUY

14:49.556 --> 14:52.559
THAT HOLDS OPEN THE DOOR
FOR YOU AT THE ATM?

14:52.592 --> 14:56.229
ANY REASON HE'D SAY,
"CONGRATULATIONS,
MOMMY," TO ME?

14:56.263 --> 14:59.599
OK, I MIGHT HAVE TOLD HIM.

14:59.632 --> 15:00.633
JUST NO MORE, ALL RIGHT?

15:00.667 --> 15:01.701
I AM THE ONE
HAVING THIS BABY,

15:01.734 --> 15:03.003
AND BEFORE I ACTUALLY
GIVE BIRTH,

15:03.036 --> 15:06.706
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TELL
ONE PERSON ON THE PLANET
I'M HAVING IT.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.374
OK.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.375
I DON'T MEAN TO HARP
ON THIS,

15:08.408 --> 15:10.577
BUT IF I COULD JUST
GET A CHECK FOR THE DEPOSIT.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.212
DEPOSIT FOR WHAT?

15:12.245 --> 15:14.147
SEAN SMASHED UP
FAYE'S CAR.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.216
WHAT?
I DIDN'T SMASH IT,
I DINGED IT.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.485
A DING DOESN'T COST
1,100 BUCKS!

15:18.518 --> 15:20.053
YEAH, AT A DEALERSHIP
IT DOES!

15:20.087 --> 15:20.853
DID YOU DO IT ON PURPOSE?

15:20.887 --> 15:22.389
SHE WAS PARKED
INAPPROPRIATELY, BABY.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.190
DID YOU DO IT
ON PURPOSE?

15:23.223 --> 15:24.557
HER REAR-END WAS
IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.726
DID YOU DO IT ON PURPOSE?!

15:26.759 --> 15:28.962
SORT OF.

15:38.638 --> 15:39.439
JUVENILE.

15:39.472 --> 15:43.610
HOW'S THIS
FOR JUVENILE?!

15:46.313 --> 15:48.348
AH HA HA HA HA HA!

15:49.649 --> 15:50.984
OK, SO YOU'RE INSANE.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.719
LOOK, I DIDN'T
START OUT THAT WAY.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.721
I WAS DRIVEN INSANE
BY HIS GIRLFRIEND.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.756
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM
WITH FAYE?

15:56.789 --> 15:59.026
OH, LET'S SEE. SHE'S
OVERBEARING, ALL RIGHT?

15:59.059 --> 16:00.693
SHE'S PRETENTIOUS.
SHE'S A WITCH.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.629
HEY, COME ON,
SEAN.

16:02.662 --> 16:03.563
THAT IS NOT FAIR.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.165
NO, SERIOUSLY, BABY.
THE OTHER DAY SHE SAID,

16:05.198 --> 16:07.134
"BE CAREFUL, SEAN.
I'M A WITCH."

16:07.167 --> 16:08.035
YOU'RE TAKING THAT
OUT OF CONTEXT.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.470
SHE WENT THROUGH
A WITCH PHASE IN COLLEGE.

16:10.503 --> 16:14.007
EVERYBODY GOES THROUGH
A WITCH PHASE IN COLLEGE.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.142
RIGHT, CLAUDIA?

16:15.175 --> 16:20.380
UH, AGAIN, PART-TIME,
MARRIED, PREGNANT.
NO WITCHCRAFT.

16:20.413 --> 16:21.581
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:21.614 --> 16:22.782
I THINK YOU DON'T
LIKE FAYE BECAUSE
SHE HAS HER OWN IDEAS.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.685
NO, I DON'T LIKE FAYE
BECAUSE OF WHAT SHE'S
DOING TO YOU.

16:25.718 --> 16:26.519
SHE'S NOT DOING
ANYTHING TO ME.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.688
WHAT? SHES TAKING YOU
TO POETRY SLAMS

16:28.721 --> 16:29.756
AND WOMEN'S STUDY GROUPS.

16:29.789 --> 16:32.292
SHE'S TURNING ME ON
TO THINGS I DIDN'T
KNOW ABOUT.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.627
YEAH, WELL, SHE MADE YOU
CANCEL GARAGE BAND MONDAY.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.029
SHE DID NOT MAKE ME CANCEL.

16:36.063 --> 16:37.064
SHE SAID IT WAS JUVENILE.

16:37.097 --> 16:37.897
IT JUVENILE.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.766
I KNOW! THAT'S WHAT'S
SO FUN ABOUT IT!

16:39.799 --> 16:44.504
YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS THAT I DON'T MAKE
MY OWN DECISIONS,

16:44.537 --> 16:46.173
I CAN'T MAKE MY OWN CHOICES,
THAT SHE'S MAKING THEM FOR ME.

16:46.206 --> 16:49.709
YOU'RE NOT INSULTING FAYE.
GUESS WHAT? YOU'RE INSULTING ME.

16:49.742 --> 16:50.477
FINE, I'LL INSULT YOU.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.080
YOU HAVE TERRIBLE TASTE
IN WOMEN.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.715
IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE
THE FACT THAT I'M DATING

16:55.748 --> 16:58.251
A PART-TIME FEMINIST,
FORMER LESBIAN EX-WITCH,

16:58.285 --> 17:00.820
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S BEING
SMALL-MINDED.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.655
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT? FINE.
HAVE YOUR GIRLFRIEND!

17:02.689 --> 17:05.125
ALL RIGHT? SLAM ALL
THE POETRY YOU WANT!

17:05.158 --> 17:06.093
EXPAND YOUR HORIZONS.

17:06.126 --> 17:09.729
I DON'T NEED YOU TO HAVE
A JUVENILE GOOD TIME.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.198
OH, AND BY THE WAY,

17:11.231 --> 17:12.432
IF SHE'S SUCH A GREAT WITCH,

17:12.465 --> 17:14.701
WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE HER CAST A SPELL
ON THE FREAKIN' BUMPER?!

17:14.734 --> 17:18.371
THAT AIN'T
HOW WITCHCRAFT WORKS.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.140
HE'S JUST ANGRY.

17:20.173 --> 17:23.076
YOU LIKE FAYE, DON'T YOU?

17:23.110 --> 17:24.811
OF COURSE, I LIKE FAYE.

17:24.844 --> 17:27.547
I THINK HE WOULD, TOO,
UNDER DIFFERENT
CIRCUMSTANCES.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.249
WHAT, IF SHE WASN'T
MY GIRLFRIEND?

17:29.282 --> 17:30.517
YEAH, IF SHE WASN'T
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.285
I THINK HE THINKS
SHE TAKES YOU
AWAY FROM HIM.

17:32.319 --> 17:35.188
SO THE PARKING THING IS
NOT WHAT'S BOTHERING HIM?

17:35.222 --> 17:37.157
NO, HE'S A FREAK
ABOUT PARKING.

17:37.190 --> 17:40.059
I JUST THINK
HE MISSES YOU.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.595
UGH.

17:42.629 --> 17:45.265
WAY OF...MICE.
THE WAY OF MICE!

17:45.298 --> 17:47.600
THE WAY OF RICE!
YES! WHOA!

17:47.634 --> 17:48.701
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

17:48.735 --> 17:51.271
THERE'S NO SONG
THE WAY OF RICE.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.340
AND THE SCORE IS...

17:53.373 --> 17:55.175
9 TO 1! I KNOW.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.843
I'M GETTING
A LITTLE CHILLY.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.878
I'M GOING TO GO
GET MY SWEATER.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.147
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.314
YOU KNOW,
I SHOULD GET GOING.

18:01.348 --> 18:02.815
I'M WORKING THE LATE SHIFT
AT MOCHA JOJO'S.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.118
NO, NO, NO.
WE'RE JUST GETTING
A GROOVE GOING.

18:05.152 --> 18:07.387
OH, WELL,
I GET OFF AT 2:00.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.888
IF YOU WANT,
I CAN COME BACK.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.723
I MEAN, I USUALLY
STAY UP FOR HOURS.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.859
NO. THIS IS
A PRETTY MELLOW GAME.

18:12.892 --> 18:15.262
WE'RE GONNA PROBABLY
SHUT IT DOWN BY MIDNIGHT.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.830
OH, OK. WELL,
NICE MEETING EVERYONE.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.632
SEE YOU LATER, LILY.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.368
BYE, BABE.

18:23.270 --> 18:27.140
SO...JOEY SEEMS NICE.

18:27.174 --> 18:31.444
YEAH. YEAH, HE'S VERY NICE.

18:32.212 --> 18:36.716
LILY, CAN I--
CAN I BE HONEST?

18:36.749 --> 18:38.751
IS IT NECESSARY?

18:38.785 --> 18:39.719
YOU'RE--YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:39.752 --> 18:42.889
NO. I'M SORRY, GO AHEAD.

18:42.922 --> 18:47.294
WELL, IT'S JUST THAT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

18:47.327 --> 18:49.862
WHY YOU'RE WITH HIM.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.399
I DON'T WANT TO SAY
I'M JUDGMENTAL,

18:52.432 --> 18:55.235
BUT HE'S
KIND OF A FREAK.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.237
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.838
WHERE IS THIS COMING FORM?

18:58.871 --> 19:00.473
ARE YOU JEALOUS, MAYBE?

19:00.507 --> 19:01.841
NO, NO, DON'T--
LOOK, COME ON.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.543
HE'S OUT OF HIS
FREAKIN' MIND, LIL.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.545
HE CAN'T TALK ABOUT
ANYTHING BUT COFFEE.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.380
HE CAN'T SIT STILL
FOR 2 MINUTES.

19:07.414 --> 19:10.550
HE'S WRITING AN OPERA
ABOUT JUAN VALDEZ.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.752
OK, FINE, WELL,
HE HAS SOME QUIRKS,

19:12.785 --> 19:16.823
BUT AFTER A WHILE,
YOU DON'T EVEN
NOTICE THEM.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.658
I HOPE.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.428
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THIS IS THE GUY FOR YOU?

19:21.461 --> 19:23.930
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO, BRAD?

19:23.963 --> 19:26.866
YOU MOVED ON...
VERY QUICKLY.

19:26.899 --> 19:30.970
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE
THE ONE LEFT ALONE.

19:31.003 --> 19:31.804
IT'S SCARY.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.005
IT'S LIKE...

19:33.039 --> 19:34.907
WHEN YOU WERE 6
AND YOUR PARENTS LOST YOU
AT CONEY ISLAND.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.844
YES OR REMEMBER WHEN
YOUR...

19:37.877 --> 19:38.945
DOG CURLY RAN AWAY.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.112
I KNOW.
I WAS DEVASTATED,

19:40.146 --> 19:43.916
BUT I DIDN'T
RUN OUT AND SETTLE FOR
THE FIRST DOG I FOUND.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.652
I MEAN, DON'T YOU
WANT A ROMANCE LIKE...

19:45.685 --> 19:47.654
MOULIN ROUGE! YES!
YES!

19:47.687 --> 19:48.421
WHO DOESN'T, BUT...

19:48.455 --> 19:50.223
IT'S REALLY, REALLY HARD,
I KNOW.

19:50.257 --> 19:53.526
BUT I JUST THINK
YOU DESERVE SOMEONE WHO...

19:53.560 --> 19:55.762
I CAN CONNECT WITH
LIKE YOU...

19:55.795 --> 19:56.963
WITH TAYA!

19:56.996 --> 19:58.931
EXACTLY!

19:59.799 --> 20:00.967
EXACTLY.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.936
OH, HEY, YOU'RE TAYA
FROM NEXT DOOR, RIGHT?

20:03.970 --> 20:06.706
YEAH.
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO MY HUSBAND?

20:06.739 --> 20:08.475
NO.

20:08.975 --> 20:09.942
I'M PREGNANT.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.279
THAT'S FANTASTIC!

20:12.312 --> 20:13.846
I KNOW!

20:13.880 --> 20:14.681
WOW!

20:14.714 --> 20:17.850
ISN'T IT WONDERFUL?
