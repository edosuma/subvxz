WEBVTT

00:06.868 --> 00:09.704
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- No, I'm just saying.

00:09.788 --> 00:11.289
They do weird shit with Mrs. Butterworth.

00:11.372 --> 00:13.252
They shouldn't have shaped
her bottle like that.

00:15.835 --> 00:17.921
I hate to hear what you do to donuts.

00:21.883 --> 00:23.593
Well... there's Dad.

00:25.053 --> 00:27.346
Wonder how many cows
he inseminated today.

00:27.430 --> 00:28.973
Don't know. Don't care.

00:29.057 --> 00:30.975
He wants to take away
all the important jobs,

00:31.059 --> 00:32.435
treat me like a hired hand?

00:33.186 --> 00:35.438
I'm just gonna kick back,
get paid and drink beer.

00:35.522 --> 00:36.565
Hell yeah.

00:37.315 --> 00:39.859
Just like me when I
played for Florida State.

00:41.485 --> 00:42.612
I'd say, "We should go in there"

00:42.696 --> 00:44.322
and shave off his mustache
while he's asleep,"

00:44.405 --> 00:46.950
but it'd probably just grow
back before he wakes up.

00:48.910 --> 00:51.705
Look at him in there.
Washing dishes by hand.

00:51.788 --> 00:56.000
[imitating Beau] "Don't trust the
dishwasher to do a good enough job."

00:56.084 --> 00:58.628
Ain't got enough experience
washing dishes."

00:59.963 --> 01:01.130
We don't have a dishwasher.

01:03.507 --> 01:06.094
What the fuck have I been putting
all them dirty dishes in?

01:07.053 --> 01:09.263
I'm just kidding,
I know we ain't got one.

01:09.347 --> 01:11.390
Even if we did, he'd probably
curse out the Koreans

01:11.474 --> 01:15.519
for making the buttons too small
for his big, fat American fingers.

01:15.604 --> 01:17.856
Yeah. [Imitating Beau]
"What the hell is extra rinse?

01:17.939 --> 01:20.316
Why not just rinse 'em right
the first time, Kim Jong?"

01:20.399 --> 01:21.610
[Colt chuckles]

01:23.277 --> 01:25.029
Hey, you wanna head down to the bar?

01:25.113 --> 01:27.031
No, I gotta take a shower.

01:27.699 --> 01:29.408
Taking Abby out
on our first date tonight.

01:29.492 --> 01:31.285
- Ooh, all right.
- What are you doing?

01:31.369 --> 01:32.411
Going down to the bar.

01:32.495 --> 01:33.579
Depending on how the night goes,

01:33.663 --> 01:36.374
I'm either gonna hang out
with Mary or Mrs. Butterworth.

01:37.626 --> 01:39.711
And in a perfect world, both.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:49.428 --> 01:51.014
You put that snow fence back up?

01:51.097 --> 01:52.682
Oh, did you say "put it up"?

01:52.766 --> 01:54.726
We thought you said "fuck
it up," so we did that.

01:57.729 --> 02:00.148
Yeah, we also moved that feed
trough to where you wanted it.

02:00.231 --> 02:02.191
Did the whole job and did it correctly.

02:02.275 --> 02:04.736
Like responsible,
intelligent adults, so...

02:04.819 --> 02:06.070
[blows raspberry]

02:08.531 --> 02:12.410
I know you're still bent out of shape
about me taking over the insemination.

02:13.494 --> 02:15.496
It might make you feel
better if you just...

02:16.497 --> 02:17.957
get the fuck over it.

02:19.292 --> 02:20.710
[blows raspberry]

02:24.839 --> 02:26.841
Hey, remember how pissed Dad got

02:26.925 --> 02:30.011
when I put that Hillary bumper
sticker on his tractor?

02:31.262 --> 02:33.014
Well, now I'm gonna
put one on his coffin.

02:38.186 --> 02:41.022
Oh, Mrs. Butterworth. [Sighs]

02:42.356 --> 02:43.942
I'm sorry about my brother.

02:45.568 --> 02:47.946
Oh, God. I hope you're sticky from syrup.

- Here we go.

03:54.345 --> 03:56.848
- [Abby] Yeah, uh...
- You know where we are?

03:56.931 --> 03:58.141
Well, it smells good,

03:58.224 --> 04:00.226
so I'm guessing it's not your bedroom.

04:00.309 --> 04:01.685
[chuckles]

04:01.770 --> 04:03.437
Hey, I use Febreze.

04:03.521 --> 04:05.106
Yes, you do.

04:05.189 --> 04:06.816
By the way, it's not a body spray.

04:06.900 --> 04:07.942
Oh.

04:09.736 --> 04:11.487
Yeah, and Copenhagen
ain't a breath mint,

04:11.570 --> 04:12.822
but when you're in a jam,
you're in a jam.

04:12.906 --> 04:13.948
[laughs]

04:14.032 --> 04:15.408
[sighs] All right.

04:15.491 --> 04:17.285
- All right.
- Okay.

04:17.368 --> 04:18.411
Where do you think we are?

04:19.745 --> 04:21.579
- Hmm.
- Oh, this is awesome.

04:21.664 --> 04:23.624
- You're never gonna get it.
- Laundromat?

04:23.707 --> 04:24.918
Are you fucking kidding me?

04:25.001 --> 04:26.252
[laughing]

04:26.335 --> 04:27.378
Did you peek?

04:27.461 --> 04:28.504
Of course I peeked.

04:28.587 --> 04:30.714
I'm a woman in a blindfold
being put into a truck.

04:30.799 --> 04:32.050
[Colt chuckles]

04:32.884 --> 04:34.844
Well, it ain't just a Laundromat.

04:34.928 --> 04:36.595
This is a special place
from our history.

04:38.014 --> 04:41.559
Okay, a candlelit picnic in a Laundromat.

04:41.642 --> 04:43.812
I'm just gonna say this,
and I'm not mad...

04:44.312 --> 04:47.481
but I think this might be an inside joke
between you and a different girl.

04:48.024 --> 04:50.151
No, this is where we had our first date.

04:50.234 --> 04:52.821
No, it was at Rick's Arcade City.

04:53.571 --> 04:55.239
This is Rick's!

04:55.323 --> 04:56.783
Well, I mean, at least, it was.

04:56.866 --> 04:59.493
Rick had to sell it after that
incident with the Cub Scouts.

05:02.496 --> 05:04.165
Oh, my God!

05:04.248 --> 05:06.459
Yes, I forgot that they redid it.

05:06.542 --> 05:08.294
- [chuckles] Yeah.
- [sighs]

05:08.377 --> 05:10.088
- We played skee ball...
- Yeah.

05:10.171 --> 05:12.340
For hours until we'd get enough tickets

05:12.423 --> 05:15.093
to get one of those
crazy giant sunglasses.

05:15.176 --> 05:18.179
All right, you mean, uh... these?

05:18.262 --> 05:19.555
[gasps]

05:19.638 --> 05:21.224
- [chuckles]
- How did you get those?

05:21.307 --> 05:23.434
I bought 'em at the 99 cent store.

05:23.517 --> 05:24.768
[laughs] Oh, my God!

05:24.853 --> 05:27.333
Yeah, it turns out we could've
gone there all along. [Chuckles]

05:28.189 --> 05:31.150
Hey, uh, remember outside,
the go-kart track they had?

05:31.234 --> 05:34.445
Yeah, you put me into the wall
on turn three and I busted my lip.

05:35.113 --> 05:37.656
[chuckles] Whatever. Rubbin's Racin'.

05:38.950 --> 05:40.534
Remember you come around that last lap

05:40.618 --> 05:42.954
and passed me with a mouthful of blood?

05:44.580 --> 05:46.832
That's when I knew we were meant to be.

05:46.916 --> 05:48.251
[chuckles]

05:50.586 --> 05:52.005
How did you arrange all this?

05:52.964 --> 05:55.758
[smacks lips] Remember
Cooper Wynn, my tight end?

05:56.592 --> 05:58.970
Wait, was he the guy that
peed in the Gatorade bucket

05:59.053 --> 06:01.055
before dumping it on the coach's head?

06:02.932 --> 06:04.183
No, that was me.

06:05.851 --> 06:07.353
No, Cooper's the one I framed for it.

06:07.436 --> 06:08.729
[chuckles]

06:08.812 --> 06:10.398
He bought this place
with the money he got

06:10.481 --> 06:12.483
from the settlement
after the coach hit him.

06:14.193 --> 06:15.904
And he helped me set all this up.

06:17.030 --> 06:20.408
All right, Colt. This might be
the fumes from the bleach talking, but...

06:21.742 --> 06:22.785
this is so sweet.

06:25.454 --> 06:26.664
[Colt chuckles]

06:29.375 --> 06:31.460
Hmm, someone's excited.

06:31.544 --> 06:33.504
Oh... no. Just a roll of quarters.

06:33.587 --> 06:34.713
[chuckles]

06:36.049 --> 06:37.675
[smacks lips] You know...

06:37.758 --> 06:40.636
in case we get naked
and have to do some laundry.

06:40.719 --> 06:42.013
[chuckling]

06:52.315 --> 06:53.357
[Maggie sighs]

06:54.400 --> 06:55.693
- Hey, Rooster.
- Hey, Ma.

06:55.776 --> 06:58.446
What's the strongest thing
you got in this place?

06:58.529 --> 07:00.823
Oh, probably the oven cleaner.

07:03.451 --> 07:05.744
Great. Add some orange juice
and some grenadine.

07:05.828 --> 07:07.455
We'll call it a "Rooster sunrise."

07:08.957 --> 07:10.208
Make it two.

07:12.668 --> 07:14.545
All right, what'd your dad do?

07:14.628 --> 07:17.298
Well, he could have visited more.

07:18.716 --> 07:20.134
Not you, Hank.

07:20.759 --> 07:22.845
So, is the insemination not going well?

07:22.929 --> 07:24.763
Again, not you, Hank.

07:26.140 --> 07:27.350
I wouldn't know.

07:27.433 --> 07:29.593
He took the job away from us.
Decided to do it himself.

07:30.019 --> 07:31.895
- What? Why?
- Why?

07:31.980 --> 07:33.772
'Cause he thinks he's
the best at everything.

07:33.856 --> 07:35.816
It's like why he grabs the communion
out of the priest's hands.

07:35.899 --> 07:37.610
He's like, "No, no. I got this."

07:39.820 --> 07:43.157
Son of a bitch. I thought for
once he'd actually listen to me.

07:43.824 --> 07:45.952
Only way he's gonna listen
to you is if you said,

07:46.035 --> 07:47.661
"Ronald Reagan told me

07:47.745 --> 07:49.705
John Wayne said,
'Give them boys a shot.'"

07:52.250 --> 07:55.753
I can't believe it. It's shit like this
that's making me divorce your father.

07:55.836 --> 07:58.256
Yeah, trust me, I'm done with him, too.

07:58.339 --> 07:59.798
Wish there was a way
to get the fuck out of there.

07:59.882 --> 08:01.722
I just don't know
how or where to go, you know?

08:02.426 --> 08:05.346
It's like that Halloween
I woke up naked in a corn maze.

08:07.223 --> 08:09.683
I know you're frustrated,
but you're gonna figure something out.

08:09.767 --> 08:12.353
The Rooster I know
is ambitious and driven.

08:12.436 --> 08:15.189
You used to make and sell
your own beef jerky.

08:15.273 --> 08:16.524
Yeah. [Chuckles]

08:16.607 --> 08:18.776
That's what kept me alive
in that corn maze.

08:19.860 --> 08:22.071
You used to grow and sell your own weed.

08:22.155 --> 08:23.197
[chuckles]

08:23.281 --> 08:25.081
That's how I ended up naked
in that corn maze.

08:27.660 --> 08:28.911
The point is...

08:29.620 --> 08:31.039
you can't give up on yourself.

08:31.122 --> 08:33.124
There's a whole world of opportunities.

08:33.207 --> 08:34.917
Yeah, you're probably right.

08:35.001 --> 08:36.960
Hey, maybe I can come down
here and work with you?

08:37.044 --> 08:39.922
Oh, honey, I could never trust
you around all this alcohol.

08:43.759 --> 08:45.011
[Colt sighs]

08:46.554 --> 08:48.972
- [Colt chuckles]
- Mmm.

08:49.057 --> 08:50.724
Hmm, is it just me...

08:51.725 --> 08:54.020
or are we better at this than we
were in high school? [Chuckles]

08:54.103 --> 08:56.397
- [chuckles] Well, I know you are.
- Oh.

08:56.480 --> 08:59.108
- I've always been awesome.
- [chuckles]

08:59.692 --> 09:01.402
- Truth.
- Hmm.

09:02.820 --> 09:03.862
[kisses]

09:03.946 --> 09:05.781
Did you know we'd get back together?

09:06.282 --> 09:08.367
- Never had a doubt.
- Aw.

09:08.451 --> 09:11.370
What about you?
Think we'd get back together?

09:11.454 --> 09:12.538
No.

09:12.621 --> 09:14.998
And I promised, like,
six friends that I never would.

09:15.083 --> 09:16.250
[Colt chuckles]

09:16.334 --> 09:17.793
Fuck them bitches.

09:19.087 --> 09:20.421
[both chuckle]

09:20.504 --> 09:23.006
- I haven't even told them yet.
- Mmm.

09:29.930 --> 09:31.932
- You know, it's still early.
- Hmm.

09:32.015 --> 09:33.726
The rodeo in town. You wanna go?

09:33.809 --> 09:35.561
I'm not really a big fan.

09:35.644 --> 09:37.938
- What? Are you kidding?
- Mmm.

09:38.021 --> 09:40.023
They have beer, bulls, and burgers.

09:40.108 --> 09:42.360
Little kids chasing around greased pigs.

09:42.443 --> 09:44.528
You don't like that,
you don't like America.

09:45.279 --> 09:46.947
It's just the way they treat the animals.

09:47.906 --> 09:48.949
What?

09:49.032 --> 09:51.660
Roping 'em, and tying
'em up and riding 'em?

09:51.744 --> 09:53.496
Well, that's my plan for the weekend.

09:53.579 --> 09:55.081
[both chuckle]

09:56.957 --> 09:58.334
[Colt] Mmm.

09:58.417 --> 10:01.254
All right... you want to see a movie?

10:01.337 --> 10:03.589
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Great.

10:03.672 --> 10:06.175
Johnny Knoxville's got this new one out.

10:06.259 --> 10:08.219
[laughs] It looks so stupid.

10:08.302 --> 10:09.762
I can't wait to see it.

10:10.929 --> 10:13.224
Mmm, okay. Yeah, maybe.

10:13.307 --> 10:17.145
Or Alfonso Cuarón made a movie
about how there's no more music.

10:17.228 --> 10:19.480
Mmm, that sounds good.

10:19.563 --> 10:22.024
Does this Alfonso guy
shit in a tuba or something?

10:23.192 --> 10:24.818
No. No.

10:24.902 --> 10:28.322
It's a bleak portrait
of a dystopian society.

10:28.406 --> 10:29.448
Oh.

10:30.366 --> 10:31.409
Okay.

10:31.492 --> 10:33.452
Does... anyone get hit in the balls?

10:36.539 --> 10:37.915
You know what might be better?

10:37.998 --> 10:39.041
Anything.

10:39.875 --> 10:42.336
What if we just stay in
and entertain each other?

10:42.420 --> 10:43.462
Ooh.

10:44.380 --> 10:46.549
- I like that idea.
- Hmm.

10:46.632 --> 10:49.885
Well, maybe I should entertain you first.

10:49.968 --> 10:52.430
If it's the other way around,
I might fall asleep on your thigh again.

10:52.513 --> 10:54.014
[both chuckle]

10:58.144 --> 10:59.937
[vehicle approaching]

11:10.156 --> 11:12.450
What the fuck is your problem, Beau?

11:13.075 --> 11:14.910
Looks like one just rolled up.

11:16.495 --> 11:18.706
Those boys wanted
to prove themselves to you,

11:18.789 --> 11:20.708
and you wouldn't even let them.

11:20.791 --> 11:24.086
I should've known they'd go down
to the bar and cry to you about it.

11:24.169 --> 11:26.088
That's not what happened.

11:26.171 --> 11:28.466
They went down to the bar because...

11:28.549 --> 11:29.967
they drink too much.

11:31.219 --> 11:34.347
And then we bonded over the fact
that you're such an asshole.

11:35.348 --> 11:38.976
You looked me right in the eye
and told me you'd give them a shot.

11:39.059 --> 11:40.603
They had their shot.

11:41.687 --> 11:44.565
And after you and I talked,
I was gonna give them another one.

11:45.649 --> 11:48.527
Then, later that night,
I heard them arguing

11:48.611 --> 11:51.572
about which pet would be
the "most awesomest,"

11:52.490 --> 11:55.493
the cheetah-bear or the shark-dog.

11:56.869 --> 11:59.580
I started thinking about this last year.

12:00.623 --> 12:02.833
How it got so bad we needed a bank loan.

12:02.916 --> 12:04.502
Couldn't even get it approved.

12:06.545 --> 12:08.797
I'm not gonna risk
going through that again.

12:08.881 --> 12:10.674
None of that was their fault.

12:11.174 --> 12:14.428
I need to pay attention
to things here that I can control.

12:16.138 --> 12:18.391
Maybe they had bad luck.

12:19.267 --> 12:21.810
Maybe they were doing
it wrong. I don't know.

12:21.894 --> 12:25.523
But I do know, if I do the job,
it'll get done right.

12:25.606 --> 12:27.816
I thought you might have a good reason.

12:27.900 --> 12:30.278
But it turns out it's just
more of the same shit.

12:30.361 --> 12:33.281
Keeping this place running isn't
good enough a reason for you?

12:33.364 --> 12:35.032
You have a thousand excuses.

12:35.115 --> 12:37.701
"The boys aren't ready, maybe next year...

12:37.785 --> 12:40.120
Rooster's beard spooks the heifers."

12:41.330 --> 12:44.750
As far as you're concerned,
everyone but you is an idiot.

12:44.833 --> 12:46.710
Well, I can't argue with that.

12:47.711 --> 12:49.838
Well, I didn't come here to argue.

12:49.922 --> 12:52.049
I came here to tell you, I'm done.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.844
I'm sick of waiting for you to change.
You won't change for me,

12:55.928 --> 12:57.971
and you're not gonna
change for those boys.

12:58.055 --> 12:59.932
Fine. Here.

13:00.015 --> 13:02.643
It's the divorce papers
and I already signed them.

13:04.395 --> 13:08.732
I threw in a few contingencies
that I'm sure you'll hate,

13:08.816 --> 13:10.401
which makes me feel better.

13:12.445 --> 13:13.487
You know...

13:14.405 --> 13:16.365
one day you're going to
finish up in the pasture

13:16.449 --> 13:20.035
and come back to this porch
and realize you are all by yourself.

13:20.578 --> 13:21.620
Sounds good.

13:21.704 --> 13:23.497
Where do I sign up for that?

13:26.750 --> 13:28.168
[engine starting]

13:30.421 --> 13:33.298
[laughs] Okay, that was a lot of fun.

13:33.382 --> 13:35.634
But the next time you want
me to change positions,

13:35.718 --> 13:37.970
you can't just yell out, "Omaha, Omaha!"

13:41.223 --> 13:42.725
Hey, you turned and caught it.

13:45.185 --> 13:47.312
[chuckles] Well, I gotta call a time out,

13:47.396 --> 13:48.647
'cause I got work to do.

13:48.731 --> 13:49.940
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:50.023 --> 13:51.191
What you got to do?

13:51.274 --> 13:53.611
I am subbing for an
English class this week

13:53.694 --> 13:55.738
and they're reading
<i>A Tale of Two Cities.</i>

13:55.821 --> 13:57.948
I haven't read it in years,
so I need to brush up.

13:58.031 --> 13:59.324
- All right.
- [sighs]

13:59.408 --> 14:00.826
Listen, you do...

14:01.744 --> 14:02.828
whatever you got to do.

14:02.911 --> 14:05.539
- [chuckles]
- I just wanna hang out with you. So...

14:05.623 --> 14:08.709
- Oh, that's sweet. Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

14:10.419 --> 14:11.670
[sighs]

14:18.552 --> 14:20.012
What are you doing?

14:20.804 --> 14:22.431
Nothing.

14:22.515 --> 14:23.724
Just hanging out.

14:23.807 --> 14:25.934
[chuckling] No, you're watching me read.

14:26.018 --> 14:27.102
Hey, you're good at it, too.

14:27.185 --> 14:28.937
You ain't moving your lips or nothing.

14:29.021 --> 14:30.105
[chuckles]

14:32.065 --> 14:33.609
Okay, you know what?

14:34.610 --> 14:35.653
You read,

14:35.736 --> 14:37.696
I'll just watch TV or
something. How about that?

14:37.780 --> 14:39.197
I don't have a TV.

14:40.408 --> 14:41.450
What?

14:41.534 --> 14:42.618
I don't have a TV.

14:42.701 --> 14:43.744
Oh.

14:44.995 --> 14:46.038
Were you robbed?

14:47.498 --> 14:50.167
No. I just... never watched

14:50.250 --> 14:52.090
and it was taking up space,
so I got rid of it.

14:52.961 --> 14:55.801
Okay, I know what all them words
mean separately, but that... [chuckles]

14:57.007 --> 14:59.217
Okay, fine. You know what,
you're reading...

14:59.301 --> 15:01.387
uh... I'll read something, too.

15:01.470 --> 15:03.389
Omaha! Omaha!

15:03.472 --> 15:05.391
What, you don't think I read?

15:05.474 --> 15:07.309
I think you <i>can</i> read.

15:07.393 --> 15:09.853
Oh, come on. I love reading.
It's fundamental.

15:11.104 --> 15:13.190
- All right, what you got here?
- [chuckles]

15:13.273 --> 15:14.650
<i>Three Musketeers.</i>

15:14.733 --> 15:17.110
Why would they write a book
about a candy bar?

15:18.195 --> 15:19.572
What?

15:19.655 --> 15:21.156
No, I'm kidding. [Chuckles]

15:21.239 --> 15:23.409
I know it's based on a movie.

15:24.117 --> 15:27.621
Or we could, uh, just have sex
and I could read this later.

15:27.705 --> 15:30.583
No, come on. This is something
we could do together.

15:30.666 --> 15:32.167
It'll be fun.

15:33.293 --> 15:34.336
Okay, sure, um...

15:34.420 --> 15:35.963
I have another copy of
<i>A Tale of Two Cities.</i>

15:36.046 --> 15:38.340
There... perfect.

15:38.424 --> 15:39.842
Here you go. [Clears throat]

15:40.551 --> 15:42.511
Oh, that...

15:42.594 --> 15:45.055
Maybe we should start with <i>A
Tale of One City.</i> [chuckles]

15:47.182 --> 15:48.976
Colt, seriously,
you don't have to do this.

15:50.310 --> 15:51.895
- It'll be fun.
- [chuckles]

15:52.813 --> 15:54.565
- Oh.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

15:54.648 --> 15:57.443
- All right, here we go.
- All right, here we go.

15:57.526 --> 15:59.695
[reading] "To my dear wife, Catherine."

15:59.778 --> 16:01.989
- [scoffs] That was easy.
- [both chuckle]

16:02.072 --> 16:03.824
See? It's fun.

16:03.907 --> 16:05.951
All right, next. [Sighs]

16:07.077 --> 16:11.457
"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times."

16:13.584 --> 16:15.586
What the fuck does that mean?

16:22.092 --> 16:24.011
Oh, shit, is there a spider?

16:24.636 --> 16:25.554
What?

16:25.638 --> 16:27.014
No.

16:27.097 --> 16:28.181
Why you holding that book?

16:28.932 --> 16:30.058
I'm reading it.

16:31.268 --> 16:32.352
Why? Is the TV broke?

16:33.479 --> 16:35.523
No, man, I love to read.

16:35.606 --> 16:36.690
Since when?

16:36.774 --> 16:39.614
You have a meltdown if the menu
doesn't have pictures of the food on it.

16:39.902 --> 16:42.738
[sighing] I'm doing it for Abby.

16:42.821 --> 16:45.407
We're both reading it.
And I gotta tell you, it sucks.

16:45.491 --> 16:46.700
At least for me.

16:46.784 --> 16:48.786
She's sitting there,
smiling, flipping pages,

16:48.869 --> 16:50.871
making notes, which I totally don't get.

16:50.954 --> 16:53.666
Unless she's writing a suicide note
'cause she's forced to read this shit.

16:53.749 --> 16:55.333
[chuckles]

16:55.417 --> 16:56.794
Meanwhile, all I'm doing
is sitting there thinking,

16:56.877 --> 16:59.638
"I wonder if this guy got made fun of
'cause his last name's Dickens."

17:00.839 --> 17:03.258
"Hey, Charles, what'd you
stick your Dick-ins?"

17:03.341 --> 17:04.885
[chuckles] That's a good one.

17:04.968 --> 17:07.470
Hey, you know how they say, uh,
"You got your face in a book?"

17:07.555 --> 17:09.138
Well, you got a Dick-ins your face.

17:11.559 --> 17:13.476
- So then, why are you reading it?
- Oh.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.186
- Abby loves to read.
- Mmm.

17:15.270 --> 17:16.396
I thought it was something
we could do together.

17:16.479 --> 17:18.106
You know she don't even own a TV?

17:19.398 --> 17:20.733
That is fucked up.

17:22.528 --> 17:24.696
I don't know. It got me
to thinking, like...

17:24.780 --> 17:26.699
how much do we actually have in common?

17:26.781 --> 17:28.951
I mean, we can't
just have sex all the time.

17:29.034 --> 17:31.704
What the hell's wrong with you?
That book put that in your head?

17:34.748 --> 17:35.791
Yeah.

17:37.042 --> 17:38.126
Howdy, boys.

17:38.877 --> 17:40.588
- Hey, Dale. What's the good word?
- Hey, Dale.

17:40.671 --> 17:43.465
I've been regular
for three days straight.

17:45.342 --> 17:48.804
Okay, I meant more of, like,
"Why are you here?" But that's cool, too.

17:48.887 --> 17:51.765
Well, I dropped in
to check on that bunch of heifers,

17:51.849 --> 17:54.517
and your dad made
five out of eight pregnant.

17:55.352 --> 17:57.187
- Well, good for you.
- Awesome.

17:57.270 --> 17:59.648
It's not about me, it's about all of us.

17:59.732 --> 18:00.858
About the ranch.

18:00.941 --> 18:02.985
Yeah, okay. Whatever you say.

18:03.068 --> 18:05.028
Well, I'm gonna swing by Mary's
on the way to the bar.

18:05.112 --> 18:06.154
See you guys later.

18:06.238 --> 18:07.865
I'm going to Abby's. See you, Dale.

18:07.948 --> 18:09.950
Dale, good luck on day four.

18:13.871 --> 18:15.706
What the hell's wrong with them?

18:15.789 --> 18:19.292
They're mad 'cause I was right
about taking this job away from them.

18:20.377 --> 18:22.295
They don't see the bigger picture.

18:23.631 --> 18:25.716
You got time to stay for a whiskey?

18:25.799 --> 18:26.925
No, can't do it.

18:27.009 --> 18:29.219
Charlene and I got a movie night.

18:29.302 --> 18:30.846
Which reminds me...

18:32.180 --> 18:35.433
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I'm turning these hearing aids down.

18:36.018 --> 18:38.687
Charlene always picks them
romantic comedies.

18:38.771 --> 18:42.107
This way, I can pretend the
characters are talking about fishing.

18:47.780 --> 18:48.864
[door closes]

18:48.947 --> 18:50.866
Colt, what are you doing?

18:50.949 --> 18:53.994
[chuckles] Hey, surprise!
I got you a TV.

18:54.077 --> 18:56.288
Now we can binge watch
<i>Ice Road Truckers.</i>

18:56.371 --> 18:57.706
What?

18:57.790 --> 19:00.583
Oh, it's from the producers of <i>Ax
Men</i> and <i>Deadliest Catch.</i>

19:01.418 --> 19:04.963
I mean, I know what all those
words mean separately, but...

19:05.588 --> 19:06.757
Well, I just... I figured,

19:06.840 --> 19:10.343
if we were reading books together,
something you like to do...

19:10.427 --> 19:12.763
we could do something I like to do.
Hence, the TV.

19:12.846 --> 19:13.972
- Hence?
- Yeah.

19:14.056 --> 19:16.350
I read it in that
<i>Tale of a Couple Cities.</i>

19:17.643 --> 19:19.853
Hence, the use of "hence." [chuckles]

19:20.437 --> 19:21.479
Colt...

19:22.731 --> 19:24.107
'Twas a bad idea?

19:25.859 --> 19:28.737
I... I wanna do things with you, too.
But...

19:30.113 --> 19:31.823
I really don't want a TV.

19:31.907 --> 19:32.950
Oh.

19:34.117 --> 19:36.119
Okay. [Stammers]

19:37.037 --> 19:38.121
What are we gonna do?

19:39.164 --> 19:43.418
'Cause you don't wanna go to the rodeo,
and we can't agree on a movie.

19:43.501 --> 19:44.753
Now, I tried to read that book,

19:44.837 --> 19:47.005
and I gotta tell you,
it 'twas the worst of times.

19:49.132 --> 19:50.759
I never asked you to read it.

19:50.843 --> 19:52.427
I mean, where is this coming from?

19:52.928 --> 19:54.262
I don't know. Uh...

19:55.180 --> 19:57.099
You know,
I'm a guy who gets off of work,

19:57.182 --> 19:59.434
and comes home,
and cracks a beer and watches TV.

19:59.517 --> 20:00.518
Yeah.

20:00.602 --> 20:02.896
Yeah, and you're a teacher,
who gets off of work,

20:02.980 --> 20:05.148
and has a glass of white wine
and reads Dickens.

20:05.941 --> 20:08.318
And see, and the fact that you
don't laugh when I say "Dick-ins"

20:08.401 --> 20:10.112
just means we're total opposites.

20:10.988 --> 20:13.824
Oh, please. I mean, I've heard
every Dickens joke there is.

20:13.907 --> 20:16.869
Wait until we get to Longfellow,
or <i>Moby Dick.</i>

20:18.829 --> 20:20.330
It's about a giant sperm whale.

20:20.413 --> 20:22.457
All right, now you're
just fucking with me.

20:24.376 --> 20:26.962
Look, I'm just...
I'm afraid that me being me

20:27.045 --> 20:28.421
ain't gonna mix with you being you,

20:28.505 --> 20:30.090
and then you're just
gonna get bored of me.

20:30.173 --> 20:31.800
Why would I get bored with you?

20:31.884 --> 20:34.762
'Cause we got nothing in common.
Except for great sex.

20:34.845 --> 20:36.889
Oh, Colt, that is not true.

20:36.972 --> 20:39.767
I mean, I'm interested
in more than just sex with you.

20:40.558 --> 20:42.227
[chuckles] I mean, you make me laugh.

20:43.020 --> 20:44.187
You're spontaneous.

20:44.271 --> 20:46.732
I mean, that Laundromat thing
was so sweet.

20:46.815 --> 20:48.984
And no one's ever done
anything like that for me.

20:49.067 --> 20:51.694
So we have different interests.

20:51.779 --> 20:53.030
I mean, who cares?

20:53.947 --> 20:56.574
We're a dichotomy, but we're symbiotic.

20:57.409 --> 21:00.412
Okay, them words, I don't even know
what they mean separately. [Chuckles]

21:02.289 --> 21:03.623
Point is, it's okay.

21:03.706 --> 21:06.001
I mean, I can teach you big words

21:06.084 --> 21:07.085
- and...
- [chuckles]

21:07.169 --> 21:09.504
You can teach me who the weak side
linebacker is for the Broncos.

21:09.587 --> 21:11.214
[chuckles] I'm kidding,
it's DeMarcus Ware,

21:11.298 --> 21:12.632
but that's not the point.

21:14.176 --> 21:16.219
You don't have to put
so much pressure on yourself.

21:16.303 --> 21:19.347
I don't care if you ever read a book
for the rest of your life.

21:20.682 --> 21:23.268
That is the greatest gift
you could ever possibly give me.

21:23.351 --> 21:24.519
[chuckles]

21:25.228 --> 21:28.106
I just don't want you to blow up
your whole life to be with me,

21:28.190 --> 21:32.027
and then realize you made, like, a...
[grunts] big mistake.

21:32.110 --> 21:33.111
Okay.

21:34.029 --> 21:35.322
It's not a mistake.

21:36.198 --> 21:37.324
You're the one for me.

21:41.578 --> 21:43.496
And you can keep the TV.

21:43.580 --> 21:45.040
You can put it in the guest room
or something.

21:45.123 --> 21:47.209
You can watch your <i>Deadliest Ax Man.</i>

21:48.585 --> 21:51.254
That... that ain't a show.

21:51.338 --> 21:53.423
But if it was,
I'd binge watch the shit out of it.

22:03.266 --> 22:04.434
Hey, Joanne.

22:04.517 --> 22:05.768
Hey, Beau.

22:05.853 --> 22:07.395
Smells like something's burning.

22:07.479 --> 22:09.689
Yeah, that must be
your Chevy's transmission.

22:09.772 --> 22:11.358
- [chuckles]
- Come on in.

22:13.651 --> 22:14.987
Can I get you a drink?

22:15.070 --> 22:17.364
Well, I wouldn't mind a glass of wine.

22:17.447 --> 22:19.366
- Whiskey it is.
- [chuckles]

22:23.495 --> 22:26.164
I gotta say, I'm surprised you called.

22:27.165 --> 22:29.292
Truth be told, I misdialed.

22:30.961 --> 22:34.214
Damn Koreans make
those cell phone buttons too small.

22:37.717 --> 22:39.970
You really know how to make
a girl feel special.

22:41.429 --> 22:42.890
Where's Colt and Rooster?

22:42.973 --> 22:44.766
Far away from me as they can get.

22:44.849 --> 22:47.269
- I thought about going there. [Chuckles]
- Yeah.

22:48.811 --> 22:49.938
Why'd they go?

22:51.023 --> 22:53.358
Well, I told them
they could inseminate the herd,

22:53.441 --> 22:55.402
- and then I took it away from 'em.
- Oh.

22:55.485 --> 22:57.654
Now, they won't stop whining about it.

22:58.571 --> 23:00.157
They ought to be grateful.

23:00.240 --> 23:02.575
I've given them more
than anybody ever gave me.

23:02.659 --> 23:03.743
Oh, yeah?

23:05.162 --> 23:07.956
You, uh, buy this ranch yourself, did ya?

23:09.291 --> 23:10.333
All right.

23:11.251 --> 23:13.921
I can probably rustle you up a to-go box.

23:17.340 --> 23:18.883
Did you know I have a daughter?

23:19.592 --> 23:21.428
I don't think you've ever mentioned her.

23:22.845 --> 23:24.847
And if Colt and Rooster are around...

23:25.557 --> 23:27.850
- you should never mention her.
- [chuckles]

23:29.436 --> 23:30.687
When she was in her 20s,

23:30.770 --> 23:33.815
she was dating this guy
who was a real piece of work.

23:33.898 --> 23:36.443
He was in a Meat Loaf cover band.

23:37.402 --> 23:40.072
He was the drummer.
He wasn't even Meat Loaf.

23:42.740 --> 23:45.285
They used to stay out
all hours drinking,

23:45.368 --> 23:47.996
doing God knows what else.

23:48.997 --> 23:50.665
And then, one day,
she threatened to elope.

23:50.748 --> 23:53.543
And I told her that guy
was nothing but trouble

23:53.626 --> 23:55.128
and if she married that deadbeat

23:55.212 --> 23:57.714
she would never be welcome
in my house again.

23:59.132 --> 24:01.468
So she did and she wasn't.

24:03.178 --> 24:05.097
Yeah, sometimes they don't listen.

24:05.180 --> 24:07.975
Three years later,
she divorced his cheating ass.

24:08.933 --> 24:11.478
Who fucks the drummer
in a Meat Loaf cover band?

24:19.152 --> 24:20.237
So, you were right.

24:20.320 --> 24:23.448
Yeah, but our relationship
never recovered.

24:24.949 --> 24:28.620
I crossed a line with her
and she still hasn't forgiven me.

24:29.496 --> 24:30.872
Yeah, that's too bad.

24:31.873 --> 24:34.417
But, still, it's on her.

24:35.043 --> 24:36.461
[sighs]

24:36.544 --> 24:38.380
I also have a granddaughter.

24:39.506 --> 24:40.923
She just turned six.

24:41.883 --> 24:43.301
Her name's Nicole.

24:43.385 --> 24:44.927
Well, that's great.

24:46.888 --> 24:48.098
I've never met her.

24:50.058 --> 24:51.101
So...

24:51.934 --> 24:54.687
sometimes, being right
isn't the most important thing.

24:58.150 --> 24:59.484
I appreciate that.

25:04.072 --> 25:05.698
Thanks, Joanne.

25:05.782 --> 25:07.450
Well, I hope it helps.

25:08.826 --> 25:12.164
'Cause I know,
underneath all that anger and mustache,

25:12.247 --> 25:13.498
there's a heart in there.

25:15.083 --> 25:16.376
That what you think?

25:16.459 --> 25:19.171
Well, you wouldn't have
invited me over if there wasn't.

25:20.505 --> 25:23.091
What can I say? I enjoy your company.

25:23.175 --> 25:25.843
- [chuckles]
- You're welcome here anytime.

25:25.927 --> 25:27.137
Thanks.

25:28.888 --> 25:32.434
Suppose this would be a bad time
to tell you we're having meat loaf.

25:39.191 --> 25:40.650
- I'm just kidding.
- [chuckles]

25:40.733 --> 25:42.110
I'm gonna go put the steaks on.

25:42.194 --> 25:44.404
I like mine with A1 sauce.

25:45.613 --> 25:47.449
- Get out of here.
- [laughs]

25:52.745 --> 25:54.789
[shivers] Hey.

25:54.872 --> 25:57.041
Oh, good. You got my text.

25:58.168 --> 25:59.294
Uh...

26:01.254 --> 26:03.465
Yes. I am not just here to drink.

26:04.382 --> 26:05.425
What's up?

26:05.508 --> 26:06.551
- So, listen...
- [sighs]

26:06.634 --> 26:08.720
I know things have been getting worse
and worse with your dad.

26:08.803 --> 26:11.181
So, I called Ed Bishop.

26:12.724 --> 26:13.766
[Rooster] Okay.

26:13.850 --> 26:15.310
Why do I want to talk to Ed Bishop?

26:15.393 --> 26:18.980
Because he may say
something you want to hear.

26:19.814 --> 26:20.940
- Like what?
- Well...

26:21.023 --> 26:23.776
[sighs] for starters, he'll probably say,
"Drinks are on me."

26:25.320 --> 26:26.529
I'll talk to Ed.

26:28.740 --> 26:31.326
All right, I'll see what he's got to say.

26:31.409 --> 26:32.702
Make it two beers, please.

26:36.623 --> 26:38.333
One of these is for Ed, right?

26:39.751 --> 26:41.253
Uh, three beers, please.

26:43.838 --> 26:45.507
[exhales heavily] Hey, Ed.

26:45.590 --> 26:46.758
Hi, Rooster.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.261
Still screwing them cows?

26:49.344 --> 26:50.720
[chuckles] I thought it was sheep.

26:50.803 --> 26:52.597
[chuckles] So, you admit it.

26:52.680 --> 26:53.931
[chuckles]

26:55.183 --> 26:57.519
[sighing] So... what's new?

26:57.602 --> 27:00.605
Been spending all my time
at the old McConnell ranch.

27:00.688 --> 27:02.732
Some Hollywood dipshit bought it.

27:02.815 --> 27:04.734
Let his eight-year-old rename it.

27:04.817 --> 27:07.154
Now it's... [imitates child]
"My Little Pony Ranch."

27:08.321 --> 27:09.656
[chuckles]

27:09.739 --> 27:12.033
That's pretty badass
for an eight-year-old.

27:12.116 --> 27:14.827
The guy doesn't know
the first thing about ranching.

27:14.911 --> 27:17.705
Called his tractor "the diggin' thingy."

27:17.789 --> 27:18.956
[Rooster laughs]

27:19.416 --> 27:21.918
Must be the same guy
I ran into at the feed shop.

27:22.001 --> 27:23.753
He asked me where the, uh,

27:23.836 --> 27:25.963
closest charging station was
for his Tesla.

27:26.047 --> 27:27.382
[chuckles] What'd you tell him?

27:27.465 --> 27:29.133
- California.
- [chuckles]

27:30.427 --> 27:34.347
Unfortunately, that wannabe cowboy
is my responsibility.

27:34.431 --> 27:36.641
He's overgrazing his land.

27:36.724 --> 27:39.227
And he's not even
cross-checking his breeds.

27:39.311 --> 27:40.812
Hmm.

27:40.895 --> 27:42.855
Well, he's just gotta move
the cows around, you know,

27:42.939 --> 27:45.275
turn the ground over, re-seed it.

27:45.358 --> 27:48.320
Then he should sell some of them heifers
and bring in some new bulls.

27:48.403 --> 27:50.405
See, that's what we need.

27:50.488 --> 27:51.823
Someone like you

27:51.906 --> 27:54.576
who knows what they're talking about.

27:54.659 --> 27:56.494
What do you say to working for us?

27:57.579 --> 27:58.621
You serious?

27:58.705 --> 28:01.791
You're a great rancher, Rooster.
Always have been.

28:01.874 --> 28:03.835
If your daddy can't see it,
that's on him.

28:03.918 --> 28:05.212
We'd love to have you.

28:06.003 --> 28:08.548
The ranch is already staffed up.

28:08.631 --> 28:10.800
You'd be in charge
of the whole operation.

28:13.553 --> 28:14.596
Whoa.

28:14.679 --> 28:18.057
Oh, I'm... I'm not trying
to get in between you and your dad.

28:18.140 --> 28:20.268
I'm sorry if I overstepped my bounds.

28:20.352 --> 28:23.230
No, I...
I wanna keep talking about this.

28:23.313 --> 28:25.398
Let me go grab a couple whiskeys.

28:25.482 --> 28:27.695
You want something, too?

28:30.362 --> 28:32.364
