<i>And remember to join us this weekend</i>

00:31.745 --> 00:33.269
<i>for the Polish
Heritage Festival</i>

00:33.314 --> 00:35.179
<i>featuring a battle
of the polka bands</i>

00:35.216 --> 00:36.911

Civic Center.</i>

00:36.951 --> 00:39.010
<i>And after that, join us
for the pierogi eating--</i>

02:16.016 --> 02:18.143
- Stef.
- Hey.

02:18.185 --> 02:20.779
We missed you
at dinner last night.

02:20.821 --> 02:22.721
- Pam made pierogies.
- I was tired.

02:26.126 --> 02:27.991
I bet.

02:28.028 --> 02:29.859
You doing all right, Frank?
How's your mood?

02:31.365 --> 02:32.992
I'm fine.

02:34.501 --> 02:36.128
Yeah, you know,
I've been reading

02:36.170 --> 02:38.331
about that Seasonal
Affective Disorder.

02:38.372 --> 02:39.930
So?

02:40.974 --> 02:43.101
Amtrak station.

02:43.143 --> 02:45.338
O'Leary's getting on a train
to New York late tonight.

02:45.379 --> 02:47.677
Apparently, it's
stopping just for him.

02:47.715 --> 02:49.205
Fancy.

02:51.418 --> 02:52.715
This one's real
important, Frank.

02:52.753 --> 02:54.550
Who you telling?

02:58.092 --> 03:01.425
Listen, forget it.

03:01.462 --> 03:02.986
Want to stick around?
The game's on.

03:03.030 --> 03:04.725
I promised Daniel
I'd go sledding with him.

03:04.765 --> 03:07.063
Hey.

03:07.101 --> 03:08.728
Great.

03:13.774 --> 03:15.765
Just make sure O'Leary
doesn't get on that train.

03:43.504 --> 03:47.167
<i>The Lake Shore Limited Amtrak number 49</i>

03:47.207 --> 03:49.402
<i>now departing
for Cleveland, Toledo,</i>

03:49.443 --> 03:51.240
<i>South Bend and Chicago.</i>

03:51.278 --> 03:53.576
<i>Track nine. All aboard.</i>

03:53.614 --> 03:55.809
<i>...makes fun of Polish
people and that's just not funny.</i>

03:55.849 --> 03:57.976
<i>Polish jokes are funny
'cause they're about Poles.</i>

03:58.018 --> 03:59.883
<i>That's-- that's
why they're funny.</i>

03:59.920 --> 04:02.115
<i>You know like-- you take
a joke like this, you know.</i>

04:02.156 --> 04:04.147
<i>Um, how do you get
a one-armed Polack out of a tree?</i>

04:04.191 --> 04:06.250
<i>- How?
- You wave to him.</i>

04:06.293 --> 04:08.318
<i>- See, that's not funny.
- I think it's funny.</i>

04:08.362 --> 04:10.023
<i>They're not funny.
I'm Polish...</i>

04:32.286 --> 04:34.049
Mr. O'Leary,
the train's here.

04:35.155 --> 04:36.679
Where'd you get
that hat, James?

04:36.723 --> 04:39.157
I took it off a snowman.

04:39.193 --> 04:40.785
You look like an idiot.

04:40.828 --> 04:42.295
Yes, I do.

04:42.329 --> 04:44.058
You know, my grandfather

04:44.097 --> 04:45.997
was killed
at Pearl Harbor.

04:46.033 --> 04:48.558
- These guys are Chinese.
- I don't care.

04:48.602 --> 04:51.036
We need their money,
so shut up and smile.

04:54.074 --> 04:56.736
We'll bring you
back an egg roll.

04:59.446 --> 05:01.004
Here.

05:32.679 --> 05:34.544
- Uncle Roman.
- No no no. No excuses.

05:34.581 --> 05:37.516
- He never came.
- You slept right through it!

05:37.551 --> 05:39.712
O'Leary's been
in New York for an hour!

05:39.753 --> 05:41.380
I told you how
important this was.

05:41.421 --> 05:43.446
Let me go to New York.

05:43.490 --> 05:46.220
He'll be dead 15 minutes
after I get off the train.

05:46.260 --> 05:48.091
You know what
the Chinese money means?

05:48.128 --> 05:50.596
- All you had to do was kill him.
- I will.

05:50.631 --> 05:52.599
No no,
it's too late.

05:52.633 --> 05:55.693
When Eddie O'Leary
gets back from Chinatown,

05:55.736 --> 05:57.431
the Irish are
gonna take the...

05:57.471 --> 05:59.530
tiny piece of this city

05:59.573 --> 06:01.905
that the blacks
don't already have.

06:01.942 --> 06:04.638
And when that happens,
the Poles have nothing!

06:04.678 --> 06:07.408
Thank you!

06:07.447 --> 06:10.109
Oh God.
We've got to do something.

06:10.150 --> 06:12.448
Not we, Dad. Him.

06:12.486 --> 06:14.010
Just let me go to New York.

06:14.054 --> 06:16.614
- We're not talking about that.
- You've got a problem, Frank.

06:16.657 --> 06:19.524
Yeah, a substance abuse problem.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.289
We can't let you do this to the family.

06:21.328 --> 06:23.626
And we can't watch you
do it to yourself.

06:23.664 --> 06:25.359
I just need
a few days to rest.

06:25.399 --> 06:28.232
- Not good enough!
- Every time we send you out,

06:28.268 --> 06:30.395
I have to make
a call to find out if they're dead.

06:30.437 --> 06:32.132
I can't trust you
anymore, Frank!

06:32.172 --> 06:34.970
- Even if you are my nephew.
- You let us down.

06:35.008 --> 06:36.600
I want you to get yourself
into a program.

06:36.643 --> 06:38.406
- Like hell.
- No, I mean it.

06:38.445 --> 06:40.413
- I want you to go to San Francisco.
- Why?

06:42.015 --> 06:43.744
Because I said so.

06:43.784 --> 06:45.547
Look, you need to be
in a new environment.

06:45.586 --> 06:47.611
What, they don't
have beer there?

06:47.654 --> 06:50.282
Frank, we're just trying
to facilitate your recovery--

06:50.324 --> 06:52.792
All right now, Stef!
Put it to rest.

06:52.826 --> 06:55.920
Now, this is not
advice, Frank. This is it.

06:57.497 --> 06:59.658
You go to San Francisco...

06:59.700 --> 07:01.327
and get into AA

07:01.368 --> 07:03.268
and you clean yourself up!

07:06.640 --> 07:08.267
Or you don't
work for us anymore.

07:11.578 --> 07:13.978
And we can't let you
work for anybody else.

07:15.015 --> 07:17.609
Even if you are family.

07:18.652 --> 07:20.415
All right, then.

07:20.454 --> 07:22.445
Come on.
We've got streets to plow.

07:27.628 --> 07:29.960
Why San Francisco?

07:29.997 --> 07:32.261
We can look out
for you there.

07:32.299 --> 07:33.926
Roman's got a guy.

07:36.303 --> 07:38.635
Hey, you'll be getting
away from the snow.

07:38.672 --> 07:40.469
I like the snow.

07:40.507 --> 07:42.771
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

07:42.809 --> 07:44.902
So do you hate me now

07:44.945 --> 07:46.469
'cause I did this?

07:46.513 --> 07:48.845
Right now, pretty much.

07:48.882 --> 07:50.281
It won't last.

07:50.317 --> 07:52.649
Try me.

07:54.454 --> 07:56.319
I got you something.

08:01.495 --> 08:04.055
- So when do you think you'll be back?
- How the fuck do I know?

- Hello!
- Falenczyk?

09:10.130 --> 09:11.256
Yeah.

09:11.298 --> 09:13.163
Saint Margaret's,

09:13.200 --> 09:14.827
Geary and 28th,

09:14.868 --> 09:17.701
7:00 p.m. Be there.

09:19.206 --> 09:20.571
Great.

09:23.944 --> 09:25.434
Okay, so I just want
to let you all know

09:25.479 --> 09:28.448
that, uh, there
is a 12-step progress meeting

09:28.482 --> 09:30.746
here on Sunday night.

09:30.784 --> 09:32.308
I encourage
you all to attend,

09:32.352 --> 09:34.912
and uh, if you want to kick in
for coffee and doughnuts,

09:34.955 --> 09:37.082
see me after
tonight's meeting.

09:37.124 --> 09:38.921
Uh, also,
if you're parked

09:38.959 --> 09:40.483
in the back of the building,

09:40.527 --> 09:42.586
uh, you're gonna have
to move your car by 9:30.

09:42.629 --> 09:44.460
And, uh, one more thing

09:44.498 --> 09:46.466
before I give it
back to Emily

09:46.500 --> 09:49.435
The Rentals Association
is meeting here on Saturday,

09:49.469 --> 09:51.869
so I would encourage
you all to be here

09:51.905 --> 09:54.100
unless you want to see
your rent go up.

09:54.141 --> 09:55.768
Thanks, uh, Emily?

09:57.878 --> 09:59.743
Thanks, Juan.

09:59.780 --> 10:01.111
All right.

10:01.148 --> 10:04.379
Anybody new to the meeting
or visiting from someplace else?

10:05.652 --> 10:07.779
I'm Janet
and I'm an alcoholic,

10:07.821 --> 10:10.051
and I just moved
up from LA.

10:10.090 --> 10:11.819
- Hi Janet.
- Hi, Janet.

10:11.858 --> 10:13.325
Anyone else?

10:16.563 --> 10:18.428
All right, welcome.

10:18.465 --> 10:21.457
As I said before, my name
is Emily and I'm an alcoholic.

10:21.501 --> 10:23.765
Hi, Emily.

10:23.804 --> 10:27.570
Last November,
I celebrated my 10th birthday.

10:27.607 --> 10:31.043
No drinks,
no drugs for 10 years.

10:31.077 --> 10:32.669
I thought I had it down.

10:32.712 --> 10:35.909
I got sober
when I was 21

10:35.949 --> 10:38.577
and I figured at 31
things were different.

10:38.618 --> 10:40.643
So I went out
and had a drink.

10:40.687 --> 10:43.315
Just like that,
all grown up.

10:43.356 --> 10:46.257
And I woke up in the park
three days later.

10:48.829 --> 10:52.265
So--

11:01.174 --> 11:04.268
I'm almost glad
I slipped, uh...

11:04.311 --> 11:06.939
'cause it makes me
a grateful alcoholic.

11:07.981 --> 11:09.846
And the more
I live with that,

11:09.883 --> 11:13.046
the more I think it's the best way
for me to go through life--

11:13.086 --> 11:15.020
thankful.

11:15.055 --> 11:16.545
Thank you.

11:20.894 --> 11:23.294
Okay. Now it's
time for Juan

11:23.330 --> 11:25.855
to come up and give out
tonight's chips.

11:30.937 --> 11:33.872
So I'm Juan,
addict and alcoholic.

11:33.907 --> 11:35.738
Hi, Juan.

11:35.775 --> 11:39.302
Is there anyone here
with six months sobriety?

11:41.748 --> 11:43.511
Hey hey!

11:46.720 --> 11:48.210
Good for you.

12:00.767 --> 12:02.962
Leaving kind of early,
don't you think?

12:03.003 --> 12:04.470
Who the hell are you?

12:04.504 --> 12:06.096
Guy with a drinking
problem like yours

12:06.139 --> 12:08.073
probably ought
to stick around.

12:08.108 --> 12:09.803
Where you going now?

12:11.478 --> 12:14.174
Probably going
for a drink, I bet.

12:14.214 --> 12:16.774
It's a problem drink...

12:16.816 --> 12:19.114
'cause you've got a drinking problem.

12:21.454 --> 12:23.012
You fuck.

12:24.291 --> 12:26.987
- I'm watching you, Frank!
- Who are you?

12:28.295 --> 12:29.887
Roman called me
a few days ago

12:29.930 --> 12:32.194
to tell me you
were coming out.

12:33.900 --> 12:35.629
I'm the one who got
you to this meeting.

12:35.669 --> 12:37.432
Gee, thanks.

12:37.470 --> 12:40.371
Name is Dave.

12:40.407 --> 12:42.602
And I also got you
your apartment.

12:42.642 --> 12:44.837
I'm really scared.

12:44.878 --> 12:46.470
You shouldn't joke, Frank.

12:46.513 --> 12:48.845
In a town with a 2%
vacancy rate,

12:48.882 --> 12:50.577
a real estate agent is God.

12:50.617 --> 12:52.346
And that's what I am--
a real estate agent.

12:52.385 --> 12:55.445
It's a swell apartment,
Dave. Go away.

12:56.623 --> 12:58.090
Nope, I'm on
you till you leave.

12:58.124 --> 12:59.785
Can't stop me
from doing anything.

12:59.826 --> 13:01.623
I don't have to stop you.
All's I have to do

13:01.661 --> 13:04.459
is watch, wait and make
the call to Buffalo.

13:04.497 --> 13:06.727
You gonna run
and tell Mommy?

13:07.801 --> 13:10.065
That's right, Frank.

13:10.103 --> 13:12.003
I'm gonna run
and tell Mommy.

13:12.038 --> 13:13.562
Shit.

13:15.108 --> 13:16.666
- I'll see you in the morning.
- For what?

13:16.710 --> 13:18.405
Work.

13:23.516 --> 13:26.713
Fuck. Fuck.

13:31.424 --> 13:33.051
Hey, come on.

13:35.528 --> 13:37.359
It's kind of along
your line of work.

13:37.397 --> 13:39.888
- I don't need this.
- I don't give a shit what you need.

13:44.838 --> 13:47.068
- Doris.
- Dave.

13:48.942 --> 13:50.534
Where'd he live?

13:50.577 --> 13:52.636
Oh, in Pacific Heights.

13:53.813 --> 13:55.075
Own or rent?

13:55.115 --> 13:56.582
Own-- upstairs apartment,

13:56.616 --> 13:58.641
two bedroom.

13:58.685 --> 14:00.676
Swell.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.779
Keys are in his
pants over there.

14:05.792 --> 14:07.453
Ha ha, Doris.

14:09.329 --> 14:11.092
Come on.

14:14.501 --> 14:17.061
Frank Falenczyk,
meet Doris Rainford.

14:17.103 --> 14:20.470
Doris said she'd be
willing to hire you on.

14:20.507 --> 14:22.407
- As what?
- General help.

14:22.442 --> 14:24.342
- You'll love it.
- No, I won't love it.

14:24.377 --> 14:25.776
I won't love it so much
I'm not even gonna do it.

14:25.812 --> 14:27.575
- Yes! Yes, you--
- Like hell.

14:27.614 --> 14:30.082
You got an unorthodox way of
being interviewed for a job.

14:32.285 --> 14:33.980
Just-- keep--

14:36.723 --> 14:39.692
Listen, Roman said
to get you a job.

14:39.726 --> 14:42.092
This is it.
It's yours to fuck up.

14:42.128 --> 14:44.153
However,
if you fuck it up,

14:44.197 --> 14:46.563
I will be on the phone
to Buffalo.

14:51.538 --> 14:53.301
Guess what, Doris?

14:53.339 --> 14:55.330
Frank's decided
to take the job.

14:56.643 --> 14:58.133
Super.

15:02.482 --> 15:04.245
Hey.

15:37.283 --> 15:39.148
Hi, I'm Becky,

15:39.185 --> 15:41.085
addict and alcoholic.

15:41.121 --> 15:42.611
Hi.
Frank.

15:43.790 --> 15:45.257
Hand me a plate.

15:45.291 --> 15:46.781
Thanks.

15:52.332 --> 15:55.824
- I also got an eating disorder.
- Good for you.

15:55.869 --> 15:57.734
What, that I can say it?

15:57.770 --> 15:59.829
Yeah, it took me so long.

16:01.241 --> 16:03.141
And then I realized...

16:04.344 --> 16:05.868
I was never full because

16:05.912 --> 16:07.436
I felt so empty inside.

16:16.055 --> 16:19.047
No no, you're-- you're
not supposed to eat those.

16:19.092 --> 16:20.889
They're just
for show, okay?

16:20.927 --> 16:22.485
Oh.

16:23.930 --> 16:25.693
I'm kidding.

16:25.732 --> 16:27.359
- I'm Tom.
- Frank.

16:27.400 --> 16:31.063
- Hi. This your first time?
- I've had cookies before.

16:31.104 --> 16:32.833
Mmm.

16:33.907 --> 16:35.670
So what do you
think so far?

16:35.708 --> 16:37.300
It's all right.
A little talky.

16:37.343 --> 16:39.402
Yeah, you know, um,

16:39.445 --> 16:41.709
some people kinda
tend to wallow in it.

16:41.748 --> 16:43.739
But me, you know,

16:43.783 --> 16:46.149
I'll go months at a time
without saying anything.

16:48.454 --> 16:50.649
Plus, it's a really
good place to meet guys.

16:50.690 --> 16:53.056
Um, I'm not...

16:54.494 --> 16:56.052
It's okay.

16:56.095 --> 16:57.687
I'll get over it.

16:57.730 --> 17:00.426
Hi. Brenda, alcoholic.

17:00.466 --> 17:02.491
Hi, Brenda.

17:02.535 --> 17:04.025
Just a couple of things:

17:04.069 --> 17:05.662
They're ripping up
the playground next door,

17:05.704 --> 17:07.502
so you'll have
to park on the street

17:07.540 --> 17:08.700
for the next few weeks;

17:08.741 --> 17:11.232
Second, uh, I have
a new list of sponsors

17:11.277 --> 17:13.438
if anyone
is looking or...

17:13.479 --> 17:14.945
Looking to switch.

17:14.981 --> 17:16.915
Raise your hands
when I call your names.

17:16.950 --> 17:20.579
Tom, Robin and Susan

17:20.619 --> 17:22.281
have all volunteered.

17:22.321 --> 17:24.222
And the thing is, at a certain point,

17:24.257 --> 17:27.351
you just decide that
the bar is not an option.

17:28.394 --> 17:30.259
I just decide that?

17:30.296 --> 17:31.888
Odds are you're
gonna drink again.

17:31.931 --> 17:33.626
You have to want to quit.

17:33.666 --> 17:35.861
- It doesn't seem like you do.
- Part of me does.

17:35.902 --> 17:37.426
Which part?

17:37.470 --> 17:39.529
Some part I don't like.

17:39.572 --> 17:42.598
- Oh, like the dark meat on the chicken?
- Yeah.

17:42.642 --> 17:45.338
Frank...

17:45.378 --> 17:47.278
give it up
because you want to,

17:47.313 --> 17:49.975
not because everybody
in the room's staring at you.

17:50.016 --> 17:52.382
The first year,
it's all about trying.

17:52.418 --> 17:54.147
If you think it's
about solving your problem,

17:54.187 --> 17:56.246
you'll fail... a lot.

17:56.289 --> 17:57.813
I'm already
pretty good at that.

17:57.857 --> 18:00.792
You wouldn't be giving up
anything that you need.

18:01.995 --> 18:03.553
Does that mean
you're my sponsor?

18:03.596 --> 18:05.154
Does that mean
you're asking?

18:05.198 --> 18:07.928
Is this the part
where we kiss?

18:36.396 --> 18:38.694
Let's not make this any
harder than it's got to be.

18:38.731 --> 18:39.823
Thanks for coming.

18:39.866 --> 18:42.460
- Have a nice time in New York?
- I'm happy.

18:42.502 --> 18:44.129
You see any shows?

18:49.642 --> 18:51.701
Roman...

18:51.744 --> 18:53.644
nothing drastic
needs to happen.

18:54.747 --> 18:56.806
I'm completely agreeable.

18:56.849 --> 19:00.444
You can plow and I can
offer you 15c

19:00.486 --> 19:03.546
on every dollar that we take off
the union skim at Bethlehem Steel--

19:03.589 --> 19:05.580
You cleared this
with your Chinese daddy?

19:05.625 --> 19:07.525
Let's get something
straight, okay?

19:07.560 --> 19:10.620
They're just the money.
I still do all of my own--

19:10.663 --> 19:13.461
I started this business after the war--
me and Stan Falenczyk.

19:13.499 --> 19:15.899
- We had nothing but a plow--
- Would you please spare me

19:15.935 --> 19:17.459
that GI Diary bullshit?

19:17.503 --> 19:19.937
You and that other
thug started a gang

19:19.972 --> 19:21.599
just like everybody
else around here.

19:21.641 --> 19:24.235
You got rich, you had a good run,
and now it's time to retire.

19:24.277 --> 19:25.801
Hey!

19:25.845 --> 19:27.972
This isn't just about business,
you Irish asshole.

19:28.014 --> 19:29.914
This is what I do.

19:29.949 --> 19:33.043
If you take it, there isn't
dick left for me in Buffalo.

19:36.122 --> 19:37.749
Well, then get
out of Buffalo.

19:59.746 --> 20:01.680
Hey, are you Frank?

20:02.715 --> 20:04.376
That's me.

20:04.417 --> 20:07.181
- Doris said you could help me.
- I'm not following.

20:07.220 --> 20:08.710
I'm Laurel Pearson.

20:08.755 --> 20:10.279
I'm looking
for my stepfather.

20:10.323 --> 20:13.292
- And there he is.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

20:13.326 --> 20:14.953
Don't worry about it.
He's already dead.

20:16.662 --> 20:18.994
What'd he do,
tie it himself?

20:19.031 --> 20:20.965
It's not that
easy in reverse.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.662
Mm-hmm. We need
to change his shoes.

20:23.703 --> 20:25.295
- We do?
- Yep.

20:25.338 --> 20:27.203
Mom wanted him buried
in his favorite shoes.

20:27.240 --> 20:29.800
He was a big bowler.

20:33.980 --> 20:35.572
You don't seem
too broken up.

20:37.150 --> 20:39.414
- Even people you don't like die.
- Yeah.

20:39.452 --> 20:42.285
I was thinking he
kind of looked like a prick.

20:42.321 --> 20:45.017
- If you don't mind me saying.
- No.

20:45.057 --> 20:47.252
No, not at all.

20:47.293 --> 20:49.022
Also...

20:49.061 --> 20:51.256
he-- he seems
to have enormous feet.

20:51.297 --> 20:53.060
Yeah, well, those
aren't his shoes.

20:53.099 --> 20:54.498
I couldn't find his.

20:54.534 --> 20:56.559
I stole those
from the Chestnut Lanes.

20:56.602 --> 20:58.001
Don't tell my mom.

21:01.441 --> 21:03.306
Might have to
break his toes.

21:04.644 --> 21:06.874
Whatever gets the job done.

21:15.922 --> 21:17.446
You look beautiful.

21:22.895 --> 21:25.693
He looks real nice.
Good job.

21:25.731 --> 21:27.062
Thanks.

21:27.099 --> 21:29.465
Next time you might want
to ease up on the rouge.

21:29.502 --> 21:32.369
He's looking
a little Raggedy Andy.

21:34.540 --> 21:37.600
I wanted to thank you.
Abe looks like a real sport.

21:37.643 --> 21:39.235
I'm glad you're pleased.

21:39.278 --> 21:42.406
I'm sure he appreciates
how much care you gave to--

21:43.983 --> 21:45.746
well, to make
every-- everything--

21:45.785 --> 21:48.276
Take it easy, Mom.
Here.

21:50.056 --> 21:53.514
Just think, he's going out
wearing his favorite shoes.

21:53.559 --> 21:55.686
- And they fit like a glove.
- Oh.

21:55.728 --> 21:58.458
Can I help you to the car, ma'am?

21:58.498 --> 22:00.398
That'd be fine.
Thank you.

22:01.434 --> 22:03.061
Hang on a second.

22:10.343 --> 22:12.402
His lipstick was smeared.

22:12.445 --> 22:14.913
I got the eyes down.
I'm still working on the mouth.

22:16.382 --> 22:17.906
You like working
with makeup?

22:17.950 --> 22:21.818
I prefer it on women, really.

22:21.854 --> 22:24.687
Guess it's hard to meet real live ones
in your line of work.

22:24.724 --> 22:26.817
I'm usually in the back.

22:26.859 --> 22:29.020
Although I've heard of
some people in your position,

22:29.061 --> 22:31.086
you know, making do.

22:35.902 --> 22:37.767
I'll see you there.

22:37.803 --> 22:39.668
Thank you.

22:39.705 --> 22:41.366
You're very strong.

22:43.376 --> 22:45.970
Think my mother
might think you're cute.

22:46.012 --> 22:47.673
She's been through a lot.

22:49.148 --> 22:51.173
Hey, so maybe
I'll see you soon.

22:51.217 --> 22:53.549
Jeez, I hope not.
Mom's still pretty frisky.

22:55.721 --> 22:58.053
And I'm perfectly healthy.

22:58.090 --> 22:59.557
No, look, if nobody dies,

22:59.592 --> 23:01.219
maybe we could
get coffee sometime.

23:02.895 --> 23:04.658
Sure.
That'd be nice.

24:04.523 --> 24:06.491
It's a housewarming present.

24:08.794 --> 24:12.252
No. Yeah, right.
I forgot, you're a killer.

24:12.298 --> 24:13.959
What do you want?

24:14.000 --> 24:17.367
Roman wanted to make sure
you were okay out here.

24:19.171 --> 24:21.696
I know you know he's
got his hands full back in Buffalo.

24:21.741 --> 24:23.971
So...

24:25.244 --> 24:26.836
I said I'd check.
I checked.

24:26.879 --> 24:28.676
- And?
- Mmm.

24:28.714 --> 24:32.172
You ball your socks,
you floss.

24:32.218 --> 24:34.880
And you don't hide booze
in the toilet tank.

24:38.591 --> 24:41.355
- You live like a Mormon.
- You want to look up my ass, too?

24:42.561 --> 24:44.051
Maybe later.

24:45.498 --> 24:47.227
Cashew butter...

24:47.266 --> 24:51.635
Mmm, it's like peanut butter,
but with cashews.

24:51.671 --> 24:54.037
Well, what is
wrong with peanuts?

24:57.877 --> 25:00.846
Remind me to be
nice to you, cock.

25:08.187 --> 25:10.519
Hello?

25:10.556 --> 25:13.218
- Hello, Laurel?
- Who's this?

25:13.259 --> 25:16.592
Frank.
Frank Falenczyk...

25:16.629 --> 25:18.324
from the funeral home.

25:18.364 --> 25:20.161
Finally.

25:20.199 --> 25:21.996
What?

25:22.034 --> 25:24.867
Frank Falenczyk,
funeral, finally.

25:24.904 --> 25:26.701
Just playing with the F's.

25:26.739 --> 25:28.206
For fun.

25:28.240 --> 25:29.707
Oh, hmm.

25:29.742 --> 25:31.232
Uh...

25:31.277 --> 25:32.744
fabulous.

25:32.778 --> 25:34.678
- I'm glad you called.
- Yeah?

25:34.714 --> 25:36.909
Yeah, I need
those shoes back.

25:36.949 --> 25:38.177
What?

25:38.217 --> 25:41.209
Just kidding, Frank.

25:42.288 --> 25:44.313
Listen...

25:44.356 --> 25:46.347
- Do you want to go out tonight?
- Out?

25:46.392 --> 25:48.952
- Yeah, with me.
- Oh, "out."

25:52.031 --> 25:53.589
Well, yeah.

25:54.600 --> 25:56.090
Fucking great.
I'm there.

25:56.135 --> 25:57.864
- Where?
- What?

25:57.903 --> 26:00.303
Calling you is about as far
as I got planning wise.

26:01.640 --> 26:03.801
- Well, I know places.
- Great.

26:03.843 --> 26:05.811
- Frank.
- Yeah?

26:06.979 --> 26:08.947
I'm glad my
stepfather died.

26:14.153 --> 26:16.883
You know,
it's a whole lot easier

26:16.922 --> 26:19.550
fucking girls you don't like

26:19.592 --> 26:21.116
when you're really drunk.

26:21.160 --> 26:24.425
I realize that may
sound harsh,

26:24.463 --> 26:26.363
but in my defense, a lot
of them were drunk too.

26:27.700 --> 26:29.998
If anyone was being
taken advantage of,

26:30.035 --> 26:31.559
it was me.

26:31.604 --> 26:34.038
And that had to stop.

26:34.073 --> 26:35.836
Because it was there...

26:35.875 --> 26:37.433
See you tomorrow.

26:39.245 --> 26:40.974
...but it gets
old pretty quick

26:41.013 --> 26:43.038
in terms
of nailing chicks.

26:43.082 --> 26:45.073
Why am I here?

26:45.117 --> 26:46.744
Frank.

26:48.287 --> 26:49.845
Frank.

26:49.889 --> 26:51.356
You okay?

26:51.390 --> 26:53.585
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- So where are you headed?

26:53.626 --> 26:57.289
I have a...
thing to do.

26:59.899 --> 27:02.424
You know, if you're
going to drink, drink.

27:02.468 --> 27:05.028
But please don't feel like
you need to lie to me--

27:05.070 --> 27:07.698
I'm not gonna drink.

27:07.740 --> 27:09.799
- Okay. See you.
- No, really.

27:09.842 --> 27:11.867
Um, I mean--

27:13.979 --> 27:15.674
I have a--

27:16.882 --> 27:18.747
A what, Frank?

27:18.784 --> 27:21.981
A date.
Is that okay?

27:22.021 --> 27:23.750
- You think it's okay?
- I don't know.

27:23.789 --> 27:25.654
I'm not sure I've
ever done it sober.

27:25.691 --> 27:27.591
That's why at the beginning
there's not always room

27:27.626 --> 27:30.686
for both the program
and women.

27:30.729 --> 27:33.197
Or men for that matter.

27:33.232 --> 27:35.393
And you should just
know going into it

27:35.434 --> 27:37.527
that... there's
the possibility

27:37.570 --> 27:39.629
it might not turn out
that well, that's all.

27:39.672 --> 27:41.970
You're giving me
tremendous confidence here.

27:42.007 --> 27:44.703
L-- I just mean that...

27:44.743 --> 27:46.836
you might be more raw
than you realize.

27:47.613 --> 27:48.944
Do you mind if I ask what you do?

27:48.981 --> 27:50.972
I sell time.

27:51.016 --> 27:52.608
I thought that
was still free.

27:52.651 --> 27:55.984
Only on PBS, and even then
you've got to buy a tote bag.

27:56.021 --> 27:57.545
You lost me again.

27:57.590 --> 27:59.581
Commercial time
for Channel 8.

27:59.625 --> 28:03.061
I was the Bay Area's
top selling rep last year.

28:03.095 --> 28:05.222
They gave me a plaque
to hang on the wall.

28:05.264 --> 28:07.357
Hey, congratulations.

28:07.399 --> 28:10.095
It's not like the advertisers
had any choice.

28:10.135 --> 28:12.695
The word "no" means nothing to me.

28:20.779 --> 28:23.771
- I should tell you something.
- You're gay.

28:23.816 --> 28:26.979
I'm in AA.
I just started.

28:27.019 --> 28:28.919
I'm raw.

28:30.256 --> 28:31.814
Oh.

28:33.325 --> 28:36.021
Well, are--
are you okay?

28:36.061 --> 28:38.325
I mean, you're not gonna

28:38.364 --> 28:40.025
run out right now
and get wrecked, are you?

28:40.065 --> 28:43.523
- No. I'm fine.
- Well, okay then.

28:43.569 --> 28:45.366
As long as you're not gay.

28:45.404 --> 28:47.429
Thanks for telling me.

28:47.473 --> 28:49.464
It doesn't bother you?

28:49.508 --> 28:51.669
- You said you just started, right?
- Right.

28:51.710 --> 28:53.575
- How many people have you told?
- So far...

28:55.681 --> 28:57.842
- you.
- Why me?

28:57.883 --> 28:59.748
I don't know.

28:59.785 --> 29:02.618
It seemed important
to start off honest.

29:05.424 --> 29:09.326
Mmm, that doesn't
bother me at all.

29:13.866 --> 29:16.630
Besides, if I had to deal with dead
bodies all day, I'd be drinking too.

29:16.669 --> 29:18.398
Oh, I'm okay
with the dead bodies.

29:22.541 --> 29:24.031
I came to believe

29:24.076 --> 29:26.237
that a power
greater than myself

29:26.278 --> 29:29.304
could restore me to sanity.

29:29.348 --> 29:30.872
Thank you.

29:30.916 --> 29:33.612
- Do you believe in God?
- I went to First Communion.

29:33.652 --> 29:35.279
Think that's
the last time I saw Him.

29:35.321 --> 29:36.948
Well, uh,
it doesn't have to be

29:36.989 --> 29:38.889
the guy on the cross
or a golden calf.

29:38.924 --> 29:41.893
You know, it can be-- be anything.
It's a God of your understanding.

29:41.927 --> 29:44.691
You know, you can
make it a mountain,

29:44.730 --> 29:46.664
make it a bridge,
make it whatever you want.

29:46.699 --> 29:49.930
Just make it something big,
something good and not yourself.

29:58.410 --> 30:00.401
I generally like
to run my own show.

30:00.446 --> 30:03.381
Yeah, you've done
a real good job of that so far.

30:03.415 --> 30:05.610
- Thank you.
- Even if I did believe in God,

30:05.651 --> 30:07.846
I'm not so sure he'd want to have
anything to do with me.

30:07.886 --> 30:10.855
Oh, the alcoholic's God
is a very forgiving God, Frank.

30:10.889 --> 30:12.948
He's got to be.

30:15.260 --> 30:16.818
I kill people.

30:18.497 --> 30:20.727
- Excuse me?
- It's my job.

30:20.766 --> 30:22.631
I've been doing it
almost my whole life.

30:22.668 --> 30:24.192
I mean, I get
paid to do it.

30:24.236 --> 30:26.636
I don't just
pick 'em randomly.

30:26.672 --> 30:29.334
In any case,
I don't feel much guilt about it.

30:29.375 --> 30:32.276
My drinking was interfering
with my work.

30:32.311 --> 30:34.040
That's why I'm here,
so I can get sober

30:34.079 --> 30:36.377
and go back to killing
people full time.

30:39.051 --> 30:41.747
- Did you hear what I said?
- I-- I-- I did hear you.

30:41.787 --> 30:44.278
I'm just trying to figure out
if you're being serious or not.

30:44.323 --> 30:47.724
- What do you think?
- I think you're being serious.

30:49.028 --> 30:51.121
Hello, my--

30:51.163 --> 30:52.630
I hope this
doesn't scare you off.

30:52.664 --> 30:54.291
Hey, I gave you a 20.

30:54.333 --> 30:56.198
No, I--

30:56.235 --> 30:58.169
I-- I just want to know

30:58.203 --> 31:00.262
that it's not something
you do for recreation.

31:00.305 --> 31:01.499
No, it's not.

31:01.540 --> 31:03.405
Hey, you gave me
the wrong change.

31:03.442 --> 31:05.103
Are you drunk
when you do this?

31:05.144 --> 31:06.736
Not always.

31:06.779 --> 31:08.542
But sometimes
I couldn't go drinking

31:08.580 --> 31:11.174
'cause I had
to kill somebody.

31:11.216 --> 31:13.616
And sometimes
I'd miss killing somebody

31:13.652 --> 31:15.176
'cause I was out drinking.

31:15.220 --> 31:16.778
To think I was, uh,

31:16.822 --> 31:18.346
nervous about you
going on a date.

31:18.390 --> 31:19.857
- Hello.
- Yeah?

31:19.892 --> 31:21.985
- My change.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

31:22.027 --> 31:25.588
- What'd you give me?
- Just keep it.

31:27.099 --> 31:28.589
I don't know
how you do this.

31:38.177 --> 31:41.010
- Hello.
- I'm just waiting for my wife.

31:41.046 --> 31:44.106
- She's trying on bikinis in there.
- Stef.

31:44.149 --> 31:45.878
Really, I have to tell her
if she looks good or not.

31:45.918 --> 31:47.943
No. You have to
stay out here.

31:49.221 --> 31:51.280
- Where are you?
- At the mall.

31:51.323 --> 31:53.587
So why are you
calling me?

31:53.625 --> 31:56.617
Hey, remember when you
had to go to Florida for six months

31:56.662 --> 31:58.653
after that
Canadian thing?

31:58.697 --> 32:01.928
- Yeah.
- How was that for kids? Did--

32:01.967 --> 32:04.367
- did they have a pool?
- What's going on, Stef?

32:04.403 --> 32:07.839
Pam and Daniel are going
down there for a while.

32:07.873 --> 32:09.704
You're not
going with them?

32:09.741 --> 32:11.402
They have to go.

32:11.443 --> 32:13.104
I have to stay.

32:13.145 --> 32:14.737
O'Leary's being
an asshole.

32:14.780 --> 32:17.305
Watch your back.
They might come after you.

32:17.349 --> 32:20.409
- You want me to come home?
- Nah, forget it.

32:21.487 --> 32:23.079
You're out,
stay out--

32:23.122 --> 32:24.987
Yeah, Stef,
but I should be there.

32:25.023 --> 32:26.991
Guess I just wanted
to hear your voice.

32:27.025 --> 32:29.323
♪ Dupayash! ♪

32:29.361 --> 32:31.158
Yeah.

You're not pregnant,
are you?

32:49.915 --> 32:52.645
Not unless you put
something in my egg roll.

32:52.684 --> 32:54.709
And then put my
egg roll in my--

32:54.753 --> 32:57.347
- Did I tell you where I lived?
- No, you didn't.

32:57.389 --> 33:00.051
I called the funeral home.

33:00.092 --> 33:02.287
Doris didn't
want to tell me.

33:02.327 --> 33:04.192
Then I told her I was
from the AIDS clinic

33:04.229 --> 33:06.163
and had to get you
your test results,

33:06.198 --> 33:08.325
you know, right away.

33:08.367 --> 33:10.392
Oh, good.

33:10.435 --> 33:12.699
I can't wait
to see her.

33:14.606 --> 33:16.164
Come on,
I'll walk with you.

33:22.414 --> 33:24.211
You should try this.

33:24.249 --> 33:26.774
It's easier on the shins.

33:26.818 --> 33:29.013
So you're coming
to dinner at my house.

33:29.054 --> 33:31.955
It's 9:00 in the morning.
Can we make it later?

33:31.990 --> 33:34.390
- Later, sure, but you'll be there.
- Okay.

33:34.426 --> 33:36.189
- See you tonight then.
- Hey, wouldn't want

33:36.228 --> 33:39.425
- to take me down the rest of the way?
- Maybe later.

33:41.466 --> 33:44.128
Hi. How are
the dead this morning?

33:44.169 --> 33:45.466
Shut up.

33:45.504 --> 33:48.701
- I'm in a good mood, okay?
- Not on my time.

33:48.740 --> 33:50.264
Who's this?

33:50.309 --> 33:52.402
- Patrick Heaney.
- What happened?

33:52.444 --> 33:54.378
Well, Mr. Heaney
had a heart attack

33:54.413 --> 33:57.109
on top of a long
flight of stairs.

33:58.116 --> 33:59.708
Ouch.

33:59.751 --> 34:02.049
Yeah. Wake's tonight.

34:02.087 --> 34:05.147
He's got to be flushed,
prepped and casketed by 4:00.

34:05.190 --> 34:07.522
I look forward to working
with you, Dr. Rainford.

34:07.559 --> 34:09.925
Jesus, you're annoying
when you're happy.

34:50.002 --> 34:52.562
Now that is one
good-looking dead man.

35:16.628 --> 35:19.096
Ah! I'm drinking that.

35:19.131 --> 35:20.826
Sorry.

35:20.866 --> 35:22.800
He hasn't looked
that alive in years.

35:23.902 --> 35:25.392
I was working
from old pictures.

35:26.405 --> 35:28.134
- You did this?
- Mm-hmm.

35:28.173 --> 35:30.038
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

35:30.075 --> 35:33.306
God bless you.
You did good work here.

35:33.345 --> 35:35.609
I'm Walter Fitzgerald.

35:35.647 --> 35:37.444
Frank Falenczyk.

35:37.482 --> 35:40.144
Patrick here
was my wife's brother.

35:40.185 --> 35:42.619
She's taking it pretty hard

35:42.654 --> 35:45.987
- I can see that.
- Would you have a drink with us, Frank?

35:46.024 --> 35:48.618
No, thank you.
I'm trying to quit.

35:48.660 --> 35:51.026
I tried that once.
Didn't take.

35:51.063 --> 35:52.758
When did you start?

35:52.798 --> 35:54.629
- Not too long ago.
- What's the difference then?

35:54.666 --> 35:57.157
- Have a nip.
- No, really. Thank you.

35:57.202 --> 36:00.228
You'd refuse a dying man
his last request?

36:00.272 --> 36:02.035
Sorry.
You dying?

36:02.074 --> 36:04.770
For fuck's sake,
I'm talking about Patrick.

36:04.810 --> 36:06.641
That's what this
party's all about--

36:06.678 --> 36:08.305
sending him on his way.

36:08.347 --> 36:10.372
Thank you. Really.

36:10.415 --> 36:12.280
I can't.
I'm working.

36:12.317 --> 36:13.909
I got to keep
an eye on things.

36:15.020 --> 36:17.045
He's not going anywhere.

36:17.089 --> 36:19.057
Ah, Katie!

36:19.091 --> 36:20.991
This is Frank
from the parlor.

36:21.026 --> 36:23.517
He's who fixed up
our Patrick all nice like this.

36:23.562 --> 36:25.427
Oh, God bless you.

36:25.464 --> 36:27.125
Oh, that's nice.

36:27.165 --> 36:28.962
Margie Rose.
Margie, look.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.833
This is the man who
fixed Patrick's cheekbones.

36:33.038 --> 36:34.562
Aw, bless your heart.

36:34.606 --> 36:36.233
Will you have a drink
with us, Frank, huh?

36:36.274 --> 36:38.708
- Uh, really, I shouldn't.
- Says he's on the wagon.

36:38.744 --> 36:40.678
Really? What is he,
some kind of Mary?

36:42.447 --> 36:44.642
To Patrick!

36:44.683 --> 36:47.117
May neighbors
respect you,

36:47.152 --> 36:51.111
troubles neglect you,
the angels protect you

36:51.156 --> 36:52.748
and Heaven accept you.

36:52.791 --> 36:54.952
To Patrick, the biggest
pain in my ass!

36:54.993 --> 36:57.427

36:57.462 --> 36:59.430
thought of having.

38:12.904 --> 38:15.771
Walter will come and pick up
the car in the morning...

38:15.807 --> 38:17.832
- after Mass.
- Aw, for fuck's sake.

38:17.876 --> 38:19.639
Come on!
I'll drive your car.

38:19.678 --> 38:21.339
I can walk home from there.

38:21.379 --> 38:22.971
You don't know
where we live.

38:23.014 --> 38:24.538
Nonsense, nonsense!

38:24.583 --> 38:26.983
The bus is for cripples
and old people.

38:27.018 --> 38:28.849
All right, okay.

38:35.060 --> 38:37.688
Left is your brakes, right is your gas

38:37.729 --> 38:39.560
and everything
else is the same.

38:39.598 --> 38:41.361
Right.

38:41.399 --> 38:44.129
It's all right.

38:46.771 --> 38:49.001
Think you could pull over maybe?

38:49.040 --> 38:51.065
I've got the bladder
of an 80-year-old man.

38:51.109 --> 38:52.906
Walter, we're almost home.

38:52.944 --> 38:55.037

- Would you like to hold it for me?

40:44.556 --> 40:46.251
I missed dinner
last night

40:46.291 --> 40:49.590

with little Irish people.

40:49.628 --> 40:52.324
Well, you missed

41:23.962 --> 41:26.055
You haven't
heard them from me.

messing with my work.

41:33.705 --> 41:36.003

No, that's temporary.

- Frank.

42:03.568 --> 42:05.263
Everybody, here's Frank.

42:12.010 --> 42:13.910
Hi, I'm Frank
and I'm an alcoholic.

42:13.945 --> 42:15.412
Hi, Frank.

42:15.447 --> 42:16.971
Yeah.

42:17.015 --> 42:19.347
I didn't really know

42:19.384 --> 42:21.079
I was an alcoholic
until recently.

42:21.119 --> 42:22.950
I'm from Buffalo.

42:22.987 --> 42:24.682
Drinking's a pretty
obvious thing to do there

42:24.723 --> 42:28.523
and, you know, there's
work and then there's...

42:28.560 --> 42:30.551
whatever you do when
you're not working.

42:30.595 --> 42:33.655
And I was either
working or drinking.

42:33.698 --> 42:35.723
And...

42:35.767 --> 42:38.531
I guess I thought I kept
the two pretty well separated.

42:38.570 --> 42:41.539
It had to be pointed out
to me that that wasn't...

42:41.573 --> 42:43.234
really true.

42:51.382 --> 42:52.940
I kill people.

42:55.887 --> 42:58.117
Not with my drinking.

42:58.156 --> 43:00.021
I actually kill people...

43:01.593 --> 43:03.083
for a living.

43:04.562 --> 43:06.894
I guess that makes me
fucked up, I don't know.

43:06.931 --> 43:08.455
It's the only job
I've ever had

43:08.500 --> 43:10.195
and I'm good at it,
at least I was.

43:12.036 --> 43:13.799
It's like any business.

43:13.838 --> 43:16.363
You-- you have competition,
you identify them,

43:16.407 --> 43:18.034
you offer
to buy them out.

43:18.076 --> 43:19.566
They don't agree,
you go to other means.

43:19.611 --> 43:23.047
Everybody I killed
knew it was a possibility.

43:27.218 --> 43:29.049
I've heard people here

43:29.087 --> 43:30.850
blame a lot of stuff
on their families.

43:32.023 --> 43:33.786
I don't know.

43:33.825 --> 43:35.554
I like mine.
I got a choice--

43:37.896 --> 43:39.693
drinking or them.

43:41.266 --> 43:43.564
I don't know the exact definition
of the word "alcoholic,"

43:43.601 --> 43:45.899
but from what
I'm hearing here,

43:45.937 --> 43:47.666
sounds like I'm
a pretty good one.

43:49.340 --> 43:52.070
I'm an even better killer.

43:52.110 --> 43:55.079
I want to do it again.
I will do it again.

43:56.347 --> 43:57.871
But I know now,

43:57.916 --> 44:00.043
the only way I'm ever
gonna get to do it again

44:00.084 --> 44:03.315
is if
I stop drinking...

44:05.857 --> 44:07.347
forever.

44:08.726 --> 44:10.455
Amen.

44:11.796 --> 44:13.320
I know now
I can't do it alone.

44:15.733 --> 44:17.530
Proved that to myself
last night.

44:20.471 --> 44:22.371
I'm not even sure
I can do it here.

44:25.176 --> 44:27.701
And I'm really scared.

44:27.745 --> 44:29.235
Thanks.

44:43.261 --> 44:45.388
Well, thanks
for that, Frank.

44:47.699 --> 44:50.827
Actually, it went better
than you think. It did.

44:50.869 --> 44:52.769
How do you know they
won't tell the police?

44:52.804 --> 44:55.136
It's Alcoholics Anonymous.

44:55.173 --> 44:57.869
Somehow I don't really feel
that's what they had in mind

44:57.909 --> 45:00.901
when they came up with the name,
but you never know.

45:02.313 --> 45:03.905
How do you kill them?

45:03.948 --> 45:05.540
Well, you just
put it on a level

45:05.583 --> 45:07.448
with everything else

45:07.485 --> 45:09.180
and you don't
think about it.

45:09.220 --> 45:12.053
That's deep, Frank,
but I meant literally, how do you do it?

45:12.090 --> 45:13.887
Guns, mostly.

45:14.959 --> 45:17.154
I need a drink.

45:17.195 --> 45:18.822
Can you give me a moment?

45:18.863 --> 45:21.195
Of course.

45:25.603 --> 45:27.867
I know it's kind of
a lot to swallow.

45:27.906 --> 45:29.533
You're right.

45:34.112 --> 45:35.602
Why should I bother?

45:35.647 --> 45:38.081
Because you don't want
to be alone any more than I do.

45:43.054 --> 45:44.988
You know, it's sad,

45:45.023 --> 45:47.753
but that's actually
good enough for right now.

45:52.196 --> 45:54.255
Here.

45:54.299 --> 45:56.597
Go kill something.

45:58.836 --> 46:01.134
Well, I'll pick 'em up myself.

46:02.674 --> 46:05.108
That's a bullshit
excuse, Bill.

46:05.143 --> 46:07.134
No, I don't have to try
and understand anything.

46:07.178 --> 46:08.645
Everything I need to know

46:08.680 --> 46:11.148
I already understand
pretty goddamn well.

46:11.182 --> 46:14.174
So stay at home, Bill,
crack a six pack, watch your TV

46:14.218 --> 46:16.209
and make yourself
comfortable,

46:16.254 --> 46:17.846
'cause you just
made a big mistake.

46:17.889 --> 46:19.754
Who was that?

46:19.791 --> 46:21.986
- Bill Kubala.
- Guy from Diecast Direct.

46:22.026 --> 46:24.756
He says they're
out of parts.

46:24.796 --> 46:26.593
The parts guy
is out of parts.

46:28.232 --> 46:29.460
God!

46:31.302 --> 46:33.896
That Irish bastard
is closing his fist.

46:35.673 --> 46:37.573
Maybe we should
call the Greeks.

46:40.111 --> 46:41.976
- Dad?
- Yeah, all right. Fine.

46:42.013 --> 46:45.278
Let's call the goddamn Greeks.

46:46.718 --> 46:48.481
You know, it used to be
shit like this happened,

46:48.519 --> 46:50.544
we could just call Frank.

46:50.588 --> 46:52.920
Frank's not here.

46:52.957 --> 46:55.118
Lucky fuck.

46:56.995 --> 46:59.987
President William McKinley
was assassinated in Buffalo

47:00.031 --> 47:02.295
at the Pan-American
Exposition.

47:02.333 --> 47:04.198
Somebody shot
a president in Buffalo

47:04.235 --> 47:06.430
and you thought,
"Wow, that's for me"?

47:06.471 --> 47:08.905
No, see, he was
shot on the sixth,

47:08.940 --> 47:10.965
but he didn't die
till the 14th.

47:11.009 --> 47:13.239
For eight days he was
lying around in some mansion

47:13.277 --> 47:15.802
while the doctors tried
to find the bullet.

47:17.949 --> 47:20.110
Oh, yes!

47:21.452 --> 47:23.317
No, I still--
I don't see.

47:23.354 --> 47:24.787
They were using
an x-ray machine,

47:24.822 --> 47:27.848
but he was lying on a bed
with metal springs.

47:27.892 --> 47:30.986
So they couldn't find the bullet.
He got sicker and died.

47:31.029 --> 47:32.929
Isn't that the kind of story
that's supposed to make you

47:32.964 --> 47:34.522
grow up and become a doctor?

47:34.565 --> 47:37.398
I saw the point in all
that poking around and malingering.

47:38.569 --> 47:40.537
You shoot somebody,
you should kill them.

47:42.874 --> 47:45.240
I saw the need
for precision.

47:46.477 --> 47:48.206
Oh!

47:48.246 --> 47:49.873
Gutter ball.

47:56.254 --> 47:58.245
Can I get you
anything to drink?

47:58.289 --> 48:00.223
I've got some
great tap water.

48:01.592 --> 48:03.321
Comes out of that
tap right there.

48:05.863 --> 48:07.490
Coffee?

48:07.532 --> 48:09.693
It's a little late
in the day for me.

48:15.440 --> 48:17.135
Why are you so nervous?

48:17.175 --> 48:18.699
Coffee.

48:23.414 --> 48:25.507
I like older men.

48:25.550 --> 48:26.881
Why?

48:26.918 --> 48:29.580
Because you're done experimenting.

48:29.620 --> 48:31.383
You're not gonna
wake up tomorrow

48:31.422 --> 48:33.117
and tell my you're gay.

48:34.158 --> 48:35.785
What about the drinking

48:35.827 --> 48:37.692
and the other thing?

48:38.930 --> 48:41.091
Nobody's perfect, Frank.

48:44.902 --> 48:46.927
- Coffee.
- Morning.

48:49.941 --> 48:51.465
What are you
thinking about

48:51.509 --> 48:53.636
sitting there
all serious?

48:53.678 --> 48:55.339
My shortcomings.

48:56.948 --> 48:58.779
Women don't even
pay attention to that.

49:00.351 --> 49:02.876
I'm talking about this.

49:02.920 --> 49:06.219
Oh, what is it?

49:06.257 --> 49:07.884
People I've harmed.

49:09.494 --> 49:11.121
You mean killed?

49:11.162 --> 49:13.494
Well, eventually.

49:13.531 --> 49:15.396
That's not the point.
I mean harmed.

49:15.433 --> 49:18.027
The people
I've killed badly

49:18.069 --> 49:20.162
because I was drunk.

49:21.639 --> 49:23.163
This is your whole
precision thing?

49:23.207 --> 49:24.697
Yeah.

49:25.977 --> 49:27.877
Like here.
Look, Rod Fitzhugh.

49:28.913 --> 49:31.006
Took me seven bullets.

49:32.517 --> 49:34.508
And Karen Whittier,
I was supposed to slit her throat.

49:34.552 --> 49:36.417
She moved.
I got her in the eye.

49:36.454 --> 49:38.319
Fuck, Frank.

49:39.457 --> 49:41.357
It's a little early
in the morning.

49:42.426 --> 49:44.519
Well, I'm serious.
Jack Hensley.

49:44.562 --> 49:47.827
He saw me first. I had to chase him
two blocks before I got him

49:47.865 --> 49:49.389
in a Dairy Queen
parking lot.

49:49.433 --> 49:50.957
That's no way to die.

49:51.002 --> 49:52.594
So you got sloppy.

49:52.637 --> 49:55.800
You can't unkill them.
They're still dead.

49:55.840 --> 49:59.071
I don't regret killing them,
just killing them badly.

50:01.145 --> 50:03.010
So what, then?

50:03.047 --> 50:04.571
I got to make amends.

50:07.618 --> 50:11.952
There are many
rewards that flow...

50:11.989 --> 50:13.889
from the practice
of making amends.

50:16.827 --> 50:18.522
So that's what you do.

50:18.563 --> 50:20.428
And you do
what you have to do.

50:20.464 --> 50:22.523
Thanks.

50:24.936 --> 50:28.736
All right, these can be redeemed
in any of our stores nationwide.

50:34.745 --> 50:37.111
That's five $25 gift certificates.

50:40.184 --> 50:42.880
Well, I can't believe you had
the addresses of their next of kin.

50:42.920 --> 50:47.084
Even drunk, I kept
thorough records.

50:48.392 --> 50:50.724
So a knife in the eye

50:50.761 --> 50:53.286
is worth 50 bucks off
your next purchase at the Sony store?

50:55.066 --> 50:56.590
It's a start.

50:56.634 --> 50:59.535
...to accept the things I cannot change,

50:59.570 --> 51:01.800
the courage to change
the things I can,

51:01.839 --> 51:04.706
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

51:04.742 --> 51:06.334
Amen.

51:06.377 --> 51:08.277
Let me have a couple
of kielbasa, will you?

51:11.916 --> 51:13.543
Hiya, Roman.

51:21.525 --> 51:24.221
Do you know that my wife

51:24.262 --> 51:25.820
loves your sausage?

51:43.748 --> 51:45.648
We're fucked.

51:47.551 --> 51:50.281
Hardwood floors,
of course...

51:51.455 --> 51:53.150
with a view on three sides,

51:53.190 --> 51:55.624
five bedrooms,
three and a quarter baths,

51:55.660 --> 51:59.357
- marble fireplaces, walk-in closets--
- Dave.

51:59.397 --> 52:01.228
It was on the market
in '92.

52:01.265 --> 52:03.699
It went for a mil-five.

52:03.734 --> 52:06.794
Now it'd go
for six-- 6.5 easy.

52:06.837 --> 52:08.395
Why'd you call me?

52:09.840 --> 52:11.967
They're tearing it down.

52:12.009 --> 52:13.670
Some building inspector
with a bug up his ass

52:13.711 --> 52:15.576
did an earthquake
retrofit check.

52:15.613 --> 52:17.604
Apparently it's unsafe.

52:17.648 --> 52:20.344
And is it?

52:20.384 --> 52:22.944
- It's got hardwood floors.
- What does this have to do with me?

52:25.656 --> 52:26.987
I made a deal
with the owner.

52:27.024 --> 52:29.652
The city's paying him off,
but he's not getting

52:29.694 --> 52:32.390
the real value
of the property.

52:32.430 --> 52:35.524
The market is bullish, Frank.

52:37.335 --> 52:39.929
This is going to be worth

52:39.970 --> 52:43.701
maybe nine mil by
the end of next year.

52:43.741 --> 52:45.231
What's your deal, Dave?

52:45.276 --> 52:48.177
Well, if I could get
the city off his back

52:48.212 --> 52:51.409
he'll split the profits
with me when he sells.

52:51.449 --> 52:53.041
That's very
exciting for you.

52:53.084 --> 52:55.609
Yes, it is.

52:55.653 --> 52:59.111
And it could be very
exciting for all of us...

52:59.156 --> 53:01.681
as I thought there would be
an opportunity

53:01.726 --> 53:03.921
for you to...

53:03.961 --> 53:05.826
negotiate with the city.

53:08.132 --> 53:11.033
Frank, it'll
give you a chance

53:11.068 --> 53:13.036
to ease back into things.

53:13.070 --> 53:15.004
You're doing so great
with your recovery.

53:15.039 --> 53:16.973
- Forget it.
- Come on, Frank.

53:17.007 --> 53:19.601
- I've been more than courteous.
- You what?

53:19.643 --> 53:21.304
I got you your job,

53:21.345 --> 53:23.506
got you a nice place to live.
I didn't have to do that.

53:23.547 --> 53:25.708
I could have gotten
you a shitty walk-up in the Tenderloin

53:25.750 --> 53:27.513
or a studio
in the Castro.

53:27.551 --> 53:30.145
You'd be up to your
neck in dog collars and assless chaps

53:30.187 --> 53:31.916
if it wasn't for me.

53:31.956 --> 53:34.390
Not to mention
the cashew butter.

53:34.425 --> 53:36.518
And asking for help should
not be such a big production.

53:36.560 --> 53:38.494
Why are you walking
like that, anyway?

53:41.966 --> 53:44.958
Look, no shooting,
no stabbing.

53:45.002 --> 53:47.197
No violence at all
if you can help it.

53:47.238 --> 53:50.139
Just strong,
clear negotiation.

53:50.174 --> 53:53.610
- I'll let you know.
- I'd appreciate that.

53:54.945 --> 53:56.435
Lick-dick.

54:00.851 --> 54:02.751
Everybody laughs at the fat girl.

54:05.389 --> 54:08.085
But if I'm drunk,
I can't hear them.

54:12.029 --> 54:14.156
Maybe the drinking helps me
laugh at the fat girl too.

54:20.137 --> 54:21.934
Thanks, Becky.

54:21.972 --> 54:24.668
I know we're...

54:24.708 --> 54:27.074
not supposed to respond

54:27.111 --> 54:28.806
directly to each
other's stories,

54:28.846 --> 54:32.407
but I was hoping I could
say something to Becky.

54:34.018 --> 54:36.543
Is that all right?

54:36.587 --> 54:38.384
Yeah.
Yeah, go ahead.

54:40.658 --> 54:44.116
Becky, I think I might
know how you feel.

54:45.596 --> 54:47.928
Life for me has pretty
much been a pain in the ass.

54:49.400 --> 54:52.096
And I always thought that
was reason enough to drink.

54:53.237 --> 54:55.330
I mean, sure,
now and then,

54:55.372 --> 54:58.102
I'd kill somebody
and I'd cash a check,

54:58.142 --> 55:00.736
and that made me
feel good, but...

55:02.346 --> 55:04.507
I'd just use the money
to drink more.

55:05.549 --> 55:07.176
You know?

55:08.652 --> 55:10.483
I don't like me either.

55:16.126 --> 55:18.686
Be thankful
that something in you

55:18.729 --> 55:22.290
had the courage to say
"Enough.

55:22.333 --> 55:24.893
I'm not the worst
fat girl in the world."

55:28.906 --> 55:32.000
Uh, thanks, Frank.

55:32.042 --> 55:34.272
No problem.

55:38.015 --> 55:40.745
Up next is, uh...

55:40.784 --> 55:42.911

You should call Dave.

56:59.263 --> 57:01.231
I don't know.

57:02.366 --> 57:04.698
I know you're nervous,

57:04.735 --> 57:06.760
but you're doing so well.

57:08.038 --> 57:10.336
You've got real talent

57:10.374 --> 57:12.399
and a real opportunity here.

57:12.443 --> 57:14.001
I won't let you waste it.

57:17.514 --> 57:20.642
Now, get out there and threaten to kill
that city supervisor.

57:43.974 --> 57:46.966
- Do we have an appointment?
- I just want to grab you for a moment.

57:47.011 --> 57:50.344
- Really?
- Just to talk.

57:50.381 --> 57:52.849
I assume there's a reason
I'm not calling security?

57:52.883 --> 57:54.373
Why aren't you?

57:55.886 --> 57:57.717
I don't know.

57:57.755 --> 58:00.315
As disturbed as I am
to find a man

58:00.357 --> 58:02.222
in his underwear
in my private office...

58:03.894 --> 58:05.589
I don't exactly feel
like I'm in danger.

58:05.629 --> 58:07.563
There you go.

58:07.598 --> 58:09.793
Supervisor Davis,
the reason I came to you like this

58:09.833 --> 58:12.063
is precisely so you
wouldn't feel threatened.

58:13.404 --> 58:15.668
Do you mind if I sit?

58:15.706 --> 58:18.903
So, why would
I feel threatened?

58:18.942 --> 58:20.842
- Are you planning on threatening me?
- Far from it.

58:20.878 --> 58:23.176
I'm here today as a harmless
but concerned taxpayer.

58:23.213 --> 58:25.181
I'm aware your
time is short,

58:25.215 --> 58:28.150
so I'll just quickly address
my three main points.

58:28.185 --> 58:30.210
One, what I'm proposing
would allow a historic building

58:30.254 --> 58:32.484
to be preserved
for generations to come.

58:32.523 --> 58:35.321
Two, this project would
enhance your reputation

58:35.359 --> 58:36.485
as a sympathetic
civic leader.

58:36.527 --> 58:38.859
- Security, please.
- Three, I have a gun.

58:43.634 --> 58:45.465
Now I feel threatened.

58:52.976 --> 58:55.001
Hey, what do you say,
Rosemary?

58:55.045 --> 58:57.479
- Oh, hi, Stef.
- Hi.

58:57.514 --> 59:00.039
I'm sorry, I, uh...

59:00.084 --> 59:01.312
We already made our bets.

59:01.351 --> 59:03.751
Hey, Czyprynski.

59:03.787 --> 59:05.414
Here to get a bet in?

59:05.456 --> 59:07.754
Hey, look.
Irish guys in a bar.

59:25.442 --> 59:28.377
Your time's up already.
O'Leary wants you gone.

59:31.115 --> 59:33.174
Stupid Polack.

59:36.587 --> 59:39.181
Then he said,
"That house?

59:39.223 --> 59:42.351
That house sounds
perfectly safe to me."

59:42.392 --> 59:43.689
And that was that.

59:43.727 --> 59:45.592
L-- I put on my clothes
and I went home.

59:51.602 --> 59:55.231
Here's to granting others
the serenity to change

59:55.272 --> 59:57.604
the things
you cannot accept.

59:57.641 --> 01:00:01.600
And the courage to accept large amounts
of change serenely.

01:00:01.645 --> 01:00:03.340
And the wisdom
to know the difference.

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.405
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

01:00:08.819 --> 01:00:10.548
You did this sober, Frank.

01:00:10.587 --> 01:00:12.555
Did a really good job.
I'm proud of you.

01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:14.989
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:00:17.127 --> 01:00:19.721
Now all you have to do is keep it up
for the rest of your life.

01:00:23.567 --> 01:00:26.092
So, how's it
going with her?

01:00:26.136 --> 01:00:29.037
- She's still here.
- Yeah.

01:00:29.072 --> 01:00:31.563
Well, it's getting late.
If I'm not on the bridge by 11:00,

01:00:31.608 --> 01:00:33.667
got to work
the truck lane, so...

01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:35.769
Can I, uh,
catch a ride with you?

01:00:35.813 --> 01:00:38.213
Sure. Just got to
use the bathroom.

01:00:39.583 --> 01:00:41.676
You're not staying?

01:00:41.718 --> 01:00:43.151
L-- I don't think I should.

01:00:43.187 --> 01:00:46.554
L-- it's not because
I disapprove

01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:48.581
of what you did today.

01:00:48.625 --> 01:00:50.354
But you don't approve
so much you want to stay.

01:00:50.394 --> 01:00:53.557
Oh, I want to stay.

01:00:53.597 --> 01:00:56.088
It's just I've kind of
been accused

01:00:56.133 --> 01:00:57.691
in the past of losing
my boundaries.

01:00:57.734 --> 01:00:59.497
Which boundaries are those?

01:00:59.536 --> 01:01:01.163
You name 'em,
I've lost 'em.

01:01:01.205 --> 01:01:03.332
Remember the word "no"
means nothing to me.

01:01:03.373 --> 01:01:05.170
Am I saying no?

01:01:09.146 --> 01:01:11.842
You're getting better,
Frank.

01:01:11.882 --> 01:01:14.578
I need to make sure
I am too.

01:01:14.618 --> 01:01:16.848
Baby, I know
what you mean.

01:01:16.887 --> 01:01:18.946
Well, all right.

01:01:20.457 --> 01:01:22.516
Thanks, Frank.
See you later.

01:01:22.559 --> 01:01:24.720
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:01:49.086 --> 01:01:52.613
- Hi, Doris.
- Oh, Jeez-- son of a bitch!

01:01:52.656 --> 01:01:54.180
What the hell
are you doing?

01:01:54.224 --> 01:01:56.419
Working on being alone.

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:58.291
Well, work on it
someplace else.

01:01:58.328 --> 01:02:00.728
Supposed to be
a part-time job.

01:02:00.764 --> 01:02:02.664
Come here.

01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:22.111
If I'm gonna be
working this late,

01:02:22.152 --> 01:02:25.610
he's not the only
one getting embalmed.

01:02:25.656 --> 01:02:27.385
This is it, isn't it?

01:02:27.424 --> 01:02:29.255
What is?

01:02:29.293 --> 01:02:32.057
No matter what you do,
you know, no matter how good you are

01:02:32.095 --> 01:02:33.995
you die.

01:02:35.532 --> 01:02:37.557
Then there's
nobody else around.

01:02:37.601 --> 01:02:39.091
Well, he's not
exactly gonna be

01:02:39.136 --> 01:02:40.797
washing himself,
now is he?

01:02:43.974 --> 01:02:45.669
Hey, get the hell
out of here.

01:02:45.709 --> 01:02:47.540
I don't need you
getting all freaky on me

01:02:47.577 --> 01:02:49.101
- in the middle of the night.
- Sorry.

01:02:49.146 --> 01:02:51.774
Just go be alone
with somebody else.

01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:08.657
- Hey, thanks for the drinks.
- No worries, man.

01:03:08.699 --> 01:03:10.564
Feel like
getting one more?

01:03:30.821 --> 01:03:32.379
It's Roman.

01:03:41.131 --> 01:03:42.826
How'd it go?

01:03:42.866 --> 01:03:44.663
I talked to Spiros
and his brother.

01:03:44.701 --> 01:03:48.193
They said if they wanted to back a
losing team, they'd buy the Sabres.

01:03:48.238 --> 01:03:51.366
- Fucking Greeks.
- Hey, they gave us democracy.

01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:54.973
You're gonna ruin
your eyes in this light.

01:03:57.481 --> 01:03:58.812
Stef.

01:04:01.284 --> 01:04:04.310
We're gonna come out
on the other side of this.

01:04:04.354 --> 01:04:06.447
I'm gonna fix it.

01:04:07.924 --> 01:04:10.552
Okay?

01:04:10.594 --> 01:04:13.529
Money's no good here!
I'm the King of Nob Hill!

01:04:15.065 --> 01:04:17.499
And half of North Beach!

01:04:17.534 --> 01:04:19.968
How did that happen?

01:04:22.739 --> 01:04:26.266
Mmm. Mmm.

01:04:38.622 --> 01:04:40.590
What do you say, Franklin?

01:04:42.025 --> 01:04:43.583
Uh, another one
down here, hmm.

01:04:49.499 --> 01:04:52.263
You did me a huge
favor today, Frank.

01:04:58.141 --> 01:05:00.871
Maybe you ought to
come hang with us.

01:05:00.911 --> 01:05:02.811
You know, meet some
of the guys and--

01:05:02.846 --> 01:05:04.473
You need to shut up now.

01:05:07.017 --> 01:05:08.484
Yeah.

01:05:08.518 --> 01:05:11.112
You know--
you know, you're...

01:05:11.154 --> 01:05:13.054
a loser, Frank.

01:05:14.257 --> 01:05:15.849
It-- it's just--

01:05:15.892 --> 01:05:19.953
what's it like to have absolutely
no self-control, hmm?

01:05:19.996 --> 01:05:22.658
In real estate,
you learn to expect

01:05:22.699 --> 01:05:24.997
a certain amount
of natural resistance.

01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:29.065
That's the part I like--

01:05:29.106 --> 01:05:31.267
breaking their wills.

01:05:32.442 --> 01:05:34.273
But with you,
what did it take?

01:05:36.146 --> 01:05:37.613
Me asking.

01:05:37.647 --> 01:05:39.740
You do what
you're told, Frank.

01:05:39.783 --> 01:05:41.910
You're a victim.
You let people fuck you.

01:05:41.952 --> 01:05:44.443
I'm gonna drink
this drink.

01:05:44.488 --> 01:05:46.012
And when I'm finished,

01:05:46.056 --> 01:05:48.115
do not be in this bar.

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.355
Oh.

01:05:52.395 --> 01:05:55.592
You're not the only guy
in town with a gun, Frank.

01:05:55.632 --> 01:05:57.657
Hey.

01:05:58.969 --> 01:06:00.459
Keep 'em coming.

01:06:07.677 --> 01:06:10.202
- You got any food?
- Check the fridge.

01:06:10.247 --> 01:06:12.340
Pam made a whole
thing of golumpki.

01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:15.880
Henry, go get some food!

01:06:37.607 --> 01:06:39.598
Hello?

01:06:47.517 --> 01:06:49.917
It's him.

01:06:55.458 --> 01:06:57.824
- Yeah.
- Hey hey, Roman, it's me.

01:06:57.861 --> 01:07:00.022
L-- I just thought
I'd call and say good night.

01:07:02.532 --> 01:07:04.159
Yeah.

01:07:04.201 --> 01:07:05.691
Good night.

01:07:18.148 --> 01:07:19.581
All right. Stanley,
get the front door.

01:07:19.616 --> 01:07:21.584
Stef, get the back.

01:07:37.634 --> 01:07:39.226
It's Henry.

01:07:41.204 --> 01:07:42.831
Henry's got a key.

01:07:50.847 --> 01:07:52.508
Come on in, Henry!

01:08:01.191 --> 01:08:02.681
Move.

01:08:16.006 --> 01:08:17.268
Here, I'll get this.

01:08:17.307 --> 01:08:19.901
Give me the shotgun.
Give it to me!

01:08:19.943 --> 01:08:22.069
You take this.
Check the basement.

01:08:32.555 --> 01:08:34.318
- What was that?
- Nothing.

01:08:35.625 --> 01:08:37.354
I'm coming.

01:09:01.451 --> 01:09:03.975
All right.
Let 'em in.

01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:39.950
You know, Roman,

01:09:39.988 --> 01:09:41.684
you could have
still plowed.

01:10:34.911 --> 01:10:36.708
Shit.

01:10:59.636 --> 01:11:01.103
Hello.

01:11:01.137 --> 01:11:03.264
They're all dead.

01:11:03.306 --> 01:11:06.571
- Stef?
- O'Leary shot Roman

01:11:06.609 --> 01:11:08.543
in my front hallway.

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.907
Couldn't even
shoot him standing up

01:11:11.948 --> 01:11:13.506
like a regular guy.

01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:16.348
Stef, wait.
Go slower.

01:11:16.386 --> 01:11:17.614
He hit me
over the head

01:11:17.654 --> 01:11:19.554
to protect me and--

01:11:20.657 --> 01:11:22.181
You want me
to come get you?

01:11:22.225 --> 01:11:23.852
No.

01:11:25.795 --> 01:11:28.320
Stay out there.

01:11:28.364 --> 01:11:29.888
Live your life.

01:11:29.933 --> 01:11:31.730
It's my fault, I--

01:11:31.768 --> 01:11:33.395
I should have
killed O'Leary.

01:11:37.507 --> 01:11:40.135
You're a loser, Frank.

01:11:42.111 --> 01:11:44.636
I can't trust you anymore, Frank!

01:11:48.318 --> 01:11:49.876
The alcoholic's God

01:11:49.919 --> 01:11:51.750
is a very
forgiving God, Frank.

01:11:56.593 --> 01:11:59.061
God!

01:12:00.396 --> 01:12:02.421
I could really
use a hand right now!

01:12:09.205 --> 01:12:10.866
You do what you're told, Frank.

01:12:10.907 --> 01:12:13.774
You're a victim.
You let people fuck you.

01:12:25.522 --> 01:12:28.855
Hi, you've reached Laurel.
Leave a message at the beep.

01:12:30.393 --> 01:12:33.829
Laurel, hi.
You're sleeping.

01:12:33.863 --> 01:12:35.660
I guess that's
just as well.

01:12:35.698 --> 01:12:37.689
There's no way
to tell you this

01:12:37.734 --> 01:12:39.258
that isn't gonna make me
sound like an asshole,

01:12:39.302 --> 01:12:42.237
but I'm leaving
for the airport

01:12:42.272 --> 01:12:44.172
and I probably
won't come back.

01:12:45.441 --> 01:12:47.534
I would have just hurt you.
Forget me.

01:12:47.577 --> 01:12:49.477
I'm a joke.

01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:53.005
Find somebody better.

01:12:53.049 --> 01:12:54.812
There'll be
other funerals.

01:12:56.019 --> 01:12:57.611
I'm sorry.

01:13:08.031 --> 01:13:10.898
So, uh, gonna find a meeting
when you get there?

01:13:10.934 --> 01:13:12.458
- Cross my heart.
- Okay.

01:13:12.502 --> 01:13:14.231
Oh.

01:13:15.505 --> 01:13:17.200
This isn't the place
for this, Frank.

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:19.435
I can't exactly
take it onboard with me.

01:13:19.475 --> 01:13:20.965
What am I supposed
to do with it?

01:13:21.010 --> 01:13:23.205
Kill bad guys.

01:13:24.314 --> 01:13:26.748
Crack walnuts.
I don't care.

01:13:26.783 --> 01:13:28.375
You were kind to me.

01:13:28.418 --> 01:13:30.010
I want you to have it.

01:13:30.053 --> 01:13:32.920
Thank you. I'll think of you
when I shoot something.

01:13:40.096 --> 01:13:42.462
Frank. What the fuck?

01:13:43.866 --> 01:13:45.595
What the fuck
are you thinking?

01:13:45.635 --> 01:13:47.296
What are you doing here?

01:13:47.337 --> 01:13:48.929
Not letting you
get away with it.

01:13:48.972 --> 01:13:51.065
- With what?
- With being a pussy, Frank.

01:13:51.107 --> 01:13:52.938
I told you, I'm not
any good for you.

01:13:54.277 --> 01:13:56.370
Don't you think I have
anything to say about that?

01:13:59.048 --> 01:14:01.243
I'm not helpless, Frank.

01:14:01.284 --> 01:14:03.479
If I'm getting screwed over,
I'm really quite capable

01:14:03.519 --> 01:14:06.386
of figuring it out for myself.
And the only screwing over

01:14:06.422 --> 01:14:08.219
that I've gotten
from you so far

01:14:08.257 --> 01:14:10.487
is that bullshit message
that you left on my machine.

01:14:10.526 --> 01:14:12.187
Laurel, I'm a drunk
and a killer.

01:14:12.228 --> 01:14:13.991
And I still
want to be with you.

01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:15.725
Doesn't that spell
anything out for you, Frank?

01:14:15.765 --> 01:14:17.528
I know what has to happen.
You can't be a part of it.

01:14:17.567 --> 01:14:19.694
Haven't you learned anything
in that stupid program?

01:14:19.736 --> 01:14:21.203
You don't know
what has to happen.

01:14:21.237 --> 01:14:23.535
You don't know shit
about how to run your life.

01:14:23.573 --> 01:14:26.007
It's not that simple.
I saw you last night.

01:14:26.042 --> 01:14:28.567
Well, fuck my boundaries.

01:14:28.611 --> 01:14:31.136
You know, I wanted
to see you so I came.

01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:33.774
I almost killed you.

01:14:33.816 --> 01:14:36.876
I pointed my gun
right at your head

01:14:36.919 --> 01:14:39.251
and I almost killed you.

01:14:39.288 --> 01:14:40.983
You were gonna
shoot me, Frank?

01:14:41.024 --> 01:14:42.651
Somebody!

01:14:42.692 --> 01:14:44.216
It turned out to be you.

01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:45.887
I was drunk.

01:14:49.832 --> 01:14:51.823
Don't do this, Frank.

01:14:54.037 --> 01:14:55.527
Sorry.

01:15:02.445 --> 01:15:04.208
Hold on.

01:15:04.247 --> 01:15:06.340
Boarding pass?

01:15:07.917 --> 01:15:11.512
Ma'am? I can't let you through
without a boarding pass.

01:15:11.554 --> 01:15:14.523
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Ma'am.

01:15:14.557 --> 01:15:17.526
Do I really look like I want to go
to fucking Buffalo?

01:16:35.037 --> 01:16:36.595
Boo.

01:16:38.875 --> 01:16:41.343
I used your toothpaste.

01:16:43.079 --> 01:16:46.344
The Chinese think O'Leary's a genius.

01:16:46.382 --> 01:16:49.112
He's brought three legitimate
businesses with their money

01:16:49.152 --> 01:16:50.915
in addition to taking
all our stuff.

01:16:50.953 --> 01:16:54.184
It-- it's like
we don't exist anymore.

01:16:55.825 --> 01:16:57.486
We don't.

01:16:59.629 --> 01:17:01.961
They have one last meeting--

01:17:01.998 --> 01:17:04.831
money, routes, shares,

01:17:04.867 --> 01:17:06.767
some serious
business talk.

01:17:09.739 --> 01:17:12.105
It's tomorrow.

01:17:16.245 --> 01:17:18.475
One day at a time.

01:17:22.051 --> 01:17:23.643
Did you find one?

01:17:23.686 --> 01:17:27.247
"Living Sober,"
8:00 Labor Hall.

01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:28.814
You want me to go with you?

01:17:28.858 --> 01:17:30.587
Not to that meeting.

01:17:32.995 --> 01:17:35.088
Not to the other one,
either.

01:18:09.465 --> 01:18:11.399
Ray, how you doing?

01:18:11.434 --> 01:18:14.426
Looking good, buddy.
Looking good.

01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:16.631
Jim, haven't seen you
for a couple of weeks.

01:18:17.874 --> 01:18:20.206
He's going to a meeting.
He's a drunk.

01:18:20.243 --> 01:18:21.870
Put two in his head.

01:18:21.911 --> 01:18:23.572
Got it.

01:19:12.528 --> 01:19:15.156
- Earl, alcoholic.
- Hey, Earl.

01:19:15.197 --> 01:19:16.664
Hi, Earl.

01:19:16.699 --> 01:19:18.894
I see some new faces
here this morning.

01:19:18.935 --> 01:19:20.527
Let me go over
some ground rules.

01:19:20.569 --> 01:19:23.333
We meet early
and we break early.

01:19:23.372 --> 01:19:25.203
We don't have
guest speakers

01:19:25.241 --> 01:19:27.675
and we don't
have time for rambling.

01:19:27.710 --> 01:19:30.770
We're here so everybody
gets to speak his mind,

01:19:30.813 --> 01:19:32.906
have a doughnut
and get on with his day.

01:20:01.711 --> 01:20:03.201
Stay there!

01:20:03.245 --> 01:20:04.712
Get your hands up!

01:20:04.747 --> 01:20:06.942
Don't move!
What are you doing?

01:20:06.983 --> 01:20:09.178
I can't--
I can't breathe!

01:20:09.218 --> 01:20:11.379
I can't breathe.

01:20:13.522 --> 01:20:16.218
I'm Ray and I'm
an alcoholic.

01:20:16.258 --> 01:20:18.123
- Hey, Ray.
- Hi, Ray.

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:20.526
Pretty big day for me.

01:20:20.563 --> 01:20:23.054
It's Sherry
and my anniversary.

01:20:24.734 --> 01:20:26.224
20 years.

01:20:35.177 --> 01:20:37.042
Well, I-- I--
I guess you could say

01:20:37.079 --> 01:20:38.876
I put her through a lot.

01:20:40.216 --> 01:20:41.843
She's been really great.

01:20:41.884 --> 01:20:44.785
Hey, could somebody
get the curtains there?

01:21:01.203 --> 01:21:02.500
Shit.

01:21:02.538 --> 01:21:05.268
- Thanks.
- No problem.

01:21:05.307 --> 01:21:07.969
I know you think
you know Frank pretty well,

01:21:08.010 --> 01:21:10.604
but there's probably a few things
you're not gonna want to hear.

01:21:10.646 --> 01:21:13.740
Like that he came back
to Buffalo to kill Edward O'Leary

01:21:13.783 --> 01:21:15.808
so he could stop him
and the rest of the Irish

01:21:15.851 --> 01:21:18.046
from getting into bed
with some Chinese sugar daddy

01:21:18.087 --> 01:21:20.783
and wiping your
family off the map?

01:21:20.823 --> 01:21:22.552
Oh, and he's
a really big drunk.

01:21:25.628 --> 01:21:27.220
Wow.

01:21:27.263 --> 01:21:28.890
He's really opening up.

01:21:39.475 --> 01:21:43.036
Well, uh, I guess that's about it then.

01:21:43.079 --> 01:21:46.207
Unless, uh,
any of our new faces

01:21:46.248 --> 01:21:47.772
would like
to say something.

01:21:47.817 --> 01:21:49.944
Come on up.

01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:00.260
My name's Frank
and I'm an alcoholic.

01:22:00.296 --> 01:22:02.355
Hi, Frank.

01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:06.830
I just moved back
after a few months away

01:22:06.869 --> 01:22:08.837
sorting out my life,
that type of thing.

01:22:08.871 --> 01:22:10.498
I've had
a rough time recently.

01:22:11.807 --> 01:22:14.674
I don't know if...

01:22:14.710 --> 01:22:16.302
coming home
is a good idea or not.

01:22:16.345 --> 01:22:18.939
But...

01:22:18.981 --> 01:22:21.677
my work
is here in Buffalo.

01:22:21.717 --> 01:22:23.480
I'm needed.

01:22:24.854 --> 01:22:26.947
That part's easy to figure.
I can focus on that.

01:22:26.989 --> 01:22:29.321
But the other part,
my life, I don't know.

01:22:31.293 --> 01:22:32.851
It's hard here.

01:22:34.196 --> 01:22:36.255
I'm not the same guy
who learned to be a drunk

01:22:36.298 --> 01:22:37.822
in my parents' garage.

01:22:37.867 --> 01:22:40.665
L-- I don't see myself
the same way.

01:22:40.703 --> 01:22:43.399
I know now that I have

01:22:43.439 --> 01:22:46.738
people I care about,
a person I care about.

01:22:49.678 --> 01:22:51.236
Hi.

01:22:54.183 --> 01:22:56.208
Hey.

01:22:56.252 --> 01:22:58.880
I have a person I want
to have care about me.

01:23:00.756 --> 01:23:02.485
I can't run away
from that.

01:23:03.526 --> 01:23:05.084
She won't let me.

01:23:07.463 --> 01:23:09.863
I guess...

01:23:09.899 --> 01:23:12.993
what I'm saying is,
Laurel...

01:23:13.035 --> 01:23:16.163
I love you.

01:23:16.205 --> 01:23:19.538
I'm ready to spend my life
with you, whatever happens.

01:23:22.378 --> 01:23:24.608
I love you too, Frank!

01:23:36.825 --> 01:23:39.953
- It looks like James is here.
- I hope he turned up the heat.

01:23:59.215 --> 01:24:01.376
Come on.

01:24:06.222 --> 01:24:07.746
Can I get you
a drink, Frank?

01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:09.485
No, thanks.

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:12.650
Nuh!

01:24:15.397 --> 01:24:16.887
Get in.

01:24:18.968 --> 01:24:20.492
Now.

01:24:29.345 --> 01:24:32.314
- Here to kill me, are you?
- Yes.

01:24:34.016 --> 01:24:36.246
Well, then you won't mind
if I get myself a drink.

01:24:38.954 --> 01:24:41.013
You know, a guy
like me, Frankie,

01:24:41.056 --> 01:24:43.183
I can't drink
out of the bottle.

01:24:48.163 --> 01:24:50.154
You could pull an army tank
out from behind there...

01:24:51.533 --> 01:24:53.000
I'd still kill you.

01:25:06.048 --> 01:25:07.208
Ahhh.

01:25:10.152 --> 01:25:12.814
- You know I got friends coming.
- Come out from around there.

01:25:22.898 --> 01:25:24.365
Are you good at your job,
Frankie boy?

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.698
Didn't used to be.

01:25:26.735 --> 01:25:28.566
Well, how about now?

01:25:44.987 --> 01:25:46.784
Don't kill me, Frank, okay?

01:25:46.822 --> 01:25:48.790
Don't kill me.

01:25:54.463 --> 01:25:57.193
Well, it was worth a try.

01:25:57.232 --> 01:25:59.666
You should think about getting
yourself into a program.

01:26:09.945 --> 01:26:13.176
Well, I guess that--

01:27:09.705 --> 01:27:12.173
Anybody here with one week?

01:27:13.909 --> 01:27:15.638
One month?

01:27:16.945 --> 01:27:18.572
Six months?

01:27:21.116 --> 01:27:23.141
One year?

01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:27.248
Anybody celebrating one year?

01:28:07.529 --> 01:28:10.327
My name's Frank
and I'm an alcoholic.

01:28:10.365 --> 01:28:11.923
