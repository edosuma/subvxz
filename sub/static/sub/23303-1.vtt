02:01.587 --> 02:02.886
yes!

02:27.246 --> 02:29.478
Believe it or not,
anyone can be famous,

02:29.480 --> 02:31.847
and you don't really need
god-given ability to do it,

02:31.849 --> 02:33.716
but that doesn't mean
you go out there

02:33.718 --> 02:35.418
and shoot up
a crowded movie theater.

02:35.420 --> 02:37.221
That's just wrong,
but if you're motivated,

02:37.223 --> 02:39.256
you can get yourself
on a reality TV show,

02:39.258 --> 02:40.891
or jump cars on a motorcycle

02:40.893 --> 02:42.491
or... or marry a movie star

02:42.493 --> 02:43.693
or simply find a wife

02:43.695 --> 02:45.362
willing to have 20 kids.

02:45.364 --> 02:47.397
As for myself,
my best shot at the limelight

02:47.399 --> 02:48.965
is to buddy up
to the president.

02:48.967 --> 02:51.203
I just need the attention
of the media first.

02:52.770 --> 02:55.805
So you jumped
the camp David fence

02:55.807 --> 02:57.477
to be on the 11:00 news?

02:58.811 --> 03:00.876
Yeah, it's pretty inventive,
huh?

03:03.514 --> 03:05.816
Hey, where's
all the TV cameras?

03:05.818 --> 03:08.484
- TV cameras?
- And reporters.

03:08.486 --> 03:10.887
I thought I'd be doing
a bunch of interviews by now.

03:10.889 --> 03:14.458
- I gotta get out of here.
- There's no interviews,

03:14.460 --> 03:15.461
Mr. Marcus.

03:17.528 --> 03:19.632
There's no reporters
or cameras either.

03:21.633 --> 03:22.834
It's just us.

03:24.603 --> 03:25.735
Just us?

03:25.737 --> 03:27.306
Why don't you have a seat?

03:36.914 --> 03:39.048
I don't get it.

03:39.050 --> 03:40.983
This is supposed to be
big news.

03:40.985 --> 03:43.620
People... people jump the white
house fence all the time.

03:43.622 --> 03:47.024
I don't think camp David
has the same impact.

03:47.026 --> 03:48.424
I understand the president

03:48.426 --> 03:51.695
- wasn't even there at the time.
- Really?

03:51.697 --> 03:54.564
Mr. Marcus, can you identify
the precise point

03:54.566 --> 03:56.433
when your preoccupation
to be famous

03:56.435 --> 03:58.869
- initially manifested?
- Excuse me?

03:58.871 --> 04:02.506
When did you first try
to become famous?

04:02.508 --> 04:03.509
First time?

04:05.510 --> 04:07.511
That's easy.

04:07.513 --> 04:09.983
I have some really
bad news for you, Thomas.

04:11.917 --> 04:14.887
Your dog was hit by a car.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.454
He died.

04:18.456 --> 04:20.627
I'm so, so, sorry.

04:22.093 --> 04:25.562
No, Rex? Not my Rex.

04:25.564 --> 04:28.968
No, Rex. Please.

04:31.470 --> 04:32.769
Did you teach him
that voice?

04:32.771 --> 04:34.337
He can...

04:34.339 --> 04:36.673
- That's it?
- Yeah, more than enough.

04:36.675 --> 04:39.642
How do you expect a young boy to
cry without proper motivation?

04:39.644 --> 04:40.979
Blah, blah, blah, next!

04:41.980 --> 04:43.850
Take a seat.

04:44.949 --> 04:47.851
Tyler, welcome.

04:47.853 --> 04:51.454
Tyler.

04:51.456 --> 04:52.625
No, Rex.

04:55.494 --> 04:56.996
Not my Rex.

04:58.029 --> 05:00.764
No...

05:00.766 --> 05:02.531
Rex, please!

05:02.533 --> 05:04.868
You can stop.
That was...

05:04.870 --> 05:06.803
That was amazing.
I actually felt something.

05:06.805 --> 05:09.042
- Oh, my god.
- You're fantastic, Tyler.

05:10.641 --> 05:11.774
And that's how it's done.

05:11.776 --> 05:14.043
Yeah, thank you.

05:14.045 --> 05:15.812
Exit that way.

05:15.814 --> 05:19.949
Always difficult when fantasy
and reality intersect.

05:19.951 --> 05:21.685
Yeah.

05:21.687 --> 05:23.086
After I squashed
my mom's dreams,

05:23.088 --> 05:24.590
it was my dad's turn.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.461
Get a little arc in there.

05:30.428 --> 05:32.596
- Now, pay attention.
- Okay.

05:34.533 --> 05:35.867
Just keep going.
Keep going.

05:43.675 --> 05:45.742
Did your dad
give up after that?

05:45.744 --> 05:47.010
Not yet.

05:47.012 --> 05:48.644
He was determined
to get my face

05:48.646 --> 05:50.079
on a box of wheaties.

05:50.081 --> 05:52.182
If I was going to make
a name for myself,

05:52.184 --> 05:54.017
I was going to have to do it
on my own.

05:56.588 --> 05:58.591
Go! go! Go!
Go, go!

06:11.202 --> 06:12.569
Winner!

06:19.978 --> 06:22.012
You know, Mr. Marcus.

06:22.014 --> 06:24.815
If someone has aspirations
to be famous,

06:24.817 --> 06:27.784
it's usually a prerequisite
that the individual have

06:27.786 --> 06:31.587
some sort of
exceptional talent or skill.

06:31.589 --> 06:33.589
- Wouldn't you agree?
- Can I borrow your cell phone?

06:33.591 --> 06:36.526
There must be a pic of me at
camp David going viral by now.

06:36.528 --> 06:38.195
Based on your failed attempts,

06:38.197 --> 06:39.695
don't you think it's time

06:39.697 --> 06:41.096
you focused
on more attainable goals?

06:41.098 --> 06:42.899
This is not fair.

06:42.901 --> 06:45.168
What about the couple that
crashed the white house dinner?

06:45.170 --> 06:46.735
They were all over the news,

06:46.737 --> 06:48.003
and they weren't even
charged with a crime,

06:48.005 --> 06:50.139
so why am I here?

06:50.141 --> 06:55.911
Mr. Marcus, only .001% of us
will ever truly be famous.

06:55.913 --> 06:58.682
With those odds, I think
it's in your best interest

06:58.684 --> 07:00.683
if you embraced
a normal lifestyle

07:00.685 --> 07:03.786
like 99.99% of the population.

07:03.788 --> 07:05.055
Can I have a newspaper?

07:05.057 --> 07:07.059
There's gotta be
an article about me.

07:12.064 --> 07:15.966
Listen.
i went through your file.

07:15.968 --> 07:17.834
You never finished college.

07:17.836 --> 07:19.935
You drifted from job to job,

07:19.937 --> 07:21.704
no significant other,
no close friends.

07:21.706 --> 07:23.740
I understand you don't even
talk to your parents.

07:23.742 --> 07:25.207
We're wasting time.

07:25.209 --> 07:27.577
I need to strike
while the iron is hot.

07:27.579 --> 07:29.245
Maybe you don't understand
this concept. All right?

07:29.247 --> 07:31.281
Can I please get the number
of the publicist

07:31.283 --> 07:32.615
that I left
in my coat pocket?

07:32.617 --> 07:34.750
- Can you do that for me?
- Mr. Marcus,

07:34.752 --> 07:37.086
if you don't overcome this unrealistic
obsession, a well-adjusted...

07:37.088 --> 07:39.555
What do you want from me?
Huh?

07:39.557 --> 07:42.858
What do you want? You want me to say
that I'll be an average nobody?

07:42.860 --> 07:44.226
- Is that what you want?
- Just calm down...

07:44.228 --> 07:45.562
An average nobody
with an average life

07:45.564 --> 07:46.796
doing average things?

07:46.798 --> 07:47.930
Well, it's not an option!

07:47.932 --> 07:50.267
I cannot be part
of the 99.99%.

07:50.269 --> 07:52.735
I have to be famous!
Don't you understand?

07:52.737 --> 07:55.872
- That's what I'm meant to be.
- Mr. Marcus, you need to calm yourself down.

07:55.874 --> 07:58.541
So if it's not gonna happen,
why don't we just end it?

07:58.543 --> 08:00.010
Why don't we just end it,
okay?

08:00.012 --> 08:02.144
You don't even know what
the fuck I'm going through.

08:02.146 --> 08:04.848
- Let it out for me.
- I don't know why, but I still gotta try.

08:04.850 --> 08:06.082
Why don't I just end it?

08:06.084 --> 08:07.584
- Guards!
- you wanna see me end it?

08:07.586 --> 08:08.584
- Guards!
- I'll do it.

08:08.586 --> 08:09.752
I'll do it.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.755
Get your hands off me!

08:12.757 --> 08:14.723
You can't...

08:14.725 --> 08:17.627
Stop pushing around.

08:17.629 --> 08:19.628
Everybody stop pushing
me around.

08:55.933 --> 08:57.202
You're doing it wrong.

08:58.336 --> 08:59.935
Excuse me?

08:59.937 --> 09:01.304
I said,
"you're doing it wrong."

09:01.306 --> 09:02.839
You need
a sharp vertical cut

09:02.841 --> 09:04.110
instead of a puncture motion.

09:06.043 --> 09:07.344
Hey, look...
What are you doing?

09:07.346 --> 09:08.945
I'm helping you.

09:08.947 --> 09:11.714
Jeez, you could show
a little gratitude.

09:11.716 --> 09:13.182
- Gratitude?
- uh, yeah.

09:13.184 --> 09:15.352
Your way was going to be
quite messy,

09:15.354 --> 09:17.621
not to mention pretty painful.

09:17.623 --> 09:19.855
You don't want to go out
like that, do you?

09:19.857 --> 09:21.257
How do you know?

09:22.827 --> 09:25.228
I've had a lot of practice.

09:25.230 --> 09:27.832
Three failed attempts,
to be exact.

09:29.967 --> 09:32.201
What are you guys doing?

09:32.203 --> 09:34.704
I'm Hannah renner,
by the way.

09:34.706 --> 09:36.772
Uh, Bob.

09:36.774 --> 09:39.275
You're a palindrome?

09:39.277 --> 09:40.780
Talk about Karma.

09:43.315 --> 09:45.147
My name's actu...

09:45.149 --> 09:46.718
Actually Robert.

10:36.268 --> 10:40.036
Looks like we got
a little suicide watch, huh?

10:40.038 --> 10:43.305
Let me guess. You fucked
a goat at a petting zoo.

10:43.307 --> 10:44.744
No?

10:47.144 --> 10:49.179
Maybe you took a piss
in a bathroom sink

10:49.181 --> 10:50.716
at a 5-star restaurant?

10:52.451 --> 10:55.285
Oh.

10:55.287 --> 10:57.954
You're one of
those conventional types.

10:57.956 --> 11:00.456
Yeah, you probably looked
in the mirror

11:00.458 --> 11:03.158
and decided that chugging
a whole bottle of sleeping pills

11:03.160 --> 11:04.896
was the best option, right?

11:07.164 --> 11:08.498
I... I just wanna be famous.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.366
Famous?

11:10.368 --> 11:12.835
Well, you're in good company,

11:12.837 --> 11:14.807
real good company.

11:15.974 --> 11:18.474
Shake hands...
Ha ha ha...

11:18.476 --> 11:22.411
With popular TV personality
and world renowned psychologist,

11:22.413 --> 11:23.848
Dr. Phil.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.950
You have ocd?

11:27.952 --> 11:30.018
PTSD?

11:30.020 --> 11:31.954
Ocpd?

11:31.956 --> 11:34.290
- Adhd?
- that's enough!

11:34.292 --> 11:36.729
He'll give you a headache
with all of his issues.

11:39.798 --> 11:41.363
What's... what's your problem?

11:41.365 --> 11:43.132
Who, me?

11:43.134 --> 11:45.868
Well, they say that I got
anger management issues,

11:45.870 --> 11:47.070
but I don't see it.

11:47.072 --> 11:48.537
Then again,
there was this one time

11:48.539 --> 11:51.141
where I told this doctor
that I would shank his face

11:51.143 --> 11:53.843
and eat his brains
while he was still alive.

11:53.845 --> 11:57.379
He has ied, intermittent
explosive disorder.

11:57.381 --> 11:58.948
- I do not.
- Do, too.

11:58.950 --> 12:00.883
- I do not.
- Do, too.

12:00.885 --> 12:03.319
- I do not!
- Do, too, Larry.

12:03.321 --> 12:05.254
- Stay the fuck away from me!
- Phil!

12:05.256 --> 12:07.025
Control yourself.

12:12.330 --> 12:15.230
These fuckers are always trying
to mess with my head.

12:15.232 --> 12:16.468
You know?

12:17.903 --> 12:21.403
Patient uses food and anger

12:21.405 --> 12:23.071
to cope with his avoidance

12:23.073 --> 12:25.374
if his insecurity issues.

12:33.485 --> 12:35.350
You think I'm like
everyone else around here.

12:35.352 --> 12:36.920
Barks at the moon.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.189
Well, I'm not,
you high-and-mighty asshole.

12:39.191 --> 12:42.927
Besides, you're the one wearing
the anti-suicide smock, not me.

12:47.298 --> 12:49.364
Listen, kid.

12:49.366 --> 12:51.834
I'm gonna make this easy.

12:51.836 --> 12:54.103
You're average.

12:54.105 --> 12:56.039
You're like vanilla
in an ice cream shop.

12:56.041 --> 12:59.309
The only chances you have
of becoming famous

12:59.311 --> 13:01.978
is running through
a field during the super bowl,

13:01.980 --> 13:03.278
running to the 50-yard line,

13:03.280 --> 13:05.448
and putting gasoline
all over yourself

13:05.450 --> 13:07.483
and lighting your fucking ass
on fire.

13:07.485 --> 13:09.886
In the news,
world renowned urologist

13:09.888 --> 13:11.387
Ahmed abin habidi

13:11.389 --> 13:13.455
recently relocated
from the middle east

13:13.457 --> 13:15.925
to a research facility
in upstate New York

13:15.927 --> 13:17.893
to work on
a urological innovation

13:17.895 --> 13:20.262
known as the bladder project.

13:20.264 --> 13:25.267
- He'll be in this facility for the next...
- There he goes again.

13:25.269 --> 13:27.070
Who's he?

13:27.072 --> 13:29.973
He's the craziest dude
in the institution.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.340
He's got this whole
euro-flash thing.

13:31.342 --> 13:33.977
He thinks he's Jason bourne
or Ethan hunt.

13:33.979 --> 13:37.079
Doesn't talk to anybody.
Just mumbles about conspiracies

13:37.081 --> 13:41.651
and bin laden
and some cockamamie bullshit.

13:41.653 --> 13:43.486
Bin laden?

13:43.488 --> 13:44.621
Isn't he already dead?

13:44.623 --> 13:46.025
Exactly.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.596
I know where he is.

13:53.565 --> 13:55.100
You know where who is?

13:58.636 --> 14:00.138
Bin laden.

14:02.673 --> 14:04.239
Bin laden?

14:04.241 --> 14:05.675
Hey, numb nuts,

14:05.677 --> 14:07.977
bin laden bought it years ago.

14:07.979 --> 14:09.646
Not really, old chap.

14:09.648 --> 14:11.147
That's why they sent me here.

14:11.149 --> 14:13.148
Who the fuck are they?

14:13.150 --> 14:17.420
I believe he's having a recurrent
schizophrenic delusional thing

14:17.422 --> 14:19.622
- whereby he thinks...
- You shut the hell up!

14:19.624 --> 14:21.393
I said, "who are they?"

14:24.229 --> 14:28.998
- The CIA.
- CIA? You?

14:29.000 --> 14:31.968
Oh, you're really off
the reservation.

14:31.970 --> 14:33.268
No wonder you're involuntary.

14:33.270 --> 14:36.204
Oh, my dear pussy,
I'm only involuntary

14:36.206 --> 14:38.675
because they set me up.

14:38.677 --> 14:41.344
Who the fuck
are you calling pussy?

14:41.346 --> 14:42.445
- Fucking call me pussy?
- I wouldn't do that.

14:42.447 --> 14:44.513
Get off of me.
Get off me.

14:44.515 --> 14:46.416
- Let's go.
- Get your fucking hands off me!

14:46.418 --> 14:47.983
Let's go!

14:47.985 --> 14:50.219
Get off me!
Come on, fucker. Come on!

14:50.221 --> 14:51.590
Let's go. Let's go.

14:54.359 --> 14:56.128
He's very excitable.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.244
Mister?

15:13.244 --> 15:16.112
Uh... mister?

15:16.114 --> 15:17.182
Smith.

15:18.182 --> 15:19.617
Uh, Smith.

15:23.120 --> 15:25.024
Do you really know
where bin laden is?

15:29.293 --> 15:31.661
I most certainly do, Felix.

15:31.663 --> 15:34.097
And if you can get me
out of here,

15:34.099 --> 15:35.765
I'll make sure you end up
having tea

15:35.767 --> 15:37.603
on the telly
with Barbara Walters.

16:24.048 --> 16:25.350
Something you want to tell us?

16:27.351 --> 16:28.620
Have it your way.

16:36.260 --> 16:38.197
Time for a new batch
of delusions.

16:40.331 --> 16:42.598
You are aware
that hypnotic drugs

16:42.600 --> 16:45.401
have proven
rather ineffectual

16:45.403 --> 16:48.371
in conventional interrogation.

16:48.373 --> 16:50.506
I suggest the use of pliers

16:50.508 --> 16:54.509
for the extraction
of molars and fingernails.

16:56.514 --> 16:58.116
In due time, Mr. Smith.

16:59.216 --> 17:00.418
In due time.

17:10.228 --> 17:12.131
Ready to talk
about jackpot now?

17:16.267 --> 17:17.435
No?

17:27.644 --> 17:30.513
Still time
to change your mind.

17:30.515 --> 17:32.751
You'll have to do better
than that, my good man.

17:48.732 --> 17:50.766
Last chance.

17:50.768 --> 17:53.169
Get on with it.

18:00.211 --> 18:01.611
How's that feel, Mr. Smith?

18:01.613 --> 18:06.315
Shocking.
positively shocking.

18:06.317 --> 18:07.616
Shall I continue?

18:07.618 --> 18:10.186
Please! but don't stop now,
old boy.

18:10.188 --> 18:13.788
My sinuses have almost cleared.

18:17.929 --> 18:19.230
Had enough?

18:23.401 --> 18:25.668
I can't do this anymore.

18:25.670 --> 18:28.171
Tell your supervisor
I'm done.

18:29.473 --> 18:30.773
It's not
in my job description.

18:30.775 --> 18:32.144
Untie him.

18:37.781 --> 18:39.548
- He in yet?
- He's just finishing up.

18:39.550 --> 18:40.685
You can go in.

18:58.769 --> 19:01.405
So, how did it go?

19:02.673 --> 19:04.207
Not good, I'm afraid.

19:04.209 --> 19:06.642
God damn it.

19:06.644 --> 19:10.680
I knew that shrink psychoanalytical
mumbo jumbo wouldn't work.

19:10.682 --> 19:11.881
Smith's the best, sir.

19:11.883 --> 19:14.984
Oh, second best.

19:14.986 --> 19:17.620
Of course, sir.
My apologies.

19:17.622 --> 19:20.555
I promise you this.

19:20.557 --> 19:22.225
Once Smith talks

19:22.227 --> 19:24.427
or we find jackpot ourselves,

19:24.429 --> 19:25.661
Smith's done.

19:25.663 --> 19:28.166
No two ways about it.
He's done.

19:52.289 --> 19:54.792
Uh... Mr. Smith?

19:57.028 --> 20:00.496
Do you remember
our bin laden conversation?

20:00.498 --> 20:01.732
Jackpot.

20:02.933 --> 20:04.366
Excuse me?

20:04.368 --> 20:05.901
Intelligence circles
commonly refer

20:05.903 --> 20:07.605
to the target as jackpot.

20:09.906 --> 20:11.774
Oh, okay.

20:11.776 --> 20:14.809
Uh, jackpot.

20:14.811 --> 20:16.647
Do you really know where he...

20:20.417 --> 20:22.221
What are you doing?

20:25.522 --> 20:27.425
Preparation
is half the victory.

20:31.996 --> 20:33.863
I don't mean to be pushy,

20:33.865 --> 20:36.465
but...

20:36.467 --> 20:37.536
Come on.

20:39.703 --> 20:42.337
Jackpot's dead.

20:42.339 --> 20:44.306
Just because our leaders
say it's so

20:44.308 --> 20:45.644
doesn't make it so.

20:47.511 --> 20:49.981
But how do you...
How do you know?

20:53.884 --> 20:56.421
I'm the only one privy
to the doctor.

20:57.387 --> 20:58.856
Doctor? what doctor?

21:00.657 --> 21:02.757
If you had a serious ailment,

21:02.759 --> 21:04.994
and the only one that could
assist you lived far away,

21:04.996 --> 21:07.796
would you move?

21:07.798 --> 21:09.465
Yeah, sure.

21:09.467 --> 21:11.433
Congratulations, old boy.

21:11.435 --> 21:14.603
You know more
than my old colleague did.

21:14.605 --> 21:18.043
A man of means must make
his health a priority.

21:20.944 --> 21:23.078
Smith.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.915
Medication time.

21:27.451 --> 21:30.555
Get me out of here, Felix.
You won't regret it.

22:03.954 --> 22:05.022
Hey.

22:10.728 --> 22:12.495
You scared me.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.528
Whatcha doing?

22:13.530 --> 22:15.064
Looking for a way out.

22:15.066 --> 22:17.032
Why? you just got here.

22:17.034 --> 22:18.670
I don't belong here.

22:20.904 --> 22:24.873
Finally got the opportunity to
do something really important

22:24.875 --> 22:25.911
and be somebody.

22:27.511 --> 22:29.478
Why are you so hyped
to be somebody?

22:29.480 --> 22:31.846
You wouldn't understand.

22:31.848 --> 22:32.914
If I were famous,

22:32.916 --> 22:35.953
like really famous...

22:37.888 --> 22:39.854
People would seek me out.

22:39.856 --> 22:41.058
I'd have value.

22:42.759 --> 22:44.559
People would
finally notice me.

22:44.561 --> 22:46.061
If being famous were so great,

22:46.063 --> 22:48.963
then how come
almost every celebrity

22:48.965 --> 22:50.434
has tried suicide?

22:51.803 --> 22:53.669
Where'd you hear that?
Why would a celebrity

22:53.671 --> 22:55.537
try to kill themselves?
They've already made it.

22:55.539 --> 22:57.506
Trust me. Almost everybody
in Hollywood

22:57.508 --> 23:00.112
has thought about suicide
at one point or another.

23:04.115 --> 23:06.614
You know what's worse than
being bullied or hated?

23:06.616 --> 23:09.651
Being anally raped
by Santa claus.

23:09.653 --> 23:12.758
No, being ignored.

23:14.459 --> 23:18.893
Out there, I can actually
become something.

23:18.895 --> 23:21.130
It's a total waste of my time
being in here.

23:21.132 --> 23:24.165
- There's no benefit.
- Are you serious?

23:24.167 --> 23:27.036
Uh, this place is awesome.

23:27.038 --> 23:31.172
Number one: You get
three square meals a day.

23:31.174 --> 23:33.909
Number two:
You get unlimited time

23:33.911 --> 23:36.511
to watch TV and color.

23:36.513 --> 23:38.046
You get to kick back

23:38.048 --> 23:40.783
with cool people who share
the same problems as you.

23:40.785 --> 23:42.985
They give you these cool,
comfy clothes to wear.

23:42.987 --> 23:44.753
Plus, most importantly,

23:44.755 --> 23:47.189
you get the undivided attention
of medical professionals

23:47.191 --> 23:50.961
whose sole purpose
is to make you feel good.

23:52.028 --> 23:53.531
Now, what is wrong with that?

23:55.599 --> 23:57.001
Hey, you wanna escape with me?

23:58.603 --> 24:01.006
Dude, did anything I say
just sink in?

24:02.906 --> 24:05.274
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:05.276 --> 24:07.879
I don't mean to be rude,
but I gotta get going.

25:08.105 --> 25:09.240
What?

25:11.241 --> 25:12.510
You got a little...

25:15.211 --> 25:19.081
I'd like
you to join our escape

25:19.083 --> 25:20.615
so we can capture bin laden.

25:20.617 --> 25:21.850
What?

25:21.852 --> 25:23.352
I need a guy

25:23.354 --> 25:24.886
with strength and size

25:24.888 --> 25:27.055
in case things get physical.

25:27.057 --> 25:29.892
I've already recruited
Dr. Phil.

25:29.894 --> 25:31.326
There's an escape
planning session

25:31.328 --> 25:33.295
in my room in one hour.

25:33.297 --> 25:34.729
Okay?

25:34.731 --> 25:37.298
You actually took
Smith seriously?

25:37.300 --> 25:39.367
You're so gullible, Marcus.

25:39.369 --> 25:42.071
News flash: Smith isn't
a secret agent,

25:42.073 --> 25:44.105
and he doesn't know anything
about bin laden.

25:44.107 --> 25:46.208
- How do you know?
- Dude, you're so caught up

25:46.210 --> 25:48.076
on being on the cover
of "time" magazine

25:48.078 --> 25:50.011
that you can't see straight.

25:50.013 --> 25:52.247
Believing in Smith is like
believing I'm a ballet dancer.

25:52.249 --> 25:55.049
All right, fine. If you don't
want fame and freedom,

25:55.051 --> 25:58.956
then that's your loss. I guess there's
so much to look forward to being...

26:00.324 --> 26:01.726
Stuck in this place.

26:05.162 --> 26:06.664
That ice cream's
for everybody.

26:08.098 --> 26:09.965
Selfish.

26:09.967 --> 26:11.667
It's my ice cream.

26:11.669 --> 26:13.271
It's my fucking ice cream.

26:14.971 --> 26:16.340
My fucking ice cream.

26:17.775 --> 26:18.974
After some detailed planning,

26:18.976 --> 26:20.642
this is what
we've come up with.

26:20.644 --> 26:22.311
Okay? all right?
And this is the way

26:22.313 --> 26:23.982
- it's gonna work...
- Hey, am I late?

26:25.782 --> 26:27.016
I thought
you weren't interested.

26:27.018 --> 26:29.151
I'm not.

26:29.153 --> 26:31.085
But the fact that I get
a chance to see you wackazoids

26:31.087 --> 26:33.287
create a clusterfuck,
i wouldn't miss that.

26:33.289 --> 26:36.257
Okay.

26:36.259 --> 26:37.892
- Let's get started.
- Okay.

26:37.894 --> 26:40.228
Smith?

26:40.230 --> 26:42.030
Yes.

26:42.032 --> 26:43.798
Gentlemen...

26:43.800 --> 26:46.768
To unlock our rooms
after lights out,

26:46.770 --> 26:48.036
we'll need
the good doctor here

26:48.038 --> 26:49.771
to lure the attendant
to his room

26:49.773 --> 26:51.974
so he may lift his keys.

26:51.976 --> 26:55.376
How do you suggest I do that?

26:55.378 --> 26:57.312
Perhaps a mock seizure

26:57.314 --> 26:59.815
or threaten
to kill yourself.

26:59.817 --> 27:00.982
Just threaten?

27:00.984 --> 27:02.351
Hey, Einstein,

27:02.353 --> 27:04.018
every nook and cranny
of this place

27:04.020 --> 27:05.219
has security cameras.

27:05.221 --> 27:06.755
And there are guards
everywhere.

27:06.757 --> 27:07.922
You won't be able
to leave this floor,

27:07.924 --> 27:10.124
let alone the fricking dorm.

27:10.126 --> 27:11.427
Well, we can avoid
the cameras

27:11.429 --> 27:15.998
by...

27:16.000 --> 27:17.268
It's okay.

27:22.306 --> 27:24.238
You know what?
Don't... don't worry.

27:24.240 --> 27:27.308
We have a plan. We just...
We just have to hurry.

27:27.310 --> 27:29.344
It's good to see you taking
such an interest

27:29.346 --> 27:30.712
in something, Bob.

27:30.714 --> 27:32.914
Thanks, Phil.

27:32.916 --> 27:35.750
This is not gonna work.

27:35.752 --> 27:37.321
Not with that attitude.

27:52.803 --> 27:54.072
Now, that felt good.

27:56.507 --> 27:59.341
That's the way
it is, huh?

27:59.343 --> 28:02.013
Just because
of some little white lie.

28:03.079 --> 28:06.014
Have it your way.

28:06.016 --> 28:08.217
But remember...

28:08.219 --> 28:11.319
I'm in charge now.

28:11.321 --> 28:15.159
So you better start flapping
your gums about jackpot.

28:17.127 --> 28:19.527
Because if you don't,

28:19.529 --> 28:21.162
I'm gonna make sure

28:21.164 --> 28:23.167
you shit bricks in hell.

29:06.977 --> 29:08.943
Shh.

29:08.945 --> 29:11.412
Why aren't you wearing
any pants, Phil?

29:11.414 --> 29:15.452
So that my genitals
might breathe as I slumber.

29:21.826 --> 29:23.525
Hey, open up my fucking door.

29:30.134 --> 29:32.066
Oh, that's a relief.

29:32.068 --> 29:33.270
I thought
he was uncircumcised.

29:36.406 --> 29:39.373
We can use the air
ducts to get past the cameras.

29:39.375 --> 29:41.445
That's your plan?

29:55.593 --> 29:56.991
Oh, shit.

29:56.993 --> 29:58.626
Oh, shit.

29:58.628 --> 30:01.462
Someone's gonna
have a tight fit in here.

30:02.566 --> 30:03.802
Hey.

30:08.038 --> 30:09.307
Guys...

30:10.507 --> 30:12.074
Smith's not in his room.

30:12.076 --> 30:13.812
What?

30:15.578 --> 30:17.112
Shit!

30:17.114 --> 30:18.149
You guys okay?

30:19.916 --> 30:21.249
We gotta find Smith.

30:21.251 --> 30:22.985
We can't escape without him.

30:22.987 --> 30:25.219
Well, he's probably
in the observation room.

30:25.221 --> 30:26.388
I'll show you the way.

30:26.390 --> 30:28.393
Oh, jee... god.

30:43.307 --> 30:44.976
Why do they treat him
this way?

30:46.210 --> 30:48.009
Good question.

30:48.011 --> 30:51.212
In spite of Smith's
constant hallucinatory state,

30:51.214 --> 30:54.917
I have yet to see him once
fling poo since he's been here.

30:54.919 --> 30:57.084
Fling poo?

30:57.086 --> 30:59.520
Well, the technical term
is scatolia.

30:59.522 --> 31:03.458
It's the creative art of throwing
and smearing one's feces

31:03.460 --> 31:05.563
as a form of protest.

31:06.563 --> 31:07.962
That's nasty.

31:07.964 --> 31:11.065
Pure hatred
in solitary confinement

31:11.067 --> 31:14.568
is enough to break
even the hardest patient.

31:14.570 --> 31:19.207
We're all just one bad day away
from eating each other's feces.

31:19.209 --> 31:21.012
That's my theory, anyway.

31:22.078 --> 31:23.978
Well, my Willy's chilly.

31:23.980 --> 31:25.482
I'm off to get some pants,
gentlemen.

31:35.659 --> 31:37.992
Smith. Smith!

31:37.994 --> 31:39.062
Smith!

31:40.064 --> 31:41.330
You okay?

31:41.332 --> 31:43.332
Ah, Felix.
Aren't you rather late

31:43.334 --> 31:45.103
for a turn-down service?

31:53.309 --> 31:54.676
Seems I'm having
a slight malfunction

31:54.678 --> 31:56.510
with the rotating blade
on my wristwatch

31:56.512 --> 31:57.915
yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah...

31:59.415 --> 32:01.351
Come on. Come on. Come on.

32:06.056 --> 32:08.323
You're a good friend, Felix.

32:08.325 --> 32:09.994
A good friend indeed.

32:21.538 --> 32:24.174
Who the hell
chose the pecking order?

32:25.342 --> 32:26.511
What's the problem now, Larry?

32:28.345 --> 32:31.113
Besides having Dr. Phil's
vertical smile in my face,

32:31.115 --> 32:32.413
I'm just dandy.

32:32.415 --> 32:34.415
I'm terribly sorry.

32:34.417 --> 32:37.251
My claustrophobia's
producing excess wind

32:37.253 --> 32:39.587
- in my butthole.
- Somebody shoot me.

32:39.589 --> 32:41.088
Here comes another one.

32:50.099 --> 32:51.269
Shh.

32:55.338 --> 32:57.240
Slow it down.

33:30.707 --> 33:33.177
Oh, shit.

33:38.481 --> 33:40.715
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What? What?

33:40.717 --> 33:42.150
There might be an alarm.

33:42.152 --> 33:44.322
Beautiful.
now what do we do?

33:49.792 --> 33:51.226
Go, go, go.

33:51.228 --> 33:53.163
Oh, Jesus.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.500
- Fuck you, Montgomery!
- Shh, shh.

33:59.502 --> 34:01.103
Stop!

34:01.105 --> 34:03.104
Oh, come on.

34:03.106 --> 34:05.140
How did you guys
get out of your dorms?

34:05.142 --> 34:06.807
Well, we... we...

34:06.809 --> 34:09.577
We got a little turned around
and...

34:09.579 --> 34:12.746
You all better get back inside
before somebody gets hurt.

34:12.748 --> 34:15.318
There's no need
for physical violence.

34:28.898 --> 34:30.467
Just put the kettle on, Felix.

35:01.664 --> 35:03.498
You're right, old chap.

35:03.500 --> 35:04.802
Somebody did get hurt.

35:08.804 --> 35:10.507
It's that way.

35:11.708 --> 35:12.941
- Which way?
- Over there.

35:12.943 --> 35:14.846
Other way.
That way. Let's go.

35:17.847 --> 35:19.648
Sorry.

35:19.650 --> 35:21.119
Sorry.

35:30.594 --> 35:31.762
Smith!

35:33.362 --> 35:34.531
There!

35:40.570 --> 35:41.905
Smith, where do we go next?

35:44.208 --> 35:45.639
Smith. Smith!

35:45.641 --> 35:47.508
Dude, you're pumping
a dry well with this guy.

35:47.510 --> 35:49.344
Smith, we're counting on you.

35:49.346 --> 35:50.945
So pull yourself together

35:50.947 --> 35:52.449
and tell us where we're going.

35:53.449 --> 35:55.983
142 Kensington way.

35:55.985 --> 35:57.818
That-a boy.

35:57.820 --> 35:59.887
What's the zip code?

36:04.393 --> 36:05.594
They got out.

36:05.596 --> 36:07.461
Good.

36:07.463 --> 36:08.532
Follow them.

36:47.336 --> 36:48.940
An amc gremlin?

37:23.306 --> 37:24.773
Where are we going next?

37:24.775 --> 37:27.409
I can't divulge information
at present.

37:27.411 --> 37:30.445
You can't... what do you mean,
you can't divulge?

37:30.447 --> 37:31.916
We're
in the fucking blind here.

37:32.983 --> 37:33.985
We'll need weapons.

37:35.385 --> 37:36.450
Weapons.

37:36.452 --> 37:37.521
That's it?

37:38.655 --> 37:40.021
For now.

37:40.023 --> 37:41.990
We're on a mission
to hunt

37:41.992 --> 37:44.025
one of the most wanted men
in the world,

37:44.027 --> 37:45.726
and that's all you tell us?

37:45.728 --> 37:49.697
Well, patient exhibits paranoid
personality disorder,

37:49.699 --> 37:52.700
characterized by pervasive
distrust of others.

37:52.702 --> 37:55.003
We're all on board, Smith.

37:55.005 --> 37:56.907
Let's... let's get it done.

38:17.827 --> 38:21.595
Well, definitely not
for hoplophobics.

38:21.597 --> 38:23.965
What's a...
What's a hoplophobic?

38:23.967 --> 38:26.903
One who has an irrational fear
of firearms.

38:30.606 --> 38:32.507
Thompson, my good man.

38:32.509 --> 38:33.807
I'll need you to equip me

38:33.809 --> 38:37.045
with a subfusil Sterling l2a1

38:37.047 --> 38:38.912
for this mission.

38:38.914 --> 38:43.117
Subfusil Sterling.

38:43.119 --> 38:45.052
Ain't nobody be askin'
about that gun

38:45.054 --> 38:46.454
less'n they're British army

38:46.456 --> 38:48.826
or some sort
of english double...

38:51.061 --> 38:52.427
Agent.

38:52.429 --> 38:54.795
We'll need
four .9mm heckler & koch

38:54.797 --> 38:56.831
mp5 submachine guns,

38:56.833 --> 38:59.700
each equipped with a pelican m6
light front sight mount

38:59.702 --> 39:02.570
and a thousand rounds
of 9mm parabellum ammo.

39:02.572 --> 39:06.407
Also an m79
.44mm grenade launcher

39:06.409 --> 39:08.943
with sub-caliber inserts
and 12 Gauge ammo.

39:08.945 --> 39:11.713
And, finally, four steel
monolithic body armor plates

39:11.715 --> 39:14.849
along with four night optics
thermal imaging binocular goggles.

39:14.851 --> 39:16.117
And some camouflage...

39:16.119 --> 39:17.851
The smock's
really uncomfortable.

39:17.853 --> 39:21.358
And more food. We need more
food, for Christ sake.

39:22.692 --> 39:24.527
You fellas from the circus
or something?

39:27.764 --> 39:29.133
Can we get some help, please?

39:31.867 --> 39:35.706
What you intend on doing
with all this weaponry?

39:38.742 --> 39:40.874
We're going to kill...

39:40.876 --> 39:42.876
Osama bin laden.

39:42.878 --> 39:45.112
You can't just blurt it out
like that, you asshole.

39:45.114 --> 39:47.849
He's gonna think we're crazy.

39:47.851 --> 39:49.450
Well?

39:49.452 --> 39:52.887
Uh, I can sell you most
of what you want now,

39:52.889 --> 39:54.959
but you're gonna have to pass
a background check.

39:56.059 --> 39:57.157
B... background check?

39:57.159 --> 39:58.693
Yeah.

39:58.695 --> 40:00.965
And, looking at you fellas...

40:02.798 --> 40:06.800
It'll be a much needed
background check.

40:06.802 --> 40:08.235
All right?

40:08.237 --> 40:10.604
Let's get it over with.

40:10.606 --> 40:13.641
Any of you fellas ever been dishonorably
discharged from the military

40:13.643 --> 40:15.746
or renounce
your U.S. citizenship?

40:17.179 --> 40:18.979
Ever been convicted of a crime

40:18.981 --> 40:21.548
punishable by more
than one year in prison?

40:21.550 --> 40:23.117
More than one year?

40:23.119 --> 40:27.088
Ever been convicted
of any drug crimes?

40:27.090 --> 40:28.826
Does that include using?

40:30.626 --> 40:33.228
Ever been declared
legally incompetent

40:33.230 --> 40:36.831
or mentally incapacitated?

40:36.833 --> 40:40.168
Well, that was fun.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

40:40.170 --> 40:41.505
Wait.

40:43.539 --> 40:44.639
We need weapons.

40:44.641 --> 40:48.175
Sorry,
i can't help you fellas.

40:48.177 --> 40:49.744
- You need more targets?
- Yeah.

40:56.887 --> 40:58.522
Whoa now. Whoa.

41:02.759 --> 41:04.559
Can you help us now?

41:04.561 --> 41:06.528
Move real slow.

41:06.530 --> 41:07.832
Real slow.

41:15.739 --> 41:19.072
You fellas don't wanna wind up in a
whole heap of trouble now, do you?

41:19.074 --> 41:20.742
No, no, we just...
We don't need

41:20.744 --> 41:22.146
a background check.
That's all.

41:36.559 --> 41:39.193
That... that
should cover everything.

41:39.195 --> 41:40.231
All right.

41:45.001 --> 41:48.806
Fellas, I found
the grenade launcher.

41:55.210 --> 41:56.246
Oh...

42:00.182 --> 42:02.820
Looks like a bad case
of erectile dysfunction.

42:09.960 --> 42:12.760
They won't get far.

42:12.762 --> 42:14.929
That was not smart.
That was not smart at all.

42:14.931 --> 42:16.597
What the fuck were you
doing back there?

42:16.599 --> 42:19.032
Smith said we needed guns
to capture bin laden.

42:19.034 --> 42:21.168
Capture bin laden? You're still
thinking about bin laden?

42:21.170 --> 42:22.903
I'm worried about getting
through the day.

42:22.905 --> 42:24.805
Oh, why are you worried?

42:24.807 --> 42:26.074
Dude, are you high?

42:26.076 --> 42:27.809
We just broke
out of an institution

42:27.811 --> 42:29.610
and committed armed robbery
in the same day.

42:29.612 --> 42:31.211
You don't think anybody
was gonna raise a brow?

42:31.213 --> 42:34.349
It's not like we're hardened
lifers escaping from prison.

42:34.351 --> 42:36.717
Guys, look, I paid for the stuff
at the gun store.

42:36.719 --> 42:38.686
- We're fine.
- You're delusional.

42:38.688 --> 42:40.822
At least I have an excuse why
I'm at Montgomery, but you...

42:40.824 --> 42:42.090
You're genuinely crazy.

42:42.092 --> 42:43.724
Yeah, there's no gray area
with you.

42:43.726 --> 42:45.860
You are certified
the real deal.

42:49.032 --> 42:51.365
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit!

42:51.367 --> 42:54.270
Looks like it's time for
a sporting game of leapfrog.

42:57.940 --> 43:00.907
Don't wave at the cop!

43:00.909 --> 43:03.911
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit, he's getting closer.

43:03.913 --> 43:05.213
Well, look at that.

43:29.972 --> 43:31.104
He's gaining on us!

43:31.106 --> 43:32.141
Oh, god!

43:33.443 --> 43:37.311
We got a cop... lots...

43:46.356 --> 43:49.123
This guy's on our ass
like liberace.

43:49.125 --> 43:52.293
Smith, do something secret-agent
like to shake this guy.

43:52.295 --> 43:53.695
Very good, pussy.

43:53.697 --> 43:55.295
Time to test out
Thompson's modifications

43:55.297 --> 43:56.899
on our defense mechanisms.

43:59.001 --> 44:00.233
Nothing.

44:00.235 --> 44:01.369
That usually does the trick.

44:01.371 --> 44:02.704
Do something!

44:02.706 --> 44:04.137
Well, this switch activates

44:04.139 --> 44:05.840
the ejector passenger seat
for all passengers.

44:05.842 --> 44:07.874
- So should we give it a go?
- No!

44:46.148 --> 44:48.249
What are we doing?

44:48.251 --> 44:50.851
Don't get your knickers
in a twist, Felix.

44:50.853 --> 44:53.019
- Let's go.
- Go where?

44:53.021 --> 44:55.021
Doodletown, New York.

44:55.023 --> 44:56.791
- Doodletown?
- that's correct, pussy.

44:56.793 --> 45:00.161
- Doodletown.
- oh, yeah, that's a relief.

45:00.163 --> 45:03.396
I thought we were gonna fight armed
soldiers deep in the heart of Pakistan.

45:03.398 --> 45:05.333
Thank goodness the most
wanted man in the world

45:05.335 --> 45:07.267
is hiding behind the counter of
some doodletown convenience mart

45:07.269 --> 45:09.405
making slushies
and week-old hotdogs.

45:16.112 --> 45:17.380
Let's go.

45:23.418 --> 45:26.287
Time to commandeer a new mode
of transportation.

45:26.289 --> 45:28.923
- Need to inspect the guns.
- You don't need to inspect the guns.

45:28.925 --> 45:30.791
Let me inspect my gun.
I need to inspect the guns.

45:30.793 --> 45:32.226
I'm the one who should be
holding the guns.

45:32.228 --> 45:34.128
I'm the most well adjusted
out of all of us.

45:34.130 --> 45:36.898
Let me see the gun so I can
make sure that it fires well.

45:36.900 --> 45:38.865
Did you have to bring the
grenade launcher with you?

45:38.867 --> 45:40.267
It's a little hard
to keep inconspicuous...

45:40.269 --> 45:41.501
We needed the grenade launcher,
okay?

45:41.503 --> 45:43.137
Do you even know
where doodletown is?

45:43.139 --> 45:44.438
Well, I don't know
where doodletown...

45:44.440 --> 45:46.941
Mr. flintstone,
can I have your autograph?

45:46.943 --> 45:49.209
Uh...

45:49.211 --> 45:52.112
I, uh, look, kid. I think you got me
confused with someone else, all right?

45:52.114 --> 45:54.148
Don't think so.

45:54.150 --> 45:56.950
You look just like the guy
on my vitamin bottle.

45:56.952 --> 45:59.153
Get lost, kid.

45:59.155 --> 46:01.889
Uh, patient lashes out
at child.

46:01.891 --> 46:04.291
Indicates borderline tendencies
for pedophobia.

46:04.293 --> 46:06.193
I'm not a pedophile,
you asshole!

46:06.195 --> 46:09.563
I said pedophobia. It means
"innate fear of children."

46:09.565 --> 46:12.400
Oh, okay, but watch out
with those erroneous labels.

46:12.402 --> 46:14.534
Montgomery has a big file
on me already.

46:14.536 --> 46:16.369
Well, you do have hsp,

46:16.371 --> 46:19.407
and that means
"highly sensitive person."

46:19.409 --> 46:21.077
Don't you tell...

46:24.447 --> 46:26.012
How appropriate.

46:26.014 --> 46:28.249
A bunch of mental patients
in a short bus.

46:28.251 --> 46:30.153
Won't be hard to spot.

46:44.900 --> 46:45.935
We got 'em.

46:49.505 --> 46:53.139
Gentlemen, we'll need a
suitable place for training.

46:53.141 --> 46:54.508
Training for what?

46:54.510 --> 46:55.943
For the guns?

46:55.945 --> 46:58.481
You can't tango
without a few lessons.

47:00.315 --> 47:03.953
I got something.
Put 381 Macy into your GPS.

47:17.233 --> 47:19.503
Yeah, work on that.
Work on that one.

47:22.338 --> 47:24.572
And then try a hook.
Try a hook shot.

47:24.574 --> 47:28.108
I want you to try it right
handed and then left handed.

47:28.110 --> 47:29.980
There you go.
There you go.

47:32.081 --> 47:34.084
Nice. nice. Good.
Good work.

47:45.427 --> 47:47.961
Well, there he is.

47:47.963 --> 47:50.333
Making any progress getting
your name in lights?

47:52.034 --> 47:53.501
What did you, uh...

47:53.503 --> 47:55.670
- Join the army or something?
- It's funny you ask.

47:55.672 --> 47:58.104
I'm actually right in the middle
of something really important.

47:58.106 --> 48:00.141
It's gonna make me
a household name.

48:00.143 --> 48:03.476
Oh, great. What is it?

48:03.478 --> 48:04.612
Well, I can't say,

48:04.614 --> 48:06.981
but, believe me, it's huge.

48:06.983 --> 48:10.217
Oh, well, that's...
That's wonderful.

48:10.219 --> 48:14.088
Anyway, I was wondering if me
and a few friends of mine

48:14.090 --> 48:16.990
could use the shooting range
for some target practice.

48:16.992 --> 48:18.358
- Oh...
- oh.

48:18.360 --> 48:20.695
Your father took that down

48:20.697 --> 48:22.563
a long time ago.

48:22.565 --> 48:24.465
- You did?
- Justin,

48:24.467 --> 48:26.467
go over the song on page nine,

48:26.469 --> 48:30.104
and after that, we are going
to rehearse your lines.

48:30.106 --> 48:31.408
Uh, reverse layup.

48:33.309 --> 48:35.476
Why don't you do
the reverse layup?

48:35.478 --> 48:37.144
Try a few more of those,
okay?

48:37.146 --> 48:39.280
Who's he?

48:39.282 --> 48:42.986
That's little Justin from... remember?
The boy from down the street.

48:44.186 --> 48:46.086
I thought he moved away
years ago.

48:46.088 --> 48:48.621
He was on "the young
and the restless" last month,

48:48.623 --> 48:54.161
and now we are preparing
for a Disney audition.

48:54.163 --> 48:58.032
We? he's not even a relative.

48:58.034 --> 48:59.766
He's the neighborhood boy.
We all raised him.

48:59.768 --> 49:01.501
I mean...

49:01.503 --> 49:04.104
Don't you know the expression
"it takes a village"?

49:04.106 --> 49:06.574
What are you guys doing?

49:06.576 --> 49:08.208
What do you mean?

49:08.210 --> 49:09.677
I've been busting my butt
for years

49:09.679 --> 49:11.612
trying to make you
proud of me,

49:11.614 --> 49:13.014
and instead of supporting me,

49:13.016 --> 49:14.315
it looks like you've started

49:14.317 --> 49:16.117
some sort of future-famous
training school

49:16.119 --> 49:17.117
for wayward strangers.

49:17.119 --> 49:19.487
They are not wayward strangers.

49:19.489 --> 49:20.657
They are family.

49:23.291 --> 49:25.159
You guys gave up on me,
didn't you?

49:25.161 --> 49:27.128
- Oh...
- no.

49:27.130 --> 49:30.331
We... we just realized you
weren't cut out for stardom.

49:30.333 --> 49:32.501
So once you labeled me...

49:34.202 --> 49:35.769
A failure,

49:35.771 --> 49:38.204
you just went out and found
a couple of replacements.

49:38.206 --> 49:41.641
No, we didn't want to put
any more pressure on you.

49:41.643 --> 49:45.780
Pressure? oh, all right. So the first
time you see me after all these years,

49:45.782 --> 49:49.349
and say, "are you having any progress
getting your name in lights,

49:49.351 --> 49:51.217
that's not putting
any pressure on me.

49:51.219 --> 49:53.220
What your father
meant to say was...

49:53.222 --> 49:55.322
Time to go, Felix.

49:55.324 --> 49:59.059
Oh, don't leave like this, Bob.
Bernie, say something.

49:59.061 --> 50:01.695
Hi, Mr. Marcus. Thanks for the sneakers.
I really love them.

50:01.697 --> 50:03.563
- Oh, good fit?
- Oh, fit like a glove.

50:03.565 --> 50:05.800
They actually gave me, like,
five inches on my vertical.

50:05.802 --> 50:07.403
- Wanna see?
- Sure.

50:13.376 --> 50:14.675
Really nice.

50:14.677 --> 50:16.246
I gotta go.

50:26.822 --> 50:28.190
That's good.

50:34.230 --> 50:36.396
I guess Thomas wolfe
was right, huh?

50:36.398 --> 50:38.367
We can never go home again.

50:40.670 --> 50:41.869
I guess.

50:41.871 --> 50:43.804
Buck up, Marcus.

50:43.806 --> 50:46.639
You can't let no dipshit
stand in your way.

50:46.641 --> 50:48.778
You want it, go get it.

51:38.460 --> 51:40.494
This is great.
This is great.

51:40.496 --> 51:43.467
I told you that Smith didn't
know what the hell he was doing.

51:44.833 --> 51:47.203
Time for a little hike, mates.

51:52.407 --> 51:53.710
Smile.

51:55.443 --> 51:58.414
Smith. hey.

52:03.686 --> 52:06.387
Smith, so how's our chances
looking?

52:06.389 --> 52:08.956
Felix, we're as good as being
dealt a straight flush

52:08.958 --> 52:10.791
in five-card poker.

52:17.500 --> 52:19.200
Hey, hey, hey, what's wrong?

52:22.271 --> 52:25.338
- Agoraphobia.
- agoraphobia?

52:25.340 --> 52:27.273
Agoraphobia, you asshole.

52:27.275 --> 52:30.311
I have a fear
of wide open spaces.

52:30.313 --> 52:31.979
How are you going to walk
with us

52:31.981 --> 52:34.248
if you have a fear
of wide open spaces?

52:34.250 --> 52:35.548
There's nothing
around us for miles.

52:35.550 --> 52:37.918
Exactly.

52:37.920 --> 52:39.887
Wow.
you got a lot of problems.

52:39.889 --> 52:42.456
Anger issues, eating disorder,
and now you...

52:42.458 --> 52:44.427
That's why I'm at Montgomery,
you dickwad!

52:45.795 --> 52:48.695
Uh... look, we got a problem.

52:48.697 --> 52:50.496
He's got a fear
of wide open spaces.

52:50.498 --> 52:51.932
Agoraphobia?

52:51.934 --> 52:53.700
No. no, no.
No, no, no, Phil.

52:53.702 --> 52:56.369
Phil, hey, hey, hey...

52:56.371 --> 52:58.438
Hey.

52:58.440 --> 52:59.509
Relax.

53:03.813 --> 53:04.814
What?

53:10.318 --> 53:11.487
N...

53:21.896 --> 53:24.934
You still thinking about wide
open spaces, my dear pussy?

53:33.876 --> 53:35.775
Hey.

53:35.777 --> 53:37.911
Wait! Smith, wait.

53:37.913 --> 53:39.345
Stop walking.

53:39.347 --> 53:40.813
You can't just go off
by yourself.

53:40.815 --> 53:42.650
We have a rendezvous
in precisely two hours.

53:42.652 --> 53:44.485
I can't wait for pussy.

53:44.487 --> 53:46.854
So what ever happened to your
credo "leave no man behind"?

53:46.856 --> 53:50.523
Step aside. I've not time
for rank amateurs.

53:50.525 --> 53:52.492
Stop wasting time.

53:52.494 --> 53:54.795
- Now, move your bloody arse.
- "Bloody arse"?

53:54.797 --> 53:55.896
Let me ask you a question.
I'm curious.

53:55.898 --> 53:58.432
Are you even American?

53:58.434 --> 54:01.334
I am red, white, and blue
all the way through, Felix.

54:01.336 --> 54:03.003
I've dedicated my entire live

54:03.005 --> 54:04.671
to this one defining moment.

54:04.673 --> 54:07.608
Right here, right now.

54:07.610 --> 54:09.479
Time to avenge 9/11.

54:10.478 --> 54:11.480
Screw this!

54:12.481 --> 54:13.880
Screw this.

54:13.882 --> 54:17.784
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

54:17.786 --> 54:22.021
Larry! what is going on
around here?

54:22.023 --> 54:24.657
Now it's every man
for himself?

54:24.659 --> 54:26.929
I cannot handle
another failure.

54:30.398 --> 54:31.835
Failure?

54:36.371 --> 54:38.040
What the hell do you know
about failure?

54:39.909 --> 54:42.842
Unlike you mental defectives,

54:42.844 --> 54:45.479
I was normal.

54:45.481 --> 54:47.981
I used to be
a wall street broker.

54:47.983 --> 54:50.117
I had a beautiful wife,

54:50.119 --> 54:52.019
kids,

54:52.021 --> 54:55.621
a house in the suburbs,

54:55.623 --> 54:57.358
and just out of the blue,

54:57.360 --> 54:59.360
I get laid off.

54:59.362 --> 55:01.994
So, Larry, losing a job
is not the end of the world.

55:01.996 --> 55:04.898
No! it's your wife
suddenly bailing out on you

55:04.900 --> 55:08.969
because you can't give her the
life that she's used to anymore.

55:08.971 --> 55:12.438
It is her falsely accusing you
of assault

55:12.440 --> 55:14.974
because she trips
over your foot on the way out.

55:14.976 --> 55:18.479
It's the cops leading you
out of your house

55:18.481 --> 55:20.748
in handcuffs.

55:20.750 --> 55:23.916
And your kids
are frantic, crying,

55:23.918 --> 55:27.920
"daddy. daddy, daddy!"

55:27.922 --> 55:30.891
- I didn't...
- Take it from me, Marcus.

55:30.893 --> 55:32.693
There comes a point
in everyone's life

55:32.695 --> 55:35.061
where you have got to take
a hard look

55:35.063 --> 55:36.832
and see the reality
around you...

55:38.967 --> 55:41.534
And take matters
into your own hands.

55:41.536 --> 55:43.872
W... whoa, lare, lare.

55:46.708 --> 55:51.577
After all, if you
wanna do something right,

55:51.579 --> 55:52.880
you gotta do it yourself.

55:52.882 --> 55:54.884
No! no, lare!

55:55.918 --> 55:57.050
No, Larry.

55:57.052 --> 55:58.485
Larry, give me the gun.

55:58.487 --> 56:00.153
Pass me the gun.
Get ahold of yourself.

56:00.155 --> 56:02.456
Give me the gun.
I'm gonna kill you.

56:02.458 --> 56:03.992
Give it to me!
Give it to me!

56:05.527 --> 56:06.895
No!

56:39.061 --> 56:40.396
It's okay.

56:57.045 --> 57:01.248
Gentlemen, a car will be traveling
down that road for a house call.

57:01.250 --> 57:03.684
Our objective
is to stop the car,

57:03.686 --> 57:05.985
apprehend the doctor
and the nurse,

57:05.987 --> 57:07.690
and terminate all others.

57:09.724 --> 57:12.528
Terminate? you mean...
You mean really kill?

57:14.762 --> 57:16.165
Let's build
a little roadblock.

57:22.670 --> 57:25.174
Oh, this is sharp.
Someone could get hurt.

57:29.644 --> 57:30.911
Someone's coming.

57:30.913 --> 57:32.215
Places.

58:13.989 --> 58:15.692
Keep an eye on the doctor.

58:50.291 --> 58:52.124
That's unfortunate.

58:52.126 --> 58:53.860
What's wrong?

58:53.862 --> 58:56.896
Didn't I tell you to keep
an eye on the doctor?

58:56.898 --> 58:59.768
We did. What, did you want us
to stop him, too?

59:09.711 --> 59:11.311
Put this on.

59:11.313 --> 59:12.715
What for?

59:14.083 --> 59:16.215
You're going to be his nurse.

59:16.217 --> 59:17.252
Me?

59:22.657 --> 59:24.391
You want to be famous,

59:24.393 --> 59:26.392
don't you?

59:26.394 --> 59:29.666
Besides, I'm the wrong gender
and skin tone.

59:31.900 --> 59:33.867
What, oh...
Excuse me, terrorist.

59:33.869 --> 59:35.869
Well, what about me?

59:35.871 --> 59:36.905
I have you covered.

59:41.110 --> 59:42.912
Put this on.

59:44.179 --> 59:46.847
"Human hair."

59:46.849 --> 59:48.248
I'll take care
of your complexion.

01:00:15.043 --> 01:00:16.309
You'll need to hide this

01:00:16.311 --> 01:00:17.747
on your person.

01:00:19.213 --> 01:00:21.882
Hide it? Hide it where?
I don't have any pockets.

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:23.686
Your bum makes a cozy place.

01:00:27.155 --> 01:00:29.092
- You want me to put that thing in...
- Uh-huh.

01:00:31.927 --> 01:00:33.793
It's really big.

01:00:33.795 --> 01:00:34.931
How do you suppose I...

01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:56.883
Keep in mind, Felix,

01:00:56.885 --> 01:00:58.688
one fart gets us all killed.

01:01:01.123 --> 01:01:02.456
I'll take
an exterior position.

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:04.423
Pussy, you stay here
and stop the doctor

01:01:04.425 --> 01:01:05.925
should you need to.

01:01:05.927 --> 01:01:07.262
Stop? stop how?

01:01:08.396 --> 01:01:09.963
By any means necessary.

01:01:09.965 --> 01:01:11.798
Whatever you do,

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.936
keep it quiet.

01:04:01.969 --> 01:04:04.403
I... I fell asleep.

01:04:08.376 --> 01:04:10.943
- Move.
- what's this for?

01:04:10.945 --> 01:04:12.347
Uh, okay.

01:05:21.182 --> 01:05:22.184
Smith!

01:05:24.186 --> 01:05:25.221
Go!

01:05:31.559 --> 01:05:33.094
You just shot that guy.

01:05:36.731 --> 01:05:38.534
Payback's a bitch,
isn't it?

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:04.693
Nice shot, Felix.

01:06:24.278 --> 01:06:25.447
We got him.

01:06:27.715 --> 01:06:29.749
We got him.

01:06:29.751 --> 01:06:31.988
Fucking a, we got him!

01:06:33.155 --> 01:06:34.487
We got him?

01:06:34.489 --> 01:06:36.391
Dude, we got him.

01:06:38.527 --> 01:06:40.559
I'm famous.

01:06:40.561 --> 01:06:41.693
I'm finally famous.

01:06:41.695 --> 01:06:43.695
You poor sack of shit,

01:06:43.697 --> 01:06:45.231
you're famous.

01:06:45.233 --> 01:06:46.633
We're all famous.

01:06:47.668 --> 01:06:50.269
Yes!

01:06:50.271 --> 01:06:51.704
Okay.

01:06:51.706 --> 01:06:53.009
So...

01:06:54.208 --> 01:06:56.708
What do we do now?

01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:58.278
We killed him.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.579
It's over.

01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:02.849
I know, dipshit.
What do we do now?

01:07:02.851 --> 01:07:05.517
What do you mean,
what do we do?

01:07:05.519 --> 01:07:07.554
How do we get him out of here?

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:09.088
D... do we call the newspaper?

01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:10.690
The FBI?

01:07:10.692 --> 01:07:12.559
Do we have the number
for the FBI?

01:07:12.561 --> 01:07:15.795
Looks like a good time
to tidy up a bit.

01:07:15.797 --> 01:07:17.199
Let's go.

01:07:21.635 --> 01:07:23.172
Shit.

01:07:25.206 --> 01:07:26.241
Wait, where...

01:07:28.742 --> 01:07:31.811
Wait, where you going? We can't
just leave him up there.

01:07:31.813 --> 01:07:34.282
Have you even thought
of an exit strategy?

01:07:36.251 --> 01:07:37.453
Uh...

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:41.624
You don't have
an exit strategy?

01:07:43.257 --> 01:07:45.260
Smith, can I use your phone?

01:07:47.728 --> 01:07:48.728
Ah.

01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:50.195
Smith,

01:07:50.197 --> 01:07:51.463
the phone works better

01:07:51.465 --> 01:07:53.133
when it's out of your pocket.

01:07:53.135 --> 01:07:54.166
I know, pussy.

01:07:54.168 --> 01:07:55.334
Unfortunately,

01:07:55.336 --> 01:07:56.668
my phone needs a charge.

01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:59.805
We just killed the most
wanted man on the earth.

01:07:59.807 --> 01:08:01.773
And now we can't share it
with anybody

01:08:01.775 --> 01:08:04.476
because we don't have
any battery power?

01:08:04.478 --> 01:08:06.778
Uh, I... I guess

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:08.648
we could wrap him up
in some sheets

01:08:08.650 --> 01:08:10.349
and then carry him outside

01:08:10.351 --> 01:08:13.355
and... and maybe try
and get a taxi.

01:08:15.356 --> 01:08:17.156
You're an asshole.

01:08:17.158 --> 01:08:19.392
You think that we
can just waltz out of here

01:08:19.394 --> 01:08:21.527
with that fucker
and hail a taxi?

01:08:21.529 --> 01:08:24.263
You don't deserve
to be famous!

01:08:24.265 --> 01:08:25.898
- Larry!
- you can stop now!

01:08:25.899 --> 01:08:27.368
What?

01:08:29.435 --> 01:08:30.803
Who are you?

01:08:30.805 --> 01:08:33.339
Well done, Smith.

01:08:33.341 --> 01:08:35.875
You done your country proud.

01:08:35.877 --> 01:08:38.544
Well, the hunters
have become the hunted.

01:08:38.546 --> 01:08:40.412
Burn these words
through your brain.

01:08:40.413 --> 01:08:43.417
Shut the fuck u...

01:09:02.569 --> 01:09:03.904
Sorry, Bob.

01:09:26.461 --> 01:09:27.960
You're back.

01:09:27.962 --> 01:09:30.662
W... where have you been?

01:09:30.663 --> 01:09:32.232
Well, we... we got out.

01:09:32.234 --> 01:09:34.236
I know. Wha... what happened?

01:09:38.805 --> 01:09:41.273
Nothing.

01:09:41.274 --> 01:09:45.877
But, you know what, I don't think i
want to be a household name anymore.

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:47.246
Well, that's progress.

01:09:47.247 --> 01:09:49.350
A good friend of mine...

01:09:50.652 --> 01:09:52.785
He once said,

01:09:52.787 --> 01:09:55.722
"there comes a time where you
have to take a good, hard look

01:09:55.724 --> 01:09:59.726
at the reality around you,

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:04.530
and everyone's always
telling me that I'm average,

01:10:04.532 --> 01:10:06.302
but I think I'm okay with it.

01:10:12.274 --> 01:10:14.410
So do you want to be famous?

01:10:19.447 --> 01:10:22.551
Nobody's ever asked me
that before.

01:10:24.485 --> 01:10:25.587
I am.

01:10:28.657 --> 01:10:32.625
I just think
i want to be happy.

01:10:32.627 --> 01:10:33.629
Marcus.

01:10:35.863 --> 01:10:37.332
Group therapy.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.031
Patient is contemplating
eating his feelings.

01:11:14.636 --> 01:11:16.936
What's up, bro?

01:11:16.938 --> 01:11:18.440
Hey.

01:11:25.512 --> 01:11:27.879
Well, boys,

01:11:27.881 --> 01:11:31.616
how does it feel to be back
in your natural habitat?

01:11:31.618 --> 01:11:33.052
Hey, I know you.

01:11:33.054 --> 01:11:34.120
You're...
you're agent mustang,

01:11:34.122 --> 01:11:35.987
the president's
right-hand man.

01:11:35.989 --> 01:11:39.125
Guys, do you know who this is?
This is the... this is the man

01:11:39.127 --> 01:11:41.561
who singlehandedly
took down osama...

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:46.432
Shit.

01:11:46.434 --> 01:11:48.968
Looks like a light bulb
just went off.

01:11:48.970 --> 01:11:51.704
Well, I believe Mr. Marcus'
recent epiphany

01:11:51.706 --> 01:11:54.139
is deeply rooted in overcoming
his family psychological...

01:11:54.141 --> 01:11:58.977
You must be the illustrious
Dr. Phil, I presume.

01:11:58.979 --> 01:12:00.646
Why... why, yes,

01:12:00.648 --> 01:12:03.018
my reputation
seems to precede me.

01:12:04.551 --> 01:12:06.852
If I may...

01:12:06.854 --> 01:12:08.787
Please allow me
to offer you

01:12:08.789 --> 01:12:11.590
a small token
of my gratitude.

01:12:11.592 --> 01:12:14.994
For your advanced intellect

01:12:14.996 --> 01:12:17.562
and unique insight.

01:12:17.564 --> 01:12:20.532
Why, I'd be honored.

01:12:20.534 --> 01:12:21.869
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

01:12:27.574 --> 01:12:30.108
Oh, come on.

01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:31.843
You can't fight pure genius.

01:12:31.845 --> 01:12:33.513
I knew that
when Smith got out,

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:35.915
he would lead you
right to jackpot.

01:12:35.917 --> 01:12:38.884
It was as easy
as taking candy from a baby.

01:12:38.886 --> 01:12:40.952
You won't get away
with this shit.

01:12:40.954 --> 01:12:42.655
Oh, but I already have.

01:12:42.657 --> 01:12:45.424
When you boys took
bin laden down,

01:12:45.426 --> 01:12:47.093
the legacy of our president

01:12:47.095 --> 01:12:50.729
remained intact.

01:12:50.731 --> 01:12:53.199
And as for yours truly,

01:12:53.201 --> 01:12:55.067
well...

01:12:55.069 --> 01:12:58.504
I get to remain
unbelievably famous.

01:12:58.506 --> 01:13:00.173
But the fact is

01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:02.008
that we killed bin laden,

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:04.443
and nothing's ever going
to change that.

01:13:04.445 --> 01:13:06.211
Oh, true.

01:13:06.213 --> 01:13:08.180
But it really doesn't matter,
does it?

01:13:08.182 --> 01:13:13.018
You see, what your deranged friend
over there never understood

01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:16.488
is that I'm the guy in charge.

01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:17.956
You know what that means?

01:13:17.958 --> 01:13:20.125
It means you're
a fucking prick.

01:13:20.127 --> 01:13:21.429
No.

01:13:22.663 --> 01:13:24.129
It means that you all
better get

01:13:24.131 --> 01:13:26.098
real comfortable
in here

01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:27.767
because I'm gonna make sure
you spend

01:13:27.769 --> 01:13:29.701
the rest
of your worthless lives

01:13:29.703 --> 01:13:31.536
drugged up in this asylum.

01:13:31.538 --> 01:13:33.141
You can't do this!
We...

01:13:35.042 --> 01:13:36.177
My, my...

01:13:37.645 --> 01:13:41.046
Such pent-up anger.

01:13:41.048 --> 01:13:44.549
Guess I'll have to prescribe
a little electroshock therapy

01:13:44.551 --> 01:13:46.154
for you and your friends.

01:13:50.524 --> 01:13:51.926
As for Smith...

01:13:53.528 --> 01:13:57.162
I'm gonna work up
a special cocktail

01:13:57.164 --> 01:13:58.798
to bring him down

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.168
permanently.

01:14:01.569 --> 01:14:03.505
What goes around comes around.

01:14:04.771 --> 01:14:06.938
Oh, keep thinking that,
Mr. Marcus.

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:09.541
Keep thinking.

01:14:09.543 --> 01:14:10.809
Who knows?

01:14:10.811 --> 01:14:13.044
Maybe your boys'll get
lucky again,

01:14:13.046 --> 01:14:15.580
and Smith'll help you find

01:14:15.582 --> 01:14:17.849
Elvis.

01:14:17.851 --> 01:14:19.220
Elv... the... the king?

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:30.666
I know where he is.

01:14:31.966 --> 01:14:34.703
You know where who is?

01:14:38.939 --> 01:14:40.541
Elvis Presley.
