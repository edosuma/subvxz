- Is there--um...

18:57.904 --> 19:00.271
You want to ease up
a little bit?

19:00.273 --> 19:01.873
- Look, pam, I don't know
what to tell you.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.275
I mean, what do I do?
It's gone.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.910
That moment's just gone.
I missed it.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.446
- I don't know, jim--maybe you
should have been there.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.448
- You're not serious,
right?

19:10.450 --> 19:12.517
I mean,
how is that fair?

19:12.519 --> 19:14.752
I'm in philly.
These are my days in philly.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.154
You've agreed to this.

19:16.156 --> 19:20.525
A conversation with me
about what's fair, okay?

19:20.527 --> 19:23.794
This is way more intense
than I ever--

19:23.796 --> 19:24.829
- Pam, I'm not explaining
this to you--

19:24.831 --> 19:26.430
Pam, I'm not going
over this again.

19:26.432 --> 19:28.499
I don't know how else--
- jim, we--we need you.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.934
- I don't know how else
to tell you, okay?

19:29.936 --> 19:32.737
I'm doing everything
I can every week

19:32.739 --> 19:34.472
To bring home something...
- I am--I am--

19:34.474 --> 19:35.873
- For our fam--
- I am trying to make everything

19:35.875 --> 19:39.877
So that you can have
everything that you want.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.479
- I'm doing this
just for me?

19:41.481 --> 19:43.481
Is that what I'm doing?
I'm doing it just for me.

19:43.483 --> 19:46.784
If that's what you think,
then this is a really sad night.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.886
But you know what?
I got to go.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.622
Okay?
- Yep.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.925
- We'll talk tomorrow?

19:53.927 --> 19:56.827
- Yep.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.563
- All right.
Great.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.264
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

20:00.266 --> 20:03.367
- Bye.

20:13.478 --> 20:16.814
[sniffles, cries]

20:16.816 --> 20:19.850
- Hey, you okay?

20:21.320 --> 20:23.821
- What am I doing wrong,
brian?

20:23.823 --> 20:25.556
- Nothing.
You're doing the best you can.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.791
- Brian.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.894
- Give her a minute.
Give her a minute.

20:29.896 --> 20:33.431
- [crying]

20:33.433 --> 20:36.834
- Hey, it's just
a tough situation, all right?

20:36.836 --> 20:38.869
- It's getting tougher.

20:38.871 --> 20:42.473
I just didn't know
that it was gonna be this hard.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.909
- Yeah.
Let's turn the cameras off.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.244
Seriously, guys.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.713
Enough.
Enough.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.749
- Thank you.

20:53.885 --> 20:55.019
- Fire in the hole!

20:55.021 --> 20:56.754
- [screams]

20:56.756 --> 20:58.589
- Go, go, go, go!

20:58.591 --> 21:01.926
[laughter]

21:01.928 --> 21:04.495
- I nailed that guy, dude.
- Oh, yeah.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.931
- And replay.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.666
- Thank you.

21:08.668 --> 21:11.936
Fire in the hole!
- [screams]

21:11.938 --> 21:13.671
- Go, go, go, go!
[laughter]

21:13.673 --> 21:15.706
- I nailed that guy, dude.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.942
- [sighs]

21:17.944 --> 21:21.045
I'm gonna miss
the paper business.
