Our species was once close to perfection.

00:29.480 --> 00:32.552
We knew diseases nor pain.

00:32.720 --> 00:37.476
But contact with people was the beginning of the end for my people.

00:39.120 --> 00:43.751
Our only chance of survival was to quickly attack.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.390
However, to provide, instead of the solution,

00:48.560 --> 00:51.678
ushered in a long war in our attack

00:51.840 --> 00:55.993
people brought to my planet, Cerulean.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.280

04:48.760 --> 04:52.117
We are attacked. Mayday. Mayday.

04:52.280 --> 04:55.990
Magellan, you hear me? We are attacked.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.913
Why is the link broken?

04:58.080 --> 05:00.436
Sergeant Green was hit by a bazooka.

05:00.600 --> 05:04.037
Precise position? - 40 km north of their target.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.920

05:32.120 --> 05:35.238
I know him. He is one of our best schuipschutters.

05:35.400 --> 05:39.713
Believe me, 37 hits is a low estimate. And Carpenter?

09:31.120 --> 09:33.112
Hou is taai.

09:56.120 --> 09:58.237
We have him. Wait for my signal.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.554
A subject is moving quickly towards the hills.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.111
Who is that? - That's Matthews.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.509
Follow him.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.474
Where did he go?

10:54.640 --> 10:56.552
Bring that rock formation image.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.952
Smart man. - What do you mean?

11:07.640 --> 11:10.235
Die Rots blocker hittesensoren.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.869
They can not locate him.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.236
What do we do now?

11:15.400 --> 11:17.710
Search Carpenter. - And Matthews?

11:17.880 --> 11:21.635
We know where he is. He trusts that we know.

16:39.320 --> 16:41.312
What was that? - What channel?

16:41.480 --> 16:43.039
Two. On the main screen.

16:43.360 --> 16:46.797
What have you seen? - A thermal. Rinse back.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.918
There. - Is it one of them?

16:54.560 --> 16:56.392
He greets us alone.

16:57.440 --> 17:01.150
I send the rescue bird. Target area between LZ 06 and LZ 09.

17:01.320 --> 17:04.757
It is too dangerous. Keep them ready until we know more.

17:04.920 --> 17:08.152
How long do we have received? - Another 60 minutes.

17:08.319 --> 17:11.438
I want to see as long as possible as much as possible.

18:06.840 --> 18:10.311
Enemies approaching Matthews' position.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.912
What happened?

19:02.320 --> 19:04.710
Three enemies less.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.359
What is that?

20:40.520 --> 20:42.591
It looks like a civilian vehicle.

20:43.440 --> 20:46.990
Give me the scan results. - They are online now.

20:48.320 --> 20:49.913
Who is that?

20:50.080 --> 20:52.436
The vehicle is Omar Karzchet.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.752
He is a Leckchat, a kind of frost.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.719
He secular and religious power.

20:58.040 --> 21:00.032
What's he doing there?

21:00.200 --> 21:03.511
Keep an eye on them. Return to Matthews.

22:57.640 --> 22:59.871
Six out of the flock are still missing.

23:00.320 --> 23:02.118
They can not be far away.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.712
Come on. Come check it out.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.240
What will we do?

23:20.720 --> 23:22.552
We must leave here.

23:24.520 --> 23:26.830
Come. That concerns us nothing.

24:06.560 --> 24:08.279
Kyle.

29:31.240 --> 29:32.720
Do not cry.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.876
Do not be afraid.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.993
How long will this injustice continue?

35:09.480 --> 35:11.278
What is the situation?

35:11.840 --> 35:14.799
We have every day a few hours no picture,

35:14.960 --> 35:17.759
every time the third moon is in the way.

35:17.920 --> 35:21.231
Any news? - Depends on how you look.

35:21.400 --> 35:23.278
Let's see then.

35:24.240 --> 35:28.120
Three kilometers from Matthews shelter.

35:28.440 --> 35:30.318
What should I see?

35:31.120 --> 35:33.954
I saw something move. Did you see it?

35:34.120 --> 35:36.351
Please zoom back in. And rinse

35:39.800 --> 35:42.759
That's our man. - But what is he up to?

35:44.000 --> 35:46.674
He explores something. But what?

35:46.840 --> 35:49.878
He goes into the ravine and we lost him.

35:50.040 --> 35:51.633
Wait.

35:51.800 --> 35:55.476
There is a thermal in the ravine by Matthews shelter.

35:55.640 --> 35:57.836
But I kept it for a scout.

35:58.680 --> 36:01.036
Does he have a taken hostage?

37:39.440 --> 37:41.591
The man in the red vehicle.

37:43.800 --> 37:45.314
I spoke to him.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.551
I promised him to send you back.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.718
I thought so.

37:58.200 --> 38:01.034
I know you speak the language of the earth.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.240
Please.

38:15.480 --> 38:18.120
Please do not bring me back.

38:19.360 --> 38:21.352
He will murder me.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.192
I will not return.

38:28.360 --> 38:30.079
I promise you.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.719
Dank them.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.280
Who is he?

38:43.200 --> 38:46.716
You are safe here. No one will hurt you.

38:49.640 --> 38:51.632
I hear him.

38:52.360 --> 38:54.795
I'm his property.

38:55.360 --> 38:57.955
And he is my owner.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.792
That's different with us.

39:20.680 --> 39:22.751
Close your eyes.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.792
Close your eyes.

39:40.560 --> 39:43.075
Think of someone you really love.

39:44.640 --> 39:46.871
How the sun shines on his face.

39:49.520 --> 39:52.160
And his smile when he knows you're there.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.280
Dank them.

40:12.240 --> 40:14.232
You can look at me best.

40:15.240 --> 40:17.596
Sorry, but this is forbidden.

40:18.400 --> 40:21.552
Who forbids it? You God?

40:22.120 --> 40:24.316
Or men like you owner?

40:27.600 --> 40:31.480
Why would God give your eyes and take away the freedom to see?

40:32.200 --> 40:36.035
This site should you do what you want.

40:36.360 --> 40:38.636
I am your protector.

40:42.520 --> 40:44.239
Maybe I am mistaken.

40:44.560 --> 40:47.155
Maybe I'm too ugly to look at.

41:06.160 --> 41:08.311
We have something in common.

41:09.480 --> 41:11.597
We both escaped death.

41:13.320 --> 41:15.471
But death surrounds us.

41:18.360 --> 41:20.158
Do you know this area?

41:21.720 --> 41:24.918
25 kilometers southwest of Bulkav there is a people basis.

41:25.240 --> 41:28.233
My men and I were on our way there.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.198
Do you know where it is?

41:32.680 --> 41:34.876
I'm from Belahzerkva.

41:37.360 --> 41:40.876
My owner has been driving to get here.

41:42.680 --> 41:44.672
I do not know where we are.

41:55.600 --> 41:58.911
We can not stay here. We have hardly any food and water

41:59.240 --> 42:01.994
and we need to create at least two ambushes.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.635
The heat signal came from these ruins.

44:10.080 --> 44:11.480
Pas op.

44:19.440 --> 44:22.831
You must Commandant, see this. - What is it?

44:23.320 --> 44:26.233
Someone has slain six fighters with a fall.

45:05.760 --> 45:07.991
There is movement. - Main.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.597
There. I see him.

45:12.880 --> 45:16.635
The signal is weak. He camouflaged himself well.

45:33.600 --> 45:35.592
ls dat Matthews?

45:36.080 --> 45:37.912
We think so.

45:38.080 --> 45:40.231
He hid the bodies.

45:40.400 --> 45:43.199
We Once the coast is clear she mountains.

45:44.720 --> 45:48.600
Al heard from Carpenter? - No, he's like a ghost.

45:48.760 --> 45:53.232
We thought to see something a few times, but he will not be found.

45:53.400 --> 45:57.394
Keep trying. We bring the boys back home.

46:01.840 --> 46:03.593
Listen well.

46:04.360 --> 46:06.511
You have something of mine. I will find it.

46:06.840 --> 46:08.877
And I will kill you all.

46:47.160 --> 46:49.356
lk heet Mirra.

46:53.880 --> 46:55.360
Kyle.

47:03.320 --> 47:06.996
Do you hate the rock?

47:08.360 --> 47:10.431
I hunt enemy soldiers.

47:12.800 --> 47:15.474
I know exactly where and how many there are.

47:16.160 --> 47:18.720
Each notch is one less worry.

47:20.160 --> 47:23.312
Maybe for you, but not for their families.

47:28.720 --> 47:31.792
If I do not kill them, they kill me.

47:32.800 --> 47:34.598
Is it that simple?

47:37.120 --> 47:39.077
It's my job to shoot.

47:39.400 --> 47:42.472
Unfortunately for them I am very good at it.

47:44.360 --> 47:46.511
After all I've seen ...

47:46.680 --> 47:49.593
I saw my best friend die before my eyes.

47:49.920 --> 47:54.278
And to know that I could be next ... Nothing's worse than that.

47:54.600 --> 47:57.115
Why do you do it?

48:00.840 --> 48:03.230
I have kind studied.

48:03.560 --> 48:06.314
I know more than you realize.

48:06.880 --> 48:08.439
Echt? - I am.

48:08.760 --> 48:11.753
I your culture, know your traditions,

48:12.440 --> 48:14.830
your self-destructive nature.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.480
Mens.

48:18.640 --> 48:21.553
I know you have the corpse of the woman Ceruleaanse.

48:21.880 --> 48:23.678
You must be a sadist.

48:24.000 --> 48:28.279
Like the rest of your species, you have no respect for the dead.

48:28.440 --> 48:30.477
What can you care about the body?

48:31.840 --> 48:35.800
Her owner is an influential man of noble birth.

48:35.960 --> 48:38.191
You're stupid if you trust him.

48:38.960 --> 48:41.600
I want to give her a proper burial.

48:41.760 --> 48:43.956
I am willing to do business.

48:44.840 --> 48:47.196
You have nothing I want.

48:47.360 --> 48:48.999
I have something.

48:49.160 --> 48:52.278
A metal object that you hang around your neck.

48:52.440 --> 48:54.352
That's a fair exchange, right?

48:54.520 --> 48:57.354
What do you have to keep it a corpse?

48:57.520 --> 49:00.592
There is no body, just a woman Ceruleaanse

49:00.920 --> 49:04.357
which was almost executed by its own owner.

49:05.880 --> 49:07.792
Depending lies, mens.

49:07.960 --> 49:09.792
You do not believe me.

49:09.960 --> 49:12.600
I do not deliver her killers.

49:13.320 --> 49:15.312
And do not try to find me.

49:16.080 --> 49:17.753
I will find you.

49:18.840 --> 49:21.071
Do not wait on you.

49:34.400 --> 49:36.790
Stay with me if you want to stay alive.

49:44.840 --> 49:47.639
Where did you get your nature knowledge and our language learned?

49:48.480 --> 49:52.315
My mother took me in when I was little.

49:53.240 --> 49:54.959
ln the secret?

49:57.120 --> 50:01.114
When I was six, I found an old book.

50:02.120 --> 50:04.954
I took it home, opened the

50:05.280 --> 50:08.079
and tried to pronounce the words.

50:08.840 --> 50:10.911
My mother found me with the book.

50:11.240 --> 50:15.393
I see the fear in her eyes before me when she waned me the book.

50:15.720 --> 50:19.919
I had her promise never to tell my owner.

50:20.080 --> 50:23.994
A few days later she gave me secretly a note.

50:25.440 --> 50:28.956
The note was the human alphabet

50:29.120 --> 50:31.476
and Ceruleaanse translation.

50:31.800 --> 50:34.520
I soon learned it from my mind.

50:36.240 --> 50:40.598
My mother found many ways to give me secretly lesson.

50:41.760 --> 50:46.357
When I was in was good, they gave me the book.

50:47.040 --> 50:51.080
I read it over and over again until I knew it by heart.

50:51.400 --> 50:56.555
I was obsessed with all people book

50:56.720 --> 50:59.280
paper or quote that I could find.

50:59.440 --> 51:02.194
And you managed to keep this secret for your own?

51:03.480 --> 51:07.838
He has everything found and destroyed.

51:11.040 --> 51:13.714
See the notes from my mother fires

51:14.040 --> 51:18.319
did more than the beating he gave me later pain.

51:21.920 --> 51:24.515
I was so ashamed

51:24.680 --> 51:27.195
because I had my owner brought shame.

51:27.360 --> 51:30.990
He recently discovered that I've never stopped it.

51:31.160 --> 51:33.356
Maybe I deserve death.

51:36.160 --> 51:39.278
I know what it means to kill someone.

51:40.920 --> 51:45.039
Every time you kill someone dies a part of yourself.

51:45.800 --> 51:48.190
Soon there is nothing good about it.

51:49.280 --> 51:50.714
Do not forget that Mirra.

51:52.200 --> 51:54.635
What your owner did is unforgivable.

51:57.280 --> 52:00.318
I protect and defend.

52:00.480 --> 52:01.914
What he did is murder.

52:03.840 --> 52:06.878
We must go. The sun rises later on.

53:28.560 --> 53:30.597
How's your shoulder?

53:39.880 --> 53:41.792
Here, take it.

53:41.960 --> 53:45.158
I can not. We are different.

53:46.240 --> 53:49.472
My system bumped the previous tablet that you gave me.

53:50.200 --> 53:52.715
It is a medicine for the pain.

53:52.880 --> 53:56.760
For you, but our bodies are not. Tolerate your resources

53:56.920 --> 53:58.912
We heal themselves.

53:59.240 --> 54:03.598
Previously it was faster, but since we have contact with people

54:03.920 --> 54:07.550
began to deteriorate our systems.

54:08.600 --> 54:10.751
How to cure you then?

54:13.520 --> 54:15.193
Door magie.

54:15.520 --> 54:16.636
Magic?

54:19.680 --> 54:22.991
I'm very disappointed in you, Antarah.

54:23.960 --> 54:26.998
How have I failed?

54:28.440 --> 54:30.830
Where is the body?

54:32.240 --> 54:35.551
We have yet to find the man.

54:35.720 --> 54:38.360
ldioot. The body in the ravine.

54:38.520 --> 54:41.194
The body that I forbade you to touch.

54:41.880 --> 54:44.156
The man has hair.

54:44.320 --> 54:47.154
He claims that she's alive.

54:48.800 --> 54:51.599
If you've caught that human brood,

54:52.080 --> 54:54.197
the woman. please bring me

55:02.920 --> 55:05.071
Why did you save me?

55:06.080 --> 55:08.311
You remind me of someone.

55:09.360 --> 55:13.434
Someone a second chance deserved but never received.

55:17.240 --> 55:19.709
I wish you were my own.

55:24.280 --> 55:28.354
Would not you like me? - That's not it.

55:31.840 --> 55:35.117
We do not. Have each

55:35.880 --> 55:39.794
We married. Did you read about that?

55:40.680 --> 55:42.194
Yes, something.

55:43.400 --> 55:47.394
Were you ever married? - Yes. Ever.

55:48.640 --> 55:50.279
Is there something wrong?

55:55.000 --> 55:58.994
I am sorry I will not talk about it.

56:00.080 --> 56:03.994
She is the woman I see before me when I close my eyes.

56:05.480 --> 56:06.470
Sarah.

56:08.440 --> 56:12.320
We were heading to the doctor when the invasion began.

56:13.480 --> 56:15.597
We would have a son.

56:18.960 --> 56:20.952
It's been a long time ago.

56:24.360 --> 56:26.431
When you helped me ...

56:28.040 --> 56:30.714
When you asked me to close my eyes ...

56:32.160 --> 56:34.231
... I thought of my mother.

56:35.760 --> 56:37.672
It's weird.

56:38.920 --> 56:42.072
I now understand something she once told me.

56:42.240 --> 56:45.631
She told me that we are free to choose,

56:45.960 --> 56:48.429
but that we are bound by what is selected. his

56:52.680 --> 56:55.878
My choices have led me here.

56:57.600 --> 57:00.752
If I had never taken that book,

57:01.840 --> 57:03.752
I would have never met.

58:31.720 --> 58:33.598
Do you see that?

58:33.760 --> 58:35.592
On the main screen.

58:35.760 --> 58:38.116
Why do they make him just wondering?

58:38.280 --> 58:40.590
Is alive he is worth more dead.

58:42.400 --> 58:43.880
Launch the bird.

58:47.400 --> 58:50.950
lndrukwekkend weapon. A SL9.

58:51.280 --> 58:54.637
Incredibly accurate even at 2100 meters.

58:55.720 --> 58:58.360
I heard de.408 bullets fly faster

58:58.520 --> 59:01.957
and with ball. over een.50 caliber power

59:03.600 --> 59:05.239
Why are you here, man?

59:06.200 --> 59:08.999
Your rebellion is almost over.

59:09.960 --> 59:13.237
Have you so easily fooled by the propaganda of the few?

59:13.400 --> 59:16.552
You are mistaken in me, my people and our beliefs.

59:16.880 --> 59:19.270
You essentially change our prejudices and ideals.

59:19.600 --> 59:22.274
Your ideals are worth fighting.

59:22.440 --> 59:26.753
But those ideals are only a mask of a hypocritical nation.

59:29.560 --> 59:32.029
A chilling weapon, right?

59:33.160 --> 59:38.030
The size and shape of the blade made for stabbing,

59:39.320 --> 59:41.437
threading and kill.

59:42.400 --> 59:45.393
I know the wounds that makes such a weapon.

59:45.560 --> 59:48.678
After almost a year on your planet have fought

59:48.840 --> 59:50.559
I came home.

59:50.880 --> 59:53.600
I found my child lying in the street,

59:53.760 --> 59:57.390
stabbed by a soldier or other people.

59:58.200 --> 59:59.680
That was not me.

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:04.396
My wife with the same weapon slaughtered.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.439
She was like an animal eroded

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:09.434
and then shot through her head.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:18.634
I promise I will not rest

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:21.793
is wiped out to the last man.

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.835
Please.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.154
His wife and child are murdered too.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:45.397
You are brave. You risk your life for this man after all.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.836
He has not caused your suffering.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.151
He understands it. He made it himself.

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.357
He speaks the truth.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.837
Why else has he saved me?

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.960
I see truth in your eyes.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:08.876
You're not the darkness that all people see in us.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.111
You fight for our freedom.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:17.398
You'll live, I promise you.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:22.078
But the bloodshed that this man-made must be punished.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.718
No.

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.511
Hit it, soldier. I give coverage.

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.680
Keep going right.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.680
Naar links.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.754
There are a lot of mines in the open field.

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.992
You almost said "boom!"

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.190
I know a shelter. Hurry up.

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.392
I thought you were dead.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:29.830
p?

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:34.350
I'm like an STD. From me you will not print.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.280
Both life. Matthews has someone with him.

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.955
Give me the AZ-12 pilot. I want an arrival.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.272
Ze Zeiden net 50 minutes.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:50.798
That was 30 minutes ago. I want to talk to him now.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:55.273
The rescue bird waiting for orders. - The pilot is on the line.

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:58.160
Dit is commandant Gibson.
Wees realistisch.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.391
Can you get there undetected?

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.758
I want to go there, sir, but the flak is too strong.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.719
The probability that we lose the bird. Is large

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:09.634
Break the surgery, but stay ready.

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:13.510
I knew just to escape before the missile insloeg.

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:17.435
And da's just as well, otherwise I have been dead.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.320
That explosion was definitely your work?

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.831
Who is the woestijnkoningin?

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.880
I am responsible for her.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:33.280
Your safety is my first priority.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.557
We have lost enough men.

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.317
I'll take you home. Clear?

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.154
I am, sir.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:44.270
Where are you going? - The shelter monitor.

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:48.229
I will find the position of the enemy and give us firepower.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.792
Is he safe?

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.159
Can we trust him?

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.358
One hundred percent.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.920
Kyle?

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:43.958
Alles in orde, Mirra.

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.438
It's just Jason.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:27.280
I give them a taste of their own medicine.

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:31.919
This baby shows very Cerulea shake.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.311
Have a flight?

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:37.757
I know where to go, but I know of no safe route.

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:42.351
See those mountains in the west? - Yes.

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:45.994
We follow that mountain range to the south.

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:49.039
Thus we should be able to come unseen.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.680
That sounds good.

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:55.913
Here, take it. It is the last, so be careful with it.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.311
For you, not your girlfriend.

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:03.118
Their drones follow a standard route.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.749
They come every half hour passed.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:12.673
When the coast is clear, we go to the border. But take this first.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:15.480
We explore the area to be sure.

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.597
500 meters north is a ridge.

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:22.720
There you have three hours of shade. I explore the south side.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.117
Check.
- Gecheckt.

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.472
Always stay cool.

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:38.351
More food we have. Eat every few hours a bit.

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:42.513
Ga weg them?

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.840
We need to explore the area and avoid the heat.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.038
Stay in the shade. We are back soon.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:54.832
I have just arrived, you hear me?

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.433
I hear you.

01:08:58.439 --> 01:09:00.875
Remember our second broadcast?

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:05.395
We were surrounded, and you put your gun on quiet

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:09.712
and they popped one by one, head shot after head shot.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:13.154
What did you say after all those head shots?

01:09:13.479 --> 01:09:16.551
Headless no headaches. - Exactly.

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.156
Headless no headaches.

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:23.394
I know of no one better with a rifle than you.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:27.679
Unfortunately, I sit in the wilderness without my survival weapon.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.675
Okay, time to focus. Stay alert.

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.194
Understood.

01:09:46.359 --> 01:09:48.511
There's something moving. - Commander?

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:51.798
We're going to get them. First the bomber, then the bird.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:55.670
We have a further 30 minutes sight. - I have the AZ12-Pilot.

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:58.639
Estimated time of arrival? - Over 40 minutes, sir.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.477
Good. Good luck, soldier.

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:04.712
Make sure to touch. Commander, over.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.598
Say the rescue bird that there is an AZ12 bomber go.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.560
The area is dangerous and there are comrades.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.914
I am.

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:34.840
Why did you leave the shelter? - There were soldiers.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.798
Come on.

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.078
Jason, can you hear me?

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.232
Jason. Do you hear me?

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.917
It is teeming with enemies.

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:25.831
We have a strange job.

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.431
We need to kill without question.

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:33.634
When we get home says society:

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:38.035
"Thanks for the killing, but remember that killing is bad."

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.839
As if we could just turn a knob.

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:46.314
Only soldiers understand what we are undergoing.

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.389
We offeren alles op,

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.472
mind, body and soul.

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:55.317
Yes, sacrifices must be made.

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:02.154
Dank them.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:06.960
I think not.

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.111
It's like when you fly.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:17.431
First you put your own mask on.

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.398
Do not worry about her.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:24.274
The struggle for survival is a key

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:27.000
to the true potential of man.

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:31.679
We chained ourselves with fear and our shortcomings,

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.400
but only when death stares us in the eyes ...

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:37.672
That is the turning point.

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:42.271
I saw it for the first time in Jersey when I was eleven.

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:46.838
I just bought some junk food in a store.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.994
When a homeless person came in and he smelled of death.

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.634
He walked to the cashier, grabbed a gun

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:57.315
and shot him through the head.

01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.358
I stood rooted to the ground.

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:03.400
He took the money and ran towards me.

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:07.156
His eyes were cold as death. Without repentance.

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:10.640
He grabbed my junk and left.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:14.360
I did not know why he did not kill me.

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.911
But now I understand.

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:20.156
Every thought, moral or not,

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:24.200
has to bow to the sheer survival instinct.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:29.197
Are difficult choices when that happens, easy.

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.713
And the impossible ...

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.398
... Is suddenly possible.

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.391
Do not worry. The poison is not fatal.

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:46.711
It's incredible what grows here.

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:53.832
What are you planning?

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:01.957
I know you can not make tough decisions.

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.959
But I do.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.471
You'll betray our position.

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:18.120
That's what you already did.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.514
Kyle.

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:51.000
Kyle.

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:29.710
Kyle.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:51.232
How does it feel to betray your people?

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.352
We gotta get outta here. Right now

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.753
Like them.

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:24.718
What happened?

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:28.440
Sir?

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.352
Carpenter is dood.

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:35.549
Only Matthews and wife were with him.

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:39.475
I know. - Another minute to satellite contact.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.880
The bomber does not make it before we lose the picture.

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.352
Call the bomber back.

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:52.397
Matthews just need to save themselves until we sight again.

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.390
lnformeer me when we picture.

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:10.392
ln the storm we escape them.

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.350
Kyle?

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:25.478
When did you sleep last?

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.280
Not everyone needs sleep sir.

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:32.473
What happened between Carpenter and Matthews?

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:36.031
Matthews is a good soldier, he can explain to us.

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:38.875
I have freak. - Send it to my screen.

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:58.714
The civilian vehicle a few days ago.

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:01.349
They are Matthews and his traveling companion.

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:04.957
They are close to our base at LZ 17.

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.352
Hands high.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.757
We do not want trouble.

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.438
Stay there.

01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:26.393
I got her back.

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:29.991
Do not lie, man. I know everything.

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:33.597
You saved her for her fate. She does not deserve to live.

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:36.036
Here you will be hands chopped off for.

01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:37.190
Enough.

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:40.672
I will drag you with fun romp through my village.

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:41.956
Scum.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.756
I will soon be your naughty eyes protrude.

01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:30.120
Kyle.

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:34.796
I need to ask him something, now I can talk freely.

01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:46.958
Why did you want me, your property, kill?

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:50.272
You have taught me and cared for me when I was sick.

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:53.274
I remember that, and more.

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:58.310
But you're blind. You were no longer mine when you were resisting me.

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:02.356
You let the poison of men flowing in your veins.

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:06.198
I ask you: How could you do this to me?

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:11.358
Take your gun and destroy what you have dishonored.

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:14.515
Do not listen to him, Mirra.

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:19.031
I see it mensengif works fast.

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:24.240
Let yourself be influenced by that foolish?

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.835
I'm sorry, Mirra. He deserves death.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.993
If I do not kill him, he kills us both.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.469
Is killing the only answer?

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:42.598
If you kill someone dies a part of yourself.

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:45.275
Soon there is nothing good about it.

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:48.197
There is still good in you.

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:03.389
I want you to know.

01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:08.877
What you have done to me is unforgivable.

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:14.511
But I forgive you anyway.

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:12.432
There is another person.

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:16.117
A kilometer away. It can be a sniper.

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.193
The rescue bird is almost there.

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:29.354
Take Matthews on board. Bring him home.

01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:11.753
