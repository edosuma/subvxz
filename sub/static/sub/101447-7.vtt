00:07.882 --> 00:12.303
Your Honor, my husband has chosen
his career over his obligations

00:12.387 --> 00:14.806
as a spouse and as a father.

00:14.889 --> 00:19.102
He's so absent that I had to bring
my mother from the Philippines.

00:19.185 --> 00:20.645
I'm doing the best that I can.

00:20.729 --> 00:24.399
Mr. Bañaga, I see you have neglected
to hire counsel?

00:27.610 --> 00:29.029
That's right, Your Honor. I--

00:29.529 --> 00:30.405
I was unable to.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.282
If it pleases the court,

00:32.365 --> 00:35.577
while I understand that my wife feels
that I have been neglectful

00:35.660 --> 00:36.745
as a husband and a father,

00:36.828 --> 00:39.914
I would like to give these proceedings
some context

00:39.998 --> 00:44.627
which will, I hope, convince my wife
to drop this divorce petition,

00:44.711 --> 00:46.796
for the sake of our daughter, Marisol.

00:47.338 --> 00:48.965
For the past year and a half,

00:49.049 --> 00:53.261
I have volunteered my services
to citizens of Japanese descent

00:53.344 --> 00:56.222
who were sent to various internment camps
across the country

00:56.306 --> 00:59.017
under Executive Order 9066.

00:59.100 --> 01:03.146
Many in these camps are separated
from their families, sent to other camps.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.732
And these people, American citizens,

01:05.815 --> 01:08.276
display profound psychological distress.

01:08.359 --> 01:11.404
So do the children
they are forced to leave behind.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.281
I find it somewhat ironic, Doctor,

01:13.865 --> 01:18.495
that you're so concerned about Jap parents
being separated from their kids,

01:18.578 --> 01:21.915
but not at all concerned about
you being separated from your own.

01:22.457 --> 01:23.625
I'm finding for the plaintiff.

01:23.708 --> 01:25.919
Mrs. Bañaga, divorce is granted,

01:26.002 --> 01:27.837
along with full custody of your daughter.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.131
Wait!

01:30.215 --> 01:32.300
-Please! That's my daughter!

01:32.383 --> 01:33.218
Daddy!

01:33.301 --> 01:35.553
Let me say goodbye to her, please!
Marisol!

01:39.015 --> 01:40.016
I'm so sorry.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.978
I will provide for you, you understand?
I promise.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.230
It's over!

01:45.730 --> 01:46.898
-I love you!
- Daddy!

01:58.576 --> 02:00.370
Do come in, Dr. Bañaga.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.338
-For you.
-Thank you.

02:10.839 --> 02:11.673
Come in.

02:13.883 --> 02:17.929
First of all, I'd like to thank you
for allowing me to meet your son.

02:18.012 --> 02:19.722
I... He's a charming boy.

02:19.973 --> 02:20.807
Thank you.

02:21.516 --> 02:23.059
Really very intelligent,

02:23.143 --> 02:25.061
and he seemed to be in quite a good mood.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.981
He burned the cook today.
Did he tell you that?

02:29.732 --> 02:33.027
He heated up a spoon over the stove
till it was white-hot

02:33.111 --> 02:34.654
and put it back in the drawer.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.783
Consuelo has third-degree burns
on her hands.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.702
That's why he's in such a good mood.

02:41.578 --> 02:42.453
It's a clown.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.331
It's a clown, he's bleeding.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.793
<i>Your son is ill,</i>
<i>Mrs. Osgood. That much is plain.</i>

02:50.837 --> 02:52.881
Two penises...

02:53.464 --> 02:54.299
severed.

02:54.841 --> 02:58.136
The isolation,
the extreme fits of violence.

02:58.219 --> 03:01.347
And the pleasure
he appears to derive from it.

03:01.806 --> 03:02.682
And you?

03:06.853 --> 03:08.146
Can you treat him?

03:09.439 --> 03:10.273
Please sit down.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.822
I take my oath as a physician
very seriously.

03:19.157 --> 03:22.702
I've sacrificed everything for it.

03:25.079 --> 03:28.082
So I will not deceive you, Mrs. Osgood.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.962
No matter what financial incentive
there may be for me to do so.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.927
A new day is dawning
on the science of the human mind.

03:39.010 --> 03:42.555
All over the world,
astounding new techniques are emerging

03:42.639 --> 03:45.225
that repudiate everything
we thought we knew.

03:48.102 --> 03:49.729
The behavior your son exhibits...

03:52.190 --> 03:53.233
The violence.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.778
The delight in harming others, these...

03:58.738 --> 04:00.073
These are not his illness.

04:01.783 --> 04:02.825
They are but symptoms.

04:03.326 --> 04:06.246
His illness, whatever it may be...

04:07.330 --> 04:09.958
remains cloistered deep in his psyche.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.085
And my job would be to find it...

04:13.086 --> 04:14.045
diagnose it...

04:15.672 --> 04:16.506
and treat it.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.676
So to answer your question....

04:21.177 --> 04:22.512
I will not treat your son.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.058
I will cure him.

05:53.644 --> 05:54.479
Mildred.

05:55.980 --> 05:56.898
Nurse Ratched.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.483
Mildred's just fine, Huck.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.401
I wanted to see how you were doing...

06:01.235 --> 06:03.488
after what happened at the dance
and everything,

06:03.571 --> 06:05.448
we-- we haven't been able to catch up.

06:05.531 --> 06:06.366
Thank you.

06:08.284 --> 06:09.285
I'm doing all right.

06:11.871 --> 06:12.705
You?

06:12.789 --> 06:14.290
No, I'm fine.

06:15.416 --> 06:16.959
Thanks. No complaints.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.046
Good.

06:21.422 --> 06:24.592
Actually, there is one thing,
not a complaint, really, just...

06:25.635 --> 06:26.469
Well, when...

06:27.804 --> 06:29.180
something happens like that...

06:30.973 --> 06:31.808
Violence...

06:31.891 --> 06:34.977
And it could have just as easily been you
who got shot instead of Miss Briggs.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.647
It kind of puts things into perspective,
doesn't it?

06:38.231 --> 06:41.109
And so I got to thinking,
you know... uh...

06:41.901 --> 06:44.904
there is something I don't really have
in my life and...

06:46.697 --> 06:47.532
that's a...

06:49.075 --> 06:50.243
That's a sweetheart.

06:51.536 --> 06:52.787
So, I guess what I'm...

06:53.579 --> 06:55.289
wondering is if, uh...

06:57.208 --> 06:58.584
I could take you out sometime.

06:58.668 --> 07:02.171
Only if that sounds like something
you thought might be nice.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.256
Huck.

07:05.049 --> 07:06.592
I get it. I'm sorry.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.262
No. Huck, please, stop.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.889
It isn't that I don't find you appealing.

07:13.349 --> 07:16.310
You are a wonderful man, Huck.

07:17.478 --> 07:18.938
You're a real-life hero.

07:20.857 --> 07:21.691
But...

07:25.361 --> 07:27.280
I'm coming to understand that...

07:27.947 --> 07:29.657
I might be the kind of person...

07:34.162 --> 07:35.246
The kind of woman...

07:37.832 --> 07:39.292
who enjoys the company...

07:41.836 --> 07:42.962
of other women.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.716
If you take my meaning.

07:49.552 --> 07:50.386
Oh.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.222
I would appreciate it
if you didn't tell anyone.

07:53.723 --> 07:54.599
Of course.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.060
I wouldn't breathe a word of it.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.521
You will find love, Huck.

08:01.397 --> 08:05.568
Some girl who's gonna love you
in the way that you deserve.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.281
It's...

08:12.033 --> 08:13.326
it ain't love so much.

08:16.370 --> 08:18.623
I don't know if that's what I'm missing,
I mean, I'm...

08:19.248 --> 08:21.375
I don't know that I have purpose.

08:24.837 --> 08:25.671
Huck.

08:26.964 --> 08:27.798
Huck.

08:28.716 --> 08:29.967
Don't you worry, Mildred.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.345
Your secret's safe with me.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.725
Well, I gotta say, Louise,

08:37.808 --> 08:39.769
I have underestimated you.

08:41.062 --> 08:44.774
Here I thought you were some blowsy,
alcoholic jazz baby,

08:44.857 --> 08:47.443
and it turns out
you're a prize-winning truffle pig.

08:48.569 --> 08:49.445
Don't I know it.

08:49.946 --> 08:53.199
You should have seen me,
scurrying into her room

08:53.282 --> 08:55.826
after she left for the dance,
just like you said.

08:56.410 --> 09:01.999
<i>I was rooting through her things</i>
<i>like a junkie sniffing around for smack.</i>

09:02.083 --> 09:04.627
<i>Ohh, it was well worth it.</i>

09:05.503 --> 09:09.840
By the way, that pimento loaf you gave me
was so divine.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.384
I gotta have the recipe.

09:11.467 --> 09:12.969
Sure. Sure.

09:13.844 --> 09:15.846
Now that I don't understand.

09:17.265 --> 09:20.434
It's just a lot of telephone numbers,
or notes.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.687
And somewhere
there's a hand-drawn map,

09:22.770 --> 09:25.439
and it looks like
a man's handwriting to me.

09:25.523 --> 09:28.985
I'm no detective, mind you,
but I'm thinking maybe...

09:29.986 --> 09:31.279
I missed my calling.

09:31.362 --> 09:36.033
Now those really threw me for a loop.

09:36.117 --> 09:40.204
Why is this skirt so obsessed
with a mass murderer?

09:40.288 --> 09:42.039
Is she some kind of pervert,

09:42.665 --> 09:43.749
or something?

09:47.670 --> 09:48.629
But then,

09:48.713 --> 09:50.631
<i>I looked under the bed.</i>

09:52.925 --> 09:53.968
What is that?

09:54.051 --> 09:55.219
A recorder!

09:55.303 --> 09:57.597
-You talk and it records you--
-I know what a recorder is.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.848
Just help me with it.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.516
- Give it to me.

10:00.600 --> 10:05.646
Our friend Nurse Ratched
knows how to turn it on.

10:06.147 --> 10:09.233
Not so proficient
at knowing how to turn it off.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.235
She recorded a very...

10:12.653 --> 10:17.950
informative exchange
with a certain gentleman.

10:18.367 --> 10:23.080
Oh, no. I have no interest in listening
to Mildred Ratched fornicate.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.250
No, it's not that kind of exchange.

10:26.834 --> 10:31.005
The gentleman in question is a priest.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.766
Don't panic.
This isn't what it looks like.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.727
Oh, well, this<i> is</i> what it looks like.

10:46.562 --> 10:48.731
Close the door and sit, please.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.422
I think I can help you,

11:13.881 --> 11:16.967
but we're going to need to start
being honest with each other.

11:23.557 --> 11:24.892
I listened to the tape.

11:26.560 --> 11:27.770
<i>You see, Father...</i>

11:29.397 --> 11:31.190
<i>Edmund Tolleson is my brother.</i>

11:32.608 --> 11:33.984
<i>He wasn't born a monster.</i>

11:35.319 --> 11:36.696
<i>Somebody turned him into one.</i>

11:41.701 --> 11:43.119
<i>God bless you, Father.</i>

11:45.454 --> 11:47.623
I know what a lobotomy sounds like,
Mildred.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.334
The hammer on the ice pick.

11:51.252 --> 11:55.965
The-- The wet cracking sound as it pierces
the skull and enters the frontal lobe.

12:01.262 --> 12:04.557
That's why you came to the hospital,
I presume. Hm?

12:05.099 --> 12:06.392
To save your brother.

12:07.309 --> 12:09.186
Which, you know,
is understandable, I guess.

12:09.687 --> 12:13.733
Though, performing a lobotomy
on a man whose only crime was

12:13.816 --> 12:16.861
surviving an encounter
with Edmund Tolleson?

12:17.570 --> 12:20.030
That's a little harder
to wrap one's head around.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.242
I'm not the only person
who knows, Mildred.

12:24.201 --> 12:27.288
So if something were to happen to me,
if I went missing...

12:28.038 --> 12:31.917
well, then that other party would take
this information to the police.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.337
Which I have not done.

12:36.922 --> 12:37.757
As of yet.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.235
I'm so tired...

12:59.028 --> 13:00.404
of all the running

13:00.488 --> 13:02.114
and all the lying.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.244
The things I've done.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.915
I know the difference
between right and wrong,

13:10.998 --> 13:13.959
and still I've done things
that even I cannot believe.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.512
He's my brother.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.556
We were treated like animals.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.060
Worse than animals,
and he saved me from it.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.146
He saved my life.

13:35.731 --> 13:37.566
So I made a promise to myself

13:37.650 --> 13:42.488
that I would do <i>whatever</i> <i>it took</i>
to repay him for that kindness.

13:43.197 --> 13:44.198
To free him...

13:45.741 --> 13:48.828
...from a fate I knew he didn't deserve,
no matter what he'd done.

13:51.038 --> 13:53.499
Now I don't know what I think he deserves.

13:53.582 --> 13:54.458
Well...

13:55.417 --> 13:57.086
he shouldn't be put to death.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.340
And that's what's coming to him, for sure.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.009
But someone like Edmund should be studied.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.596
Killing him doesn't serve anybody.

14:10.182 --> 14:13.018
You've been lying a long time, Mildred.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.612
Listening to that recording
brought to mind

14:23.696 --> 14:26.615
all the suspicions I had about you
when you first arrived.

14:29.159 --> 14:31.495
I phoned the office of Army records.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.414
I was wrong.

14:33.831 --> 14:36.417
You were in the service,
as your résumé stated.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.043
You were a nurse.

14:39.086 --> 14:44.300
But the records didn't mention
the manner in which you were discharged,

14:44.925 --> 14:48.429
and I wonder if you might want to tell me
what happened.

14:58.898 --> 14:59.732
No.

15:00.941 --> 15:02.026
I wasn't a nurse.

15:03.402 --> 15:06.530
<i>I had no training,</i>
<i>so I lied and said I did.</i>

15:06.614 --> 15:08.616
<i>-I wanted to be a nurse.</i>

15:08.699 --> 15:10.117
<i>I wanted to help people.</i>

15:11.118 --> 15:13.454
<i>And I felt a calling,</i>

15:13.537 --> 15:18.584
<i>a genuine calling that I knew</i>
<i>was deep and abiding and true.</i>

15:18.667 --> 15:19.835
I was an orphan.

15:21.837 --> 15:24.173
Poor, without an education.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.217
So I just did it.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.470
I lied.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.847
Is there anything I can do to help you?

15:32.806 --> 15:33.641
Yes.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.726
All I was guilty of

15:35.809 --> 15:38.812
was showing these men mercy
when no one else would.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.232
But then it got me into trouble.

15:42.316 --> 15:43.192
<i>Nurse Ratched,</i>

15:43.275 --> 15:47.279
quite a number of soldiers under your care
appear to have died of asphyxiation

15:47.363 --> 15:49.531
without any wounds
to their throat or lungs.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.034
Sir, I stand behind
the treatment I've provided

15:52.117 --> 15:54.536
for every serviceman
who's come under my care.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.872
I have a sterling reputation.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.082
Just ask my superiors--

15:58.165 --> 16:00.751
Your superiors are why
I am talking to you.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.336
They recommended a court-martial.

16:02.419 --> 16:06.548
One look in your eye and I can see
plain as day you're as guilty as hell.

16:06.632 --> 16:10.135
But they won't be able to prove it.
So, there ain't gonna be a court-martial.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.304
Get the fuck off this island
and out of my Army.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.222
Move!

16:27.486 --> 16:28.946
<i>Well, I couldn't stand it.</i>

16:29.780 --> 16:31.740
<i>I served, just as they had.</i>

16:33.784 --> 16:36.328
<i>I deem this reply a full acceptance</i>

16:36.412 --> 16:38.330
<i>of the Potsdam Declaration,</i>

16:38.414 --> 16:42.001
<i>which specifies</i>
<i>the unconditional surrender of Japan.</i>

16:42.084 --> 16:44.503
<i>In the reply, there is no...</i>

16:46.130 --> 16:48.298
The war's over! It's over!

16:48.382 --> 16:51.844
<i>...to an anxious world, setting off</i>
<i>celebrations throughout the country.</i>

16:51.927 --> 16:54.805
<i>-Washington is jubilant, and in the...</i>

17:05.733 --> 17:07.526
<i>So I decided I would lie again.</i>

17:09.445 --> 17:10.612
And it worked.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.074
Dr. Hanover never called the State Board.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.368
He just hired me.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.873
Thank you for your honesty.

17:25.085 --> 17:27.838
I've heard the screams

17:27.921 --> 17:30.007
of very ill people wanting to die.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.343
I've had patients beg me to kill them.

17:35.387 --> 17:36.597
But I never would.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.683
That's the difference between us.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.561
I'm strong, and you're weak.

17:44.897 --> 17:45.773
Yes.

17:47.483 --> 17:48.609
You're probably right.

17:49.276 --> 17:50.194
Mm.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.158
You've done... terrible things, Mildred.

17:57.951 --> 17:58.911
That said, I mean...

17:59.953 --> 18:04.291
we've all done stupid things
in the service of stupid men.

18:05.709 --> 18:08.337
Me with Dr. Hanover,
you with your brother.

18:09.338 --> 18:13.675
So, I can't say I don't feel sympathy
for you, Mildred.

18:15.636 --> 18:18.305
I... I really truly do.

18:20.641 --> 18:24.603
And don't think for a second
that I have forgotten your kindness to me

18:24.686 --> 18:25.979
the night of the dance.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.024
It was a foreign feeling,

18:29.566 --> 18:30.567
your kindness.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.782
I have a plan for us.

18:36.865 --> 18:38.117
For you, for me.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.326
And for the hospital.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.871
But I'm gonna need you to vouch for me.

18:56.343 --> 18:59.263
<i>The hospital is as dear to me</i>
<i>as it was to our mother.</i>

18:59.346 --> 19:01.390
While I realize we don't provide
all its funding,

19:01.473 --> 19:04.351
I do believe we are responsible
for the greater part of it, and...

19:05.060 --> 19:06.603
I would hope that could continue.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.565
As girls,
my sister and I wanted to live there.

19:10.023 --> 19:15.737
My sister, Francine, she began
to display some disturbing traits

19:15.821 --> 19:18.115
when she came upon
the cusp of womanhood.

19:20.784 --> 19:22.161
Calm down, Francine, please!

19:22.786 --> 19:24.413
<i>She began to hear voices.</i>

19:24.496 --> 19:25.706
-Darling!

19:25.789 --> 19:27.624
<i>At first, they were angels, but...</i>

19:29.042 --> 19:31.253
...soon they were the voices of--
of demons.

19:34.798 --> 19:36.466
They put her in a cage.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.478
They said it would eventually cure her,
and it didn't.

19:51.523 --> 19:54.818
Francine was kept in that room
every day for the rest of her life.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.029
-I'm sorry!
-No!

19:57.112 --> 19:58.739
<i>A life that was short, mercifully.</i>

19:58.822 --> 20:03.035
One day, she broke free
and jumped out the window,

20:03.452 --> 20:04.912
breaking her neck.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.371
She was finally free.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.169
My apologies.

20:12.252 --> 20:16.173
You certainly didn't come here
to hear... my life story.

20:17.424 --> 20:19.593
What is it that brings you ladies here?

20:20.844 --> 20:22.012
Well, it's, um...

20:22.763 --> 20:25.265
Uh-- I suppose it's rather sensitive.

20:25.807 --> 20:27.017
It's about Dr. Hanover.

20:27.559 --> 20:28.518
Y-- Yes?

20:28.602 --> 20:31.021
He's fallen out of favor
with the governor,

20:31.104 --> 20:34.191
who is now poised
to pull all state funding,

20:34.274 --> 20:38.320
which accounts for a large portion
of our operations.

20:38.403 --> 20:42.157
So your foundation would need
to provide <i>all</i> the funding

20:42.241 --> 20:43.825
in order to keep the hospital running.

20:43.909 --> 20:47.204
We have a whole list of grievances.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.874
You see, Dr. Hanover, he...

20:51.708 --> 20:53.085
he's a dope fiend.

20:54.419 --> 20:55.545
He's a drug abuser.

20:55.879 --> 20:57.631
A drug abuser. That's-- That's it.

20:57.714 --> 20:58.548
Is that all?

20:58.882 --> 21:02.469
Uh... Well, no. But shouldn't it be?

21:03.971 --> 21:04.805
If I may?

21:06.515 --> 21:08.600
Nurse Bucket is being
entirely too cautious.

21:08.684 --> 21:12.854
We have reason to suspect that
Dr. Hanover's credentials are forgeries.

21:13.397 --> 21:14.356
That in fact,

21:14.439 --> 21:17.025
his real name is Dr. Manuel Bañaga,

21:17.109 --> 21:19.027
and he is guilty of serious crimes

21:19.111 --> 21:22.239
that will pose a grave criminal liability
for your foundation.

21:22.322 --> 21:24.116
But that's not on the list.

21:24.199 --> 21:25.742
This is what you suspect?

21:25.826 --> 21:26.994
I know it for a fact.

21:28.912 --> 21:32.124
As of this moment, however,
the general public does not.

21:32.207 --> 21:35.961
Dr. Bañaga was hired by a wealthy heiress
named Lenore Osgood

21:36.753 --> 21:40.465
to treat her mentally ill son,
and during the course of these treatments,

21:40.549 --> 21:43.760
Dr. Bañaga cut off the boy's arms and

21:43.844 --> 21:45.595
sewed on the severed limbs

21:45.679 --> 21:49.141
of one of Mrs. Osgood's employees
who had just been murdered.

21:49.224 --> 21:51.518
The procedure caused
the boy's system to be septic.

21:51.601 --> 21:52.894
He lost both arms, of course,

21:52.978 --> 21:54.521
-but also his legs...

21:54.604 --> 21:56.815
...which had to be amputated
in order to keep him alive.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.401
That should be on the list.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.528
He should be removed immediately.

22:03.363 --> 22:07.743
Though it does beg the question,
who will run the hospital?

22:08.368 --> 22:10.704
That is, until we can find a replacement.

22:10.787 --> 22:15.834
In my professional opinion, there is
no better candidate for interim head

22:15.917 --> 22:18.295
-than Nurse Betsy Bucket here.
-Oh.

22:18.378 --> 22:22.215
And believe me when I tell you,
she practically runs the place as it is.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.103
Well...

22:36.021 --> 22:37.147
I guess I owe you one.

22:38.774 --> 22:39.733
Do you mean that?

22:41.234 --> 22:42.319
Yes. Why?

22:44.613 --> 22:46.114
Then make Huck head nurse.

22:47.574 --> 22:48.575
What?

22:48.658 --> 22:50.577
He isn't even remotely qualified.

22:50.660 --> 22:52.788
Neither am I, remember?

22:54.539 --> 22:56.375
He's hard-working, he's trustworthy.

22:57.751 --> 23:01.463
He'll devote his life to the hospital
if you just give him the opportunity.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.133
Oh, Betsy.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.676
Come on, it's the right thing to do.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.804
-What are you up to?
-I'm not up to anything.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.602
Nurse Bucket, I'd like to be alone,
if you wouldn't mind.

23:27.447 --> 23:28.281
What's this?

23:29.199 --> 23:30.242
Dr. Hanover...

23:31.118 --> 23:32.786
you've been dismissed.

23:32.869 --> 23:33.787
I have been named

23:33.870 --> 23:37.040
interim head of this hospital
until a replacement can be found.

23:37.124 --> 23:38.834
You are free to collect your belongings,

23:38.917 --> 23:41.294
but you are asked
to please vacate the premises.

23:42.045 --> 23:43.046
The police, uh...

23:44.089 --> 23:46.591
have been made aware of your identity.

23:46.675 --> 23:47.926
-Wait.
-And--

23:48.009 --> 23:49.928
My identity, yes. I...

23:51.179 --> 23:53.306
...have been struggling
with substance abuse, but--

23:53.390 --> 23:54.224
Doctor.

23:55.183 --> 23:57.727
I know <i>why</i> you changed your name.

24:01.314 --> 24:04.484
I know what you did to that young man
that you were treating.

24:04.568 --> 24:08.655
Now, I don't believe
you could be at fault, I truly don't.

24:08.738 --> 24:11.032
But now the police know about it as well,

24:11.116 --> 24:14.619
so you're going to have to explain to them
what really happened.

24:15.996 --> 24:17.080
They're on their way.

24:22.544 --> 24:23.420
Doctor.

24:24.337 --> 24:25.380
I did love you.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.924
I loved your purpose and your calling.

24:28.008 --> 24:29.509
I loved your need to help people.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.887
Just to be able to be near you,
to watch you,

24:31.970 --> 24:33.388
it made me feel so honored.

24:34.931 --> 24:36.099
I believe in you.

24:36.183 --> 24:37.601
I will always believe in you.

24:37.684 --> 24:39.352
Then why would you do this to me?

24:39.936 --> 24:41.229
Look at Charlotte, at...

24:41.646 --> 24:44.566
I'm on the precipice
of helping so many people!

24:45.567 --> 24:47.068
That's why I'm letting you go.

24:58.121 --> 24:59.748
I've treated you poorly, Betsy.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.376
You didn't deserve that.

25:33.406 --> 25:35.909
Dr. Hanover, I'm told you're not supposed
to be handling patients.

25:35.992 --> 25:37.494
No. We are leaving.

25:37.577 --> 25:38.745
You're not in charge anymore.

25:38.828 --> 25:41.706
This patient admitted herself
to this hospital,

25:42.332 --> 25:45.126
and she's free to leave
whenever <i>she </i>chooses.

25:51.967 --> 25:54.761
Do you believe Dr. Hanover's treatments
have helped you?

25:55.887 --> 25:58.348
I believe he's the only person
who can help me.

25:59.933 --> 26:02.269
As head nurse,
I'm allowing both of them to go.

26:05.438 --> 26:08.149
I should have never
let you into this hospital.

26:12.028 --> 26:14.656
I know the kind of price
that's on your head, Doctor.

26:15.991 --> 26:18.159
And I'm letting you
walk right out the door.

26:19.411 --> 26:24.207
So I'd say, letting me into this hospital
was the best decision you ever made.

26:39.931 --> 26:40.765
Thanks.

26:40.849 --> 26:41.725
Hello?

26:42.183 --> 26:43.727
- <i>Mrs. Osgood?</i>
-Yes.

26:43.810 --> 26:44.894
Mildred Ratched.

26:46.187 --> 26:48.023
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

26:49.274 --> 26:51.318
Dr. Hanover is now out of my reach.

26:51.401 --> 26:53.778
I'm sorry, but I simply
won't be able to help you.

26:54.863 --> 26:57.657
I told you I wanted his head on a platter.

26:57.741 --> 27:00.035
Yes. I appreciate that you're angry.

27:00.118 --> 27:01.536
<i>I just need you to understand</i>

27:01.620 --> 27:04.456
<i>that any arrangement we once had</i>
<i>is now null and void.</i>

27:04.539 --> 27:07.584
<i>And if you ever attempt to harm me</i>
<i>or even contact me again,</i>

27:07.667 --> 27:11.254
<i>I will notify the FBI about your attempts</i>
<i>on Dr. Hanover's life.</i>

27:11.338 --> 27:13.590
Do you understand me, Mrs. Osgood?

27:13.673 --> 27:17.010
How dare you betray me,
you double-crossing little--

27:34.903 --> 27:35.779
Hello.

27:36.279 --> 27:37.906
We would like two rooms, please.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.159
That'll be nine dollars.

27:43.119 --> 27:43.953
Name?

27:46.539 --> 27:48.792
Davis. Randall Davis.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.336
Rooms nine and ten.

27:51.961 --> 27:52.796
Thank you.

27:54.422 --> 27:56.132
I feel a bit woozy.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.301
My head is spinning a little.

27:58.385 --> 28:00.095
-You're okay.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.847
The mild sedation I gave you
is starting to wear off.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.849
I just want you to get something
in your stomach,

28:04.933 --> 28:06.226
and then get you off to bed.

28:07.977 --> 28:09.396
And what can I do for you?

28:09.854 --> 28:13.525
Coffee for me, and water...
a soft-boiled egg, perhaps.

28:13.608 --> 28:14.442
With toast.

28:14.693 --> 28:15.527
Yeah.

28:15.819 --> 28:16.736
Thank you.

28:16.820 --> 28:19.197
You know, folks like you,
you gotta pay in advance.

28:27.247 --> 28:28.998
You don't gotta be uppity about it.

28:32.502 --> 28:33.336
Doctor.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.422
If you don't mind my asking...

28:36.965 --> 28:37.966
what is your plan?

28:39.509 --> 28:41.177
My plan is to make you whole.

28:41.261 --> 28:44.806
I'd like to try and get us
across the border to-- to Canada.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.392
Once we get to the crossing...

28:49.144 --> 28:52.230
you will drive,
and I will hide in the trunk.

28:52.313 --> 28:56.443
I have a-- a colleague
at a hospital in Vancouver.

28:56.526 --> 28:58.027
He might be willing to admit you,

28:58.111 --> 29:01.740
and then I can continue our treatments
in secret.

29:01.823 --> 29:06.661
Once you're cured, and I do believe
you will be cured, Charlotte,

29:06.745 --> 29:08.371
then perhaps I can...

29:10.582 --> 29:11.833
I can come out of hiding.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.135
Whoa.

29:23.303 --> 29:25.180
What's happening? Where am I?

29:25.263 --> 29:27.432
Charlotte. It's me. Dr. Hanover.

29:27.515 --> 29:29.434
-Oh.
--I'm just going to get you to bed, okay?

29:30.477 --> 29:31.311
Sit.

29:31.811 --> 29:32.645
Okay.

29:33.563 --> 29:34.397
You're okay.

29:36.983 --> 29:38.818
-Okay, lay down. Go lay down.
-Mm.

29:39.944 --> 29:41.070
This was my fault.

29:41.154 --> 29:44.783
I should have let you--
let you rest as soon as we got here.

29:44.866 --> 29:45.867
But...

29:46.701 --> 29:47.869
you're okay now.

29:48.703 --> 29:49.704
You're okay.

29:51.039 --> 29:51.873
Just sleep.

29:54.501 --> 29:55.543
I'll be right next door.

29:58.087 --> 29:59.464
Police! Anybody in there?

30:01.549 --> 30:03.259
Just a minute.  Fuck.

30:04.052 --> 30:06.805
Charlotte. Get up, get up.
It's the police.

30:11.309 --> 30:12.560
-Get in the closet.
-No, no, no--

30:12.644 --> 30:15.063
-It's okay, it's okay, it's okay--

30:15.146 --> 30:16.564
-It's okay, it's okay.
- No.

30:17.315 --> 30:18.608
No, no, no, please.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.861
-No, no, please.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.700
So sorry, officer, can I help you?

30:27.784 --> 30:30.537
Yeah, you're not the one
who double-parked out front, are you?

30:30.620 --> 30:32.163
-The Cadillac DeVille?

30:32.247 --> 30:35.583
No, I-- unfortunately,
I can't-- I can't afford a Cadillac.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.419
All right. Well,
sorry to bother you. Good night, now.

30:42.882 --> 30:45.468
I'm so sorry, Charlotte.
It was a false alarm.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.137
You're shit.

30:49.722 --> 30:51.140
You're no doctor.

30:51.766 --> 30:54.060
You're garbage.

30:54.143 --> 30:55.019
Ondine?

30:55.728 --> 30:57.397
It's me, Dr. Hanover.

30:58.064 --> 31:00.441
Would you please tell Charlotte
she's safe?

31:00.525 --> 31:03.695
How dare you shut me in a closet.

31:04.279 --> 31:09.534
I played first chair violin
for the Boston Pops.

31:09.617 --> 31:12.620
And who... are you?

31:14.163 --> 31:16.583
You're nothing!

31:17.292 --> 31:19.335
You're noooo--!

31:22.922 --> 31:24.382
Ooh.

31:29.596 --> 31:30.555
Charlotte?

31:30.972 --> 31:32.140
Hitler!

31:33.349 --> 31:35.602
You're Adolf Hitler!

31:37.020 --> 31:40.523
I knew you'd try and find me someday,

31:40.607 --> 31:44.611
but I found you instead,
you Nazi son of a bitch!

31:44.694 --> 31:46.654
Charlotte, it's me, your doctor.
Dr. Hanover--

31:46.738 --> 31:49.240
-You changed your little mustache.

31:49.949 --> 31:53.953
Well, you ain't fooling nobody...

31:55.663 --> 31:56.664
...Adolf!

31:56.748 --> 31:58.708
You remember me? Huh?!

31:59.500 --> 32:00.877
Apollo?

32:01.502 --> 32:07.091
I'm the motherfucker that won
all them gold medals at your Olympics.

32:07.175 --> 32:11.262
And that same motherfucker
gets to kill you!

33:26.796 --> 33:27.922
Nurse Ratched?

33:28.006 --> 33:29.841
There's a woman on the phone for you.

33:29.924 --> 33:30.758
Thank you.

33:31.426 --> 33:32.885
This is Nurse Ratched.

33:37.682 --> 33:38.516
Where are you?

33:42.520 --> 33:44.731
Lock the door and stay where you are.

33:44.814 --> 33:45.815
I'm on my way.

34:02.248 --> 34:04.292
I can't remember what happened.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.294
I swear, I can't remember.

34:06.961 --> 34:07.879
Um...

34:08.421 --> 34:11.132
There--
There was someone at the door, so...

34:12.425 --> 34:15.970
he threw me in the closet, and then
I can't remember what happened.

34:17.555 --> 34:20.641
Suddenly, I was--
I was-- I was--

34:20.725 --> 34:22.602
I was sitting on the bathroom floor,

34:22.685 --> 34:26.230
and I was covered in blood.
And I came out and I found him...

34:26.314 --> 34:28.149
I found him just-- just lying there.

34:28.232 --> 34:31.319
-Did I do this? Did I? Did I?
-Charlotte, listen to me.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.570
-I didn't mean it.
-Sit down.

34:32.653 --> 34:35.406
-I didn't mean to, but I must have!
-Please sit down, deep breaths. Sit.

34:35.490 --> 34:36.824
-Oh, my God!
-Listen to me.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.117
Oh, my God!

34:38.201 --> 34:40.828
I know that this wasn't your fault.

34:40.912 --> 34:43.122
You cared very much for Dr. Hanover

34:43.206 --> 34:45.875
and would never willingly
do anything to harm him.

34:45.958 --> 34:48.836
But unfortunately, the police
are not going to understand that.

34:50.004 --> 34:51.923
And I'm afraid you don't have much time.

34:53.716 --> 34:54.967
Let's get you cleaned up.

34:56.385 --> 34:57.553
I brought your clothes.

35:03.059 --> 35:05.812
<i>Bus 387, San Diego, boarding now.</i>

35:06.479 --> 35:07.522
Thank you very much.

35:07.605 --> 35:10.274
<i>...put large luggage</i>
<i>in the stowaway cabins.</i>

35:10.358 --> 35:12.985
That bus leaves for San Diego
in five minutes.

35:13.569 --> 35:16.155
Cross the border into Mexico, on foot.

35:16.739 --> 35:17.949
Make your way to Ensenada.

35:18.032 --> 35:21.285
There's a psychiatric hospital there
called San Luis.

35:23.454 --> 35:25.039
You will be safe there for now.

35:26.415 --> 35:27.708
It's all right.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.212
There's $50 in that suitcase.

35:33.214 --> 35:35.508
If you telephone me in a few weeks,

35:36.008 --> 35:38.094
I might be able to send you a lot more.

35:38.803 --> 35:40.096
Thank you, Mildred.

35:41.806 --> 35:45.017
I don't feel I'm deserving
of such kindness.

35:45.101 --> 35:45.935
What...

35:47.103 --> 35:47.937
What is it?

35:49.647 --> 35:51.232
What about Dr. Hanover?

35:54.026 --> 35:55.194
I'll take care of that.

38:10.579 --> 38:11.414
Hi, there.

38:17.295 --> 38:20.381
Well, I did not expect to see you.

38:53.289 --> 38:54.373
Oh...

39:06.552 --> 39:07.762
And now to payment.

39:30.993 --> 39:32.620
Pleasure doing business with ya.

39:56.769 --> 39:59.522
I've waited so long for this moment.

39:59.605 --> 40:00.439
Mother.

40:28.008 --> 40:29.718
This doesn't fix anything, Mother.

40:30.803 --> 40:31.887
I know that.

40:34.557 --> 40:35.433
But now...

40:36.642 --> 40:41.105
we can finally rest
knowing that that man has paid

40:41.188 --> 40:43.774
for the terrible thing he did to you.

40:46.026 --> 40:47.570
What about what you did to me?

40:49.238 --> 40:51.115
You're the one who hired him.

40:52.867 --> 40:55.828
You're the one who's kept me
cooped up in here, hiding me

40:55.911 --> 40:58.330
-because you're so, so ashamed.
-No...

40:58.873 --> 40:59.748
Yes, Mommy.

41:00.166 --> 41:01.041
-No.
-Yes.

41:03.419 --> 41:05.588
You love your monkey
more than you love me.

41:05.671 --> 41:08.549
- Oh, no.
-Yes, you do, Mommy.

41:08.632 --> 41:10.926
I don't. I love you.

41:11.010 --> 41:12.803
My darling boy.

41:12.887 --> 41:14.305
I love you.

41:14.388 --> 41:15.681
I hate you, Mother.

41:17.850 --> 41:20.478
And now you're going to pay
for all the things you've done to me.

42:02.811 --> 42:06.106
Yes, I'm looking for Mildred Ratched.

42:06.190 --> 42:08.275
Can you tell me which room?

42:08.359 --> 42:09.485
I heard your car pull up.

42:13.030 --> 42:13.864
Hello, Anna.

42:14.448 --> 42:15.991
It's been a long time, Milly.

42:17.868 --> 42:20.162
Who is this, a distant relation?

42:20.246 --> 42:21.747
Up yours, Louise.

42:23.499 --> 42:24.917
If you'll follow me, please.

42:27.670 --> 42:30.923
<i>I still blame myself</i>
<i>for what happened to you and Edmund.</i>

42:31.006 --> 42:33.676
I was the one that found them for you.

42:33.759 --> 42:34.593
No.

42:36.512 --> 42:38.806
You were our guardian angel.

42:40.599 --> 42:43.477
Angels don't make mistakes like that.

42:44.979 --> 42:48.399
That couple, I thought they'd be
the perfect foster parents.

42:51.735 --> 42:54.572
When I found out
what they did to you and Edmund,

42:55.239 --> 42:59.076
I-- I wanted to gouge out
their eyes myself.

43:01.912 --> 43:05.249
"Their murder was ruled
a justifiable homicide"?

43:05.332 --> 43:06.166
I didn't know that.

43:06.250 --> 43:09.670
It was the state that put you
into that house, after all.

43:10.421 --> 43:14.341
Afterwards, Edmund was sent
to a home for delinquent boys.

43:14.425 --> 43:15.551
-I went there.
-What?

43:17.011 --> 43:17.845
When?

43:18.721 --> 43:19.888
It's where I saw him.

43:20.514 --> 43:22.516
When? When did you see him?

43:24.351 --> 43:26.270
When I got out of the foster system,

43:26.353 --> 43:29.398
I contacted every juvenile facility
in the state,

43:29.481 --> 43:32.443
and no one would tell me
if they had my Edmund.

43:32.526 --> 43:35.988
<i>-So I started visiting them, one by one.</i>

43:36.071 --> 43:38.616
<i>And it took two years,</i>
<i>but I finally found him.</i>

43:43.162 --> 43:43.996
Edmund!

43:59.637 --> 44:00.471
Hi.

44:00.929 --> 44:01.805
Mildred.

44:03.349 --> 44:05.017
I've been looking everywhere for you.

44:05.809 --> 44:06.685
Well, you found me.

44:10.064 --> 44:11.190
And just in time, too.

44:11.815 --> 44:13.192
I'm getting out of here in a week.

44:13.692 --> 44:14.652
Really?

44:16.528 --> 44:17.571
Yeah, next Wednesday.

44:18.656 --> 44:19.490
8:00 a.m.

44:19.573 --> 44:20.532
Oh, Edmund.

44:21.325 --> 44:22.576
I will be here.

44:23.410 --> 44:24.745
I'll take you with me.

44:25.454 --> 44:27.414
We will stay together.

44:27.998 --> 44:28.832
I promise.

44:30.709 --> 44:31.835
Yeah, I'd like that.

44:33.045 --> 44:34.088
Play time's over!

44:35.589 --> 44:37.508
Next Wednesday, 8:00 a.m.

44:39.176 --> 44:40.552
-Don't forget.

44:42.513 --> 44:44.264
When I went back the next week...

44:46.392 --> 44:47.601
he was already gone.

44:51.438 --> 44:52.564
He lied to me.

44:56.777 --> 44:58.862
He had been released the day before.

45:00.030 --> 45:01.490
On a Tuesday.

45:02.908 --> 45:04.368
He told me Wednesday.

45:07.996 --> 45:09.957
But I'd left him behind
all those years ago,

45:10.040 --> 45:11.375
so it was payback, I guess.

45:11.458 --> 45:12.334
Oh, Mildred.

45:13.377 --> 45:15.421
No, there was nothing
you could have done for him.

45:15.504 --> 45:17.673
He was already too broken by then.

45:18.298 --> 45:21.677
His mother was a woman
by the name of Margaret McGuire.

45:21.760 --> 45:24.012
Before she died of a drug overdose,

45:24.096 --> 45:25.639
she had been a nun.

45:26.140 --> 45:29.560
And claimed to have been raped
by a man named Joseph Sullivan...

45:31.103 --> 45:33.856
one of the four priests
that Edmund murdered.

45:33.939 --> 45:34.940
Oh, God.

45:36.567 --> 45:37.526
Oh, God.

45:39.945 --> 45:41.071
Mildred.

45:41.155 --> 45:43.824
I know that you want to help him,

45:44.658 --> 45:49.455
but don't waste your life trying to save
someone who cannot be saved.

45:56.211 --> 45:58.046
I feel like
you might be overreacting.

45:58.130 --> 46:00.466
You just lost your job, that's all.

46:00.549 --> 46:02.134
So moving East?

46:02.217 --> 46:04.887
Don't choose a long-term solution
to a short-term problem.

46:04.970 --> 46:07.681
Governor Wilburn is not a nice man.

46:07.765 --> 46:10.726
He's not the dirtiest there is,
but he's not the cleanest, either.

46:10.809 --> 46:14.313
The second I get close to a job
with another elected,

46:14.396 --> 46:16.607
he'll threaten them,
or make up lies about me.

46:16.690 --> 46:20.110
My only chance for a job in politics is...

46:20.903 --> 46:23.614
to go back East, far away from him.

46:28.827 --> 46:30.954
Oh, my darling.

46:31.038 --> 46:32.206
Ex-darling.

46:33.832 --> 46:34.750
Gwendolyn...

46:35.959 --> 46:38.003
I will miss you.

46:42.341 --> 46:44.968
I'm sorry about the things that I said
when it ended.

46:45.052 --> 46:46.428
That was...

46:46.887 --> 46:49.723
that was not my finest hour.

46:49.807 --> 46:51.600
-I was hurt--
-Trevor, Trevor--

46:51.683 --> 46:53.268
No, let me say this.

46:53.644 --> 46:57.523
I was hurt...
because I did love you so much.

46:58.190 --> 46:59.066
I do.

46:59.733 --> 47:02.569
But as per absolutely always,
you were right.

47:03.779 --> 47:06.406
There is a better life out there
for the both of us.

47:08.200 --> 47:09.034
I met...

47:12.329 --> 47:14.665
I met a wonderful man, Gwen.

47:15.833 --> 47:17.042
His name is Andrew,

47:17.543 --> 47:18.794
and he is just...

47:19.837 --> 47:22.464
everything I thought I couldn't have,

47:22.548 --> 47:24.049
so I owe you for him.

47:24.132 --> 47:25.300
Oh, I'm so glad.

47:26.051 --> 47:27.052
I'm so glad.

47:34.184 --> 47:38.730
Wherever you end up, whatever you need,
I will always be there for you.

47:39.439 --> 47:40.941
And I will always love you.

48:20.188 --> 48:21.648
I was hoping we could talk.

48:28.071 --> 48:29.656
<i>You checked out of the motel.</i>

48:31.199 --> 48:32.534
<i>I tried to telephone you.</i>

48:33.744 --> 48:35.871
The governor's fired me, Mildred.

48:36.496 --> 48:37.998
My career is over.

48:38.081 --> 48:40.208
I'm going home to Connecticut
to live with my mother.

48:40.292 --> 48:42.044
Maybe I can get a job
at the five-and-dime.

48:42.127 --> 48:43.545
May I offer you some tea?

48:46.381 --> 48:48.008
I would love some. Thank you.

48:49.051 --> 48:50.802
You lied to me from the very beginning.

48:50.886 --> 48:54.097
You used me as a way
to keep your brother alive.

48:54.181 --> 48:55.265
I didn't lie to you.

48:55.724 --> 48:58.143
I just-- I couldn't tell you everything
right away--

48:58.226 --> 49:00.562
Mildred! You lied!

49:01.146 --> 49:03.357
Until the lie didn't serve you anymore.

49:03.732 --> 49:05.359
Then you decided to tell the truth.

49:05.442 --> 49:08.612
And I understand that
the world has not been kind to you,

49:08.695 --> 49:10.405
and I'm sorry for that, I truly am,

49:10.489 --> 49:14.368
but that doesn't give you the right
to dissemble at every possible opportunity

49:14.451 --> 49:16.954
to the people around you
whose only mistake was to care about you.

49:17.037 --> 49:18.121
I know that.

49:18.580 --> 49:19.498
Do you?

49:19.581 --> 49:21.249
Because I honestly don't think
that you do.

49:21.333 --> 49:23.001
My feelings for you are real.

49:23.085 --> 49:23.961
I don't think...

49:25.128 --> 49:27.172
that you have any idea
what your feelings are,

49:27.839 --> 49:30.968
because you have been lying for so long.

49:31.802 --> 49:33.428
It's second nature to you.

49:33.553 --> 49:34.888
You even lie to yourself.

49:35.472 --> 49:36.390
Well, your lying

49:36.473 --> 49:41.061
and your selfishness
have cost me... everything.

49:41.645 --> 49:43.313
I don't know what my life is anymore.

49:43.397 --> 49:47.526
I don't understand how I got so...
tangled up in you,

49:47.609 --> 49:50.946
and I don't understand
whether my feelings for you are real.

49:51.029 --> 49:53.782
And you waltzed into my heart,
and I cannot get you out.

49:53.865 --> 49:54.908
Gwendolyn.

49:55.575 --> 49:56.410
I love you.

49:57.452 --> 49:58.286
Gwendolyn.

50:03.458 --> 50:06.461
I don't even know
what I'm supposed to say to that.

50:07.671 --> 50:10.924
And anyway, I don't believe you!

50:15.971 --> 50:17.222
What I kept from you...

50:18.473 --> 50:20.934
that was not easy for me to do.

50:22.019 --> 50:24.146
I wanted to tell you everything.

50:24.229 --> 50:27.232
And I understand how awful
that would make you feel,

50:27.315 --> 50:29.693
how used you must have felt.

50:31.695 --> 50:36.241
The lies I told to get into that hospital,
to get closer to Edmund...

50:36.992 --> 50:39.911
Those were amoral acts,
and I understand that completely,

50:39.995 --> 50:43.290
but you must understand
that I had no choice.

50:44.416 --> 50:47.586
And if I had to,
I would do it all over again.

50:49.880 --> 50:53.717
I wish you could leave
the pain I've caused behind us.

50:54.634 --> 50:57.763
Let go of the resentment, the suspicion.

50:57.846 --> 51:01.391
My feelings for you
are the truest thing in me.

51:02.142 --> 51:04.144
I love you. Do you hear me?

51:04.227 --> 51:05.520
I love you.

51:08.774 --> 51:10.400
Dr. Hanover is dead.

51:10.484 --> 51:11.318
He's...

51:12.319 --> 51:13.320
No, no, no.

51:14.029 --> 51:14.946
Please...

51:15.238 --> 51:16.907
tell me... tell me you didn't--

51:16.990 --> 51:18.784
No, no.

51:19.785 --> 51:21.119
No, I had nothing to do with it,

51:21.203 --> 51:24.623
but as a result,
I have come into some money.

51:24.706 --> 51:27.626
I-- I don't want to hear what I'm sure
are all the sordid particulars.

51:27.709 --> 51:30.170
Gwendolyn, it means we can--
we can run away together, you and--

51:30.253 --> 51:32.589
And my answer to you, Mildred, is no.

51:33.673 --> 51:35.425
That is not what my life is going to be.

51:35.509 --> 51:36.343
<i>Our</i> life.

51:36.426 --> 51:37.636
-It is not!
-Why?

51:37.719 --> 51:40.347
All right. Do you hear me?
That is not what my life is going to be.

51:40.430 --> 51:41.807
-Why not? Why?
-It just isn't.

51:41.890 --> 51:44.184
Because I had an x-ray yesterday.

51:46.103 --> 51:50.023
Because the doctor wanted to see
how my lung was healing.

51:51.483 --> 51:54.861
And he found a tumor the size of a walnut
inside my left breast.

51:56.196 --> 51:57.030
What?

51:57.114 --> 51:58.532
And I don't have long.

51:59.116 --> 52:00.534
-We will find someone.
-We?

52:01.993 --> 52:03.036
We'll find a doctor.

52:03.120 --> 52:04.830
-Yes, we. You have to.
-No. You have to stop.

52:04.913 --> 52:07.165
-Listen to me, God damn it--
-You have to stop!

52:07.249 --> 52:09.334
There is nothing that anyone can do!

52:10.210 --> 52:11.044
Okay.

52:13.547 --> 52:14.381
Okay.

52:16.675 --> 52:18.093
I'm going to find someone.

52:19.761 --> 52:20.595
A doctor.

52:22.097 --> 52:23.890
We have all the money in the world.

52:25.934 --> 52:28.228
We will go to the ends of the Earth
if we have to.

52:28.687 --> 52:31.398
I love you, do you hear me?
I will not lose you.

52:34.276 --> 52:35.735
Oh, Mildred...

52:36.194 --> 52:37.070
I love you.

52:37.154 --> 52:38.029
I love you.

52:59.926 --> 53:00.760
Next page.

53:04.014 --> 53:05.348
There it is, there it is.

53:08.268 --> 53:09.811
Fucking Diego.

53:11.771 --> 53:13.064
Mm, the nerve.

53:13.899 --> 53:16.109
Told the police that
I had him kill my mother.

53:16.193 --> 53:17.694
Can you imagine?

53:18.904 --> 53:20.780
Of course, they didn't believe him.

53:21.323 --> 53:22.991
Stupid fool.

53:25.327 --> 53:26.328
I miss my mother.

53:27.245 --> 53:29.331
Master Henry, your lawyer is here.

53:29.414 --> 53:33.293
This is the last will and testament
of Lenore Hortense Osgood.

53:34.419 --> 53:38.965
"I will, devise, bequeath and give half
of all my property and estate

53:39.049 --> 53:40.300
of every kind and character,

53:40.383 --> 53:43.929
including but not limited
to real and personal property,

53:44.012 --> 53:46.890
in which I may have an interest
at the date of my death,

53:46.973 --> 53:47.807
to...

53:48.683 --> 53:50.685
the West Indies Art Foundation

53:50.769 --> 53:54.105
for the construction of a museum
in Bridgetown, Barbados,

53:54.189 --> 53:58.068
of which the paintings and sculptures
I have purchased over the years

53:58.151 --> 54:00.362
will constitute a permanent collection.

54:00.445 --> 54:01.404
The other half...

54:02.906 --> 54:07.494
will go to my monkey, Petunia,
and her continued care."

54:07.577 --> 54:08.870
What?!

54:08.954 --> 54:09.996
-Wha--?!

54:10.080 --> 54:14.167
"My son, Henry, will be transferred
to the care of a psychiatric institution,

54:14.251 --> 54:16.920
where he will spend the rest of his life.

54:17.003 --> 54:22.759
I hereby revoke any and all prior wills
and codicils I have made. Signed,

54:23.260 --> 54:24.928
L.H. Osgood."

54:27.555 --> 54:31.101
I realize this news comes
as a shock to most of you.

54:31.184 --> 54:34.437
But I assure you, this transition
in leadership

54:34.521 --> 54:37.857
has been and will remain seamless,

54:37.941 --> 54:39.943
with fewer bizarre...

54:40.026 --> 54:42.070
...and seemingly...

54:42.153 --> 54:44.447
...avoidable incidents.

54:44.531 --> 54:48.451
I have been named
interim head of Lucia State Hospital

54:48.535 --> 54:51.246
until Dr. Hanover's replacement
can be found.

54:51.329 --> 54:55.333
The selection and interview process
for qualified candidates...

54:56.042 --> 54:58.461
It could take a while.

54:58.837 --> 55:01.131
But Nurse Ratched has agreed to stay on.

55:01.881 --> 55:07.804
And I am promoting Huck Finnegan
to the position of head nurse,

55:07.887 --> 55:12.350
so that we will be able to continue
caring for our existing patients,

55:12.434 --> 55:16.396
as well as seeking out new ones.

55:16.479 --> 55:21.443
And it is my mission that
every bed in this facility will be filled

55:21.526 --> 55:22.902
as soon as is practical.

55:23.862 --> 55:25.280
But make no mistake,

55:25.905 --> 55:29.326
it is a new day at this hospital,

55:29.409 --> 55:35.540
and I am overjoyed and humbled
to have been given the opportunity

55:35.623 --> 55:41.171
to provide you all with an example
of leadership, grace,

55:41.921 --> 55:46.384
and world-class caregiving
for the neediest among us.

55:49.095 --> 55:51.639
Now, let's get to work.

55:52.307 --> 55:53.308
Excuse me?

55:54.893 --> 55:57.312
Um, what about doctors?

55:58.063 --> 55:59.272
Do we even have any?

56:01.149 --> 56:02.025
Honestly...

56:03.485 --> 56:04.402
who needs them?
