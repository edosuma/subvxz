00:00.001 --> 00:03.435
<i> Previously on</i> scorpion...
I want to know
who this fella is.

00:03.437 --> 00:04.336
Who the hell are you?

00:04.338 --> 00:05.371
I'm Sylvester.

00:05.373 --> 00:06.472
What kind of man are you?

00:06.474 --> 00:07.573
The kind of man that's been

00:07.575 --> 00:08.574
caring for your daughter.

00:08.576 --> 00:10.242
Cabe, you need
a place to crash

00:10.244 --> 00:11.510
for a couple
weeks, right?

00:11.512 --> 00:13.045
As of now, happy's apartment
has a vacancy.

00:14.015 --> 00:15.547
I am running for
the 16th district

00:15.549 --> 00:18.450
alderman of west altadenia
in the local upcoming election.

00:18.452 --> 00:21.553
Mr. o'brien,
welcome to America.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.122
Happy and i
can get married.

00:23.124 --> 00:25.057
I'm not pregnant.

00:29.663 --> 00:32.297
Sylvester:
Caitlin, Megan, Molly,

00:32.299 --> 00:33.332
cousin Ian,

00:33.334 --> 00:34.600
uncle Tobin, uncle Sean,

00:34.602 --> 00:36.368
great grandpa Sean,
Sean the third.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.438
There's a familiar sourpuss.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.507
I have all the
names down.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.342
So, I'll know everyone on sight,

00:43.344 --> 00:45.644
so we can dive into this pattern
day ceremony without any...

00:45.646 --> 00:46.612
Pesky social awkwardness?

00:46.614 --> 00:47.679
You are brimming

00:47.681 --> 00:49.415
with anxiety.
I'm trying to make

00:49.417 --> 00:50.716
a good impression.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.584
These people are my relations.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.553
By marriage.
They're mine by blood.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.821
And-and trust me,
you're expending

00:55.823 --> 00:57.623
great effort and energy
on people

00:57.625 --> 00:58.724
who may not return the favor.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.592
Blessing Megan's cenotaph

01:00.594 --> 01:02.127
is-is special.

01:02.128 --> 01:03.661
This pattern day
i-is important to me.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.130
Cabe:
Not clear why they call it

01:05.132 --> 01:07.066
pattern day.

01:07.068 --> 01:08.801
Patterned after what?

01:08.802 --> 01:10.535
Pattern is a corruption
of the word "patron,"

01:10.538 --> 01:11.637
as in "patron Saint."

01:11.639 --> 01:13.606
You could Google it.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.574
I like to practice
my human interaction.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.176
(Whispers):
It's a valuable skill.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.577
Walter:
Blessing a rock

01:18.579 --> 01:21.313
with Megan's name on it--
it's-it's not special.

01:21.315 --> 01:22.781
She's not even there.
She's in space.

01:22.783 --> 01:23.816
A cenotaph

01:23.818 --> 01:26.151
is a lovely remembrance.

01:26.153 --> 01:27.152
It's an honor

01:27.154 --> 01:28.220
to be invited.

01:28.222 --> 01:29.421
I couldn't agree more.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.589
And since sly's
obviously nervous,

01:30.591 --> 01:32.124
why don't you help him
out a little.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.592
Give him a rundown
of what to expect.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.327
Okay.

01:36.497 --> 01:39.431
So, you can expect my father
to be my father;

01:39.433 --> 01:41.500
my mother, the same;
And then

01:41.502 --> 01:43.068
my uncle Tobin,
my mother's brother,

01:43.069 --> 01:44.635
he will snort at you
and grumble about the war.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.205
Which war is
anyone's guess.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.506
And then
Thomas and Conner,

01:47.508 --> 01:49.341
my childhood neighbors,
are unlikely

01:49.343 --> 01:51.143
to have changed
from their formative years,

01:51.145 --> 01:52.277
which were
spent perfecting

01:52.279 --> 01:54.713
the wedgie and the... sweaty.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.615
Never heard
of a "sweaty."

01:56.617 --> 01:58.817
Yeah, you don't want to be
on the receiving end of one.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.252
Walter:
I will wager that

02:00.254 --> 02:02.121
Tim is the one who's
most likely to be embraced.

02:02.123 --> 02:03.222
Why me?

02:03.224 --> 02:05.157
Because to some,
the ability to lug

02:05.159 --> 02:07.860
multiple grain sacks from
a storm cellar is impressive.

02:07.862 --> 02:10.696
Knowing pi
to the 34th place is not.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.631
You have seen your parents
since Megan died,

02:12.633 --> 02:14.566
and they watched you do
amazing things that day.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.268
Maybe they passed it along
to the family.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.269
Doubtful.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.437
N-now, I'm busy.

02:18.439 --> 02:19.671
Excuse me.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.540
I am developing

02:21.542 --> 02:22.541
a revolutionary app.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.843
It maps items
in a grocery store

02:24.845 --> 02:26.411
and it cuts down
annual shopping time

02:26.413 --> 02:27.880
by half, so that averages

02:27.882 --> 02:29.548
to 26 hours
a year per adult.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.166
It's efficiency.

02:31.167 --> 02:32.783
Tim: Yeah, when I want
something at a grocery store,

02:32.786 --> 02:34.620
I usually just ask someone
who works there.

02:34.622 --> 02:37.923
Yeah, but with this,
you won't have to talk...

02:37.925 --> 02:39.625
To anyone.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.426
Right.

02:43.864 --> 02:47.499
This is what happens
when you don't interact enough.

02:49.904 --> 02:51.603
Is this what you were
referring to

02:51.605 --> 02:53.472
by the psychiatrics
rule of three?

02:53.474 --> 02:54.640
Explain.

02:54.642 --> 02:55.774
Well, when issues arise,

02:55.776 --> 02:57.609
first time it's a concern,

02:57.611 --> 02:59.912
second time it's a problem,
third time it's a pattern.

02:59.914 --> 03:02.181
Walter created

03:02.183 --> 03:04.550
a canoe-shaped hot dog,
a heavy lead hat for children...

03:04.552 --> 03:06.251
My vertebrae
are still throbbing.

03:06.253 --> 03:09.254
...and now software that is
easily outwitted by your average

03:09.256 --> 03:10.255
stock clerk.

03:10.257 --> 03:11.423
So flustered
that Paige chose

03:11.425 --> 03:12.424
a regular guy
that he's trying

03:12.426 --> 03:13.458
to solve regular
guy problems

03:13.460 --> 03:14.760
to prove he's
regular, too,

03:14.762 --> 03:16.695
but he's flailing.
Bad.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.798
He needs to realize
that Tim's not a bad person.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.200
Then maybe he'll relax.

03:21.202 --> 03:22.968
Exactly.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.704
You know,
if Walt actually liked Tim,

03:25.706 --> 03:27.639
saw in him what Paige saw,

03:27.641 --> 03:29.575
he'd realize that
she made the logical choice

03:29.577 --> 03:30.842
and he'd stop trying to win her.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.212
Problem is...

03:33.214 --> 03:35.681
Walter and Tim, they-they
kind of hate each other.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.583
No, no, they don't need
to actually like each other.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.207
They just need to act
like they do,

03:39.208 --> 03:40.830
and the mind'll take care
of the rest.

03:40.831 --> 03:42.453
But how do we get them
to act like friends?

03:42.456 --> 03:43.655
Friends have things in common.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.524
What's the one thing
they both like?

03:46.594 --> 03:48.527
My mom.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.298
Hey, Tim, my mom's worried
without protection

03:53.300 --> 03:55.701
Walter may face further abuse
in Ireland.

03:55.703 --> 03:56.868
Like sweaties.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.004
And you want me to protect him?

03:59.006 --> 04:01.306
It would comfort mom.

04:01.308 --> 04:02.741
Walter's mental health
is Paramount

04:02.743 --> 04:04.710
to a well-functioning
scorpion.

04:04.712 --> 04:05.944
And no one
will bother him

04:05.946 --> 04:07.946
if he's hanging out
with a Navy seal.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.415
(Chuckles softly)

04:12.586 --> 04:13.252
That is true.

04:13.253 --> 04:13.919
So, Tim's homeland
qualification exam

04:13.921 --> 04:16.322
is coming up.

04:16.323 --> 04:18.724
And there is a logic and
problem-solving portion.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.859
If he fails, he could get
bounced from scorpion.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.362
I'm not sure I'd shed a tear.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.596
But Paige would.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.466
I mean, their relationship
will fade over time,

04:27.468 --> 04:30.335
but if it's prematurely
torn in two,

04:30.337 --> 04:32.537
the mind categorizes
it as unrequited.

04:32.539 --> 04:35.307
"What could have been"
can just linger forever,

04:35.309 --> 04:37.042
along with a resentment
against you,

04:37.044 --> 04:39.011
if she believes you could've
prevented the heartbreak.

04:40.014 --> 04:42.047
How do I help him out?

04:42.049 --> 04:45.651
Pal around with him in Ireland.

04:45.653 --> 04:47.953
If you see an opportunity
to coach him in logic,

04:47.955 --> 04:50.489
statistics
or efficiency quotients,

04:50.491 --> 04:51.757
answer him like
you're his friend.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.293
Not for him. For Paige.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.067
Time to boogie if we're gonna
make that flight.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.068
Ralph, get your backpack.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.670
We're gonna drop you on the way.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.774
I don't get why I need a sitter.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.776
So you don't blow up
a city block.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.311
You left without
taking this again.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.981
You two enjoy
your chelation treatment.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.617
Yeah, fun. I'm hooked up
to an I.V. Draining cadmium

05:18.619 --> 05:20.419
from my body.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.487
I wish I'd never tried
to make those solar panels.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.557
All I got to show for it
is a false pregnancy,

05:25.559 --> 05:27.926
heavy metals
in my blood

05:27.928 --> 05:29.461
and a missed trip to Ireland.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.763
It's bacon, ham
and sausage?

05:31.765 --> 05:32.898
That's a lot of pig.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.367
He makes me one every morning.

05:35.369 --> 05:36.635
It's a heart-attack-wich.

05:36.637 --> 05:37.936
I can't wait for his house

05:37.938 --> 05:40.072
to get fixed up
and he can go home.

05:40.074 --> 05:42.741
Just hanging around him,
i feel like I'm getting older.

05:42.743 --> 05:45.477
This morning, I asked
where my dungarees were.

05:45.479 --> 05:48.113
In a week,
you'll call them slacks.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.481
Cut him loose.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.516
He's been alone for 20 years.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.785
He's desperate for company.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.821
Last night, we played cribbage
until midnight.

05:55.823 --> 05:58.523
My baby's got a heart of gold.

06:01.729 --> 06:02.894
(Shouts)

06:02.896 --> 06:05.530
My subclavicular nerve ending.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.567
Just shut up and clean my blood.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.372
(Sheep bleating)

06:18.545 --> 06:19.811
Oh, here they are.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.515
All right,
here we are.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.120
Sean:
Oh, there he is!

06:28.122 --> 06:30.088
(Laughs)

06:30.090 --> 06:31.857
Sylvester, wonderful
to see you.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.159
It's been too long.
Too, too long.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.594
What a pleasure, Sean.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.696
And Louise, you're
as beautiful as ever.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.498
(Chuckles)
Ah, you're the
sweetest boy alive.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.167
He says that to me
every time we video chat.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.904
Walter.
Mother.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.407
Father.

06:48.409 --> 06:51.009
Good to see you.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.580
So, you stay in
touch with them?

06:55.582 --> 06:57.015
Occasionally.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.016
They're family.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.584
Tobin:
Well...

06:59.586 --> 07:01.887
There's a mad bastard
if I've ever seen one.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.488
Oh, here it comes.
"The damned war."

07:03.490 --> 07:04.523
There's no way

07:04.525 --> 07:06.558
you beat this ancient grenadier

07:06.560 --> 07:08.760
at<i> words with friends </i>
unless you cheated.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.662
How else would a man
know how to spell

07:10.664 --> 07:12.764
"opacifying"?

07:12.765 --> 07:14.865
Well, it's easy if you've
memorized the dictionary.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.169
I wished I lived
in west altadenia.

07:17.171 --> 07:18.870
I'd vote for ya, alderman.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.839
(Chuckling)
Thank you.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.774
He's friends with all of them.
(Laughs) He seemed

07:22.776 --> 07:24.910
to, uh, reach out
and make an effort.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.211
Sean:
Good.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.847
Well, honored
to have you all here.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.333
Enjoy yourselves.

07:31.334 --> 07:33.818
We'll be, uh, we'll be starting
the pattern day observance soon.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.987
Sylvester, you might want
to peel away there first

07:35.989 --> 07:37.989
and take a look
at the condensation catcher

07:37.991 --> 07:40.592
we built after
you sent us that article.

07:40.594 --> 07:41.793
What's this?

07:41.795 --> 07:43.595
It's provided the farm
with much needed water.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.597
We're in the middle
of a year-long drought

07:45.599 --> 07:46.998
and now a heat wave.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.800
Absolutely--
which I predicted.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.703
A-and I sent you plans
for a condensation catcher

07:51.705 --> 07:53.071
three years ago.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.640
Did you?

07:55.642 --> 07:57.108
Well.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.544
Come on, Sylvester.
It's just around here.

07:59.546 --> 08:02.113
Around here.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.851
Nothing has changed.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.153
Thomas:
Ah! Wally, old boy.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.723
Listen, we've got a real
head-scratcher here for you.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.892
Paige, this is, uh,
Thomas and Connor.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.560
They were my neighbors.
I'm sorry, fellas,

08:15.562 --> 08:17.729
it's been a long flight.
Just a quick one.

08:17.731 --> 08:20.098
What's eight million
times eight million?

08:20.100 --> 08:21.533
64 trillion.

08:21.535 --> 08:24.836
The walking brain
does it again!

08:24.838 --> 08:26.104
And what about the platonic
number for antonium?

08:26.106 --> 08:28.573
There's no such
thing as antonium.

08:28.575 --> 08:30.809
There's antimony
and actinium,

08:30.811 --> 08:32.811
and they're not platonic
numbers, they're atomic.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.913
"Platonic" means it's friendly.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.681
You calling your old pal
an idiot?

08:36.683 --> 08:38.116
Why don't you just
answer the question.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.017
You're walking
into their trap.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.819
I'll answer your questions

08:40.821 --> 08:43.405
if you answer
mine first.

08:43.406 --> 08:45.990
So, if Thomas can pick up 20
pounds of potatoes an hour,

08:45.993 --> 08:48.026
then how many hours
will it take

08:48.028 --> 08:50.195
before he's passed out
at the Duke pub?

08:50.197 --> 08:53.698
He's the same arrogant jerk
as when he was nine.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.905
Come on.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.875
Walter...

09:07.080 --> 09:10.081
Hey, you know what, I, uh...

09:10.083 --> 09:11.783
I'll go talk to him.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.051
Really?

09:13.053 --> 09:14.119
Yeah.
Oh. Okay.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.154
Yeah, that'd be great.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.802
You're pretty good at that.

09:33.006 --> 09:35.907
Conservation of momentum
dictates that as the stone

09:35.909 --> 09:38.343
enters the water
and pushes it downwards,

09:38.345 --> 09:40.312
the stone is forced upwards.

09:40.314 --> 09:41.813
Huh.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.752
I come here to get away from
problems like Thomas and Connor.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.821
That's why I'm so good at this.

09:52.693 --> 09:55.694
I get what you're
dealing with.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.128
I've got experience
with bullying myself.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.798
Really?

09:59.800 --> 10:01.750
Absolutely.

10:01.751 --> 10:03.701
People have a tendency
to fall into old patterns

10:03.704 --> 10:05.904
when they go home.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.138
Look, I'll tell you what,

10:07.140 --> 10:08.940
the rest of this trip,
I'll get your back.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.076
It might force, uh,
Thomas and Connor

10:11.078 --> 10:14.112
to give you a little
bit of space.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.851
Walter, hey, what...
What are you staring at?

10:19.853 --> 10:21.219
Dead fish.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.189
They old friends of yours
or something?

10:24.191 --> 10:25.890
(Chuckles)

10:25.892 --> 10:27.726
That was a joke.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.194
No, there are a number
of dead fish,

10:29.196 --> 10:31.630
and the water's bubbling
there and there.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.201
Does it seem cooler
by the lake than normal?

10:36.203 --> 10:37.736
Co2's coming off the lake.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.204
Walter.

10:41.241 --> 10:42.774
Hey!

10:42.776 --> 10:45.377
For our new friends,
it's tradition

10:45.379 --> 10:47.679
that the procession
carries the statue

10:47.681 --> 10:51.950
of St. Charles of mount argus
from the church to the cemetery,

10:51.952 --> 10:53.218
where we honor the dead.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.819
Louise:
And where we'll dedicate

10:54.821 --> 10:56.388
Megan's cenotaph.

10:56.390 --> 10:59.257
Sean: The procession adds
parishioners as it passes by,

10:59.259 --> 11:01.893
and it'll be coming
around to us soon, so...

11:01.895 --> 11:03.261
If you could all
get ready to leave.

11:03.263 --> 11:06.865
Have some soda bread
before we hit the path.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.199
Father Paul is
a lovely man,

11:08.201 --> 11:09.300
but he'll talk
your ears off,

11:09.302 --> 11:11.102
and I don't want you
to starve.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.303
Everyone, stop!

11:13.974 --> 11:16.007
What? What's wrong?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.409
The lake's about to explode.

11:17.411 --> 11:20.045
(Laughter)

11:20.047 --> 11:22.213
That's a new one.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.381
What are you
saying, Walter?

11:23.383 --> 11:25.283
The top water layer
is so hot,

11:25.285 --> 11:26.785
and the bottom layer
is so much cooler

11:26.787 --> 11:28.687
that carbon dioxide
is collecting

11:28.689 --> 11:30.221
at dangerous levels
at the bed of the lake.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.323
It's like a...
A shaken can of soda.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.692
So if anything
disrupts the lake--

11:33.694 --> 11:36.261
a motor, a landslide,
heavy rain--

11:36.263 --> 11:37.996
then the gas will rush
to the top,

11:37.998 --> 11:39.164
and the lake will explode.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.099
And that will send out
a deadly cloud

11:41.101 --> 11:43.168
of carbon dioxide
the size of a football field.

11:43.170 --> 11:46.337
So anyone in its path could die,
could be knocked unconscious,

11:46.339 --> 11:48.339
could suffer
severe brain damage.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.278
Is that like the size
of an American football field,

11:53.280 --> 11:55.313
or like a proper...
Proper football pitch?

11:55.315 --> 11:57.115
(Laughter)
Paige:
Hold on. Hold on.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.283
When is this happening?

11:58.285 --> 12:00.018
I can't be exactly certain,
but soon.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.320
More or less certain
than the time you said

12:02.322 --> 12:04.189
the village would be
struck by an asteroid?

12:04.191 --> 12:07.492
An asteroid did strike,
just in Perth.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.928
He also swore up and down
about an earthquake.

12:09.930 --> 12:13.298
That happened, too.
In Sri Lanka.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.133
I was ten.
My calculations were off.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.301
They're not off now.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.819
Well, then I guess
we're all gonna be

12:17.820 --> 12:19.336
having a drink with
Davy Jones, aren't we?

12:19.339 --> 12:20.772
(Laughter)

12:26.213 --> 12:28.813
I'm trying to save your lives.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.984
I'll stop the lake
from erupting without you.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.055
(Door closes)

12:39.826 --> 12:42.327
This is good soda bread.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.148
Paige:
Holy crap!

13:03.150 --> 13:04.916
You have to see this.

13:06.853 --> 13:08.920
Paige:
This is a lake in Tanzania.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.557
That's gonna happen here?

13:12.559 --> 13:13.458
That's what Walter says.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.260
Map of the town!

13:15.262 --> 13:17.328
All right.

13:17.330 --> 13:20.265
So, we have to tackle this
from two angles.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.934
The first, alleviating the
pressure of the carbon dioxide

13:22.936 --> 13:24.002
at the bottom of the lake.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.436
Second, preparing for
the possibility

13:25.438 --> 13:26.871
that we fail; But to do that,

13:26.873 --> 13:28.840
I will need wind speed
and direction.

13:30.410 --> 13:34.078
Sure hope this first grade
science project saves us.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.414
Readings from your
party cup wind meter.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.517
Sylvester: 30 rotations
over 15 seconds.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.286
Approximate wind velocity:
Eight miles an hour.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.057
Approximate wind direction:
Southwest.

13:46.059 --> 13:51.362
Okay, then this would be
the path of a deadly co2 cloud

13:51.364 --> 13:54.098
within ten minutes of eruption,

13:54.100 --> 13:57.101
and intersecting with
the pattern day procession

13:57.103 --> 13:58.603
at Finn's ravine.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.005
This would kill everyone.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.541
Paige, sly,
get to that procession.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.943
Paige:
The one where

14:04.944 --> 14:06.344
you just said
everyone could die?

14:06.346 --> 14:08.313
You need to convince them all to
direct the route further north.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.215
What if they don't listen to us?
They didn't listen to you.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.783
They've taken a shine to you.
Now, remember,

14:11.784 --> 14:13.350
they don't believe that
the lake's about to explode,

14:13.353 --> 14:14.586
so tell them something good.

14:14.588 --> 14:16.588
Oh, boy.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.524
Walter:
So that leaves us

14:19.526 --> 14:22.160
to find a way
to off-gas the lake.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.361
Cabe:
We're all ears, Walt.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.531
We need a giant straw

14:26.533 --> 14:29.100
to suck the carbon dioxide
from the bottom of the lake.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.369
Steel piping do it? There's
a plumber's truck back there.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.304
Thomas and Connor's.
That will work.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.873
On it.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.507
Okay, cabe,
you need to find a boat

14:36.509 --> 14:38.610
to haul it to the center
of the lake-- and no engines.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.545
A propeller could
disrupt the co2 layer

14:40.547 --> 14:41.546
and cause an eruption.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.114
Good to know.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.425
(Grunts) Sorry, fellas.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.569
Okay.

15:05.672 --> 15:09.007
Condensation catcher.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.975
This was my idea.

15:19.552 --> 15:20.985
What's the scoop, kitten?

15:20.987 --> 15:22.287
It's 4:30.

15:22.289 --> 15:25.590
I am on cabe time,
so I can't sleep past 4:00.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.992
Silver lining is that
i get a lot of work done,

15:27.994 --> 15:30.228
including finalizing
my divorce.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.963
Really?

15:31.964 --> 15:33.697
Which means we can
get married asap.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.134
I've already booked an
appointment at the courthouse,

15:36.136 --> 15:39.604
so by nightfall, we will be
woman and husband.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.306
Wow, that's, uh...

15:41.308 --> 15:43.374
Wow!

15:44.577 --> 15:47.145
(Cell phone ringing)

15:47.147 --> 15:49.681
This is Dr. Curtis. Speak.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.716
Toby, a heat wave has prevented
the carbon dioxide from

15:51.718 --> 15:53.551
turning over in nearby
Clementine lake.

15:53.553 --> 15:56.254
Now, it's about to erupt,
and I need happy's help

15:56.256 --> 15:58.089
in building a system
to off-gas the lake

15:58.091 --> 15:59.424
and prevent limnic eruption.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.192
Who is this?

16:01.194 --> 16:03.728
Toby, I need... I need
weather satellite temperatures

16:03.730 --> 16:05.563
of this lake immediately.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.732
So your family trip's going
kind of how you imagined.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.150
Not now!

16:09.151 --> 16:10.567
Okay, piping is
all connected. What's next?

16:10.570 --> 16:11.669
We need something for ballast

16:11.671 --> 16:14.038
while we bolt down
the engineering.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.607
How 'bout an inner tube?
That's a great idea.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.359
Nice, Tim.

16:18.360 --> 16:20.110
Sounds like you boys are
getting on like gangbusters.

16:20.113 --> 16:22.213
We're fine. Happy?

16:22.215 --> 16:24.349
Now you need a valve
to modulate

16:24.351 --> 16:26.451
the amount of carbon dioxide
saturated water

16:26.453 --> 16:27.685
you pull to the surface.

16:27.687 --> 16:30.221
Too little, and the lake
will still erupt.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.223
Too much, and you'll cause
an eruption.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.624
Give me the pipe specs.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.226
Uh, generic steel piping.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.595
12 inches in diameter,
about 60 feet in length.

16:37.597 --> 16:40.231
You need fishing line that
runs the length of the pipe

16:40.233 --> 16:42.500
tied to something that will
act as a flapper valve.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.570
Uh... toilet seat?

16:45.572 --> 16:46.537
It'll do.

16:46.539 --> 16:47.605
Toby:
I'm in the Irish

16:47.607 --> 16:49.974
national weather satellite.

16:49.975 --> 16:52.342
I'm assuming red thermal imaging
for lake temps is bad?

16:52.345 --> 16:53.344
Very.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.379
That thing's a powder keg

16:54.381 --> 16:55.646
waiting for you
to light the fuse.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.248
Cabe, where are you
with that boat?

16:57.250 --> 16:58.649
On my way.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.052
The only boat I could get
is a little slow.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.254
(Pedals squeaking)

17:05.058 --> 17:07.392
Father, I just feel
that a different path

17:07.394 --> 17:09.027
would be so poignant

17:09.029 --> 17:11.696
considering
how important today is.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.665
Listen, son,
I've told you once,

17:14.667 --> 17:16.734
I'm not changing
tradition.

17:16.736 --> 17:20.104
Especially not for some
American's first pattern day.

17:20.106 --> 17:22.173
Now, get in line.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.512
How'd it go?

17:27.514 --> 17:28.746
The priest hates me.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.315
Then go over his head.
Talk to the crowd.

17:31.317 --> 17:33.818
I can't. I have anxiety
about addressing crowds.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.620
How do you expect
to run for public office

17:35.622 --> 17:36.654
if you can't
address a crowd?

17:36.656 --> 17:38.322
Think of it this way.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.942
Saving everyone's life here

17:40.943 --> 17:43.561
will be good practice for
saving your comic book store.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.666
Excuse me,
everybody, please.

17:48.668 --> 17:49.667
Wait.

17:49.669 --> 17:53.204
Attention. Everybody...

17:53.206 --> 17:56.274
Attention, Irish friends.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.776
First of all,

17:58.778 --> 18:00.845
thank you all so much
for letting me be a part

18:00.847 --> 18:03.147
of today's beautiful ceremonies.

18:03.149 --> 18:05.683
Now, I know

18:05.685 --> 18:07.118
this is against tradition,

18:07.120 --> 18:09.320
but I was wondering if,
instead of going

18:09.322 --> 18:12.323
down through the ravine,
we could change directions

18:12.325 --> 18:13.691
and go north,

18:13.693 --> 18:15.460
towards Megan's
elementary school?

18:15.462 --> 18:17.462
She was so fond of it,
and I would like

18:17.464 --> 18:21.833
to learn and see as much as
i can of her before I leave.

18:21.835 --> 18:25.236
Priest: We follow the path
we've walked for generations.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.738
Now, get back in line and...

18:27.740 --> 18:30.675
Respectfully, father,
he's Megan's husband.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.710
And he was there for her
when she needed him.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.746
And the least we can do is
go a bit out of our way.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.852
(Quietly): Well, that's
a bloody good one.

18:40.854 --> 18:42.620
Bloody Americans.
(Mutters)

18:49.329 --> 18:50.528
That was easy.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.829
All you had
to do was lie

18:51.831 --> 18:53.498
and be emotionally
manipulative.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.500
You're a natural
politician.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.205
Toby: All right, guys,
i got your cell GPS signal

19:01.207 --> 19:02.740
layered over
the satellite image.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.242
I can track your progress.

19:04.243 --> 19:05.743
We'll give you the heads up
when you're in the zone

19:05.745 --> 19:07.245
to lower the pressure pipe.

19:07.246 --> 19:08.746
Walter:
Left, right, left, right,

19:08.748 --> 19:11.415
left, right...
You see, Tim, synchronization

19:11.417 --> 19:12.917
is the key to efficiency.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.352
It's worth remembering.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.454
Yeah. Thanks.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.857
Hey, since we
have a minute,

19:19.859 --> 19:23.861
Paige's job is to keep us
emotionally on track,

19:23.863 --> 19:25.796
and our commitment to each
other is a real testament

19:25.798 --> 19:27.665
to her hard work.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.500
If she wasn't invited
to the wedding,

19:29.502 --> 19:30.801
she might feel slighted.

19:30.803 --> 19:33.604
Postpones us a day,
but whatever.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.773
And if Paige is coming,

19:35.775 --> 19:37.441
we could have a jealousy
issue unless we invite

19:37.443 --> 19:39.777
sly, Walt, cabe, Ralph.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.913
If they want to schlep
to the courthouse, fine.

19:41.915 --> 19:43.381
And if they're coming,
then we should...

19:43.383 --> 19:45.883
Guys! You're in the hot zone.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.585
(Grunts)

19:49.756 --> 19:51.289
No, no, no, no!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

19:51.291 --> 19:52.924
Tim, what are you doing?!

19:52.926 --> 19:55.693
What? She said
we were in the zone.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.528
The hot zone, not the drop zone.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.630
Well, in the military,
"in the hot zone" means go time.

19:59.632 --> 20:00.665
We're not
in the military,

20:00.667 --> 20:02.333
we're in a lake
with a swan boat.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.968
Not good.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.536
Okay, since the pipe
is impossible to retrieve,

20:05.538 --> 20:07.805
efficiency dictates
that we start our work now.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.340
The water should
be deep enough

20:09.342 --> 20:10.575
that our plan will still work.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.842
Now that our
straw's in place,

20:11.844 --> 20:13.594
we need to create suction.

20:13.595 --> 20:15.345
To do that, we first
have to deflate the bladder.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.347
How do we do that?

20:16.349 --> 20:17.682
Jump on it.

20:17.684 --> 20:20.218
Okay.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.752
(Grunts)

20:21.754 --> 20:23.421
(Air sputtering)

20:23.423 --> 20:24.956
(Air sputtering in distance)

20:24.958 --> 20:27.291
Don't feel bad, son.

20:27.293 --> 20:28.926
Her soda bread
gets to everyone.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.597
All right,
off the bladder.

20:32.599 --> 20:33.731
(Grunts)

20:33.733 --> 20:35.433
Now we wait?

20:35.435 --> 20:37.802
The bladder will draw the co2
rich water up through the pipe.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.971
The pressure of the gas below
will keep it flowing,

20:39.973 --> 20:41.439
like a geyser.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.441
And redistribute
the gas-pressurized water

20:43.443 --> 20:44.675
so the lake won't explode.

20:44.677 --> 20:45.977
Exactly.

20:45.979 --> 20:47.712
Should be very soon.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.714
It better be.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.686
If somehow, I'm actually wrong,

20:55.688 --> 20:57.755
like I was with the asteroid
and the earthquake...

20:57.757 --> 20:59.724
You were just a kid.

20:59.726 --> 21:02.393
Wish we'd dropped the device
in the proper part of the lake.

21:02.395 --> 21:03.661
Walt.
Tim: Come on,
give me a break.

21:03.663 --> 21:04.751
All day long,
all you've been talking about

21:04.752 --> 21:05.840
is problem solving
and efficiency.

21:05.841 --> 21:06.929
I was just trying
to be efficient.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.666
This is the last time

21:08.668 --> 21:09.834
I do you a favor.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.702
Go ahead and fail
your homeland exam.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.371
What homeland exam?

21:13.373 --> 21:15.406
Guys! Focus on the plan.

21:18.011 --> 21:20.678
Toby told me to help you
with a non-existent test?

21:20.680 --> 21:22.747
Ralph asked me to pal around
with you in Ireland.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.915
It was a little parent trapping.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.784
Trying to create

21:26.786 --> 21:28.302
some peace in the garage.

21:28.303 --> 21:29.819
Why in the hell would you think
that I need help

21:29.822 --> 21:32.023
with problem solving
and efficiency anyway?

21:32.025 --> 21:34.725
I've built Bridges over ravines
in kandahar in the middle

21:34.727 --> 21:36.827
of a battle zone.
I'm a trained seal.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.929
And yet you believed some,
what, half-baked lie from Toby?

21:38.931 --> 21:40.898
That's how little
you think of me?

21:40.900 --> 21:42.833
I guess so.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.402
But since
we were both duped,

21:44.404 --> 21:45.870
perhaps this could be a detente
to the sniping.

21:46.873 --> 21:48.739
Yeah, sure, whatever.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.875
A little dishonesty
never killed anyone.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.711
We will discuss this, Toby.
Yes, we will.

21:54.781 --> 21:56.547
(Rumbling)
Tim: Uh, guys,

21:56.549 --> 21:58.082
is this a good or a bad thing?

21:59.519 --> 22:01.018
Yeah, it's good, it's good.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.853
We've built a highway
to allow the water

22:02.855 --> 22:05.056
from deeper part of the lake
to get to the top.

22:05.058 --> 22:07.692
Guys, don't break out the cigars
just yet.

22:07.694 --> 22:08.959
I'm getting temp readings
showing the hot zone

22:08.961 --> 22:10.494
getting hotter, not cooler.

22:10.496 --> 22:11.996
My bet, you're drawing
carbon dioxide

22:11.998 --> 22:13.698
out of the lake too fast,

22:13.700 --> 22:15.599
and it's exciting
the rest of the gas pool.

22:15.601 --> 22:17.702
You need to slow the water
or the lake will explode.

22:17.704 --> 22:19.470
That's why you put in
the flapper valve.

22:19.472 --> 22:20.688
Pull it!

22:20.689 --> 22:21.905
Walter:
Shutting the flapper valve.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.008
Come on!

22:24.010 --> 22:25.976
The valve's stuck!

22:25.978 --> 22:27.611
Shut the valve, Walt.

22:27.613 --> 22:29.947
I think we're looking
at a major problem!

22:32.518 --> 22:34.652
Walter:
It's gone slack!

22:34.654 --> 22:35.720
Come on!

22:36.756 --> 22:37.755
(Groans)

22:37.757 --> 22:40.458
Seaweed.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.826
This would not
have been an issue

22:41.828 --> 22:43.894
if we were at the deeper
part of the lake.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.730
Come on, give me a break!

22:45.732 --> 22:47.798
And that's the end
of our peaceful garage.

22:49.102 --> 22:51.702
(Rumbling)

22:51.704 --> 22:54.572
It's gonna be the end
of more than that

22:54.574 --> 22:55.806
if we don't get
the hell out of here!

22:55.808 --> 22:57.908
(Rumbling continues)

22:58.711 --> 23:00.644
Oh, boy.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.155
Everybody in one piece?
Yeah.

23:13.659 --> 23:15.860
Ah, there goes my deposit.

23:15.862 --> 23:18.028
Guys, what I just heard

23:18.030 --> 23:19.764
over my comms
did not sound good.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.699
Is there a deadly
cloud in the air?

23:23.069 --> 23:25.603
Tim:
Not one that we can see.

23:25.605 --> 23:27.938
Carbon dioxide is invisible
to the naked eye.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.073
You need thermal imaging.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.674
Happy?
It is not good.

23:30.676 --> 23:33.144
We are looking at the Godzilla
of gas clouds.

23:33.146 --> 23:35.012
Toby: But it's not heading
towards you, Walter.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.715
Wind direction has shifted
from west to northeast.

23:37.717 --> 23:39.517
Walter:
I put them in harm's way.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.452
They would have been safe
in Finn's ravine.

23:41.454 --> 23:43.187
Yeah, it's heading
right for the cemetery.

23:43.189 --> 23:45.656
Sylvester: You mean the cemetery
we're about to go into?

23:45.658 --> 23:46.857
This cemetery?

23:46.859 --> 23:48.192
How long do we have?

23:48.194 --> 23:50.728
15 minutes, unless the wind
picks up, which it may.

23:50.730 --> 23:52.530
Do you guys have
any good news?

23:52.532 --> 23:54.598
Yeah, if you die,
you'll be conveniently located.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.567
Get everyone
the hell out of there!

23:58.704 --> 23:59.904
Pardon me, father?

23:59.906 --> 24:01.605
Sylvester dodd, hi.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.941
Walter: We'll drive to you now
to evacuate the infirm,

24:03.943 --> 24:06.544
but we have to get the rest
of the town to run south.

24:06.546 --> 24:07.845
We'll be there
as soon as we can,

24:07.847 --> 24:09.647
but we have to drive
around the cloud.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.015
Getting you a route now.

24:11.017 --> 24:13.551
Tim: Why not drive through it,
hold our breath?

24:13.553 --> 24:14.352
There's a seal
technique where...

24:14.353 --> 24:15.152
The Van's engine would choke

24:15.154 --> 24:16.454
on the carbon dioxide.

24:16.456 --> 24:17.555
It would seep in
and we'd choke, too.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.190
Okay, I'm just
throwing out ideas.

24:19.192 --> 24:21.058
If I need something heavy moved,
you're our guy.

24:23.095 --> 24:25.696
Now can you get me a bottle,
some tubing and a funnel?

24:26.799 --> 24:27.765
You know what, Walter?

24:27.767 --> 24:30.134
Hey, hey, hey...
It's all right.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.604
So because of this deadly cloud,

24:33.606 --> 24:35.506
we need to evacuate the cemetery
immediately.

24:35.508 --> 24:36.607
Because the lake exploded?

24:37.777 --> 24:39.710
Wish I could
have seen that.

24:39.712 --> 24:42.480
It would certainly make
this story easier to believe.

24:42.482 --> 24:45.015
Listen, we need to go south,
like, ten minutes ago.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.116
Everybody, come on.

24:46.118 --> 24:47.651
Paige:
Come on.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.220
(Crowd murmuring)

24:51.858 --> 24:54.925
You guys, you need to
take this more seriously.

24:54.927 --> 24:57.061
Like when we redirected
from Finn's ravine.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.829
But that was you asking, dear.

24:58.831 --> 25:02.800
This is from Walter,
and his theories are so...

25:02.802 --> 25:04.502
You know.

25:06.672 --> 25:07.972
I haven't missed
a pattern day in my life,

25:07.974 --> 25:09.573
and I'm not starting today.

25:09.575 --> 25:11.575
Connor: We've got people
to pay our respects to,

25:11.577 --> 25:13.711
like Megan.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.779
But do you understand
you will asphyxiate and die?

25:15.781 --> 25:18.182
Next year,
i will be spending pattern day

25:18.184 --> 25:22.019
for all of you,
if you do not follow me!

25:22.021 --> 25:23.254
Yeah. Let's go.

25:23.256 --> 25:24.722
Pardon me. Pardon me.

25:24.724 --> 25:26.824
(Vehicle approaching)

25:32.732 --> 25:33.831
That's our Van.

25:35.868 --> 25:36.834
What the hell's he done to it?

25:36.836 --> 25:39.036
I will kill the brainiac.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.071
Oh, great, you're
still here.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.540
As I suspected.

25:42.542 --> 25:43.574
Sean:
Walter,

25:43.576 --> 25:44.875
all we can see

25:44.877 --> 25:47.912
are bright red roses
against a crystal blue sky.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.113
So can we drop all this nonsense

25:49.115 --> 25:50.814
about a cloud

25:50.816 --> 25:52.616
and pay our respects
to your sister?

25:52.618 --> 25:55.019
If she were here,
she would listen to me

25:55.021 --> 25:56.854
and she'd want me to
do everything that I can

25:56.856 --> 25:57.855
to save this town!

25:57.857 --> 25:59.123
Save them from what?

26:01.027 --> 26:02.192
Is that a molotov cocktail?

26:03.863 --> 26:05.162
Have you gone insane?

26:05.164 --> 26:08.032
Tobin: The land's a tinder box
from the drought.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.667
You'll burn down the village!

26:09.669 --> 26:11.835
The carbon dioxide will

26:11.837 --> 26:14.305
disperse the oxygen
and extinguish the flame,

26:14.307 --> 26:16.307
proving that it exists!

26:18.778 --> 26:20.578
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

26:22.715 --> 26:23.981
(Crowd gasping)

26:23.983 --> 26:26.717
Tobin:
Our family land!

26:26.719 --> 26:27.885
You'll scorch it to ashes!

26:27.887 --> 26:29.153
Okay, kid.

26:30.323 --> 26:32.756
When's the cloud gonna
put out the flame?

26:32.758 --> 26:34.692
Well, it should have
already by now.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.827
Walter, what
do we do now?

26:36.829 --> 26:38.862
You pompous son of a bitch,

26:38.864 --> 26:40.731
I'm gonna leave you here
with the rest of the dead!

26:40.733 --> 26:41.765
Hey, hey, hey...
Hey, hey, look!

26:41.767 --> 26:42.766
Look, look!

26:42.768 --> 26:44.835
It's starting to Peter out.

26:45.871 --> 26:47.271
We need to start evacuating.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.806
Happy:
Walt, it's too late.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.975
The wind picked up
and the cloud is now covering

26:50.977 --> 26:52.876
the only road leading
to and from the cemetery.

26:52.878 --> 26:54.812
If you go to it,
you will choke and die.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.614
Cabe: Let's just run
as fast as we can

26:56.616 --> 26:57.915
in the opposite direction.
Come on!

26:57.917 --> 27:00.317
We can't.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.953
Cemetery backs up to a quarry.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.824
It's a dead end.

27:06.826 --> 27:07.791
There's no escape.

27:13.032 --> 27:17.234
Keep moving! We've created, at
best, a 1,200-yard head start.

27:17.236 --> 27:19.637
Which, by my calculations,
gives us five minutes

27:19.639 --> 27:21.739
until the cloud
is upon us!

27:21.741 --> 27:23.807
They're exhausted. I don't
think they can keep going.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.175
Even if they could,
it wouldn't matter.

27:25.177 --> 27:26.644
Walter: Okay, so if we can't
run from the cloud,

27:26.646 --> 27:27.911
then we have to neutralize it.

27:27.913 --> 27:29.279
Sylvester:
If only we had magnesium.

27:29.281 --> 27:30.914
That would react

27:30.916 --> 27:33.784
with the carbon dioxide
and turn it into oxygen.

27:33.786 --> 27:34.952
Cabe:
Guessing we'll need more

27:34.954 --> 27:37.154
than the magnesium
in my chewable vitamins.

27:38.124 --> 27:39.823
Bright red roses.

27:40.926 --> 27:42.660
Father, do you put
epsom salts in the soil?

27:42.662 --> 27:45.095
Of course. It makes for larger
blossoms and brighter colors.

27:45.097 --> 27:47.097
I'm guessing epsom salts
are made of magnesium?

27:47.099 --> 27:48.332
Magnesium sulfide.

27:48.334 --> 27:49.867
I have several bags
in the shed.

27:49.869 --> 27:51.168
Lead the way, padre!

27:51.170 --> 27:54.204
Walter, new problem: Based
on the size of the cloud,

27:54.206 --> 27:57.074
we need at least 100 pounds
of epsom salts,

27:57.076 --> 27:59.376
and then we need to deliver it
to the center of the cloud.

27:59.378 --> 28:01.278
If we hit the edge,

28:01.279 --> 28:03.179
the carbon dioxide will
just roll over it, unaffected.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.882
I know we can't run
the epsom salts

28:04.884 --> 28:06.183
into a cloud,
but can we just hold our breath

28:06.185 --> 28:07.384
and-and run it in?

28:07.386 --> 28:09.053
Toby:
Unless you're Oskar svendsen,

28:09.055 --> 28:10.921
Norwegian wunderkind
cyclist,<i> no bueno.</i>

28:10.923 --> 28:12.923
It's impossible
based on your vo2 Max,

28:12.925 --> 28:14.525
your volume of Max oxygen.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.126
No one can hold their breath
long enough because

28:16.128 --> 28:18.929
of the energy required to carry
100 pounds of epsom salts.

28:18.931 --> 28:21.265
Then take this.

28:21.267 --> 28:24.201
Can you and your friends use
my tank to save the village?

28:24.203 --> 28:26.270
Thomas:
Are you having me on?

28:26.272 --> 28:27.838
You will die without that.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.339
Better me than the village.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.008
Toby:
That<i> would</i> work, Walter.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.443
It's not ideal.

28:32.444 --> 28:33.877
No, there-there has
to be a better way.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.245
Are you serious?

28:35.247 --> 28:36.880
You're gonna take
this man's oxygen

28:36.882 --> 28:38.549
for another one
of your crazy ideas?

28:38.550 --> 28:40.217
How would you propose that
we get the salt there, Thomas?

28:40.219 --> 28:43.287
Do you have any notions?
Tim: Actually, I got an idea.

28:43.289 --> 28:44.321
Tim, please,
I'm trying to think.

28:44.323 --> 28:45.155
Paige:
Walter, you need

28:45.157 --> 28:46.256
something heavy moved.

28:46.258 --> 28:47.324
Tim's expertise,

28:50.162 --> 28:50.811
remember?

28:50.812 --> 28:51.461
During Navy seal training,

28:51.464 --> 28:53.430
they taught us a technique
to hold our breath.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.032
Intentionally hyperventilate,

28:55.034 --> 28:56.500
then take a breath
of pure oxygen.

28:56.502 --> 28:58.302
So you flush out
the co2 in your body

28:58.304 --> 29:00.170
and then you preload it
with unconverted oxygen.

29:00.172 --> 29:01.588
Yeah. End result being

29:01.589 --> 29:03.005
you can hold your breath
for minutes longer.

29:03.008 --> 29:04.274
After the initial breath,

29:04.276 --> 29:06.043
you won't need
uncle Tobin's oxygen tank.

29:06.045 --> 29:08.312
Toby: Guys, I hate to rain
on your parade,

29:08.314 --> 29:10.447
but a few additional minutes
isn't gonna be enough time

29:10.449 --> 29:12.983
for you to deliver 100 pounds
of epsom salts

29:12.985 --> 29:14.351
to the center
of the cloud and get back.

29:14.353 --> 29:15.986
It's a one-way trip, timbo.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.521
Not if we split
the burden.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.323
I'm going with you.

29:19.325 --> 29:20.457
Sylvester:
I just did the math.

29:20.459 --> 29:21.458
It could work.

29:21.460 --> 29:22.893
Okay. I'll get us set up.

29:22.895 --> 29:24.228
Happy: Good, 'cause the cloud
is now entering

29:24.230 --> 29:25.996
the cemetery,
and I don't think it's there

29:25.998 --> 29:27.331
to pay its respects.

29:29.168 --> 29:31.502
I don't want to be back
here next pattern day

29:31.504 --> 29:33.403
to remember
another child.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.774
Come back safe.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.480

of the cloud.

30:14.046 --> 30:15.078
You're in the zone.

30:29.094 --> 30:32.095
Is it supposed
to take so long?

30:32.097 --> 30:34.097
Uh, I don't think
any of us have a clue

30:34.099 --> 30:36.099
how long this is
supposed to take.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.903
(Crowd gasping)

30:39.905 --> 30:41.438
Man:
What was that?!

30:41.440 --> 30:44.575
Sylvester: It's the co2 reacting
with the magnesium.

30:44.577 --> 30:46.176
They gonna be okay?

30:46.178 --> 30:49.012
That's another thing we
really don't have a clue about.

How do you get them to stop
picking on you?

31:58.350 --> 31:59.483
Walter, I<i> was</i> the bully.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.385
What?
Look, I was a punk kid.

32:01.387 --> 32:03.587
Okay? The only thing that
finally got me to stop

32:03.589 --> 32:05.188
was getting my ass kicked.

to watch this?

32:35.254 --> 32:37.087
Think we do.

32:50.169 --> 32:52.669
Okay. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What about his left?

uh, rainbow cookies.

39:17.522 --> 39:19.823
This was a great a day.

39:19.825 --> 39:22.125
Looks like a happy memory.

39:22.127 --> 39:25.095
It was the happiest day
of my life.

39:29.835 --> 39:31.835
We going home soon, roomie?

39:33.105 --> 39:35.372
I got you something.

39:37.642 --> 39:38.708
Meat?

39:38.710 --> 39:40.610
It's gammon.

39:40.612 --> 39:43.747
That's a traditional
Irish cut of pork.

39:43.749 --> 39:45.815
I'll fry it up for dinner?

39:48.053 --> 39:50.854
Give me an hour to finish
the chelation treatment.

39:50.856 --> 39:53.056
Okay.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.824
See you soon.

39:57.529 --> 39:59.829
You're a softy.

40:02.968 --> 40:05.835
Be glad I am,
because that is why

40:05.837 --> 40:07.570
you are getting
your big wedding.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.407
Really?

40:10.409 --> 40:12.776
If that grump
can smile at his wedding,

40:12.778 --> 40:14.844
maybe this grump can, too.

40:16.748 --> 40:17.847
(Groans)

40:17.849 --> 40:18.915
Ah...

40:28.760 --> 40:30.093
Walter.

40:30.095 --> 40:32.061
Mm-hmm?

40:34.699 --> 40:36.616
What's this?

40:36.617 --> 40:38.534
Uncle Tobin told me
about the village tradition

40:38.537 --> 40:40.770
of taking a stone
from the bottom of the lake

40:40.772 --> 40:43.940
and giving it to
a family member. It's, uh,

40:43.942 --> 40:46.643
supposed to symbolize that
you'd go to the depths for them.

40:46.645 --> 40:48.912
I remember
the tradition.

40:48.914 --> 40:52.015
Megan brought you and I together
and made us brothers.

40:52.017 --> 40:54.517
But that's not
the end of it.

40:54.519 --> 40:56.119
Toby, happy,

40:56.121 --> 40:58.955
cabe, Paige, Ralph,
e-even Tim.

41:00.125 --> 41:02.892
They're our family.

41:02.894 --> 41:05.462
Blood doesn't make family.

41:05.464 --> 41:07.964
Love makes family.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.870
Anyway...

41:13.872 --> 41:16.706
Tobin told me nobody ever
gave you a stone from the lake.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.708
Sly, you're my family.

41:18.710 --> 41:21.711
Even if you hadn't
have married my sister.

41:26.518 --> 41:29.552
In all honesty, I didn't
get the stone from the lake.

41:29.554 --> 41:30.820
I got it from the shore.

41:30.822 --> 41:33.690
It's the thought that counts.

41:33.692 --> 41:36.025
Yeah.
Yeah.

41:40.131 --> 41:42.732
There was a lot of algae

41:42.734 --> 41:44.234
and bacteria

41:44.236 --> 41:46.669
by the shore, so i-i actually

41:46.671 --> 41:49.172
got it from your
parents' driveway.

41:56.681 --> 41:58.114
I got it from
outside the garage.

41:58.116 --> 41:59.849
I was worried about
taking a stone

41:59.851 --> 42:02.051
through customs.

42:06.758 --> 42:08.791
It still means a lot.

42:12.797 --> 42:16.032
(Door opens, closes)
