(LAUGHS) Funny, right?

00:06.560 --> 00:09.079
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, that is excellent.</font>
It's clever funny, in't it?

00:09.080 --> 00:10.559
<font color="#FFFF00">I'll give it to my date tonight.</font>

00:10.560 --> 00:12.679
<font color="#FFFF00">A guy in the Forum sells 'em</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for five Denari.</font>

00:12.680 --> 00:15.559
Five Denari for a rapey poem?

00:15.560 --> 00:16.999
<font color="#FFFF00">It's not rapey, it's cheeky.</font>

00:17.000 --> 00:18.759
<font color="#FFFF00">This is what Lupercalia's all about.</font>

00:18.760 --> 00:21.159
Well, no. Lupercalia
is about cynical shysters

00:21.160 --> 00:22.559
flogging tat to idiots -

00:22.560 --> 00:24.519
or restaurants
hiking up their prices

00:24.520 --> 00:26.319
with hateful love-themed menus.

00:26.320 --> 00:28.079
<font color="#FFFF00">Like what you're doing?</font>
Correct.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.599
And anyone stupid enough
to go out on Lupercalia

00:30.600 --> 00:32.679
deserves everything they get.

00:32.680 --> 00:35.359
<font color="#FFFF00">Methinks the real reason</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that you hate Lupercalia</font>

00:35.360 --> 00:37.759
<font color="#FFFF00">is that you're a sad wanker</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">who can't get a date.</font>

00:37.760 --> 00:39.999
I can get a date, mate.
I just didn't, on purpose.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.359
<font color="#FFFF00">Who's the lucky lady, then?</font>
Her name's Tabitha

00:42.360 --> 00:43.879
and according to her profile,

00:43.880 --> 00:45.959
she likes music, travel
and men with beards.

00:45.960 --> 00:49.919
<font color="#FFFF00">Did you meet her through an agency?</font>
Big time. And she is gorge.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.599
Check out the picture.
<font color="#FFFF00">OK.</font>

00:51.600 --> 00:54.639
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, yeah, the picture's hot</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but she might be...not.</font>

00:54.640 --> 00:56.479
What?
How would that work, you moron?

00:56.480 --> 00:59.039
<font color="#FFFF00">No-one actually looks like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">their profile pics, mate.</font>

00:59.040 --> 01:01.439
<font color="#FFFF00">She's probably some</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">dog-faced swamp monster.</font>

01:01.440 --> 01:03.559
No, she's hot. She'll be hot.
She has to be.

01:03.560 --> 01:06.519
Please be hot.

01:06.520 --> 01:09.119

Yeah, sure. (CLEARS THROAT)

01:46.880 --> 01:50.159
Mate, Lupercalia is like
a graveyard for relationships.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.639
The pressure for romance
is way too intense.

01:52.640 --> 01:55.239
<font color="#FFFF00">Especially at these prices.</font>
By the end of the night,

01:55.240 --> 01:57.399
there's all these teary,
newly-single women

looking to do something stupid.

Exactly.

02:01.240 --> 02:03.159
It's literally never not worked.

02:03.160 --> 02:04.999
Trust me, you should try it.
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah.</font>

02:05.000 --> 02:07.440
<font color="#FFFF00">I think that might be</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">too cynical even for me.</font>

Gloria. Hey!

02:24.000 --> 02:26.079
Didn't see you there.
<font color="#FFFF00">Pleased I caught you.</font>

02:26.080 --> 02:28.679
<font color="#FFFF00">What you up to later on?</font>
I er...don't know.

02:28.680 --> 02:29.959
Why do you ask?

02:29.960 --> 02:32.159
<font color="#FFFF00">Wondered if you fancied</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">meeting for dinner?</font>

02:32.160 --> 02:34.839
Oh! Sure, yeah.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.840
Sounds great.

Of course it's not a date.

02:41.480 --> 02:44.319
<font color="#FFFF00">She asked you to dinner</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on Lupercalia!</font>

02:44.320 --> 02:45.879
She said meeting for dinner.

02:45.880 --> 02:47.239
It's probably just a meeting

02:47.240 --> 02:49.479
because she wants me
to sort out her damp patch.

02:49.480 --> 02:52.919
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, damn right, she does.</font>
No, obviously not that one.

02:52.920 --> 02:56.159
The boring one in the wall which
she'll try and make me pay for.

02:56.160 --> 02:58.159
<font color="#FFFF00">There's always been</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">this sexy, tense vibe</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">Grumio, isn't that right?</font>

03:00.600 --> 03:02.679
He gets tense round all women,
to be honest.

03:02.680 --> 03:05.119
<font color="#FFFF00">He is right.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">That hardly singles her out.</font>

03:05.120 --> 03:06.639
Ask her if it's a date.
<font color="#FFFF00">What?</font>

03:06.640 --> 03:08.319
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not just gonna ask her.</font>

03:08.320 --> 03:10.119

<font color="#FFFF00">and damage my negotiating position</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if the answer turns out to be no.</font>

03:13.480 --> 03:16.759
You'll have to look for clues.
Like, how much flesh is on show?

03:16.760 --> 03:19.839
Is she getting lashed?
If she invites you back to hers.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.199
You just need to, like,
vibe it out, man, all right?

03:22.200 --> 03:25.159
<font color="#FFFF00">Mm. OK. You'll have to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">cover for me here, then.</font>

03:25.160 --> 03:26.439
Fine by me.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.319
More sad stunners
for the rebound king.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Hang on, not fine by me.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Why should he get the night off?</font>

03:30.960 --> 03:32.399
Cos he's got a hot date.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.399
<font color="#FFFF00">It might just be a hot meeting.</font>

03:34.400 --> 03:37.399
Grumio, get asked out by anyone
or anything, and you can have

03:37.400 --> 03:39.759
the night off.
<font color="#FFFF00">Sweet, I'll ask myself out.</font>

03:39.760 --> 03:40.999
No, that doesn't count.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.399
<font color="#FFFF00">Grumio, would you like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to come for dinner tonight?</font>

03:43.400 --> 03:46.119
<font color="#FFFF00">Why, yes, Grumio, I'd love to.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I thought you'd never ask.</font>

03:46.120 --> 03:47.639
Great idea, Grumio.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.959
Maybe you'll invite yourself
back for a nightcap

03:49.960 --> 03:51.879
and try and get lucky.
<font color="#FFFF00">I will, actually.</font>

03:51.880 --> 03:53.479

Cashing in on the festivities,
I see.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.599
<font color="#FFFF00">Always. You out tonight, are you?</font>

04:10.600 --> 04:14.119
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, I'd figured you would spend</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Lupercalia at home,</font>

04:15.880 --> 04:19.519
Well, the night is young but I'm
actually meeting someone first.

04:19.519 --> 04:21.759
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, well, then,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you've gotta take her a rose.</font>

04:21.760 --> 04:23.799
<font color="#FFFF00">It's the done thing.</font>
No, I know.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.519
But I'm not sure
if it's a date or not?

04:25.520 --> 04:29.039
She owns the laundry next door
and we've got some damp to sort out.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.439
And she invited me for dinner
and didn't mention it.

04:31.440 --> 04:34.119
So I don't really know
where I stand, rose-wise.

04:34.120 --> 04:36.959
What do you reckon,
as a sort of woman?

04:36.960 --> 04:41.199
<font color="#FFFF00">I see. I think it is a date</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and you should take her a rose.</font>

04:41.200 --> 04:43.399
Yeah, but you
would say that, wouldn't you,

04:43.400 --> 04:45.679
cos you're selling roses?
So, tell you what,

04:45.680 --> 04:47.999
I'll pay for one anyway,
so you can be honest.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.079
<font color="#FFFF00">Right, now I'm thinking</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that it isn't a date</font>

04:51.080 --> 04:52.919
<font color="#FFFF00">and you shouldn't take her a rose.</font>

04:52.920 --> 04:54.959
Hm, you see, again I think
you would say that

04:54.960 --> 04:57.279
because you get to keep
the rose and the money.

04:57.280 --> 04:59.959
So, tell you what, I'll take it
anyway, just to be safe.

04:59.960 --> 05:02.759
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, whatever it is,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you're sure to fuck it up.</font>

don't toddle on, toddle in.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.480
GRUMIO: Waiter!

07:47.480 --> 07:49.999
<font color="#FFFF00">All right, Grumio? Date going well?</font>

07:50.000 --> 07:51.599
Well, the company's top-drawer

07:51.600 --> 07:53.639
but the service
is a bit of a let down.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.759
I'm still waiting on
my second sharing plate.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.839
<font color="#FFFF00">OK.</font>
Excuse me.

07:57.840 --> 08:00.039
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, hello. How can I help?</font>

08:00.040 --> 08:02.399
Which way's the toilet?
There's no signs in here.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.239
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, there's no need. You just</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">follow the yellowy stain.</font>

08:05.240 --> 08:07.239
<font color="#FFFF00">Look!</font>
Waiter!

08:07.240 --> 08:09.000
I am waiting.
<font color="#FFFF00">Just a sec!</font>

08:10.600 --> 08:12.879
<font color="#FFFF00">So, you two been together long or...</font>

08:12.880 --> 08:14.879
Oh, yes. 12 years.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.039
<font color="#FFFF00">12 years, whoa!</font>

08:17.040 --> 08:19.639
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, that is long.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Too long in a way.</font>

08:19.640 --> 08:22.439
Sorry, how do you mean?
<font color="#FFFF00">The spark's probably gone.</font>

08:22.440 --> 08:24.679
I wouldn't say that.
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, I know.</font>

08:24.680 --> 08:27.319
<font color="#FFFF00">You're stuck in a rut of crap sex,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">arguing about money,</font>

08:27.320 --> 08:29.119
<font color="#FFFF00">wondering where it's all going.</font>

08:29.120 --> 08:31.839
Hey, cloth ears!
Fetch me my grub now!

08:31.840 --> 08:33.480
<font color="#FFFF00">Get it yourself, you lazy prick!</font>

08:37.000 --> 08:39.318
<font color="#FFFF00">It's fine.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">He's not a proper customer.</font>

08:39.320 --> 08:40.558
Sorry, yes, of course.

08:40.559 --> 08:43.239
<font color="#FFFF00">You were saying your relationship's</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">dead in the water?</font>

08:43.240 --> 08:45.639
I was thinking of doing
something quite bold.

08:45.640 --> 08:47.639
<font color="#FFFF00">Exactly. Get out whilst you can.</font>

08:47.640 --> 08:49.759
And asking her to marry me.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.079
<font color="#FFFF00">You sure you wanna do that?</font>

08:51.080 --> 08:52.239
A hundred per cent.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.839
In fact, sorry, you couldn't
do me a favour, chum,

08:54.840 --> 08:56.839
and conceal this in the dessert?

08:56.840 --> 08:59.039
I'd really love it
to be a surprise, you see.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.599
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, no, I'll be happy to.</font>

09:00.600 --> 09:02.439
<font color="#FFFF00">Ah, what a lovely gesture.</font>

09:02.440 --> 09:05.280
And you can forget about a tip,
you lazy dickhead.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.479
(GLORIA CHUCKLES)

09:08.480 --> 09:11.239
<font color="#FFFF00">Now, blood is a fucker.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">If you don't get it early enough,</font>

09:11.240 --> 09:12.759
<font color="#FFFF00">that ain't never coming out.</font>

09:12.760 --> 09:14.839
<font color="#FFFF00">If someone comes in</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with a bloody tunic,</font>

09:14.840 --> 09:17.519
<font color="#FFFF00">I usually suggest they try</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and bleed over the whole thing</font>

09:17.520 --> 09:19.239
<font color="#FFFF00">just to even it out.</font>
(LAUGHS)

09:19.240 --> 09:22.079
<font color="#FFFF00">Now, semen stains,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">much easier, of course.</font>

09:22.080 --> 09:25.719
You can just scrape it off
once it's dry, I imagine.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.919
<font color="#FFFF00">Was that your adolescence,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">staining and scraping?</font>

09:27.920 --> 09:30.279
Interspersed with
the odd Greek lesson, yeah.

09:30.280 --> 09:32.919
<font color="#FFFF00">I bet the girls were</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">beating your door down.</font>

09:32.920 --> 09:35.239
Er... My mum was
beating my door down.

09:35.240 --> 09:38.520
The girls were elsewhere.
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, more fool them.</font>

09:41.040 --> 09:42.759
The menu for you, madam.
<font color="#FFFF00">Thank you.</font>

09:42.760 --> 09:44.599
For you, sir.
<font color="#FFFF00">Thanks.</font>

09:44.600 --> 09:47.039
I'll leave that with you.
<font color="#FFFF00">Cheers.</font>

09:47.040 --> 09:48.479
It's a Lupercalia menu.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.879
Oh, shit, I completely forgot
that was today.

09:50.880 --> 09:53.639
No wonder this place
is full of couples. Ha!

09:53.640 --> 09:55.119
Oooh.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.839
You all right?
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah.</font>

09:56.840 --> 09:59.439
What you doing down there?

09:59.440 --> 10:01.639
<font color="#FFFF00">Aargh! Fuck!</font>
Ooh!

10:01.640 --> 10:02.960
What's happening?
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh!</font>

10:04.080 --> 10:07.239
<font color="#FFFF00">I think something</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">just stabbed me in my...organ.</font>

10:07.240 --> 10:08.639
Stabbed? What stabbed you?

10:08.640 --> 10:10.879
<font color="#FFFF00">I think it must be a splinter</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">from the chair.</font>

10:10.880 --> 10:12.519
<font color="#FFFF00">Cor, it really stings.</font>

10:12.520 --> 10:14.519
Ah, shit,
I hope it's still functional.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.039
(SHE LAUGHS)

10:16.040 --> 10:19.359
Look, these shitbags have hiked up
the prices for Lupercalia anyway.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.439
Why don't we
just go back to my place?

10:21.440 --> 10:24.559
I'll rustle us something up.
You can sort out your organ.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.359
<font color="#FFFF00">Back to your place?</font>
Mm, yeah.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.360
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, great.</font>

10:31.600 --> 10:34.679
One passionate pudding,
two spoons.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.600
<font color="#FFFF00">Thank you. Thanks so much.</font>

10:39.760 --> 10:42.119
Hm. No! I don't like it.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.679
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, sorry.</font>

10:43.680 --> 10:46.519
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, do push on if you can, babe,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">cos...</font>

10:46.520 --> 10:48.079
I don't like it, Theo, I just said.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.239
It's rank.
<font color="#FFFF00">Sure, no, absolutely. Sorry.</font>

10:50.240 --> 10:52.559
<font color="#FFFF00">I...I tell you what.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Why don't I dig in,</font>

10:52.560 --> 10:55.359
<font color="#FFFF00">see what's in there.</font>

10:55.360 --> 10:57.360
<font color="#FFFF00">Mm. (CHUCKLES)</font>

11:01.280 --> 11:05.119
<font color="#FFFF00">Sorry! Sorry! Is this definitely the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">right passionate pudding, waiter?</font>

11:05.120 --> 11:07.639
Yeah, should be.
<font color="#FFFF00">Try and swap it for cheese.</font>

11:07.640 --> 11:09.159
Er...
<font color="#FFFF00">Theo!</font>

11:09.160 --> 11:11.119
Sorry. One sec, babe.
I just...

11:11.120 --> 11:14.199
I thought it had
a special ingredient in it.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.999
A very expensive ingredient.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.839
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, I know.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I put it in myself and then I...</font>

11:19.840 --> 11:22.039
Oh, I love you too, Grumio.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.679
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh!

11:23.680 --> 11:25.719
Don't tease me now. Ohhh!

11:25.720 --> 11:27.080
Mmmm!

11:29.533 --> 11:31.532
<font color="#FFFF00">You greedy bastard, Grumio!</font>

11:31.533 --> 11:33.652
You were the one
who told me to get me own food.

11:33.653 --> 11:36.892
That must've been some budget bling
cos it slid straight down.

11:36.893 --> 11:38.292
Didn't even touch the sides.

11:38.293 --> 11:40.332
<font color="#FFFF00">That ring belonged to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">my late grandmother!</font>

11:40.333 --> 11:42.892
Theo! What are you doing?

11:42.893 --> 11:45.212
I'm sitting here like a lemon!
<font color="#FFFF00">One sec, babe.</font>

11:45.213 --> 11:47.732
<font color="#FFFF00">Just talking through...</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">cheese options.</font>

11:47.733 --> 11:49.652
Oh, shitters!

11:49.653 --> 11:52.212
Right. I need to get
that ring back, buster!

11:52.213 --> 11:53.852
<font color="#FFFF00">All right, chill!</font>

11:53.853 --> 11:55.412
<font color="#FFFF00">Lucky for you your ring's inside</font>

11:55.413 --> 11:57.652
<font color="#FFFF00">one of the fastest digestive systems</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in Rome.</font>

11:57.653 --> 11:59.972
It's true. His gut
is an absolute shit storm.

11:59.973 --> 12:01.572
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, so what's the plan?</font>

12:01.573 --> 12:05.213
Grab them prunes and that colander
and meet me in the bogs.

12:06.453 --> 12:09.572
<font color="#FFFF00">Hey, I'll keep her occupied.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Don't you worry.</font>

12:09.573 --> 12:12.932
<font color="#FFFF00">This can still be a great</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Lupercalia, for everyone.</font>

12:12.933 --> 12:16.453
Thank you. Sorry,
that's jolly decent of you.

12:23.773 --> 12:25.172
<font color="#FFFF00">Toilet's down the hall.</font>

12:25.173 --> 12:27.012
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you want me to give you a hand?</font>

12:27.013 --> 12:29.653
Er...I can handle it.

12:32.253 --> 12:34.452
Aargh! Aargh!

12:34.453 --> 12:36.852
You little prick.
<font color="#FFFF00">What?</font>

12:36.853 --> 12:40.172
Oh, hello. Who are you?

12:40.173 --> 12:42.012
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm Barney. Gloria's son.</font>

12:42.013 --> 12:44.372
<font color="#FFFF00">Who are you?</font>
Son?

12:44.373 --> 12:46.012
OK, erm...

12:46.013 --> 12:48.853
Well, I'm Marcus. Gloria's...

12:49.893 --> 12:51.692
Actually I'm not
entirely sure who I am

12:51.693 --> 12:52.932
in relation to your mum.

12:52.933 --> 12:55.692
She hasn't said anything, has she,
about what she's doing?

12:55.693 --> 12:57.212
<font color="#FFFF00">She said she was out for dinner.</font>

12:57.213 --> 12:58.572
Uh-huh, OK.

12:58.573 --> 13:01.292
I knew that.
And does she do that a lot?

13:01.293 --> 13:04.372
Have dinners with men?
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you calling my mum a slag?</font>

13:04.373 --> 13:06.332
No, I'm not calling her anything.

13:06.333 --> 13:08.972
I'm just asking if she's...

13:08.973 --> 13:10.172
<font color="#FFFF00">What?</font>

13:10.173 --> 13:12.172
She's giving off
a lot of mixed signals.

13:12.173 --> 13:14.452
I thought if you knew
whether it was a date or...

13:14.453 --> 13:16.932
<font color="#FFFF00">It isn't.</font>
Mm-hm, OK.

13:16.933 --> 13:19.612
Why do you say that?
<font color="#FFFF00">You're not her type.</font>

13:19.613 --> 13:21.772
<font color="#FFFF00">She likes big tough guys,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">not weedy pussies.</font>

13:21.773 --> 13:24.692
(LAUGHS) I am not a weedy pussy,
thank you very much.

13:24.693 --> 13:27.612
<font color="#FFFF00">I'll tell her</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you don't know if it's a date.</font>
Please don't.

13:27.613 --> 13:29.932
<font color="#FFFF00">And you were playing</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with your dick. </font>I wasn't.

13:29.933 --> 13:32.412
I was extricating my dick
from a rose thorn.

13:32.413 --> 13:34.412
<font color="#FFFF00">Ha! That's even better.</font>
What? No.

13:34.413 --> 13:37.052
You will not tell your mum.
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, yeah? Or what?</font>

13:37.053 --> 13:38.372
<font color="#FFFF00">What you gonna do about it?</font>

13:38.373 --> 13:41.252
<font color="#FFFF00">Whine at me? </font>No, I'll...
<font color="#FFFF00">With your weedy, whiney voice?</font>

13:41.253 --> 13:43.972
I'll rip your tongue out
and shove it up your arse!

13:43.973 --> 13:46.052
<font color="#FFFF00">What?</font>
That's right.

13:46.053 --> 13:49.173
I'll make you lick your own bum,
you dirty little...boy.

13:50.293 --> 13:52.253
Not so tough now, are ya?

13:55.893 --> 13:57.692
<font color="#FFFF00">It just won't do.</font>

13:57.693 --> 13:59.452
<font color="#FFFF00">I mean, what is he even doing</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in there?</font>

13:59.453 --> 14:02.132
Dunno. I think he's got some
business with the little guy

14:02.133 --> 14:05.332
from the other table. It's lucky
I'm here, though, to fill in.

14:05.333 --> 14:07.572
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, this is so typical of Theo.</font>

14:07.573 --> 14:08.932
Oh! Completely.

14:08.933 --> 14:10.092
Men!

14:10.093 --> 14:11.652
<font color="#FFFF00">Expecting me to just wait around</font>

14:11.653 --> 14:14.812
<font color="#FFFF00">while he parks the chariot</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">or goes to work.</font>

14:14.813 --> 14:17.372
<font color="#FFFF00">All my friends are married by now.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">But no, not me.</font>

14:17.373 --> 14:20.252
<font color="#FFFF00">Yet another Lupercalia</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">where I go home without a ring.</font>

14:20.253 --> 14:23.452
<font color="#FFFF00">I mean, it's not on, is it?</font>
It's criminal is what it is.

14:23.453 --> 14:24.652
A gorgeous girl like you.

14:24.653 --> 14:27.772
If he's not serious about you,
you should just cut him loose.

14:27.773 --> 14:30.332
<font color="#FFFF00">I mean, I always knew</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it was gonna be rocky for us.</font>

14:30.333 --> 14:32.572
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm an Aries, Theo's a Capricorn.</font>

14:32.573 --> 14:36.492
<font color="#FFFF00">I didn't expect him to just take</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">some small man to the toilets.</font>

14:36.493 --> 14:39.372
What, sorry? You're an Aries?
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm a classic Aries.</font>

14:39.373 --> 14:41.492
<font color="#FFFF00">Why?</font>
Because I'm an Aries.

14:41.493 --> 14:44.532
Just today I was thinking,
I never meet any other Arieses.

14:44.533 --> 14:47.013
Wow! Finally.

14:48.613 --> 14:50.613
<font color="#FFFF00">GRUMIO: Prune.</font>

14:52.573 --> 14:55.372
I mean, do I actually
have to be here holding this?

14:55.373 --> 14:57.692
<font color="#FFFF00">You do, yeah.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I like having a target.</font>

14:57.693 --> 14:59.092
Sorry. Right, of course.

14:59.093 --> 15:01.812
I'll be honest, this isn't
really the kind of Lupercalia

15:01.813 --> 15:03.452
I had in mind.
<font color="#FFFF00">You're telling me!</font>

15:03.453 --> 15:05.012
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm meant to be on a date night.</font>

15:05.013 --> 15:07.892
I should've proposed to her
years ago but I dithered.

15:07.893 --> 15:10.812
I wanted to wait until I could
afford an apartment but...

15:10.813 --> 15:12.812
Oh, Jove. Holy Jove!

15:12.813 --> 15:16.212
I've buggered it all up!
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, shut it, will ya!</font>

15:16.213 --> 15:18.212
<font color="#FFFF00">You're making me tense.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I need to be loose.</font>

15:18.213 --> 15:20.332
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

15:20.333 --> 15:22.733
I just don't think
I can live without her.

15:23.973 --> 15:26.132
<font color="#FFFF00">Better get this ring out me guts,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">hadn't we?</font>

15:26.133 --> 15:27.652
Yes, please, thank you.

15:27.653 --> 15:30.452
Sorry. You really are being
an absolute star about all this.

15:30.453 --> 15:32.092
<font color="#FFFF00">I am, yeah.</font>

15:32.093 --> 15:34.532
<font color="#FFFF00">Maybe give me back a rub</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and see if it helps along a bit.</font>

15:34.533 --> 15:37.252
Yes, of course. Sorry.

15:37.253 --> 15:39.613
<font color="#FFFF00">Hm. And pop in another prune.</font>

15:45.693 --> 15:48.212
He's a sweet boy. Well, he can be.

15:48.213 --> 15:50.372
Given all the aggro
over the last few years

15:50.373 --> 15:52.892
between me
and his dickhead father.

15:52.893 --> 15:54.892
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, I'd love to meet him one day.</font>

15:54.893 --> 15:57.412
<font color="#FFFF00">Er... Barney,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">not his dickhead father.</font>

15:57.413 --> 15:59.492
I think you'd get on well,
you and Barney.

15:59.493 --> 16:01.252
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, yeah, I'm sure we would.</font>

16:01.253 --> 16:02.732
<font color="#FFFF00">I love kids.</font>
Well, yeah.

16:02.733 --> 16:04.412
I guess you were one quite recently.

16:04.413 --> 16:07.292
(BOTH LAUGH)

16:07.293 --> 16:09.012
Look, sorry to be blunt,

16:09.013 --> 16:11.612
but do you mind if we take this
into the bedroom?

16:11.613 --> 16:14.452
<font color="#FFFF00">The...er... Yeah!</font>

16:14.453 --> 16:16.012
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, well, why not?</font>

16:16.013 --> 16:18.413
Ssh! Barney's sleeping.
<font color="#FFFF00">OK.</font>

16:20.453 --> 16:22.772
Here, look! It's the damp patch.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.212
<font color="#FFFF00">Ah!</font>

16:24.213 --> 16:26.453
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes. Of course.</font>

16:27.693 --> 16:30.372
Can you feel it?
<font color="#FFFF00">I...er...</font>

16:30.373 --> 16:34.532
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes.</font>
Isn't it soft and warm?

16:34.533 --> 16:36.532
<font color="#FFFF00">Hm. Yep.</font>

16:36.533 --> 16:38.612
It's opened up gaps in the masonry.

16:38.613 --> 16:41.052
You can actually fit
a finger inside it.

16:41.053 --> 16:42.892
It's just so wet, isn't it?

16:42.893 --> 16:45.572
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, it's really wet.</font>

16:45.573 --> 16:48.012
(DOOR SLAMS)

16:48.013 --> 16:50.652
Barney?
Barney's gone! Barney!

16:50.653 --> 16:53.812
Marcus, come here quickly!
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah. Yeah, just one minute!</font>

16:53.813 --> 16:55.813
Barney? Barney!

17:00.853 --> 17:02.932
<font color="#FFFF00">This is crazy! What are we doing?</font>

17:02.933 --> 17:04.531
We're just following our stars.

17:04.532 --> 17:07.811
It's written that me and you
meet and have sex in the cellar.

17:07.813 --> 17:10.932
<font color="#FFFF00">I can't. Not without</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">breaking up with Theo first.</font>

17:10.933 --> 17:13.452
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm too moral.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I really can't cheat on him.</font>

17:13.453 --> 17:15.531
Yeah, you can. It's easy.

17:15.532 --> 17:17.291
You can't dump the guy
on Lupercalia.

17:17.292 --> 17:19.852
That's well harsh.
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, you're right.</font>

17:19.853 --> 17:22.092
<font color="#FFFF00">We'll just have to wait</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">until tomorrow.</font>

17:22.093 --> 17:24.092
Ah, no, OK,
you were right before.

17:24.093 --> 17:25.492
You should dump him now.

17:25.492 --> 17:29.852
<font color="#FFFF00">Barney! Barney!</font>
Barney!

17:29.853 --> 17:31.412
MARCUS: Barnabus!

17:31.413 --> 17:36.172
Ah, I mean, why would he
just run off like that?

17:36.173 --> 17:38.572
<font color="#FFFF00">He's having a tough time</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">at school recently.</font>

17:38.573 --> 17:40.612
<font color="#FFFF00">I can't afford to get him</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the latest sandals</font>

17:40.613 --> 17:42.012
<font color="#FFFF00">or the right abacus,</font>

17:42.013 --> 17:43.612
<font color="#FFFF00">so he's been targeted</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">by bullies.</font>

17:43.613 --> 17:47.092
<font color="#FFFF00">Honestly, the things they say -</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">just atrocious.</font>

17:47.093 --> 17:49.572
<font color="#FFFF00">Really violent, graphic threats.</font>

17:49.573 --> 17:52.852
Oh, dear, that's... I hate that!

17:52.853 --> 17:54.452
If it's true, of course.

17:54.453 --> 17:56.692
He might be making it up.
That does happen.

17:56.693 --> 17:59.972
<font color="#FFFF00">It's made him wet the bed again.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">He's not making that up.</font>

17:59.973 --> 18:02.612
<font color="#FFFF00">I've had more than one damp patch</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to deal with recently.</font>

18:02.613 --> 18:05.252
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, look, about that -

18:05.253 --> 18:06.692
the wall, I'll pay for it.

18:06.693 --> 18:09.532
You've clearly got enough
on your plate as it is so...

18:09.533 --> 18:11.732
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, thank you, Marcus.</font>

18:11.733 --> 18:14.293
<font color="#FFFF00">That is so sweet of you.</font>

18:15.853 --> 18:18.452
Roses! Fancy a rose, do you?

18:18.453 --> 18:21.652
Oh! It's you again, beaky.

18:21.653 --> 18:23.252
You want another rose

18:23.253 --> 18:26.932
or is it time you started
wanking and crying?

18:26.933 --> 18:29.572
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, I've no idea</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what that's about.</font>

18:29.573 --> 18:31.292
<font color="#FFFF00">Weird woman.</font>
Come on.

18:31.293 --> 18:33.293
I think I know where he is.

18:36.453 --> 18:38.252
<font color="#FFFF00">Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is the gents.</font>

18:38.253 --> 18:40.452
<font color="#FFFF00">You shouldn't be in here.</font>
Oh, by Jove! Theo!

18:40.453 --> 18:42.172
<font color="#FFFF00">Babe, wait. Sorry, I can explain.</font>

18:42.173 --> 18:43.972
It's too late. It's over.

18:43.973 --> 18:45.852
I've put up with this shit
for 12 years

18:45.853 --> 18:49.372
and then you just abandon me on
Lupercalia, in some skanky bar?

18:49.373 --> 18:52.092
<font color="#FFFF00">All right, it's not that bad.</font>
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

18:52.093 --> 18:54.852
<font color="#FFFF00">To play some sicko sex game</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with this tiny diner?</font>

18:54.853 --> 18:56.092
You what? Sex game?

18:56.093 --> 18:58.052
What kind of sex game
would this be?

18:58.053 --> 18:59.732
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't want to know.</font>

18:59.733 --> 19:01.452
Babe, no, it's nothing like that.

19:01.453 --> 19:04.692
He swallowed a ring I put in
the pudding to propose to you with.

19:04.693 --> 19:07.052
We're trying to coax it out.
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, come on!</font>

19:07.053 --> 19:08.612
<font color="#FFFF00">That's a bit far-fetched, innit?</font>

19:08.613 --> 19:10.732
What? You know
that's what's happening.

19:10.733 --> 19:13.492
<font color="#FFFF00">He's desperate. He'll say</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">anything to string you along.</font>

19:13.493 --> 19:15.252
I know. Capricorn scum.

19:15.253 --> 19:16.732
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, for Jove's sake!</font>

(METALLIC CLINK)
<font color="#FFFF00">Ohh!</font>

19:21.293 --> 19:23.932
<font color="#FFFF00">Pick that one out.</font>

19:23.933 --> 19:26.372
It's in here. Look!
The ring, it's in here.

19:26.373 --> 19:29.412
<font color="#FFFF00">What? No, is it?</font>
I think my ring's in there an' all.

19:29.413 --> 19:32.492
Will you two please sort this out?
You're perfect for each other.

19:32.493 --> 19:34.572
You're all like,
"This won't do, Theo."

19:34.573 --> 19:36.612
And you're like,
"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry."

19:36.613 --> 19:39.252
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, I suppose we are a bit.</font>

19:39.253 --> 19:40.973

19:42.213 --> 19:44.692
Flora Antonia Modius...

19:44.693 --> 19:47.412
Not exactly
how I planned to do this but...

19:47.413 --> 19:49.772
Will you marry me?
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes!</font>

19:49.773 --> 19:52.452
<font color="#FFFF00">I will!</font>
What? Oh!

19:52.453 --> 19:55.652
<font color="#FFFF00">I'd give it a rinse first.</font>
Yes. Good idea.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.492
Sorry.

19:57.493 --> 20:00.332
<font color="#FFFF00">Sorry if the evening</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">hasn't gone as expected, Marcus.</font>

20:00.333 --> 20:04.052
No, really, I wasn't quite sure
what to expect, to be honest.

20:04.053 --> 20:05.492
(DOG BARKS)

20:05.493 --> 20:07.372
So, is this a friend's house or...

20:07.373 --> 20:10.292
<font color="#FFFF00">No, it's his dad's.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Been avoiding him recently.</font>

20:10.293 --> 20:12.972
<font color="#FFFF00">We keep arguing about how</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to deal with Barney's bullies.</font>

20:12.973 --> 20:16.372
Right, well, diplomacy is
always the best policy, I think.

20:16.373 --> 20:17.492
<font color="#FFFF00">Me too!</font>

20:17.493 --> 20:20.332
<font color="#FFFF00">Unfortunately, he would prefer</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to beat the shite out of 'em.</font>

20:20.333 --> 20:22.972
MAN: Down, Pluto! In your bed now!

20:22.973 --> 20:25.053
Down, boy!
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, maybe I should go.</font>

20:26.333 --> 20:28.852
(SCOFFS)
I wondered when you'd show up.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.132
<font color="#FFFF00">Hello, Cyrus.</font>

20:30.133 --> 20:32.412
<font color="#FFFF00">Is Barney here?</font>
Might be.

20:32.413 --> 20:35.252
Who's this pecker?
<font color="#FFFF00">Barney! Come here, please!</font>

20:35.253 --> 20:36.692
This your new boyfriend, is it?

20:36.693 --> 20:38.652
Been on a little date together,
have you?

20:38.653 --> 20:40.532
<font color="#FFFF00">It's actually none of your business.</font>

20:40.533 --> 20:43.092
Well, no, really, it's fine.
You can tell him.

20:43.093 --> 20:45.252
Maybe you should tell him.
<font color="#FFFF00">That's him, Dad.</font>

20:45.253 --> 20:47.892
<font color="#FFFF00">He said he'd rip out my tongue</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and lick my arse.</font>

20:47.893 --> 20:50.892
What? What the fuck?
<font color="#FFFF00">Is that what you said?</font>

20:50.893 --> 20:52.932
No, no.
I said he'd lick his own arse

20:52.933 --> 20:54.452
after I shoved his tongue up...

20:54.453 --> 20:56.252
I wasn't threatening to lick his...

20:56.253 --> 20:58.292
(INHALES)
Thanks for a lovely evening.

20:58.293 --> 20:59.693
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, no, you don't!</font>

21:01.213 --> 21:03.012
Aargh!

21:03.013 --> 21:05.372
<font color="#FFFF00">Right, so hang on.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Was it a date or not?</font>

21:05.373 --> 21:07.612
I don't know. Never found out.

21:07.613 --> 21:12.132
Either way, Lupercalia succeeded
in taking a shitload of cash off me.

21:12.133 --> 21:13.732
How was your night, then, Grumio?

21:13.733 --> 21:16.692
<font color="#FFFF00">There were a rocky patch earlier</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but I can win myself round.</font>

21:16.693 --> 21:19.452
Oh, lovely. At least one of us
might get some action tonight.

21:19.453 --> 21:21.252
<font color="#FFFF00">Hey!</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not giving up that easy.</font>

21:21.253 --> 21:23.572
<font color="#FFFF00">Lupercalia ain't over yet!</font>
(SCOFFS)

21:23.573 --> 21:26.292
Ah, here he is!
How was Tabitha, then?

21:26.293 --> 21:28.652
<font color="#FFFF00">Not quite what I hoped.</font>
See, I told you.

21:28.653 --> 21:30.532
The picture wasn't accurate, right?

21:30.533 --> 21:33.212
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, no, it was...</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about 40 years ago.</font>

21:33.213 --> 21:36.372
<font color="#FFFF00">You'll see her in a sec. She's</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">just struggling with the stairs.</font>

21:36.373 --> 21:38.412
<font color="#FFFF00">We had a bit of a row, actually.</font>

21:38.413 --> 21:39.692
Oh, dear, what happened?

21:39.693 --> 21:42.372
<font color="#FFFF00">It was over that bloody poem.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">She found it offensive.</font>

21:42.373 --> 21:44.852
I find that offensive.
That poem were quality.

21:44.853 --> 21:48.372
<font color="#FFFF00">I wouldn't worry about Tabitha.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I think her night's looking up.</font>

21:48.373 --> 21:50.812
Hey, Tabitha! How you doin', baby?

21:50.813 --> 21:52.813
Happy Lupercalia!
