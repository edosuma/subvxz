Mr. Frank.

09:26.817 --> 09:28.818
Mr. Frank?

09:33.950 --> 09:35.951
Kraler?

09:39.747 --> 09:42.165
[Mr. Frank]
Mr. Kraler.

09:42.250 --> 09:44.251
Miep.

09:47.088 --> 09:49.005
My good friends.

09:49.090 --> 09:51.007
Oh, it-

09:51.092 --> 09:54.344
it is so good
to see you home.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.429
We had heard nothing.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.685
I'm alone.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.688
You must
come home
with us...

10:04.772 --> 10:06.773
and rest now.

10:06.899 --> 10:11.403
You must stay with us.
No, Miep. I can't
stay in Amsterdam.

10:12.697 --> 10:16.491
Mr. Frank,
this is your home.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.493
Amsterdam
is your home.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.996
It has too many
memories for me.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.998
Everywhere there's
something, Miep.
Everywhere.

10:23.082 --> 10:25.834
Even seeing
you and Mr. Kraler.

10:28.879 --> 10:32.299
Forgive me. I shouldn't
talk to you like this
after all that you did.

10:32.383 --> 10:34.384
We would
do it again.

10:36.387 --> 10:39.264
Everything's gone-
the book.

10:39.348 --> 10:41.266
They took
everything...

10:41.350 --> 10:43.268
except some papers.

10:43.352 --> 10:45.854
We saved
your letters
and papers.

10:51.861 --> 10:54.237
Please burn them.

10:54.322 --> 10:56.239
Burn everything.

10:56.324 --> 10:59.242
I- I...

10:59.327 --> 11:03.455
told Anne
if I got back here,
I'd find her book.

11:03.539 --> 11:07.292
Anne's diary?
It's where she left it.

11:57.968 --> 12:01.971
"The ninth of July, 1942."

12:03.808 --> 12:06.643
1942.
Is it possible, Miep?

12:06.727 --> 12:09.521
Only three years ago.

12:09.605 --> 12:13.525
"Dear Diary,
since you and I are going
to be great friends,

is Jewish,

[Anne's Voice Only]
You could not do this,
and you could not do that.

12:41.512 --> 12:44.431
We had to wear
yellow stars.

12:44.515 --> 12:46.766
I had to turn in my bike.

12:46.851 --> 12:49.769
I couldn't go
to a Dutch school anymore.

12:49.854 --> 12:53.273
I couldn't go to the movies
or ride in an automobile,

12:53.357 --> 12:55.275
or even on a streetcar,

12:55.359 --> 12:58.111
and a million other things.

12:58.195 --> 13:02.782
But somehow we children
still managed to have fun.

13:02.867 --> 13:06.119
This morning Father
woke me at 5:00...

13:06.203 --> 13:09.622
and told me
to hurry and get dressed.

13:09.707 --> 13:12.292
We were going into hiding.

13:12.376 --> 13:15.628
I was to put on
as many clothes as I could.

13:15.713 --> 13:19.716
It would look too suspicious
if we walked along
carrying suitcases.

13:21.177 --> 13:23.720
We were going to disappear,

13:23.804 --> 13:26.473
vanish into thin air.

13:30.728 --> 13:33.730
I'm living
a great adventure.

13:41.238 --> 13:43.656
Three other people
were coming in with us.

13:43.741 --> 13:46.493
Father knew them,
but we had never met them.

13:46.577 --> 13:48.578
[Sighs]

13:58.464 --> 14:00.381
Something's
happened.

14:00.466 --> 14:02.342
They have three miles
to walk.

14:02.468 --> 14:04.886
Mother-
They've been
arrested. I know.

14:04.970 --> 14:07.514
Will you
stop that?
Mother! Father!

14:07.598 --> 14:09.891
We're here.

14:09.975 --> 14:11.976
See?

14:14.522 --> 14:16.439
Mr. Van Daan.
Hello, hello.

14:16.524 --> 14:19.609
Mrs. Van Daan. Peter.
[Chuckling]
Mr. Frank.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.612
There were too many
of the Green Police
on the streets.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.073
We had to take
the long way around.

14:25.199 --> 14:29.494
Did you introduce yourself?
My daughter Anne. My wife Edith.
Hello.

14:29.578 --> 14:31.496
Margot.
Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan.
Hello.

14:31.580 --> 14:34.499
Oh, and this is
our son Peter.

14:34.583 --> 14:39.420
So, now, please,
let us take off
some of these clothes.

14:39.505 --> 14:41.422
[Mr. Kraler]
Good morning.

14:41.507 --> 14:43.925
Hello, Mr. Kraler.
Good morning,
Mr. Kraler.

14:44.009 --> 14:46.594
Mr. Frank.
Ah, you're all here.
That is good.

14:46.679 --> 14:49.097
We had hoped to have
everything in order.

14:49.181 --> 14:51.599
Please, Mr. Kraler,
don't even think of it.

14:51.684 --> 14:54.561
After all, we'll have
plenty of leisure to arrange
everything ourselves.

14:54.687 --> 14:57.605
I brought some sandwiches
for your lunch.
Thank you, Miep.

14:57.690 --> 15:00.567
The canned goods are here,
and your stores
of dried beans and potatoes.

15:00.693 --> 15:04.112
I'll get you ration books
this afternoon.
Ration books?

15:04.196 --> 15:07.448
If they see our names
on ration books,
they'll know we're here.

15:07.533 --> 15:10.702
Don't worry.
It won't be your names
that'll be on them.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.167
Anne, no!

15:19.295 --> 15:21.713
You must never
touch a curtain.
Never.

15:21.797 --> 15:25.216
No one must ever
touch a curtain,
day or night.

15:25.301 --> 15:28.761
If someone on the streets
should look up, or someone
in those houses should see,

15:28.846 --> 15:30.680
we would be lost.

15:30.764 --> 15:33.683
Please remember,
it's not only our lives
that are at stake,

15:33.767 --> 15:35.643
but also Miep's
and Mr. Kraler's.

15:35.769 --> 15:38.605
You have but 13 minutes
to get settled.
Thank you.

15:38.689 --> 15:43.568
Miep or I will be up each day
to bring you food and news.
Come, Miep. We must go.

15:43.652 --> 15:45.653
Good-bye for now.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.990
How can we thank you?

15:50.576 --> 15:53.494
I never thought
I'd live to see the day...

15:53.579 --> 15:56.497
when a man like Mr. Frank
would have to go into hiding.

15:56.582 --> 15:58.750
When you think of the-

15:58.876 --> 16:00.793
Good-bye.
Thank you,
Mr. Kraler.

16:00.878 --> 16:02.879
Good-bye, Miep.
Good-bye.

16:07.593 --> 16:09.761
Good-bye.

16:16.060 --> 16:19.812
[Edith] Anne!
It's all right.
I have on three more.

16:19.897 --> 16:21.814
Excuse me,
Mr. Frank.

16:21.899 --> 16:24.484
What did he mean,
just 13 minutes?

16:24.568 --> 16:26.486
Before
the workmen come.

16:26.570 --> 16:29.489
Now, while the men are
in the building below,

16:29.573 --> 16:31.491
we must have
complete quiet.

16:31.575 --> 16:33.993
Every sound can be
heard down there,

16:34.078 --> 16:36.996
not only in the offices
but in the workrooms too.

16:37.081 --> 16:39.957
The men come at about 8:30,
they leave at about 5:30,

16:40.042 --> 16:43.461
so to be perfectly safe,
from 8:00 in the morning
until 6:00 in the evening...

16:43.545 --> 16:46.964
we must move about up here
only when it is
absolutely necessary,

16:47.049 --> 16:48.966
and then
in stocking feet.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.969
We must not speak
above a whisper.
We must not run any water.

16:52.054 --> 16:55.473
We cannot use the sink
or even- forgive me-
the W.C.

16:55.557 --> 16:57.934
The pipes go down
through the workrooms.

16:58.060 --> 17:01.062
No trash must ever be-

17:10.906 --> 17:13.407
[Wailing Passes,
Fades]

17:18.622 --> 17:22.541
No trash must ever be
thrown out which might reveal
that someone is living up here.

17:22.626 --> 17:24.544
Not even
a potato peeling.

17:24.627 --> 17:27.547
We must burn everything
in this stove at night.

17:27.631 --> 17:32.218
This is the way that we must
live until it is over,
if we are to survive.

17:32.302 --> 17:34.721
Until it is over.

17:34.805 --> 17:37.724
[Chuckles]
After 6:00
we can move about.

17:37.808 --> 17:41.018
We can talk and laugh,
have our supper,
read, play games,

17:41.103 --> 17:43.020
just as we would
at home.

17:43.105 --> 17:47.525
Now I think it would be wise
if we all went to our rooms
and were settled before 8:00.

17:47.609 --> 17:49.944
Mrs. Van Daan,
you and your husband
will be upstairs.

17:50.028 --> 17:52.947
I regret that
there's no place up there
for Peter,

17:53.031 --> 17:54.949
but he'll be here,
near us.

17:55.033 --> 17:58.953
- And where am I?
- You and Margot will be in there, Annele.

17:59.037 --> 18:01.414
[Mrs. Van Daan]
Excuse me, Mr. Frank.
Yes?

18:01.540 --> 18:05.585
Where do you
and Mrs. Frank sleep?
This room is also our bedroom.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.545
Oh, no.
You take the upstairs.

18:07.671 --> 18:10.590
It's not right.
It's your place.
We'll sleep down here.

18:10.674 --> 18:13.384
I've thought this out for weeks.
It's the best arrangement.
The only arrangement.

18:13.469 --> 18:15.386
Uh, Edith?

18:15.471 --> 18:17.388
Hmm?

18:17.473 --> 18:19.390
You must have
some rest, dear.

18:19.475 --> 18:21.350
You didn't
close your eyes
last night.

18:21.477 --> 18:24.145
Please go in
the girls' room with Margot.
How about Anne?

18:24.229 --> 18:28.149
I feel fine.
I'm going to help Father.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.401
This way,
Mrs. Van Daan.

18:33.572 --> 18:35.573
Excuse me.

18:37.743 --> 18:39.702
Up here.

Mr. Frank.

19:24.039 --> 19:26.541
- Mr. Frank?
- Peter?

19:26.625 --> 19:30.503
- Do I still have time
to get some water for my cat?
- Have you got a cat?

19:30.587 --> 19:33.422
Go ahead, but be quick.
You only have five minutes.

19:33.507 --> 19:35.758
He couldn't live
without that cat.

19:41.682 --> 19:44.100
I didn't know
you had a cat.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.102
I love cats.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.938
What's its name?
Mouschi.

19:49.022 --> 19:51.941
What is it? Mouschi.
A him or her?

19:52.025 --> 19:54.944
It's a tom, and it
doesn't like strangers.

19:55.028 --> 19:58.030
Well, I'll have to stop
being a stranger, won't I?
Is he fixed?

19:58.115 --> 20:00.032
No.

20:00.117 --> 20:03.536
Well, you ought to
have him fixed to
keep him from fighting.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.913
What a nice cat.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.917
Where do you
go to school?

20:10.002 --> 20:11.919
Jewish Secondary.

20:12.004 --> 20:13.921
That's where
Margot and I go.

20:14.006 --> 20:15.923
Yeah, I know.

20:16.008 --> 20:17.925
I've never
seen you around.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.927
I used to see you
sometimes.

20:20.012 --> 20:21.929
You did?

20:22.014 --> 20:24.932
But why didn't you
ever come over?

20:25.017 --> 20:27.894
Oh, I don't know.
I'm sort of a lone wolf.

20:27.978 --> 20:30.187
Can't be
a lone wolf here.

20:32.900 --> 20:36.986
Wonder what our friends
will say when
we don't show up today?

20:37.070 --> 20:38.905
I had a date
with Sanne.

20:38.989 --> 20:40.865
Do you know
Sanne de Vries?

20:40.991 --> 20:43.910
No.
Sanne's
my best friend.

20:43.994 --> 20:46.746
She's thin like me.

20:46.830 --> 20:50.541
They always yell at us,
"Anne and Sanne,
the skinny bananas."

20:52.628 --> 20:54.837
You took off
your star.

20:55.839 --> 20:57.757
That's right.

20:57.841 --> 21:01.677
You can't do that.
They'll arrest you if you
go out without your star.

21:01.762 --> 21:03.679
Who's going out?

21:03.764 --> 21:05.681
[Grunts]

21:05.766 --> 21:07.642
Help me.

21:07.768 --> 21:09.727
I'm helping.
[Groans]

21:11.480 --> 21:14.523
- What are you going to do with it?
- Burn it.

21:14.608 --> 21:17.610
That's funny.
I don't think I could burn mine.

21:17.694 --> 21:19.612
I don't know why.

21:19.696 --> 21:23.199
You couldn't?
Something they make you wear
so they can kick you around?

21:23.283 --> 21:25.201
I know.

21:25.285 --> 21:29.914
But, after all,
it is the Star of David, isn't it?

21:31.041 --> 21:33.376
Annele?
It's almost 8:00.

21:35.879 --> 21:39.256
Don't you want to come
and sit with us, Peter?
It's going to be a long day.

21:39.341 --> 21:41.384
No, thanks.
This is fine.

21:41.468 --> 21:44.470
You won't forget
to take off your shoes,
will you?

21:47.057 --> 21:49.475
Peter.

21:49.559 --> 21:52.061
It's nice
to have you with us.

21:53.355 --> 21:55.356
Yes, Mr. Frank.

21:57.526 --> 21:59.527
See you later.

22:01.196 --> 22:05.199
Do you know he went to
the same school that-

22:12.833 --> 22:16.419
[Bell Tolling 8:00]

22:41.111 --> 22:44.196
[Anne Narrating]
It's comforting to think that
Mr. Kraler and his secretary...

22:44.281 --> 22:47.366
are down there below us
in the office.

22:47.451 --> 22:49.368
Our protectors,
we call them.

22:49.453 --> 22:51.370
[Typing]

22:51.455 --> 22:54.874
I asked Father
what would happen to them
if anyone found out...

22:54.958 --> 22:56.876
they were hiding us.

22:56.960 --> 23:01.213
Father said they would suffer
the same fate that we would.

23:01.298 --> 23:03.549
[Machinery Droning]

23:03.633 --> 23:06.093
We are over
an old spice factory.

23:06.178 --> 23:09.513

39:57.396 --> 39:59.314
Anne, that's
a personal question.

39:59.398 --> 40:02.317
It's not courteous
to ask personal questions.

40:02.401 --> 40:04.319
I don't mind.

40:04.403 --> 40:07.572
Anneke, our house
was always swarming
with boys.

40:07.656 --> 40:11.284
- When I was a young girl-
- Oh, no. Not again.

40:11.368 --> 40:13.828
Shut up!

40:15.915 --> 40:19.250
[Mrs., Mr. Van Daan]
One summer we had a big house
in Hilversum.

40:19.335 --> 40:22.170
[Mr. Van Daan Continues]
The boys-

40:25.841 --> 40:30.095
The boys would come
buzzing around like bees
around a jam pot.

40:30.179 --> 40:32.097
When I was 17-

40:32.181 --> 40:35.100
Well, we were wearing
our skirts very short
in those days,

40:35.184 --> 40:37.435
and I had
such good-looking legs.

40:37.520 --> 40:42.023
I still have. I may not be
as pretty as I used to be,
but I still have my legs.

40:42.108 --> 40:44.025
How about it,
Mr. Frank?

40:44.110 --> 40:48.196
All right,
all right.
We see them.

40:48.280 --> 40:51.241
I'm not asking you.
I'm asking Mr. Frank.

40:51.325 --> 40:52.992
Mother,
for heaven's sakes.

40:53.077 --> 40:54.994
Oh, I embarrass you too,
do I?

40:55.079 --> 40:59.124
Well, I only hope
the girl you marry
has as good.

40:59.208 --> 41:03.711
Anneke, my father
used to worry about me with
all the boys hanging around.

41:03.796 --> 41:06.714
And he used to say to me,
"If any of those boys
get fresh,

41:06.799 --> 41:08.716
"you just say to him,

41:08.801 --> 41:12.762
'Remember, Mr. So-and-so,
remember, I am a lady."'

41:12.847 --> 41:15.223
Look at you,
talking that way
in front of her.

41:15.349 --> 41:18.518
Don't you know she puts it
all down in that damned diary?
So what if she does?

41:18.602 --> 41:20.728
I'm only telling
the truth.

41:22.815 --> 41:24.732
Haven't you
finished yet?

41:24.817 --> 41:26.985
No.

41:27.069 --> 41:28.778
Oh. The thinker.

41:28.863 --> 41:30.780
Leave him alone.

41:30.865 --> 41:33.825
All right, all right.
I'm a dunce, a hopeless case.

41:33.909 --> 41:35.827
[Mrs. Van Daan]
You're not hopeless.

41:35.911 --> 41:39.706
It's just that you haven't
got anyone to help you
like Father helps Anne and me.

41:39.790 --> 41:43.668
Well, if I-
Well, if we could help-

41:43.752 --> 41:46.171
What about it, Peter?
Would you like to study with us?

41:46.255 --> 41:49.007
Shall we make
our school coeducational?

41:49.091 --> 41:51.593
Thanks. Yes.

41:51.677 --> 41:55.263
Mr. Frank, you are an angel,
an absolute angel.

41:55.347 --> 41:58.683
Why didn't I meet you
before I met that one there?

42:00.686 --> 42:02.604
I... think
it might be better...

42:02.688 --> 42:05.106
if you went
into your room,
Peter, to work.

42:05.191 --> 42:07.108
Excuse me.

42:07.193 --> 42:11.571
You listen to Mr. Frank.
Mr. Frank is
a highly educated man.

42:14.450 --> 42:17.035
[Mr. Van Daan]
It's after 8:00.
Where are they?

42:17.161 --> 42:20.788
At least one of them
should have come.
They'll come. Don't worry.

42:20.873 --> 42:23.791
Don't tell me.
I know something's wrong.

42:23.876 --> 42:27.253
Isn't it bad enough around here
without you sprawling
all over the place?

42:27.338 --> 42:30.215
If you didn't smoke
all the time, you wouldn't
be so bad-tempered.

42:30.341 --> 42:33.760
Do you see me smoking?
Oh, you already smoked up
all the cigarettes?

42:33.844 --> 42:36.763
One package.
Miep only brought me
one package.

42:36.847 --> 42:39.641
It's a filthy habit,
and this is a good time
to break yourself of it.

42:39.725 --> 42:42.644
- Oh, stop it.
- You're smoking up
all our money!

42:42.728 --> 42:45.104
Will you shut up!

42:48.651 --> 42:50.652
And what are you
staring at?

42:51.946 --> 42:54.739
I never heard grown-ups
quarrel like that before.

42:54.823 --> 42:56.741
I thought
only children quarreled.

42:56.825 --> 42:59.786
This isn't a quarrel.
It's a discussion.

42:59.870 --> 43:03.122
- And I never heard children
so rude before.
- I, rude?

43:03.207 --> 43:05.124
Yes!
Anne,
drink your milk.

43:05.209 --> 43:09.087
The trouble with you is,
you've been spoiled.
You need a spanking.

43:09.171 --> 43:12.090
Remember, Mr. So-and-so,
that I am a lady.

43:12.174 --> 43:15.093
Mmm, you're
the most aggravating-

43:15.177 --> 43:18.096
Why aren't you nice and quiet
like your sister Margot?

43:18.180 --> 43:20.598
Why do you
have to show off
all the time?

43:20.683 --> 43:24.102
Let me give you
a little advice, young lady-
men don't like that in a girl.

43:24.186 --> 43:27.563
Do you know that?
A man likes a girl who will
listen to him once in a while.

43:27.690 --> 43:31.609
A domestic girl
who loves to cook and clean-
I'd cut my throat first!

43:31.694 --> 43:33.945
I'd open my veins.

43:34.029 --> 43:36.322
I'm going to be
remarkable.

43:36.448 --> 43:40.493
I'm going to Paris
to study music and art.
Paris? Yeah, yeah.

43:40.577 --> 43:44.747
I'm going to be an actress,
or a writer, or a dancer.

43:44.832 --> 43:46.833

I'm so sorry.

43:51.463 --> 43:54.382

I'm so sorry.

44:07.980 --> 44:10.898
Anne, you must not
behave in that way.

44:10.983 --> 44:14.193
It was an accident.
Anyone can have an accident.

44:14.278 --> 44:17.196
I don't mean that.
I mean the answering back.

44:17.281 --> 44:19.198

answer back.

walk all over me the way
they do her? No, thanks.

happens to you, Anne.

talked to my mother
as you talk to me-

like that anymore.

the difference?

56:37.562 --> 56:40.773
Usually, when I come up here,
I try to bring good news.
Yes, I know.

56:40.857 --> 56:43.358
Something has happened.
A man came to me.

56:43.443 --> 56:46.361
He told me that
he has a Jewish friend- a dentist.

56:46.446 --> 56:50.365
He begged me,
could I find him a hiding place?
So I have come to you.

56:50.450 --> 56:53.744
I know it is a terrible thing to ask,
living the way you are,

56:53.828 --> 56:56.830
but could you take him in?

56:56.915 --> 57:00.084
Well, of course
we will.
His name is Jan Dussel.

57:00.168 --> 57:04.588
Dussel. Wait a minute.
I think I know him.
It's fine to have him.

57:04.672 --> 57:07.424
But, Otto, where are
we going to put him? Where?

57:07.509 --> 57:09.718
There's so little food as it is,
and to take in another person-

57:09.803 --> 57:11.720
We can stretch the food
a little, Mr. Van Daan.

57:11.846 --> 57:14.431
He can have my bed.
No, thank you, Peter.

57:14.516 --> 57:16.975
Margot will move
in here with us,
and he can have her bed.

57:17.060 --> 57:20.395
- I'll get my things out.
- [Footsteps Descending]

57:47.382 --> 57:50.384
[Bell Tolling]

57:59.561 --> 58:01.520
Mr. Dussel.

58:10.738 --> 58:13.407
[Tolling Continues]
Don't bump your head.

58:16.703 --> 58:20.330
Come in, Mr. Dussel.

58:20.415 --> 58:24.084
This is Mr. Frank.
Mr. Otto Frank?

58:24.169 --> 58:26.837
Yes. Let me have
your things, please.

58:26.921 --> 58:30.507
Thank you, Mr. Frank.
I leave you in good hands.

58:30.592 --> 58:32.342
Mr. Dussel?
Hmm?

58:32.427 --> 58:35.095
I must return
your coat.

58:36.973 --> 58:39.266
What can I say to thank you?

58:39.350 --> 58:43.228
Mr. Kraler and Miep,
they're our lifeline.
Without them, we couldn't live.

58:43.313 --> 58:46.106
Please, you make us
seem very heroic.
It isn't that at all.

58:46.232 --> 58:51.111
We simply don't like the Nazis.
We don't like their methods-
I know. I know.

58:51.196 --> 58:53.864
"Nobody's gonna tell
us Dutchmen what to do
with our damn Jews."

58:53.948 --> 58:57.993
[Chuckles] We will be
up tomorrow to see that
they are treating you right.

58:58.119 --> 59:01.955
Good-bye.
[Mr. Frank] Good-bye, Mr. Kraler.
Good-bye, Miep.

59:02.081 --> 59:05.209
Welcome, Mr. Dussel.
Thank you.

59:05.293 --> 59:08.921
This is my wife, Edith.
Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan.

59:09.005 --> 59:13.467
Their son, Peter,
my daughters Margot and Anne.

59:13.593 --> 59:15.928
Anne.
How do you do.

59:16.054 --> 59:20.807
Margot.
Please, Mr. Dussel,
sit down.

59:21.809 --> 59:24.519
Thank you.

59:24.604 --> 59:27.272
I'm dreaming,
I know it.

59:27.357 --> 59:30.651
Mr. Otto Frank, here.

59:30.735 --> 59:35.322
You're not in Switzerland, then?
Someone said that
you escaped to Switzerland.

59:37.283 --> 59:40.953
And you've been here
all this time?
Ever since July.

59:43.289 --> 59:47.251
Did Mr. Kraler warn you
you won't get much to eat here?

59:47.335 --> 59:52.506
You can imagine...
three ration cards
among the seven of us.

59:52.590 --> 59:55.926
Now you make eight.

59:56.010 --> 59:59.471
Mr. Van Daan, you don't realize
what's happening outside...

59:59.555 --> 01:00:02.224
that you should warn me
of a thing like that.

01:00:03.685 --> 01:00:08.355
You don't realize what's going on
right here in Amsterdam.

01:00:08.439 --> 01:00:10.649
Every day, hundreds
of Jews disappear.

01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:17.656
They surround a block,
and they search
house by house.

01:00:19.409 --> 01:00:24.079
Every day children
come home from school
to find their parents gone.

01:00:25.415 --> 01:00:27.416
Hundreds are being deported.

01:00:30.003 --> 01:00:33.672
People that you and I know-
the Hallensteins, the Wessels.

01:00:33.756 --> 01:00:35.674
[Mrs. Van Daan]
Oh, no.

01:00:35.758 --> 01:00:38.802
You get your
call-up notice-

01:00:38.886 --> 01:00:42.848
come to the station
on such and such a day and hour.

01:00:42.932 --> 01:00:45.600
Bring only what
you can carry.

01:00:45.685 --> 01:00:49.104
If you don't go, they come
and drag you from your home...

01:00:49.188 --> 01:00:52.107
and ship you off to Mauthausen-
the death camp.

01:00:52.191 --> 01:00:54.609
We didn't know
that things had got
so much worse.

01:00:54.694 --> 01:00:58.155
Forgive me
for speaking so.

01:00:58.239 --> 01:01:01.450
Do you know the de Vries?

01:01:01.534 --> 01:01:03.535
They're gone.

01:01:09.417 --> 01:01:12.753
Sanne and I
are in the same class.

01:01:12.837 --> 01:01:16.631
Sanne is my best-
my best friend.

01:01:16.716 --> 01:01:20.886
She returned home from school
to find her parents gone.

01:01:23.139 --> 01:01:27.476
She was alone for two days,
and then they came
and took her away.

01:01:30.146 --> 01:01:32.147
Gone?

01:01:38.821 --> 01:01:41.156
With all the others.

01:01:42.784 --> 01:01:45.285
Oh, no.

01:01:51.459 --> 01:01:54.419
Some people named Meyerberg,
they lived near us-

01:01:54.504 --> 01:01:57.047
I think we should
put this off until later,
Mrs. Van Daan.

01:01:57.131 --> 01:01:59.299
I'm sure Mr. Dussel would
like to get settled now.

01:01:59.384 --> 01:02:02.386
Annele, would you like to
take Mr. Dussel to his room?

01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:05.138
If youâ€™ll come with me,
Mr. Dussel.

01:02:07.725 --> 01:02:12.396
Uh, forgive me
if I haven't expressed
my gratitude.

01:02:13.648 --> 01:02:17.651
This has been
such a shock to me.

01:02:17.735 --> 01:02:20.654
I always thought of
myself as Dutch.

01:02:20.738 --> 01:02:23.323
I was born in Holland.

01:02:23.408 --> 01:02:27.411
My father was born
in Holland,
and my grandfather.

01:02:27.495 --> 01:02:31.832
And now after
all these years-

01:02:34.335 --> 01:02:36.837
If you will excuse me.

01:02:40.174 --> 01:02:44.344

â™ªâ™ª [Continues]

01:03:15.501 --> 01:03:18.962
It's so different
from what Mr. Kraler
tells us.

01:03:19.046 --> 01:03:21.673
Mr. Kraler says that
things are improving.

01:03:21.757 --> 01:03:25.677
I like it better
the way Kraler tells it.

01:03:25.761 --> 01:03:28.763

Good night, Bubele.

01:04:21.901 --> 01:04:25.403
Say good night.
Good night, Mother.

01:04:30.493 --> 01:04:32.202
[Mrs. Van Daan]
Good night, Mr. Frank.
Good night.

01:04:32.286 --> 01:04:34.788
Good night.

01:04:36.958 --> 01:04:39.960
Do you have any children,
Mr. Dussel?

01:04:40.044 --> 01:04:43.046
No, I never married.

01:04:46.801 --> 01:04:50.136
Have you no family
at all?
No one.

01:04:54.684 --> 01:04:59.980
How dreadful.
You must be terribly lonely.

01:05:00.064 --> 01:05:03.692
Mm. I'm used to it.

01:05:03.818 --> 01:05:07.487
I don't think I could
ever get used to it.
[Clears Throat]

01:05:09.323 --> 01:05:12.576
Didn't you even have
a pet? A cat or a dog?
No.

01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:17.622
No, no. I have an allergy
to fur-bearing animals.

01:05:17.707 --> 01:05:21.585
Gives me asthma.
Oh, dear.

01:05:21.711 --> 01:05:24.504
What?
Peter has a cat.

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:29.384
He has?
He has it here?
Yes.

01:05:29.468 --> 01:05:31.469

01:05:50.239 --> 01:05:54.159
We hardly ever see it.
He keeps it in his room
all the time.

01:05:54.243 --> 01:05:56.578
I'm sure it will
be all right.

01:05:56.662 --> 01:05:58.663
Mm-hmm.
Well, I hope so.

01:06:03.919 --> 01:06:06.963
I hope I'm not going to be
too much of a bother
to you, Mr. Dussel.

01:06:07.048 --> 01:06:08.965
No.

01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:12.552
I seem to be able to
get everyone's back up.

01:06:12.637 --> 01:06:16.640
Oh, I always get along
very well with young people.

01:06:16.724 --> 01:06:19.309
My patients all bring
their children to me...

01:06:19.393 --> 01:06:22.479
because they know
I get along well with them.

01:06:22.563 --> 01:06:24.564
So don't you worry
about that.

01:06:26.025 --> 01:06:28.818
Thank you,
Mr. Dussel.

01:06:28.903 --> 01:06:32.697
Good night.
I'll be back.

01:06:32.782 --> 01:06:36.451

Hush, darling.

01:09:29.917 --> 01:09:32.335
Hush. It's all right.
It's all right.

01:09:32.419 --> 01:09:35.964
Please, Mr. Dussel,
turn on the light.
It was just a dream.

01:09:36.048 --> 01:09:38.925
You're here, safe.
You see?

01:09:39.009 --> 01:09:43.011
Something must be done
with that child,
yelling like that.

01:09:43.096 --> 01:09:47.140
Who knows who might be in the street.
She's endangering all our lives.

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:51.688
Mr. Dussel, after all,
Anne is not exactly
a trained, frontline soldier.

01:09:51.772 --> 01:09:54.691
Please, Mr. Dussel,
go back to bed.

01:09:54.775 --> 01:09:58.194
She'll be herself
in a minute or two.
Won't you, Anne?

01:10:00.322 --> 01:10:03.491
Go back to bed.
[Scoffs]

01:10:05.244 --> 01:10:10.665
Excuse me. I'm going to the W.C.,
the one room where there's peace.

01:10:10.749 --> 01:10:13.042
[Mr. Frank]
Go back to bed now.

01:10:13.127 --> 01:10:17.797

some water?

01:10:17.882 --> 01:10:21.467
Was it a very bad dream?

01:10:21.552 --> 01:10:23.636
Perhaps if you
told me.

01:10:23.762 --> 01:10:27.974
I'd rather not talk about it.
Try to sleep then.

01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:33.980
I'll sit right here
beside you.
You don't have to.

01:10:35.524 --> 01:10:39.694
But I'd like to stay
with you very much. Really.

01:10:39.778 --> 01:10:42.196
I'd rather you didn't.

01:10:47.578 --> 01:10:51.748
Good night-

01:10:56.420 --> 01:11:00.757
You'll be all right?
There's nothing
that you want?

01:11:00.841 --> 01:11:05.011
Will you please
ask Father to come?

01:11:10.684 --> 01:11:13.686
Yes, of course,
Anne dear.

01:11:21.403 --> 01:11:24.405
She asks for you.

01:11:25.449 --> 01:11:28.326
Edith.
Go to her, Otto.

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:31.079
She's still trembling with fear.

01:11:49.723 --> 01:11:54.185
[Sobbing]
She wants nothing of me.

01:11:54.269 --> 01:11:56.604
She pulled away when
I leaned down to kiss her.

01:11:56.689 --> 01:11:59.190
The Green Police
broke down a door
and grabbed me...

01:11:59.274 --> 01:12:01.693
and tried to drag me out
the way they did Sanne.

01:12:01.777 --> 01:12:04.612
[Margot]
It's just a phase.

01:12:04.697 --> 01:12:07.615
All girls turn to their
fathers at this age.

01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:10.034
They give all their love
to their fathers.

01:12:10.119 --> 01:12:14.247
You weren't like this.
You didn't shut me out.

01:12:16.542 --> 01:12:18.459
So...

01:12:20.129 --> 01:12:22.463
now, do you want me to
read to you for a while?

01:12:22.548 --> 01:12:25.842
No. Just sit with me
for a minute.

01:12:25.926 --> 01:12:29.220
Was I awful?
Do you think anyone outside
could've heard me?

01:12:29.304 --> 01:12:34.183
No. Now lie down quietly.
So, like this.

01:12:34.268 --> 01:12:36.853
Now try to sleep.

01:12:36.937 --> 01:12:42.608
I'm a terrible coward.
I'm so disappointed in myself.

01:12:42.693 --> 01:12:45.028
[Sighs]

01:12:45.112 --> 01:12:47.447
I think I'm really grown up,

01:12:47.531 --> 01:12:51.325
and then something happens
and I run to you like a baby.

01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:54.203
I love you, Father.
I don't love anyone but you.

01:12:54.288 --> 01:12:56.664
Annele. Annele.

01:12:56.749 --> 01:13:00.376
It's true.
You're the only one I love.

01:13:00.461 --> 01:13:04.464
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

01:13:04.548 --> 01:13:09.260
It's fine- It's fine to have you
tell me that you love me,

01:13:09.344 --> 01:13:13.556
but I'd be much happier
if you said that you
loved your mother as well.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:16.809
She needs your help so much.

01:13:18.103 --> 01:13:20.980
Your love.
We have nothing in common.

01:13:21.065 --> 01:13:23.483
She doesn't understand me.

01:13:23.567 --> 01:13:27.320
Whenever I try to
explain my views on life,
she asks me if I'm constipated.

01:13:28.655 --> 01:13:33.326
You hurt her very much just now.
She's crying. She's in there crying.

01:13:42.211 --> 01:13:47.423
Oh, Father,
I was horrible, wasn't I?

01:13:47.508 --> 01:13:50.468
What's the matter with me?
Tell me.

01:13:50.552 --> 01:13:53.513
Don't say it's just a phase.
Help me.

01:13:55.974 --> 01:14:00.770
There's so little we parents can do
to help our children, Anne.

01:14:00.854 --> 01:14:05.358
We can only try to
set a good example.
Point the way.

01:14:05.442 --> 01:14:07.985
The rest you must do yourself.

01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:12.615
I'm trying. Really, I am.

01:14:12.699 --> 01:14:17.870
Every night I think back
over all the things I did that day
that were wrong.

01:14:17.955 --> 01:14:20.873
Like putting the wet mop
in Mrs. Van Daan's bed.

01:14:20.999 --> 01:14:25.128
[Giggles]
[Chuckling]

01:14:25.212 --> 01:14:27.839
And now this with Mother.

01:14:27.923 --> 01:14:30.925
I say to myself,
"That was wrong."

01:14:31.009 --> 01:14:34.595
And I make up my mind I'm never
going to do that again. Never.

01:14:36.265 --> 01:14:39.142
I may do something worse,
but I'll never do that again.

01:14:39.226 --> 01:14:43.563
[Sighs]
I have a nicer side, Father.

01:14:43.647 --> 01:14:46.357
But I'm scared to show it.

01:14:46.441 --> 01:14:49.777
I'm afraid people
will laugh at me.

01:14:51.321 --> 01:14:55.491
So the mean Anne
comes to the outside...

01:14:55.576 --> 01:14:58.578
and the good Anne
stays in the inside.

01:15:00.164 --> 01:15:04.000
And I keep on trying to
switch them around...

01:15:04.084 --> 01:15:09.088
and have the good Anne outside
and the bad Anne inside.

01:15:11.508 --> 01:15:13.843
It would be what I'd like to be...

01:15:15.345 --> 01:15:19.599
and might be... if only-

01:15:20.809 --> 01:15:22.810
[Sighs]

01:15:41.705 --> 01:15:43.706
She's asleep.

01:16:51.024 --> 01:16:56.445
[Anne Narrating]
Thursday, the 29th
of October, 1942.

01:16:56.530 --> 01:16:59.573
Mr. Dussel and I
had a great battle yesterday.

01:16:59.658 --> 01:17:03.202
Yes, Mr. Dussel.

01:17:03.287 --> 01:17:07.456
According to him, nothing,
I repeat, nothing is right about me.

01:17:09.293 --> 01:17:12.503
While he was going on at me,
I thought,

01:17:12.587 --> 01:17:16.132
"Someday, I'm going to
give you such a smack...

01:17:16.216 --> 01:17:19.218
that you'll fly
right up to the ceiling."

01:17:21.054 --> 01:17:25.891
Why is it that every
grown-up thinks he knows
the way to bring up children?

01:17:32.566 --> 01:17:36.068
Particularly the grown-ups
that haven't any.

01:17:38.238 --> 01:17:41.741
Monday, the ninth of
November, 1942.

01:17:41.825 --> 01:17:46.203
Wonderful news.
The Allies have landed in Africa.

01:17:46.288 --> 01:17:48.956
Churchill spoke
on the BBC from London.

01:17:49.041 --> 01:17:52.918
[Radio: Churchill]
Which they have so often
meted out to others.

01:17:53.003 --> 01:17:56.172
Ah, this is not the end.

01:17:56.256 --> 01:18:00.676
No, it is not even
the beginning of the end.

01:18:00.761 --> 01:18:04.430
But it is, perhaps,
the end of the beginning.

01:18:04.514 --> 01:18:06.849
[Anne Narrating]
The air raids are getting worse.

01:18:06.933 --> 01:18:10.311
The British planes
come over day and night
on their way to Germany.

01:18:11.438 --> 01:18:13.981

[Gunfire Continues]

01:18:56.274 --> 01:18:58.901
Suppose they hit
this house?
What will we do?

01:18:58.985 --> 01:19:02.655
We can't go out
in the street.
What will we do?

01:19:02.739 --> 01:19:06.617
If they hit this house,
your worries will be over.

01:19:11.289 --> 01:19:14.417
That noise- that big explosion-
they hit one of the English planes.

01:19:14.501 --> 01:19:16.293
It fell right in this block.
Peter!

01:19:32.519 --> 01:19:35.438
[Mr. Frank]
It's far away from here.
Don't be nervous.

01:19:35.522 --> 01:19:38.941
Look. Just look at them.
Why, Mrs. Van Daan,
this should be music to your ears.

01:19:39.067 --> 01:19:40.985
Music?
Of course.

01:19:41.069 --> 01:19:43.279
The more planes
the British send over,

01:19:43.363 --> 01:19:46.365
the sooner the war will be over,
the sooner we'll be out of here
and home again.

01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:48.576
I don't believe
it'll ever be over.

01:19:50.287 --> 01:19:53.372
You know what I'd like right now?
A cup of tea.

01:19:53.457 --> 01:19:55.583
Oh, yes, please.

01:19:55.667 --> 01:19:57.751
You can't have tea
then for breakfast.

01:19:57.878 --> 01:20:00.796
If you have tea now,
you won't have any tomorrow.
I don't care.

01:20:00.881 --> 01:20:04.592
- Neither do I. Now, please.
- Me, too, please.

01:20:04.676 --> 01:20:07.678
How about you, Mr. Dussel?
Would you like your tea now
or tomorrow morning?

01:20:07.804 --> 01:20:10.973
Tomorrow morning.
Sure?

01:20:11.057 --> 01:20:13.893
- Sure.
- [Screams]

01:20:17.772 --> 01:20:20.065
I'll take mine now.

01:20:20.150 --> 01:20:22.651

[Anne Narrating]
Monday, the seventh
of December, 1942.

01:22:01.585 --> 01:22:04.753
The Hanukkah holiday
came early this year.

01:22:04.838 --> 01:22:08.924
"We kindle this Hanukkah light
to celebrate the great
and wonderful deeds...

01:22:09.009 --> 01:22:11.635
"wrought through the zeal
with which God filled the hearts...

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:15.097

indifference, against
tyranny and oppression...

"and they restored
our temple to us.

"May these lights remind us
that we should ever look to God,

"whence cometh our help.

Amen.

"I lift up mine eyes
unto the mountains from
whence cometh my help.

"My help cometh from

May I have the hats, please?
Thank you.

That was very moving.

Sit down.

01:23:22.582 --> 01:23:26.251
Where are you going?
There's lots more.
Songs and presents.

01:23:26.336 --> 01:23:28.754
Presents?
Not this year,
unfortunately.

01:23:28.838 --> 01:23:31.965
But always on Hanukkah
everyone gives presents.
Everyone.

01:23:32.092 --> 01:23:34.343
That's right.
Like our
Saint Nicholas day.

01:23:34.469 --> 01:23:37.471
Saint Nicholas day.
No, not like
Saint Nicholas day.

01:23:37.555 --> 01:23:40.057
What kind of a Jew are you
that you don't know Hanukkah?

01:23:40.141 --> 01:23:43.811
I remember particularly
the candles.
First one, as we have tonight.

01:23:43.895 --> 01:23:46.480
Then the second night,
you light two candles.
The next night, three.

01:23:46.564 --> 01:23:49.358
And so on, until there
are eight candles burning.

01:23:49.442 --> 01:23:53.445
When there are
eight candles,
it's truly beautiful.

01:23:53.530 --> 01:23:56.156
What I remember best
are the presents
we used to get.

01:23:56.241 --> 01:23:59.868
Eight days of presents,
and, well, each day
they got better and better.

01:23:59.953 --> 01:24:03.414
We're all here... alive.
That's present enough.

01:24:03.498 --> 01:24:08.085
- No, it isn't. I've got something.
- What is it?

01:24:08.211 --> 01:24:10.212
L'Chaim.
L'Chaim.

01:24:12.048 --> 01:24:14.675
Presents.
Real presents?

01:24:14.801 --> 01:24:16.719
She made it
herself.
Look at that.

01:24:16.803 --> 01:24:20.305
Isn't it festive?
Isn't it gay?
Oh, that's beautiful.

01:24:20.432 --> 01:24:23.434
For Margot.
Ah.

01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:32.276
Read it out loud.

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:35.028
[Clears Throat]
"You have never
lost your temper.

put all your cross words here."

01:24:42.454 --> 01:24:44.371
Aww.

01:24:44.456 --> 01:24:45.998
Let's see what it is.

01:24:46.082 --> 01:24:49.418
It's a new
crossword puzzle book.

01:24:49.502 --> 01:24:51.587
It's one you've done,
but I rubbed it all out...

01:24:51.671 --> 01:24:53.964
and if you wait a little
and forget,
you can do it again.

01:24:54.048 --> 01:24:56.049
[All Laughing]

01:24:56.134 --> 01:24:59.636

Thank you.

01:25:01.848 --> 01:25:05.017
For Mrs. Van Daan.
Ah-hah.

01:25:05.101 --> 01:25:08.437
I feel terrible.
I don't have a thing
for anybody.

01:25:12.025 --> 01:25:13.942
It's hair shampoo.

01:25:14.027 --> 01:25:17.905
I took odds and ends of soap
and mixed them with the last
of my toilet water.

01:25:18.031 --> 01:25:20.449
Oh, thank you,
Anneke.
That was nice.

01:25:20.533 --> 01:25:23.702
I wanted to write a poem
for all of them,
but I didn't have time.

01:25:23.787 --> 01:25:25.662
That's all right,
Anne.

01:25:25.789 --> 01:25:27.873
Yours, Mr. Van Daan,
is really something.
Mmm?

01:25:27.957 --> 01:25:31.960
Something you want
more than anything.
Hmm.

01:25:38.343 --> 01:25:42.387
- Cigarettes!
- Look at that.

01:25:42.472 --> 01:25:44.389
Cigarettes.
Two of them.

01:25:44.474 --> 01:25:47.142
Father found some old pipe tobacco
in the pocket lining of his coat,

01:25:47.227 --> 01:25:50.896
and we made them-
rather, Father did.

01:25:52.524 --> 01:25:55.150
[Mrs. Van Daan]
Look at that.

01:25:55.235 --> 01:25:58.237
Light it!
Go on and light it!

01:25:59.447 --> 01:26:02.991
It's tobacco.
Really, it is.

01:26:03.076 --> 01:26:06.078
There's a little fluff in it,
but not much.

01:26:13.419 --> 01:26:18.507
It works!
[Laughing]
Look at him.

01:26:18.591 --> 01:26:20.592
Thank you, Anne.
Thank you.

01:26:24.097 --> 01:26:26.306
[Laughing]
Mr. Van Daan!

For Mother.
Hanukkah greeting.

that I promise to pay.

01:26:51.624 --> 01:26:56.253
- Ten hours of doing what you're told?
Anything you're told?
- That's right.

01:26:59.465 --> 01:27:02.426
You wouldn't want to
sell that, Mrs. Frank,
would you?

01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:06.305
Never. This is the most
precious gift I've ever had.

01:27:08.641 --> 01:27:14.062
For Father.
Annele, I wasn't supposed to
have a present.

01:27:14.147 --> 01:27:16.189
Look at that.
It's a muffler.

01:27:16.274 --> 01:27:19.610
Oh, I know.
To wear around your neck
like an ascot, you know.

01:27:21.946 --> 01:27:26.909
I knitted it in the dark each night.
I'm afraid it looks better in the dark.

01:27:26.993 --> 01:27:29.494
It's fine.
Thank you, Annele.
Thank you.

Lovely, huh?
Thank you, Anne.

Go on. Open it.

Aren't you
going to open it?

Come on. Show us what it is.
It's a safety razor.

01:28:03.363 --> 01:28:07.699
It's not new.
Miep got it for me second-hand.
But you do need a razor now.

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:14.289
What for?
Look at his upper lip.
See?

01:28:14.374 --> 01:28:16.458
He wants to
get rid of that?

01:28:16.542 --> 01:28:21.546
Put some milk on it
and let the cat lick it off.
[Chuckles]

01:28:21.631 --> 01:28:23.674
You think you're funny,
don't you?

01:28:23.758 --> 01:28:27.219
Look, he can't wait.
He's going in to try it now.

01:28:27.345 --> 01:28:30.263
I'm going to give
Mouschi his present.
[Coughs]

01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:33.392
Mouschi, Mouschi, Mouschi.
Enough.

01:28:33.476 --> 01:28:37.813
And last, but never least,
my roommate, Mr. Dussel.

01:28:37.897 --> 01:28:40.232
Something for me?

01:28:46.948 --> 01:28:50.450
Capsules.
They're earplugs to
put in your ears...

01:28:50.535 --> 01:28:53.245
so you won't hear me
when I thrash around
at night.

01:28:53.329 --> 01:28:56.999
I made them myself.
Try them. See if
you can hear me.

01:29:01.587 --> 01:29:04.131
Wait, I'll put- Like that?
Is that what you mean?

01:29:04.257 --> 01:29:06.299
Are you ready?
What?

01:29:06.384 --> 01:29:11.596
- Are you ready?
- They work.

01:29:17.562 --> 01:29:20.814
They went in.
They went in.
[All Chuckling]

01:29:20.898 --> 01:29:23.650
He can't get 'em out.
What's the matter with you?
Get 'em out.

01:29:23.735 --> 01:29:25.861
Take 'em out.

01:29:25.945 --> 01:29:27.946
I got 'em.

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:33.952
- Thank you.
- [Chattering]

01:29:34.037 --> 01:29:36.705
And now let's sing
the song, Father.

01:29:36.789 --> 01:29:39.541
Wait till you hear
the Hanukkah song,
Mr. Dussel.

01:29:39.667 --> 01:29:42.586
â™ª O Hanukkah, O Hanukkah
The sweet celebration â™ª
Annele.

01:29:42.670 --> 01:29:45.005
Annele, we shouldn't
sing the song tonight.

01:29:45.089 --> 01:29:48.383
You see, Mr. Dussel,
it's a song of jubilation
and of rejoicing.

01:29:48.468 --> 01:29:50.969
One is apt to become
just a little too enthusiastic
about it.

01:29:51.054 --> 01:29:53.597
Please, let's
sing the song, Father.
I promise not to shout.

01:29:53.723 --> 01:29:56.975
Very well, but quietly, Anne.
I'll keep my eye on you-
[Coughing] Oh!

01:29:57.060 --> 01:30:01.563
Oh! I told you
not to come in here
with that cat.

01:30:01.647 --> 01:30:05.400
Get out of here.
[Coughing, Wheezing]

01:30:05.485 --> 01:30:08.612
What's the matter
with you?
Haven't you any sense?

01:30:08.696 --> 01:30:11.239
Get that cat
out of here.
Cat?

01:30:11.365 --> 01:30:15.202
You heard me.
Get it out of here!
[Coughing]

01:30:16.579 --> 01:30:19.331
I have no cat.
[Laughing]

01:30:19.415 --> 01:30:21.833
Mr. Dussel!

01:30:21.918 --> 01:30:24.669
It doesn't have to
be the cat.

01:30:24.754 --> 01:30:28.381
Just the hairs on his clothing
from the cat is enough.

01:30:28.508 --> 01:30:31.718
When he comes in the room-
Don't worry, you won't be
bothered anymore.

01:30:31.844 --> 01:30:34.930
We're getting rid
of it.
At last, you listen to me.

01:30:35.014 --> 01:30:38.642
I'm not doing it for you.
That's all in your mind.
All of it.

01:30:38.726 --> 01:30:43.021
I'm doing it because
I'm sick of seeing that cat
eat all our food.

01:30:43.106 --> 01:30:45.023
That's not true.
I only give him scraps.

01:30:45.108 --> 01:30:49.611
Don't tell me.
He gets fatter every day.

01:30:49.695 --> 01:30:52.739
Damn cat looks better than any of us.
Out he goes tonight.

01:30:52.865 --> 01:30:55.992
No!
Mr. Van Daan,
you can't do that.

01:30:56.119 --> 01:30:59.955
That's Peter's cat.
Peter loves that cat.
Anne.

01:31:01.374 --> 01:31:05.252
- If he goes, I go.
- Go. Go.

01:31:05.336 --> 01:31:07.963
He's not going,
and the cat's not going.
What's the matter with you?

01:31:08.047 --> 01:31:13.051
It's Hanukkah.
It's Hanukkah.
Please, Anne, sing.

01:31:18.975 --> 01:31:21.017
I think we should first
blow out the candles.

01:31:21.102 --> 01:31:23.019
Then we'll have something
for tomorrow night.

01:31:23.104 --> 01:31:27.107
Father, you're supposed to
let it burn itself out.

01:31:27.191 --> 01:31:30.110
I'm sure that God
understands shortages.

01:31:30.194 --> 01:31:32.112
Praise be Thou,
O Lord our God,
who has sustained us...

01:31:32.196 --> 01:31:34.447
and permitted us
to celebrate
this joyous festival.

01:31:34.574 --> 01:31:36.533

[Sighs]

01:35:16.003 --> 01:35:19.672
I think
they've gone.
They found us.

01:35:19.757 --> 01:35:21.925
If they had,
they would be
up here by now.

01:35:22.009 --> 01:35:26.513
I know it was
the Green Police.
They've gone to get help.

01:35:26.597 --> 01:35:28.807
It may be the Gestapo,
looking for papers.

01:35:28.891 --> 01:35:32.977
- Or another thief
looking for money.
- [Creaking]

01:35:39.276 --> 01:35:41.861
I'm going down.

01:35:41.987 --> 01:35:45.448
They may still be there.
Annele,
this is Saturday.

01:35:45.533 --> 01:35:49.911
We have no way of knowing
what has happened down there
until Miep and Mr. Kraler come.

01:35:49.995 --> 01:35:53.998
We cannot live
with this uncertainty.
Now, please. Please.

01:36:15.938 --> 01:36:19.357
Get our money.
They say you can buy them off.
So much a head.

01:36:19.442 --> 01:36:21.901
- Quick, go upstairs and get the money.
- Keep still.

01:36:21.986 --> 01:36:25.321
You wanna be dragged off
to a concentration camp?

01:36:25.406 --> 01:36:27.449
You gonna stand there
until they come up here and get you?

01:36:27.533 --> 01:36:29.534
Will you keep still!

01:36:47.344 --> 01:36:49.929
Someone go
and make Father come back.

01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:03.443
Haven't you
done enough?
Please, Mr. Van Daan.

01:37:09.033 --> 01:37:11.117
Anne!
Shh.

01:37:30.054 --> 01:37:35.016
I lift up mine eyes
unto the mountains
from whence cometh my help.

01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:38.436
My help cometh from the Lord
who made heaven and Earth.

01:38:17.101 --> 01:38:20.061
He that keepeth thee
will not slumber.

01:38:20.145 --> 01:38:24.399

doth neither slumber nor sleep.

and look and make sure.

shall keep thee from all evil.

He took the typewriter
and ran away in such a hurry,

01:39:49.568 --> 01:39:52.111
he didn't stop to
shut the street door-
it was swinging wide open.

01:39:52.196 --> 01:39:54.572
A watchman was passing.

Thank God they've gone.

01:45:28.657 --> 01:45:32.660
I'd just as soon they'd
take us than to continue
with this terrible agony.

01:45:32.744 --> 01:45:35.538
I can't stand it.
It's all right, Annele.

01:45:35.664 --> 01:45:39.458
The danger has passed.
Who says
the danger is passed?

01:45:39.543 --> 01:45:42.503
Don't you realize that
we're in greater danger
than ever?

01:45:42.587 --> 01:45:44.755
Please, Mr. Dussel,
will you keep still.

01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:48.843
Thanks to this clumsy fool,
someone now knows
we're up here.

01:45:48.927 --> 01:45:52.054
- Someone now knows
that we're up here hiding.
- It's a thief.

01:45:52.139 --> 01:45:54.056
You think the thief is going to
go to the Green Police and say,

01:45:54.141 --> 01:45:57.184
"I was robbing a place the other night,
and I heard a noise above my head"?

01:45:57.310 --> 01:45:59.562
You think a thief
is going to do that?
Yes, he will.

01:45:59.688 --> 01:46:03.858
You're crazy.
I think that someday
the thief will be caught.

01:46:03.942 --> 01:46:06.777
He'll make a bargain
with the Gestapo.

01:46:06.862 --> 01:46:09.572
He'll say to the Gestapo,
"If you let me off,

01:46:09.656 --> 01:46:11.741
I'll show you where
some Jews are hiding."

01:46:11.867 --> 01:46:13.993
That's what I think.
Oy!

01:46:14.119 --> 01:46:17.329
He's right.
Oh, Mother,
let's get out of here.

01:46:17.456 --> 01:46:21.375
We can't stay here now.

let's go.

we thought they had
come for us, didn't we?

01:46:40.687 --> 01:46:45.858
We thought it was the end.
Well, it was not the end.
We are alive. We are safe.

01:46:45.942 --> 01:46:49.236
We thank Thee,
O Lord, our God,
that in Thy infinite mercy,

01:46:49.321 --> 01:46:52.073

Saturday, the first
of January, 1944.

01:48:43.768 --> 01:48:49.106
Another new year has begun,
and we find ourselves
still in our hiding place.

01:48:54.279 --> 01:48:59.617
We have been here now
for one year, five months
and 25 days.

01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:05.748
One of our family
has left us.

01:49:10.212 --> 01:49:13.214
We're all a little thinner.

01:49:13.298 --> 01:49:17.718
The Van Daans' discussions
are as violent as ever.

01:49:17.802 --> 01:49:20.888
Mother still doesn't
understand me,

01:49:20.972 --> 01:49:24.141
but then
I don't understand her either.

01:49:27.812 --> 01:49:32.650
There is one great change, however.
A change in myself.

01:49:34.486 --> 01:49:39.990
I read somewhere that girls
of my age don't feel
quite certain of themselves,

01:49:40.075 --> 01:49:42.076
that they become
quiet within...

01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:45.996
and begin to think of the miracle
that is taking place in their bodies.

01:49:48.291 --> 01:49:53.087
I think that
what is happening to me
is so wonderful.

01:49:53.171 --> 01:49:58.676
Not only what can be seen,
but what is taking place inside.

01:50:00.178 --> 01:50:04.932
Each time it has happened,
I feel I have a sweet secret,

01:50:05.016 --> 01:50:10.688
and I long for the time
when I shall feel that secret
within me again.

Oh, thank you.
You shouldn't have come.

01:52:09.015 --> 01:52:13.227
You should have at least
one day to yourselves.

01:52:13.311 --> 01:52:16.063
Don't say that.
It's so wonderful
to see them.

01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:18.857
What is it?
What is it?
Mr. Kraler.

01:52:18.942 --> 01:52:22.736
- Happy New Year, Mr. Dussel.

Feeling any better?
I'm all right.

01:52:26.408 --> 01:52:28.367
We filled her full
of every kind of pill,

01:52:28.451 --> 01:52:31.829
so she won't cough
and make a noise.

01:52:31.913 --> 01:52:36.083
Look what Miep has brought us.
A cake.

01:52:36.167 --> 01:52:38.043
[All]
Mmm.

01:52:38.169 --> 01:52:41.797
Cake.
Well.

01:52:41.923 --> 01:52:45.884
I'll get some plates.
Thank you, Miepia.

01:52:45.969 --> 01:52:49.096
You must have used
all of your sugar rations
for weeks.

01:52:49.180 --> 01:52:53.016
It's beautiful,
isn't it?

01:52:53.101 --> 01:52:55.519
It's ages since
I've even seen a cake.

01:52:55.603 --> 01:52:57.604
Not since you brought
the one last year, remember?

01:52:57.689 --> 01:53:00.691
It had "Peace in 1943"
written on-

01:53:04.571 --> 01:53:06.697
"Peace in 1944."

01:53:08.533 --> 01:53:10.993
- Peace has to come
sometime, you know.
- Here you are.

01:53:10.994 --> 01:53:14.288
- Peace has to come
sometime, you know.
- Here you are.

01:53:14.372 --> 01:53:16.748
Now, how many of us
are there?

01:53:16.875 --> 01:53:18.959
None for me,
thank you.
Oh, you must.

01:53:19.043 --> 01:53:20.961
Please, Miep.

01:53:21.045 --> 01:53:25.340
Good. That leaves one,
two, three- seven of us.

01:53:25.425 --> 01:53:30.262
Eight. The same
as it always is.

01:53:30.346 --> 01:53:33.140
I left Margot out.
I take it for granted
Margot won't eat any.

01:53:33.266 --> 01:53:35.809
Why wouldn't she?
I think it
won't harm her.

01:53:35.894 --> 01:53:39.897
All right, all right.
I just didn't want her to
start coughing again.

01:53:41.316 --> 01:53:45.611
And, please,
Mrs. Frank
should cut the cake.

01:53:45.737 --> 01:53:49.781
What do you mean?
Well, Mrs. Frank
divides things better.

01:53:49.908 --> 01:53:54.578
Just what are you
trying to say?
Forget it. We're wasting time.

01:53:54.662 --> 01:53:57.956
No, no.
Don't I always give everybody
exactly the same?

01:53:59.918 --> 01:54:03.420
Don't I?
Forget it, Kerli.

01:54:03.505 --> 01:54:05.714
No, I want an answer.
Don't I?

01:54:05.798 --> 01:54:10.886
Yes. Yes, yes.
Everybody gets
exactly the same.

01:54:12.263 --> 01:54:14.973
Except Mr. Van Daan
gets a little bit more.

01:54:15.099 --> 01:54:18.644
That's a lie.
She always cuts the same.
Mr. Van Daan, please.

01:54:18.728 --> 01:54:21.688
You see, Miep,
what a little sugar cake
does to us?

01:54:21.773 --> 01:54:24.691
It goes right to our heads.

01:54:24.776 --> 01:54:28.946
Here you are,
Mrs. Frank.
Thank you.

01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:40.582
You sure you won't
have any?
Very sure.

01:54:42.085 --> 01:54:44.086
Miep?
No, thank you.
Really.

01:54:45.755 --> 01:54:49.925
[Exhales]
Cut the cake.
All right.

01:55:10.029 --> 01:55:12.030
Thank you, Peter.

01:55:16.327 --> 01:55:18.328
That's yours, Peter.

01:55:21.207 --> 01:55:23.792
Maybe Mouschi
went back to our house.

01:55:23.876 --> 01:55:27.254
[Peter]
Do you ever get over there?
Do you think that you could?

01:55:27.338 --> 01:55:30.465
I'm afraid with
him gone a week, Peter-

01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:34.678
Make up your mind.
Already someone has had
a big nice meal from that cat.

01:55:34.762 --> 01:55:36.680
[Kraler Chuckles]

01:55:41.603 --> 01:55:44.521
Mmm, it's delicious, Miep.
Delicious.

01:55:52.780 --> 01:55:55.866
Well, I must run.
There's a party tonight.

01:55:55.950 --> 01:55:58.619
How heavenly.

01:55:58.703 --> 01:56:00.787
Remember now
what everyone's wearing...

01:56:00.872 --> 01:56:03.957
and what you have to eat
and everything so you can
tell us tomorrow.

01:56:04.042 --> 01:56:06.918
I'll give you
a full report.
Good-bye, everyone.

01:56:07.045 --> 01:56:08.962
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Miep.

01:56:09.047 --> 01:56:12.799
Hey, just a minute.
There's something
I'd like you to do for me.

01:56:12.884 --> 01:56:15.385
Putti, where are you going?

01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:17.471
Putti, what are you
gonna do?

01:56:18.973 --> 01:56:21.391
Putti.

01:56:21.476 --> 01:56:23.769
No, no, no.
Don't you dare
take that coat.

01:56:23.853 --> 01:56:25.771
What is wrong?

01:56:25.855 --> 01:56:28.899
Father says he's gonna
sell her fur coat.

01:56:28.983 --> 01:56:30.942
She's crazy about
that old fur coat.

01:56:31.069 --> 01:56:34.112
It's mine, you hear me?
My father gave me that coat.
I want the coat.

01:56:34.238 --> 01:56:36.239
No, you have no right.
Get your hands off it.

01:56:36.324 --> 01:56:40.535
Is it possible
that anyone can...
be silly enough...

01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:43.705
to worry about a fur coat
at a time like this?

01:56:43.790 --> 01:56:45.832
It's none of
your darn business.

01:56:45.917 --> 01:56:48.418
And if you say
one more thing-
Peter.

01:56:49.420 --> 01:56:51.421
[Footsteps Approaching]

01:56:55.551 --> 01:56:57.594
Just a...

01:56:57.679 --> 01:57:01.807
little discussion
on the advisability
of selling this coat.

01:57:01.891 --> 01:57:03.975
As I have often
reminded Mrs. Van Daan,

01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:08.438
it's selfish of her to keep it
when people outside are in
such desperate need of clothing.

01:57:10.316 --> 01:57:12.359
So if you please
to sell it for us.

01:57:12.443 --> 01:57:14.528
It should fetch
a good price.

01:57:14.612 --> 01:57:17.364
And by the way,
would you get me cigarettes?

01:57:17.448 --> 01:57:20.450
I don't care
what kind they are.
Get all you can.

01:57:20.535 --> 01:57:23.870
It is very difficult
to get them, Mr. Van Daan.

01:57:23.955 --> 01:57:26.707
But I will try.
Good-bye.

01:57:26.833 --> 01:57:28.750
Good-bye.
Bye, Miep.

01:57:28.835 --> 01:57:30.836
Mr. Frank,
could I talk to you?

01:57:35.842 --> 01:57:38.885
Something's happened,
hasn't it, Mr. Kraler?
What's happened?

01:57:38.970 --> 01:57:42.681
If it is something
that concerns us here,
we'd better all hear it.

01:57:42.807 --> 01:57:46.935
The children-
What they'd imagine would be
worse than any reality.

01:57:47.019 --> 01:57:51.565
It is a man in the storeroom.
His name is Karl.
You knew him.

01:57:51.649 --> 01:57:54.985
One day he came to the office.
He closed the door
and asked me,

01:57:55.069 --> 01:57:57.529
"What do you hear from
your friend Mr. Frank?"

01:57:57.613 --> 01:58:00.532
I told him there was a rumor
that you were in Switzerland.

01:58:00.616 --> 01:58:04.703
He said he had heard
that rumor too, but he thought
I might know something more.

01:58:04.787 --> 01:58:07.831
I did not pay much attention.
I- I tried to forget it.

01:58:07.915 --> 01:58:10.584
And then yesterday...

01:58:10.668 --> 01:58:14.212
we were coming out of
the storeroom out there.

01:58:14.297 --> 01:58:17.799
I had started down
to the office.

01:58:17.884 --> 01:58:19.843
I looked back.

01:58:19.927 --> 01:58:22.554
He was standing,
staring at the bookcase.

01:58:22.638 --> 01:58:27.517
He said, "I thought
I remember a door up here.

01:58:27.602 --> 01:58:32.189
Was not there a door here
leading to the loft?"

01:58:32.273 --> 01:58:35.734
Then he asked me for more money.
Twenty gilders more a week.

01:58:35.818 --> 01:58:39.279
- Blackmail.
- Twenty gilders?
Very modest blackmail.

01:58:39.363 --> 01:58:41.531
That's just
the beginning.

01:58:42.742 --> 01:58:44.910
You know what I think?

01:58:44.994 --> 01:58:48.455
He's the thief who was
down there that night.

01:58:48.539 --> 01:58:50.624
That's how
he knows we're here.

01:58:50.708 --> 01:58:53.126
How was it left?
What did you tell him?

01:58:53.211 --> 01:58:55.504
I told him
I had to think about it.

01:58:55.588 --> 01:58:57.589
What shall I do?
Pay him the money?

01:58:57.673 --> 01:58:59.591
Take a chance
on firing him or what?

01:58:59.717 --> 01:59:02.928
I do not know.
For heaven's sakes,
don't fire him.

01:59:03.012 --> 01:59:06.598
Pay him what he asks.
Keep him here where you can
keep your eye on him.

01:59:06.682 --> 01:59:09.935
Is it so much that he is asking?
I mean, what are
they paying nowadays?

01:59:10.061 --> 01:59:12.145
He could get it
in a war plant.
Mm-hmm.

01:59:12.230 --> 01:59:17.025
But this is not a war plant.
Mind you, I do not know
if he knows or not.

01:59:21.447 --> 01:59:24.991
Offer him half.
Then we'll soon know
if it is blackmail or not.

01:59:25.076 --> 01:59:28.954
And if it is,
we've gotta pay, haven't we?
[Chuckles]

01:59:29.038 --> 01:59:31.164
Whatever he asks,
we've gotta pay.

Let us decide that
when the time comes.

01:59:35.253 --> 01:59:37.337
This may be all my imagination.

01:59:37.421 --> 01:59:41.508

I told her I had to go over
some papers in my office,

to call me here

Think how lucky we are.

02:01:05.968 --> 02:01:10.597

dying in the war every day.

Think of the people
in concentration camps.
What's the good of that?

you're already miserable?

You grown-ups
have had your chance.

Look at us. If we begin
thinking of all the horror
in the world, we're lost.

02:01:34.288 --> 02:01:37.123

to some kind of ideals,

You gave some of it
back to them just now.

We have problems here that
no other people our age have ever had.

and this is the first time
we've ever really talked.

It helps a lot to have someone
to talk to, doesn't it?

02:04:53.070 --> 02:04:55.738
you want to let off steam,

02:04:55.823 --> 02:04:57.991
you can come into my room.

02:04:59.285 --> 02:05:02.620
I can get up
an awful lot of steam.
[Chuckles]

02:05:02.705 --> 02:05:04.789
It's all right with me.

02:05:05.958 --> 02:05:07.917
Do you mean that?

02:05:11.130 --> 02:05:14.215
I said it, didn't I?

02:05:30.274 --> 02:05:30.732
Good night.
Good night.

02:05:30.733 --> 02:05:32.775
Good night.
Good night.

02:05:32.902 --> 02:05:35.528
Good night.
Good night.

02:05:45.789 --> 02:05:50.585
May I come in?
No, Mr. Dussel.
I'm not dressed yet.

02:05:50.669 --> 02:05:52.629
Oh.

02:06:17.154 --> 02:06:19.113
Margot.
Hmm?

02:06:19.198 --> 02:06:22.492
Tell me, am I terribly ugly?

02:06:22.618 --> 02:06:24.661
Oh, stop fishing.
No. Tell me.

02:06:24.745 --> 02:06:28.790
Of course you're not.
You've got nice eyes...

02:06:28.874 --> 02:06:32.710
and a lot of animation
and- and-

02:06:53.482 --> 02:06:55.692
- May I come in?
- Come in, Mother.

02:06:56.777 --> 02:06:59.237
Mr. Dussel is impatient
to get in here.

02:06:59.321 --> 02:07:02.240
[Anne]
He takes the room
for himself the entire day.

02:07:02.324 --> 02:07:05.159
You're not going in again
tonight to see Peter, hmm?

02:07:06.161 --> 02:07:08.579
That is my intention.

02:07:11.834 --> 02:07:14.794
Aren't you afraid
you're disturbing him?

02:07:14.878 --> 02:07:17.171
Mother, I have some intuition.

02:07:17.256 --> 02:07:19.424
Then may I ask you
this much, Annie?

02:07:19.508 --> 02:07:22.093
Please don't shut the door
when you go in.

02:07:24.805 --> 02:07:27.307
You sound like
Mrs. Van Daan.

02:07:27.391 --> 02:07:30.685
Oh, no. I don't mean
to suggest anything wrong.

02:07:30.769 --> 02:07:33.938
I only wish you wouldn't
expose yourself to criticism.

02:07:34.023 --> 02:07:37.942
I'm sorry, Mother.
I'm going to Peter's room.

02:07:38.027 --> 02:07:41.821
I'm not going to let
Petronella Van Daan
spoil our friendship.

02:07:47.703 --> 02:07:49.787
Just a moment, Mr. Dussel.

02:07:52.666 --> 02:07:55.126
In my day the boys
called on the girls.

02:07:55.210 --> 02:07:58.921
[Mrs. Frank] You know how
young people are. Peter's room
is the only place they can talk.

02:07:59.006 --> 02:08:01.007
Talk?

02:08:01.091 --> 02:08:03.593
That's not what they called it
when I was a girl.

02:08:06.096 --> 02:08:10.099
I'm sorry, Margot,
that you have to be
the one left out.

02:08:11.894 --> 02:08:14.520
I feel so guilty about you.

02:08:14.605 --> 02:08:16.814
Why?

02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:21.444
I mean, every time
I go to Peter-

02:08:21.528 --> 02:08:25.239
into Peter's room,
I have the feeling
that I'm hurting you.

02:08:26.909 --> 02:08:30.078
I know if it were me,
I'd be desperately jealous.

02:08:32.915 --> 02:08:34.874
I am jealous a little.

02:08:34.958 --> 02:08:36.959
Not of you and Peter.

02:08:38.253 --> 02:08:40.213
I'm-

02:08:40.297 --> 02:08:43.591
I'm only feeling sorry
that I haven't anyone...

02:08:43.675 --> 02:08:46.552
with whom to-
to discuss my feelings.

02:08:46.637 --> 02:08:48.554
Margot, I won't even-

02:08:48.639 --> 02:08:52.433
Listen, you've found
a companionship,
and I want you to enjoy it.

02:08:52.518 --> 02:08:57.146
Only... in my heart I feel
that I've got a right to share
feelings with someone too.

02:08:59.650 --> 02:09:04.278
But I'm sure that Peter-
that that boy, he could just
never be that person for me.

02:09:04.363 --> 02:09:06.280
[Knocking On Door]

02:09:06.365 --> 02:09:08.908
Maybe there's nothing
to be jealous about.

02:09:10.494 --> 02:09:12.870
Maybe I'm just
taking the place of his cat.

02:09:12.955 --> 02:09:14.872
Will you please let me
in my room?

02:09:14.957 --> 02:09:18.501
[Anne]
Just a minute,
dear, dear Mr. Dussel.

02:09:29.471 --> 02:09:32.265
Well, here I go...

02:09:32.349 --> 02:09:34.308
to run the gauntlet.

02:09:37.271 --> 02:09:39.313
Thank you so much.

02:09:47.531 --> 02:09:49.532
[Heel Snaps]

02:09:51.201 --> 02:09:53.619
Look at her.

02:09:53.704 --> 02:09:57.373
A lot of good it did me
to have a son.
I never see him.

02:09:59.209 --> 02:10:01.210
Just a minute, dear.

02:10:02.671 --> 02:10:06.382
I'd like to say
a few words to my son.
Do you mind?

02:10:06.467 --> 02:10:10.052
Peter, I do not want you staying
up till all hours tonight.

02:10:10.137 --> 02:10:12.180
You need your sleep.
You are a growing boy.

02:10:12.264 --> 02:10:15.850
Anne won't stay late.
She's going to bed
promptly at 9:00.

02:10:15.976 --> 02:10:19.812
Aren't you, Anne?
Yes, Mother. May we go now?

02:10:19.897 --> 02:10:22.190
[Mrs. Frank]
Listen for the chimes, dear.

02:10:42.127 --> 02:10:44.253
Aren't they impossible?

02:10:45.964 --> 02:10:49.091
Treating us as if
we're still in the nursery.

02:10:50.677 --> 02:10:53.679
Don't let it bother you.
It- It doesn't bother me.

02:10:57.768 --> 02:11:00.144
I suppose you can't
really blame them.

02:11:01.522 --> 02:11:04.273
They think back
to what they were like
at our age.

02:11:05.567 --> 02:11:09.278
They don't realize
how much more advanced
we are.

02:11:11.031 --> 02:11:13.032
[Explosions]

02:11:17.454 --> 02:11:20.122
[Sighs]

02:11:20.207 --> 02:11:22.959
Already I know
what I want to do.
Don't you?

02:11:24.127 --> 02:11:27.088
I want to be
a journalist
or something.

02:11:27.172 --> 02:11:29.173
I love to write.

02:11:30.592 --> 02:11:32.593
What do you want to do?

02:11:34.721 --> 02:11:36.722
I know
what I'd like right now.

02:11:36.807 --> 02:11:40.351
I'd like to make it to England,
get with the Free Dutch Forces
over there.

02:11:40.435 --> 02:11:43.563
Peter, you wouldn't
try a thing like that.

02:11:44.565 --> 02:11:47.984
You'd never make it.
I'd make it.

02:11:53.115 --> 02:11:55.866
Only a few of the hundreds
that try do.

02:11:57.661 --> 02:12:01.831
I know, but... I'd like to get in it
and- and hit back.

02:12:01.915 --> 02:12:05.209
To just sit here, it's not for me.

02:12:10.424 --> 02:12:12.717
You like Margot, don't you?

02:12:12.801 --> 02:12:14.719
Right from the start
you liked her.

02:12:14.803 --> 02:12:16.721
Liked her better than me.

02:12:18.557 --> 02:12:20.558
Oh, I don't know.

02:12:20.642 --> 02:12:22.560
It's all right.

02:12:22.644 --> 02:12:24.770
Everyone feels that way.

02:12:24.855 --> 02:12:26.981
Margot's so good.

02:12:27.065 --> 02:12:31.611
She's sweet and bright
and beautiful, and I'm not.

02:12:31.695 --> 02:12:33.613
I wouldn't say that.

02:12:33.697 --> 02:12:36.866
Oh, no, I'm not.
I know that.

02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:40.077
I know quite well
that I'm not a beauty.

02:12:40.162 --> 02:12:42.330
I never have been
and never shall be.

02:12:42.414 --> 02:12:45.166
I don't agree at all.

02:12:47.002 --> 02:12:49.587
I think you're pretty.

02:12:49.671 --> 02:12:51.714
That's not true.

02:12:51.798 --> 02:12:54.216
A-And another thing.

02:12:54.301 --> 02:12:57.470
You've changed.
From the first, I mean.

02:12:57.554 --> 02:12:59.597
I have?

02:13:01.725 --> 02:13:05.561
I used to think that
you were awful noisy.

02:13:05.646 --> 02:13:09.231
And what
do you think now, Peter?

02:13:09.316 --> 02:13:11.275
How have I changed?

02:13:12.819 --> 02:13:15.404
Well, you-

02:13:15.489 --> 02:13:17.406
You're quieter.

02:13:20.410 --> 02:13:22.912
I'm glad
you donâ€™t just hate me.

02:13:23.997 --> 02:13:25.998
I never said that.

02:13:47.979 --> 02:13:51.774
I bet when you get out of here,
you'll never think of me again.

02:13:53.151 --> 02:13:55.236
That's crazy.

02:13:56.738 --> 02:13:58.823
When you get back
with all your friends,

02:13:58.907 --> 02:14:00.866
you're going to say,

02:14:00.951 --> 02:14:03.703
"Now, what did I ever see
in that Miss Quack-Quack?"

02:14:04.996 --> 02:14:08.499
I haven't got any friends.
Peter, of course you have.

02:14:09.668 --> 02:14:12.002
Everyone has friends.

02:14:12.087 --> 02:14:15.256
Not me. I don't want any.

02:14:15.340 --> 02:14:17.800
I get along fine without 'em.

02:14:20.637 --> 02:14:23.764
Does that mean you can
get along without me too?

02:14:25.934 --> 02:14:28.769
I think of myself
as your friend.

02:14:29.980 --> 02:14:32.857
No.

02:14:32.941 --> 02:14:35.651
If they were all like you,

02:14:35.736 --> 02:14:37.653
it'd be different.

02:14:37.738 --> 02:14:40.740
[Explosions]

02:14:48.331 --> 02:14:51.417
Peter-
Hmm?

02:14:51.501 --> 02:14:53.836
Did you ever kiss a girl?

02:14:57.841 --> 02:14:59.800
Yes.

02:14:59.885 --> 02:15:01.844
Once.

02:15:02.846 --> 02:15:05.139
Was she pretty?

02:15:05.223 --> 02:15:07.933
The girl you kissed.

02:15:08.018 --> 02:15:10.770
I don't know.
I was blindfolded.

02:15:10.854 --> 02:15:13.439
It was at a party.
One of those kissing games.

02:15:13.523 --> 02:15:15.441
Oh.

02:15:15.525 --> 02:15:18.110
I don't suppose that
really counts, does it?

02:15:20.655 --> 02:15:22.698
It didn't with me.

02:15:24.868 --> 02:15:26.869
I've been kissed twice.

02:15:29.539 --> 02:15:32.750
Once a man
I'd never seen before
kissed me on the cheek...

02:15:32.834 --> 02:15:34.960
when he picked me up
off the ice.

02:15:36.046 --> 02:15:38.047
I was crying.

02:15:39.716 --> 02:15:44.178
And the other was
a friend of Father's
who kissed my hand.

02:15:47.224 --> 02:15:50.226
You wouldn't say those
counted, would you?

02:15:51.812 --> 02:15:54.563
[Clears Throat]
I wouldn't say so.

02:15:54.648 --> 02:15:56.774
[Explosion]

02:16:07.577 --> 02:16:09.662
I know almost for certain...

02:16:09.746 --> 02:16:13.582
Margot would never
kiss anyone unless
she was engaged to them.

02:16:17.254 --> 02:16:20.923
And I'm sure too
that Mother never
touched a man before Father.

02:16:24.052 --> 02:16:26.011
But I don't know.

02:16:27.013 --> 02:16:29.265
Things are so different now.

02:16:31.101 --> 02:16:33.269
What do you think?

02:16:34.771 --> 02:16:37.189
Do you think a girl
shouldn't kiss anyone...

02:16:37.273 --> 02:16:39.941
except if she's engaged
or something?

02:16:43.947 --> 02:16:47.074
It's so hard
to try to think what to do,

02:16:48.576 --> 02:16:52.413
when here we are
with the whole world
falling around our ears.

02:16:53.915 --> 02:16:56.959
And you think,

02:16:57.043 --> 02:17:00.170
well, you don't know what's
going to happen tomorrow.

02:17:02.924 --> 02:17:04.842
What do you think?

02:17:06.093 --> 02:17:08.554
Well, uh,

02:17:08.638 --> 02:17:11.682
I suppose it-
it depends on the girl.

02:17:13.476 --> 02:17:17.313
With some, n-no matter
what they do, it's wrong.

02:17:18.356 --> 02:17:20.316
But others,

02:17:21.817 --> 02:17:24.570
it wouldn't necessarily
be wrong with them.

02:17:24.654 --> 02:17:26.822
[Bell Tolling]
I always thought that...

02:17:26.906 --> 02:17:28.824
when two people-

02:17:28.909 --> 02:17:31.035
I think I should go now.

02:17:32.370 --> 02:17:35.331
[Tolling Continues]
That's right.

02:17:38.501 --> 02:17:40.502
Good night.

02:17:45.508 --> 02:17:49.344
You won't let 'em
stop you from coming?
No.

02:17:50.347 --> 02:17:53.223
I might bring my diary.

02:17:53.308 --> 02:17:56.852
There are so many
things in it I want to
talk over with you.

02:17:56.937 --> 02:17:59.103
There's a lot about you.

02:17:59.189 --> 02:18:01.147
What kind of things?

02:18:03.817 --> 02:18:06.195
Well,

02:18:06.279 --> 02:18:08.572
I wouldn't want you
to see some of it.

02:18:09.574 --> 02:18:11.867
I thought you were nothing.

02:18:12.911 --> 02:18:15.245
Just the way
you thought about me.

02:18:17.665 --> 02:18:19.875
Did you change your mind,

02:18:21.085 --> 02:18:23.545
the way I changed my mind
about you?

02:18:25.340 --> 02:18:27.841
Well, you'll see.

02:19:47.589 --> 02:19:49.590
Good night, Annele.

02:19:54.846 --> 02:19:56.847
Good night, angel.
Good night.

02:20:14.115 --> 02:20:18.035
[Door Opens, Closes]

02:20:23.374 --> 02:20:25.334
Mm-hmm.

02:20:38.139 --> 02:20:40.766
[Anne Narrating]
Outside there is
a quiet excitement.

02:20:40.850 --> 02:20:42.059
Invasion fever is mounting
from day to day,

02:20:42.060 --> 02:20:43.936
Invasion fever is mounting
from day to day,

02:20:44.020 --> 02:20:47.022
and people talk of nothing else
but the hope of liberation.

02:20:48.024 --> 02:20:49.942
It had best come soon.

02:20:50.026 --> 02:20:52.486
We here have had bad news.

02:20:52.570 --> 02:20:56.490
The people from whom
Miep got our ration cards
have been arrested.

02:20:58.493 --> 02:21:01.745
Mr. Kraler is in the hospital.

02:21:01.830 --> 02:21:04.456
It seems he has ulcers.

02:21:04.541 --> 02:21:07.042
I'm afraid we are his ulcers.

and us too.

thinner and thinner.

moan in his sleep,

And you come down in the night
and steal food that should
go to them, the children.

02:26:24.193 --> 02:26:26.319
He needs more food
than the rest of us.

02:28:29.610 --> 02:28:33.905
you would never forget
what he did for you when
you first came to Holland.

02:28:33.990 --> 02:28:36.241
You said you never
would be able to repay him.

02:28:36.325 --> 02:28:39.911
If my husband had
any obligations to you,
he has paid it over and over.

02:28:39.996 --> 02:28:43.540
Edith, I don't know you.
I've never seen you like this.

02:28:43.624 --> 02:28:46.126
I should have
spoken out long ago.

02:28:46.210 --> 02:28:48.378
You can't be nice
to some people.

02:28:48.462 --> 02:28:51.548
There would have been plenty
for all of us if you hadn't
come in here!

02:50:24.048 --> 02:50:26.633
[Thuds]

02:50:26.718 --> 02:50:29.970
[Crashing, Thumping]

02:50:34.642 --> 02:50:38.228
[Anne Narrating]
And so it seems our stay here is over.

02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:42.733
They've given us just a moment
to get our things.

02:50:42.817 --> 02:50:44.943
We can each take a bag...

02:50:45.028 --> 02:50:47.029
and whatever it will hold
of clothing.

02:50:48.114 --> 02:50:50.866
Nothing else.
[Seagulls Squawking]

02:50:50.950 --> 02:50:52.993
So, dear... Diary,

02:50:54.996 --> 02:50:57.748
that means
I must leave you behind.

02:50:59.375 --> 02:51:01.919
Good-bye for a while.

02:51:03.046 --> 02:51:06.506
P.S.
Please, please, anyone,

02:51:07.884 --> 02:51:10.510
if you should find this diary,

02:51:10.595 --> 02:51:13.430
will you please
keep it safe for me,

02:51:13.514 --> 02:51:15.849
because someday I hope that-

02:51:19.771 --> 02:51:21.813
No more.

02:51:23.024 --> 02:51:25.943
I had gone to the country
to try to find food.

02:51:26.027 --> 02:51:28.987
When I got back,
the police were in the building.

02:51:29.072 --> 02:51:32.115
We made it our business
to learn how they knew.

02:51:32.200 --> 02:51:34.117
It was the thief
who told them.

02:51:34.202 --> 02:51:36.161
We know the thief.
He was-

02:51:36.245 --> 02:51:38.872
It seems strange to me now,

02:51:38.957 --> 02:51:43.293
but we were all so full of hope
in the camp here in Holland
where they first took us.

02:51:43.378 --> 02:51:45.796
The news of the war was good.

02:51:45.880 --> 02:51:48.256
The British and Americans
were sweeping through France.

02:51:48.341 --> 02:51:51.426
We felt sure they would
get to us in time to-

02:51:53.388 --> 02:51:55.389
But...

02:51:56.432 --> 02:51:58.392
in September
we were shipped to Poland.

02:51:58.476 --> 02:52:01.645
The men to one camp,
the women to another.

02:52:03.398 --> 02:52:07.693
From there...
they were sent to Belsen.

02:52:07.777 --> 02:52:10.404
I stayed in Auschwitz.

02:52:10.488 --> 02:52:13.782
In January we were freed,
the few of us who were left.

02:52:15.076 --> 02:52:17.244
The war was not yet over, no.

02:52:19.747 --> 02:52:23.000
It took us a long time
to get home.

02:52:23.084 --> 02:52:25.752
Each time the train
would stop, we'd...

02:52:25.837 --> 02:52:28.797
all get out, you know,
at a siding or a crossing, and...

02:52:28.881 --> 02:52:31.091
walk from group to group.

02:52:32.468 --> 02:52:34.594
"Where were you?"

02:52:34.679 --> 02:52:36.596
"Were you at Belsen?"

02:52:36.681 --> 02:52:38.890
"At Buchenwald?"

02:52:38.975 --> 02:52:41.852
"At Mauthausen? Where?"

02:52:41.936 --> 02:52:44.354
"Is it possible that
you ever knew my wife?"

02:52:44.439 --> 02:52:47.357
"Did you ever see
my husband, my son,

02:52:47.442 --> 02:52:49.443
my daughter?"

02:52:57.243 --> 02:53:00.537
That's how I found out
about my wife's death,

02:53:00.621 --> 02:53:04.041
Margot's, Van Daans',

02:53:04.125 --> 02:53:07.085
Peter, Dussel.

02:53:08.337 --> 02:53:10.338
But...

02:53:11.466 --> 02:53:13.425
Anne-

02:53:13.509 --> 02:53:15.635
I still hoped-

02:53:16.637 --> 02:53:21.016
Yesterday I was in Rotterdam.

02:53:21.100 --> 02:53:24.102
I met a woman there.

02:53:24.187 --> 02:53:27.397
She'd been in Belsen...
with Anne.

02:53:32.111 --> 02:53:34.112
I know now.

02:53:41.788 --> 02:53:43.789
[Seagulls Squawking]

02:53:48.503 --> 02:53:50.796
[Anne]
In spite of everything,

02:53:50.880 --> 02:53:55.425
I still believe that people
are really good at heart.

02:53:55.510 --> 02:53:58.220
She puts me to shame.

02:54:05.478 --> 02:54:07.521
