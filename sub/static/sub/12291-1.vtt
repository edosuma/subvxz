I try to bring good news.
Yes, I know.

56:40.857 --> 56:43.358
Something has happened.
A man came to me.

56:43.443 --> 56:46.361
He told me that
he has a Jewish friend- a dentist.

56:46.446 --> 56:50.365
He begged me,
could I find him a hiding place?
So I have come to you.

56:50.450 --> 56:53.744
I know it is a terrible thing to ask,
living the way you are,

56:53.828 --> 56:56.830
but could you take him in?

56:56.915 --> 57:00.084
Well, of course
we will.
His name is Jan Dussel.

57:00.168 --> 57:04.588
Dussel. Wait a minute.
I think I know him.
It's fine to have him.

57:04.672 --> 57:07.424
But, Otto, where are
we going to put him? Where?

57:07.509 --> 57:09.718
There's so little food as it is,
and to take in another person-

57:09.803 --> 57:11.720
We can stretch the food
a little, Mr. Van Daan.

57:11.846 --> 57:14.431
He can have my bed.
No, thank you, Peter.

57:14.516 --> 57:16.975

in here with us,
and he can have her bed.

What can I say to thank you?

58:39.350 --> 58:43.228
Mr. Kraler and Miep,
they're our lifeline.
Without them, we couldn't live.

58:43.313 --> 58:46.106
Please, you make us
seem very heroic.
It isn't that at all.

58:46.232 --> 58:51.111

you escaped to Switzerland.

And you've been here
all this time?
Ever since July.

59:43.289 --> 59:47.251
Did Mr. Kraler warn you
you won't get much to eat here?

59:47.335 --> 59:52.506
You can imagine...
three ration cards
among the seven of us.

59:52.590 --> 59:55.926
Now you make eight.

59:56.010 --> 59:59.471
Mr. Van Daan, you don't realize
what's happening outside...

59:59.555 --> 01:00:02.224
that you should warn me
of a thing like that.

01:00:03.685 --> 01:00:08.355
You don't realize what's going on
right here in Amsterdam.

01:00:08.439 --> 01:00:10.649
Every day, hundreds
of Jews disappear.

01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:17.656
They surround a block,
and they search
house by house.

01:00:19.409 --> 01:00:24.079
Every day children
come home from school
to find their parents gone.

01:00:25.415 --> 01:00:27.416
Hundreds are being deported.

Bring only what
you can carry.

01:00:45.685 --> 01:00:49.104
If you don't go, they come
and drag you from your home...

01:00:49.188 --> 01:00:52.107
and ship you off to Mauthausen-
the death camp.

that things had got
so much worse.

She returned home from school
to find her parents gone.

01:01:23.139 --> 01:01:27.476

and then they came
and took her away.

01:52:28.451 --> 01:52:31.829
so she won't cough
and make a noise.

01:52:31.913 --> 01:52:36.083
Look what Miep has brought us.
A cake.

01:52:36.167 --> 01:52:38.043
[All]
Mmm.

01:52:38.169 --> 01:52:41.797
Cake.
Well.

01:52:41.923 --> 01:52:45.884
I'll get some plates.
Thank you, Miepia.

01:52:45.969 --> 01:52:49.096
You must have used
all of your sugar rations
for weeks.

01:52:49.180 --> 01:52:53.016
It's beautiful,
isn't it?

01:52:53.101 --> 01:52:55.519
It's ages since
I've even seen a cake.

01:52:55.603 --> 01:52:57.604
Not since you brought
the one last year, remember?

01:52:57.689 --> 01:53:00.691
It had "Peace in 1943"
written on-

01:53:04.571 --> 01:53:06.697
"Peace in 1944."

01:53:08.533 --> 01:53:10.993
- Peace has to come
sometime, you know.
- Here you are.

01:53:10.994 --> 01:53:14.288
- Peace has to come
sometime, you know.
- Here you are.

01:53:14.372 --> 01:53:16.748
Now, how many of us
are there?

01:53:16.875 --> 01:53:18.959
None for me,
thank you.
Oh, you must.

01:53:19.043 --> 01:53:20.961
Please, Miep.

01:53:21.045 --> 01:53:25.340
Good. That leaves one,
two, three- seven of us.

01:53:25.425 --> 01:53:30.262
Eight. The same
as it always is.

01:53:30.346 --> 01:53:33.140
I left Margot out.
I take it for granted
Margot won't eat any.

01:53:33.266 --> 01:53:35.809
Why wouldn't she?
I think it
won't harm her.

01:53:35.894 --> 01:53:39.897
All right, all right.
I just didn't want her to
start coughing again.

01:53:41.316 --> 01:53:45.611
And, please,
Mrs. Frank
should cut the cake.

01:53:45.737 --> 01:53:49.781
What do you mean?
Well, Mrs. Frank
divides things better.

01:53:49.908 --> 01:53:54.578
Just what are you
trying to say?
Forget it. We're wasting time.

01:53:54.662 --> 01:53:57.956
No, no.
Don't I always give everybody
exactly the same?

01:53:59.918 --> 01:54:03.420
Don't I?
Forget it, Kerli.

01:54:03.505 --> 01:54:05.714
No, I want an answer.
Don't I?

01:54:05.798 --> 01:54:10.886
Yes. Yes, yes.
Everybody gets
exactly the same.

01:54:12.263 --> 01:54:14.973
Except Mr. Van Daan
gets a little bit more.

01:54:15.099 --> 01:54:18.644
That's a lie.
She always cuts the same.
Mr. Van Daan, please.

01:54:18.728 --> 01:54:21.688
You see, Miep,
what a little sugar cake
does to us?

01:54:21.773 --> 01:54:24.691
It goes right to our heads.

01:54:24.776 --> 01:54:28.946
Here you are,
Mrs. Frank.
Thank you.

01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:40.582
You sure you won't
have any?
Very sure.

01:54:42.085 --> 01:54:44.086
Miep?
No, thank you.
Really.

01:54:45.755 --> 01:54:49.925
[Exhales]
Cut the cake.
All right.

01:55:10.029 --> 01:55:12.030
Thank you, Peter.

01:55:16.327 --> 01:55:18.328
That's yours, Peter.

01:55:21.207 --> 01:55:23.792
Maybe Mouschi
went back to our house.

01:55:23.876 --> 01:55:27.254
[Peter]
Do you ever get over there?
Do you think that you could?

01:55:27.338 --> 01:55:30.465
I'm afraid with
him gone a week, Peter-

01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:34.678
Make up your mind.
Already someone has had
a big nice meal from that cat.

01:55:34.762 --> 01:55:36.680
[Kraler Chuckles]

01:55:41.603 --> 01:55:44.521
Mmm, it's delicious, Miep.
Delicious.

01:55:52.780 --> 01:55:55.866
Well, I must run.
There's a party tonight.

01:55:55.950 --> 01:55:58.619
How heavenly.

01:55:58.703 --> 01:56:00.787
Remember now
what everyone's wearing...

01:56:00.872 --> 01:56:03.957
and what you have to eat
and everything so you can
tell us tomorrow.

01:56:04.042 --> 01:56:06.918
I'll give you
a full report.
Good-bye, everyone.

01:56:07.045 --> 01:56:08.962
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Miep.

01:56:09.047 --> 01:56:12.799
Hey, just a minute.
There's something
I'd like you to do for me.

01:56:12.884 --> 01:56:15.385
Putti, where are you going?

01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:17.471
Putti, what are you
gonna do?

01:56:18.973 --> 01:56:21.391
Putti.

01:56:21.476 --> 01:56:23.769
No, no, no.
Don't you dare
take that coat.

01:56:23.853 --> 01:56:25.771
What is wrong?

01:56:25.855 --> 01:56:28.899
Father says he's gonna
sell her fur coat.

01:56:28.983 --> 01:56:30.942
She's crazy about
that old fur coat.

01:56:31.069 --> 01:56:34.112
It's mine, you hear me?
My father gave me that coat.
I want the coat.

01:56:34.238 --> 01:56:36.239
No, you have no right.
Get your hands off it.

01:56:36.324 --> 01:56:40.535
Is it possible
that anyone can...
be silly enough...

01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:43.705
to worry about a fur coat
at a time like this?

01:56:43.790 --> 01:56:45.832
It's none of
your darn business.

01:56:45.917 --> 01:56:48.418
And if you say
one more thing-
Peter.

01:56:49.420 --> 01:56:51.421
[Footsteps Approaching]

01:56:55.551 --> 01:56:57.594
Just a...

01:56:57.679 --> 01:57:01.807
little discussion
on the advisability
of selling this coat.

01:57:01.891 --> 01:57:03.975
As I have often
reminded Mrs. Van Daan,

01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:08.438
it's selfish of her to keep it
when people outside are in
such desperate need of clothing.

01:57:10.316 --> 01:57:12.359
So if you please
to sell it for us.

01:57:12.443 --> 01:57:14.528
It should fetch
a good price.

01:57:14.612 --> 01:57:17.364
And by the way,
would you get me cigarettes?

01:57:17.448 --> 01:57:20.450
I don't care
what kind they are.
Get all you can.

01:57:20.535 --> 01:57:23.870
It is very difficult
to get them, Mr. Van Daan.

01:57:23.955 --> 01:57:26.707
But I will try.
Good-bye.

01:57:26.833 --> 01:57:28.750
Good-bye.
Bye, Miep.

01:57:28.835 --> 01:57:30.836
Mr. Frank,
could I talk to you?

01:57:35.842 --> 01:57:38.885
Something's happened,
hasn't it, Mr. Kraler?
What's happened?

01:57:38.970 --> 01:57:42.681
If it is something
that concerns us here,
we'd better all hear it.

01:57:42.807 --> 01:57:46.935
The children-
What they'd imagine would be
worse than any reality.

01:57:47.019 --> 01:57:51.565
It is a man in the storeroom.
His name is Karl.
You knew him.

01:57:51.649 --> 01:57:54.985
One day he came to the office.
He closed the door
and asked me,

01:57:55.069 --> 01:57:57.529
"What do you hear from
your friend Mr. Frank?"

01:57:57.613 --> 01:58:00.532
I told him there was a rumor
that you were in Switzerland.

01:58:00.616 --> 01:58:04.703
He said he had heard
that rumor too, but he thought
I might know something more.

01:58:04.787 --> 01:58:07.831
I did not pay much attention.
I- I tried to forget it.

01:58:07.915 --> 01:58:10.584
And then yesterday...

01:58:10.668 --> 01:58:14.212
we were coming out of
the storeroom out there.

01:58:14.297 --> 01:58:17.799
I had started down
to the office.

01:58:17.884 --> 01:58:19.843
I looked back.

01:58:19.927 --> 01:58:22.554
He was standing,
staring at the bookcase.

01:58:22.638 --> 01:58:27.517
He said, "I thought
I remember a door up here.

01:58:27.602 --> 01:58:32.189
Was not there a door here
leading to the loft?"

01:58:32.273 --> 01:58:35.734
Then he asked me for more money.
Twenty gilders more a week.

01:58:35.818 --> 01:58:39.279
- Blackmail.
- Twenty gilders?
Very modest blackmail.

01:58:39.363 --> 01:58:41.531
That's just
the beginning.

01:58:42.742 --> 01:58:44.910
You know what I think?

01:58:44.994 --> 01:58:48.455
He's the thief who was
down there that night.

01:58:48.539 --> 01:58:50.624
That's how
he knows we're here.

01:58:50.708 --> 01:58:53.126
How was it left?
What did you tell him?

01:58:53.211 --> 01:58:55.504
I told him
I had to think about it.

01:58:55.588 --> 01:58:57.589
What shall I do?
Pay him the money?

01:58:57.673 --> 01:58:59.591
Take a chance
on firing him or what?

01:58:59.717 --> 01:59:02.928
I do not know.
For heaven's sakes,
don't fire him.

01:59:03.012 --> 01:59:06.598
Pay him what he asks.
Keep him here where you can
keep your eye on him.

01:59:06.682 --> 01:59:09.935
Is it so much that he is asking?
I mean, what are
they paying nowadays?

01:59:10.061 --> 01:59:12.145
He could get it
in a war plant.
Mm-hmm.

01:59:12.230 --> 01:59:17.025
But this is not a war plant.
Mind you, I do not know
if he knows or not.

01:59:21.447 --> 01:59:24.991
Offer him half.
Then we'll soon know
if it is blackmail or not.

01:59:25.076 --> 01:59:28.954
And if it is,
we've gotta pay, haven't we?
[Chuckles]

01:59:29.038 --> 01:59:31.164
Whatever he asks,
we've gotta pay.

Let us decide that
when the time comes.

01:59:35.253 --> 01:59:37.337
This may be all my imagination.

01:59:37.421 --> 01:59:41.508

That's my wife.
I told her I had to go over
some papers in my office,

to call me here

Think how lucky we are.

02:01:05.968 --> 02:01:10.597
Think of the thousands
dying in the war every day.

02:01:10.681 --> 02:01:13.683
Think of the people
in concentration camps.
What's the good of that?

thinking of misery when
you're already miserable?

You grown-ups
have had your chance.

02:01:29.033 --> 02:01:34.204
Look at us. If we begin
thinking of all the horror
in the world, we're lost.

02:01:34.288 --> 02:01:37.123
We're trying to hold on
to some kind of ideals,

everything is being destroyed.

02:01:43.339 --> 02:01:46.466

about somebody eating him,

You gave some of it
back to them just now.

We have problems here that
no other people our age have ever had.

that I have any sense.

and this is the first time
we've ever really talked.

It helps a lot to have someone
to talk to, doesn't it?

02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:33.091

02:04:55.823 --> 02:04:57.991
you can come into my room.

02:04:59.285 --> 02:05:02.620
I can get up
an awful lot of steam.
[Chuckles]

02:05:02.705 --> 02:05:04.789
It's all right with me.

02:05:05.958 --> 02:05:07.917
Do you mean that?

02:05:11.130 --> 02:05:14.215
I said it, didn't I?

02:05:30.274 --> 02:05:30.732
Good night.
Good night.

02:05:30.733 --> 02:05:32.775
Good night.
Good night.

02:05:32.902 --> 02:05:35.528
Good night.
Good night.

02:05:45.789 --> 02:05:50.585
May I come in?
No, Mr. Dussel.
I'm not dressed yet.

02:05:50.669 --> 02:05:52.629
Oh.

02:06:17.154 --> 02:06:19.113
Margot.
Hmm?

02:06:19.198 --> 02:06:22.492
Tell me, am I terribly ugly?

02:06:22.618 --> 02:06:24.661
Oh, stop fishing.
No. Tell me.

02:06:24.745 --> 02:06:28.790
Of course you're not.
You've got nice eyes...

02:06:28.874 --> 02:06:32.710
and a lot of animation
and- and-

02:06:53.482 --> 02:06:55.692
- May I come in?
- Come in, Mother.

02:06:56.777 --> 02:06:59.237
Mr. Dussel is impatient
to get in here.

02:06:59.321 --> 02:07:02.240
[Anne]
He takes the room
for himself the entire day.

02:07:02.324 --> 02:07:05.159
You're not going in again
tonight to see Peter, hmm?

02:07:06.161 --> 02:07:08.579
That is my intention.

02:07:11.834 --> 02:07:14.794
Aren't you afraid
you're disturbing him?

02:07:14.878 --> 02:07:17.171
Mother, I have some intuition.

02:07:17.256 --> 02:07:19.424
Then may I ask you
this much, Annie?

02:07:19.508 --> 02:07:22.093
Please don't shut the door
when you go in.

02:07:24.805 --> 02:07:27.307
You sound like
Mrs. Van Daan.

02:07:27.391 --> 02:07:30.685
Oh, no. I don't mean
to suggest anything wrong.

02:07:30.769 --> 02:07:33.938
I only wish you wouldn't
expose yourself to criticism.

02:07:34.023 --> 02:07:37.942
I'm sorry, Mother.
I'm going to Peter's room.

02:07:38.027 --> 02:07:41.821
I'm not going to let
Petronella Van Daan
spoil our friendship.

02:07:47.703 --> 02:07:49.787
Just a moment, Mr. Dussel.

02:07:52.666 --> 02:07:55.126
In my day the boys
called on the girls.

02:07:55.210 --> 02:07:58.921
[Mrs. Frank] You know how
young people are. Peter's room
is the only place they can talk.

02:07:59.006 --> 02:08:01.007
Talk?

02:08:01.091 --> 02:08:03.593
That's not what they called it
when I was a girl.

02:08:06.096 --> 02:08:10.099
I'm sorry, Margot,
that you have to be
the one left out.

02:08:11.894 --> 02:08:14.520
I feel so guilty about you.

02:08:14.605 --> 02:08:16.814
Why?

02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:21.444
I mean, every time
I go to Peter-

02:08:21.528 --> 02:08:25.239
into Peter's room,
I have the feeling
that I'm hurting you.

02:08:26.909 --> 02:08:30.078
I know if it were me,
I'd be desperately jealous.

02:08:32.915 --> 02:08:34.874
I am jealous a little.

02:08:34.958 --> 02:08:36.959
Not of you and Peter.

02:08:38.253 --> 02:08:40.213
I'm-

02:08:40.297 --> 02:08:43.591
I'm only feeling sorry
that I haven't anyone...

02:08:43.675 --> 02:08:46.552
with whom to-
to discuss my feelings.

02:08:46.637 --> 02:08:48.554
Margot, I won't even-

02:08:48.639 --> 02:08:52.433
Listen, you've found
a companionship,
and I want you to enjoy it.

02:08:52.518 --> 02:08:57.146
Only... in my heart I feel
that I've got a right to share
feelings with someone too.

02:08:59.650 --> 02:09:04.278
But I'm sure that Peter-
that that boy, he could just
never be that person for me.

02:09:04.363 --> 02:09:06.280
[Knocking On Door]

02:09:06.365 --> 02:09:08.908
Maybe there's nothing
to be jealous about.

02:09:10.494 --> 02:09:12.870
Maybe I'm just
taking the place of his cat.

02:09:12.955 --> 02:09:14.872
Will you please let me
in my room?

02:09:14.957 --> 02:09:18.501
[Anne]
Just a minute,
dear, dear Mr. Dussel.

02:09:29.471 --> 02:09:32.265
Well, here I go...

02:09:32.349 --> 02:09:34.308
to run the gauntlet.

02:09:37.271 --> 02:09:39.313
Thank you so much.

02:09:47.531 --> 02:09:49.532
[Heel Snaps]

02:09:51.201 --> 02:09:53.619
Look at her.

02:09:53.704 --> 02:09:57.373
A lot of good it did me
to have a son.
I never see him.

02:09:59.209 --> 02:10:01.210
Just a minute, dear.

02:10:02.671 --> 02:10:06.382
I'd like to say
a few words to my son.
Do you mind?

02:10:06.467 --> 02:10:10.052
Peter, I do not want you staying
up till all hours tonight.

02:10:10.137 --> 02:10:12.180
You need your sleep.
You are a growing boy.

02:10:12.264 --> 02:10:15.850
Anne won't stay late.
She's going to bed
promptly at 9:00.

02:10:15.976 --> 02:10:19.812
Aren't you, Anne?
Yes, Mother. May we go now?

02:10:19.897 --> 02:10:22.190
[Mrs. Frank]
Listen for the chimes, dear.

02:10:42.127 --> 02:10:44.253
Aren't they impossible?

02:10:45.964 --> 02:10:49.091
Treating us as if
we're still in the nursery.

02:10:50.677 --> 02:10:53.679
Don't let it bother you.
It- It doesn't bother me.

02:10:57.768 --> 02:11:00.144
I suppose you can't
really blame them.

02:11:01.522 --> 02:11:04.273
They think back
to what they were like
at our age.

02:11:05.567 --> 02:11:09.278
They don't realize
how much more advanced
we are.

02:11:11.031 --> 02:11:13.032
[Explosions]

02:11:17.454 --> 02:11:20.122
[Sighs]

02:11:20.207 --> 02:11:22.959
Already I know
what I want to do.
Don't you?

02:11:24.127 --> 02:11:27.088
I want to be
a journalist
or something.

02:11:27.172 --> 02:11:29.173
I love to write.

02:11:30.592 --> 02:11:32.593
What do you want to do?

02:11:34.721 --> 02:11:36.722
I know
what I'd like right now.

02:11:36.807 --> 02:11:40.351
I'd like to make it to England,
get with the Free Dutch Forces
over there.

02:11:40.435 --> 02:11:43.563
Peter, you wouldn't
try a thing like that.

02:11:44.565 --> 02:11:47.984
You'd never make it.
I'd make it.

02:11:53.115 --> 02:11:55.866
Only a few of the hundreds
that try do.

02:11:57.661 --> 02:12:01.831
I know, but... I'd like to get in it
and- and hit back.

02:12:01.915 --> 02:12:05.209
To just sit here, it's not for me.

02:12:10.424 --> 02:12:12.717
You like Margot, don't you?

02:12:12.801 --> 02:12:14.719
Right from the start
you liked her.

02:12:14.803 --> 02:12:16.721
Liked her better than me.

02:12:18.557 --> 02:12:20.558
Oh, I don't know.

02:12:20.642 --> 02:12:22.560
It's all right.

02:12:22.644 --> 02:12:24.770
Everyone feels that way.

02:12:24.855 --> 02:12:26.981
Margot's so good.

02:12:27.065 --> 02:12:31.611
She's sweet and bright
and beautiful, and I'm not.

02:12:31.695 --> 02:12:33.613
I wouldn't say that.

02:12:33.697 --> 02:12:36.866
Oh, no, I'm not.
I know that.

02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:40.077
I know quite well
that I'm not a beauty.

02:12:40.162 --> 02:12:42.330
I never have been
and never shall be.

02:12:42.414 --> 02:12:45.166
I don't agree at all.

02:12:47.002 --> 02:12:49.587
I think you're pretty.

02:12:49.671 --> 02:12:51.714
That's not true.

02:12:51.798 --> 02:12:54.216
A-And another thing.

02:12:54.301 --> 02:12:57.470
You've changed.
From the first, I mean.

02:12:57.554 --> 02:12:59.597
I have?

02:13:01.725 --> 02:13:05.561
I used to think that
you were awful noisy.

02:13:05.646 --> 02:13:09.231
And what
do you think now, Peter?

02:13:09.316 --> 02:13:11.275
How have I changed?

02:13:12.819 --> 02:13:15.404
Well, you-

02:13:15.489 --> 02:13:17.406
You're quieter.

02:13:20.410 --> 02:13:22.912
I'm glad
you don’t just hate me.

02:13:23.997 --> 02:13:25.998
I never said that.

02:13:47.979 --> 02:13:51.774
I bet when you get out of here,
you'll never think of me again.

02:13:53.151 --> 02:13:55.236
That's crazy.

02:13:56.738 --> 02:13:58.823
When you get back
with all your friends,

02:13:58.907 --> 02:14:00.866
you're going to say,

02:14:00.951 --> 02:14:03.703
"Now, what did I ever see
in that Miss Quack-Quack?"

02:14:04.996 --> 02:14:08.499
I haven't got any friends.
Peter, of course you have.

02:14:09.668 --> 02:14:12.002
Everyone has friends.

02:14:12.087 --> 02:14:15.256
Not me. I don't want any.

02:14:15.340 --> 02:14:17.800
I get along fine without 'em.

02:14:20.637 --> 02:14:23.764
Does that mean you can
get along without me too?

02:14:25.934 --> 02:14:28.769
I think of myself
as your friend.

02:14:29.980 --> 02:14:32.857
No.

02:14:32.941 --> 02:14:35.651
If they were all like you,

02:14:35.736 --> 02:14:37.653
it'd be different.

02:14:37.738 --> 02:14:40.740
[Explosions]

02:14:48.331 --> 02:14:51.417
Peter-
Hmm?

02:14:51.501 --> 02:14:53.836
Did you ever kiss a girl?

02:14:57.841 --> 02:14:59.800
Yes.

02:14:59.885 --> 02:15:01.844
Once.

02:15:02.846 --> 02:15:05.139
Was she pretty?

02:15:05.223 --> 02:15:07.933
The girl you kissed.

02:15:08.018 --> 02:15:10.770
I don't know.
I was blindfolded.

02:15:10.854 --> 02:15:13.439
It was at a party.
One of those kissing games.

02:15:13.523 --> 02:15:15.441
Oh.

02:15:15.525 --> 02:15:18.110
I don't suppose that
really counts, does it?

02:15:20.655 --> 02:15:22.698
It didn't with me.

02:15:24.868 --> 02:15:26.869
I've been kissed twice.

02:15:29.539 --> 02:15:32.750
Once a man
I'd never seen before
kissed me on the cheek...

02:15:32.834 --> 02:15:34.960
when he picked me up
off the ice.

02:15:36.046 --> 02:15:38.047
I was crying.

02:15:39.716 --> 02:15:44.178
And the other was
a friend of Father's
who kissed my hand.

02:15:47.224 --> 02:15:50.226
You wouldn't say those
counted, would you?

02:15:51.812 --> 02:15:54.563
[Clears Throat]
I wouldn't say so.

02:15:54.648 --> 02:15:56.774
[Explosion]

02:16:07.577 --> 02:16:09.662
I know almost for certain...

02:16:09.746 --> 02:16:13.582
Margot would never
kiss anyone unless
she was engaged to them.

02:16:17.254 --> 02:16:20.923
And I'm sure too
that Mother never
touched a man before Father.

02:16:24.052 --> 02:16:26.011
But I don't know.

02:16:27.013 --> 02:16:29.265
Things are so different now.

02:16:31.101 --> 02:16:33.269
What do you think?

02:16:34.771 --> 02:16:37.189
Do you think a girl
shouldn't kiss anyone...

02:16:37.273 --> 02:16:39.941
except if she's engaged
or something?

02:16:43.947 --> 02:16:47.074
It's so hard
to try to think what to do,

02:16:48.576 --> 02:16:52.413
when here we are
with the whole world
falling around our ears.

02:16:53.915 --> 02:16:56.959
And you think,

02:16:57.043 --> 02:17:00.170
well, you don't know what's
going to happen tomorrow.

02:17:02.924 --> 02:17:04.842
What do you think?

02:17:06.093 --> 02:17:08.554
Well, uh,

02:17:08.638 --> 02:17:11.682
I suppose it-
it depends on the girl.

02:17:13.476 --> 02:17:17.313
With some, n-no matter
what they do, it's wrong.

02:17:18.356 --> 02:17:20.316
But others,

02:17:21.817 --> 02:17:24.570
it wouldn't necessarily
be wrong with them.

02:17:24.654 --> 02:17:26.822
[Bell Tolling]
I always thought that...

02:17:26.906 --> 02:17:28.824
when two people-

02:17:28.909 --> 02:17:31.035
I think I should go now.

02:17:32.370 --> 02:17:35.331
[Tolling Continues]
That's right.

02:17:38.501 --> 02:17:40.502
Good night.

02:17:45.508 --> 02:17:49.344
You won't let 'em
stop you from coming?
No.

02:17:50.347 --> 02:17:53.223
I might bring my diary.

02:17:53.308 --> 02:17:56.852
There are so many
things in it I want to
talk over with you.

02:17:56.937 --> 02:17:59.103
There's a lot about you.

02:17:59.189 --> 02:18:01.147
What kind of things?

02:18:03.817 --> 02:18:06.195
Well,

02:18:06.279 --> 02:18:08.572
I wouldn't want you
to see some of it.

02:18:09.574 --> 02:18:11.867
I thought you were nothing.

02:18:12.911 --> 02:18:15.245
Just the way
you thought about me.

02:18:17.665 --> 02:18:19.875
Did you change your mind,

02:18:21.085 --> 02:18:23.545
the way I changed my mind
about you?

02:18:25.340 --> 02:18:27.841
Well, you'll see.

02:19:47.589 --> 02:19:49.590
Good night, Annele.

02:19:54.846 --> 02:19:56.847
Good night, angel.
Good night.

02:20:14.115 --> 02:20:18.035
[Door Opens, Closes]

02:20:23.374 --> 02:20:25.334
Mm-hmm.

02:20:38.139 --> 02:20:40.766
[Anne Narrating]
Outside there is
a quiet excitement.

02:20:40.850 --> 02:20:42.059
Invasion fever is mounting
from day to day,

02:20:42.060 --> 02:20:43.936
Invasion fever is mounting
from day to day,

02:20:44.020 --> 02:20:47.022
and people talk of nothing else
but the hope of liberation.

02:20:48.024 --> 02:20:49.942
It had best come soon.

02:20:50.026 --> 02:20:52.486
We here have had bad news.

02:20:52.570 --> 02:20:56.490
The people from whom
Miep got our ration cards
have been arrested.

02:20:58.493 --> 02:21:01.745
Mr. Kraler is in the hospital.

02:21:01.830 --> 02:21:04.456
It seems he has ulcers.

02:21:04.541 --> 02:21:07.042
I'm afraid we are his ulcers.

02:21:08.253 --> 02:21:10.879

02:50:34.642 --> 02:50:38.228
[Anne Narrating]
And so it seems our stay here is over.

02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:42.733
They've given us just a moment
to get our things.

02:50:42.817 --> 02:50:44.943
We can each take a bag...

02:50:45.028 --> 02:50:47.029
and whatever it will hold
of clothing.

02:50:48.114 --> 02:50:50.866
Nothing else.
[Seagulls Squawking]

02:50:50.950 --> 02:50:52.993
So, dear... Diary,

02:50:54.996 --> 02:50:57.748
that means
I must leave you behind.

02:50:59.375 --> 02:51:01.919
Good-bye for a while.

02:51:03.046 --> 02:51:06.506
P.S.
Please, please, anyone,

02:51:07.884 --> 02:51:10.510
if you should find this diary,

02:51:10.595 --> 02:51:13.430
will you please
keep it safe for me,

02:51:13.514 --> 02:51:15.849
because someday I hope that-

02:51:19.771 --> 02:51:21.813
No more.

02:51:23.024 --> 02:51:25.943
I had gone to the country
to try to find food.

02:51:26.027 --> 02:51:28.987
When I got back,
the police were in the building.

02:51:29.072 --> 02:51:32.115
We made it our business
to learn how they knew.

02:51:32.200 --> 02:51:34.117
It was the thief
who told them.

02:51:34.202 --> 02:51:36.161
We know the thief.
He was-

02:51:36.245 --> 02:51:38.872
It seems strange to me now,

02:51:38.957 --> 02:51:43.293
but we were all so full of hope
in the camp here in Holland
where they first took us.

02:51:43.378 --> 02:51:45.796
The news of the war was good.

02:51:45.880 --> 02:51:48.256
The British and Americans
were sweeping through France.

02:51:48.341 --> 02:51:51.426
We felt sure they would
get to us in time to-

02:51:53.388 --> 02:51:55.389
But...

02:51:56.432 --> 02:51:58.392
in September
we were shipped to Poland.

02:51:58.476 --> 02:52:01.645
The men to one camp,
the women to another.

02:52:03.398 --> 02:52:07.693
From there...
they were sent to Belsen.

02:52:07.777 --> 02:52:10.404
I stayed in Auschwitz.

02:52:10.488 --> 02:52:13.782
In January we were freed,
the few of us who were left.

02:52:15.076 --> 02:52:17.244
The war was not yet over, no.

02:52:19.747 --> 02:52:23.000
It took us a long time
to get home.

02:52:23.084 --> 02:52:25.752
Each time the train
would stop, we'd...

02:52:25.837 --> 02:52:28.797
all get out, you know,
at a siding or a crossing, and...

02:52:28.881 --> 02:52:31.091
walk from group to group.

02:52:32.468 --> 02:52:34.594
"Where were you?"

02:52:34.679 --> 02:52:36.596
"Were you at Belsen?"

02:52:36.681 --> 02:52:38.890
"At Buchenwald?"

02:52:38.975 --> 02:52:41.852
"At Mauthausen? Where?"

02:52:41.936 --> 02:52:44.354
"Is it possible that
you ever knew my wife?"

02:52:44.439 --> 02:52:47.357
"Did you ever see
my husband, my son,

02:52:47.442 --> 02:52:49.443
my daughter?"

02:52:57.243 --> 02:53:00.537
That's how I found out
about my wife's death,

02:53:00.621 --> 02:53:04.041
Margot's, Van Daans',

02:53:04.125 --> 02:53:07.085
Peter, Dussel.

02:53:08.337 --> 02:53:10.338
But...

02:53:11.466 --> 02:53:13.425
Anne-

02:53:13.509 --> 02:53:15.635
I still hoped-

02:53:16.637 --> 02:53:21.016
Yesterday I was in Rotterdam.

02:53:21.100 --> 02:53:24.102
I met a woman there.

02:53:24.187 --> 02:53:27.397
She'd been in Belsen...
with Anne.

02:53:32.111 --> 02:53:34.112
I know now.

02:53:41.788 --> 02:53:43.789
[Seagulls Squawking]

02:53:48.503 --> 02:53:50.796
[Anne]
In spite of everything,

02:53:50.880 --> 02:53:55.425
I still believe that people
are really good at heart.

02:53:55.510 --> 02:53:58.220
She puts me to shame.

02:54:05.478 --> 02:54:07.521
