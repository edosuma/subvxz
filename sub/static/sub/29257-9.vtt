00:14.180 --> 00:15.598
Hello there.

00:17.892 --> 00:19.561
- Rian.
-Deet...

00:19.644 --> 00:22.480
- Is she awake?
- Deet wake.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.149
- Yes.
- Wake!

00:25.775 --> 00:26.693
Where...

00:27.402 --> 00:28.236
Where am I?

00:28.778 --> 00:30.780
Topside once again.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.450
How did I get here?

00:33.533 --> 00:36.494
I-- I remember the tree,

00:36.995 --> 00:39.247
-and then--
- You started glowing.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.459
You healed the Nurlocs and then...

00:44.919 --> 00:45.962
And then you fainted.

00:46.046 --> 00:49.007
Rian carried you to safety.

00:49.132 --> 00:53.470
-He must be very strong.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.015
And the Arathim?

00:57.724 --> 00:58.767
The other Grottans?

00:59.100 --> 00:59.976
All safe.

01:00.810 --> 01:01.644
Thanks to you.

01:01.728 --> 01:02.771
Hm...

01:03.480 --> 01:04.981
How are you feeling, Deet?

01:06.191 --> 01:07.567
I'm fine. Thank you.

01:08.651 --> 01:11.696
-"Fine," she says.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.991
Fine, perhaps she is.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.285
But also...

01:18.870 --> 01:20.121
changed.

01:22.957 --> 01:23.792
The Dual Glaive.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.628
It's still in the caves.
We have to go back--

01:26.711 --> 01:28.755
The Dual Glaive?
Is that what you're looking for?

01:28.838 --> 01:30.799
Why didn't you say so?

01:30.882 --> 01:32.133
- Uh...

01:32.217 --> 01:34.677
Just have to break off the wood...

01:34.761 --> 01:38.056
Been using it as a walking stick,

01:38.139 --> 01:39.599
keeping it hidden!

01:41.142 --> 01:42.102
Ah!

01:42.852 --> 01:43.812
Here you are!

01:44.729 --> 01:46.564
You had the Dual Glaive the whole time?

01:46.648 --> 01:49.609
Well, I didn't know
you were looking for it, did I?

01:50.068 --> 01:52.821
Careful with this. It's older than I am

01:53.404 --> 01:55.657
and twice as sharp.

02:18.429 --> 02:21.850
- Wait, no! No!

02:22.433 --> 02:25.186
Don't do this! Stop, Tavra!

02:25.270 --> 02:27.272
-This isn't you, Tavra. Stop!

02:27.814 --> 02:29.983
Tavra, please let me go.

02:30.191 --> 02:31.025
Tavra.

02:31.609 --> 02:33.361
I am the Ascendancy.

02:33.945 --> 02:36.322
Tavra! Tavra, no, don't... No.

02:40.201 --> 02:42.078
Exemplary!

02:42.495 --> 02:46.833
-These three are particularly feisty.

02:47.917 --> 02:50.879
We must hope they have the strength...

02:52.547 --> 02:56.801
...to bring skekMal back
from the precipice of death!

02:56.885 --> 02:57.844
If not,

02:58.011 --> 03:02.182
we will drain every last Gelfling
across Thra until the Hunter is restored.

03:02.265 --> 03:04.601
- Yes, Emperor.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.776
I am almost ready, sire.

03:19.908 --> 03:23.578
Oh, oh, oh! What if the Hunter dies?

03:23.661 --> 03:26.289
Then I will accept the somber task

03:26.372 --> 03:30.418
of honoring skekMal's treasures
with a proper display.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.796
You mean those disgusting trophies?

03:33.880 --> 03:36.841
Anything can be made beautiful.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.428
We should call the rest of the Skeksis
back to the castle.

03:40.511 --> 03:43.014
They must know what has happened!

03:43.389 --> 03:46.142
SkekSa and skekNa
will be useful in a fight.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.603
And skekUng is a strong warrior.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.897
And what of skekLi?

03:51.272 --> 03:57.237
Hmm! More Skeksis just mean more,
louder squabbling, yes?

03:57.320 --> 03:58.863
-Quiet, Chamberlain!

03:58.947 --> 04:01.115
This is all your fault!

04:01.699 --> 04:02.909
Hmm.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.828
Enough dawdling about! Get to it already!

04:05.912 --> 04:08.665
Squeeze these Gelfling, Scientist.

04:19.175 --> 04:21.761
The machine is primed, Emperor.

04:21.844 --> 04:23.221
I await your command.

04:23.304 --> 04:26.224
Very well, Scientist. Let's begin. Ha!

04:27.642 --> 04:29.102
Stop right there!

04:29.185 --> 04:31.104
Pusillanimous parasites!

04:34.274 --> 04:35.149
Seize her!

04:37.402 --> 04:38.569
Touch me

04:38.653 --> 04:41.239
and Thra will swallow you where you stand.

04:41.322 --> 04:45.243
I seem to recall
banishing you from my castle.

04:45.326 --> 04:49.622
Bah! I've come to pay my respects
to the Hunter.

04:52.959 --> 04:57.171
SkekMal was always the most beautiful
of you shriveled lot.

04:59.674 --> 05:03.011
Hm. But now, reeks of death.

05:03.094 --> 05:05.680
Blasphemy! We cannot die.

05:05.763 --> 05:09.100
You can, and this one will
any moment now...

05:09.726 --> 05:11.602
yes, without Aughra's help.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.646
We do not require your assistance.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.232
We have our own ways
of healing the Hunter.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.986
- Yes, I know. Essence, essence.
- Eh.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.947
But Gelfling essence
cannot restore the Hunter.

05:24.198 --> 05:27.618
What you need is essence of Thra itself.

05:28.202 --> 05:30.663
-And who is Thra? Huh?

05:31.789 --> 05:33.750
You are Thra.

05:33.833 --> 05:38.463
Correct. Only the essence of Aughra
can save your fallen Hunter now.

05:38.546 --> 05:40.506
Don't trust them!

05:41.507 --> 05:42.925
I offer a trade.

05:43.009 --> 05:46.304
-Hm?
-My life for the lives of these Gelfling

05:47.096 --> 05:49.098
and the ones locked in your foul cages.

05:49.932 --> 05:51.017
It's a trick.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.895
Strap her to the chair.
We will take her essence!

05:58.107 --> 05:59.400
All this time,

06:00.109 --> 06:01.778
protecting the Crystal,

06:02.236 --> 06:05.573
yet you remain ignorant
of its true nature.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.618
The Crystal cannot take my essence.

06:09.410 --> 06:10.912
I must give it...

06:12.914 --> 06:14.624
-willingly!
- No!

06:14.707 --> 06:20.380
You would give up your own life
for a few of these worthless Gelfling?

06:22.090 --> 06:23.049
Dimwits.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.177
We are all Thra.

06:27.553 --> 06:30.056
-All except you.

06:30.473 --> 06:33.017
You do not return to Thra when you perish.

06:33.267 --> 06:37.230
What happens to you
when your part of the song is done, hm?

06:37.563 --> 06:39.190
Never figured that out, did you?

06:39.357 --> 06:41.025
Tried, but failed.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.986
Maybe nothing is all that waits for you.

06:44.695 --> 06:47.907
So... make your choice.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.076
Do we have a deal,

06:50.785 --> 06:54.414
or will you sentence one of your own
to endless oblivion?

06:54.997 --> 06:56.457
Hm?

06:57.667 --> 06:59.877
-Hm...
-Hm.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.295
Oh, well.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.047
Aughra tried.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.008
-Stop!
-Hm?

07:10.221 --> 07:12.557
-Hm?
-I agree...

07:14.600 --> 07:16.602
to your terms.

07:17.645 --> 07:19.522
-Very good.

07:21.899 --> 07:23.025
Release these three!

07:25.445 --> 07:27.655
Gruenaks!

07:27.864 --> 07:29.866
-Yes... yes.

07:33.536 --> 07:36.205
Get these chains off me!

07:36.664 --> 07:39.000
Mother Aughra, please! Don't do this!

07:39.208 --> 07:41.377
I beg you. We're-- we're not worth it.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.963
Yes... you are.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.550
Free the rest of the Gelfling
and escort them all

07:47.633 --> 07:50.678
-safely from the castle.
-As you command.

07:52.013 --> 07:55.725
And you make sure every single one
of them dies before they get there.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.518
Of course, Emperor.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.689
Princess Tavra...

08:17.288 --> 08:19.832
What's happening?
What are we doing here?

08:19.916 --> 08:21.083
- Open up!
- Where am I?

08:21.167 --> 08:22.835
-Free your fellow Gelfling.
- Yes.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.003
Open up!

08:24.921 --> 08:28.674
-Maudra! Huh? What are you--
- Quickly, now.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.177
Go, Brea.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.888
-You have much to do.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.933
I can't! I...

08:37.016 --> 08:38.226
-Go.
-Please...

08:38.893 --> 08:40.770
-Go.
-I-- uh...

08:43.272 --> 08:44.982
Prepare the lab!

08:48.152 --> 08:50.363
- Oh, Brea.
- Seladon.

08:50.947 --> 08:54.033
I'm sorry about the gag, sisters,
but I had to make it look believable.

08:54.742 --> 08:55.952
Tavra?

08:56.494 --> 08:57.703
Is that really you?

08:58.246 --> 08:59.121
It's us.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.457
-But how?

09:02.250 --> 09:04.710
Rian and Deet took a truce
with the Ascendancy.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.672
Aughra ordered us to get you to safety.

09:08.005 --> 09:11.008
It's good to have you back.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.302
How do I know it's you

09:13.386 --> 09:15.179
and not that disgusting thing?

09:15.763 --> 09:17.557
You should hear what it says about you.

09:19.058 --> 09:20.685
Wait, was that a joke?

09:21.269 --> 09:22.603
I am the fun one.

09:24.313 --> 09:27.066
-Tavra! It is you! It is you!

09:27.400 --> 09:29.735
-Yes. Now...

09:30.528 --> 09:33.072
let's get out of this place. All of us.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.032
Come on, Brea.

09:35.157 --> 09:36.867
This way. Follow me.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.123
The catacombs.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.457
What's down there?

09:45.459 --> 09:46.502
Freedom.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.505
-Here comes the General!

09:51.674 --> 09:53.467
-What news?

09:54.093 --> 09:56.804
- How fares the Hunter?
-Did the essence work?

09:57.138 --> 09:59.015
The Hunter is alive.

10:00.933 --> 10:04.353
The Scientist is draining Aughra
of her essence even as we speak.

10:05.354 --> 10:07.690
Mother Aughra.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.401
-SkekLach, come with me.

10:10.484 --> 10:13.237
The Emperor has tasked us
with an important errand.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.989
Why me?

10:15.281 --> 10:18.951
Don't worry. This will be fun!

10:19.035 --> 10:20.369
Oh, I doubt that.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.080
The essence
of Mother Aughra would be powerful indeed.

10:23.164 --> 10:23.998
Hmm.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.131
Be strong.
We'll be out of this place soon enough.

10:32.214 --> 10:34.467
-Thank you, Maudra.
-Quickly now. Come on.

10:34.550 --> 10:35.551
That's it. Keep moving.

10:38.179 --> 10:41.057
If the Arathim and the Gelfling
have formed an alliance,

10:41.140 --> 10:43.434
then why is that creature
still on your face?

10:43.517 --> 10:46.604
We've been merged too long.
Our minds have become one.

10:46.937 --> 10:49.815
We are no longer sure where
one of us begins and the other ends.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.276
That's horrible.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.527
Not at all.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.613
The Arathim aren't monsters.

10:56.572 --> 10:57.907
They want the same thing.

10:58.824 --> 10:59.825
Justice.

10:59.909 --> 11:02.745
- Leaving so soon?

11:03.079 --> 11:04.622
-Oh, no.
- Skeksis!

11:08.125 --> 11:09.835
You were right.

11:09.919 --> 11:13.798
This will be fun!

11:13.881 --> 11:14.757
Aughra made a deal.

11:15.257 --> 11:17.093
<i>-</i>Out of our way!
-The deal has changed!

11:19.136 --> 11:20.346
- What?

11:20.429 --> 11:22.515
Indeed it has, General.

11:22.598 --> 11:25.851
What is this?
The Arathim swore loyalty to the Skeksis.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.729
-We gave you the Caves of Grot!
-A poison fly...

11:28.854 --> 11:30.815
...is no gift!

11:35.277 --> 11:38.406
The Gelfling must pay!

11:38.489 --> 11:40.533
Arathim, rise!

11:52.044 --> 11:55.715
Nasty Spitter.

11:59.593 --> 12:02.680
It got me!

12:02.763 --> 12:03.889
This way! Run!

12:03.973 --> 12:06.225
- It burns! Ow, ow!

12:11.188 --> 12:13.190
It burns!

12:13.274 --> 12:14.525
Tavra!

12:16.944 --> 12:18.571
I can't see!

12:18.696 --> 12:21.198
-We can't leave without Tavra.
-I'm with you.

12:21.282 --> 12:24.910
-Let's go.
-Ow! It's in my eyes!

12:26.454 --> 12:27.663
Come on, Brea!

12:27.997 --> 12:29.999
Ow, my eyes!

12:52.813 --> 12:53.647
No.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.025
No, I beg of you. Wait.

12:56.692 --> 12:59.320
We have waited long enough
for this moment.

12:59.820 --> 13:02.364
This is for the Arathim.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.325
For the All-Maudra!

13:07.161 --> 13:09.121
Leave... friend...

13:09.205 --> 13:11.081
-alone!

13:15.878 --> 13:17.922
Greetings, General.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.800
Not you. Not now!

13:22.176 --> 13:23.969
Do you not trust me?

13:24.220 --> 13:27.014
I saved General's life.

13:27.097 --> 13:28.849
So-- so that you<i> </i>

13:29.308 --> 13:32.186
can be the one
to deliver the killing blow?

13:32.269 --> 13:33.187
No.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.649
Skeksis squabble, yes.

13:36.732 --> 13:38.984
But are not enemy.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.281
-Gelfling are enemy!

13:45.115 --> 13:46.700
Ha! Hm...

13:47.284 --> 13:49.703
Here. I have a gift for you.

13:50.454 --> 13:52.248
What? What is that?

13:52.915 --> 13:56.001
Essence. All that remains,

13:56.627 --> 13:59.797
but enough to heal General.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.424
-I saved for myself,

14:03.008 --> 14:04.260
but now...

14:05.469 --> 14:06.929
for friend.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.556
Hmm?

14:23.404 --> 14:24.405
It's working.

14:29.076 --> 14:31.036
-It's working!
-Ah!

14:31.120 --> 14:32.705
I feel strong!

14:32.788 --> 14:35.791
I misjudged you, Chamberlain.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.753
-Am used to it. Now, come.
-Mm! Yes!

14:40.254 --> 14:41.589
-Busy. Busy!
- Yes.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.966
-Much to do.
-Much to do!

14:44.049 --> 14:47.344
Have plan that General will like, yes?

14:47.469 --> 14:48.846
Hmm...

14:49.430 --> 14:52.516
Do you see her? Tavra!

14:52.600 --> 14:53.851
Where is she?

14:53.934 --> 14:55.686
Tavra!

14:55.769 --> 14:57.688
Oh! Sister! Sister!

14:58.439 --> 15:01.066
-We're here.
-Help... us...

15:02.401 --> 15:03.360
Here...

15:03.444 --> 15:05.988
-Give me your arm.
-Yes, yes. Can you stand?

15:06.071 --> 15:08.574
- Careful. Careful.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.075
-Oh!
- Good.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.827
-We've got you now.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.079
That's it. Hold on.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.884
Both halves

15:26.967 --> 15:29.386
are not long for Thra.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.181
Oh.

15:34.308 --> 15:37.478
I wonder... in the next place...

15:37.603 --> 15:39.855
will we be joined once again?

15:40.064 --> 15:41.190
Hm.

15:41.857 --> 15:43.692
Or rend further...

15:45.361 --> 15:46.654
asunder.

15:46.737 --> 15:48.489
-Huh.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.788
-Are you proud?
-Huh?

15:55.871 --> 15:59.708
To build a machine
that will be the death of Aughra?

16:00.250 --> 16:04.964
Not as proud as Mother Aughra
throwing her life away

16:05.047 --> 16:07.716
in a desperate bid for redemption.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.803
Hm, it did not have to end this way
between us.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.888
We were friends once.

16:17.893 --> 16:19.478
Another world.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.522
Another time.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.614
Good. That will do.

16:34.910 --> 16:39.707
Now we shall see
how powerful Aughra truly is.

16:47.756 --> 16:50.968
Oo! Now, well, spinning chairs, now.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.387
- Yes.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.142
Isn't this fancy?

17:04.732 --> 17:07.609
-No. No, no!
- Yes, yes!

17:12.364 --> 17:14.992
-No!

17:16.827 --> 17:21.248
-Barely a tickle.
- Yes!

17:23.042 --> 17:24.710
- Yes!

17:25.627 --> 17:28.088
That's it, yes!

17:34.053 --> 17:35.804
Aughra...

17:36.430 --> 17:38.432
No!

17:44.521 --> 17:45.606
Huh?

17:47.691 --> 17:49.943
Where is it? Where is the essence
I was promised?

17:53.363 --> 17:56.366
She does not drain! She has deceived us!

17:56.492 --> 17:57.951
Fix this, Scientist!

17:58.035 --> 17:59.578
-Uh...
- Increase the power!

18:09.671 --> 18:10.923
Ah!

18:11.090 --> 18:12.966
I am stupefied, Emperor.

18:13.050 --> 18:17.262
-She withers away, but does not give.
- Bah!

18:17.346 --> 18:18.472
Infernal hag!

18:18.555 --> 18:20.516
- Agh!

18:20.808 --> 18:21.767
Liar!

18:22.643 --> 18:23.560
Cheat!

18:24.019 --> 18:27.439
I gave you your Gelfling,
now where is my essence?

18:27.856 --> 18:30.734
You... are doomed.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.904
You and all your kind.

18:34.404 --> 18:36.615
Parasites, thieves.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.200
In the end...

18:39.326 --> 18:41.495
you are nothing...

18:43.789 --> 18:45.999
but... dust!

18:47.084 --> 18:50.212
I... will never...

18:50.295 --> 18:52.965
be... dust!

19:03.100 --> 19:05.060
Emperor, behold!

19:05.144 --> 19:07.229
Essence!

19:22.077 --> 19:23.036
Oh!

19:26.206 --> 19:28.584
Yes!

19:29.251 --> 19:31.378
There it is! I knew it.

19:31.461 --> 19:32.880
Yes!

19:40.095 --> 19:42.097
- It's too much!

19:42.389 --> 19:45.642
Shut it down! Shut it down!

19:52.065 --> 19:53.275
- What?

19:54.776 --> 19:56.111
Well, did it work?

20:01.950 --> 20:03.327
Did it, huh?

20:06.914 --> 20:08.498
- Archer?

20:12.377 --> 20:13.420
Hm.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.380
The Hunter...

20:16.423 --> 20:17.633
is gone.

20:23.597 --> 20:25.724
-Dead?

20:26.475 --> 20:27.517
No!

20:29.353 --> 20:31.063
No! No!

20:31.146 --> 20:34.358
No!

20:34.900 --> 20:38.570
-We can not die!

20:40.030 --> 20:42.741
Agh!

20:48.580 --> 20:51.875
I... cannot die.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.304
-Don't look back. Quickly now.

21:05.180 --> 21:07.891
Maudra Fara, our sister is hurt.

21:08.684 --> 21:09.768
Maurdra Fara.

21:09.851 --> 21:11.728
No. We can't stop now.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.106
Can we at least slow down?

21:15.065 --> 21:15.941
Halt.

21:16.733 --> 21:19.152
Someone's coming. Stand ready.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.946
What is it? Another Spitter?

21:23.532 --> 21:25.534
- No!

21:25.617 --> 21:26.743
Kylan!

21:27.244 --> 21:29.371
-You scared us.
-Scared you?

21:29.705 --> 21:32.457
-I practically died of fright.
-What are you doing here?

21:34.418 --> 21:36.086
I've just come from Sami Thicket.

21:36.670 --> 21:40.841
I tried to rally the Spritons
to our cause, but... they wouldn't listen.

21:41.341 --> 21:42.551
It's not your fault.

21:43.051 --> 21:46.221
Maudra Mira loves the Skeksis
almost as much as she fears them.

21:48.724 --> 21:52.644
- Tavra.
- I-- I can't go on.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.855
Hold on. You need to sit down.

21:55.188 --> 21:58.233
There's no time.
We must press on to Stone-in-the-Wood.

21:59.776 --> 22:00.819
Maudra Fara,

22:01.528 --> 22:05.574
Gelfling have always been strongest
when we've stood together.

22:06.658 --> 22:07.826
Not apart.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.329
Very well.

22:10.954 --> 22:12.122
We camp here tonight.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.543
Come on. We've got you.

22:16.626 --> 22:18.462
Easy, good.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.464
You can rest now, right over here.

22:20.547 --> 22:22.466
- Good.That's it.
- We've got you, Tavra.

22:22.549 --> 22:23.800
That's right, sister.

22:23.884 --> 22:24.968
- Everything's going...
-Good.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.136
...to be alright now, Tavra.

22:26.219 --> 22:27.179
Sit.

22:30.515 --> 22:34.102
I know you must take the Dual Glaive,

22:34.728 --> 22:37.022
but it did make a fine cane.

22:37.397 --> 22:39.191
Oh, I'll miss that cane.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.152
What now?
What do we do with the Dual Glaive?

22:42.277 --> 22:45.781
Find the other half
to unlock it's true power!

22:46.156 --> 22:47.240
Well, where's the rest?

22:47.741 --> 22:51.328
Stone-in-the-Wood, I imagine,
where I left it 30 trine past.

22:52.079 --> 22:55.332
This was in the Arathim Wars.

22:55.499 --> 22:58.877
I was tasked with delivering it
to the Stonewood Maudra

22:58.960 --> 23:00.796
in their time of need.

23:00.962 --> 23:03.548
Ah, the Battle of Stone-in-the-Wood.

23:04.091 --> 23:05.759
I remember the stories.

23:06.259 --> 23:08.512
Oh. Nasty business.

23:09.471 --> 23:12.557
Unfortunately, I arrived too late.

23:13.433 --> 23:15.852
The Maudra had already fallen.

23:15.936 --> 23:18.188
All seemed lost...

23:19.022 --> 23:22.234
until a young soldier named Ordon...

23:22.317 --> 23:24.569
-Hm?
-took up the Dual Glaive.

23:24.694 --> 23:25.821
My father?

23:26.863 --> 23:28.657
See for yourself.

23:37.666 --> 23:41.128
<i>The sword possesses strange powers.</i>

23:41.211 --> 23:45.298
<i>After he won the battle,</i>
<i>Ordon split it in two.</i>

23:45.424 --> 23:49.678
<i>Half he hid,</i>
<i>the other half he entrusted to me.</i>

23:57.561 --> 23:59.563
My father wielded this blade.

23:59.646 --> 24:02.941
He never gave up. Not ever.

24:03.608 --> 24:05.026
And neither will we.

24:07.779 --> 24:09.614
We need to get to Stone-in-the-Wood.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.159
-Fast.
- Fast?

24:12.242 --> 24:15.328
Oh, I may be able to help.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.627
- Oh!

24:23.044 --> 24:24.713
Look! Pretty!

24:30.343 --> 24:31.344
A Landstrider!

24:33.555 --> 24:35.223
You can call them?

24:35.390 --> 24:41.980
I still remember a trick or two
from my trine overground.

24:45.859 --> 24:48.153
I think he's offering us a ride.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.573
Whoa! Whoa.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.243
Ready?

24:56.453 --> 24:59.581
I've never ridden a Landstrider before.

24:59.873 --> 25:02.334
Huh, I have a feeling you'll like it.

25:04.711 --> 25:05.629
Watch your step.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.506
Here.

25:14.679 --> 25:15.847
Hold on.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.684
-Yah!
- Fare well, Deet!

25:20.810 --> 25:22.229
To Stone-in-the-Wood!

25:32.447 --> 25:33.907
Yah! Hi-yah!

25:38.411 --> 25:39.621
Whoo!

25:45.001 --> 25:46.378
She looks worse.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.381
She's strong.

25:50.173 --> 25:51.508
She'll make it.

25:54.636 --> 25:57.347
Here. Lay down, sister.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.975
I've got you, Tavra.

26:03.937 --> 26:06.398
-It should have been me.

26:07.107 --> 26:09.067
Seladon, no.

26:10.026 --> 26:12.904
Aughra told me
I was making a terrible mistake.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.199
But, no, I wouldn't listen.

26:18.159 --> 26:20.245
This is my price to pay,

26:20.787 --> 26:21.955
not hers.

26:23.331 --> 26:24.916
I'm so sorry.

26:27.043 --> 26:28.795
-For everything.

26:31.464 --> 26:34.634
-Tavra? Tavra?

26:36.219 --> 26:38.388
We're here. You're not alone.

26:40.223 --> 26:41.808
We were never alone.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.603
Even death...

26:46.396 --> 26:49.482
cannot break the bonds of sisterhood.

26:49.566 --> 26:51.776
Don't talk, just rest.

26:52.277 --> 26:53.194
We wish...

26:54.571 --> 26:56.156
you could see each other...

26:57.699 --> 26:58.992
the way I do.

26:59.951 --> 27:01.161
You're so...

27:05.415 --> 27:06.541
beautiful.

27:18.428 --> 27:20.138
-Tavra!

27:25.352 --> 27:26.770
Our sister is gone.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.814
We will return her to Thra.

27:32.025 --> 27:32.942
Together.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.408
-I love you.
-I love you, Seladon.

28:34.921 --> 28:37.173
You summoned me, Emperor?

28:40.009 --> 28:41.344
SkekMal...

28:42.470 --> 28:43.596
is dead.<i> </i>

28:45.014 --> 28:46.558
Oh...

28:47.684 --> 28:49.227
Preparations must be made...

28:50.395 --> 28:51.521
for the body.

28:51.730 --> 28:55.024
Huh? But there is no rite,

28:55.817 --> 28:57.652
no ceremony for such a thing.

28:58.945 --> 29:02.365
No Skeksis has died in a thousand trine.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.117
Not since...

29:05.160 --> 29:06.119
the beginning.

29:08.037 --> 29:09.330
We were betrayed.

29:09.622 --> 29:13.668
The Arathim have turned
against us and sided with the Gelfling.

29:13.752 --> 29:17.756
Yeah. It's a good thing I was there

29:17.839 --> 29:22.510
to teach those disgusting critters
a lesson.

29:25.638 --> 29:29.225
More grave news.

29:29.309 --> 29:32.729
All is not lost, Emperor.
The Chamberlain has a plan.

29:32.812 --> 29:36.691
I thought you'd had enough
of the Chamberlain's plans, General.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.235
-SkekSil saved my life.

29:39.319 --> 29:41.821
-Huh?
- Our enemies join against us.

29:42.155 --> 29:45.158
We must put our squabbles aside
for the good of all Skeksis.

29:45.658 --> 29:47.285
-Hm?

29:51.873 --> 29:54.125
General was right.

29:54.542 --> 29:57.420
Gelfling must be crushed.

29:57.629 --> 30:02.509
Gelfling are plague upon Thra,
upon Skeksis.

30:02.842 --> 30:05.804
Can be no peace while Gelfling live.

30:06.012 --> 30:08.014
Must be war.

30:08.932 --> 30:12.310
Wars require soldiers.
We have lost the Arathim.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.939
Yes, because Skeksis have been too kind.

30:16.356 --> 30:19.734
Give Gelfling everything, they want more.

30:20.068 --> 30:23.488
Think loyalty can be bought
or demanded.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.031
But not true.

30:25.365 --> 30:27.367
Can only be built.

30:27.951 --> 30:32.330
-And so I bring friend General a plan.

30:34.582 --> 30:38.419
Sire, imagine an army
of unstoppable soldiers,

30:38.837 --> 30:40.421
engineered to be loyal.

30:40.505 --> 30:41.464
Ah...

30:41.714 --> 30:43.424
Could you build such a thing?

30:43.508 --> 30:46.928
Ah, I relish such a challenge, Emperor.

30:47.220 --> 30:51.182
But... one cannot make something
from nothing.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.356
Here is your something.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.359
Arathim...

31:01.943 --> 31:04.988
reanimated by Scientist's machines.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.991
-Made into soulless...

31:08.074 --> 31:11.536
fearless instruments of death.

31:13.413 --> 31:16.791
It might be possible
to surgically graft the cadavers

31:17.375 --> 31:20.169
into a new, larger specimen.

31:20.253 --> 31:21.629
Giant Arathim.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.090
Mm... Very good.

31:28.052 --> 31:29.637
Build my army!

31:30.430 --> 31:32.640
Every resource shall be yours.

31:32.932 --> 31:34.934
Yes, Emperor.

31:36.603 --> 31:38.646
-And, Chamberlain...
-Mm?

31:38.730 --> 31:40.607
you have earned your place again

31:41.065 --> 31:42.442
at our table.

31:43.276 --> 31:47.030
I live merely to serve, Emperor.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.406
Mm...

31:54.412 --> 31:55.580
The Hunter...

31:57.540 --> 31:58.958
will not be buried...

31:59.876 --> 32:04.130
-or burnt like some common carcass. No!

32:05.256 --> 32:07.508
The Hunter will be clad
in our finest armor...

32:08.509 --> 32:13.431
...and placed in our throne room
so that skekMal might rule by our side...

32:14.682 --> 32:15.975
...forever!

32:16.059 --> 32:18.394
Forever!

32:18.478 --> 32:21.648
- Hail to the Emperor!
- Hail to the Emperor!

32:23.399 --> 32:25.401
Yes, yes!

32:25.485 --> 32:27.278
Good, good!

32:30.949 --> 32:32.408
You're right.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.285
- I do like it!

32:34.744 --> 32:36.913
- Whoo!
- Yah! Yah!

32:38.498 --> 32:40.124
- Woo-hoo!

32:49.592 --> 32:51.636
Careful, you fool.

32:51.719 --> 32:55.014
-I am being careful.

32:55.098 --> 32:56.432
Ah!

32:56.516 --> 32:59.686
Slather it on.
Yes, we'll slather it on. Ha!

32:59.769 --> 33:04.232
Life is my paint! Death is my canvas.

33:04.315 --> 33:05.733
Life!

33:05.817 --> 33:07.485
Alright, raise him!

33:12.323 --> 33:14.826
Let's see him! Alright, stop!

33:15.201 --> 33:16.369
One more thing.

33:17.203 --> 33:19.205
Make way. Make way!

33:19.580 --> 33:21.165
- Make way!

33:21.249 --> 33:22.500
- Genius.
- What?

33:22.583 --> 33:23.751
Let's see.

33:28.631 --> 33:30.758
- Oh, so nice!
- A fitting tribute!

33:32.677 --> 33:34.012
Yes!

33:35.304 --> 33:37.932
- Yes! Yes!

33:38.391 --> 33:40.935
The Hunter returns!

33:44.856 --> 33:46.566
- That's it. Easy!

33:47.275 --> 33:48.818
Mind your step.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.696
- That's it.

33:59.328 --> 34:00.621
Look.

34:02.498 --> 34:06.127
What-- What happened to all the Gelfling?

34:11.883 --> 34:12.800
They're all...

34:13.676 --> 34:14.510
gone.

34:15.344 --> 34:16.512
We'll find them.

34:17.305 --> 34:18.347
I promise.

34:21.893 --> 34:24.854
Thank you for bearing us upon your back,
noble Landstrider.

34:37.909 --> 34:38.868
That's it.

34:39.952 --> 34:41.287
That's the crucible.

34:42.121 --> 34:43.247
Is the Glaive in there?

34:47.835 --> 34:49.212
Once a battle is done...

34:50.171 --> 34:53.257
the warriors of Stone-in-the-Wood
place their weapons in the forge

34:53.341 --> 34:55.843
in the hope
that we'll never need them again.

35:03.643 --> 35:04.519
Here.

35:06.854 --> 35:07.730
Thank you.

35:36.259 --> 35:37.969
I see it. There!

35:38.344 --> 35:40.054
The other half of the Dual Glaive.

35:47.728 --> 35:49.730
-Careful!

35:49.856 --> 35:51.315
You'll burn yourself.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.067
It's not even warm.

36:05.371 --> 36:08.124
-Do you hear...

36:30.980 --> 36:34.233
It seems like the Glaive is now one!

36:34.984 --> 36:36.569
- Look!

36:39.739 --> 36:41.949
-What's happening?

36:42.033 --> 36:43.409
What's happening?

36:43.492 --> 36:46.162
- Careful.
- It doesn't burn.

36:46.245 --> 36:47.705
What does this mean?

37:08.643 --> 37:12.188
The sky! It's on fire!

37:12.730 --> 37:15.274
How is this possible?

37:25.451 --> 37:27.453
Oh...

37:27.954 --> 37:30.581
They're uniting against us.

37:42.218 --> 37:46.806
- What is it?
-Emperor, you must see.

37:49.892 --> 37:51.143
What's that sound?

37:51.227 --> 37:52.436
- What?

37:54.313 --> 37:55.439
What?

37:56.482 --> 37:57.441
Huh?

37:57.608 --> 37:59.235
The Crystal calls!

37:59.318 --> 38:01.821
To the Crystal Chamber!

38:01.904 --> 38:04.532
To the Crystal Chamber!

38:06.701 --> 38:08.327
Could this day get any worse?

38:09.578 --> 38:10.997
Out of my way.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.257
- <i>How is this possible?</i>
- Is someone there?

38:21.340 --> 38:22.967
- <i>It might be a trick.</i>
- <i>Is it the Skeksis?</i>

38:23.301 --> 38:24.343
Brea?

38:25.970 --> 38:27.221
- Papa, look.
- <i>Is that you?</i>

38:28.723 --> 38:30.057
Can you hear me?

38:30.933 --> 38:31.892
Rian?

38:31.976 --> 38:34.979
<i> You escaped the Hunter?</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

38:35.479 --> 38:36.939
I'm here with Maudra Fara...

38:37.481 --> 38:38.524
and Seladon.

38:40.818 --> 38:43.446
<i> Well, Gurjin is here too,</i>
<i>in case you were wondering.</i>

38:43.904 --> 38:44.864
Gurjin!

38:45.656 --> 38:46.699
Where are you?

38:46.866 --> 38:49.660
<i> Me and my sister are back</i>
<i>with our clan at the Great Smerth.</i>

38:52.038 --> 38:52.955
Yes!

38:53.539 --> 38:58.711
Every fire across Thra
carries your message, Rian.

38:59.462 --> 39:01.881
-Every Gelfling is listening.

39:02.214 --> 39:04.759
So speak true!

39:07.261 --> 39:08.304
What should I say?

39:08.888 --> 39:10.765
Whatever is in your heart.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.356
<i>Gelfling...</i>

39:35.247 --> 39:36.290
<i>The Skeksis... </i>

39:36.999 --> 39:38.209
<i>deceived us.</i>

39:39.335 --> 39:42.254
- Voices!
- <i>Turned clan against clan.</i>

39:47.301 --> 39:48.969
<i>Murdered our All-Maudra. </i>

39:51.972 --> 39:53.265
Drained our loved ones.<i> </i>

39:55.267 --> 39:57.269
Unleashed the Darkening upon our world.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.106
And now everyone

40:00.648 --> 40:01.774
and everything...

40:02.608 --> 40:03.609
is at risk.

40:06.195 --> 40:08.280
<i>What was once unthinkable...</i>

40:09.198 --> 40:11.325
<i>has become inevitable.</i>

40:12.535 --> 40:13.619
<i>Rebellion.</i>

40:15.621 --> 40:16.622
This weapon...

40:17.665 --> 40:19.667
<i>-the Dual Glaive...</i>
- What?

40:19.750 --> 40:22.503
<i>was forged by two halves of a great being,</i>

40:23.170 --> 40:26.257
<i>and it has been foretold</i>
<i>to end Skeksis power.</i>

40:26.340 --> 40:31.470
The Dual Glaive!
They have the Dual Glaive!

40:31.554 --> 40:32.555
It is now...

40:33.431 --> 40:35.057
in Gelfling hands.

40:36.225 --> 40:39.895
<i> The Skeksis have sown distrust</i>
<i>amongst us for a thousand trine. Why?</i>

40:40.604 --> 40:44.108
<i>Because they fear what would happen</i>
<i>if we were united.</i>

40:44.191 --> 40:46.777
- <i>They were right to be afraid.</i>

40:49.572 --> 40:50.489
Join me

40:51.157 --> 40:52.616
at Stone-in-the-Wood.

40:53.242 --> 40:54.118
Here...

40:55.161 --> 40:56.745
we will make our stand.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.081
Not as many...

41:00.291 --> 41:02.126
<i>but as one!</i>

41:02.418 --> 41:05.129
- <i>As one!</i>

41:12.094 --> 41:13.554
That's enough!

41:17.850 --> 41:19.560
<i>Silence!</i>

41:23.397 --> 41:26.692
<i>Your pathetic rebellion</i>
<i>can only end in ruin!</i>

41:26.775 --> 41:28.360
Then why do you tremble?

41:28.444 --> 41:31.906
<i>Disrespectful peon!</i>
<i>Your lives are but a speck</i>

41:31.989 --> 41:33.491
<i>waiting to be swept away.</i>

41:33.574 --> 41:36.368
<i>Be assured,</i>
<i>any Gelfling that stand with you in battle</i>

41:36.452 --> 41:38.913
<i>will join you in the grave.</i>

41:38.996 --> 41:40.289
Bring your weapons!

41:41.123 --> 41:42.708
Bring your Skeksis

41:43.083 --> 41:45.711
and meet your destiny!

41:54.595 --> 41:57.806
He had the Heretic's Dual Glaive.

41:57.890 --> 42:00.059
Well, how did he obtain it?

42:00.434 --> 42:02.853
Surely even the Heretic would not...

42:03.896 --> 42:05.022
could not...

42:05.105 --> 42:07.107
SkekGra has betrayed us before.

42:07.608 --> 42:08.734
Why not again?

42:09.318 --> 42:10.611
Cowards!

42:12.196 --> 42:14.240
Let the chattel have their toy.

42:14.323 --> 42:17.618
Let them think
they stand a chance against us.

42:17.910 --> 42:21.288
But hear me, Lords of the Crystal,

42:21.372 --> 42:22.581
Regents of Thra,

42:22.665 --> 42:25.376
-all-powerful Skeksis.
- Yes!

42:25.459 --> 42:27.670
At dawn, we descend

42:27.753 --> 42:30.464
-on their pitiful village.
- Yes!

42:31.298 --> 42:35.761
We will crush their nascent rebellion
before it takes root,

42:35.844 --> 42:39.181
-grind these defiant Gelfling to dust...

42:39.265 --> 42:41.517
destroy the Dual Glaive,

42:41.600 --> 42:44.186
and feast upon their essence!

43:04.290 --> 43:05.291
But...

43:05.624 --> 43:07.293
do you think all Gelfling heard you?

43:09.169 --> 43:10.087
Yes.

43:12.047 --> 43:13.299
But will they come?
