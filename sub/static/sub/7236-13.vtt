00:01.710 --> 00:04.448
<i>Accessing archive data...</i>

00:04.449 --> 00:05.816
Hello, Able.

00:05.849 --> 00:08.103
<i>Able is visited by
an old acquaintance...</i>

00:08.135 --> 00:11.846
- I know about Beck.
- Beck's training is essential.

00:11.880 --> 00:14.034
- To what end?
- He knows the stakes.

00:14.068 --> 00:18.075
<i>...while Tron is visited
by a guilty conscience.</i>

00:18.110 --> 00:21.624
A long time ago
I misjudged someone.

00:21.657 --> 00:24.074
- Who are you?!
- I'm a friend.

00:24.108 --> 00:27.571
I let friendship cloud judgment,

00:27.572 --> 00:30.835
and paid a... heavy price.

00:33.654 --> 00:37.628
<i>Able: Beck, I need you to leave
Argon and head straight to Gallium.</i>

00:37.662 --> 00:39.650
<i>There's a pick-up I need you to make.</i>

00:39.684 --> 00:42.633
<i>Beck: Gallium? But that's
way out in the outlands.</i>

00:42.667 --> 00:46.676
<i>Well, then stop wasting time
arguing. Stick to the road,</i>

00:46.710 --> 00:48.665
<i>and you won't have any trouble.</i>

00:51.514 --> 00:53.635
Come on, come on, come on!

01:06.593 --> 01:07.752
Uhh!

01:12.756 --> 01:15.307
Great.

01:15.341 --> 01:18.621
<i>Stranger: The road's closed up ahead.
Nothing to do but wait out the storm.</i>

01:18.655 --> 01:21.372
<i>Beck: Not an option.
I gotta get to Gallium.</i>

01:21.406 --> 01:24.256
Gallium? There's no way you're
getting through that storm.

01:24.289 --> 01:27.336
Fine. Then I'll go around it.

01:27.370 --> 01:29.358
Yeah, right.

01:49.541 --> 01:52.455
Hmm.
So much for the shortcut.

01:53.483 --> 01:55.273
Or not.

02:00.310 --> 02:01.302
Whoa.

02:07.169 --> 02:08.197
Uhh!

02:29.261 --> 02:38.776
<b>S01E13 - The Stranger</b>

02:45.935 --> 02:47.988
Okay...

02:48.023 --> 02:50.805
I'm pretty certain this isn't Gallium.

03:16.522 --> 03:18.344
Ahh! Uhh!

03:23.448 --> 03:25.369
Hey... hey!

03:42.004 --> 03:46.016
- No word from Beck?
- Beck? Uh-uh. Why?

03:46.050 --> 03:48.103
He should have been
back from Gallium by now.

03:48.137 --> 03:51.085
No way it should have
taken it this long.

03:51.119 --> 03:54.795
- Unless...
- Unless what?

03:55.858 --> 03:57.779
Unless what?!

03:57.812 --> 03:59.999
No one ever tells me anything.

04:04.640 --> 04:07.554
Tron.

04:07.588 --> 04:10.703
Shouldn't you be back in that
geriatric chamber of yours?

04:10.737 --> 04:13.851
- I'm looking for Beck.
- He's not here.

04:13.885 --> 04:16.635
But I'll let him know you stopped by.

04:16.668 --> 04:20.577
Something's happening in Pergos.
Something troublesome.

04:20.612 --> 04:22.798
And you just can't
leave it alone, can you?

04:22.832 --> 04:26.477
I intercepted the data feed,
and it's encrypted.

04:26.511 --> 04:27.802
So that's a "no".

04:27.837 --> 04:30.651
Somebody doesn't want anyone
to see what they're up to.

04:30.685 --> 04:33.569
- Who's that?
- Dyson.

04:33.603 --> 04:36.320
He's someone you better
hope you never have to meet.

04:36.354 --> 04:38.706
You have friends everywhere,
don't you?

04:40.330 --> 04:42.484
I need to see Beck
as soon as he's back.

04:42.517 --> 04:44.604
Make sure he gets the message.

04:44.637 --> 04:47.553
Wait! You're not send him up
against this Dyson, are you?

04:47.587 --> 04:51.496
- It's not your concern.
- Beck is my concern!

04:51.530 --> 04:54.380
So I'll go instead of him.

04:54.414 --> 04:58.322
I'll find out what
Dyson's doing in Pergos.

04:59.485 --> 05:02.299
- Hmm...
- You're running out of time.

05:05.084 --> 05:07.403
I'm running out of patience.

05:26.128 --> 05:28.976
<i>Easy there.</i>

05:33.021 --> 05:35.868
<i>Apologies for the rude welcome.</i>

05:35.903 --> 05:38.885
Where... am I?

05:38.919 --> 05:40.905
<i>You're safe.</i>

05:40.939 --> 05:44.055
<i>You stumbled in what some
would call "compressed space."</i>

05:44.088 --> 05:47.965
<i>Not quite off the Grid, but close.</i>

05:47.999 --> 05:50.152
<i>I just call it home.</i>

05:51.909 --> 05:56.812
It's... nice.
Inviting.

05:56.846 --> 05:59.928
Speaking of home, I need
to find a way back to mine,

05:59.962 --> 06:02.082
so...
sorry for trespassing

06:02.117 --> 06:05.660
and breaching your
security system.

06:05.694 --> 06:08.710
<i>You're leaving?
Now?</i>

06:08.743 --> 06:12.984
<i>Not a good idea.
That nasty storm is right on top of us.</i>

06:20.938 --> 06:22.926
Trust me, I can handle it.

06:22.960 --> 06:25.809
Just point me to the exit
and I'll be on my way.

06:25.843 --> 06:28.559
<i>I don't think you understand.</i>

06:29.621 --> 06:32.536
<i>I'm not asking you to stay...</i>

06:32.571 --> 06:34.888
<i>I'm insisting, Beck.</i>

06:34.924 --> 06:36.909
How did you know my name?

06:36.943 --> 06:40.589
<i>I know a lot more
than your name, Beck.</i>

06:40.624 --> 06:43.009
Or would you rather I call you...

06:43.010 --> 06:43.803
the Renegade?

06:54.082 --> 06:57.063
Don't worry.
Your disc is safe...

06:57.098 --> 07:00.842
along with all of your
other juicy little secrets.

07:00.876 --> 07:03.857
So you know... everything.

07:05.748 --> 07:08.861
Relax.
Who am I gonna tell down here?

07:10.950 --> 07:15.754
Besides, we're on the same team,
you and me. We're the good guys.

07:15.788 --> 07:18.605
You expect me to just
take your word for it?

07:18.639 --> 07:20.594
Yeah. But...

07:20.628 --> 07:24.669
I guess you got your
reasons for being discreet.

07:26.625 --> 07:29.408
Come on. There's something
I want to show you.

07:37.594 --> 07:39.714
Hmm.
I'm right behind you.

07:49.457 --> 07:50.616
Whoa!

08:14.311 --> 08:16.000
<i>Announcement: All incoming programs</i>

08:16.034 --> 08:19.083
<i>please proceed to main elevator
for service assignments.</i>

08:19.116 --> 08:22.131
<i>Let's go, let's go.
Move it, programs.</i>

08:22.166 --> 08:23.390
<i>We got work to do.</i>

08:26.209 --> 08:27.400
I said move it!

08:40.259 --> 08:42.246
All right, listen up, programs.

08:42.280 --> 08:46.289
<i>You've been assigned to group 7-4,
system maintenance and inspection.</i>

08:46.323 --> 08:50.829
<i>Upon exiting this elevator,
do not fraternize, socialize,</i>

08:50.862 --> 08:53.943
<i>do not even make visual contact
with your fellow workers.</i>

08:53.978 --> 08:57.821
<i>Do not under any circumstances
deviate from your designated stations.</i>

08:57.856 --> 08:59.678
<i>Failure to adhere to these guidelines</i>

08:59.712 --> 09:02.659
<i>will result in your
immediate deresolution.</i>

09:02.693 --> 09:04.714
Keep moving.

09:04.748 --> 09:09.055
So, uh, what did they say
this top-secret project was?

09:09.088 --> 09:12.933
They didn't.
That's why it's "top-secret."

09:12.967 --> 09:14.690
Hmm.

09:15.716 --> 09:18.832
All right, all right.
Let's go.

09:34.905 --> 09:36.692
Did you build this place?

09:36.727 --> 09:39.511
<i>I, uh, I repurposed it.</i>

09:39.545 --> 09:42.558
<i>See, all code is
identical, more or less.</i>

09:42.593 --> 09:45.707
<i>So I took what I had and
turned it into what I needed.</i>

09:45.742 --> 09:49.783
What are you?
You're an ISO?

09:49.818 --> 09:53.460
No.
No, I'm not an ISO.

09:53.494 --> 09:54.688
But as you can see,

09:54.722 --> 09:58.764
I don't exactly fit in with
Clu's image of perfection.

10:01.613 --> 10:05.457
<i>I don't envy you being the Renegade.</i>

10:05.491 --> 10:09.301
Feels like the entire
Grid is depending on me.

10:09.336 --> 10:11.688
<i>That's a heavy burden to carry.</i>

10:11.722 --> 10:14.603
<i>And throwing rocks at
Clu isn't going to cut it.</i>

10:14.637 --> 10:17.321
<i>He's growing stronger
with each passing cycle.</i>

10:17.355 --> 10:20.370
If we don't hit back
now, it'll be too late.

10:20.403 --> 10:23.254
<i>I couldn't agree more.</i>

10:26.369 --> 10:30.313
You see... this...
this is what I'm talking about,

10:30.346 --> 10:34.122
this back-and-forth,
like we're of one mind.

10:34.156 --> 10:37.236
I really can't wait to show
you what I've been working on.

10:37.270 --> 10:40.054
I think you're gonna like it.

11:03.286 --> 11:06.764
<i>Dyson: And am I correct to assume Tesler</i>

11:06.765 --> 11:10.243
<i>knows absolutely
nothing of our operation?</i>

11:10.277 --> 11:12.762
<i>- That's correct.
- Fantastic.</i>

11:12.796 --> 11:15.213
<i>Clu's orders are to keep
this under the radar.</i>

11:15.247 --> 11:17.931
<i>We are to trust no one.</i>

11:17.965 --> 11:22.868
<i>- What does it do, the project?
- You'll see soon enough.</i>

11:24.759 --> 11:26.151
<i>Dyson: Looking for something?</i>

11:26.184 --> 11:28.004
Uh... huh?

11:28.038 --> 11:31.021
Seems I've lost the
other members of my group.

11:31.056 --> 11:35.827
They sent me out for a generator,
and I guess I took a wrong turn.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.942
- May I see your disc?
- Soldier: Hey, you!

11:38.975 --> 11:42.686
I'm terribly sorry, Dyson.
He must have wandered off.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.939
If you can't keep your workers in line,

11:44.974 --> 11:49.646
do your best to remember
you are just as replaceable as they are.

12:00.482 --> 12:01.608
Uhh!

12:09.430 --> 12:12.676
- What is this?
- This, my friend,

12:12.710 --> 12:16.388
is what you and I will
use to free the Grid.

12:19.571 --> 12:21.325
Huh?

12:21.360 --> 12:26.463
<i>Perfect symmetry!
The alpha and the omega!</i>

12:26.497 --> 12:29.512
We're going to change the game, Beck.

12:29.545 --> 12:33.454
Together!
And for always!

12:33.488 --> 12:37.331
You're not talking about
freeing the Grid... are you?

12:37.366 --> 12:40.314
Of course I am.

12:40.349 --> 12:44.091
But first...
we'll need to destroy it.

12:44.126 --> 12:47.407
You'd be surprised how
much damage you can do

12:47.441 --> 12:49.495
with a little recycled code.

12:49.529 --> 12:53.106
Especially when energized
by that very storm

12:53.140 --> 12:55.061
that brought you straight to me.

12:55.096 --> 12:59.103
- You're bluffing.
- Do I look like I'm bluffing?

12:59.137 --> 13:01.357
Once I destroy even
a portion of the Grid,

13:01.391 --> 13:03.908
the entire system will crumble!

13:03.943 --> 13:05.864
But you'll kill every living program!

13:05.898 --> 13:10.072
No!
I'll free every living program.

13:11.996 --> 13:16.137
- I won't let you do this.
- Let me?

13:19.055 --> 13:22.135
You and I
are more alike than you know.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.886
Aaah!
We're nothing alike!

13:24.921 --> 13:28.928
Then why do I know every move you're
going to make before you make it?

13:30.818 --> 13:32.009
Aaah!

13:32.542 --> 13:37.346
You're not the first program
Tron trained to fight back.

13:37.380 --> 13:39.433
I am.

13:39.467 --> 13:45.233
Surprise!
I'm the first Renegade!

13:45.266 --> 13:48.579
- I don't believe you!
- That's okay.

13:48.613 --> 13:50.436
We'll be dead soon enough,

13:50.470 --> 13:54.444
wiped out, along with Tron
and the rest of the slaves.

13:54.478 --> 13:58.090
Conserve your strength, Renegade,

13:58.125 --> 14:05.149
because tonight
we shock the Grid.

14:13.926 --> 14:16.179
Do you believe in free will?

14:16.212 --> 14:19.922
- Aaah!
- Yeah, me neither.

14:19.957 --> 14:22.972
Just like I don't believe
that it was coincidence

14:23.006 --> 14:24.727
that brought us together.

14:24.761 --> 14:29.069
All of this...
you being the Renegade,

14:29.103 --> 14:32.018
arriving here at this very moment...

14:32.053 --> 14:36.725
- it's all predetermined.
- I'm here because I got lost.

14:40.801 --> 14:43.881
You think you're acting
beyond your programming,

14:43.882 --> 14:45.936
but this is your programming.

14:45.971 --> 14:49.782
We were meant to free
the system... together.

14:52.565 --> 14:54.586
What's going on?!

14:54.620 --> 14:58.530
I can't detonate an E.M.P.
this powerful by myself.

14:58.563 --> 15:01.612
I need a second energy source
to help me trigger the explosion.

15:01.646 --> 15:04.362
You mean... me?!

15:04.396 --> 15:07.676
Now you're getting it.
But Tron never did.

15:07.710 --> 15:10.624
He thought this space
could contain my genius.

15:10.659 --> 15:14.304
Tron...
trapped you here?

15:14.338 --> 15:18.380
- You're locked in?
- It's a prison, Beck.

15:18.415 --> 15:21.430
My prison.

15:21.463 --> 15:24.378
But all prisons have a key.

15:25.505 --> 15:29.382
Now, I need you to be brave...

15:29.415 --> 15:32.397
because this may hurt a little.

15:35.414 --> 15:38.362
To freedom!

16:03.416 --> 16:06.065
<i>Dyson: Where are you going?</i>

16:07.128 --> 16:10.009
I never did get to see your disc.

16:10.044 --> 16:13.953
Oh, I... I was just, uh...
I was...

16:16.075 --> 16:17.300
Uh...

16:17.334 --> 16:20.117
<i>You were just what?</i>

16:37.019 --> 16:40.828
<i>Your disc...
now.</i>

16:49.778 --> 16:51.698
- What took you so long?
- Able!

16:58.757 --> 17:00.678
- How about that?
- Tron: Behind you!

17:02.636 --> 17:04.887
Protect the device!

17:09.825 --> 17:11.613
- Did you find it yet?
- No!

17:11.646 --> 17:14.731
Do you know how many
floors are in this place?

17:14.765 --> 17:16.817
This is why I usually bring Beck.

17:19.436 --> 17:21.688
Do you even know what
you're looking for?

17:21.721 --> 17:23.742
I'll know it when I find it.

17:47.272 --> 17:50.420
- Found it.
- You know what this means.

17:50.454 --> 17:52.308
I was wrong.

17:52.343 --> 17:56.451
As much as I hate to admit it,
you're gonna need Beck.

17:56.485 --> 18:00.494
Wrong again.
I need both of you.

18:33.898 --> 18:37.311
It's over, Beck.
Tron is wrong.

18:37.346 --> 18:41.222
And I'm about to show you
just how wrong he was.

18:41.256 --> 18:42.911
Aaah!

19:05.645 --> 19:09.720
<i>Beck!
Stay with me.</i>

19:09.754 --> 19:11.047
<i>Beck!</i>

19:11.081 --> 19:12.902
Aaaah!

19:18.039 --> 19:19.860
No... no!

19:21.553 --> 19:23.639
No!!!

19:24.800 --> 19:26.488
What have you done?!

19:26.523 --> 19:28.841
You were right.
Fate did bring us together...

19:28.876 --> 19:30.664
so I could stop you!

19:33.848 --> 19:36.860
Where will you run to?
Back to Tron?

19:39.778 --> 19:46.505
The spirit of the Renegade
ends right here... right now.

19:51.808 --> 19:53.462
Not for me.

19:56.547 --> 19:59.759
<i>No... no!!!</i>

20:28.491 --> 20:32.268
- Where have you been?
- My fault.

20:32.303 --> 20:35.152
<i>I tried to outsmart a storm
on the road to Gallium.</i>

20:35.186 --> 20:39.095
Got myself lost.
And almost for good.

20:39.129 --> 20:44.131
- I'm glad you found your way back.
- Always do.

20:44.165 --> 20:46.485
I guess that's why you picked

20:46.519 --> 20:51.256
One of many reasons, yes.
You're...

20:51.291 --> 20:54.903
Special?

20:54.937 --> 20:59.177

- Right.

21:06.037 --> 21:07.893
Right.
