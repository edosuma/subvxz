00:54.151 --> 00:56.949
I don't know about you, it's
just too hot today, isn't it?

00:57.120 --> 01:01.455
And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...

01:01.625 --> 01:05.322
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,
tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.

01:05.495 --> 01:08.157
So, please, remember to
cover up and stay cool...

01:08.332 --> 01:11.165
...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.

01:11.335 --> 01:14.065
Come on, guys, time to go home.

01:14.838 --> 01:16.931
Come on, love, off you get.

01:18.910 --> 01:22.345
- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.

01:22.946 --> 01:25.881
I'll make you your favorite
dinner to compensate.

01:27.251 --> 01:28.911
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?

01:29.086 --> 01:32.614
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?

01:32.790 --> 01:34.620
Hey, Big D.

01:35.526 --> 01:37.152
Beat up another
10-year-old?

01:37.327 --> 01:39.818
- This one deserved it.
- Yeah.

01:40.397 --> 01:44.630
- Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.

01:44.802 --> 01:50.069
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

01:52.243 --> 01:55.076
"Don't kill Cedric."

01:55.513 --> 01:57.173
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?

01:58.516 --> 02:02.475
- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mum."

02:02.920 --> 02:05.150
Where is your mum?

02:05.989 --> 02:08.618
Where is your mum, Potter?

02:09.092 --> 02:10.856
She dead?

02:12.030 --> 02:13.657
Is she dead?

02:14.165 --> 02:15.530
Is she a dead Pott...?

02:29.747 --> 02:31.545
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.

02:34.453 --> 02:36.283
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

02:36.454 --> 02:39.423
- I'm not doing anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.

02:39.590 --> 02:41.114
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

03:31.477 --> 03:33.411
Dudley, run.

04:09.081 --> 04:10.481
Expecto Patronum.

04:40.346 --> 04:42.109
Mrs. Figg.

04:46.019 --> 04:48.078
Don't put away your wand, Harry.

04:48.388 --> 04:50.754
They might come back.

04:52.058 --> 04:54.993
Dementors in Little Whinging, whatever next?

04:55.161 --> 04:59.120
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy. -
I don't understand. How do you know...?

04:59.299 --> 05:01.495
Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you.

05:01.669 --> 05:05.069
Dumbledore asked you? You know Dumbledore?

05:05.238 --> 05:09.072
After You-Know-Who killed that
poor Diggory boy last year...

05:09.242 --> 05:11.904
...did you expect him to let
you go wandering on your own?

05:12.078 --> 05:14.740
Good Lord, boy. They told
me you were intelligent.

05:14.914 --> 05:18.043
Now, get inside and stay there.

05:18.219 --> 05:22.882
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.

05:32.299 --> 05:34.664
It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.961
There's sweat. There's stifling.

05:37.136 --> 05:39.037
Diddykins?

05:39.373 --> 05:41.398
Is that you?

05:44.612 --> 05:47.740
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.949
We're going to have to take him to a hospital.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.245
Who did this to you, boy?

05:57.658 --> 05:59.421
Happy, are we, now?

06:00.761 --> 06:03.423
You've finally done it. You've
finally driven him loopy.

06:03.597 --> 06:06.395
Vernon, don't say that.

06:06.567 --> 06:10.936
Well, just look at him,
Petunia. Our boy has gone yumpy.

06:11.238 --> 06:13.263
I've reached my limit, do you hear?

06:13.440 --> 06:17.275
This is the last I'm gonna
take of you and your nonsense.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.284
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?

06:33.460 --> 06:38.693
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...

06:38.866 --> 06:43.600
...you performed the Patronus
Charm in the presence of a Muggle.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.863
As a clear violation...

06:46.041 --> 06:50.102
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...

06:50.277 --> 06:52.405
...you are hereby expelled...

06:52.847 --> 06:56.304
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

06:57.018 --> 07:01.421
Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.

07:05.560 --> 07:07.891
Justice.

07:20.141 --> 07:22.337
He's not very well.

07:34.889 --> 07:36.653
Sorry, Hedwig.

08:43.859 --> 08:45.656
Very clean, these Muggles.

08:46.028 --> 08:48.895
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.

08:52.869 --> 08:54.426
Professor Moody.

08:54.870 --> 08:57.896
- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.

09:00.810 --> 09:03.506
But where are we going? The
letter said I've been expelled.

09:03.679 --> 09:06.113
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.

09:06.282 --> 09:07.272
But the letter said...

09:07.451 --> 09:10.477
Dumbledore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...

09:10.654 --> 09:12.815
- ... pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?

09:12.989 --> 09:16.356
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

09:16.526 --> 09:18.824
Not here, Nymphadora.

09:18.995 --> 09:22.828
Don't call me Nymphadora.

09:28.171 --> 09:32.301
Stay in formation, everyone. Don't
break ranks if one of us is killed.

10:22.058 --> 10:24.117
Come on, you, around the corner.

10:26.163 --> 10:27.629
Come on.

11:07.071 --> 11:08.834
In you go, son.

11:10.374 --> 11:11.864
There've been no sightings.

11:12.043 --> 11:13.773
No deaths. No proof.

11:13.945 --> 11:16.813
He almost killed Harry. If
that isn't proof enough...

11:16.981 --> 11:20.917
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important...

11:23.187 --> 11:25.622
We must trust Dumbledore on this.

11:25.790 --> 11:30.193
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Well, tonight I say it's time to take action.

11:30.361 --> 11:33.559
Cornelius Fudge is a politician
first and a wizard second.

11:33.732 --> 11:36.895
- His instinct would be to ignore it...
- Keep your voices down.

11:37.069 --> 11:41.505
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.

11:45.477 --> 11:47.775
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

11:50.415 --> 11:52.905
Heavens, you're all right.

11:56.421 --> 12:00.152
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will
wait until after the meeting's finished.

12:00.325 --> 12:05.456
Nope. No time to explain. Straight
upstairs, first door on the left.

12:05.831 --> 12:07.264
Yeah.

12:09.534 --> 12:14.733
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.

12:14.906 --> 12:19.775
If my poor mistress knew the
scum they let into her house...

12:19.945 --> 12:22.243
...what would she say to old Kreacher?

12:23.281 --> 12:26.273
Oh, the shame.

12:38.698 --> 12:41.394
- Freaks.
- There, there, mistress.

12:41.601 --> 12:44.967
Scum of the earth. Not like it
was in the days of my fathers.

12:45.170 --> 12:47.764
Kreacher is here.

12:51.843 --> 12:53.277
Oh, Harry.

12:56.082 --> 12:59.915
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.

13:00.085 --> 13:02.918
- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.

13:03.088 --> 13:07.287
And this hearing at the
Ministry. It's just outrageous.

13:07.460 --> 13:09.621
I've looked it up. They
simply can't expel you.

13:09.796 --> 13:12.492
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.

13:12.999 --> 13:15.627
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.

13:17.536 --> 13:19.471
So, what is this place?

13:19.639 --> 13:22.335
- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.

13:23.141 --> 13:24.632
It's a secret society.

13:24.811 --> 13:27.371
Dumbledore formed it back
when they fought You-Know-Who.

13:27.547 --> 13:30.107
Couldn't have put any of
this in a letter, I suppose?

13:30.783 --> 13:32.978
I've gone all summer without a scrap of news.

13:33.586 --> 13:37.181
We wanted to write, mate. Really, we did.

13:37.423 --> 13:38.412
- Only...
- Only what?

13:38.591 --> 13:41.788
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

13:43.596 --> 13:45.291
Dumbledore said that?

13:47.100 --> 13:49.830
But why would he keep me in
the dark? Maybe I could help.

13:50.002 --> 13:51.971
I'm the one who saw Voldemort return...

13:52.139 --> 13:54.972
...the one who fought him, who
saw Cedric Diggory get killed.

13:55.141 --> 13:57.337
- Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.

13:57.511 --> 14:01.571
- Don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out.
- If you're all done shouting...

14:01.748 --> 14:04.239
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?

14:05.551 --> 14:08.885
If anyone has a right to know, it's
Harry. If it wasn't for Harry...

14:09.056 --> 14:11.114
...we wouldn't even know Voldemort was back.

14:11.290 --> 14:12.848
He's not a child, Molly.

14:13.025 --> 14:15.392
But he's not an adult either.

14:15.695 --> 14:18.630
- He's not James, Sirius.
- Well, he's not your son.

14:18.798 --> 14:20.960
He's as good as.

14:21.335 --> 14:23.030
- Who else has he got?
- Hey, Ginny.

14:23.203 --> 14:25.637
- He's got me.
- How touchingly paternal, Black.

14:25.806 --> 14:28.900
Perhaps Potter will grow up to be
a felon, just like his godfather.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.838
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.

14:31.010 --> 14:33.070
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.

14:33.246 --> 14:35.112
...about your supposed reformation.

14:35.282 --> 14:38.012
- I know better.
- So why don't you tell him?

14:38.185 --> 14:39.880
- Get off it.
- Quick.

14:40.053 --> 14:41.680
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.

14:42.088 --> 14:44.250
- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.

14:44.424 --> 14:46.688
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.

14:48.662 --> 14:52.325
- Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.

14:53.567 --> 14:56.229
Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.

14:57.171 --> 14:59.504
Just because you're
allowed to use magic now...

14:59.673 --> 15:02.699
...does not mean you have to whip
your wands out for everything.

15:02.876 --> 15:04.468
Hi, Mum.

15:05.445 --> 15:07.174
You hungry, Harry?

15:07.347 --> 15:09.975
You sure you're all right,
Harry? Gave us quite a turn.

15:10.150 --> 15:12.311
Harry Potter.

15:14.521 --> 15:16.319
Sirius.

15:22.063 --> 15:24.326
This is very, very peculiar.

15:24.498 --> 15:28.162
It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.

15:28.336 --> 15:31.772
I don't understand. What has the
Ministry of Magic got against me?

15:32.706 --> 15:36.108
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.

15:46.486 --> 15:49.512
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

15:51.359 --> 15:56.353
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...

15:56.664 --> 15:59.656
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.130
Why?

16:01.301 --> 16:03.270
He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.

16:03.438 --> 16:05.565
No one in their right
mind could believe that...

16:05.740 --> 16:08.607
Exactly the point. Fudge
isn't in his right mind.

16:08.776 --> 16:11.301
It's been twisted and warped by fear.

16:12.981 --> 16:15.415
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.

16:15.584 --> 16:18.017
The last time Voldemort gained power...

16:18.186 --> 16:21.520
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.

16:21.689 --> 16:25.625
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid the
minister will do almost anything...

16:25.793 --> 16:28.728
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

16:29.999 --> 16:34.662
We think Voldemort wants
to build up his army again.

16:35.804 --> 16:38.466
Fourteen years ago, he had
huge numbers at his command.

16:38.641 --> 16:43.202
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.

16:43.812 --> 16:47.839
He's been recruiting heavily, and
we've been attempting to do the same.

16:48.783 --> 16:52.550
But gathering followers isn't
the only thing he's interested in.

16:55.491 --> 16:57.321
We believe...

16:58.294 --> 17:00.261
...Voldemort may be after something.

17:00.428 --> 17:01.521
Sirius.

17:05.166 --> 17:08.034
Something he didn't have last time.

17:09.505 --> 17:11.529
You mean like a weapon?

17:11.705 --> 17:15.768
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.

17:15.944 --> 17:18.742
You say more and you might as
well induct him into the Order.

17:18.914 --> 17:22.714
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.

17:35.197 --> 17:37.062
Harry.

17:37.232 --> 17:39.496
You are hereby expelled.

17:39.668 --> 17:42.466
Before the entire Wizengamot.

17:51.781 --> 17:53.577
Trains. Underground.

17:53.749 --> 17:56.047
Ingenious, these Muggles.

18:13.235 --> 18:15.067
Here we are.

18:16.873 --> 18:21.333
I've never used the visitors'
entrance before. Should be fun.

18:22.044 --> 18:26.379
Right. Good. I'll just get my Muggle money.

19:06.356 --> 19:09.291
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.

19:09.459 --> 19:12.758
Daily Prophet, ladies and
gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet?

19:12.929 --> 19:15.921
Dumbledore: Is he daft, or is he dangerous?

19:37.888 --> 19:40.686
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.

19:43.327 --> 19:44.885
Interdepartmental memos.

19:45.062 --> 19:49.021
We used to use owls. Mess was unbelievable.

19:54.171 --> 19:57.607
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.

19:57.775 --> 20:01.142
- They've changed the time of your hearing.
- When is it?

20:01.545 --> 20:03.410
In five minutes.

20:11.088 --> 20:14.319
Department of Mysteries.

20:16.861 --> 20:20.992
And I'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.

20:21.166 --> 20:23.258
Yes, but we must be...

20:30.408 --> 20:33.843
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.

20:34.011 --> 20:37.538
Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.

20:37.848 --> 20:41.114
As the Muggles say, truth will out.

20:41.620 --> 20:42.984
Yes?

20:44.156 --> 20:46.454
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.

20:48.093 --> 20:49.856
Good luck, Harry.

20:53.798 --> 20:56.323
Disciplinary hearing of the 12th of August...

20:56.501 --> 20:59.436
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...

20:59.604 --> 21:03.232
...resident at Number 4 Privet
Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.

21:03.408 --> 21:06.502
Interrogators: Cornelius
Oswald Fudge, Minister of Mag...

21:06.678 --> 21:08.509
Witness for the defense.

21:08.680 --> 21:11.843
Albus Percival Wulfric...

21:12.184 --> 21:15.585
...Brian Dumbledore.

21:15.887 --> 21:19.152
You got our message that the
time and place of the hearing...

21:19.324 --> 21:21.884
- ... had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.

21:22.060 --> 21:25.997
But by a happy mistake, I arrived
at the Ministry three hours early.

21:28.968 --> 21:30.161
The charges?

21:30.335 --> 21:32.860
The charges against the
accused are as follows:

21:33.038 --> 21:34.666
"That he did knowingly...

21:34.840 --> 21:38.400
...and in full awareness of
the illegality of his actions...

21:38.577 --> 21:41.569
...produce a Patronus Charm...

21:41.746 --> 21:44.977
...in the presence of a Muggle."

21:45.150 --> 21:48.449
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but...

21:48.621 --> 21:52.079
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...

21:52.258 --> 21:55.125
- ... while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but...

21:55.294 --> 21:58.660
Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot...

21:58.830 --> 22:01.061
I was only doing it because of the Dementors.

22:03.803 --> 22:05.430
Dementors?

22:06.038 --> 22:07.732
In Little Whinging?

22:07.906 --> 22:10.239
That's quite clever.

22:10.408 --> 22:13.536
Muggles can't see Dementors, can they, boy?

22:13.812 --> 22:15.940
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.

22:16.115 --> 22:18.675
- There were two of them, and if I hadn't...
- Enough.

22:18.851 --> 22:23.049
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would
have been a very well-rehearsed story...

22:23.222 --> 22:27.716
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event...

22:27.893 --> 22:32.489
Pardon me, minister, but
as it happens, we can.

22:35.835 --> 22:38.929
Please describe the attack.

22:41.707 --> 22:43.504
What did they look like?

22:44.076 --> 22:49.514
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.

22:50.617 --> 22:53.415
Not the boys. The Dementors.

22:53.587 --> 22:57.249
Oh, right, right. Well, big.

22:58.457 --> 23:03.054
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...

23:03.696 --> 23:07.097
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.

23:07.266 --> 23:12.363
Now, look here. Dementors don't
just wander into a Muggle suburb...

23:12.538 --> 23:16.168
...and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.

23:16.343 --> 23:18.071
I don't think anyone would believe...

23:18.244 --> 23:21.270
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

23:23.816 --> 23:26.683
I'm sure I must have
misunderstood you, professor.

23:26.852 --> 23:32.348
Dementors are, after all, under the
control of the Ministry of Magic.

23:32.525 --> 23:36.724
And it's so silly of me, but it
sounded for a moment as though...

23:36.897 --> 23:40.890
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

23:41.068 --> 23:43.866
That would be disturbing
indeed, Madam Undersecretary...

23:44.037 --> 23:48.201
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...

23:48.375 --> 23:51.742
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...

23:51.912 --> 23:55.279
...and why they mounted an
attack without authorization.

23:56.149 --> 23:58.380
Of course, there is someone...

23:58.720 --> 24:01.314
...who might be behind the attack.

24:04.325 --> 24:08.954
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.

24:09.129 --> 24:13.691
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.

24:13.867 --> 24:16.631
He is not back.

24:22.542 --> 24:24.738
In the matter of Harry Potter...

24:25.312 --> 24:27.747
...the law clearly states...

24:27.982 --> 24:32.385
...that magic may be used before
Muggles in life-threatening situations.

24:32.553 --> 24:35.454
Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore.

24:35.623 --> 24:38.786
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...

24:38.960 --> 24:41.827
...to deal with a simple
matter of underage magic?

24:50.238 --> 24:53.799
Those in favor of conviction?

25:02.617 --> 25:07.554
Those in favor of clearing
the accused of all charges?

25:21.669 --> 25:23.933
Cleared of all charges.

25:26.974 --> 25:28.704
Professor.

25:41.656 --> 25:44.716
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?

25:44.892 --> 25:47.258
You'll blow the entire operation.

25:55.671 --> 25:58.299
Sirius, what are you doing
here? If somebody sees you...

25:58.474 --> 26:01.068
I had to see you off, didn't I?

26:02.878 --> 26:05.369
What's life without a little risk?

26:05.581 --> 26:07.912
I don't wanna see you get
chucked back in Azkaban.

26:08.083 --> 26:09.550
Don't worry about me.

26:09.985 --> 26:14.979
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.

26:20.362 --> 26:23.388
Original Order of the Phoenix.

26:23.932 --> 26:25.661
Marlene McKinnon.

26:25.834 --> 26:28.394
She was killed two weeks after this was taken.

26:28.770 --> 26:31.933
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.

26:32.374 --> 26:34.171
Frank and Alice Longbottom.

26:34.343 --> 26:35.833
Neville's parents.

26:36.011 --> 26:39.675
They suffered a fate worse
than death, you ask me.

26:41.617 --> 26:44.085
It's been 14 years.

26:44.921 --> 26:49.118
And still a day doesn't go
by I don't miss your dad.

26:53.796 --> 26:56.458
Do you really think there's
going to be a war, Sirius?

26:59.135 --> 27:02.161
It feels like it did before.

27:06.408 --> 27:08.206
You keep it.

27:08.678 --> 27:13.081
Anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now.

27:15.284 --> 27:17.116
I'll see you at the train.

27:17.287 --> 27:19.312
Bye-bye, darling.

27:20.223 --> 27:21.690
I love you.

27:22.458 --> 27:24.449
Hold my hand, lovey.

27:24.727 --> 27:26.990
There they are. They're in the far carriage.

27:27.163 --> 27:28.460
Bye.

28:10.674 --> 28:13.609
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.

28:13.776 --> 28:15.244
Better enjoy it while you can.

28:15.412 --> 28:18.711
I expect there's a cell in
Azkaban with your name on it.

28:21.318 --> 28:25.277
- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!

28:26.490 --> 28:28.321
It's only Malfoy.

28:29.159 --> 28:30.990
What'd you expect?

28:50.981 --> 28:52.141
Hi, guys.

28:52.316 --> 28:53.977
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.

29:07.031 --> 29:08.555
What is it?

29:10.734 --> 29:13.999
- What's what?
- That. Pulling the carriage.

29:14.839 --> 29:17.137
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.

29:17.776 --> 29:20.006
It's pulling itself, like always.

29:33.624 --> 29:35.854
You're not going mad.

29:38.430 --> 29:40.660
I can see them too.

29:41.932 --> 29:44.527
You're just as sane as I am.

29:49.340 --> 29:51.399
Everyone, this is Loony Love...

29:54.212 --> 29:56.112
Luna Lovegood.

30:00.051 --> 30:02.383
What an interesting necklace.

30:02.921 --> 30:05.081
It's a charm, actually.

30:06.458 --> 30:08.050
Keeps away the Nargles.

30:11.830 --> 30:13.320
Hungry.

30:13.998 --> 30:15.966
I hope there's pudding.

30:16.968 --> 30:20.563
- What's a Nargle?
- No idea.

30:33.284 --> 30:34.876
Good evening, children.

30:36.188 --> 30:38.917
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.

30:39.091 --> 30:42.117
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...

30:42.294 --> 30:44.854
...who'll be taking Care
of Magical Creatures...

30:45.030 --> 30:48.488
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.

30:49.334 --> 30:53.328
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...

30:53.506 --> 30:56.669
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.

30:56.976 --> 31:00.707
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.

31:01.513 --> 31:06.508
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr.
Filch, has asked me to remind you...

31:17.596 --> 31:20.326
She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge.

31:20.499 --> 31:26.199
Thank you, headmaster, for
those kind words of welcome.

31:27.573 --> 31:31.236
And how lovely to see all your bright...

31:31.410 --> 31:34.243
...happy faces smiling up at me.

31:34.613 --> 31:39.812
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.

31:39.985 --> 31:42.215
- That's likely.
- That's likely.

31:45.057 --> 31:48.026
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...

31:48.194 --> 31:53.791
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.

31:54.166 --> 31:56.430
Although each headmaster...

31:56.602 --> 32:01.438
...has brought something new
to this historic school...

32:03.008 --> 32:09.140
...progress for the sake of
progress must be discouraged.

32:09.883 --> 32:13.717
Let us preserve what must be preserved...

32:13.887 --> 32:17.378
...perfect what can be perfected...

32:17.556 --> 32:24.156
...and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.

32:31.238 --> 32:35.334
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.

32:35.508 --> 32:39.877
- Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?

32:40.614 --> 32:42.775
Magic is forbidden in the corridors...

32:42.949 --> 32:46.510
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.

33:06.307 --> 33:08.035
Dean, Seamus.

33:08.341 --> 33:10.468
- Good holiday?
- All right.

33:10.844 --> 33:13.074
Better than Seamus', anyway.

33:14.382 --> 33:16.713
Me mum didn't want me to come back this year.

33:16.883 --> 33:20.183
- Why not?
- Let me see. Because of you.

33:20.621 --> 33:23.988
The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot
of things about you and Dumbledore.

33:24.158 --> 33:25.489
What, your mum believes them?

33:25.660 --> 33:27.559
Nobody was there the night Cedric died.

33:27.727 --> 33:30.821
I guess you should read the Prophet,
then, like your stupid mother.

33:30.997 --> 33:34.490
- Don't talk about my mother.
- I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar.

33:34.669 --> 33:37.160
- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.

33:37.338 --> 33:40.432
Do you believe the rubbish he's
come out with about You-Know-Who?

33:40.608 --> 33:42.234
Yeah. I do.

33:43.277 --> 33:45.211
Has anyone else got a problem with Harry?

33:54.655 --> 33:57.055
- You all right?
- Fine.

33:57.224 --> 34:00.022
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.

34:00.594 --> 34:04.360
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.

34:08.036 --> 34:12.438
Right. I'll just leave
you to your thoughts, then.

34:40.900 --> 34:41.891
Harry.

34:57.352 --> 34:59.513
Bring it over here. Over here.

35:00.422 --> 35:03.289
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.

35:18.940 --> 35:20.339
Good morning, children.

35:22.377 --> 35:27.508
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.

35:27.682 --> 35:30.277
O-W-Ls.

35:30.452 --> 35:35.014
More commonly known as OWLs.

35:35.190 --> 35:38.319
Study hard and you will be rewarded.

35:38.661 --> 35:43.928
Fail to do so, and the
consequences may be severe.

35:49.505 --> 35:54.567
Your previous instruction in this
subject has been disturbingly uneven.

35:54.743 --> 35:56.870
But you'll be pleased to know, from now on...

35:57.045 --> 36:00.537
...you will be following a carefully
structured, Ministry-approved...

36:00.716 --> 36:03.411
...course of defensive magic. Yes?

36:04.754 --> 36:07.348
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?

36:07.523 --> 36:09.046
Using spells?

36:09.225 --> 36:12.683
Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.

36:14.396 --> 36:15.989
We're not gonna use magic?

36:16.165 --> 36:21.159
You'll be learning about defensive
spells in a secure, risk-free way.

36:21.337 --> 36:24.101
What use is that? If we're
attacked, it won't be risk-free.

36:24.273 --> 36:27.208
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.

36:30.847 --> 36:33.247
It is the view of the Ministry...

36:33.416 --> 36:36.180
...that a theoretical
knowledge will be sufficient...

36:36.352 --> 36:38.320
...to get you through your examinations...

36:38.488 --> 36:40.922
...which, after all, is
what school is all about.

36:41.090 --> 36:43.888
And how's theory supposed to
prepare us for what's out there?

36:44.060 --> 36:46.086
There is nothing out there, dear.

36:46.263 --> 36:49.289
Who do you imagine wants to
attack children like yourself?

36:49.465 --> 36:52.730
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.

37:03.413 --> 37:07.906
Now, let me make this quite plain.

37:08.452 --> 37:09.919
You have been told...

37:10.086 --> 37:15.457
...that a certain dark
wizard is at large once again.

37:15.626 --> 37:20.757
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.

37:20.931 --> 37:22.558
Detention, Mr. Potter.

37:22.733 --> 37:24.893
Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord?

37:25.067 --> 37:27.502
Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident.

37:27.670 --> 37:29.832
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.

37:30.007 --> 37:31.474
Enough!

37:32.142 --> 37:33.837
Enough.

37:34.011 --> 37:38.311
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.

38:03.073 --> 38:04.267
Come in.

38:09.513 --> 38:11.448
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

38:12.082 --> 38:13.345
Sit.

38:21.058 --> 38:24.961
You're going to be doing some
lines for me today, Mr. Potter.

38:25.129 --> 38:26.993
No, not with your quill.

38:27.231 --> 38:30.429
Going to be using a
rather special one of mine.

38:35.572 --> 38:36.972
Now...

38:37.941 --> 38:43.811
...I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies."

38:45.883 --> 38:47.783
How many times?

38:48.219 --> 38:52.883
Well, let's say for as long as it
takes for the message to sink in.

38:54.892 --> 38:56.553
You haven't given me any ink.

38:56.728 --> 38:58.218
Oh, you won't need any ink.

39:49.481 --> 39:50.971
Yes?

39:58.290 --> 40:01.691
- Nothing.
- That's right.

40:02.594 --> 40:06.553
Because you know, deep down...

40:06.732 --> 40:08.790
...you deserve to be punished.

40:09.968 --> 40:12.129
Don't you, Mr. Potter?

40:16.375 --> 40:17.967
Go on.

40:27.019 --> 40:29.283
- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.

40:29.455 --> 40:31.082
Get out of class whenever you like.

40:31.256 --> 40:35.023
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.

40:36.028 --> 40:37.360
Care for another?

40:37.530 --> 40:40.055
I'm not asking you to write all of it for me.

40:40.233 --> 40:43.202
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.

40:43.670 --> 40:45.466
I'll do the introduction. That's all.

40:45.637 --> 40:49.404
Hermione, you're honestly the most
wonderful person I've ever met.

40:49.576 --> 40:53.807
- And if I'm ever rude to you again...
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.

40:58.851 --> 41:00.945
What's wrong with your hand?

41:01.487 --> 41:02.955
Nothing.

41:04.224 --> 41:06.124
The other hand.

41:08.628 --> 41:10.458
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.

41:10.629 --> 41:12.825
Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now.

41:12.999 --> 41:15.126
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.

41:15.301 --> 41:17.735
Bloody hell, Harry. The woman's torturing you.

41:17.904 --> 41:21.840
- If the parents knew about this...
- I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?

41:24.644 --> 41:27.112
Harry, you've got to report this.

41:27.280 --> 41:30.807
- It's perfectly simple. You're being...
- No, it's not.

41:30.984 --> 41:33.817
Hermione, whatever this is, it's not simple.

41:34.854 --> 41:36.879
You don't understand.

41:39.493 --> 41:41.426
Then help us to.

41:56.142 --> 41:58.007
Dear Padfoot...

41:58.545 --> 42:00.274
...I hope you're all right.

42:00.447 --> 42:05.044
It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.

42:07.688 --> 42:12.420
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.

42:13.294 --> 42:16.593
I know you, of all people, will understand.

42:50.698 --> 42:52.893
Hello, Harry Potter.

42:55.537 --> 43:00.166
- Your feet. Aren ' t they cold?
- Bit.

43:01.075 --> 43:05.102
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.

43:05.679 --> 43:08.739
I suspect Nargles are behind it.

43:15.089 --> 43:18.719
- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.

43:19.393 --> 43:24.457
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...

43:27.402 --> 43:29.028
Different.

43:32.139 --> 43:34.505
But why can't the others see them?

43:34.675 --> 43:38.203
They can only be seen by
people who've seen death.

43:40.314 --> 43:42.942
So you've known someone who's died, then?

43:43.117 --> 43:44.745
My mum.

43:45.287 --> 43:50.190
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...

43:50.358 --> 43:53.657
...and one day, one of her
spells went badly wrong.

43:53.828 --> 43:56.228
- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.

43:56.798 --> 43:58.993
Yes, it was rather horrible.

43:59.167 --> 44:04.503
I do feel very sad about it
sometimes, but I've got Dad.

44:06.741 --> 44:09.369
We both believe you, by the way.

44:12.447 --> 44:15.439
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is back, and you fought him...

44:15.617 --> 44:18.711
...and the Ministry and the
Prophet are conspiring against you.

44:18.887 --> 44:23.257
Thanks. It seems you're
about the only ones that do.

44:23.426 --> 44:24.756
I don't think that's true.

44:27.128 --> 44:30.256
But I suppose that's how he wants you to feel.

44:30.432 --> 44:32.196
What do you mean?

44:32.834 --> 44:34.700
Well, if I were
You-Know-Who...

44:35.171 --> 44:38.731
...I'd want you to feel cut
off from everyone else...

44:38.907 --> 44:41.637
...because if it's just you alone...

44:42.477 --> 44:44.809
...you're not as much of a threat.

45:02.465 --> 45:07.198
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.

45:10.572 --> 45:11.631
Harry.

45:13.475 --> 45:14.704
Can I join you?

45:16.612 --> 45:19.740
Pardon me, professor, but what
exactly are you insinuating?

45:19.915 --> 45:22.679
I am merely requesting that
when it comes to my students...

45:22.852 --> 45:27.118
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.

45:27.289 --> 45:28.950
So silly of me, but it sounds...

45:29.125 --> 45:33.255
...as if you're questioning my
authority in my own classroom...

45:33.429 --> 45:34.760
...Minerva.

45:34.930 --> 45:39.391
Not at all, Dolores, merely
your medieval methods.

45:39.670 --> 45:42.138
I am sorry, dear.

45:42.305 --> 45:45.638
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...

45:45.808 --> 45:48.936
...and by extension, the minister himself.

45:49.111 --> 45:50.704
I am a tolerant woman...

45:50.881 --> 45:55.943
...but the one thing I will
not stand for is disloyalty.

45:57.720 --> 45:59.484
Disloyalty.

46:01.223 --> 46:05.183
Things at Hogwarts are
far worse than I feared.

46:05.362 --> 46:08.820
Cornelius will want to take immediate action.

46:20.243 --> 46:22.143
What's happened to Dumbledore?

46:22.312 --> 46:24.872
Having already revolutionized...

46:25.048 --> 46:27.710
...the teaching of Defense
Against the Dark Arts...

46:29.386 --> 46:32.844
...Dolores Umbridge will, as
high inquisitor, have powers...

46:35.358 --> 46:39.522
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.

46:47.304 --> 46:49.465
Just one question, dear.

46:49.639 --> 46:53.837
You've been in this post how long, exactly?

47:00.650 --> 47:05.747
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?

47:05.922 --> 47:07.913
Yes.

47:08.325 --> 47:10.953
But you were unsuccessful?

47:12.162 --> 47:14.596
Obviously.

47:46.931 --> 47:50.367
Could you please predict something for me?

47:52.103 --> 47:53.297
I'm sorry?

47:58.543 --> 48:00.738
Move those mouths.

48:06.884 --> 48:09.978
One teensy little prophecy?

48:15.860 --> 48:17.294
Pity.

48:17.863 --> 48:20.263
No, wait. Wait, no. I
think I do see something.

48:20.432 --> 48:22.626
Yes, I do. Something dark.

48:22.901 --> 48:27.428
You are in grave danger.

48:28.907 --> 48:30.635
Lovely.

48:40.819 --> 48:42.980
Cho. What's going on?

48:43.155 --> 48:45.487
It's Professor Trelawney.

49:15.320 --> 49:18.812
Sixteen years I've lived and taught here.

49:18.991 --> 49:21.926
Hogwarts is my home.

49:23.829 --> 49:25.729
You can't do this.

49:27.165 --> 49:29.429
Actually, I can.

49:38.310 --> 49:39.676
Something you'd like to say?

49:39.846 --> 49:42.508
Oh, there are several
things I would like to say.

49:43.081 --> 49:44.640
There...

49:58.563 --> 50:03.228
Professor McGonagall, might I ask
you to escort Sybil back inside?

50:04.537 --> 50:07.004
Sybil, dear. This way.

50:07.172 --> 50:08.663
Thank you.

50:09.841 --> 50:13.869
Dumbledore, may I remind
you that under the terms...

50:14.047 --> 50:17.312
...of Educational Decree Number
23, as enacted by the minister...

50:17.483 --> 50:20.646
You have the right to dismiss my teachers.

50:20.820 --> 50:24.381
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.

50:24.557 --> 50:27.583
That power remains with the headmaster.

50:29.595 --> 50:30.857
For now.

50:37.303 --> 50:39.294
Don't you all have studying to do?

50:39.472 --> 50:40.632
Professor.

50:42.475 --> 50:43.567
Professor?

50:44.044 --> 50:46.842
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!

50:47.014 --> 50:49.140
Professor Dumbledore.

50:59.826 --> 51:01.920
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.

51:02.462 --> 51:07.491
We're not learning how to defend ourselves.
We're not learning how to pass our OWLs.

51:07.868 --> 51:09.893
She's taking over the entire school.

51:10.070 --> 51:14.733
Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.

51:14.907 --> 51:17.740
Furthermore, we have convincing evidence...

51:17.911 --> 51:20.778
...that these disappearances are the work...

51:20.948 --> 51:24.349
...of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black.

51:25.085 --> 51:26.643
Harry.

51:26.887 --> 51:28.581
Sirius.

51:29.323 --> 51:32.019
- What are you doing here?
- Answering your letter.

51:32.192 --> 51:35.093
You said you were worried about
Umbridge. What's she doing?

51:35.262 --> 51:37.196
Training you to kill half-breeds?

51:37.363 --> 51:40.333
- She's not letting us use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not surprised.

51:40.701 --> 51:44.762
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.

51:44.938 --> 51:45.927
Combat?

51:46.440 --> 51:49.341
What does he think, we're
forming some sort of wizard army?

51:49.510 --> 51:50.909
That's exactly what he thinks.

51:51.078 --> 51:55.014
That Dumbledore is assembling his
own forces to take on the Ministry.

51:55.549 --> 51:58.848
He's becoming more paranoid by the minute.

51:59.219 --> 52:02.677
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...

52:03.224 --> 52:06.057
...but things aren't going
at all well with the Order.

52:06.227 --> 52:08.855
Fudge is blocking the truth at every turn...

52:09.030 --> 52:13.022
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.

52:13.834 --> 52:17.168
Voldemort is on the move.

52:17.572 --> 52:18.970
Well, what can we do?

52:19.573 --> 52:21.007
Someone's coming.

52:21.176 --> 52:23.371
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

52:23.545 --> 52:28.539
But for now, at least, it
looks like you're on your own.

52:40.095 --> 52:42.427
He really is out there, isn't he?

52:44.265 --> 52:46.927
We've got to be able to defend ourselves.

52:47.502 --> 52:51.268
And if Umbridge refuses to teach
us how, we need someone who will.

53:08.289 --> 53:10.450
Harry.

53:20.034 --> 53:22.401
This is mad. Who'd wanna be taught by me?

53:22.571 --> 53:23.798
I'm a nutter, remember?

53:23.972 --> 53:28.467
Look on the bright side: you can't
be any worse than old toad face.

53:28.710 --> 53:32.168
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.

53:32.680 --> 53:35.012
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?

53:35.183 --> 53:37.311
Just a couple of people.

53:42.324 --> 53:43.756
Lovely spot.

53:47.463 --> 53:49.589
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.

53:49.764 --> 53:51.926
Matey, come back here.

54:00.376 --> 54:01.536
Hi.

54:01.944 --> 54:04.845
So you all know why we're here.

54:05.014 --> 54:06.242
We need a teacher.

54:07.950 --> 54:10.111
A proper teacher.

54:10.419 --> 54:13.582
One who's had experience defending
themselves against the Dark Arts.

54:13.756 --> 54:15.520
- Why?
- Why?

54:15.691 --> 54:17.750
Because You-Know-Who's
back, you tosspot.

54:17.927 --> 54:19.485
- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.

54:19.662 --> 54:21.789
So Dumbledore says because he says.

54:21.964 --> 54:24.364
The point is, where's the proof?

54:25.734 --> 54:28.760
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...

54:31.874 --> 54:35.641
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.

54:35.812 --> 54:39.247
Come on, Hermione. They're here because
they think I'm some sort of freak.

54:39.415 --> 54:42.043
Is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm?

54:45.354 --> 54:46.788
Yes.

54:48.257 --> 54:49.691
I've seen it.

54:49.859 --> 54:51.985
Blimey, Harry. I didn't
know you could do that.

54:52.662 --> 54:56.791
And he killed a basilisk, with
the sword in Dumbledore's office.

54:56.966 --> 54:58.195
It's true.

54:58.368 --> 55:01.132
Third year, he fought off about
a hundred Dementors at once.

55:02.439 --> 55:05.237
Last year, he really did fight
off You-Know-Who in the flesh.

55:05.407 --> 55:06.705
Wait.

55:07.410 --> 55:11.937
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...

55:12.115 --> 55:15.676
...but the truth is, most
of that was just luck.

55:15.952 --> 55:19.683
I didn't know what I was doing half
the time. I nearly always had help.

55:19.856 --> 55:23.348
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.

55:25.928 --> 55:30.593
Facing this stuff in real
life is not like school.

55:31.635 --> 55:35.071
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.

55:35.238 --> 55:36.728
But out there...

55:37.340 --> 55:40.639
...when you're a second
away from being murdered...

55:40.810 --> 55:44.507
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...

55:47.284 --> 55:49.082
You don't know what that's like.

55:58.862 --> 56:00.763
You're right, Harry, we don't.

56:01.531 --> 56:03.625
That's why we need your help.

56:03.801 --> 56:06.702
Because if we're going to
have any chance at beating...

56:08.906 --> 56:10.065
...Voldemort...

56:13.510 --> 56:15.240
He's really back.

56:37.568 --> 56:39.228
Right. First we need to
find a place to practice...

56:39.402 --> 56:40.802
...where Umbridge won't find out.

56:40.971 --> 56:43.132
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.

56:43.307 --> 56:46.276
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.

56:46.444 --> 56:48.537
Harry, what happens if Umbridge does find out?

56:48.713 --> 56:49.873
Who cares?

56:50.481 --> 56:55.350
I mean, it's sort of exciting,
isn't it, breaking the rules?

56:55.519 --> 56:57.783
Who are you and what have
you done with Hermione?

56:58.489 --> 57:02.153
Anyway, at least we know one
positive thing that came from today.

57:02.327 --> 57:03.623
What's that?

57:05.364 --> 57:08.026
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you, could she?

57:10.769 --> 57:13.829
Right. Over the next few
days, we should each come up...

57:14.005 --> 57:16.838
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.

57:17.008 --> 57:20.841
We've got to make sure, wherever it
is, there's no chance she can find us.

57:21.011 --> 57:22.843
Will do, Harry.

57:31.590 --> 57:35.719
All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.

57:35.894 --> 57:39.489
Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.

57:39.698 --> 57:42.166
Watch where you're going, Longbottom.

58:17.869 --> 58:22.135
You've done it, Neville. You
found the Room of Requirement.

58:22.307 --> 58:23.433
The what?

58:23.608 --> 58:26.008
It's also known as the Come and Go Room.

58:26.178 --> 58:29.615
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.

58:29.782 --> 58:32.444
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.

58:32.618 --> 58:36.349
So say you really needed the toilet...

58:37.522 --> 58:42.357
Charming, Ronald. But, yes,
that is the general idea.

58:42.527 --> 58:47.397
It's brilliant. It's like
Hogwarts wants us to fight back.

58:58.444 --> 58:59.933
Expelliarmus.

59:05.084 --> 59:06.483
I'm hopeless.

59:06.652 --> 59:10.418
You're just flourishing your wand too
much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.

59:13.793 --> 59:17.820
You will please copy the
approved text four times...

59:17.997 --> 59:20.989
...to ensure maximum retention.

59:21.367 --> 59:25.064
- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.

59:25.238 --> 59:27.263
- Expelliarmus.
- Wands away.

59:40.220 --> 59:43.280
Stunning is one of the most
useful spells in your arsenal.

59:43.457 --> 59:45.687
It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.

59:45.859 --> 59:49.420
So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.

59:55.935 --> 59:57.335
Stupefy!

01:00:02.241 --> 01:00:06.679
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.

01:00:12.052 --> 01:00:14.145
Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.

01:00:14.521 --> 01:00:16.511
Thanks, Ronald.

01:00:19.191 --> 01:00:21.387
- Come on, Ron.
- Come on, Ron.

01:00:21.562 --> 01:00:24.429
- You can do it.
- Come on, Ron.

01:00:24.964 --> 01:00:26.990
- One Sickle.
- You're on.

01:00:34.041 --> 01:00:35.406
Stupefy.

01:00:41.081 --> 01:00:43.049
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:48.047
I let her do that. It's
good manners, isn't it?

01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:52.815
It was completely intentional.

01:01:18.452 --> 01:01:21.387
Up you come. Would you like a cup of tea?

01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:27.650
Now, focus on a fixed point and try again.

01:01:28.229 --> 01:01:30.197
Expelliarmus.

01:01:31.766 --> 01:01:34.326
Very good. Keep your concentration.

01:01:36.437 --> 01:01:37.927
Great.

01:01:39.207 --> 01:01:40.799
A little higher.

01:01:49.283 --> 01:01:52.116
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:02:10.139 --> 01:02:12.767
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

01:02:14.342 --> 01:02:17.709
Those wishing to join the
Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

01:02:17.879 --> 01:02:20.746
...may sign up in the
high inquisitor's office.

01:02:20.916 --> 01:02:22.542
Diminuendo.

01:02:28.456 --> 01:02:32.757
Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:

01:02:32.928 --> 01:02:35.123
Believing in yourself.

01:02:35.297 --> 01:02:37.423
- Expelliarmus.
- Levicorpus. Got it.

01:02:37.598 --> 01:02:39.157
Think of it this way.

01:02:39.334 --> 01:02:43.326
Every great wizard in
history has started out...

01:02:43.672 --> 01:02:47.574
...as nothing more than
what we are now: students.

01:02:47.743 --> 01:02:50.678
If they can do it, why not us?

01:03:00.823 --> 01:03:02.620
- Stupefy.
- Expelliarmus.

01:03:04.793 --> 01:03:06.158
Expelliarmus.

01:03:08.865 --> 01:03:10.354
Expelliarmus.

01:03:15.904 --> 01:03:17.201
Reducto.

01:03:30.719 --> 01:03:33.711
- Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus.

01:03:33.889 --> 01:03:36.255
Expelliarmus.

01:03:40.163 --> 01:03:42.221
Expelliarmus.

01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:49.470
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.

01:03:51.106 --> 01:03:53.233
So that's it for this lesson.

01:03:53.408 --> 01:03:56.809
Now, we' re not gonna be meeting
again until after the holidays.

01:03:57.213 --> 01:04:00.239
So just keep practicing on
your own as best you can.

01:04:00.416 --> 01:04:03.783
And well done, everyone. Great, great work.

01:04:08.591 --> 01:04:10.024
Well done, mate.

01:04:10.193 --> 01:04:11.626
Thanks.

01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:19.666
See you after Christmas.

01:04:29.112 --> 01:04:31.171
See you in the Common Room, Harry.

01:04:32.582 --> 01:04:35.278
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.

01:04:37.053 --> 01:04:39.420
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.

01:04:39.889 --> 01:04:42.256
- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

01:04:42.426 --> 01:04:44.290
- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas.

01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:47.054
- Have a great Christmas, Luna.
- We've been thinking.

01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:49.630
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.

01:04:49.799 --> 01:04:52.461
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils...

01:04:52.635 --> 01:04:55.160
Sounds great, guys. Would you excuse me?

01:05:06.115 --> 01:05:10.849
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.

01:05:11.021 --> 01:05:13.387
Yeah. I'm okay.

01:05:14.091 --> 01:05:16.889
Anyway, it's worth it.

01:05:22.233 --> 01:05:25.396
It's just, learning all this...

01:05:26.171 --> 01:05:29.606
...makes me wonder
whether, if he'd known it...

01:05:29.774 --> 01:05:32.504
Cedric did know this stuff.

01:05:33.078 --> 01:05:35.477
He was really good.

01:05:36.114 --> 01:05:38.844
It's just, Voldemort was better.

01:05:43.388 --> 01:05:45.185
You're a really good teacher, Harry.

01:05:46.458 --> 01:05:49.359
I've never been able to stun anything before.

01:05:58.504 --> 01:06:00.164
Mistletoe.

01:06:03.675 --> 01:06:05.609
Probably full of Nargles, though.

01:06:06.679 --> 01:06:08.373
What are Nargles?

01:06:09.081 --> 01:06:10.810
No idea.

01:06:32.839 --> 01:06:35.034
Well, how was it?

01:06:35.808 --> 01:06:37.570
Wet.

01:06:37.977 --> 01:06:39.740
I mean, she was sort of crying.

01:06:40.112 --> 01:06:42.081
That bad at it, are you?

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:44.978
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.

01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:49.981
Cho spends half her time crying these days.

01:06:50.156 --> 01:06:52.420
You'd think a bit of
snogging would cheer her up.

01:06:53.893 --> 01:06:56.760
Don't you understand how she must be feeling?

01:07:01.167 --> 01:07:04.625
Well, obviously she's
feeling sad about Cedric...

01:07:04.804 --> 01:07:07.864
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...

01:07:08.041 --> 01:07:11.272
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:15.175
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.

01:07:17.116 --> 01:07:20.678
One person couldn't feel
all that. They'd explode.

01:07:20.854 --> 01:07:24.084
Just because you've got the
emotional range of a teaspoon...

01:07:39.938 --> 01:07:41.564
Harry.

01:07:50.348 --> 01:07:53.408
Voldemort may be after something.

01:07:54.086 --> 01:07:57.078
Something he didn't have last time.

01:07:57.923 --> 01:07:59.184
Harry.

01:08:00.826 --> 01:08:02.087
Harry.

01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:36.594
In the dream, were you
standing next to the victim...

01:08:36.763 --> 01:08:38.252
...or looking down at the scene?

01:08:38.731 --> 01:08:41.700
Neither. It was like I...

01:08:42.268 --> 01:08:44.359
Will you please just tell me what's happening?

01:08:44.536 --> 01:08:46.868
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.

01:08:47.038 --> 01:08:49.439
Make sure he's found by the right people.

01:08:49.608 --> 01:08:51.167
- Sir.
- Phineas.

01:08:51.344 --> 01:08:53.642
You must go to your
portrait at Grimmauld Place.

01:08:53.813 --> 01:08:56.441
Tell them that Arthur
Weasley is gravely injured...

01:08:56.616 --> 01:09:00.779
...and his children will be
arriving there soon by Portkey.

01:09:00.953 --> 01:09:04.013
They've got him, Albus. It was
close, but they think he'll make it.

01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:06.714
What's more, the Dark
Lord failed to acquire it.

01:09:06.892 --> 01:09:08.792
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...

01:09:08.962 --> 01:09:10.156
Look at me!

01:09:16.669 --> 01:09:18.899
What's happening to me?

01:09:26.779 --> 01:09:28.645
You wished to see me, headmaster?

01:09:28.814 --> 01:09:33.718
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't
wait. Not even till the morning.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:37.020
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.

01:09:41.795 --> 01:09:43.386
It appears there's a connection...

01:09:43.563 --> 01:09:45.895
...between the Dark Lord's mind and your own.

01:09:46.064 --> 01:09:50.229
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.

01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:53.629
Pray he remains ignorant.

01:09:53.807 --> 01:09:57.072
You mean, if he knows about it, then...

01:09:57.544 --> 01:10:01.948
- ... he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...

01:10:02.115 --> 01:10:03.981
...unhinge it.

01:10:04.151 --> 01:10:07.518
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...

01:10:07.688 --> 01:10:09.918
...to invade the minds of his victims...

01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:13.685
...creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.

01:10:14.828 --> 01:10:19.630
Only after extracting the last
exquisite ounce of agony...

01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:24.066
...only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...

01:10:24.238 --> 01:10:25.466
...kill them.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.873
Used properly, the power of Occlumency...

01:10:29.042 --> 01:10:32.535
...will help shield you
from access or influence.

01:10:32.713 --> 01:10:37.479
In these lessons, I will
attempt to penetrate your mind.

01:10:38.052 --> 01:10:41.146
You will attempt to resist.

01:10:41.422 --> 01:10:42.889
Prepare yourself.

01:10:45.626 --> 01:10:46.854
Legilimens.

01:10:54.969 --> 01:10:58.564
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.

01:11:24.465 --> 01:11:26.093
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

01:11:27.301 --> 01:11:29.964
Here we go.

01:11:30.137 --> 01:11:32.299
Daddy's back.

01:11:35.477 --> 01:11:39.105
Sit down, everybody, sit
down. That's it. Now, presents.

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:43.650
- And a nice big box for Ron.
- Big box for you. And...

01:11:46.454 --> 01:11:48.649
Fred and George. Come on, open up.

01:11:48.823 --> 01:11:51.121
- I want to see your faces.
- Yes.

01:11:51.293 --> 01:11:53.692
- Try it on.
- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.

01:11:53.862 --> 01:11:58.162
- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.

01:11:58.333 --> 01:12:01.200
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.

01:12:01.369 --> 01:12:03.394
Oh, Harry, Harry.

01:12:03.571 --> 01:12:05.471
There you are.

01:12:06.474 --> 01:12:08.305
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.

01:12:08.877 --> 01:12:10.743
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.

01:12:10.913 --> 01:12:12.880
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.

01:12:13.048 --> 01:12:14.777
- Thank you.
- Has everybody got?

01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:16.316
Fred? George?

01:12:16.485 --> 01:12:19.009
- Hermione.
- A Christmas toast.

01:12:19.188 --> 01:12:21.052
To Mr. Harry Potter...

01:12:22.091 --> 01:12:24.924
...without whom I would not be here.

01:12:28.497 --> 01:12:30.829
- Harry.
- Harry.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.227
Harry.

01:12:33.235 --> 01:12:35.828
That is delicious. I shall
be needing some more of that.

01:12:36.004 --> 01:12:38.370
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.

01:12:39.308 --> 01:12:42.038
I can't understand why you
don't want to wear it, Ronald.

01:12:43.511 --> 01:12:45.343
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.

01:12:45.514 --> 01:12:47.345
No more than usual, Ron.

01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:49.380
I don't know why...

01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:59.987
Nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass.

01:13:00.162 --> 01:13:04.895
Harry Potter, the boy
who stopped the Dark Lord.

01:13:05.067 --> 01:13:08.059
Friend of Mudbloods and blood-traitors alike.

01:13:08.504 --> 01:13:11.098
- If my poor mistress only knew...
- Kreacher!

01:13:11.273 --> 01:13:14.106
That's enough of your bile. Away with you!

01:13:14.276 --> 01:13:16.267
Of course, master.

01:13:16.445 --> 01:13:21.144
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.

01:13:23.452 --> 01:13:25.352
Sorry about that.

01:13:25.921 --> 01:13:29.584
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.

01:13:29.926 --> 01:13:32.018
Not to me, anyway.

01:13:32.863 --> 01:13:34.796
What, you grew up here?

01:13:34.964 --> 01:13:37.228
This is my parents' house.

01:13:37.566 --> 01:13:41.401
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.

01:13:42.538 --> 01:13:45.803
About the only useful
thing I've been able to do.

01:13:47.210 --> 01:13:49.576
This is the Black family tree.

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:52.607
My deranged cousin.

01:13:52.783 --> 01:13:55.513
I hated the lot of them.

01:13:55.685 --> 01:14:00.383
My parents with their pure-blood mania.

01:14:03.593 --> 01:14:07.393
My mother did that after I ran away.

01:14:09.733 --> 01:14:11.597
Charming woman.

01:14:12.869 --> 01:14:14.495
I was 16.

01:14:15.338 --> 01:14:16.771
Where did you go?

01:14:18.842 --> 01:14:20.103
Round your dad's.

01:14:21.611 --> 01:14:24.136
I was always welcome at the Potters'.

01:14:25.048 --> 01:14:27.778
I see him so much in you, Harry.

01:14:28.418 --> 01:14:30.613
You are so very much alike.

01:14:31.555 --> 01:14:33.523
I'm not so sure.

01:14:34.592 --> 01:14:36.024
Sirius, when I was...

01:14:38.862 --> 01:14:43.391
When I saw Mr. Weasley
attacked, I wasn't just watching.

01:14:44.534 --> 01:14:46.059
I was the snake.

01:14:46.903 --> 01:14:49.838
And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...

01:14:50.006 --> 01:14:54.204
...there was a moment when I wanted to...

01:14:59.349 --> 01:15:02.216
This connection between me and Voldemort.

01:15:02.887 --> 01:15:06.482
What if the reason for it is
that I am becoming more like him?

01:15:07.824 --> 01:15:12.727
I just feel so angry all the time.

01:15:12.896 --> 01:15:17.459
And what if, after everything
that I've been through...

01:15:17.635 --> 01:15:21.196
...something's gone wrong inside
me? What if I'm becoming bad?

01:15:23.841 --> 01:15:27.072
I want you to listen to
me very carefully, Harry.

01:15:28.279 --> 01:15:31.248
You're not a bad person.

01:15:32.083 --> 01:15:36.451
You're a very good person who
bad things have happened to.

01:15:37.054 --> 01:15:38.180
You understand?

01:15:40.291 --> 01:15:45.319
Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.

01:15:45.496 --> 01:15:49.956
We've all got both light
and dark inside of us.

01:15:50.701 --> 01:15:53.966
What matters is the part we choose to act on.

01:15:55.907 --> 01:15:58.205
That's who we really are.

01:16:01.946 --> 01:16:03.709
Harry, time to go.

01:16:05.483 --> 01:16:09.749
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.

01:16:09.921 --> 01:16:11.513
You'll see.

01:16:12.657 --> 01:16:14.023
Come on.

01:16:51.463 --> 01:16:52.622
Really?

01:16:52.797 --> 01:16:55.425
Harry. Harry.

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.535
Hagrid's back.

01:17:00.472 --> 01:17:02.303
I'm sorry.

01:17:16.521 --> 01:17:19.684
I will say this one last time.

01:17:19.992 --> 01:17:22.358
I'm ordering you to tell me where you've been.

01:17:22.527 --> 01:17:25.553
I told you. I've been away for me health.

01:17:25.897 --> 01:17:30.062
- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.

01:17:30.236 --> 01:17:35.070
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper, fresh
air must be difficult to come by.

01:17:37.109 --> 01:17:39.600
If I were you, I shouldn't
get too used to being back.

01:17:39.778 --> 01:17:43.043
In fact, I mightn't bother unpacking at all.

01:18:02.001 --> 01:18:05.095
This is top-secret, right?

01:18:06.004 --> 01:18:08.371
Dumbledore sent me to parley with the giants.

01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:10.031
Giants?

01:18:11.277 --> 01:18:12.266
You found them?

01:18:12.445 --> 01:18:16.347
Well, they're not that hard to find, to
be perfectly honest. They're so big, see?

01:18:17.216 --> 01:18:20.241
I tried to convince them to join the cause.

01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:23.117
But I wasn't the only one that
was trying to win them over.

01:18:23.823 --> 01:18:25.723
- Death Eaters?
- Yes.

01:18:26.192 --> 01:18:29.525
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.

01:18:30.029 --> 01:18:32.395
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.

01:18:32.565 --> 01:18:36.661
Suppose some of them remember he
was friendly to them. I suppose.

01:18:40.274 --> 01:18:41.570
And they did this to you?

01:18:42.275 --> 01:18:44.038
Not exactly, no.

01:18:44.544 --> 01:18:48.446
Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog.

01:19:02.428 --> 01:19:04.555
It's changing out there.

01:19:04.997 --> 01:19:06.556
Just like last time.

01:19:08.034 --> 01:19:09.662
There's a storm coming, Harry.

01:19:10.403 --> 01:19:13.463
We'd all best be ready when she does.

01:19:50.477 --> 01:19:53.504
We have confirmed that 10
high-security prisoners...

01:19:53.681 --> 01:19:56.514
...in the early hours of
yesterday evening did escape.

01:19:56.684 --> 01:20:00.346
And of course, the Muggle prime
minister has been alerted to the danger.

01:20:00.521 --> 01:20:02.615
We strongly suspect...

01:20:03.457 --> 01:20:05.449
...that the breakout was engineered...

01:20:05.627 --> 01:20:09.824
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...

01:20:09.997 --> 01:20:14.230
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...

01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:20.039
...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.

01:20:30.351 --> 01:20:32.648
Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen.

01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:35.984
He's gonna get us all killed just
because he can't face the truth.

01:20:36.157 --> 01:20:37.283
Harry.

01:20:40.994 --> 01:20:42.986
I wanted to apologize.

01:20:43.598 --> 01:20:47.762
Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.

01:20:47.936 --> 01:20:53.841
So, what I'm really trying
to say is that I believe you.

01:21:00.782 --> 01:21:02.374
Neville?

01:21:14.963 --> 01:21:17.090
Fourteen years ago...

01:21:17.265 --> 01:21:21.532
...a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange...

01:21:21.704 --> 01:21:24.900
...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.

01:21:25.473 --> 01:21:29.433
She tortured them for information...

01:21:29.612 --> 01:21:31.772
...but they never gave in.

01:21:33.449 --> 01:21:35.940
I'm quite proud to be their son.

01:21:36.918 --> 01:21:40.787
But I'm not sure I'm ready
for everyone to know just yet.

01:21:46.729 --> 01:21:50.859
We're gonna make them proud,
Neville. That's a promise.

01:21:55.104 --> 01:21:58.801
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.

01:21:58.974 --> 01:22:02.410
Allow it to fill you up. Keep trying, Seamus.

01:22:02.578 --> 01:22:03.977
George, your turn now.

01:22:05.347 --> 01:22:07.645
Expecto Patronum.

01:22:08.584 --> 01:22:12.020
A full-bodied Patronus is the
most difficult to produce...

01:22:12.187 --> 01:22:16.021
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.

01:22:16.191 --> 01:22:17.420
Wow, that was really good.

01:22:18.127 --> 01:22:19.685
Fantastic, Ginny.

01:22:19.862 --> 01:22:23.889
Just remember, your Patronus can only
protect you for as long as you stay focused.

01:22:24.066 --> 01:22:26.365
So focus, Luna.

01:22:30.072 --> 01:22:31.768
Think of the happiest thing you can.

01:22:31.942 --> 01:22:33.909
Expecto Patronum.

01:22:34.076 --> 01:22:36.943
- I'm trying.
- I know. It's good.

01:22:37.113 --> 01:22:41.378
This is really advanced stuff,
guys. You're doing so well.

01:22:42.117 --> 01:22:44.517
Expecto Patronum.

01:23:26.363 --> 01:23:28.888
I'll make short work of this.

01:23:30.233 --> 01:23:32.224
Bombarda Maxima.

01:23:50.521 --> 01:23:51.885
Get them.

01:23:52.322 --> 01:23:53.790
Been watching them for weeks.

01:23:53.958 --> 01:23:55.891
And see, " Dumbledore's Army"...

01:23:56.327 --> 01:24:00.024
...proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.

01:24:01.398 --> 01:24:03.457
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...

01:24:03.633 --> 01:24:05.158
...never fooled us for a minute.

01:24:05.336 --> 01:24:07.395
We saw your lies for what they were:

01:24:07.571 --> 01:24:11.405
A smokescreen for your bid to
seize control of the Ministry.

01:24:11.575 --> 01:24:12.563
Naturally.

01:24:12.742 --> 01:24:15.267
No, professor. He had nothing
to do with it. It was me.

01:24:15.445 --> 01:24:19.109
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield
me, but as has been pointed out...

01:24:19.283 --> 01:24:24.117
...the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."

01:24:24.287 --> 01:24:26.915
I instructed Harry to form this organization.

01:24:27.090 --> 01:24:30.549
And I, and I alone, am
responsible for its activities.

01:24:30.728 --> 01:24:32.558
Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.

01:24:32.729 --> 01:24:35.255
If we hurry, we should still
make the morning edition.

01:24:35.432 --> 01:24:40.234
Dawlish, Shacklebolt, you
will escort Dumbledore...

01:24:40.404 --> 01:24:41.837
...to Azkaban...

01:24:43.074 --> 01:24:48.239
...to await trial for conspiracy and sedition.

01:24:48.412 --> 01:24:51.347
I thought we might hit this little snag.

01:24:52.516 --> 01:24:55.952
You seem to be laboring under
the delusion that I'm going to...

01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:57.953
What was the phrase?

01:24:58.122 --> 01:24:59.714
...come quietly.

01:24:59.890 --> 01:25:01.586
Well, I can tell you this:

01:25:02.026 --> 01:25:04.325
I have no intention of going to Azkaban.

01:25:04.496 --> 01:25:05.757
Enough of this.

01:25:06.263 --> 01:25:07.356
Take him.

01:25:20.211 --> 01:25:24.581
Well, you may not like him, minister...

01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:26.877
...but you can't deny...

01:25:27.419 --> 01:25:30.149
...Dumbledore has got style.

01:25:54.246 --> 01:25:58.876
Boys and girls are not permitted to
be within eight inches of each other.

01:25:59.050 --> 01:26:02.486
Those wishing to join the
Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

01:26:02.654 --> 01:26:07.682
Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.

01:26:07.859 --> 01:26:12.159
Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.

01:27:23.369 --> 01:27:24.962
Harry.

01:27:31.911 --> 01:27:35.312
You did everything you could. No
one could win against that old hag.

01:27:35.481 --> 01:27:37.847
Even Dumbledore didn't see this coming.

01:27:38.751 --> 01:27:40.912
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.

01:27:41.087 --> 01:27:43.180
Yeah, we talked you into it.

01:27:43.356 --> 01:27:45.325
Yeah, but I agreed.

01:27:45.892 --> 01:27:50.022
I tried so hard to help, and all
it's done is make things worse.

01:27:52.064 --> 01:27:54.499
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.

01:27:55.568 --> 01:27:59.767
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.

01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:02.602
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.

01:28:02.776 --> 01:28:05.939
- So maybe it's just better to...
- To what?

01:28:08.181 --> 01:28:10.115
To go it alone.

01:28:16.456 --> 01:28:18.116
Hagrid.

01:28:21.862 --> 01:28:24.296
Any idea where he's taking us?

01:28:24.464 --> 01:28:27.524
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?

01:28:35.842 --> 01:28:38.505
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.

01:28:38.679 --> 01:28:41.240
And they're dangerous at the best of times.

01:28:42.182 --> 01:28:44.514
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...

01:28:44.685 --> 01:28:46.881
...they'll have a full
uprising on their hands.

01:28:47.055 --> 01:28:48.715
Hagrid, what's going on?

01:28:48.889 --> 01:28:51.119
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.

01:28:51.291 --> 01:28:56.251
I wouldn't be bothering you at all
with it, but with Dumbledore gone...

01:28:56.897 --> 01:29:00.060
...I'll likely be getting
the sack any day now.

01:29:00.233 --> 01:29:03.726
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.

01:29:07.941 --> 01:29:09.569
Grawpy.

01:29:11.979 --> 01:29:14.072
Down here, you great buffoon.

01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:22.116
Grawpy.

01:29:22.889 --> 01:29:24.585
Brought you some company.

01:29:36.938 --> 01:29:39.202
I couldn't just leave him, because...

01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:41.103
Because he's my brother.

01:29:41.275 --> 01:29:42.401
Blimey.

01:29:42.577 --> 01:29:44.602
Well, half brother, really.

01:29:44.779 --> 01:29:50.046
He's completely harmless, just like
I said. Little high-spirited, is all.

01:29:52.186 --> 01:29:54.519
- Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.

01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:57.089
We talked about this. You do not grab, do you?

01:29:57.258 --> 01:29:59.522
That's your new friend, Hermione.

01:29:59.694 --> 01:30:00.991
Grawpy.

01:30:05.299 --> 01:30:06.493
Grawp.

01:30:08.536 --> 01:30:11.597
Put me down.

01:30:15.276 --> 01:30:16.834
Now.

01:30:28.991 --> 01:30:30.082
You all right?

01:30:31.393 --> 01:30:33.053
Fine.

01:30:33.461 --> 01:30:35.760
Just needs a firm hand, is all.

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:38.331
I think you've got an admirer.

01:30:40.836 --> 01:30:42.997
You just stay away from her, all right?

01:31:13.135 --> 01:31:15.865
He gets his own food and all.

01:31:17.139 --> 01:31:20.199
It's company he'll be needing when I'm gone.

01:31:21.543 --> 01:31:23.773
You will look after him, won't you?

01:31:24.279 --> 01:31:26.975
I'm the only family he's got.

01:31:40.562 --> 01:31:42.428
Feeling sentimental?

01:31:45.702 --> 01:31:49.535
- That's private.
- Not to me.

01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:53.331
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.

01:31:55.777 --> 01:31:58.941
Every memory he has access to is
a weapon he can use against you.

01:31:59.115 --> 01:32:03.245
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.

01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:06.683
You're just like your father.

01:32:06.855 --> 01:32:08.653
Lazy, arrogant.

01:32:08.825 --> 01:32:11.055
- Don't say a word against my father.
- Weak.

01:32:11.227 --> 01:32:13.388
- I'm not weak.
- Then prove it.

01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:15.964
Control your emotions.

01:32:16.132 --> 01:32:19.067
Discipline your mind.

01:32:21.905 --> 01:32:23.099
Legilimens.

01:32:30.313 --> 01:32:31.405
Harry.

01:32:31.581 --> 01:32:33.310
Sirius.

01:32:33.983 --> 01:32:35.315
I may vomit.

01:32:35.619 --> 01:32:36.642
Stop it.

01:32:37.787 --> 01:32:40.085
Is this what you call control?

01:32:40.590 --> 01:32:43.650
We've been at it for
hours. If I could just rest.

01:32:43.827 --> 01:32:47.228
The Dark Lord isn't resting.

01:32:48.865 --> 01:32:50.765
You and Black, you're two of a kind.

01:32:50.934 --> 01:32:54.893
Sentimental children forever whining about
how bitterly unfair your lives have been.

01:32:55.072 --> 01:32:58.439
Well, it may have escaped your
notice, but life isn't fair.

01:32:58.609 --> 01:33:02.567
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.

01:33:02.745 --> 01:33:05.771
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.

01:33:06.817 --> 01:33:08.306
- Legilimens.
- Protego.

01:33:13.891 --> 01:33:15.415
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.

01:33:15.593 --> 01:33:17.652
Snape. Expelliarmus.

01:33:17.828 --> 01:33:19.659
Nice one, James.

01:33:20.029 --> 01:33:22.328
- Dad.
- Impedimenta.

01:33:22.499 --> 01:33:24.490
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.

01:33:24.668 --> 01:33:27.330
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?

01:33:27.504 --> 01:33:29.768
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.

01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:31.134
Enough.

01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:34.702
Enough.

01:33:43.221 --> 01:33:45.814
Your lessons are at an end.

01:33:45.991 --> 01:33:47.116
I...

01:33:47.291 --> 01:33:50.556
Get out.

01:34:07.778 --> 01:34:09.939
- What's your name?
- Michael.

01:34:10.114 --> 01:34:12.015
Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.

01:34:12.183 --> 01:34:15.209
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?

01:34:15.387 --> 01:34:17.412
It's fading already.

01:34:17.589 --> 01:34:22.321
You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.

01:34:29.701 --> 01:34:32.431
As I told you once before, Mr. Potter...

01:34:32.604 --> 01:34:36.369
...naughty children deserve to be punished.

01:34:39.443 --> 01:34:40.775
You know, George...

01:34:40.945 --> 01:34:44.608
...I've always felt our futures lay
outside the world of academic achievement.

01:34:44.783 --> 01:34:49.345
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.

01:36:01.292 --> 01:36:02.954
All right, professor!

01:36:11.737 --> 01:36:13.500
Here you go.

01:36:38.465 --> 01:36:40.295
Ready when you are.

01:38:06.053 --> 01:38:09.318
I need that prophecy.

01:38:09.490 --> 01:38:11.287
You'll have to kill me.

01:38:12.159 --> 01:38:16.720
Oh, I will. But first,
you will fetch it for me.

01:38:16.898 --> 01:38:18.593
Crucio.

01:38:21.135 --> 01:38:22.898
Crucio.

01:38:34.282 --> 01:38:35.749
Sirius.

01:38:35.917 --> 01:38:36.906
Harry, are you sure?

01:38:37.084 --> 01:38:39.552
I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley.

01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:41.585
It's the door I've been dreaming about.

01:38:41.756 --> 01:38:43.815
I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before.

01:38:43.991 --> 01:38:45.925
Sirius said Voldemort was after something.

01:38:46.093 --> 01:38:49.392
Something he didn't have the last
time, in the Department of Mysteries.

01:38:49.564 --> 01:38:51.498
Harry, please, just listen.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.991
What if Voldemort meant for you to see this?

01:38:56.305 --> 01:38:59.433
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?

01:38:59.608 --> 01:39:03.099
What if he is? I'm supposed
to just let him die?

01:39:03.277 --> 01:39:06.769
Hermione, he's the only family I've got left.

01:39:09.383 --> 01:39:10.373
What do we do?

01:39:11.786 --> 01:39:13.414
We'll have to use the Floo Network.

01:39:13.589 --> 01:39:15.647
Umbridge has the chimneys under surveillance.

01:39:15.823 --> 01:39:17.381
Not all of them.

01:39:20.195 --> 01:39:21.525
Alohomora.

01:39:32.773 --> 01:39:34.469
Alert the Order if you can.

01:39:34.643 --> 01:39:38.203
- Are you mental? We're going with you.
- It's too dangerous.

01:39:38.379 --> 01:39:42.009
When are you going to get it into
your head? We're in this together.

01:39:42.184 --> 01:39:45.415
That you are.

01:39:45.587 --> 01:39:48.454
Caught this one trying
to help the Weasley girl.

01:39:53.462 --> 01:39:55.555
You were going to Dumbledore, weren't you?

01:39:55.731 --> 01:39:57.756
- No.
- Liar.

01:39:57.933 --> 01:40:00.766
- You sent for me, headmistress?
- Snape, yes.

01:40:00.936 --> 01:40:04.394
The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.

01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:06.364
Have you brought the Veritaserum?

01:40:06.541 --> 01:40:09.442
I'm afraid you've used up all
my stores interrogating students.

01:40:09.611 --> 01:40:12.740
The last of it on Miss Chang.

01:40:16.818 --> 01:40:18.286
Unless you wish to poison him...

01:40:18.454 --> 01:40:22.890
And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.

01:40:23.492 --> 01:40:25.426
...I cannot help you.

01:40:27.863 --> 01:40:29.559
He's got Padfoot.

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:34.091
He's got Padfoot at the
place where it's hidden.

01:40:34.569 --> 01:40:36.696
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?

01:40:36.872 --> 01:40:38.397
What is he talking about, Snape?

01:40:45.081 --> 01:40:47.072
No idea.

01:40:51.586 --> 01:40:53.145
Very well.

01:40:54.156 --> 01:40:56.489
You give me no choice, Potter.

01:40:56.859 --> 01:40:59.828
As this is an issue of Ministry security...

01:40:59.995 --> 01:41:02.055
...you leave me with...

01:41:02.799 --> 01:41:04.767
...no alternative.

01:41:05.568 --> 01:41:07.763
The Cruciatus Curse ought
to loosen your tongue.

01:41:07.937 --> 01:41:08.926
That's illegal.

01:41:09.105 --> 01:41:12.472
What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him.

01:41:19.982 --> 01:41:21.506
Tell her, Harry!

01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:24.452
Tell me what?

01:41:25.655 --> 01:41:27.646
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...

01:41:28.324 --> 01:41:30.087
...I will.

01:41:31.729 --> 01:41:33.525
Where what is?

01:41:34.732 --> 01:41:37.029
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

01:41:42.038 --> 01:41:43.563
How much further?

01:41:43.741 --> 01:41:45.401
Not far.

01:41:47.410 --> 01:41:51.107
It had to be somewhere students
wouldn't find it accidentally.

01:41:55.452 --> 01:41:56.919
What are you doing?

01:41:57.087 --> 01:41:58.883
Improvising.

01:42:07.396 --> 01:42:08.989
Well?

01:42:10.299 --> 01:42:12.427
Where is this weapon?

01:42:17.341 --> 01:42:19.605
There isn't one, is there?

01:42:22.379 --> 01:42:24.540
You were trying to trick me.

01:42:28.752 --> 01:42:30.310
You know...

01:42:31.722 --> 01:42:33.747
...I really hate children.

01:42:49.339 --> 01:42:53.777
You have no business here,
centaur. This is a Ministry matter.

01:42:56.447 --> 01:42:58.107
Lower your weapons.

01:42:58.282 --> 01:43:03.811
I warn you, under the law, as
creatures of near-human intelligence...

01:43:03.987 --> 01:43:05.216
Protego.

01:43:05.490 --> 01:43:06.615
How dare you?

01:43:07.257 --> 01:43:08.782
Filthy half-breed.

01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:10.550
Incarcerous.

01:43:23.774 --> 01:43:26.369
Please. Please stop it. Please.

01:43:26.543 --> 01:43:31.208
Now, enough. I will have order.

01:43:40.058 --> 01:43:42.618
You filthy animal.

01:43:42.794 --> 01:43:45.763
Do you know who I am?

01:43:45.930 --> 01:43:48.763
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.

01:43:48.933 --> 01:43:50.798
No, he doesn't understand.

01:43:58.477 --> 01:44:01.934
Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.

01:44:02.113 --> 01:44:04.048
I'm sorry, professor.

01:44:04.216 --> 01:44:06.012
But I must not tell lies.

01:44:06.184 --> 01:44:07.174
What are you doing?

01:44:07.353 --> 01:44:11.186
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.

01:44:11.656 --> 01:44:13.851
Let me go!

01:44:16.527 --> 01:44:18.325
Thank you, Grawp.

01:44:18.497 --> 01:44:21.989
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.

01:44:30.273 --> 01:44:33.834
- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.

01:44:34.009 --> 01:44:36.137
Told them I was hungry, wanted some sweets.

01:44:36.312 --> 01:44:38.872
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.

01:44:39.715 --> 01:44:41.206
That was clever, Ron.

01:44:42.051 --> 01:44:44.542
- Has been known to happen.
- It was brilliant.

01:44:44.721 --> 01:44:46.518
So how are we getting to London?

01:44:47.890 --> 01:44:51.417
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...

01:44:52.261 --> 01:44:54.957
...but I've got you into
enough trouble as it is.

01:44:55.131 --> 01:44:58.100
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to
be about doing something real.

01:44:58.434 --> 01:45:00.561
Or was that all just words to you?

01:45:02.438 --> 01:45:05.635
Maybe you don't have to do
this all by yourself, mate.

01:45:10.546 --> 01:45:12.707
So how are we going to get to London?

01:45:14.117 --> 01:45:16.347
We fly, of course.

01:46:07.404 --> 01:46:09.565
Department of Mysteries.

01:46:18.415 --> 01:46:20.110
This is it.

01:47:13.104 --> 01:47:15.435
Ninety-two.
Ninety-three.

01:47:17.141 --> 01:47:18.505
Ninety-four.

01:47:19.777 --> 01:47:20.801
Ninety-five.

01:47:33.358 --> 01:47:36.122
- He should be here.
- Harry.

01:47:38.830 --> 01:47:40.127
It's got your name on it.

01:48:05.323 --> 01:48:09.693
The one with the power to
vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.

01:48:10.529 --> 01:48:12.963
And the Dark Lord shall
mark him as his equal...

01:48:13.132 --> 01:48:15.930
...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.

01:48:21.573 --> 01:48:26.943
For neither can live while the other survives.

01:48:29.448 --> 01:48:30.540
Harry.

01:48:41.026 --> 01:48:42.516
Where's Sirius?

01:48:42.695 --> 01:48:47.792
You know, you really should learn to
tell the difference between dreams...

01:48:50.703 --> 01:48:52.864
...and reality.

01:48:54.139 --> 01:48:59.076
You saw only what the Dark
Lord wanted you to see.

01:48:59.778 --> 01:49:01.268
Now, hand me the prophecy.

01:49:01.447 --> 01:49:03.540
If you do anything to us, I'll break it.

01:49:06.319 --> 01:49:08.879
He knows how to play.

01:49:09.055 --> 01:49:12.854
Itty, bitty baby.

01:49:13.025 --> 01:49:14.254
Potter.

01:49:14.794 --> 01:49:16.693
Bellatrix Lestrange.

01:49:16.862 --> 01:49:19.797
Neville Longbottom, is it? How's Mum and Dad?

01:49:19.966 --> 01:49:21.830
Better, now they're about to be avenged.

01:49:24.670 --> 01:49:29.472
Now, let's everybody just calm down...

01:49:29.942 --> 01:49:31.433
...shall we?

01:49:31.611 --> 01:49:34.079
All we want is that prophecy.

01:49:34.247 --> 01:49:36.441
Why did Voldemort need
me to come and get this?

01:49:36.615 --> 01:49:38.243
You dare speak his name?

01:49:39.786 --> 01:49:41.378
You filthy half-blood!

01:49:41.553 --> 01:49:44.148
It's all right. He's just
a curious lad, aren't you?

01:49:46.092 --> 01:49:51.553
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.

01:49:51.731 --> 01:49:54.461
Which is lucky for you, really.

01:49:58.238 --> 01:50:00.172
Haven't you always wondered...

01:50:00.673 --> 01:50:05.872
...what was the reason for the
connection between you and the Dark Lord?

01:50:06.613 --> 01:50:09.104
Why he was unable to kill you...

01:50:09.282 --> 01:50:11.807
...when you were just an infant?

01:50:13.186 --> 01:50:17.987
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?

01:50:18.925 --> 01:50:23.328
All the answers are there,
Potter, in your hand.

01:50:24.531 --> 01:50:26.522
All you have to do...

01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:29.034
...is give it to me.

01:50:29.335 --> 01:50:32.634
Then I can show you everything.

01:50:41.381 --> 01:50:43.178
I've waited 14 years.

01:50:43.783 --> 01:50:45.081
I know.

01:50:46.386 --> 01:50:49.321
I guess I can wait a
little longer. Now. Stupefy.

01:50:49.489 --> 01:50:50.923
Stupefy.

01:51:07.073 --> 01:51:08.063
Levicorpus.

01:51:14.615 --> 01:51:16.640
Petrificus Totalus.

01:51:16.817 --> 01:51:18.614
Well done, Neville.

01:51:27.061 --> 01:51:28.619
Stupefy.

01:51:30.364 --> 01:51:31.592
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

01:51:42.743 --> 01:51:44.643
Stupefy.

01:51:52.186 --> 01:51:54.484
Reducto.

01:52:10.505 --> 01:52:12.598
Get back to the door.

01:52:47.909 --> 01:52:52.403
Department of Mysteries. They
got that bit right, didn't they?

01:52:57.620 --> 01:52:59.519
The voices.

01:53:00.089 --> 01:53:02.113
Can you tell what they're saying?

01:53:03.792 --> 01:53:05.954
There aren't any voices, Harry.

01:53:06.695 --> 01:53:08.459
Let's get out of here.

01:53:08.631 --> 01:53:10.222
I hear them too.

01:53:13.335 --> 01:53:15.963
Harry, it's just an empty archway.

01:53:18.740 --> 01:53:20.140
Please, Harry.

01:53:20.910 --> 01:53:22.775
Get behind me.

01:54:09.325 --> 01:54:12.021
Did you actually believe...

01:54:12.194 --> 01:54:16.791
...or were you truly naive enough to think...

01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:22.532
...that children stood a chance against us?

01:54:26.042 --> 01:54:29.773
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.

01:54:33.483 --> 01:54:36.816
Give me the prophecy now...

01:54:36.987 --> 01:54:40.979
...or watch your friends die.

01:54:53.904 --> 01:54:55.302
Don't give it to him, Harry.

01:55:21.598 --> 01:55:24.363
Get away from my godson.

01:55:54.464 --> 01:55:57.058
Now, listen to me. Take the
others and get out of here.

01:55:57.401 --> 01:55:59.233
What? No, I'm staying with you.

01:55:59.404 --> 01:56:02.237
You've done beautifully.

01:56:02.873 --> 01:56:04.535
Now, let me take it from here.

01:56:04.709 --> 01:56:05.697
Black.

01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:34.201
Expelliarmus!

01:56:34.372 --> 01:56:35.703
Nice one, James.

01:56:42.948 --> 01:56:44.414
Avada Kedavra.

01:57:04.635 --> 01:57:06.934
No. No.

01:57:30.896 --> 01:57:33.557
I killed Sirius Black.

01:57:34.533 --> 01:57:36.500
- You coming to get me?
- Crucio.

01:57:48.847 --> 01:57:51.975
You've got to mean it, Harry.

01:57:52.150 --> 01:57:55.916
She killed him. She deserves it.

01:57:59.758 --> 01:58:02.955
You know the spell, Harry.

01:58:14.506 --> 01:58:16.134
Do it.

01:58:23.815 --> 01:58:26.784
So weak.

01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:36.757
It was foolish of you to
come here tonight, T om.

01:58:36.930 --> 01:58:38.659
The Aurors are on their way.

01:58:38.831 --> 01:58:43.029
By which time I shall be gone, and you...

01:58:44.571 --> 01:58:46.663
...shall be dead.

02:01:00.975 --> 02:01:02.875
You've lost, old man.

02:01:23.031 --> 02:01:24.020
Harry.

02:01:28.169 --> 02:01:29.659
So weak.

02:01:30.171 --> 02:01:32.401
So vulnerable.

02:01:36.711 --> 02:01:37.700
Look at me.

02:01:40.248 --> 02:01:44.480
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.

02:01:44.652 --> 02:01:47.143
It's how you are not.

02:01:52.093 --> 02:01:53.584
Harry?

02:02:25.995 --> 02:02:27.462
You're the weak one...

02:02:28.063 --> 02:02:32.193
...and you'll never know love or friendship.

02:02:35.603 --> 02:02:38.505
And I feel sorry for you.

02:03:01.564 --> 02:03:05.022
You're a fool, Harry Potter.

02:03:05.968 --> 02:03:11.099
And you will lose everything.

02:03:26.055 --> 02:03:27.717
He's back.

02:04:35.458 --> 02:04:37.120
I know how you feel, Harry.

02:04:37.295 --> 02:04:38.886
No, you don't.

02:04:44.534 --> 02:04:45.934
It's my fault.

02:04:46.103 --> 02:04:49.368
No, the fault is mine.

02:04:50.373 --> 02:04:52.137
I knew it was only a matter of time...

02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:55.370
...before Voldemort made
the connection between you.

02:04:56.179 --> 02:05:00.446
I thought by distancing myself
from you, as I have done all year...

02:05:00.618 --> 02:05:05.851
...he'd be less tempted, and
therefore you might be more protected.

02:05:08.659 --> 02:05:11.992
The prophecy said:

02:05:12.596 --> 02:05:16.555
"Neither one can live while
the other one survives."

02:05:17.902 --> 02:05:23.966
It means one of us is gonna have
to kill the other, in the end.

02:05:25.977 --> 02:05:27.535
Yes.

02:05:28.013 --> 02:05:29.570
Why didn't you tell me?

02:05:29.747 --> 02:05:33.342
For the same reason you tried to save Sirius.

02:05:33.518 --> 02:05:35.951
The same reason your friends saved you.

02:05:36.788 --> 02:05:40.314
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...

02:05:40.491 --> 02:05:43.392
...I didn't want to cause you any more pain.

02:05:44.863 --> 02:05:46.989
I cared too much about you.

02:06:11.857 --> 02:06:14.155
How come you're not at the feast?

02:06:14.326 --> 02:06:18.888
Lost all my possessions. Apparently
people have been hiding them.

02:06:19.064 --> 02:06:20.053
That's awful.

02:06:20.232 --> 02:06:22.132
Oh, it's all good fun.

02:06:22.300 --> 02:06:25.758
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.

02:06:25.937 --> 02:06:28.303
Do you want any help finding them?

02:06:31.209 --> 02:06:34.406
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.

02:06:41.453 --> 02:06:43.512
Are you sure you don't want any help looking?

02:06:43.688 --> 02:06:45.349
That's all right.

02:06:45.524 --> 02:06:47.685
Anyway, my mum always said...

02:06:47.859 --> 02:06:51.727
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.

02:06:54.966 --> 02:06:58.232
If not always in the way we expect.

02:06:59.738 --> 02:07:02.434
Think I'll just go have some pudding.

02:07:38.111 --> 02:07:41.012
I've been thinking about
something Dumbledore said to me.

02:07:41.180 --> 02:07:42.874
What's that?

02:07:43.483 --> 02:07:46.247
That even though we've
got a fight ahead of us...

02:07:46.419 --> 02:07:49.513
...we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.

02:07:49.689 --> 02:07:51.179
Yeah?

02:07:53.092 --> 02:07:55.458
Something worth fighting for.
