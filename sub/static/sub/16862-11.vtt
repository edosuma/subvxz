00:00.080 --> 00:01.520
Previously on rescue me...

00:01.550 --> 00:04.680
Why is he here?
Why is he here?

00:04.730 --> 00:06.840
No,no,he is not an alcoholic!

00:06.890 --> 00:09.310
Who votes that sean does not get to come to these meetings anymore?

00:09.340 --> 00:10.300
Whoa,hold on.

00:10.340 --> 00:12.320
Well,you know what,who votes that I get to stay?

00:12.800 --> 00:15.540
Feinberg's been making a lot of noises about you lately.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.460
Like transfer noises.

00:17.490 --> 00:19.420
The guy thinks you're a nut,he thinks you're unstable,

00:19.470 --> 00:21.000
but what he's really pissed at is the whole

00:21.050 --> 00:22.630
daughter not getting touched thing.

00:22.670 --> 00:25.460
- The daughter is completely-
- I know,she's completely insane.

00:25.500 --> 00:26.630
She's completely crazy.

00:26.680 --> 00:28.380
It's a problem we can easily fix,all right?

00:28.430 --> 00:29.140
How?

00:29.180 --> 00:31.660
You take her out one more time,ok?

00:31.700 --> 00:34.910
You pour her like 2 or 3 drinks in her,and you cop a feel.

00:34.950 --> 00:37.450
Is nat all right?Whatever it is,you can tell me.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.230
She has a new boyfriend.

00:39.270 --> 00:41.700
We just broke up 4 goddamn days ago,richard.

00:42.260 --> 00:43.990
Oh,this is bullshit,man.

00:44.030 --> 00:46.670
Next time they have a date,I could show you where.

00:46.700 --> 00:48.120
You busy tonight?

00:48.150 --> 00:51.570
No,I'm-I'm-I'm workin' at the firehouse. Why?

00:51.610 --> 00:53.200
Literally?

00:53.230 --> 00:55.010
I only need you for about 3 minutes.

00:55.050 --> 00:56.470
Yeah,well,I know.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.450
I'm gonna go get her number.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.620
- Latrina.
- Latrina. Lovely.

01:05.970 --> 01:07.040
Ken.

01:07.060 --> 01:09.290
- You take it black?
- I don'T.

01:09.330 --> 01:10.840
He's kind of banging this waitress now

01:10.880 --> 01:13.770
and I think that it might be like,you know,a regular thing.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.170
What?!

01:15.210 --> 01:16.460
- Revenge sex.
- No.

01:16.490 --> 01:17.810
- You're thinking of having revenge sex.
- No!

01:17.850 --> 01:19.200
Oh,you're gonna lie to me about that now?

01:19.240 --> 01:22.100
If I was thinking about having revenge sex,may god strike me down.

01:22.140 --> 01:24.290
- Yeah,well,guess what.
- What are you pushin' me for?!

01:24.330 --> 01:28.390
Tell me where mom is,and,um-

01:28.420 --> 01:29.390
'cause I need to talk to her,

01:29.430 --> 01:32.400
and you let me have the baby a couple days a week.

01:32.430 --> 01:34.890
- What?
- I'll give you a brand new car.

01:34.930 --> 01:36.200
Now we're talking.

01:36.300 --> 01:39.250
Hail mary,mother of god,

01:39.300 --> 01:45.380
pray for our sinners,now and at the hour of our death.

01:45.410 --> 01:47.200
You all right?

01:48.310 --> 01:49.950
- You ready?
- Yeah!

01:50.890 --> 01:52.300
You got it?

01:58.320 --> 02:01.270
Come on. You're in,you're in,you're in!

02:01.430 --> 02:03.900
Oh!Thank you!

02:04.920 --> 02:06.630
- Ok,let's go inside now.
- Shit.

02:21.890 --> 02:24.790
The blaze was apparently started by a lit cigarette,

02:24.830 --> 02:28.470
and it quickly spread all over this overcrowded apartment building.

02:28.510 --> 02:31.950
The 3 alarm blaze was called in about 7:15 this morning

02:31.980 --> 02:34.030
and firefighters have been here on scene

02:34.080 --> 02:35.910
trying to contain it ever since.

02:35.950 --> 02:37.410
Right now we are being told that

02:37.470 --> 02:40.870
the number of confirmed fatalities has risen to 6.

02:40.910 --> 02:42.770
That is 6 confirmed deaths.

02:42.810 --> 02:46.060
This is in addition to the 3 firefighters we reported on earlier.

02:46.090 --> 02:49.760
I'm standing at what must be at least 30 yards from the scene here,

02:49.810 --> 02:52.240
and you can literally feel the billows of heat coming from this blaze.

02:52.270 --> 02:56.870
No way out for residents and firefighters.

02:57.040 --> 03:01.400
That's 6 firefighters now that have lost their lives fighting this horrific blaze.

03:01.460 --> 03:04.690
You can see the desperation on the faces of these men...

03:04.720 --> 03:08.350
Well over an hour now and shows no signs of letting up.

03:08.390 --> 03:11.630
The blaze was started by a lit cigarette left on a windowsill

03:11.670 --> 03:13.660
and quickly spread throughout the building.

03:13.700 --> 03:16.780
We're receiving reports that the list of casualties has now risen to 9.

03:16.820 --> 03:20.560
That's 3 residents,and 6 new york city firefighters

03:20.620 --> 03:22.770
whose names have yet to be released.

03:35.550 --> 03:38.210
Whoa,whoa,whoa.
Wait.

03:38.240 --> 03:39.600
Get out of the way,asshole.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.250

05:19.780 --> 05:21.550
Ok. Actually,it's funny that you mention it.

05:21.590 --> 05:23.360
I'm actually hurtin'.

05:23.390 --> 05:25.230
I drank like a fish last night.

05:25.270 --> 05:26.910

As far as the city's concerned,this thing was never even here.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.820

08:34.490 --> 08:35.960

Are you sure it doesn't bite?

08:44.710 --> 08:47.130

09:08.030 --> 09:11.910
Chocolate pizza with melted marshmallows on top.

09:11.940 --> 09:14.640
Now that is true talent.

09:14.670 --> 09:16.930
It's an old family recipe.

09:16.950 --> 09:19.830
It's got chocolate,marshmallow,and pizza.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.080
It's 3 of your cousin's favorite things.

09:22.620 --> 09:24.940
They were my favorite things first.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.580
Oh!

09:39.140 --> 09:41.560
- Oh...

09:41.600 --> 09:43.740

Oh!

09:49.550 --> 09:50.820
Yeah!

There he is again!

09:54.400 --> 09:56.180

This is like the safest vehicle on the road,ok?It's a jetta.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.660
"Safe. " "Safe," that's what it means.

10:04.750 --> 10:06.370
I got you the most modern car seat,

10:06.410 --> 10:09.050

10:09.080 --> 10:10.260
You know?

10:10.290 --> 10:12.450
He's getting all stubborn again.

10:12.470 --> 10:13.900
He kept me up all night last night.

10:13.940 --> 10:17.600
And I can't find a babysitter,so I had to miss tony's gig.

10:17.640 --> 10:19.770
Yeah,well,welcome to baby land.
This is what it's like.

10:19.810 --> 10:20.690
You're finally learning.

10:20.730 --> 10:22.630
You're not ready,ok?

10:23.020 --> 10:24.720
My own kid will be completely different.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.530
Oh,really?
How's that?

10:26.570 --> 10:28.680
Because I will actually be in love with my own baby.

10:28.710 --> 10:30.800
Oh,right,right.
Love.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.210
That's right,I forgot you're an expert on love.

10:32.260 --> 10:33.290
Like you know.

10:33.330 --> 10:35.690
- Like you're an expert on love.
- I do know. I am an expert on love.

10:35.740 --> 10:37.370

10:40.440 --> 10:42.560
You think you're in love,but one of these days,

10:42.590 --> 10:44.190
the two of you are gonna wake up,and one of yous,

10:44.210 --> 10:45.400

10:46.540 --> 10:48.150

Ok,well,you met mom in high school when she was 16!

10:54.920 --> 10:56.370
Ok,but you know what?

We didn't start havin',uh,sex,until,

11:00.240 --> 11:01.880

11:01.910 --> 11:04.600
She was pregnant with me before she even graduated!

11:04.640 --> 11:08.410
Right. We fell in love,and then we had sex.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.440
That's how it happened.
It was real love.

11:10.480 --> 11:14.280
It wasn't this fake,baby had lead singer,

11:14.310 --> 11:15.460

11:15.500 --> 11:17.570

Listen to me.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.910
I know what I'm talking about,ok?

11:18.940 --> 11:21.000
I wasn't a lead singer in a band,ok?

11:21.030 --> 11:22.440
I had a real job.

11:23.460 --> 11:26.160
Colleen,listen to me,hey.

11:27.150 --> 11:29.010
Shit.
Baby's crying.

11:40.070 --> 11:41.840
and then aunt sheila the next?

11:41.870 --> 11:44.380
Ok,it was a lot more complicated than that.

11:44.420 --> 11:46.300
No,it's not.
Ok,tell me.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.760
Explain that part of love to me.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.340
First of all,I was not sleeping with mom one second

11:50.390 --> 11:51.640
and then aunt sheila the next second.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.140
Of course not.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.790
Listen to me,colleen.

11:56.790 --> 11:58.390
I want to make it up to you,you know that.

11:58.420 --> 12:02.380
I'm-I'm clean and I'm sober now.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.460
Hang on,kid.

12:11.610 --> 12:13.350
Hi!

12:13.390 --> 12:14.940
You're here!

12:14.970 --> 12:18.130
- There he goes.
- You're here. Oh.

12:18.150 --> 12:20.220
I missed you so much!

12:20.250 --> 12:22.600
I know.
I know.

12:22.630 --> 12:23.770
All right.

12:25.190 --> 12:27.420
- Ok?
- Oh,oh!

12:27.450 --> 12:29.510
Did you call the window guard guy?

12:29.540 --> 12:31.340
Yeah,I did.
He didn't call me back yet.

12:31.370 --> 12:32.430
Ok. What about the terrace guy?

12:32.480 --> 12:33.860
Is that the same guy as the window guard guy?

12:33.900 --> 12:35.860
- Yes,it's the same guy.
- Ok.

12:35.900 --> 12:36.890
Just,you know-

12:36.920 --> 12:39.060
Eric clapton's kids,I know,I know.

12:39.090 --> 12:42.060
'Cause this is-you know,this is pretty high for a kid.

12:42.510 --> 12:44.120
You know?
It's not-

12:44.150 --> 12:48.740
what are you-get inside!
Jesus christ!

12:50.310 --> 12:51.660
What are you,nuts?

12:51.690 --> 12:53.890
What if you slipped out there,for christ sake?

12:55.630 --> 12:59.730
I'll tell you,that's some show of faith,though,I'll tell you.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.190
What?

13:02.060 --> 13:03.700
What was I just talking about?

13:03.730 --> 13:06.100
- I don't know.
- Eric clapton's kid,huh?

13:06.130 --> 13:08.470
41/2 years old,he's just being a kid,running around the house,

13:08.500 --> 13:10.170
the maid leaves the window open,she's cleaning,

13:10.210 --> 13:12.240
he's being a kid,playing,blah,blah,blah,and bang!

13:12.280 --> 13:13.310
Out the window he goes,huh?

13:13.330 --> 13:14.580
30 something stories to his death.

13:14.610 --> 13:15.930
His father's like 20 blocks away,

13:15.960 --> 13:17.830
he gets the cell phone call,runs for 20 blocks,

13:17.860 --> 13:20.510
picks up the broken little body of his little boy,and what does he do?

13:20.540 --> 13:22.230
He writes that great song,tears in heaven.

13:22.260 --> 13:26.330
You want to talk about faith,that's faith with a capital "F."

13:26.350 --> 13:27.860
Wow.

13:29.100 --> 13:32.000
I will get the goddamn window guards,all right?

13:32.020 --> 13:32.930
You know what?

13:32.960 --> 13:34.800
Ooh,I forgot,I had this great idea.

13:34.830 --> 13:36.870
- There is a jeweler down the block.
- No. No.

13:36.910 --> 13:37.430
- No.
- What,no,wait.

13:37.470 --> 13:39.330
- There's a 2 for one sale.
- No,no,no.

13:39.360 --> 13:39.990
You don't know what I'm gonna say.

13:40.030 --> 13:41.010
I know exactly what you're gonna-

13:41.040 --> 13:43.060
- No,you don'T.
- you know what?

13:43.090 --> 13:44.980
You want to get him an earring,don't you?

13:45.010 --> 13:45.910
Am I wrong?

13:45.940 --> 13:49.220
Let me guess,you want to get him an earring with a little,uh,

13:49.260 --> 13:50.360
T.C.B.In it.

13:50.390 --> 13:52.400
Yeah,taking care of business,huh?

13:52.430 --> 13:55.190
No earrings,no piercings,no tattoos,

13:55.230 --> 13:56.850
no nose rings,nothing for the baby.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.970
Oh,my god,come on,who's gonna notice?
It's this little stud!

14:00.010 --> 14:02.130
What,do you want to blow this thing now?

14:02.160 --> 14:03.370
Janet's like 2 weeks away.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.100
She's got a new boyfriend,she's working for that guy,

14:05.130 --> 14:06.390
he got her a new apartment.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.550
She'll forget about this kid in the next 2 weeks,I guarantee you.

14:08.580 --> 14:09.720
Colleen's already over him.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.350
All right,all right,no piercing.

14:11.380 --> 14:12.930
Nothing!
Ok?

14:12.960 --> 14:14.120
The baby as is.

14:14.150 --> 14:17.480
Don't even draw on him with a crayon,ok?

14:22.890 --> 14:25.330
Valerie.

14:25.360 --> 14:28.050
Is that greek?

14:33.480 --> 14:37.210
So do you like to be called valerie or val?

14:37.240 --> 14:38.890
It's ok.

14:41.170 --> 14:43.340
I- this is weird.

14:44.910 --> 14:48.810
Val makes me think of val kilmer.
Is that weird?

14:50.360 --> 14:52.920
You know,he makes me think of that movie tombstone,he was in.

14:52.960 --> 14:53.990
I don't know if you ever saw it.

14:54.050 --> 14:56.100
Goldie hawn's husband played wyatt earp.

14:56.130 --> 14:58.850
Yeah,but,I mean,

14:58.880 --> 15:02.070
if you really want to talk about wyatt earp,

15:02.100 --> 15:04.210
the only one to really talk about

15:04.250 --> 15:05.880
is kevin costner.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.930
You know,this is like-

15:07.970 --> 15:12.080
my wife named our baby wyatt.

15:12.110 --> 15:13.340
Sexy.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.480
What constitutes a sexy kevin costner movie?

15:16.520 --> 15:19.640
Mmm,silverado.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.910
Where he plays the retard?

15:22.940 --> 15:24.540
He was slow.

15:25.280 --> 15:29.410
'Cause,well,mmm,what about open range?

15:29.440 --> 15:31.700
- I don't know open range.
- No chick knows open range.

15:31.730 --> 15:34.050
This is like one of the greatest kevin costner movies of all time.

15:34.080 --> 15:36.220
Him,robert duvall are protecting annette bening's farm.

15:36.250 --> 15:38.000
It's a little bit too act-ey for me.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.060
- Yeah.
- Too many words.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.740
- I'm bored.
- Yeah?

15:42.770 --> 15:44.500
Take off your pants.

15:49.830 --> 15:52.200
So how's your tourettes thing going,richard?I haven't heard you-

15:52.230 --> 15:53.950
Nigger!

15:53.970 --> 15:55.900
There it is.

15:57.570 --> 15:59.750
Oh,is this the guy?

15:59.770 --> 16:01.110
Son of a bitch.

16:01.130 --> 16:02.530
He's a good-lookin' bastard.

16:02.550 --> 16:04.430
Oh,here she comes.

16:08.180 --> 16:09.580
This is the guy?

16:09.600 --> 16:12.380
Oh,my god.
You gotta be shittin' me. This is a joke.

16:12.390 --> 16:13.890
You're not laughing.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.890
I mean,you kiddin' me,with the trucker hat?

16:15.910 --> 16:18.230
I'm pretty sure that that fad went out already,ok?

16:18.260 --> 16:20.200
Or what,did he drive his 18-wheeler here?

16:20.220 --> 16:22.700
- He's an artist.
- Yeah,he's an idiot.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.260
She says he's emotionally available.

16:26.290 --> 16:28.550
Yeah,well,rich,most homos are.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.920
And he's very passionate.

16:31.310 --> 16:33.010
Passionate?

16:33.030 --> 16:35.140
She said he was passionate?

16:35.770 --> 16:37.640
They go at it.

16:37.660 --> 16:39.610
All the time.

16:40.770 --> 16:43.150
Yeah,like I wasn't passionate!Ok?

16:43.170 --> 16:44.630
I mean,look,I know from passion,all right?

16:44.660 --> 16:46.840
I'm puerto rican,that's what made us famous.

16:46.860 --> 16:48.550
She wants to see passion,how about I walk over there

16:48.590 --> 16:50.400
and pound ashton kutcher's face in?

16:50.430 --> 16:52.120
Well,I wouldn't do that.

16:52.140 --> 16:54.620
She hates when people hit.

16:54.640 --> 16:57.740
That would only push her further away.

16:58.490 --> 17:00.910
Yeah.
You're probably right.

17:01.380 --> 17:03.340
All right,I'll go the other direction.

17:03.770 --> 17:05.690
I'll just-I'll walk over there,

17:05.720 --> 17:07.000
fall on my knees,

17:07.030 --> 17:08.720
tell her i love her more than ever before,

17:08.760 --> 17:10.849
and I'll beg her to marry me again.

17:10.869 --> 17:12.540
Then she'll see that I'm the guy and not this...

17:12.569 --> 17:15.430
this hipster artist shitbag.

17:15.450 --> 17:17.240
And she'll say yes.

17:17.740 --> 17:22.329
Well,maybe she won't say yes,and then at least I'll know for sure that it's over.

17:24.940 --> 17:26.599
All right,give me the ring.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.650
Ok.

17:31.420 --> 17:33.840
You do have the ring,right,rich?

17:33.870 --> 17:36.800
Please tell me you didn't leave it at home.

17:39.620 --> 17:42.380
I'm gettin' married.

17:45.930 --> 17:47.920
Oh,god.

17:47.950 --> 17:50.730
Oh,god,that was amazing.

17:50.760 --> 17:51.880
Yeah.

17:53.120 --> 17:56.370
Felt like it was almost,uh,a minute.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.740
New record.

18:01.580 --> 18:04.230
So,let me guess.

18:05.050 --> 18:06.720
You want a fresca?

18:07.850 --> 18:10.230
That'd be nice.

18:10.650 --> 18:11.940
There's this great place

18:11.990 --> 18:12.910
- down the corner-
- Yeah,I know.

18:12.950 --> 18:15.980
Down to the end of the block,take a right,vinnie's,I got it.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.330
- Hey,listen.
- What?

18:19.390 --> 18:24.390
We just gotta,you know,take it slow.

18:24.420 --> 18:26.110
You know what I mean?Like,

18:26.140 --> 18:29.050
I just gotta get used to you a little bit more.

18:29.070 --> 18:31.070
You know,sexually.

18:31.100 --> 18:33.650
After we've done it about,

18:33.680 --> 18:36.010
I don't know,10,12 times,

18:36.060 --> 18:38.220
you know,after that initial,

18:38.260 --> 18:40.830
you know,I'll get a little bored. So

18:40.860 --> 18:43.870
I'll be able to hold on for a little bit longer,like,

18:43.910 --> 18:46.130
I don't know,6,7 minutes.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.170
I mean,the last guy I went out with,

18:48.210 --> 18:50.640
I mean,oh,my god,by the end of that,

18:50.680 --> 18:52.470
we could go for about 15 minutes.

18:52.510 --> 18:55.420
And,what,it was good?

18:55.450 --> 18:57.710
Oh,well,phhhttt.

18:57.740 --> 18:59.670
Actually,it got a little boring.

18:59.690 --> 19:02.730
I mean,it just took so long.
Plus,the guy was an idiot.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.100
Right.

19:04.130 --> 19:05.630
So...

19:05.660 --> 19:10.930
you're basically saying that this relationship is kind of doomed.

19:11.590 --> 19:14.060
Well,aren't they all?

19:16.530 --> 19:19.530
- Can I have my fresc?
- Yeah,I'm going.

19:19.560 --> 19:20.570
I really like you,though.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.600
Yeah?
I like you,too.

19:22.630 --> 19:24.050
I'll be right back.

19:24.090 --> 19:25.400
Ok.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.990
Oh!
I love your ass.

19:30.030 --> 19:32.310
Yeah.
Me,too.

19:33.310 --> 19:35.360
- Hey.
- Hey,you missed breakfast.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.620
Favorite kevin costner movie of all time,

19:36.650 --> 19:37.750
field of dreams doesn't count,go.

19:37.780 --> 19:38.300
Open range.

19:38.340 --> 19:39.730
Thank you very much.
All I wanted to know.

19:39.770 --> 19:41.520
Boy,someone's awful charged up this morning.

19:41.550 --> 19:44.410
I got 8 frescas in me,lou,I'm on a massive nutrasweet high.

19:44.430 --> 19:45.180
Don't get me started.

19:45.210 --> 19:48.010
Oh,speaking of high,your new girlfriend came here looking for you.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.010
Feinberg's daughter.

19:49.040 --> 19:50.210
I don't know what she's on,

19:50.240 --> 19:53.300
but I think her purse may contain the contents of what used to be in

19:53.360 --> 19:54.960
liza minelli's medicine cabinet.

19:54.990 --> 19:56.090
Isn't that enough to kill a man?

19:56.120 --> 19:57.820
Didn't make a dent in david gest.

19:59.640 --> 20:00.860
Tom.

20:01.330 --> 20:02.260
- Tom.
- Lou?

20:02.290 --> 20:04.080
- Tom. Tommy.
- Lou!

20:04.130 --> 20:05.420
Thomas gavin.

20:05.450 --> 20:06.310
I'm not doin' it.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.260
I'm not taking her out again.

20:07.290 --> 20:09.340
You see these?
You see these?

20:09.360 --> 20:11.340
Look,this is not a request,this is an order,ok?

20:11.370 --> 20:12.840
It's the right thing to do for the crew,

20:12.890 --> 20:13.880
it's the right thing to do for you,

20:13.920 --> 20:16.130
and it's the right thing to do for your relationship with feinberg.

20:16.170 --> 20:18.480
I mean,it's a genius political move.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.920
You take her out,you give her a little kiss,give her a little feel,

20:20.950 --> 20:22.870
make her think that you're interested.

20:22.900 --> 20:24.160
What if she gets interested?

20:24.190 --> 20:25.220
Well,then you give her the whole,you know,

20:25.250 --> 20:27.350
"look,I'm a mess,and you're so great,

20:27.380 --> 20:28.750
and I can't give you what you need,

20:28.780 --> 20:32.730
so I'm gonna have to do the horrible thing and walk away

20:32.760 --> 20:34.410
and think about you for the rest of my life,

20:34.450 --> 20:35.650
especially when I'm masturbating. "

20:35.690 --> 20:37.550
Famous lou end of the relationship line.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.150
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:38.190 --> 20:39.180
Hey,guys.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.540
Whoo.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.020
I'm dyin'.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.180
I can barely keep my eyes open.

20:43.210 --> 20:44.690
I got hammered last night.

20:44.720 --> 20:47.830
Those long island ice teas really do a number on you,you know?

20:47.860 --> 20:49.760
- Brutal.
- Yeah.

20:51.530 --> 20:53.390
Hey,you want to know how many I had?

20:53.420 --> 20:56.220
2.
And a half.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.100
It was,you know,hardcore.

20:58.130 --> 20:59.610
You know where I woke up this morning?

20:59.640 --> 21:01.210
My couch.

21:01.240 --> 21:03.750
It's pretty goddamn embarassing,you know?

21:06.460 --> 21:08.890
I think I might have a problem.

21:14.270 --> 21:15.800
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:16.620 --> 21:20.550
I have been waiting for this moment for a long,long time.

21:20.590 --> 21:21.350
What's that?

21:21.380 --> 21:23.330
A little thing we like to call the 20 questions.

21:23.360 --> 21:24.370
It's from alcoholics anonymous.

21:24.390 --> 21:27.670
It's kind of a little booze exam,if you'd like to take it.

21:27.700 --> 21:28.420
Ok.

21:28.440 --> 21:30.410
"Is drinking making your home life unhappy?"

21:30.440 --> 21:33.600
It's mostly her drinking,so,no.

21:33.630 --> 21:35.820
"Do you drink because you're shy with other people?" No.

21:35.860 --> 21:37.870
"Is drinking affecting your reputation?" No.

21:37.900 --> 21:39.730
No.
No.

21:39.770 --> 21:41.860
Are you supposed to haveyesesyesses for this?

21:41.890 --> 21:44.430
Because if it's nos,I'm gonna ace this thing.

21:44.450 --> 21:45.550
Lou?

21:45.580 --> 21:47.340
One night in the not too distant future,

21:47.380 --> 21:49.930
my cousin mike and I are going to take you out drinking.

21:49.970 --> 21:55.060
And if we notice that you like to drink and get drunk and drink to excess,

21:55.080 --> 21:58.030
and if you pass the shay cousin's drinking exam,

21:58.060 --> 22:00.360
then you will be called an alcoholic.

22:00.390 --> 22:01.690
Why is that?

22:01.710 --> 22:03.160
Because we're all alcoholics.

22:03.190 --> 22:06.680
Functioning,yes,but blazing alkies all the same.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.880
Wow. Ok.
You're on.

22:08.910 --> 22:13.380
So excess is like how many long island ice teas exactly?

22:17.360 --> 22:19.570
Ha ha,nice.

22:19.610 --> 22:20.800
This is good,man.

22:20.830 --> 22:24.610
I remember this. This is neely fights brashear in brashear's rookie season.

22:24.640 --> 22:25.910
They had like 3 or 4 great battles.

22:25.940 --> 22:28.420
This is where this hockey shit confuses me.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.930
Ok,you're not allowed to fight,but then you can fight.

22:31.950 --> 22:35.480
And after you're tired and all warn out from the fight you're not allowed to have,

22:35.530 --> 22:37.850
they give you a 5-minute vitamin water break.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.630
It just makes no sense. Right?

22:40.440 --> 22:42.570
Yeah,well,hey,man.
That shit would be fun around here.

22:42.610 --> 22:43.550
Beat the shit out of some guy,

22:43.580 --> 22:45.980
go spend 5 minutes in the rig drinking vitamin water?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.970
You know,it's not such a crazy idea.

22:47.990 --> 22:49.340
You know,you think about it,

22:49.370 --> 22:50.630
you take a swing at somebody around here,

22:50.670 --> 22:52.580
get it out of your system,you go sit in the rig.

22:52.620 --> 22:53.940
Take a little break,time out,

22:53.980 --> 22:55.730
5 minutes later you come back,clean slate.

22:55.760 --> 22:56.750
I mean,seriously,frankie,

22:56.790 --> 22:59.910
if you could take a swing at somebody in the house,who would it be?

22:59.930 --> 23:01.330
Oh,if it had to be somebody in this house,

23:01.350 --> 23:05.390
I guess I'd invite that piece of shit over who's bangin' my possibly former fiance,

23:05.420 --> 23:07.790
and I'd pound him in the goddamn face,repeatedly.

23:07.830 --> 23:10.000
Sounds like fun,but it has to be somebody actually on the crew.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.710
Come on.
Who would you pick?

23:11.730 --> 23:13.090
Silletti.

23:15.210 --> 23:16.940
Garrity,who would you take a swing at?

23:16.960 --> 23:19.120
- Ok,no retribution?
- None.

23:19.150 --> 23:22.250
No lingering animosity or future sucker punches?

23:22.290 --> 23:23.130
- Nothing.
- In any way?

23:23.150 --> 23:25.360
- Nope.
- Ok,you.

23:27.430 --> 23:28.540
Why would you take a swing at me?

23:28.570 --> 23:29.720
You said you wanted a name.

23:29.740 --> 23:31.660
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:31.670 --> 23:32.750
How about you,tom,who would you hit?

23:32.770 --> 23:33.970
Well,I was gonna hit black shawn,

23:34.000 --> 23:35.630
but,you know,now I'm gonna hit garrity.

23:35.660 --> 23:36.940
Um,you just said there was no retribution.

23:36.960 --> 23:38.730
Well,it's not retribution,that's self defense.

23:38.760 --> 23:40.290
- You hit me first.
- I didn't hit you!

23:40.320 --> 23:43.050
Hey,why would you want to hit me?

23:43.070 --> 23:45.600
Why would-ok,let's just not waste anybody's time.

23:45.630 --> 23:47.960
I'll make a list of why I wouldn't want to hit you,ok?

23:47.990 --> 23:50.340
See,that's the problem with you hockey players.

23:50.370 --> 23:51.480
You're all animals.

23:51.510 --> 23:53.040
All you want to do is fight.

23:53.070 --> 23:56.620
You got all this hostility and anger and madness

23:56.660 --> 23:58.160
all pent up inside you.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.720
Ok,you're such a hotshot,

23:59.760 --> 24:02.240
why don't you put your balls where your mouth is?

24:02.300 --> 24:03.430
That came out wrong.

24:03.460 --> 24:05.400
What I'm trying to say is,you always complain about hockey,

24:05.440 --> 24:07.070
why don't you- you ever played hockey?

24:07.090 --> 24:08.420
That doesn't matter,I got balls,though.

24:08.440 --> 24:09.720
- You got balls?
- Yeah,I got balls!

24:09.750 --> 24:10.510
- You got balls?
- Yeah!

24:10.550 --> 24:11.790
Yeah,let's see.
Come down and play with us.

24:11.820 --> 24:13.120
Play some street hockey with us,ok?

24:13.170 --> 24:15.140
We're playing tomorrow morning.
Captain hoops,huh?

24:15.170 --> 24:16.870
Well,I don't skate,so...

24:16.900 --> 24:18.780
There's no skating,we do it on foot,just like basketball,

24:18.810 --> 24:21.210
except we don't wear those little pussy underwear uniforms,ok?

24:21.250 --> 24:21.970
We play like we're men.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.510
All right,all right,enough said,enough said,I'm down. I'm in.

24:25.540 --> 24:29.090
Bring your big black balls to street hockey tomorrow morning at 9:00,ok?

24:29.110 --> 24:30.240
- All right?
- I'll do that.

24:30.280 --> 24:33.560
I'm in. I played a little-a little floor hockey in grammar school.

24:33.590 --> 24:35.940
- Oh,yeah,it's just like floor hockey.
- Yeah,I'll be there.

24:35.970 --> 24:37.520
Ok,bring your floor hockey balls tomorrow.

24:37.550 --> 24:39.490
You just make sure your pink balls are down there.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.370
My pink balls-hey,my balls are not pink,asshole,ok?

24:42.400 --> 24:44.570
All right?
My balls are tan!

24:44.600 --> 24:46.480
Tan balls!

24:47.580 --> 24:50.270
Jerk.
What?

24:50.290 --> 24:51.330
You got tan balls?

24:51.360 --> 24:53.440
Yeah,I got tan-what color are your balls?

24:53.460 --> 24:56.780
Since I married your sister?
Pretty much blue.

24:58.790 --> 25:01.900
All right,guys. Take some of these,pass them around.

25:01.940 --> 25:04.520
Make sure everybody's got paper and some pencils.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.530
You're gonna do this with a real sponsor someday.

25:07.550 --> 25:09.460
God help whoever that is.

25:09.940 --> 25:12.290
We're gonna talk about making amends.

25:12.310 --> 25:15.100
Is this homework?
Oh,that's perfect.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.710
Try and stay positive,maggs,will you?

25:16.730 --> 25:18.230
Super.

25:18.800 --> 25:21.460
What I want you all to do,all right,

25:21.490 --> 25:26.250
is I want you to make a list of people you've harmed with your drinking,all right?

25:26.280 --> 25:28.820
People you verbally or physically abused,

25:28.860 --> 25:31.030
people you forced away because of your disease.

25:31.050 --> 25:34.530
You take a few minutes,think about it,and start your list,all right?

25:37.580 --> 25:39.300
What?

25:39.330 --> 25:41.430
Oh,shit,this is hard.

25:44.990 --> 25:47.170
You're shittin' me,right?

25:48.180 --> 25:49.450
What?

25:49.480 --> 25:51.485
My name's not your top 3?

25:51.520 --> 25:53.640
Guys,guys,just keep writing,will you?

25:53.670 --> 25:55.230
Excuse me.

25:55.260 --> 25:59.570
How have I hurt you with my drinking?
Give me one for instance.

25:59.590 --> 26:01.540
Bottle of midori.

26:02.350 --> 26:04.330
I had to leave the firehouse,

26:04.360 --> 26:07.100
come and get you outside of club downtown.

26:07.550 --> 26:11.160
You puked all over the inside of my cordova.

26:11.180 --> 26:14.420
You know what,I was 14 years old,and that was the first time I ever drank.

26:14.440 --> 26:17.340
All the more reason why I should be number one.

26:19.590 --> 26:21.320
Am I on your list?

26:21.340 --> 26:23.060
For what?

26:24.130 --> 26:25.880
Christmas.

26:25.910 --> 26:27.640
'86.

26:28.040 --> 26:30.800
You grabbed my left tit,teddy.

26:32.440 --> 26:36.100
First of all,it was a slight graze.

26:36.130 --> 26:41.360
Second of all,I drank half a bowl of eggnog that night,through a straw!

26:41.380 --> 26:46.540
And third of all,most important,I would never,ever,ever do such a thing.

26:47.070 --> 26:49.760
Guys,please.
Stick to it,will ya?

26:49.780 --> 26:52.660
I was wondering if we could go back to talking about the higher power thing

26:52.700 --> 26:54.980
that we were talking about in last week's meeting,you know?

26:55.020 --> 26:56.390
Jesus christ.

26:56.420 --> 26:59.810
- You got a problem with-
- What,the goddamn god stuff again?

26:59.830 --> 27:01.930
Yeah,the god stuff again.
Yeah.

27:01.970 --> 27:04.340
We got like 9 more steps to go here.

27:04.380 --> 27:06.370
This is turning into goddamn summer school!

27:06.400 --> 27:08.810
- You know-
- No,tom,tom,say what you gotta say.

27:08.850 --> 27:10.590
- I want to hear it.
- Thank you,maggs.

27:10.620 --> 27:12.650
Ok,thank you for at least one person here-

27:12.700 --> 27:14.140
- I do.
- Yes.

27:14.170 --> 27:16.360
- Being polite-
- And caring.

27:16.390 --> 27:18.400
Yes,and caring.
Thank you.

27:18.440 --> 27:20.320
Go ahead.

27:21.490 --> 27:24.320
- God...
- God. Thank you.

27:25.080 --> 27:28.820
I prayed this week,you know.

27:28.850 --> 27:32.190
I said a prayer,and I think it actually made a difference.

27:32.230 --> 27:34.000
I think it helped me.

27:34.030 --> 27:36.420
It saved this guy who was hanging off the side of a building.

27:36.450 --> 27:38.170
I read all about it in the papers.

27:38.190 --> 27:39.400
- Yeah.
- The window washer,right?

27:39.430 --> 27:40.080
Yes.

27:40.110 --> 27:42.790
You used the diamond-studded saw to cut a hole through the window.

27:42.830 --> 27:45.710
- Yes.
- Did god invent this saw?No.

27:45.750 --> 27:46.310
That's not-

27:46.340 --> 27:50.160
This wasn't god,this was technology,and balls.

27:50.190 --> 27:53.200
Don't sell yourself short,tom.

27:53.850 --> 27:56.020
I prayed this week.

27:57.620 --> 27:59.050
Yeah.

28:00.030 --> 28:02.430
I prayed this guy that I was defending,

28:02.470 --> 28:05.250
this douchebag I was defending,

28:05.280 --> 28:06.900
who I know for a fact killed his wife,

28:06.930 --> 28:09.430
I prayed that the son of a bitch wouldn't get off.

28:09.450 --> 28:11.440
I prayed that I would lose,you know.

28:11.470 --> 28:13.060
You know what happened?

28:13.100 --> 28:14.940
I won.

28:15.580 --> 28:18.300
I won. The piece of shit is out there walkin' the streets.

28:18.320 --> 28:20.400
So shitload of good that praying to god did for me.

28:20.420 --> 28:22.850
So I ask you,who should I be praying to,huh?Satan?

28:22.890 --> 28:26.050
Oh,every time I hear satan's name,I think of david lee roth.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.820
Oh,get out of here!
He's number four on my list!

28:28.840 --> 28:29.720
See!
Look!

28:29.760 --> 28:31.470
Oh,my god.

28:31.490 --> 28:33.770
Judge reinhold?

28:34.710 --> 28:36.120
Hey.

28:36.140 --> 28:37.670
How you doin'?

28:37.700 --> 28:39.600
Well,how do you think I'm doin'?

28:39.630 --> 28:41.710
I'm drinkin' club soda.

28:41.730 --> 28:43.110
Just askin'.

28:43.130 --> 28:44.440
How'd the meeting go?

28:44.460 --> 28:46.140
It was all right,you know?

28:46.160 --> 28:47.590
We talked about amends.

28:48.720 --> 28:52.510
Apologizing to people that you did or said shitty things to.

28:52.530 --> 28:55.490
You know,making,what do they call it,reparations,you know?

28:55.520 --> 28:59.740
I apologize to the 5 nazi pricks I killed in the war.

28:59.770 --> 29:01.750
5?I thought it was a lot more than that.

29:01.780 --> 29:04.690
I'm talkin' about the ones I killed hand to hand.

29:04.710 --> 29:07.560
- There's more of a connection.
- Right.

29:07.580 --> 29:10.640
I apologize to patton for calling him an asshole.

29:10.680 --> 29:12.040
You said he was an asshole.

29:12.060 --> 29:15.390
He was. You're right.
I take that one back.

29:15.420 --> 29:20.830
I'm sorry about your sister,my darling rosemary,

29:20.860 --> 29:22.730
for sending her off to that school.

29:23.330 --> 29:27.360
And I'm sorry,maybe,about you a little.

29:27.390 --> 29:29.010
Dad,listen to me.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.610
You have nothing to apologize to me about,ok?

29:31.640 --> 29:32.890
No,I do.

29:32.910 --> 29:34.440
Some of the shit I did.

29:34.470 --> 29:36.200
I was never home.

29:36.230 --> 29:38.540
I was always off fightin' goddamn fires.

29:38.570 --> 29:39.710
I get it.

29:39.730 --> 29:43.800
When I was home,I did a lot of things faster then I should have.

29:43.830 --> 29:46.570
I tossed you in the pool down at the boy's club,

29:46.600 --> 29:48.630
see if you'd sink or swim.

29:48.660 --> 29:50.760
You swam,by the way.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.860
I wanted to toughen you out.

29:52.890 --> 29:55.530
You were so goddamn timid.

29:55.560 --> 29:58.750
You were never
Afraid of anything?

29:58.770 --> 30:00.040
Shit,yeah.

30:00.070 --> 30:02.520
In the war,the whole goddamn time.

30:02.550 --> 30:05.270
After the war,not so much.

30:05.290 --> 30:09.530
There's nothin' on this planet that scares you?

30:09.560 --> 30:10.990
Not a thing?

30:11.010 --> 30:13.540
Yeah.
There is one thing.

30:13.560 --> 30:15.700
What?

30:15.730 --> 30:18.810
Some people think that when you die,

30:18.850 --> 30:23.600
you see people,like your wife,and,uh,

30:23.640 --> 30:25.890
elvis and jack kennedy.

30:25.920 --> 30:28.730
And you and me both know that's bullshit.

30:28.750 --> 30:34.690
I'm not seeing your mother or johnny or connor ever again

30:34.720 --> 30:36.100
I know that.

30:36.120 --> 30:40.050
You die,they stick your body in the ground,

30:40.090 --> 30:42.110
and you're worm food.

30:42.130 --> 30:43.760
Simple as that.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.800
Death is a goddamn scary thing,tom.

30:46.830 --> 30:49.960
The closer you get to it,the scarier it gets.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.400
Screw it.

30:51.430 --> 30:53.480
I'm gonna order a drink.

30:53.500 --> 30:55.580
I'm kidding.

31:01.820 --> 31:03.740
One,two,go.

31:04.260 --> 31:06.740
All right,guys,let's go.
Everybody up.

31:18.100 --> 31:20.530
Hey,shawn,play the man,not the ball.

31:40.450 --> 31:42.200
Come on.

31:44.360 --> 31:47.060
Shawn,play the man,not the ball.
Take the body.

31:47.090 --> 31:49.070
What are you tellin' him what to do for,all right?

31:49.090 --> 31:50.940
This is only about us.

31:51.880 --> 31:53.150
Yeah!

31:56.660 --> 31:58.380
That damn tommy,man.

31:58.970 --> 32:01.970
- Yeah,he's good.
- Yeah. Real good.

32:03.690 --> 32:06.900
Feels like he's treating me like his bitch out there,you know?

32:08.780 --> 32:11.990
It'd be nice to treat him like my bitch out there.

32:15.060 --> 32:17.790
You know,all good players have a weakness.

32:17.830 --> 32:23.460
I just have to find out what tommy's weaknesses are.

32:23.980 --> 32:25.800
Give me one of those,will you?

32:26.300 --> 32:31.210
Look at black shawn talkin' to mike.

32:31.650 --> 32:35.290
Me and you,we're a lot alike,you know?

32:35.320 --> 32:36.700
Probies.

32:36.720 --> 32:39.060
Uh,I'm-I'm not a probie.

32:39.090 --> 32:41.030
You know what I mean.

32:41.510 --> 32:44.360
They always want to give us shit,you know?

32:44.380 --> 32:46.280
You're saying we're,like,bros?

32:46.310 --> 32:48.470
We're like brothers.

32:48.490 --> 32:50.580
That's cool,man.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.020
You know...

32:53.730 --> 32:56.000
I know what up,you know?

32:58.580 --> 33:01.520
When I first started playing with tommy,he used to make me feel like that,man.

33:01.550 --> 33:04.070
- He makes you feel like shit.
- Exactly,man.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.730
But I learned his,like,weak points,you know,

33:06.750 --> 33:09.390
and you can use that to,like,even things out,you know?

33:09.420 --> 33:11.150
Yeah.

33:12.110 --> 33:13.980
He's old,man.
You know,you're fast.

33:14.020 --> 33:16.600
Tire him out,and then do your thing,you know?

33:16.620 --> 33:19.160
He's gonna tire quicker then you,you know?

34:06.440 --> 34:08.739
- Nice!
- Come on!

34:13.820 --> 34:16.199
Yeah!

34:17.350 --> 34:20.350
Hey,tommy,a little advice,next time play on the black kid's team.

34:20.370 --> 34:22.340
Yeah,funny.
Real funny.

34:22.380 --> 34:24.310
What'd you say to black shawn before?

34:24.330 --> 34:25.940
I didn't say anything.

34:25.969 --> 34:27.260
Really?

34:27.280 --> 34:29.080
'Cause I saw you whispering to him.

34:29.960 --> 34:31.320
What were you sayin'?

34:31.350 --> 34:33.400
He was just asking for some pointers.

34:33.429 --> 34:35.350
I- I saw sean-

34:35.380 --> 34:37.250
sean gave him pointers before,so I just-

34:37.290 --> 34:38.980
Oh,really?Yeah?

34:39.010 --> 34:42.250
You know I wouldn't say anything bad,tommy.

34:43.810 --> 34:44.810
He was talkin' shit.

34:44.840 --> 34:47.880
You know the saying,keep your enemies close...

34:48.730 --> 34:50.270
and...

34:50.300 --> 34:52.570
keep your enemies close.

34:52.590 --> 34:55.370
I jumped off a roof for you,asshole.

35:07.290 --> 35:09.110
That's um...

35:09.140 --> 35:11.970
I didn't know you drank bourbon.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.840
Last time you were drinking- sorry,want a nut?

35:16.500 --> 35:21.170
Um,I think they called it the miami vice,right?

35:22.680 --> 35:25.560
Instead I had bourbon.

35:27.070 --> 35:29.200
I don't know.

35:30.490 --> 35:33.920
How's it going with the,uh,with the ghetto,uh,

35:33.960 --> 35:35.270
kids?How's that going?

35:35.300 --> 35:36.990
What do you mean?

35:38.130 --> 35:40.940
You said that you were working with the kids-

35:40.990 --> 35:42.670
I don't have a job. I don't work.

35:42.700 --> 35:44.740
I can't work.

35:45.770 --> 35:49.750
I can't-I can't-I can't have a job.

35:50.310 --> 35:52.990
So there are no ghetto kids.

35:56.740 --> 35:58.800
- You ok?
- I'm fine.

35:58.830 --> 35:59.850
I'm fine.

35:59.880 --> 36:02.060
On the first date,you were a little-

36:02.100 --> 36:03.670
you know,just a little more up.

36:03.700 --> 36:05.020
And,uh,you were funny.

36:05.050 --> 36:06.410
You were really making me laugh.

36:06.440 --> 36:08.030
- Funny?
- You were really funny.

36:08.060 --> 36:10.290
What,like joe pesci funny?

36:10.320 --> 36:11.730
Like buddy hackett funny?

36:11.750 --> 36:13.600
- No,no,no.
- What do you mean,funny?

36:13.630 --> 36:15.400
What,do I look funny to you?

36:15.430 --> 36:16.030
No!

36:16.060 --> 36:17.670
Oh,should we all be laughing right now?

36:17.710 --> 36:21.480
I'm funny.
I don't- I don't-whatever.

36:21.510 --> 36:24.320
I thought-I was...

36:29.880 --> 36:32.670
well,ahem,sometimes,you know...

36:33.430 --> 36:37.140
you know,I don't drink,so when I come to a place like this-ahem-

36:37.180 --> 36:41.540
I look at,like,the vodka bottles-

36:41.570 --> 36:43.120
I used to drink vodka,so it's always-

36:43.160 --> 36:45.840
that's what I look at,but all the crazy bottles they have now,

36:45.880 --> 36:49.470
like some of these-like,designer-

36:49.500 --> 36:51.570
like that trump vodka.

36:51.600 --> 36:56.100
That's like gold plated,that bottle that's up there.

36:56.130 --> 36:57.970
Oh,yeah.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.010
So...

37:00.040 --> 37:02.050
of course,it always makes me think-

37:02.080 --> 37:05.140
You know,I'm on medication right now.

37:05.160 --> 37:07.940
I'm,um,I'm what you call bi-polar.

37:07.970 --> 37:12.850
And sometimes I have to take mood stabilizers or brain-drainers for it.

37:12.880 --> 37:15.700
I mean I go off it sometimes,but my parents

37:15.730 --> 37:17.820
always want me to go back on it,'cause they just,

37:17.860 --> 37:19.530
you know,are afraid that if I go off it,

37:19.570 --> 37:22.380
then I'm just gonna snap and try to,you know,

37:22.410 --> 37:24.170
run into the room where they're sleeping

37:24.210 --> 37:27.590
and stab their eyeballs out with an ice pick or rip their chest out

37:27.620 --> 37:32.280
and then bury it in the backyard next to my ovaries,you know?

37:33.180 --> 37:35.000
- Why'd you take your hand away?
- What?

37:35.030 --> 37:37.040
Why is your hand under my underpants?

37:37.070 --> 37:39.160
No,no,I'm outside the dress.

37:39.200 --> 37:41.620
I was just...

37:42.490 --> 37:44.500
was it the ice pick thing?

37:44.550 --> 37:47.400
No.

37:47.430 --> 37:49.720
stop lying to me. why would you- did you take your hand away?

37:49.860 --> 37:52.120
- was it the ice pick thing?
- No. I just xxxx

37:52.160 --> 37:53.660
I can stab you with the fork.

37:53.700 --> 37:56.470
I could do that. I'm capable- I'm just saying I'm capable of doing this thing.

37:56.510 --> 37:57.460
- okay.
- it's crazy.

37:57.490 --> 37:58.670
I'm just... trying to...

37:58.700 --> 38:02.280
don't try, just be... you're making me nervous, you-

38:02.310 --> 38:03.730
I was all over the place.

38:03.750 --> 38:05.280
I'm... sorry.

38:05.320 --> 38:07.400
it't not- it's not me, it's you.

38:07.430 --> 38:08.990
I'm sorry, I just... I should go.

38:09.030 --> 38:10.550
this wasn't a good idea.

38:10.580 --> 38:11.760
No no no no, you don't have to go.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.450
no, I still have a surgery tomorrow, I should go.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.080
- you have surgery?
- yeah, bye.

38:15.110 --> 38:16.620
- thank you, really.

38:16.660 --> 38:18.420
