00:02.501 --> 00:06.198
I didn't think Lana would find someone
to cover her shift this late in the game.

00:06.372 --> 00:08.636
Guess I should have figured
on the Clark factor.

00:08.808 --> 00:12.175
It sounded like she was having her
own crisis over Jensen's history exam.

00:12.345 --> 00:15.746
Thanks for coming. I know this can't
compete with the all-you-can-drink...

00:15.915 --> 00:18.281
-...Talon cram session.
-Definitely not.

00:22.388 --> 00:25.186
I think it's great you spend so much time
volunteering here.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.826
Someone's always been there
when I've been in trouble.

00:27.994 --> 00:30.053
Seems like a good way
to give something back.

00:30.229 --> 00:31.856
Hi, Pete.

00:35.568 --> 00:37.433
And to hone your sensitive-guy skills.

00:39.505 --> 00:41.439
Watch and learn.

00:43.009 --> 00:44.499
Teen Crisis Hotline.

00:49.415 --> 00:52.111
Well, how long has it been
since they've been divorced?

00:52.285 --> 00:55.049
Yeah, I know. That can be tough.

00:56.022 --> 00:58.286
Well, have you talked to them about it?

01:01.861 --> 01:03.590
Yeah.

01:08.167 --> 01:10.727
Teen Crisis Hotline.

01:11.203 --> 01:13.137
-Clark!
-Lana.

01:13.439 --> 01:14.997
Clark, it's happening!

01:15.808 --> 01:17.605
-Are you there?
-Lana?

01:17.777 --> 01:19.768
-He's got a gun!
-And the shot is up....

01:20.279 --> 01:24.010
And good. 61 to 60, Vipers.

01:26.152 --> 01:29.986
Clark! Please, help me!

01:30.156 --> 01:32.454
Lana? Lana, what?

01:36.128 --> 01:38.722
Lana? Lana?

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:47.707 --> 01:52.167
Lana! Lana, can you hear me? Lana!

01:52.611 --> 01:53.976
Pete, call the police.

01:54.146 --> 01:56.910
Hey-- Please hold. Hold.

02:18.237 --> 02:20.728
Hey, Clark. Knock much?

02:20.906 --> 02:24.774
You're too late. I turned off
the cappuccino machine an hour ago.

03:28.274 --> 03:30.435
Please, help me!

03:30.609 --> 03:33.669
Lana? Lana!

03:37.450 --> 03:38.974
The call came from a blocked lD.

03:39.652 --> 03:43.486
-Sounds like your voice, Ms. Lang.
-I know, but it can't be.

03:43.656 --> 03:46.420
We think it's some sort
of a prank, sheriff.

03:46.992 --> 03:52.055
You know, usually these situations originate
a little closer to home than you'd expect.

03:52.398 --> 03:55.458
Any reason you might wanna
goose these boys with a crank call?

03:55.835 --> 03:59.202
-Lana didn't have anything to do with this.
-Unless Ms. Lang has grown...

03:59.371 --> 04:02.363
...several inches and developed
an affinity for plaid...

04:02.541 --> 04:05.408
...this would be a good time
for you to pipe down.

04:05.578 --> 04:08.103
I suppose someone
could be imitating you.

04:08.481 --> 04:10.005
Why would anyone do that?

04:10.950 --> 04:13.714
If I had the answer to half the "whys"
in this town...

04:13.886 --> 04:15.683
...I'd have a bestseller on my hands.

04:16.188 --> 04:17.916
I'll look into this.

04:18.089 --> 04:22.754
But you kids need to know that crank calls
aren't exactly a top priority.

04:27.466 --> 04:28.797
You okay?

04:29.668 --> 04:31.795
You know, if someone is doing this
as a joke...

04:31.971 --> 04:34.599
...they have a pretty sick
sense of humor.

04:34.773 --> 04:38.231
Don't worry. We'll figure out who did this.

04:46.151 --> 04:50.110
This connection's bad.
We're missing pieces of the conversation.

04:50.289 --> 04:54.123
But the background noise
is constant throughout.

04:54.293 --> 04:56.523
This recording wasn't
piecemealed together.

04:56.695 --> 04:59.858
Here, I'll play it again with the static
as low as I can get it.

05:04.136 --> 05:05.398
That sounds like rain.

05:06.205 --> 05:08.673
We haven't had a storm in months.

05:10.109 --> 05:11.542
Clark, it's happening!

05:12.778 --> 05:14.507
Why would I say that?

05:14.680 --> 05:17.274
It's almost like
you were expecting something.

05:18.751 --> 05:22.551
Clark! Please, help me!

05:25.925 --> 05:27.916
You lied to me!

05:28.294 --> 05:30.159
Hey, Chloe, can l?

05:31.297 --> 05:32.889
Yeah.

05:35.367 --> 05:36.891
I think I heard something.

05:46.679 --> 05:49.409
You lied to me!

05:50.082 --> 05:51.447
That's Adam.

05:51.617 --> 05:54.484
But I haven't spoken to him since he left.

05:55.187 --> 05:56.779
Clark, how did you hear that?

05:58.657 --> 06:02.058
Guess I missed too many Linkin Park
concerts. Look, there's someone else here.

06:02.995 --> 06:04.986
He shoots....

06:07.132 --> 06:10.260
And good. That makes the score
61 to 60, Vipers.

06:10.436 --> 06:13.564
Gunnerson needs to miss the second shot
to keep the Vipers ' hopes...

06:13.739 --> 06:15.866
-...for an undefeated season alive.
-Gunnerson?

06:16.041 --> 06:17.668
He was benched in the preseason.

06:17.843 --> 06:20.744
-This has to be a recording of an old game.
-No, that can't be.

06:20.913 --> 06:24.041
This is the first year the Vipers
have been undefeated.

06:30.422 --> 06:33.755
They're not even scheduled to play
the Metros until tonight.

06:35.461 --> 06:38.794
And according to the weather service,
a storm's on the way.

06:39.231 --> 06:43.861
Well, if none of this has happened yet,
maybe the phone call hadn't either.

06:46.605 --> 06:49.472
You're saying the call came
from the future?

07:01.654 --> 07:03.144
What is this?

07:03.322 --> 07:05.916
An experimental medication.

07:06.091 --> 07:09.788
Not exactly FDA approved, but I assume
you're working on the patent.

07:09.962 --> 07:12.590
Oh, Lex, I don't have time for 20 questions.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.790
I know about the lab at Metron.

07:16.702 --> 07:19.000
Gives new meaning to the term
"human resources."

07:19.505 --> 07:22.872
You know, there are hundreds of
projects in development at LuthorCorp.

07:23.042 --> 07:27.877
You'll have to forgive me if I'm not current
on all the details about.... What, Metron?

07:29.181 --> 07:32.309
You're secretly developing a serum...

07:32.484 --> 07:36.648
...that has a certain Lazarus effect
on the dearly departed.

07:38.924 --> 07:40.653
Resuscitating the dead?

07:43.796 --> 07:49.257
I think your creative talents
are being wasted at LuthorCorp, son.

07:49.435 --> 07:52.734
Unfortunately, this isn't fiction.

07:54.006 --> 07:57.567
So far, the Kafkaesque trials have caused
patients' bodies...

07:57.743 --> 08:01.736
...to deteriorate while their minds
retain consciousness.

08:01.947 --> 08:03.915
Sort of bypasses the code of ethics...

08:04.083 --> 08:08.076
...but I suppose if you were successful,
it could mean big business.

08:08.353 --> 08:11.914
I applaud your moral outrage...

08:12.091 --> 08:17.893
...but these papers don't specifically
confirm any of your accusations, son.

08:18.230 --> 08:22.132
Although they would raise a few eyebrows
at the Daily Planet.

08:24.069 --> 08:26.765
You know, you don't have to resort
to threats, Lex...

08:26.939 --> 08:28.907
...if you wanna shut this project down.

08:31.343 --> 08:33.777
I must not be making myself clear.

08:34.847 --> 08:38.339
I came back to LuthorCorp to be
your partner, not a paper pusher.

08:38.517 --> 08:42.009
This new project can make the company
billions of dollars.

08:42.187 --> 08:44.781
I don't want it shut down.

08:46.425 --> 08:49.360
I wanna be put in charge of it.

09:05.110 --> 09:08.568
What are you doing?
This is a restricted area.

09:08.747 --> 09:11.011
Apparently not.

09:15.220 --> 09:18.712
You failed to mention, Dr. Teng,
that my son...

09:19.858 --> 09:22.156
...recently paid you a visit.

09:23.328 --> 09:27.094
I don't know how he found us,
but I didn't tell him anything.

09:27.266 --> 09:32.203
That's irrelevant now because, as of
this moment, this project never existed.

09:32.371 --> 09:34.464
We haven't tested
the most recent adjustments.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.268
Don't worry, Dr. Teng,
your work will continue.

09:37.442 --> 09:38.841
Just not here.

09:40.279 --> 09:45.581
I want this lab cleared out
by the end of the day.

09:45.784 --> 09:50.915
Or this time you will find yourself deported
back to your native homeland.

09:51.089 --> 09:57.392
If I'm not mistaken, your government does
not have much use for women who have...

09:57.563 --> 10:01.795
...consorted with the devils
of Western capitalism.

10:03.569 --> 10:05.127
Come on.

10:05.804 --> 10:07.362
Am I right?

11:01.693 --> 11:03.524
Where have you been?

11:04.429 --> 11:08.729
I'm sorry, Adam.
I know you're in a lot of pain.

11:10.302 --> 11:11.894
Then why did you do this to me?

11:12.404 --> 11:14.565
We were trying to give you
a second chance.

11:15.474 --> 11:18.705
I've been hearing a lot of noise out there.
What's going on?

11:19.411 --> 11:21.003
They're shutting down the lab.

11:21.914 --> 11:24.007
Where are we going?

11:28.553 --> 11:30.077
You're not taking me with you.

11:30.722 --> 11:32.212
I can't.

11:32.691 --> 11:34.716
What about the medicine?

11:36.361 --> 11:38.625
Mr. Luthor took all of it.

11:41.466 --> 11:43.195
Then get it back.

11:45.437 --> 11:49.203
-I've only got 1 2 hours. You know that!
-He won't help you, Adam.

11:49.374 --> 11:51.467
He doesn't even know you're alive.

11:51.643 --> 11:54.203
I have no idea
where he's taking the serum.

11:55.781 --> 12:00.150
-I'm sorry.
-Then what am I supposed to do?

12:13.298 --> 12:16.699
Look, Clark, I'm no expert on
quantum tunneling or wormholes...

12:16.868 --> 12:20.964
...but if minds like Einstein and Thorne
believe time anomalies are possible...

12:21.139 --> 12:22.367
...who am I to rule it out?

12:22.541 --> 12:26.068
Lex, if that phone call is gonna happen
tonight, we need to find Adam.

12:27.045 --> 12:29.946
Clark, what makes you think I can help?

12:30.749 --> 12:32.842
Because you were at the lab.

12:33.618 --> 12:35.609
And I know you met with Dr. Teng.

12:39.424 --> 12:41.722
Clark, what have you been doing?

12:41.893 --> 12:45.420
-Following me?
-Don't turn this around on me, LeX.

12:45.797 --> 12:48.698
Look, we think Adam died of liver disease
a few months ago...

12:48.867 --> 12:52.268
...and I'm guessing he was
one of Dr. Teng's subjects.

12:53.472 --> 12:56.999
Lana's in trouble and I know
you're holding out on me.

13:00.746 --> 13:02.771
Where is he, LeX?

13:07.219 --> 13:09.312
You don't want anything
to happen to Lana.

13:09.488 --> 13:12.548
I know you don't. Please.

13:17.763 --> 13:19.924
Trust me, Clark.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.532
There's no way Adam's
gonna come after Lana.

13:22.701 --> 13:25.397
-How can you be so sure?
-Because he can't leave the lab.

13:26.538 --> 13:29.166
He needs constant injections
just to stay alive.

13:32.844 --> 13:34.709
I need to see it with my own eyes.

13:35.614 --> 13:38.208
It's a secured lab.
You'll never be able to get in there.

13:39.418 --> 13:41.511
Not without you.

14:50.088 --> 14:51.783
LeX.

14:56.962 --> 14:58.930
Adam's gone.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.241
Was it worth it?

15:17.582 --> 15:21.313
Sacrificing the lives of Dr. Teng
and all those technicians...

15:21.620 --> 15:24.054
...just to get back into
the pharmaceutical business.

15:24.856 --> 15:28.155
I hope you weren't as emotional
as this with the police.

15:28.326 --> 15:30.988
I just spent the last five hours
covering for you.

15:31.630 --> 15:35.566
I appreciate the gesture, but I told you,
I had nothing to do with the lab at Metron.

15:35.934 --> 15:39.165
I suppose you didn't have anything
to do with those murders either.

15:39.604 --> 15:43.904
LeX, even if I were the demonic father
you make me out to be...

15:44.075 --> 15:46.737
...you know I would never
do anything so sloppy.

15:48.914 --> 15:50.643
But I'm not worried, son.

15:53.451 --> 15:55.146
How can you be so cavalier?

15:55.320 --> 15:59.586
Because I know that I have someone
extremely competent in charge.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.698
You wanted the project.

16:08.967 --> 16:10.298
It's yours.

16:12.571 --> 16:15.165
I'm trusting you to handle things.

16:24.549 --> 16:26.813
Nice try, Dad.

16:26.985 --> 16:29.317
But I'm not suiting up in the 1 1 th hour.

16:32.657 --> 16:35.455
Clean up your own mess.

16:51.276 --> 16:55.007
I thought I was used to seeing weird things
around here, but this was a massacre.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.239
What about Adam?

16:57.415 --> 16:59.713
It looks like he escaped.

17:00.485 --> 17:02.817
But you think he killed them.

17:02.988 --> 17:05.923
He obviously escaped from his cell
and strangled his doctor.

17:06.090 --> 17:08.616
Looks like the other victims
were trying to stop him.

17:08.792 --> 17:11.921
Hey, guys. So after I promised
to switch my long-distance service...

17:12.097 --> 17:15.828
...I got the phone company to track down
the blocked number you called from.

17:16.101 --> 17:17.534
Whose was it?

17:18.169 --> 17:20.467
It's from a cell phone
belonging to Gwen Burton.

17:20.638 --> 17:22.732
Does that ring a bell?

17:24.809 --> 17:27.936
No. I have no idea who that is.

17:28.113 --> 17:31.378
-Why would I make a call from her phone?
-I don't know.

17:31.549 --> 17:35.713
But we can rack up one more for our "Can
you hear me 24 hours from now? " theory.

17:35.887 --> 17:39.687
I looked into Mrs. Burton's phone records
and there were no outgoing calls last night.

17:39.858 --> 17:42.918
It's like the call you received
came out of thin air.

17:43.194 --> 17:45.822
Or a really different time zone.

17:46.097 --> 17:48.998
Look, at least this gives us an advantage.

17:51.102 --> 17:52.694
We know what's supposed to happen.

17:52.871 --> 17:56.398
We have to keep Adam away from Lana
and make sure you don't get that phone.

17:56.574 --> 18:00.032
-But Adam could be anywhere.
-It's safer if we get you out to the farm.

18:02.380 --> 18:05.315
Clark, what if we can't
stop this from happening?

18:20.565 --> 18:22.396
Mrs. Burton?

18:22.567 --> 18:25.695
This is a strange question,
but I work at the Teen Crisis Hotline...

18:25.870 --> 18:29.067
...and we got a call from this number
last night. Is it yours?

18:29.641 --> 18:33.008
I didn't make any calls last night.
Sorry, there must be some mistake.

18:33.178 --> 18:34.543
Would you know an Adam Knight?

18:34.713 --> 18:36.078
He used to be a patient here.

18:36.247 --> 18:38.511
We don't get many patients
in Accounts Receivable.

18:38.683 --> 18:41.151
Look, Mrs. Burton,
I don't know how to eXplain this...

18:41.319 --> 18:44.846
...but I think your phone's gonna be
used in a crime. Tonight.

18:45.824 --> 18:49.021
-What did you say your name was?
-Clark Kent.

18:49.194 --> 18:51.526
Clark, we have an excellent
psychiatric staff here.

18:51.696 --> 18:53.823
I'd be happy to take you
to the admitting desk.

18:54.199 --> 18:57.657
I know I sound crazy, but is there
a chance you lost your phone?

18:59.804 --> 19:02.466
Actually, I lent it to my husband today.

19:02.640 --> 19:05.336
He had to run some errands in Metropolis.

19:05.543 --> 19:08.478
Would you call him, please?

19:25.997 --> 19:27.965
-Hello.
-Hi, honey...

19:28.133 --> 19:30.567
...there's some kid here
asking about the cell phone.

19:30.735 --> 19:32.464
What, they come in person now?

19:32.637 --> 19:36.869
-Just tell him we're happy with our plan.
-Ask him where he is.

19:37.108 --> 19:40.976
-Where are you?
-I'm stuck outside the city on Route 1 7.

19:41.146 --> 19:42.670
I got a flat, but I should be--

19:44.749 --> 19:46.046
Len?

19:46.217 --> 19:48.947
Len? Len--

19:55.059 --> 19:57.391
He's not answering.

20:16.247 --> 20:18.078
Are you okay?

20:18.583 --> 20:20.983
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-What happened?

20:21.152 --> 20:24.053
Some kid just carjacked me.
He looked like a junkie.

20:24.222 --> 20:25.712
Did you see which way he went?

20:28.660 --> 20:31.595
No. I must have been out for a minute.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.358
I need to call the police.

20:38.536 --> 20:40.970
You don't have your cell phone, do you?

20:42.207 --> 20:43.834
No.

21:03.228 --> 21:05.093
Here you go, Lana.

21:05.263 --> 21:08.824
I know this old house can get drafty
and I'm sure Mrs. Kent won't mind.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.900
Thanks, Mr. Kent. I really appreciate it.

21:11.069 --> 21:15.267
-Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'll tell them.
-What did Clark say?

21:15.440 --> 21:19.069
He missed Adam by a few minutes
and Adam has the cell phone.

21:23.815 --> 21:25.248
It's all starting to come true.

21:26.784 --> 21:28.843
The storm.

21:29.020 --> 21:30.885
The phone.

21:32.223 --> 21:34.214
Don't you worry, Lana.

21:34.425 --> 21:36.950
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

21:39.864 --> 21:42.128
I'm not doing any good just standing here.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.393
The police are looking
for the stolen vehicle.

21:44.569 --> 21:47.299
Any leads are gonna come through
the scanner at the Torch.

21:47.472 --> 21:50.168
Here, Chloe, I want you to take my truck.

21:51.042 --> 21:53.704
The last thing we need is you
getting stuck in a creek.

21:53.878 --> 21:55.106
Thank you.

21:55.280 --> 21:59.649
Lana, it's gonna be okay. We've got lots
of time. The game hasn't even started yet.

22:08.026 --> 22:10.426
Keep me posted.

22:10.595 --> 22:12.688
Still no leads on Adam.

22:12.864 --> 22:15.560
-What about the serum?
-What about it?

22:15.733 --> 22:19.191
Adam knows it's keeping him alive.
He's gotta go after more of it.

22:19.537 --> 22:21.801
Problem is, there's no more serum
for him to find.

22:21.973 --> 22:25.374
You know your father didn't get rid of it.
He must have a stash somewhere.

22:27.912 --> 22:29.709
Detective Cage, Metropolis P.D.

22:29.881 --> 22:32.247
We have a warrant to search the premises.

22:32.417 --> 22:35.909
-On what grounds?
-Eight possible counts of negligent homicide.

22:36.554 --> 22:38.920
Why don't you take a load off.

22:40.024 --> 22:42.185
We'll just make ourselves at home.

22:43.861 --> 22:45.590
I'm sorry, Clark, but you better go.

22:46.664 --> 22:50.657
-I don't want you getting involved in this.
-Unfortunately, he already is.

22:50.835 --> 22:53.599
Seeing as how Mr. Kent was
also at the scene of the crime...

22:53.771 --> 22:56.501
...we'd like to ask
him a few questions too.

23:17.528 --> 23:20.258
-Where's Lana?
-I don't know. I'm not her keeper.

23:20.798 --> 23:22.265
Don't lie to me.

23:22.433 --> 23:25.925
I was just at the Talon, they said
you and Lana left together. Where is she?

23:26.471 --> 23:27.938
Why do you care so much?

23:31.209 --> 23:35.077
-She's got something that belongs to me.
-Well, it's obviously not here.

23:35.246 --> 23:39.273
And if I were you, I wouldn't be either.
Everybody's looking for you.

23:46.658 --> 23:49.149
Isn't that Clark's truck?

23:49.560 --> 23:51.994
No, it's my cousin's.

23:53.398 --> 23:57.334
Something tells me that's not
what the registration's gonna say.

23:59.170 --> 24:00.797
You're covering for her.

24:02.740 --> 24:04.537
Where is she?

24:04.709 --> 24:07.109
Is she hiding at her old boyfriend's?

24:07.512 --> 24:09.377
No!

24:11.849 --> 24:13.749
Don't worry.

24:13.918 --> 24:16.785
You'll be able to talk to her soon enough.

24:20.058 --> 24:24.552
I'm sure when Mrs. Kent gets home
she'll whip you up one of her specialties.

24:24.729 --> 24:27.527
-Until then, I'm afraid it's just black coffee.
-Thanks.

24:27.699 --> 24:30.827
-I have some honey.
-No, I'm good.

24:33.671 --> 24:35.969
Sounds like my truck.

24:41.546 --> 24:43.013
Yeah, it's Chloe.

24:44.115 --> 24:45.548
Why isn't she coming inside?

24:46.651 --> 24:48.118
I don't know.

24:53.324 --> 24:56.020
Why don't you lock the door behind me.

25:15.113 --> 25:17.479
Go back in the house!

25:20.518 --> 25:24.545
-Please be careful, Mr. Kent. Please!
-Chloe?

25:24.722 --> 25:26.815
Mr. Kent! No!

25:37.468 --> 25:39.834
-Come on!
-Get away from me.

25:51.249 --> 25:54.548
Lana! I know you're in there!

25:54.719 --> 25:57.620
If you don't come out,
I'll kill your boyfriend's father!

25:58.422 --> 26:01.357
Then I'll move on to Chloe!

26:04.529 --> 26:06.497
Adam!

26:06.664 --> 26:10.657
Whatever you want,
just don't hurt them any more!

26:20.144 --> 26:23.011
-Please, just don't hurt them.
-Come on.

26:23.181 --> 26:25.741
Just leave them alone, please. Oh, God.

26:25.917 --> 26:30.013
Hurry up. Let's go.
Shut up and get in the truck.

26:36.561 --> 26:39.997
You're gonna stand there and tell me
you weren't working with Dr. Teng?

26:40.164 --> 26:41.859
You can't deny you're behind this.

26:42.033 --> 26:44.194
I'm the one who called the ambulance.

26:44.368 --> 26:47.303
Now, why would I do that
if I was involved in those murders?

26:47.471 --> 26:51.202
Well, let's see what we got
in the goodie bag.

26:52.410 --> 26:54.241
Nothing that will incriminate me.

27:01.419 --> 27:05.287
Except some memo signed by you
as acting director of the lab.

27:09.694 --> 27:12.663
-I've never seen these before.
-Amazing how that always happens.

27:15.366 --> 27:18.665
-I'm being set up.
-Then they're doing a damn good job of it.

27:19.470 --> 27:21.267
Take a breather.

27:21.439 --> 27:24.408
Think about if you wanna
stick to that story.

27:26.110 --> 27:27.372
You have to let me go.

27:27.545 --> 27:30.742
Your friend's been running off at the mouth
for an hour fessing up...

27:30.915 --> 27:33.315
-...so don't try and play the hero.
-You're bluffing.

27:33.484 --> 27:36.180
He didn't admit to anything
because he didn't do anything.

27:36.354 --> 27:37.719
You really think that?

27:38.122 --> 27:40.852
You don't know your friend as well
as you think you do.

27:41.425 --> 27:45.327
Hey, Paul. The Vipers just took Roberts
off the court. He blew out his knee.

27:45.496 --> 27:48.260
Guess who's off the bench
with five minutes in the fourth quarter.

27:48.432 --> 27:51.265
-Gunnerson.
-Yeah.

27:51.435 --> 27:54.768
That guy throws more bricks
than a mason.

27:54.939 --> 27:57.737
-I have to go.
-Were we keeping you from something?

27:57.909 --> 27:59.433
Have you called my parents yet?

28:00.177 --> 28:01.405
Yeah, no one's answered.

28:01.579 --> 28:03.570
The newspapers
would find it interesting...

28:03.748 --> 28:07.149
...that a minor was being held
for questioning without his guardian.

28:08.853 --> 28:10.980
I wouldn't take any long vacations.

28:11.155 --> 28:14.181
We may need to bring you in
for more questioning.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.559
Damn.

28:25.069 --> 28:28.061
Vipers lead 52 to 46 but the momentum....

28:31.342 --> 28:34.140
Denali dribbles up the court,
passes to Weir in the low post.

28:34.312 --> 28:37.907
Weir fakes right, he shoots,
but Armaganian takes it off the rim.

28:38.082 --> 28:39.674
There's a long throw to Matthews--

28:39.850 --> 28:42.944
-Which one is it?
-lt' s over here.

28:43.187 --> 28:46.748
Hurry up. Come on.

28:47.658 --> 28:49.455
Faster.

28:55.800 --> 28:59.327
-I put everything in these boXes over here.
-Where are my books?

28:59.503 --> 29:01.937
-I don't know which one I put them in.
-Well, look.

29:08.112 --> 29:11.548
Hurry up.
I don't have a lot of time, Lana.

29:13.851 --> 29:16.115
The white one. The white one.

29:19.890 --> 29:22.358
-Where is it?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

29:22.526 --> 29:25.461
I had three vials in there!
What did you do with them?

29:25.629 --> 29:27.494
-I didn't touch them.
-You liar!

30:06.871 --> 30:10.238
Takes it down for the Metros.
He cuts around Miller, goes up for two.

30:10.408 --> 30:11.739
What happened?

30:11.909 --> 30:14.742
I came home and found your father
and Chloe outside.

30:14.912 --> 30:16.243
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

30:16.414 --> 30:18.712
Adam has Lana
and he has your dad's gun.

30:20.117 --> 30:22.745
The police are looking for him now.

30:22.920 --> 30:25.855
-Do you know which way they headed?
-I don't know.

30:26.023 --> 30:29.550
Adam keeps saying that Lana
has something of his.

30:29.760 --> 30:31.523
-The serum.
-I don't know.

30:31.695 --> 30:34.687
He went to the Talon and the house.
I don't know where they'd go.

30:34.865 --> 30:38.801
I'm going to the youth center. All we're
sure of is that Lana's gonna make that call.

30:38.969 --> 30:41.403
Clark, what good is that?
You've heard the call.

30:41.572 --> 30:44.564
It was cutting in and out.
We could barely hear half of it.

30:44.742 --> 30:48.439
If I figure out why it was placed to the past,
maybe I can stop it from happening.

30:48.612 --> 30:51.046
You think Lana will be able
to tell you where she is?

30:51.215 --> 30:54.343
--but he's blocked by Grier.
Boardner passes it out to Johnson.

30:54.518 --> 30:56.952
Johnson goes for the three-pointer
and he sinks it!

30:57.121 --> 30:58.383
What's the score?

30:58.556 --> 31:00.786
Vipers up by two, 61 to 59.

31:00.958 --> 31:04.450
-There's three seconds left in the game.
-61 -59.

31:04.628 --> 31:06.357
Vipers.

31:10.134 --> 31:12.227
Lana!

31:15.906 --> 31:17.931
Lana!

31:18.142 --> 31:21.805
-Oh, damn it.
-Lana!

31:38.729 --> 31:40.754
-Lana!
-Clark!

31:40.931 --> 31:42.956
-Lana!
-Please, help me--

31:53.110 --> 31:54.338
Clark, it's happening.

31:56.013 --> 32:01.178
-Three seconds left. Gunnerson dribbles....
-He's got a gun!

32:01.352 --> 32:05.152
It's good! That makes the score
64 to 60, Vipers.

32:13.197 --> 32:17.566
-Please help me!
-Lana! Lana!

32:36.053 --> 32:37.714
Clark!

32:44.628 --> 32:47.426
Clark, why aren't you picking up?

32:56.974 --> 32:59.169
Clark! He's trying to kill me!

32:59.343 --> 33:00.901
Please help me!

33:01.312 --> 33:02.540
Clark!

33:05.416 --> 33:06.678
Help me!

33:09.286 --> 33:11.550
-Please, help me!
-Lana!

33:11.722 --> 33:12.984
-Clark!
-You lied to me!

33:13.691 --> 33:17.320
-Lana, where are you?
-I'm at Walcott Storage! Help me!

33:49.026 --> 33:50.618
Lana?

33:52.796 --> 33:54.855
-Are you okay?
-Where's Adam?

34:09.446 --> 34:11.744
You took that bullet.

34:12.850 --> 34:14.373
That's impossible.

34:14.551 --> 34:15.916
I saw you.

34:18.054 --> 34:20.956
Now I know why Lionel sent me
to watch you.

34:22.559 --> 34:25.357
Guess I found what I was looking for...

34:26.597 --> 34:28.827
...just a little too late.

34:29.867 --> 34:31.527
Adam.

34:32.536 --> 34:34.594
He's not gonna stop, Clark.

34:35.973 --> 34:38.271
I couldn't escape him.

34:39.275 --> 34:41.801
How long do you think you can?

35:18.315 --> 35:20.783
-Let's go.
-FBl.

35:21.552 --> 35:26.046
Why don't you boys hit the showers.
This case has been bumped up to varsity.

35:26.223 --> 35:28.748
That's just like you guys.

35:28.926 --> 35:33.989
We do the heavy lifting
and you just show up for the prize.

35:37.801 --> 35:40.463
This better be important.

35:40.904 --> 35:44.567
Your lawyer may have friends
in high places...

35:44.808 --> 35:47.971
...but I'm not a believer
in the trickle-down theory.

35:49.179 --> 35:51.147
I wanna make a deal.

35:52.983 --> 35:56.749
Why should I do that? I understand
they're building a strong case against you.

35:56.920 --> 36:01.084
As flattered as I am to be the object
of so much attention...

36:01.258 --> 36:03.818
...you and I both know
I'm only the consolation prize.

36:05.129 --> 36:07.996
-I'm listening.
-Tell the cops to drop the charges...

36:08.165 --> 36:10.156
...and give me immunity...

36:10.701 --> 36:13.761
...and I'll give you
the biggest arrest of your career.

36:15.406 --> 36:17.101
What are we talking about?

36:25.449 --> 36:28.043
I'll help you bring down my father.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.856
I must admit, I'm intrigued by the research.

36:39.029 --> 36:40.997
What happened to your
last project manager?

36:41.165 --> 36:42.632
She...

36:42.800 --> 36:44.791
...moved on.

36:45.836 --> 36:48.361
And please understand me, Dr. Bergin...

36:48.539 --> 36:52.942
...I will spare no eXpense on this project.

36:53.110 --> 36:54.839
You onboard?

36:55.646 --> 36:59.912
With the limited amount of serum you have,
there's barely enough for one round of trials.

37:00.083 --> 37:04.144
Well, that's why I'm counting on you
to get it right the first time.

37:05.622 --> 37:11.583
Well, I suppose I could have a lab outfitted
and a trial underway within a year.

37:11.762 --> 37:15.630
Dr. Bergin, I want you up and running
by the end of the week.

37:15.799 --> 37:17.596
A project like this requires time.

37:17.768 --> 37:21.135
Time is a luXury I don't have, doctor.

37:21.305 --> 37:23.671
I have been...

37:23.841 --> 37:27.709
...diagnosed with a rather unique...

37:28.345 --> 37:32.008
...Iiver disease and I'm out of options.

37:41.725 --> 37:43.522
Any luck?

37:44.194 --> 37:48.460
No. I.... I got lost at the first wormhole.

37:48.632 --> 37:52.398
The world's scientists are still debating
over Einstein's theories of time travel.

37:52.569 --> 37:55.402
I don't think we're gonna crack it
in one night.

37:57.040 --> 38:00.441
Clark, there's still something
I don't understand.

38:00.611 --> 38:03.978
How did you get from the hotline
to the storage unit in a split second?

38:06.283 --> 38:09.116
Took me more than a few seconds.

38:11.755 --> 38:14.690
Maybe it had something to do
with the weird time anomaly.

38:18.929 --> 38:21.762
You know, there's something
that I don't understand either.

38:21.932 --> 38:25.459
Why did you call the hotline
instead of the police?

38:25.636 --> 38:27.604
Because...

38:28.372 --> 38:30.772
...I knew you'd be there.

38:34.411 --> 38:36.902
Looks like we cheated fate.

38:37.080 --> 38:38.308
Barely.

38:41.685 --> 38:44.153
I was so afraid that
I wouldn't get to you in time.

38:46.723 --> 38:48.350
I know.

38:48.525 --> 38:53.929
I spent the last 24 hours terrified
of what might happen.

38:54.665 --> 38:56.189
But it all turned out okay.

38:58.669 --> 39:00.796
It made me realize
how many decisions I make...

39:00.971 --> 39:03.735
...because I'm scared
of how things will end up.

39:04.575 --> 39:07.169
We both do our share of that.

39:12.783 --> 39:16.082
Maybe it's time to stop being so afraid.

39:19.122 --> 39:25.220
I've always thought that my life
is so mapped out for me...

39:25.462 --> 39:29.023
...but, you know, maybe we have
more control over the future than we think.
