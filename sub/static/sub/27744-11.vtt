Why can't you wear the earphones
you bought with my credit card?

01:15.533 --> 01:17.619
They keep getting lost in my hair.

01:17.702 --> 01:21.081
Now, if you would please be so kind
as to pump up my jam.

01:21.539 --> 01:22.874
[Grace] Just skip to the end.

01:22.957 --> 01:24.667
What's happening?

01:25.794 --> 01:28.630
I'm keeping our promise
to all the ladies out there.

01:28.713 --> 01:30.173
This is the donut portion.

Do you remember how many women
retweeted you? Fifty thousand.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.597
What will you do? Make 50,000
donuts at 3 in the morning?

01:37.680 --> 01:42.102
I already made two dozen,
so you, uh, do the math, smart guy.

01:44.395 --> 01:46.606
This is a bagel covered with sugar.

01:46.689 --> 01:49.025
It's our powdered pumpernickel.

Necessity is the mother of invention,
Grace.

01:51.903 --> 01:52.862

Frankie, this is not a problem
that can be solved

02:08.336 --> 02:11.965
Go to bed and tomorrow
we'll work out a solution.

02:12.048 --> 02:15.135
Don't worry. I've gotten out
of tighter spots than this.

02:15.218 --> 02:18.138
Like the time I got stuck
in Brian Wilson's bathroom.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.431

enough on his plate.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.684
Grace, I'm sorry I woke you up.

02:22.767 --> 02:25.854
I know you have to be up early,
but I've got this.

02:26.396 --> 02:29.482
I don't actually have to be up early.
I'm...

02:30.567 --> 02:32.110
I'm leaving Say Grace.

02:32.819 --> 02:33.820
Word?

02:33.903 --> 02:37.365
After great deliberation,
I have decided to step down...

02:37.448 --> 02:39.450
to spend less time with my family.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.703
Wow, that's huge.

02:41.786 --> 02:42.787
I know.

Are you okay?

02:45.456 --> 02:46.791
Mm-hmm.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.919
Great. Then grab some dough
and get fryin'.

02:59.387 --> 03:02.724
The market was closed,
but I bought out the 7-Eleven.

03:02.807 --> 03:04.934
[sighs] Oh, yeah.

03:30.835 --> 03:33.254
-What?
-You're hitting me in your sleep!

03:33.338 --> 03:35.173
Oh, my God.

Do you think that's why
I was dreaming I was hitting you?

Sol...

03:46.392 --> 03:50.313
I am sorry I lost your dog.
I don't know what else to do.

03:50.396 --> 03:53.983
I've apologized a hundred times,
both to you and Carl.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.069
I took you both out to dinner.

03:56.152 --> 03:59.197
That dog-friendly tapas bar was a find.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.367
You think I don't care about Carl,
but I was devastated.

04:02.450 --> 04:05.078
I was running
all over the neighborhood like a madman

04:05.161 --> 04:08.248
because I thought I'd lost
your third adopted child.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.917
That must've been really scary for you.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.502
It was.

04:12.585 --> 04:15.672
I even started crying
in front of Mr. Purcelli.

04:15.755 --> 04:18.049
Though, that was probably the weed.

04:18.758 --> 04:22.512
So, that's the other thing
I can't get my head around.

04:23.012 --> 04:26.266
After a lifetime of listening
to Andy Williams

04:26.349 --> 04:28.893
and saying things like "horse feathers,"

04:29.811 --> 04:34.065
why did you suddenly decide
to get high with my ex-wife?

04:34.691 --> 04:36.192
[chuckles]
I don't know.

that maybe it's all added up to nothing?

-God, you're Irish.
-[scoffs]

04:48.413 --> 04:49.497
Talk to me, husband.

04:51.291 --> 04:55.044
These were supposed to be the years
I thought I could do whatever I wanted.

04:55.336 --> 04:59.549
But I sleep with a machine on my face,
and I can't drink liquor or eat pizza.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.926
I'm playing the pudgy sidekick.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.221
Although, according to Peter,
I can't even do that right.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.016
So I thought, "Why not?
I'll try and get high."

05:08.641 --> 05:09.976
Oh, God.

I'm sorry.

05:18.985 --> 05:22.822

I just didn't know how hard.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.407
Yeah.

05:24.490 --> 05:27.285
We need to spend some time together,
just you and me.

05:27.368 --> 05:28.328
Mm.

05:28.619 --> 05:32.206
Why don't I take you out to dinner
tomorrow night after rehearsal?

05:33.791 --> 05:37.295
I know a great dog-friendly tapas bar.

05:38.463 --> 05:42.383
I'm pretty sure
the health department's closing them down.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.676
What?

05:43.760 --> 05:45.303
We were there last night.

05:45.386 --> 05:46.679
Yeah.

05:47.221 --> 05:49.599
I called the health department.

[wind chime jingling]

[Nick]
Need your opinion on something.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.236
[Grace] Whoa.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.321
Thoughts?

06:03.821 --> 06:04.947
Compliments?

06:05.865 --> 06:07.742
[Grace] Nick, that is very funny,

06:07.825 --> 06:10.703
but Frankie gets mad
when people unwrap her turbans.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.539
What? No, this is a sarong

06:13.623 --> 06:16.042
for our trip to the Maldives.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.252
It's what everyone wears, I assume.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.296
I've never actually left the resort.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.007
Well, you may not get a chance to.

06:23.841 --> 06:26.761
No, no, no! You're not canceling.

06:26.844 --> 06:29.555
I'm not. I'm-- I'm... postponing.

06:29.639 --> 06:33.184
No, no. You're not postponing
just 'cause you're worried about Frankie.

06:33.267 --> 06:36.646
I'm afraid that while we're away
she'll sell Vybrant for magic beans,

06:36.729 --> 06:38.523
which is what she calls Tropical Skittles.

06:38.606 --> 06:39.857
They are hard to find.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.819
I'm sorry, Nick.
I really want to go away with you.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.113
I've been looking forward
to this for weeks.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.073
[Grace sighs]

06:47.156 --> 06:49.492
I've been waiting so long
to go on this trip with you.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.746
I've been extremely patient with Frankie
and sensitive to your relationship,

06:53.830 --> 06:55.998
but sometimes you need to choose me.

06:56.707 --> 06:58.209
I know.

06:58.876 --> 07:01.045
This is Frankie's mess.
Let her clean it up.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.256
Yeah,  [scoffs]...
but her mess is my mess.

07:04.715 --> 07:05.716
Fine.

07:07.301 --> 07:08.803
Then you need to fire Buff.

07:09.595 --> 07:10.430
Huh?

07:11.013 --> 07:12.098
Buff McDoogle.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.391
Who's Buff McDoogle?

07:13.474 --> 07:15.435
Oh, I don't know. Some horrible white guy?

07:15.518 --> 07:16.811
What?

07:16.894 --> 07:20.356
Every time I have a "business whoopsie,"
rather than take the blame,

07:20.440 --> 07:24.026
I invent a fictional scapegoat
and fire them publicly.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.904
Makes the investors happy,
gets me off the hook.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.573
America.

07:28.656 --> 07:31.534
I told Frankie she wasn't allowed
to invent people anymore,

07:31.617 --> 07:34.370
so it would be
really hypocritical if I did.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.956
Then your only option
is to issue a formal apology.

07:37.039 --> 07:39.917
Make a video
in which you own up to the mistake

07:40.376 --> 07:42.879
and pledge to do better by your customers.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.755
You mean use vague,
non-committal words

07:44.839 --> 07:48.050
to convey mutual regret
without assuming responsibility

07:48.134 --> 07:51.220
that could in any way
have legal implications.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.472
That's my girl.

07:52.555 --> 07:53.431
[sighs]

07:53.556 --> 07:56.100
You really shouldn't
sit like that in a skirt.

07:59.061 --> 08:02.482
Oh, my God, Liz, that was so good.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.109
Oh, thanks.
I'm glad we could have you over.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.737
We should really do more of this--

08:07.820 --> 08:09.530
Because we're having a baby.

08:09.614 --> 08:10.448
[chuckles]

08:10.531 --> 08:13.159
Really throwing that "we" around.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.327
Okay.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.829
Uh, speaking of the baby,
I'll go go outside, have a smoke.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.373
-Probably the last one for a while.
-I'm gonna come with you,

08:19.457 --> 08:20.958
try to shame you into not having it.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.586
-You really haven't changed since college.
-[Barry chuckles]

08:23.669 --> 08:25.922
I paid my friends
to throw their cigarettes away.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.341
-It's how I got my nickname, Fuck Off.
-[Liz and Barry chuckle]

08:29.342 --> 08:33.095
I told Erin that when she's pregnant
I won't drink either, in solidarity.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.432
So, I'm gonna have to do
a lot of drinking in the shed.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.101
That's so sweet.
I hide my life from Barry, too.

08:39.185 --> 08:42.688
You and Barry should come to one
of our couples' yoga classes sometime.

08:42.772 --> 08:46.776
It's kind of lame, but there's this loud
couple from Boston who hate each other.

08:46.859 --> 08:50.154
-It's worth checking out.
-I would love to, but Fuck Off...

08:50.238 --> 08:52.490
screams pretty loud during yoga.

08:52.573 --> 08:56.118
Though, if you guys are ever gently
feeding Ezekiel bread to ducks

08:56.202 --> 09:00.081
in a sparsely populated park
while telling pigeons it's not for them...

09:00.790 --> 09:01.874
he's your man.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.669
No wonder he and Erin
were so close in college.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.546
She's a pretty serious dork, too.

09:07.713 --> 09:08.839
She keeps a bird journal.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.800
Barf!

09:10.883 --> 09:15.221
Barry cried at the end of the
Julia Roberts movie<i> Conspiracy Theory.</i>

09:15.304 --> 09:16.847
Barf.

09:16.931 --> 09:17.932
[both chuckle]

09:18.015 --> 09:20.518
Erin still reads<i> Sweet Valley High</i> books.

09:20.601 --> 09:22.520
Okay, Barry names his bunions.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.897
And if you don't think one of them's
Paul Bunion...

09:24.981 --> 09:26.691
[softly]
...you're out of your mind.

09:26.774 --> 09:29.193
You win. You win.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.236
[Brianna] Thank you.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.704
Frankie! Frankie!

09:39.787 --> 09:40.788
Yep!

09:41.664 --> 09:45.042
Just finishing another batch
of kept promises.

09:45.126 --> 09:48.629
Frankie, this has got to stop.
Okay, clearly you have not slept at all.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.424
And you're eating more donuts
than you're shipping.

09:51.507 --> 09:53.134
Where is Joan-Margaret?

09:53.217 --> 09:54.969
Unclear at this time.

09:55.052 --> 10:00.683
But don't worry, I've got a plan that is
so simple, even you will understand it.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.518
Let me get my whiteboard.

10:02.602 --> 10:06.564
Oh, Frankie, I swear to God, if there are
robot schematics on that thing...

10:07.398 --> 10:09.025
Even better.

10:09.775 --> 10:12.987
Oh, good, just a crazy flow chart
no one can follow.

10:13.070 --> 10:16.574
It all came to me
in a dream I had while I was working.

10:16.657 --> 10:20.703
How do we make 50,000 vibrators

10:20.786 --> 10:24.123
in only a fraction of the time
it normally takes?

10:24.206 --> 10:25.499
Simple.

10:25.583 --> 10:29.211
Use the stuff I find on the beach.

10:29.879 --> 10:34.216
Not only will it save time
not waiting for the manufacturer,

10:34.300 --> 10:37.053
it will cut costs for the supplier.

10:37.136 --> 10:42.099
That's us. Cost plus time equals synergy.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.393
Dynamism.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.021
Please, no questions.

10:48.272 --> 10:52.068
Frankie, enough. We are not sourcing
material from beach garbage.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.362
-[Frankie trills]
-You've got to stop

and admit
that this just... It's not possible.

10:56.906 --> 11:00.534
You're right. It isn't possible... for us.

11:00.618 --> 11:05.790
But it is possible
for this vibrator donut-making... robot!

11:06.457 --> 11:08.250
Oh, dear mother of God.

11:08.334 --> 11:12.421
I know. I spent a lot of time
getting her eyebrows just right.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.174
Frankie, let me lay a few facts on you.

11:17.343 --> 11:22.973
You promised free vibrators
to 50,000 women, right?

11:23.557 --> 11:27.645
Okay, if you could ship
20 vibrators a day, [scoffs]...

11:27.728 --> 11:30.606
...a feat that you have
never once accomplished. [inhales]

11:30.690 --> 11:32.024
It would take you...

11:33.401 --> 11:37.988
2,500 days to fulfill all the orders.

11:38.072 --> 11:40.741
Don't try to hustle me
with that new math.

11:40.825 --> 11:44.495
If we do this, we're gonna go bankrupt.
Is that what you want?

11:44.578 --> 11:48.165
Look, do you want to help me
make this robot or not?

11:49.291 --> 11:52.461
Frankie... look. [exhales]

11:53.129 --> 11:56.257
Last time, I messed up and you fixed it.

11:56.924 --> 12:00.386
Now it's my turn to fix your mistake.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.763
I need you to trust me.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.766
That's what being
in a partnership means, okay?

12:05.850 --> 12:07.017
Please!

12:08.936 --> 12:10.020
Fine.

12:11.605 --> 12:13.607
We'll do it your way.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.401
Let me get my bong.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.738
[keyboard clacking]

12:18.821 --> 12:19.780
[knock on door]

12:21.240 --> 12:22.533
Well, it's off.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.493
-Paul Bunion?
-No, I talked to Erin.

12:24.577 --> 12:28.622
She and Liz,
they aren't gonna use my... stuff,

12:28.706 --> 12:32.042
so, uh... I'm not having a baby.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.629
-What happened?
-[sighs] I don't know.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.215
Erin was super vague
on the phone, you know?

12:38.299 --> 12:39.759
She seemed really uncomfortable.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.553
Like, I just...
I couldn't get much from her.

12:42.636 --> 12:44.221
Babe, I'm so sorry.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.265
I just don't know what could've happened.

12:46.348 --> 12:48.642
Everything was great at dinner and...

12:48.726 --> 12:50.686
I mean, did Liz say anything to you or...

12:51.604 --> 12:52.813
No.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.357
I mean, we just talked about girl stuff.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.860
Like what kind of girl stuff?

12:57.943 --> 12:59.737
I don't know.

12:59.820 --> 13:02.031
We poked a little fun at you and Erin.

13:02.114 --> 13:05.159
Like the way that you talk
about your partner.

13:05.242 --> 13:08.579
Like nothing, really. It was stupid stuff.

13:08.662 --> 13:10.122
Like what?

13:11.582 --> 13:13.417
[exhales] I don't know.

13:13.501 --> 13:17.046
I... might have mentioned

13:17.129 --> 13:19.548
that you cried during<i> Conspiracy Theory.</i>

13:19.632 --> 13:22.551
What else? I told her your shoes
are prescription.

13:22.635 --> 13:26.055
I... mentioned your nipple thing.

13:26.138 --> 13:29.058
-It was just stupid stuff.
-Why did you tell her that?

13:29.141 --> 13:31.477
Because nobody wants to just sit there

13:31.560 --> 13:34.230
and listen to me talk
about how much I love you. It's boring.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.982
This is it! This is why
they're not gonna have my baby.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.820
-Don't be ridiculous.
-What else could it be?

13:40.903 --> 13:42.196
They have us over for dinner,

13:42.279 --> 13:45.574
you say a bunch of weird shit about me
to Liz, and now it's off.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.618
Barry, I'll not take the blame for this.

13:47.701 --> 13:49.662
What about you?
What did you talk to Erin about?

13:49.745 --> 13:51.705
Nothing! I...

13:51.789 --> 13:55.543
I asked her if she loved<i> Pitch Perfect 3</i>
as much as I did.

13:55.626 --> 13:58.629
I told her about the mail-order DNA test.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.256
I explained the plot of<i> Pitch Perfect 3.</i>

14:00.339 --> 14:01.507
[Brianna] Ah-ha.

14:01.590 --> 14:05.636
The mail order DNA test
that confirms you're ten percent Jewish?

14:05.719 --> 14:06.887
It is not that.

14:06.971 --> 14:10.182
I mean, we found our answer.
Erin is a bona fide anti-Semite.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.602
Her grandfather co-founded
the Shoah Foundation,

14:13.686 --> 14:15.855
so, yeah, I guess she hates Jews.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.315
[scoffs] Thanks.

in a production of Starlight Express.

Really? I...

15:06.447 --> 15:08.991
Robert, this move that you're doing...

15:09.909 --> 15:12.328
This is a horrible move.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.539
Who told you to do this horrible move?

15:16.332 --> 15:17.166
You did.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.127
Do me a kindness.

15:20.210 --> 15:23.422
Just perform it in a way that doesn't
make me want to quit show business.

-I'll do my best.
-Thank you.

and left a note saying "no funeral,"

-You're on thin ice, too, lady!

15:58.248 --> 15:59.541
[mouths] Oh, sorry.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.418
[Peter] From the top.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.007
So you really think
this is the right move?

16:07.091 --> 16:08.342
Oh, trust me.

16:08.425 --> 16:11.345
And thanks again for helping us out
with this, Joan-Margaret.

Oh, not at all, dear.

16:12.972 --> 16:16.183
Gives me an opportunity
to flex the old muscle.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.185
You've directed before?

16:18.268 --> 16:21.271
Oh, for a time, you know, in the '70s.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.856
You've seen<i> Boogie Nights?</i>

16:22.940 --> 16:24.900
You worked on<i> Boogie Nights?</i>

16:25.818 --> 16:27.069
No.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.488
I'm gonna start in a wide shot

16:29.571 --> 16:33.242
and then move in to singles
on both of you.

16:33.909 --> 16:37.496
Now... how the fuck
do you turn this thing on?

16:38.205 --> 16:39.665
It's the on button.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.458
Oh! Right.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.961
So how do you wanna do this thing?

16:44.044 --> 16:46.630
-You wanna cry first or should I?
-What?

16:46.714 --> 16:49.049
No, we're gonna stick with the script.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.217
What script?

16:50.300 --> 16:52.678
The one I handed you yesterday,
remember?

16:53.804 --> 16:55.597
[scoffs] I gave you the script,

16:55.681 --> 16:58.350
and you said,
"I don't read scripts, scripts read me,"

16:58.434 --> 17:00.102
and then you sneezed in my mouth?

17:01.186 --> 17:02.938
Nothing?
[inhales]

17:03.689 --> 17:05.107
Okay, just follow my lead,

17:05.190 --> 17:07.985
and just hop in periodically
to emphasize a point here or there.

17:08.652 --> 17:12.197
Cool. Then I'll just blast them
with a few sweet power chords.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.700
Frankie, no! Frankie.

17:14.783 --> 17:16.744
No crying, no harmonica.

17:17.494 --> 17:21.040
I say, "Hello, I'm Grace Hanson,"

17:21.123 --> 17:23.459
then you say, "I'm Frankie Bergstein,"

17:23.542 --> 17:25.878
then together we say,

17:25.961 --> 17:27.796
"And we're Vybrant."

17:28.213 --> 17:29.465
-Can you handle that?
-[clears throat]

17:29.548 --> 17:32.468
Sure, but when do we say
we're sorry for what happened--

17:32.551 --> 17:33.469
Action!

17:35.471 --> 17:37.473
Hello. I'm Grace Hanson.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.477
Line.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.603
[sighs]

17:42.686 --> 17:43.687
[grace] Cut!

17:43.771 --> 17:46.648
Frankie, your line is
"I'm Frankie Bergstein."

17:46.732 --> 17:49.610
Can you please memorize that?
I need you to be off-script.

17:49.693 --> 17:52.571
I still haven't seen this alleged script.

17:54.782 --> 17:55.783
Here!

17:57.493 --> 17:58.494
[Joan-Margaret] Grace?

17:59.161 --> 18:01.497
I'll be the one who says cut.

18:02.289 --> 18:03.332
Is that okay?

18:03.415 --> 18:04.249
Sure.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.584
Thank you, dear.

18:06.376 --> 18:07.586

-And we're Vybrant.
-And we're Vybrant.

18:17.137 --> 18:21.433
We know you're upset about the promise
we made on National Vibrator Day.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.018
We're upset, too.

18:23.477 --> 18:27.231
But we at Vybrant are working tirelessly

18:27.314 --> 18:31.443
on dynamic solutions
so that together we can move--

18:31.527 --> 18:34.947
Get those free vibrators to you
as fast as possible.

18:35.030 --> 18:35.864
Frankie!

18:38.200 --> 18:39.201
[Joan-Margaret] Frankie.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.081
Dear, when you come onto my set,

18:44.790 --> 18:46.750
you do two things.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.877
You hit your marks

18:48.961 --> 18:50.420
and you know your lines.

18:51.755 --> 18:54.758
Now, let's all get on the same page

18:54.842 --> 18:57.177
before I start throwing chairs,

18:57.719 --> 18:58.720
shall we?

19:00.556 --> 19:01.515
[Joan Margaret groans]

19:02.057 --> 19:06.728
I think what Joan-Margaret is saying
is that we agreed to try it my way.

19:06.812 --> 19:11.441
Right, but this just seems like we're
saying things that don't mean anything.

19:11.525 --> 19:15.112
That's right. That's how we're
cleaning up the mess that you made

19:15.195 --> 19:18.615
without creating an even bigger mess
in the form of a lawsuit.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.618
So could we just try one take
where we stick to the script?

19:21.702 --> 19:23.662
-Yeah. Sure. Right. No problem.
-[sighs]

19:24.830 --> 19:25.956

19:44.391 --> 19:48.228
Okay, I'm liking it with the new blocking.

19:49.229 --> 19:50.731
And... windmill.

19:53.525 --> 19:54.526
Good!

19:56.695 --> 19:57.905
Now, Oliver.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.909
Uh... I'm sorry, wait. Uh...

20:01.992 --> 20:05.495
Peter, look, I know this was
a stroke of genius,

20:05.579 --> 20:08.624
but don't you think this staging
is a little distracting?

20:08.707 --> 20:11.168
I'm getting hit by the windmill,
for God's sakes.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.045
Yes! Perfect! Use it!

20:13.503 --> 20:15.923
-How do you propose I do that?
-[clears throat]

20:16.006 --> 20:19.635
The confusion, too. Use it. Use all of it.

20:24.264 --> 20:26.308
Oh. [sighs]

20:28.936 --> 20:29.978
[Sol] Peter, if I could...

20:30.062 --> 20:32.356
I actually have a note for you.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.775
A note? I'm sorry, Sol.

20:34.858 --> 20:39.988
I was not aware you had completed
14 months of post-baccalaureate work

20:40.072 --> 20:44.034
in stage direction from a school
that unfortunately lost its accreditation.

20:44.117 --> 20:45.702
I thought that was me.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.329
Oh, wait.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.538
Hmm.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.623
That was me!

20:49.706 --> 20:51.625
How about the next time
Jeff kicks you out,

20:51.708 --> 20:55.003
you pay for a hotel like a damn adult.

21:01.510 --> 21:02.344
Continue.

21:02.427 --> 21:07.516
Look, you need to go easier on Robert.
He's been having a hard time lately.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.851
I'm trying to get the best out of him.

21:09.935 --> 21:13.397
We don't just give out
participation trophies here, Sol.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.650
Well, actually, yes, we do.

21:16.733 --> 21:19.778
Clifford makes them, they are adorable,
but that is beside the point.

21:19.861 --> 21:22.614
Have you thought
that maybe your directing style

21:22.698 --> 21:26.368
is actually responsible
for Robert's listless performance?

21:26.451 --> 21:27.869
Um...

21:27.953 --> 21:30.163
I have definitely fucking not.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.416
Then you definitely fucking should.

21:32.499 --> 21:37.004
You just don't understand what I do
as a tyrannical director.

21:37.087 --> 21:39.965
Why don't you try being less of a tyrant
and more of a human being?

21:40.632 --> 21:43.135
You're treating your friend like shit...

21:44.136 --> 21:45.887
and he doesn't deserve it.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.433
Where is this coming from, Sol?

21:49.516 --> 21:53.145
I know this is foreign to you.
I'm standing up for my husband...

21:53.645 --> 21:57.566
a man you are lucky to have to direct.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.486
Really, he's doing this as a favor to you.

22:01.570 --> 22:02.487
A favor?

22:02.571 --> 22:05.073
A good director
would've made him Don Quixote.

22:05.741 --> 22:09.036
He shouldn't even be playing Sancho.

22:09.661 --> 22:10.746
You know what?

22:14.750 --> 22:15.751
You're right.

22:16.877 --> 22:17.919
[Robert humming]

22:18.003 --> 22:19.254
Robert?

22:20.088 --> 22:21.256
You're fired.

22:30.432 --> 22:33.602
<i>...as we move forward</i>
<i>to a brighter tomorrow.</i>

22:33.685 --> 22:35.270
<i>-Isn't that right, Frankie?</i>
<i>-Well--</i>

22:35.354 --> 22:37.606
<i>Thank you. And God bless.</i>

22:39.274 --> 22:41.443
[exhales]
Well, I have a few notes.

22:42.277 --> 22:45.113
First, it's not good and I hate it.

22:46.114 --> 22:49.368
Well, I think we both agree that
Joan-Margaret didn't direct<i> Boogie Nights.</i>

22:49.451 --> 22:51.703
But this will pay off, trust me.

22:51.787 --> 22:54.039
Fine.  [sighs]
So, what's next?

22:54.122 --> 22:55.374
What do you mean?

22:55.874 --> 22:58.835
We did the video, so now what?
What's the next step?

22:59.544 --> 23:02.047
There is no next step.
This is a one-step thing.

23:02.130 --> 23:06.259
But we said in the video
that we're working on dynamic solutions.

23:06.343 --> 23:09.429
What are the "dynamic solutions"?

23:09.513 --> 23:10.972
There are none.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.474
I don't understand.

23:12.557 --> 23:16.353
Remember when you promised Coyote
a mansion if he got straight A's?

23:16.436 --> 23:18.355
That was a dynamic solution.

23:18.438 --> 23:21.817
No, no, no. We are not going
to lie to our customers!

23:21.900 --> 23:24.403
Hey, hey, you said lie.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.071
That's your word.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.406
But we promised them--

23:27.489 --> 23:29.366
I didn't promise them anything. You did!

23:29.449 --> 23:32.994
And you know something, I am sick
and tired of having to bail you out.

23:33.078 --> 23:36.873
Oh, said the woman who wouldn't actually
bail me out when I bit that cowboy.

23:36.957 --> 23:39.042
It was a mounted police officer.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.670
And where
was your concern for our customers

23:41.753 --> 23:43.797
when you promised them
something you can't deliver on?

23:43.880 --> 23:46.007
Cut me some slack, I was high.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.510
Wait a minute. You...
[scoffs]

23:48.593 --> 23:51.847
You did something that could cost us
our company 'cause you were high?

23:51.930 --> 23:53.974
Yeah, that's what I just said.

23:57.060 --> 23:58.019
What are you doing?

23:58.687 --> 24:01.690
I'm doing what needed to be done.
I'm posting it.

24:04.317 --> 24:06.027
[groans]

24:10.866 --> 24:11.992
Hey, Liz.

24:12.075 --> 24:14.578
So, I think that I left, um...

24:14.661 --> 24:15.996
my nice blue...

24:18.498 --> 24:19.958
whatever at your place.

24:20.041 --> 24:22.294
I can't think of anything. I'm coming in.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.421
Please do.

24:25.505 --> 24:26.548
[door closes]

24:27.048 --> 24:28.300
So Barry told me what happened,

24:28.383 --> 24:31.470
and I know it's because I talked to Liz
and I ragged on Barry,

24:31.553 --> 24:34.389
and if I said anything
to change your minds,

24:34.473 --> 24:39.144
please do not listen to me
because I am an idiot and Barry is great.

24:39.227 --> 24:41.396
-[both chuckle]
-You are so sweet.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.399
-That is really not it at all.
-No. Nope.

24:44.483 --> 24:45.817
[sighs]

24:45.901 --> 24:47.277
[chuckles]

24:47.360 --> 24:48.987
Oh, thank God!

24:50.071 --> 24:51.072
I thought--

24:54.409 --> 24:56.745
Uh... it is because of the Jewish thing?

24:56.828 --> 24:59.080
-What? No. Oh, my God, no.
-No, no, no.

24:59.164 --> 25:03.418
No, it turns out that the first guy
that we asked to donate came through.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.754
Oh, good.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.634
Wait, Barry wasn't your first choice?

25:11.551 --> 25:13.053
Don't get me wrong, we love Barry,

25:13.136 --> 25:15.972
but there was this other friend
that I did Outward Bound with.

25:16.056 --> 25:19.434
We thought he was gonna move to Europe.
He realized he can model from anywhere.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.352
Yeah.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.772
Brianna, this guy is really something.

25:24.439 --> 25:26.483
He's just... [exhales]

25:26.566 --> 25:28.151
really something.

25:28.235 --> 25:30.153
His name is Cooper Bradley,
funnily enough.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.864
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-[Erin] Isn't that funny?

25:32.948 --> 25:35.700
So you tell Barry
that you're going to have a baby with him,

25:35.784 --> 25:37.118
then tell him to go fuck himself

25:37.202 --> 25:40.413
just because some other hot piece of semen
comes rolling along?

25:42.249 --> 25:45.001
-Just show her. I don't know.
-Okay. Which one?

25:47.462 --> 25:48.463
Mm-hmm.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.636
-Let me see.
-[Liz] Okay.

25:56.137 --> 25:57.931
All right. Yes, sure.

25:58.014 --> 26:00.559
Fine, if you like this sort of thing,
but...

26:01.268 --> 26:02.936
Wow. [sighs]

26:03.019 --> 26:06.147
Look, we love--
We love him. We do. We love Barry.

26:06.231 --> 26:08.441
But this guy's stuff, he's just...

26:09.693 --> 26:11.778
-It's primo.
-Mm-hmm.

26:11.861 --> 26:13.071
That's what it is.

26:15.031 --> 26:16.575
You want primo?

26:16.658 --> 26:20.495
Barry has never once hogged the bed.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.790
He rubs my feet at least three times
a week of his own volition.

26:23.873 --> 26:27.085
He calls his mother once a week
even though she's insufferable.

26:27.168 --> 26:29.796
He is smart, but he doesn't brag about it.

26:29.879 --> 26:32.132
He's handsome, but he doesn't act like it.

26:32.215 --> 26:34.718
And he cries at movies
like<i> Conspiracy Theory.</i>

26:34.801 --> 26:37.804
-It's not that we--
-This Cooper, though incredibly handsome,

26:37.887 --> 26:39.681
-please send me that picture...
-Sure.

26:39.764 --> 26:41.349
...is he a Barry?

26:42.309 --> 26:45.729
You guys are going to do
an amazing job at raising this kid,

26:45.812 --> 26:49.274
but it takes a village
as the should-be President once said.

26:49.357 --> 26:54.696
And should you need another person
in that village, Barry will be there.

26:56.239 --> 26:57.866
Will Cooper Bradley?

27:05.415 --> 27:08.835
And if there are any photos of him
on a horse...

27:08.918 --> 27:11.588
I do have a horse thing,
so please send those along.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.009
Hey.

27:16.968 --> 27:20.055
-The darnedest thing just happened.
-Barry, we talked about darnedest.

27:20.138 --> 27:25.226
Yeah. Erin called me
and they suddenly want my sperm again.

27:26.061 --> 27:27.103
Huh.

27:27.187 --> 27:29.439
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

27:29.522 --> 27:30.523
Nope.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.319
Thank you.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.405
You're welcome.

27:43.495 --> 27:44.537
I love you.

27:46.998 --> 27:48.416
Yeah, you're all right.

27:58.635 --> 27:59.469
[grunts]

28:08.228 --> 28:09.479
Oh.

28:14.109 --> 28:17.320
Oh, we're drinking in the morning.
We must be celebrating something.

28:17.404 --> 28:19.572
We are going to the Maldives.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.491
-Yes! Hey!
-Yes.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.077
To dynamic solutions!

28:24.160 --> 28:26.037
Do you want to see the video?

28:26.121 --> 28:29.040
The language is extremely vague.

28:29.582 --> 28:32.544
I say synergy not once, but twice.

28:32.627 --> 28:36.089
-Stop. Save some for later.
-Come here.

28:37.215 --> 28:39.259
Good thing I'm not wearing a sarong.

28:40.343 --> 28:42.220
<i>Hello. I'm Grace Hanson.</i>

28:42.303 --> 28:43.596
<i>And I'm Frankie Bergstein.</i>

28:43.680 --> 28:46.266
<i>-And we're Vybrant.</i>
<i>-And we're Vybrant.</i>

28:46.349 --> 28:51.312
<i>And we'd like to apologize</i>
<i>for the previous video that was released.</i>

28:51.396 --> 28:56.443
<i>We both realized it was a mistake</i>
<i>the second we sent it out,</i>

28:56.526 --> 28:57.819
<i>and we are sorry.</i>

28:57.902 --> 29:00.405
Oh, my God. Frankie recut the video.

29:00.488 --> 29:04.826
<i>We made a big promise</i>
<i>to send free vibrators and donuts</i>

29:04.909 --> 29:07.328
<i>to 50,000 ladies.</i>

29:07.704 --> 29:09.330
<i>Isn't that right, Grace?</i>

29:09.414 --> 29:10.749
<i>That's right-- Frankie!</i>

29:10.832 --> 29:11.750
Oh.

29:11.833 --> 29:15.837
<i>And don't we owe it</i>
<i>to each and every one of these people</i>

29:15.920 --> 29:17.756
<i>to fulfill our promise?</i>

29:17.839 --> 29:19.174
<i>That's right-- Frankie!</i>

29:19.257 --> 29:21.593
<i>And Grace, one more question.</i>

29:21.676 --> 29:26.431
<i>Don't we sometimes sneak</i>
<i>into each other's bedrooms at night</i>

29:26.514 --> 29:28.641
<i>to kiss each other on the mouth?</i>

29:28.725 --> 29:30.059
<i>That's right-- Frankie!</i>

29:32.061 --> 29:33.521
[Grace] I don't believe it.

29:33.605 --> 29:34.606
Really?

29:35.064 --> 29:38.526
Because I'm new to this whole relationship
and I'd have put money on it.

29:38.610 --> 29:41.029
I can't believe she did this.

29:41.696 --> 29:44.949
It's fine, we can go to the Maldives
when we're dead.

29:45.533 --> 29:47.035
I'll call my travel guy.

29:47.619 --> 29:48.620
Nick.

29:51.247 --> 29:53.041
How soon can we leave for the Maldives?

29:53.124 --> 29:56.211
I could have the plane gassed up
by the time we get to the airport.

29:58.213 --> 30:00.924
I wanna go now. Right now.

30:01.841 --> 30:03.092
Are you sure?

30:04.135 --> 30:05.345
Yeah.

30:08.681 --> 30:09.682
