05:29.120 --> 05:30.163
And why is that?

05:31.414 --> 05:34.751
Well, he's a lot smarter than I am,

05:35.252 --> 05:37.838
and I'm not a very good writer.
I could screw him up.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.048
Well, I beg to differ with you, Andrew.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.591

-Really.

Well, if you enjoy something
and you're good at it,

06:07.784 --> 06:10.370

as what you want to be.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.249
Ricky Brown makes fun of him
every day.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.294
Today he was squirting him
with a water pistol,

so that everyone makes fun of him?

13:37.900 --> 13:40.903

wrong with him in the first place.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.483
What? No. A car?

14:18.566 --> 14:20.735
Yeah. There was a contest in the paper.

Your life isn't miserable enough as it is?

26:19.078 --> 26:22.081
So now you're going to get up in front
of the whole student body and sing?

26:22.372 --> 26:23.582
I love to sing.

26:23.665 --> 26:27.461
I've known you my whole life.
Never heard you sing. Not once.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.463
Since when do you love to sing?

26:29.588 --> 26:31.298
Ever since I can remember.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.800
Look, maybe...

26:33.425 --> 26:35.094
I don't know. Maybe Norman's right.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.888
I have a right to sing in the talent show,
just like anybody else.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.681
Don't you ever watch cop shows?

26:40.057 --> 26:41.475
You have the right to remain silent?

26:41.934 --> 26:43.811
You want to sing? Do it in the shower!

26:44.103 --> 26:46.730
Why don't you sing with a band?
Why do you have to sing all by yourself?

26:46.855 --> 26:49.107
I sing a cappella.
My voice is my instrument.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.859
Oh, my God!

26:51.110 --> 26:54.321
Why not just buy a gun and
let Ricky Brown shoot you in the eye?

26:54.446 --> 26:55.656
I knew
you wouldn't understand, Norman.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.032
That's why I didn't tell you about it.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.117
What about us?

26:58.617 --> 26:59.952
You sing in that stupid show,

27:00.077 --> 27:01.745
and it's just gonna make it worse
for the rest of us!

27:02.287 --> 27:05.916
It doesn't matter what they do to us.
You said it yourself, Norman.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.876
They'll probably just do it anyway.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.713
I think you should sing if you want to.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.805
I'm sorry, Norman, but I'm going to sing.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.139
Damn it, Stanley!

27:21.140 --> 27:23.142
Why do you have to make
everything harder than it is?

27:23.183 --> 27:24.935
- You shouldn't swear, Norman.
-Go to hell!

27:25.561 --> 27:26.812
You deserve whatever you get!

27:33.026 --> 27:34.903
I think he's just worried about you.

27:36.155 --> 27:39.158
Come on, there's a few more minutes
before the bell rings.

27:45.789 --> 27:48.333
Hey, Andy. Mary Clear likes you.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.338
Mary Clear likes me?

27:53.797 --> 27:54.965
That's what I said.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.176
- Why?
-"Why"?

27:58.177 --> 28:01.805
I don't know. She's pretty much
gone steady with everybody else, so...

28:02.181 --> 28:05.851
She told you that she wanted
to go steady with me?

28:05.976 --> 28:07.436
Of course! She's my best friend.

28:08.187 --> 28:11.064
She said she thinks you're cute.
And don't ask me why.

28:13.150 --> 28:14.193
Wow.

28:17.571 --> 28:21.950
ANDY: <i>Let's just say that
selection by process of elimination</i>

28:22.034 --> 28:25.537
<i>lacked a certain romance one might
otherwise have found exciting.</i>

28:26.371 --> 28:28.207
<i>Even at the age of 13.</i>

28:31.084 --> 28:33.211
<i>At the end of every month,
I had to collect money</i>

28:33.212 --> 28:35.339
<i>from all the customers on my route.</i>

28:35.839 --> 28:38.091
<i>It was a task I relished for its simplicity</i>

28:38.217 --> 28:41.094
<i>in what was becoming
an increasingly complicated world.</i>

28:41.595 --> 28:44.348
<i>Hit the porch
and the customer was satisfied.</i>

28:45.098 --> 28:47.225
<i>And a satisfied customer meant payoffs,</i>

28:47.226 --> 28:50.979
<i>ranging anywhere from cash tips
to assorted snack foods.</i>

28:55.400 --> 28:57.819
<i>Next stop, Mary Clear's house.</i>

28:58.237 --> 29:00.822
<i>Regardless of her sudden
and mysterious interest in me,</i>

29:01.240 --> 29:04.034
<i>coupled by the fact
that I had yet to hit her porch,</i>

29:04.868 --> 29:06.828
<i>I wasn't expecting much.</i>

29:11.250 --> 29:13.043
Hi, Andy. How's it going?

29:13.877 --> 29:15.671
Good. How's it going with you?

29:15.796 --> 29:16.838
Great.

29:17.422 --> 29:18.465
Good.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.636
So, uh, how's it going?

29:24.221 --> 29:25.681
You asked me that already.

29:26.598 --> 29:27.641
Oh, uh... Yeah.

29:29.017 --> 29:30.435
You said "great", right?

29:30.519 --> 29:31.687
Yeah.

29:31.812 --> 29:36.274
Okay. So, is your mom or dad home?
I'm collecting for the paper.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.276
Oh, yeah. Here you go.

29:39.403 --> 29:42.906
Oh, okay, thanks.

29:46.535 --> 29:48.245
- There you go.
-Thanks.

29:49.246 --> 29:52.249
All right, well, I gotta get going.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.333
Yeah, I'll see you at school.

29:54.668 --> 29:56.712
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.131
I'll... I'll see you.

30:56.897 --> 30:58.565
Hey, Nichol.
I see you're collecting for the paper.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.567
Why'd you have to do that, Ricky?

31:01.360 --> 31:02.778
I didn't have to.

31:02.903 --> 31:04.363
It was my treat. What's in the bag?

31:06.365 --> 31:09.326
Don't get up. I'll just have to
knock you back down again.

31:13.955 --> 31:14.998
Chocolate chip.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.918
My favourite. See you in school, Nichol.

31:22.214 --> 31:24.007
DAN: So, she paid you the money?

31:25.384 --> 31:29.387
Yeah. Which means Mary had to ask
her parents for the money in advance.

31:29.388 --> 31:30.389
It was a set-up.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.432
Barbara Foss wasn't blowing smoke.

31:33.809 --> 31:34.851
Mary likes me.

31:35.352 --> 31:36.395
And this is a bad thing?

31:37.145 --> 31:39.356
I don't know. It's weird.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.650
I'm no different than I was
at the beginning of the year.

31:41.858 --> 31:44.611
And I just...
I mean, I've never even talked to her.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.240
What does that have to do
with anything?

31:48.365 --> 31:50.617
I don't know. ltjust seems like it should.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.414
You gonna kiss her?

31:57.416 --> 31:59.251
Yeah. Of course I'm gonna kiss her.

31:59.376 --> 32:02.212
- Idiot.
-You know, she's a real good kisser.

32:02.838 --> 32:03.880
How would you know?

32:04.005 --> 32:06.675
You're probably the only other guy
in the school that hasn't kissed her yet.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.802
Yeah, right,
like she made out with Big G.

32:08.885 --> 32:09.970
I doubt it.

32:10.554 --> 32:11.805
He's probably up before you are.

32:12.556 --> 32:13.974
Shut up, Andy.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.393
You and Big G
are real bosom buddies now, huh?

32:16.601 --> 32:17.644
You shut up.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.105
I bet you never kissed a girl
in your life, have you, Nichol?

32:21.189 --> 32:23.442
Hey, Freel's back from suspension.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.444
(ALL CHATTERING)

32:32.492 --> 32:33.577
Hey, Nichol.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.621
How's that paper coming
in Simon's class?

32:37.914 --> 32:38.999
Okay.

32:40.041 --> 32:42.085
Remember you told me
Mr Simon was your favourite teacher?

32:42.586 --> 32:44.337
- Yeah.
-Still think so?

32:44.463 --> 32:45.672
After he stuck you with Big G?

32:46.465 --> 32:48.508
I don't know. I guess so.

32:48.884 --> 32:50.051
I don't get you, Andy.

32:50.135 --> 32:51.720
You know,
my dad says Simon's a homo.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.472
<i>ANDY". I had no idea what Modak meant,</i>

32:54.473 --> 32:56.850
<i>but I sensed from his tone
that this homo thing</i>

32:56.933 --> 33:00.312
<i>was not something Mr Simon
should include on his resume.</i>

33:00.437 --> 33:01.480
Tell me something I don't know.

33:02.481 --> 33:03.690
So, you're saying you like homos?

33:04.232 --> 33:05.275
Yeah, right.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.320
Take it easy, Andy.

33:19.498 --> 33:23.084
ANDY: <i>Another thing you never do
is believe</i> a <i>guy like Bruce Modak.</i>

33:23.168 --> 33:25.545
<i>I decided to investigate
the allegation myself.</i>

33:25.670 --> 33:27.339
- Hey, Dire?
-Yeah?

33:27.464 --> 33:30.050
You knew Mr Simon was a homo, right?

33:30.133 --> 33:31.510
Where you been, Nichol?

33:33.512 --> 33:34.513
Jimmy, Jimmy!

33:35.472 --> 33:37.515
I hear Simon's a homo?

33:37.516 --> 33:39.059
Nichol, seriously?

33:39.142 --> 33:40.977
What's it like to go around
with your head up your butt?

33:43.146 --> 33:44.522
Good afternoon, everyone!

33:44.523 --> 33:46.525
Good afternoon, Mr Simon.

33:46.566 --> 33:47.651
I have an announcement to make.

33:48.485 --> 33:50.695
The car I won in the newspaper contest
has arrived,

33:50.779 --> 33:54.199
and I've asked Principal Kelner
if I could give each of you a ride,

33:54.699 --> 33:56.993
and she said, "Yes."

33:57.369 --> 33:58.703
(ALL WHOOPING)

33:59.579 --> 34:01.498
"A world I dream where black or white,

34:01.540 --> 34:02.541
"Whatever race you be,

34:02.666 --> 34:05.377
"Will share the bounties of the earth
And every man is free,

34:05.877 --> 34:08.964
"Where wretchedness will hang its head
And joy, like a pearl,

34:09.089 --> 34:11.549
"Attends the needs of all mankind

34:11.550 --> 34:12.551
"Of such a world, I dream."

34:13.510 --> 34:16.596
So, the poem's about
not being prejudiced?

34:17.304 --> 34:19.431
Well, Mr Simon says
we can pick only one word,

34:19.558 --> 34:21.309
and it has to mean the same thing
to the both of us.

34:21.393 --> 34:24.020
What's wrong with "prejudice"?
The poem's about being prejudiced.

34:24.145 --> 34:27.148
Yeah, but prejudice can mean
different things to different people.

34:28.817 --> 34:30.318
- No, it can't.
-Sure it can.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.195
It would change depending on
if you were...

34:33.572 --> 34:36.699
No one's prejudiced against you,
so it's different for you than others.

34:37.576 --> 34:41.329
So, you're saying I'd have to be
a negro to understand it?

34:41.413 --> 34:44.248
No. People are prejudiced
for all kinds of reasons.

34:45.250 --> 34:46.918
Negroes just happen to be
one of the majors.

34:48.210 --> 34:50.589
Okay, so you got a better word?

34:51.172 --> 34:52.591
How about "tolerance"?

34:54.592 --> 34:55.594
"Tolerance"?

34:56.594 --> 34:58.138
Okay. Now why does that work?

34:59.472 --> 35:00.557
Ilookeditup.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.185
"Sympathy or indulgence

35:04.269 --> 35:07.606
"for beliefs or practices differing from
or conflicting with one's own,

35:08.064 --> 35:10.609
"or the act of allowing
something to be different."

35:12.360 --> 35:13.445
So,

35:14.487 --> 35:16.990
the guy in the poem dreams of a world

35:17.073 --> 35:18.950
where people let each other
be different?

35:19.451 --> 35:21.620
Yeah. That's why "tolerance"
is such a great word.

35:21.828 --> 35:24.623
It's not even saying
you have to like the other person.

35:25.415 --> 35:28.043
It's just saying, leave them alone.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.507
Okay, so now we write
a short story about being tolerant?

35:35.050 --> 35:36.092
Yeah.

35:37.427 --> 35:39.846
<i>(IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU PLAYING)</i>

35:49.481 --> 35:51.441

# <i>Here we go again
It's always me, me, me, me, me</i> #

35:55.654 --> 35:56.655
- Can I ask you a question?
-I told you

35:56.738 --> 35:59.032
never to come in my room again,
you little freak!

35:59.866 --> 36:00.950
No,no,no!

36:01.660 --> 36:03.244
No, no, no, no! lforgot! I swear!

36:03.328 --> 36:04.371
I swear, I forgot.

36:04.704 --> 36:05.955
I just want to ask you a question!

36:06.164 --> 36:07.374
I'll clean your room for a week!

36:10.085 --> 36:11.127
What?

36:12.045 --> 36:13.838
Could a teacher get fired
if he's a homo?

36:14.714 --> 36:15.840
Definitely.

36:15.924 --> 36:17.092
Now get out!

36:19.761 --> 36:20.887
One more question.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.347
One more week, freak.

36:24.391 --> 36:25.475
Okay.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.144
What exactly is a homo?

36:38.947 --> 36:40.907
The whole house
smells like a glue factory.

36:41.324 --> 36:43.576
You're using too much glue again,
aren't you?

36:43.702 --> 36:45.537
Well, I want it to stick.

36:45.870 --> 36:48.873
It will stick with less glue.
Come here, I'll do it. You watch.

36:49.499 --> 36:50.542
Come on, move over.

36:51.501 --> 36:52.585
I almost had it, Dad.

36:52.711 --> 36:53.711
No, you did not.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.296
You did not have it.
Just watch and learn.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.215
- Where are the directions? Right here?
-Yeah.

36:57.340 --> 36:58.383
Have you read these?

36:58.508 --> 37:00.635
Beginning to end, before you started?

37:00.719 --> 37:01.720
Yeah.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.723
See now, look at that.
You were using too much glue.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.101
The directions say you can take off
extra glue with a razor blade.

37:08.893 --> 37:10.895
Or you could just do it right
the first time,

37:10.979 --> 37:12.397
then you don't have that trouble.

37:12.522 --> 37:15.024
Come on, pal, you'll end up
cutting your finger off.

37:15.150 --> 37:17.402
- That'd be bad, right?
-Yeah.

37:19.028 --> 37:21.114
- Look. You got a mess here.
-I...

37:23.450 --> 37:25.410
I have some homework to finish.

37:26.035 --> 37:29.205
If you have homework to finish,
you shouldn't even be doing this.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.957
You know better.

37:44.596 --> 37:47.390
<i>NARRATQR'. (ON TV) The holiday

<i>...suicide attack into the grounds

37:58.777 --> 38:01.571
Mom, did kids go steady
when you were in eighth grade?

38:03.782 --> 38:06.785
Yeah, Andy. Even in the old days.

38:08.161 --> 38:09.662
What was it like?

38:10.789 --> 38:13.208
It's pretty much always been the same.

38:14.167 --> 38:17.796
I think the only things that really change
are the clothes and the music.

38:24.385 --> 38:25.428
Why?

38:26.971 --> 38:28.890
Are you thinking about going steady?

38:29.015 --> 38:31.434
No! No. Just...

38:31.810 --> 38:34.813
You know, wondering,
if it ever comes up.

38:36.815 --> 38:40.860
So was it fun,
or did it make you nervous?

38:41.820 --> 38:43.822
I seem to remember it
as being pretty fun.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.990
I mean, and a little nerve-racking.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.745
It doesn't last long, though.
At least not in eighth grade.

38:51.454 --> 38:53.289
Yeah. I've noticed that.

38:54.874 --> 38:57.418
All right, well, I'm gonna go see

- Why? Do I smell?
-Oh, no, no, I just...

I mean, you never know
when it's going to start.

39:11.850 --> 39:14.352

to start at the wrong time, right?

39:15.478 --> 39:16.855
Yeah, sure, Mom.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.233
One more question.

39:21.860 --> 39:24.487
What's a... A homo?

39:28.950 --> 39:30.868
The other kids know about this?

39:30.869 --> 39:32.036
Yeah. They do.

39:34.664 --> 39:36.082
I was afraid to talk about it at first.

39:37.959 --> 39:40.378
But then I heard
other kids talking about it,

39:40.503 --> 39:42.380
and I thought I better say something.

39:48.511 --> 39:50.138
You did right telling me this.

Hey,

40:05.904 --> 40:08.823
-you didn't tell him, did you?
-Of course.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.909
Did you want him to find out
in school from the other kids?

40:11.326 --> 40:13.286
Yeah, yeah. That's how
everyone else finds out about it.

40:13.369 --> 40:14.579
Why should our kid be any different?

40:14.704 --> 40:16.915
Well, he asked me.
What was I supposed to do?

40:17.624 --> 40:19.834
You could tell him
he's not old enough to know.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.545
The kids at school are talking about it.

40:25.924 --> 40:26.925
Hey!

40:27.592 --> 40:28.926

40:28.927 --> 40:31.929
No! You know
how kids start these rumours.

Well, do we know if it's not true?

40:33.932 --> 40:36.517
I don't know that we want
someone like that teaching our kid!

40:43.816 --> 40:46.361
Oh, stop it! You don't know how
someone becomes something like that.

41:08.591 --> 41:09.634
Have you thought about that?

41:10.635 --> 41:13.221
They look up to him
because he's a wonderful teacher,

41:14.013 --> 41:16.391
not because of what he does
in his bedroom at night.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.060
Why do you even got to talk like that?

41:19.185 --> 41:20.978

Fine, fine. Okay, it's absurd.

I hope you have some proof.

44:17.530 --> 44:19.615
doesn't mean that
he's not some kind of pervert.

so much as a hint of an impropriety.

You know how children are.

48:33.160 --> 48:35.412
Apparently there's a rumour

48:35.413 --> 48:37.415
that's going around the school
that you're

48:41.127 --> 48:42.420

48:56.934 --> 48:58.352
A homosexual?

48:58.727 --> 48:59.770
Yes.

49:00.521 --> 49:04.442
This whole misunderstanding stems
from the Karen Connor incident.

49:05.734 --> 49:08.362

Mr Freel insists
unless something is done,

49:20.791 --> 49:23.419
he is going to tell the other parents
and the papers.

49:28.466 --> 49:30.426
According to him, this is a fact.

49:30.468 --> 49:32.469

for young Jason.

49:48.486 --> 49:50.488
well, that's good enough for me.

49:54.241 --> 49:57.786
And when you do deny it,
if that's not enough for him,

49:57.912 --> 50:00.498
then I will stand right
beside you and fight.

50:02.708 --> 50:05.503
They... They see a man like you,

50:06.420 --> 50:07.922

50:08.005 --> 50:10.007

and they blow it up for no reason.

50:20.518 --> 50:21.727

50:23.646 --> 50:27.524
I guess I just don't know
how my private life has any bearing

50:27.525 --> 50:29.735
on my ability as a teacher.

50:32.363 --> 50:35.032
Shouldn't the work just stand for itself?

50:35.533 --> 50:37.201
Yes, of course.

50:39.286 --> 50:41.455
But this isn't about that.

and we could move forward.

51:07.439 --> 51:09.692

that you're a homosexual?

51:12.528 --> 51:15.197

You and Mary Clear.

Ricky Brown's looking for you, man.
He's pissed. He still likes her.

Then why did he break up with her?

53:22.700 --> 53:25.703
You didn't know?
She actually broke up with him!

he broke up with her.</i>

the kind of man that Stephen Simon is.

I have never, ever worked
with a better person

54:42.780 --> 54:45.657
or a better teacher in my entire career.

54:45.741 --> 54:46.825
Did he deny it?

54:48.160 --> 54:49.536
Well, he felt...

54:49.912 --> 54:51.788
And, actually, I support him on this.

54:51.789 --> 54:53.749
He couldn't understand

54:53.791 --> 54:56.084
why his record as a teacher
wouldn't stand on its own.

54:56.168 --> 54:58.795
That sounds like a fancy way
of saying he didn't deny it.

54:58.796 --> 55:00.672
What did you expect him to do?
Admit it?

55:00.756 --> 55:04.551
This isn't about his teaching ability.
We'll give him that.

55:05.093 --> 55:06.720
It's about kids looking up to him

55:06.804 --> 55:09.807
like he's some kind of example
on how to live.

55:10.307 --> 55:13.685
We have a moral obligation.
It's in the Bible.

55:13.769 --> 55:15.812
Did you know he was taking kids
for rides in his car?

55:15.813 --> 55:18.190
I gave him permission.

55:18.315 --> 55:21.818
He had won a new car.
He was just treating the children.

55:21.819 --> 55:24.947
I guess we'll know who to point
the finger at on that one, now won't we?

55:25.072 --> 55:26.698
Now, you listen to me.

55:28.158 --> 55:31.828
Your son brutally whipped
a defenseless young girl

55:31.829 --> 55:34.331
because he thought that she was ugly!

55:34.414 --> 55:37.000
He thought by touching her,
it would rub off on him.

55:37.125 --> 55:38.585
And now you're afraid
he might look up to

55:38.710 --> 55:41.547

like Stephen Simon?

55:43.131 --> 55:45.759
I'm not saying what my boy
did to that girl was right.

55:45.843 --> 55:47.845
I whipped his ass real good
for what he did.

55:47.928 --> 55:52.224
But that's all he is. He is just a boy.
He doesn't know any better.

accomplished coming here.

of this community a great disservice.

You know he's a homo.

No. I don't know
if he's homosexual or not.

56:13.579 --> 56:15.956
And frankly, I don't care.

56:16.039 --> 56:17.875
My guess is this community will care,

56:17.916 --> 56:20.252
and they won't appreciate
you condoning it.

56:23.255 --> 56:25.215
I'll see myself out.

56:25.340 --> 56:27.175
Thank you, Mrs Freel.

56:37.895 --> 56:41.023
What if they don't let Mr Simon
teach any more?

56:42.900 --> 56:45.485
I certainly hope that doesn't happen.

56:45.611 --> 56:48.071

get all wound up over this,

See, they had this thing in the old days
called the Salem witch hunt,

57:00.918 --> 57:04.004
where people got all wound up
before they knew what the facts were.

57:04.671 --> 57:07.674

He got so wound up, he's still spinning.

Can I help you, Mr Nichol?

01:32:33.048 --> 01:32:34.090
I'm so sorry, sir.

01:32:34.174 --> 01:32:36.301
It's okay. I'm glad you dropped by.

01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:38.720
Would you like a cup of tea?

01:32:39.012 --> 01:32:40.138
No, sir, thank you.

01:32:40.889 --> 01:32:42.891
I just wanted to ask you a question.

01:32:42.974 --> 01:32:44.601
My wife, yes.

01:32:47.062 --> 01:32:48.563
Mystery solved?

01:32:49.105 --> 01:32:50.565
No, sir.

01:32:52.025 --> 01:32:53.151
Well...

01:32:53.485 --> 01:32:55.069
Yeah. I guess that, too.

01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:56.529
Have a seat.

01:32:59.699 --> 01:33:01.618
So, where is she?

01:33:02.077 --> 01:33:06.289
She passed away,
19 years ago today, in fact.

01:33:09.334 --> 01:33:10.543
I'm sorry.

01:33:10.627 --> 01:33:13.088
Yeah. A little sappy, I'm afraid.

01:33:13.505 --> 01:33:16.800
As a writer, it would do you well
to avoid melodrama in your work.

01:33:18.968 --> 01:33:22.013
I suppose I loved her too much.

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:27.143
Does that help you, Andrew?

01:33:27.227 --> 01:33:28.353
No.

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:32.524
I mean, I don't care about that.
That's not why I came.

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:35.109
Oh, really?

01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:37.821
Well, you've got me intrigued.
What is it?

01:33:39.364 --> 01:33:43.409
I just wanted to know, when you
assigned me to work with Stanley,

01:33:43.535 --> 01:33:44.619
Why'd you pick me?

01:33:44.744 --> 01:33:47.122
You said there was a reason.

01:33:47.163 --> 01:33:53.128
Well, I believe that life is about timing,
opportunity, and choices.

01:33:54.045 --> 01:33:56.131
It was an opportunity at the right time

01:33:56.172 --> 01:34:00.009
for a wonderful young man like you
to make the right choice.

01:34:00.093 --> 01:34:04.681
And I knew you weren't ready to do that,

01:34:04.806 --> 01:34:07.183
but I didn't want you to miss it.

01:34:08.393 --> 01:34:12.689
But how did you know it would work?
How did you know that I could do it?

01:34:13.481 --> 01:34:14.899
I didn't.

01:34:15.233 --> 01:34:19.779
But sometimes you just need someone
to tell you that you can.

01:34:21.447 --> 01:34:24.159
ANDY: <i>I'm not sure
that I fully understood it then,</i>

01:34:24.242 --> 01:34:26.035
<i>but it did occur to me that somewhere</i>

01:34:26.119 --> 01:34:30.206
<i>in that marvellous pile of books
Mr Simon cherished,</i>

01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:33.793
<i>there was</i> a <i>manual
called How</i> to <i>Be</i> a <i>Teacher</i>

01:34:33.877 --> 01:34:35.670
<i>written by Mr Simon.</i>

01:35:01.487 --> 01:35:04.199
Andy! Andy! Shut it off! Come on!

01:35:05.033 --> 01:35:07.160
Shut it Off! Shut it Off!

01:35:07.952 --> 01:35:09.204
Come on.

01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:11.205
Now, how many times have I told you?

01:35:11.206 --> 01:35:13.416
You have to use the wheel grooves
as a guide

01:35:13.499 --> 01:35:15.752
to show where you left off!
Here. I'll show you!

01:35:15.877 --> 01:35:17.670
No, no! No.

01:35:19.214 --> 01:35:21.216
What do you mean, "No"?

01:35:24.219 --> 01:35:25.553
I mean...

01:35:25.678 --> 01:35:27.680
I'm going to finish the lawn, Dad.

01:35:27.764 --> 01:35:31.059
I'll go over it again
and catch anything I missed.

01:35:31.142 --> 01:35:32.226
That's just the way I do it.

01:35:32.227 --> 01:35:35.104
Once one way,
and then another against the grain.

01:35:35.188 --> 01:35:38.316
Like at the ballpark,
or like a checkerboard!

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:43.154
I like to do it, Dad.
I like to mow the lawn.

01:35:43.238 --> 01:35:47.242
I like the way it looks and smells,
and I'm going to finish it.

01:35:47.283 --> 01:35:48.493
My Way!

01:35:48.576 --> 01:35:52.497
Then, once I'm done, if I've still left
a spot, you can call me a jughead.

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:55.250
But please, just let me finish.

01:36:00.338 --> 01:36:01.547
Okay.

01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:07.136
Fair enough.

01:36:08.221 --> 01:36:09.264
What?

01:36:19.107 --> 01:36:21.359

01:37:09.198 --> 01:37:11.534
