01:41.040 --> 01:42.963
- Hello.
- Hey, Yuri.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.128
Good to see you, Will.

01:45.280 --> 01:46.406
Charlie.

01:47.840 --> 01:51.003
- What do you say, Will?
- Slow night, huh?

01:52.240 --> 01:55.130
Got kinda busy
about 10 minutes ago.

01:55.280 --> 01:59.080
These winter colds are just the worst.

01:59.240 --> 02:01.766
You know, if my shift
moves any slower,

02:01.920 --> 02:04.002
I think I will be
going backwards.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.210
- Time to play, you ready?
- Ah, I'm kinda busy right now.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.170
You want some pie?

02:14.360 --> 02:16.886
- Oh, pie.
- Pie.

02:17.040 --> 02:19.850
No, I just want some coffee.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.401
Coffee.
You got it.

02:23.920 --> 02:25.046
How long that pot
been sitting out there?

02:25.200 --> 02:28.761
I just made it... fresh pot...
right before it got busy, Will.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.442
- Hey, Will.
- Aaron.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.082
Want some more coffee?

02:42.200 --> 02:45.204
You haven't even put any coffee
in my cup yet, Charlie.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.203
- Damn.

02:50.360 --> 02:53.523
God damn it, Aaron.

03:15.480 --> 03:18.404
Um, how are you progressing
with that coffee?

03:20.560 --> 03:22.847
Sorry, I'm...

03:23.000 --> 03:25.651
I'm not real with it today,
you know what I mean?

03:28.360 --> 03:30.203
You want cream and sugar?

03:30.360 --> 03:32.044
Cream.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.407
- Cream.
- Do you want cream and sugar

03:34.560 --> 03:36.961
with the coffee?

03:50.160 --> 03:52.162
I'll take it as it is.

03:56.640 --> 03:59.450
Whose move is it?

03:59.600 --> 04:01.602
Hmm, Charlie?

04:33.800 --> 04:35.450
Charlie? Charlie?

04:35.600 --> 04:37.602
Charlie?

04:41.680 --> 04:43.364
Whose move is it?

04:45.240 --> 04:48.483
Your move.
It's your move, Will.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.123
That's right.
Next Tuesday evening.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.726
Mm-hmm.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.845
How you doing?

05:19.360 --> 05:21.727
I've been down to the diner,
it's a mess.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.241
Look, is this necessary?

05:24.400 --> 05:26.120
- I already gave a statement.
- I understand

05:26.200 --> 05:28.407
you've been having
a tough time lately.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.123
You could say that.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.203
I've been working
for extra jobs

05:35.360 --> 05:37.362
just to try to keep
my head above water.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.562
You like Charlie?

05:39.720 --> 05:41.609
Everybody likes Charlie.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.683
Anything you don't like about him?

05:43.840 --> 05:46.650
Anything unusual?

05:46.800 --> 05:48.529
- Like what?
- I don't know.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.444
Kind of thing maybe

05:50.600 --> 05:52.887
you wouldn't expect
at an all-night diner.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.003
You know who owns the place.

05:55.160 --> 05:56.685
Yeah, I do.

05:56.840 --> 05:59.127
Tell me who was there that night.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.842
Just take your time.
Think a minute.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.167
I... I don't know.

06:06.320 --> 06:09.449
What do you mean you don't know?
You spent enough time there.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.284
Who was there that night?

06:13.880 --> 06:15.564
Just customers.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.326
I'm gonna need you to tell me
how it all went down.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.488
I need $2. That's it.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.563
I don't need
an extra day off or anything.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.530
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.330
- What the hell is this?
- I would've thought that was

06:33.480 --> 06:34.891
fucking obvious, mate.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.321
Okay, everybody in the corner.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.005
Move. Move!

06:40.480 --> 06:43.563
On your feet!
I'm not gonna say it again.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.563
Get in the corner!
Move!

06:45.720 --> 06:48.246
Come on, love.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.402
Now!

06:50.560 --> 06:52.210
Let's go, on your feet.
Let's go!

06:52.360 --> 06:53.486
On your way.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.889
Right, if you're smart,
you're scared.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.371
If you're not, you should be.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.881
I don't want any heroes
and I don't want any grief.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.363
You do what I say,
when I say it,

07:05.520 --> 07:08.046
and everybody will be able
to walk out of here.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.369
- You got that, geezer?
- Yeah.

07:12.520 --> 07:15.922
Exactly as I say or I blow you
against that fucking wall.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.451
Right?

07:18.520 --> 07:21.524
Now if you'd be so kind
just to step out from behind there.

07:25.520 --> 07:28.603
Let's go.
Eh... hey.

07:30.320 --> 07:32.368
- My hip.
- 911 emergency.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.851
What's the nature of your call?

07:34.000 --> 07:37.083
All right, son, on your feet.
Let's go, move!

07:44.560 --> 07:45.600
- Hey, cheeky.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.324
- No.
- Let's go.

07:47.480 --> 07:48.925
Come on.
There's a good girl.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.640
Crawling under there
isn't gonna help you.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.649
Doing what you're told might.

07:57.880 --> 08:01.202
There, it's all right.
You'll be fine.

08:01.360 --> 08:04.125
Right, mobiles, watches,
and wallets

08:04.280 --> 08:07.887
into the bag provided by
my associate here.

08:08.040 --> 08:11.408
Now, I know you're all scared
and that's a good thing.

08:11.560 --> 08:14.882
If you're scared, you're a lot less
likely to do something stupid.

08:15.040 --> 08:17.407
Because if you're thinking of
doing something stupid,

08:17.600 --> 08:19.409
I guarantee you will regret it,

08:19.600 --> 08:22.570
but only for about the half second
it'll take me to turn,

08:22.720 --> 08:26.088
aim in your general direction,
and pull the trigger.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.481
I have no more desire
to be here than you do.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.211
So if everybody does what I say,

08:31.400 --> 08:33.971
when I say it,
things will go a lot smoother.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.765
- I didn't think you'd come.
- Me, either.

08:53.920 --> 08:56.366
I promise everything's
gonna be different now.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.568
We're gonna pick up Bonnie,
is that okay?

09:05.720 --> 09:07.722
Yeah.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.800
- It's just...
- I know what you're thinking.

09:12.960 --> 09:15.281
I couldn't get it done before

09:15.440 --> 09:18.364
and how am I gonna be able
to get it done now, is that right?

09:18.520 --> 09:20.363
Are you gonna take
responsibility, you know?

09:20.520 --> 09:23.569
Are you gonna be there
when we need you?

09:23.720 --> 09:26.564
I made mistakes

09:26.720 --> 09:29.007
and I paid for them.

09:32.600 --> 09:35.285
But I know

09:35.440 --> 09:37.442
what's important now.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.282
You don't have to worry.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.602
I promise

09:44.760 --> 09:47.161
I won't ever break into
another car again.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.523
I have an ultrasound appointment
today if you wanna come.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.286
You kidding me?
Try and stop me.

10:03.360 --> 10:05.010
Oh, shit.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.442
I'm supposed to meet Patrick's friend
for this job interview.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.881
That's all right.
If you can't make it, you can't make it.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.651
- It's not a big deal.
- No, screw it. I can reschedule.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.808
- I'm coming with you.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.450
Are you fucking blind?

10:19.600 --> 10:21.523
Watch where you're going,
you stupid cow.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.609
Not you, Bill, another cow.

10:23.760 --> 10:24.841
Wait, what are you doing?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.162
You just got out
five minutes ago, please.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.209
It's not worth it.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.488
I'm sorry.

10:31.640 --> 10:33.688
Hello!

10:33.840 --> 10:36.525
Jesus, Bonnie,
what are you trying to do to me?

10:36.680 --> 10:38.444
I'm sorry!
I'm just so excited!

10:38.600 --> 10:40.560
How does it feel to be out
in the big, wide world?

10:40.600 --> 10:42.921
- It almost feels safer on the inside.
- Yeah, right.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.441
I hear those communal showers
are really tough

10:45.600 --> 10:47.204
- on the good-looking boys.
- Okay.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.089
- Really?
- Come on.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.891
What's the deal here? You living in
a hotel? What are you, big time now?

10:52.040 --> 10:55.362
My apartment is flooded,
so I'm staying here till they fix it.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.763
- So what's next?
- Dropping you off at the next corner.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.609
Oi, what'd I tell ya?

11:10.720 --> 11:12.609
Nigel, keep a lookout for us.

11:12.760 --> 11:15.730
Now, who's in charge here?

11:17.640 --> 11:21.008
Eh? Who runs this place?

11:21.200 --> 11:24.886
I do, I do.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.367
Oh, you are a proper geezer.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.729
There's a safe in the back.
Take me to it.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.803
Register's open, a lot of cash.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.241
Why don't you just take it,
get the hell outta here, huh?

11:37.040 --> 11:40.601
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Either you can walk me to that safe

11:40.800 --> 11:43.326
or I can blow your legs off
at the knees

11:43.480 --> 11:45.403
and you can crawl there.

11:52.480 --> 11:54.323
The safe is back in the office.

11:54.520 --> 11:56.488
After you.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.809
- Go on!
- Yup.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.531
It's all yours, Bill.

12:20.160 --> 12:23.209
- There it is.
- Open it.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.963
Today, you mug.

12:42.640 --> 12:44.369
Back away.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.130
That, you cheeky bastard,

12:56.280 --> 12:57.930
is not the safe I'm looking for.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.321
Where's the cash safe?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.448
I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.840
If at some point I've given you
the impression that I don't know

13:07.920 --> 13:09.763
exactly what's going on
around here,

13:09.920 --> 13:13.322
or that I'm some thick cunt
you mess about, I apologize.

13:13.520 --> 13:16.842
Now, where's the safe?
The real one.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.368
The one that says you get
to keep your good fucking leg.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.009
Open it.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.968
- Can't do it.
- Excuse me?

13:44.120 --> 13:46.566
I can't open it.
It's on a time lock.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.849
I can't open it until midnight.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.728
That's God's truth.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.885
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck!

13:59.040 --> 14:01.042
Fuck!

14:13.000 --> 14:14.411
Keep an eye on 'em.

14:16.880 --> 14:19.565
What's going on?
It was meant to be a quick in and out.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.165
Safe's on a time lock.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.322
Fuck off.
Are you sure?

14:23.480 --> 14:25.881
Well, it says time lock
on the door, so, yeah.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.883
I'm pretty fucking sure.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.769
- What time's it set for?
- Midnight.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.001
Midnight.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.685
I suppose that's why
he told you to pull this

14:32.840 --> 14:34.410
at two minutes before
fucking midnight.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.844
It's 30 minutes away.
What do you want to do?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.924
- We're gonna sit tight. Wait it out.
- You're joking.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.242
I'm not leaving
without emptying that safe.

14:43.440 --> 14:44.726
And what happens
if someone comes in?

14:44.880 --> 14:46.166
- Like who?
- Like customers.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.408
We keep the doors locked,
put the closed sign up.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.608
It's not exactly
brain surgery, is it?

14:50.760 --> 14:52.569
This is not what we planned.

14:54.120 --> 14:57.363
If you've got a problem, Bill,
trot on. I'll have your share.

15:04.920 --> 15:07.571
30 minutes.
Okay.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.444
And then we're out.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.685
It's okay.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.769
- We've got trouble.
- What now?

15:30.920 --> 15:32.331
- Cops.
- How many?

15:32.480 --> 15:34.847
Who gives a fuck?
A fucking cop, we gotta go.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.571
- There's only one.
- What's he doing?

15:37.720 --> 15:40.963
Singing fucking show tunes. He's a cop.
We gotta get outta here now.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.281
He's standing outside
his cruiser smoking a fag.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.603
Cops come in here all the time.
It's a diner.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.131
Right.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.011
Then let's give him
the warm and friendly fucking

15:52.160 --> 15:53.889
"Be Brite" experience then,
shall we?

15:54.040 --> 15:55.963
It's business as usual.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.327
You and you
back behind the counter.

15:58.480 --> 15:59.891
- What?
- Chef and your mates,

16:00.040 --> 16:01.485
back in the kitchen.
Let's go.

16:01.640 --> 16:04.325
And to all you nice people,
back to your dinner.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.568
Back to chitchat,
back to coffee,

16:06.720 --> 16:08.400
whatever it is that
you'd normally be doing

16:08.480 --> 16:10.403
if I wasn't here
fucking up your day.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.403
On your feet,
back to your tables.

16:12.560 --> 16:15.006
I can't do this.

16:15.200 --> 16:18.249
Hey, look at me.
Yes, you can.

16:20.160 --> 16:21.889
Let's go! Come on!

16:22.080 --> 16:23.241
- Come on!

16:25.800 --> 16:28.531
Bill, I'm gonna need you
in the kitchen

16:28.680 --> 16:30.967
in case the chef decides
to get knife-happy.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.565
- Where are you gonna be?
- Behind the counter

16:32.760 --> 16:35.684
- in case the old boy gets lively.
- Okay.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.004
Oh, Christ.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.650
Eh, Bonnie, is it?

16:44.800 --> 16:47.610
Darling, if you're crying

16:47.760 --> 16:51.003
when someone comes in here,
they're gonna think something's wrong.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.280
Now, you wouldn't want someone
to get hurt, would you?

16:53.320 --> 16:57.006
- No.
- Big smiles all around, then, eh?

16:57.200 --> 16:58.326
- Yeah?
- Okay.

16:58.480 --> 17:01.927
Yeah. I want him out of here
as soon as possible, understood?

17:02.120 --> 17:03.610
Yea... yeah.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.728
Where you want me, boss?

17:05.920 --> 17:08.241
- Take one of the back tables.
- Right.

17:22.920 --> 17:24.922
No fuckin' about.

17:26.839 --> 17:29.047
Here, here.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.521
It's all right.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.448
- Hello.
- Hey, Yuri.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.244
Good to see you, Will.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.050
What do you say, Will?

18:07.440 --> 18:09.124
Slow night, huh?

18:09.280 --> 18:11.965
Got kinda busy
about 10 minutes ago.

18:12.120 --> 18:14.043
It's time to play, you ready?

18:14.200 --> 18:16.248
I'm kinda busy right now.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.643
You want piece of pie?

18:21.800 --> 18:24.690
- Oh, pie.
- Pie.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.763
No, I just want some coffee.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.046
You got it.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.043
How long that pot
been sitting out there?

18:30.200 --> 18:33.488
I just made it... fresh pot...
right before it got busy, Will.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.848
More coffee?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.446
You haven't even put
any coffee in my cup yet, Charlie.

18:46.840 --> 18:48.729
- Damn.
- Shit.

18:48.880 --> 18:52.407
God damn it, Aaron.

19:04.840 --> 19:07.001
I'm not real with it today,

19:07.160 --> 19:09.208
you know what I mean?

19:09.360 --> 19:11.124
You want cream and sugar?

19:11.280 --> 19:13.328
Cream.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.564
I'll take it as it is.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.490
So whose move is it?

19:24.080 --> 19:26.208
Hmm, Charlie?
Charlie?

19:26.360 --> 19:28.124
Charlie?

19:28.280 --> 19:30.282
Whose move is it?

19:35.160 --> 19:36.685
Your move.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.722
It's your move, Will.

19:49.280 --> 19:51.726
You know what,
I gotta take a leak.

19:51.880 --> 19:54.201
Why don't you top this off again

19:54.360 --> 19:55.964
and I'll be right back
and we'll get into the game.

19:56.120 --> 19:57.610
Sure.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.290
Take your time.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.724
- Yeah.
- I came in like we planned,

20:19.880 --> 20:21.291
but something's not right out here.

20:21.440 --> 20:23.966
I think this... this Brit,
he showed up early.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.764
What are you talking about?

20:25.920 --> 20:28.207
You told me there
was gonna be one guy.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.681
Now, Charlie is giving me
signals out here

20:30.840 --> 20:32.251
like there's
a whole crew out here.

20:32.400 --> 20:35.324
Fuck, I told him to go in alone.

20:35.480 --> 20:38.245
What do you mean
they're giving signals?

20:38.400 --> 20:39.447
Are they in there or aren't they?

20:39.600 --> 20:41.967
They're hiding from me. They're acting
like this is business as usual.

20:42.120 --> 20:45.488
This is not what we discussed.

20:45.680 --> 20:48.081
They were supposed to
come in, sit tight

20:48.240 --> 20:51.050
until this played out so Yuri wouldn't
suspect that we were involved.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.089
Now I got fuck knows
how many guys out here with guns

20:53.240 --> 20:55.049
and they're thinking
that I'm the bad guy.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.646
Did you even tell the Brit
that I was gonna be in here?

21:04.560 --> 21:06.403
Step out, step out of the stall.

21:06.560 --> 21:07.800
Step out of the stall
with your hands up.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.644
What's going on? Will?

21:12.400 --> 21:14.050
Step out.
Get the fuck out!

21:14.200 --> 21:16.248
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.767
Somebody's robbing this place.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.450
No, shit.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.969
Step forward.

21:24.120 --> 21:26.122
Up against the wall.

21:27.680 --> 21:30.729
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm just a customer, man.

21:33.440 --> 21:34.805
I was in here when it started.

21:40.280 --> 21:41.566
You call 9-1-1?

21:41.720 --> 21:43.449
Yeah, of course.

21:51.320 --> 21:52.810
Did you hear that?

21:52.960 --> 21:55.440
No, there's a customer
that was in the stall hiding.

21:57.120 --> 21:59.964
He called 9-1-1.
His name is Nick.

22:00.120 --> 22:03.488
- Davenport.
- Nick Davenport.

22:04.680 --> 22:07.047
Did he hear everything
you just said?

22:08.400 --> 22:10.050
Yeah.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.400
- I'll get back to you.

22:15.360 --> 22:16.646
Attention, all units.
2-11 in progress...

22:16.800 --> 22:18.370
- Shit.
- At the Be Brite Diner.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.005
1542 Main Street.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.083
All units report
to location immediately.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.402
Code three.
Repeat, attention, all units.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.927
2-11 in progress
at the Be Brite Diner.

22:28.440 --> 22:30.442
Turn around.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.450
So what are you
really doing here?

22:33.600 --> 22:35.489
What the fuck
are you really doing here?

22:35.640 --> 22:37.481
I told you, man.
I just came in to take a piss.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.488
Don't lie to me.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.722
All hell broke loose.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.127
I called the cops,
for Christ's sake.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.369
Till I figure out
what the fuck's going on,

22:52.520 --> 22:53.806
this is going with me.

22:53.960 --> 22:57.282
I want you to stay right here.

22:57.480 --> 22:58.891
All right, kid?

23:07.520 --> 23:09.090
Friend of yours?

23:13.560 --> 23:15.289
What happened
after the cop got killed?

23:15.440 --> 23:18.284
That's when things
really started to get bad.

23:24.720 --> 23:27.007
- What the fuck's going on?
- Cop was onto us.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.810
Found him in the toilet
with this one.

23:29.880 --> 23:31.769
- So you just shot him?
- Yes, Billy.

23:31.920 --> 23:33.365
That's where all the blood
came from.

23:33.520 --> 23:34.851
- Mate...
- What do you care?

23:35.000 --> 23:37.207
I don't give a fuck,
but I've got a funny feeling

23:37.360 --> 23:39.522
that every other cop
in a 10-mile radius might.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.444
Look, I've told you once already,

23:41.600 --> 23:44.171
you want out,
there's the fucking door.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.363
Maybe, if we're lucky,

23:51.520 --> 23:53.727
he didn't make the call
before you got into him.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.370
That's the spirit.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.682
Now give our new friend here
the once-over.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.842
I don't want any more surprises.

24:01.520 --> 24:05.002
No, no.
No, no.

24:05.160 --> 24:07.481
- Cell phone.
- I don't have one.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.282
That's nice.

24:20.400 --> 24:22.562
Almost time.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.609
On your feet.

24:24.760 --> 24:26.728
- I said on your feet!

24:28.080 --> 24:30.651
Bollocks.
You, help him up.

24:30.800 --> 24:33.007
Help him up.

24:34.480 --> 24:36.801
- Charlie, come on.

24:36.960 --> 24:38.962
Come on.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.090
Off you go, then.

24:43.360 --> 24:44.850
Give me the bag.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.082
Keep an eye on 'em.

24:53.240 --> 24:55.242
Come on.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.842
For your face.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.889
You, that's far enough.

25:22.080 --> 25:24.082
Let's go.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.768
It's 12:00.
Open it.

26:19.480 --> 26:22.484
Back up! Get the fuck back!
Back in the fucking corner!

26:32.000 --> 26:33.445
What the fuck's going on
back there?!

26:35.760 --> 26:37.524
Looks like
a fucking road accident.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.523
Cloud...

26:43.480 --> 26:45.130
silver lining.

26:50.160 --> 26:52.288
- Glad you came?
- Ask me that

26:52.440 --> 26:55.364
if we get out of here
in one piece.

26:55.520 --> 26:57.522
Off you go, then.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.722
- Say aluminum.
- I don't want to.

27:09.880 --> 27:12.611
Come on, but it sounds so sexy.

27:16.800 --> 27:20.088
- Aluminum.

27:21.800 --> 27:25.566
Now say herb.

27:28.240 --> 27:31.210
Herb.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.882
I love the way you talk.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.690
Really?

27:36.880 --> 27:38.291
- What about the way I...

27:38.440 --> 27:40.886
Don't move! Drop it!

27:41.040 --> 27:42.849
Don't try it, asshole.

27:45.440 --> 27:47.249
Sit down.

27:49.360 --> 27:51.124
Get outta here.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.648
Sorry, love.

28:00.840 --> 28:02.681
You don't pay your girlfriend
to clean up here?

28:02.760 --> 28:05.161
What do you want?

28:05.320 --> 28:07.721
- I need one more favor.
- We had a deal.

28:07.880 --> 28:10.042
You said the last time
we were done.

28:10.200 --> 28:13.044
You're gonna be interested
in this one.

28:13.200 --> 28:15.043
Don't look so fucking upset,
it's easy.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.965
I just need you to get me
a hard drive with some names on it.

28:18.120 --> 28:19.963
Names?

28:20.120 --> 28:22.851
- What names?
- Yours amongst others.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.843
Mine?

28:33.640 --> 28:35.404
Yours, too, I wager.

28:35.560 --> 28:39.406
It's the big box of secrets
to keep everyone in line

28:39.560 --> 28:42.643
and it belongs
to an associate of ours.

28:42.800 --> 28:44.404
Yuri Mikhalev.

28:44.560 --> 28:46.767
He may look like
a sweet old man,

28:46.920 --> 28:49.571
but he runs organized crime
in Connecticut.

28:49.720 --> 28:52.564
Behind all the rackets,
all the big jobs,

28:52.720 --> 28:55.564
Mikhalev moving chess pieces.

28:55.720 --> 28:58.007
That drive's his
get-out-of-jail-free card.

28:58.160 --> 29:01.130
I wouldn't want it falling
into the wrong hands,

29:01.280 --> 29:03.487
and that's exactly
what's gonna happen

29:03.640 --> 29:05.085
in the next 48 hours

29:05.240 --> 29:07.720
if the FBI raids his safe.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.609
We've got a police informant

29:09.760 --> 29:12.001
inside of Yuri's organization.

29:12.160 --> 29:15.004
The FBI are gonna hit us.

29:15.160 --> 29:17.686
It's on for the 12th,
you got that?

29:17.840 --> 29:21.128
I don't understand
why he's not moving the drive

29:21.320 --> 29:22.924
and I can't ask him
about the message

29:23.080 --> 29:24.969
because I'm not supposed
to know about it.

29:25.120 --> 29:27.851
I think Yuri's selling us out
to the Feds.

29:30.760 --> 29:33.491
- Is there any money in it?
- You're gonna be robbing a joint.

29:33.640 --> 29:37.361
You get me what I need
and everything else you find is yours.

29:42.160 --> 29:44.766
- I'm gonna need my crew.
- No, no crew.

29:44.920 --> 29:47.287
Is that understood?

29:48.320 --> 29:50.368
You go in alone

29:50.520 --> 29:53.091
two minutes before midnight.

29:53.240 --> 29:54.651
Not a moment sooner.

29:54.800 --> 29:57.007
Billy, it's me.
I need you to give Nigel a bell.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.889
Tell him we've got a job
for tonight.

30:00.600 --> 30:02.682
Don't trouble your little mind
with questions, Bill.

30:02.840 --> 30:05.161
Just call Nigel
and tell him to be ready.

30:05.360 --> 30:07.488
- Oi, are you fucking blind?

30:07.640 --> 30:09.529
Watch where you're going,
you stupid cow!

30:09.680 --> 30:12.445
Not you, Bill, another cow.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.284
I'll explain everything later.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.849
Why aren't we wearing masks?

30:23.000 --> 30:24.960
How many more times
do I have to fucking tell you?

30:25.040 --> 30:26.041
It's a quick in and out.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.806
This time tomorrow night we'll be
sipping cocktails in Costa Rica.

30:28.960 --> 30:31.964
Why are we sitting out here at 11:30
if we're not going in till midnight?

30:32.120 --> 30:34.805
Well, you'll be thrilled by a change
of plans then, won't you?

30:34.960 --> 30:36.928
- What?
- We're going in early.

30:37.080 --> 30:39.560
- Why?
- Because our generous employer

30:39.720 --> 30:41.961
has told me, as so long
as he gets what he needs,

30:42.120 --> 30:44.646
we can help ourselves
to all the afters.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.320
And seeing as though
I'm not doing this

30:46.440 --> 30:48.488
out of the kindness
of me fucking heart,

30:48.640 --> 30:51.689
we're going in early
and we're doing watches and wallets.

30:51.840 --> 30:54.241
Watches and wallets.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.209
You have seen the shithole
we are gonna rob, right?

30:56.360 --> 30:58.328
- Yeah, what's your point?
- My point, Derrick,

30:58.480 --> 31:00.084
is it's highly unlikely to be filled

31:00.240 --> 31:02.641
with Rolexes
and fucking Louis Vuittons.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.723
Who's Louis Vuitton?
A footballer?

31:04.920 --> 31:07.605
Nigel, do us all a favor
and shut up.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.848
Right.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.843
Hey, what's going on?

31:13.960 --> 31:15.962
I'm tired of being in his pocket.

31:17.360 --> 31:19.362
We get what he wants
outta that safe,

31:19.560 --> 31:21.608
I say there's a deal to be made.

31:21.760 --> 31:23.922
You wanna screw the boss over?

31:25.440 --> 31:27.204
Don't fuck the plan
in the 11th hour, mate.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.129
Don't worry about it, Billy.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.527
He doesn't even know you're here.

31:50.720 --> 31:52.722
Nothing personal, mate.

32:02.480 --> 32:05.006
The whole fucking force
just showed up.

32:17.280 --> 32:19.282
- It's on.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.889
You, Bonnie!

32:27.040 --> 32:29.930
- Come over here.
- No.

32:31.160 --> 32:32.525
Answer it.

32:38.880 --> 32:40.723
Hello?

32:43.520 --> 32:44.851
It's the police.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.404
Talk to them.

32:49.560 --> 32:52.086
Bonnie Potroski.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.570
I'm a waitress here.

32:58.120 --> 32:59.929
He wants to know
if everyone's okay.

33:00.120 --> 33:02.043
Yes, everything is fine.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.969
Yeah, everyone's okay.

33:06.120 --> 33:08.043
He wants to know
how many people are here.

33:13.120 --> 33:15.361
- That's enough for now.

33:15.520 --> 33:18.000
Back to where you were.
Go on!

33:45.240 --> 33:47.846
I want the public at least
three blocks back from here.

33:48.040 --> 33:49.451
Nobody gets in unless I clear it.

33:49.600 --> 33:51.120
Looks like more rain's
on the way, sir.

33:51.240 --> 33:52.730
Oh, perfect.

33:55.880 --> 33:57.962
Good of you to join us.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.248
- What's the situation?
- Perimeter's secure.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.767
Snipers in position front and rear.
They got nowhere to go.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.763
- Any visibility?
- No, sir.

34:04.920 --> 34:06.809
Blinds are down
on all the windows.

34:06.960 --> 34:09.007
So we have no idea
what's going on in there.

34:09.159 --> 34:11.040
- Numbers?
- Well, we're a little light

34:11.159 --> 34:13.400
on details,
but it's a late-night diner,

34:13.560 --> 34:15.527
so at the very least
we got the staff in there.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.887
I spoke to Bonnie Potroski,
a waitress.

34:18.040 --> 34:20.281
She was very scared.
Someone was telling her what to say.

34:20.440 --> 34:22.408
- Which was?
- She said everything was fine,

34:22.560 --> 34:24.449
but we had reports of gunfire.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.601
It could be really
fucking messy in there.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.001
- How many gunmen?
- We think at least two.

34:29.159 --> 34:31.128
On top of that,
we got one of our own in there.

34:31.280 --> 34:33.521
This squad car was issued
to Will Tompkins.

34:33.679 --> 34:37.286
And I know him.
20-year vet, good cop.

34:37.440 --> 34:40.967
- You made any contact?
- No, but we got a suspect.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.248
A Nicolas Davenport.

34:43.400 --> 34:46.244
We ran his name. He just spent
three months in County.

34:46.400 --> 34:49.085
- You think he's involved?

34:49.239 --> 34:50.810
Maybe even running the show.

34:50.960 --> 34:53.167
- Who's your informant?
- Stay on the phone.

34:53.360 --> 34:55.362
One second, I gotta take this.

34:56.639 --> 34:57.926
Anything else I should know?

34:58.080 --> 35:01.687
We ran the plates
on the Cutlass. It's stolen.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.968
All right, I make every call
from here on.

35:04.160 --> 35:05.730
- That clear?
- What's your plan?

35:09.120 --> 35:10.849
Get them talking.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.963
The negotiator's about to start in.

35:13.120 --> 35:15.691
Uh-huh.
Any idea on the suspect?

35:15.880 --> 35:18.042
There's a Nick Davenport.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.409
Just got out of county. Registered
address two blocks from the diner.

35:21.560 --> 35:24.530
- 2240 Lincoln.
- He got any family there?

35:24.720 --> 35:27.530
Yeah, his wife.
Amanda Davenport.

35:27.680 --> 35:30.490
All right, well, keep me appraised.
I want this shit cleaned up.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.565
It's okay, baby.

35:52.960 --> 35:55.281
Here you go.
Direct line's right here, sir.

36:27.200 --> 36:30.409
Just like last time.
Find out what he wants.

36:34.160 --> 36:37.004
- Hello?
- With whom am I speaking?

36:37.160 --> 36:39.481
- This is Bonnie.
- Bonnie, this is Jeff Porter.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.130
I work with the police department.

36:41.280 --> 36:43.521
This phone is a direct line to me now
whenever you pick it up.

36:43.720 --> 36:46.246
I need to talk to
whoever's in charge in there.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.687
He wants to talk
to whoever's in charge.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.965
He says he doesn't wanna talk.

36:53.120 --> 36:56.249
Tell him I can't give him what
he wants unless he gets on the phone.

36:56.440 --> 36:58.727
He can't get you what you want
unless you talk to him.

37:05.480 --> 37:07.721
- I'm listening.
- My name is Jeff Porter.

37:07.880 --> 37:10.167
- What's your name?
- Look, the only thing

37:10.320 --> 37:14.245
you need to understand is that
unless I get your full cooperation,

37:14.400 --> 37:16.448
I'm going to redecorate the insides

37:16.600 --> 37:19.683
of the Be Brite Diner
with pints of blood.

37:23.960 --> 37:27.009
You have my full cooperation.
I wanna give you what you want

37:27.160 --> 37:29.003
so nobody gets hurt, okay?

37:29.160 --> 37:31.640
I wanna make that really clear.
I'm gonna try and help you out.

37:31.800 --> 37:33.768
That's very fucking kind of you, mate.

37:33.920 --> 37:37.527
I'm overwhelmed by
your compassion for my situation.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.125
We have reports of gunfire.

37:39.280 --> 37:41.203
Is there anybody in there
that's injured?

37:43.840 --> 37:46.207
Look, if somebody's hurt,
let them come out,

37:46.360 --> 37:48.203
then we can do business.

37:48.360 --> 37:51.081
There are a lot of cops out here
who like to do this a different way,

37:51.160 --> 37:53.128
so let's help each other out.

37:53.280 --> 37:56.090
I'll tell you what,
as a sign of how reasonable

37:56.240 --> 37:59.210
I'm prepared to be,
we'll let one out.

38:01.240 --> 38:02.685
Thank you, appreciate that.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.770
I'll send in two paramedics
with a stretcher. Is that okay?

38:05.920 --> 38:07.410
Uh-uh, scratch that.

38:07.560 --> 38:10.211
We'll take her out to you.

38:21.120 --> 38:22.560
They're sending out
an injured party.

38:22.680 --> 38:24.648
I want a wide area
around that door.

38:24.800 --> 38:27.007
Back an ambulance up
about 20 feet away.

38:27.200 --> 38:29.328
Not too close.
I don't wanna make them nervous.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.403
Getting somebody out alive
will give us a better idea

38:31.560 --> 38:33.403
of what we're dealing with.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.482
Let's get you geared up.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.130
Why you tell them
we're gonna send one out?

38:39.280 --> 38:41.203
'Cause we are.

38:43.880 --> 38:46.326
- Which one?
- Her.

38:46.480 --> 38:48.448
She'll do nicely.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.641
I'm not walking her out.

38:55.360 --> 38:57.408
I will.

38:58.480 --> 39:00.244
I'll do it.

39:00.440 --> 39:04.331
Oh, yeah.
You missed my announcement.

39:04.480 --> 39:06.881
I don't want any heroes,

39:07.040 --> 39:11.250
but volunteers are welcome.

39:12.680 --> 39:15.126
You take her out,
you don't say shit,

39:15.280 --> 39:19.285
and if you're not back in 30 seconds,
it's bye-bye, Bonnie.

39:21.120 --> 39:25.364
- Are we crystal?
- Clear.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.011
Pick her up.

39:46.600 --> 39:48.329
I'll be back.

39:50.640 --> 39:52.324
All personnel, stand down.

39:52.480 --> 39:54.881
Civilians exiting the building.
Stand down.

39:55.080 --> 39:57.082
Maintain 20-foot radius.

40:02.280 --> 40:03.725
It's over there.

40:04.920 --> 40:06.285
Are you okay?

40:09.560 --> 40:11.722
Talk to me.

40:11.880 --> 40:13.640
You need to tell me
what's going on in there.

40:13.760 --> 40:15.410
Is she all right?

40:18.040 --> 40:19.610
Is anybody else in there hurt?

40:25.640 --> 40:27.642
Is that your blood?

40:27.800 --> 40:31.122
Talk to me, I'm right here.
I can give you what you need.

40:44.680 --> 40:47.206
I can't talk to you.

40:53.120 --> 40:55.566
She was going into cardiac shock.

40:55.760 --> 40:58.286
That was Nick Davenport
and he's covered in blood.

40:58.440 --> 41:00.761
- We gotta go in there.
- No, no. They sent someone out.

41:00.920 --> 41:02.481
That's a start.
We need to keep talking.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.005
I gotta remind you
there's a cop in there?

41:04.160 --> 41:05.571
Do I have to remind you
who's in charge?

41:05.720 --> 41:08.610
- Tompkins is my main priority.
- This is my operation, Barnes.

41:08.760 --> 41:11.366
Trust me, we're a long way
from moving in.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.484
Now tell me more about Davenport.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.563
- I think he's one of them.
- Based on what?

41:17.720 --> 41:20.405
What makes you think
he didn't volunteer to bring her out?

41:20.560 --> 41:22.483
If you think that he was such a hero,
why did he go back in?

41:22.640 --> 41:25.484
As far as I'm concerned,
he's a major fucking suspect.

41:31.200 --> 41:33.726
There are an unknown
number of hostages being held,

41:33.880 --> 41:36.167
but it is believed that
there is at least one

41:36.320 --> 41:38.163
police officer among them.

41:38.320 --> 41:40.800
- Sources inform us...
- Oh, my God.

41:40.960 --> 41:43.040
...negotiators are on the scene
and are attempting...

41:43.160 --> 41:45.447
Nick was just there
to talk to Patrick.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.443
- ...again, very sketchy information...

41:53.800 --> 41:55.450
Hi. Mrs. Davenport?

41:55.600 --> 41:57.887
Is this about Nick?

41:58.040 --> 42:00.960
Yeah, I'm afraid it is. I'm gonna have
to ask you to come with me, please.

42:06.040 --> 42:08.008
You might wanna get a jacket.

42:19.560 --> 42:21.608
You, come over here.

42:24.600 --> 42:27.570
Answer it.
Tell them you've got demands

42:27.720 --> 42:30.610
and if they don't cooperate,
the cop will be the first to die.

42:30.760 --> 42:33.684
- No.
- Come again?

42:33.840 --> 42:35.729
I won't do it.

42:35.880 --> 42:38.565
- Really?

42:47.720 --> 42:50.564
- Hello?
- Yeah, who is this?

42:50.720 --> 42:52.961
I've got demands.

42:53.120 --> 42:55.521
Specific demands.

42:55.680 --> 42:57.728
What now?

43:02.360 --> 43:04.362
- Hello, hello?

43:04.560 --> 43:06.528
Now we wait.

43:24.160 --> 43:26.731
- What is this place?
- Just come on.

43:35.800 --> 43:37.802
Come on.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.570
This is Jeff Porter.

43:49.720 --> 43:52.041
We wanna help you
with those demands,

43:52.200 --> 43:54.168
- but we need some way to communicate.
- Well, that didn't take long.

43:54.360 --> 43:57.603
You go out there and you tell them
we need a SUV to take us to the airport.

43:57.760 --> 44:00.604
Once we get the SUV,
he gets four hostages.

44:00.760 --> 44:03.001
Tell him we need a jet and a crew

44:03.200 --> 44:05.601
waiting on the runway
fueled up and ready to go.

44:05.760 --> 44:08.684
And once we get on board,
he gets three more hostages.

44:08.840 --> 44:11.525
- Got that?
- Yeah.

44:11.680 --> 44:13.762
Good.
On your way, then.

44:18.440 --> 44:22.126
Oi, same rules as before.

44:25.800 --> 44:27.484
Got it.

44:51.160 --> 44:53.401
- I'm unarmed.
- So am I.

44:53.560 --> 44:56.086
SUV and a fucking plane?

44:56.240 --> 44:58.561
- Are you out of your mind?
- It'll buy us time.

44:58.720 --> 45:00.768
For what?

45:00.920 --> 45:03.730
- Plan B.
- Which is?

45:03.880 --> 45:06.770
Soon to be revealed, mate.

45:07.800 --> 45:10.804
Let's just let him
keep them preoccupied, shall we?

45:22.520 --> 45:24.807
- What's your name?
- Nick.

45:24.960 --> 45:26.803
So how'd you get involved
in this, Nick?

45:26.960 --> 45:29.088
I'm not involved.

45:29.240 --> 45:31.129
I just met
my brother here for coffee.

45:31.280 --> 45:32.930
You can ask him.

45:33.120 --> 45:35.361
Is everyone in there okay?

45:35.520 --> 45:37.966
No, they're not okay.

45:39.080 --> 45:40.684
Do I look like I'm okay?

45:42.840 --> 45:45.366
They want a SUV
to take them to the airport.

45:45.520 --> 45:48.251
When they get the SUV,
you get four hostages.

45:48.400 --> 45:50.687
And they want a jet
waiting for them on the runway.

45:50.840 --> 45:54.731
When they get on the jet,
you get three more.

45:54.880 --> 45:57.724
- The rest go with them.
- I'll see what I can do.

45:59.920 --> 46:01.922
Make sure that SUV
gets here quick.

46:02.080 --> 46:04.845
Hey.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.002
So we can talk.

46:13.600 --> 46:15.284
What did you say to him?

46:15.440 --> 46:17.283
Exactly what you told me to.

46:17.440 --> 46:19.807
You wouldn't be fucking me about,
would you, boy?

46:20.000 --> 46:22.128
- No.
- Good.

46:25.080 --> 46:26.844
Oi, Bill.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.843
I'm having a piss.

46:30.760 --> 46:33.127
We got plainclothes
going to Davenport's house.

46:33.280 --> 46:34.884
Pick up his wife.

46:35.040 --> 46:38.601
And this is interesting,
the guy's brother is Patrick Davenport.

46:38.760 --> 46:41.684
- Who is Patrick Davenport?
- Internal Affairs.

46:41.840 --> 46:44.161
You're kidding.
Get him down here now.

46:44.360 --> 46:46.442
He's already on his way.

46:51.880 --> 46:54.042
- Yes?
- Sorry to bother you,

46:54.200 --> 46:56.726
I'm Detective O'Reilly.
This is Detective Creedy.

46:56.880 --> 46:58.689
- How can I help you?
- We need to talk

46:58.840 --> 47:01.127
- to Mrs. Amanda Davenport.
- She's not here.

47:01.280 --> 47:03.760
- Your guy already came and got her.
- What?

47:03.960 --> 47:06.008
- Porter.
- O'Reilly here.

47:06.160 --> 47:07.446
We're at Davenport's house.

47:07.600 --> 47:10.888
Her mother says some cops
picked her up about 15 minutes ago.

47:11.040 --> 47:14.044
- They identify themselves?
- We checked with dispatch.

47:14.200 --> 47:16.328
Whoever did this,
they weren't cops.

47:19.040 --> 47:20.804
What's going on?

47:20.960 --> 47:24.601
A couple of guys pretending to be cops
picked up Davenport's wife.

47:29.920 --> 47:31.922
I gotta take this.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.570
Hey, you got an update for me?

47:42.720 --> 47:44.688
A couple of detectives
went to Davenport's house

47:44.880 --> 47:47.770
to bring in his wife,
but she was picked up already.

47:47.920 --> 47:49.922
- I don't know by who.
- I've got her.

47:50.080 --> 47:52.128
You just worry about
wrapping things up on your end.

47:52.280 --> 47:54.009
Am I clear?

48:01.040 --> 48:03.088
Why aren't we at a police station?

48:15.760 --> 48:17.762
How long you've been married?

48:21.680 --> 48:23.250
How long?

48:26.560 --> 48:28.881
Almost two years.

48:29.040 --> 48:30.644
Why don't you tell me
about the men

48:30.840 --> 48:32.604
that your husband's
working with?

48:32.800 --> 48:34.529
What men?

48:34.720 --> 48:36.484
He's not working with anybody.

48:39.200 --> 48:41.282
Thanks.

48:50.280 --> 48:51.884
Want some water?

48:57.040 --> 48:58.883
I get dehydrated,

48:59.080 --> 49:01.003
so I like a lot of water.

49:10.920 --> 49:12.922
Copy that.

49:22.160 --> 49:25.004
- Lieutenant Davenport.
- What's the situation?

49:25.160 --> 49:28.926
Well, your brother's
up to his balls

49:29.080 --> 49:32.163
- in an armed robbery.
- At his usual haunt

49:32.360 --> 49:34.408
that just happens to be
owned by Yuri Mikhalev?

49:34.560 --> 49:35.960
Come on, Barnes.
He'd never do that.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.889
I was just here with him
45 minutes ago.

49:38.040 --> 49:40.407
Whatever's going down here,
he's got nothing to do with it.

49:48.200 --> 49:49.850
What are you doing
still coming to this place?

49:50.000 --> 49:52.048
You know you can't hang out
in a diner

49:52.200 --> 49:53.850
owned by someone
like Yuri Mikhalev.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.082
I like it.
I know everybody.

49:59.040 --> 50:01.691
- You lost weight.
- No club sandwiches on the inside.

50:01.840 --> 50:03.649
Yeah, it's not supposed
to be easy.

50:06.840 --> 50:09.161
Look, Nick,

50:10.400 --> 50:11.970
you made me look bad today.

50:12.120 --> 50:15.283
I know.
I'm sorry.

50:15.440 --> 50:16.851
How do you just not show up
for a job interview?

50:17.000 --> 50:19.128
Amanda agreed to meet me.

50:19.280 --> 50:20.930
What, so you just blow it off?

50:21.120 --> 50:23.088
She's my wife, Patrick.

50:23.240 --> 50:25.083
I'm doing everything I can
to make it all work out.

50:25.240 --> 50:27.720
I get that,
but you don't let him know,

50:27.920 --> 50:29.365
you don't call me,
that's not the way to start.

50:29.520 --> 50:31.090
- I've got myself a gig lined up.
- With who?

50:31.240 --> 50:32.890
- Some people that I met.
- Some people you met.

50:33.040 --> 50:36.487
- Some people you met in prison, Nick.

50:36.640 --> 50:39.211
I told you.
It's a legit gig, Pat.

50:45.400 --> 50:48.051
- Jesus, Pat.
- Take it.

50:55.040 --> 50:56.769
Thanks.

51:00.160 --> 51:01.889
I gotta go.

51:04.200 --> 51:07.329
- Everything's gonna work out, okay?
- Yeah.

51:28.760 --> 51:30.728
Well, all I know is
there's a diner being robbed

51:30.880 --> 51:31.961
and your brother's
in the thick of it.

51:32.120 --> 51:34.566
Of course you wouldn't understand,
because there's real police work.

51:34.720 --> 51:36.210
As opposed to what I do?

51:36.400 --> 51:38.120
You've ruined the livelihood
of good cops...

51:38.160 --> 51:40.686
- men with wives, their families.
- If they're good cops,

51:40.840 --> 51:42.120
they got nothing to worry about.

51:42.280 --> 51:44.362
And you should stay focused
for half a minute

51:44.520 --> 51:46.727
on getting my brother and the rest
of the hostages outta there.

51:46.880 --> 51:50.327
The negotiator Jeff Porter,
he wants to speak with you.

52:13.240 --> 52:16.244
Thank you so much
for coming back.

52:20.400 --> 52:22.687
I wasn't gonna leave you
here alone.

52:22.840 --> 52:25.764
Yeah, but you could've surrendered
out there and you would've been safe.

52:27.280 --> 52:30.489
I figured that if Amanda
was in this situation...

52:35.320 --> 52:38.210
that I'd hope somebody
would come back and look after her.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.604
It's gonna be okay.

52:45.480 --> 52:50.008
Excuse me,
I really have to use the restroom.

52:53.200 --> 52:55.202
It's a bit messy in there, love.

52:57.280 --> 53:00.409
You don't let people use the restroom,
it's gonna get a bit messy in here.

53:04.360 --> 53:06.169
Nigel, take her.

53:09.200 --> 53:10.645
Not without me.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.204
I beg your pardon?

53:15.360 --> 53:17.886
I don't want her
going anywhere alone with him.

53:19.560 --> 53:22.803
Who, Nigel? That's a bit
fucking offensive, isn't it?

53:25.520 --> 53:28.251
He's a nice bloke.

53:28.400 --> 53:30.641
- Aren't you, Nigel?
- Yeah.

53:30.800 --> 53:34.122
Now sit down and shut up.

53:44.560 --> 53:46.369
That's a good boy.

54:02.360 --> 54:04.362
You all right?
What is it? What happened?

54:04.520 --> 54:07.285
There's a dead body in there.

54:18.080 --> 54:20.447
You know, Nick was just there
meeting up with his brother.

54:32.280 --> 54:34.044
You wanna call him?

54:36.040 --> 54:37.451
Yeah.

54:48.800 --> 54:51.724
- Whose phone is that?

54:53.600 --> 54:55.204
It's Charlie's private line

54:55.360 --> 54:56.850
in his office.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.002
On your feet now!

55:00.000 --> 55:02.002
Come on!

55:09.440 --> 55:11.329
- Oh, my God.
- Come on.

55:11.480 --> 55:13.801
Answer the phone.

55:13.960 --> 55:15.644
Answer it!

55:15.800 --> 55:17.131
Oh, my God.

55:18.120 --> 55:20.168
- Come on.
- Hello?

55:20.320 --> 55:22.368
Bonnie, it's Amanda. You okay?

55:22.520 --> 55:25.171
No, they're right here
in front of me.

55:25.320 --> 55:29.211
- Will they let me talk to him?
- It's for Nick, it's his wife.

55:29.360 --> 55:32.887
Now why would the kid's wife
have the private line?

55:33.040 --> 55:35.441
The cops put her up to it,
didn't they?

55:35.640 --> 55:38.610
- Because?
- Because they think he's the mastermind

55:38.760 --> 55:41.161
behind this whole fucking thing.
Now get him in here.

55:41.320 --> 55:44.005
- Go on.
- That's not true.

55:44.160 --> 55:47.687
- Nick would never...
- Shh.

55:47.840 --> 55:50.730
Hmm, Bonnie, Bonnie.

55:53.480 --> 55:57.485
You are a proper sort,
aren't you?

56:00.280 --> 56:02.521
You've been very helpful.

56:06.280 --> 56:08.282
Perhaps another time.

56:09.600 --> 56:12.251
- It's your wife.
- Amanda.

56:12.400 --> 56:15.210
- Are you okay?
- I don't know, are you?

56:15.360 --> 56:19.251
Yeah, I'm fine, baby.

56:19.400 --> 56:21.880
- Jesus, Nick, I'm scared.
- Don't be.

56:22.040 --> 56:24.805
- How did you get into this?
- I'm not in this.

56:24.960 --> 56:28.442
I was just meeting Patrick.
I would never do this to us.

56:32.040 --> 56:34.202
I need you to believe me.

56:34.360 --> 56:36.124
I had nothing to do with this.

56:40.280 --> 56:42.282
Let me talk to him.

56:44.480 --> 56:47.404
You have a very beautiful wife,
my friend.

56:47.560 --> 56:50.564
And I understand that
very soon you're gonna be a father.

56:50.760 --> 56:53.286
I would very much
like to see that happen,

56:54.520 --> 56:57.330
but I also have the power
to see that it doesn't happen.

56:57.480 --> 56:59.687
You got 30 minutes...
30 minutes from right now

56:59.840 --> 57:01.126
to put the hard drive
back in the safe.

57:01.280 --> 57:03.169
You walk out of there
with everything the way it was.

57:03.320 --> 57:05.641
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

57:05.800 --> 57:09.327
30 minutes or your wife,
your kid, your life, done.

57:09.480 --> 57:11.482
You understand that?

57:18.080 --> 57:20.082
I love you, too.

57:23.400 --> 57:26.404
- Very touching.
- Who has my wife?

57:27.600 --> 57:29.682
The police, who else?
Come on, on your way.

57:34.880 --> 57:37.724
Oh, no, don't. Don't!
We need him alive!

57:43.880 --> 57:45.723
If you ever pull a stunt
like that again,

57:45.880 --> 57:47.723
I will kill this woman.

57:47.880 --> 57:49.803
Yeah?

57:51.160 --> 57:53.128
Come on.

57:57.360 --> 58:00.170
As soon as we find her whereabouts,
I wanna know, that clear?

58:00.320 --> 58:02.288
Can I talk to you privately
for a second?

58:02.440 --> 58:04.442
- Give me a minute.
- Got it.

58:09.680 --> 58:12.001
What I'm about to tell you
stays between us, okay?

58:14.560 --> 58:17.609
I just found out the Feds
have an informant in the diner.

58:18.720 --> 58:21.405
That informant was about to come
forward with something vital

58:21.600 --> 58:23.170
to their whole operation.

58:23.320 --> 58:25.721
An active informant
in the diner now?

58:25.880 --> 58:28.008
- Who is it?
- I don't know,

58:28.160 --> 58:29.889
and they won't say.

58:30.040 --> 58:33.362
There's fear of a leak
in the department.

58:34.520 --> 58:35.851
They gotta protect the guy.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.729
The wrong people
find out who he is...

58:39.320 --> 58:41.607
well, I don't need to tell you.

58:47.200 --> 58:49.407
- Matthews.
- Hear me very fucking clearly.

58:49.560 --> 58:51.289
The assholes who pulled this

58:51.440 --> 58:53.363
cannot walk out of that diner.

58:53.520 --> 58:55.602
Understood.

58:55.800 --> 58:57.768
What about Davenport?

58:57.920 --> 59:00.400
Same order.
We clean this up.

59:03.760 --> 59:06.604
- Oi, where are you off to?
- I need the toilet.

59:06.760 --> 59:08.649
- A number one or number two?
- What?

59:08.800 --> 59:10.245
Because if it's a number two,

59:10.440 --> 59:13.125
allow me to provide you
with a magazine to read.

59:13.320 --> 59:14.651
What do you want me to do?
I need a piss.

59:14.800 --> 59:16.564
Hurry UP!

59:32.760 --> 59:34.364
Shots fired, shots fired!

59:34.520 --> 59:35.726
Shots fired, shots fired!

59:35.920 --> 59:37.524
The cops are trying
to come in through the back!

59:37.680 --> 59:40.604
Everyone stay there
and be fucking cool.

59:40.800 --> 59:42.325
Stay where you are!

59:44.720 --> 59:46.768
Nick, what's going on in there?

59:46.920 --> 59:48.649
- Nick?
- Come over here.

59:48.800 --> 59:50.165
Pick up that radio.

59:50.320 --> 59:51.970
You tell them if they even try
to come in here,

59:52.120 --> 59:54.771
I will execute every last hostage.

59:55.760 --> 59:58.127
The cops are trying to come in
through the back, man.

59:58.320 --> 01:00:01.961
You promised us.
People are going to die.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.561
- It was a mistake, Nick.
- Let me talk to him.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:07.200
I'm gonna straighten it out.
Stand down!

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:10.443
Stand down!
Nobody go near the damn diner!

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:11.965
Back, get back!

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.088
Get us that SUV
and get us the hell outta here!

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.567
Back where you were.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.200
Everyone stay calm.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:25.248
- All right, Bill?
- Yeah, fine. You?

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.243
Never better.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.920
SWAT tried to go through
the back door.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.650
- Who gave the order?
- Nobody ordered it.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.485
I'm in full command of this situation,
you understand that?

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.210
A couple of our guys went
to take a look and got made.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.561
It was a mistake.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.768
Those guys don't make mistakes,
they follow orders.

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.720
If you're trying to go behind my back,
it's gonna be a fucking problem.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.842
Oh, come on.
We're in this together.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.731
So what's going on?

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.645
I'm guessing it's a boy.

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:00.604
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.643
Knew it.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.729
I have four sisters,

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.247
so you learn these things.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.129
When you carry a baby low,

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.886
like you, it's a boy.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:15.567
Bet your husband,
he's happy it's a boy, I bet, huh?

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:18.966
Yeah.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:23.966
SUV's here.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.405
Hey, Nick?

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.927
Tell him you're gonna come out
and check the SUV.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.168
Make sure there's no surprises.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:42.011
- I'm here.
- SUV's here.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.969
Gassed up and ready to go.

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.122
You owe me four hostages.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.370
I've gotta check it first.

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.489
I'm coming out.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.803
I never got to have kids.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.002
I'm sorry to say.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.888
I lead a very quiet life.

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.327
It gives me time
to think about things.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.963
I have this clock at home
that always helps me think.

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.051
It's a piece of ormolu.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.645
Did you ever hear of it?

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:23.764
It's golden, French, 1800s.

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.082
It's a beautiful piece, beautiful.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.208
But guess what they call it?

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.609
A death clock.

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.483
It's got these
two pudgy cherubs holding it.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:42.490
All kinds of flowers.

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.608
It's very Louis XIV.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:47.882
Everything's plated with gold.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.609
This is back
when they used mercury

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.001
to plate the gold to the brass.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:56.288
These poor schmucks,
they didn't know any better.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:00.446
Once a clock was plated
and perfect,

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.682
they'd heat up the clock

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.803
to burn off the mercury,

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.327
and the room that they were in

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:11.451
would fill with poison gas.

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.286
Their hands, clothes,

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.801
their lungs...

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.088
it was a disaster.

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.607
Everyone who built these clocks...

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.081
these beautiful clocks...

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.089
died.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.806
The clock makers,
the apprentices,

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.450
the children.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.967
Their whole families, dead.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.561
You got directions
on the dashboard

01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:40.200
to a secure gate at the airport
where they'll walk you through,

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.210
but you still can do this
another way.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.205
Is the jet ready?

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:56.802
I have a clean shot.
Waiting for a go.

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.883
There's been a short delay,
but it'll be ready by

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:01.441
- the time you get to the airport.
- How long?

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:04.524
- No more than an hour.
- That's too long!

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.648
There's nothing I can do
about that, Nick.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:10.361
- The jet is not there.
- No, that doesn't work!

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.164
What's he doing?

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.607
Imagine that.

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.081
Imagine a man

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:23.810
mastering a craft that he hopes

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.685
will provide for his family

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:29.770
only to destroy
everyone that he loves

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:33.891
and kills himself, too.

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:39.810
- Who's got my wife?
- We're trying to locate her.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.884
Answer me.
Where's my wife?

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.566
- Amanda's fine, Nick.
- That's bullshit!

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.121
I spoke to her,
someone's got her!

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.362
We don't know where she is now.

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:58.683
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:00.490
We need him back in here.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.881
Oh, I'll just skip on out there
and pull him in, shall I?

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:04.928
- Shut up.
- God damn it,

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.969
I trusted you.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.885
- You lied to me.
- Nicky, Nicky, Nicky,

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.088
- Stand down!
- Stop!

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.648
It's pitiful to think about.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.082
So...

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.963
I just sit

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.691
staring at my clock.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.649
Do you think before the end,

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.928
before his last breath,

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.811
the clock maker had any idea

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.883
he was killing himself

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.765
and his family, too?

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:46.531
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Nick.

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.206
You wanna help these people?

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.844
You go in there and you end it

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.684
or someone's gonna die.

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.285
We have a direct threat.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.362
Take him out.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.089
No, no, no!

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.286
Oh, God! Nick!

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:26.169
Bravo Team,
you're clear to take the back door, go!

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.601
Stay down!
Everyone, stay down!

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.201
Stay down! Stay down!

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:42.484
Derrick, what's plan B?

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.290
This.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.126
Derrick?!

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.804
Derrick?!

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:53.247
- Sorry, mate.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.002
- Derrick?!

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.211
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:06.447
Derrick, please!

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:08.840
Put your gun down!
Put your gun down!

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.724
Freeze!
Let me see your hands!

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.929
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.570
I'm fine.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.411
One of them's in the kitchen.
He's got a hostage. Go!

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.449
- Clear.
- Clear.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.090
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.083
Move it, move!

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.730
- Clear.
- Clear.

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:36.531
They're killing the hostages!
Get in there, go!

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.409
Hurry!

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:41.211
Nick, Nick.
What is going on with Amanda?

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.203
Tell me what you know
and we'll find her.

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.444
Nick? Nick, talk to me.

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.324
Nick?!

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.850
Hey, that was
a hostage you shot,

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.444
for Christ's sake.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.490
Officers, I'll finish this up.

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:23.207
Wow, Yuri, that was quite a fucking mess
we had on our hands there.

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:25.203
It was three Brits
that came in and did this!

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:26.645
Yeah, and Davenport
was the ringleader.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.041
Your man has his wife.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.770
That kid?
You've got shit for brains, Barnes.

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.048
- He wasn't behind any of it.
- What?

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.443
Give me your phone.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.564
- It's me.
- You okay?

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.929
Davenport's not our guy.
He's just a pawn.

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:55.202
Whoever pulled this
got the drive.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.771
Find him.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.769
What do you want me to do
with the wife?

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.647
- Unit three, do you copy?
- Go, three.

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:07.081
Did anyone come out
the back of the diner?

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.846
Uniform they had hostage. Nobody else.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.048
Do you have eyes
on that individual now?

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.328
- Negative.
- Fuck it.

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.966
Tell them to check
the bathroom.

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:19.566
- Check the bathroom.
- Copy that.

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:30.005
We've got what appears to be
Will Tompkins' dead body here.

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.488
He's got no shirt.
Repeat, he's got no shirt.

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.566
The uniform that went out
the back was our perp.

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.324
Find the son of a bitch.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.091
We'll get him, Yuri.
We'll get him.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.805
All emergency responders,

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:54.009
diner suspect at large
driving a black and white.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.686
- PD fleet two...

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:58.280
You understand this.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:01.842
You got 30 minutes... 30 minutes
to put the hard drive back in the safe

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.846
or your wife,
your kid, your life, done.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.083
Oh, no, no, no. Come on.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.681
Watch where you're going,
you stupid bitch.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.320
You hear the siren?
Are you fucking deaf?

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.322
Oi, are you blind?!

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.244
Watch where you're going,
you stupid cow.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:22.210
Get off your cell phone, lady.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.044
There you go, there you go.

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.209
Hey, man, come back!

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.408
Mike, he just ran out!

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.449
Turn around.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.604
Call everyone.

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.922
I want the bastard
who took the hard drive.

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.362
- Hello?
- All right, Barnes.

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:48.126
I've got your hard drive,
but now it's gonna cost you.

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:51.449
- Who is this?
- Who's this?

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.887
- Who the hell are you?

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:57.562
You're the one who's got Lieutenant
Barnes's phone, but you're not him.

01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:01.486
You're speaking to Yuri Mikhalev.

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.291
That's my drive you've got.

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:09.727
Well, then this might be
both of our lucky day.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:32.730
Mrs. Davenport, it's over.

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.882
Time to go home.

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.682
Easy, mate, easy.

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.283
Charlie was my friend.

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:52.603
He bled to death in his own office.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.168
I knew him 30 years.

01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:58.448
You're that fellow with the fancy watch.

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.921
- Yuri Mikhalev.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.048
Christ.

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:05.240
If I would have known
it was you in there all night,

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.442
I would've watched me
Ps and Qs.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.003
I should kill you right now.

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:19.407
You could do that,

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:22.450
but then you'd never see
your precious hard drive again, eh?

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.365
Baby, I promise this is the last car

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.170
I'm ever breaking into.

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.561
As for your friend Charlie,

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.529
my condolences,

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:36.127
but I lost two of my colleagues
in that royal fuck up.

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:44.931
It's not me you should blame,
it's Barnes.

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:47.048
I am.

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:48.361
I did.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.361
Boss, Barnes got the message.

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:54.730
Unless you want to join him,
you better give me the drive.

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.849
Money first.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.766
- He probably left it in the car.
- Happy hunting.

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:04.651
Do you think I'm fucking stupid?

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:10.405
How do I know
you didn't make a copy?

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.562
I barely had enough time
to ditch the cruiser

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:14.165
when I got out of that diner.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:17.324
Who do you think I am,
Harry fucking Houdini?

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:31.969
Oi, the money's light.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.407
This is the best I could do
on such short notice.

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.643
Who do you think I am?
Harry Houdini?

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.243
Hey, tell your dog
to put that piece away.

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.482
This is a family establishment.

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:46.927
We don't want
any unnecessary attention.

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.407
Put it away.

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:51.369
Barnes thought
you made a deal with the FBI.

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:55.320
- He thought you sold him out.
- Barnes was an idiot.

01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:58.131
A lot of people suffered
because of your actions tonight.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:00.931
My men almost executed
the kid's wife.

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:02.923
They were an unlucky couple.

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:04.491
Wrong place at the wrong time.

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:07.445
- What'd you do with 'em?
- The girl has been released

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:09.688
and now the police know
Davenport had nothing to do

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:12.571
- with what happened at the diner.
- Ended up all right, then, didn't it?

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:16.167
By the way,
I am that fucking stupid.

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:37.965
Right.

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:42.005
Here's your hard drive.

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.886
I told you
I didn't want any heroes.

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.441
A lot of people are dead

01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.608
or will go to jail
because of that drive.

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:05.046
Why don't you tell me about
the gig that Charlie gave you?

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:10.331
I... I just had to give
a message to somebody.

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:12.881
We know who you went to see.

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.327
It's on for the 12th,
you got that?

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:17.363
A friend of mine said
that the police were all excited

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.881
about hearing something
that was on for the 12th.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:22.520
- So?
- There was nothing on for the 12th.

01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:24.569
There was no FBI sting.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:26.802
That was just a test.

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.849
We knew someone was giving
information at the diner,

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.162
we just didn't know who.

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:35.447
It was you.

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.728
You're the fuckin' rat.

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:40.042
The FBI are gonna hit us.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:43.044
I want you to tell 'em
it's on for the 12th.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.521
Unfortunately for my boss,

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:47.808
once Barnes got the message,
he got paranoid

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:50.440
and set in motion
the clusterfuck at the diner.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.729
Thought I'd find you here.

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:18.803
Come in,
I want you to see something.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.968
Come on, come on!

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:25.644
Huh?

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.922
- What do you think?
- Hey.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.889
It's not bad.
It's not bad at all.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.923
Thanks for doing this.

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.287
I forgot how handy
having you around can be.

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.929
Sorry I doubted you, man.

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.969
Recovered as evidence.

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.849
Try not to lose it this time.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.606
That hard drive you gave me
is gonna do a lot of good.

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:00.890
You're in the clear, Nick.

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:04.202
I pulled some strings.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.362
Thank you.

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:17.247
- I'm gonna get going.
- Hey,

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:19.721
any lead on the guy
who took me?

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:22.645
No, but we'll get him.

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:26.402
I'll see ya.

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.562
Back to work.

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:36.845
- Those are screws.
- I know.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.207
- I knew that.
- Ta-da.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.044
Springs.

01:21:42.305 --> 01:21:48.276
