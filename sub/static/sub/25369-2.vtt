WEBVTT

00:07.966 --> 00:10.844
Ow! Watch where you're
throwing those, buddy!

00:10.844 --> 00:12.804
They're still
rebuilding Oscorp.

00:12.804 --> 00:15.891
Don't care. Paladin steals
what he's hired to steal,

00:15.891 --> 00:18.227
no matter what,
or who, is in the way.

00:18.227 --> 00:19.520
[grunts]

00:19.520 --> 00:21.647
"Paladin"? You look
nothing like one.

00:21.647 --> 00:23.065
Paladins were knights.

00:23.065 --> 00:24.858
Trust me. I've been
to many a Ren Faire.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.276
It's a code name.

00:26.276 --> 00:29.112
We don't all have to
dress like team mascots.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.864
[chuckling]
Ouch!

00:30.864 --> 00:32.741
Hey, smile for my web‐cam.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.035
Get it? "Web"‐cam? Ha ha!

00:35.035 --> 00:37.204
Filming yourself
fighting a trained
mercenary, kid?

00:37.204 --> 00:39.998
Haven't you had your butt
kicked in public enough?

00:43.043 --> 00:45.837
Uh, sure, but there are three
reasons I'm not giving up:

00:45.837 --> 00:48.632
Isaac Newton, Thomas Edison,
and Albert Einstein.

00:48.632 --> 00:50.509
Shut up. We're fighting here.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.261
Sure. Happy to explain.

00:52.261 --> 00:54.263
Three great scientists,
all my heroes,

00:54.263 --> 00:56.473
but I heard Newton
dropped out of grade school.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.058
Edison said he failed
almost a thousand times

00:58.058 --> 00:59.977
before he perfected
the light bulb.

00:59.977 --> 01:03.981
And rumor has it Einstein
struggled to learn basic math.

01:03.981 --> 01:06.441
Know what that means?
It means I don't care.

01:06.441 --> 01:09.861
Wrong. It means a true hero
never gives up.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.613
[men shouting]

01:11.613 --> 01:13.448
I used to think
you were some weirdo,

01:13.448 --> 01:15.909
but now I know
you're our weirdo.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.287
Eh, that was supposed
to be a compliment.

01:18.287 --> 01:21.790
[groaning]
Trust me. I appreciate that
more than you know.

01:21.790 --> 01:24.167
[trilling]
Well done, Paladin.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.211
Exactly the data we need.

01:28.171 --> 01:31.425
Blurry. Blurry. Sky. Blurry.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.969
Elbow. Huh. My rear end.

01:33.969 --> 01:35.137
Nothing usable.

01:35.137 --> 01:37.055
[phone buzzes]

01:37.055 --> 01:39.683
Well, if it isn't
Harry Osborn,

01:39.683 --> 01:41.351
the world‐famous traveler.

01:41.351 --> 01:44.229
<i>Yeah. As if overseeing</i>
<i>the European operations</i>

01:44.229 --> 01:46.315
<i>of my dad's company</i>
<i>is a vacation.</i>

01:46.315 --> 01:47.858
<i>Hey, I don't have much time.</i>

01:47.858 --> 01:49.484
<i>Just called to wish you</i>
<i>luck this year.</i>

01:49.484 --> 01:50.944
<i>Isn't tonight Horizon's</i>
<i>Back to School Night?</i>

01:50.944 --> 01:52.237
It sure is.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.324
But it might also be
my farewell to school night.

01:55.324 --> 01:56.533
Classes start Monday,

01:56.533 --> 01:58.160
and if I can't get
Spidey footage

01:58.160 --> 01:59.453
to sell to the <i>Daily Bugle,</i>

01:59.453 --> 02:00.787
I can't afford tuition.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.998
<i>I told you, Pete, I can help.</i>

02:02.998 --> 02:06.001
Nah. This is something
I have to do on my own.

02:06.001 --> 02:08.503
Uncle Ben taught me
the importance of being
self‐sufficient.

02:08.503 --> 02:11.340
And besides,
after all the trouble
I've been through recently,

02:11.340 --> 02:13.216
the law of averages says

02:13.216 --> 02:14.718
my luck has to change
at some point.
[students screaming]

02:14.718 --> 02:17.596
[Doc Ock]
Doctor Octopus has returned!

02:17.596 --> 02:21.141
I come for what is mine.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.934
But maybe not today.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.479
Uh, Harry, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.326
All of this was inevitable.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.453
Who is that guy?

02:41.453 --> 02:43.955
Ha! Freshman.

02:43.955 --> 02:47.626
It's taken months,
but now it's my time.

02:47.626 --> 02:51.171
Miles, we need to change
into our work clothes.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.048
It might not be necessary.

02:53.048 --> 02:55.342
I made some modifications
to my security bots.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.636
They're much more
proactive now. Watch.

02:57.636 --> 03:00.806
Otto, how are you
no longer in prison?

03:00.806 --> 03:02.265
You're not welcome here.

03:02.265 --> 03:04.226
Max Modell.

03:04.226 --> 03:05.852
Let me explain.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.355
No way. Let's shock
some sense into him.

03:08.355 --> 03:11.525
[grunts]
[bots shouting]

03:11.525 --> 03:13.568
[students clamoring]

03:15.737 --> 03:17.406
Gwen!

03:20.992 --> 03:23.286
Ock saved us?

03:23.286 --> 03:25.330
Okay, that's not very evil.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.499
I did not come
for a confrontation.

03:27.499 --> 03:30.335
You said you came
for what was yours.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.170
I assumed you meant revenge.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.172
What? No.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.883
Why would you think that?
I meant forgiveness.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.094
Was that not clear?

03:39.094 --> 03:40.303
You all understood,

03:40.303 --> 03:41.888
yes?
[students whimpering]

03:41.888 --> 03:44.349
Hmm. Perhaps not.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.685
I regret last year.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.562
I fell in with a bad crowd‐‐

03:48.562 --> 03:50.313
Osborn and his goons‐‐

03:50.313 --> 03:54.151
and I let myself be fueled
by my own insecurities.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.986
Why are you coming
back here now?

03:55.986 --> 03:58.321
Parker?
Hmm. A fair question

03:58.321 --> 04:00.157
from a student
who's brighter

04:00.157 --> 04:01.783
than I ever
gave him credit.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.285
I was recently released

04:03.285 --> 04:06.788
from a facility for
so‐called supervillains,

04:06.788 --> 04:08.081
The Cellar.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.000
They thought
you paid for your crimes

04:10.000 --> 04:11.209
after such a short time?

04:11.209 --> 04:15.005
They promote intensive
criminal rehabilitation.

04:15.005 --> 04:17.299
While imprisoned,
I tried to be productive,

04:17.299 --> 04:18.675
earning three doctorates.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.261
And, to repay
my debt to society,

04:21.261 --> 04:24.097
I would like to offer
my teaching services

04:24.097 --> 04:26.099
to Horizon High again.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.684
For free, of course.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.395
I'm sorry.
After the things you did,

04:30.395 --> 04:32.606
you are not welcome here.

04:32.606 --> 04:37.611
[sighs] While this
is not the outcome
I was hoping for,

04:37.611 --> 04:38.945
I understand.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.281
Perhaps, to help me
start a new life,

04:41.281 --> 04:44.493
might I be able
to pack up my old lab
while I'm here?

04:44.493 --> 04:46.161
Please be quick.

04:46.161 --> 04:48.497
And a security bot
will keep an eye on you.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.332
That is only fair.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.376
[chattering]

04:53.376 --> 04:55.253
Max might be too harsh.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.798
Dr. Octavius
has clearly changed

04:57.798 --> 04:59.299
and wants to make amends.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.426
What ever happened
to second chances?

05:01.426 --> 05:04.304
Hello! Ock created
the Sinister Six.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.139
He mind‐controlled
Spider‐Man.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.266
And he just saved our lives.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.185
After putting them
at risk.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.187
When your robots attacked him.

05:12.187 --> 05:14.940
Welcome to Horizon High's
Back to School Night.

05:14.940 --> 05:17.526
I know this is going to be
one of our best years ever.

05:17.526 --> 05:20.237
Now let's start
this program off right

05:20.237 --> 05:23.573
with the announcement
of Horizon's annual project.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.367
This year it's a doozy.

05:25.367 --> 05:28.411
I give you a quantum leap
in computer science‐‐

05:28.411 --> 05:30.247
the Neuro Cortex.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.457
[gasping, murmuring]

05:32.457 --> 05:34.584
A self‐sustaining database

05:34.584 --> 05:36.711
modeled after
the human brain itself,

05:36.711 --> 05:40.507
utilizing a unique mix
of chemistry and electronics.

05:40.507 --> 05:43.468
When finished, it could
revolutionize medicine,

05:43.468 --> 05:47.848
energy, travel, and even
how the Internet itself runs.

05:47.848 --> 05:51.184
We're talking
about the potential
to change the world.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.812
[students chattering]
Ohh. Where's Anya?

05:53.812 --> 05:55.230
She'd love this.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.112
[buttons beep]

06:05.282 --> 06:07.534
Hey. You missed
Max's presentation.

06:07.534 --> 06:10.495
Aleksei's doctors
give me limited access
to him each day.

06:10.495 --> 06:13.665
If I'm gonna find a way
to permanently cure him
of his rhino transformation,

06:13.665 --> 06:15.333
I need every second.

06:17.419 --> 06:20.422
So, is it true?
Doc Ock is back?

06:20.422 --> 06:22.757
Only to get his stuff
and leave.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.467
Max knows better
than to trust him.

06:24.467 --> 06:25.844
But it's a shame.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.722
Ock has been working hard
to rehabilitate himself,

06:28.722 --> 06:30.640
and it's not fair we aren't
giving him a chance.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.559
Not fair?

06:32.559 --> 06:34.477
Look at what Ock
did to Aleksei.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.521
He's not a man
who can ever be trusted.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.357
[phone buzzing]

06:39.357 --> 06:41.151
Max wants to talk to me?

06:41.151 --> 06:42.152
Uh‐oh.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.488
[Max sighs]
This is uncomfortable,

06:45.488 --> 06:47.824
but I'm sure you know
why I called you here.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.409
I know, Max.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.786
I'll have my tuition money
in soon, I promise.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.622
I just need
a couple more days.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.042
Unfortunately,
I don't know how long

06:57.042 --> 06:58.501
I can keep your spot
open here

06:58.501 --> 06:59.961
if we don't get a payment.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.505
And trust me.
I don't want to lose you.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.883
You're one of my most
promising students at Horizon,

07:04.883 --> 07:08.303
and I need your help
on the Neuro Cortex.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.430
It sounds like
an amazing project.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.601
It is. But like anything
this complex,

07:14.601 --> 07:16.436
it's also frustrating.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.731
For instance,
like a human brain,
it has two lobes,

07:19.731 --> 07:23.318
but I'm having trouble
getting them to communicate
with one another.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.320
Have you considered
embedding connections

07:25.320 --> 07:28.031
to simulate
neuronal cell bodies
in human gray matter?

07:29.491 --> 07:31.910
[sighs]
I came to tell you

07:31.910 --> 07:33.953
that I retrieved
all my equipment

07:33.953 --> 07:38.249
and am exiting Horizon
for the final time.

07:38.249 --> 07:40.126
Good‐bye, Doctor.

07:43.672 --> 07:44.881
Hmm.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.510
Otto. That idea‐‐

07:48.510 --> 07:49.803
simulated gray matter.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.429
What made you think of it?

07:51.429 --> 07:52.889
Like I mentioned,

07:52.889 --> 07:54.891
I recently obtained
a few more doctorates,

07:54.891 --> 07:57.018
including one
in neurochemistry.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.603
Not to sound overconfident,

07:58.603 --> 08:00.730
but I am certain
it would work.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.233
I'll put it
under consideration.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.195
[Silver Sable]
Everything is in alignment.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.621
Boom! If a camera
webbed to my wrist

08:16.621 --> 08:18.665
can't get decent footage
to sell to the <i>Bugle,</i>

08:18.665 --> 08:20.792
maybe this drone
can do the job.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.168
Let's test you out.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.837
Ohh, nice!

08:23.837 --> 08:26.005
Big bucks, here I come.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.008
[beeping]

08:30.635 --> 08:31.553
Hmm.

08:35.140 --> 08:37.350
Something's not right.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.560
Show your hall pass.

08:44.566 --> 08:45.567
[grunts]

08:48.737 --> 08:49.738
Boo!

08:51.072 --> 08:53.616
Man, this is a bad day
to be a security bot.

08:53.616 --> 08:57.620
Ah. Horizon's spider mascot.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.456
Our client said
we might run into you.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.750
Whoa. "We"?

09:01.750 --> 09:03.710
Wild Pack.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.712
You thought the police
could hold me?

09:05.712 --> 09:07.505
Round two, kid.

09:07.505 --> 09:11.176
And this time I've brought
some friends to the party.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.720
Something about the name
"Wild Pack" tells me

09:13.720 --> 09:15.764
this isn't going to be
a slumber party, is it?

09:17.974 --> 09:20.560
Paladin, Puma,
Battlestar.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.146
We've studied his moves.
Take him down.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.023
Uhh!

09:27.317 --> 09:29.903
You've studied me?
I'm flattered.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.614
Of course.
We're professionals.

09:32.614 --> 09:35.617
You didn't really
think I was stealing
from Oscorp, did you?

09:38.203 --> 09:39.412
Uhh!

09:39.412 --> 09:40.914
Wild Pack, target acquired!

09:40.914 --> 09:42.040
Move out!

09:47.629 --> 09:49.756
[groaning]

09:49.756 --> 09:52.425
Oh, good.
Glad you got all that.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.721
Okay. Four weirdoes
in bizarre costumes

09:56.721 --> 09:58.723
can't just disappear
without a trace, can they?

09:58.723 --> 10:00.725
Of course, this is New York
I'm talking about.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.560
[Doc Ock]
Help me! Anyone!

10:02.560 --> 10:04.729
[muffled grunting]

10:04.729 --> 10:08.650
Doc Ock, do I even want
to know how you got
into this situation?

10:08.650 --> 10:09.818
Aah!

10:11.027 --> 10:12.445
Did they get away?

10:12.445 --> 10:13.822
I heard commotion
at Horizon

10:13.822 --> 10:15.448
and saw that group

10:15.448 --> 10:17.033
of oddly‐dressed
individuals

10:17.033 --> 10:19.202
running off
with the Neuro Cortex.

10:19.202 --> 10:20.578
I tried to stop them,

10:20.578 --> 10:22.080
but they clearly have
technology

10:22.080 --> 10:23.706
I was not prepared for.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.416
Yeah, well, now they have
some more tech,

10:25.416 --> 10:26.626
and that's a big problem.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.919
I'll help you track them.

10:27.919 --> 10:30.547
The Neuro Cortex
in the wrong hands

10:30.547 --> 10:32.757
could spell
unmitigated disaster.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.759
I am aware of its
dangerous potential

10:34.759 --> 10:36.803
because I recently obtained
a few doctorates‐‐

10:36.803 --> 10:38.847
In neurochemistry.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.390
Yeah, you mentioned that.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.599
How do you know that?

10:41.599 --> 10:44.561
I haven't seen you
in months, Spider‐Man.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.604
[chuckling]
Uh, oh, oh, yeah, right.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.648
I mean, that's‐‐
th‐that's what I heard.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.817
Eh, c‐congrats.
Doctorates are great.

10:50.817 --> 10:51.651
Love 'em.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.403
Since they're now
long gone,

10:53.403 --> 10:54.821
the first thing
we need to do is‐‐

10:54.821 --> 10:56.197
[chuckling]
Whoa. Whoa.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.991
There is no "we" here.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.993
I'm on this. This is me.

10:59.993 --> 11:04.581
But I'm offering my brilliance
to assist you, for free.

11:04.581 --> 11:08.168
Ock, call me crazy, but I
don't exactly trust you.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.628
Look, we don't have the best
history, you and me.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.297
[sighs]

11:12.297 --> 11:13.756
Did you know Edison said

11:13.756 --> 11:16.134
he failed almost
a thousand times

11:16.134 --> 11:18.845
before he streamlined
the design of the light bulb?

11:18.845 --> 11:22.473
That he was completely
dismissed by his peers?

11:22.473 --> 11:26.603
If he had not been given
more opportunities
to prove his worth,

11:26.603 --> 11:28.521
we would never
have benefited

11:28.521 --> 11:30.732
from his world‐changing
discoveries.

11:30.732 --> 11:33.151
I know second chances
don't come easily,

11:33.151 --> 11:36.696
but, like Edison,
I am not going to give up.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.533
I don't expect you
to understand, Spider‐Man.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.748
No shock that mercenaries
like the Wild Pack

11:46.748 --> 11:48.750
don't exactly have
home addresses.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.793
Huh. But who hired them?

11:50.793 --> 11:53.338
I wonder if anybody
at the <i>Daily Bugle</i> could‐‐

11:53.338 --> 11:55.673
Oh, no. I have to get
my footage in within the hour

11:55.673 --> 11:57.425
to make the deadline!

11:58.760 --> 12:00.094
[J. Jonah Jameson]
Ha ha ha!

12:00.094 --> 12:02.680
Now, this is
what I'm talking about!

12:02.680 --> 12:05.016
Brock, get in here!

12:07.685 --> 12:10.521
Look at this fantastic
footage of Spider‐Man
this kid took.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.523
And he's still
in middle school.

12:12.523 --> 12:13.691
Hmph.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.360
High school.
Same difference.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.945
What grade are you in, Brock?

12:16.945 --> 12:19.656
Parker, you keep bringing me
this kind of footage,

12:19.656 --> 12:21.741
I'll keep writing you
these kinds of checks. Betty!

12:23.159 --> 12:24.369
[angry groan]

12:28.164 --> 12:30.833
One more of these,
and this month's tuition
will be no problem.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.128
The first day of school's
tomorrow.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.755
We have no other projects

12:35.755 --> 12:37.465
that could take its place
for the year?

12:37.465 --> 12:39.676
A cyber‐chemical interface

12:39.676 --> 12:41.886
of the Neuro Cortex's
complexity?

12:41.886 --> 12:43.846
None of our other projects
is even close

12:43.846 --> 12:45.139
to that level of ingenuity.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.850
The year's funding
is based on it.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.562
Cyber‐chemical interface.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.731
I've been trying
to track the Wild Pack

12:53.731 --> 12:56.401
when I should
have been tracking
the Neuro Cortex itself.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.945
The Cortex uses a chemical
with a rare heat signature,

12:58.945 --> 13:01.781
which is a lot easier to find
than dangerous mercenaries.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.241
[Silver Sable]
Two things. One,

13:03.241 --> 13:04.826
I'm impressed you found us.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.911
Our client picked
this transfer location

13:06.911 --> 13:07.829
for its isolation.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.164
And two, I can't believe

13:10.164 --> 13:12.875
you just walked out
into the open like that.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.795
We literally saw you
a mile away.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.256
But on the bright side,
my tracker works.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.591
You should have left us alone.

13:20.591 --> 13:23.970
Unless, of course,
you want to pay us off

13:23.970 --> 13:25.805
and buy back the device.

13:25.805 --> 13:29.350
What? That's all it would take?
Just buy it from you?

13:29.350 --> 13:32.020
[chuckles]
Everyone has a price.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.522
Say, 1.2 million.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.025
I'm a little short
on the 1.2 million,

13:37.025 --> 13:39.944
but I might be able
to scrounge up ten bucks.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.070
Wild Pack...

13:42.405 --> 13:45.033
keep him away
from the Neuro Cortex.

13:46.284 --> 13:47.994
Delta‐14 formation!

13:47.994 --> 13:51.330
Wait. You have actual
fight plans? Whoa!

13:51.330 --> 13:53.708
I'm used to villain teams
just yelling stuff out like,

13:53.708 --> 13:55.001
"Crush the spider!"

13:55.001 --> 13:55.793
[grunts]

13:58.004 --> 13:59.005
Ta‐da!

13:59.005 --> 14:00.631
Oh! Aah!

14:00.631 --> 14:02.258
You're rather juvenile

14:02.258 --> 14:04.343
for a superhero, aren't you?

14:04.343 --> 14:06.054
[voice cracks]
I'm older than you think.

14:06.054 --> 14:08.890
Nope. Ha. My voice totally
did not just crack.

14:08.890 --> 14:12.393
It's been a pleasure,
but this ends now.

14:12.393 --> 14:15.021
[growling]
Puma, destroy him.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.230
[snarling]

14:16.230 --> 14:18.316
The offer to buy you
out still stand?

14:18.316 --> 14:20.943
'Cause that ten dollars
is burning a hole
in my pocket.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.239
[grunt]
[Silver Sable]
Puma, destroy him.

14:28.076 --> 14:31.829
[Doc Ock]
Behold! The return
of the Octopus!

14:31.829 --> 14:35.666
Fighting valiantly on the side
of goodness and virtue.

14:35.666 --> 14:36.626
[grunts]

14:36.626 --> 14:38.169
Aah! [fretting]

14:38.169 --> 14:39.629
Never thought I'd say this,

14:39.629 --> 14:41.798
but I am so glad
to see you right now.

14:43.341 --> 14:44.884
How did you find me?
With this.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.720
I remembered the Neuro Cortex
uses a chemical

14:47.720 --> 14:49.639
with a rare
radiation signature.

14:49.639 --> 14:50.848
[Spider‐Man]
So you developed
a tracker

14:50.848 --> 14:52.225
that could zero in
on the signature.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.310
I did the exact same thing.

14:55.561 --> 14:56.604
[Doc Ock]
Really?

14:56.604 --> 14:58.481
The Spider‐Man
knows science?

15:00.775 --> 15:02.110
I have my moments.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.782
Clearly we are more alike
than we both realized.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.117
Huhh!

15:09.117 --> 15:11.661
Also, we both represent
multi‐limbed creatures

15:11.661 --> 15:13.454
for the purpose of justice.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.706
Epsilon‐ten formation!

15:18.209 --> 15:21.671
They utilize tactics
denoted by the Greek
alphabet?

15:21.671 --> 15:23.923
Uh‐huh. They have
their own evil playbook.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.466
That's probably something
you could've used

15:25.466 --> 15:27.510
with your Sinister Six.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.554
I never claimed to be
a good supervillain leader.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.890
Continue the formation.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.016
I'm pulling a Sigma‐12.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.935
Meet you
at Location Beta.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.480
Why can't you just say

15:39.480 --> 15:40.940
"Finish him off,
I'm running away"?

15:40.940 --> 15:42.400
[snarling]

15:45.570 --> 15:47.113
[growling]

15:47.113 --> 15:48.698
Spider‐Man!

15:54.495 --> 15:57.832
Uhh! Impact trauma
to my parietal pleura.

15:57.832 --> 16:00.084
Stay down. I have an idea.

16:16.475 --> 16:19.187
I don't want to be the filling
in a mercenary sandwich.

16:19.187 --> 16:20.897
Huh?

16:20.897 --> 16:22.899
Uhh!
Oof! Uhh!

16:28.529 --> 16:30.281
Ock, I got to get you
to a doctor.

16:30.281 --> 16:34.327
But we can't let Silver Sable
escape with the Cortex.

16:36.120 --> 16:39.498
I developed a backup plan
for this very circumstance.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.084
From this short distance,
[grunts]

16:42.084 --> 16:45.087
my tracker
can radically stimulate
the chemical containment.

16:45.087 --> 16:48.633
Blow it up? We can't
destroy the Neuro Cortex.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.509
Better destroyed
than letting her

16:50.509 --> 16:52.428
sell it to someone
with evil intentions.

16:52.428 --> 16:56.098
We can't stop her in time.
There's no chance.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.602
I bet that's
what they told Edison.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.190
[grunting]

17:09.654 --> 17:11.072
[thump]
Ohh.

17:11.072 --> 17:12.657
Don't you ever quit?

17:12.657 --> 17:14.951
It's really annoying,
isn't it?

17:19.580 --> 17:22.208
[grunting]

17:22.208 --> 17:24.335
You do know
no one's flying
this thing?

17:24.335 --> 17:25.503
[both shouting]

17:28.965 --> 17:30.216
Shouldn't have quit
those fencing lessons.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.301
You think
this is a joke?
[grunting]

17:32.301 --> 17:34.178
Of course not.
Under this mask,

17:34.178 --> 17:36.180
I'm making
a super serious face.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.019
Whoa! Aah!

17:43.604 --> 17:45.106
Aah!

17:48.651 --> 17:51.279
[chuckles]
Oh. Sorry.

17:51.279 --> 17:53.573
Should have taken that
ten‐spot when I offered.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.782
Your loss.

17:56.284 --> 17:59.203
I was wrong, Spider‐Man.
There was a chance.

17:59.203 --> 18:03.082
I am truly starting to learn
that there always is.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.792
Yeah.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.961
That's something I should
probably remember, too.

18:12.717 --> 18:15.928
Hey, Max. We picked up
a little back‐to‐school supply.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.263
[Max gasps]

18:18.264 --> 18:19.056
I don't‐‐

18:19.056 --> 18:20.474
I don't have the words

18:20.474 --> 18:22.101
to express my gratitude,
Spider‐Man.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.562
Don't thank me. If it
wasn't for Otto here,

18:24.562 --> 18:26.606
I would have been
Puma food.

18:26.606 --> 18:30.026
A device this advanced
belongs only with a mind

18:30.026 --> 18:32.320
capable of harnessing
its true potential‐‐

18:32.320 --> 18:34.739
yours, Max.

18:34.739 --> 18:37.992
Now, I won't
overstay my welcome.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.125
You realize, Max,

18:46.125 --> 18:47.793
the processing power,

18:47.793 --> 18:50.129
even in the prototype
Neuro Cortex,

18:50.129 --> 18:51.756
could cure poor Aleksei.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.799
With the right parameters,
it could run

18:53.799 --> 18:55.885
through every conceivable
chemical formulation

18:55.885 --> 18:57.011
in minutes.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.971
You think you can save him?

19:00.181 --> 19:02.016
I know I can.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.319
I do not support this idea.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.363
I have some doubts
as well, Anya,

19:15.363 --> 19:17.281
but we've tried
everything else,

19:17.281 --> 19:19.200
and Spider‐Man
has faith in Ock.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.014
Huh?
[gasps]

19:42.014 --> 19:43.140
[grunts]

19:43.140 --> 19:44.517
[gasps]
Huh.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.935
Oh.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.729
What?

19:48.729 --> 19:50.439
Where am I?

19:50.439 --> 19:52.983
Oh, I missed a lot,
didn't I?

19:52.983 --> 19:55.361
It's good to have you
back, Aleksei.

19:57.363 --> 20:00.282
And not only is
the Neuro Cortex prototype

20:00.282 --> 20:01.784
returned and operational,

20:01.784 --> 20:04.495
our year‐long research project
will be spearheaded

20:04.495 --> 20:09.542
by our returning professor,
Dr. Otto Octavius.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.293
[students exclaiming]
[applause]

20:16.340 --> 20:17.758
[clears throat, coughs]

20:19.301 --> 20:23.139
I know second chances
do not come often.

20:23.139 --> 20:26.350
I swear I will not disappoint
all of you students.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.819
Getting thrown in prison
was never part of the deal.

20:36.819 --> 20:39.113
No, it wasn't.

20:39.113 --> 20:41.031
But have patience, Paladin.

20:41.031 --> 20:43.409
Our client's plans are

20:43.409 --> 20:44.785
long‐term.

20:45.953 --> 20:48.038
[chattering]

20:51.125 --> 20:52.293
<i>[Jameson]</i>
<i>Look at this menace.</i>

20:52.293 --> 20:53.794
<i>He causes more damage</i>

20:53.794 --> 20:55.713
<i>than the so‐called bad guys</i>

20:55.713 --> 20:56.964
<i>and webs up</i>
<i>innocent students!</i>

20:56.964 --> 20:59.091
But that's not what happened.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.551
Whoa, Pete.

21:00.551 --> 21:02.636
Someone looks like they
just failed a test.

21:02.636 --> 21:05.389
Not that I would know
what that looks like.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.391
It's just...

21:08.434 --> 21:09.685
something didn't turn out

21:09.685 --> 21:10.978
like I thought it would.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.396
So?

21:12.396 --> 21:13.606
What about all the things

21:13.606 --> 21:15.483
that turned out
better than you thought?

21:15.483 --> 21:17.485
Ock's reformed.
Aleksei's back.

21:17.485 --> 21:20.362
Never dwell on the bad, Pete.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.697
You know what happened
to Edison, right?

21:21.697 --> 21:22.823
And Newton?
