NOT GUILTY... NOT GUILTY...

00:06.139 --> 00:08.241

NOT GUILTY...

00:08.308 --> 00:09.510
( sighs )

00:09.576 --> 00:10.844
GUILTY.

00:14.447 --> 00:16.349
WHAT?

00:16.416 --> 00:18.685
SARAH McQUEEN IS GUILTY

00:18.752 --> 00:23.156
AND APPARENTLY, I AM THE ONLY
SANE PERSON ON THIS JURY.

00:23.223 --> 00:25.258
GOOD. THEN WE CAN ALL
PLEAD INSANITY

00:25.325 --> 00:27.728
WHEN WE KILL YOU.

00:27.794 --> 00:29.696
DAMN STRAIGHT.
I'VE HAD MARRIAGES

00:29.763 --> 00:32.432
THAT DIDN'T TAKE AS LONG
AS THIS DELIBERATION.

00:32.497 --> 00:37.504
CONSIDERING YOUR LITTLE
ATTITUDE, I'M NOT SURPRISED.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.439
WELL, ANOTHER DAY SHOT.

00:39.506 --> 00:41.642
LET'S GO HOME,
KICK THE DOG

00:41.708 --> 00:43.376
AND RECONVENE
TOMORROW MORNING.

00:43.443 --> 00:46.680
UNLESS ONE OF US
GETS HIT BY A BUS.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.481
AND REMEMBER
THE JUDGE'S ADMONITION

00:48.549 --> 00:50.851
NOT TO DISCUSS
THE CASE WITH ANYONE.

00:50.917 --> 00:52.619
EVEN IF YOUR
FAMILY WONDERS

00:52.686 --> 00:56.723
WHY YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
TO YOUR WIFE'S GRAVE LATELY?

00:59.492 --> 01:01.902

OH, I KNOW, HAROLD,
I KNOW.

01:37.604 --> 01:41.107
SOMETIMES, LIFE
DOESN'T COOPERATE WITH OUR PLANS

01:41.174 --> 01:44.878
BUT REMEMBER, DISAPPOINTMENT
ENDS IN OINTMENT.

01:48.414 --> 01:49.950
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:50.016 --> 01:51.484
OINTMENT HEALS.

01:52.519 --> 01:56.422
WHAT'S CONFUCIUS
JACKSON UP TO?

01:56.489 --> 01:58.592
HA HA.

01:58.659 --> 02:00.794
"ACTORS
HELPING ACTORS."

02:00.861 --> 02:04.738
IT'S A CRISIS HOT LINE
FOR UNEMPLOYED ACTORS.

02:04.805 --> 02:09.342
SHOULDN'T SHE BE ON THE OTHER
END OF THAT PHONE CALL?

02:09.408 --> 02:10.711
SHOULDN'T YOU BE

02:10.776 --> 02:13.179
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE STREET?

02:13.246 --> 02:14.915
MY BABY
IS MORE THAN QUALIFIED

02:14.981 --> 02:16.550
TO MAN THOSE PHONES, OKAY?

02:16.617 --> 02:19.452
SHE HAD AN HOUR
AND A HALF OF INTENSIVE TRAINING

02:19.519 --> 02:23.089
PLUS A REFRESHER COURSE
IN PHONE HYGIENE.

02:23.156 --> 02:26.292
REMEMBER, IT TAKES
52 MUSCLES TO FROWN

02:26.359 --> 02:28.194
AND ONLY 19 TO SMILE.

02:28.261 --> 02:29.930
NOW, YOU DO THE HAPPY MATH.

02:29.996 --> 02:31.231
PEACE OUT.

02:32.298 --> 02:35.368
SO HOW'S HAROLD DOING,
MY CURVACEOUS COUNSELOR?

02:35.435 --> 02:36.770
NOT BAD, NOT BAD.

02:36.837 --> 02:39.139
HE STILL THINKS
EVERYBODY'S OUT TO GET HIM

02:39.205 --> 02:41.608
BUT HE'S BEGINNING
TO TRUST HIS CAT AGAIN.

02:41.675 --> 02:42.743
Kyle:
HEY, REGINE.

02:42.809 --> 02:43.944
HOW'S JURY DUTY?

02:44.010 --> 02:46.279
KYLE, NOW, YOU KNOW
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT

02:46.346 --> 02:48.014
AND BESIDES,
I ALREADY TOLD YOU ALL:

02:48.081 --> 02:50.116
I'M ON SOME BORING OLD TRIAL

02:50.183 --> 02:52.318
THAT NOBODY
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN.

02:52.385 --> 02:55.689
MM. I GUESS THEY MATCH THE CASE
WITH THE JUROR.

02:55.756 --> 02:58.559
TOO BAD YOU AIN'T
ON THAT SARAH McQUEEN CASE.

02:58.625 --> 03:01.635
MAYBE YOU COULD STRAIGHTEN OUT
THAT IDIOT JUROR

03:01.702 --> 03:03.369
THAT'S HOLDING UP

03:03.436 --> 03:04.538
THE DAD‐GONE
VERDICT!

03:06.540 --> 03:07.841
I‐IDIOT..?

03:07.908 --> 03:09.843
WELL, NOW, WHY DO YOU THINK

03:09.910 --> 03:12.813
THAT SHE'S...
OR HE'S... AN IDIOT?

03:12.879 --> 03:13.847
WELL, REPORTEDLY

03:13.914 --> 03:15.716
SOMEONE ON THAT JURY
IS CONVINCED

03:15.782 --> 03:17.317
THAT KINDHEARTED
OLD WOMAN

03:17.383 --> 03:19.786
COULD BURN DOWN
HER OWN HOUSE.

03:19.853 --> 03:22.288
EVEN THE PROSECUTOR ENDED
HIS CLOSING ARGUMENT WITH:

03:22.355 --> 03:25.491
"ON THE OTHER HAND,
I COULD BE WRONG."

03:25.559 --> 03:29.095
Overton:

03:36.036 --> 03:37.904
AND WHEEZY JEFFERSON SHOT J. F. K.

OOH, WHEEZY JEFFERSON!

03:39.706 --> 03:41.441
( laughing and talking at once )

03:41.508 --> 03:43.777
YOU GUYS, NOW, SARAH McQUEEN

03:43.844 --> 03:45.746
IS THE WOMAN
ACCUSED OF THE CRIME.

03:45.812 --> 03:46.747
MRS. BENCHLEY

03:46.813 --> 03:48.682
IS JUST A CHARACTER SHE PLAYS.

03:48.749 --> 03:51.017
DON'T CONFUSE THE ACTOR
WITH THE ROLE.

03:51.084 --> 03:52.018
YEAH.

03:52.085 --> 03:53.353
TELL THAT TO TOOTIE.

03:56.790 --> 03:59.225
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT...

04:00.834 --> 04:02.402
NO, NO, NO, REGINE.

04:02.468 --> 04:04.137
SHE REALLY IS SWEET.

04:04.204 --> 04:05.572
WHEN I INTERVIEWED HER

04:05.639 --> 04:07.641
SHE BROUGHT A MARBLE CAKE...

04:07.708 --> 04:08.909
AND GET THIS...

04:08.975 --> 04:12.178
HAD HER THREE ADOPTED
CAMBODIAN ORPHANS SING

04:12.245 --> 04:14.848
"I WILL SURVIVE."

04:16.750 --> 04:18.652
SARAH McQUEEN IS GUILTY!

04:18.719 --> 04:21.588
OR COULD BE GUILTY...

04:21.654 --> 04:22.923
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

04:22.989 --> 04:25.225
( woodenly ):
I'M NOT ON THAT JURY.

04:28.895 --> 04:30.396
STOP LOOKING AT ME.

04:31.932 --> 04:35.602
LOOK, THERE'S NOT ONE
SOLID PIECE OF EVIDENCE

04:35.669 --> 04:37.904
LINKING SARAH McQUEEN
TO THE CRIME.

04:37.971 --> 04:41.842
PLUS... 15 PEOPLE
TESTIFIED ON HER BEHALF

04:41.908 --> 04:46.179
INCLUDING THE ENTIRE CAST
OF <i>MY MOTHER, THE BOAT.</i>

04:46.246 --> 04:47.848
WHEN THE FIRE BROKE OUT

04:47.914 --> 04:51.217
McQUEEN WAS ON
A RED CROSS PLANE TO BOSNIA

04:51.284 --> 04:56.222
DELIVERING MEDICAL SUPPLIES
AND HOMEMADE PEANUT BRITTLE.

04:56.289 --> 04:59.359
AND YOU CALL THAT AN ALIBI?

05:00.767 --> 05:03.804
I HAVE YET TO HEAR
ONE GOOD REASON

05:03.870 --> 05:05.672
WHY SARAH McQUEEN
IS GUILTY.

05:05.739 --> 05:09.643
I HAVE GIVEN YOU SEVERAL,
AND HERE COMES ANOTHER:

05:09.710 --> 05:12.646
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
AN INNOCENT WOMAN

05:12.713 --> 05:16.717
WORE NUDE PANTYHOSE TWO SHADES
DARKER THAN HER OWN COMPLEXION?

05:23.857 --> 05:26.226
HOMEGIRL IS HIDING
SOMETHING.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.129
LIVER SPOTS.

05:29.195 --> 05:31.164
SHE'S 73.

05:31.231 --> 05:35.536
SHE BURNED DOWN HER HOUSE
FOR THE INSURANCE MONEY!

05:35.602 --> 05:38.739
YOU HEARD THE PROSECUTOR SAY
THAT SHE HASN'T WORKED

05:38.805 --> 05:42.075
SINCE SHE STARRED
IN <i>WHOOPS, I'M THE PRESIDENT.</i>

05:43.443 --> 05:46.179
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES,
THE JURORS IN A CASE‐‐

05:46.246 --> 05:48.682
THEY FORM A REAL BOND
AMONGST THEMSELVES

05:48.749 --> 05:51.017
AND AFTERWARDS,
THEY GET TOGETHER

05:51.084 --> 05:52.819
TO TALK OVER OLD TIMES

05:52.886 --> 05:55.556
AND SHARE NEW EXPERIENCES...
BUT NOT ON THIS CASE

05:55.622 --> 05:56.957
BECAUSE I HATE YOU.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.801
I SECOND.

06:00.867 --> 06:02.636
LET'S VOTE ON THAT. HANDS?

06:05.672 --> 06:07.173
Overton:
OKAY, BABY GIRL

06:07.240 --> 06:09.042
LET'S TEST
IT OUT.

06:09.109 --> 06:10.043
OKAY.

06:10.110 --> 06:11.745
RING, RING.

06:11.812 --> 06:13.179
ACTORS HELPING ACTORS.

06:13.246 --> 06:15.048
WHAT IS YOUR CRISIS?

06:16.583 --> 06:18.384
( chiding tone ):
OH, NOW, SYNCLAIRE

06:18.451 --> 06:21.321
DON'T PLAY WITH A LOADED PHONE
IN THE HOUSE.

06:21.387 --> 06:22.989
KHADIJAH, THIS IS NOT A JOKE.

06:23.056 --> 06:24.791
HAROLD
IS ONE OF MY DAILY CALLERS.

06:24.858 --> 06:27.027
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM
SINCE WEDNESDAY.

06:27.093 --> 06:28.595
WELL, MAYBE
HE FOUND A JOB.

06:28.662 --> 06:30.463
OR MAYBE HIS PHONE
GOT CUT OFF.

06:30.531 --> 06:32.198
OR MAYBE HE KILLED HIMSELF.

06:33.767 --> 06:36.069
OH, COME ON!

06:36.136 --> 06:38.505
LIKE YOU GUYS
WEREN'T THINKING THAT.

06:39.940 --> 06:41.207
YEAH, MAYBE SO

06:41.274 --> 06:43.877
BUT WE WERE ABLE
TO SNAP OUR MOUTHS SHUT

06:43.944 --> 06:46.513
BEFORE SOMETHING STUPID
CAME TUMBLING OUT.

06:46.580 --> 06:49.415
BUSTED AGAIN! ALL RIGHT,
SO, WHAT IS IT?

06:49.482 --> 06:51.051
SHOES OR SHIRT?

06:51.117 --> 06:53.053
EH... SHIRT.

06:55.355 --> 06:56.690
WELL, HELLO, MADAM JUROR.

06:56.757 --> 06:59.425
HAVE YOU DISCHARGED
YOUR CIVIC DUTY TODAY?

06:59.492 --> 07:00.934
NO. STILL DELIBERATING.

07:01.001 --> 07:02.368
THOSE ROCK HEADS.

07:02.435 --> 07:04.905
YOU GOT AN IDIOT HOLDOUT
ON YOUR JURY TOO?

07:04.971 --> 07:06.306
YOU KNOW, FOLKS

07:06.372 --> 07:09.009
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS
GOING ON IN THE WORLD

07:09.075 --> 07:11.111
BESIDES JURIES, HUH?

07:11.177 --> 07:14.815
MAD COW DISEASE‐‐
AREN'T THE COWS STILL MAD?

07:19.820 --> 07:21.622
STOP LOOKING AT ME.

07:21.688 --> 07:23.690
YOU GUYS, I HAVE SOMETHING

07:23.757 --> 07:26.226
I HAVE GOT TO GET
OFF MY CHEST.

07:26.292 --> 07:27.227
( laughs )

07:27.293 --> 07:28.629
STOP THAT.

07:30.664 --> 07:34.467
NOW, IF I TELL YOU,
SWEAR IT WILL GO NO FURTHER.

07:34.535 --> 07:35.802
OH, OF COURSE,
REGINE.

07:35.869 --> 07:37.470
WE'LL EVEN DO
A PINKY SWEAR.

07:37.538 --> 07:38.805
NOW, HOLD ON,
MAMA.

07:38.872 --> 07:42.142
LET'S SEE WHAT
SHE GOT FIRST.

07:44.645 --> 07:46.513
I AM ON THE...

07:48.248 --> 07:50.617
VERGE OF BUYING A NEW DRESS.

07:52.619 --> 07:54.955
HOW DO YOU LIVE
WITH YOURSELF?

07:58.625 --> 07:59.893
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.002
I DON'T KNOW.

08:02.068 --> 08:03.103
LISTEN.

08:03.169 --> 08:04.505
IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE

08:04.571 --> 08:06.439
MACARONI AND CHEESE
OUT OF A BOX

08:06.507 --> 08:08.408
YOUR BEST BET IS COUNT MACULAS.

08:08.474 --> 08:10.410
PLEASE! COUNT MACULA
WOULDN'T KNOW CHEESE

08:10.476 --> 08:13.814
IF A MAD COW DELIVERED
IT TO HIM.

08:13.880 --> 08:16.983
SEE, REGINE?
I WORKED IN YOUR TOPIC.

08:17.050 --> 08:19.686
I'M THE HOLDOUT JUROR
ON THE McQUEEN CASE!

08:21.387 --> 08:22.956
YOU KNOW, WHEN I MAKE

08:23.023 --> 08:25.158
MY FAMOUS BARKER
MACARONI AND <i>FROMAGE</i>

08:25.225 --> 08:27.928
I USE ONLY THE FINEST
AGED CHEDDAR

08:27.994 --> 08:29.663
WITH JUST A HINT OF
GOUDA, AND THEN YOU...

08:29.730 --> 08:32.866
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT I SAID?

08:34.067 --> 08:38.104
I'M THE IDIOT HOLDOUT THAT
WANTS McQUEEN LOCKED UP.

08:38.171 --> 08:39.105
WHAT?

08:39.172 --> 08:40.073
YOU'RE JOKING,
RIGHT?

08:40.140 --> 08:41.474
YOU'RE...

08:41.542 --> 08:42.743
THE IDIOT?

08:44.611 --> 08:47.180
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY
IS SAYING ABOUT ME!

08:47.247 --> 08:49.349
I'M ON THIS BIG,
CONTROVERSIAL CASE

08:49.415 --> 08:51.685
AND I CAN'T EVEN DEFEND MYSELF.

08:51.752 --> 08:54.454
I CAN'T EVEN GET
ON THE COVER OF <i>PEOPLE.</i>

08:55.989 --> 08:58.892
FREAK THAT. YOU'RE NOT EVEN
SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS THE CASE.

08:58.959 --> 09:00.961
YOU WANT ME DEAD, IS THAT IT?

09:01.027 --> 09:06.439
YOU JUST WANT ME TO EXPLODE
TRYING TO HOLD THIS JUICE IN.

09:06.507 --> 09:09.442
YEAH, WELL, IT SEEMS
THE JUICE IS LOOSE.

09:12.846 --> 09:15.081
ALL RIGHT, I...

09:15.148 --> 09:16.950
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL
ANYBODY ELSE.

09:17.017 --> 09:19.820
JUST MY IMMEDIATE, INTIMATE

09:19.886 --> 09:22.556
CIRCLE OF TRUSTED FRIENDS.

09:22.623 --> 09:24.424
AND MAX.

09:24.490 --> 09:27.127
AND THE JUDGE.

09:27.193 --> 09:29.062
WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:29.129 --> 09:30.664
YOU VIOLATED HIS ORDERS.

09:30.731 --> 09:33.399
NOW, EITHER YOU TELL THE JUDGE
WHAT YOU'VE DONE

09:33.466 --> 09:35.335
OR AS AN OFFICER OF THE COURT

09:35.401 --> 09:36.637
I AM OBLIGATED TO DO IT.

09:36.703 --> 09:37.904
I MEAN IT.

09:46.412 --> 09:48.181
LAST NIGHT

09:48.248 --> 09:51.552
ONE OF THE JURORS INFORMED ME
THAT SHE DISCUSSED THE CASE

09:51.618 --> 09:52.853
OUTSIDE THE JURY ROOM.

09:52.919 --> 09:54.254
OH, GOD! NO!
WHO?

09:54.320 --> 09:56.757
WHAT THE HELL!

09:56.823 --> 09:59.893
( gavel pounding )

09:59.960 --> 10:03.537
LET ME FIRST SAY
THAT SUCH UNSOLICITED HONESTY

10:03.604 --> 10:06.172
IS BOTH RARE AND REFRESHING...

10:07.508 --> 10:10.476
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING
THE HEINOUS NATURE

10:10.544 --> 10:12.112
OF HER TRANSGRESSION.

10:12.178 --> 10:13.914
THIS TIME

10:13.980 --> 10:17.217
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK
THAT THE JUROR COME FORWARD.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.788
YOU BETTER GET ON
UP THERE, GIRL.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.326
MISS HUNTER!

10:26.392 --> 10:29.295
DON'T MAKE ME USE
THE MAGIC HAMMER.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.266
OH, IF SHE KNEW THEY'RE
NOT GOING TO LET HER

10:33.333 --> 10:35.468
TAKE ALL THEM WIGS
TO THE BIG HOUSE.

10:37.904 --> 10:40.173
I WISH I HAD THE POWER

10:40.240 --> 10:43.343
TO SENTENCE A
CITIZEN TO SHAME.

10:43.409 --> 10:44.945
BUT, ALAS

10:45.011 --> 10:46.847
I DO NOT.

10:48.414 --> 10:51.151
COULD I GO NOW?

10:51.217 --> 10:52.485
JUST ONE MORE THING.

10:52.553 --> 10:54.320
I FIND YOU
IN CONTEMPT OF COURT

10:54.387 --> 10:55.689
AND SENTENCE YOU TO...

10:55.756 --> 10:57.290
EXCUSE ME,
YOUR HONOR!

10:57.357 --> 11:00.400
MAXINE SHAW, PUBLIC DEFENDER
AND PARK SLOPE ALDERWOMAN.

11:00.466 --> 11:02.869
YES, MISS SHAW.

11:02.936 --> 11:05.138
I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT
THE JUROR IS A SOLID CITIZEN

11:05.205 --> 11:06.339
WITH COMMUNITY...

11:06.406 --> 11:08.709
MISS SHAW! YOU ARE
AN OFFICER OF THE COURT

11:08.775 --> 11:11.277
AND A PUBLIC OFFICIAL
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME

11:11.344 --> 11:14.114
THAT YOU KNOW
THIS SIMPLETON?

11:15.682 --> 11:20.320
I REQUEST MY NAME AND COMMENTS
BE STRICKEN FROM THE RECORD.

11:20.386 --> 11:22.455
YOU SAVE YOURSELF, GIRL.

11:22.523 --> 11:23.489
DON'T YOU GO DOWN
WITH THAT SHIP!

11:23.557 --> 11:26.627
YOU KNOW IT'LL SINK!

11:26.693 --> 11:30.096
I HEREBY DISCHARGE YOU
FROM THIS JURY...

11:30.163 --> 11:32.032
( exclamations of relief )

11:32.098 --> 11:35.068
AND SENTENCE YOU TO 50
HOURS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE.

11:35.135 --> 11:38.304
I HAVE MADE ARRANGEMENTS
FOR YOU TO BAKE BREAD

11:38.371 --> 11:41.241
WITH THE BROTHERS
OF SEBASTIAN MONASTERY.

11:41.307 --> 11:43.710
THEY HAVE TAKEN A VOW
OF SILENCE.

11:43.777 --> 11:46.246
THE STATE CAN'T SEEM
TO GET YOU TO SHUT UP.

11:46.312 --> 11:49.716
PERHAPS GOD CAN.

11:49.783 --> 11:51.718
NOW, IF THE
REMAINING JURORS

11:51.785 --> 11:53.219
ALONG WITH THE ALTERNATE

11:53.286 --> 11:56.523
WOULD EXCUSE THEMSELVES
AND BEGIN DELIBERATION.

11:56.590 --> 11:59.693
I FEEL SORRY FOR THE POOR
ALTERNATE THAT HAS TO CONTEND

11:59.760 --> 12:01.467
WITH THIS GROUP OF ROCK HEADS.

12:01.535 --> 12:03.103
YOUR HONOR!

12:03.169 --> 12:04.738
WE'VE REACHED A VERDICT.

12:04.805 --> 12:08.408
WE FIND SARAH McQUEEN
NOT GUILTY.

12:09.375 --> 12:12.278
NO! NO!
IT'S A MISTAKE!

12:12.345 --> 12:13.413
IT'S A MISTAKE!

12:13.479 --> 12:16.550
Y'ALL CHECK UNDER HER WIG
FOR MATCHES!

12:16.617 --> 12:18.384
IT'S A MISTAKE!

12:18.451 --> 12:21.688
SARAH McQUEEN...
GOD IS WATCHING YOU.

12:21.755 --> 12:24.057
( gavel pounding )

12:24.124 --> 12:26.560
OH, HEY, KYLE.

12:26.627 --> 12:29.996
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK
OF THIS DRESS RIGHT HERE.

12:30.063 --> 12:34.635
FRANKLY, I NEVER PICTURED
YOU IN ANYTHING BACKLESS.

12:34.701 --> 12:37.403
IT'S A WEDDING DRESS
FOR SYNCLAIRE, OKAY?

12:37.470 --> 12:39.773
OH, IN THAT CASE, I SUGGEST
SOMETHING SHORT

12:39.840 --> 12:41.007
TO SHOW OFF HER LEGS.

12:41.074 --> 12:43.209
AND TO REDUCE
THE LIKELIHOOD OF TRIPPING.

12:43.276 --> 12:44.911
OH!

12:44.978 --> 12:48.014
OBIE! I FOUND HAROLD!

12:48.081 --> 12:51.151
HOW DID YOU MANAGE THAT,
MY PRECIOUS PRIVATE EYE?

12:51.217 --> 12:53.019
WELL, THE LAST TIME
HE CALLED

12:53.086 --> 12:54.487
HE SAID
HE WAS DROWNING

12:54.555 --> 12:57.558
HIS SORROWS IN A HOT LINK
AND PASTRAMI SANDWICH.

12:57.624 --> 12:59.960
SO YOU FOUND HIM
IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM

13:00.026 --> 13:01.768
GETTING HIS STOMACH PUMPED?

13:01.835 --> 13:04.204
KYLE, LET THE
MYSTERY UNFOLD.

13:04.270 --> 13:05.806
HEY, HEY, HEY.

13:05.872 --> 13:09.042
I REMEMBER THAT HAROLD LIVED
DOWNTOWN NEAR THE "F" TRAIN.

13:09.109 --> 13:14.881
SO I GO DOWN THERE AND I FIND
BIG MAMA'S HOT LINK HEAVEN.

13:14.948 --> 13:16.950
NOW BIG MAMA NOT ONLY KNEW HIM

13:17.017 --> 13:19.185
SHE RENTED HIM
THE ROOM UPSTAIRS.

13:19.252 --> 13:22.422
DAMN! APARTMENT ABOVE
HOT LINK HEAVEN

13:22.488 --> 13:25.091
GOT TO BE ONE
GREASY STAIRCASE.

13:25.158 --> 13:26.993
SO, HE WASN'T
AT HOME

13:27.060 --> 13:28.094
BUT HIS NEIGHBORS SAID

13:28.161 --> 13:30.330
HE HAD GONE OUT
TO GET SOME AIR.

13:30.396 --> 13:31.732
PROBABLY TO ESCAPE
THE STENCH

13:31.798 --> 13:34.635
OF ROASTING SWINE.

13:34.701 --> 13:37.838
I GO TO A NEARBY PARK
AND WHO DO YOU THINK

13:37.904 --> 13:41.407
IS SITTING ON A BENCH
EATING A HOT LINK SALAD?

13:41.474 --> 13:44.044
THE ARTIST
FORMERLY KNOWN AS PRINCE?

13:46.513 --> 13:48.715
NO! HAROLD!

13:48.782 --> 13:50.150
WHEN HE REALIZED
WHAT I HAD GONE THROUGH

13:50.216 --> 13:52.619
HE SAID HE WOULD PUT
ALL HIS DESPAIR

13:52.686 --> 13:55.455
BEHIND HIM AND
START LIVING FOR TODAY.

13:55.522 --> 13:58.692
ALL RIGHT, SYNCLAIRE, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S BRILLIANT SLEUTHING.

13:58.759 --> 14:01.201
TELL ME SOMETHING,
WHERE ARE YOUR SUNGLASSES?

14:01.267 --> 14:03.870
YOU KNOW, FUNNY YOU
SHOULD ASK THAT.

14:03.937 --> 14:06.507
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR THEM ALL DAY!

14:06.573 --> 14:08.875
THAT'S AMAZING.

14:13.279 --> 14:15.549
I AM AN INTERNATIONAL JOKE.

14:15.616 --> 14:19.853
A CAMERA CREW HAS FOLLOWED ME
INTO THE LADIES ROOM.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.888
AND A SPANISH COUPLE
CAME UP TO ME...

14:21.955 --> 14:22.989
TWO TOURISTS...

14:23.056 --> 14:25.158
'CAUSE THEY WANTED
TO TAKE A PICTURE

14:25.225 --> 14:26.960
WITH SENORITA BLABBERMOUTH.

14:27.027 --> 14:28.294
HEY, YOU GUYS
DON'T THINK

14:28.361 --> 14:30.496
I HAVE A PROBLEM, DO YOU?

14:35.368 --> 14:37.170
WELL, REGINE, YOU FAM.

14:37.237 --> 14:41.407
SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT FAIR
FOR YOU TO ASK A QUESTION

14:41.474 --> 14:44.277
LIKE THAT, POINT BLANK
AND EXPECT AN ANSWER.

14:44.344 --> 14:48.782
REGINE, YOU'RE A GOSSIPY,
DIRT DEALING, HUMAN BULLHORN.

14:48.849 --> 14:52.152
WE'RE NOT THAT CLOSE.

14:52.218 --> 14:56.122
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU PEOPLE AGREE
WITH THOSE IDIOTS OUT THERE!

14:56.189 --> 14:59.259
OH, REGINE...
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

14:59.325 --> 15:02.202
YOU CAN'T HELP YOURSELF.

15:02.268 --> 15:04.605
YOU LIKE A BLABAHOLIC.

15:07.107 --> 15:10.176
I HAVE TO GO UPSTAIRS
AND FIND AN OUTFIT

15:10.243 --> 15:13.880
THAT'S APPROPRIATE
FOR BAKING BREAD WITH MONKS.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.883
DON'T FORGET YOUR PUSHUP BRA.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.351
OH, YES, MAX, SURE.

15:18.418 --> 15:22.022
I'M JUST GOING TO STRUT
AROUND A GROUP OF CELIBATE MEN

15:22.088 --> 15:25.258
WHO HAVEN'T SEEN A WOMAN
OF MY CHARMS IN YEARS.

15:31.297 --> 15:33.366
HEY! THIS COULD BE FUN!

15:35.468 --> 15:36.670
NOW, KHADIJAH

15:36.737 --> 15:39.305
THIS IS THE DRESS I WAS
THINKING ABOUT FOR YOU

15:39.372 --> 15:41.908
EXCEPT WITH A DOUBLE
RUFFLE AROUND THE WAIST.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.076
NOT UNLESS IT COMES

15:43.143 --> 15:45.512
WITH A MATCHING BAG
TO PUT OVER MY HEAD!

15:45.579 --> 15:46.913
( doorbell rings )

15:49.816 --> 15:51.117
GOOD EVENING.
I'M LOOKING

15:51.184 --> 15:52.352
FOR SYNCLAIRE JAMES?

15:52.418 --> 15:54.020
WHY, I'M SYNCLAIRE JAMES.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.389
HI. I'M PATRICK O'MALLEY.
I WORK WITH HAROLD.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.625
OH, YES, ALL RIGHT!
COME IN AND SIT DOWN!

15:58.692 --> 16:02.135
I WANTED TO TELL YOU WHAT A
GREAT THING YOU DID FOR HAL

16:02.202 --> 16:04.370
LIFTING UP HIS SPIRITS AND ALL.

16:04.437 --> 16:07.273
OH, THAT'S WHAT
ACTORS HELPING ACTORS

16:07.340 --> 16:08.374
IS ALL ABOUT.

16:08.441 --> 16:10.110
ACTORS HELPING ACTORS.

16:10.176 --> 16:12.312
I WISH THEY HAD A HOT LINE
FOR BRIDESMAIDS

16:12.378 --> 16:13.547
IN BOOTY‐ASS RUFFLES.

16:13.614 --> 16:14.981
WE WASH WINDOWS TOGETHER

16:15.048 --> 16:18.184
AND I HADN'T SEEN HIM IN A WHILE
AND I GOT WORRIED.

16:18.251 --> 16:21.287
THEN THE OTHER DAY, HE SHOWED UP
WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE

16:21.354 --> 16:24.257
AND SAID HE WAS GOING TO
FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE THINGS

16:24.324 --> 16:25.759
IN LIFE... BECAUSE OF YOU.

16:25.826 --> 16:27.260
BECAUSE OF ME?

16:27.327 --> 16:29.896
THEN WE GOT ON THE PLATFORM
AND STARTED OUR WAY

16:29.963 --> 16:31.164
UP TO THE 62nd FLOOR.

16:31.231 --> 16:33.634
HE STARTED TO DANCE FOR JOY
AND HE SHOUTED OUT

16:33.700 --> 16:35.802
"I'VE GOT LIFE,
LIFE DOESN'T HAVE ME!"

16:35.869 --> 16:38.071
HEY, THAT'S ONE
OF YOUR HOT LINE MOTTOS

16:38.138 --> 16:39.472
ISN'T IT, BABE?

16:39.540 --> 16:42.308
REMINDS US THAT WE ARE IN
CHARGE OF OUR OWN DESTINIES.

16:42.375 --> 16:45.178
THEN HE SLIPPED AND FELL
TO HIS DEATH.

16:45.245 --> 16:46.813
WHAT?

16:46.880 --> 16:47.914
ARE YOU SURE?

16:47.981 --> 16:49.783
WELL, THEY TOOK HIM AWAY

16:49.850 --> 16:51.652
IN TWO AMBULANCES, SO...

16:51.718 --> 16:56.456
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE HELL
OF A CHALK OUTLINE.

16:56.523 --> 16:57.524
I'M SORRY, BABY.

16:57.591 --> 16:59.860
I GUESS IT WAS
HAROLD'S TIME.

16:59.926 --> 17:01.668
DON'T BE TOO SAD.

17:01.735 --> 17:04.671
WELL, IT'S FUNNY.
I DO FEEL SAD.

17:04.738 --> 17:07.874
BUT I ALSO FEEL
STRANGELY ELATED.

17:07.941 --> 17:11.612
I MEAN, MAYBE BECAUSE OF ME,
HAROLD IS MEETING HIS MAKER

17:11.678 --> 17:13.880
WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE.

17:13.946 --> 17:15.080
AND TO THINK

17:15.147 --> 17:16.717
WHEN HAROLD TOLD ME ABOUT YOU

17:16.782 --> 17:17.917
I DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM.

17:17.983 --> 17:21.154
YOU AIN'T ALONE, BUDDY.

17:21.221 --> 17:24.691
LISTEN, CAN I CALL YOU
SOMETIME IF I'M FEELING DOWN?

17:24.758 --> 17:27.227
OH, ARE YOU AN
OUT‐OF‐WORK ACTOR TOO?

17:27.292 --> 17:29.896
EXOTIC DANCER.
I KIND OF LET MYSELF GO.

17:29.963 --> 17:31.431
CALL ME!

17:34.601 --> 17:37.470
GOSH! I REALLY FEEL LIKE
I HAVE A PURPOSE, YOU KNOW?

17:37.538 --> 17:39.405
LIKE I'M JUST BURSTING
WITH LIFE.

17:39.472 --> 17:41.474
OH!

17:44.410 --> 17:46.513
OBIE?

17:46.580 --> 17:49.983
WANT TO GO UP
TO YOUR PLACE?

17:50.050 --> 17:53.019
UM, SWEETNESS, A MAN IS DEAD.

17:53.086 --> 17:55.455
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD.

17:56.590 --> 18:00.567
I, UH, SHAVED MY LEGS
THIS MORNING.

18:02.603 --> 18:03.937
LET'S MOSEY.

18:04.004 --> 18:05.371
LET'S GO!

18:05.438 --> 18:07.608
ISN'T LIFE WONDERFUL?

18:13.279 --> 18:16.382
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH THEM?

18:16.449 --> 18:19.252
SOMEBODY DIED.

18:19.319 --> 18:21.387
WELL, THEY HAD A BETTER DAY
THAN I DID.

18:21.454 --> 18:26.960
KHADIJAH, EVEN IN A MONASTERY,
I COULD NOT KEEP MY TRAP SHUT.

18:28.228 --> 18:29.996
I WAS BAKING BREAD
WITH THIS MONK

18:30.063 --> 18:31.932
WHEN I TOLD HIM
HE WAS WAY TOO FINE

18:31.998 --> 18:35.569
TO BE DRESSED
LIKE A SACK OF POTATOES.

18:35.636 --> 18:37.904
NEXT THING I KNOW, I'M OUTSIDE

18:37.971 --> 18:40.306
WITH A SANDAL PRINT
ON MY BEHIND.

18:42.208 --> 18:45.679
YOU MACKED A MONK?

18:45.746 --> 18:49.182
THERE IS A SPECIAL PLACE
IN HELL FOR YOU.

18:50.651 --> 18:53.720
LET'S FACE IT, I'VE BEEN
A BLABBERMOUTH MY WHOLE LIFE.

18:53.787 --> 18:56.790
DID YOU KNOW THAT MY FIRST WORDS
WERE "DA DA"?

18:56.857 --> 18:58.992
NO, NOT BECAUSE I RECOGNIZED HIM

18:59.059 --> 19:03.403
BUT BECAUSE MOMMY WANTED TO KNOW
WHO SPILLED JUICE ON THE CARPET.

19:03.469 --> 19:06.540
THAT'S NOT REALLY
BEING A BLABBERMOUTH.

19:06.607 --> 19:11.211
THAT'S MORE LIKE A TATTLETALE,
STOOL PIGEON, A SNITCH.

19:11.277 --> 19:12.679
A RAT FINK.

19:12.746 --> 19:14.615
THE POINT IS...

19:16.750 --> 19:20.220
THE POINT IS,
I NEVER OUTGREW IT.

19:20.286 --> 19:23.724
AND NOW, UNDERNEATH
ALL MY STYLE AND GRACE

19:23.790 --> 19:26.292
I AM STILL THIS INSECURE
LITTLE GIRL.

19:26.359 --> 19:28.862
IT'S LIKE I NEED TO STILL SAY:

19:28.929 --> 19:30.864
"I KNOW SOMETHING
YOU DON'T KNOW."

19:30.931 --> 19:33.066
JUST TO FEEL IMPORTANT.

19:33.133 --> 19:35.001
THAT'S PATHETIC.

19:38.071 --> 19:41.007
ALL RIGHT, REGINE,
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

19:41.074 --> 19:44.545
SARAH McQUEEN WAS CAUGHT
RED‐HANDED SETTING FIRE

19:44.611 --> 19:45.912
TO A 7‐ELEVEN.

19:45.979 --> 19:47.280
WHAT?
NO!

19:47.347 --> 19:49.115
THE GUY GAVE HER
THE WRONG CHANGE

19:49.182 --> 19:51.885
SO SHE GRABBED THE
"JERRY'S KIDS" DONATION BUCKET

19:51.952 --> 19:53.920
FILLED IT WITH LIGHTER FLUID,
LIT IT

19:53.987 --> 19:55.922
HURLED IT
AT A COMIC BOOK CAROUSEL.

19:55.989 --> 19:59.025
THE PLACE WENT UP LIKE A TORCH.
THERE WERE NO INJURIES.

20:00.293 --> 20:02.703
MRS. BENCHLEY DON'T PLAY!

20:02.769 --> 20:05.171
YEAH, HER HUSBAND
SAID SHE'D BEEN SUFFERING

20:05.238 --> 20:08.108
FROM DEPRESSION EVER SINCE
THEY VOTED ANGELA LANSBURY

20:08.174 --> 20:09.576
"SEXIEST SENIOR CITIZEN."

20:09.643 --> 20:11.845
YOU KNOW, THAT JURY
SHOULD HAVE LISTENED

20:11.912 --> 20:14.214
TO YOU.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.049
OH...

20:16.116 --> 20:17.951
OH, THANK GOD.

20:19.119 --> 20:22.288
I ALMOST THOUGHT
SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH ME!

20:24.791 --> 20:27.794
BUT NOW I KNOW
THAT GOD HAS PUT ME

20:27.861 --> 20:30.831
AND MY BIG MOUTH
HERE FOR A REASON.

20:30.897 --> 20:34.568
TO PISS OFF MONKS?

20:34.635 --> 20:36.469
NO, FOR REAL, KHADIJAH!

20:36.537 --> 20:39.072
SOME PEOPLE
ARE JUST MEANT TO BLAB.

20:39.139 --> 20:43.343
I AM A PURVEYOR OF INFORMATION.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.579
A DIVA OF DISH.

20:47.581 --> 20:53.053
A GABRIEL OF GOSSIP
FOR ALL WHO HEAR MY TRUMPET.

20:54.655 --> 20:57.023
HEY, MAX. YOU KNOW HOW
YOU'VE BEEN SPORTING

20:57.090 --> 20:58.491
THESE PONYTAILS?

20:58.559 --> 21:00.260
WELL, YOUR GIRL
KHADIJAH SAID

21:00.326 --> 21:02.268
ALL YOU NEEDED
WAS SOME FRECKLES

21:02.335 --> 21:05.639
AND YOU'D LOOK LIKE
AN URBAN PIPPI LONGSTOCKING.

21:09.275 --> 21:11.044
KHADIJAH, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

21:11.111 --> 21:12.045
UH, UH, UH.

21:12.112 --> 21:13.880
NOW, BEFORE YOU GET TOO UPSET

21:13.947 --> 21:17.618
REMEMBER, THE OTHER DAY, YOU
SAID KHADIJAH'S LATEST HAIRDO

21:17.684 --> 21:20.053
LOOKED LIKE
<i>ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN.</i>

21:23.123 --> 21:24.725
UM, EXCUSE ME.

21:24.791 --> 21:27.127
WHY ARE YOU SPILLING
ALL OF THIS DIRT?

21:29.295 --> 21:31.297
IT'S WHAT I DO.

21:40.807 --> 21:44.778
