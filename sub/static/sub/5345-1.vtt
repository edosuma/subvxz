Would you mind telling me
what the hell is going on?

52:00.880 --> 52:04.340
Detective John Shaw.
He's had a few problems.

52:04.440 --> 52:05.820
Meaning?

52:05.920 --> 52:08.020
Shaw was shot in the line of duty
seven months ago,

52:08.120 --> 52:11.283
along with his rookie partner,
Ray Jones, who lost his life.

52:11.720 --> 52:13.961
A lot of cops around here
blamed him for his death.

52:14.560 --> 52:16.300
They still do.

52:16.400 --> 52:20.242
Shaw was suffering from post-traumatic
stress and assigned a station psychiatrist.

52:20.440 --> 52:21.500
Made excellent progress.

52:21.600 --> 52:24.251
Enough that, last week,
he was signed off and given the all-clear.

52:25.720 --> 52:27.563

was inaccurate.

52:55.960 --> 52:57.530
He gunned down Meeks in cold blood.

We gave him the opportunity
to surrender,

52:59.920 --> 53:02.127

he's willing to do.

He's since killed another three cops
and a rookie, Officer Taylor.

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:09.684
Hand me the flash drive.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.690
I can't do that.

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.520
Then I'm afraid you're of no use to me.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.580
I know you still have it on you.

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:26.251
You are nothing if not predictable.

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:31.046
I'm willing to bet
it's in your back left pocket.

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:35.820
Now, hand it over.

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:38.241
Or I'll shoot you in the head
and take it anyway.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.980
You know my favorite part of training?

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.605
It's combat exercises.

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.929
(COUGHING)

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:23.851
You call that a punch?

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.488
That was just my good cop.

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:29.380
Wait till you see my bad cop.

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:30.527
(GROANS)

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:38.245
This is what you get
for fucking with me!

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:49.809
You're gonna die,
just like Ray Jones did.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.020
You never should have come back, Shaw.

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:56.647
You never had what it took for the job
even before you lost it.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.411
Hand me his gun.

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:18.580
SWAT LEADER: All set to breach, sir.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:21.411
Okay, SWAT's in position.
Prepare to kill the power.

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:24.250
Any last words?

01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:30.721
Yeah.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.002
Is "asshole" one word or two?

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.807
'Cause I don't want to spell it wrong
on your Christmas card.

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:40.331
(LAUGHING)

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:43.451
That is a funny man!

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:48.580
I'm gonna savor the moment

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:50.125
when your head pops.

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.050
Saved two rounds for yourself?

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.969
Actually, I saved one for him,
and I saved the last for you.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.366
(GROANS)

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.940
Power's cut, move in.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.201
Move, move, move!

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.525
(BOTH GROANING)

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.924
SWAT LEADER: Watch the right!

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:52.300
Clear!

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.765
Flank at right.

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:04.241
Last round.

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.563
- SWAT LEADER: Floor one clear. Moving up!
- Shit!

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.126
- Contact!
- Visual!

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:16.164
Move, move, move, move, move!

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.761
(RAPID GUNFIRE)

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:37.801
On your six!

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.286
Moving left!

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:45.402
Move, gentlemen! Eyes open!

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:02.900
(CELL PHONE VIBRATES)

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.001
Matthews?

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.488
They cut the power.
Signal jammer's down.

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.780
Listen, I haven't got long.

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.940
Burke destroyed the evidence.
I'm out of options.

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.740
All right? You gotta call the SWAT off.

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.922
I can't. It's Keppler's call.

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.044
You're my only option.

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.641
All right?
Or all this has been for nothing.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:27.367
Okay. Can you meet me at the rear
of the building in the drill hall?

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:29.441
I'll try.

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:31.005
Not good enough, Shaw.

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:33.285
Yeah, I can make it.

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:35.045
Be there in 10 minutes.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.566
Right.

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:45.291
This floor is clear.

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.206
Got you covered.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.140
Oh, thank God. You made it.

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:28.846
- Just about.
- I've got a car waiting out back. Come on.

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:41.927
Lose the gun.

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:44.725
Matthews?

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.809
I said, lose the gun.

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.081
Burke?

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.365
You're working with Burke?

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:02.380
Come on.

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.404
Who do you think cleans up
messes like tonight, huh?

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:08.340
The only good thing about tonight

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:11.125
is that you presented me
with the ideal opportunity

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:14.088
to cut Matthews out of our operation.

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:15.447
(GRUNTS)

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:19.127
Don't even think about it.

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:29.010
I was never the type
to share my toys as a kid.

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:34.406
I told you I'd never let you
walk out of here.

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.564
This is my show.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:39.660
It's taken a long time to build
what I've built.

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:45.210
And neither you or George Freemont
or anyone else will stand in my way.

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:48.325
Enjoy retirement.

01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.060
SWAT LEADER: Hands where we can see 'em!

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:52.650
Hands up! Move, move, move!

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.687
- Detective Burke!
- OFFICER: Stay where you are!

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:03.811
This son of a bitch
just shot Captain Matthews.

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:13.460
KEPPLER: All right, we've got him.

01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:15.050
It's over.

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.420
Arrest this piece of shit.

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:18.521
Wait!

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:22.366
Wait.

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:26.362
Everything you need to know
is right here.

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:30.900
BURKE: I told you
I'd never let you walk out of here.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.889
This is my show.

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:36.060
It's taken a long time to build
what I've built.

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:40.688
And neither you or George Freemont
or anyone else will stand in my way.

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:43.964
Enjoy retirement.

01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:58.361
(YELLS)

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:03.486
(GROANS)

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:08.490
- I'm out.
- (CLICKS)

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:29.607
Looks like I kicked ass
on my first day back after all.
