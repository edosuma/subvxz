20:28.123 --> 20:31.039
Except for her gross dead guinea pigs.

20:32.653 --> 20:34.531
Lily was cool.

20:34.556 --> 20:37.176
She used to let me use her makeup.

20:37.201 --> 20:38.664
And... [LAUGHS]

20:38.689 --> 20:41.131
And sometimes we would
go behind her house

20:41.156 --> 20:44.448
and smoke, like,
these really skinny cigarettes.

20:44.473 --> 20:46.215
Oh, yeah. Capri Slims.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.964
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

20:47.989 --> 20:50.403
Okay, now scoot over to the other side.

20:53.067 --> 20:55.932
We talked about leaving
when we turned 18.

20:55.957 --> 20:57.740
Moving in together.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.590
I had started collecting
plates and kitchen stuff...

21:01.615 --> 21:02.948
MAN: Zohara!

21:02.973 --> 21:05.809
Are you here? Zohara!

21:08.198 --> 21:09.473
Dad?

21:12.989 --> 21:15.406
- Who's this?
- This is Maria.

21:15.545 --> 21:17.336
She's been helping me.

21:17.684 --> 21:20.957
[PANTING]

21:20.982 --> 21:22.910
I'm sorry. I just wanted to check

21:22.935 --> 21:25.144
and make sure that Lily was okay..

21:25.169 --> 21:27.336
- We need to go.
- No, wait...

21:27.361 --> 21:29.278
- Now. Come on!
- Maria!

21:29.303 --> 21:32.777
- [ALL SHOUTING]
- [ZOHARA SCREAMS]

21:32.802 --> 21:36.557
Wait! Wait, wait! Stop!

21:36.582 --> 21:40.006
[SHOUTING, GRUNTING]

21:40.031 --> 21:43.981
- [ZOHARA WHIMPERING]
- [MAN GURGLING]

21:44.006 --> 21:47.067
[MARIA GROANING]

21:50.637 --> 21:52.668
Maria! No...

21:55.110 --> 21:58.653
FATHER: It was an accident.
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

22:00.466 --> 22:02.216
[WHEEZING]

22:03.387 --> 22:05.531
She's pregnant. We have to help her.

22:05.556 --> 22:08.048
[PANTING]

22:08.073 --> 22:12.121
Once she breaks her leg,
we can't make her suffer.

22:13.101 --> 22:14.496
Dad?

22:15.621 --> 22:17.632
We can't leave her like this, son.

22:17.657 --> 22:19.020
No, Dad, it's me!

22:19.045 --> 22:21.817
- We can't leave her like this.
- Stop! Listen.

22:21.842 --> 22:23.684
We can take her back
to the shelter, Dad.

22:23.709 --> 22:25.371
We have to do it.

22:26.316 --> 22:27.429
I'm sorry.

22:27.454 --> 22:29.965
- It will be quick.
- Dad. Don't do this!

22:29.990 --> 22:31.301
We have to do it.

22:32.115 --> 22:33.715
I promise it won't hurt.

22:33.740 --> 22:35.182
[WHEEZING]

22:35.207 --> 22:36.731
This won't hu...

22:40.673 --> 22:43.034
Maria. Maria!

22:43.059 --> 22:44.948
[WHEEZING]

22:44.973 --> 22:46.348
Maria.

22:48.073 --> 22:51.215
- [MARIA EXHALES]
- ZOHARA: Maria...

23:03.957 --> 23:10.957
_

23:23.189 --> 23:25.528
ZOHARA [VOICE ECHOING]: Maria...

23:48.387 --> 23:50.942
But I can feel there's power in it.

23:51.713 --> 23:54.723
MARIA: And he has this mark on his body.

24:24.781 --> 24:26.973
[CRYING]

24:26.998 --> 24:28.442
No.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.300
Maria...
