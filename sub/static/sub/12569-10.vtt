00:03.462 --> 00:04.902
Jessie! I can't use

00:04.903 --> 00:06.340
the new play area.

00:06.382 --> 00:08.300
- They're making
- a movie over there.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.969
- So use the play structure
- behind us.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.889
Been there, climbed that.

00:12.931 --> 00:14.766
- Well, I brought a book
- you could read...

00:14.807 --> 00:15.850
No!

00:17.936 --> 00:20.563
Too easy.

00:20.605 --> 00:22.461
I hear it's a big

00:22.462 --> 00:24.316
budget action movie,

00:20.605 --> 00:24.316
Tomb Robbers: Mayan Mayhem.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.110
Why didn't you audition?

00:26.151 --> 00:27.880
- Because I prefer to
- make my feature debut

00:27.904 --> 00:29.256
- In an independent,
- character-driven film,

00:29.280 --> 00:30.281
Where I can really

00:30.282 --> 00:31.282
explore my craft.

00:31.323 --> 00:32.408
So, you auditioned

00:32.409 --> 00:33.492
and didn't get it?

00:33.534 --> 00:34.534
Bingo.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.556
- Well, I'm going to
- go check it out.

00:37.580 --> 00:39.457

- Well, when you're - raised in the outback
- With eight brothers,

02:36.866 --> 02:38.784

- Huh.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.119
And stand upwind.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.205
Ugh.

- Not as much as
- I love my fans.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.761
I'm sorry, little sprog.

03:17.762 --> 03:19.491
I don't know

03:16.030 --> 03:19.491
my own strength.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.534
You don't sound

03:20.535 --> 03:21.535
like you do

03:19.533 --> 03:21.535
in your movies.

03:21.577 --> 03:22.683
Oh, that's 'cause when

03:22.684 --> 03:23.788
I play Professor Pepper,

03:23.829 --> 03:26.165
I use an American accent.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.927
- I'll take curly fries
- with that, please.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.087
That was brilliant!

03:31.129 --> 03:32.943
I remember how hard

03:32.944 --> 03:34.757
it was to master

03:31.129 --> 03:34.757
my perfect American accent.

03:37.301 --> 03:38.427
What?

03:38.469 --> 03:39.469
ALL: Nothing.

03:41.055 --> 03:42.578
You know, Shaylee,

03:42.579 --> 03:44.100
we have a lot in common.

03:44.142 --> 03:45.744
- My best friend, Kenny,
- is from Australia.

03:45.768 --> 03:47.478
Really? What part?

03:47.519 --> 03:49.104
Well, technically,

03:49.105 --> 03:50.689
he was made in China.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.462
He's a stuffed animal.

03:52.463 --> 03:54.193
But he'll still be the

03:50.731 --> 03:54.193
best man at our wedding.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.861
(CHUCKLES)

03:55.903 --> 03:57.613
Luke, heel!

03:57.655 --> 03:58.924
- Sorry, you'll have
- to excuse him.

03:58.948 --> 04:00.199
Raging boy-mones.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.742
(CHUCKLES)

04:02.785 --> 04:04.203
- Jessie.
- Hmm?

04:04.244 --> 04:06.205
- Tell Shaylee you want
- to be in her movie.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.477
Emma, I can't ask

04:07.478 --> 04:08.707
a total stranger for

04:06.246 --> 04:08.707
a part in their movie.

04:10.084 --> 04:11.669
- By the way,
- my name is Jessie.

04:11.710 --> 04:14.031
- Now that we're buds, - can I have a part
- In your movie?

04:14.172 --> 04:16.923
Sorry, we're all cast.

04:16.966 --> 04:18.802
Although,

04:18.803 --> 04:20.636
I do need a new

04:16.966 --> 04:20.636
stunt woman.

04:20.678 --> 04:22.805
Did the last one quit?

04:22.847 --> 04:25.117
- Well, that's what she muttered - as
they loaded her - Into the ambulance.

04:25.141 --> 04:25.599
Well, most of her.

04:25.641 --> 04:28.435
Oh.

04:28.477 --> 04:29.917
Huh, well, you know,

04:29.918 --> 04:31.355
I have tons of

04:28.477 --> 04:31.355
stunt experience.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.677
- No, you...
- Here you go, Luke!

04:34.358 --> 04:36.194
I thought you might.

04:36.235 --> 04:37.737
Your fall from

04:37.738 --> 04:39.238
that play structure

04:36.235 --> 04:39.238
was very impressive.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.552
And look how fast your

04:40.553 --> 04:41.824
wounds scabbed over.

04:41.866 --> 04:43.701
- Well, yeah, I do have
- a gift for clotting.

04:43.742 --> 04:44.765
Everyone in my family

04:44.766 --> 04:45.786
is very clotty.

04:45.828 --> 04:47.579
- Well, then you've
- got the job.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.016
- I'll send someone over - to get your info.
- Right.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.249
See you on set.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.834
Right. Got it. On set.

04:51.835 --> 04:53.377
(CHUCKLES)

04:53.418 --> 04:54.629
(SCREAMS)

04:54.630 --> 04:55.838
I'm going to be on set!

04:55.880 --> 04:57.524
- Jessie, are you crazy?
- You're not a stunt woman.

04:57.548 --> 04:59.133
I wasn't a nanny either,

04:59.134 --> 05:00.718
but that didn't stop me.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.325
JESSIE:

05:03.326 --> 05:04.555
I love going to the zoo.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.245
Jessie,

05:06.246 --> 05:07.892
it is wonderful Shaylee

05:04.596 --> 05:07.892
got you in the movie.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.577
- But while you are
- living out your dream

05:09.601 --> 05:10.728
By falling off

05:10.729 --> 05:11.854
of tall objects,

05:11.896 --> 05:13.480
- who will be
- looking after us?

05:13.522 --> 05:15.000
- Oh, Bertram. - Yeah, he didn't
- Want to do it,

05:15.024 --> 05:16.505
But I know

05:16.506 --> 05:17.985
about this nerve

05:15.024 --> 05:17.985
on the neck.

05:18.027 --> 05:19.046
- It's amazing
- what people will agree to

05:19.070 --> 05:20.489
If you squeeze it

05:20.490 --> 05:21.906
just right.

05:25.743 --> 05:27.203
Zuri, why so sad?

05:27.245 --> 05:28.287
Didn't you have fun seeing

05:28.288 --> 05:29.329
Zeebee at the zoo?

05:29.371 --> 05:31.832
No! Poor Zeebee,

05:31.833 --> 05:34.293
he's a prisoner

05:29.371 --> 05:34.293
in that place.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.962
Stuck behind bars,

05:35.963 --> 05:37.588
wearing stripes.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.591
Uh, he is a zebra.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.969
Zebras are people too.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.639
And he looked so lonely.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.265
It's not fair.

05:47.306 --> 05:49.163
Ravi and his pet

05:49.164 --> 05:51.018
are together every second

05:47.306 --> 05:51.018
of every day.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.542
Yes, and frankly,

05:53.543 --> 05:54.730
it's a little creepy.

05:59.777 --> 06:02.446
Hey, Shaylee.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.073
Jessie! Welcome.

06:04.115 --> 06:05.137
Thanks again for

06:05.138 --> 06:06.158
getting me this job.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.036
Wow, this set is amazing.

06:08.037 --> 06:09.870
These rocks look so real.

06:10.454 --> 06:11.330
Ow!

06:11.371 --> 06:13.916
That's because they are.

06:13.958 --> 06:15.251
Huh, I'm surprised

06:15.252 --> 06:16.543
they didn't teach you that

06:13.958 --> 06:16.543
at stunt school.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.045
They did. I got

06:18.046 --> 06:19.504
a C-minus in rocks.

06:22.091 --> 06:23.342
Luke?

06:23.383 --> 06:24.823
Whoa! I'm seeing double,

06:24.824 --> 06:26.262
and I like it.

06:28.306 --> 06:29.348
You have 10 seconds

06:29.349 --> 06:30.390
to explain why

06:28.306 --> 06:30.390
you're not in school,

06:30.432 --> 06:32.119
- or else you're going
- to need a stunt double.

06:32.143 --> 06:33.436
Well, Dad called

06:33.437 --> 06:34.728
the director, McD,

06:34.770 --> 06:35.813
and got permission for me

06:35.814 --> 06:36.855
to do a behind-the scenes

06:34.770 --> 06:36.855
documentary

06:36.897 --> 06:38.732
for my film class.

06:38.774 --> 06:39.793
- So, I get to - follow you around
- With a camera.

06:39.817 --> 06:41.360
- But this time,
- not in a creepy,

06:41.401 --> 06:43.363
Without-your-knowledge

06:43.364 --> 06:45.323
kind of way, so...

06:45.364 --> 06:46.762
It might be less creepy

06:46.763 --> 06:48.159
if you weren't drooling

06:45.364 --> 06:48.159
so much.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.321
- And if you had - that camera pointed
- At our faces.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.769
No. I asked for

06:54.770 --> 06:56.583
a Choco-Doodle.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.710
This is a Choco-Buddy.

06:58.752 --> 06:59.796
Do you know

06:59.797 --> 07:00.838
who my father is?

07:00.879 --> 07:01.923
He's the head

07:01.924 --> 07:02.965
of the studio.

07:03.007 --> 07:04.154
And, uh, do you know

07:04.155 --> 07:05.301
why he gave me

07:03.007 --> 07:05.301
this directing job?

07:05.343 --> 07:07.199
Because I know how

07:07.200 --> 07:09.054
to get what I want. So...

07:09.096 --> 07:10.452
Ooh, and,

07:10.453 --> 07:11.807
it was a belated

07:09.096 --> 07:11.807
Bar Mitzvah gift.

07:11.849 --> 07:13.267
L'chaim.

07:13.309 --> 07:14.476
Where's my stunt woman?

07:14.518 --> 07:15.540
Hi, hi, McD!

07:15.541 --> 07:16.561
I'm right here.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.872
- So, how do you want me
- to play this scene?

07:17.896 --> 07:19.086
Excited, scared?

07:19.087 --> 07:20.274
Excitedly-scared?

07:20.316 --> 07:21.650
- I want you standing
- on this X.

07:21.692 --> 07:23.861
(BELL RINGS)

07:23.902 --> 07:25.904
Got it. On the X.

07:25.946 --> 07:26.989
Excitedly-scared.

07:28.532 --> 07:30.201
And... Action!

07:36.123 --> 07:37.624
- Cut!
- (BELL RINGS)

07:37.666 --> 07:39.751
(GROANING)

07:39.793 --> 07:40.895
- Okay, that was
- a great rehearsal.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.087
Now let's do it for real.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.009
- That felt
- pretty real to me.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.681
Giddy-up!

07:56.227 --> 07:57.602
And now it's a rug.

07:59.021 --> 08:00.669
I miss Zeebee.

08:00.670 --> 08:02.316
I wish he could come home.

08:02.358 --> 08:04.194
We can't have

08:04.195 --> 08:06.028
a big, smelly animal

08:02.358 --> 08:06.028
in an apartment.

08:06.070 --> 08:07.821
But we have Bertram!

08:08.655 --> 08:10.657
Good point.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.618
I'm gonna call Mom and Dad

08:12.619 --> 08:14.536
and ask if they can

08:10.699 --> 08:14.536
get Zeebee back.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.893
Zuri, Mom and Dad are

08:16.894 --> 08:19.208
never going to let you

08:14.578 --> 08:19.208
have a zebra in the house.

08:19.250 --> 08:21.252
But maybe we can do it

08:21.253 --> 08:23.254
without asking permission.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.130
- I love
- not asking permission.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.528
Almost as much as I love

08:26.529 --> 08:27.883
not brushing my teeth.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.697
- Yeah. We've got to
- talk about that.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.078
Are you sure

08:37.080 --> 08:38.643
you're Christina Ross?

08:40.062 --> 08:42.356
You look like a kid.

08:42.398 --> 08:44.107
Oh, you're too kind.

08:44.109 --> 08:45.817
And you don't look

08:42.398 --> 08:45.817
a day over 40.

08:46.568 --> 08:47.568
I'm 27.

08:49.447 --> 08:50.447
Yikes!

08:53.951 --> 08:55.640
Anyway,

08:55.641 --> 08:57.329
we'll take Zeebee now.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.352
It is highly irregular for

08:59.353 --> 09:01.333
donors to ask to borrow

08:57.371 --> 09:01.333
their animals.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.252
- It's not like
- this is a lending library.

09:03.294 --> 09:04.336
(LAUGHS)

09:04.378 --> 09:06.671
(SNORTS)

09:06.713 --> 09:08.132
Yes, understood.

09:08.133 --> 09:09.549
We're just asking

09:06.713 --> 09:09.549
to get our zebra,

09:09.591 --> 09:11.510
which is housed

09:11.511 --> 09:13.429
in the Ross Family

09:09.591 --> 09:13.429
Wild Animal Pavilion.

09:13.471 --> 09:15.640
Which is located

09:15.641 --> 09:17.808
in the Ross Family

09:13.471 --> 09:17.808
African Adventure Wing.

09:17.849 --> 09:19.226
- I don't know.
- It just...

09:19.268 --> 09:20.875
BTW, what does it say

09:20.876 --> 09:22.480
on your paycheck?

09:22.521 --> 09:23.564
The Ross Family Founda...

09:23.565 --> 09:24.606
Ooh.

09:26.650 --> 09:27.797
Would you like

09:27.798 --> 09:28.944
Zeebee washed first?

09:28.986 --> 09:30.550
We can make him smell

09:30.551 --> 09:32.114
like the rainforest,

09:28.986 --> 09:32.114
or a new car.

09:40.664 --> 09:42.479
Good on you, Jessie!

09:42.480 --> 09:44.293
You rocked it!

09:44.335 --> 09:46.524
(GRUNTING) Literally,

09:46.525 --> 09:48.713
'cause I just caught

09:44.335 --> 09:48.713
a boulder with my face.

09:48.755 --> 09:49.986
On the bright side,

09:49.987 --> 09:51.216
it really brings out

09:48.755 --> 09:51.216
the red in your cheeks.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.676
That's blood.

09:53.969 --> 09:54.969
Well, you make it work!

09:56.096 --> 09:57.473
(CHUCKLES) Thanks.

09:57.515 --> 09:59.057
- You know,
- for a big movie star,

09:59.099 --> 10:00.559
- You're really
- easy to talk to.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.060
Oh, thanks.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.499
(SIGHS) I try, but, um,

10:03.500 --> 10:04.896
it's not always easy

10:04.938 --> 10:06.565
- to make friends
- in this business.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.941
You never know

10:07.942 --> 10:09.276
who you can trust.

10:09.318 --> 10:09.776
- Well, you know, I was - voted "Most
Trustworthy" - In my high school class.

10:09.818 --> 10:12.154
Hmm.

10:12.196 --> 10:14.198
- Also "Most Likely to Marry
- a Rodeo Clown,"

10:14.239 --> 10:15.407
Which I don't tell

10:15.408 --> 10:16.575
very many people.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.337
- It's a good policy.
- Probably. (CHUCKLES)

10:20.371 --> 10:21.810
You know, I'm so used

10:21.811 --> 10:23.248
to being around adults

10:20.371 --> 10:23.248
on set,

10:23.290 --> 10:24.667
it's really nice to

10:24.668 --> 10:26.043
have a girl my own age

10:23.290 --> 10:26.043
to talk to.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.232
And it's really nice

10:27.233 --> 10:28.379
for me to talk to a girl

10:28.420 --> 10:29.464
without ending

10:29.465 --> 10:30.506
every sentence in,

10:28.420 --> 10:30.506
"Because I said so."

10:30.548 --> 10:32.757
(CHUCKLES)

10:32.799 --> 10:33.758
- Hey, you want to - come hang out
- At my place later?

10:33.800 --> 10:36.094
(GASPS) I would love to.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.822
- Ooh! Can we do that
- thing where one girl goes

10:37.846 --> 10:39.014
To sleep over

10:39.015 --> 10:40.182
at another girl's house?

10:40.224 --> 10:41.475
What do you call that?

10:41.517 --> 10:42.893
- A sleepover?
- Yes.

10:42.934 --> 10:44.228
- Yes. (CHUCKLING)
- Brilliant!

10:44.269 --> 10:45.458
I've never had

10:45.459 --> 10:46.646
one of those.

10:46.688 --> 10:47.752
Well, what about

10:47.753 --> 10:48.815
your first movie,

10:46.688 --> 10:48.815
Past Your Dead Time?

10:48.857 --> 10:50.714
Doesn't count. I got eaten

10:50.715 --> 10:52.570
by a werewolf before

10:48.857 --> 10:52.570
the first pillow fight.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.843
Hmm. Well, the only hairy,

10:54.844 --> 10:57.074
scary thing you'll encounter

10:52.611 --> 10:57.074
at our penthouse

10:57.115 --> 10:58.396
- is our butler
- Bertram's back.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.329
Shaylee,

11:02.330 --> 11:03.914
you were so brilliant

11:03.955 --> 11:05.350
- when those boulders
- fell on you.

11:05.374 --> 11:08.085
I really felt your pain.

11:08.126 --> 11:09.711
- Yeah, actually,
- that was my pain.

11:11.213 --> 11:12.756
That's what makes her

11:12.757 --> 11:14.299
such a great actress.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.134
- The way that
- she used your pain.

11:17.428 --> 11:19.054
- (SIGHS)
- I adore you.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.224
(KISSES)

11:22.266 --> 11:23.642
(CHUCKLES)

11:23.683 --> 11:24.684
(SMACKING LIPS)

11:24.685 --> 11:25.685
You even taste amazing.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.062
Oh, that's chocolate.

11:27.063 --> 11:28.397
I ate the last

11:25.727 --> 11:28.397
Choco-Doodle.

11:28.439 --> 11:30.128
Mmm,

11:30.129 --> 11:31.816
which you so deserve!

11:33.569 --> 11:35.779
(SIGHS) Because you are

11:35.780 --> 11:37.989
a bright and shining star.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.638
(CHUCKLES)

11:39.639 --> 11:41.243
(SCOFFS)

11:41.285 --> 11:42.453
That McD is

11:42.454 --> 11:43.621
a giant tool.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.018
He's my boyfriend.

11:45.019 --> 11:46.373
Uh, which is American

11:43.662 --> 11:46.373
for "talent!"

11:49.627 --> 11:51.253
Zeebee, would you

11:51.254 --> 11:52.879
like some tea?

11:52.921 --> 11:54.673
No! Considering what

11:54.674 --> 11:56.425
I just mopped up,

11:52.921 --> 11:56.425
no more liquids.

11:59.094 --> 12:00.887
Is that Zeebee?

12:00.929 --> 12:02.598
Uh, no.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.142
(NEIGHING SOFTLY)

12:05.183 --> 12:06.977
(SMACKING LIPS)

12:07.018 --> 12:08.500
Please, sister.

12:08.501 --> 12:09.980
How dumb do

12:07.018 --> 12:09.980
you think I am?

12:10.021 --> 12:11.920
Well, on a scale from

12:11.921 --> 12:13.817
Luke to Einstein...

12:13.858 --> 12:14.964
I think you should

12:14.965 --> 12:16.069
check yourself,

12:16.111 --> 12:17.711
- before you proceed
- to wreck yourself.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.327
(SNIFFLING)

12:24.286 --> 12:25.621
(SIGHS)

12:25.663 --> 12:27.165
That movie was so sad.

12:27.166 --> 12:28.666
(GRUNTS)

12:28.707 --> 12:30.584
- But at least
- Channing Tatum's soul

12:30.626 --> 12:32.226
- Will live on in
- Blake Lively's puppy.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.380
Every time she says "Fetch,"

12:35.381 --> 12:36.965
he'll bring her his heart.

12:37.007 --> 12:38.133

(BLOWING NOSES)

12:39.801 --> 12:42.179

12:42.220 --> 12:43.888
- This is really fun.
- Yeah.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.184
- I'm so busy
- being in movies,

12:47.225 --> 12:48.310
I never get to just sit

12:48.311 --> 12:49.394
and watch one with a mate.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.625
(CHUCKLES) Whereas

12:50.626 --> 12:51.813
I'm so busy sitting

12:49.436 --> 12:51.813
around watching them,

12:51.855 --> 12:53.166
- I never have time
- to be in one.

12:53.190 --> 12:54.650
(CHUCKLES)

12:54.692 --> 12:56.127
- So, how long
- have you been acting?

12:56.151 --> 12:57.253
- Since I was knee-high
- to a wallaby.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.445
Which isn't

12:58.446 --> 12:59.613
the best place to be.

12:59.655 --> 13:00.905
- They're kickers.
- Noted.

13:03.575 --> 13:04.660
You know, you have

13:04.661 --> 13:05.744
had my dream life.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.849
You know, it hasn't all

13:06.850 --> 13:07.912
been dreamy.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.227
Ever played peek-a-boo

13:09.228 --> 13:10.499
with Christopher Walken?

13:10.541 --> 13:13.210
It's creepy.

13:13.251 --> 13:15.172
- Anything with - Christopher Walken
- Is creepy.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.384
You know, Jessie,

13:20.385 --> 13:22.511
I'm really impressed with

13:18.256 --> 13:22.511
how you handle your stunts.

13:22.553 --> 13:23.805
You're pretty tough

13:23.806 --> 13:25.055
for a city gal.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.494
Actually, I was raised

13:26.495 --> 13:27.891
on a military base,

13:25.096 --> 13:27.891
which is no picnic.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.290
Well, except for, of course,

13:30.291 --> 13:32.646
the annual Officer's Picnic.

13:32.688 --> 13:34.128
See this scar?

13:34.129 --> 13:35.566
Got it crawling

13:32.688 --> 13:35.566
through barbed wire.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.192
- Obstacle course?
- No, nope.

13:37.234 --> 13:38.378
- Sneaking out
- my bedroom window.

13:38.402 --> 13:39.778
Strict dad.

13:39.819 --> 13:40.838
- I got that beat.
- (GRUNTS)

13:40.862 --> 13:43.699
See this scar?

13:43.741 --> 13:45.033
Croc bite.

13:45.075 --> 13:46.577
- Whoa!
- That's pretty gnarly.

13:46.618 --> 13:47.703
Yeah, you should have seen

13:47.704 --> 13:48.787
the one I gave him.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.247
(CHUCKLES)

13:50.288 --> 13:51.561
Well, I will toast

13:51.562 --> 13:52.832
to your croc bite.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.064
Aw. And I will toast

13:54.065 --> 13:55.252
to your barbed wire scar.

13:55.293 --> 13:56.294
(CHUCKLES)

13:58.213 --> 13:59.444
So... On to

13:59.445 --> 14:00.674
emotional scars.

13:58.213 --> 14:00.674
Hmm.

14:00.716 --> 14:01.716
Let's talk about guys.

14:02.926 --> 14:03.927
How long have you and McD

14:03.928 --> 14:04.928
been an item?

14:04.969 --> 14:06.638
Almost a year.

14:06.680 --> 14:07.681
I'm so lucky that

14:07.682 --> 14:08.682
we found each other.

14:08.724 --> 14:09.784
- I don't know what
- I'd do without him.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.810
Isn't he a genius?

14:11.851 --> 14:12.915
Well, that is what

14:12.916 --> 14:13.978
he put on the back of

14:11.851 --> 14:13.978
his director's chair.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.022
(CHUCKLES)

14:16.064 --> 14:18.000
- What about you? - Is there a special guy
- In your life?

14:18.024 --> 14:19.276
Oh, two, actually.

14:19.277 --> 14:20.527
Yeah, my boyfriend, Tony,

14:20.569 --> 14:21.862
and the freckled one,

14:21.863 --> 14:23.154
that's currently taping us

14:20.569 --> 14:23.154
from behind that chair.

14:27.785 --> 14:28.868
Hello.

14:30.621 --> 14:33.164
Hey, don't mind me.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.750
But if you guys want

14:34.751 --> 14:36.293
to break out into

14:33.206 --> 14:36.293
an impromptu pillow fight,

14:36.334 --> 14:37.399
I, uh, put some

14:37.400 --> 14:38.462
on your chairs.

14:39.504 --> 14:41.673
Hey!

14:41.715 --> 14:42.716
Whoa!

14:43.967 --> 14:45.176
(THUD)

14:45.218 --> 14:45.927
Nice shot!

14:45.969 --> 14:47.887
Wait for it.

14:47.929 --> 14:48.929
(PILLOW WHOOSHING)

14:50.932 --> 14:52.038
You have got to teach me

14:52.039 --> 14:53.143
how to do that.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.523

23:52.182 --> 23:53.766
- We begged her
- to use sunblock.

23:55.226 --> 23:56.603
Do you have

23:56.604 --> 23:57.979
the paperwork

23:55.226 --> 23:57.979
to own this animal?

23:58.021 --> 23:59.397
I don't own it.

23:59.398 --> 24:00.773
I just despise it.

24:00.815 --> 24:02.626
- Because if you don't have
- the proper paperwork,

24:02.650 --> 24:03.881
I'll have to

24:03.882 --> 24:05.111
confiscate this lizard.

24:05.153 --> 24:06.487
(ALL GASP)

24:06.529 --> 24:07.947
It's the law.

24:07.989 --> 24:10.158
No! You can't!

24:10.200 --> 24:11.514
For some reason,

24:11.515 --> 24:12.827
the owner is really

24:10.200 --> 24:12.827
attached to it.

24:14.287 --> 24:15.830
- Maybe we can
- work something out?

24:15.872 --> 24:17.516
- Would you take our
- brother Luke instead?

24:17.540 --> 24:18.604
He's a really

24:18.605 --> 24:19.667
good dancer.

24:19.709 --> 24:21.628
No can do.

24:21.629 --> 24:23.546
We already have

24:19.709 --> 24:23.546
two dancing bears,

24:23.587 --> 24:25.256
and they are divas.

24:27.008 --> 24:27.842
McD!

24:27.884 --> 24:30.469
You're go for McD!

24:30.511 --> 24:31.888
Hi.

24:31.889 --> 24:33.264
I have a few questions about

24:30.511 --> 24:33.264
my receptionist character.

24:33.306 --> 24:35.225
Does she ever get a case

24:35.226 --> 24:37.143
of the Mondays?

24:37.185 --> 24:38.832
Or, or, or maybe she's

24:38.833 --> 24:40.479
just doing it until her

24:37.185 --> 24:40.479
music career kicks off?

24:40.521 --> 24:42.148
FYI, I sing a little.

24:43.316 --> 24:45.235
- Uh, you know what,
- Jessie?

24:45.276 --> 24:46.903
Um, how about we work

24:46.904 --> 24:48.529
on the scene tonight?

24:45.276 --> 24:48.529
Over dinner.

24:48.571 --> 24:49.697
Oh, sounds great.

24:49.698 --> 24:50.823
I would love to have dinner

24:48.571 --> 24:50.823
with you and Shaylee.

24:50.865 --> 24:53.284
(CHUCKLES)

24:53.326 --> 24:54.727
- Who said anything
- about Shaylee?

24:55.619 --> 24:56.619
I'll see you tonight.

24:58.915 --> 25:01.235
- Suddenly, - I have a few questions
- About his character.
