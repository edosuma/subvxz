(  mellow theme playing  )

00:06.208 --> 00:09.500
KADE ( sighing ):

00:06.208 --> 00:09.500
Bored.

00:09.542 --> 00:10.750
Boredom.

00:10.792 --> 00:12.750
Boring.

00:10.792 --> 00:12.750
Ooh, I know.

00:12.792 --> 00:15.000
We fill up your tanks

00:12.792 --> 00:15.000
with shellac.

00:15.041 --> 00:17.166
A little spray action.

00:15.041 --> 00:17.166
We'll be done in no time.

00:17.208 --> 00:20.291
And have this stuff

00:17.208 --> 00:20.291
gum up my pipes? Forget it.

00:20.333 --> 00:23.542
I know it's a dreary chore,

00:20.333 --> 00:23.542
but it has to be done.

00:23.583 --> 00:25.333
Boats don't take care

00:23.583 --> 00:25.333
of themselves.

00:25.375 --> 00:27.583
Hmm. Maybe we can

00:25.375 --> 00:27.583
invent one that does.

00:27.625 --> 00:29.083
( yelping )

00:29.125 --> 00:30.583
What's that?

00:30.625 --> 00:32.041
( yapping )

00:34.375 --> 00:37.458
( yapping )

00:37.500 --> 00:39.583
That animal is trespassing

00:37.500 --> 00:39.583
on city property.

00:39.625 --> 00:41.542
How on earth

00:39.625 --> 00:41.542
did he get up there?

00:41.583 --> 00:44.542
( whimpering )

00:44.583 --> 00:47.208
Aww...the poor

00:44.583 --> 00:47.208
little guy's stuck.

00:47.250 --> 00:50.208
He looks so scared!

00:47.250 --> 00:50.208
I'll jump over and get him.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.500
Wait...look!

00:52.792 --> 00:55.083
( whimpering )

00:55.125 --> 00:56.500
Tide's coming in.

00:56.542 --> 00:59.166
The next wave will be

00:56.542 --> 00:59.166
high enough to hit him!

Heatwave, grab on!

( barking )

02:01.750 --> 02:03.291
It's okay, fella.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.291
We'll get you out of here.

( grunting )

Come on!

( gasping )

02:15.542 --> 02:16.917
Look out!

02:15.542 --> 02:16.917
Boulder!

02:15.542 --> 02:16.917
Boulder.

02:23.667 --> 02:24.834
I'm okay.

02:24.875 --> 02:28.834
( dog whimpering )

02:33.041 --> 02:35.959
( panting )

02:37.583 --> 02:39.250
It's all right, boy.

02:39.291 --> 02:40.709
You're fine now.

02:41.875 --> 02:43.125
( laughing )

02:43.166 --> 02:45.667
Well, it looks like

02:43.166 --> 02:45.667
somebody made a friend.

02:45.709 --> 02:48.125
And here comes the question

02:45.709 --> 02:48.125
in three, two, one...

02:48.166 --> 02:49.667
Can I keep him, Dad?

02:49.709 --> 02:52.041
We have to look

02:49.709 --> 02:52.041
for the owner first, Cody.

02:53.542 --> 02:54.750
Won't be easy.

02:54.792 --> 02:56.500
Looks like

02:54.792 --> 02:56.500
he lost his tags.

02:56.542 --> 02:58.041
He doesn't look familiar.

02:58.083 --> 03:00.250
Oh, right.

02:58.083 --> 03:00.250
You know every dog in town?

03:00.291 --> 03:02.959
From up there, Blades and I

03:00.291 --> 03:02.959
can see everything.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.500
Like last Thursday night,

03:04.542 --> 03:06.667
when you and Hayley

03:04.542 --> 03:06.667
went to the drive-in.

03:06.709 --> 03:09.834
( coughing )

03:06.709 --> 03:09.834
Okay. Yeah, this dog

03:06.709 --> 03:09.834
doesn't look familiar.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.625
The Griffin Rock Dog Show

03:09.875 --> 03:11.625
is in a few days.

03:11.667 --> 03:13.792
Maybe somebody

03:11.667 --> 03:13.792
brought him for that.

03:13.834 --> 03:15.834
Good idea.

03:13.834 --> 03:15.834
I'll check into it.

03:15.875 --> 03:18.709
I'd take care of him, Dad.

03:15.875 --> 03:18.709
I'd feed and walk him...

03:18.750 --> 03:20.250
I don't doubt that, Cody.

03:20.291 --> 03:22.875
But let's do our best

03:20.291 --> 03:22.875
to find the owner,

03:22.917 --> 03:25.041
and then take it

03:22.917 --> 03:25.041
from there, okay?

03:25.083 --> 03:27.709
Cute little fella,

03:25.083 --> 03:27.709
though, isn't he?

03:29.041 --> 03:31.583
Now what are we

03:29.041 --> 03:31.583
going to call you, boy?

03:31.625 --> 03:32.959
( dog panting )

03:33.000 --> 03:34.959
The most popular names

03:33.000 --> 03:34.959
for boy dogs

03:35.000 --> 03:36.208
are "Max" and "Buddy".

03:36.250 --> 03:39.500
Where'd you get that?

03:36.250 --> 03:39.500
The Internet.

03:39.542 --> 03:40.792
So it must be true.

03:40.834 --> 03:44.667
He needs a really cool name.

03:40.834 --> 03:44.667
Something awesome.

03:44.709 --> 03:47.500
Something...noble.

03:47.542 --> 03:50.083
That's it!

03:47.542 --> 03:50.083
From now on, you're Noble.

03:50.125 --> 03:51.500
Oh, dear.

03:51.542 --> 03:52.834
That appears to have provoked

03:52.875 --> 03:54.834
a reaction

03:52.875 --> 03:54.834
in his rear appendage.

03:54.875 --> 03:56.917
Dogs wag their tails

03:54.875 --> 03:56.917
when they're happy, Chase.

03:56.959 --> 03:59.083
It must mean

03:56.959 --> 03:59.083
he likes his new name.

03:59.125 --> 04:01.750
Now that you have a dog,

03:59.125 --> 04:01.750
what do you do with it?

04:01.792 --> 04:03.250
You pet him.

04:03.291 --> 04:05.083
Take him for walks.

04:05.125 --> 04:06.625
Teach him tricks.

04:06.667 --> 04:07.875
Noble, come here, boy.

04:09.542 --> 04:10.709
Lie down.

04:12.125 --> 04:13.709
Speak, boy.

04:15.208 --> 04:16.750
Impressive.

04:16.792 --> 04:20.166
Aw, he's just had

04:16.792 --> 04:20.166
a rough day.

04:20.208 --> 04:22.834
Woof!

04:20.208 --> 04:22.834
Haven't you? Yes, you have!

04:22.875 --> 04:24.083
( giggles )

04:24.125 --> 04:26.500
Well, son, I checked

04:24.125 --> 04:26.500
the dog show.

04:26.542 --> 04:28.667
No one who entered

04:26.542 --> 04:28.667
is missing a pet,

04:28.709 --> 04:31.667
so I made a dozen of these

04:28.709 --> 04:31.667
to put around town.

04:31.709 --> 04:33.667
CHIEF:

04:31.709 --> 04:33.667
Found: This dog.

04:33.709 --> 04:36.709
If he belongs to you, please

04:33.709 --> 04:36.709
contact Chief Charlie Burns

04:36.750 --> 04:39.625
at the Griffin Rock

04:36.750 --> 04:39.625
Firehouse.

04:39.667 --> 04:41.500
I'll help you take 'em

04:39.667 --> 04:41.500
around, Dad.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.709
You guys don't mind

04:41.542 --> 04:43.709
watching Noble, do you?

04:45.542 --> 04:47.667
Noble?

04:45.542 --> 04:47.667
Heh, heh.

04:47.709 --> 04:50.625
Just don't go getting

04:47.709 --> 04:50.625
too attached to him, son.

04:50.667 --> 04:53.291
His owner's bound

04:50.667 --> 04:53.291
to turn up eventually.

04:56.166 --> 04:59.667
I know a trick

04:56.166 --> 04:59.667
I bet he can do.

04:59.709 --> 05:01.208
Sit, boy!

05:01.250 --> 05:02.875
Good dog!

05:02.917 --> 05:04.083
Now watch this one.

05:04.125 --> 05:06.041
Stay!

05:06.083 --> 05:08.208
Look at that.

05:06.083 --> 05:08.208
See how smart he is?

05:08.250 --> 05:11.083
I'll never understand

05:08.250 --> 05:11.083
why humans want pets anyway.

05:11.125 --> 05:12.667
They don't seem very useful.

05:12.709 --> 05:14.750
May I remind you, Heatwave.

05:14.792 --> 05:17.500
You once said

05:14.792 --> 05:17.500
the same thing about infants.

05:17.542 --> 05:19.041
( groans )

05:19.083 --> 05:21.792
Wait...you mean Noble's supposed

05:19.083 --> 05:21.792
to be wearing a diaper?

05:21.834 --> 05:24.709
In that area,

05:21.834 --> 05:24.709
this K-9 manual suggests

05:24.750 --> 05:27.125
something called

05:24.750 --> 05:27.125
"newspaper training."

05:27.166 --> 05:30.208
So, we teach him to read?

05:30.250 --> 05:32.000
(  mellow theme playing  )

05:32.041 --> 05:33.792
CHIEF ( recording ):

05:32.041 --> 05:33.792
Found: This dog.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.917
CHIEF ( recording ):

05:33.834 --> 05:36.917
Found: This dog.

05:36.959 --> 05:38.625
FRANKIE: Showtime!

05:36.959 --> 05:38.625
If he belongs to you,

05:38.667 --> 05:39.834
please contact...

05:39.875 --> 05:41.000
Good boy!

05:41.041 --> 05:42.625
Oh, hey, Cody!

05:42.667 --> 05:44.750
Watch what my boys learned

05:42.667 --> 05:44.750
for the dog show!

05:44.792 --> 05:47.208
Aristotle, Edison,

05:44.792 --> 05:47.208
showtime!

05:53.583 --> 05:56.000
Good boys.

05:53.583 --> 05:56.000
That's their trigger word.

05:56.041 --> 05:58.583
Whenever I say it,

05:56.041 --> 05:58.583
they know to do a trick.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.625
Can I try?

05:58.625 --> 06:00.625
Showtime!

06:01.917 --> 06:03.625
( chuckling )

06:03.667 --> 06:05.834
I don't think Noble could

06:03.667 --> 06:05.834
ever learn anything like that.

06:05.875 --> 06:08.250
Who's Noble?

06:05.875 --> 06:08.250
Besides me, of course.

06:08.291 --> 06:11.750
That's the dog we found.

06:08.291 --> 06:11.750
He's not too good at tricks.

06:11.792 --> 06:13.917
Well, that doesn't mean

06:11.792 --> 06:13.917
you can't enter him in the show.

06:13.959 --> 06:15.542
It'll be a blast!

06:15.583 --> 06:20.542
And you can watch us win

06:15.583 --> 06:20.542
the blue ribbon. Showtime!

06:22.625 --> 06:26.166
HUXLEY:

06:22.625 --> 06:26.166
I'm your host,

06:22.625 --> 06:26.166
Huxley Prescott.

06:26.208 --> 06:28.166
( one person applauding )

06:28.208 --> 06:30.208
Thank you and welcome

06:30.250 --> 06:33.792
to the 39th annual

06:30.250 --> 06:33.792
Griffin Rock Dog Show!

06:33.834 --> 06:36.750
As we do every year,

06:33.834 --> 06:36.750
we'll kick things off...

06:36.792 --> 06:38.250
Ooh. Looks like they've

06:36.792 --> 06:38.250
already started.

06:38.291 --> 06:40.166
Better get up there, son.

06:40.208 --> 06:43.667
I don't think "sit" and "stay"

06:40.208 --> 06:43.667
are gonna win this for us, boy.

06:43.709 --> 06:45.083
But we'll have fun anyway.

06:45.125 --> 06:47.834
I'm proud of you for trying.

06:45.125 --> 06:47.834
KADE: Is it over?

06:47.875 --> 06:50.500
Did we win?

06:47.875 --> 06:50.500
What are you all doing here?

06:50.542 --> 06:53.709
To root for Noble.

06:50.542 --> 06:53.709
And so did the Bots.

06:53.750 --> 06:56.959
Our presence also ensures

06:53.750 --> 06:56.959
the event's safety.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.750
( chuckles )

06:57.000 --> 06:59.750
All right.

06:59.792 --> 07:02.500
Just be on good

06:59.792 --> 07:02.500
robot behavior.

07:02.542 --> 07:03.834
Blades.

07:03.875 --> 07:08.166
What? Why me?

07:03.875 --> 07:08.166
I never--

07:08.208 --> 07:09.625
Affirmative.

07:09.667 --> 07:11.625
Thanks for coming, guys.

07:11.667 --> 07:15.000
And now let's meet

07:11.667 --> 07:15.000
our contestants.

07:15.041 --> 07:18.667
The mayor's wife,

07:15.041 --> 07:18.667
Mrs. Luskey, with Poopsie.

07:18.709 --> 07:21.959
Francine Greene with her dogs

07:18.709 --> 07:21.959
Aristotle and Edison.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Priscilla Pynch with her

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
state-of-the-art robo dog,

07:25.041 --> 07:26.583
Wi-Fido.

07:26.625 --> 07:28.083
Cute.

07:28.125 --> 07:32.041
And Mrs. Neederlander

07:28.125 --> 07:32.041
and her...cat?

07:32.083 --> 07:33.250
( audience laughing )

07:33.291 --> 07:34.834
Mr. Pettypaws?

07:34.875 --> 07:37.875
A cat seems a blatant

07:34.875 --> 07:37.875
violation of the rules.

07:37.917 --> 07:39.166
You want to tell her?

07:39.208 --> 07:41.000
( hissing )

07:39.208 --> 07:41.000
( gasping )

07:41.041 --> 07:43.000
Point taken.

07:43.041 --> 07:45.125
And doesn't Mr. Pettypaws

07:43.041 --> 07:45.125
look nice today?

07:45.166 --> 07:49.166
And looks like we have

07:45.166 --> 07:49.166
a late entry, Cody Burns

07:49.208 --> 07:50.583
and his dog, Noble.

07:50.625 --> 07:52.000
( applauding )

07:52.041 --> 07:55.875
All right, pooches,

07:52.041 --> 07:55.875
let's see what you have!

07:59.667 --> 08:03.041
( Poopsie barking )

08:03.083 --> 08:04.750
( barking )

08:04.792 --> 08:06.542
( audience applauding )

08:06.583 --> 08:08.500
Showtime!

08:08.542 --> 08:12.166
( Aristotle and Edison

08:08.542 --> 08:12.166
exchanging barks )

08:12.208 --> 08:14.000
( audience applauding )

08:14.041 --> 08:17.166
Wi-Fido has several settings.

08:17.208 --> 08:19.000
Puppy.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.709
( barking )

08:20.750 --> 08:22.500
Show dog.

08:22.542 --> 08:24.667
PRISCILLA:

08:22.542 --> 08:24.667
Guard dog.

08:24.709 --> 08:26.583
Grrr!

08:24.709 --> 08:26.583
Hah!

08:26.625 --> 08:28.625
( audience applauding )

08:28.667 --> 08:32.625
Lie down.

08:32.667 --> 08:33.834
Sit, boy.

08:33.875 --> 08:35.000
Good.

08:35.041 --> 08:37.500
I taught him that.

08:37.542 --> 08:40.250
And now Mrs. Neederlander

08:37.542 --> 08:40.250
and her cat, Mr. Pettypaws,

08:40.291 --> 08:45.875
will perform their...

08:40.291 --> 08:45.875
famous jump-through-fire trick.

08:45.917 --> 08:49.542
I'm not sure which of them does

08:45.917 --> 08:49.542
the actual jumping, but, um...

08:49.583 --> 08:50.750
Ahh!

08:50.792 --> 08:52.875
( Huxley gasping )

08:52.917 --> 08:54.125
Fire!

08:54.166 --> 08:55.834
(  dramatic theme playing  )

08:55.875 --> 08:58.542
( audience panicking )

08:58.583 --> 09:00.250
Don't panic, folks!

09:00.291 --> 09:02.291
Robots, open those sideflaps!

09:05.291 --> 09:10.208
( screaming )

09:18.041 --> 09:20.000
Come on, Mrs. Neederlander!

09:24.166 --> 09:26.041
I think that's

09:24.166 --> 09:26.041
everybody, Dad.

09:27.792 --> 09:29.625
But where's Frankie?

09:39.125 --> 09:42.667
Poopsie...

09:39.125 --> 09:42.667
She's still inside.

09:42.709 --> 09:45.000
MRS. LUSKEY:

09:42.709 --> 09:45.000
Someone rescue my Poopsie!

09:45.041 --> 09:48.208
( barking )

09:50.834 --> 09:53.041
Noble!

09:55.542 --> 09:57.166
(  dramatic theme playing  )

09:57.208 --> 09:59.792
FireBot, save those dogs!

10:01.166 --> 10:04.041
( Noble barking )

10:04.083 --> 10:06.083
(  triumphant theme playing  )

10:12.291 --> 10:14.375
You naughty Poopsie!

10:14.417 --> 10:16.375
Good boy!

10:16.417 --> 10:18.750
Your dog deserves a medal.

10:18.792 --> 10:21.583
And I'll make sure

10:18.792 --> 10:21.583
my husband gives him one.

10:21.625 --> 10:24.166
( in robotic voice )

10:21.625 --> 10:24.166
Fire has been extinguished.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.041
Not bad.

10:26.083 --> 10:29.333
For a mutt.

10:26.083 --> 10:29.333
How much do you want for him?

10:29.375 --> 10:31.500
Sorry, Priscilla.

10:29.375 --> 10:31.500
He's not for sale.

10:31.542 --> 10:33.041
Hmph!

10:33.083 --> 10:35.166
Why can't you do

10:33.083 --> 10:35.166
things like that?

10:35.208 --> 10:38.208
( barking )

10:39.709 --> 10:43.667
Guess you can't re-program

10:39.709 --> 10:43.667
an old dog with new tricks.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.083
( chuckles )

10:45.125 --> 10:46.333
Right?

10:46.375 --> 10:48.542
We need to secure

10:46.375 --> 10:48.542
this area, folks.

10:48.583 --> 10:50.250
Everybody head on home.

10:50.291 --> 10:52.083
( townsfolk murmuring )

10:52.125 --> 10:53.291
I don't get it.

10:53.333 --> 10:54.709
Noble can't do tricks,

10:54.750 --> 10:57.166
but out of nowhere,

10:54.750 --> 10:57.166
he makes that amazing rescue.

10:57.208 --> 10:59.208
( Noble barking )

10:59.250 --> 11:00.750
Wow!

10:59.250 --> 11:00.750
And then he does that!

11:00.792 --> 11:02.458
What...

11:00.792 --> 11:02.458
That's amazing!

11:02.500 --> 11:04.667
This dog is just weird.

11:04.709 --> 11:07.125
No!

11:04.709 --> 11:07.125
It's a trigger word.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.500
Frankie uses "showtime"

11:07.166 --> 11:09.500
for her dogs.

11:09.542 --> 11:11.375
Noble's trigger word must be...

11:13.417 --> 11:15.375
Rescue!

11:17.041 --> 11:18.250
( laughing )

11:18.291 --> 11:20.208
All right! Good boy!

11:18.291 --> 11:20.208
It's so cool.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.125
( Noble panting )

11:22.166 --> 11:23.375
That's awesome!

11:23.417 --> 11:26.000
So Noble's been trained

11:23.417 --> 11:26.000
as a rescue dog?

11:26.041 --> 11:29.333
Woof! Woof!

11:26.041 --> 11:29.333
Sweet.

11:29.375 --> 11:31.208
He could join

11:29.375 --> 11:31.208
our team!

11:31.250 --> 11:33.583
While retrieving dead

11:31.250 --> 11:33.583
organic matter is impressive,

11:33.625 --> 11:36.375
one wonders whether Noble could

11:33.625 --> 11:36.375
perform admirably in the field.

11:36.417 --> 11:38.125
Are you kidding?

11:38.166 --> 11:40.333
Didn't you see how he saved

11:38.166 --> 11:40.333
that little rat-dog?

11:40.375 --> 11:43.375
This guy knew exactly what

11:40.375 --> 11:43.375
he was doing, didn't you, boy?

11:43.417 --> 11:45.166
( Heatwave chuckling )

11:45.208 --> 11:48.166
I think I understand now why

11:45.208 --> 11:48.166
humans might want you around.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.500
( chuckling )

11:50.542 --> 11:52.333
Stop.

11:52.375 --> 11:54.375
(  dramatic theme playing  )

11:59.208 --> 12:00.458
MAN:

11:59.208 --> 12:00.458
Huh!

12:00.500 --> 12:02.291
( Cody gasping )

12:02.333 --> 12:04.166
Noble...rescue!

12:05.375 --> 12:07.583
( Noble barking )

12:14.291 --> 12:17.250
Good boy.

12:14.291 --> 12:17.250
Woof!

12:26.208 --> 12:28.208
( barks )

12:28.250 --> 12:31.083
( Noble growling )

12:37.333 --> 12:39.375
( applauding )

12:39.417 --> 12:41.583
( Noble panting )

12:41.625 --> 12:43.750
( barks )

12:43.792 --> 12:47.709
( applauding )

12:50.709 --> 12:53.000
Good day's work, boy.

12:53.041 --> 12:54.375
You sure earned this.

12:54.417 --> 12:56.333
DANI:

12:54.417 --> 12:56.333
Good idea.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.667
No work, no food, Kade.

12:58.709 --> 13:01.417
Hey, I put in a full day!

13:01.458 --> 13:04.417
I took care of that...thing.

13:01.458 --> 13:04.417
And then that other one.

13:04.458 --> 13:07.333
Noble's been a great addition

13:04.458 --> 13:07.333
to the team, all right.

13:07.375 --> 13:10.083
I don't know how we ever

13:07.375 --> 13:10.083
got along without him.

13:10.125 --> 13:12.125
Maybe he could be

13:10.125 --> 13:12.125
a permanent addition?

13:12.166 --> 13:13.667
Don't know why not, son.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.625
There's still no sign

13:13.709 --> 13:15.625
of his owner.

13:15.667 --> 13:17.583
And you've proven

13:15.667 --> 13:17.583
you can take care of him.

13:17.625 --> 13:19.166
Did you hear that, boy?

13:19.208 --> 13:20.542
( panting )

13:20.583 --> 13:23.166
( phone ringing )

13:23.208 --> 13:26.166
Emergency response.

13:26.208 --> 13:27.750
Parking brake

13:26.208 --> 13:27.750
went out on a semi.

13:27.792 --> 13:29.583
It's headed downtown

13:27.792 --> 13:29.583
without its driver.

13:29.625 --> 13:31.000
Let's move, team!

13:31.041 --> 13:33.041
(  dramatic theme playing  )

13:40.375 --> 13:43.583
Rescue Bots

13:40.375 --> 13:43.583
and Rescue Dog,

13:43.625 --> 13:45.667
roll to the rescue!

13:45.709 --> 13:51.041
( sirens wailing )

13:56.041 --> 13:59.250
( sirens wailing )

14:03.291 --> 14:05.125
Kids, close off the streets

14:03.291 --> 14:05.125
behind us.

14:05.166 --> 14:07.250
Clear everybody out.

14:05.166 --> 14:07.250
Heatwave...

14:11.208 --> 14:13.375
Clear the sidewalks,

14:11.208 --> 14:13.375
everybody!

14:16.083 --> 14:20.000
Power-Up and energize!

14:20.041 --> 14:22.000
BOULDER:

14:20.041 --> 14:22.000
Aim for the front axle.

14:22.041 --> 14:25.667
Adjusting for acceleration,

14:22.041 --> 14:25.667
wind speed, downhill angle...

14:25.709 --> 14:28.500
Fire in five, four,

14:25.709 --> 14:28.500
three, two--

14:28.542 --> 14:29.709
Now!

14:30.709 --> 14:32.166
That'll work.

14:32.208 --> 14:34.583
( tires screeching )

14:34.625 --> 14:36.041
( grunts )

14:38.417 --> 14:40.125
Noble, rescue!

14:40.166 --> 14:42.583
(  dramatic theme playing  )

14:42.625 --> 14:44.542
( Noble barking )

14:44.583 --> 14:46.542
What...

14:44.583 --> 14:46.542
Why are you--

14:47.625 --> 14:50.333
( Noble growling )

14:47.625 --> 14:50.333
( tire crashes )

14:50.375 --> 14:51.500
CODY:

14:50.375 --> 14:51.500
Good boy!

14:51.542 --> 14:54.625
Mr. Hunter,

14:51.542 --> 14:54.625
are you all right?

14:56.458 --> 15:01.125
Um...Cody, you might

14:56.458 --> 15:01.125
want to see this.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.041
It's a paper from the mainland.

15:03.083 --> 15:05.542
Hey, it's a picture

15:03.083 --> 15:05.542
of Noble!

15:05.583 --> 15:11.542
Yeah, only...it looks like

15:05.583 --> 15:11.542
his real name is Buster.

15:11.583 --> 15:13.291
( Noble barking )

15:13.333 --> 15:16.208
"Lost at sea

15:13.333 --> 15:16.208
while making a water rescue

15:16.250 --> 15:18.041

to the mainland.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.250
"Buster is owned

Fire Department."

15:22.709 --> 15:24.125
( barking )

15:24.166 --> 15:26.667
That how he got

15:24.166 --> 15:26.667
washed up in that culvert.

15:26.709 --> 15:30.667
So he's a fire dog.

15:26.709 --> 15:30.667
Huh! Should have known.

15:30.709 --> 15:33.709
Hooray!

15:30.709 --> 15:33.709
We found Noble's owner!

15:36.709 --> 15:41.333
I mean... Oh, no!"

15:36.709 --> 15:41.333
We found Noble's owner!

15:41.375 --> 15:44.333
( sighing )

15:41.375 --> 15:44.333
I better go tell my dad.

15:44.375 --> 15:45.667
Poor Cody.

15:45.709 --> 15:47.709
(  melancholic theme playing  )

15:54.375 --> 15:56.542
He has become

15:54.375 --> 15:56.542
very fond of Noble.

15:56.583 --> 15:58.333
We all have.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.625
Hey, where is Noble anyway?

16:00.667 --> 16:02.583
Noble?

16:00.667 --> 16:02.583
Here boy!

16:02.625 --> 16:04.208
K-9 respond.

16:02.625 --> 16:04.208
CHASE: Where are you boy!

16:04.250 --> 16:05.667
( whistles )

16:05.709 --> 16:07.500
What's going on?

16:07.542 --> 16:09.208
Cody, Noble's missing!

16:13.083 --> 16:14.750
Puppy!

16:13.083 --> 16:14.750
Dog. Noble.

16:14.792 --> 16:16.166
Dog.

16:14.792 --> 16:16.166
Here, puppy.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.750
Come on, Noble.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.750
Where are you?

16:17.792 --> 16:19.667
Noble!

16:19.709 --> 16:21.667
( sighs )

16:19.709 --> 16:21.667
I thought for sure

16:19.709 --> 16:21.667
he'd head back home.

16:21.709 --> 16:24.041
Why would he just run off?

16:21.709 --> 16:24.041
I thought he liked us.

16:24.083 --> 16:26.208
He wouldn't.

16:24.083 --> 16:26.208
And he does.

16:26.250 --> 16:29.166
Somebody must have

16:26.250 --> 16:29.166
taken him.

16:29.208 --> 16:30.417
Priscilla!

16:30.458 --> 16:32.333
She's used to getting

16:30.458 --> 16:32.333
what she wants.

16:32.375 --> 16:34.500
She probably figured

16:32.375 --> 16:34.500
if she couldn't buy Noble,

16:34.542 --> 16:36.166
she'd just take him.

16:36.208 --> 16:38.333
I hate to accuse anyone

16:36.208 --> 16:38.333
without proof, son.

16:38.375 --> 16:41.041
We can ask her

16:38.375 --> 16:41.041
if she's seen Noble, Dad.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.542
You're right.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.542
And if she hasn't,

16:42.583 --> 16:46.333
we scratch her off the list

16:42.583 --> 16:46.333
and keep looking.

16:46.375 --> 16:49.417
And I think I know

16:46.375 --> 16:49.417
where we can find her.

16:50.750 --> 16:52.125
MAYOR:

16:50.750 --> 16:52.125
Is this on?

16:52.166 --> 16:53.333
( feedback )

16:53.375 --> 16:55.166
Oh... Whoa!

16:53.375 --> 16:55.166
All right, uh...

16:55.208 --> 16:57.667
We've received word

16:55.208 --> 16:57.667
that Mrs. Madeline Pynch

16:57.709 --> 16:59.709
is delayed

16:57.709 --> 16:59.709
on the mainland,

16:59.750 --> 17:02.333
so her daughter,

16:59.750 --> 17:02.333
Priscilla,

17:02.375 --> 17:05.250
will represent her

17:02.375 --> 17:05.250
as we dedicate

17:05.291 --> 17:07.667
the Phase 1 completion

17:05.291 --> 17:07.667
of Pynch Square.

17:07.709 --> 17:12.166
The newest addition to our

17:07.709 --> 17:12.166
town's commercial enterprises.

17:12.208 --> 17:15.583
And to join in the

17:12.208 --> 17:15.583
groundbreaking for Phase 2...

17:17.417 --> 17:19.542
( growling )

17:19.583 --> 17:21.709
We'll talk

17:19.583 --> 17:21.709
to her later, Cody.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.125
( whimpering )

17:23.166 --> 17:24.458
Over there!

17:24.500 --> 17:26.125
That's Noble! That's my dog!

17:24.500 --> 17:26.125
Grrr!

17:26.166 --> 17:29.166
How can he be your dog

17:26.166 --> 17:29.166
when he's in my limo?

17:29.208 --> 17:31.709
( stuttering )

17:29.208 --> 17:31.709
Is there a problem, Chief?

17:31.750 --> 17:34.667
I hope it's just

17:31.750 --> 17:34.667
a misunderstanding, Mayor,

17:34.709 --> 17:38.583
because dog-napping

17:34.709 --> 17:38.583
is a pretty serious offense.

17:38.625 --> 17:42.291
A misdemeanor

17:38.625 --> 17:42.291
under Civil Code 147.02.

17:42.333 --> 17:44.333
I found that dog

17:42.333 --> 17:44.333
running loose.

17:44.375 --> 17:46.125
If you can't keep him

17:44.375 --> 17:46.125
under control,

17:46.166 --> 17:48.458
it's not my fault.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.458
NOBLE: Woof! Woof! Woof!

17:48.500 --> 17:49.667
( Wi-Fido growling )

17:49.709 --> 17:51.542
I'll let him out, Dad.

17:51.583 --> 17:54.166
( Wi-Fido snarling )

17:54.208 --> 17:56.542
Priscilla, better call off

17:54.208 --> 17:56.542
that barking bot.

17:56.583 --> 18:00.000
All right, but he's just

17:56.583 --> 18:00.000
protecting family property.

18:00.041 --> 18:01.333
( slight grunt )

18:01.375 --> 18:03.166
( vicious growling )

18:03.208 --> 18:05.250
It won't move.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.250
It's broken!

18:05.291 --> 18:06.458
( frustrated groan )

18:06.500 --> 18:08.417
All right, then.

18:08.458 --> 18:11.333
Rescue Bots,

18:08.458 --> 18:11.333
protect my family property.

18:11.375 --> 18:13.000
(  dramatic theme playing  )

18:13.041 --> 18:14.375
Uh-oh!

18:16.458 --> 18:19.375
Bark! Bark!

18:19.417 --> 18:22.208
Bark! Bark! Bark!

18:23.375 --> 18:25.166
( crowd panicking )

18:25.208 --> 18:26.417
This way, folks!

18:28.125 --> 18:29.333
( panting excitedly )

18:29.375 --> 18:31.709
Noble! I'm glad

18:29.375 --> 18:31.709
to see you, too!

18:31.750 --> 18:33.709
BLADES:

18:31.750 --> 18:33.709
Ahh!

18:33.750 --> 18:35.542
( grunting )

18:37.750 --> 18:39.125
Yap-yap!

18:39.166 --> 18:40.375
( stuttering in fear )

18:41.625 --> 18:44.667
( panicking )

18:44.709 --> 18:49.625
( electricity crackling )

18:53.333 --> 18:55.333
Hey!

18:58.709 --> 19:01.667
Watch it!

18:58.709 --> 19:01.667
Whoa!

19:03.709 --> 19:05.625
Aah. Heh!

19:06.625 --> 19:08.333
( Wi-Fido barking )

19:08.375 --> 19:11.291
Get away! Get away from me!

19:08.375 --> 19:11.291
Grrr!

19:11.333 --> 19:12.542
( barking angrily )

19:20.583 --> 19:23.709
( screams )

19:25.792 --> 19:29.709
Boulder, a little help.

19:29.750 --> 19:33.375
Power-up and energize!

19:37.375 --> 19:43.333
It's bulldozers like you

19:37.375 --> 19:43.333
who give us all a bad name.

19:45.041 --> 19:48.542
( barking )

19:51.417 --> 19:53.709
Noble, rescue Priscilla!

19:55.709 --> 19:58.291
Snarl.

19:55.709 --> 19:58.291
See this snarl.

19:58.333 --> 20:01.333
Snarl!

20:01.375 --> 20:03.333
( crashing sound )

20:03.375 --> 20:06.250
Snarl...

20:06.291 --> 20:07.500
Noble...

20:10.417 --> 20:11.583
Good boy.

20:11.625 --> 20:13.000
( panting )

20:13.041 --> 20:14.166
Oh, that's a good boy.

20:14.208 --> 20:15.375
( sighs )

20:15.417 --> 20:16.583
PRISCILLA:

20:15.417 --> 20:16.583
Hello?

20:16.625 --> 20:18.583
Is somebody gonna get me down?

20:18.625 --> 20:23.083
PoliceBot, please escort

20:18.625 --> 20:23.083
Miss Pynch to safety.

20:28.709 --> 20:31.417
Thank you!

20:31.458 --> 20:33.125
Arf!

20:33.166 --> 20:35.166
Some dog you are.

20:35.208 --> 20:38.250
I'm gonna have my mother

20:35.208 --> 20:38.250
buy the company that made you

20:38.291 --> 20:40.417
and put it out of business.

20:41.625 --> 20:44.500
(  mellow theme playing  )

20:44.542 --> 20:46.083
CODY:

20:44.542 --> 20:46.083
Goodbye, Noble.

20:46.125 --> 20:48.125
I mean...Buster.

20:48.166 --> 20:50.125
You're the best dog

20:48.166 --> 20:50.125
anybody could have.

20:50.166 --> 20:53.000
We'll miss you.

20:50.166 --> 20:53.000
Proud to serve with you, Buster.

20:53.041 --> 20:55.250
May all your chew toys

20:53.041 --> 20:55.250
be satisfying.

20:55.291 --> 20:56.667
Buster, sit!

20:56.709 --> 20:58.041
( barks )

20:58.083 --> 20:59.500
Good dog.

20:59.542 --> 21:02.375
( whistle sounds )

21:02.417 --> 21:05.458
Go, boy.

21:15.458 --> 21:19.000
If I had a tail,

21:15.458 --> 21:19.000
it would not be wagging.

21:19.041 --> 21:21.208
You'll find your own dog

21:19.041 --> 21:21.208
someday, Cody.

21:21.250 --> 21:23.583
And we'll help you

21:21.250 --> 21:23.583
train it.

21:23.625 --> 21:27.417
Just as long as there are

21:23.625 --> 21:27.417
no diapers involved.

21:27.458 --> 21:29.709
( Noble barking )

21:33.542 --> 21:35.542
(  dramatic theme playing  )
