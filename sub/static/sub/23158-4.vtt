00:00.039 --> 00:02.371
<i>Blue Light, it's a MiG-30.</i>
<i>Russian markings.</i>

00:02.442 --> 00:03.909
<i>I'm on his six.</i>

00:06.512 --> 00:09.572
My fiancee is here
with a Soviet track team.

00:09.649 --> 00:12.015
<i>She also wants to defect.</i>

00:12.085 --> 00:15.145
You don't know these people.
I will never get out of here.

00:15.221 --> 00:16.848
It should be
turned over to the FBI.

00:16.923 --> 00:18.857
By the time they interview us,
file a report,

00:18.925 --> 00:20.415
get instructions
from Washington,

00:20.493 --> 00:21.790
Yuri will be in Moscow.

00:21.861 --> 00:23.055
Where is Yuri?

00:23.129 --> 00:24.221
Now, where is he?

00:24.297 --> 00:25.389
You won't shoot me.

01:37.572 --> 01:39.506
<i>Blue Light, Beta-One.</i>
<i>We're airborne.</i>

01:39.574 --> 01:42.168
<i>Roger. You are cleared</i>
<i>to Angels 30.</i>

01:42.243 --> 01:45.371
<i>Take a heading</i>
<i>of 350 to intercept.</i>

01:45.446 --> 01:48.108
<i>Spark 115. Over.</i>

01:48.182 --> 01:52.084
<i>Beta-One climbing Angels 30.</i>
<i>Heading 350, Spark 115.</i>

02:05.766 --> 02:06.858
Any change?

02:06.934 --> 02:08.663
No, sir.
The aircraft's still approaching.

02:08.735 --> 02:09.828
Have we made contact?

02:09.904 --> 02:12.065
There's no reply to our
radio transmissions.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.967
When are we intercepting,
Major?

02:14.041 --> 02:15.440
Any moment,
sir.

02:22.216 --> 02:24.411
Any chance that
it's one of ours?

02:28.155 --> 02:30.248
<i>Blue Light, Beta-One.</i>
<i>Angels 30.</i>

02:30.324 --> 02:33.350
<i>Roger.</i>
<i>Take a heading of 270.</i>

02:33.427 --> 02:35.827
<i>Bogey at 12:00,</i>
<i>40 miles.</i>

02:35.897 --> 02:38.331
<i>Do you have visual contact?</i>
<i>Over.</i>

02:38.833 --> 02:40.698
<i>Negative. Radar only.</i>

02:41.068 --> 02:42.501
<i>Ah, wait one.</i>

02:45.239 --> 02:46.763
<i>We have bogey in sight.</i>

02:49.911 --> 02:50.969
<i>Tallyho!</i>

02:51.045 --> 02:52.603
<i>Roger.</i>

03:01.222 --> 03:03.713
<i>Blue Light, it's a MiG-30.</i>
<i>Russian markings.</i>

03:03.791 --> 03:04.985
<i>I'm on his six.</i>

03:07.161 --> 03:09.527
The Russians have never let
them out of the Eastern Bloc.

03:09.597 --> 03:11.326
What the hell's it
doing here?

03:11.399 --> 03:14.266
<i>The pilot doesn't respond</i>
<i>to radio contact. Over.</i>

03:14.335 --> 03:16.064
He might not
be able to, sir.

03:16.137 --> 03:18.662
The Russians only give their
pilots a narrow frequency band.

03:18.739 --> 03:20.764
They don't want them
making foreign contact.

03:21.175 --> 03:23.234
<i>On his six. On his six.</i>

03:23.311 --> 03:25.302
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>we're awaiting instructions.</i>

03:27.048 --> 03:29.039
<i>Roger, wait one.</i>

03:33.120 --> 03:34.314
Beta-One,

03:35.289 --> 03:37.951
this is Colonel Halver.
Stay on him.

03:38.559 --> 03:42.120
But don't take any offensive
action at this time. Over.

03:42.797 --> 03:43.923
<i>Roger.</i>

03:44.732 --> 03:46.666
Put the base on alert.

03:47.868 --> 03:49.165
Yes, sir.

03:50.938 --> 03:52.872
<i>Blue Light,</i>
<i>he's lowering his gear.</i>

03:52.940 --> 03:54.840
<i>Repeat.</i>
<i>He's lowering his gear.</i>

03:58.245 --> 04:01.578
Beta-One,
allow the plane to land.

05:41.315 --> 05:43.408
I request political asylum.

05:44.985 --> 05:46.111
Freedom.

05:49.724 --> 05:50.952
This is for you.

05:58.099 --> 05:59.589
<i>Business had been slow.</i>

05:59.667 --> 06:02.261
<i>Not even a divorce case</i>
<i>had come my way in weeks.</i>

06:02.336 --> 06:04.395
<i>And I wasn't the only one</i>
<i>going through a lull.</i>

06:04.472 --> 06:06.167
<i>T.C. 's chopper business</i>
<i>was down</i>

06:06.240 --> 06:07.434
<i>and the King Kamehameha Club</i>

06:07.508 --> 06:10.409
<i>had lost some members to</i>
<i>a rival club in Diamond Head.</i>

06:10.478 --> 06:12.173
<i>I intended to use</i>
<i>the extra time</i>

06:12.246 --> 06:14.407
<i>to keep myself</i>
<i>in some kind of shape.</i>

06:16.317 --> 06:19.878
<i>My friends were also spending</i>
<i>their time constructively.</i>

06:20.287 --> 06:21.276
No.

06:21.489 --> 06:22.922
The LZ was
north of the paddy.

06:22.990 --> 06:24.389
That's where
Froggy got lit up.

06:24.458 --> 06:26.756
Damn, T.C. I don't know how
you could have forgotten that.

06:26.827 --> 06:29.159
Orville,
don't write my biography.

06:29.230 --> 06:33.166
The LZ was east of the paddy
when we went in to get the team.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.729
Froggy didn't buy it until the
next day flying a dust-off.

06:36.804 --> 06:38.362
That's where he
first got lit up.

06:38.439 --> 06:39.633
The LZ was hot,
remember?

06:39.707 --> 06:40.833
Okay, let me guess.

06:40.908 --> 06:43.172
The pea is under that one.
Oh. Nope. Sorry.

06:43.244 --> 06:44.768
Very funny.

06:45.045 --> 06:47.707
Hey, listen, you remember when
we picked you up in Bihn Lat?

06:47.782 --> 06:50.376
Yeah, yeah, uh,
Froggy didn't buy it that day. Did he?

06:50.451 --> 06:51.679
Yes, he did.

06:51.752 --> 06:53.117
I don't believe you guys.

06:53.187 --> 06:55.417
Why don't you talk about
something a little more pleasant.

06:55.489 --> 06:57.150
Like the flu or taxes.

06:57.224 --> 06:58.486
How about
litigation?

06:58.559 --> 06:59.583
What?

06:59.660 --> 07:01.218
Magnum, has it ever occurred to you

07:01.295 --> 07:04.321
when you take your seaside strolls,
to leave a note on the door?

07:04.398 --> 07:05.626
It would make it
so much easier

07:05.699 --> 07:07.690
for process servers
to locate you.

07:07.768 --> 07:08.962
Process servers?

07:09.036 --> 07:11.231
A gentleman is waiting
in the guesthouse.

07:11.305 --> 07:12.738
He's a process server?

07:12.807 --> 07:13.831
Who's suing you?

07:13.908 --> 07:15.273
We can't afford this,
Thomas.

07:15.342 --> 07:17.139
Higgins,
why'd you let him in?

07:17.211 --> 07:19.236
I didn't say
he was a process server.

07:19.313 --> 07:21.076
I merely said that a
note would facilitate

07:21.148 --> 07:23.742
the inevitable process server
in finding you.

07:24.919 --> 07:26.716
Who's the guy
in the guesthouse?

07:26.787 --> 07:29.654
Oddly enough, I suppose
he's a prospective client.

07:30.057 --> 07:32.048
Thanks, Higgins.
Thanks a lot.

07:36.297 --> 07:37.286
All right.

07:37.364 --> 07:38.490
I say,

07:39.133 --> 07:40.464
Sebastopol.

07:41.602 --> 07:43.934
You've made a
slight error, though.

07:44.004 --> 07:48.202
The Russian artillery
was closer to the salient.

07:50.744 --> 07:51.904
There.

07:57.418 --> 07:59.750
<i>Higgins' little joke</i>
<i>hit too close to home.</i>

07:59.820 --> 08:02.755
<i>As a private investigator,</i>
<i>I had collected a few enemies</i>

08:02.823 --> 08:04.313
<i>and even more debts.</i>

08:04.391 --> 08:05.881
<i>It was the debts</i>
<i>that worried me.</i>

08:05.960 --> 08:08.258
<i>They tended to be</i>
<i>much more persistent.</i>

08:10.631 --> 08:12.326
Hi. Mr. Magnum?

08:12.399 --> 08:13.457
Yes.

08:15.803 --> 08:17.236
You are
a private investigator?

08:17.304 --> 08:18.601
Yes. Hi.

08:20.674 --> 08:22.403
You're wearing a swimsuit.

08:23.444 --> 08:26.504
Don't worry, I got
a whole closet full of pants.

08:26.580 --> 08:28.104
What can I do for you?

08:33.687 --> 08:37.817
"U.S. Sales representative
of Ekterberg Pharmaceuticals.

08:38.158 --> 08:39.784
Phoenix, Arizona."

08:43.530 --> 08:46.988
Are you, uh, upset about something,
Mr. Bjornson?

08:48.802 --> 08:50.997
No, Mr. Magnum.
I am not upset.

08:52.539 --> 08:55.269
But I am also
not Mr. Bjornson,

08:55.576 --> 08:58.568
Swedish, or a
pharmaceutical representative.

08:59.480 --> 09:03.246
Oh. Then why are you carrying
around these funny little cards?

09:03.717 --> 09:05.275
It is my cover.

09:06.253 --> 09:08.380
Courtesy of U.S.
Intelligence.

09:11.158 --> 09:13.888
My real name is Yuri Dolgov.

09:15.329 --> 09:19.663
I defected from the Soviet
Union a year ago in a MiG-30.

09:20.100 --> 09:22.432
Well, that's quite
a piece of hardware.

09:22.970 --> 09:26.428
I bet you there's a lot of people in
Moscow who aren't too fond of you.

09:26.540 --> 09:28.974
I am not here
to discuss myself.

09:31.312 --> 09:35.248
My fiancee is here in Hawaii
with a Soviet track team.

09:35.582 --> 09:37.709
She also wants to defect

09:38.252 --> 09:40.584
but the team is watched very closely.

09:41.288 --> 09:43.279
I cannot go to her,
they know me.

09:44.558 --> 09:46.287
I want you to help.

09:47.194 --> 09:48.991
Wait a minute.
Isn't this a little more

09:49.063 --> 09:50.621
for your friends
in the government?

09:51.131 --> 09:54.692
They will not help in the
defection of visiting athletes.

09:55.402 --> 09:57.597
It is considered bad manners.

09:58.539 --> 10:00.973
They will help
only afterwards.

10:01.942 --> 10:04.638
Let me ask you this:
Don't you think it's a little funny,

10:04.712 --> 10:06.680
the Soviets
letting her travel?

10:07.414 --> 10:09.575
She did only
the right things.

10:10.150 --> 10:13.142
She denounced me at party meetings on...
on television.

10:14.555 --> 10:18.082
Besides, they want her
to win gold medals.

10:20.094 --> 10:24.656
Mr. Magnum, do you have
an alcoholic beverage?

10:25.766 --> 10:27.666
I find this stressful.

10:28.068 --> 10:30.536
I'm sorry.
Um, Scotch?

10:31.238 --> 10:32.330
Do you have vodka?

10:32.406 --> 10:33.600
Brandy.

10:33.874 --> 10:35.774
Scotch will be
satisfactory.

10:35.909 --> 10:36.967
Ice?

10:37.711 --> 10:39.269
No. Never.

10:39.580 --> 10:42.140
<i>The little voice,</i>
<i>the one that tries to warn me,</i>

10:42.216 --> 10:44.343
<i>it was trying</i>
<i>to tell me something.</i>

10:44.418 --> 10:46.079
<i>I just didn't know what.</i>

10:46.420 --> 10:47.853
Here you go.

10:59.633 --> 11:02.864
Mr. Magnum,
when I defected,

11:03.270 --> 11:07.434
I left my country,
my... my language,

11:07.508 --> 11:09.032
even my identity.

11:09.676 --> 11:14.204
But now there is the possibility
to have my love with me.

11:15.949 --> 11:17.610
Can you understand that?

11:19.453 --> 11:20.511
Yes.

11:22.456 --> 11:23.855
Tell me this:

11:25.225 --> 11:28.092
Are you sure, though,
that she's ready to make this move?

11:28.162 --> 11:29.686
Of course!
She always wanted to!

11:29.763 --> 11:32.561
Just take it easy. I just don't
like getting egg on my face.

11:32.633 --> 11:33.964
We planned
everything together.

11:34.034 --> 11:35.433
The... the denunciations.
Everything.

11:35.502 --> 11:37.129
Okay, okay. That's fine.

11:40.707 --> 11:41.935
Wonderful.

11:43.377 --> 11:44.776
It will be very simple.

11:44.845 --> 11:46.710
I have already
devised a plan.

11:49.683 --> 11:51.048
Mr. Magnum,

11:51.852 --> 11:53.979
please do
put on your pants.

12:00.961 --> 12:03.486
<i>My little voice</i>
<i>still wasn't specific.</i>

12:03.564 --> 12:06.431
<i>Just sort of</i>
<i>generally suspicious.</i>

12:06.500 --> 12:09.731
<i>So, I checked Yuri out with a</i>
<i>buddy at Naval Intelligence.</i>

12:10.370 --> 12:12.429
<i>As far as I could tell,</i>
<i>he was legit.</i>

12:12.506 --> 12:14.269
<i>And so was his story.</i>

12:14.341 --> 12:17.174
<i>Unfortunately, the little</i>
<i>voice didn't shut up.</i>

12:18.178 --> 12:19.304
Over there.

12:27.855 --> 12:29.720
Will you
recognize her later?

12:29.790 --> 12:31.758
Who could forget?

12:34.294 --> 12:37.525
Over there on the right,
he's a KGB agent.

12:40.467 --> 12:42.196
How do you know?

12:42.402 --> 12:46.736
Only idiots and KGB would wear
a suit like that in Hawaii.

12:49.009 --> 12:50.840
There are probably
one or two more.

12:54.481 --> 12:55.812
Down there

12:55.949 --> 12:59.009
is the gate the athletes go
through to get to the showers.

12:59.086 --> 13:00.781
You can get to Nina there.

13:00.921 --> 13:02.650
Is she gonna
understand me?

13:03.290 --> 13:05.087
Her English
is very good.

13:07.261 --> 13:09.388
What if she
doesn't trust me?

13:14.101 --> 13:15.591
Show her this.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.731
All right.
You go wait in the car.

13:20.807 --> 13:23.105
I don't want
anybody seeing you.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.702
Nina.
I'm a friend of Yuri's.

13:59.780 --> 14:01.509
He sent me to get you.

14:01.582 --> 14:02.708
Nina. Nina.

14:02.783 --> 14:04.341
Do you understand?
Yuri?

14:04.418 --> 14:06.443
I'm here
to take you to him.

14:06.520 --> 14:08.351
Can I help you?

14:09.489 --> 14:11.150
Oh, yes. Yes, you can.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.783
I'm a big fan
of Miss Markova's.

14:12.859 --> 14:14.326
I saw her run
the last Olympics.

14:14.394 --> 14:15.588
Do you have a pen?

14:15.662 --> 14:16.890
I'd love to get
her autograph.

14:16.964 --> 14:19.091
It's not for me, really.
See, it's for my kids.

14:19.166 --> 14:20.394
<i>Who is this?</i>

14:20.467 --> 14:21.900
<i>I don't know.</i>

14:22.769 --> 14:24.794
The athletes are in training.

14:24.938 --> 14:26.997
You should not bother them.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.336
Oh, I don't want
to bother her.

14:28.408 --> 14:30.467
I just want her autograph.
Do you have a pen?

14:32.145 --> 14:33.169
Pencil
will do fine.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.441
You go now.

14:34.748 --> 14:36.716
My kids will be
real disappointed.

14:37.150 --> 14:38.549
Go away.

14:39.019 --> 14:40.577
Hey, what's
the big deal?

14:40.654 --> 14:42.281
I will call the guard.

14:42.422 --> 14:43.787
Okay.
That's not necessary.

14:43.857 --> 14:45.449
I just wanted
an autograph.

14:47.427 --> 14:49.725
<i>Come with me.</i>

16:04.853 --> 16:05.842
Where is she?

16:05.921 --> 16:08.082
I told you
to stay in the car.

16:08.157 --> 16:09.283
I couldn't wait.

16:09.358 --> 16:11.656
You couldn't wait?
What if somebody sees you?

16:11.727 --> 16:13.888
Magnum,
it's been over a year.

16:14.296 --> 16:15.285
I love her.

16:15.364 --> 16:16.888
You could have
loused everything up.

16:16.965 --> 16:18.296
Except she
beat you to it.

16:18.367 --> 16:19.391
What do you mean?

16:19.468 --> 16:21.493
Nina treated me like
I had the plague.

16:21.570 --> 16:23.367
She... she was
probably very frightened.

16:23.438 --> 16:25.998
Oh, that's terrific!
I feel much better.

16:26.675 --> 16:28.836
D- Don't worry.
I'll find another way to get to her.

16:28.911 --> 16:30.674
Why don't you get yourself
another boy?

16:30.746 --> 16:31.735
Why?

16:31.814 --> 16:34.044
Remember I told you I didn't
like getting egg on my face?

16:34.116 --> 16:36.243
Well, right now,
I'm wearing a whole omelet.

16:36.318 --> 16:37.751
That is no reason
to quit.

16:37.820 --> 16:39.219
All right,
I'll give you a reason.

16:39.288 --> 16:40.448
I'll give you
three reasons.

16:40.522 --> 16:42.251
Number 1:
It was a lousy plan.

16:42.324 --> 16:43.518
You had us
out in the open.

16:43.592 --> 16:45.651
Number 2:
You didn't do what I told you.

16:47.062 --> 16:50.429
Number 3: You're probably
barking up the wrong tree.

16:52.467 --> 16:54.958
She is not
the wrong tree!

17:00.042 --> 17:04.001
Lmpotence! I hate impotence!

17:05.681 --> 17:06.739
Hey.

17:24.933 --> 17:26.594
American garbage.

17:27.803 --> 17:29.327
Full of plastic.

17:31.573 --> 17:33.837
Tell me something.
Why'd you do it?

17:35.344 --> 17:36.743
What?
Defect.

17:37.112 --> 17:39.342
You said you gave up a lot.
Why'd you do it?

17:43.919 --> 17:45.443
I ate too much.

17:47.289 --> 17:48.415
What?

17:50.025 --> 17:52.619
If you eat too much,
it comes back up.

17:52.861 --> 17:54.226
I ate too much.

17:55.464 --> 17:56.692
Too much

17:57.532 --> 18:00.433
political indoctrination,
too many lies.

18:01.136 --> 18:03.934
Too many hours standing
in lines for this, for that.

18:07.075 --> 18:08.440
The trouble is

18:09.211 --> 18:11.270
I forgot about
the good things.

18:12.180 --> 18:13.647
Things I would miss.

18:14.983 --> 18:18.009
People, faces, smells.

18:21.189 --> 18:22.622
I spend time,

18:24.526 --> 18:26.016
a lot of time,

18:27.329 --> 18:28.921
thinking about it.

18:31.433 --> 18:32.866
Wish you hadn't done it?

18:34.403 --> 18:35.734
Sometimes.

18:37.272 --> 18:38.671
But then I remember

18:39.308 --> 18:40.900
when I was a child
there was something

18:40.976 --> 18:42.603
I wanted to do.
It was impossible.

18:42.678 --> 18:44.475
To see the Grand Canyon.

18:44.546 --> 18:46.980
Last month I saw
the Grand Canyon.

18:47.449 --> 18:50.043
It was more beautiful
than in my imagination.

18:53.221 --> 18:54.415
Magnum,

18:55.691 --> 18:56.953
two days.

18:57.659 --> 18:59.422
Then the track team leaves.

19:00.729 --> 19:02.856
That's all I have
to get her.

19:08.503 --> 19:10.664
You let me make
the plan this time.

19:19.781 --> 19:22.750
Come on, T.C.
How am I supposed to brief us?

19:22.818 --> 19:25.548
Will you get that
out of my face, please?

19:26.054 --> 19:28.488
Hold on, hold on.
I think I'm getting it.

19:28.557 --> 19:30.388
Thomas, can't you just
show us the pictures?

19:30.459 --> 19:31.983
They're not pictures.
They're slides.

19:32.060 --> 19:34.187
I thought it'd be easier.
You know, more professional.

19:34.262 --> 19:36.025
But I didn't know
Thomas Alva Edison here

19:36.098 --> 19:37.725
would have trouble
with the equipment.

19:37.799 --> 19:41.394
Okay. Here we go.
Here we go. Try it now.

19:42.838 --> 19:44.066
Oh, come on, T.C.

19:44.139 --> 19:46.699
Is it too much to ask to
get my slides right side up?

19:46.775 --> 19:49.539
Minor problem,
minor problem. Not to worry.

19:49.611 --> 19:52.444
I forgot what a nasty CO
you can be.

19:53.181 --> 19:56.173
Okay, there.

19:57.285 --> 19:58.377
Thank you.

19:58.754 --> 20:01.689
Now, the athletes are staying
at the Quilliam Hotel.

20:01.757 --> 20:03.725
They are housed
in the llimi wing.

20:03.792 --> 20:06.852
Now, Nina is in a cottage,
uh, number 114.

20:06.928 --> 20:08.190
We'll have to
get to her there.

20:08.263 --> 20:12.290
Um, T.M., did you come up with
this plan all by your lonesome?

20:12.567 --> 20:13.727
Yeah. What's the matter?

20:13.802 --> 20:16.327
I don't know.
Well, I don't know yet.

20:17.205 --> 20:18.900
I just keep remembering
the plan you had

20:18.974 --> 20:21.704
to get all of the POW's
out of Cambodia.

20:21.910 --> 20:23.434
T.C., there is no comparison

20:23.512 --> 20:25.707
between that plan
and this one.

20:25.781 --> 20:27.146
I hope not.

20:27.215 --> 20:29.149
I don't need
anymore scars.

20:29.217 --> 20:31.242
Come on. Will you just
pay attention, please?

20:31.319 --> 20:33.219
I'm all ears and eyes.

20:33.288 --> 20:36.086
Now, there are at least
two Soviet agents

20:36.158 --> 20:38.388
acting as watchdogs and
traveling with the Soviet team.

20:38.460 --> 20:40.985
They'll have to be diverted.
But in a nonviolent manner.

20:41.063 --> 20:44.396
We don't want to create any more of an
international incident than we have to.

20:44.466 --> 20:46.764
Great. What about a little
international incident?

20:47.836 --> 20:49.929
This is Kalugin.
He's the muscle.

20:50.005 --> 20:51.973
He spends most of his time
at the pool

20:52.040 --> 20:53.871
trying to keep track
of the other athletes.

20:54.976 --> 20:56.136
This is Tarasov.

20:56.211 --> 20:59.476
He's registered as a representative
of the Ministry of Sports.

20:59.548 --> 21:01.015
Now, I think
he's the head man.

21:01.083 --> 21:02.778
He spends most of his time in his room,

21:02.851 --> 21:05.115
but he does make spot
checks on the athletes.

21:05.620 --> 21:09.386
Now, I think that
there's a third agent.

21:10.659 --> 21:14.652
I call him the Turk.
Just seemed appropriate.

21:14.729 --> 21:17.095
I just thought it up
while I was casing.

21:17.432 --> 21:20.162
Anyway, there's no record
of him with the Soviet team.

21:20.235 --> 21:22.066
But I'm sure he's involved
in surveillance.

21:22.137 --> 21:24.196
He has kind of a
trenchcoat-air about him.

21:24.272 --> 21:25.330
We got to
watch out for him.

21:25.407 --> 21:27.500
Also, we got to watch out
for the other athletes

21:27.576 --> 21:29.976
'cause a lot of them
are informers. Okay.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.310
Okay, guys.
Come over here.

21:34.449 --> 21:35.541
Why?

21:36.118 --> 21:38.245
Because this is the plan,
that's why.

21:38.820 --> 21:41.721
Uh, just one question,
sir.

21:42.257 --> 21:43.246
Yeah?

21:43.325 --> 21:46.852
Uh, you just showed us two
guys that we have to divert?

21:46.928 --> 21:47.917
Right.

21:48.130 --> 21:51.327
And then we need one guy
to get the girl out.

21:51.399 --> 21:52.366
That's right.

21:52.434 --> 21:53.696
Then we need

21:53.768 --> 21:55.895
a point man for
this Turk dude.

21:55.971 --> 21:57.768
That's exactly correct.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.970
Oh, the way I figure it,
that leaves us one man short.

22:01.042 --> 22:02.771
Funny you should
mention short.

22:28.436 --> 22:30.666
Gee, Higgins,
can I play, too?

22:31.840 --> 22:33.705
This is hardly a game,
Magnum.

22:34.142 --> 22:35.871
Well,
you could have fooled me.

22:35.977 --> 22:37.376
Toy soldiers,

22:37.445 --> 22:39.743
toy horses,
toy carnage.

22:41.249 --> 22:44.218
This is a faithful reproduction
of the Battle of Austerlitz.

22:44.286 --> 22:47.312
I'm lecturing on it at the
Hawaiian Napoleonic Society.

22:47.389 --> 22:50.586
Oh, of course.
That's every other Wednesday, isn't it?

22:51.560 --> 22:53.551
It's the first Tuesday
of every month.

22:53.628 --> 22:54.788
Oh. Ooh!

22:55.697 --> 22:58.097
Is this
the little general himself?

22:59.834 --> 23:02.428
That's General Kutuzov.
And I wish you'd put him down.

23:05.240 --> 23:08.300
You're quite a student of tactics,
aren't you, Higgins?

23:12.147 --> 23:14.377
Strategy and tactics,
yes.

23:15.183 --> 23:16.616
What do you want, Magnum?

23:16.685 --> 23:18.846
Oh, I need you to help me
with a case.

23:18.920 --> 23:19.944
Me?

23:21.957 --> 23:24.482
Magnum, you know how I feel
about your work.

23:24.693 --> 23:27.321
Yeah.
I need you to talk to a guy at a hotel.

23:28.930 --> 23:30.659
You haven't got
a prayer.

23:34.569 --> 23:35.763
Why me?

23:36.371 --> 23:40.398
Uh, I need a special kind
of conversationalist.

23:40.475 --> 23:41.533
A scholar.

23:41.610 --> 23:44.579
You're the only guy
I can think of.

23:45.580 --> 23:47.343
Does this business
fall anywhere

23:47.415 --> 23:48.882
within the parameters
of the law?

23:48.950 --> 23:49.882
Absolutely.

23:49.951 --> 23:51.851
And it's important to you?
Very.

23:52.654 --> 23:55.555
Then you would be willing to
negotiate for my participation?

23:55.624 --> 23:57.091
Not in the least.
Good.

23:57.859 --> 24:00.327
We'll start with your use
of the hot tub.

24:01.129 --> 24:02.323
What did you say?

24:02.397 --> 24:03.523
Not in the least.

24:03.598 --> 24:04.963
Good night, Magnum.

24:05.033 --> 24:06.625
Ah, of course...

24:07.435 --> 24:10.734
Oh, Higgins, you served in
Vienna after the war, didn't you?

24:10.805 --> 24:13.672
I was liaison to the Soviet
Army of occupation, yes.

24:15.543 --> 24:16.840
You know that?

24:16.911 --> 24:20.847
Yeah, they kind of pushed you around
a little, didn't they? The Russians?

24:21.049 --> 24:23.813
Made you hand over defectors,
POW's?

24:24.586 --> 24:26.986
I hate to think of what
happened to those poor people.

24:27.055 --> 24:28.613
The Soviets were
our allies then.

24:28.690 --> 24:30.555
We were carrying out
national policy.

24:31.159 --> 24:33.593
Yeah, I know.
How'd you feel about it?

24:34.062 --> 24:37.395
Magnum, a soldier often has to
do things that are disagreeable.

24:38.066 --> 24:41.035
Yeah, there's disagreeable,
and there's disagreeable.

24:41.336 --> 24:42.826
It was loathsome

24:43.305 --> 24:45.535
and I shall
never forgive them.

24:46.241 --> 24:47.833
Are you satisfied?

24:47.909 --> 24:49.672
How'd you like
to get even?

24:56.284 --> 24:58.275
<i>It had been a long time</i>
<i>since I said,</i>

24:58.353 --> 25:00.287
<i>"Let's synchronize watches."</i>

25:00.355 --> 25:03.620
<i>And it gave me absolutely no</i>
<i>thrill to say it this morning.</i>

25:03.892 --> 25:05.621
<i>I still had</i>
<i>an uneasy feeling,</i>

25:05.694 --> 25:08.026
<i>despite all the work</i>
<i>I'd put into this.</i>

25:08.096 --> 25:10.496
<i>Something just</i>
<i>didn't feel right.</i>

25:10.565 --> 25:14.001
<i>My client, on the other hand,</i>
<i>was very pleased with things.</i>

25:14.969 --> 25:16.698
I don't like it
at all.

25:17.339 --> 25:19.500
Everyone has something
to do but me.

25:19.574 --> 25:20.836
Look...
All I do is sit!

25:20.909 --> 25:22.706
Stay put this time,
will you?

25:22.777 --> 25:24.904
I don't like even
getting you this close.

25:24.979 --> 25:27.812
Well, I wasn't going to
just sit at home and wait!

25:28.850 --> 25:31.114
Ah. Impotence!

25:32.687 --> 25:36.418
Look, I know you hate it.
Just don't kick anything, will you?

25:40.495 --> 25:43.020
I'm afraid
that, uh, sometimes

25:43.098 --> 25:45.464
I'm imprudent.

25:47.168 --> 25:49.500
It caused me much trouble
with the military.

25:50.905 --> 25:52.998
Well, I can understand that.

25:54.409 --> 25:56.536
I could have been
much happier in life

25:56.611 --> 25:58.704
if I would have
been more prudent.

25:58.780 --> 25:59.872
Yeah.

26:00.515 --> 26:02.608
Listen, this will all
be over in a few minutes.

26:02.684 --> 26:05.152
I want you to just try
and relax, okay, Yuri?

26:05.220 --> 26:06.482
Take it easy.

26:08.790 --> 26:09.984
Magnum.

26:14.896 --> 26:16.193
Thank you.

26:52.601 --> 26:54.068
Uh, excuse me.

26:54.269 --> 26:57.761
Uh, they said at the desk that, uh,
you're with the Soviet track team.

26:57.839 --> 26:58.771
Yes.

26:58.840 --> 26:59.829
Splendid.

27:00.075 --> 27:01.099
The name's Lovelace.

27:01.176 --> 27:03.542
I'm with the Honolulu
Institute for Marxist Studies.

27:03.612 --> 27:06.513
I've been quite anxious to
chat with a Soviet citizen.

27:06.581 --> 27:07.980
Do you mind?

27:08.116 --> 27:09.140
Ah?

27:09.217 --> 27:13.176
You are conversant with
Socialist theory, are you not?

27:13.755 --> 27:14.847
What?

27:15.257 --> 27:17.248
Socialism.
Uh, communism.

27:17.926 --> 27:19.223
Are you
a party member?

27:19.294 --> 27:21.091
Yes. Of course.

27:21.163 --> 27:22.221
Good.

27:22.297 --> 27:25.323
You see, some of us at the Institute
have been having a little argument.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.630
Uh, perhaps you can
set it straight.

27:27.936 --> 27:29.403
I don't understand.

27:29.471 --> 27:30.768
Well, it's quite simple.

27:30.839 --> 27:33.000
According to
Marxist dialectics,

27:33.074 --> 27:36.703
gradual social progress can never
lead to anything worthwhile. Yes?

27:37.445 --> 27:38.935
Reforms
constitute progress

27:39.014 --> 27:41.710
only if they operate as a foreign
body in the existing system

27:41.783 --> 27:44.411
thereby accelerating
decline. Is that not so?

27:44.519 --> 27:45.543
Uh?

27:46.121 --> 27:47.281
Yes, of course.

27:47.355 --> 27:48.344
The question is

27:48.423 --> 27:50.914
how does Marx reconcile
dialectic philosophy

27:50.992 --> 27:53.688
with his own economic
interpretation of history?

27:53.762 --> 27:54.854
I beg your pardon?

27:54.930 --> 27:56.056
Poor guy.

27:57.566 --> 27:58.931
Okay, Rick,
you're up.

28:00.335 --> 28:01.324
Okay.

28:01.937 --> 28:03.370
Pay the check.

28:04.639 --> 28:05.833
Did you hear that?

28:05.907 --> 28:07.204
Oh, yeah.

28:11.913 --> 28:14.211
Hey, man. Wait a minute.
I didn't even buy a drink.

28:14.282 --> 28:16.250
What am I doing
paying the check?

28:35.904 --> 28:37.428
What are you doing?

28:37.839 --> 28:41.036
Hey, is this that shot-putter's room,
Olga Sankina?

28:41.843 --> 28:44.073
And, uh,
who are you?

28:44.412 --> 28:47.108
I'm a reporter with
<i>The Honolulu Night Lighter.</i>

28:47.549 --> 28:50.450
What do you want
from Miss, uh, Sankina?

28:50.919 --> 28:53.820
You see, that's just it.
She ain't a miss at all.

28:53.888 --> 28:55.082
We got
the doctor's report.

28:55.156 --> 28:57.989
She's got too many chromosomes or,
I don't know, maybe not enough.

28:58.059 --> 28:59.321
But all I know is this.

28:59.394 --> 29:01.191
She's this far
from being a mister.

29:02.564 --> 29:03.895
That's ridiculous.

29:03.965 --> 29:06.627
Yeah? Well, um, why don't we
just ask Olga about it, huh?

29:06.701 --> 29:11.001
You can't annoy the
athletes with this nonsense.

29:11.606 --> 29:13.267
The hell I can't.

29:14.976 --> 29:16.204
Go away from here.

29:16.278 --> 29:18.109
You ever hear
of the First Amendment?

29:18.179 --> 29:20.647
Yeah, you can discuss it
with hotel security.

29:20.715 --> 29:22.012
Come on,
let go of me, will you?

29:22.083 --> 29:24.051
I intend to.
I intend to.

29:25.520 --> 29:26.509
Let's go.

29:33.228 --> 29:36.026
Listen, we got to be careful.
Her roommate might come back.

29:36.097 --> 29:37.121
We need a code?

29:37.198 --> 29:39.029
No, you just
get rid of her.

29:39.100 --> 29:40.328
That's easy
for you to say.

29:44.706 --> 29:45.695
What do you want?

29:45.774 --> 29:47.401
You remember me?
Yuri sent me.

29:47.475 --> 29:49.204
Go away.
Terrific.

29:49.311 --> 29:51.040
I know
you're frightened.

29:51.246 --> 29:52.304
Go, please.

29:52.380 --> 29:54.541
I never should've
went in on this.

29:55.183 --> 29:56.172
Here.

29:56.685 --> 29:57.913
Oh, God.

30:04.326 --> 30:05.725
Where is he?

30:06.528 --> 30:08.052
He's outside.
Waiting.

30:08.129 --> 30:09.721
Go. You must go.

30:10.098 --> 30:12.066
Nina, we came to
take you out of here.

30:12.133 --> 30:14.624
No. You must go
before someone's coming.

30:15.503 --> 30:17.869
Nina, look, I have gone
through a lot of trouble here.

30:17.939 --> 30:19.497
Yuri said
you wanted this.

30:19.574 --> 30:20.802
I don't.

30:21.643 --> 30:24.578
I knew it. I knew it.
How can I be such a sucker?

30:24.646 --> 30:25.635
Wait.

30:27.549 --> 30:30.643
You don't know these people.
I will never get out of here.

30:30.719 --> 30:33.210
You will if you want to.
I've taken care of things.

30:33.288 --> 30:35.586
They know who you are.
They saw you at the track.

30:35.657 --> 30:37.124
It will never work.

30:37.192 --> 30:38.853
Okay. Fine.
It will never work!

30:38.927 --> 30:41.157
Next time, I'll listen
to that little voice...

30:41.229 --> 30:42.719
Wait. Wait.

30:49.404 --> 30:52.805
You're asking me to make a
decision that can't be changed.

30:53.775 --> 30:54.764
Nina?

30:55.643 --> 30:57.770
I'm not asking you
to do anything.

30:59.514 --> 31:01.573
I don't know
what's out there.

31:01.649 --> 31:03.378
Can you understand?

31:04.486 --> 31:06.647
I don't know
what will be my life.

31:06.721 --> 31:08.348
You'll have Yuri.

31:08.890 --> 31:11.085
Does that still
mean something?

31:15.263 --> 31:16.252
Let's go.

31:29.110 --> 31:30.839
What is it?
One of your teammates.

31:38.186 --> 31:39.483
Psst! Come on!

31:50.665 --> 31:52.860
You're gonna hear about this,
pal. This ain't Russia.

31:52.934 --> 31:54.265
You can't stifle
the press here!

31:54.335 --> 31:57.361
We have rights in this country,
you pickle, bimbo, you!

31:58.840 --> 32:00.398
How fortunate
that in your country

32:00.475 --> 32:02.773
scandalmongers
are not permitted.

32:03.144 --> 32:05.305
But to return
to my earlier point,

32:05.380 --> 32:08.543
if communism is a historical
inevitability, as Marx believed...

32:15.657 --> 32:17.955
I guess I better go
warn Higgins, huh?

32:42.150 --> 32:44.448
Hold it.
I said, hold it!

32:46.588 --> 32:48.146
I'm the house detective.

32:48.289 --> 32:49.881
Now, what's going on here?

32:49.958 --> 32:51.721
The house detective?
That's terrific.

32:51.793 --> 32:53.784
Don't give me that
"terrific," hotshot.

32:53.862 --> 32:55.591
I've been eyeing
this situation.

32:55.663 --> 32:56.755
Now what's going on?

32:56.831 --> 32:59.823
There's... There's really
nothing to be alarmed about.

32:59.901 --> 33:01.459
Then why are you
sneaking around?

33:01.536 --> 33:03.026
Well, if you want
to know the truth,

33:03.104 --> 33:04.765
we're not exactly married

33:04.839 --> 33:07.034
and there are some people
out front and if they saw us

33:07.108 --> 33:09.338
it wouldn't look too good,
you know what I mean?

33:09.410 --> 33:11.071
You're one of them Russians
aren't you?

33:11.145 --> 33:14.205
Look, couldn't we settle this with
a little green piece of paper.

33:14.282 --> 33:16.842
You now, the kind with Andrew
Jackson's picture on it?

33:17.252 --> 33:20.016
Ma'am, is he making you do
something against your will?

33:20.088 --> 33:21.885
We don't have to
put up with this, dear.

33:21.956 --> 33:23.321
Something depraved?

33:23.491 --> 33:24.890
This is ridiculous!

33:24.959 --> 33:26.824
Well, let's see
some ID.

33:26.995 --> 33:28.462
What do we do?

33:28.596 --> 33:30.655
You explain yourselves,
that's what you do.

33:30.732 --> 33:32.290
Now, let's see
some ID!

33:33.134 --> 33:34.396
All right.

33:34.602 --> 33:37.833
Um, get my wallet in your purse, dear.
I think it's right there...

33:40.008 --> 33:41.236
Is he all right?

33:41.309 --> 33:44.801
He just won't be eating any solid
foods for a while, that's all. Come on.

33:44.879 --> 33:46.870
Of course, I think
Marx went a bit far,

33:46.948 --> 33:49.678
saying the classes have
no common interests at all.

33:49.751 --> 33:51.810
Religion,
patriotism

33:53.187 --> 33:55.747
can't, uh,
be dismissed out of hand.

33:56.658 --> 33:58.558
Well, uh,
I must be off.

33:58.793 --> 34:02.024
I can't tell you how fascinating
it's been listening to your opinions.

34:02.096 --> 34:03.324
Goodbye.

34:03.665 --> 34:04.654
And, uh...

34:15.643 --> 34:16.768
Where's Yuri?

34:16.844 --> 34:19.608
Where is he? Where is he?
What's happened?

34:25.520 --> 34:26.953
<i>I finally figured out</i>

34:27.021 --> 34:29.581
<i>what the little voice</i>
<i>was trying to tell me.</i>

34:31.942 --> 34:34.103
I knew something was off
the whole time.

34:34.177 --> 34:35.667
L... I just smelled it.

34:35.746 --> 34:37.407
How could I be so damn blind?

34:37.481 --> 34:40.143
Easy. The same way
you were in Cambodia.

34:40.217 --> 34:41.275
I knew it! I knew it!

34:41.351 --> 34:43.444
It was just staring me
right in the face.

34:43.520 --> 34:45.385
Your strategy overlooked
the larger picture.

34:45.455 --> 34:47.753
I am aware of that,
Higgins! Thank you.

34:48.891 --> 34:51.257
Did it ever cross your mind
that Nina was only bait?

34:51.328 --> 34:52.795
No, Higgins,
it didn't!

34:52.862 --> 34:55.592
Some things didn't cross his
mind in Cambodia, either. T.C.

34:55.665 --> 34:57.428
What are they gonna
do to him, Higgins?

34:57.501 --> 35:01.164
Well, first they'll find out how
much he's told the Americans.

35:01.238 --> 35:03.035
Then they'll use him
for propaganda.

35:03.106 --> 35:05.233
Parade him around.
Say he came back on his own.

35:05.308 --> 35:07.037
Couldn't stand
the decadent west.

35:07.144 --> 35:09.203
After they've
made their points...

35:09.613 --> 35:11.581
Well, I shudder to think.

35:12.516 --> 35:14.450
You really were
very shortsighted, Magnum.

35:14.518 --> 35:16.816
I know, Higgins.
I played it like an amateur.

35:16.887 --> 35:18.878
Look, what we got to do
is find Yuri

35:18.955 --> 35:20.946
before they ship him
out of Hawaii.

35:21.024 --> 35:23.254
Don't you think you've
bungled this enough as it is?

35:23.326 --> 35:26.193
Higgins, he's my client.
My responsibility!

35:26.730 --> 35:28.425
Besides that, I like him.

35:28.498 --> 35:30.022
He's imprudent.

35:30.300 --> 35:31.995
Besides that, I'm mad!

35:32.536 --> 35:33.696
Real mad.

35:33.770 --> 35:37.866
Hey, easy, man. When you get
mad, you have a tendency
to put us all in the soup.

35:37.941 --> 35:40.307
Magnum, this isn't a matter
for a private investigator.

35:40.377 --> 35:42.004
It should be turned over
to the FBI.

35:42.078 --> 35:44.205
Higgins, It's too late
for that. I know them.

35:44.281 --> 35:46.374
By the time they interview us,
file a report,

35:46.449 --> 35:47.973
and get instructions
from Washington,

35:48.051 --> 35:49.143
Yuri will be in Moscow.

35:49.219 --> 35:50.652
Now, we can't let that happen.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.813
Uh-oh. He's mad, all right.

36:42.873 --> 36:44.340
Where's Yuri?

36:45.775 --> 36:48.141
I don't know what
you're talking about.

36:49.579 --> 36:51.046
Where's Yuri?

36:52.449 --> 36:53.916
I demand to speak

36:53.984 --> 36:56.919
to an official representative
of the Soviet embassy.

36:57.988 --> 37:02.322
I am from
the Ministry of Sports.

37:03.059 --> 37:05.584
How are you getting him
out of Hawaii?

37:07.664 --> 37:08.995
Untie me!

37:12.669 --> 37:14.466
I'll do whatever I have to.

37:15.238 --> 37:17.331
This is not how
things are done.

37:17.908 --> 37:19.341
There are rules.

37:20.143 --> 37:22.634
You... you... you
can't kidnap me.

37:23.780 --> 37:26.180
We can do the same
to your people.

37:26.783 --> 37:29.445
Oh, I'm not with
American Intelligence.

37:30.387 --> 37:32.719
I'm independent. No rules.

37:35.625 --> 37:38.253
You don't expect me
to believe that.

37:39.396 --> 37:41.159
I work strictly
for cash.

37:41.531 --> 37:43.624
And you have the only man
who can pay me.

37:44.601 --> 37:46.228
Now where is he?

37:46.469 --> 37:47.493
You won't shoot me.

37:51.074 --> 37:52.439
Now, where is he?

39:37.514 --> 39:39.038
Take your time.

40:18.388 --> 40:20.151
Oh, great.

40:34.838 --> 40:36.703
Well, let's
open her up.

40:37.340 --> 40:39.137
They'll be
here soon.

41:09.806 --> 41:11.205
What's going on?

41:19.182 --> 41:20.308
Who's that?

41:39.302 --> 41:41.600
I'll go see what he wants.
You check in here.

41:41.671 --> 41:42.797
Okay.

42:24.547 --> 42:26.174
What do you want?

42:26.482 --> 42:28.211
There's been a change!

42:28.384 --> 42:29.476
What?

42:30.153 --> 42:32.144
There's been a change!

42:32.455 --> 42:33.888
Who are you?

42:34.490 --> 42:35.616
What?

42:36.025 --> 42:37.788
I said, who are you?

42:42.098 --> 42:44.658
Come a little closer,
I can't hear you!

42:46.636 --> 42:48.604
They've rerouted
the drop!

42:48.671 --> 42:50.536
Who rerouted the drop?

42:50.773 --> 42:51.933
Moscow!

42:52.008 --> 42:53.532
Where do we go?

42:54.777 --> 42:55.766
What?

42:56.112 --> 42:58.012
Where do we go?

42:58.414 --> 43:00.382
To another pier on Kailua.

43:00.883 --> 43:01.872
Same
procedure?

43:01.951 --> 43:03.179
Exactly.

43:03.586 --> 43:05.178
What about the boat?

43:05.255 --> 43:07.223
They should be there now.

43:09.459 --> 43:11.984
Hey, wait a minute.
But there's the boat.

43:35.418 --> 43:37.852
Come on, Rick.
Let's go. Come on!

44:48.424 --> 44:49.618
Hurry up.

45:29.265 --> 45:32.132
It is eminently satisfying,
Magnum,

45:32.201 --> 45:34.533
to know that
as a result of this,

45:34.804 --> 45:37.102
a few heads will roll
in Moscow.

45:38.875 --> 45:41.844
You know,
when I was in Vienna,

45:42.011 --> 45:44.639
the Soviets tried to
recruit me as an agent.

45:44.714 --> 45:46.443
Unbelievably crude.

45:46.582 --> 45:49.915
I came home one night to find
a naked woman in my bed.

45:49.986 --> 45:51.886
I knew immediately
she was Russian.

45:51.954 --> 45:55.583
They use stainless steel
instead of gold.

45:57.760 --> 45:59.557
Magnum, what are you doing?

46:00.596 --> 46:04.191
Well, with all this
talk about strategy.

46:04.634 --> 46:07.535
It's made me think about
a skirmish that I was in.

46:07.603 --> 46:11.061
We had to hold our line against
an enemy force our own size.

46:11.140 --> 46:12.129
Hmm?

46:12.308 --> 46:13.832
What was the terrain?

46:13.910 --> 46:15.537
It was a level open field.

46:16.145 --> 46:17.612
Weather conditions?

46:18.147 --> 46:20.012
It was clear. But, uh,

46:20.349 --> 46:22.010
it had rained
the night before.

46:22.084 --> 46:24.484
I remember the ground
was pretty muddy.

46:25.888 --> 46:29.221
I see they tried to flank your right
side with a two-pronged attack.

46:29.292 --> 46:30.281
Yeah.

46:30.359 --> 46:32.884
You kept further reserves
in the rear, flexible lines,

46:32.962 --> 46:34.395
good communications.

46:35.331 --> 46:37.060
Very sound deployment.

46:37.867 --> 46:39.300
That's what we thought.

46:40.102 --> 46:41.433
What happened?

46:41.504 --> 46:43.768
They broke through
just the same.

46:44.106 --> 46:46.165
I felt responsible.
It was my plan.

46:46.242 --> 46:49.439
Look here, Magnum,
the burden of command is never light.

46:49.512 --> 46:52.037
But someone has to lead.
I'm sure you did your best.

46:52.114 --> 46:53.411
I suppose.

46:54.183 --> 46:56.777
But a touchdown so soon
in the first quarter.

46:58.054 --> 46:59.021
What?

46:59.088 --> 47:01.750
It was the Army-Navy game.
I was team captain.

47:03.693 --> 47:05.718
This was just
a football game?

47:06.195 --> 47:08.095
It wasn't just
a football game, Higgins.

47:08.164 --> 47:10.029
It was the Army-Navy game.

47:12.735 --> 47:13.929
Higgins?

47:14.504 --> 47:16.233
Is something wrong?
