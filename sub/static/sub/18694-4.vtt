WEBVTT

00:05.159 --> 00:07.360
BOY: Come on, Mom!
Faster.

00:07.395 --> 00:09.362
It's not gonna setup by itself.

00:09.397 --> 00:11.497
That's the thing, Declan.

00:11.532 --> 00:13.032
If you would help...

00:13.067 --> 00:14.033
Mom!

00:14.068 --> 00:16.869
I'm sorry.

00:16.904 --> 00:19.572
Crap. There's
another party.

00:19.607 --> 00:22.174
Not for long. I reserved
this space, and if they think

00:22.210 --> 00:25.311
that they're gonna stay here,
I'm gonna give them a piece...

00:25.346 --> 00:27.246
(screaming)

00:27.282 --> 00:29.315
Jeez, Mom, that's how
you tell someone off?

00:29.350 --> 00:31.350
(woman screaming)

00:31.386 --> 00:33.419
(both screaming)

00:33.454 --> 00:36.222
(rats squeaking)

00:36.257 --> 00:38.636
BOTH: <i>I told Christine that</i>
<i>we're checking out a new library.</i>

00:38.660 --> 00:41.027
I hope she's not
too disappointed

00:41.062 --> 00:42.962
when we take her to
the water park instead.

00:42.997 --> 00:46.565
Are you kidding me?
97 slides, four waterfalls,

00:46.601 --> 00:48.267
and the biggest dunkinator
in the state.

00:48.303 --> 00:51.604
(laughs) I'm very much
looking forward to it.

00:51.639 --> 00:53.317
Tell you, I was kind
of surprised about that.

00:53.341 --> 00:55.141
So, what, we'll hit up
Go-Kart World next?

00:55.176 --> 00:57.777
No. Go-kart tracks
are not known

00:57.812 --> 01:00.446
for their high concentration
of fecal matter.

01:00.481 --> 01:04.550
What, there's...
fecal matter in water parks?

01:04.584 --> 01:06.452
They're known for it.

01:06.487 --> 01:09.722
And studies show
that early exposure

01:09.757 --> 01:11.857
to E. coli bacteria is

01:11.893 --> 01:14.004
beneficial to the development
of children's immune systems.

01:14.028 --> 01:17.917
Fecal matter, like,
you know, poop, poo-poo?

01:17.918 --> 01:19.818
The longer we stay,
the more there will be.

01:19.853 --> 01:21.553
You know what?
I'll tell you what.

01:21.588 --> 01:23.433
I think it's, uh... I think
we should head to the library.

01:23.457 --> 01:24.967
Looks like the weather's
gonna change and... (phone ringing)

01:24.991 --> 01:26.424
Hmm. Oh.

01:26.460 --> 01:28.226
Oh, this is yours.

01:28.261 --> 01:29.828
This is mine.
(beeps)

01:29.863 --> 01:31.774
Oh, look at that. Body was found
in Rock Creek Park.

01:31.798 --> 01:33.631
We should get there ASAP.

01:33.667 --> 01:34.577
Well, I'm sure
Aubrey can cover for you.

01:34.601 --> 01:35.668
Nope, not this time.

01:35.669 --> 01:37.102
- Why?
- Why?

01:37.137 --> 01:39.037
'Cause it's, uh,
very important.

01:39.072 --> 01:41.506
My text says nothing about that.
That's because

01:41.541 --> 01:44.109
it's very important we'll get
your dad to take the kids

01:44.144 --> 01:47.045
to the library
and go read a book.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.613
Books are good
for the soul.

01:48.648 --> 01:51.116
Livor mortis on
the remaining tissue indicates

01:51.151 --> 01:53.918
the victim's been dead
ten to 12 hours.

01:53.954 --> 01:55.787
Why the balloons?
BOOTH: Well, 101, Aubrey.

01:55.822 --> 01:58.123
To make sure the body's found
sooner versus later.

01:58.158 --> 02:01.092
Yeah. Got no I.D. on the corpse.
Also, it's fresh.

02:01.128 --> 02:02.894
Checked with missing
persons. No one

02:02.929 --> 02:04.996
reported in the last 12 hours.
BRENNAN: There's no

02:05.031 --> 02:08.767
evidence of any blood
in the vicinity of the remains.

02:08.801 --> 02:11.047
And not in the corpse, either.
It's largely exsanguinated.

02:11.071 --> 02:13.282
BOOTH: Well, the victim was killed
somewhere else and taken here.

02:13.306 --> 02:15.184
I mean, look at the drag marks
that lead right out to the parking lot.

02:15.208 --> 02:16.853
AUBREY: Well, I got a schematic
from the ranger.

02:16.877 --> 02:20.545
Turns out that's the one lot
in the park with no cameras.

02:20.580 --> 02:22.747
Well, either the killer got
lucky, or he planned ahead.

02:22.783 --> 02:24.227
My informed guess is
that it's the latter.

02:24.251 --> 02:25.083
BRENNAN:
Size of the mandibular

02:25.118 --> 02:26.317
rami indicates

02:26.353 --> 02:27.719
the victim is male.

02:27.754 --> 02:29.487
Yeah, and the gums
are in bad shape.

02:29.523 --> 02:32.824
Interproximal attachment loss
is typical of a guy in his 60s.

02:32.859 --> 02:38.696
The diminished tooth sockets
are typical of an elderly man.

02:38.732 --> 02:40.765
But the wear

02:40.801 --> 02:43.568
on the molars
and the incisors indicates

02:43.603 --> 02:45.236
he was in his forties.

02:45.272 --> 02:47.372
Looks like he has
very poor dental care.

02:48.675 --> 02:50.542
SAROYAN:
There are holes

02:50.577 --> 02:52.210
on what's left of the shoes.

02:52.245 --> 02:54.257
It seems like this guy
has fallen through the cracks.

02:54.281 --> 02:56.080
Why did the killer choose him?

02:56.116 --> 02:57.682
Why draw all this
attention to someone

02:57.717 --> 02:59.417
who's completely
down on their luck?

02:59.453 --> 03:01.986
That is not relevant unless
it helps us solve the case.

03:02.022 --> 03:04.823
Let's get these remains
back to the Jeffersonian.

03:04.858 --> 03:07.759
Zygomatic arches indicate
the victim was Caucasoid,

03:07.794 --> 03:10.361
while the length
of the femur suggests

03:10.397 --> 03:13.398
he was approximately
five feet ten inches tall.

03:13.433 --> 03:15.066
And rats did
this to him?

03:15.101 --> 03:17.302
There's no predation
from any other animals.

03:17.337 --> 03:19.137
I've reviewed the X-rays.

03:19.172 --> 03:20.939
There are fragmentation wounds

03:20.974 --> 03:24.309
on the left clavicle,
scapula and femur.

03:24.344 --> 03:27.378
I've seen
fracturing like this before.

03:27.414 --> 03:29.481
There appears to be

03:29.516 --> 03:30.882
shrapnel residue.

03:30.917 --> 03:34.419
IED?
HODGINS: Yeah, it could be.

03:34.454 --> 03:36.521
Which means this guy
might be former military.

03:36.556 --> 03:40.425
There are multiple signs
of trauma to the body.

03:40.460 --> 03:43.728
All are consistent with battle.

03:43.763 --> 03:45.530
This is unusual.

03:45.565 --> 03:48.800
Both prepatellar bursae
are swollen.

03:48.835 --> 03:51.803
Doesn't "both" mean
it's housemaid's knee?

03:51.838 --> 03:53.638
I don't think
this guy was a housemaid.

03:53.673 --> 03:56.741
The condition arises
from extensive kneeling.

03:56.776 --> 03:58.810
It is most common
in manual laborers.

03:58.845 --> 04:00.879
SAROYAN:
Well, I've also heard of it

04:00.914 --> 04:02.714
in the devoutly religious.

04:02.749 --> 04:04.849
Nuns, monks, priests.

04:04.885 --> 04:08.119
Not many priests
have seen combat.

04:08.154 --> 04:09.988
What's wrong?

04:10.023 --> 04:13.758
I-I need to see the ossicles
of the inner ear.

04:14.828 --> 04:16.793
(computer chirps)

04:18.832 --> 04:21.733
Magnify them.

04:23.370 --> 04:25.904
(computer chirps)

04:25.939 --> 04:27.472
There are fractures

04:27.507 --> 04:28.840
on the stapes.

04:28.875 --> 04:31.242
They've remodeled
some time ago.

04:31.278 --> 04:32.911
14 years.

04:32.946 --> 04:34.712
How can you be so precise?

04:34.748 --> 04:37.215
Because Booth has
similar fractures.

04:37.250 --> 04:39.517
I need to see
your reconstruction.

04:39.553 --> 04:41.653
Um, I'm-I'm nowhere near done.

04:41.688 --> 04:43.588
Please.

04:43.623 --> 04:46.124
Okay.

04:48.628 --> 04:51.129
(computer trills)

04:53.900 --> 04:56.034
Can you fill in the hair?

04:56.069 --> 04:57.402
(sighs)

04:57.437 --> 04:59.504
Yeah. What color?
Black.

04:59.539 --> 05:02.006
It will be black.

05:02.042 --> 05:03.508
(computer chirps)

05:03.543 --> 05:04.809
Longer.

05:06.146 --> 05:07.679
(computer chirps)

05:08.748 --> 05:11.649
The eyes are blue.

05:12.886 --> 05:14.419
(computer chirps)

05:14.454 --> 05:19.457
The nose-- can you broaden
the Alar side walls?

05:19.492 --> 05:21.893
(computer chirps)

05:24.497 --> 05:26.664
Wait. Isn't that...?
That's Aldo Clemens.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.666
Who is Aldo Clemens?

05:28.702 --> 05:29.968
(computer chirps)

05:30.003 --> 05:32.904
MONTENEGRO:
He married Booth and Brennan.

05:32.939 --> 05:36.474
He was also the, uh, chaplain
of Booth's army unit.

05:36.509 --> 05:42.880
Booth said that when he was
in trouble, Aldo saved him.

05:42.916 --> 05:45.883
He owed Aldo his life.

05:45.919 --> 05:49.919

Aldo was a good

06:24.188 --> 06:26.822
You have my sympathies.
Thanks.

06:26.857 --> 06:28.690
You're right.
Sympathy sucks.

06:28.725 --> 06:30.058
What do we know?

06:30.094 --> 06:31.793
Nothing that ties anyone
to the scene.

06:31.829 --> 06:34.029
Aubrey's digging for witnesses,
parking tickets...

06:34.064 --> 06:35.416
You think anything's
gonna come of it?

06:35.440 --> 06:36.893
I don't know.

06:40.671 --> 06:43.099
I hear Aldo was
in rough shape.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.606
What was going on with him?

06:44.607 --> 06:45.758
I don't know, Caroline.

06:45.759 --> 06:47.486
I-I hadn't spoken to him
for over a year.

06:47.510 --> 06:48.978
If I know you,

06:48.979 --> 06:50.612
you tried.
You know what?

06:50.647 --> 06:53.248
I'm not gonna let myself off
the hook on this one, all right?

06:53.283 --> 06:56.318
Anytime I needed anything,
<i>anything,</i>

06:56.353 --> 06:58.053
Aldo was always there for me.

06:58.088 --> 07:00.655
I'm sure that goes for the
other men in your unit, too.

07:00.691 --> 07:01.990
What does that mean?

07:02.025 --> 07:03.992
He took on all
their troubles.

07:04.027 --> 07:06.261
It could be
he didn't want you

07:06.296 --> 07:07.874
getting pulled in, too.
Yeah, well, it's too late,

07:07.898 --> 07:10.065
'cause I'm gonna find out
who did this to him.

07:10.100 --> 07:12.300
Of course you are.

07:12.336 --> 07:15.637
This is a little <i>Lepisma</i>
<i>saccharina,</i> aka silverfish.

07:15.672 --> 07:18.206
So their diet consists of
cellulose and polysaccharides,

07:18.242 --> 07:20.909
basically anything
you find in a house, so,

07:20.944 --> 07:23.545
dinner is carpet,
and dessert is curtains.

07:23.580 --> 07:25.023
So, our guy's not
from the park?

07:25.047 --> 07:27.415
No. My guess is
that he hitched a ride

07:27.451 --> 07:29.117
from wherever the victim
was killed.

07:29.153 --> 07:30.630
You know, I'm gonna go have
a little chat with him,

07:30.654 --> 07:32.232
see if he can't help us
find our way back there.

07:32.256 --> 07:33.822
There are antemortem contusions

07:33.857 --> 07:36.458
on the right and left metacarpals.
SAROYAN: Suggesting

07:36.493 --> 07:38.204
Aldo Clemens was getting
into a lot of fights.

07:38.228 --> 07:39.561
I don't get it.

07:39.596 --> 07:41.163
He was a priest.

07:41.198 --> 07:43.265
Well, he left the priesthood
after he came back.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.667
Do you know why?

07:45.702 --> 07:48.203
Booth once told me that, um,

07:48.238 --> 07:50.071
Aldo never stopped
believing in God,

07:50.107 --> 07:52.774
but that his belief
no longer comforted him,

07:52.809 --> 07:55.177
not after what he'd seen, so...

07:55.212 --> 07:57.646
how could he make
it his life's work?

07:57.681 --> 08:03.552
Ugh. Aubrey is worried about
what this will do to Booth.

08:03.587 --> 08:06.388
Yeah, the past is a rabbit hole.

08:06.423 --> 08:08.456
I'm worried about him, too.

08:10.928 --> 08:14.229
Aldo's spiral is, unfortunately,
not an aberration.

08:14.264 --> 08:18.733
Studies show that erratic,
self-destructive behavior

08:18.769 --> 08:21.803
is a common
post-concussive syndrome

08:21.838 --> 08:24.839
that can manifest years
after the initial trauma.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.408
I got concussed
too, Bones, all right?

08:26.443 --> 08:28.310
I was in the same
explosion as Aldo.

08:28.345 --> 08:29.778
I am aware of that.

08:29.813 --> 08:32.147
Because of your brain tumor,
I am also quite familiar

08:32.182 --> 08:34.749
with MRI's
of your cerebellum.

08:34.784 --> 08:35.817
I'm not concerned

08:35.852 --> 08:38.419
for your mental health.

08:38.455 --> 08:40.455
I could've gotten him help.

08:40.490 --> 08:42.157
Perhaps.

08:42.192 --> 08:43.991
But that's in the past.

08:44.027 --> 08:47.696
<i>Moving forward, there is only</i>
<i>one thing you can do for Aldo.</i>

08:47.731 --> 08:49.876
Look, if you're gonna tell me
to forgive myself, please don't.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.811
Forgiveness would be ineffective.
Okay then, what?

08:51.835 --> 08:53.735
I mean, what works?
Revenge.

08:53.770 --> 08:55.837
That's not me.
I mean, there are rules.

08:55.872 --> 08:58.306
You will follow those rules.

08:58.342 --> 09:01.977
The act of bringing a murderer
to justice is,

09:02.012 --> 09:04.913
anthropologically speaking,
a form of revenge.

09:04.948 --> 09:07.449
You have suffered a loss.

09:07.484 --> 09:09.584
Making the killer suffer
for that loss will help.

09:09.620 --> 09:11.152
Yeah, well, I hope so, Bones.

09:11.188 --> 09:14.022
Because right now
I couldn't feel much worse.

09:20.998 --> 09:22.797
AUBREY:
<i>Hey.</i>

09:22.833 --> 09:25.200
<i>You, uh, got something that</i>
<i>could help with the case?</i>

09:25.235 --> 09:27.369
Because we could use it.
(sighs)

09:27.404 --> 09:30.171
This is not about the case.

09:30.207 --> 09:31.706
Where's this from?

09:31.742 --> 09:33.808
Miami International Airport.

09:33.844 --> 09:35.054
He used the name of
a Dutch national

09:35.078 --> 09:36.444
who's long since dead

09:36.480 --> 09:39.381
so it took two weeks
to work its way through

09:39.416 --> 09:41.983
our fugitive facial
recognition system.

09:42.019 --> 09:43.618
He's made some changes
to his face,

09:43.654 --> 09:45.854
but if you're asking
for an I.D.,

09:45.889 --> 09:47.088
that's him.

09:47.124 --> 09:48.657
That's my dad.

09:48.692 --> 09:52.160
Treasury's been tracking
and closing his accounts.

09:52.195 --> 09:54.329
They've squeezed him to
the point where he may be back

09:54.364 --> 09:57.165
to dig up whatever
remaining assets he has left.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.367
He's running
a hell of a risk.

09:59.403 --> 10:01.736
Well, if it's about money,
he'll risk it.

10:01.772 --> 10:04.005
He may reach out
to you for help.

10:04.041 --> 10:07.909
(scoffs)
That would be a mistake.

10:07.944 --> 10:09.544
You sound pretty
confident about that.

10:09.579 --> 10:11.313
The man's your father.

10:11.348 --> 10:12.681
And I already
turned him in once,

10:12.716 --> 10:15.417
so it'll be even easier
the second time.

10:18.221 --> 10:20.855
You know how Dr. B says that
the bones don't just reveal

10:20.891 --> 10:22.557
the victim's death,

10:22.592 --> 10:24.659
they also reveal
the victim's life?

10:24.695 --> 10:27.529
Unfortunately, the only thing
this body's revealing

10:27.564 --> 10:30.098
is sadness, pain, and decline.

10:30.133 --> 10:32.067
Oh, fractures from fights,

10:32.102 --> 10:35.704
density loss from poor
nutrition, drunken falls.

10:35.739 --> 10:38.873
And this liver
tells a story on its own.

10:38.909 --> 10:40.775
Vesicular degeneration
makes it pretty clear

10:40.811 --> 10:42.977
he became a heavy drug user.

10:43.013 --> 10:44.579
Well, he had all his teeth,

10:44.614 --> 10:45.947
so it wasn't meth.

10:45.982 --> 10:48.249
Well, heroin's the most likely
candidate.

10:48.285 --> 10:49.751
It has too short a half-life

10:49.786 --> 10:51.419
to show up on a tox screen.

10:51.455 --> 10:53.421
But if we could find his dealer,

10:53.457 --> 10:55.790
that might be helpful.

10:55.826 --> 10:58.860
Hold it, I've got an idea.

10:58.895 --> 11:02.630
I thought these scratches
on the proximal phalanges

11:02.666 --> 11:04.399
were caused by rat predation.

11:04.434 --> 11:06.701
I never asked,
why eat the toes

11:06.737 --> 11:09.037
when there's so much good
stuff left on the body?

11:09.072 --> 11:11.539
I might not have
asked that one either.

11:11.575 --> 11:13.375
Wait, are these scratches
needle marks?

11:13.410 --> 11:16.277
They're the right depth
and appropriate length.

11:16.313 --> 11:18.491
I'm hoping there's trace amounts
of heroin on the bones.

11:18.515 --> 11:20.115
Well, if so,
it wouldn't metabolize

11:20.150 --> 11:21.427
the way it does
in the bloodstream.

11:21.451 --> 11:25.220
Ask Hodgins to swab
for particulates.

11:27.691 --> 11:30.425
♪ ♪
(indistinct chatter)

11:32.662 --> 11:33.962
Tom Ellis?

11:33.997 --> 11:35.597
Police?

11:35.632 --> 11:37.565
No, FBI. Special Agent
Seeley Booth. This...

11:37.601 --> 11:39.701
And I'm his partner,
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

11:39.736 --> 11:42.537
We're here to ask you
questions about Aldo Clemens.

11:42.572 --> 11:44.139
What'd Aldo do?

11:44.174 --> 11:45.707
He died last night.

11:45.742 --> 11:47.842
Well, if you guys are here,
I assume it was murder.

11:47.878 --> 11:49.611
You don't seem too upset
about it.

11:49.646 --> 11:51.379
I liked Aldo.

11:51.415 --> 11:53.815
Hated having to fire him,
but that's the way it goes,

11:53.850 --> 11:55.016
right?

11:55.051 --> 11:56.284
Why'd you fire him?

11:56.319 --> 11:58.553
He was stealing
from the tip jar.

11:58.588 --> 12:00.555
You fought with him.
His facial bones were broken.

12:00.590 --> 12:03.024
There's extensive fracturing
to the ribs.

12:03.059 --> 12:04.492
You hit him so hard

12:04.528 --> 12:05.860
your hand
was broken.

12:05.896 --> 12:07.128
Who told you about that?

12:07.164 --> 12:08.663
It's poorly set,
which I can see.

12:08.698 --> 12:10.265
I also checked your
hospital records,

12:10.300 --> 12:13.501
because I do thorough research.
She's good.

12:13.537 --> 12:16.438
It was self-defense.
He came at me.

12:16.473 --> 12:17.839
Where were you yesterday?

12:17.874 --> 12:19.841
I was working here
at the bar.

12:19.876 --> 12:21.142
I close up at 5:00 a.m.

12:21.178 --> 12:23.211
You can check it out
with any of my regulars.

12:29.352 --> 12:33.321
Can you think of anyone who
may have wanted to hurt Aldo?

12:33.356 --> 12:34.789
He was spinning out of control.

12:34.825 --> 12:37.158
He would've done anything
for his next fix.

12:37.194 --> 12:39.093
Who was his dealer?
No idea.

12:39.129 --> 12:40.495
Never saw him, didn't want to.

12:40.530 --> 12:41.863
But I heard Aldo call him,

12:41.898 --> 12:44.632
begging him,
promising him anything.

12:44.668 --> 12:46.501
He just didn't have
the money.

12:46.536 --> 12:48.470
If Aldo tried anything with him,

12:48.505 --> 12:51.706
he might not have gone easy
on him like I did.

12:55.735 --> 12:58.908
There are fractures on
the left fifth and sixth ribs,

12:58.909 --> 13:01.647
the nasal bones, and
the zygomatic process

13:01.648 --> 13:03.364
of the left maxilla.

13:03.365 --> 13:05.766
BRENNAN: They're impact
fractures, most likely caused

13:05.801 --> 13:08.635
by Aldo's fight with Tom Ellis,
which was a month ago.

13:08.670 --> 13:12.606
There are additional fractures
on the ribs

13:12.641 --> 13:14.040
which appear
to be more recent.

13:14.076 --> 13:17.244
Take a look, Ms. Warren.
Could those have been caused

13:17.279 --> 13:19.813
by the same assailant?
The amount of remodeling

13:19.848 --> 13:23.817
indicates the damage
is no more than two weeks old.

13:23.852 --> 13:26.286
That is not consistent
with what Tom Ellis

13:26.321 --> 13:28.655
told Booth and me.
But the directionality

13:28.690 --> 13:31.358
of the wounds indicates
a left-handed assailant.

13:31.393 --> 13:32.959
Isn't Tom Ellis
right-handed?

13:32.995 --> 13:35.896
He is.
Someone else is responsible

13:35.931 --> 13:36.679
for these wounds.

13:36.703 --> 13:38.633
If you're noticing a zip
in my roll,

13:38.634 --> 13:41.701
it's because I am officially
extremely excited.

13:41.737 --> 13:43.114
I swabbed the needle marks
on the proximal phalanges.

13:43.138 --> 13:45.872
I came up
with heroin particulates.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.419
Did you find enough
particulates to run

13:47.443 --> 13:50.210
a chromatographic impurity
profile analysis?

13:50.245 --> 13:51.578
Yeah. Nine whole micrograms.

13:51.613 --> 13:53.947
Angela's running
a signature profile now.

13:53.982 --> 13:56.116
So, Aldo was shooting
a cocktail of codeine,

13:56.151 --> 13:59.853
phenobarbital, ascorbic acid,
finely ground glass...

13:59.888 --> 14:02.122
Glass?
How does that happen?

14:02.157 --> 14:05.525
It's actually a fairly common
adulterant. What's interesting

14:05.561 --> 14:07.994
is the high proportion of
diamorphine hydrochloride.

14:08.030 --> 14:08.926
That's the actual heroin.

14:08.950 --> 14:11.050
BRENNAN: It suggests
Aldo's drugs came

14:11.066 --> 14:13.667
from a high-end dealer.
MONTENEGRO: Oh, then

14:13.702 --> 14:15.569
we should be able
to identify him.

14:15.604 --> 14:17.671
The DEA maintains this database

14:17.706 --> 14:19.573
of known and suspected dealers
in the area.

14:19.608 --> 14:21.208
If we can just enter
the proportions

14:21.243 --> 14:22.876
that Hodgins gave us,
we should be able

14:22.911 --> 14:23.723
to narrow this down.

14:23.724 --> 14:24.776
HODGINS:
All right, well,

14:24.780 --> 14:26.224
that's a lot better
than where we started.

14:26.248 --> 14:27.525
BRENNAN: We can narrow
that further.

14:27.549 --> 14:28.815
How many are left-handed?

14:28.851 --> 14:30.016
Uh, I don't think

14:30.052 --> 14:31.418
that's included
on the rap sheets.

14:31.453 --> 14:34.588
Hmm. Bring up their photos.

14:38.360 --> 14:42.896
The left clavicle on this one
is higher than the right.

14:42.931 --> 14:44.665
That's an indication
of handedness.

14:44.689 --> 14:45.833
SAROYAN: Also,

14:45.834 --> 14:47.834
his left deltoid
is slightly more developed.

14:47.870 --> 14:49.402
And he parts his hair
to the right.

14:49.438 --> 14:51.471
I mean, most lefties do that.

14:52.441 --> 14:54.574
MONTENEGRO:
Jake Tompkins.

14:54.610 --> 14:57.844
I'll call Booth
and let him know.

14:59.000 --> 15:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:06.889 --> 15:10.490
AUBREY: So, this hood isn't exactly
screaming "drug dealer."

15:10.526 --> 15:12.192
You sure we got
the right address?

15:12.227 --> 15:14.794
Well, Tompkins is not your,
you know, usual drug dealer.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.796
He runs
a very efficient business.

15:16.832 --> 15:19.733
Well, I mean, he has to
have slipped up somewhere.

15:19.768 --> 15:21.401
Otherwise he wouldn't
be in the database.

15:21.436 --> 15:23.648
Well, he was charged, but he
was never convicted, you know?

15:23.672 --> 15:26.973
Like I said,
he's very careful.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.575
(doorbell ringing)

15:29.444 --> 15:32.345
Yo.

15:32.381 --> 15:33.980
(doorbell rings)
(whistles)

15:34.016 --> 15:35.248
Jake Tompkins?

15:35.284 --> 15:37.284
FBI. Special Agent
Seeley Booth.

15:37.319 --> 15:38.919
Special Agent James Aubrey.

15:38.954 --> 15:40.086
How can I help you?

15:40.122 --> 15:41.432
Ask you a few questions.
When was the last time

15:41.456 --> 15:42.822
you saw Aldo Clemens?
Sorry,

15:42.858 --> 15:43.610
don't know him.

15:43.612 --> 15:45.551
Look at the photo,
Jake, okay?

15:46.028 --> 15:46.993
Clemens was found dead
this morning.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.361
We know
that you were his dealer.

15:48.397 --> 15:50.263
Okay. I think we're done here.

15:50.299 --> 15:51.631
I don't know anything
about drugs.

15:51.667 --> 15:53.500
And just so we're super clear
on that,

15:53.535 --> 15:55.063
I'm gonna go call my lawyer.
Thanks.

15:55.064 --> 15:55.400
Okay, you do that.

15:55.404 --> 15:57.482
You call your lawyer, and
he'll get you out in no time.

15:57.506 --> 15:58.738
But that's when I get started.

15:58.774 --> 16:00.073
What is that supposed to mean?

16:00.108 --> 16:01.419
I'll be all over you.
Whatever you do,

16:01.443 --> 16:03.310
buy, sell, I'll be watching you.

16:03.345 --> 16:05.145
That's actually called
harassment.

16:05.180 --> 16:06.320
It is. It's called harassment.

16:06.344 --> 16:07.081
You really want
to do that

16:07.082 --> 16:08.860
to your business, Jake?
Look, we're just after

16:08.884 --> 16:10.850
whoever actually killed
Aldo Clemens.

16:10.886 --> 16:13.286
My hunch is killing
isn't exactly your thing.

16:13.322 --> 16:16.823
Answer some questions,
I'll be out of your life.

16:16.858 --> 16:19.392
I might have known this guy.

16:19.428 --> 16:21.528
If I did,

16:21.563 --> 16:23.964
I would have dropped him
as a client months ago.

16:23.999 --> 16:25.632
He run out of money?
No.

16:25.667 --> 16:28.401
They always find the money.
Aldo...

16:28.437 --> 16:30.337
had become a risk.

16:30.372 --> 16:32.405
Some guy was following
him, so I cut him off.

16:32.441 --> 16:34.307
Who was following Aldo?
You got a name?

16:34.343 --> 16:36.109
I can't even tell you
what he looked like.

16:36.144 --> 16:38.122
He was some guy in a crappy
car. I thought he was a cop.

16:38.146 --> 16:39.479
He drove by
a few times.

16:39.514 --> 16:41.114
He never got out of the car.

16:41.149 --> 16:43.450
Sorry.
I wish I could be more help.

16:43.485 --> 16:46.019
Yeah, well, actually,
you know what, you can.

16:46.054 --> 16:46.762
What are you doing?

16:46.786 --> 16:48.022
This is one of those
video doorbells

16:48.023 --> 16:50.090
that record you, right?
Yes, it is.

16:50.125 --> 16:51.469
Do you know
how much that thing cost me?

16:51.493 --> 16:53.493
A lot. They're very expensive.

16:53.528 --> 16:56.229
But it's good for you, because
then it'll confirm your story.

16:56.264 --> 16:59.232
Thank you very much for this.

17:03.405 --> 17:05.605
Hey. Honey, let's go home.

17:05.641 --> 17:07.674
It's late.
Mm-hmm.

17:07.709 --> 17:11.344
I'm almost finished.
I'm gonna be done in a second.

17:11.380 --> 17:13.646
Oh, no, you won't.

17:13.682 --> 17:17.117
Do not tell me that you are
operating on a silverfish.

17:17.152 --> 17:19.019
Well, it's more like
a scenic journey

17:19.054 --> 17:20.387
through his digestive tract.

17:20.422 --> 17:22.222
Okay. I'll be in my office.

17:22.257 --> 17:25.224
Hold on, Angie.
Look what I found.

17:27.496 --> 17:29.129
Oh.

17:29.164 --> 17:32.032
Wow, that's actually
kind of beautiful.

17:32.067 --> 17:34.267
Right? So, this is
just the sort of saccharide

17:34.302 --> 17:35.869
most silverfish love
to munch on.

17:35.904 --> 17:38.405
In this case, it's
a highly magnified particulate

17:38.440 --> 17:40.640
of professional grade
acoustic foam.

17:40.676 --> 17:42.976
So if that bug hitched a ride

17:43.011 --> 17:44.844
on Aldo's body...
We need to call Booth.

17:44.880 --> 17:47.380
Uh, Brennan said Booth's busy.

17:47.416 --> 17:49.049
What, too busy
to hear about this?

17:49.084 --> 17:52.619
Trust me, it's important.

17:52.654 --> 17:55.255
(crickets chirping)

17:59.027 --> 18:01.327
Sergeant. It's been a while.

18:01.363 --> 18:02.566
Yeah, too long.

18:02.590 --> 18:04.065
I wish it was
for a different occasion.

18:04.066 --> 18:07.500
Yeah, me, too.
Who killed him, Seeley?

18:07.536 --> 18:08.964
I don't know, Dave,
but I'm gonna find out.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.071
Need my help?

18:10.072 --> 18:13.473
No, I'm good. But either of
you two, uh, ever hear from Aldo

18:13.508 --> 18:15.308
before he, uh, went missing?

18:15.343 --> 18:17.477
Not me.
He wasn't easy to find.

18:17.512 --> 18:19.624
All right, well, if you hear
anything, just let me know.

18:19.648 --> 18:21.215
It's my job now
to take care of things, okay?

18:21.239 --> 18:23.728
Sure, Booth, we'll sit and wait
for that to happen.

18:23.729 --> 18:24.762
You know what, Ted, I'm not here

18:24.786 --> 18:27.454
to get into this with you
right now. This is about Aldo.

18:27.489 --> 18:28.933
Guess that's what it takes--
one of us dying

18:28.957 --> 18:30.757
before he comes around here.
Oh, come on, Ted,

18:30.792 --> 18:33.004
you know he had nothing to do
with Father Clemens' murder.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.428
Yeah. What did Booth do
to help him stay alive?

18:35.464 --> 18:35.867
Not enough.

18:35.891 --> 18:37.064
We all could have been
more in touch with him.

18:37.065 --> 18:38.543
DAVE: He's the reason
that we're all home.

18:38.567 --> 18:40.500
At least for me, I'm grateful.

18:40.535 --> 18:41.735
For what?

18:41.770 --> 18:43.403
You moved on, started a family.

18:43.438 --> 18:44.939
It wasn't that easy
for the rest of us.

18:44.940 --> 18:47.808
Look, Ted, I can't make up for not being
around, okay? But I'm here now.

18:47.843 --> 18:49.476
It's too late for that.

18:49.511 --> 18:52.645
I'm done with you, like
you were done with all of us.

19:02.485 --> 19:04.985
(crickets chirping)

19:07.723 --> 19:10.224
It's very late.

19:10.259 --> 19:13.627
I didn't hear
you come in.

19:15.498 --> 19:19.033
Well, I wanted
to let you sleep.

19:25.675 --> 19:29.043
It didn't go well
with the men?

19:31.414 --> 19:34.615
These guys saw hell.

19:34.650 --> 19:37.951
You know, most of them
are still paying the price.

19:37.987 --> 19:42.856
You feel the effects of war,
too, Booth.

19:42.892 --> 19:44.292
Yeah.

19:44.293 --> 19:47.027
Yeah, but I got lucky.

19:47.163 --> 19:49.830
I got a great family
and great life.

19:49.865 --> 19:52.299
Got all this.

19:52.335 --> 19:54.935
You're an addict,
just like Aldo.

19:54.971 --> 19:56.604
Yeah.

19:57.506 --> 20:00.608
Unlike him, you got help.

20:00.643 --> 20:02.543
Yeah. But you're in my corner.

20:02.578 --> 20:05.946
That's the difference.
Aldo had no one.

20:08.551 --> 20:10.784
(beeping)

20:10.820 --> 20:14.321
Hey. I just, uh,
dropped off Jessica.

20:14.357 --> 20:16.101
And, let me guess,
you thought you might check in

20:16.125 --> 20:19.059
to see what I'm getting
from Tompkins' video doorbell.

20:19.095 --> 20:20.294
Looks like it's
rough going.

20:20.329 --> 20:22.129
I thought those things
actually worked.

20:22.164 --> 20:25.399
They do. They record everyone
that comes to the door.

20:25.434 --> 20:27.768
But it's got such
a small hard drive,

20:27.803 --> 20:31.338
so, once it's full, it
just records over itself.

20:31.374 --> 20:32.539
So it's useless.

20:32.575 --> 20:34.108
Well, no, not exactly.

20:34.143 --> 20:36.210
Stuff doesn't
actually disappear.

20:36.245 --> 20:38.912
It just gets jumbled.
I was able to plug in this

20:38.948 --> 20:41.382
facial recognition software
to isolate the times

20:41.417 --> 20:43.117
that Aldo came to the house.

20:43.152 --> 20:45.986
Is that him? I can't see it.

20:46.022 --> 20:49.123
Oh, uh, that's because
you're not looking at Aldo.

20:49.158 --> 20:51.191
You're looking at
what's behind him.

20:51.227 --> 20:54.662
I'm trying to isolate the car
that was following him.

20:56.299 --> 20:58.332
AUBREY: Well,
that's a few too many times

20:58.367 --> 20:59.900
to be a coincidence.

20:59.935 --> 21:01.635
Yeah, agreed.

21:01.671 --> 21:04.305
Now we just have to figure out
who was driving it.

21:07.143 --> 21:08.876
BRENNAN:
<i>Ms. Warren.</i>

21:08.911 --> 21:10.110
You wanted to see me?

21:10.146 --> 21:12.112
I was reexamining
the spinal column,

21:12.148 --> 21:15.349
and I found these fractures
on the C1 and C2.

21:15.384 --> 21:19.019
They suggest that the vertebrae
were severely displaced.

21:19.055 --> 21:22.623
Which indicates a
hyperflexion fracture.

21:22.658 --> 21:24.758
The neck was snapped

21:24.794 --> 21:26.327
at the C2 vertebra.

21:26.362 --> 21:29.163
That would cause
complete paralysis

21:29.198 --> 21:31.365
of all muscles
below the brain stem.

21:31.400 --> 21:33.801
Yes. The lungs
cease functioning,

21:33.836 --> 21:37.538
resulting in a complete loss
of oxygen to the brain.

21:37.573 --> 21:39.940
Cause of death
wasn't exsanguination.

21:39.975 --> 21:41.642
It was this fracture.

21:41.677 --> 21:43.777
Uh, Dr. Brennan.

21:43.813 --> 21:45.646
Yes?

21:45.681 --> 21:48.682
Didn't your father
come back into your life

21:48.718 --> 21:51.452
after spending years
as a fugitive?

21:52.722 --> 21:55.522
You're concerned
about what Aubrey will do

21:55.558 --> 21:58.592
if he finally comes face-to-face
with his dad?

21:59.528 --> 22:00.994
How can he live with himself

22:01.030 --> 22:03.197
if he turns in his own father?

22:04.433 --> 22:06.967
My father had abandoned
me and my brother,

22:07.002 --> 22:10.070
he was a fugitive from justice.

22:10.106 --> 22:13.140
I... I certainly
never anticipated

22:13.175 --> 22:14.908
that we would manage to have

22:14.944 --> 22:16.577
a positive relationship.

22:16.612 --> 22:18.679
How did you make that happen?

22:18.714 --> 22:22.383
By opening myself
to the fact that...

22:22.418 --> 22:25.919
his actions,
while partially his fault,

22:25.955 --> 22:29.556
were necessitated by events.

22:30.693 --> 22:32.760
He's a much better man

22:32.795 --> 22:35.195
than the one
I had built him up to be.

22:35.231 --> 22:38.665
So there's a chance
that could happen for Aubrey?

22:38.701 --> 22:41.769
Statistically, there's always
a chance, Ms. Warren.

22:55.885 --> 22:57.751
There's been
another sighting.

22:57.787 --> 22:59.253
Where?

22:59.288 --> 23:00.854
Uh, it's a
financial record.

23:00.890 --> 23:02.489
Tell me, is there
any difference

23:02.525 --> 23:04.925
between a latte
and a latte macchiato?

23:04.960 --> 23:06.271
Wait, wait, wait,
I don't understand

23:06.295 --> 23:08.262
how a financial record
is a sighting.

23:08.297 --> 23:09.897
We'll get to that.

23:09.932 --> 23:11.598
With a latte,
you add your espresso shot

23:11.634 --> 23:13.345
to the steamed milk,
the, uh, the macchiato,

23:13.369 --> 23:14.735
it's the reverse.

23:14.770 --> 23:16.703
And you taste the difference?
Absolutely.

23:16.739 --> 23:18.539
I don't buy it.

23:18.574 --> 23:19.840
So...

23:19.875 --> 23:22.376
where was he seen?

23:22.411 --> 23:24.111
Well, we have good evidence,

23:24.146 --> 23:27.347
but not eyewitnesses,
from a wire office in Atlanta.

23:27.383 --> 23:29.883
There was a transfer
for $9,000

23:29.919 --> 23:32.853
from an overseas account
that's tied to an alias

23:32.888 --> 23:35.522
previously used
by Philip Aubrey.

23:35.558 --> 23:37.958
All right.

23:37.993 --> 23:40.327
Small office, high volume.

23:40.362 --> 23:42.529
Clientele is primarily
alien laborers.

23:42.565 --> 23:44.998
And the amount transferred
is just a hair

23:45.034 --> 23:48.235
under the FDIC
notification threshold.

23:48.270 --> 23:50.237
That's definitely him.

23:50.272 --> 23:51.672
Now he's got cash.

23:51.707 --> 23:53.140
He may go under.
(phone rings)

23:53.175 --> 23:54.675
He's here
for a reason.

23:54.710 --> 23:56.910
He's making
his way north.

23:56.946 --> 23:58.579
He'll surface.

23:58.614 --> 24:00.013
Aubrey.

24:00.049 --> 24:02.916
Hey, so I was able to
filter out most of

24:02.952 --> 24:05.285
the visual noise
from the doorbell video.

24:05.321 --> 24:07.721
Did you find the vehicle
that was following Aldo?

24:07.756 --> 24:09.656
Yeah, I'll send you a link.

24:10.459 --> 24:13.927
It's a '97 Intrepid.

24:13.963 --> 24:15.362
Did you get a plate number?

24:15.397 --> 24:17.965
I couldn't from this angle,
so I went through

24:18.000 --> 24:20.300
all the traffic cams
in the area.

24:20.336 --> 24:23.103
The car belongs to Ted McKinney.

24:23.138 --> 24:24.805
He's former military.

24:24.840 --> 24:26.707
He actually served
in Booth's unit.

24:26.742 --> 24:29.510
Booth's not gonna like this.

24:29.545 --> 24:31.011
Me either, <i>Cher.</i>

24:31.046 --> 24:34.448
That is not something
I wanted to see.

24:34.483 --> 24:36.216
If you think I killed Aldo,
you're nuts.

24:36.252 --> 24:37.718
I don't know what to think.

24:37.753 --> 24:39.753
Why were you following him?

24:39.788 --> 24:42.022
That's my business.

24:42.057 --> 24:44.791
Well, you're in here, so
it becomes my business now.

24:44.827 --> 24:46.438
You really think Booth's
the guy for this?

24:46.462 --> 24:47.494
They have a history.

24:47.530 --> 24:50.397
I can't think of anyone better.

24:50.432 --> 24:51.765
BOOTH:
Recognize that car?

24:51.800 --> 24:53.233
It might be mine.

24:53.269 --> 24:54.468
It might be yours.

24:54.503 --> 24:56.169
Oh, I think it's yours,

24:56.205 --> 24:58.138
'cause that is you
inside of the car.

24:58.173 --> 24:59.540
Following Aldo.

24:59.575 --> 25:00.685
That's not true.
"That's not true?"

25:00.709 --> 25:02.009
Come on.
Ted, look at this.

25:02.044 --> 25:03.677
I can pull all
these video stills up.

25:03.712 --> 25:05.646
Come on, we have
enough here to build a case.

25:05.681 --> 25:07.247
Do you want to tell
me what's going on?

25:07.283 --> 25:08.482
What happened that night?

25:08.517 --> 25:10.217
Okay, I needed him.

25:11.554 --> 25:14.087
I needed someone and he wouldn't
even talk to me.

25:14.123 --> 25:15.789
I understand, all right?

25:15.824 --> 25:18.926
You felt abandoned.
No one was there for you.

25:18.961 --> 25:22.629
No one was there to
listen, not even Aldo.

25:23.799 --> 25:25.232
Like I didn't even exist.

25:25.267 --> 25:26.800
Look, just tell me...

25:26.835 --> 25:29.403
what happened that night, okay?

25:29.438 --> 25:32.839
I can help you,
no matter what you did.

25:35.544 --> 25:36.777
(sniffs)

25:36.812 --> 25:38.779
I didn't kill Aldo.

25:41.383 --> 25:42.916
I did something worse.

25:42.952 --> 25:44.818
What's worse than killing?

25:46.555 --> 25:49.189
I went looking for him
in Bellevue.

25:49.224 --> 25:52.492
He started to go there
to buy his drugs.

25:52.528 --> 25:56.330
I didn't know
what I was gonna do.

25:56.365 --> 25:58.632
Then, as I'm watching
him, someone pulls up.

25:58.667 --> 26:01.635
The driver gets out
and jumps Aldo.

26:01.670 --> 26:02.869
Who was it?

26:02.905 --> 26:05.305
I don't know.

26:05.341 --> 26:07.074
Come on, Ted, look at me.

26:07.109 --> 26:09.176
You have to remember
who this was.

26:09.211 --> 26:10.644
It could save you.

26:10.679 --> 26:13.480
Whatever happens, I deserve.

26:13.515 --> 26:14.848
Because I froze.

26:14.883 --> 26:16.049
I didn't help him.

26:16.085 --> 26:18.218
Aldo got taken
and I just let it happen,

26:18.253 --> 26:20.821
like-like I wasn't even there.

26:28.479 --> 26:30.079
CAM:
McKinney served with Aldo

26:30.114 --> 26:33.207
and those men trust each other
with their lives.

26:33.214 --> 26:34.747
How could he just watch
Aldo get taken

26:34.783 --> 26:37.483
and not try to help?
I don't know,

26:37.519 --> 26:40.753
but Booth believes
he's telling the truth.

26:40.789 --> 26:42.400
Did McKinney see anything
that we can use?

26:42.424 --> 26:43.823
Nothing specific.

26:43.858 --> 26:46.859
No plate numbers,
no physical characteristics.

26:46.895 --> 26:48.494
But he did say

26:48.530 --> 26:52.732
that it was clean,
precise, perfectly executed.

26:52.767 --> 26:54.464
Perhaps someone else
with military training.

26:54.488 --> 26:55.936
Well, which means

26:55.937 --> 26:59.238
it's possible one of the other
men in his unit is responsible.

26:59.274 --> 27:00.907
You think?
Well...

27:00.942 --> 27:04.944
they carry anger,
they are taught to kill.

27:04.980 --> 27:07.513
There are many recountings,

27:07.549 --> 27:10.016
starting with ancient Greeks,
of returning warriors

27:10.051 --> 27:11.295
murdering those
they are closest to.

27:11.319 --> 27:12.619
WARREN:
Dr. Brennan?

27:12.654 --> 27:14.020
What is it, Ms. Warren?

27:14.055 --> 27:16.155
There's something
you really need to see.

27:18.460 --> 27:21.828
I re-examined the impact
fractures on the left eighth

27:21.863 --> 27:22.565
and ninth ribs.

27:22.589 --> 27:25.213
How did your perception
of the fractures change?

27:25.214 --> 27:26.833
It didn't.
They're exactly the same.

27:26.868 --> 27:28.001
But,

27:28.036 --> 27:30.136
look at these rat bites

27:30.171 --> 27:32.972
on the anterior plane
of the affected sternal ribs.

27:33.008 --> 27:34.474
They are deeper
and closer together

27:34.509 --> 27:35.742
than the other rat bites

27:35.777 --> 27:37.043
which you've catalogued.

27:37.078 --> 27:39.112
That's what I thought.

27:39.147 --> 27:42.015
BRENNAN: They appear to be both
peri and antemortem.

27:42.050 --> 27:43.361
Did you run an
immunohistochemical test?

27:43.385 --> 27:44.584
I did.

27:44.619 --> 27:46.819
It came back positive
for fibrin clots

27:46.855 --> 27:48.588
and new bone deposition.

27:48.623 --> 27:51.324
There is only one

27:51.359 --> 27:53.026
very likely interpretation.

27:53.061 --> 27:55.194
What do you think that is?

27:55.230 --> 27:59.599
That the victim was alive

27:59.634 --> 28:02.101
while the rats
were eating his torso.

28:02.137 --> 28:05.738
That is, indeed,
the most likely possibility.

28:05.774 --> 28:09.842
I've seen a lot of
things, but this?

28:09.878 --> 28:11.944
For the rats to get
inside the ribs like that,

28:11.980 --> 28:14.981
it's... truly horrifying.

28:15.016 --> 28:19.719
There's no better word for it.

28:19.754 --> 28:24.924
Note... the contusions
on the anterior

28:24.959 --> 28:26.826
sternal seventh and tenth ribs.

28:26.861 --> 28:29.395
I catalogued those
as defensive wounds.

28:29.431 --> 28:31.230
That is understandable.

28:31.266 --> 28:34.033
The pattern is also consistent
with a cage

28:34.069 --> 28:36.836
being pressed up against
that section of the torso.

28:45.180 --> 28:47.280
It originated in
the Middle Ages.

28:47.315 --> 28:49.949
The cage would be
filled with rats

28:49.984 --> 28:52.719
One end of it is heated,

28:52.754 --> 28:55.254
so the animals are forced

28:55.290 --> 28:58.224
to burrow into the body
of the still-living victim.

28:58.259 --> 29:01.561
There must be hundreds of bites.

29:01.596 --> 29:03.229
Which indicates

29:03.264 --> 29:08.267
that Aldo Clemens was tortured
for an extended period of time.

29:11.539 --> 29:13.139
BOOTH:
<i>McKinney said that Aldo</i>

29:13.174 --> 29:14.941
went to buy heroin in Bellevue.

29:14.976 --> 29:16.309
And if he's telling the truth...

29:16.344 --> 29:17.710
He's telling the truth.

29:17.746 --> 29:19.178
...then he wouldn't have

29:19.214 --> 29:21.414
any trouble finding product.
It's low quality,

29:21.449 --> 29:24.650
but there's plenty of it and
the dealers aren't too picky.

29:24.686 --> 29:26.486
Has no one here read the report?

29:26.521 --> 29:28.988
Yeah, we read it.
Your close friend

29:29.023 --> 29:30.556
was tortured with rats.

29:30.592 --> 29:32.725
That is something
we need to discuss.

29:32.761 --> 29:34.694
Look, what do you say?
I was hoping

29:34.729 --> 29:36.763
you would have the words.
For something like this,

29:36.798 --> 29:38.397
there's not much
you really can say.

29:38.433 --> 29:41.200
We just... we move on.

29:41.236 --> 29:43.102
And we keep looking
till we find this guy,

29:43.138 --> 29:44.737
and we don't stop.

29:44.773 --> 29:47.006
That was just right, Seeley,
I knew you would have it.

29:47.041 --> 29:49.075
I've been reading about
this kind of torture.

29:49.110 --> 29:50.977
They say it still exists
in the Balkans

29:51.012 --> 29:52.378
and parts of the Middle East.

29:52.413 --> 29:54.046
Yeah, I heard of it.

29:54.082 --> 29:56.082
Your unit served in both.
McKinney was there.

29:56.117 --> 29:57.416
No chance McKinney did it.

29:57.452 --> 29:58.763
Look, the guy
doesn't have a alibi.

29:58.787 --> 30:00.419
He's impulsive and he's angry.

30:00.455 --> 30:02.455
He's too angry to have done it.

30:02.490 --> 30:04.257
CAROLINE:
I agree with Booth.

30:04.292 --> 30:06.459
This was controlled.
It took planning.

30:06.494 --> 30:07.794
McKinney's not capable of that.

30:07.829 --> 30:09.428
Take a look at this, huh?

30:09.464 --> 30:10.930
Look at those tire marks.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.600
AUBREY: They're fresh.
Yeah.

30:14.636 --> 30:17.103
McKinney was parked there,
a half block away.

30:17.138 --> 30:19.705
Then it makes sense
that these tire marks

30:19.741 --> 30:21.808
are from the car that took Aldo.

30:21.843 --> 30:23.342
The tracks run north.

30:23.378 --> 30:25.912
There's a highway
on-ramp three blocks away.

30:25.947 --> 30:27.224
No way he took it.
How do you know that?

30:27.248 --> 30:28.681
Because he's planned.

30:28.716 --> 30:30.261
He thinks of everything.
He's calculated, okay?

30:30.285 --> 30:32.018
There's no way
he's gonna take the highway.

30:32.053 --> 30:33.831
I mean, there's surveillance
cameras all over the place.

30:33.855 --> 30:35.388
CAROLINE:
That explains why we have

30:35.423 --> 30:37.156
next to nothing to work with.
Ah, not true,

30:37.192 --> 30:38.791
we know how he thinks.

30:38.827 --> 30:40.560
What does that get us?
We know that he takes

30:40.595 --> 30:41.961
the road less travelled, Aubrey.

30:41.996 --> 30:43.729
We find that road, we find him.

30:43.765 --> 30:45.832
And we don't stop, got it?

30:45.867 --> 30:47.867
So let's keep looking.

30:47.902 --> 30:49.468
Let's find him.

30:49.504 --> 30:51.504
MONTENEGRO:
So, I used Booth's theory that

30:51.539 --> 30:55.942
whoever took Aldo based their
route on avoiding surveillance.

30:55.977 --> 30:58.077
Every turn they took
was weighted towards

30:58.112 --> 31:00.479
avoiding cameras and crowds.

31:00.515 --> 31:02.348
CAM:
That is elegant.

31:02.383 --> 31:03.850
But what happens

31:03.885 --> 31:05.618
when there's more than
one equal choice?

31:05.653 --> 31:07.320
Yeah, well...

31:07.355 --> 31:11.023
it gets less and less useful.
This is now out of control.

31:11.059 --> 31:13.159
Well, at least it gives us
a general direction.

31:13.194 --> 31:15.661
Hey, I swabbed the perimortem
striations on the ribs.

31:15.697 --> 31:17.196
The rat bites?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

31:17.232 --> 31:19.966
So, rat teeth
never stop growing.

31:20.001 --> 31:22.635
Which means they're always
having to gnaw on something

31:22.670 --> 31:24.036
just to keep them
the right length.

31:24.072 --> 31:25.371
Good to know.

31:25.406 --> 31:27.406
What were they gnawing on?
I don't know.

31:27.442 --> 31:29.175
I found, uh,
particulates of lead paint,

31:29.210 --> 31:32.011
so maybe they were gnawing on
some cabinets, looking for food.

31:32.046 --> 31:34.814
When was lead paint banned?

31:34.849 --> 31:36.249
(beeping)

31:36.284 --> 31:37.917
1978.

31:37.952 --> 31:39.352
So-so, we've got
professional-grade

31:39.387 --> 31:41.487
acoustic foam and lead paint.

31:41.522 --> 31:44.523
We need to be looking for a
sound studio built before 1978.

31:44.559 --> 31:46.826
Somewhere northwest of Bellevue.

31:46.861 --> 31:49.061
Right, but it would have to be
near Rock Creek Park,

31:49.097 --> 31:52.665
because they had to get
that body back there by morning.

31:52.700 --> 31:54.800
(Cam sighs)

31:54.836 --> 31:57.136
That's still a few square miles.

31:57.171 --> 31:58.104
Well, if it's a studio,

31:58.139 --> 32:01.707
it's likely to be abandoned.

32:04.245 --> 32:05.522
That looks like
an industrial park.

32:05.546 --> 32:07.346
Well, it was,

32:07.382 --> 32:09.582
but now it's slated
for demolition.

32:09.617 --> 32:12.151
I'll call Booth.

32:20.762 --> 32:22.094
(glass breaks)

32:48.723 --> 32:50.990
BOOTH: Looks like this is where
he set up shop.

32:51.025 --> 32:54.060
Look at all this stuff.

32:57.031 --> 32:58.464
Booth?

32:58.499 --> 32:59.932
Yeah?

33:00.835 --> 33:03.035
Look at this.

33:03.071 --> 33:04.870
There's parish records.

33:04.906 --> 33:06.505
News clippings about Aldo.

33:06.541 --> 33:08.040
Discharge documents...

33:08.076 --> 33:11.177
This X-ray is not Aldo's.

33:11.212 --> 33:12.778
It's of somebody else.

33:12.814 --> 33:13.846
How do you know?

33:13.881 --> 33:15.314
There's a stellate-shaped wound

33:15.350 --> 33:19.485
directly above
the right squamosal suture.

33:19.520 --> 33:21.020
Gunshot?
Yes.

33:21.055 --> 33:22.989
The extent of the damage

33:23.024 --> 33:25.624
indicates a high powered rifle.

33:25.660 --> 33:29.095
Perfectly placed. Not too many
people can make that shot.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.300
BRENNAN:
The writing is Cyrillic.

33:35.236 --> 33:36.502
Serbian.

33:36.537 --> 33:38.504
That is correct.

33:40.041 --> 33:42.008
Where are you going?

33:42.043 --> 33:44.377
Over here.

33:44.412 --> 33:46.979
Going behind door number two.

33:47.015 --> 33:48.214
Look at this.

33:48.249 --> 33:51.017
This is not good.
(clears throat)

33:51.052 --> 33:52.451
BRENNAN:
Oh...

34:00.061 --> 34:01.994
This is blood.

34:02.030 --> 34:02.962
Aldo's?

34:02.997 --> 34:04.196
We can't be completely sure,

34:04.232 --> 34:05.664
there are tests...

34:07.368 --> 34:08.967
Look at that, Bones. Look.

34:09.003 --> 34:10.402
That's the cage.

34:10.438 --> 34:12.004
(Brennan groans)

34:12.040 --> 34:15.908
Cam will want to do
blood spatter analysis

34:15.943 --> 34:18.244
as soon as possible.

34:18.279 --> 34:21.647
(camera snapping)

34:22.884 --> 34:24.150
Bones.

34:24.185 --> 34:25.217
I need to finish...

34:25.253 --> 34:26.918
No, look. Look!

34:28.322 --> 34:29.455
Booth, that's a bomb!

34:29.489 --> 34:31.489
BOOTH:
We got to go, now.

34:39.634 --> 34:41.367
(grunting)

34:46.474 --> 34:48.007
(gasping)

34:50.812 --> 34:54.346
(Brennan groaning)

35:03.046 --> 35:05.331
Crews are still
battling the blaze

35:05.332 --> 35:08.129
at an abandoned office complex
in Anacostia.

35:08.130 --> 35:10.130
The cause of the fire
is undetermined,

35:10.165 --> 35:13.500
but fire marshals suspect the
strong possibility of arson.

35:13.535 --> 35:15.502
Booth says it
was an IED.

35:15.537 --> 35:18.771
Yeah, but do IEDs usually
take this long to burn off?

35:18.807 --> 35:21.241
HODGINS:
No, Booth saw Jerry Cans of gas.

35:21.276 --> 35:23.810
My hunch is it was powered
by a petroleum gel.

35:23.845 --> 35:26.346
It sticks to everything and
burns at over 2,000 degrees.

35:26.381 --> 35:28.548
Which means there
won't be much left.

35:28.583 --> 35:31.351
Close to zilch.
Whoa, Dr. B.

35:31.386 --> 35:33.486
Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?

35:33.522 --> 35:34.554
My work.

35:34.589 --> 35:35.633
SAROYAN:
W-We can handle this.

35:35.657 --> 35:36.990
You should be home.

35:37.025 --> 35:38.324
Yeah, at the very least,

35:38.360 --> 35:40.460
you shouldn't be
watching this.

35:40.495 --> 35:42.562
It must have
been terrible, huh?

35:42.597 --> 35:44.931
It was unpleasant.

35:44.966 --> 35:48.401
And losing the opportunity to

35:48.436 --> 35:52.238
examine vital evidence
makes it more so.

35:52.274 --> 35:55.074
Right. Well, I uploaded
the photos that you sent.

35:57.245 --> 35:58.444
My theory

35:58.480 --> 36:01.548
is that Aldo Clemens
died on that table.

36:01.583 --> 36:03.449
Why torture him so horribly,

36:03.485 --> 36:05.919
but end it with a relatively
quick, humane death?

36:05.954 --> 36:07.820
Maybe he got the
information he wanted.

36:07.856 --> 36:09.589
Maybe.

36:09.624 --> 36:11.035
But there's a cruelty to
this killer, it doesn't fit.

36:11.059 --> 36:12.492
BRENNAN:
I agree.

36:12.527 --> 36:17.397
Cause of death was a transected
cervical spinal cord.

36:17.432 --> 36:19.966
We need to understand
how that was done.

36:20.001 --> 36:24.470
Okay, well, all we have is
a bloodstained table

36:24.506 --> 36:26.272
and a few strips of duct tape.

36:26.308 --> 36:28.524
I have enhanced
the stains here.

36:28.525 --> 36:30.610
Well, the largest concentration
of blood will be

36:30.645 --> 36:32.278
where the rat cage was
fixed to the ribs.

36:32.314 --> 36:35.048
Can you align the body
accordingly?

36:35.083 --> 36:36.249
Yeah, I'll center the stain

36:36.284 --> 36:37.850
on the eighth
and ninth rib.

36:40.989 --> 36:43.356
The remaining tape matches up
with the arms and legs.

36:46.828 --> 36:48.995
Uh, this doesn't make sense.

36:49.030 --> 36:51.664
The skull would need more
range of motion

36:51.700 --> 36:55.168
for the spinal column
to be transected.

36:55.203 --> 36:59.372
Okay, let me recreate
the fracture to the C2.

37:02.811 --> 37:03.910
SAROYAN:
You're right.

37:03.945 --> 37:04.877
His skull would have had to go

37:04.913 --> 37:06.145
right through the table.

37:06.181 --> 37:08.181
The body is
in the wrong position.

37:08.216 --> 37:09.682
Was that tape torn?

37:09.718 --> 37:11.017
I'm sure this is important.

37:11.052 --> 37:12.785
But why?
Because if I'm the killer

37:12.821 --> 37:14.887
and I want to get a dead body
off my table,

37:14.923 --> 37:16.756
I'd cut the tape.

37:19.227 --> 37:20.827
BRENNAN:
It was torn.

37:20.862 --> 37:24.130
Which suggests
Aldo tried to break free.

37:24.165 --> 37:26.699
So perhaps he was killed
somewhere else.

37:26.735 --> 37:28.646
They're at the sound studio,
combing through the wreckage.

37:28.670 --> 37:30.837
What's left?
What's left

37:30.872 --> 37:32.116
is you could fit
into a beer can,

37:32.140 --> 37:33.373
that's what's left.

37:33.408 --> 37:34.585
So we're back where we started.

37:34.609 --> 37:35.908
Who is this guy?

37:35.944 --> 37:38.023
And why did he target
Aldo Clemens?

37:38.024 --> 37:39.379
Yeah. (phone ringing)
Hold on.

37:39.414 --> 37:41.948
(Booth groans)

37:41.983 --> 37:43.583
(phone beeps)
Yeah?

37:43.618 --> 37:45.418
There's one possible
explanation for

37:45.453 --> 37:46.719
how Aldo died.

37:46.755 --> 37:48.065
Well, look,
does it get us any closer

37:48.089 --> 37:49.289
to finding out who killed him?

37:49.324 --> 37:51.591
Well, let me show
you what we have.

37:51.626 --> 37:53.226
All right, hold on.

37:54.229 --> 37:55.995
What do you got?
(sighs)

37:56.031 --> 37:58.031
BRENNAN:
From the position of the body

37:58.066 --> 37:59.699
and the fractures,
the killer couldn't

37:59.734 --> 38:01.968
have snapped Aldo's neck
while he was restrained.

38:02.003 --> 38:03.202
So what's left?

38:03.238 --> 38:05.238
SAROYAN:
The most likely explanation

38:05.273 --> 38:07.540
is that Aldo
killed himself.

38:07.575 --> 38:08.586
He was fastened
to the table

38:08.610 --> 38:09.976
by duct tape,

38:10.011 --> 38:11.744
but he managed to loosen it.

38:11.780 --> 38:12.823
MONTENEGRO:
Not enough to escape,

38:12.847 --> 38:13.913
but enough to give him

38:13.948 --> 38:15.848
some range of movement.

38:15.884 --> 38:17.917
If he pushed himself back
onto the table,

38:17.952 --> 38:20.286
he could raise his upper torso,

38:20.321 --> 38:23.056
which made it possible for him
to generate

38:23.091 --> 38:24.424
a whiplike motion.

38:24.459 --> 38:26.426
And sever his spinal cord.

38:26.461 --> 38:27.660
I don't know.

38:27.696 --> 38:29.362
The man was once a priest.

38:29.397 --> 38:32.432
And suicide is
a cardinal sin.

38:32.467 --> 38:33.833
It wasn't a suicide.

38:33.868 --> 38:38.871
Booth, the facts
clearly indicate that it was.

38:38.907 --> 38:41.507
A sacrifice, it was a sacrifice.

38:41.543 --> 38:43.009
"Sacrifice"?

38:43.044 --> 38:45.244
He was trying
to protect someone.

38:48.583 --> 38:50.483
♪ If you figure me out ♪

38:50.518 --> 38:52.885
♪ You better keep

AUBREY:
Look, so, um,

39:05.066 --> 39:06.966
sorry that I haven't been
exactly present.

39:07.001 --> 39:08.167
JESSICA:
Oh, well,

39:08.203 --> 39:09.535
we've all been
working hard.

39:09.571 --> 39:10.815
I haven't been that available,
either. (chuckles)

39:10.839 --> 39:13.139
No, I'm talking
mentally present.

39:13.174 --> 39:15.341
I've been distracted.

39:15.376 --> 39:17.410
Oh, yeah, it's--

39:17.445 --> 39:18.811
it's about your father.

39:18.847 --> 39:20.680
No, I-I understand.

39:20.715 --> 39:22.526
You must be worried about
what happens when they find him.

39:22.550 --> 39:24.183
I am.

39:24.219 --> 39:27.220
It's not as cut and dry
as I thought it was gonna be.

39:27.255 --> 39:29.222
Well, I'm glad you're
seeing that now.

39:29.257 --> 39:31.357
(exhales forcefully)
Look, there's something else

39:31.392 --> 39:33.392
that I've been thinking about.

39:33.428 --> 39:35.528
I want you to know that...

39:36.431 --> 39:38.131
I'm not him.

39:38.166 --> 39:40.933
Uh, I know that, Aubrey.
(chuckles anxiously)

39:40.969 --> 39:42.635
He left his wife,
he left me.

39:42.670 --> 39:45.838
You know, I would--
I would never ever do that.

39:45.874 --> 39:47.039
What are you saying?

39:47.075 --> 39:49.942
I'm saying that...

39:49.978 --> 39:51.477
when I commit to something,

39:51.513 --> 39:53.146
it's real.

39:53.181 --> 39:55.515
That I'm serious about us.

39:57.685 --> 39:59.051
Did I say the wrong thing?

39:59.087 --> 40:01.387
No.

40:01.422 --> 40:03.523
Of course not, Aubrey...

40:03.558 --> 40:04.924
(sighs)

40:04.959 --> 40:06.859
...but there's a lot going on.

40:06.895 --> 40:08.427
I know.

40:08.463 --> 40:10.263
And when it's all taken care of,

40:10.298 --> 40:12.398
I'm gonna feel the same way.

40:28.049 --> 40:29.760
BRENNAN: I know this
is difficult, Booth, but...

40:29.784 --> 40:31.083
(groans)

40:31.119 --> 40:33.252
...you're gonna get through it.

40:33.288 --> 40:35.221
Yeah,

40:35.256 --> 40:37.056
sounds like something
Aldo would have said.

40:38.526 --> 40:40.493
He was right.
(Booth groans)

40:40.528 --> 40:41.794
Yeah, but this
is different.

40:41.830 --> 40:43.729
Bones, he, um...

40:46.067 --> 40:47.834
he died...

40:47.869 --> 40:49.902
'cause he was trying
to protect me.

40:49.938 --> 40:51.504
What do you mean?

40:51.539 --> 40:52.872
You know that X-ray

40:52.907 --> 40:55.875
that we saw in
the sound studio?

40:55.910 --> 40:57.743
I know who that was.

40:57.779 --> 41:00.813
There was no name on it.
I looked for that.

41:00.849 --> 41:03.249
He died of a gunshot
wound in the head.

41:03.284 --> 41:04.483
Center core.

41:04.519 --> 41:06.619
3,000 feet away.

41:06.654 --> 41:08.554
I'm the one who
made that shot.

41:09.524 --> 41:11.958
That is a ridiculous assumption.

41:11.993 --> 41:13.659
There are other snipers
capable...

41:13.695 --> 41:14.894
Bosnia.

41:14.929 --> 41:17.897
1995.

41:17.932 --> 41:20.032
The general-- remember,
I told you about him?

41:20.068 --> 41:23.069
The warlord
that you had to shoot.

41:24.572 --> 41:26.672
You saved a lot of lives
doing that.

41:26.708 --> 41:28.441
I killed him...

41:28.476 --> 41:29.742
I, uh...

41:29.777 --> 41:33.012
I killed him right
in front of his own son.

41:33.047 --> 41:34.647
He's got allies and family.

41:34.682 --> 41:36.749
This is about revenge.

41:36.784 --> 41:40.453
You-you can't know that, Booth.
It was just one X-ray.

41:40.488 --> 41:43.089
I mean, Aldo knew that
I was the shooter.

41:43.992 --> 41:45.958
He killed himself

41:45.994 --> 41:49.295
so he wouldn't have to
give me up.

41:49.330 --> 41:52.732
That's one possibility.
There are others.

41:52.767 --> 41:54.767
It's the only thing
that makes sense, Bones.

41:54.802 --> 41:57.036
And whoever this is,
they're not gonna stop

41:57.071 --> 41:59.672
until...

41:59.707 --> 42:01.474
What should we do?

42:01.509 --> 42:03.442
Just be ready.
