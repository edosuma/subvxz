00:00.743 --> 00:02.431
I want a real babysitter.

00:02.451 --> 00:04.758
You don't need a babysitter anymore.

00:04.778 --> 00:07.131
Your sister's old enough
to start watching you.

00:07.151 --> 00:09.023
Babysitters are fun.

00:09.043 --> 00:11.024
Babysitters are expensive.

00:11.044 --> 00:13.053
And I can pay your sister half.

00:13.087 --> 00:14.421
Can I get paid, too?

00:14.455 --> 00:15.655
For what?

00:15.689 --> 00:17.421
For being great.

00:17.840 --> 00:18.791
How about if Ella says

00:18.826 --> 00:21.714
that you are actually "great,"
I will give you five dollars?

00:21.734 --> 00:22.784
Here's the problem.

00:22.804 --> 00:24.297
Ella lies.

00:24.332 --> 00:25.765
We already know I'm gonna be great.

00:25.799 --> 00:27.896
I think I should get the money now.

00:27.916 --> 00:29.416
Will you take a check?

00:29.436 --> 00:31.949
Well,
let's see if we can find Mom's checkbook.

00:35.299 --> 00:37.145
Can you believe this
is our first night ever

00:37.165 --> 00:39.311
- without a babysitter?
- I know.

00:39.346 --> 00:40.312
It's a new era.

00:40.347 --> 00:41.413
Think she can handle it?

00:41.448 --> 00:43.913
Probably not.

00:44.456 --> 00:45.677
Shit!

00:45.697 --> 00:48.252
Baby! Oh, my God! What the...?!

01:03.272 --> 01:05.501
That truck came out of nowhere.

01:05.536 --> 01:07.337
- We almost died.
- I know.

01:07.372 --> 01:09.306
I had to throw out my underwear.

01:09.616 --> 01:10.874
I feel like we should go home.

01:10.908 --> 01:13.619
Hey, will you please keep it down?

01:13.639 --> 01:16.814
My lady friend and I are trying
to enjoy the entertainment.

01:22.886 --> 01:24.720
- What do you think?
- Not bad.

01:24.754 --> 01:26.222
Yeah, they sound great.

01:26.256 --> 01:27.456
You like working with them?

01:27.491 --> 01:29.392
I do. They're young.

01:29.426 --> 01:32.061
So the asshole-to-talent
ratio is still manageable.

01:33.397 --> 01:35.131
Very cool.

01:36.266 --> 01:38.725
Uh, so, where is Jess?

01:38.895 --> 01:40.519
She's, uh...

01:40.539 --> 01:42.370
You know,
I forgot which excuse she used this time.

01:42.405 --> 01:43.671
Yeah.

01:44.061 --> 01:45.540
Is everything okay?

01:45.984 --> 01:48.298
Well, hey, you would know better than me.

01:49.078 --> 01:50.445
I... I really don't.

01:50.479 --> 01:52.313
I don't know anything.

01:53.324 --> 01:55.930
Well, that makes two of us.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.717
When that truck almost hit us,

01:57.752 --> 01:59.453
all I could think about was the girls.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.055
They're alone tonight.

02:01.089 --> 02:03.757
I just keep imagining the cops
walking up to our front door

02:03.791 --> 02:06.049
and telling the girls they're orphans.

02:06.406 --> 02:08.228
Wait, uh, who's an orphan?

02:08.263 --> 02:09.895
I'm an orphan.

02:09.931 --> 02:11.697
- My parents are worthless.
- Oh.

02:11.731 --> 02:13.433
That's not what an orphan is.

02:14.183 --> 02:15.268
- Listen.
- I know.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.437
Russ and I don't have wills!

02:17.471 --> 02:19.705
You see, if anything happens to us,

02:19.739 --> 02:22.075
we don't have a plan
for who gets the girls.

02:22.109 --> 02:23.342
My ex gets Chase.

02:23.377 --> 02:26.240
Roxanne and her husband get Caitlin.

02:26.260 --> 02:29.181
This is what makes divorce great...
you're less likely to die together.

02:29.215 --> 02:31.116
Maybe you and Russ
should just get divorced.

02:31.150 --> 02:32.451
Oh, for the kids.

02:32.485 --> 02:35.720
I'm starting to think you
guys are good for each other.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.439
Can I come in?

02:40.625 --> 02:42.927
Oh...
mm, I don't think that's such a good idea.

02:42.962 --> 02:44.862
You know, Chase has karate in the morning,

02:44.897 --> 02:47.764
and if he sees you, he'll just...

02:47.799 --> 02:50.201
he'll get confused.

02:50.725 --> 02:52.954
I could pretend to be the exterminator.

02:52.974 --> 02:55.372
I'm here about your mice, ma'am. Hmm?

02:55.407 --> 02:57.241
How do you know about my mice?

02:57.275 --> 02:59.343
I know you.

02:59.377 --> 03:02.312
I know... you.

03:05.038 --> 03:06.583
Let me meet your kid.

03:06.617 --> 03:10.002
Um... I don't think so.

03:10.022 --> 03:11.154
I made that mistake before.

03:11.188 --> 03:14.924
Introduced him to a few
guys who were bad choices.

03:14.958 --> 03:16.859
You know, I've made some bad choices.

03:16.893 --> 03:18.361
Me, too.

03:18.395 --> 03:19.928
Every choice I make is bad.

03:19.962 --> 03:21.363
We're perfect for each other.

03:21.397 --> 03:22.531
Oh.

03:22.565 --> 03:23.732
- Chase, Chase, wake up!
- Oh. Shh!

03:23.766 --> 03:25.000
It's time to meet your new daddy.

03:25.034 --> 03:26.868
Oh, God, you're crazy.

03:26.902 --> 03:30.472
Hey, I've been very up front about that.

03:31.083 --> 03:33.074
I like it.

03:35.814 --> 03:37.545
You stay there.

03:38.007 --> 03:39.813
Bye.

03:41.962 --> 03:44.752
Kiss Chase for me.

03:45.654 --> 03:47.353
What are you doing?

03:47.373 --> 03:49.557
I'm working on a spreadsheet.

03:50.028 --> 03:51.560
It's a list of friends and relatives

03:51.580 --> 03:55.094
that we might want to consider
leaving the kids with if we die.

03:55.129 --> 03:59.042
This column is my comment section.

03:59.062 --> 04:03.657
"Too bitchy, too crazy,
"too broke, too sleazy,

04:03.677 --> 04:04.762
too in jail."

04:04.782 --> 04:07.740
Yep, that's everyone we know.

04:07.775 --> 04:09.742
Until we figure this out,
I really don't think

04:09.777 --> 04:11.510
we should travel together.

04:11.545 --> 04:13.679
Separate cars, separate planes.

04:13.713 --> 04:14.846
Separate yachts?

04:14.881 --> 04:16.348
Everything is separate

04:16.382 --> 04:18.350
until we figure out who gets the kids.

04:18.385 --> 04:20.586
- Oh, I have an idea.
- Who?

04:20.620 --> 04:22.354
Valerie, Jess's nanny.

04:22.389 --> 04:24.122
What about her?

04:24.157 --> 04:25.724
I trust her more than anybody

04:25.758 --> 04:27.358
that we're actually friends with.

04:27.393 --> 04:28.726
What's going on with them?

04:28.760 --> 04:30.828
I have... I have no clue.

04:30.862 --> 04:33.298
- I thought Jess told you everything.
- Yeah.

04:33.332 --> 04:34.865
Honestly,
I don't want to know anything anymore.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.901
It makes it too hard with Shep.

04:36.935 --> 04:39.937
I feel like a jackass when I know
something he doesn't.

04:39.971 --> 04:42.407
So, Jess isn't so fun anymore?

04:42.441 --> 04:43.841
I don't know.

04:44.775 --> 04:47.844
Maybe I'm not so fun anymore.

04:52.950 --> 04:55.552
Look at all this acid wash!

04:55.587 --> 04:56.820
How did that come back?

04:56.854 --> 04:58.255
Everything comes back.

04:58.289 --> 05:01.191
Hey, how much you get paid
for something like this?

05:01.225 --> 05:03.559
The real money's in Vegas.
That is next level.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.361
You're next level.

05:05.395 --> 05:08.030
Can you tell my manager that, please?

05:08.064 --> 05:09.865
I think you have the wrong manager, babe.

05:09.899 --> 05:11.634
Hey, my set's about to be over.

05:11.668 --> 05:13.636
Want to get some breakfast?

05:13.670 --> 05:15.471
Do I want to get some breakfast?

05:15.505 --> 05:17.306
What time is it?

05:17.341 --> 05:18.673
Oh, shit!

05:18.708 --> 05:19.974
Shit on my life!

05:20.008 --> 05:22.009
I have to take my kid to day care.

05:22.044 --> 05:23.778
What?

05:29.830 --> 05:31.937
So you stay there until 6:00 in the morning

05:31.971 --> 05:34.139
so that I could manage some deejay?

05:34.173 --> 05:37.396
No,
I got him to agree to sit down with you,

05:37.416 --> 05:38.744
which could really help us.

05:38.778 --> 05:40.010
You know what would help?

05:40.045 --> 05:41.678
Don't set off the burglar alarm

05:41.713 --> 05:44.454
when you come crawling home at dawn.

05:44.474 --> 05:46.432
You changed the code.

05:46.452 --> 05:47.818
Same code.

05:47.853 --> 05:50.955
Well, I'm allowed to go out.

05:50.989 --> 05:52.656
I'm allowed to shit my pants.

05:52.690 --> 05:54.158
Doesn't make it a good decision.

05:57.089 --> 05:58.949
God...

05:58.969 --> 06:00.908
Are you okay?

06:00.928 --> 06:01.597
I'm fine.

06:01.632 --> 06:03.432
I haven't been sleeping well.

06:03.467 --> 06:05.568
Is that insomnia or Molly?

06:05.602 --> 06:07.403
A little bit of both.

06:07.437 --> 06:09.005
- Mm-hmm.
- I got us a new hookup.

06:09.039 --> 06:11.074
Do you remember that deejay
we ran into the other night?

06:11.108 --> 06:13.056
Yeah, the one that you blew me off for?

06:13.076 --> 06:14.576
I was networking!

06:14.610 --> 06:16.078
Is that what they call it now?

06:16.112 --> 06:18.914
Oh, shut up.
This is really big; it's important.

06:18.948 --> 06:22.717
How would you like to have your designs
projected at one of his shows?

06:22.752 --> 06:24.120
That's like...

06:24.140 --> 06:26.078
What are you talking about?

06:27.123 --> 06:28.909
Never mind.

06:29.433 --> 06:30.992
So, how is Lina?

06:31.026 --> 06:32.226
She's good.

06:32.261 --> 06:33.961
She's a little obsessed.

06:33.996 --> 06:35.229
"Obsessed"?

06:35.599 --> 06:39.042
Trying to figure out who
gets the kids if we die.

06:39.062 --> 06:40.496
Both our families suck.

06:40.516 --> 06:43.404
Mmm. Dark.

06:44.297 --> 06:45.606
Well, am I in the mix?

06:45.640 --> 06:47.508
I mean, they should just go to me.

06:47.542 --> 06:49.242
I'm like family.

06:49.277 --> 06:51.278
Yeah, yeah.

06:53.992 --> 06:55.882
"But, of course,
Lina would never allow that"...

06:55.917 --> 06:59.019
is that the second part to
the sentence I should say?

07:00.922 --> 07:02.923
You know,
the girls have been asking about you,

07:02.957 --> 07:05.624
so why don't you and Shep come
over this weekend for the game?

07:05.658 --> 07:07.259
Yeah, I'd love to.

07:07.294 --> 07:08.527
Is that okay with Lina?

07:08.561 --> 07:10.362
Stop being so weird.

07:10.396 --> 07:11.831
I'm not.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.999
I'm not being weird.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.201
You are.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.235
No, I'm not.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.938
Ordering a salad at a grilled cheese truck?

07:18.972 --> 07:20.667
Weird.

07:23.673 --> 07:25.825
Can we go? We've been here, like, forever.

07:25.845 --> 07:28.079
Hang on,
just wait until the class is over, okay?

07:30.763 --> 07:32.550
Oh, okay, stand up, come on.

07:32.584 --> 07:34.018
Come with me.

07:34.447 --> 07:35.553
Jesus! Hi!

07:35.587 --> 07:36.721
Hey!

07:36.755 --> 07:38.956
Fancy meeting you here.

07:38.990 --> 07:40.858
What are you doing here?

07:41.175 --> 07:43.462
Hey,
who's this cool dude with you?

07:43.482 --> 07:45.162
This is my son Chase.

07:45.196 --> 07:46.496
And we have to go.

07:46.530 --> 07:47.731
Oh.

07:47.970 --> 07:50.901
Say, I just had a crazy idea.

07:50.935 --> 07:53.503
We got these two cool kids
with us on a Saturday.

07:53.537 --> 07:55.005
Should we go play mini golf?

07:55.039 --> 07:56.505
There's a course five
minutes away from here.

07:56.539 --> 07:57.740
We could get to know each other.

07:57.774 --> 07:59.775
I love mini golf! Can we?

07:59.809 --> 08:00.776
Huh?

08:00.810 --> 08:01.911
Yeah, I love it, too!

08:01.945 --> 08:03.212
- You love it, too, right?
- Excuse me.

08:03.247 --> 08:04.413
Sure.

08:04.447 --> 08:05.514
No, not "sure"... yes.

08:05.548 --> 08:06.682
You love it.

08:06.716 --> 08:08.433
So we're gonna go, huh?

08:09.694 --> 08:11.453
Sure.

08:11.488 --> 08:13.262
Guess so.

08:22.315 --> 08:24.099
When did you get a tattoo?

08:24.133 --> 08:25.333
Hmm? Oh.

08:25.368 --> 08:27.318
I just... I don't know.
Had this for a while, I think.

08:27.338 --> 08:29.218
Huh.

08:29.238 --> 08:30.237
Hey, guys.

08:30.272 --> 08:31.005
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:31.039 --> 08:32.239
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

08:32.274 --> 08:33.274
Yeah.

08:37.082 --> 08:40.126
Wow, your highlights have really grown out.

08:41.445 --> 08:43.183
I mean your hair's long.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.985
You know.

08:45.020 --> 08:46.720
We haven't seen you in a while.

08:46.754 --> 08:48.813
Sorry. We've been busy.

08:48.833 --> 08:50.623
Did you know I went back to teaching?

08:50.657 --> 08:52.191
Well, technically I'm a teaching assistant,
but...

08:52.226 --> 08:54.860
Oh, no, everyone's busy; I get it.

08:54.895 --> 08:57.897
Did Russ mention that I offered

08:57.932 --> 09:00.599
to take care of the girls if you died?

09:00.634 --> 09:02.535
He did actually, yeah.

09:03.352 --> 09:04.399
And?

09:04.419 --> 09:06.671
We decided not to die.

09:07.580 --> 09:09.641
Great plan.

09:10.178 --> 09:12.144
Okay, well, uh,

09:12.178 --> 09:15.413
I have a little present that I brought
for the girls if I could...

09:15.433 --> 09:17.236
Yeah, they're in Ella's room.

09:17.256 --> 09:20.086
It's the end of the
hallway in case you forgot.

09:25.456 --> 09:27.458
- Look at them.
- Pretty cute.

09:27.492 --> 09:29.427
They're laughing. They're taking turns.

09:29.461 --> 09:31.495
They're like brother and sister already.

09:31.529 --> 09:32.863
But without the incest factor.

09:32.897 --> 09:34.031
Aw, that's...

09:34.066 --> 09:35.399
We dodged a bullet there.

09:37.836 --> 09:39.769
How did you know where to find me?

09:39.803 --> 09:42.538
I know you.

09:43.603 --> 09:46.609
You know, getting ambushed
like that was pretty intense.

09:46.643 --> 09:49.045
Oh, I'm also a cutter, so...

09:49.080 --> 09:50.613
Oh, really?

09:50.647 --> 09:53.616
Well, um, I just need you to know

09:53.650 --> 09:55.884
Chase is the most important
thing in the world to me.

09:55.918 --> 09:57.052
Relax.

09:57.087 --> 09:58.653
Neither of them suspect a thing.

09:58.688 --> 09:59.654
- Okay.
- Okay?

09:59.689 --> 10:00.689
- Mom?
- Yeah, honey?

10:00.723 --> 10:03.158
Can your boyfriend come over
for dinner tonight?

10:03.193 --> 10:04.726
Oh, he's not my boyfriend.

10:04.760 --> 10:06.613
Hey, little buddy.
How could I be?

10:06.633 --> 10:08.897
- I'm 40 days celibate.
- AJ!

10:09.328 --> 10:11.133
No. What's "celibate"?

10:11.167 --> 10:12.166
It's nothing. It's not even a thing

10:12.201 --> 10:13.891
we need to start worrying about.

10:13.911 --> 10:18.389
Sometimes when you
love cookies so much,

10:18.409 --> 10:20.241
it's better to not eat any

10:20.275 --> 10:22.481
because you end up eating the whole box.

10:22.501 --> 10:24.612
Just like the Cookie Monster.

10:25.254 --> 10:26.114
Yeah.

10:26.148 --> 10:27.948
Like Cookie Monster.

10:27.983 --> 10:29.949
Like Cookie Monster.

10:29.984 --> 10:31.018
You like him, right?

10:31.052 --> 10:32.352
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:32.387 --> 10:33.887
"C" is for "celibate."

10:33.921 --> 10:36.390
"Cookies." It's for "cookies," AJ.

10:41.144 --> 10:43.730
And gorgeous, gorgeous,

10:43.764 --> 10:44.998
gorgeous...

10:45.033 --> 10:46.698
I want polka dots on my nails, too.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.254
Okay, you're next.

10:48.274 --> 10:50.406
You're so much better
at makeup than our mom.

10:50.426 --> 10:52.516
Well, you know what, girls?
If you want to get noticed,

10:52.536 --> 10:55.228
you really have to put in the work.
It's a real thing, okay?

10:55.248 --> 10:58.315
And the older you get,
the harder it is to be cute.

10:58.335 --> 11:01.029
That's just... a sad truth.

11:01.049 --> 11:03.454
I wish my mom had style like you.

11:03.474 --> 11:06.394
You know, she has other stuff.
She just doesn't really care about that.

11:06.414 --> 11:08.723
But luckily, I do. And I'm here.

11:08.743 --> 11:10.828
I can help you with, you know, your prom,

11:10.848 --> 11:12.888
I can help you with your weddings

11:12.959 --> 11:14.559
when you meet that special prince.

11:17.673 --> 11:19.010
Yeah.

11:19.030 --> 11:19.873
You know what?

11:19.893 --> 11:21.565
You guys should come and
stay with me for a weekend.

11:21.599 --> 11:23.100
We haven't done that in so long.

11:23.135 --> 11:25.435
- Yeah, that'd be really cool.
- Totally.

11:25.470 --> 11:27.757
Yeah. Just us.

11:28.874 --> 11:29.640
But you know what?

11:29.675 --> 11:31.441
You probably got to ask your
mom about that, actually,

11:31.476 --> 11:33.477
'cause she's not my biggest fan.

11:34.021 --> 11:36.033
You know that, though, right?

11:36.053 --> 11:39.415
Little whisperings around the house?

11:39.449 --> 11:42.487
Your dad used to love me.

11:43.278 --> 11:46.222
And now I think he's sort of...

11:46.256 --> 11:48.722
over me as well.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.727
That's mean.

11:50.761 --> 11:52.379
You know what? It is kind of mean,

11:52.399 --> 11:54.863
because it's mean to not be honest,

11:54.898 --> 11:56.079
and a lot of times when adults

11:56.099 --> 11:57.833
don't want to be friends
with someone anymore,

11:57.867 --> 11:59.234
they don't even say it.

11:59.268 --> 12:01.837
They just...
they just say that they're busy.

12:01.871 --> 12:03.371
You know? And they just blow people off

12:03.406 --> 12:07.642
and they don't answer text
messages anymore and, um...

12:07.899 --> 12:10.382
and they-they really let it...

12:11.046 --> 12:12.413
fizzle out.

12:12.447 --> 12:14.148
Hey, so how's the teaching going?

12:14.183 --> 12:15.282
It is going great.

12:15.317 --> 12:17.919
I can speak for myself,
thank you very much.

12:17.953 --> 12:20.196
Kind of talking to her.

12:20.216 --> 12:21.022
It's good.

12:21.056 --> 12:23.420
I used to hate 12 kids;
now I'm down to seven.

12:23.440 --> 12:25.297
- So, better.
- Definitely.

12:25.317 --> 12:27.228
- Thank you for asking.
- Yeah. Well, that's good.

12:27.861 --> 12:29.262
Baby!

12:29.296 --> 12:30.530
Hey, hey, hey. What?

12:30.564 --> 12:32.917
Why do you guys hate Aunt Jess?

12:33.507 --> 12:34.968
Great.

12:35.002 --> 12:38.254
Another place we won't get invited back.

12:43.792 --> 12:46.436
I can't believe this.

12:46.456 --> 12:48.256
Just explain to me what happened in there.

12:48.291 --> 12:50.158
- What did you say?
- What did I say?

12:50.193 --> 12:51.393
Well, what-what... why...

12:51.427 --> 12:52.561
Whose side are you taking?

12:52.596 --> 12:54.096
You made a kid cry.

12:54.130 --> 12:56.131
You're gonna believe a
child over your own wife?

12:56.165 --> 12:57.399
What is happening?

12:57.433 --> 12:59.034
I'm worried about you.

13:02.308 --> 13:03.771
I think we should go back into therapy.

13:03.806 --> 13:05.540
Yeah.

13:05.574 --> 13:07.609
I mean, not much of a point for me,

13:07.643 --> 13:09.010
since they always love you.

13:09.044 --> 13:10.444
That's so not true.

13:10.479 --> 13:12.446
- Please. You always win therapy.
- I win?

13:12.481 --> 13:13.915
What, exactly, did I win?

13:13.949 --> 13:16.302
How much longer do you
think that marriage lasts?

13:16.322 --> 13:18.118
I'll take the under.

13:18.152 --> 13:19.386
There's a nice idea.

13:19.420 --> 13:21.121
Maybe we can kick the dog on the way out.

13:21.155 --> 13:24.090
Hey, you know, we're gonna,
uh, take off early.

13:24.125 --> 13:25.425
Jess isn't feeling great.

13:25.459 --> 13:26.660
- Oh...
- Oh... Feel better.

13:26.694 --> 13:29.396
No, I'm actually feeling fine.

13:29.430 --> 13:31.364
And also, we don't have to do this.

13:31.399 --> 13:32.733
We don't have to pretend.

13:32.767 --> 13:36.035
I understand how everybody feels about me.

13:36.069 --> 13:38.270
You know? I get it.
I'm really inappropriate

13:38.304 --> 13:40.506
and I do too much coke and
I party too hard and...

13:40.541 --> 13:43.976
Look, why don't you just
quit while you're ahead, okay?

13:47.124 --> 13:49.059
I mean...

13:49.079 --> 13:51.013
you're gonna miss me.

13:58.367 --> 14:00.759
I enjoyed the wings.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.195
That was fun, huh?

14:04.229 --> 14:05.597
Mm-hmm.

14:05.631 --> 14:07.665
Do you follow a lot of women?

14:07.699 --> 14:10.220
On Instagram, yes, I...

14:10.240 --> 14:12.803
But in real life.

14:12.837 --> 14:14.672
I know I'm intense.

14:15.044 --> 14:17.240
I... I'm an Aries. I run hot.

14:17.697 --> 14:19.643
I need you to cool it down a bit.

14:21.646 --> 14:23.400
Whoa, whoa.

14:23.420 --> 14:24.847
What do you mean?

14:25.401 --> 14:27.784
I just want to slow things down.

14:30.179 --> 14:32.273
I get it.

14:32.756 --> 14:34.824
You're mad at me because I
haven't had sex with you yet.

14:35.172 --> 14:36.630
No. I...

14:36.909 --> 14:38.160
No, I just think

14:38.195 --> 14:42.230
it's a little early
for you to have a relationship with my son.

14:43.548 --> 14:46.201
Take a beat before we blend the families?

14:46.235 --> 14:48.070
I think that's a good idea.

14:48.508 --> 14:50.072
What do we tell Chase?

14:50.106 --> 14:51.573
I don't think we need to tell him anything.

14:51.608 --> 14:53.374
- I know exactly what to say.
- Say nothing.

14:53.409 --> 14:54.542
- Chase...
- Yeah?

14:54.577 --> 14:56.411
Come here.

14:56.445 --> 14:57.879
Hey, little buddy.

14:57.914 --> 15:00.715
Cookie Monster is on a diet right now.

15:00.749 --> 15:02.599
Just lean meats and veggies.

15:02.619 --> 15:03.964
No cookies?

15:03.984 --> 15:05.419
No.

15:05.717 --> 15:08.623
No cookies.

15:09.145 --> 15:12.727
But I'll see you when
it's time for a cookie.

15:13.771 --> 15:14.895
How's that sound?

15:14.930 --> 15:16.730
Okay.

15:21.736 --> 15:24.179
And I'll see you when
it's time for a cookie.

15:24.381 --> 15:26.673
Maybe we could have a few dinners

15:26.707 --> 15:28.274
before that cookie.

15:28.308 --> 15:30.176
Slowing things down.

15:30.210 --> 15:31.892
- Of course.
- Yeah.

15:37.430 --> 15:38.817
All the times that we took them

15:38.852 --> 15:40.653
out to dinner when they were broke.

15:40.687 --> 15:43.789
And that I've sat there
and watched their girls.

15:43.823 --> 15:45.858
And then they just turn
around and treat me like this

15:45.892 --> 15:47.592
because it's just so
easy for them to do it!

15:47.627 --> 15:49.827
You weren't the best guest.

15:50.963 --> 15:51.980
Okay.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.631
That's really perfect for me.

15:53.666 --> 15:55.232
So you're just gonna attack me as well?

15:55.267 --> 15:56.768
I'm not attacking you.

15:56.802 --> 15:58.469
Yeah, you are. You are attacking me.

15:58.503 --> 16:00.138
Didn't mean to attack you.

16:03.066 --> 16:04.970
You gonna get ready for bed,

16:04.990 --> 16:06.743
or you gonna turn into a bat now,

16:06.778 --> 16:08.745
- fly away for the night?
- Jesus Christ.

16:08.780 --> 16:11.636
Does it feel good to say
stuff like that to me?

16:11.656 --> 16:13.533
'Cause I certainly don't need it.

16:14.045 --> 16:15.585
I don't need it either.

16:15.891 --> 16:17.353
Meaning what?

16:17.613 --> 16:18.555
Meaning

16:18.589 --> 16:20.557
maybe enough is enough.

16:20.881 --> 16:23.293
You're not happy here.

16:23.327 --> 16:27.229
I'm...
I'm tired of being treated like an asshole.

16:28.094 --> 16:29.718
I'm not an asshole.

16:29.738 --> 16:31.167
I know. I...

16:31.201 --> 16:33.557
I know, I don't think that you are.

16:34.379 --> 16:37.707
Well, if you want a new life
with someone else, fine.

16:37.741 --> 16:38.909
Go get it.

16:38.929 --> 16:40.309
Just stop blaming me.

16:40.343 --> 16:43.051
Stop blaming everybody else in the world.

16:43.454 --> 16:45.039
Take some responsibility,

16:45.059 --> 16:46.513
be an adult,

16:46.533 --> 16:48.950
and own it.

16:51.386 --> 16:53.431
I really just...

16:55.292 --> 16:57.358
I'm not trying to, like,
tear the world down,

16:57.392 --> 16:58.900
but I just wanted to...

16:58.920 --> 17:01.929
I want to be happy.

17:01.963 --> 17:04.034
I just want to be happy.

17:04.267 --> 17:06.108
Everybody wants to be happy.

17:06.127 --> 17:09.603
But it doesn't just... come like...

17:09.851 --> 17:11.070
Go ahead. Go be happy.

17:11.106 --> 17:13.454
I want you to be happy, I really do.

17:13.473 --> 17:15.608
- I...
- Go be happy.

17:16.012 --> 17:17.542
And, hey, if it gets too hard,

17:17.577 --> 17:19.859
then you can run away from that, too.

17:35.094 --> 17:36.928
What did Jess say?

17:36.963 --> 17:40.132
She said that they're done.

17:40.166 --> 17:44.136
That it's, like,
official official; it's over.

17:44.798 --> 17:46.929
- Isn't that crazy?
- Yeah.

17:46.949 --> 17:50.340
And she wants to, like, meet up and talk.

17:50.876 --> 17:52.436
What are you gonna do?

17:52.456 --> 17:54.804
I don't know.

17:54.824 --> 17:57.015
I guess...

17:57.883 --> 18:00.450
I'll go get a drink?

18:00.485 --> 18:02.502
Talk.

18:09.424 --> 18:11.161
Thank you.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.631
Wow.

18:15.666 --> 18:18.001
She was pretty hot, right?

18:19.770 --> 18:22.071
I've been single 11 minutes.

18:22.106 --> 18:23.288
Okay.

18:23.308 --> 18:24.940
So check back with you over the weekend?

18:24.974 --> 18:26.934
- That would be better.
- Okay.

18:26.954 --> 18:28.310
Um...

18:28.621 --> 18:31.246
This might not be the best
time to bring this up,

18:31.281 --> 18:35.038
but, uh... if Lina and I were to die,

18:35.058 --> 18:37.947
how would you feel about taking our kids?

18:39.088 --> 18:41.655
I've been single 11 minutes.

18:41.690 --> 18:42.990
Got it.

18:43.025 --> 18:44.926
- Let me enjoy this.
- Okay.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.828
After the beer, ask you again?

18:46.862 --> 18:49.013
- Bring it up.
- Okay.

19:21.442 --> 19:24.253
Aw... shit.
