WEBVTT

03:18.991 --> 03:21.451
You're wearing a black cloak again.

03:21.785 --> 03:24.204
I've been sent to negotiate with you.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.819
It appears my trusting nature
got the better of me.

03:56.612 --> 03:58.197
It's happened before.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.867
I was hoping your loyalty was real
when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.702
Truly, I was.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.579
The Halfhand ordered me to join your army

04:05.662 --> 04:08.373
and bring back whatever information
I could to Castle Black.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.918
He made me kill him so you'd trust me.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.586
I was loyal

04:12.669 --> 04:15.130
to him and to my Night's Watch vows.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.007
All your vows?

04:19.593 --> 04:23.013
She wasn't enough to turn you, eh?

04:23.305 --> 04:25.057
Were you enough to turn her?

04:26.016 --> 04:29.811
She put three arrows in me when I escaped.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.524
Did you see her again at Castle Black?

04:34.024 --> 04:35.067
Yes.

04:35.526 --> 04:36.735
And?

04:37.736 --> 04:38.862
She's dead.

04:40.197 --> 04:41.198
Your doing?

04:41.698 --> 04:43.158
No.

04:45.494 --> 04:46.787
We'll drink to her.

05:10.561 --> 05:14.690
Of all the ways I'd kill you,
poison would be the last.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.404
- Ygritte.
- Ygritte.

05:29.830 --> 05:30.956
That's not wine.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.001
No, it's a proper northern drink, Jon Snow.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.337
You did well. Fought hard.

05:37.546 --> 05:40.174
Killed some of our strongest men.

05:40.257 --> 05:44.803
One of our giants went into your tunnel
and never came out again.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.305
Mag the Mighty.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.348
He's dead.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.601
He killed my friend Grenn.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.019
He was their king.

05:52.102 --> 05:55.939
The last of a bloodline that stretches back
before the First Men.

05:56.607 --> 05:58.442
Grenn came from a farm.

06:03.155 --> 06:05.616
- Mag and Grenn.
- Grenn and Mag.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.121
Kullback, could I trouble you
for something to eat?

06:11.205 --> 06:15.792
I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything
for quite some time.

06:17.419 --> 06:21.131
So, you're here to strike a bargain?

06:22.799 --> 06:24.927
Turn your army around and go home.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.845
You know I know
you're low on arrows,

06:27.137 --> 06:29.306
you're low on oil, you're low on men.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.183
How many are left, 50?

06:31.433 --> 06:33.560
I told Tormund and Orell.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.103
We have more than 1,000 men.

06:35.187 --> 06:38.649
I showed you everything I had.
The whole army, 100,000 strong.

06:38.732 --> 06:42.277
And what did you do?
You fired on us with everything you had.

06:42.361 --> 06:43.445
It wasn't much.

06:43.529 --> 06:47.991
As soon as I saw that,
I sent 400 men to climb the Wall,

06:48.075 --> 06:50.577
an unmanned stretch five miles west of here.

06:50.661 --> 06:52.287
A lot of them will die climbing,

06:52.371 --> 06:54.498
but most of them will be over
by the end of the day.

06:55.165 --> 07:00.170
It's me being honest with you, Jon Snow,
which is more than you've ever done for me.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.631
My people have bled enough.

07:02.714 --> 07:03.841
We're not here to conquer.

07:04.049 --> 07:08.095
We're here to hide behind your Wall.
Just like you.

07:08.804 --> 07:10.556
We need your tunnel.

07:11.515 --> 07:14.768
Now we both know that winter is coming.

07:14.852 --> 07:18.105
And if my people aren't south of the Wall
when it comes in earnest,

07:18.188 --> 07:20.023
we'll all end up worse than dead.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.736
You want to strike a bargain with me?
Here's the bargain.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.905
You go back, you open the gates to us,

07:26.989 --> 07:30.284
and I swear to you that no one else will die.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.578
Refuse,

07:32.661 --> 07:35.205
and we'll kill every last man at Castle Black.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.667
Ah!

07:42.212 --> 07:43.839
Oh...

07:43.922 --> 07:45.465
That's why you're here.

07:46.675 --> 07:49.553
I reckon you could do it
before any of them could stop you.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.388
They'd kill you, of course.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.681
They'd kill you slow.

07:52.764 --> 07:56.476
But you knew that when you came in here.

07:57.186 --> 08:00.772
Are you capable of that, Jon Snow?

08:00.856 --> 08:04.276
Killing a man in his own tent
when he's just offered you peace?

08:04.359 --> 08:06.195
Is that what the Night's Watch is?

08:06.904 --> 08:09.239
Is that what you are?

08:11.074 --> 08:12.451
Riders coming!

08:15.078 --> 08:16.622
- Are you attacking us?
- No.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.249
It's like you said, we don't have the men.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.445
Hold! To me! To me!

10:00.893 --> 10:02.936
Stand down!

10:04.479 --> 10:06.982
I said my people have bled enough,

10:07.274 --> 10:09.067
and I meant it.

10:43.352 --> 10:44.895
Round them up.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.563
Stay with the horses.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.450
You're the King-beyond-the-Wall?

11:01.370 --> 11:03.997
- Do you know who I am?
- Never had the pleasure.

11:04.081 --> 11:07.084
This is Stannis Baratheon,
the one true king of the Seven Kingdoms.

11:07.167 --> 11:11.004
We're not in the Seven Kingdoms,
and you're not dressed for this weather.

11:11.088 --> 11:14.466
It is customary to kneel
when surrendering to a king.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.058
We do not kneel.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.018
I'll have thousands of your men
in chains by nightfall,

11:25.102 --> 11:27.688
have nowhere to put them,
have nothing to feed them.

11:28.272 --> 11:30.858
I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs.

11:30.941 --> 11:34.486
Their fate depends on their king.

11:34.570 --> 11:38.574
All the same, we do not kneel.

11:40.993 --> 11:42.619
Take these men away.

11:43.787 --> 11:47.207
What's a man of the Night's Watch
doing in a wildling camp?

11:48.125 --> 11:50.836
I was sent to discuss terms
with the King-beyond-the-Wall.

11:50.919 --> 11:53.255
You're speaking to the one true king, boy.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.132
You will address him as "Your Grace".

11:55.215 --> 11:58.218
I know he's the king. My father died for him.

12:00.637 --> 12:03.140
My name is Jon Snow, Your Grace.

12:03.974 --> 12:05.225
I'm Ned Stark's son.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.397
Your father was an honourable man.

12:10.522 --> 12:12.357
He was, Your Grace.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.318
What do you think he'd have done with him?

12:20.782 --> 12:23.368
I was this man's prisoner once.

12:23.452 --> 12:26.538
He could have tortured me.
He could have killed me.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.666
But he spared my life.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.960
I think my father would
have taken him prisoner,

12:32.044 --> 12:33.754
listened to what he had to say.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.843
Very well, then. Take him.

12:46.058 --> 12:47.100
Your Grace.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.896
If my father had seen the things that I've seen,

12:50.979 --> 12:54.858
he'd also tell you to
burn the dead before nightfall.

12:55.692 --> 12:56.985
All of them.

13:05.994 --> 13:09.540
I would suggest milk of the poppy
to ease his pain,

13:09.623 --> 13:12.417
- but he is completely insensate.
- Bloody Martells.

13:12.543 --> 13:14.711
The cause
appears to be manticore venom.

13:14.795 --> 13:17.840
It is. The Death's Head manticore.

13:18.715 --> 13:22.845
I've read a great deal about it.
It's a horrible poison.

13:22.928 --> 13:25.472
Usually Mantari in origin.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.558
Oh!

13:27.641 --> 13:28.851
There's nothing to be done.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.143
Yes, there is.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.731
May I ask what you think you're doing?

13:34.815 --> 13:35.858
Saving him.

13:35.941 --> 13:40.529
Your Grace, I wish it were
otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.115
Well, well beyond.

13:43.198 --> 13:47.619
This man is not even a maester,
let alone grand maester.

13:47.703 --> 13:50.789
That's for the best.
No maester knows how to save him.

13:50.956 --> 13:53.000
That is exactly the sort of arrogance

13:53.083 --> 13:55.919
that had him expelled
from the Citadel, Your Grace.

13:56.003 --> 14:00.299
His curiosity was deemed
dangerous and unnatural.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.092
Rightly so, in my opinion.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.428
You're dismissed, Grand Maester.

14:06.096 --> 14:10.184
But, Your Grace, this is my laboratory.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.978
- Not any more.
- But...

14:20.027 --> 14:22.696
- You can save him?
- Difficult to say, Your Grace.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.115
But if my past work is any guide...

14:27.701 --> 14:28.785
...we stand a chance.

14:29.953 --> 14:31.288
Do everything you can.

14:31.497 --> 14:33.040
Come to me for anything you need.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.708
Thank you, Your Grace.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.543
You should know,

14:36.627 --> 14:39.796
the process may change him

14:40.672 --> 14:42.299
somewhat.

14:45.302 --> 14:46.762
Will it weaken him?

14:48.096 --> 14:49.598
Oh, no.

14:50.015 --> 14:51.767
Very well, then.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.037
Not another word.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.873
We've been over this. The matter's closed.

15:14.957 --> 15:16.500
I'm opening it again.

15:18.168 --> 15:20.254
You were betrothed to Loras Tyrell.

15:21.213 --> 15:23.298
You're still betrothed to Loras Tyrell.

15:23.382 --> 15:28.011
And you will marry Loras Tyrell
as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.221
I will not.

15:29.763 --> 15:32.266
Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands.

15:32.349 --> 15:35.227
Tyrion's sentence
will be carried out tomorrow.

15:37.896 --> 15:40.941
You have on several occasions
made great claims

15:41.024 --> 15:43.777
about your commitment
to this family's future.

15:43.861 --> 15:47.406
Your role in that future
is more vital now than it ever was.

15:47.489 --> 15:49.366
I don't care.

15:49.491 --> 15:52.828
I will stay in King's Landing where I belong
with my son, the king.

15:52.911 --> 15:56.582
When you were nine years old,
I was called to the capital.

15:56.665 --> 15:58.917
I decided to take your brother with me
and not you.

15:59.376 --> 16:04.214
You insisted that you would not be left
at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.

16:04.298 --> 16:05.966
- If you recall...
- I'm not interested in hearing

16:06.049 --> 16:09.636
another one of your smug stories
about the time you won.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.972
This isn't going to be one of those times.

16:12.055 --> 16:13.640
Do you think you'll be the first person

16:13.724 --> 16:16.768
dragged into a Sept
to be married against her will?

16:16.852 --> 16:18.645
When you marched into the throne room
to tell me

16:18.729 --> 16:21.857
we'd won the Battle of Blackwater,
do you remember?

16:23.483 --> 16:26.111
I was sitting on the Iron Throne with Tommen.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.155
I was about to give him
essence of nightshade.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.698
That's how far I was willing to go

16:29.781 --> 16:32.701
when I thought someone awful
had come to take my son away.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.247
Someone awful is coming to take him away.

16:37.623 --> 16:38.665
No.

16:38.749 --> 16:41.793
Joffrey is dead.
Myrcella's been sold like livestock.

16:41.877 --> 16:45.005
And now you want to ship me off
to Highgarden and steal my boy.

16:45.088 --> 16:46.924
My last boy.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.594
Margaery will dig her claws in,
you will dig your claws in,

16:50.677 --> 16:54.223
and you'll fight over him like beasts
until you rip him apart.

16:54.306 --> 16:58.352
I will burn our house to the ground
before I let that happen.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.354
And how will you do that?

17:02.272 --> 17:03.857
I'll tell everyone the truth.

17:03.941 --> 17:06.276
What truth would that be?

17:10.948 --> 17:12.156
You don't know, do you?

17:14.660 --> 17:17.037
You never believed it.

17:17.746 --> 17:18.789
How is that possible?

17:21.750 --> 17:24.377
What am I saying? Of course it's possible.

17:24.461 --> 17:27.839
How can someone so consumed
by the idea of his family

17:27.923 --> 17:31.134
have any conception
what his actual family was doing?

17:32.386 --> 17:35.222
We were right there in front of you,
and you didn't see us.

17:35.305 --> 17:37.558
One real look in the past 20 years

17:37.641 --> 17:40.310
at your own children
and you would have known.

17:41.395 --> 17:42.896
Known what?

17:43.856 --> 17:45.357
Everything they say is true

17:45.440 --> 17:46.984
- about Jaime and me.
- No.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.819
- Your legacy is a lie.
- No, no, no, no.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.905
I don't believe you.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.536
Yes, you do.

18:15.345 --> 18:16.430
Jaime.

18:18.557 --> 18:20.017
You won.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.769
One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself.

18:22.853 --> 18:25.105
There's really nothing
you wouldn't do, is there?

18:25.189 --> 18:27.024
For my family, no, nothing.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.151
I would do things for my family
you couldn't imagine.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.820
- Tyrion is your family.
- He's not.

18:31.904 --> 18:34.823
- You don't get to choose.
- I do. So do you.

18:34.990 --> 18:37.910
You can choose the creature that
killed our mother to come into this world...

18:37.993 --> 18:40.454
Are you really mad enough
to blame him for that?

18:40.579 --> 18:43.165
He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.

18:43.248 --> 18:45.083
A disease doesn't decide to kill you.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.836
All the same, you cut it out before it does.

18:48.253 --> 18:49.796
What do you decide?

18:50.297 --> 18:52.466
- What do you choose?
- The things I did to get back to you,

18:52.549 --> 18:55.052
to endure all that, only to find you...

18:58.555 --> 19:00.140
I choose you.

19:00.224 --> 19:02.100
- Those are words.
- Yes.

19:02.476 --> 19:04.144
Like the ones I just said to Father.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.189
I told him.

19:07.898 --> 19:08.982
Told him what?

19:09.066 --> 19:10.817
I told him about us.

19:12.569 --> 19:15.989
- You told him?
- I told him I won't marry Loras Tyrell.

19:16.073 --> 19:19.618
I told him I'm staying right here
with Tommen, with you.

19:19.701 --> 19:22.496
- You think he'll just accept that?
- Go and ask him.

19:25.916 --> 19:26.959
What did you say?

19:27.042 --> 19:29.294
I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister.

19:29.837 --> 19:31.964
I don't choose Tywin Lannister.

19:32.047 --> 19:36.218
I don't love Tywin Lannister.
I love my brother.

19:36.301 --> 19:37.678
I love my lover.

19:39.054 --> 19:42.724
People will whisper, they'll make their jokes.
Let them.

19:42.808 --> 19:45.769
They're all so small, I can't even see them.

19:45.853 --> 19:48.021
I only see what matters.

19:56.905 --> 19:59.700
- Someone will walk in.
- I don't care.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.253
You stand before Daenerys Stormborn,

20:11.545 --> 20:12.546
the Unburnt,

20:12.838 --> 20:13.964
Queen of Meereen,

20:14.631 --> 20:17.968
Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar
and the First Men.

20:18.802 --> 20:21.305
Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,

20:21.763 --> 20:24.641
Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.

20:25.851 --> 20:31.648
Thank you for seeing me, Your Grace.

20:31.732 --> 20:34.693
My name is Fennesz.

20:36.111 --> 20:39.239
I can speak the Common Tongue, if you wish.

20:39.323 --> 20:41.074
You speak it very well.

20:41.158 --> 20:44.953
Before you freed me,
I belonged to Master Mighdal.

20:45.037 --> 20:49.208
I was tutor to his children.
I taught them languages and history.

20:49.833 --> 20:53.253
They know a great deal about your family
because of me.

20:53.837 --> 20:58.759
Little Calla is only seven,
but she admires you very much.

20:58.842 --> 21:01.720
I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration.

21:02.262 --> 21:03.722
What can I do for you?

21:05.140 --> 21:09.686
When you took the city, the children
begged me not to leave the house.

21:10.687 --> 21:13.899
But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.777
So I lost my home.

21:18.904 --> 21:20.781
Now I live on the streets.

21:20.864 --> 21:22.574
I have outfitted mess halls

21:22.658 --> 21:25.035
to feed all former slaves
and barracks to shelter them.

21:25.118 --> 21:27.412
I do not mean to offend, Your Grace.

21:27.704 --> 21:30.332
I went to one of these places.

21:30.415 --> 21:33.293
The young prey on the old,

21:33.377 --> 21:35.963
take what they want and beat us if we resist.

21:36.046 --> 21:39.341
My Unsullied will make them safe again
in short order, my friend,

21:39.424 --> 21:40.634
this I promise you.

21:40.717 --> 21:44.513
Even if they are safe, who would I be there?

21:44.930 --> 21:47.349
What purpose would I serve?

21:47.766 --> 21:50.811
With my master, I was a teacher.

21:50.894 --> 21:54.523
I had the respect and love of his children.

21:54.606 --> 21:56.650
What is it that you want from me?

21:56.733 --> 21:58.402
Your Grace,

21:58.944 --> 22:02.656
I ask you to let me sell myself
back to Master Mighdal.

22:02.739 --> 22:05.325
You want to return to a man who owned you

22:05.409 --> 22:07.744
like a goat or a chair?

22:07.828 --> 22:09.371
Please, Your Grace.

22:09.454 --> 22:12.666
The young may rejoice in the new world
you have built for them,

22:12.749 --> 22:15.711
but for those of us too old to change,

22:15.794 --> 22:19.840
there is only fear and squalor.

22:20.424 --> 22:22.134
I am not alone.

22:22.926 --> 22:26.054
There are many outside
waiting to beg the same of you.

22:26.138 --> 22:30.851
I did not take this city to preside over
the injustice I fought to destroy.

22:30.934 --> 22:33.604
I took it to bring people freedom.

22:34.813 --> 22:37.316
But freedom means making your own choices.

22:38.609 --> 22:41.820
I will allow you to sign a contract
with your former master.

22:41.945 --> 22:45.282
It may not cover a period
lasting longer than a year.

22:45.491 --> 22:47.409
Thank you, Your Grace.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.121
Thank you.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.962
The masters will take advantage
of this situation.

23:00.422 --> 23:05.135
The men serving them
will be slaves in all but name.

23:11.975 --> 23:13.268
Approach, my friend.

23:19.983 --> 23:21.151
I do not understand, my Queen.

23:23.987 --> 23:25.489
I do not understand, my Queen.

23:25.906 --> 23:27.741
The Queen says you may approach.

23:38.210 --> 23:40.087
I have brought you...

23:44.716 --> 23:46.176
He came from the sky.

23:48.262 --> 23:50.430
The black one.

23:54.518 --> 23:55.811
The winged shadow.

23:57.563 --> 23:58.981
He came from the sky and...

24:05.112 --> 24:06.613
My girl.

24:07.781 --> 24:08.907
My little girl.

24:14.163 --> 24:15.372
What was her name?

24:15.747 --> 24:17.291
Zala, Your Grace.

24:17.374 --> 24:20.502
- How old was she?
- Three.

24:21.712 --> 24:23.589
Three.

24:25.090 --> 24:27.718
And still no word of Drogon?

24:29.636 --> 24:34.141
Sailors saw him flying over the Black Cliffs
three days ago, my Queen.

24:35.184 --> 24:36.560
Nothing since then.

24:39.688 --> 24:42.024
Meet me at the catacombs.

27:11.215 --> 27:15.511
They came to us
from White Harbour and Barrowton,

27:15.594 --> 27:19.640
from Fairmarket and King's Landing,

27:19.723 --> 27:21.642
from north and south,

27:21.725 --> 27:23.852
from east and west.

27:25.062 --> 27:26.855
They died

27:26.939 --> 27:31.735
protecting men, women, and children
who will never know their names.

27:31.860 --> 27:34.488
It is for us to remember them.

27:34.571 --> 27:36.281
Our brothers,

27:36.365 --> 27:39.368
we shall never see their like again.

27:39.451 --> 27:42.496
And now their watch is ended.

27:42.579 --> 27:47.042
And now their watch is ended.

28:58.655 --> 29:01.366
Your old blind man patched me up.

29:01.867 --> 29:02.868
Why?

29:02.951 --> 29:06.246
He's sworn to treat all wounded men,
friend or foe.

29:06.330 --> 29:08.499
You want me alive so you can torture me?

29:08.582 --> 29:09.875
No one's gonna torture you.

29:09.958 --> 29:13.795
So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading?

29:14.213 --> 29:15.756
Drop us from the top of the Wall?

29:15.839 --> 29:17.841
I don't know what happens to the prisoners.

29:18.342 --> 29:19.760
Who decides?

29:20.260 --> 29:22.387
I suppose Stannis does.

29:23.096 --> 29:24.681
He your king now?

29:25.140 --> 29:26.975
I don't have a king.

29:28.310 --> 29:31.980
You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow.

29:32.773 --> 29:34.691
You can never be a kneeler again.

29:35.567 --> 29:38.028
We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead.

29:39.655 --> 29:43.909
- Do you want to say any words over them?
- Words? What kind of words?

29:43.992 --> 29:47.120
Funeral words.
I don't know how the free folk do it.

29:47.204 --> 29:48.372
Do what?

29:49.206 --> 29:50.582
Say farewell.

29:51.834 --> 29:54.545
The dead can't hear us, boy.

29:59.591 --> 30:00.592
Snow.

30:05.430 --> 30:06.765
Did you love her?

30:10.060 --> 30:11.854
She loved you.

30:12.855 --> 30:15.399
- She told you?
- No.

30:15.774 --> 30:18.569
All she ever talked about was killing you.

30:18.944 --> 30:20.737
That's how I know.

30:23.574 --> 30:25.784
She belongs in the North.

30:26.910 --> 30:28.662
The real North.

30:30.414 --> 30:32.082
You understand me?

32:17.980 --> 32:19.439
We can stop. We can rest.

32:19.523 --> 32:21.692
We'll rest with the three-eyed raven.

32:32.536 --> 32:34.496
We're not going to make it.

32:38.917 --> 32:40.377
We're already here.

32:40.460 --> 32:41.670
Jojen.

32:43.547 --> 32:44.882
Jojen.

32:45.507 --> 32:47.509
Look, Jojen.

34:09.049 --> 34:11.426
Jojen! Come on!

34:11.552 --> 34:13.762
Help them! Now!

34:14.137 --> 34:15.264
Hold on to me!

34:19.893 --> 34:20.978
Hang on!

34:23.230 --> 34:25.649
- Hodor. Hodor.
- Help them!

34:26.065 --> 34:27.234
Hodor.

34:30.612 --> 34:31.864
Hodor!

34:48.130 --> 34:49.715
Hodor!

35:09.359 --> 35:10.444
Hodor.

35:13.322 --> 35:14.448
Hodor!

35:45.604 --> 35:46.855
Bran!

35:51.276 --> 35:52.820
Save yourself, now!

36:18.345 --> 36:20.264
Come with me, Brandon Stark.

36:27.688 --> 36:28.689
He is lost.

36:30.065 --> 36:31.984
Come with me or die with him.

36:33.068 --> 36:34.444
Go with them.

37:38.050 --> 37:39.760
They cannot follow us.

37:39.843 --> 37:42.054
The power that moves them is powerless here.

37:43.597 --> 37:45.057
Who are you?

37:45.140 --> 37:49.728
The First Men called us the Children,
but we were born long before them.

37:50.103 --> 37:52.523
Come, he waits for you.

39:17.149 --> 39:19.401
You're the three-eyed raven?

39:23.447 --> 39:25.699
I've been many things.

39:26.158 --> 39:29.286
Now I am what you see.

39:31.205 --> 39:34.583
My brother, he led us to you and now he...

39:34.666 --> 39:36.960
He knew what would happen.

39:37.211 --> 39:39.505
From the moment he left,

39:39.630 --> 39:42.716
he knew and he went anyway.

39:42.799 --> 39:44.009
How do you know?

39:44.092 --> 39:45.969
I've been watching you.

39:46.595 --> 39:47.971
All of you.

39:48.430 --> 39:50.182
All of your lives.

39:50.807 --> 39:52.976
With 1,000 eyes and one.

39:55.437 --> 39:57.689
Now you've come to me at last,

39:57.773 --> 39:59.816
Brandon Stark.

40:00.984 --> 40:02.945
Though the hour is late.

40:03.821 --> 40:05.906
I didn't want anyone to die for me.

40:05.989 --> 40:09.326
He died so you could find what you have lost.

40:10.911 --> 40:13.497
You're going to help me walk again?

40:14.540 --> 40:17.084
You will never walk again.

40:19.294 --> 40:21.338
But you will fly.

40:37.354 --> 40:39.022
Podrick.

40:39.940 --> 40:41.859
Podrick.

40:41.942 --> 40:43.360
Where are the horses?

40:44.862 --> 40:46.780
I hobbled them last night.

40:46.864 --> 40:48.365
What sort of hobble?

40:48.448 --> 40:50.033
A figure eight, like you taught me.

40:51.201 --> 40:53.620
If you did it like I taught you,
then the horses would be here.

40:53.704 --> 40:54.705
Thieves, maybe?

40:55.497 --> 40:58.375
It's at least 30 miles to the Eyrie from here.

40:58.709 --> 41:00.252
You're carrying the saddlebags.

41:28.655 --> 41:29.656
People coming.

41:32.075 --> 41:34.786
You can shit later. There's people coming.

41:37.164 --> 41:38.165
Morning.

41:40.459 --> 41:41.835
Morning.

41:43.420 --> 41:44.421
I like your sword.

41:46.256 --> 41:48.550
Are we getting close to the Bloody Gate?

41:49.426 --> 41:50.552
About 10 more miles.

41:50.928 --> 41:52.721
Did you hear that, Podrick?

41:52.804 --> 41:54.765
Only 10 more miles to the Bloody Gate.

41:57.100 --> 41:58.268
Are you a knight?

41:59.102 --> 42:00.270
No.

42:00.771 --> 42:02.481
But you know how to use that sword?

42:03.106 --> 42:04.608
I do.

42:05.943 --> 42:07.319
Does it have a name?

42:08.070 --> 42:09.655
Oathkeeper.

42:09.738 --> 42:11.114
Mine's Needle.

42:11.949 --> 42:13.367
Good name.

42:15.744 --> 42:17.371
Who taught you how to fight?

42:18.747 --> 42:20.082
My father.

42:22.084 --> 42:24.086
Mine never wanted to.

42:25.087 --> 42:27.381
Said fighting was for boys.

42:27.464 --> 42:29.466
Mine said the same.

42:29.967 --> 42:31.635
But I kept fighting the boys anyway.

42:32.553 --> 42:33.929
Kept losing.

42:34.012 --> 42:35.430
Finally my father said,

42:35.514 --> 42:38.100
"If you're going to do it,
you might as well do it right."

42:42.563 --> 42:44.064
Seven blessings.

42:44.147 --> 42:46.483
I'm Brienne of Tarth. This is Podrick Payne.

42:49.361 --> 42:50.737
You want something?

42:51.280 --> 42:54.241
That's Sandor Clegane. The Hound.

43:05.419 --> 43:07.171
You're Arya Stark.

43:07.671 --> 43:10.215
I asked if you wanted something.

43:10.299 --> 43:12.885
I swore to your mother
I would bring you home to her.

43:14.386 --> 43:17.055
- My mother's dead.
- I know.

43:17.973 --> 43:20.142
I wish I could have been there to protect her.

43:21.643 --> 43:23.020
You're not a Northerner.

43:23.103 --> 43:26.356
No, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her.

43:27.483 --> 43:28.734
Why didn't you?

43:32.863 --> 43:35.616
She commanded me to bring
Jaime Lannister back to King's Landing.

43:35.699 --> 43:37.451
You're paid by the Lannisters.

43:38.410 --> 43:40.037
You're here for the bounty on me.

43:41.371 --> 43:42.789
I'm not paid by the Lannisters.

43:42.873 --> 43:43.957
No?

43:46.335 --> 43:49.505
Fancy sword you've got there.
Where'd you get it?

43:52.508 --> 43:54.885
I've been looking at Lannister gold all my life.

43:56.803 --> 43:59.598
Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth.

43:59.681 --> 44:01.725
Tell me that's not Lannister gold.

44:03.018 --> 44:05.896
Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.

44:06.396 --> 44:07.773
The Bloody Gate is 10 miles.

44:07.856 --> 44:09.608
I swore to your mother
by the old gods and the new.

44:09.691 --> 44:11.068
I don't care what you swore.

44:11.151 --> 44:12.653
- Arya!
- You heard the girl.

44:12.820 --> 44:15.489
- She's not coming with you.
- She is.

44:17.783 --> 44:19.076
You're not a good listener.

44:19.743 --> 44:20.911
Valyrian steel?

44:22.079 --> 44:23.831
I always wanted some Valyrian steel.

44:23.914 --> 44:26.667
Come with me, Arya. I'll take you to safety.

44:26.750 --> 44:29.461
Safety? Where the fuck's that?

44:29.545 --> 44:30.712
Her aunt in the Eyrie is dead.

44:30.796 --> 44:33.715
Her mother's dead. Her father's dead.
Her brother's dead.

44:33.799 --> 44:36.093
Winterfell is a pile of rubble.

44:36.176 --> 44:38.303
There is no safety, you dumb bitch.

44:39.763 --> 44:43.934
You don't know that by now,
you're the wrong one to watch over her.

44:44.017 --> 44:46.353
And that's what you're doing?

44:46.436 --> 44:47.813
Watching over her?

44:49.106 --> 44:50.941
Aye, that's what I'm doing.

45:59.176 --> 46:01.053
I have no wish to kill you, Ser.

46:14.525 --> 46:15.609
I'm not a knight.

47:33.812 --> 47:37.733
Arya!

47:38.942 --> 47:40.777
Arya!

47:42.112 --> 47:44.490
- Where is she?
- She was just here.

47:44.573 --> 47:45.657
Why weren't you watching her?

47:45.741 --> 47:47.659
I was watching you.
I thought you might need some help.

47:47.743 --> 47:49.870
Which way, Pod? Which way did she go?

47:49.953 --> 47:51.872
I think that way.

47:51.955 --> 47:55.918
Arya!

48:24.655 --> 48:26.657
You still here?

48:36.792 --> 48:38.460
Big bitch saved you.

48:39.545 --> 48:40.963
I don't need saving.

48:41.046 --> 48:43.423
No, not you. You're a real killer.

48:43.549 --> 48:45.926
With your water dancing

48:46.009 --> 48:47.886
and your Needle.

48:49.096 --> 48:50.973
You gonna die?

48:51.056 --> 48:53.559
Unless there's a maester
hiding behind that rock,

48:54.726 --> 48:56.019
aye,

48:56.895 --> 48:58.564
I'm done.

49:02.234 --> 49:03.902
I'd skin you alive for wine.

49:06.113 --> 49:07.990
Fuck water.

49:09.825 --> 49:11.994
Killed by a woman.

49:13.704 --> 49:14.830
I bet you like that.

49:17.749 --> 49:19.376
Go on,

49:19.877 --> 49:21.461
go after her.

49:22.504 --> 49:24.006
She'll help you.

49:27.634 --> 49:29.261
Going it alone,

49:29.845 --> 49:32.222
you won't last a day out there.

49:32.890 --> 49:35.392
I'll last longer than you.

49:41.857 --> 49:44.401
You remember where the heart is?

49:51.867 --> 49:54.703
Fuck it. I'm ready.

49:57.498 --> 49:58.749
Go on, girl.

49:59.750 --> 50:02.127
Another name off your list.

50:02.878 --> 50:05.088
You kept promising me.

50:11.929 --> 50:16.058
I cut down your butcher's boy. The ginger.

50:17.684 --> 50:19.853
He was begging for mercy.

50:19.937 --> 50:22.940
"Please, Ser. Please don't kill me.

50:23.023 --> 50:24.983
Please, please."

50:26.777 --> 50:29.488
Bled all over my horse.

50:29.571 --> 50:31.949
Saddle stunk of butcher's boy for weeks.

50:35.160 --> 50:36.954
And your sister.

50:37.955 --> 50:39.748
Your pretty sister.

50:41.083 --> 50:43.669
I should have taken her.

50:44.378 --> 50:47.089
That night the Blackwater burned.

50:48.465 --> 50:50.133
I should have fucked her bloody.

50:51.760 --> 50:54.388
At least I'd have one happy memory.

51:04.731 --> 51:06.817
Do I have to beg you?

51:11.488 --> 51:13.073
Do it.

51:18.162 --> 51:19.913
Do it.

51:23.167 --> 51:24.710
Do it.

51:54.740 --> 51:56.867
Kill me.

52:00.078 --> 52:01.121
Kill me!

52:04.208 --> 52:06.418
Kill me!

52:07.878 --> 52:08.879
Kill me!

52:19.556 --> 52:21.892
Oh, get on with it, you son of a whore.

52:22.392 --> 52:24.061
Is that any way to speak about our mother?

52:25.395 --> 52:27.731
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

52:27.815 --> 52:29.691
A galley's waiting in the bay
bound for the Free Cities.

52:29.775 --> 52:31.235
- Who's helping you?
- Varys.

52:31.318 --> 52:33.570
- Varys?
- You have more friends than you thought.

52:45.249 --> 52:46.834
There's a locked door at the top of the stairs.

52:47.167 --> 52:49.253
Knock on it twice, then twice again.

52:50.546 --> 52:52.047
Varys will open.

52:52.840 --> 52:55.050
I suppose this is goodbye, then.

53:10.774 --> 53:12.776
Farewell, little brother.

53:14.153 --> 53:15.654
Jaime.

53:17.322 --> 53:20.284
Thank you. For my life.

53:23.328 --> 53:25.205
Quickly now.

54:44.368 --> 54:45.911
Tywin?

54:49.081 --> 54:50.123
My lion.

56:09.953 --> 56:11.330
I'm sorry.

56:24.635 --> 56:26.345
I'm sorry.

57:13.433 --> 57:15.269
Tyrion.

57:16.687 --> 57:17.855
Put down the crossbow.

57:22.109 --> 57:23.694
Who released you?

57:25.571 --> 57:28.532
Your brother, I expect.
He always had a soft spot for you.

57:29.867 --> 57:32.369
Come, we'll go and talk in my chambers.

57:37.040 --> 57:40.002
This is how you want to speak to me, hmm?

57:40.085 --> 57:42.379
Shaming your father has
always given you pleasure...

57:42.462 --> 57:44.298
All my life

57:44.381 --> 57:46.550
you've wanted me dead.

57:49.428 --> 57:50.512
Yes.

57:51.346 --> 57:53.182
But you refused to die.

57:53.265 --> 57:54.725
I respect that.

57:55.559 --> 57:56.643
Even admire it.

57:56.935 --> 57:59.021
You fight for what's yours.

57:59.688 --> 58:02.733
I'd never let them execute you.
Is that what you fear?

58:03.233 --> 58:05.652
I'll never let Ilyn Payne take your head.

58:05.736 --> 58:07.779
You're a Lannister.

58:10.115 --> 58:12.075
You're my son.

58:14.578 --> 58:15.829
I loved her.

58:16.622 --> 58:17.873
Who?

58:18.874 --> 58:20.292
Shae.

58:21.001 --> 58:22.419
Oh, Tyrion.

58:23.754 --> 58:24.713
Put down that crossbow.

58:24.796 --> 58:26.048
I murdered her.

58:28.592 --> 58:30.219
With my own hands.

58:33.597 --> 58:34.598
It doesn't matter.

58:35.015 --> 58:36.767
Doesn't matter?

58:37.142 --> 58:38.185
She was a whore.

58:40.854 --> 58:42.856
- Say that word again...
- And what?

58:42.940 --> 58:45.359
You'll kill your own father in the privy?

58:46.860 --> 58:48.028
No.

58:48.946 --> 58:50.072
You're my son.

58:50.989 --> 58:52.533
Now, enough of this nonsense.

58:52.616 --> 58:55.911
I am your son, and you sentenced me to die.

58:56.286 --> 58:59.790
You knew I didn't poison Joffrey,

58:59.873 --> 59:02.626
but you sentenced me all the same.

59:03.168 --> 59:05.170
- Why?
- Enough.

59:05.504 --> 59:08.257
We'll go back to my chambers
and speak with some dignity.

59:08.340 --> 59:11.009
I can't go back there. She's in there.

59:11.093 --> 59:12.135
You're afraid of a dead whore?

59:25.482 --> 59:26.859
You shot me.

59:36.326 --> 59:38.203
You're no son of mine.

59:38.287 --> 59:39.538
I am your son.

59:41.498 --> 59:43.667
I have always been your son.

59:58.599 --> 01:00:00.476
What have you done?

01:00:01.894 --> 01:00:03.645
Quickly.

01:00:07.024 --> 01:00:10.068
Trust me, my friend. I've brought you this far.

01:02:05.058 --> 01:02:06.685
I want to see the captain.

01:02:06.768 --> 01:02:08.479
You're seeing him.

01:02:08.562 --> 01:02:10.689
I want to go north, to the Wall.

01:02:11.648 --> 01:02:13.150
No, you don't.

01:02:14.067 --> 01:02:15.402
I can pay.

01:02:15.486 --> 01:02:18.572
There is nothing in the North
but ice and war and pirates.

01:02:18.655 --> 01:02:21.825
I wouldn't need a cabin. Please.

01:02:21.909 --> 01:02:23.577
I could work scrubbing the floors...

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.413
I'm not going north, child. I'm going home.

01:02:26.497 --> 01:02:29.374
- Where's home?
- The Free City of Braavos.

01:02:30.667 --> 01:02:32.252
Wait. I have something else.

01:02:32.336 --> 01:02:35.923
- More silver won't make a difference.
- It's not silver.

01:02:36.006 --> 01:02:37.174
It's iron.

01:02:40.052 --> 01:02:41.428
This...

01:02:45.682 --> 01:02:48.185
- How did you...
- Valar Morghulis.

01:02:50.771 --> 01:02:52.648
Valar Dohaeris.

01:02:52.731 --> 01:02:55.442
Of course, you shall have a cabin.
