00:24.399 --> 00:26.632
Laura seemed
a bit upset last night.

00:26.634 --> 00:28.636
Oh, why is that?

00:30.139 --> 00:32.371
I think it may be my fault.

00:32.372 --> 00:34.607
What's your fault?

00:34.609 --> 00:37.277
Well, just trying to
help her get out a bit.

00:37.279 --> 00:39.279
She's not your daughter.

00:39.281 --> 00:40.948
I know, but if
we did have a daughter,

00:40.950 --> 00:43.049
she'd be about her age.

00:43.051 --> 00:44.350
You're not her mother.

00:44.352 --> 00:46.688
I have maternal instincts.

00:48.891 --> 00:50.857
Well, she doesn't get out.

00:50.859 --> 00:51.924
I just thought it might be nice

00:51.926 --> 00:53.893
if someone asked her for a date.

00:53.895 --> 00:58.198
What did you do?

00:58.200 --> 01:02.435
Well, do you remember
that young man, Alex?

01:02.437 --> 01:05.038
Alex, he's a
self absorbed bar...

01:05.040 --> 01:06.907
It was only supposed
to be company,

01:06.909 --> 01:08.175
not an engagement.

01:08.177 --> 01:09.011
Okay.

01:12.847 --> 01:16.583
Well she said everything
was going great.

01:16.585 --> 01:19.353
They laughed, they talked.

01:19.355 --> 01:21.154
Had a lot in common.

01:21.156 --> 01:23.923
It sounds like
everything went well.

01:23.925 --> 01:26.926
Until he excused himself
to go to the restroom.

01:26.928 --> 01:27.763
Oh.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.530
He never came back.

01:30.532 --> 01:32.431
She was completely humiliated.

01:32.433 --> 01:34.535
Well don't
blame yourself.

01:34.537 --> 01:35.371
You tried.

01:37.138 --> 01:39.405
He could have at least
ended the date politely.

01:39.407 --> 01:41.708
She really had
her feelings hurt.

01:41.710 --> 01:43.509
There are plenty of
other men out there.

01:43.511 --> 01:44.744
She'll find someone.

01:44.746 --> 01:47.983
She won't if she
doesn't get out more.

01:50.618 --> 01:53.121
I just want you to get better.

01:56.659 --> 01:57.493
Tom.

02:00.462 --> 02:01.296
Tom?

02:11.006 --> 02:13.609
Laura, I don't know what to do.

02:14.943 --> 02:19.345
Tom's breathing has
suddenly gotten much worse.

02:19.347 --> 02:20.480
Tom?

02:20.482 --> 02:21.314
He's not breathing!

02:24.987 --> 02:25.821
Tom?

02:48.010 --> 02:49.310
She's doing CPR.

02:50.613 --> 02:51.979
Oh God.

02:51.981 --> 02:53.082
Please hurry.

02:56.150 --> 02:58.218
Mrs. Minnett!

02:58.220 --> 02:59.185
It's okay.

02:59.187 --> 03:01.222
He's awake, I have to go.

03:03.325 --> 03:04.457
Tom.

03:04.459 --> 03:06.561
What, what's happening?

03:08.596 --> 03:10.863
You're gonna be fine.

03:10.865 --> 03:12.165
Hold on, okay?

03:12.167 --> 03:13.533
I will, I will.

03:13.535 --> 03:15.768
Everything's gonna be okay.

03:15.770 --> 03:17.737
I know, I know.

03:17.739 --> 03:21.076
We just have to get
you to the hospital.

03:22.344 --> 03:23.944
I love you.

03:23.946 --> 03:25.611
I love you too.

03:35.724 --> 03:36.558
Tom?

03:37.458 --> 03:38.293
Tom.

03:41.297 --> 03:42.131
Please.

03:44.266 --> 03:45.100
Please.

03:47.001 --> 03:47.835
Please.

03:50.138 --> 03:51.671
Tom.

03:51.673 --> 03:52.507
Tom.

03:53.941 --> 03:55.342
Tom.

03:55.344 --> 03:56.178
Don't go.

03:59.748 --> 04:00.548
No.

04:01.649 --> 04:03.249
No.

04:03.251 --> 04:04.085
No, no!

04:05.587 --> 04:06.422
No!

05:42.683 --> 05:44.049
Is this what
you were looking for?

05:44.051 --> 05:46.019
Yes, that's perfect.

05:46.021 --> 05:50.457
So, what's the big news
that requires polished silver?

05:50.459 --> 05:51.657
I put a lot of
thought into it,

05:51.659 --> 05:52.926
and I think I'm going to start

05:52.928 --> 05:55.128
renting out the cottage again.

05:55.130 --> 05:57.029
I have young couple
coming today.

05:57.031 --> 05:58.097
Really?

05:58.099 --> 05:59.733
What changed your mind?

05:59.735 --> 06:01.835
I need to start doing
something with myself.

06:01.837 --> 06:04.270
Besides, Tom would want me to.

06:04.272 --> 06:07.106
This cottage wants to
be enjoyed by newlyweds.

06:07.108 --> 06:09.476
I think that sounds romantic.

06:09.478 --> 06:13.113
I know it sounds silly, but
when I was a little girl

06:13.115 --> 06:16.048
I used to imagine having
my honeymoon here.

06:16.050 --> 06:20.221
Don't worry, you just
need to give it some time.

06:23.192 --> 06:24.423
You haven't been
by in over a week.

06:24.425 --> 06:25.959
Is everything alright?

06:25.961 --> 06:28.128
Yeah, I've just been picking
up some extra shifts at work.

06:28.130 --> 06:30.130
And I feel like I live
there most of the time.

06:30.132 --> 06:32.666
But it sure
beats sitting around

06:32.668 --> 06:34.670
alone at home every day.

06:35.803 --> 06:36.837
What about your friends?

06:36.839 --> 06:38.171
You spend time with them, right?

06:38.173 --> 06:39.806
Well not really.

06:39.808 --> 06:43.008
Everyone has a family,
they're too busy.

06:43.010 --> 06:45.811
Are you seeing anyone?

06:45.813 --> 06:47.647
No.

06:47.649 --> 06:50.183
No, every man I meet
is either crazy,

06:50.185 --> 06:54.553
just looking to get laid
or not interested in me.

06:54.555 --> 06:57.556
Well it's not as hopeless
as you're making it sound.

06:57.558 --> 06:59.193
You'll meet someone.

07:00.995 --> 07:02.930
Well how's that look?

07:05.334 --> 07:06.399
Like new.

07:06.401 --> 07:08.668
So who's coming by today?

07:08.670 --> 07:10.070
I met the groom to be.

07:10.072 --> 07:12.005
He's in the military.

07:12.007 --> 07:13.806
The marines I think.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.808
Good looking guy.

07:17.613 --> 07:19.012
Oh no.

07:19.014 --> 07:20.046
It's them.

07:20.048 --> 07:21.181
They're here early.

07:21.183 --> 07:22.015
Can you open the door?

07:22.017 --> 07:22.849
And I'll put this away.

07:22.851 --> 07:24.185
Uh yeah, sure.

07:28.923 --> 07:31.758
Hi, is Mrs. Minnett here?

07:31.760 --> 07:32.594
Yeah.

07:33.861 --> 07:36.128
She should be here in a second.

07:36.130 --> 07:37.630
Can I get guys anything?

07:37.632 --> 07:38.664
No, no thank you.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.267
We're fine.

07:40.269 --> 07:41.668
I heard you guys are
renting the cottage

07:41.670 --> 07:42.902
for your honeymoon.

07:42.904 --> 07:44.404
Oh, we actually
haven't decided yet.

07:44.406 --> 07:45.972
Which is lucky,
because otherwise

07:45.974 --> 07:48.508
I wouldn't have
found this place.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.310
What he's not telling you
is that our other option

07:50.312 --> 07:53.113
is an eight week
honeymoon trip to Europe.

07:53.115 --> 07:54.580
But to hear Oliver
talk about it,

07:54.582 --> 07:56.815
it's as if he's being sent
to the electric chair.

07:56.817 --> 07:58.484
The electric chair?

07:58.486 --> 08:00.921
Here I thought marriage
was just a life sentence.

08:02.390 --> 08:03.724
Oliver Bradshaw.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.794
Oh, this is Susan.

08:07.796 --> 08:08.628
Hello.

08:08.630 --> 08:09.895
I'm Laura.

08:09.897 --> 08:11.830
Laura Pennington,
I'm the neighbor.

08:11.832 --> 08:13.866
Just grew up next door.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.036
We're friends.

08:16.337 --> 08:17.570
I'm just helping out today.

08:17.572 --> 08:21.373
You know so, she should
be here any second.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.275
I love this place.

08:23.277 --> 08:24.743
I can't believe it exists.

08:24.745 --> 08:28.248
I mean it looks like stepping
back in time or something.

08:28.250 --> 08:29.481
Oliver.

08:29.483 --> 08:30.416
Oh.

08:30.418 --> 08:31.217
It's good to see you again.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.385
This must be Susan.

08:32.386 --> 08:33.217
Um hmm.

08:33.220 --> 08:34.721
A pleasure.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.087
Oliver has had nothing but
nice things to say about you.

08:36.090 --> 08:37.524
See honey?

08:37.525 --> 08:40.592
I told you, I never say anything
but nice things about you.

08:40.595 --> 08:42.361
Did he tell you
about our home,

08:42.363 --> 08:43.328
how he found us?

08:43.331 --> 08:45.432
One of his road trips I think.

08:45.434 --> 08:46.732
I happened to be
driving by one day

08:46.734 --> 08:48.000
and it caught my attention

08:48.002 --> 08:50.502
and just had to stop by
and take a look around.

08:50.504 --> 08:52.972
Well let me tell you
a little about my home.

08:52.974 --> 08:55.241
The cottage was
originally built in London

08:55.243 --> 08:58.477
in the early 1800s
as a vacation home

08:58.479 --> 09:00.347
for a young Lord and his wife.

09:00.349 --> 09:01.948
The wife felt so at peace here

09:01.950 --> 09:04.818
that they decided to move
it to the United States

09:04.820 --> 09:06.686
and live in as their
primary residence.

09:06.688 --> 09:07.886
How'd they do that?

09:07.888 --> 09:09.688
Actually it was taken
in sections by ship

09:09.690 --> 09:11.223
and reassembled
when it got here.

09:11.225 --> 09:12.759
They brought it
here in sections?

09:12.761 --> 09:14.159
It gets even better.

09:14.161 --> 09:15.962
There's a tradition of
having honeymooners stay here

09:15.964 --> 09:17.697
that started with
the first owner

09:17.699 --> 09:20.368
and has continued for 150 years.

09:21.536 --> 09:23.837
My husband and I spent
our honeymoon here.

09:23.839 --> 09:27.539
Mrs. Minnett, would you
mind showing Susan around

09:27.541 --> 09:30.110
and working her magic on
her like you did on me?

09:30.112 --> 09:32.111
I'm not quite sure
she's as enthusiastic

09:32.113 --> 09:33.612
about your home as I am.

09:33.614 --> 09:36.048
No Oliver, this
place is charming.

09:36.050 --> 09:38.284
I'd be delighted to
stay here sometime.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.086
And I'm certain that
for some couples,

09:40.088 --> 09:42.121
this is the perfect
honeymoon retreat.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.457
I'm just not sure
it's right for us.

09:44.459 --> 09:46.959
You're gonna have your work
cut out for you Mrs. Minnett.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.428
I think your
decision will be easy

09:48.430 --> 09:50.362
after I show you around.

09:50.364 --> 09:53.466
The cottage never lets
true love walk away.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.135
Go on Susan, I've
already taken the tour.

09:55.137 --> 09:58.004
And honey, give it a chance.

09:58.006 --> 10:00.140
I'll do my best.

10:00.142 --> 10:03.478
I'll
show you upstairs.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.548
You're gonna make a
very handsome groom.

10:09.550 --> 10:10.784
Thank you.

10:10.786 --> 10:12.419
I didn't mean that
in a flirty way though.

10:12.421 --> 10:13.886
I didn't think you did.

10:13.888 --> 10:15.154
I just never say the
things that are on my mind

10:15.156 --> 10:16.622
and I'm trying to
break that habit,

10:16.624 --> 10:19.458
'cause otherwise my friends
say I'll never get a boyfriend.

10:19.460 --> 10:21.394
Not that I'm implying that was
thinking of you in that way.

10:21.396 --> 10:22.795
Because I wasn't.

10:22.797 --> 10:24.731
Not that you're not
attractive, because you are.

10:24.733 --> 10:27.766
I mean you're like gorgeous.

10:27.768 --> 10:28.934
I'm shutting up now.

10:28.936 --> 10:30.272
No, it's okay.

10:32.940 --> 10:34.841
So how'd the two of you meet?

10:34.843 --> 10:38.510
Our families have been
friends since before I was born.

10:38.512 --> 10:40.612
So we kind of grew up together.

10:40.614 --> 10:41.981
Childhood sweethearts.

10:41.983 --> 10:42.816
No.

10:42.818 --> 10:44.317
We got close in college.

10:44.319 --> 10:47.153
Everyone said were
meant to be together.

10:47.155 --> 10:48.688
Oh that's lovely.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.356
Most people say it sounds
like an arranged marriage.

10:52.526 --> 10:53.492
Have you set a date?

10:53.494 --> 10:54.994
No, not yet.

10:54.996 --> 10:57.329
But if it was up to Susan
it'd probably be this weekend.

10:57.331 --> 10:59.598
She's very excited about it.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.600
Oh, aren't you?

11:00.602 --> 11:01.701
Yeah I am.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.303
I think I am.

11:03.305 --> 11:06.172
After all, I am the groom to be.

11:06.174 --> 11:09.141
I'm sure you'll
have a lovely wedding.

11:09.143 --> 11:10.443
If your fiance likes it here,

11:10.445 --> 11:11.845
I hope you come in the spring.

11:11.847 --> 11:14.146
It's really pretty
when the flowers bloom

11:14.148 --> 11:17.350
and she seems like
a lovely woman.

11:17.352 --> 11:19.919
She has everything a guy
would hope for I imagine.

11:19.921 --> 11:21.987
She's pretty and smart.

11:21.989 --> 11:23.756
And do you love her?

11:23.758 --> 11:24.592
Huh?

11:26.795 --> 11:30.098
Did Mrs. Minnett
show you the windows?

11:32.901 --> 11:35.601
These are the names of the
couples who've stayed here.

11:35.603 --> 11:37.603
And there's an old
story that says

11:37.605 --> 11:39.271
if you spend your honeymoon here

11:39.273 --> 11:41.006
and write your
name on the windows

11:41.008 --> 11:43.308
that the cottage will
bless your marriage.

11:43.310 --> 11:44.677
Hmm.

11:44.679 --> 11:47.746
Pearl and Sam Nisbett, 1936.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.314
Lenny and Kelly Williams, 1842.

11:49.316 --> 11:52.684
Wow there've, wow a lotta
couples stayed here.

11:52.686 --> 11:56.858
Oh, there's pictures of
some of the couples here too.

11:58.225 --> 12:00.928
Hmm, everyone
looks so serious.

12:03.131 --> 12:04.466
They look happy.

12:09.905 --> 12:12.038
There's something special
within these walls

12:12.040 --> 12:13.939
and it has embraced us.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.707
The depth of love we
have felt for one another

12:15.709 --> 12:18.343
under this magical roof has
taken our beautiful love

12:18.345 --> 12:21.914
and strengthened us in a
way we could never imagine.

12:21.916 --> 12:24.983
Everything is more potent,
more intense, more beautiful

12:24.985 --> 12:28.453
because we have rested our
heads on these pillows.

12:28.455 --> 12:30.323
To those who find these words,

12:30.325 --> 12:32.725
know that there's something
here which transcends,

12:32.727 --> 12:34.728
something extraordinary.

12:36.330 --> 12:39.866
Wow, they wrote so
beautifully back them.

12:39.868 --> 12:44.470
Oh this is Mrs. Minnett
and her husband Tom.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.271
She's so young there.

12:46.273 --> 12:47.573
Um hmm.

12:47.575 --> 12:49.509
I like to look at this
book from time to time

12:49.511 --> 12:54.179
and just imagine all of the
couples who've stayed here.

12:54.181 --> 12:56.348
I think the cottage
is enchanted.

12:56.350 --> 12:57.549
Enchanted?

12:57.551 --> 12:58.518
Yeah, I think that every time

12:58.520 --> 13:00.019
couples come into the cottage,

13:00.021 --> 13:02.757
their love was
somehow magnified.

13:03.757 --> 13:04.593
Hmm.

13:12.334 --> 13:14.833
So, what do you think?

13:14.835 --> 13:16.836
I admit this place
has its charm its...

13:16.838 --> 13:19.505
Well, I have it on
first hand account

13:19.507 --> 13:23.375
that this place is not only
charming, it's enchanted.

13:23.377 --> 13:24.611
Isn't that right?

13:24.613 --> 13:26.980
Yeah.

13:26.982 --> 13:28.414
I know that if we
spent our honeymoon here,

13:28.416 --> 13:30.482
we will live happily ever after.

13:30.484 --> 13:32.152
So, what do you say?

13:33.588 --> 13:35.388
If it makes you
happy we can stay here.

13:35.390 --> 13:36.588
Great, then it's settled.

13:36.590 --> 13:38.091
Mrs. Minnett, I
will get you a check

13:38.093 --> 13:40.360
and Susan and I will
pick out a date.

13:40.362 --> 13:41.294
Oliver.

13:41.296 --> 13:42.794
Oh, sorry, we have to go.

13:42.796 --> 13:43.795
Good to see you Mrs. Minnett.

13:43.797 --> 13:44.597
It was great to see you.

13:44.599 --> 13:45.899
And thank you um?

13:45.901 --> 13:46.866
Oh, Laura.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.067
Laura.

13:48.069 --> 13:49.635
We'll be seeing you
again shortly I'm sure.

13:49.637 --> 13:51.069
It's good to see you again.

13:51.071 --> 13:51.871
- Good to see you as well.
- Nice to meet you.

13:51.873 --> 13:52.538
Likewise.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.872
Take care.

13:53.874 --> 13:54.708
Bye.

13:58.680 --> 13:59.946
Hello?

13:59.948 --> 14:01.182
Hey, what's up?

14:02.050 --> 14:02.883
What?

14:04.652 --> 14:05.851
Who was that?

14:05.853 --> 14:07.153
Turn on the TV.

14:07.155 --> 14:08.621
Lots of smoke.

14:08.623 --> 14:12.359
The 2nd tower, we still see
flames coming out of the window.

14:13.828 --> 14:15.260
Appears to
be absolutely nothing wrong

14:15.262 --> 14:18.999
with the building.

14:20.535 --> 14:21.934
While you say Prairie Hill.

14:29.009 --> 14:31.845
Holy shit, Mark.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.456
Oliver, what is this?

14:46.527 --> 14:47.861
Can't you see?

14:50.331 --> 14:51.432
We're at war.

14:54.169 --> 14:55.334
I can hear you.

15:01.542 --> 15:05.311
I can hear you, the rest
of the world hears you.

15:05.313 --> 15:08.481
And the people who knocked
these buildings down

15:08.483 --> 15:10.316
will hear all of us soon.

15:14.022 --> 15:17.157
U.S.A.,
U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.034
Dad!

15:29.771 --> 15:30.604
Dad?

15:33.108 --> 15:35.674
Why are my orders
being reconsidered?

15:35.676 --> 15:37.677
I have no idea.

15:37.679 --> 15:40.313
Of course you don't.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.780
Did you call your friend
in the State Department

15:41.782 --> 15:44.618
and have him change
my deployment?

15:46.121 --> 15:48.520
Why would you do that?

15:48.522 --> 15:49.356
Why?

15:50.758 --> 15:52.592
You're my son.

15:52.594 --> 15:53.860
I don't want you
putting your life...

15:53.862 --> 15:55.160
That is not your
decision to make.

15:55.162 --> 15:57.831
Going off to war is a mistake.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.665
If you're determined to serve,

16:00.667 --> 16:02.201
at least you can serve your
time here in the states.

16:02.203 --> 16:05.404
I'm gonna do this whether
you want me to or not.

16:05.406 --> 16:06.240
I have to.

16:07.642 --> 16:09.976
You don't understand.

16:09.978 --> 16:12.345
There are no heroes in war.

16:12.347 --> 16:13.515
Just the dead.

16:14.715 --> 16:17.750
Let everyone else
go off and fight.

16:17.752 --> 16:21.553
Why of all the paths you could
take, must it be this one?

16:21.555 --> 16:23.155
If anything happened
to you, your mother...

16:23.157 --> 16:25.357
Do not make this about mom.

16:25.359 --> 16:26.192
I promised I'd watch...

16:26.194 --> 16:27.760
And you have.

16:27.762 --> 16:30.295
But right now the country
needs everyone they can get.

16:30.297 --> 16:32.631
Did you see what they did to us?

16:32.633 --> 16:37.135
If I don't go I will regret
it for the rest of my life.

16:37.137 --> 16:39.138
You need to make this right Dad.

16:47.648 --> 16:48.880
Dear Mrs. Minnett.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.716
I wanted to first thank
you for your kindness

16:50.718 --> 16:52.351
in showing Oliver and me around

16:52.353 --> 16:54.620
when we visited
your lovely cottage.

16:54.622 --> 16:57.356
Unfortunately we will have to
wait to celebrate our wedding

16:57.358 --> 17:02.028
and honeymoon as Oliver has
been called to duty overseas.

17:02.030 --> 17:05.464
At the moment I am not sure
when we will be wanting to stay.

17:05.467 --> 17:07.699
It is our intention to
celebrate our honeymoon there

17:07.701 --> 17:10.669
when he returns and I will
keep you posted as his schedule

17:10.671 --> 17:13.407
and your plans
become more clear.

17:14.741 --> 17:16.942
And he wanted to let you know

17:16.944 --> 17:18.643
that he looks forward
to staying there

17:18.645 --> 17:20.313
and wanted me to send a check

17:20.315 --> 17:24.082
to pay for any inconvenience
that we may have caused.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.517
Again, thank you for the effort

17:25.519 --> 17:27.352
you have put in on our behalf.

17:27.354 --> 17:29.356
Sincerely, Susan Layton.

17:38.932 --> 17:41.633
I know that the families
of our military are praying

17:41.635 --> 17:46.438
that all those who serve
will return safely and soon.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.707
Millions of Americans
are praying with you

17:48.709 --> 17:50.743
for the safety of
your loved ones

17:50.745 --> 17:54.015
and for the protection
of the innocent.

18:52.239 --> 18:53.605
Oh!

18:53.607 --> 18:55.608
Laura you startled me.

18:55.610 --> 18:57.075
Quick, come in.

18:57.077 --> 18:58.377
Hey, what's going on?

18:58.379 --> 19:00.412
I heard the car and
saw those people.

19:00.414 --> 19:01.781
Are you okay?

19:01.783 --> 19:02.982
I need your help.

19:02.984 --> 19:04.115
Okay, were those
guys military?

19:04.117 --> 19:05.584
What's going on?

19:05.586 --> 19:07.085
Remember that young marine
who wanted to stay here

19:07.087 --> 19:08.187
for his honeymoon?

19:08.189 --> 19:09.522
Mr. Bradshaw?

19:09.524 --> 19:10.890
Yes.

19:10.892 --> 19:13.628
Well he's here
and he's not well.

19:14.562 --> 19:15.393
Not well?

19:15.395 --> 19:16.696
Where is he?

19:16.698 --> 19:18.199
He's down there.

19:25.606 --> 19:26.505
Oh God.

19:26.507 --> 19:29.072
What happened to him?

19:29.074 --> 19:29.708
Who were those people?

19:29.710 --> 19:32.311
His friends I imagine.

19:32.313 --> 19:33.512
Is he okay?

19:33.514 --> 19:35.614
What happened to him?

19:35.616 --> 19:38.117
He just said he was injured.

19:38.119 --> 19:40.253
Well he has a fever.

19:40.255 --> 19:43.855
Look, I don't think we
should be doing this.

19:43.857 --> 19:46.124
Did they leave a
number or anything?

19:46.126 --> 19:48.995
No and he insisted that we
tell no one that he's here.

19:48.997 --> 19:49.831
Why?

19:51.298 --> 19:54.100
Come on, his family's going
to be wondering where he is.

19:54.102 --> 19:56.002
Are you sure the hospital
even let him leave?

19:56.004 --> 19:57.703
'Cause you could get in
a lotta trouble for this.

19:57.705 --> 19:58.706
I'm aware.

20:00.173 --> 20:01.974
Alright, but they
shouldn't have moved him.

20:01.976 --> 20:06.946
Alright he may have told you
he was ready, but he wasn't.

20:06.948 --> 20:08.246
I will see what I can do.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.547
But if he doesn't
get better soon,

20:09.549 --> 20:10.949
we have to take him
back to the hospital.

20:10.951 --> 20:12.251
Understood?

20:12.253 --> 20:13.254
Of course.

20:14.855 --> 20:16.721
Alright Oliver.

20:16.723 --> 20:18.458
What happened to you?

20:50.792 --> 20:51.957
Hey.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.692
How is he?

20:53.694 --> 20:55.428
A little better I think.

20:55.430 --> 20:57.697
He's gonna need
something for his pain,

20:57.699 --> 20:59.799
but I have a friend at the
V.A. who owes me a favor

20:59.801 --> 21:02.133
so I can probably find out
what kind of medications

21:02.135 --> 21:04.003
he left behind at the hospital.

21:04.005 --> 21:05.804
I'm just gonna head into
work to make the calls

21:05.806 --> 21:07.273
and then get him what he needs.

21:07.275 --> 21:08.774
You can't leave.

21:08.776 --> 21:10.242
What am I supposed to
do while you're gone?

21:10.244 --> 21:13.312
Just keep him hydrated
as best you can.

21:13.314 --> 21:15.113
Give him water or juice.

21:15.115 --> 21:17.149
He's taking small sips now.

21:17.151 --> 21:19.251
And I'll be back with
something as soon as I can.

21:19.253 --> 21:20.486
Okay?

21:20.488 --> 21:22.755
Okay, thank you Laura.

21:22.757 --> 21:23.591
Alright.

21:58.058 --> 22:00.493
I was worried about you
for a while there Oliver.

22:00.495 --> 22:02.394
How are you feeling?

22:02.396 --> 22:03.964
I've been better.

22:05.132 --> 22:06.799
Are you hungry?

22:06.801 --> 22:07.632
I mean you should eat.

22:07.634 --> 22:08.869
I brought soup.

22:16.477 --> 22:18.110
That's some of the
best soup I've ever had.

22:18.112 --> 22:21.114
It's Mrs. Minnett's
secret recipe.

22:22.482 --> 22:25.251
Well I read over
your medical record

22:25.253 --> 22:28.853
and, I mean I don't
have to tell you

22:28.855 --> 22:30.989
what happened to
your face and chest.

22:30.991 --> 22:33.292
So you're gonna need
some physical therapy

22:33.294 --> 22:37.162
and maybe some help
to get past the trauma

22:37.164 --> 22:40.032
of what you've experienced.

22:40.034 --> 22:42.066
Do you mind if I ask
you a few questions?

22:42.068 --> 22:42.903
No.

22:44.238 --> 22:46.841
Why did you leave the hospital?

22:50.378 --> 22:53.912
I couldn't stand all
the people starring at me.

22:53.914 --> 22:57.049
And they were whispering
under their breaths.

22:57.051 --> 23:00.721
I didn't wanna, I didn't
want them to see me.

23:02.422 --> 23:03.257
Who?

23:04.158 --> 23:05.993
My father and Susan.

23:07.161 --> 23:11.229
So I had a couple of my
buddies bring me here.

23:11.231 --> 23:12.132
Why here?

23:13.500 --> 23:16.534
It's the most secluded
place I could think of.

23:16.536 --> 23:20.475
And I thought I could
use a little enchantment.

23:23.744 --> 23:25.513
Do you have a mirror?

23:27.381 --> 23:28.716
Maybe not now.

23:29.650 --> 23:30.485
Please.

23:45.866 --> 23:49.034
You know but you've
been through a lot.

23:49.036 --> 23:52.103
And your family
has to be worried.

23:52.105 --> 23:53.572
You can give me their number.

23:53.574 --> 23:56.576
I'll call, let 'em
know you're okay.

24:00.014 --> 24:02.016
Do you have my things?

24:02.984 --> 24:03.885
Um, yeah.

24:05.385 --> 24:06.886
This?

24:06.888 --> 24:08.454
Could you bring
that to me please?

24:08.456 --> 24:10.188
Hey, do you want
me to get you something?

24:10.190 --> 24:11.526
No, thank you.

24:14.761 --> 24:18.098
If you don't mind,
I'd like to be alone.

24:56.703 --> 24:59.973
Mr. Bradshaw I was
just thinking that.

25:00.841 --> 25:01.676
Don't.

25:02.677 --> 25:03.511
Please.

25:23.730 --> 25:24.565
I'm sorry.

25:26.667 --> 25:29.503
I'm so sorry this
happened to you.

25:49.323 --> 25:51.092
Hi, my name is Laura.

25:52.293 --> 25:55.796
I was hoping to speak
with a Mr. Bradshaw.

26:08.976 --> 26:11.646
Your father's here to see you.

26:21.721 --> 26:22.553
Don't look.

26:22.555 --> 26:23.623
Let me see.

26:26.661 --> 26:29.027
They did quite a
number on you son.

26:29.029 --> 26:31.764
Is there where you
tell me you told me so?

26:31.766 --> 26:33.732
If so I don't wanna
talk about it.

26:33.734 --> 26:35.566
What were you thinking
leaving the hospital?

26:35.568 --> 26:38.070
You had me worried to death.

26:38.072 --> 26:39.138
Well you're through hiding out.

26:39.140 --> 26:39.971
Do you understand?

26:39.973 --> 26:40.805
No.

26:40.807 --> 26:42.440
I don't understand.

26:42.442 --> 26:43.676
Can you just skip the lecture?

26:43.678 --> 26:45.143
I'm not in the mood for it.

26:45.145 --> 26:46.844
I didn't come all this
way just to leave you here.

26:46.846 --> 26:49.881
You're going back home
where you can recover.

26:49.883 --> 26:51.315
It's not gonna do you
any good staying here

26:51.317 --> 26:53.284
feeling sorry for yourself.

26:53.286 --> 26:55.086
There are soldiers in
far worse condition.

26:55.088 --> 26:57.221
You don't see them hiding
themselves from the world.

26:57.223 --> 26:58.890
That's why they
call it hiding.

26:58.892 --> 27:00.124
Don't be so dramatic.

27:00.126 --> 27:01.293
You make it sound
like being sent home

27:01.295 --> 27:02.695
is a prison sentence.

27:02.697 --> 27:03.961
I don't wanna argue with you,

27:03.963 --> 27:07.131
but right now I'm
not going anywhere.

27:07.133 --> 27:08.367
And what do I tell Susan?

27:08.369 --> 27:10.134
Tell her whatever you want.

27:10.136 --> 27:11.870
Do you understand?

27:11.872 --> 27:14.275
I just want to be left alone.

27:31.726 --> 27:33.728
I coulda known better.

27:37.097 --> 27:39.130
Who's been taking care of him?

27:39.132 --> 27:40.234
A neighbor.

27:41.434 --> 27:43.569
She's a nurse and a friend.

27:43.571 --> 27:45.970
She comes by when she's
not at the hospital.

27:45.972 --> 27:47.939
Is she good?

27:47.941 --> 27:50.575
Oliver seems to think so.

27:50.577 --> 27:53.478
Let me know what she needs
to take care of him full time.

27:53.480 --> 27:55.413
Whatever she needs,
twice her hospital salary

27:55.415 --> 27:57.115
if that'll do it.

27:57.117 --> 27:59.717
I'll cover all the costs.

27:59.719 --> 28:02.957
He may be an ass but
he's still my son.

28:04.091 --> 28:06.425
Let me know if he
needs anything, okay?

28:06.427 --> 28:07.892
I will.

28:16.370 --> 28:18.336
You know you're quite
the mystery to me.

28:18.338 --> 28:20.572
Yeah, how's that?

28:20.574 --> 28:23.007
Well you just seem to
appear whenever I need you

28:23.009 --> 28:26.311
and I don't really know
anything about you.

28:26.313 --> 28:29.848
Alright well, what
would you like to know?

28:29.850 --> 28:32.586
I don't know,
tell me anything.

28:34.555 --> 28:36.721
My life's not
very interesting.

28:36.723 --> 28:39.591
I've been lying in a bed
for several weeks right now

28:39.593 --> 28:42.095
and everything is interesting.

28:44.498 --> 28:48.266
Okay, well my parents
died a few years ago.

28:48.268 --> 28:51.370
I don't have any
brothers or sisters.

28:51.372 --> 28:53.104
I've lived in White
Oak my whole life.

28:53.106 --> 28:55.041
I've never really left.

28:55.910 --> 28:58.512
I'm a nurse, but you know that.

28:59.412 --> 29:00.379
I like to read.

29:00.381 --> 29:01.612
I don't know.

29:01.614 --> 29:02.782
Fascinating.

29:03.717 --> 29:06.584
I guess that covers it all.

29:06.586 --> 29:07.520
Romances?

29:10.090 --> 29:11.390
Oh, I'm sorry.

29:11.392 --> 29:12.623
You don't have to talk about it

29:12.625 --> 29:15.762
- if you don't want to.
- No, no, it's okay.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.198
I know this sounds
kind of stupid,

29:20.200 --> 29:24.669
but the truth is I've never
really had a boyfriend.

29:24.671 --> 29:25.773
Never ever?

29:27.473 --> 29:28.707
You're making fun
of me, aren't you?

29:28.709 --> 29:30.242
No, no.

29:30.244 --> 29:32.246
Why would that be funny?

29:33.247 --> 29:34.414
I'm awkward.

29:36.784 --> 29:39.453
At least around men I'm awkward.

29:40.587 --> 29:42.086
You don't seem
that way around me.

29:42.088 --> 29:43.822
Yeah, you're a patient.

29:43.824 --> 29:45.524
Well, no and a friend.

29:45.526 --> 29:46.992
And a friend.

29:46.994 --> 29:50.728
I, oh it's just that I
don't have to impress you.

29:50.730 --> 29:52.831
Well not that I would
have to impress a man.

29:52.833 --> 29:55.100
It's just you know I wouldn't
wanna act like an idiot

29:55.102 --> 29:57.468
in front of someone,
especially you know someone

29:57.470 --> 29:59.137
whom I found attractive.

29:59.139 --> 30:01.239
Well not that I
find you attractive.

30:01.241 --> 30:03.041
Well no no, wait and not
that you're not attractive,

30:03.043 --> 30:06.378
because you are,
very, like attractive.

30:06.380 --> 30:08.280
Okay, I'm shutting up now.

30:08.282 --> 30:10.114
Sorry.

30:10.116 --> 30:13.384
You know I really
like you Laura.

30:13.386 --> 30:14.787
I like you too.

30:25.065 --> 30:27.698
Mr. Bradshaw,
you have a visitor.

30:27.700 --> 30:29.234
I'm sorry sir.

30:29.236 --> 30:34.206
Mrs. Minnett, I am not in the
mood for visitors right now.

30:34.208 --> 30:36.007
So I take it I'm an intrusion.

30:36.009 --> 30:37.242
No sir, it's...

30:37.244 --> 30:38.877
Maury Hillgrove,
pleasure to meet you.

30:38.879 --> 30:41.178
Major Maury Hillgrove.

30:41.180 --> 30:42.714
Did Veteran Affairs send you?

30:42.716 --> 30:45.617
No, I decided to stop
by and introduce myself.

30:45.619 --> 30:48.286
Let you know that if you
need anyone to talk to,

30:48.288 --> 30:49.854
I'm available.

30:49.856 --> 30:52.890
So then my father sent you?

30:52.892 --> 30:56.394
I think your father thought
you might appreciate a friend.

30:56.396 --> 30:59.464
I think my father
missed the point.

30:59.466 --> 31:03.936
I came here for the express
purpose of being alone.

31:03.938 --> 31:06.607
They told me you were injured.

31:08.909 --> 31:12.513
I have burns, scars
on my face and chest.

31:13.780 --> 31:15.246
I keep hearing
sounds of the war.

31:15.248 --> 31:16.448
I can't sleep.

31:16.450 --> 31:18.550
I have a reoccurring
nightmare where.

31:18.552 --> 31:20.988
Sir, I don't mean to be rude,

31:22.389 --> 31:24.488
but if you came here to give
me some sort of pep talk

31:24.490 --> 31:26.958
or tell me how everything
is going to be just fine...

31:26.960 --> 31:30.661
I wouldn't presume to tell
you how you should feel.

31:30.663 --> 31:32.398
Wouldn't do any good.

31:34.267 --> 31:37.436
I am gonna have
to agree with you.

31:37.438 --> 31:40.639
Look, I just came here
to introduce myself.

31:40.641 --> 31:44.709
I came to be the conduit for
you to see the outside world.

31:44.711 --> 31:48.882
Frankly, for someone who's
blind, I've seen a great deal.

31:50.116 --> 31:52.950
I've seen men just like you.

31:52.952 --> 31:55.519
You didn't like the
life you had before.

31:55.521 --> 31:58.924
And now that it's gone,
you want it back so badly

31:58.926 --> 32:00.958
you can't appreciate
the life ahead of you.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.928
You don't know
anything about me.

32:02.930 --> 32:03.764
True.

32:05.565 --> 32:09.266
Your father said that he
didn't want you to serve.

32:09.268 --> 32:11.436
Do you doubt your service now?

32:11.438 --> 32:14.339
It was a waste of time
and it was a waste of lives.

32:14.341 --> 32:16.007
We could argue that.

32:16.009 --> 32:17.175
It depends on your
point of view.

32:17.177 --> 32:19.276
Did you ever
serve in combat sir?

32:19.278 --> 32:22.115
Vietnam, lost
my eyesight there.

32:22.982 --> 32:24.115
Sorry.

32:24.117 --> 32:25.583
You adapt.

32:25.585 --> 32:28.387
You know sometimes an
injury can help you see

32:28.389 --> 32:30.589
the beauty that you
couldn't see before.

32:30.591 --> 32:31.857
How's that?

32:31.859 --> 32:33.691
Well I have to rely
on my other senses.

32:33.693 --> 32:35.761
Touch, smell, sound.

32:35.763 --> 32:37.661
I mean the world's
exactly the same.

32:37.663 --> 32:41.132
But the appreciation
is vastly different.

32:41.134 --> 32:42.633
Oh and better.

32:42.635 --> 32:45.469
You can't tell me that you
don't miss your eyesight.

32:45.471 --> 32:48.873
Oh, I do, I do time and again.

32:48.875 --> 32:53.144
But I've realized that no
matter how much I dwelt on it,

32:53.146 --> 32:56.180
nothing was going to change.

32:56.182 --> 32:57.748
If I wanted to be happier

32:57.750 --> 33:00.384
I had to make it
happen for myself.

33:00.386 --> 33:03.721
And I also realized just
'cause you're injured

33:03.723 --> 33:05.491
your life isn't over.

33:06.994 --> 33:09.894
I think we'll just have
to agree to disagree then.

33:09.896 --> 33:12.797
Or you could just
take my word for it.

33:12.799 --> 33:15.969
All I can say is
that, it gets easier.

33:18.838 --> 33:21.672
Well, I don't wanna
overstay my welcome.

33:21.674 --> 33:22.908
It's usually about this point

33:22.910 --> 33:26.311
that I'm asked if
I'm coming back.

33:26.313 --> 33:27.912
Will you?

33:27.914 --> 33:31.015
I thought you'd never ask.

33:48.134 --> 33:50.235
Shouldn't you buy
me a drink first?

33:50.237 --> 33:51.836
- Buy you a drink?
- Yeah.

33:51.838 --> 33:54.505
Oh, I don't think so.

33:54.507 --> 33:56.774
You know when you
can walk again,

33:56.776 --> 33:58.743
you'll be doing the buying.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.178
Which won't take very long.

34:00.180 --> 34:02.714
Before you know it, you're
going to be running.

34:02.716 --> 34:04.248
Will I be a good dancer too?

34:04.250 --> 34:05.516
Yeah, of course.

34:05.518 --> 34:06.751
Great, 'cause I
was awful before.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.920
Okay,
you're terrible.

34:08.922 --> 34:10.154
Just keep pumping those legs.

34:10.156 --> 34:11.956
They're not gonna
rebuild themselves.

34:11.958 --> 34:13.190
Yes.

34:13.192 --> 34:16.428
We can make him better
than he was before.

34:16.429 --> 34:20.598
Better, stronger,
faster.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.266
Who knows.

34:22.268 --> 34:24.201
- Six billion dollar man?
- Yeah.

34:24.203 --> 34:26.036
Well who doesn't?

34:26.038 --> 34:30.208
My dad and I used to watch
old reruns when I was a kid.

34:30.210 --> 34:32.511
Da na na na na na na na na.

34:32.513 --> 34:33.712
Da na na
na na na na na na.

34:35.149 --> 34:37.417
Da na na na na na na na na.

34:43.089 --> 34:44.589
Surprise.

34:44.591 --> 34:47.625
What, you're transferring
me to a senior citizen center?

34:47.627 --> 34:48.960
It's a walker.

34:53.299 --> 34:55.833
You know I think I preferred
it when you drove me hoke.

34:55.835 --> 34:57.935
Ah well, I'm so
sorry Mrs. Daisy,

34:57.937 --> 34:59.471
but you're gonna
have to find your way

34:59.473 --> 35:02.574
to the Piggly Wiggly all
on your own from now on.

35:02.576 --> 35:04.678
You ready to try to walk?

35:06.145 --> 35:09.915
Okay, so the first thing we
need to do is just to stand up.

35:09.917 --> 35:11.149
But to do that you're going to

35:11.151 --> 35:13.317
push with your arms up
on the walker, okay?

35:13.319 --> 35:15.252
And then you're gonna just
stand up really straight.

35:15.254 --> 35:16.087
Ready?

35:16.089 --> 35:18.190
Push, there you go.

35:18.192 --> 35:20.125
Good.

35:20.127 --> 35:21.125
Alright.

35:21.127 --> 35:22.159
That's okay.

35:22.161 --> 35:23.428
That was the easy part.

35:23.430 --> 35:24.261
Now can you take

35:24.263 --> 35:25.462
a couple of steps?

35:25.464 --> 35:27.199
Okay, so we're just
gonna do the same thing

35:27.201 --> 35:28.667
over and over again, right?

35:28.669 --> 35:30.801
We're gonna push forward,
gonna take a few steps

35:30.803 --> 35:32.304
and then you're gonna
stand up straight.

35:32.306 --> 35:33.504
Okay, ready?

35:33.506 --> 35:34.575
Push forward.

35:37.277 --> 35:38.111
Good.

35:40.379 --> 35:41.679
Okay, again.

35:41.681 --> 35:42.714
Push forward.

35:42.716 --> 35:44.683
Take a couple steps.

35:44.685 --> 35:46.753
Stand up really straight.

35:47.988 --> 35:48.920
Good.

35:48.922 --> 35:50.388
See?

35:50.390 --> 35:51.922
I feel like I should be
recording this or something.

35:51.924 --> 35:53.658
You're like Neil Armstrong

35:53.660 --> 35:57.495
taking your first steps
on the moon, you know?

35:57.497 --> 35:58.929
Good.

35:58.931 --> 36:00.031
Keep going.

36:00.033 --> 36:01.201
Nice and slow.

36:52.718 --> 36:54.286
He was in great spirits.

36:54.288 --> 36:56.821
It was one of those
amazing learning things.

36:56.823 --> 36:59.391
I could actually
hear him smiling.

36:59.393 --> 37:00.692
I can see how that
might be rewarding

37:00.694 --> 37:02.259
on a number of levels.

37:02.261 --> 37:04.129
So how 'bout you?

37:04.131 --> 37:05.230
What about me?

37:05.232 --> 37:07.299
Smiling these days?

37:07.301 --> 37:08.667
A bit.

37:08.669 --> 37:10.134
Eh, that's a start.

37:10.136 --> 37:11.569
I've told ya, the inside takes

37:11.571 --> 37:13.672
Much longer
than the outside to heal.

37:13.674 --> 37:15.005
Yes.

37:15.007 --> 37:16.176
Once or twice.

37:17.611 --> 37:19.643
You also told me I'd start
to learn who I'm to become.

37:19.645 --> 37:22.781
But, I only seem to
know who I'm not.

37:22.783 --> 37:24.114
Hmm.

37:24.116 --> 37:25.683
What do I do?

37:25.685 --> 37:27.319
Do I just wait until
I wake up one morning

37:27.321 --> 37:29.321
and know who I am?

37:29.323 --> 37:33.091
I suspect that until you
let go of who you were,

37:33.093 --> 37:35.726
you won't be able to
define who you are.

37:35.728 --> 37:40.098
You need to resolve things with
the people you left behind.

37:40.100 --> 37:42.400
The ones you're hiding from.

37:42.402 --> 37:43.403
My father.

37:45.672 --> 37:46.904
And Susan.

37:46.906 --> 37:47.740
Um hmm.

37:55.247 --> 37:56.413
Oliver.

37:56.415 --> 37:59.486
You might not wanna
come any closer.

38:00.486 --> 38:02.655
I brought you something.

38:06.692 --> 38:07.526
Thanks.

38:10.230 --> 38:12.464
You know I love you, no
matter what's happened to you.

38:12.466 --> 38:14.065
Really?

38:14.067 --> 38:16.201
How can you say that?

38:16.203 --> 38:18.002
I haven't seen you for months.

38:18.004 --> 38:20.538
Why didn't you call me?

38:20.540 --> 38:21.975
I wasn't ready.

38:32.986 --> 38:33.819
Nothing?

38:38.257 --> 38:41.393
I take it my father didn't
tell you what to expect.

38:41.395 --> 38:42.794
It's not that I just...

38:42.796 --> 38:44.797
Didn't expect a freak?

38:45.866 --> 38:48.433
You know what, I'm sorry.

38:48.435 --> 38:49.868
I knew that this was a bad idea.

38:49.870 --> 38:53.138
I'm not longer the pretty
picture of a husband

38:53.140 --> 38:54.839
that you had in mind.

38:54.841 --> 38:58.475
And can you imagine,
family formal dinners?

38:58.477 --> 39:01.946
I'd have everyone
talking, oh poor Susan.

39:01.948 --> 39:03.915
It's such a pity.

39:03.917 --> 39:05.683
Oliver I haven't
said anything yet.

39:05.685 --> 39:06.520
I know.

39:07.654 --> 39:10.457
But your silence
has spoken volumes.

39:11.558 --> 39:14.359
I saw those same
looks in the hospital.

39:14.361 --> 39:16.895
It's what happens
next that's worse.

39:16.897 --> 39:21.866
But, you have to see it all
to get the full picture.

39:21.868 --> 39:23.868
Oliver what are you doing?

39:23.870 --> 39:26.004
You wanted to see me.

39:26.006 --> 39:26.839
So look.

39:31.477 --> 39:34.112
I'd wanted to write you,
but since you've come,

39:34.114 --> 39:36.880
I think it's only fair that
you heard it from me directly.

39:36.882 --> 39:39.783
I don't wanna be in this
relationship anymore.

39:39.785 --> 39:40.618
What do you mean Oliver?

39:40.620 --> 39:42.786
You know what I mean.

39:42.788 --> 39:45.089
It's a mercy, really.

39:45.091 --> 39:47.625
I don't want to be engaged.

39:47.627 --> 39:49.627
I don't want to get married.

39:49.629 --> 39:52.129
And I don't want to be in a
relationship with you anymore.

39:52.131 --> 39:53.630
Why, Oliver?

39:53.632 --> 39:57.601
Do you really have to make
this worse than it already is?

39:57.603 --> 40:01.707
Is it really necessary
for everybody to know why?

40:02.942 --> 40:06.345
Isn't it enough that
this is what I want?

40:09.748 --> 40:10.647
I love you.

40:10.649 --> 40:11.484
Do you?

40:13.185 --> 40:15.652
You wanna know the truth Susan?

40:15.654 --> 40:19.089
The truth is that our parents
set us up when we were kids.

40:19.091 --> 40:20.290
Not because they thought

40:20.292 --> 40:21.558
that we were perfect
for each other,

40:21.560 --> 40:22.759
but because they thought

40:22.761 --> 40:24.929
our families would
be stronger together.

40:24.931 --> 40:28.500
And you know what, they
were probably right.

40:28.502 --> 40:32.706
But everything has changed
and I am not that man anymore.

40:34.207 --> 40:37.908
I was only doing what
I was supposed to do.

40:37.910 --> 40:39.144
You understand.

40:42.515 --> 40:43.349
Now go.

40:46.285 --> 40:47.119
Trust me.

40:48.522 --> 40:51.924
Your life will be much
better without me.

41:14.513 --> 41:15.679
I don't think I've
been very good

41:15.681 --> 41:18.149
at following the
Major's advice lately.

41:18.151 --> 41:19.850
Why is that?

41:19.852 --> 41:22.554
I wasn't ready for
Susan's reaction.

41:22.556 --> 41:24.589
What happened?

41:24.591 --> 41:29.027
Well the short version
is that we broke up.

41:29.029 --> 41:33.199
But, that still doesn't
justify the way I handled it.

41:36.169 --> 41:39.002
So what are you gonna do?

41:39.004 --> 41:40.339
What can I do?

41:41.473 --> 41:44.544
She'll be much better
off without me.

41:46.011 --> 41:50.448
Laura, just wanted to say I
really appreciate these walks.

41:50.450 --> 41:52.384
They really mean a lot.

41:54.821 --> 41:55.687
Help me to...

41:55.689 --> 41:56.522
Yeah, I.

41:57.723 --> 41:58.991
I know, me too.

42:00.859 --> 42:04.495
So anyway, the Major says
that if I wanna fully recover

42:04.497 --> 42:06.931
I have to figure out who I am.

42:06.933 --> 42:08.966
On the inside?

42:08.968 --> 42:09.801
Um hmm.

42:09.803 --> 42:10.969
Yeah.

42:10.971 --> 42:13.170
And I never really
thought about it before

42:13.172 --> 42:17.341
and I had ideas what I wanted
to do, who I wanted to be.

42:17.343 --> 42:19.143
But I don't know.

42:19.145 --> 42:22.815
Have you ever asked
yourself what do I want?

42:24.384 --> 42:26.049
For me it's easy.

42:26.051 --> 42:27.951
You know it's a simple life,

42:27.953 --> 42:31.857
a successful career, a
husband, maybe children.

42:34.694 --> 42:36.728
You know I guess
everything society says

42:36.730 --> 42:40.063
you're supposed
to want.

42:40.065 --> 42:41.431
I used to think
that's what I wanted.

42:41.433 --> 42:45.504
But now I don't know,
everything just seems so cloudy.

42:47.707 --> 42:51.275
Well I guess we'll have
to wait and see, huh?

42:51.277 --> 42:54.178
Or get you a new crystal ball.

42:54.180 --> 42:56.346
Right now I think I'd
settle for a Magic 8-Ball.

42:58.718 --> 42:59.518
Yes.

43:00.419 --> 43:01.988
Check back later.

43:13.433 --> 43:14.966
Why are we
making spaghetti again?

43:14.968 --> 43:16.400
Ah, you'll see.

43:16.402 --> 43:18.803
Ah, and the mysterious shroud

43:18.805 --> 43:21.239
around the pasta
preparation continues.

43:21.241 --> 43:22.075
I know.

43:23.109 --> 43:24.511
Ooo yeah, here.

43:26.478 --> 43:27.712
Open your mouth.

43:27.714 --> 43:28.812
What, no, what are you doing?

43:28.814 --> 43:30.013
Just trust me, look that way.

43:30.015 --> 43:33.216
- No.
- Here, yeah, huh?

43:33.218 --> 43:34.553
Alright now eat.

43:39.225 --> 43:40.625
Okay, all we need

43:40.627 --> 43:44.130
is an accordion playing
in the background.

43:45.330 --> 43:49.199
Are you two
gonna keep goofing off

43:49.201 --> 43:51.536
or are you ready to
take food to the table?

43:51.538 --> 43:53.973
So what is the big mystery?

43:55.442 --> 43:57.975
I made spaghetti in
honor of Tom's birthday.

43:57.977 --> 44:00.178
It was his favorite meal.

44:00.180 --> 44:02.846
Tom preferred
staying home with me

44:02.848 --> 44:05.083
and eating my spaghetti
over having a party

44:05.085 --> 44:06.750
or going out to eat.

44:06.752 --> 44:09.286
They don't make 'em
like Tom anymore.

44:09.288 --> 44:12.323
No offense
meant Oliver.

44:12.325 --> 44:13.727
Oh, none taken.

44:15.060 --> 44:18.161
Have you thought
about dating though?

44:18.163 --> 44:19.629
No.

44:19.631 --> 44:22.033
It's different when you're
with the right person.

44:22.035 --> 44:24.368
I don't need to
date anyone else.

44:24.370 --> 44:26.806
No, I'll see him soon enough.

44:28.841 --> 44:31.007
Well, I'm gonna leave
the two of you to dinner

44:31.009 --> 44:33.846
and I'm gonna go
visit my husband.

44:40.185 --> 44:42.120
That was sweet.

44:42.122 --> 44:43.288
And kinda sad.

44:44.690 --> 44:45.692
I envy them.

44:46.658 --> 44:47.859
Oh, you make it sound like

44:47.861 --> 44:50.495
it's something
you'll never have.

44:50.497 --> 44:51.330
Oh, stop.

44:54.600 --> 44:55.866
Where's the pasta sauce?

44:55.868 --> 44:56.969
Over there.

45:13.919 --> 45:15.018
What?

45:15.020 --> 45:15.854
It's okay.

45:17.256 --> 45:18.090
It's okay.

45:23.328 --> 45:25.064
I'm not okay Laura.

45:27.433 --> 45:29.768
When I was in Iraq it was...

45:33.006 --> 45:36.440
A few of us got orders
to set up a perimeter.

45:36.442 --> 45:38.408
My buddies and me.

45:38.410 --> 45:40.111
It's hot there.

45:40.113 --> 45:43.683
The heat hits you in
the face like a brick.

45:44.817 --> 45:47.784
You can barely breathe,
you can barely see.

45:47.786 --> 45:51.154
I heard all hell breaking loose.

45:51.156 --> 45:53.725
Machines guns, artillery, RPGs.

45:57.663 --> 46:00.600
There was a crowd
coming towards us.

46:02.234 --> 46:05.236
We yelled at them to stay back.

46:05.238 --> 46:06.703
But there was too many of them.

46:06.705 --> 46:08.839
And the people started
scrambling and I only had

46:08.841 --> 46:11.509
a second or so to see
whether any of them had guns.

46:11.511 --> 46:15.279
We had a very strict policy
on not engaging civilians.

46:15.281 --> 46:18.284
I remember there
was this one woman.

46:19.986 --> 46:24.156
She was staring at me and
all I could see was her eyes.

46:26.725 --> 46:28.458
She was calling for her husband

46:28.460 --> 46:29.794
and she was trying
to push back me

46:29.796 --> 46:32.064
and I was holding her back.

46:33.565 --> 46:35.901
I shoulda kept my eyes open.

46:38.571 --> 46:42.306
The next thing I
knew an RPG went off.

46:42.308 --> 46:44.911
My buddy Ramirez, he was there.

46:47.747 --> 46:49.679
Then he was gone.

46:49.681 --> 46:52.583
Then I felt this
stinging on my face,

46:52.585 --> 46:54.754
on my hair, I was on fire.

46:56.989 --> 46:58.922
Then I fell over.

46:58.924 --> 47:01.558
And they were on me,
pecking at me like birds.

47:01.560 --> 47:05.631
People, punching me,
slapping me, spitting on me.

47:06.966 --> 47:08.900
And half of my face
was in the sand

47:08.902 --> 47:11.368
and I was almost nose
to nose with O'Donnell,

47:11.370 --> 47:13.205
this farmer from Iowa.

47:16.408 --> 47:18.243
He was ripped in half.

47:19.611 --> 47:22.480
And I kept staring at his face.

47:22.482 --> 47:26.750
His eyes, it was like he
was asking me to help him,

47:26.752 --> 47:29.521
but there was
nothing I could do.

47:31.658 --> 47:34.625
Then I heard the
rumbling of the 50 cal.

47:34.627 --> 47:37.196
Mowing down everyone around me.

47:38.163 --> 47:39.665
Everyone was gone.

47:40.933 --> 47:41.767
Except me.

47:46.105 --> 47:49.709
I remember being looked
at and carried off.

47:51.243 --> 47:52.745
And then darkness.

47:54.047 --> 47:57.817
So every time a glass
breaks or a door slams,

47:59.285 --> 48:00.486
I'm back there.

48:02.055 --> 48:04.721
I keep replaying it in
my mind over and over

48:04.723 --> 48:06.491
like a broken record.

48:07.859 --> 48:10.428
Maybe if I'd paid a
little bit more attention

48:10.430 --> 48:13.230
I could've done something.

48:13.232 --> 48:15.567
My friends wouldn't be dead.

48:16.636 --> 48:18.237
It shoulda been me.

48:22.107 --> 48:22.941
I'm sorry.

48:24.777 --> 48:25.909
Excuse me.

48:25.911 --> 48:26.745
Oliver.

48:41.627 --> 48:43.196
How was your visit?

48:44.663 --> 48:46.665
The day's always hard.

48:53.105 --> 48:55.339
Laura, are you okay?

48:55.341 --> 48:56.275
I'm fine.

48:59.245 --> 49:01.078
I'm not fine.

49:01.080 --> 49:02.480
Well it's Oliver,

49:02.482 --> 49:04.681
he had a rough night.

49:04.683 --> 49:06.850
He told me about
what happened to him

49:06.852 --> 49:11.321
and I don't think he was
ready to talk about it.

49:11.323 --> 49:14.726
Laura I think I
should raise a concern.

49:15.761 --> 49:16.595
Alright.

49:18.196 --> 49:22.200
What is the nature of
your interest in Oliver?

49:24.102 --> 49:24.936
I...

49:27.205 --> 49:30.674
I think I might be starting
to have feelings for him.

49:30.676 --> 49:32.275
And my interests lie
somewhere in that.

49:32.277 --> 49:34.578
I know, I know I
shouldn't feel anything.

49:34.580 --> 49:38.317
He's a patient, but, we
have this connection.

49:39.419 --> 49:42.053
Is it a connection
or is it pity?

49:42.055 --> 49:43.120
Oh I'm not sure.

49:43.122 --> 49:43.953
Laura!

49:43.955 --> 49:45.390
I know, I know.

49:47.125 --> 49:50.928
I'm not gonna tell
you what you should do.

49:50.930 --> 49:53.563
But I don't wanna
see you get hurt.

49:53.565 --> 49:54.399
Or him.

49:55.368 --> 49:57.734
He's been through enough.

49:57.736 --> 49:59.502
He has to get back to his life.

49:59.504 --> 50:00.338
I know.

50:01.274 --> 50:04.308
But, I don't wanna let him go.

50:27.200 --> 50:28.031
Morning.

50:28.033 --> 50:29.301
Good morning.

50:30.402 --> 50:32.469
We need to talk.

50:32.471 --> 50:37.373
That's usually the
universal sign for bad news.

50:37.375 --> 50:40.344
Oh, I just wanted
to let you know,

50:40.346 --> 50:42.446
I need to go back to work.

50:42.448 --> 50:46.285
They need me and I feel
like I should move on.

50:47.486 --> 50:48.886
Wait a minute,
I still need you.

50:48.888 --> 50:50.855
No, no you don't.

50:50.857 --> 50:54.024
Every day you're
better, stronger.

50:54.026 --> 50:57.460
And I feel like I might just
be holding you back now.

50:57.462 --> 50:59.231
I don't understand.

51:03.201 --> 51:04.035
Um,

51:06.105 --> 51:07.373
I think that I,

51:09.308 --> 51:11.208
I think that I might be starting
to have feelings for you

51:11.210 --> 51:13.143
and I'm not supposed to do that.

51:13.145 --> 51:16.279
So I need to get back
to work, back to my life

51:16.281 --> 51:17.781
and so do you.

51:17.783 --> 51:21.919
So I just, I just
wanted to say goodbye.

51:21.921 --> 51:23.554
I'm sorry, I have to go.

51:23.556 --> 51:24.388
Wait, wait, wait.

51:24.390 --> 51:25.223
What if,

51:28.426 --> 51:32.629
what if there was
something more between us?

51:32.631 --> 51:34.063
What do you mean?

51:34.065 --> 51:34.901
What if,

51:37.002 --> 51:39.536
what if I asked you to marry me?

51:39.538 --> 51:42.005
What?

51:42.007 --> 51:44.808
What if I was your husband?

51:44.810 --> 51:46.743
Okay well what do
you mean by that?

51:46.745 --> 51:48.545
If you want me to marry you

51:48.547 --> 51:50.114
so that you have someone
to take care of you,

51:50.116 --> 51:52.482
there must be dozens
of beautiful women

51:52.484 --> 51:54.018
would be willing to do that.

51:54.020 --> 51:55.688
A beautiful woman?

51:56.989 --> 52:00.426
What beautiful woman
would wanna marry me?

52:03.495 --> 52:04.329
I see.

52:06.665 --> 52:09.299
You want me to marry
you because I possess

52:09.301 --> 52:11.801
the special qualification
of being unattractive.

52:11.803 --> 52:12.937
- No Laura.
- I see.

52:12.939 --> 52:13.772
No.

52:16.475 --> 52:21.045
What I meant was that, no
one would ever take the time

52:21.047 --> 52:23.614
to get to know me or to
accept me for who I am.

52:23.616 --> 52:24.915
Who you are.

52:24.917 --> 52:26.516
That's the question, isn't it?

52:26.518 --> 52:27.352
It is.

52:29.288 --> 52:31.888
I know that no one will
ever wanna be with me.

52:31.890 --> 52:33.558
The way that I look.

52:37.296 --> 52:41.464
I just, I thought that
we could live together

52:41.466 --> 52:42.966
and be friends.

52:42.968 --> 52:46.538
I know that I can't offer
you anything more than that.

52:47.573 --> 52:50.741
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

52:50.743 --> 52:51.677
Don't be.

52:53.178 --> 52:56.647
It's not like I'm
unaware of how I look.

52:56.649 --> 53:00.752
I guess it was just the shock
of hearing it put so bluntly.

53:01.921 --> 53:04.355
You know you need to
understand something.

53:04.357 --> 53:07.091
If you ever approach a
woman who is unattractive

53:07.093 --> 53:08.725
the way you just
did, remember this:

53:08.727 --> 53:12.862
Okay, even an ugly woman,
as conscious as she may be

53:12.864 --> 53:14.698
of her defects has dreams.

53:14.700 --> 53:18.736
Okay, dreams where she
is lovely and desirable.

53:18.738 --> 53:22.908
And to spare her, to complete
an awakening is a charity.

53:23.776 --> 53:24.609
Laura.

53:28.214 --> 53:30.650
Will you just think about it?

54:41.020 --> 54:41.853
Laura?

54:42.888 --> 54:44.922
Yeah, yes I'm Laura.

54:44.924 --> 54:47.290
You must be Mr. Bradshaw.

54:47.292 --> 54:49.058
It's a pleasure to meet you.

54:49.060 --> 54:53.131
Well I wish it were
under better circumstances.

54:54.933 --> 54:56.699
I must admit it was a surprise

54:56.701 --> 54:59.435
when I received the
phone call from my son

54:59.437 --> 55:02.438
telling me he was
getting married.

55:02.440 --> 55:04.341
It was even more of a
surprise to find out

55:04.343 --> 55:06.344
it wasn't to his fiance.

55:07.680 --> 55:10.279
An explanation please.

55:10.281 --> 55:12.583
Well Oliver and
I have grown close

55:12.585 --> 55:13.984
over the past few months.

55:13.986 --> 55:18.156
And you
actually think he loves you?

55:20.058 --> 55:21.292
I don't know.

55:23.562 --> 55:25.795
I don't mean to
spoil the illusion

55:25.797 --> 55:28.598
but I think we both
know better than that.

55:28.600 --> 55:31.868
Oliver hasn't been
himself since he returned.

55:31.870 --> 55:33.370
You have to know that.

55:33.372 --> 55:35.105
So, what is it?

55:35.107 --> 55:37.274
Why are you doing it?

55:37.276 --> 55:41.446
If it's a matter of money,
I can take care of that.

55:42.848 --> 55:44.547
Wait, you're here to
get rid of me, aren't you?

55:44.549 --> 55:48.720
I'm here to prevent a mistake
that should never happen.

55:50.156 --> 55:52.091
What do you want Laura?

55:53.292 --> 55:54.125
$100,000?

55:55.294 --> 55:56.560
- No.
- A million.

55:56.562 --> 55:58.661
No there isn't any
amount I would take.

55:58.663 --> 56:00.297
Okay, it isn't
about that for me.

56:00.299 --> 56:01.397
Enlighten me please.

56:01.399 --> 56:02.565
I love Oliver.

56:02.567 --> 56:04.033
That's not true.

56:04.035 --> 56:06.402
If you loved him,
you'd know he's in

56:06.404 --> 56:08.906
no position to decide
to get married.

56:08.908 --> 56:11.674
Look, I thought I could leave.

56:11.676 --> 56:13.476
I tried, okay?

56:13.478 --> 56:14.978
But I can't.

56:14.980 --> 56:17.448
Look I don't know what you've
been through Mr. Bradshaw,

56:17.450 --> 56:20.384
and I, I can't imagine
what it must be like

56:20.386 --> 56:23.085
to have a son
injured in the war.

56:23.087 --> 56:26.190
And I know you only wish
what is best for Oliver.

56:26.192 --> 56:27.026
I do.

56:28.426 --> 56:29.260
So do I.

56:30.962 --> 56:34.533
Look, I am a woman of
no great distinction.

56:35.968 --> 56:39.636
Okay, I know I'm not what
many would consider pretty.

56:39.638 --> 56:43.306
I'm not from a family
of great affluence.

56:43.308 --> 56:45.208
When all is said and done,
I'm not sure if my life

56:45.210 --> 56:47.044
will have mattered
to anyone when I die.

56:47.046 --> 56:49.179
But I can tell you this.

56:49.181 --> 56:51.949
Oliver will not be unhappy.

56:51.951 --> 56:53.984
Look, in the short time
that I have known him,

56:53.986 --> 56:56.520
his life has been
better because of me.

56:56.522 --> 56:58.187
He's not the person
he used to be.

56:58.189 --> 57:00.924
And you're right, he's not the
person he's going to be yet.

57:00.926 --> 57:04.560
But, if I can help him
to find himself again,

57:04.562 --> 57:08.733
then, then I think that is
a worthy cause for my life.

57:10.301 --> 57:13.170
Every person has a
value, Mr. Bradshaw,

57:13.172 --> 57:17.774
but that value is not measured
in position or possessions.

57:17.776 --> 57:19.710
A person's value is
measured in love.

57:19.712 --> 57:23.779
And if that is true, then
Oliver is going to be

57:23.781 --> 57:26.218
the richest man in the world.

57:28.486 --> 57:31.554
I don't wanna lose my son.

57:31.556 --> 57:33.459
Oh you won't.

57:38.931 --> 57:41.433
You're a strong woman Laura.

57:42.667 --> 57:43.501
I am.

57:44.937 --> 57:48.641
I'm realizing now that my
coming here is a mistake.

57:50.942 --> 57:54.511
I thought that you
would have more sense.

57:54.513 --> 57:58.015
Oliver's going to do
what he's going to do.

57:58.017 --> 58:01.717
I just want you to know I
don't agree with this decision.

58:01.719 --> 58:02.555
I know.

58:06.792 --> 58:08.125
Take care of my son.

58:08.127 --> 58:08.960
I will.

01:00:11.082 --> 01:00:13.518
Why aren't you talking to me?

01:00:16.154 --> 01:00:17.989
You know the reason.

01:00:22.294 --> 01:00:25.562
No, I don't.

01:00:25.564 --> 01:00:28.500
We shouldn't have
gotten married.

01:00:29.535 --> 01:00:32.134
Are you giving up already.

01:00:32.136 --> 01:00:34.571
I'm not giving up.

01:00:34.573 --> 01:00:36.038
Okay, then what is it?

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.908
'Cause if you didn't
wanna do this,

01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:41.611
then why did you ask
me in the first place?

01:00:41.613 --> 01:00:44.346
You're the one who told me.

01:00:44.348 --> 01:00:48.519
I married you because I
didn't wanna face the world.

01:00:51.924 --> 01:00:52.922
Laura.

01:00:52.924 --> 01:00:54.524
What?

01:00:54.526 --> 01:00:55.527
I'm sorry.

01:00:57.228 --> 01:00:58.129
Don't be.

01:01:00.665 --> 01:01:01.698
It's my fault.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.000
I feel like such an idiot.

01:01:04.002 --> 01:01:05.335
I don't wanna hurt
you, it's just...

01:01:05.337 --> 01:01:06.338
Just what?

01:01:08.172 --> 01:01:09.605
I'm doing this for you.

01:01:09.607 --> 01:01:11.442
Oh please, spare me.

01:01:12.611 --> 01:01:15.277
I've come up with
every rationalization

01:01:15.279 --> 01:01:17.813
to justify marrying you.

01:01:17.815 --> 01:01:19.015
I didn't wanna be alone.

01:01:19.017 --> 01:01:20.716
I wanted someone
to take care of me.

01:01:20.718 --> 01:01:22.819
Everything was I, I, I,

01:01:22.821 --> 01:01:24.554
- I was being selfish.
- Don't, don't.

01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:25.388
Don't lie to me.

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:27.223
I'm not what you want.

01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:28.324
I never have been.

01:01:28.326 --> 01:01:29.594
You're wrong.

01:01:31.562 --> 01:01:35.632
You are the kindest
person I have ever met.

01:01:35.634 --> 01:01:38.737
You understand me
better than anyone.

01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:42.672
I know how selfish
I've been lately.

01:01:42.674 --> 01:01:45.641
The only reason anyone
would wanna marry me

01:01:45.643 --> 01:01:46.909
is out of pity.

01:01:46.911 --> 01:01:48.911
You're wrong you know.

01:01:48.913 --> 01:01:50.080
What do you mean?

01:01:50.082 --> 01:01:53.549
I didn't marry
you out of pity.

01:01:53.551 --> 01:01:54.884
Then why did you do it?

01:01:56.922 --> 01:01:58.757
Because, I love you.

01:02:00.459 --> 01:02:01.991
You love me?

01:02:01.993 --> 01:02:04.426
Since the moment I met you.

01:02:04.428 --> 01:02:06.096
But, Laura.

01:02:06.098 --> 01:02:08.364
How could you love me?

01:02:08.366 --> 01:02:10.833
You know who I am, you
know what happened to me.

01:02:10.835 --> 01:02:13.839
I know and I want
you to be happy.

01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:19.611
So, if ending our marriage
will do that, then,

01:02:22.547 --> 01:02:23.813
I get it.

01:02:23.815 --> 01:02:25.082
No you don't.

01:02:27.386 --> 01:02:28.219
Laura.

01:02:30.154 --> 01:02:34.325
There are 1001 ways that you
have saved me since I met you.

01:02:35.527 --> 01:02:38.962
You're the finest
person I've ever met.

01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:41.698
You're smart, you're funny,

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.065
you're beautiful.

01:02:43.067 --> 01:02:44.500
I'm not.

01:02:44.502 --> 01:02:45.336
You are.

01:02:47.306 --> 01:02:51.641
You're the most beautiful
woman I've ever met.

01:02:51.643 --> 01:02:53.145
Laura, I love you.

01:02:57.482 --> 01:02:58.317
I do.

01:03:00.152 --> 01:03:01.553
I love you Laura.

01:05:39.143 --> 01:05:40.476
That was...

01:05:40.478 --> 01:05:41.480
Beautiful.

01:05:42.614 --> 01:05:43.612
I love you Oliver.

01:05:43.614 --> 01:05:44.880
I love you too.

01:05:50.788 --> 01:05:52.422
Sex is great.

01:05:52.424 --> 01:05:55.458
No, I know you read
about it and everything,

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:57.462
but oh that was awesome.

01:05:59.131 --> 01:06:01.563
I feel pretty good myself.

01:06:01.565 --> 01:06:02.399
Seriously?

01:06:02.401 --> 01:06:03.799
Um hmm.

01:06:03.801 --> 01:06:04.803
Just okay?

01:06:06.971 --> 01:06:08.237
You gotta be kidding me.

01:06:08.239 --> 01:06:09.674
That was amazing.

01:06:10.875 --> 01:06:12.775
Just wait until I
get better at it.

01:06:12.777 --> 01:06:14.044
You think you're
up for a challenge?

01:06:14.046 --> 01:06:15.277
Yeah.

01:06:15.279 --> 01:06:17.147
Alright, I guess
we'll find out.

01:06:17.149 --> 01:06:18.250
I guess so.

01:06:19.984 --> 01:06:21.652
Where are you going?

01:06:23.422 --> 01:06:25.888
Oh, we never had a chance
to eat our wedding cake.

01:06:25.890 --> 01:06:27.924
And I don't know what
you're supposed to eat

01:06:27.926 --> 01:06:29.692
after making love
for the first time,

01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:32.328
but cake sounds kind of amazing.

01:06:32.330 --> 01:06:33.998
I'll get a knife.

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:37.033
Here.

01:06:37.035 --> 01:06:38.734
Let's do it right.

01:06:38.736 --> 01:06:40.404
Aw, very romantic.

01:07:01.625 --> 01:07:03.627
Hmm, that's pretty good.

01:07:09.935 --> 01:07:12.734
Umm, that's
freaking good cake.

01:07:12.736 --> 01:07:14.237
Um hmm.

01:07:14.239 --> 01:07:16.239
You know what?

01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:17.075
I'm happy.

01:07:18.042 --> 01:07:18.876
Me too.

01:07:23.681 --> 01:07:24.616
So husband,

01:07:26.084 --> 01:07:29.219
see I need to come up with
a better nickname for you.

01:07:29.221 --> 01:07:31.120
Husband doesn't
sound quite right.

01:07:31.122 --> 01:07:32.790
How about, genius?

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:38.194
Ooo, ooo, ooo, or your highness?

01:07:38.196 --> 01:07:39.828
Oh!

01:07:39.830 --> 01:07:41.196
How about ass?

01:07:41.198 --> 01:07:42.031
I like it.

01:07:42.901 --> 01:07:43.969
It fits well.

01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:49.505
You know, I always knew
you were gonna be my husband.

01:07:49.507 --> 01:07:50.707
You did?

01:07:50.709 --> 01:07:51.940
Um hmm.

01:07:51.942 --> 01:07:55.245
I know this sounds
silly, but I don't know,

01:07:55.247 --> 01:07:56.679
there was something about you,

01:07:56.681 --> 01:07:58.848
something about your
face that seemed,

01:07:58.850 --> 01:08:01.150
I don't know, familiar.

01:08:01.152 --> 01:08:03.085
Like a puzzle piece
that fits right.

01:08:05.357 --> 01:08:07.526
You're so handsome Oliver.

01:08:10.895 --> 01:08:11.729
What?

01:08:13.998 --> 01:08:16.231
Your face, your
scars, they're...

01:08:16.233 --> 01:08:17.067
What?

01:08:18.036 --> 01:08:19.770
Come on look, look.

01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:25.140
I don't understand.

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:27.912
How could, they're,
they're gone.

01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:32.214
Okay, that's impossible.

01:08:32.216 --> 01:08:34.850
Or it's a miracle, I mean it
could be a miracle, right?

01:08:34.853 --> 01:08:37.352
Laura, it's not just me.

01:08:37.354 --> 01:08:38.790
Look at yourself.

01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:43.660
Oh my God.

01:08:43.662 --> 01:08:44.859
Oh my God.

01:08:44.862 --> 01:08:46.228
This just doesn't
make any sense.

01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:47.629
It doesn't.

01:08:47.631 --> 01:08:49.598
I mean this can't
be real, right?

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.133
It has to be a
dream or something.

01:08:51.135 --> 01:08:52.801
Things like this
aren't possible,

01:08:52.804 --> 01:08:53.734
they don't just happen.

01:08:53.737 --> 01:08:55.136
They don't, no.

01:08:55.139 --> 01:08:59.642
Well then, there has
to be some explanation.

01:08:59.644 --> 01:09:02.109
I think I know what it is.

01:09:02.112 --> 01:09:03.345
What?

01:09:03.348 --> 01:09:04.779
The cottage.

01:09:04.782 --> 01:09:05.913
It has to be, right?

01:09:05.916 --> 01:09:07.049
The cottage?

01:09:07.051 --> 01:09:08.551
Yeah, it's
enchanted, remember?

01:09:08.553 --> 01:09:10.386
Oh come on, you don't
believe that the cottage

01:09:10.388 --> 01:09:11.886
is actually enchanted, do you?

01:09:11.889 --> 01:09:13.388
No, think about it.

01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:15.424
All of the happy couples
who've been through here.

01:09:15.426 --> 01:09:17.060
It has to be connected
to that in some way.

01:09:17.062 --> 01:09:19.560
- Don't you think?
- No.

01:09:19.563 --> 01:09:21.665
Okay maybe, I don't know.

01:09:23.234 --> 01:09:24.734
Maybe there's
something in the book.

01:09:24.736 --> 01:09:26.502
The one that I showed you
when you first visited.

01:09:26.504 --> 01:09:27.868
You know what?

01:09:27.871 --> 01:09:30.374
Right now, I don't wanna know.

01:10:03.875 --> 01:10:06.942
Of course Laura,
is everything okay?

01:10:06.944 --> 01:10:08.013
Yes, maybe.

01:10:09.179 --> 01:10:10.545
I'm not sure.

01:10:10.547 --> 01:10:12.281
Your phone call
had me worried.

01:10:12.283 --> 01:10:14.284
What's going on?

01:10:14.286 --> 01:10:16.621
Wait, something's different.

01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:20.722
Did you do something
to the room?

01:10:20.724 --> 01:10:21.558
No.

01:10:22.493 --> 01:10:23.593
Hmm.

01:10:23.595 --> 01:10:25.695
Something's different.

01:10:25.697 --> 01:10:29.868
I don't think you'll be
able to guess this Major.

01:10:31.670 --> 01:10:33.402
You're here.

01:10:33.404 --> 01:10:35.637
Are you two gonna
keep me in suspense?

01:10:35.639 --> 01:10:38.674
What is it that you couldn't
tell me on the telephone?

01:10:38.676 --> 01:10:40.176
You might wanna sit down.

01:10:40.178 --> 01:10:42.011
Alright, now I'm
really concerned.

01:10:43.648 --> 01:10:44.681
We need some advice.

01:10:44.683 --> 01:10:45.517
Advice?

01:10:47.218 --> 01:10:48.484
I'm not sure how to say this.

01:10:48.486 --> 01:10:50.285
You're never going
to believe us.

01:10:50.287 --> 01:10:51.121
What?

01:10:52.556 --> 01:10:53.556
I'm beautiful.

01:10:53.558 --> 01:10:54.524
It's true, she is.

01:10:54.526 --> 01:10:56.859
She's absolutely beautiful.

01:10:56.861 --> 01:10:58.363
Beautiful, okay.

01:10:59.831 --> 01:11:01.399
I don't understand.

01:11:08.939 --> 01:11:10.207
Feel my face.

01:11:11.675 --> 01:11:13.142
Feel that?

01:11:13.144 --> 01:11:15.378
My scars are gone.

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:18.114
How could this have happened?

01:11:18.116 --> 01:11:19.248
I don't know.

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:21.417
I'm not sure I
understand everything.

01:11:21.419 --> 01:11:24.320
It's starting
to scare me Major.

01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:25.922
Why?

01:11:25.924 --> 01:11:29.758
Well, I know what I'm
about to say sounds crazy,

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:32.928
but Laura thinks
that we're under a,

01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:34.563
I don't know any
other way to say it,

01:11:34.565 --> 01:11:37.033
but some sort of
spell or enchantment

01:11:37.035 --> 01:11:41.270
and that somehow the cottage
is what allowed it to happen.

01:11:41.272 --> 01:11:43.138
What's the cottage
got to do with this?

01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:44.539
Well you just felt it.

01:11:44.541 --> 01:11:46.642
You said there was
something about the cottage,

01:11:46.644 --> 01:11:48.578
that there was something
different about it.

01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:50.946
Yes, well I'm not
sure that's what I meant

01:11:50.948 --> 01:11:53.015
when I said that.

01:11:53.017 --> 01:11:55.685
Let's take a deep breath.

01:11:55.687 --> 01:11:58.022
When did this change happen?

01:11:59.323 --> 01:12:00.589
Shortly after the wedding.

01:12:00.591 --> 01:12:03.025
Almost as soon as we
entered the cottage.

01:12:03.027 --> 01:12:05.460
Yeah, it was
right after dinner.

01:12:05.462 --> 01:12:06.829
It was a gradual change.

01:12:06.831 --> 01:12:08.897
It didn't happen all at once.

01:12:08.899 --> 01:12:10.266
I just remember
looking at Laura

01:12:10.268 --> 01:12:12.337
and she was so beautiful.

01:12:13.404 --> 01:12:15.303
And Oliver's
change was different.

01:12:15.305 --> 01:12:19.709
His scars seemed to go away
a little bit at a time.

01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:20.877
I have to admit, this is,

01:12:20.879 --> 01:12:22.244
it's hard to understand.

01:12:22.246 --> 01:12:23.914
But isn't this good?

01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:27.883
Yes.

01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:29.352
So what's the problem?

01:12:29.354 --> 01:12:30.786
Well Laura has it in her head

01:12:30.788 --> 01:12:33.990
that if it is some
sort of enchantment,

01:12:33.992 --> 01:12:36.092
I can't believe I'm
saying this but,

01:12:36.094 --> 01:12:39.561
well then if it is, if
we leave the cottage

01:12:39.563 --> 01:12:42.999
it will go away and we'll go
back to the way that we were.

01:12:43.001 --> 01:12:45.668
That's why we
wanted to talk to you.

01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:48.070
We thought you might
be able to explain it.

01:12:48.072 --> 01:12:49.571
Because we can't.

01:12:49.573 --> 01:12:53.241
And I mean right, there has to
be some sort of explanation?

01:12:53.243 --> 01:12:57.780
Well you know I've
prayed for miracles myself.

01:12:57.782 --> 01:13:02.017
I have a faith that if you
believe and if you pray,

01:13:02.019 --> 01:13:03.552
anything can happen.

01:13:03.554 --> 01:13:07.789
But if I were you, I would
spend less time asking why

01:13:07.791 --> 01:13:09.025
and more time enjoying

01:13:09.027 --> 01:13:12.561
this incredible gift
you've been given.

01:13:12.563 --> 01:13:14.496
As for how long
it's going to last,

01:13:14.498 --> 01:13:18.133
well that's one of
life's surprising things.

01:13:18.135 --> 01:13:21.637
You never know anything
until you know.

01:13:21.639 --> 01:13:23.308
So just be thankful.

01:13:24.442 --> 01:13:26.676
You've been given a
gift that no one I know

01:13:26.678 --> 01:13:28.677
has ever been given.

01:13:28.679 --> 01:13:29.712
I am thankful.

01:13:29.714 --> 01:13:31.446
We both are.

01:13:31.448 --> 01:13:33.516
Well a miracle has certainly
happened here tonight,

01:13:33.518 --> 01:13:35.383
one way or another.

01:13:35.385 --> 01:13:39.588
You've given me something quite
remarkable to think about.

01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:41.990
I don't think I'm
gonna sleep tonight.

01:13:41.992 --> 01:13:46.361
It's not often you get to
ponder real life miracles.

01:13:46.363 --> 01:13:48.897
I'm gonna leave you two here.

01:13:48.899 --> 01:13:53.235
The last thing you need is me
here during your honeymoon.

01:13:53.237 --> 01:13:55.103
Come on Major.

01:13:55.105 --> 01:13:56.438
Thanks Major, goodnight.

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.442
Goodnight.

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.033
So, do you believe his theory?

01:14:24.035 --> 01:14:26.002
A heaven sent miracle?

01:14:26.004 --> 01:14:28.404
I don't know, do you?

01:14:28.406 --> 01:14:30.205
I don't know what to believe.

01:14:30.207 --> 01:14:31.209
Me either.

01:14:32.644 --> 01:14:35.043
Was it something you
wanna keep a secret?

01:14:35.045 --> 01:14:37.445
I don't know that we
could even if we wanted to.

01:14:37.447 --> 01:14:41.083
Sooner or later
everyone's gonna find out.

01:14:41.085 --> 01:14:42.584
I'd like to tell
my father first.

01:14:42.586 --> 01:14:43.819
Sure.

01:14:43.821 --> 01:14:45.387
We'll see if he can
come over tomorrow.

01:14:45.389 --> 01:14:47.690
Have the Major
talk to him first.

01:14:47.692 --> 01:14:48.526
Okay.

01:14:49.961 --> 01:14:53.731
Well, 'til then, goodnight
James and Kate Winslow.

01:14:54.765 --> 01:14:56.298
Goodnight Jack and Rose.

01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:57.365
It doesn't say that.

01:14:57.367 --> 01:14:58.834
Don't let go Jack.

01:14:58.836 --> 01:15:00.369
Don't ever let go.

01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:01.404
You're so cold.

01:15:01.406 --> 01:15:02.239
Stop.

01:15:03.875 --> 01:15:06.709
Goodnight Oliver
and Laura Bradshaw.

01:15:06.711 --> 01:15:08.444
They are my favorite couple.

01:15:08.446 --> 01:15:09.346
Mine too.

01:15:16.987 --> 01:15:19.120
I'll race you there.

01:15:29.099 --> 01:15:29.933
Come in.

01:15:41.078 --> 01:15:43.081
Mr. Bradshaw, I presume.

01:15:45.683 --> 01:15:47.383
Hello Major.

01:15:47.385 --> 01:15:50.054
I didn't expect to see you here.

01:15:51.355 --> 01:15:53.556
Oliver called, said he,

01:15:53.558 --> 01:15:56.258
wanted to discuss
a family matter.

01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:59.263
He asked me to
speak to you first.

01:16:00.531 --> 01:16:02.365
What's this about?

01:16:02.367 --> 01:16:03.432
Where is he?

01:16:03.434 --> 01:16:04.900
Oh, he'll be right down.

01:16:04.902 --> 01:16:06.869
He wanted me to prepare you.

01:16:06.871 --> 01:16:08.303
For what?

01:16:08.305 --> 01:16:10.373
Just some good news.

01:16:10.375 --> 01:16:12.644
Do you believe in miracles?

01:16:13.577 --> 01:16:17.379
Miracles.

01:16:17.381 --> 01:16:18.748
Modern miracles.

01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:22.185
Miracles that can
happen to you or to me.

01:16:23.121 --> 01:16:25.120
I can't say that I do.

01:16:25.122 --> 01:16:29.825
Well if you don't, this
is going to be interesting.

01:16:29.827 --> 01:16:33.728
It's what Oliver asked
me to share with you.

01:16:33.730 --> 01:16:36.632
A miracle has happened to them.

01:16:36.634 --> 01:16:38.968
They can't explain it, but
they've both been touched

01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:41.539
by a power beyond what we know.

01:16:42.806 --> 01:16:44.472
They've changed.

01:16:44.474 --> 01:16:45.473
Changed.

01:16:45.475 --> 01:16:47.478
Yes, Oliver is healed.

01:16:48.679 --> 01:16:50.512
His injuries are
completely gone.

01:16:50.514 --> 01:16:54.049
And Laura, I know that
you did not approve

01:16:54.051 --> 01:16:58.387
of his choice of a wife,
but she is as beautiful

01:16:58.389 --> 01:17:00.955
as the deepest
meaning of the word.

01:17:00.957 --> 01:17:04.026
You don't expect
me to believe that.

01:17:04.028 --> 01:17:06.027
I didn't expect
that you would.

01:17:06.029 --> 01:17:10.365
But, I've done what was
requested of me anyway.

01:17:10.367 --> 01:17:13.302
Mr. Bradshaw, if I
may, a bit of advice.

01:17:13.304 --> 01:17:16.438
Your son has come a long
way since he arrived here.

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.874
Give him at least the courtesy

01:17:18.876 --> 01:17:21.410
of a reserved
response on your part.

01:17:21.412 --> 01:17:23.812
I'll keep that in mind.

01:17:23.814 --> 01:17:24.815
Thank you.

01:17:27.684 --> 01:17:29.754
Oliver, Laura, it's time.

01:17:34.058 --> 01:17:35.490
Thanks for coming Dad.

01:17:35.492 --> 01:17:37.993
Son.

01:17:37.995 --> 01:17:39.829
You've met Laura.

01:17:39.831 --> 01:17:42.266
It's nice to see you again.

01:17:44.068 --> 01:17:46.401
How's my son
been treating you?

01:17:46.403 --> 01:17:48.036
He's been wonderful.

01:17:48.038 --> 01:17:49.905
We've been very happy.

01:17:49.907 --> 01:17:51.640
Then marriage suits you.

01:17:51.642 --> 01:17:52.575
Thank you.

01:17:52.577 --> 01:17:54.375
Would you like to have a seat?

01:17:54.377 --> 01:17:55.379
Thank you.

01:18:00.017 --> 01:18:04.018
So, Hillgrove told
me about this change.

01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:06.155
It's amazing, isn't it?

01:18:06.157 --> 01:18:08.356
We didn't know what
to make of it at first.

01:18:08.358 --> 01:18:10.593
It was actually a bit of an
adjustment getting use to it,

01:18:10.595 --> 01:18:12.597
but we've been so happy.

01:18:13.965 --> 01:18:17.665
Dad, I know who I am,
I know what I wanna do.

01:18:17.667 --> 01:18:21.102
And the first thing I
wanna say is I'm sorry.

01:18:21.104 --> 01:18:22.905
I realize I haven't
really been myself lately.

01:18:22.907 --> 01:18:25.141
And I want to
apologize for that.

01:18:25.143 --> 01:18:27.142
You've reminded me
about my commitments

01:18:27.144 --> 01:18:28.143
and I know you've wanted me

01:18:28.145 --> 01:18:29.578
to work with you
for a while now,

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:32.781
and I think I'm
ready to do that.

01:18:32.783 --> 01:18:35.750
Well that's a
pleasant surprise.

01:18:35.752 --> 01:18:38.320
I just have one caveat.

01:18:38.322 --> 01:18:39.588
I appreciate that
you sent the Major

01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:41.457
to come and speak with
me and so long as we can

01:18:41.459 --> 01:18:43.625
dedicate some of our
resources to his work,

01:18:43.627 --> 01:18:45.060
I'd like to come
and work with you

01:18:45.062 --> 01:18:47.663
and keep the family
business together.

01:18:47.665 --> 01:18:49.130
I'd love to help.

01:18:49.132 --> 01:18:50.732
Just let us know
what you need Major.

01:18:50.734 --> 01:18:51.901
Thank you, I will.

01:18:51.903 --> 01:18:53.235
No, it's the least we can do.

01:18:53.237 --> 01:18:56.237
It's great to see that
you're feeling better.

01:18:56.239 --> 01:18:58.941
I guess I owe thanks
to both of you.

01:18:58.943 --> 01:19:00.441
And you too Laura.

01:19:00.443 --> 01:19:02.945
I always told Oliver to get
a woman of good character.

01:19:02.947 --> 01:19:05.181
This is a good change for him.

01:19:05.183 --> 01:19:07.615
He always seemed to have
his on just the pretty ones.

01:19:08.452 --> 01:19:09.384
She's a strong woman.

01:19:09.386 --> 01:19:11.389
You're lucky to have her.

01:19:13.291 --> 01:19:15.891
I'm sorry, but I have to leave.

01:19:15.893 --> 01:19:19.230
It's good to see you
on your feet again.

01:19:20.564 --> 01:19:21.896
When you finish your
recovery, we'll talk some more

01:19:21.898 --> 01:19:22.932
about your plans.

01:19:22.934 --> 01:19:24.133
Recovery?

01:19:24.135 --> 01:19:25.633
Well we don't have
to talk about that now.

01:19:25.635 --> 01:19:27.369
When you're ready, I know
a great plastic surgeon

01:19:27.371 --> 01:19:29.771
that can help you
with your scars.

01:19:29.773 --> 01:19:32.040
I'm so glad you
reached out to me.

01:19:32.042 --> 01:19:36.311
We'll have you back
at 100%, no time.

01:19:36.313 --> 01:19:38.614
Well, I

01:19:38.616 --> 01:19:41.217
I'm sorry I have to
run Laura, Major.

01:19:41.219 --> 01:19:42.351
Good day.

01:19:42.353 --> 01:19:43.187
Yeah.

01:19:54.631 --> 01:19:57.134
I'm, I'm really happy for you.

01:19:59.437 --> 01:20:00.537
Thanks Dad.

01:20:17.354 --> 01:20:18.188
Bye.

01:20:38.408 --> 01:20:40.709
I don't understand, he
said I still have scars.

01:20:40.711 --> 01:20:42.110
And he thought I was.

01:20:42.112 --> 01:20:42.945
This doesn't make sense.

01:20:42.947 --> 01:20:44.681
Can you see anything?

01:20:46.751 --> 01:20:48.217
No.

01:20:48.219 --> 01:20:49.651
Do you see my scars at all?

01:20:49.653 --> 01:20:51.619
No, I can't.

01:20:51.621 --> 01:20:52.954
What about me?

01:20:52.956 --> 01:20:55.892
You still look
just as beautiful.

01:20:58.295 --> 01:21:00.495
This makes no sense.

01:21:00.497 --> 01:21:01.963
Mrs. Minnett!

01:21:01.965 --> 01:21:03.731
I'm sorry.

01:21:03.733 --> 01:21:05.700
I wanted to protect
you from this.

01:21:05.702 --> 01:21:06.535
From what?

01:21:06.537 --> 01:21:08.003
I don't understand.

01:21:08.005 --> 01:21:10.507
We haven't changed, have we?

01:21:11.341 --> 01:21:13.609
Did you always know?

01:21:13.611 --> 01:21:15.076
Yes.

01:21:15.078 --> 01:21:15.912
I have.

01:21:20.318 --> 01:21:21.850
Mrs. Minnett.

01:21:21.852 --> 01:21:24.552
Please tell me the truth.

01:21:24.554 --> 01:21:27.157
Can you see my scars, my burns.

01:21:28.291 --> 01:21:31.560
Or what about Laura,
does she look different?

01:21:31.562 --> 01:21:34.398
Has her appearance
changed at all?

01:21:37.001 --> 01:21:37.835
No.

01:21:39.670 --> 01:21:40.936
Mrs. Minnett, look at us.

01:21:40.938 --> 01:21:43.607
There's no change
in our appearance?

01:21:45.475 --> 01:21:46.309
None.

01:21:51.415 --> 01:21:53.149
Why are you so upset?

01:21:54.385 --> 01:21:58.456
Just because I can't see
it or your father can't?

01:22:00.056 --> 01:22:02.490
Do you wanna know the secret?

01:22:02.492 --> 01:22:06.395
The enchantment that
this cottage holds.

01:22:06.397 --> 01:22:08.064
You love each other.

01:22:09.567 --> 01:22:11.402
You've fallen in love.

01:22:12.803 --> 01:22:16.905
And a man and woman in
love have a gift of sight

01:22:16.907 --> 01:22:19.741
that isn't granted
to other people.

01:22:19.743 --> 01:22:21.578
Keep your love strong.

01:22:22.645 --> 01:22:23.980
Keep it burning.

01:22:25.349 --> 01:22:29.420
And I promise you, you'll never
be anything to one another

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.989
but handsome and beautiful.

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:38.526
Mrs. Minnett,
care to walk me out?

01:22:38.528 --> 01:22:40.029
I would love to.

01:22:40.031 --> 01:22:41.532
Thank you Major.

01:22:44.434 --> 01:22:45.935
Thank you Major.

01:22:58.381 --> 01:22:59.215
Laura.

01:23:00.518 --> 01:23:02.151
Look at me.

01:23:02.153 --> 01:23:06.090
No matter what happens,
I will always love you.

01:23:07.457 --> 01:23:10.025
You're the most beautiful
woman in the world.

01:23:10.027 --> 01:23:11.295
Inside and out.

01:23:13.296 --> 01:23:17.300
I love you Oliver, I
always have, always will.

01:23:20.004 --> 01:23:21.904
You know, we never
got to write our name

01:23:21.906 --> 01:23:24.772
on the windows with
the other couples.

01:23:24.774 --> 01:23:28.477
Well I guess it's
about time we did.

01:23:28.479 --> 01:23:30.548
After you, Mrs. Bradshaw.

01:24:23.157 --> 01:24:33.157
