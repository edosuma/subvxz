[reporter]: It's
officially Christmas time

00:38.734 --> 00:40.040
here at
the Radcliffe Center,

00:40.083 --> 00:41.911
and all of Chicago
is gathered

00:41.954 --> 00:42.912
to watch the lighting

00:42.955 --> 00:44.392
of the Radcliffe
Christmas tree,

00:44.435 --> 00:46.002
and here with us,

00:46.046 --> 00:48.874
we have Chicago's
very own "Miss Christmas."

00:48.918 --> 00:50.963
You can call me Holly.

00:51.007 --> 00:51.921
Oh, Holly,
and you are the one to thank

00:51.964 --> 00:53.357
for that stunning tree.

00:53.401 --> 00:56.099
We are only moments away
now from the lighting,

00:56.143 --> 00:58.101
and Holly is
the creative director

00:58.145 --> 00:59.494
for the Radcliffe Center,

00:59.537 --> 01:01.800
and each year,
she finds, transports,

01:01.844 --> 01:03.019
and facilitates

01:03.063 --> 01:05.674
decorating Chicago's
Christmas tree.

01:05.717 --> 01:07.110
It's a dream job come true.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.981
[crowd]: Nine, eight, seven,

01:09.025 --> 01:10.461
six, five...

01:10.505 --> 01:12.115
Here we go!

01:12.159 --> 01:14.204
[crowd]:
Three, two, one!

01:14.248 --> 01:15.814
[cheering]

01:23.561 --> 01:25.389
[reporter]:
Isn't that beautiful?

01:25.433 --> 01:28.131
Chicago's symbol of Christmas.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.002
[over TV recording]:
I have no doubt

01:30.046 --> 01:33.528
that next year's tree will be
bigger and better than ever.

01:33.571 --> 01:34.920
No pressure.

01:34.964 --> 01:37.314
I can't believe a
year's gone by already.

01:37.358 --> 01:38.881
For once in my life,

01:38.924 --> 01:40.056
I thought I made it
to the office before you.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.492
There's always tomorrow.

01:41.536 --> 01:43.712
Thanks. You're a lifesaver.

01:43.755 --> 01:45.627
Today is definitely
a coffee kind of day.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.019
I did not get
any sleep last night,

01:47.063 --> 01:47.933
and I have a million
things to do.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.239
Is one of those things

01:49.283 --> 01:50.806
watching last year's
tree ceremony

01:50.849 --> 01:52.242
for the hundredth time?

01:52.286 --> 01:54.244
You know how happy
it makes me,

01:54.288 --> 01:56.246
and right now, I need
all the reassurance I can get.

01:56.290 --> 01:57.639
Holly, relax.

01:57.682 --> 02:00.772
I just spoke with transport,
and all is good.

02:00.816 --> 02:03.079
They've secured the trunk.
They're about ready to cut.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.124
The tree will be here
by tonight.

02:04.167 --> 02:05.125
Yeah, fingers crossed.

02:05.168 --> 02:05.908
[phone rings]

02:05.951 --> 02:07.518
Hello?

02:07.562 --> 02:09.651
Okay, yeah, yeah,
I'll be right there.

02:13.437 --> 02:14.699
I still think
I should've gone out there.

02:14.743 --> 02:15.744
I always go...

02:15.787 --> 02:17.093
And run yourself ragged,

02:17.137 --> 02:18.138
and micro-manage
everything,

02:18.181 --> 02:19.574
and end up exhausted

02:19.617 --> 02:21.053
and unable to enjoy
the tree lighting ceremony.

02:21.097 --> 02:22.359
Yeah.

02:22.403 --> 02:23.839
That's my Christmas
tradition.

02:23.882 --> 02:26.363
Why don't we find
a new tradition this year?

02:26.407 --> 02:28.409
Like what?

02:28.452 --> 02:30.193
Like getting
out of our comfort zone,

02:30.237 --> 02:31.673
back on the market?

02:31.716 --> 02:33.153
I got us two tickets

02:33.196 --> 02:34.676
to a speed dating event.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.373
[squeals]

02:36.417 --> 02:37.635
Do you have anything else
to wear, though?

02:37.679 --> 02:38.941
'Cause it looks

02:38.984 --> 02:40.682
like Mrs. Claus
chose your outfit again.

02:40.725 --> 02:42.118
I think you should be
a little nicer

02:42.162 --> 02:43.946
to someone who brings you coffee
every morning

02:43.989 --> 02:45.208
and who is your boss...

02:47.210 --> 02:49.908
and I appreciate you
thinking of me, but no.

02:49.952 --> 02:52.215
Look, I have to be here
for when the tree arrives,

02:52.259 --> 02:53.651
and I've so much to do.

02:53.695 --> 02:55.305
All you do is work.

02:55.349 --> 02:56.350
That's not true.

02:56.393 --> 02:57.525
I do other things.

02:57.568 --> 02:58.743
Yeah?

02:58.787 --> 03:01.181
-Like what?
-Like...

03:01.224 --> 03:02.312
like Christmas!

03:02.356 --> 03:03.661
-Oh.
-Okay?

03:03.705 --> 03:05.010
And after the Radcliffe
tree arrives,

03:05.054 --> 03:06.664
I'm going to go home
and decorate my tree.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.449
There's 24 more days
until Christmas.

03:08.492 --> 03:09.841
I know,
and I'm running out of time.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.669
Listen, Erin,

03:11.713 --> 03:13.018
I appreciate
your ongoing meddling

03:13.062 --> 03:14.063
into my personal life,

03:14.106 --> 03:15.673
but I'm a little
busy right now,

03:15.717 --> 03:17.762
orchestrating
cutting down...

03:17.806 --> 03:19.242
[both]:
A 95-foot-tall spruce

03:19.286 --> 03:20.417
and getting it trucked
across the state.

03:20.461 --> 03:21.636
-Really?
-I'm sorry.

03:21.679 --> 03:23.246
I just...

03:23.290 --> 03:24.813
I want to see you
spend the holidays with someone.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.293
And I want that too.

03:26.336 --> 03:27.816
It's just...

03:27.859 --> 03:29.165
I'm busy right now,

03:29.209 --> 03:30.688
and I'm trying
to focus on my career.

03:30.732 --> 03:31.907
Dating takes time,

03:31.950 --> 03:34.039
and it's really
distracting.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.172
I just want to get my career
to where it needs to be,

03:36.216 --> 03:37.391
and then...

03:37.434 --> 03:38.392
you know...

03:38.435 --> 03:39.871
we'll see.

03:39.915 --> 03:42.265
Wouldn't it be nice
to bring a date

03:42.309 --> 03:43.832
to the tree lighting
ceremony?

03:43.875 --> 03:46.182
I just want there
to be a tree lighting ceremony.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.532
Everything is on schedule.
What could possibly go wrong?

03:48.576 --> 03:50.578
[woman]:
Holly!

03:54.364 --> 03:55.974
Um...

03:57.802 --> 03:58.716
Did you see this?

03:58.760 --> 03:59.804
Oh...

03:59.848 --> 04:01.371
Uh...

04:01.415 --> 04:03.808
[gasps]
What happened?

04:03.852 --> 04:06.333
It looks
like the crane swiped it,

04:06.376 --> 04:07.725
breaking off the branches...

04:07.769 --> 04:10.075
Rendering it unusable.
It's ruined.

04:10.119 --> 04:12.295
No, it's not
ruined. It's...

04:14.210 --> 04:16.343
Okay, it's ruined.
Um...

04:16.386 --> 04:17.779
but it's going
to be fine.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.041
We can fix this.

04:19.084 --> 04:20.129
How?

04:20.172 --> 04:21.130
I...

04:23.132 --> 04:24.742
I'm going to find
another tree.

04:24.786 --> 04:26.266
Find another...?

04:26.309 --> 04:28.833
You just spent all year
finding this tree.

04:28.877 --> 04:30.531
How are you going
to find another tree

04:30.574 --> 04:32.489
and get it here
and get it decorated

04:32.533 --> 04:33.664
in time for the
tree-lighting ceremony

04:33.708 --> 04:36.101
in 10 days?

04:36.145 --> 04:37.755
Thank you, Andrea.

04:37.799 --> 04:39.496
That's very helpful.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.457
[whispering to self]
Okay, focus, Holly.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.328
You are Miss Christmas.

04:45.372 --> 04:46.634
[normal voice]
I am Miss Christmas.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.244
This is what I do,

04:48.288 --> 04:50.768
and I am going
to figure this out.

04:52.901 --> 04:54.294
Apparently, yes. Yeah.

05:15.489 --> 05:18.622
You know, maybe
this is a good thing.

05:18.666 --> 05:22.974
Yeah, that tree was beautiful,
but it never felt right.

05:23.018 --> 05:26.804
It never felt like "the" tree.

05:26.848 --> 05:28.371
Maybe this happened
for a reason.

05:28.415 --> 05:31.722
Are you actually finding
the silver lining?

05:31.766 --> 05:33.463
My dad always said,

05:33.507 --> 05:35.596
"When things go wrong,
don't go with them."

05:35.639 --> 05:37.511
I know the perfect
tree is out there,

05:37.554 --> 05:39.034
and I'm going to find it.

05:39.077 --> 05:40.252
Clear my schedule.

05:40.296 --> 05:41.384
But what about
the speed dating?

05:41.428 --> 05:43.908
Maybe you can find
your perfect man.

05:43.952 --> 05:45.519
The only thing that's harder

05:45.562 --> 05:46.781
than finding
the perfect Christmas tree

05:46.824 --> 05:49.566
is finding the perfect man,

05:49.610 --> 05:51.873
but at least the perfect tree
really does exist.

05:57.531 --> 05:58.880
[Erin]:
We have spent hours

05:58.923 --> 05:59.968
looking for a new tree!

06:00.011 --> 06:01.883
[Holly]:
How about these?

06:03.363 --> 06:04.407
You've looked through those
already.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.366
What haven't I looked through?

06:06.409 --> 06:07.584
You've looked
through everything.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.414
There has to be something.

06:13.547 --> 06:14.809
[gasps]

06:14.852 --> 06:16.158
What about
the tree submissions

06:16.201 --> 06:17.464
we got in the mail?

06:17.507 --> 06:18.682
They've been coming
in all year.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.036
Oh.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.821
Yeah. Guess I'm not going
speed dating tonight.

06:26.864 --> 06:29.040
No, no, no. You go.
I got this.

06:29.084 --> 06:30.302
Are you sure?

06:30.346 --> 06:32.043
Yeah. Definitely, yes.

06:32.087 --> 06:34.437
Definitely, yeah.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.526
Well, it is
the season of miracles.

06:42.227 --> 06:43.707
Hey, come on!

06:43.751 --> 06:45.709
Yay, we're home.

06:49.104 --> 06:51.454
Oh, Rudy, I forgot to tell you.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.891
So your daycare mommy
told me

06:53.935 --> 06:56.938
not only were you
the best-behaved dog today...

06:58.243 --> 07:01.464
you were also
the best-looking dog...

07:01.508 --> 07:02.987
but we kind of already
knew that, didn't we?

07:03.031 --> 07:04.685
Told you
that bow looks good on you.

07:04.728 --> 07:05.947
[barks]

07:35.106 --> 07:36.368
Perfect.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.784
[Rudy whimpers]

08:00.828 --> 08:02.873
My sentiments exactly.

08:04.614 --> 08:07.225
[phone rings
with "Jingle Bells" ringtone]

08:07.269 --> 08:08.836
Hey.

08:08.879 --> 08:10.533
[Erin]: Hey! I figured
you'd be home by now.

08:10.577 --> 08:11.969
Just wanted to check

08:12.013 --> 08:12.796
and see what you got
so far.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.276
Uh...

08:14.319 --> 08:15.712
apple trees,

08:15.756 --> 08:17.453
potted plants,

08:17.497 --> 08:19.063
cacti,

08:19.107 --> 08:21.326
and a Popsicle-stick tree.

08:21.370 --> 08:22.327
Oh.

08:22.371 --> 08:23.720
Yeah.

08:23.764 --> 08:24.678
You ready to give up?

08:25.983 --> 08:27.245
Never.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.337
[sighing]

08:33.381 --> 08:35.035
Okay.

08:35.078 --> 08:36.994
Now I'm ready to give up.

09:02.411 --> 09:05.588
[child]: "Dear Miss Christmas,
I saw you on TV.

09:05.632 --> 09:07.764
You're the lady
who chooses the Christmas tree.

09:07.808 --> 09:12.116
I'm writing to you to tell you
that I've found your next tree.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.683
Please come to Klaus, Wisconsin
to pick it up.

09:13.727 --> 09:17.078
Sincerely, Joey McNary, age 8."

09:26.957 --> 09:28.480
Oh...

09:32.746 --> 09:33.616
[barks]

09:35.966 --> 09:37.664
[knocking]

09:37.707 --> 09:40.144
[continued knocking]

09:40.188 --> 09:41.145
Coming...

09:42.669 --> 09:43.626
[Holly]:
I found it.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.236
I found it!

09:45.280 --> 09:46.194
It's "the" tree.

09:46.237 --> 09:48.588
I have to go to Klaus.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.024
To Santa Claus?

09:50.067 --> 09:52.679
Okay, you are officially
Christmas crazy.

09:52.722 --> 09:53.941
No, no!

09:53.984 --> 09:55.899
Klaus, Wisconsin.

09:55.943 --> 09:58.162
You know, that town that does
the big Christmas festival.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.555
No.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.730
It's a big holiday
destination spot.

10:00.774 --> 10:03.690
They decorate the whole town.

10:03.733 --> 10:06.214
They have Christmas
events and caroling

10:06.257 --> 10:07.258
and... everything, okay?

10:07.302 --> 10:09.347
My dad took me once as a kid,

10:09.391 --> 10:11.349
and now...

10:11.393 --> 10:14.439
the tree is there!

10:14.483 --> 10:16.006
Yes!

10:16.050 --> 10:17.094
Yes, this really is perfect.

10:17.138 --> 10:19.096
It is!
It's "the" tree!

10:19.140 --> 10:19.967
Oh, hey, can you
take Rudy for me

10:20.010 --> 10:20.924
while I'm gone?

10:20.968 --> 10:22.273
Sure...

10:22.317 --> 10:24.667
but Holly,
there's no return address.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.147
How are you going
to find these people?

10:26.190 --> 10:29.629

It's a winter wonderland.

these scouting trips

16:07.488 --> 16:09.316

to being the perfect height

16:09.359 --> 16:11.448
and shape and color,

16:11.492 --> 16:14.147
the tree has to have
that X factor,

16:14.190 --> 16:16.105
that star quality.

give you the tree is.

for sale.

that all of Chicago

19:26.165 --> 19:30.299
So I just have to...
open his heart to the idea.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.432
There you go!
That's the Holly I know!

19:32.475 --> 19:33.476
Yeah.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.348
Okay.

19:35.391 --> 19:36.914
I'll call you
when I have the tree.

19:53.148 --> 19:54.193
Sam.

19:54.236 --> 19:55.933
Yeah?

19:55.977 --> 19:57.979
I apologize.
I got ahead of myself,

19:58.022 --> 20:00.242
and I'm not even sure
that this is the tree,

20:00.286 --> 20:02.157
but I came
all this way,

20:02.201 --> 20:03.898
and I'd just like to see it.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.726
There's no harm in
showing it to her.

20:05.769 --> 20:06.857
Uh-- Uh--

20:08.685 --> 20:09.643
You're going
to muck up your boots.

20:09.686 --> 20:10.557
I mean, it's way back there.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.298
Oh.

20:12.341 --> 20:14.300
First rule
of growing up on a farm...

20:14.343 --> 20:15.388
always have sensible shoes.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.397
Wow!

20:24.440 --> 20:27.138
Oh, wow!
It's beautiful!

20:29.619 --> 20:31.273
Oh, it's gorgeous!

20:32.970 --> 20:34.494
It's the perfect height.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.887
The perfect height
for what?

20:36.931 --> 20:39.238
It's tall enough to stand
against the skyscrapers,

20:39.281 --> 20:41.327
but short enough to be trucked
through the city.

20:41.370 --> 20:42.371
Wow.

20:45.374 --> 20:48.682
It's absolutely perfect.

20:48.725 --> 20:49.683
I know.

20:49.726 --> 20:51.293
You know,

20:51.337 --> 20:52.381
I've been around trees
my whole life,

20:52.425 --> 20:55.645
and I haven't seen many
like this.

20:55.689 --> 20:57.908
It's... truly special.

20:59.475 --> 21:00.694
It's right.

21:00.737 --> 21:02.173
Yup.
Right here.

21:04.175 --> 21:05.394
Sam, if you were to say yes,

21:05.438 --> 21:07.309
your whole family
would get to go to Chicago

21:07.353 --> 21:09.180
on an all-expenses paid trip,

21:09.224 --> 21:11.226
and you guys
would be front and center

21:11.270 --> 21:12.923
as V.I.P.s
at the tree lighting ceremony.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.229
[laughs]

21:14.273 --> 21:16.492
I don't care
about being a V.I.P...

21:18.277 --> 21:20.975
but here's something
I do care about.

21:25.414 --> 21:28.852
39 years ago,

21:28.896 --> 21:32.465
my mom Leslie
and my dad George

21:32.508 --> 21:34.858
bought this land
and carved that there.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.993
All they had was a
mortgage and a dream,

21:39.036 --> 21:42.344
but this tree represented

21:42.388 --> 21:44.346
everything
that they would watch grow.

21:44.390 --> 21:45.869
That's beautiful.

21:47.480 --> 21:50.352
Don't you want to share
that story with the world?

21:50.396 --> 21:54.182
Put their love on display
for everyone to admire?

21:54.225 --> 21:55.575
No.

21:55.618 --> 21:56.489
I want to keep it
with my family,

21:56.532 --> 21:57.533
where it belongs.

21:57.577 --> 21:58.621
And what about Joey?

21:58.665 --> 22:00.101
It would mean so much to him.

22:00.144 --> 22:02.364
Well, it would now,
because he's eight,

22:02.408 --> 22:04.888
but trust me, 20 years from now,
when this tree's still standing,

22:04.932 --> 22:06.281
it'll mean a lot more to him

22:06.325 --> 22:08.805
than him seeing it
with some skyscrapers.

22:09.937 --> 22:11.373
Hm.

22:11.417 --> 22:12.418
Listen, Holly,
I admire your tenacity,

22:12.461 --> 22:13.549
but...

22:13.593 --> 22:15.856
I mean,
the answer is just no.

22:24.908 --> 22:26.388
Oh, there's...
there's Aimee there.

22:26.432 --> 22:27.389
Okay.

22:27.433 --> 22:29.260
I have to...

22:29.304 --> 22:30.349
Sorry again.

22:34.962 --> 22:37.094
I really didn't want you
to be disappointed.

22:37.138 --> 22:38.400
No, I understand.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.837
It's your parents' tree.

22:40.881 --> 22:42.796
I just think that donating it

22:42.839 --> 22:45.407
could be special
for your family.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.888
I mean,
there's something so moving

22:47.931 --> 22:49.759
about bringing joy
to so many people.

22:53.110 --> 22:54.024
What's wrong?

22:55.461 --> 22:57.680
I thought Sam had told you.

22:57.724 --> 22:59.378
Told me what?

23:00.857 --> 23:03.033
Our mom passed away
last year.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.252
Oh...

23:06.123 --> 23:08.256
I'm really sorry to hear that.

23:08.299 --> 23:10.737
That's why Sam doesn't want
to give away this tree.

23:21.443 --> 23:22.662
Okay.
I got it.

23:22.705 --> 23:24.881
I, uh, I'm going
to be on my way.

23:27.797 --> 23:30.234
Hey, Dad,
dinner's almost ready!

23:30.278 --> 23:32.411
All right, Joey,
I'll be right in.

23:37.764 --> 23:39.287
Miss Christmas!

23:42.072 --> 23:43.683
I saw you on TV,

23:43.726 --> 23:44.553
and I wrote to you,
and you came!

23:44.597 --> 23:46.599
You came for our tree!

23:46.642 --> 23:47.817
I have to tell Grandpa!

23:47.861 --> 23:50.429
He didn't think she'd come!

23:50.472 --> 23:52.474
Wait,
Grandpa knew about the letter?

23:57.610 --> 23:58.567
Come meet Grandpa!

23:58.611 --> 23:59.655
Okay.

24:00.656 --> 24:01.701
[Aimee]: Hey, Dad.

24:01.744 --> 24:03.746
[Joey]: Hi, Grandpa!

24:03.790 --> 24:06.836
[Aimee]: Whoa,
cooking up a storm in here.

24:09.230 --> 24:12.015
[Joey]: Smells good.

24:15.976 --> 24:17.368
Come on.

24:17.412 --> 24:19.414
[Aimee]: Let's eat!

24:19.458 --> 24:22.504
Grandpa, look who it is!
Miss Christmas came!

24:22.548 --> 24:23.462
[Holly]: Hi.
Nice to meet you.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.637
[George]:
Welcome!

24:24.680 --> 24:25.638
It's an enigma!

24:25.681 --> 24:27.074
[all chuckling]

24:27.117 --> 24:28.728
Grandpa just taught me
the word enigma.

24:28.771 --> 24:29.816
[George]:
Well, I'm not sure

24:29.859 --> 24:31.208
it's an enigma exactly,

24:31.252 --> 24:33.950
but it sure is exciting!

24:33.994 --> 24:35.212
And you're right on time
for dinner.

24:35.256 --> 24:37.214
Can you stay?

24:37.258 --> 24:38.433
[Aimee]:
What do you think?

24:38.477 --> 24:40.174
I should get going.

24:40.217 --> 24:43.307
No, it's dinner time,
and you've come all this way.

24:43.351 --> 24:44.744
Let us feed you.

24:44.787 --> 24:46.310
I made
grilled cheese sandwiches.

24:46.354 --> 24:47.834
Kind of.

24:47.877 --> 24:49.096
Thanks, pal.

24:49.139 --> 24:51.577
[Joey]: We made
pumpkin pie as well.

24:51.620 --> 24:52.795
Please stay.

24:53.927 --> 24:54.841
Yeah, stay.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.498
Okay.

24:59.541 --> 25:00.890
-All right!
-[Joey]: Yes!

25:00.934 --> 25:03.327
[George laughs]
Okay!

25:06.243 --> 25:07.897
Looks so good...

25:09.638 --> 25:10.683
Try the milk!

25:10.726 --> 25:12.293
It's from our cows!

25:12.336 --> 25:13.599
It's udderly delicious.

25:13.642 --> 25:15.122
[they laugh, groan]

25:15.165 --> 25:17.733
Oh, come on,
stop being so moo-dy.

25:17.777 --> 25:18.952
Seriously?

25:18.995 --> 25:20.388
Well, I find it a-moo-sing.

25:20.431 --> 25:22.085
[they laugh]

25:23.609 --> 25:24.914
So, Miss Christmas...

25:24.958 --> 25:26.437
Oh, it's actually Holly.

25:26.481 --> 25:28.831
[Joey]: Wait, Miss Christmas
isn't your real name?

25:28.875 --> 25:30.354
Why do they
call you that?

25:30.398 --> 25:32.313
Well, it's a nickname
my dad gave me.

25:32.356 --> 25:33.880
I grew up
on a Christmas tree farm,

25:33.923 --> 25:36.099
and I was always
Christmas crazy,

25:36.143 --> 25:38.449
and I said "Miss Christmas" once
on air,

25:38.493 --> 25:41.409
and it just stuck,

25:41.452 --> 25:42.715
but my real name's Holly.

25:42.758 --> 25:45.282
So, Holly,

25:45.326 --> 25:47.023
you've come
for Leslie's tree.

25:47.067 --> 25:48.459
Oh, no, yeah...

25:48.503 --> 25:49.591
I already told her no.

25:49.635 --> 25:50.592
What?
Dad!

25:50.636 --> 25:52.333
You can't say no!

25:52.376 --> 25:54.248
Grandma loved
the tree lighting!

25:54.291 --> 25:55.597
Yeah, it's true.
She did.

25:55.641 --> 25:57.294
Before the kids,

25:57.338 --> 25:58.687
Leslie and I used to go
to Chicago every year

25:58.731 --> 26:00.559
to see the tree.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.604
Yeah, and Grandma and me
watched it every year on TV.

26:02.648 --> 26:04.258
[Sam]: No, listen, Joey...

26:04.301 --> 26:06.086
I never heard Grandma say

26:06.129 --> 26:08.392
that she wanted to give away
her tree,

26:08.436 --> 26:10.612
and if she wanted
to donate it,

26:10.656 --> 26:12.527
well, then,
why didn't she?

26:12.571 --> 26:15.225
I know you really
want to see the tree on TV,

26:15.269 --> 26:17.967
but...
what about after Christmas?

26:18.011 --> 26:18.925
What then?

26:18.968 --> 26:20.448
Um...

26:20.491 --> 26:22.668
it'll actually be milled
into two-by-fours

26:22.711 --> 26:24.800
to provide lumber
to build houses

26:24.844 --> 26:26.759
for veterans
returning from overseas.

26:26.802 --> 26:28.587
So even after
the holidays,

26:28.630 --> 26:31.459
Leslie's tree will continue
to bring joy to people.

26:31.502 --> 26:32.503
[Sam]:
I meant...

26:32.547 --> 26:33.853
"then what" for us?

26:33.896 --> 26:35.376
Oh.

26:35.419 --> 26:36.420
[Sam]: Because then
we no longer have a tree.

26:36.464 --> 26:37.421
Right.

26:37.465 --> 26:39.554
Sam...

26:39.598 --> 26:40.642
I know you don't want
to give the tree away...

26:40.686 --> 26:42.165
Of course not.

26:42.209 --> 26:43.602
But it's not just yours
to give.

26:46.735 --> 26:48.694
Uh...

26:48.737 --> 26:50.173
I don't want
to cause any problems, so...

26:50.217 --> 26:51.261
It's no problems.

26:51.305 --> 26:53.046
The tree belongs to the family.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.177
It's a family decision.

26:56.223 --> 26:57.659
So, I tell you
what, Holly...

26:57.703 --> 26:59.139
why don't you
make your case,

26:59.182 --> 27:00.923
and then we'll discuss?

27:00.967 --> 27:03.534
Okay.

27:05.319 --> 27:07.451
Right now?

27:07.495 --> 27:08.583
No, we never discuss business
at the table.

27:08.627 --> 27:09.889
Great.

27:09.932 --> 27:11.194
We'll meet tomorrow,
after milking.

27:11.238 --> 27:12.456
Yes!

27:12.500 --> 27:14.502
Okay.

27:14.545 --> 27:16.939
I've got to head out
to the barn for a minute.

27:16.983 --> 27:18.027
Excuse me.

27:28.081 --> 27:30.605
[Holly]: I don't know, George.
Maybe Sam's right.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.738
Maybe the tree should stay.

27:32.781 --> 27:34.653
Maybe...

27:34.696 --> 27:36.393
but I also have some
mighty fond memories

27:36.437 --> 27:39.658
of Leslie at
the Radcliffe tree.

27:39.701 --> 27:42.051
The sound of her
off-key caroling,

27:42.095 --> 27:44.227
and the way her face
would brighten,

27:44.271 --> 27:46.490
seeing it light up...

27:46.534 --> 27:48.101
I think she would have
wanted to donate it.

27:48.144 --> 27:49.537
But Sam doesn't agree,

27:49.580 --> 27:51.887
and I just don't want
to upset anybody.

27:51.931 --> 27:53.193
Don't you worry
about my Sam.

27:53.236 --> 27:55.108
He's an enigma.

27:55.151 --> 27:57.066
He is definitely an enigma.

27:57.110 --> 27:58.154
[chuckles]

28:32.362 --> 28:33.929
[phone rings
with "Jingle Bells" ringtone]

28:36.453 --> 28:37.803
Hello?

28:37.846 --> 28:39.543
Holly,
that tree is perfect!

28:39.587 --> 28:40.588
[Holly]: Yeah...

28:40.631 --> 28:41.850
except that I don't have it,

28:41.894 --> 28:42.982
and the McNarys
might not give it to me.

28:43.025 --> 28:44.853
This tree is flawless,

28:44.897 --> 28:45.898
and if anyone
can convince them

28:45.941 --> 28:47.290
to donate it, it's you.

28:47.334 --> 28:49.684
Mm, maybe,

28:49.728 --> 28:52.556
but just in case,
we need to find a backup.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.254
Oh, Andrea,
I've got to go.

28:54.297 --> 28:56.038
Oh, okay, Holly, I...

28:56.082 --> 28:57.474
[sighs]

28:57.518 --> 29:00.042
It's perfect.
It's great.

Listen, I... think
I've had enough holiday cheer

29:26.721 --> 29:27.896
for a little while.

29:27.940 --> 29:29.158
Yeah, I know,

29:29.202 --> 29:33.902
and I just wanted
to apologize

29:33.946 --> 29:35.686
for overstepping

Listen, Sam, I'm going
to respect your wishes,

and if you want me to
leave right now, I will.

to know

isn't just a tree, okay,

29:48.090 --> 29:49.788
and the Radcliffe tree
isn't just a tree.

29:53.095 --> 29:54.749
My mom also passed away.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.360
It happened
when I was just a baby,

29:57.404 --> 29:59.058
and my dad raised me

29:59.101 --> 30:00.886
until he got sick
when I was in college.

30:00.929 --> 30:03.366
He was my very best friend,

30:03.410 --> 30:04.803
and if you can believe it,

30:04.846 --> 30:05.934
he actually loved Christmas
as much as I do.

30:05.978 --> 30:07.196
Whoa.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.850
Yeah, right?

30:08.894 --> 30:09.851
He was...

30:11.635 --> 30:12.636
Mr. Christmas?

30:12.680 --> 30:14.029
Yeah.

30:14.073 --> 30:16.858
Actually,
that's exactly what he was.

30:16.902 --> 30:21.167
You know, and every year,
with the Radcliffe tree,

30:21.210 --> 30:23.430
I get to celebrate my dad

30:23.473 --> 30:27.564
and his love for Christmas
and beauty and magic.

30:29.349 --> 30:32.178
I get to feel like
he's here with me again.

30:35.964 --> 30:39.489
Look, if I'm being
honest with you,

30:39.533 --> 30:41.274
I just don't think
there's anything you can say

30:41.317 --> 30:42.449
that's going to make me
change my mind.

30:42.492 --> 30:44.799
Yeah, doesn't mean
I'll stop talking.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.888
[laughs]

30:46.932 --> 30:49.108
I'll listen to your pitch.

30:49.151 --> 30:50.196
Unless that was it?

30:50.239 --> 30:52.807
Oh, no.
Unfortunately for you...

30:52.851 --> 30:53.503
[both]: There's more.

30:53.547 --> 30:54.896
Yeah.

31:03.209 --> 31:04.863
Thank you.

31:06.995 --> 31:09.650
[phone rings
with "Jingle Bells" ringtone]

31:09.693 --> 31:11.130
Hey!

31:11.173 --> 31:12.174
[Erin]:
I just saw the picture!

31:12.218 --> 31:13.697
Beyond perfect, right?

31:13.741 --> 31:16.004
Are you talking about the tree
or the man,

31:16.048 --> 31:18.528
because yes, ha, ha,
he is perfect!

31:18.572 --> 31:19.834
Erin, that's Sam.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.923
The Grinch?

31:21.967 --> 31:23.098
Ah, you know,
he's not really a Grinch.

31:23.142 --> 31:24.360
He just hates Christmas.

31:24.404 --> 31:26.101
Maybe more of a Scrooge.

31:26.145 --> 31:28.277
No, he's not really a Scrooge,
either.

31:28.321 --> 31:29.888
He's just...

31:29.931 --> 31:31.106
he's just protecting his family.

31:31.150 --> 31:33.239
"Protecting his family?"

31:33.282 --> 31:35.719
Wait a minute.
Do you have feelings for Sam?

31:35.763 --> 31:37.286
What?

31:37.330 --> 31:40.420
No!
That's crazy.

31:40.463 --> 31:42.944
Look, we're just...
We're really different,

31:42.988 --> 31:44.728
and anyways, I don't know
how I could love a man

31:44.772 --> 31:45.642
who doesn't like Christmas.

31:45.686 --> 31:46.687
That's true.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.036
Yeah.
Anyway, listen.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.951
The tree-lighting ceremony
is in eight days.

31:49.995 --> 31:51.170
Can we just stay focused?

31:51.213 --> 31:52.214
Relax.
Don't worry about it.

31:52.258 --> 31:53.607
You're going to get the tree.

31:53.650 --> 31:54.390
I'm too stressed
to relax right now.

31:54.434 --> 31:55.391
Wish me luck.

31:55.435 --> 31:56.740
I'm rooting for you.

31:58.133 --> 31:59.526
Just... tree joke.
Never mind.

31:59.569 --> 32:00.919
Good one.

32:03.008 --> 32:05.662
Okay, thank you all
for coming to my presentation.

32:05.706 --> 32:07.447
And thank you
for the cookies!

32:07.490 --> 32:08.927
[chuckles]

32:08.970 --> 32:09.928
So I know
you watch the Radcliffe ceremony

32:09.971 --> 32:11.277
on TV every year,

32:11.320 --> 32:13.322
but many people
don't know its history,

32:13.366 --> 32:16.021
so I wanted
to share it with you.

32:16.064 --> 32:17.413
And you did all this
for us?

32:17.457 --> 32:18.980
Mm...

32:19.024 --> 32:21.200
I might have had some of it
prepared already.

32:21.243 --> 32:22.157
Okay...

32:25.291 --> 32:27.162
[Holly, recorded audio]:
In 1930,

32:27.206 --> 32:28.903
during the Great Depression,

32:28.947 --> 32:30.470
the first
Radcliffe Christmas tree

32:30.513 --> 32:31.993
was placed in the plaza

32:32.037 --> 32:34.387
for everyone
who couldn't afford a tree.

32:34.430 --> 32:35.997
Decorated
with gum wrapper garlands

32:36.041 --> 32:37.433
and tin cans,

32:37.477 --> 32:40.480
it became a centerpiece
of the community.

32:40.523 --> 32:44.875
Neighbors gathered around it,
caroled, and shared food.

32:44.919 --> 32:47.487
Since then, every year,

32:47.530 --> 32:49.315
the Radcliffe Center
has had a tree,

32:49.358 --> 32:50.925
and although the trees

32:50.969 --> 32:52.796
get more elaborate
and spectacular

32:52.840 --> 32:54.363
every year,

32:54.407 --> 32:57.497
we never forget
what it started as...

32:57.540 --> 32:59.107
a symbol of community...

32:59.151 --> 33:03.329
a place for people
to come together...

33:03.372 --> 33:06.245
a gathering spot for families,
friends, and neighbors

33:06.288 --> 33:08.682
to be cheered, supported,

33:08.725 --> 33:10.031
and marvel

33:10.075 --> 33:10.901
not just
in the beauty of the season,

33:10.945 --> 33:12.686
but in each other...

33:15.689 --> 33:19.867
which is what Leslie's tree
could be to so many people.

33:30.051 --> 33:31.922
I vote yes!

33:35.404 --> 33:37.667
Holly,
this is wonderful...

33:37.711 --> 33:38.842
but I think we need
some more time

33:38.886 --> 33:39.887
to mull it over.

33:39.930 --> 33:42.846
Could we have
more time?

33:42.890 --> 33:44.587
I wish I could give you
all the time in the world.

33:44.631 --> 33:47.503
I know this is a huge decision
for all of you,

33:47.547 --> 33:50.724
but the tree lighting
is literally around the corner,

33:50.767 --> 33:52.073
and it takes time

33:52.117 --> 33:53.857
to transport and decorate,

33:53.901 --> 33:56.773
and in the end, if you say no...

33:56.817 --> 33:58.123
Could you
at least give us

33:58.166 --> 33:59.994
till tomorrow?

34:00.038 --> 34:01.952
And that way,
that'll give us some time

34:01.996 --> 34:03.606
to ask any questions
we might have.

34:03.650 --> 34:05.652
What do you think?

34:05.695 --> 34:07.610
Could you stay
a little longer?

34:13.659 --> 34:15.096
I'd love to.

34:15.139 --> 34:16.097
-[Joey]: Yes!
-Great.

34:16.141 --> 34:17.620
[Holly]:
Hey, Joey?

34:17.664 --> 34:21.188
How about you show me
around the Christmas festival?

34:21.233 --> 34:22.668
Come on.

34:22.712 --> 34:23.931
[they laugh]

34:28.414 --> 34:30.458
The festival starts
in a few days

34:30.503 --> 34:32.809
and goes straight through
until Christmas.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.027
It's really famous.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.420
People come
from all over the world

34:35.464 --> 34:36.987
to see it.

34:37.031 --> 34:38.119
All over the midwest,
anyway.

34:39.512 --> 34:41.469
That's where Santa will be...

34:42.862 --> 34:44.299
and that's where
the food is.

34:44.342 --> 34:46.649
Everyone brings something.

34:46.693 --> 34:48.260
Grandma and me
used to make

34:48.303 --> 34:49.696
the best Christmas cookies.

34:49.739 --> 34:52.481
Grandpa tried last year,
but they were like...

34:52.525 --> 34:53.438
what'd you call them?

34:53.482 --> 34:54.483
Charcoal.

34:54.527 --> 34:55.745
[Joey]:
Yeah.

34:55.789 --> 34:57.530
There's Owen.
I'll be right back.

34:57.573 --> 34:58.487
Okay.

35:08.193 --> 35:10.238
I like Klaus.

35:10.282 --> 35:11.892
Well, I think
you'd like any town

35:11.935 --> 35:13.285
that took Christmas
this seriously.

35:14.329 --> 35:15.330
It's good for us.

35:15.374 --> 35:16.244
It's good for
the businesses,

35:16.288 --> 35:17.854
good for town morale.

35:17.898 --> 35:19.552
Good for everyone
but you.

35:19.595 --> 35:21.597
Why do you dislike Christmas
so much?

35:21.641 --> 35:23.121
[phone rings
with "Jingle Bells" ringtone]

35:23.164 --> 35:24.470
Oh, hang on...

35:24.513 --> 35:25.384
Right. I'm going
to be down here.

35:25.427 --> 35:26.211
Okay.

35:26.254 --> 35:27.125
Hello?

35:27.168 --> 35:28.517
How did the pitch go?

35:28.561 --> 35:29.779
Did they say yes?
Do you have the tree?

35:29.823 --> 35:31.651
Uh, no, not yet.

35:31.694 --> 35:33.305
They responded really well,

35:33.348 --> 35:35.611
but they just need another day
to decide.

35:35.655 --> 35:37.091
Another day?

35:37.135 --> 35:39.180
Holly,
the ceremony is in eight days,

35:39.224 --> 35:41.095
We need at least four days
to decorate,

35:41.139 --> 35:42.966
and that leaves us
exactly three days

35:43.010 --> 35:45.578
to have a tree located,
cut, and transported here.

35:45.621 --> 35:46.492
What am I supposed
to tell corporate?

35:46.535 --> 35:47.449
Corporate?

35:47.493 --> 35:49.277
Yes.

35:49.321 --> 35:50.800
Corporate has gotten involved,
and they are not happy...

35:50.844 --> 35:53.847
and I'm sorry, Holly, but...

35:53.890 --> 35:56.893
they said if you don't have
a "Radcliffe-worthy tree"

35:56.937 --> 35:58.634
here in Chicago
in three days,

35:58.678 --> 35:59.940
then...

35:59.983 --> 36:02.029
don't bother
coming back at all.

36:24.138 --> 36:26.619
Hey.

36:26.662 --> 36:28.403
Good morning.

36:28.447 --> 36:29.578
What are you doing up
this early?

36:29.622 --> 36:30.927
Oh, I'm always
up early.

36:30.971 --> 36:33.234
Just the farmer
in me.

36:33.278 --> 36:34.670
What are you
doing here?

36:34.714 --> 36:37.673
We do
McNary family breakfast

36:37.717 --> 36:39.632
on Sundays, so...

36:39.675 --> 36:41.242
I'm always early,
I'm always waiting,

36:41.286 --> 36:44.071
so I grab coffee
and head outside.

36:44.114 --> 36:45.899
Care to join?

36:45.942 --> 36:47.292
You had me
at coffee.

36:47.335 --> 36:48.597
[chuckles]

36:56.692 --> 36:58.607
Usually from
the minute I wake up,

36:58.651 --> 36:59.956
it's just go, go, go.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.262
It's so nice

37:01.306 --> 37:03.743
to have some time
to just breathe.

37:03.786 --> 37:07.050
It's so beautiful
here, so peaceful.

37:07.094 --> 37:08.182
It reminds me of home.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.662
Of Chicago?

37:09.705 --> 37:11.359
Oh, no, no, no,
Chicago's where I live,

37:11.403 --> 37:14.710
but my family's farm...
that was home.

37:14.754 --> 37:16.277
I guess I always figured
I'd end up back there.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.714
So why didn't you?

37:18.758 --> 37:20.194
Well, the plan

37:20.238 --> 37:21.630
was that I'd get a
degree in horticulture

37:21.674 --> 37:24.329
and then return home.

37:24.372 --> 37:28.594
My parents had this dream
of expanding the farm,

37:28.637 --> 37:29.682
and as I got older,

37:29.725 --> 37:30.900
it became a dream
of my own,

37:30.944 --> 37:33.773
something I wanted
to do for myself,

37:33.816 --> 37:35.122
and for my mom,

37:35.165 --> 37:37.211
for her legacy,

37:37.255 --> 37:40.301
especially at
Christmas time...

37:40.345 --> 37:42.782
but when my dad
passed away,

37:42.825 --> 37:46.307
I had to decide between
school and the farm.

37:46.351 --> 37:47.961
I was 19
at the time,

37:48.004 --> 37:50.006
and the thought of
running a business alone

37:50.050 --> 37:51.878
just was
terrifying, right?

37:51.921 --> 37:54.010
So I sold the land,

37:54.054 --> 37:56.665
and I got a job
at Radcliffe,

37:56.709 --> 37:57.579
and I moved
to Chicago...

37:57.623 --> 37:59.146
And became a city girl.

37:59.189 --> 38:00.103
[giggles]

38:00.147 --> 38:01.496
Yeah, I guess

38:01.540 --> 38:02.976
I am just a little
bit of a city girl.

38:03.019 --> 38:03.890
I do get nervous if I'm
more than a block away

38:03.933 --> 38:06.109
from a cup of coffee.

38:06.153 --> 38:09.025
I guess I've grown
accustomed to city life.

38:09.069 --> 38:10.418
Sounds to me

38:10.462 --> 38:12.333
like you just want to find
a place called home.

38:16.250 --> 38:19.297
You got anything tying you
to Chicago? Boyfriend?

38:20.646 --> 38:23.083
Uh... no.

38:23.126 --> 38:25.694
No, unfortunately,
when you work as much as I do,

38:25.738 --> 38:26.652
it's kind of hard to date.

38:29.176 --> 38:30.873
What about you?

38:30.917 --> 38:33.572
[snickers]
No, no, no, no.

After my divorce,
I just...

38:36.531 --> 38:38.316
and you know what?

38:38.359 --> 38:39.882
This time for Joey and I
just to be by ourselves,

38:39.926 --> 38:40.796
it's been great.

38:40.840 --> 38:43.146

we're both ready.

39:23.186 --> 39:25.275
It's completely
undone.

39:26.581 --> 39:27.539
[Holly]: Oh!

39:27.582 --> 39:28.844
That's pretty good.

39:31.543 --> 39:33.414
-Holly!
-Hi!

39:33.458 --> 39:34.937
[Sam]: "Holly"?
Really?

39:34.981 --> 39:36.417
Hey...

39:36.461 --> 39:37.418
Come here.

39:39.551 --> 39:40.508
What is all this?

39:40.552 --> 39:42.162
[Holly]: Egg nog
French toast.

39:42.205 --> 39:44.556
It's Christmas
morning breakfast?

39:44.599 --> 39:46.035
This is our mom's

39:46.079 --> 39:47.515
go-to Christmas morning
breakfast.

39:47.559 --> 39:48.690
I know.
Sam told me...

39:48.734 --> 39:49.996
and it turns out

39:50.039 --> 39:51.432
that I have a pretty
good recipe too.

39:51.476 --> 39:52.955
You sure you don't need
some of my help here?

39:52.999 --> 39:54.217
Um, yeah.

39:54.261 --> 39:55.480
Could you
burn it for us?

39:55.523 --> 39:58.221
Give me a shot.
I'll see what I can do.

39:58.265 --> 39:59.440
-Why don't you set the table?
-Sure.

39:59.484 --> 40:01.703
And there's juice
that needs a pitcher,

40:01.747 --> 40:02.574
and maple syrup?

40:02.617 --> 40:03.792
Got it.

40:03.836 --> 40:04.924
[Sam]: Put that
on the table?

40:04.967 --> 40:08.144
♪ It's the best time
of the year ♪

40:08.188 --> 40:11.104

40:11.147 --> 40:12.932
[Holly]: So I just secured
the Norway spruce

40:12.975 --> 40:13.802
outside of Elkhart Lake

40:13.846 --> 40:14.803
as a backup.

40:14.847 --> 40:16.196
[Erin]: I thought

40:16.239 --> 40:17.545
that that tree
was 10 feet too short.

40:17.589 --> 40:19.286
Well, that's the best backup
that I found.

40:19.329 --> 40:20.200
Do you have a better option?

40:20.243 --> 40:21.375
No.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.420
I'm stumped.

40:22.463 --> 40:24.247
Pun intended.

40:24.291 --> 40:26.598
Don't worry.
We won't even use it.

40:26.641 --> 40:27.599
The McNarys will say yes.

40:27.642 --> 40:29.252
Well, let's hope so,

40:29.296 --> 40:32.604
because if this backup
isn't "Radcliffe worthy..."

40:32.647 --> 40:33.561
I'm fired.

40:34.780 --> 40:36.825
I've got to go.

40:36.869 --> 40:38.479
I'm just pretending
to be working

40:38.523 --> 40:40.438
but really, I'm wrapping
Aimee's presents.

40:40.481 --> 40:42.265
How did Aimee
convince you to do that?

40:42.309 --> 40:43.615
Oh, I offered to help.

40:43.658 --> 40:44.485
To be honest,
I love gift wrapping.

40:44.529 --> 40:46.139
Of course you do.

40:46.182 --> 40:49.098
I actually love
all Christmas preparations.

40:49.142 --> 40:50.012
I kind of go all out.

40:52.275 --> 40:53.451
Holly...

40:54.974 --> 40:57.324
I want the tree
to go to Chicago.

40:57.367 --> 40:58.630
Really?

40:58.673 --> 41:00.153
That's...

41:00.196 --> 41:02.024
that's great news.

41:02.068 --> 41:03.504
Um... wow!

41:06.986 --> 41:09.858
Um, can I ask what
made up your mind?

41:09.902 --> 41:12.382
Well, I was...

41:12.426 --> 41:15.690
just thinking about how happy
the Radcliffe tree made Leslie,

41:15.734 --> 41:19.477
and how she made
everyone around her happy,

41:19.520 --> 41:21.914
especially at Christmas,

41:21.957 --> 41:25.744
and I think
this is one more opportunity

41:25.787 --> 41:27.441
for Leslie
to bring joy to others,

41:27.485 --> 41:31.010
and I know
she'd want you to take it.

41:32.098 --> 41:33.099
I've got to go.

41:33.142 --> 41:35.971
The cows are calling.

41:36.015 --> 41:39.192
One, two, three, four,
I declare one more.

41:39.235 --> 41:40.715
Aaah!

41:41.847 --> 41:42.587
[Sam]: Hey.

41:42.630 --> 41:44.023
Hi.

41:44.066 --> 41:45.285
Hey, we have to take off,

41:45.328 --> 41:46.504
but maybe we'll see you
tomorrow?

41:46.547 --> 41:48.201
Yeah.

41:48.244 --> 41:49.028
[Joey]: But we still haven't
found the angel ornament.

41:49.071 --> 41:51.770
I know, buddy.
Come on.

41:51.813 --> 41:53.336
I'm decorating
our family wreath,

41:53.380 --> 41:54.642
and I wanted to put

41:54.686 --> 41:57.036
all of Grandma's favorite
ornaments on it.

41:57.079 --> 41:58.472
The angel
was her most favorite.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.213
[George]: Mm.
You guys stay.

42:00.256 --> 42:01.475
I'll head back.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.042
You sure?

42:03.085 --> 42:04.565
Enjoy yourselves.

42:14.183 --> 42:15.097
Oh, wow...

42:20.712 --> 42:22.540
What if we can't find it?

42:22.583 --> 42:24.629
Well...

42:24.672 --> 42:25.847
oh...

42:25.891 --> 42:27.675
Okay.

42:27.719 --> 42:29.503
I know you have your heart
set on the angel ornament,

42:29.547 --> 42:31.113
but sometimes,

42:31.157 --> 42:32.506
when you're looking
for one thing,

42:32.550 --> 42:34.421
you end up finding
something else

42:34.464 --> 42:36.118
just as beautiful.

42:38.643 --> 42:41.167
That was the first ornament
I ever made.

42:41.210 --> 42:42.255
I gave it to Grandma.

42:42.298 --> 42:43.430
[Holly]:
You know what?

42:43.473 --> 42:44.692
And I bet
this was her real favorite,

42:44.736 --> 42:45.693
and I think
it's going to look perfect

42:45.737 --> 42:46.955
on your family wreath.

42:53.396 --> 42:55.224
Aunt Aimee, can we
decorate the inn?

42:55.268 --> 42:56.182
[Aimee]:
Sure!

42:56.225 --> 42:57.618
Sam can help.

42:59.402 --> 43:00.403
Great.

43:02.144 --> 43:05.321
[♪♪]

43:14.853 --> 43:16.768
I can't just sit inside

43:16.811 --> 43:18.334
while you guys
are out here decorating.

43:18.378 --> 43:19.292
[muttering]
About time.

43:19.335 --> 43:21.468
Ha, ha.

43:25.385 --> 43:26.995
It's beautiful.

43:29.041 --> 43:30.608
It's just like how
Grandma used to do it.

43:35.351 --> 43:36.526
Let's put the bow...

43:43.838 --> 43:45.579
Untangling
all these lights

43:45.623 --> 43:46.798
brought back traumatic
Christmas memories for me,

43:46.841 --> 43:48.495
just so you know.

43:48.538 --> 43:51.019
Can you really say you've never
enjoyed the holidays?

43:51.063 --> 43:52.455
Not even a little?

43:52.499 --> 43:54.588
I, uh, I haven't always
been a Grinch.

43:54.632 --> 43:55.763
Aw, you're
not a Grinch.

43:55.807 --> 43:57.417
You're much more of a Scrooge.

43:57.460 --> 43:59.767
[laughs]
Um... thanks?

43:59.811 --> 44:00.768
I'll get it.

44:00.812 --> 44:02.030
Okay.

44:04.076 --> 44:05.599
This Scrooge

44:05.643 --> 44:06.948
actually tolerated Christmas
at one point.

44:06.992 --> 44:07.993
"Tolerate?"

44:08.036 --> 44:08.950
How spirited of you.

44:08.994 --> 44:10.517
Hey...

44:10.560 --> 44:13.259
you get divorced
and your mom passes away?

44:13.302 --> 44:15.348
Just makes everything...

44:15.391 --> 44:16.305
you know?

44:19.831 --> 44:20.962
Got it?

44:21.006 --> 44:22.137
Yeah.

44:22.181 --> 44:23.008
All right,
I think we're done.

44:23.051 --> 44:24.705
Let's take a look.

44:31.407 --> 44:33.671
[Joey]:
It's perfect!

44:35.629 --> 44:38.458
Ah.
Nice.

44:38.501 --> 44:39.851
All right, hey,
we've got to head home,

44:39.894 --> 44:40.982
so why don't you go
hop in the truck, okay?

44:41.026 --> 44:42.592
Okay.

44:46.771 --> 44:47.641
I'm going to start...

44:47.685 --> 44:49.817
[laughs]

44:51.863 --> 44:53.865
Sam, being here with you
has been...

44:53.908 --> 44:54.822
amazing...

44:56.476 --> 44:57.869
but I do need
to figure this out,

44:57.912 --> 44:58.826
and I'm running out of time.

44:58.870 --> 45:00.045
Look, I'm sorry.

45:00.088 --> 45:03.526
I've just been
dragging my feet. I...

45:03.570 --> 45:06.616
I'm sure you just want
to get back on your way, so...

45:06.660 --> 45:07.748
I'm just still on the fence.

45:11.447 --> 45:12.927
Thanks for helping.

45:22.284 --> 45:23.633
[Aimee and Holly giggle]

45:24.896 --> 45:26.593
Thank you, Holly.

45:26.636 --> 45:28.073
Joey is so happy,

45:28.116 --> 45:31.554
and it's so nice to see
the inn decorated again.

45:31.598 --> 45:32.642
[grunting]

45:34.253 --> 45:35.515
Between you and me,

45:35.558 --> 45:37.212
I think
even Sam enjoyed himself.

45:37.256 --> 45:38.344
Me too.

45:38.387 --> 45:39.214
[laughs]
Here, I'll take that.

45:39.258 --> 45:40.476
Oh...

45:40.520 --> 45:41.303
[gasps]
Ooh, wait!

45:41.347 --> 45:42.783
Aimee!

45:42.827 --> 45:45.655
Is this the ornament
Joey was looking for?

45:46.918 --> 45:48.397
We should tell him

45:48.441 --> 45:50.443
so he can put it
on the wreath.

45:50.486 --> 45:52.184
Actually, you know
where I want to put that?

45:52.227 --> 45:54.273
On my mom's tree...

45:54.316 --> 45:57.363
at the Radcliffe Plaza.

45:57.406 --> 45:58.320
Really?

45:58.364 --> 45:59.757
Mm-hm.

45:59.800 --> 46:01.019
I keep thinking

46:01.062 --> 46:02.368
of the great memories
from the tree.

46:02.411 --> 46:05.153
In the winter, we
would collect boughs

46:05.197 --> 46:06.154
and make wreaths,

46:06.198 --> 46:07.677
then in the summer,

46:07.721 --> 46:10.115
we would have picnics
under the tree's shade.

46:12.117 --> 46:13.640
I'll miss the tree,

46:13.683 --> 46:16.817
but it'll be so special
to see it in Chicago.

46:18.384 --> 46:19.515
Now you just have
to convince Sam,

46:19.559 --> 46:20.908
which, after today,

46:20.952 --> 46:21.735
I don't think will take
as much convincing

46:21.779 --> 46:23.302
as I thought.

46:23.345 --> 46:25.304
It's beginning to look
a little like Christmas.

46:33.138 --> 46:35.967
[Erin]: So you've got
three out of the four.

46:36.010 --> 46:37.272
That's a majority vote.

46:37.316 --> 46:39.927
Well...
I want it to be unanimous.

46:39.971 --> 46:41.842
I don't want Sam to feel like
I stole something from him.

46:41.886 --> 46:43.931
Well...

46:43.975 --> 46:46.238
fingers crossed
that he says yes tomorrow.

46:46.281 --> 46:48.066
I mean, he could ask
for one more day.

46:48.109 --> 46:49.894
It sounds like he just wants
to spend more time with you.

46:49.937 --> 46:51.809
That is not
what he's doing.

46:54.594 --> 46:56.378
Although...

46:56.422 --> 46:58.293
staying
doesn't sound so bad.

46:58.337 --> 47:00.034
Klaus is lovely...

47:01.949 --> 47:03.603
and, um...

47:03.646 --> 47:04.778
I'm actually starting
to think

47:04.822 --> 47:07.868
that maybe the tree should stay.

47:07.912 --> 47:09.696
Maybe it belongs here.

47:09.739 --> 47:10.653
Holly...

47:10.697 --> 47:11.611
What?

47:12.568 --> 47:14.092

47:14.135 --> 47:16.442
And with a week
until the tree lighting,

47:16.485 --> 47:19.488
the Radcliffe Center tree
is still not here.

47:19.532 --> 47:21.839
The "City in a Garden"
might be tree-less.

47:21.882 --> 47:23.971
Looks like the heart of America

47:24.015 --> 47:25.755
might have lost
its Christmas Spirit.

Hey.

47:44.252 --> 47:45.253
Thanks for coming.

47:45.297 --> 47:46.994
What's going on?

47:47.038 --> 47:48.691
So I know you need more time
to think about the tree,

47:48.735 --> 47:50.171
but I also know

47:50.215 --> 47:50.911
that I was just going
to spend the whole day

47:50.955 --> 47:53.479
working and stressing,

47:53.522 --> 47:56.743
so I decided, in the spirit
of Christmas and slowing down,

47:56.786 --> 47:58.832
to take the day off

47:58.876 --> 48:01.487
and partake
in some holiday activities.

48:01.530 --> 48:02.967
Uh-oh.

48:03.010 --> 48:04.620
Yeah. I thought maybe
you'd like to join me.

48:04.664 --> 48:06.927
Is this, like,
a personal mission of yours

48:06.971 --> 48:09.147
to get me to change
how I feel about Christmas?

49:03.549 --> 49:04.942
Grandma and me used to do this!

49:04.985 --> 49:06.160
[Holly]:
Really?

49:06.204 --> 49:07.988
My dad and I
used to do this too.

49:08.032 --> 49:09.598
We'd hand-deliver
as many Christmas cards

49:09.642 --> 49:10.512
as possible.

49:12.471 --> 49:15.735
Now, this
is a very special card.

49:15.778 --> 49:16.910
Why?

49:16.954 --> 49:18.956
Because it's from you
to me,

49:18.999 --> 49:20.566
and when I get it in the mail,

49:20.609 --> 49:21.784
I'm going to remember
this moment.

49:21.828 --> 49:23.525
[Joey]:
Cool!

49:23.569 --> 49:24.918
So I know you said
you and your grandma

49:24.962 --> 49:26.093
used to bake cookies
for the festival...

49:27.442 --> 49:28.878
We're going to bake
Christmas cookies?

49:28.922 --> 49:29.879
Yes, we are,

49:29.923 --> 49:31.490
but first,

49:31.533 --> 49:32.708
we're going to make
the hot chocolate to drink

49:32.752 --> 49:34.536
while we bake the cookies.

49:34.580 --> 49:36.190
Yes!

49:36.234 --> 49:37.583
Your grandma might have had
the best cookie recipe,

49:37.626 --> 49:40.194
but I have
the best hot chocolate recipe.

49:41.804 --> 49:42.892
Mm, okay.

49:42.936 --> 49:44.285
[Holly]: Oh...

49:44.329 --> 49:45.069
That's right,
we'll be the judge of that.

49:45.112 --> 49:46.113
Oh, it's on.

49:46.157 --> 49:47.114
Let's go.

49:47.158 --> 49:48.463
Boom.

49:48.507 --> 49:49.943
[laughs]

49:49.987 --> 49:51.162
[Holly]: Okay,
are we ready for this?

49:51.205 --> 49:52.641
[Joey]: Oh, yeah.

49:52.685 --> 49:53.642
Whoa...

49:53.686 --> 49:54.774
Oooh...

49:54.817 --> 49:55.644
[Joey]: Nice.

49:55.688 --> 49:57.124
Yeah!

49:57.168 --> 49:58.082
They're perfect!

49:58.125 --> 49:59.344
Definitely not charcoal.

49:59.387 --> 50:00.954
Did you think they would be?

50:00.998 --> 50:01.911
Maybe.

50:01.955 --> 50:03.652
Oh-ho-ho.

50:03.696 --> 50:05.437
Okay, why don't you put
the cookies over here,

50:05.480 --> 50:08.483
and we can get started
on the icing.

50:08.527 --> 50:09.876
[Joey]: Sure.

50:17.362 --> 50:18.928
[they laugh]

50:26.197 --> 50:28.808
Before cutting down trees
was the tradition,

50:28.851 --> 50:30.070
people used to put
evergreen boughs

50:30.114 --> 50:31.854
in their homes,

50:31.898 --> 50:34.031
and the boughs
were a reminder

50:34.074 --> 50:36.163
that no matter
how harsh the winter,

50:36.207 --> 50:37.295
spring would
always return,

50:37.338 --> 50:39.384
and that's what
a Christmas tree is,

50:39.427 --> 50:40.950
a reminder of hope.

50:56.183 --> 50:57.750
Sorry.

50:57.793 --> 50:59.056
It's just so beautiful.

50:59.099 --> 51:00.927
[Sam]:
Don't apologize.

51:00.970 --> 51:02.711
I'd like to look at something
the way you look at that tree.

51:04.104 --> 51:06.454
Grandma's tree is going
to look awesome in Chicago!

51:12.286 --> 51:14.027
You know what?

51:14.071 --> 51:15.724
I bet there's a good one
right through there.

51:15.768 --> 51:17.117
Want to go check it out?

51:17.161 --> 51:18.075
[Joey]: Yeah.

51:23.297 --> 51:25.082
Thanks for being
so patient.

51:25.125 --> 51:26.692
Klaus and your family

51:26.735 --> 51:28.911
makes being patient
pretty easy...

51:30.261 --> 51:32.350
and honestly, Sam,

51:32.393 --> 51:35.527
whatever you decide
about the tree,

51:35.570 --> 51:37.572
I'm just so happy
that I came.

51:40.793 --> 51:41.924
[clears throat]

51:41.968 --> 51:44.623
Me too.
[chuckles]

51:44.666 --> 51:46.364
[Joey]:
I found it!

51:46.407 --> 51:47.495
I found our Christmas tree.

51:48.714 --> 51:50.846
[Sam]: Yeah?
Did you get a good one?

51:50.890 --> 51:52.109
[Joey]:
It's perfect.

51:52.152 --> 51:53.936
This might work, huh?

51:53.980 --> 51:56.591
Maybe we should ask
the tree expert.

51:56.635 --> 51:58.376
Well?

51:58.419 --> 51:59.942
Joey, how do you make
finding the perfect tree

51:59.986 --> 52:01.596
look so easy?

52:01.640 --> 52:02.597
Are you after my job?

52:02.641 --> 52:04.164
[Sam chuckles]

52:04.208 --> 52:05.687
[Sam]: I think
you're old enough

52:05.731 --> 52:06.645
for this now, huh?

52:06.688 --> 52:08.255
Really?

52:08.299 --> 52:10.736
Yeah. Okay.
Come on, get in here.

52:10.779 --> 52:13.478
We do long, just smooth,
slow strokes, okay?

52:13.521 --> 52:15.132
You let the saw
do the work.

52:15.175 --> 52:16.220
I'll help you
get started.

52:16.263 --> 52:17.960
Got it?

52:18.004 --> 52:19.875
[sawing]

52:23.052 --> 52:24.184
Good job.

52:27.361 --> 52:29.842
[Sam]: All right, here.
Think this will do it.

52:29.885 --> 52:31.148
Yeah? That's
good, right?

52:31.191 --> 52:32.540
Yeah.

52:32.584 --> 52:35.717
["Angels We Have Heard on High"
playing]

52:35.761 --> 52:37.371
Joey, you're a pro.

52:38.329 --> 52:39.504
Thanks.

52:39.547 --> 52:41.201
Okay, I have something
for you.

52:41.245 --> 52:42.159
Really?

52:42.202 --> 52:43.116
Yes.

52:43.160 --> 52:44.073
[Sam]:
What?

52:44.117 --> 52:46.206
[Joey]:
What is it?

52:48.382 --> 52:50.341
It's an angel!

52:51.733 --> 52:53.474
[Holly]: My mother's
family has a tradition

52:53.518 --> 52:55.650
of using an angel
instead of a star

52:55.694 --> 52:56.869
on the top
of the tree.

52:56.912 --> 52:58.784
It's a reminder
of everyone we love

52:58.827 --> 53:00.046
looking out for us.

53:00.089 --> 53:01.482
It's actually
a tradition I brought

53:01.526 --> 53:03.223
to the Radcliffe Center.

53:03.267 --> 53:05.225
I have one just like it
on my tree.

53:12.406 --> 53:13.581
It's perfect.

53:15.148 --> 53:16.584
[Holly]: I just think
it's so beautiful

53:16.628 --> 53:19.239
how our mothers have
influenced our Christmases.

53:19.283 --> 53:20.501
[Sam]: What do
you say, buddy?

53:20.545 --> 53:21.459
Thank you.

53:21.502 --> 53:22.242
[Holly]:
You're welcome.

53:22.286 --> 53:23.635
Thank you.

53:23.678 --> 53:25.071
[Holly]: On the farm,
we always had

53:25.114 --> 53:27.160
a fresh Christmas tree,
with roots.

53:27.204 --> 53:29.945
My dad would always say,

53:29.989 --> 53:32.600
"Love is like
a Christmas tree.

53:32.644 --> 53:35.908
It needs to have roots
and wings."

53:37.475 --> 53:39.128
Hm.

53:41.653 --> 53:43.872
Uh, well, um...

53:43.916 --> 53:44.830
Let's get ready for
the festival tomorrow.

53:44.873 --> 53:45.961
Okay.

53:48.355 --> 53:49.530
I'll meet you
back at the inn.

53:49.574 --> 53:50.444
Okay.

53:52.229 --> 53:53.839
Thanks for that.

53:53.882 --> 53:54.883
No problem.

53:54.927 --> 53:56.842
So, uh..

53:56.885 --> 53:58.800
was an entire day
of Christmas activities

53:58.844 --> 54:00.367
just pure torture for you?

54:00.411 --> 54:02.717
Oh, uh... no.

54:02.761 --> 54:04.110
Um...

54:05.633 --> 54:08.027
You know, what would you say
if I told you

54:08.070 --> 54:09.158
it was actually really nice?

54:09.202 --> 54:11.422
Oh.

54:11.465 --> 54:13.380
I would say "Operation
Lift Sam's Christmas Spirits"

54:13.424 --> 54:14.381
is working...

54:15.991 --> 54:17.689
and I had
a great day too.

54:17.732 --> 54:19.081
Your family's lovely...

54:19.125 --> 54:21.345
Yeah.

54:21.388 --> 54:23.825
And being in Klaus
makes me feel like...

54:25.000 --> 54:26.393
You're home again?

54:26.437 --> 54:28.308
Yeah.

54:33.661 --> 54:34.923
Okay. Well...

54:34.967 --> 54:37.839
I'm going to...
I'm going to go.

54:37.883 --> 54:40.494
Well, you are...

54:40.538 --> 54:43.802
overlooking one
Christmas tradition.

54:43.845 --> 54:45.847
Well, underlooking.

54:47.371 --> 54:48.546
Oh, the vile weed?

54:50.112 --> 54:52.245
And I thought that
was just for holiday people.

54:52.289 --> 54:54.116
Well...

54:54.160 --> 54:56.336
maybe I'm re-thinking
my Grinchhood.

54:57.598 --> 54:58.512
Yeah?

55:01.254 --> 55:02.168
How can I not?

55:06.738 --> 55:07.739
[Joey]: Dad!

55:07.782 --> 55:10.872
We can't find the sweaters.

55:13.179 --> 55:14.398
All right,
I'll be right up.

55:14.441 --> 55:16.225
It's okay.

55:17.705 --> 55:18.663
Good night.

55:18.706 --> 55:20.708
Good night.

55:28.586 --> 55:30.065
[Aimee]:
Okay, it looks good!

55:30.109 --> 55:31.545
She'll be down
any sec, right?

55:31.589 --> 55:33.242
[Aimee]:
Mine's uglier than yours.

55:33.286 --> 55:34.287
[Joey]: No, mine's uglier.

55:34.331 --> 55:35.419
[chuckling]

55:35.462 --> 55:37.377
[George whispering]
Oh, here...

55:37.421 --> 55:38.683
[Holly laughs]
What is going on?

55:38.726 --> 55:40.337
Leslie made them.

55:40.380 --> 55:43.557
Every year, she'd try to make
her ugliest sweater yet.

55:43.601 --> 55:46.255
She was...
repeatedly successful.

55:46.299 --> 55:47.909
[laughing]

55:47.953 --> 55:48.954
It's a family tradition.

55:48.997 --> 55:50.390
So, what do you think?

55:50.434 --> 55:52.610
I think
it's truly...

55:52.653 --> 55:54.176
truly ugly.

55:55.439 --> 55:57.223
The ugliest.

55:57.266 --> 55:58.398
Well, don't laugh
too soon,

I'm so happy
you're here.

56:39.004 --> 56:40.745
Aw, me too.

56:40.788 --> 56:43.095
This is the best Christmas
in a long time,

56:43.138 --> 56:44.879
but I'm actually eight,

01:18:10.773 --> 01:18:12.905
[applause, cheering]

01:18:28.007 --> 01:18:29.617
[crowd]: Aw...

01:18:31.663 --> 01:18:33.099
You're all
I've been thinking about.

01:18:34.666 --> 01:18:36.581
I am so sorry.

01:18:36.624 --> 01:18:37.408
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:18:37.451 --> 01:18:38.496
I was rude,
hurtful,

01:18:38.539 --> 01:18:40.628
terrified...

01:18:40.672 --> 01:18:41.717
of losing you.

01:18:46.243 --> 01:18:47.766
Isn't it amazing?

01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:49.115
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:18:51.074 --> 01:18:52.249
I mean,

01:18:52.292 --> 01:18:53.903
come on,
how'd you pull this off?

01:18:53.946 --> 01:18:55.556
With a lot of help.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.995
Your family thought Klaus
could use a place to gather,

01:18:59.038 --> 01:19:00.344
and thought

01:19:00.387 --> 01:19:00.997
that this could be
part of the festival

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:01.954
every year.

01:19:03.347 --> 01:19:04.304
Oh.

01:19:06.132 --> 01:19:07.090
Every year...

01:19:07.133 --> 01:19:08.439
[chuckles]

01:19:09.570 --> 01:19:12.225
It is unreal.

01:19:12.269 --> 01:19:14.097
and I personally think

01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:15.838
it's just as perfect
as the Radcliffe tree.

01:19:15.881 --> 01:19:17.056
I don't know.

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:18.101
[crowd applauds]

01:19:19.058 --> 01:19:20.016
[Holly]: No, no.

01:19:20.059 --> 01:19:21.452
It's even
more perfect

01:19:21.495 --> 01:19:23.367
because of
who's around it.

01:19:23.410 --> 01:19:25.717
Gotcha.

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:27.850
Listen, everyone,
thank you.

01:19:27.893 --> 01:19:29.199
My mom was...

01:19:29.242 --> 01:19:32.550
the most nurturing person
ever,

01:19:32.593 --> 01:19:35.683
and I always thought
she was one of a kind...

01:19:36.815 --> 01:19:37.816
and then I met someone

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:42.734
who has
the same spirit...

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:43.691
Holly...

01:19:45.215 --> 01:19:47.173
"Miss Christmas"
to all of you.

01:19:48.827 --> 01:19:51.134
You are everything
Christmas stands for,

01:19:51.177 --> 01:19:52.962
which is simply...

01:19:53.005 --> 01:19:56.356
giving to others,

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:59.316
and this is just
one more example,

01:19:59.359 --> 01:20:00.752
because the only reason

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:03.973
that we're all here together
now...

01:20:04.016 --> 01:20:05.278
is because of you.

01:20:05.322 --> 01:20:06.889
Aw...

01:20:06.932 --> 01:20:10.196
So, welcome,
everyone,

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.807
to the first Klaus
Christmas Tree lighting!

01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:15.114
[tune of "Good King Wenceslas"
playing]

01:20:17.595 --> 01:20:19.989
No one's ever said
anything like that to me before.

01:20:20.032 --> 01:20:21.468
Oh, I'm not done.

01:20:21.512 --> 01:20:22.730
Yeah,
unfortunately for you...

01:20:22.774 --> 01:20:24.558
-There's more.
-There's more. Yeah.

01:20:26.125 --> 01:20:28.475
You know,
you said to me

01:20:28.519 --> 01:20:31.261
that Christmas was about
opening your heart...

01:20:31.304 --> 01:20:34.786
which is easier said
than done...

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.005
but you opened mine,

01:20:36.048 --> 01:20:39.008
and I want
to say thanks.

01:20:39.051 --> 01:20:41.010
You still thinking about
leaving the Radcliffe Center?

01:20:41.053 --> 01:20:42.141
I already left.

01:20:42.185 --> 01:20:43.316
What?

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:44.665
Yeah.

01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:46.058
I'm kind of homeless.

01:20:47.190 --> 01:20:48.060
No, you're not.

01:20:52.978 --> 01:20:54.066
Yeah, when I got back
to Chicago,

01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:55.720
I realized...

01:20:55.763 --> 01:20:57.591
I don't want to find
the Radcliffe tree.

01:20:57.635 --> 01:20:59.071
I want to grow it.

01:20:59.115 --> 01:21:00.377
Well, you know,

01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:02.640
Klaus doesn't have
a Christmas tree farm,

01:21:02.683 --> 01:21:04.511
and we actually have
the room for it,

01:21:04.555 --> 01:21:07.427
and as for growing
the Radcliffe tree,

01:21:07.471 --> 01:21:09.429
maybe this is
a good start.

01:21:13.781 --> 01:21:16.219
In 50 years,
we can donate it.

01:21:16.262 --> 01:21:18.003
It actually takes 80 years
to get big enough, but--

01:21:18.047 --> 01:21:19.918
yeah, but we can watch it grow
together.

01:21:19.962 --> 01:21:22.616
How did you know
I was coming?

01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:24.096
Well, one, if you weren't,
I was coming to get you.

01:21:25.489 --> 01:21:26.969
Um, but two...

01:21:27.012 --> 01:21:28.361
Holly? Could we
borrow you a moment?

01:21:28.405 --> 01:21:29.667
Sure.

01:21:29.710 --> 01:21:30.755
-Okay.
-Go ahead.

01:21:33.149 --> 01:21:34.498
[reporter]:
Last night,

01:21:34.541 --> 01:21:35.803
we had the tree lighting

01:21:35.847 --> 01:21:37.370
at Chicago's
Radcliffe Center.

01:21:37.414 --> 01:21:38.806
Tonight, Radcliffe
has come

01:21:38.850 --> 01:21:39.895
to Klaus, Wisconsin,

01:21:39.938 --> 01:21:42.027
and here we have
Miss Christmas

01:21:42.071 --> 01:21:43.724
to tell us
how that happened.

01:21:43.768 --> 01:21:45.901
Well, it all started
with a letter

01:21:45.944 --> 01:21:47.772
from a really special boy
named Joey,

01:21:47.815 --> 01:21:49.905
and, um...
he's here.

01:21:49.948 --> 01:21:50.818
Can he join us?

01:21:50.862 --> 01:21:51.819
Of course.

01:21:51.863 --> 01:21:53.299
Okay. Joey!

01:21:53.343 --> 01:21:54.387
Hi, Joey.

01:21:54.431 --> 01:21:56.694
So you wrote a letter

01:21:56.737 --> 01:21:57.825
to donate this tree
to the Radcliffe Center?

01:21:57.869 --> 01:21:59.479
Yup.

01:21:59.523 --> 01:22:02.047
I wanted the whole world
to see my grandma's tree...

01:22:03.179 --> 01:22:05.224
And guess who mailed
the letter?

01:22:06.182 --> 01:22:07.270
[people chuckle]

01:22:09.011 --> 01:22:10.577
[Holly]:
Okay, well...

01:22:10.621 --> 01:22:12.275
I guess we're ready
for the main attraction.

01:22:12.318 --> 01:22:15.278
-Whoo!
-Yeah!

01:22:15.321 --> 01:22:17.758
Here we go!

01:22:17.802 --> 01:22:19.760
And I wrote
the second letter.

01:22:19.804 --> 01:22:21.937
I just carved the tree
and crossed my fingers.

01:22:26.332 --> 01:22:27.899
[Holly]: Okay, buddy.

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:28.944
Go ahead!

01:22:28.987 --> 01:22:30.771
-Really?
-Go for it.

01:22:30.815 --> 01:22:31.772
Oh yeah!

01:22:32.991 --> 01:22:33.992
[Sam]: All right,
shall we count it down?

01:22:35.211 --> 01:22:37.691
Three... two... one...
