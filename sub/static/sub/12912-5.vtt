00:03.500 --> 00:05.180
<i>* In this world *</i>

00:05.260 --> 00:06.500
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

00:06.580 --> 00:10.300
<i>* You know I love</i>
<i>My island home *</i>

00:10.380 --> 00:11.860
<i>* We'll make this right *</i>

00:11.940 --> 00:17.060

00:17.140 --> 00:18.620

00:18.700 --> 00:20.500

00:20.580 --> 00:21.900

00:21.980 --> 00:23.740

00:34.100 --> 00:37.780

00:37.860 --> 00:38.980

00:44.900 --> 00:48.420
<i>* I just wanna be... *</i>

00:57.420 --> 01:00.100
Have either of you seen Rita?
She's been gone all morning.

01:00.180 --> 01:01.820
Veridia summoned her.

01:02.300 --> 01:04.140
Sounds official.

01:04.220 --> 01:06.900
The mermaid council want her
advice about taking on the dragon.

01:07.660 --> 01:11.020
The plan is to hit it
with every moon ring in the pod.

01:11.100 --> 01:12.460
That dragon is history.

01:14.620 --> 01:15.740
Really?

01:16.260 --> 01:17.260
What?

01:17.340 --> 01:20.100
Moon rings didn't help my pod.
They won't help yours.

01:20.180 --> 01:23.660
Wow. Thank you for the encouragement.
-I'm just telling you the truth.

01:23.740 --> 01:24.900
Have you got a better idea?

01:24.980 --> 01:26.540
We need to do something
about the dragon.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.020
Mimmi knows a lot of spells.

01:28.660 --> 01:30.100
I... I guess.

01:30.180 --> 01:31.980
Could you trap it in
a deep ocean trench?

01:32.060 --> 01:35.780
Northern mermaids used spells
to trap sharks in ice prisons.

01:35.860 --> 01:37.700
See?
-But this isn't a shark.

01:37.780 --> 01:39.340
It's a magical creature.

01:39.420 --> 01:41.380
So we need something that can trap magic.
-Like?

01:42.820 --> 01:43.900
Like...

01:45.780 --> 01:47.860
a Chinese puzzle box.

01:48.580 --> 01:49.980
I had one when I was little.

01:50.060 --> 01:51.500
We put a containment
spell on them

01:51.580 --> 01:54.540
and used them for trapping rogue
spells and broken enchantments.

01:54.940 --> 01:56.900
How big are these puzzle boxes?

01:56.980 --> 01:58.260
About...

01:59.300 --> 02:00.300
this big.

02:00.380 --> 02:03.500
How are we going to get
a 60-foot dragon inside that?

02:03.580 --> 02:07.980
I could adapt a containment spell, cross
it with a Northern shrinking spell.

02:08.060 --> 02:10.699
Great. We'll get the box
while you work on the spell.

02:10.780 --> 02:12.740
Where are we going to find
a Chinese puzzle box?

02:13.580 --> 02:15.100
I know a good
place we can start.

02:23.020 --> 02:24.740
All set for fishing
this weekend?

02:24.820 --> 02:27.220
7:00 a.m. at the jetty. I'll bring
the rods, you bring the bait.

02:27.820 --> 02:29.700
We went fishing last weekend.

02:29.780 --> 02:31.300
And the weekend before.

02:31.380 --> 02:32.460
And we had a really good time.

02:32.540 --> 02:34.980
And I caught more than you,
as usual.

02:35.060 --> 02:37.340
Fair point.
What about the movies?

02:37.420 --> 02:39.700
I was thinking we could
do something else.

02:40.940 --> 02:41.940
Paintball?

02:42.020 --> 02:43.460
Rock climbing?

02:43.540 --> 02:46.460
I was thinking we could take...

02:46.540 --> 02:47.540
dance classes.

02:50.940 --> 02:52.260
Dancing's not really my thing.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.860
You don't know unless you try.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.740
Guess I'll never know.

02:56.620 --> 02:58.300
Cam.

02:58.380 --> 02:59.380
Please?

03:02.940 --> 03:06.820
They have classes Wednesdays,
Thursdays and Friday nights.

03:10.300 --> 03:11.300
Sounds great.

03:11.380 --> 03:13.340
I knew you'd like it.

03:13.420 --> 03:15.260
Let me know which
night works best.

03:34.460 --> 03:36.340
I love markets.

03:36.420 --> 03:38.220
You can find all kinds of stuff.

03:38.300 --> 03:40.940
Where do we start?
-Mmm...

03:42.540 --> 03:44.420
Let's try there.
And let me do the talking.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.140
That won't be hard.
You don't stop talking.

04:06.860 --> 04:08.780
Spit it out, Cam,

04:08.860 --> 04:11.180
before you scare
away the customers.

04:11.260 --> 04:12.580
It's about Carly.

04:13.740 --> 04:17.339
She wants us to dance...
together.

04:17.420 --> 04:18.459
In public!

04:18.540 --> 04:20.140
That is a great idea!

04:20.220 --> 04:23.420
You two will look so cute together.
-I'll look like a fool.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.700
Couldn't you talk to her?

04:24.780 --> 04:27.860
Maybe...
convince her to drop it?

04:27.940 --> 04:30.740
Cam, you and Carly
are a great couple...

04:31.460 --> 04:33.500
but if you are
serious about her...

04:34.300 --> 04:36.420
you have to put in
a little effort.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.140
Do some of the things
that she likes.

04:39.940 --> 04:42.340
You don't know how
ugly this could get.

04:42.420 --> 04:44.820
When I get on the dance floor,
I'm like...

04:44.900 --> 04:47.380
a force of nature,
but not in a good way.

04:47.460 --> 04:49.700
I'm sure you just need to
spend a little time practicing.

04:49.780 --> 04:52.980
Seriously,
this is not going to end well.

04:53.620 --> 04:54.980
Maybe I could help.

05:18.580 --> 05:19.700
It's Italian leather.

05:19.780 --> 05:21.580
It's a beautiful handbag
and the color really suits you.

05:21.660 --> 05:23.300
No, I do not want a handbag!

05:24.620 --> 05:27.100
Some people
won't take no for an answer.

05:27.180 --> 05:29.780
This has been a complete waste
of an afternoon.

05:29.860 --> 05:31.420
What are you talking about?

05:32.340 --> 05:34.420
I got this dress half price.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.460
I thought we were looking
for a puzzle box.

05:36.540 --> 05:39.380
We are.
-You are. I'm going home.

05:43.620 --> 05:46.340
You were the one who said we had
to do something about the dragon.

05:46.420 --> 05:48.420
Well,
we're not having much luck here.

05:52.380 --> 05:53.740
What about there?

06:22.340 --> 06:24.420
Doesn't look like
they get many customers.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.660
That'll be ten dollar.

06:50.260 --> 06:52.700
And that's just the start
of the bargains.

06:52.780 --> 06:55.500
Whatever you're looking for,
Uncle Shen is here to help.

06:55.580 --> 06:59.460
Perhaps a gift for
family or friends?

06:59.940 --> 07:01.180
Ah!

07:01.260 --> 07:05.620
How about this genuine,
authentic, Chinese jade vase?

07:07.140 --> 07:08.340
Only 20 dollar.

07:09.180 --> 07:10.700
"Made in India"?

07:10.780 --> 07:12.620
Ah! Ugh...

07:12.700 --> 07:14.420
Is anything in here genuine?

07:14.500 --> 07:16.220
I'm as genuine as you get!

07:16.300 --> 07:19.860
And I'm telling you, you cannot
go past this gorgeous fan.

07:20.820 --> 07:24.580
Carved in bamboo from
the forests of Anji.

07:24.660 --> 07:25.700
Keeps you cool.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.140
Let's go, Ondina.

07:28.220 --> 07:30.660
We have a better chance
of finding a puzzle box online.

07:30.740 --> 07:31.740
Wait!

07:32.620 --> 07:34.220
You want puzzle box?

07:34.300 --> 07:36.820
Why not say so?

07:36.900 --> 07:38.980
Today is your lucky day.

07:41.620 --> 07:44.460
I do not show this
to any old tourist.

07:44.540 --> 07:47.180
But... I can see you're special.

07:51.180 --> 07:52.940
Very fine box.

07:53.020 --> 07:55.100
Hand carved teak.

07:55.180 --> 07:58.140
About 50 year old.
-It's beautiful.

08:01.140 --> 08:05.620
Not many young people
know about puzzle box.

08:05.700 --> 08:06.900
Why do you want it?

08:06.980 --> 08:08.700
Because...

08:08.780 --> 08:13.020
we really like puzzles.
-Oh.

08:13.100 --> 08:14.460
And boxes.

08:16.300 --> 08:18.660
Mmm. I like you girls.

08:18.740 --> 08:20.740
Uh... I make you special price.

08:20.820 --> 08:23.580
Sixty dollar. Best price.

08:23.660 --> 08:27.060
Sixty is your best price?
I'll give you 20.

08:27.140 --> 08:31.100
Twenty? How do I put
food on table for 20?

08:31.180 --> 08:32.500
Fifty-five.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.539
Thirty, including the teapot
my friend broke.

08:34.620 --> 08:37.100
No deal.

08:38.299 --> 08:40.500
Come on. We're going!

08:41.299 --> 08:43.020
What are you doing?
- Keep walking!

08:43.940 --> 08:46.100
Okay, okay. Sold.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.860
You girls be careful.

08:54.940 --> 08:58.380
That box is not a toy.
It is dangerous.

08:59.820 --> 09:02.180
One time,
I got my finger caught.

09:02.260 --> 09:04.780
Box was stuck on my
hand for three hour.

09:08.140 --> 09:10.260
We should go.
-Thanks.

09:11.340 --> 09:14.620
Come back anytime.
More deals coming any day.

09:16.420 --> 09:19.140
We got it!
At a bargain price, too.

09:19.220 --> 09:22.460
It looks a bit flimsy.
-Oh, trust me. It'll do the job.

09:47.260 --> 09:48.820
Okay, Cam, you're up.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.980
Give it everything you've got.

09:51.060 --> 09:53.300
Well, if you can do it,
it can't be that hard.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.820
Okay, now take my hands.

09:55.900 --> 09:58.140
The basic steps
of salsa are easy.

09:58.220 --> 10:00.500
It's a forward-back shuffle
over eight counts.

10:01.140 --> 10:04.140
Now... watch my feet. Okay?

10:04.620 --> 10:06.660
One, two, three...

10:06.740 --> 10:08.260
five, six, seven.

10:08.340 --> 10:10.540
Now copy. One, two, three...

10:10.620 --> 10:11.860
five, six, seven.

10:11.940 --> 10:14.020
What about four and eight?
-Uh, you don't count them.

10:15.060 --> 10:17.660
Hold on. Just...
start with the simple version.

10:17.740 --> 10:20.580
That was the simple version.

10:22.780 --> 10:25.180
Okay, let's just try this again.
Okay?

10:25.260 --> 10:26.300
You count.

10:26.380 --> 10:27.780
Okay.

10:27.860 --> 10:29.420
And one, two, three,

10:29.500 --> 10:30.860
five, six, seven...

10:30.940 --> 10:32.780
I can't open it.

10:32.860 --> 10:36.140
It's a puzzle box. It's supposed
to be difficult to open.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.700
Once magic is trapped inside,
you don't want it getting out.

10:56.460 --> 10:58.700
Okay,
once I put the spell on the box,

10:58.780 --> 11:01.820
anything magical that comes
close will be sucked inside.

11:01.900 --> 11:03.260
That's if you've
got the spell right.

11:04.020 --> 11:05.860
Don't worry, Mimmi's a genius.

11:05.940 --> 11:06.940
Do it.

11:18.860 --> 11:20.540
How do we know if it's worked?

11:20.620 --> 11:21.620
Watch.

11:21.700 --> 11:24.180
Imagine this water's the dragon.

11:24.260 --> 11:26.860
When I bring it
close to the box...

11:26.940 --> 11:27.980
Bye-bye, dragon.

11:32.260 --> 11:35.700
Or, you have a wet puzzle box.

11:38.980 --> 11:40.580
<i>...five, six, seven,</i>

11:40.660 --> 11:42.340
one, two, three, and twirl.

11:43.300 --> 11:44.460
Ow!
-Sorry.

11:44.540 --> 11:46.020
Evie, I should just
quit while I'm behind.

11:46.100 --> 11:49.700
No, no, no, no. No, just keep at
it. You'll get better. I promise.

11:49.780 --> 11:52.340
Evie and I had to practice for weeks
before the school dance last year.

11:52.420 --> 11:53.860
Yeah.
-Look, what's the point?

11:54.580 --> 11:56.460
Thanks for your help,
but this is a waste of time.

11:56.540 --> 11:57.540
You're overthinking it.

11:58.380 --> 11:59.620
Salsa is just like walking.

11:59.700 --> 12:02.340
Uh, if it was just like walking,
I could do it.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.620
What was Carly thinking?

12:04.700 --> 12:06.700
This is supposed to
help our relationship?

12:06.780 --> 12:08.540
What a stupid idea.

12:11.140 --> 12:12.300
She's behind me, isn't she?

12:17.060 --> 12:19.660
Carly, I didn't mean...

12:19.740 --> 12:21.060
Carly.

12:21.660 --> 12:22.980
Carly, wait!

12:24.940 --> 12:27.780
Maybe the spell
needs more power to take effect?

12:28.820 --> 12:30.140
Ondina.

12:52.780 --> 12:54.780
Was that supposed to happen?

12:54.860 --> 12:55.860
I don't know.

12:57.220 --> 12:58.660
Let's see if it worked.

13:10.820 --> 13:16.700
So what we have is an authentic,
hand-crafted, useless Chinese puzzle box.

13:16.780 --> 13:19.900
Maybe it needs more time to work.
-No, it should have worked right away.

13:19.980 --> 13:23.060
I need food.
Failure always makes me hungry.

13:41.860 --> 13:42.900
Hi, Carly.

13:45.140 --> 13:47.620
What I said today,
I can explain.

13:47.700 --> 13:48.700
Forget it.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.300
Okay. So we're all good?

13:54.340 --> 13:55.340
I'll take that as a no.

13:57.780 --> 14:01.060
Listen, what I said earlier,
I didn't mean it.

14:02.140 --> 14:03.140
Really?

14:03.220 --> 14:05.900
Of course not.
I never mean what I say.

14:05.980 --> 14:07.180
Hmm.

14:07.260 --> 14:08.620
I didn't mean that either.

14:08.700 --> 14:11.540
Look, what do I have to do to not
be in trouble with you anymore?

14:12.140 --> 14:13.660
So you want to get off the hook?

14:13.740 --> 14:15.540
That'd be nice.

14:15.620 --> 14:16.620
Fine.

14:17.540 --> 14:19.060
You don't have to apologize.

14:19.980 --> 14:21.660
You don't have to dance.

14:21.740 --> 14:24.220
You don't even have to be
in this relationship anymore.

14:25.300 --> 14:26.380
You're off the hook...

14:27.860 --> 14:29.100
permanently.

15:20.900 --> 15:23.220
Planning on getting a refund?

15:23.300 --> 15:24.940
I'm going to ask Rita about it.

15:25.020 --> 15:26.700
You're flogging a dead seahorse.

15:30.060 --> 15:31.460
Morning, girls.

15:31.540 --> 15:32.940
Has anyone seen Poseidon?

15:33.580 --> 15:35.420
Not since yesterday.
-That's odd.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.580
He never misses breakfast.

15:37.660 --> 15:40.220
I really have to run.
Can you look for him?

15:40.300 --> 15:41.580
Of course.

15:41.660 --> 15:43.300
Oh, Rita,
can I ask you something?

15:43.380 --> 15:44.820
I'm sorry. I really have to go.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.780
Um, see me at school,
after the staff meeting.

15:46.860 --> 15:47.940
Okay.

15:54.660 --> 15:57.180
Can anyone tell me
the basic principles

15:57.260 --> 16:00.140
of Newton's Third Law of Motion?

16:00.220 --> 16:01.420
Anyone?

16:03.140 --> 16:05.580
Anyone?

16:05.660 --> 16:10.100
"For every action there is an
equal and opposite reaction."

16:10.180 --> 16:13.540
Eyes to the board, please.
Copy down this formula.

16:35.220 --> 16:37.460
Am I boring you?

16:39.860 --> 16:41.300
What is that?

16:41.780 --> 16:43.060
A Chinese puzzle box.

16:43.140 --> 16:48.820
And would you care to tell the class
how it relates to Newton's Third Law?

16:50.260 --> 16:52.420
I didn't think so.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.300
You can collect this
at the end of the day.

17:05.020 --> 17:07.020
Poseidon?

17:07.099 --> 17:08.859
Where are you, furball?

17:09.859 --> 17:13.180
I can't find him anywhere.
-He can't have just disappeared.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.980
Where's the puzzle box?

17:18.060 --> 17:19.980
Weilan took it to school.

17:22.940 --> 17:24.380
You don't think...

17:28.460 --> 17:31.260
I did not follow a word of that.

17:31.340 --> 17:33.620
I think it had something to do
with the laws of attraction.

17:33.700 --> 17:36.220
That's something
Cam would never understand.

17:38.860 --> 17:41.820
Uh, wanna get a bite to eat?
-Sure.

18:24.860 --> 18:26.140
Ms. Trumble's in there?

18:27.540 --> 18:29.140
That little box?

18:29.220 --> 18:31.860
We have to get her out before
anyone notices she's gone.

18:32.780 --> 18:34.700
Don't touch it!
-Why?

18:34.780 --> 18:36.900
You could get sucked
in there with her.

18:39.060 --> 18:40.300
Weilan!

18:40.380 --> 18:42.260
-The box works.

18:42.340 --> 18:45.180
I know. It took our teacher.

18:45.260 --> 18:47.180
Well, isn't that just wonderful.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.100
It's supposed to only trap
magical creatures.

18:49.180 --> 18:51.260
Obviously,
no one told the box that.

18:51.340 --> 18:52.460
How do we get her out?

18:52.540 --> 18:54.860
Mimmi can reverse the spell
on the box. Right, Mimmi?

18:54.940 --> 18:56.740
Slight problem.

18:56.820 --> 18:58.500
It's irreversible.

18:58.580 --> 19:02.020
So this box is randomly
vacuuming up teachers and cats,

19:02.100 --> 19:03.780
and we can't do anything about it?
-Wait, cats?

19:04.460 --> 19:05.580
We think it took Poseidon.

19:05.660 --> 19:08.700
Ms. Trumble's in there with Poseidon?
-Poor Poseidon.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.180
Oh.
-Can we please just focus.

19:10.260 --> 19:11.820
We need to get them out.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.980
The spell's on the box,
not what's inside,

19:14.060 --> 19:17.580
so if we open the box, whatever's
inside should come out.

19:17.660 --> 19:20.940
But... no one can touch the box
in case they get sucked in.

19:21.020 --> 19:23.340
What if we break it open?
-With a spell?

19:23.420 --> 19:24.420
With a hammer.

19:24.500 --> 19:27.100
But we went through a lot of
trouble getting it to work.

19:29.420 --> 19:30.700
What are you doing?

19:31.380 --> 19:33.260
Where's Ms. Trumble?
She's late for a meeting.

19:33.900 --> 19:36.020
Promise you won't yell.

19:38.860 --> 19:40.260
What are you doing?

19:40.340 --> 19:43.220
No! Don't... Weilan! No!

19:53.780 --> 19:56.180
There you are, boy.

19:56.260 --> 19:57.980
Thank you for finding him.

19:58.700 --> 19:59.860
What...

19:59.940 --> 20:02.700
Come along... Ms. Trumble.

20:02.780 --> 20:04.340
The staff meeting
can't wait forever.

20:04.420 --> 20:05.660
Staff meeting?
-Mmm.

20:05.740 --> 20:07.620
Oh, right, of course,

20:07.700 --> 20:09.820
Principal Santos. Right away.
- Bye...

20:09.900 --> 20:11.380
You'll explain this later.

20:14.860 --> 20:16.900
Hmm.
-So...

20:16.980 --> 20:19.620
who's going to take it home?

20:23.460 --> 20:24.540
Fine.

20:29.460 --> 20:32.500
Luckily for you, Ms. Trumble
has no memory of what happened.

20:34.140 --> 20:37.460
I know you meant well,
but you must be more careful.

20:37.540 --> 20:40.740
Adapting spells
makes them highly volatile.

20:40.820 --> 20:44.180
Even if it could trap the
dragon, it's far too dangerous.

20:55.340 --> 20:58.660
You must admit... it works.

20:58.740 --> 21:01.140
Yeah... a little too well.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.300
We can't use it.

21:03.380 --> 21:06.060
Like Rita said, it's too random.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.380
It could trap any of us.

21:08.540 --> 21:11.220
What do you suggest
we do with it?

21:12.940 --> 21:14.260
Poseidon!

21:21.260 --> 21:24.060
Does that answer your question?

21:34.780 --> 21:36.060
Hey, Cam.

21:37.300 --> 21:40.940
I need your help.
-Sure.

21:41.020 --> 21:42.940
What's up?

22:09.300 --> 22:11.420
What's this?

22:11.500 --> 22:13.060
I've been rude...

22:13.500 --> 22:15.260
and insensitive...

22:15.340 --> 22:16.820
and arrogant.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.500
And uncaring.

22:18.580 --> 22:20.540
Yes, all of the above.

22:20.620 --> 22:22.740
The point is...

22:22.820 --> 22:24.300
I'm in this with you.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.340
So what do you say?

22:28.500 --> 22:29.660
Shall we dance?

22:44.020 --> 22:45.300
Wow.

22:45.380 --> 22:47.700
I'm impressed. How did you
learn to dance so well?

22:47.780 --> 22:49.420
Guess I'm just
naturally talented.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.740
Turn and turn, now turn, turn... Oh!
-Okay, I'm trying, I'm trying.

22:51.820 --> 22:53.940
Turn, one, two, three.
Good, good.

22:54.020 --> 22:56.140
You know, this isn't that bad.

22:56.220 --> 22:57.700
I knew you'd like it.

22:57.780 --> 22:59.460
You know me so well.

22:59.540 --> 23:00.700
Don't forget hips, okay?
-...five, six...

23:00.780 --> 23:03.940
And across.
-...two, three, five, six, seven.

23:08.980 --> 23:10.420
<i>* In this world *</i>

23:10.500 --> 23:12.060
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

23:12.140 --> 23:15.460

23:15.540 --> 23:17.260
