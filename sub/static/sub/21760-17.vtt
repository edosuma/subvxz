The $10,000
House of de Vil Sweepstakes!

01:29.330 --> 01:31.000
That's right, Ed.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.380
Today some lucky little peon
will walk away

01:33.380 --> 01:36.000
with more money
than they deserve.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.880
Plus a year's supply

01:37.880 --> 01:41.000
of my new silky soft
hairspray,

01:41.000 --> 01:43.210
Cruella Sheen!

01:47.000 --> 01:48.960
-Oh!

01:48.960 --> 01:52.250
Plus don't miss
the fair's special guest star,

01:52.250 --> 01:55.830
Thunderbolt the Wonder Dog!

01:55.830 --> 01:57.500
All:
Whoa!

01:57.500 --> 02:00.920
Oh, man!
I can't wait
to meet Thunderbolt.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.420
I hear he dyes his muzzle.

02:03.420 --> 02:06.750
Is Nanny ready to go yet?

02:06.750 --> 02:09.170
I don't want to miss
the pie-eating contest.

02:09.170 --> 02:13.290
I've been practicing
all week.

02:21.710 --> 02:26.500
Personally, I'm drawn
to the symbolic journey
of the roller coaster,

02:26.500 --> 02:31.040
carrying you through
life's ups and downs

02:31.040 --> 02:32.580
till you puke.

02:32.580 --> 02:35.080
Ha! You won't catch me
anywhere near

02:35.080 --> 02:37.250
those dolled-up death traps.

02:37.250 --> 02:40.880
Do you know how many people
are maimed every year

02:40.880 --> 02:42.920
on merry
Ah!

02:42.920 --> 02:44.080
Uh, none?

02:44.080 --> 02:47.960
Exactly!
A tragedy is long overdue.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.500
Hmm.
More to the left.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.000
More to the left!
More to the left.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.080
More to the left!
More to the left.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.080
No, that's not right.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.380
Good news, Miss de Vil.

03:04.380 --> 03:06.580
I sold every last
sweepstakes ticket.

03:06.580 --> 03:08.880
-Excellent, little man!
-Let me say,

03:08.880 --> 03:11.960
I think you're doing
a fine, upstanding thing

03:11.960 --> 03:14.920
by giving away
all that money
to some lucky winner.

03:16.920 --> 03:19.330
Listen, darling,
the lucky winner

03:19.330 --> 03:21.540
of the grand prize
shall be,

03:21.540 --> 03:24.670
by remarkable coincidence,
me!

03:24.670 --> 03:26.540
You, ma'am?

03:26.540 --> 03:27.710
Exactly.

03:31.750 --> 03:35.920
Cruella:
With my lucky ticket #202.

03:35.920 --> 03:39.040
You did remember not to sell
ticket #202, didn't you?

03:39.040 --> 03:41.120
Well...

03:44.040 --> 03:48.830
-Oh, my lucky number.
202!

03:48.830 --> 03:50.380
What?

03:50.380 --> 03:54.670
You sold my winning ticket
to that doggy den mother?

03:54.670 --> 03:56.960
Get it back!
You understand?

03:56.960 --> 03:58.830
Now!

03:58.830 --> 04:01.790
Come on, guys.
The bus is leaving.

04:01.790 --> 04:04.460
Just a sec.
This is the best part.

04:04.460 --> 04:07.580
Where Thunderbolt parachutes
behind enemy lines,

04:07.580 --> 04:09.880
disguised as a Pekingese.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.960
93, 94, 95...
Wait, wait.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.920
Didn't you already go--
aw!

04:15.920 --> 04:19.830
Uh, 41, 42, 4--

04:21.210 --> 04:23.750
Mwah!

04:25.750 --> 04:28.000
Well, I guess
that's everybody.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.380
All:
Yay!

04:39.380 --> 04:42.000
Hey, come on, guys.
We don't want to miss the bus.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.960
We missed the b-b-bus.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.210
Aw, man!

04:48.210 --> 04:49.750
No pie.

04:49.750 --> 04:51.830
No thrill rides.

04:51.830 --> 04:53.880
No Thunderbolt.

04:58.120 --> 05:01.250
Hey! Nanny dropped
her sweepstakes ticket.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.920
That settles it.

05:02.920 --> 05:05.420
We'll just
have to go to the fair
and take it to her.

05:05.420 --> 05:07.830
I hate this idea already.

05:13.250 --> 05:16.500
Now according
to my calculations,

05:16.500 --> 05:20.250
the only truly statistically
safe ride is...

05:20.250 --> 05:21.920
the turnstile.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.880
Aw, Lucky,
are we there yet?

05:24.880 --> 05:27.380
I'm getting awful hungry.

05:27.380 --> 05:30.330
I don't recognize any of this.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.750
Hey, trust me.

05:31.750 --> 05:35.500
The fair is right down--
or, uh...

05:35.500 --> 05:36.750
Maybe that one?

05:36.750 --> 05:38.170
Or that one?

05:38.170 --> 05:41.880
Ah! We're lost!
I knew it!

05:41.880 --> 05:44.000
Doomed, doomed!

05:44.000 --> 05:48.210
Oh, just one more chicken
on a milk carton.

05:53.790 --> 05:55.670
Hey, Jasper,

05:55.670 --> 05:57.960
ain't that some of them
cute little puppies?

05:57.960 --> 05:59.790
Forget the pups.

05:59.790 --> 06:02.040
We got to find
that ticket.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.750
Hiya, puppies.

06:03.750 --> 06:05.830
Nice ticket.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.170
Hello, doggies.

06:14.170 --> 06:16.670
How's about a lift?

06:16.670 --> 06:20.710
Now why don't you just hand
that little ticket over

06:20.710 --> 06:22.790
to old Uncle Jasper here?
Huh?

06:22.790 --> 06:25.000
-Yeeaaah!

06:27.040 --> 06:28.830
-Hey!

06:52.750 --> 06:55.620
Spot:
O-o-oh, I think
I f-f-froze

06:55.620 --> 06:57.580
my gib-gib-giblets.

06:57.580 --> 06:59.830
Hey, ch-ch-chill out.

06:59.830 --> 07:03.420
I just kn-know we're getting
c-c-closer to the fair.

07:03.420 --> 07:06.670
Now c-c-come on.

07:06.670 --> 07:09.620
Oh, we're never going
to get to the fair.

07:09.620 --> 07:12.830
Um, Lucky, where's Rolly?

07:12.830 --> 07:16.380
Ooh, pie!

07:16.380 --> 07:18.670
Oh, no!

07:18.670 --> 07:21.040
-Here they are.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.960
Yippee!

07:25.960 --> 07:28.580
Lucky:
Rolly!

07:33.080 --> 07:35.460
The ticket!

07:35.460 --> 07:37.620
All:
Yikes!

08:04.920 --> 08:06.210
All:
Ahhh!

08:06.210 --> 08:09.830
Spot:
Just like a roller coaster!

08:09.830 --> 08:14.040
All:
Yay! Whoo! Ha!

09:04.670 --> 09:07.880
All:
Whoo! Ha!

09:09.920 --> 09:13.170
Hey!
Stop eating my pie!

09:15.920 --> 09:18.830
Thanks!
-Hey!

09:23.880 --> 09:26.080
Both:
Yah!

09:37.120 --> 09:41.750
-Spot: Ah! Just like
a Ferris wheel!

10:03.000 --> 10:05.620
Folks, the big moment
has come.

10:05.620 --> 10:08.210
Here to draw
the winning ticket

10:08.210 --> 10:09.920
for $10,000

10:09.920 --> 10:13.330
and a year's supply
of Cruella Sheen hairspray,

10:13.330 --> 10:17.420
our special guest,
Thunderbolt P.I.!

10:18.620 --> 10:20.710
Where are those bumpkins?

10:23.120 --> 10:25.580
-Sorry, ma'am, no brakes!

10:28.920 --> 10:31.250
And the winner is...

10:31.250 --> 10:34.170
Man:
Goat stampede!

10:44.880 --> 10:48.420
#202.

10:48.420 --> 10:52.120
Oh! That's me!
That's me!

10:52.120 --> 10:54.920
I won! Oh!

10:57.420 --> 11:01.580
Thu

11:02.790 --> 11:05.670
Rolly:
Well, at least Lucky
got to meet Thunderbolt.

11:05.670 --> 11:08.500
Even if we did miss the fair.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.380
Miss the fair?

11:10.380 --> 11:12.620
Miss the fair!

11:12.620 --> 11:15.040
Why, we spent the whole day

11:15.040 --> 11:18.380
at that big shiny fair
called life!

11:18.380 --> 11:22.210
The roller-coaster ride
in the pie factory.

11:22.210 --> 11:24.960
All the pies
I could eat!

11:24.960 --> 11:28.080
The bumper buckets
and the Ferris water wheel.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.580
And I didn't even get hurt.

11:43.380 --> 11:45.540
Man on TV:
Correct me if I'm wrong,

11:45.540 --> 11:47.330
but ever since
that thing landed,

11:47.330 --> 11:49.830
strange, inexplicable events
have occurred--

11:49.830 --> 11:53.710
events which
cannot be explained
in normal, scientific terms.

11:53.710 --> 11:56.540
Something has happened
here in Happy Town--

11:56.540 --> 11:59.120
something evil.

11:59.120 --> 12:01.460
Evil? Gah!

12:01.460 --> 12:04.380
Hey! Will you chill out?

12:04.380 --> 12:06.420
-I'm chilled, I'm chilled.
-Shh!

12:06.420 --> 12:10.250
Call me crazy,
but I'm beginning to suspect

12:10.250 --> 12:13.380
the good people of this town
have changed.

12:13.380 --> 12:15.380
-Ahh!

12:15.380 --> 12:17.330
Ooh! Oh, no!

12:17.330 --> 12:20.380
They're living in Freaky Town!

12:20.380 --> 12:24.420
I wonder,
can we remain calm?

12:24.420 --> 12:27.670
Hey, who's not calm?

12:27.670 --> 12:30.210
We've got to get out
of here, Sheila,

12:30.210 --> 12:33.000
before we become
slime-sucking space aliens.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.290
-Ahh!

12:34.290 --> 12:36.210
Ah!

12:36.210 --> 12:39.380
-Cadpig: She did it again.

12:39.380 --> 12:41.380
I'll get the crowbar.

12:41.380 --> 12:43.670
Chicken:
You, high

12:43.670 --> 12:46.540
I've never heard
anything so preposterous.

12:46.540 --> 12:48.830
B-b-but that's what
the pups all say.

12:48.830 --> 12:53.210
You're calmer and cooler
than any chicken in this coop.

12:53.210 --> 12:55.790
-Ahhh!

12:55.790 --> 12:58.290
Okay, so maybe you're not.

12:58.290 --> 13:00.460
But you're
an excellent dancer

13:00.460 --> 13:02.710
and that's got to count
for something.

13:07.380 --> 13:11.120
I guess they're right
about me.

13:11.120 --> 13:15.000
Look, Spot,
don't worry about what
the other species say,

13:15.000 --> 13:16.500
even the pups.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.580
One day,
you're their best friend

13:18.580 --> 13:20.580
and the next day,
you're their entree.

13:20.580 --> 13:24.250
Pleasant dreams.

13:30.580 --> 13:33.210
Nah.
Not my friends.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.290
Lucky's right.
I do get hysterical
over nothing.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.920
From now on,
I'm going to relax,

13:54.920 --> 13:58.250
kick back,
take time to smell
the earthworms.

14:00.170 --> 14:02.250
Huh?

14:07.210 --> 14:09.540
Hey, guys, it's me!

14:14.120 --> 14:17.040
That's funny.
I've never been
locked out before.

14:17.040 --> 14:19.040
Oh, hi.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.420
Hiya, Cadpig.
Wanna go swimming?

14:21.420 --> 14:25.250
Um, ooh, no can do.

14:25.250 --> 14:27.420
Hey! Hmm.

14:27.420 --> 14:30.830
Lucky!
How about you?

14:30.830 --> 14:33.330
Uh, I got plans.

14:33.330 --> 14:36.540
Uh, Rolly,
feel like a meal?

14:36.540 --> 14:39.920
Sorry.
Not hungry.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.000
Huh?

14:41.000 --> 14:44.540
Rolly not hungry?
Impossible!

14:44.540 --> 14:46.170
Weird, huh?

14:46.170 --> 14:49.920
Actually, they're all acting
a little strange.

14:49.920 --> 14:52.290
Strange is not good.

14:52.290 --> 14:54.210
Aw, they're probably
still peeved

14:54.210 --> 14:56.540
'cause of the holes
I put in their ceiling.

14:56.540 --> 14:58.670
I'm sure they'll be all right
in a day or two.

14:58.670 --> 15:02.170
Maybe.
Maybe not.

15:02.170 --> 15:03.330
Who are you?

15:03.330 --> 15:07.170
Sal is the name.
And it's time you woke up

15:07.170 --> 15:08.460
and smelled the kibble.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.250
1973--

15:24.250 --> 15:28.330
crop circles appear
in Farmer Fredley's north 40.

15:28.330 --> 15:31.290
A Golden Retriever
refuses to fetch.

15:31.290 --> 15:34.500
Hours later,
three pullets disappear.

15:34.500 --> 15:38.080
Coincidence?
I think not!

15:38.080 --> 15:39.830
1984--

15:39.830 --> 15:43.170
strange lights
seen over a coop
in northern Minnesota.

15:43.170 --> 15:44.960
Soon afterwards,

15:44.960 --> 15:47.330
a Mexican Hairless
grows a beard.

15:47.330 --> 15:51.710
Two weeks later, four hens
spontaneously combust.

15:51.710 --> 15:55.250
Accident?
You be the judge.

15:55.250 --> 15:59.960
1996-- a conical object
flies through frame.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.620
Dalmatians snub
local chicken.

16:02.620 --> 16:06.170
A strange slide projector
appears from nowhere.

16:06.170 --> 16:10.670
Isolated incidents,
or part of a larger pattern?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.420
Aw, cut it out!

16:17.420 --> 16:19.210
This is silly.

16:19.210 --> 16:21.880
Let your paranoid friend
finish, dear.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.420
There is only
one logical answer.

16:24.420 --> 16:28.250
The reason your puppy pals
scoff at space monsters

16:28.250 --> 16:32.750
is because they have become
space monsters themselves!

16:32.750 --> 16:36.830
I have never heard
anything so ridiculous
in all my life!

16:36.830 --> 16:38.120
Oh, yeah?

16:38.120 --> 16:42.460
Then how do you explain that?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Yep,
that was definitely made

16:47.000 --> 16:50.120
by a UFO-ish type
space-traveling vehicle.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.920
Now how do you know that?

16:51.920 --> 16:54.790
'Cause I'm an expert!

16:54.790 --> 16:56.500
I want a second opinion.

16:56.500 --> 16:59.080
Okay, you got it.

17:10.080 --> 17:13.380
You'll have to excuse Steven.
He's been abducted.

17:13.380 --> 17:17.000
And it might happen to us.
That's why we must find out

17:17.000 --> 17:21.380
if the Dalmatians
have been turned into aliens.

17:21.380 --> 17:23.210
Hey, I got just the thing!

17:23.210 --> 17:26.380
This is a comprehensive manual
detailing the characteristics

17:26.380 --> 17:28.540
of the slime-sucking
little critters.

17:28.540 --> 17:31.290
That'll be $39.95,
plus tax.

17:31.290 --> 17:33.290
We'll take it.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.710
Why don't we just ask them?

17:36.710 --> 17:38.290
Because it says here

17:38.290 --> 17:41.080
that aliens
are notorious liars.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.710
"Question one--
Are the subjects engaged

17:43.710 --> 17:47.040
in super"

17:55.080 --> 17:57.460
-Uh-oh.

17:57.460 --> 17:59.880
"Question two--

17:59.880 --> 18:04.920
Do the subjects speak
in a weird alien"

18:04.920 --> 18:07.080
Is it ready?
We're nearly done.

18:07.080 --> 18:10.750
Maybe it's laryngitis.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.000
"Question three--

18:12.000 --> 18:15.170
Can the subjects defy
the earth's gravity?"

18:15.170 --> 18:18.960
Sweet Georgia Brown!

18:18.960 --> 18:22.170
It's a full-scale invasion!

18:22.170 --> 18:24.080
First the bad news.

18:24.080 --> 18:28.290
As I suspected,
the dogs have indeed
been turned into aliens.

18:28.290 --> 18:32.960
(all muttering,
squealing)

18:32.960 --> 18:34.960
And now the good news.

18:34.960 --> 18:38.120
I managed to find a ride
for every bird who wants out.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.670
We'll be leaving
in the morning.

18:40.670 --> 18:42.920
If you want to go,
pack your things.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.750
And above all,
remain calm.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.420
All right, ladies.

18:47.420 --> 18:50.380
Don't just stand there.
Panic!

19:03.250 --> 19:06.120
-Everybody stop!

19:06.120 --> 19:07.790
What are we, nuts?

19:07.790 --> 19:11.080
These are our friends.
They're not aliens.

19:11.080 --> 19:15.790
And if they are aliens,
I want to hear it from them.

19:15.790 --> 19:18.420
All right!
What are you going to do?

19:18.420 --> 19:21.290
Walk up to the barn
with a casserole and smile

19:21.290 --> 19:25.080
and say,
"Hi, are you guys aliens?"

19:25.080 --> 19:27.880
Hi.
Are you guys aliens?

19:35.920 --> 19:37.250
Anybody home?

19:37.250 --> 19:41.500
Eh, it's me--
your old pal Spot.

19:41.500 --> 19:44.500
-Ahh!

19:44.500 --> 19:47.580
Uh, olly olly oxen free!

19:47.580 --> 19:50.960
See?
No aliens.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.880
No space ship.

19:52.880 --> 19:56.210
Just an ominously dark barn.

19:59.380 --> 20:02.500
-Spot!

20:02.500 --> 20:05.080
Ahh!

20:05.080 --> 20:07.880
Spot?
-Ahhh!

20:12.920 --> 20:14.580
Hey, Spot!

20:20.830 --> 20:23.460
I'm warning you--
I know karate!

20:23.460 --> 20:24.710
Spot!

20:24.710 --> 20:26.880
Okay, so maybe
I don't know karate.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.500
But I'm an excellent dancer.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.040
And that's got to count
for something.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.330
-All: Spot!

20:37.330 --> 20:41.540
You slime-sucking aliens
ate my friends!

20:41.540 --> 20:43.790
And no one eats my pals,

20:43.790 --> 20:48.040
not without dealing
with me! Ahhh!

20:48.040 --> 20:49.880
-Spot: Ow.

20:49.880 --> 20:53.500
Calm down, you maniac.
It's us.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.170
But--

20:55.170 --> 20:57.120
you're--
you're all green.

20:57.120 --> 21:00.000
It's just paint.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.380
For your surprise.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.170
We made it so you wouldn't
have to walk home

21:07.170 --> 21:09.500
after Mystery
Creepizoid Theater.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.210
B-b-but you were floating
in the--

21:11.210 --> 21:14.040
Spot, you gotta try this!

21:14.040 --> 21:18.750
-But you were
talking all-- all--
-Ahem.

21:18.750 --> 21:21.790
Oh, so you guys weren't--
you mean, you're not--

21:21.790 --> 21:25.500
you're-- oh, boy.

21:25.500 --> 21:29.080
Man!
She has got to learn
to calm down.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.880
You see?

21:30.880 --> 21:33.540
There was absolutely
no reason to be paranoid.

21:33.540 --> 21:36.830
From now on,
I think we should
all just relax.

21:36.830 --> 21:39.420
Words to live by.

21:39.420 --> 21:42.420
Come on, gals!
The seed's on me.

21:45.920 --> 21:49.170
Don't feel bad, dear.
It was a lovely panic.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.460
Scout One to Mother Ship.

21:56.460 --> 21:58.460
Male voice:
Mother Ship here.

21:58.460 --> 22:01.290
Are the chickens
ready for transport?

22:01.290 --> 22:04.790
Negative.
But I did get something
much better.

22:04.790 --> 22:07.380
Not again.
