Falcon one, do we have a go?

00:05.301 --> 00:07.250
The light is green, tiger one.

00:07.251 --> 00:08.967
What are you gonna say when
you crash through the window?

00:08.968 --> 00:11.132
Hey, there,
sorry for dropping in.

00:11.133 --> 00:13.467
Goose bumps, Jake.
Goose bumps.

00:13.468 --> 00:14.802
- Is the equipment secure?
- Check.

00:14.803 --> 00:15.836
- Weapon loaded?
- Check.

00:15.837 --> 00:16.903
Did you have breakfast?

00:16.938 --> 00:18.304
What?
That's not on the checklist.

00:18.340 --> 00:19.740
I added it
because I care about you.

00:19.775 --> 00:21.842
- No, I did not have breakfast.
- Unacceptable.

00:21.843 --> 00:23.309
<i>Look in your pocket.</i>

00:23.345 --> 00:24.811
Hey, there's little
chocolate chips in this.

00:24.846 --> 00:26.113
Yeah, I'm not an idiot.
I know how

00:26.114 --> 00:27.781
to trick my best friend
into eating his fiber.

00:27.816 --> 00:31.084
All right, bar digested.

It felt really cool.

Yeah, it was pretty cool.

01:10.859 --> 01:13.259
So I smash through the window,
feet first.

01:13.295 --> 01:15.496
There's glass everywhere,
and I say,

01:15.497 --> 01:17.932
"Hey, there,
sorry for dropping in."

01:17.933 --> 01:19.265
- Ho!
- Whoa.

01:19.301 --> 01:20.967
And the best part is,
there was nothing on my cheek.

01:21.002 --> 01:22.368
That's a weird detail
to throw in there.

01:22.404 --> 01:23.803
You're a weird detail
to throw in there.

01:23.839 --> 01:25.205
- Hmm? What?
- Wait a second, Peralta.

01:25.240 --> 01:27.307
You busted through a window
for no reason?

01:27.342 --> 01:29.709
Basic police tactic, Sarge.
Cover every exit.

01:29.745 --> 01:31.678
It was a sealed window
on the fifth floor.

01:31.713 --> 01:33.673
You could have just
gone in the door with Charles.

01:33.682 --> 01:35.750
Yeah, but then what would
my catchphrase have been?

01:35.751 --> 01:37.318
"Knock, knock, who's there?
Justice"?

01:37.319 --> 01:38.452
Ooh, that's actually amazing.

01:38.453 --> 01:39.720
- Charles, write that down.
- Already did.

01:39.721 --> 01:41.321
Sarge, what's the big deal?

01:41.356 --> 01:43.457
We stopped two kilos of heroin
from hitting the streets.

01:43.458 --> 01:44.558
Who cares about
one broken window?

01:44.559 --> 01:46.026
I do!

01:46.027 --> 01:48.028
I'm the one who has to spend
all weekend doing paperwork

01:48.029 --> 01:49.162
because of your dumb stunt.

01:49.197 --> 01:51.631
But...
Terry loves paperwork?

01:51.666 --> 01:54.168
- No, Jake, I do not.
- Oh.

01:54.169 --> 01:58.304
Look, man, I've got two kids,
a job, and a very pregnant wife.

01:58.340 --> 02:00.808
I get one hour a week
to myself on Sundays.

02:00.809 --> 02:01.975
You know what I do
with that time?

02:02.010 --> 02:05.079
I run a hot bubble bath,
wheel in a TV,

02:05.080 --> 02:06.479
and watch sports bloopers.

02:06.515 --> 02:07.847
Sports bloopers?

02:07.883 --> 02:09.282
They're hilarious and relaxing,

02:09.283 --> 02:10.851
and they humanize my heroes.

02:10.852 --> 02:12.820
Okay, well, I went
through a window.

02:12.821 --> 02:13.954
That's a blooper of sorts,
right?

02:13.955 --> 02:15.189
No!

02:15.190 --> 02:16.589
It's not a blooper
if you meant to do it!

02:16.625 --> 02:19.493
Thanks for ruining my weekend.

02:19.494 --> 02:21.328
This is a debacle.

02:21.329 --> 02:23.430
Oh, man.
Sarge is pissed.

02:23.431 --> 02:25.099
What are we gonna do, Jake?

02:25.100 --> 02:26.734
Don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.

02:26.735 --> 02:29.036
We just have
to turn this debacle

02:29.037 --> 02:31.271
into a straight-up "bacle."

02:31.306 --> 02:33.340
Guess I should be getting back.

02:33.341 --> 02:35.209
Uncle Ray, thank you
for loaning me

02:35.210 --> 02:36.510
you best detective for lunch.

02:36.511 --> 02:37.645
My pleasure.

02:37.646 --> 02:39.547
Of course, she is entitled
to 45 minutes

02:39.548 --> 02:42.116
as per her union contract.

02:42.117 --> 02:44.752
Okay, well, great to see you.

02:44.753 --> 02:47.520
Bye, baby.

02:47.556 --> 02:49.355
A minute, Detective Diaz.

02:51.326 --> 02:52.726
What's going on
with you and Marcus?

02:52.727 --> 02:54.094
What are you talking about?

02:54.095 --> 02:56.397
Your shoulders tightened
when he said "baby."

02:56.398 --> 02:57.832
Your nostrils flared
when I asked

02:57.833 --> 02:59.098
what was going on
with the two of you.

02:59.134 --> 03:00.533
And you have saag paneer
on your sleeve,

03:00.569 --> 03:03.304
which, given your aversion
to Indian cuisine,

03:03.305 --> 03:05.439
suggests you let him
choose the restaurant.

03:05.440 --> 03:06.472
Why would you do that?

03:06.508 --> 03:08.676
- Kindness.
- Pity.

03:08.677 --> 03:09.809
You're about
to break up with him.

03:09.845 --> 03:12.847
- Damn, you are good.
- Mm-hmm.

03:12.848 --> 03:14.748
Things aren't working out.

03:14.749 --> 03:15.949
I don't want to talk about it.

03:15.984 --> 03:17.550
I regret the words
we've already spoken.

03:17.586 --> 03:20.454
Listen, I know I probably
shouldn't get involved,

03:20.455 --> 03:22.356
but Marcus is my nephew,

03:22.357 --> 03:25.325
and I hope you'll
let him down gently.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.527
Don't worry.

03:26.528 --> 03:28.262
I don't want things
to be awkward.

03:28.263 --> 03:29.763
I'm gonna send him a text
while he's sleeping

03:29.764 --> 03:30.830
that says, "We're done."

03:30.866 --> 03:32.833
Clear. Accurate.

03:32.834 --> 03:35.168
But do you feel
like it's enough?

03:35.203 --> 03:37.071
"We're done.

03:37.072 --> 03:38.071
Good-bye."

03:38.106 --> 03:40.640
Yes.
That should do it.

03:40.675 --> 03:42.008
What's going on, Peralta?

03:42.043 --> 03:43.310
Charles says
you're going to make me

03:43.311 --> 03:44.911
happier than I was
on my wedding night.

03:44.946 --> 03:46.447
Well, that's not how
I would have put it,

03:46.448 --> 03:48.515
but I know you were mad at me
for ruining blooper time,

03:48.516 --> 03:50.516
so I did all your paperwork.

03:50.552 --> 03:51.619
That's not helpful.

03:51.620 --> 03:53.186
You always make
a thousand mistakes.

03:53.221 --> 03:54.822
Mm-hmm, that's what
Amy said as well

03:54.823 --> 03:56.190
right before
she took over for me,

03:56.191 --> 03:57.358
so it's perfect.

03:57.359 --> 03:59.293
Okay.
Hey, thanks, man.

03:59.294 --> 04:00.294
I appreciate it.

04:00.295 --> 04:02.662
And I spoke with Sharon.

04:02.697 --> 04:03.831
I spoke with Captain Holt.

04:03.832 --> 04:05.365
And we all agree
that you deserve a break.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.068
So this weekend, Charles and I

04:08.069 --> 04:09.837
are taking you
to the great outdoors

04:09.838 --> 04:12.272
to Detective Lohank's cabin.

04:12.307 --> 04:14.040
Boom.
Suck it, wedding night.

04:14.075 --> 04:16.577
Lohank?
That sad sack?

04:16.577 --> 04:17.911
All he does is talk
about his wife

04:17.913 --> 04:18.945
sleeping with other men.

04:18.980 --> 04:20.714
No, he also has
some great stories

04:20.714 --> 04:22.116
about his prostate cancer.

04:22.117 --> 04:23.584
Besides, he's not
sticking around.

04:23.585 --> 04:24.717
It's just the three of us.

04:24.753 --> 04:26.220
Those woods are full of ticks.

04:26.221 --> 04:27.454
It's Lyme disease central.

04:27.455 --> 04:28.789
So we'll get some bug spray.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.790
Plus that cabin's
probably covered in black mold.

04:30.825 --> 04:33.260
- Racist.
- You know what?

04:33.261 --> 04:36.195
I am gonna stay home
and have a blooper bath.

04:36.231 --> 04:38.032
Oh, come on, Sarge.

04:38.033 --> 04:39.099
It's gonna be fun.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.334
You remember fun, right?

04:40.335 --> 04:41.435
What's that supposed to mean?

04:41.436 --> 04:42.669
Nothing.
It's just...

04:42.704 --> 04:44.405
I planned this awesome
guys' weekend for us,

04:44.406 --> 04:46.205
and all you can think about
is Lyme disease.

04:46.241 --> 04:47.441
Untrue.

04:47.442 --> 04:49.042
I'm thinking about
all tick-borne diseases...

04:49.077 --> 04:54.480
anaplasmosis, tularemia,
Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

04:54.516 --> 04:56.916
You know, maybe I could
just chill out a little.

04:56.952 --> 04:58.852
Yes.
You're stressed.

04:58.853 --> 05:00.920
A little fun would
do you good, I promise.

05:00.956 --> 05:04.425
You know what?
You're right.

05:04.426 --> 05:06.359
You all better get ready
for fun Terry.

05:06.394 --> 05:07.860
Ooh, fun Terry.
He sounds fun.

05:07.896 --> 05:09.830
Oh, he's crazy.

05:09.831 --> 05:11.164
Thanks for planning this, Jake.

05:11.199 --> 05:13.801
No, thank you for being amazing

05:13.802 --> 05:15.336
and also for driving us
up to the cabin.

05:15.337 --> 05:17.237
My car's in the shop,
and riding in Charles's

05:17.238 --> 05:18.939
is like sitting inside
of a dog's behonkus.

05:18.940 --> 05:20.240
Fun Terry.
Can't wait.

05:20.241 --> 05:22.575
Hey, Gina.
Would you do me a favor?

05:22.610 --> 05:24.611
Yes, thank you for asking.

05:24.612 --> 05:27.548
I did not feel like
doing this work right now.

05:27.549 --> 05:29.483
Oh, those look like
important papers.

05:29.484 --> 05:31.417
What's up?
How can I help?

05:31.453 --> 05:34.188
Well, when I was a kid,

05:34.189 --> 05:36.323
I invented a magnetic
flashlight clip

05:36.324 --> 05:40.060
so I could read
under the covers.

05:40.061 --> 05:43.297
This clip and I went
all around the world together...

05:43.298 --> 05:47.533
the Shire, Sweet Valley High,
Terabithia.

05:47.569 --> 05:49.535
But never
to a friend's house, huh?

05:49.571 --> 05:51.305
Uncalled for.

05:51.306 --> 05:53.674
Anyway, I realized that this
could be really helpful

05:53.675 --> 05:55.676
for police work,
so I made an appointment

05:55.677 --> 05:57.378
with the head
of NYPD purchasing.

05:57.379 --> 05:59.313
I have to sell him on it,
but I'm afraid

05:59.314 --> 06:02.415
I might come across
a little boring.

06:02.450 --> 06:05.052
Amy, are you asking me

06:05.053 --> 06:06.252
to "She's All That" you?

06:06.287 --> 06:07.855
I didn't read that.

06:07.856 --> 06:10.557
But if it's about
helping out a friend, then yes.

06:10.558 --> 06:13.494
Please "She's All That" me.

06:13.495 --> 06:14.495
Okay.

06:14.496 --> 06:16.797
But if we're gonna do this,

06:16.798 --> 06:19.033
we're gonna do it my way,
all right?

06:19.034 --> 06:21.802
First I'm going to need
to break you down to nothing

06:21.803 --> 06:23.937
and then build you back up
piece by piece.

06:23.938 --> 06:25.239
Well, the meeting's tomorrow.

06:25.240 --> 06:26.874
Well, we'll just
break you down to nothing

06:26.875 --> 06:28.275
and see what time it is.

06:28.276 --> 06:31.644
Mmm!
What is that smell?

06:31.679 --> 06:34.415
That is the absence of urine.

06:34.416 --> 06:35.915
You got to leave Brooklyn
to get that.

06:35.950 --> 06:37.918
No urine...
I could get used to this.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.153
Oh, yes.

06:39.154 --> 06:40.653
And that's just the beginning,
my friend.

06:40.688 --> 06:42.489
Just wait till you're
sitting fireside,

06:42.490 --> 06:44.425
sipping on a premium
Chinese Scotch,

06:44.426 --> 06:46.592
and smoking a sweet
Rwandan cigar.

06:46.628 --> 06:48.028
Okay.
Okay.

06:48.029 --> 06:50.664
I probably could have done
without the countries of origin,

06:50.665 --> 06:51.932
but that sounds great.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.266
- Yeah.
- What else do you have planned?

06:53.301 --> 06:55.736
Oh, so much.
I'm talking fishing.

06:55.737 --> 06:57.571
I'm talking poker.
I'm talking Frisbee.

06:57.572 --> 06:58.871
Boyle, what else am I talking?

06:58.907 --> 07:01.374
Wildflower picking so we can
make our own cologne.

07:01.409 --> 07:03.243
Nope, I was talking
bonfires and s'mores,

07:03.244 --> 07:04.844
but that's my fault
for throwing to you.

07:04.879 --> 07:06.312
This is going to be fun as hell.

07:06.347 --> 07:08.714
This is going to be
the best weekend ever!

07:08.750 --> 07:11.350
Welcome to Stink Puddle Manor.

07:11.386 --> 07:12.820
Stink Puddle?

07:12.821 --> 07:14.554
Manor.

07:15.798 --> 07:17.347
Just out of curiosity,
why would you

07:17.348 --> 07:18.714
name your house Stink Puddle?

07:18.749 --> 07:19.749
Oh, I didn't.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.017
The home inspector
came up with it.

07:21.018 --> 07:23.352
I can't smell anything
since the radiation therapy.

07:23.387 --> 07:25.521
Another great story, eh?

07:25.522 --> 07:28.590
So there's no power, no heat.

07:28.626 --> 07:29.626
Is there running water?

07:29.627 --> 07:31.327
Of course there's running water.

07:31.328 --> 07:32.394
Oh, but I wouldn't use it.

07:32.429 --> 07:33.830
It's very contaminated.

07:33.831 --> 07:34.998
We had three dogs
die in the well.

07:34.999 --> 07:36.132
Three?

07:36.133 --> 07:37.500
If they weren't
all tied together,

07:37.501 --> 07:39.068
we might have just lost the one.

07:39.069 --> 07:41.104
Sad thing is, they were
therapy dogs for my son.

07:41.105 --> 07:42.371
Oh.

07:42.406 --> 07:44.373
He had real abandonment issues
after my wife left.

07:44.408 --> 07:46.042
It was kind of like
an emotional scar

07:46.043 --> 07:47.310
on an emotional scar.

07:47.311 --> 07:49.077
But the woods are
super nice, right?

07:49.113 --> 07:50.546
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Gorgeous.

07:50.547 --> 07:52.114
Except during sinkhole season.

07:52.149 --> 07:53.343
When's sinkhole season?

07:53.350 --> 07:54.916
It's been going on for,
like, 20 years now.

07:54.952 --> 07:56.753
It's kind of like
a "Game of Thrones" winter.

07:56.754 --> 07:57.753
Right. Yeah.

07:57.788 --> 07:59.222
Anyway, I'll leave
you guys to it.

07:59.223 --> 08:00.390
Have fun.

08:00.391 --> 08:02.425
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

08:02.426 --> 08:03.425
For instance,

08:03.460 --> 08:05.528
drink the water or let your wife

08:05.529 --> 08:06.595
go on work trips.

08:06.630 --> 08:08.096
Duly noted.

08:08.132 --> 08:09.564
<i>You wanted to see me?</i>

08:09.600 --> 08:11.200
I told Kevin about
how I approved

08:11.201 --> 08:12.802
of your strategy
for breaking up with Marcus,

08:12.803 --> 08:15.871
and he said that we were
"sociopaths."

08:15.906 --> 08:16.906
So you're gonna leave him?

08:16.907 --> 08:18.941
No, I think he may have a point.

08:18.942 --> 08:22.277
You might need to do more
than simply text.

08:22.313 --> 08:24.080
A long, drawn-out breakup
is just gonna end

08:24.081 --> 08:26.349
in a big scene
and Marcus crying.

08:26.350 --> 08:29.719
He has so many emotions.

08:31.855 --> 08:36.159
It's just so beautiful
how much they love each other.

08:36.159 --> 08:38.126
It's a commercial

08:38.128 --> 08:39.529
for a refrigerator.

08:39.530 --> 08:41.130
Yes, it is daunting.

08:41.131 --> 08:43.999
But I did some research
on amicable breakups.

08:44.034 --> 08:48.371
I visited
www.ladiesgoodhealthmag.com/

08:48.372 --> 08:58.346
6-relationships/867599904/
9432&20.html.

08:59.183 --> 09:01.017
- Do you know that site?
- No.

09:01.018 --> 09:03.386
Well, apparently,
it's less painful

09:03.387 --> 09:07.957
if you acknowledge
the dumpee's feelings.

09:07.958 --> 09:09.325
- Ew.
- But don't worry.

09:09.326 --> 09:10.993
We'll practice.
Hmm?

09:10.994 --> 09:13.362
I'll be Marcus.
Go.

09:14.698 --> 09:17.532
Marcus, I think
we should break up.

09:17.568 --> 09:19.302
That makes me feel sad.

09:19.303 --> 09:20.302
I am sad.

09:20.337 --> 09:21.470
Your sadness is noted.

09:21.505 --> 09:23.306
I feel acknowledged.

09:23.307 --> 09:24.907
Thank you for breaking up
with me.

09:24.908 --> 09:28.043
It will take me eight minutes
to collect my things.

09:28.078 --> 09:29.277
I think that went very well.

09:29.313 --> 09:30.346
Hmm.

09:30.347 --> 09:31.813
Okay, creek.

09:31.849 --> 09:35.485
I'd like three fresh trout
to go, please.

09:37.855 --> 09:39.188
It just went straight up.

09:39.189 --> 09:41.157
Now it's coming down.
Oh, boy!

09:41.158 --> 09:43.493
Watch and learn, losers.

09:43.494 --> 09:45.661
Yah!

09:45.662 --> 09:47.463
- I didn't see where it went.
- Back of my neck.

09:47.464 --> 09:49.831
It's in the back of my neck.

09:49.867 --> 09:53.001
Okay, I've learned
from your mistakes.

09:53.036 --> 09:58.274
Not too hard,
late release, and...

09:59.910 --> 10:01.677
That was fun.
Fishing was fun.

10:01.678 --> 10:02.779
- Yeah.
- Back to the cabin?

10:02.780 --> 10:03.845
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:03.881 --> 10:05.747
Before we get into your pitch,

10:05.783 --> 10:07.349
what are you
calling the product?

10:07.384 --> 10:11.420
The Handless Lighting System,
or HLS.

10:11.455 --> 10:13.456
Sounds like a genetic disorder.

10:13.457 --> 10:16.091
How's about Shoulder Nova?

10:16.126 --> 10:17.693
I love it.
Amazing.

10:17.694 --> 10:18.860
It's perfect.

10:18.896 --> 10:20.430
Now let's talk presentation.

10:20.431 --> 10:22.131
What's your opener?

10:22.132 --> 10:24.267
Hi, I'm Amy Santiago,

10:24.268 --> 10:26.936
and my product will make
a real difference.

10:26.937 --> 10:29.271
It is the Shoulder Nova.

10:29.306 --> 10:33.208
My only note is, make it
1000% more captivating.

10:33.243 --> 10:35.011
Very good note.
Yeah.

10:35.012 --> 10:36.312
Okay.

10:36.313 --> 10:38.714
I got it.

10:38.715 --> 10:41.117
Mm...

10:41.118 --> 10:43.186
Ding.

10:43.187 --> 10:47.990
Oh, hello.
I'm Amy Santiago.

10:47.991 --> 10:50.126
Was that captivating enough?

10:50.127 --> 10:53.395
Weirdly, it might have been
a scooch too captivating.

10:53.430 --> 10:54.997
Here's what I'm thinking.

10:54.998 --> 10:57.500
Mm-kay?
You can take a seat.

10:57.501 --> 10:59.502
Okay.

10:59.503 --> 11:04.106
Until this moment,
there was only darkness.

11:04.107 --> 11:07.743
But now there is...

11:07.744 --> 11:08.777
light.

11:09.847 --> 11:11.647
I am Vanessa Santiago,

11:11.648 --> 11:15.485
and I'm about
to blow your minds.

11:15.486 --> 11:17.086
You want me to change
my name to Vanessa?

11:17.120 --> 11:18.821
Desperately.

11:18.822 --> 11:21.190
I got to say, the Chinese

11:21.191 --> 11:23.158
know how to make
a terrible scotch.

11:23.193 --> 11:24.393
They certainly do.

11:24.394 --> 11:26.162
Ugh, it's bad.
Gets you drunk, though.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.929
Well, I found all the worms.

11:27.965 --> 11:29.932
They're eating a fox corpse
in the outhouse.

11:29.933 --> 11:32.301
Speaking of which,
I'm getting hungry.

11:32.302 --> 11:34.070
- What's for dinner?
- Dinner?

11:34.071 --> 11:36.972
Yes, of course. Dinner.

11:37.007 --> 11:38.340
Did you not pack any food?

11:38.375 --> 11:39.509
There's fresh fox.

11:39.510 --> 11:41.010
Oh, it is not fresh.

11:41.011 --> 11:42.144
Are you serious?

11:42.145 --> 11:43.713
We stopped three times
on the way up here

11:43.714 --> 11:46.949
to buy fireworks, and you
never thought to get groceries?

11:46.950 --> 11:48.150
What was in those coolers?

11:48.151 --> 11:49.519
The fireworks.

11:49.520 --> 11:52.021
Look, I thought we would be
incredible at fishing.

11:52.022 --> 11:53.488
Excuse me for believing in us.

11:53.524 --> 11:56.959
It'll be okay, guys.
No need to worry.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.662
I just took a foraging class,
and not to brag,

11:59.663 --> 12:01.429
I was voted Mr. Fungus.

12:01.465 --> 12:03.666
Aha, Mr. Fungus to the rescue.

12:03.667 --> 12:05.201
See, Sarge, everything's
going to work out,

12:05.202 --> 12:06.501
and you don't have to stress
all the time.

12:06.537 --> 12:08.169
Boyle, you really think
you can find us dinner?

12:08.205 --> 12:11.040
Um, let's just say

12:11.041 --> 12:13.375
it's gonna be a "spore-gasbord."

12:15.012 --> 12:16.645
Something bad happened
to Charles, didn't it?

12:16.680 --> 12:17.780
Big time.

12:17.781 --> 12:19.348
Oh God, what if the last thing

12:19.349 --> 12:21.657
we ever heard him say
was "spore-gasbord?"

12:22.671 --> 12:25.884
Charles!
Charles!

12:25.885 --> 12:27.205
I'm starting
to get worried, Jake.

12:27.219 --> 12:28.486
Relax.

12:28.487 --> 12:30.388
If anybody can handle it
out here, it's Charles.

12:30.389 --> 12:32.524
He saw "Into the Woods"
ten times in the theater.

12:32.525 --> 12:34.058
Watch it.
That's poison ivy.

12:34.059 --> 12:35.960
Whoa. Good call.

12:35.961 --> 12:37.627
I'm allergic to poison ivy.

12:37.630 --> 12:39.163
I got it one time
at sports camp,

12:39.164 --> 12:42.000
making out in the woods
with Liz Almont.

12:42.001 --> 12:43.835
Okay, fine.
We weren't making out.

12:43.836 --> 12:45.169
I was looking for my inhaler.

12:45.170 --> 12:48.673
And it wasn't sports camp.
It was asthma camp.

12:48.674 --> 12:51.309
Hey, Jake.
Are we lost?

12:51.310 --> 12:52.477
What? No.

12:52.478 --> 12:54.279
We're on an "adventure."

12:54.280 --> 12:55.446
Right, Fun Terry?

12:55.447 --> 12:56.648
Fun Terry's gone.

12:56.649 --> 12:58.349
He starved to death an hour ago.

12:58.350 --> 12:59.784
This is Original Terry.

12:59.785 --> 13:00.952
That's the worst Terry.

13:00.953 --> 13:03.721
You didn't bring a map
or a flashlight

13:03.722 --> 13:05.757
or anything that could keep us
from getting lost?

13:05.758 --> 13:07.792
Yes, I brought
all of those things.

13:07.793 --> 13:09.193
It's called a cell phone.

13:09.194 --> 13:11.229
Map. Flashlight.
Compass.

13:11.230 --> 13:12.864
An app that makes me
sound like T-Pain.

13:12.865 --> 13:14.532
Nope, the battery's dead.
Now it's just a brick.

13:14.533 --> 13:16.167
But don't freak out.

13:16.168 --> 13:18.236
I don't need an app
to sound like T-Pain, right?

13:18.237 --> 13:22.173
♪ We're totally lost ♪

13:22.174 --> 13:24.975
Yeah, that was a little
more Kermit, but...

13:27.413 --> 13:28.546
Oh, you're back.

13:28.547 --> 13:29.614
How did the breakup go?

13:29.615 --> 13:31.382
I tried to acknowledge
his feelings.

13:31.383 --> 13:32.984
It wasn't easy.
There were a lot of them.

13:32.985 --> 13:35.954
I'm just so confused.

13:35.955 --> 13:38.623
So sad.

13:38.624 --> 13:39.958
Are you climbing out the window?

13:39.959 --> 13:41.092
No.

13:41.093 --> 13:42.727
I climbed back in,
and we talked about emotions

13:42.728 --> 13:43.928
for 20 minutes.

13:43.929 --> 13:45.163
- Dear God.
- I know.

13:45.164 --> 13:46.230
But I think it went well.

13:46.231 --> 13:47.332
At least there was no crying.

13:47.333 --> 13:48.866
Well done, Diaz.

13:48.867 --> 13:50.635
I'm actually really glad
you made me do it this way.

13:50.636 --> 13:53.972
I got to tell him
that even though it was ending,

13:53.973 --> 13:56.174
it was incredibly
meaningful to me,

13:56.175 --> 13:57.842
and I'm gonna miss him.

13:57.843 --> 13:59.243
Oh, no.

13:59.244 --> 14:02.947
This is exactly
what I didn't want.

14:02.948 --> 14:05.450
You crying?
Oof!

14:05.451 --> 14:06.651
I deserved that.

14:06.652 --> 14:08.753
Charles is dead, and we're next.

14:08.754 --> 14:10.855
All right, don't be
so melodramatic.

14:10.856 --> 14:12.557
He's probably chewing
on bark and berries,

14:12.558 --> 14:14.425
having the time of his life,
safe and sound.

14:14.426 --> 14:15.927
Terry! Jake!

14:15.928 --> 14:18.029
Ho, ho!
What's that I hear?

14:18.030 --> 14:20.031
Charles Boyle, safe and sound?

14:20.032 --> 14:21.366
What are you saying, Charles?

14:21.367 --> 14:23.034
That you're having
the time of your life?

14:23.035 --> 14:25.703
I fell in a sinkhole,
and I'm badly hurt!

14:25.704 --> 14:28.373
Damn it!

14:28.374 --> 14:29.607
Boyle, what the hell?

14:29.608 --> 14:31.142
I know.
It's a pretty big hole, right?

14:31.143 --> 14:32.377
How'd you end up down there?

14:32.378 --> 14:34.212
I spotted
a gorgeous chanterelle.

14:34.213 --> 14:36.814
I reached for it, but then
I rolled my ankle and fell in.

14:36.815 --> 14:38.650
All right, buddy, don't worry.
We got you, okay?

14:38.651 --> 14:40.151
I was so scared, you guys.

14:40.152 --> 14:41.819
A psychic told me I was
gonna die alone in a pit,

14:41.820 --> 14:43.187
and I kept telling myself,

14:43.188 --> 14:45.289
"This is a hole, not a pit.
This is a hole, not a pit.

14:45.290 --> 14:46.524
"This is a hole, not a pit.

14:46.525 --> 14:47.659
"This is a hole, not a pit.

14:47.660 --> 14:48.793
Charles, it's a hole,
not a pit."

14:48.794 --> 14:51.562
All right.
Here, grab me.

14:52.998 --> 14:54.065
Take my hand, all right?

14:54.066 --> 14:55.800
Okay.

14:55.801 --> 14:57.702
Okay, now pull us up, Terry.

14:57.703 --> 14:59.170
Oh crap, I'm slipping!

15:02.708 --> 15:05.810
No, it's Lohank's dogs
all over again!

15:05.811 --> 15:08.079
So in conclusion,

15:08.080 --> 15:09.880
by eliminating
flashlight fumbling,

15:09.915 --> 15:12.550
the Shoulder Nova could save
the average police officer

15:12.551 --> 15:14.519
over 13,000 seconds.

15:14.520 --> 15:17.889
Wow, that sounds like
a lot, Vanessa.

15:17.890 --> 15:19.157
It is.

15:19.158 --> 15:22.260
I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

15:22.261 --> 15:24.729
You have the right
to remain...

15:24.730 --> 15:26.164
Uhh!

15:26.165 --> 15:27.699
Well lit!

15:29.168 --> 15:31.235
Wow, that presentation
was terrific.

15:31.236 --> 15:32.570
So fun to watch.

15:32.571 --> 15:33.571
Thank you, sir.

15:33.572 --> 15:35.006
See, the problem is the product.

15:35.007 --> 15:36.708
I just don't see
any need for it at all.

15:36.709 --> 15:38.176
I just put the flashlight
in my mouth

15:38.177 --> 15:39.243
when my hands are full.

15:39.244 --> 15:41.279
Sir, the human mouth is nasty.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.680
Yeah, but mouths are free.

15:42.681 --> 15:44.916
I'm sorry.
I'm just not interested.

15:44.917 --> 15:48.452
Okay.
Thank you for your time.

15:51.423 --> 15:54.859
You are scum.

15:56.462 --> 15:57.628
This isn't working.

15:57.629 --> 15:59.797
- Great trip, Jake.
- Oh, thanks, man.

15:59.798 --> 16:00.832
You know that was sarcastic!

16:00.833 --> 16:01.966
How?

16:01.967 --> 16:03.234
You didn't bring food or water

16:03.235 --> 16:05.002
or ask if Lohank's cabin

16:05.003 --> 16:06.504
was straight out
of a horror movie.

16:06.505 --> 16:07.939
Now you got us trapped in a pit!

16:07.940 --> 16:09.040
Hole.

16:09.041 --> 16:10.307
Okay, I know that things

16:10.342 --> 16:11.743
are not looking great right now,

16:11.744 --> 16:13.411
but you have to admit,
you were having fun earlier.

16:13.412 --> 16:16.080
I'm not now.
I'm more stressed than ever.

16:16.081 --> 16:17.381
Maybe that's 'cause
you're just focusing

16:17.382 --> 16:18.950
on the negative, Ter-bear.
I mean, look at Charles.

16:18.951 --> 16:20.451
He's chill.
I'm chill.

16:20.452 --> 16:22.820
That's 'cause he's in shock!
You know what?

16:22.821 --> 16:24.255
The reason you're so chill

16:24.256 --> 16:27.090
is because you have everyone
cleaning up your messes for you.

16:27.126 --> 16:29.627
Didn't bring food?
Charles will find mushrooms.

16:29.628 --> 16:31.928
Smashed through a window?
Terry'll do the paperwork.

16:31.964 --> 16:33.463
Hey, I did the paperwork.

16:33.499 --> 16:35.032
No, Amy did it!

16:35.033 --> 16:36.501
Oh, guys, please,
please calm down.

16:36.502 --> 16:37.935
I hate it when you argue.

16:37.936 --> 16:39.804
It reminds of when my dad
used to fight

16:39.805 --> 16:42.038
with my best friend...
my mom.

16:42.074 --> 16:43.574
I'm done with this.

16:43.575 --> 16:45.076
I'm going to sleep.

16:45.077 --> 16:46.210
Charles, spoon with me.

16:46.211 --> 16:47.678
We need to huddle
together for warmth.

16:47.679 --> 16:49.280
No, Charles,
you're my best friend.

16:49.281 --> 16:50.481
You're going to spoon with me.

16:50.482 --> 16:51.649
I called first spoon.

16:51.650 --> 16:52.984
Charles, get over here
right now.

16:52.985 --> 16:55.119
Boyle, don't throw away
a lifelong friendship

16:55.120 --> 16:56.621
for a one-night spoon
with Terry.

16:56.622 --> 16:58.122
Okay, enough.
We're gonna stop fighting.

16:58.123 --> 16:59.357
We're gonna lie down,

16:59.358 --> 17:01.325
and we're gonna triple-spoon
like grown-ups!

17:01.326 --> 17:04.095
Come on, bring it in.
Bring it in.

17:06.865 --> 17:08.132
There, okay.

17:08.133 --> 17:10.467
See, that's better, right?

17:10.502 --> 17:12.470
So do we know any songs?

17:12.471 --> 17:13.670
Shut up, Charles!

17:18.625 --> 17:20.259
Jake?
Where's Jake?

17:20.260 --> 17:21.926
Did you eat him, Terry?

17:21.928 --> 17:23.060
No!

17:23.061 --> 17:25.998
Good morning, guys!

17:25.999 --> 17:27.299
How'd you get out of the pit?

17:27.300 --> 17:28.967
Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy.

17:28.968 --> 17:30.536
Actually, it took me hours.

17:30.537 --> 17:33.038
I tied all my clothes together,
tethered them to a log,

17:33.039 --> 17:34.606
and used it as a grappling hook.

17:34.607 --> 17:36.275
Managed to snag it in a root.

17:36.276 --> 17:37.341
Aren't you freezing?

17:37.377 --> 17:38.377
Not at all.

17:38.378 --> 17:40.345
Mainly because
my skin is on fire

17:40.346 --> 17:42.014
from all the poison ivy
in this tree.

17:43.116 --> 17:44.216
Why'd you do that?

17:44.217 --> 17:46.218
Oh, let me guess.
Dumb mistake.

17:46.219 --> 17:48.854
No, dumb choice.

17:48.855 --> 17:50.522
I didn't want to sit around
and wait for somebody

17:50.523 --> 17:51.622
to clean up my mess.

17:51.658 --> 17:53.458
Hmm, I guess
I got through to you.

17:53.459 --> 17:54.826
Yeah.

17:54.827 --> 17:57.963
Also, after you fell asleep,
Boyle really laid into me.

17:57.964 --> 17:58.964
It was brutal.

17:58.965 --> 18:00.666
I got to say, Jake, this time,

18:00.667 --> 18:02.935
I think you're only 99% right.

18:04.637 --> 18:06.271
- We're rolling.
- No!

18:06.272 --> 18:08.273
Argh!

18:09.609 --> 18:11.376
Well, can you see anything
from up there?

18:11.377 --> 18:12.611
Yes, I can...

18:12.612 --> 18:15.914
Stink Puddle Manor,
about 65 trees sunward.

18:15.915 --> 18:17.215
Man, one day in the woods,

18:17.216 --> 18:19.318
and I'm freakin'
Lewis and Clark up here.

18:19.319 --> 18:21.053
<i>Thank you for coming, Diaz.</i>

18:21.054 --> 18:22.854
I want to apologize
for yesterday.

18:22.855 --> 18:25.557
Inserting myself into
my employee's breakup

18:25.558 --> 18:28.927
with my nephew somehow,
uh, backfired.

18:28.928 --> 18:30.395
It's not your fault.

18:30.396 --> 18:33.966
I'm the one that made a scene
like a dumb, crying baby.

18:33.967 --> 18:36.168
I'm considering having
my tear ducts melted shut.

18:36.169 --> 18:40.105
It's not the end
of the world to feel...

18:40.106 --> 18:41.173
things.

18:41.174 --> 18:42.274
I guess not.

18:42.275 --> 18:43.609
It's up there.

18:43.610 --> 18:45.978
The thing is,
I really care about Marcus,

18:45.979 --> 18:47.546
but he wanted to get married,

18:47.547 --> 18:50.282
and I'm just not ready for that.

18:50.283 --> 18:52.784
And if I'm not ready
with a guy as great as Marcus,

18:52.785 --> 18:56.355
then what if I'm never ready?

18:56.356 --> 18:57.689
What if that was it,

18:57.690 --> 19:00.459
my one chance at love?

19:00.460 --> 19:03.362
What if I never get
a second chance?

19:03.363 --> 19:07.933
I don't know.
I'm just...

19:07.934 --> 19:09.601
I'm just sad.

19:09.602 --> 19:13.839
Well, I understand.

19:13.840 --> 19:16.240
It must be very difficult.

19:18.277 --> 19:19.811
Wait, are you crying?

19:19.812 --> 19:22.648
Yes.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.417
Thank you for acknowledging
my feelings.

19:25.418 --> 19:27.686
Thank you for
acknowledging mine.

19:30.223 --> 19:33.458
We're both great at this.

19:33.459 --> 19:36.294
Hey, sport.

19:36.295 --> 19:38.230
You look a little D in the D.

19:38.231 --> 19:41.066
D for "down in dumps,"
respectively.

19:41.067 --> 19:42.734
Probably easier
to just not abbreviate

19:42.735 --> 19:43.802
if you have to explain it.

19:43.803 --> 19:45.237
Agree to D.

19:45.238 --> 19:46.972
I wanted to talk to you
about yesterday.

19:46.973 --> 19:51.009
Yeah, thank you for all
your help with the presentation.

19:51.010 --> 19:52.878
And I'm sorry you had
to waste your talent

19:52.879 --> 19:54.546
on such a stupid product.

19:54.547 --> 19:56.214
Without product makers like you,

19:56.215 --> 19:58.016
us dazzle-doves
wouldn't have nothing

19:58.017 --> 19:59.384
to shake our wings over.

19:59.385 --> 20:01.586
Yeah, but my invention
was useless.

20:01.587 --> 20:03.822
No, that scum was wrong.

20:03.823 --> 20:06.458
I showed the Shoulder Nova
to a girl in my building.

20:06.459 --> 20:09.327
She's like a mini Amy,
and she loved it.

20:09.328 --> 20:11.430
She said she was gonna break
the world record

20:11.431 --> 20:12.464
for speed-reading.

20:12.465 --> 20:13.832
Psh! Yeah.

20:13.833 --> 20:16.735
Like some little girl's gonna
take down Yuri Jurgonav.

20:18.905 --> 20:21.840
Anyway, I know
it wasn't what you wanted,

20:21.841 --> 20:24.376
but you still made a difference.

20:24.377 --> 20:26.411
Thanks, Gina.

20:26.412 --> 20:28.780
I guess I did make a D.

20:28.781 --> 20:30.682
- Don't steal my thing.
- Okay.

20:30.683 --> 20:32.984
- That's all I ask.
- I won't.

20:32.985 --> 20:34.386
Hey, Sarge.

20:34.387 --> 20:37.189
Why'd you want us
to meet you out here?

20:37.190 --> 20:38.623
To thank you guys
for the weekend.

20:38.624 --> 20:41.126
Really?
It was a total disaster.

20:41.127 --> 20:42.327
Not a total disaster.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.162
None of us got sick
from that dog water.

20:44.163 --> 20:46.531
- You drank that?
- No.

20:46.532 --> 20:48.767
Look, Jake, you were right.

20:48.768 --> 20:51.336
I have kind of forgotten
how to have fun.

20:51.337 --> 20:54.106
I'm going to try
to work on that, so...

20:55.508 --> 20:57.142
The fireworks
you made me surrender

20:57.143 --> 20:58.877
when we reentered New York!

20:58.878 --> 21:02.047
Uh-huh.
Fun Terry's back.

21:02.048 --> 21:04.416
We're gonna set 'em off
in a big pile, all at once.

21:04.417 --> 21:06.151
By shooting our guns at them?

21:06.152 --> 21:07.886
- What? No.
- No.

21:07.887 --> 21:09.454
We're going to set 'em off
like normal people.

21:09.455 --> 21:11.523
Oh.
That's good too.

21:11.524 --> 21:14.459
Ooh.

21:16.162 --> 21:17.362
Here we go.

21:17.363 --> 21:18.864
Whoo-hoo!

21:20.199 --> 21:21.666
See how fun this is?

21:21.667 --> 21:23.468
Original Terry
would have been worried

21:23.469 --> 21:26.471
that we're standing too close
and need safety goggles,

21:26.472 --> 21:27.773
and he would have been
absolutely right.

21:27.774 --> 21:29.007
We're way too close.
Run!
