THIS IS GOING
TO BE TOUGH.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.901
TOUGH? CHIEF,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

08:55.903 --> 08:57.903
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.971
WE DON'T HAVE THE MEN
OR THE RESOURCES

08:59.973 --> 09:02.874
INSIDE TO HANDLE
A DROP OF THIS MAGNITUDE.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.309
LOMMERS: YOU IMPRESS
ME AS SOMEONE WHO

09:04.311 --> 09:07.145
ISN'T DETERRED
BY A CHALLENGE.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.581
WHY DOES IT HAVE
TO BE TOMORROW?

09:10.017 --> 09:12.751
SURELY THERE IS ENOUGH
FOOD WITHIN THE CORDON

09:12.753 --> 09:14.719
TO ALLOW US THE TIME
TO PLAN THIS RIGHT.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.389
ACTUALLY, BY THE END
OF THE FIRST WEEK,

09:17.391 --> 09:19.257
MOST OF
THE PERISHABLES
ARE GONE.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.492
WHAT FEW GROCERY
STORES THERE ARE

09:20.494 --> 09:23.395
INSIDE THE CORDON
BY NOW HAVE LIKELY
BEEN PICKED OVER

09:23.397 --> 09:24.563
AND THAT'S NOT
TO MENTION THOSE

09:24.565 --> 09:25.931
WHO DIDN'T HAVE
MUCH TO BEGIN WITH.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.666
IN SITUATIONS
LIKE THIS,
PEOPLE GET NERVOUS

09:27.668 --> 09:30.235
AND THEY
START RATIONING
THEIR FOOD.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.770
RATIONING BY ITS
VERY NATURE

09:31.772 --> 09:33.738
MAKES PEOPLE
EVEN HUNGRIER.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.074
HUNGER
CREATES CHAOS.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.542
YOU WANNA TALK
ABOUT CHAOS?

09:37.544 --> 09:39.945
DROP THAT MUCH FOOD
INTO A QUARANTINE ZONE

09:39.947 --> 09:41.746
WITHOUT PREPARATION.

09:41.748 --> 09:42.781
YOU ARE
MAKING ASSUMPTIONS

09:42.783 --> 09:44.716
ABOUT THE BREADTH
OF MY EXPERIENCE

09:44.718 --> 09:45.951
IN THESE
SITUATIONS, MAJOR.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.753
ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH WHAT WENT ON
IN SIERRA LEONE?

09:48.755 --> 09:50.722
I KNOW A LOT
OF PEOPLE DIED.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.157
THEY DID.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.759
AND I WAS PART
OF THE EFFORT

09:54.761 --> 09:57.662
TO KEEP PEOPLE
FROM DYING.

09:58.231 --> 10:01.266
AND WE HAD A LOT OF
GOOD, SMART PEOPLE

10:01.268 --> 10:02.534
WORKING THAT
PROBLEM, BUT IN

10:02.536 --> 10:04.936
A FEW KEY MOMENTS,
WE WAITED.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.705
WE WERE TOO CAUTIOUS.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.940
THERE WAS
RED TAPE EVERYWHERE.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.108
I DON'T WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN HERE

10:10.110 --> 10:12.577
AND I DON'T WANT IT
TO HAPPEN TO YOUR CITY,

10:12.579 --> 10:13.979
NOT ON MY WATCH.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.348
SO, CHEER UP, MAJOR.

10:17.117 --> 10:22.487
YOU'RE GETTING FOOD
TO YOUR PEOPLE TOMORROW.

10:22.489 --> 10:23.989
JAKE: TOMORROW:
LEX: TOMORROW.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.457
THERE'S NO WAY.
NO WAY.

10:25.459 --> 10:26.791
I NEED AT LEAST
A WEEK IN HERE

10:26.793 --> 10:28.560
TO SET UP STATIONS
AND CROWD CONTROL.

10:28.562 --> 10:31.463
AND AN UNLOADING ZONE
AND A DISTRIBUTION CENTER,

10:31.465 --> 10:33.465
BUT WE DON'T HAVE A WEEK.

10:33.467 --> 10:34.666
CAN YOU MAKE IT WORK?

10:34.668 --> 10:36.234
HA! HELL NO.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.003
NEITHER CAN I,
BUT WE'RE GONNA.

10:38.005 --> 10:40.772
SPRING STREET
CROSSES DIRECTLY OVER
LINDEN TRAIN STATION.

10:40.774 --> 10:43.241
THE LOCATION
SHOULD PROVIDE
A GOOD PERIMETER.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.676
MY TEAM WILL DELIVER
THE FOOD TO YOU.

10:44.678 --> 10:47.912
YOUR TEAM WILL
CONTROL DISTRIBUTION.

10:47.914 --> 10:48.780
ANYTHING ELSE?

10:48.782 --> 10:50.582
ACTUALLY, YEAH.
THERE IS A KID

10:50.584 --> 10:52.083
WHO BROKE IN
RECENTLY.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.185
NAME'S XANDER.
AFRICAN-AMERICAN,

10:54.187 --> 10:55.487
ABOUT 18.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.489
IF YOU COME ACROSS
HIM, JUST KNOW
HE'S A GOOD KID.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.824
WHAT KNUCKLEHEAD
BREAKS INTO
A QUARANTINE?

10:59.826 --> 11:01.626
HIS GIRLFRIEND'S
ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH.

11:01.628 --> 11:04.362
YOU'RE GONNA ASK ME
TO DELIVER THE BABY, TOO?

11:05.298 --> 11:07.866
HEY, JANA GOT
A MESSAGE TO ME.

11:08.502 --> 11:09.934
SHE'S DOING OK.

11:09.936 --> 11:11.469
[SIGH] LEX,
I'M SORRY, MAN.

11:11.471 --> 11:14.272
I...I'M SORRY I
HAVEN'T CHECKED ON HER.

11:14.274 --> 11:17.008
IT'S BEEN KIND OF
ROUGH THE LAST
FEW DAYS AND--

11:17.010 --> 11:18.677
IF I DON'T SEE
HER AT THE DROP,

11:18.679 --> 11:21.780
I'M GONNA BRING
THE FOOD TO HER
MYSELF, ALL RIGHT?

11:22.849 --> 11:28.186
WHEN YOU SEE HER, UM,
AHEM, GIVE HER THIS.

11:29.623 --> 11:30.622
IT'S A KEY TO MY HOUSE.

11:30.624 --> 11:34.459
I USED TO LEAVE IT
UNDER THE MAT FOR HER.

11:35.796 --> 11:38.229
WH-WHAT GOOD IS IT
GONNA DO HER NOW?

11:38.231 --> 11:42.033
IT'S A LITTLE METAPHOR
CALLED HOPE, YOU IDIOT.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.869
JUST GIVE IT TO HER,
ALL RIGHT?

11:44.871 --> 11:46.771
YEAH, OK, ROMEO.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.742

12:09.062 --> 12:11.496
JANA: WHAT DO YOU
THINK IS GOING ON
DOWN THERE?

12:11.498 --> 12:13.898
GOOD AFTERNOON.
I'M PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE

12:13.900 --> 12:17.335
THAT IN COORDINATION
WITH FEDERAL, STATE,
AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES,

12:17.337 --> 12:19.237
WE WILL BE DELIVERING
A MAJOR FOOD SUPPLY

12:19.239 --> 12:22.674
IN THE CORDON...
I GOT FIRST DIBS
ON THE PRIME RIB.

12:22.676 --> 12:23.942
OH, YEAH?
GONNA GET IT?

12:23.944 --> 12:26.778
DENNIS: UH-UH.
TONY AND I WENT OUT
THE LAST TIME.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.780
FAIR IS FAIR.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.915
LOMMERS: WE ASK THAT YOU ARRIVE
AT THE LOCATION

12:30.917 --> 12:34.919
NO SOONER THAN 30 MINUTES
BEFORE YOUR ASSIGNED TIME.

12:34.921 --> 12:35.954
REMEMBER...

12:35.956 --> 12:38.423
SUZY: WE'RE REALLY
GOING OUT TO THAT?

12:40.293 --> 12:41.793
WE AREN'T.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.928
I'M GONNA
DO IT ALONE.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.430
NO!
SOOZ...

12:45.432 --> 12:46.564
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
DOWN THERE

12:46.566 --> 12:48.233
FOR ONE WOMAN,
MUCH LESS TWO.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.802
I CAN'T LET YOU
GO BY YOURSELF.

12:50.804 --> 12:53.838
LET DENNIS
OR TONY HELP.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.676
YOU WERE SAYING?

13:08.155 --> 13:10.021
MAN: ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
LET'S GO.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.625
I WAS PROMISED
TWO PEOPLE TO
WORK THIS CRANE.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.894
I NEED SOMEONE
TO ASSIST
THE OPERATOR.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.446
I GOT EXPERIENCE
IN THAT.

13:17.447 --> 13:18.997
USED TO WORK CONSTRUCTION
AFTER HIGH SCHOOL.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.732
ALL RIGHT, MEESE.
YOU'RE ON CRANE DUTY.

13:20.734 --> 13:22.000
I APPRECIATE YOU
STEPPING UP.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.468
I COULD USE THE
SPECIALTY PAY.

13:23.470 --> 13:26.171
YOU MEAN YOUR BOOKIE
COULD USE IT.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.139
LISTEN UP.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.974
WE'RE ON
A TIGHT SCHEDULE.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.076
SO, I NEED EVERYONE
TO HELP OUT

13:32.078 --> 13:33.278

THAT'S A TOTAL OF
20 DROPS.

13:46.159 --> 13:49.160
I NEED EVERYTHING
DOWN THERE
IN PLENTY OF TIME

13:49.162 --> 13:50.028
FOR JAKE AND HIS MEN

13:50.030 --> 13:53.031

DISTRIBUTE THE FOOD.

IS HE?

15:26.927 --> 15:28.126
HE KNOWS I
NEED HIM HERE.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.762
I DON'T KNOW.
HE WASN'T AT
ROLL CALL.

15:34.534 --> 15:37.101

WHAT WE KNOW

16:32.826 --> 16:36.027
ABOUT A VACCINE
VERSUS A TREATMENT?

16:36.029 --> 16:38.296
YOU NEED A VACCINE
BEFORE YOU GET SICK.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.497
RIGHT.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.000
WHY DIDN'T THE
DOCTORS WHO DIED
HAVE VACCINES?

16:42.002 --> 16:45.169
WELL, THEY DIDN'T KNOW
THE VIRUS EXISTED YET.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.205
DR. CANNERTS WORKS
IN THE OFFICE

HELEN HAVE TO SAY?

16:54.481 --> 16:56.180
SHE SAID THE DOCTOR
LIKED TO HAVE A QUICKIE

WAS DR. SANDERS?

17:14.067 --> 17:17.235
OK. THAT'S
VERY INTERESTING.

17:17.237 --> 17:18.669
WHY?

17:18.671 --> 17:20.972
BECAUSE DR. SANDERS WAS SUPPOSED
TO TAKE US FOR OUR TOUR

17:20.974 --> 17:23.074

-TELL HIM HOW TO GET OUT.
-I CAN'T.

-WHY THE HELL NOT?
-BECAUSE HE'S CUT HIMSELF

CAME INTO CONTACT WITH.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.850
I BREAK THE RULES
AS MUCH AS ONCE

19:12.852 --> 19:15.119
AND THIS ALL
GOES TO HELL.

UNDERSTAND ME?
