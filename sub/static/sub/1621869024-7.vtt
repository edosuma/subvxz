WEBVTT

00:16.683 --> 00:18.644
Have you sorted out Karen's hen do yet?

00:18.727 --> 00:20.020
Yeah, I think so.

00:20.604 --> 00:23.065
It's tricky though, 'cause
I'm scared of checking my emails,

00:23.148 --> 00:24.816
'cause I know there's gonna be
bad news about the kids,

00:24.900 --> 00:25.984
-so...
-Yeah.

00:26.610 --> 00:29.071
-What you gonna do for Scott?
-Just gonna go pub.

00:29.696 --> 00:30.989
-Is that it?
-Well...

00:31.073 --> 00:32.073
Jase.

00:32.156 --> 00:34.993
How is that different from
any other time you go to the pub?

00:35.077 --> 00:36.954
-Scott's coming.
-Jason.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.581
It's a bit weird, innit?
I didn't ask to be his best man.

00:39.665 --> 00:40.999
I've only known the fella 18 months.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.751
Yeah, he doesn't have many friends,
does he?

00:42.835 --> 00:43.836
Obviously not.

00:43.919 --> 00:46.338
That's what you get when you
pronounce it "choritho."

00:47.005 --> 00:49.675
He's given me a list of three people
that he wants to invite.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.802
One of them is his barber.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.222
He couldn't even remember who Scott was.

00:55.305 --> 00:57.099
I had to describe
the back of his head to the guy.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.101
It's true.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.537
Hello?

01:18.620 --> 01:19.621
Yeah, yeah.

01:21.123 --> 01:23.584
All right. Okay.

01:34.678 --> 01:37.764
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:37.848 --> 01:39.266
Jason!

01:39.850 --> 01:41.018
Jason!

01:41.101 --> 01:43.979
-Look.
-All right then. Thank you. Bye-bye.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.981
I don't believe it! I got the promotion!

01:46.064 --> 01:48.025
I got the promotion! I got the promotion!

01:52.237 --> 01:54.281
-What?
-We didn't get the kids.

02:02.414 --> 02:03.498
You need to go.

02:03.582 --> 02:05.209
-We need to talk about what this means.
-No, we don't.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.127
-Yeah, but does this mean--
-Doesn't mean anything.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.422
This is not an emotional thing.
This is just--

02:11.173 --> 02:12.382
It's just atoms.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.594
And at one point,
the atoms were in a certain position,

02:15.677 --> 02:18.055
and then they moved
and they were in a different position.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.850
On top of each other.
But it is just atoms.

02:21.934 --> 02:25.020
It doesn't-- Do not add emotion to atoms.

02:28.232 --> 02:29.233
Fine.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.611
-What you doing?
-Going to the toilet.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.112
-Freddy.
-I'm bursting.

02:35.531 --> 02:37.574
-All right. Don't let Lauren see you.
-I won't.

02:44.706 --> 02:45.874
-Daddy!
-Oh, f--

02:45.958 --> 02:47.251
Hi, darling.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.214
How long have we been here now?

02:54.007 --> 02:55.133
About four minutes.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.387
Really? Feels like longer.

02:59.429 --> 03:00.430
I know.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.561
I miss "five minutes ago" us.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.021
Yep.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.527
Plenty more kids out there for us,
Nikki, you know?

03:13.610 --> 03:14.945
Yeah.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.156
Did they not just feel
like the ones though?

03:22.536 --> 03:23.912
-Can you not see there?
-What?

03:23.996 --> 03:25.372
Can you not see them? There. Look.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.499
-What? Here?
-In the distance, there. Our kids. Look.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.418
Can't you see them?

03:30.669 --> 03:31.712
No.

03:34.173 --> 03:36.049
That's because you're very short.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.301
-Is that why?
-Yeah.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.386
So you can't see over the horizon.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.470
Look.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.558
Can you see them now?

03:45.684 --> 03:48.020
-Yeah. I can.
-Yeah? What do you reckon?

03:48.729 --> 03:50.731
-They're very cute.
-They're lovely, ain't they?

03:52.232 --> 03:53.233
Yeah.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.616
I quite like it up here, you know?

04:01.950 --> 04:03.493
Can you not carry me around all day?

04:03.994 --> 04:05.162
-No.
-Why?

04:05.245 --> 04:07.372
-You're actually heavier than you look.
-You're cheeky.

04:07.456 --> 04:08.540
-Oi.
-What?

04:08.624 --> 04:10.876
-Mrs. Manager.
-I know!

04:10.959 --> 04:12.377
-I know. Yeah.
-All right, I tell you what then.

04:12.461 --> 04:14.588
Show me your best manager point.

04:14.671 --> 04:15.881
-That's easy.
-Okay.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.801
-Okay.
-Jase, that's really good pointing.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.345
No. You've gone a bit disco there.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.222
You've gone
a little bit Saturday Night Fever.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.389
Right, you wanna trust me.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.308
-Yeah?
-I've been a manager for six weeks, okay?

04:26.391 --> 04:28.185
-So you know.
-So, it's more like this.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.895
-All right. Yeah.
-Oh, turning. Okay.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.231
It's your turn. Yeah, nearly. Ready?

04:32.314 --> 04:33.315
Okay.

04:34.525 --> 04:35.776
Wow.

04:36.318 --> 04:37.694
You're ready.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.696
You're good to go.

04:49.831 --> 04:50.666
Here you go.

04:50.749 --> 04:51.750
Thanks.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.129
Where did you go?

04:56.922 --> 04:58.131
My mum's.

04:59.424 --> 05:03.220
Look, I'm sorry. It just--
It wasn't right.

05:05.097 --> 05:07.850
So I am being dismissed by Miss Newman?

05:07.933 --> 05:09.810
Well, it should never have happened.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.061
It didn't happen.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.397
You're ending an affair
that never started.

05:14.439 --> 05:17.442
-Are you gonna be able to get over me?
-Well...

05:18.485 --> 05:20.821
At least there's drawings of you
all over my house.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.322
That'll help.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.867
It's a shame though.

05:24.950 --> 05:28.328
I literally just decided you were worth
pissing off my parents for.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.124
On the plus side,

05:32.207 --> 05:35.127
I got a feeling Raina's gonna get
a good end of term report.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.546
No, Deven.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.214
That is not how I do things.

05:40.090 --> 05:43.010
And she has a few things to work on, so...

05:55.147 --> 05:56.148
Hiya.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.193
Scott?

06:44.112 --> 06:45.113
Kaz?

07:04.925 --> 07:07.219
So, how come you needed an alibi?
What was that about?

07:07.302 --> 07:10.180
It's fine.
It was just a miscommunication thing.

07:10.264 --> 07:13.016
Yeah, but Karen,
who were you miscommunicating with though?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.685
I'm sorry, but what is this?

07:14.768 --> 07:20.399
Okay. I figured out what you'd love most
by thinking what Erica would hate most.

07:20.482 --> 07:21.733
I hope it's got a bar. What a joke.

07:25.654 --> 07:27.239
Oh, my God.

07:28.282 --> 07:30.951
-Oh, my God. I bloody love it! Yes!
-Yes!

07:31.660 --> 07:33.412
-You beauty!
-Yeah.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.330
Hello there. Hi, are you in charge?

07:35.414 --> 07:37.165
Is this what you thought it was?

07:37.249 --> 07:39.376
Yes, Mum! She'll love it!

07:39.960 --> 07:42.462
-Okay. As long as you meant it.
-Yeah.

07:44.590 --> 07:47.718
On our hens, we just used to
have a sherry and a little cry.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.304
Right. Well, there's absolutely no chance

07:50.387 --> 07:52.472
of anyone putting their hand
down my top here, is there?

07:52.556 --> 07:54.183
Complete waste of my time.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.810
-I got a babysitter for this?
-I got a wax.

07:56.894 --> 07:59.271
You'll be more aerodynamic then,
won't you?

08:05.444 --> 08:06.570
There we are.

08:09.573 --> 08:10.866
How long you been barbering, Yusuf?

08:10.949 --> 08:12.451
Eight years in Turkey.

08:12.534 --> 08:15.120
Four years here. Not happy.

08:15.204 --> 08:16.330
No?

08:17.664 --> 08:18.665
Okay.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.710
But thanks for coming.

08:21.793 --> 08:24.630
No, I want to.
Things are not good at home.

08:27.633 --> 08:28.759
What grade is that?

08:28.842 --> 08:31.178
-It was a four, I think.
-No, no.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.472
It makes your head look big, man.
Like pumpkin.

08:33.554 --> 08:36.015
Okay, good. I'm just gonna
get some shots here, all right?

08:36.099 --> 08:38.727
Let's at least take our coats off.
Bloody hell, lads.

08:38.809 --> 08:43.190
Hello, mate.
Can I have four shots of tequila, please?

09:00.999 --> 09:03.001
Hello? No. Hold on.

09:03.085 --> 09:05.462
Hold on. Hold on.

09:07.089 --> 09:08.632
-Yes.
-Hi, babe. It's me.

09:08.715 --> 09:09.967
-I need your help.
-Why? What's happened?

09:10.050 --> 09:13.303
Well, I've Jason'd it
and I should've Nikki'd it.

09:13.387 --> 09:16.849
And now it's like the worst stag do ever
and Scott seems really upset.

09:16.932 --> 09:19.101
Well, what do you want me to do about it?

09:19.184 --> 09:21.436
Can we have
one of your activities, please?

09:21.520 --> 09:23.272
-No! They're mine!
-Oh, come on.

09:23.355 --> 09:25.274
-Where are you now?
-Go-karting.

09:25.357 --> 09:26.483
Go-karting! That sounds amazing.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.235
I'd love to go--
Where you going afterwards?

09:29.236 --> 09:30.529
Graffiti workshop.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.239
Okay, can we have
the graffiti workshop, please?

09:32.322 --> 09:33.866
No! We want graffiti.

09:33.949 --> 09:36.368
Look, you're going go-karting
and then a graffiti workshop.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.328
That's two arm things.
Your arms are gonna get tired.

09:38.871 --> 09:41.039
Okay, fine. But you pay for graffiti.

09:41.123 --> 09:42.833
-And another session here.
-Yes.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.543
Thank you so much, Nikki. I love you.

09:44.626 --> 09:45.711
It's booked for 11 people.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.339
That could be a bit of a stretch, but...

09:49.423 --> 09:50.632
Okay, bye.

09:51.425 --> 09:52.968
All right. We ready?

09:53.051 --> 09:54.970
-Yes!
-Yeah? Come on!

09:56.471 --> 09:57.472
Let's go.

09:57.556 --> 09:58.557
Come on. Come on.

09:58.974 --> 09:59.850
Go.

10:01.310 --> 10:03.562
Okay, racers, we go on green.

10:07.149 --> 10:08.567
Are you ready, Mum?

10:09.651 --> 10:10.944
I'm in the zone, love!

10:11.987 --> 10:13.113
All right.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.201
Oi! Why you being weird?

10:17.284 --> 10:18.368
It's nothing.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.704
Okay. Fine.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.790
-I slept with Freddy.
-What? Why?

10:23.874 --> 10:25.000
I don't wanna talk about it.

10:25.584 --> 10:26.668
Erica, what are you--

10:26.752 --> 10:28.003
-Hey, Nikki.
-What?

10:28.086 --> 10:30.964
-I'm thinking of calling off the wedding.
-What?

10:31.048 --> 10:32.591
-Karen!
-And we're off.

10:32.674 --> 10:33.884
Karen!

10:34.760 --> 10:36.803
Wait! Wait!

10:38.347 --> 10:40.432
Wait! Wait!

10:49.149 --> 10:52.194
Graffiti, yeah?
The language of the disenfranchised.

10:52.277 --> 10:55.322
Right, this one costs 69 quid a pop,
so these lot are pretty franchised.

10:56.198 --> 10:57.574
Thanks for coming, Dad.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.660
Your mum says I've got to do
one new thing every day

10:59.743 --> 11:02.412
so if I do this,
I don't have to eat the moussaka.

11:03.622 --> 11:04.623
That's the spirit.

11:20.806 --> 11:22.182
Yeah!

11:22.266 --> 11:23.559
Oh, for God's sake.

11:31.608 --> 11:32.985
This is so fun!

11:33.068 --> 11:34.486
What are you doing?

11:35.028 --> 11:36.071
Look, it's not what you think.

11:36.154 --> 11:38.866
I slept with him
as a father, not as a man.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.826
And why you calling off the wedding?

11:40.909 --> 11:42.327
-What?
-I don't know!

11:42.411 --> 11:43.495
You calling off the wedding?

11:43.579 --> 11:45.455
You're calling off the wedding?
Can I get changed?

11:45.539 --> 11:46.748
-No!
-Is it 'cause of Deven?

11:46.832 --> 11:48.250
Absolutely not!

11:48.333 --> 11:50.627
-Who's Deven?
-And we're off!

11:50.711 --> 11:52.838
Oh, God! Will you stop doing that?

11:55.424 --> 11:56.425
Bloody hell!

12:00.387 --> 12:02.681
The theme today for you is love.

12:02.764 --> 12:05.559
Remember, everyone, to follow your passion

12:05.642 --> 12:07.227
and be free with your art.

12:07.311 --> 12:10.898
But also, remember, please,
to put the lids back on the cans.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.358
You are having too many head thoughts.

12:13.442 --> 12:15.235
You need some gut thoughts.

12:15.319 --> 12:16.737
Listen to what it's telling you.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.405
-Just don't overthink it.
-Don't overthink it.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.037
Bloody hell, that's coming on,
innit, John?

12:25.370 --> 12:27.331
It's getting there, Jason.
It's getting there.

12:28.582 --> 12:31.376
Grasmere looking down
from Loughrigg Terrace.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.754
You avoid a lot of the mist
you get up at Castlerigg.

12:39.885 --> 12:40.928
How you getting on, Dad?

12:41.011 --> 12:42.679
Nah, I've lost it.

12:42.763 --> 12:44.723
-It's got away from me.
-What is it, mate?

12:45.474 --> 12:46.475
Harry and Meghan.

12:55.234 --> 12:56.401
I have to tell you something.

12:57.528 --> 12:58.529
All right, go on then.

13:00.822 --> 13:01.823
Nah, don't worry.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.619
All right. Good chat.

13:09.540 --> 13:10.791
Karen!

13:10.874 --> 13:13.418
-What you doing?
-Would you just bloody talk to me?

13:13.502 --> 13:14.753
-Pull over!
-What? No!

13:14.837 --> 13:16.171
Karen, pull over!

13:16.255 --> 13:17.339
No!

13:17.422 --> 13:19.842
-Just stop, Karen! Pull over!
-What you doing?

13:19.925 --> 13:21.593
Pull over now, Kare--

13:23.971 --> 13:26.098
-Hey.
-What's going on?

13:26.765 --> 13:29.434
-I found his wedding vows.
-All right.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.603
They were from a template.

13:34.565 --> 13:35.607
Okay.

13:37.067 --> 13:40.195
That's all right.
Loads of people use them.

13:40.279 --> 13:43.615
What, those seven special words
every woman wants to hear?

13:43.699 --> 13:46.410
"My life changed on 'enter date here.'"

13:47.578 --> 13:49.913
He's supposed to be a writer.

13:50.581 --> 13:52.916
Yeah, but he's not a very good one, is he?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.043
Yeah, but that's the thing, isn't it?

13:55.127 --> 13:56.461
He thinks he is.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.882
If he's not even self-aware,
how is he gonna be me-aware?

13:59.965 --> 14:00.799
Watch out!

14:05.637 --> 14:07.306
-For God's sake!
-What's going on?

14:07.848 --> 14:10.267
We are going to get a drink.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.227
-Finally. Right.
-Thank God.

14:12.311 --> 14:13.478
Come on. Let's go.

14:14.438 --> 14:18.358
No! No, guys. I didn't plan for this.

14:19.151 --> 14:21.278
It's not on the email!

14:36.335 --> 14:37.336
Is it a satire?

14:38.337 --> 14:40.422
No. It's just a unicorn in a hat.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.095
Hello, mate. You all right?

14:47.179 --> 14:48.180
Yeah.

14:50.098 --> 14:51.850
No. Actually, no, I'm not.

14:52.476 --> 14:53.685
Mate, I...

14:56.146 --> 14:57.564
I slept with Erica.

14:58.982 --> 15:01.276
And now I don't know
what to do about Harper.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.447
-Right.
-Yeah.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.493
-So, what do you wanna do?
-I don't know.

15:10.202 --> 15:13.705
I mean, she's great,
but she's not my wife.

15:15.082 --> 15:17.626
Maybe you should get her
a card with that on it.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.002
Sorry.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.587
Sorry. Go on.

15:21.338 --> 15:25.509
Seriously. Maybe if we gave it time,
we could really be something.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.262
Yeah, but, Freddy, do you not think
you maybe want it to be something

15:28.345 --> 15:31.348
so then you haven't, you know,
left your wife and kids for nothing?

15:31.431 --> 15:32.599
Do you think I love her?

15:32.683 --> 15:34.518
I don't. No.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.353
'Cause I don't think
that that is what love is.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.897
-What is it then?
-I don't know. It's not that, is it?

15:40.399 --> 15:41.483
It's peace.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.610
You know when a sound

15:43.694 --> 15:46.154
that you didn't know was there
suddenly stops, right?

15:46.238 --> 15:49.616
And then you get this second
of, like, exquisite peace.

15:51.368 --> 15:53.078
Yeah? It's like that.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.330
But all the time.

15:57.082 --> 15:59.334
Or maybe I'm just high
off whatever's in these cans.

16:04.298 --> 16:07.176
Is that what that is then? Peace?

16:07.718 --> 16:08.719
No.

16:10.304 --> 16:12.306
That's because I don't know
where I end and she begins.

16:15.517 --> 16:18.145
I mean, it hasn't totally come together
as I would've hoped.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.989
Do you wanna talk about it? Or--

16:29.072 --> 16:32.201
No, I just need some time
to think about things.

16:32.284 --> 16:33.535
Okay.

16:34.119 --> 16:36.455
Do you think that's gonna be
more or less than a week?

16:36.538 --> 16:38.457
Because obviously
that's when the wedding is--

16:38.540 --> 16:40.542
I don't know, Nikki.

16:44.546 --> 16:47.424
You know how sometimes
you see a bright star better

16:47.508 --> 16:48.842
if you look away slightly?

16:49.927 --> 16:51.512
I think Scott is like that.

16:52.095 --> 16:55.641
So I'm just gonna look away for a bit
and then look back really quickly,

16:55.724 --> 16:57.184
and I will see it all.

16:59.144 --> 17:01.021
-Yeah, I've seen your wrist.
-Okay.

17:01.104 --> 17:03.023
-Wristband?
-We going to the pub.

17:03.106 --> 17:04.107
All right, good.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.026
-Hi!
-Thank you.

17:11.448 --> 17:14.576
These last few months have been so great.

17:14.660 --> 17:19.623
I just think that you are this amazing
and courageous person.

17:19.705 --> 17:23.042
And you live so bravely and so boldly.

17:23.126 --> 17:25.503
And when you laugh, it's this full--

17:25.587 --> 17:27.964
If you're gonna break up with me,
do you wanna just--

17:28.048 --> 17:31.426
'Cause this is seriously an insane
amount of time to talk at a person.

17:33.011 --> 17:34.054
Okay.

17:35.514 --> 17:37.349
Okay. Well, then,

17:38.141 --> 17:42.145
I think it would be for the best
if we broke up.

17:42.229 --> 17:43.772
-But I hope you're not...
-Okay.

17:44.815 --> 17:45.899
...too upset.

17:45.983 --> 17:46.984
Clearly not.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.151
Have you seen Scott?

17:48.944 --> 17:50.529
-What?
-Have you seen Scott?

17:52.030 --> 17:53.031
No.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.255
Kaz?

18:12.968 --> 18:14.678
Yeah, no, it's sticky.

18:21.185 --> 18:24.188
I'm trying to look back and see it all.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.272
Yeah?

18:26.356 --> 18:27.357
But I can't.

18:27.441 --> 18:29.443
Maybe it'll come when you least expect it.

18:29.526 --> 18:31.612
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Come here.

18:40.162 --> 18:42.164
How does Jason make you feel?

18:42.247 --> 18:44.208
I don't know, Kaz.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.667
Come on.

18:49.463 --> 18:52.925
So much noise going around my head.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.093
About everything.

18:56.386 --> 18:59.306
Took me three months to decide
whether to buy these shoes.

19:00.474 --> 19:02.392
I went into the shop seven times.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.812
Became friends with the assistant.
I went to see her band play.

19:09.608 --> 19:12.402
I doubt every decision I make.

19:13.695 --> 19:18.075
All these questions
just swirl around in my head.

19:19.576 --> 19:21.537
Except with him.

19:22.204 --> 19:24.039
With him, when I met him...

19:26.834 --> 19:28.836
All the questions just stopped.

19:30.379 --> 19:33.298
And now I just--
I can't imagine him not being there.

19:38.136 --> 19:39.638
If Scott wasn't there...

19:42.724 --> 19:43.934
How would I feel?

19:48.105 --> 19:49.439
I don't know, Kaz.

20:15.716 --> 20:16.884
White wine, please.

20:38.447 --> 20:40.449
That's Lauren. She's nine.

20:40.991 --> 20:43.535
Oh, my God. Look at them.

20:43.619 --> 20:44.912
They're so cute.

20:44.995 --> 20:46.288
I know.

20:46.371 --> 20:51.043
They just grow up so slowly.

20:53.003 --> 20:54.922
Has anyone seen Karen?

20:55.797 --> 20:57.090
-Karen.
-No.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.150
Scott.

21:26.995 --> 21:27.996
Scott?

21:33.585 --> 21:34.962
Scott, are you here?

21:37.089 --> 21:38.841
Oh, God, no.

21:38.924 --> 21:39.842
Oh, my God.

21:44.471 --> 21:45.472
God.

21:46.682 --> 21:48.392
Oh, Jesus Christ.

21:48.475 --> 21:50.310
It was in a box in the garage.

21:50.394 --> 21:52.354
Sorry, looking everywhere.

21:53.272 --> 21:54.314
For what?

22:07.369 --> 22:08.453
I thought you'd left.

22:09.371 --> 22:10.539
No.

22:10.622 --> 22:12.791
No. Here I be.

22:14.668 --> 22:15.669
Come here.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.384
Everything okay?

22:23.051 --> 22:24.178
Yeah, yeah.

22:26.555 --> 22:28.682
It's just been really noisy tonight.

22:30.893 --> 22:32.227
The peace is nice.

22:36.398 --> 22:37.482
Listen...

22:39.151 --> 22:43.655
I wanted to thank you
for putting up with...

22:45.199 --> 22:46.658
You know, all of this.

22:49.328 --> 22:50.454
What do you mean?

22:51.455 --> 22:54.249
Well, I know
that I'm not everybody's cup of tea.

22:54.333 --> 22:55.542
Don't say that.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.545
Kaz, there were three people
at my stag do.

22:59.922 --> 23:03.133
I might not be the most self-aware person
in the world, but I know how to count.

23:06.053 --> 23:07.095
And it's fine. I get it.

23:07.179 --> 23:10.432
-I mean, I am a joke to most people.
-You--

23:10.516 --> 23:12.684
I mean, it's-- You know, I'm pretentious.

23:12.768 --> 23:16.230
I use big, fancy words
when they're not strictly perimetric,

23:16.313 --> 23:19.149
but I look at you...

23:21.568 --> 23:23.779
And I think, "I can't be that bad, can I?"

23:24.988 --> 23:26.031
If you're with me.

23:29.868 --> 23:31.370
I know how lucky I am.

23:39.795 --> 23:43.048
I've been making
some bad choices recently,

23:43.131 --> 23:44.716
and I really think we need
to talk about it.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.385
You don't have-- It's--

23:47.302 --> 23:49.263
I think that would be supererogatory.

24:01.149 --> 24:02.401
What does that mean?

24:03.694 --> 24:05.696
-All right?
-Yeah, she's home.

24:06.905 --> 24:09.575
-What's she gonna do?
-I don't know, Jase.

24:11.577 --> 24:14.413
Tonight, I was Karen and she was me,

24:14.496 --> 24:17.207
and I'm gonna have to start being
a lot nicer to her,

24:17.291 --> 24:19.751
because it is much harder than it looks.

24:22.713 --> 24:23.755
Are we okay?

24:24.423 --> 24:25.424
Yeah.

24:28.510 --> 24:29.511
No.

24:31.680 --> 24:32.931
But we will be.

24:33.765 --> 24:34.766
We always are.

24:34.850 --> 24:36.768
Yeah. We always are.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.482
Will you lift me up again, please?

24:45.944 --> 24:46.987
Go on then.

24:53.202 --> 24:54.953
-It's peaceful.
-Yeah.

24:58.999 --> 25:01.084
Don't forget you still
owe me for graffiti.

25:01.168 --> 25:03.003
What? Are you really gonna
charge me for that?

25:03.086 --> 25:04.713
Yeah, of course I am.

25:32.950 --> 25:34.618
-Okay.
-In the water!

25:34.701 --> 25:35.744
No!

25:38.038 --> 25:39.540
-Can we go home?
-Yes, please.

26:05.315 --> 26:07.526
Twenty, 40, 60...

26:10.529 --> 26:11.738
Yeah, and the rest.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.241
Thank you. There.
