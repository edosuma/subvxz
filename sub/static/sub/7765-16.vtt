AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA
RUIN THE SURPRISE!

01:12.080 --> 01:14.500
WHAT?
IT SOUNDS
A LITTLE INTENSE.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.600
AND WHY'S IT GOT TO
BE A SURPRISE?

01:15.880 --> 01:17.880
IS IT A SPECIAL OCCASION
OR SOMETHING?

01:17.480 --> 01:18.660
NO,
AND THAT'S THE POINT.

01:18.760 --> 01:20.620
SHE'D BE EXPECTING SOMETHING
IF IT WAS.

01:20.720 --> 01:22.180
I'VE MADE HER LAUGH, CRY,

01:22.280 --> 01:24.280
SCREAM WITH TERROR WHEN
SHE FELL INTO THAT CAVE HOLE.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.740
ALL THE BIG EMOTIONS.

01:25.840 --> 01:28.220
BUT SHE'S TOO SMART
TO BE SURPRISED.
NO WAY.

01:28.320 --> 01:30.140
IF THERE'S A MYSTERY,
SHE HAS TO SOLVE IT.

01:30.240 --> 01:31.780

TO SURPRISE EILEEN,

01:31.880 --> 01:33.880

( Cockney accent )
GOOD EVENING, MY LADY.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.540
I'M 'ERE TO WARN YOU
THAT TROUBLE'S AFOOT.

01:37.640 --> 01:38.900
YOU SEE,
THERE'S BEEN A MURââ

01:39.000 --> 01:41.540
AAH! YOU'RE TAKING ME TO
A MURDER MYSTERY, RIGHT?

01:41.640 --> 01:43.260

01:57.520 --> 01:58.940
SHE'S SMART LIKE THAT,
DUDE.

01:59.040 --> 02:02.420
SO I THOUGHT UP A PLAN SO CRAZY
SHE'LL NEVER FIGURE IT OUT.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.520
WILL YOU GUYS HELP
DRIVE US AROUND?

02:03.720 --> 02:05.420
DUDE,
YOU'RE BEING KIND OF CRAZY,

02:05.520 --> 02:07.420

IT'S A NICE KIND OF CRAZY.

02:07.520 --> 02:10.260
I THINK THAT'S SWEET, RIGBY.
OF COURSE WE'LL HELP YOU.

COMBINED WITH FORMAL JACKET
AND CORSAGE,

02:38.400 --> 02:41.260

THAT'S THE MOST FUN PARTY
OF THE YEAR!

02:43.880 --> 02:45.980
OH, EILEEN,

02:46.080 --> 02:48.660
I HAVE A DIFFERENT SURPRISE
IN STORE FOR YOU.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.180
AND THIS TIME, YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA BE ABLE TO GUESS IT.

02:51.280 --> 02:53.060
NOW, DITCH THE APRON.
WE'RE HEADING OUT.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.660
WAIT,
BUT I STILL HAVE TO WORK.

02:54.760 --> 02:57.420
TALKED TO YOUR BOSS.
IT'S TAKEN CARE OF.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.780
HEY.
50 YEARS FROM NOW,

02:59.880 --> 03:01.860
ARE YOU GONNA REMEMBER
BUSSING TABLES

03:01.960 --> 03:04.500
OR THE GREATEST ADVENTURE
OF YOUR LIFE?

03:04.600 --> 03:06.860
NOW, GET OUT OF HERE,
YOU CRAZY KIDS.

03:06.960 --> 03:08.580
RIGBY,
I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS.

03:08.680 --> 03:09.820
HE'S A GUY WHO GETS IT.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.920
BUT DON'T WORRY.
I DID TALK TO YOUR BOSS.

03:11.560 --> 03:13.420
HMM.

03:13.520 --> 03:16.500
IF IT'S NOT BEACH PROM,
ARE WE GOING TO COSTA RICA?

03:16.600 --> 03:18.660
NO NEED TO GUESS.
JUST ENJOY THE SURPRISE.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.860
MAYBE YOUR OUTFIT
IS A RED HERRING.

03:20.960 --> 03:24.060

03:27.320 --> 03:30.980
BUT THAT COULD ALSO BE A RED
HERRING OF SAID RED HERRING,

03:31.080 --> 03:33.780
MEANING...BEACH PROM!

03:33.880 --> 03:35.880
JUST GET IN THE CAR!

I'D SAY WE'RE ABOUT 15 MILES
OUTSIDE OF DOWNTOWN,

03:40.320 --> 03:41.940
HEADING NORTHWEST.

03:42.040 --> 03:45.820
THE TEMPERATURE HAS DROPPED
APPROXIMATELY THREE DEGREES,

03:45.920 --> 03:48.060
WHICH PUTS US
NEAR THAT SHOE STORE I LIKE.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.780
BUT...

03:49.880 --> 03:52.860
YEP, WE'D OVERSHOOT IT
BY ABOUT 900 FEET.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.100
AH! SEA TURTLE FAN CLUB!

03:55.200 --> 03:57.980

04:25.920 --> 04:27.920
YOU'RE BUILDING A HOTâAIR
BALLOON WITH ALL THIS STUFF

04:27.440 --> 04:28.900
FOR US TO RIDE IN.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.420
THAT STUFF'S FOR A BIRTHDAY
AT THE PARK LATER,

04:31.520 --> 04:33.420
WHICH YOU GUYS
BETTER BE BACK FOR.

04:33.520 --> 04:36.020
I'M NOT WORKING IT BY MYSELF
AFTER LAST TIME.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.120
LOOK, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THAT BRUSH FIRE,

04:37.720 --> 04:39.720
BUT I DON'T THINK
WE'LL MAKE IT BACK IN TIME.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.280
RIGBY'S PLAN MIGHT LAST
ALL MONTH.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.340

RIGBY, I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS THE
BEST SURPRISE YOU'VE EVER DONE.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.620
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I WON'T FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS.

05:31.720 --> 05:35.320
WELL, YOU WON'T,
UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT'S THAT WAY!

05:39.080 --> 05:41.180
UH,
THAT SEEMS KIND OF SHADY.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.780
YEAH. VERY SHADY.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.300
IS THERE EVEN TIME?

05:44.400 --> 05:46.020
WE MIGHT NOT MAKE IT
IF WE GO THIS WAY.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.120
OH, NO. WE'LL MAKE IT.
TRUST ME.

05:54.160 --> 05:55.780

DO IS GONNA END SOON.

TO SEE THE SURPRISE.
