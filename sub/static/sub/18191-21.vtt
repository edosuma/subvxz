WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.302
- PREVIOUSLY ON
"CHASING LIFE"...
- AS YOU ALL KNOW,

00:02.335 --> 00:04.405
I HAD TO MAKE A DECISION
ON A NEW EDITOR-IN-CHIEF.

00:04.437 --> 00:07.508
- RAQUEL.
- SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE
PICKED UP ON THIS,

00:07.541 --> 00:09.343
BUT THE "POST"
IS IN TROUBLE.

00:09.377 --> 00:11.178
JUST BECAUSE
YOU GET ONE HOME RUN

00:11.211 --> 00:12.612
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU SIT ON THE BENCH NOW.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.381
Natalie:
DOMINIC AND I ARE
SEEING EACH OTHER.

00:14.414 --> 00:16.350
I SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE
TO ASK YOU FOR PERMISSION.

00:16.384 --> 00:17.451
WE'RE FAMILY!

00:17.484 --> 00:19.620
I ALREADY SPENT
22 YEARS OF MY LIFE

00:19.652 --> 00:23.157
FEELING LIKE I'M
LOSING A MAN TO YOU.
I'M NOT DOING IT AGAIN.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.158
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
AT FLIGHTS TO CLEVELAND?

00:25.192 --> 00:28.094
OH, WELL,
THERE'S A CONFERENCE ON
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ILLNESS.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.562
GEORGE IS
GIVING A TALK.

00:29.597 --> 00:32.066
YEAH, I JUST
WASN'T EXPECTING THIS.

00:32.098 --> 00:33.533
WE STILL NEED TO RUN
SOME MORE TESTS TO MAKE SURE

00:33.567 --> 00:35.034
YOU'RE THE BEST
POSSIBLE MATCH.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.771
- WHO'S THE PATIENT?
- I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.338
DID THOSE NUMBERS
STOP DROPPING?

00:38.371 --> 00:40.607
HI, APRIL.
IT'S DR. HAMBURG.

00:40.640 --> 00:41.808
UM, I WOULD LOVE
TO SEE YOU

00:42.042 --> 00:43.543
TOMORROW MORNING
FOR A FOLLOW-UP,

00:43.576 --> 00:45.780
SO GIVE ME A CALL
WHEN YOU GET THIS.

00:45.813 --> 00:48.182
I HOPE YOU HAVE
A GREAT NIGHT.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.518
Dr. Hamburg: APRIL.

00:55.256 --> 00:58.259
UH... BUT-- WHAT...

01:00.060 --> 01:03.097
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO,
YOU SAID YOU WERE 99% SURE

01:03.130 --> 01:06.534
IT HADN'T COME BACK.
HOW SURE ARE YOU NOW
THAT IT IS BACK?

01:08.168 --> 01:10.137
YOUR NUMBERS WERE
A LITTLE OFF,

01:10.170 --> 01:13.441
SO I RAN A PERIPHERAL
BLOOD FLOW CYTOMETRY...

01:13.474 --> 01:15.176
WHICH CONFIRMED IT.

01:18.111 --> 01:19.412
YOU HAVE RELAPSED.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.784
GUESS I'M NOT GETTING OFF
EASY HERE, HUH?

01:26.287 --> 01:28.087
CHEMO'S NOT GONNA CURE ME.

01:28.121 --> 01:29.289
NOT ALONE.

01:30.724 --> 01:33.793
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE
A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT.

01:33.828 --> 01:35.528
THANK GOD WE HAVE...

01:35.563 --> 01:37.430
NATALIE WAITING
IN THE WINGS TO BE
YOUR DONOR.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.098
( flatly )
YEAH, THANK GOD.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.567
( sighs )

01:40.600 --> 01:43.236
SO HOW SOON
ARE WE GONNA HAVE
TO DO THE TRANSPLANT?

01:43.270 --> 01:45.171
THE NEXT HURDLE IS TO GET RID
OF THE CANCER CELLS.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.774
AGAIN.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.442
SINCE IT'S RETURNED,

01:48.475 --> 01:51.412
WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF ME
GOING INTO SECOND REMISSION?

01:51.444 --> 01:53.246
LET'S NOT FOCUS
ON THE ODDS.

01:54.414 --> 01:56.283
SO IT'LL BE ANOTHER MONTH
IN THE HOSPITAL.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.786
YEAH. APRIL,
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE A MOMENT

01:58.819 --> 02:00.353
AND LET YOURSELF
REACT TO THIS?

02:00.387 --> 02:02.890
I REACTED PLENTY LAST TIME
AND LOOK WHERE THAT GOT ME.

02:06.426 --> 02:09.896
I GUESS I'LL JUST NEED
SOME TIME TO WRAP THINGS UP,

02:10.129 --> 02:11.764
TELL THE "POST"...

02:13.501 --> 02:15.536
AND START CHEMO NEXT WEEK.

02:15.568 --> 02:17.704
I NEED YOU TO START
FIRST THING TOMORROW.

02:17.737 --> 02:19.139
TOMORROW?

02:19.173 --> 02:21.375
I CAN'T JUST DROP OUT
OF MY LIFE THAT FAST.

02:21.408 --> 02:24.277
I-- I MEAN, GIVE ME
A COUPLE OFF DAYS AT LEAST.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.447
I-- I--

02:26.479 --> 02:29.182
LAST TIME WITH GEORGE,
I DIDN'T EVEN START
FOR A FEW WEEKS.

02:29.216 --> 02:30.450
THIS ISN'T
LIKE LAST TIME.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.286
SINCE YOUR CANCER
HAS RETURNED

02:32.319 --> 02:34.622
THIS AGGRESSIVELY
AND THIS QUICKLY,

02:34.655 --> 02:36.223
IT'S MUCH MORE SERIOUS.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.224
IT'S STILL
THE SAME CANCER AS BEFORE.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.659
HOW MUCH MORE SERIOUS
CAN IT BE?

02:39.692 --> 02:41.829
APRIL, I HATE
TO PUT IT IN THESE TERMS...

02:43.930 --> 02:45.832
BUT WITHOUT
IMMEDIATE TREATMENT,

02:45.865 --> 02:48.269
YOU ONLY HAVE
TWO TO SIX WEEKS TO LIVE.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.486
( bell tolling )

03:17.330 --> 03:20.568
- ( chatting )
- Man: I TOLD YOU
WE WEREN'T GONNA BE READY

03:20.600 --> 03:22.635
FOR THE FOUNDATION
BEFORE THEN.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.938
I AIN'T PAYING MONEY
FOR YOUR STUPIDITY!

03:24.972 --> 03:27.274
HEY, PUT YOUR
BOSS ON THE
PHONE RIGHT NOW.

03:37.585 --> 03:38.918
UH, LEO?

03:39.954 --> 03:41.521
( piano music playing )

03:41.555 --> 03:44.290
( people chattering )

03:46.759 --> 03:50.229
- SARA.
- ( laughs ) SURPRISE.

03:50.264 --> 03:51.497
MY GOD. I--

03:51.531 --> 03:52.932
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.468
WHAT THE-- OH, OKAY.

03:54.501 --> 03:56.704
- WOW. HI.
- HI. I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

03:56.736 --> 03:57.937
IT WAS
A QUICK FLIGHT OVER--

03:57.972 --> 04:00.007
QUICKER THAN ALL
THE WAY TO SAN FRANCISCO.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.975
IT'S BEEN A FEW MONTHS
SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU,

04:02.008 --> 04:03.943
WHICH I FEEL BAD ABOUT.

04:03.978 --> 04:05.278
IT GOES BOTH WAYS.

04:05.312 --> 04:06.280
I SHOULD'VE REACHED OUT MORE,

04:06.312 --> 04:08.314
BUT MY NEW JOB

04:08.348 --> 04:09.782
JUST KEEPS ME SO BUSY.

04:09.817 --> 04:10.818
OH, I'M SURE.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.519
I'VE BEEN BUSY AS WELL.

04:12.552 --> 04:14.021
WE BOTH HAVE, YOU KNOW.

04:14.253 --> 04:16.322
DOING NEW THINGS.

04:18.257 --> 04:20.293
- HELLO.
- HELLO.

04:20.326 --> 04:21.629
HEY, MAE. THIS IS SARA,

04:21.661 --> 04:22.795
MY SISTER-IN-LAW.

04:22.829 --> 04:24.932
SHE'S VISITING FROM BOSTON.

04:24.964 --> 04:27.000
OH. WELL,
HELLO AND WELCOME

04:27.033 --> 04:28.901
TO THE EVER-EXOTIC CLEVELAND.

04:28.935 --> 04:29.937
( both laugh )

04:29.970 --> 04:32.372
SO ARE YOU HERE
TO SUPPORT THIS GUY?

04:32.406 --> 04:34.707
I AM, YEAH.
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE HERE?

04:34.742 --> 04:36.409
I'M ACTUALLY PART
OF THE CONFERENCE.

04:36.442 --> 04:39.379
I RUN A PEDIATRIC
CANCER RESEARCH CLINIC.

04:39.413 --> 04:42.449
OH. SO YOU'RE COLLEAGUES?

04:42.483 --> 04:44.418
- YEAH.
- SURE.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.451
( chuckling )

04:45.485 --> 04:47.353
( cellphone ringing )

04:47.387 --> 04:50.691
IT'S APRIL.
I'D BETTER TAKE THIS.

04:50.723 --> 04:52.860
HEY, HONEY, WHAT'S UP?

05:00.834 --> 05:02.603
( sighs )

05:02.636 --> 05:04.038
Emma:
SON OF A BITCH.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.906
GOD, HOW ARE YOU
SO CALM ABOUT THIS?

05:06.939 --> 05:08.675
THERE'S JUST SO MANY
OTHER PEOPLE

05:08.709 --> 05:11.011
WHO DESERVE THIS DAMN
DISEASE MORE THAN YOU.

05:11.045 --> 05:12.713
PEARL, FOR ONE.

05:12.745 --> 05:14.081
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO YOUR MOM?

05:14.314 --> 05:16.516
SHE'S GONNA
TRY AND MAKE
IT HOME,

05:16.550 --> 05:18.052
HOPEFULLY
BEFORE I GO
IN TOMORROW.

05:18.084 --> 05:21.055
TOMORROW?
SON OF A BITCH.

05:22.088 --> 05:23.557
SORRY.

05:23.589 --> 05:25.492
BUT SINCE MOM'S
GONE, GRANDMA,

05:25.526 --> 05:27.026
I COULD REALLY
USE YOUR HELP
GETTING PACKED.

05:27.060 --> 05:29.062
DO YOU WANT ME TO CALL
GRANNY AND GRANDPA CARVER?

05:29.096 --> 05:30.096
I ALREADY DID.

05:30.329 --> 05:32.066
WELL, WHAT CAN
I DO TO HELP?

05:32.098 --> 05:33.100
I CAN SKIP SCHOOL.

05:33.332 --> 05:35.401
April and Emma:
NO, YOU CAN'T.

05:35.435 --> 05:39.372
BUT, BRENNA, MAYBE YOU CAN
RESCHEDULE YOUR APPOINTMENT
WITH DR. HAMBURG.

05:39.406 --> 05:40.774
NO SKIPPING ANYTHING.

05:40.807 --> 05:43.110
BEING A BONE MARROW DONOR
IS SO IMPORTANT.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.846
I DON'T WANT YOU
SLOWING DOWN THE PROCESS
BY MISSING APPOINTMENTS.

05:47.346 --> 05:49.348
GRANDMA, IF YOU NEED
TO HELP APRIL,

05:49.382 --> 05:51.752
I COULD GET NATALIE
TO GO WITH ME.

05:51.784 --> 05:53.454
Emma: GOOD IDEA.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.954
BRENN, YOU'RE
ALREADY LATE
FOR SCHOOL.

05:54.987 --> 05:56.355
YOU SHOULD REALLY GO.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.661
I'M SO SORRY, APRIL.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.463
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

06:09.502 --> 06:11.105
( kisses )
I'LL START SOME LAUNDRY.

06:14.141 --> 06:16.476
YOU KNOW, I'VE
BEEN HERE BEFORE

06:16.509 --> 06:17.711
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.747
( sighs )
I JUST...

06:23.050 --> 06:25.052
I'M LATE FOR WORK.

06:25.084 --> 06:27.153
AND I STILL HAVE
TO TELL BETH...

06:27.387 --> 06:28.555
AND THE "POST."

06:28.588 --> 06:30.891
ARE YOU GONNA WORK ALL DAY?

06:30.923 --> 06:33.593
IT DEPENDS,
BUT I WAS WONDERING

06:33.627 --> 06:36.062
ABOUT ONE OTHER THING.

06:36.096 --> 06:39.466
MAYBE WE COULD SPEND
SOME TIME TOGETHER...

06:39.500 --> 06:40.867
LATER AT YOUR PLACE...

06:41.869 --> 06:43.137
ALONE.

06:44.504 --> 06:47.707
ONCE I START CHEMO,
THERE'LL BE CERTAIN THINGS

06:47.740 --> 06:50.110
THAT WE CAN'T DO ANYMORE,

06:50.144 --> 06:51.644
PROBABLY FOR A FEW MONTHS.

06:51.677 --> 06:53.913
- LIKE SAY THE WORD "SEX."
- ( sighs )

06:53.947 --> 06:57.084
( chuckles )
I THINK I CAN FIT IT IN...

06:58.418 --> 07:00.887
- TO MY SCHEDULE.
- ( chuckles )

07:05.692 --> 07:07.427
WELL, IT'S ONLY CANCER.

07:07.461 --> 07:10.463
RIGHT? I KNOW.
I FEEL LIKE A WUSS
EVEN COMPLAINING ABOUT IT.

07:10.497 --> 07:13.834
- I FORGIVE YOU.
- DO YOU FORGIVE ME
FOR HAVING TO POSTPONE

07:13.867 --> 07:17.137
- OUR BERMUDA WEEKEND?
- WE CAN JUST GO WHEN
YOU GET OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.505
WHO KNOWS WHEN THAT'LL BE.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.776
SO, ALONG WITH OUR TRIP,
I'LL ALSO BE MISSING

07:22.810 --> 07:25.512
EVERYTHING AT WORK,
THANKSGIVING,

07:25.545 --> 07:28.649
OUR FAMILIES ANNUAL
DRIVE TO AMHERST TO SEE
THE LEAVES CHANGE...

07:31.851 --> 07:33.220
BRENNA'S 17th BIRTHDAY.

07:35.689 --> 07:38.524
WELL, LEAVES ARE
STUPID ANYWAY.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.098
- WHAT?
- I JUST HAD THIS...

07:46.132 --> 07:48.067
DUMB THOUGHT THAT...

07:49.603 --> 07:51.471
I MIGHT NEVER HAVE
MY OWN WEDDING.

07:51.504 --> 07:54.473
APRIL, YOU--
YOU CAN'T THINK LIKE THAT.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.244
I KNOW.
I DON'T, REALLY.

07:57.476 --> 08:00.247
I JUST... HAVE THESE
CRAZY THOUGHTS SOMETIMES.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.983
YEAH, YOU COULD BE
A MONTH OF CHEMO

08:03.016 --> 08:04.651
AND A BONE MARROW
TRANSPLANT AWAY

08:04.685 --> 08:06.954
FROM PUTTING ALL OF THIS
BEHIND YOU FOR GOOD.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.057
- YOU'RE TOTALLY RIGHT.
- DAMN RIGHT I'M RIGHT.

08:10.089 --> 08:13.492
AND IN THE MEANTIME,
WHO SAYS YOU HAVE TO
MISS OUT ON ANYTHING?

08:13.526 --> 08:15.528
YOU STILL HAVE
THE ENTIRE DAY AHEAD OF YOU.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.598
ALL YOU NEED
FOR THANKSGIVING
IS A TURKEY,

08:17.630 --> 08:20.233
AND YOU CAN STILL CELEBRATE
BRENNA'S BIRTHDAY TODAY.

08:20.266 --> 08:22.134
IT'LL JUST BE
A LITTLE EARLY.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.838
WELL, WE CAN'T GO
TO BERMUDA AND BACK IN A DAY.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.074
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU JUST LET ME
WORRY ABOUT THAT, OKAY?

08:27.106 --> 08:29.242
AND YOU GO AND GET
YOURSELF OUT OF WORK.

08:31.245 --> 08:32.578
- OKAY.
- MM-HMM.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.081
LOVE YOU.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.552
( sighs )

08:45.859 --> 08:47.860
( people chattering )

08:50.197 --> 08:52.298
( shouting )
ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!

08:52.532 --> 08:54.268
I HAVE GIVEN THIS NEWSPAPER

08:54.301 --> 08:56.135
THE BEST YEARS OF MY LIFE

08:56.168 --> 08:58.105
WITH MY COLUMN
"WHAT THE HECK,"

08:58.138 --> 09:02.009
AND YOU REPAY ME
BY LAYING ME OFF?!

09:04.144 --> 09:07.147
WHAT THE HELL?!
( chuckles )

09:07.179 --> 09:09.750
I'M GOING FULL
"JERRY MAGUIRE" HERE!

09:09.783 --> 09:11.317
I AM STARTING
MY OWN NEWSPAPER

09:11.551 --> 09:15.288
FOUNDED ON INTEGRITY
AND NICENESS!

09:15.322 --> 09:16.923
WHO'S WITH ME?

09:16.956 --> 09:20.159
- ( phones ringing )
- ( murmuring )

09:26.099 --> 09:28.034
( mouths )

09:28.067 --> 09:31.772
- PAUL.
- THIS CRAPPY PAPER
IS FLOUNDERING

09:31.804 --> 09:34.040
AND THEY'RE CLEANING HOUSE
WITH LAYOFFS.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.876
IT'S BLACK TUESDAY.
NOBODY'S SAFE.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.663
GROWING UP, I WANTED
TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER,

09:56.697 --> 09:58.698
BUT NO, MY PARENTS SAID,
"YOU'VE GOTTA BE PRACTICAL.

09:58.731 --> 10:01.600
GO TO JOURNALISM SCHOOL."
IDIOTS.

10:01.634 --> 10:05.938
I JUST STARTED PRICING
VAGINAL REJUVENATION COSTS.

10:05.972 --> 10:08.240
THIS IS SERIOUSLY
THE WORST TIME FOR MONEY
TO BE TIGHT.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.309
- ( coughs )
- April: WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

10:10.344 --> 10:13.379
OUT ON ASSIGNMENT.
THE NEWS DOESN'T ALWAYS
FIND US AT OUR DESKS, APRIL.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.916
- SOMETIMES WE HAVE
TO LEAVE THE O--
- DANNY, SHUT UP.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.384
- SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING.
- MASSIVE LAYOFFS.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.787
Mallory:
THEY'RE WORKING THEIR WAY
THROUGH THE LIFESTYLE SECTION.

10:20.821 --> 10:23.356
PAUL PETERS
AND MATT THE TRAVEL GUY
ARE ALREADY GONE.

10:23.389 --> 10:25.125
DOMINIC'S IN THERE NOW.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.293
WHO'S THE GUY
IN THE MEETINGS?

10:27.326 --> 10:31.197
BOB REASER.
HE'S THIS INFAMOUS
MEDIA-EFFICIENCY EXPERT.

10:31.230 --> 10:34.868
H.R. HIRED HIM
TO COME IN HERE
AND MAKE UNBIASED CUTS.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.770
THEY CALL HIM
THE "GRIM REASER."

10:39.105 --> 10:41.975
- SO?
- I'M SAFE.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.643
WHAT WAS
IT LIKE IN THERE?

10:43.677 --> 10:45.245
DID THEY ASK ABOUT
TIME OFF OR ANYTHING?

10:45.278 --> 10:47.713
THEY MOSTLY ASKED ME
WHAT I'D DONE WHILE
I'D BEEN HERE,

10:47.748 --> 10:50.716
AND THEN THEY CALLED ME
BACK IN LATER TO TELL ME
THAT THEY'RE KEEPING ME ON.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.019
- DID THEY EXPLAIN WHY?
- THE IMPRESSION I GOT

10:53.052 --> 10:55.422
IS THAT THEY'RE
LOOKING TO CUT BACK
ON THE SPECIALTY COLUMNS,

10:55.654 --> 10:57.790
BUT IT ALSO LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE PICKING OFF

10:57.823 --> 10:59.692
THE LOW MEN
ON THE TOTEM POLE.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.897
( sighs )

11:03.929 --> 11:05.065
IT'S GONNA BE ME.

11:05.097 --> 11:07.134
YOU'VE BEEN A STAFFER HERE
LONGER THAN I HAVE.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.101
I KNOW THEY'RE GONNA
GET RID OF ME.

11:09.135 --> 11:11.904
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
- PHEW!

11:13.340 --> 11:15.307
( Sara sighs )
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

11:15.341 --> 11:17.344
I'M A THOUSAND MILES AWAY
FROM APRIL

11:17.376 --> 11:19.346
WHILE SHE'S DEALING
WITH HER RELAPSE.
I'M SO STUPID.

11:19.379 --> 11:20.980
YEAH, BUT THERE'S
NO WAY YOU COULD'VE KNOWN.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.315
- NO, I NEVER SHOULD'VE LEFT.
- ( beeping )

11:22.349 --> 11:24.183
SHE MUST BE
TERRIFIED RIGHT NOW.

11:24.216 --> 11:26.019
SHE'S IN THE BEST CARE
WITH SUSAN.

11:26.052 --> 11:27.921
AND I-- I CAN'T--
LOOK AT THIS.

11:27.953 --> 11:30.456
THIS AIRLINE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE
A FLIGHT TO BOSTON TODAY.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.259
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

11:32.292 --> 11:35.028
THERE'S ONE
TOMORROW WITH--

11:35.062 --> 11:37.697
I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD
OF SANDPIPER AIRLINES.

11:37.730 --> 11:38.899
I-- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING!

11:38.932 --> 11:40.167
ALL RIGHT, COME WITH ME.
COME HERE. COME ON.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.467
- WHERE?
- COME ON. JUST COME ON.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.870
- GEORGE, GEORGE, GEORGE.
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

11:43.903 --> 11:46.306
SORRY.
EXCUSE US. SORRY.

11:46.338 --> 11:48.707
- EXCUSE US.
I'M SORRY.
- GEORGE.

11:48.741 --> 11:51.043
IT'S ALL RIGHT. HI.
SORRY, EXCUSE ME. SORRY.

11:51.077 --> 11:53.346
WE HAVE TO GET TO BOSTON
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,

11:53.379 --> 11:55.381
BUT YOUR MACHINES AREN'T
BEING VERY HELPFUL.

11:55.414 --> 11:57.716
UM, I'M A TRIPLE-BONUS
PLATINUM FLIER,

11:57.750 --> 11:59.219
SO YOU NEED TO WAIT
IN THE BACK OF THE LINE.

11:59.251 --> 12:01.488
NO, I DON'T.
HER DAUGHTER'S STARTING
CHEMOTHERAPY IN THE MORNING,

12:01.721 --> 12:03.322
WHICH I THINK
PRETTY MUCH TRUMPS

12:03.355 --> 12:05.392
WHATEVER TROPICAL LOCATION
YOU'RE GOING TO.

12:05.424 --> 12:07.360
OH, PLEASE, GO AHEAD.

12:07.394 --> 12:10.062
- IT'S-- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- ( keyboard clicking )

12:10.096 --> 12:11.730
( woman speaking on P.A. )

12:11.764 --> 12:13.899
- ( beeps )
- I'M SORRY, BUT THERE
ARE NO DIRECT FLIGHTS

12:13.933 --> 12:15.469
TO BOSTON LEAVING OUT
OF THIS AIRPORT TODAY.

12:15.501 --> 12:18.105
WHAT'S THE EARLIEST
YOU COULD GET ME THERE?

12:18.138 --> 12:19.371
- ( keyboard clicking )
- ( beeps )

12:19.405 --> 12:20.474
THERE'S A FLIGHT
THROUGH CHARLOTTE,

12:20.506 --> 12:22.142
ARRIVING AT LOGAN
AROUND MIDNIGHT.

12:22.174 --> 12:23.943
- MIDNIGHT?
- I KNOW.

12:23.976 --> 12:25.511
I GUESS I'LL TAKE IT.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.014
ACTUALLY,
MAKE THAT TWO TICKETS.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.317
- I'M GOING WITH YOU.
- ( keyboard clicking )

12:33.253 --> 12:34.788
( credit card flicks )

12:34.821 --> 12:37.057
Man:
WE THOUGHT WE'D
PRETTY MUCH EXHAUSTED

12:37.090 --> 12:39.192
THE NATIONAL REGISTRY
OVER THESE LAST THREE YEARS

12:39.225 --> 12:41.861
SEARCHING FOR A DONOR
TO MATCH YOUR TYPE
OF BONE MARROW.

12:41.894 --> 12:43.462
- Boys: GIVE IT! GIVE IT!
- BUT I HAVE GOOD NEWS.

12:43.496 --> 12:46.866
- BOYS!
- THAT FART-SUCKER
STARTED IT!

12:46.899 --> 12:49.536
Man #2:
AND I'M GONNA FINISH IT
IF YOU TWO DON'T KNOCK IT OFF.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.272
- SORRY.
- SORRY.

12:52.304 --> 12:54.474
- WHAT'S THE NEWS?
- WE HAVE A MATCH.

12:54.508 --> 12:57.177
- FINALLY.
- HOW SURE ARE YOU?

12:57.210 --> 12:58.979
WELL, AT THIS POINT,
IT'S A MATCH,

12:59.011 --> 13:01.780
BUT WE STILL NEED
TO TEST THE DONOR
TO SEE HOW VIABLE THEY ARE.

13:01.815 --> 13:04.116
- Man #2: WELL, IS IT
A MATCH OR NOT?
- DAD.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.820
RIGHT NOW...
IT'S OUR BEST CHANCE.

13:06.852 --> 13:09.556
WELL, THAT'S AWESOME,
AND IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

13:10.856 --> 13:12.259
WELL, SINCE WE HAVE
A POTENTIAL MATCH,

13:12.292 --> 13:13.826
YOU'LL NEED TO MEET
WITH ALL THE MEMBERS

13:13.860 --> 13:16.163
OF OUR TRANSPLANT TEAM
AS WE START TO MOVE FORWARD.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.565
THAT'S OUR TEAM PSYCHOLOGIST,
THE SOCIAL WORKER

13:18.798 --> 13:20.466
AND THE FINANCIAL
COORDINATOR.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.536
WELL, HOW--
HOW MUCH IS THE TRANSPLANT?

13:22.568 --> 13:25.238
ANYWHERE FROM $100,000
TO $200,000.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.807
OUR-- OUR INSURANCE
COVERS ALL THAT, RIGHT?

13:29.109 --> 13:31.311
YOU FOCUS ON YOUR NEXT
COUPLE OF ROUNDS OF CHEMO

13:31.344 --> 13:33.279
TO GET YOU READY
FOR YOUR TRANSPLANT.
OKAY, FINN?

13:33.312 --> 13:36.950
SO... WHO'S THIS DONOR?

13:36.982 --> 13:39.985
WELL, DONORS
ON THE NATIONAL REGISTRY
MUST REMAIN ANONYMOUS.

13:40.019 --> 13:42.087
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE
IN THE COUNTRY THEY ARE.

13:42.121 --> 13:44.224
BUT WHOEVER IT IS,
I'M SURE THEY KNOW

13:44.256 --> 13:46.559
THAT THEY'RE DOING
SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY.

13:49.863 --> 13:52.298
Brenna:
HOSPITALS TOTALLY
CREEP ME OUT.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.934
I DON'T KNOW
HOW APRIL DOES THIS.

13:56.101 --> 13:57.604
IS SHE OKAY?

13:58.605 --> 14:01.041
YEAH, I--
I THINK SHE'S GOOD.

14:01.073 --> 14:03.176
- ( sighs )
- WHAT'S WRONG?

14:04.543 --> 14:08.447
IT'S JUST... SHE AND I HAD
THIS FIGHT THE OTHER NIGHT.

14:08.480 --> 14:12.052
- ABOUT WHAT?
- KIND OF A LONG STORY.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.852
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I SHOULD DO, THOUGH.

14:13.886 --> 14:17.190
SHOULD I CALL HER?
I DON'T WANNA MAKE
ANYTHING WORSE.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.458
APRIL AND I FIGHT
ALL THE TIME.

14:19.491 --> 14:21.193
- IT'S WHAT SISTERS DO.
- ( door opens )

14:21.227 --> 14:24.364
HEY, LADIES.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.600
HOW'S APRIL HOLDING UP?

14:26.633 --> 14:28.368
YOU KNOW HOW SHE IS.

14:28.400 --> 14:29.903
ALWAYS WORRIED
ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE.

14:29.936 --> 14:31.605
( chuckles )
HOW ABOUT YOU?

14:31.638 --> 14:32.871
YOU OKAY TO DO
THE TEST TODAY,

14:32.905 --> 14:34.540
OR SHOULD WE PUT IT OFF
TILL TOMORROW?

14:34.573 --> 14:37.143
- I DON'T WANNA WAIT.
- OKAY.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.546
WELL, THEN LET'S GO
THROUGH THIS QUESTIONNAIRE
TOGETHER, OKAY?

14:39.578 --> 14:43.082
ANY RECENT FLUS, COLDS
OR UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS?

14:43.115 --> 14:47.220
- NO.
- ANY HOSPITALIZATION
AND/OR SURGICAL PROCEDURES

14:47.254 --> 14:50.090
FOR ANY REASON
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS?

14:50.123 --> 14:53.058
I MEAN, YOU'D PROBABLY
REMEMBER SOMETHING THAT WAS
IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO MENTION.

14:53.092 --> 14:55.495
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
GETTING YOUR WISDOM TEETH
OUT OR ANYTHING.

14:55.528 --> 14:58.130
( chuckles ) YEAH.
UH, NO.

14:58.163 --> 14:59.265
UM...

15:01.368 --> 15:05.639
IT'S JUST THAT
ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO I...

15:05.672 --> 15:10.543
HAD AN ABORTION,
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT COUNTS.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.677
NOT AT ALL.

15:13.178 --> 15:14.648
NO JUDGMENT.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.921
REGARDLESS,
YOU'RE GONNA FIND SOMETHING.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.990
YOU ARE SO TALENTED.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.924
THANK YOU, APRIL.

15:25.958 --> 15:29.361
I GUESS THIS WILL
GIVE ME MORE TIME
TO SPEND WITH MY KIDS.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.563
OH GOD.

15:37.236 --> 15:38.937
( sighs )

15:42.174 --> 15:43.942
MALLORY'S OUT, TOO.

15:43.976 --> 15:47.047
THEY'RE STARTING
THE SCREENING PROCESS
WITH US IN METRO NEXT.

15:49.316 --> 15:53.452
HEY. I HEARD YOUR
CONVERSATION WITH NATALIE

15:53.485 --> 15:55.522
- DIDN'T GO ALL THAT WELL.
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT
THAT RIGHT NOW.

15:55.554 --> 15:57.456
WHAT'S WRONG?

15:59.292 --> 16:02.595
I HAVEN'T TOLD
ANYONE HERE YET,
BUT I RELAPSED...

16:02.629 --> 16:04.630
FOR REAL THIS TIME.

16:04.663 --> 16:07.100
I FOUND OUT
THIS MORNING, AND...

16:07.133 --> 16:08.735
I HAVE TO
START CHEMO TOMORROW.

16:08.967 --> 16:10.669
GOD, APRIL.

16:13.639 --> 16:14.673
I'M SO SORRY.

16:20.346 --> 16:22.282
WHAT ARE
YOU STILL DOING HERE?

16:22.315 --> 16:26.086
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE MY JOB
AND I CAN'T JUST POP
INTO RAQUEL'S OFFICE

16:26.119 --> 16:28.221
AND ASK OFF
FOR ANOTHER MONTH OF CHEMO.

16:28.254 --> 16:29.688
WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENING?

16:29.722 --> 16:33.158
AND SHE CALLED ME OUT
YESTERDAY FOR SLACKING OFF.

16:33.192 --> 16:36.196
THEY CAN'T LAY YOU OFF
BECAUSE YOU'RE SICK, RIGHT?

16:36.229 --> 16:38.063
THAT'S A CHANCE
I'M NOT WILLING TO TAKE.

16:38.097 --> 16:40.633
WITH EVERYTHING
THAT I'M GONNA LOSE
AFTER TODAY--

16:40.667 --> 16:43.370
MORE TIME OF MY LIFE,
MORE OF MY HEALTH--

16:43.403 --> 16:45.437
I AM NOT LOSING THIS JOB.

16:49.576 --> 16:51.211
( sighs )

16:57.216 --> 16:58.717
- ( man speaking on P.A. )
- George: HERE YOU GO.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.720
- Sara: OH, THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

17:00.754 --> 17:02.721
WHAT TIME ARE THEY GONNA
START BOARDING?

17:02.755 --> 17:05.424
- ANY MINUTE, I GUESS.
- ( sighs )

17:05.458 --> 17:08.027
GOD, I HATE
NOT BEING THERE
FOR HER RIGHT NOW.

17:09.128 --> 17:11.163
I MEAN, SHE SOUNDS LIKE
SHE'S DEALING WITH IT OKAY--

17:11.196 --> 17:13.599
I JUST WISH
I COULD SEE HER FACE.
I'D KNOW WHAT SHE'S FEELING.

17:13.633 --> 17:14.768
WELL, YEAH,
WITH THE RELAPSE,

17:14.800 --> 17:17.770
IT'S HARD NOT TO FEEL
SHOCK, FEAR, ANGER.

17:17.804 --> 17:21.708
OH NO, GEORGE.
YOU DIDN'T GET
TO GIVE YOUR SPEECH.

17:21.740 --> 17:25.044
- I'M SO SORRY.
- IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN HOW
I PLANNED TO SPEND THE DAY,

17:25.077 --> 17:26.378
BUT I WOULDN'T HAVE IT
ANY OTHER WAY.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.781
YOU KNOW, I-- I'D DO
ANYTHING FOR THOSE GIRLS.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.518
IT'S HARDER THAN I THOUGHT
NOT BEING AROUND 'EM.

17:32.684 --> 17:34.421
( sighs )
I'M MISSING EVERYBODY.

17:34.453 --> 17:36.756
Woman on P.A.:
This is the final
boarding call for--

17:36.789 --> 17:38.223
SO HOW'S EMMA DOING?

17:38.258 --> 17:39.726
( chuckles )
SHE'S DATING.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.060
- ( both laugh )
- GO, EMMA.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.663
WOW.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.299
HOW ABOUT YOU?
YOU SEEING ANYBODY?

17:47.333 --> 17:51.304
NOT EXACTLY, NO.
I WAS SORT OF SEEING SOMEONE--

17:51.336 --> 17:53.472
AN IMMIGRATION LAWYER
IN MY BUILDING.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.074
- YEAH? IT DIDN'T WORK OUT?
- NO.

17:55.107 --> 17:57.143
I'M NOT SURE HIS MARRIAGE
IS GONNA WORK OUT EITHER.

17:57.176 --> 18:00.413
- ( scoffs )
- YEAH, SOMETHING
HE NEGLECTED TO TELL ME.

18:00.446 --> 18:02.615
AND WASN'T THE GUY YOU MET
ONLINE MARRIED, TOO?

18:02.648 --> 18:04.517
( annoyed )
THANK YOU, YES.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.654
HOW ABOUT YOU?

18:08.688 --> 18:10.088
UH, NO, I'M NOT MARRIED.

18:10.123 --> 18:13.425
- ARE YOU SEEING ANYONE?
- NO, NOT-- NOT REALLY.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.228
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE,
YOU CAN TELL ME.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.630
- I'M TOTALLY FINE WITH IT.
- YOU KNOW, DON'T YOU?

18:17.663 --> 18:20.365
- THAT YOU'RE DATING MAE?
- I MEAN, HOW DID YOU--

18:20.400 --> 18:22.501
I'M JUST THAT GOOD.

18:22.535 --> 18:25.204
IT'S NEW,
BUT IT'S ALSO OLD.

18:25.238 --> 18:28.240
WE MET YEARS AGO
WHEN I WAS IN DOCTORS
WITHOUT BORDERS.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.742
AND YOU RAN INTO EACH OTHER
AGAIN IN SAN FRANCISCO?

18:30.777 --> 18:33.212
YEAH. SHE DOESN'T LIVE THERE,
BUT SHE WAS VISITING FRIENDS.

18:33.246 --> 18:37.182
AND HER CLINIC'S IN PORTLAND,
SO... HAVE A LITTLE COMMUTING.

18:38.384 --> 18:40.286
FOR TWO PEOPLE WHO WANTED
SOMETHING EASIER,

18:40.319 --> 18:42.888
WE SURE LANDED
INTO SOME COMPLICATED
RELATIONSHIPS.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.790
- I CANNOT ARGUE WITH THAT.
- Man on P.A.: We will now begin

18:44.824 --> 18:47.559
pre-boarding of passengers
for flight 323 to Charlotte.

18:47.594 --> 18:48.595
OH YAY.

18:50.395 --> 18:53.132
- HEY, YOU DOING OKAY?
- UH, YUP,

18:53.165 --> 18:56.769
BUT I THINK I MIGHT'VE HAD
A LITTLE TOO MUCH CHEMO TODAY.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.738
WELL, I'M CUTTING YOU OFF
IN A FEW HOURS THEN.

18:58.770 --> 19:00.839
( chuckles )
DID YOUR FAMILY LEAVE?

19:00.874 --> 19:04.711
YEAH. SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER
WHEN THEY'RE NOT AROUND.

19:04.743 --> 19:07.846
YUP. I FEEL THE SAME WAY
ABOUT MY FAMILY.

19:07.881 --> 19:10.215
( both laugh )

19:10.250 --> 19:11.917
WOW. LOOK AT THAT KID GO.

19:12.151 --> 19:15.355
YEAH. THAT'S ME.

19:16.455 --> 19:18.790
WOW. MAN,
YOU WERE INCREDIBLE.

19:20.393 --> 19:21.661
YEAH, I WAS.

19:25.531 --> 19:27.733
( people chattering )

19:27.767 --> 19:30.670
IN A NUTSHELL,
THE PAPER'S IN
A DIRE SITUATION.

19:30.702 --> 19:33.338
AARON'S TENURE DID
MORE HARM THAN GOOD,

19:33.373 --> 19:36.875
WHICH HAS LED
TO SOME VERY DESPERATE
BUT NECESSARY MEASURES.

19:36.910 --> 19:39.945
NOW, APRIL,
YOU JOINED THE "POST"

19:40.179 --> 19:44.550
LAST FEBRUARY AS A FLOATER
AND WERE PROMOTED TO STAFFER
IN THE SPRING.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.786
- THAT'S CORRECT.
- APRIL ALSO WEATHERED

19:46.818 --> 19:48.688
THE MORE RECENT
MIRANDA SCANDAL.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.823
MMM, I SEE HERE
THAT YOU TOOK A--

19:50.856 --> 19:54.394
WOW-- FOUR-MONTH
MEDICAL LEAVE.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.828
IS THAT MY PERMANENT RECORD
OR SOMETHING? ( chuckles )

19:56.863 --> 19:59.898
YOU KNOW, I THINK
THAT WE COULD USE
SOME TIME TO REVIEW THIS.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.834
APRIL, WE'LL NEED TO MEET
WITH YOU AGAIN TOMORROW.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.903
I CAN REVIEW THAT RIGHT NOW
FOR YOU IF THAT HELPS.

20:04.938 --> 20:06.972
WE'RE TABLING
ALL EMPLOYEES

20:07.205 --> 20:09.208
WITH EXTENUATING
CIRCUMSTANCES

20:09.241 --> 20:10.943
AS WE'VE GOT A LOT
TO GET THROUGH TODAY.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.511
Raquel:
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.851
I CAN'T MEET
WITH YOU TOMORROW.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.921
THE REASON I WAS GONE
FOR FOUR MONTHS BEFORE

20:21.954 --> 20:23.890
IS BECAUSE I HAVE CANCER.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.857
AND THE FIRST TIME
I FOUND OUT,

20:25.892 --> 20:27.894
I WAS TRYING
TO CONTROL THE SITUATION,

20:27.926 --> 20:30.229
AND WELL, IT...
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE

20:30.262 --> 20:32.397
THAT'S HAPPENING THIS TIME,
BECAUSE IT'S BACK.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.602
I LOVE MY JOB,
I'M REALLY GOOD AT IT,

20:35.634 --> 20:37.002
AND I WANT TO KEEP IT,

20:37.236 --> 20:39.739
BUT I HAVE TO START
CHEMO TOMORROW.

20:39.771 --> 20:42.709
I COULD BE GONE
FOR ANOTHER MONTH,
MAYBE EVEN MORE,

20:42.741 --> 20:44.344
UNLESS YOU WANNA
LAY ME OFF NOW.

20:44.376 --> 20:45.979
THAT'S UP TO YOU.

20:46.011 --> 20:50.450
BUT I HAVE TO GO
AND PREPARE FOR TOMORROW.

20:50.482 --> 20:52.518
WE'LL DISCUSS
AND GET BACK TO YOU.

20:53.819 --> 20:54.820
THANK YOU.

21:04.663 --> 21:05.865
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU MADE THIS HAPPEN

21:05.897 --> 21:07.467
- IN A MATTER OF HOURS.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE

21:07.500 --> 21:09.501
YOU CONTINUE TO DOUBT
MY AWESOMENESS.

21:09.535 --> 21:10.803
( reggae music playing )

21:10.836 --> 21:13.006
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
BERMUDA, BUT--

21:13.038 --> 21:15.607
CLOSE ENOUGH, COMPARED
TO WHERE I'M GOING.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.746
ANY WORD FROM GRAHAM?

21:19.778 --> 21:22.848
UH, NOPE.
( sighs ) NOPE.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.916
I THOUGHT HE WOULD'VE
AT LEAST TEXTED ME,

21:24.951 --> 21:27.653
ESPECIALLY SINCE HE LEFT
HIS "TWIN PEAKS" DVDs
AT MY PLACE,

21:27.686 --> 21:30.390
WHICH I'VE BEEN USING
AS INDOOR FRISBEES.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.923
DOES THAT HELP
WITH THE ANGER?

21:31.958 --> 21:33.893
- NO NO, I'M NOT ANGRY.
- MMM.

21:35.028 --> 21:37.529
REALLY, I'M NOT.
I'M NOT!

21:37.563 --> 21:38.798
- OKAY.
- I'M NOT.
I'VE BEEN FINDING

21:38.830 --> 21:40.866
SO MUCH GRATIFICATION
IN MY JOB LATELY,

21:40.900 --> 21:42.669
DESPITE ALL
OF ITS CRAZINESS.

21:42.701 --> 21:46.673
I FEEL LIKE,
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE, I'M--

21:46.705 --> 21:49.509
I'M BUILDING
SOMETHING THAT'S MINE,

21:49.541 --> 21:51.411
AND I HAVE YOU
TO THANK FOR THAT.

21:52.577 --> 21:54.614
NOW YOU KNOW WHY
MY JOB IS SO IMPORTANT

21:54.646 --> 21:56.582
EVER SINCE I GOT SICK.

21:56.615 --> 21:59.085
( sighs )
THE THOUGHT
OF LOSING IT IS SO SCARY.

21:59.317 --> 22:01.788
APRIL CARVER,
YOU ARE NOT GONNA
LOSE YOUR JOB.

22:03.321 --> 22:04.824
NO OFFENSE
TO YOUR BOSS, BETH,

22:04.856 --> 22:08.493
BUT I HAD NO IDEA JACLYN
WAS SUCCESSFUL ENOUGH
TO OWN HER OWN BOAT.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.663
OH, THIS ISN'T
JACLYN'S BOAT.

22:10.696 --> 22:11.830
THEN WHO'S IS IT?

22:11.864 --> 22:14.467
HEY! WHAT ARE YOU GIRLS
DOING ON THAT BOAT?

22:14.500 --> 22:16.969
OH. OKAY,
LUNCHTIME'S OVER.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.771
- LUNCHTIME'S OVER.
- WHAT?! OH MY GOD.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.507
- Man: YEAH, LUNCHTIME IS OVER.
- Beth: LET'S GO.

22:21.540 --> 22:23.509
- April: WHAT?!
- Beth: YEAH, WOULD YOU
LIKE SOME COUSCOUS?

22:26.511 --> 22:28.614
YOU'RE JUST GONNA BE
IN THE HOSPITAL.

22:28.647 --> 22:30.682
WE CAN CELEBRATE
MY BIRTHDAY THEN.

22:30.717 --> 22:33.720
I KNOW, BUT IT WON'T
BE THE SAME.

22:33.752 --> 22:35.621
I CAN'T BE
OUTSIDE LIKE THIS,

22:35.654 --> 22:38.590
- SO MAKE A WISH.
- ( sighs )

22:46.833 --> 22:48.634
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT EVERYTHING?

22:48.667 --> 22:50.970
ARE YOU OKAY?

22:51.002 --> 22:55.407
AH, YOU KNOW ME,
IF I'M NOT LOIS LANE,
I'M SUPERGIRL, SO--

22:55.441 --> 22:57.777
WELL, I'M GONNA
COME AND VISIT YOU

22:57.809 --> 23:00.613
AS MUCH
AS I POSSIBLY CAN.

23:00.645 --> 23:02.448
I MEAN, IT'S GONNA BE
A LITTLE BIT HARDER

23:02.481 --> 23:05.817
BECAUSE OF SCHOOL
AND STUFF, BUT I'LL COME
EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL

23:05.852 --> 23:09.020
- AND ON THE WEEKENDS.
- VISIT WHENEVER YOU WANT TO,

23:09.055 --> 23:11.923
NOT BECAUSE YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU HAVE TO FOR ME.

23:11.958 --> 23:14.059
I'LL BE FINE.
YOU NEED TO GO BE

23:14.093 --> 23:16.828
A NORMAL SOON-TO-BE-
17-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

23:16.863 --> 23:19.965
NORMAL'S NEVER REALLY
BEEN MY THING.

23:22.468 --> 23:26.638
IT WAS... REALLY HARD
THE LAST TIME YOU WERE
IN THE HOSPITAL.

23:26.672 --> 23:29.608
AND... I NEVER
TOLD YOU THIS,

23:29.642 --> 23:33.645
BUT SOMETIMES
I WOULD JUST PASS
THROUGH YOUR ROOM

23:33.679 --> 23:35.080
AND START CRYING.

23:35.114 --> 23:39.519
I MEAN, I JUST--
I FELT LIKE AN ONLY CHILD
AND IT SUCKED.

23:39.551 --> 23:42.020
YOU SHOULD BE HOME WITH US.

23:43.055 --> 23:46.125
WELL... SINCE I CAN'T BE,

23:46.159 --> 23:48.493
I BOUGHT YOU THIS.

23:55.167 --> 23:57.936
- WHAT?!
- I'M NOT GONNA BE AROUND
FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

23:57.970 --> 23:59.739
SO I WAS HOPING MAYBE...

23:59.771 --> 24:02.074
YOU WOULD DOCUMENT
EVERYTHING I'M GONNA MISS.

24:02.107 --> 24:05.010
I WILL.
THANK YOU.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.711
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BRENN.

24:06.746 --> 24:09.582
- I LOVE YOU.
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.750
( cellphone rings )

24:13.051 --> 24:14.186
HEY, MOM, WHERE ARE YOU?

24:14.220 --> 24:16.454
- WE'RE IN CHARLOTTE.
- April: "We"?

24:16.489 --> 24:18.924
- YEAH, UNCLE GEORGE IS
COMING BACK WITH ME.
- ( excitedly ) Really?

24:18.958 --> 24:20.526
UNCLE GEORGE IS
COMING BACK WITH MOM.

24:20.559 --> 24:22.528
THAT'S GREAT.
( laughs )

24:22.561 --> 24:24.529
THE GIRLS ARE EXCITED
TO SEE YOU.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.464
HONEY, OUR FLIGHT
DOESN'T LEAVE FOR
A COUPLE OF HOURS,

24:26.499 --> 24:28.534
- SO IT'S GONNA BE LATE.
- ASK HER WHAT SUSAN
IS PLANNING.

24:28.567 --> 24:30.169
DO YOU NEED TO BE
AT THE HOSPITAL
BY 8:00 AGAIN?

24:30.202 --> 24:32.505
- Yes.
- RIGHT, AND SINCE
THE LAST CHEMO DIDN'T WORK,

24:32.538 --> 24:34.207
WILL THEY HAVE
A DIFFERENT COCKTAIL?

24:34.240 --> 24:36.741
- NOW WHAT ABOUT THE BLASTS?
- HEY, WHAT WAS THE PERCENTAGE
OF BLASTS?

24:36.776 --> 24:40.779
AND WILL THEY--
WILL THEY HAVE FLOW MARKERS
AS AT YOUR ORIGINAL DIAGNOSIS?

24:40.813 --> 24:42.248
OR IS THAT...

24:49.255 --> 24:51.257
Leo:
NO WORD FROM THE "POST"?

24:51.490 --> 24:52.825
I WAS CHECKING
THE TIME.

24:52.858 --> 24:54.259
AND YOUR VOICEMAIL.

24:56.494 --> 24:58.497
WHEN DID YOU GET
TO KNOW ME SO WELL?

24:59.498 --> 25:00.766
NO, NO WORD YET.

25:00.799 --> 25:02.934
I'M TRYING NOT TO THINK
ABOUT IT, THOUGH.

25:05.104 --> 25:07.973
SO...
( sighs )

25:08.007 --> 25:11.844
- SHOULD WE DO IT?
- I GUESS. YEAH.

25:13.546 --> 25:16.715
WOW. SCHEDULED SEX
IS, LIKE, THE LEAST
ROMANTIC THING EVER.

25:16.749 --> 25:20.720
I HEAR MIDDLE-AGED COUPLES
AND PASSIONLESS MARRIAGES
DO IT ALL THE TIME.

25:20.752 --> 25:23.122
ALL RIGHT.

25:23.154 --> 25:25.023
I'M REALLY
UNCOMFORTABLE NOW.

25:26.291 --> 25:29.295
WELL, LET'S SEE
IF WE CAN'T...

25:29.528 --> 25:30.730
GET COMFORTABLE.

FOR NAUSEA DURING CHEMO,

27:06.692 --> 27:09.327
BUT NOTHING TO MAINTAIN
SEX DRIVE. INTERESTING.

27:09.362 --> 27:12.365
- I'LL MENTION IT
TO DR. HAMBURG.
- ( chuckles )

27:13.632 --> 27:15.300
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS
FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT?

27:15.334 --> 27:17.336
THANKSGIVING DINNER
WITH MY FAMILY.

27:17.369 --> 27:19.137
OH, CAN I COME?

27:19.171 --> 27:21.307
OF COURSE.
I SHOULD WARN YOU, THOUGH,

27:21.339 --> 27:23.275
MY SISTER AND GRANDMA
ARE PREPARING IT,

27:23.308 --> 27:27.645
AND... ( chuckles )
THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY
THE CHEFS OF THE FAMILY.

27:28.913 --> 27:30.348
IT'S SWEET OF THEM
TO DO IT, THOUGH.

27:30.383 --> 27:34.386
I'M SURE IT'S HELPING THEM
DEAL WITH IT, YOU KNOW?

27:34.420 --> 27:36.055
IT'S REALLY HARD...

27:37.323 --> 27:39.825
KNOWING HOW MUCH PAIN THIS
IS PUTTING THEM THROUGH.

27:39.858 --> 27:41.426
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT ME.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.063
I'VE BEEN HEARING RUMORS
AT SUPPORT GROUP

27:44.096 --> 27:46.132
ABOUT THESE...

27:46.164 --> 27:47.866
SEX SUBSTITUTES.

27:47.900 --> 27:51.237
YOU KNOW, WOMEN WHO
FULFILL ALL THE NEEDS
OF THE CAREGIVERS.

27:54.205 --> 27:58.411
HEY, DO YOU MIND
IF I JUST MEET YOU
AT MY HOUSE IN AN HOUR?

27:58.443 --> 28:00.311
WAS IT
THE SURROGATE THING?
I'M-- I'M SORRY.

28:00.346 --> 28:03.449
- I'M NOT GONNA
USE 'EM THAT OFTEN.
- NO NO NO, UM...

28:03.682 --> 28:06.719
I JUST WANNA
DO SOMETHING FIRST.

28:06.751 --> 28:08.421
WELL, WHY CAN'T
WE JUST GO TOGETHER?

28:10.890 --> 28:12.391
I'LL BE FINE.

28:33.345 --> 28:35.247
( people chattering )

28:40.385 --> 28:42.855
- HEY.
- HI.

28:42.887 --> 28:46.724
UMM, I'M SO SORRY
FOR NOT CALLING
OR ANYTHING.

28:47.926 --> 28:49.427
BRENNA TOLD ME,
BUT I JUST--

28:49.461 --> 28:51.363
AFTER THE OTHER NIGHT,
I DIDN'T KNOW

28:51.396 --> 28:52.932
WHAT TO SAY.
I STILL DON'T.

28:52.964 --> 28:54.767
CONSIDERING THE DAY
I'M HAVING,

28:54.799 --> 28:58.069
YOU DATING MY EX-BOYFRIEND
IS THE LEAST OF MY WORRIES.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.372
( sighs )

29:00.405 --> 29:02.775
I'M NOT GONNA
KEEP YOU FROM DOING
WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY.

29:02.807 --> 29:05.443
SO YOU'RE OKAY WITH ME
AND DOMINIC DATING?

29:05.478 --> 29:06.945
I'M NOT GONNA
KEEP YOU FROM DOING IT.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.446
LET'S JUST
LEAVE IT AT THAT.

29:08.480 --> 29:12.451
- DO YOU STILL
WANT MY BONE MARROW?
- I'M GONNA NEED IT.

29:12.484 --> 29:15.453
- IT'S YOURS.
- I NEED SOMETHING ELSE.

29:16.955 --> 29:19.458
I DON'T KNOW HOW THINGS
ARE GONNA GO FOR ME.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.228
THIS RELAPSE IS...

29:23.229 --> 29:24.329
IT'S REALLY NOT GOOD,

29:24.363 --> 29:26.865
AND I WANT--

29:26.898 --> 29:30.135
JUST WATCH OUT
FOR BRENNA, OKAY?

29:30.169 --> 29:32.438
( crying )
TAKE CARE OF HER.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.807
BE THE--
( sighs )

29:34.839 --> 29:37.442
BE THE BIG SISTER THAT
I CAN'T BE FOR HER RIGHT NOW.

29:38.877 --> 29:40.211
I WILL.

29:41.913 --> 29:43.348
THANK YOU.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.923
Emma:
SON OF A BITCH.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.893
- YUM.
- I COULDN'T GET
A WHOLE ONE,

29:53.925 --> 29:55.994
AND NOW THESE
ARE ALL DRIED OUT.

29:56.028 --> 29:58.230
- Leo: MMM!
- April: IT'S FINE, GRANDMA.

29:58.263 --> 30:01.032
LOOKS LIKE
A TURKEY AUTOPSY.

30:01.066 --> 30:04.803
MOM TEXTED,
SHE AND GEORGE ARE
GONNA BE BOARDING SOON.

30:04.836 --> 30:06.905
OH, FINALLY,
SOME GOOD NEWS.

30:06.939 --> 30:09.541
- ( sizzling )
- GRANDMA, IS THAT
THE STUFFING?

30:09.575 --> 30:11.844
SON OF A BITCH.

30:11.876 --> 30:13.878
( April and Leo laugh )

30:15.079 --> 30:17.115
WELL, IS THERE--
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE

30:17.148 --> 30:20.152
THAT YOU NEED
BEFORE TOMORROW?

30:21.186 --> 30:22.488
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU?

30:24.589 --> 30:26.157
I'M SUFFOCATING YOU,
AREN'T I?

30:27.459 --> 30:30.863
I GUESS I'VE NEVER BEEN
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS.

30:30.895 --> 30:32.498
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THE ONE
GOING TO THE HOSPITAL,

30:32.530 --> 30:34.066
NOT THE ONE
BEING LEFT BEHIND.

30:34.098 --> 30:35.867
IT'S HARDER
THAN I THOUGHT.

30:35.901 --> 30:39.204
YOU'VE NEVER HAD
TO BE THE ONE THINKING
ABOUT LOSING SOMEONE.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.106
I'M NOT LOSING YOU.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.546
( woman speaks on P.A. )

30:47.579 --> 30:50.015
SARA, I REALLY
GOTTA SAY I'M-- I'M--

30:50.048 --> 30:52.351
I'M SO IMPRESSED.
( laughs )

30:52.384 --> 30:55.554
- WITH WHAT?
- WELL, JUST...

30:55.587 --> 30:57.323
THE WAY YOU HANDLED
APRIL EARLIER.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.357
YOU SEEM TO HAVE REALLY RISEN
TO THE OCCASION.

31:00.593 --> 31:02.094
WELL, IT'S NOT
MY FIRST RODEO.

31:02.126 --> 31:05.096
I HAD TO LEARN FAST.
I DON'T HAVE MUCH
OF A CHOICE.

31:05.130 --> 31:09.000
WELL, I JUST DIDN'T
THINK YOU'D HAVE TO DO
SO MUCH OF IT... ALONE.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.036
UH, YOU KNOW,
WHEN APRIL...

31:11.069 --> 31:13.905
ADMITTED TO YOU ALL
THAT SHE WAS SICK, THAT--

31:13.939 --> 31:16.375
I IMAGINED I'D
BE THE ONE WITH YOU
UNTIL SHE WAS CURED,

31:16.407 --> 31:18.076
NOT LIVING
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

31:18.109 --> 31:19.310
NO, YOU DID
WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.

31:19.345 --> 31:21.913
YEAH, I DID WHAT
I THOUGHT I SHOULD DO.

31:21.946 --> 31:23.949
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

31:23.982 --> 31:25.384
YOU HAVING REGRETS?

31:26.986 --> 31:29.355
IT'S NOT EASY SEEING
EVERYBODY MOVE ON WITHOUT ME.

THAT YOU COULD
HAVE GROUNDS FOR A LAWSUIT

34:29.768 --> 34:31.570
