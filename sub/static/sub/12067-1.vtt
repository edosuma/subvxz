02:33.636 --> 02:34.685
Who's there?

04:28.792 --> 04:29.958
Sebastian.

04:31.559 --> 04:32.697
Sebastian!

04:32.792 --> 04:34.163
Hmm?

04:34.925 --> 04:36.023
A word.

04:38.424 --> 04:40.662
You have to give me
something, Sebastian.

04:40.925 --> 04:42.797
Something more
than this.

04:43.491 --> 04:45.506
Project scope.

04:46.025 --> 04:49.164
Repatriation
of the long-term comatose.

04:49.165 --> 04:50.124
Hmm.

04:50.154 --> 04:51.347
Progress report:

04:52.265 --> 04:53.374
on track.

04:53.580 --> 04:55.635
- Hmm.
- Two words.

04:55.692 --> 04:58.491
I gave you a page of space.
It was supposed to be a hint.

04:58.626 --> 05:00.622
What did you want me to do,
write an essay?

05:00.759 --> 05:03.566
I don't have time, and they
wouldn't understand it anyway.

05:03.669 --> 05:05.659
I know that.
You know that.

05:05.994 --> 05:07.525
But do they want
to hear that?

05:07.926 --> 05:10.307
You're the chairman,
for God's sake.

05:10.342 --> 05:13.257
I'm the chairman
of a pack of sharks.

05:13.292 --> 05:15.093
They smell blood
in the water,

05:15.128 --> 05:16.800
they'll rip me to pieces.

05:18.995 --> 05:21.393
You know the business
I'm in.

05:21.428 --> 05:23.160
It's not medicine.

05:23.295 --> 05:25.005
It's PR.

05:26.562 --> 05:30.011
And I can't pretend that that
nurse business helped either.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.534
Though I'm not responsible
every time so prepubescent

05:32.569 --> 05:34.922
gets cold feet and decides
to bugger off.

05:34.957 --> 05:37.818
Look, don't bring the curtain
down on me.

05:37.853 --> 05:40.097
I'm closer now
than I've ever been.

05:41.385 --> 05:42.607
You better be.

05:43.130 --> 05:44.929
You bloody well
better be.

05:46.231 --> 05:48.777
I can give you
two months maximum.

05:50.065 --> 05:54.300
Then you've got to come up
with some of your own magic.

05:54.309 --> 05:56.039
- Right?
- Right.

05:57.931 --> 06:01.297
You're getting soft in
your old age, you know that?

06:13.613 --> 06:15.307
I feel that my...

06:16.780 --> 06:18.546
I know that my...

06:19.247 --> 06:21.418
I'm sure that my... fuck!

06:21.453 --> 06:23.179
Oh, shit. Shit, shit.

07:06.616 --> 07:07.881
Hello?

07:10.150 --> 07:11.583
Hello?

07:13.716 --> 07:14.881
Matron Cassidy?

07:14.916 --> 07:16.049
You're early.

07:18.549 --> 07:21.016
Oh, the GPS on my phone
knows where I am before I--

07:21.050 --> 07:22.413
Follow me.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.717
Well, you certainly
seem qualified,

07:31.751 --> 07:33.117
academically speaking.

07:33.118 --> 07:36.649
But we're engaged
in more than theory here.

07:36.683 --> 07:38.516
Oh, I'm excited
by this opportunity--

07:38.550 --> 07:40.282
I can't afford to take
any chances.

07:40.317 --> 07:41.883
We don't have
that luxury here.

07:53.985 --> 07:55.683
Traumatic brain injury stream.

07:55.718 --> 07:57.050
Yes.

07:57.085 --> 07:58.384
Result?

07:58.418 --> 08:00.484
High distinction.

08:03.352 --> 08:05.184
The eye characteristic
a grade 2

08:05.218 --> 08:07.551
on the Glasgow Coma Scale.

08:07.586 --> 08:08.751
Oh.

08:08.785 --> 08:12.760
The subject opens eyes in
response to painful stimuli.

08:12.885 --> 08:15.351
Patient has been in a vegetative
state for several months.

08:15.385 --> 08:17.951
What are the complications
to the digestive system?

08:17.986 --> 08:20.784
An excess secretion
of stomach acids.

08:20.820 --> 08:23.552
With an increased risk
of gastric ulceration.

08:23.587 --> 08:25.352
So you're an expert.

08:25.386 --> 08:28.552
Are you going to tell me
how to do my job?

08:28.587 --> 08:30.785
No, Doctor.

08:30.820 --> 08:32.086
Mm-hmm.

08:36.020 --> 08:38.652
We're doing remarkable
things here.

08:38.686 --> 08:42.919
Are you ready to do remarkable
things, Miss Jacquard?

08:42.953 --> 08:45.186
Yes.

08:45.221 --> 08:46.654
Yes, I am.

08:49.388 --> 08:50.919
Hire her.

08:57.955 --> 09:00.029
The pay is minimum,
the hours abominable,

09:00.064 --> 09:01.054
and I reserve the right

09:01.088 --> 09:03.488
to terminate your
employment without notice.

09:05.122 --> 09:06.788
Agreed?

09:09.555 --> 09:11.988
Hmm. Not a bad fit.

09:12.022 --> 09:14.454
It's almost new, too.

09:14.489 --> 09:18.687
The last one wasn't around
long enough to get it all grimy.

09:18.722 --> 09:20.021
What happened?

09:20.055 --> 09:22.223
Mmm... I don't know.

09:22.257 --> 09:24.955
I came in one day and the
ice queen told me she was gone.

09:25.290 --> 09:28.622
Got the impression
she went AWOL.

09:28.656 --> 09:31.054
This place has a
revolving door on it.

09:31.089 --> 09:34.089
I'm the only one stupid enough
to stick around.

09:34.124 --> 09:36.255
Oh, shit. Sorry.

09:36.289 --> 09:39.055
I'm not selling it very well,
am I?

09:41.656 --> 09:43.789
Crusty old place, isn't it?

09:43.824 --> 09:45.989
Used to be a convent.

09:46.023 --> 09:48.989
Rooms no one's been in
for years.

09:49.023 --> 09:50.688
Bit of a maze, really.

09:52.024 --> 09:54.423
Couple of the other nurses
reckoned it was haunted.

09:54.457 --> 09:57.524
But the only spook I've ever
seen around here is Cassidy.

09:57.558 --> 10:00.056
She's not exactly
friendly, is she?

10:01.191 --> 10:02.591
It's mostly bark.

10:02.625 --> 10:05.356
Still, you can't really blame
her for being a bit cranky.

10:05.390 --> 10:06.789
She grew up in here.

10:06.824 --> 10:08.990
No dolls or party dresses
for her.

10:09.024 --> 10:10.689
Just Dr. Roget
and the zombies.

10:10.724 --> 10:13.091
Oh, she grew up here?
What do you mean?

10:13.126 --> 10:14.857
Yeah. You didn't know?

10:14.891 --> 10:16.924
She's his daughter.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.725
I suppose they don't
advertise it.

10:19.759 --> 10:21.956
It's kind of cute
in a creepy way.

10:21.991 --> 10:23.824
Went to the family
business.

10:26.592 --> 10:30.091
I have heard that she did
have a life once outside.

10:30.126 --> 10:32.359
Well, a husband,
at least.

10:37.127 --> 10:40.057
Supposedly he offed himself.

10:41.626 --> 10:43.058
I can hardly blame him.

10:48.527 --> 10:50.192
What's the doctor like?

10:50.227 --> 10:51.426
Roget?

10:51.460 --> 10:54.160
Um, lives in his
own world.

10:54.194 --> 10:56.526
Down in the lab
most of the time.

10:56.560 --> 10:58.259
Strictly off limits.

10:58.293 --> 10:59.859
But you're the, um,
specialist.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.626
You'll be helping him out
up here.

11:01.660 --> 11:06.526
My strengths are bodily fluids
and sponge baths.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.427
Ready to meet
the party crowd?

11:11.827 --> 11:13.027
Car crash, motorcycle,

11:13.061 --> 11:15.960
complications
from brain surgery,

11:15.995 --> 11:19.127
stroke, boot to the head,
unlucky,

11:19.161 --> 11:23.361
and hit a sand bar
diving off a pier.

11:24.794 --> 11:25.960
My God.

11:25.995 --> 11:28.294
What about visitors?
Relatives?

11:28.329 --> 11:30.561
Count them on one hand.

11:30.596 --> 11:32.194
People end up down here

11:32.229 --> 11:33.629
because they're pretty much
forgotten.

11:37.561 --> 11:39.394
It's an involuntary
muscle reaction.

11:39.429 --> 11:40.628
It doesn't mean anything.

11:40.662 --> 11:41.960
Sorry. I know.

11:41.995 --> 11:43.162
You'll get used to it.

11:43.196 --> 11:44.894
At least you'd better hope
you do.

11:46.130 --> 11:48.129
Nurse Williams.

11:48.164 --> 11:51.229
A moment in my office,
please.

12:34.365 --> 12:36.930
Whatever pickup line he used,
it worked.

12:39.932 --> 12:43.731
Patrick, Kathy.
Kathy, Patrick.

12:47.399 --> 12:48.931
He's pristine.

12:50.932 --> 12:52.397
The muscle tone.

12:52.432 --> 12:54.098
There's no wasting.

12:54.133 --> 12:55.897
How?

12:57.533 --> 12:59.233
Electrical treatments.
Drugs.

12:59.267 --> 13:01.465
I don't really know.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.499
He's Roget's
special project.

13:03.533 --> 13:06.333
What happened to him?

13:06.366 --> 13:07.831
Some kind of accident
with his family.

13:07.865 --> 13:09.665
I think he was
the only survivor.

13:12.933 --> 13:14.098
Hello, Patrick.

13:19.934 --> 13:22.299
I felt like it was
on purpose.

13:22.334 --> 13:24.133
Oh, if there's one thing
about our friend Patrick,

13:24.167 --> 13:25.965
he doesn't do anything
on purpose.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.466
It's an involuntary--
Muscle reaction.

13:28.501 --> 13:30.200
You're learning fast.

13:54.235 --> 13:55.801
Hello?

14:09.302 --> 14:10.668
That's fine.
Let him go.

14:11.769 --> 14:14.435
That's fine.
Well, fine for him.

14:14.469 --> 14:15.902
That's Mr. Fraser,

14:15.937 --> 14:17.935
our resident athlete.

14:17.969 --> 14:19.834
What happened to him?

14:19.869 --> 14:21.568
Electrical explosion.

14:21.603 --> 14:25.369
He was a railway signalman,
whatever that is.

14:25.403 --> 14:27.202
Come on.

14:33.703 --> 14:35.703
He's obsessed with time.

14:35.738 --> 14:39.636
Well, being on time.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.003
On time for what?

14:41.037 --> 14:42.303
Shh.

14:45.304 --> 14:46.703
Come here.

14:51.472 --> 14:53.271
He does it
every night.

14:53.305 --> 14:55.438
Sometimes he sits up there
till the morning,

14:55.472 --> 14:57.203
just to switch it off.

14:57.238 --> 14:59.203
It was Roget's idea.

14:59.238 --> 15:01.271
He was a total basket case

15:01.305 --> 15:03.637
before he had something
to focus on.

15:06.173 --> 15:08.371
The thing hadn't been
switched on in years.

15:11.406 --> 15:12.804
Why is he here?

15:12.839 --> 15:14.937
I mean, he can
definitely walk.

15:14.971 --> 15:17.771
As far as I know
he came in the normal way:

15:17.805 --> 15:20.505
on his back,
dead to the world.

15:22.540 --> 15:24.305
Roget managed
to wake him up.

16:46.643 --> 16:48.575
God!

16:51.443 --> 16:54.276
Kathy, open up.

16:54.310 --> 16:55.808
Paula, you scared the crap
out of me.

16:55.843 --> 16:57.010
What's wrong?

16:57.044 --> 16:59.676
I'm bored
out of my skull.

16:59.710 --> 17:01.043
Five minutes.
Get changed.

17:01.077 --> 17:02.910
Go on.

17:02.945 --> 17:05.041
Go on.

17:05.076 --> 17:06.642
Just one, love.

17:06.675 --> 17:07.843
And here she comes.

17:07.877 --> 17:09.042
See you later.

17:10.145 --> 17:11.844
See you later.

17:11.877 --> 17:13.377
Someone's popular.

17:13.411 --> 17:14.609
Oh, you will be too.

17:14.644 --> 17:18.044
And I promise, not everyone
who drinks here is--

17:18.078 --> 17:19.444
Like that?
Exactly.

17:20.310 --> 17:21.910
Cheers.
Cheers.

17:23.645 --> 17:26.344
I mean,
only if you're, um,

17:26.377 --> 17:28.377
looking for...

17:28.412 --> 17:30.910
a distraction.

17:34.779 --> 17:36.645
Tan line
on the ring finger.

17:39.912 --> 17:42.978
You know when people say,
"It's not you, it's me"?

17:43.013 --> 17:44.645
Mm-hmm.
It was me.

17:45.712 --> 17:47.579
You played some away game.

17:47.614 --> 17:48.778
No.

17:48.812 --> 17:50.612
It was nothing
like that.

18:00.679 --> 18:02.646
- Hey, I'll see you later.
- Yeah, mate.

18:03.980 --> 18:05.712
Nurse Williams.

18:05.747 --> 18:08.280
Always a healing sight.

18:08.314 --> 18:09.946
Hello, we haven't met.

18:11.514 --> 18:13.447
Dr. Brian Wright,
this is Kathy--

18:13.481 --> 18:15.180
Jacquard.

18:15.214 --> 18:16.480
Kathy's our latest
arrival.

18:16.515 --> 18:18.347
Another of the belles
among the brain-dead.

18:20.014 --> 18:21.413
Seat's empty, Brian.

18:21.447 --> 18:22.780
Can't.

18:22.814 --> 18:24.280
Deadline looms.

18:24.314 --> 18:26.747
Just came down to pick up
a bottle of inspiration.

18:26.781 --> 18:29.080
But soon. Deal?

18:29.115 --> 18:30.481
Hmm.

18:34.349 --> 18:36.813
So, what do you think?

18:38.249 --> 18:39.880
He's a bit sure
of himself.

18:39.914 --> 18:41.248
Did you say doctor?

18:41.282 --> 18:42.547
Psychiatrist.

18:42.581 --> 18:44.681
I don't think he practices much
anymore, though.

18:44.715 --> 18:46.948
He writes,
and he's on the radio.

18:46.981 --> 18:49.282
He has an amazing
beach house

18:49.316 --> 18:51.681
and a really nice place
in the city too.

18:52.749 --> 18:54.649
Mm-hmm.

18:54.683 --> 18:55.848
What?

18:55.882 --> 18:58.516
- Mmm?
- Once or twice.

18:58.550 --> 18:59.948
Uh-huh.

18:59.982 --> 19:01.981
Okay, maybe more than
a few times.

19:03.317 --> 19:05.315
But it was a very,
very long time ago.

19:05.350 --> 19:07.649
And I don't have dibs on him
if you want to...

19:07.683 --> 19:09.250
I just...

19:09.284 --> 19:10.849
You move fast, right?

19:25.152 --> 19:27.316
We've had a death.

19:34.484 --> 19:37.316
It's, um,
diving accident.

19:39.852 --> 19:41.117
Funny, you know.
When they go,

19:41.152 --> 19:43.684
you realize you sort of become
quite attached to them.

20:49.788 --> 20:50.920
Doctor.

20:52.188 --> 20:53.919
This patient isn't dead.

20:53.954 --> 20:56.488
No need for it
down here, then.

20:56.522 --> 20:58.554
Put it back.

20:58.588 --> 21:00.388
See me at room 15.

21:06.088 --> 21:08.054
Once the medication
is administered

21:08.088 --> 21:11.855
the window of opportunity
is vanishingly small.

21:11.889 --> 21:14.589
We're waking up
dormant neurons,

21:14.624 --> 21:17.289
goading them into making
new connections.

21:17.323 --> 21:19.055
And they're mercurial
little bastards.

21:19.089 --> 21:20.922
Very hard to train.

21:20.957 --> 21:23.622
We only have a matter of minutes
to get them to do what we want

21:23.656 --> 21:25.788
before the drug
wears off.

21:25.822 --> 21:28.322
So you follow my instructions
to the letter.

21:28.357 --> 21:29.555
Yes, Doctor.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.656
But when that door opens,

21:31.690 --> 21:34.256
your old ways die.

21:35.691 --> 21:39.123
We're trailblazers,
do you understand?

21:43.490 --> 21:45.690
He spits, you know.

22:06.858 --> 22:08.424
Ophthalmoscope.

22:11.959 --> 22:13.958
Retinal vessel perfusion
distinct.

22:24.059 --> 22:27.192
Perturbation peaking at...

22:29.193 --> 22:30.425
...four seconds.

22:31.793 --> 22:35.358
Perturbing the base line
in eight seconds.

22:44.860 --> 22:47.660
Slightly perturbed
frontal lobe.

22:47.694 --> 22:48.959
Returning to base line...

22:50.593 --> 22:51.893
...in three seconds now.

22:51.927 --> 22:53.261
Damn.

22:54.360 --> 22:56.493
Too much attenuation.

22:56.528 --> 22:59.193
Clean up the patient,
nurse.

23:04.761 --> 23:06.594
Okay, Patrick.
This might sting a bit.

23:08.662 --> 23:09.826
What did you say?

23:10.895 --> 23:12.161
Oh, nothing, Doctor.

23:12.195 --> 23:13.826
I was just talking to him,
I suppose.

23:15.094 --> 23:16.394
What were you
discussing?

23:20.562 --> 23:22.128
Doctor, are you
absolutely certain

23:22.163 --> 23:23.328
that he isn't aware
of us?

23:23.363 --> 23:25.128
Nurse Jacquard,

23:25.163 --> 23:27.595
I have monitored him
for 24 hours a day

23:27.630 --> 23:30.494
with an EEG that registers
every kind of brainwave

23:30.529 --> 23:32.694
from a fart
to a nervous breakdown.

23:32.728 --> 23:34.794
What do you suppose
it has registered?

23:34.828 --> 23:36.094
I don't know, Doctor.

23:36.129 --> 23:37.795
Just farts.

24:01.397 --> 24:03.063
You're wasting your time,
Kath.

24:03.097 --> 24:05.197
Nothing grows in here.

24:05.231 --> 24:07.329
It must be all the, um,

24:07.364 --> 24:10.263
electrical stuff.

24:10.297 --> 24:12.863
It's a wonder we don't
glow in the dark.

24:19.131 --> 24:21.631
Okay.

24:21.665 --> 24:24.797
I might have said something
to Brian

24:24.831 --> 24:26.797
about taking you
for dinner.

24:26.831 --> 24:29.130
You could have asked me first.
- Fine. Shut me up.

24:29.165 --> 24:30.531
Say you'll think
about it.

24:30.565 --> 24:31.730
I'll think about it.

24:31.765 --> 24:33.365
Jesus, Kathy.

24:33.399 --> 24:34.564
Up, up.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.865
I'm not trying to sell you
for body parts.

24:36.899 --> 24:38.231
- Got him?
- Yes.

24:38.266 --> 24:41.064
Do you know with a ridiculously
attractive man,

24:41.098 --> 24:44.064
you spend way too much time here
at the vegetable farm.

24:44.098 --> 24:46.664
Once in a while you should
speak to someone

24:46.698 --> 24:47.931
other than a turnip.

24:49.266 --> 24:50.698
Shit.

24:52.066 --> 24:54.199
Stupid thing.

24:54.233 --> 24:56.232
You can go,

24:56.267 --> 24:58.699
and I'll finish up here.

24:58.733 --> 25:00.033
Good.

25:34.569 --> 25:37.901
Is anybody in there?

25:37.935 --> 25:39.400
Nurse Jacquard.

25:39.434 --> 25:41.200
What do you think
you're doing?

25:41.234 --> 25:43.301
Attending--
- And who instructed you

25:43.335 --> 25:46.733
you try to engage
this patient in conversation?

25:48.636 --> 25:50.934
Step outside, please.

25:50.969 --> 25:54.235
I will make myself
very plain.

25:54.270 --> 25:56.035
You will not be given
the opportunity to hear me...

25:58.069 --> 26:00.068
...say this again.

26:00.102 --> 26:03.435
This facility presents
special challenges

26:03.470 --> 26:04.636
to those who work here,

26:04.670 --> 26:06.001
both for the body...

26:07.236 --> 26:08.436
and for the mind.

26:10.137 --> 26:13.303
You will not invest
emotionally

26:13.337 --> 26:14.503
in any of the patients here.

26:22.503 --> 26:24.136
- Am I understood?
- Yes.

26:47.138 --> 26:48.638
Kathy.

26:50.339 --> 26:52.370
- Brian, isn't it?
- Yes.

26:52.404 --> 26:54.804
Never really liked it,
but I got used to it.

26:56.272 --> 26:58.704
I'm recklessly
avoiding a deadline.

26:58.738 --> 27:00.471
What's your excuse?

27:00.505 --> 27:03.404
Just wanted to get out.

27:03.438 --> 27:06.238
Needed somewhere cheery,
right?

27:08.473 --> 27:11.205
So, what do you make
of Patrick?

27:12.273 --> 27:13.905
How do you know
about him?

27:13.939 --> 27:15.605
Williams.

27:15.640 --> 27:18.071
Not much she doesn't
talk about.

27:18.105 --> 27:19.506
Well, technically,

27:19.541 --> 27:21.905
she's breaking her
confidentiality agreement.

27:21.939 --> 27:24.706
Not sure if I should
as well.

27:24.740 --> 27:28.105
The Roget veil of secrecy.

27:31.506 --> 27:33.173
Do you think it's possible

27:33.207 --> 27:35.073
that patients
in a vegetative state

27:35.107 --> 27:36.473
can be aware?

27:36.507 --> 27:39.706
Well, I guess that depends
on the quality of the diagnosis.

27:39.740 --> 27:41.540
One of the tests
for a vegetative state

27:41.574 --> 27:42.906
is that there is
no awareness.

27:42.940 --> 27:46.074
Over-hopeful families
see meaningless twitches,

27:46.107 --> 27:48.105
and read signs
of responsiveness.

27:48.140 --> 27:50.240
I'm skeptical by nature,

27:50.275 --> 27:51.440
and by training.

28:04.942 --> 28:06.541
Don't know what this says
about me exactly,

28:06.575 --> 28:08.906
but I'm feeling
a bit peckish.

28:08.940 --> 28:10.375
There's a place
around the corner.

28:10.409 --> 28:14.175
Two-thirds, maybe even
three-quarters decent coffee.

28:15.676 --> 28:17.175
All right.

28:21.009 --> 28:22.908
What the hell
did you do that for?

30:12.715 --> 30:14.079
Paula, I really don't

30:14.113 --> 30:16.514
feel like going out.

30:16.549 --> 30:18.446
How about staying in?

30:20.281 --> 30:23.447
I'm sorry for whatever I did,

30:23.482 --> 30:26.014
or didn't do, the other day.

30:26.049 --> 30:28.415
I honestly can't remember
a thing.

30:30.115 --> 30:32.281
Thank you.

30:32.315 --> 30:33.648
You're a great cook.

30:33.682 --> 30:35.347
Yes, I am.

30:36.815 --> 30:38.248
Actually, I can't take
all the credit.

30:38.283 --> 30:39.514
They did most
of the work.

30:39.549 --> 30:41.248
Fresh Corn.

30:41.283 --> 30:43.015
Poor little things didn't know
what they were in for

30:43.049 --> 30:45.248
when they woke up this morning.

30:45.283 --> 30:46.583
Then again, who does?

30:46.617 --> 30:48.582
Cheers to that.

30:53.916 --> 30:55.482
What are you looking at?

31:00.317 --> 31:01.816
Ed.

31:01.850 --> 31:03.716
Hey.

31:03.750 --> 31:05.583
How did you find me?

31:05.617 --> 31:08.016
Oh, it's not hard to find
people these days, Kath.

31:08.051 --> 31:10.549
We have to talk.

31:10.583 --> 31:11.749
Leave.

31:11.784 --> 31:13.550
There. Talking's finished.

31:13.584 --> 31:15.816
Kath!

31:15.850 --> 31:18.050
I think you should go.

31:18.084 --> 31:19.317
It's fine, Brian.

31:19.351 --> 31:21.717
Well, I'm staying
at the boat sheds.

31:21.751 --> 31:24.317
I'm not going to leave
till we sort this out, yeah?

31:28.385 --> 31:29.783
- You okay?
- Yeah.

31:32.751 --> 31:35.484
I think you should go too.

31:35.518 --> 31:38.285
Look, I think I should stay.

31:47.985 --> 31:49.884
- Shit.
- Oh, my God. What happened?

31:49.918 --> 31:52.018
Oh, my God.

31:58.086 --> 31:59.452
Shit.

33:04.356 --> 33:05.921
Christ, Brian.

34:20.525 --> 34:21.757
Nurse.

34:28.426 --> 34:30.426
See to the patient.

34:40.726 --> 34:42.458
Ah! Oh, God!

34:42.494 --> 34:44.760
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

34:52.460 --> 34:54.092
You felt that,
didn't you?

35:01.795 --> 35:04.161
Patrick, can you hear me?

35:07.295 --> 35:09.427
Can you see me?

35:09.461 --> 35:12.027
Once for yes, twice for no.

35:16.663 --> 35:18.694
Can you feel that?

35:24.564 --> 35:26.094
That?

35:36.664 --> 35:37.895
That?

35:40.930 --> 35:43.096
That?

36:00.165 --> 36:02.329
When you have a moment.

36:02.363 --> 36:03.729
My office.

36:05.064 --> 36:06.597
You have to listen to me.
Patrick is--

36:06.631 --> 36:09.363
Not your concern.

36:09.398 --> 36:10.830
He cried.

36:10.864 --> 36:12.497
I was communicating
with him.

36:12.531 --> 36:15.964
Nurse, these personal
experiments of yours

36:15.998 --> 36:18.198
will cease immediately.

36:19.965 --> 36:22.030
You will keep your eyes down,

36:22.065 --> 36:24.630
your mouth shut,
your nose clean,

36:24.665 --> 36:27.598
and your hands off.

36:29.965 --> 36:31.199
Am I perfectly clear?

36:32.599 --> 36:34.264
Dismissed.

36:45.800 --> 36:46.965
But he...

36:47.000 --> 36:48.165
he...

36:48.200 --> 36:49.831
Would be better off dead.

36:51.733 --> 36:53.300
They all would.

36:56.534 --> 36:58.098
Nurse.

36:58.132 --> 36:59.798
Show me.

37:07.267 --> 37:09.400
Patrick, show the doctor
that you can hear me.

37:09.434 --> 37:10.966
Same as before.

37:13.801 --> 37:16.067
Patrick, show that you
can hear me.

37:19.267 --> 37:21.367
He was communicating
with me.

37:21.402 --> 37:23.700
How?
Spitting.

37:44.403 --> 37:46.203
Alive. Correct?

37:47.536 --> 37:49.268
Hmm.

37:58.203 --> 38:00.967
Dead. Agreed?

38:01.003 --> 38:03.135
Now, to imitate life...

38:10.204 --> 38:12.102
...all bodily movement,

38:12.136 --> 38:13.935
voluntary or otherwise,

38:13.969 --> 38:16.069
depends upon electricity.

38:16.103 --> 38:18.170
Stimulate the right
nerve centers,

38:18.205 --> 38:19.636
and you see what happens.

38:20.704 --> 38:22.836
Although he is a vegetable,

38:22.870 --> 38:26.271
electrons still swarm
around inside 15's head.

38:26.306 --> 38:27.504
Every now and then

38:27.538 --> 38:29.736
enough of them
randomly conspire

38:29.770 --> 38:31.203
to cause an action.

38:31.237 --> 38:33.637
It signifies nothing.

38:34.937 --> 38:36.737
As much as I would
wish it otherwise,

38:36.771 --> 38:40.304
he is currently
160 pounds

38:40.338 --> 38:41.805
of limp meat

38:41.839 --> 38:44.572
hanging off
a dead brain.

38:44.606 --> 38:46.338
Do you understand?

38:48.405 --> 38:50.304
Do you understand?

38:52.038 --> 38:53.538
Hmm.

40:21.642 --> 40:23.742
Transcribe, please, nurse.

40:37.043 --> 40:38.210
zero.

40:38.244 --> 40:41.542
five seconds.

40:41.577 --> 40:44.243
Patterns are eccentric and
seem to bear little relation

40:44.277 --> 40:46.042
to expected outcome.

40:52.078 --> 40:55.211
Patrick, you can hear me now,
can't you?

40:57.910 --> 41:00.244
Why won't you
show the doctor?

41:12.313 --> 41:14.511
On phase two...

41:15.678 --> 41:18.645
Remember to tell me when
he has a bowel movement, yes?

41:18.680 --> 41:19.811
Hmm.

41:21.845 --> 41:23.878
...Plus 90 seconds.

41:23.913 --> 41:25.378
Perhaps there's something
there.

41:25.413 --> 41:28.144
I doubt it's the output.

41:28.179 --> 41:31.679
Time plus 180 seconds.

41:31.713 --> 41:33.312
What am I missing?

41:33.346 --> 41:34.612
Patterns are eccentric...

41:37.546 --> 41:40.079
Kathy, could you give me a hand
next door?

41:42.913 --> 41:44.080
Kathy!

41:45.314 --> 41:47.546
Sorry. Oh, I wasn't
concentrating.

41:47.581 --> 41:49.780
That's my job.

41:49.815 --> 41:51.045
Next door?

42:15.648 --> 42:17.102
I don't require you.

42:17.182 --> 42:19.281
Where on earth
did you get that from?

42:19.316 --> 42:22.315
I won it in a raffle.

42:24.516 --> 42:27.315
Doctor, this patient cannot
possibly give consent!

42:27.349 --> 42:30.715
Indeed not, so I give consent
on his behalf.

42:31.981 --> 42:35.048
Patrick, show him!

42:36.649 --> 42:37.915
What good can it do?

42:42.982 --> 42:46.082
Despite not being obliged
to answer your questions, nurse,

42:46.116 --> 42:48.048
I will tell you again.

42:48.083 --> 42:51.683
Our endeavors rely on my being
able to forge new connections

42:51.717 --> 42:53.549
in 15's brain.

42:53.584 --> 42:56.583
To do that, I need
to stir things up a bit.

42:56.617 --> 43:00.116
I cannot do it
with a feather duster.

43:02.784 --> 43:06.149
Now that you're here,
you can see to the patient.

43:07.584 --> 43:10.383
He's not getting
any younger.

43:10.418 --> 43:12.183
And neither am I.

43:14.951 --> 43:16.550
Patrick.

43:20.452 --> 43:22.684
Can you fell that?

43:44.085 --> 43:46.419
Ed Penhaligon
in a place like this?

43:46.453 --> 43:48.785
Better not let the golf club
find out.

43:48.819 --> 43:51.352
I'm sure they've revoked
memberships for less.

44:10.821 --> 44:13.687
Coming in from the outside,
your family...

44:15.288 --> 44:18.885
Everyone is so
spectacular,

44:18.920 --> 44:21.087
or expected to be.

44:25.954 --> 44:27.588
What did you want me to do
about it?

44:27.622 --> 44:29.953
Stand up to them.

44:29.987 --> 44:33.887
Let them know, let me know,
that I'm good enough for you.

44:33.922 --> 44:35.555
More than good enough.

44:37.455 --> 44:39.487
I never thought
anything else, Jacs.

44:50.690 --> 44:51.955
- Come here.
- Mm...

44:51.989 --> 44:54.055
Come here. Come here.

44:54.090 --> 44:55.221
You can do it.

45:04.656 --> 45:06.823
I think we need a drink.

45:38.024 --> 45:40.156
Ed, is something burning?

45:47.492 --> 45:48.692
Ed?

45:49.524 --> 45:50.569
Ed!

46:02.859 --> 46:05.158
We're keeping him under
for a while.

46:05.193 --> 46:08.458
In some ways, he's lucky
the trauma is so severe.

46:08.492 --> 46:10.692
No nerves left,
no pain.

46:10.726 --> 46:11.991
Yet.

46:12.026 --> 46:13.426
It'll come, though.

46:13.460 --> 46:16.058
But how the hell
did it happen?

46:16.093 --> 46:18.226
A sandwich grill?

46:21.927 --> 46:23.059
Ouch.

46:36.293 --> 46:37.993
Patrick.

46:38.028 --> 46:39.393
Can you hear me?

47:01.362 --> 47:03.027
Do you want
the doctors stopped?

47:06.661 --> 47:07.994
Why, Patrick?

47:11.928 --> 47:13.195
Why is it a secret,
Patrick?

47:18.197 --> 47:19.362
Patrick?

47:22.295 --> 47:23.728
Patrick.

48:04.164 --> 48:05.431
Patrick?

48:09.932 --> 48:11.163
Patrick?

48:11.198 --> 48:12.598
Are you asleep?

48:22.532 --> 48:25.432
If you're awake, Patrick,
then why won't you show anyone?

48:30.833 --> 48:33.499
But why just me, Patrick?
Why no one else?

48:41.166 --> 48:42.298
Kathy?

48:48.267 --> 48:50.433
I'll leave you two alone.

48:55.234 --> 48:57.165
You still don't remember
anything?

48:57.200 --> 48:59.033
Nothing.

48:59.067 --> 49:00.899
Just you screaming.

49:02.234 --> 49:04.367
Psychologist came in
yesterday.

49:04.401 --> 49:07.601
They're going to do
epilepsy tests now.

49:08.702 --> 49:10.800
So the folks
are going to fly in.

49:10.835 --> 49:12.799
Mom's doing the full
theatrics.

49:16.868 --> 49:21.061
Ed, have I ever
seemed delusional to you?

49:21.768 --> 49:23.868
You? God no.

49:26.236 --> 49:28.801
It's this patient
at work.

49:28.836 --> 49:30.134
Patrick.

49:31.568 --> 49:33.767
Whenever I'm around,
he...

49:35.402 --> 49:37.235
What is it, Jacs?

49:38.703 --> 49:41.501
It all seems
so ridiculous.

49:42.902 --> 49:46.068
Hey, when I get
out of here,

49:46.103 --> 49:47.603
we're getting out
of here.

49:48.669 --> 49:49.901
Deal?

49:52.270 --> 49:54.035
We'll see.

50:04.338 --> 50:06.402
Transcribe.

50:14.638 --> 50:15.803
Patrick?

50:15.838 --> 50:17.903
You said that you wanted me
to help you.

50:24.671 --> 50:26.403
But you must need help.

50:26.438 --> 50:28.570
I've seen what the doctor
does to you.

50:30.838 --> 50:32.371
I don't understand.

50:48.539 --> 50:50.239
Patrick?

51:07.707 --> 51:09.706
You'll kill him.

51:09.740 --> 51:11.506
You know that,
don't you?

51:15.541 --> 51:17.306
Mmm.

51:27.441 --> 51:29.139
Unethical things, Brian.

51:29.173 --> 51:30.341
Like what?

51:30.375 --> 51:31.641
Little or no protocols,

51:31.675 --> 51:34.207
unorthodox methods,
treatment without consent.

51:34.242 --> 51:35.574
What specifically?

51:35.609 --> 51:37.641
Well, he's using
a shock therapy machine.

51:37.675 --> 51:40.608
The thing looks like it fell off
the back of a truck in the '20s.

51:40.642 --> 51:44.140
Shock therapy on coma patients?
What the hell for?

51:44.174 --> 51:46.807
To try to blast them
back to life?

51:46.842 --> 51:48.241
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

51:48.275 --> 51:50.207
Look, I'm telling you now,
all right?

51:50.242 --> 51:51.475
I'm going to make
a few calls.

51:51.509 --> 51:52.675
To the department?

51:52.710 --> 51:54.108
To the money.

51:54.142 --> 51:55.408
Give me a day.

51:55.444 --> 51:57.342
Thank you.

51:57.375 --> 51:58.574
I really mean it.

52:05.676 --> 52:08.575
What are you hiding from,
Patrick?

52:12.176 --> 52:13.743
Watching what?

52:36.677 --> 52:38.110
What do you know,
Patrick?

52:44.844 --> 52:47.010
I don't need you
to do that, Patrick.

53:03.679 --> 53:05.910
What have you been
telling your boyfriend?

53:05.945 --> 53:07.112
Ed?

53:07.146 --> 53:09.178
That fucking peacock
on the radio.

53:09.213 --> 53:11.144
Brian?

53:11.178 --> 53:12.911
He's been calling
with questions.

53:12.946 --> 53:14.278
What does he know?

53:17.313 --> 53:19.112
You're going to have
to ask him.

53:25.912 --> 53:28.145
Did you have to push
so hard?

53:28.179 --> 53:29.945
What did you
expect me to do?

53:29.979 --> 53:31.746
I don't really know.

53:31.780 --> 53:33.512
Some kind
of middle ground.

53:33.547 --> 53:35.279
There isn't one.

53:35.313 --> 53:36.680
This is big.

53:36.715 --> 53:38.213
Establishment money.

53:38.248 --> 53:40.613
Medical malpractice.

53:40.647 --> 53:42.847
The lights are going to get
shut off and the locks changed.

53:42.881 --> 53:44.280
That's the way
these things happen.

53:44.314 --> 53:46.446
But Patrick, he...

53:46.480 --> 53:47.680
He's...

53:47.715 --> 53:49.347
He's what?

53:53.314 --> 53:55.179
When will little happen?

53:55.214 --> 53:57.180
Soon.

53:57.215 --> 53:59.047
I'm going to come
and get you.

53:59.081 --> 54:02.548
I'll call. If you're there
you drop everything, understand?

54:02.582 --> 54:04.847
Okay.

54:16.682 --> 54:18.515
I've done something
to help you.

54:48.784 --> 54:52.350
We're not always the best judges
of what we need, Patrick.

54:52.384 --> 54:54.217
You said so yourself.

55:04.951 --> 55:07.016
I don't think I'll be here
much longer.

55:07.051 --> 55:09.217
You're going
to have to decide.

55:09.252 --> 55:11.284
Stay in your own world
alone,

55:11.318 --> 55:13.318
or let other people in.

55:14.619 --> 55:17.551
I can't, I won't,
be the only one.

55:27.252 --> 55:30.884
You have one new voice message.

55:30.918 --> 55:35.552
Received at 1:00 p.m.

55:35.586 --> 55:37.784
Sebastian, it's Morris.

55:37.818 --> 55:39.452
I don't know what the fuck
has happened,

55:39.486 --> 55:41.285
but the knives are out.

55:41.319 --> 55:43.652
There's talk of an emergency
board meeting.

55:43.686 --> 55:45.785
I'm stalling them,
but I'm running out of excuses.

55:45.819 --> 55:49.453
Whatever you've got,
show it and show it now.

56:02.520 --> 56:04.986
Hi, this is Kathy.

56:06.987 --> 56:07.986
Ow!

56:31.088 --> 56:33.520
Shit!

56:46.457 --> 56:47.755
Ow!

56:49.258 --> 56:50.488
Ow!

56:56.323 --> 56:58.256
Please fasten your seat belt.

57:55.593 --> 57:57.791
This is ending now.

57:58.625 --> 58:00.360
You can't pummel him
into submission.

58:00.394 --> 58:02.225
You're here to wipe up
mucous and urine.

58:02.260 --> 58:04.391
I don't give a shit
what you have to say.

58:05.560 --> 58:06.958
You will.

58:09.159 --> 58:11.559
Nurse Jacquard.

58:20.494 --> 58:21.825
Do you believe in God?

58:24.760 --> 58:26.126
I don't.

58:26.160 --> 58:28.159
But I do believe
in fate.

58:28.193 --> 58:30.227
You see, I didn't choose
any of this.

58:30.262 --> 58:32.160
It chose me.

58:32.194 --> 58:34.593
And when you've been cursed
with true insight,

58:34.628 --> 58:37.093
half the answer
is never enough.

58:37.128 --> 58:41.394
Now, I have clawed my way up
the cliff face by my fingertips.

58:41.428 --> 58:44.460
It has taken me decades
to get a glimpse of the peak.

58:44.494 --> 58:46.761
And I don't have a minute
to spare.

58:46.795 --> 58:49.960
Now, you are a prissy,
meddling little bitch

58:49.994 --> 58:52.128
who's wasting my precious time,

58:52.162 --> 58:55.695
and I would dearly love you
to fuck off.

59:02.363 --> 59:04.628
I'm finally reaching you.

59:04.662 --> 59:08.462
Everything I know
screams it out to me.

59:08.496 --> 59:13.462
I'll make hiding in there
worse than being ripped out.

59:13.496 --> 59:14.928
Hi, this is Brian.

59:14.963 --> 59:16.428
I can't get to the phone
right now,

59:16.463 --> 59:17.895
so please leave a message.

59:17.929 --> 59:20.663
Brian, it's Kathy.
Roget is insane.

59:20.696 --> 59:23.629
Whatever you're going to do,
you do it now and call me.

59:51.266 --> 59:52.531
Kathy!

01:00:05.765 --> 01:00:07.831
Both of you, out.

01:00:07.866 --> 01:00:09.031
Now.

01:00:18.599 --> 01:00:19.732
Nurse.

01:00:45.234 --> 01:00:46.967
Hey, hey.

01:00:47.001 --> 01:00:48.599
Ah!

01:00:51.099 --> 01:00:52.899
Ah! Oh!

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:57.000
She died in anguish,
you know.

01:00:57.034 --> 01:00:59.167
My mother.

01:00:59.201 --> 01:01:01.333
She knew that
after she was gone,

01:01:01.368 --> 01:01:04.234
all that was left for me
was this.

01:01:04.269 --> 01:01:06.566
She never understood.

01:01:08.101 --> 01:01:11.768
But you do.
I know you do.

01:01:15.569 --> 01:01:16.800
Shh.

01:01:25.535 --> 01:01:27.701
I'm shocked and saddened

01:01:27.736 --> 01:01:30.168
to have to tell you
that colleague and friend,

01:01:30.202 --> 01:01:33.602
Dr. Brian Wright,
has been found dead.

01:01:33.637 --> 01:01:36.435
The report states
that police divers

01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:37.769
have recovered his body

01:01:37.803 --> 01:01:40.502
from the waters below
the Old Coast Road.

01:01:40.536 --> 01:01:43.869
He has been sent
to punish us.

01:01:43.902 --> 01:01:46.135
No, no, no, Julia.

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:47.869
He's our legacy.

01:01:47.903 --> 01:01:49.802
Everything we worked for.

01:01:49.836 --> 01:01:53.003
I am this close.
I can't give up now.

01:01:53.036 --> 01:01:56.069
You've got no idea
what you've done, Father.

01:02:03.871 --> 01:02:05.802
Julia.
No.

01:02:05.836 --> 01:02:07.069
I--

01:02:07.103 --> 01:02:09.003
You. You killed him.

01:02:09.037 --> 01:02:10.870
- Killed who?
- Brian.

01:02:10.904 --> 01:02:12.338
Dr. Wright.
You killed him.

01:02:12.372 --> 01:02:15.836
Oh, believe me, if I had it's
not an accomplishment I'd deny.

01:02:17.305 --> 01:02:19.537
What are you going to do
with those, give me a haircut?

01:02:19.572 --> 01:02:20.903
Get rid of her.

01:02:23.605 --> 01:02:25.571
No need, Matron.
I'm leaving.

01:02:25.605 --> 01:02:27.003
But I'll be back

01:02:27.037 --> 01:02:28.904
with the licensing board
and the police.

01:02:46.439 --> 01:02:48.406
If you leave,

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:51.505
it will all
be your fault.

01:03:32.075 --> 01:03:33.974
You mustn't go back
to the clinic.

01:03:35.575 --> 01:03:37.274
Not ever.

01:03:49.009 --> 01:03:50.676
My father has done
terrible things.

01:03:50.709 --> 01:03:53.975
I've done terrible things.

01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:57.742
We will be punished
for them.

01:03:57.776 --> 01:03:59.376
But it's not us
you have to fear.

01:04:06.577 --> 01:04:09.941
The only thing more dangerous
than his hate...

01:04:11.209 --> 01:04:12.841
is his love.

01:04:24.878 --> 01:04:27.177
I was planning to settle this
by other means,

01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:31.443
but I'm too tired
for any of that now.

01:04:46.878 --> 01:04:48.510
Kathy.

01:04:48.544 --> 01:04:49.911
- Ed?
- Kath, you all right?

01:04:49.945 --> 01:04:51.478
Oh.

01:04:51.512 --> 01:04:53.511
Please, Kathy,
what's going on?

01:04:58.312 --> 01:04:59.445
I, um...

01:05:02.945 --> 01:05:04.413
I'll call you back.

01:05:04.447 --> 01:05:06.044
Just tell me--

01:05:14.212 --> 01:05:16.146
Where the hell
have you been?

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:20.446
You've been called to the city.
An accident crash.

01:05:20.481 --> 01:05:23.179
Male victim,
severe head trauma.

01:05:23.213 --> 01:05:24.812
You were asked for
by name.

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:27.646
The family have money.

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.079
Lots of it.

01:06:03.548 --> 01:06:05.214
Williams.

01:06:05.249 --> 01:06:06.614
Um, I was just, um--

01:06:06.649 --> 01:06:08.947
Do you have
your car here?

01:06:08.982 --> 01:06:10.948
Um...yes.

01:06:10.983 --> 01:06:12.582
We're out of ammonia.

01:06:12.616 --> 01:06:15.181
There's none left
in the storeroom.

01:06:15.216 --> 01:06:16.548
They won't have it
at the general store.

01:06:16.583 --> 01:06:18.781
You'll have to drive
into town.

01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:22.782
- How much do you want?
- Go.

01:06:24.283 --> 01:06:25.750
- Are you all right?
- Now.

01:06:56.784 --> 01:06:58.417
You're a cancer.

01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:02.984
And you need
to be cut out.

01:07:44.887 --> 01:07:47.986
<i>Police divers have recovered
his body from the waters...</i>

01:07:50.086 --> 01:07:51.287
Ed!

01:08:08.355 --> 01:08:10.320
- Hi, this is Ed.
- Please leave a message.

01:08:11.954 --> 01:08:15.120
I can't explain it,
but you have to believe me.

01:08:15.155 --> 01:08:17.854
Everyone close to me
is in terrible danger.

01:08:17.889 --> 01:08:20.520
As soon as you get this,
leave.

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:22.354
It must be radio waves
or something.

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:24.854
Just get over the mountains.

01:08:24.889 --> 01:08:26.220
Please run.

01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:40.656
I'm not yours, Patrick!

01:08:40.689 --> 01:08:42.356
I never will be!

01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:46.087
You're a sick, twisted,
pathetic child, do you hear me?!

01:09:23.057 --> 01:09:25.457
When you first came
I pitied you.

01:09:25.491 --> 01:09:28.823
Even more than the others.
You were so...

01:09:28.858 --> 01:09:31.189
beautiful.

01:09:31.224 --> 01:09:34.425
But then I realized
what you were.

01:09:40.858 --> 01:09:42.625
I'm not yours, Patrick!

01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:44.224
I never will be!

01:09:44.259 --> 01:09:47.524
You're a sick, twisted,
pathetic child, do you hear me?

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:55.493
Hi, this is Kathy.

01:09:55.527 --> 01:09:57.259
I can't take your call...

01:10:50.796 --> 01:10:52.995
You were such a prize
for my father.

01:10:53.029 --> 01:10:55.261
A puzzle he thought
he could solve.

01:10:56.595 --> 01:10:58.662
But he has woken you

01:10:58.696 --> 01:11:02.861
in ways that he will never
understand.

01:11:27.331 --> 01:11:29.530
Good night, Patrick.

01:11:29.564 --> 01:11:30.862
Lights out.

01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:38.863
Huh?

01:12:12.199 --> 01:12:13.898
Your little boy is here.

01:12:18.965 --> 01:12:20.232
Get out of here.

01:12:23.366 --> 01:12:25.299
You pathetic
little creep.

01:12:25.333 --> 01:12:28.165
All you do is sneak around
and perv.

01:12:29.567 --> 01:12:31.865
Is this what you want to see?
Huh?

01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:34.299
Go on,
take a good look.

01:13:11.935 --> 01:13:13.402
Julia?

01:13:49.404 --> 01:13:51.036
Kathy!

01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:52.337
Kathy!

01:13:55.538 --> 01:13:56.870
Kathy!

01:13:58.937 --> 01:14:00.235
Kathy!

01:14:03.737 --> 01:14:04.869
Hello?

01:14:06.138 --> 01:14:08.037
Is there anybody here?

01:14:10.739 --> 01:14:12.338
Hi, I'm looking for,
um, Kathy Jacquard.

01:14:12.372 --> 01:14:13.771
Is she here?

01:14:16.439 --> 01:14:18.304
Uh, excuse me.

01:14:18.338 --> 01:14:19.970
Hello?

01:14:23.739 --> 01:14:26.105
I'm not sure if you understood.
I'm looking for Kathy?

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:37.171
Can you tell me
where Kathy is?

01:14:37.206 --> 01:14:39.205
She's in danger.

01:14:39.339 --> 01:14:41.506
You understand?

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.406
Excuse me.

01:14:56.408 --> 01:14:58.773
Hey! Hey!

01:15:01.474 --> 01:15:03.206
Hey!

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:05.806
Let me out! Hey!

01:15:39.742 --> 01:15:41.341
Paula!

01:15:42.576 --> 01:15:43.776
Paula!

01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:51.574
Paula!

01:16:20.445 --> 01:16:23.277
Patrick...

01:16:23.312 --> 01:16:27.511
wants his hand job.

01:16:40.845 --> 01:16:41.977
Paula.

01:16:44.045 --> 01:16:45.611
- Patrick wants his hand job.
- Patrick wants his hand job.

01:16:45.645 --> 01:16:47.143
Patrick wants his hand job.

01:16:47.178 --> 01:16:49.211
Patrick wants his hand job...

01:16:52.913 --> 01:16:54.378
Paula!

01:16:54.413 --> 01:16:56.111
- Patrick wants his hand job.
- Patrick wants his hand job.

01:16:56.145 --> 01:16:57.680
Patrick wants his hand job.

01:16:57.714 --> 01:16:59.479
Shut up!

01:17:04.513 --> 01:17:06.145
Paula.

01:17:23.814 --> 01:17:25.646
Patrick, no.

01:17:26.913 --> 01:17:29.213
She's done nothing to you.
Please.

01:17:29.247 --> 01:17:31.480
Please let her go.

01:17:34.581 --> 01:17:35.880
Kathy?

01:17:38.015 --> 01:17:38.980
No!

01:17:39.015 --> 01:17:40.647
Paula!

01:17:46.981 --> 01:17:49.147
Yeah. I'm okay.

01:18:11.784 --> 01:18:13.617
No!

01:18:18.316 --> 01:18:19.716
Let me in!

01:18:20.850 --> 01:18:22.182
Let me in!

01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:25.783
Just end this now!

01:18:28.216 --> 01:18:30.850
You're pathetic.
What are you scared of?

01:18:36.917 --> 01:18:38.950
You think you love me,
Patrick?

01:18:38.984 --> 01:18:40.750
You don't know
how to love.

01:18:43.050 --> 01:18:44.717
Did you love your mother?

01:18:58.218 --> 01:18:59.984
What did you think,
Patrick?

01:19:00.019 --> 01:19:01.850
That if you stopped other men
from getting to me

01:19:01.885 --> 01:19:04.118
that we'd be together
forever?

01:19:12.084 --> 01:19:13.351
Who?

01:19:15.486 --> 01:19:16.884
Who?!

01:19:20.086 --> 01:19:21.419
Ed?

01:19:21.453 --> 01:19:23.552
Ed! Answer me! Ed!

01:19:23.585 --> 01:19:25.685
Let me in!

01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:29.752
Where is he?

01:19:32.919 --> 01:19:34.520
Where is he?

01:19:40.121 --> 01:19:42.119
Ed?

01:19:49.554 --> 01:19:51.020
"Cold."

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:04.954
Ed?

01:20:23.254 --> 01:20:24.421
Ed?

01:21:40.959 --> 01:21:42.725
He made me.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:49.025
You fucking lunatic.

01:21:55.726 --> 01:21:58.125
Where is he?
Just tell me!

01:22:05.227 --> 01:22:06.694
Don't!

01:22:06.728 --> 01:22:08.059
Doctor!

01:22:08.093 --> 01:22:09.427
Please!

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:12.560
Let me out!

01:22:25.196 --> 01:22:27.928
I told you to get out of here,
you little perv.

01:22:59.596 --> 01:23:01.230
Get out!

01:24:59.401 --> 01:25:01.167
- Ed.
- Help!

01:25:01.201 --> 01:25:02.600
Jesus, Ed.

01:25:02.735 --> 01:25:04.301
Come on!

01:25:07.636 --> 01:25:09.269
Let him out!

01:25:09.303 --> 01:25:11.202
Help!

01:25:11.436 --> 01:25:13.936
Please, please,
please let him out!

01:25:20.003 --> 01:25:21.535
Can't move it.

01:25:25.070 --> 01:25:26.668
Help!

01:25:26.802 --> 01:25:28.769
No! Patrick!

01:25:30.037 --> 01:25:32.136
Patrick!
No! Stop!

01:25:39.170 --> 01:25:41.337
How do I join you?
How?

01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:45.537
What do you
want me to do?

01:26:24.473 --> 01:26:26.639
Ah! Ah!

01:26:46.241 --> 01:26:47.839
How?

01:27:27.808 --> 01:27:30.375
I want to join you,
Patrick.

01:27:30.409 --> 01:27:31.408
I do.

01:27:31.443 --> 01:27:33.041
I want to be with you.

01:27:33.075 --> 01:27:34.542
But I'm weak.

01:27:34.576 --> 01:27:36.508
I'm scared.

01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:40.109
You have to help me.

01:30:18.084 --> 01:30:19.715
Kathy.

01:30:35.984 --> 01:30:38.317
So this is Patrick.

01:31:41.354 --> 01:31:43.053
- Good morning, Matron.
- Good morning, nurse.

01:31:43.087 --> 01:31:44.087
Your package arrived.

01:31:44.121 --> 01:31:46.519
- Thank you.
- Great, thanks.

01:31:46.954 --> 01:31:48.187
Oh, nurse.

01:31:48.221 --> 01:31:50.053
I'll be occupied
until after lunch.

01:31:50.087 --> 01:31:51.353
That's fine.

01:32:26.518 --> 01:32:28.323
