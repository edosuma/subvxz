WEBVTT

00:04.468 --> 00:06.469
Thanks for coming to meet me.

00:08.189 --> 00:10.473
I half-thought that Brody guy
was gonna be with you, and

00:10.508 --> 00:11.591
I didn't think you'd want to

00:11.625 --> 00:13.259
spend your first Valentine's Day apart.

00:13.294 --> 00:15.094
Yeah, it's actually a little bit
of a point of contention

00:15.129 --> 00:16.629
between the two of us.

00:16.664 --> 00:18.114
He was... I don't know,
weirded out,

00:18.148 --> 00:19.332
about going to a stranger's wedding,

00:19.366 --> 00:20.867
and so I... Okay.
Okay, cool, cool.

00:20.918 --> 00:22.452
So I-I don't really need to hear
about your new boyfriend

00:22.486 --> 00:24.370
that you're living with, all right?

00:26.156 --> 00:27.440
Finn, what's going on right now?

00:27.474 --> 00:29.175
You look like you
slept in those clothes.

00:29.210 --> 00:30.960
And you won't even look at me.

00:30.994 --> 00:32.595
I kissed Miss Pillsbury.

00:34.348 --> 00:35.465
Did she kiss you back?

00:35.499 --> 00:37.016
No, she was totally freaked out by it.

00:37.051 --> 00:38.468
I don't even know how it happened.

00:38.502 --> 00:39.669
We've been spending all this time

00:39.687 --> 00:41.387
together, and then...

00:41.438 --> 00:44.340
she was there, and I just
felt the need to...

00:45.509 --> 00:46.809
And I kissed her, and I...

00:46.843 --> 00:48.194
Does Mr. Shue know?

00:48.229 --> 00:49.395
I don't... I don't think so.

00:49.446 --> 00:51.314
I don't think she'd tell him, but...

00:51.348 --> 00:52.198
maybe I should.
No.

00:52.233 --> 00:54.150
Don't. Just... don't.

00:54.184 --> 00:55.068
Okay?

00:55.119 --> 00:56.319
Remember how you felt about Puck

00:56.353 --> 00:57.520
when you found out about him and Quinn?

00:57.538 --> 00:58.655
You kicked a garbage can.

00:58.689 --> 01:00.490
I'm the worst person in the world!

01:00.524 --> 01:01.574
No, you're not.

01:01.625 --> 01:03.326
What you did, it wasn't

01:03.360 --> 01:04.694
great, but I get it.

01:04.712 --> 01:07.046
You're confused,
and... and lonely.

01:07.081 --> 01:08.998
I'm sure that...

01:09.032 --> 01:10.700
just knowing about Brody
and I living together,

01:10.718 --> 01:12.001
it-it set you off.

01:12.035 --> 01:14.053
Not everything has to do with you.

01:20.394 --> 01:21.928
Look, I don't know what to do.

01:23.230 --> 01:24.597
You always wanted to be an actor, right?

01:24.648 --> 01:25.765
So here's your chance to play the role

01:25.816 --> 01:26.933
of the supportive best man.

01:39.613 --> 01:40.830
(school bell ringing)

01:42.065 --> 01:43.750
Um...

01:45.569 --> 01:46.836
Oh, God...

01:49.573 --> 01:51.758
I'd feel a lot more comfortable

01:51.792 --> 01:53.593
if this door stayed open.
The whole wall

01:53.627 --> 01:55.712
is glass, and there's like
50 kids walking by.

01:55.746 --> 01:57.079
I don't have time for this, Finn.

01:57.097 --> 01:58.381
Seriously, this seating chart

01:58.415 --> 01:59.766
is like a giant sudoku.

01:59.800 --> 02:00.883
Will wants his mother
as far away from the bar

02:00.917 --> 02:02.101
as possible, and all of you Glee kids

02:02.136 --> 02:03.770
have dated so incestuously that I can't

02:03.804 --> 02:05.221
even remember who can tolerate
who anymore, so...

02:05.255 --> 02:07.223
Look, I'm-I'm worried
about not being able

02:07.257 --> 02:09.892
to do this. Being able to look
Mr. Shue in the eyes. I...

02:09.925 --> 02:11.561
Look, I'm really sorry

02:11.595 --> 02:13.229
that I don't have a pamphlet
handy for you right now,

02:13.263 --> 02:15.231
but I'm pretty sure if I did,
it would say something like,

02:15.265 --> 02:17.784
"Get Over It," okay?

02:17.818 --> 02:19.452
My therapist says that I use my OCD

02:19.486 --> 02:21.904
to control the uncontrollable.
Ever since I was

02:21.938 --> 02:24.073
a little kid, I would plan
and plan and plan all

02:24.107 --> 02:25.458
my birthday parties
but never actually went through

02:25.492 --> 02:26.909
with any of them
because they were never ready

02:26.943 --> 02:28.995
by the time my birthday
actually rolled around.

02:29.046 --> 02:31.581
I just wanted to help you. Look,
when I get on that altar,

02:31.615 --> 02:33.299
and I make my solemn vows for the second

02:33.334 --> 02:35.585
and, I hope, the very last time,

02:35.619 --> 02:38.120
standing right behind my husband
will be his best man.

02:38.138 --> 02:41.140
That's you... the guy who thought
it was okay to kiss me

02:41.175 --> 02:42.308
a week before my wedding.

02:42.343 --> 02:43.593
The guy who is forcing me

02:43.627 --> 02:44.927
to lie to my fiancÃ©.

02:44.961 --> 02:47.180
And if you really want to help me,

02:47.231 --> 02:51.100
then just keep a wide berth
and keep your mouth shut.

02:51.134 --> 02:53.436
How's my nervous

02:53.470 --> 02:54.771
little bride doing?

02:54.805 --> 02:56.189
Um, good, I just, I just

02:56.240 --> 02:57.490
really could use some
help with this seating...

02:57.524 --> 02:59.025
Right after Glee practice, I promise.

03:01.695 --> 03:03.496
Okay.

03:03.530 --> 03:05.531
Come on, Finn.

03:06.650 --> 03:09.952
Okay.

03:09.986 --> 03:11.788
(school bell ringing) Glee Club!

03:11.822 --> 03:14.290
(applause, cheering,
whistling and chatter)

03:14.324 --> 03:15.958
Mr. Shue, how was D.C.?

03:15.992 --> 03:19.212
D.C. was great,
but now I am back to stay.

03:19.263 --> 03:21.297
Holla! And so, for my
first order of business,

03:21.331 --> 03:24.183
I want to give a big shout-out
to the guy who made sure

03:24.218 --> 03:27.002
I had something to come back
to... Mr. Finn Hudson.

03:27.021 --> 03:29.022
(cheering and applause)

03:29.056 --> 03:32.392
Now... for this week's
assignment...

03:32.443 --> 03:33.526
I hope it's Britney again.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.528
ALL:
Oh!

03:35.562 --> 03:37.530
Ha, ha, ha!

03:37.564 --> 03:40.733
Miss Pillsbury and I are finally
getting married.

03:40.784 --> 03:42.035
Yeah!
Which makes me the happiest,

03:42.069 --> 03:43.403
luckiest man alive.

03:43.454 --> 03:45.238
Now, Emma has been
handling all the prep,

03:45.289 --> 03:47.156
so to help out,
I thought I'd take charge

03:47.190 --> 03:48.741
of the entertainment for the reception.

03:48.792 --> 03:50.410
And though this goes against tradition,

03:50.461 --> 03:52.745
it would mean the world
to me and to Emma

03:52.796 --> 03:55.331
if, instead of giving your
best man's speech, Finn,

03:55.365 --> 03:56.966
you sing for us.

03:58.435 --> 03:59.502
What do you think?

03:59.536 --> 04:03.506
Uh... uh, yeah, of course.

04:03.540 --> 04:04.874
Perfect.
(laughs)

04:04.892 --> 04:07.009
For everyone else who isn't
out with Asian bird flu...

04:07.043 --> 04:08.244
It wasn't me.

04:08.278 --> 04:09.679
...it's a Valentine's
Day wedding, which means,

04:09.713 --> 04:10.847
we need some great romantic

04:10.881 --> 04:12.098
love songs at the reception.

04:12.149 --> 04:14.267
Wait. You want <i>us</i>
to be your wedding singers?

04:14.318 --> 04:16.017
That is so...
Awesome.

04:16.052 --> 04:17.185
We'd be honored.

04:17.220 --> 04:19.053
Great. I have
some great ideas.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.575
(school bell ringing) Oh.

04:22.609 --> 04:24.077
So, her name is Betty.

04:24.111 --> 04:25.695
She's gonna be sitting next to you.

04:25.729 --> 04:29.082
She's my niece, she's blonde,
she's an amazing singer,

04:29.116 --> 04:32.201
and she has...
um, very large, uh...

04:32.235 --> 04:33.119
Feet?

04:33.170 --> 04:34.036
Boobies.

04:34.070 --> 04:35.538
Oh. Oh, my.

04:35.572 --> 04:37.072
(laughs, clears throat)

04:37.091 --> 04:38.374
Uh, Miss Pillsbury,

04:38.408 --> 04:39.926
are you okay?
What, me? Yeah, I'm fine.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.094
Your locker's not, though.

04:41.128 --> 04:42.261
It's flu season.

04:42.296 --> 04:43.629
I can practically see the virus

04:43.680 --> 04:45.047
growing in here.

04:45.081 --> 04:47.266
I'm sorry. It's just
a little bit

04:47.301 --> 04:49.135
of residual wedding stress.

04:49.186 --> 04:51.053
Nothing that any bride wouldn't feel

04:51.087 --> 04:52.054
this close to her big day, though.

04:52.088 --> 04:52.855
Right?

04:54.925 --> 04:59.929
So, I know it's not
Valentine's Day yet, but

04:59.947 --> 05:02.949
I wanted you to open this now.

05:06.370 --> 05:08.821
They're cuff links.

05:08.872 --> 05:10.339
I made it myself from
this old typewriter

05:10.374 --> 05:12.074
my mom and I found at a garage sale.

05:12.108 --> 05:13.910
I just wanted you to have them early

05:13.944 --> 05:15.962
so you could wear them
to Mr. Shue's wedding.

05:15.996 --> 05:18.831
These are so cool, but I can't
wait to give you your gift.

05:18.882 --> 05:20.299
You're gonna love it.

05:20.334 --> 05:21.918
I love it already,
I don't care what it is.

05:21.952 --> 05:24.003
I'll meet you after Spanish class, okay?

05:28.625 --> 05:30.977
Dude, you did get her something, right?

05:31.011 --> 05:34.013
Not yet, but I've got some ideas.

05:34.064 --> 05:36.098
I've been brainstorming with my brother.

05:36.132 --> 05:38.267
You said she has some kind
of eating disorder thing, right?

05:38.301 --> 05:40.520
Yeah. Take her out to dinner.
Save a bunch of cash.

05:40.571 --> 05:41.988
Then you can use that extra money

05:42.022 --> 05:43.489
to buy a ton of different lingerie.

05:43.524 --> 05:46.692
Have her put on a fashion show.
Chicks love fashion.

05:46.743 --> 05:48.611
Dude, I know you're, like,
related to that guy,

05:48.645 --> 05:50.980
but he's kind of creepy and
currently dating a sophomore.

05:50.998 --> 05:53.282
All right, I'm not
letting you do any of that.

05:53.316 --> 05:54.784
Dude, I don't know about this stuff.

05:54.818 --> 05:56.819
Okay, those are the
only ideas that I had.

05:56.837 --> 05:58.454
You want to do something romantic.

05:58.488 --> 06:00.790
Something she's gonna remember
for the rest of her life.

06:00.824 --> 06:03.292
Well, it's not like I can afford
diamond earrings or a Bentley.

06:03.326 --> 06:04.961
It's not how much money you put into it.

06:04.995 --> 06:07.547
It's about how much of <i>you</i>
you put it into it.

06:07.598 --> 06:08.831
Well, you got some ideas?

06:08.849 --> 06:11.000
A bunch, which is why
you're going to forget

06:11.018 --> 06:15.154
about Valentine's <i>Day</i>
and make it Valentine's <i>Week.</i>

06:15.189 --> 06:17.139
Genius.
Mm-hmm.

06:17.173 --> 06:19.141
Thank you. Say hi to
Mrs. Sanchez for me.

06:19.175 --> 06:21.143
Okay. (Sighs)

06:21.177 --> 06:23.178
(school bell ringing)

06:26.900 --> 06:29.151
Where have you been? I asked
you to come, like, an hour ago.

06:29.185 --> 06:30.820
I was getting a spray-tan.
Mr. Shue asked me

06:30.854 --> 06:32.655
to sing him a song as my best man toast.

06:32.689 --> 06:35.157
So far, I've narrowed it down
to "Confessions" by Usher,

06:35.191 --> 06:38.995
"My Best Friend's Girl," and
"Lyin' Eyes" by the Eagles.

06:39.029 --> 06:40.997
I can't... I can't go through with this.
You're gonna

06:41.031 --> 06:42.665
be fine, all right? I'll sing
with you. We can do a duet.

06:42.699 --> 06:44.333
I'll take the lead, and you can just

06:44.367 --> 06:45.668
sway in the background.

06:45.702 --> 06:48.588
Right. Well, I think
the real issue here is,

06:48.639 --> 06:50.756
whether or not
you can handle singing with me.

06:50.807 --> 06:53.509
I mean, we do have some pretty
dangerous musical chemistry.

06:53.543 --> 06:56.345
I think I can control myself.

06:56.379 --> 06:59.599
Although, I will admit,
you do look very cute right now.

07:01.652 --> 07:03.636
I've been dieting.

07:07.557 --> 07:09.108
I'll pick out a song.
(clears throat)

07:09.159 --> 07:11.027
(school bell ringing)

07:11.061 --> 07:13.195
WILL: So eagles sit at the
top of the food chain.

07:13.229 --> 07:14.447
Their lifting power
is about four pounds.

07:14.498 --> 07:16.365
It's like a small baby.

07:16.399 --> 07:18.200
Okay, what is going on with you?

07:18.234 --> 07:20.202
Did you buy more of those
11-hour energy shots?

07:20.236 --> 07:21.921
Because there's a reason
they're illegal in Canada.

07:21.955 --> 07:23.756
Nothing's going on.
What could be going on?

07:23.790 --> 07:26.241
It's history class.

07:27.294 --> 07:29.211
(whispering) All right.

07:29.245 --> 07:31.097
WILL: Jacob, you've
got the floor.

07:31.131 --> 07:32.431
Hello. This is kind of
embarrassing,

07:32.466 --> 07:34.300
but...
Jake, what are you doing?!

07:34.351 --> 07:35.635
Are you really standing up

07:35.686 --> 07:36.552
in front of everyone

07:36.586 --> 07:37.637
and singing to prove your love

07:37.688 --> 07:38.638
for Marley?

07:38.689 --> 07:40.723
Yes, Ryder. Yes, I am. Wow.

07:40.757 --> 07:42.708
That's so crazy and
emotionally vulnerable.

07:42.743 --> 07:44.126
I had no idea.

07:44.161 --> 07:45.328
Oh, wait.

07:45.362 --> 07:47.880
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.

07:47.914 --> 07:49.882
Marley, I know this is one
of your favorite songs,

07:49.916 --> 07:51.384
so this is for you.

07:51.418 --> 07:53.552
("You're All I Need to Get By" begins)

07:53.587 --> 07:58.140
âª <i>You're all I need</i> âª

07:58.175 --> 08:00.309
âª <i>To get by</i> âª

08:00.344 --> 08:03.062
âª <i>I, I</i> âª

08:03.096 --> 08:04.397
âª <i>You're all</i> âª

08:04.431 --> 08:06.849
âª Like sweet morning dew âª <i>I need</i> âª

08:06.883 --> 08:09.068
âª I took one look at you âª <i>To get by</i> âª

08:09.102 --> 08:10.653
âª And it was plain to see

08:10.687 --> 08:13.572
âª <i>I, I</i> âª âª You were my destiny

08:13.607 --> 08:16.409
âª <i>You're all</i> âª âª With arms open wide

08:16.443 --> 08:18.828
âª <i>I need</i> âª âª I threw away my pride

08:18.862 --> 08:21.197
âª <i>To get by</i> âª âª I'll sacrifice for you

08:21.231 --> 08:23.532
âª <i>I, I</i> âª âª Dedicate my life to you

08:23.566 --> 08:26.035
âª <i>Oh, oh</i> âª âª I will go where you lead

08:26.069 --> 08:28.204
âª <i>Come on, baby</i> âª
âª Always there in time of need

08:28.238 --> 08:30.423
âª Oh, oh, oh, and when I lose my will âª

08:30.457 --> 08:34.260
âª You'll be there
to push me up the hill âª

08:34.294 --> 08:38.714
BOTH: âª There's no, no
looking back for us âª

08:38.748 --> 08:43.102
âª We got love...
sure enough, that's enough âª

08:43.135 --> 08:45.054
âª You're all

08:45.088 --> 08:47.273
âª You're all I need

08:47.307 --> 08:50.776
âª To get by âª <i>You're all</i> âª

08:50.811 --> 08:53.029
âª <i>I need</i> âª âª Yeah, yeah

08:53.063 --> 08:55.031
âª <i>To get by</i> âª

08:55.065 --> 08:57.233
âª Oh, yeah âª <i>I, I</i> âª

08:57.267 --> 08:58.951
âª Ooh, ooh-oohâª
Listen.

08:58.985 --> 09:00.903
âª <i>You're all</i> âª
âª Like an
eagle protects his nest âª

09:00.937 --> 09:04.040
âª <i>I need</i> âª âª For you, I'll do my best

09:04.074 --> 09:06.625
âª <i>To get by</i> âª âª Stand by you like a tree

09:06.660 --> 09:09.462
âª <i>I, I</i> âª
âª And dare anybody
to try and move me âª

09:09.496 --> 09:11.547
âª <i>You're all</i> âª âª Darling, in you I found

09:11.581 --> 09:14.800
âª <i>I need to get by</i> âª
âª Strength
when I was torn down âª

09:14.835 --> 09:16.635
âª Don't know what's in store âª <i>I, I</i> âª

09:16.670 --> 09:18.721
âª But together we can open any door âª

09:18.755 --> 09:21.474
âª <i>Oh, baby</i> âª
âª Just to
do what's good for you âª

09:21.508 --> 09:24.477
âª <i>Come on, darling, oh, oh</i> âª
âª And
inspire you a little higher âª

09:24.511 --> 09:26.595
âª I know you can make a man

09:26.629 --> 09:28.981
âª Out of a soul
that didn't have a goal âª

09:29.015 --> 09:34.070
BOTH: âª 'Cause we, we got
the right foundation âª

09:34.104 --> 09:38.324
âª And with love and determination âª

09:38.358 --> 09:40.159
âª You're all

09:40.193 --> 09:43.162
âª All the joys under the sun
wrapped up into one âª

09:43.196 --> 09:49.502
âª You're all, you're all I need âª

09:49.536 --> 09:54.173
âª You're all I need

09:54.207 --> 09:56.008
âª You're all I need

09:56.042 --> 09:58.961
âª Oh, to get by

09:58.995 --> 10:00.096
âª All right âª <i>You're all</i> âª

10:00.130 --> 10:01.964
âª I need you, darling âª Oh, oh

10:01.998 --> 10:09.998
âª You're all I need
to get by. âª

10:10.390 --> 10:12.191
(applause)

10:12.225 --> 10:13.476
That was amazing.

10:13.510 --> 10:14.860
You like it?
Oh, my God.

10:14.895 --> 10:15.694
(indistinct chatter)

10:15.729 --> 10:16.862
She liked it.

10:16.897 --> 10:18.397
MARLEY:
That was so romantic.

10:18.448 --> 10:20.449
(indistinct chatter)

10:26.494 --> 10:27.711
(sighs)

10:27.745 --> 10:29.580
It is a Carrot Top convention.

10:35.003 --> 10:37.387
I am so over this,
and it hasn't even started yet.

10:37.422 --> 10:39.339
I'm clearly the hottest bitch
in this lousy joint,

10:39.390 --> 10:41.308
but I'm all alone,
stuck here sitting with you.

10:41.342 --> 10:42.976
Do you want me to slap you again?

10:43.011 --> 10:45.729
I hate weddings,
and I hate Valentine's Day.

10:45.763 --> 10:47.981
They were invented by breeders
to sell cheap chocolate

10:48.016 --> 10:49.266
and false hope.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.767
Do you know what <i>I</i> hate?

10:50.801 --> 10:52.152
Men. Every single

10:52.187 --> 10:55.489
one of them is a pig, except
maybe Mr. Shue and Al Roker.

10:55.523 --> 10:57.157
And you know what?
You were right.

10:57.192 --> 10:59.326
I do let men define me, but not anymore.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.528
Like Gloria Steinem said,
"A woman without a man

11:01.579 --> 11:03.330
is like a fish
without a bicycle."

11:03.364 --> 11:06.283
Al Roker is disgusting, by the way.

11:06.317 --> 11:08.435
(scoffs) Whatever.

11:18.329 --> 11:20.697
Hi. Betty?

11:20.731 --> 11:22.366
Yes? Oh, God.

11:22.400 --> 11:25.586
What? Did I beat you to
the last handicap spot? Sorry.

11:25.620 --> 11:28.205
I'm Artie. Miss Pillsbury said I
should look out for you? (Groans)

11:28.239 --> 11:29.706
Hell, no.
Uh...

11:29.740 --> 11:31.708
No.
Uh...

11:31.742 --> 11:36.096
No. Wheel away. Wheel...
the hell... away.

11:36.130 --> 11:38.882
My aunt told me she was fixing
me up with someone good-looking,

11:38.916 --> 11:41.301
so that was a lie.

11:41.352 --> 11:44.638
Oh. I mean, some people think
I'm kind of nerdy-hot, so...

11:44.689 --> 11:45.639
No, no, no.

11:45.690 --> 11:47.641
Andrew Garfield
is nerdy-hot.

11:47.692 --> 11:50.060
You are Stephen Hawking's
younger brother.

11:50.094 --> 11:52.262
Miss Pillsbury didn't tell you
I was in a wheelchair, did she?

11:52.280 --> 11:55.232
Um, obviously not, because
I don't date losers in chairs.

11:55.266 --> 11:57.234
But you're in a wheelchair.
Yeah,

11:57.268 --> 12:00.437
I'm also blonde, captain of the
cheerleaders at my high school,

12:00.455 --> 12:02.706
and I've got this going on.

12:04.609 --> 12:06.410
JAKE:
<i>You first.</i>

12:06.444 --> 12:08.078
Thank you, sir.
Yep.

12:08.112 --> 12:10.998
Oh, my gosh, Jake.
Are these for me?

12:11.049 --> 12:13.000
Yes?

12:13.051 --> 12:14.451
How did you know I love peonies?

12:14.469 --> 12:16.253
They're the queen of flowers.

12:16.287 --> 12:18.922
RYDER: Because you mentioned
it in the choir room once,

12:18.956 --> 12:20.957
and Jake remembered.
Right, dude?

12:20.975 --> 12:24.127
Right. Yeah.
I love them.

12:24.145 --> 12:26.146
And you.

12:28.966 --> 12:30.967
(whispering):
Thank you.

12:34.805 --> 12:36.273
(moaning)

12:36.307 --> 12:38.442
Had I known I was gonna get
groped in the back of a Prius,

12:38.476 --> 12:39.976
I would've brought a change of clothes.

12:39.994 --> 12:42.479
I'm gonna go in there looking
like <i>Prom: The Morning After.</i>

12:42.497 --> 12:43.947
(moaning) What am I doing?

12:43.981 --> 12:45.449
I'm sort of dating somebody in New York.

12:45.483 --> 12:47.868
Uh, you're not in New York.
And it's not exclusive, right?

12:47.919 --> 12:51.538
You in this fey boy-tie...
it's my Kryptonite.

12:51.589 --> 12:53.790
(moaning) Wait, this doesn't mean
that we're back together, right?

12:53.824 --> 12:56.326
No, no, no. It's-it's cool.
I know, I know. It's-it's...

12:56.344 --> 12:59.379
This is just bros helping bros.
I love it when you talk fratty.

12:59.430 --> 13:01.632
(moaning)

13:01.666 --> 13:02.999
Tell me that's not Tina again!

13:03.017 --> 13:05.469
Hey, can you two wrap
it up? The wedding is

13:05.503 --> 13:07.971
about to start,
and I need my arm-gays.

13:08.005 --> 13:11.007
(shuddering) Oh, my God.

13:13.528 --> 13:16.813
You do realize how trashy
blasphemous this is, right?

13:16.847 --> 13:19.366
Mercedes, everyone hooks
up at weddings. Mm-hmm.

13:19.400 --> 13:23.353
Let's go. This outfit needs an audience.
(church bells ringing)

13:26.357 --> 13:28.024
(door opens)

13:31.879 --> 13:33.863
Oh, my God.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.832
What are you wearing?
What?

13:35.866 --> 13:38.034
This old thing? Why,
it's an exact replica

13:38.052 --> 13:39.336
of your wedding dress.

13:39.370 --> 13:40.504
Why would you do that?

13:40.538 --> 13:42.222
To get back at Will
Schuester for handing

13:42.256 --> 13:44.691
a teaching position to
a flabby 19-year-old.

13:46.744 --> 13:48.195
(Emma hyperventilating)

13:48.246 --> 13:51.531
Um... Sue, I feel really scared.

13:51.582 --> 13:53.000
I feel really overwhelmed.

13:53.034 --> 13:54.167
I feel like I can't

13:54.202 --> 13:56.119
think straight. I'm just
really, really worried

13:56.153 --> 13:57.337
that this isn't gonna work.

13:57.372 --> 13:58.755
Well, of course it isn't going to work.

13:58.790 --> 14:00.957
You're a weird bird-lady
with a hollow pelvis

14:00.991 --> 14:03.043
and OCD, and Will Schuester

14:03.094 --> 14:05.295
is a weepy man-child
whose greatest joy in life

14:05.329 --> 14:07.347
is singing with children
and whose best friend

14:07.382 --> 14:08.632
is 19. It's just, the last time

14:08.666 --> 14:10.517
was such a disaster.
You know, I-I turned

14:10.551 --> 14:12.185
into somebody
that I didn't even recognize.

14:12.220 --> 14:14.221
If I'm wrong again,

14:14.272 --> 14:16.023
I won't survive.
Well,

14:16.057 --> 14:17.357
don't say that to Will Schuester.

14:17.392 --> 14:18.358
He'll have you singing

14:18.393 --> 14:19.860
a stripped-down acoustic version

14:19.894 --> 14:22.145
of "I Will Survive" in front of
a choir room full of teenagers

14:22.179 --> 14:23.814
with meaningful looks on their faces.

14:23.848 --> 14:24.981
God, I can't breathe.

14:25.015 --> 14:26.366
I can't breathe.

14:26.401 --> 14:27.818
I don't feel like there's
any air in here.

14:27.852 --> 14:28.919
(sighs)

14:28.953 --> 14:33.573
WILL:
âª Today is for Emma

14:33.624 --> 14:39.246
âª Emma, I give you the rest of my life âª

14:39.297 --> 14:42.549
âª To cherish and to keep you

14:42.583 --> 14:46.503
âª To honor you forever

14:46.537 --> 14:49.172
âª Today is for Emma

14:49.206 --> 14:56.179
âª My happily soon-to-be wife

14:56.213 --> 14:58.849
Emma, we're really getting married.

14:58.883 --> 15:00.851
âª Pardon me, is everybody there?
Because if everybody's there âª

15:00.885 --> 15:02.736
âª I want to thank you all
for coming to the wedding âª

15:02.770 --> 15:04.237
âª I'd appreciate your going even
more, I mean you must have âª

15:04.272 --> 15:05.856
âª Lots of better things to do,
and not a word of this to Will âª

15:05.890 --> 15:07.657
âª Remember Will, you know,
the man I'm gonna marry, but âª

15:07.692 --> 15:09.409
âª I'm not 'cause I wouldn't ruin
anyone as wonderful as he is âª

15:09.444 --> 15:11.078
âª But I thank you all
for the gifts and the flowers âª

15:11.112 --> 15:12.612
âª Thank you all,
now it's back to the showers âª

15:12.663 --> 15:16.533
âª Don't tell Will, but I'm not
getting married today âª

15:19.170 --> 15:25.959
âª Bless this day, tragedy of life âª

15:26.010 --> 15:28.712
âª Husband yoked to wife

15:28.746 --> 15:36.746
âª The heart sinks down and feels dead âª

15:36.888 --> 15:39.488
âª This dreadful day

15:46.531 --> 15:48.398
Emma,

15:48.432 --> 15:52.786
I can't find my good cuff links.
They're on the dresser.

15:52.820 --> 15:55.789
Right next to my suicide note. âª Listen,
everybody, look, I don't know what you're âª

15:55.823 --> 15:57.741
âª Waiting for, a wedding, what's
a wedding, it's a prehistoric âª

15:57.775 --> 15:59.743
âª Ritual where everybody
promises fidelity forever âª

15:59.777 --> 16:01.411
âª Which is maybe the most
horrifying word I ever heard âª

16:01.445 --> 16:03.630
âª And which is followed by a
honeymoon where suddenly he'll âª

16:03.664 --> 16:05.499
âª Realize he's saddled with a
nut and want to kill me, which âª

16:05.550 --> 16:06.800
âª He should, so thanks a bunch,
but I'm not getting married âª

16:06.834 --> 16:08.802
âª Go have lunch 'cause I'm not getting âª

16:08.836 --> 16:10.504
âª Married, you've been grand,
but I'm not getting married âª

16:10.555 --> 16:11.838
âª Don't just stand there, I'm
not getting married, and don't âª

16:11.889 --> 16:14.474
âª Tell Will, but I'm not getting
married today âª

16:14.509 --> 16:17.310
âª Go, can't you go? Look, you know I
adore you all âª
âª Emma, Emma, I give you

16:17.345 --> 16:20.096
âª But why watch me die like Eliza on the ice?
âª âª The rest of my life

16:20.130 --> 16:23.183
âª But perhaps I'll collapse in the apse right
before you all âª âª To cherish and to keep you

16:23.234 --> 16:26.102
âª So take back the cake, burn the shoes and
boil the rice âª
âª To honor you forever

16:26.136 --> 16:27.571
âª Look, I didn't want to have to
tell you, but I may be coming âª

16:27.605 --> 16:28.688
âª Down with hepatitis
and I think I'm gonna faint âª

16:28.739 --> 16:30.157
âª So if you want to see me faint âª

16:30.191 --> 16:31.608
âª I'll do it happily, but
wouldn't it be funnier to go âª

16:31.642 --> 16:32.659
âª And watch a funeral, so thank
you for âª
âª My adorable wife

16:32.693 --> 16:33.994
âª The 27 dinner plates,
37 butter knives âª

16:34.028 --> 16:35.445
âª 47 paperweights, 57 candleholders âª

16:35.479 --> 16:37.164
âª One more thing
âª I'm not getting married

16:37.198 --> 16:38.615
âª Softly say
âª But I'm not getting married

16:38.649 --> 16:40.033
âª With this ring âª Still
I'm not getting married âª

16:40.084 --> 16:41.535
âª I thee wed
âª See, I'm not getting married

16:41.586 --> 16:47.791
âª Let us pray that we are
getting married today! âª

16:50.044 --> 16:52.045
(crying)

16:54.215 --> 16:56.550
(Richard Wagner's
"Bridal Chorus" playing)

16:58.436 --> 17:00.720
(door opens)

17:22.742 --> 17:25.161
(organ stops abruptly) (attendees gasp)

17:25.194 --> 17:27.414
(indistinct chatter)

17:27.464 --> 17:31.501
(chuckling)

17:31.535 --> 17:34.254
Oh, yeah. Nice to see you all.
(clicks tongue)

17:34.305 --> 17:36.056
Hey, what do you think?

17:36.090 --> 17:37.891
Nice, huh?

17:37.925 --> 17:39.259
Thank you for coming.

17:39.310 --> 17:41.094
Oh, look, it's all the Glee kids.

17:41.145 --> 17:42.646
(mouthing)

17:46.684 --> 17:49.102
Sue. What are you doing?

17:49.153 --> 17:52.772
(quietly): I'm trying to
stop this from becoming

17:52.823 --> 17:54.824
an utter fiasco.

17:57.612 --> 18:00.163
Emma's left the building.

18:00.197 --> 18:03.116
(church bell ringing)

18:10.367 --> 18:13.461
So, did she give you any idea
why she might do this?

18:13.479 --> 18:16.064
I mean, like, leading up
to today, did she...

18:16.098 --> 18:19.300
tell you anything or... She
didn't have to tell me anything.

18:19.318 --> 18:21.186
I left her with all this...

18:21.237 --> 18:23.805
stress and planning.
She was losing it and

18:23.823 --> 18:27.025
I kept telling her that it was
her usual obsessiveness. I...

18:27.076 --> 18:28.610
Yeah, but she left you
at the altar, man.

18:28.644 --> 18:30.195
I mean, that's pretty hard-core.

18:30.246 --> 18:32.213
(sighs)

18:32.248 --> 18:34.082
You think there is something else?

18:34.116 --> 18:35.367
Do you think there's...

18:35.418 --> 18:37.035
do you think there's someone else?

18:37.086 --> 18:39.487
(footsteps approaching) (cough)

18:39.505 --> 18:42.707
I have been chosen,
probably because I'm numb

18:42.758 --> 18:44.709
to other people's feelings,
to come here and ask

18:44.760 --> 18:46.044
what you would like
to do, Mr. Shue.

18:46.095 --> 18:47.161
About what?

18:47.179 --> 18:48.329
Uh, about the reception.

18:48.364 --> 18:49.664
Miss Pillsbury's parents say

18:49.682 --> 18:51.549
they paid for the whole thing, so...

18:51.600 --> 18:53.468
we might as well go ahead
and have the party and...

18:53.502 --> 18:55.387
if you ask me, they seem pretty
happy about what happened.

18:55.438 --> 18:58.172
We can't have a reception now.
Sure you can.

18:58.190 --> 19:00.225
All of you came back,
you should be together.

19:00.276 --> 19:02.677
Just because I ruined my Valentine's Day

19:02.695 --> 19:04.846
doesn't mean I have
to ruin all of yours, too.

19:10.202 --> 19:12.871
I'm gonna go see if I can find Emma.

19:15.958 --> 19:17.959
("Dance Hall Days" by Wang Chung
playing)

19:21.714 --> 19:23.715
Let's go.

19:26.335 --> 19:28.336
(speaking indistinctly)

19:34.810 --> 19:37.095
We all should've known that
a Valentine's Day wedding

19:37.146 --> 19:39.097
was just asking for a disaster.

19:39.148 --> 19:40.482
Love stinks.

19:40.516 --> 19:42.717
Sorry, ladies,
can I see some I.D.?

19:42.735 --> 19:44.102
SANTANA:
I'm 25. Name's Rosario Cruz.

19:44.153 --> 19:45.553
I might be related to Penelope.

19:45.571 --> 19:47.439
You? Emily Stark. Barely legal.

19:47.490 --> 19:50.658
Well, that's good, 'cause I hear
your professors are into that.

19:50.693 --> 19:52.610
You know, we always were two ends

19:52.661 --> 19:54.662
of the same bitch-goddess
spectrum.

19:54.697 --> 19:56.531
Maybe that's why we love
each other so much.

19:56.565 --> 19:58.533
And slap each other.
(chuckles)

19:58.567 --> 20:00.785
You know, I have to say, Rosario,

20:00.836 --> 20:02.837
you are killing it in that dress.

20:03.839 --> 20:06.458
Thanks.

20:06.509 --> 20:09.511
Those romantic saps.
You know, they may have love,

20:09.545 --> 20:10.795
but you know what we are
that they are not?

20:10.846 --> 20:12.964
Flawless.

20:13.015 --> 20:15.016
âª I said

20:16.685 --> 20:18.636
âª Dance hall, dance hall...

20:18.687 --> 20:20.688
I'm gonna go dance.

20:21.941 --> 20:24.592
Dude, you are like some kind
of love genius.

20:24.610 --> 20:26.861
Do you spend all your time
watching Lifetime?

20:26.896 --> 20:29.314
Marley has... a wicked case
of Puckerman fever,

20:29.365 --> 20:31.649
and I just need one more act
of romantic awesomeness

20:31.700 --> 20:33.985
to make the condition fatal.

20:34.036 --> 20:36.738
Do you think maybe just one of
these gifts should be your idea?

20:36.772 --> 20:38.990
No, my ideas suck. I mean,
I tried to write her a poem,

20:39.041 --> 20:40.775
and the only words
that I could come up with

20:40.793 --> 20:44.779
to rhyme with Marley
was "barley" and "gnarly."

20:44.797 --> 20:48.750
Here. It's a heart pendant
from the jeweler at the mall.

20:48.784 --> 20:50.668
It's pretty but it's not too expensive,

20:50.719 --> 20:52.620
so she won't think you stole it.

20:52.638 --> 20:55.507
Okay, I'm going to ignore
the subtly racist overtones

20:55.558 --> 20:58.009
of that comment because you are my hero.

20:58.060 --> 21:00.061
And this is perfect.

21:00.095 --> 21:03.515
I am so getting laid tonight.
What?

21:03.566 --> 21:06.184
Well, I mean, Marley has
wanted to take things slow,

21:06.235 --> 21:08.353
and we have, which is fine, but...

21:08.404 --> 21:10.638
I mean, all this romance
is like nitrous.

21:10.656 --> 21:13.525
I got us a room upstairs
just in case, but...

21:13.576 --> 21:15.527
(sighs) I think it's gonna happen.

21:15.578 --> 21:18.029
She's not ready for that.
She's... she's just a sophomore.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.698
She's still getting over
her eating disorder.

21:20.749 --> 21:23.701
(sighs)

21:23.736 --> 21:27.388
She's not like other girls, okay?

21:27.406 --> 21:29.557
I think I'm in love with her.

21:29.575 --> 21:31.892
And I think she's finally
letting her guard down enough

21:31.911 --> 21:33.394
to love me back.

21:33.412 --> 21:35.780
I promised you
I wouldn't hurt her, right?

21:35.831 --> 21:38.065
Well, I keep my promises.

21:38.083 --> 21:41.068
Especially to friends who are
putting whatever feelings

21:41.086 --> 21:45.089
they're having aside to make
something special happen for me.

21:51.797 --> 21:54.215
âª

21:59.271 --> 22:01.272
(cheering)

22:03.309 --> 22:05.526
(Depeche Mode's "I Just Can't
Get Enough" begins)

22:09.615 --> 22:11.616
âª When I'm with you, baby

22:11.650 --> 22:13.635
âª I go out of my head

22:13.669 --> 22:17.288
âª And I just can't get enough,
and I just can't get enough âª

22:17.323 --> 22:19.273
âª All the things you do to me

22:19.291 --> 22:20.441
âª And everything you said

22:20.459 --> 22:22.627
âª I just can't get enough...

22:22.661 --> 22:24.579
You know that what happened
today isn't your fault, right?

22:25.631 --> 22:27.298
How do you know?

22:27.333 --> 22:28.949
Because I've seen every
runaway bride movie

22:28.968 --> 22:31.452
that there is, and I know
that when the bride runs away,

22:31.470 --> 22:32.637
it's never because

22:32.671 --> 22:34.305
of a random kiss, all right?

22:34.340 --> 22:36.791
It's because she knew, deep down inside,

22:36.809 --> 22:37.959
that it wasn't right.

22:37.993 --> 22:39.727
Well, look, it's not everyday

22:39.745 --> 22:42.447
that we're in the same city,
so let's dance.

22:42.498 --> 22:48.419
âª And I just can't seem
to get enough of... âª

22:54.376 --> 22:56.461
âª We walk together

22:56.512 --> 22:58.379
âª We're walking down the street âª

22:58.413 --> 23:02.467
âª And I just can't get enough,
and I just can't get enough âª

23:02.518 --> 23:03.968
âª Every time I think of you

23:04.019 --> 23:05.687
âª I know we have to meet

23:05.721 --> 23:07.805
âª And I just can't get enough

23:07.856 --> 23:09.691
âª I just can't get enough

23:09.725 --> 23:11.225
âª It's getting hotter

23:11.259 --> 23:12.894
âª It's a burning love

23:12.928 --> 23:15.480
âª And I just can't
seem to get enough... âª

23:15.531 --> 23:17.198
Oh, my God.

23:17.232 --> 23:18.816
Did you not get it before?

23:18.867 --> 23:19.817
Yeah, I did.

23:19.868 --> 23:21.152
More than you know.
You're mean

23:21.203 --> 23:22.403
and you're awful because you're angry

23:22.437 --> 23:23.988
because you're in the chair,
I understand.

23:24.039 --> 23:26.824
Wow, could you be any more
reductive and handi-centric?

23:26.875 --> 23:28.726
I'm fine with my chair.

23:28.761 --> 23:30.995
What I'm not fine with
is suffering fools.

23:31.046 --> 23:32.046
If you think that

23:32.081 --> 23:33.665
makes me mean and awful...
I do.

23:33.716 --> 23:36.718
However, I find you
oddly compelling, so...

23:36.752 --> 23:38.219
will you dance with me?

23:38.253 --> 23:40.888
I'm pretty legendary for my dance moves.

23:45.728 --> 23:47.895
All right, fine. One dance.

23:47.930 --> 23:49.147
That's all I ask.

23:51.400 --> 23:53.467
âª And when it rains

23:53.485 --> 23:55.570
âª You're shining down for me

23:55.604 --> 23:58.439
âª And I just can't get enough,
and I just can't get enough âª

23:58.473 --> 24:01.192
âª Just like a rainbow

24:01.243 --> 24:02.410
âª You know you set me free

24:02.444 --> 24:04.779
âª And I just can't get enough

24:04.813 --> 24:06.864
âª And I just can't get enough âª

24:06.915 --> 24:07.949
âª You're like an angel

24:07.983 --> 24:09.701
âª And you give me your love

24:09.752 --> 24:14.255
âª And I just can't
seem to get enough of... âª

24:21.764 --> 24:25.049
âª I just can't get enough, I
just can't get enough âª
âª <i>Oh</i> âª

24:25.100 --> 24:29.053
âª I just can't get enough,
I just can't get enough âª

24:29.104 --> 24:33.224
âª I just can't get enough, I
just can't get enough âª
âª <i>Oh</i> âª

24:33.275 --> 24:36.894
âª I just can't get enough,
I just can't get enough âª

24:36.945 --> 24:37.979
âª It's getting hotter

24:38.013 --> 24:40.648
âª It's a burning love

24:40.682 --> 24:44.902
âª And I just can't
seem to get enough of. âª

24:44.953 --> 24:46.788
(cheering, applause)

24:48.957 --> 24:51.025
I'm gonna get some punch,
do you want anything?

24:51.043 --> 24:52.293
Uh, yeah, I'll take a cup.

24:52.327 --> 24:53.578
But just remember, we're not...

24:53.629 --> 24:56.080
Dating, we're just here
as friends, I know.

24:56.131 --> 24:57.498
Ooh, big cupcakes.

24:59.534 --> 25:01.803
I don't like the way you treat Blaine.
There, I said it.

25:01.837 --> 25:02.920
You're here, you're in New York,

25:02.971 --> 25:04.422
you're at vogue.com,

25:04.473 --> 25:06.257
you're at NYADA...
who are you, Kurt?

25:06.308 --> 25:07.809
Meanwhile, Blaine is here,

25:07.843 --> 25:11.262
lonely, and yes, he cheated,
and we're all human, Kurt,

25:11.313 --> 25:13.147
we all deserve to be loved back, Kurt.

25:13.182 --> 25:15.099
Okay, Tina.
I say this with total love,

25:15.150 --> 25:17.151
but the moment we all
saw coming is finally here.

25:17.186 --> 25:18.486
You're a hag.
You're hagged out,

25:18.520 --> 25:19.937
you're in love with
Blaine, and it's creepy.

25:19.988 --> 25:20.988
Stop.

25:21.023 --> 25:22.156
What do you know about love?

25:22.191 --> 25:23.491
You just come and go.

25:23.525 --> 25:24.776
Who's been here
to support him? Me.

25:24.827 --> 25:25.827
Who took him to
Sadie Hawkins? Me.

25:25.861 --> 25:27.445
Who put him in bed when he got sick

25:27.496 --> 25:29.530
and rubbed vapor rub
on his little muscled chest

25:29.564 --> 25:31.783
while he slept...
Wait, what? Do you... huh?

25:31.834 --> 25:32.784
What?

25:32.835 --> 25:34.335
No, I didn't mean...
(grunts)

25:34.369 --> 25:36.287
This isn't about me,
Kurt! I have to go.

25:36.338 --> 25:37.872
Did you vapo-rape
my ex-boyfriend?

25:37.906 --> 25:39.507
Don't walk away from me,
Tina Cohen-Chang!

25:39.541 --> 25:42.543
("Habanera" from Bizet's <i>Carmen</i> playing)

25:44.847 --> 25:47.298
Today is the day
we honor Saint Valentine,

25:47.349 --> 25:49.467
a man publicly beheaded
for defying his government,

25:49.518 --> 25:52.303
by exchanging candies and chocolates

25:52.354 --> 25:53.971
to nonsensically render the objects

25:54.022 --> 25:56.307
of our affection more fat

25:56.358 --> 25:57.975
and less attractive.

25:58.010 --> 25:59.310
And in other nonsensical traditions,

25:59.344 --> 26:02.230
Emma left behind her bouquet
as she fled the scene,

26:02.264 --> 26:03.597
leaving it to somebody else

26:03.615 --> 26:05.316
to toss these soon-to-be-dead

26:05.367 --> 26:06.934
flowers under the mythical belief

26:06.952 --> 26:08.486
that whoever catches them

26:08.537 --> 26:11.489
will magically become the
next person to get married,

26:11.540 --> 26:14.242
or, more than likely,
to sprint from the altar.

26:14.276 --> 26:16.377
So gather round,
single ladies, and allow me

26:16.411 --> 26:17.829
to be the one to enable

26:17.880 --> 26:21.215
your false dreams and
ridiculous expectations.

26:34.462 --> 26:36.430
(applause)

26:36.464 --> 26:38.733
âª

26:47.841 --> 26:48.991
That's weird.

26:49.009 --> 26:51.994
See, traditionally only single girls

26:52.012 --> 26:54.464
line up to catch the bouquet.

26:55.766 --> 26:57.967
She loves me.

26:58.001 --> 26:59.552
I <i>am</i> single.

26:59.603 --> 27:01.604
You live with a guy.

27:01.638 --> 27:04.223
She loves me not.
Have you been drinking?

27:04.274 --> 27:05.975
You know, you were the one who told me

27:06.009 --> 27:09.061
to stop moping around and
being such a sad sack.

27:09.112 --> 27:11.447
She loves me.

27:11.482 --> 27:13.566
A-And it got me thinking
about Will and Emma.

27:13.617 --> 27:16.903
About how relationships
are a lot like flowers.

27:16.954 --> 27:19.071
If you find the right seed,

27:19.122 --> 27:21.324
put it in good soil,

27:21.358 --> 27:23.493
give it water and sunlight...

27:23.527 --> 27:26.746
bam, perfect bud.

27:26.797 --> 27:28.915
She loves me not.

27:28.966 --> 27:31.033
And then comes winter

27:31.051 --> 27:33.753
and the flower dies.

27:33.804 --> 27:36.756
But if you tend that garden,

27:36.807 --> 27:38.591
spring will come along

27:38.642 --> 27:42.979
and that flower will bloom again.

27:43.013 --> 27:45.314
She loves me.

27:45.349 --> 27:47.316
Are you telling me
that you want to be a gardener?

27:47.351 --> 27:48.935
I'm asking you how you can

27:48.986 --> 27:51.270
live with a guy but still be single.

27:51.321 --> 27:52.438
She loves me not.

27:52.489 --> 27:53.722
Come on, it's New York, okay?

27:53.740 --> 27:54.941
Haven't you ever seen <i>Sex and the City?</i>

27:54.992 --> 27:56.275
Brody and I had a very

27:56.326 --> 27:57.443
mature conversation.

27:57.494 --> 27:59.612
We just decided that
we're not gonna, you know,

27:59.663 --> 28:02.064
put any labels on anything
or worry about what we are.

28:02.082 --> 28:03.399
She loves me.

28:03.417 --> 28:04.400
So, do you really believe

28:04.418 --> 28:05.651
all that stuff you tell yourself

28:05.686 --> 28:07.303
about, you know, labels

28:07.337 --> 28:09.505
and mature conversations,

28:09.540 --> 28:10.906
<i>Sex and the City,</i> really?

28:10.924 --> 28:12.074
She loves me not.

28:12.092 --> 28:14.410
You think I'm lying to you?

28:14.428 --> 28:18.130
I think you're lying to yourself.

28:18.181 --> 28:19.382
She loves me.

28:19.416 --> 28:20.800
And I think that the reason

28:20.851 --> 28:22.585
you can't really commit
to Brody is because

28:22.603 --> 28:25.972
you're still in love with someone else.

28:26.023 --> 28:27.139
She loves me not.

28:27.190 --> 28:29.358
You?

28:31.261 --> 28:33.112
You and I both know how this thing ends.

28:34.197 --> 28:37.817
I-I don't know
how or when,

28:37.868 --> 28:39.768
and I don't care where you're living

28:39.786 --> 28:41.654
or-or what dope
you're shacked up with,

28:41.705 --> 28:45.157
you're my girlfriend.

28:45.208 --> 28:47.243
We are endgame.

28:47.277 --> 28:48.744
I know that

28:48.778 --> 28:50.880
and you know that.

28:55.302 --> 28:59.121
We got to go sing our duet, so...

29:00.591 --> 29:02.725
Yeah.

29:09.149 --> 29:11.150
(Kenny Rogers & Sheena Easton's
"We've Got Tonight" begins)

29:24.281 --> 29:28.367
âª I know it's late

29:28.418 --> 29:31.203
âª I know you're weary

29:31.254 --> 29:36.042
âª I know your plans

29:36.093 --> 29:39.378
âª Don't include me

29:39.429 --> 29:43.099
âª Still here we are

29:43.133 --> 29:47.436
âª Both of us lonely

29:47.471 --> 29:51.390
âª Longing for shelter

29:51.441 --> 29:55.611
âª From all that we see

29:55.646 --> 29:59.732
âª Why should we worry?

29:59.783 --> 30:02.785
âª No one will care, girl

30:02.819 --> 30:07.073
RACHEL:
âª Look at the stars, now

30:07.124 --> 30:11.127
âª So far away

30:11.161 --> 30:14.997
âª We've got tonight

30:15.031 --> 30:18.701
âª Who needs tomorrow?

30:18.719 --> 30:22.588
âª We've got tonight, babe

30:22.639 --> 30:26.475
âª Why don't you stay?

30:26.510 --> 30:29.762
âª Deep in my soul

30:29.813 --> 30:33.816
âª I've been so lonely...

30:33.850 --> 30:36.519
I've never slow-danced
with a girl before.

30:36.553 --> 30:38.654
âª All of my hopes
are fading away... âª

30:38.689 --> 30:40.189
I like it.

30:40.223 --> 30:44.944
âª And I've longed for love

30:44.995 --> 30:49.832
âª Like everyone else does

30:49.866 --> 30:53.669
âª I know I'll keep searching

30:53.704 --> 30:57.573
âª After today

30:57.591 --> 31:01.127
âª So there it is, girl

31:01.178 --> 31:04.964
âª We've got it all now

31:05.015 --> 31:08.917
âª And here we are, babe

31:08.935 --> 31:12.471
âª What do you say?

31:12.522 --> 31:15.924
BOTH:
âª We've got tonight

31:15.942 --> 31:20.479
âª Who needs tomorrow?

31:20.530 --> 31:24.033
âª We've got tonight, babe

31:24.067 --> 31:28.103
âª Why don't we stay?

31:29.773 --> 31:31.607
âª I know it's late

31:31.625 --> 31:35.544
âª And I know you're weary

31:37.914 --> 31:42.785
âª I know your plans don't include me âª

31:42.803 --> 31:47.673
âª Still here we are

31:47.724 --> 31:51.510
MARLEY AND JAKE:
âª Both of us lonely

31:51.561 --> 31:57.516
âª Both of us lonely âª

31:57.567 --> 31:59.568
(laughing)

32:00.771 --> 32:04.740
âª We've got tonight

32:04.775 --> 32:08.744
âª Who needs tomorrow?

32:08.779 --> 32:12.698
âª Let's make it last

32:12.749 --> 32:16.619
âª Let's find a way

32:16.653 --> 32:20.372
âª Turn out the light

32:20.423 --> 32:23.876
âª Come take my hand now

32:23.927 --> 32:28.497
RACHEL AND FINN:
âª We've got tonight, babe

32:28.515 --> 32:32.668
âª Why don't we stay?

32:32.686 --> 32:37.606
âª We've got tonight, babe

32:37.641 --> 32:41.393
âª Why don't we

32:41.444 --> 32:43.444
âª Stay...

32:51.321 --> 32:53.572
Tell me now that we're
not back together.

32:53.623 --> 32:55.858
I mean...

32:55.876 --> 32:58.794
It was fun, but...
Don't.

32:58.829 --> 33:00.830
I'm not gonna let you
minimize this, Kurt.

33:00.864 --> 33:02.748
It's no accident that we were together

33:02.799 --> 33:04.967
on Christmas and again
on Valentine's Day.

33:05.001 --> 33:08.036
And we're going to be together
for many, many more,

33:08.054 --> 33:10.205
no matter how much you pretend

33:10.223 --> 33:12.391
that this doesn't mean anything.

33:15.011 --> 33:17.680
I'll see you downstairs.

33:19.716 --> 33:21.433
(door opens)

33:21.484 --> 33:22.685
Okay.

33:22.719 --> 33:24.720
(door closes)

33:26.990 --> 33:28.824
(sighs)

33:34.497 --> 33:37.333
So that's why college girls experiment.

33:37.367 --> 33:38.567
And thank God they do.

33:38.585 --> 33:40.536
You know, it was fun,
and I've always wondered

33:40.570 --> 33:42.321
what it would be like
to be with a woman,

33:42.355 --> 33:43.956
but, uh, I don't know.
I think for me

33:44.007 --> 33:45.291
it was more of a one-time thing.

33:45.342 --> 33:46.625
Look, you don't have to worry.

33:46.676 --> 33:49.712
I'm not going to show up
at your house with a U-Haul.

33:49.746 --> 33:51.747
(laughs)

33:53.383 --> 33:54.633
So what happens next?

33:54.684 --> 33:57.519
Well, you could walk out first.

33:57.554 --> 34:00.723
Or we could make it
a two-time thing?

34:04.361 --> 34:06.312
Was it good for you?

34:06.363 --> 34:08.847
I don't know. You?

34:08.882 --> 34:11.166
No idea.

34:11.201 --> 34:13.202
(both laughing)

34:16.606 --> 34:20.376
(sighs) I'm sorry. Eh, don't be.

34:20.409 --> 34:23.161
But you spent so much money on this room.
No, I didn't.

34:23.213 --> 34:25.164
I just snagged a key card
from the maid's cart

34:25.215 --> 34:26.581
and tried every door till one opened.

34:26.616 --> 34:29.051
Are you serious?
No.

34:29.085 --> 34:31.053
(laughs)

34:31.087 --> 34:33.672
Come on. Can we at least
make it back downstairs

34:33.723 --> 34:36.175
for another dance?

34:36.226 --> 34:38.226
Let's go.

35:05.467 --> 35:07.267
Hello? My God.

35:07.302 --> 35:08.936
This is amazing.

35:08.970 --> 35:11.305
Just a little something
I threw together.

35:11.339 --> 35:13.774
Only took two whole days,
but you're worth it.

35:13.808 --> 35:15.275
Thank you.

35:15.310 --> 35:18.612
I felt bad about us not being together

35:18.646 --> 35:20.814
on Valentine's Day, but since, uh,

35:20.848 --> 35:24.618
Kurt and Santana are out until tomorrow,

35:24.652 --> 35:26.787
I thought we could take advantage.

35:31.326 --> 35:33.193
Did you kiss somebody else
when you were away?

35:33.211 --> 35:36.129
You're kissing differently.
What if I did?

35:36.164 --> 35:38.966
I thought we were in a modern and
open relationship. Yeah, we are.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.001
But, I mean, the key is
that we are honest

35:41.035 --> 35:42.636
with each other
with everything that we do.

35:42.670 --> 35:44.805
So, did you see Finn?

35:44.839 --> 35:46.673
Finn's fine.
He lives in Ohio.

35:46.707 --> 35:48.708
And I live here with you.

35:48.726 --> 35:50.710
Cool?

35:50.728 --> 35:52.679
Like a cucumber.
(laughs)

35:52.713 --> 35:55.098
Thank you for being honest with me.

35:56.684 --> 35:59.019
Well, speaking of being
honest, what about you, huh?

35:59.053 --> 36:01.388
Mm-hmm. Who did you see?
Who did you do?

36:01.406 --> 36:02.823
Sure there are a lot lonely girls

36:02.857 --> 36:04.191
in New York City on Valentine's Day.

36:04.225 --> 36:08.629
I stayed at home and watched
weightlifting videos.

36:15.403 --> 36:17.571
Well, thank you for
being honest with me.

36:19.374 --> 36:21.741
Care to join me in the bedroom?

36:21.759 --> 36:23.544
(sighs)

36:23.578 --> 36:25.345
Is it okay if I pass tonight?

36:25.380 --> 36:26.913
I have airplane belly.

36:26.931 --> 36:28.915
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course.

36:28.933 --> 36:31.869
I am kind of worn out
from the night before you left.

36:31.903 --> 36:34.571
Okay, so, couch time and... Yes!

36:34.622 --> 36:36.189
...I will get
some popcorn.

36:38.159 --> 36:40.377
I'm glad to have you back.

36:40.411 --> 36:41.528
I genuinely missed you.

36:48.636 --> 36:50.804
(school bell ringing) Before
you say anything, I'm sorry.

36:50.838 --> 36:52.973
I'm sorry that I attacked
you at the reception.

36:53.007 --> 36:55.392
It's just, I saw you up
there, singing with Blaine,

36:55.426 --> 36:57.728
and I saw the old, legendary chemistry.

36:57.762 --> 36:59.846
I saw two soul mates
rediscovering each other,

36:59.880 --> 37:01.765
and I was jealous.

37:01.816 --> 37:03.600
Why couldn't that be me?

37:03.651 --> 37:05.152
Why can't I have that with someone?

37:05.186 --> 37:06.570
You will, just not with me.

37:06.604 --> 37:08.572
I'm sorry that I've been
throwing myself at you,

37:08.606 --> 37:10.274
making a fool of myself,

37:10.325 --> 37:12.409
hoping for something
I know can never be.

37:12.443 --> 37:13.694
It's okay, Tina.
The truth is,

37:13.728 --> 37:15.078
we've all experienced
unrequited love before,

37:15.113 --> 37:16.947
and we've all done things that we wish

37:16.998 --> 37:19.583
we didn't, and we all just want
to get back to being friends.

37:19.617 --> 37:22.169
And that's just what we are.
I mean, we're just friends.

37:22.203 --> 37:24.037
Um, well, we're going
to the double feature

37:24.071 --> 37:25.589
of <i>All About Eve</i> and <i>Showgirls</i>
at the revival house

37:25.623 --> 37:26.957
if you want to come with us.
Wow.

37:27.008 --> 37:28.592
Mystery solved, Hagatha Christie.

37:28.626 --> 37:30.877
I'm gonna be a third wheel
for the rest of my life.

37:30.911 --> 37:33.046
First of all, that's
not even remotely true.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.382
Starting right now, I'm gonna
help you get a boyfriend.

37:35.416 --> 37:37.351
And second of all,
when I called you a hag,

37:37.385 --> 37:39.219
I was bringing attention to the fact

37:39.253 --> 37:41.521
that you are honoring the noble
and proud tradition of hagdom.

37:41.556 --> 37:43.273
Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, and
I, for one, am psyched

37:43.308 --> 37:45.525
that my very first hag was
someone as kick-ass as...

37:45.560 --> 37:48.145
BLAINE AND KURT:
Ms. Tina Cohen-Chang.

37:48.196 --> 37:49.813
(Tina laughs)

37:49.864 --> 37:51.615
(school bell ringing) Hey.

37:51.649 --> 37:53.984
Sorry I didn't get to
see you after the party.

37:54.035 --> 37:56.036
I wanted to say thank you.
Uh, for what?

37:56.070 --> 37:58.789
Come on. Jake is awesome
and everything, but he's not

37:58.823 --> 38:01.041
capable of that.
Any of it.

38:01.075 --> 38:05.212
I know it was you whispering
in his ear like Cyrano.

38:05.246 --> 38:06.330
Like who?

38:06.381 --> 38:07.965
Anyway, it was sweet.

38:07.999 --> 38:09.666
And romantic.

38:09.717 --> 38:11.969
And whenever you do that
for someone for real,

38:12.003 --> 38:14.788
she's going to be the
luckiest girl on the planet.

38:15.840 --> 38:18.008
It was for real.

38:23.348 --> 38:24.648
I'm sorry.

38:24.682 --> 38:26.350
I should probably go.

38:26.401 --> 38:28.402
Yeah.

38:42.321 --> 38:43.688
(school bell ringing)

38:45.691 --> 38:49.310
Uh, that was a fresh cup.
Clearly it's not working.

38:49.328 --> 38:51.163
You're sitting there
looking half-asleep.

38:51.197 --> 38:53.147
What has gotten into you, Finn?
Everything.

38:53.166 --> 38:55.483
The whole situation... it sucks,
and it's time to fix it.

38:55.501 --> 38:57.702
No one ever felt

38:57.753 --> 39:00.172
better sitting around, moping,
feeling sorry for themselves.

39:00.206 --> 39:03.041
That's what Glee Club, and you,
have taught me over the years.

39:03.092 --> 39:05.994
Never shy away from a challenge,
never back down.

39:06.012 --> 39:08.496
And-and no matter what,
do not give up.

39:08.514 --> 39:10.682
I am not giving up. I...

39:10.716 --> 39:12.834
I just need time to process.

39:12.852 --> 39:15.887
Look, there's no time
to process, Mr. Shue.

39:15.938 --> 39:17.272
Somewhere out there right now

39:17.306 --> 39:19.107
there's a <i>Miss</i> Pillsbury running around

39:19.141 --> 39:20.809
who should already
be a <i>Mrs. Schuester.</i>

39:21.861 --> 39:24.196
Emma needs her husband,

39:24.230 --> 39:27.399
and the New Directions!
Need both of their coaches.

39:27.450 --> 39:29.284
I'll be right by your side.

39:29.318 --> 39:31.185
I'm your best man.

39:31.204 --> 39:33.688
We're going to go
and win nationals again...

39:33.706 --> 39:34.739
together.

39:34.790 --> 39:36.841
And together,
we're gonna find your wife.

39:36.876 --> 39:38.877
And we're gonna make things right.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.881
Okay.

39:45.334 --> 39:47.335
Thank you.

39:49.055 --> 39:51.556
(school bell ringing)

39:53.893 --> 39:55.877
Surprised to see me?
No.

39:55.895 --> 39:57.896
I saw you two minutes ago. You
took forever wheeling up here.

39:57.930 --> 40:00.098
Before I went home,
I wanted to apologize

40:00.149 --> 40:02.317
for being so bitchy at the wedding.

40:02.351 --> 40:05.219
When I get nervous, I get kind of mean.

40:05.238 --> 40:06.905
<i>Kind of</i> mean?
You were like <i>Idi Amin</i> mean.

40:06.939 --> 40:08.556
I know, I'm working on that.

40:08.574 --> 40:10.558
Anyway, thanks for putting up with me.

40:10.576 --> 40:12.110
And thanks for...

40:12.161 --> 40:14.395
You're, like, the best I've ever had.

40:14.413 --> 40:15.947
And I've had a lot.

40:15.998 --> 40:17.332
Oh, me, too.

40:17.366 --> 40:19.567
I mean, my sexual prowess is legendary

40:19.585 --> 40:20.919
throughout the Great Lake states.

40:20.953 --> 40:22.787
(both laugh)

40:22.838 --> 40:25.290
Give me your digits, woman.

40:25.341 --> 40:27.792
Why? 'Cause this Saturday
I'm taking you out.

40:27.843 --> 40:31.796
Like on a date?
Yes, definitely a date.

40:31.847 --> 40:33.414
We'll grab some dinner,
maybe see a movie...

40:33.432 --> 40:36.101
Or we could just skip the
dinner and movie, and...

40:36.135 --> 40:39.304
Charter a private jet, fly to Paris,

40:39.355 --> 40:41.940
dance under the Arc de Triomphe
in the Champs-ElysÃ©es?

40:41.974 --> 40:43.942
Yo, when you're rolling
with Artie Abrams,

40:43.976 --> 40:45.477
anything can happen.

40:45.528 --> 40:47.145
(Ellie Goulding's
"Anything Could Happen" begins)

40:47.196 --> 40:52.817
âª Stripped to the waist,
we fall into the river âª

40:56.622 --> 41:01.793
âª Cover your eyes
so you don't know the secret âª

41:03.796 --> 41:05.997
âª Yeah, since we found out

41:06.048 --> 41:09.134
âª Since we found out

41:09.168 --> 41:11.452
âª That anything could happen

41:11.470 --> 41:15.123
âª Anything could happen,
anything could âª

41:15.141 --> 41:17.509
âª <i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh</i> âª

41:17.560 --> 41:19.627
âª <i>Ooh, ooh,</i>
<i>ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh</i> âª

41:19.645 --> 41:21.813
âª <i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh</i> âª

41:21.847 --> 41:24.182
âª <i>Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh,</i>
<i>ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh</i> âª

41:24.233 --> 41:29.321
âª After the war
we said we'd fight together âª

41:29.355 --> 41:34.826
âª <i>Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh,</i>
<i>ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh</i> âª

41:34.860 --> 41:39.147
âª I guess we thought
that's just what humans do âª

41:39.165 --> 41:41.983
âª <i>Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh</i> âª

41:42.001 --> 41:44.035
âª But now I've seen it through

41:44.086 --> 41:46.654
âª And now I know the truth

41:46.689 --> 41:49.157
âª That anything could happen

41:49.175 --> 41:52.210
âª Anything could happen,
anything could âª

41:52.261 --> 41:55.163
âª <i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh</i> âª

41:55.181 --> 41:56.898
âª <i>Ooh, ooh,</i>
<i>ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh</i> âª

41:56.932 --> 41:59.517
âª <i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh</i> âª

41:59.552 --> 42:01.553
âª <i>Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh,</i>
<i>ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh</i> âª

42:01.604 --> 42:04.172
âª Baby

42:04.190 --> 42:08.893
âª I'll give you everything you need âª

42:08.944 --> 42:13.347
âª I'll give you
everything you need, oh âª

42:13.366 --> 42:16.517
âª But I don't think I need you

42:16.535 --> 42:21.239
âª Stripped to the waist,
we fall into the river âª

42:21.290 --> 42:23.357
âª <i>Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh</i> âª

42:23.376 --> 42:25.193
âª Yeah, since we found out

42:25.211 --> 42:27.862
âª Since we found out

42:27.880 --> 42:30.248
âª That anything could happen

42:30.299 --> 42:34.052
âª Anything could happen,
anything could âª

42:34.086 --> 42:35.920
âª I know it's gonna be

42:35.971 --> 42:38.039
âª I know it's gonna be âª

42:38.057 --> 42:40.892
âª I know it's gonna be

42:40.926 --> 42:43.211
âª I know it's gonna be âª

42:43.229 --> 42:45.213
âª I know it's gonna be

42:45.231 --> 42:47.215
âª I know it's gonna be âª

42:47.233 --> 42:50.218
âª All right
âª <i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh</i> âª

42:50.236 --> 42:52.720
âª Ooh, oh, yeah, oh, yeah âª
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh</i> âª

42:52.738 --> 42:54.439
âª Oh, yeah, ooh-ooh âª <i>Ooh,
ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh</i> âª

42:54.490 --> 42:57.225
âª But I don't think I need you

42:57.243 --> 42:59.794
âª <i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh</i> âª

42:59.829 --> 43:01.913
âª <i>Ooh, ooh,</i>
<i>ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh</i> âª

43:01.947 --> 43:05.733
âª <i>Ooh, ooh, ooh,</i>
<i>ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh</i> âª

43:05.751 --> 43:08.236
âª Anything could happen.
