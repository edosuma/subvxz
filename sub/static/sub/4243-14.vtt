WEBVTT

00:04.468 --> 00:06.469
Thanks for coming to meet me.

00:08.189 --> 00:10.473
I half-thought that Brody guy
was gonna be with you, and

00:10.508 --> 00:11.591
I didn't think you'd want to

00:11.625 --> 00:13.259
spend your first Valentine's Day apart.

00:13.294 --> 00:15.094
Yeah, it's actually a little bit
of a point of contention

00:15.129 --> 00:16.629
between the two of us.

00:16.664 --> 00:18.114
He was... I don't know,
weirded out,

00:18.148 --> 00:19.332
about going to a stranger's wedding,

00:19.366 --> 00:20.867
and so I... Okay.
Okay, cool, cool.

00:20.918 --> 00:22.452
So I-I don't really need to hear
about your new boyfriend

00:22.486 --> 00:24.370
that you're living with, all right?

00:26.156 --> 00:27.440
Finn, what's going on right now?

00:27.474 --> 00:29.175
You look like you
slept in those clothes.

00:29.210 --> 00:30.960
And you won't even look at me.

00:30.994 --> 00:32.595
I kissed Miss Pillsbury.

00:34.348 --> 00:35.465
Did she kiss you back?

00:35.499 --> 00:37.016
No, she was totally freaked out by it.

00:37.051 --> 00:38.468
I don't even know how it happened.

00:38.502 --> 00:39.669
We've been spending all this time

00:39.687 --> 00:41.387
together, and then...

00:41.438 --> 00:44.340
she was there, and I just
felt the need to...

00:45.509 --> 00:46.809
And I kissed her, and I...

00:46.843 --> 00:48.194
Does Mr. Shue know?

00:48.229 --> 00:49.395
I don't... I don't think so.

00:49.446 --> 00:51.314
I don't think she'd tell him, but...

00:51.348 --> 00:52.198
maybe I should.
No.

00:52.233 --> 00:54.150
Don't. Just... don't.

00:54.184 --> 00:55.068
Okay?

00:55.119 --> 00:56.319
Remember how you felt about Puck

00:56.353 --> 00:57.520
when you found out about him and Quinn?

00:57.538 --> 00:58.655
You kicked a garbage can.

00:58.689 --> 01:00.490
I'm the worst person in the world!

01:00.524 --> 01:01.574
No, you're not.

01:01.625 --> 01:03.326
What you did, it wasn't

01:03.360 --> 01:04.694
great, but I get it.

01:04.712 --> 01:07.046
You're confused,
and... and lonely.

01:07.081 --> 01:08.998
I'm sure that...

01:09.032 --> 01:10.700
just knowing about Brody
and I living together,

01:10.718 --> 01:12.001
it-it set you off.

01:12.035 --> 01:14.053
Not everything has to do with you.

01:20.394 --> 01:21.928
Look, I don't know what to do.

01:23.230 --> 01:24.597
You always wanted to be an actor, right?

01:24.648 --> 01:25.765
So here's your chance to play the role

01:25.816 --> 01:26.933
of the supportive best man.

01:39.613 --> 01:40.830
(school bell ringing)

01:42.065 --> 01:43.750
Um...

01:45.569 --> 01:46.836
Oh, God...

01:49.573 --> 01:51.758
I'd feel a lot more comfortable

01:51.792 --> 01:53.593
if this door stayed open.
The whole wall

01:53.627 --> 01:55.712
is glass, and there's like
50 kids walking by.

01:55.746 --> 01:57.079
I don't have time for this, Finn.

01:57.097 --> 01:58.381
Seriously, this seating chart

01:58.415 --> 01:59.766
is like a giant sudoku.

01:59.800 --> 02:00.883
Will wants his mother
as far away from the bar

02:00.917 --> 02:02.101
as possible, and all of you Glee kids

02:02.136 --> 02:03.770
have dated so incestuously that I can't

02:03.804 --> 02:05.221
even remember who can tolerate
who anymore, so...

02:05.255 --> 02:07.223
Look, I'm-I'm worried
about not being able

02:07.257 --> 02:09.892
to do this. Being able to look
Mr. Shue in the eyes. I...

02:09.925 --> 02:11.561
Look, I'm really sorry

02:11.595 --> 02:13.229
that I don't have a pamphlet
handy for you right now,

02:13.263 --> 02:15.231
but I'm pretty sure if I did,
it would say something like,

02:15.265 --> 02:17.784
"Get Over It," okay?

02:17.818 --> 02:19.452
My therapist says that I use my OCD

02:19.486 --> 02:21.904
to control the uncontrollable.
Ever since I was

02:21.938 --> 02:24.073
a little kid, I would plan
and plan and plan all

02:24.107 --> 02:25.458
my birthday parties
but never actually went through

02:25.492 --> 02:26.909
with any of them
because they were never ready

02:26.943 --> 02:28.995
by the time my birthday
actually rolled around.

02:29.046 --> 02:31.581
I just wanted to help you. Look,
when I get on that altar,

02:31.615 --> 02:33.299
and I make my solemn vows for the second

02:33.334 --> 02:35.585
and, I hope, the very last time,

02:35.619 --> 02:38.120
standing right behind my husband
will be his best man.

02:38.138 --> 02:41.140
That's you... the guy who thought
it was okay to kiss me

02:41.175 --> 02:42.308
a week before my wedding.

02:42.343 --> 02:43.593
The guy who is forcing me

02:43.627 --> 02:44.927
to lie to my fiancé.

02:44.961 --> 02:47.180
And if you really want to help me,

02:47.231 --> 02:51.100
then just keep a wide berth
and keep your mouth shut.

02:51.134 --> 02:53.436
How's my nervous

02:53.470 --> 02:54.771
little bride doing?

02:54.805 --> 02:56.189
Um, good, I just, I just

02:56.240 --> 02:57.490
really could use some
help with this seating...

02:57.524 --> 02:59.025
Right after Glee practice, I promise.

03:01.695 --> 03:03.496
Okay.

03:03.530 --> 03:05.531
Come on, Finn.

03:06.650 --> 03:09.952
Okay.

03:09.986 --> 03:11.788
(school bell ringing) Glee Club!

03:11.822 --> 03:14.290
(applause, cheering,
whistling and chatter)

03:14.324 --> 03:15.958
Mr. Shue, how was D.C.?

03:15.992 --> 03:19.212
D.C. was great,
but now I am back to stay.

03:19.263 --> 03:21.297
Holla! And so, for my
first order of business,

03:21.331 --> 03:24.183
I want to give a big shout-out
to the guy who made sure

03:24.218 --> 03:27.002
I had something to come back
to... Mr. Finn Hudson.

03:27.021 --> 03:29.022
(cheering and applause)

03:29.056 --> 03:32.392
Now... for this week's
assignment...

03:32.443 --> 03:33.526
I hope it's Britney again.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.528
ALL:
Oh!

03:35.562 --> 03:37.530
Ha, ha, ha!

03:37.564 --> 03:40.733
Miss Pillsbury and I are finally
getting married.

03:40.784 --> 03:42.035
Yeah!
Which makes me the happiest,

03:42.069 --> 03:43.403
luckiest man alive.

03:43.454 --> 03:45.238
Now, Emma has been
handling all the prep,

03:45.289 --> 03:47.156
so to help out,
I thought I'd take charge

03:47.190 --> 03:48.741
of the entertainment for the reception.

03:48.792 --> 03:50.410
And though this goes against tradition,

03:50.461 --> 03:52.745
it would mean the world
to me and to Emma

03:52.796 --> 03:55.331
if, instead of giving your
best man's speech, Finn,

03:55.365 --> 03:56.966
you sing for us.

03:58.435 --> 03:59.502
What do you think?

03:59.536 --> 04:03.506
Uh... uh, yeah, of course.

04:03.540 --> 04:04.874
Perfect.
(laughs)

04:04.892 --> 04:07.009
For everyone else who isn't
out with Asian bird flu...

04:07.043 --> 04:08.244
It wasn't me.

04:08.278 --> 04:09.679
...it's a Valentine's
Day wedding, which means,

04:09.713 --> 04:10.847
we need some great romantic

04:10.881 --> 04:12.098
love songs at the reception.

04:12.149 --> 04:14.267
Wait. You want <i>us</i>
to be your wedding singers?

04:14.318 --> 04:16.017
That is so...
Awesome.

04:16.052 --> 04:17.185
We'd be honored.

04:17.220 --> 04:19.053
Great. I have
some great ideas.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.575
(school bell ringing) Oh.

04:22.609 --> 04:24.077
So, her name is Betty.

04:24.111 --> 04:25.695
She's gonna be sitting next to you.

04:25.729 --> 04:29.082
She's my niece, she's blonde,
she's an amazing singer,

04:29.116 --> 04:32.201
and she has...
um, very large, uh...

04:32.235 --> 04:33.119
Feet?

04:33.170 --> 04:34.036
Boobies.

04:34.070 --> 04:35.538
Oh. Oh, my.

04:35.572 --> 04:37.072
(laughs, clears throat)

04:37.091 --> 04:38.374
Uh, Miss Pillsbury,

04:38.408 --> 04:39.926
are you okay?
What, me? Yeah, I'm fine.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.094
Your locker's not, though.

04:41.128 --> 04:42.261
It's flu season.

04:42.296 --> 04:43.629
I can practically see the virus

04:43.680 --> 04:45.047
growing in here.

04:45.081 --> 04:47.266
I'm sorry. It's just
a little bit

04:47.301 --> 04:49.135
of residual wedding stress.

04:49.186 --> 04:51.053
Nothing that any bride wouldn't feel

04:51.087 --> 04:52.054
this close to her big day, though.

04:52.088 --> 04:52.855
Right?

04:54.925 --> 04:59.929
So, I know it's not
Valentine's Day yet, but

04:59.947 --> 05:02.949
I wanted you to open this now.

05:06.370 --> 05:08.821
They're cuff links.

05:08.872 --> 05:10.339
I made it myself from
this old typewriter

05:10.374 --> 05:12.074
my mom and I found at a garage sale.

05:12.108 --> 05:13.910
I just wanted you to have them early

05:13.944 --> 05:15.962
so you could wear them
to Mr. Shue's wedding.

05:15.996 --> 05:18.831
These are so cool, but I can't
wait to give you your gift.

05:18.882 --> 05:20.299
You're gonna love it.

05:20.334 --> 05:21.918
I love it already,
I don't care what it is.

05:21.952 --> 05:24.003
I'll meet you after Spanish class, okay?

05:28.625 --> 05:30.977
Dude, you did get her something, right?

05:31.011 --> 05:34.013
Not yet, but I've got some ideas.

05:34.064 --> 05:36.098
I've been brainstorming with my brother.

05:36.132 --> 05:38.267
You said she has some kind
of eating disorder thing, right?

05:38.301 --> 05:40.520
Yeah. Take her out to dinner.
Save a bunch of cash.

05:40.571 --> 05:41.988
Then you can use that extra money

05:42.022 --> 05:43.489
to buy a ton of different lingerie.

05:43.524 --> 05:46.692
Have her put on a fashion show.
Chicks love fashion.

05:46.743 --> 05:48.611
Dude, I know you're, like,
related to that guy,

05:48.645 --> 05:50.980
but he's kind of creepy and
currently dating a sophomore.

05:50.998 --> 05:53.282
All right, I'm not
letting you do any of that.

05:53.316 --> 05:54.784
Dude, I don't know about this stuff.

05:54.818 --> 05:56.819
Okay, those are the
only ideas that I had.

05:56.837 --> 05:58.454
You want to do something romantic.

05:58.488 --> 06:00.790
Something she's gonna remember
for the rest of her life.

06:00.824 --> 06:03.292
Well, it's not like I can afford
diamond earrings or a Bentley.

06:03.326 --> 06:04.961
It's not how much money you put into it.

06:04.995 --> 06:07.547
It's about how much of <i>you</i>
you put it into it.

06:07.598 --> 06:08.831
Well, you got some ideas?

06:08.849 --> 06:11.000
A bunch, which is why
you're going to forget

06:11.018 --> 06:15.154
about Valentine's <i>Day</i>
and make it Valentine's <i>Week.</i>

06:15.189 --> 06:17.139
Genius.
Mm-hmm.

06:17.173 --> 06:19.141
Thank you. Say hi to
Mrs. Sanchez for me.

06:19.175 --> 06:21.143
Okay. (Sighs)

06:21.177 --> 06:23.178
(school bell ringing)

06:26.900 --> 06:29.151
Where have you been? I asked
you to come, like, an hour ago.

06:29.185 --> 06:30.820
I was getting a spray-tan.
Mr. Shue asked me

06:30.854 --> 06:32.655
to sing him a song as my best man toast.

06:32.689 --> 06:35.157
So far, I've narrowed it down
to "Confessions" by Usher,

06:35.191 --> 06:38.995
"My Best Friend's Girl," and
"Lyin' Eyes" by the Eagles.

06:39.029 --> 06:40.997
I can't... I can't go through with this.
You're gonna

06:41.031 --> 06:42.665
be fine, all right? I'll sing
with you. We can do a duet.

06:42.699 --> 06:44.333
I'll take the lead, and you can just

06:44.367 --> 06:45.668
sway in the background.

06:45.702 --> 06:48.588
Right. Well, I think
the real issue here is,

06:48.639 --> 06:50.756
whether or not
you can handle singing with me.

06:50.807 --> 06:53.509
I mean, we do have some pretty
dangerous musical chemistry.

06:53.543 --> 06:56.345
I think I can control myself.

06:56.379 --> 06:59.599
Although, I will admit,
you do look very cute right now.

07:01.652 --> 07:03.636
I've been dieting.

07:07.557 --> 07:09.108
I'll pick out a song.
(clears throat)

07:09.159 --> 07:11.027
(school bell ringing)

07:11.061 --> 07:13.195
WILL: So eagles sit at the
top of the food chain.

07:13.229 --> 07:14.447
Their lifting power
is about four pounds.

07:14.498 --> 07:16.365
It's like a small baby.

07:16.399 --> 07:18.200
Okay, what is going on with you?

07:18.234 --> 07:20.202
Did you buy more of those
11-hour energy shots?

07:20.236 --> 07:21.921
Because there's a reason
they're illegal in Canada.

07:21.955 --> 07:23.756
Nothing's going on.
What could be going on?

07:23.790 --> 07:26.241
It's history class.

07:27.294 --> 07:29.211
(whispering) All right.

07:29.245 --> 07:31.097
WILL: Jacob, you've
got the floor.

07:31.131 --> 07:32.431
Hello. This is kind of
embarrassing,

07:32.466 --> 07:34.300
but...
Jake, what are you doing?!

07:34.351 --> 07:35.635
Are you really standing up

07:35.686 --> 07:36.552
in front of everyone

07:36.586 --> 07:37.637
and singing to prove your love

07:37.688 --> 07:38.638
for Marley?

07:38.689 --> 07:40.723
Yes, Ryder. Yes, I am. Wow.

07:40.757 --> 07:42.708
That's so crazy and
emotionally vulnerable.

07:42.743 --> 07:44.126
I had no idea.

07:44.161 --> 07:45.328
Oh, wait.

07:45.362 --> 07:47.880
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.

07:47.914 --> 07:49.882
Marley, I know this is one
of your favorite songs,

07:49.916 --> 07:51.384
so this is for you.

You like it?
Oh, my God.

10:14.895 --> 10:15.694
(indistinct chatter)

10:15.729 --> 10:16.862
She liked it.

10:16.897 --> 10:18.397
MARLEY:
That was so romantic.

10:18.448 --> 10:20.449
(indistinct chatter)

10:26.494 --> 10:27.711
(sighs)

10:27.745 --> 10:29.580
It is a Carrot Top convention.

10:35.003 --> 10:37.387
I am so over this,
and it hasn't even started yet.

10:37.422 --> 10:39.339
I'm clearly the hottest bitch
in this lousy joint,

10:39.390 --> 10:41.308
but I'm all alone,
stuck here sitting with you.

10:41.342 --> 10:42.976
Do you want me to slap you again?

10:43.011 --> 10:45.729
I hate weddings,
and I hate Valentine's Day.

10:45.763 --> 10:47.981
They were invented by breeders
to sell cheap chocolate

10:48.016 --> 10:49.266
and false hope.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.767
Do you know what <i>I</i> hate?

10:50.801 --> 10:52.152
Men. Every single

10:52.187 --> 10:55.489
one of them is a pig, except
maybe Mr. Shue and Al Roker.

10:55.523 --> 10:57.157
And you know what?
You were right.

10:57.192 --> 10:59.326
I do let men define me, but not anymore.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.528
Like Gloria Steinem said,
"A woman without a man

11:01.579 --> 11:03.330
is like a fish
without a bicycle."

11:03.364 --> 11:06.283
Al Roker is disgusting, by the way.

11:06.317 --> 11:08.435
(scoffs) Whatever.

11:18.329 --> 11:20.697
Hi. Betty?

11:20.731 --> 11:22.366
Yes? Oh, God.

11:22.400 --> 11:25.586
What? Did I beat you to
the last handicap spot? Sorry.

11:25.620 --> 11:28.205
I'm Artie. Miss Pillsbury said I
should look out for you? (Groans)

11:28.239 --> 11:29.706
Hell, no.
Uh...

11:29.740 --> 11:31.708
No.
Uh...

11:31.742 --> 11:36.096
No. Wheel away. Wheel...
the hell... away.

11:36.130 --> 11:38.882
My aunt told me she was fixing
me up with someone good-looking,

11:38.916 --> 11:41.301
so that was a lie.

11:41.352 --> 11:44.638
Oh. I mean, some people think
I'm kind of nerdy-hot, so...

11:44.689 --> 11:45.639
No, no, no.

11:45.690 --> 11:47.641
Andrew Garfield
is nerdy-hot.

11:47.692 --> 11:50.060
You are Stephen Hawking's
younger brother.

11:50.094 --> 11:52.262
Miss Pillsbury didn't tell you
I was in a wheelchair, did she?

11:52.280 --> 11:55.232
Um, obviously not, because
I don't date losers in chairs.

11:55.266 --> 11:57.234
But you're in a wheelchair.
Yeah,

11:57.268 --> 12:00.437
I'm also blonde, captain of the
cheerleaders at my high school,

12:00.455 --> 12:02.706
and I've got this going on.

12:04.609 --> 12:06.410
JAKE:
<i>You first.</i>

12:06.444 --> 12:08.078
Thank you, sir.
Yep.

12:08.112 --> 12:10.998
Oh, my gosh, Jake.
Are these for me?

12:11.049 --> 12:13.000
Yes?

12:13.051 --> 12:14.451
How did you know I love peonies?

12:14.469 --> 12:16.253
They're the queen of flowers.

12:16.287 --> 12:18.922
RYDER: Because you mentioned
it in the choir room once,

12:18.956 --> 12:20.957
and Jake remembered.
Right, dude?

12:20.975 --> 12:24.127
Right. Yeah.
I love them.

12:24.145 --> 12:26.146
And you.

12:28.966 --> 12:30.967
(whispering):
Thank you.

12:34.805 --> 12:36.273
(moaning)

12:36.307 --> 12:38.442
Had I known I was gonna get
groped in the back of a Prius,

12:38.476 --> 12:39.976
I would've brought a change of clothes.

12:39.994 --> 12:42.479
I'm gonna go in there looking
like <i>Prom: The Morning After.</i>

12:42.497 --> 12:43.947
(moaning) What am I doing?

12:43.981 --> 12:45.449
I'm sort of dating somebody in New York.

12:45.483 --> 12:47.868
Uh, you're not in New York.
And it's not exclusive, right?

12:47.919 --> 12:51.538
You in this fey boy-tie...
it's my Kryptonite.

12:51.589 --> 12:53.790
(moaning) Wait, this doesn't mean
that we're back together, right?

12:53.824 --> 12:56.326
No, no, no. It's-it's cool.
I know, I know. It's-it's...

12:56.344 --> 12:59.379
This is just bros helping bros.
I love it when you talk fratty.

12:59.430 --> 13:01.632
(moaning)

13:01.666 --> 13:02.999
Tell me that's not Tina again!

13:03.017 --> 13:05.469
Hey, can you two wrap
it up? The wedding is

13:05.503 --> 13:07.971
about to start,
and I need my arm-gays.

13:08.005 --> 13:11.007
(shuddering) Oh, my God.

13:13.528 --> 13:16.813
You do realize how trashy
blasphemous this is, right?

13:16.847 --> 13:19.366
Mercedes, everyone hooks
up at weddings. Mm-hmm.

13:19.400 --> 13:23.353
Let's go. This outfit needs an audience.
(church bells ringing)

13:26.357 --> 13:28.024
(door opens)

13:31.879 --> 13:33.863
Oh, my God.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.832
What are you wearing?
What?

13:35.866 --> 13:38.034
This old thing? Why,
it's an exact replica

13:38.052 --> 13:39.336
of your wedding dress.

13:39.370 --> 13:40.504
Why would you do that?

13:40.538 --> 13:42.222
To get back at Will
Schuester for handing

13:42.256 --> 13:44.691
a teaching position to
a flabby 19-year-old.

13:46.744 --> 13:48.195
(Emma hyperventilating)

13:48.246 --> 13:51.531
Um... Sue, I feel really scared.

13:51.582 --> 13:53.000
I feel really overwhelmed.

13:53.034 --> 13:54.167
I feel like I can't

13:54.202 --> 13:56.119
think straight. I'm just
really, really worried

13:56.153 --> 13:57.337
that this isn't gonna work.

13:57.372 --> 13:58.755
Well, of course it isn't going to work.

13:58.790 --> 14:00.957
You're a weird bird-lady
with a hollow pelvis

14:00.991 --> 14:03.043
and OCD, and Will Schuester

14:03.094 --> 14:05.295
is a weepy man-child
whose greatest joy in life

14:05.329 --> 14:07.347
is singing with children
and whose best friend

14:07.382 --> 14:08.632
is 19. It's just, the last time

14:08.666 --> 14:10.517
was such a disaster.
You know, I-I turned

14:10.551 --> 14:12.185
into somebody
that I didn't even recognize.

14:12.220 --> 14:14.221
If I'm wrong again,

14:14.272 --> 14:16.023
I won't survive.
Well,

14:16.057 --> 14:17.357
don't say that to Will Schuester.

14:17.392 --> 14:18.358
He'll have you singing

14:18.393 --> 14:19.860
a stripped-down acoustic version

14:19.894 --> 14:22.145
of "I Will Survive" in front of
a choir room full of teenagers

14:22.179 --> 14:23.814
with meaningful looks on their faces.

14:23.848 --> 14:24.981
God, I can't breathe.

14:25.015 --> 14:26.366
I can't breathe.

14:26.401 --> 14:27.818
I don't feel like there's
any air in here.

Hey, what do you think?

17:36.090 --> 17:37.891
Nice, huh?

17:37.925 --> 17:39.259
Thank you for coming.

17:41.145 --> 17:42.646
(mouthing)

17:46.684 --> 17:49.102
Sue. What are you doing?

17:49.153 --> 17:52.772
(quietly): I'm trying to
stop this from becoming

17:52.823 --> 17:54.824
an utter fiasco.

17:57.612 --> 18:00.163
Emma's left the building.

18:00.197 --> 18:03.116
(church bell ringing)

18:10.367 --> 18:13.461
So, did she give you any idea
why she might do this?

18:13.479 --> 18:16.064
I mean, like, leading up
to today, did she...

18:16.098 --> 18:19.300
tell you anything or... She
didn't have to tell me anything.

18:19.318 --> 18:21.186
I left her with all this...

18:21.237 --> 18:23.805
stress and planning.
She was losing it and

18:23.823 --> 18:27.025
I kept telling her that it was
her usual obsessiveness. I...

18:27.076 --> 18:28.610
Yeah, but she left you
at the altar, man.

18:28.644 --> 18:30.195
I mean, that's pretty hard-core.

18:30.246 --> 18:32.213
(sighs)

18:32.248 --> 18:34.082

(footsteps approaching) (cough)

18:42.758 --> 18:44.709

to come here and ask

18:44.760 --> 18:46.044
what you would like
to do, Mr. Shue.

18:46.095 --> 18:47.161
About what?

18:47.179 --> 18:48.329
Uh, about the reception.

18:48.364 --> 18:49.664
Miss Pillsbury's parents say

18:49.682 --> 18:51.549
they paid for the whole thing, so...

18:51.600 --> 18:53.468
we might as well go ahead
and have the party and...

18:53.502 --> 18:55.387
if you ask me, they seem pretty
happy about what happened.

18:55.438 --> 18:58.172
We can't have a reception now.
Sure you can.

18:58.190 --> 19:00.225
All of you came back,
you should be together.

19:00.276 --> 19:02.677
Just because I ruined my Valentine's Day

19:02.695 --> 19:04.846
doesn't mean I have
to ruin all of yours, too.

Sorry, ladies,
can I see some I.D.?

I'm 25. Name's Rosario Cruz.

19:44.153 --> 19:45.553
I might be related to Penelope.

19:45.571 --> 19:47.439
You? Emily Stark. Barely legal.

19:47.490 --> 19:50.658
Well, that's good, 'cause I hear
your professors are into that.

19:50.693 --> 19:52.610
You know, we always were two ends

19:52.661 --> 19:54.662
of the same bitch-goddess
spectrum.

19:54.697 --> 19:56.531
Maybe that's why we love
each other so much.

19:56.565 --> 19:58.533
And slap each other.

19:58.567 --> 20:00.785

Do you think maybe just one of
these gifts should be your idea?

20:36.772 --> 20:38.990
No, my ideas suck. I mean,
I tried to write her a poem,

20:39.041 --> 20:40.775
and the only words
that I could come up with

20:40.793 --> 20:44.779
to rhyme with Marley
was "barley" and "gnarly."

20:44.797 --> 20:48.750

from the jeweler at the mall.

20:48.784 --> 20:50.668
It's pretty but it's not too expensive,

20:50.719 --> 20:52.620
so she won't think you stole it.

20:52.638 --> 20:55.507

28:31.261 --> 28:33.112
You and I both know how this thing ends.

28:34.197 --> 28:37.817
I-I don't know
how or when,

28:37.868 --> 28:39.768
and I don't care where you're living

28:39.786 --> 28:41.654
or-or what dope
you're shacked up with,

28:41.705 --> 28:45.157

Yeah.

32:55.876 --> 32:58.794
It was fun, but...
Don't.

32:58.829 --> 33:00.830
I'm not gonna let you
minimize this, Kurt.

33:00.864 --> 33:02.748
It's no accident that we were together

33:02.799 --> 33:04.967
on Christmas and again
on Valentine's Day.

33:05.001 --> 33:08.036
And we're going to be together
for many, many more,

33:08.054 --> 33:10.205
no matter how much you pretend

33:10.223 --> 33:12.391
that this doesn't mean anything.

I'll see you downstairs.

33:19.716 --> 33:21.433
(door opens)

33:21.484 --> 33:22.685
Okay.

(door closes)

33:26.990 --> 33:28.824
(sighs)

33:34.497 --> 33:37.333
So that's why college girls experiment.

33:37.367 --> 33:38.567
And thank God they do.

33:38.585 --> 33:40.536
You know, it was fun,
and I've always wondered

33:40.570 --> 33:42.321
what it would be like
to be with a woman,

33:42.355 --> 33:43.956
but, uh, I don't know.
I think for me

33:44.007 --> 33:45.291
it was more of a one-time thing.

33:45.342 --> 33:46.625
Look, you don't have to worry.

33:46.676 --> 33:49.712
I'm not going to show up
at your house with a U-Haul.

33:49.746 --> 33:51.747
(laughs)

33:53.383 --> 33:54.633
So what happens next?

33:54.684 --> 33:57.519
Well, you could walk out first.

33:57.554 --> 34:00.723
Or we could make it
a two-time thing?

34:04.361 --> 34:06.312
Was it good for you?

34:06.363 --> 34:08.847
I don't know. You?

34:08.882 --> 34:11.166
No idea.

34:11.201 --> 34:13.202
(both laughing)

34:16.606 --> 34:20.376
(sighs) I'm sorry. Eh, don't be.

34:20.409 --> 34:23.161
But you spent so much money on this room.
No, I didn't.

34:23.213 --> 34:25.164
I just snagged a key card
from the maid's cart

34:25.215 --> 34:26.581
and tried every door till one opened.

34:26.616 --> 34:29.051
Are you serious?
No.

34:29.085 --> 34:31.053
(laughs)

34:31.087 --> 34:33.672
Come on. Can we at least
make it back downstairs

34:33.723 --> 34:36.175
for another dance?

34:36.226 --> 34:38.226
Let's go.

35:05.467 --> 35:07.267
Hello? My God.

35:07.302 --> 35:08.936
This is amazing.

35:08.970 --> 35:11.305
Just a little something
I threw together.

35:11.339 --> 35:13.774
Only took two whole days,
but you're worth it.

35:13.808 --> 35:15.275
Thank you.

35:15.310 --> 35:18.612
I felt bad about us not being together

35:18.646 --> 35:20.814
on Valentine's Day, but since, uh,

35:20.848 --> 35:24.618
Kurt and Santana are out until tomorrow,

35:24.652 --> 35:26.787
I thought we could take advantage.

35:31.326 --> 35:33.193
Did you kiss somebody else
when you were away?

35:33.211 --> 35:36.129
You're kissing differently.
What if I did?

35:36.164 --> 35:38.966
I thought we were in a modern and
open relationship. Yeah, we are.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.001
But, I mean, the key is
that we are honest

35:41.035 --> 35:42.636
with each other
with everything that we do.

35:42.670 --> 35:44.805
So, did you see Finn?

35:44.839 --> 35:46.673
Finn's fine.
He lives in Ohio.

35:46.707 --> 35:48.708
And I live here with you.

35:48.726 --> 35:50.710
Cool?

35:50.728 --> 35:52.679
Like a cucumber.
(laughs)

35:52.713 --> 35:55.098
Thank you for being honest with me.

35:56.684 --> 35:59.019
Well, speaking of being
honest, what about you, huh?

35:59.053 --> 36:01.388
Mm-hmm. Who did you see?
Who did you do?

36:01.406 --> 36:02.823
Sure there are a lot lonely girls

36:02.857 --> 36:04.191
in New York City on Valentine's Day.

36:04.225 --> 36:08.629
I stayed at home and watched
weightlifting videos.

36:15.403 --> 36:17.571
Well, thank you for
being honest with me.

36:19.374 --> 36:21.741
Care to join me in the bedroom?

36:21.759 --> 36:23.544
(sighs)

36:23.578 --> 36:25.345
Is it okay if I pass tonight?

36:25.380 --> 36:26.913
I have airplane belly.

36:26.931 --> 36:28.915
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course.

36:28.933 --> 36:31.869
I am kind of worn out
from the night before you left.

36:31.903 --> 36:34.571
Okay, so, couch time and... Yes!

36:34.622 --> 36:36.189
...I will get
some popcorn.

36:38.159 --> 36:40.377
I'm glad to have you back.

36:40.411 --> 36:41.528
I genuinely missed you.

36:48.636 --> 36:50.804
(school bell ringing) Before
you say anything, I'm sorry.

36:50.838 --> 36:52.973
I'm sorry that I attacked
you at the reception.

36:53.007 --> 36:55.392
It's just, I saw you up
there, singing with Blaine,

36:55.426 --> 36:57.728
and I saw the old, legendary chemistry.

36:57.762 --> 36:59.846
I saw two soul mates
rediscovering each other,

36:59.880 --> 37:01.765
and I was jealous.

37:01.816 --> 37:03.600
Why couldn't that be me?

37:03.651 --> 37:05.152
Why can't I have that with someone?

37:05.186 --> 37:06.570
You will, just not with me.

37:06.604 --> 37:08.572
I'm sorry that I've been
throwing myself at you,

37:08.606 --> 37:10.274
making a fool of myself,

37:10.325 --> 37:12.409
hoping for something
I know can never be.

37:12.443 --> 37:13.694
It's okay, Tina.
The truth is,

37:13.728 --> 37:15.078
we've all experienced
unrequited love before,

37:15.113 --> 37:16.947
and we've all done things that we wish

37:16.998 --> 37:19.583
we didn't, and we all just want
to get back to being friends.

37:19.617 --> 37:22.169
And that's just what we are.
I mean, we're just friends.

37:22.203 --> 37:24.037
Um, well, we're going
to the double feature

37:24.071 --> 37:25.589
of <i>All About Eve</i> and <i>Showgirls</i>
at the revival house

37:25.623 --> 37:26.957
if you want to come with us.
Wow.

37:27.008 --> 37:28.592
Mystery solved, Hagatha Christie.

37:28.626 --> 37:30.877
I'm gonna be a third wheel
for the rest of my life.

37:30.911 --> 37:33.046
First of all, that's
not even remotely true.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.382
Starting right now, I'm gonna
help you get a boyfriend.

37:35.416 --> 37:37.351
And second of all,
when I called you a hag,

37:37.385 --> 37:39.219
I was bringing attention to the fact

37:39.253 --> 37:41.521
that you are honoring the noble
and proud tradition of hagdom.

37:41.556 --> 37:43.273
Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, and
I, for one, am psyched

37:43.308 --> 37:45.525
that my very first hag was
someone as kick-ass as...

37:45.560 --> 37:48.145
BLAINE AND KURT:
Ms. Tina Cohen-Chang.

37:48.196 --> 37:49.813
(Tina laughs)

37:49.864 --> 37:51.615
(school bell ringing) Hey.

37:51.649 --> 37:53.984
Sorry I didn't get to
see you after the party.

37:54.035 --> 37:56.036
I wanted to say thank you.
Uh, for what?

37:56.070 --> 37:58.789
Come on. Jake is awesome
and everything, but he's not

37:58.823 --> 38:01.041
capable of that.
Any of it.

38:01.075 --> 38:05.212
I know it was you whispering
in his ear like Cyrano.

38:05.246 --> 38:06.330
Like who?

38:06.381 --> 38:07.965
Anyway, it was sweet.

38:07.999 --> 38:09.666
And romantic.

38:09.717 --> 38:11.969
And whenever you do that
for someone for real,

38:12.003 --> 38:14.788
she's going to be the
luckiest girl on the planet.

38:15.840 --> 38:18.008
It was for real.

38:23.348 --> 38:24.648
I'm sorry.

38:24.682 --> 38:26.350
I should probably go.

38:26.401 --> 38:28.402
Yeah.

38:42.321 --> 38:43.688
(school bell ringing)

38:45.691 --> 38:49.310
Uh, that was a fresh cup.
Clearly it's not working.

38:49.328 --> 38:51.163
You're sitting there
looking half-asleep.

38:51.197 --> 38:53.147
What has gotten into you, Finn?
Everything.

38:53.166 --> 38:55.483
The whole situation... it sucks,
and it's time to fix it.

38:55.501 --> 38:57.702
No one ever felt

38:57.753 --> 39:00.172
better sitting around, moping,
feeling sorry for themselves.

39:00.206 --> 39:03.041
That's what Glee Club, and you,
have taught me over the years.

39:03.092 --> 39:05.994
Never shy away from a challenge,
never back down.

39:06.012 --> 39:08.496
And-and no matter what,
do not give up.

39:08.514 --> 39:10.682
I am not giving up. I...

39:10.716 --> 39:12.834
I just need time to process.

39:12.852 --> 39:15.887
Look, there's no time
to process, Mr. Shue.

39:15.938 --> 39:17.272
Somewhere out there right now

39:17.306 --> 39:19.107
there's a <i>Miss</i> Pillsbury running around

39:19.141 --> 39:20.809
who should already
be a <i>Mrs. Schuester.</i>

39:21.861 --> 39:24.196
Emma needs her husband,

39:24.230 --> 39:27.399
and the New Directions!
Need both of their coaches.

39:27.450 --> 39:29.284
I'll be right by your side.

39:29.318 --> 39:31.185
I'm your best man.

39:31.204 --> 39:33.688
We're going to go
and win nationals again...

39:33.706 --> 39:34.739
together.

39:34.790 --> 39:36.841
And together,
we're gonna find your wife.

39:36.876 --> 39:38.877
And we're gonna make things right.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.881
Okay.

39:45.334 --> 39:47.335
Thank you.

39:49.055 --> 39:51.556
(school bell ringing)

39:53.893 --> 39:55.877
Surprised to see me?
No.

39:55.895 --> 39:57.896
I saw you two minutes ago. You
took forever wheeling up here.

39:57.930 --> 40:00.098
Before I went home,
I wanted to apologize

40:00.149 --> 40:02.317
for being so bitchy at the wedding.

40:02.351 --> 40:05.219
When I get nervous, I get kind of mean.

40:05.238 --> 40:06.905
<i>Kind of</i> mean?
You were like <i>Idi Amin</i> mean.

40:06.939 --> 40:08.556
I know, I'm working on that.

40:08.574 --> 40:10.558
Anyway, thanks for putting up with me.

40:10.576 --> 40:12.110
And thanks for...

40:12.161 --> 40:14.395
You're, like, the best I've ever had.

40:14.413 --> 40:15.947
And I've had a lot.

40:15.998 --> 40:17.332
Oh, me, too.

40:17.366 --> 40:19.567
I mean, my sexual prowess is legendary

40:22.838 --> 40:25.290
Give me your digits, woman.

40:25.341 --> 40:27.792
Why? 'Cause this Saturday
I'm taking you out.

40:27.843 --> 40:31.796
Like on a date?
Yes, definitely a date.

40:31.847 --> 40:33.414
We'll grab some dinner,
maybe see a movie...

40:33.432 --> 40:36.101
Or we could just skip the
dinner and movie, and...
