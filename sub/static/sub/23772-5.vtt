WEBVTT

00:08.920 --> 00:10.870
Where are we?

00:10.920 --> 00:12.670
You don't remember?

00:12.720 --> 00:16.720
Er, well, we were both quite wasted,
we broke into the big house...

00:16.960 --> 00:19.910
Dennis? I'm doing
shepherd's if you want some.

00:19.960 --> 00:22.310
- No, thanks. I'm good.
- Shit! Now I remember.

00:22.360 --> 00:24.350
You said Denise was
staying somewhere else.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.950
Well, she was but she came back
in the middle of the night.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.230
I should have expected
it. She turns to stone

00:29.280 --> 00:30.870
if she's caught out at sunrise!

00:30.920 --> 00:32.910
This is serious. What the
fuck am I supposed to do --

00:32.960 --> 00:34.350
shimmy down the drain pipe?

00:34.400 --> 00:35.710
Just wait until she goes.

00:35.760 --> 00:36.910
I can't.

00:36.960 --> 00:39.270
I've got to go. I'm running late as it is.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.350
God, Lee had better have got the kids up.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.670
Be better off leaving the puppy in charge.

00:43.720 --> 00:46.150
Look, just come down. What's
the worst that can happen?

00:46.200 --> 00:50.200
Well, I slip on the stairs and
break my neck before she sees me?

00:50.640 --> 00:53.130
Wait -- that's the best-case scenario.

00:53.680 --> 00:54.870
Come on...

00:54.920 --> 00:58.920
.. scaredy.

01:05.920 --> 01:08.830
Jeez, open a window! That stinks.

01:08.880 --> 01:12.880
I find it rather invigorating.
Gets me up ready for the day.

01:13.200 --> 01:17.200
Or maybe I should. There seems
to be a foul stench around here.

01:18.160 --> 01:22.030
- Morning. - Look, let's not
make this any more awkward

01:22.080 --> 01:25.030
- than it needs to be.
- No.

01:25.080 --> 01:27.270
- Let's.
- I'm going to, er, go now.

01:27.320 --> 01:30.150
Um, I couldn't find one of
my socks, so if it turns up...

01:30.200 --> 01:32.710
- I'll burn it.
- Hazel, what the...?

01:32.760 --> 01:34.630
- Denise.
- You gave her another key?

01:34.680 --> 01:36.310
I've only just changed the locks.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.870
She must've stolen it.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.750
So you can have sex with me
but you can't stay the night?

01:40.800 --> 01:42.030
Shall I call the police?

01:42.080 --> 01:43.550
- No.
- Who are you?

01:43.600 --> 01:45.350
Did she come back here
to have sex with you?

01:45.400 --> 01:47.350
I came back to have sex with her brother.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.670
I think. Did we?

01:48.720 --> 01:52.720
- Not sure.
- Um, Denise, I-I-I'll see you later.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.150
You see, this has got a sad
face and I've got a sad face too.

01:59.200 --> 02:03.200
- Please don't be late again.
- Sorry, Martin.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.790
Well, Rose, Rose, Rose, Rose, Rose.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.630
You were doing so well.

02:07.680 --> 02:10.990
Sorry. Going to have to
mark you down for tardiness.

02:11.039 --> 02:13.710
Careful, Martin --
that's an offensive term.

02:16.680 --> 02:18.710
- No, it isn't.
- Well, what's it short for?

02:18.760 --> 02:20.070
It's not short for anything.

02:20.120 --> 02:21.830
Tardiness means lateness.

02:21.880 --> 02:25.310
Oh! You learn something new every day.

02:25.360 --> 02:28.550
Well, yes, Nat, I see you're
looking for a birthing partner.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.950
Yes. They get free crisps and water...

02:31.000 --> 02:32.390
- Mm-hm.
- It's just a backup.

02:32.440 --> 02:36.390
I think my fella, Dev, will
have told his wife by then.

02:36.440 --> 02:38.030
Told her what?

02:38.080 --> 02:40.350
About me, about the baby,

02:40.400 --> 02:43.030
about the fact that we're going
to move to a castle in Wales.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.430
But mainly about the baby,

02:44.480 --> 02:48.310
because that's the thing
that's going to happen soon.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.190
He's got to pick the right moment, really.

02:50.240 --> 02:52.110
Yes, you'll have to be
very, very selective

02:52.160 --> 02:55.030
about the right moment for that, I think.

02:55.080 --> 02:57.310
Nat, if you're looking
for a birthing partner...

02:57.360 --> 03:00.190
No, thanks, Mimi, don't know you
well enough to let you see my bits.

03:00.240 --> 03:02.790
I was actually going to say
that a friend of mine is a doula.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.510
OK, well, I'm not religious, so...

03:04.560 --> 03:06.830
A doula is a female birth coach.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.710
All births are female.

03:08.760 --> 03:12.760
Well, actually, it depends
on how you identify, so...

03:14.680 --> 03:16.750
Just had a call from Zadie Taylor.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.230
I thought that was all sorted --
case closed, moving on with her life.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.670
Oh! If I don't help her, who will?

03:21.720 --> 03:24.950
She's been skipping English classes
at her sixth-form college --

03:25.000 --> 03:27.630
something about the
sexually explicit books.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.190
Why are you late anyway?

03:29.240 --> 03:32.070
I can't say -- genuinely
too traumatic to explain.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.550
Oh, quickie with Lee?

03:34.600 --> 03:38.110
Dennis!

03:38.160 --> 03:41.230
- Holy fucking shit.
- And Denise was there when I left.

03:41.280 --> 03:44.150
- Oh, Christ! - Being confronted
by her angry lesbian lover.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.670
God. I'm going to have to
go into a foetal crouch.

03:46.720 --> 03:50.720
- You had a call, Rose,
about the Donahue kid. - OK.

03:51.040 --> 03:55.040
Oh! Shit, I must've
dropped the Post-it Note.

03:55.400 --> 03:59.400
- Found it.
- Oh.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.590
Oh, bollocks. The little Donahue
girl's been coming to school

04:03.640 --> 04:04.910
hungry and dirty.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.510
Oh, is that the seven-year-old
with the mum and dad on heroin?

04:07.560 --> 04:10.630
Yeah, I agreed to let them try
alternating the weeks that they use,

04:10.680 --> 04:12.950
so we wouldn't have to
take Ellie into care.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.709
Doesn't really work, though, does it -- part-time
junkie? Bit like a Nazi -- it's all nothing.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.589
Are you comparing junkies and Nazis?

04:18.640 --> 04:21.110
No, but Hitler was ripped
to the tits by the end --

04:21.160 --> 04:22.510
he was a massive cokehead.

04:22.560 --> 04:25.910
And yet he always seemed so
calm and reasonable in public.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.910
Right, better head off to the Donahues'.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.950
- Want any drugs?
- No need -- I've dispatched Nitin.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.990
Oh, just for one happy moment there
I thought you meant "dispatched"

04:34.040 --> 04:37.230
- in the hitman sense.
- But they're my clients, Mart.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.790
Yes, and you weren't
here. So I sent Nitin.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.590
He's not used to dealing with addicts.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.390
I mean, they can be wily little fuckers.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.150
He'll never get through the front door.

04:45.200 --> 04:48.070
He must know the old "I
need a poo" trick by now?

04:48.120 --> 04:49.870
Well, I doubt he'll remember.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.310
The school said she's obese.

04:52.360 --> 04:55.070
I said to the teacher, "You need
to stay off the pies yourself, love.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.910
"You look like Eamonn Holmes in a dress."

04:56.960 --> 04:58.470
Then she tried to hit me, so I...

04:58.520 --> 05:01.070
Right, I am off to see Zadie.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.830
Ooh. Actually, I was wondering,
would you mind taking Mimi with you?

05:04.880 --> 05:06.470
Oh, what the...?

05:06.520 --> 05:10.470
- Why? - Well, she needs
more practical experience.

05:10.520 --> 05:12.230
Also, between you and me,

05:12.280 --> 05:15.510
I'm finding the old feminine
theorising a bit much.

05:15.560 --> 05:18.750
Especially as she seems to
think that it's all news to me.

05:18.800 --> 05:22.430
She obviously hasn't seen The
Female Eunuch on my bookshelf.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.750
Is she still living with you? Cos
I thought that was only temporary.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.350
Don't fuss, Al. Well, let's face it --

05:28.400 --> 05:31.030
the young have it much harder than we did.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.710
All right, she can tag along.

05:32.760 --> 05:35.110
But if she goes on too much,
I may have to use headphones.

05:35.160 --> 05:39.160
- To strangle her with.
- Right. That... That would be... Be murder.

05:39.520 --> 05:43.520
Mimi.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:16.320 --> 06:18.150
OK. Well,

06:18.200 --> 06:20.870
I was waiting for you to ask who I
am but I guess we can skip that.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.230
I'm from Elm Heath Social Services.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.870
Oh, where's the woman?

06:24.920 --> 06:27.510
Rose? We don't know --
that's why they sent me.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.630
I've heard reports from school that
your daughter Ellie is unkempt.

06:30.680 --> 06:32.710
- You what?
- Unkempt.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.990
It's the opposite of "kempt".

06:35.040 --> 06:37.910
Pretty sure "kempt" is a word.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.750
Untidy, unwashed clothes.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.590
Can I come in and talk?

06:41.640 --> 06:45.310
No. We're talking here --
why do you need to come in?

06:45.360 --> 06:49.350
- Er, I need the loo.
- Piss off t'balcony -- that's what I do.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.270
Well, that's illegal.

06:51.320 --> 06:55.320
And, crucially, I need to do a number two.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.510
I need to pass a solid.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.350
Can't really do that off a balcony.

07:00.400 --> 07:04.400
Sounds like a challenge.

07:08.840 --> 07:12.840
Up the stairs, on the left.

07:17.320 --> 07:20.150
What?

07:20.200 --> 07:22.430
Oh, it's cool, man.

07:22.480 --> 07:26.480
It's her week on.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.470
Have you got a stay of
execution on the section 47

07:29.520 --> 07:33.110
providing one of you is responsible adult?

07:33.160 --> 07:34.950
- Section what?
- Section 47.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.470
It's part of the 1989 Children Act.

07:36.520 --> 07:40.520
- I can give you a brief summary...
- I thought you needed a shit.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.510
Yep, let me just go and...

07:43.560 --> 07:47.560
.. pass my stool.

07:54.520 --> 07:58.520
Oh!

07:59.480 --> 08:01.910
Ooh.

08:01.960 --> 08:05.960
Oh.

08:13.240 --> 08:14.950
Er, sorry, still waiting for the boss.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.710
- Shouldn't be much longer.
- No problem.

08:16.760 --> 08:19.550
We can reschedule if it's easier.
We don't want to be taking up time

08:19.600 --> 08:21.590
you could be spending
on more important cases.

08:21.640 --> 08:24.430
Oh, well your case is fairly serious,

08:24.480 --> 08:28.190
in that your child could
have ingested cocaine.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.510
You said you only used at work.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.670
You swore you never
brought it into the house.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.350
A couple of times when I was with him,

08:33.400 --> 08:35.030
I-I needed a line to get through it.

08:35.080 --> 08:38.590
- Jesus. - The noise at
soft play is a nightmare.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.270
- It helps me focus... - No! - I've
been meaning to explain... - Fuck off!

08:41.320 --> 08:43.030
.. but there hasn't been the right moment.

08:43.080 --> 08:47.080
- So you're living with Martin now?
- "Living with" is a very loaded term.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.750
Well, I meant it literally,

08:48.800 --> 08:51.390
not in a pejorative,
negative, judgmental way.

08:51.440 --> 08:52.990
Thanks for qualifying "pejorative".

08:53.040 --> 08:54.830
Could you define
"patronising" for me, too?

08:54.880 --> 08:57.430
- Let's just rewind, shall we?
- Fine with me.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.590
This time, don't criticise
my private life.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.390
Mimi, if you want to do this for a living,

09:01.440 --> 09:04.190
you're going to have to lower
your defences with your colleagues,

09:04.240 --> 09:06.030
you know. It's a lot of pressure.

09:06.080 --> 09:09.190
- We can help each other.
- Didn't sound like you were trying to help me.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.910
Anyway, I've seen you browsing
job sites in your lunch break.

09:11.960 --> 09:15.870
You're bailing on your colleagues.

09:17.720 --> 09:18.420
Jesus!

09:20.520 --> 09:23.230
- Morning, Denise. Hello, Elm
Heath Children... - It's Nitin.

09:23.280 --> 09:26.550
- Hi, Nitin. - Can I
speak to Rose? - Rose?

09:26.600 --> 09:28.550
- Rose.
- Hurry up.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.430
- What's the weather like there?
- I don't care! - All right. God!

09:31.480 --> 09:33.710
- Yes?
- Nitin's on the line for you.

09:33.760 --> 09:37.760
- Rose, my office, please.
- Won't be a sec, Denise.

09:41.720 --> 09:44.390
- Nitin. - Yes. - If
you're going to send people

09:44.440 --> 09:46.550
pictures of turd-blocked toilets,

09:46.600 --> 09:49.510
some context or explanation might be nice.

09:49.560 --> 09:51.750
I have never seen
anything like this place.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.510
We need to bring them in and we
need to apply for a care order.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.670
You know that a care order
is the absolute last resort.

09:57.720 --> 10:00.030
Oh, please not a care order.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.110
It's terrible to split up families.

10:02.160 --> 10:05.750
That's the least of it. The
paperwork is excruciating.

10:05.800 --> 10:09.630
Look, I'm not saying that picture
isn't disgusting, all right?

10:09.680 --> 10:12.590
But it doesn't place Ellie at any risk.

10:12.640 --> 10:15.070
It's a shit-print -- my
kids do those all the time.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.430
Clean it up with a
Dettol wipe and move on.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.590
It's not shit.

10:19.640 --> 10:21.430
It's blood.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.530
Hi, Mum.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.970
What are you doing here?

10:27.020 --> 10:31.020
I'm from the school. Ellie didn't
feel well, so I brought her home.

10:31.460 --> 10:35.170
- Her parents said they couldn't pick her up.
- OK, I'm a social worker.

10:35.220 --> 10:39.220
- Oh, fuck's sake! - Get her out
of here -- she shouldn't see this.

10:40.660 --> 10:43.210
Hey, sit up!

10:43.260 --> 10:47.260
- Are you going to help?
- I've got sick on me... haven't I?

10:50.100 --> 10:54.100
Can you get some hot
water? Mum's not very well.

10:56.020 --> 10:58.410
- Are you OK from here?
- What do you think?

10:58.460 --> 11:01.210
If you're just going to stand there, go!

11:02.660 --> 11:04.050
Hazel, it's me.

11:04.100 --> 11:07.370
I just wanted to emphasise that
what I said the other night

11:07.420 --> 11:10.530
about possibly misremembering
facts about the football club

11:10.580 --> 11:13.090
was very confidential.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.410
And, er...

11:14.460 --> 11:16.330
.. there would be very
serious consequences

11:16.380 --> 11:19.170
if you were to repeat it.

11:19.220 --> 11:22.130
And about the Katherine
Jenkins CDs, you keep them.

11:22.180 --> 11:23.850
You keep them all -- that's fine.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.050
OK? Bye.

11:25.100 --> 11:26.770
OK, Mum, let's clean you up.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.490
OK, here you go.

11:28.540 --> 11:32.330
Thanks. Oh, my net knife.

11:32.380 --> 11:35.770
I had to use it to stop the man.

11:35.820 --> 11:39.210
- He's gone now.
- The man's my dealer.

11:39.260 --> 11:40.970
Ex-dealer.

11:41.020 --> 11:44.730
Ex-dealer as in he used to be my
dealer, not as in I killed him.

11:44.780 --> 11:46.410
Yeah?

11:46.460 --> 11:49.730
Though he deserves it.

11:49.780 --> 11:52.530
- What are you doing?
- Well, I thought while you were here,

11:52.580 --> 11:55.210
you could be t'responsible adult and that.

11:55.260 --> 11:58.130
We're going! Now!

11:58.180 --> 12:01.170
- Hey, Zadie.
- Al.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.770
This is Mimi. She's on a placement,

12:03.820 --> 12:06.290
so she's going to be
sitting in if that's OK.

12:06.340 --> 12:10.340
- Yeah, fine.
- OK.

12:11.900 --> 12:15.900
So, er, Zadie says that she's
been skipping your classes.

12:16.780 --> 12:20.730
- I know she has. - She just a bit
uncomfortable with some of the texts

12:20.780 --> 12:23.090
- you've been teaching.
- OK.

12:23.140 --> 12:26.090
Er... which text in particular?

12:26.140 --> 12:27.730
Lady Chatterley's Lover.

12:27.780 --> 12:30.330
Well, that's fairly
tame by modern standards.

12:30.380 --> 12:32.490
- Lolita.
- That's a more challenging one.

12:32.540 --> 12:35.130
- 50 Shades Of Grey.
- Why would you teach them that?

12:35.180 --> 12:37.050
It romanticises abuse.

12:37.100 --> 12:39.010
- Mimi, just...
- Well, it does.

12:39.060 --> 12:41.410
No, its... I happen to agree with her.

12:41.460 --> 12:42.850
I teach it to examine why it is

12:42.900 --> 12:45.050
that bad writing and dangerous ideas sell.

12:45.100 --> 12:47.530
You know, what does it say about
us as a society, about the way

12:47.580 --> 12:49.090
- we treat women?
- Very convenient.

12:49.140 --> 12:50.890
You made me read bits of it out, though,

12:50.940 --> 12:53.530
and asked me how it made me
feel. And it made me feel shit.

12:53.580 --> 12:55.970
Yeah, well, it made me feel
shit as well. It's a shit book.

12:56.020 --> 12:59.370
It upset me!

12:59.420 --> 13:03.370
This isn't America, where students
are cosseted and left unchallenged.

13:03.420 --> 13:06.930
Art and literature should make
us feel uncomfortable at times.

13:06.980 --> 13:10.130
Life doesn't come with a trigger
warning, and neither do my classes.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.890
You know what? I've seen this before.

13:11.940 --> 13:14.330
You're a gaslighter. I knew
it the moment I walked in.

13:14.380 --> 13:18.010
- No. - He is, he's a gaslighter. He's blaming
you for being uptight to conceal the fact

13:18.060 --> 13:20.930
- you get turned on making young
women read out sex fantasies... - No.

13:20.980 --> 13:23.530
- .. from books. - Look, can I
speak for myself, please? - Yes.

13:23.580 --> 13:25.090
You don't know me.

13:25.140 --> 13:28.970
You don't know him. And
that isn't what he's doing.

13:29.020 --> 13:31.090
I do need the trigger warning.

13:31.140 --> 13:32.730
Because of what happened in care?

13:32.780 --> 13:35.490
- Excuse me? Have you read my file?
- Absolutely not, no.

13:35.540 --> 13:37.930
It would seem so.

13:37.980 --> 13:39.450
I thought you was on a placement.

13:39.500 --> 13:42.650
Yeah, she's learning and the first
lesson today is you do not browse

13:42.700 --> 13:46.700
other clients' files without
their permission, OK?

13:46.900 --> 13:50.900
Ever.

13:52.740 --> 13:54.850
All right, mate? What are you in for?

13:54.900 --> 13:56.930
Nitin, you've obviously
got your hands full here,

13:56.980 --> 13:58.370
- so why don't we postpone?
- No, I want

13:58.420 --> 14:00.170
to know exactly what's been going on.

14:00.220 --> 14:03.250
- Why? Has he been a naughty boy?
- Honestly, I told you all there is to know.

14:03.300 --> 14:07.130
- You have the full picture now. There's
nothing to gained by being here. - Oi!

14:07.180 --> 14:08.770
I'm talking to you, you twat.

14:08.820 --> 14:11.170
Dad! You said a rude word!

14:11.220 --> 14:13.410
Sorry, sweetheart. But he is a twat.

14:13.460 --> 14:16.090
Yeah, actually, he is a twat.

14:16.140 --> 14:20.140
Sorry, sorry.

14:21.380 --> 14:22.690
Nick, what... What happened?

14:22.740 --> 14:25.610
It's fucking hard, innit? Amy don't
want to come off of it for the week

14:25.660 --> 14:27.970
so I just have to dip in and out.

14:28.020 --> 14:31.850
- Can't do it.
- We had a contract of expectations.

14:31.900 --> 14:34.810
- A what?
- One of you had to stay clean.

14:34.860 --> 14:36.290
I got me weeks mixed up.

14:36.340 --> 14:37.730
I do that all the time.

14:37.780 --> 14:40.370
Yeah, maybe not with
such heavy consequences.

14:40.420 --> 14:43.730
You say that, but I missed
a Gary Barlow concert once.

14:43.780 --> 14:45.370
- It's not a big deal.
- I suppose not.

14:45.420 --> 14:47.490
Jason Orange was always my fave.

14:47.540 --> 14:51.540
And this is without you attacking
your dealer with a knife in front of

14:51.900 --> 14:55.610
your daughter. She wiped
blood on the wall.

14:55.660 --> 14:57.210
So, give us a cleaner.

14:57.260 --> 15:01.260
This is serious! You're
going to lose Ellie.

15:01.420 --> 15:05.420
Right, Nitin's brought me up to speed.

15:05.660 --> 15:09.130
We want to take your daughter into
foster care while this is sorted and

15:09.180 --> 15:11.490
it's better for everyone
if it's voluntary.

15:11.540 --> 15:14.330
Otherwise, we apply for a court order.

15:14.380 --> 15:17.010
- Is she still high?
- Yeah, lucky girl.

15:17.060 --> 15:20.810
Mr Donahue, do you
understand what I'm saying?

15:20.860 --> 15:23.410
If you give up Ellie voluntarily,

15:23.460 --> 15:26.250
you retain control over
aspects of her care.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.290
Visitation rights and so on.

15:28.340 --> 15:31.010
If we go via the courts,
we control everything.

15:31.060 --> 15:35.060
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.930
Now you're all looking at
me like I'm a piece of shit.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.650
Yeah, but what you don't
understand is that I am trying to do

15:42.700 --> 15:46.700
the right thing here. See, I'm a shit dad.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.170
But a fucking great junkie.

15:50.220 --> 15:53.410
So...

15:53.460 --> 15:57.010
She's better off without me.

15:57.060 --> 15:59.970
Us.

16:00.020 --> 16:01.450
So...

16:01.500 --> 16:02.690
.. take her. Just take her.

16:02.740 --> 16:04.690
Are you going to try and get clean?

16:04.740 --> 16:08.450
I have tried, loads.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.050
Can't do it. It's too hard.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.370
So, just...

16:12.420 --> 16:14.370
Just take her, yeah?

16:14.420 --> 16:16.810
- For good. - You know, I watched...
I watched your daughter...

16:16.860 --> 16:19.090
- Fuck off. - .. and she wiped
puke off her own mother.

16:19.140 --> 16:20.810
And you sat there and you did nothing!

16:20.860 --> 16:22.330
Nitin!

16:22.380 --> 16:24.330
Out.

16:24.380 --> 16:28.380
- Unbelievable! - Yeah, that was
really fucking helpful, wasn't it?

16:30.620 --> 16:33.810
Here you go, Ellie. Juice,
biscuits and a banana.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.210
The banana's on and the turn,

16:35.260 --> 16:37.370
but that's when they're at their sweetest.

16:37.420 --> 16:38.530
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.770
Do you know how much longer I'll be?

16:40.820 --> 16:43.370
Er... no, I'm afraid I don't.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.210
I have to get back to put their tea on.

16:45.260 --> 16:47.610
So, you cook for them, do you?

16:47.660 --> 16:50.050
Just easy stuff, like beans on toast.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.050
Sorry, I don't mean to be an arsehole,

16:59.100 --> 17:01.650
but we were told earlier that you
didn't provide tea or coffee.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.290
That girl has a drink and biscuits.

17:03.340 --> 17:06.010
Yes, I'm sorry, but you
are being an A-hole.

17:06.060 --> 17:08.650
So, sit down... Sit down!

17:08.700 --> 17:12.700
And we'll get to you when we can.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.290
Eat up!

17:16.339 --> 17:19.290
Zadie, I had no idea.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.770
I wasn't briefed on this.

17:21.819 --> 17:23.089
You should've said something.

17:23.140 --> 17:25.210
What? In front of the class?

17:25.260 --> 17:27.210
It's just, I want to put it behind me.

17:27.260 --> 17:29.290
I don't want to talk about it again.

17:29.340 --> 17:32.050
- Yeah. - I think what you
should learn from this, Aidan,

17:32.100 --> 17:33.690
is that words have consequences.

17:33.740 --> 17:36.570
Yeah, apparently not the ones I
said to you earlier about butting in.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.250
I was just expressing solidarity.

17:38.300 --> 17:40.610
What? You think we're sisters?

17:40.660 --> 17:43.090
- You think we're blood?
- I just think that I will have an insight

17:43.140 --> 17:44.810
- and an empathy...
- But how? How, though?

17:44.860 --> 17:46.450
That...

17:46.500 --> 17:49.970
As women, I just think that
you and I would understand...

17:50.020 --> 17:52.010
There would be an
understanding that I would get

17:52.060 --> 17:54.850
that these two certainly
wouldn't. Especially...

17:54.900 --> 17:57.890
- Especially him.
- Can you get out, please?

17:57.940 --> 18:00.610
- Why? - Because I don't want to lose
my place at this college and if you

18:00.660 --> 18:04.660
don't get out, I'm going to slap you!

18:09.380 --> 18:12.250
So, off the record, that's
free drinks for life

18:12.300 --> 18:15.210
- from all the staff at Elm Heath
Social Services. - She's 17.

18:15.260 --> 18:19.260
I know. As I was saying that, I realised.

18:22.900 --> 18:25.170
- Martin.
- Mum, Dad!

18:25.220 --> 18:27.210
Hey, just need you to
stay here for me, Ellie.

18:27.260 --> 18:31.260
It's all right, just
stay here for a second.

18:34.820 --> 18:37.250
- What about Ellie?
- She's staying.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.250
What?! No...

18:39.300 --> 18:42.370
- Look, I'll explain later, yeah?
Just come on, please. - Ellie!

18:42.420 --> 18:43.970
Come here, sweetie!

18:44.020 --> 18:46.090
Let me through! Open the door!

18:46.140 --> 18:50.090
Oh, come on! Come on!

18:50.140 --> 18:54.140
What you looking at?! Eh?

18:57.220 --> 18:59.890
- I fucked that up, didn't I?
- Yep.

18:59.940 --> 19:02.170
Go on, then. Rub it in. Do your worst.

19:02.220 --> 19:03.810
Do you know what? I can't be bothered.

19:03.860 --> 19:06.410
I think maybe that'll just
sit with you for a while

19:06.460 --> 19:10.460
- and might even help you.
- Oh. I was all psyched up for a row.

19:10.860 --> 19:12.570
I think that's why I
find you so annoying --

19:12.620 --> 19:14.850
- you're too easy on people.
- Yeah, well, conversely,

19:14.900 --> 19:18.010
the reason I find you so annoying is
cos you always want to have a fight.

19:18.060 --> 19:21.010
It's cos I want change in
people's minds and behaviours!

19:21.060 --> 19:23.770
You can only change what's in front
of you and you can't force people

19:23.820 --> 19:26.170
to think like you. And,
anyway, things HAVE changed!

19:26.220 --> 19:28.930
You know, when I started doing
this, you'd still hear the N-word.

19:28.980 --> 19:31.290
You'd hear the P-word every day.

19:31.340 --> 19:33.490
Everyone was homophobic!

19:33.540 --> 19:37.540
I'm not saying it's gone, but it is less.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.970
- Thank you.
- Apologies for the delay.

19:42.020 --> 19:44.530
Oh, no, no. Don't apologise.

19:44.580 --> 19:47.370
You were dealing with those
poor drug addicts -- so awful.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.410
Your husband's a drug addict.

19:49.460 --> 19:50.890
He's nothing like those people!

19:50.940 --> 19:52.730
He told me that he uses
during night feeds.

19:52.780 --> 19:54.210
What?!

19:54.260 --> 19:57.050
What the fuck?! Every time you swear
to me you're telling the truth

19:57.100 --> 19:59.090
and then there's just
another layer to this shit.

19:59.140 --> 20:01.010
- Don't listen to him.
- No! - And he's an alcoholic.

20:01.060 --> 20:03.730
For fuck's sake, Zak. You've spent
the last year making me feel like

20:03.780 --> 20:07.090
- everything's my fault but you're the
one with the problem! - No, no, no...

20:07.140 --> 20:08.290
- Look, look...
- Shut up!

20:08.340 --> 20:10.130
Hey, I am willing to make this work.

20:10.180 --> 20:11.930
But you have to be honest.

20:11.980 --> 20:15.980
Have you done the night feeds on coke?

20:16.300 --> 20:18.890
Er... Sophie, I've done
most things on coke,

20:18.940 --> 20:22.940
including our wedding and
the birth of our child.

20:25.820 --> 20:27.330
You despicable cunt!

20:27.380 --> 20:29.450
I've wanted to say that
for a fucking long time!

20:29.500 --> 20:32.090
- It was 27 hours. - Oh, fuck off!
- You wanted me to be there for you!

20:32.140 --> 20:34.010
- Fuck off!
- Look, I had to do something...

20:34.060 --> 20:38.050
That couple in before have put
their child into care voluntarily.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.890
But I could've done it through the courts

20:39.940 --> 20:43.850
because their child was exposed to
drugs, violence, God knows what.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.650
Nitin found cocaine in YOUR house.

20:46.700 --> 20:49.890
YOUR child could have
accidentally ingested it and died.

20:49.940 --> 20:53.250
Unlike the previous couple, you
have the money and wherewithal

20:53.300 --> 20:56.410
to try and deal with
your problems. So, try!

20:56.460 --> 20:59.130
If I see you again, I'll
be issuing a court order.

20:59.180 --> 21:03.180
Rose, a word in my office,
please. Nitin, wrap this up.

21:07.020 --> 21:08.370
So, going forward...

21:08.420 --> 21:10.770
With the Donahues, we all
signed off on that approach, OK,

21:10.820 --> 21:12.930
and last time I visited, they were coping.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.930
Yes, yes. I understand that.

21:14.980 --> 21:17.330
This morning was
mortifying for both of us.

21:17.380 --> 21:19.330
Listen, I really like your brother.

21:19.380 --> 21:22.250
Please -- my gag reflex
is not that sturdy.

21:22.300 --> 21:25.330
Look, whatever you're going through
in your private life is your business.

21:25.380 --> 21:28.770
I'm not going through anything in my private
life. THAT'S what I wanted to make clear.

21:28.820 --> 21:32.730
That woman who came round this morning
-- she is very troubled and delusional.

21:32.780 --> 21:34.490
She makes wild accusations...

21:34.540 --> 21:38.540
- Right. - So, any mention of it at
work would reflect very badly on you.

21:38.780 --> 21:40.050
I wasn't going to mention it.

21:40.100 --> 21:43.410
I mean, it's not as if I treat
every bit of personal information

21:43.460 --> 21:46.330
- as a weapon.
- Really?

21:46.380 --> 21:49.010
- I do. - I've got to find
a foster family for Ellie.

21:49.060 --> 21:52.770
Yes, yes, go.

21:52.820 --> 21:54.930
My son has gone on holiday in England!

21:54.980 --> 21:56.290
- You're what, sorry?
- My son!

21:56.340 --> 21:58.530
- And I haven't been able to
get in touch with him. - Right.

21:58.580 --> 22:00.330
And I thought, "You
ought to try services."

22:00.380 --> 22:03.090
He's 44 years old, but he's
as thick as brick-shit.

22:03.140 --> 22:04.770
Can you get him to give me a call?

22:04.820 --> 22:06.170
OK.

22:06.220 --> 22:07.810
I already told him -- I can't be pregnant.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.410
We only had sex standing up.

22:09.460 --> 22:11.570
- Hello, children services.
- Yeah, it's me again.

22:11.620 --> 22:14.930
I know I'm only meant to call about the
kids, but I'm wondering -- are you married?

22:14.980 --> 22:16.810
And do you want to be married?

22:16.860 --> 22:18.770
All right, all right. I know I've a wife.

22:18.820 --> 22:19.970
But she won't mind, like.

22:20.020 --> 22:22.570
Do you want to watch something?

22:22.620 --> 22:24.490
I've got Netflix.

22:24.540 --> 22:28.210
I've got Dora. Or Diego.

22:28.260 --> 22:31.130
How about Team Umizoomi?

22:31.180 --> 22:33.010
I don't know what that is, but...

22:33.060 --> 22:37.060
It's here!

22:37.260 --> 22:39.650
Don't have the headphones too loud.

22:39.700 --> 22:41.210
It's not good for your ears.

22:41.260 --> 22:45.260
I like it loud. Shuts
out all the shouting.

22:48.620 --> 22:52.620
There's not going to be any more shouting.

22:55.660 --> 22:59.660
Who's this? What did we miss?

23:06.380 --> 23:10.380
♪ People, they ain't no good

23:12.620 --> 23:16.620
♪ I think that's well understood

23:19.620 --> 23:23.620
♪ You can see it everywhere you look

23:25.980 --> 23:28.210
♪ People just ain't no good. ♪
