WEBVTT

00:09.042 --> 00:11.411
(loud rattling)

00:11.411 --> 00:13.106
(gasps)

00:13.413 --> 00:15.115
You all right?

00:15.115 --> 00:17.384
(sighs):
I hate flying.

00:17.384 --> 00:19.452
It's just a little turbulence.
We'll be through it in a minute.

00:19.452 --> 00:21.154
(gasps)

00:21.154 --> 00:22.143
Mother of God!

00:22.455 --> 00:23.456
This is kind of
embarrassing.

00:23.456 --> 00:25.458
I mean, I treat people for this.

00:25.458 --> 00:27.221
I'm a psychiatrist.
Well, there's
a small world.

00:27.427 --> 00:30.230
I'm a psychiatrist, too.
Dr. Frasier Crane.

00:30.230 --> 00:31.798
Oh. I've heard your show.

00:31.798 --> 00:33.800
Dr. Anne Ranberg.
Lovely to meet you.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.301
Nice to meet you.
(chuckles)

00:35.301 --> 00:36.791
Well, don't let me
interrupt you.

00:37.303 --> 00:39.272
You seemed kind of
deep in thought.

00:39.272 --> 00:41.241
Oh, I suppose I was.

00:41.241 --> 00:44.644
It's been a rather eventful
three weeks for me.

00:44.644 --> 00:45.645
If you want to talk about it,

00:45.645 --> 00:47.135
it might get our minds
off the flight.

00:47.447 --> 00:51.247
It's really rather personal.
Nothing you'd be interested in
.

00:51.551 --> 00:54.421
Okay, then.

00:54.421 --> 00:55.822
(rattling)

00:55.822 --> 00:59.325
So, I was dating
this woman.
Mm-hmm.

00:59.325 --> 01:01.227
Weren't we on
our way to lunch?

01:01.227 --> 01:03.263
Yes.

01:03.263 --> 01:05.857
And then you followed me in here
when I came to get my briefcase

01:06.232 --> 01:09.769
and uttered the fatal phrase
that no man can resist.

01:09.769 --> 01:13.273
I said I like
your pillow shams.

01:13.273 --> 01:15.275
Nice try,
my little temptress,

01:15.275 --> 01:18.278
but I'm down
for at least an hour.

01:18.278 --> 01:21.281
Do you still have time
for lunch before work?

01:21.281 --> 01:23.272
Well, my show doesn't start
till 2:00, and it's only...

01:23.583 --> 01:25.218
Oh, dear God!

01:25.218 --> 01:26.619
Where the hell is he?
I don't know!

01:26.619 --> 01:28.621
I called his cell,
I've called his house.

01:28.621 --> 01:30.123
You're gonna have
to go on for him.

01:30.123 --> 01:31.124
Me?
Yeah, you.
Well, I'm not.

01:31.124 --> 01:32.614
Last time I did it,
it was a total disaster.

01:33.126 --> 01:35.128
Aren't you always saying
you used to be a deejay?

01:35.128 --> 01:37.697
Oh, 20 years ago.
I can't do that anymore.
It'll come back to you.

01:40.300 --> 01:43.303
My palms are sweaty,
my mouth is like cotton.

01:43.303 --> 01:46.306
Hey, Emerald City!
Kenny Daly here.

01:46.306 --> 01:47.796
Master of the mike,
baron of the booth,

01:48.308 --> 01:50.310
the man of the hour,
too sweet to be sour.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.312
The doctor's out today!

01:52.312 --> 01:53.813
But Kenny's here,

01:53.813 --> 01:55.815
filling the seat,
taking the heat.

01:55.815 --> 01:58.306
I might even throw in
a call or two to Grandma Gert.

01:58.818 --> 02:01.184
(old lady voice) :
But no kids. I hate kids!

02:01.387 --> 02:04.322
Ooh-hoo,
she's in a mood today.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.162
KENNY:
And who's this
coming into the booth?

02:09.162 --> 02:11.153
Why, it's Percy Von Snootenheim.

02:11.397 --> 02:13.733
FRASIER:
Turn that off.

02:13.733 --> 02:14.825
I'm sorry I have to rush off.

02:15.335 --> 02:17.837
I wish we could spend
the whole day together.

02:17.837 --> 02:19.739
I don't leave for
Chicago until midnight.

02:19.739 --> 02:21.241
I'll come over
and make you dinner.

02:21.241 --> 02:23.243
Oh, that sounds great.
I'd love that.

02:23.243 --> 02:25.211
Any requests?
Uh...

02:25.245 --> 02:26.913
I liked what I had for lunch.

02:26.913 --> 02:28.214
(laughs)

02:28.214 --> 02:30.183
Why don't I just surprise you.

02:30.183 --> 02:32.242
(chuckles):
Still sounding like lunch.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.689
Isn't that
a great song, people?

02:36.689 --> 02:39.192
Really brings back
the memories.

02:39.192 --> 02:42.252
Sorry I kind of forgot
the words there in the middle.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.394
So, let's toss it to the news.

02:45.865 --> 02:47.367
Where the hell
have you been?

02:47.367 --> 02:49.369
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I had a doctor's appointment.

02:49.369 --> 02:50.358
It couldn't be helped.

02:50.870 --> 02:52.372
Just in time, Doc.

02:52.372 --> 02:54.374
This turned out to be
one of your better shows.

02:54.374 --> 02:55.875
Thank you, Kenny.

02:55.875 --> 02:57.866
Darling.
Bebe! What are
you doing here?

02:58.378 --> 03:02.382
I just came by...
to see my favorite client--

03:02.382 --> 03:05.885
and the wonderful man
who's given him such
a happy, happy home.

03:05.885 --> 03:07.387
Aw, you're the
best, Bebe.

03:07.387 --> 03:11.391
Good news. I'm busting you out of
this hellhole.

03:11.391 --> 03:14.227
What?
Did you ever hear
of Dr. Mark Reisman?

03:14.227 --> 03:15.795
The San Francisco
radio psychiatrist?

03:15.795 --> 03:18.264
Yes, we had a nice encounter
once at a conference.

03:18.264 --> 03:20.867
Well, last week
he had a not so nice encounter

03:20.867 --> 03:22.902
with a falling air conditioner.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.871
Anyway,

03:24.871 --> 03:27.305
they want you to replace him,
and the money's huge.

03:27.607 --> 03:28.608
Poor Mark.

03:28.608 --> 03:30.877
What a ghastly way to die.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.368
Yes, I cried so hard,
it was all I could do

03:33.880 --> 03:38.384
to stuff your demo tape
in the Fed Ex pouch.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.749
But they want you.

03:40.286 --> 03:42.345
Well, it's very
tempting, Bebe,

03:42.655 --> 03:44.657
but I'm very happy
here in Seattle.

03:44.657 --> 03:45.658
I don't want to leave.

03:45.658 --> 03:48.661
Darling,
it's San Francisco.

03:48.661 --> 03:50.356
Do you know what
life is like there

03:50.663 --> 03:53.366
for a good-looking
straight man?

03:53.366 --> 03:56.665
You'll be like a Snickers bar
at a fat camp.

03:59.939 --> 04:02.942
Eh, no. My answer
is still no, Bebe.

04:02.942 --> 04:04.432
I've got to begin my show.

04:04.944 --> 04:07.947
Well, that's gratitude
for you.

04:07.947 --> 04:09.437
Do you have any idea
the lengths I went to

04:09.949 --> 04:11.451
to make this happen?
Wait a minute.

04:11.451 --> 04:12.819
You were in San Francisco
last week.

04:12.819 --> 04:14.821
Don't tell me...

04:14.821 --> 04:17.824
I was nowhere near
that air conditioner.

04:17.824 --> 04:19.815
You're worse than the police.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.736
We're such a clich?--

04:29.736 --> 04:31.604
little woman at the stove,

04:31.604 --> 04:33.606
big, rugged man
with his brawny arm...

04:33.606 --> 04:36.598
Ooh! The hollandaise
is breaking.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.978
Dad.

04:38.978 --> 04:40.546
I thought you
were going out

04:40.546 --> 04:42.048
with Niles
and Daphne.
I'm waiting on Ronee.

04:42.048 --> 04:44.050
Listen, Charlotte is leaving
for Chicago in three hours.

04:44.050 --> 04:45.485
This is our farewell dinner.

04:45.485 --> 04:47.544
Oh, hi, Martin.
Oh, hi.
How are you?

04:48.054 --> 04:49.555
Don't worry. We're leaving.

04:49.555 --> 04:52.058
I'm not gonna spoil
your romantic mood.

04:52.058 --> 04:55.361
Hey, Ronee,
what, did you fall in?!

04:55.361 --> 04:56.726
(doorbell rings)
Good heavens,
I thought

04:57.430 --> 04:58.731
you were meeting them
downstairs.

04:58.731 --> 05:00.722
That's what I thought, too.

05:01.434 --> 05:02.435
Hey, Martin.

05:02.435 --> 05:03.736
Oh, thank God
you're home, Doc.

05:03.736 --> 05:05.805
I'm going a little crazy--
I need some advice.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.373
Kenny, we just put dinner
on the table.

05:07.373 --> 05:09.876
Oh, thanks, but I'm
too worked up to eat.

05:09.876 --> 05:12.378
Doing your show today,
I... I got the fever.

05:12.378 --> 05:14.380
I want to get back
behind the mike.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.883
But should I quit my job,
throw away my whole career

05:16.883 --> 05:19.886
and financial security
just to chase some
cockamamie dream?

05:19.886 --> 05:22.377
Yes! Off you go.

05:22.889 --> 05:24.891
You didn't even have
to think about it.

05:24.891 --> 05:27.894
You always believed
in me, Doc.

05:27.894 --> 05:29.759
(crying):
Kenny Daly.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.365
Hi. Nice
to meet you.
This, is, uh, Charlotte.

05:32.365 --> 05:33.666
I'm getting
all messy here.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.668
Let me just pop into
the powder room real fast.

05:35.668 --> 05:38.371
g!
MARTIN:
Ronee! While we're youn

05:38.371 --> 05:40.373
Too late.

05:40.373 --> 05:42.041
Well, have a great evening,
you two.

05:42.041 --> 05:43.910
Yes, uh, thank you. Bye.

05:43.910 --> 05:47.413
Oh, damn it, my contact
slipped. Hang on.

05:47.413 --> 05:48.402
KENNY:
Whoa!
Whoa, yourself.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.416
Do we know him?

05:50.416 --> 05:51.781
Knock, knock.
FRASIER:Oh, for God's sake!

05:52.118 --> 05:53.415
No, I know it's
your special night,

05:53.619 --> 05:55.416
but my very pregnant wife
insisted we come up.

05:55.722 --> 05:57.417
Sorry.
Won't be a minute.

05:57.724 --> 05:59.425
KENNY:
Whoa!
Oh, sorry.

05:59.425 --> 06:00.722
I'll just run down the hall.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.595
Maybe I'll start
over on that dinner.

06:02.595 --> 06:03.584
NILES:
I-I'm sorry
for intruding,

06:04.097 --> 06:05.598
but nowadays Daphne
can't go ten minutes.

06:05.598 --> 06:07.600
We're late
for everything.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.102
Yes, well, you
know how Chez Henri hates it

06:09.102 --> 06:10.737
when people are late,
so I'll tell you what,

06:10.737 --> 06:12.500
why don't we call
for that elevator right now.

06:12.638 --> 06:14.440
And tell Henri that
the first round of drinks

06:14.440 --> 06:15.441
is on me.

06:15.441 --> 06:17.744
Whiskey, please.
Simon!

06:17.744 --> 06:19.746
Oh, Frasier! How are you?

06:19.746 --> 06:21.441
Please leave
immediately.
(guffaws)

06:21.581 --> 06:23.139
Hey...

06:23.583 --> 06:25.141
Oh!

06:25.651 --> 06:27.653
There's my little sister.

06:27.653 --> 06:30.156
You're not so little
anymore there, are you?

06:30.156 --> 06:31.646
Simon, what are
you doing here?

06:32.158 --> 06:33.648
Well, I heard
you was knocked up,

06:34.160 --> 06:35.661
so I-I brought you
a present.

06:35.661 --> 06:37.163
Come on in, lads!

06:37.163 --> 06:40.064
Oh, sis!
Oh, my God! Michael!

06:40.466 --> 06:41.524
Hello, sis!

06:41.834 --> 06:43.825
And Stephen!

06:44.537 --> 06:45.805
SIMON:
We knew you'd be here
when we went to your house

06:45.805 --> 06:47.607
and you wasn't there.
So we took the liberty

06:47.607 --> 06:48.908
of leaving our things
in your guest room.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.977
How did you get in?

06:50.977 --> 06:52.569
How did we...

06:56.582 --> 07:00.086
Stephen and Michael,
this is my husband Niles.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.088
Oh, and his brother Frasier.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.090
And this is Martin
and his fiance Ronee.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.025
Hi. How are you?

07:06.025 --> 07:07.527
And, sorry,
your name again?

07:07.527 --> 07:09.518
Kenny.
Kenny.

07:10.029 --> 07:11.531
(thick accent):
So, I'll tell
you what...

07:11.531 --> 07:12.532
(speaking
indecipherable cockney)

07:12.532 --> 07:15.468
I tell you what, he did
bloody well for himself.

07:15.468 --> 07:17.103
SIMON:
That's right, Michael.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.172
Frasier does very well
for himself.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.662
Tell you what,
let's take the tour.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.664
There will be
no tours!

07:23.176 --> 07:25.144
MARTIN:
Listen, uh, why don't you guys
join us for dinner?

07:25.144 --> 07:27.213
I'll lay the table.
Is this real silver?

07:27.213 --> 07:28.981
Give me that!

07:28.981 --> 07:30.539
(speaking
indecipherable cockney)

07:31.050 --> 07:33.519
It's-it's a bloody great
ashtray, isn't it?

07:33.519 --> 07:34.577
(shrieks)

07:35.855 --> 07:39.025
Put that down!

07:39.025 --> 07:40.126
You know, we could have
some real fun

07:40.126 --> 07:41.627
if you got rid
of some of those people.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.629
Oh, just give us
a minute, then, love.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.995
(Charlotte screams)

07:46.566 --> 07:48.668
Who is that creep?!

07:48.668 --> 07:51.728
You know, I'm getting
some very mixed signals.

07:52.071 --> 07:53.172
All right, that's it!

07:53.172 --> 07:54.674
I want you all
out of here!

07:54.674 --> 07:55.675
And I do not mean

07:55.675 --> 07:58.678
a leisurely exit--
I mean a break-neck,

07:58.678 --> 08:01.180
trampling-each-other,
this-theater's-on-
fire stampede!

08:01.180 --> 08:03.671
All right, you know,
I can take a hint,
Frasier, right? Look.

08:04.016 --> 08:06.085
That's a lovely woman
that you've got for yourself.

08:06.085 --> 08:08.187
Congratulations.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, thank you.

08:08.187 --> 08:09.689
Yeah, give us a call.
I'll be at...

08:09.689 --> 08:11.680
Oh, get out of here!

08:13.693 --> 08:15.695
Because it's not a word.

08:15.695 --> 08:16.684
Yes, it is.
No, it's not.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.698
Yes, it is.
Use it in a sentence.

08:18.698 --> 08:21.567
Her grandmother's bed

08:21.567 --> 08:25.938
was warm and quilty.

08:25.938 --> 08:28.608
And why is she
lying there?

08:28.608 --> 08:31.668
Because she's feeling
all "befevered" again?

08:31.878 --> 08:32.945
Could I borrow your 'F'?

08:32.945 --> 08:35.581
I've got a little message for you.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.674
(phone rings)

08:39.684 --> 08:42.688
Hello?

08:42.688 --> 08:44.679
Okay. Thanks.

08:45.091 --> 08:46.559
My car's here.

08:46.559 --> 08:47.293
Mm.

08:47.293 --> 08:48.761
I still don't know why

08:48.761 --> 08:51.264
you won't let me drive you
to the airport.

08:51.264 --> 08:54.267
No. I can't stand all
that airport good-bye stuff.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.935
This is better.
Right.

08:55.935 --> 08:58.037
Well, then...
Look, let's not...

08:58.037 --> 09:00.028
Right, right.
Because...

09:00.740 --> 09:03.042
if you start...
Yeah, me, too.
Okay, uh...

09:03.042 --> 09:05.738
Well, then, uh,
good luck in Chicago.

09:10.149 --> 09:11.138
Thanks.

09:11.651 --> 09:12.640
Got your ticket?
Uh...

09:14.320 --> 09:15.821
Yeah.
Great, great.

09:15.821 --> 09:18.312
Oh, oh, listen,
I have a little
something here for you.

09:18.824 --> 09:21.315
Damn it, I knew you
were gonna do something
sweet like that.

09:21.827 --> 09:22.828
I didn't get you anything.

09:22.828 --> 09:26.232
It's just a hair band
I found in the shower drain.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.801
Thanks.
(chuckles):
Yeah.

09:28.801 --> 09:31.292
Let me get your coat.

09:33.306 --> 09:36.242
This wasn't supposed
to be so hard.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.743
...
I don't know
about you, but

09:37.743 --> 09:40.246
I've had enough easy good-byes.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.248
I'm kind of glad
to have the chance

09:42.248 --> 09:45.240
to have another
tough one.

09:46.752 --> 09:47.753
Thank you

09:47.753 --> 09:50.244
for a great three weeks.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.261
Bye, Charlotte.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.751
Bye, Frasier.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.758
(sighs)

10:08.040 --> 10:09.029
(rapid knocking)

10:11.744 --> 10:13.045
Forgot my scarf.

10:13.045 --> 10:15.036
Oh, oh, my fault.
(chuckles)

10:17.750 --> 10:18.739
All right.

10:21.053 --> 10:22.042
Bye.
Bye.

10:28.761 --> 10:30.763
(rapid knocking)

10:30.763 --> 10:32.064
Cell phone.

10:32.064 --> 10:34.066
Oh! Oh, yes. Here.
Cell phone.

10:34.066 --> 10:35.768
Here you go.

10:35.768 --> 10:37.770
Ow!
Oh!

10:37.770 --> 10:39.405
Oh...
Oh, oh...

10:39.405 --> 10:41.007
I'm sorry.
No, it's...

10:41.007 --> 10:42.708
it's my fault.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.010
Lord...

10:44.010 --> 10:46.012
Ay.

10:46.012 --> 10:48.014
Yeah, uh...
Bye.

10:48.014 --> 10:49.709
See you.
See you.

10:50.016 --> 10:51.711
(groans)

10:55.021 --> 10:56.716
(sighs)

10:58.824 --> 10:59.892
(knocking)

10:59.892 --> 11:02.383
Oh, for God's sake, what now?

11:08.901 --> 11:11.893
We couldn't say good-bye
on a head butt.

11:15.908 --> 11:17.410
Feel better?

11:17.410 --> 11:19.344
Positively quilty.

11:21.000 --> 11:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:34.326 --> 11:35.327
Oh, hey, Niles.

11:35.327 --> 11:36.829
Hi, Dad.

11:36.829 --> 11:37.329
What are you
doing here?

11:37.329 --> 11:39.331
Escaping.

11:39.331 --> 11:40.833
I woke this morning
to find Daphne's brothers

11:40.833 --> 11:43.335
playing a game called
"I Can Reach It From Here. "

11:43.335 --> 11:47.840
Give you a hint--
the "it" was a toilet.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.331
And there were
no winners.

11:52.344 --> 11:54.835
Oh, also I stopped by to see
how Frasier's holding up.

11:55.347 --> 11:57.349
He was asleep when I got home,
and he's still in bed.

11:57.349 --> 11:58.839
He's probably depressed.

11:59.351 --> 12:01.353
I'm sure this whole Charlotte
thing has got him bereft...

12:01.353 --> 12:02.342
Shh, shh.

12:02.855 --> 12:03.856
Morning, Dad.
Hey, Niles.

12:03.856 --> 12:04.845
How's it going
? How you doing?

12:05.357 --> 12:06.346
Let me get you
a cup of coffee.

12:06.859 --> 12:07.860
I can get it.

12:07.860 --> 12:08.849
I brought you some
of those cookies you like.

12:09.361 --> 12:10.362
Milanos.

12:10.362 --> 12:11.351
Oh, well,
thank you.

12:11.864 --> 12:13.299
Now you just
sit down.

12:13.299 --> 12:15.868
I made you
a little breakfast.

12:15.868 --> 12:17.768
I see what's going on.

12:18.137 --> 12:19.905
You think I'm in tatters

12:19.905 --> 12:21.896
because Charlotte's
gone back to Chicago.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.342
Well, I'm not.

12:23.342 --> 12:27.446
I'm not going to say I won't
miss her like crazy.

12:27.446 --> 12:30.449
But we knew going in
that our time was limited.

12:30.449 --> 12:33.452
We made the most of it.
I have no regrets.

12:33.452 --> 12:34.787
Morning.

12:34.787 --> 12:37.056
Except for leaving
that door unlocked.

12:37.056 --> 12:38.523
DAPHNE:
We thought you might

12:38.924 --> 12:40.186
Iike to join us for brunch.

12:40.359 --> 12:44.864
Darn. Niles and I just
reserved a squash court.

12:44.864 --> 12:48.467
Yes, and we're on thin
ice with the appointments
director as it is.

12:48.467 --> 12:49.969
He's already moved
our lockers

12:49.969 --> 12:51.871
next to the
flip-flop drop.

12:51.871 --> 12:57.935
(speaking
indecipherable cockney)

12:58.177 --> 12:59.345
SIMON:
That's right, Michael.

12:59.345 --> 13:02.414
Frasier has a very nice flat,
but you was here last night.

13:02.414 --> 13:04.939
Was I?

13:07.153 --> 13:09.221
Oh, I think I need
to sit down a minute

13:09.221 --> 13:10.210
before we go.

13:10.923 --> 13:13.926
Can you believe this baby
might be two weeks late?

13:13.926 --> 13:15.361
STEPHEN:
He's a Moon all right.

13:15.361 --> 13:18.421
Every lad in our family
was at least two weeks late.

13:18.931 --> 13:21.433
Once we get comfy,
nothing budges us,
right, lads?

13:21.433 --> 13:22.422
Right.

13:22.935 --> 13:25.237
Can I get a glass
of water, please?

13:25.237 --> 13:27.339
Glass of water, yes.

13:27.339 --> 13:28.407
Right, right.

13:28.407 --> 13:31.010
...
Oh, Frasier, be a good lad

13:31.010 --> 13:32.511
(indecipherable)

13:32.511 --> 13:33.500
Right, lads?

13:34.013 --> 13:35.002
Three.

13:39.885 --> 13:42.188
Do you have any idea
what he's saying?

13:42.188 --> 13:44.890
Not a word.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.926
Apparently Stephen was
dropped as a child.

13:46.926 --> 13:48.188
I thought the mumbler was Michael.

13:48.394 --> 13:49.452
He was dropped on Michael.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.133
The idea that our son
might take after them

13:54.133 --> 13:55.835
is making me crazy.

13:55.835 --> 13:56.893
Now, Niles,
just remember

13:57.102 --> 13:59.205
those hearty Crane genes
are in there, too.

13:59.205 --> 14:02.975
Please. Those Moon genes have
probably beaten our genes up

14:02.975 --> 14:04.465
and stolen their lunch money.

14:07.046 --> 14:08.104
That is why I am taking action.

14:08.614 --> 14:10.115
I was going to wait
to do this till tonight,

14:10.115 --> 14:11.605
but I can see that
every minute is critical.

14:12.051 --> 14:13.619
What's this?

14:13.619 --> 14:15.621
This is called
the Born Musician.

14:15.621 --> 14:18.112
You put this speaker
on the mother's stomach,

14:18.624 --> 14:21.126
and it bombards the baby
with classical music,

14:21.126 --> 14:23.495
thus instilling
a taste for higher culture.

14:23.495 --> 14:27.329
The closest thing we had to that
was Dad bongoing out "Babalu"

14:27.867 --> 14:29.494
.
on Mom's belly

14:29.969 --> 14:31.036
Here we are.

14:31.036 --> 14:34.440
Oh, Niles, look what
Stephen just gave me.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.942
You know who'll be jealous?
Mrs. Zicklin from the building.

14:36.942 --> 14:38.410
Doesn't she have
one just like this?

14:38.410 --> 14:39.968
No, I don't think she does.

14:42.581 --> 14:44.640
I brought you
a present, too.

14:45.150 --> 14:47.141
This plays soothing music
for the baby.

14:47.686 --> 14:49.655
You see, you put
this speaker here,

14:49.655 --> 14:51.891
just like that.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.893
And then if you want to hear
a selection of say,

14:53.893 --> 14:55.588
I don't know, Vivaldi,
you turn this dial.

14:55.961 --> 14:57.326
.
And then..

14:59.031 --> 15:03.024
Goodness, he's never
kicked like that before.

15:03.335 --> 15:05.137
We've got a little footballer in the family.

15:05.137 --> 15:07.206
SIMON:
Finally we got
something we can drink to.

15:07.206 --> 15:09.008
MICHAEL:
Let's go to the pub.

15:09.008 --> 15:10.376
(all agreeing)

15:10.376 --> 15:14.380
♪♪ We hate Nottingham Forest♪♪

15:14.380 --> 15:16.075
♪♪ We hate Liverpool, too♪♪

15:16.382 --> 15:17.280
And Leeds!

15:19.218 --> 15:20.986
Are you coming, Martin?
I'm still waiting on Ronee.

15:20.986 --> 15:22.544
We'll meet you
at the restaurant.

15:23.055 --> 15:23.544
Okay.

15:23.956 --> 15:26.025
Marty, I just
got off the phone

15:26.025 --> 15:27.526
with the Branford Inn.

15:27.526 --> 15:31.530
They called to confirm our
wedding reservation for May 1 5.

15:31.530 --> 15:33.532
But we're getting
married July 1 5.

15:33.532 --> 15:35.034
Yes, but they have us
down for May.

15:35.034 --> 15:37.536
Apparently July 1 5 is booked
along with every other weekend

15:37.536 --> 15:38.525
between now and October.

15:38.971 --> 15:40.539
What happened?

15:40.539 --> 15:42.541
I don't know.
You made the reservation.

15:42.541 --> 15:44.076
For July 1 5.

15:44.076 --> 15:45.678
I love how
she blames me.

15:45.678 --> 15:48.681
Why would I randomly pick a...

15:48.681 --> 15:50.683
Oh, no.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.048
FRASIER:
What?

15:52.351 --> 15:55.320
May 1 5-- Eddie's birthday.

15:59.258 --> 16:01.249
Well, I'm sure you
can find someplace else.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.952
We had our hearts set on
the Branford Inn.

16:04.263 --> 16:05.958
It's where we had
our second date.

16:06.265 --> 16:08.256
We had a little
too much wine,

16:08.968 --> 16:10.970
and the couple
at the next table

16:10.970 --> 16:13.165
said, "Get a room, "
and so we did.

16:13.439 --> 16:16.041
Well, I guess I better start
thinking about Plan B.

16:16.041 --> 16:17.042
Damn.

16:17.042 --> 16:18.711
Well, I just feel
sorry for Ronee.

16:18.711 --> 16:21.981
You know, her first wedding
was kind of bare-boned.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.050
That's why she had her heart s
on something special.

16:25.050 --> 16:27.019
You know--

16:27.019 --> 16:31.080
fancy menu, swing band,
flowers everywhere.

16:31.590 --> 16:34.582
You need that once in your life.

16:36.395 --> 16:39.098
You know, Dad, Niles
and I have been wondering

16:39.098 --> 16:40.566
what to get you
for your wedding.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.126
And maybe we could just
give you the wedding.

16:43.235 --> 16:45.294
You still have
the Branford Inn
on the 15th.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.239
But that's eight days away.

16:47.239 --> 16:49.475
You'd have to get a caterer,
a justice of the peace.

16:49.475 --> 16:51.310
I can officiate.

16:51.310 --> 16:52.299
I still have my license
from that time I married

16:53.012 --> 16:54.213
those two commitment-phobes on
my Valentine's show.

16:54.213 --> 16:55.414
Are they still together?

16:55.414 --> 16:56.472
Not the time, Niles.

16:58.250 --> 17:00.319
Ronee, the boys
think they can

17:00.319 --> 17:02.014
throw a fancy wedding
together by May 15th.

17:02.321 --> 17:03.219
But that's
in eight days.

17:03.589 --> 17:05.656
Well, it only took us four days
to throw together

17:05.656 --> 17:08.147
our seafood-themed "Friends
of the Marina Bouilla-bash. "

17:10.162 --> 17:13.165
Well, all right, good.
That's great of you guys.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.132
Thank you.

17:14.633 --> 17:15.601
Well, what
do you know?

17:15.601 --> 17:17.669
Well, leave it
to the duke and duchess

17:17.669 --> 17:19.068
to save our behinds.

17:22.107 --> 17:24.268
I'm sorry.
Leave it to whom?

17:24.476 --> 17:25.577
What, they don't
know about that one?

17:25.577 --> 17:26.566
Just keep walking.

17:31.183 --> 17:32.673
BOTH:
Well, obviously,
you're the duchess...

17:36.088 --> 17:37.356
FRASIER:
Dancers.

17:37.356 --> 17:38.323
(clapping)

17:38.323 --> 17:39.187
Rehearsal is over.

17:39.691 --> 17:41.193
Please wait
upstairs.

17:41.193 --> 17:42.194
I don't want
anyone to see you

17:42.194 --> 17:43.695
until the floor show.

17:43.695 --> 17:45.185
(knocking)

17:47.199 --> 17:49.168
I'm sorry.
We're still setting up.

17:49.168 --> 17:50.430
Clint, would you
please go outside

17:50.669 --> 17:52.271
and tell everyone
they can't come in here

17:52.271 --> 17:53.260
until after the ceremony.

17:53.772 --> 17:55.174
It will spoil
the entire reveal.

17:55.174 --> 17:57.276
You can't blame them.
It's 90 degrees out there.

17:57.276 --> 17:58.766
It's dripping wet.

17:59.278 --> 18:01.769
I hope our Chinese acrobats
are sufficiently rosined.

18:02.147 --> 18:04.216
MARTIN:
Holy mackerel.

18:04.216 --> 18:05.717
You guys
are amazing.

18:05.717 --> 18:08.320
Well, I'm glad you
like it, you two,

18:08.320 --> 18:10.089
but listen, you've
got to go get changed.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.523
You're getting married
in ten minutes.

18:11.523 --> 18:12.624
Traffic was bad--
we got stuck

18:12.624 --> 18:14.353
behind this old bus,
a church group, I think.

18:14.560 --> 18:15.652
Good. Our gospel
choir is here.

18:16.161 --> 18:17.150
Niles, go make
sure they're

18:17.663 --> 18:18.664
fitted with
their angel wings

18:18.664 --> 18:20.165
and give them all
a meal voucher.

18:20.165 --> 18:21.667
(knocking)

18:21.667 --> 18:24.136
ROZ:
Frasier!

18:24.136 --> 18:25.204
Roz, I'm sorry.
I can't let you in.

18:25.204 --> 18:26.193
I know it's warm out there...

18:26.705 --> 18:27.569
Tell you what, go have
a cool drink with Kenny.

18:28.173 --> 18:29.541
I just did.

18:29.541 --> 18:31.099
He told me all about
his new deejay job.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.177
Oh, well, good for him.

18:32.177 --> 18:33.178
I'll come down
and give him a hug.

18:33.178 --> 18:34.680
Well,
bring a towel.

18:34.680 --> 18:35.408
He just sweated
through a hammock.

18:35.681 --> 18:37.282
This sucks.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.184
The softest boss we
ever had is leaving.

18:39.184 --> 18:41.854
Come on, Frasier.
Let me in. It's hot.

18:41.854 --> 18:44.356
All right, Roz.
I can't say I blame you.

18:44.356 --> 18:46.291
It's like the ninth
circle of hell out here.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.694
Do you love
this weather or what?

18:48.694 --> 18:51.263
Bebe, what are you doing here?

18:51.263 --> 18:53.866
Your strategy
worked, you genius.

18:53.866 --> 18:54.730
What strategy?

18:55.234 --> 18:56.502
Turning down
the San Francisco job.

18:56.502 --> 18:58.436
They offered you
20% more money

18:58.770 --> 19:01.773
and thrown in a weekly TV gig
on the morning news.

19:01.773 --> 19:02.865
Television?

19:03.375 --> 19:05.377
Well, that certainly
sounds tempting, but...

19:05.377 --> 19:07.379
but my home is here.

19:07.379 --> 19:09.314
There are more important
things than money.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.216
Yes, I know. There's power,
but money can buy that.

19:11.216 --> 19:12.217
Bebe!

19:12.217 --> 19:13.275
Fine.

19:15.521 --> 19:17.216
If you don't like
the terms of the deal,

19:17.523 --> 19:18.524
I'll have another
swing at it.

19:18.524 --> 19:19.525
Did that old man
just faint?

19:19.525 --> 19:20.389
What?!

19:20.726 --> 19:21.784
Oh, good Lord.

19:22.294 --> 19:24.785
That's my cannon operator.
At the end of the ceremony,

19:25.297 --> 19:26.798
he's supposed to fire
that antique cannon.

19:26.798 --> 19:27.787
I'm not sure there's
anybody else

19:28.300 --> 19:29.301
who knows how to work
the damn thing.

19:29.301 --> 19:30.802
(groans)

19:30.802 --> 19:31.700
Frasier!

19:31.937 --> 19:33.238
Niles!

19:33.238 --> 19:33.939
BOTH:
Disaster!

19:33.939 --> 19:35.240
Dear God. You first.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.808
Our cannon man
is down-- heatstroke.

19:36.808 --> 19:39.208
Our flower girl
is down-- drunk.

19:39.578 --> 19:40.545
The flower girl?

19:40.913 --> 19:42.814
Apparently someone
gave her champagne.

19:42.814 --> 19:45.918
Who would give liquor
to a six-year-old girl?

19:45.918 --> 19:48.487
Party's here, lads.

19:48.487 --> 19:51.490
Simon, did you give our
flower girl champagne?

19:51.490 --> 19:53.481
I may have.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.195
Well, the poor little thing was nervous

19:56.195 --> 19:57.496
about getting
her part right.

19:57.496 --> 19:59.298
Nervous.

19:59.298 --> 20:00.666
Here's our little
ring bearer.

20:00.666 --> 20:02.834
Ronee will be down
in two minutes.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.436
Oh, great.

20:04.436 --> 20:07.272
Still no flower girl, and
now no one to fire our cannon.

20:07.272 --> 20:09.365
Cannon?

20:10.776 --> 20:12.344
If it's a cannon
you need fired,

20:12.344 --> 20:13.333
Michael's your man.

20:13.845 --> 20:14.846
DAPHNE:
Oh, yeah.

20:14.846 --> 20:16.348
He's a great one
for shooting things.

20:16.348 --> 20:18.248
Which foot is it that's
missing two toes?

20:18.450 --> 20:21.520
Um... that one.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.288
All right, then,

20:23.288 --> 20:24.690
come along,
all of you.

20:24.690 --> 20:26.425
See if you can figure
out this thing.

20:26.425 --> 20:28.994
Now, your cue to fire it
is when I say,

20:28.994 --> 20:31.997
at the end of the ceremony,
"Ladies and gentlemen,

20:31.997 --> 20:33.988
Mr. and Mrs. Martin Crane. "
You got it?

20:34.499 --> 20:37.002
(speaking
indecipherable cockney)

20:37.002 --> 20:38.993
Boom.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.543
Is Eddie growling?

20:44.543 --> 20:46.443
It's his stomach. Poor thing
hasn't eaten since morning.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.370
We can't have him
rumbling up the aisle.

20:48.847 --> 20:50.282
Give him some of that pate.

20:50.282 --> 20:51.483
Ooh, Roz,
do you think

20:51.483 --> 20:53.652
that we could enlist Alice to be our flower girl?

20:53.652 --> 20:54.720
What do
you say, honey?
Sure.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.421
Oh, that's splendid news.

20:56.421 --> 20:57.718
Here, take these rose petals.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.425
You're suppose to strew them in the aisle

21:00.425 --> 21:01.727
as you lead the
procession in and out.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.328
NILES:
You know what?

21:03.328 --> 21:05.397
Guess I better
give our ring bearer

21:05.397 --> 21:06.698
his precious cargo.

21:06.698 --> 21:07.687
FRASIER:
Roz!

21:08.400 --> 21:09.389
Her cue to lead
the procession out

21:09.701 --> 21:10.702
at the end of the ceremony

21:10.702 --> 21:12.704
is when I say,
"Ladies and gentlemen,

21:12.704 --> 21:14.706
Mr. and Mrs. Martin Crane. "

21:14.706 --> 21:17.004
(cannon booms)

21:19.011 --> 21:22.347
Not now!

21:22.347 --> 21:25.917
(tires squealing, thud)

21:25.917 --> 21:27.782
What the hell was that?!

21:29.321 --> 21:31.023
What are you
looking for?

21:31.023 --> 21:33.292
The ring.
I dropped it when...

21:33.292 --> 21:34.589
It's in the pate.
Eddie, no!

21:36.862 --> 21:38.864
FRASIER:
Just our luck.

21:38.864 --> 21:41.433
,
When the gun went off,
it startled a truck driver

21:41.433 --> 21:42.422
and he slammed
into a lamppost.

21:42.934 --> 21:44.436
Now the entire
roadway is blocked.

21:44.436 --> 21:46.927
Can anything else
go wrong at this wedding?

21:48.874 --> 21:50.842
What?

21:55.847 --> 21:57.849
There's a veterinarian's
five minutes from here.

21:57.849 --> 21:59.339
I'm sure he can make Eddie
cough up that ring.

21:59.851 --> 22:00.852
All right,
then off you go.

22:00.852 --> 22:01.853
Both of you.
Hurry, please.

22:01.853 --> 22:04.356
We've only got
the skywriter till 5:00.

22:04.356 --> 22:07.092
Clint, could you please

22:07.092 --> 22:09.390
turn up that air conditioning,
to the maximum?

22:09.561 --> 22:10.962
That ice sculpture
over there

22:10.962 --> 22:12.520
is by the renowned artist
Arthur Nudzac

22:13.031 --> 22:14.020
and it's melting already.

22:14.533 --> 22:17.569
(rattling, hissing)

22:17.569 --> 22:19.071
What's that?

22:19.071 --> 22:20.906
We just blew out
the compressor.

22:20.906 --> 22:23.575
Just don't stand there.
Please, call a repairman.

22:23.575 --> 22:25.543
!
.
Frasier... Frasier

22:27.813 --> 22:29.381
You've got to let
these people in.

22:29.381 --> 22:31.883
Yes, Roz, I'm sorry.
I know it's warm...

22:31.883 --> 22:32.884
No, it's not the heat.

22:32.884 --> 22:35.387
That truck that just crashed
was full of cattle.

22:35.387 --> 22:37.378
Well, the sound of gentle
mooing in the background

22:37.889 --> 22:38.890
might lend a pastoral effect.

22:38.890 --> 22:39.879
Cattle,
Frasier.

22:40.392 --> 22:41.893
Large, undiapered cattle

22:41.893 --> 22:44.529
that just heard
a cannon go off.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.898
Oh, all right,
I'll handle this.

22:46.898 --> 22:48.767
Uh, wedding guests,

22:48.767 --> 22:50.535
we thank you
for your cooperation

22:50.535 --> 22:51.536
and your patience...

22:51.536 --> 22:52.833
People, please, please.

22:55.574 --> 22:58.009
Okay, here
are your pills.

22:58.009 --> 22:59.644
Twice a day.

22:59.644 --> 23:02.714
And you feel better,
Mr. Kitty-Cat.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.649
(screeching)

23:04.649 --> 23:06.151
?
.
Who's next

23:06.151 --> 23:07.419
I am.

23:07.419 --> 23:09.421
Oh, gosh.

23:09.421 --> 23:10.410
NILES:
Um, actually,

23:10.622 --> 23:11.690
we have an
emergency here.

23:11.690 --> 23:12.557
Our dog
swallowed a ring

23:12.557 --> 23:13.892
and it's holding up
a whole wedding.

23:13.892 --> 23:14.859
Go ahead. I can wait.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.752
Thank you so much.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.595
Thank you.

23:20.832 --> 23:23.902
Boy, no easy cases today.

23:23.902 --> 23:25.893
Talk about hitting
the ground running.

23:26.605 --> 23:27.606
Is this your first day?

23:27.606 --> 23:29.471
Yep. I'm not i
n Kansas anymore.

23:29.641 --> 23:31.438
Where'd you go
to vet school?

23:31.476 --> 23:33.068
Kansas.

23:33.612 --> 23:34.980
All right.
Here we go.

23:34.980 --> 23:36.481
Hold his mouth open.

23:36.481 --> 23:38.984
I'll see if I can get
his paw down his throat.

23:38.984 --> 23:40.519
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

23:40.519 --> 23:41.987
Why don't I just take your pooch

23:41.987 --> 23:44.055
.
to the other room here
and I'll be right back

23:44.055 --> 23:46.558
Excuse me. Thank you.
All right, buddy.

23:46.558 --> 23:49.789
Thank you. Thank you.

23:50.028 --> 23:52.121
He has no idea
what he's doing.

23:52.531 --> 23:55.100
He's just new at this.
He's nervous.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.102
I've been a bit
nervous meself lately.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.603
Ever since me brothers
showed up.

23:58.603 --> 24:00.639
Really? Why?

24:00.639 --> 24:02.007
Well, you know,
the way they keep

24:02.007 --> 24:03.008
patting my stomach
and saying

24:03.008 --> 24:04.009
"
.
"He's a Moon all right

24:04.009 --> 24:06.011
Oh, my God, yes.

24:06.011 --> 24:07.512
And every time
they say that,

24:07.512 --> 24:10.081
all I can think is
what if he's not?

24:10.081 --> 24:12.072
What if he's like
you and Frasier?

24:14.986 --> 24:16.488
Excuse me?

24:16.488 --> 24:19.558
A Moon boy I know
how to handle.

24:19.558 --> 24:21.860
But what if he'?
a little genius,

24:21.860 --> 24:23.760
teasing me in Frensix?
by the time he's

24:24.129 --> 24:26.198
I've been worried
he's going to turn out

24:26.198 --> 24:27.699
Iike one of your brothers.

24:27.699 --> 24:30.202
I was sure when he kicked
that speaker off your belly

24:30.202 --> 24:32.204
that you had
a little Simon in there.

24:32.204 --> 24:33.694
They are a handful,
my brothers.

24:34.206 --> 24:35.707
I can just imagine
the hell they're
raising back there.

24:35.707 --> 24:37.676
With an open bar?

24:37.676 --> 24:38.665
Oh, my God!

24:39.177 --> 24:41.042
My water just broke.
The baby's coming.

24:41.580 --> 24:42.979
Because I said "open bar"?

24:43.682 --> 24:44.671
Oh!

24:44.916 --> 24:45.984
All right, okay,
all right.

24:45.984 --> 24:46.973
Don't, don't panic.

24:47.686 --> 24:48.987
There's plenty of time
to get you to a hospital.

24:48.987 --> 24:49.855
The hell there is!
He's coming right now.

24:49.855 --> 24:51.156
Here's your ring.

24:51.156 --> 24:54.159
Call an ambulance.
My wife's having a baby.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.160
There's no time
for an ambulance.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.161
(gasping)

24:56.161 --> 24:57.596
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

24:57.596 --> 24:59.698
You know what?
You call 91 1,

24:59.698 --> 25:00.995
and I'll just
get started here.

25:01.700 --> 25:01.995
Wait, wait, wait.

25:02.601 --> 25:03.702
I'm going to wash
my hands.

25:03.702 --> 25:06.004
(gasping)

25:06.004 --> 25:07.839
Are you sure
you know what
you're doing?

25:07.839 --> 25:09.602
Oh, I've assisted in many
deliveries, ma'am.

25:09.908 --> 25:11.910
One just took blue rib
bon at the Kansas State Fair.

25:11.910 --> 25:12.911
Oh, my God!

25:12.911 --> 25:14.913
Easy now. You'
re doing great, girI.

25:14.913 --> 25:17.282
Don't call me that!
I'm not a bloody poodle.

25:17.282 --> 25:18.579
Yes, hello, hello.

25:18.850 --> 25:21.553
We're at... We're at
1206 East Village Road.

25:21.553 --> 25:23.214
My wife's gone into labor.

25:23.588 --> 25:24.990
They say the hospital
is 20 miles away.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.691
Can you make it
if I drive you?

25:26.691 --> 25:26.992
(yells)

25:26.992 --> 25:29.861
She says no.

25:29.861 --> 25:32.197
All right, they're on their wa
They're on their way.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.563
Now you just calm down.
Focus on me and breathe.

25:38.870 --> 25:39.859
(wheezing)

25:41.806 --> 25:44.876
Oh, for God's sakes!
Oh! Oh!

25:44.876 --> 25:46.578
Is everything okay in here?

25:46.578 --> 25:48.313
.
We're fine

25:48.313 --> 25:50.815
Okay. If you need any help,
I'm a registered nurse.

25:50.815 --> 25:51.616
Get the hell back in here!

25:51.616 --> 25:52.947
Easy, girl.

25:53.652 --> 25:54.641
Stop that!

25:56.821 --> 25:58.189
Roz, do not open a window

25:58.189 --> 26:00.692
until they tow
that cattle truck!

26:00.692 --> 26:02.182
.
Oh, my God.
It's a million degrees in here

26:02.694 --> 26:04.129
We got to get
a breeze going.

26:04.129 --> 26:05.721
(all gagging)

26:06.031 --> 26:09.601
Oh, my God!

26:09.601 --> 26:11.736
Dad, Ronee,
we're almost ready to start.

26:11.736 --> 26:12.862
What's that smell?

26:13.038 --> 26:14.105
Smell?

26:14.105 --> 26:16.972
Congratulations, you two.
Everything's just perfect.

26:17.676 --> 26:18.577
.
Sorry I can't stay

26:18.577 --> 26:20.345
What's happening?

26:20.345 --> 26:21.913
There's been a bit
of a mishap

26:21.913 --> 26:23.778
with a cattle truck,
and the AC's out.

26:23.982 --> 26:26.051
But no matter. Right, people?

26:26.051 --> 26:28.253
It'll take more than that to mar our joy

26:28.253 --> 26:31.823
in seeing these two become
Mr. and Mrs. Martin Crane.

26:31.823 --> 26:33.723
(cannon booming)

26:34.059 --> 26:35.993
(cell phone ringing)

26:36.261 --> 26:38.330
Hello.

26:38.330 --> 26:39.831
Well, finally, Niles.

26:39.831 --> 26:41.333
Stop babbling.

26:41.333 --> 26:42.823
.
Niles, you'll have to speak up

26:43.335 --> 26:45.837
I can't hear you with that bab
screaming in the backgrou...

26:45.837 --> 26:47.327
Oh, my God!

26:51.710 --> 26:53.701
Isn't he perfect, Dad?

26:54.112 --> 26:55.670
He certainly is, Mom.

26:56.181 --> 26:58.683
He's got your eyes
and my chin.

26:58.683 --> 26:59.672
He's got my hair.

27:00.185 --> 27:01.186
Do you think so?

27:01.186 --> 27:02.687
No, he's got my hair.

27:02.687 --> 27:04.177
Let go, dear.

27:04.756 --> 27:07.158
If you can part with him
for just two seconds,

27:07.158 --> 27:08.660
I should finish
cleaning him up.

27:08.660 --> 27:10.295
Of course.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.855
We can't thank
you two enough.

27:13.365 --> 27:14.366
Oh, please.

27:14.366 --> 27:17.130
Really. If there's ever anything
that we can do for you.

27:17.335 --> 27:18.393
You can do me
one quick favor.

27:18.837 --> 27:21.397
My Jason is kinda overdue
for his lunch.

27:21.906 --> 27:23.305
Of course.

27:24.743 --> 27:28.246
Hello? Niles?

27:28.246 --> 27:29.247
Boy, some day, huh?

27:29.247 --> 27:31.750
Getting married
and meeting my grandson

27:31.750 --> 27:33.184
all in the same
afternoon.

27:33.184 --> 27:35.243
Hey, you guys,
you're just in time.

27:35.754 --> 27:36.743
Come on in.

27:42.827 --> 27:43.885
Don't stare.

27:44.396 --> 27:46.864
You were no prize
at that age either.

27:48.867 --> 27:52.237
Oh, look who's her
e. Hello.

27:52.237 --> 27:53.238
Here we go.

27:53.238 --> 27:56.808
Oh, my God.
He's beautiful.

27:56.808 --> 28:01.279
That twin's gonna be jealous
his whole life.

28:01.279 --> 28:02.871
Your ambulance should
be here any minute,

28:03.348 --> 28:04.337
so I think
I'm going to go.

28:04.849 --> 28:06.851
All right. Here.
Thank you again.

28:06.851 --> 28:07.715
You sure you don't want me
to check your monkey?

28:07.986 --> 28:10.755
Yeah, I'm sure.

28:10.755 --> 28:11.823
Congratulations.

28:11.823 --> 28:12.390
Thank you.
Thank you.

28:12.390 --> 28:14.392
Hey there, you.

28:14.392 --> 28:18.385
I'm the one who's
gonna spoil you rotten.

28:18.830 --> 28:20.398
You're so sweet to come down,

28:20.398 --> 28:22.400
but what about your wedding,
all those people?

28:22.400 --> 28:23.389
Ah, they'll keep.

28:23.735 --> 28:25.202
Yeah, as long as there's
an open bar.

28:25.470 --> 28:27.938
Ooh! Settle down there.

28:34.212 --> 28:35.280
(siren wailing)

28:35.280 --> 28:36.848
I guess
that's our ride.

28:36.848 --> 28:38.850
I'm so sorry we're going
to miss your wedding.

28:38.850 --> 28:41.086
So are we.

28:41.086 --> 28:43.855
I feel like it's
me own dad getting married.

28:43.855 --> 28:46.157
It's not going to be the
same without you guys up there.

28:46.157 --> 28:47.852
I don 't want
to forget the rings.

28:48.159 --> 28:50.161
Hey, wait a minute.

28:50.161 --> 28:52.163
Why don't we just
get married here?

28:52.163 --> 28:54.757
We've got the rings
and the preacher.

28:54.866 --> 28:56.367
What about
all the guests?

28:56.367 --> 28:58.436
We can do it again
for them later.

28:58.436 --> 29:00.927
And at least this place
only smells like a monkey.

29:01.372 --> 29:04.442
.
Well, I'm game

29:04.442 --> 29:05.910
Get crackin', Fras.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.980
You know, I'm gonna
condense this just a bit.

29:08.980 --> 29:11.471
I don't need that.
And I don't need that.

29:11.983 --> 29:15.487
Ah. "It was the great thinker
Horace Walpole... "

29:15.487 --> 29:18.323
Don't need that.

29:18.323 --> 29:21.359
Well, all right then. Uh...

29:21.359 --> 29:22.260
Dearly beloved...

29:22.260 --> 29:23.921
Someone call for an ambulance?

29:24.195 --> 29:26.527
Just a couple of seconds,
please.

29:26.898 --> 29:29.801
Niles, why don't
you give them the rings?

29:29.801 --> 29:31.792
Cut to the chase here.

29:32.303 --> 29:35.306
Do you, Martin Crane,
take Ronee Lawrence

29:35.306 --> 29:37.408
to be your lawfully wedded wife,

29:37.408 --> 29:41.279
forsaking all others
until death do you part?

29:41.279 --> 29:43.982
I do.

29:43.982 --> 29:46.551
Do you, Ronee Lawrence,
take Martin Crane...

29:46.551 --> 29:47.518
I do.

29:47.919 --> 29:49.988
.
Oh, I'm tearing up

29:49.988 --> 29:51.990
If they'd let me say
what I planned to,

29:51.990 --> 29:55.994
you'd be bawling
your eyes out right now.

29:55.994 --> 29:58.062
By the power vested in me,

29:58.062 --> 30:00.031
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

30:00.031 --> 30:03.023
NILES:
Yay!

30:03.334 --> 30:04.301
(applause)

30:07.872 --> 30:09.507
We're ready now.

30:09.507 --> 30:12.577
We're so happy
for you both.

30:12.577 --> 30:14.579
Congratulations.

30:14.579 --> 30:16.080
And you will always remember
your anniversary

30:16.080 --> 30:18.349
because it's the same day
as your grandson's birthday.

30:18.349 --> 30:21.019
Yeah, and Eddie's.

30:21.019 --> 30:21.883
What?

30:23.621 --> 30:25.190
Never mind.

30:25.190 --> 30:26.891
Eddie's birthday is today?

30:26.891 --> 30:30.128
So that's how you came up
with May 15th for the hotel?

30:30.128 --> 30:31.196
Uh...

30:31.196 --> 30:32.463
I knew it.

30:32.463 --> 30:35.057
And you've been blaming
the inn all this time.

30:35.533 --> 30:36.522
You are so busted.

30:39.003 --> 30:41.062
That was a short honeymoon.

31:09.033 --> 31:11.536
Hello, Lilith.
Hey. It's me.

31:11.536 --> 31:14.038
Yeah, listen, I was just calling
to check out how Freddy's doing.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.540
What? A new one?

31:15.540 --> 31:18.543
I thought he was smitten
with the old one.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.044
Well, you know,
he gets that from me.

31:20.044 --> 31:21.033
Back in my heyday,

31:21.546 --> 31:24.549
I had a new chess coach
every month.

31:24.549 --> 31:27.609
Well, I'm spending
a lot of time alone lately.

31:28.119 --> 31:31.623
Oh, you know, Dad and Ronee
are still on their honeymoon.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.625
Oh, yes, they thank you
for that very thoughtful

31:33.625 --> 31:36.492
radon detector you sent.

31:36.928 --> 31:39.097
Not seeing much of Niles
and Daphne either

31:39.097 --> 31:41.156
because they're so busy
with the baby.

31:41.499 --> 31:43.568
Oh, sorry to keep you.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.070
Just tell Freddy to call me.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.560
Okay, bye, Lilith.

32:00.084 --> 32:02.075
(doorbell rings)

32:07.091 --> 32:08.092
Oh.

32:08.092 --> 32:10.094
Here to pick up a chair.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.095
It's right there.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.096
Sorry I'm late.
It's all right.

32:12.096 --> 32:13.097
Been waiting long?

32:13.097 --> 32:14.587
1 1 years.

32:21.172 --> 32:22.969
Be careful with it.

32:53.171 --> 32:54.160
(sighs)

33:12.423 --> 33:14.425
Bebe, hi. It's Frasier.

33:14.425 --> 33:18.725
Listen, about that
San Francisco job.

33:19.263 --> 33:20.730
I think I'll take it.

33:29.007 --> 33:31.305
?
.
Have you heard anything,
Frasier?About what

33:32.010 --> 33:34.012
The new station manager
they're announcing today.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.014
My stomach is in knots.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.415
I just know
they're going to replace

33:37.415 --> 33:41.146
sweet, kind-hearted Kenny
with some ruthless, draconian...

33:41.386 --> 33:42.587
Hard ass.

33:42.587 --> 33:45.147
That would hardly
make up for it.

33:48.292 --> 33:49.794
Frasier.

33:49.794 --> 33:51.295
Bebe. Oh...

33:51.295 --> 33:53.798
I'll let you know if
I hear anything, guys.

33:53.798 --> 33:55.299
It's done.

33:55.299 --> 33:57.301
When destiny calls,
Bebe calls back

33:57.301 --> 33:59.303
and screws destiny
to the wall.

33:59.303 --> 34:01.806
Yes, yes, yes. Shh.
I don't want anyone to find out.

34:01.806 --> 34:03.296
I'm not telling my family
until this evening.

34:05.309 --> 34:07.812
I'm so proud of you.

34:07.812 --> 34:11.315
Bebe, listen, I have
something for you.

34:11.315 --> 34:12.817
I've decided to give away
some of the things

34:12.817 --> 34:15.308
I've accumulated
through the years.

34:15.820 --> 34:19.824
Sort of a fresh start,
you know.

34:19.824 --> 34:22.621
.
My baby's all grown up

34:25.228 --> 34:26.525
I look in your eyes
and I see something there

34:27.231 --> 34:28.527
that I've never seen before.

34:29.233 --> 34:30.534
Wisdom?

34:30.534 --> 34:31.467
Crow's feet.

34:33.471 --> 34:36.174
Sorry, darling, but you're
going to be on TV now.

34:36.174 --> 34:38.476
I talked to my face man.
He can see you at 4:00.

34:38.476 --> 34:40.478
Well, thanks, Bebe, but, no.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.480
I'm not talking surgery,
just a little tweaking.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.181
20 minutes.
I've used him for years.

34:44.181 --> 34:45.483
And I'm sure he's very good
at what he does,

34:45.483 --> 34:47.185
but still it's just...

34:47.185 --> 34:49.176
I'm done next door, so
I'll be in the car, Mom.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.122
4:00 it is.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.136
Yeah.

35:05.136 --> 35:06.437
Thank you.

35:06.437 --> 35:08.132
Bye.

35:10.441 --> 35:12.443
You heard something,
didn't you?

35:12.443 --> 35:13.432
Yeah.

35:14.145 --> 35:15.446
Roz, are you
all right?
Of course not.

35:15.446 --> 35:18.449
She's ashen with terror.
Spit it out, Roz.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.144
Who's the
jack-booted tyrant

35:20.451 --> 35:23.154
whose fanny I'll be kissing till God knows when?

35:23.154 --> 35:25.156
Me.

35:25.156 --> 35:28.353
Joyful news, Your Majesty.

35:28.559 --> 35:30.628
You?

35:30.628 --> 35:33.131
Roz, congratulatio
ns. Aren't you excited?

35:33.131 --> 35:35.133
I don't know. I...
It just hasn't sunk in yet.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.134
That's understandable.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.624
I remember when I
heard that my advice

35:38.136 --> 35:39.137
...
would be heard by
millions of people

35:39.137 --> 35:41.230
It just sunk in!
I'm the boss!

35:41.405 --> 35:43.174
Who wants to go have champagne?

35:43.174 --> 35:44.475
Oh, gosh, Roz,
I'd love to,

35:44.475 --> 35:45.476
but I have to go to
a doctor's appointment.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.171
Can you come to my place
for dinner tonight?

35:47.478 --> 35:49.180
Sure.

35:49.180 --> 35:51.478
I'm so happy for
you.
I'm just so excited.

35:57.722 --> 36:00.213
(breathing heavily)

36:09.734 --> 36:12.726
Well, was that worth
waiting for?

36:13.337 --> 36:17.296
He asked you
a question, Roz.

36:23.447 --> 36:24.916
Bebe, it's Frasier.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.417
When you get this,
call me please.

36:26.417 --> 36:27.818
I want to thank you
for sending me

36:27.818 --> 36:29.820
to that quack of yours today.

36:29.820 --> 36:33.654
He screwed something up and now
my eyes won't stop watering.

36:33.891 --> 36:35.960
There she is.

36:35.960 --> 36:37.461
Congratulations.

36:37.461 --> 36:39.452
And to you.

36:39.897 --> 36:41.489
Hey, does anyone know
what this big occasion is?

36:41.966 --> 36:43.467
We had plans
and Frasier made us cancel.

36:43.467 --> 36:44.969
We're not sure either.

36:44.969 --> 36:46.337
He said he had some sort
of an announcement to make.

36:46.337 --> 36:47.304
Hey, Roz.

36:47.805 --> 36:50.296
Aw, there he is.

36:50.808 --> 36:51.797
Oh!

36:53.911 --> 36:56.480
Hey, David...

36:56.480 --> 36:59.483
Remember me?
I'm your grandpa.

36:59.483 --> 37:01.485
Yes, and I'm your...

37:01.485 --> 37:03.976
Sorry. I just...
I can't say it yet.

37:04.388 --> 37:06.481
Frasier, I brought
some champagne if...

37:06.791 --> 37:07.849
Were you just crying?

37:08.359 --> 37:09.994
No. No, Roz,
of course not.

37:09.994 --> 37:11.562
Could you take
these out for me?

37:11.562 --> 37:13.257
Sure.
Thank you.

37:15.466 --> 37:18.502
Is Frasier okay?

37:18.502 --> 37:20.493
Sure. Why?

37:20.571 --> 37:22.640
Well, I think he was crying
in the kitchen.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.342
I hope he's okay.

37:24.342 --> 37:25.502
He's been to the doctor
an awful lot lately.

37:25.843 --> 37:27.310
Has he?

37:27.578 --> 37:30.348
Yeah. He went today.
And he missed a whole show

37:30.348 --> 37:32.016
because of an appointment
last week.

37:32.016 --> 37:33.745
He hasn't said anything to us.

37:34.385 --> 37:35.353
Ronee,

37:35.353 --> 37:38.923
I saw you admiring
this china pattern.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.322
Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.

37:40.491 --> 37:43.551
Well, I'd like to make
a gift of them to you.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.563
There's a complete set.

37:45.563 --> 37:46.931
Gosh, Frasier.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.466
Thank you.

37:48.466 --> 37:49.967
Oh, Niles...

37:49.967 --> 37:52.036
I know how much
you've always coveted

37:52.036 --> 37:54.538
this chess set.

37:54.538 --> 37:56.040
I want you to have it.

37:56.040 --> 37:57.541
But this is your favorite.

37:57.541 --> 37:59.043
This is the one
you learned on.

37:59.043 --> 38:00.544
Which is why I want
it to be the set

38:00.544 --> 38:02.535
that you teach that son
of yours to play on.

38:04.548 --> 38:06.317
I haven't forgotten
about you, Roz.

38:06.317 --> 38:07.614
I'll be right back.

38:09.620 --> 38:10.888
I don't like this.

38:10.888 --> 38:12.690
Well, now let'
s not get alarmed.

38:12.690 --> 38:14.692
Marriage in the air
and a new baby...

38:14.692 --> 38:16.661
it's just brought out
his sentimental side.

38:16.661 --> 38:18.458
(telephone rings)

38:23.434 --> 38:24.735
(over answering machine):
Frasier, it's Dr. Hanning.

38:24.735 --> 38:26.600
I'm really sorry
about your results.

38:26.804 --> 38:29.068
I know it doesn't look good,

38:29.440 --> 38:30.741
but I'm going to do everything l can for you.

38:30.741 --> 38:32.606
Call me.

38:32.843 --> 38:34.333
(beep)

38:36.447 --> 38:37.648
Oh, my God.

38:37.648 --> 38:40.551
You think that's why he
brought us all here tonight?

38:40.551 --> 38:41.952
Here we are, Roz.

38:41.952 --> 38:45.489
I thought this art deco mirror
seemed like you.

38:45.489 --> 38:49.360
(cries)

38:49.360 --> 38:50.554
That just shows you.

38:51.062 --> 38:54.332
I thought I'd get
the bigger reaction
from the chess set.

38:54.332 --> 38:57.435
Frasier, what'
s going on here?

38:57.435 --> 38:58.669
Yeah, giving all
your stuff away...

38:58.669 --> 39:01.739
you're not going
anywhere, are you?

39:01.739 --> 39:04.475
Well, I didn't want to say
anything until after dinner,

39:04.475 --> 39:06.577
so as not to bring down
the party, but...

39:06.577 --> 39:07.635
(groans)

39:09.480 --> 39:11.916
I see you're
all ahead of me.

39:11.916 --> 39:16.353
Listen, a couple of weeks ago
I got some unexpected news.

39:16.787 --> 39:18.755
(sobs)

39:19.023 --> 39:22.093
Now, you see, this
is exactly what I
was trying to avoid.

39:22.093 --> 39:25.830
You mustn't think
of my leaving you
as a sad thing,

39:25.830 --> 39:27.365
because I don't.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.400
I think of it as an adventure.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.802
(cries):
Oh, Frasier, no...

39:31.802 --> 39:33.838
Look, we all knew we weren't
going to stay together forever.

39:33.838 --> 39:35.533
That's not what life is about.

39:35.806 --> 39:39.367
Cry if you must,
but I assure you

39:39.443 --> 39:43.504
when I pass through that
Golden Gate, I will be smiling.

39:45.649 --> 39:47.418
..
(choked up):
Golden gate.

39:47.418 --> 39:48.419
Yes.

39:48.419 --> 39:50.717
That's where I'm moving
to, San Francisco.

39:52.757 --> 39:53.849
What?

39:54.525 --> 39:55.559
My new job.

39:55.559 --> 39:57.661
I start next week.

39:57.661 --> 40:00.164
Now don't just sit there
choking back the tears.

40:00.164 --> 40:01.654
Go ahead. Let them out.

40:03.167 --> 40:05.431
I can't believe it!
(laughing)

40:09.173 --> 40:10.674
To San Francisco.

40:10.674 --> 40:12.164
To San Francisco.
To San Francisco.

40:20.184 --> 40:21.685
You know, it's just
an hour by plane,

40:21.685 --> 40:24.188
so I'll be coming back up
as often as you like.

40:24.188 --> 40:25.689
Oh, we know, Fras.
Don't worry about us.

40:25.689 --> 40:27.179
We're happy for you.

40:27.691 --> 40:30.194
I'm happy for myself...

40:30.194 --> 40:33.197
and scared, too.
But it's a good scared.

40:33.197 --> 40:36.189
Sort of the way I felt
when I came here from Boston.

40:36.700 --> 40:38.202
But if I hadn't done that,

40:38.202 --> 40:40.693
.
just look at what
I would've missed out on

40:41.205 --> 40:43.207
And...

40:43.207 --> 40:46.699
Iook what I would've missed out on.

40:47.211 --> 40:49.580
God, they are
so beautiful.

40:49.580 --> 40:51.048
And they'll stay like that

40:51.048 --> 40:53.039
as long as she keeps
breast-feeding.

40:58.522 --> 41:02.526
Niles, could you take the baby?
I need to get a blanket.

41:02.526 --> 41:03.515
Sure.

41:10.501 --> 41:14.062
.
This is pretty comfortable.
I would've been okay with this

41:20.478 --> 41:23.470
Let me just help you
with some of those dishes.

41:25.916 --> 41:27.747
Oh, handsome boy.

41:28.252 --> 41:29.520
Yes.

41:29.520 --> 41:33.624
And to think I had myself
all worked up

41:33.624 --> 41:35.759
worrying that we would have
nothing in common.

41:35.759 --> 41:38.529
Oh, I've been there, Niles.

41:38.529 --> 41:40.087
It all works out.

41:42.867 --> 41:44.602
Well, Marty,
we better get going.

41:44.602 --> 41:46.537
I got a crazy
morning.

41:46.537 --> 41:48.606
Me, too.
I've got a 7:30 meeting

41:48.606 --> 41:50.608
and then I've got
to fire someone.

41:50.608 --> 41:51.597
Who?

41:51.909 --> 41:53.900
Whoever scheduled
the 7:30 meeting.

41:55.546 --> 41:56.604
We should go, too, honey.

41:57.114 --> 41:58.581
If you really must
go, all right,

41:59.116 --> 42:00.584
but I'll tell you what.

42:00.584 --> 42:02.119
Don't go without taking some
of these eclairs with you.

42:02.119 --> 42:03.587
I'm on TV next week.

42:03.587 --> 42:05.111
The only thing worse
than them go to waste

42:05.589 --> 42:07.580
would be seeing them
go to my waist.

42:08.125 --> 42:10.685
(chuckles)

42:12.062 --> 42:13.029
What?

42:13.531 --> 42:17.167
It just hit me.
You're really leaving.

42:17.167 --> 42:20.967
What will I ever do
without you?

42:21.305 --> 42:24.240
You're the sweetest,
most wonderful...

42:24.642 --> 42:26.610
It's okay, Roz.
He's not going till next week.

42:26.610 --> 42:28.043
Let her talk, Dad.

42:30.247 --> 42:33.551
You've always been
just like a brother to me.

42:33.551 --> 42:35.853
Which is weird, I know,
because we slept together,

42:35.853 --> 42:36.842
but... well, you know.

42:38.889 --> 42:40.948
Oh, move over, Roz.

42:43.327 --> 42:45.318
You know how many operas
I'm going to get dragged to

42:45.796 --> 42:46.931
now you're not around?

42:46.931 --> 42:50.890
I promise I'll fly up
for all the German ones.

42:51.168 --> 42:53.737
And he'll be here for Christmas
and Thanksgiving and birthdays.

42:53.737 --> 42:55.728
We'll be sick of this guy.
Dad's right.

42:56.106 --> 42:58.768
Once I'm gone, there'?
I be no getting rid of me.

42:58.842 --> 42:59.934
(chuckles)

43:02.913 --> 43:04.608
Thank you, Frasier,

43:04.915 --> 43:07.748
for... well, you know.

43:13.123 --> 43:14.613
Go get 'em, kid.
Sure.

43:17.628 --> 43:19.630
You already made me
cry once tonight.

43:19.630 --> 43:21.598
That's quite enough.

43:21.799 --> 43:23.767
Right. Coffee tomorrow?

43:23.867 --> 43:25.960
10:30.

43:26.637 --> 43:28.662
I'll miss the coffees.

43:31.875 --> 43:34.144
Now, look...

43:34.144 --> 43:36.203
you all know
how I feel about you.

43:39.316 --> 43:40.851
The only reason
I'm leaving is because

43:40.851 --> 43:45.345
I want what all of you
have now, a new chapter.

43:46.824 --> 43:49.326
Who knows if it'll
even work out?

43:49.326 --> 43:52.329
But it's like that Tennyson po
Mom had us recite for you

43:52.329 --> 43:54.331
when we were kids.
You remember?

43:54.331 --> 43:57.868
I think we're about to.

43:57.868 --> 44:03.307
"It may be the gulfs
will wash us down,

44:03.307 --> 44:07.244
"It may be we shall touch
the happy isles,

44:07.244 --> 44:08.711
"And though we are not now
that strength

44:09.146 --> 44:13.640
"which in old days
moved earth and heaven,

44:13.951 --> 44:16.854
"That which we are, we are...

44:16.854 --> 44:20.858
"...Made weak by time and fate,

44:20.858 --> 44:23.360
"but strong in will

44:23.360 --> 44:29.733
"To strive, to seek, to find,

44:29.733 --> 44:32.201
and not to yield. "

44:35.839 --> 44:40.377
I've been thinking about
that poem a lot lately.

44:40.377 --> 44:42.312
And I think what it says

44:42.312 --> 44:45.082
is that while it's tempting to play it safe,

44:45.082 --> 44:48.779
the more we're willing to risk
the more alive we are.

44:49.086 --> 44:52.790
In the end, what we regret most

44:52.790 --> 44:56.093
are the chances we never took.

44:56.093 --> 44:59.096
And I hope that explains,
at least a little,

44:59.096 --> 45:04.101
this journey on which
I'm about to embark.

45:04.101 --> 45:08.806
I have loved every minute

45:08.806 --> 45:12.105
with my KACL family
and all of you.

45:16.113 --> 45:21.118
For 1 1 years you've heard
me say, "I'm listening. "

45:21.118 --> 45:24.788
Well, you were listening, too.

45:24.788 --> 45:27.757
And for that
I am eternally grateful.

45:30.861 --> 45:32.920
Good night, Seattle.

45:35.933 --> 45:37.924
We had a big party that nigh
t. It was all very sweet.

45:38.235 --> 45:38.929
(small thud)

45:39.236 --> 45:40.237
What was that?

45:40.237 --> 45:41.939
Oh, good heavens.

45:41.939 --> 45:42.940
We've touched down.

45:42.940 --> 45:44.942
Already?

45:44.942 --> 45:47.911
Well, thank you so much.
I've never had an easier flight.

45:47.911 --> 45:51.074
And I've never had m
ore delightful company.

45:51.482 --> 45:54.318
I think it's great
what you're doing.

45:54.318 --> 45:56.086
it
Well, I just know
I'd always regret

45:56.086 --> 45:57.988
if I didn't take the chance.

45:57.988 --> 46:02.826
FLIGHT A TTENDANT:
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Chicago.

46:02.826 --> 46:05.395
Wish me luck.
