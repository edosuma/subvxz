WEBVTT

00:14.514 --> 00:18.643
[chuckles] I guess when we said
we were gonna be friends,

00:18.726 --> 00:19.894
we were both full of shit.

00:21.521 --> 00:23.022
-We are friends.
-Oh, yeah?

00:23.106 --> 00:26.109
This is how you said goodbye to Dale
the last time he came over?

00:27.194 --> 00:28.403
-No.
-[sighs]

00:28.486 --> 00:31.573
-I asked him to give a cow an enema.
-[chuckles]

00:32.240 --> 00:33.325
So, what now?

00:34.242 --> 00:35.660
Uh, I don't know.

00:35.743 --> 00:37.579
We said we weren't gonna kiss,
and we did,

00:37.662 --> 00:40.373
so maybe, along those lines,
we should not go to Hawaii?

00:40.457 --> 00:42.084
[both chuckle]

00:42.167 --> 00:45.128
Hey, Beau, do you ever think
maybe we're going too fast?

00:45.212 --> 00:46.338
[chuckles]

00:46.421 --> 00:49.382
I'm 71. Nothing moves fast.

00:50.049 --> 00:52.469
I'm just sayin', we've...
we've never gone to dinner,

00:52.552 --> 00:54.304
we've never gone dancing...

00:54.387 --> 00:55.847
and you've never met my horses.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.975
-You have horses?
-Two. Butch and Sundance.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.479
You shouldn't tell me stuff like that
if you don't want me to kiss you again.

01:03.938 --> 01:05.107
But I hear you.

01:05.982 --> 01:07.984
If we're gonna do this,
we should do it right.

01:08.901 --> 01:12.572
-I should court you.
-[chuckles] Court me? Wow.

01:12.655 --> 01:15.658
Well, I should tell you if you're planning
to request my father's permission,

01:15.742 --> 01:16.993
he's been dead for 20 years.

01:18.911 --> 01:24.000
How about dinner Saturday night?
I'll pick you up in my horse and buggy.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.835
Great. How's 7:00?

01:25.918 --> 01:29.589
-7:00? What is this, Europe?
-[chuckles]

01:30.465 --> 01:31.508
How about 5:00?

01:32.175 --> 01:33.635
[chuckles] Okay, great.

01:35.470 --> 01:38.055
-Bye, Beau.
-See you then.

01:39.098 --> 01:40.350
[sighs] What the hell.

01:45.104 --> 01:47.106
[theme song playing]

02:55.717 --> 02:56.968
-Hey, Colt.
-Hey.

02:57.969 --> 02:59.304
What's going on? Everything okay?

02:59.387 --> 03:02.515
Yeah. I just, uh,
got back from the doctor's office.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.976
And... I got a new ultrasound.

03:08.771 --> 03:11.023
-That's our kid.
-Yeah, it is.

03:11.107 --> 03:12.275
[both chuckle]

03:13.192 --> 03:15.237
He still kind of looks
like a little alien.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.405
[sighs]

03:17.489 --> 03:19.574
Okay, good. It's not just me. [chuckles]

03:20.783 --> 03:22.285
The doctor was like,
"Isn't your baby cute?"

03:22.368 --> 03:23.620
And all I'm thinkin' was,

03:23.703 --> 03:26.956
"Is this thing gonna burst out of my chest
and kill Sigourney Weaver?" [chuckles]

03:27.039 --> 03:29.834
[chuckles ] Okay,
I'm definitely filmin' the birth now.

03:29.917 --> 03:31.002
[mimics chestburster]

03:31.085 --> 03:32.504
[both chuckle]

03:34.130 --> 03:35.172
Look, Colt,

03:35.257 --> 03:39.093
I know we haven't really gotten a chance
to talk about how we're gonna do this...

03:39.761 --> 03:42.972
-but I got a couple doctor bills.
-No. Say no more. I got it.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.227
-Thank you.
-Yeah, of course.

03:48.436 --> 03:49.521
[mutters]

03:51.356 --> 03:54.651
Two hundred and fifty dollars?
For an ultrasound?

03:55.277 --> 03:58.446
Sears will do a portrait
of your whole family for $29.99.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.326
I thought you said you had insurance.

04:04.286 --> 04:06.162
Yeah, that's after insurance.

04:07.538 --> 04:11.084
-Look, Colt, if it's a problem, I--
-No. No, it's no problem. Just...

04:12.252 --> 04:14.587
didn't realize how expensive
it was gonna be.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.839
Yeah, well,
wait till the kid's actually born.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.091
Darlene has to buy her kids
new clothes all the time.

04:19.175 --> 04:21.093
I mean, eventually,
she just started datin' guys

04:21.177 --> 04:23.137
who had kids six months older than hers.

04:23.220 --> 04:24.806
[engine revving]

04:26.974 --> 04:28.310
-Hey.
-[Rooster] Hey.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.102
-Oh, hey. Let me see.
-[Heather chuckles]

04:30.186 --> 04:31.813
Check it out, Uncle Rooster.

04:31.896 --> 04:33.940
-[both chuckling]
-Oh, that's sweet, man.

04:34.023 --> 04:35.024
Yeah.

04:35.107 --> 04:38.486
Just think, in 12 years, I'm gonna get
this tiny little thing shit-faced drunk.

04:40.071 --> 04:43.283
-I gotta go, but, um, thanks again, Colt.
-Yeah, of course.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.287
Oh, hey, uh... don't worry about Rooster.

04:47.370 --> 04:50.247
The drinkin' age for this kid
is gonna be a hard 14.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.501
What's up?

04:53.585 --> 04:57.088
Oh, need the Bronco.
I got a job up at Rifle today. [chuckles]

04:57.171 --> 05:00.216
The ad said, "Porklift driver needed."

05:00.300 --> 05:02.802
So, either it was a typo,
or I'm pickin' up a bunch of pigs.

05:06.806 --> 05:09.601
I'm going to Abby's tonight.
So when are you gonna be back?

05:09.684 --> 05:14.146
I got no idea.
Probably about an hour after they say,

05:14.230 --> 05:16.358
"All right, that's the last pig, boys.
Head on home."

05:19.276 --> 05:22.530
Hey, uh, them tires on that truck
are gettin' pretty bald.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.741
Slid off the road a couple weeks ago.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.326
-Almost went off a cliff.
-Oh.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.035
Yeah, my whole life
flashed before my eyes.

05:28.119 --> 05:30.413
It was like a  SportsCenter  top ten
of awesome shit.

05:32.582 --> 05:35.167
Number one was the time I met
Kenny Chesney at the Dairy Queen.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.378
He bought me a MooLatté.

05:38.295 --> 05:40.382
Yeah, it was probably real sweet
for him, too.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.550
That's why guys get into music, you know,
to meet other dudes.

05:45.052 --> 05:46.137
Can I just get them keys?

05:46.220 --> 05:48.931
Do you hear me?
That truck needs new tires.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.642
Great. Well then, do it up.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.269
Uh, well, I kinda need your help to:
[mimics Rooster] "Do it up."

05:55.271 --> 05:59.066
-It's our truck, remember?
-Colt, I have no money.

05:59.150 --> 06:01.569
Well, I ain't exactly sittin'
on a ton of money myself.

06:01.653 --> 06:04.989
And I got a baby on the way, man.
I just... I need your help.

06:05.072 --> 06:06.323
All right. Well, here's some help.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.785
Wear a fucking condom.
Woulda only cost you 75 cents.

06:22.214 --> 06:23.215
[gasps]

06:23.299 --> 06:26.469
-Hey, Maggie.
-You've gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.555
Believe it or not,
I've gotten worse welcomes.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.811
Here's everything I took, plus interest.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.355
Okay. Thanks.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.441
Bye.

06:41.859 --> 06:44.361
I'm sorry. I was out of options.

06:45.447 --> 06:48.616
I just needed to get to my next gig,
then I knew I could pay you back.

06:49.325 --> 06:51.035
I had a really good time
with you that night.

06:51.118 --> 06:53.496
I don't want you thinking it was
just a way to get your guard down.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.872
Why would I think that?

06:55.457 --> 06:57.374
Oh, yeah. You fucking robbed me.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.044
I really am sorry.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.254
And you know the worst part?

07:02.338 --> 07:05.174
I didn't make any money at that gig,
so I had to rob them to pay you back.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.680
-Too soon for that joke?
-You think?

07:15.810 --> 07:18.229
Here, I got you this.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.148
A kachina doll?

07:21.232 --> 07:23.901
You said your mom was part Chippewa,
so I thought you might like it.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.571
This is the Hopi trickster god.

07:26.654 --> 07:29.949
This little guy is supposed to have
the power to bring change to your life.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.325
He's also a bottle opener.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.788
Is his ass a cigarette lighter?

07:38.625 --> 07:41.377
You said you wanted to visit all 50 states
and you never got to do it.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.754
Hopefully he fixes that.

07:43.713 --> 07:47.424
Well... never had anyone take my money
and buy me a gift with it.

07:47.509 --> 07:51.053
Actually, that's not true.
My sons do it every year on my birthday.

07:52.429 --> 07:55.933
Look, Clint,
I appreciate you payin' me back.

07:57.059 --> 07:59.812
And honestly, I'm surprised
you remember I wanted to travel.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.524
-But if you think this makes up for--
-I don't.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.735
I'm just trying to do
what I think is right.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.740
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

08:10.823 --> 08:13.242
-You should get the fuck out now.
-Right.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.712
Hey, Colt, will you give me a hand?

08:31.761 --> 08:33.846
Oh, right, forgot.
No sense of humor.

08:34.388 --> 08:35.389
What's wrong?

08:36.808 --> 08:39.268
The generator. Damn thing went out again.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.729
But I'm sure you'll be able to fix it.

08:41.813 --> 08:44.023
See, I've got a great sense of humor.

08:46.317 --> 08:49.236
It's got a fuse out?
Got some corrosion on the terminals?

08:49.320 --> 08:50.446
Electric starter broke?

08:51.698 --> 08:54.116
You gonna ask me if it's out of gas next?

08:55.743 --> 08:57.411
Well, not now. [scoffs]

08:58.329 --> 08:59.330
Want me to call Rooster?

08:59.413 --> 09:01.248
-He fixed it last time.
-No. Nope.

09:04.043 --> 09:08.380
You know, he is the generator whisperer.
And that ain't exaggerated either.

09:08.464 --> 09:12.259
He literally leans in and pats it, says,
"Come on, baby, tell Daddy what's wrong."

09:14.303 --> 09:15.805
We'll fix it ourselves.

09:19.601 --> 09:23.020
Hey, uh... I really didn't
wanna ask you this, but...

09:24.355 --> 09:27.483
-would it be possible if I got a raise?
-Sure.

09:28.275 --> 09:30.945
There's my delightful sense
of humor again.

09:33.906 --> 09:37.451
Yeah. No, it's... for a good reason.

09:37.534 --> 09:39.912
I told Heather
I'd help out with medical bills.

09:40.663 --> 09:43.290
I don't think I realized
how expensive havin' a baby is.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.293
No, it's like... like an Xbox, you know?

09:46.377 --> 09:47.837
Think it's only gonna be
a couple hundred bucks

09:47.920 --> 09:51.090
and then you gotta get the games
and the controller and the headset.

09:53.593 --> 09:57.513
That's right, Colt.
Having a child is just like an Xbox.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.309
Hey, I was just hopin'
you'd give me a hand.

10:10.026 --> 10:14.071
Look... things are pretty tight
around here right now.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.240
We've got cows
to get through the winter.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.868
Gotta hire a new man in the spring.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.371
I'd love to help you two out, but...

10:23.330 --> 10:25.374
all I can spare is a couple hundred bucks
right now.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.627
Yeah, I understand.

10:28.252 --> 10:29.879
Kids don't come cheap, Colt.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.341
When your mother got pregnant,
we had to sit down,

10:34.425 --> 10:36.552
work out a real strict budget.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.971
You know we used to have Broncos seats?

10:40.347 --> 10:42.224
We gave those up for you and Rooster.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.645
Wow. No wonder you hate us.

10:45.728 --> 10:46.854
[chuckles]

10:50.232 --> 10:53.610
Well, I'm just saying,
bein' a parent means making sacrifices.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.116
Whatever it takes, I'm ready.

10:59.826 --> 11:03.830
You know, I missed the Broncos winnin'
the '87 AFC Championship

11:03.913 --> 11:07.249
because Rooster was playing'
a fuckin' tree in  Peter Pan.

11:12.964 --> 11:15.174
Hey, Mom, what's 12 times 24?

11:15.758 --> 11:16.801
Two hundred eighty-eight.

11:19.136 --> 11:23.224
-How'd you do that so fast?
-I imagined 12 cases of beer.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.562
Oh, you know,
the last time I saw you doing math,

11:28.645 --> 11:32.649
you were figuring out how many days
of community service you had left.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.403
Wait, are you really doing math?

11:36.487 --> 11:39.115
Or are you just writin' "boobs"
on a calculator?

11:41.075 --> 11:44.620
No. I'm comin' up with a budget to
figure out how I can help with the baby.

11:45.412 --> 11:49.250
Think I covered all the essentials.
I got food, water, shelter, beer.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.376
[Abby chuckles]

11:50.459 --> 11:51.753
Don't forget Xbox.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.005
Well, shit!

11:56.007 --> 11:58.550
All right. Goodbye, food. [chuckles]

12:00.011 --> 12:02.179
[sighs] Got to figure out
how to make this work.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.556
-You know, I have a little money saved up.
-No.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.100
Why not? I could help.

12:06.183 --> 12:07.684
I'm not lettin' my girlfriend pay

12:07.769 --> 12:09.937
for the baby I'm having
with my ex-girlfriend.

12:11.688 --> 12:13.357
Yeah, when you say it like that,
it's a hard sell.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.153
Guess I'm gonna have to get a second job.

12:17.736 --> 12:20.156
Do you remember, uh, Craig Toomin?

12:20.239 --> 12:23.159
He was the Garrison Mustang
our junior year.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.827
Oh, hell, yeah.

12:24.911 --> 12:28.372
Yeah, I dared that guy
to hump the Lakewood Buffalo.

12:29.706 --> 12:31.793
Didn't realize it was gonna be
a real buffalo. [chuckles]

12:33.002 --> 12:34.045
[Abby chuckles]

12:34.128 --> 12:35.462
Yeah, he still did it.

12:36.923 --> 12:40.843
Well, he is the manager at Safeway.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.304
I ain't working at fuckin' Safeway.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.515
I don't know.
I mean, he came in for career day,

12:46.598 --> 12:48.517
and he made it sound pretty good.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.936
He got four applications.

12:50.019 --> 12:53.689
Although, to be fair,
one of them was from Hugh G. Rection.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.275
Oh. [laughing]

12:59.987 --> 13:01.488
-No.
-That's funny!

13:01.572 --> 13:02.949
No.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.616
Oh, my God, now, what would I do though?

13:04.700 --> 13:06.535
Like, run the meat department
or somethin'?

13:06.618 --> 13:07.954
[laughing]

13:09.538 --> 13:12.583
I don't think you're qualified
to run the meat department.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.419
I could run the shit
out of the meat department.

13:16.795 --> 13:18.923
Quarter pound of ground beef. What else?

13:21.217 --> 13:22.301
[sighs] Hey.

13:22.384 --> 13:23.469
Oh, hey, man.

13:23.552 --> 13:26.472
-How'd that job in Rifle go?
-Yeah, it was all right.

13:26.555 --> 13:30.726
Turns out it was a forklift operator,
but I was loadin' pallets of bacon,

13:30.809 --> 13:32.186
so it was kind of both.

13:33.896 --> 13:36.190
Hey, uh, the genny broke again.

13:36.273 --> 13:38.192
Any way you could stop by later,
take a look at it?

13:38.775 --> 13:40.027
Yeah, I'll swing by.

13:40.111 --> 13:42.696
And be honest now,
am I fixing the original problem?

13:42.779 --> 13:44.198
Or what you broke trying to fix it?

13:45.741 --> 13:48.244
Very funny. Little bit of both.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.246
Thanks, Mom.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.208
Hi, Maggie.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.418
Hi, what are you doing here?

13:56.502 --> 13:58.587
Oh, what do you mean?
This is a great place.

13:58.670 --> 14:00.923
I like the club soda,
and I really like the bartender.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.799
Okay, slow down.

14:02.884 --> 14:04.760
Yeah, slow down.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.349
Mom, this guy botherin' you?

14:10.432 --> 14:12.476
-Want me to kick the shit out of him?
-Colt.

14:12.559 --> 14:15.021
Yeah, relax, Colt.
You can't even fix a generator.

14:16.688 --> 14:19.316
This guy bothering you, Mom?
Want me to kick the shit out of him?

14:21.110 --> 14:25.281
Okay, now you've met my charming sons,
so you know why I stopped at two.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.074
Would you like to sit?

14:28.450 --> 14:30.286
I'm surprised to see you're still in town.

14:30.369 --> 14:33.873
Oh, it turns out Garrison
is quite the tourist destination.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.624
There's the feed store, the Dairy Queen,

14:35.707 --> 14:39.128
the Yarn Barn, the...
bench in front of the Yarn Barn.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.381
I booked a gig at Duke's Smokehouse

14:42.464 --> 14:44.466
in Grand Junction tomorrow night.
You should stop by.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.511
Oh, I can't leave the bar.
These people need me.

14:47.594 --> 14:50.389
You've walked around the town.
Alcohol is all we have.

14:51.515 --> 14:54.060
Well, if you change your mind,
your name is on the list.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.062
And let me know
if you wanna invite any of them.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.438
Them?

15:03.735 --> 15:05.112

15:09.408 --> 15:11.785
Well, this thing is pretty fucked.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.914
Really only one other thing I can try.

15:21.337 --> 15:24.423
Come on, baby.
Daddy needs to hear you purr.

15:37.811 --> 15:39.396

15:41.440 --> 15:44.735
[chuckles] Anyway, I miss this.

15:45.569 --> 15:50.157
Workin' together. Messin' with each other.
Dad's jokes are just mean.

15:50.241 --> 15:54.370
Other day, we were by the river, he said,
"Hey, you wanna see a magic trick?"

15:54.453 --> 15:57.248
I said, "Sure."
He said, "Watch me disappear."

15:57.331 --> 15:59.416
He just drove off
and fuckin' left me there.

16:03.587 --> 16:06.382
Yeah, that's better than when he says,
"You wanna see my boot disappear?"

16:06.465 --> 16:07.591
Trust me.

16:09.385 --> 16:12.346
You know...
you could come work here with us.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.140
I ain't working for Dad again.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.475
Ah, come on.
You're just being stubborn.

16:16.558 --> 16:17.934
You need a ranchin' job.

16:18.019 --> 16:19.853
-[sighs]
-In the spring, we got one to offer.

-[laughing]

16:23.274 --> 16:24.691
The fuck, man?

16:26.027 --> 16:28.195
You do that to an employee,
it's just assault.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.198
-[vehicle approaching]
-Goddamn.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.369
Well, he made it pretty clear
he doesn't want me back, so...

16:35.452 --> 16:39.206
Well, Dad's gettin' pretty old.
Maybe we can convince him you never left.

16:43.835 --> 16:45.337
What the fuck is he doin' here?

16:45.421 --> 16:46.463
Never mind.

16:47.964 --> 16:50.926
-Rooster fixed the generator.
-Yeah. You're welcome.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.096
-All right. See you later.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.514
[chuckling]

16:56.265 --> 16:57.641
I did miss that.

16:58.892 --> 17:00.477
We could do this every day.

17:01.770 --> 17:02.813
[groans]

17:02.896 --> 17:04.773
I told you not to ask Rooster.

17:06.900 --> 17:07.901
He fixed it.

17:09.486 --> 17:11.947
You know, this don't make any sense.

17:12.573 --> 17:14.241
He needs a job and we got one to give.

17:14.325 --> 17:16.827
I offered him the job.
He turned it down.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.370
Did you offer it to him?

17:19.455 --> 17:23.417
Or did you just make him feel like shit
for getting fired and not having a job?

17:24.501 --> 17:27.003
See, it's how you say things, Dad.

17:27.088 --> 17:28.922
Like this morning when you said,

17:29.005 --> 17:30.966
[mimics Beau]
"Why's the fucking coffee burnt?"

17:32.843 --> 17:34.303
What you could've said was,

17:34.386 --> 17:37.389
"Hey, son, thanks for waking up early
and making me coffee.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.725
Next time, I prefer a lighter roast."

17:42.018 --> 17:45.189
We're not hiring Rooster.
And I'm done with this conversation.

17:46.773 --> 17:48.442
We're better off havin' him here.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.237
You guys gotta get over this little fight.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.904
You're always sayin' family first.

17:52.988 --> 17:55.741
Well, why don't you swallow your pride
and do what's best for the family?

17:55.824 --> 17:58.660
Hey, son, watch this.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.496
Abra-fucking-cadabra.

18:10.964 --> 18:13.259
-Hey, Beau. [sighs]
-Hey, Joanne.

18:13.342 --> 18:16.512
So I was gonna bring you some flowers,
and then I decided,

18:17.096 --> 18:18.722
why not bring Four Roses?

18:20.224 --> 18:22.851
Bourbon. I'll go put this in some water.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.396
Ready to go?

18:25.479 --> 18:28.190
About tonight, uh,
might have to change our plans a little.

18:28.274 --> 18:32.111
Well, I'm flexible.
We don't have to eat at the Golden Corral.

18:32.694 --> 18:35.114
We can get Golden Corral to go.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.658
Actually, uh, my granddaughter's here.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.870
Her mom was supposed to pick her up
an hour ago. I haven't heard from her yet.

18:41.953 --> 18:44.248
Oh, and I tried to call you
before you got all the way out here.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.542
Yeah. Sorry.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.753
Colt turned my ringer off
a while back for church.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.548
I can't figure out how to turn it back on.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.717
So, I think I need a rain check.

18:56.427 --> 19:01.056
Unless you want our first date to include
fish sticks and mac and cheese.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.185
That's pretty much what I was gonna order
at the Golden Corral.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.313
-Well, come on in.
-Thank you.

19:11.525 --> 19:12.943
Who do we have here?

19:13.902 --> 19:16.029
Nicole, I'd like you to meet
my friend Beau.

19:16.112 --> 19:18.907
-Hi.
-Hi there, Nicole.

19:18.990 --> 19:20.742
Let me see your phone.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.786
-What?
-Come on, let me see your phone.

19:25.747 --> 19:29.210
Nicole, can you turn on
Beau's ringer for him?

19:30.544 --> 19:32.713
I've been fiddling with that thing
for weeks.

19:32.796 --> 19:34.340
Can't imagine she's gonna fix it.

the more you drink, the better I sound.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.207
Hey. I didn't think you were comin'.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.000
Oh, I didn't come to see you.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.794
I came to warn the bartender
to lock the register.

20:13.920 --> 20:16.965
You joke, but if you distract him,
I'll cut you in for half.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.886
-You guys need somethin'?
-Uh, I got this.

20:20.969 --> 20:23.472

Oh, actually, I'm a bartender, too,
so keep it simple.

20:32.188 --> 20:34.858
I'll just have whatever's on tap.
Or a bottle.

I'll just have a club soda, too.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.738
No, you know what? Fuck that.

I'll have a Sapphire martini,

are only good for draft beer.

Family first. Got to stock shelves
to take care of my kid,

25:25.691 --> 25:26.983
I'll stock shelves.

25:27.734 --> 25:29.695
Holy shit! You're a stock boy?

25:31.071 --> 25:33.740
What happened?
Walmart doesn't need no greeters?

25:35.158 --> 25:37.285
Look, I know this isn't easy for you.

25:38.787 --> 25:41.623
It wasn't my first choice, but it'll do.

25:41.707 --> 25:44.751
Four or five nights a week.
That's 20 hours, 200 bucks.

25:44.835 --> 25:47.003
Plus, they're lettin' me bring home
all the damaged fruit.

25:47.087 --> 25:49.255
Anyone want a bruised peach or...

25:50.757 --> 25:53.509
what we'll call brown berries?

25:55.345 --> 25:56.680
I'm proud of you, Colt.

25:58.014 --> 26:00.183
Here. You want a cookie?

26:00.266 --> 26:01.727
Oh, thank you.

26:02.352 --> 26:03.519
They got walnuts in them.

26:07.315 --> 26:08.399
Walnuts got pot in 'em?

26:13.238 --> 26:14.530
So... [sighs]

26:16.825 --> 26:19.786
-you happy you came?
-[chuckles] Are you kidding?

26:19.870 --> 26:23.539
This is just what I needed.
I never do stuff like this.

26:23.624 --> 26:27.669
I told the bartender my name was Cindy.
[laughing]

26:29.587 --> 26:31.715
No real reason. I just felt like it.

26:32.758 --> 26:35.927
Okay. Somebody used
both their drink tickets, didn't you?

26:36.011 --> 26:37.387
[chuckling]

26:37.470 --> 26:41.099
I'm just saying, you know?
Here, I'm not a bartender,

26:41.182 --> 26:43.559
I'm not someone's mother,
I'm not someone's ex-wife.

26:43.644 --> 26:47.898
I'm just me.
Cindy from Tulsa. [chuckles]

26:49.524 --> 26:50.901
You got a whole backstory, huh?

26:50.984 --> 26:53.695
Oh, yeah. I'm wanted by the FBI.
No big deal.

26:55.155 --> 26:59.701
Just, seriously, thank you, thank you,
thank you for asking me.

26:59.785 --> 27:02.788
-I had such a good time.
-It's nice to have somebody to play for.

27:03.664 --> 27:06.499
[grunts] Wanna grab a bite to eat?

27:07.834 --> 27:10.837
Oh, I was thinkin' we'd do somethin' else.

27:10.921 --> 27:12.297
Sure. What'd you have in mind?

27:21.973 --> 27:23.641
Okay, that's way better than my idea.

27:27.938 --> 27:29.064
[knocking on door]

27:29.815 --> 27:30.816
Yeah.

27:36.487 --> 27:37.989
-Hey.
-Hey.

27:39.407 --> 27:40.491
Can I have some of that?

27:43.119 --> 27:44.579
Yeah, sure. It's your whiskey.

27:47.665 --> 27:48.959
[Rooster sighs]

27:51.377 --> 27:52.462
[Beau] Mmm.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.761
We gotta stop this.

28:00.511 --> 28:02.263
-Drinkin'?
-God, no.

28:04.682 --> 28:06.017
This.

28:06.101 --> 28:09.730
I want you to come back,
work on the ranch.

28:10.396 --> 28:14.484
[inhales] Dad... we've been through this.

28:14.567 --> 28:16.820
I know you want to run your own ranch.

28:17.528 --> 28:20.073
And if that opportunity comes along,
I want you to take it.

28:21.449 --> 28:24.494
I've always said family comes first.

28:27.205 --> 28:29.249
I've lost sight of that more than anyone.

28:31.376 --> 28:32.502
I'd agree with that.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.507
But I'd also say I'm not free of blame.

28:38.258 --> 28:39.718
I would agree with that.

28:42.303 --> 28:43.471
So what do you say?

28:47.308 --> 28:48.434
I'm your number two?

28:48.518 --> 28:49.728
[chuckles]

28:50.561 --> 28:51.730
Talk to your brother.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.690
-I'm your number two.
-All right.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.195
We got a deal?

29:02.073 --> 29:03.574
[Rooster sighs]

29:03.658 --> 29:04.785
Yes, sir.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.161
See you in the morning.

29:07.913 --> 29:08.914
Right.

29:10.373 --> 29:12.000
-Rooster...
-Mmm?

29:12.083 --> 29:14.460
Don't drink so much you're fuckin' late.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.177
