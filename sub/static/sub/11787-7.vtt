NIKITA: Six years ago,
I was taken from prison...

00:04.963 --> 00:08.455
...and forced to become an assassin
for a secret unit of the government:

00:08.634 --> 00:11.797
Black-ops program called Division
that has now gone rogue.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.507
They destroyed my identity
and the man I loved.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.089
I escaped...

...but there are others
who suffered my fate.

against their will.

has inﬁltrated their ranks...

00:26.068 --> 00:28.480

we'll free as many as we can.

to take down Division.

01:18.203 --> 01:21.661
During this sim,
while you are trying to survive...

01:21.873 --> 01:26.867
...you only have a second
to decide who is your friend...

01:27.462 --> 01:29.202

-Yeah. Can hear me on the thingy. Fine.

Can't I just read Us Weekly
or something?
